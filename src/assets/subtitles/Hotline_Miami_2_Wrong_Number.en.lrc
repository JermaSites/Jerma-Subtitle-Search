[00:01.64]Hello everybody.
[00:04.93]Sorry I'm late again.
[00:05.91]I said last night I was like, you know, we're not gonna be late today, but then I had to get some stuff ready.
[00:11.07]I had to do some stuff.
[00:13.21]Like it typically is.
[00:15.15]I want to be starting at like 3.30, 3-ish PM Pacific time, but man are we pushing that forward now.
[00:25.42]This isn't an outlier though.
[00:26.92]Don't expect streams to start like this.
[00:30.66]Really gonna be trying to stay consistently like we were for the first couple of months here.
[00:36.20]At like 5 to 6 p.m.
[00:38.02]Eastern.
[00:38.38]Around like 3-ish p.m.
[00:40.16]Pacific.
[00:42.47]Oh, I got the wrong... What's even on the title right now?
[00:45.37]Birdhouse Done.
[00:46.53]Pretty... Oh, fuck.
[00:47.39]Hold on.
[00:53.44]Hotline.
[00:53.94]Yes, this is dog.
[00:54.82]I don't know.
[01:02.30]I need it just for a second.
[01:03.50]I'll change it in a second.
[01:09.38]There we go.
[01:09.72]Okay.
[01:10.40]Is it changed?
[01:10.96]Because I want to make sure that the VOD is going to be all fucked up if I don't do that.
[01:18.71]That was a... I had a tenth of a second to figure that.
[01:21.33]I'm going to change that title.
[01:22.21]Don't worry.
[01:24.49]I'm going to play Hotline Miami 2 tonight.
[01:27.79]I need to put these tea bags somewhere.
[01:30.27]I have two tea bags that I don't know what to do with, and I'm not putting them on my nice desk.
[01:35.05]I guess they can go right here.
[01:42.68]Hello, yes, this is dog.
[01:44.00]Yeah, I know that's a terrible fucking shitty title.
[01:47.98]Just give me like, just give me like a 15 second minute.
[01:54.32]I gotta get these tea bags out of here.
[01:57.93]It's not gonna go through, right?
[02:00.35]I'll just get rid of him when I take a break here in a little bit.
[02:04.06]But anyways, I hope you guys are doing well.
[02:06.66]Let me just make a tweet and we will get started.
[02:08.88]Give me one minute.
[03:37.21]Okay.
[03:39.93]As the, uh, motorcycle goes by.
[03:44.43]So, yeah, Hotline Miami 2.
[03:46.31]Welcome, everybody.
[03:47.03]I got a mission from the birdhouse yesterday.
[03:49.22]The chair isn't on the right spot.
[03:50.82]I need to move that.
[03:54.60]Why is it... Alright, there we go.
[03:56.48]Is that better?
[03:56.90]Does that feel better?
[03:58.68]My mousepad... This is a gamer game.
[04:01.28]I gotta make sure my mousepad's in the right place.
[04:05.68]Oh, sorry, I bumped you.
[04:08.14]Okay.
[04:09.80]I think... I think I'm ready.
[04:13.98]How's the bird doing?
[04:15.28]Uh, bird's doing alright.
[04:17.72]What bird?
[04:19.34]What?
[04:20.28]Oh, the bird house.
[04:21.78]Okay, I got a bird now.
[04:26.80]I'm never gonna finish this game.
[04:27.90]Well, I finished the last one.
[04:30.40]Is this one... worse than the last one?
[04:37.06]Alright, I'm gonna do a new game.
[04:39.12]I'm ready.
[04:39.52]Gonna get the first act coming in here.
[04:46.73]And, uh, you need the audio too, don't you?
[04:52.63]Uh, it's kind of quiet.
[04:53.99]Like, very quiet.
[04:55.35]For some reason.
[04:57.17]I'll put it on in a minute here.
[04:58.13]Hold on, don't worry.
[05:00.61]Uh, man, this party stinks.
[05:01.59]I fucking hate these people.
[05:04.89]Who invited all these morons?
[05:09.21]Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
[05:13.31]What do you guys think about tonight?
[05:14.83]We gonna do it?
[05:16.62]Oh, my door.
[05:17.26]I gotta close my door.
[05:17.96]Okay, there we go.
[05:27.38]He's talking about chat.
[05:31.55]Where's the face cam?
[05:32.45]I'll...
[05:35.31]Just... God damn it.
[05:37.57]Do you guys really want a camera?
[05:39.59]Do I have to put a face cam on?
[05:40.79]Alright, well, let me get to the end of the cutscene.
[05:44.49]Just wait.
[05:44.81]What do you guys think about tonight?
[05:46.71]Are we gonna do it?
[05:48.35]I don't see why not.
[05:49.11]I'm sick of this shit.
[05:51.31]Yeah, let's do it.
[05:52.01]I like that the duckbill guy's my favorite.
[05:55.38]The weapons are in the car, right?
[05:57.68]So we are actually doing this.
[06:01.04]I thought he was gonna scream.
[06:01.92]He has a screaming face.
[06:04.20]Game audio?
[06:04.82]I know, I know!
[06:05.36]I gotta get to the end of the cutscene!
[06:06.66]I can't- If I hit escape, then I'm gonna like, fuck it all up, aren't I?
[06:10.94]Let's do it.
[06:11.44]Alright, here we go.
[06:12.96]Why was that so loud?
[06:17.52]Why is this so much louder than the game?
[06:24.33]What the fuck?
[06:25.95]Alright, this-
[06:34.42]Is that better?
[06:35.92]Don't ask me why the menu for some reason is five times louder than the actual video game.
[06:42.26]I feel like I'm shooting you guys with a fucking laser.
[06:50.97]How's that?
[06:53.93]It's a little better, right?
[06:59.45]Louder.
[07:05.50]Uh, I don't, I can't, why can I not go any louder?
[07:09.02]What the fuck is happening?
[07:12.86]Why is my volume mixer so fucked up?
[07:17.17]Does that help?
[07:21.31]No, dude, I'm at max fucking volume on Windows.
[07:26.17]Well, that's, okay.
[07:32.53]Odd, but whatever.
[07:35.30]Alright, so... That's... I guess that's as loud as I can fucking make it.
[07:43.00]That's what it's gonna have to be like, apparently.
[07:44.78]Alright, here we go.
[07:48.85]Uh, party sucks.
[07:51.65]WASD, just like the last game.
[07:52.91]There's a guy puking in there.
[07:53.89]I can leave through here, get in the van.
[07:57.05]Wow, that's so much loud!
[07:58.99]What the hell is happening right now?! !
[08:02.69]What is going on?
[08:03.53]This just shouldn't be like this.
[08:16.18]Alright.
[08:17.06]What in the name of God was that all about?
[08:18.74]That can't be that fucking loud.
[08:23.10]That's too loud.
[08:23.91]I think that's a reasonable level.
[08:30.79]Maybe like one more.
[08:32.72]Alright.
[08:36.84]I don't even need a fucking tutorial at all.
[08:38.86]I'm a goddamn natural.
[08:39.86]Look at how loud this is!
[08:40.98]Are you sure about this?
[08:44.06]What the fuck?
[08:51.85]Turn on face cam.
[08:53.63]Oh my god, fine.
[08:54.75]Jesus Christ.
[09:08.04]I gotta go through this door, I think?
[09:09.77]Yep.
[09:10.99]I think that's it.
[09:17.21]How do I open the door?
[09:21.77]Oh.
[09:23.64]Can you not just open doors like this?
[09:26.48]No, you can.
[09:29.84]Something's wrong with my audio sync.
[09:33.66]I can't really fix it, so... You're gonna have to deal with it for now.
[09:40.71]Ooh, that hurt.
[09:48.69]There's no more bullets in that gun.
[09:51.74]What do I have here?
[09:52.42]What the fuck?
[10:02.27]Alright.
[10:02.73]How many bullets do I have?
[10:04.27]Where do I see?
[10:04.79]Oh, just empty.
[10:05.71]Combo beginner.
[10:06.43]Nice.
[10:06.73]Okay.
[10:07.35]That's cool.
[10:13.86]Ooh, almost didn't get it.
[10:16.15]No, give me that.
[10:16.59]What are you guys saying?
[10:26.17]Fuck.
[10:33.95]Get it?
[10:34.47]Okay.
[10:36.13]Ah.
[10:37.81]Ah.
[10:42.18]Oh my god, okay.
[10:43.14]I gotta pay attention.
[10:51.29]Oh, shift!
[10:51.79]I forgot I could do shift.
[10:52.69]I forgot about that.
[10:53.43]Damn it!
[10:56.93]I'm just gonna go fucking fast, man.
[11:00.34]Fuck it.
[11:00.76]No, I'm not.
[11:10.52]Holy shit, how did I stay alive?
[11:11.98]Alright, slow it down.
[11:18.07]This is kind of hard for the first level.
[11:24.73]I guess I could go in the left room.
[11:26.61]I need a melee weapon.
[11:27.66]I'm alerting the whole horde.
[11:39.78]Okay.
[11:41.70]That works?
[11:42.54]Who the fuck are you?
[11:44.44]Oh god.
[11:51.02]Alright.
[11:51.86]Only one more guy and then... That's it, right?
[11:55.48]Just one more guy?
[11:56.20]Alright, got it.
[12:04.19]That was fucking ridiculous.
[12:08.63]Mmm.
[12:09.67]I got these bags, though.
[12:11.96]Whatever.
[12:19.00]Go to car.
[12:23.22]I don't- where is the... Is the car down a level, or what?
[12:27.57]No, it's right here.
[12:37.87]What the fuck?
[12:41.21]What are you guys saying?
[12:42.31]Entire stream is broken.
[12:43.55]What's wrong with my stream?
[12:50.57]I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I don't know... If there's a problem with the stream, then I can't really fix it, so... I'm sorry.
[12:58.29]Alright.
[13:08.25]Happy Halloween, sir.
[13:12.11]It'll be 14.50, so your pizzas are on the counter.
[13:16.07]Okay, cool.
[13:19.11]Enjoy your meal and watch out for ghosts tonight.
[13:20.67]Okay.
[13:22.51]Bye.
[13:24.39]More free food.
[13:25.07]That's pretty cool.
[13:25.58]I like that.
[13:38.83]I don't understand!
[13:39.93]Turn off the cam?
[13:40.75]What the fuck are you guys talking about?
[13:41.83]Fine, turn cam off.
[13:46.84]What's going on?
[13:49.20]Turn it back on and sync it.
[14:04.40]Is it fixed now?
[14:05.06]Is it better?

[14:59.97]There we go, okay.
[15:04.21]There we go, nice.
[15:11.30]Okay.
[15:14.42]I can't believe what they've been doing...
[15:19.37]Should probably go home and get some sleep.
[15:29.77]Alright, you have a nice night.
[15:33.42]You too, sweetheart.
[15:34.48]Okay.
[15:37.60]I don't know what that means, but it's fine.
[15:42.28]Go to the car, I guess.
[15:47.03]I don't... I mean, I think I have to... Second scene.
[15:52.68]I... I'm playing without fucking headphones tonight, guys.
[15:55.28]I don't like the sounds, they scare me.
[16:06.85]Got it.
[16:15.62]Got it.
[16:21.64]Ah, that's blocking the shit.
[16:23.32]Hold on.
[16:26.12]Got it.
[16:28.08]Ah, wait.
[16:28.36]Watch out for the guy in the room.
[16:29.44]I gotta be careful here.
[16:37.51]Sound effects are too loud.
[16:38.33]The music is... Hold on.
[16:39.79]I can fix it.
[16:40.25]Hold on.
[16:40.67]Give me a second.
[16:44.57]Maybe that'll help.
[16:45.29]Better?
[16:45.49]What happened to my cursor?
[16:49.27]Okay, there we go.
[16:52.59]I think that's good.
[16:54.89]Yeah, I think we're good.
[16:58.91]One guy in here.
[16:59.43]Two guys, actually.
[17:00.13]Let's go... Let's try to get a door, and then smash, right?
[17:02.93]Ooh, that guy didn't see me.
[17:06.27]How?
[17:07.27]Empty!
[17:07.79]Empty!
[17:08.49]Empty!
[17:09.73]We're good.
[17:14.85]There we go.
[17:15.51]Up the floor, and we're good.
[17:17.27]That should get us up there.
[17:21.89]This way.
[17:22.37]Oh, I thought that- I didn't think that was a wall.
[17:24.01]Oops-a-daisy.
[17:24.67]Fuck!
[17:30.39]Fuck!
[17:36.15]Dammit.
[17:44.70]Oh my god.
[17:45.38]This is too stressful for me!
[17:51.58]Can you believe this shit?
[17:53.52]I think I got him.
[18:05.15]Ah, I just gave it to him.
[18:14.20]Ooh, that was close.
[18:15.34]That was real...
[18:28.25]Anymore?
[18:34.19]I don't think there's anymore.
[18:40.96]Ayayayayayayayayayay!
[18:43.18]Fuck!
[18:44.30]Oh my god, I blown it!
[18:45.58]Ugh!
[18:47.18]Fuck!
[18:59.16]Alright, I'll get it.
[18:59.75]I'll be fine.
[19:08.49]Don't worry, everything's gonna be fine.
[19:09.73]I got it.
[19:10.08]Alright, let me think about this logically here.
[19:18.68]I'm gonna say...
[19:21.12]Punch through door.
[19:22.03]Kick guy.
[19:23.13]Get them both in two shots.
[19:24.11]One shot, three shot.
[19:24.83]Got it.
[19:25.27]Nice.
[19:26.83]Alright.
[19:27.63]Just... How many guys down here?
[19:29.53]Just the two, right?
[19:34.55]Oh, come on.
[19:36.01]That was lucky.
[19:36.65]Alright.
[19:37.20]Oh, we got one guy.
[19:39.08]What about down there, though?
[19:40.00]I'm scared to even go down there.
[19:45.46]It's just... One, two, three.
[19:47.14]I should get them very quickly here.
[19:52.18]The door got in the fucking way again.
[19:53.46]Got it.
[20:01.54]Okay.
[20:04.34]Go to the car.
[20:14.39]Well, this isn't good.
[20:15.37]Do I have to fight this?
[20:16.57]Am I in trouble here?
[20:25.42]Drop your weapon and get down on the ground now.
[20:27.19]I'm gonna dump shoot.
[20:29.31]I'm a detective.
[20:29.95]Here's my badge.
[20:30.67]I'm sorry, sir.
[20:35.75]Lower your weapons, boys.
[20:36.77]What's the situation in there?
[20:40.33]I heard gunfire.
[20:41.12]Yeah, you go look for yourself.
[20:43.24]It's a bloodbath in there.
[20:45.82]Man, sometimes I hate this city.
[20:49.13]Go to the car, okay.
[20:51.03]That's kind of interesting.
[20:52.05]I go to the car.
[20:53.97]Which car?
[20:54.51]My car or their car?
[20:58.07]Okay, there it is.
[21:01.11]Nice.
[21:01.33]C+.
[21:26.40]Alright, that's fine.
[21:27.38]It's first level.
[21:37.11]C plus streamer strikes again.
[21:38.93]That was the worst joke this year.
[21:45.28]That was the last... What do you mean?
[21:48.86]I don't know what you're talking about.
[22:00.12]Turn the facecam back on.
[22:01.72]I'll turn it back on when I feel like it's necessary to turn back on.
[22:11.05]Another murder case, huh?
[22:13.07]Yeah, looks like you've got a serial killer on your hands.
[22:18.84]Same MO as the guy you found last week, message and all.
[22:23.90]I'm innocent.
[22:24.52]They forced me to do it.
[22:25.48]Yeah, right.
[22:25.94]I haven't heard that before.
[22:27.78]The guy must be some kind of psycho, huh?
[22:29.48]Creeps me out.
[22:34.12]Guess it'll make the press happy though.
[22:45.57]Guess it'll make it happy, I guess.
[22:56.31]I don't know.
[22:57.05]I have, uh, no idea.
[22:58.35]Seems they need, uh, pockets of love before they even... This just seems a bit too standard, no gore details.
[23:14.85]God, this city sure makes your skin thick, doesn't it?
[23:19.86]I I was born with thick skin.
[23:23.28]Have you guys found any clues?
[23:26.30]Not really.
[23:26.70]He got his throat slit.
[23:27.68]Haven't found the murder weapon yet.
[23:31.27]No fingerprints.
[23:31.95]No witnesses.
[23:32.99]Nothing.
[23:34.03]I'll let you know anything turns up.
[23:35.16]Alright!
[23:36.04]Fucking bye!
[23:38.72]Bye!
[23:57.58]You do that.
[23:58.44]I'll head down to the station and get started on the paperwork.
[24:07.05]Alright, have a nice night, sir.
[24:10.33]Yeah, we'll see about that.
[24:15.13]I don't know about that.
[24:37.29]I don't know.
[24:41.71]What?
[24:46.24]I don't know, man.
[24:46.76]Who knows?
[24:48.44]I think it's kind of an issue.
[24:55.97]Yeah, I get it.
[25:19.57]I'm sorry, you're a fucking dork?
[25:21.66]Hey!
[25:23.70]I'm just trying to enjoy Hotline Miami 2 with Cam tonight.
[25:40.00]Yeah!
[25:48.64]Let's see what happens here.
[25:51.89]Oh, what the hell?
[25:52.53]Who am I?
[25:53.83]A new character?
[26:02.87]Good day, this is Eric from Miami Auto Repair.
[26:05.03]I'm calling to tell you that we have finished service.
[26:09.11]Hello, who is this?
[26:09.91]Let me talk to your boss, okay?
[26:13.10]Swing on by North 12th Avenue place and pick.
[26:17.08]Hey, I'm talking here.
[26:18.00]We guarantee you the best service in town.
[26:23.48]Click.
[26:24.88]Don't you hang up on me, damn it.
[26:27.46]Show some goddamn respect.
[26:31.15]This looks like fat me.
[26:33.69]No, it doesn't.
[26:35.93]Just watch me fucking ace this round.
[26:49.84]Is this a new character?
[26:54.38]Third scene, hard news.
[26:58.94]This is where it happens.
[26:59.71]They gotta get the fucking cam on for this one, you know what I'm saying?
[27:02.37]Lethal throws.
[27:04.13]Yeah, let's get it on.
[27:04.77]Let's fucking jam this.
[27:28.58]I lost.
[27:29.16]Cam going off.
[27:30.06]Alright, what about on the other side?
[27:35.06]Over here.
[27:39.60]There's a window.
[27:43.07]Ah, they can shoot through windows.
[27:44.77]Oh, sin!
[27:45.23]Somebody's there.
[27:46.19]Nah, I gotta get these two.
[27:48.41]Hit the guy with the door when he comes out.
[27:50.95]Take his gun.
[27:51.71]He's slow to kill with melee.
[27:59.18]Lethal throws, though.
[28:00.04]I gotta remember that.
[28:00.82]Lethal throws.
[28:01.68]Lethal throws.
[28:03.24]Whoa!
[28:04.28]Fucking window.
[28:17.01]Actually, fuck it.
[28:22.29]Alright.
[28:22.77]What about the window?
[28:23.35]I can see right through the window, right?
[28:30.04]There's one guy up here.
[28:30.96]Guy through the window.
[28:31.77]I'm gonna get the guy through his own window.
[28:32.95]Like that.
[28:37.25]One more bullet for the guy in here with the gun.
[28:38.95]Watch this.
[28:39.37]Ready?
[28:39.59]Three, two, one, action.
[28:41.09]Oh!
[28:41.45]Okay, I'm fine.
[28:43.30]Ah!
[28:43.50]Ha!
[28:43.78]Ha!
[28:44.02]Ha!
[28:44.60]Oh, my fucking keys!
[28:45.86]I hit the caps lock.
[29:05.37]Watch out for the guy over here.
[29:06.25]Yeah, I had the same idea, dickhead.
[29:12.85]Alright, guy through the window.
[29:17.86]That's not a lethal throw.
[29:18.86]I hit the door.
[29:19.70]Okay, that's fine.
[29:24.92]Is there another guy in this?
[29:26.38]Right here.
[29:26.70]Ah, that didn't go through.
[29:30.04]Fuck, it's empty now.
[29:30.84]He's coming for me.
[29:31.30]He's coming for me.
[29:33.28]No, pick up the... Oh, fuck.
[29:40.43]I want that gun on the ground right there.
[29:42.13]Get... Get it!
[29:44.81]Okay, I got it.
[29:45.31]Okay, who do we got for guns?
[29:48.93]I don't think there's anybody left with a gun.
[29:53.46]There's only... The guy up there with a gun, there's a window.
[29:56.04]So we're gonna have to go... We're gonna have to snipe somebody.
[29:59.72]This guy right here.
[30:00.50]Let's see if I can get him.
[30:01.74]Okay, got that guy.
[30:03.38]Did I pull anybody else?
[30:08.82]I'm so paranoid for this guy right here.
[30:20.01]Dammit.
[30:20.39]I wasn't even trying to shoot you.
[30:21.31]I was trying to shoot him.
[30:23.39]Oh, that guy has a gun.
[30:24.21]Alright, I'm going the other way.
[30:32.41]Didn't get a double, but that's fine.
[30:33.47]Where's he going?
[30:34.02]All the way around?
[30:42.73]Put one cam on each corner of the screen.
[30:45.57]No, I can't do that.
[30:46.69]Alright, there's only one more guy up here with a gun.
[30:55.49]I'm gonna get sniped by somebody else and I'm gonna be so angry about it.
[31:01.90]Holy fuck, that was so panic-inducing.
[31:03.80]I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
[31:04.82]Alright, anything else in here?
[31:08.10]Give me a fresh gun.
[31:17.32]New floor.
[31:18.49]Nothing else I can grab.
[31:19.33]People are gonna get so angry with me.
[31:24.27]Dude, you missed the mask!
[31:25.25]Go get the mask, dude!
[31:26.25]Did I really hit the plant right there?
[31:28.91]What do we got?
[31:30.07]A guy with a gun.
[31:49.45]Watch out for the guy.
[31:49.93]You can see through the glass.
[31:53.25]Ah, and I didn't get shot.
[31:54.13]Holy fuck, how?
[31:55.88]Holy fuck, I'm being so stupid right now.
[31:57.44]Okay, stop, stop.
[31:58.24]Cool down.
[31:58.60]This guy right through the glass.
[32:02.66]You stupid idiot!
[32:19.62]Damn it.
[32:20.02]Now I'm going too fast.
[32:21.28]I gotta slow down.
[32:21.96]Fuck.
[32:28.89]I had it.
[32:29.25]I had it too.
[32:30.07]I had it.
[32:30.61]I had it.
[32:31.09]I think I got two people there.
[32:42.52]Holy fuck.
[32:50.23]Let me get a closer look.
[32:51.05]There's nobody with a gun in there.
[32:52.47]There's a guy with a gun up there.
[32:53.37]What happened?
[32:56.41]Why did I just spin around like that?
[32:57.89]That was wild.
[32:58.67]The guy, there's a guy.
[33:01.82]What was that?
[33:02.22]Why did I just like spin fucking around like 180 degrees?
[33:14.34]It turned my aimbot on for some reason.
[33:17.82]I'm not using one of those.
[33:23.89]That fucking glass right here.
[33:25.15]Alright, one guy here.
[33:28.05]Sorry, he's gonna come all the way around, and I'm gonna throw it at him.
[33:31.04]What happened?
[33:31.44]Is he dead?
[33:32.28]Is that a lethal throw?
[33:34.84]What the fuck did I do?
[33:36.12]Oh my god, what did I do?
[33:37.88]Oh my fucking god, what the hell?
[33:41.80]It just... Does every throw kill?
[33:43.90]Alright, I'm sorry, I have to turn the music down.
[33:47.45]It's so loud in my ear, and it's fucking my brain.
[34:01.63]Alright, here we go.
[34:06.15]It's the... I shouldn't... Don't even lock onto somebody.
[34:10.74]He's gonna come through.
[34:11.48]Shoot him.
[34:13.28]My goodness, Jeremy.
[34:17.16]Get good.
[34:18.82]Get good.
[34:19.22]You know what I mean?
[34:25.49]That's what people say nowadays.
[34:26.53]They go... No, hold on.
[34:28.63]It's better than that.
[34:29.11]They go... I can't do it.
[34:31.37]I drank too much fucking tea.
[34:32.75]My throat is all closed up.
[34:34.74]That means you're allergic to tea.
[34:38.56]I don't know what I'm talking about.
[34:54.71]Okay, that guy's a gun.
[34:56.67]How safe am I here?
[34:58.86]This is only Revel 2!
[34:59.88]This is only Revel da-da-da-da-deware!
[35:03.84]Right?
[35:04.06]Somebody laugh at that.
[35:04.62]Wasn't that funny?
[35:08.79]Fuck.
[35:08.97]Alright, there's only one more guy up there.
[35:25.11]Yeah, remember that, like, funny video?
[35:28.08]That, like, cute video.
[35:29.62]Okay.
[35:45.32]I don't have a fucking gun.
[35:46.86]Oh, what do I do about this?
[35:47.82]What do I do?
[35:53.50]I'm fine, okay.
[35:57.04]Lethal throws.
[36:00.24]Got it.
[36:01.02]Okay, we're good.
[36:03.39]That was a real life reaction.
[36:05.07]Yeah, dude, if somebody is chasing you with a knife, stabbing forward at you, you're gonna go, oh, dude, what the fuck do I do?
[36:12.95]That was a real reaction.
[36:16.93]Is that it?
[36:19.57]Can I throw the briefcase at him?
[36:23.11]This fucking boomer using auto-lock.
[36:27.49]I was told to use that.
[36:30.17]Somebody said, use auto-lock, it helps sometimes.
[36:32.83]I don't use it all the time.
[36:36.08]There you go, that's the C plus content you signed up for.
[36:40.82]Now, okay, like a 1 out of 10 stream is if somebody has a black screen and they were just sleeping, right?
[36:45.46]2 out of 10 stream is if somebody is streaming themselves sleeping with the camera on.
[36:52.88]3 out of 10 stream is building a birdhouse.
[36:54.24]4 out of 10 stream is playing Hotline Miami with Autoload.
[37:01.86]Just wait till you fucking see a 5 out of 10 stream.
[37:04.14]You're not even going to know it hit you.
[37:07.72]I just went back up.
[37:22.36]How am I lo- Oh, no, it's out here.
[37:30.02]Alright, it's gonna be more than a C+.
[37:33.70]If that's the case, this is a 7 out of 10 stream.
[37:36.37]Oh, no, that's a 7 out of 10 stream.
[37:37.73]Or a 69 out of 10.
[37:38.25]71.
[37:38.39]Got a new mask.
[37:38.87]Irvine.
[37:51.19]20 face cams are right.
[37:52.05]I will crash my computer.
[37:57.71]Hi there, welcome.
[37:58.21]What can I help you with?
[37:59.53]I'd like to get a tattoo.
[38:03.13]Right, you got anything particular in mind?
[38:04.73]Alright, so every time I see this guy's face, I keep imagining, I keep seeing like a hippopotamus mouth.
[38:17.28]Like, where his chin is, that's the top of the hippopotamus' mouth.
[38:20.48]And there's a big bottom half that's underneath that.
[38:25.62]I want old Dixie right here.
[38:27.08]Okay, sure, let me see.
[38:28.34]Right, how does this... Friday sound.
[38:31.60]That's what you look like.
[38:34.55]I don't look like this.
[38:38.05]Friday, what do you mean?
[38:38.87]You can't do it now?
[38:39.61]It has to be today.
[38:40.59]It's a special occasion today.
[38:42.85]I'm celebrating.
[38:44.31]Sorry, boss can't help you.
[38:45.23]We're all booked for days.
[38:48.05]Does that so?
[38:48.61]What kind of business are you running here?
[38:50.53]You just lost yourself a customer, you Russian asshole.
[38:54.11]Whatever you say, boss.
[39:03.14]Yeah, just you guys wait.
[39:04.94]Just you guys wait for the Bionic Boomer stream.
[39:10.10]It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[39:11.76]I'd like to welcome our next guest on the show.
[39:14.20]Famous from critically acclaimed movies such as...
[39:17.20]Blue Ocean, The Calm, and Land of Trees.
[39:19.92]Here's Martin Brown.
[39:21.74]Hi Martin, how are you?
[39:22.67]I'm good.
[39:26.15]Now your latest film is a bit of a step in a new direction for you.
[39:28.79]A lot of people are surprised by this.
[39:30.75]Some are even calling you a sellout.
[39:34.21]Bionic Boomer Tonight or Riot.
[39:37.41]Do you understand that I... I can't get keyboard pants.
[39:42.84]and like laser eye tracking devices that this is gonna take like a couple of weeks to put together.
[39:53.28]A lot of people are surprised by this, so we're calling you a sellout.
[39:56.20]What's your response to that?
[39:57.18]A sellout, huh?
[39:59.34]How do you mean?
[39:59.90]Well, some are saying that Midnight Animal is just another slasher flick.
[40:05.66]That's not how I see it.
[40:08.29]I have wanted to do this for a long time.
[40:11.41]Kill kids.
[40:13.35]Strangle them.
[40:14.85]Beat people's heads in.
[40:17.83]Rip their eyes out.
[40:18.81]Just listen to them str- Oh my god.
[40:21.27]What the fuck?
[40:22.95]I finally get to do that.
[40:24.29]Uh, okay.
[40:26.37]Don't look at me like that.
[40:28.31]What?
[40:29.23]I say this is a dream, right?
[40:32.39]What do you mean?
[40:33.43]All of this is just a dream, right?
[40:34.62]I'm not sure I follow.
[40:38.54]Okay, pause.
[40:43.96]You think this is a dream?
[40:44.96]Well, then maybe it's time to wake up.
[40:47.90]Who are you?
[40:50.31]Who am I?
[40:50.87]I'm not the one being interviewed here, am I?
[40:54.51]I think I should be the one asking the questions.
[40:58.78]This movie you're making, you know how it ends.
[41:02.42]I believe there's a pretty big twist at the end.
[41:04.44]I doubt you'll like it.
[41:06.95]In fact, I don't think anyone will.
[41:08.93]Maybe you ought to get out before it's too late.
[41:11.55]I don't think so.
[41:12.91]You really enjoy hurting other people, don't you?
[41:15.77]It's just a film.
[41:17.51]Just a film, huh?
[41:18.47]That's one way to look at it.
[41:19.61]Oh, and then, right after that, Batman and Superman are like shitting in a stall together.
[41:27.35]And like, you can hear the loud fart poop noises.
[41:39.50]Nobody knows what I was doing there?
[41:44.56]What are you talking about?
[41:45.24]That's... Well, I must be out of touch.
[41:49.01]That was a robot chicken segment, and we moved to another one.
[41:51.55]Like, don't... What are you talking about?
[42:03.11]Don't you remember, like, robot chicken?
[42:04.21]It would do, like, the... And change to, like, superheroes that are really cool, but they just, like...
[42:09.70]fart at each other, and like... Get... just get it, right?
[42:17.92]Does anybody get it?
[42:20.04]You generally aren't in your head.
[42:21.78]Are you sure?
[42:28.66]Uh, looks like the police is here.
[42:31.28]The girl must have told on you.
[42:33.18]You better go along obediently, they'll take you to her.
[42:35.70]What's that you want?
[42:36.78]Well, that's what you want, isn't it?
[42:38.02]Click.
[42:43.56]Hold it right there.
[42:46.26]Why am I wearing this mask?
[42:47.82]We're here to arrest you, you need to come with us.
[42:49.72]We'll take you down to the station.
[42:52.63]Do you understand what I'm saying?
[42:55.25]Apparently not.
[42:58.89]You can't tell me that Robot Chicken is a boomer show.
[43:02.86]That, that was, that's like still on the air.
[43:06.02]And if it's not, it was off the air like five years ago.
[43:10.75]You know what you've been up to and you're gonna fry for it.
[43:12.53]The girls upstairs giving us their full statement right now.
[43:16.29]Soon they'll be on their way down here for you.
[43:18.49]Until then, you're stuck with me.
[43:22.07]The fuck?
[43:22.63]I'd like to ask, but why did you do what you did?
[43:26.19]Do you even know?
[43:26.89]You don't even know yourself.
[43:28.45]Do you?
[43:28.69]What?
[43:28.91]Can the phone fucking... Somebody pick up the phone?
[43:31.37]Look at me.
[43:31.99]You're fucked.
[43:34.81]Completely fucked to the head.
[43:36.73]Aren't you?
[43:37.83]Why else would anyone be killing kids in a pig's mask, huh?
[43:40.83]Oh my fucking god!
[43:44.16]It's the phone.
[43:45.14]You should answer it.
[43:46.54]I'll say it again.
[43:47.16]There is no phone.
[43:48.36]I don't see no phone, and I don't hear no phone, okay?
[43:51.50]It's just a figment of your imagination, you hear me?
[43:54.16]You're insane.
[43:55.12]A maniac.
[43:55.87]And soon enough, you will pay for your crimes.
[43:59.09]The telephone.
[43:59.93]You're not gonna answer?
[44:03.53]There's just no point talking to you, is there?
[44:10.69]What the fuck?
[44:12.17]You know it needs to be done.
[44:13.11]It's not like you're looking.
[44:13.93]It's like he wants you to click.
[44:21.54]Do I have... Is this the... What the fuck is this game?
[44:29.14]The last game was like answering phone calls.
[44:31.96]And...
[44:33.65]Like, fighting people!
[44:36.61]Why do I have to be this, like, creepy guy?
[44:38.69]And, like, break... Anything else?
[44:54.04]This one has a strange, elaborate story.
[44:58.54]Whoa, I could break the toilet.
[45:01.69]I know it was a TV, you know what I'm saying.
[45:04.56]You guys are like inside my head, you know what I mean by that.
[45:06.56]Oi!
[45:15.17]Get off of him!
[45:15.73]What are you doing?

[45:28.28]I'm not gonna shoot any weapons.
[45:29.56]I'm not gonna shoot a gun.
[45:30.48]Let me just see if I can do this without... You guys coming around here?
[45:34.50]Am I safe?
[45:38.20]Oh, not safe!
[45:38.86]Not safe!
[45:40.16]Oh, damn it.
[45:46.95]I would've had it, potentially, too, there.
[45:49.15]Fuck, what am I doing?
[45:50.57]What about up there?
[45:51.13]I'm gonna try going... No.
[45:53.15]I'm gonna wait for this patrol to go by, and I'm gonna go out.
[46:00.40]actually no no no no no no I got a better idea never mind yeah he's shot right in the face it was a decent idea and it still is I'm gonna try it again
[46:25.36]Give me a fucking break.
[46:26.48]How did the... You don't even notice that you... How do you not notice this?
[46:42.72]What the fuck?
[46:43.32]How did you not notice that?
[46:47.36]Why do you have the intelligence of the orcs from Shadow of Mordor?
[46:50.74]Come on.
[47:09.49]Where the fuck did you guys even come from?!
[47:15.34]I'm gonna do that.
[47:15.84]Shit, I'm gonna throw it at him and then I'm gonna sit in this room.
[47:31.31]Okay, give me the gun.
[47:33.11]I have items in here now.
[47:35.17]Now it's just a question of trying to get this done.
[47:37.03]Okay, so now I can get- I should be able to cleanly kill this guy right here without a problem, right?
[47:45.28]One, two, three, go.
[47:52.32]Guy in this room, I'm gonna get him.
[47:58.93]Holy fuck you!
[48:03.38]Okay.
[48:04.12]Calm down.
[48:06.82]These patrols are gonna... I'm gonna forget about them.
[48:13.04]What about over there?
[48:13.78]Yeah, there's a guy that way.
[48:16.90]These guys don't have guns, though.
[48:20.40]Oh, shit.
[48:29.15]No!
[48:29.95]God damn it!
[48:33.60]God damn it!
[48:34.96]Oh, come on, man.
[48:36.06]What the hell was I doing there?
[48:52.22]Alright.

[49:01.94]Oh, you fucking door.
[49:04.36]Oh, you fucking door.
[49:05.50]Is that guy alive?
[49:09.68]Let's just give them a wall.
[49:14.78]I hate, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.
[49:16.70]I can't believe it.
[49:17.54]God damn it.
[49:18.28]This level is really fucking hard.
[49:21.46]Ugh.
[49:24.03]Come on, man.
[49:25.63]I had it right there too.
[49:28.87]This shit was done.
[49:29.77]Ugh.
[49:43.32]How did he not throw it?
[49:44.80]Holy shit, this is insane.
[49:50.37]Alright.
[49:51.19]Get the sweaty fucking hand syndrome out of here.
[50:02.74]Just wipe my fucking hand.
[50:04.12]I'm like covered in water.
[50:05.16]13 bullets.
[50:16.09]Okay.
[50:16.91]Good.
[50:18.93]I think I did it.
[50:19.45]Okay, just... I'm gonna keep the pistol.
[50:23.59]Just be very careful here.
[50:25.33]There's no reason to freak out.
[50:26.49]I'm gonna wait till they turn around.
[50:27.61]There's only three guys left.
[50:29.03]Four.
[50:29.94]That guy doesn't have a gun.
[50:31.86]Nine bullets.
[50:34.28]That was a monster energy spread.
[50:37.68]I don't even know what that means, but I guess I'll agree with you.
[50:40.38]There he is.
[50:41.00]Right here.
[50:49.19]One, two, three.
[50:51.09]Where's the patrol?
[50:52.53]They're up there.
[50:53.01]That's a monster enemy!
[50:57.64]Stop distracting me!
[51:01.90]Oh my lord!
[51:02.64]I almost lost it right there!
[51:03.62]I almost just lost it and I thought I did and I didn't.
[51:05.54]I just barely got it.
[51:06.74]Oh man, okay.
[51:11.40]Anybody else have a gun?
[51:12.60]These two guys don't have guns.
[51:20.12]Only one guy has a gun in there, but he does have one.
[51:35.41]No, two guys with guns.
[51:36.47]Guy with a gun here.
[51:37.25]Okay, let's go for it.
[51:40.03]Nobody up or down, right?
[51:41.11]No one's gonna snipe me.
[51:48.12]Give me your gun.
[52:01.63]Just go?
[52:02.39]What do you mean, just go?
[52:04.31]Stay in here and you'll be safe.
[52:05.45]I'm gonna go see what's going on.
[52:07.19]Don't open the door until I get back, no matter what.
[52:11.83]Just go.
[52:12.82]That's easier said than... Oh, the fucking window.
[52:16.68]I didn't even know there was a window here.
[52:21.38]I didn't know those things.
[52:24.55]How did I not shoot the guy with the gun?
[52:40.82]What's this guy?
[52:43.86]Why is Death Eater here?
[52:45.42]No, Reaper.
[52:46.06]Why is Reaper from Overwatch?
[52:51.11]Death Eater?
[52:52.49]Whatever his name is.
[52:54.79]Reaper!
[52:57.81]I am terrified to go over here.
[53:00.53]This only has one bullet.
[53:13.32]Alright, where's Reaper?
[53:16.29]There he is.
[53:20.46]Oh, fuck you.
[53:21.38]Oh my god, is he dead?
[53:22.58]He's dead, right?
[53:23.38]Is he?
[53:24.04]He's not dead!
[53:24.62]Is he dead now?
[53:25.42]He's not dead now.
[53:26.04]I just ripped his head off.
[53:32.63]Okay, got it.
[53:33.17]I can't take his guns?
[53:37.05]Okay.
[53:50.69]Oh, oh, wait a minute!
[53:51.79]Oh, no!
[53:53.67]Oh, fuck!
[53:55.87]No, goddammit!
[54:04.38]Dammit!
[54:05.04]I'm gonna have to fight Reaper again.
[54:08.60]I think that's the only way you can kill him.
[54:18.45]You have to rip his head off.
[54:25.55]Alright.
[54:26.63]This time, I'm not gonna just run over there.
[54:28.45]There's... One, two... Anybody down there?
[54:31.37]I think there is.
[54:31.87]I can't see that far.
[54:37.36]There's a guy right there with a gun.
[54:42.18]Oh no.
[54:42.78]Is he running up here?
[54:43.34]I don't know which way he's gonna go.
[54:45.30]I'm hiding.
[54:59.26]I don't have any guns.
[54:59.86]I don't have any guns.
[55:00.42]Guns, guns.
[55:00.82]Give me a gun.
[55:06.66]Like, pull him into the bathroom?
[55:11.42]He has a shotgun, but I gotta get into this room, I think.
[55:14.06]Is there anybody else in that room?
[55:15.49]No, there's not.
[55:21.77]It's... It's... It's up this windows.
[55:25.71]Oh my goodness.
[55:27.25]Why can I not go over there?
[55:41.89]What kind of aim do you have?
[55:43.48]What kind of aim do you have?
[55:45.64]What kind of aim was that?
[55:48.28]You shot it... I locked onto him and it shot to the left and it shot to the right of him.
[55:52.90]What is the aim that I... What kind of aim is that?
[56:02.45]Oh, fuck!
[56:14.38]This is bad.
[56:17.86]Maybe not.
[56:20.64]No, I need... Give me the gun!
[56:25.78]Holy fuck you.
[56:29.13]What do I do about Reaper?
[56:30.59]I can't believe it.
[56:33.39]I had it too and it was done and I just didn't get it done.
[56:36.65]Is that the bullshit shitty aim thing?
[56:43.08]Alright, get over here Reaper.
[56:47.56]Come on.
[56:52.53]Why is it always holy?
[56:53.71]What do you mean holy?
[56:57.66]There's nobody else over here.
[56:58.61]I'm gonna shoot Reaper, break his neck.
[57:01.73]Sorry, my throat.
[57:03.49]I wish I could take his guns, honest to God.
[57:11.14]Okay.
[57:12.34]Do it again.
[57:12.82]Maybe I should just go that way.
[57:21.80]What is that way?
[57:26.46]I can't believe it didn't hit.
[57:29.39]No, no, no, I'll be fine, I'll be fine.
[57:35.54]Oh my fucking god, Jeremy.
[57:38.06]How did I get stuck in the wall?
[57:51.73]Who the fuck is that guy?
[57:53.11]Okay, yeah, I needed two shots to kill, like, the, whatever that guy was.
[57:59.67]You stupid game!
[58:00.95]No fucking way!
[58:02.31]No way!
[58:03.89]No way!
[58:05.30]There's no way.
[58:06.80]I don't believe it.
[58:08.26]I don't even believe it was possible. ...
[58:23.05]That's impossible!
[58:26.83]Yes, I'm doing the movie villain thing at the end of the movie, but it really is.
[58:30.71]I understand the villain now.
[58:31.87]I know what he's saying, how it's not possible.
[58:38.25]God damn it.
[58:41.05]Why did that have to happen?
[58:42.93]He just like instantly fucking 180 pixel turned on me.
[58:48.81]Give me a break.
[58:58.51]I got stuck on the fucking wall.
[59:36.12]I wish it would prioritize guns that have ammo in them.
[59:39.91]How do I check that box?
[59:50.72]Get in this room.
[59:57.54]room to room guy over there they both have guns I have four shots did I get them both I did not get them both okay now
[60:24.25]I didn't, my brain wasn't prepared for a guy to come around the corner like that.
[60:28.01]Oh my god.
[60:31.11]Why?
[60:31.53]It was over.
[60:34.23]It was fucking over!
[60:35.57]It was done.
[60:52.21]This guy right here.
[60:54.09]I won't get to walk across the whole map.
[60:55.71]Did I hear a gunfire?
[60:58.05]Have I heard gunfire the entire game?
[61:00.53]The whole floor?
[61:02.44]I'll go out on this 600th shot this time.
[61:04.78]I think I heard something.
[61:21.34]I broke the bike.
[61:26.53]I'm gonna get it this time.
[61:27.61]I'm gonna be prepared for a guy on the left.
[61:38.56]Got them both.
[61:39.54]I did.
[61:40.04]Okay.
[61:40.88]Wait a minute.
[61:41.30]Wait.
[61:42.80]No, he's not here.
[61:47.16]Wait a minute.
[61:48.26]Wait a minute.
[61:51.07]I only have two bullets, though.
[61:52.23]I need a different gun.
[61:54.63]Does any... I only have... I gotta get the guns that these guys dropped.
[61:57.63]Okay.
[62:01.03]I turn into like Vince McMahon sometimes.
[62:03.45]Like I'm casting a wrestling event.
[62:10.52]Anybody hear that?
[62:12.28]Did anybody hear that?
[62:13.52]Is what I need to know.
[62:19.49]I only have two bullets.
[62:20.71]I have to make it count.
[62:29.99]Pick up the gun before I do something where I scream!
[62:34.60]Okay.
[62:36.26]I think I got it.
[62:37.86]That one last guy, I'm not fucking around.
[62:41.57]I'm going to go all the way around, because he can shoot me through the glass.
[62:43.93]Because there is glass down here.
[62:48.47]Don't shoot me through the glass.
[62:49.57]I want to shoot you through the glass.
[62:53.01]Okay, get the keys.
[62:59.57]Can't go in here?
[63:05.04]Who has the key?
[63:12.38]Oh, reaper does.
[63:13.28]I'm not your fucking girlfriend.
[63:38.67]Wait, what happened?
[63:39.43]I have to re- Wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[63:41.73]What?
[63:42.73]What?
[63:43.23]What?
[63:44.77]Okay, I was about to fucking freak out.
[63:48.75]Cut.
[63:48.97]No need for a retake.
[63:49.69]That was perfect.
[63:51.89]This is a movie.
[63:53.37]Good job, guys.
[63:53.99]Spectacular performances.
[63:54.95]So this is the movie that the guy was talking about.
[63:56.71]I only got a few more shots to shoot before we can move on to editing.
[64:04.83]Why don't you go grab something to eat while we put in the new set piece?
[64:09.84]Make sure you're back in 30 minutes, okay?
[64:11.12]Time is money.
[64:12.51]You heard him, Martin.
[64:13.59]Time to get up.
[64:15.75]Martin.
[64:21.39]You spent all that time in rage on a movie.
[64:27.47]71,000 is the total.
[64:29.21]That's a pretty good score so far.
[64:33.19]I got a better than an A. I got 110 points.
[64:35.81]I got extra credit.
[64:38.52]I remembered what the teacher's favorite candy was, because that was the extra credit question.
[64:44.05]Good thing I got it.
[64:46.43]I would have had a, probably a C-.
[64:52.90]Second act, Rising.
[64:53.96]1991, Miami, Florida.
[65:03.93]Now, the defendant claims that he was ordered to commit these murders through messages left on his answering machine.
[65:10.29]Did you investigate these claims?
[65:12.83]Yes, we did.
[65:14.27]And what did you find?
[65:16.05]Well, the defendant's answering machine was empty.
[65:18.11]The tape had been removed.
[65:20.39]Did you find anything supporting these claims of threatening phone calls?
[65:24.57]No, sir, we did not.
[65:28.05]I see.
[65:28.67]No further questions.
[65:31.05]You say you found no physical evidence supporting my client's claims.
[65:33.85]Then what about phone records?
[65:35.35]Surely the police would have no difficulty accessing such information.
[65:40.13]Indeed, we did investigate the defendant's phone records.
[65:43.91]And did you find any calls on record that could support my client's claims?
[65:48.93]We did, sir.
[65:50.71]The defendant seems to have received phone calls.
[65:58.53]that match the time frame which he suggests, but did you manage to trace these calls?
[66:04.09]If so, where did they come from?
[66:08.00]We traced the calls to a nightclub called the Golden Truck Stop, yes.
[66:13.40]Now my client claims that he was coerced by the Russian Mafia to commit the crimes for which he was now being prosecuted.
[66:20.14]Did the police have any knowledge of ties between the Golden Truck Stop and the Russian Mafia that could support my client's claims?
[66:27.35]The venue has been linked to several mob-related crimes in the past, yes.
[66:30.63]However, that would be all.
[66:32.23]Thank you.
[66:32.55]No further questions.
[66:35.56]The witness may step down.
[66:36.76]The court will now be adjourned.
[66:39.36]Proceedings will continue tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[66:41.42]Meanwhile, the defendant will remain in police custody.
[66:44.48]Who's that?
[66:48.12]I think that's supposed to be me.
[66:56.72]Food in the trash?
[66:57.38]No.
[67:00.39]Time to make a phone call.
[67:02.87]Leave a message on somebody's machine.
[67:04.63]You've reached the Miami Police Department.
[67:06.25]How may I help you?
[67:08.09]I'd like to talk to Detective Pardo.
[67:10.24]Tell him it's from Evan.
[67:12.32]One moment, please.
[67:13.16]Click.
[67:14.00]What do you want, Evan?
[67:14.64]I'm in the middle of something here.
[67:17.20]Look, I'm really busy here.
[67:18.84]1-800-HIGH-SCHOOL-MUSICAL.
[67:42.63]Don't be like that now, you owe me one, remember?
[67:46.13]Fine, go to Northwest 37th Avenue, ask for Petrov and tell him I sent you.
[67:51.77]Can't promise he'll talk, but it's the only name I've got.
[67:54.15]Don't call me at work again, okay?
[67:55.39]No more favors.
[67:58.39]Okay.
[68:08.99]Why is this just the courtroom from Chrono Trigger?
[68:13.42]When you get tried.
[68:14.12]These are the same models.
[68:27.00]Alright, let's go.
[68:29.93]Okay.
[68:33.23]Why is everybody holding a boombox?
[68:39.83]Are these the guys playing the music?

[69:23.98]Okay.
[69:29.90]What the fuck was that?
[69:30.62]Am I bringing him back to life?
[69:33.18]Hold on, I killed him, and now I'm bringing him back to life.
[69:40.50]What?
[69:43.36]What the fuck was that, Jeremy?
[69:44.94]It was the fucking Joker.
[69:47.77]Help!
[69:47.91]Somebody call an ambulance!
[69:48.67]It's been an accident!
[69:49.95]Is there anyone here?
[70:02.26]Pick up the gun!
[70:03.02]What are you doing?
[70:03.84]Why can I not pick the gun up?
[70:07.83]What?
[70:08.83]Am I like non-violent?
[70:18.41]Oh, shit.
[70:19.11]Okay, I gotta go.
[70:25.37]Oh, you idiot!
[70:27.73]You idiot!
[70:31.99]Idiot!
[70:40.21]What about the guys with the guns?
[70:48.50]Oh, you idiot!
[71:00.77]I get it.
[71:01.07]I get it.
[71:01.63]I get it.
[71:01.97]I get it.
[71:02.39]Okay, I get it.
[71:02.93]I'm disarming the guns.
[71:03.69]I get it.
[71:03.99]I understand it now.
[71:04.83]So they can't use them.
[71:05.69]I get it.
[71:22.60]Where's that guy with the fucking gun right there?
[71:32.37]Oh, you idiot!
[71:42.59]Oh shit, he got up!
[71:48.86]Oh fuck, okay, get it!
[71:49.90]Go get the gun!
[72:16.15]And excuse me, all of you watching at home, I'd like to know what killed me behind the corner.
[72:24.15]I'd like to have an explanation as to who did it.
[72:32.24]Oh, that guy.
[72:32.92]Okay, thanks for the explanation.
[72:41.22]Okay, that's actually pretty good.
[72:42.45]I'd rather go... Is this guy fight?
[72:54.32]Is this guy gonna attack me?
[72:55.54]Okay, so after they get knocked down, they don't care anymore.
[72:58.37]Is that what I'm understanding?
[73:06.33]Alright.
[73:07.29]Okay.
[73:08.82]And I clearly, very clearly, I punched him.
[73:12.52]I did.
[73:12.76]I'm punching him.
[73:14.44]He's being punched.
[73:15.84]That's all I wanted.
[73:38.23]Fuck.
[73:38.81]Oh my god.
[73:39.53]Oh my god, now that they all see me.
[73:47.61]Okay, is there anybody?
[73:48.42]I can't tell.
[73:52.88]I need to get that gun.
[73:57.58]I need that back.
[73:59.12]I need that fucking thing back.
[74:08.03]Nobody else, right?
[74:08.81]Nobody else?
[74:09.45]Nobody else?
[74:12.91]I didn't do it right.
[74:15.74]I didn't do it right.
[74:17.54]I didn't do it right.
[74:24.70]I didn't do it right.
[74:27.83]You can knock them out with spacebar?
[74:29.31]What are you talking about?
[74:30.03]Isn't that what I'm doing?
[74:41.82]Okay, see that's why I didn't do it, because it takes fucking forever to do that.
[75:08.56]I'd love to know what world that was in.
[75:11.07]What fucking world are we living in where that doesn't kill him?
[75:14.29]Okay, put this down here.
[75:15.65]Disarm.
[75:18.11]Disarm it.
[75:19.13]I can't disarm that.
[75:19.87]Okay, well, I don't even need to.
[75:21.37]Alright, I'm gonna get this motherfucker right now.
[75:44.28]And I threw the fucking thing.
[75:45.58]I just want to put it down.
[75:46.92]I just wanted to place it below me.
[75:49.41]Did I have to throw it?
[75:51.37]I just whipped it across the game!
[75:53.19]I'm gonna go around.
[76:11.78]Ah!
[76:21.41]Too long, too long, too long.
[76:22.56]That takes too long.
[76:23.46]Okay, I got it.
[76:24.96]Don't fuck this up.
[76:30.40]It's an easy throw.
[76:35.51]Okay, I'm good.
[76:43.07]Now the knife.
[76:43.89]Holy shit, I didn't even see him.
[76:45.36]Okay.
[76:50.17]Guy with a gun.
[76:50.87]Anybody else around the corner?
[76:52.07]I'm fucking paranoid.
[76:53.11]Hold on.
[76:53.35]Let me go this way.
[76:57.38]I don't know.
[76:57.72]Is there a guy with a gun up here?
[77:00.16]No, there's not.
[77:00.70]Okay.
[77:01.20]Wrap around.
[77:02.54]I just want to see.
[77:03.26]There is a kid.
[77:03.84]There are more people up here.
[77:07.52]I'm going to go the other way.
[77:14.25]I'm going to throw it at this guy.
[77:15.57]I got it.
[77:17.49]I got it.
[77:17.85]But the other guys have guns too.
[77:20.83]What do I do about that?
[77:23.00]I think I have to go the other way.
[77:24.38]Ugh.
[77:25.38]No I don't.
[77:25.74]Here he comes.
[77:33.14]Oh fuck.
[77:34.54]Anything else over... Okay, I disarmed the gun.
[77:39.77]Just two guys with melee and a guy with a gun.
[77:45.33]Just wait till he stands up.
[77:45.99]I'm not taking the time to do the animation.
[77:51.45]How far up is he?
[77:51.99]All the way up, right?
[77:59.89]That's good, right?
[78:00.43]He's done?
[78:01.05]Spacebar's not doing anything.
[78:02.21]One guy left.
[78:03.04]I have to sneak up behind him and throw this in the back of his head.
[78:08.68]Holy fuck, he turned around really quickly!
[78:10.74]Okay, thank god.
[78:16.98]There's more of this shit.
[78:18.82]There's more of this shit!
[78:30.68]I can't hit him through the window.
[78:31.88]Alright, disarm.
[78:39.07]Who's left?
[78:39.61]Two more guys.
[78:40.41]Oh, fuck.
[78:41.11]Not through the window.
[78:41.73]Not through the window.
[78:42.29]Don't get me through the window.
[78:45.49]Disarm their guns.
[78:50.53]This is too... Oh, that guy can see me through the window.
[78:53.43]Oh, Kenny?
[78:56.37]Is anybody below?
[78:57.31]If I go over there, I... You know what I'm saying?
[78:59.05]If I do this...
[79:02.28]He can see me through the fucking window.
[79:03.72]Oh, fuck!
[79:16.43]Dude, do it, do it, get off of him.
[79:18.57]How do I get off this guy?
[79:20.15]How do I get off this guy?
[79:22.85]Oh, okay, I got it, I'm good.
[79:43.29]game is so stressful it's Tuesday how am I gonna get to this guy I have to throw it at him I have to throw it at him oh my bike I just like be fine okay I did it right
[80:13.79]What's left?
[80:17.19]Somebody down here?
[80:17.97]Are there windows down here?
[80:25.67]Okay, no windows, but I gotta make this good.
[80:27.86]Should I not be killing?
[80:34.64]I just threw him in the fucking bathtub.
[80:37.10]I need those.
[80:48.73]Who's this?
[80:51.71]Who the hell are you?
[80:53.19]Oh!
[80:53.41]Hey!
[80:53.77]There's a cutscene going on here!
[80:55.05]Uh... Do you mind if I... Um... Are you Petrov?
[80:59.82]I'm writing a book about the mask maniac.
[81:03.48]Detective Pardo told me I could talk to you about it.
[81:06.62]Detective Pardo told you that?
[81:07.72]A friend of yours?
[81:09.82]That's right, sir.
[81:13.63]Not a very good friend.
[81:14.49]I take it.
[81:14.77]I'm ready.
[81:15.05]I'm sending you here of all places.
[81:17.80]You know, I reckon you're right about that, sir.
[81:20.54]Okay, give me control back and I'm gonna get it.
[81:22.48]Guy in the... Hold on, I gotta look at it again.
[81:24.14]This book you're writing must be very important.
[81:25.92]Risking your life to come talk to me.
[81:27.24]Sure, you've got balls.
[81:28.96]What is it you want to know?
[81:29.96]You get two questions.
[81:31.22]Then you get the fuck out of here.
[81:33.88]Okay, I have to turn around.
[81:34.81]I gotta... A and S. Hold A and S. Swing around.
[81:38.09]Swing.
[81:39.47]Alright.
[81:40.05]The police claims the masked murderers were part of a vigilante movement.
[81:44.79]Are you of the same opinion?
[81:48.32]No.
[81:48.50]I don't think they were vigilantes.
[81:51.16]They were much too organized.
[81:53.24]They knew our exact locations and had insight into our inner workings.
[81:57.17]I don't know what they were a part of, but it was a group, no group of vigilantes.
[82:01.68]Why do you think they targeted the Russian mafia?
[82:03.99]What were they after?
[82:05.49]I can't tell you what they were after, but they effectively destroyed our whole organization, and then they were gone.
[82:12.01]They knew what they were doing, and they seemed to be trained very well.
[82:15.72]We caught a couple of them alive, tried to break them.
[82:18.64]None of them talked, not a single one.
[82:20.02]Alright, no more questions.
[82:21.40]Get the hell out of my sight.
[82:22.16]Here we go.
[82:22.94]Okay.
[82:25.84]What do I do about this?
[82:37.21]Okay, we're fine.
[82:40.79]Okay, we're good.
[82:50.56]Bad end.
[82:51.56]Bad end.
[82:52.26]Why is it the bad end?
[82:58.60]What do you mean, bad end?
[83:00.46]Actual maniac.
[83:05.67]You killed someone.
[83:08.49]I accidentally... because I was panic pressing the button.
[83:20.74]Don't listen to them.
[83:24.54]Don't listen to chat!
[83:29.60]Oh, well that's alright.
[83:32.14]Ooh, that's a D+.
[83:33.14]That's the first time I've had a D+.
[83:41.56]I've only had C's in the first game.
[83:44.76]And B's and A's.
[83:46.64]Still a passing grade?
[83:47.38]I'm okay.
[83:48.72]What a day.
[83:50.17]Did something happen?
[83:52.45]No?
[83:52.77]Well, yeah.
[83:54.21]That guy, Petrov, he wouldn't see me.
[83:56.29]Almost got beaten up just trying to get in.
[83:59.82]Hey, you actually went there or didn't figure you would.
[84:03.36]Man, sometimes I wonder why I hang out with you.
[84:05.66]When did you become such a douchebag?
[84:08.36]Well, I did tell you to write about the Miami mutilator instead, didn't I?
[84:13.62]A much more sophisticated case, really, and you wouldn't have to talk to the mob.
[84:17.71]People will have forgotten about those vigilantes by the time your book's out.
[84:23.15]I accidentally stomped a guy's head to the wall and blasted his brother's torso with a shotgun.
[84:32.90]Come on.
[84:33.58]Besides, I bought you a beer, right?
[84:35.56]And you didn't really get hurt, did you?
[84:37.32]Let's call it even.
[84:39.54]Thanks for the beer and all, but you still owe me one.
[84:42.87]Alright, alright.
[84:43.87]Don't forget I'm putting my job on the line.
[84:46.39]If anyone finds out I'm giving you leads, that'll be it for me.
[84:52.17]You'll be fired for incompetence or misconduct before that happens.
[84:55.19]I'm surprised they haven't fired you already.
[84:57.67]I'm tired.
[84:58.03]Let's get out of here.
[84:59.63]Yeah, I should get some sleep too.
[85:00.81]You want a ride?
[85:03.04]I'll take my chances on the bus.
[85:09.04]Wait.
[85:10.68]Who the fuck am I?
[85:11.63]Okay, I'm the different character now.
[85:21.97]Alright.
[85:24.35]Did you just try to kill him?
[85:25.45]I was not trying to kill him, I just pressed space on him.
[85:28.06]To see if there's extra dialogue sequences.
[85:32.53]December 2nd, 1991.
[85:33.97]So, we're going somewhere special tonight, eh?
[85:37.98]Yeah, my friend Jack told me about this place down on Northwest AA-184th Street.
[85:42.11]The real shithole.
[85:43.21]The whole building's occupied by junkies and lowlifes.
[85:46.03]Kinda like this place, huh?
[85:48.17]Uh, fuck you, Mark.
[85:49.95]Anyway, his sister's been hanging out with these assholes, hasn't been home for weeks, so he figured we'd get her home.
[85:55.92]And teach her friends a lesson.
[85:58.77]Wait, we're doing house calls for your friends now?
[86:01.25]Isn't that pretty much what we did last time?
[86:03.73]I didn't hear any complaints back then.
[86:05.90]We can't patrol the streets looking for scumbags.
[86:08.42]We'd be in jail in no time.
[86:10.52]Yeah, but I didn't sign up to be no hero rescuing women and shit.
[86:14.40]That's just not my thing.
[86:15.44]I just want some action.
[86:17.82]So you got any better ideas?
[86:19.20]Or should we just stay here and argue all night?
[86:22.06]I sure as hell ain't staying here.
[86:23.10]I'm ready to roll.
[86:23.88]Am I gonna get the quack mask?
[86:26.51]Fine, I'll come along.
[86:28.07]But if anything happens to the girl, it's not my problem.
[86:29.91]Got it.
[86:31.47]Sure.
[86:31.91]Okay.
[86:32.63]Whatever.
[86:32.97]Let's go.
[86:38.71]Slot machine?
[86:39.69]Nice.
[86:46.68]What is this fucked up, like, Ghostbusters mobile?
[86:51.58]Moving up.
[86:55.84]Okay.
[86:56.22]Roll dodge.
[86:58.84]Killing punches, no weapons.
[87:00.14]What is roll dodge?
[87:07.03]When did I have this?
[87:10.13]What the fuck?
[87:13.29]I guess I just didn't even know I had this.
[87:19.16]Rewind.
[87:21.80]Killing punches.
[87:22.54]I like this.
[87:35.73]Quickly, alright.
[87:36.97]Nice and easy.
[87:37.89]Left, right, look both ways before you cross the street.
[87:40.74]It's easy enough.
[87:42.80]I can't even pick up weapons.
[87:45.18]Okay, we got... Gun guy's gotta go first.
[87:48.01]That was pretty sloppy, but whatever.
[88:00.41]Guy with the gun, he's gotta go first, or I can bait the guy with the knife.
[88:03.23]Wowee.
[88:04.73]That was fucking close, okay.
[88:07.89]Lots of guys with guns.
[88:09.55]Might have to actually go the other way.
[88:10.78]Yeah, let's take these guys out first.
[88:26.39]Another door opening down here, okay, that's it.
[88:29.69]Alright, I can go through there.
[88:31.15]There's a hole in the wall, but there's also a guy with a gun.
[88:36.51]So.
[88:44.48]It's all about the bait.
[88:46.60]I could go down.
[88:47.42]I don't really want anybody to shoot in the middle here.
[88:49.26]That'll alert everybody.
[88:53.04]I'm thinking, I'm thinking straight through try to kill both of them in one punch.
[89:04.26]Or eight.
[89:05.14]That's fine.
[89:10.10]I see windows.
[89:10.91]No, I'm good.
[89:13.77]One guy.
[89:14.35]That guy almost blended in with the ground.
[89:15.83]I almost just ran in here and screamed.
[89:21.01]Alright, so far so good.
[89:27.32]This guy.
[89:27.70]I don't think this guy has a gun.
[89:30.74]It's just the two guys up there, and then one guy... No, that's it, right?
[89:34.08]Okay.
[89:34.50]Here we go.
[89:34.78]I'm just gonna ambush.
[89:37.78]Not yet.
[89:38.50]No.
[89:45.85]Anything in the toilet or anything?
[89:46.95]Nothing over here?
[89:47.49]I can't really go anywhere from here.
[89:48.41]Alright, ambush this guy.
[89:50.59]Don't look at me!
[89:51.09]Don't look at me!
[89:51.47]Don't look at me!
[89:52.73]Holy shit, that was almost very bad.
[89:54.61]Okay, only got two guys left.
[89:56.83]Three, actually.
[89:57.51]That's a mistake to call it two.
[90:07.13]No, no, no.
[90:12.27]Go back around.
[90:14.44]This has been so clean, I haven't died once.
[90:16.28]I'm not going to ruin this.
[90:19.66]I'm going to go back around down here.
[90:26.31]You actually can't pick up any weapons.
[90:32.95]Alright, here we go.
[90:36.76]Once this guy moves, oh no.
[90:46.73]I, fuck, where am I standing?
[90:48.17]Okay.
[91:04.62]Almost a disaster.
[91:06.55]Almost a fucking complete disaster.
[91:09.87]That's it, right?
[91:10.59]Only one more?
[91:14.91]Only one guy left down here in this room.
[91:21.85]Clean.
[91:23.00]As clean as it can be.
[91:32.08]Dogs.
[91:35.90]Does me punch- can I punch the dog once and kill it?
[91:46.21]Damn it.
[91:46.85]Okay.
[91:57.30]There's another guy with a gun down there, I thought.
[92:03.66]Is there?
[92:06.01]Oh, fuck, there was!
[92:07.07]Jeeeees!
[92:09.21]Jeez!
[92:10.70]Jeez, and a dog!
[92:11.68]Jeez!
[92:12.56]They're fast, right?
[92:13.22]They're very fast!
[92:15.60]I knew it was fast!
[92:16.90]I knew it was fast, too!
[92:18.14]And I just wasn't ready for it.
[92:19.56]My muscle... brain to computer memory.
[92:22.02]Where's the other guy?
[92:34.79]I know you're down there, you little asshole.
[92:36.29]Okay, dog.
[92:40.82]Get ready for it.
[92:48.82]Okay.
[92:49.26]You gotta be the aggressor.
[92:50.88]Right?
[92:51.06]You know what I mean?
[92:55.85]None of these guys have guns.
[92:57.47]This should be fairly simple.
[92:59.25]Holy shit!
[93:01.23]He had a gun.
[93:03.50]I thought that cigarette was a knife.
[93:10.19]What happened?
[93:10.67]Holy fuck, why would they do the animation like that?
[93:31.81]Okay, how am I gonna do that room?
[93:35.98]I don't know how the fuck I'm gonna do this room.
[93:41.08]Holy shit, and my pants and my fucking face.
[93:43.20]Get over here, man.
[93:56.57]Oy, well, I'm thinning him out.
[93:59.09]I'm gonna try to go around and see if there's a better opportunity.
[94:07.32]Doesn't look like there is.
[94:08.14]Is there a somebody down here?
[94:12.44]Somebody with a gun?
[94:18.43]Yup.
[94:19.63]Yup.
[94:22.57]Wowee!
[94:25.67]How am I supposed to get in this room with just one Punch Man?
[94:36.55]I have to go in that room on the right, don't I?
[94:41.57]Or I have to pull them out.
[94:42.41]HOLY SHIT!
[94:59.58]I'm so disappointed.
[95:00.78]I just went all the way back in my chair and wrapped my head.
[95:20.71]Oh my god!
[95:22.39]Fuck!
[95:24.01]Damn it!
[95:30.33]Focusing on the dog.
[95:48.58]How did I get this guy last time?
[95:50.20]I debated him and he... Fuck.
[96:07.81]I felt those bullets.
[96:09.13]They missed my character and hit me.
[96:13.36]God, come on.
[96:14.56]Why?
[96:15.02]I'm not- I'm just clicking on the dog.
[96:17.10]I'm not hitting space on him.
[96:33.84]Jesus, this level is fucking brutal.
[96:40.18]I just almost missed him.
[96:41.02]Okay, back to where I was before.
[96:47.11]I'm getting, like, caught on my keyboard.
[96:55.90]I forgot about the dog, but it's okay, I got it.
[96:59.48]Alright, can I... Here's the question.
[97:01.96]Alright, I'm going for it.
[97:02.60]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[97:09.32]Alright.
[97:10.72]Now I have to bait him over here.
[97:15.59]Who has a gun?
[97:16.73]These two have guns.
[97:22.98]Was it all three of them?
[97:25.48]I got all three of them.
[97:28.66]Just this guy up here.
[97:30.02]Okay, slow down.
[97:35.51]I'm gonna get shot in the fucking head.
[97:46.02]Wowie.
[97:48.30]That was fucking rough.
[97:50.00]That was rough.
[97:53.90]I say wowie a lot.
[97:55.12]I know.
[97:57.16]Stay back.
[97:58.38]Whoa, take it easy.
[97:59.04]I'm just here to get you.
[98:00.24]Your brother sent us.
[98:00.90]We're not going to harm you.
[98:02.80]My brother?
[98:03.78]You just killed all my friends.
[98:06.58]Look, we've got a car waiting outside, so drop the gun.
[98:08.97]It's time to go.
[98:10.21]We'll drop you off at your brother's.
[98:12.53]You expect me to go with you?
[98:13.49]Are you insane?
[98:14.71]You murdered my friends.
[98:15.75]You're not taking me anywhere.
[98:17.33]Now leave me the fuck alone.
[98:20.11]Fine.
[98:20.47]You have it your way.
[98:21.21]We're out of here.
[98:24.43]What was that?
[98:26.57]Okay.
[98:31.13]Don't do it.
[98:31.83]Don't do what?
[99:11.13]I'm back.
[99:14.47]Alright, so that's not a part of a cutscene thing.
[99:20.79]That actually just did happen.
[99:22.61]Okay.
[99:28.02]Oh my fucking god.
[99:30.42]I'm... Don't... Don't do it.
[99:35.98]Don't do it.
[99:37.46]Don't fucking do it.
[99:41.12]How did you?
[99:41.76]Alright, I'll take that as a sign that I... I fucking found a new way to do this.
[99:55.09]Dog.
[100:02.48]Ah, come on!
[100:03.38]Come on!
[100:04.02]I beat it!
[100:04.50]I beat it!
[100:05.12]The fucking girl had to shoot me.
[100:07.26]Don't do it, Jeremy!
[100:08.84]Oh...
[100:38.51]Jeremy!
[100:39.09]God!
[100:39.93]Oh, I'm standing!
[100:40.81]I'm standing up right now.
[100:41.79]I can't- I did this!
[100:43.55]I already beat this mission.
[100:45.21]And I beat it very well, too.
[100:47.25]I took my fucking time.
[100:49.55]Oh, man.
[100:50.57]I need to turn on, like, a fucking- something in my ear.
[100:52.77]I need, like, a Secret Service person to be like, Don't touch the girl!
[101:02.51]I need someone to feed me lines through a fucking earpiece.
[101:05.29]Oh my god, I'm so salty right now.
[101:09.79]That's the perfect word to describe how I feel right now.
[101:12.15]It's just, like, just a... Oh, man.
[101:14.80]Oh, man.
[101:16.60]Man.
[101:17.02]I already did it.
[101:27.54]I'm full of fucking... Shake the fucking pinball machine, man.
[101:31.50]Seriously.
[101:31.90]Just shake it up and spray it all over the fucking ground.
[101:43.38]I'm gonna take my time.
[101:44.30]Fucking come on.
[101:46.22]No.
[101:54.36]The only way to play this game is go fast and lose fast.
[101:59.16]No, not me.
[102:03.86]I play this game with fucking patience.
[102:07.22]I'm trying to time my hits and shots and getting things where I want them.
[102:13.29]Okay, now I can go over here, open this door, bait him through the door.
[102:21.08]Won't be long now.
[102:23.83]How did this guy not see me?
[102:24.73]Dog!
[102:25.03]Get the dog first!
[102:25.81]Ah, fuck!
[102:33.44]Okay, whatever.
[102:45.66]Where the fuck is this guy?
[102:48.68]Where is he?
[102:49.08]He's right there with a gun and I can't... Fuck.
[102:59.25]Fuck you, get... Where's the last guy?
[103:12.29]Over here, right?
[103:13.17]Yeah, there's a couple, right?
[103:14.13]Oh my god, I remember this part!
[103:15.47]I remember being so scared here.
[103:17.87]I remember this part.
[103:18.53]I remember being terrified.
[103:21.32]Is there no other way to go?
[103:22.18]Alright, there's one guy with a Uzi.
[103:25.74]And I can't get there any other way.
[103:27.02]I have to bait him.
[103:36.18]Will he see me?
[103:37.94]From here?
[103:38.30]I don't have to run up there.
[103:39.62]But I can't see!
[103:44.79]Okay.
[103:45.67]Go.
[103:45.99]Done.
[103:46.59]Just fucking get out of here.
[103:47.45]Get the hell out of here.
[103:48.84]I'm not touching the girl.
[103:50.22]I'm not gonna... Go.
[103:52.14]Let go.
[103:52.50]Punch.
[103:52.98]Punch.
[103:53.44]No.
[103:53.78]No.
[103:54.30]Why would I ever stay back?
[103:55.44]Yes.
[103:55.74]Hold right mouse button to skip.
[103:57.74]Go.
[103:58.02]Bye.
[103:58.30]Thank you for playing.
[103:59.14]I'll see you later.
[104:13.31]Get the fuck out of here.
[104:18.50]I forget where I'm going.
[104:19.94]Where am I going?
[104:21.48]Where's the car?
[104:24.00]Where did I park my car?
[104:29.26]Alright, down here.
[104:34.09]Oh my god, thank goodness.
[104:41.51]I can't believe I had to do that again.
[104:49.22]How is that a D plus?
[104:53.34]I, I, uh... Alright, I got Alex and Ashe.
[105:04.63]Didn't get any high combos.
[105:06.81]Damn it.
[105:09.45]If you're down anytime soon, this is not a good time to be messing around.
[105:11.83]If a cop came by, saw us like this, it ain't gonna go faster with you bitching, okay?
[105:18.26]Besides, I've been telling you to get the van fixed for weeks.
[105:22.28]Right, I still don't see any of that be my job.
[105:24.40]It's not my van.
[105:25.81]Just fucking do it.
[105:27.55]You're the only one of us who ain't busy with work all day.
[105:31.79]Take it down to Andy and the Chop Shop.
[105:33.91]He owes me one.
[105:35.72]Fine, just get the car running and I'll do it tomorrow, okay?
[105:38.96]Yeah, that should do it.
[105:40.54]Try starting her up and let's see what the hell's had to happen in here.
[105:43.95]Just my Stardew Valley character all over again.
[106:03.40]What's the matter?
[106:04.44]You look a little nervous.
[106:05.34]Alright, I won out.
[106:08.48]I'm getting too old for this.
[106:09.41]I'm feeling too soft.
[106:27.46]Too soft?
[106:27.92]Too soft for what?
[106:29.44]Uh, shooting people.
[106:30.24]Putting my ass on the line.
[106:31.40]I've had a feeling I'm not gonna last much longer for a while now.
[106:34.70]Been having these dreams.
[106:36.98]Dreams, huh?
[106:37.66]You want out?
[106:38.12]You're out.
[106:38.96]But first, you have to take care of some business for me.
[106:42.18]Okay.
[106:43.43]What business?
[106:44.83]Nothing big.
[106:45.39]A chop shop downtown.
[106:48.03]They're with the Colombians now, won't give us our cup no more.
[106:52.05]Don't worry, they're just hoodlums, nothing you can't handle.
[106:56.32]And then I'm out.
[106:57.60]Yes.
[106:58.46]Though you're free to come back anytime you change your mind.
[107:01.20]As a parting gift, grab a sample of our new product here.
[107:05.72]Might spice up this new boring lifestyle you've chosen.
[107:09.70]Best voice acting ever?
[107:11.04]You want me to go for it?
[107:11.92]Fine.
[107:12.34]Here you go.
[107:16.52]Give me the next line.
[107:18.29]Give me the next voice line!
[107:27.97]Well, there's no more lines.
[107:35.41]I don't get to take the... eagle car, whatever it is.
[107:40.53]No mercy!
[107:41.45]Okay.
[108:02.30]Damn it!
[108:02.66]I'm trying to go for- I'm trying to get combos.
[108:14.48]That's never gonna happen!
[108:16.06]Okay?
[108:26.09]This game is so fucking fast-paced and so hard to lose.
[108:29.46]It's so easy to lose.
[108:31.34]Is there a skateboard on the ground?
[108:32.51]What can I do with this?
[108:33.77]Oh.
[108:46.16]You know how you get combos in this game?
[108:47.36]You have to beat the level like five times and recognize exactly where to go.
[108:51.70]That's where the combos come in.
[108:53.06]You're gonna get a fucking D plus on every mission.
[108:55.50]Or a B. It's gonna happen every time until you can sprint through and know every kill and get like a ten hit combo.
[109:07.23]Really?
[109:08.23]What the fuck is that plywood on the ground blocking?
[109:16.42]Jesus God, give me a fucking break.
[109:22.65]He's gonna shoot me through the fucking glass.
[109:23.85]Look at all the glass everywhere.
[109:31.89]Jesus Christ!
[109:34.39]Oh, come on!
[109:47.80]Eat shit.
[109:49.10]That's enough time?
[109:49.66]That gives me enough time to do this?
[110:11.14]One guy over there.
[110:12.44]Is that a bomb?
[110:13.56]What's this?
[110:13.88]Is that a bomb?
[110:14.90]That looks like a wire that's connected to a bomb.
[110:25.42]Can you shoot through couches?
[110:34.10]Oh fucking god, Jesus.
[110:44.05]Last guy, two guys.
[110:53.38]Got it.
[110:53.60]Okay.
[110:53.98]Good.
[110:54.54]Floor cleared.
[110:55.08]Let's move.
[110:58.74]Where's the next floor?
[111:09.30]Okay.
[111:10.28]So it's just at the edge of the level.
[111:11.74]You got it.
[111:12.10]Alright, let's go.
[111:17.80]Holy fuck!
[111:18.44]Where did you guys come from?
[111:19.38]Down here?
[111:19.76]Oh shit, you did.
[111:27.90]Damn it, I didn't know you could shoot over the car.
[111:40.02]Fuck.
[111:41.20]I don't have enough bullets for this.
[111:46.38]I have enough of that, and then I gotta wait, because I don't have any bullets.
[111:48.56]So, where the hell am I gonna go?
[111:49.95]This way, let's go to the left.
[111:53.91]There's a lot, okay.
[112:03.03]Where did the third fucking guy come from?
[112:06.15]Find him.
[112:06.95]Why was that guy here?
[112:08.15]What the heck?
[112:10.11]Restart it.
[112:10.59]No, don't restart it.
[112:11.35]Just die.
[112:14.37]A third guy.
[112:15.31]Empty.
[112:31.08]Fuck.
[112:42.03]Fucking glass.
[112:45.41]Glass.
[112:48.46]Alright, got it.
[112:56.46]Give me one of your guns.
[112:57.90]Oh, glass him.
[113:13.72]Other side of the Pac-Man level, here we go.
[113:16.30]Ooh, that wasn't good.
[113:18.21]That wasn't good either.
[113:24.67]That wasn't good either.
[113:30.91]Panic, panic, panic, panic!
[113:51.60]What the fuck shot me through the glass?
[113:53.67]That guy, okay.
[114:00.41]Can I, let me just be real for a second.
[114:02.68]Do you see where this motherfucker shot me from?
[114:05.08]I was down here.
[114:06.40]This guy shot through the glass, over the car, over the fucking disco machine.
[114:11.50]The guy shot from across the whole level.
[114:39.04]That didn't shoot the dog.
[114:45.96]Relax.
[114:56.16]Dog.
[114:58.38]Nobody up here.
[114:59.04]That's the guy that shot me through the glass last time.
[115:12.34]Glass?
[115:13.18]Anybody up there?
[115:13.76]Just check to make sure I'm not gonna get shot by somebody.
[115:15.62]It's a glass shooter.
[115:34.99]Oh, last guy up there.
[115:36.45]Dog.
[115:37.53]Holy fuck.
[115:38.75]Good thing I saw that right when I did.
[115:40.09]I'm just gonna wait for this guy.
[115:42.71]I don't care if I lose points.
[115:47.10]Who's left?
[115:56.58]Don't just fucking sprint through.
[115:58.10]It's not safe until everybody's dead.
[116:01.77]Which I cannot guarantee I know where they are.
[116:03.77]Okay, he's right there.
[116:04.65]Alright, good.
[116:08.72]Get the bag.
[116:12.30]The bag of money?
[116:15.18]Is that a bomb?
[116:16.14]Is that a bomb in the car?
[116:17.06]Okay, get me out of here.
[116:30.53]There's a bomb on the car.
[116:31.81]It's gonna explode.
[116:33.87]I can't fuck around in levels anymore, guys.
[116:35.39]I don't know which levels are gonna kill me or not.
[116:53.52]Well, who the hell are you?
[116:55.82]Thought you could get away, huh?
[116:57.74]Get away?
[116:58.08]I just work here.
[116:58.76]Who are you?
[117:01.77]You're freaking me out, man.
[117:03.55]It's your lucky day today, kid.
[117:04.55]This bag here just saved your life.
[117:06.30]I'm getting out of here.
[117:06.96]You should probably do the same.
[117:07.82]Now... Out of my way!
[117:22.79]Voice acting.
[117:28.77]Time bonus.
[117:29.45]Special... I'm not getting any of those bonuses.
[117:36.25]That was a C. I feel like I did that one pretty quickly.
[117:43.43]That one was, I felt like that one was pretty good.
[117:50.15]Alright, here we are.
[117:51.73]Hi honey, welcome home.
[117:52.97]I made you dinner, it's in the fridge.
[117:54.97]I'll eat it later.
[117:56.67]I'm not that hungry right now.
[117:59.16]Oh, had a rough day?
[117:59.82]Alright, you want me to be an actor?
[118:02.26]Fine, I'll be an actor.
[118:04.50]I'm not sure.
[118:05.68]I quit my job.
[118:08.86]You quit your job just like that?
[118:11.38]And your boss just let you?
[118:12.62]I thought you said, look, I'm out and that's that.
[118:16.10]Speaking of which, I've got a surprise for you, but what, what is it?
[118:22.56]You'll see tomorrow, okay?
[118:24.52]I'm feeling a bit too tired right now.
[118:26.77]I'm gonna head straight for bed.
[118:28.67]Are you gonna stay up for a while?
[118:31.77]I'm just gonna finish this show.
[118:32.87]I'll be up in a minute.
[118:43.37]Don't you know, acting guys, if there's a question mark, make it sound like a really big question.
[118:49.82]Like for instance, you're acting class 101.
[118:52.88]If the line is, for instance, did you go to the supermarket today, right?
[119:01.88]Did you go to the store today?
[119:03.48]Did you go to the supermarket today?
[119:05.14]That's like how a normal human talks, right?
[119:07.18]But if you're an actor, but acting, did you go to the supermarket today?
[119:12.50]Did you go to the supermarket today?
[119:15.80]Did you go to the supermarket today?
[119:18.97]Just talk like people don't talk and you're an actor.
[119:33.58]These pretzels are making me thirsty.
[119:36.11]Yeah, instead of just saying, these pretzels are drying me out.
[119:39.39]Do you have water or something?
[119:41.05]These pretzels are really drying my mouth out.
[119:42.34]Do you have any water?
[119:44.02]These pretzels are really drying my mouth out.
[119:46.10]Do you have any water?
[119:48.68]These pretzels are really dry.
[119:50.62]I mean, these pretzels are really dry.
[119:53.14]These pretzels are really dry.
[119:54.86]That's how you be an actor.
[120:03.72]It's drying me out.
[120:11.09]Uh, alright, okay, this is different.
[120:15.18]I'm just driving away with money in the bag.
[120:19.32]You're listening, here you go.
[120:20.52]Or, by the way, actor is also radio host or YouTuber.
[120:25.56]You're listening to WYL Miami Radio, bringing you fresh new music each day.
[120:32.88]What you like whenever you like, that's our motto.
[120:36.36]It's a beautiful day today.
[120:37.72]The sun is shining and the sky is clear.
[120:40.85]Let me read that like a normal person now.
[120:43.91]You can't go wrong with weather like this, that's for sure.
[120:46.87]Later today, we'll be premiering a hot new single from, uh, Perturberator.
[120:51.70]Meanwhile, uh, here's another song by everybody's favorite.
[120:54.60]Mitch... See?
[120:59.25]Acting.
[121:00.29]We interrupt the broadcast for an emergency weather report.
[121:03.63]A tropical storm is heading towards Florida, coming from the Atlantic.
[121:07.39]It's estimated to reach Miami by 7 p.m.
[121:10.09]We caution all residents to... Nice car you got here.
[121:17.21]Where are we going?
[121:19.17]I'm going away, far away, anywhere.
[121:20.79]It doesn't matter to me.
[121:21.69]You sure?
[121:24.27]Do you even know where you're heading?
[121:27.03]Well, the directions, a lot of people wind up going round in circles.
[121:30.80]And this road doesn't look too promising.
[121:33.28]I didn't ask for your opinion.
[121:36.00]What if I told you that this road leads to nowhere?
[121:38.54]Well, rather that you're heading for a dead end.
[121:41.38]That's where you're going.
[121:43.13]You're closing in and it's closing in fast.
[121:45.75]But you already know that, don't you?
[121:47.99]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[121:51.15]You'll see soon enough.
[121:52.89]By the way, did you forget to bring your girlfriend?
[122:00.42]If you caught the lesson I was giving you there, I was being a fucking real actor on the chicken, and I was being an actor on the fucking, the other guy, the driver.
[122:17.43]Mary?
[122:18.01]Mary?
[122:18.45]Mary?
[122:22.28]Fucking Garfield on the couch.
[122:24.10]How do you guys pick up shit like that so quickly?
[122:29.68]There's a note.
[122:31.35]Hi, honey.
[122:31.85]I'm sorry.
[122:32.29]I'm not doing the acting thing anymore.
[122:34.81]Hi, honey.
[122:35.31]I'm so sorry about this.
[122:37.27]You would have done the same thing if you were me.
[122:39.87]Love, Marie.
[122:46.56]He does it anyways.
[122:47.38]Yeah, whatever.
[122:55.89]This is called execution.
[123:01.96]Okay, you have reached the wrong number.
[123:03.91]That's the title of the game.
[123:05.77]Please hang up and try again.
[123:06.87]Beep beep.
[123:07.19]Listen to that bassline!
[123:10.67]This is a good bassline.
[123:11.79]Oh wait, hold on.
[123:15.22]Chainsaw and guns.
[123:18.78]What the hell is this?
[123:23.16]What the fuck?
[123:23.88]Hold on, you get your own ice climbers?
[123:26.03]How does this work?
[123:29.88]What the f- Oh my god, it really is the Ice Climbers.
[123:36.27]Oh.
[123:36.77]Whoa, this is weird.
[123:37.69]Okay.
[123:40.94]I- This is kinda cool.
[123:41.82]I kinda like this.
[124:07.73]Who's left?
[124:10.31]One guy over here.
[124:10.83]I thought that was a guy.
[124:19.35]Okay, no, we're good.
[124:25.86]I can't go in there?
[124:26.46]I guess not.
[124:28.32]Alright.
[124:29.64]So how do I pick up other guns?
[124:31.84]With the, uh... What is it?
[124:36.03]What are the names?
[124:36.43]What are the Ice Climbers' names?
[124:41.70]Does he reload?
[124:54.21]Do I have to... I think I have to pick up the guns on the ground, right?
[124:58.15]Yeah, there we go, okay.
[125:11.60]Fuck!
[125:12.08]I had it.
[125:12.46]Okay.
[125:13.76]I understand.
[125:27.08]That's it.
[125:32.34]No, I want to pick up... I can't pick up the other guns.
[125:34.02]Okay.
[125:34.32]Alright, grab this other gun on the ground over here.
[125:42.28]Got it, okay.
[125:51.83]One guy left.
[125:52.23]Right through the front door.
[125:57.01]No.
[125:59.53]In there.
[126:05.42]Woo!
[126:08.20]Oh, these guys are fun.
[126:10.54]Oh, these guys are really fun.
[126:13.78]Can I do anything else?
[126:14.36]Oh, I wake up here.
[126:22.35]Wait.
[126:22.89]Oh.
[126:23.03]I have to go in there?
[126:32.76]Look, I don't know.
[126:33.86]I told you.
[126:35.50]There's something strange going on.
[126:36.82]You know what I mean?
[126:38.12]Can you see that?
[126:38.72]Look right there.
[126:39.26]Can you see?
[126:39.70]What is that?
[126:41.00]Someone must have slipped me something.
[126:42.16]I mean, this can't be happening.
[126:43.72]It's like, wow, are those masks?
[126:45.29]Are we in the jungle?
[126:46.71]I'm gonna go to the jungle.
[126:47.55]I quit.
[126:47.81]You know what?
[126:48.17]Did I tell you that?
[126:49.19]No more I tell you.
[126:49.79]I'm out.
[126:50.07]Done.
[126:50.31]Finished.
[126:54.35]Holy shit.
[126:56.56]What?
[126:57.24]Are you hitting me?
[126:57.98]I just want to go home.
[126:59.12]Can you call Mary?
[127:00.10]She'll come get me.
[127:02.08]Am I bleeding?
[127:02.66]Do I need to go to the hospital?
[127:04.58]Guys, I just want to go home.
[127:15.77]Holy shit.
[127:20.81]That was a little... That's too bad.
[127:33.38]Alright, we got a B-.
[127:37.54]That's right.
[127:38.24]I'm gonna march back home with that in my hand, and I'm gonna be playing fucking show tunes in my head while I march back to fucking hold it in front of me to show bomb.
[127:50.55]I'm opening the door with it out in front, holding it out.
[127:59.91]Mark.
[128:04.77]Third act.
[128:05.45]Climax.
[128:09.04]Climax.
[128:09.52]I don't know if it's the heat, but I feel a bit drunk.
[128:17.96]Me too.
[128:18.34]I'm thinking about heading back to camp.
[128:21.28]I'm good for another round or two.
[128:24.44]You guys head on back.
[128:25.68]I'll catch up with you later.
[128:27.71]You don't tell me what to do, okay?
[128:29.69]I'm gonna show you how to drink, you hear me?
[128:32.41]Well, I guess we'll see you guys back at camp then.
[128:35.60]Just remember that we have a job to do tonight, fellas.
[128:43.00]Okay.
[128:48.64]Excuse me guys, do you have a second?
[128:50.18]I'd like to get a picture of you if you don't mind.
[128:53.02]Sure thing.
[128:54.74]Could you send me a copy if I give you my address?
[128:57.48]No need.
[128:57.88]We have Polaroid.
[128:59.54]Would you mind stepping out into the sun here for a bit?
[129:01.68]Do I have to do something?
[129:11.91]No, no.
[129:12.45]Alright.
[129:12.67]Good luck out there, guys.
[129:13.55]Thanks for letting me get a shot.
[129:15.67]No worries, man.
[129:16.31]Good luck to you, too.
[129:23.93]Okay.
[129:26.31]But now what?
[129:31.11]Why is the world spinning?
[129:38.70]Oh, I had to take the Polar.

[130:06.03]Special delivery coming in tonight.
[130:08.01]Wouldn't want to drink all that bourbon alone.
[130:09.97]Not in this goddamn place.
[130:11.37]Uh, I'm gonna say shotgun.
[130:15.11]No.
[130:15.61]Yeah.
[130:16.13]Well, I have to use it now.
[130:19.25]Okay.
[130:20.97]So, I can't put it down.
[130:29.76]Ambush.
[130:31.66]What the hell is happening in this game?
[130:43.07]What the hell is this?
[130:44.25]Alright, we're... Okay.
[130:57.42]Good thing you didn't look that way.
[130:58.56]Oh, I can take a knife out.
[131:09.17]So I can't pick weapons up off the ground in these levels.
[131:11.01]Alright, whatever.
[131:11.43]Whatever.
[131:18.57]Area clear.
[131:20.27]Can I reload?
[131:28.53]Not conserving ammo.
[131:29.93]Oh shit.
[131:31.03]Alright, I'll conserve ammo.
[131:46.32]Cut him!
[131:46.66]Cut him!
[131:52.37]Really?
[131:52.61]Alright, conserving ammo.
[132:10.91]How does that guy not shoot me?
[132:11.99]I don't know.
[132:12.29]Alright, let me pay attention.
[132:14.69]Can this guy shoot over this?
[132:17.53]Oh, conserving ammo.
[132:19.73]Aye, aye, aye.
[132:22.73]Nobody down?
[132:23.35]Okay.
[132:23.67]I just have to worry about this guy here.
[132:25.01]What about down there?
[132:30.49]I'm gonna have to shoot that guy, aren't I?
[132:38.86]I have to shoot this guy.
[132:45.06]Oh, fuck.
[132:58.14]Is this ammo boxes?
[133:01.16]Where are they?
[133:01.58]Are there any ammo boxes here?
[133:16.09]Shoot the last round.
[133:20.24]Shoot once.
[133:20.78]Okay, get ammo.
[133:26.26]Okay.
[133:29.71]There we go.
[133:30.53]Look, we're fine.
[133:34.85]I didn't get- I got played.
[133:36.11]I would have been so upset if that were the case.
[133:42.71]Were you guys trying to bait me and it actually worked out in my favor?
[133:53.11]Oh, damn it.
[133:53.49]That would have been like 10 combo there.
[133:54.83]Oops-a-daisy.
[134:00.39]Where the fuck am I?
[134:02.11]What?
[134:04.02]Okay.
[134:06.68]Okay, that was stupid.
[134:33.84]Alright, we got guy with the gun, guy with the blade.
[134:36.86]Guy with the gun first.
[134:41.58]Bingo!
[134:43.70]BINGO!
[134:46.02]James here, I'm done, uh, weeding out the garden.
[134:48.26]How's it going with the yard?
[134:50.42]Hank here, ran out of fuel for the lawn mowers.
[134:53.10]We're at the gas station.
[134:55.13]Hand it over and we'll share the ride back.
[134:59.47]Uh, leave the area.
[135:01.99]I don't think I can do anything else here, so might as well just go.
[135:10.72]That had to have been pretty good.
[135:13.68]That's got to be at least a B. I'll take a B-.
[135:27.08]Better than expected.
[135:29.45]I'm even prouder to show that to Mom.
[135:31.75]Mom doesn't expect me to get AIDS.
[135:35.33]Weapon unlocked big and heavy.
[135:44.53]Oh.
[135:45.39]Okay.
[135:48.58]Hmm.
[135:49.36]Looks like we got our hands on some good intel here.
[135:52.90]We should get this back to the colonel as soon as possible.
[135:55.87]Not sure what to do with the captives, though.
[135:58.11]Maybe we should just let Barnes have his way.
[136:01.07]Would make the jog back to camp a hell of a lot easier.
[136:07.49]This is watching a movie right now.
[136:12.19]Oh, pause it right there.
[136:13.06]Hold on a second.
[136:13.72]You're trying to tell me that a Bluetooth plug
[136:20.15]Uh, alright.
[136:30.08]Did you guys catch the news on Channel 6 last night?
[136:32.52]Looks like we're famous now.
[136:36.89]Yeah, looks like we got our five minutes of fame.
[136:39.57]I'd say it was more like two.
[136:42.65]Damn, I didn't catch it.
[136:43.65]What did they say?
[136:45.17]Do you think you can call the news station and ask for a copy?
[136:48.27]I mean, I'd pay big bucks to see it.
[136:50.87]Why don't you call the police and turn yourself in while you're at it?
[136:54.17]Yeah, that probably would be a good idea.
[136:56.61]I'm sure they'll run another story on us sooner or later anyway.
[136:59.79]I'm not so sure about that.
[137:00.89]We'd have to off more people first, you know?
[137:04.61]He's right.
[137:05.25]Not sure what to do about that.
[137:06.79]We can't just go out and kill random people now, can we?
[137:10.23]I might have an idea.
[137:11.91]I thought... Hold on.
[137:16.14]I can't do Donald Duck.
[137:16.88]I bought some weed from a couple of creeps.
[137:23.50]A few days ago.
[137:34.31]Okay.
[137:35.79]He's choking.
[137:51.98]treasure hunting, but more drugs.
[137:57.29]No, I can't.
[137:58.13]I don't know how people do Donald Duck.
[137:59.23]It's fucking hard.
[138:00.17]Well, there might be more assholes there.
[138:01.66]I don't know.
[138:03.36]You got anything better to do?
[138:04.84]I wouldn't mind going for a ride.
[138:05.96]Let's check it out.
[138:07.92]We could always grab some pizza if we don't find anything.
[138:15.46]Yeah, there's one thing of being able to do a duck.
[138:17.84]Like... You know what I'm talking about.
[138:21.88]But being able to form words in a coherent sentence as the Donald Duck voice is so hard to do.
[138:28.22]Two machine guns.
[138:29.20]I'm staying with these two.
[138:30.12]These two are fun.
[138:35.89]Leave or die.
[138:40.65]Check the back.
[138:42.45]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[138:44.27]Okay.
[138:46.75]I cased the joint successfully.
[138:48.03]Let's go.
[138:58.55]Right into his gut!
[139:03.11]That's it!
[139:04.05]Done!
[139:08.74]Whoa!
[139:11.70]That's all there was to it, huh?
[139:14.31]Did you hear that?
[139:15.75]Hear what?
[139:17.23]Sounds like someone's in that room over there.
[139:20.44]I already checked.
[139:21.02]There's no one in there.
[139:27.04]Oops.
[139:31.12]Okay, well, we're going down even further.
[139:35.48]I don't understand these walls.
[139:36.42]Are these walls?
[139:37.39]Not really.
[139:38.75]Okay, well, I didn't get it.
[139:47.25]Well, okay, that's three.
[139:53.07]Shit, I missed.
[140:04.72]Come on, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on!
[140:06.60]What we got, guy with a gun?
[140:08.43]That's no problem for me.
[140:16.80]Keep going.
[140:17.22]Fast.
[140:17.64]Hurry up.
[140:18.42]A+.
[140:18.64]Let's go.
[140:32.52]Whee!
[140:48.38]Alright, don't go crazy here.
[140:52.00]I fucking, my own partner just shot me in the head.
[140:54.40]That's what it looked like.
[140:57.22]I'm trying to rush.
[141:01.44]What the fuck happened there?
[141:09.80]Give me a fucking break.
[141:10.73]How did he not get shot by that?
[141:29.80]Damn it.
[141:30.78]Trying to focus too much on the shooting.
[141:33.50]The shooting is the backup to me.
[141:38.64]I was right-clicking and it wouldn't shoot.
[141:49.67]Okay, relax.
[141:50.71]Seven bullets.
[141:57.60]Okay, dog!
[141:58.74]Don't forget about the dog.
[141:59.66]Alright, good, good, good, good, good.
[142:09.68]Holy fuck, I almost missed.
[142:10.92]It's okay.
[142:11.55]Anybody else?
[142:12.73]Guy down there, he's melee, just drag him up.
[142:21.41]Shit, okay.
[142:30.27]Whoops!
[142:32.11]Whoops!
[142:32.45]I got one.
[142:52.43]FUCK!
[142:53.05]NO!
[142:53.65]GOD DAMMIT!
[142:54.77]What the hell?
[142:56.33]That's bullshit!
[142:59.54]Come on, man.
[143:04.92]That was such dog shit.
[143:06.70]He just like fucking insta-turned.
[143:11.38]I'm so fucking mad about that one.
[143:15.88]I wasn't even paying attention.
[143:22.62]Missed the chance.
[143:23.32]Ugh.
[143:39.69]Another dog, right?
[143:42.46]I'm surprised that didn't get it.
[143:53.78]Get that gun.
[143:54.44]Pick it up.
[143:56.18]Pick up the gun.
[143:58.19]Is there a reason why you won't pick the gun up?
[144:00.47]There you go.
[144:00.87]Okay, jeez.
[144:01.39]Oh, I guess he does it himself.
[144:02.91]Okay.
[144:18.39]Nobody else up there, right?
[144:19.59]Just this guy with a gun?
[144:25.29]Down, down, down, down, down.
[144:26.57]Who's down here?
[144:29.93]Okay, same deal.
[144:30.81]I just gotta shoot that guy.
[144:43.26]He's in such an awkward spot, too.
[144:48.14]Okay, fine, bye.
[144:59.55]Faster, hurry, hurry, hurry, go to the car!
[145:01.39]I'm going, I'm faster!
[145:04.42]Secret?
[145:12.61]Faster, faster, faster, faster!
[145:14.47]I'm going!
[145:14.97]I'm trying!
[145:15.55]I got some pretty decent combo.
[145:25.50]I got like an almost times 9, times 10.
[145:29.86]A small time bonus.
[145:32.01]It's okay.
[145:37.17]Got it.
[145:38.29]A minus.
[145:45.00]Boomer speedrun strats.
[145:48.80]No, it's called a regular strat.
[145:50.74]Good strat.
[145:51.86]Why does this change... change perspective so many times in this game?
[145:57.75]Who is it?
[145:58.99]It's the police.
[145:59.59]Open the door.
[146:01.05]Just a second, I gotta put on some clothes.
[146:06.05]Uh, okay.
[146:10.22]Wait, that was the duck!
[146:11.66]That's the duck costume!
[146:20.75]The police are already in here?
[146:27.13]Uh... Can I go in the car?
[146:36.26]Uh, okay.
[146:40.14]Uh, who is that?
[146:48.95]How did you get in here?
[146:50.73]The door wasn't locked.
[146:51.44]I let myself in.
[146:52.04]I hope you don't mind.
[147:01.34]Blind.
[147:02.66]Blind streamer.
[147:03.59]What are you talking about?
[147:05.25]Well, what do you want?
[147:06.45]I'm looking for an Ash Davis.
[147:08.47]This is listed as his last known address.
[147:11.99]Well, as you can see, he's not here.
[147:13.17]I don't know where he is.
[147:14.57]He doesn't live here anymore.
[147:15.88]Was there anything else?
[147:20.32]Will you tell him to contact Miami PD next time you see him?
[147:24.96]You're his sister, aren't you?
[147:26.14]I can see you got the good genes.
[147:28.19]You're very pretty.
[147:29.11]If there was nothing else, I would like for you to leave.
[147:37.31]Now I have to take it.
[147:38.71]I'm just switching control.
[147:40.51]Who's the protagonist in this game?
[147:47.75]Dead ahead.
[147:52.09]Ooh.
[147:53.78]That's interesting.
[147:54.78]So, alright, I gotta pee.
[147:56.44]We're taking our first break of the night.
[147:58.20]I'll be right back.
[147:59.36]Pee time.
[148:01.93]Sorry for the static.
[148:07.12]I'll mute it.
[148:08.12]Alright, be right back.
[150:47.26]I think it would be funny if I use this on every beat right back and the new viewers just have no fucking idea what's happening.
[150:59.11]What, my cam's on?
[151:01.67]Oh, okay.
[151:11.51]I refreshed the page and I had no idea what was going on.
[151:16.17]Ugh.
[151:19.13]Alright.
[151:20.19]We're back.
[151:22.43]And by the way, hold on, let me just open up this, uh... Fresh beer.
[151:29.11]Fucking Coors Light.
[151:37.10]Now you are a boomer.
[151:40.38]It's- I'm drink- It's a Coca-Cola.
[151:42.20]It's just a fucking Coke.
[151:46.26]Is it Monster- Why would I drink a Monster energy drink?
[151:49.91]What the hell would I ever do that for?
[151:58.80]What?
[151:59.30]Wait, what's down here?
[152:08.48]This is a really, this is a really thick Coke though.
[152:11.30]Like, is this supposed to be like this?
[152:13.00]You know what I mean?
[152:21.23]Chewy.
[152:24.63]Is this supposed to be chewy?
[152:26.13]That's weird.
[152:38.01]What the fuck happened?
[152:39.52]What?
[152:40.74]What character am I?
[152:41.76]Oh, it's me right there.
[152:48.12]Come on.
[152:48.64]Keep it up.
[152:49.08]Keep it up.
[152:49.38]Come on.
[152:49.58]Keep up the punch.
[152:51.79]Wow!
[153:02.64]My god!
[153:03.16]Fucking guy with a machine gun!
[153:30.85]Hmm, I got an idea.
[153:32.36]Come over here.
[153:34.82]You, God, come over here.
[153:42.71]And you hit me behind a wall.
[153:44.27]I'm trying to bait that guy.
[153:45.19]Why won't the guy look at me?
[153:48.17]He's just staring at me, and he just won't come over here.
[153:51.38]You fucking dummy.
[154:02.26]Alright, get the fuck over here.
[154:11.82]You!
[154:12.74]You come over here!
[154:13.65]Okay, who's left?
[154:17.41]That guy, that guy, that guy, I gotta throw.
[154:19.13]How the hell am I gonna do this?
[154:23.21]I gotta go up to here.
[154:24.41]Gun.
[154:29.09]Who's first?
[154:29.73]This guy right here.
[154:30.41]Oh, and I right clicked.
[154:32.94]What?
[154:33.16]What?
[155:02.07]I don't know.
[155:03.71]They're ducking.
[155:05.99]I get it.
[155:06.37]I understand.
[155:06.83]I get it.
[155:07.11]I get it.
[155:07.31]Everybody watch it.
[155:08.31]I get it.
[155:09.31]It's a stand up.
[155:11.31]Gotcha.
[155:13.97]Fuck.
[155:14.23]I have one bullet.
[155:16.17]Oh, that's not good.
[155:20.66]Oh, I can't duck.
[155:22.64]I can't duck.
[155:23.50]This is a fun game.
[155:24.68]You know what?
[155:37.97]Dude, I don't know how the hell you could beat this in 10 seconds.
[155:42.73]You gotta be real damn good at this.
[155:48.99]This guy's gonna collapse on me if I don't take him out right now.
[155:52.05]Almost died again.
[155:53.05]Alright, here we go.
[155:54.39]I gotta get a better spot.
[155:55.83]I like this spot up here.
[155:56.85]Because it's near more guns, I can get this guy while being blocked.
[156:02.10]You fucking stupid video game.
[156:04.92]Who even plays these anymore?
[156:06.60]Who even plays these anymore?
[156:07.61]Seriously.
[156:12.49]Fucking video games, right?
[156:13.71]Like, why would you play them?
[156:29.79]You gotta be kidding me.
[156:30.75]Who even fucking plays him anymore?
[156:51.06]Who even fucking plays him?
[156:55.83]See me!
[156:58.17]Alright.
[157:00.10]Oh, Boomer Rage.
[157:07.95]Why did he not stand up and his friend underneath him did?
[157:11.51]He has a clear shot and he doesn't stand up but the other guy does.
[157:16.61]I can't even hit the first guy anymore.
[157:29.43]I'm so fucking angry at this.
[157:35.33]They don't make video games like they used to.
[157:37.06]Remember how easy they used to be?
[157:38.34]Do you remember?
[157:42.40]God, I miss like the golden age of video games.
[157:46.00]Remember back?
[157:46.54]Remember Mega Man 4?
[157:49.85]You remember that one?
[157:50.53]Yeah, I do.
[157:52.49]Yeah, I remember it being unbearable and almost unplayably difficult.
[157:56.29]And you had to start the whole game over again if you lost like three times.
[157:59.98]Remember that?
[158:00.28]Remember video games used to be so much easier?
[158:07.39]Oh my god, I- I remember Castlevania.
[158:18.07]That was such a fucking fun game.
[158:21.85]I loved having one item to attack with and you get bounced around.
[158:29.81]Hey, remember Donkey Kong Country?
[158:31.70]That game was fucking... Remember how awesome that game was?
[158:34.64]Hey, go play one of the Bounce Around in the Barrels levels, and then you tell me how great that game is.
[158:40.66]Get past, like, the second world in Donkey Kong Country, and then you tell me if games used to be fucking easy.
[159:13.58]Yeah!
[159:22.06]Wowee!
[159:22.74]Where'd you come from?
[159:23.48]Oh, wowee!
[159:24.14]Is that like my new fucking catchphrase?
[159:26.58]Did you guys, you pull the cord on my back and that's what I say?
[159:29.44]I have four phrases.
[159:31.70]Wowee!
[159:41.21]What the hell?
[159:49.68]Suck a fart out of my ass.
[160:09.56]I keep forgetting this is not a wall right here.
[160:12.38]I keep thinking it is.
[160:22.20]Sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint.
[160:23.78]Oh no, don't sprint.
[160:33.67]Alright, there's a spot right here that I'm not going to get shot, because I can walk past that.
[160:37.32]Alright, so easy now.
[160:38.28]This is a safe zone.
[160:39.14]Why don't you come over here?
[160:46.06]After three attempts, I finally got the gun.
[160:54.85]If you miss, don't worry.
[160:56.17]You always get a second chance.
[160:57.19]Alright, what is left in here?
[161:09.09]Oh my god, I almost just did it.
[161:10.75]Okay.
[161:13.59]Stage clear.
[161:16.42]Fast, one, two, three, go!
[161:51.68]Alright, who's left?
[161:54.13]What the fuck was that guy?
[161:55.85]Where was he?
[161:58.05]What happened?
[161:58.63]I'm so confused right now.
[161:59.87]What happened?
[162:02.66]I don't even know where that guy was.
[162:08.64]What the- that guy- did he just shoot himself?
[162:27.89]I fucking tried to throw.
[162:40.08]I got stuck in the fucking doorway.
[162:42.64]It's like my guy's body is made out of magnets and when you touch a door, you just get sucked into it.
[163:03.19]Bring the other fucking dog up here.
[163:04.35]Just do it.
[163:04.67]I mean, just do it.
[163:05.33]The dog's coming.
[163:06.05]Just bring it.
[163:11.92]Oh my god.
[163:12.84]Damn it.
[163:13.32]Why?
[163:35.74]Where the fuck are you?
[163:36.78]Okay.
[163:37.61]Don't let some random guy get out of bed.
[163:40.05]It's like fucking Minecraft bed and come get me.
[163:42.19]I need a better view.
[163:59.50]Alright, so there's... Nobody with a gun over there.
[164:02.47]So I can get down into that room.
[164:03.71]But I gotta be careful because of the windows.
[164:26.98]Anybody in that room?
[164:28.72]Okay, one more guy.
[164:29.70]Alright, I think I can get it.
[164:33.69]Okay, six shots.
[164:35.49]Nobody in there has a gun.
[164:36.89]This guy's... I did not expect that to happen that quickly.
[164:40.69]Got it, okay.
[164:45.47]Ooh, tough game we got here.
[164:46.95]Tough game!
[164:47.81]Is that it?
[164:53.68]No.
[164:55.20]Hold on, let me...
[165:04.49]Tough game we got here.
[165:10.97]Whoa, he sent us away though!
[165:18.17]Baaah!
[165:21.94]What the fuck are you doing?
[165:23.06]Get up, you fucking idiot!
[165:24.80]Why?
[165:26.16]Ahh!
[165:30.43]Okay, we're safe.
[165:32.77]Just shoot the doctor as I walk by.
[165:56.87]What am I doing?
[165:57.99]Why would you even walk up there?
[165:59.19]There's no reason for you to do it, you just did!
[166:00.95]My hand's in the air.
[166:03.31]That was pretty good too!
[166:57.16]And it's... It's... One fucking pixel away, apparently.
[167:22.87]Okay, easy.
[167:26.47]I'm just, I don't care.
[167:30.56]Line them up.
[167:39.97]I'm just testing my, it's just a patience test.
[167:44.33]This is a gear check for me to see if I'm patient at all.
[168:04.45]I'm eating my coke, I'm chewing on my chewy coke I'm just trying to go too fast
[168:36.69]Okay.
[168:38.69]Guns?
[168:39.07]No.
[168:42.58]Anybody with a gun in there?
[168:43.40]I don't know.
[168:46.64]I don't know.
[168:54.99]That's the only... Okay, that's the gun with the rooms.
[169:07.22]Hey!
[169:07.64]Hey!
[169:08.10]Hey!
[169:08.58]Hey!
[169:09.08]Hey!
[169:09.40]Oh!
[169:10.92]Oh!
[169:12.85]Oh!
[169:13.67]Where do I go?
[169:18.47]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[169:19.47]I don't know what I'm doing.
[169:20.43]I gotta go this way.
[169:37.13]WHA- HEY!
[169:37.43]WAIT A MINUTE!
[169:38.00]Ugh! No!
[169:52.00]Fuck! Fuck. I'm so- I had a gun.
[169:56.00]I didn't even think I had a gun.
[170:00.00]How was I supposed to know?
[170:01.00]I was supposed to- agh.
[170:06.87]Oh my fucking god.
[170:08.85]Who made this game?
[170:11.31]Why did you make this game?
[170:12.53]Why did you make this game?
[170:16.59]Why did you make this game for?
[170:23.54]Fucking door.
[170:27.84]I made this game for you.
[170:32.32]Why are they there?
[170:33.96]No!
[170:34.26]Oh, I'm gonna unravel.
[170:38.60]I'm un- I'm gonna unravel.
[170:40.30]Mm-hmm.
[170:40.94]Oh, that's gonna happen.
[170:41.48]We're already like three hours into this and I'm like, I'm already fucking unraveling.
[170:44.32]Alright.
[170:57.30]Okay, how many shots does- I shot him three times.
[171:16.98]I don't think they're gonna even see me I've unraveled completely Wowie!
[171:32.15]Wowie!
[171:54.62]Fucking god, they just have so many angles!
[172:00.32]There's so many angles on me!
[172:03.02]It's horrible!
[172:14.26]Give me the fucking gun!
[172:15.77]What?
[172:16.59]Why does it not?
[172:18.27]Why?
[172:20.27]I wanna pick the gun up off the fucking ground!
[172:31.26]I'm gonna literally take 15 straight minutes to beat this.
[172:35.11]I'm gonna go as slow as humanly possible.
[172:37.17]Ready?
[172:38.25]I'm literally gonna take 25 fucking minutes starting now, count.
[173:09.12]Where's the gun?
[173:09.56]I need another gun.
[173:11.06]I need another gun.
[173:13.74]Oh my god, the fucking perfect angle!
[173:20.33]Give me a fucking break!
[173:33.28]Oh my god, this is just pain, the video game.
[173:49.34]Oh, and like, all of a sudden that guy, that guy, let me, okay, that guy just fucking sprinted down to shoot me.
[173:56.11]Where was that guy?
[173:57.53]Why was he the only one that sprinted to my exact location?
[174:01.85]He's the only one that saw me.
[174:03.17]Only guy.
[174:05.49]I'm just gonna, you know, I'm just gonna sprint to his exact location and shoot him.
[174:09.04]What?
[174:11.38]Why did this fucking guy not see me?
[174:13.06]This guy, that guy, this guy, no, a guy like, a guy all the fucking way up here was like, yeah, there he is, I'll go this way.
[174:54.15]Oh no, nooooooo!
[175:04.50]This level is a pleb filter?
[175:11.52]Oh, it's called Unraveling.
[175:12.76]I had the fucking level beat already!
[175:16.33]And one of these dickheads accidentally killed me up there.
[175:18.75]Now I gotta do the whole fucking thing over again.
[175:29.45]And there's another dog!
[175:30.57]Well, this is just fucking wonderful.
[175:33.35]What the hell am I supposed to do about this?
[175:44.74]Jesus God, give me the gun for the love of all that is sacred.
[175:51.82]Up there.
[175:52.14]I can shoot all the way from fucking there down here.
[175:55.10]Fuck off.
[176:02.82]You know what we call that?
[176:03.89]We call that bullshit.
[176:09.13]Oh my God.
[176:12.57]Why do those fucking guys have to exist in a game where everybody dies in one hit?
[176:16.37]The guy that takes like five.
[176:18.13]It's just, oh my God.
[176:21.72]It's driving me crazy.
[176:38.65]Fuck this level!
[176:45.40]This is the longest I've spent on a level in the two fucking- both of these games.
[176:57.24]I'm so angry that I didn't hit any of those.
[177:04.52]I hate the doors.
[177:05.20]Remove the doors.
[177:06.28]Is there like a cheat I can put in to remove all doors from the game?
[177:17.43]They're just a hindrance.
[177:18.93]They just get in the fucking way.
[177:20.97]All doors.
[177:21.43]When are they gonna... Can I patch that in?
[177:26.19]Oh fucking god, I don't have...
[177:43.86]Oh my fucking god.
[177:53.08]Somebody said this is the- this is one of the worst missions in the game.
[177:55.22]Alright, I don't- I don't get it.
[178:02.72]So you shoot the big guy, they literally don't die for like five straight seconds and then they die.
[178:06.71]You only have to shoot them once.
[178:20.21]I hate this level.
[178:21.66]This is ruining the whole game for me.
[178:43.55]This level... I think this is the level that made me stop playing.
[178:46.37]Are you really?
[178:46.84]For real?
[178:47.56]Is it not just me?
[178:58.77]I heard a dog.
[178:59.47]Where the fuck is he?
[179:00.09]I only have two bullets.
[179:16.64]Now what the fuck am I gonna do?
[179:25.32]None of those guys have guns.
[179:27.12]Don't get seen by these guys.
[179:28.36]That happens every time.
[179:34.02]Oh.
[179:36.05]My fucking god.
[179:58.85]Where did that guy come from?
[180:00.05]Did he shoot me?
[180:00.61]Oh, sorry.
[180:01.47]He shot me.
[180:02.11]Is it the guy that shot me from across the whole game through the window?
[180:04.95]I was just curious.
[180:15.18]Now what the fuck?
[180:30.75]I gotta make it across, but... Oh, there he is!
[180:35.31]Okay, got him.
[180:53.78]What are these fucking patrols?
[180:56.78]How many more people he got in that room with a gun?
[181:16.52]Why is this guy still in Anor Londo?
[181:22.12]I have to go around this way.
[181:23.24]Anybody with a gun over here?
[181:24.94]No, there's not.
[181:30.26]Okay.
[181:30.56]I have two bullets.
[181:40.95]Fuck.
[181:49.86]I'm gonna get sniped from across the map, aren't I?
[181:55.13]I thought the waves was a gun.
[181:56.35]Alright, nobody else has a gun, but neither do I. This is not good.
[182:01.65]This is really bad.
[182:06.92]I need to get one of those guns.
[182:10.62]Preferably the shotgun.
[182:14.91]Got it, okay.
[182:16.13]I'm going back.
[182:16.73]No, stay over here.
[182:25.60]Is anybody coming around the sides?
[182:27.37]Is anybody coming around the sides?
[182:28.85]Just kill me!
[182:33.79]Where's the other guy?
[182:36.37]Where's this last person?
[182:38.45]Oh my, thank god.
[182:41.71]Oh my fucking god, get me out of here.
[182:44.09]I hate this, the worst level ever, I hate this.
[182:52.91]No, this way, there's more.
[183:01.30]I'm gonna- that just made me almost cry.
[183:03.66]I almost just cried on stream.
[183:10.96]Am I doing it right?
[183:30.22]Look, what are these guys?
[183:36.60]It's the windows that just do it to me, man.
[183:38.72]I just can't handle it.
[183:46.44]Okay.
[183:48.22]There's too many things to pay attention to.
[183:52.99]Like somebody can- if someone- when people can just shoot you across the whole map, it just makes you so paranoid.
[183:59.48]Like, that guy right there can shoot through the whole game over here to kill me.
[184:22.48]What in the name of God?
[184:25.02]Oh, you bastard game with the fucking door.
[184:33.72]Fucking door.
[184:34.72]Man, rip it off the hinges.
[184:37.04]Is there a character that puts a mask on that could rip the fucking door off the hinges?
[184:55.10]Oh my god.
[184:58.08]Gee, and where did you come from?
[185:05.23]Is there a guy with a shotgun up here apparently somehow?
[185:27.12]Oh my fucking god.
[185:50.53]I can do it too, asshole.
[185:58.58]Ugh.
[185:59.30]No, God.
[186:00.74]Fucking windows.
[186:02.48]They're everywhere.
[186:11.86]I'm so paranoid.
[186:14.49]If I step foot out there, I'm dead.
[186:16.96]I'm gonna- Can I go down?
[186:17.92]I'm gonna try going this way.
[186:28.49]Window right there.
[186:31.09]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[186:32.27]I like- The windows, man.
[186:34.37]It just makes it so easy for you to get shot from anywhere.
[187:01.67]You can win by just spraying, but yeah, but I... I'm gonna alert the whole room and then I'm gonna get collapsed on.
[187:14.70]Where the fuck did that guy come from?
[187:16.24]What was he doing over here?
[187:21.51]Who is the AI director spawning in these enemies?
[187:30.07]You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
[188:11.92]Fucking goddamn game, man.
[188:14.08]This goddamn fucking game.
[188:17.69]Did the same guys make the first one and the second one?
[188:19.59]Is this the same team that made the second one?
[188:38.72]God damn it!
[188:46.19]He's supposed to die!
[188:47.71]Fucking Jesus!
[188:56.64]Only shoot him once!
[188:58.36]And he'll die!
[188:59.04]I feel like way more than the first game.
[189:03.44]Like moving a quarter of an inch kills you in this one.
[189:08.94]Am I right on that?
[189:10.22]Is it like moving three inches kills you in this game?
[189:53.82]I feel like I just have to stay in the same corner the whole time.
[189:59.65]Because if I move, there's a hundred people that just have 20 different angles with like sniper rifles.
[190:34.63]I'm out of bullets.
[190:35.39]Alright, so... Give me this.
[190:55.10]One guy with a gun.
[190:57.26]There's more than one guy with a gun.
[191:05.07]Anybody have a gun over here?
[191:09.93]Somebody has to have a gun.
[191:21.91]What the fuck was that aim?
[191:23.93]What the hell are you shooting at?
[191:32.71]Try another one!
[191:33.45]Try a shotgun this time!
[191:40.19]Shoot through the game!
[191:41.07]I think that's it.
[191:53.15]Get me out of here, please.
[192:01.65]That was the worst one by far.
[192:10.02]Where the fuck am I going?
[192:21.23]I forgot how long ago that was because I hated that part too.
[192:33.69]You haven't seen the worst?
[192:36.41]There are still more horrors?
[192:40.09]Really?
[192:41.87]You know you shouldn't have- REALLY?
[192:43.33]There's a level later on that turns your keyboard into acid.
[193:00.36]You know, you should really wait for backup in these situations.
[193:03.16]It's not my fault you guys took so long to get here, is it?
[193:07.76]I got here first.
[193:08.36]You got a problem with that?
[193:09.20]Mmm, what are you?
[193:10.51]Reckless.
[193:11.59]Your actions endanger this whole operation.
[193:14.67]Give me a break, Operation.
[193:15.65]What are you talking about?
[193:16.79]If you don't like it, go complain to the chief.
[193:18.33]I'm out of here.
[193:20.61]I'm out of here.
[193:21.27]He's right.
[193:23.43]Just get me to the next level.
[193:27.37]I can look at the game with a fresh new start after that one.
[193:38.59]A nice chill stream.
[193:41.75]Somehow I got a C plus on that.
[193:43.03]It would take 40 minutes to do that.
[193:44.67]How did I get a C plus on that one but like a fucking D on the other one?
[193:47.81]And I did the other one way cleaner.
[193:49.82]This one took 40 minutes.
[193:51.42]How did I get a D on the other one and a C on that?
[193:55.18]I don't understand.
[193:59.94]Let me guess, our serial killer has been at it again.
[194:03.82]What gave it away?
[194:09.16]He left another message for her, as mundane as ever.
[194:11.02]Please don't make me do it again.
[194:12.24]Well, at least he got a bit creative with the victim.
[194:15.54]Poor kid.
[194:17.06]Maybe he was upset that the papers haven't made a bigger deal of him.
[194:20.68]These scumbags seem to crave attention.
[194:23.32]I gotta relax.
[194:23.90]I'm so angry at that last level.
[194:26.50]I can still feel it.
[194:29.36]Red check.
[194:35.23]Am I, like, fucking red?
[194:39.10]I got like a red nose.
[194:41.74]I'm like red down here.
[194:47.45]Not really.
[194:47.89]Alright, well that's fine.
[194:51.53]I'm looking at the wrong camera.
[195:06.02]You expected an out of sync.
[195:09.54]Don't we all, huh?
[195:10.28]I gotta relax!
[195:10.60]Change of plans.
[195:44.63]I need like a meditation video.
[195:52.61]I need to do a meditation.
[195:55.54]Guided meditation.
[195:57.68]Hold on.
[196:07.69]I'm gonna mute this for a second.
[196:08.69]I have to do this, guys.
[196:09.49]I'm sorry.
[196:10.43]I'm like, I'm all fired up.
[196:29.97]It's supposed to be instructions.
[196:34.33]Thank you for being here, dear soul.
[196:36.73]I'm Kenneth.
[196:37.83]And from my heart, I will... Is this the cheers for you guy?
[196:40.69]This is the cheers to you guy?
[196:42.35]I think this is the cheers to you.
[196:44.37]...as comfortable as you can right now in this moment.
[196:49.42]Allow yourself to just be here and now.
[196:55.45]Observing the words I share with you like a soft breeze on a summer night.
[197:04.24]Noticing whatever it is that you notice, your body may begin to relax more and more as you listen to my voice and go deeper.
[197:15.75]How would somebody be able to sleep to this?
[197:18.01]Could you imagine?
[197:19.01]Alright.
[197:19.45]Seriously, wait a second.
[197:21.19]Wait.
[197:22.85]Can you imagine if you were trying to go to sleep?
[197:25.52]Okay.
[197:26.46]You lay down and you're like, man, I really wish I had something to help me go to sleep.
[197:29.88]And I'm like, let me help you there.
[197:31.66]And I go right up to your fucking ear.
[197:33.70]And I'm like,
[197:35.32]Very soon you'll be sleeping.
[197:38.44]And just to let you know, it's so relaxing in this room.
[197:42.44]And very soon you'll be going to bed.
[197:45.40]Just like the breeze of a sunny summer Monday morning.
[197:48.16]That's the way that you'll see the world.
[197:51.16]You're going to be like, what the fuck?
[197:52.50]What are you doing to me?
[197:53.84]I'm trying to sleep.
[197:54.72]I need complete silence.
[197:56.34]And I need nobody talking.
[197:57.48]And I don't want any lights on.
[198:01.78]Alright, let's see if we can... Now I'm even more fucking on edge than I was before.
[198:05.61]It didn't help.
[198:06.47]At all.
[198:10.83]I just like burped.
[198:19.86]Where is my meditation?
[198:25.62]I just had it.
[198:26.54]Where is it?
[198:27.16]It's on a different window.
[198:28.24]What the fuck is this window?
[198:30.01]Why is it down here?
[198:32.68]Help me, come on.
[198:33.98]Find its best way to let go naturally.
[198:38.46]You don't need to relax.
[198:40.86]It may be that your body needs to heal in other ways.
[198:45.50]It's good to know that your unconscious mind is an expert in healing and balancing in a safe and natural way.
[198:59.01]While you can just flow with the experience.
[199:07.52]Change.
[199:08.66]It's a natural aspect of life.
[199:11.78]Like a tree.
[199:12.80]Turn this shit off.
[199:15.44]The seasons.
[199:16.62]Stop it.
[199:18.30]The sea.
[199:19.66]Let me fucking relax.
[199:21.34]To air.
[199:24.46]That guy just made me so fucking angry.
[199:27.13]Imagine now that you're breathing in that life energy.
[199:49.30]Electrician found him like this.
[199:50.96]He must have been taken here.
[199:52.78]Found cut marks around his wrists and ankles.
[199:54.66]Death by strangulation.
[199:57.04]The killer gutted him post-mortem.
[199:59.12]Thank God.
[200:00.65]Thank God.
[200:01.35]Anything else?
[200:02.43]Yeah, seems like the killer may have robbed him unlike previous victories.
[200:07.15]Uh, not victories.
[200:10.35]Couldn't find the kid's wallet.
[200:15.48]What happened to someone else?
[200:16.38]People have no morals these days.
[200:21.85]They'll have to run as Prince fucking god damn it.
[200:24.43]I'm on... I'm off completely right now.
[200:31.33]I'm gonna head back to the office.
[200:32.33]It's been a rough night.
[200:33.19]And I'm about to get... It's gonna get even harder.
[200:35.15]This is ruining the game for me.
[200:37.27]I'm too angry.
[200:38.31]Just too hard.
[200:38.93]Oh, it's gonna get so much worse.
[200:42.82]I'll let you know if we find anything else.
[200:44.02]Alright.
[200:50.13]Why does that guy have that move?
[200:51.19]Why does that guy die?
[200:52.81]Why does that guy die in one hit?
[200:59.42]The same people who make this game?
[201:01.00]This is a great song.
[201:15.65]Chicken delivery.
[201:18.67]Hey guys, just got the masks we ordered.
[201:22.23]Pretty cool, eh?
[201:27.06]They're all chickens.
[201:27.80]Well, how do they feel?
[201:28.62]You like them?
[201:31.80]Guys?
[201:34.30]I'm not sure I feel them.
[201:45.33]I'll get it!
[201:45.73]Hey, none of these phones are ringing.
[202:14.98]Sorry, it's me.
[202:16.92]When did you get a cell phone?
[202:18.10]I took it from that guy we clocked at the bar.
[202:21.79]Just charged it up this morning at Dean's place.
[202:23.75]What should I do?
[202:24.39]Do I answer?
[202:24.93]I don't see any reason not to.
[202:26.71]Alright, here goes nothing.
[202:30.23]Hi, it's me.
[202:31.13]I know you wanted out and I respect that, but I just figured I'd give you a call and see if you've changed your mind.
[202:35.99]You wouldn't believe what's been going on the last few weeks.
[202:43.48]That was just one of those outdoor frog sounds you hear at night in the fall.
[202:47.30]We're calling the shots now.
[202:48.42]Top of the game.
[202:48.98]No one can touch us.
[202:50.62]The new product is in full-scale production.
[202:52.18]Get a new place.
[202:54.04]Three floors up on Northwest 20th Street.
[202:56.48]Who would have thought?
[203:00.08]Why don't you swing on by and check it out, huh?
[203:02.12]Hello?
[203:02.66]Anyone there?
[203:03.44]Click.
[203:05.10]Hey guys, I think I just found something to do tonight.
[203:07.18]Let's go right now.
[203:08.00]I'll tell you all about it in the van.
[203:11.96]Okay.
[203:13.96]What's somebody saying?
[203:14.82]Somebody saying the hardest level in the game?
[203:16.24]Coming up?
[203:16.98]Best song in the game coming up.
[203:19.62]Oh.
[203:22.94]Death Wish.
[203:28.61]Can you open the door already?
[203:29.45]It's getting pretty late.
[203:30.47]They might be heading out soon.
[203:32.39]It was your idea to stake the place out for two hours.
[203:35.01]I'm working as fast as I can.
[203:37.68]Well, we couldn't just barge in.
[203:38.98]You gotta have a plan, you know.
[203:40.14]At least now we know where they are.
[203:43.24]Dot, dot, dot.
[203:44.32]Just fucking open this thing, will ya?
[203:46.82]Maybe you would like to take it over then.
[203:49.50]I'm sure you'd get it open in no use.
[203:52.74]Yeah, I didn't think so.
[203:54.18]I think I got it now.
[203:56.54]Alright, see you guys on the roof.
[203:58.60]Don't forget to stay in touch with the walkie-talkies about the roof.
[204:02.14]You sure will be able to jump across to the other building.
[204:05.82]It looked a bit far to me.
[204:08.24]It's not that far.
[204:09.00]Well, at least not for the rest of us.
[204:12.09]Damn, listen to this.
[204:12.89]You may have some difficulties with it though, big guy.
[204:15.85]Yeah, fuck you too.
[204:21.18]Restart it.
[204:21.60]I didn't mean to do that.
[204:28.16]See you on the roof.
[204:31.49]Let's go.
[204:32.75]Bingo.
[204:33.13]I'm ready.
[204:33.43]I don't know if this detail is going to be hard.
[204:34.85]I'm fucking putting my game hands on.
[204:37.17]Hold on.
[204:41.16]There's one glove.
[204:42.70]You can tell because of the slap.
[204:44.24]Oh, the surgical glove.
[204:45.76]Okay.
[204:57.15]That guy wasn't... That guy was alive.
[205:39.73]What the hell is this?
[205:50.91]I didn't do the cool thing.
[205:52.29]I just T-posed.
[205:55.25]Jesus!
[206:20.52]Who's left?
[206:21.02]Anybody else?
[206:22.62]Okay.
[206:28.17]Two guys on that side.
[206:30.17]Nobody left in this room, so I'm safe to stand here.
[206:32.07]So I've got a guy with a melee.
[206:33.17]I'm going to go top right.
[206:34.09]Can he aim down through here?
[206:37.99]Through the window?
[206:38.75]I don't think I can get him from here.
[206:43.74]Shit, oh god, the fucking windows.
[206:47.88]Oh, I'm so sick of the windows, man.
[207:12.57]Damn.
[207:12.83]I'm gonna try going down.
[207:15.27]Alright, forget about these guys right now.
[207:22.18]I'm gonna get these guys through the window.
[207:23.22]Alright, give me another gun.
[207:33.83]I'm safe to go in here and shoot these guys now.
[207:36.09]But I'm gonna do it through the window.
[207:45.97]Fuck.
[207:53.01]Oh, come on, Jeremy.
[207:54.81]Really?
[207:55.33]He's coming down here.
[207:56.71]Where is he?
[207:57.03]He's coming down here.
[208:00.19]Die!
[208:13.37]Got it.
[208:13.61]Okay.
[208:15.84]I'm down here, heading upstairs.
[208:20.08]Next part, let's go.
[208:22.20]One, two... Didn't know you were up there.
[208:30.01]Look at that gun.
[208:49.66]Two melee.
[208:53.32]Holy fuck!
[208:54.80]Okay.
[208:55.70]Jeez.
[208:56.98]Um... I was like, it's gone?
[209:09.80]Window, of course.
[209:12.86]Window, of course!
[209:21.55]You got to be kidding me, sir!
[209:26.33]My god!
[209:27.29]That instant bug-like reaction time.
[209:34.86]Where is this other dude?
[209:36.00]Is he all the way up there?
[209:43.16]No windows here.
[209:45.00]It's safe to go up here.
[209:45.92]I can see that they're all dead.
[209:48.88]No windows.
[209:51.49]Up and in.
[209:54.27]Nobody else alive.
[209:54.97]Alright, give me a new gun.
[209:57.31]There's windows.
[209:58.35]What do I do?
[209:59.86]I'm freezing.
[210:00.20]I'm panicking.
[210:00.52]I'm frozen.
[210:04.28]I'm frozen.
[210:04.64]What do I do?
[210:05.14]Alright, I'm gonna go back down.
[210:13.37]This is it.
[210:14.01]Just this room.
[210:15.37]And there's a dog up here.
[210:17.61]Get rid of that dog first.
[210:23.25]Alright, only one way in this room.
[210:30.47]You stupid game!
[210:31.65]God damn it, come on!
[210:36.50]God, man, why did that happen?
[210:40.78]Fucking hell.
[210:43.56]Shit, that was the end too.
[210:45.06]Come on, this is so hard.
[210:48.08]Those guys can't be stopped.
[210:50.60]Oh, I'm actually angry right now.
[210:55.88]I was backpedaling, but I got stuck on a couch!
[211:02.43]Those guys have to die.
[211:03.53]You have to focus those people.
[211:07.11]Because if those people... Fuck me.
[211:15.88]I was so close, too.
[211:17.86]They just never stop running at you.
[211:20.87]You have to shoot him with a shotgun.
[211:22.33]I'm not gonna go in that other room unless I have a shotgun.
[211:25.49]I promise you guys.
[211:33.58]Just the slightest, little, miniscule, tiny, teeny mistake and the whole thing is over.
[211:41.54]Oh, it's so stressful.
[211:46.68]No, there's no, absolutely no mistakes are allowed to be made.
[211:50.76]Damn it.
[212:01.61]I went in here first last time.
[212:02.79]Alright, shotgun this dude.
[212:10.58]Has to be a shotgun.
[212:11.66]I can't let those guys just fucking chase me around a room and not die.
[212:22.57]There's a guy right up fucking there.
[212:26.82]Jesus.
[212:33.16]That's not a knife?
[212:33.90]What?
[212:36.78]Is this not a knife?
[212:39.46]Have I lost my mind?
[212:40.42]That's not a knife.
[212:41.34]What?
[212:41.54]Let's try this again.
[212:55.13]I can't see that far.
[213:05.07]God damn it.
[213:11.17]Oh, man.
[213:13.09]But is there somebody still up there?
[213:16.26]I can't see.
[213:19.18]Okay, no.
[213:20.42]For the future, if I die again, there's only one guy that's up there.
[213:40.34]Make sure I have a shotgun.
[213:44.96]I believe that's it.
[213:45.70]It's just that room now.
[213:49.98]Alright, no, no, no.
[213:52.86]There's a guy over there.
[213:53.62]It's alright.
[213:53.96]Give me a shotgun.
[213:54.72]Is there a shotgun?
[213:57.20]Looking for a shotgun.
[213:58.56]Okay, here's one right here.
[214:00.24]Plant it right in his head.
[214:04.50]Got it.
[214:04.92]Okay.
[214:05.86]Now...
[214:09.97]Oh, fuck, a guy's coming.
[214:15.67]Which way is he going?
[214:16.81]HOLY SHIT, THERE'S A DOG!
[214:18.58]WHAT, THAT GUY TURNED INTO A DOG!
[214:21.00]THAT GUY TURNED INTO A DOG!
[214:31.19]Why?
[214:31.87]Where was the dog?
[214:38.23]Give me a break.
[214:41.10]How?
[214:44.14]A guy runs out of the room and all of a sudden a dog is running after me.
[214:47.84]I can't even believe it.
[214:52.24]That guy was a fucking werewolf.
[214:53.72]I'm getting a fucking break, man.
[215:12.70]I can't even fucking believe it.
[215:18.77]That's un-fucking-believable.
[215:29.10]Got the guy up there.
[215:29.86]Where the fuck did- who are you guys?
[215:48.19]I didn't even know I had the fucking roll.
[215:50.48]I keep forgetting that it's in this game.
[215:56.98]And great, you came out this time.
[215:58.48]Nice.
[215:59.04]The one time you ever opened that door.
[216:08.72]The whole game is running after me now.
[216:15.44]Anybody else running after me?
[216:23.31]Who the fuck was that guy?
[216:24.69]Who the fuck was this guy?
[216:26.81]What the hell was that?
[216:29.91]One of the guys on the ground was not dead.
[216:31.99]What the fuck just happened?
[216:45.60]Oh, I'm losing it here.
[216:53.87]There's one way I can do this, there's a way I was doing it before.
[217:18.52]I'm so fucked.
[217:28.47]How are you reliably supposed to go in this room?
[217:33.10]Isn't a part of this game about going really fast?
[217:35.50]How would you ever do it in this room?
[217:38.02]You have to wait until they get in a certain spot where you can get them both, right?
[217:42.21]Do I have to dodge roll around them?
[217:46.07]What are the iframes like in dodge?
[217:50.41]Okay, that's kind of a huge deal.
[217:55.40]I didn't even know there were iframes.
[217:59.42]That changes a lot.
[218:17.51]God, come on!
[218:25.79]No, I'm... I gotta just focus on beating him.
[218:28.53]I'm not gonna do the dodge roll and shit.
[218:30.23]Not now.
[218:30.57]It's way too late for me to learn how to do that right now.
[218:52.00]Alright, I need another gun.
[218:53.48]Try it again.
[218:59.48]The dodge rolling sucks in this game.
[219:00.88]I mean, I don't know.
[219:04.66]I feel like it's gonna cause more problems if I try to use it.
[219:13.81]Did I kill the guy up here?
[219:14.83]Okay, I did.
[219:22.95]Alright, one, two, this one guy right here.
[219:27.51]Holy shit, okay.
[219:31.70]A guy patrols in that room.
[219:35.24]So... That guy will kill me.
[219:37.70]Okay, shoot him.
[219:38.54]Did I get him?
[219:46.37]I don't think I did.
[219:52.21]No, he's right there.
[219:54.09]Oh my fucking god, a goddamn computer!
[219:57.30]I shot the computer!
[219:59.71]I shot the compu- calm down.
[220:08.72]Need a gun.
[220:24.00]Oh my fucking god, give me a break.
[220:39.10]You've got to be kidding me.
[221:10.06]The worst part is just not being able to see down here, you know what I mean?
[221:12.86]It's just like, taking a guess.
[221:16.64]When do I unlock the guy with the mask that you can see further?
[221:18.95]There's a fucking door.
[221:36.19]You don't get it in this game.
[221:39.41]Okay.
[221:46.72]There's a dog.
[221:47.24]I need a weapon.
[221:55.42]Where's that dog?
[221:59.02]I gotta find that dog now.
[222:00.96]Alright, he's in that room.
[222:06.65]He's over here.
[222:07.15]He's sniffing me out.
[222:08.61]This dog is sniffing me out right now.
[222:11.33]I gotta get rid of him now.
[222:14.56]Alright, that was one of the- I'm like bumping the microphone.
[222:16.90]I'm so fucking on edge.
[222:20.89]Don't know where the hell you came from, but that's fine.
[222:24.55]Alright, back around.
[222:38.37]Where's this guy?
[222:42.91]Where the fuck is he?
[222:44.29]No, he's going to come around this way, isn't he?
[222:46.93]I don't know.
[222:47.47]I can't see.
[222:48.33]I can't see where he is.
[222:50.91]I'm like trapped right here.
[223:11.18]Dog.
[223:17.40]I didn't even know you could... I forgot you could go through that way.
[223:19.38]Alright, I'm almost done.
[223:25.78]Way to go.
[223:30.04]Last guy.
[223:33.04]He's over there, and there's nobody else, right?
[223:35.10]I think that's it, and I'm pretty sure I'm out of here after this.
[223:39.66]No.
[223:47.25]Where's this fucking hidden person?
[223:52.65]Oh, they're down there.
[223:53.36]Oh, no!
[223:55.12]No, I'm so scared.
[223:57.68]Give me a gun.
[223:58.28]I need a gun with a lot of bullets.
[224:01.44]This'll do.
[224:01.90]It's just two, but I have to go all the way around and down.
[224:08.46]But what if they see me?
[224:09.80]They're gonna shoot me from a hundred miles away because I can't see where they are.
[224:18.19]You understand?
[224:18.85]Like, how the fuck?
[224:37.28]Fucking God.
[224:38.10]Get me out of here.
[224:41.14]I think I'm done here.
[224:41.96]How are you guys doing?
[224:45.05]There's more.
[224:45.63]There's another one.
[224:46.29]There's a whole other floor.
[224:47.33]Alright, this is punch time.
[224:48.63]Oh, okay, you can... Alright, that's two punches.
[225:03.57]Well, you have a gun.
[225:16.12]Come on in.
[225:16.64]I'll take you all.
[225:19.18]Guy with a gun right there.
[225:20.30]Alright, he's at the window.
[225:21.53]Let me get this guy first.
[225:22.31]Okay, no guns, right?
[225:34.79]Only guy with a gun is over there.
[225:36.64]Window's here, though.
[225:37.44]Where's the guy with a gun?
[225:38.62]Up there.
[225:39.16]Oh, come on.
[225:42.84]The out-of-line-of-sight guys with guns across the map.
[225:47.43]It's starting to become tiring.
[226:06.48]What the fuck?
[226:09.26]How am I gonna kill this guy?
[226:12.44]Uh... How am I gonna kill this guy?
[226:16.50]What the fuck are you supposed to do about that guy?
[226:19.02]Punch him through the window?
[226:19.92]Oh my lord.
[226:57.34]I gotta get rid of this guy.
[227:00.10]Use the gun?
[227:00.56]I can't.
[227:00.92]This character cannot use weapons.
[227:09.25]Another guy with a gun.
[227:14.42]Alright, so that's that.
[227:16.98]Any more windows?
[227:18.30]Yeah, plenty of them.
[227:21.20]Okay.
[227:30.00]God, we're from here down?
[227:31.06]No, I... Let me take a good look at this.
[227:37.74]So, there's tons of people with guns.
[227:41.22]There's only one way to get in here.
[227:42.93]I have to go all the way down and around.
[227:45.97]That's the only way I can get in there.
[227:47.31]So I have to go down here.
[227:50.31]Okay, can I like... Can I get them to run this way?
[227:57.03]I don't think so, I have to bait them.
[227:59.86]This is gonna be a pain in the ass.
[228:10.06]Alright, one more guy with a gun.
[228:11.72]Watch out for that dumb window!
[228:13.26]No, not a window!
[228:21.80]Am I safe if I run up there?
[228:22.96]No, he's got a gun.
[228:28.38]So if he... Okay, if I walk over here and these guys see me shoot through, but if I run up to this room, this guy will shoot me.
[228:37.48]I wonder if I can bait them.
[228:45.51]Okay, got one.
[228:55.53]Holy shit!
[228:56.79]Oh my god, my body just... My whole body hurts.
[229:00.47]That hurt.
[229:01.49]That actually hurt.
[229:06.55]Okay, just this one guy.
[229:08.49]But, I gotta bait this guy, because if I run up there, I gotta make sure he comes over here.
[229:11.88]Come here.
[229:12.54]Alright, here we go.
[229:13.92]One punch.
[229:18.06]Last guy.
[229:27.77]No, that's not the last guy.
[229:29.71]Oh... Cheesing the level?
[229:40.18]How the hell are you supposed to do this on your first try?
[229:42.76]Never playing the game before.
[229:44.54]How the fuck else are you supposed to do this?
[230:11.73]God damn, get me out of this.
[230:13.15]Don't get me out of here.
[230:17.44]I think I heard something.
[230:18.16]Alright, fine.
[230:20.00]Finally!
[230:38.47]Can you get the door out of the way?
[230:40.24]Why?
[230:45.30]Really?
[230:47.27]You're like fucking hack accuracy?
[230:50.21]That's great.
[231:12.65]Hmm... What the fuck, man?
[231:25.60]That's such bullshit.
[231:29.72]Honest to God.
[231:31.26]Oh, that's so infuriating!
[232:03.94]How did he not get cut?
[232:04.78]Dude, I hate the doors.
[232:12.50]The doors just make the enemies fall down and makes it harder to kill.
[232:40.53]He's left.
[232:41.57]The whole second part of the level.
[232:45.79]And I don't understand where he even came from.
[232:49.01]I just looked over there.
[232:50.41]I just checked.
[233:01.90]He's not even dead.
[233:12.93]I wish you could just shoot him on the ground.
[233:14.53]I really do.
[233:52.73]Ah, somebody heard it.
[233:53.47]I'm dead.
[233:54.50]I'm so dead.
[233:59.00]Hold on, I pressed the razor button.
[234:00.94]Sorry, I pressed it twice apparently.
[234:11.47]Why waste bullets when you can hit space and kill them for free?
[234:13.27]Because the animation takes like six seconds to kill them.
[234:15.93]That's why.
[234:21.02]When they're lying on the ground and I put space on them, it's like a full animation.
[234:42.10]okay what's down there got any guns down there two guns uh I'm going back up because I think I got the dog on me
[235:14.96]They've been coming all the way around the whole game.
[235:16.78]Oh my goodness.
[235:35.37]Actually, I want to... Let me drag the whole fucking level over here.
[235:38.62]Seriously.
[235:39.12]I'd rather just sit over here.
[235:42.68]It's so difficult to even get out there and even take two steps forward.
[235:46.42]I mean, I just, I wish I could see further.
[235:48.48]Like, ugh.
[236:07.10]That's it.
[236:07.50]Here comes the dog.
[236:13.20]All the way around the whole game.
[236:14.54]Come on, all the way around.
[236:15.60]Come on, dog.
[236:18.02]Start from here and make it all the way over.
[236:19.20]You know exactly where I was.
[236:20.88]You can smell me, right?
[236:29.44]See, my problem is just... Walking down this hallway, I might just fucking die instantly by somebody that's over here.
[236:55.69]Hotline Miami 2 in a nutshell?
[237:32.95]Why?
[237:34.51]Oh my god.
[237:45.63]Dog hear that?
[237:47.05]Bring him on over here.
[237:49.42]Oh no, come on.
[237:51.12]Bring the pets and the friends.
[238:01.88]Ah, I can't even go over here!
[238:12.89]Shoot, but I don't want to shoot because I don't want to bring everybody else over here right now.
[238:21.51]Ah!
[238:27.69]See, here's the issue.
[238:28.57]Again, here's the same issue from before.
[238:32.32]Am I just gonna step out and die?
[238:33.34]I don't know.
[238:38.23]I have to go this way.
[238:39.13]There's no other way to go.
[238:40.05]So I have to, like, sneak in this room and not die.
[238:42.45]Go.
[238:42.61]There's a guy right there.
[238:46.03]Okay.
[238:58.38]Here come the two guys with the guns.
[239:00.96]I don't want to shoot here because it'll pull everybody and it'll be a mess.
[239:13.52]Fuck.
[239:14.08]I can't see.
[239:15.27]Did they move?
[239:15.93]Here they are.
[239:16.35]I'm going to follow them.
[239:22.01]He's dead.
[239:22.33]He's dead.
[239:22.59]He's dead.
[239:23.55]Holy shit.
[239:24.31]I just turned and clicked and spam clicked.
[239:35.84]Fuck, man!
[239:36.80]This is so ridiculous!
[239:38.34]I know I could do it a different way, but I don't care.
[239:48.88]How did he not shoot me?
[239:49.88]Why did you not shoot me?
[239:51.04]Why?
[239:51.28]Thank God!
[239:51.98]Why did you not shoot me?
[239:59.57]But... Oh no!
[240:08.64]He fucking was behind him.
[240:10.66]Oh man, I would classify this game as extreme difficulty.
[240:16.67]I've played Dark Souls, I've played Demon's Souls, I've played them all.
[240:20.63]I would put this one under the category of like, holy fuck difficulty.
[240:26.42]This is extreme.
[240:28.00]This is extreme difficulty.
[240:32.90]And there's a hard mode, holy shit.
[240:34.86]How do you even play that one?
[240:36.34]How do you even do that?
[240:47.99]I can't believe there's a hard difficulty here.
[240:49.73]How the hell, how does that even work?
[240:51.03]You die in one hit anyways.
[241:03.49]I fucking panicked.
[241:18.28]How do you make this game harder?
[241:19.40]You add enemies?
[241:24.85]What's the hard mode?
[241:26.51]Guns have half as many bullets and there's more enemies.
[241:38.12]They're coming.
[241:39.70]I saw them.
[241:44.33]How did that not cut through them both?
[242:07.04]Oh my god.
[242:08.32]Oh my god.
[242:35.09]You have to be a corner creep in this game.
[242:36.69]Did you have to do that in the last one?
[242:38.06]You didn't do this in the last game.
[242:39.36]You didn't have to, like, shoot a wall and bait a hundred enemies that have guns.
[242:43.26]I don't remember that happening in the last one.
[242:45.25]I just played it two days ago.
[243:17.31]Oh, fuck.
[243:31.30]Dog.
[243:31.66]Come on up here, dog.
[243:32.64]Come on.
[243:44.50]It's just a guy with a bat.
[243:47.16]Jesus Christ.
[243:48.84]Okay.
[243:56.67]I need another bullet.
[243:57.99]I need another gun.
[243:58.55]Give me that gun.
[244:05.63]That was a mistake.
[244:06.21]Okay.
[244:26.33]What are you doing over there?
[244:26.97]Get over here.
[244:28.37]He's not hearing that?
[244:34.95]Why are you not hearing this?
[244:39.92]Oh.
[244:44.84]Oh.
[244:50.17]Just shoot.
[244:50.79]I...
[245:07.90]My goodness.
[245:14.13]To the roof.
[245:18.15]We're on the roof.
[245:18.75]How are things going for you guys?
[245:20.51]Hello?
[245:21.76]Is anyone there?
[245:22.60]Guys!
[245:25.42]They're not answering.
[245:26.92]Maybe your walkie-talkie's busted.
[245:31.66]I don't think so.
[245:32.18]It seems to be working just fine.
[245:34.27]Should we go back and check on them?
[245:52.41]What the fuck are you waiting for?
[246:05.92]Wait, do I not have access to those two characters?
[246:07.52]They're like my favorite characters in the game.
[246:11.11]I'm not gonna get D. C. Why is it always the level... The levels that take me 40 minutes and make me the most angry, I get C's on them.
[246:21.86]Hey, but to be fair, let me give myself a little bit of credit here.
[246:24.08]40 minutes is the cap, man.
[246:26.77]That's like the hard cap before I hit my enrage timer.
[246:29.73]Don't you understand?
[246:32.29]And then it's just, I beat it.
[246:41.98]Hey, you're not supposed to be here.
[246:42.88]We've got this under control.
[246:50.76]Sure looks like it.
[246:51.33]I'll take over from here.
[246:54.13]You can't do that.
[246:55.61]Just watch me.
[247:07.15]That level was the pinwheel of Hotline Miami 2.
[247:09.35]That's bullshit.
[247:10.81]And you all know it.
[247:12.53]It's fucking hard.
[247:13.57]And the game is, the game is... Start quote.
[247:20.64]Tough as nails, top-down shooter that will really test your patience.
[247:24.86]End quote.
[247:28.46]What do we have here?
[247:29.06]We're in Mass.
[247:29.54]Another set of Vigilantics, I presume.
[247:32.37]Don't shoot, I give up, I'm through with this.
[247:34.95]Just arrest me and get this over with, okay?
[247:41.83]I'm done fighting.
[247:43.49]Oh, you want your 15 minutes of fame?
[247:44.85]Well, I don't think so.
[247:49.48]You know what happens to thugs like you?
[247:55.86]That's what happens!
[248:02.20]Are you alright, sir?
[248:03.14]What happened in there?
[248:06.70]He came at me.
[248:07.30]Had to take him out.
[248:08.02]It was him or me.
[248:08.68]That's not even true.
[248:18.91]Looks like my job here is done.
[248:19.99]I'll leave the rest up to you.
[248:28.30]Okay, bye.
[248:34.46]That's it?
[248:35.50]That's it, apparently.
[248:36.24]Okay.
[248:39.86]Fourth act.
[248:40.72]Falling.
[248:41.25]Falling.
[248:52.94]Oh, what?
[248:54.76]So all the animals are gone.
[248:59.76]Good morning, honey.
[249:00.40]I didn't want to wake you.
[249:02.02]Took Jimmy to school, left you some breakfast.
[249:03.70]See you tonight.
[249:04.24]Love, Sharon.
[249:12.91]Okay.
[249:16.77]Like, yeah, I'm having trouble following the story here.
[249:19.83]We have, like, a Kingdom Hearts level of shit going on.
[249:27.80]Hey, mister.
[249:28.48]Spare some change?
[249:31.09]Sure, here you go.
[249:36.69]Do I look like I want your dirty money?
[249:39.71]Excuse me?
[249:41.15]We've barely got enough money for rent.
[249:43.53]Maybe you should stop trying to be a writer.
[249:46.69]We've got kids to feed.
[249:48.64]We need a real job, dear.
[249:51.04]This just isn't working.
[249:53.30]Sharon, what's going on here?
[249:55.55]I'll leave you.
[249:56.19]I'll take the kids and leave.
[249:57.79]You won't have to do that.
[249:58.71]This book, it's gonna be good, I promise.
[250:01.03]I need more time.
[250:03.59]Time is the one thing you don't have.
[250:05.53]Maybe you should reconsider your priorities.
[250:09.02]What are you saying?
[250:11.28]I said I don't want your stinking money.
[250:21.20]Organization 13!
[250:21.76]Uh-huh!
[250:29.77]Ooh, I thought we were still on the subway!
[250:31.55]What?!
[250:37.40]Well, this is one of those missions where I can't kill anybody.
[250:41.40]It's one of those.
[250:51.28]Guns.
[250:53.76]Guns!
[250:56.71]And why would you stop there?
[250:58.30]Why did you stop there?
[250:59.36]You saw where I went.
[251:00.42]Why would you freeze there?
[251:42.40]Where did you even come from?!
[251:58.93]Green Goblin.
[252:00.18]That's fine.
[252:00.80]You can call me whatever you want.
[252:02.66]But what the hell?
[252:03.62]I'm trying to get this guy to bait over to me.
[252:07.82]And he just won't do it.
[252:09.72]He just won't do it.
[252:33.37]Guy with a gun?
[252:33.81]A fucking guy with a gun!
[252:41.86]There's another guy right here, coming over, come on.
[252:54.20]I got stuck on a fucking wall.
[253:02.15]Kill the guys on the ground.
[253:05.33]I thought I'm not supposed to do that.
[253:08.21]Wasn't I specifically not supposed to do that?
[253:17.09]Yeah, what are you... You're trying to bait me into doing something I'm not supposed to do.
[253:23.15]Really?
[253:23.39]Alright, I got it.
[253:32.17]Don't let yourself succumb to the hate.
[253:34.21]I'm not, I'm alright.
[253:41.36]I can't walk through this?
[253:44.10]Oh, there's a very- you have to go the right way, I get it.
[253:52.04]Windows, oh god.
[253:56.33]Alright, this guy's... Everybody pretty much has a gun in that room.
[254:00.15]So if I'm gonna bait people, it needs to be these guys up here.
[254:09.59]Maybe not.
[254:10.05]What's down here?
[254:11.35]Nothing?
[254:12.07]Alright, there's a safe spot over here.
[254:13.23]Alright, what about... Is there any... They can come through there.
[254:23.08]They're already aiming over here.
[254:35.13]I don't know what's up here.
[254:42.34]Give me a break.
[254:42.82]I probably did it too and I clicked it and I fucking clicked it.
[254:52.81]What happened there?
[254:53.57]What happened there twice?
[254:54.83]Two times.
[254:55.72]Twice.
[254:56.44]Two.
[254:57.36]Two times.
[255:17.39]Alright, there's three guys.
[255:21.20]Where's this other guy going?
[255:22.10]I don't want to go through the turnstile.
[255:43.60]Now he can see me from there!
[255:47.97]Get the fuck out of my life.
[255:54.05]Heh heh heh.
[255:55.47]This is our turf now boys, let's tear it up!
[256:00.91]Who the fuck was that?
[256:04.32]Okay, well, is somebody in like a mech suit up here?
[256:10.68]Okay, well we're gonna have to run him around.
[256:18.27]Oh, he's... he's attracting them.
[256:20.03]I get it.
[256:25.53]I get it.
[256:26.73]Who's left?
[256:46.08]Oh, shit!
[257:02.44]Where is he doing that?
[257:04.70]Where is he doing that shit?
[257:07.08]Is there another guy with a gun up here?
[257:21.30]Where is he?
[257:28.64]Alright, that one was not nearly as bad as the last one.
[257:40.17]He was building a sentry.
[257:52.29]He's gonna find rage mode soon.
[257:54.33]I... I'm sorry I couldn't get the door for you.
[258:02.65]My legs aren't what they used to be.
[258:04.27]You're that writer who called earlier, right?
[258:06.10]That's right, ma'am.
[258:10.35]I was hoping you could tell me a bit about your son.
[258:13.17]He was the sweetest child.
[258:14.31]I don't know how he got mixed up in that mess.
[258:18.04]I'm sure it must have come as a shock to you.
[258:20.26]Yes, well, I noticed that he was behaving differently.
[258:22.46]He was always a bit of a loner, you see.
[258:24.68]Suddenly he was going out to meet old friends.
[258:26.28]I never knew he had any.
[258:27.96]I didn't think much of it.
[258:28.84]A man that age shouldn't be alone all the time.
[258:31.45]I always felt I was holding him back.
[258:33.51]He was taking care of me, you see.
[258:35.54]Did he tell you anything about what happened?
[258:37.94]I only visited him a couple of times when he was in prison.
[258:40.76]He wouldn't tell me a thing about it.
[258:42.16]Said it was better if I didn't know.
[258:43.38]Have any idea what happened to him after he made his escape?
[258:48.91]Has he been in contact with you?
[258:51.35]Well, I can't really talk about that now, can I?
[258:55.01]Look, I just really would like to talk to him.
[258:59.20]Well, if he does call, I could maybe give him your number.
[259:02.04]That way he can decide for himself if he'd like to talk to you or not.
[259:06.30]sounds more than fair thank you while I'm here I'd like to ask you if it's okay to have a look around please do it's upstairs on the left that's my son's room I've kept it just the way it is that the way they left it okay what about like in the trash all the tvs flicker okay
[259:41.03]March 10th.
[259:41.93]March 16th.
[259:42.75]Hmm.
[259:46.73]Dot, dot, dot, dot.
[259:55.74]Doesn't remember CRTs.
[259:57.04]Yeah, I do.
[260:02.94]Crystal Retina Televisions.
[260:04.12]Alright.
[260:09.03]The end.
[260:11.17]I beat the game.
[260:18.35]So we're watching tapes?
[260:23.34]Who's watching the tapes?
[260:27.54]I've been thinking.
[260:28.44]Oh yeah, thinking about what?
[260:29.84]When I get back home, I think I want to open up a bar.
[260:33.72]Oh, you do like drinking.
[260:36.08]Hey, I'm being serious.
[260:36.70]You think it's a bad idea?
[260:37.46]I used to work as a bartender.
[260:40.61]What are you going to do when you get back?
[260:42.87]I'm a teacher, remember?
[260:43.95]I have a job when I get back.
[260:46.37]I'm sure you'd make a great bar owner though, Barnes.
[260:49.53]Who wouldn't want to have a sociopathic drunk as their boss?
[260:54.14]Yeah, fuck you too.
[260:55.82]How about you, Lieutenant?
[260:56.84]Got any plans?
[260:58.88]I'm not sure.
[260:59.74]The bar sounds nice.
[261:02.86]Anything where I won't have to carry a gun and shoot people.
[261:05.94]Maybe I'll find a little convenience store or something.
[261:09.43]Put a little TV next to the register, just sit there all day relaxing.
[261:15.47]Sounds like you've got it all planned out.
[261:18.02]I try not to think about it too much.
[261:19.76]This is where he quits the game?
[261:23.90]Things never turn out the way you expect them to.
[261:27.08]Anyway, I'm gonna go see what's keeping the Colonel.
[261:29.88]This is where I quit the game.
[261:31.78]It's really bad.
[261:38.07]Oh, alright, now I'm ready.
[261:40.58]I'm ready for it.
[261:41.74]Jerma, you will quit this.
[261:48.54]The armory levels are ridiculous.
[261:51.41]Okay, we were supposed to move.
[261:53.09]I'm gonna give it a try.
[261:56.11]Sun's been up for an hour now.
[262:01.79]Lieutenant, I just received some good news.
[262:03.21]Looks like I might be promoted.
[262:04.47]They're considering me for Lieutenant General.
[262:07.14]You don't look too happy about it, sir.
[262:08.38]It's something troubling you.
[262:10.50]Now can't you see I'm celebrating?
[262:12.38]Why wouldn't I want to be Lieutenant General?
[262:14.10]Well, besides the fact that we're going to lose this war.
[262:17.71]On a more positive note, you and the boys are being sent back home soon.
[262:20.54]Unfortunately, we've got one more mission before that.
[262:23.70]The hardest one of the game?
[262:25.16]The one you briefed us about last night?
[262:27.36]That's the one charging an enemy camp with just four soldiers.
[262:31.28]Good thing you're an elite unit, huh?
[262:32.90]What a piece of shit mission.
[262:34.84]Even he's ready for it.
[262:36.12]Nothing good about it, son.
[262:37.24]You boys stay frosty.
[262:38.97]Don't get yourself killed for nothing, you hear?
[262:41.61]Yes, sir.
[262:42.47]Alright.
[262:43.09]Godspeed.
[263:02.44]Oh, I need to pick a gun.
[263:10.91]I don't know.
[263:11.57]If this is one of the hardest missions in the game, I have to be prepared.
[263:16.25]I'm taking the super machine gun.
[263:18.74]Fourteenth scene, Stronghold.
[263:20.70]Okay.
[263:24.66]This is what everybody told me.
[263:26.74]I was gonna rage quit at this mission.
[263:28.12]This is the one where I'm going to rage quit, apparently.
[263:29.94]I'm gonna prove you all wrong.
[263:32.17]It's time to prove you wrong.
[263:54.15]Oops.
[264:07.08]Alright, let's take a look.
[264:10.36]I'm gonna go... Alright, there's a big guy.
[264:16.07]And we've got these windows here.
[264:18.83]Grabbing a gun.
[264:26.59]Can I not pull?
[264:27.25]Because I don't need it.
[264:38.92]Careful with the ammo, right?
[264:42.26]Alright, got a guy.
[264:43.10]One, two.
[264:45.66]Guy on the left.
[264:46.41]Let's get that guy first.
[264:57.41]Get another good view.
[264:58.43]I can't see that far.
[265:05.16]Wait for him to come down.
[265:07.70]Ooh, there's a guy right there.
[265:11.44]Oh fuck.
[265:15.32]That just scared the shit out of me.
[265:16.64]Okay, I still have bullets.
[265:17.90]Is that guy still gonna see me?
[265:20.96]That guy's gonna see me do this shit.
[265:30.42]Oh no!
[265:41.14]Can't see that far ahead.
[265:42.08]Let's take a look.
[265:49.97]We got a guy with a window.
[265:53.01]I don't see anybody up here.
[265:54.39]I have to get rid of this guy.
[265:59.86]You're not gonna... You don't hear this?
[266:02.40]What's wrong with this dude?
[266:11.56]I only got one bullet.
[266:12.50]Save it.
[266:27.79]Ammo right there.
[266:32.76]Where the fuck is that guy?
[266:33.86]The wee...
[266:44.59]Come get me, come and get me.
[266:52.57]Fuck!
[266:52.99]The door blocked me!
[266:54.25]The door fucked me up again!
[266:56.19]It took the door to fuck it up again.
[267:00.96]Unbelievable.
[267:04.68]Un-fucking-believable, man.
[267:08.20]These doors are so rage-inducing.
[267:14.59]Like, I can't just blow through the fucking door?
[267:17.77]Why?
[267:18.17]It just seems so stupid!
[267:23.43]Like, why can't I just fucking shoot- blow the door off?
[267:26.07]You're telling me a little wooden fucking Minecraft door isn't gonna stop a fucking, like, M16 or whatever the hell this thing is?
[267:37.98]Seriously!
[268:09.02]Still people over here.
[268:09.94]I probably shouldn't.
[268:11.18]Meh, I'm gonna.
[268:12.98]Screw it, whatever.
[268:13.60]Where's the big guy?
[268:19.98]Okay.
[268:25.88]I'm gonna go back down.
[268:35.81]Alright, we got a guy right here.
[268:38.49]Don't let this guy fool me.
[268:57.98]I thought he... I thought I died.
[269:00.11]Okay, what else is up here?
[269:06.02]Another side where... Ah, interesting.
[269:08.64]Okay.
[269:09.60]I gotta get up into the left door here.
[269:11.47]Everyone over there on the right is dead.
[269:12.53]Where'd he go?
[269:30.12]Where'd he go?
[269:30.46]There's another guy.
[269:31.02]Where'd he go?
[269:32.08]There he is.
[269:43.77]Smells like Up Dog in here.
[269:45.77]What is, uh... What's Up Dog?
[269:48.20]I don't know what that is.
[269:49.50]Alright, not yet, not yet, no no no no no.
[269:57.58]Where's the ammo?
[270:00.42]Is there ammo in here that I'm just gonna unload and fill?
[270:07.53]It's up here, right?
[270:14.51]What?
[270:19.81]No!
[270:23.66]I thought I was gonna... Okay, well, whatever.
[270:27.02]That didn't hit you?
[270:42.01]Alright.
[270:42.99]Six bullets.
[270:43.87]Not good.
[270:44.31]I got a guy here.
[270:51.91]Guy there.
[270:56.10]Through the window.
[270:56.84]Watch it.
[270:57.76]There's a lot of windows here.
[271:09.29]Anybody up?
[271:11.31]I can't tell!
[271:12.07]No, there's not.
[271:12.75]Okay, right here.
[271:13.77]That guy's a machete.
[271:21.73]Oh, the fucking tree.
[271:23.05]And this is blocking me.
[271:25.91]Alright, I need ammo.
[271:28.21]Is there a box over here?
[271:31.51]There's no boxes?
[271:32.23]Are the only ammo boxes over there?
[271:34.09]It's right there.
[271:39.04]Fuck.
[271:41.62]Alright, I gotta bait.
[271:46.48]Holy fuck, you almost got me.
[271:47.70]Almost got me!
[271:48.40]Not this time!
[271:50.04]Almost.
[272:00.51]Who's up there?
[272:01.19]Is it the guy with the gun there?
[272:03.43]I gotta go the long way.
[272:07.29]Just in case if somebody's fucking over here, I'm in deep!
[272:09.89]Yes, there is.
[272:12.91]Is that a wall, though?
[272:14.45]Is that a full wall?
[272:15.37]It is.
[272:16.01]Good.
[272:18.69]Last guy.
[272:19.47]Actually, two more guys.
[272:25.34]And then you, but anybody else.
[272:26.70]Check it before you get wrecked.
[272:35.32]Alright, let's go.
[272:49.83]Whoa, you're a guy?
[272:50.91]Okay.
[272:51.39]Yeah, I know that.
[272:52.67]Okay, you saw me.
[272:53.61]I'll give it to you.
[273:06.96]Damn it, I just got so greedy.
[273:20.18]I have to shoot them twice, I'm sorry.
[273:22.14]I know I'm not supposed to.
[273:34.83]What?
[273:35.31]Oh, fuck, they have guns.
[273:36.71]Right.
[273:37.17]I'm an idiot.
[273:51.49]Easy.
[273:55.14]Another guy.
[273:55.56]Where's the other one?
[273:56.88]There's another big fat guy.
[273:57.74]There he is.
[273:58.08]Okay, we're gonna run him all the way around.
[274:03.18]Oh no.
[274:06.27]Fuck.
[274:07.69]I did the same thing again.
[274:08.91]I forgot that anybody can insta-shoot kill you.
[274:15.37]Instantly.
[274:17.53]It doesn't matter.
[274:18.03]They just... And you're dead.
[274:20.81]I forgot.
[274:32.37]That's where I gotta go in here.
[274:47.64]Okay, that's two.
[274:48.92]There's probably another one.
[274:52.94]I did miss one guy over there, but... It's not gonna be a big deal, I don't think.
[274:58.52]I need ammo.
[275:01.60]Where the fuck am I gonna get that?
[275:06.06]Hmm.
[275:08.12]I don't know what's up here.
[275:11.16]Okay, yeah, oh, great, good.
[275:12.94]That, uh, that, keep in mind.
[275:16.15]I was just looking up there.
[275:18.61]I was just up there.
[275:20.13]Just... I was just looking there.
[275:23.61]That's fucking wonderful.
[275:28.32]I can't break.
[275:49.55]I think I pressed the Razor Death Adder button again.
[275:56.32]It's not necessarily the... I mean, these levels... This level is just... I don't know.
[276:00.76]It's stupid.
[276:02.24]But the more important thing, the thing that's really throwing me off is the ground.
[276:07.25]It's almost like hard to see the game.
[276:08.79]Oh, I'm dead.
[276:22.64]You know, it's like the yellow brick road is just fucking messing with my brain.
[276:46.11]Mm, fuck.
[276:50.30]That guy's still alive.
[276:53.84]Why did you get... I don't understand why he got up.
[276:59.53]What made him get up?
[277:00.91]Was he just there?
[277:01.57]I don't understand.
[277:09.68]Um... I'll take it.
[277:12.38]I'll take it.
[277:30.33]Alright.
[277:31.99]No more fat guys.
[277:32.89]Okay.
[277:35.37]Am I gonna walk out here or am I gonna walk down this road?
[277:38.67]Cause... I'm almost out of ammo.
[277:41.79]I think that's ammo down there.
[277:42.81]Okay, here we go.
[277:43.47]Here comes another guy just walking in a circle.
[277:48.90]Alright.
[277:50.64]I'm gonna move.
[277:56.42]Is this an ammo crate?
[277:57.80]I wonder.
[278:06.60]I'm trying not to get sniped.
[278:09.68]Oh my god.
[278:10.34]And I went at the worst possible fucking moment.
[278:14.86]Oh fuck.
[278:17.24]God damn it.
[278:19.38]Just was not fucking far enough away.
[278:21.83]I should have just shot him.
[278:28.87]I don't think I shot him.
[278:38.33]Okay, it is that box.
[278:42.65]He's doing the quitting voice?
[278:43.93]No, I'm doing the like, what the hell is this voice?
[278:48.28]How is this Hotline Miami?
[278:55.20]Yellow Brick Road, wartime.
[279:15.18]Oh god, fuck.
[279:16.28]I thought you had to click it.
[279:35.20]Alright.
[279:36.04]There's another fat guy.
[279:37.50]I'm going a little too fast here, hold on.
[279:43.35]No, I got them both.
[279:43.93]Okay.
[279:45.43]So that guy's got melee.
[279:57.80]I'm gonna go up to there.
[279:59.74]Not yet, because he's gonna snipe me from down there.
[280:01.66]When he turns his back, does he go this way?
[280:05.24]I wonder if he goes over here.
[280:06.10]I might just shoot him.
[280:08.91]There we go.
[280:11.37]Okay.
[280:24.24]One guy with a gun.
[280:28.31]Did I get him?
[280:28.81]No.
[280:31.45]Alright, last few guys are down here.
[280:36.13]Would I have five bullets?
[280:37.17]I kinda need to save him though.
[280:43.51]Only one guy with a gun, so this shouldn't be a problem.
[280:47.15]Unless I'm missing something.
[280:48.11]There's a dog, right?
[280:53.88]I would have fucking screamed.
[280:57.92]I would have screamed.
[281:01.32]You would have heard me.
[281:05.50]Like on the Las Vegas Strip if I had just screamed right there.
[281:15.59]Okay, is there one guy left?
[281:16.85]Let's check.
[281:18.80]two both in separate rooms it's just gonna take a little bit of just walking over there from this side it's not hard it's just easy just go in there and just just bop them just do one bop that's all you need to do it's really not a big deal just uh I'm like I'm having problems because I'm scared to go over here just bop them oh my god
[281:51.29]Dan here.
[281:51.65]I'm done cleaning up the suites upstairs.
[281:54.06]How many new guests arrived?
[281:57.02]This is Mike.
[281:57.56]I'm outside greeting the VIPs.
[282:00.82]Alright, I'll come down and collect their luggage.
[282:02.84]Fuck.
[282:04.24]Oh, man.
[282:07.85]That one wasn't that bad.
[282:08.99]I just don't like the ground.
[282:11.37]It just kind of hurts my eyes.
[282:14.91]I thought that the one that I got stuck on for 40 minutes I thought was way worse than this.
[282:20.56]I just don't like the way this one looks.
[282:28.38]Understood.
[282:52.73]It's the next soldier mission.
[282:56.30]There's some much, much worse ones later.
[283:04.46]Zero points for boldness.
[283:08.98]New weapon.
[283:09.84]Sniper rifle.
[283:14.35]We're going home after this.
[283:16.27]That's what the Colonel said.
[283:17.56]I guess that's a good cause for celebration.
[283:20.22]Damn straight, we should see if the commies left us anything to drink.
[283:24.84]This heat is killing me.
[283:27.02]I wouldn't mind a drink myself.
[283:28.28]When do you think the Colonel will get here?
[283:30.96]I'm sure he's got a bottle or two stashed away somewhere.
[283:33.12]It'll be a while.
[283:36.64]The roads around here are pretty rough.
[283:38.74]We should probably settle for some water for now and catch some sleep.
[283:43.44]I feel a lot safer here when D company arrives.
[283:46.50]That's me!
[283:47.08]I'm gonna get a D on this mission!
[283:49.96]Didn't you hear?
[283:50.48]Those guys are pussies.
[283:52.51]We're better off without them.
[283:54.19]We took down this place on our own, didn't we?
[283:57.27]What do we need them for, huh?
[284:01.03]I guess you're right, Barnes, but there's always safety in numbers.
[284:06.49]I'm gonna lie down for a while.
[284:07.79]I didn't get much sleep last night.
[284:10.85]Why are they using this song for intense dialogue?
[284:14.32]Um, guys, come on.
[284:15.60]I'm expelling, like, all of my mental energy trying to play the game.
[284:20.18]I can't, like, I can't, like, give you, I can't give you, like, voice acted cutscenes, too.
[284:27.10]I'm gonna go lie down for a while.
[284:28.34]Didn't get much sleep last night.
[284:29.54]Wake me up when the colonel gets here.
[284:37.38]Hard rock.
[284:41.84]Alright, here we're back again as this guy.
[284:44.72]This is Mary from Daycare Center on Northwest 159th.
[284:51.49]We're having a parent-teacher meeting tonight.
[284:54.55]Got it, I'll be there.
[284:56.71]Uh, click.
[284:58.11]Hello?
[284:58.79]Where'd you go?
[284:59.77]Hmm.
[285:09.14]Do a fat guy voice.
[285:10.56]No, I can't.
[285:12.65]It's all been sapped from me.
[285:18.81]What the hell?
[285:22.87]Hello there, we're just about to close up here.
[285:24.55]Is there anything I can help you with?
[285:26.31]I'm a member.
[285:27.65]That's how I'm glad to hear that.
[285:28.59]Thank you for your support.
[285:31.40]Nobody said fat guy?
[285:32.66]What?
[285:34.90]Sounds crazy, just think about it for a little while.
[285:37.24]I think I might be on something big here.
[285:39.76]Okay, you may as well just use your own voice.
[285:42.00]Like your headcanon here, because I'm just like, I don't know what's going on, what's the plan of yours?
[285:47.33]Just make sure I'm quick, I really need to be on my way.
[285:52.21]I'm getting strange phone calls.
[285:53.57]Strange phone calls, I wouldn't know anything about that.
[285:55.55]Look, just hear me out.
[285:57.47]These phone calls are telling me to do stuff.
[285:59.98]They sound like they're some kind of misplaced calls, but they're not.
[286:03.38]And if you don't do what they say, well, let's say you don't want to disobey them.
[286:07.69]They mean business if you know what I mean.
[286:10.31]What do you think this has to do with our organization 13?
[286:12.55]I don't know.
[286:15.52]I was thinking that's all you're getting and it was awful.
[286:17.30]I didn't have enough brain power for it.
[286:19.92]What if we set up a similar operation?
[286:23.12]Like, we go after the Russians, free America of our oppressors, you know?
[286:26.93]I mean, you have all these members and all the... I'm doing a terrible job.
[286:34.01]I'm doing the thing where your mother is reading you a story and she's falling asleep.
[286:41.68]And her words start to run together.
[286:44.36]Many of us have military experience and we'd wipe them out.
[286:47.46]We could start a civil movement and free ourselves.
[286:50.02]I'm not sure I follow.
[286:50.86]We're a peaceful organization.
[286:53.15]We never force anyone to do something they don't want to.
[286:55.28]I'm not sure what you're accusing us of.
[286:57.18]Man, you're not listening.
[286:58.16]I'm not accusing you of any... Oh, I get it.
[287:01.94]You're the ones.
[287:02.64]It all makes sense now.
[287:04.32]I can't believe I didn't figure it out sooner.
[287:06.94]My god, and here I was thinking I had this great... Oh, man.
[287:10.22]Look here, sir.
[287:10.80]We're closed, okay?
[287:11.66]If you don't mind, I'd really like for you to leave now.
[287:15.78]Can't talk about it here.
[287:16.74]Hey, gotcha.
[287:17.42]Don't worry, I'll keep your secret safe.
[287:19.13]You can count on me.
[287:20.01]Why is this Garfield?
[287:21.91]Why is this Garfield the Monday Killer doing bits?
[287:25.43]We're both patriots, right?
[287:26.55]I'll just go now.
[287:27.29]I have something important to do.
[287:29.01]If you know what I'm saying, huh?
[287:38.64]Okay.
[287:39.66]Well...
[287:45.36]Withdrawal.
[287:51.96]I really miss the masks.
[287:57.48]How do the masks even work in this game?
[287:59.36]I feel like this is only the second or third time I've been able to even pick one.
[288:03.97]Lethal throws or nail gun.
[288:05.27]I guess I'm going to use the nail gun.
[288:15.95]Did they just remove that whole mechanic from the game?
[288:20.42]What happened?
[288:20.94]Did I get shot?
[288:21.62]Start it over.
[288:35.37]Nail gun.
[288:40.93]Alright, we got down, up, left, right, one guy.
[288:47.24]Nailed.
[288:47.82]Alright, two guns.
[289:03.07]This nail gun's actually pretty cool.
[289:05.33]Dog.
[289:05.69]Yeah, I got two guns, but a dog.
[289:08.73]And I gotta get the dog with the last one.
[289:14.02]Got it, okay.
[289:16.88]Ooh, that's gonna be tricky.
[289:17.74]Give me a gun.
[289:21.52]What the fuck was that?
[289:24.08]Alright, two guys.
[289:24.82]I gotta be careful.
[289:25.82]Hide behind here.
[289:27.34]And let's try to make this quick.
[289:34.36]Oops.
[289:40.72]Oh my god, I almost didn't win.
[289:43.20]Oh boy, I might be getting a little rusty.
[289:57.57]Okay, I didn't even see that guy.
[289:59.43]Wow.
[290:03.03]Well, that alerts everybody.
[290:28.13]1, 2, 3, keep going.
[290:30.04]14 bullets?
[290:30.36]Alright, got a big guy.
[290:55.46]I did- holy shit, what the fuck is happening here?
[290:57.45]Give me- That's good.
[291:19.27]Jex is back and he's fatter than ever.
[291:30.35]Fuck, I got greedy.
[291:32.35]What's going on?
[291:34.63]What?
[291:40.44]Wait, what happened?
[291:43.58]What?
[291:51.40]We told you?
[291:53.74]I'm playing the game.
[291:58.41]Wha- How dare you focus on the video game?
[292:01.69]You should be looking over here!
[292:03.81]What?
[292:04.05]He's not gonna talk, is he?
[292:23.82]Well, I don't want, like, spoilers, like... Hey, by the way, don't die on the third floor, because it ruins the rest of the game, and it is a cutscene you're going to miss.
[292:31.24]I don't want to know that.
[292:32.10]I mean, I just lost.
[292:33.04]Whatever.
[292:33.36]Hey, I'm not going to talk.
[292:48.45]Got any last words, asshole?
[293:00.89]Isn't that the equivalent of, like, just telling me spoilers for the game?
[293:03.63]Because if I do know that, then I'm gonna... I would, like, play differently.
[293:15.54]I probably would still have lost, so it's not like a... I probably still would have lost.
[293:27.80]Don't die.
[293:28.56]Game ruined.
[293:33.00]Well, it wasn't don't die.
[293:34.14]It was apparently specifically don't die on the third floor.
[293:37.64]Don't die on the third floor.
[293:38.82]Do not die on the third floor.
[293:40.18]It's like, why?
[293:40.92]Why not?
[293:42.40]Oh, okay.
[293:42.74]Something will happen if I don't.
[293:44.40]Okay.
[293:48.65]Did you find anything?
[293:49.61]Well, no.
[293:49.97]Nothing substantial.
[293:57.67]We're good now, right?
[293:58.43]No more favors.
[294:10.19]Me too.
[294:10.89]Okay.
[294:17.54]October 30th.
[294:19.38]So tomorrow's our last mission, huh?
[294:24.86]Yeah, if they can't find another bullshit reason to get us killed.
[294:28.90]Uh-oh.
[294:30.62]But once I agree with you, Barnes, why are you always picking on me?
[294:33.33]We're in this shit together.
[294:35.09]That's for tomorrow.
[294:35.65]I don't get it.
[294:36.13]I really don't.
[294:37.15]How the hell are the four of us going to capture a power plant?
[294:43.21]They should be sending in a whole platoon.
[294:46.17]The place is likely booby-trapped.
[294:47.67]Too risky for a whole platoon.
[294:50.31]I guess we're more expendable.
[294:56.21]Do you see this?
[294:57.83]Can you see my face?
[294:59.77]This is my true nature.
[295:01.85]You see, don't you?
[295:02.55]This is who I am.
[295:03.31]This is who we all are.
[295:05.58]I really am reading these like fucking Garfield bits.
[295:35.45]Sir, are you okay?
[295:39.97]I have had a bit too much to drink.
[295:42.96]I'm feeling a little bit tired.
[295:44.18]Maybe I better go to bed.
[295:46.48]That might be a good idea, sir.
[295:48.16]I wonder what kind of fucked up shit he's been drinking.
[295:55.45]Okay.
[295:56.29]New weapons.
[295:57.49]So I choose a weapon.
[296:00.31]Or not.
[296:01.29]Not yet.
[296:06.67]Lieutenant.
[296:07.27]Yes, sir.
[296:08.15]I don't feel very good today.
[296:10.59]A bit much to drink yesterday.
[296:12.43]That's got nothing to do with it, unfortunately.
[296:15.14]I've got word that they're sending you boys home tomorrow.
[296:18.36]Lord knows whether they'll be lying or not, but that's not the issue.
[296:21.32]I'm afraid this might be your last mission, son.
[296:24.48]And that they'll be sending you home in body bags.
[296:27.91]You've seen the plans.
[296:29.47]You should know.
[296:30.45]You'll be walking right into a trap and there's little I can do about it.
[296:33.50]I've already said this to the others and I'll say it to you too.
[296:36.14]It's been damn good commanding this squad, Lieutenant.
[296:39.42]We may not win this war, but I couldn't be more proud of you boys.
[296:42.94]Thank you, sir.
[296:44.29]Good luck out there.
[296:45.25]You'll need it.
[296:46.89]See, I'm acting.
[296:48.09]I did some acting.
[296:48.91]Alright, so we just got a sniper.
[296:52.47]Uh...
[296:55.04]I think I have to... I'm going to stay with this.
[296:56.98]I'm staying with the fucking heavy machine gun.
[297:05.48]What?
[297:07.93]Sniper.
[297:09.13]Take out the sniper.
[297:09.99]What?
[297:10.27]What?
[297:10.55]What?
[297:10.87]What?
[297:11.09]What's going on here?
[297:15.75]What?
[297:15.87]Should I not die on the third floor?
[297:32.48]It's in emote only mode now.
[297:35.24]I was gonna go with this.
[297:36.75]Because it's powerful.
[297:37.81]But... Somebody said this gives me the giraffe powerup.
[297:44.35]Fine.
[297:46.51]You better not be lying to me.
[297:49.21]Level 15.
[297:49.99]Casuals.
[297:56.94]Some giraffe this is.
[297:59.40]Unbelievable.
[298:00.08]Thanks for the giraffe lie.
[298:02.42]Thanks for the giraffe lie.
[298:20.25]Those guys are real?
[298:21.16]I thought they were part of the environment.
[298:31.41]Holy fuck!
[298:32.15]Okay.
[298:53.67]I needed to reload the gun!
[298:55.07]Okay, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we're fine, we're fine!
[298:58.71]Why did it hit the...
[299:05.81]This thing sucks.
[299:07.52]Oh, yeah, I give you the giraffe powers, Jeremy.
[299:09.98]You're getting a lot of giraffe powers.
[299:11.92]See how far it goes?
[299:13.59]She made it, she made it, she made it, she made it, she made it, she made it, she made it.
[299:39.37]I need to get a drink.
[299:40.09]I need to get a drink of water or something.
[299:43.54]Alright, everybody relax.
[300:08.97]They don't have Heatstroke, what the fuck are you talking about?
[300:18.78]Alright, that's blocking them right there.
[300:20.30]I'm gonna wait.
[300:37.61]Oh my god, why are you still doing it then, Jeremy?
[300:42.19]I have to- Mmmmm.
[301:02.33]It is is garage guy. What?
[301:05.33]Did I just get reverse baited?
[301:24.33]Is that solid?
[301:25.31]I think it is.
[301:27.51]Right, I think that's the only two guys left here.
[301:45.20]So I gotta be very careful, very careful.
[301:47.46]Is he dead?
[302:16.50]Wait for these guys to come down and then go
[302:27.32]Where the fuck did you come from?
[302:29.54]Where am I going?
[302:51.20]I can get that guy.
[302:51.94]Just gotta go faster.
[302:59.13]Just like that.
[302:59.79]That's how you get it done.
[303:00.73]That's how you get it done!
[303:04.21]Oh, oh, oh!
[303:05.83]What did I freeze for?
[303:07.35]I fucking didn't even see him!
[303:16.18]I missed.
[303:17.98]And here we go.
[303:18.60]Time to die.
[303:26.89]Dead, dead, dead.
[303:28.11]Oh my God, will you die?
[303:29.27]I actually might be better off just wasting this shit.
[303:41.90]Here we go, I got him.
[303:43.14]Get ammo.
[303:43.46]Alright, now get this guy.
[303:45.88]You stupid motherfucker, how is it fucking possible?
[303:48.32]I had you lined up perfectly.
[303:50.06]It was perfect.
[303:51.18]Everything about it was perfect.
[304:06.45]Nah, I'm dead again.
[304:11.98]Why were you not together?
[304:12.78]That's the first- lookit.
[304:13.90]Only time you've ever not been right together.
[304:15.42]I didn't get it.
[304:17.44]It's alright.
[304:26.23]Jesus Christ.
[304:31.37]Yo, you know what my favorite part about Miami is?
[304:34.36]Uh, the Hotline portion of it.
[304:36.38]You know, I love Miami.
[304:37.64]I love, like, the Miami scene.
[304:39.50]I love playing Hotline Miami.
[304:41.44]I love Miami.
[304:43.06]Miami's wonderful this time of year, I hear.
[304:51.64]I gotta go this way.
[305:00.66]Fuck off.
[305:06.46]You gotta go this way.
[305:07.20]You have to.
[305:07.62]Ooh, you can get them both?
[305:18.27]Okay.
[305:24.73]I only have one bullet.
[305:41.80]What the hell is... What the hell is this?
[306:01.15]Wait for the other guy.
[306:01.95]Did it hit him?
[306:03.51]I don't think it hit him.
[306:04.47]No, it didn't hit him.
[306:07.55]I don't need this shitty sniper.
[306:21.14]Oh yeah, it's the locking on and locking off, locking on, locking off.
[306:34.74]If only you could see further, but I can't.
[306:36.92]I can't go back.
[306:38.22]Oh, man.
[306:40.62]Fuckin' Miami!
[306:41.69]Sure is nice this time of year!
[306:50.08]Get in!
[306:58.40]I know.
[306:58.90]I know.
[306:59.70]I know what... This is not Miami.
[307:01.22]That's the point.
[307:02.39]I want to be in Miami.
[307:03.57]I don't want to be in, like, Warzone.
[307:22.70]Where... I...
[307:26.87]Does that- No, it's gonna reset the whole thing, isn't it?
[307:32.64]Maybe I need to have the sniper rifle.
[307:34.18]I don't know.
[307:34.62]I'm just so fucking over this part of the game.
[307:50.04]I'm so fucked.
[307:50.68]I have no bullets.
[307:52.36]I have to, like, go over here now.
[307:55.10]I'll be fine.
[307:55.62]I'm gonna be fine.
[307:58.82]No, that's a regular guy.
[308:06.38]He was yelling at chat.
[308:07.32]No, because I picked up the sniper rifle and everybody told me it was awful.
[308:12.20]It was like, don't pick that up.
[308:13.54]Don't pick up the sniper rifle.
[308:14.80]Put it back.
[308:15.30]It sucks.
[308:15.88]And I'm just like, alright.
[308:23.13]I need two bullets for these big guys.
[308:31.04]Is one.
[308:32.58]Alright.
[308:33.99]Don't.
[308:34.47]Not yet.
[308:35.07]Hold on.
[308:35.81]Don't do it yet.
[308:40.27]This guy's gotta get the fuck outta here.
[308:46.81]I'm gonna wait.
[308:47.51]I'll wait the whole damn time.
[308:57.55]I've lost my damn mind.
[309:03.95]Oh, I have.
[309:04.99]I've lost my mind.
[309:07.03]Okay, here we go.
[309:09.23]Shoot him once and then hide.
[309:19.07]Okay.
[309:20.37]Now what do we got?
[309:20.97]There's a guy right here, but what's up there?
[309:23.67]Too bad I don't have the sniper rifle.
[309:29.81]To be able to see what's down the way.
[309:37.49]Maybe you should have picked up the sniper rifle!
[309:46.27]Got ya!
[309:48.57]What?
[309:48.81]What is that?
[309:49.36]What did I just hit?
[309:50.06]I hit the wall?
[309:50.58]I have one bullet.
[309:54.00]Okay, I gotta be careful.
[309:54.90]For real.
[309:55.50]I don't even know where any enemies are.
[309:59.81]I don't know what's down here.
[310:01.11]Is there anything over there?
[310:02.81]Is somebody through that door?
[310:04.43]I don't know.
[310:05.49]I think there's one guy.
[310:07.95]I don't have any more bullets.
[310:11.81]Oh, yes, I do.
[310:13.29]Yes, I do.
[310:13.89]Yes, I do.
[310:14.37]Yes, I do.
[310:16.24]We're having a good time here, folks.
[310:32.75]But, but, um, but, uh, I don't know what else is over here.
[310:38.69]Am I?
[310:39.97]Okay.
[310:40.87]Alright.
[310:41.35]I got him.
[310:43.16]Now, now there's one guy here.
[310:45.78]That corner is safe.
[310:47.46]But is it though?
[310:48.12]Because there's a guy right here.
[310:50.58]What the fuck are you?
[310:54.50]I need to take a second.
[310:55.10]I need to break.
[310:55.60]Hold on.
[310:55.90]I need, I need a second for, hold on.
[311:03.93]I will accidentally run over there and get hit.
[311:09.76]Okay, um... If you can pl- Okay, listen.
[311:12.84]This is important.
[311:15.44]There are people with superpowers living among us.
[311:18.22]There are.
[311:20.06]You ever see that movie?
[311:23.70]With Bruce Willis?
[311:26.33]Let me tell you something.
[311:27.87]If you can do this on hard and just fucking walk through it like there's no problem, you are seeing the world at like 0.85, you know, 0.85 speed.
[311:38.83]You just are and you're superhuman.
[311:42.34]I am very convinced that some of these like esports players, some people that are very good at video games and just like have lightning, you're seeing the world at like 0.9 where everyone else is seeing it 1.0.
[311:52.54]You just are.
[311:53.02]You have to be.
[311:53.52]You have a superpower.
[311:55.42]Because how the fuck is this?
[311:56.50]This is ridiculous.
[312:02.17]Okay, I got nine bullets.
[312:07.80]Got it.
[312:08.12]Thank God.
[312:10.79]You're seeing the world in 1.2 times.
[312:13.26]I might be, I don't know, but sooner or later someone's going to figure it out.
[312:16.62]Some scientist is going to come out with a study.
[312:19.26]Yes, it's really, it's quite interesting, you see.
[312:22.60]A tenth of the human population is actually perceiving the world at 0.97 speed.
[312:30.27]It's remarkable.
[312:31.31]That's why there's, you know, baseball players have this superpower, football players, soccer players, video game, esports players.
[312:39.19]I'm telling you, it's going to happen.
[312:55.63]Don't shoot.
[312:56.35]Redo it.
[312:56.95]No, just kill me.
[313:00.59]I can just bait people out of here.
[313:03.52]What the fuck were you?
[313:05.13]Look at that fucking superhuman eyes that guy has.
[313:07.63]That's bullshit.
[313:08.69]I get to see the world at like 1.14.
[313:11.49]Why do you get to see it at like 0.92?
[313:13.11]It's not fair.
[313:14.47]That's why it's not fair.
[313:17.41]Slow that person's game down.
[313:19.59]Now speed that person's game up.
[313:26.40]I can't leave.
[313:27.30]That's the problem.
[313:27.96]I can't leave once I get in there.
[313:29.56]What?
[313:30.68]Why am I not allowed to leave?
[313:32.94]I CAN'T LEAVE!
[313:33.50]Oh my, fuck you.
[313:49.68]It's so you can't cheese it.
[313:51.49]Well, that's wonderful.
[313:54.37]I need to at least be able to get rid of, like, one of these people.
[313:57.80]I can't shoot through this.
[314:01.22]Nice horn.
[314:02.41]Oh, I'm losing my mind.
[314:03.39]Alright.
[314:21.24]Who has a gun?
[314:21.92]Who has a gun?
[314:22.32]Who has a gun?
[314:22.76]This guy has a gun.
[314:24.24]He's dead.
[314:25.02]He's dead.
[314:25.96]Who else has a gun?
[314:27.65]Oooooooooh, okay.
[314:31.41]You idiot.
[314:32.45]YOU IDIOT!
[314:37.40]That's ammo right there.
[314:38.94]Shoot this guy through the fucking window.
[314:40.91]And then get the ammo.
[314:41.79]What about the guy with the gun right there?
[314:44.23]I have cover.
[314:45.37]There's just a guy with a machete.
[314:47.32]There's nobody with a gun here.
[314:48.76]Go up and just touch it and get the ammo.
[314:51.92]Oh, fuck.
[314:52.36]That guy saw, but it's okay.
[314:54.30]Relax.
[314:56.13]Why did you do that?
[314:57.17]Why did you do something like that?
[314:58.21]Why would you do that?
[314:58.75]Okay, everything's fine.
[315:07.93]I'm not gonna say it.
[315:08.77]I'm not gonna say it.
[315:09.83]I'm not gonna say Peter.
[315:11.41]I'm not going to.
[315:13.06]You thought you were gonna get it out of me this stream.
[315:14.60]Nope.
[315:15.50]I may have lost my fucking mind, but I'm not gonna say it.
[315:24.04]One of these guys has to be baited out here.
[315:26.04]Get over here.
[315:29.83]You already did.
[315:30.47]I know I did not.
[315:31.65]I'm certain of that.
[315:32.37]I am 100% certain.
[315:34.33]I did not say Peter.
[315:36.93]I didn't.
[315:38.49]I am a thousand percent certain.
[315:40.80]God fucking damn it.
[315:43.44]Who cares if I said Peter?
[315:46.08]I don't give a fuck.
[315:47.38]Why does it matter?
[315:48.32]That shouldn't matter.
[315:49.74]That shouldn't matter.
[315:50.91]Of all things to matter right now, and I was going well.
[315:54.71]He said Peter.
[316:14.96]Hey, Peter.
[316:16.90]Hey, what are you shaking?
[316:29.56]He's going psycho.
[316:30.54]I'm losing my mind, man.
[316:31.62]I really am.
[316:34.54]Oh, he shot me through the window.
[316:36.45]I'm gonna fucking win.
[316:38.07]I'm gonna beat the fucking level that you guys said, Peter.
[316:40.25]You know what I'm saying?
[316:41.15]I'm gonna do it.
[316:49.20]Big guy.
[316:50.40]Big guy, can you see?
[316:51.10]I need to get him, okay.
[316:56.00]Watch out for the guy in the window.
[316:58.36]Guy in the window.
[316:59.16]I don't think I can do anything about this.
[317:02.89]It's over.
[317:03.23]It's over.
[317:03.63]Let's go.
[317:04.05]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[317:07.67]No.
[317:08.95]I have to shoot the big guy through the window.
[317:13.85]You fucking stupid game.
[317:16.13]Why is it even possible?
[317:25.68]This is the guy I need to shoot right now.
[317:27.66]Go.
[317:28.08]Done.
[317:33.65]Okay, listen to me, Peter.
[317:34.57]Is there anybody else with a gun?
[317:44.00]Stop moving for a second.
[317:44.94]I need ammo.
[317:45.44]I have two bullets.
[317:46.54]Okay.
[317:47.62]Okay.
[317:48.52]I'm safe right here for now.
[317:54.12]What happened?
[317:55.20]What happened?
[317:56.04]No.
[317:56.10]What the fuck happened?
[317:57.24]Why?
[318:13.22]I tried to shoot the guy and it summons the whole fucking room.
[318:18.33]I'm going this way, fuck it.
[318:21.65]I can get in there.
[318:25.85]This is horrendous.
[318:27.49]This is horrendous.
[318:39.50]Because now here comes everybody.
[318:50.23]Alright, like, did... I seriously... Please, I'm not gonna rage quit.
[318:58.25]I'm going to beat this level.
[318:59.97]As stupid as this level is.
[319:02.39]And it's just like, hey, I have an idea.
[319:04.47]Let's just, like, make it impossible.
[319:07.48]Hey, you got a fun game?
[319:08.58]Yeah, it's called Hotline in Wartime.
[319:11.96]Shoot through windows and walls.
[319:14.42]Uh, Miami 2.
[319:21.54]What do you think, Vader?
[319:47.93]I can't.
[319:56.71]Oh my fucking lord.
[320:03.04]The fact that I can't go backwards is just like, give me a break.
[320:08.24]I have to shoot this guy, otherwise the fucking whole thing is over and he's still in his...
[320:19.54]Can you bait to the room?
[320:20.46]No, you're not allowed to leave once you come in here.
[320:23.04]For some reason, it's the only level in the entire two-game series where you can't walk out of the door.
[320:31.21]In the whole two-game series!
[320:36.07]Why?!
[320:36.47]Why?! !
[321:07.15]Die, die, die, die, die.
[321:08.75]Okay.
[321:10.65]One guy with a gun.
[321:11.37]I can't shoot him though.
[321:13.80]Every time I shoot at that guy, the whole fucking entire level attacks me.
[321:36.62]No guy with a gun, right?
[321:37.50]No guy with any guns, right?
[321:39.55]I don't know.
[321:40.21]Do they cross paths here?
[321:42.75]I gotta get ammo and I gotta go in this room.
[321:45.75]But I can't be seen, so just do it now.
[321:49.79]Why did that happen?
[321:51.35]Why did I click?
[321:54.79]I didn't pick up the fucking ammo until I clicked.
[322:02.95]I want to test something here, for real.
[322:04.27]Like, hold on.
[322:07.88]Okay, so you have to click.
[322:09.80]So if I clicked, it just shoots the fucking gun.
[322:16.81]That makes no sense.
[322:21.97]It's right click.
[322:24.77]I'm just gonna inhale the fucking universe.
[322:36.60]So, let me ask a question to chat, a real question.
[322:40.27]When you got to this level, were you like, this is the stupidest game I've ever played in my whole life?
[322:44.71]Did you get there?
[322:45.89]Did it happen?
[322:53.96]At what point in this mission did you go, hey, this is probably the dumbest thing I've ever done as an adult?
[323:00.80]When did you do it?
[323:10.98]Alright, I'm slowing down.
[323:12.24]Alright.
[323:27.82]Oh my fucking lord.
[323:32.90]Shoot from outside the building.
[323:35.96]But... That...
[323:39.67]I have to get, like, the perfect angle here.
[323:43.23]No, I can't!
[323:44.63]Wait, why could I just do it there?
[323:47.17]Why was it allowed there and not where it was?
[323:50.24]Oh, my fucking lord.
[323:56.56]Oh, I'm fucked again.
[324:12.38]I think we need to meditate.
[324:13.46]No, I... I don't know, why is this in the game?
[324:17.60]Why is this in the game?
[324:18.72]Okay, let me cheeseball the whole level.
[324:35.42]Is this what you're supposed to do?
[324:36.64]Is this what you guys are talking about?
[324:37.86]Is this what I'm supposed to do?
[324:54.42]I'm not done, though.
[324:55.28]A guy's gonna come right through here and start running at me.
[324:59.34]That's what happened last time.
[325:00.34]Alright, right click.
[325:05.51]Here comes the other guy with a gun.
[325:06.89]Don't shoot him!
[325:09.23]I need to... Where the hell do I need to go from here?
[325:16.31]I'm not... Okay, two guns.
[325:17.91]One... I got machine gun, machine gun.
[325:19.55]I have to stab this guy.
[325:24.17]I think, I don't know, maybe I can't, because if I shoot it's gonna, everyone's gonna sprint in the room.
[325:30.75]There's a guy over here, two machetes.
[325:33.83]So let me bait out this guy right now.
[325:36.95]He didn't even see me.
[325:39.39]Somehow, some, somehow he just, god damn it man.
[325:47.20]Oh my fucking lord.
[325:53.72]And now I'm back out here again.
[325:54.96]I can't cheese the level anymore.
[325:56.20]Kill me.
[325:59.62]Going to the right room?
[326:00.47]Well, I... That's where I was planning on trying to bait.
[326:08.19]And now I have to do this thing.
[326:09.49]The, like, cheat to beat the level thing.
[326:29.01]Just rush the level.
[326:30.97]How on Earth am I supposed- Go fast!
[326:32.97]What are you talking about?
[326:34.05]How am I supposed to do that if I don't know where the hell the fuck I'm supposed to go?
[326:40.67]Just go fast!
[326:42.31]And die!
[326:42.91]Okay.
[326:59.01]Let's see if I can pull this dude.
[327:01.53]No, fuck it.
[327:02.23]Just get in here.
[327:09.51]Right side is clear.
[327:13.47]New ground reached.
[327:20.42]Rushing in is the way it's played?
[327:21.50]Oh, I agree for 90% of the game, but I can't do that here.
[327:25.68]Everybody has an assault rifle.
[327:31.96]That's the top of the level.
[327:36.08]Oh, God.
[327:36.84]Okay.
[327:38.08]There's no windows, right?
[327:41.82]So let's try this.
[327:42.72]I don't have any ammo.
[327:47.95]There's so many people in this room.
[327:52.93]I need to get the ammo.
[327:56.43]Just don't shoot me, please.
[327:58.42]Nobody over there, right?
[327:59.44]Just get it.
[328:08.70]One, two, three, four guys with guns.
[328:13.34]Baiting is gonna be a fucking nightmare.
[328:26.89]Stay right here.
[328:35.30]Okay, only one more guy with a gun.
[328:41.03]I'm fucking losing my mind.
[328:41.95]I'm panicking.
[328:42.41]Okay.
[328:43.67]That's it, right?
[328:44.47]Last guy.
[328:49.22]Jesus Christ.
[328:55.27]Oh, there's more of this shit.
[329:16.42]Okay, what the hell else is here?
[329:17.92]I need ammo.
[329:22.34]Is there a big guy in this room?
[329:24.08]In this level?
[329:25.00]I can't tell.
[329:27.75]Spacebar to execute?
[329:28.57]I didn't have brain power for that.
[329:29.67]Fuck.
[329:40.96]Oh my fucking god.
[329:49.49]Alright, let me... How far away is this to the end of the game?
[329:55.26]Or is this just like the, hey, throw this fucking dumb shit in the middle of the game.
[330:17.20]What the fuck happened there?
[330:18.38]I tried to click, whatever.
[330:40.94]No, guy with a machine gun coming up here.
[330:43.62]I trow, it's not throw weapon.
[330:45.98]Oh man, I'm getting to the point where I... Oh boy, is this... It's right click to change, not right click to throw.
[330:54.85]Jesus, come on.
[331:24.57]Big guy.
[331:25.01]There's a big guy in that room.
[331:25.97]Let me go down.
[331:29.84]Did you see me?
[331:31.34]Apparently you did.
[331:34.32]No guns down here.
[331:35.10]Not that I can see.
[331:39.68]Right?
[331:40.01]I don't see any guns.
[331:48.45]What the fuck is that?
[331:50.03]Okay, I'm fine.
[332:03.40]He's got a gun.
[332:03.96]I can shoot him through the wall.
[332:10.90]Where's the big guy?
[332:13.22]I've not seen big guy yet.
[332:15.44]He's definitely over here.
[332:16.26]I think the big guy might be the last person in here.
[332:24.06]Now it's that room.
[332:24.70]Big guy and a guy with a sword.
[332:25.96]Okay.
[332:27.75]Back around.
[332:37.52]Looking for windows.
[332:38.58]Okay, guy with a machine gun.
[332:41.84]Big guy and a guy with a knife.
[332:43.06]I can kill the guy.
[332:43.98]I can knife this guy right now.
[332:45.82]And then it should be not that big of a deal.
[332:50.79]I just have to shoot him.
[332:52.63]And then run out the fucking door.
[332:55.51]Make sure this shit is open.
[333:04.25]There's no ammo in that gun, dude.
[333:08.63]I did it.
[333:08.99]I fucking did it.
[333:09.59]I did it.
[333:09.83]Get me out of here.
[333:10.25]I don't care what's in here.
[333:11.59]Exit.
[333:11.93]Now.
[333:12.01]Well, that's not it.
[333:22.56]That's not it.
[333:31.06]I need ammo.
[333:40.68]Alright, that was... What did I say it was?
[333:46.62]Kind of, like, difficult?
[333:47.62]Like, really, like, sort of difficult?
[333:49.73]Oh, no, I said that's the worst thing I've ever done as an adult.
[333:51.73]Oh, that's right, I forgot.
[333:57.09]I've done so many more worse things.
[333:59.52]Think about that.
[334:00.16]The worst thing I've ever done in my life as an adult?
[334:09.12]Okay, it looks like their boss totally lost it.
[334:13.10]What?
[334:14.38]No point going in there now, is there?
[334:15.58]Guys, I think we better get out of here.
[334:22.06]What did you do as a kid?
[334:23.40]What the fuck?
[334:31.39]How do I get out of here?
[334:39.06]Yeah, eat shit level.
[335:08.45]My name is Ben Smith.
[335:09.57]My car's broken down on me.
[335:11.91]I need... Can you repeat that?
[335:15.85]My name is... Fuck it.
[335:17.49]Look, we need a case back here.
[335:23.76]1942.
[335:23.78]51, 55, 28.
[335:23.88]Then step on it.
[335:25.48]He's bleeding out.
[335:31.17]Hang in there, buddy.
[335:31.65]They'll be here real soon.
[335:36.78]No need to thank me, kid.
[335:37.86]It's on the house.
[335:39.62]You would have done the same for me, right?
[335:42.32]I think I hear the chopper coming.
[335:44.18]Maybe you should take this so you don't forget who saved your ass.
[335:59.80]Is that...
[336:01.40]Alright, is there... I got a C- on that level and it was 32 minutes.
[336:05.45]Wait, that felt like four hours.
[336:08.11]How is that less than the other level that I freaked out at?
[336:16.13]I feel like I was there for four hours.
[336:19.14]I don't remember what we've been talking about.
[336:20.68]Okay, I got a flamethrower.
[336:28.40]Sorry to hear about that.
[336:29.24]Things like that are never easy.
[336:32.30]Well, yeah.
[336:33.46]You know what they say, time heals all wounds.
[336:35.78]Right?
[336:36.34]Say, you remember that photo we talked about from Hawaii?
[336:39.19]Did you ever get around to sending me a copy of it?
[336:42.19]Right?
[336:42.33]Well, whenever you get a chance, man.
[336:43.85]Look, there seems to be something going on outside my shop.
[336:46.73]I'm gonna go have a look, okay?
[336:47.93]Alright, talk to you later.
[336:48.67]Bye.
[336:48.83]Alright, this happened in the first game.
[336:58.25]Is the guy beaten up over there, or... Nope.
[337:00.77]Time is being melted away.
[337:02.03]The tape fucked up.
[337:03.01]Time to put in a new tape.
[337:16.70]Act 5.
[337:17.24]Intermission.
[337:17.68]So this is... We're at the halfway point.
[337:24.46]Made it to... 50% of the way done!
[337:31.48]Get the phone.
[337:40.53]Hello, Evan speaking.
[337:42.47]Hi, this is, you spoke to my mother.
[337:44.67]I didn't even do Coca-Cola Classic.
[337:46.05]I'm sorry, guys.
[337:51.93]I'll be right back.
[338:02.89]Thank you.
[339:15.99]You guys didn't know I've been here the whole time.
[339:46.15]Let's move around here.
[339:47.05]Is there a bug on my monitor?
[339:52.86]Yeah, I've been sitting here this whole time.
[339:55.16]I thought there was like a bug on the monitor.
[339:59.03]But yeah, I'm going to turn the camera off now.
[340:01.21]So just in case you guys are curious.
[340:02.35]I'm going off.
[340:19.18]I don't even, like, drink soda.
[340:20.72]I've been drinking so much, like, soda lately.
[340:27.09]Uh, thank you, Nico, for the $50 earlier.
[340:29.47]Thank you so much.
[340:31.03]That's a lot of fucking money, dude.
[340:32.23]Thank you.
[340:33.21]I said you did it.
[340:36.57]Yeah, I went... I was kicking and screaming, but I did do it.
[340:45.94]Alright, let's go.
[340:48.05]So how many more temper tantrum levels do you think there are?
[340:50.67]Hi, this is, you spoke to my mother.
[340:54.79]She told me to call you, said you wanted to talk.
[341:01.26]It's about the mask maniac, right?
[341:03.58]Right, I didn't think you'd call, to be honest.
[341:05.66]Well, if you've got time, I'd love to hear your story.
[341:08.00]I've got time, alright, but it'll cost you.
[341:10.42]See, I need a plane ticket.
[341:11.42]I know it's a lot to ask for, but I'm sure it'll be worth your while.
[341:17.24]Do we have a deal?
[341:18.94]Well, I can't promise you anything, but if your story's half as good as you say, then I'll see what I can do.
[341:24.32]Fair enough.
[341:26.02]So where do you want me to begin?
[341:27.64]Right from the beginning.
[341:29.14]I want to get the full picture.
[341:30.36]Alright.
[341:31.26]Well, it all started with these strange messages on my phone.
[341:34.54]At first, they were pretty straight, asking me to do things, small things like calling random numbers, leaving cryptic messages, going around town, painting these marks at certain points.
[341:45.36]Marks.
[341:47.48]Yeah, I circle with three lines across.
[341:49.86]Anyway, I didn't want... I don't... Anyway, I didn't do what they told me to.
[341:54.49]Figured it was all a prank.
[341:56.69]After a while, the messages started getting threatening.
[341:58.49]A few days passed, and one morning I woke up to find my car torched.
[342:02.49]And there was this message on my machine saying I better do what I was told, or bad things would happen.
[342:08.73]Okay.
[342:15.58]I'm on the phone.
[342:18.20]Let's listen.
[342:18.98]You've got one new message.
[342:20.20]Hi, this is Susan from Miami Funeral.
[342:22.72]We've got an appointment scheduled with you today for the funeral of Rosa Berg.
[342:26.95]Come whenever you like.
[342:30.75]We're open all day.
[342:31.43]Our office is on NE139.
[342:34.41]Click.
[342:36.70]Okay.
[342:38.26]Whoops-a-daisy.
[342:39.64]Oh, go back.
[342:42.52]What the hell are you doing?
[342:55.86]All of the rules of 17th scene.
[342:58.26]First blood.
[343:03.24]Wish my happy anniversary to your girlfriend?
[343:05.61]Okay, well I got fist... This is a big bar.
[343:11.55]Alright, knock the guy out.
[343:13.47]I... Watch this one.
[343:19.79]No, never mind.
[343:20.45]Watch this one instead.
[343:26.41]I can't go that way.
[343:31.94]Hmm.
[343:35.32]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[343:39.52]I gotta use the door.
[343:40.38]Alright, use the door.
[343:44.70]Fuck.
[343:46.34]Fuck.
[343:47.93]Fuck.
[343:51.59]Hey, nice, nice door.
[344:04.19]There's a guy with a gun over there!
[344:05.45]Where's the guy with the shotgun?
[344:24.31]I have one bullet.
[344:25.47]Fuck, what was I thinking?
[344:41.97]Just knock him out.
[344:42.71]Guy with the shotgun.
[344:54.85]Shit.
[344:56.69]Mmm.
[344:59.21]Mmm.
[345:00.90]Mmm.
[345:11.37]No, wrong item.
[345:13.11]There's fucking like a hundred melee weapons on the ground and somehow I keep picking up the shotgun.
[345:23.84]Like there were seven... Explain it to me.
[345:29.48]I'm standing on a pipe.
[345:32.36]Why did it pick up the shotgun?
[345:35.17]Why?
[345:35.97]I'm standing on top of it.
[345:46.06]It prioritizes it.
[345:47.96]On this level, that's bad.
[345:49.22]Oh my fucking god.
[346:00.88]Fuck that priority.
[346:01.96]Bullshit!
[346:17.40]No, that's not how- You have to use the melee.
[346:19.40]It's faster.
[346:20.06]Alright, slow it down.
[346:41.51]I don't give a shit about the combo right now.
[346:43.53]It's hard to kill seven people.
[346:45.61]Ten people in the same spot.
[346:48.71]Alright, give me the shotgun.
[347:05.19]Oh, fuck.
[347:07.65]Okay.
[347:08.07]Jeez!
[347:08.89]I didn't even pick up one with an- I didn't pick up one with ammo!
[347:18.83]Get that fucking gun out of here.
[347:36.30]Um, excuse me.
[347:38.12]Could you... What the fuck was that?
[347:47.54]Ah, he saw me.
[348:00.17]Is this guy gonna come over here, or what are you doing, man?
[348:14.99]Lot of people down there.
[348:16.03]Oy.
[348:17.53]Okay.
[348:35.53]That's it, right?
[348:36.25]There's two guys with melee?
[348:45.03]Alright.
[348:57.74]Look how much better you are after the hard mission, though.
[349:01.18]Yeah, but fuck that, man.
[349:03.40]I lost, like, a year of my life
[349:11.05]It's a C-.
[349:14.97]These levels are, like, fun.
[349:16.93]That's, like, that's cool.
[349:17.89]Trying to figure out how to fight, like, ten guys in the same room.
[349:20.27]That's cool.
[349:30.93]Five stress years.
[349:37.07]Mom, what are you doing down here?
[349:39.19]I was hungry, so I decided to have a snack.
[349:41.17]I can take care of myself, you know?
[349:42.97]You don't have to worry about me so much.
[349:46.33]You know, the doctor told you not to move around too much.
[349:49.50]I don't care what the doctor said.
[349:52.88]I'm not dead yet.
[349:54.20]I'm deleting that from my OBS source.
[349:56.52]I don't know why I keep doing that.
[349:58.38]I'm not dead yet.
[349:58.94]I still got some fight left in me.
[350:01.60]I'm gonna just delete it from my OBS window.
[350:04.09]Because there's no reason for that to be there anymore.
[350:11.30]It's the same, like lean in.
[350:12.68]Do you want to do a face cam for one of these?
[350:18.08]Like a real one?
[350:20.20]Fine.
[350:21.26]I'll do a real face cam.
[350:28.85]No, that's the wrong one.
[350:33.23]Okay.
[350:34.47]Hi guys.
[350:35.01]How are you?
[350:39.39]Why am I so- This camera's like in the wrong spot.
[350:46.22]That's better.
[350:52.76]Look at the- Look at how- Okay, look at how my hair- I wanna see- Wanna see something funny?
[350:56.97]Look at how my hair has changed.
[350:59.21]I look like fucking crazed.
[351:01.71]Ready for this?
[351:02.41]Look at this shit.
[351:17.03]Don't I look fucking crazed right now with my hair all fucked up?
[351:21.72]See, it's like slicked back.
[351:22.96]I look good.
[351:23.58]This is like months of stress.
[351:38.15]Which one's the real one?
[351:39.07]The one that looks like shit.
[351:41.89]This is like after six hours of me slowly, slowly dying.
[351:48.31]Alright, that's fine.
[351:55.14]Is that in a good place?
[352:00.82]Alright, time to head out.
[352:02.60]You get to see the fucking dumb faces I make and how fucked up I look.
[352:06.10]Something urgent.
[352:06.56]I was hoping you would give me a bath.
[352:07.94]I'm feeling a bit cold.
[352:12.72]Sorry, Mom.
[352:13.26]I'll help you with the bath.
[352:14.42]I don't like the fact that you can see me drink this.
[352:18.24]I see.
[352:18.72]Well, where are you going then?
[352:19.70]Is it another job interview?
[352:21.38]I'm sure you'll get it this time.
[352:26.54]I'm sure you'll get it.
[352:28.37]Don't get your hopes up, Mom.
[352:29.33]Finding work ain't easy.
[352:31.62]You're such a bright young man.
[352:32.75]You're such... You're missing out.
[352:33.93]You're sure missing out.
[352:34.63]Don't worry.
[352:34.99]You'll find something eventually.
[352:36.55]Yeah, well, I gotta go.
[352:37.25]I'll be back as soon as I can.
[352:38.33]Okay?
[352:39.57]Oh, you run along now, dear.
[352:40.46]You don't want to be late.
[352:46.12]Use a straw to save your teeth to damage them.
[352:48.13]I'm gonna floss after this.
[352:52.25]You got a new message.
[352:53.05]Hello, this is Andrew from Package Express.
[352:55.29]You have some goods to deliver.
[352:57.62]The shipment may be fragile, so make sure to handle the package carefully.
[353:00.82]Don't be late, and don't forget to wear your uniform.
[353:06.69]Click.
[353:08.63]Here we go.
[353:10.31]Alright, this is why, like, I don't have face cam turned on.
[353:13.19]You're about to find out why.
[353:23.69]I'm making a weird corridor.
[353:24.97]Can we go like this?
[353:27.33]So I don't look... I have the fucking lady from the Brady Bunch hair again.
[353:32.05]I don't know how this keeps happening.
[353:35.10]What's her name?
[353:37.16]The chef on the show?
[353:38.70]Alice?
[353:43.08]Yeah, demolition.
[353:44.12]Level 18.
[353:44.26]Scene 18.
[353:44.42]Okay.
[353:53.32]This one's a little darker than the last few.
[353:55.96]Okay, I gotta throw.
[353:59.38]Okay.
[354:00.06]Bait.
[354:00.70]Punch, punch.
[354:01.32]Grab.
[354:01.81]Throw.
[354:02.63]Grab.
[354:03.05]Throw.
[354:03.93]Smack.
[354:04.41]Throw.
[354:04.95]Punch.
[354:05.51]Swing.
[354:09.27]Why am I doing this?
[354:11.81]Oh, I can't do that.
[354:12.79]Can I go over here?
[354:15.85]Is it only the... Can I go in the back door?
[354:19.05]Why would I be able to even come over here?
[354:23.51]Okay.
[354:25.31]That's not a glitch.
[354:35.70]Fuck.
[354:36.54]I gotta throw that at the guy over there.
[354:40.88]Can you even kill the big guys with melee?
[354:42.92]I don't think you even can.
[354:49.07]No, you can't.
[354:51.02]So I have to throw melee at guy with gun, grab gun, shoot big guy.
[355:00.05]Well, he was in the wrong spot.
[355:03.11]Fuck.
[355:05.15]Alright, go now.
[355:16.84]Damn it!
[355:30.71]Fuck you!
[355:33.31]It prioritizes guns!
[355:34.63]It prioritizes guns!
[355:35.69]Look at me!
[355:36.83]Look at me!
[355:37.31]It prioritizes the guns!
[356:34.97]Where's the guy with the shotgun?
[356:36.05]Oh, I fucking missed and that was the one right there.
[356:45.49]I don't understand why.
[356:46.87]It's not picking the shotgun up.
[356:48.61]The weapon priority, it just doesn't matter.
[356:50.67]It's just random.
[356:51.46]It's a random number between 1 and fucking 12.
[357:04.10]Damn it, man.
[357:14.97]In a world where it's so hard to actually... I've run over the gun like three times and tried to pick it up and it just picks up another item.
[357:41.89]What in the name of fucking god does he keep doing that for?
[357:48.16]Why?
[357:58.25]Rush the guy with the gun?
[357:59.23]He has a gun!
[358:35.62]It's fucking locked onto him too, and I can't understand why it continues.
[359:04.58]I'm trying to press D and S at the same fucking time.
[359:07.92]What am I locked onto, of course?
[359:12.28]Where are you going?
[359:16.30]You gotta be close enough to throw it at him, but it's an open fucking area!
[359:19.86]It's just open!
[359:22.02]Everybody can just look at you!
[359:25.16]I gotta be close enough to throw this at him, and then... Just run to him.
[359:32.58]Okay!
[359:55.73]What kind of level is this, by the way?
[359:57.45]What is this, like, level design?
[359:59.03]It's just a giant fucking hall.
[360:00.72]There's no level here.
[360:02.40]Where are we?
[360:03.06]Are we on a roof?
[360:04.86]What is this?
[360:05.42]Why are these people here?
[360:14.37]Where are the couches?
[360:15.13]Where are the TVs?
[360:27.86]and it hit the fucking wall and bounced off and just stopped.
[360:55.17]Oh my god, I have to just go like this.
[361:00.13]Just move in fucking erratic patterns.
[361:02.13]No, it doesn't matter.
[361:05.11]Kill three melee and wait.
[361:06.59]But I have to be close enough to throw the thing at him.
[361:12.62]Once I get to a point where I'm close enough to throw it at him, I'm just dead.
[361:16.42]Every time.
[361:22.31]It didn't even matter that time.
[361:24.57]There are other doors?
[361:25.29]I can't use the other doors.
[361:27.23]Look.
[361:28.45]They cannot be used.
[361:43.60]I can't go over there and get it.
[361:44.40]There was only two bullets in that gun!
[361:53.96]Any other guns?
[362:00.28]Oh, why?
[362:00.82]This is so fucking painful.
[362:06.48]This is like gotcha bullshit.
[362:15.31]How did I fuck it up?
[362:16.01]Because I couldn't pick up the gun the first time.
[362:22.27]It's very easy.
[362:22.97]When you run over and press the pick up, the only thing that exists, it's pick up weapon on ground.
[362:44.58]Stop walking on and throwing it?
[362:46.16]Well, what?
[362:47.34]How else do I make sure I can, like, get it on him?
[362:50.74]And sometimes he just runs over here.
[363:32.41]No, fuck!
[363:36.03]He's got that, like, bodyguard with him to try to, like, ambush him around the corner.
[363:39.13]It's like you run into the fat guy, and the fat guy just punches you.
[363:46.10]Why did this game turn into, like, Hitman Go, by the way?
[363:48.74]Like, what happened-
[364:05.58]hug the wall?
[364:06.78]You're talking about, like, when he comes down here, hug this wall.
[364:09.68]But then the fat guy's gonna punch me in the face.
[364:12.14]Oh my god!
[364:22.10]Alright, so fat guy's still- so I have to go, like, right there!
[364:24.24]And then sprint and punch him.
[364:26.30]Where's the other guy?
[364:28.50]Wasn't there three people in this level?
[364:31.24]What's he doing all the way over there?
[364:39.48]no no no good you beat it you beat level four and hit man go
[365:14.44]Alright.
[365:37.94]Look at all these fucking people with guns, man.
[365:39.71]Holy shit.
[365:43.07]Get rid of the fucking dog.
[365:55.08]Jesus, they can't... God damn it.
[366:08.48]Give me the- give me this.
[366:15.21]So.
[366:15.89]So they heard a SILENCED gun.
[366:18.47]Did the- I don't even know what happened.
[366:30.20]Oh, there's not even a door there!
[366:31.76]What the fuck?
[366:38.70]I thought there was a door here.
[366:47.81]How the fuck am I gonna do this?
[366:50.45]I need that shotgun to shoot the big guy.
[366:57.46]Oh.
[367:14.26]Come on through the door.
[367:15.59]Hi.
[367:19.58]Give me that shotgun.
[367:45.98]This is the maddest you've ever seen me?
[367:59.69]It's because this game is fucking ridiculous.
[368:20.90]Mad because bad.
[368:23.74]Yeah, sure.
[368:25.64]Sure.
[368:26.18]I wonder what your first playthrough looked like.
[368:29.40]Let's see your video of you playing the first time.
[368:32.41]Huh?
[368:33.51]I thought you died a thousand fucking times.
[368:50.26]Alright, back up.
[368:53.82]Hey, I beat it already, what's your excuse?
[368:59.93]I'm- my monitor.
[369:00.79]Don't- that's not funny.
[369:13.87]The, like, monitor falling backwards is not, like, a thing I want to do tonight.
[369:30.14]Alright, where's that?
[369:31.12]Did the dog... Did the... Dog is dead.
[369:46.45]And the guys just rush the... Why do the other guys don't come in?
[369:50.09]I don't get it.
[369:50.95]Why do these guys all don't run in?
[369:53.19]Just the guy... These people heard that?
[369:57.07]Somehow?
[370:03.70]Turn the brightness up.
[370:10.81]Give me that gun.
[370:14.49]Same deal.
[370:17.56]Alright.
[370:36.40]Give me something better than this.
[370:37.52]The shotgun is alright.
[370:38.48]I don't... The shotgun... I'm not a fan of the shotgun.
[370:42.04]I mean... Look at how many guns are just pointed at this door.
[370:45.24]Hmm... I might be better off just going around here.
[370:51.85]But it's gonna... It's gonna pull everybody.
[370:59.35]I'm gonna have to... No, but these guys will shoot me too.
[371:08.82]I really don't... I don't know.
[371:10.04]I think it's just kind of pick them off from here.
[371:11.60]Alright, there's only a couple left.
[371:28.37]The question is, when I shoot this guy, I think I'm gonna go through here.
[371:35.00]Give me a break.
[371:35.96]I fucking can't believe I didn't kill them all.
[371:39.20]God damn it.
[371:45.25]That's just so many reflexes in a second time.
[371:51.60]Just takes like a quarter of a second and he's dead.
[372:09.65]You use fists when they rush you?
[372:12.09]When they are all shooting guns at you?
[372:15.25]You use fists?
[372:23.27]You only use fists when the seven or eight people with a shotgun.
[372:36.02]You punch much faster?
[372:43.17]They're rushing through the door.
[372:44.91]Instead of shooting, just punch.
[372:53.00]Oh, fuck.
[372:56.54]How much is actually left in the game before I literally strangle myself?
[373:03.43]How many more levels are there, do you think?
[373:04.89]How many are there?
[373:09.39]Six?
[373:11.77]There's six more chapters to this game?
[373:20.56]You're on the first level!
[373:31.12]Nah, I dropped it.
[373:31.76]I can't- I couldn't even see where it was on the ground.
[373:36.72]Rage quit?
[373:37.39]Well, is it a rage quit if the game is like ten hours long and six hours of this is like mind-melting?
[373:44.81]You don't have to beat the whole thing in one sitting.
[373:52.18]They heard that.
[373:56.22]No, I gotta get... Alright, I'm turning the camera.
[374:01.09]I gotta go cam-less.
[374:23.26]Yeah, I'm losing it.
[374:25.28]I actually think I might have to take a break.
[374:26.90]I need a gun.
[374:33.52]I still have a gun.
[374:38.18]Where did the fat guy go?
[374:39.04]Oh my lord.
[374:46.61]Take a break and play Katamari Damacy.
[374:48.87]No, if I take a break, I'm not playing this game again tonight.
[374:56.81]Fucking dog.
[375:28.54]Did he actually see me through the fucking door?
[375:30.18]Does he have a gun?
[375:33.16]Alright, that gotta be dead.
[375:33.94]I'm gonna try a few more times.
[375:43.39]This is the nightmare scenario.
[375:44.97]That's this room, and then you gotta... This is a silenced gun, though.
[375:47.93]Okay, there goes that guy.
[376:01.52]Once somebody shoots here, it's over.
[376:02.98]I mean, what's down here?
[376:10.76]No, I'll get caught up in there.
[376:12.60]I gotta go this way, I think.
[376:20.15]Oh, fuck.
[376:26.39]Alright, it's okay.
[376:27.59]There's only one guy with a gun here.
[376:30.20]But that door is open now.
[376:31.42]I only got three bullets before everyone's gonna hear me.
[376:40.93]I gotta make these count.
[376:46.70]Alright.
[376:47.68]One more shot.
[376:48.46]I wanna get the guy with the gun.
[376:51.72]Oh fuck.
[376:52.36]That guy came in the room.
[377:01.43]That guy's got a gun.
[377:02.36]I should be able to get rid of him.
[377:04.18]Nobody else in there, right?
[377:05.50]That's it, I think.
[377:12.62]He can see, right?
[377:13.36]He can.
[377:15.72]Jesus, no!
[377:16.80]Oh man, oh man, oh man!
[377:19.53]Fucking hell!
[377:38.52]Wow!
[377:42.81]Okay, you know how, uh, if you go to the PlayStation Trophies menu thing, and you go to, like, how many people got to, like, the Cleric Beast in Bloodborne?
[377:52.99]I wonder what that looks like for this game.
[377:56.57]Seriously.
[378:15.53]Cleric?
[378:15.83]Yeah, Cleric Beast is the first boss.
[378:25.46]I just, I need like a shotgun and I'm just gonna bring them in here and see if I can just clear it out.
[378:32.12]I feel like that's been a shitload of this game though.
[378:34.08]Am I crazier to think that... Oh, let me just like go like this and bring everybody in here.
[378:41.11]I... Is that like... You know what I mean?
[378:44.55]Shoot and then like just sit here.
[379:00.34]That seems to be the strat for this game.
[379:03.98]Okay.
[379:04.80]I... I guess.
[379:29.32]I mean, eventually I'm gonna do this.
[379:33.74]But, I don't know.
[379:34.83]Just gonna pull everybody over here.
[379:46.29]Alright.
[379:48.77]This big guy.
[379:53.58]Don't just shoot.
[379:54.34]Don't just shoot.
[379:55.40]I missed him.
[379:55.78]Alright, I got one fucking bullet.
[379:58.46]Make it count.
[379:59.32]And I hit the fucking door.
[380:06.10]God damn it, man.
[380:06.94]I hit the fucking door.
[380:08.02]Like, give me a break.
[380:37.79]That's the strategy most people use and complain about, but take it from someone who's done S rank on every level, that's not how you do it.
[380:44.24]Well, if most people do it like this, isn't that potentially a problem with the game itself?
[380:50.80]You know what I mean?
[380:52.34]If, like, most people do it like this, isn't that kind of like a... Shouldn't it not be like that?
[380:56.16]I don't remember doing this... I do not remember doing this type of shit in the first game.
[381:09.90]This game's a lot of fun.
[381:11.06]I'm having a good time.
[381:12.82]I think the game's like a very fun... It's fun to like... Run around rooms!
[381:15.94]Grab, grab, grab!
[381:16.34]What's next?
[381:28.52]But like, shooting a wall so people run into the room?
[381:30.93]I mean like, what the heck is that?
[381:55.78]Fuck, I didn't have the right- I gotta stop picking up the shotgun.
[382:08.97]Fuck.
[382:09.55]The bottom.
[382:33.55]God damn it.
[382:41.32]I want to at least get to the end of this level.
[382:43.49]I feel like I'll do it eventually.
[383:03.01]No, again I did it again.
[383:09.42]I wish I didn't drop the gun when I do that.
[383:11.14]How am I doing that?
[383:19.40]Try this again.
[383:22.33]Alright.
[383:30.82]That room is clear.
[383:32.14]Nobody in this one.
[383:32.94]There's just a guy up here.
[383:33.86]I gotta be careful.
[383:56.60]Big guy.
[383:57.32]Two big guys left.
[384:07.57]Nobody in that up top room?
[384:08.75]Okay.
[384:09.47]I just gotta shoot them once.
[384:13.43]I might even just pull it back.
[384:14.41]No, I should be able to get it.
[384:15.27]Okay.
[384:22.16]That leaves these two guys up top.
[384:23.98]Which, there's line of sight here.
[384:27.68]Holy fuck, I almost lost it.
[384:28.80]Okay.
[384:34.02]I'm not enough.
[384:35.96]Why would I do that right now?
[384:38.62]Don't make any dumb jokes.
[384:39.84]They're almost done with this part.
[384:44.28]Oh my god, my reaction times are so slow.
[384:47.71]They're so slow right now.
[384:51.47]My brain has to process like 400 milliseconds of lag.
[384:56.59]It's serious.
[384:59.47]I just saw that guy and it was like, please shoot guy.
[385:02.96]Oh, okay.
[385:04.96]Oh.
[385:10.28]There's only one more guy with a gun.
[385:13.68]And I've gotta get him first.
[385:24.21]Got it.
[385:24.73]Okay.
[385:25.55]Done.
[385:26.67]Oh my goodness gracious.
[385:29.80]Again, like we talked about before, man, like, I've got to give it up to the people that can play this fucking game that well.
[385:37.46]How?
[385:37.80]This is like, it's, it's so ridiculous.
[385:43.02]I'm gonna watch tonight, like, YouTube videos of guys beating this in five seconds.
[385:46.89]I'm gonna be like, what the fuck happened?
[385:49.37]You're, you're like made out of other material besides brain matter.
[386:16.62]What happened here?
[386:26.14]Where are we going?
[386:29.77]Oh, you're going... I'm about to put... I'm about to put you in the trunk?
[386:38.57]No, that's not the person that was in the trunk at the beginning of the game?
[386:51.57]Wait, where am I supposed to... Oh shit!
[387:08.15]I'm sorry, I'm like, I'm fucking fading.
[387:11.75]So...
[387:17.49]Do we go somewhere?
[387:18.41]Do I put her on the couch?
[387:28.57]Stop doing that to me, game.
[387:31.67]Put mom in front of the TV?
[387:34.09]Put mom in the chair?
[387:35.20]Put mom in a sofa?
[387:42.48]Mom, where do you want to go?
[387:43.60]I don't know where mom wants me to put her.
[387:50.03]Oh, I need to go over there.
[387:57.14]Okay, here you go, Mom.
[388:01.17]Stop getting stuck on the stairs.
[388:11.39]I must have passed out.
[388:12.27]I was going to take a bath, and then I don't remember what happened.
[388:15.27]You okay?
[388:15.49]You want me to call the doctor?
[388:16.35]No, please don't.
[388:17.55]I'm fine, I swear.
[388:18.29]Just a bit cold and tired.
[388:19.45]I'll be good as new in the morning.
[388:21.16]Are you sure?
[388:21.62]You don't look too good.
[388:22.84]I'm sure.
[388:23.28]Cough.
[388:23.74]I'd like to get some sleep now, if you don't mind.
[388:34.93]You've got one new message.
[388:35.87]Hi there, this is Dan from Bush and Flower.
[388:37.49]We've got some gardening work for you uptown.
[388:39.03]A nice old house.
[388:40.79]Up on 66.
[388:41.92]Shouldn't be too hard.
[388:42.66]It's pretty straightforward.
[388:44.48]You'll know it when you see it.
[388:46.82]Just put your suit on.
[388:48.60]Click.
[388:48.84]682 deaths.
[388:57.77]House call.
[389:11.41]Right through the window.
[389:13.41]Actually, if I'm quick enough.
[389:21.11]Ah, plenty of windows.
[389:24.77]I'm thinking through this door on the right.
[389:28.13]Nope.
[389:34.28]This whole thing is a window.
[389:42.73]Alright, what do we got?
[389:43.39]There's a guy with a gun down here.
[389:48.11]Gun.
[389:48.97]Lots of guns.
[389:50.43]Not really safe anywhere, huh?
[390:03.94]Is this a cover?
[390:05.76]I don't think it is.
[390:06.34]Whoops-a-daisy.
[390:09.89]Is this a cover?
[390:11.45]No.
[390:20.81]Nah, I'm done.
[390:22.13]I just wanted to see what this level was about.
[390:28.27]The door is covered.
[390:37.19]Oh, I pulled him.
[390:39.67]So I got a gun.
[390:40.25]Hold on.
[390:43.13]Alright.
[390:43.86]Like, the video game... What the hell was that?
[390:47.96]What was going on in that video game there?
[391:04.42]Watch out for the window.
[391:05.28]Although I can do it too, but not a good idea.
[391:07.80]Does that guy have a gun?
[391:16.89]Nope.
[391:34.15]Okay.
[391:35.85]Machine gun, machine gun.
[391:36.65]We can get in this room over here.
[391:38.98]Let's get it.
[391:41.98]I thought that was going to bump into him, but apparently not.
[391:46.16]Empty.
[391:46.50]Give me another gun.
[391:47.08]Alright, we got one, two.
[391:51.88]I might be able to knock this guy out.
[391:53.10]That's risky.
[391:55.42]Just shoot him.
[392:01.11]Okay, got it.
[392:08.62]Ooh, I couldn't do that.
[392:10.66]Oops.
[392:15.02]Wow.
[392:15.48]Okay.
[392:19.93]Wow, I gotta get that out of his hand right now.
[392:21.65]I'm gonna give it... Oh, I fucking threw it.
[392:23.43]Whoops.
[392:32.52]Fuck.
[392:32.90]No, I don't want to get on top of him.
[392:34.62]Okay, I figured it out.
[392:39.05]I gotta get the gun.
[392:40.09]I gotta... mmm.
[392:45.73]Goddamn.
[392:46.09]There comes a big guy.
[392:54.20]No, shit.
[392:54.84]Okay.
[392:55.54]I know what I gotta do.
[393:00.08]Just gotta be careful.
[393:00.78]Big guy comes out.
[393:01.38]Shoot him with a shotgun.
[393:02.12]Where did the guy with the gun come from?
[393:17.35]Okay.
[393:18.13]Watch it for that guy with the gun.
[393:20.21]I don't think I have any bolts.
[393:24.11]Damn.
[393:26.05]What do I do about this guy?
[393:36.56]Thought I hit him with the... What's over on the left?
[393:40.72]I wish I could see.
[393:55.20]I could throw it up there, but I don't know if that's a good idea.
[394:00.32]Because if I run in there, somebody could probably shoot me from up here.
[394:03.50]Damn it.
[394:03.82]And then it doesn't even matter.
[394:05.19]Damn it.
[394:19.14]Where did you come from?
[394:20.03]Whoa!
[394:20.63]Okay, I got it.
[394:21.49]But I don't have any guns.
[394:25.67]Okay, this is not a bad spot to be in.
[394:28.11]I just gotta shoot this guy once.
[394:31.97]I got it.
[394:32.23]I got it.
[394:32.61]Okay.
[394:35.88]That guy in there is gone.
[394:37.54]But what's all the- Okay, that's the end of the level.
[394:49.21]Gun, gun, gun.
[394:50.25]I don't think nobody has a gun.
[394:51.21]That guy has a gun!
[394:53.39]Wowee!
[394:54.33]That guy does have a gun, doesn't he?
[395:06.48]No more guns?
[395:07.56]Just this guy?
[395:08.08]No, there's a gun up there.
[395:16.45]Okay, I got it.
[395:17.56]I actually fucking... I shot the guy back there.
[395:25.44]Okay.
[395:26.42]It's just a bunch of chumps.
[395:32.24]In fact, give me a melee weapon.
[395:34.52]Because there's no reason for me to use... Actually, give me this.
[395:38.18]I'm more comfortable with this thing right now.
[395:40.21]So we got a bunch of guys over here.
[395:41.73]I'm just gonna try to get this dude.
[395:46.39]In fact, I'm gonna get this guy with a melee.
[395:47.91]No, I'm not.
[395:48.31]Just... Okay.
[395:55.09]Wish me luck.
[396:00.09]There's nothing else, right?
[396:14.72]Are there- is there no secrets in this game either?
[396:36.93]Plenty of secret shit.
[396:40.59]Hmm, okay.
[396:43.21]Get ready for the best level.
[396:47.19]Am I missing something here?
[396:48.42]Why am I lost already over there?
[396:53.66]Exit the game now.
[397:01.90]Exit the game now.
[397:05.80]He's gonna quit on this one.
[397:09.56]This is where I either break or I transcend.
[397:15.99]Hold on a second, gotta go fetch another notepad.
[397:18.21]Not, not yet.
[397:18.93]I'm, I mean, I'm getting to that point where I'm starting to feel it.
[397:21.73]I know we're getting, it's getting really late.
[397:24.61]It's like 2 a.m.
[397:25.31]Eastern right now.
[397:31.36]Let's see if I'll, let's see if I transcend.
[397:33.42]Okay, I'm gonna give myself like 10 attempts to transcend.
[397:37.84]And then I'm gonna, I'm gonna call it.
[397:39.94]Because I don't know how much longer my brain can take.
[397:49.10]10 is so few.
[397:49.86]Alright, 20.
[397:52.32]I'm back.
[397:54.06]So I'm in there just waiting for the trial to start, and I can tell you time moves slow when you're locked up.
[397:59.39]This one day I get a visit.
[398:04.15]That's one of these.
[398:07.83]Good afternoon.
[398:09.23]Who are you?
[398:11.59]I told you he wouldn't recognize us.
[398:15.63]Why are you here?
[398:16.71]Tying up some loose ends.
[398:19.06]Just a little precaution seems like it wasn't really necessary.
[398:22.12]I'm afraid I don't understand.
[398:23.86]Oh, we didn't expect you to.
[398:25.88]While we're here, we might as well say our goodbyes.
[398:30.50]Goodbyes.
[398:31.52]Yes, after all, you served us well.
[398:33.68]But it looks like your time's up now.
[398:37.01]Do I recognize them?
[398:40.85]Um... You'll figure it out, I'm sure.
[398:48.63]It was nice seeing you again, but I'm afraid it's time for us to leave.
[398:53.42]Is it the janitor?
[398:56.74]You take care.
[399:03.59]20th scene, release.
[399:17.25]What the hell?
[399:18.01]Say your prayers, asshole.
[399:31.10]No, no, no, no, wait.
[399:32.64]Alright, people have thrown bottles.
[399:43.33]So I get hit in the head with a bottle, right?
[400:01.00]I'm just gonna... Oh my lord!
[400:03.04]Oh, come on.
[400:13.78]What was that fucking hitbox?
[400:19.97]Survive.
[400:20.63]You must transcend.
[400:21.79]I think it's hard to transcend.
[400:35.07]Whoa!
[400:35.37]Somebody's threw a bat!
[400:41.45]I did it.
[400:45.37]What the fuck is happening?
[400:47.65]Okay.
[400:55.16]What?
[401:00.96]Oh boy.
[401:02.44]Do I just have to escape?
[401:04.88]I just have to escape, right?
[401:25.87]Anybody have a gun?
[401:28.70]Fuck.
[402:04.06]Alright, I think I'm at my boiling point.
[402:07.50]I think I've reached the point where I'm done for tonight.
[402:15.00]Holy fuck.
[402:27.45]We made a lot of progress.
[402:31.88]Yeah, I don't know if I can handle this one right now.
[402:39.86]This isn't even the worst room.
[402:41.88]My Jesus.
[402:44.75]What the hell?
[403:00.27]Who's left up there?
[403:01.85]Okay, I'm safe to go down here.
[403:03.55]I can get into the gun.
[403:06.45]I got stuck.
[403:07.01]It's alright, I'm fine.
[403:09.13]Alright.
[403:11.51]Oh, they can shoot through the window!
[403:12.77]Fuck!
[403:13.51]God, the window!
[403:15.15]Oh my lord.
[403:16.05]Alright, this is it.
[403:19.53]This is the last try.
[403:20.57]But, streaming this game again, it's like, what, an hour or two left of the whole game?
[403:47.10]Alright, let me ask you this.
[403:49.14]Is this... the... like, hardest part of this part of the game?
[403:56.35]No, just... it's... um... There's six more.
[404:01.45]Alright.
[404:01.73]Yeah, then I'll do it another night.
[404:04.77]Before I actually fucking go crazy.
[404:15.02]Alright.
[404:15.62]Now's the time, isn't it?
[404:21.42]Ugh.
[404:22.78]Transcendence delayed.
[404:23.90]When are you gonna do it again?
[404:26.98]Um, so the plan here... Yeah, I gotta stop.
[404:34.48]Unfortunately.
[404:35.16]It really is too much for my brain right now.
[404:52.82]It's about seven hours.
[404:54.97]Or I might even, you know, I might even just do... No, it's like 11.30.
[405:00.91]It's time to go.
[405:04.11]So, let me go with the plan.
[405:06.27]So, I'm not going to be streaming tomorrow or Tuesday.
[405:12.56]Because Monday and Tuesday here are actually set up completely.
[405:17.70]Hopefully, they're work days to get the Christmas stream ready to go.
[405:24.57]So I will not see you guys until Wednesday.
[405:31.20]And we will just probably... We'll probably just come back to this and try to finish it.
[405:34.26]739 deaths.
[405:40.56]I can't even... That's a number I can't even count to.
[405:45.80]And depending on how long that takes us, and depending on where that goes... Can you die one more time?
[405:51.05]Yeah, that's... Okay.
[406:12.54]That was way more than one.
[406:14.90]Alright, that's gonna be it.
[406:19.67]Thanks everybody for coming out.
[406:28.07]Getting addicted.
[406:28.83]Yeah, it's getting really, really late.
[406:30.77]It's time to go.
[406:32.19]I had a lot of fun.
[406:32.87]I did.
[406:33.33]The game's a great game.
[406:36.18]But if you want my honest, true opinion, I think Hotline Miami 1 is like a more fun game.
[406:44.08]It feels like Hotline Miami 1 was a lot of fun and it was hard, but then they made Hotline Miami 2 and they were just like, hey, let's just make it even more ridiculous.
[406:57.40]Because I loved Hotline Miami 1.
[406:59.96]That was like a fun, great experience.
[407:01.80]It was frustrating sometimes, but I feel like some of the levels in this game were just like designed to just make you hate yourself.
[407:13.78]It's still really fun, though.
[407:14.74]Like, you see how you kind of can't stop playing it.
[407:21.16]And if you like more of an extreme kind of challenge, if you like more challenge than one, then absolutely.
[407:27.62]I think they're both great games.
[407:33.64]I think they're definitely both worth playing, for sure.
[407:49.01]But, yeah, that's my opinion on it, I think.
[407:51.91]Definitely gonna finish it, and I definitely would give it a recommend.
[408:00.76]But, yeah, let's do the... Oh, we got a lot of bits.
[408:07.32]Holy shit, there's like a lot of... You guys gave a lot of money tonight, holy fuck.
[408:23.56]$158,000 raised so far.
[408:30.01]With hashtag charity.
[408:30.85]Alright, so here's what we're going to do, because it is so late, I'm going to quickly go through the bits.
[408:38.05]So I'm not going to read very many messages.
[408:41.34]I will try to pick out some, but there are eight hours of bits, and it's almost 3 a.m.
[408:49.44]Eastern Time.
[408:53.15]So, we're gonna keep people up, like, another three or four hours.
[409:00.71]So, let's go.
[409:02.25]Thanks for coming up.
[409:03.29]See you on Wednesday.
[409:07.01]And let's start with... Uh, seven hours ago.
[409:12.19]Thank you, Craft Tech, for the one dollar.
[409:15.23]Thank you... to Bitslave for the one dollar.
[409:19.33]Hey everybody, German95 here, just wanna make a quick vlog real quick.

[409:51.99]Absolutely, thank you.
[409:54.49]Hope you feel better.

[410:07.14]Alright, Jerma, do you remember this?
[410:09.66]Uh, do I remember what?
[410:12.22]Oh, the guy's like, head being punched with his face?
[410:15.68]I do.
[410:16.94]Uh, do you know the movie or series it's from?
[410:18.24]I don't know what movie that is, where the guy gets his face punched around in a circle.
[410:22.97]And if I have not watched it, I need to watch it.
[410:24.53]Uh, I don't know what it is.
[410:30.56]I remember using that gif a long time ago.
[410:33.18]Thank you, Stix Renegade, for the $1.
[410:34.56]How do you feel about the fact that thousands of people watch the stream of a DVD logo hitting the corner?
[410:39.89]What?
[410:42.63]What do you mean, the DVD logo?
[410:44.11]I don't know what that means.
[410:48.76]Uh, and Amal- and- and Amalyn, thanks for the $1.
[410:51.08]Thanks for the stream today, Jerma.
[410:52.18]Watching you scream with a hotline, too, is the best birthday gift.

[411:29.75]What?
[411:30.64]How many more of these are there gonna be?
[411:35.84]There's no more like cartoon cats that exist, right?

[411:54.73]Carrot, thanks for the $1.
[411:55.53]Good joke, you goddamn evil mastermind.
[411:57.20]I don't know what's real anymore.
[412:11.24]That's why I was late today, by the way.
[412:12.60]I was trying to, like, get that done.
[412:14.40]I was just recording that and then looping it and then putting it into OBS.
[412:18.87]Thank you, Bitslay, for the $1.
[412:20.09]Don't worry, Jeremiah.

[412:32.39]George, bye.
[412:32.81]Thank you.
[412:38.04]Garfield the Monday Killer.
[412:39.10]Here's another cat.
[412:39.74]My name's Garfield.
[412:40.28]I'm here to say Disney animation is getting pretty cray-cray seriously.
[412:42.36]Do you remember Disney animation sure is breaking new ground?
[412:44.00]Garfield's gonna say he's pretty impressed.
[412:45.44]Check out the latest Garfield scoop.
[412:46.38]I can't believe they allowed this to be there.
[412:47.36]It feels good or bad.
[412:47.96]Okay, what is it?
[412:54.17]It's Wreck-It Ralph doing the thing that the guy did when he used to dance and sing, and it was the original gnome, and now the gnome took it over, and then it's the Rick Gnome.
[413:07.40]Thank you, Garfield.
[413:09.67]But they say Disney Animation sure is breaking new ground.
[413:12.99]Uh, I can't believe they allowed that in their movie.
[413:21.43]Rick Gnome.
[413:23.75]Extra cheesy thanks for the $1.
[413:25.00]You'd be a pro at this game if your keyboard was built into your pants.
[413:27.76]I know, it's too bad I don't have one of those.
[413:31.48]Flying... Flying trolley thanks for the $1.
[413:34.38]Die, die, die.
[413:35.64]Death Eater.
[413:38.96]Uh, thank you, Bitslay, for the one dollar.
[413:40.75]Nice noise.
[413:51.67]Sounds about right.
[413:53.56]Uh, Novi, thanks for the one dollar.
[413:55.80]They say, uh... They say vigil... aunties.
[414:02.20]Vigilantes.

[414:04.04]Thank you.
[414:04.64]Chickenfoot, thanks for the fifteen dollars, Chickenfoot.
[414:09.39]Hey, Jerma.
[414:09.73]Wanted to thank you for all the great content.
[414:10.91]I've only discovered you recently, but I've been watching your backlog on YouTube.
[414:14.15]It's been really helping me stay busy while I deal with carpal tunnel.
[414:17.22]Happy holidays and don't get too mad at Hotline Miami.
[414:20.12]Hashtag charity.
[414:20.74]Thank you so much, Chickenfoot.
[414:21.86]Welcome.
[414:24.02]Uh, well, we did get very... I did... Alright, did I get mad at Hotline Miami too?
[414:28.97]Or did I, like, just... I fell down, like, the insanity hole.
[414:31.55]I don't know.
[414:31.91]I don't feel like I was very angry.
[414:36.01]I was angry, but I feel like I was not angry.
[414:39.87]Alright, whatever.
[414:40.39]I was fucking really mad.
[414:41.83]I was very angry.
[414:42.77]I was fuming.
[414:43.43]It was horrible.
[414:44.11]I felt so fucking mad.
[414:45.67]I was insane angry.
[414:53.15]I wasn't like actually physically angry.
[414:56.92]I was video game insane angry.
[415:01.59]This game does it to me, though.
[415:02.61]It's because it's so quick!
[415:03.73]It's just... It's- it's just... The game is so fast, and it's so easy to make a small mistake.
[415:12.68]Even in other, like, hard games, you can make small mistakes.
[415:16.44]You make one, it's just quick, quick, go, go, go, go, bang, bang, bang, bang, restart, go, go, go, go, go, restart, go, go, go, go, go, restart, mistake, go, go, go, restart.
[415:23.24]It's like, boom!
[415:25.78]Your brain just explodes.
[415:35.29]What made me go more insane?
[415:37.49]This or Dark Souls?
[415:39.07]Oh, definitely this.
[415:39.79]Because Dark Souls, you have time to, you know, you get hit, you fall down, you screw up, you come back.
[415:50.88]This is just, it's like a lightning round, Dark Souls.
[416:03.77]But
[416:05.24]Thank you to D-Man Fun for the $1.12.
[416:08.36]Thank you, Jerma.
[416:08.88]Thank you.
[416:10.34]Lieutenant Campbell, thanks for the $1.
[416:11.30]What are your thoughts on the new Godzilla movie coming out this summer?
[416:13.88]Hashtag charity.
[416:15.54]I think it's interesting.
[416:16.86]It's from a long time ago.
[416:17.71]I mean, those monsters, they've made those movies a long time ago.
[416:27.71]So, I think it'll be interesting.
[416:29.93]I don't know if it's going to be a good movie, but it'll be worth at least maybe checking out.
[416:37.27]Uh, but thank you Bin Hayden for the $1.00.
[416:38.91]That's really awesome, actually.
[416:39.93]I didn't even know that was in the game.
[416:41.11]That's fucking awesome.
[416:41.79]Uh, on Wednesday when we start and we complete the game, we'll go take a look.
[416:44.63]We'll go take a look at some of the community stuff on the workshop.
[417:09.38]Jerma will never look at the game again.
[417:10.74]No, I gotta beat it.
[417:12.06]I'm close enough.
[417:13.08]I'm only like two hours away from beating the whole thing.
[417:15.29]But yeah, I'll definitely check it out.
[417:21.33]Extra Cheesy, thanks for the $1.
[417:23.03]They should do a hotline game where instead of taking place in Miami, it takes place in some sort of snowy region.
[417:28.57]And there is sword fighting and dragons and magic.
[417:30.89]And then release it on every platform with four different editions.
[417:34.53]Also, I'm drawing art of you.
[417:35.71]I'll show you when I'm done.
[417:37.65]Thank you.

[417:44.67]Good night, Germo.

[417:47.45]Either way, I will see you there.
[417:50.67]I'm gonna try.
[417:51.21]Man, it looks like there will be something interesting on Christmas Eve.
[417:59.03]I'm gonna spend the next couple of days seeing just how much stuff I will be able to do.
[418:06.81]Thank you, Swiggity Swanky, for the $1.
[418:08.29]I think this is my favorite moment.

[418:19.47]It really- it's the same sound effect.
[418:23.25]Uh, Captain Morgan, thanks for the $1.
[418:24.69]Excuse you, Jerma, I can't believe you'd say such naughty words on stream.
[418:27.43]I'm telling Mom.
[418:29.63]It's okay.
[418:32.26]Uh, thank you, ShiXoxo, for the $1.

[418:45.37]Happy birthday, Flank Tank.
[418:47.27]Can everybody please say happy birthday to all the birthday boys and birthday girls in here?

[419:05.74]I spent at least an hour on the boat mission on hard mode.
[419:08.36]It's a pain.
[419:09.68]I hope you enjoyed Death Wish.
[419:12.22]Oh, I did.
[419:12.60]I did.
[419:16.94]Thank you, though.

[419:47.04]It's a bit personal here.
[419:48.28]I struggled with substance abuse for a long time.
[419:50.12]I'm coming up on three years sober.
[419:52.34]In the early days of sobriety, I found your channel and now stream.
[419:55.56]Some days are really hard and your videos have always helped me laugh and smile when I didn't feel like it.
[419:59.77]You help people more than you know just by being you.
[420:02.35]Thank you.
[420:03.55]Much love.
[420:03.97]Hashtag charity.
[420:05.01]Thank you, Dong.
[420:11.23]That's awesome that you're coming up on three years sober.
[420:15.07]Good for you.
[420:17.09]That's fucking fantastic.
[420:19.05]Hope you stick with it, stay with it.
[420:22.91]You're doing a fucking awesome job.
[420:28.22]So hell yeah.
[420:36.24]And thank you for being part of this community.
[420:43.72]That's a really fucking hard thing that you're doing.
[420:51.52]But, serious, serious much love to you.
[420:55.40]Thanks for the $5.
[421:07.75]Thank you to Tay Dole Swiftler.
[421:12.05]Thanks for the $5.
[421:16.64]Jerma is a tall streamer who did not die to pinwheel.
[421:19.20]What a god of a gamer.
[421:20.28]Seriously.
[421:25.56]Thanks.
[421:26.34]I mean, everything you said there was true.
[421:28.66]So I can't disagree with them.
[421:31.32]Jinzebo, thanks for the $1.
[421:33.55]ExtraCheesy, thanks for the $1.
[421:34.53]Whoa, Jerma, you're amazing at luring those enemies into your traps.
[421:37.99]A master baiter such as yourself must be good at chess.
[421:40.71]Also, I want to see if you fell for the joke I made or indeed a clever boy and stopped yourself.
[421:44.41]I'm just tired and I just read it and didn't even care.
[421:49.27]Uh, sevipur for the one dollar.
[421:52.17]Ice wallow.
[421:55.69]Ice wallow.
[421:57.71]Ice wallow.
[421:58.53]What is this?
[422:01.77]Is this like an emote?
[422:05.88]Oh, fuck.
[422:06.68]Wow.
[422:07.84]Wow.
[422:08.44]Wow.
[422:08.94]What?
[422:09.88]I didn't even read the next part.
[422:12.05]Ooh!
[422:12.93]And I'm tired as hell too, and I'm fucking gamer exhausted.
[422:16.25]I almost got it!
[422:18.01]Nice try, but no, no, no, no, no!
[422:24.26]Oh, no!
[422:26.38]No!
[422:27.48]No way!
[422:28.72]Thank God I didn't save the second half of that.
[422:34.64]Unbelievable.
[422:36.52]Alright, thanks!
[422:38.42]I thought it was an emote.
[422:41.67]Robo Spike, thanks for the $1.
[422:43.40]Hotline Miami 2 is like 90% baiting, luring, engaging.
[422:47.20]I know, just pretend the enemies are fish.
[422:48.72]You're a fishing pole with a gun.
[422:53.48]Yeah, it's just different and frustrating.
[422:59.01]But I still want to play it.
[423:01.51]I still want to finish it.
[423:05.94]Uh, thank you to, uh, Robospike, by the way.
[423:09.24]Thank you, Hrockle, for the $2.50.
[423:11.24]Guy through window has a 208 slash 56 KDA.
[423:15.56]It's 208.
[423:17.28]Yeah, internet, internet, uh, Jorge, thanks for the $5.
[423:29.17]Jerma, don't tell me you're miffed.
[423:33.35]I was, I was, but it's hard, like, alright.
[423:36.49]Your first Hotline Miami 2 playthrough.
[423:40.13]Was it just, like, sunshine through your window, and, mmm, this is wonderful.
[423:45.25]How many times did you, like, make a fist?
[423:51.70]You know, when you're just in your room by yourself, and you're just like, fuck this game!
[423:55.92]This game's fucking stupid!
[423:58.04]Like, you know what I mean?
[423:59.26]Like, everybody does that.
[424:09.34]Everybody just starts complaining about stuff.
[424:11.22]You try to find the one thing.
[424:12.40]Well, here's the reason.
[424:13.26]Here's the reason why the game's fucking dumb.
[424:14.74]Let me tell you.
[424:15.22]Let me tell you why they're... And there's nobody in the room with you.
[424:17.45]You're just, like, talking.
[424:18.29]You're just venting frustrations.
[424:21.51]They might not even be based in reality, you know what I mean?
[424:28.98]And then you get to the end, or you get to a part where you're like, oh, actually, no, that was fun.
[424:38.30]I do like get concerned sometimes because when I play a game like this and it's very very difficult and there's a lot of timing and you got a very precise aim and it's very hard, I always get scared and kind of sad that maybe people will take the things that I'm saying and I say like, oh this is fucking stupid, this game sucks, you know what I mean?
[424:58.38]But like it's not real.
[425:00.36]You know, I really just don't want people to think that like, oh this game is stupid.
[425:03.46]Because it's not, you know what I mean?
[425:08.13]I really hope I don't come across that way, but I always, like, feel like sometimes I could.
[425:13.05]Especially during, like, the, you know, dying 40, 50, 60 times in a row, and you just get so frustrated, and you just fucking... Fuck this, this is stupid!
[425:21.00]What about this design?
[425:22.30]What's with this design?
[425:23.24]It's like the game is fine, the game's fun.
[425:28.64]So, I hope I don't come off that way, because I feel like that would be... You know, a lot of people have... No, I don't want to come off as, like, a dick.
[425:36.26]Or, like, an annoying person, you know what I mean?
[425:39.15]That's why it's hard sometimes.
[425:47.97]It was the door's fault.
[425:51.36]Because I don't want... You know the rage gamer who's just like, Fuck you!
[425:55.34]And fuck this!
[425:56.24]And fuck this game!
[425:58.75]But just know that I don't, you know, it's all in fun and it's all in just frustration, you know?
[426:08.49]But let's keep going.
[426:10.78]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.
[426:12.08]Hey, uh, Peter, five streams in a row, can we go for six?
[426:14.72]But for real, I think you went temporarily insane.
[426:17.78]I did, I absolutely did.
[426:20.36]I definitely went insane.
[426:25.64]There's no if so there, no way.
[426:27.06]Hey, Super Hacker!
[426:28.96]Thank you for the $10, Super Hacker.
[426:30.24]Uh, I don't think you ever bore witness to this awful trash I made you last year.
[426:38.26]What?
[426:52.59]Am I, like, ready for this right now?
[426:58.86]What is this?
[426:59.46]I don't know if I'm ready for this.
[427:04.68]I don't think I'm ready for this.
[427:23.36]What the hell is that?
[427:24.32]What the fuck is going on?
[427:54.01]This is like freaking me out.
[428:36.55]Not after Hotline Miami 2.
[428:38.39]I have no reaction.
[428:40.40]I'm so drained.
[429:09.84]That was... Here it is.
[429:11.82]I feel like I didn't stop playing.
[429:18.12]But thank you, SuperHacker, for that video.
[429:21.62]That was a wild ride.
[429:23.72]That was very good, though.
[429:24.56]It was very well made.
[429:27.61]Nico gave $5 earlier.
[429:29.73]Thank you so much, again.
[429:30.83]You did it.
[429:34.23]I tried.
[429:36.23]But thank you again so much for $50.
[429:42.83]If somebody asks who Gerber is, send him that video.
[429:49.39]Hey, Timmy Timpton, thanks for the $1.
[429:50.77]Sorry to hear about your dementia, boomer.
[429:52.63]Hope you spend your last month here on this Earth having fun.
[429:55.07]Thank you, hashtag charity.
[429:56.66]Thank you, Internet Jorge, again for $15.
[430:00.58]Here, take this for better gamer gloves.
[430:06.16]Uh, this is when I was losing my fucking mind.
[430:09.65]Uh, thank you, Bang.
[430:11.93]Con- PJ Salt content is dangerously high.
[430:16.87]Yeah, that was like an hour and a half ago.
[430:19.45]I remember that.
[430:22.20]Unconquer, uh, B. Thanks for the $1.
[430:24.82]Hey, J, I'm running real low on fuel right now, so I'll make it quick.
[430:27.98]I can't tell you how much I love the streams, even though they run pretty late Eastern.
[430:31.58]They're pretty damn fun to watch.
[430:32.72]I can't wait for the Christmas stream and hope everything works out the way you want to.
[430:35.78]I plan on sticking around for much longer and await the goofs of the future.
[430:39.19]Take care and good night.
[430:40.51]P.S.
[430:40.85]Please do more facecam bits.
[430:42.17]I think I can speak for chat when I say that we adore it.
[430:46.52]Thank you.
[430:48.02]And yeah, that's why I... I may have decided to keep playing.
[430:51.74]Because I'm just sucked into it.
[430:55.05]But I am on the other side of the universe, right?
[430:58.59]For everybody.
[430:59.15]It's almost 3 a.m.
[431:01.59]I never went this late back when I was streaming in Massachusetts, so... But yeah, I'm looking forward to it, too.
[431:11.93]I hope you enjoy the Christmas Eve stream.
[431:17.41]I sincerely do.
[431:19.61]It should be fun.
[431:22.96]Thank you to... Oh, hold on.
[431:25.02]Let me get it right.
[431:28.16]Drosophila.
[431:30.14]Drosophila.
[431:33.13]See?
[431:33.69]Got it.
[431:34.63]Thanks for the $1.
[431:37.41]I hope this game doesn't ruin your perception of the series.
[431:39.39]I really dislike Hotline 2, but Hotline 1 is still a great game, and I go back to it frequently.
[431:44.39]2 is a disappointment because of all the open corridors, windows, and out-of-sight enemies, as well as your inability to choose your mask, but you can always replay 1.
[431:52.35]Hashtag charity.
[431:56.67]Thank you.
[431:59.13]Yeah, I mean, I've, uh, I said my piece on the two games.
[432:04.58]It kind of just feels like they tried to dial two up, like, like, all the way.
[432:14.32]And, I mean, it's just a challenge for people, and that's, you know, that's the way it is.
[432:21.70]You could choose the mask.
[432:23.24]Only in a couple of missions, I think.
[432:26.54]There really was only about two or three missions so far, and there's only two masks I even had the whole time.
[432:36.64]But yeah, I feel like that opinion is not like an unpopular one, though.
[432:44.16]To say that, I don't know, how split is like the Hotline Miami community?
[432:49.80]People that like love these games.
[432:53.23]It does kind of feel like a lot of people like two more.
[433:07.97]I love 2 for the story, not the gameplay.
[433:09.71]It's pretty split.
[433:15.88]I love 2, but it's more frustrating.
[433:17.48]There's still a split.
[433:18.26]There's a split, it seems.
[433:19.04]It's a good game, but the first one's... Yeah, it seems like there's a lot of people that like it.
[433:22.03]That's why, you know, it's... They're both good games.
[433:32.85]I personally, I think I enjoyed one more.
[433:36.29]If one had like a few more levels, then I would probably put it.
[433:41.48]There's so much more into, it seems like at this point, but I'm not sure.
[433:53.72]But almost done.
[433:56.40]Thank you to Graveyard Ghoul for the $1.00.
[433:58.10]An accurate depiction of Jerma after six hours of Hotline Miami.
[434:09.93]More doesn't always mean better.
[434:12.44]No.
[434:16.77]No it doesn't.
[434:20.51]All my bones are gone, John.
[434:23.49]Hey, DinkyDuper, thanks for the $1.
[434:24.90]I don't have much to say, but here it goes.
[434:26.10]Just want to say thank you for all that you do, whether it be making videos or streaming.
[434:30.46]Whenever I know there's a stream coming up the next day, it really gets me motivated.
[434:33.00]It gets me excited for the day.
[434:34.68]I love coming to chat early and seeing the community interact and talk.
[434:37.78]It really makes you feel like you're a part of something special.
[434:39.54]Anyways, that's all I wanted to say.
[434:40.60]You can go back to making birdhouses or whatever.
[434:45.24]Hashtag charity.
[434:45.90]Thank you, DinkyDuper.
[434:50.57]yeah it's great it's great I love just kind of coming to the stream and before I start because I'm usually sitting here setting something up and they're just people hanging out chatting the Discord so follow people it's wonderful I I wouldn't trade it for anything you know it's great I'm very very happy
[435:19.34]mods are sleeping it's time it's time for bed uh Saturn Saturn saturnian ocean thanks for the one dollar I've been a little bummed today because my favorite let's play channel super best friends broke up today I know it might seem silly to some people to be upset about something like that but I've been watching them for like a quarter of my life just want to thank you for still being here to cheer us all up hashtag charity
[435:46.75]Yeah, I mean, here's the thing about any type of entertainment, right?
[435:51.09]Or any type of media.
[435:53.89]When you, especially something that's long form, right?
[435:58.02]Television shows, especially, you kind of get attached.
[436:03.12]You know, you get that feeling of, oh, wow, we're in like season 12 of this show.
[436:10.24]And that's like almost a third of my whole life.
[436:15.54]And it becomes a part of, you know, who you are.
[436:21.25]So, I don't know if there's anything, I mean, you think it might sound silly to think like that, but man, you know, it's, you liked the content, you were a fan, and it was something that you watched all the time.
[436:35.04]It's not like,
[436:37.19]It's just entertainment.
[436:37.97]It's something for you to unwind with.
[436:41.54]It's like when a TV show is done.
[436:43.44]It is, oh, it's the final season of Seinfeld.
[436:49.68]That was like sad for a lot of people because it was just like, oh, well, I love this show, you know?
[436:56.43]But the one good thing about it, because we're on the world of digital media, that, and you can go back and watch any of those episodes right now.
[437:10.59]There's a lot of content that's available that you can just kind of go watch again.
[437:20.14]Really?
[437:21.06]Wait, hold on, what?
[437:23.74]I can go watch it again?
[437:25.11]Really?
[437:27.95]The all caps is what's getting me.
[437:32.21]Holy shit, the internet.
[437:35.08]But thank you, Saturn.
[437:37.34]I don't have any plans on leaving or going away or stopping anytime soon.
[437:46.13]So... I would definitely let you know.
[437:50.45]I don't know when that will be.
[437:54.21]I don't know.
[437:54.89]I'm just... I can't even give you an answer for when that would ever be.
[438:01.99]But thank you.
[438:03.21]Thank you Chromefox for the $1.
[438:04.37]Where can I buy a Gloom Man shirt?
[438:06.65]Soon, soon, soon enough, soon enough.
[438:08.99]You'll see it soon.
[438:09.79]Todd!
[438:10.63]Thank you Todd Flowered for the $1.
[438:12.81]Hey guys, where's Felix the Cat?
[438:14.51]Kappa.
[438:16.01]Hashtag charity.
[438:18.19]Somebody's gonna make it now, and then I'm gonna get, like, a three-paragraph message tomorrow about, like, Felix's world of fuckin' horns.
[438:25.24]And, like, fuckin' baskets of strawberries, whatever the hell he did.
[438:30.30]Hey Ghoul Champ!
[438:30.98]Thanks for the $3.
[438:33.36]Hard mode adds harder enemies in place of others, faster enemies, reversed levels, less doors, more windows, and your ammo is cut in half every time you pick up a weapon.
[438:40.36]It's really messed up.
[438:44.53]Damn.
[438:46.31]I don't even know.
[438:47.25]I don't even know how you would do that.
[438:52.81]It's like... That's so much.
[438:58.66]The game already is a lot, and adding that on top of it.
[439:01.80]Oh, the windows and the more enemies, faster people.
[439:06.44]Oof.
[439:11.22]But thank you for the $3.
[439:12.34]Thank you Timmy Timtan for the $1.
[439:13.32]Didn't you say something about sort of a solo podcast type thing a while back?
[439:17.12]Is that still something you want to do?
[439:19.16]Yes.
[439:22.85]2019 is going to be when I start to implement some of the things that I would like to try.
[439:29.18]I wanted to give myself at least a few months to settle here and I mean I've already done something you know in a studio or a new thing and I'm doing it again but I mean it's not like that those streams and some of those ideas haven't happened yet but I think I wanted to give myself a little bit time
[439:55.90]But that's definitely something you'll probably be seeing in 2019.
[439:59.14]Not really like a podcast, but I don't know.
[440:03.15]I have a few things that I'd like to try.
[440:04.71]We'll see.
[440:05.01]2019.
[440:07.23]No, I don't have the patience to speedrun.
[440:08.69]I don't.
[440:08.89]Even if I tried the, you know, the whole make a mistake and you lose time and you have to reset.
[440:26.15]This is the speedrun for me.
[440:27.61]Every level in Hotline Miami is like a new game.
[440:31.15]There, that is the speedrun.
[440:32.89]And try- Okay, go, go, go, go!
[440:35.31]That's the reset.
[440:38.46]But if I were to actually try to speedrun a game, I think an interesting one to do it with, um... I don't know if the Dark Souls games are just so interesting speedrun.
[440:47.84]A speedrun Dark Souls is just cool, it's fun to watch.
[440:57.12]Speedruns are about being impatient.
[441:01.87]Every time you die, you gotta play a round of Fortnite.
[441:05.83]Thank you, Varian, for the $1.
[441:07.39]Hey, Jeremy, just wanted you to know your messy Hotline Miami stress hair was looking good today.
[441:11.05]Thanks for the stream.
[441:12.37]Thank you.
[441:13.71]And then CluelessSniper, thanks for the $1.
[441:14.98]And Siroc, thanks for the $1 to end it.
[441:18.38]CluelessSniper says, hey, Jeremy, Felix the cat here.
[441:21.28]Just kidding.
[441:21.70]Thanks for the fun stream and help me cope with super best friends breaking up.
[441:27.26]Well, I'm glad that you can find at least some fun here on a day that's not... You know, you're watching some... They're YouTubers, right?
[441:37.11]I'm sorry that you were big fans and that now you kind of... Their show or whatever is not happening anymore.
[441:44.94]I don't know the details, but... I don't really know them at all.
[441:54.60]I just knew that they did videos, so...
[441:58.68]And Ciroc thinks, hey, Jerry, the FBI closing in.
[442:01.66]It's only a matter of time until you're behind bars.
[442:03.60]Justice for Santa.
[442:07.18]Don't worry.
[442:08.04]Everything's going to be fine.
[442:11.46]Thank you, Bet3, for the $5.
[442:12.44]Hi, Jeremy.
[442:14.04]Hi.
[442:15.32]Thanks for $5.
[442:17.18]And thanks for the enormous amount of support tonight.
[442:19.12]There was a ton of messages, tons of money.
[442:24.35]Thanks a lot, guys.
[442:26.47]Let's run the subcredits, why don't we, and see how many of you guys have subscribed or resubscribed.
[442:35.21]Let's take a look.
[442:37.99]Here comes a list of all a bunch of great people that constantly support this stream.
[442:42.50]I mean, it's fucking amazing.
[442:43.80]Thank you.
[442:44.26]That's all I can say.
[442:48.15]No, I just got here.
[442:49.10]Well, you've got... You've got, like, four hours of, hey, this is fun, and I'm having, like, a great time, and it's hard.
[442:56.20]Then you've got, like, an hour and a half of, I don't even know, I don't even know what to say.
[443:01.04]This is, I don't, this is, like, fucking dumb, and what is this?
[443:03.98]Who made this?
[443:05.42]And then, like, another hour of, should I keep going?
[443:08.27]Should I keep going?
[443:10.23]And then a bunch of loud, like, grovelly in my throat noises.
[443:21.84]I really went through all stages.
[443:32.19]It was fun.
[443:32.69]No, I had a good time.
[443:34.99]Look, just because you get frustrated and annoyed at a video game because it's hard, I mean, that's what's going to happen.
[443:42.31]Doesn't mean I didn't have fun on the stream.
[443:43.95]I had a great time on the stream.
[443:44.99]The stream was fucking a lot of fun.
[443:46.95]It's always fun.
[443:48.25]Don't you know?
[443:48.91]Don't you understand?
[443:57.73]I was... Okay, I was wondering what I was hearing.
[444:02.11]I thought my stream was fucked up.
[444:03.48]That's the hotline... Okay, there we go.
[444:05.02]That's better.
[444:07.22]It's just been a heartbeat the whole time.
[444:14.58]Local streamer frustrates himself into highly accurate Tom Waits impression.
[444:22.71]I don't know, man.
[444:23.33]There was a part in the middle there where I don't even remember what I was saying.
[444:30.72]I was just blind.
[444:32.60]Just saying anything that was in my head.
[444:43.41]Did I complete the whole game?
[444:44.35]No, I did not.
[444:46.11]I have about two hours left and we're gonna finish it on Wednesday.
[444:57.00]I'm on the prison level.
[445:00.13]Stress-induced amnesia.
[445:05.76]Uh, UpQuark just came in with a doll.
[445:07.24]Uh, can you make a sound clip so I can make it my alarm to wake up?
[445:10.12]Weird request, but I think it would be interesting.
[445:11.72]Yeah, sure.
[445:17.04]It's time to get up!
[445:18.26]UpQuark!
[445:18.91]It's time to get up, Quark!
[445:20.57]It's time to get up, Quark!
[445:35.36]Or if you want a softer one that's not as crazy.
[445:50.75]It's time to rise.
[445:53.25]The day is just beginning.
[445:56.45]Please, get out of bed.
[445:58.25]And brush your fucking teeth.
[446:01.89]And comb your fucking hair.
[446:03.93]And take a fucking shower.
[446:15.33]Okay.
[446:16.31]See you on Wednesday.
[446:24.00]Now do a clown one.
[446:24.86]Okay.
[446:25.92]Hey, hey, it's time to get up.
[446:27.18]It's a clown.
[446:28.92]It's time for you to get up.
[446:29.74]It's the morning time.
[446:30.67]What are you, crazy?
[446:35.13]I'm getting out of here.
[446:36.67]I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[446:41.15]Haha, clown.
[446:42.29]God damn it.
[446:42.99]Alright, bye.
[446:43.59]I'll see you Wednesday.
[446:44.25]Have a great couple of days, though.
[446:45.81]I'll see you soon.
