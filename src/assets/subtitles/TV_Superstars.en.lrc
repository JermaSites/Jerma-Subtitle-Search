[00:30.34]Calibrate the PlayStation Move controllers.
[00:33.66]Each motion... Okay, I need both motion controllers?
[00:36.68]You didn't fucking tell me that, game.
[00:37.92]I thought I needed one.

[24:57.69]Time for your big line.
[24:59.97]Somebody get the slogan ready, please.
[25:06.17]Toilet Sheriff, it's high noon for gamers.
[25:08.92]Get germs.
[25:17.18]You took out all the enemies.
[25:19.08]Let's see your hero pose, superstar.
[25:21.66]Looking good.
[25:22.74]OK, well done, everyone.
[25:24.52]That's a wrap.
[25:33.39]I beat the top score to see your advertisement in a commercial.
[25:37.31]I win.
[25:38.43]I beat him.
[25:44.55]I win.
[25:45.51]Darling, superb performance.
[25:48.37]That commercial is coming soon to a TV near you.
[25:52.04]We have to do one more to see the commercial.
[25:54.84]Life is pain.
[25:55.88]I hate... Oh, my PlayStation camera.
[26:03.49]Why is my camera, like, falling down?
[26:06.93]What the fuck?
[26:11.55]That's it, everybody.
[26:13.17]I'm out of here.
[26:14.41]Some of us have awards to accept.
[26:16.68]Suki, red dress, please, for the red carpet.
[26:19.00]I had to take it so it wouldn't fall.
[26:21.32]Okay, there we go.
[26:28.40]So we have to do one more so we can see...
[26:36.45]Toilet Sheriff, it's high noon for gamers.
[26:39.19]Get germs.
[26:50.31]Oh, I didn't know it was gonna happen right there.
[27:00.64]That was awful.
[27:08.46]That's my, like, signature.
[27:09.56]Oh my god.
[27:13.08]I want that fucking billboard.
[27:15.58]I want that billboard outside my house.
[27:20.98]I did one commercial.
[27:23.06]I made two pancakes and did one toilet brush commercial and I'm on a fucking billboard in Las Vegas.
[27:30.33]That's all it takes, boys and girls.
[27:31.59]That's all it takes to be famous.
[27:33.35]It's real easy.
[27:46.32]Rockstar or DIY Raw?
[27:48.48]I mean, there's a... We've got to at least try a couple.
[27:51.86]Come on.
[27:52.18]We've got to give this a little bit of a chance.
[27:54.18]Paris.
[27:54.56]I don't know what this is, but we're going Paris.
[28:00.04]It's a fashion show.
[28:02.36]Perfect.
[28:08.34]Fucking loser sits by himself.
[28:11.74]Hey.
[28:25.96]Wife is pain!
[28:27.54]I hate- Bonjour, darlings!
[28:30.94]Here we are backstage in Paris!
[28:33.60]Pressure's on!
[28:35.12]Let's see our contestants' outfits!
[28:40.96]Press the move button to remove clothes and throw them in the bin.
[28:49.58]What?
[28:49.76]I'm gonna take a stripper?
[28:50.76]What?
[28:53.22]Stop the clock with the right outfit to receive a time bonus.
[28:56.90]Contestants have to memorize the outfit.
[28:59.32]That's not me.
[29:01.35]That's not me.
[29:05.05]Who's that?
[29:08.49]That was a different guy's face.
[29:16.19]A quick change is vital for fashion show success.
[29:20.25]Santa Claus books.
[29:28.68]Clothes off first.
[29:30.28]Don't worry, I've seen it all before.
[29:33.34]How do I wear these?
[29:36.00]No, no, take the others off first.
[29:39.24]What?
[29:40.88]You want to wear two of everything?
[29:42.84]Dress first.
[29:44.37]Oh, goddammit, I gotta... Oh my god.
[29:50.11]Only 47 seconds.
[29:52.07]Put these on!
[29:54.47]Okay, good.
[29:56.45]You need to take the others off first.
[30:08.21]Madonna mia!
[30:09.54]I thought you had Skye!
[30:10.72]We're doing a Christmas special!
[30:11.98]Shut up!
[30:12.30]Fresh first, darling!
[30:13.64]Have a look at the others.
[30:16.72]No, no, no!
[30:17.56]That's not the right look!
[30:19.42]It's a crazy look!
[30:22.48]Who knows?
[30:23.56]The audience may love it.
[30:29.02]Wannabe.
[30:31.64]Ciao, and welcome to our makeover studio.
[30:34.99]Makeup studio.
[30:35.55]Time to make you look even more beautiful.
[30:40.29]Okay.
[30:44.61]Why does he have to do this every time?
[30:45.91]I have to apply makeup.
[30:49.45]Be sure to remember this cutting edge look.
[30:52.53]Oh no, I gotta put a bunch of makeup on.
[30:55.44]Hair mousse.
[31:00.82]Okay, we got a minute here.
[31:05.80]Superstar hair.
[31:10.76]Okay, that's all it takes to have, like, nice hair.
[31:15.80]All right.
[31:18.30]What was it?
[31:19.18]We gotta, like, up here, right?
[31:22.24]Oh, fuck.
[31:23.52]I didn't know it was gonna... It was, like, orange up here.
[31:34.60]It looks like I just ate a bunch of fucking Oreos.
[31:37.46]And then I... Where's the powder?
[31:39.16]Orange, like... Okay, that's good.
[31:44.81]There was orange and then there was powder over here.
[31:47.49]I see!
[31:48.49]Yeah, go for it!
[31:50.91]Okay, then a little bit of makeup wipe right here just to get that excess off.
[31:56.52]Are you sure that's your color?
[31:59.68]Even the smallest mistakes are fatal at this stage.
[32:09.59]I'm trying to write murder on my forehead.
[32:12.75]Okay, we're good.
[32:19.31]Okay.
[32:30.79]We're pretty fucked up.
[32:31.63]The spotlights are shining.
[32:33.25]The fashion world's awaiting.
[32:35.83]Let's show them what we can do.
[32:41.70]Now I gotta get on there and I gotta dance, right?
[32:52.85]are terrible.
[32:55.03]I'll show you.
[32:55.45]Look, we might not be the most attractive, we might not be the best makeup done to our face, but we got the moves.
[33:02.10]We got the moves.
[33:03.10]Guaranteed.
[33:03.78]Here we go.
[33:05.12]I'm pointing at the fucking screen to make sure that you're in camera view.
[33:24.94]Life is pain!
[33:26.50]I hate- Why can't I- Why wouldn't you let me record something else?
[33:42.23]Did I take my makeup off because it was too bad?
[33:46.32]Why can't I record two or three so it's not the same one every time?
[34:05.32]Look at Jim Carrey.
[34:10.84]I'm afraid this model's going out of fashion.
[34:13.69]Shut up.
[34:16.01]I still do the Hulk Hogan.
[34:18.83]I can't do this.
[34:20.27]I just did the fucking Ultimate Warrior.
[34:55.33]Where's my makeup job?
[34:56.56]That's what I want to do.
[35:24.45]Have you guys ever seen a fashion show where one person stood on the stage and fucking danced for ten minutes?
[35:30.52]Never.
[35:32.00]What is this insane thing we're perpetuating to our younger kids?
[35:36.30]We want a generation of fucking crazy people?
[35:41.67]It's not all about you.
[35:43.31]It's about the little people backstage that are waiting.
[35:45.61]It's not all about you.
[35:54.53]Life is pain I'm so happy about it
[36:23.02]All right, I think it's time to move on.
[36:29.06]Should we even see the other couple of ones to do?
[36:34.38]Is it worth it?
[36:35.74]I've been Randy Darling, and you've been fashion-tastic.
[36:41.64]Join us next time for another fabulous episode of Rockstar.
[36:47.76]This show was sponsored by TV Superstars Magazine.
[36:58.97]Life in Spain!
[37:00.01]I thought it was going to play right there.
[37:04.50]All right.
[37:05.04]We've got to do one more.
[37:13.20]Not again.
[37:15.35]Toilet Sheriff.
[37:16.59]It's high noon for gamers.
[37:18.09]Get germs.
[37:21.73]God damn it.
[37:24.53]Uh... Why did they play the same commercial again?
[37:28.27]Twice in a row?
[37:28.87]Are you gonna do us like that?
[37:37.47]Howdy, gamers.
[37:40.42]Alright, we got DIY Raw and Let's Get Physical.
[37:46.12]What do you think?
[37:46.90]DIY Raw or Let's Get Physical?
[37:48.92]Which one are we going out on?
[37:51.36]You can do a new commercial?
[38:14.60]Welcome to the Super Television Acting Agency.
[38:18.44]I'm Vivian Katzenberg, and I call the shots.
[38:22.96]This studio is where I make or break celebrities.
[38:26.93]So let's hope you're a class act.
[38:29.45]Time is money, honey.
[38:30.95]Let's go sell a product.
[38:33.54]So, which commercial are we recording today?
[38:36.16]Alright, we're doing Hong Deodorant.
[38:43.85]Skip!
[38:46.61]Hong Deodorant.
[38:48.89]You smell.
[39:03.93]Here's your motivation.
[39:05.71]You smell.
[39:08.29]You're sad.
[39:11.27]Everybody hates you.
[39:13.63]I love it.
[39:14.47]Okay, you're doing great.
[39:16.26]Let's see the product.
[39:17.90]Ready to catch the can.
[39:19.70]And again.
[39:20.62]One more time.
[39:22.38]I want some action shots.
[39:24.06]To spray, you need to hold the T button while you make your move.
[39:27.74]That's right.
[39:29.25]Hold it down and spray.
[39:33.46]Very nice.
[39:34.38]I don't even use deodorant.
[39:35.90]I smell perfect every day.
[39:37.40]Oh, yeah.
[39:39.34]Smooth.
[39:40.42]If you use this much deodorant, you're the guy in the fucking train.
[39:43.67]You're the guy on the subway that everybody hates to be around because you spray the whole can on yourself.
[39:46.89]Don't do that.
[39:48.03]One spurt is all you need.
[39:49.75]You don't need to hold the fucking button down.
[39:51.47]Just like once or twice all you want.
[39:53.41]You're fine.
[39:53.83]Yeah, spray it all over.
[39:55.89]Absolutely.
[39:56.49]I don't want to do this.
[39:57.35]That is truly stink.
[39:59.81]You're a star.
[40:08.23]That was hot.
[40:08.65]I'm putting deodorant on my clothes, too.
[40:12.07]Oh, here we go.
[40:12.45]Now, let's record your dialogue.
[40:15.33]Just read the autocue, sweetie.
[40:22.18]Don't buy this product.
[40:23.50]It's a fucking scam.
[40:31.80]Now you smell great, you look great, you feel great.
[40:37.27]Nice job.
[40:40.25]All right, let's watch the commercial.
[40:45.57]The reverse sell-off.
[40:49.32]Oh, no, I'm a C-list celebrity.
[40:50.66]Why did he show me that?
[41:02.88]What did it show me that for?
[41:06.66]What, I failed?
[41:07.34]It's not going to show it?
[41:08.03]Are you serious?
[41:11.27]I failed the commercial.
[41:13.03]Well, I unlocked a burrito, I guess.
[41:15.61]I opened up the tacos.
[41:17.69]That's cool.
[41:21.34]I didn't do well enough.
[41:22.24]Well, that's unfortunate.
[41:28.24]Hey, remember when I nailed that commercial that time?
[41:31.78]I'm, like, living in the past.
[41:34.33]Hey, you guys remember... Do you guys remember when I made that Rat Burger video?
[41:38.11]Oh, that was... I loved that video.
[41:39.45]Remember that video?
[41:40.97]I nailed that video.
[41:41.87]I'm gonna spray some germs.
[41:53.58]Wow, you're cooking up a storm.
[41:56.20]You've unlocked another recipe in Big Beat Kitchen.
[42:00.12]No, we're not doing that again.
[42:03.86]What a piece of crap.
[42:10.21]I am like burning up in here, by the way.
[42:14.21]All right, DIY raw was the one that everyone said we were going to do last.
[42:59.69]Life is pain!
[43:00.49]I hate... I was waiting for... Never mind.
[43:02.31]Never mind.
[43:03.03]I better be rapping on this show.
[43:05.81]I was waiting for it to...
[43:29.42]Damn it.
[43:31.20]Never mind.
[43:31.78]I've made a start in here, clearing off the old plaster.
[43:36.88]Well, easy, easy, easy.
[43:39.20]She just reverse broke that.
[43:41.84]Job done.
[43:43.46]The other walls are down to you.
[43:46.48]And mind you don't break anything.
[43:48.20]Okay.
[43:50.66]What is this accent?
[43:51.92]God damn it, now it shows up.
[43:53.44]Ah, fucking come on.
[43:55.63]Come on.
[43:57.56]I wanted to be like right here when this came up, and I thought it was going to come up way, that's why I was silent.
[44:01.48]It was going to be like this.
[44:04.89]This game sucks.
[44:11.71]We're done with this, by the way.
[44:13.85]It's just a bunch of more gimmicks.
[44:15.37]I don't wanna do any more gimmicks.
[44:16.47]We saw the gimmick and now the gimmick is over.
[44:17.89]We're done with the gimmicks.
[44:19.65]Off you go.
[44:20.13]Let's clear that plaster.
[44:21.36]Okay, smash it.
[44:22.18]Never mind you.
[44:23.58]That's going to ruin the float.
[44:25.46]See that leaf?
[44:25.88]What was coming out of my nose?
[44:26.70]What was coming out of my nose?
[44:27.38]The owners are going to love you.
[44:28.80]What happened when I was like sneezing?
[44:30.34]What the fuck was that?
[44:37.69]Okay, be very careful with that brickwork.
[44:42.51]Good!
[44:43.31]I love to see people hard at work.
[44:47.19]Uh... Mind that section, or you'll go right through.
[44:51.61]Be careful not to bash a hole there!
[44:53.15]You don't- this is not how you take plaster down!
[44:57.03]You use vinegar in a spray bottle!
[44:58.41]What are you doing?
[44:59.09]That's a water pipe!
[45:01.15]You don't use a sledgehammer!
[45:03.91]Excellent!
[45:04.76]Keep bashing away!
[45:07.20]That's how you do it.
[45:07.76]This should... Yeah, well, the studio will pay for it.
[45:11.12]Use vinegar in a spray bottle.
[45:12.65]You can bring it down to plaster.
[45:17.19]They make sure... You go to Home Depot, you can buy, like, plaster acid.
[45:19.09]You just drizzle it on there, and it'll melt off.
[45:40.67]or you'll make a hole.
[45:41.61]All right, good enough, come on.
[45:44.26]Pick up the piece now, time's nearly up.
[45:49.20]Get me out of this.
[45:51.16]We're done, cool.
[45:52.94]Don't give me a new walk.
[45:54.78]Well, that was hardly a promising start.
[46:00.38]Oh my God, I failed it.
[46:02.56]Now we gotta paint.
[46:06.08]I couldn't even reach it.
[46:07.06]Modern chic.
[46:07.42]What are you talking about?
[46:08.36]It's a masterpiece.
[46:10.59]As for the rest, do it yourself.
[46:13.61]Oh, DIY raw.
[46:14.79]I don't need to do this every time.
[46:21.73]Unnecessary.
[46:23.10]Close the curtains.
[46:24.06]Troubleshoot.
[46:29.48]Let's go.
[46:32.40]Farquaad.
[46:35.14]Is Farquaad in Shrek?
[46:37.18]Get slopping that paint on.
[46:38.76]Are you painting Farquaad's house?
[46:46.07]What color is it supposed to be?
[46:56.76]Shit!
[46:57.18]It's supposed to be... Wait, I don't understand.
[47:03.48]Why would you paint your house like urine yellow?
[47:07.64]I don't understand this.
[47:10.97]Honey, what color do you want the walls to be?
[47:12.95]Oh, I don't know, make it look like we fucking pissed all over the walls.
[47:21.93]How much time do I have?
[47:26.30]Get in there.
[47:26.80]We got time.
[47:34.94]I'm assuming this is what I need to do, right?
[47:41.90]this is correct right not bad it's not bad I'm okay with this job this really is DIY
[48:05.79]No painter's tape.
[48:07.45]This is doing freehand drunk.
[48:10.09]Yeah, good idea.
[48:11.43]Just go get some Bayer fucking expensive ass paint.
[48:18.85]What a great job.
[48:23.62]All right, three, two, one, end it.
[48:25.20]Let's see.
[48:30.95]Oh dear, it's like working with Laurel and Hardy.
[48:36.99]How are you supposed to do that reliably?
[48:38.51]Let's see how our teams are scoring.
[48:39.85]Did I get one point or over a thousand points?
[48:47.34]Okay, this is where the fridge is going.
[48:49.70]So we need to lay some good, solid floorboards.
[48:52.64]Here's how.
[48:53.56]Come on.
[49:00.39]Simple as that.
[49:01.81]It's all yours.
[49:05.53]Got it.
[49:08.09]Got ya!
[49:20.44]Take this.
[49:30.27]Saw the planks with the saw, and why am I still playing this game?
[49:38.08]What do I need to do?
[49:43.46]I didn't even look at the instructions.
[49:48.72]I'm whipping myself with this fucking stupid thing.
[49:52.27]I am whipping my neck.
[49:53.43]I'm gonna have like fucking bruises on my neck.
[49:59.03]I'm hitting myself in the face with a string.
[50:03.03]Look at this.
[50:03.93]A skilled carpenter at work.
[50:07.33]Three more, and you're done.
[50:09.13]Three more?
[50:10.09]Three more?
[50:11.49]I don't want to do one more.
[50:12.63]What if we just, like, gyrate it a little bit?
[50:16.54]You know what I mean?
[50:17.00]Like this.
[50:18.30]No.
[50:18.60]It's going to be full.
[50:22.02]Put the strap on.
[50:22.80]And the strap is on.
[50:23.70]It's like the skin.
[50:25.20]The residual skin.
[50:31.48]I can't even get one done!
[50:33.55]Get the... It's not this hard to do this in real life.
[50:37.25]Oh my lord.
[50:43.14]Let's get that fridge into place.
[50:44.50]Hmm.
[50:48.26]Well...
[50:50.05]You'd better just hope that holds.
[50:53.79]DIY.
[50:54.15]Look at my DIY house, guys.
[50:56.66]I did a good job.
[50:57.00]That's going to look like a million dollars.
[50:59.28]Over to you to finish the design.
[51:01.22]Okay.
[51:02.60]Design.
[51:03.24]Okay.
[51:04.27]All right.
[51:04.59]Let's see this design.
[51:05.43]Let's finish it.
[51:06.31]Sounds good.
[51:07.01]I can't wait.
[51:18.29]Okay, we're ruining this person's house.
[51:21.99]Hold the T button to spray.
[51:23.07]Use the spray can to paint.
[51:24.79]Spray across the stencil.

[53:29.85]We need those tiles up on the wall.
[53:32.01]I don't know where this is supposed to go.
[53:34.35]Don't just stick them anywhere.
[53:37.78]I don't even know what this image is supposed to be.
[53:40.66]Let alone what position it's supposed to be in.
[53:43.30]Are you happy with that one?
[53:45.41]Because I'm not.
[53:47.25]I gotta get a bit.

[53:54.33]Mind where you're putting that one.
[53:55.43]This is a toenail.
[53:57.60]That was just a monster's toenail.
[53:59.82]Like a kangaroo foot.
[54:02.84]Don't just stick them anywhere.
[54:06.89]Hey, look, this is a monster's toenail.

[81:49.53]Alright, press T, Matthew, I don't see how I know how to do it.
[81:51.35]I'm pretty experienced at this point, I think.
[81:58.67]It's a secret football training lab.
[82:00.99]You're going to show them some crazy skills.
[82:04.53]Fuck that up, sorry.
[82:05.51]You're tricking with a ball.
[82:08.38]You're the super athlete.
[82:10.06]You're the hero.
[82:10.44]You're the hero.
[82:11.38]You're the super athlete.
[82:12.36]You're the hero.

[82:45.22]This ball is under orders.
[82:47.66]Stop!
[82:48.80]Let's try something crazy.
[82:50.64]Something crazy.
[82:52.58]And there, and back.

[82:59.64]Let's try something really unbelievable now.
[83:02.20]Come on.
[83:03.06]You're very convincing.
[83:04.96]I'm really feeling it.
[83:07.62]Send the stuntman home.
[83:09.19]We don't need him.
[83:16.32]I'm clearly matching the screen.
[83:20.91]I didn't win.
[83:26.73]It doesn't matter.
[83:29.85]Pick shots.
[83:30.37]It's the state of mind.
[83:32.65]I give up.
[83:33.47]I'm never going to try to be an actor ever again.
[83:35.65]Fuck this whole thing.
[83:37.83]People will beg to buy when they see these last shots.
[83:40.89]You're a hero.
[83:42.13]You're flying into the air.
[83:44.19]You're unstoppable.
[83:46.35]You're a soccer superstar.
[83:49.65]That's a wrap, people.
[83:50.70]I didn't do it.
[83:53.36]I hit the 49.
[83:54.12]No.
[83:54.42]Skip it.
[83:54.80]Do it again.
[83:56.02]Come on.
[83:58.18]How did I miss that much stuff?
[84:01.98]Good.

[84:04.22]Yeah, I know.
[84:04.90]I know.
[84:05.24]I know.
[84:05.58]Do it again.
[84:09.63]I have to do that one.
[84:12.55]Did they not care about the voice line?
[84:14.27]No, you can say whatever you want.
[84:16.97]I have to win.
[84:18.57]We need more commercials available for me.
[84:24.17]Why would anyone make an ad for soccer in general, just like soccer or football?
[84:29.96]No, it's for the shoes, I think.
[84:35.30]Did I lose my billboard?
[84:36.22]No, I'm still there.
[84:36.82]I'm still there with my creepy magician billboard.
[84:49.84]If I get it and I get to the fucking end, I got a joke for you.
[84:54.96]I got a joke for you.
[84:55.82]If I can get to the end of a recorded voice line, don't worry, I got something for you.
[85:07.07]Do it again.
[85:08.77]Get it right this time.
[85:09.65]Come on.
[85:17.29]It's just so finicky.

[85:26.88]No more dicking around.
[85:32.36]No more dicking around.
[85:44.11]I'm trying as hard as I can here.
[85:46.63]It's a secret football training lab.
[85:48.91]You're going to show them some crazy skills.
[85:53.47]You're tricking with the ball.
[85:56.39]You're the super athlete.
[85:58.40]You're the hero.
[86:00.38]Come on, work it.
[86:06.12]Keep going.
[86:10.04]Try that.
[86:11.68]Now you're really going for it.
[86:14.22]This ball is under orders.
[86:16.08]Stop!
[86:18.02]Let's try something crazy.
[86:21.60]And there.
[86:22.98]And back.
[86:24.05]The instruments are going crazy.
[86:28.67]Let's try something really unbelievable now.
[86:32.09]You're very convincing.
[86:33.95]I'm really feeling it.
[86:36.69]Send the stuntman home.
[86:38.19]We don't need him.
[86:46.56]This doesn't make any sense.
[86:49.67]This doesn't make any sense.
[86:55.95]Nothing about this makes sense.
[86:58.47]It's either too fast, too slow, it don't... Kick shots.
[87:02.47]It's a state of mind.
[87:06.97]People will beg to buy when they see these last shots.
[87:09.91]You're a hero.
[87:11.15]You're flying into the air.
[87:13.21]You're unstoppable.
[87:15.37]You're a soccer superstar.
[87:18.67]That's a wrap people.
[87:29.80]Fuck.
[87:31.70]We're going back to the toothpaste.
[87:41.55]I'm not even wearing the shoes.
[87:43.03]Ah, the shoes.
[87:45.19]No, not next.
[87:45.73]I have to get one more commercial one.
[87:47.74]Have to.
[87:49.82]Stop being bad.
[87:50.72]I don't think you understand.
[87:53.22]It don't matter how I do this.
[87:54.94]It's just like it's like a random number generator if it's going to work.
[88:00.48]It's not about being bad.
[88:02.31]It's OK.
[88:02.79]Do you remember when I fucking did that one thing?
[88:04.59]Remember that?
[88:07.03]Remember my fucking TF2 video with the Battle of the Brainless Bots?
[88:09.89]Remember when I did that like seven years ago?
[88:14.99]I remember that one.
[88:17.25]How good was that video?
[88:28.78]You think this is the next game?
[88:29.64]There's a lot of next games, but I'm not sure if we're gonna play them tonight.
[88:35.29]I have to get one more commercial.
[88:37.79]Have to.
[88:38.07]We're gonna go with one of the easy ones.
[88:45.35]I still have a shitload of PlayStation 3 games to play.
[88:47.57]Welcome to the Super Television Acting Agency.
[88:50.11]I actually have that game, and the commercial thing was easy?

[92:04.96]Let's see how that one came out.
[92:27.41]They're holding me hostage and making me film these commercials.
[92:30.43]That wasn't as funny as I thought it was going to be.
[92:44.96]I don't know.
[92:45.64]That was okay, I guess.
[92:54.40]If you were the editor, why would you put that in?
[92:56.13]Why would that be the final thing you put in?
[93:02.85]That's the finished product of the commercial.
[93:04.47]Why wouldn't you just make me say something else?
[93:08.24]Oh, there I am.
[93:13.93]You've ruined it with the end.
[93:15.19]It needed to be more concise.
[93:17.55]Well, no, they were like, shut me up.
[93:19.27]I got like punched.
[93:20.19]I was like in the chair tied up.

[93:33.72]I don't know.
[93:35.51]How do you get to be like an A-list on Twitch TV?
[93:38.47]What does it take?
[93:44.76]All right, this is Let's Get Physical Reloaded.
[93:46.82]Let's try to get to A-list.
[93:47.76]It's the last thing we can do.
[94:00.73]Come on.
[94:03.97]Jeremy has an A-list streamer with a laughing emote.

[94:25.32]I'm sick of hearing that now.
[94:27.24]I don't want to hear that anymore.
[94:30.95]How do I turn that off?
[94:45.02]And I lost my train of thought, forget it.
[94:47.35]I was gonna make like a streamer joke and then it's over, forget it.
[94:49.63]It threw me off.
[95:01.72]Star Strike, okay, how do I do this?
[95:14.93]This is where I gaze at my favorite stars.
[95:19.25]And then knock him down.
[95:22.77]But he makes the screamer chill.
[95:24.14]Aw, that sucks.
[95:25.12]And myself.
[95:26.94]Can you do better?

[95:31.90]What do you mean guns?
[95:33.72]Time for some hardcore tennis.
[95:35.68]Oh, OK.
[95:36.00]I heard them say, like, take out a gun.
[95:40.84]That was, like, scary for a second.
[95:41.92]I was like, wait, hold on.
[95:42.62]It's going with guns?
[95:43.16]What the fuck?

[95:52.11]What?
[95:52.31]What's going on?
[95:53.53]I don't have any teammates.
[95:55.97]I don't have to worry about that.
[95:57.79]Grab 15.
[96:06.46]Got it.
[96:15.08]Fast hero action.
[96:16.12]Good.
[96:16.64]Give me the A-list.
[96:17.73]Give me the A-list so I can stop playing the game.
[96:21.21]Don't do it.
[96:22.03]Two for the stars.
[96:22.69]20 people this time.
[96:23.57]I got it.
[96:24.63]I'm gonna do it.
[96:25.29]I was pretty good at the wait.
[96:29.10]Life is pain!
[96:30.28]Wait, wait, wait!
[96:32.02]No, wait!

[97:26.76]That's such a distraction.
[97:35.64]It's alright.
[97:36.52]You know what?
[97:37.27]I'm okay with being a B streamer.
[97:40.37]I don't get like 20,000 concurrent viewers.
[97:44.35]That's okay.
[97:45.35]I can be a B minus streamer.
[97:47.31]I'm okay with that.
[97:47.97]I don't have to make it to A-list.
[97:49.91]I don't have to be A-list.
[98:04.48]B minus loser.
[98:06.56]Hey, come on.
[98:07.20]Okay, for this next challenge, we're going to need some help from a buddy of mine.
[98:11.64]Hey, Renoir, get yourself out of here, man.
[98:13.34]You mean me, the only person here?
[98:14.43]Here comes the funny robot.
[98:18.55]Hey, watch where you're going, Mechanical Dude.

[98:34.08]So I gotta paint.
[98:36.68]Oh, hold on a minute.
[98:39.66]So you gotta color it in?
[98:43.39]Splouting down paint is fun, but you gotta keep listening to... You know I'm acting up.
[98:50.14]You get the picture, dudes?
[99:08.12]I'm leaning in like I need glasses.
[99:10.02]Grab what?
[99:11.20]Grab?
[99:11.80]I don't understand.
[99:13.40]I hate this guy.
[99:14.62]This guy's freaking out.
[99:16.02]We're going underwater.
[99:17.44]Is it saying, oh shit?
[99:18.88]Why is it saying, oh shit?
[99:41.41]I got a paintbrush.
[99:46.73]This is gonna be hard.
[99:47.76]This is gonna actually be hard.
[99:53.34]I can't even see that.
[99:54.24]I need glasses so bad.

[100:06.03]Color change.
[100:06.51]He's going to yellow.
[100:08.11]No, that's wrong.
[100:11.58]Why is there a fucking big fat clump?
[100:14.56]Color change red.
[100:15.50]What happened?
[100:16.88]What the, what are you talking about?
[100:54.30]I'm concentrating so hard.
[100:56.70]How many points do I need?
[101:00.29]DICKHEAD!
[101:01.33]I am so angry at that.
[101:02.69]I'm actually angry.
[101:11.25]I don't even think about it.
[101:18.46]Yeah, really good sixth grader.
[101:20.34]No, not even.
[101:20.90]This is fucking terrible.
[101:26.95]That's okay.
[101:34.70]We did all right.
[101:36.40]On our fucking fourth grader pageant.
[101:42.78]That's got to be it, right?
[101:48.14]A+.
[101:48.24]Did I win?
[101:58.70]Well done, guys.
[101:59.82]Tough contest, but what a show.
[102:02.68]Only contestant, only winner.
[102:04.98]Let's hear it for our champion.
[102:07.34]What do you know?
[102:09.04]There he is.
[102:10.88]The only guy.
[102:13.44]Life is pain.
[102:15.00]I hate.
[102:21.25]Oh, we're A-list now.
[102:24.07]I mean, that's a two-time champion.
[102:26.86]First place and last place.
[102:28.32]Give it to A-List.
[102:30.52]There it is.
[102:30.90]Come on.
[102:32.14]A-List.
[102:35.18]5,000 points to unlock A-List.
[102:37.68]I don't care.
[102:38.26]I don't care about that.
[102:39.67]Really?
[102:41.55]Here comes the commercial.
[102:56.37]This show was sponsored by TV Superstars Magazine.
[103:00.93]Great paintball control.
[103:05.19]So, um, something interesting.
[103:07.31]Well, we'll talk about it in a minute.
[103:08.95]After this brilliant commercial for a product.
[103:12.99]Who knows what the product's gonna be.
[103:15.13]I don't know.
[103:19.50]Could be anything.
[103:25.48]Mm-hmm.
[103:33.00]Hurry up.
[103:34.75]We're all waiting.
[103:38.63]No commercial?
[103:40.41]What?
[103:42.49]Somebody gave a bunch of money too.
[103:46.97]Where's the commercial?
[103:47.75]Fuck!
[103:51.19]Why am I still in this game?
[103:54.76]Alright, there's a lot of bits that were given.
[103:57.28]I'm gonna have to go over them at the end of the stream.
[104:00.37]But 50 bucks from lamblam666.
[104:04.11]They just put a heart.
[104:04.82]Thank you for the $50, dude.
[104:07.64]We'll get to the rest of them after the stream is over.
[104:09.62]We're probably gonna end it pretty soon here.
[104:11.80]I need to get to A-list and then we'll get to the stream.
[104:13.50]So we're probably gonna be, probably gonna end it there.
[104:19.28]But thank you for the $50, dude.
[104:21.66]Lamblam666.
[104:25.24]Pretentious streamer cries because he's not featured in every commercial.
[104:32.44]Let's go to the magazine.
[104:33.22]We haven't even looked at this once.
[104:40.56]You guys gotta turn your ad block off so you can see the commercials.
[104:46.16]I'm B right now.
[104:47.30]Big Chili.
[104:48.44]Jeremiah is all the gossip.
[104:53.16]Okay.
[104:54.92]Frockstar.
[104:57.76]Best moment was on a commercial.
[104:59.52]My favorite show is commercials.
[105:01.71]My least favorite show is Let's Get Physical, even though I've won it twice.
[105:04.87]I don't have any celebrity partners.
[105:10.13]Paris Training, alright.
[105:11.67]We might have to go back to the... F1 3000.
[105:15.45]Look at these C-list celebrities get out of here.
[105:22.59]I'm so much better than you.
[105:28.93]God, I am just so much better.
[105:33.85]Can you understand?
[105:35.27]You can't even be in the same.
[105:36.47]Nobody can even be in the same room as me.
[105:38.40]You don't understand?
[105:40.42]And, not only do I have one Oscar, I got two.
[105:44.06]Two Oscars.
[105:45.60]And they're huge.
[105:47.36]For my performances.
[105:48.54]Biggest Oscars they've ever made in fucking the history of the MPAA.
[105:54.48]Chew on that one for a minute.
[106:01.50]Chew on that one.
[106:06.07]I think we've got a phone commercial, right?
[106:10.34]That beat list going to his head already.
[106:14.14]Look at me, Jeremiah.
[106:16.23]Jeremiah.
[106:16.45]Wait, we've got to get Emma out of here.
[106:18.31]SteffiF13000, you got it.
[106:29.40]Okay, we're shooting you.
[106:31.74]There's a robot attacking the city.
[106:33.88]Hold up.
[106:34.62]Okay, we're gonna do this one perfectly.
[106:36.30]Because now that I'm an A-list, you know, now that I'm just barely A-list, now I sell out and I do the commercial the way that, no more jokes.
[106:44.54]You know, fuck the jokes.
[106:46.04]It's all about the money now as an A-list celebrity.
[106:50.97]That's a creepy stance.
[106:53.35]Okay, you're in the park.
[106:54.65]Ignore the spaceship.
[106:56.99]It's a lovely day.
[106:58.72]The cell phone looks terrible.
[107:00.40]Now pocket it.
[107:01.72]Don't look behind you.
[107:03.84]Wrong.
[107:04.94]Robot attack.
[107:06.24]Back away.
[107:07.12]Back away.
[107:07.82]Good.
[107:08.14]Stun work.
[107:11.75]Look out.
[107:13.33]That was the robot's gigantic claw.
[107:16.53]You're dodging for your life.
[107:18.91]He's really close now.
[107:21.29]Dog can dodge.
[107:23.51]This is hard.
[107:24.09]This one's too hard.
[107:26.81]Okay.
[107:28.05]Now it's time to fight back.
[107:31.77]You're not letting that robot get away with this.
[107:35.74]Give me hot.
[107:39.30]Time to dial his number and bring him down.
[107:42.42]3029.
[107:42.50]I'm excited.
[107:43.28]I'm super excited.
[107:45.12]I actually was trying to press 3029.
[107:47.66]Fuck off.
[107:48.36]I was trying to make it press 3029.
[107:52.01]We'll get it this time.
[107:53.03]Okay, you're in the park.
[107:54.33]Ignore the spaceship.
[107:56.65]It's a lovely day.
[107:58.37]You're taking pictures.
[107:59.99]Now pocket it.
[108:01.39]Don't look behind you.
[108:04.59]Robot attack.
[108:05.89]Back away.
[108:06.77]Back away.
[108:07.47]Good.
[108:07.71]I fucking hate this game.
[108:10.05]Stun work.
[108:11.45]Look out.
[108:12.87]That props the robot's gigantic claw.
[108:16.14]You're dodging for your life.
[108:18.52]He's really close now.
[108:20.93]Duck and dodge.
[108:23.75]When you have to push things, the PlayStation move.
[108:26.29]Fucking bury this like E.T.
[108:27.67]Now it's time to fight back.
[108:31.33]This thing sucks, asshole.
[108:32.15]You're not letting that robot get away with this.
[108:34.83]The Wii came along and, like, Sony was like, oh, shit, we gotta do something like that to, like, the kids, to, like, let the fucking grandmothers and children like us.
[108:42.13]I'm excited.
[108:42.93]I'm super excited.
[108:44.79]They made this piece of garbage.
[108:48.89]Make it look frantic.
[108:53.15]I'm not dialing this number fast enough.
[108:55.55]I refuse to act.
[108:57.01]I refuse to act.
[108:57.75]You can't make me do it.
[109:20.93]It's five fucking thousand.
[109:27.27]It's fine.
[109:27.69]I don't care.
[109:31.34]I'm almost there.
[109:36.66]Even if you fail.
[109:37.38]Let's skip it.
[109:47.05]You tried.
[109:48.38]We gotta go take the other one back.
[109:52.06]I can't even beat a B-list.
[109:53.42]Well, it doesn't matter.
[109:54.74]That's not my style.
[109:57.10]That's not my style.
[110:00.26]I don't do cell phone commercials.
[110:02.22]You see how good my other commercials were for the toothpaste?
[110:05.22]Nobody can beat me in those.
[110:07.39]I'm so much more popular than all these people.
[110:09.67]Think I care about this guy with the Pegasus commercial with a shitty car?
[110:12.55]Have you seen my germ commercial?
[110:14.59]It's ten times better.
[110:17.27]Remember the deodorant commercial?
[110:18.97]I sold that.
[110:20.19]You know how many copies of the deodorant were sold?
[110:22.33]You know how many copies were sold?
[110:23.89]25,000.
[110:25.07]In one day.
[110:28.01]So, God, take your car that, like, 10 people bought.
[110:31.69]Break.
[110:33.07]I'm the important one here.
[110:40.48]We gotta take... We gotta go back and do the soccer one, right?
[110:45.48]I'm getting to A-list before the stream's over.
[110:51.26]I've got to pick an easier one, one that I can handle.
[110:55.08]25,000 a day is awful sales?
[110:56.36]No it is not!
[110:57.76]Which one?
[110:58.96]I need to sweep this.
[111:00.23]Okay, Foaming Thunder.
[111:01.25]I need to sweep this.
[111:05.11]I'm gonna fucking dead it.
[111:09.79]Sweep me!
[111:10.49]25,000 copies.
[111:18.64]We're gonna sweep all the shitty commercials of mine.
[111:20.52]Easy.
[111:20.84]No, it's not.
[111:49.50]Don't feed me a false narrative.
[111:50.90]This is not fun.
[111:52.60]They did it because they wanted to have cool cars.
[111:59.42]Now let's really work it.
[112:02.02]Go left.
[112:03.61]Straight up.
[112:05.09]This is jive.
[112:07.03]Get down.
[112:07.79]Almost there.
[112:08.61]And slide.
[112:11.53]Now the wheels.
[112:12.33]They make a shock.
[112:15.39]That's it.
[112:17.41]We're taking the shit for ourselves.
[112:18.45]I already won.
[112:20.81]We're good.
[112:21.53]Here comes the line.
[112:25.69]We're going to do this line correct.
[112:27.76]I'm not going to make a joke of this one.
[112:41.16]Nearly there.
[112:41.84]I'm an A-list celebrity, guys.
[112:43.72]I don't make jokes anymore.
[112:46.90]It's too crazy.
[112:48.74]I love it.
[112:49.82]There you go.
[112:54.13]Come here.
[112:54.45]Come here.
[112:54.67]Can we get the auto cue running?
[113:00.11]Try Thunder for a clean machine.
[113:02.09]Vroom, vroom.
[113:03.45]That's how you fucking nail it.
[113:05.51]Wow.
[113:07.70]That's how you nail a commercial.
[113:10.20]See, I ad-libbed a little bit there.
[113:13.44]I ad-libbed a little bit.
[113:14.98]You know, that's what they want to see as a director.
[113:22.43]That's what you want to see as a director, and that brought me to the A-list.
[113:26.53]A-list.
[113:30.67]And I got a meatball dinner for my troubles.
[113:33.15]Thank you.
[113:34.16]Darling, superb performance.
[113:37.03]That commercial is coming soon to a TV near you.
[113:40.03]Sure is.
[113:42.73]Life is pain.
[113:44.32]I hate... Sellout stream.
[113:50.16]There it is.
[113:55.82]A-list celebrity.
[113:56.30]That's it, everybody.
[113:57.92]I'm out of here.
[113:59.14]Some of us have awards to accept.
[114:01.40]Suki, red dress, please, for the red carpet.
[114:04.30]Ciao, you ordinary people.
[114:06.32]Here we go.
[114:11.10]This is what a real actor looks like.
[114:21.45]Try Thunder for a clean machine.
[114:23.01]Vroom, vroom!
[114:31.99]It's a little too close.
[114:44.53]This game is so dumb, but it's great.
[114:47.04]Like if you got like a little brother or a little sister that like makes this shit as fun.
[114:50.36]What a great game.
[114:51.20]They don't make these anymore.
[114:54.59]Is it because they all didn't make any money?
[114:57.31]Like, look, okay, the PlayStation Camera.
[114:59.55]I know, like, VR is, like, the big thing right now, but let's be real.
[115:04.60]How cool would it be if they made, like, a PlayStation 4 version of some of these games?
[115:07.64]These are classics.
[115:09.98]These are classics, and now I'm the best.
[115:12.13]So that's all.
[115:12.63]I beat the game.
[115:13.37]I win.
[115:17.14]Life is vroom.
[115:18.66]They're all on mobile now?
[115:19.98]Wow, you're cooking up a storm.
[115:22.20]You've unlocked another recipe in Big Beat Kitchen.
[115:28.43]Game sucks.
[115:30.95]Look, the game sucks.
[115:32.15]The game does suck.
[115:37.51]But that doesn't mean this can't be a fun experience for your little cousin.
[115:44.37]Right?
[115:46.58]A is for amazing.
[115:47.64]I beat the game.
[115:48.14]The game's over.

[121:03.57]It scrubs your scalp and it stimulates the nerves.
[121:08.73]Short guy uses big shampoo.
[121:10.63]No, that's just the name of the shampoo.
[121:13.29]I ain't going down this road with you guys again.
[121:14.93]That's a bumpy road.
[121:16.35]You're talking to an A-list celebrity.
[121:17.85]All right, I'm going to drop the A-list joke.
[121:19.79]Or am I?
[121:20.29]Probably never.
[121:20.71]No, I beat this game on stream.
[121:22.29]Add it to the list.
[121:24.00]LambBlam gave the $50 earlier.
[121:25.82]I know I thanked you already, but dude, that's a lot of money.
[121:29.22]Thank you, dude.
[121:30.20]Thank you so much for the 50 fucking bucks.
[121:32.86]5,000 bits.
[121:34.14]KingOfWales, three bucks.
[121:35.46]You're an A-plus streamer to everyone who watches you.
[121:37.56]Thank you.
[121:39.06]Thank you so much.
[121:41.39]You don't know if salt is good for your hair.
[121:43.86]Yes, it is.
[121:46.48]When it's, like, diluted.
[121:49.48]Don't start linking me evidence that, like, salt is bad for your hair.
[121:52.66]Because I'm going to look at it and I'm going to fucking have a frown on my face.
[121:54.98]And I'm going to be questioning my whole reality.
[121:57.40]So don't do that.
[121:59.90]But thank you so much, King of Whales.
[122:02.40]Also, Purple never turns purple.
[122:03.68]Gave 10 bucks a while back.
[122:05.92]Madman holds game show hosts hostage.
[122:08.89]Forces them to host shows only for him so he always wins every time.
[122:13.75]Pretty much.
[122:15.77]Dude, the life is paying for subs.
[122:18.63]Maybe.
[122:20.51]Don't put salt.
[122:21.91]Look, Lush is like a fucking Fortune 500 company.
[122:25.04]And they use all vegan ingredients.
[122:28.34]It's not true.
[122:29.22]Is it true?
[122:30.40]I don't know.
[122:30.68]I'm not even vegan.
[122:31.30]Who cares?
[122:31.68]I didn't tell you the conditioner that I use because I knew everyone was going to freak out.
[122:36.61]Listen, I'm not a vegan.
[122:38.73]The name of the conditioner that I use is called...
[122:44.46]It's called veganese.
[122:46.12]Fuck me.
[122:47.76]Okay, there you go.
[122:48.68]You got it.
[122:49.48]It's got lemon.
[122:51.06]It's got like fucking seaweed.
[122:56.00]That's why I use the seaweed conditioner, okay?
[123:01.66]I knew this was gonna happen.
[123:03.30]I was gonna say the word vegan.
[123:05.68]People are gonna lose their minds.
[123:08.68]Okay, what if the shampoo was called Meat Eater?
[123:11.64]Would you guys be freaking out?
[123:12.72]No.
[123:15.15]I eat plenty of meat.
[123:16.07]I had a fucking meatball sub like two days ago, and it was delicious.
[123:18.78]I'm not a vegan.
[123:21.66]But just because the name is stupid, it's not stupid.
[123:24.70]It's not stupid.
[123:26.50]I gotta backtrack here.
[123:27.20]Not stupid.
[123:28.34]If you want to be like a vegetarian or a vegan, that's you.
[123:30.22]Not me.
[123:30.60]That's you.
[123:31.74]Not stupid, but not me.
[123:33.08]It's you.
