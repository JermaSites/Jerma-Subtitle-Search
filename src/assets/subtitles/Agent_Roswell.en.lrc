[09:47.21]What about over here?
[09:49.95]Are they, like, invading?
[09:52.99]There's a shitload of them.
[10:00.13]What the?
[10:00.51]Okay.
[10:03.43]What the fuck is happening?
[10:08.99]Help!
[10:09.29]Somebody help me!
[10:16.43]I have no ammo left.
[10:17.75]What the fuck?
[10:27.34]What are they going to do?
[10:28.04]They're going to cut into me.
[10:46.50]Okay, what just happened?
[10:48.08]What did they do?
[10:48.66]What did they just do to me?
[10:52.28]They turned the contrast up.
[10:57.86]After first contact with the visitors in Roswell and the abduction of a military sergeant, a task force is created to deal with the possible threat of alien invaders.
[11:05.47]That task force is known as BAIT, the Bureau for Alien Investigation and Termination.
[11:11.21]As the son of the missing sergeant, you enroll to become an elite operative of the Bureau.
[11:16.24]After the Apollo moon landings in July 1969, UFO activity spikes as reports and sightings are flooding in of the visitors returning, clearly in great numbers and strength.
[11:27.15]Your job is to investigate these incidents and terminate anybody that's extraterrestrial.
[11:32.46]While the Bureau creates a long-term strategy to deal with them.
[11:35.28]You are Agent Roswell.
[11:38.18]Okay.
[11:41.72]Hello?
[11:41.84]Hello?
[11:44.59]Hello, Agent Roswell.
[11:46.13]I'm Secretary Francis.
[11:47.89]I hope your new office suits your needs.
[11:50.33]UFO activity is on the rise.
[11:52.39]You must investigate any reports you receive.
[11:55.35]Please look at these on your computer terminal.
[11:57.80]I'll be in touch.
[11:58.78]Good luck.
[12:01.00]Okay.
[12:03.10]My computer.
[12:04.12]Wait, what about the ballgame?
[12:08.04]Welcome to a... What?
[12:15.45]What the fuck?
[12:17.75]This is spoilers.
[12:19.40]No, exit.
[12:21.20]Exit, that's spoilers.
[12:21.92]I don't want to see those.
[12:28.78]Farm 1, City 1, Desert 1, Pine Valley.
[12:32.32]Side mission.
[12:32.96]Alright, let's do City 1.
[12:35.52]We've identified a group of radicals who call themselves CETA.
[12:39.19]Supporters of extraterrestrial arrivals.
[12:41.77]This group intends to contact or signal the aliens to land on Earth.
[12:45.61]They believe they will bring about a new world order free from governments and capitalism.
[12:49.63]They have been trying to rally support for their cause around the city.
[12:52.31]They've also stolen sensitive documents from another agent.
[12:55.97]Disband all CETA activity in the city and get back to the documents.
[13:00.68]Okay.
[13:05.62]It's a level creator?
[13:09.48]So these people are working with the aliens.
[13:18.21]Alright, I have a radar.
[13:22.34]Get in your car stored in the underground car park.
[13:34.69]Uh.
[13:35.71]I can kick.
[13:36.41]I can like fucking kick people.
[13:37.71]I don't wanna.
[13:39.85]Oh my god.
[13:40.31]Put that down.
[13:40.83]Put that down.
[13:41.47]Put that down.
[13:41.95]How do I put things away?
[13:42.67]How do I put weapons away?
[13:44.91]How do I put weapons away?
[13:46.60]How do you put a weapon away?
[13:48.48]I don't know.
[13:52.43]Can I just take any car?
[13:56.23]I can't just steal a car?
[13:57.31]Yeah, I can.
[13:58.35]What's wrong with this one?
[13:59.13]Are they police?
[14:06.74]I don't think that matters what car I take.
[14:10.18]I'm absolutely taking the motorcycle.
[14:11.36]There's no way I'm not taking this.
[14:13.84]Okay.
[14:14.74]Police.
[14:15.08]I need to...
[14:22.14]Stop, stop, stop it.
[14:26.53]I need that bike.

[14:28.15]I need the bike.
[14:28.67]I want the bike.
[14:44.77]Oh, shit.
[14:46.87]Oh, no.
[14:47.73]Okay.
[14:48.95]Can I get the motorcycle?
[14:52.13]Shit.
[14:53.43]Uh, I don't think- can I turn it around?
[14:54.75]I don't think I can get it to turn.
[15:03.48]Holy shit.
[15:04.54]Oh my god, that was awful.
[15:07.24]Where did she go?
[15:07.80]Fuck you.
[15:13.77]What?
[15:14.61]It just disappears?
[15:15.37]Alright, just give me- give me my car.
[15:23.47]That's a gunshot.
[15:25.77]Why am I kicking gunshots?
[15:33.09]Why is like 30 people screaming?
[15:39.64]Holy shit, what?
[15:41.34]Oh my god, that's so much blood.
[15:43.66]That was so much blood.
[15:45.76]There's not that much blood inside of somebody.
[15:48.98]Holy f- Oh my god.
[15:51.56]Okay.
[15:57.69]Can I eat?
[15:59.27]How much does food cost?
[16:00.39]How do I get under there?
[16:11.81]That like, stalk scream.
[16:15.33]How do I go underground?
[16:23.29]No, don't- Is there like a subway?
[16:35.48]How do I get underground?
[16:40.02]This bus cannot figure out what's going on because the thing's in the way.
[16:43.42]What are they doing?
[16:44.13]Why are they fighting?
[16:45.59]What is this guy doing?
[17:03.47]Hit the eject button.
[17:05.65]The guy ejected.
[17:10.79]I'm going to steal this because this guy has no idea what's going on.
[17:16.32]Alright, get out of the car.
[17:17.60]Get out of the car.
[17:18.96]That's enough.
[17:20.10]Get out.
[17:22.06]Get out of the car.
[17:22.70]Um, what?
[17:27.93]Where did you come from?
[17:28.85]You spawned as...
[17:34.00]What?
[17:51.74]Why is your car so much more armor?
[18:11.46]Alright, I'm playing the game.
[18:13.20]I hear a helicopter.
[18:16.18]Why is there a hel- Why is this game Grand Theft Auto?
[18:23.25]This just became a really just low-grade Grand Theft Auto.
[18:32.30]Okay, well, I'm just- I don't know where this thing is.
[18:34.54]I don't know how to get to the underground lair.
[18:36.96]I have no idea.
[18:40.23]What's- now he's- now there's a problem.
[18:50.65]Oh god.
[18:52.13]What is he doing?
[18:53.25]Okay.
[18:57.14]Where- I need to get this car.
[19:00.96]WHAT?!
[19:02.64]No!
[19:03.34]It's not in this game!
[19:04.86]It's impossible!
[19:06.48]It's literally impossible!
[19:08.64]It's impossible.
[19:09.32]Are you serious?
[19:10.42]You've got to be kidding me.
[19:17.93]This is the same person?
[19:25.91]I don't know.
[19:27.81]Why did you put this in here?
[19:34.78]I can't fucking believe it.
[19:36.06]I am shocked right now.
[19:38.91]It's something that felt real familiar, I'll be honest.
[19:44.01]I want the bike.
[19:44.53]I want the bike.
[19:53.78]Is that actually in the game?
[19:54.92]Yeah, it is.
[19:55.86]What is that guy just... Why is that guy floating around?
[19:57.56]You cannot ride bikes.
[20:13.27]It's down there.
[20:13.87]Okay.
[20:18.16]If you guys don't know why, I just freaked out.
[20:20.60]That's in Grab That Auto 5.
[20:23.60]It's an old video I made.
[20:25.10]We played a bunch of shitty GTA clones.
[20:27.46]And that song appeared in like four or five of them in a row.
[20:33.69]Oh, that's shocking to see that.
[20:42.64]I've seen what happens.
[20:43.14]Alright, so where's my car?
[20:51.01]Yeah, like five years ago.
[20:52.71]Alright, what the fuck?
[20:58.03]I can't fucking believe it.
[21:03.26]What does it want me to do?
[21:06.34]Get in your car in the underground car park.
[21:08.78]Where is my car?
[21:14.95]Oh, it's- is that it?
[21:15.65]Yeah, I did not just put a- that's not my car.
[21:37.41]Oh, destroy three protest rally trucks.
[21:58.38]So these are the people that want the aliens to take over.
[22:01.72]Is that what I'm understanding?
[22:06.02]My fucking right ear hurts.
[22:08.24]Ow.
[22:09.61]Ow.
[22:11.95]What the fuck?
[22:13.13]Wait, why do I have this?
[22:16.05]Oh my god.
[22:24.38]Why is all of a sudden it's a James Bond car?
[22:36.76]What is it saying?
[22:39.48]Abduct me.
[22:41.96]Aliens, come in peace.
[22:43.40]Abduct me.
[22:51.75]No, I put- I don't want this- I don't want to put that out.
[22:54.45]I want to read the signs.
[22:57.09]What does it say?
[23:01.46]Extraterrestrials are here.
[23:04.16]Welcome to Earth.
[23:10.54]I love UFOs.
[23:12.11]I mean, they're not doing anything wrong.
[23:14.23]Like, what's illegal about this?
[23:18.87]The aliens are attacking.
[23:27.88]Beam me up.
[23:32.60]How do I do?
[23:32.98]I have to destroy these?
[23:35.42]Where's my car?
[23:45.09]Beam me up.
[23:47.07]What are you looking at?
[23:53.49]Things were different in the 50s.
[23:59.05]Do I need to knock out their truck?
[24:02.81]Did I do it?
[24:11.86]Abduct me now.
[24:12.64]I mean, look, if somebody wanted the aliens to abduct him, I can't tell you not to do that.
[24:19.21]Do they want to take over Earth?
[24:31.26]You have the- Oh yeah, right.
[24:44.67]Uh... Did that do anything?
[24:56.23]Okay, I think I did it.
[25:00.96]Alright, watch out.
[25:01.48]Get out of the way.
[25:02.25]I mean, do we know the motive?
[25:13.91]The briefing that we got said that they want the aliens to take over.
[25:16.80]And they want to, like, kill everybody and abduct everybody.
[25:20.12]That's what we're understanding?
[25:30.36]Little green men are cool.
[25:34.99]This is like people ju- This is- I don't see anything going on that's wrong.
[25:58.98]I want to watch out.
[26:05.08]Little sus men.
[26:09.23]Put the cars in the ocean?
[26:10.35]Yeah.
[26:23.69]You're supposed to be wrong.
[26:25.19]That's what's wrong.
[26:29.12]Move, move, move out of the way.
[26:33.80]Oh, boy.
[26:37.10]This would be a great time for you to move out of the way.
[26:41.25]Move out of the way.
[26:42.17]Good.
[26:42.57]Alright.
[26:44.43]You're going to soft walk yourself?
[26:46.85]I don't think I am.
[26:48.45]This is going right into the ocean.
[26:55.94]It's stuck?
[26:56.50]Okay, I think I have to... I have to ditch both cars.
[27:01.85]Oh, fuck.
[27:02.37]Hold on.
[27:11.59]Is there an invisible wall?
[27:13.90]Oh, alright.
[27:28.57]What happened to this person?
[27:30.85]Watch out!
[27:41.69]Why are there just people lying on the ground, like, ran over?
[28:00.01]Why am I driving the taxi?
[28:01.39]I don't know.
[28:01.75]Because it was available.
[28:03.25]Okay.
[28:19.28]Move this out of the way.
[28:28.40]What?
[28:28.64]Did I?
[28:29.12]Did I?
[28:29.76]Is that the mission complete music?
[28:34.08]I can't tell.
[28:34.70]No, no.
[28:37.84]Okay, it's regular music.
[28:39.22]Okay.
[28:46.26]I have to destroy it.
[28:50.12]I want to get some more info here.
[28:59.06]Oh my god.
[28:59.80]Alright, I'm good.
[29:04.68]Shut down the illegal pirate radio broadcasters attempting to signal the aliens.
[29:17.19]People are just trying to signal the aliens?
[29:19.23]Have the aliens attacked yet?
[29:24.95]I need to understand more of what's going on.
[29:28.03]Have the aliens attacked yet?
[29:29.33]They have?
[29:32.35]At the start of the game.
[29:32.93]Did they attack like a city?
[29:36.39]They literally killed your father.
[29:38.51]Oh, okay.
[29:49.02]What the fuck was that?
[29:50.70]Hey!
[29:53.32]Who's shooting at me?
[29:59.19]Oh wait, that- What the fuck?
[30:11.95]This is the radio tower.
[30:13.39]So they're trying to signal the aliens.
[30:19.72]My fucking head.
[30:20.92]That was so loud.
[30:28.61]Is it fall damage?
[30:30.65]Yep.
[30:33.37]Watch out.
[30:44.26]I swear to god you walk faster than driving.
[30:50.19]I kind of want a skateboard or something too though.
[30:58.16]I did not want to do that.
[30:59.34]Can I not take the skateboard?
[31:10.43]So where are the aliens now?
[31:19.87]Alright, get up here.
[31:32.15]Are they going to shoot me?
[31:36.18]Yep.
[31:36.28]He's trying to shoot me.
[31:55.36]How do you dodge, Roel?
[31:56.68]Oh, that's how you dodge.
[31:57.32]Okay.
[32:03.80]I shot him in the fucking head!
[32:05.02]I... So it's like... Is there anybody up here?
[32:24.91]I don't even know how to react to this game.
[32:34.52]Uh-oh.
[32:35.10]Ultimate fall joke incoming.
[32:36.56]I saw it.
[32:37.12]I saw it.
[32:37.82]Do you think I'll die?
[32:38.38]What do you think?
[32:41.11]Is this a fall that will kill me?
[32:49.67]Nope.
[32:53.51]Okay, we're fine.
[32:54.12]Alright, there's a guy on the roof, though.
[33:01.50]I have to be aware.
[33:04.73]And if he shoots me once, I'm dead.
[33:11.23]This thing is giving me, like, anxiety.
[33:13.59]I don't like how close it's getting.
[33:14.77]I don't like how weird it's acting.
[33:15.91]Alright.
[33:20.21]Can I aggro?
[33:20.69]God damn it.
[33:27.00]He's gonna shoot me once and I'm gonna die.
[33:36.22]You're up even higher.
[33:37.12]Wait.
[33:40.62]Where are you?
[33:40.98]Are you just sitting right there?
[33:41.74]Okay.
[33:55.81]I did it.
[33:58.25]You've regen health over time.
[33:59.43]Don't stand too close to this.
[34:00.27]It's going to explode and kill me.
[34:02.41]Alright.
[34:02.75]I'm on the rooftops.
[34:04.85]The aliens don't have any more broadcasting equipment.
[34:07.77]I stole secret files from Bait.
[34:09.32]Retrieve them.
[34:10.42]There's an activity in the industrial district.
[34:12.82]Check the garages and roofs.
[34:16.38]Where are the aliens?
[34:28.26]You're the alien.
[34:29.72]Where are they?
[34:37.74]That's heavy bass.
[34:40.04]I like the heavy bass.
[34:53.25]What else you got?
[34:58.77]Alright.
[35:00.23]I like it.
[35:14.28]This feels very iPad gamey.
[35:19.99]No, this is not porn music.
[35:22.43]This is... Watch out.
[35:33.01]To me, this is first name, last name.
[35:35.21]Dev on App Store.
[35:41.25]It's not, you know, not like, oh, like, uh... Firestuff Studios!
[35:45.11]Nope.
[35:50.59]This is first name, last name dev on the App Store.
[35:54.03]Alright, so I have to stop them from... Alright, let's stop them.
[36:02.86]Alright, there's one.
[36:03.74]How many people?
[36:04.16]Do I have to get... This is not good.
[36:09.70]Wait, recover.
[36:21.63]Um... You're under arrest!
[36:28.24]Can I land on him?
[36:31.14]Please do.
[36:31.68]I got him.
[36:47.14]Oh, it hurts.
[36:47.90]Alright, hold on.
[36:50.05]What's the goal?
[36:51.61]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[36:53.67]I gotta get the boxes full of files.
[37:04.69]Files in here.
[37:08.75]What?
[37:19.70]Okay.
[37:20.16]Got it.
[37:20.40]What else?
[37:22.05]There's files.
[37:24.33]What was even in here?
[37:24.97]Is that gonna explode?
[37:31.27]Of course it is.
[37:31.97]Okay.
[37:33.97]No files?
[37:34.55]Where are these files?
[37:46.20]There's nothing even in here.
[37:49.61]Check the garages and the roofs.
[37:52.67]Dude.
[37:55.11]This is literally Saints Row.
[37:56.81]I should literally play Saints Row on stream.
[37:59.96]Don't you think?
[38:03.04]I should literally play Saints Row.
[38:08.95]Any of these other ones open?
[38:17.07]Only like first two.
[38:19.33]Yeah, I play like Saints Row 2.
[38:20.45]I'm out of bullets.
[38:29.12]Okay, we're fine.
[38:29.68]Give me that gun.
[38:31.16]Give me that gun!
[38:47.75]There's a shitload of people up there.
[38:48.93]Give me that gun.
[39:04.26]Can I not pick it up?
[39:12.32]Please fall off so I don't have to... I gotta get up there.
[39:19.04]I don't even know how many files I have to find.
[39:22.66]Oh, shit, there we go.
[39:25.28]Okay, how many more?
[39:25.90]Recovered a box.
[39:27.24]I think there's one or two more, maybe?
[39:29.20]Play two, three, and four.
[39:31.68]I at least want to do two and three.
[39:36.19]Absolutely, without doubt.
[39:53.87]How was I supposed to do that?
[39:57.31]How was I ever supposed to do that?
[39:59.01]Are you serious?
[39:59.59]I don't even... No missions yet?
[40:16.64]Oh, fuck off.
[40:17.48]Really?
[40:17.78]Oh, what?
[40:26.29]I want to see the aliens.
[40:27.55]Alright, no fucking around.
[40:32.76]I'm doing this quick.
[40:33.40]I want to see aliens.
[40:34.12]Yeah, no more fucking around.
[40:35.31]We're keeping this on.
[40:37.73]I'm trying to not take one point of damage.
[41:00.44]I can't believe this is gonna be... That guy just fucked everything up.
[41:21.16]He's got tire marks all over his butt, okay.
[41:31.95]Can't fire?
[41:33.35]Can't shoot.
[41:33.72]I thought the car had guns.
[41:38.34]Did I...
[42:01.30]Okay, I'm stuck under here.
[42:07.67]Get the fuck out of here!
[42:08.77]I think he crushed his head.
[42:12.57]Jesus.
[42:14.91]Why do I have a sniper?
[42:18.73]Where did I get a sniper rifle from?
[42:20.32]How are you still alive?
[42:27.32]I don't understand.
[42:49.99]Okay.
[42:51.83]Somebody said this game sucks.
[42:55.11]Don't, we can't review the game until we get to see the aliens.
[42:57.77]Don't you, I can't review it until we see aliens on the screen.
[43:04.41]Hold off your judgments.
[43:05.65]Hold them now.
[43:10.43]Oh, come on.
[43:23.84]This weapon sucks absolute fucking ass.
[43:26.06]Are you kidding me?
[43:30.13]What just happened?
[43:31.69]Somebody's car exploded.
[43:38.77]What?
[43:40.55]What is this head lean?
[43:42.33]I shot him right in the head.
[43:43.39]Throw a grenade?
[43:48.53]I don't have any grenades.
[43:56.62]Fuck you!
[43:57.72]God damn it!
[44:00.06]He's gonna kill me.
[44:00.72]He's gonna kill me.
[44:01.25]It's over.
[44:10.07]This sucks!
[44:15.92]What the fuck?
[44:18.38]How?
[44:18.94]He's inside of the thing!
[44:20.88]He's inside?
[44:33.31]Jeremiah, I don't think there's gonna be aliens.
[44:34.43]There's gonna be aliens!
[44:35.23]You have to wait.
[44:35.61]I have a sniper rifle.
[44:42.61]I'm just gonna snipe from, like, another building.
[44:45.83]Yeah.
[44:46.65]I'm just sniping from another building.
[44:49.15]I'm climbing up and I'm gonna snipe.
[44:59.80]Did you pay for this?
[45:00.66]I- Yes, I did.
[45:05.22]I think it's... I think it could be fun.
[45:07.87]We have to get out of this segment.
[45:10.75]Trust me.
[45:11.15]You gotta trust.
[45:13.51]It's hard... Okay, this is really hard to drive.
[45:15.61]It just skids around all over the place.
[45:17.03]Why?
[45:17.29]Is the handbrake on?
[45:18.15]I would not be driving it like this.
[45:34.27]Okay, I gotta climb up somewhere.
[45:35.71]I want a good view.
[45:38.29]Let's get off.
[45:55.44]There's only one guy up here.
[46:26.22]I shot him in the head!
[46:30.83]I shot him in his head!
[46:34.57]In his head!
[46:55.65]Oh my god.
[46:56.21]Give me the sniper.
[47:10.18]Sniper!
[47:11.76]Give me the fucking sniper rifle!
[47:13.57]Which one is it?
[47:43.79]Give me this weapon.
[47:49.64]Okay, shooting people in the head doesn't matter.
[48:04.28]Okay, good.
[48:11.40]Now, are there plans up here?
[48:12.54]I need to see the aliens in the city.
[48:14.11]I'm sorry, guys.
[48:14.75]This is how it works.
[48:21.89]Okay.
[48:23.67]There we go.
[48:25.47]Plans.
[48:27.57]Plans.
[48:30.58]There are three or four- There's a lot more plans.
[48:33.46]Holy shit, this sucks.
[48:35.74]Alright, what about the other buildings?
[48:40.50]There's two plans in this building.
[48:41.84]There's aliens in the room with you right now.
[48:47.87]They were.
[48:48.49]You just saw me get, like, shocked or whatever.
[48:50.57]Electrocuted.
[49:10.83]I did mocap for this game.
[49:12.21]Did you really?
[49:20.42]Oh, nice.
[49:21.20]You did the mocap?
[49:27.04]I have to see an alien.
[49:27.86]I'm sorry.
[49:28.16]That's the way it is.
[49:49.21]Real mocap actor?
[49:51.09]That's pretty sick dude.
[49:55.57]What was it like?
[49:59.70]Is it cool?
[50:09.60]Where the fuck is this thing?
[50:11.94]It has to be one more.
[50:13.17]Where?
[50:23.90]It's in one of these random buildings.
[50:25.10]Come on.
[50:30.02]Over here?
[50:30.44]Over here.
[50:33.48]Okay.

[50:57.77]Alright, nice.
[51:07.63]Awesome.
[51:10.07]Okay, City 2.
[51:12.09]We believe that the aliens have the ability to hide in plain sight.
[51:15.06]Use the detector to identify any aliens disguised as pedestrians.
[51:19.22]We report they're at three locations marked on your radar.
[51:23.18]Exterminate any you uncover immediately.
[51:33.93]I've had more fun watching your paint walls and House Flipper Once I see the aliens I don't worry Hey people, thanks for the five community subs alright, so this is my get to the location so this this determines if somebody's an alien I

[52:02.94]This does not seem to hurt.
[52:04.14]30-90 Omega Lull.
[52:12.77]Are you really telling me 30-90 Omega Lull in a game like this?
[52:23.32]Here comes day Dallas levels of subordination.
[52:26.20]I don't think so.
[52:28.92]Not even close.
[52:33.22]Alright.
[52:36.39]Somebody over here is an alien.
[52:56.13]Do I want other people to know?
[52:57.19]Which one is an alien?
[53:28.63]There's more?
[53:32.05]How are there more aliens?
[53:44.98]Do I go somewhere else?
[53:47.10]What is what?
[53:47.46]What is that?
[53:54.32]Oh shit!
[53:58.90]Wait, is it like a false alarm or does it actually do it?
[54:16.31]Next location, okay.
[54:19.27]We've seen the aliens now.
[54:22.08]Now I need to check everybody.
[54:23.78]Oh shit!
[54:58.14]You're ready to stay calm.
[55:03.64]Alright, you're all clean.
[55:08.59]He doesn't have another game prepared, Omega Lull.
[55:11.03]Dang!
[55:12.15]You know, you're... You've got a great eye.
[55:16.90]You've got a great eye.
[55:17.80]You should... Yeah.
[55:18.98]You should, uh...
[55:22.35]He doesn't have anything else planned for today.
[55:24.93]Uh, well, not technically, no.
[55:26.70]He didn't have anything else.
[55:27.48]Nope.
[55:32.72]This is the plan.
[55:36.80]Although, there are other... Actually, there are other options.
[55:39.90]What?
[55:40.56]I want to play it tomorrow.
[55:41.52]I don't want to do the game I'm supposed to play tomorrow, today.
[55:46.68]You guys aliens?
[56:00.63]Nobody.
[56:00.93]Okay.
[56:05.03]Let me see what else I got.
[56:05.85]Okay.
[56:07.34]I want to see one more area and then fine.
[56:09.00]I want to see one more zone and then I'll be fine.
[56:15.48]Jump King DLC?
[56:16.50]No.
[56:16.88]Not at a chance in hell.
[56:17.76]Not in a million years.
[56:18.66]Nope.
[56:31.71]Pawn Shop?
[56:32.21]Yeah, the Pawn Shop game is tomorrow and I feel like that's an entire stream.
[56:38.83]What we're looking for right now is a way to potentially have another maybe like hour and a half.
[56:46.84]I'm running people over.
[56:49.14]Alright, it's down there.
[56:55.48]What?
[56:59.43]What?
[57:03.61]Where is it?
[57:08.46]Deltarune?
[57:09.08]I don't want to play Deltarune.
[57:11.50]It's been so long since Chapter 1 that I have to play Chapter 1 before I do Chapter 2 again.
[57:16.62]So we're going to do that next weekend.
[57:19.35]I forget everything.
[57:23.53]I don't want to jump into Chapter 2 without... I literally couldn't even tell you who the main character's name is.
[57:28.43]I couldn't tell you.
[57:28.95]There's like three or four characters.
[57:30.01]I have no idea what their names are.
[57:37.86]What the fuck is... How do I get down there?
[57:42.06]Alien.
[57:42.72]Is that not an alien?
[57:58.83]That was an alien, though.
[58:00.05]Alright, well.
[58:01.98]How do I get down?
[58:02.68]Wait, what's this staring at me?
[58:15.88]And destroy.
[58:16.70]And destroy all humans.
[58:19.92]Not this time.
[58:21.72]I have no idea where the fuck I'm supposed to go.
[58:24.29]He's not dead.
[58:30.89]Apparently underground or down under somewhere.
[58:33.74]I don't get it.
[58:36.18]I pick Ross.
[58:38.18]We'll see what I have.
[58:47.02]Alright, we'll switch games.
[58:48.36]Don't worry.
[58:49.90]Everybody relax.
[58:50.86]I just wanted to see the aliens.
[58:52.84]Everybody relax.
[59:07.46]I don't know how to get... Okay.
[59:16.24]What about this farm and desert?
[59:18.50]Desert one.
[59:19.04]Alright, desert.
[59:20.76]I just want to see the desert one.
[59:26.87]Play The Long Drive?
[59:27.83]No, I don't think so.
[59:36.36]Check out the junkyard.
[59:37.32]Oh, this is actually kind of cool.
[59:54.26]Next game is just this game.
[59:56.04]No, we'll play something else for like an hour.
[60:06.39]I have to see if it's possible.
[60:08.03]Every game of the gas station, you need to know.
[60:09.37]It works.
[60:20.24]I can't move.
[60:25.19]Alright, let me see what I... Hold on.
[60:26.39]Can I fly?
[60:26.77]If you can fly a plane, give me a break, right?
[60:28.77]Just hold on.
[60:40.80]Really?
[60:41.10]Come on.
[60:42.86]Come on.
[60:45.34]Alright, fine, fine.
[60:46.70]It was cool.
[60:47.34]I liked it.
[60:48.32]I liked it.
[60:48.85]But I think we saw what we wanted to see, and I'm gonna move on.
[60:55.66]What do we got?
[61:00.32]-2 letter grade?
[61:01.06]No!
[61:01.32]What are you talking about?
[61:02.06]That's not fair.
[61:08.58]That's not fair.
[61:13.37]Alright, we got... Oh, shit!
[61:19.33]I have that stupid... Well, not stupid.
[61:22.65]No, I have this, too.
[61:25.11]I got this too.
[61:25.69]Alright.
[61:27.15]By a show of hands, I downloaded this game the other day.
[61:33.75]It's called Animal Ultimate Simulator Battle.
[61:37.51]What's it called?
[61:39.27]Animal Revolt Battle Sim.
[61:40.69]It looked like it was kind of insane.
[61:51.26]Is it a YouTuber game?
[61:55.66]It's a YouTuber game.
[61:57.16]It's a YouTuber bait.
[62:00.70]Let's try it.
[62:01.48]Whatever.
[62:01.78]I'm not playing the game.
[62:03.48]I'm not playing Pawn Shop.
[62:05.16]I want to play that tomorrow.
[62:08.54]Get the chopsticks.
[62:09.28]I'll get the chopsticks in a minute.
[62:10.90]Before the stream ends, I promise.
[62:11.80]Alright, give me a second.
[62:13.50]Let me open this game up.
[62:15.68]See if this is like a funny game or not.
