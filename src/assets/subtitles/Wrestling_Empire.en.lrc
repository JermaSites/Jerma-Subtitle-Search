[01:00.24]Hello.
[01:00.50]How you doing?
[01:05.70]Welcome to another edition.
[01:08.46]Of streaming with Jeremy.
[01:11.90]Right, people don't know the real spelling of my name.
[01:13.82]It's Jeremy.
[01:17.89]A E R I M Hello, yeah, I'm not on the toilet.
[01:26.36]Uh, sorry.
[01:26.82]I feel like I can't reach out my stream now.
[01:29.98]I have like an opening with an apology video.
[01:33.90]Hey, sorry, buddy.
[01:34.90]Sorry that like the stream's like three hours late.
[01:36.66]Uh, sorry that the stream's like two days late.
[01:38.29]Hey, sorry.
[01:38.85]Guys, sorry about this.
[01:41.03]Um.
[01:42.49]But, yeah, that, I'm gonna, let's go over this.
[01:45.01]Because people, I don't want anyone to be concerned.
[01:46.99]I don't want anyone to be annoyed.
[01:48.11]Uh, although, I can't really control that 100%, but I'm gonna, let's just let, here we go.
[01:53.88]Uh, I kind of fucked myself up the last few days.
[01:57.56]I'm doing some new stretches and some new yoga moves.
[02:01.74]Help with the chest and spine pain.
[02:05.54]And, um, I kind of got locked up in the middle of one.
[02:10.92]And I kind of fucked myself up.
[02:14.59]Well, that was fun.
[02:18.87]Can you fart?
[02:19.49]I mean, my body is physically capable of doing it, but I'm not going to do it for you.
[02:34.22]All the exercise is killing you.
[02:37.02]No, there's so many theories as to why or what I did.
[02:40.54]I don't know.
[02:43.55]But, my back and shoulder area, kind of in the middle of my back, straight through where the rib cage is, on the right side, I think I pulled something or pinched something trying to do some of these yoga moves.
[03:00.52]That's just funny on its own.
[03:02.04]I'm the old fat guy.
[03:05.10]That does the yoga shit and, like, goes to the hospital, like, hurts himself.
[03:10.07]Of course.
[03:10.45]I didn't go to the hospital, like, to make that really clear.
[03:14.23]Um.
[03:17.21]But, yeah, I'm trying to do it.
[03:18.37]I'm trying to move some of the muscle and the tissue around in this area.
[03:23.48]Again, if you don't know, I'll say it again.
[03:26.10]I have a three-year going on chronic pain problem that I'm still trying to figure out exactly why it's happening.
[03:35.96]And yada, yada, yada.
[03:38.14]X, Y, Z. Okay.
[03:40.98]Let's go.
[03:41.46]Let's stream.
[03:42.08]Here we are.
[03:46.02]You were practicing the sit and reach.
[03:52.82]I still don't... I get it, but I still don't get it.
[03:56.16]If that makes any sense.
[03:57.00]Anyways, today we're going to play a game that I've wanted to play for a very long time.
[04:01.54]And weirdly enough, the guy that made this game remade it this year.
[04:06.80]And it came out like seven days ago.
[04:08.36]Those of you who know the MDickey games, I've always heard about them, but I've never played them.
[04:15.69]There's been a lot of requests to play Wrestling Revolution 3D.
[04:20.82]And I took a look at the trailer.
[04:22.12]I've looked at a little bit of shit about it.
[04:23.80]Don't want to get too into it.
[04:25.94]It looked insane.
[04:28.31]But he remade it.
[04:30.29]This is Wrestling Empire.
[04:33.59]I guess he remastered it.
[04:35.37]So I was like, oh fuck, well I'll just wait for that one.
[04:39.24]And here it is.
[04:42.56]So I don't know about character customization.
[04:44.61]I don't know if we can make a character, but in the last day or two, just kind of poking around, I've edited a few people.
[04:53.51]So I think we're going to pick a character that we want to be and edit that character and play as that character in career mode.
[05:10.79]This game is fucking rad.
[05:12.44]I've heard about it, but I have never experienced it, so we're going to experience it together.
[05:21.42]And it's weird because I looked at the control scheme of this game.
[05:24.54]I opened the tutorial.
[05:26.50]I just looked at it.
[05:27.96]And kind of walked around a little bit.
[05:29.30]And I'm just like, holy shit, this is...
[05:31.96]This is like No Mercy.
[05:33.22]This reminds me of the old N64 games.
[05:36.02]With the grapple.
[05:37.40]And then you're in a grapple and you hit up attack, down attack, left attack.
[05:42.23]This feels very No Mercy to me.
[05:44.91]And if this is the closest thing that I can get to No Mercy, then this is going to be one of my favorite games.
[06:02.39]important is your surgery before the big stream well I don't sorry that's why I was like quiet I was like silent just reading
[06:13.12]Oh, I fucking back anyways.
[06:15.28]Um, no, I don't have a surgery on schedule yet.
[06:20.92]That's something that I haven't, I have another doctor's appointment in a week and we're going to go over the timeframe of when that will happen because there is a lot of major projects going on that I don't like that.
[06:32.82]I'm not going to just cancel.
[06:38.51]stream it no but anyways let's go I'm ready I hope this is not dmca tell me immediately if it is we're gonna find out right now is this dmca claimable yes it is so I'm gonna try to find a way to uh I'm pretty sure this is like a song alright we're gonna make a character we're gonna do career mode I'm not gonna tell you guys very much about this because I don't know much about it either
[07:09.89]Let's go over here.
[07:12.55]So this is M. Dicky's Wrestling Revolution.
[07:16.69]And there's a lot of unlockable characters.
[07:21.81]Is this okay?
[07:22.89]I'll go.
[07:23.37]I'll be fine.
[07:24.95]Alright.
[07:26.55]So where am I?
[07:27.15]Who should I pick?
[07:27.73]Alright.
[07:27.93]I made this guy.
[07:28.60]I made Craft Ben.
[07:30.94]I made Schmoke.
[07:33.38]Who else did I make?
[07:34.56]I made like one or two people just messing around in the crater.
[07:42.21]What does the... Okay, so there's green, there's pink, and then there's purple pink.
[07:50.98]What do the different colors mean?
[07:55.38]Looks like pink is women.
[07:58.50]What is the purple?
[08:03.91]Oh, it's heel and face.
[08:05.81]Oh, shit.
[08:06.31]Okay.
[08:06.73]Well, what do we want to play as?
[08:16.31]I don't want to play as Schmoke.
[08:19.17]I just made this guy in like 10 minutes for fun.
[08:21.10]Did I play as Schmoke?
[08:30.03]But I wanted to make a character on stream.
[08:32.75]I don't want to just play as this guy.
[08:34.07]For my career.
[08:43.63]Alright, well we have to make him less popular because that's too popular.
[08:46.13]He has to have a fucking C- in every ability.
[08:53.13]EMCA?
[08:53.73]Whatever.
[08:54.27]I- look.
[08:59.80]What about attitude?
[09:00.44]Should I put that somewhere?
[09:05.88]No, we're making our own character.
[09:06.98]No, no, no.
[09:08.28]We'll have plenty of interactions with Schmoke over the next two days, okay?
[09:14.29]Oh, should I?
[09:14.93]Okay.
[09:16.23]I want to be a... I want to be a heel.
[09:21.12]How about heckle horn?
[09:22.34]I'm just going to recreate them anyways.
[09:27.96]Heel or face?
[09:28.70]Which one?
[09:31.70]I think I want to be a heel.
[09:42.05]Alright, I'm gonna be healed.
[09:43.51]Let's edit Hecklehorn.
[09:44.71]Okay, we're gonna change that name.
[09:50.03]Let's go with the theme music.
[09:51.57]What do we got?
[09:56.14]There'll be wicked fast cartoon clown sounds.
[10:01.22]I kind of like that.
[10:07.68]Enus music?
[10:12.18]You can slow it down too, though.
[10:13.20]Hold on.
[10:22.39]That's pretty... I like that too.
[10:24.13]Yeah, this like... God, this like sucks.
[10:29.39]At like 80%.
[10:29.67]Actually, it doesn't... What do I mean suck?
[10:33.37]This sounds awesome.
[10:39.29]It sounds like I'm underwater.
[10:44.52]Yeah, I'm keeping that one.
[10:46.14]The name's gotta change, but alright.
[10:47.22]Pyro.
[10:47.74]Fireworks, fountains, smoke, or full works?
[10:51.04]Alright, we're doing full fireworks.
[10:53.24]Do I come in with a prop?
[10:54.88]Microphone, camera, bell, explosive!
[11:00.87]Explosive!
[11:03.63]Baseball bat, chair...
[11:13.48]Come in with a grenade.
[11:16.05]What the fuck?
[11:17.13]Alright, how about baseball bat?
[11:18.57]Alright, let me ask you guys.
[11:20.63]How popular do you think I am?
[11:23.31]No, I'm not just talking about twitch.tv.
[11:24.63]I'm talking about everywhere.
[11:25.85]60% popular?
[11:29.46]70% popular?
[11:30.08]40% popular?
[11:30.86]How popular do you think I am?
[11:37.20]No, no, no.
[11:37.54]Household name is at least 95%.
[11:38.70]No way.
[11:44.12]And if you really think about it, outside of the Twitch sphere of content creators and community members, it's probably like this in the grand scheme of things.
[12:05.10]But you're the sus guy.
[12:06.36]Alright, you know what, that bumps you up at least a few points.
[12:10.21]Let's do 65%.
[12:12.75]How does that sound?
[12:14.45]Strength is pretty bad, but no, I don't want to be like a piece of shit.
[12:17.21]I wouldn't really actually play the game.
[12:20.83]My mom knows you exist.
[12:23.53]That's because it's your mother, and you probably talk about me at dinner.
[12:28.05]You probably like do the sus face at dinner with like fucking green beans in your mouth, and your mother's probably sick of it.
[12:40.72]67% strength.
[12:43.76]68% strength.
[12:48.07]30% skill.
[12:49.53]I think I am kind of skilled in a way.
[12:51.79]Nah, we'll do 70.
[12:55.89]It's gonna- oh no, hold on.
[12:58.33]I don't wanna be- it's gonna be hard if I don't do this.
[13:03.38]My dad watched your spore stream and thought you were stupid.
[13:11.71]Whatever.
[13:12.03]Your dad had one small example of my stream.
[13:16.05]I'm going to put skill up to like 78 and agility down.
[13:22.55]And the stamina is going way down.
[13:24.19]But no, it's going to stay at 65.
[13:25.49]That looks good.
[13:29.56]My attitude is very good.
[13:32.22]I'd say it's 80%.
[13:32.64]I have a very good attitude.
[13:35.04]I do.
[13:35.28]82%. 80%.
[13:42.00]Okay, now we have to... I gotta get off this song.
[13:44.98]Alright, build.
[13:48.08]Yep, okay.
[13:49.16]26, that's... How old can you go?
[13:52.44]You can go to 100?
[13:56.26]Who would be wrestling at 100?
[13:57.20]Alright, we're gonna just do me.
[14:01.49]Okay.
[14:02.77]Whatever.
[14:13.75]4, 6, 2, 7, 10!
[14:14.95]4, 6?
[14:15.35]No, we're gonna be- I'm doing me.
[14:30.66]That's so skinny, that's how much I actually weigh though.
[14:32.64]Alright, can I like beef it up just for the fiction?
[14:43.53]Why is there a 5.8 emote?
[14:45.03]Whose emote is that?
[14:45.89]Why do they have that?
[14:51.77]Muscle mass.
[14:52.57]It used to be alright.
[14:55.41]Even though over the years I've dropped a lot of the muscle from when I was working out.
[15:02.54]Medical bullshit.
[15:03.88]I still got pretty big ass arms and I'm not just saying that.
[15:09.14]My arms are pretty fucking large, and you've seen them and you know.
[15:12.38]That's never going away.
[15:13.70]I think that's fair.
[15:20.97]I got big ass arms and big ass shoulders.
[15:23.59]Alright, I'm okay with that.
[15:28.71]I have like a tiny little waist, a huge ass, huge shoulders, and big biceps and tiny forearms.
[15:37.75]I look like an ant.
[15:39.43]I have like a weird endomorphic ant body.
[15:47.35]Okay.
[15:47.53]That looks good.
[15:50.75]Uh, hair.
[15:51.29]Let's change this.
[15:57.83]Um, hairstyle one.
[15:59.17]Hairstyle... Oh, there's different variations too.
[16:01.51]Hold on.
[16:01.75]Let's go to variations.
[16:04.64]Alright, that's kind of accurate.
[16:09.16]If I got a haircut, this is what it would look like.
[16:11.02]That's why I'm afraid to get a haircut.
[16:18.57]Why am I turning this way?
[16:20.75]Oh, there we go.
[16:21.63]Ponytail, middle... No, I don't want a low ponytail.
[16:24.47]Alright, that's not bad.
[16:25.77]It's not.
[16:38.43]EMCA?
[16:41.32]I don't know what to do.
[16:42.26]Look.
[16:46.74]Look, you know what?
[16:47.80]At this point, I've played this song like eight times already.
[16:51.76]It's been played like ten times.
[16:55.35]What?
[16:56.27]Make sure you mute it after the eleventh, twelfth time it plays on stream.
[17:00.29]I'm already fucked if it's here.
[17:01.51]I think you swag land gaming for the five community subs.
[17:07.32]Appreciate it.
[17:11.41]Yeah, at this point, like, if you rob the bank, like, you go and it's like, oh, I'm here to rob the bank.
[17:20.17]It's like, the register's open.
[17:23.03]You don't go, you know, I'll take a $5 bill.
[17:25.17]No, I'm already robbing the bank, so I'm already here.
[17:41.07]He admits he's a criminal.
[17:44.73]You're going to rob the bank, you might as well go rob the bank in a Cadillac.
[17:55.79]No, that's what I'm saying.
[17:57.09]I'm saying like, if the bank is already being robbed, you're not going to ask for like $1.50 in quarters.
[18:13.34]What if I shave the top of my head?
[18:16.08]What is this shaving?
[18:33.03]My hair is kind of like... That's kind of like Lego hair, right?
[18:36.86]Everybody says I have.
[18:39.91]Is your bulge?
[18:41.85]I thought you were serious.
[18:42.69]I was like, oh shit.
[18:46.23]It's like that.
[18:46.81]Okay, that looks fine.
[18:52.98]Alright.
[18:56.06]Let's go back.
[18:57.62]Ace.
[19:02.43]I gotta get these glasses off.
[19:07.67]How do I get this thing off my- how do I get the glasses off?
[19:10.80]Okay, yeah, we're taking this off.
[19:15.62]Oh god, alright.
[19:17.96]We're going to the Lord of the Rings Dwarf.
[19:21.70]We gotta get the right face.
[19:45.66]Here it is again.
[19:46.48]This song.
[19:51.19]Oh my god.
[19:51.91]That one's not bad.
[19:57.41]Neither is that one.
[20:00.87]That one's not bad either.
[20:13.26]Fuck that's I think that's the one oh, yeah, that's the one for sure.
[20:18.18]I don't need to even see any other option No no mustaches or beards or anything That kind of looked like that mask do I wear a mask?
[20:42.34]No.
[20:42.92]Why do you have a huge bulge?
[20:45.42]I didn't make that.
[20:46.22]The game made that for me.
[20:47.34]This is me in a shitty Gambit costume.
[20:59.53]No, no mask.
[21:00.19]This is gonna be me.
[21:00.91]Eyewear?
[21:05.25]Do I have glasses?
[21:10.75]People are gonna want me to wear the hat, but I don't want to wear the hat.
[21:18.19]Oh, I'm gonna go none.
[21:18.83]Alright, no, we don't need any of that.
[21:25.10]Head shape.
[21:26.38]Normal.
[21:27.60]Slim.
[21:29.40]Chubby.
[21:29.76]That actually is pretty good.
[21:38.43]That's kind of accurate looking.
[21:39.91]Don't you think?
[21:45.62]Squashed head?
[21:46.38]No, not that one.
[21:48.84]Not even close.
[21:50.26]Not that one either.
[21:51.23]Is it big nose?
[21:52.83]It might be.
[21:53.89]What the hell?
[21:56.33]It's this one.
[21:56.69]I don't think I can hear very many arguments against it.
[22:19.57]Okay.
[22:20.83]I like it.
[22:25.17]I just realized I have all this chest hair.
[22:26.88]Hold on.
[22:27.18]Let me move my microphone a little bit.
[22:34.14]What's wrong with my... Oh.
[22:38.32]Material.
[22:42.15]Over pattern?
[22:42.83]Under pattern?
[22:43.45]Oh, okay.
[22:44.03]Hold on.
[22:47.29]Or is that like an open vest?
[22:59.42]Oh yeah.
[22:59.84]No, no, no way.
[23:03.86]Uh, how come I'm not seeing any of this?
[23:05.61]Under pattern.
[23:07.61]Over pattern material?
[23:12.95]Oh, that's why.
[23:13.57]Okay.
[23:17.51]Do I even have anything under?
[23:18.51]This is how Ken Shamrock used to come to the ring.
[23:25.18]I remember he used to have like this tiny denim vest.
[23:28.70]that probably was uncomfortable to be in.
[23:31.56]He was awesome, by the way.
[23:34.14]Is that a tuxedo vest?
[23:35.64]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[23:39.10]I kinda like the... Hey, what time is it, everybody?
[24:04.37]Yes, an email from... D Entertainment.
[24:11.88]I don't know.
[24:12.30]I don't know who made this song.
[24:16.40]You are being sued for playing my time 65 times in a row on stream.
[24:22.39]Each offense is worth $15,000.
[24:26.87]Therefore, bringing your total lawyer fees up to... I don't know what song this is.
[24:42.90]Who sings this song?
[24:43.74]Whose song is this?
[24:44.46]Is this Kanye?
[24:45.30]No, it's not.
[24:46.70]Is this Kanye?
[25:07.27]Alright, I'm going with this because I don't know.
[25:22.62]I don't even care.
[25:24.21]Wait, is this fireworks?
[25:30.59]Does that say I am verified with like a blue checkmark or something?
[25:35.92]I feel like that's the kind of shirt people would wear around.
[25:40.28]You'd wear that to Starbucks and just hope somebody looked at it and was like, oh, you are?
[25:49.13]This is fine.
[25:50.05]I don't care.
[25:50.55]The costume doesn't match.
[25:52.83]Should I have like a bow tie?
[25:58.71]No, no collar.
[26:01.61]Shape, tight or baggy?
[26:03.51]We'll do tight.
[26:06.74]Keep the choker on.
[26:07.48]I'm not keeping the choker on.
[26:08.80]Do we have tattoos?
[26:22.46]Elbow pads.
[26:23.06]Alright, yeah.
[26:24.90]Elbow pads.
[26:26.54]Wristbands.
[26:27.30]I want to keep the gloves on.
[26:29.86]Nope.
[26:30.42]Those are smokes.
[26:31.38]I can't take those.
[26:34.93]Skeleton hands?
[26:37.00]No.
[26:37.40]Yes.
[26:37.64]What the fuck?
[26:43.64]Why did it turn into a Roblox character?
[26:50.12]I have to mute this otherwise like what the fuck am I doing?
[26:52.85]Alright, whatever.
[26:55.09]I'm going.
[26:55.55]Legs.
[27:07.92]Those are just dastardly Richard's pants.
[27:11.00]I'm Jerma Rumble.
[27:11.84]Alright.
[27:25.12]Is it paint splatters?
[27:25.80]It's paint splatters.
[27:26.50]Alright, we're going to do paint splatters.
[27:28.74]Just be in a diaper.
[27:29.38]I'm going to wear just swishy pants.
[27:35.10]That's what I wear every day.
[27:48.53]Oh, God.
[27:49.17]Wait, why do I have... Hold on.
[27:55.42]Skirt with a swishy pants stripe on it and swishy pants.
[28:02.54]Alright, I kind of want the shorts and the pants.
[28:11.65]Length.
[28:16.43]Bike shorts?
[28:17.07]Alright, we're gonna keep it like this.
[28:18.73]I just wear bike shorts?
[28:33.78]No, I like that, it's stupid.
[28:37.04]Alright, this is my wrestling attire.
[28:41.20]This is my casual attire.
[28:42.58]I'm gonna do this really quickly.
[28:46.48]What if my casual attire was a different person's face?
[28:56.34]Oh shit, no, you can't.
[28:57.80]I forgot what face I had.
[28:58.40]There it is.
[28:59.36]Yeah, you can't change that.
[29:00.48]That's too bad.
[29:14.12]Alright, casual would just be like a t-shirt.
[29:16.16]Worst game ever.
[29:17.54]I don't agree with that yet.
[29:23.13]I would just say big green shirt.
[29:26.13]That was just the jermaOn H5 colors, right?
[29:27.79]It's just like that kind of greenish blue and like pink.
[29:32.34]Yeah, let's do that.
[29:44.86]Oh, material.
[29:47.16]What is this second pattern here?
[29:49.48]What's this shit on my arms?
[29:56.87]Oh, that's arms.
[29:57.53]Okay, okay.
[30:14.33]Is it just the Riddler?
[30:16.69]Well, you only think it's the Riddler because they have those goggles on.
[30:19.79]Just wait until they take the goggles off.
[30:21.09]How do you make pink?
[30:24.53]Here we go.
[30:24.86]Alright, there we go.
[30:28.68]But I don't want it to look like that.
[30:30.52]There.
[30:33.20]That's better.
[30:34.90]It's a little lighter than that, isn't it?
[30:45.82]It looks fine.
[30:47.24]No gloves.
[30:48.36]I'm not going to wear gloves just hanging out like at a coffee shop.
[30:54.04]Legs, we're going to do green and we'll do pink.
[30:56.78]Whatever.
[30:57.48]Yeah.
[31:09.03]Imagine how much of a fucking weirdo you'd have to be to, like, dress in your, like, channel branding colors every day when you went out to, like, the grocery store.
[31:19.83]Like, why would you do that?
[31:20.71]What would the point of that be?
[31:21.74]Why would you be doing that?
[31:23.56]Why?
[31:31.22]It's a flex?
[31:32.06]But it wouldn't even be a flex, though, because nobody would know that that's you.
[31:35.68]They would just see the colors.
[31:38.86]And like this green and like pink and blue, it's a very popular color scheme.
[31:57.91]I look like I'm in an 80s workout video.
[32:01.05]Do I have 80s workout video color scheme?
[32:05.49]I do, don't I?
[32:13.12]Yeah, I do.
[32:14.12]That's fine.
[32:22.02]This is not matching the top.
[32:23.58]Whatever.
[32:23.86]Do I really care that much?
[32:27.47]Maybe a little bit.
[32:36.94]Less blue?
[32:37.42]I think it's less blue, yeah.
[32:39.36]No.
[32:39.64]Less blue, less green.
[32:41.54]Less red?
[32:43.16]Less blue.
[32:43.62]150, 30, 100.
[32:49.99]150.
[32:50.01]30.
[32:50.03]100.
[32:50.21]Fuck.
[32:50.37]Different material.
[32:50.95]Oh, shit.
[32:51.21]Okay.
[32:53.69]Okay.
[33:06.21]There we go, alright.
[33:07.15]Perfect.
[33:12.23]It's perfect!
[33:13.09]So that's casual.
[33:15.93]This is when I come to the ring-in.
[33:18.00]Hold on, I want to change the... Mmm... I want, yeah, I want tucked in.
[33:31.99]Yeah, that's better.
[33:35.05]And then referee.
[33:38.63]I don't think I need to change referee.
[33:40.27]What do you mean ref?
[33:41.25]I can be a referee?
[33:42.51]Can I do a career as a referee?
[33:46.43]Holy shit, this would be the best game ever.
[33:48.29]Can I just be the referee?
[33:50.43]Alright, I'm ready.
[33:58.38]What just happened?
[33:59.12]Oh my god, I just freaked out.
[34:00.22]Alright, we're fine.
[34:06.27]moves alright this is I'm not gonna take that much time doing this but like I kind of want to so like whatever we're gonna be here for a while alright these are taunts those entrance I like that taunt go away
[34:31.85]Go to sleep.
[34:34.30]That's good.
[34:34.72]I like that.
[34:35.12]Let's see if there's a jermaWalk.
[34:38.44]That's footwork.
[34:41.96]Not that one.
[34:43.28]Not that one.
[34:44.86]Not that one.
[34:46.92]That one's not bad.
[34:48.60]Here or there.
[34:49.40]Hold camera.
[34:51.44]What do you mean I can come up with a camera?
[34:54.86]Invite applause.
[34:56.42]Make decision.
[34:58.45]Make a point.
[35:00.39]Middle finger.
[35:02.44]microphone speech oh that's good too that's good too I like that maybe the combo this is I love this already alright hold on we're gonna do the footwork one not go to sleep
[35:34.47]Yes!
[35:35.04]The Hulk Hogan.
[35:35.72]Classic move.
[35:38.36]Special?
[35:40.04]Oh, this is what happens when you have a special.
[35:41.86]Do the rumble in this game?
[35:48.41]I'm... Look, I blocked out two days for this game.
[35:51.21]So, it's today and tomorrow.
[35:55.17]Because I really feel like I'm going to be obsessed with this game for the next at least two days.
[36:01.50]Present punch the air.
[36:02.78]Raise the roof.
[36:04.78]I like raised finger.
[36:06.02]Roar.
[36:06.14]Rub fingers?
[36:06.42]Oh, I don't like that.
[36:07.70]Alright, that one's fine.
[36:08.49]I'm assuming this is when you win?
[36:29.86]That's a static backflip.
[36:31.35]It's like holy shit.
[36:32.17]That's perfect Just be wave I like that Yes movement Unbelievable
[37:01.16]I think I want power.
[37:05.54]Point at face.
[37:06.36]Point at chest.
[37:07.18]Pat stomach.
[37:08.98]That one's good.
[37:10.49]Stance.
[37:11.79]Fists high.
[37:12.41]Fists low.
[37:15.77]Martial arts.
[37:18.45]Grappler.
[37:20.25]Low grappler.
[37:23.83]Powerful.
[37:25.85]Feminine.
[37:27.27]Default.
[37:29.41]I think I'd be a guy.
[37:30.11]I'd be like this.
[37:32.14]Let's see.
[37:32.60]Hands up?
[37:33.40]No, it'd be hands down.
[37:38.01]It might even be hands lower.
[37:43.19]Do you know what this reminds me of?
[37:44.59]Those of you guys that played, uh, like, FIFA or MLB The Show or Madden, they had a playlist feature where you could go in and, oh, I don't want to hear this song that often.
[37:56.94]Maybe I want to hear this one a little less often.
[37:59.12]You could remove songs completely.
[38:02.64]from the playlist and I remember going in there when I was younger and just having the same two or three songs that I really liked on loop that's what this is like I just I only have one song in the playlist that I like the only one even in like the WWE games I remember playing uh
[38:23.65]What's Test's, uh, song?
[38:27.03]On this day, I see clearly, everything is ca- But that song.
[38:33.37]I used to play that on repeat when I was editing people.
[38:36.58]That's Edge.
[38:37.86]Well, whatever.
[38:38.36]I'm sorry.
[38:43.24]I used to put that song on repeat while I was making Earthworm Jim back in, like, 2014.
[38:46.89]That's not a- That's a real story.
[38:50.55]Alright, we're good.
[38:53.87]What a fake fan.
[38:54.81]Whatever.
[38:57.72]Alright, that's gestures.
[39:01.12]I have to play something else.
[39:03.44]Because I cannot listen to that for another 30 minutes while I make moves.
[39:10.33]And that's nothing to the song, right?
[39:13.72]That's nothing about what I feel about the actual song.
[39:17.96]It's just hearing it that many times in a row.
[39:20.15]I need something else, right?
[39:22.09]So I'm going to put on a little OST or something.
[39:24.73]I'm sorry, I have to.
[39:28.41]How about... What's something that I can just chill and make this character?
[39:35.30]Undertale OST.
[39:36.86]Oh, but that's so good and so easy.
[39:42.09]Cuphead music, holy shit, what a brilliant idea.
[39:44.59]That's actually kind of a brilliant idea.
[39:50.67]I don't know how to hear this.
[40:03.24]Oh, it's because I turned it down, okay.
[40:10.84]Oh, I can't hear this, why?
[40:15.18]Turn on penis music.
[40:16.62]Why can I not hear this?
[40:18.06]But you can.
[40:18.64]That's kind of strange.
[40:24.63]Why can I hear this?
[40:25.49]But now I can't.
[40:28.13]Oh, because I'm stupid.
[40:30.31]I turned it down on my mixer.
[40:31.49]Alright, let's go.
[40:36.31]I can handle this.
[40:37.71]This is like character creator music.
[40:40.53]Alright, so we need... What do we got?
[40:49.26]Attacks.
[40:50.84]This is just like No Mercy, man.
[40:52.32]I can already tell you.
[40:53.18]I already know.
[40:53.66]Trebi, punch her.
[40:59.16]I don't want to look at any of the moves.
[41:01.02]Slap.
[41:01.45]Is there one that goes across the face, not down?
[41:09.33]Is this DMCA?
[41:10.15]What?
[41:15.53]Is it DMCA?
[41:16.03]DMCA?
[41:19.52]What the fuck?
[41:22.58]Why?
[41:26.58]No.
[41:33.35]You know what's crazy?
[41:35.65]Like, a lot of video game musical artists that, like, just kind of don't care.
[41:39.37]Isn't it weird that, like, a lot of their music is, like, just better than the shit that gets DMCA'd?
[41:45.49]Am I, like, is that a shit take?
[41:47.71]Tell me.
[41:56.29]How about, uh... I'm not putting that back on.
[42:06.32]Skullgirls OST?
[42:11.08]Yeah, Terraria's good.
[42:12.66]That's an easy one to go back to, yeah.
[42:14.18]Terraria OST.
[42:16.52]Great one.
[42:16.88]There we go, okay.
[42:26.67]I think it's gonna be the slap.
[42:28.75]This one, it's way bigger.
[42:29.71]Alright, that's slap.
[42:33.33]Lower attack, left extension kick.
[42:37.74]I like left hook.
[42:41.72]That one's not bad.
[42:42.38]I think it should just be punches.
[42:45.36]I would never kick.
[42:46.00]No, I physically cannot lift my leg higher than probably the middle of my waist.
[42:57.18]I'll tell you, if you and I ever get in a fight, just go for the legs.
[43:00.46]Because I'm a puncher.
[43:02.70]You know what I mean?
[43:03.46]Like, if I'm in a situation where I was going to have to fight somebody, it would be a flurry of right and left hands.
[43:09.88]So fast that you wouldn't even be able to see them.
[43:12.34]It would be like... And you were on the ground like three of those ago, by the way.
[43:23.36]My legs are useless.
[43:33.90]Big attack.
[43:34.60]Bicycle kick?
[43:35.36]No.
[43:39.66]That's just me falling on my back.
[43:45.00]Oh, at first I thought that was part of the move.
[43:46.46]I was like, holy shit.
[43:49.08]Diving clothesline?
[43:52.82]Yeah, it would probably just be a huge punch.
[43:59.57]Holy shit.
[44:03.28]Although, seriously, don't underestimate just running and jumping with all of your body weight at somebody, right?
[44:19.26]How does that not hurt you more than it hurts the person you're doing that to?
[44:21.74]Headbutt's pretty nuts.
[44:29.16]Wait, it is a move.
[44:31.96]Yep.
[44:33.29]Running attack?
[44:39.36]It would be that one.
[44:40.46]A huge running, diving punch in the face.
[44:46.12]I think this is off the top rope?
[44:50.59]I would do a flip of some kind, right?
[44:51.89]Yeah.
[44:58.41]But I definitely would be holding my neck because I would be kind of scared that I was going to break my neck and hurt myself.
[45:12.76]Okay, that one.
[45:15.34]Flying kick, flying clothesline.
[45:17.36]What's this one?
[45:18.36]Middle rope.
[45:23.54]Yep.
[45:26.48]Springboard attack.
[45:27.72]Moonsault.
[45:29.61]Oh, I think this is top rope.
[45:32.91]Super punch.
[45:33.93]Suicide dive.
[45:35.71]Wait, you just... I kind of want that one.
[45:43.35]Rushes.
[45:43.75]Oh, this is when they're on the ground.
[45:45.79]Punches.
[45:48.65]The rest of these can probably be pretty quick until we get to the grapples.
[45:52.57]What's this one?
[45:54.19]Big leg drop?
[45:55.21]Moonsault senton bomb.
[45:57.56]That one.
[45:59.14]Running move when they're on the ground?
[46:01.44]About, uh... How am I doing?
[46:04.52]I'm doing alright.
[46:05.10]I'm doing alright.
[46:07.78]I've kind of hurt myself a few days ago.
[46:09.58]Or a day or two ago.
[46:11.34]But, you know.
[46:11.78]I'll be alright.
[46:17.36]I don't want to be too ridiculous.
[46:18.60]This is way too ridiculous.
[46:19.80]I'm going to get so annoyed at doing these moves.
[46:22.96]Yeah, just like a splash is fine.
[46:26.14]That's fine too.
[46:28.34]Springboard?
[46:28.96]That one.
[46:34.13]There is one thing that I have to make sure, and I hope they have it, and I think they do, is my finishing move has to be the Stone Cold Stunner.
[46:42.15]That's incredibly important.
[46:47.23]This is top rope.
[46:55.95]Elbow drop?
[46:56.53]Yep.
[46:56.71]Alright, we're almost done.
[47:00.67]Front moves.
[47:02.01]Oh, God.
[47:03.20]Wait, who am I doing?
[47:03.90]I'm doing this myself?
[47:08.02]Suplex.
[47:09.18]Monkey flip.
[47:10.90]Monkey flip.
[47:14.48]Clothesline, choke slam.
[47:16.72]There's no way I would be able to do that to somebody.
[47:22.48]This does feel like a workout video of some kind, right?
[47:27.01]I'm surprised this hasn't happened yet.
[47:29.73]Oh, like UFC workout!
[47:32.27]You need two people.
[47:33.73]Get one of your buddies over.
[47:34.61]You're both going to be able to burn 500 calories an hour.
[47:38.21]Working your core, your abs, your obliques, and your calves at the same time.
[47:44.60]You just kick the shit out of each other.
[47:49.80]Like, you have to scoop slam your friend and then he scoop slams you.
[47:56.91]Only 500 an hour.
[48:01.37]Hmm.
[48:04.67]Oh, I like that.
[48:05.47]Into the submission.
[48:06.71]Hmm.
[48:08.39]Air crash?
[48:12.48]That would hurt so bad.
[48:20.81]I like closed line drop.
[48:21.92]Yep.
[48:23.74]We got monkey flip.
[48:24.54]I'm not going to have monkey flip be every move.
[48:26.34]So we're going to do this one.
[48:27.12]Over the shoulder.
[48:28.10]Well, there's no... Okay, that was crazy.
[48:30.15]Piledriver.
[48:30.71]Yeah, this move is banned, but we're going to use it.
[48:38.14]I like that.
[48:42.29]All monkey flip.
[48:44.33]Alright, we'll make a character eventually that has only monkey flip for a move.
[48:48.11]And it's going to be infuriating.
[48:49.47]There it is.
[48:50.92]Alright, but that's my special move though.
[48:52.30]Not a regular move.
[48:55.42]I love this stunner.
[48:56.40]It's like the best move ever.
[48:59.48]Test of strength.
[49:01.87]Need that one.
[49:05.05]Actually, for just a regular move though, that kind of sucks.
[49:12.63]Hurricanran is pretty sick.
[49:14.71]Crossbody's pretty sick.
[49:18.61]I like that one.
[49:21.17]Running?
[49:22.77]Spear.
[49:24.71]Run and slide is headlock takedown.
[49:27.68]Just make it a headbutt.
[49:31.14]Running and down is DDT.
[49:32.42]That's cooler.
[49:37.06]Pick up move.
[49:40.80]Oh, the Enziguri.
[49:44.18]Sunset Flip.
[49:48.31]What if every move was the stunner, though?
[49:50.15]Would that be better?
[49:50.75]Play the right version.
[49:55.59]What are you talking about?
[49:58.91]This is the... Wait, you... You want to play the old version of the game?
[50:02.12]This is the one that just came out like six days ago.
[50:05.46]Why are you beating up Hank Hill?
[50:17.33]Front power slam, I like it.
[50:19.63]Small package.
[50:21.48]Oh, I don't know, but they don't really know, they don't really know me very well.
[50:26.58]Uh, shoulder drop.
[50:30.08]Shoulder boulder.
[50:35.30]Screwdriver.
[50:35.92]Holy shit, that would kill somebody.
[50:40.11]Okay, momentum, monkey flip, alright, fine.
[50:44.93]Running.
[50:48.87]I like that.
[50:49.25]High crossbody.
[50:52.47]Diamond cutter.
[50:53.19]That was awesome.
[50:53.83]Hey, speaking of diamond cutter.
[50:56.56]Didn't Diamond Dallas Page make a Pilates or a yoga program?
[51:04.74]And it's actually like one of the best yoga platforms you can possibly do.
[51:10.44]Isn't DDP yoga considered to be like one of the top tier, like A or S tier yoga programs?
[51:17.71]Maybe I should get it.
[51:27.50]Half Crusher?
[51:28.90]Whoa, alright.
[51:29.54]That one's weird, I like it.
[51:36.02]Alright, here we go, Stunner.
[51:38.06]This is my special, this is my finishing move.
[51:43.53]But the Tombstone is awesome too, but there's no way I would be able to do the Tombstone.
[51:48.83]Stunner, yep.
[51:51.19]Nice, okay, rear moves.
[51:53.62]These are less important to me, I think.
[51:57.16]These can be fine.
[51:57.76]These are all fine.
[51:58.40]Just like a face plant, DDT.
[51:59.58]Yeah, that one's cool.
[52:02.41]How about rear special?
[52:04.39]Here we go.
[52:04.77]Dragon suplex.
[52:06.89]The electric chair.
[52:11.85]Burning hammer.
[52:13.56]Holy shit.
[52:16.28]Abdominal stretch.
[52:17.08]Yeah, I did one of these like three days ago and like tore a muscle in my shoulder.
[52:21.56]It sucked.
[52:22.08]I'm going to use it.
[52:27.05]In the corner.
[52:27.75]Head smashes?
[52:33.55]Oh.
[52:34.17]Yeah, I like those.
[52:34.78]Yeah, I'm doing mounted punches.
[52:43.20]Alright, so this is, uh, these are fine.
[52:49.11]Although I do want to do the, uh, the sharpshooter.
[52:54.34]Legs and attack.
[52:55.02]Do they have a sharpshooter?
[52:56.20]There it is.
[52:56.54]Dude, if you were in this... Dude, if... If... Right, the hitman heart put you in one of these.
[53:03.50]You weren't getting up.
[53:04.36]You were done.
[53:05.90]Right in the middle of the ring.
[53:06.74]You got nowhere to go.
[53:07.42]It's over.
[53:14.04]Legs and run.
[53:15.08]Half crab.
[53:15.68]I want a Boston crab.
[53:17.59]Yeah.
[53:17.79]Alright, that's good.
[53:24.74]And I think that's it.
[53:25.28]I just don't want to be Hecklehorn.
[53:28.96]Relationships.
[53:30.44]Promotion, I'm in wrestling school.
[53:31.86]Role, wrestler.
[53:32.66]Oh, I could be a referee, but should I just be a referee?
[53:39.45]No, I can't.
[53:40.39]We'll do that with another character.
[53:42.27]I want to be like a wrestler.
[53:44.47]I want to be a heel.
[53:45.83]Cloning, manager, I don't have any friends or anything.
[53:50.09]I'm just going to be like a lone guy.
[53:52.11]Okay.
[53:54.04]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[53:56.26]This is fine.
[53:56.80]We'll make our own friends and enemies as we play.
[54:01.18]I do need to change this name.
[54:02.55]From Hecklehorn.
[54:03.41]Uh, I think I have to type it.
[54:11.07]Uh... Why can I not press A?
[54:19.78]Okay.
[54:19.94]Alright, there we go.
[54:21.66]I can turn the Terraria soundtrack off.
[54:23.80]It was good.
[54:25.19]We can now go back to the actual game sounds.
[54:36.27]You might get to hear my time one more time.
[54:38.60]Alright, I'm ready.
[54:42.42]I'm excited.
[54:43.02]Yeah, I spent like an hour fucking around.
[54:44.98]But whatever.

[54:49.16]At least today into tomorrow.
[54:54.18]I thought this was Terraria still.
[54:57.37]Alright, we're good, we're good, we're good.

[56:43.20]This is where your story starts, Jerma.
[56:46.91]What?
[56:47.84]You'll have to learn the ropes here each week.
[56:50.32]For some people, it never happens, while others wish it had because they've up back here broken.
[56:53.48]Why is he holding a chair?
[56:57.96]Be careful what you sign up for because there'll be a lot of promoters trying to take advantage of you.

[58:42.52]This is not fair.
[58:43.30]How come the referee is not kicking this guy out of the ring?
[58:53.58]Yeah, get him out.
[58:56.98]Get this guy out of here.

[59:39.38]How do you throw him off the ropes?
[59:43.88]Ow.
[59:45.00]Wait, he just kicked me in the balls.
[59:45.84]That's illegal.
[59:49.81]I'm not gonna tap out.
[59:50.67]I'm fine.
[59:55.74]Get up.

[60:13.99]Wait, he's mad at the ref.
[60:15.00]I'm not fucking around anymore.
[60:26.34]How do you block?
[60:30.48]This guy's like two weight classes ahead of me.
[60:32.94]This is not even fair.
[60:33.80]This guy's like 400 pounds.
[60:36.51]I'm 150.
[60:37.09]Am I bleeding?
[60:43.35]There's not even an audience to do that for.
[60:55.44]Get on the top rope.
[60:57.82]I'm still winning.
[61:08.97]Oh, that was pretty sick.
[61:11.95]Pick him up.
[61:13.07]I must have a special, right?
[61:15.43]Why is he on the top rope?
[61:21.17]Should I try to pin him?
[61:30.44]He literally just kicked me in the balls.
[61:36.38]Get up!
[61:41.00]That's so stupid.
[61:44.00]What the fuck?
[61:45.92]Yeah, thanks a lot referee.
[61:46.94]It took you like a full three minutes.
[61:50.80]To kick the... To kick the guy out that was in the ring.
[61:55.05]That shouldn't have been in the ring.
[61:56.03]And he's still here.
[62:02.92]and his face exploded in blood how about the spin punch?
[62:10.18]oh my god, it worked five minutes remaining, we're taking too much time why can he just do that to me?
[62:30.39]reverse it
[62:34.40]God, I just want to throw in a weapon so bad.
[62:38.22]Um, hold on a second.
[62:40.94]No, not on the first match.
[62:42.36]I saw something down there.
[62:43.66]It's because you dumped all your stats into attitude.
[62:48.59]Well, I better get some points for this.
[62:59.47]Oh, it's over.
[63:00.05]Pin him.
[63:00.29]How do you pin?
[63:02.48]Pin?
[63:05.65]Oh, fuck you.
[63:08.28]Stay down.
[63:14.84]Stay down!
[63:26.55]I need a special.
[63:29.53]What the fuck just happened?
[63:31.08]Oh my god, I think I killed him.
[63:41.19]Get over here!
[63:45.25]What the fuck was that?
[63:46.39]Ow!
[63:53.44]Ow!
[63:54.36]Ow, my chest!
[63:56.52]Ugh!
[63:58.50]This game's gonna be bad for me, I already know it.
[64:01.44]I didn't even need to start, I just started too.
[64:04.90]Ugh!
[64:09.37]Is he gonna get up?
[64:11.57]Go on the top turnbuckle.
[64:19.89]Just taunt in the ring.
[64:26.64]What happened to this guy?
[64:37.44]Oh shit, he grabbed me.
[64:42.36]At nine?
[64:43.02]Are you fucking kidding me?
[64:44.14]No way.
[64:47.77]Get off me.
[64:52.43]There's only five minutes remaining.
[64:57.79]Wait, he's getting sick of this.
[64:59.79]Wait, you're gonna get disqualified.
[65:01.42]Isn't he gonna get disqualified?
[65:16.09]We're both so fucked up right now.
[65:17.97]Why can't either of us win?
[65:19.15]We're both so fucked up.
[65:23.95]Just pin him.
[65:27.45]I can't win.
[65:28.31]Look at how screwed up we are.
[65:36.59]At what point does the ref stop the match?
[65:38.57]Because this is just embarrassing and horrible for both of us.
[65:43.04]What?
[65:50.39]This is the practice match?
[65:56.99]Alright.
[65:57.57]I gotta go for a big move here.
[65:59.53]Right here.
[65:59.85]Right in the head.
[66:02.67]Goodnight.
[66:08.04]I was at a one count.
[66:15.64]Stay down!
[66:18.86]Stay down!
[66:21.51]This one minute, we're about to hit the enrage timer.
[66:24.62]Does the referee start fucking punching us?
[66:29.88]Get over here.
[66:32.52]Alright, that's it.
[66:36.41]There it is!
[66:41.11]Wait, I've just received word from backstage that this match must be restarted immediately.
[66:46.74]What?
[66:50.81]What are you talking about?
[66:51.68]He just gave me the finger, that guy just flipped me off.
[66:55.90]That's not fair!
[67:01.85]What are you talking about?
[67:04.53]What?
[67:25.09]He's just like killing me.
[67:34.58]I'm like puking.
[67:37.20]What the fuck?
[67:38.66]It's not fair, dude.
[67:40.98]No, give me that bat.
[67:43.21]Give me that bat.
[67:49.68]Oh!
[67:50.14]Jerm, I'm here to challenge you to a match on the fourth week of July!
[67:54.18]Oh!
[67:54.24]You really?
[67:56.84]Alright, if this is the only way to get your attention, you'll agree to face me in front of the whole... Alright, it's a date?
[68:09.13]Alright, I kind of... Fuck this guy.
[68:10.77]Alright, it's a date.
[68:12.79]Get off of me!
[68:14.25]I guess you're not the coward I thought you were.
[68:15.95]At least you'll put up a fight before you lose...
[68:20.56]Wait, I'm fighting this guy right now?
[68:23.88]What are you talking about?
[68:26.20]Isn't this the 4th of July?
[68:28.35]What day is it?
[68:31.89]What fucking day is it right now?
[68:34.97]I think it's, I think, that's Blond Blunder.
[68:37.22]That's the guy.
[68:38.02]It says he's, I'm fighting him.
[68:45.08]THAT'S ILLEGAL!
[68:46.08]THAT'S ILLEGAL!
[68:47.38]THROW HIM OUTTA HERE!
[68:48.48]THAT WAS ILLEGAL!
[68:49.20]HE JUST THREW A BAT IN MY HEAD!
[68:50.64]THAT SHIT'S ILLEGAL!
[68:54.02]THAT'S ILLEGAL!
[68:55.33]HE JUST THREW A BAT AT ME!
[68:57.57]Okay, you know when you play Bloodborne and you kill like fucking 30 people?
[69:02.29]And your clothes are just covered in blood?
[69:09.13]This is so unfair!
[69:19.25]Just pin me already.
[69:20.23]Am I even supposed to win this?
[69:25.31]Stop.
[69:25.63]He's dead already.
[69:26.77]I know.
[69:27.53]What's... How do I get out of... I have no control of the character.
[69:32.85]Okay.
[69:39.55]I have to pin this guy.
[69:42.11]Is there anything I can do to kill... Okay.
[69:44.42]You know what?
[69:44.76]Fuck it.
[69:46.12]That guy didn't get disqualified, so neither am I. Yeah, drop it.
[69:48.99]Okay.
[69:51.65]Are you... Ow!
[70:04.71]Ow!
[70:09.15]This is so stupid.
[70:10.31]I love it.
[70:11.15]This game is amazing.
[70:12.31]This is like the first match.
[70:15.88]Fuck you!
[70:17.82]Yeah, disqualified apparently!
[70:22.97]It's me who decides who wins and loses, Jerma, and I've decided that you're a loser!
[70:32.25]Why can I still fight?
[70:45.37]I need a second.
[70:46.93]I need to take it like a hold on.
[70:47.99]I need like a five second break Oh, okay
[71:05.76]So, the wrestling review.
[71:07.68]In all the latest action from Wrestling School's training session, Jerma was disqualified at 12 minutes and 17 seconds.
[71:15.72]Jerma's strength has risen to 70% after participating in that match.
[71:23.52]In all the latest action, Tall Order's profile has risen after taking part in such a compelling match.
[71:31.29]Blonde Blunder has generated a buzz by interfering in that one.
[71:36.63]And I made... I lost $200.
[71:40.51]Because I used an explosive or something?
[71:44.60]Is that what it was?
[71:45.34]Expenses?
[71:50.06]What is this?
[71:50.90]I see you had fun out there, Jerma, but you made quite a mess of the arena.
[71:56.28]Okay.
[71:58.65]If we ever want to book this venue again, you better pay $100 towards the damages.
[72:02.91]How about you referee?
[72:09.18]That's absolute bullshit.
[72:12.62]Why are there sticks of dynamite in your arena?
[72:16.32]Lit.
[72:17.88]That have like a hairpin trigger.
[72:20.86]If they're touched.
[72:22.12]What are you talking about?
[72:23.62]That's not my problem.
[72:28.44]It really isn't.
[72:31.15]I suppose you're right.
[72:31.97]What did they expect when they let a wrestling show into the venue?
[72:38.70]right I got it third week of July your bat prop costs money I hope it doesn't new middleweight champion hooker hudson has defeated greg mcmahon to become the new middleweight champion of weekend warriors crucial kennedy feels great today and is in perfect health blonde blunder has developed a heated rivalry with jigsaw Jeremy of all-American wrestling
[73:08.84]Yeah, that guy sucks.
[73:09.86]Jerma's proposed match against Blonde Blunder on the 4th week of July has been cancelled.
[73:17.44]Oh.
[73:21.30]So what was that all about?
[73:22.46]That guy just fucked up the whole match, came down, challenged me to a duel, and then cancelled on me.
[73:34.71]Somehow I lost popularity.
[73:35.93]A lot of it.
[73:38.86]okay well proceed alright I gotta win this one singles let's go who is it oh wait I thought he cancelled on me wait he cancelled and moved it up to the third week of July instead of the fourth week of July what are the rules of this match can he just hold that
[74:18.75]Put it down.
[74:20.09]I'm not putting mine down until he puts his down.
[74:24.73]I'm not getting in there until he puts it down.
[74:28.35]Referee got a camera.
[74:29.95]Why does he have a camera?
[74:41.52]Wait, are we allowed to have these?
[74:45.78]Anybody who couldn't beat Tall Order doesn't belong in the ring with me.
[74:53.51]Tall Order is nothing compared to me, and that makes you less than nothing.
[75:00.59]Holy shit, my mouth.
[75:07.62]That's so unfair.
[75:09.58]That's unfair.
[75:11.12]That's unfair.
[75:11.76]I ran at him, and I was like a bull.
[75:15.80]Get away from me.
[75:19.38]Why is my health so low already?
[75:20.68]He's just doing my moves?
[75:24.16]Alright, I gotta play this smart.
[75:30.05]God damn it.
[75:35.47]Get that shit out of the ring, please.
[75:40.05]Here we go.
[75:40.39]Alright, slow and steady.
[75:44.50]I don't know what just happened, but I got hurt.
[75:52.23]I let go of him.
[75:54.69]Why did I let go of him?
[75:57.55]That was good.
[75:58.31]Pick him up.
[75:58.59]Alright, good.
[76:05.00]Momentum.
[76:05.44]Keep going.
[76:13.27]Good.
[76:14.19]Come on.
[76:15.45]I grappled him.
[76:16.21]Why did he reverse it?
[76:16.91]Let go of me.
[76:20.56]Let go.
[76:20.78]Let go.
[76:21.00]Let go.
[76:21.20]Let go.
[76:21.40]Let go.
[76:26.96]Why can't I reverse moves?
[76:39.91]That's my move of choice.
[76:41.03]And the spin one.
[76:48.85]God!
[76:50.11]Why?
[76:51.41]What the fuck?
[77:01.06]I need somebody to come interfere for me on my behalf, right?
[77:06.32]Is he biting me?
[77:07.09]I hear bites.
[77:13.33]Get off of me!
[77:17.63]Let go of my neck!
[77:20.53]Alright, I'm gonna win.
[77:21.29]I'm gonna do a coward's play here.
[77:24.49]Is it 10 count?
[77:28.79]That was pretty good.
[77:31.58]Double disqualification is the only way I can win.
[77:43.44]Don't let him get out.
[77:44.08]Don't let him leave.
[77:47.15]I win!
[77:49.51]Oh...
[77:57.27]oh my god this okay I feel like I don't tap don't tap don't tap don't tap don't tap
[78:26.06]Alright, I'm not doing that bad considering I started with less health.
[78:38.73]I gotta do some reversals.
[78:41.59]I think it's just random though.
[78:47.95]Alright, come here.
[78:51.60]How did I hurt my balls?
[78:53.48]Jumping.
[78:55.85]If I use the bat, I'm gonna get disqualified.
[79:00.37]God, how does he keep hitting me in the balls?
[79:06.43]Get up!
[79:07.61]What the fuck?
[79:08.67]It's not fair!
[79:09.59]I started with half health!
[79:20.36]Jerma's profile has suffered considerable... considerably after being defeated so easily.
[79:28.44]Blonde Blunder's progress is being hindered by the limitations of wrestling school.
[79:36.67]I'm taking the bat away.
[79:37.49]I'm literally losing money.
[79:45.49]Mary Class has defeated Ivy Windsor to become the new Women's Champion of Maple Leaf Grappling.
[79:50.83]Alright, gimmick.
[79:56.89]Whoa!
[79:58.80]Why is that?
[79:59.08]Why am I losing strength?
[80:00.08]What was that?
[80:00.80]That was weird.
[80:02.48]What was that?
[80:09.02]Get this prop out of here.
[80:14.86]Yeah.
[80:15.42]No, none.
[80:15.99]I'm just wasting money.
[80:16.71]That's me training strength?
[80:24.01]You were losing health to gain strength.
[80:25.79]Alright, I'm gonna go for one more attempt.
[80:28.11]Proceed.
[80:35.61]I took the bat off.
[80:40.96]Whack Axe will visit school on the third week of August to inspire the students.
[80:47.08]What the fuck?
[80:48.34]Danny Might could not be woken from his sleep this morning.
[80:50.84]The 51-year-old veteran is thought to have died of natural causes.
[80:54.11]What?
[80:56.97]What the fuck?
[80:58.87]The industry will come together this week to stage a special tribute in memory of Danny Might.
[81:07.29]Nice to meet you, Jerma.
[81:08.27]We invited you here to discuss working for Rising Sun Pururesu.
[81:11.89]Is this a new promotion?
[81:15.23]You're not exactly a priority for us right now, but we'd consider bringing you in with this deal.
[81:24.94]Advance.
[81:26.20]$200 per week for 32 weeks.
[81:27.88]No creative control.
[81:29.48]May not make or refuse any changes.
[81:34.15]Um...
[81:36.29]That seems like, that doesn't, that sucks.
[81:40.00]Wait.
[81:41.14]I want, I want $500 a week.
[81:44.00]I want creative control.
[81:46.38]And I want, and I want $2,000 up front, and I want $800 a week.
[81:50.52]And I want it for 30, 28 weeks.
[81:57.08]Who do you think you are to make those demands?
[81:59.09]You're obviously not taking this very seriously.
[82:05.47]I just put it back.
[82:06.65]Nothing has changed since the last time you proposed that.
[82:09.09]You're obviously not willing to compromise.
[82:11.27]I didn't mean to do that.
[82:13.25]Alright, well, obviously not getting anywhere.
[82:14.51]Let's just forget about it for the time being.
[82:18.54]Smoke!
[82:20.26]Hey, Chairman.
[82:20.84]I understand you've got a match against Slasher Sweetie tonight.
[82:25.00]Shmo- Smoke Mentor Ark?
[82:27.50]How would you like me to take him out for you?
[82:29.36]If you give me $130, I'll make sure he hobbles to the ring.
[82:40.59]That's, what?
[82:42.01]No problem.
[82:42.65]Consider the match won already.
[82:43.97]Once I'm finished with him, there won't be much left.
[82:50.00]What is this music?
[82:53.42]Why is this slow?
[82:55.66]This is, wait, guys, this is my time, but it's slowed down.
[82:59.54]Why is this happening?
[83:12.64]Okay, here we go.
[83:15.16]Proceed.
[83:17.12]Singles match.
[83:17.74]Oh, we got a crowd this time.
[83:22.21]Karma!
[83:22.89]And with Coach Emerson.
[83:24.41]Why is he coming out here?
[83:31.83]Why does the referee have a mask on and a bat?
[83:38.66]Waving to the fans.
[83:43.92]Slasher Sweeney with Lance Monaco.
[83:45.89]He's all fucked up, but he has a microphone too.
[83:53.20]I just tried to throw the microphone at him.
[83:56.42]I just threw the microphone at him.
[84:08.56]Who's giving the finger to who?
[84:10.66]This show is dedicated to the memory of Danny Might, who recently passed away.
[84:14.86]What the?
[84:15.32]Get away from me.
[84:17.86]Danny Might's work in this ring meant a lot to fans, but the person who was backstage meant even more to us.
[84:23.35]Who am I talking to?
[84:25.65]He lived for his family, and through them, he lives on.
[84:27.77]We hope the donations from this show bring them comfort.
[84:30.91]Oh, wait.
[84:31.57]This is... Oh.
[84:33.95]That's enough talking.
[84:34.79]Danny Might is sitting up there waiting for a show, so let's give him one.
[84:37.79]Did I like...
[84:39.69]sabotage this guy on a charity event?
[84:43.87]Are you fucking kidding me?
[84:52.05]This guy's not getting up.
[85:02.80]Get the fuck out of here.
[85:07.13]Oh, yeah?
[85:07.97]Eat this!
[85:16.82]Wait, what?
[85:19.02]What the fuck?
[85:19.71]I can hurt the people in the- I can hurt these people?
[85:23.23]Wait, why?
[85:23.99]What?
[85:28.80]Where is he?
[85:49.59]Oh shit, he got up.
[85:51.45]Actually, I don't know, you could like attack the commentators?
[85:58.24]He's gaining health.
[85:59.62]Alright, no, no, no more fucking around.
[86:00.74]I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be, I'm like, here we go.
[86:08.66]No!
[86:19.94]I can't!
[86:21.48]I can't play this!
[86:25.02]This is so stupid!
[86:27.58]I can't!
[86:29.36]Ow!
[86:32.25]Why did he do that?
[86:36.03]Okay, I gotta settle down.
[86:37.23]Okay, I just... Come here.
[86:43.65]Just get down!
[86:44.91]Sit down already!
[86:48.44]This weird shit just keeps happening.
[86:50.32]I can't fucking focus.
[86:54.56]Why would the referee do that?
[86:57.56]Alright, get up.
[87:00.40]Alright, here we go.
[87:02.35]This is it.
[87:02.83]Tap out.
[87:08.49]That was a wheeze.
[87:10.07]All the air just left my body when the referee's clothesline.
[87:12.55]It doesn't make any sense.
[87:13.33]Why would a referee do that?
[87:18.08]That's it.
[87:22.86]What the fuck?
[87:29.95]This guy's pissed.
[87:35.01]That's a pin.
[87:37.68]Referee, get the fuck over here.
[87:39.08]Oh my god.
[87:47.50]Oh my god!
[87:48.40]This is it.
[87:56.57]Oh, he's not gonna get up from that one.
[87:57.63]It's over.
[87:58.63]I literally just broke his head.
[87:59.97]I smashed his skull.
[88:00.83]It's over.
[88:01.91]Got it.
[88:28.95]Slasher Sweeney has damaged the reputation of All-American Wrestling by failing to win that inter-promotional contest.
[88:37.18]Jerma's profile has improved considerably by winning at a major event.
[88:43.86]Lance Monaco is disappointed that his client lost that match.
[88:51.35]Alright.
[88:52.21]Holy shit, do I get some of that?
[88:59.34]$450,000?
[88:59.40]I only get $100?
[89:00.62]I don't get any money.
[89:01.94]I didn't get anything.
[89:05.42]Why?
[89:07.14]Oh, that was... Right, right.
[89:08.50]Never mind.
[89:08.90]Alright.
[89:09.37]I'm sorry.
[89:10.05]I forgot that was a charity event.
[89:12.07]I'm sorry.
[89:12.45]Alright.
[89:18.41]I forgot.

[90:20.66]That guy already has a grenade in his hand.
[90:23.17]So, I don't know what's going to happen with that.
[90:25.93]I don't know why he's holding it currently.
[90:28.07]But, he's looking at the referee.
[90:29.97]The referee's leaving the ring.
[90:31.15]Do you still have it?

[91:46.21]I don't want to have it be in the ring.
[91:50.65]Alright, here we go.
[91:51.67]Evenly matched.
[91:52.53]Except he's got 60 pounds on me.

[92:03.76]Fuck!
[92:10.64]Is it a dud?
[92:11.24]I don't think it is.
[92:24.08]Alright, I gotta fucking wrestle and do this the way that I do.
[92:28.70]There we are.
[92:29.08]That was a big move.
[92:29.78]Nice.
[92:41.69]Why is he... He just baited me.
[92:43.83]That was fucking ridiculous.
[92:47.13]He just caught my arm.
[92:48.51]Alright, step on his head.
[92:56.70]Wrench it.
[93:00.78]This is doing damage.
[93:11.13]Oh, my God.
[93:11.77]That is a bad place to be.
[93:13.09]Alright.
[93:18.36]I got to throw him against ropes, but that was nice.
[93:21.96]Good job.
[93:29.49]Monkey flip.
[93:30.09]Perfect.
[93:31.05]Good execution.
[93:41.03]Oh, he blocked it.

[93:42.05]Sorry.
[93:43.63]Rope break.
[93:49.92]Oh, fuck you.
[93:54.82]Still evenly matched.
[93:55.56]It's fine.
[94:05.03]Test of strength.
[94:05.73]I have no idea how to win.
[94:11.33]He just trampolined.
[94:17.18]He did a goofy scream.
[94:19.42]I was like... Holy shit.
[94:26.70]What did I just do to him?
[94:35.40]How do I do that again?
[94:40.39]Get out of here.
[94:41.55]Get that shit out of here.
[94:44.21]Oops.
[94:45.23]Sorry, he didn't see it.
[94:45.85]Move out of the way, Riff.

[95:08.12]Oops.
[95:08.66]I almost have my finisher.

[95:15.63]That hurts.
[95:21.77]Watch out.
[95:22.05]Run away.
[95:23.05]Just get away.
[95:23.59]Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away.
[95:32.56]Watch it.
[95:34.98]Where are you going?
[95:40.50]Are you fucking kidding me?
[95:41.76]That was a good move.
[95:42.60]I grabbed his ass and I spun him around.
[95:53.91]What the fuck?
[95:59.51]How is this guy doing this?
[96:00.67]It doesn't make any sense.
[96:09.56]Get in here.
[96:13.28]Alright, I just grabbed him.
[96:14.72]Why does he instantly reverse this shit?
[96:24.05]There it is.
[96:24.45]Nice.
[96:26.21]Alright, good, good.
[96:27.15]Keep it going.
[96:27.55]He's because he's stronger than you.
[96:38.06]Get out of the way, ref.
[96:39.08]Why would you stand in the way?
[96:47.59]Good.
[96:47.79]Alright, I still have the upper hand.
[96:49.51]I'm fine.
[96:55.95]Good.
[97:00.64]Grab him by the head.
[97:05.24]I gotta grab him.
[97:05.88]I gotta get him in the middle of the ring.
[97:12.46]Where's he going?
[97:12.98]Come here.
[97:14.20]Where'd he go?
[97:17.95]What the fuck are you doing?
[97:21.21]I have no idea what just happened, but I just fucked him up bad.
[97:24.81]Watch out for the bomb.
[97:25.43]I'm not touching that.
[97:33.29]Damn it.
[97:39.80]Ooh, that was worth a lot of points.
[97:41.06]Let me try that again.
[97:47.34]Oh, here we go.
[97:48.52]There's no rope here.
[97:49.32]I might get him to tap.
[97:52.30]This is it.
[97:53.46]There's no rope in sight.
[97:54.42]He's got low health.
[97:55.06]This is over.
[97:59.38]That's my special.
[98:00.12]It's almost there.
[98:00.68]Oh, we're gonna get to see the stunner!
[98:06.67]Yup.
[98:08.51]Come on!
[98:12.91]Tap out!
[98:14.43]Am I even putting pressure on him?
[98:15.49]What's going on?
[98:18.39]I feel like this guy's just letting me do this and just taking a breather for a few minutes.
[98:26.41]Like, this does not hurt him at all.
[98:28.05]And he's just like, thank God this guy, this wuss thinks he's hurting me.
[98:31.07]I can breathe for like five minutes.
[98:35.01]Rip his arm out of his socket.
[98:39.69]Oh my God.
[98:42.31]Why did I lose special for that?
[98:53.43]Yes!
[98:54.35]Here we go.
[98:54.89]It's over.
[98:56.85]It's time for the stunner!
[98:59.55]Good night.
[99:00.49]Game over.
[99:04.39]That's a popularity boost right there.
[99:12.92]Is this illegal?
[99:19.64]Why did I lose skill?
[99:22.20]Irma's profile has improved considerably by winning so convincingly.
[99:26.60]Outback's profile has suffered considerably after being defeated so easily.
[99:29.35]Alright, there was a lot of people in the attendance.
[99:35.93]Oh, what?
[99:36.43]I'm just bleeding money.
[99:38.49]Where is this $100 of expenses coming from?
[99:40.33]Anybody know?
[99:43.09]It's the training.
[99:50.84]All-American wrestling product has come under criticism in recent weeks, with ratings down to 85%.
[99:56.00]A new women's champion, Nirvana's defeated Comic Connie.
[100:03.15]Oh.
[100:04.87]Irma, aren't you tired of pouring your energy into working out for such small gains?
[100:12.01]For just $120, I could hook you up with some steroids.
[100:14.78]That would give you big results.
[100:17.54]Fast.
[100:17.76]Fast.
[100:23.00]Um... Do I get... Do I get caught?
[100:32.31]You'll feel the results in no time.
[100:37.73]Holy shit, it worked.
[100:39.42]Four-man elimination versus multiple opponents in this one.
[100:51.80]Needles.
[101:08.01]I love how they just put tables out there even when it's not a hardcore match.
[101:13.29]Driver 88.
[101:14.11]You did steroids and you're versus needles.
[101:27.22]Yeah.
[101:29.76]Are we all in the ring at the same time?
[101:40.68]How long can my entrance be?
[101:42.78]This is stupid
[102:08.04]Can I go into the audience?
[102:10.22]I'm like signing autographs.
[102:16.19]Alright, I'm in.
[102:19.19]Oh, you want to give me the finger?
[102:36.98]And the final contestant is Whack Axe with Matt Dickey.
[102:44.85]Wait, the dev is here?
[102:47.55]This guy must be a big deal.
[102:48.69]The dev is literally this guy's manager.
[102:56.89]Who should I focus on?
[102:59.07]Whack Axe, you've only remained the world champion this long by ducking me.
[103:06.79]Everybody knows that I'm the biggest threat to that little title.
[103:09.33]My mouth!
[103:12.42]Ow!
[103:12.62]My face!
[103:19.36]Now I'll show you why you have a right to fear me!
[103:26.81]Okay.
[103:30.03]My manager is always just in here.
[103:32.81]Alright, so this is the... Why do I... Alright, here's the play.
[103:36.13]The play is to get out of the... Just run away and have these guys fight each other and kill each other.
[103:40.72]And I come in as like the scavenger, as the vulture.
[103:45.24]Just pin the last suspecting person.
[103:51.44]Oops.
[103:55.62]Watch that, watch that, watch that.
[103:56.76]Alright, I'm going to focus on... Why don't we all just gang up on Whack-Ax?
[104:00.64]He's the champion.
[104:04.05]It's just carnage over there.
[104:05.03]What if I take the belt?
[104:06.94]I'm gonna grab the belt and just, like, leave.
[104:08.28]I got it!
[104:13.40]Alright, fine.
[104:15.22]I'll put it down.
[104:16.28]I gotta focus on this guy.
[104:19.18]Oh my god.
[104:36.06]How is anybody supposed to get pinned in this?
[104:37.46]Oh, right in the face.
[104:43.24]I have to wait till they get to my level.
[104:49.80]I'm going to do what I used to do in No Mercy.
[104:52.16]Just stand in the corner and taunt until I have a special and use my special on the lowest guy.
[104:57.70]This taunt builds your special if it works like No Mercy.
[105:01.60]It does, very briefly.
[105:03.04]And they're getting pissed that I'm doing that.
[105:04.20]Alright, this guy right here.
[105:15.03]Get out of here, M. Dicky!
[105:17.87]I have such a low health.
[105:23.46]It's not even funny.
[105:28.26]Distracted by the chair.
[105:29.30]Idiot.
[105:41.29]You know what?
[105:41.75]Get...
[105:43.65]Alright, come on in.
[105:44.13]Get in, get in, get in.
[105:44.71]He's not paying attention.
[105:45.35]Alright, do something stupid.
[105:47.65]Hurt him.
[105:51.27]How did I let him do that?
[105:52.39]I tried to grab him and he grabbed me by the head.
[105:54.03]It's because I'm so weak.
[105:55.67]I even did steroids before this match.
[105:57.19]It didn't even matter.
[106:01.72]I did steroids an hour ago.
[106:03.28]There we go.
[106:08.34]Nice.
[106:10.44]Black Axe.
[106:13.44]Boston crab this motherfucker right now.
[106:18.71]You two fight each other.
[106:22.59]I pinned him.
[106:24.87]No, I eliminated him.
[106:25.97]What?
[106:26.87]What's happening right now?
[106:28.06]Why is he like... Like, he's out.
[106:36.46]He's eliminated.
[106:37.24]Get him out of here.
[106:42.59]I just... I eliminated his ass.
[106:44.24]Get him out.
[106:44.64]Oh, come on.
[106:53.78]Alright.
[106:54.62]Don't get eliminated.
[106:56.98]Run away.
[106:57.63]Run away.
[106:57.93]Let them fight.
[107:02.55]Grab him from behind.
[107:03.69]There we go.
[107:06.43]Nice.
[107:06.65]Alright.
[107:07.03]Don't pay attention to me.
[107:08.97]You focus on each other.
[107:21.34]Good.
[107:24.13]I'm just a person in the audience.
[107:25.17]Don't mind me.
[107:39.28]I'm going to get a special and I'm going to use it.
[107:41.84]Ah!
[107:42.26]Ah!
[107:53.85]Does this make me more popular if I play to the crowd?
[107:57.55]Holy shit.
[108:05.22]Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak out, sneak out, sneak out, sneak out.
[108:13.06]Oh shit, I'm trying to run away.
[108:19.04]Come on, get away.
[108:26.07]Now I'm getting just double teamed.
[108:27.90]This is bad.
[108:30.30]He was holding my arms back.
[108:32.76]Why is he taking his chair?
[108:36.94]He just... My coach just literally took the chair that the commentator was sitting on.
[108:44.33]Why?
[108:45.79]What's wrong with you?
[108:51.61]The commentator is now coming into the ring.
[109:02.52]Like, what are you doing out here?
[109:05.84]Who is this?
[109:09.75]Tony Land.
[109:10.65]Alright, I'm gonna stun this guy.
[109:19.96]No!
[109:21.28]Reverse it, please!
[109:25.94]That's fine, pin him.
[109:27.48]I could care less.
[109:34.74]That took me so long to get up.
[109:42.61]That's fine.
[109:43.31]Kick his ass.
[109:45.51]What is he doing?
[109:48.41]Okay, that guy just got fired and he just doesn't care.
[109:50.93]Check this out.
[109:53.82]Stunner!
[110:07.91]No longer the champion.
[110:08.65]He's gone.
[110:08.93]Uh-oh.
[110:24.31]There's no ref.
[110:24.93]I'm fine.
[110:25.55]I hope he fights the commentator.
[110:34.15]I don't know what the ref is doing.
[110:35.01]I have no idea.
[110:36.27]Thank God.
[110:36.79]Coach... What's his name?
[110:37.75]Coach Emerson?
[110:47.33]I think this is gonna be a win.
[110:48.32]Am I gonna be the champion after this?
[110:50.40]Referee's not looking.
[110:52.68]Referee's not paying attention.
[110:55.98]Oh shit.
[111:05.63]Test his strength.
[111:06.13]Let's go.
[111:07.17]Oh, he's so much stronger than me.
[111:12.39]No!
[111:13.31]I'm so much weaker than him.
[111:21.12]What the fuck?
[111:25.02]Get up!
[111:26.34]Get up!
[111:31.54]Let go of me.
[111:32.48]Fuck.
[111:38.52]Nope.
[111:38.98]Not gonna happen.
[111:49.82]Quickly gets up.
[111:50.50]Oh my god.
[111:51.79]There it is.
[111:53.65]Going top rope.
[111:59.11]Oh my god!
[112:00.03]Oh no!
[112:08.30]Ugh, that sucked.
[112:15.12]Don't let him knock you down.
[112:16.02]Good.
[112:22.65]Good.
[112:24.91]Alright, I'm going for a submission.
[112:27.77]Again.
[112:30.09]He's done.
[112:30.35]He's done.
[112:37.11]Coach, don't screw this up for me.
[112:39.10]This is really close.
[112:42.68]I don't know what just happened there, but apparently not something good.
[112:46.00]Get up.
[112:48.50]I'm so dazed right now.
[112:49.56]I'm just going to hang out out here until I get my breath.
[112:57.24]Am I alright?
[112:57.62]I think I'm okay.
[113:00.73]I'm going back in.
[113:06.05]Whatever.
[113:06.33]I don't care if I hit the ref.
[113:12.40]Did I just hurt my own shoulder?
[113:13.72]Oh, fuck you.
[113:14.60]No way.
[113:16.32]Get off me.
[113:16.96]Reverse it.
[113:17.34]Reverse it.
[113:17.70]Reverse it.
[113:18.02]Reverse it.
[113:18.34]Reverse it.
[113:18.72]Rope break.
[113:25.22]I'm so slow to get up.
[113:27.12]I'm so weak.
[113:28.52]Oh no.
[113:35.83]Breather, take a breather, take a breather, take a breather.
[113:39.53]Alright, I'm fine.
[113:44.58]That was huge.
[113:46.14]I just gotta get up, take a breather still.
[113:58.19]I grabbed him and he didn't move to me.
[114:00.89]Oh, that's bad.
[114:05.47]Just stay near the ropes and I'll be fine.
[114:15.00]Did he help me?
[114:16.26]Is he helping me or hurting me?
[114:17.76]Was that a hindrance?
[114:20.76]I'm so weak.
[114:26.60]I can barely stand up.
[114:27.75]I'm just going to have to use body weight.
[114:32.37]Hit him.
[114:34.70]Oh, come on, dude.
[114:36.04]Again.
[114:37.00]What?
[114:38.50]I was going to say, no way.
[114:43.78]Reverse it.
[114:44.83]Reverse it, please.
[114:46.85]Reverse it.
[114:47.33]He's holding me for way too long.
[114:50.21]Ow.
[114:55.45]Come on.
[114:56.59]What's that guy's name?
[114:57.77]Schmoe?
[115:04.80]Oh, you're fucked now.
[115:07.68]What the hell did I let go for?
[115:13.73]Come on, get in here.
[115:15.15]Get in here!
[115:23.57]Oh god, he elbowed me and I fell down.
[115:25.32]I don't think I'm gonna win this match.
[115:26.96]I think it's over.
[115:32.24]Nope, he's down too.
[115:35.66]I gotta run out.
[115:36.12]I gotta escape.
[115:37.56]It's so close.
[115:38.20]I know.
[115:38.53]I gotta run away for a minute.
[115:40.63]Take a breather.
[115:47.79]Good.
[115:48.29]The bait worked.
[115:53.25]Holy shit.
[115:53.93]I actually just fooled him.
[115:58.26]Damn it.
[115:58.62]I missed.
[115:58.94]Ugh!
[116:07.37]Come on!
[116:08.07]Hurt him!
[116:08.45]That's it!
[116:11.03]No, it's not.
[116:14.21]Look at how much slower I am to get up.
[116:15.53]I'm trying to get up so fast.
[116:22.11]Come here, you piece of shit!
[116:26.09]No!
[116:28.39]No!
[116:28.97]Fight it!
[116:29.67]Don't let him beat you!
[116:31.37]No!
[116:31.77]He's got me even worse!
[116:35.56]Oh no!
[116:35.84]This is horrible!
[116:37.30]This is horrible!
[116:38.88]I'm passed out right now!
[116:40.48]I'm dead!
[116:41.06]I'm not even... I'm not responsive!
[116:46.04]Good!
[116:55.87]I can't do this!
[117:02.33]FED UP!
[117:10.42]Shit!
[117:15.12]Come on, get up!
[117:18.10]Get up, please!
[117:21.75]You're doing such a good job distracting for me.
[117:24.73]Oh my god.
[117:25.97]No, I'm not getting up.
[117:27.09]It's over.
[117:27.57]I'm at zero.
[117:29.17]I'm actually at zero health.
[117:33.24]I have to slide out of the ring.
[117:34.66]If I have any chance.
[117:37.38]Get up.
[117:37.70]Come on.
[117:40.72]Coward move.
[117:41.30]Out.
[117:42.00]Roll out.
[117:46.72]Oh my fucking god.
[117:48.21]Why did I do that?
[117:50.95]Come on, coach.
[117:54.83]Coach, you're really getting in the way, man.
[118:06.03]I didn't mean to!
[118:11.57]That's it!
[118:12.29]That's it, Phantom!
[118:13.71]One!
[118:14.69]Two!
[118:16.17]Yes!
[118:22.72]Get outta here!
[118:25.02]Oh, that was insane.
[118:26.18]I can't believe it.
[118:30.58]Whackaxe appears to have been sustained by adrenaline in that match and is suffering from exhaustion now that it's over.
[118:37.18]Okay.
[118:41.14]Jerma's profile has improved considerably by winning at a major event.
[118:46.64]Driver88's strength has risen to 76% after participating in that match.
[118:51.40]Needles has damaged the reputation of Wrestling Revolution by failing to win that inter-promotional contest.
[118:57.69]Will I not get any money?
[119:05.37]I have to get signed.
[119:06.46]Alright, come on.
[119:08.26]Sign me.
[119:08.50]I've got a match coming up that I'm not sure I can win on my own.
[119:11.70]Okay.
[119:13.96]Okay.
[119:16.67]Would you consider assisting me at the ringside?
[119:18.55]There's $60 in it for you if you do.
[119:20.91]$60, man.
[119:21.33]Let's go.
[119:21.63]Sure.
[119:27.53]I was going to come out and protect him.
[119:35.39]I paid $130 for mine.
[119:36.08]I'll just make sure that he doesn't lose.
[119:40.08]We've got Matt Black with Jerma.
[119:52.93]I can't get in the ring, right?
[119:53.81]Can I get in the ring?
[120:01.30]I can't get out.
[120:07.16]And then Burlane with Matt Dickey.
[120:09.02]Uh-oh, it's manager versus manager time.
[120:23.40]Do I get in?
[120:27.89]I think I just punched him.
[120:29.33]Do I have to get out?
[120:33.07]So, okay, the guy with the bald head.
[120:34.93]Wait, there's two guys with bald heads.
[120:35.97]Where am I?
[120:37.69]Wait, what's wrong with my character?
[120:41.51]Matt Dickey, I think, I didn't press any buttons.
[120:43.69]I'm pretty sure Matt Dickey just fell off the ring.
[120:46.41]I did not press any buttons.
[120:47.33]I don't even know where I am.
[120:51.56]Where the fuck am I?
[120:55.18]Where am I?
[120:55.86]I can't see myself.
[121:01.11]This is their match.
[121:02.15]Yeah, I gotta make sure he wins.
[121:09.92]Where the fuck am I?
[121:12.08]Are we under the ring?
[121:20.00]Where are we fighting?
[121:31.40]Okay.
[121:41.52]Holy shit, this is awesome.
[121:44.81]Where are we?
[121:49.95]Where the fuck did we go?
[121:51.11]Oh my god, that was cool from here.
[121:57.79]Alright, where are we?
[122:00.13]Oh shit, there I am.
[122:13.22]My stomach!
[122:16.62]I'm here!
[122:17.10]I made it!
[122:17.52]I can't!
[122:23.46]I can't!
[122:28.61]Okay, let's change the camera back to normal.
[122:33.79]What was it called?
[122:34.31]Hard camera?
[122:35.97]What was it?
[122:36.33]Like... 70?
[122:37.71]80%?
[122:37.75]60?
[122:37.77]How much percent zoom was it?
[122:43.09]I don't even know what... I have no idea what the actual camera was.
[122:45.43]Alright, I'm coming in.
[122:54.91]How do I go in?
[122:57.62]I think I fell down again.
[122:59.10]Where's Matt Dickey?
[123:12.39]Oh shit, look it, he's almost dead.
[123:13.81]Hey, can I throw a weapon in the ring and hit him?
[123:17.71]Well, what do I care if I get disqualified?
[123:19.11]That doesn't matter, right?
[123:25.74]Does that matter if I get disqualified?
[123:27.10]Did I hit the ref?
[123:40.00]Come on, I got you.
[123:41.94]Oops.
[123:49.88]I picked up the stairs?
[123:52.67]Here, I'll pass it to you.
[124:05.56]Right on the chair.
[124:06.40]And that was legal because he didn't do anything.
[124:08.06]Hit him.
[124:10.30]Let's go.
[124:10.62]Hit him.
[124:20.81]Hey, get down.
[124:21.49]Get down.
[124:22.63]Get him down.
[124:24.39]Get him down.
[124:27.01]See, I'm not in there.
[124:28.17]This is not illegal for me.
[124:29.02]Alright, fuck it.
[124:30.42]I'm going in.
[124:39.02]Shit!
[124:39.88]Get in!
[124:40.30]Fuck!
[124:56.43]Oh my god, he landed on top of me!
[124:58.23]Put that down, put that down!
[125:02.81]Good, good, good, good.
[125:03.49]Alright, let's kick his ass.
[125:08.01]Ow!
[125:12.53]Alright, this guy's really injured.
[125:13.83]Alright, I got him.
[125:18.80]Get in the ring.
[125:21.46]Get in the ring.
[125:21.92]Get in the ring.
[125:22.26]You're fine.
[125:23.70]Put the bat down and get in the ring.
[125:25.18]I got it.
[125:25.66]I got this.
[125:26.06]Why is this guy on permanent two count?
[125:38.90]Change it to scope?
[125:43.76]Oh, scope.
[125:45.74]Player only?
[125:46.56]Relevant to player?
[125:50.65]Is this relevant to player or contain all?
[125:54.43]Which one should I do?
[125:56.59]Player only, right?
[125:57.23]I don't think that matters.
[126:05.40]Why am I tired?
[126:08.72]Count them out!
[126:13.30]Um, I have no idea where M. Dicky is, but he's, like, I think he's on the ground somewhere.
[126:22.04]Don't get yourself counted out.
[126:22.94]Let him get counted out.
[126:28.52]You idiot!
[126:32.17]Come here!
[126:40.01]I gotta go find M. Dicky.
[126:45.46]Alright, camera.
[126:47.47]Bird's eye third person.
[126:49.85]The third person contain all?
[126:52.99]No, that's only covering these guys.
[127:05.44]Oh, he's on the rope.
[127:06.88]Spinning around.
[127:21.10]I'm trying to grab the ref.
[127:24.85]That's like a superhero jump.
[127:28.15]Alright, pin him.
[127:36.04]Oh, there's M. Dicky.
[127:39.66]What are you doing?
[127:42.46]Why would you just do that?
[127:43.94]That's a rope break.
[127:44.58]Alright, get him down here.
[127:48.56]This camera... Fuck.
[127:49.76]Contain all.
[127:50.29]There we go.
[128:08.51]What do you guys think about the match so far?
[128:25.94]Who's getting counted out?
[128:27.24]I don't know who's getting counted out.
[128:29.29]I think it's this guy.
[128:31.05]Are we about to win?
[128:36.13]What's happening?
[128:38.94]Count him out!
[128:39.52]Yeah!
[128:42.36]I don't know why you were refereeing this match.
[128:43.96]Outlaw Eaton, because you're obviously not qualified.
[128:49.47]I can't play this game!
[128:51.41]I'm gonna do that every 10 seconds!
[128:54.77]It's the biggest mistake of your life!
[128:56.49]I have to relax.
[129:02.74]Every time I see something stupid, I just, like, all the air leaves my body.
[129:07.72]Ugh.
[129:14.13]This is not the game to play.
[129:15.29]I have to pull out a muscle in my neck.
[129:19.97]God damn it, man.
[129:20.95]Alright, I gotta settle down.
[129:24.01]Relaying his damage to the reputation of Wrestling Revolution by failing to win.
[129:27.02]Matt Black's profile has improved.
[129:29.88]Okay.
[129:30.20]Matt Dickey is disappointed that his client lost that match.
[129:37.34]Oh my goodness.
[129:42.48]People paid money to watch that match?
[129:44.40]Yeah.
[129:47.00]I think that's worth like five times what the WWE pay-per-views are.
[129:52.52]That was insane.
[129:55.86]Dangal has developed a friendship with Buddy Brew.
[129:58.26]Oh wait, this is Matt Black.
[130:01.54]Bully Demise walks around like he owns this place and has been making our lives miserable.
[130:08.66]Do you think you could teach him a lesson?
[130:09.96]There's $80 in it for you if you do.
[130:13.17]Teach him a lesson.
[130:16.15]Um... Why am I... This guy's lackey.
[130:24.93]I don't think I can do... Alright, I'll deal with bully demise.
[130:27.41]Do I... Can I bring a weapon?
[130:33.27]I don't have any... I can't.
[130:34.41]I don't have any health.
[130:37.31]I need a week of rest.
[130:39.81]You're not part of the solution.
[130:40.65]You're part of the problem, Jerma.
[130:43.77]No.
[130:46.45]What the fuck?
[130:47.41]Alright.
[130:49.63]This is, I think, big match coming up here.
[130:51.06]What am I doing?
[130:52.04]75, 76, 72.
[130:52.26]60.
[130:52.32]Alright.
[130:52.60]Sumo contest.
[130:53.62]What does that mean?
[131:13.20]Tommy Hawk.
[131:17.58]Oh, by the way, for those of you that are curious, I recognize this name because I think I went into the editor just to check and see what it was like, and I think I changed his hair.
[131:25.23]I don't think he looks like this, like the default character.
[131:33.20]What does Sumo match?
[131:50.78]Alright, for a second, I thought that was Tony the Tiger.
[131:57.12]I don't understand what a sumo match means.
[132:03.38]Just throw him over the ropes?
[132:05.94]What are you doing, ref?
[132:07.06]What's wrong with you?
[132:11.99]Don't leave the ring.
[132:13.29]Okay.
[132:14.71]Five minutes?
[132:20.67]This guy is like seven or eight.
[132:22.58]The guy's like two feet taller than me.
[132:25.00]Lance Monaco is coming in.
[132:27.40]For who?
[132:28.20]Me?
[132:29.84]No, this guy's a dick.
[132:30.76]This guy, I don't.
[132:38.52]Get him out of here.
[132:39.88]Did I just lose?
[132:52.08]Come on.
[132:53.12]What?
[132:55.92]What the fuck?
[132:59.44]I- Why did that guy interfere?
[133:00.94]That's not fair.
[133:01.64]Tommy Hawk's profile has improved considerably by having a guy interfere, walk in the ring, and then I bounce off of his body and fly over the ropes.
[133:15.71]Oh, he generated buzz.
[133:17.07]Lance Monaco is so popular.
[133:18.41]What the hell?
[133:26.43]The doper is complaining about cheating.
[133:29.73]Running short of staff tonight, Jerma.
[133:31.17]Could you sit in on commentary for the next match?
[133:35.15]Oh, hell yeah.
[133:37.43]Yes.
[133:38.18]Oh, absolutely.
[133:39.08]I will work as a commentator.
[133:42.36]This is awesome.
[133:43.14]Thanks, Jerma.
[133:43.50]You just saved the broadcast.
[133:44.76]Please accept $60 for your time.
[133:50.39]What do I do?
[133:51.81]It's another sumo contest.
[133:55.78]John Crockett.
[134:08.31]That's John Crockett versus Inosumo.
[134:10.45]I thought he just eliminated himself.
[134:14.19]Versus Wurikusen.
[134:16.77]With Coach Emerson.
[134:18.99]Okay, same rules.
[134:19.61]If you go over the top rope, you're out.
[134:23.88]Very cool.
[134:29.06]So, I am sitting over there.
[134:30.80]Do I have to... What do I have to do?
[134:33.54]I'm just the commentator?
[134:35.52]Jerma will be joining us on commentary to share his insights in this match.
[134:40.64]This is awesome.
[134:42.96]You know what it takes to win, so how long do you see this match going?
[134:47.82]Huh.
[134:50.48]It will go longer than five minutes.
[134:51.82]It will take less than five minutes.
[134:53.06]If it's a sumo competition, someone's going over very quickly.
[134:56.60]It'll take less than five minutes.
[134:59.24]You heard it here first, Jerma thinks this match will be over soon, so let's find out.
[135:02.43]Okay.
[135:11.37]What's this camera?
[135:14.79]Wait, what am I- What the fuck?!
[135:23.09]What is happening?!
[135:24.51]What is happening?!
[135:25.63]Why did I- I didn't mean to climb?! !
[135:32.23]What, do I still have to do commentary?
[135:33.78]No, get off!
[135:35.94]Get off!
[135:36.72]Get off, get off.
[135:37.26]Sit back in the chair.
[135:40.88]I got it right!
[135:41.56]It's over!
[135:42.00]I got it right, see?
[135:43.93]The real winner tonight is you, Jerma.
[135:45.79]You predicted this match would be quick.
[135:51.99]That's right.
[136:06.65]This okay, I'm telling you right now.
[136:09.91]I'm gonna make this very clear This is some of the this is a very this is some of the most fun.

[136:26.80]This is fucking fantastic
[136:32.07]Alright, that match was 35 seconds long.
[136:34.46]Alright, their profile suffered considerably after incurring a loss at a major event.
[136:41.84]John Crockett's profile has improved.
[136:45.12]That was so fast.
[136:46.16]Coach Emerson is disappointed that his client lost that match.
[136:55.57]Schmoke's status is being compromised by the limitations of wrestling school.
[137:01.12]Kylie Barrier's profile has dropped considerably after being criticized by the press.
[137:06.57]What's coming up next?
[137:08.01]Something on TV?
[137:09.93]I have actually full health this time, thankfully.
[137:14.65]Okay, what do we got next?
[137:15.75]Last Man Standing versus David Highbrow.
[137:18.40]Alright, let's make this one quick.
[137:37.24]You're going to get signed soon?
[137:38.51]I hope so.
[137:38.93]Versus Jerma.
[137:55.50]What are the rules?
[137:56.02]Last man standing.
[137:58.36]Jerma, I'm sure you think winning a fight involves being on top for three precious seconds.
[138:06.07]Well, when you win a real fight, the loser doesn't get up ever again.
[138:10.89]To kill each other?
[138:13.61]You're about to find that out when only one of us walks out of here in one piece.
[138:18.18]Cherry, I'm in the face, please.
[138:21.74]Actually, the three counters there protect my victims.
[138:24.60]But there'll be no mercy for you now.
[138:29.44]Are there no rules?
[138:30.04]Why does she have the cherry?
[138:34.24]Are there no rules?
[138:37.93]Alright, there are obviously no rules.
[138:39.69]Obviously no rules.
[138:41.01]Going to get weapons.
[138:59.85]Oh my god!
[139:07.75]Brutal.
[139:11.65]Oh!
[139:12.59]I gotta get the table in here.

[140:22.19]Give me the shit.
[140:28.36]Ow!
[140:30.90]Bring the table into the ring?
[140:36.67]Who does a submission move in, like, a weapons match?
[140:43.95]Quest it.
[140:47.17]I think the ref just bit her lip.
[140:51.56]Oh my god, he caught me.
[140:55.46]Why is she care- Excuse me.
[141:00.26]Fight it!
[141:00.62]There we go.
[141:06.49]Break his neck.
[141:11.23]The goal is to get the table in the ring, get him on the table, and to do a backflip on him through the table.
[141:16.01]I think I just really hurt him.
[141:25.06]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[141:54.89]What's the count for?
[141:57.17]Wait, what's going on?
[142:04.74]Alright, can I put him in the chair?
[142:05.58]Alright, I'm going to put him through the chair.
[142:17.51]He has to stay on the ground for 10 seconds.
[142:19.05]Oh, okay, I get it.
[142:24.82]Fight it!
[142:32.96]He just punched me in the balls.
[142:33.77]Alright, yeah, whatever.
[142:34.79]Last man standing.
[142:35.85]Fine.
[142:36.53]And you're gonna go there?
[142:37.63]Oh, there's an announcer's table over there.
[142:54.30]Oh, you're down.
[142:55.29]See you later.
[142:57.31]I'm not gonna let him get up.
[143:09.52]Stop the match!
[143:10.50]Stay down.
[143:33.29]This guy's... This is horrible.
[143:55.62]He was baiting me.
[143:56.69]Did you see that?
[143:57.93]That was a fake.
[144:03.13]I'm going to get the other.
[144:03.73]I'm getting the announcer's table and putting it in here.
[144:12.88]No, I don't.
[144:13.52]Give me.
[144:13.94]Is he down?
[144:14.60]Did I win?
[144:16.97]I won!
[144:25.52]I killed him.
[144:26.70]I win.
[144:26.94]Nermous profile has improved considerably.
[144:29.94]Nice.
[144:33.94]Alright, 78 attitude.
[144:36.40]David Highbrow is way down.
[144:42.18]I need to get signed by an actual company so I stop bleeding money.
[144:51.17]While Eaton and Al Cobain have defeated Midwinter and Monica Marquez to become the new tag team champions.
[144:57.88]The Ball has defeated Lestat Macabre.
[145:01.60]I want to be a champion.
[145:06.74]Alright, this is it.
[145:08.37]I've been keeping an eye on your progress and think some changes need to be made.
[145:10.89]I need an agency, right?
[145:15.73]You're not talented enough to give fans the technical wrestling that they pay to see.
[145:20.32]What?
[145:23.55]Get your skill up to 79% by the second week of October, or you'll have to find a different line of work.
[145:30.25]What?
[145:31.83]Oh god, what's going on?
[145:33.41]Jeremiah, aren't you tired of pouring your energy into working out for such small gains?
[145:40.52]For just $120, I could hook you up with some steroids.
[145:42.86]That'll give you big results immediately.
[145:46.24]Immediately after hearing that, went to the drug dealer.
[145:55.12]Okay.
[145:56.48]What are my stats?
[145:57.48]79%, right?
[145:58.78]My skill is 80.
[145:59.38]I'm good.
[146:00.04]We're good.
[146:02.02]Alright, this is a regular match.
[146:30.32]I think I have a club.
[146:32.40]Oh no, Tommy Hawk.
[146:36.40]I got a rivalry with this guy.
[146:44.03]This is just a singles match.
[146:45.07]Alright, I have to beat this guy.
[146:47.17]I gotta just do technical wrestling, beat him, actually play by the rules, and just win.
[146:55.99]Lock the medicine cabinet, Jerma is on the prowl looking for his next fix.
[147:01.10]That's unconfirmed!
[147:02.99]Cat's out of the bag and now everybody knows you're a filthy drug addict.
[147:07.37]That hasn't been confirmed.
[147:09.95]You brought shame on this sport and everybody who has tried to keep it clean.
[147:17.60]If you're so sure about that, why don't you give us a urine sample, Tommy Hawk?
[147:25.53]After I beat the piss out of you, the whole world will get to see who you really are.
[147:29.18]I have to win this, otherwise I have to do a drug test.
[147:32.00]I think that's what this is implying.
[147:45.13]Start.
[147:52.25]Good start.
[147:54.44]Alright, I gotta focus here.
[148:00.92]Focus, focus.
[148:03.74]I don't know what just happened.
[148:05.00]Thank you, ref, just help me.
[148:09.61]Accidentally.
[148:17.33]I have to do really light moves on this guy because I can't lift him.
[148:20.30]I really don't think I can lift him up.
[148:28.53]Nice.
[148:29.15]Holy shit.
[148:29.91]What a perfect event.
[148:31.11]That was unbelievable.
[148:33.25]I almost had my special.
[148:41.62]Couple more of those and I'm going to put him up.
[148:48.28]Good.
[148:48.86]Good.
[148:49.04]Do it.
[148:49.30]Use it.
[148:53.84]Idiot.
[148:58.80]Oh, the fucking reversal.
[149:00.32]The double reversal.
[149:07.41]Shit.
[149:08.45]Test of strength.
[149:10.25]I really am on steroids.
[149:16.05]Come on, this is it.
[149:16.87]This is where I can end it.
[149:17.77]I can end it right here if I get an adrenaline rush here.
[149:20.25]I got it.
[149:20.71]It's over.
[149:21.25]Stunner.
[149:22.25]Good night.
[149:26.08]Pick him up and do it again, quick.
[149:32.31]Goodnight.
[149:33.03]That's it.
[149:33.29]Nice try.
[149:42.50]Don't get too cocky.
[149:51.38]If he wants to leave, let him leave.
[149:55.26]How did I miss that?
[149:59.40]How did I miss that?
[150:02.37]How the fuck did I miss that?
[150:03.51]I went right through him.
[150:04.27]What the fuck?
[150:11.31]He's hurt.
[150:12.77]He's actually hurt.
[150:17.43]Holding his side pretty hard.
[150:18.51]If I didn't start with 50% health, god damn it.
[150:22.67]Alright, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[150:23.41]Just relax.
[150:28.84]Actually, exactly where I want to be.
[150:30.04]Go out.
[150:33.48]Take the time to gain some strength here.
[150:35.10]Relax.
[150:35.50]Alright, bring it back.
[150:51.36]Step on his head.
[150:57.04]Don't let him grab me.
[150:57.89]That's all I need to know.
[151:00.65]Watch out.
[151:01.11]Do some dodging.
[151:07.95]Ref, that was an eye rake, if I've ever seen one.
[151:16.49]Oh, get out of here.
[151:20.65]Here we go.
[151:21.89]And... Shit!
[151:29.83]Move.
[151:32.61]Consume his fist to gain power.
[151:36.74]No!
[151:41.65]Just run away, run away.
[151:42.43]I slowly am whittling him down to my level.
[151:48.09]That was a really good move.
[151:53.37]Oh, come on.
[151:54.15]Break that rope, please.
[152:01.42]Again, rope break.
[152:07.06]Oops.
[152:07.98]Well, it worked out in my favor.
[152:09.20]It's okay.
[152:18.39]Watch that return.
[152:19.19]I don't want him to kick me.
[152:25.76]Alright, come on.
[152:26.56]He's getting low.
[152:27.54]Oh, fuck!
[152:32.54]What?!
[152:33.89]Oh my god, that cheap little bullshit!
[152:51.27]Oh, I'm so... Good.
[152:52.45]Use it!
[152:52.79]Use it!
[152:53.13]Use it on me!
[152:53.67]Use it on me!
[152:54.17]Use it on me!
[152:54.69]Use it on me!
[153:00.20]Ah!
[153:01.46]Oh, god damn it.
[153:04.78]Get him with a submission.
[153:05.98]I gotta get him on the ground.
[153:11.74]Let's go.
[153:14.10]Got it.
[153:15.78]Got it!
[153:25.32]Again, on his head.
[153:30.14]Break the arm!
[153:31.98]Break the arm!
[153:32.78]Twist it!
[153:35.55]Come on, hurt him!
[153:38.19]I don't want to get a drug test!
[153:40.31]Do it!
[153:41.85]Do it!
[153:45.49]I don't want to take a drug test!
[153:49.61]Twist it!
[153:52.95]Come on!
[153:55.71]No!
[153:57.53]Oh, he's so close.
[153:59.70]I'm the referee's crotch.
[154:03.72]Tap out.
[154:06.78]That's it.
[154:08.36]Yeah.
[154:17.59]Tommy Hawk's skill has risen to 66%.
[154:24.02]The ref was just listening to that?
[154:26.48]Alright, more stamina.
[154:33.64]Imagine being the ref and hearing that.
[154:37.61]What the fuck am I listening to?
[154:39.55]I don't want to take a drug test!
[154:41.49]No!
[154:42.15]I have to win!
[154:42.95]Tap out!
[154:43.49]I don't want to take a drug test!
[154:47.29]Birdboy has left All-American Wrestling to pursue a career at Super Lucha Libre.
[154:52.31]Jerma appears to have gained weight.
[154:54.37]The 35-year-old now weighs 200... 200... 247 pounds?
[155:10.00]My skill went down.
[155:11.16]Jerma has been challenged to increase his skill to 79% by the second week of October.
[155:18.52]Oh my god.
[155:19.32]How do I lose weight?
[155:23.28]I can go train?
[155:31.02]Oh, my health is so low.
[155:32.32]Alright, how do I, like, throw a match?
[155:35.68]Tables and chairs match versus Tommy Hawk.
[155:37.78]I just beat this guy's ass.
[155:42.50]Oh, God.
[155:45.68]You gained 80 pounds.
[155:49.48]Tables and ladders and chairs match versus this guy?
[155:52.48]I'm actually really happy about that.
[155:55.54]Because that means I have no health, but neither should he.
[155:58.35]He just tapped out at zero health.
[156:08.55]Going right for the table already.
[156:11.47]Okay.
[156:11.59]Alright.
[156:16.90]Alright.
[156:23.73]Can't believe I gained almost 100 pounds.
[156:32.82]Taking the announcer's table.
[156:44.07]We're all holding chairs.
[156:45.71]Wrestling is a business more than anything else, so it doesn't really matter who wins or loses.
[156:52.79]For instance, if you were to pay me $160, I could make sure this match goes your way.
[157:05.20]Sure, I'll pay you $160.
[157:06.30]It's a pleasure doing business with you.
[157:09.14]I'll do everything in my power to make sure you win.
[157:16.91]Okay.
[157:19.21]Do you think we probably should have did that backstage before we got on the ring?
[157:35.85]Wait, what?
[157:38.83]Oh my god!
[157:42.75]Make sure I win!
[157:46.64]I gotta put him through that huge thing over there, right?
[157:48.66]Alright, get over here.
[157:53.96]Shit, no.
[157:54.56]I wanted to put him through it.
[158:07.26]Give me that.
[158:07.52]Give me that.
[158:07.78]I don't know.
[158:08.04]I don't care what it is.
[158:17.41]Oh my god.
[158:18.39]These eyes made him fucking weird.
[158:20.37]I just fucked him up.
[158:29.79]Get on that table.
[158:32.73]Did I?
[158:33.09]Oh, wait.
[158:33.37]He broke it.
[158:40.28]He just blocked it.
[158:41.06]Are you kidding me?
[158:43.64]I want to get up on there.
[158:45.94]I need to get him up on here and we got to make... This has got to be... I got to do this.
[158:57.77]How do I get him up there?
[159:00.71]Will he come up here?
[159:01.43]Holy shit, I'm so high.
[159:06.53]Oh my god.
[159:10.89]Uh, dude, I paid you... I paid you almost $200, man.
[159:15.15]That's no way you're gonna do that.
[159:16.39]Oh, I hit him in the eye.
[159:37.92]Oh, fuck.
[159:39.38]Oh, fuck.
[159:45.42]Get- I need to get you up here.
[159:51.21]Oh shit!
[160:02.03]Gimme gimme gimme gimme.
[160:05.15]I want- I wonder how you place him on the table.
[160:11.04]Just gimme the chair and I'll be fine.
[160:16.96]Alright, whatever, whatever.
[160:17.72]It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[160:20.98]Just run.
[160:27.46]Don't let him... We're good.
[160:33.87]Thank you, ref.
[160:35.43]I need to do more tables and shit.
[160:42.77]Oh, goddammit.
[160:46.12]I love how the referee is just doing this.
[160:49.06]Do the safe play, just kill him.
[160:51.76]Nice catch, dude.
[161:04.23]In the head.
[161:05.55]Way more damage if it's in the head.
[161:14.39]Okay, give me that table.
[161:18.07]Watch out.
[161:18.33]Give it to me.
[161:18.93]Give it to me.
[161:19.63]Give me that table.
[161:20.19]Let it go.
[161:22.71]Let that shit go.
[161:28.05]Eat shit.
[161:28.51]Let's go.
[161:30.65]Oh my god.
[161:31.47]I just... He's done.
[161:34.64]Goodbye.
[161:35.28]He's dead.
[161:38.62]It was never any chance of you giving me a fair chance in this match.
[161:41.04]Out back.
[161:45.42]Oh, you up already.
[161:48.08]Next time you want to mess with me, you better be wearing your ring gear.
[161:52.72]That was sick.
[162:05.04]My profile improved considerably.
[162:10.17]Tommy Hawk's profile suffered.
[162:11.43]I got offered to wrestle for that organization and they never called me back.
[162:18.57]I've won like seven of my last eight matches in a row.
[162:23.79]I got it.
[162:26.39]Congratulations, Jerma.
[162:27.28]You followed my advice and made your prospects better than ever.
[162:31.52]I wish I could offer you a reward, but at this level experience is the only reward there is.
[162:35.90]Okay.
[162:39.70]I don't want to fight this guy again.
[162:44.47]Hardcore singles match?
[162:46.19]Do I have to do this again with Tommy Hawk?
[162:50.07]I just got paid in exposure.
[162:55.43]At what point does this guy leave me alone?
[163:00.94]Hardcore singles.
[163:02.06]Alright, I'm just going to get the chair and he's going to mic this time.
[163:09.24]There's dynamite over there.
[163:10.05]I'm just gonna throw it at him.
[163:15.91]This guy's my nemesis?
[163:16.87]Yeah, but just because somebody's your nemesis doesn't mean you face them in a match every day.
[163:22.62]No, actually, wait.
[163:43.58]Damn it.
[163:47.70]Give me the fucking mic.
[163:49.34]Let's go.
[163:49.76]Alright, what do you have to say?
[163:58.03]All week we've been polling fans on which match they would like to see and they voted for... Gerber versus Tommy Hawk in a hardcore match.
[164:10.99]And an arcade match.
[164:12.87]Who can get to a thousand points in Galaga first?
[164:18.78]I think I just got hit by the bell.
[164:20.48]He did.
[164:21.58]He hit me in the face.
[164:26.16]I'm 90% positive I'm on the ground right now.
[164:30.14]Ah, those rules suit me perfectly.
[164:38.02]So it seems these fans want to see you suffer.
[164:41.76]No, they just felt they had to do something this drastic to make one of your matches entertaining.
[164:55.26]Alright, I'm getting the ladder.
[164:59.96]Fuck it.
[165:04.52]I'm going right for the ladder.
[165:12.79]What's wrong with this ladder?
[165:16.45]Holy shit, you suck.
[165:21.80]Oh my god, get out of the way, ref, please!
[165:24.78]Ah!
[165:26.10]How did it hit me in the face?
[165:30.77]It bounced back and springboarded into my mouth.
[165:32.57]Great.
[165:33.01]Excellent.
[165:33.35]And now I'm, like, tired.
[165:49.59]You don't block a chair shot like that.
[165:51.13]You really don't.
[165:51.67]I got him.
[166:05.63]Why would I do this?
[166:08.55]Don't worry, this isn't an invasion so much as an exodus because I'm leaving Maple Leaf Grappling Federation!
[166:15.11]Oh, are you?
[166:16.29]Cool.
[166:28.31]I'm seeing stars.
[166:30.17]I'm not kidding.
[166:30.67]I have to slow down.
[166:31.27]This game is going to hurt me.
[166:34.09]I'm actually seeing stars right now.
[166:36.30]All the air just came out of my body again.
[166:38.42]I need to pause it.
[166:45.84]I promised I was going to settle down too and it just doesn't matter.
[166:53.69]That is just so stupid.
[166:54.63]Why?
[166:55.21]Why?
[166:55.47]This whole scenario is so dumb.
[167:01.95]the guy interrupts the match to tell us that he's changing his he's leaving this league to go to a different league get the fuck out of here like what do you do why are you here there's no reason for you to do that here this guy was so mad about it I'm I tried to jump I was on top of the ladder
[167:22.12]And I believe, I believe he pushed me off the ladder.
[167:26.32]Climbed on top of the ladder and was so annoyed with what this guy was saying.
[167:30.24]He jumped off the ladder into him.
[167:31.64]You know what I mean?
[167:32.26]Like, it's just, that whole scenario just, it just makes all the gas leave the body.
[167:36.64]You know what I mean?
[167:37.38]Like, what the fuck?
[167:41.60]I'm on the ground.
[167:47.43]Ugh.
[167:51.40]Okay.
[167:52.14]So, but who is this?
[167:54.55]I don't know.
[167:54.91]What's this guy's problem?
[167:56.35]Is he just... I can't even describe what's happening.
[167:59.81]This is ridiculous.
[168:00.65]Oh, shit.
[168:04.77]He's going to pin me.
[168:11.19]I keep going over that in my head over and over again.
[168:18.94]Please, can I have that back?
[168:22.55]Oh, this is the fight to who gets to play with the camera.
[168:33.39]Off the ladder.
[168:33.93]We're going to get some ladder action here.
[168:38.62]You want to come face me on the ladder?
[168:40.12]Can I hit him?
[168:54.45]Shit.
[168:54.69]Alright.
[168:55.33]I gotta get a chair or something.
[169:01.39]No, I gotta whip him into the... What are you doing?
[169:03.78]Get the fuck out of here.
[169:06.98]Why did this guy come in the ring?
[169:10.82]I'm hugging this guy.
[169:18.14]Whose belt is this?
[169:22.03]Whose belt is that?
[169:23.17]A championship belt?
[169:27.76]He's got the camera.
[169:36.34]Shit.
[169:37.01]He's videotaping it.
[169:39.53]This is how I felt when I was filming weddings.
[169:41.57]I used to film weddings, guys.
[169:43.65]And sometimes you just didn't know what the hell to film.
[169:45.99]Especially during the dance stuff.
[169:48.06]Somebody was always doing something weird.
[169:49.38]And it was like, oh fuck, do I record the drunk uncle guy doing a breakdance?
[169:53.80]Or should I go film the bride and groom kissing?
[169:56.51]It was incredibly difficult.
[170:09.72]I don't even know who I hit.
[170:10.62]I don't care.
[170:16.16]Is this a- this is a wait.
[170:17.46]Oh god.
[170:17.80]Alright, here we go.
[170:26.03]Who is this mustard guy?
[170:28.09]Why is he in the ring?
[170:31.29]Why is this guy in here?
[170:33.83]Why are you in here?
[170:34.91]Get out of here!
[170:35.99]Get the fuck out of the ring!
[170:37.17]I don't even- is this guy an audience member?
[170:55.50]I have to.
[170:56.34]Five minutes remaining.
[170:57.16]Alright, here's the plan.
[170:59.40]I'm going to knock him in the head with this and I'm going to go off the top turnbuckle and spin him.
[171:03.46]Okay, let's go.
[171:09.91]Big splash to end it.
[171:30.53]Come on.
[171:32.43]Why is Jordan of his teeth?
[171:33.85]What are you doing?
[171:34.49]No.
[171:44.85]This guy is dual welding.
[171:47.83]Don't let him pin you right now.
[171:49.31]Don't let him pin you.
[171:50.17]Come on.
[171:50.79]Get the mounting in here.
[172:00.61]What is he doing?
[172:01.33]Fuck!
[172:10.85]I missed him!
[172:11.57]Oh my god!
[172:12.29]I was trying to like, Sonic roll on him.
[172:23.39]I can't- I'm not gonna get up.
[172:25.35]Balls count anywhere and I'm still on the ground.
[172:33.19]Come on, don't let him do it.
[172:34.97]What just happened?
[172:35.51]I don't know.
[172:41.99]Alright, get some breath here.
[172:42.99]You're not gonna... Oh my god, he did it.
[172:50.79]I didn't think he was gonna do it.
[172:51.65]I didn't think he was gonna do it.
[172:52.71]I didn't think the AI was gonna do it.
[172:53.98]I didn't think the AI was gonna do it.
[172:58.68]Nowhere in my brain was the AI actually gonna jump off the top rope and do that.
[173:09.44]I love this game.
[173:10.34]What a fucking mess.
[173:11.42]Alright, I just have to pin him.
[173:21.07]I hit the mic?
[173:26.95]Finally!
[173:27.41]Just pin him!
[173:28.03]Go!
[173:46.97]Do you see that guy over there just looking, just watching this?
[173:49.73]That guy was asleep?
[174:09.36]He kind of went to sleep.
[174:11.42]I'm gonna get pinned and lose now.
[174:12.84]This is fantastic.
[174:18.92]Alright, get up.
[174:21.98]How has this guy gained?
[174:23.14]I beat this guy's head in with a bench weight.
[174:28.30]You know what I mean?
[174:29.54]It's not even possible to get up from that.
[174:32.31]I had it long ways going into his mouth.
[174:34.35]Like, that guy is dead in one of those.
[174:36.35]Not five or ten.
[174:52.17]Alright, this is it right here.
[174:55.61]You are seriously gonna fuck this up, aren't you?
[174:58.47]One minute remaining.
[175:05.63]Ref!
[175:10.28]That's it?
[175:11.78]Oh my god!
[175:12.84]That's it!
[175:20.30]Hit him!
[175:25.41]You piece of shit!
[175:29.67]You gotta be fucking kidding me!
[175:30.99]Don't even- There's only 19 seconds left!
[175:39.89]Ah!
[175:56.58]God!
[176:09.30]No status effects.
[176:12.37]Tommy Hawk's profile has risen after that.
[176:14.55]Okay, yeah, he got his ass kicked for 15 straight minutes.
[176:20.49]Duke Miniman has generated a buzz.
[176:23.83]That was so funny.
[176:27.94]That was so stupid.
[176:30.19]I couldn't have gone any better.
[176:31.81]I feel like I've just been wheeze laughing this whole time.
[176:36.35]All you've gotten is loud laugh sounds.
[176:40.73]Sharon has renewed her contract.
[176:43.88]Lola has left Strong Style Wrestling.
[176:47.04]Psycho Kid has left Super Lucha Libre.
[176:49.14]Okay.
[176:52.28]Cameron Cool has been released.
[176:56.13]A free agent.
[176:57.83]Cameron Cool has come down with an illness and his poor health is weak.
[177:00.63]What?
[177:00.85]Alright, here we go.
[177:04.07]Jeremy, don't you ever wish that there was someone in your corner to guide you to victory?
[177:08.49]He's the guy that's been supplying me steroids.
[177:11.73]So long as you give me my cut, I'll make sure you never lose another match.
[177:18.81]What do you mean, my cut?
[177:22.43]Should I let the steroid guy be my manager?
[177:25.85]But we need to get signed first.
[177:34.71]I feel like I need somebody.
[177:36.97]Because it's pretty much a coin flip.
[177:39.11]If somebody's going to interfere with the match, I just grab a microphone, start talking, and then attack me.
[177:46.56]It's 50%.
[177:47.10]No, it's not.
[177:50.14]No, fuck off.
[177:50.82]Yeah, whatever.
[177:51.84]I can be solo.
[177:53.58]Didn't I take those goggles off?
[177:54.68]Why are they still on?
[177:56.57]I could be your best friend or your worst enemy.
[177:59.13]Instead of helping you, now I'm going to make sure you lose every match.
[178:02.77]Great.
[178:03.09]That was a great idea.
[178:03.71]Tag team versus Tommy Hawk's team.
[178:12.63]Training session versus somebody.
[178:16.98]Nothing scheduled here.
[178:18.12]And then a public show.
[178:19.34]Alright, here comes the tag team.
[178:22.28]Who's my partner?
[178:32.88]Lucy Lakes and Tommy Hawk.
[178:36.40]What's wrong with Lucy?
[178:40.68]Uh... She doesn't look very well.
[178:50.25]I don't know what to say.
[178:51.09]Cracked out?
[178:55.65]No, I think she's really tired.
[178:57.11]I think she has zero health.
[178:58.25]This should be easy.
[179:00.09]You can't come into the ring with zero health.
[179:03.78]Jerma and Shmoke, are you kidding me?
[179:09.46]What?
[179:10.72]When did this alliance happen?
[179:13.72]He's freaking tired too.
[179:14.62]Hey EvilCorns, thanks for the 25 community subs.
[179:18.89]He's so tired.
[179:20.57]You alright?
[179:25.19]He's sleepy.
[179:25.95]He said, I'm sleepy.
[179:26.99]What?
[179:29.51]You alright?
[179:36.39]I'm sleepy.
[179:37.27]Alright, come on, Schmoke.
[179:41.50]I'll order.
[179:42.48]I know you're watching backstage, which is the safest place for you to be.
[179:48.74]But I'll get my hands on you one day, and this is just a preview of what will happen.
[180:01.11]I thought I just won.
[180:05.61]Why would you have Lucy Legs be in first?
[180:11.91]Ow!
[180:11.97]What does it mean?
[180:17.44]What does it legal?
[180:18.18]What do you mean legal?
[180:20.28]That's a rope break.
[180:22.68]Uh, dude, that's a rope break?
[180:24.20]What the fuck's going on here?
[180:32.96]Why is he doing that?
[180:33.74]Should I tag him in?
[180:42.01]No, why would I ever tag him in?
[180:48.09]I- I gotta make sure he can't tag anybody.
[180:49.41]Fuck!
[180:55.06]Ah, fuck.
[181:00.14]I'm so tired.
[181:03.35]Here we go.
[181:03.71]Alright, I gotta do some more moves.
[181:09.94]I have like an up B, I have a down B. What is he doing?
[181:16.26]Why is there always a table too?
[181:24.32]Here we go.
[181:27.80]Nice move.
[181:37.12]Bring it together.
[181:37.70]I need more... I need chain wrestling.
[181:48.38]Holy shit.
[181:49.48]Oh my god.
[181:50.52]Lucy Lakes... What the fuck was that?
[181:52.42]Ow!
[182:03.69]Ow!
[182:08.46]Where are you going?
[182:14.40]Alright, pick him up.
[182:15.10]Chain wrestling.
[182:15.70]Let's go.
[182:19.38]I'm going to do up.
[182:20.24]I'm going to do left B. No, I'm going to go down B. Oh, see, it's the kick move.
[182:30.09]Okay.
[182:31.31]I hurt my back doing that.
[182:37.32]Nice.
[182:37.76]Alright, I'm gonna have my special.
[182:38.76]This should be pretty easy.
[182:43.20]Submission?
[182:43.58]Yeah, let's do a submission.
[182:50.01]Smoke.
[182:51.09]Smoke, grab him.
[182:52.99]Smoke!
[182:55.55]Smoke, do something!
[182:56.75]Smoke!
[182:58.64]Smoke!
[183:11.47]Alright, I'm tagging in Smoke.
[183:13.07]How do I tag him in?
[183:16.45]Where is he?
[183:16.81]Alright, Smoke, let's go.
[183:18.99]How do I tag in Smoke?
[183:19.93]Come on in, Smoke.
[183:25.63]Do your thing.
[183:29.44]Box him.
[183:32.34]Holy shit.
[183:33.36]He's like a champion boxer.
[183:40.84]Get off the top turnbuckle.
[183:42.10]Can I just go over there?
[183:42.94]I'm just going to go over there and just pull her down.
[183:52.83]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[183:54.21]Alright.
[184:02.75]I'm leaving.
[184:03.33]I'm leaving.
[184:03.69]I'm leaving.
[184:04.07]I'm leaving.
[184:04.44]I'm trying to leave.
[184:05.24]I'm literally trying to get out of the ring right now.
[184:13.87]Get him.
[184:14.93]You idiot.
[184:16.55]Tag me in.
[184:20.91]Tag me in.
[184:21.72]Come here.
[184:23.46]Tag me in.
[184:25.64]Tag me in.
[184:32.14]Tag me in.
[184:33.67]Old man, you're all washed up now.
[184:35.67]Come on.
[184:36.89]Tag me in.
[184:38.55]Good job.
[184:39.41]This is it.
[184:44.06]Wait, it's... Okay, here we go.
[184:50.36]Game over.
[184:51.18]Count it!
[184:52.95]Count it!
[184:54.93]What's with the slow-ass counts?
[185:09.64]Count it!
[185:14.50]Not the ref.
[185:23.43]Count it!
[185:26.71]This ref is paid off, guaranteed.
[185:28.93]By them.
[185:30.33]Like I did, remember that time I did that?
[185:41.96]Oop, slam.
[185:42.36]I'm gonna have my special in a second.
[185:44.64]I don't know what I'm doing here with this guy, but I'm... Holy shit.
[185:58.36]I got my special in a second.
[186:01.90]Oh, it's over.
[186:03.66]It's over!
[186:07.04]Stunner!
[186:09.81]That's it!
[186:13.49]That was a one count.
[186:14.35]I don't know how.
[186:15.01]What happened?
[186:22.48]How is that a one count?
[186:24.22]Alright.
[186:28.10]Come on.
[186:28.78]Shmoe, you gotta do something.
[186:30.50]Whatever his name is.
[186:32.38]Shmork?
[186:33.16]What's this guy's name?
[186:35.36]What?
[186:56.04]So that was a total screw job is what happened.
[187:00.36]Okay.
[187:01.88]Um, well maybe, I guess I deserve that.
[187:04.66]Mm-hmm.
[187:14.45]Omahawk's Damage has risen to 80% of participating.
[187:16.73]Yeah.
[187:17.17]Great.
[187:23.65]Lucy Lake with zero HP.
[187:25.77]One, two, three.
[187:28.11]Now what?
[187:28.45]We're running short of staff tonight.
[187:30.47]Could you sit in on commentary?
[187:32.27]Oh, I love this.
[187:33.09]Yes.
[187:33.75]Absolutely.
[187:34.23]Let's go.
[187:35.61]I need a contract.
[187:36.65]I've been in wrestling school for three hours.
[187:41.67]What the hell?
[187:47.46]Winston Barker and John Crockett.
[187:53.50]I turned the contract down.
[187:54.80]I didn't think that was going to be the only one ever.
[187:57.38]Can I taunt?
[188:04.97]No.
[188:05.43]I'm not going to do anything stupid this time.
[188:06.73]I'm just going to actually commentate.
[188:07.83]I'm not going to get up and punch the guy next to me.
[188:10.87]I didn't even know it was possible.
[188:18.25]So what was this match type?
[188:27.47]Is this just a singles match or what?
[188:28.71]It's a sumo match.
[188:30.07]Okay.
[188:30.29]I'm going to say this is going to be really, really, really early if that's the thing that he's going to ask.
[188:40.69]Okay.
[188:41.27]You know what it takes to win.
[188:42.15]How long do you see this match going?
[188:43.61]It's the same thing.
[188:44.59]The AI is just so dumb.
[188:45.91]They're going to get too close to the ropes and bump into each other.
[188:48.98]Less than five minutes.
[188:57.57]Commentating to no one.
[188:58.49]Well, there's a broadcast at home.
[189:01.06]Holy shit, the announcer!
[189:03.04]That was the guy announcing the game!
[189:04.38]I think, was that the guy that was doing, Ladies and gentlemen!
[189:15.96]Okay, five minutes.
[189:16.92]It's gonna be over right now.
[189:19.24]What's the guy looking at?
[189:19.88]Why are you looking at me?
[189:25.35]Quit looking at me.
[189:30.09]I got my money on... Why is the guy staring at me?
[189:37.91]Gotta go over the top ropes.
[189:46.31]He's going over right now.
[189:47.35]It's over.
[189:49.33]Oh, shit.
[189:49.75]He went the wrong way.
[189:58.62]I'm just staring at John Crockett.
[190:03.18]Can I do, like, commentary?
[190:04.52]No, we just sit here and watch.
[190:07.90]Unless I want to go interfere and be an asshole.
[190:10.65]Get in there.
[190:11.11]No, not yet.
[190:11.99]Not unless I have to.
[190:13.77]I need to get popularity.
[190:18.79]People hate me.
[190:19.37]I keep losing respect.
[190:30.31]Ref versus the ring announcer.
[190:36.27]It's okay to be hated.
[190:44.33]Who are the contestants?
[190:45.29]Russell Haystacks and... Who's the other one?
[190:49.61]Roland Wiener?
[190:53.90]Off the ropes we have uhh...
[190:54.00]Haystacks going into the corner here, now going outside...
[190:57.00]Referee now and coach Emerson decides and the ring announcer at the same time coming in the ring.
[191:03.00]Doug Turner now has got Haystacks by the waist as we have a little bit of an altercation outside.
[191:10.00]As Haystacks misses the grapple going into the referee, but no it seems like coach Emerson has some type of barbell in his hand.
[191:16.00]And the ring announcer seem to be climbing the ropes and going down at the same time, getting some practice, some exercising.
[191:22.61]Good workout for your calves and your hamstrings.
[191:25.11]Into the ring goes the barbell.
[191:29.57]As Haystack now, big right slap into the face of Haystack.
[191:33.25]And that's it, ladies and gentlemen.
[191:34.49]No, it's not.
[191:36.52]He almost eliminated himself, it seems.
[191:48.08]As we have these two guys that are just freaking me out.
[191:50.49]They just keep doing this.
[191:53.11]That would have been so funny.
[191:56.65]Rope break there as the ring announcer is still very angry with the referee.
[192:04.27]Watch out for that bell there as Haystacks comes into Roland Wiener and he gets caught with an armbar.
[192:09.04]Referee's going to probably try to break this one up.
[192:11.52]No.
[192:13.04]There he is again.
[192:13.66]You know what?
[192:14.72]Hold on a minute.
[192:16.10]It seems like, uh, Jerma985 has decided he's gonna get up from his chair, and he is walking over towards, uh, Roland Wiener right now.
[192:25.29]Or John Crockett, I believe it's John Crockett who, uh, Jerma985 is gonna be walking over towards.
[192:30.96]As he gets close enough, Jerma985 I believe is going to, looks like he's getting a, he's going to do a spinning punch right into John Crockett.
[192:37.47]There goes John Crockett now.
[192:39.55]On the ground, Jerma985 has decided that that is going to be the place he's going to go.
[192:43.77]Another right hand onto John Crockett.
[192:47.51]Roland gets grabbed by the arm.
[192:51.45]He's getting his arm bent backwards.
[192:54.07]Ow!
[192:55.59]While Roland has just grabbed him and tossed him over the side arm bar.
[192:59.85]I don't even know what just happened.
[193:08.24]I thought it was a sumo match.
[193:09.46]He's still holding on to me.
[193:16.12]I'm losing health for this, aren't I?
[193:17.63]This is supposed to be a relaxing day.
[193:21.13]Doug Turner's status has not been affected.
[193:25.87]Mr. Barker has improved.
[193:28.74]Emerton's disappointed.
[193:29.58]Okay.
[193:33.98]The Women's Champion.
[193:38.04]Alright, now what?
[193:38.60]I've been keeping an eye on your progress and I think some changes need to be made.
[193:42.11]Well, give me a contract so I can work for something.
[193:46.55]You need better attitude to help with what we're trying to build here.
[193:49.71]Improve your attitude to 78% by the second week in November or it'll give you a spot to someone who appreciates it.
[193:55.20]Alright, confrontation versus Schmoke.
[194:00.70]Well, this does make sense because he just screwed me in the last match.
[194:03.58]Which is completely unfortunate.
[194:07.61]What's going on here?
[194:12.40]Hugging Lucy Lake, pretending to be my tag team partner.
[194:15.36]Paying the ref.
[194:16.54]That was a 3v1.
[194:17.39]That wasn't fair.
[194:17.93]What does he have to say?
[194:30.95]Wasn't I friends with this guy in the beginning of the game?
[194:35.32]Why did that change?
[194:55.66]I'm not going in there without a weapon.
[195:00.26]That's a mistake.
[195:00.74]That guy has a ladder.
[195:01.38]I'm not making that mistake.
[195:03.40]Alright, what do you have to say?
[195:08.82]You made me look bad for the last time, Jerma.
[195:10.50]Why should I tolerate failure?
[195:14.18]You cost me a win.
[195:14.94]If I didn't know better, I'd say you were doing it on purpose.
[195:16.68]Betrayal is the only way you could have hurt anybody.
[195:18.94]You betrayed me.
[195:22.57]We all make mistakes, Schmoke, and agreeing to work with you was my biggest.
[195:30.30]What defines us is what happens next, and you'll need another excuse after I cost you this win.
[195:39.87]Um, and why is that legal again?
[195:41.91]Why is that legal again?
[195:43.90]And why is it legal for him to have, like, a stepladder?
[195:53.40]Get away from me.
[195:54.60]Get away from me.
[196:01.63]Fuck.
[196:07.17]We were friends, Schmoke.
[196:09.91]We could have been good friends.
[196:13.11]But instead, you had to be the traitor and then you paint me as the traitor.
[196:17.89]That's bullshit.
[196:20.19]I'm sorry, but I have to do this.
[196:26.40]American Psycho?
[196:31.55]It's hip to be square.
[196:35.29]It's hip to be square.
[196:38.76]Hey, Paul.
[196:40.68]I bat my friends a minute soon.
[196:42.72]I watch them on TV.
[196:55.09]What just happened?
[196:57.01]I knocked out Schmoke in one minute.
[197:05.74]Schmoke's profile suffered.
[197:07.14]I don't have any friends.
[197:11.57]I need to make my attitude better though.
[197:12.79]Okay.
[197:18.80]More happenings in the league.
[197:22.32]Jerma has been challenged to increase his attitude.
[197:24.12]What am I with it right now?
[197:24.88]75?
[197:25.12]This is my only friend.
[197:29.06]Why are you hanging out with people like Outback?
[197:30.66]I thought I was the only friend you needed, Jerma.
[197:32.58]Why are you gatekeeping me from having friends?
[197:39.10]I need to see other people.
[197:42.30]But I'm not even friends with Outback.
[197:45.14]You got weird information.
[197:46.48]I don't even know who that is.
[197:53.44]Actually, I don't even know what he's talking about.
[197:55.78]I'm glad to hear it, Jerma.
[197:56.72]We can't allow anybody else to come between us.
[198:00.12]Okay.
[198:05.81]This guy's... I don't like this guy.
[198:08.75]Attitude.
[198:11.09]Can I make... I can't make my attitude better.
[198:15.17]How do I increase my attitude?
[198:16.23]What do I do?
[198:23.19]I have this match coming up next.
[198:35.46]Go to relationships.
[198:39.60]Story enemy is now outback.
[198:41.68]Real enemy is outback.
[198:46.00]Why do you think I was my friend?
[198:47.22]This guy hates me.
[198:51.29]It's RNG based.
[198:52.21]You basically lost.
[198:53.43]Oh.
[198:55.42]Did I?
[198:55.68]I'm sorry.
[198:57.70]I'm proceeding.
[199:01.48]Did I do any?
[199:02.14]Wait.
[199:02.34]I at least should level up like strength or something, right?
[199:09.49]How do I get a better attitude?
[199:13.17]75%.
[199:13.27]I did it.
[199:15.15]No, I didn't.
[199:15.81]Did I?
[199:17.61]What did I need?
[199:22.98]78.
[199:23.08]Shit.
[199:24.52]Okay.
[199:30.85]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[199:31.49]78.
[199:34.29]Alright.
[199:37.21]I think I have... I mean, even if I lose this match, I need to get that attitude up.
[199:56.92]Come on, fuck.
[200:00.58]Shoot fight versus- Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[200:03.04]What's going on?
[200:03.85]Shoot fight?
[200:04.81]Okay, I'm so tired now.
[200:26.49]Oh my god, this is in an octagon.
[200:28.79]I can't even climb the ring.
[200:54.67]Wait, is the... Do I just have to leave the ring?
[201:03.92]You won't have to worry about attitude when you're dead.
[201:08.04]I still think I can beat this guy.
[201:13.24]Taking the chair from... Okay.
[201:16.14]I thought the guy was still sitting in it and he was going to bring him in with the guy sitting in the chair.
[201:19.34]Fall down, please.
[201:27.55]I just took the mic from his hand.
[201:28.69]There's nowhere to run now that I got you locked in.
[201:34.55]Only one of us is getting out of here in one piece, and it's not going to be you.
[201:37.21]I'm not locked in here with you.
[201:40.55]You're locked in here with me.
[201:41.95]Oh, my God.
[201:43.68]Oh, my God.
[201:44.00]Oh, my God.
[201:44.28]Get me out.
[201:44.58]Get me out.
[201:44.92]Get me out.
[201:45.32]Get me out.
[201:46.88]Get me out of the ring.
[201:47.42]Get me out.
[201:48.68]Get me out.
[201:56.35]Is he gonna climb in here?
[201:57.81]This guy sucks.
[201:59.11]Actually, this guy might actually be the thing that helps me.
[202:01.05]I think... Oh god, here he comes.
[202:20.17]Oh, my attitude is down.
[202:21.73]I'm dead.
[202:22.35]It's over.
[202:29.42]I need to... We're running short on staff, Jerma.
[202:31.50]Can I count on you to referee one of the matches?
[202:34.84]Yes.
[202:35.26]This is my last chance.
[202:36.92]Can I get my attitude up?
[202:44.95]It's a singles match.
[202:46.07]I'm the referee.
[202:47.59]What if I do a really good job?
[203:00.69]I still have two weeks?
[203:08.47]I'm so tired.
[203:11.43]Master Chrome.
[203:18.12]He wanted to go for another hug.
[203:23.06]Oh, this is the organization that I could have worked for.
[203:26.06]Look at how well they treat each other.
[203:27.58]God damn it.
[203:35.13]Get out.
[203:36.13]You have to get out of here.
[203:37.29]Stay out of the ring.
[203:38.43]I want a clean fight.
[203:44.80]Easy.
[203:56.94]Alright.
[203:57.32]Oh, right.
[203:58.26]One.
[203:58.90]Two.
[203:59.66]Three.
[204:00.78]Four.
[204:01.60]Five.
[204:02.64]Six.
[204:03.66]Seven.
[204:04.00]Eight.
[204:07.34]Get this illegal item out of the ring, please.
[204:12.54]Alright.
[204:12.78]Go on.
[204:20.29]Are you okay?
[204:20.71]You okay?
[204:21.13]You okay?
[204:21.51]Are you okay?
[204:22.01]How you doing?
[204:22.43]You okay?
[204:22.97]Are you okay?
[204:23.39]Are you alright?
[204:23.91]You okay?
[204:30.89]Sorry.
[204:31.11]That looked fun.
[204:33.27]Put that down.
[204:40.90]I gotta make this interesting.
[204:43.98]How you doing?
[204:51.91]Why does this... This guy has so much more health than the other guy.
[204:58.57]Oh!
[205:09.53]What happens if he doesn't get up?
[205:14.11]Alright, get out.
[205:15.15]Excuse me.
[205:15.71]You're not supposed to be in here.
[205:19.07]I said get out.
[205:22.71]Hey, Coach Emerson, you're out of here.
[205:33.12]I kind of want the guy with less health to win because it's more interesting to me.
[205:41.36]Let's see if I can like bait them into doing stupid things.
[205:44.90]What if I put a table in here?
[205:52.38]Where's the table?
[205:57.94]Where's the table?
[205:58.58]I need to find the table.
[206:02.18]Trash can lid.
[206:08.68]Alright, now he's just being goofy.
[206:11.33]Hey.
[206:13.17]What are you doing in here?
[206:14.21]Get out.
[206:16.81]Leave.
[206:17.95]Leave.
[206:19.85]This guy is just acting like a toddler.
[206:22.41]I think this guy tapped out already.
[206:24.37]Like three times.
[206:25.15]Okay, so I can disqualify people, but will I be disqualified from refereeing if I do this?
[206:43.89]Yeah, illegal item.
[206:46.07]Excuse me.
[206:56.25]What the fuck?
[206:57.33]How do you do that?
[207:01.27]Holy shit, he got me a seat.
[207:04.97]This is awesome.
[207:08.21]No, wait, hold on.
[207:08.89]I got a better idea.
[207:12.25]It's time to be the world's shittiest ref.
[207:18.11]Excuse me!
[207:18.79]Oh, you knocked me down!
[207:21.65]I can't even count!
[207:22.31]How am I supposed to count when you knock me down?
[207:28.10]And I'm not even ready.
[207:43.25]I really hope that nobody does anything illegal behind me.
[207:46.49]Hmm.
[207:47.59]It would be such a shame if somebody were to do something illegal.
[207:50.33]Good work.
[207:58.61]I feel like I'm watching my son at the playground.
[208:05.26]Hey, hey, get out of here.
[208:06.56]You're not supposed to be in here, man.
[208:09.66]Oh, whatever.
[208:10.20]I don't fucking care.
[208:12.64]Just don't do anything dumb.
[208:19.68]World's worst lifeguard.
[208:35.48]What are we doing?
[208:50.10]Shit, I'm trying to jump over the ropes.
[208:54.11]Count.
[208:54.73]Oh, right.
[208:55.27]One, two, three, four.
[209:03.09]I forgot I was supposed to count.
[209:07.62]Oh, right.
[209:08.10]Whoops.
[209:26.00]Come on, give me some reputation.
[209:27.34]Give me some attitude.
[209:30.46]79 attitude.
[209:30.90]78.
[209:31.16]Yep.
[209:35.24]Come on.
[209:37.35]Shit.
[209:41.17]Yep.
[209:44.17]No.
[209:46.01]Karma's been challenged and I don't think I got it.
[209:48.91]Oh, I'm in trouble now.
[209:52.86]I don't know what to do to make my attitude better.
[209:56.50]I can cheat?
[209:57.86]What do you mean cheat?
[210:02.40]I can't cheat.
[210:04.62]Go to database?
[210:11.47]Just take drugs.
[210:12.59]I can't take any more drugs.
[210:13.81]I took drugs a bunch.
[210:17.13]You don't have to make every goal.
[210:18.46]Oh, okay.
[210:18.72]I'm going to just rest up.
[210:27.81]Go back to the main menu and edit the universe.
[210:39.96]I guess I could do that.
[210:43.70]Oh.
[210:47.72]I failed.
[210:48.62]I'm afraid this is the end of the road for you.
[210:49.82]Maybe you'll put more effort into your next big idea.
[210:54.39]After 17 weeks, Jerma has retired from wrestling at the age of 35 with meager savings of $2,900.
[211:00.09]He only ever worked for wrestling school where he won 50% of his 12 matches.
[211:04.00]Fuck.
[211:04.10]Shit.
[211:21.21]I'm gone from the roster.
[211:22.97]I actually don't exist anymore.
[211:28.16]I gotta try.
[211:29.02]Now that I know how this game works, we're gonna make a new character.
[211:32.52]Alright, wrestling school.
[211:38.56]We're gonna do Sea Breeze.
[211:41.55]He'll be a good guy this time.
[211:44.87]I gotta go pee.
[211:45.75]I'll be right back.
[211:46.17]We're gonna do another career.
[211:48.13]I'll be right back.
[217:18.87]Okay, I'm back.
[217:21.47]Oh, man.
[217:24.45]This is definitely not the game to play.
[217:28.79]After, like, pulling muscles and... My, like, right middle shoulder into my, like, kind of lower rib is on fire right now.
[217:41.95]But it's worth it.
[217:42.69]This is so fucking funny.
[217:49.62]Uh, yeah, this is, this is an absolute 100% buy.
[217:56.63]Like, this is a run to buy this, in my opinion so far.
[218:00.51]It's just fun.
[218:01.47]It's funny.
[218:01.93]Ugh.
[218:08.68]Alright, so, let's cut back over here.
[218:14.98]I don't want to be me this time.
[218:16.78]I want to be a huge person.
[218:19.00]Let's do that first.
[218:19.78]I want to be like 7 feet tall.
[218:23.38]Should I be 7'10"?
[218:26.48]And 500 pounds?
[218:28.26]Okay, I'm going to be 525 pounds.
[218:31.42]I'm going to be absolutely massive.
[218:33.76]I'm going to be like 20.
[218:34.28]You know what I mean?
[218:35.08]Like 24, 25.
[218:35.22]Not even on the screen.
[218:47.56]Alright, I gotta slow down a little.
[218:50.35]At least see my character.
[218:51.35]Okay, hair.
[218:56.17]Oh shit, here comes the... Okay.
[218:58.19]I gotta mute this.
[219:02.15]Should I put the Terraria soundtrack back on?
[219:03.67]Alright, let me put the Terraria soundtrack on.
[219:17.42]I think it's still open.
[219:18.34]It is.
[219:18.72]Alright.
[219:25.32]Make him tiny?
[219:26.14]He's gotta be huge.

[220:31.64]Holy shit.
[220:33.96]What a great idea.
[220:34.78]What does Mr. Satan look like?
[220:55.50]This is a Batman game?
[221:04.55]What is Mr. Satan?
[221:05.35]I gotta get a picture of Mr. Satan.
[221:07.17]He's an online reference.
[221:11.65]Mr. Satan.
[221:12.57]Okay.
[221:15.52]He's a big mustache.
[221:20.60]He's kind of like got a bald, but it's like an afro.
[221:24.00]Okay, let me see.
[221:26.78]Can I do a big mustache?
[221:29.95]There it is.
[221:30.31]That's actually not bad already.
[221:36.59]I think that's it here.
[222:02.35]Holy shit, it's Mr. Satan!
[222:09.98]Hey, Beard.
[222:10.68]He needs... Okay, glasses off.

[224:07.98]No.
[224:10.30]He has sideburns.
[224:22.13]What does he have?
[224:22.49]Okay, he's got like a ripped chest.
[224:32.98]Okay, it's ripped.

[225:20.50]I need to do purple.
[225:30.59]Wait, what?
[225:31.13]Oh, there we go.

[226:38.30]Oh.
[226:39.88]What does he have for pants?

[226:52.98]Let me get Otto.
[226:56.95]Okay, there he is.
[227:19.36]He wanted to come in and hang out.
[227:22.76]Alright, so now we need... A. Uh, that looks fine.
[227:29.58]Now we need... His pants are... Is everything his arm?
[227:41.08]They're kind of like baggy pants.
[227:44.72]And they're white.
[227:51.70]That...
[227:53.70]Baggy.
[227:54.60]Those are too baggy.
[227:57.38]That's fine.
[227:57.76]Alright.
[227:58.28]These are white.

[228:08.65]He doesn't speak any... He doesn't speak English.
[228:14.81]Okay.
[228:20.73]Oh, the boots.
[228:21.37]The boots are tucked in, actually.
[228:22.51]Yeah, they're tucked.
[228:26.64]Those look good, but I need them to be purple.
[228:36.60]At least a little bit.
[228:40.16]He's got like Confucian lines.
[228:41.74]Alright, the material's gotta change.
[228:46.77]Is there a split one?
[228:50.85]There we go, alright.
[228:53.41]How do I change this color?
[229:00.08]There it is.
[229:00.60]Alright, I'm just gonna flip it.
[229:08.95]Damn it.
[229:13.53]This is probably as close as I'm gonna be able to get this.
[229:18.08]It's just reversed.
[229:18.84]Click on the shape option in shirts to change the cape.
[229:24.40]Okay.
[229:33.08]Alright, there we go.
[229:33.60]A little more purple.
[229:43.05]Alright, that's good.
[229:48.47]They're not that purple, though.
[229:52.39]They're almost like a maroon.
[229:58.94]I can't really... There it is.
[229:59.94]Okay, that's better.
[230:02.08]Like that.
[230:12.06]Okay.
[230:12.78]Now let's do... For the first thing, go to shirts.
[230:19.20]And then shape.
[230:22.68]Oh, I see what you mean.
[230:23.28]Okay.
[230:27.60]Baggy.
[230:28.96]Tight, baggy.
[230:29.92]Tight, baggy.
[230:31.20]That just made him fatter.
[230:39.98]His body is baggy.
[230:41.75]Yeah, what?
[230:48.27]Bag.
[230:49.63]Okay.
[230:52.12]I kind of like that.
[230:52.96]Cool.
[230:54.44]Alright, that's fine.
[231:02.17]His skin is going over his pants and tucking into his pants.
[231:08.17]Alright, cool.
[231:09.53]The hair needs to be a little lighter.
[231:18.96]Maybe a little bit.
[231:23.16]Okay, variation, no.
[231:25.40]I can't do any big extensions on this.
[231:31.52]No, I can't.
[231:32.10]Alright.
[231:32.98]Texture.
[231:33.38]What about the texture?
[231:34.04]Is that fine?
[231:34.50]That looks good.
[231:49.83]Okay.
[231:55.23]If there's a curly texture, it doesn't look like there is.
[232:01.74]I mean, he's kind of balding in this one.
[232:03.90]Is that actually the one we're going to use?
[232:07.22]I kind of... It's the only one... There we go.
[232:17.91]That's like darker.
[232:18.65]He needs chest hair.
[232:34.82]Why are there crumbs in his chest?
[232:51.96]Well, that's the only one I can do.
[232:53.01]Wait, I don't want tattoos.
[232:57.77]Why are there tattoos all over him now?
[233:11.37]Is it the arms?
[233:12.23]Why does he have tattoos all over his arm?
[233:14.48]Oh, there we go.
[233:14.90]Okay.
[233:18.72]Oh, wait.
[233:18.96]I could, like, add this and make this part of the cape, couldn't I?
[233:21.02]Like, that's just the cape, right?
[233:24.72]Oh, yeah.
[233:24.92]Look at that.
[233:25.46]This is just part of the cape.
[233:34.64]There we go.
[233:40.79]These would be the same material, though.
[233:44.08]At least close enough.
[233:44.78]Material 2?
[233:53.28]Material 2.
[233:57.68]It doesn't have wristbands.
[234:04.42]Does he have gloves?
[234:05.62]No.
[234:18.73]That's not bad.
[234:20.35]That looks more like a cape.
[234:22.00]And I gotta make the material the same thing.
[234:23.40]Fuck.
[234:34.17]I'm gonna sneeze.
[234:41.35]Collar?
[234:44.81]Yep, that's fine.
[234:45.64]That's good.
[234:55.21]Alright, Mr. Satan.
[234:56.03]I'm gonna sneeze again, I think.
[234:59.11]I'm trying not to.
[235:00.09]I'm gonna mute.
[235:01.07]That's the perfect time!
[235:02.23]I just, I think I fixed it.
[235:03.27]Okay.
[235:12.53]Legs, that's fine.
[235:17.16]That hair is awful.
[235:20.46]I know it is.
[235:25.97]What about this one?
[235:26.63]No.
[235:45.66]I don't know which is the closest one.
[235:49.14]No bald spot, no bald spot.
[235:50.76]Alright, alright.
[235:52.90]This one?
[235:53.28]That one looks fine, right?
[235:55.95]Ah, that's it.
[235:56.35]That's fine.
[235:56.85]That's good.
[235:58.67]Okay.
[235:59.65]Now I gotta make him bigger.
[236:01.83]Yeah.
[236:03.27]How big is Mr. Satan?
[236:09.49]He's at least, like, seven feet tall, right?
[236:18.28]Look it up.
[236:18.86]Alright.
[236:19.16]How tall is Mr. Satan?
[236:26.01]Uh, Mr. Satan is 6'2".
[236:30.00]What?
[236:33.64]How old is he?
[236:37.58]I thought this was like a typo.
[236:39.20]He's 736 years old.
[236:45.61]What the fuck are they talking about?
[236:50.95]Um, I'm not gonna make him that.
[236:55.18]Alright, how about 7-2?
[236:56.78]He needs to be big and imposing.
[236:57.98]Okay.
[237:07.79]Alright, I'm happy with it.
[237:08.79]Alright, casual.
[237:09.43]I don't... Whatever, it doesn't matter.
[237:20.30]I don't... It doesn't matter.
[237:21.50]No, I just changed his body.
[237:25.52]There we go, okay.
[237:29.32]Wait.
[237:30.36]Oh, he shaves.
[237:31.04]Alright, whatever.
[237:41.13]Whatever, I don't care.
[237:45.41]Wait, isn't Mr. Satan like the strongest man in America?
[237:48.31]He's the strongest man in the entire United States.
[237:50.87]I'm thinking it's a different person.
[237:51.99]Who's that?
[237:57.94]It's the world.
[237:58.64]Oh, okay.
[237:58.98]It's the world.
[237:59.40]Never mind.
[238:06.88]Is that this song?
[238:20.14]Oh, it's Terraria, right?
[238:27.35]I thought it was Mario Galaxy.
[238:37.63]I don't even care.
[238:39.14]Let's go.
[238:39.70]Referee.
[239:07.55]Okay.
[239:09.26]What are his moves?
[239:12.32]Gestures.
[239:12.82]I don't even know what he does.
[239:18.64]Would it be martial arts?
[239:29.30]Powerful.
[239:31.28]Oh, yeah.
[239:31.62]He would be standing very tall.
[239:33.10]Right, right, right.
[239:36.45]Okay, yeah, hold the camera, make a point.
[239:38.31]Double peace signs.
[239:44.49]Hands on hips.
[239:45.15]Grind hips.
[239:47.85]Go to sleep.
[239:48.43]Go away.
[239:48.87]Get out of my face.
[239:49.73]Footwork.
[239:50.22]Folded arms.
[239:50.78]Fist pump.
[239:52.52]Is there a peace sign?
[239:53.28]Diamond sign.
[240:00.62]What the fuck?
[240:08.61]Alright, let's pee.
[240:09.33]Peace sign.
[240:10.11]There's no peace sign.
[240:16.16]Could this be prayer?
[240:16.84]There's raised arms.
[240:32.67]Sure.
[240:36.77]They're good.
[240:37.33]They're good, good, good.
[240:39.19]And middle finger.
[240:40.59]Middle fingers.
[240:43.48]Oh.
[240:46.20]That one.
[240:48.80]Alright, attacks.
[240:51.96]What does he do?
[240:52.30]What does he even do?
[240:54.30]Big uppercut?
[240:59.16]He actually did do middle finger in the Japanese version.
[241:03.08]He did?
[241:09.09]Drop kick is good.
[241:09.81]Forearm, flying knee, flying kick.
[241:16.98]Flying drop kick.
[241:17.84]That sounds awesome.
[241:22.35]What is his move?
[241:24.31]His ultimate move?
[241:24.93]Because that's what we're going to give him for his special.
[241:28.59]He had very flashy, big moves.
[241:31.96]Okay.
[241:32.10]It was the death punch.
[241:42.52]Dynamite Kick.
[241:53.55]Spinning Heel Kick.
[241:55.33]That's pretty sick.
[241:56.82]That one's sick too.
[241:58.50]Top Rope Attack.
[242:00.78]Look at that one.
[242:03.62]That's huge.
[242:19.45]I like, um, super punch.
[242:22.41]Yep.
[242:25.17]Alright.
[242:25.41]Crushes.
[242:25.85]These can be pretty normal.
[242:28.69]Bomb is fine.
[242:31.00]Leg drop is fine.
[242:33.18]Running, uh, when they're on the ground.
[242:35.52]Double stomp.
[242:36.24]That sounds good.
[242:36.92]Flying in the air when they're on the ground.

[246:24.75]Shawn Michaels.
[246:28.69]He would stand in the corner and he would do like a little crow hop and his foot would come up and BOOM!

[247:39.31]I had the Enziguri for the other guy.

[248:33.05]Alright, we're going to have him have... No, we can't just have him be a stunner for every move.
[248:36.49]I want to do that, though.
[248:37.57]I want to give somebody the stunner for every move.
[248:47.54]That's fine.
[248:52.22]I like that.
[248:53.28]Special's low blow.
[248:54.26]Alright.

[251:49.84]We're gonna make everything like decent enough.
[251:53.86]So I don't just get fired in the first like hour.
[252:10.12]Is he popular?
[252:10.68]He is popular, isn't he?
[252:24.12]Max's popularity.
[252:28.00]Sounds pretty Dragon Ball Z to me.
[252:29.36]Yep.

[253:08.88]No.
[253:09.02]Alright, we're going to do... What should we do?
[253:12.00]Smoke?
[253:13.16]Mountains?
[253:13.52]Fireworks?
[253:14.12]Full thing?
[253:15.79]Full works.
[253:24.21]Alright, Mr. Satan is done.
[253:25.71]This does not look like Mr. Satan at all.
[253:33.00]Okay, let's start a career.
[253:37.16]Mr. Satan, I'm ready.
[253:38.72]Wait, somebody please tell him.
[253:48.49]Let him know that he needs to take any contract that comes his way since wrestling school can always ask him to raise stats.
[253:54.47]Oh, shit.
[253:55.29]Okay.
[253:56.85]Good to know.
[253:57.23]Alright, let's kick some ass.
[254:01.18]Mr. Satan!
[254:06.18]Single versus Duke Miniman.
[254:09.22]I'm ready.
[254:10.80]What's my popularity?
[254:11.70]What the fuck?
[254:12.28]Oh, it probably just resets it.
[254:14.46]No drugs this time?
[254:15.40]Yeah, Mr. Satan wouldn't take a drug.
[254:31.24]Why is he talking?
[254:31.90]Where the fuck did I go?
[254:51.53]Do the voice- Alright, I'm gonna kick the shit out of this guy.
[255:00.68]Wait, did this guy age?
[255:05.34]This is the Mountie, isn't it?
[255:08.23]Why did this guy age like 30 years?
[255:10.23]Hey, do I have to babysit the new kid?
[255:22.78]He doesn't belong in the ring with me.
[255:28.66]Don't you remember your first time, Duke Miniman?
[255:30.70]The canvas still has a stain where you pissed your pants.
[255:36.15]We were all here at some point in our lives, and now this is Mr. Satan's chance.
[255:42.27]That's right.
[255:42.77]It's my chance.
[255:44.81]Yeah, well, your first chance is your last chance.
[255:47.35]You never should have signed up for this, kid.
[255:48.99]Isn't he the strongest man in the world?
[256:04.73]Is somebody talking to me on a radio?
[256:11.67]Come on, catch him in the face with that.
[256:12.75]Oh, see ya.
[256:19.60]He's weak?
[256:20.40]Yeah, but he's the strongest person on Earth.
[256:26.22]That move is not good.
[256:27.01]I don't like that at all.
[256:40.00]Test of strength versus Mr. Satan.
[256:41.24]What are you, out of your goddamn mind?
[256:45.77]Now that's how you really get a battle going.
[256:50.15]You don't think I ever trained with no crew, did you?
[256:55.54]Oops.
[257:08.94]Alright, so what happened last time?
[257:10.42]Remember last time when I played, it went the full duration and neither one of us could hurt each other?
[257:15.51]I'm gonna kick him right in the fucking face.
[257:27.40]Like that.
[257:37.94]Oh, it's time.
[257:39.09]It's time.
[257:39.41]What's the special move?
[257:45.63]Oh, you just punch him in the balls.
[257:47.33]That move sucks.
[257:52.56]What a terrible finisher.
[257:57.91]That's not going to win me any matches.
[257:59.31]That's awful.
[258:09.67]Alright, he's done.
[258:14.97]Oh my god.
[258:19.38]This sucks.
[258:21.78]That would be so painful.
[258:33.11]He's not tapping out though, so I'm going to keep doing it.
[258:41.90]I'm pulling him so far back.
[258:49.18]I have the ref too.
[258:56.13]Oh my god!
[258:57.53]Dude, I don't think he can tap out.
[259:01.95]I don't think he's physically able to.
[259:03.54]I don't think he's conscious.
[259:10.89]What happened?
[259:23.10]I'm going to injure this guy.
[259:32.81]Can I pin him?
[259:39.65]Alright, just pin him.
[259:40.55]I gotta end this.
[259:47.38]Alright, I gotta end it with a super kick.
[259:59.70]Fuck, I missed.
[260:01.36]You're ruining him.
[260:02.36]Yeah.
[260:03.62]Goodnight.
[260:06.01]One... Two... Three!
[260:19.91]That's so rude.
[260:21.91]Alright, so I just like ended that guy's career.
[260:25.99]Mr. Satan's profile has improved considerably by winning conventionally in that Latin match.
[260:36.44]Buddy Lee has renewed his contract.
[260:38.18]Alright.
[260:38.38]I thought this said hard gamer.
[260:41.46]Okay.
[260:48.85]Nothing is scheduled, so let's just... You know what?
[260:52.84]If nothing's scheduled, I'm gonna go ahead and just do some... Let's do some strength training.
[260:55.70]82.
[260:57.74]That's good.
[261:15.72]Okay.
[261:17.82]Equally Grappling's ratings have risen.
[261:19.44]Okay.
[261:23.01]Here we go.
[261:23.93]Mr. Satan, have you ever considered changing the strikes in your arsenal?
[261:30.83]What?
[261:32.25]Oh, I like the way that I fight.
[261:36.00]Alright, I can't tell you how to fight.
[261:37.12]I just thought you might want to mix things up a little.
[261:43.04]Singles vs. Tate Madison.
[261:46.46]Let's go.
[261:47.04]Another person just to absolutely decimate.
[261:53.72]This guy doesn't look finished.
[261:54.83]Alright.
[262:29.56]Scorbence, I know you're cowering backstage clinging to that undergraduate title of yours.
[262:37.05]That may be the safest place for you right now, but that treasure can't stay there forever.
[262:44.93]I want you to pay attention to what happens in this match, because you're next.
[262:49.59]Don't you?
[262:52.60]Ow!
[262:52.76]I thought he was gonna beat me.
[263:01.64]Oh my god, I got him from behind again.
[263:17.18]Why is the ref holding the microphone?
[263:20.52]Like, put it down, bro.
[263:32.56]Perfect.
[263:34.42]Suplex!
[264:04.15]What?
[264:04.41]Come here!
[264:12.17]That's illegal!
[264:20.11]What did I just do?
[264:21.05]Alright, don't fuck this up.
[264:34.53]He's done.
[264:44.39]What are you thinking, dude?
[264:45.43]Are you serious?
[264:46.67]I'll get you every time.
[264:47.43]Referee, what are you doing?
[265:03.70]Yeah, Mr. Satan is way better than Jerma985 was.
[265:07.33]Jerma985 was awful in comparison.
[265:10.43]Look how much cleaner these matches are.
[265:14.87]And it's not even a stats thing.
[265:16.03]I think the stats got reset, didn't they?
[265:26.86]Again.
[265:27.06]1, 2, 3.
[265:38.55]Just like a DBZ fight.
[265:45.57]Oh my god!
[265:47.21]Oh my god, that was horrible!
[265:50.62]That was fucking horrible!
[266:00.29]That's making me cr- That's making me cringe backwards.
[266:07.64]This guy's actually a formidable foe.
[266:14.35]Get up.
[266:15.01]Alright, let's do this one.
[266:15.91]Again.
[266:34.35]I don't know what just happened, but I think I won.
[266:36.65]I think I did a good job there.
[266:45.56]Bring the frame rate down on the screen to make it look like a DVZ fight.
[266:49.02]What is he doing?
[266:51.99]Wait, do I have him or does he have me?
[266:54.41]I can't tell.
[266:56.37]I think I had him.
[267:06.55]Oh, that felt good!
[267:07.73]I wanted to go off the ropes.
[267:26.03]Alright, this match is over.
[267:30.99]Holy shit.
[267:31.63]Alright, pin him.
[267:40.93]Again.
[267:41.17]Again.
[267:41.73]Catch him with that.
[267:47.31]You get to get one move on me.
[267:48.77]That's fine.
[267:50.65]No, you don't even get one move.
[267:51.71]Pin him.
[267:58.38]Hate Madison, please get up.
[268:01.72]That's not going to happen.
[268:04.42]Alright, let's break his neck.
[268:15.42]I want to hear those crunches.
[268:20.05]That's it.
[268:21.11]Yeah, it's over.
[268:26.08]There's literally nowhere for him to go besides to tap out.
[268:33.80]I'm pulling so hard in his head.
[268:35.73]He's got resilience.
[268:44.02]You know what I like about this game?
[268:45.20]I like that you... Okay, so see how if I hold down the strike button, you do like a... Or you can just do it lightly.
[268:52.33]There's a range of holding it.
[268:58.51]This is honestly the best like actually wrestling video game that I've played since like No Mercy.
[269:04.56]I really think that.
[269:18.26]This is actually a good wrestling game.
[269:19.98]Because this one makes sense.
[269:28.88]The new wrestling... I've tried to play the new WWE games.
[269:31.70]It's kind of confusing and weirdly controlling.
[269:35.08]It's like hard to control.
[269:36.12]It's strange.
[269:38.70]Hey Mr. Satan, everybody knows that decision was bogus.
[269:40.96]Are you going to fall down?
[269:44.50]If you had any decency, you would agree to restart this match and prove that you can beat me properly.
[269:50.20]Sure.
[269:52.66]Fine.
[269:53.00]Restart the match.
[269:53.76]Let's do it again.
[269:54.32]I'll take the shit out of you a second time.
[269:56.76]You're not the coward I thought you were, but we both know the result will be different this time.
[269:59.59]Are you leaving?
[270:01.81]Don't leave.
[270:09.11]This time I'm going to kill him.
[270:18.06]Okay.
[270:19.14]Let's see how you feel after this one.
[270:22.20]Alright.
[270:24.04]Yeah, it's double or nothing.
[270:25.00]This really is just me.
[270:32.07]You know what?
[270:34.37]Don't let him get away.
[270:36.73]Get into the corner.
[270:39.53]Never mind.
[270:40.44]He's... He's just sad.
[270:49.59]Count him!
[270:50.13]Fucking count him!
[270:52.91]What are you doing?
[270:53.45]Are you kidding me?
[271:05.88]Oh my god, he's broken to death!
[271:14.64]I really want to, like, break his neck.
[271:17.16]I know that's, like, fucked up, but... I mean, this guy... He can't come in twice.
[271:21.33]What is he inspecting?
[271:22.25]Oh my god, really?
[271:29.45]I just... End it.
[271:36.74]One... Two...
[271:46.91]No, you're not going to pin me.
[271:48.17]You know what?
[271:48.91]This is so good to be huge.
[271:50.49]Because I will rope break 30-40% of every single pin just because of how big I am.
[272:13.94]Alright, when's the UFC thing gonna happen where the guy just steps in and starts pulling me off?
[272:17.56]I'm gonna have to call this.
[272:18.30]Uh-oh.
[272:32.10]Did I just lose the test of strength to the guy that's barely standing?
[272:43.26]There's no way this guy is gonna get up after this shit.
[272:46.62]I'm sorry.
[272:52.30]Why is he still going?
[273:05.27]Get the fuck out of here.
[273:10.66]This is supposed to... I fought him... What's wrong with my arm?
[273:22.91]I broke his back.
[273:23.61]That's enough.
[273:24.95]Stay down.
[273:27.35]What does it take to keep this guy down?
[273:29.93]Seriously.
[273:32.33]What does it take to keep this idiot down?
[273:33.70]Like, just stay down.
[273:43.20]That's it.
[273:47.69]Finally.
[273:48.15]That encounter established Mr. Satan as a heel.
[274:01.43]What?
[274:05.09]Why would that make me a heel?
[274:06.15]The guy challenged me to a second fight and I kicked his ass again.
[274:10.82]Why does that make me a heel?
[274:11.66]Doesn't that make him just stupid?
[274:17.06]Why do I have to be a bad guy because the other guy is dumb?
[274:18.92]Because you broke his neck four times.
[274:30.43]Whatever.
[274:31.07]You're gonna challenge me to a double or nothing match in the same day?
[274:33.63]It's because you kept hitting him in the balls.
[274:44.02]Oh.
[274:45.66]Here's this guy again.
[274:46.42]Hey, Mr. Satan, don't you ever wish that there was someone in your corner to guide you to victory?
[274:52.16]Yeah, I mean, sometimes I do, but I heard that you're a real weirdo.
[274:57.94]I want nothing to do with you.
[275:06.11]Perhaps we can work together some other time.
[275:07.49]I've always got your back if you need it, Mr. Satan.
[275:10.97]Now, this is the creepy guy that only wants to have you be his only friend.
[275:16.56]Alright, four-man elimination.
[275:20.41]Going for it.
[275:21.05]This is four-man.
[275:37.11]Just quick and to the point, you know?
[275:41.23]Samson.
[275:50.05]Is that... Is that just a John Cena thing?
[275:56.66]Samson.
[275:58.32]And... Skor Benz.
[276:07.27]I like the red.
[276:19.73]Duke Miniman, back at it again.
[276:21.65]Why do they always do that?
[276:33.18]The AI just goes, you know what, I'm gonna grab the table for a second.
[276:42.27]I'm being forced to defend my title against three of their opponents, and that's just not fair.
[276:45.81]Wait...
[276:47.40]Is this for the championship?
[276:49.42]I'm not even out of school.
[276:51.64]It's some sort of conspiracy to get the title off of me.
[276:57.63]But I didn't become champion in the first place by backing down from a challenge.
[277:00.25]This will be just my biggest win yet.
[277:14.72]We're all just stopping this guy.
[277:20.62]Hey, what are you doing, Duke Miniman?
[277:22.16]Get the fuck out of here.
[277:24.24]I'm gonna beat the absolute shit out of your face.
[277:33.05]Ow.
[277:34.91]My biggest win yet.
[277:36.03]Wait, aren't we all against him?
[277:41.65]So wait, why?
[277:42.57]Wait.
[277:43.25]Should I not have been punching him in the face?
[277:44.73]I'm just confused.
[277:49.98]on the same team.
[277:56.76]What the- Oh my god, let go of my leg!
[278:00.70]Let go!
[278:02.28]Let go!
[278:04.68]How do I get off?
[278:08.36]Wait, whose leg?
[278:09.44]Am I the one with the red pants?
[278:11.87]No, alright.
[278:13.37]I was like weird.
[278:14.21]I didn't know which character I was.
[278:17.26]Alright, Sprig, snap his arm off.
[278:19.74]Do something.
[278:29.69]I can't believe, look at my health.
[278:30.71]That's so dumb.
[278:37.78]Get up.
[278:51.51]Wait, no, ref can't see.
[278:53.61]Is this illegal if I do?
[278:57.95]I broke his finger!
[279:00.11]I hit him right in the index finger and I smashed it into like a little curled up thing.
[279:06.03]Oh my god, that was horrible looking.
[279:09.13]What the fuck was that?
[279:17.08]Put him down!
[279:17.76]Oh, that was ridiculous.
[279:27.14]His poor finger.
[279:27.98]It's like he was showing his boo-boo to the school nurse.
[279:34.00]Wait, is somebody being pinned?
[279:35.12]Alright, I'm...
[279:45.56]That was a double right there.
[279:47.68]You.
[279:48.08]You know what?
[279:48.54]I'm coming for you.
[279:49.12]Fuck you.
[279:49.60]Holy shit.
[280:02.45]Oh my god.
[280:10.22]I'm sick of this guy.
[280:15.78]It's just first to get a pen?
[280:19.78]Oh my goodness, that almost happened.
[280:28.12]Holy fuck.
[280:30.43]That was insanity.
[280:41.17]If you're a big fat guy, just roll over.
[280:45.81]Get him off me! Get him off me! Get him off me! Get him off me! Get him off me!
[281:00.90]Really?
[281:01.20]He's gonna take turns?
[281:13.82]This guy has almost full health, this Samson guy.
[281:19.90]Oh, fuck, he caught the leg.
[281:22.17]He's biting me.
[281:31.59]Fuck, I missed.
[281:39.17]Nope.
[281:47.15]Oh, I missed!
[281:49.27]Saw that.
[281:49.63]He springboarded off of my belly.
[281:57.39]What was that cartoon Tom and Jerry bullshit?
[281:59.97]What was that?
[282:05.40]Do I get credit for that?
[282:07.32]If he gets eliminated?
[282:22.45]I'm going up.
[282:23.55]Fuck it.
[282:27.61]That would have snapped his neck in half.
[282:30.82]I must have a special too.
[282:34.96]No.
[282:35.76]Somebody help me.
[282:39.84]Oh my god.
[282:52.73]That's it.
[282:53.15]I'm the champion.
[282:56.39]I'm the champion.
[282:58.43]Oh, no, never mind.
[283:02.45]That was insane.
[283:03.21]I, like, belly-to-back suplexed him into the guy's head.
[283:05.66]And he did a Hurricane Rana on the guy.
[283:10.12]I'll take this one, too.
[283:19.17]Get out of the way.
[283:22.24]I want to hit him right in his forehead.
[283:29.31]There it is.
[283:29.67]No, I don't want to step on the ref.
[283:46.23]On his head, on his head, on his head.
[283:54.68]This is a big opportunity for me to get... Will I be the champion?
[283:57.35]Will I actually just be the champion?
[284:03.07]Opportunity knock in right air.
[284:04.35]Come on.
[284:08.77]Oh, he hit his head on something.
[284:09.97]That was... That was a very loud noise.
[284:15.97]One.
[284:18.09]Two.
[284:31.68]What's happening right now?
[284:35.11]Cartoon boink sound?
[284:39.27]Oh, that was deadly.
[284:43.73]Alright.
[284:44.69]This is the game winner right here.
[284:57.48]Did you actually reverse that?
[284:58.74]How?
[285:01.93]This, by the way, guys, this is drug-free.
[285:03.77]So, don't even tell me that I'm on drugs.
[285:08.84]Um... Um... No, get up!
[285:23.87]That's fine.
[285:24.67]That's eliminated.
[285:25.65]That's eliminated.
[285:33.59]Oh boy, that's big.
[285:35.33]That's huge right there.
[285:36.47]That's huge.
[285:44.82]That's it.
[285:47.72]Oh, come on.
[285:57.23]You want to eliminate yourself?
[285:58.07]That's fine.
[285:59.84]I'll just taunt until I have a low blow.
[286:01.91]And then I'll hit you in the nuts and pin you.
[286:04.99]Is this some kind of taunt?
[286:06.11]Like you're going to be the champion?
[286:06.97]You're the next champion?
[286:07.69]Is that what this is?
[286:11.35]Okay, sure.
[286:15.53]You know you have to win to be the champion.
[286:16.99]You know that, right?
[286:17.43]You have to actually win, dude.
[286:20.35]Like, you understand?
[286:22.23]And you're never going to wake up after that one ever again.
[286:26.61]Fuck.
[286:32.98]That's my belt, actually.
[286:36.47]See you later.
[286:37.37]I'm now the champion.
[286:39.31]Undergraduate champion.
[286:49.45]Alright.
[286:50.41]Now I'm going to get a lot of offers, right?
[286:51.91]I'm going to get called by all kinds of agencies.
[286:59.17]I need to get... I better get a lot of points for this.
[287:04.13]Okay, that makes sense.
[287:06.11]Mr. Satan, the new champion.
[287:07.89]Look at that.
[287:08.75]How did I lose points?
[287:09.67]I got the Victory Royale.
[287:27.09]Still not signed.
[287:32.89]A lot of changes this week.
[287:34.05]Alright, now what?
[287:35.87]We've taken each other to hell and back, Mr. Satan.
[287:38.06]And I've had enough of it.
[287:39.16]I don't even know who this guy is.
[287:43.20]Why don't we bury the hatchet so that we can both get back to concentrating on our careers?
[287:51.24]Let's make peace.
[287:53.31]Oh, this is Samson.
[287:54.73]Oh, no, this is the previous champion.
[288:00.15]Um...
[288:05.75]Oh, you go fuck yourself.
[288:09.15]I just remembered why I hate you so much.
[288:10.90]I should have known you couldn't be reasoned with.
[288:12.76]Oh yeah, I'm supposed to be a good guy.
[288:17.38]Whatever.
[288:17.66]Death of three for the undergraduate championship versus hard gainer.
[288:25.49]We have to win three matches in a row?
[288:40.27]Yeah, wear that shit.
[288:41.25]Let's go.
[289:01.98]Get a good shot of this ref.
[289:07.07]Hard gainer.
[289:07.75]Oh, it's the skeleton guy.
[289:08.95]Okay.
[289:16.55]Letting you do your own intro is really cool.
[289:19.17]It is.
[289:26.16]For anyone who wasn't paying attention, I am the new undergraduate champion of wrestling school.
[289:30.31]A lot of people thought it would never happen, and you ignorant morons should admit that you were wrong.
[289:41.40]I've achieved all this without anybody's support, so the only person I can thank is myself.
[289:45.88]Doing a 40-50% Mr. Satan, so I can do it for a long period of time.
[289:51.68]Here, Mr. Satan will change wrestling school forever.
[289:58.73]Oh, that was not fair.
[289:59.53]Alright, Hardgainer, let's see what you're made of.
[290:05.33]Can you handle a fucking flurry of punches like this?
[290:11.02]Bye.
[290:24.57]Get a shot of that one.
[290:25.61]Oh, it seems that Goku seems to have fallen down out of the arena.
[290:34.65]Join us next time on Dragon Ball Z to see what happens to Goku.
[290:46.79]Oh, I hate this voice.
[290:52.96]Sorry.
[290:55.90]I gotta do another move besides that.
[290:59.68]Nobody's a match for me.
[291:01.22]I'm just so strong.
[291:06.40]I'm not even that much different than the Jerma character was, though.
[291:08.52]That's the thing that's more annoying.
[291:15.70]Damn, that was cool.
[291:21.62]Alright, let's do some more stuff off the ropes.
[291:24.64]In that corner.
[291:28.72]Alright, this guy's fucked.
[291:36.16]Now that I got him on the ground, let's go!
[291:37.22]Oh, shit.
[291:40.89]Nice.
[291:56.33]There's three weight classes above these guys.
[291:58.39]Oh yeah, aren't I like 500 pounds?
[292:07.32]You know what time it is.
[292:08.62]It's time for the balls punch.
[292:13.78]I have to do this three times.
[292:26.53]Pick him up.
[292:27.53]Let's do, um... Like that.
[292:34.55]That's what makes you a heal.
[292:35.74]What did I just do?
[292:41.16]It's a jumping double stomp?
[292:45.62]That's kind of a cool move.
[292:46.46]I like that.
[292:51.32]Waiting for him.
[292:51.90]This is what Shawn Michaels used to do.
[292:56.07]Well, not in that order, but you know.
[293:06.50]What point is that, like, not allowed?
[293:11.25]He's counting with the chair.
[293:32.20]One fall just spin it again Stop I didn't wasn't trying to do that on that one It's time for the dive What am I doing?
[293:53.43]I'm trying to grab him for the ropes.
[293:55.31]Am I stuck?
[293:55.93]Oh
[293:58.90]Didn't even want to do that.
[294:06.11]It's two.
[294:08.51]That's it.
[294:15.50]Match is over.
[294:15.96]It doesn't matter anymore.
[294:25.17]Mr. Satan has cemented his reign by defending the undergraduate championship.
[294:36.76]This is going way better than the last one.
[294:38.40]Alright, give me a contract.
[294:47.83]An online poll has identified Lance Monaco as the highest paid wrestler in the world.
[294:54.21]Mr. Satan, have you ever considered changing the way you conduct yourself in the ring?
[294:58.96]What do you mean?
[294:59.34]The way you do something can be more important than what you do.
[295:04.80]A few gestures could help you express yourself.
[295:11.12]Oh, he wants me to be nicer?
[295:12.18]Sure, I can change.
[295:17.21]That's very open-minded of you.
[295:20.41]I look forward to seeing the new you.
[295:27.22]How do I do that?
[295:27.80]Alright, let's take away the low blow.
[295:33.74]I don't want it.
[295:34.30]I want something cool.
[295:35.22]Something powerful.
[295:36.76]How about the power factor?
[295:41.73]How about just a straight up power bomb?
[295:49.23]Yeah.
[295:58.06]That's horrible.
[296:02.84]Op up stunner?
[296:03.74]No, no.
[296:15.64]No more ball crushing?
[296:16.80]No, I won't.
[296:17.34]No more.
[296:28.53]What's this one do?
[296:30.53]Jumping face buster?
[296:32.33]No.
[296:36.32]How did your special move is just throwing a guy into the ropes?
[296:38.60]It's horrible.
[296:39.96]That wrench suplex?
[296:44.74]Guillotine choke.
[296:48.56]I mean... I've been doing a lot of submissions and it's been working pretty well.
[296:52.43]Maybe I should really just do just a special move that just rips their head off.
[296:55.73]Yeah.
[297:09.92]Oh, that's alright.
[297:13.38]That's fine.
[297:16.06]This is Last Man Standing versus Score Benz.
[297:24.02]Oh, it changes the gestures for you automatically.
[297:29.31]Oh, this is stupid.
[297:29.99]It's just me waving to the crowd.
[297:31.43]I have to be Mr. Nice Guy now?
[297:36.61]Wave to the kids!
[297:47.48]Alright, score bends.
[297:48.84]Last man standing.
[297:57.44]Make sure you pick up a weapon, bring it into the ring really, really slowly.
[298:01.94]And then drop it, because it's illegal.
[298:08.03]I've been where you are now, Mr. Satan.
[298:09.93]I remember what it's like to be under the undergraduate champion.
[298:15.57]But I've also felt something you can't yet imagine, and that's the burning desire to claim it back.
[298:23.57]If I have to climb over you to get back to the top of the mountain, then that's what I'm prepared to do.
[298:31.10]Anybody worth of this title would have let it go.
[298:33.54]You were a loser then, Scorbunch, and you're a loser now.
[298:39.76]2 o'clock in the morning and I don't want to wake up my mother in the other room by doing the Mr. Satan voice, so I'm doing a really shitty, awful version of it.
[298:48.85]Put that down.
[298:50.45]Wait, can we use that?
[298:55.24]Is that illegal?
[298:55.76]It doesn't say it is.
[299:11.01]Why do I keep hitting myself in the head?
[299:13.87]Why do I keep hitting myself?
[299:15.95]Why?
[299:16.25]Is this what you want?
[299:19.02]Is that what you're looking for?
[299:19.90]He throat punched me.
[299:33.88]Oh my god.
[299:35.04]What the fuck just happened?
[299:36.94]That hurt me more than it hurt him.
[299:43.93]Holy shit!
[300:00.28]Oh, I'm sorry.
[300:00.82]How do I let you go?
[300:01.34]How do I let you go?
[300:02.68]Keep counting.
[300:06.54]Keep counting.
[300:19.57]I'm in the worst place.
[300:24.28]Oh my god.
[300:25.42]This is fucking awful.
[300:30.68]Stop it, Mr. Satan.
[300:32.40]Stop.
[300:35.88]I can't do that.
[300:38.43]I have to stop.
[300:39.41]I can't.
[300:40.33]I'm gonna get hurt.
[300:43.31]I can't.
[300:45.62]Why does he keep doing that?
[300:48.38]I don't understand why he does that.
[300:50.70]I don't get it.
[300:54.03]Why does he hit himself in the face as hard as he can?
[300:56.55]Why?
[300:57.49]I can't.
[301:08.52]No, give me that back.
[301:14.84]Oh my god.
[301:15.78]He's wearing the belt?
[301:20.56]Fuck.
[301:26.46]Two.
[301:31.52]Three.
[301:36.03]Four.
[301:38.33]Five.
[301:40.63]Six.
[301:40.85]Seven.
[301:48.46]I win.
[302:02.15]Oh, he suffered considerably.
[302:04.46]Considerably.
[302:05.10]Satan has cemented his reign by defending the championship again.
[302:16.17]There has to be some reason why.
[302:17.47]Maybe if you do it too many times in a row, you'll just mess up and hit yourself in the face.
[302:23.35]But that seems to happen all the time.
[302:26.53]Mr. Satan's association with Matt Black has a negative effect on his attitude.
[302:33.50]No, it doesn't.
[302:34.42]I don't care about that guy.
[302:35.34]Why would I care about that guy?
[302:36.18]Yeah.
[302:46.20]Okay.
[302:48.25]Mr. Satan, why don't you give me a shot at your undergraduate on the first week of September?
[302:51.73]Okay.
[302:58.41]You know, yeah.
[302:59.19]Sure.
[303:00.69]Sure.
[303:01.79]That's a date.
[303:04.29]You know why?
[303:06.33]I'll see you on the first of September.
[303:07.49]Make sure you're ready because I know I will be.
[303:10.36]That's a respectable thing to do.
[303:12.40]He didn't interfere with the match.
[303:13.52]He didn't, like, come out with a mic and talk a bunch of shit about me.
[303:17.52]He didn't, like, be somebody's manager and hit me from behind and stuff.
[303:20.68]He literally just said, hey, like, I want a shot at the title.
[303:24.73]Do you think I deserve a shot?
[303:25.65]It's like, yeah, alright.
[303:26.59]Let's see what you got.
[303:27.11]This is a tables match versus Crucial Kennedy.
[303:58.69]Nope, I don't want to throw that in.
[304:00.35]I want the table, there it is.
[304:01.19]Alright, what's Powerbomb?
[304:10.01]Crucial Kennedy.
[304:16.64]Who's this guy, by the way?
[304:20.02]Why is that guy out here?
[304:28.66]My god, that would have been so funny if he stayed out there.
[304:32.80]Whatever, I don't care what you just said.
[304:34.20]Nobody cares.
[304:34.66]Yeah, you wish you could have that, don't you?
[304:50.24]Through the table.
[304:52.46]Oops.
[304:57.01]Nope.
[304:57.57]Reversal.
[304:59.05]Get over here.
[305:00.19]Do I have any... Do I have like a suplex or something?
[305:03.40]I want to put him through the table.
[305:10.68]Let's... No, god damn it.
[305:12.14]I want that back.
[305:16.35]The guy's coming in here to fight me, I think.
[305:20.27]No, he just was crossing the ring.
[305:23.41]Oh, I made this guy, by the way.
[305:24.67]I made Craft Men.
[305:26.93]He was supposed to be like a craft beer guy, and I thought it was funny.
[305:39.16]I'm just loading the ring with fucking tables.
[305:50.57]Okay, he's still in here.
[305:56.10]This is a tables match.
[305:56.90]I'm going to use them.
[305:58.04]Alright, let's do it.
[306:04.12]Oh, you want to stack this shit?
[306:05.44]Are you out of your mind?
[306:06.28]Can we do three?
[306:15.09]What if we're both working together?
[306:16.27]We're like building a house together.
[306:17.45]Holy shit.
[306:21.07]Are you kidding me?
[306:24.29]Um...
[306:29.72]Oh, God damn it!
[306:31.02]What?
[306:39.48]What?
[306:40.26]What?
[306:41.80]What?
[306:42.14]Are you kidding me?
[306:43.08]I weighed too much.
[306:49.73]Did I weigh too much?
[306:52.77]That was stupid.
[306:53.99]That was actually stupid.
[306:58.48]That was for the championship.
[307:02.10]It was a trap.
[307:05.16]Okay.
[307:06.06]Whatever.
[307:06.42]I lost status.
[307:09.86]Yeah, that's unbelievable.
[307:12.06]It's alright.
[307:21.00]I had the belt for five matches.
[307:23.54]I'll get it back.
[307:28.39]There goes the contract.
[307:29.35]No, I'm gonna get offered a contract right now.
[307:32.01]If you were watching, you would know that that was a fluke.
[307:37.70]That was bullshit.
[307:38.58]Everybody knows it.
[307:39.06]It was a total fluke.
[307:47.32]That guy didn't beat me.
[307:48.52]I'm still as skilled as I was before.
[307:50.86]I'm just too heavy to stand on three tables.
[307:53.38]I got too cocky.
[307:56.30]I weigh 600 pounds, guys.
[307:57.86]That's not being a bad wrestler, that's just being too big.
[308:01.20]Oh, this guy's probably really pissed.
[308:10.61]This is the guy that wanted to do the title match, but I just lost the title.
[308:15.95]So now he's just... Oh, well, great.
[308:18.80]We're just gonna have a regular match now.
[308:21.66]He's probably pissed.
[308:35.75]His back is hurt already.
[308:37.03]I asked for a sunflower pick last stream.
[308:49.15]Oh, well.
[308:52.51]I'll show you a pick when I want to show you a pick.
[308:55.46]We don't demand things.
[308:59.98]When I have photos of the sunflowers and they're in nice and full bloom, I'm going to show them to you.
[309:04.38]We don't demand things here, excuse me.
[309:06.50]That would have been awesome if it hit him.
[309:25.09]Oh, shit.
[309:33.35]I'm fine.
[309:33.85]Alright, he's gonna mess this up.
[309:37.03]Oh, that's a broken leg.
[309:37.98]Oh, shit.
[309:43.26]Hey!
[309:43.58]This is bad news.
[309:49.62]Get out.
[309:58.79]I just rolled into that.
[309:59.91]I feel like that happens to me in Dark Souls all the time.
[310:07.23]Pick him up.
[310:10.65]Big DDT.
[310:14.61]Shit.
[310:22.46]This game is Dark Souls PvP.
[310:24.14]Alright, I'm going to try another move here.
[310:28.16]Let's go like this.
[310:29.38]Let's do the arm spread.
[310:34.17]Let's do the pregnancy class thing.
[310:38.35]Okay.
[310:54.36]I just spit all over myself because of how close the referee was getting.
[311:04.97]What happened?
[311:05.41]Oh my god, is he okay?
[311:07.79]Pin him.
[311:08.15]I think he got hurt.
[311:10.61]What happened to him?
[311:14.24]I think he... With his broken arm?
[311:20.44]Don't even tell me this guy's going to beat me with a broken shoulder.
[311:23.35]Oh, I know what to do now.
[311:29.09]Okay, yeah.
[311:29.91]Come here.
[311:36.71]I want to pin him.
[311:38.09]Oh, he's not moving.
[311:47.36]Oh, he tapped instantly.
[311:57.35]Roland Wiener injured his shoulder in that match and will be out of action for the next two weeks.
[312:03.53]Oh, you can actually get injured.
[312:06.85]Mr. Satan's profile has improved.
[312:08.13]Alright, get me back in like a big title match.
[312:18.77]Running short of staff tonight, can you do commentary?
[312:20.67]Yep, I'd love this.
[312:23.18]One of my favorite things is sitting at the desk and then deciding when I'm going to laugh out loud, get up, and attack somebody.
[312:32.52]My favorite thing to do.
[312:38.46]Valhalla.
[312:42.43]What am I drinking?
[312:43.63]Just water.
[312:47.67]What happened?
[312:49.35]Somebody sabotaged this guy.
[312:51.65]It was a landmine.
[312:52.62]Somebody just... What?
[312:55.52]Hey, we're using that desk.
[313:00.32]Okay.
[313:02.08]Um...
[313:08.80]Rupert Royal.
[313:16.28]What are you doing?
[313:17.04]Alright.
[313:18.48]Fucking using that.
[313:20.48]Fuck.
[313:22.88]Fuck you, buddy.
[313:23.72]Alright.
[313:24.22]I'm sick of this bullshit.
[313:25.38]Give me that fucking thing.
[313:40.19]Cut the shit.
[313:41.35]Ridiculous.
[313:46.11]Mike Bale with Shang.
[313:49.95]Is this a tag team?
[313:56.09]Why am I in the audience?
[313:58.93]You know what it's like to be in there.
[314:00.05]How do you see this match ending?
[314:12.94]about this is it's bent.
[314:16.41]Which means I've already hit somebody in the head with this.
[314:19.71]It'll be by pinfall, of course.
[314:28.77]Let's see how if it ends by pinfall.
[314:38.07]Where am I?
[314:45.07]Oh, I'm supposed to be doing... Oh, I'm a commentator, right.
[315:03.70]Just give them stuff to, like, disqualify each other with.
[315:07.25]Somebody will make a mistake, you know what I mean?
[315:11.09]Somebody will make a mistake and... Wait, can I get in the ring?
[315:23.36]Who am I even doing this to?
[315:45.65]I feel like I should have just downed a beer before I do that and like do a back drop into a pool right on my back.
[315:54.08]It's like everyone at the party is like, holy shit, dude, that probably hurt a lot.
[315:59.06]Fuck everybody here.
[316:02.74]Crack on his back and it's like, oh, fuck.
[316:04.77]His back is bright red.
[316:14.85]Okay, I'm gonna go sit down.
[316:20.83]Oh, this is a stupid... I don't even know what's happening.
[316:27.01]Is this a pin?
[316:27.75]Here comes a pinfall.
[316:37.52]I got it right.
[316:39.44]That's right, I did.
[316:41.96]Satan always gets right.
[316:52.04]Oh, that was unbelievable.
[316:54.12]This game is insane.
[316:59.14]Oh, what a ridiculous game.
[317:04.16]Did I get any points?
[317:08.96]Jank is disappointed that his client lost.
[317:15.50]Okay, second week of September.
[317:19.00]Do I get another title match?
[317:29.45]Oh, tough love.
[317:31.25]The industry will come together to stage a special charity event on the third week of September.
[317:37.59]Mr. Satan has been branded negligent for injuring Roland Wiener in their recent match.
[317:44.80]What?
[317:47.96]Coming up next is a submission match versus Schmoke.
[317:59.95]My special move is a submission.
[318:01.17]Alright, I have to play.
[318:14.52]God damn.
[318:17.68]I can count on fingers and toes the amount of times that I've laughed really hard at this game.
[318:22.61]This is, what a treat this has been.
[318:24.71]I'm serious.
[318:25.49]This has been unbelievable.
[318:29.43]Do I get to put this in game of the year even though it's a remake?
[318:32.12]I can, right?
[318:33.34]Like, this is up there.
[318:34.24]It has to be.
[318:35.20]It's like top three games of the year.
[318:38.24]It's so fun.
[318:39.16]It's so stupid.
[318:39.82]It's so funny.
[318:40.94]It's fantastic.
[318:48.63]What are you doing?
[318:49.73]Why would you do that?
[318:54.59]Um, uh-oh.
[318:57.58]What the fuck?
[319:02.68]I can't even think.
[319:10.20]You've gotten lots of... I can't.
[319:11.96]I can't.
[319:14.70]Submission?
[319:15.30]Right, submission.
[319:22.40]Make the old man tap right now.
[319:27.08]It's over.
[319:27.82]He's going to tap right here.
[319:32.06]No, it's alright.
[319:32.72]I'll get him with the submission.
[319:40.89]That hurts.
[319:46.79]If I get my special, it's the crazy choke thing.
[319:50.53]Ref, get out of the way!
[319:56.55]Why can't Schmoke ever win?
[319:57.75]Because he's not good.
[320:12.67]Again.
[320:15.03]This is game over for Schmoke.
[320:16.95]I'm sorry.
[320:17.37]This might actually end his career.
[320:27.61]This is it.
[320:29.13]Everybody say goodbye.
[320:34.59]Finishing move.
[320:35.95]Goodnight.
[320:40.33]Oh, that's it.
[320:41.31]That hurts.
[320:41.75]That's incredibly painful.
[320:46.73]That hurts even to look at.
[320:47.63]Folks' profiles suffered considerably.
[320:55.37]Mr. Satan improved a little.
[321:01.06]good I still haven't been signed somebody sign me sign me let's go sign me add new moves to your repertoire no sign me we have to go to an agency I think they approach you we got approached last time
[321:29.50]Oh, here's the, okay, Steps.
[321:32.16]What is Steps?
[321:34.62]Versus Manny Quinn.
[321:38.83]Um, what does Steps mean?
[321:40.59]Is it a Steps match?
[321:42.77]Go to database.
[321:43.65]I don't think I can select any of these.
[321:49.51]Okay.
[322:00.36]You just wait to be recruited?
[322:01.44]These people are lying.
[322:02.60]Okay.
[322:04.10]What does a steps match mean?
[322:05.60]This one actually is in front of people.
[322:06.90]I can make a brutal, uh... I can make a brutal splash here.
[322:10.62]Do we have to build a staircase together?
[322:30.78]Coach Emerson.
[322:36.12]It's very important.
[322:36.80]Do you like cantaloupe?
[322:38.78]Not really.
[322:39.28]I don't.
[322:41.08]Usually I kind of avoid the cantaloupe in a fruit cup.
[322:44.37]And if I still really want to eat it, I'll eat the cantaloupe at the end.
[322:48.11]The melon.
[322:49.39]I usually leave that for last.
[322:54.33]Who am I fighting?
[322:57.49]Mandy Quinn and I are out here for just more than another wrestling match.
[323:02.77]This is a special charity event that will raise money for good causes all over the world.
[323:07.38]So let's hit each other in the head with stairs.
[323:10.56]Those in attendance have already donated.
[323:12.24]I've already done their bit by showing up, so give yourselves a big round of applause.
[323:18.13]We hope you'll be joined by many more watching at home who can also pledge their donation online.
[323:25.92]Enough talking, Manny Quinn.
[323:27.16]Let's give the world a match that's worthy of a big donation.
[323:31.78]What's that?
[323:36.47]Um... Uh... Aren't we supposed to be fighting, Manny?
[323:43.65]Um...
[323:59.06]This is not, this is like bad.
[324:00.92]I don't like this.
[324:08.62]Man, let's put on a big show.
[324:26.82]Hold on, I gotta keep him out there.
[324:33.03]Stay out there.
[324:33.51]Alright.
[324:35.51]I'm trying to hit him in the face.
[324:40.95]What?
[324:53.08]No, I want to throw it at him.
[325:09.75]What are you doing?
[325:12.72]What's wrong with you?
[325:14.22]What's wrong with you?
[325:18.38]What are you doing?
[325:19.44]Why are you like this?
[325:22.10]You do this every single time I'm in a match.
[325:25.14]You're actually like the best person to have in the corner.
[325:28.37]Don't go me.
[325:34.19]Give me that.
[325:35.49]Can I have that?
[325:36.01]Thank you.
[325:50.91]What constitutes a win?
[325:52.37]If he's dead?
[325:53.13]They're booing me!
[326:13.21]I want him to come up here.
[326:14.01]I want to give him a powerbomb through this.
[326:15.29]I need to do something through the table.
[326:22.21]Let's give him a show.
[326:22.99]That's what they want.
[326:25.01]Come up here.
[326:30.70]Come up here.
[326:32.52]Let's give him a show.
[326:35.46]Come up here.
[326:36.14]Let's give him a goddamn show.
[326:37.84]Idiot.
[326:41.64]You idiot.
[326:43.12]You idiot.
[326:44.94]You idiot.
[327:01.14]Oh my god!
[327:02.18]This is... This is not... If this was like a charity event, I'd be like, alright, can they stop doing this?
[327:08.82]This... I don't... This... I don't like this.
[327:16.47]Where did he go?
[327:17.23]He just gets like sucked into the crowd.
[327:22.93]Is he in here?
[327:39.52]He got me in a Boston Crab.
[327:41.22]Okay.
[327:41.58]Hey, it's for charity!
[327:56.69]You're hitting people in the crowd?
[327:57.97]I am not hitting anybody in the crowd.
[328:00.61]Is this thing closed?
[328:04.69]I think this is... This is closed.
[328:09.22]I'm barely balancing on top of this.
[328:10.70]This is a closed ladder.
[328:20.07]Oh, no, it's not.
[328:20.75]It's open.
[328:21.21]Okay.
[328:23.05]I think I have to pin him.
[328:36.73]I don't know why, but for a second I thought that said, take a five minute break.
[328:42.01]Alright, it's time for us to take a break.
[328:51.17]Get the fuck out of here.
[328:56.27]Oh, shit.
[328:59.64]Alright, put him on here.
[329:00.52]I want to, like, get him on the table.
[329:04.02]There we are.
[329:06.78]Oh, fuck.
[329:07.44]Alright, that guy's not gonna get up for a long time, I don't think.
[329:09.73]There's no way I tap out here.
[329:23.42]He's still here.
[329:34.88]Okay.
[329:35.34]Alright.
[329:35.70]Alright.
[329:36.28]I'm pinning him.
[329:37.00]I'm pinning him.
[329:43.00]Alright.
[329:43.36]I'm doing a move and I'm going to pin him.
[329:45.60]I'm going to pin this asshole once and for all.
[329:48.62]It's over.
[329:50.38]Thank you.
[329:50.90]How much did we raise for charity?
[329:53.02]Don't even tell me you're going to get up.
[329:55.22]You piece of shit.
[330:07.40]We raised $100 for charity.
[330:10.91]We raised like $5.
[330:15.83]This guy's covered in blood.
[330:18.13]I can't even say it.
[330:21.94]This guy's covered in blood.
[330:24.02]Covered in blood.
[330:25.86]I don't even care who I'm hitting anymore.
[330:32.26]Holy shit, he dodged it.
[330:37.30]guy we've seen all night that's enough that's it Mike oh my god laughing it's stupid
[331:05.52]John Crockett is currently on the ground.
[331:08.22]Oh, okay.
[331:11.02]We raised almost half a million goddamn dollars for charity.
[331:27.57]Wait.
[331:29.74]Mr. Satan has been booked to face Mike Bale in a handicap hardcore match on the fourth week of October.
[331:38.63]You kidding me?
[331:40.41]Steel cage escape to victory.
[331:43.32]Oh, hell yeah.
[331:44.54]Cage match time.
[331:49.70]Is this for the championship or is this just for an exhibition match?
[331:58.75]Can I get two of the championships?
[332:08.67]I can't.
[332:12.11]I'm sorry.
[332:13.94]Somebody that half a million dollars donated.
[332:16.98]And how much of that is to go to that old man's surgery?
[332:22.10]Reconstruct his entire body.
[332:24.92]God damn it.
[332:30.43]God.
[332:30.89]Dude, you know what I'm going to do.
[332:41.08]It's just so easy.
[332:42.42]It's so easy to just dive into the announcer's table.
[332:47.82]Not right now.
[332:48.44]Give me my mic.
[332:54.11]We're going to talk.
[332:56.45]There's nowhere to run now that I've got you locked inside this cage, Crucial Kennedy.
[333:04.67]Only one of us is getting out of here in one piece and it's not going to be you.
[333:10.30]You're not locked in here with me, I'm not locked in here with you.
[333:12.48]Whatever he says.
[333:17.80]Wait, can... Is this legal?
[333:24.02]I think the mics are legal.
[333:37.98]locking it with your mic.
[333:39.93]This would be hell to listen to in the audience.
[333:42.25]Imagine being the guy that has to wear the headset and listen to this.
[333:47.27]Fuck you.
[333:52.61]Yeah.
[333:53.07]Yeah, right.
[333:53.83]Don't think so.
[333:54.66]Sorry, buddy.
[333:55.66]That ain't happening.
[334:03.06]Let go of me.
[334:05.10]That was cool.
[334:17.50]Did I get him?
[334:24.69]I'm going for it.
[334:27.35]Get out.
[334:27.77]Let's go.
[334:32.25]Come on.
[334:33.61]Oh, what?
[334:34.71]Who did?
[334:35.01]Did he do that?
[334:41.68]What shook the ring?
[334:49.45]Alright, that's a lot of damage.
[334:51.21]That was a lot of damage.
[334:52.81]How are you... Alright.
[334:55.05]Stay down for a second.
[334:59.10]This is it.
[334:59.54]I'm gonna get it.
[335:02.80]What the fuck is happening?
[335:03.90]Am I too heavy to climb out of the cage?
[335:09.54]Excuse me, what was that bullshit?
[335:13.33]What the fuck are you talking about?
[335:23.70]Climb the cage.
[335:26.06]Got it.
[335:36.31]No, don't let him get it.
[335:38.03]I gotta grab him.
[335:42.25]I'm getting out.
[335:47.58]Holy shit, I'm there.
[335:59.67]The champion.
[336:21.34]Oh, this reminds me of, like, The Sims 4.
[336:24.00]With all the mods on it.
[336:25.31]And it was just total nonsense for, like, five straight hours.
[336:29.49]I feel the same way.
[336:30.37]This is insanity.
[336:36.77]It's so funny.
[336:39.13]I still haven't been paid yet.
[336:40.21]Yeah, I have not been paid once.
[336:46.55]Ugh.
[336:49.61]Okay, I have nothing scheduled, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna train.
[336:53.67]I'm gonna train... What should I do?
[336:55.87]Strength or stamina?
[336:57.21]Probably stamina.
[336:59.68]Try to get this 81.
[337:01.66]Alright, I'm good with that.
[337:05.78]Rest.
[337:05.94]It's nearly 1 AM.
[337:20.98]I know, I'm having fun though.
[337:26.26]I'm having a blast.
[337:30.69]Go all in on stamina.
[337:36.29]Okay.
[337:38.91]Hardcore versus Crucial Kennedy, again.
[337:42.21]Alright, well, I just won the belt from this guy.
[337:45.07]Alright, I'm gonna just beat him with the bat until I've hit him.
[337:47.01]That's the plan.
[337:51.15]Oh, all in on strength.
[337:52.09]Yeah, I'm going to try to get to like 90 strength.
[337:55.27]I was just trying to kill him.
[338:14.11]I was just trying to kill him.
[338:16.96]Missed.
[338:22.63]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this hardcore match.
[338:27.50]First allow me to introduce wrestling school's undergraduate champion, Mr. Satan.
[338:34.64]Weighing in at 211 pounds, at six feet we have Crucial Kennedy.
[338:40.69]I'm your referee, Coach Emerson, so let's ring the bell and find ourselves a winner.
[338:50.96]Big fucking mistake.
[338:51.94]This is just like when you're like a level 3 in Warcraft and you just waltz into like the level 60 zone What the fuck were you thinking dude?
[339:09.09]Oh my god
[339:18.55]I'm gonna... I'm getting through this table, too.
[339:20.61]Let's go.
[339:25.57]Weekly WoW reference?
[339:27.85]Yeah, whatever.
[339:33.31]Don't pull me through that.
[339:34.01]Thank you.
[339:39.56]I was gonna say, that was a really risky move.
[339:49.62]Alright, come here.
[339:50.58]I'm putting you through this.
[339:53.30]Get this in a good spot.
[339:54.01]Because I want to do it off the top turnbuckle.
[340:01.23]I want to put him through the table off the turnbuckle.
[340:03.97]You know what I'm saying?
[340:06.37]I've got to get him in the corner.
[340:08.43]Get over here.
[340:09.03]Coward.
[340:12.10]Coward.
[340:13.70]Don't touch that.
[340:14.94]I moved it over there for a reason.
[340:24.59]Stop it.
[340:30.96]Get on there.
[340:34.84]Say good night.
[340:36.20]I'm going to hang you here until the blood drops and then I'm going to have to drop you on your head.
[340:42.70]We didn't even break the table.
[340:44.68]What?
[340:47.11]How the fuck did that happen?
[340:52.67]That hurt me more than him.
[340:53.75]Great.
[341:01.22]Come here.
[341:02.62]I want you in the corner.
[341:03.52]No, in the corner.
[341:06.49]Come here.
[341:14.91]Am I too far away?
[341:15.75]I did it!
[341:21.71]That's exactly what I wanted to do.
[341:30.89]That was pretty sick, actually.
[341:32.23]I too bad we didn't get to see it.
[341:38.35]I did not know you could just fix the table.
[341:40.03]That's pretty interesting.
[341:43.23]Move!
[341:43.76]What are you doing?
[341:44.50]Why are you doing that?
[341:47.04]What the fuck is this guy doing?
[341:49.78]Group Project Mike Bale.
[341:51.36]Why is he in a referee outfit?
[341:58.59]Uh...
[342:07.30]What the fuck are you doing?
[342:08.26]I don't even know why this guy's here.
[342:20.64]What are you doing here?
[342:21.54]Why are you here?
[342:24.66]What are you...
[342:30.60]That guy just waltzed in here and was videotaping like he was on vacation.
[342:33.84]This guy's roleplaying as a referee.
[342:35.60]Why?
[342:35.84]You're not the referee!
[342:43.20]Oh, hit him in the throat.
[342:45.24]You're not the referee, get out of here!
[342:48.50]Yeah, take your belt.
[342:49.68]Take your belt and shove it up your ass!
[342:58.80]I think this guy's lost.
[343:14.99]What is he doing with the table?
[343:17.91]I'm very confused as to why he's doing this.
[343:23.63]Excuse me?
[343:24.73]Excuse me.
[343:28.92]I've ran too fast?
[343:45.25]Alright, I gotta end this.
[343:50.53]Oh shit, sorry coach.
[344:03.12]That's a pin.
[344:12.71]Pin him!
[344:14.66]Wait, he is the referee.
[344:16.32]What is, wait, what's happening?
[344:18.82]Is anybody as confused as I am?
[344:21.26]Why can that guy count?
[344:22.36]He's not the referee.
[344:23.12]The coach is the referee.
[344:25.25]You can't just interfere and be the referee.
[344:27.87]That's not how this works.
[344:32.51]What the fuck is going on?
[344:53.73]Because I thought the coach was a referee.
[344:57.69]Hey, I'm so confused.
[345:03.14]But whatever.
[345:03.58]It's over.
[345:04.54]3, 2, 1.
[345:04.86]Okay, I won.
[345:07.18]What the...
[345:25.18]Thank you!
[345:26.84]Mr. Satan's progress is being hindered by the limitations of wrestling school.
[345:32.47]I need to be called up.
[345:36.09]Should have pinned the ref.
[345:44.40]The entire sport of wrestling has increased the population.
[345:48.24]For 2021.
[345:48.48]Wait, I read that so wrong.
[345:51.88]Here we go.
[345:52.20]Holy shit.
[345:53.30]What?
[346:18.19]$14,300 per week to lose every match?
[346:27.40]Alright, hold on.
[346:30.56]Cannot be terminated prematurely.
[346:33.53]Wins pay- what?
[346:36.05]Health insurance.
[346:40.87]Existing relationships to sign the same deal.
[346:43.05]Promise to be booked as or against a champion.
[346:46.53]Part-time.
[346:47.09]Scheduled to work fewer dates.
[346:51.70]What the fuck?
[346:52.56]How about this?
[346:53.78]I won't sign with a rival promotion?
[346:56.20]Alright, how about this?
[346:57.22]I don't care.
[346:57.58]You can tell me what to do.
[347:01.24]How's that?
[347:03.62]Yes!
[347:03.96]Alright.
[347:05.74]I think we can make that work.
[347:07.39]I don't have to lose every match.
[347:15.13]Thanks for showing up Usain, but I'm afraid we couldn't find a spot for you on the card.
[347:17.95]Does he get fired?
[347:29.12]Nothing scheduled.
[347:30.98]Oh shit, well then let's level up.
[347:32.58]Strength.
[347:40.16]Almost 84.
[347:43.75]Alright, give me my money.
[347:45.01]There we go.
[347:47.97]You scammed your summon?
[347:48.79]What do you mean, worst deal?
[347:49.79]What?
[347:51.67]They said that I have to lose every single match, and I said, I don't care about... Let me... Wait.
[347:59.50]No creative control means they'll make me lose.
[348:01.70]That's worse.
[348:09.21]Not only did I sign...
[348:13.50]I signed a contract where they control literally everything about me, and my concern was I didn't want them to control me losing matches, but I just signed a document saying that they can control everything.
[348:23.79]Including everything, which is matches.
[348:28.83]Where's my lawyer?
[348:30.11]Why was my lawyer in the room?
[348:31.29]Why would I ever sign that with a lawyer?
[348:32.49]Okay.
[348:44.96]Whatever.
[348:45.26]New contract.
[348:48.56]I think I have, like, another two weeks.
[348:54.94]Smoke could not be woken from his sleep this morning.
[349:01.00]Oh, that's not good.
[349:01.84]The 60-year-old veteran is thought to have died of natural causes.
[349:07.28]Oh, my God.
[349:08.10]The industry will come together this...
[349:21.00]I didn't kill him.
[349:22.68]You staged a special tribute.
[349:29.40]In the memory of Schmoke.
[349:33.72]Okay.
[349:36.22]Keep an eye on your progress.
[349:37.06]Think some changes need to be made.
[349:38.30]You're not talented enough to give fans the technical wrestling that they see.
[349:43.26]Get your skill to 82% by November or you're going to have to find a different line of work.
[349:48.94]uh singles versus shane asterisk my skill at now I can get that later um was I the last person he fought isn't this guy that like has me under a bad contract
[350:32.73]I want to sit in the chair and not stand on it.
[350:36.78]Jane Asterisk with Fanny Monaco.
[350:44.92]A fight that killed Schmoke.
[350:46.40]How could you?
[350:47.08]The show is dedicated to the memory of Schmoke, who recently passed away.
[351:00.36]Wait, I'm doing this?
[351:01.98]Schmoke's work in this ring meant a lot to fans, but the person he was backstage meant even more to us.
[351:08.55]Oh my fucking god, get out of the chair.
[351:10.99]Get out of the chair!
[351:20.22]that's not no I couldn't stand up I didn't I thought that was next week I thought that was next week guys you have any idea I thought that was next week I didn't know this was the charity event oh my god oh my god I can't I have to fucking alright whatever I'm gonna fight him I just

[351:55.73]Sitting?
[351:56.21]I didn't mean to sit down, I swear to God.
[351:59.60]I was hitting every button, spamming to get up.
[352:06.52]Oh, that's so bad.
[352:09.54]It's alright.
[352:10.36]Alright, let me... Does anybody have any fucking idea what's going on out there?
[352:17.38]What's happening?
[352:18.32]Why is this happening?
[352:24.20]Oh, drop it!
[352:24.84]Shit.
[352:25.38]That's illegal.
[352:26.72]Why is all this stuff in the ring?
[352:27.98]These guys.
[352:46.77]Alright, let's play.
[352:49.93]Stop playing Rancho Relaxo NG.
[352:52.81]I'm sorry.
[352:58.77]Get out of here!
[353:07.11]He's fighting the fucking ref!
[353:18.73]What are you... Can't lift me.
[353:22.31]Too big.
[353:25.35]I must have my special somehow.
[353:26.51]I don't know how.
[353:29.74]I don't know why, but I thought that guy had a mattress in his hands, and I thought he was trying to make it safer for us.
[353:47.38]Ah, I hit my head on that.
[353:48.28]Alright, whatever.
[353:48.76]Alright, string stuff together.
[353:54.02]Let's go.
[354:00.51]Good.
[354:00.85]He's probably going to go out the ring.
[354:01.73]Never mind.
[354:11.27]Let me go up.
[354:15.97]Who did the move to who?
[354:25.90]I love doing that to people.
[354:29.71]This is it.
[354:31.07]And... Huge.
[354:33.73]Wow, that was into the special.
[354:36.43]This is, um... That's one of the announcers, by the way.
[354:40.53]This lady did not come with anybody.
[354:43.70]Like, I don't know what the fuck you're doing.
[354:45.94]Why would one of the announcers come in?
[354:51.14]What's the point of the announcer?
[354:52.82]You know what?
[354:56.68]I'm just gonna throw a barbell into the crowd and see what happens.
[355:10.86]I dropped it, I'm fine.
[355:19.59]What?! !
[355:42.81]Uhh, from the front.
[355:43.41]Let's do this.
[355:45.99]That was pretty sick and that's probably it.
[355:50.39]The winner!
[355:57.86]Did I get the championship?
[355:58.72]Wait.
[356:15.93]What about my client?
[356:16.99]What about my owner?
[356:18.11]Or my... The owner of the company that I work for.
[356:21.29]Yes, there we go.
[356:23.39]$700,000?
[356:23.43]Where are my wages?
[356:23.97]Don't I get $300 a week?
[356:25.80]Oh.
[356:44.34]I'm talking about the owner of the company.
[356:46.22]Like, that's the owner of the company.
[356:50.06]Mr. Satan has been challenged to increase his skill to 82%.
[356:52.14]I'll get it right here.
[356:56.49]Mr. Satan has been booked to face Snake Suzuki in a red light match on the third week of November.
[357:02.71]What does that mean?
[357:06.97]A red light match.
[357:09.93]The skill has to be 82, right?
[357:12.99]It was skill, right?
[357:14.67]Make sure I get this right.
[357:24.43]I'm going to be really weak for this fight, but I don't even care.
[357:27.09]I have to do this.
[357:27.59]Because I have a day off tomorrow, which I can get it to 82.
[357:31.06]Alright, let's go.
[357:34.80]Is this a singles match?
[357:52.48]Oh, it's just a red light match.
[357:55.66]I know it's not.
[358:10.51]Let's go.
[358:12.43]As I'm sure you're all aware, I'm the reigning Super Junior Champion here at Rising Sun.
[358:16.03]Poor, that was disrespectful throwing my belt.
[358:19.97]Unfortunately, the competition in this division is so pathetic that I've resorted to finding my own.
[358:27.92]That's why I'm pleased to announce that I'll be granting a title shot to whoever wins this match.
[358:34.24]Of course, this is the day that I train.
[358:52.24]Did you just grab me?
[358:53.26]Why'd you just grab me?
[358:53.93]That was not fair.
[358:54.53]I think I can still do it.
[358:56.51]I really do.
[358:56.93]I was gonna play smart.
[359:02.33]Alright, let's play smart.
[359:12.67]Nice.
[359:15.67]He missed.
[359:16.01]Good.
[359:18.14]Go on.
[359:22.00]Taunt, taunt, taunt, taunt, taunt, taunt, taunt.
[359:23.54]Do it again.
[359:23.82]Get out of the way, man.
[359:34.70]What did I do?
[359:35.34]I didn't... I don't know what just happened.
[359:39.98]Who... Ow!
[359:51.49]I gotta equalize this down here.
[359:54.23]Even though it's four seconds, I gotta hit him in the fucking head with the chair.
[359:56.45]Give me that.
[359:59.60]Give me that.
[360:00.42]Get the fuck away from me.
[360:02.80]How can I get counted out?
[360:04.38]Or is he?
[360:05.40]Who's six?
[360:06.82]Am I six?
[360:08.28]Who's seven?
[360:09.84]Is it me?
[360:10.30]I can't get... He's filming this.
[360:14.75]He's stuck.
[360:16.89]Count him out, please.
[360:21.02]God damn it.
[360:24.84]I have to get him out here.
[360:25.80]He has to come out here and I have to kill him.
[360:27.02]I have to beat the fuck out of him with the chair.
[360:30.42]Where's the chair?
[360:32.02]It's out here somewhere.
[360:32.62]Where is it?
[360:41.90]He blocked two hits with the chair.
[360:44.16]I think I lose.
[360:47.36]Yeah, I'm camping.
[360:47.98]Look at my health.
[360:48.81]I started this with no health.
[360:53.41]Put him down and I gotta reset this.
[360:56.43]No, put him... I'm dead.
[360:57.81]He's over.
[361:03.03]He punched me in the balls and he's gonna run away.
[361:04.49]You dick.
[361:08.81]Come on.
[361:10.89]It's over.
[361:12.21]It's over.
[361:13.75]It's it.
[361:17.29]Get me in the ring!
[361:18.30]Get me in the ring!
[361:22.67]Holy shit, I did it.
[361:23.51]Okay, here we go.
[361:35.84]What's wrong with me?
[361:42.66]What's wrong with me?
[361:48.64]I couldn't move.
[361:49.42]He was staring at the stick and he hit himself in the head.
[361:53.53]I didn't do anything.
[361:54.33]I'm so fucking tired.
[362:04.43]Get up!
[362:07.90]Oh, it's over I think.
[362:08.88]I don't think I'm getting up.
[362:13.02]That's sad.
[362:13.78]That's it.
[362:16.64]It's over.
[362:22.37]I literally jammed that stupid stick into my head.
[362:39.39]Where am I?
[362:39.95]Am I still on the ground?
[362:52.19]I'm still on the ground.
[362:53.39]Oh, shit.
[362:55.27]Come on.
[362:55.75]Why?
[362:55.93]What's wrong with my controller?
[362:58.33]I can't press any buttons.
[363:00.65]I think the game broke.
[363:32.06]Mr. Satan's been booked to face Tower of Misawa in a no-ring tag team match.
[363:36.92]Okay.
[363:43.03]Okay, when I hit myself on the head with the stick, it broke.
[363:45.99]The controller doesn't work anymore.
[363:48.15]Let me try replugging it back in.
[363:50.85]I don't know what just happened.
[363:56.25]What just happened?
[364:00.85]What just happened?
[364:06.43]What the fuck just happened?
[364:16.97]What?
[364:20.10]Why did that happen?
[364:20.82]I don't even know what happened.
[364:22.62]I skipped a day?
[364:24.06]How?
[364:27.32]Okay, I've got full health.
[364:28.82]I've got one more day to get to 82.
[364:30.02]This is the red light match versus Snake Suzuki.
[364:46.94]Today is the day?
[364:47.58]Isn't it week three?
[364:49.28]Is it week one, isn't it?
[364:51.06]What day were we on?
[364:55.06]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[364:55.66]Hold on a second.
[364:56.10]What are you talking about?
[365:02.39]Wait, I thought... Didn't I have a day of rest tomorrow?
[365:05.05]And then the exclamation point.
[365:07.33]Isn't that what I need to look for?
[365:15.32]What if I quit?
[365:19.06]Oh, I skipped it.
[365:20.02]Wait, can I quit?
[365:23.66]Oh, thank god.
[365:24.36]Okay.
[365:24.60]We're good.
[365:33.51]Let's go.
[365:46.30]We're probably gonna stop fairly soon anyways.
[365:57.13]We're going to have to find a stopping point.
[366:04.08]My neck right now is way worse than it was four or five hours ago.
[366:11.88]That's a guarantee.
[366:12.96]My legs, shoulder and chest.
[366:16.50]Red light matches means it's red.
[366:17.96]I'm going to end this as fast as I can because I don't like how this looks.
[366:29.50]Is everything... Is anything illegal?
[366:44.33]Grab him.
[366:44.61]Alright.
[366:45.39]Against ropes, let's do a grab.
[366:48.35]I just... Okay.
[366:48.95]Well, whatever.
[366:49.34]I fucked up.
[366:54.68]This is the virtual boy match?
[366:56.22]Yeah, it is.
[366:59.74]Punch him in the face!
[367:00.66]Alright.
[367:09.10]I didn't mean to do that, but it's alright.
[367:10.16]It's effective.
[367:15.82]Just a slight little hip toss to keep the chain wrestling going.
[367:21.62]Oh... I just flipped three times.
[367:31.72]I love doing the running punch moves.
[367:41.38]The crowd is silent.
[367:50.81]Okay.
[367:53.51]Same guy that made hard time.
[367:54.77]You know, I heard of that too.
[367:57.49]I was going to play these games a while ago.
[368:00.96]And then I finally was like, you know what?
[368:02.28]Maybe I'll try it now.
[368:03.95]Well, when I say now, I mean like maybe two or three months ago.
[368:07.35]And I just saw that he was making this remake.
[368:11.53]So I'm like, shit, do I want to play the old one or just wait for him to do the remake?
[368:16.69]And it said it was coming out in only a couple months.
[368:19.01]I was like, well, screw it.
[368:20.19]We'll just wait.
[368:21.21]And here we are.
[368:23.11]And this is a special move.
[368:24.39]Let's see if we can break his neck.
[368:32.41]Our time is literally 10 out of 10.
[368:33.55]You should play it.
[368:34.11]Is that it?
[368:37.12]Tapping?
[368:39.34]Yeah, he's... Oh, no.
[368:52.89]Our time is like this, but it's prison.
[368:55.95]God, I can't even imagine how insane that probably is.
[369:05.79]That was a beautiful move and that's a pin for sure.
[369:07.99]No, it's not.
[369:18.25]So much blood.
[369:18.99]This guy's just trying to get away from me.
[369:25.49]That enough?
[369:41.31]You make an earthquake every time you walk.
[369:42.93]Cover him!
[369:54.85]Ref!
[369:57.55]There it is.
[369:58.09]I can't believe I killed Shmoke.
[370:03.06]I made that guy.
[370:06.54]He's deleted from the game.
[370:07.68]He's gone.
[370:11.95]It's not like, oh yeah, but he's still in the roster.
[370:13.75]No, he's gone.
[370:15.00]He was deleted.
[370:19.28]Yeah, I got my skill points.
[370:22.86]Good.
[370:29.38]Can I buy stuff?
[370:30.22]I have $17,000.
[370:30.42]There.
[370:30.68]There.
[370:40.51]Congratulations, Mr. Satan.
[370:41.51]You followed my advice and made your prospects better than ever.
[370:43.69]Please accept a $1,000 bonus as a reward.
[370:47.41]Just make sure you keep up the good work.
[370:51.43]There's more to this business than what takes place in the ring, Mr. Satan.
[370:54.92]Why don't you join us for a drink to unwind?
[370:57.04]It probably wouldn't cost more than a hundred bucks.
[371:01.04]Well, that's ten drinks.
[371:03.02]Um... But, okay.
[371:06.10]Sure.
[371:08.80]That's like, oh, sometimes 20 drinks.
[371:12.47]Cool, I hope you can handle your beer.
[371:13.95]It'll be good.
[371:20.99]This is not good.
[371:26.65]No ring tag team.
[371:36.38]Butter Monk and Tower Misawa.
[371:47.10]I got him!
[371:47.86]I actually hit him!
[371:48.66]I hit him in the back!
[371:54.74]What are they doing?
[371:56.70]You picked a child out of the crowd for all the good it's going to do you!
[372:06.36]No, weapons are allowed?
[372:07.28]Oh, it doesn't matter if I'm hungover.
[372:10.02]Weapons are allowed.
[372:10.62]Fuck.
[372:15.58]Don't let him.
[372:16.78]Are you serious?
[372:18.76]Who's on my team?
[372:19.56]I don't know who's on my team.
[372:22.96]Again.
[372:23.28]It happened again.
[372:24.68]I don't know who's on my team.
[372:32.51]Who's on my team?
[372:33.73]This guy's a bad guy, right?
[372:45.96]I have to stop that.
[372:46.92]That's my boss.
[372:52.11]That's so stupid.
[372:53.09]I love it.
[372:54.45]I'm so tired.
[372:58.25]Oh, fuck.
[373:02.44]You caught it?
[373:03.24]Fuck.
[373:15.23]Alright, let's work together work together Here we go work together Who's pinning who do we win?
[373:39.37]We're getting smoking
[373:42.96]Are you smoking a cigarette?
[373:46.41]Why can you- Are you smoking?
[373:47.69]Get- Oh, that's my guy!
[374:06.36]We're so close to these people.
[374:11.35]We're so close.
[374:13.97]Like, wouldn't you move?
[374:16.35]Don't you think you would... Don't you think you would... Wait, what?
[374:20.61]We get disqualified?
[374:32.32]What happened?
[374:47.22]You dropkicked the judge?
[374:48.72]They're not a judge.
[374:50.70]That's a commentator.
[374:51.82]That's not the judge.
[374:53.99]This isn't the Olympics.
[374:55.03]They don't hold up signs with a score on it.
[374:58.25]The judge?
[374:58.91]And I count on you to referee one of the matches.
[375:06.86]Alright, this is the last match, and then I'm gonna call it.
[375:08.80]It's getting really late.
[375:10.86]This is the final match of the night.
[375:13.48]720 bucks, I'm referee tonight.
[375:15.76]It's a submission match.
[375:17.80]Oh, that's so funny.
[375:23.79]Like, they were so close.
[375:25.25]Why wouldn't they move?
[375:27.97]Even after I punched that person in the face, that guy just still sat there.
[375:36.42]Oh, I'm gonna have to take a bath tonight.
[375:37.84]I'm seriously gonna be in a... I'm so tired, too.
[375:40.08]Look at my guy.
[375:40.70]This is definitely a bath night, without a doubt.
[375:45.83]Oh my god, my chest and back.
[375:56.03]How am I coming in with him?
[375:56.95]Oh, no, never mind.
[376:09.11]Alright, who do I want to win?
[376:12.11]I'm on the... whose team am I on?
[376:18.98]Okay, I think I'm on their team, right?
[376:29.54]Just to make it look like I didn't... just to look like I'm fair.
[376:47.45]Get up.
[376:52.95]The referee is just on his like sleeping.
[377:02.60]Oh.
[377:03.52]Alright, I'm up.
[377:14.78]I'm up, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.
[377:24.70]I keep being unplugged when they plug me back in I'm just still in crazed mode I didn't change out of that
[377:49.42]Oh, and over his head.
[377:50.44]That would have been so funny.
[377:52.73]Imagine if I hit him right in the mouth and he went backwards.
[377:55.17]Oh my god.
[377:56.49]I would have had to end the stream right there.
[377:58.49]That would have been the end of the stream.
[377:59.67]I would have had to quit.
[378:13.66]You want the guy with the black shorts to win.
[378:14.98]Yeah, I think we're in the same organization, right?
[378:20.51]I'm not doing that much influence.
[378:21.95]I'm just... Every time it looks like he's got the upper hand, I'm gonna hit him.
[378:26.13]We have the same boss.
[378:29.65]Yeah.
[378:29.89]Yeah, when it looks like he's gonna win, I come in.
[378:45.86]Yeah, I'm the ref.
[378:53.02]Should I pin him?
[378:56.55]What happens if I pin my own organization guy?
[379:01.55]No, you got a little too far.
[379:16.64]I have to make it fair, right?
[379:25.15]Hey, we're on the same team!
[379:41.08]I can't... I'm so tired.
[379:48.55]Alright, easy now.
[380:01.43]You want to go for a pin?
[380:02.13]If you pin him right now, I'll count really quickly.
[380:05.75]What the fuck?
[380:17.00]Bring your son to work day.
[380:20.92]I just landed on my neck.
[380:25.30]I'm trying to pin him.
[380:43.97]Get out of here.
[380:49.13]Alright, pin him, pin him, pin him, pin him, pin him.
[380:56.14]I gotta get up here so I can get a better view.
[381:07.88]Hmm.
[381:08.10]Hmm.
[381:12.00]I'm like a baby.
[381:13.16]What am I doing?
[381:14.80]I'm sitting here like biting my nails, just sitting here perched.
[381:31.15]What's that guy doing back there standing?
[381:40.26]Excuse me.
[381:41.04]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out of the ring.
[381:42.95]Out of the ring.
[381:43.57]Out of the ring.
[381:45.79]And your punishment... Get the shit beat out of you with a chair for five minutes.
[382:02.81]How am I missing?
[382:12.61]Alright.
[382:16.49]Can somebody pin someone?
[382:17.67]No one's even attempted to do anything.
[382:33.07]Like, I'm getting bored!
[382:33.99]Somebody do something!
[382:44.89]Somebody do something!
[383:00.56]Ow!
[383:11.77]Get out.
[383:12.31]Get down.
[383:13.71]Get out.
[383:24.53]The boss is on him.
[383:28.83]Alright, I gotta... Oh, right.
[383:36.11]Who's fighting who?
[383:43.37]Wait, I've just received word from Motorola, Chan, that this match must be restarted immediately.
[384:04.35]Just count him out again Alright get back in the ring Get in the ring
[384:34.02]Nice job, everybody.
[384:37.50]Wait, that's my boss.
[384:42.95]Okay, I'm done.
[384:44.03]I'm done.
[384:44.43]I'm done.
[384:45.01]I'm done.
[384:45.41]I'm done.
[384:49.81]Oh, my God.
[384:50.37]I can't laugh anymore.
[384:51.55]I can't laugh like that anymore.
[384:53.17]I can't.
[385:00.43]I can't laugh like that.
[385:02.86]Okay, I'll see you guys later.
[385:05.48]I'm supposed to stream tomorrow.
[385:07.04]Okay, here's the thing.
[385:08.02]We're streaming tomorrow.
[385:09.36]I'm supposed to play this again tomorrow.
[385:12.60]I kind of want to keep going.
[385:14.34]And just play at least for a little while tomorrow.
[385:16.62]If for some reason I wake up tomorrow and I am like a brick person.
[385:22.25]It's very possible that I may have done some damage.
[385:26.83]And we'll just do Monday.
[385:28.17]But tomorrow, you'll hear from me a couple hours before the stream at least.
[385:34.33]Let's see how I get up tomorrow.
[385:35.79]If not, then let's do Monday.
[385:40.92]Listen, my voice is gone.
[385:42.96]Everything is done.
[385:43.54]That was watching the funniest movie I've ever seen.
[385:48.67]And it was like two Lord of the Rings movies back to back of the funniest movie I've ever watched.
[386:01.62]Please don't kill Shmoke.
[386:02.84]He's already dead.
[386:04.74]I can't bring him back.
[386:05.62]Oh my goodness.
[386:08.40]Is this a save automatically?
[386:11.30]I think so.
[386:14.79]I was bashing his face in with a chair and I didn't even... Whatever.
[386:25.09]Oh my goodness gracious.
[386:26.41]Alright.
[386:27.15]I'll talk to you guys tomorrow.
[386:28.29]If not tomorrow, then Monday.
[386:29.85]We'll play this again.
[386:30.57]I feel like I'm having enough fun with this that I want to do this again.
[386:35.30]At least try to get to a higher championship.
[386:37.68]And just see what happens in maybe another few hours.
[386:39.62]We'll see.
[386:42.02]I'll see you guys later.
[386:44.74]Have a great rest of your night.
[386:45.58]We're gonna just throw this over here.
[386:48.21]I believe it should be saved.
[386:51.33]And I'll see you guys soon.
[386:53.99]Actually, I don't want this.
[386:55.95]Because that's, um... Probably DMCA.
[386:58.89]Monday stream incoming?
[387:02.67]I don't know.
[387:03.11]Probably.
[387:06.77]I'll let you know tomorrow before I start.
[387:09.65]Maybe two or three hours before the sus.
[387:11.47]Which will be probably around... Two?
[387:13.11]Three?
[387:14.75]Plan for Monday, but I might just get up and be fine and we can just go at like 2 p.m.
[387:21.14]But yeah, I would plan for Monday.
[387:23.24]Literally every time I've ever said it's going to happen on the earlier day, it's never happened one time in 10 years.
[387:28.98]So I'm pretty predictable at this point.
[387:30.92]That was awesome.
[387:35.08]I loved every second of that.
[387:37.81]Thanks again for the subs.
[387:38.63]There were a lot of subs.
[387:39.37]I missed a lot of them too because I was just sort of completely engrossed in everything going on.
[387:49.20]Don't push yourself.
[387:50.00]No, I'll be okay.
[387:50.76]I... I don't worry.
[387:52.80]I take plenty of time off.
[387:55.18]If I feel like I can't, then I just won't.
[387:59.84]Is this the game of the decade?
[388:02.10]Um... It's definitely one of the funnest... Let's put it this way.
[388:07.72]It's definitely one of the most entertaining games I've played in the last couple of years.
[388:11.18]That's 100% for sure.
[388:18.74]This is going to be a really long second Jerma video.
[388:25.09]It's going to be one of those second Jerma videos.
[388:26.67]It's going to be one of those Jerma985 videos.
[388:30.89]Where it's just the Wii's laughter.
[388:34.93]Cut between Wii's laughter.
[388:37.64]And me progressively getting a more blown out voice.
[388:47.25]Try hard time?
[388:48.95]Once I get my fill of this, we'll see.
[388:51.63]There's a couple... There's... Well, actually, I could tell you this.
[388:53.87]Remember how I broke my Vive controller?
[388:58.96]It actually broke and I couldn't use it anymore?
[389:00.80]It's actually broken.
[389:03.42]Well... I got an index.
[389:08.38]So... We can do that.
[389:14.93]With the knuckle controllers...
[389:17.27]So at some point, probably next week, I would say, we're probably gonna get back into VR and do another VR smorgasbord.
[389:27.30]For a night or two, at least.
[389:28.68]We'll probably do another two-day next weekend, because if I'm gonna do VR, I'm gonna wanna do, like, at least four.
