[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.94]Okay, you've got it.
[00:04.20]You're doing it.
[00:05.10]You must have clicked single player last time.
[00:07.64]Alright, well, it looks like it's being weird.
[00:11.33]Okay, it should be downloading the mods right now.
[00:13.73]I guess it is.
[00:14.23]Am I downloading it from you?
[00:16.43]Yeah, I assume.
[00:24.27]Just a chat.
[00:25.37]The wait will be worth it.
[00:26.55]We're talking Terraria.
[00:29.18]Um, right now I got a bar on my screen that doesn't have any, a list of anything on it.
[00:32.46]It's just like an empty bar.
[00:34.12]Just trust the bar, okay?
[00:35.68]Just don't, I'm just saying, does this happen to you?
[00:37.92]Like, do you have like a, no text on it, the bar's just sitting there, nothing downloading?
[00:41.88]Well, last time me and Ashley played, we both, like, individually downloaded the mods.
[00:49.35]So why didn't you just tell me to download the mods?
[00:51.67]Because this should be easier, and I wanted to reduce the amount of pain that you would be caused, but like...
[00:58.70]You know?
[01:01.38]It should just download.
[01:05.42]It should, I guess.
[01:09.06]But, um, look, I'll show my screen so people can see.
[01:11.98]Hey, everybody, hi.
[01:13.06]Yes.
[01:13.58]Playing Terraria with Star today.
[01:15.08]Switched on TV.
[01:19.38]Oh, no, it's working.
[01:20.22]It's working.
[01:20.62]It's working.
[01:21.76]It's working.
[01:22.20]Installing.
[01:26.55]It's doing a lot of installing now.
[01:29.25]Is it going to show your... Should I make sure I don't... I don't think it shows anything.
[01:34.09]You joined!
[01:35.11]Okay.
[01:35.85]I'm going to squad invite you.
[01:41.23]Hold on, hold on.
[01:41.93]Squad stream?
[01:42.63]You know what?
[01:43.47]We're doing it this time?
[01:44.55]Oh, right, right.
[01:45.19]Okay, yeah, yeah.
[01:47.91]I accept.
[01:50.15]I've accepted your squad invite, sure.
[01:53.49]Alright, so... Okay.
[01:54.85]You press escape to open up your...
[01:57.36]Your thing.
[01:57.98]Can you see the little shields?
[01:59.12]Can you click on the red shield to join my party?
[02:03.62]Brother?
[02:04.04]Little brother?
[02:04.52]I need to see how to jump first.
[02:06.10]Alright, so hit escape.
[02:08.90]And then go to... On the right hand side you got little shield icons.
[02:12.07]There's a red one.
[02:13.39]Little bro.
[02:14.51]Yeah.
[02:15.71]There's a red one.
[02:16.55]These are so small.
[02:18.49]Okay.
[02:20.21]Right there?
[02:20.83]I clicked the red one.
[02:24.35]Oh, there you are.
[02:26.58]Did you make this house already?
[02:28.24]No, this house starts here because of the mods.
[02:31.96]What we have to do... Alright, how do I... Alright, there it is.
[02:39.61]Okay.
[02:39.77]It's just like all these other games.
[02:42.17]It's just like all these other games.
[02:43.39]Okay, you see, it should be... You have a couple things in your inventory.
[02:47.33]Nine and zero.
[02:49.21]Nine and zero.
[02:50.17]I have one, two, and three.
[02:51.55]Your top bar.
[02:52.17]You have one, two, three, four, and it goes all the way to zero.
[02:54.28]Yeah, yeah.
[02:55.42]Take the Ironheart and drop it in the trash can.
[02:58.16]For vengeance, drop it in the trash can.
[03:03.70]What the fuck are you talking about?
[03:05.14]I have annoying Copper Axe.
[03:09.28]Oh, because you made this character without the mods.
[03:12.12]You don't have... Okay.
[03:14.72]Okay, hold on.
[03:15.26]Here.
[03:15.78]Here, take this.
[03:16.52]Who's this?
[03:17.02]Take this.
[03:17.60]Who's Jeffrey?
[03:20.04]You're fine.
[03:20.90]Okay.
[03:22.04]I'm just gonna... Oh, I know this one.
[03:32.46]Magical hammer, what should I do with this?
[03:35.68]Um, it's a hammer.
[03:36.97]You can hit things with it.
[03:37.79]Alright, well, let me just, let me try.
[03:39.79]Watch it out, the boys are coming.
[03:40.97]Should I be, should I get in?
[03:44.97]This is kind of loud.
[03:47.63]I'm just waiting for you to set up your volume.
[03:49.09]You see it's nighttime now, so zombies are gonna come, Jeremiah.
[03:52.99]Okay, so what's happening?
[03:54.25]Is there slime?
[03:55.47]That's mine.
[03:56.23]That's my buddy's slime.
[03:57.47]Alright, so what, what do we do?
[04:01.59]What do we do?
[04:02.23]Yeah.
[04:06.35]First thing, we need to build a bunch of houses because NPCs move into the houses.
[04:09.69]We need to gear up and prepare for our first boss fight, Jeremiah.
[04:12.86]Our first boss fight?
[04:14.52]Yes.
[04:15.38]You don't go fight the Ender Dragon after you download the game?
[04:18.78]Well, there's progression.
[04:22.35]It's like fighting in Dariel or the Cook, Jeremiah.
[04:26.15]I killed... Do I pick this up?
[04:26.97]Alright, let's go.
[04:31.66]It's dark down here.
[04:32.86]It is dark down here.
[04:34.24]Oh, you have torsion.
[04:35.92]Should I be, like, mining?
[04:37.22]Stone block?
[04:39.42]Sure.
[04:39.70]I'm sure, buddy.
[04:41.22]This is pretty damn loud.
[04:42.13]Uh, how do I... Settings.
[04:50.23]I can feel this in my teeth.
[04:51.61]That's how loud it is.
[04:54.88]That's better.
[04:56.76]Yeah, but, yeah, guys are doing Terraria today.
[04:59.48]This is just kind of a... Star's like, yo, let's play Terraria.
[05:02.82]And I'm like, alright, let's play.
[05:09.01]What?
[05:13.53]This is probably the best stream I've ever had.
[05:19.33]Uh, I don't... My internet's fine.
[05:22.52]Everything's fine.
[05:25.30]I'm coming in right now.
[05:32.15]Dude, this is so scuffed, bruh.
[05:37.65]Alright.
[05:38.69]Um, that was weird.
[05:39.83]Was I, like, alt-tabbed for a second?
[05:43.15]Can you not alt-tab in this game?
[05:45.73]You should be fine to do that.
[05:49.01]Alright, so... Give me some, like, general control stuff.
[05:55.29]General control stuff is just escape to open up that, and then you have the one through numbers to hotkey whatever you have put up there.
[06:02.41]I would recommend to have torches up there.
[06:05.15]So how do you make torches?
[06:08.31]I'll give you some.
[06:09.33]I have copper coins.
[06:10.86]Okay, so just hotkey torches.
[06:13.12]Just put them up at like four or something.
[06:15.48]Four is where I put them, so we're brothers now.
[06:17.58]Okay.
[06:18.82]You got some weapons, you can put them up there.
[06:20.72]There's also an auto-sort inventory.
[06:23.30]At the bottom of your inventory, the bottom right, is your trash can where you delete items.
[06:29.34]And then the box next to that you should have, you have to enable auto-trash.
[06:35.12]So if you put something in that trash can, every time you pick it up from now on, it will automatically get trashed.
[06:40.81]Which will save your life later.
[06:43.19]Okay, so let's say if I put stone block in there, it'll just always delete stone block.
[06:47.61]Yeah, but you don't want to delete stone blocks right now.
[06:49.69]Alright, how do I place... Oh, that's how.
[06:52.51]Yeah, everything just goes into the hotkey system, so if you have, you know, stone blocks on four, then you're placing it.
[06:58.25]Alright, cool.
[06:59.87]Alright, should we wait till daytime, or should we go down and look for some, like, treasure chests?
[07:05.16]Let's chop some trees.
[07:06.16]We're gonna need a lot of wood.
[07:10.04]There's no, like, friendly fire, right?
[07:13.70]Uh, no, but you're gonna have to join the red team again.
[07:17.10]Join the red team?
[07:17.90]Oh, okay.
[07:18.78]It, like, shows us where we are.
[07:21.54]Did that do it?
[07:22.68]Yeah.
[07:24.76]Flying Demon Eyes?
[07:26.02]Have you ever played this game, like, ever?
[07:28.50]No, like, not really.
[07:29.22]I think I've opened it, like, a few times randomly, and then that's it.
[07:33.64]We're gonna get you addicted, and then Saturdays are gonna be Ster Sucks Terraria Jerma Saturdays.
[07:39.56]Don't say that.
[07:40.62]What if that's not real?
[07:41.10]This is gonna take over your life.
[07:43.59]Okay, so also when you press escape, you see on the left-hand side, you have a bunch of options.
[07:47.49]Crafting down here?
[07:48.65]Yeah, so wood platforms are very important.
[07:51.53]You hold down right-click to make a bunch.
[07:53.33]You're just turning wood into wood platforms.
[07:55.20]It shows you the recipe.
[07:56.22]Oh, shit.
[07:56.62]Okay.
[07:57.78]And then it's these that you place down.
[08:00.26]So you can like fall through these, but also... Do they have to be connected?
[08:04.60]Or can I just make them like in the air?
[08:07.10]They have to be connected to something.
[08:08.58]Or if there's a back wall, you can place it on a back wall.
[08:14.44]I really did not know you didn't know anything about thrower.
[08:17.64]I thought you had like a base.
[08:19.42]No, I mean, I knew it was craft.
[08:21.91]I just made like a hundred of these.
[08:22.97]Where'd they go?
[08:26.67]Where'd my wooden platforms go?
[08:31.03]I don't know.
[08:33.39]That's weird.
[08:36.98]That was a pretty cool piano sound.
[08:40.31]Did I drop them?
[08:41.93]Did you pick those up, didn't you?
[08:44.00]Yeah.
[08:49.56]You threw them away, and I have them, is what Chad's saying.
[08:51.86]Oh, alright.
[08:53.06]Well, here.
[08:53.44]I made them for you.
[08:53.98]Here's some.
[08:55.22]Thanks.
[08:57.18]This inventory is junk, so let me move some stuff out of the way.
[09:05.16]Wait for you, little bro.
[09:08.82]Alright, how do you heal?
[09:09.54]Is there, like, a food system in the game?
[09:11.46]You heal over time on certain... Well, actually, there's healing potions.
[09:16.48]You won't have any.
[09:17.40]And then you just press H to auto-heal if it's in your inventory.
[09:20.25]I'll give you some.
[09:21.31]Okay, when do we start digging to health?
[09:24.31]Not yet.
[09:24.69]Okay.
[09:27.69]So what would you consider is a good amount of wood that we have?
[09:33.34]We're good.
[09:33.72]I have, like, 300.
[09:37.43]We're good, man.
[09:38.53]We're good.
[09:40.11]Should we go down?
[09:41.03]What is this?
[09:42.41]How do I delete the quest thing?
[09:46.18]Ignore it.
[09:46.64]Just move it out of the way.
[09:47.66]You can drag it.
[09:48.20]Okay.
[09:56.52]I want to go find a desert.
[09:58.00]Dig straight down, you coward.

[11:10.77]Put torches on one.
[11:11.71]You're really gonna put torches on one?
[11:16.91]I am.
[11:17.69]This guy is really going to put torches on one.
[11:20.79]What's wrong with that?
[11:21.61]Is that not okay?
[11:24.81]Wand of sparkling.
[11:26.13]I don't know what any of this stuff is, man.
[11:30.67]You brought me into... I've never had ice cream before in my whole life.
[11:35.53]And you brought me into a Baskin Robbins that has like 500 flavors.
[11:39.97]And you tell me to try every one.
[11:41.91]And I'm like, holy shit.
[11:42.49]Surely you've had a flavor before, though.
[11:45.03]I've never had flavors before.
[11:51.25]What is blueberry?
[11:52.45]I don't know what that is.
[11:53.25]Let me try it.
[11:54.45]Why did I put that there?
[11:56.23]I don't know.
[11:56.61]You, like, really want this to be, like, the brightest place.
[12:01.35]I can't.
[12:01.71]I'm telling you.
[12:02.19]I'm having trouble seeing.
[12:06.45]Is there a mana?
[12:06.91]Oh, there is a mana bar, isn't there?
[12:08.77]Yeah.
[12:13.86]So, hey, what's your preferred playstyle?
[12:15.54]Like, are you a mage?
[12:16.18]Are you a fighter?
[12:17.14]What are you into?
[12:19.80]What's the one that wears glasses?
[12:21.42]Because I can't see.
[12:27.51]You're going to die, dude.
[12:28.67]I'm going to die?
[12:29.35]I gave you potions, I thought.
[12:33.11]Okay, it's daytime.
[12:34.39]Press H. H. Oh, there you go.
[12:39.41]This is my favorite song.
[12:41.37]This song is great.
[12:44.75]Knife?
[12:45.03]Alright, so you want to go find a desert?
[12:48.59]Yeah.
[12:49.43]Change the resolution to make the game bigger.
[12:51.05]I mean, I have it on 1920 by 1080.
[12:52.71]Should I not do that?
[12:54.00]You can also press the plus and minus to zoom in and out.
[12:58.51]There we go.
[12:59.35]That's much better.
[13:00.31]That's so much better.
[13:02.46]Yeah, that's ta- Okay.
[13:04.48]I can put the glasses on.
[13:05.50]Thank you.
[13:06.98]You're the eye doctor.
[13:08.58]I can't- I couldn't- Okay, good.
[13:15.94]I'll take them.
[13:16.74]I'll take the prescription.
[13:18.52]Let's go the other way.
[13:28.38]Should we go down?
[13:31.26]Down?
[13:31.86]No.
[13:33.24]This is not a game where you go down.
[13:36.27]It is a game where you go down, but not yet.
[13:38.03]Not yet.
[13:39.63]Zoomed out mode is best.
[13:40.61]Yeah, well, I'm going to train my eyes.
[13:42.31]The more comfortable I get inside the game, I will zoom out a little.
[13:52.28]There are bosses that are going to kill you for being zoomed in.
[13:56.50]Just for now.
[13:57.36]Let him play at his own pace, okay?
[14:00.03]Thanks.
[14:01.13]Just let him relax.
[14:02.49]This is less Minecraft, more Dark Souls.
[14:11.59]Okay, he's not bored enough yet to do the I fell in that hole joke.
[14:14.90]That's a good sign.
[14:15.74]No, it's been enough.
[14:17.70]It's been enough time.
[14:18.96]What is this?
[14:19.48]Gold?
[14:21.38]Tin.
[14:22.00]Just follow me.
[14:25.11]I want it.
[14:26.33]You know, stop every time you see some fucking tin.
[14:30.90]Maybe.
[14:31.48]Is it worth getting?
[14:32.26]Not really.
[14:35.30]Zoom the UI too.
[14:36.62]Wait, that's true.
[14:37.76]I can do that?
[14:42.46]I can zoom in the UI?
[14:50.33]Here, here's some potions.
[14:52.57]Whoops, I drank it.
[14:54.07]You drank potions, okay.
[14:55.99]It was an accident.
[15:02.37]I can heal you now.
[15:03.33]Everything is great.
[15:06.20]Okay, that's a little better.
[15:08.99]I'm just playing the iPad version, the one that has everything bigger.
[15:11.96]Oh, check this out.
[15:12.76]Here's a tutorial moment.
[15:14.52]So you have your pickaxe, and obviously you're going to click these little walls, right?
[15:17.28]Yeah.
[15:18.54]You press Alt, and you see how there's a yellow marker?
[15:22.21]Alt.
[15:23.27]You just press Alt one time.
[15:25.52]I did.
[15:26.12]And it creates like a yellow block.
[15:27.64]Okay, so just aim forward, like put your mouse on the left side of the screen.
[15:31.42]Yes.
[15:31.80]And then when you hold left click, it'll auto dig you forward.
[15:34.30]So you don't have to individually click each block, but you still have to like walk forward.
[15:38.28]I'm not getting the yellow thing you're describing.
[15:40.18]Press Alt again.
[15:41.31]It's Control, by the way.
[15:44.73]Is it default?
[15:46.09]No, mine's on Alt.
[15:47.23]Whoops, sorry, guess don't listen to me again.
[15:52.59]Now look, we're working together.
[15:54.13]Why is the last two games we've played together mining games?
[15:59.93]Have you noticed that?
[16:03.35]Watch out, behind us.
[16:09.88]We played that, uh, Deep Rock Galactic.
[16:12.38]Oh no, we played, uh, Viscera.
[16:18.21]Well, we kinda did.
[16:19.39]You... You like, disappeared.
[16:22.19]You looked at the painting for too long.
[16:23.37]Alright, let's go.
[16:32.79]I got tin.
[16:35.01]I'm fucking... So, we're looking for a desert.
[16:39.24]You wanna do a desert?
[16:39.92]We need this.
[16:40.44]We need... This is iron.
[16:41.70]There's something... Oh, lead.
[16:43.04]Same thing.
[16:43.92]Alright, you just... You just murdered that squirrel.
[16:48.28]Screw it.
[16:49.64]Dirt?
[16:50.09]Was it leadstone?
[16:51.63]What's the hierarchy here?
[16:53.51]What's the tier list for ores?
[16:56.39]What's 10 on that?
[16:58.17]The tier list for ores is we probably really only need lead.
[17:03.00]Here's the desert.
[17:04.30]What's 10 on that one?
[17:05.14]10 is non-existent.
[17:10.84]Oh, it does a thing to your screen too, doesn't it?
[17:15.58]Okay, Jerma, this is our new home.
[17:17.42]This is where we're going to live.
[17:18.82]Hey, we're already used to that.
[17:22.08]Alright, here's what you're going to do.
[17:23.58]Help me flatten this ground.
[17:26.30]Alright, so flatten it out.
[17:29.85]Flatten it out.
[17:31.13]Because we need to build a home because in Terraria, when you have homes, people show up.
[17:37.85]Uninvited.
[17:39.65]Uninvited, but they're very important NPCs.
[17:42.23]Should I fill this hole?
[17:46.00]Sure.
[17:46.48]You know, just make it look nice.
[17:47.72]You know, use some of your creativity.
[17:49.42]Okay.
[17:51.54]Um, it's dirt, right?
[17:52.65]Or is it sand?
[17:56.99]Uh, it's sand.
[17:57.55]There's a giant hornet over here.
[17:59.71]That scared the shit out of me.
[18:00.67]Help me.
[18:02.37]Shoot it!
[18:07.93]Whoa!
[18:08.61]Alright, that was cool.
[18:12.01]Now it's all dirty.
[18:12.75]We have to move somewhere.
[18:14.78]It's...
[18:15.77]it'll go away okay it goes away how are you throwing these knives that's so cool alright hold on hold on hold on let me get the dirt in here so how do you just this is not dirt how do I take it back I put it back in my inventory
[18:44.72]uh you should auto be oh yeah just delete it again okay sand block sand block sand block alright so now I can I just fill this how far how big do you want the house this is way too big uh we're eventually we're going to be like a metropolis what it's going to be big it's got to be big Jerma
[19:14.13]This is the most boring part of Terraria, and you need to get it done quick.
[19:18.78]So, from you to me, that's not big enough.
[19:23.82]It'll do for now.
[19:24.70]In real life, if this was scaled, this would be like a 2,500 square foot house.
[19:30.44]It's not big enough?
[19:32.00]This is big enough.
[19:33.10]For now.
[19:34.74]For now, Joe.
[19:35.50]I'm trying to... There we go.
[19:43.48]So I'll lay the foundation down to here.
[19:45.90]It's just like I have to do this and I don't know what to tell you to do while I'm doing it.
[19:50.10]You know?
[19:51.08]What about that slime?
[19:52.06]I'll get it.
[20:00.03]Got it.
[20:00.25]You got it.
[20:02.13]Where's my wood?
[20:04.39]Where is your wood?
[20:05.51]Wood.
[20:05.83]Right here.
[20:06.07]Alright, so I'm gonna do... What about... Watch out for your little... I don't want your little guy to get hurt.
[20:12.19]Do I need wooden block?
[20:15.81]Uh-oh, another Hornet.
[20:16.71]He can't get in, though.
[20:18.31]We're protected.
[20:19.05]Okay, we're building slave encampments, by the way.
[20:24.41]I hope you're okay with that.
[20:32.85]Press control again?
[20:38.80]Turn off auto-mine.
[20:41.12]Oh, yeah, you have to press control.
[20:42.30]Control also auto-places blocks.
[20:45.48]Oh, right.
[20:46.90]Alright, so how do you want to do this?
[20:49.74]What did you just say we were doing?
[20:51.86]What?
[20:52.64]What are we building here?
[20:55.02]Let me do one.
[20:56.98]Let me just do one.
[20:58.34]Watch out for the chicken.
[21:00.98]Ignore the chicken, Jerma.
[21:02.14]Stay focused.
[21:02.76]There's too many enemies to look at.
[21:06.16]Too many flavors.
[21:06.84]I've never had blueberry turkey before.
[21:10.91]You might need to get more wood.
[21:12.39]You know what?
[21:12.75]I'm sending you on a fucking wood errand run.
[21:14.81]Got it.
[21:15.01]Tell me what to do.
[21:17.03]Here, hold on.
[21:18.16]Go get wood?
[21:18.60]Go to the right.
[21:19.12]Go to the right.
[21:19.94]Go to the right.
[21:20.34]There's no wood that way.
[21:21.18]Go to the right.
[21:21.64]Just get as much wood as you can, Jerma.
[21:23.56]Hold on.
[21:23.94]I've got to prepare it.
[21:25.10]Hold on.
[21:29.06]So I'm going to get my... Did these degrade over time?
[21:33.10]No.
[21:33.24]The tools?
[21:33.60]No.
[21:34.10]Okay.
[21:35.35]That would be a bad game.
[21:38.37]Would it?
[21:38.61]Yeah.
[21:39.59]Yeah.
[21:40.55]Unanimously, if your tools degrade it, and if every single time Link swung his sword, it broke, that would be a bad game.
[21:47.78]You need to not use that weapon.
[21:49.82]It's that bad?
[21:55.40]How many times can I fire this?
[21:57.12]Okay, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma.
[21:58.30]Oh, wait, no, you can't do that yet.
[22:00.48]Just go get wood.
[22:01.16]I'm going to get wood.
[22:02.22]Where's my... Okay, my health is up there.
[22:04.82]Alright, how much wood do you want?
[22:06.96]Just so much.
[22:13.09]Wait, so people are freaking out that there's a present over there?
[22:15.05]Hold on.
[22:22.35]Did you get it?
[22:25.02]Uh, you probably did.
[22:27.44]Open present.
[22:28.22]Open present.
[22:29.26]Oh!
[22:30.54]Wait!
[22:42.65]This game's fucking pretty fun.
[22:45.15]Alright, open the present.
[22:47.75]Right click.
[22:50.93]Candy cane walk.
[22:53.17]Can I- can my room be the candy cane room?
[22:55.75]Yes.
[22:56.17]Okay, thank you.
[22:58.06]If you bring me the candy canes, I'll make you a candy cane room.
[23:04.16]Really roleplaying this little brother role very, very intensely.
[23:09.78]There's like a big pig over here too.
[23:13.54]I'm almost out of mana.
[23:22.66]I am out of mana.
[23:27.44]There's like EXP in this game, right?
[23:29.44]God damn it, dude.
[23:36.40]Oh, kind of, yeah.
[23:39.78]So should I be making like a stone pickaxe or no?
[23:44.52]No.
[23:50.92]What do you mean no?
[23:51.46]Isn't that how every single one of these games works?
[23:56.30]Why is, hey chat, why isn't this valid housing?
[23:59.54]What did I do wrong?
[24:04.20]Unless something changed.
[24:05.62]That's so big, it's supposed to be 10.
[24:12.03]Alright.
[24:12.51]How much wood?
[24:12.97]I got a lot of wood.
[24:13.71]I have 114.
[24:13.99]That is way bigger than me.
[24:15.47]A door.
[24:16.21]Oh, I don't think I have a door on the whole building.
[24:17.69]That's probably what it is.
[24:21.68]So, give me a number.
[24:22.70]No, you don't need doors.
[24:25.30]When can I turn this quest in to Ster the NPC over there?
[24:32.02]It should tell you what's wrong.
[24:32.96]It's just saying it's not valid.
[24:36.09]But it is.
[24:36.91]Am I wiping out, like, the whole forest here?
[24:39.85]Should I be planting seeds?
[24:47.14]No Fuck nature No, hey I feel like I should be planning stuff So Hey guys Anything else?
[25:11.92]No, not really
[25:19.34]I have done this so many times.
[25:20.72]Uh-huh.
[25:22.80]And it has never not been valid housing, Jerma.
[25:27.25]Do you understand?
[25:29.77]How can you?
[25:30.25]Alright.
[25:30.69]There's a super dragon here now.
[25:32.25]Like, this is going very well.
[25:34.39]How much wood do you want?
[25:35.07]Is 252 wood enough?
[25:37.81]Just keep getting wood.
[25:38.97]What?
[25:40.37]No, you're fighting a super dragon, and I don't even... You're just gonna keep me on the... I am one of your, like, peons in Warcraft.
[25:47.46]You get to play the game.
[25:48.92]I have to just hit the fucking tree.
[26:00.98]Just gonna make it one bigger, I guess.
[26:06.38]I'm just waiting for like 25 more of me to show up behind me and hit the tree with the pickaxe.
[26:14.27]That always ended up happening.
[26:15.15]That happened to you too, right?
[26:16.33]Whenever you were playing like Warcraft 2 or Warcraft 3.
[26:20.33]Never.
[26:20.79]That was never me.
[26:22.16]You never just like click and dragged your whole screen and put every single peon or peasant on cutting trees?
[26:29.72]Jerma, you need to come back.
[26:31.98]I just... I was on the way.
[26:34.27]You told me.
[26:35.01]Come back.
[26:35.45]No, come back.
[26:36.09]Come back.
[26:38.11]There's a whole housing issue.
[26:41.25]I have 450 wood.
[26:42.75]That's not enough.
[26:43.40]And I don't know what is.
[26:45.32]Wait, there's extra wood over here.
[26:46.22]Just make a regular room.
[26:47.00]This is a regular room, chat.
[26:50.70]See, I'm recycling.
[27:01.71]It's getting dark.
[27:02.37]I am coming back.
[27:02.95]Alright, if I have 460... Can I eat the apples?
[27:06.53]That's a lot of apples.
[27:10.45]People are screaming at me to plant the acorns and you told me no.
[27:12.61]Alright, how do I give stuff?
[27:15.17]That's what I had it at originally.
[27:17.03]Twelve.
[27:17.55]Holy shit, this room sucks.
[27:20.05]You can't be in this room.
[27:21.87]What?
[27:22.95]This is a chair and a table and two giant Indiana Jones walls that are going to crush you.
[27:27.56]I don't want to live here.
[27:28.70]That's your room.
[27:30.42]Isn't all...
[27:34.67]Watch out.
[27:36.23]Watch out, this is like an air squid.
[27:37.51]Watch out!
[27:40.47]Get out of there!
[27:41.15]I'm having a freak out moment.
[27:42.19]Get out of there!
[27:43.17]You're gonna get killed.
[27:45.44]Get back inside.
[27:47.20]Quick, go down.
[27:48.60]Go down the top of the chimney in my safe, not Indiana Jones room.
[27:53.06]I promise I won't crush you.
[27:59.27]Did you activate a wave in like Gears of War?
[28:01.51]What the fuck is happening?
[28:02.31]No, it's just nighttime.
[28:07.09]I'm out of mana.
[28:10.24]They can't get up here, right?
[28:16.47]Holy shit, your slime guy's really good.
[28:19.63]It doesn't matter how many torches a room has.
[28:22.25]If it has one, it's good.
[28:23.91]You guys are just, like, making the most insane shit up right now, and I'm going to just start beating you.
[28:30.29]What the fuck?
[28:31.67]How do you open doors?
[28:34.23]Oh, he can cast spells.
[28:37.28]He can cast spells, but he can't open a damn door.
[28:39.56]Alright.
[28:43.46]There's no wall missing!
[28:49.74]This is the worst day of my life.
[28:51.46]I think it's actually- I'm having a good time.
[28:53.38]This is, like, fun for me.
[28:56.50]I mean, this is- I'm really actually enjoying it.
[29:01.19]There's no door.
[29:01.97]There's no roof.
[29:04.69]We need a roof.
[29:10.01]This is- I like this.
[29:11.17]This is fun to me.
[29:13.22]You're having- you're, like, panicking right now.
[29:15.36]I'm just, like, I'm enjoying it.
[29:16.16]You're just hanging out.
[29:22.29]Hey, here's what you do.
[29:23.55]Press escape, go down the workbench down there.
[29:26.45]Do not let this guy in.
[29:27.50]This guy's a piece of shit.
[29:28.90]Don't let him die.
[29:30.32]He's coming in.
[29:31.38]He's coming in.
[29:34.26]He's in the room.
[29:35.78]Crush him.
[29:36.54]Quick, squish him in the Indiana Jones room.
[29:40.05]I'll get him.
[29:44.15]I got him.
[29:45.49]Alright, should I get his head?
[29:51.80]Watch out.
[29:55.63]Okay, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma.
[29:56.67]Come here.
[29:57.63]Next to the bench.
[29:58.99]I want to give you this thing.
[30:00.31]How do I hand you items?
[30:02.65]You pick it up from your inventory, then you right-click to throw it.

[30:49.34]Is it okay if I don't color in the lines?
[30:51.50]Please color in the lines.
[30:55.94]It takes a very long time to remove them.
[30:58.34]What?
[30:58.76]What do you mean?
[31:00.31]It's a pain in the butt.
[31:02.47]Okay, it's kind of hard to do this.
[31:04.05]Oh, control, right.
[31:14.71]Yeah, the control thing should auto-fill as well.
[31:18.80]Is that a firework?
[31:19.72]Yeah, I leveled up.
[31:22.69]My summoner proficiency.
[31:29.21]The absolute speed.
[31:40.24]And the bottom two?
[31:43.44]Everything, the whole thing.
[31:48.58]He's muted.
[31:49.30]He muted himself.
[31:50.39]Is he still talking to me?
[31:51.83]I'm just going to say yes.
[31:52.51]I'm talking to everyone who's going crazy mad at me because they think I'm doing something wrong.
[31:58.89]Oh, you know what?
[31:59.35]I can tell you.
[32:00.17]I am in a great position right now.
[32:03.65]This is all you.
[32:05.23]I'm just building walls and you know things.
[32:07.96]People know things in your chat.
[32:12.26]I just live in your house right now.
[32:21.63]Like, when the toilet breaks in your house, like, I don't call the repairman.
[32:24.90]This housing is suitable.
[32:25.70]You do.
[32:25.92]Hey, anyone who said I needed a door, go fuck yourself.
[32:36.72]You apologize right now.
[32:38.30]I'm having a good time.
[32:48.35]It is, like, fun.
[32:51.19]I'm making these platforms so you can remove that extra accidental ceiling.
[32:55.77]What do you mean?
[32:57.55]The one up here?
[32:57.99]You need to pickaxe that ceiling.
[32:59.69]That shouldn't be that way.
[33:00.85]Pickaxe the ceiling.
[33:03.11]Yeah, remove the wood ceiling that's there.
[33:05.56]You understand?
[33:06.04]You want me to get rid of this ceiling?
[33:10.24]The bottom butt.
[33:12.74]Yes.
[33:13.20]The bottom part of the butt.
[33:15.00]This needs to look perfect.
[33:16.34]Otherwise, no one's going to want to live here.
[33:20.59]These platforms could be a little better, but you know what?
[33:23.21]I'm not going to say anything about it.
[33:24.93]The platforms are being removed.
[33:26.01]They're just so you can stand on them, Jerma.
[33:27.82]It's like a ladder.
[33:28.52]You ever use a ladder before?
[33:29.82]You short mother... Yeah, you can say, you can say, fuck, you know.
[33:37.62]You're in trouble.
[33:39.30]This isn't, this isn't a Jerma insert.
[33:44.20]I was, I was as tall as you in that one picture that people refer to.
[33:51.31]I was like, what do I do?
[33:54.67]You just wait for me.
[33:55.79]What?
[33:55.97]Alright, so what is Mysterio doing over here?
[34:00.36]What is that?
[34:00.76]Mysterio.
[34:02.58]Holy shit, are you really?
[34:10.73]Unbelievable.
[34:11.53]You want me to get rid of this one too?
[34:12.53]What do you mean you're going to die again?
[34:17.07]The mod adds these early game robbers with, like, pistols that just, like, instantly kill you.
[34:23.09]Put shoe on head or pre-recorded.
[34:24.67]Alright, where's a shoe?
[34:26.13]Can I put a shoe on my head in the game?
[34:28.92]Am I safe in here?
[34:30.82]Yes, you're safe, Jeremiah.
[34:31.98]Just don't open the door.
[34:32.88]But, like, it's like, don't press the button, and I'm about to.
[34:35.26]Don't press the button.
[34:37.16]I'm gonna go talk to Mysterio.
[34:38.16]Alright, I'll finish this.
[34:51.39]I would not want to live here.
[34:56.98]Go talk to Mysterio.
[35:05.04]Uh, we need more walls.
[35:08.88]Okay.
[35:10.26]Somebody said mine straight- Yeah, can I, like, just mine straight down?
[35:13.68]And have, like, a little basement thing?
[35:16.97]Um, there's something I want you to do before we do that.
[35:19.79]Then, here, this is very important before I can set you free.
[35:22.89]Sure.
[35:25.63]Can you right-click that?
[35:26.53]Does it say spawn point set?
[35:28.43]No.
[35:30.25]Uh, if I right-click it, it does nothing.
[35:32.23]Now?
[35:33.70]Spawn point set.
[35:35.04]Okay.
[35:36.06]Now you can dig straight down.
[35:38.76]Dig straight down.
[35:41.84]Is that smart, though, or is that just gonna be, like, a comedy moment?
[35:45.73]um what I would actually recommend doing is once night ends you know how you can press m and it opens the map yeah there are some tunnels that go down not this desert one don't do this one but like we pass some you can start exploring those caves and if you find chests chests have uh special items in them um what I will also give to you can you sell stuff in this game or should I just start trying like what what should I not be holding on to
[36:14.00]Uh, like random flowers you've picked up are probably useless.
[36:17.83]How do I sell them?
[36:18.53]Just, do I, just trashing them sell?
[36:22.17]Uh, we need NPCs to show up before we can sell things.
[36:27.95]Why is clicking this just making it brighter?
[36:31.27]Oh, never mind.
[36:36.36]Uh, I have a wrath element.
[36:41.15]Should I be holding blood?
[36:42.11]How do I hold blood in my pockets?
[36:44.55]Anything that you're not sure that you need, just dump in there.
[36:47.53]Just dump all your garbage in that box.
[36:49.30]Okay.
[36:49.60]Is there a way to dump all?
[36:51.66]No.
[36:54.24]Oh, well.
[36:57.60]Gotta keep that tin.
[36:59.52]Is there like a shift click or something to make it so it goes?
[37:02.43]Do I have to click and drag?
[37:05.55]Okay, there we go.
[37:12.73]Blood droplets?
[37:14.69]Victory shards.
[37:15.77]Yeah, you're gonna have to sort through this.
[37:27.92]I've never played this really before, but I know for a fact that these seashells should not be put in here.
[37:35.02]Or I'm in there.
[37:38.99]Deposit all.
[37:41.04]I thought, wait, what do you mean deposit all?
[37:45.24]You just told me I couldn't do deposit all.
[37:46.56]Everyone's screaming at me.
[37:50.21]I'm sorry, I didn't say it, but Star was just telling me I couldn't do that.
[37:53.65]I didn't think you could.
[37:55.11]I don't know why you would want to do that, because usually you have inventory that you need.
[37:59.91]I would have taken a look.
[38:02.99]Okay.
[38:05.64]So, I'm going to... Do you want to go into a cave?
[38:10.49]You want to go together?
[38:11.91]Okay, yeah.
[38:12.77]Let me finish this room.
[38:14.95]Let me get some stuff.
[38:16.97]Let me redo this.
[38:18.15]How do you make torches?
[38:20.71]You need gel and wood platforms.
[38:24.77]What's in the bombs?
[38:28.55]33 torches?
[38:30.07]That's good.
[38:31.63]You'll also find a lot from going down there.
[38:34.23]What about a better sword or something?
[38:35.89]How do I do that?
[38:38.22]We really don't have any.
[38:40.89]anything yet what about these flaming arrows I'm making these you know you know what we can go do potions hey guys how do you make rope normally all I remember is oh alright I got my candy cane rolls never mind I usually just make cobweb stuff but we haven't done that yet come left
[39:07.87]Here's the play.
[39:08.41]We're going to get good items fast.
[39:10.29]Do you like having good items?
[39:12.07]I guess, but I wasn't really ready.
[39:13.19]I got flaming arrows.
[39:15.89]I have ten flaming arrows.
[39:17.15]I got my magic wand thing.
[39:23.16]Somebody said there's a funny joke I can do.
[39:24.76]There's always a funny joke you can do.
[39:27.28]Sell everything to Calvin.
[39:30.84]Does that mean anything to you?
[39:33.10]No.
[39:38.57]Unless our big merchant's name... Oh, yeah, he just showed up.
[39:42.53]The merchant where you can sell stuff showed up.
[39:48.04]Here, take this.
[39:50.52]It increases your maximum mana.
[39:53.02]Ooh.
[39:53.64]So is there... Besides... I want to be the mage.
[39:58.16]Okay.
[39:58.56]So at nighttime, falling stars drop from the sky, and if you combine three of them, you make one of those.
[40:03.08]Really?
[40:03.84]So you're going to want to collect those until you get max mana.
[40:06.26]There's a little pot down here.
[40:11.04]Dude, just trash that sword.
[40:12.58]I never want to see you use it again.
[40:15.39]But I need it for little stabs to break through.
[40:19.67]What is this, honey?
[40:27.75]What's up there, tin?
[40:30.19]That's lead, which we will need.
[40:34.22]Who's hitting me?
[40:35.26]There's a green slime blending with the world over here.
[40:37.65]Oh.
[40:39.25]So, okay, what's the dirt equivalent in Minecraft?
[40:41.35]Oh, I need to reach something.
[40:42.47]Just build, build, build.
[40:43.39]Who cares?
[40:44.13]Is it just dirt?
[40:46.37]Wood platforms or ropes if you have them.
[40:48.53]You can climb up this.
[40:50.23]You can.
[40:53.71]Oh, damn.
[40:56.19]Who's Dias the Demolition?
[40:58.27]Dias the Demolitionist.
[40:59.63]He's the guy that sells us bonds.
[41:06.14]I gotta go talk to that guy.
[41:09.05]I'm leaving you alone for a second, little Timmy.
[41:19.08]And Seachat?
[41:20.91]He's in prison.
[41:22.39]He's not going anywhere.
[41:36.88]Eat Slime?
[41:37.52]Alright, I need to... get up here.
[41:42.87]LOL Fuck!
[41:53.57]Got it!
[41:55.87]Eat Star!
[41:56.73]Eat Star!
[41:57.43]Eat Star!
[41:58.11]Eat Star!
[41:58.71]They want you to eat me?
[42:02.97]Eat Star!
[42:05.84]Oh!
[42:07.60]Oh, the mana star I gave you.
[42:08.84]Yeah, you have to actually use it.
[42:10.82]Like, pick it up and left click outside of your... Ooh.
[42:16.98]Ooh.
[42:17.28]Alright, I'm going down here.
[42:19.78]No, no.
[42:21.58]I need you.
[42:23.42]You need me, okay.
[42:24.48]I do need you.
[42:27.86]Actually, maybe we could go down the tunnel if we see another before we find the thing.
[42:32.79]The thing?
[42:43.20]That's pretty good.
[42:44.60]Yeah.
[42:45.76]Pretty good, dude.
[42:47.70]I'm gonna sneeze, and I can't do anything about it.
[42:56.40]Why would I kill the duck?
[43:00.14]Uh, you cannot swim.
[43:01.71]Make sure you don't fall down that hole.
[43:03.21]What do you mean I cannot swim?
[43:05.13]Am I made out of concrete?
[43:06.03]Yeah.
[43:06.93]What?
[43:09.71]Really?
[43:10.03]Really?
[43:12.26]If I would have fallen there, well, you fell in.
[43:15.02]Well, yeah, like you can only jump once you've hit the ground.
[43:18.00]Oh, okay.
[43:21.54]Oh, I gotta stop.
[43:29.75]So why are we going this far away?
[43:31.97]Uh, I'm personally, personally, I'm looking for corruption.
[43:38.21]Which is a biome that we're not currently in.
[43:41.33]Give me your mouse for a minute, I need to do something.
[43:44.69]Are they hostile?
[43:45.35]A boar is hostile?
[43:46.79]It is now.
[43:51.84]Cool, alright.
[43:54.58]They dropped bacon, which is good.
[43:56.62]Bacon?
[43:59.28]Yeah, who doesn't want bacon?
[44:01.90]So what's the first boss?
[44:04.46]The first one I want to fight is a giant worm in the desert, which is why we built the desert.
[44:11.04]Epic.
[44:12.94]See, like, down here, this chest?
[44:14.42]Yeah.
[44:15.28]This is what life is all about in Terraria, dude.
[44:17.38]This is what it's all about.
[44:20.88]It had, like, garbage in it.
[44:21.92]Here.
[44:22.40]I'm going to give you a bunch of rope.
[44:27.27]What's your opinion on bacon?
[44:29.09]When I say the word bacon, what do you think of?
[44:31.97]I think of slices of bacon.
[44:33.47]Take those potions that are in there.
[44:42.02]Alright, where's that rope?
[44:42.90]Alright, so I technically can just go like... Yep.
[44:55.64]Okay.
[44:58.05]That's fun.
[44:58.47]What about these little tanks?
[45:00.05]Uh, they're little tanks.
[45:05.08]Oh, man.
[45:05.92]Air shot.
[45:07.86]Oh, dude.
[45:09.30]Epic, bro.
[45:11.22]I know, right?
[45:12.68]That's a delayed bacon reaction.
[45:14.17]Yeah, okay.
[45:20.67]This direction sucks.
[45:24.72]It's just desert.
[45:26.23]And I would slip.
[45:28.01]Desert and Yungle.
[45:30.71]Is that a bad thing?
[45:33.15]Yeah.
[45:33.79]I was looking for corruption, bruh.
[45:38.97]Is that poisonous or something?
[45:41.47]No.
[45:47.35]Oh, that's a cool particle effect.
[45:49.71]What the fuck?
[46:02.03]Wait, um, should I not go down there?
[46:04.99]You can do it.
[46:05.91]I believe.
[46:06.81]You need to heal.
[46:07.41]I'm good.
[46:13.13]There's a treasure chest over here.
[46:19.40]Oh, wow.
[46:19.88]Treasure chest.
[46:20.58]Holly.
[46:22.82]Oh, it's a festive Holly.
[46:30.78]This is cool.
[46:37.82]So, I don't think you ever said the person that you wanted to fight.
[46:40.48]The person we want to fight, the first boss.
[46:44.18]Big giant desert worm.
[46:53.96]It's a shot like a Roman candle, that's all I did.
[47:02.06]People are saying, what about the slime man?
[47:05.66]What about it?
[47:07.96]Is that the first boss?
[47:12.88]How do I get like a little buddy?
[47:17.92]How do I heal?
[47:19.96]H, if you have a potion.
[47:21.22]I thought I did.
[47:23.64]I'll give you some.
[47:26.82]I guess not.
[47:28.46]Oh, I do.
[47:30.08]Knocking down trees, eat an apple.
[47:32.57]Oh, how do I eat them?
[47:33.75]Just by clicking on them?
[47:35.27]Use, yeah, anyway, use everything.
[47:38.85]Only one.
[47:40.09]Oh.
[47:40.47]Only one.
[47:45.28]I did have a healing potion.
[47:46.14]Why was it not working?
[47:48.66]Uh, there's a healing cooldown that's pretty long.
[47:50.82]That shows if your inventory is minimized, there's a healing sickness, like, 40 second something cooldown.
[47:57.96]Oh, yeah, okay, okay.
[48:00.09]Well fed, I see.
[48:02.66]I don't know, I gotta be careful here.
[48:09.74]These little owls, what the hell are they?
[48:11.49]Your little guy keeps hitting these owls, and then they start to fucking attack me!
[48:17.17]They're always attacking.
[48:18.55]They are?
[48:18.85]Yeah.
[48:21.11]Don't blame me.
[48:26.90]Okay, is it like bees?
[48:28.24]Can they go in water?
[48:31.04]Most things actually can't.
[48:33.13]No, this thing can't.
[48:35.15]I swear if there's no corruption in this direction, it's your fault.
[48:44.75]How would it be my fault?
[48:45.95]What do you do with the money, the copper?
[48:49.49]You can buy things from the NPCs in the houses we made.
[48:52.08]I mean, the prisons we made.
[48:58.12]Is this a slime present?
[49:02.37]Why is there some... They're very generous.
[49:05.87]Oh, okay, I get it.
[49:10.51]Currency can be exchanged for goods and services.
[49:15.56]Oh.
[49:16.84]Let's get this tin very quickly.
[49:26.04]We went really, really, really far away.
[49:29.16]Yeah, we did.
[49:29.72]Are we going to have to make a new house?
[49:32.10]No.
[49:35.50]I don't even know where our house is.
[49:36.98]There's like nothing in this direction.
[49:45.67]You're looking for something very, very, very specific.
[49:48.45]It's usually like right next to you.
[49:53.76]Here, you know what?
[49:54.34]You have the blue potion in your inventory, recall potion.
[49:57.64]I do.
[49:58.78]Yes.
[50:00.08]Yeah, if you use that, it will take you to the bed.
[50:03.54]Oh, that's cool.
[50:09.80]I can actually drown in this?
[50:11.94]Yeah.
[50:13.94]Get out of the way, fucking slimes.
[50:24.36]How do I make a cool staff?
[50:27.24]A cool staff?
[50:28.22]That's what I'm talking about.
[50:30.72]The one you have will be decent for a while.
[50:32.98]Okay.
[50:36.08]For you to get a cool one, we're going to need to kill a boss.
[50:39.62]Okay.
[50:41.46]Okay.
[50:43.41]Settle down.
[50:43.85]You don't have to scream at me.
[50:46.31]I'm screaming.
[50:49.21]Are you back at home?
[50:50.41]No.
[50:52.05]Should I be?
[50:54.19]Yeah, I'm still going in this direction, and I don't think it's going to be this way.
[50:57.43]Okay.
[51:01.23]So you can try and go down the caves and find chests.
[51:05.29]Ooh, I got eggnog.
[51:05.97]Alright, I'm going back.
[51:16.86]There's a chef in the house.
[51:18.50]There's two people.
[51:19.26]Who's this guy?
[51:20.26]Calvin.
[51:21.38]They said sell to Calvin.
[51:28.58]Am I about to, like, let a vampire come into the house?
[51:32.31]Whoa, he just came in!
[51:33.25]I didn't open it.
[51:34.91]Oh, oh.
[51:35.93]You mean actual vampire.
[51:37.15]I thought you meant, like, by selling to him, he would turn into a vampire and you enable... Jerma, is it?
[51:43.03]I've heard good things, friend.
[51:47.18]Oh, okay.
[51:49.06]Sell price.
[51:54.00]Will this giant wasp kill this guy?
[51:57.27]Yeah.
[51:59.31]He's got a baseball?
[52:02.88]Baseball.
[52:04.00]Don't fall for it.
[52:05.26]I tried the baseball before.
[52:08.39]Not impressed.
[52:09.63]People are gonna scream at me.
[52:11.57]I don't know if... I was not this way.
[52:14.31]God dang it.
[52:15.17]And I can't recall because you slept in the bed.
[52:21.68]I'm probably doing something so wrong.
[52:35.15]Wait, iron anvil.
[52:38.98]Don't ever sell ore or gel.
[52:43.34]Did I?
[52:46.82]You probably did.
[52:47.92]No, I didn't.
[52:53.76]Buy the hat.
[52:55.80]Bug net.
[52:57.75]Piggy bank.
[52:58.45]What about a piggy bank?
[52:59.67]Do we need that?
[53:02.39]Uh, don't worry about piggy bank.
[53:05.01]Okay.
[53:05.21]Okay.
[53:07.35]Where's this hat people are talking about?
[53:08.73]I don't see a hat.
[53:12.39]There's a shuriken.
[53:14.62]Oh, mining helmet.
[53:19.64]Is there a quick way to see how much money I have?
[53:23.58]Gold.
[53:24.04]I have one gold.
[53:29.53]If you're going to buy anything, talk to the demolitionist and buy bombs.
[53:33.35]Bombs and dynamite.
[53:37.54]Get the Moonglow back.
[53:38.48]When you die, you drop money as well, so you might lose it.
[53:42.43]Moonglow?
[53:47.33]Why'd you sell the Wolfram?
[53:49.49]I don't even know what that is.
[53:51.39]It's a piece of glass to me.
[53:58.10]Don't be afraid to ask.
[53:59.10]You know, you ask questions.
[54:00.26]Okay, Star, what is Wolfram Shard?
[54:03.77]It's a very early game item.
[54:05.41]You can craft them into early game armor.
[54:07.15]They're pretty good.
[54:08.13]Okay.
[54:09.11]What is Moonglow?
[54:11.85]Moonglow is normally used to make potions, but it's not important because we have a potion NPC, so I wouldn't bother with it.
[54:19.46]Okay.
[54:21.70]What is Gel?
[54:23.84]Gel is the drop from the jellies, mostly used in torches.
[54:29.34]A couple other things.
[54:31.18]What is Blinkroot?
[54:33.37]also used for potions and not relevant for us.
[54:39.85]What is Deathweed Seeds?
[54:43.84]Anything that's plant-based or seed-based is going to be a potion crafting and does not matter.
[54:48.80]I'm helping you study for the test with flashcards.
[54:56.63]OK.
[54:58.43]So let me craft something.
[55:01.55]What do I want to do?
[55:04.90]So we couldn't find the thing that you wanted to find.
[55:06.58]You said buy bombs from this guy.
[55:08.66]Yeah.
[55:11.54]Bomb.
[55:12.76]Grenade or bomb?
[55:16.06]Uh, not grenades.
[55:17.55]Either bombs or dynamite.
[55:18.89]Dynamite's very expensive, though.
[55:25.69]How many should I have?
[55:26.23]Like five?
[55:26.67]Ten?
[55:28.09]I have 64 right now.
[55:29.37]You have 64 bombs?
[55:31.43]Yeah.
[55:32.47]What?
[55:32.69]I just spent all my money on bombs.
[55:40.60]Do you have any of the Nature Essences?
[55:45.36]Um... Nature Essence.
[55:48.48]It might be a- I got fucking torches on the ground.
[55:51.64]What?
[55:54.89]I just like threw everything in there.
[55:56.33]So I can get my bomb back.
[56:00.53]Everything that I don't know what it's used for is just going in this chest.
[56:04.07]Okay.
[56:04.75]That's how you should do it.
[56:05.59]I'll make a second chest because we'll probably need more.
[56:09.47]Before we can get the super chest.
[56:12.20]Potions.
[56:13.26]Apple.
[56:13.96]Torch.
[56:17.00]Annoying.
[56:17.82]How is a copper axe annoying?
[56:19.98]I don't know, dude.
[56:24.22]Candy cane ball.
[56:24.86]I want that out.
[56:25.74]Just in case I need it.
[56:26.54]No, what am I thinking?
[56:28.32]Don't use those.
[56:28.96]Doesn't matter.
[56:32.61]Alright, Wand of Sparking or Superior Amethyst Staff?
[56:36.59]15, 13, 4% crit.
[56:37.91]I mean, okay, it's blue, good, green, great, and then what, like, purple, legendary or something?
[56:46.18]What's the item list?
[56:46.86]Yeah, it's just like, there's random names.
[56:48.92]There's, like, murderous, godly, legendary.
[56:53.10]They're all, like, the same basic stats, so as long as it's not negatives, it's fine.
[56:57.31]So green is better than blue.
[57:01.01]I actually don't know the order.
[57:04.11]I'm just gonna have prefixes.
[57:05.55]Okay.
[57:11.91]Alright, so, um... Are we gonna stick around in here?
[57:15.56]Are we gonna adventure again, or what do you wanna do?
[57:18.34]Um, hold on.
[57:19.06]I'm grabbing these stars and then we're gonna go to the right.
[57:21.34]Because it's gonna help speed things up a lot if we can find that corruption I was looking for.
[57:25.32]It's probably just right up where we started.
[57:26.82]Make sure I get all my shit ready.
[57:32.86]Okay, I got... I'm alright.
[57:38.30]Purple is the best.
[57:39.98]Alright, sick.
[57:42.72]Alright, let's go.
[57:47.98]Uh, here's mana.
[57:49.84]Ooh.
[57:55.11]Now I have three mana stars.
[57:58.03]Ooh!
[57:58.63]Now you don't think this is too dark?
[57:59.93]Don't you think we should have, like, a path lit up?
[58:04.71]Maybe one day.
[58:05.25]I can do a flare.
[58:08.41]Alright, there's a zombie ahead.
[58:14.01]Just, I wanna make sure you can see him.
[58:16.67]I can see him, clearly.
[58:18.14]What is that weapon that you're using right now?
[58:20.44]You have like a big like, claw.
[58:34.38]You have torches in your hotbar.
[58:35.54]Yeah, I know, but he got mad at me when I did this.
[58:38.62]I'm sure you can do that all you want.
[58:41.44]I'm not gonna get mad.
[58:43.30]You said, torches on the ground.
[58:47.27]Torches on the ground.
[58:48.43]I meant, like, torches on the ground in the base were annoying, because the ground on the base gets filled up by a whole bunch of nonsense.
[59:00.58]Torches on the ground.
[59:03.64]That's what you said.
[59:04.12]Sorry, I didn't know you thought of me that way.
[59:09.93]I can make some wood armor.
[59:11.19]Do you have any armor on?
[59:13.99]A tiny bit.
[59:16.07]What's that?
[59:16.99]Fallen star.
[59:17.65]That's it.
[59:20.43]That's what you need three of.
[59:22.02]Really?
[59:22.26]Yeah.
[59:23.98]And after I have three of these, I can what?
[59:26.66]Combine them into the mana crystal.
[59:28.88]Oh.
[59:31.62]Somebody's house.
[59:32.68]Oh.
[59:34.28]Wait, this is where you built this?
[59:36.41]This is where we started.
[59:37.27]Oh, okay.
[59:39.17]Why don't we just use this place?
[59:40.93]That place is way better than yours.
[59:42.15]Mm-mm.
[59:43.87]What do you mean, uh-huh?
[59:44.71]You think it is, but you're wrong.
[59:46.72]Oh, because that one doesn't have people trapped inside of walls to make sure they stay there.
[59:52.02]Yeah.
[59:52.68]So what does this mean?
[59:53.26]That's where we died.
[60:09.83]Track.
[60:10.21]I'm gonna track him.
[60:11.86]Lead the target.
[60:16.26]Star got snapped.
[60:21.98]Look at these air shots.
[60:31.79]So, I'm assuming we're probably going to do a thing where we just both stand above a cave and drop bombs down the cave.
[60:39.52]Eventually.
[60:44.70]That is the plan.
[60:45.64]Or we get the super bomb that auto-drills to hell.
[60:49.14]Auto-drills to hell.
[60:55.22]If I alt-click an item, it locks them so I don't auto-deposit them.
[60:58.43]That's good to know.
[60:59.03]Oh, yeah.
[60:59.23]Yeah, yeah.
[60:59.57]That's important.
[61:06.28]So why don't we just start digging down and maneuvering?
[61:09.74]Why are we just walking left and right?
[61:13.02]Okay, we've been playing for an hour, and all we've done is walk very far left and right.
[61:19.54]It's all you've done.
[61:23.08]I didn't even have to make noise for that one.
[61:25.32]Alright, somebody's house.
[61:29.54]This is one of the mods.
[61:31.17]It's a boss, but only in hard mode.
[61:34.01]But it has a chest up here.
[61:39.46]It had money.
[61:41.38]Nothing else?
[61:44.54]Nothing else.
[61:45.68]Okay, this is what I was looking for.
[61:47.90]Something got in here.
[61:48.98]How did this get in here?
[61:50.69]Stop placing torches!
[61:58.19]I can't go down.
[62:00.09]Why did you bring me in this?
[62:01.17]That snowman's gonna fuck you up, dude.
[62:04.08]Remember to heal.
[62:04.82]H, H, H.
[62:09.84]What is this?
[62:11.93]What did you bring us?
[62:13.63]Don't shoot that.
[62:20.93]Okay.
[62:21.43]You need to keep these off of me.
[62:24.05]We need to fight these.
[62:25.47]While we descend down into the corruption.
[62:29.24]Bomb the shadow orbs.
[62:31.04]This is giving me too many things.
[62:32.72]This is not like the first zone in World of Warcraft.
[62:36.93]I'm still right now on kill the boars.
[62:42.22]And you're telling me we're going to bomb through the shaft.
[62:44.12]We're going to run through this way.
[62:45.26]You got five seconds.
[62:46.96]Pick up the crystal.
[62:48.10]Okay.
[62:52.08]It's a very simple Jerm.
[62:53.08]We just have to descend the shaft.
[62:55.22]I have no torches now.
[62:56.34]I like this music.
[63:03.60]Descend the shaft.
[63:04.34]Kill the snowman.
[63:08.31]If you can do the entire, do you want to build a snowman song right now?
[63:12.69]And I mean, without even looking it up and just going, I will give you a dollar.
[63:17.68]No, I will give you a dollar and store credit to GameStop.
[63:21.28]Holy shit.
[63:21.88]I thought you just killed yourself.
[63:23.08]I thought I did too.
[63:27.10]Dude, you're the one who doesn't know what they're doing and you're going faster than me.
[63:34.02]I'm just trying to get back up.
[63:35.00]Give me the apples.
[63:39.26]Alright, I'm good.
[63:42.00]Remember.
[63:43.02]One apple.
[63:44.30]Right, right, right, right, right, right.
[63:45.32]One apple.
[63:54.36]You probably ended the first, like, wow dungeon before I even know what my character's rotation is.
[64:01.50]Your rotation is shoot staff.
[64:03.57]I'm the person that gets screamed at in the dead mines because I don't know how to heal somebody.
[64:10.55]I'm the person in the Deadmines that's playing a healer that is auto-attack right-clicking on people.
[64:17.79]And cannot figure out why.
[64:19.13]Alright, let's go.
[64:22.61]Oh god.
[64:30.07]This way, this way.
[64:34.83]too fast okay see those orbs under the ground are you zoomed out enough that you can see them um no yes I can see them that's what we're here for we're here for those people I need to bomb should I just should I just kill the enemies yeah don't fall in that hole I'm gonna try not to
[65:04.55]How do you throw bombs?
[65:08.04]In your slot.
[65:10.70]Don't die, don't die.
[65:12.44]That worm's coming up again.
[65:13.38]I'm dead.
[65:23.25]I hardly knew you.

[65:57.84]No, that's not going to happen.
[65:59.14]Alright, let me go.
[66:01.54]So, arcane dust.
[66:04.46]No, no, no.
[66:04.96]I need to pull some materials up.
[66:06.30]Wood?
[66:06.76]Can I just make wooden armor?
[66:08.30]Stone armor?
[66:10.86]You should be able to make wood armor.
[66:12.14]There's a bunch of cactus around.
[66:13.16]Make cactus armor.
[66:14.22]Cactus armor.
[66:14.96]Yeah.
[66:18.80]How much does it take to make one?
[66:20.96]I don't know.
[66:21.82]We'll find out.
[66:24.56]also in Terraria when you have a full set like if you have a helmet armor and leggings of a cactus then you get an extra bonus okay cactus I have to do that hold on where does this go alright that's better how many do I need oh what when I was only two
[66:52.23]Why is it... Why is there a, uh, Metal Gear Rising... like... bar down here?
[66:59.24]For how well I did on the level?
[67:01.64]No reason.
[67:04.06]Are you fighting a boss right now?
[67:06.12]Nah, I ran.
[67:09.10]Okay.
[67:10.00]Cactus Lamp.
[67:18.03]Cactus... How do I make cactus armor?
[67:22.87]uh stand near the anvil when you have enough of it and it'll show the option when you press escape you bombed a second one what it's supposed to be three to some of them I only thought I did the two there were two right there okay whatever I didn't pick anything up from it did I how the I need my axe
[67:53.44]I think I have to go back.
[67:59.91]Where's my pickaxe?
[68:01.43]There it is.
[68:06.13]Alright, let's get... Cactus!
[68:18.08]You can't even cut cacti with a sword.
[68:20.23]Zero out of ten.
[68:27.86]You can pickaxe the sand underneath the cactus, and then the whole cactus goes away.
[68:32.11]Oh.
[68:33.93]Do you get more for doing it like this, or does it not matter at all?
[68:37.05]The same.
[68:39.39]Hold shift to auto-select the correct tool.
[68:43.33]Well, that's the best fucking advice I've heard all day.
[68:46.46]I didn't know you could do that.
[68:49.40]Holy shit, that's amazing.
[68:50.42]Wow.
[68:50.52]Um...
[68:58.60]That's the best.
[68:59.68]Yeah.
[69:00.44]That works.
[69:01.24]Wonders.
[69:02.93]I think I had 32 copper?
[69:12.65]Hold control while mining to make it easier.
[69:16.34]Gotta hold shift, gotta hold control, gotta... What else do I gotta do?
[69:21.32]Hold me in your arm.
[69:22.00]Alright, I think I have enough.
[69:34.25]I remember watching you play this before.
[69:37.19]A long, long, long time ago.
[69:40.19]And eventually, you got to a point where there was so much going on on the screen at the same time.
[69:45.82]Yeah, it turns into a bullet hell.
[69:47.30]Yeah.
[69:48.02]It was just... There's fire everywhere.
[69:51.04]You were just like... Like a machine gun out of your hands.
[69:55.22]Yep.
[69:59.10]Right now, this is our humble beginnings.
[70:02.81]But you turn into, like, a JoJo character.
[70:06.82]You guys like JoJo, right?
[70:07.90]That's all you're talking about.
[70:08.68]Is that a cactus, like, underwear?
[70:09.64]Cactus bikini?
[70:13.48]Ooh, I have a good spell for you.
[70:16.16]And now we're ready to slam a boss.
[70:18.13]Cactus leggings.
[70:19.93]Cool.
[70:21.97]Cactus breastplate.
[70:24.59]Cactus helmet.
[70:26.53]So is it boots, or is it just legs, head, and breastplate?
[70:31.64]Legs, head, breastplate, yeah.
[70:33.02]And is there a certain place I have to put this?
[70:36.13]If you right-click it, it goes to the right side of your screen.
[70:38.81]There's an inventory over there.
[70:41.53]Like what you're wearing equipment.
[70:42.51]But if you right-click it, it'll auto-equip.
[70:47.05]Oh, I see.
[70:47.53]Okay.
[70:50.48]Why does this guy keep talking to me?
[70:54.44]Trying to get past the... Leave me alone.
[70:56.76]Alright, so I have... I currently am...
[71:01.61]Uh, Aquaman.
[71:15.44]Gingerbread Cookie?
[71:16.86]Mistletoe.
[71:18.84]Oh.
[71:20.02]Modern improvement to all stats.
[71:22.04]For 30 minutes.
[71:22.74]Do you want this?
[71:26.27]Uh... I feel like this is a U item.
[71:30.01]What have you been doing?
[71:32.99]What the fuck are you doing?
[71:37.14]What are you doing?
[71:41.48]That was my lamp!
[71:46.91]Oh my god, our beds are right next to each other.
[71:51.20]Well, no, they're not.
[71:52.06]Our heads are... Alright.
[71:55.22]Are we ready to fight this boss?
[71:57.52]Um, there's a couple things we need.
[71:59.00]Hold on, let me look up the other one.
[72:00.94]Rotten... Alright, I need to put some stuff away.
[72:05.10]Wait, I gotta make the... Don't deposit this thing, right?
[72:09.50]Alt-click?
[72:10.40]What is it?
[72:16.75]And my bombs... Yeah.
[72:18.05]Does that work?
[72:20.61]Kind of.
[72:23.10]You look very cute.
[72:24.16]You can hover over your armor to see the set bonus.
[72:29.02]Plus one defense.
[72:29.88]Oh, that's cool.
[72:34.15]Okay, we need to wait for night.
[72:35.35]I need to get one of those stars.
[72:37.57]Also, we need to kill a storm antlion, which is going to be in this antlion, but it's blue.
[72:43.03]It's very different than other antlions.
[72:45.43]This is way more than I thought this game was.
[72:48.55]This game has a lot.
[72:51.50]And like I said, turns into a bullet hell.
[72:58.31]Alright, so what I'm going to do, after I do this fun little tutorial session, where we hang out and we fight a few bosses and we play for a while, I'm going to look up Wikipedia articles of this game.
[73:11.84]Okay.
[73:12.36]And then determine, after reading the wiki pages, if it's like, yeah, I'm going to do this long term.
[73:18.87]We'll get like after we start killing the first few things here, we're going to pick up the pace really quickly in a moment.
[73:24.56]OK.
[73:28.02]What are you doing?
[73:32.38]I'm roping.
[73:38.00]Oh, I have to give you the thing.
[73:39.20]The thing?
[73:42.07]This.
[73:42.45]I'm dropping it right here.
[73:44.47]Is that vile thorn?
[73:47.21]I picked it up again.
[73:49.66]So what is this?
[73:50.54]That is your new wand.
[73:52.84]Ooh, 10 magic damage.
[73:59.10]Is there a way I can compare two items?
[74:03.15]No, just trust me, that one's better.
[74:04.99]It multi-hits a lot, so the damage is misleading.
[74:08.07]Whoa.
[74:13.51]Not as far, though.
[74:15.03]Yeah, it's pretty short range, but especially because the first bosses we're going to fight are like worms, it multi-hits all the segments of the worm and does a lot of damage.
[74:22.88]Oh, that's cool.
[74:33.83]A lot of stuff down here.
[74:34.81]Bomb healing potion.
[74:45.16]god damn it see what you're standing on right now I don't think we can mine it yet or bomb it I don't think bombing it but we need these fossils we need better pickaxes which we'll get after we fight the first bosses okay it's really good in tight spaces
[75:10.16]Oh, you can do a little in-between, huh?
[75:12.64]Yeah, it goes all... Oh, yeah, it shoots through walls, too.
[75:17.00]Kind of out of mana.
[75:19.80]When you do get mana potions, Jay uses them for a Jerma.
[75:25.61]Jay for Jerma?
[75:26.95]I know that, and that's my name.
[75:29.71]Oh, and enemies drop stars that give you mana.
[75:32.33]Yeah, picked up on that a little bit.
[75:43.42]These are the ones we... I need a mandible from one of these blue boys.
[75:47.64]Mandible?
[75:48.18]Okay, we got it.
[75:48.98]Okay, we can leave.
[75:53.02]What about that coin?
[75:55.18]A coin?
[75:56.12]There's a coin over there.
[75:59.19]It's a silver coin.
[76:00.79]I don't care.
[76:05.35]Well, what an adventure that was.
[76:07.17]I have a feeling Jeremy's never going to play this again.
[76:18.32]I don't know.
[76:18.86]It seems like it's kind of fun.
[76:24.84]Walk left and right.
[76:25.61]Find one of the fallen stars and don't combine it.
[76:28.13]We need one.
[76:29.37]I have one.
[76:31.73]Okay, drop it.
[76:35.49]I love this dude.
[76:36.31]Oh my god.
[76:38.29]I know.
[76:43.63]Oh, I know.

[82:33.20]The trick is to make cactus chairs, so they're definitely in prison.
[82:37.16]Thank you for that Minecraft stream pog.
[82:41.28]Once it's daytime, we can fight this boss.
[82:43.16]Tell Star he's handsome.
[82:44.44]I will.
[82:46.77]That's a lot of money.
[82:47.37]Thank you so much, Tim.
[82:48.17]And then the ball is really going to start rolling.
[82:50.81]Somebody said that you are handsome.
[82:52.97]Tim says you're handsome.
[82:53.89]They paid me $50 to tell you that.
[82:57.59]I'm streaming.
[82:58.23]Yeah, you are streaming.
[83:04.58]You could have paid him $50 and say, hey, you're handsome.
[83:08.18]You paid me $50 to tell him he's handsome.
[83:15.25]Alright.
[83:16.31]So now... Why are we trapping people in these cages here?
[83:26.27]Is this to make sure that they don't leave?
[83:27.65]Is that what I'm understanding?
[83:28.90]It's easy to talk to them.
[83:31.62]So it's efficient to just walk through here and talk to them because you need the NPCs.
[83:35.54]You need collectively 30 rooms by the end of Terraria.
[83:39.20]There's a lot of people.
[83:41.93]so if you would like to make them an actual house for 30 people you're more than welcome to start doing that I'll tell you you're handsome for free thanks man but you'll give but you'll give me the money to that's funny
[84:10.13]Alright, I got a lot of burgers, so I might go to the food department.
[84:14.80]Why is there a goldfish walking around outside?
[84:16.54]Alright, they just let him get up.
[84:22.04]That was terrible.
[84:25.28]I saw that coming from a mile away, too.
[84:26.92]I couldn't do anything.
[84:29.01]I couldn't protect him.
[84:31.31]He didn't seem to be bothered by it, though.
[84:36.55]Ooh, that was close.
[84:41.57]Yeah, with the, um, the way the ground is in front of the door, normally monsters will hit doors, but they have to jump first because there's a gap.
[84:48.41]They can't open these.
[84:49.33]So you can just shoot them through the wall.
[84:53.15]You freaking cheater.
[84:54.95]So, you have to summon bosses.
[84:59.03]Uh, not all of them, but generally, yeah.
[85:02.69]What does Jeffrey do?
[85:05.69]What does Jeffrey do?
[85:07.92]I don't know.
[85:08.34]What does Jeffrey do?
[85:10.34]Which one's Jeffrey?
[85:11.22]Their names are randomized.
[85:12.82]Oh, Jeffrey.
[85:13.44]Okay, this is important.
[85:16.56]Okay, he gave me $50.
[85:17.48]He's just a nice guy.
[85:19.81]He says, sorry.
[85:21.67]Don't be sorry.
[85:23.23]Thank you very much.
[85:25.09]When you talk to Jeffrey, you click crafting, and then you see on the left side of your screen it says place material here.
[85:31.41]Hold on.
[85:35.99]crafting place material here so if you put a material there he'll tell you everything that material can potentially make oh man now I know why you have like five million hours in this game he's like making in-game wikipedia starting to make sense alright so I'm not using this cop the bow do you want the bow uh sell it
[86:10.38]Okay, alright I sold that sword
[86:31.62]I sold the sword.
[86:32.26]Are you happy?
[86:32.74]Are you proud of me?
[86:34.95]You mean the bow?
[86:36.27]No, the sword.
[86:36.93]The sword that you hate.
[86:39.05]What the fuck?
[86:40.13]Three dollars.
[86:40.87]Jerma is a bald loser.
[86:42.99]Oh my god, dude.
[86:43.45]Should've given that to me.
[86:46.31]I didn't know you had haters.
[86:47.67]I didn't know I was streaming with a person who had haters.
[86:53.71]Haters.
[86:56.43]Haters.
[87:00.06]My social media is clean.
[87:03.22]Well, my social media is barren.
[87:05.69]I use it like once a year.
[87:07.81]Same.
[87:07.97]Okay, are you ready to fight a worm?
[87:15.73]You're my cosplay bodyguard.
[87:18.76]I'm the guy in the gigantic suit that can't really move around and needs like four people to show him where to go.
[87:27.50]And then you have to like guide me around and then stop me when people want to take selfies with me.
[87:31.96]Oh, you know what we haven't gotten any of is life crystals.
[87:34.84]So we're both chumps.
[87:35.84]Eat an apple.
[87:37.33]Eat an apple.
[87:42.39]Yeah.
[87:46.95]Um, where are my grenades?
[87:48.35]Why did we both eat apples?
[87:49.45]Because we're about to fight a boss.
[87:52.17]Oh, shit.
[87:52.61]Hold on.
[87:52.92]Let me get ready.
[87:53.42]Alright.
[87:54.02]So I got apples.
[87:55.80]I got burgers.
[87:58.82]Eat them.
[88:00.30]Eat one.
[88:00.68]Eat a burger?
[88:02.77]But I just ate an apple.
[88:04.61]Eat them both.
[88:06.35]What?
[88:07.70]Titan.
[88:08.18]Increased knockback.
[88:09.00]False stomach.
[88:09.54]Why'd you make me do that?
[88:10.30]Those are expensive.
[88:11.00]Because we're gonna fight a boss.
[88:13.38]Right now?
[88:13.84]Like, right now.
[88:14.38]You're gonna spawn it right now.
[88:15.30]Right now.
[88:15.82]Like, right now.
[88:16.60]You're ready right now.
[88:17.78]Alright, I'm ready.
[88:18.94]I'm... Hit it in the face.
[88:24.33]Hit it in the back.
[88:24.87]Hit it in the butt.
[88:30.95]Did we kill it?
[88:33.11]Are you throwing bombs?
[88:33.93]Yeah.
[88:35.92]You blew up our fucking house, dude.
[88:44.06]Oops.
[88:46.30]What did you drop?
[88:48.76]You don't even get to know.
[88:50.24]You blew up our house.
[88:52.27]You were throwing bombs, too.
[88:54.17]I was throwing grenades, which specifically do not blow up terrain.
[89:04.97]I just saw the explosions and I was like, oh, I guess I'll do that too.
[89:08.39]I felt like I was supposed to be doing that.
[89:12.69]It's alright, it was just this side.
[89:13.89]Alright, there's somebody in here.
[89:16.05]That's the traveling merchant.
[89:18.86]He's the hot guy.
[89:19.62]Okay, what about it?
[89:22.12]Angel Halo?
[89:24.88]Paint sprayer.
[89:27.12]He sells random shit.
[89:28.08]There's a DPS meter.
[89:31.66]Oh, shitty.
[89:32.48]I need money.
[89:33.44]I need money!
[89:35.52]Uh, I have four silver.
[89:37.44]Where did all my money go?
[89:42.91]I thought I had like 80 silver.
[89:44.21]Uh, have you died?
[89:48.33]Once or twice?
[89:49.15]Oh, the burgers, the burgers, the burgers, the burgers.
[89:52.15]No, the burgers are like, I bought like fucking six burgers, seven burgers.
[90:00.16]Tiki torch.
[90:03.30]Alright, can you make, um... Can we make my candy cane room, please?
[90:08.60]Uh, can we find another boss real fast?
[90:10.74]Uh, I did not know that we are going... Did we do that?
[90:12.86]Right?
[90:13.42]Yeah, sure.
[90:14.00]Okay, that's how this works.
[90:15.06]Let's do it again.
[90:16.02]Another boss.
[90:17.96]What was that?
[90:19.90]That's the trophy from the last one.
[90:22.86]It doesn't do anything.
[90:25.91]Do you have the platforms?
[90:26.97]$50.
[90:26.99]$50 just came in right now from Chunky Bologna.
[90:31.15]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[90:32.44]They say, hey, Ster.
[90:33.64]This is a great stream.
[90:34.64]Keep it up, buddy.
[90:36.34]Hey.
[90:38.02]No problem.
[90:38.72]Alright.
[90:43.60]You've got to be ready for this one.
[90:45.24]Okay.
[90:46.34]No joke.
[90:47.12]Do I eat the hamburger again?
[90:49.68]It should still be going.
[90:50.71]It's not.
[90:52.08]This one might kick our ass, actually.
[90:54.16]Give me some tips.
[90:56.70]Tips?
[90:57.34]If you run too far away, it will teleport on top of you.
[91:02.38]You can actually use your recall potions to teleport back into the base.
[91:06.64]We don't have the medic yet.
[91:08.80]We'll be fine.
[91:09.56]I'm going to summon him over here, I think.
[91:11.70]You're not going to throw any bombs?
[91:13.48]Don't throw bombs.
[91:15.44]Only use my auto attack.
[91:19.30]Where is he?
[91:22.64]Ow.
[91:25.24]Yeah, we're still slow and don't have any movement.
[91:35.33]Ah!
[91:36.75]Ah!
[91:41.65]He can't get me.
[91:43.71]He can teleport.
[91:44.45]I'm dead.
[91:50.75]You can do it.
[91:51.29]He's almost dead.
[91:51.89]I was a distraction.
[91:59.16]4%.
[91:59.18]0.5%.
[92:01.10]0%.
[92:01.58]Come on.
[92:02.40]Fill the dot.
[92:03.76]I got him.
[92:07.88]Nice.
[92:17.42]Why did I spawn all the way back here?
[92:22.85]oh that's it's some I don't know if it's a random bug that spawns you there sometimes or you accidentally right click your bed and it unsets your spawn point is it very annoying you might have so I I think we need to put our beds somewhere else oh so we don't accidentally right click them people saying I blew up the bed you I don't think you did did I not
[92:48.08]Yeah, no, the bed's still there.
[92:49.30]I think you just accidentally right-clicked it.
[92:51.64]The wall was damaged, so that room no longer counts for a bed to work.
[92:55.37]Oh, that's actually true.
[93:01.59]Uh, guys, do you make the Eye of Cthulhu summon a demon altar, or can you do it in an animal?
[93:10.29]Guys, do you know how to play the game?
[93:12.59]Because I don't.
[93:15.41]Why do I have a door in my inventory?
[93:21.18]Yeah, I'm gonna make Jerma jealous.
[93:23.92]He wants to ride the slime.
[93:26.40]How do I put the door down?
[93:28.78]Uh, there's no wall.
[93:35.55]There you go.
[93:36.41]Okay, so now I can right-click this.
[93:38.05]Spawn point set.
[93:41.67]Oh, you trapped him.
[93:42.51]Okay.
[93:42.75]Uh... Alright, so...
[93:50.66]You're doing a lot of playing and not a whole lot of describing.
[93:54.19]Describing?
[93:55.19]So we just killed two bosses.
[93:57.11]We just killed that guy.
[93:57.95]He got me this.
[93:59.33]He got you that.
[94:00.05]Yeah.
[94:01.49]What is he getting me?
[94:02.05]What did he get you?
[94:04.21]He got me my hidden blade technique throwing knife technique.
[94:09.55]Cool.
[94:09.97]You're getting a lot of fun stuff.
[94:11.51]When do I get the Super Mario shoe?
[94:13.87]Their percentage chance drops and he didn't really drop any mage shit so you didn't really get anything.
[94:23.41]Sorry, dude.
[94:24.51]Alright, fine.
[94:25.71]So, let's go.
[94:28.01]I'm ready.
[94:30.30]Um... We could probably... Kill the Eater of Worlds.
[94:37.56]The Eater of Worlds.
[94:39.61]Yeah.
[94:40.21]And then we'll start getting... We'll start getting...
[94:47.66]Games with Ster.
[94:48.48]He takes all the drops and leaves you 10 miles behind.
[94:50.86]Actually, there are clearly no drops for him.
[95:01.73]I didn't say anything.
[95:04.39]I know it's true.
[95:06.91]It's fine.
[95:09.55]I'm okay with that.
[95:12.33]I need to go see down here if dynamite...
[95:15.31]Destroys fossil.
[95:16.69]I don't think it does.
[95:18.85]I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go over here.
[95:21.13]I'm gonna just go this way.
[95:23.91]Wait, are we leaving our friends vulnerable?
[95:26.75]Doors open?
[95:30.05]It does not.
[95:32.43]Um... They're a little vulnerable.
[95:36.23]Alright, I closed the doors.
[95:37.37]You know what?
[95:37.69]I'm gonna go down.
[95:38.35]I'm gonna go down like a little cave.
[95:39.53]There's another boss we can fight.
[95:41.37]Right now.
[95:43.42]I think I think I can do it right now.
[95:44.86]Oh my god.
[95:45.36]Can you fucking refill this sand?
[95:47.62]Can you show some responsibility?
[95:49.93]What sand?
[95:52.63]The hole you made.
[95:53.75]Refill it with sand.
[95:56.31]It keeps up the enemies, but it's keeping me out too.
[95:58.77]How do I open this door?
[96:01.07]Oh, you can't open it inward now because I placed the furnace there.
[96:04.37]Oh.
[96:05.97]We're running out of space.
[96:07.33]Alright, I'll fix it.
[96:08.31]I'll fix the sand.
[96:09.35]Just hold on.
[96:10.70]Yeah, and I can summon a boss.
[96:12.48]Let me fix the sand first.
[96:14.28]We have to do it before it's nighttime.
[96:15.96]Let's do it now.
[96:18.58]And then you fix the sand.
[96:24.39]The Grand Thunderbird has awoken.
[96:27.31]He'll, like, charge at you, so you need to jump over him.
[96:35.21]Oh, I'm out of musket.
[96:36.99]Oh, he's like glitching out.
[96:38.21]What the fuck?
[96:40.39]It should be easier than the other ones we fought.
[96:42.03]Theoretically.
[96:45.52]I can't really reach him.
[96:58.55]I can't reach him.
[97:19.13]I'm not big enough.
[97:23.25]Okay, here you go, Jerma.
[97:24.37]What do you got now?
[97:24.84]Take this staff.
[97:26.02]Ooh!
[97:26.10]Let me look, let me look, let me look.
[97:29.16]You can summon a bird.
[97:29.96]A bird friend.
[97:33.04]Eleven summon damage.
[97:34.46]Very weak knockback.
[97:35.36]Uses ten mana.
[97:35.84]Summons a hatchling to zap your foes.
[97:39.57]So I should use more than one item, right?
[97:43.13]Yeah.
[97:43.67]That summon will always be out as long as you cast it.
[97:46.03]Oh, okay, cool.
[97:47.90]Wow, he's going down there.
[97:48.84]And again, it follows things and shoots things.
[97:50.22]Okay, now take these.
[97:51.48]This is a learning moment because I'm not going to leave you 10 miles behind.
[97:54.26]These are sandstone ingots.
[97:55.97]Yep.
[97:56.79]Take those to the guide.
[97:57.91]Okay.
[97:59.23]And do the crafting thing so you can see what you can make from sandstone.
[98:03.29]Okay.
[98:05.05]But first, let me do my responsibility, which is fix this shit up.
[98:14.11]He's going to craft a sandstone bath.
[98:22.05]Maybe.
[98:22.35]I don't think so.
[98:26.36]The sand also always falls when you place it, so you can place it from up here and it'll drop down.
[98:30.54]Oh.
[98:35.93]Fixed it.
[98:37.65]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[98:38.99]What, what, what?
[98:40.07]We need the tube below the door so monsters don't get in.
[98:43.18]Oh.
[98:45.91]Okay.
[98:46.97]Alright.
[98:48.17]Put the sandstone into this guy's slot here.
[98:54.96]Showing recipes that use sandstone ingot.
[98:58.56]So I'm wand and wand guy, right?
[99:03.24]Oh, sandstone pickaxe!
[99:05.74]We need one of those really bad, actually.
[99:07.76]Sandstone pickaxe.
[99:10.80]What about sandstone greaves?
[99:16.36]Uh, pickaxe, 100%.
[99:17.24]We need it.
[99:18.68]Okay.
[99:19.98]I'm sorry, I've made this seem like you're gonna have choices.
[99:25.73]Uh, did I make it?
[99:28.51]You have to actually go to the anvil and make it.
[99:30.17]He's just showing you what you can make.
[99:31.63]It's not in your inventory while you're showing it to him.
[99:35.23]What did I just do?
[99:36.15]I just heard, like, the... What the hell was that?
[99:40.51]Oh, no, no, he just gave it back to me.
[99:42.01]Okay, I get it.
[99:43.67]Yeah.
[99:44.03]Alright, anvil...
[99:46.90]Sandstone pickaxe.
[99:47.90]Should we both have one?
[99:48.68]Do you want one too?
[99:52.67]Only one of us needs to have one.
[99:54.09]Okay, so then should I make like a sandstone greaves?
[99:59.73]If there's also something you want to make, I can summon the boss again and we can get more sandstone ingots.
[100:04.23]We can.
[100:05.53]Yeah.
[100:06.25]Actually, I'm remembering the sandstone armor set is really, really good.
[100:10.77]So we're going to kill him like twice.
[100:12.13]Okay, so I got sandstone helmet, sandstone greaves.
[100:17.26]Yeah.
[100:17.64]2% movement speed, 5% throwing damage.
[100:20.96]Alright, I'm gonna make the helmet.
[100:25.23]Are there multiple helmets?
[100:27.07]There's... I don't think so.
[100:29.52]I made sandstone helmet.
[100:31.40]Thrower class.
[100:32.16]Fuck!
[100:35.63]Did I do something wrong?
[100:37.17]No, you're fine.
[100:38.59]There's not, like, a mage class.
[100:40.93]Sometimes armor sets have multiple helmets, so you can make it your class, but I think that set only has one.
[100:47.15]Okay.
[100:48.66]Well, I have it on now.
[100:51.82]Ooh, that looks cool.
[100:52.34]You can only summon him during the day, though, so we've got some time.
[100:55.30]Do you have the pickaxe?
[100:56.90]I do.
[100:57.94]Let's go in this hole.
[100:58.82]Okay.
[101:03.21]So, the pickaxe... This pickaxe is, like, really weak and slow and stuff.
[101:08.37]Or is it... Is there any reason at all for me to ever use the copper pickaxe ever again?
[101:14.30]No.
[101:14.96]Once you get a new pickaxe, the old one is done forever.
[101:17.16]Okay.
[101:17.36]I'm gonna sell it.
[101:23.79]The, like, old shit, like, copper pickaxe is really not even worth selling either.
[101:27.45]Oh.
[101:32.11]Okay.
[101:32.55]So this is how you can get that, uh... This is how they get that shit that we couldn't get before.
[101:36.45]The fossil stuff, right?
[101:38.35]I'm pretty sure we can get fossil with that pickaxe, yeah.
[101:41.01]And we need that.
[101:41.87]Pretty bad.
[101:42.63]Willy the traveling merchant has disappeared.
[101:52.56]Okay, right down here.
[101:53.34]This, like, dirt ground is fossil.
[101:54.98]Okay.
[101:57.25]Okay.
[102:01.27]Does that work?
[102:03.08]Dang, then we still can't get it.
[102:04.92]I'm pretty sure we're gonna need to get demonite pickaxe.
[102:08.56]So what can we do with this?
[102:09.86]Is it just faster?
[102:12.48]Just faster, yeah.
[102:15.50]It'll show, if you look at your pickaxe, it says pickaxe power something percent.
[102:20.94]55% power.
[102:21.66]Yeah, my power on my wood pickaxe is 30.
[102:24.93]So it's like that much faster.
[102:27.03]Demons?
[102:27.99]Munkah.
[102:29.63]Munkah?
[102:43.66]He did it.
[102:44.22]He did the... Star!
[102:46.99]Mine.
[102:47.35]Mine.
[102:47.77]Mine.
[102:48.27]You're a noobie.
[102:50.01]I gave you the other one.
[102:51.47]I gave you mine anyways.
[102:55.51]Noob.
[103:01.90]Ow.
[103:02.94]I'm almost dead.
[103:08.52]Can't fires give more health for Jen?
[103:13.85]Oh.
[103:15.21]Didn't a meteorite fall?
[103:16.21]Yeah, we could go get the meteorite, but we don't know where it is.
[103:18.37]I don't think.
[103:21.34]And... I think meteorite would actually become somewhat irrelevant soon here.
[103:26.18]It's good for mage, so we could go do that.
[103:28.62]Don't drop those stars in daylight.
[103:30.16]They break.
[103:31.50]Yeah.
[103:32.22]I'm... Yeah.
[103:33.14]Yeah.
[103:33.56]I didn't know if you knew that.
[103:39.38]Alright.
[103:39.60]So I got... Alright.
[103:43.06]We need to go in the jungle to get... We need more minerals, people are saying.
[103:46.84]More minerals?
[103:47.92]Minerals.
[103:52.40]Come on.
[103:53.18]Minerals.
[103:54.90]So who are we going to lock in here?
[103:58.63]Who shows up is kind of random.
[104:00.45]If you meant the prerequisite for the NPC to show up, they show up.
[104:04.15]And I want the... There's a guy who sells bullets that I really need.
[104:11.53]Can you make those two guys stop jumping around?
[104:14.37]It's distracting me.
[104:18.29]I can't.
[104:19.21]Squirrel!
[104:20.49]Can I pick it up?
[104:24.81]In fact, I'm gonna trade you.
[104:26.27]A golden fox just came in the house!
[104:30.85]Hey!
[104:32.61]It was a squirrel.
[104:34.21]Jerm, I'm gonna trade you.
[104:36.83]I'll trade you my helmet for your helmet.
[104:38.33]We could've... No.
[104:40.67]If you have my helmet, you can have two birds.
[104:43.85]Should I have two guys?
[104:44.77]I'll think about it.
[104:53.70]Okay.
[104:56.02]Here.
[105:06.34]Am I getting scammed?
[105:08.72]Oh.
[105:09.30]Oh.
[105:09.60]I'm sorry.
[105:10.00]Your helmet.
[105:12.80]Yes, you were getting scammed.
[105:13.94]I was getting scammed.
[105:15.64]You made a fucking cactus bathtub?
[105:17.16]That's what that was?
[105:20.55]What?
[105:21.53]Did you get a rivet?
[105:23.89]Oh, wow.
[105:26.07]You gave me the cactus bathtub.
[105:27.41]No, you didn't.
[105:29.21]No.
[105:30.18]I deleted that.
[105:35.49]right so now what are we gonna fight that boss um I think we have to because we have to wait till morning anyway we can go and fight actually no it's turning morning everyone's yelling star roof star roof everyone's like saying star roof I get on it let me make sure I can't summon this
[106:02.68]It tells you how fast you're running.
[106:04.80]18 miles per hour.
[106:05.54]That's really fast.
[106:10.13]Oh, did you buy the stopwatch?
[106:12.55]No, I just have it on.
[106:14.89]I think it's a helmet.
[106:17.31]Why do I have this?
[106:19.73]I mean, I bought a stopwatch.
[106:21.91]Maybe it works for you too because you're near me.
[106:24.70]I don't know.
[106:25.10]Maybe.
[106:27.14]Bullet guy on table.
[106:29.14]Oh, bullet guy is on table.
[106:32.04]Hmm?
[106:34.83]Wait, what?
[106:39.85]When did that person get in here?
[106:46.56]I love my laser hawks.
[106:51.54]Illegal gun parts.
[106:53.08]Mini shark.
[106:55.36]So if I'm gonna be, like, Mr. Magician, I don't want... Range damage is not the same thing as magic wand kind of damage.
[107:01.49]Yeah, specifically magic damage.
[107:03.13]Okay.
[107:04.38]You'll get spellbooks and wands in general.
[107:08.96]Alright.
[107:18.65]Alright.
[107:21.29]So we're just waiting for daytime, you said.
[107:24.26]Yeah, no, let's go this way.
[107:26.36]We have time.
[107:28.04]I also bought... I didn't get rid of them, right?
[107:32.32]Inventory is such a pain in the ass in this game.
[107:36.24]I just bought like 200 grenades and I can't find them.
[107:41.72]Star.
[107:43.84]I'll take that one.
[107:45.63]You've taken all of them so far.
[107:47.11]I deserve one.
[107:48.39]You have more mana than me.
[107:50.63]Don't eat.
[107:52.47]Yeah, but I'm the magic guy.
[107:54.65]I use mana.
[107:55.35]I shoot mana.
[107:57.27]Didn't you say we needed stone?
[107:59.51]No, not anymore.
[108:00.67]Oh, let's go.
[108:05.80]We actually really... Ooh, I got an element.
[108:09.52]Okay.
[108:09.78]Wrath element.
[108:11.34]Ooh, one up there.
[108:15.40]Oh, come on.
[108:15.74]You've got them all?
[108:16.92]Oh.
[108:19.74]Chump.
[108:22.86]Shut the... I was going to say, shut the fuck up.
[108:27.58]Looks like Darnell's throwing a party.
[108:30.04]Darnell?
[108:30.58]Did we miss the party?
[108:32.20]The drug dealer?
[108:35.24]Wait.
[108:36.60]Did mom and dad go on vacation and the kids are throwing a party in the house?
[108:42.65]Yeah.
[108:44.40]I got an idea.
[108:44.90]Let's call his cell phone.
[108:48.14]mean it's daytime let's call it the recall potions I do um alt select them so they don't move and like put them at the bottom right of your inventory so the next time you're dying and you need to like get away quick you know where they are did you just do that yeah use a recall potion we're gonna fight the boss because it's daytime
[109:14.87]I was gonna say, call his cell phone.
[109:17.35]And tell them we're coming home early.
[109:19.09]And then they have to have a whole entire movie.
[109:21.81]The Grand Thunderbird is awoken.
[109:23.29]Well, shit!
[109:24.23]Hold on!
[109:28.54]This is quite the fucking party, look at this!
[109:31.18]There's balloons everywhere!
[109:35.24]This can't be good for the environment.
[109:40.30]This is really messed up, actually.
[109:47.11]Letting out that many helium balloons into the atmosphere?
[109:49.39]These birds are awesome.
[110:00.69]A bird mask.
[110:02.00]Jerma did zero damage.
[110:03.64]Actually, I did an absolute shitload because of my two birds.
[110:08.36]I can't reach with the staff.
[110:09.84]The birds did a ton of damage.
[110:10.92]What are you guys talking about?
[110:20.39]Another bird.
[110:21.81]Another bird.
[110:23.81]I want us to both have the armor set.
[110:31.89]You'll see why.
[110:32.63]You'll fucking see, dude.
[110:39.80]Okay, it's just out of reach.
[110:43.26]Look at my birds doing all that work.
[110:44.72]Is he dead?
[110:52.16]Yeah.
[110:54.79]Everything I get, Star has to have, too.
[110:57.37]How many ingots do you have?
[110:58.95]I am the little brother.
[110:59.69]I have, uh, three.
[111:05.20]Hand him over.
[111:13.33]I was gonna wait till you said please, but it is your game.
[111:16.05]I'm making him for you.
[111:17.21]It is your server.
[111:18.15]Okay, we need to kill him, like, maybe one more time.
[111:20.89]This guy's having a... Are they having, like, a tea party on a grave?
[111:38.90]He's so loud.
[111:40.06]He is pretty loud.
[111:41.34]He's a screecher.
[111:56.76]He's too far.
[111:57.34]He goes too far away from me.
[112:00.06]You have the thing that goes across the whole screen.
[112:01.64]I don't.
[112:05.74]Jerma, you're contributing.
[112:07.56]A deadly didgeridoo.
[112:11.97]What's a... Why do you have... What is that for your head?
[112:17.01]Uh, it's for bard inspiration.
[112:19.59]They can only cast, like, that many times for using music.
[112:22.83]Oh.
[112:24.43]And then it buffs people near you and stuff, which also isn't magic damage.
[112:30.43]So where are all these people?
[112:32.17]There are like hundreds of thousands of people at this party.
[112:36.90]The painter showed up.
[112:38.22]He can just go die.
[112:43.02]I came for the party.
[112:44.00]So what do you say?
[112:50.72]Go in my inventory and what?
[112:52.83]I gave you the armor.
[112:55.46]That's all you have now, right?
[112:56.64]Because you gave me the helmet.
[112:57.80]I don't see any armor.
[112:59.70]It's on the roof.
[113:01.06]Oh.
[113:01.92]Armor on roof.
[113:04.15]Is the painter going to be okay?
[113:10.53]Let him die.
[113:12.03]Seriously, let him die.
[113:13.14]Why?
[113:13.42]Is he bad?
[113:14.68]He doesn't do anything.
[113:17.66]Alright, so we... We don't want it on.
[113:19.00]Unless you want two birds, but this makes you double jump.
[113:21.64]I kind of... I want two birds, I think, but hold on.
[113:25.40]I can do the helmet.
[113:27.16]No, I can do the greaves.
[113:30.26]And you need the full set for the double jump.
[113:33.89]The two birds are really good.
[113:42.61]No, I'm going to hold on.
[113:43.33]I want the two birds.
[113:43.93]Okay.
[113:47.89]Yeah.
[113:48.83]I like the two birds.
[113:50.41]And there's another armor set here that we could make you, but these are so annoying.
[113:57.91]This painter.
[114:02.54]Get him, Bruno!
[114:07.32]Should we actually let him die?
[114:10.22]Yeah.
[114:11.60]you sure okay let's go let's go chop chop chop chop what does he do okay I'm gonna what does he do he like lets you he put you can put wallpaper in a room uh cool yeah why do you want to get wizard of Afghanistan yellow paint rainbow wallpaper come on brown paint white paint gray paint pink violet purple blue sky blue
[114:44.55]My room is bigger than this.
[114:56.17]I need a room for like a bed and shit.
[114:58.13]No, you're a prison.
[114:59.93]They're all prison rooms.
[115:04.46]Look, it's a candy cane.
[115:07.34]Oh man, you could be really slim and slender just like a candy cane.
[115:11.50]Oh, whoa, what?
[115:15.06]Alright, get the fuck out of my room.
[115:17.46]Get out of my room.
[115:19.93]Get out of my room.
[115:20.71]Okay.
[115:27.91]If you need me, just right-click me and I'll give you something.
[115:30.23]Oh, let's... I wanna leave.
[115:31.41]Let's go.
[115:32.47]Who's up there?
[115:33.93]Somebody has to show up.
[115:34.68]Alright, let's go.
[115:39.30]Who was that?
[115:40.00]I don't know.
[115:42.14]Oh, that's the sand guy.
[115:44.73]Yeah, try double jumping up here.
[115:46.47]Sand guy.
[115:48.27]Yeah, I don't know.
[115:50.93]Put the full set on.
[115:51.83]Yeah, but I'm going to lose my bird.
[115:55.82]You're better off having the double birds.
[116:04.00]That's so good, though.
[116:06.13]This is not a double jump.
[116:07.65]This is a jetpack.
[116:10.07]Yeah, here's a book.
[116:11.15]Take that book.
[116:12.17]You can shoot things at a distance with that book.
[116:14.53]What?
[116:16.53]It's a spell.
[116:17.47]Is it better than the Biothor?
[116:20.65]Well, it shoots further.
[116:22.01]You're complaining about not being able to shoot far enough.
[116:24.91]You can have two.
[116:26.87]Oh, okay.
[116:27.27]Oh, alright.
[116:34.18]Oh, cool.
[116:35.06]How fast can I do it?
[116:39.47]This is very overwhelming, but it's very fun.
[116:41.85]Alright, hold on.
[116:43.57]10 mana, 5 mana.
[116:45.65]Fast.
[116:47.51]16 damage, 4% crit.
[116:48.25]Alright, this is good.
[116:53.27]Golden duck.
[116:56.71]Can you actually do anything with the gold animals, besides think they're cool?
[117:05.85]That answer is no.
[117:06.66]I thought that was a soundboard that you just put in.
[117:10.25]That boing was... Oh, no!
[117:12.33]Boing!
[117:12.73]The jump makes you go forward a little faster.
[117:17.14]Don't leave me hanging.
[117:18.62]Oh, yeah, you don't have it.
[117:26.04]You can sell them for gold.
[117:28.46]So why are you killing them?
[117:31.28]Okay, Jerma.
[117:32.92]Go through the process of, like, taming an animal.
[117:35.73]Do it.
[117:38.07]Is it a pain in the ass?
[117:40.05]I don't know how to do it.
[117:42.62]It's 10 gold.
[117:45.86]Put them in a net and sell.
[117:48.42]We only imprison people here.
[117:51.86]Hey, I'm not the expert.
[117:52.68]You're supposed to be the expert.
[117:57.54]So what's the current objective now?
[117:59.58]The current objective is to go back to that corruption area, the purple area.
[118:04.42]And when you destroy three of those shadow orbs, it summons a boss.
[118:08.73]Oh.
[118:09.51]We want to kill that boss.
[118:11.19]Because then we can mine the fossil.
[118:14.71]And then when we can mine the fossil, we can go to hell.
[118:21.84]This is cool.
[118:23.90]Not on expert mode?
[118:26.56]No.
[118:27.26]What would expert mode change?
[118:30.54]Bosses get more health, deal more damage, and you die a lot.
[118:36.68]and it takes like three times as long to play through and do anything I uh we would not have killed one boss yet hmm it's good I've got like a spelunking potion what the hell is that it's way more good yeah you get there's more interesting drops an expert but I I
[119:02.09]You wouldn't want to play it.
[119:04.17]I probably wouldn't.
[119:04.83]Not on my first ever time playing the game, really.
[119:07.55]You don't even know what anything is.
[119:10.31]And you're like, where am I not expert mode?
[119:13.37]Would I talk like that?
[119:15.18]No, the other guy would talk like that.
[119:19.24]Oh.
[119:27.86]Dark.
[119:28.25]Too dark.
[119:30.25]Holy shit, thank god.
[119:32.79]This little thing just saved my life.
[119:35.23]No, it didn't.
[119:44.22]How did you even get over there?
[119:45.16]Oh, you have a double jump.
[119:46.28]Right.
[119:46.54]I can't just follow you blindly.
[119:47.98]How do you heal yourself?
[120:01.52]I can't mine this?
[120:03.12]No.
[120:03.86]Alright, I gotta put a platform down.
[120:04.84]You can put on that helmet.
[120:07.03]Especially for this boss trust.
[120:08.81]But, you're gonna need it.
[120:13.33]Let's sacrifice the one bird for now.
[120:17.23]Really?
[120:17.67]I just had my fucking head on the sand.
[120:19.47]You have to hold space, you spend longer.
[120:23.17]Alright, I think I'm good.
[120:28.96]A horrible chill goes down your spine.
[120:34.82]okay take this as well musket and I'm taking this for what specific reason because it does 32 damage oh that's a lot um use that as your long range uh your vile thorn will be a lot better on this boss though okay alright vile thorn on the box
[121:05.22]don't don't walk in those bombs I need more light down here man I'm gonna have to put some hold on if we're gonna fight a boss like right now I need to be able to see come back come back what you need to start doing is go to the left and make a rope up to the surface make a rope up to the surface yeah
[121:29.57]Remember, you can't mine through this, so go back to where we came down and make it as easy as possible to get up to the surface.
[121:37.19]What?
[121:41.76]How did I fall?
[121:44.08]There's too much pressure.
[121:46.54]Was it here?
[121:50.34]Was it right here?
[121:59.57]Just for me.
[122:03.93]Ow.
[122:06.07]I'm gonna die.
[122:08.67]I'm fine, I'm fine.
[122:10.03]I need you.
[122:11.09]It's fucking dark down here.
[122:36.16]Uh, tell me when you're on the surface.
[122:37.39]Uh, not on the surface.
[122:40.27]Here's why I'm ready to pull the trigger on Fuck Fiesta.
[122:42.81]Uh, do not do that yet.
[122:43.63]Dude, am I out of torches?
[123:10.46]And we still, like, really only have 100 health each.
[123:13.62]Um... His rope sucks, just warning you.
[123:17.71]Okay.
[123:21.13]I... I need light.
[123:29.34]I don't know where the fuck I'm going, man.
[123:31.02]I don't know what I'm doing.
[123:35.16]Oh my god.
[123:37.00]I don't know what I'm doing.
[123:38.94]Make it as easy as possible to get to the top.
[123:43.00]Help!
[123:44.96]I got stuck down here.
[123:46.62]Alright.
[123:51.74]You know what?
[123:52.16]You just wait on the top and I have a potion to tell it to you.
[123:56.64]Why do I have to wait down here?
[123:57.82]Because a giant worm is going to come out of the ground.
[124:04.36]And if you're inside these tunnels when it appears, you just get wormed.
[124:09.72]I'm on the surface.
[124:12.70]Okay.
[124:13.58]Can you build a platform above the ground with wood platforms?
[124:18.40]Do you have any?
[124:19.34]Yeah, platform above the ground.
[124:20.70]You want me to just go like the other one you had?
[124:23.67]Yeah, yeah.
[124:24.69]I don't have any fucking torches, though.
[124:29.17]I can't see shit.
[124:37.52]I'm going to be very Frank and upfront about this.
[124:42.58]I don't know if I'm okay.
[124:43.30]I can't do this.
[124:46.92]It's okay to admit it.
[124:48.24]I'm not going to be like, yeah, sure, man.
[124:50.18]Here we go.
[124:50.76]I'm kind of stuck.
[124:53.96]I'm kind of overwhelmed.
[124:56.12]I'm going to summon the boss.
[124:58.04]Okay.
[124:58.60]I need wood.
[124:59.40]Hold on.
[125:00.46]And then I'm going to teleport to you.
[125:04.06]And then we're just going to make the best of it with our double jump.
[125:07.38]Okay, hold on.
[125:07.98]Tell Jerma to turn his brightness up.
[125:09.35]No, I'm enjoying this.
[125:13.37]Where'd I go?
[125:13.73]Hey, I'm doing fine.
[125:31.84]Doing good.
[125:32.44]I can handle this.
[125:34.52]Hey, I can handle it.
[125:36.69]Don't worry.
[125:37.63]You're so far away.
[125:43.09]I'm a little overwhelming.
[125:44.37]I need... You see, if it were me playing, I would probably still be cutting down trees and building a house.
[125:52.41]We're fighting monsters and getting new gear.
[125:56.32]I would have just built a candy cane house.
[125:59.72]Alright, hold on.
[126:00.16]You don't have enough candy cane.
[126:03.50]What the fuck?
[126:03.98]I'll be here.
[126:11.00]I'm just gonna wait for you and do some other stuff.
[126:18.37]I'm just gonna keep him.
[126:20.93]Help get me, please!
[126:22.73]Alright, just... I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.
[126:28.23]I'm losing my fucking mind.
[126:29.93]Okay.
[126:30.75]Torch.
[126:36.04]I need- Just give me a bunch.
[126:39.72]How many of these do I have?
[126:40.42]What is he overwhelmed by?
[126:41.66]I don't get it.
[126:42.66]Oh, it made tiki torches.
[126:44.30]Oh, fuck.
[126:46.98]What am I overwhelmed by?
[126:48.17]I don't know.
[126:50.33]It's like a lot to take in in an hour.
[127:07.52]Get out of here!
[127:08.28]Alright.
[127:18.21]I need to, like, relax.
[127:19.47]Because I'm, like, actually, like, panic getting overwhelmed by all the shit in the inventory.
[127:24.21]And all the things in the game.
[127:25.25]Alright.
[127:26.13]Okay.
[127:28.91]Get my book up here.
[127:30.17]No, I don't need that.
[127:30.81]Okay, I have potions.
[127:34.20]Alright, let me just deposit this bullshit.
[127:36.04]I don't even know what the fuck I want with all this.
[127:41.22]No, hold it here.
[127:44.81]That's fine.
[127:45.45]That's fine.
[127:47.23]Get rid of everything else, I guess.
[127:58.97]Alright, so I have...
[128:02.27]stupid fucking tiki torches man I'm gonna build the thing that you wanted to build right you're gonna you're gonna do it are you sure probably not uh I'm worried about you is there wood even in do we have any wood I died I cut down trees on your way back but I died there's plenty I died I fell down whole I think you missed that part yeah but you still have all your things
[128:30.27]Buy torches from the merchant.
[128:31.93]You see, here's the thing.
[128:33.01]He has locked like seven people in here.
[128:36.85]I don't know what any of these people do besides this guy.
[128:39.01]He sells dynamite.
[128:39.87]I'm worried about you.
[128:52.24]No, I'm good.
[128:58.17]Rescue them.
[128:59.05]I just started breaking them out.
[129:01.12]Okay.
[129:02.96]I need to come back.
[129:03.84]I have so much junk in my inventory.
[129:05.90]Alright.
[129:08.96]It's just too dark.
[129:12.51]What is your gamma at?
[129:13.71]Tell me what it is.
[129:18.37]Where is gamma?
[129:19.01]I don't know.
[129:22.45]I don't know.
[129:30.12]It's in NVIDIA settings.
[129:37.27]What is Parallax?
[129:40.87]For real?
[129:44.09]Alright.
[129:45.35]You're coming back, right?
[129:46.59]I'm in here with you.
[130:00.77]So, you want to deposit stuff?
[130:05.19]I'm doing a drop.
[130:09.31]Do you need torches?
[130:10.12]I can make you torches.
[130:12.44]No, I have torches.
[130:16.04]I figured it out.
[130:20.82]I have potions, I have torches, I have food.
[130:22.68]In video settings, change lighting to white.
[130:32.93]Why is it like a sandstorm?
[130:33.81]I don't know.
[130:40.60]I'll get like 50.
[130:42.48]Is 50 torches good?
[130:45.64]You should get more.
[130:46.75]More than 50?
[130:47.13]Okay.
[130:48.51]Because you'll always be using torches.
[130:50.03]There's no reason to not have more.
[130:52.67]If you can make more.
[130:53.17]Like 300?
[130:58.44]I mean, how much do you panic when you don't have a torch?
[131:01.03]Do you ever want that to happen again?
[131:02.45]No, never.
[131:03.07]Okay.
[131:03.31]So I've got gun, I've got food, I've got health.
[131:09.89]I've got my bread.
[131:11.72]Alright.
[131:13.30]Are we good?
[131:15.20]To start this?
[131:35.53]Why would you build a house in the desert?
[131:37.31]I don't know.
[131:37.73]This is not my... I'm just along for the ride, guys.
[131:55.71]Do I know that shift... Yeah, I know shift takes out the best tool, right?
[131:58.33]Yeah.
[131:59.85]I think also...
[132:12.05]Never mind, ignore me.
[132:16.63]That's such a cool item.
[132:29.66]Oh my god.
[132:31.30]I don't take fall damage.
[132:32.10]Imagine you died from up there.
[132:33.60]That would have been so funny.
[132:34.50]I would have laughed.
[132:37.21]Normally these things don't let you jump a second time.
[132:41.82]You know what we also need is an anti-gravity potion.
[132:45.90]What is that?
[132:47.56]It turns gravity upside down, so you fly up in the air, and there's planets in the sky.
[132:53.13]Do a zombie impression?
[132:56.49]I feel like... I feel like that's a star thing.
[132:58.27]That's a star request.
[133:00.59]Here, take mana crystal.
[133:04.00]Mana, uh... Just take that right now, right?
[133:06.82]Yeah.
[133:09.16]Uh, so you brought wood, right?
[133:13.43]Hold on, let me... You brought wood, right?
[133:17.85]I have wood platforms, yes.
[133:20.07]Okay.
[133:21.47]I have 39 of them.
[133:23.53]Is that not enough?
[133:25.75]Is that not enough?
[133:26.83]You didn't tell me a number!
[133:27.91]I didn't know if... I needed more than, like, 40.
[133:31.21]39's not enough?
[133:33.48]You need, like, 200.
[133:35.32]I need 200!
[133:36.32]Okay, well, let's get them now.
[133:40.44]Alright, I don't even have an axe anymore.
[133:43.95]I'll get it, I'll get it.
[133:48.81]I'm just along for the ride.
[133:50.67]I'm just along for the ride.
[133:56.83]I'm a seafood guy, you know?
[134:00.15]I see food, I eat it, you know?
[134:03.81]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[134:12.78]Indeed.
[134:16.25]Okay, I've got... You see how long this took?
[134:20.07]I have 340.
[134:20.63]Okay, so I have a lot too.
[134:24.83]We're ready.
[134:26.15]Honestly, Tim gave 50 more dolls.
[134:28.37]This is addressed to you, so you might want to listen to this.
[134:31.07]Oh, this is to me?
[134:31.95]Yes.
[134:32.65]Tim, 96, gave 50 more dolls.
[134:36.53]And they said, don't tell Star this.
[134:38.28]Oh, okay.
[134:39.62]I won't read the rest then.
[134:42.40]I brought some people.
[134:51.11]By the way, spoiler alert.
[134:52.61]He said I'm much more handsome than you.
[134:55.89]That's fine.
[134:57.75]I told him.
[135:02.10]How... Okay, I feel like this is cheating.
[135:04.80]You're making your own final destination.
[135:11.58]You wait there.
[135:15.11]You can do that, right?
[135:16.23]I can do that.
[135:24.44]Finally, I can see the sun.
[135:27.98]I can see the sun.
[135:29.18]Alright, what are this guy's mechanics?
[135:31.12]What does he do?
[135:33.34]You know that first worm we fought that died really quickly?
[135:36.07]Yeah, I guess.
[135:37.37]It's one of those worms that are common enemies, but he splits into segments, and you have to kill every single part of the worm.
[135:46.05]Worm that flies around.
[135:47.92]So if you're above the ground, it makes it a lot easier to dodge because he's going to come up at you.
[136:03.41]Okay, are you ready?
[136:06.80]I am, I guess, as ready as I'm going to be.
[136:10.48]I'm not sure what that means, but I guess so.
[136:13.86]Eater of worlds.
[136:14.90]Segments left.
[136:15.65]57.
[136:16.21]That seems like a lot.
[136:20.45]Yep.
[136:23.37]Oh, these stick to the fucking thing.
[136:26.84]That's him.
[136:27.70]Down there.
[136:43.52]I didn't though, I'm fine.
[136:54.74]Nice!
[136:55.12]Alright, careful, he's coming in, he's wrapping around you!
[136:59.64]Careful!
[137:10.45]You know, he's like 30 worms now.
[137:11.99]Yeah, he's a lot of worms.
[137:12.91]He's gonna eat the world next.
[137:41.16]Oh, that hurt.
[137:45.46]Inside of my nose, itchiness has ever been in my whole life.
[137:50.46]Somebody put, like, sneezing powder in my nose.
[137:52.59]They just came in here and just blew it up in my nose.
[137:58.11]Is that it?
[137:59.13]I think that's the last one more.
[138:01.54]There's two segments left.
[138:04.86]Scratch it, I can't.
[138:12.40]You did it.
[138:12.70]I did it.
[138:17.59]Alright.
[138:17.75]You okay?
[138:18.37]You're like sniffing in your microphone, and I really appreciate it.
[138:20.85]So what did we get?
[138:23.69]Oh, hold on.
[138:26.79]This thing is actually really good.
[138:30.57]They were just lined up on the bridge, and I could just run this way and go like that.
[138:38.14]Yeah, we got Star, the Master Looter.
[138:40.71]Every single one of those little splits drops demonite ore and shadow scales.
[138:44.89]Make sure you've picked them all up.
[138:46.15]That's around here.
[138:46.77]Yeah, I've been running around looking around.
[138:49.74]On the top here.
[138:52.98]He dropped a healing staff.
[138:55.18]Healing staff.
[138:57.86]Am I doing lines of coke to be able to play Terraria?
[139:01.30]What are you thinking?
[139:03.51]What are you thinking with that nonsense?
[139:07.45]Get that out of my chapel.
[139:11.26]We'll do it for a lot less.
[139:15.10]Yeah, hey, Digging to Hell is still the title of the stream.
[139:17.44]When are we going?
[139:17.94]Uh, we should be able to go now.
[139:24.32]So that ore you're talking about.
[139:25.34]I have a lot of it.
[139:28.01]Yeah, uh, Recall Potion.
[139:29.45]Go back.
[139:29.73]Hold on.
[139:32.31]Okay.
[139:43.42]and I'm going to give it to the Jeffrey, and he's going to tell me what it does.
[139:45.94]Okay, I've made the pickaxe, so you don't need to make one.
[139:49.55]Okay.
[139:51.57]Okay, so I can make Demonite Brick?
[139:54.73]Demonite Bar?
[139:57.59]Why would you make Demonite Brick?
[140:00.39]Just because you think it looks cool.
[140:02.53]Oh, okay.
[140:03.25]So Demonite Bar... I think he has a summon that's pretty good that should be a little bit better than... So do I have to make a bar and then put the bar in here?
[140:11.14]Yeah, make a bar at the furnace.
[140:14.54]And then... Here, I'll drop you the shadow scales.
[140:18.33]Here's the rest of the bars.
[140:19.37]I just needed the, um... pickaxe.
[140:23.71]And you can do whatever you want with those.
[140:25.41]Ooh, okay.
[140:26.85]There's a lot of stuff here.
[140:32.83]Fisher of Souls.
[140:33.47]20% more fishing power.
[140:37.88]There's a whole fishing thing, I've never done it.
[140:40.62]You would probably love fishing.
[140:41.56]What the fuck is going on?
[140:42.46]Uh, alright.
[140:51.73]Oh, I did put the scales in trash.
[140:54.97]Does that mean... Did I accidentally trash the bars?
[140:59.27]You threw the bars in the trash?
[141:07.96]Where's the... Don't I have Demon Ore still?
[141:11.67]Yeah.
[141:12.39]Oh.
[141:13.35]Okay, if you need any more shadow skills, I have 20.
[141:16.75]Is there a way to quickly just go to... Ah, there we go.
[141:21.41]When you're crafting, there is a button you can press that makes it show all on screen.
[141:24.54]Yeah, it's a lot easier.
[141:25.40]Alright.
[141:30.14]So now, I'm going to look at this again.
[141:33.86]I tried to shoot him.
[141:38.93]Jester's shirt, Jester's mask.
[141:42.51]Minion damage, ooh.
[141:43.59]This increases minion damage by 15, by 20%.
[141:51.09]Increases your max number of minions.
[141:54.81]Oh, man.
[141:58.43]So wait, I can do one, two?
[142:01.63]Two extra minions with this set on?
[142:06.15]Uh, yes.
[142:06.95]Yeah, I'm gonna do this.
[142:13.52]What does this cost?
[142:14.31]7 defense.
[142:18.87]I need 14 bars, 5 spirit droplets, and 40 bones.
[142:25.95]I don't have those materials, do I?
[142:27.50]We cannot get those yet.
[142:28.42]And if you're seeing some really weird items, especially items that are animated, we cannot get those yet.
[142:33.66]Oh.
[142:34.88]I think, generally speaking, the further you scroll down the list, the less likely we are to craft them.
[142:39.73]Oh.
[142:41.01]Oh.
[142:41.87]Really?
[142:43.48]Yep, you're just gonna have to keep playing the game.
[142:44.94]Cinnamon bar?
[142:46.00]No.
[142:46.48]Due to the magic storage, we need emeralds before we can make the heart.
[142:51.39]Light's bane.
[142:52.99]Demon bow.
[142:53.81]Is there another, uh, is there like a demon wand?
[142:59.17]If it's not on that list, there isn't one.
[143:02.25]I think vile thorn's better than... Dark wave.
[143:04.47]Here we go.
[143:05.05]Dark wave.
[143:08.01]Sends out a wave of dark energy.
[143:09.49]What does it take?
[143:09.99]Ooh, I can make this.
[143:11.65]18 versus... 10?
[143:18.60]What's the book?
[143:20.26]16?
[143:23.64]The book is better.
[143:24.24]Fast speed versus fast speed.
[143:28.76]6 mana versus 5.
[143:35.08]That's not very good.
[143:35.58]The walking goldfish in Desert Storm.
[143:39.35]Yep.
[143:39.55]16 versus 18.
[143:43.57]I'm gonna go- I'll try it.
[143:45.78]I'm gonna try it.
[143:46.50]I'm gonna make the, uh, the Dark Wave.
[143:48.94]I forgot to craft the, uh, Lion Cthulhu.
[143:57.92]I need your money.
[143:59.36]My money?
[143:59.76]What do you mean, my money?
[144:01.34]Your gold.
[144:02.04]The gold money you have.
[144:03.13]I have 82 silver.
[144:04.81]I don't have very much.
[144:06.87]You don't have any gold pieces?
[144:08.25]No.
[144:10.35]Do you have any dynamite?
[144:11.15]Uh, I have 27 bombs.
[144:15.82]I'm gonna try this new wand out, though.
[144:20.64]Ooh, that's pretty good.
[144:22.64]It's fast.
[144:23.70]We need money.
[144:32.65]And I am not joking around, Jerma.
[144:35.55]Uh, I'm gonna sell some stuff.
[144:41.33]Uh, what about the Shadow Scale?
[144:42.71]What can I do with these?
[144:44.63]They... are also used with the Demonite Ore, I'm pretty sure.
[144:48.85]Just for random recipes.
[144:50.25]They're just... yeah.
[144:52.11]I... am a little unsure.
[144:54.19]I think they just kinda also use the same stuff.
[144:56.53]I just feel like I shouldn't even delete any of these things or sell any of them.
[145:01.65]I just don't know.
[145:05.55]I'm just depositing all my shit, and I don't even know what to do with it.
[145:08.95]Buy a net for the gold critters.
[145:10.45]I'll do that.
[145:14.01]A bug net?
[145:16.31]Can you catch them in a bug net?
[145:20.13]Can you get the duck in a bug net?
[145:22.09]Can you?
[145:22.44]I don't know.
[145:24.06]Oh, okay, I got this in, yeah.
[145:29.62]Alright, what can I do with the shadow skill stuff?
[145:33.78]That shit didn't...
[145:39.73]Can you organize this stuff?
[145:41.71]I don't know what to do.
[145:43.47]Eventually, we're going to make a Super Stash that will auto-organize it.
[145:47.27]Oh, okay.
[145:48.17]We just really need Emerald before we can do that.
[145:52.87]Antlion Doll.
[145:54.31]Rune of Bleeding.
[145:55.29]Dealing critical damage restores life.
[146:00.46]I can't make any of these, though, I don't think.
[146:03.58]Ooh!
[146:03.80]Ooh!
[146:04.30]Ooh!
[146:04.52]Ooh!
[146:07.63]Sorcerer's Pants, Sorcerer's Robe, I just do much more magic damage.
[146:13.87]Um, if you want better magic damage, we need to find the Meteor.
[146:18.13]Should I just get some of the, should I just do these now?
[146:20.85]Just to have it?
[146:23.31]No, those are really, you're better off with the double jump for now.
[146:27.09]Really?
[146:27.33]I think so, yeah.
[146:29.21]I mean, if you want to make them, and you want to look like a wizard.
[146:33.54]I'm not gonna stop you.
[146:35.05]Actually, I need Disciple's Hat.
[146:36.39]I don't have enough.
[146:40.89]Alright, well, let's just keep going.
[146:42.39]Let's just keep doing whatever.
[146:43.15]Make sure I have stuff.
[146:46.45]I have food.
[146:47.23]Okay, I got the bug net.
[146:50.68]I need some more potions.
[146:57.80]Those are very important.
[146:59.74]How much money do I have?
[147:01.98]I can buy a ton of these.
[147:05.26]Get the 20.
[147:06.82]20 and 20.
[147:07.02]Yeah, I think so.
[147:13.99]The Disciple Set is easy to make?
[147:17.67]There's an upgraded version of it with one of these mods?
[147:21.91]And we would need, like, a loom...
[147:24.29]It's like a three-step process to get to a loom, to make silk, to start.
[147:30.99]If it is what I think you're talking about.
[147:32.44]Disciples hat.
[147:36.32]How can I see what that takes?
[147:37.98]I don't know.
[147:39.66]Alright, I'm coming down.
[147:41.64]I'm going to store this stuff.
[147:43.90]Wait, I'm coming back up in like one second.
[147:45.59]You're coming back up here.
[147:47.17]Yeah.
[147:48.71]I found a bunch of stuff that just fell really quick.
[147:50.53]I'm going to look for gold animals.
[147:56.17]And is it as easy as just catching it like that?
[148:03.83]Kill the pig for money.
[148:09.13]Really?
[148:09.39]Does it put a dot?
[148:22.91]Oh, we don't need money anymore.
[148:23.97]I got it.
[148:25.15]This is a dot.
[148:26.21]I like this a lot.
[148:26.93]I gotta... Wait.
[148:37.56]I just like, threw him.
[148:59.11]Just hang on here.
[148:59.69]It's safe in here.
[149:00.35]Stop.
[149:02.75]He's not gold, so it doesn't matter.
[149:08.36]Kill pig.
[149:08.96]He's got... Star, should we kill the pig?
[149:14.73]Yes.
[149:15.15]He drops bacon and a lot of money.
[149:27.92]You're not doing it.
[149:28.54]Why are you not killing the pig?
[149:30.58]I'm out of mana.
[149:34.88]I gave you a musket.
[149:37.48]That's really powerful.
[149:38.54]I'm going to waste that on a little pig?
[149:42.34]Yeah.
[149:43.08]I could buy you a thousand musket balls.
[149:50.33]That was nine gold.
[149:52.43]Yeah.
[149:53.47]What?
[149:54.47]Just buy as many musket balls as you want.
[149:58.75]Come over here.
[149:59.97]Hold on.
[150:00.32]That's a lot of money.
[150:04.30]Sandstorm is one gold.
[150:10.72]Cactus fruit.
[150:14.47]Invest.
[150:15.21]Invest.
[150:15.91]It's the big moment.
[150:16.93]Step aside.
[150:17.79]Step aside.
[150:18.41]What am I doing?
[150:22.59]Now we can go to hell.
[150:27.41]What?
[150:29.65]It's that easy to do that?
[150:32.29]Yeah.
[150:36.38]How much does that cost?
[150:39.34]15 dynamite, desert fossil, rope.
[150:43.74]And just go straight all the way down?
[150:47.42]Yeah.
[150:48.31]So we're just skipping the whole game?
[150:51.13]No.
[150:51.71]Not at all.
[151:05.36]I don't have any blocks.
[151:08.04]I don't know why I like this one spot.
[151:10.98]What's the point of this?
[151:11.68]What do you mean?
[151:15.10]People are saying we're actually skipping the whole game.
[151:17.61]We're not skipping the whole game.
[151:22.59]How do we... Are you sure you didn't just make a well?
[151:24.75]Yeah.
[151:31.83]You can drown in there.
[151:40.66]We're under water right now, dude.
[151:42.02]Should we not be doing this?
[151:43.66]No, we're okay.
[151:45.14]We need to get it to the bottom and then cut a hole in the wall so the water goes out the wall so that we can get it on the lava so that we can get up spitting.
[151:58.01]I feel not accomplished at all.
[152:02.99]You've dug to hell.
[152:04.03]What do you want?
[152:06.83]Can I not go anymore?
[152:08.51]No, there's the bottom.
[152:11.16]Did I just get a Hellforge?
[152:18.46]Uh... So we're just... Help me.
[152:29.91]Jerma, this is still the beginning of the game.
[152:31.55]Don't worry.
[152:35.60]Um... Okay.
[152:36.72]Okay.
[152:42.64]What happened to the rope?
[152:46.38]Alright, so we're just gonna go down here and just mine and dig and grab things and attack?
[152:52.20]Yeah, so there's a whole bunch of really annoying things that spawn.
[152:54.50]And if you... You see those demons on the left?
[152:56.24]See them?
[152:57.26]The demons on the left.
[152:59.98]Come over.
[153:01.54]Crash.
[153:08.58]Okay, actually, there's one over here, which is the perfect example of the thing we can't do.
[153:13.15]Okay.
[153:16.45]What is that exactly?
[153:17.97]Do you see the demon carrying a guy underneath his feet?
[153:21.81]Yes, I do.
[153:23.19]Okay, if he drops that in lava or you throw that guy in lava, if someone's a gigantic super wall thing, monster flesh thing, we're not ready.
[153:32.55]Don't kill one of those...
[153:35.18]Over the ground.
[153:36.78]Over lava, I mean.
[153:38.86]Okay.
[153:41.26]I guess I'll try not to do that.
[153:44.39]Okay, thank you.
[153:48.33]Did you make a demon bed?
[153:49.37]Oh, no, these are all already down here.
[153:52.49]We're in the demons' houses.
[153:54.67]They sleep in beds?
[153:55.57]Yeah, they're upset that we're here.
[154:02.75]I would assume a demon did not sleep in a bed.
[154:05.27]I always picture them hanging upside down with their eyes open, and they sleep like that.
[154:11.81]No, they have very comfortable obsidian beds.
[154:16.25]You cheated not only the game, but yourself.
[154:17.81]You didn't grow, you didn't improve.
[154:19.01]You took the shortcut and you didn't gain anything.
[154:22.29]You experienced a hollow victory.
[154:23.47]Nothing was risked.
[154:26.55]And nothing was gained.
[154:27.53]Ster.
[154:31.97]Please tell Jerma to get mods.
[154:35.34]What do you mean, mods?
[154:36.80]I don't know.
[154:37.32]I'm just relaying the message.
[154:38.44]It doesn't matter if it made any sense or not.
[154:48.35]Oh, because they're referring to the copypasta that was spammed like probably four or five thousand times.
[155:00.42]Do you have any normal blocks?
[155:02.06]Like placeable blocks?
[155:07.33]No, I have Demon Bikini, Hellforge, Obsidian.
[155:12.69]I don't have like any regular blocks, no.
[155:17.32]Sorry.
[155:27.40]what's that wormhole potion uh that teleports you to me oh that's cool what is this like demon clock demon clock the clock I got it he's got it I got it I got the clock oh is that an emerald boober
[155:59.09]There's a chest down there.
[156:02.97]Duh, you can't open those.
[156:04.23]What?
[156:04.55]Aww, that's unfortunate.
[156:15.89]I'm pretty sure that's enough em- we might need one emerald.
[156:19.95]So what's the next boss we can summon?
[156:23.49]um we never killed the eye but that's like the first boss you're supposed to kill I don't even think it matters anymore um we can fight crabbylon sounds fun to me let's fight crap I don't think we have a way to breathe under water one of the demons dropped a sword that's a piece of we could be doing the wall of flesh
[156:51.56]Do you want this?
[156:55.86]Blade Crest Oath Sword.
[156:58.44]You're gonna die.
[156:59.68]What?
[157:01.42]These guys shoot through walls.
[157:02.98]Oh.
[157:03.10]You're getting shot.
[157:04.85]What do you have for a sword?
[157:09.17]What the fuck is even here?
[157:10.21]Oh, what?
[157:10.65]Just drop it.
[157:12.87]Here.
[157:13.61]This is not the place to read things.
[157:17.47]Come get the oversized sword here.

[157:54.32]That's magma.
[157:56.24]Oh, he just snuck one in.
[157:58.04]And then also we need to find life crystals because our max health could be like 200 right now.
[158:13.54]Yeah.
[158:24.81]magma ore how much do you think we need um I forget what magma armor does I don't think either of us are actually really going to use this but not much there's a chest over there um where the did you come from he lives here
[158:53.76]Let's take over that chest.
[158:58.17]Some old magma ore down here.
[158:59.31]Don't want to pass this up.
[159:05.51]What the hell is that?
[159:07.09]Diamond?
[159:07.45]It was a ghost!
[159:09.23]What did it drop though?
[159:09.88]What's that?
[159:10.20]Uh, rune stones.
[159:14.92]This is a pretty good accessory you can make with them.
[159:16.94]I forget exactly what it needs.
[159:18.72]I know it needs ten rune stones.
[159:24.79]What's in the chest?
[159:25.97]This is for you.
[159:26.95]Take one of these.
[159:29.23]Help me!
[159:29.55]What do I do?
[159:30.57]What do I do?
[159:31.23]I'm on fire!
[159:31.81]You're dead.
[159:32.15]What do I do?
[159:33.23]You're dead.
[159:37.54]You know what you do?
[159:38.64]Is you respawn, you heal really quick, and then you use your wormhole potion.
[159:45.22]You press M and just click on me on the map and you'll teleport to me.
[159:50.46]I didn't know lava was that dangerous.
[159:53.97]Yeah, it's really... It does like 60 damage when you first touch it.
[159:59.22]Shit.
[159:59.74]Alright, so I can teleport to you.
[160:03.44]And then... Yeah.
[160:05.20]Drop off any items if you were full.
[160:07.58]I mean, that demonic bone ash.
[160:10.08]I don't know.
[160:10.98]We need to make like a super stash and I gotta dig down.
[160:12.92]Yeah, I can make it now.
[160:13.86]I just found emeralds.
[160:17.05]I know that I've been putting in a lot of like useless shit.
[160:19.23]Actually, don't waste the level potion.
[160:22.02]Are you just gonna come back up?
[160:23.40]You got the sword, right?
[160:24.20]Yeah, and we're right alongside the fucking giant hole anyway.
[160:35.63]Quick stack.
[160:42.08]Restock sword items.
[160:43.54]Yeah, I got a lot of just random junk in there.
[160:45.78]I don't really know what half of it necessarily does.
[160:47.86]I'm gonna start setting up the thing.
[160:51.12]I'm going to put it in your candy cane room.
[160:52.78]Oh, thanks.
[160:54.40]Jerm, what Ster is making you do is like skipping to the end levels in Legend of Zelda with only two hearts.
[160:58.98]It is not.
[161:01.89]That was a real quick response to that.
[161:04.59]It is not.
[161:09.01]What I'm doing is like, you know in Diablo II when your friend gives you the waypoint to the catacombs?
[161:14.11]Mm-hmm.
[161:17.42]Alright, this will make Act 1 a little bit easier.
[161:19.73]You literally have base health, is what somebody said.
[161:26.31]Literally.
[161:27.93]Literally.
[161:29.97]Literally.
[161:31.53]Okay.
[161:33.55]So, let me take a look at what I got here.
[161:35.80]Demonic Bone Ash.
[161:37.62]Are you making the Super Stash?
[161:39.90]Yeah, I'm working on it.
[161:46.34]store your gold so you don't lose it next time oh we might be missing I didn't I was I didn't know you could deposit gold like I forgot it I didn't realize it took up slot I guess it does huh have you gotten one of those shadow diamonds by chance I don't think we would have another yet shadow diamond I have demonic bone ash magma ore
[162:11.14]No, no.
[162:13.50]It would be in one of these chests.
[162:15.12]I just dumped everything in here.
[162:16.84]We need to kill the eye, I think.
[162:21.78]The eye.
[162:24.87]Unless you miraculously found diamond.
[162:27.73]No, I don't think so.
[162:29.27]It would be stuffed in one of those boxes.
[162:31.71]Along with 15 weeds and 2 mushrooms.
[162:37.92]Wild Banner Regeneration.
[162:41.22]Slowly regenerates life.
[162:45.48]Oh.
[162:45.58]Plus 1% melee speed.
[162:48.98]That's cool.
[162:56.09]Fill in that cheater hole next to you.
[163:01.17]So, are we on?
[163:02.15]Are we out?
[163:04.66]I just have to, like, go touch a thing really quick.
[163:07.64]Go touch a thing.
[163:08.50]Alright, I will take this opportunity.
[163:09.46]Yeah, you don't have to come.
[163:11.29]I'm gonna take this opportunity to open this door.
[163:12.80]Fill up the cheater hole.
[163:18.08]I'm gonna go cover in our cheater... I'm gonna put a cheater manhole on our cheater sewer.
[163:23.10]I don't have any wood.
[163:41.21]I thought that was a diamond for a second, and I was gonna say, hey, I found a diamond.
[163:46.57]I hadn't kissed you.
[163:48.95]Water leaf, water leaf.
[163:52.67]Someone's got kaba.
[163:56.20]Do your best thick Boston accent.
[163:59.64]I can't.
[164:00.12]I don't even want to embarrass myself.
[164:01.24]I love this room, by the way, where you panic and 30 torches.
[164:05.28]Which one?
[164:05.66]It's spot over.
[164:08.84]Like, every time I walk by it.
[164:11.08]I'm gonna remember.
[164:12.04]Well, I was not trying to put a torch down.
[164:14.22]I was trying to hit the thing.
[164:15.52]I know.
[164:16.62]The monster that was in there.
[164:18.72]But it was very scary.
[164:22.70]It sure was.
[164:23.54]Alright.
[164:24.60]Where's my wooden panel here?
[164:31.65]Let's make some wooden... Let's make some wooden... That's fine.
[164:36.01]That looks good.
[164:37.89]Get that up there.
[164:41.08]Oh my, I should totally make like a bacon bridge.
[164:51.14]Dude, I think I'm going to, I'm going to make a, like my walls are going to be made of bacon.
[164:57.72]Hello?
[165:03.04]Hey, cap this shit.
[165:07.42]I missed it.
[165:15.77]I should really probably give you one of the life crystals.
[165:19.35]You really should stop hoarding all the items.
[165:22.85]I just gave you a band of regeneration.
[165:25.29]Yeah, you've probably been holding on to that.
[165:27.78]Ow.
[165:32.44]Is this your grave?
[165:33.16]Probably.
[165:34.84]Ster's extremities were detached by a zombie.
[165:44.54]We're the best monkey streamers.
[165:53.09]What are you doing?
[165:57.45]Keyboard mashing.
[165:58.23]Is it nighttime?
[165:58.91]Tell me when it's nighttime.
[166:07.24]Just look outside.
[166:08.10]Why do I have to tell you that?
[166:09.20]I'm underground.
[166:16.56]Just look outside.
[166:17.84]That was- that was a- Is this your grave?
[166:43.65]Oh, ow.
[167:08.24]What are you doing?
[167:08.68]What are you doing?
[167:15.06]Nothing.
[167:17.29]I'm sealing your fate, is what I'm doing.
[167:19.13]What does that mean?
[167:26.34]People that are watching my stream know, and they know what I'm doing.
[167:32.85]No guys, I'm not trying to like mouse trap him by having that hit him in the head.
[167:36.89]I was sending his gravestone to hell.
[167:38.73]That's kind of fucked up.
[167:58.40]I'm bored.
[168:00.12]What am I doing up here?
[168:01.14]Piggy!
[168:10.53]Is it daytime?
[168:12.47]Is it nighttime?
[168:13.13]Oh, fuck.
[168:13.53]It's been daytime for a very long time.
[168:15.25]No, it's not nighttime.
[168:16.37]I said it wrong.
[168:17.61]It's dusk right now.
[168:21.39]Is it nighttime?
[168:22.49]It's dusk.
[168:23.63]The sun's going down.
[168:26.44]Okay.
[168:34.04]Why do the pigs have so much health?
[168:38.18]Because they give so much gold and bacon.
[168:40.76]It's just kind of a joke.
[168:42.56]You know, you ever laugh before?
[168:43.83]Oh, right.
[168:44.43]Bacon, like money, epic bacon.
[169:14.64]11 gold.
[169:15.83]That's so much.
[169:17.01]What is a huge amount of money?
[169:19.53]Would you say?
[169:20.35]What's a decent amount of money in the game?
[169:23.47]For this early, like 30 gold is pretty solid.
[169:27.05]I mean, eventually you get platinum.
[169:29.65]Oh, gold turns into platinum.
[169:32.51]That's pretty awesome.
[169:33.15]But the most expensive things will be the traveling merchant has some things that sell for like 50 gold and usually they're goofs.
[169:40.10]Hmm.
[169:41.62]That's cool.
[169:42.00]And then beyond that, you buy dynamite.
[169:46.20]Is like one of the more expensive things.
[169:48.16]I stored my money.
[169:49.56]I got like 16 gold in that case.
[169:57.57]So in the meantime, is this something I should be doing while I'm waiting for you to collect the thing to go do Act 4 boss at level 2?
[170:06.02]You can build a rope that goes to the sky.
[170:07.82]Are you just trying to keep me occupied?
[170:11.71]No, no.
[170:12.49]There's, like, uh... There's a chest in the sky.
[170:16.55]That's, like, a keep the, like, keep, like, the dumb guy occupied joke, right?
[170:21.83]No.
[170:25.13]I'm, like, digging underground just finding random chests.
[170:28.23]Uh, alright.
[170:29.15]And in the sky there are planets and there are floating clouds with buildings on them.
[170:32.90]Um, alright.
[170:33.66]That sounds pretty fun.
[170:34.28]I'm gonna go do that.
[170:37.96]Where's, like, rope?
[170:40.73]How do you craft rope?
[170:45.01]Do you have cobweb?
[170:46.93]You haven't really been underground much.
[170:49.43]Can you buy rope?
[170:51.82]I'm not sure.
[170:53.66]They're so hard to find without flight.
[171:00.92]There's a lot more in Calamity mods, so the odds of you going up and there being a planet are actually pretty high.
[171:05.98]These are expensive, man.
[171:08.84]what it's 10 copper for one that's rope nothing there's nothing yeah are you sure yeah that's not expensive don't I need like 500 copper that's one bullet if don't I need I need like 500 of these
[171:42.54]okay here I have a gift for you do you like gifts I have a thousand rope check this I want to give you a mirror a mirror what does it do it does the same thing a recall potion does but it's infinite oh that's cool he was never gonna tell me it was nighttime
[172:06.01]I told you- what?
[172:07.19]I said, hey, it's- I said it's dusk, it's dusk, it's dusk.
[172:10.45]Like, that means, like, it's dusk and it's gonna be nighttime in a minute.
[172:16.52]This guy's a piece of shit.
[172:33.45]Okay.
[172:48.96]Ow.
[172:49.18]This thing's kind of a chump.
[172:53.57]It's the first boss in normal Terraria.
[172:56.93]Oh.
[173:08.63]Is there a way to regenerate mana?
[173:13.74]Better than simply... There are some items later.
[173:16.72]There's a lot of stuff, but not yet.
[173:18.78]Here, I'll give you the mana potions.
[173:20.74]I already have a bunch of lesser mana potions, but is there an effective... There's ways, like the health regeneration band I gave you can be turned into a mana regen.
[173:32.75]Actually, I think this orb I have can make something for you.
[173:36.47]Stand still.
[173:37.23]Oh, well, look at that.
[173:37.97]It dropped right next to us.
[173:41.73]So, did you get the thing we wanted?
[173:46.18]Okay, Fallen Star.
[173:49.23]We have to summon him again?
[173:52.21]No, I got the thing I needed.
[173:54.09]So what were you looking for?
[173:54.95]I was looking for a Shadow Diamond so I can start making that crafting thing.
[173:59.85]Okay, so I got three stars.
[174:02.13]Should I use these stars or do you need them for something important?
[174:05.03]No, use them.
[174:06.57]Do I just put them on my hotbar and use three?
[174:11.03]No, turn them into the Mana Crystal.
[174:14.89]Oh, you have to craft it like that, huh?
[174:18.09]Oh, okay.
[174:19.47]And here, take these two life crystals.
[174:21.61]I'm being kind.
[174:22.67]I'm sharing.
[174:24.27]Life crystal.
[174:26.85]So that gives me another health pool?
[174:30.89]It gives you 20 health per.
[174:33.32]Why did we not do this, like, an hour and a half ago?
[174:35.52]Because you have to find them, or it's just, like, random if you find it or not.
[174:40.50]Oh, okay.
[174:44.61]So we could have been looking underground for him, but clearly we didn't need it.
[174:47.13]Because we're so strong.
[174:50.63]Why does the guy have a health bar?
[174:51.63]Did he get hurt?
[174:53.41]Yeah.
[174:56.34]Alright, so are we going to do anything else we need to do at night time?
[175:00.70]No.
[175:02.68]What's your pickaxe?
[175:04.80]It's the sand.
[175:06.46]Shameful sandstone pickaxe.
[175:10.33]Look.
[175:13.38]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[175:15.28]I had the sandstone.
[175:16.00]I'll make you a demonite one.
[175:17.76]I mean, oh, that guy deposited them.
[175:19.65]I'm just putting, what about the magma stuff?
[175:23.97]I don't think we have enough yet.
[175:25.99]Let's see, magma ore makes a magma bar, right?
[175:30.97]Magma factory block, magma bar.
[175:34.48]You can't mine magma.
[175:37.22]Or you definitely can't mine hellstone, so take that pickaxe.
[175:41.57]So, this replaces this pickaxe now.
[175:43.63]I don't need this one anymore.
[175:44.85]You don't need it.
[175:47.21]This sandstone pickaxe is a piece of... Just shell it.
[175:49.52]Sell it.
[175:50.34]Sell it.
[175:51.32]Garbage.
[175:51.84]Alright.
[175:55.92]Do you have any more of that gingerbread... No.
[176:00.72]The gingerbread cookie?
[176:03.36]You know, the wall.
[176:06.82]What do you mean, what?
[176:08.36]The candy cane.
[176:10.98]It's in one of these chests.
[176:15.16]It's in one of them.
[176:16.72]I got it.
[176:17.82]I've been just, like, panicking and throwing stuff, everything I get in here.
[176:22.33]There's a superior ball of hurt in here.
[176:24.21]It's 33 melee damage.
[176:25.23]Is that good?
[176:26.93]It's okay.
[176:29.73]Okay, you need to, like, fact check me here.
[176:32.27]You have to, like, check my work because I've just been throwing random stuff that I don't even know what it does in there.
[176:45.19]So why are you making this bigger?
[176:46.07]For this.
[176:50.71]So it's nice and even.
[176:53.17]And this is a... This is complicated.
[176:57.07]So you make one of those and then you have to connect other storage components to it and then you click that and then it's basically a combined storage.
[177:08.08]Very cool.
[177:11.06]Very cool.
[177:11.98]Do you have any lead bars on you?
[177:15.57]No.
[177:17.83]Like I said, everything... I have two pieces of bacon on me.
[177:22.13]And, like, a clock.
[177:25.89]There's a new pig over here.
[177:28.86]New pig!
[177:29.44]Woo!
[177:32.90]Are we getting Luigi'd right now?
[177:35.38]Is it just spawning us pigs?
[177:36.50]Because, hey, you've been standing still for 15 straight minutes.
[177:39.27]You might need a pig.
[177:40.07]Nah, they actually spawn a lot when you're above ground.
[177:55.31]Fuck, dude.
[177:56.01]Do you have any wood?
[177:56.75]Is there wood in there?
[177:57.83]You got any threes?
[177:58.95]Dude, you got any threes?
[178:00.49]No, go fish.
[178:03.56]So, we should just go down and explore.
[178:05.54]Someone said, just explore.
[178:06.74]I said, you're doing a whole lot of nothing.
[178:10.46]I need to make this thing.
[178:14.51]And then we can do something.
[178:17.97]You just got all of that.
[178:18.83]I just, like, deposited that into your bank.
[178:20.43]Alright.
[178:21.03]Thank you.
[178:21.75]Why don't we just go explore?
[178:28.52]I'm going up to hell.
[178:31.14]Going up to hell?
[178:32.58]Oh, go.
[178:37.11]Shooting star.
[178:38.69]Wait, this is all damage.
[178:40.27]Shooting star is spelled to the left.
[178:45.77]How high do you need to go?
[178:49.18]You can actually go all the way up to space and it'll be low gravity.
[178:53.26]What?
[178:53.62]And there can still be planets up there.
[178:56.26]Am I going to get attacked by something?
[178:58.21]Yes.
[178:59.19]Yes, okay.
[179:00.61]Harpies.
[179:01.73]That's like it.
[179:04.19]Ooh.
[179:11.56]What is that?
[179:15.32]Star.
[179:16.44]Star.
[179:17.42]Star, I found something.
[179:18.32]Star, I found... What's the Merlin sword?
[179:20.62]Excalibur?
[179:21.18]What's the thing that Merlin is strong enough to pull out of the stone?
[179:23.93]Sword in the stone.
[179:24.47]Excalibur?
[179:25.33]It's right up here.
[179:27.71]Pull it out.
[179:30.37]How?
[179:32.04]With your hand.
[179:40.24]I can't.
[179:41.38]Can I dig it out?
[179:45.33]Do I have to dig it?
[179:47.25]Okay, I got it.
[179:47.63]I got it.
[179:47.91]I got... Arculus?
[179:52.47]Oh no!
[179:57.66]I'm falling.
[179:58.88]Did I use my... No, I'm not.
[180:00.76]Oh, you got it.
[180:08.56]Can I see it?
[180:09.41]I think you might have found the broken weapon.
[180:14.69]If it is what I think it is.
[180:17.47]Is that it?
[180:23.57]Okay, no.
[180:23.95]This is not what I thought it was.
[180:28.31]it's not it's not it makes the thing that I thought it was but it is not that thing so we just need to hold on to that so it is the thing it's it's like the thing it's a it's a part to the thing so what should I do with this uh hold up hold on I'm gonna explain in one second and I just went straight into the sky in love with me
[180:56.53]That was just a random shot.
[180:57.91]I just went right in the air.
[181:01.73]You right click on the green thing, the green cross.
[181:04.89]Yes.
[181:05.85]And you get, that's our super storage that has 160 slots and you can search the name of things.
[181:11.31]Okay.
[181:11.53]And you just put everything in there.
[181:14.12]So take everything from these chests is just going in there.
[181:17.78]Yeah.
[181:18.08]If you don't know what something is, just dump it.
[181:20.84]Just dump them.
[181:22.84]Just dump it.
[181:23.64]Okay.
[181:31.64]Use the fucking sword, holy shit man, poo is streaming out of my- okay.
[181:45.30]Actually most items that we're not already using you can sell.
[181:47.86]There's like a lot of junk like mandible bow and ice blades.
[181:55.64]If you look at an item actually,
[181:59.08]All the weapons that can be crafted into other weapons stay material on them.
[182:02.73]If it doesn't stay material, then just sell it.
[182:05.95]I'm just depositing everything in here.
[182:09.75]Okay.
[182:10.21]You know what?
[182:10.51]That's fine, too.
[182:12.27]So, Arculus.
[182:14.19]Should I use it?
[182:15.88]I'm not, like, melee person, though.
[182:18.82]You shouldn't.
[182:20.18]I shouldn't.
[182:21.48]Should not.
[182:22.08]Don't get self-conscious because your chat tells you to do something.
[182:24.77]Remember when they told me to use doors?
[182:26.85]Remember when they said the problem with those rooms was that there weren't doors?
[182:30.69]We're talking about a literal 100% unanimous everyone is saying yes at the same time.
[182:38.17]You don't... What?
[182:40.70]Why am I not going to use this?
[182:43.02]Nah, just don't even use it.
[182:43.96]Do you see how fast this is?
[182:46.34]Don't use this.
[182:47.94]I think chat...
[182:49.83]Like, if Chat's not okay with the dig the thing to hell, I don't think they can be okay with you using that sword.
[182:56.35]You're a mage, right?
[183:01.47]Yeah, I mean... That's so fast!
[183:09.55]I feel like I will kill things in two seconds.
[183:14.98]Oh, I'm gonna play with my new toy outside.
[183:16.42]This is great.
[183:20.12]Alright, what are we doing?
[183:20.84]Do you want to go exploring?
[183:23.06]Yes.
[183:28.25]Okay.
[183:28.69]You know how fast I'll be able to kill the pig with this?
[183:33.19]I'll show you.
[183:50.60]You don't want me to use this.
[183:52.78]You can do whatever you want.
[183:55.60]I'm gonna use it sometimes.
[184:00.06]This would be my close range weapon.
[184:08.54]Alright, let's go explore.
[184:09.48]Let's go do something.
[184:10.96]I've been kind of... I've been just housebound here for the last, like, 20 minutes.
[184:14.80]We're going to go look for...
[184:19.67]uh life crystals and just chest life crystals and chests should we fall all the way down or stop like stop and then go halfway like you catch up to me actually the crab guy is in this area which is the next boss we would be doing but we would need a way to breathe underwater
[184:51.08]I think we had gil's potions did we well you know oh I went by you oh stop falling actually come back up yeah we'll start here left or right matter just going in left this is a gold portal loot get that's my thing I see up there this thing
[185:20.65]This is a life crystal.
[185:21.95]You mine it, and then you use the life crystal.
[185:24.57]Oh.
[185:26.59]Ooh.
[185:29.01]So they're just randomly around here.
[185:33.72]Yeah, they're just out and about.
[185:36.90]Damn.
[185:37.66]Actually, also with these mods... Actually, no, we need to get the max health first before we do that.
[185:42.58]Oh, never mind.
[185:46.83]I'm just going to go this way.
[185:48.03]There's water over here.
[185:48.81]Is that a bad idea?
[185:50.47]It's a bad idea to spend that much time mining.
[185:52.53]I was just digging down because there's a bunch of open area over here.
[185:55.27]I have a Spelunky potion.
[186:03.26]Don't waste that yet.
[186:06.64]Okay.
[186:10.79]I mean, it depends.
[186:12.47]How long are you going to play Terraria?
[186:19.06]Because they become very useful later on.
[186:20.68]Ow.
[186:23.68]Do you have any bombs?
[186:25.84]I have a lot of bombs, I think.
[186:26.96]Should I just start throwing them?
[186:32.33]No, when I did the mass depositing, I got rid of all of them.
[186:40.31]Ah.
[186:40.45]Let's go the same way.
[186:41.17]Come over here.
[186:47.63]You're underwater, though.
[186:48.29]I have no...
[186:50.92]There's a air pocket.
[186:54.95]Where is there an air pocket?
[186:57.05]Over here.
[186:58.55]Are we gonna drown before... Just jump up here.
[187:06.21]Sorry, I couldn't see it.
[187:07.06]My game was a trillion degrees too dark.
[187:10.28]Trillion degrees.
[187:12.34]Yeah, I'm out of torches.
[187:13.30]I didn't plan ahead.
[187:14.40]Oh, you're almost dead.
[187:16.40]I'm gonna fucking die.
[187:18.94]No, I'm not.
[187:19.32]I'm fine.
[187:22.99]occasionally there's some traps I don't know who set them up don't smooth cold I forget what that actually makes I'm just gonna keep going this way but there's like a little spot to drop down here I'm not gonna drown us or anything right if I drop this down here with you
[187:51.08]No.
[187:52.50]That's definitely not enough water to drown anybody, but it could be.
[187:56.84]Oh, fuck, dude.
[187:58.80]You alright?
[188:00.24]Yeah, I accidentally lava'd myself.
[188:06.70]Don't get lava'd.
[188:08.64]Oh, shit, that's right.
[188:25.59]Jest.
[188:27.11]Actually, we haven't had a Blood Moon yet.
[188:29.15]That holds us back from a lot of stuff.
[188:32.26]Silver bar.
[188:33.10]Jester's arrow.
[188:34.18]Spiked cloud in a bottle.
[188:36.34]Dad.
[188:37.32]Dad, come look at this stuff.
[188:38.22]Go look at that.
[188:39.54]I don't know what it is.
[188:40.14]Cloud in a bottle is basically one of these jumps, like an extra jump.
[188:50.57]So you can do spin and then a third jump.
[188:55.83]Alright.
[188:56.65]Do you want it?
[188:57.48]I just took everything.
[188:59.38]I took the cloud and bottle.
[189:01.91]You'll get more use out of it.
[189:38.83]Frankenstein.
[189:46.69]Where are you going?
[189:51.57]Nothing up here?
[189:57.69]A skeleton dropped something over there, I think.
[190:00.31]To the right.
[190:23.04]I didn't mean it that way.
[190:24.10]You're welcome.
[190:32.50]Or silver.
[190:33.01]What do you got?
[190:35.19]Bomb.
[190:35.61]Okay, I got bombs.
[190:37.07]You want me to start throwing them around?
[190:41.47]Oh, I got a runestone.
[190:51.44]Should I just start dropping bombs?
[190:54.41]Am I muted?
[190:55.11]Like... You didn't say anything.
[190:57.60]Whoops.
[191:00.82]Uh... Sure.
[191:01.76]I was gonna have a long answer.
[191:03.72]I was just sure.
[191:05.28]Well, the reason why you probably shouldn't do that... If you're going down, you should just throw bombs down.
[191:11.82]And then they all fall down in a line, and it's much faster than a pickaxe.
[191:15.24]There's the fall.
[191:18.02]If you're, like, going sideways... I'm just gonna drop them down.
[191:21.96]I have, like, three, so I'm just gonna throw them down there.
[191:25.14]Okay, I hope they land on me.
[191:28.00]How much damage does a bomb do if it lands directly on your head?
[191:32.72]I don't know.
[191:33.06]I'm not dropping bombs on my head too often.
[191:38.35]Like, 80 maybe?
[191:38.83]Okay.
[191:40.57]Oh, fuck!
[191:43.69]OH MY GOD!
[191:44.01]246 for a fall, maybe?
[191:59.88]I thought you were closer.
[192:00.98]I thought you were closer.
[192:03.90]I didn't... I thought there was a platform down where you were.
[192:06.86]I didn't think it was just fall.
[192:08.74]Fuck.
[192:10.92]Uh... You dropped bombs not yourself.
[192:15.50]No!
[192:16.00]Dammit.
[192:17.62]It's okay, I got all your money.
[192:20.42]Did you?
[192:22.12]Yeah.
[192:22.90]Okay, good.
[192:26.73]Oh, don't worry.
[192:27.19]Soon we're gonna be playing hardcore mode on expert.
[192:32.04]I think they're as big as your biceps are.
[192:35.12]They used to be pretty big.
[192:36.18]Alright, so you keep your items though, right?
[192:40.65]Yep.
[192:45.11]Tin ore, bomb, rune, dirt block.
[192:49.35]And we just got such a bunch of just shit.
[193:01.60]Let me put the mirror back.
[193:07.50]You put the mirror back?
[193:09.42]I don't think I've even had it.
[193:12.98]Where is it?
[193:16.04]Sort by stacks.
[193:17.90]Default storing.
[193:19.84]Where is it?
[193:23.21]Filter all?
[193:24.65]Just search mirror.
[193:26.13]Oh, I can just type it.
[193:30.79]So what does this thing do again?
[193:32.91]It's a recall potion.
[193:34.31]And can I recall to you?
[193:36.95]No.
[193:37.55]No.
[193:37.71]It always goes back to your bed.
[193:38.77]Okay.
[193:39.21]Alright, I'm going to use... Where are the bombs?
[193:51.68]I'm going to bring some.
[193:52.26]I'm just going to throw them down near you.
[193:54.32]You actually do have a wormhole potion so you can teleport to me.
[194:01.15]wormhole potion what do they look like you just press m on the map then click on my icon underground do I have to use the potion or just it doesn't consume one it'll auto use the potion when you click on me if you have one yeah I don't think I have one no I don't have one and it's in the box uh I don't think we have any
[194:31.39]Wormhole?
[194:32.01]Oh, no.
[194:32.23]We got one.
[194:32.49]We got one.
[194:32.83]Alright.
[194:35.31]Coming back.
[194:39.91]Okay.
[194:40.71]Okay, this is for you.
[194:43.58]I got another cloud in the bottle.
[194:44.78]So you can equip that.
[194:47.06]So equip this shit, and now I can double jump.
[194:51.46]Again, I have to triple.
[194:52.38]One, two, three.
[194:53.32]One, two, three.
[194:56.80]Very cool.
[194:57.12]Alright.
[194:58.80]Alright.
[195:04.71]Is there something specific besides life crystals we're looking for here?
[195:09.93]Chests.
[195:12.04]And life crystals.
[195:12.84]That's about it.
[195:13.50]Red husk.
[195:14.12]And any kind of gemstone, if we come across it, is also helpful because we don't have hooks yet.
[195:20.16]Where's my bird?
[195:27.42]I don't feel safe without the bird.
[195:33.00]Oh, and we found the mushroom kingdom.
[195:36.80]Which is also helpful.
[195:37.98]Because there's a boss we can summon in here.
[195:42.08]We can?
[195:43.62]I'm like 2 tall.
[195:44.62]We need 25 glowing crystals.
[195:47.74]Or glowing mushrooms, then you can summon a boss in here.
[195:56.94]Chat's talking politics in the chat.
[196:00.31]Stop it!
[196:00.95]Let's get political.
[196:02.79]Stop it!
[196:04.53]What about Hillary's emails?
[196:06.57]Don't... Oh, that's a nice point you have there.
[196:12.11]But what about Hillary's emails?
[196:14.73]Like, right above us is Topaz.
[196:18.44]Topaz?
[196:20.50]Yeah.
[196:22.12]15 of any gemstone gives you a hook.
[196:25.18]And hooks are very good.
[196:40.19]now.
[196:41.75]So where should we go now?
[196:42.91]Down here?
[196:44.83]I'm just placing torches.
[196:45.97]I'm holding shift.
[196:55.17]Don't touch that.
[197:02.02]You're freaking me out.
[197:03.36]I don't like this.
[197:10.01]Doesn't go that far?
[197:10.63]I hate this.
[197:18.13]We don't have the Dryad yet.
[197:22.98]Too scary.
[197:27.02]Can you do it?
[197:28.12]Probably not.
[197:29.36]Mario Maker, can you do it?
[197:30.54]Oh, easy.
[197:31.56]He's a pro.
[197:35.36]I've played Mario Maker a few times, so you're not wrong.
[197:39.63]Should we dig down this way?
[197:41.03]Around here?
[197:41.53]I feel like we're getting too low.
[197:45.22]Too low?
[197:46.16]There's some really good chests that appear at this level.
[197:49.08]There's like a band that makes you immune to lava for seven seconds.
[197:52.28]Should we go this way?
[197:56.10]Uh, how many bombs do you have?
[197:57.62]A lot.
[197:59.50]I'd just start dropping them.
[198:02.07]Okay.
[198:08.16]Much faster than that.
[198:11.08]Not one at a time.
[198:11.84]You're not too worried about what's going to happen.
[198:14.12]Alright.
[198:15.02]Well, watch out.
[198:15.56]Watch out.
[198:34.01]What's that?
[198:35.77]Uh, those combine into life crystals if you get 10 of them.
[198:38.71]Really?
[198:39.38]How do I get rid of the... Can we get rid of the lava?
[198:42.78]Uh, just blow it up.
[198:43.78]Just keep blowing shit up.
[198:50.72]I just blew them up.
[198:52.54]They're still in there.
[199:07.65]So we're keep going down?
[199:12.38]Yeah.
[199:23.08]Keep doing this?
[199:24.84]Keep going.
[199:25.70]I only have like eight bombs left.
[199:32.16]oh my god oh my god what what I'm down there I know but I you told me to keep doing it well okay that's enough more bomb him more
[199:59.28]What about my bombs?
[200:00.32]I don't have any bombs.
[200:01.32]Those are grenades.
[200:07.17]You, like, really don't like working together.
[200:10.91]Wherever I dig isn't good enough for you.
[200:12.59]It's not.
[200:14.39]No, it's not.
[200:36.48]I did it already.
[200:37.54]I think I found something.
[200:39.56]Platinum ore?
[200:43.13]Platinum.
[200:44.63]Good.
[200:44.73]I don't think it's really useful for us anymore.
[200:46.67]Demonite is better and we have a lot.
[200:49.61]Did we skip everything?
[200:52.53]Yep.
[200:59.16]Alright, so I'm above you.
[201:02.60]I'm in hell.
[201:04.78]So we go back up?
[201:10.80]um yeah I have a lot of stuff I could play how do we summon the next boss hold on hold on hold on

[206:29.05]Don't talk about the importance of all of our futures and where it's headed.
[206:33.26]Talk about me instead.
[206:36.08]Alright, so what are we doing?
[206:37.48]What's going on?
[206:47.26]Two.
[206:48.24]One.
[206:49.08]Zero.
[206:49.42]The countdown.
[206:49.90]Come to the right.
[206:50.38]Come to the right.
[206:51.50]Are you summoning a boss?
[206:53.41]There's two bosses we can fight.
[206:55.01]Two bosses?
[206:55.51]Are you going to summon those bosses?
[206:56.65]Two summoning stones?
[206:57.85]Straight above us is a planet with a giant bee in it.
[207:00.25]Got it!
[207:00.55]Okay, so go up.
[207:05.41]Did you take all the ropes that I had?
[207:07.03]I had like a thousand.
[207:08.02]We're going up.
[207:08.52]We're going up.
[207:09.56]Bone rope.
[207:11.86]This is a... You wouldn't appreciate that.
[207:18.44]I just threw a bomb at you.
[207:24.31]I'm helping.
[207:24.87]I'm helping.
[207:25.35]I'm helping.
[207:25.79]I'm helping.
[207:26.23]Okay, so once we dig inside of this... Yeah.
[207:31.97]...the Bee Queen or whatever will spawn.
[207:37.41]Is this a Bee Queen?
[207:39.21]She's similar to the bird we fought where she dashes left and right at you, but also she shoots a lot of things.
[207:44.14]Hey!
[207:44.66]Okay, so...
[207:52.39]Okay, so we're probably going to fight her on the ground.
[207:58.25]So, go down after we summon?
[208:01.61]Yeah, or fight her on the rope.
[208:10.80]Well, I don't... If you want to fight her on the rope, Queen Bee is spawned.
[208:14.36]Alright, so just be careful, right?
[208:15.54]It's just like Contra.
[208:22.36]Uh, she's gonna hurt.
[208:23.34]There's a contra level just like this.
[208:26.08]Alright, well, she's... Whoa!
[208:47.85]Add a mana.
[208:50.27]Add a mana.
[208:54.81]Okay, I guess the best you can do is stand still.
[208:58.09]I'll wait for you.
[208:59.29]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[209:01.97]I got mana back.
[209:07.59]I think you would get a lot of enjoyment from the bee items.
[209:12.15]Ow, fuck.
[209:12.95]Ow, ow, ow.
[209:13.75]Hold on.
[209:16.81]I can potion in four seconds.
[209:18.95]That's a lie.
[209:28.83]I just missed.
[209:30.07]Oh my god!
[209:31.49]I just, I need mana.
[209:32.31]I run out of mana and then I just...
[209:56.08]Stick my fingers in my eyes.
[209:57.50]I gave you a musket.
[209:58.74]Oh, the fucking musket doesn't cost mana.
[210:05.09]Okay, I actually know this is what you want.
[210:07.05]Trust me.
[210:07.67]I think you're going to love this.
[210:09.91]Take this.
[210:11.44]We're going step by step.
[210:12.32]Take this.
[210:14.10]As long as you're shooting wooden arrows, so make sure your ammo on the right isn't flaming arrows or something, you shoot a line of bees.
[210:27.46]Did you pick up my money?
[210:28.40]I did.
[210:39.21]Okay, Jerma?
[210:40.77]I'm not done with you.
[210:41.83]Yes!
[210:42.07]What is it?
[210:42.65]I'm paying attention!
[210:44.28]Take this.
[210:44.90]I'm downloading an entire class into my brain in the first day of school.
[210:49.32]Okay, Jerma, take... You're the teacher, and I'm sitting in a fucking chair, and... Hey, welcome to the first day.
[210:54.51]Here's the syllabus.
[210:55.41]Oh, by the way, here's every single test.
[210:59.09]Do it now.
[211:01.73]It's a lot, Jerma.
[211:02.96]It's a lot.
[211:03.42]I understand.
[211:03.94]I'm asking a lot of you.
[211:05.08]Alright, what do you want me to do with this?
[211:11.85]As long as that's in your inventory, other bees are friendly to you, which is only in the jungle.
[211:15.97]It's up to you if you want to waste inventory space on it.
[211:18.41]I'll keep it.
[211:19.48]Okay.
[211:19.86]And this, you take this.
[211:21.94]If you get hit, bees come out of you.
[211:23.80]Alright.
[211:27.70]Okay.
[211:27.92]And this, when you get hit, it deals damage to everything around you, which will actually hit every segment of a worm.
[211:34.65]It's pretty good early.
[211:35.45]Okay.
[211:37.55]And you take this.
[211:39.99]That'll increase your minion damage.
[211:41.76]Where?
[211:42.06]Okay.
[211:46.86]Equip material.
[211:47.94]Equipable.
[211:49.10]Where is it equipped to?
[211:52.43]Underneath your armor.
[211:53.71]Those slots are all for accessories.
[211:58.07]And I think that's it.
[212:00.72]I would highly recommend use of that bow.
[212:02.44]Yeah, I think I'm going to give it a try.
[212:05.44]Especially because all bees, once they come out, they become homing and they just follow everything.
[212:10.31]And then you just like, you can read your chat and become a boomer.
[212:21.98]So what is the use for...
[212:24.73]for wooden arrows turned into a column of beer because wooden arrows so I don't I don't need like cobweb anymore uh cobweb turns into rope you might as well just turn it all into a rope okay so I need wooden arrows yeah here I have 400. oh okay I'll take 400 arrows you're gonna want more let me check
[212:55.07]They're saying you didn't get the money.
[213:01.18]I have 21 gold.
[213:02.32]Oh, there is gold over there.
[213:12.35]Yeah, you can just have it.
[213:13.73]That's like my, like, fuck-face fee.
[213:16.07]You know what I mean?
[213:16.57]Like, that's yours.
[213:17.87]You can have it.
[213:26.20]Okay, what... Queen Bee.
[213:28.49]As crude as the giant insects are, they can prove useful in certain situations.
[213:33.11]Given the ability to control them, place an inventory to make all small bees weak.
[213:37.23]All small bees and weak hornets friendly.
[213:39.09]I have two of these, though.
[213:40.14]Do I need... Does it make them extra friendly?
[213:42.12]Oh, no, no, you don't need both.
[213:44.24]And again, bees really only exist in the jungle.
[213:46.50]That's probably a waste inventory spot.
[213:48.34]But I thought, you know, maybe you'd get into the whole bee thing.
[213:50.70]What's a strange plant?
[213:53.47]Uh, garbage plant.
[213:58.97]Bee-nade.
[213:59.83]Alright, that's kind of cool.
[214:04.29]Alright, Feather.
[214:10.74]Let's deposit this stuff.
[214:12.24]Avian Cartilage.
[214:13.06]Do you have any more, um, stars?
[214:18.96]I have one.
[214:21.28]You can trade the Strange Plant for Dye.
[214:22.92]That's cool.
[214:26.25]You have one.
[214:26.69]Can I have it?
[214:27.21]Or do you need it?
[214:27.63]Uh, it's daytime.
[214:28.99]I can't give it to you.
[214:31.17]Oh.
[214:32.31]Right.
[214:38.22]I don't think I'm gonna use... Maybe I will.
[214:41.96]No.
[214:42.78]I'll use this.
[214:43.32]I'll try it.
[214:43.66]Try what?
[214:48.81]That bow, if you're not going to use it, I don't want it.
[214:51.43]I'll use the bow, but I'm talking about the vine.
[214:53.81]Should I replace the bow with the vine?
[214:55.67]You know what I mean?
[214:56.77]What's the vine?
[214:57.77]Oh, vile thorn?
[214:58.83]Yeah.
[215:01.33]Nah, keep vile thorn.
[215:02.65]Keep vile thorn and just... When you run out of mana, just shoot bees.
[215:10.09]What do I do with it?
[215:16.49]I guess I'll put it up here.
[215:21.64]I like dark wave, though.
[215:23.50]I like the dot.
[215:26.50]I think magma ore actually makes a good fire spell.
[215:32.68]I think we actually have enough to do it.
[215:38.59]So what's next on the agenda?
[215:41.71]You can hear me, right?
[215:42.73]Yeah.
[215:44.23]Okay, I'm going to make you this stance.
[216:00.81]Never mind.
[216:01.31]I don't know how to make it.
[216:04.05]Let me ask Jeffrey.
[216:06.07]Jeff, how do you do this?
[216:07.39]It might be Hellstone, actually.
[216:11.45]I wonder... Yeah, do I get Hellstone?
[216:13.09]Let me look at this again.
[216:14.31]Okay, 5% increased minion knockback damage.
[216:19.77]This only generates health.
[216:20.91]I want, like, a... I want a bunch of mana regeneration.
[216:23.71]Uh, then we need to find the meteorite.
[216:33.25]Because that gives you an armor set that reduces the cost of spells, mana, and gives extra magic damage.
[216:39.26]Alright, I just send it.
[216:43.22]Fine.
[216:43.80]Alright, well, what's the second boss that you want to do?
[216:47.81]Oh, we have to go back to the corruption.
[216:49.09]There's another boss we can fight there.
[216:50.41]Wanna do it?
[216:54.84]Can I pee first?
[216:55.48]Yeah.
[216:56.62]Yeah.
[216:57.14]Yep, yep, yep.
[216:57.88]It's been like four hours.
[216:59.34]Why don't you go on a pee break too?
[217:01.22]No, I've never peed before.
[217:03.54]Okay, how often do you, like when you stream, how long do you stream usually?
[217:09.16]Five or six hours lately.
[217:10.26]Six hours, like maybe five to eight hours, something like that?
[217:13.36]Yeah.
[217:13.82]How many times do you go pee in like a seven and a half hour stream?
[217:17.10]I don't.
[217:17.58]I don't get up.
[217:18.40]You do not get up?
[217:19.91]I don't.
[217:21.49]I've had like 12 hour streams where I've not peed.
[217:23.33]Are you drinking water?
[217:25.87]Yes.
[217:26.25]Ever since I was a child, it's one of my, you know, one of my pastimes.
[217:29.05]You go to the toilet and you have to make sure you remember to count how long you're peeing.
[217:32.93]I've told you this before.
[217:33.77]I know I have.
[217:34.75]Yeah.
[217:34.87]I've told everyone.
[217:37.15]What's your longest pee?
[217:39.09]My longest pee ever?
[217:41.47]Well, it was probably like, it was probably like 45 seconds and then it stopped.
[217:44.83]And then I thought it was over.
[217:47.63]And then another full, like probably 35 seconds.
[217:51.27]After stoppage.
[217:52.55]Like, stopping.
[217:55.39]For at least five straight seconds.
[217:56.29]Okay, well, if you stop, then it doesn't count.
[217:57.85]No, it does.
[217:58.21]It's the same session.
[217:58.69]It needs to be continuous.
[218:00.64]That's the same session.
[218:01.26]You don't leave the urinal.
[218:04.26]Well, see, because the problem then becomes, if you're allowed to stop, then a whole bunch of people would be stop, start, stop, stop.
[218:10.38]And then you get, like, extended.
[218:11.88]Well, that doesn't happen all the time.
[218:12.72]That's only happened, like, twice.
[218:16.55]The longest pee I've ever had, continuously, where I've just been looking down going, what the fuck is happening?
[218:22.57]Whoa!
[218:23.97]Was... No, you have that reaction, because where does it go?
[218:29.27]If you pee for 60 straight seconds, where is that shit inside of you?
[218:35.33]Your bladder's not that big.
[218:36.43]You're peeing out like a whole body full of pee.
[218:39.65]That's like two 32-ounce Gatorade bottles.
[218:42.35]Like, that can't fit in there.
[218:45.34]You're right.
[218:47.00]I'm laughing because you're right.
[218:50.91]Uh, probably like, I don't know, 50, 60 seconds, maybe?
[218:53.81]Tops?
[218:54.67]You can't go for that long.
[218:57.61]But, uh, alright, whatever, I'll be right back.
[219:00.76]Give me a second.
[219:02.04]Tell me more!
[219:03.98]I'm gonna be muted on my stream, but not on your stream.
[219:07.56]Okay, so when we hear the... Okay.
[219:10.35]BRB.
[219:18.00]well that's just me and you guys I'm okay okay okay I understand I understand okay I understand it's all clear now
[222:35.77]Alright.
[222:36.03]Let's move this out of the way.
[222:39.45]Unmute you.
[222:40.59]Alright, dude.
[222:43.77]Hello?
[222:44.09]Hello?
[222:44.33]Hello?
[222:45.25]Hello?
[222:46.73]Hi.
[222:47.33]Hello?
[222:47.71]Hello?
[222:48.17]Hello?
[222:49.19]Hello?
[222:49.57]Alright.
[222:54.17]So what have you got done in my absence?
[222:56.30]Ooh, you made a little section.
[222:57.38]I made some rooms.
[222:59.70]You made a little another section.
[223:00.86]This is a science section.
[223:04.28]Indeed.
[223:09.49]Alright, you ready?
[223:09.97]Ready to head out?
[223:11.82]I guess, yeah.
[223:12.44]What do you want to do?
[223:13.30]The other boss?
[223:14.66]Other boss.
[223:16.50]Other boss.
[223:24.03]What is this one?
[223:24.71]Is it the jellyfish boss you're talking about?
[223:27.55]No.
[223:28.75]This boss is the hive mind.
[223:30.95]So...
[223:37.55]Is it big?
[223:38.55]Is it cool?
[223:39.09]Is it scary?
[223:41.27]Uh, it's kind of a blob.
[223:42.35]And then you destroy the blob, and then there's a phase two, and then it's a floating blob.
[223:49.36]Introduction of, uh, phases.
[223:51.08]I don't think we've seen that before.
[223:54.76]Someone said you cannot defeat Reddit.
[224:03.73]While I would agree, normally, that yes, you cannot defeat Reddit, what about Hillary's email?
[224:15.50]We had moved on.
[224:17.20]It was already over.
[224:19.00]We had moved on from that.
[224:20.18]Because, alright, you do realize that when you say that, everyone, like, laughs.
[224:26.75]Like, ah!
[224:28.91]Yeah.
[224:31.25]But what about them, though?
[224:34.93]and then it's just and then it just becomes like a politics chat well then then you have to look deep within yourself again and figure out if you're more important than the future of America and then if you should stifle the conversation I guess yes I apologize for restarting it okay
[224:59.93]We're in the corruption.
[225:01.03]We are looking for... You remember there was that thing on the ground before and you're like, what's this?
[225:05.17]And I was like, don't shoot it.
[225:06.39]It's a cyst.
[225:07.53]It grows on the ground.
[225:08.33]We have to find one of those.
[225:11.46]And when we destroy that, it summons the boss and I hope we can beat it.
[225:15.20]That's kind of how it goes.
[225:16.70]So would you say it is some kind of cyst lord?
[225:23.63]I don't get the reference.
[225:25.41]You've never seen...
[225:28.99]a sith lord like like a star oh here's one yes like don't die please I'm but I need any help I'm not I don't think I'm capable of doing this on my own make ropes I don't think I have any you took them all well no no no I'm good I'm fine
[226:05.96]Help me climb this hole.
[226:07.12]I don't want to hear about those emails.
[226:12.38]Alright, are you ready?
[226:14.10]What do you mean, are we going to go up?
[226:16.08]I'll go up.
[226:16.56]When it first spawns, it's like stationary.
[226:18.52]I'm just going to chuck bombs at it.
[226:22.18]Just chuck bombs.
[226:22.80]I have like bee bombs.
[226:29.12]So, are we fighting this in any particular place?
[226:33.28]um just around okay and it's moveset is I honestly don't know it's really it's like the lamest moveset of any boss and doesn't really do anything whoa you came out of here
[227:02.04]As the second phase, I think it does what the brain does in Crimson Area, which is it like teleports around and then comes at you again, but never gets near you.
[227:13.44]And it goes, ahaya.
[227:18.45]I think that's what it's saying.
[227:23.13]Which is, well, you know.
[227:27.73]Do I?
[227:35.52]A lot of damage numbers.
[227:53.97]Okay, so how would you explain this moveset?
[227:59.00]Now that you've seen it, you're like, I don't know what to say.
[228:02.14]What, the moveset?
[228:03.50]Yeah, like you said, what's its moveset?
[228:05.27]And I didn't know what to say.
[228:08.91]Yeah.
[228:11.03]It just kind of exists and moves around in a circle.
[228:14.42]Yeah.
[228:15.36]And then it turns into another thing that moves around in a circle.
[228:19.41]Yep.
[228:20.57]That's the one.
[228:21.07]It gives us a true shadow scale, which you can craft with demonite bars, and I do not remember what it makes.
[228:28.04]Not at all.
[228:28.48]It's a Hivemine.
[228:32.08]So did you get anything interesting?
[228:34.04]I didn't really get.
[228:35.08]I got like this hive mind thing.
[228:36.50]I got true shadow scales for crafting and throwing weapons.
[228:41.73]Place in your inventory for all your projectiles to inflict cursed flames when in the corruption.
[228:49.01]The hive mind.
[228:52.59]Wait.
[228:53.39]All projectiles in the corruption?
[228:54.61]That's pretty cool.
[228:55.60]Yeah.
[228:56.04]As long as you're in this area.
[228:57.08]So like...
[228:58.47]Does that have to be, like, in my hotbar or just in my backpack?
[229:01.51]In your inventory anywhere.
[229:02.85]Okay.
[229:04.23]So, when I shoot somebody with this, they get, like, burnt.
[229:07.01]Oh, that's awesome.
[229:07.61]Yeah.
[229:08.85]That's pretty good.
[229:13.54]Are we good?
[229:14.40]Is this another one?
[229:15.70]Yeah, let's do one more.
[229:18.14]Just in case Shadow Kills do make something good, because I don't remember.
[229:20.79]Okay.
[229:48.12]It's the Tim Allen noise.
[229:49.04]Is it though?
[229:49.71]Kind of is.
[230:17.73]to the beach did he drop what he dropped something uh he dropped a staff for you that's pretty decent did he here let me see that thing shadow drop staff I think that's not what I thought it was actually someone's dark aura rain from the sky
[230:43.48]Let him get the drops.
[230:45.00]I should.
[230:45.36]I should.
[230:46.56]I should.
[230:48.02]So, just... So, just a rain projectile?
[230:51.30]Yeah.
[230:51.60]All of it is gold and steel damage.
[230:54.08]That's actually... That's pretty good.
[230:55.64]I think I'd rather have this than... I don't know.
[231:00.30]There's... There's one of those that you can make with Hellstone, which we can mine down in Hell, except the projectiles go through the ground.
[231:08.20]So... Because, like, if you're underground, that rain doesn't do anything.
[231:12.26]Oh, really?
[231:14.48]Well, it'll come from the top of your screen.
[231:16.84]It's also kind of hard to see.
[231:17.84]I can't really tell, like, exactly where it's going.
[231:21.88]I think it's just because of where you are.
[231:23.56]And the background's purple.
[231:24.80]Alright.
[231:25.47]So we're just porting back, right?
[231:27.63]Yeah.
[231:37.55]I love watching Jerma progress in this game from an insignificant caterpillar to a big, beautiful, slightly more competent caterpillar.
[231:45.56]Okay, I've got the real deal for you.
[231:49.40]Yeah, I guess.
[231:53.54]You got the real deal for me.
[231:54.80]I got a... Uh, did you ever give me that star?
[232:02.46]Nope.
[232:03.38]I have five of them now.
[232:05.38]I can ask you... I thought you can't do that.
[232:09.90]You can do that with the blue ones.
[232:11.44]Oh.
[232:13.21]Alright, I need to change my hotbar a little bit here.
[232:16.01]This is kind of a mess.
[232:20.29]I fooked up.
[232:22.19]You have to craft these at a demon altar.
[232:25.16]I forget that every time.
[232:27.26]So, should I just be putting my gold in here, too?
[232:30.16]In the big box?
[232:35.46]Uh, yeah.
[232:35.86]No reason not to.
[232:36.48]Okay.
[232:41.44]I'm gonna make some more torches.
[232:43.68]And, alright.
[232:45.22]I think it's time to make a change here.
[232:47.71]I gotta go make you an item, so I'll be back.
[232:57.99]This is cool.
[232:58.59]I like this bee thing.
[233:01.41]This can just... It's a one-use, essentially.
[233:04.85]Keep the apples over here.
[233:13.81]Alright, I like that little setup if you press the item in an empty space So you don't have to put it in the hotbar If you believe me like if I just if I click this it'll disease it Thank god he's learning it
[233:43.89]No, click outside of the inventory.
[233:48.35]Oh, I see.
[233:48.77]Okay, I see what you mean.
[233:52.04]So if I click on, let's say, this, I just... No.
[233:56.84]Hello?
[233:58.26]To use items like the mirror, you don't need to put them in your hotbar.
[234:00.88]Instead, you pick them up from your inventory, then left-click outside.
[234:04.47]Oh, cool.
[234:05.99]Cool.
[234:07.95]So, hold on.
[234:08.85]For instance, like a healing potion, I just... Alright.
[234:12.10]I get you.
[234:12.50]I get you.
[234:12.86]I get you.
[234:13.18]I got it.
[234:13.50]I got you.
[234:14.98]Who's this lady?
[234:24.44]I'm gonna make some more rope.
[234:27.83]And some more torches.
[234:30.71]Did you figure out what you could do with the, uh, stuff that we just made up?
[234:34.12]Yeah, I'll be back in a second.
[234:35.32]I'm making the stuff for you.
[234:37.70]Making the stuff for you.
[234:40.48]Thanks.
[234:42.28]You know how sometimes I have trouble.
[234:45.62]You're a real friend.
[234:47.06]Here.
[234:48.40]Uh, take this.
[234:49.24]It's a new summon.
[234:50.02]It's not a bird.
[234:52.66]And this.
[234:54.74]Uh...
[234:56.98]Yes, I'm this tank creeper to fight for you and then yeah, I get the frickin dang creeper So can I have the can I use both these to get like together with the bird and the bank you have one minion slot?
[235:09.01]What's better for a tank?
[235:11.38]Dank is better.
[235:11.98]Their type of summons seeks out enemies a little bit better.
[235:17.31]Their AI is better, even though their damage is not that different.
[235:21.19]So what's Dark Wave or Shadarian stuff?
[235:27.55]Shade Ring.
[235:28.99]Shade Ring.
[235:29.49]Yeah, come use that outside.
[235:30.83]I want to make sure I sort what I think.
[235:33.44]Okay, yeah.
[235:38.68]So you have one minion slot.
[235:42.10]and I think those count as a century slot yeah so you can have two centuries and the clouds count as centuries so they just kind of sit there and they they pour rain so if like there's a boss just you know get those clouds above it and there's a lot of damage because each drop is a projectile so what the hell is it someone's a dank creeper to fight where's my dank creeper you have to go to the top left and unsummon your bird to be able to summon something new oh okay
[236:11.08]And that thing's better.
[236:11.76]They are just a spell.
[236:12.82]Oh, yeah, clouds are a spell.
[236:14.30]Never mind.
[236:14.68]Never mind.
[236:16.46]So I can have two clouds out at the same time.
[236:19.08]Yep.
[236:21.62]I don't like this.
[236:22.24]This thing moves around too much.
[236:23.14]He's annoying.
[236:23.54]Alright.
[236:29.82]I guess I'll just be play stuff and AOE guy.
[236:36.92]And I have the bee thing.
[236:38.06]Okay.
[236:41.32]Alright, I think I'm good to try something new.
[236:44.72]We can fight the Slime God, but I'm not sure if we're ready.
[236:48.69]Don't know if you're ready to fight the Slime God.
[236:53.29]What do I have for potions?
[237:03.02]That's enough.
[237:09.26]You should place down clouds and switch to your other weapons.
[237:11.71]Don't need to unequip your other staff.
[237:15.59]Yeah, that's true.
[237:17.15]That's very true.
[237:19.23]So, essentially, my rotation would be... Like, two... Two, three, four... Yeah, okay.
[237:31.72]And then five.
[237:32.24]Okay.
[237:38.53]this would be a setting up hold on let me see I don't know get the clouds out switch to here throw it out there get it out bang bang bang wait for the overpower to proc get it guaranteed crit switch back inner rage okay bang bang we can prepare to fight the slime god it's kind of hard
[238:06.97]or we can prepare to fight the wall of flesh which will change the whole world into heart which will open up a lot of new things or can hold down this button from massive aoe or we can go look for the meteorite that's how we can get you meteor armor
[238:32.01]then there's also a boss we can summon with meteorite alright what's the what's the the the progression from here you know what's the oh no don't just like make a well and go to the bottom of hell what would you say is okay here's like the next step all of those were very good next steps doing the only thing is the wall of flesh will turn it into hard mode it doesn't stop you from doing the bosses but it's kind of
[238:59.59]If you want to do everything before you change it to hard mode, that would be the last thing you do.
[239:03.83]Okay.
[239:05.41]I would say, because you want to be caster guy, we need to find where the meteorite landed, but I have no idea.
[239:11.48]I think we just have to walk right, and I know how much you hate walking right.
[239:14.30]It's fine.
[239:18.92]Eventually, you can actually create minecart tracks and stuff.
[239:21.80]Do you have torches?
[239:22.54]I only have 31 torches.
[239:24.65]I have seven.
[239:26.51]Probably should make some.
[239:30.69]uh do we have materials in here for this the torch is in here what is it wood uh gel and platforms I don't think we have any gel do we I'm just gonna make a look we do alright I'm just gonna make a bunch oh my god I'm gonna buy Jerma a gift a gift he's gonna love me
[239:58.83]You know how it's like your birthday right now?
[240:00.28]Uh-huh.
[240:04.08]Come here.
[240:06.70]Am I stupid or something?
[240:08.02]Wood platform, sir.
[240:10.63]I'm trying to fucking... I'm right next to you.
[240:13.15]Happy birthday.
[240:16.85]Equip that.
[240:18.56]And then press R.
[240:29.01]How long can I stay like this for?
[240:30.99]Forever.
[240:31.81]What?
[240:36.01]Yes!
[240:37.93]Okay.
[240:42.40]Thank you for giving me my fursona.
[240:45.68]No problem.
[240:47.14]It's your fursona.
[240:48.40]Yes, it is.
[240:49.72]Alright.
[240:50.08]Wood and platinum.
[240:50.76]Not wood.
[240:52.12]Wood.
[240:52.42]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[240:53.22]Okay, okay, okay.
[240:53.86]I see what you mean.
[240:54.36]Okay.
[241:11.38]Alright, deposit that, and then we can go.
[241:20.53]Alright!
[241:21.43]I'm ready!
[241:24.11]Where'd you go?
[241:24.45]I'm coming.
[241:25.09]You went up?
[241:25.53]I went to space.
[241:26.68]Why'd you go to space?
[241:28.92]I was waiting.
[241:31.40]Oh, I need my mirror too.
[241:41.61]Sometimes you just go to space.
[241:42.93]Alright.
[241:45.31]So.
[241:47.53]What's happening?
[241:50.38]Are we ready for this?
[241:52.60]What did I say we were doing?
[241:54.18]We were going really far right.
[241:55.66]You said go really far right to find the meteor.
[241:58.32]Okay, while we're there.
[242:04.97]Actually, no, we can't do that.
[242:05.99]I'm sorry.
[242:07.03]We'll figure it out.
[242:08.09]You know, it's a journey together.
[242:09.79]Yes, it is.
[242:15.23]Can you eventually get a fast traveler car or something to go here fast?
[242:27.11]I was going to say you can set up minecart tracks.
[242:29.47]There's also like redstone like there's in Minecraft.
[242:32.23]You can set up a teleporter.
[242:34.79]There's also boots that make you sprint, but we have not found any of them.
[242:38.44]And the cobbler has not arrived because he's an asshole.
[242:43.47]Is it going to be nighttime?
[242:44.25]Is it a bad thing or a good thing?
[242:46.24]It doesn't matter.
[242:47.34]Doesn't matter.
[242:48.86]Also, eventually you get, yeah, there's mounts and there are wings that are pretty fast.
[242:59.23]Cool.
[243:05.17]So, I know when you make a new Minecraft seed, it's, oh, 30 times the size of Earth.
[243:12.62]How many times the size of Earth is Terraria?
[243:18.64]I'm going to say 600 times.
[243:20.28]I'm going to say, actually, we should abandon Earth and just live in Terraria.
[243:32.04]Upload our brains in here.
[243:37.83]Somebody's calling us a Dean Dengus.
[243:41.15]They're saying, build more rooms, you Dean Denguses.
[243:44.83]Yeah, now they're right.
[243:45.69]But building rooms is the most boring part.
[243:49.76]Here's the trick.
[243:50.64]Here, I want to show you.
[243:52.00]I can't do moves.
[243:52.98]How do I get out of this?
[243:54.32]Okay, trick.
[243:58.12]So this room pre-exists.
[244:01.58]Okay.
[244:02.16]Where is there a... I need a chair.
[244:05.67]What you do is you take someone stupid like the painter that you never want to talk to, and then you force him to live way out here.
[244:11.79]Why?
[244:14.97]So that the rooms in your base free up.
[244:19.67]But I don't have a chair to place in here.
[244:21.37]You bring this painter all the way over here.
[244:26.86]Do you have an axe?
[244:28.72]I do.
[244:29.98]Can you chop down these trees?
[244:32.97]Yeah.
[244:33.19]I think I can handle it.
[244:39.55]What do you need these chopped down for?
[244:40.69]You need the wood?
[244:42.09]Yeah, so I can make a chair and force the painter to live in exile.
[244:46.10]Normally I build them, like, on the planets.
[244:51.82]Pet snow owl?
[244:52.70]I don't want it.
[244:58.21]Painter is a god NPC.
[244:59.59]You're really making a lot of people very sad right now.
[245:10.45]Summoner.
[245:11.05]Weapon proficiency level up.
[245:22.17]So what are you doing?
[245:24.69]I'm finishing this house.
[245:27.52]Apparently it didn't have a table.
[245:35.50]These things are pretty good.
[245:42.32]There's the rumor.
[245:45.76]So, equipable.
[245:47.20]Where do I equip it, though?
[245:49.30]Oh.
[245:51.08]It's in the corruption.
[245:51.78]It doesn't count as a house.
[245:55.17]Never mind.
[245:55.89]Is it just right there?
[245:57.11]What does he do?
[245:58.51]Just stare at me?
[246:01.47]Oh yeah, that's just a pet.
[246:02.91]Most pets don't do anything.
[246:07.56]I have a bee following me.
[246:10.08]Oh, I was wondering what the bee was.
[246:15.76]There's some good pets that provide light and stuff, but most of them do not.
[246:23.38]So we're just walking to the right until we find the meteor.
[246:29.61]Yeah.
[246:30.71]There's no other goal.
[246:31.55]We just walk right until we see it.
[246:34.69]Yep.
[246:35.05]Because on our map, we explored left and I didn't see a meteorite on the map.
[246:38.95]The map always updates automatically.
[246:42.44]So it should be this way.
[246:47.28]Then there's going to be some sick, sick ass meteor heads.
[246:53.79]So when we get to the meteor, does the boss just spawn after we touch it or something?
[246:58.01]No, the meteor is, uh, you just, it's a resource.
[247:01.88]Just so you get meteorites from it.
[247:04.28]What is this?
[247:04.94]Light slime?
[247:05.56]Uh, kill that.
[247:09.16]Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it.
[247:10.86]I am, I am.
[247:11.52]I'm killing it.
[247:12.30]We need the blighted gel from it.
[247:19.11]Fucking dark.
[247:20.79]Oh, God.
[247:21.55]Oh, God, dude.
[247:23.62]I dropped 22 gold in that hole.
[247:25.96]I get it.
[247:30.00]We still haven't made hooks.
[247:33.16]How far down is that hole?
[247:37.30]I'm going to rope down there.
[247:45.83]It's not that far.
[247:46.51]Should I just jump?
[247:49.53]You can see where you're... I believe in you.
[248:00.34]Do I have any rope?
[248:08.52]Are you even in the right hole?
[248:09.66]No, you're not.
[248:10.20]Other hole.
[248:10.58]What do you mean, other hole?
[248:13.09]Is it another hole?
[248:14.05]I don't know if it shows for you.
[248:15.57]Oh, no, I see it.
[248:16.23]I see it.
[248:16.47]Okay.
[248:23.03]So, are you trying to stay down here, or what do you know?
[248:25.91]What are you up to?
[248:26.53]I'm coming back up.
[248:27.28]I'm just making sure I get the gel from that thing.
[248:43.06]Rotten chunk.
[248:51.50]I'm afraid to just walk forward now because of that.
[249:00.77]I've got the grab arm.
[249:01.73]I'm just gonna hold my torch out.
[249:09.45]That's bright.
[249:10.33]Oh, we still have to do this, actually.
[249:13.65]I forgot about this guy.
[249:16.40]Huh?
[249:19.32]Hurry.
[249:20.88]We need to build platforms.
[249:24.54]Hurry.
[249:26.14]We're gonna fight somebody.
[249:27.45]And he's a pain in the ass.
[249:32.87]Fight pain in the ass guy.
[249:34.79]Yeah, you have to, uh, you talk to the old man in front of this, which is the dungeon.
[249:39.39]You can only enter the dungeon after you free him of his curse, and his curse is that a giant forearm skeleton lives inside of his body, and you gotta fight it.
[249:47.86]It's a pretty wicked curse.
[249:49.84]That is a pretty big curse.
[249:52.60]Yeah.
[250:01.40]This is a big platform you're making.
[250:08.09]Yeah, he's a piece of shit.
[250:14.86]In fact, I worry about us.
[250:16.86]Do you?
[250:18.50]Yeah, I do.
[250:19.40]You ready?
[250:20.44]I guess.
[250:21.28]Eat your food.
[250:21.88]Pre-food.
[250:22.59]Okay.
[250:27.61]I've pre-fooded.
[250:34.72]Oh, he doesn't have forearms.
[250:35.75]Is that only the mechanical guy?
[250:41.37]I guess we all have a curse.
[250:42.49]I guess you guys are right.
[250:47.15]Oh, he's a chump.
[250:48.30]Freaking normal mode.
[250:50.30]Ah, bees!
[250:54.12]Is there a certain place we should be aiming?
[251:03.19]In his head.
[251:09.01]Chomp.
[251:09.25]I thought you said he was really hard.
[251:15.44]He can be, but I don't usually play on baby mode.
[251:21.76]Let's throw the drop.
[251:22.40]Sorry.
[251:22.58]It doesn't drop anything.
[251:23.34]Sorry, I'm the anchor.
[251:24.52]No, it's fine.
[251:26.90]Like, really normal mode eventually when we get into the... Still hard.
[251:31.62]Okay.
[251:33.74]So now we can go in the dungeon?
[251:36.94]Uh, yeah.
[251:37.28]I want to keep looking for the meteor, though.
[251:38.94]Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[251:42.41]Though the dungeon has a couple of things we could really use.
[251:53.07]We are very far away from our home.
[251:56.96]Here, I got two.
[251:58.12]Ooh, mana crystal.
[252:02.50]Yeah, I gave you two.
[252:04.02]Zombie banner?
[252:06.63]Uh, it auto gives that to you when, like, 50 of something dies.
[252:09.81]And if you hang out at home, you deal, like, two times damage to that enemy.
[252:13.90]Oh, that's cool.
[252:15.72]Cool.
[252:21.28]This is a neat little game, isn't it?
[252:24.18]So, there's no meteor.
[252:29.75]And?
[252:29.93]Is there a follow-up to that?
[252:32.75]No?
[252:33.19]I guess I was wrong.
[252:36.85]Let's go in the dungeon.
[252:41.30]Into the dungeon it is.
[252:49.88]Ow.
[252:50.18]What?
[252:50.45]These crocodile things.
[252:52.87]Jeez.
[252:53.63]Who the fuck is... Who's Tyler?
[252:55.09]Tyler.
[252:56.59]Oh, he's fishing.
[252:59.17]No.
[253:00.27]Don't die.
[253:00.73]Don't die, dude.
[253:03.60]You're gonna die.
[253:05.30]You're gonna die!
[253:06.12]No, I'm trying to avoid being hit!
[253:08.74]No, that's- oh, that's my stupid- I thought that owl was coming to get me.
[253:19.42]Thank you.
[253:21.88]Dude, I was on a healing streak.
[253:41.62]Somebody said the meteor is probably on the sky.
[253:43.14]That's pretty likely.
[253:45.96]Sky meteor, I guess.
[253:48.26]In this particular seed.
[253:50.32]I don't think I've ever seen that.
[253:56.07]I thought that just died.
[253:57.19]Thank god, I'm so stupid.
[253:59.95]How'd you even get up there?
[254:03.81]How did you get up there?
[254:05.69]On a rope?
[254:06.95]Oh, because I have a lot of jumps.
[254:12.23]You could probably turn into a frog and do it.
[254:14.49]Would that be better?
[254:16.25]Oh.
[254:16.75]Do I jump higher?
[254:18.71]The first jump you do is higher, yeah.
[254:20.32]Well, you didn't tell me that!
[254:23.08]I thought it was just a cosmetic thing.
[254:29.08]Nice!
[254:30.42]Isn't that a lie, though?
[254:31.44]Because you can see Plantera's bulbs when they become available.
[254:36.00]If you've already been in that spot.
[254:42.18]It's very dark up here.
[254:44.78]Woo!
[254:45.50]Where are you going?
[254:48.80]I'm going to the dungeon.
[254:51.50]Oh.
[254:54.66]I was just hoping there would be something up there.
[255:03.23]Okay.
[255:04.81]Into the dungeons.
[255:06.27]This is the dungeon.
[255:08.09]This is the... Oh, yeah.
[255:09.87]Okay, so what you need to find and make sure...
[255:12.17]Huh?
[255:13.09]...is, uh, uh, golden keys.
[255:17.57]Golden keys.
[255:17.89]There's gonna be a bunch of golden chests down here that you need keys to open that drop from the enemies.
[255:23.48]Okay, so look for golden keys.
[255:25.62]And inside a golden chest, the number one thing we're looking out for... Yeah?
[255:32.34]...is a, uh, a shadow key.
[255:35.18]Shadow key.
[255:36.14]So we need, we need a key to get a new key, is what, that's, that's the goal.
[255:40.29]That's, like, best case.
[255:41.37]Otherwise, there's just, like, decent stuff in these chests.
[255:43.77]Understood.
[255:48.63]So how far down does this go?
[255:50.87]Uh, it's pretty big.
[255:55.03]It's, uh, pretty... pretty... pretty big.
[256:07.47]oh and we got the uh the mechanic who is my Terraria waifu just in case you were wondering what do you got wire cutter she's the person that lets you set up like the wires to set up teleporters and stuff ah what's this do there's like a switch here like I can't press it
[256:36.13]Waiting for you.
[256:36.69]What's the switch do?
[256:41.31]It turns on the lights.
[256:42.81]Oh, so why didn't I turn it on?
[256:47.60]It turns on like one small lantern.
[256:49.64]You probably just didn't notice.
[256:56.36]Chest.
[257:00.14]This is a key.
[257:01.32]It's one of those golden keys.
[257:02.48]Yep.
[257:08.24]The Ultra Stream Sting.
[257:10.34]I'm a streamer.
[257:17.48]There are spikes on the walls and floors that hurt.
[257:20.88]They are hurt.
[257:21.66]There's also traps down here, so like dark traps that'll shoot things out at you if you step on the pressure plates.
[257:27.33]Great.
[257:30.11]Really looking forward to that.
[257:32.87]And those things that go along the ground?
[257:34.43]Mm-hmm.
[257:38.76]What the heck is that?
[257:40.16]He just like summoned a bunch of spots.
[257:45.69]So there's the key that we don't have.
[257:48.91]What just hit me?
[257:50.93]Uh, dark trap.
[257:52.35]They're hard to see.
[257:59.57]Rain dawn.
[258:00.15]Dude, aggro them up here and they'll get hit by my rain clouds.
[258:05.81]All comboed.
[258:16.06]You don't stand on spikes.
[258:17.19]Spikes are bad.
[258:17.87]Wand core?
[258:22.07]Oh, they craft some really shitty wands that are really complicated to make.
[258:25.08]And then there's like one decent one.
[258:30.75]If I remember correctly...
[258:46.40]um what do I do uh you see I'm attached to the ceiling with a I thought the painting was like a platform this game is too dark oh alright we're uh
[259:17.05]How did you make that hook that you're attached to the ceiling with?
[259:20.43]Um... You can check the box.
[259:24.08]You need 15 of a gem.
[259:26.56]So if we have, like, 15 amethysts or something, I don't think we have enough.
[259:36.55]No.
[259:38.53]Well, we're coming back.
[259:40.07]I think I didn't have that much money, I don't think.
[259:42.27]But there was some gold down there.
[259:43.79]I would go get it.
[259:46.53]Put this stuff away.
[259:53.16]We're full.
[259:55.52]We're full?
[259:56.16]Our box is full.
[260:00.10]We can take some shit out.
[260:10.08]Arcane dust.
[260:21.59]Make a night owl potion?
[260:24.54]Really?
[260:24.84]Is that gonna help me?
[260:27.10]Not rea- oh yeah, maybe.
[260:28.54]We need- there's a potion vendor too and he would sell them for cheap.
[260:33.60]Where was it?
[260:36.91]He has not joined us yet.
[260:39.53]Can I craft that or did I- here it is.
[260:41.55]Increases night vision.
[260:44.29]Uh, give me that please.
[260:50.50]What the fuck is going on right now in the house?
[260:53.21]If I die in the house, I'm gonna... What is going... He's still alive!
[261:07.75]Ayayay!
[261:10.68]Who let the door... You let the doors open.
[261:14.44]You let in a draft.
[261:17.00]Wait, you've been at home for how long now and you're gonna start blaming me all of a sudden?
[261:21.21]Alright, so, um, do we have any more of those wormhole potions, or am I, uh, screwed here?
[261:26.79]Uh, I have four on me.
[261:28.19]Does that help you?
[261:31.27]Can I buy them, or can I make them?
[261:32.57]What do they take and make?
[261:34.24]I don't think you can.
[261:36.64]Well, I mean, you can, I just have no idea how.
[261:39.16]Ooh, does somebody sell them?
[261:42.22]Anybody know?
[261:45.14]I need Blink Root.
[261:46.86]So, it looks like I have to just come fall down to you.
[261:54.79]Uh, you can do something else.
[261:56.21]What do you want me to do?
[261:57.57]I don't know.
[261:59.95]Yeah, we have no more room here.
[262:00.93]What do you want to do?
[262:01.75]Uh, let me, let, is there, like, there's, like, mushrooms in here.
[262:06.38]I'm gonna get, like, the bacon, the mushrooms.
[262:09.12]Don't get rid of those fucking mushrooms.
[262:10.78]Why?
[262:11.04]I need them.
[262:12.90]You actually need these mushrooms.
[262:14.86]Oh, no, no, glowing mushrooms I need.
[262:18.04]Um, there's, like, random little materials that I just, what the hell are they doing in here?
[262:22.67]Yeah.
[262:25.35]Don't delete anything.
[262:26.83]I'll come home.
[262:28.59]I feel like you're going to delete the secret recipe.
[262:32.99]I'm probably going to delete the secret recipe.
[262:37.86]I can just leave.
[262:38.62]You know, I can just leave.
[262:40.84]I can just leave.
[262:45.08]Jerma, Jerma, distraction, baby toys.
[262:47.52]Oh, look, a new staff.
[262:49.20]Look, a new staff.
[262:50.82]Oh, that's two new staffs.
[262:53.46]Hey, Jerma, do you see this thing over here?
[262:54.94]It's not as cool if I didn't earn it.
[262:58.07]Jerma.
[262:59.79]A floating book.
[263:02.03]Yeah, I guess it's... I guess it's cool.
[263:05.71]When you come over here and you right-click the floating book, you can have an additional summon for 10 minutes.
[263:13.34]I guess that's cool.
[263:15.36]It's really cool, Dad.
[263:17.46]Thanks.
[263:18.86]It's just too bad you didn't earn it.
[263:24.68]This game is dark!
[263:27.22]Okay.
[263:28.90]So you said you were gonna... Oh, this thing is... What's going on with this thing, guys?
[263:36.76]Hold on.
[263:40.51]I gotta try... Where are you?
[263:44.25]Oh.
[263:45.01]I thought you jumped in a hole.
[263:46.49]Ooh.
[263:46.83]Ooh, sparklers.
[263:47.29]29 magic damage?
[263:56.89]That's pretty good.
[263:58.35]So this next one is High Tide.
[264:02.11]Sends out a droplet of water that will create small tidal waves.
[264:06.64]Ooh.
[264:07.54]That's cool.
[264:09.28]Takes a lot of, uh, mana.
[264:13.56]Oh, there's too many items for me to... I don't know what I want to do with any of these.
[264:16.89]Um.
[264:19.37]Ugh.
[264:25.49]This is a lot of damage in its close range.
[264:31.66]I don't know.
[264:37.30]I think I'm gonna get rid of Dark Wave.
[264:43.86]That's not close range.
[264:49.66]Oh, alright.
[264:50.68]Alright, this is awesome.
[264:52.05]I thought it was... Okay.
[264:55.17]Alright.
[264:57.63]That's really, really good, actually.
[264:58.69]Cool.
[264:59.63]Yeah, I'm gonna sell Dark Wave.
[265:04.23]Dark Wave is out.
[265:08.47]And I think... High Tide isn't doing it for me.
[265:13.75]I like, um... I like... I like the... Yeah.
[265:16.75]Yeah.
[265:18.19]I appreciate you giving this to me, but not for me.
[265:22.81]Yeah.
[265:24.15]You gotta get eyes on.
[265:25.05]So I'm gonna store it.
[265:32.08]Have you done any consolidation here?
[265:34.84]Yeah, I've got a lot of stuff out.
[265:36.20]I like that, I like that.
[265:42.24]Now I need some rope or materials or...
[265:51.83]What do I want to... Let me put the gold in here.
[265:56.41]Weapons are used to make better weapons later.
[265:57.91]Just a never-ending tree.
[266:09.88]Let's take that back.
[266:18.30]Okay, um...
[266:22.01]potions um give me this I want to use that I cannot believe we haven't had a blood moon yet what happens I cannot believe it what's a blood moon uh it's just at night a blood moon status and a whole bunch of enemies attack you and they drop some things and then after the first blood moon there's an npc that'll join you
[266:52.10]How do I just take them?
[266:52.74]There we go.
[266:56.36]No, no, no.
[266:56.86]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[266:58.57]I just want... I just want one of these.
[267:03.03]Okay, I got it.
[267:06.66]Alright.
[267:08.94]I'm ready to attempt that again.
[267:12.29]I got food.
[267:12.89]I have torches.
[267:14.53]I need some rope, though.
[267:17.07]You can start walking there, and I'll teleport to you.
[267:19.81]Rope, rope, rope, rope.
[267:21.41]What's the quickest way to make a rope with the spider webs?
[267:24.77]A cobweb, yeah.
[267:27.36]I can make you some if you don't have it.
[267:32.12]I don't have very much, no.
[267:34.84]There you go.
[267:37.18]That's a lot.
[267:39.16]Okay.
[267:39.64]I'm gonna touch this thing.
[267:40.47]You better not run out.
[267:42.05]Okay, I'm going.
[267:44.77]See... See you later.
[267:47.91]See you there.
[268:01.34]Is there... Can we put, like, a checkpoint flag somewhere over here?
[268:07.60]What?
[268:08.30]No.
[268:08.76]We can't put like a checkpoint flag.
[268:10.18]We have to go all the way over here again.
[268:12.60]Mm-hmm.
[268:13.56]Unless you want to build a wine cart that goes all the way there.
[268:16.80]You could just make a bed there.
[268:22.20]Yeah, but then you won't have this bed.
[268:24.54]That's true.
[268:27.48]You can make a sleeping bag.
[268:30.44]Or a tent.
[268:33.26]Sounds interesting.
[268:38.36]I don't even know what the hell that was, but... I got hurt from it.
[268:48.49]I gotta build houses, man.
[268:50.35]Like, I don't wanna... But I gotta.
[268:53.17]Are zombies in raincoats?
[268:58.90]Yeah.
[269:00.46]That's... That's very cute.
[269:02.26]Okay.
[269:05.18]I'm just gonna that's just like what else you want me to say oh that's your spot along I mean it's raining
[269:24.61]is fishing this game yeah didn't you say that you didn't really dabble into fishing at all I have never dabbled you have how many what do you have like six seven eight hundred hours in this game uh about 200. really even after all the other times you played this I mean I had I okay I have 160.
[269:57.19]I played like 60 hours and there wasn't that much to do.
[270:01.98]Um, way back when the game first came out, that skeleton that we just beat was like the final boss.
[270:07.70]Are you serious?
[270:08.92]I think when Terraria was first released, there was nothing after that.
[270:11.65]Wow.
[270:14.01]That's so, that's so early.
[270:17.85]Yeah.
[270:19.33]And now he's like, yeah, there's, there's a lot of shit.
[270:24.66]He's a small fry.
[270:28.54]Well, the game's been up for so long.
[270:30.75]Oh, cool.
[270:39.59]Oh, man, I didn't have enough.
[270:40.71]Do I have three?
[270:42.43]No, one more.
[270:48.35]Big snowball head.
[270:56.39]I don't think I'm going to be changing weapons for a very long time.
[270:59.95]This thing is unbelievable.
[271:01.83]Does a bunch of damage.
[271:03.67]It's got a nice spread on it.
[271:06.89]Nice spread.
[271:07.77]Doesn't use that much mana.
[271:12.10]For the first time in my life, I feel like I truly... No, I can't do that.
[271:17.12]Yeah, and it lights my way.
[271:27.54]I don't even need torches anymore.
[271:28.86]I can just go like this.
[271:29.74]I need torches.
[271:34.71]I have 76.
[271:39.07]You should definitely make some, though, because I'm a very unreliable person.
[271:43.51]Don't rely on me for that.
[271:45.27]Because you know what's going to happen.
[271:49.52]I need torches.
[271:50.00]You're going to be very disappointed.
[271:52.04]I... I need torches.
[272:04.88]Where is it?
[272:05.54]Am I up there?
[272:06.77]Where is this place?
[272:12.45]Where the hell is this place?
[272:15.47]I'm not even there yet.
[272:17.73]Yeah, you're not there yet.
[272:20.85]I thought you were the guy.
[272:22.54]No, I'm not.
[272:23.26]I have a mini-map open.
[272:26.16]I don't think I've ever bought anything from Knicks before.
[272:35.13]Okay, I have 1800 torches I'm ready to go Alright.
[272:38.95]Well I'm like almost there I'm at where we fought the skeleton guy What flavor jawbreaker do you want when I go to the jawbreaker store?
[272:49.46]Um, uh plain chocolate just plain
[273:04.17]Alright, I've made it.
[273:05.15]You can teleport to me whenever you want, whenever you feel like it.
[273:07.53]Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[273:11.25]One second.
[273:14.66]It's so concrete.
[273:17.72]Plain.
[273:20.14]The one that is just the white one that has all the other ones inside of it.
[273:25.01]Did you know that fish isn't good for you?
[273:29.71]Um...
[273:33.04]It's true.
[273:33.72]I can't even give that a response.
[273:36.18]It's actually true.
[273:37.96]The new reports?
[273:39.66]Yeah.
[273:41.30]I think it's like Dr. Sinewiser was saying that you're a dummy, fish are from the ocean, and you're not.
[273:48.94]Stop eating them.
[273:49.56]Alright, well... I forgot to buy musket balls for Mercury.
[273:57.11]Not every fish is full of Mercury.
[274:05.47]All that Mercury and, like, cod.
[274:09.73]That's no joke.
[274:11.55]All that... It's not... Yeah, and guess what?
[274:17.24]When you cook meat on a grill, it releases a shitload of carcinogenics.
[274:24.90]All that stuff that you like to eat, all, like, those crispy edges and the little... Ooh, charcoal crispy!
[274:29.68]That's awful.
[274:31.02]Awful for you.
[274:31.62]But we do it all.
[274:32.28]Everybody does it.
[274:33.82]I don't do it.
[274:35.61]You've never had a grilled piece of meat?
[274:37.17]What am I fucking bumping my head on?
[274:39.22]I'm getting too angry at this game.
[274:40.44]I gotta slow down.
[274:51.58]Who actually has grilled pieces of meat?
[274:55.29]What?
[274:57.89]Like your grandfather, maybe.
[275:00.43]What is coming over here?
[275:01.85]What's this plan?
[275:02.77]You can't destroy that.
[275:03.71]It's a trap.
[275:04.73]Oh.
[275:06.52]Alright, this is kind of... So, is there a boss at the bottom of this?
[275:13.54]No.
[275:15.70]Uh, later there is a boss here.
[275:17.29]Much, much, much, much later.
[275:20.35]For now, it's just kind of a pet.
[275:22.87]And bones.
[275:24.31]Cool.
[275:28.45]All the money down there, but it's too scared to go over there.
[275:37.92]Oh my god.
[275:38.42]What are you doing?
[275:40.44]Dying.
[275:42.90]You... Are you okay?
[275:44.16]Yeah, I'll be fine.
[275:46.66]All food is bad, just eat air.
[275:50.07]Actually, water is bad for you.
[275:52.27]It's true.
[275:52.57]Dungeon heist.
[276:07.29]Blue Candles is spawning more enemies.
[276:08.97]Kill the Blue Candles.
[276:10.55]Don't kill the Blue Candles.
[276:13.17]But somebody on the internet told me to do that.
[276:15.89]But that somebody doesn't know that we really would like more enemies, that they have a higher chance of... That's where I died before.
[276:23.80]I ain't gonna make the same mistake twice.
[276:30.58]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[276:41.37]Alright, so is it not safe to go down there?
[276:43.83]Did you get my stuff down there, by the way, on the bottom here?
[276:46.15]I did, I did, I did.
[276:47.81]I know, I just, I know.
[276:49.39]I need to make sure.
[276:50.34]You think you know.
[276:51.12]You always talk about how you know.
[276:52.80]And I hope my wife gets me dinner.
[277:01.64]Slot machine?
[277:04.38]Slot machine?
[277:05.06]What did you say?
[277:05.88]That thing you just pulled.
[277:07.26]It looked like a slot machine.
[277:08.30]I didn't know what it was.
[277:13.31]No, that is not what I've said.
[277:17.05]Slot machine, as in like a question, is that a slot machine next to you?
[277:20.87]I don't, I didn't see it.
[277:29.16]You pulled a lever and it made the whole room dark.
[277:31.20]Are you getting any keys?
[277:34.86]I don't think so.
[277:35.95]I have two.
[277:36.37]I have one.
[277:43.43]I have one key.
[277:46.17]Do you want to bring these pianos back?
[277:47.87]Do you want to make a dungeon room?
[277:51.79]No.
[277:53.57]You don't just want to chill out and make, like, candy rooms and dungeon rooms?
[277:56.83]No, the candy room would be fine, but... Everything else is... Well, that was horrible.
[278:02.99]That hurt.
[278:09.17]Hey!
[278:09.99]Holy shit, man.
[278:13.85]Sitting up here.
[278:16.57]Alright.
[278:18.99]How are we doing down there?
[278:25.88]Alright.
[278:28.22]I'm going to open this one.
[278:30.32]I already opened it.
[278:35.61]You did.
[278:36.59]Mystic magic missile.
[278:39.55]Mystic magic missile.
[278:40.55]Here you go.
[278:45.78]Would you just drop it?
[278:47.41]Yeah.
[278:50.65]You're going to get to use some magic method.
[278:56.23]Did I pick it up?
[278:57.69]Yeah.
[279:02.51]I'll look at it later.
[279:06.47]look at it now look at it now I can't we're being fired at from all directions I'm not just gonna stop and let me look at my items it's a new item chat what does it do that's what okay that's all the guys can we get some uh I don't have this mystic magic missile there's a rod oh 31 damage alright I'll give it a try I'm gonna see give it a try
[279:36.51]Do you want to know why a magic missile is so good?
[279:43.44]What does it do?
[279:46.82]Nope.
[279:48.92]I guess it... Magic missile.
[279:52.64]Very fast.
[279:53.38]Very strong.
[279:54.20]Nine mana.
[279:55.91]It's just like a fast, good item.
[279:58.07]It just goes like bang, bang, bang.
[279:59.59]Bang, bang, bang.
[280:01.39]It's like a little solo target.
[280:02.87]I like it.
[280:03.75]I don't love it, though.
[280:06.23]Yeah, I think if you hold you can aim it.
[280:11.89]But also your other thing does feel a lot better.
[280:14.48]Yeah, the other one's more mana efficient.
[280:16.02]Is that what you guys think?
[280:20.98]Has anyone seen a meteorite?
[280:27.85]Hold the button.
[280:33.05]Oh, you can... Hold on.
[280:35.23]Can I just, like, have that sit on somebody?
[280:40.89]Can I sit that on somebody?
[280:43.19]And it... No.
[280:47.44]Okay, I didn't know if I could hold it continuously on them.
[280:55.04]What's going on?
[280:57.37]You got any keys?
[280:58.29]I do.
[280:59.03]We need to stick together.
[281:03.09]I'm looking for chests.
[281:05.19]You're just fighting the same old thing, looking at your dumb item.
[281:09.25]How come I don't get items?
[281:10.47]You should check on how that item works, Jeremy.
[281:13.67]And I said, okay.
[281:14.51]I'll give it a try.
[281:16.69]I was joking.
[281:17.42]How much further are we going to go?
[281:20.68]This is a deep dungeon, isn't it?
[281:36.79]Is there a gold in the chest anyway?
[281:40.25]Right here.
[281:41.63]This isn't a locked one though.
[281:43.83]Unlocked.
[281:45.63]It had a gold key in it.
[281:47.58]Cool.
[281:49.60]Careful of the skeletons.
[281:50.82]Do they explode?
[281:51.38]They look like they explode.
[281:52.50]Nope.
[281:56.56]Oh, kill this guy!
[281:57.18]Can I have that sword you don't use?
[282:02.52]Uh, it's in the box.
[282:04.68]Ah, you fucker.
[282:06.16]Why would I just carry that around with me if I'm not going to use it?
[282:08.24]I thought you were using it.
[282:10.34]I mean, I have too many items.
[282:14.14]I have too many cool things to use.
[282:15.96]I can't carry it around.
[282:19.00]You're the melee guy.
[282:20.20]You're the one that should have had it.
[282:22.26]Why am I holding it?
[282:23.36]I didn't want to be a melee guy.
[282:25.21]I haven't any items I like.
[282:29.15]Oh, you didn't want to be a melee guy.
[282:35.85]I want to play my tuba how do I get what's going on why am I stuck in this chest uh oh happened to me too what yeah that's uh that's a bad program
[282:55.10]Do I... Can I, like, put something in it?
[282:58.86]I can't teleport?
[283:00.02]Yeah.
[283:00.51]It's just broken.
[283:02.45]I think we're fucked.
[283:03.79]No.
[283:04.03]Game over.
[283:04.91]Wait, hold on.
[283:06.05]Why'd you open it too?
[283:07.61]Because I wanted to see what you... No, why'd you open it?
[283:11.31]I just wanted to see if there was really a problem.
[283:14.62]I said, I'm stuck.
[283:15.84]What's wrong?
[283:16.50]And then... Are we sure there's nothing that can happen here?
[283:23.36]Uh, you can leave and rejoin.
[283:25.68]Well, what would that, where's that gonna put me?
[283:28.34]Uh, back at your bed.
[283:30.26]What?
[283:32.55]Yeah.
[283:33.57]Wait, okay, what if you stay here?
[283:34.75]Then the server will go down.
[283:35.97]Okay, what if you stay, I come back and then teleport to you?
[283:39.19]Do you have a wormhole potion?
[283:42.49]Um... I have them, but I can't give them to you because we're both lost.
[283:51.42]I'm gonna have to leave too.
[283:52.82]No, can I- I think I- can I make- I think there might be a wormhole potion in the chest.
[283:57.83]Alright, hold on.
[283:59.43]I- I'll be back.
[284:00.03]I mean, I'm- I'm going to have to leave as well.
[284:02.83]Because I'm stuck.
[284:03.77]But you own the place.
[284:05.53]I own the place.
[284:08.53]Fuck!
[284:09.65]No!
[284:11.20]Yeah, I saved an exit and got a big error.
[284:13.12]Oh well.
[284:16.62]We have been live... I've been live for seven hours.
[284:19.97]Almost eight, actually.
[284:22.17]So are we going to keep going?
[284:27.11]You want to just... Let's get to the bottom of that dungeon.
[284:34.74]Okay.
[284:35.36]Will that be like significant more time?
[284:39.66]No, not really.
[284:40.18]Alright, let's do that.
[284:41.94]Don't open any chests.
[284:45.66]Any chest that isn't a gold chest, you can't open anyway, so don't touch them.
[284:50.60]Okay.
[284:59.61]Alright, so are you going back in?
[285:03.79]Yeah, one second.
[285:13.22]You let me know?
[285:18.08]You let me know when you're in there.
[285:21.00]I'm in there.
[285:22.18]Okay.
[285:24.36]I'm going to join off of you.
[285:29.18]Use that character.
[285:38.10]Joining in game.
[285:39.92]Here we go.
[285:41.43]Yeah, there are some people here that like do not deserve to live in this house.
[285:47.20]Who are all these people?
[285:49.68]Wait, hold on.
[285:52.42]Who the fuck are all these people?
[285:56.06]When did this become a hotel?
[285:59.48]Like this is not even all of them.
[286:03.28]Hey, Paul.
[286:10.15]That's why you talk shit about the painter.
[286:12.23]Like, if you really need some painting done, you can go seek him out.
[286:16.16]Alright, so listen.
[286:17.52]So what happens?
[286:19.74]So these are just NPCs that they just wander around.
[286:22.30]If you don't lock them in a cage in your house, where do they go?
[286:26.26]They all just scatter around where their home is.
[286:30.27]So the strategy is to keep them into little cubicles like it's an office.
[286:35.24]yeah and there's different departments otherwise they wander around and if you want to talk to one they could be like next to someone and you like can't talk to them because they're under the other guy but okay if okay let's just say for instance if I threw a bomb in this room right now uh please I'm just theoretically is it is that bad
[287:04.39]yes okay I didn't know if they can be hurt or friendly fire they can be hurt and more importantly you destroy the room and you know who's a yes I'm aware who's going to rebuild it alright let's let's go are you already on your way there hold on I'm like in the sky and I found three planets three planets I'm just gonna like make people live up here really fast
[287:34.34]let me I didn't bring like a workbench or wood mining potion flip yeah we don't have any um any wormhole potions anyways I gotta join your team uh do you want that what sword the cool one yeah alright I have that is there anything else that I should take out of here that we I mean actually want to have with us
[288:04.48]No.
[288:06.92]Rope.
[288:07.78]I think I deposited it accidentally.
[288:17.02]Rope.
[288:18.03]Alright, the fisherman's gonna live in the Sky Pyramid, cause fuck that guy.
[288:22.21]Spelunker.
[288:24.03]Night Owl Potion, okay.
[288:28.95]Alright.
[288:31.17]I think it's- we got some daylight here, let's go.
[288:42.52]Time to start going.
[288:43.42]Time to go.
[288:47.98]That's enough for one day.
[288:50.06]We will come back another time.
[288:52.68]Time to go.
[288:53.40]Are you following me?
[288:56.30]I'll be there.
[288:56.74]Alright, I'm going.
[289:06.75]Yeah, and I'm gonna make you a grapply hook.
[289:12.55]You're gonna make me a grappling hook.
[289:14.80]What a swell guy.
[289:17.14]What color would you like?
[289:18.72]How do I skip forward to when you guys are in the dungeon?
[289:21.18]There's only one way.
[289:24.88]I'm really sorry.
[289:25.78]There's only one way that's possible.
[289:28.12]You have to exit the stream.
[289:31.44]Go take a bath.
[289:34.89]And take a nice long bath.
[289:36.23]And by the time you get back, the stream might not be live.
[289:40.31]So then you can load this back up, get to this point exactly, and then skip like 30-40 minutes ahead.
[289:48.14]That's really... That's the only way.
[289:50.62]If there was any other way, maybe I could help you out here.
[289:52.74]There's not.
[289:56.41]I'm sorry.
[289:56.79]I wish there was.
[290:06.47]Four days in a row.
[290:07.13]This has been the fourth stream in a row.
[290:08.33]Four days in a row.
[290:08.83]I haven't done four days in a row in, like, at least a couple months.
[290:12.75]I don't usually do four days in a row.
[290:14.23]Congratulations.
[290:15.05]Hey, thank you!
[290:16.27]Wow.
[290:17.83]I'm gonna have something.
[290:21.73]Throw bombs at the house before the stream's over.
[290:23.81]No, I'm not gonna, like, ruin his game.
[290:27.61]This is your game.
[290:30.09]You're the host.
[290:31.03]Isn't this your, like, file?
[290:32.61]Dude, I have so many worlds that I wouldn't care.
[290:37.24]No, no, no, no, no.
[290:39.02]I might want to, like, play again.
[290:41.77]I don't want to just ruin the entire game.
[290:43.53]Yeah, just like you wanted to play EDF again.
[290:46.15]We did play EDF, like, seven or eight times.
[290:48.15]Yeah, and you said we would definitely play again.
[290:50.67]Yes, and then what happened was you were going to sleep.
[290:54.75]Why?
[290:55.07]You were going to sleep at, like, 10 p.m.
[290:58.42]your time, which is 6, what, 8 p.m., 7 p.m.
[291:02.46]my time.
[291:05.67]You were on this schedule where you were waking up at like 6 o'clock in the morning.
[291:10.79]True or false statement?
[291:12.85]Were you on a schedule where you were waking up at like 5 or 6 a.m.
[291:15.77]during that time you were playing EDM?
[291:18.58]Oh, me and Etalyx did.
[291:19.92]Me and Etalyx did.
[291:21.35]Yes.
[291:22.59]Oh, yeah.
[291:23.31]Yes, we did.
[291:23.95]Me and Etalyx played that game, like, at least four or five more times without you there.
[291:27.75]Sorry.
[291:29.39]Oh, my God.
[291:30.67]You were waking up at, like, five and going to bed at, like, seven.
[291:33.77]I don't believe you.
[291:34.63]Also, you put the most useless shit in this fucking box.
[291:41.77]We're going to need these 40 acorns.
[291:50.83]I told you that I didn't know what I needed to do because if okay let's say I trashed those acorns I don't know there's like a rain hat I don't know what if there's probably like a scenario where you'd be like hey dude uh whatever the acorns acorns I threw them away what dude we need to plant uh I don't know I just put everything I don't know what I need to do
[292:21.82]Are ice blocks worth mining?
[292:24.42]No.
[292:25.30]Oh, okay.
[292:26.90]And don't put them in the chest.
[292:29.08]I like got rid of the mushrooms from here before.
[292:31.85]And now there's more mushrooms.
[292:36.65]I had some extras.
[292:54.94]The axe in here?
[292:56.88]The starting hammer?
[292:57.98]This guy is wild.
[293:03.74]I don't know.
[293:09.67]You can't just put me on a bike with no training wheels and I don't know how to ride the bike and then you go, alright son, come on up here to the top of the biggest hill in the town.
[293:22.24]Uh, Dad, I don't, I, should I, am I ready for this?
[293:24.86]Yeah!
[293:27.18]And then just let me go with no training wheels, going straight down like 70 miles per hour.
[293:31.30]You were ready.
[293:36.28]I was not ready.
[293:38.80]There's an immediate cut after you let go, and I, I'm flying down screaming, going like 75 miles per hour, of me in a hospital bed.
[293:48.41]Uh...
[293:51.54]In like a full body cast.
[293:57.20]It's one of those, one of those like comedy scenarios where I'm in like the full body cast and I'm like trying to drink soup and it's like, ah, I can't drink the soup.
[294:05.87]He opens the chest and clicks deposit all.
[294:09.11]Oh man.
[294:10.33]What?
[294:12.41]They're riding on you.
[294:15.75]How would they, who knows?
[294:16.78]How would they, oh yeah, we're in a squad.
[294:21.07]This is literally a SpongeBob episode that happens to Squidward.
[294:24.55]So that's what I'm saying.
[294:27.22]Alright, teleport to me so we can... Wait, does that actually happen?
[294:38.42]Does anybody have a clip of Squidward eating the soup?
[294:41.36]No, that does happen.
[294:42.74]That does happen.
[294:58.57]I forgot to buy musket balls again.
[295:00.01]And whose fault is that?
[295:02.54]He deposits everything in the chest.
[295:04.08]You forgot every time.
[295:09.26]So let's try this one more time.
[295:10.50]What do you think?
[295:12.88]RPG.
[295:13.20]RPG.
[295:14.38]Wait, hold on.
[295:14.76]Just stay there.
[295:15.80]You just help progress.
[295:17.07]I need to watch this.
[295:19.45]This is a video I need to watch.
[295:22.26]Am I gonna, like, die?
[295:23.54]I have to watch this.
[295:28.76]Just, like, protect me for just one second while I watch this.
[295:31.57]I'm protecting you with all of my heart.
[295:50.26]You're so protected right now.
[296:09.17]That's not it.
[296:09.79]He doesn't get to sue.
[296:17.26]That's close enough.
[296:18.62]Alright, thank you.
[296:30.15]Alright, let's speedrun this.
[296:33.69]Okay.
[296:35.41]But I mean like a Jeremy speedrun, not a Star speedrun.
[296:39.41]Okay, so like a normal person's pace.
[296:41.71]Oh!
[296:46.61]What?
[296:46.85]Did you hear what he said?
[296:49.87]What's that horn that everybody uses?
[296:51.43]That funny meme horn?
[296:52.79]The one that goes, defeated.
[296:59.03]What'd I do?
[297:00.99]Not down there.
[297:08.94]I am hungry, dude.
[297:11.97]Come on, dude.
[297:15.77]Come on, dude.
[297:17.59]Hey, you... Let's just be really, really clear about this.
[297:21.62]You invited me to play this.
[297:23.80]You were like, hey, play Terraria with me.
[297:25.50]I'm like, okay.
[297:27.14]And now you're like, I don't want to do this anymore.
[297:30.65]Well, now I've streamed for eight hours and I've streamed for more than four days in a row.
[297:39.13]Have you, really?
[297:41.79]Yeah.
[297:43.11]Wasn't there, like, a string of star streams?
[297:45.47]Or are you only streaming, like, once a week?
[297:47.88]Are you back to, like, star streams every day now?
[297:51.58]I don't know.
[297:52.20]I feel like I've streamed for two weeks.
[297:54.36]But that's definitely not true.
[297:55.52]That's the right clip?
[298:00.04]I'll watch it after we beat Dungeons.
[298:08.25]I think it's been like 10,000 days actually.
[298:10.32]Did you throw your schedule away too?
[298:14.80]My stream schedule?
[298:15.84]Yeah.
[298:16.88]I haven't had one in a very long time.
[298:19.30]Yeah.
[298:20.32]I like it better.
[298:25.80]I have like an estimation of what I think I'm going to do when I think I'm going to stream, but no one really knows.
[298:34.50]I don't even tell people that.
[298:36.64]So what, you just, like, turn it... You don't have, like, a way for people to know when you might stream?
[298:41.11]Because that's how I do it here.
[298:43.49]It's like, oh, I might stream.
[298:47.11]Like, no, that's not true.
[298:48.27]Like, I have, like, a day or two in advance.
[298:50.37]Usually a couple days in a row.
[298:54.34]I have, like, I don't know, command.
[298:55.64]I have to ask my chat, do you guys know when I'm going to stream?
[298:57.86]I have to probably know.
[299:04.66]Oh, you don't have your summons.
[299:06.88]Oh, well.
[299:10.20]Did I deposit my... I think I deposited my... Oh, here you go.
[299:14.27]Take this.
[299:16.61]Jerma was torn in half by what?
[299:24.67]Oh, I forgot to give you the hook.
[299:26.84]Yeah, the hook.
[299:28.24]Take that.
[299:29.02]Equip it, and I think it's default the button is E. E. Okay, yeah.
[299:35.80]So, like, if you jump, don't, like, attach to the spikes.
[299:39.20]But if you jump and attach to the ceiling, it resets your jump.
[299:43.08]That's, uh, really great.
[299:45.21]Wish I had one of these.
[299:47.37]You do.
[299:47.65]I just gave it to you.
[299:50.75]And you said thank you.
[299:59.72]Yeah, I know.
[300:03.02]Watch out!
[300:03.48]Oh my god!
[300:04.24]Oh, furry, furry, furry!
[300:05.02]Okay, I'm gonna give this to you now.
[300:10.66]Because I made this mistake with Ashley.
[300:13.40]I'm giving you... Wormhole Potion.
[300:16.92]W-what potion?
[300:18.16]Wormhole Potion.
[300:18.86]Not when you die.
[300:20.69]Thanks.
[300:22.01]And I, thanks for reminding me, am gonna take the Night Owl Potion.
[300:26.69]Did that do anything?
[300:29.53]It really doesn't do much.
[300:35.95]Why would you make one of these?
[300:44.52]Are you bored?
[300:44.92]If you drink more than one or two of these, does it work better?
[300:46.76]I don't think so.
[301:00.36]I love this weapon.
[301:00.94]Yeah, because it sounds like you when you talk.
[301:11.90]Alright, I can- I know.
[301:13.48]I know we're getting to that point where you're like done screaming.
[301:17.64]Because- Because every other comment is like, you're stupid.
[301:24.28]Yeah, I hate your voice.
[301:26.16]You're ugly.
[301:29.06]Ow!
[301:31.27]Oh my god!
[301:33.13]Did you give me the potions?
[301:35.38]I did.
[301:36.74]Also, fun fact, you can pickaxe those spikes.
[301:40.34]I don't think you gave me the potion.
[301:47.18]I 100% threw them at you.
[301:48.73]Thank god you are 100% accurate.
[301:51.67]Okay, go get my gold.
[301:56.75]I can tell you're done because of how bossy you're being right now.
[302:00.56]Wow, that's a huge map.
[302:04.71]That's actually a medium map.
[302:10.42]I have returned.
[302:15.28]I'm just like full of references.
[302:29.01]Your summons, dear.
[302:30.85]I know.
[302:32.69]Look, I just got back.
[302:34.77]Did you forget to touch the bewitching table, dear?
[302:37.04]I did not.
[302:37.80]There are two.
[302:41.72]Are you sure?
[302:42.26]Alright, why are you destroying this?
[302:48.23]Because your gold was over there.
[302:49.67]I didn't want to walk across spikes like you did.
[302:54.56]You got hit by... You got hit twice, too.
[302:56.74]Alright?
[302:57.02]I didn't know.
[302:58.06]Yeah, because you had more HP than I did.
[303:04.51]What is...
[303:29.55]Very cool.
[303:29.89]Are you going to try and open this box?
[303:31.31]I'm not going to touch that box.
[303:32.31]Alright, we've made it to the point where we last were killed.
[303:36.87]No, we weren't.
[303:37.53]We didn't.
[303:37.93]Oh, fuck.
[303:38.33]No, we didn't.
[303:38.87]You're right.
[303:39.43]We went down.
[303:40.53]You're absolutely right.
[303:42.03]I've actually never been wrong on my stream before.
[303:47.38]I don't know if you know that.
[303:54.28]We said, LOL, how are they still in the dungeon?
[303:56.80]Ben, that person knows backseat gaming.
[304:04.73]Okay.
[304:05.29]Okay.
[304:24.92]When was the last time that you were backseat gamed?
[304:27.72]For real.
[304:28.41]Not just like, oh, not real.
[304:31.93]Ashley showed me a funny picture the other day.
[304:34.25]Maybe it was this morning.
[304:36.29]Where someone had police surrounding their house and they actually threw tear gas in their room.
[304:42.31]What?
[304:42.47]And the screenshot of the chat was them all backseating what they should be doing.
[304:46.99]Like, get milk.
[304:47.69]It'll make your eyes stop burning from the gas.
[304:49.58]Like, oh, do this.
[304:50.34]Like, every single comment was backseating.
[304:54.87]The person's running around their house not even looking at the computer.
[304:57.34]So to answer your question, when was the last time I was backseated?
[305:04.28]Every day, all day.
[305:06.74]What else is there?
[305:08.32]What's the other option?
[305:09.48]I kind of need to respond to how absolutely fucked up what you just said is.
[305:13.65]Yeah.
[305:14.59]No, it's pretty fucked.
[305:16.13]That's fucking horrible.
[305:18.55]But every day you're backseated?
[305:25.71]But, like, no, I'm not talking about, like, you should have pressed your alt in Overwatch, like, faster.
[305:30.98]Like, somebody was really, like, trying to teach you how to play a game.
[305:33.44]Because you already know how to play Overwatch.
[305:36.58]A game that you, like, maybe didn't know.
[305:38.60]What, like, every day?
[305:41.59]I mean, doesn't that make it worse?
[305:43.29]You're saying you already know how to play Overwatch.
[305:47.95]But that's not backseat gaming.
[305:49.57]That's just, like, somebody being, like, mean about how bad you played.
[305:58.24]they one in the same not really is it if they think I did something wrong but I didn't like like today when people were telling me that those the houses weren't working because I wasn't making doors is that back seating and then it was today it must it was today then every day there there was today's
[306:24.65]One of.
[306:25.33]See, you just... You don't read your chat enough.
[306:27.76]It's going too fast.
[306:29.00]I read my chat all the time.
[306:31.14]I read my chat all the time.
[306:33.20]But if you're in Jerma's chat, why would you type out something he should do?
[306:37.44]You know it's a waste of your time.
[306:41.72]By the time, like, he reads, like, two words, like, 16 Jupiters would have gone by.
[306:47.12]Uh...
[306:56.81]I pay very much... One would say the reason why I have so much trouble sometimes in games is because I am engaging with the chat more than... I saw you playing against the pig yesterday, where instead of playing the game, you were reading the chat, talking about how a baseball player would never do that.
[307:15.40]Yes.
[307:16.46]I was there, you know what?
[307:17.78]You were... I didn't know you were there.
[307:19.14]I would have said, what's up, man?
[307:20.20]I was there.
[307:20.96]There you are.
[307:23.45]Every time you've seen me in real life, you've actually spit on me.
[307:26.19]Like, first interaction.
[307:29.39]No, wait.
[307:30.53]You're misunderstanding that.
[307:32.29]I do chewing tobacco.
[307:35.40]It's just you might... Every time you walk up to me, I just might spit.
[307:40.24]It's not that I'm spitting at you or anything.
[307:44.02]Have you show up at a bad time?
[307:47.02]What was that stat?
[307:49.02]Uh, you picked it up.
[307:51.22]treacherous sphere.
[307:54.58]Someone's a treacherous sphere.
[307:55.80]Oh, what the fuck?
[307:57.54]What?
[307:58.96]There's 57 melee damage on this.
[308:01.92]Really?
[308:02.10]That's... Good.
[308:03.82]In my small scape of this game, would I have knowledge of the last few hours?
[308:08.27]I mean, like, at this point, the highest I'm seeing are, like, 30s.
[308:10.53]But also, it's one of the awkward weapons I don't want to use.
[308:16.15]What, if it does that much damage, I don't give a shit?
[308:20.17]Remember that deleted Jerma or Star video where they met in real life and Jerma punched him in the face?
[308:24.71]And we, like, we've gotten over that as well.
[308:29.90]That's why the video was deleted.
[308:30.92]Because we've, like, kind of gotten over that.
[308:35.04]There's a lot of enemies over here.
[308:37.04]I mean, like, too many for me to handle.
[308:39.10]That sphere is amazing.
[308:40.72]Should I give it a try?
[308:50.64]Whoa!
[308:51.46]It shoots the things that I shoot!
[308:54.88]Wait, what did you get?
[308:58.06]I got double, like, shooting stars now.
[309:01.32]Oh, is that your... Does that count?
[309:02.74]Hey, chat, does that count as a sentry?
[309:06.53]That's pretty nuts.
[309:08.93]That's amazing.
[309:13.49]Yeah, there's some equipment later where you'll be able to have, like, four of those out.
[309:17.91]I gotta put this in a... This is, like, kind of... It's broken.
[309:20.57]I don't know what it's doing.
[309:21.87]It's doing this to the wall.
[309:29.76]Wow.
[309:30.48]You win the internet.
[309:31.46]Oh, I hate that.
[309:38.06]Oh, God.
[309:38.70]That's, like, the worst thing.
[309:40.34]That's the worst thing ever.
[309:41.62]I've got one, too.
[309:43.95]Oh man, you win the internet.
[309:45.79]Oh.
[309:45.91]Wait, you have one too?
[309:53.26]Yeah.
[309:55.88]This is fun.
[309:57.08]See, I told you you should have stayed for an extra, like, ten minutes.
[310:00.88]Yeah, otherwise we wouldn't have gotten the uber gear from the uber dungeon.
[310:13.57]Are we farming for anything in particular or are we just kind of standing around?
[310:17.67]Golden keys so that we open one of these chests and get a shadow key.
[310:23.30]Interesting.
[310:24.44]This is what I want.
[310:33.60]You only need one shadow key to open every shadow chest after that and there's a whole bunch of them on the far left side of the map.
[310:41.00]There's so much shit down here.
[310:46.50]There's a key right there.
[310:47.52]Where?
[310:51.81]I got one.
[310:52.11]Is this chest not open?
[310:55.11]The chest is locked.
[310:56.77]I feel it looks different.
[310:59.49]That one was already open.
[311:00.35]This one's open already.
[311:02.01]Midnight oil?
[311:04.57]Silver bar, magic missile.
[311:05.89]I already have one of these.
[311:07.66]I don't know who's going to take it.
[311:09.02]Maybe we don't take the other magic missile?
[311:12.76]My inventory is so full.
[311:14.68]Mine's pretty full too.
[311:17.80]I bet Jerma has Reddit open right now.
[311:20.36]No, I don't.
[311:20.76]Turn on screen capture right now.
[311:23.84]No.
[311:26.12]Alright, let's keep going.
[311:47.71]That thing is so good.
[311:51.01]Can you cast it real quick?
[311:59.16]I think we can only have one between us, which doesn't make any sense.
[312:02.64]That's odd.
[312:03.22]Nothing else does that.
[312:06.84]That seems like a patch.
[312:09.62]Like this has been patched.
[312:16.71]How much further down are we going?
[312:18.17]This is really far down.
[312:30.03]Check for that thing!
[312:30.63]Ancient Necro-Hellman.
[312:34.47]I didn't know there was a Necro set down here.
[312:37.79]Update my Facebook page.
[312:39.27]I have not logged into that Jerma985 Facebook in probably five years.
[312:47.89]I don't use Facebook.
[312:49.17]Did you just throw that sword away?
[312:51.97]No.
[312:59.82]If you follow jermaOn Facebook, the cool thing about it is that you get to be one of the Germs.
[313:07.07]No, my favorite part is when I join Star's congregation of smashing gents.
[313:12.37]My favorite part is when I clearly make the mistake of naming my group that, and then you name yours something even worse after me.
[313:22.22]What was yours?
[313:23.40]The Inhumane Psychopath.
[313:28.42]Fun fact, fun fact, yes, fun fact.
[313:30.89]Years later, I determined how fucking terrible and awful of a name that is.
[313:36.77]That I tried to delete it, but you can't delete groups.
[313:41.56]Valve, remember we talked about how Valve has like 2019 paint with a 2005 engine?
[313:47.35]You cannot delete a group.
[313:49.81]If you make a Steam group, do it right now and have 100 people join, all of them have to leave before you delete it.
[313:55.32]It can't be deleted.
[314:04.30]That's why I support the epic Steam store.
[314:06.60]The epic Steam store.
[314:08.36]Oh, Steam.
[314:09.18]Steam is... Steam is... Steam is so epic.
[314:12.60]Alright, I don't want to die down here.
[314:19.26]Steam.
[314:22.03]Uh, did you open that chest?
[314:24.17]This one over here is not open.
[314:25.87]I don't have anything.
[314:26.49]Is anything in here?
[314:27.25]I couldn't even see what it is.
[314:28.07]I'm being attacked.
[314:31.14]Some stupid staff.
[314:32.48]It's a shitty staff.
[314:35.52]But anyways, yes, I realized yours was Congregation of Smashing Gents.
[314:41.19]And I was like, oh, I'll have mine be the Inhumane Psychopath.
[314:48.67]I can't remember why it was... Someone started it and it was not me.
[314:53.34]I think it might've been Shibby of just like having really stupid group names.
[314:58.90]It's like Chivvy's Club of Awesome, I believe is what it is.
[315:02.66]If that is correct.
[315:03.48]I might be wrong, but it might be.
[315:05.98]I think it is.
[315:06.72]I think it was someone else.
[315:12.59]No one has a group name, though.
[315:13.97]I can tell you that.
[315:14.65]I'm sorry, but I think I was against the grain there with my group name.
[315:22.82]The inhumane psychopaths?
[315:24.32]You're very proud of that?
[315:25.48]No, I'm just saying it wasn't like the smashing gents or the cool group or the cool group of dudes.
[315:34.71]Good job.
[315:36.57]Good job.
[315:37.39]So I made another group because I was like, I don't like that group.
[315:40.91]That group, I don't like that name.
[315:42.09]And I want to like make, I'm going to actually do stuff with this group.
[315:44.69]And I changed it to even worse.
[315:46.45]What do you think I changed it to?
[315:49.98]I don't remember I went so generic just safe name Jerma's group yes really I don't know I I was I don't know I I went from one extreme to the other
[316:15.58]I don't think that Steam group has a name.
[316:18.52]I think it's just Jerma's group.
[316:25.47]Can we even cut through this place?
[316:28.71]I don't think our pickaxes can do that yet.
[316:31.59]Oh, no, I can.
[316:32.63]And then I... I haven't used that group, and I can't remove it.
[316:37.15]People are like, hey, dude, your Steam group is all fucked up, and there's a bunch of dumb shit in it, and there's all kinds of crazy discussions that have to be removed.
[316:44.43]I wish I could.
[316:48.75]Steam does not allow me to delete these groups.
[316:52.13]And like having a Steam group that can be posted on just means there's going to be like a whole bunch of people speaking Russian and saying like weird shit all the time.
[317:00.73]Or just like virus links.
[317:02.72]Yeah, virus links and like... And then I was like, oh, I have moderators.
[317:09.12]This is a long time ago, by the way.
[317:10.58]This is at least five years ago, four or five years ago.
[317:12.48]Maybe you should have moderators for that.
[317:15.68]And then it would just be impossible to keep up with it.
[317:22.74]Can we not break through these?
[317:24.74]I guess we can.
[317:25.84]We can.
[317:30.10]Where was the bottom of it?
[317:34.35]I'm digging down.
[317:39.39]Let's go to hell.
[317:40.91]But let's earn it this time.
[317:42.09]Earn it.
[317:52.42]Uh-oh.
[317:53.10]Yeah, don't let him in here.
[317:57.06]Keep digging.
[317:57.94]Hold on.
[317:58.26]I need to protect us.
[318:04.55]No shadow keys.
[318:05.47]Never found one.
[318:20.46]We have to earn our hell, is what they're saying.
[318:23.46]Earn your hell!
[318:26.64]What is that?
[318:28.49]Why is it- is it helping us mine?
[318:29.79]No.
[318:36.87]Oh god.
[318:40.65]You see that thing below us?
[318:41.89]Yeah, what about it?
[318:43.15]If we kill it, the wall of flesh will summon.
[318:45.19]Let's do it.
[318:46.61]No preparation wall of flesh right now.
[318:48.09]Dude, why did you just drop that?
[318:49.99]What are you doing?
[318:51.59]Why did you do that?
[318:53.48]You just like... Because we had triple jumps.
[318:56.82]You just like dropped me out and I had like no health.
[319:00.76]You better stay alive so I can teleport to you with the worm.
[319:02.88]I don't know.
[319:09.47]Where did the voodoo doll go?
[319:18.40]Also, this is not regular Hellstone.
[319:20.90]Oh my god, warn me.
[319:23.31]Oh my god, dude.
[319:24.55]Oh, it's because I have a danger sense potion.
[319:39.97]oh no are there any more of those in the inventory I don't I don't think so how do I make one how do you make them I don't I don't think so oh I got it uh I think this is where we call it no how do you make one I don't know and we definitely don't have it because we've been deleting everything
[320:07.18]And look, I'm not even there anymore.
[320:08.90]No!
[320:09.62]No, I wanted to see it.
[320:11.30]Oh!
[320:12.67]I didn't summon it.
[320:16.45]Oh, all that, we earned it.
[320:18.95]We earned it.
[320:20.11]I guess I... I don't know why my brain just thought me teleporting over there was going to teleport me to a safe place and not just like where you are.
[320:26.99]I didn't think of it either, but it was like the moment I was... Yeah.
[320:36.67]What about the cheat hole?
[320:40.55]Cheat hole, let's go.
[320:41.09]Oh, shit, you can get spirit droplets right now.
[320:43.81]Cheat hole.
[320:58.30]Uh-oh.
[320:59.12]Don't tell Jerma that you can craft the armor now.
[321:04.27]It gives you two minions, and the bonus is probably like a third.
[321:09.01]Shouldn't have told me.
[321:19.01]Alright, so where should we be stopping?
[321:25.17]Just right here?
[321:26.25]Where we were last time?
[321:29.37]Um... Wait, what do you mean?
[321:31.23]Down the cheat hole.
[321:35.14]I think we should stop.
[321:39.58]You see, because we are very close to you getting... Okay, number one, it's a 38 damage ghost summon.
[321:45.32]And then you can summon a whole ghost necromancer max minion set.
[321:51.73]There's a whole... We could all go and do that.
[321:54.49]But if we do it now, then you're not going to play next week.
[321:56.81]And we can make Saturday Terraria Day.
[322:00.05]You want to keep Saturday Terraria Night?
[322:02.17]Terraria Day?
[322:03.59]Terraria Day.
[322:04.61]Okay.
[322:06.98]I'm into it.
[322:12.06]Ow.
[322:15.78]Bill, my wife is saying wall in all caps.
[322:19.24]No.
[322:19.76]No.
[322:20.30]No.
[322:21.03]Wall?
[322:22.63]What do you mean wall?
[322:23.17]Ignore her.
[322:24.01]Ignore her.
[322:26.45]DOS Fridays, Terraria Saturdays.
[322:29.35]That's going to have to change.
[322:30.61]What is going on over here?
[322:32.83]This leaf shield thing.
[322:34.29]What is this?
[322:36.59]uh when enemies are near she does that oh and it's like hell for jen yeah I I will play Terraria again definitely interesting enough to do it again you haven't even gotten a hard mode yet kid I know kid but yeah um
[323:04.77]I think that's it, right?
[323:06.27]Yeah, now it's just the only thing left to do is talk political.
[323:08.91]Well, the only thing left to do is... How long has it been?
[323:12.39]Yeah, five and a half hours.
[323:13.47]Five to six hours, that's good.
[323:16.78]This is a bonus stream for me.
[323:19.66]It's a regular stream for you.
[323:25.49]Hold on.
[323:25.73]There's like... Get those stars.
[323:26.95]So how does this... So if I take this character into my own Terraria game, it's going to be just empty, right?
[323:34.82]Yep.
[323:35.08]This is on your local drive, right?
[323:37.14]Mm-hmm.
[323:40.91]If I open a new Terraria game, just not multiplayer, will I have to be a level zero shitty?
[323:47.11]You can join with this character again, but everything in that world will need to be done again.
[323:52.99]Like how we defeated the skeleton to go into the dungeon.
[323:56.25]That hasn't happened in that world.
[323:58.05]You have to beat him again.
[323:59.48]If you want to continue playing, I can just leave it open.
[324:05.82]I'm just going to do some reading.
[324:10.94]I'm gonna... Am I at max mana?
[324:21.41]If you can't use them, yeah.
[324:22.51]Then give me the ones you haven't used.
[324:26.01]I'm gonna do a little bit of reading so I'm more knowledgeable next time.
[324:29.18]At least like by 2%.
[324:29.92]Okay.
[324:34.21]And do you actually want to do this again?
[324:37.03]Like on Saturday?
[324:37.93]Like next Saturday?
[324:38.83]No, I was joking.
[324:40.63]Well, I don't know.
[324:41.89]Sometimes you say things and then you write, like, in Discord after the stream's over, you write, like, you really think that I'm going to play with you?
[324:50.92]That's definitely happened.
[324:53.60]And then I have to pretend, like, oh, no, something came up.
[324:56.58]I don't know what happened.
[324:59.42]Alright, well, I'll just see you later.
[325:02.79]Have a well-deserved rest after an eight-hour stream.
[325:06.39]Thank you, honey.
[325:07.09]Oh my god, I hear more stars.
[325:09.97]And you didn't give me the mana crystal that you didn't use.
[325:12.31]I just threw it.
[325:12.89]Yes, I did.
[325:14.40]I just gave it to you.
[325:16.22]No, you didn't.
[325:17.22]I threw it right there.
[325:20.07]I want more.
[325:22.16]I will see you guys later.
[325:24.66]We'll do the end of the stream here, but... Goodbye, Star.
[325:29.70]Always a pleasure.
[325:31.46]We'll see you next time.
[325:33.16]For Terraria... He's still on the call.
[325:38.50]I thought he was going to do his thing that he does.
[325:40.36]No.
[325:42.43]I don't do anything.
[325:43.81]Where you just... You're gone.
[325:45.60]I'm going.
[325:46.14]Are you actually going to say goodbye to my stream for the first time in like four streams?
[325:51.82]Goodbye, Jerma's stream.
[325:54.48]I hope you enjoyed the playthrough of Terraria.
[325:57.87]And I hope you look forward to the continuing episodes that will result from it.
[326:02.33]I don't think you have ever done that in at least the last like seven streams.
[326:07.17]You've always just kind of been gone somehow.
[326:10.09]There you go.
[326:11.26]I think you're wrong.
[326:12.40]I'm not.
[326:14.32]I think I left one time as a joke no the last three or four times it's been a joke you and you've even turned your stream off and like ceased all contact for the rest of the day you're dedicated I'll give you that uh lag says Jerma usually mutes me oh okay thank you you're not muted now are you
[326:41.14]alright well goodbye I don't do I just how many times do I have to do it are you satisfied one more we'll do it I think goodbye Jerma and Jerma's chat I hope you enjoyed this we'll play again goodbye star and stars when I say things it's not a joke and I'm not sarcastic I actually mean the thing so I 100 mean it when I say what about hillary's emails
[327:11.96]I'm, like, just realizing right now that, like, that... That joke that came up, like, four or five times would have been funny, like, three years ago.
[327:23.85]What... We were on that for, like... At least ten minutes.
[327:27.92]Alright, give me the Spongebob soup thing.
[327:47.84]There's even a time stamp.
[327:51.58]This is it.
[327:52.56]I'm so ready for this.
[327:53.50]You have no idea.
[327:56.73]I've never been more ready for something in my whole life.
[328:07.35]Why is it not showing?
[328:10.37]How about some soup on your best day ever?
[328:18.22]It's a little hot.
[328:27.84]I don't think soup is the best thing for him on his best day ever.
[328:33.17]How about some music on your best day ever?
[328:36.65]Music isn't best either.
[328:38.77]But what is best is what we save for last.
[328:42.03]The one surefire thing to make your best day ever.
[328:45.88]Alright, that's enough.
[328:46.94]I'm not gonna get in trouble.
[328:47.78]That's enough.
[329:02.23]What a cliffhanger.
[329:02.99]Just go watch that episode if you want to see what happened.
[329:08.17]But I'll see you guys later.
[329:10.35]I will be back in a few days.
[329:12.83]I think we're going to start next week with the GTA Casino.
[329:22.24]It came out.
[329:22.98]I kind of have to play that.
[329:25.52]How could I not do the GTA Online Casino?
[329:45.98]When?
[329:47.08]So this would be... Let's say Saturday... Sunday, Monday... We'll come back on Wednesday.
[329:52.97]We'll do the same thing we did this last week here.
[329:57.09]We'll do a, like, Wednesday... Now, I don't have a schedule, but Wednesday to Saturday sounds like... Especially with this new Terraria Saturday thing.
[330:08.16]Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[330:10.68]Same thing we did this week.
[330:17.59]Saturday was for DOS?
[330:18.51]Well, we have to change that up.
[330:21.93]Hey, Star, no.
[330:22.65]We're playing Terraria on Fridays now.
[330:27.80]He invited me.
[330:29.44]You don't switch that around.
[330:31.38]You know, you don't go to somebody's house when they invite you to their house, and then they change their decorations and move their furniture around.
[330:48.04]If you do, don't do that anymore.
[330:52.17]But I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[330:56.23]Thanks for watching.
[330:57.71]Terraria is actually pretty fun.
[331:00.59]I get to experience this because I never really... I've tried to open it up a couple times.
[331:04.96]I got it on iPad, weirdly enough.
[331:08.48]And maybe put like 30 minutes into it before I realized I needed to put a lot of time into it.
[331:13.97]And I really didn't want to lie in bed for like 5, 6, 7 straight hours playing it on iPad.
[331:25.14]So I was like, I don't really want to do this.
[331:26.54]And then I never did it.
[331:28.06]I never really got into it.
[331:28.92]I didn't put the time that is necessary to get something out of it.
[331:38.43]I don't know, maybe we'll see if anybody else wants to, along the way, jump in and play it or something.
[331:53.09]You know.
[331:55.65]But, we... we're gonna do the bits.
[331:58.83]Shouldn't take us too long.
[332:00.97]Is the stream over?
[332:01.63]Yeah.
[332:02.61]I think that's a pretty good... I don't really have anything that I'd want to start.
[332:08.15]Five and a half hours in.
[332:10.89]I'd rather just, uh, start fresh on Wednesday.
[332:15.53]Why can't I play good games?
[332:17.53]Isn't Terraria one of, like, the most critically acclaimed games like that that exists?
[332:27.87]What?
[332:29.09]It is, right?
[332:32.67]If you were to ask somebody, is Terraria a good game, I would say probably eight or nine out of ten people would probably say yes.
[332:40.80]What classifies a good game?
[332:47.46]How many people buy it?
[332:48.38]How many people review it?
[332:49.48]I don't know.
[333:05.15]But let's go back.
[333:06.75]See you guys on Wednesday.
[333:07.47]Thanks for watching.
[333:08.39]Call to personality.
[333:09.27]Thanks for the $2.50.
[333:11.93]I'm playing Shadowrun with friends, so I'll have to watch the VOD.
[333:15.34]Wanted to send bits your way anyway.
[333:17.38]Enjoy the game with your buds.
[333:19.20]Build lots of commie block.
[333:24.54]What does that mean?
[333:34.33]The houses.
[333:35.95]Oh.
[333:41.57]Why is that a... That's just what you... You just put people in, like... The shoebox?
[333:54.14]I would just let them roam free.
[334:00.64]Hey, Helios.
[334:01.18]Thanks for the 280.
[334:02.10]Happy birthday, Jerma.
[334:05.03]You're a little off, but thank you so much.
[334:08.05]I appreciate it.
[334:14.32]We had a lot of money come in earlier.
[334:16.44]We grabbed them all.
[334:18.62]But thank you to Timmy and Chunky Baloney for your $50 bit donations that came in a few hours ago.
[334:24.89]That's a lot of fucking money.
[334:26.89]Thank you.
[334:32.61]The continued generosity of some of you guys is mind-blowing.
[334:38.20]No one's under any obligation to pay this stream any money, ever.
[334:41.32]Yet, some people do a lot.
[334:43.42]And... Thank you.
[334:45.38]I wish there was more I could say.
[334:55.91]But let's do the credits.
[334:59.98]Throw them up there.
[335:00.70]Why not?
[335:02.00]Here they come.
[335:03.56]Here come those.
[335:04.02]These are all the subs and resubs and gifted subs that happened during the course of the stream.
[335:10.60]Thanks to all of you, as always.
[335:15.88]We have a few more bits to do, but get it up there now, alright?
[335:26.23]Thank you to Freudian Weapon for the $5.
[335:29.63]Gosh darn it, Jerma, you're really making me want to pick Terraria back up.
[335:33.67]But on another note, do you plan on streaming Mario Maker 2 again?
[335:36.45]I've got a level in the works that's sure to knock your socks off.
[335:42.75]Yeah, I'll do that next week.
[335:45.33]I'll try to do... We'll do the GTA Casino.
[335:48.97]We'll do another Sam & Max episode.
[335:51.61]We'll do Mario Maker 2 again.
[335:55.15]And then I really want to start to, over the next week or so, try to get this dumb Highlights Magazine stream rules and stuff started.
[336:05.28]So that'll probably come out shortly.
[336:11.49]That's what you can expect next week when I come back.
[336:26.50]I think I've had enough break from Mario Maker 2 to come back and lose my mind again.
[336:33.22]Uh, thank you to EU Fawa.
[336:36.80]EU Fawa for the five dollars.
[336:40.28]They say, love the stream, Jerma.
[336:41.16]You always make my day better.
[336:42.30]But something needs to happen about the trans slur arguments that happen almost every stream.
[336:48.21]It really hurts seeing such toxic debates spark from such a generous and fantastic streamer like you.
[336:53.47]Love you lots, Jerma.
[336:54.13]Sorry about the chat misbehaving today.
[336:58.03]Yeah, honestly, I think it's... Everybody kind of just needs to relax.
[337:07.62]And there's really no reason to get angry or upset about something like that.
[337:16.03]We're here to just hang out and have a good time.
[337:19.53]We're just here to have fun, we're here to relax...
[337:23.27]There really shouldn't be that kind of fighting like that in the chat.
[337:28.05]And I don't really want to press too hard on this.
[337:35.26]But we're here for a very specific reason.
[337:39.26]I'm not here to really go over anything else besides us to forget the world around us, enjoy a game, and hang out together.
[337:52.75]Try to be nicer to each other.
[338:01.25]Now, that doesn't mean... Everything has to be... Everything's positive.
[338:04.48]Everything has to be positive all day, every day.
[338:06.04]Everything's positive, positive, positive.
[338:09.02]But be nice to each other.
[338:13.44]We fuck around here a lot.
[338:15.12]We really do.
[338:18.10]But there's a difference between like fucking around and like being angry with each other and fucking hating each other.
[338:26.07]I don't think that's necessarily been too far down there.
[338:37.62]But this stream is a very, very, very... I don't really talk about...
[338:45.45]what I believe, and the things that I care about, and politics, maybe the politics joke earlier, right?
[338:51.37]But like, and this is obviously politics and social issues.
[338:55.54]I don't really do that.
[339:05.80]If there's ever an avenue for us to really start to discuss those things, then that's when it'll happen.
[339:16.39]but try to be, like, better to each other and nicer to each other.
[339:22.04]We don't have to have these big arguments like that in chat.
[339:25.30]And I try to... Because here's another part, right?
[339:29.27]Once you start to... I don't want to fan the flames, because, you know, obviously putting it in sub only is easy to kind of, oh, let's just, like, cool it down for a little bit.
[339:58.02]Yeah, well, that's why I separated stuff like politics from like social issues and like you mentioned like human rights issues, right?
[340:10.35]You can't like lump everything together because they're very different.
[340:21.76]And in the rules, there are- I have rules here at the bottom of the stream.
[340:28.07]It does very clearly say, don't talk about politics.
[340:31.95]Don't talk about any bigot shit.
[340:35.27]No racist shit.
[340:37.33]I really feel like I don't have to say that.
[340:42.74]Just like, just relax a little.
[340:44.98]We don't have to do that here.
[340:54.17]I can't tell you what to think.
[341:00.88]I can't tell you what to believe.
[341:02.54]I can't tell you how to live your life.
[341:05.52]But all I can tell you is at least try to respect the people around you to a point that everybody deserves.
[341:14.27]Just for being a person in the first place.
[341:22.98]that's not the intention of these streams I'm not a person a multi-billion dollar corporation Jerma985.
[341:54.40]Are we allowed to hate you?
[341:55.84]Like I said, I can't change somebody's mind.
[342:01.66]I can't tell you to, like, not be a certain way.
[342:06.32]I can want that to be the case.
[342:15.09]But we all gotta exist here.
[342:19.19]Just respect your peers here.
[342:22.05]There's no reason for it.
[342:24.64]That's not what we're doing here.
[342:30.36]Anyways.
[342:30.70]I feel like I've made a pretty... Big statement here.
[342:37.92]About... I don't really talk about this kind of stuff.
[342:41.22]Ever, really.
[342:42.22]I mean, ever.
[342:44.44]And there's a reason for it.
[342:46.94]Hopefully I could at least make that point somewhat clear.
[342:59.16]But, regardless of any of this... Thank you for the five dollars.
[343:08.65]Appreciate it.
[343:14.39]You underestimate how addicted he is to gambling.
[343:22.75]I'm not that addicted to gambling.
[343:26.16]It's fun sometimes in a fake video game.
[343:40.43]He moved to Vegas.
[343:42.63]Yeah, but there are casinos here.
[343:44.52]Guess what?
[343:44.74]There are casinos in New England too.
[343:49.68]They just opened up one.
[343:52.84]Boston just brought in one of the biggest casinos in New England.
[344:02.64]I couldn't have gambled there.
[344:08.39]You would know.
[344:09.77]Yeah, I would know, because it was one of the biggest construction and projects the state had ever seen.
[344:15.63]Wait, do I live under a rock?
[344:20.14]That was happening before I moved.
[344:38.05]Prove you're not addicted and don't play any gambling games for a year.
[344:45.02]Playing Terraria is a gambling game.
[344:47.90]You kill monsters and hope they drop the thing that you want.
[344:52.12]Should I never play a loot-based game ever again?
[344:54.24]That's kind of a gamble.
[344:59.96]You kill the same boss like 20 times to see if... You open the Hearthstone packs to try to get the stuff in there to get the...
[345:09.76]This is the logic that EA used.
[345:27.92]EA used the aw- yeah, what?
[345:29.26]EA didn't use that logic.
[345:30.46]I'm- I'm good.
[345:31.88]I got it.
[345:35.04]Is loot box politics?
[345:52.27]It sadly is, to an extent.
[345:59.68]TF2 is gambling.
[346:02.06]Hey, easy now.
[346:04.08]Easy now.
[346:04.60]Alright, only a couple more we got.
[346:10.69]Nick just came in with $50.
[346:15.13]A few minutes ago, we were in the middle of talking about some things, but thank you, Nick, for the 5,000 bits, 50 bucks.
[346:23.99]That's a huge amount of money, right at the very end.
[346:25.61]Uh, they said, um, Quentin Twitch, just wanted to thank you for one of my favorite streamers of all time.
[346:33.86]Thank you for the $50.
[346:35.62]Nick, hopefully, um, Quentin Twitch.
[346:44.13]The thing is, uh, let's say that, you know, if that's for real, sometimes you kind of have to unplug a little, you know?
[346:55.72]Social media is great.
[346:57.74]Streaming stuff is great.
[346:58.60]I mean, sometimes you gotta do something else, you know?
[347:03.68]Pull your brain out a little.
[347:12.64]I barely even... I barely participate in social media.
[347:17.29]Look at my Twitter.
[347:17.89]Look at my Facebook.
[347:22.76]But regardless of your reasons, Nick, thank you so much.
[347:28.60]Thank you for the $50.
[347:31.47]And maybe we'll see you again another time.
[347:33.91]If not, then good luck with whatever you do.
[347:40.73]Backen gave $2.50.
[347:42.93]I already posted this before on Discord and on chat, but I made a Jerma tier list tier list.
[347:50.97]Oh my god.
[347:52.90]that you could do or not.
[347:56.48]Maybe at the very end I would do one of these.
[347:59.10]Why would I... Why would I do one of these?
[348:05.25]Thank you for the 250, though.
[348:07.95]Ferodium Whippet, thanks for the 250.
[348:09.27]I would not be against Terraria Saturdays.
[348:21.20]Neither would I.
[348:28.58]That's why I'm doing it.
[348:32.12]Yeah, just keep adding them.
[348:33.46]I'm going to do at least another four or five of those over the next month.
[348:51.85]And with that... Sorry, I'm just clicking over here.
[348:55.66]With that, I will see you guys in a few days.
[348:58.61]We'll do the GTA Casino, Sam & Max, Mario Maker, and then Terraria Saturday.
[349:05.92]With Stern, maybe some other people.
[349:08.08]I don't know.
[349:11.66]You should host Critical.
[349:16.69]It's Critical streaming right now.
[349:23.57]What's it doing?
[349:40.00]Let me get over there.
[349:50.99]Why is- I'm- I'm- I'm- How am I not falling?
[349:58.85]What is Critical's name?
[349:59.97]Am I not following Critical?
[350:05.87]Oh, damn.
[350:06.43]Okay, right, right, right, right, right.
[350:09.92]I was thinking, like, wait, why isn't he here?
[350:13.42]Alright, yeah, we'll go say hello to Critical.
[350:19.21]It's been a very long time since we've said hello.
[350:27.24]Raid Etalyx.
[350:28.18]Etalyx is right there.
[350:29.38]I don't have to go far to raid him.
[350:32.40]He's right there.
[350:34.68]Half of you go over there, and half of you go here.
[350:38.38]Oh, but I can tell you something about Taxman.
[350:39.84]Etalyx are going to play... I'm trying to get Swap4 to work.
[350:47.13]You might see an Etalyx in Jerma co-op stream.
[350:52.85]We were talking about it.
[350:53.79]Not next week.
[350:54.79]There's a lot to go into that.
[350:59.94]Because I think we have to set up a LAN and it's going to take a little bit.
[351:05.70]We were talking about it, though.
[351:12.79]Oh, friendship week.
[351:14.05]Yeah.
[351:15.31]Alright, guys.
[351:16.31]Just go say hello to... It's been a long time since we've said hello to Critical.
[351:24.17]Queue it up.
[351:29.06]And I... Is he watching a John Cena video?
[351:34.70]I have no idea what he's doing.
[351:37.63]Cue it up.
[351:39.27]I will see you guys in a few days.
[351:40.59]Ferodian Weapon, thank you, Ferodian, for the 250.
[351:42.65]Last Minute Bits, LUL, thank you.
[351:47.23]I will see you guys later.
[351:51.61]Goodbye.
[351:52.59]Take care.
[351:53.45]See you Wednesday.
[351:55.09]Have a great night.
