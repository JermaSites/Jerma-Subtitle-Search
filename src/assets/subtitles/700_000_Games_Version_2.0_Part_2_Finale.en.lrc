[ve:61.7.100]

[00:01.17]Welcome to the new year.
[00:04.89]Welcome to the new year.
[00:07.99]To the new year.
[00:09.97]Welcome to the new year, right?
[00:11.93]It's kind of how I just said that.
[00:26.12]No, that wasn't even, I wasn't making a joke.
[00:37.89]Alright, hold on.
[00:38.81]One sec.
[00:42.21]So, with Road Stream... Ah, eh, eh.
[00:44.59]Hold on a minute.
[00:45.09]I gotta stop the road.
[00:45.91]Let's start in a minute.
[00:47.99]Ugh.
[00:49.89]Slowly turning into the... emote that I truly, truly am.
[00:57.65]I'll be right back.
[00:58.45]Just gonna grab one more thing.
[01:00.45]Hey!
[01:01.19]Only like 382,000 more games left to play.
[01:02.47]See you in a moment.
[02:00.98]Okay, I'm sitting here trying to clear my throat.
[02:05.58]Sinuses, my nasal passages.
[02:09.34]This Vegas air.
[02:12.53]Some of the cleanest in the world.
[02:15.99]I kind of get this frog throat that after like an hour goes away.
[02:24.39]But yeah, today the plan,
[02:28.59]You know, I could probably, today, oh man, I could probably do a pretty good Dutch right now.
[02:32.79]With this kind of Vegas nose and Vegas throat.
[02:36.14]Arthur, I've got a plan, Arthur.
[02:39.02]You stick to the plan.
[02:42.82]No, not deep enough.
[02:44.50]Arthur, you need to have a little faith, Arthur.
[02:53.20]That wasn't bad.
[03:07.59]He's making that face right now.
[03:09.13]I make that face every single morning when I get up.
[03:13.79]That's the first image that you see when you see me in bed.
[03:20.08]In fact, that image was taken.
[03:22.72]Kim took that picture.
[03:25.88]I got up.
[03:26.70]We both sat up at the same time.
[03:28.50]So I, you know, Undertaker Rose and made that face.
[03:31.66]She snapped a picture.
[03:35.52]And right after that I said, oh, my back is killing me.
[03:45.46]In bed?
[03:47.23]O-W-O?
[03:48.45]Why did I read that out loud?
[03:51.37]So who did the filter thing?
[03:53.67]What filter?
[03:59.61]What filter?
[04:00.15]I don't know what you mean.
[04:05.37]I've never taken a photo with a filter in my life.
[04:07.97]That's not real.
[04:10.01]I want to show people reality.
[04:12.48]The real me.
[04:15.28]No dog noses on this streamer, I'll tell you that much.
[04:19.72]Alright, so here's what we're doing.
[04:22.53]We're gonna do the rest of the 700,000 games.
[04:24.43]Last night got to a point
[04:27.05]Where was... I was a little... I was kind of exhausted.
[04:30.70]So I figured we'd just close it out today.
[04:33.14]And... I'm not sure what's gonna happen after.
[04:35.78]Because this might actually take us... Like, at least three, maybe four hours to do this.
[04:43.50]So, I... This might be another full stream.
[04:47.60]Because there are a lot left.
[04:54.28]And then we could probably maybe take the things that we were going to do afterwards and just do them another time.
[05:00.92]I never like to just rush into shit, you know?
[05:02.68]I like to take my time.
[05:05.42]Like right now.
[05:06.55]I've been live for five minutes, and we're at the starting soon screen.
[05:11.87]And the Spaz just gave five community subs.
[05:15.29]Coming in, going, boom!
[05:18.49]Dropping some community subs.
[05:19.33]Thank you so much, Spaz.
[05:23.87]My husband listens to you more than me.
[05:30.15]You listening right now?
[05:32.31]Communication is so important in a relationship.
[05:37.46]Listening to each other's needs and wants and making sure that you're both taken care of.
[05:41.90]It's very important, Rick.
[05:52.18]Jeremy never listens to me.
[05:59.50]Alright, that's enough of the intro screen, what do you say?
[06:01.48]Here, this, that, okay, it looks like a lot of X's.
[06:04.77]But trust me, it's not.
[06:06.59]It isn't.
[06:08.31]That may look like a lot of X's, but when you take the X's away, we got like half the games here.
[06:16.15]It's an optical illusion.
[06:17.21]Speaking of optical illusions, I want to make sure I bring this up before we go and even start here.
[06:23.88]How do I look today?
[06:25.40]No, that's not what I, that's not the thing that I want to talk about, but...
[06:29.88]Let's see how bad this is.
[06:32.32]I'm gonna look like such shit.
[06:33.65]Let's find out.
[06:34.27]Ready?
[06:34.95]You wanna be the big face reveal for today?
[06:36.85]Not that bad.
[06:44.67]What's wrong with the camera though?
[06:53.12]Do I look like weird to anybody else today?
[06:56.94]Do I have eyebrows?
[06:58.34]What happened to my eyebrows?
[07:03.13]No, they're there.
[07:06.75]I forgot to pencil in my eyebrows!
[07:10.43]You look shattered.
[07:14.94]I think I'm just- I am actually just getting old.
[07:18.46]I look at- yeah, look at this.
[07:19.66]I'm gonna have to start wearing, like, makeup.
[07:25.57]Ugh.
[07:28.70]Aging rapidly.
[07:29.72]Yeah, it's been one day.
[07:31.12]No, it's the lighting.
[07:31.92]Hold on.
[07:32.32]It's Philips Hue.
[07:34.74]Philips Hue.
[07:35.74]Oh, no, you don't speak to it.
[07:36.96]It's not like Alexa.
[07:38.47]It's the lights.
[07:38.95]Hold on.
[07:47.03]You look like Draco Malfoy.
[07:51.09]Well, my house is Slytherin.
[07:52.57]Does that make sense?
[07:58.56]Let's make this better.
[08:05.64]No.
[08:07.38]No.
[08:10.28]No, because I don't like this because I feel like I'm in a movie theater.
[08:13.94]Now, let me ask you.
[08:14.88]This is very important.
[08:16.32]Before we get to the thing, before getting to the thing, before getting to the thing I originally wanted to talk about, does anybody else here hate going to the fucking movies during the day?
[08:23.74]I do.
[08:25.04]I fucking despise it.
[08:27.06]Ugh.
[08:29.51]No, yeah, because the lights.
[08:32.23]It's like 1 o'clock in the afternoon.
[08:33.66]A day movie.
[08:35.14]Hear me out on this.
[08:36.54]1 o'clock in the afternoon.
[08:38.20]Oh, yeah, let's go see a movie.
[08:39.18]You get in there and it's like, oh, yeah, let's go.
[08:41.44]It's bright summertime sunshine right now.
[08:44.16]It's like 95 degrees out.
[08:45.40]Let's get in that movie theater.
[08:49.18]That was just the right one.
[08:52.27]Here.
[08:52.37]Here.
[08:55.85]The whole, I can't, it's light out right now.
[08:57.95]So this is not, this reference isn't going to work and I'm just going to have to describe it to you, okay?
[09:02.27]It's currently light out right now and I'm turning the lights off in the room like it's going to do anything.
[09:06.33]I hate going to the movies when it's light because you get in there and it's pitch black and you have this beaming light in your face.
[09:12.91]It's as if you're holding a fucking iPad in front of your face.
[09:15.81]And then it's like for two hours, you come out, you're like, oh, and it's like so bright.
[09:21.69]I need to go to bed after a movie.
[09:23.81]Greasy hair?
[09:24.39]No, it's shower.
[09:28.36]I feel like it needs to be dark outside to see a movie.
[09:35.07]That's at any time.
[09:35.73]No, at night.
[09:37.01]At night, it's... The sky is black.
[09:42.25]Coming out of a movie at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, it's like... It's like drinking during the day.
[09:48.53]Like that... No, it's like the same feeling.
[09:52.45]I feel like I'm just like... I don't like any of this.
[09:58.18]Yeah, the sky is black.
[09:59.20]Yeah, it is.
[10:01.20]It's a scientific little Elon Musk thing for you.
[10:04.24]The sky is scientific.
[10:06.40]Tesla taught me that.
[10:07.16]The sky is blue and black.
[10:11.99]He's stalling.
[10:13.13]Well, I'm not stalling.
[10:21.49]He's stalling.
[10:28.35]Spaz gave another five community subs.
[10:32.17]You guys wouldn't believe how much light actually fucks with you.
[10:36.53]Light gets inside and fucks with your brain.
[10:40.47]You know why it's so hard to fall asleep sometimes at night?
[10:43.82]Because you got that light.
[10:46.18]Humans are all just made out of light.
[10:51.08]You know, you're 70% light.
[10:57.29]So which one are we going to?
[10:58.79]What would you guys say if you were to make a choice here?
[11:06.63]And by choice, I mean, click on the screen.
[11:17.14]14 year old philosopher.
[11:18.78]Well, we're definitely not gonna do, I keep calling it checkers.
[11:25.53]Oh, I forgot, yeah, right, the optical illusion.
[11:27.95]Alright, so here, hear me out on this, this is for real, while you're voting.
[11:31.65]Can I just see a shitload of the jermaOld emote, please?
[11:36.12]And I want you to look at it.
[11:37.36]When it's next to other jermaOld emotes, at least three or four of them.
[11:44.08]It looks like a different emote.
[11:45.88]It changes, the face changes.
[11:48.41]It's a fucked up optical illusion that I did not intend.
[11:53.61]Some of them are, like, smirking, some of them have a frown, it's really weird.
[12:01.17]Well, actually, this is impossible, because the chat is going way too fast.
[12:07.84]Some of them look older than others.
[12:09.06]Alright, how do I turn the chat off for a second?
[12:12.56]Because I'll do it.
[12:15.10]Any mods know how to just turn off the chat?
[12:18.47]Like, can I just turn the chat off for, like, two minutes or something?
[12:28.70]Is there a way to do that?
[12:32.90]Does this do anything?
[12:33.74]Oh my fucking god.
[12:36.16]Just scroll up.
[12:40.84]Streamer bans 3000 people.
[12:42.16]You can't stop us.
[12:52.07]Well, anyways, okay, when you have some free time, just do the jermaOld emote a shitload of times and look at them.
[12:58.85]They start moving, they start talking, they start talking to you.
[13:02.71]I had a whole conversation with three of them.
[13:05.75]Alright, so we're going to Distinct Worlds.
[13:09.85]I don't know what that is, Distinct Worlds?
[13:20.44]What is that, what is it called?
[13:25.29]Robotic worlds.
[13:27.09]Okay.
[13:28.45]Cross your fingers.
[13:29.05]Let's hope it works.
[13:32.65]It works.
[13:33.61]Now, but it's going to be an issue of hopefully I can even open it.
[13:43.10]That was fucking loud.
[13:43.84]Just give me a second.
[13:49.10]Aye yi yi.
[13:57.33]Uh, I have no idea.
[13:59.19]I can't even see what I'm selecting.
[14:05.46]What am I even clicking on?
[14:09.06]I don't know what I just did.
[14:10.86]The music stopped.
[14:11.90]That's all that happened.
[14:13.44]I gotta reopen this.
[14:16.40]What the fuck?
[14:17.14]Alright.
[14:17.60]No more votes.
[14:18.34]Thank you for voting.
[14:19.04]I appreciate the votes.
[14:21.26]Yeah, I turned it off because it was just so loud and so horrible.
[14:25.22]But it's gonna happen again.
[14:26.14]So, I'm gonna go like this.
[14:27.84]Let's see if you guys can see it.
[14:31.90]Let's try it again.
[14:33.28]This time I'm gonna have to not move.
[14:38.50]Robotic Worlds.
[14:40.22]Incoming.
[14:48.09]That's it.
[14:49.07]That's Robotic Worlds.
[14:50.21]What a great game.
[14:52.71]It's fantastic.
[15:08.30]Okay.
[15:09.34]That was Robotic Worlds.
[15:15.16]Rigged.
[15:19.15]There's nothing I can do about that one.
[15:20.57]Thank you.
[15:20.93]Thanks for voting for it because it don't work.
[15:30.69]Where is this?
[15:32.49]Where am I?
[15:33.05]Robotic Worlds.
[15:35.97]It seems like all the interesting ones just are the ones that don't work.
[15:41.83]Try again.
[15:42.79]Don't click on a red X. Don't click on a red X or it might ball up the tiles around it.
[15:48.30]Okay, people are liking the, uh... Got a riverboat.
[16:02.99]We've got a mermaid.
[16:07.54]Uh, nasty diamonds.
[16:12.41]And there, you know, there's always going to be 10 to 15% of every person that's going to click on Connect Four.
[16:20.67]Even when explicitly told, this is my favorite part, even when explicitly told, this is the human mind at work, explicitly told that that, I'm not going to play it.
[16:32.56]I'm not going to click that.
[16:33.52]It's not going to happen.
[16:36.37]Gonna do it anyways.
[16:43.05]Nasty diamonds.
[16:44.35]Sounds like a strip club.
[16:54.12]Chaotic neutral chat.
[17:02.68]No, uh, 50%.
[17:04.58]How many, how many fucking chaotic doofuses are in here right now?
[17:09.66]That's what I wonder.
[17:12.22]Well, it's this one up here.
[17:13.22]It's, uh, Aquamaria.
[17:15.80]I don't know what that is.
[17:16.60]Let's see.
[17:17.12]Aqua, what's it called?
[17:18.59]Aquamania.
[17:26.47]Awful stupid.
[17:27.59]Lawful stupid.
[17:28.37]I remember that whole thing.
[17:29.23]That was fun.
[17:31.09]Okay.
[17:31.39]Let's see if this one works.
[17:32.57]Aquamania.
[17:38.08]It's opening.
[17:39.26]It's closing.
[17:40.46]Aquamania.
[17:45.64]Okay.
[17:46.72]Two in a row.
[17:47.48]Is strike three going to happen?
[17:57.06]Let's strike two.
[17:59.06]Okay.
[18:02.16]Really, we're really picking great ones.
[18:04.82]And it's not even anybody's fault.
[18:06.26]It's, it's this video game's fault.
[18:11.08]I really am curious as to, we have to keep an eye on which ones don't work.
[18:14.70]Alright, aqua, aqua, there it is.
[18:22.64]Uh, try again?
[18:24.98]Strike three ends the stream.
[18:28.19]No, I just turned it on.
[18:37.20]All I hear is a faint slap when that picture comes up.
[18:41.42]Jeremy, just play the game.
[18:44.08]I just tried.
[18:45.04]I just tried to do two different games.
[18:52.52]Alright, we're gonna do looks like a riverboat.
[18:57.28]Riverboat.
[18:59.06]Extreme riverboat challenge or something.
[19:01.45]Whatever the hell it is.
[19:06.48]That is over there on that second pack.
[19:11.04]Alright, riverboat.
[19:14.06]I'm not gonna do connect four.
[19:18.47]Extreme riverboat racing.
[19:24.65]Well, it opens.
[19:27.15]What a good sign.
[19:31.72]The question is, can I get this in a window?
[19:38.65]Alright, you got me, you know, you hooked me, oh.
[19:41.83]What?
[19:42.07]Wait, why?
[19:42.77]You don't, hold on.
[19:43.93]You don't have 1920 by 1080, but you have 2048 by 1536.
[19:45.85]What resolutions are you even attempting here?
[20:08.28]What monitor size is this?
[20:10.12]Is this like a vertical 28 inch monitor?
[20:14.96]I don't get it.
[20:20.10]Run riverboat again to change resolute.
[20:22.21]Okay.
[20:23.31]Well, let's run riverboat again.
[20:31.31]Five by four.
[20:32.39]No, that's like a five by two vertical.
[20:36.15]Riverboat.
[20:36.91]Let's open it again.
[20:37.61]Let's see if this can... Hopefully it makes it better.
[20:39.35]Hopefully it's not just like a fucking cube in the corner of your screen.
[20:48.64]Are you trying to tell me that I made it unopenable?
[20:55.89]No fucking way.
[21:02.75]I made it- I've made the game unopenable by changing its resolution.
[21:14.34]I didn't do anything!
[21:17.18]Why?
[21:21.60]Hold on, let me like- oh my god, why is this happening?
[21:26.82]I'm gonna have to go edit the INI file.
[21:28.62]Yeah, if I don't- does it even have one?
[21:38.33]Oh my god.
[21:43.18]This is fucking ridiculous.
[21:44.82]Okay, what the hell is this thing called?
[21:46.86]River Boat Challenge?
[21:54.65]I'm shocked that this is three in a row here.
[21:59.03]This is not even on a list.
[22:01.77]Best game hits five and six.
[22:04.71]It's not even here.
[22:05.75]It deleted itself when I changed the resolution.
[22:11.71]Yeah, that's what happened.
[22:13.64]The game deleted its own folder when I changed its resolution.
[22:29.36]No, there it is, okay.
[22:31.14]It's extreme riverboat racing, not just riverboat racing.
[22:35.31]Okay, here we go.
[22:37.07]Data.
[22:38.17]Graphics.
[22:40.13]Menu.
[22:42.09]D3E.
[22:43.31]No, this is none of this.
[22:44.59]No INI.
[22:45.31]There's nothing here.
[22:50.60]No, it's over.
[22:51.28]I can't... I can open it in safe mode, but this is a batch file.
[22:54.46]I'm not double-clicking a batch file.
[22:58.60]Oh, what the fuck?
[22:59.46]Hold on.
[22:59.86]Alright, maybe... Okay, what if I just run it in 640x430?
[23:09.13]I can do it
[23:12.38]Okay, I can force the game into 640x480 in the compatibility tab.
[23:18.03]Let's see what happens.
[23:25.97]Did it work?
[23:29.51]Nope.
[23:50.07]And what would be causing something like that?
[23:52.49]That's such a specifically awful bug.
[23:58.66]That changing the resolution of the game makes the game no longer able to open ever again.
[24:03.24]Even if you change it back.
[24:05.90]Holy shit.
[24:08.42]This is unbelievable.
[24:15.19]I don't even know what to say.
[24:19.71]Can I, like... Did you hear that little laugh?
[24:28.17]I'm gonna be honest with you here, though.
[24:32.47]I don't... Oh boy, this joke again.
[24:36.59]What?
[24:36.93]Which one?
[24:38.87]What did I do?
[24:40.90]What did I do?
[24:41.64]I should just be a country singer by the amount of times my voice cracks, seriously.
[25:00.14]Bring back Super Frog.
[25:03.22]No.
[25:05.58]Jerma is such a millennial.
[25:06.89]I am a millennial.
[25:08.29]Oh, I get what you're doing.
[25:08.97]You're doing like the reverse boomer thing.
[25:10.53]Okay, thanks.
[25:11.95]Alright, we're gonna go to Fantasy Island.
[25:13.21]36%.
[25:13.35]Fantasy Island.
[25:26.46]Rollerball Fantasy Island.
[25:28.16]Okay, are we going four for four?
[25:33.08]Is it possible to go four for four with games that don't work?
[25:43.72]It's opening it in the other window.
[25:50.08]Oh my god, don't open in the other window, open in this window!
[25:55.30]The one that's right here at my main monitor!
[26:02.21]What the fuck?
[26:06.53]Where is it gonna open?
[26:09.05]Rollerball Fantasy Island, start game.
[26:10.68]No, now it's opening in the main window!
[26:20.69]Not doing that again.
[26:21.47]I'm not doing that to you guys again.
[26:32.76]Graphics, come on.
[26:35.10]Resolution.
[26:35.84]Do I change the resolution?
[26:39.64]I'm afraid to change the resolution.
[26:42.26]Alright, we're gonna change the resolution to a 1152
[26:51.13]Alright.
[26:52.13]Cartoon style.
[26:53.22]Oh, I get it.
[26:53.82]It's like fucking it's in the newspaper.
[27:19.93]I need to like, make it, I need to drag it to the left at least.
[27:44.70]There's only so much of the same five-second loop in a speech volume.
[27:49.46]Oh, you lost.
[27:51.22]Oh, you're a booter.
[27:52.24]Wow.
[27:53.18]Oh, it was funny.
[27:56.50]Don't do it again.
[27:57.48]Why is this here?
[27:59.12]Sorry, but he's dead now.
[28:01.50]Oh, it was awful.
[28:06.02]You lost him.
[28:10.86]Oh, you're a booter.
[28:12.00]Wow.
[28:12.36]Oh, it was funny.
[28:14.91]Alright, I like this one.
[28:16.05]I like this one because of that guy's voice.
[28:17.27]It's the only good part about this.
[28:18.41]Alright, let's go.
[28:25.71]Original levels, lost levels.
[28:27.60]Like, anyone's going to click this.
[28:30.68]Snowland, Greenland, Fantasyland.
[28:32.32]Okay, which Sonic the Hedgehog level should I start at?
[28:34.50]I'm going to say Green Hill Zone.
[28:37.96]Oops.
[28:38.94]Oops.
[28:39.58]Oops.
[28:40.62]Oh.
[28:41.62]Oops.
[28:45.18]Normal, hard, easy.
[28:47.68]So what's the difference?
[28:49.92]It just adds more, like, fucking sprinkles?
[28:51.98]That's all it does?
[28:55.01]I'm just gonna do normal.
[28:59.13]Ready?
[28:59.83]Go!
[29:04.27]Now, touch flick!

[29:17.59]You know, alright.
[29:25.09]So, listen.
[29:26.61]I figured out what all these... These games are... the pre-loaded after-school games.
[29:35.44]Is that just Facebook?
[29:40.79]This is what is allowed on your eighth grade school computer.
[29:44.23]It's just the after school games.
[29:45.65]Did I miss one?
[29:47.45]Pass all the gates.
[29:49.95]I did that, right?
[29:50.55]The guy didn't scream at me, so I didn't do it.

[31:27.04]Go!
[31:33.12]It's the hitboxes that are the problem, not me and my big brain.
[31:48.11]Okay, let's try that again.
[31:49.27]Ready?
[31:58.18]Remember.
[31:58.56]Remember, guys.
[31:59.76]Jeremy's stupid.
[32:01.18]That's why I couldn't do that.
[32:03.24]Remember.
[32:04.34]Always remember.
[32:06.66]It's always Mr. Jeremy Svald.

[33:39.13]I just want to make sure I can get around there.
[33:49.28]I don't- who cares if I don't get all the coins?
[33:51.08]Does it really matter?
[33:52.04]Don't do it again!
[33:53.78]Ready?
[33:54.46]Go!
[33:54.90]Does it really matter if I don't get all the coins in this sloppy game?
[34:04.37]I've eaten fucking sloppy Joes that were easier to handle.
[34:15.90]Congratulations!
[34:17.26]Level is complete!
[34:20.96]This game's like Tommy Wiseau's dad.
[34:24.63]This game... Ready?
[34:25.73]Go!
[34:26.15]This game is Tommy Wiseau's dad.
[34:28.67]What?
[34:28.95]I don't... Maybe that went too fast for me to see what you wrote.
[34:40.16]What's happening?
[34:40.68]I'm stuck.
[34:46.65]Oh, stop it.
[34:47.88]Oh, troll level.
[34:48.82]Kaizo block.
[34:51.89]Ready?
[34:52.25]Go!
[35:11.55]Congratulations!
[35:12.93]Level is complete!
[35:14.99]Ready?
[35:15.41]Go!
[35:15.65]How are you bad at a game this easy?
[35:18.25]This... I don't think you understand.
[35:22.92]This game is very hard to control.
[35:24.82]Have you seen my ball?
[35:29.34]Ready?
[35:30.04]Go!
[35:33.34]It looks like it's based on physics, but it's not, I can assure you.
[35:36.44]It's based off of... I don't know, something else.
[35:46.32]Got out.
[35:47.06]Got out again.
[35:47.70]Oof, this is...
[36:19.71]There's no way to get up.
[36:20.73]There's no way for the player to be able to get back up.
[36:23.51]There was a skip over there.
[36:24.59]Oh, not again!
[36:26.81]Ready?
[36:27.51]Go!
[36:38.38]Sorry, but he's dead now.
[36:40.18]Ready?
[36:40.84]Go!
[36:42.68]It's not easy.
[36:44.08]It's not easy.
[36:44.70]Trust me when I say it's not easy.
[36:48.40]I understand that this is Serial Game, number 460, but you don't... Oh!
[36:57.04]That guy actually fell down and hit something.
[37:03.25]Well, that was fun.
[37:05.33]Oops!
[37:06.43]Oops!
[37:06.81]Oops!
[37:07.25]Oops!
[37:07.67]Oops!
[37:09.71]Oops!
[37:22.10]That was, uh, Boomer Ball.
[37:25.22]I don't know what it was called, actually.
[37:26.32]I have no idea.
[37:33.70]I'm not gonna do the Lost Levels.
[37:36.44]Oh, come- You want me to do the Lost Levels?
[37:39.49]I- Watch, I'm gonna open that and I'm not gonna be able to do it.
[37:42.47]Cause he's gonna say... No!
[37:44.33]No, it was- Oops!
[37:47.51]Fine, I'll prove it.
[37:48.38]I'll just click on Lost Levels and it's gonna say no.
[37:50.96]Just to make sure nobody... Because here's what's gonna happen if I don't do this.
[37:55.80]50% are gonna click on Connect Four, and 50% are gonna click on Lost Levels game again.
[38:01.37]And there's gonna be like four guys that actually vote for another game.
[38:06.03]So I have to do this.
[38:13.28]Let's go.
[38:36.77]It's the same thing.
[38:38.55]It's the same thing.
[38:39.49]It's not a lost level.
[38:45.26]Ready?
[38:45.94]Go!
[38:55.40]Ready?
[38:55.78]Go!
[38:56.12]Look at the amount of space that I have to get this.
[39:07.38]You have to do it like that.
[39:15.47]Even one pixel.
[39:16.74]Now, touch fleck, you'll ask him.
[39:20.66]Ready?
[39:21.30]Go!
[39:30.20]I don't know why you guys want me to be in this one.
[39:36.69]Actually, you know what?
[39:37.23]I know why.
[39:37.83]Because it's the only one that has worked since the stream has turned on.
[39:41.61]So I get it.
[39:42.59]No, I do understand.
[39:43.88]But I want to get cartoon mode off.
[39:47.02]Never mind.
[39:47.36]I can't.
[39:54.27]Graphics-wise, I really do appreciate the cell-shaded technology.
[40:02.65]How do I get those?
[40:03.27]Is there a jump?
[40:08.13]What?
[40:15.42]Oh.
[40:17.40]Congratulations!
[40:18.76]Level is complete!
[40:20.70]Ready?
[40:21.36]Go!
[40:21.90]Just jump.
[40:24.69]flags over there.
[40:26.81]Do the lost levels.
[40:32.95]How are these the lost levels?
[40:42.81]In my opinion, they're not lost if they're a clickable menu in the first, when you click on start game.
[40:52.58]Shouldn't this be like a sequence of events you have to do before you get to see the lost levels?
[40:57.06]They're very much found.
[40:58.06]They're right in front of you.
[41:01.78]It took Nintendo like 32 years to unleash the Lost Levels for Mario 1.
[41:06.81]I'm gonna do this one in 10 seconds.
[41:28.90]Congratulations!
[41:30.18]Level is complete!
[41:32.58]Ready?
[41:33.31]Go!
[41:34.47]That was currently at the 10 second mark.
[41:45.80]Oh no!
[41:49.08]Ready?
[41:49.46]Go!
[42:27.99]Actually a good game, yeah, it was.
[42:32.67]It's too bad it's never gonna be seen again ever from this channel.
[42:36.91]Maybe some other channel might play it and be like, nice, not me.
[42:42.18]Where the hell was that?
[42:44.82]I don't even know what that was.
[42:48.36]One through four is right there.
[42:53.59]I appreciate the joke to try to get me to open it again.
[42:56.01]There, look at everybody.
[42:58.13]A full quadrant.
[43:02.90]A full math class quadrant is still clicking on Connect Four.
[43:12.39]Now, okay, now you almost got a full, you obviously had a measuring cup there.
[43:15.45]You had a full measuring cup.
[43:25.98]So where are we going?
[43:27.46]Elf bowling.
[43:29.98]Cosmic elf bowling.
[43:31.16]Let's try it.
[43:38.48]Cosmic, Cosmo Alley bowling.
[43:43.29]Didn't I try this one last night and it didn't work?
[43:49.21]Yeah, did I forget to put one on here?
[43:50.91]This one doesn't work.
[43:53.87]I didn't put an X on this one.
[44:01.23]Okay.
[44:03.35]What's next?
[44:08.61]Put an X on every game.
[44:26.40]None of them have worked.
[44:27.86]Except for the Super Monkey Ball game.
[44:31.30]Yeah, we must have... We're getting all landmines today.
[44:35.30]We avoided a lot of landmines yesterday.
[44:38.47]Surprisingly.
[44:39.97]Mega Pinball is coming up.
[44:42.59]Let's see if it turns on.
[44:49.22]Hey, you know what works, dude?
[44:50.92]Connect Four.
[44:52.91]You're right, it does.
[44:53.73]Connect Four does work.
[45:06.75]Okay, that's just like somebody's engineered TF2 profile picture.
[45:15.65]High color, true color.
[45:19.22]Oh no, what have I done?
[45:21.31]I clicked on true color.
[45:27.21]Oh, I think I get a blue screen.
[45:28.93]Don't blue screen.
[45:39.50]God damn it.
[45:45.98]This is okay.
[45:46.96]This is what this means.
[45:49.06]You guys thought that this was maximize or minimize window?
[45:52.38]No, there are two windows.
[45:54.28]See, there's one and then one in front, one in front, one behind.
[45:57.09]This is just putting the window that's behind upfront.
[46:02.03]So it's just shuffling the two windows.
[46:04.21]You guys thought that was minimize maximize.
[46:05.75]I'm sorry, you're just wrong.
[46:11.00]Let me try to fix this.
[46:11.84]So I need to just stretch it out a little.
[46:19.96]So we're going to stretch it out and then down like that.
[46:25.60]Let's see if that does anything.
[46:32.69]A little.
[46:33.41]Almost.
[46:37.19]Pinball version 1.0.
[46:38.83]That's horseshit.
[46:39.39]That should be 2.0.
[46:39.99]Because this is version 2 of 700,000 games.
[46:43.43]Uh-oh.
[47:02.04]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[47:04.28]No, that's Cosmo Alley Bowling.
[47:05.88]Wrong one.
[47:06.38]Mega Pinball.
[47:16.27]That's as good as I'm gonna get it.
[47:17.85]I can't fucking around with it anymore.
[47:24.11]Is that even a pinball machine?
[47:25.29]Name player 1.
[47:31.49]What's with the suit?
[47:35.62]Pinball Mania 3D, and oh, but here's like a James Bond tuxedo.
[47:40.34]Alright, we're gonna go with this one.
[47:43.68]This one looks like a circus one or something.
[47:45.36]Go.
[47:54.03]I don't... what is... Even your grandmother likes Mega Pinball.
[47:59.21]Okay, well, how do I play?
[48:07.64]What's flipper?
[48:19.45]Z and X?
[48:22.15]Ah, well, it's Z and... It's Z and slash.
[48:28.44]That sound is fucking horrible.
[48:30.82]That's a sound I don't want to hear.
[48:34.88]You know what I'm saying?
[48:35.48]I don't like that sound at all.
[48:36.68]Everybody hates that sound.
[48:43.88]The ball is at like 9 FPS.
[48:48.27]Really?
[48:48.57]This whole thing is a slideshow of PNGs.
[49:00.43]There's no animation here.
[49:05.58]Where'd it go?
[49:06.38]Now you must open... Alright.
[49:14.19]Listen.
[49:15.85]When the Windows 95 space pinball machine is better than your pinball, that's a huge problem.
[49:26.47]That makes me just want to play that one.
[49:41.80]And that's... That's the Diablo II.
[49:44.86]I know I made a Diablo II reference yesterday.
[49:47.20]But this is all about references.
[49:48.60]These last two streams are just referencing anything I can reference.
[49:51.55]That's the patch.
[49:53.23]When you get a Diablo... Where's the ball?
[49:56.57]Did the ball go down?
[49:57.53]Was I not paying attention?
[50:01.63]Did it go through?
[50:09.82]Where is it?
[50:13.73]The ball is- now it is safe to turn off your monitor.
[50:29.12]That's scary.
[50:30.46]That's a scary piece of tech.
[50:31.64]Is there like a tilt?
[50:33.18]Don't some of these games have like a push or shove button?
[50:35.39]There it is, okay.
[50:43.12]What does it say?
[50:43.56]What does it say?
[50:44.00]I can't read it.
[50:45.94]You've been warned.
[50:47.40]The movie.
[50:48.53]What?
[50:49.67]You've been warned.
[50:51.03]What does it say?
[50:52.69]You've been warned.
[50:57.07]You've been gnomed.
[50:59.50]Move your mouse, but don't forget to play the game.
[51:04.80]I can't do anything.
[51:15.21]I want to see the other machine.
[51:26.33]I love that face so much.
[51:29.02]Alright, what's next?
[51:31.26]What do we have?
[51:32.00]What about this one?
[51:32.56]This is like Swampland.
[51:37.34]This one's an alligator.
[51:42.53]Is this one a higher... Move your mouse... I know, I know.
[51:45.87]Shut up.
[51:46.45]Shut up, guy.
[51:50.00]Cuckoo clock.
[51:51.64]Anyways.
[51:54.34]What I was saying before.
[51:56.14]If you spam the jermaOld emote enough times, it looks like... I'm just kidding.
[52:08.68]Does it give him a fart sound?
[52:11.80]Better.
[52:12.60]Yep, it does.
[52:13.90]I wanna get it in the alligator mouth.
[52:24.56]Get it in the alligator mouth, come on.
[52:26.98]What happened?
[52:32.79]What is going on?
[52:34.29]Hello?
[52:36.85]What is it, now what?
[52:38.80]Sorry, but it's your last Dan.
[52:44.17]What?
[52:44.45]I kicked it back into this?
[52:58.28]How?
[53:04.96]Oh, that was bullshit.
[53:06.82]It actually can give you a square ball.
[53:09.17]What?
[53:18.11]Uh, press escape.
[53:19.81]I'm out of here.
[53:25.70]That was atrocious.
[53:28.96]That was the worst game.
[53:30.78]I don't even care the ones that don't work.
[53:32.22]That was worse than the ones that don't work.
[53:38.15]I'm gonna keep the screen there for now.
[53:46.17]Mega pinball.
[53:52.03]Here we go.
[54:03.24]Make my desktop background tiles of the Snort Witch.
[54:08.92]Now that's gonna give me a headache.
[54:10.12]You don't think that'll give you a headache after like 20 minutes?
[54:16.74]Tuxedo level.
[54:17.74]I can't select the tuxedo.
[54:19.18]The tuxedo is unselectable.
[54:21.01]It's just there for flair and for fluff.
[54:28.71]Alright, so... Why do some of these not have percentages?
[54:34.51]Magic Spheres.
[54:42.24]Jerma can't even beat the first level of Starcraft.
[54:45.64]Um, yes I can.
[54:49.06]You start out, you're in the castle, and I gotta cleanse all the grain.
[54:55.93]The grain is all dirty and it's making people get the plague, so you gotta cleanse the people from the plague.
[55:03.05]The Culling of Stratholme.
[55:06.27]I remember that.
[55:06.85]It's the first level.
[55:07.71]I know it.
[55:13.59]That's not a WoW reference.
[55:15.25]That is a Warcraft reference.
[55:17.15]Not a World of Warcraft reference.
[55:19.05]It's a Warcraft reference.
[55:21.27]Alright, this one works.
[55:28.66]Always check.
[55:35.16]Are you fucking kidding me?
[55:36.04]It's the first game ever.
[55:37.16]Oh, and it's got full screen?
[55:38.74]Kidding me.
[55:39.80]Kidding me!
[55:50.13]You gotta be kidding me.
[55:51.13]Thank God.
[55:51.75]The only game in the goddamn pack that allows you to do this.
[56:04.96]And it's got sliders.
[56:06.76]It's got a gamma.
[56:08.26]Landscape quality.
[56:11.46]What is this even changing?
[56:18.28]I don't understand what that's doing.
[56:22.10]Fog type.
[56:22.90]Table or vertex?
[56:26.00]On some old video cards, table fog may look strange.
[56:28.90]Switching to vertex fog.
[56:35.81]Let's just render distance.
[56:37.71]Alright, we're ready.
[56:39.45]Welcome to Magic Spheres.
[56:42.11]I'm actually really excited for this.
[56:43.47]Start adventure.
[56:44.76]Screen saver.
[56:49.18]Level 1.
[56:49.84]I didn't do this.
[56:56.00]I don't like this.
[56:56.98]I don't like how this is doing this.
[56:58.06]This is fucking scaring me.
[57:03.91]This is the best game so far.
[57:08.13]Once upon a time, in the blessed country of Tyroding, good and evil locked horns in eternal combat.
[57:16.32]The evil wizard Catalyte stole and imprisoned, in fragile magical spheres, souls of the righteous.
[57:23.84]If they're not released before the Hour of the Wolf, the souls will become subjected to the mighty villain, and Tir-O-Ding will vanish into oblivion.
[57:32.89]There's only one sorcerer who's equal in strength to Karolite.
[57:36.82]Young Player!
[57:38.67]Luckily, Player dared to throw out a challenge to the Wicked Magician, and Carolite offered to play the game, in which souls are the tokens and the Tirrading is the game board.
[57:50.12]So be it.
[57:51.32]The battle will take place atop Squally Mountains, and the stake in the game is the future of our magical world.
[58:01.53]Oh, come on!
[58:02.45]No!
[58:02.83]What?
[58:03.77]No!
[58:04.15]Ah!
[58:06.36]It's a... It's this!
[58:08.02]It's a... I'm actually, like, upset about this.
[58:19.50]Such an epic journey we just went on.
[58:25.01]Are the Imprisoned Souls people that play Candy Crush every day and we have to, like, fucking take their iPads from them?
[58:35.30]This is what happens when you play Candy Crush for, like, fucking 12 hours a day and you spend, like, four grand on it.
[58:40.29]You turn into a cube.
[58:41.85]And then you have to get sucked up from a... a marble vacuum.
[58:58.84]You must release all souls before the timer... Alright, I can get this shit.
[59:05.84]Get a couple combos.
[59:08.84]Square to... This ain't a real match-free game.
[59:10.82]Square always works.
[59:11.70]And it turns into a fucking bomb.
[59:13.92]What have I got?
[59:17.12]I got it.
[59:39.20]That's its thermometer.
[59:40.18]That's how hot I was.
[59:43.80]Souls released.
[59:44.79]Click anywhere.
[59:46.53]For each level completed, you've received one upgrade point.
[59:49.79]You can spend it on upgrades.
[59:53.89]Click the plus button to purchase an upgrade to sell an upgrade and get upgrade points back.
[59:57.29]Click the minus button.
[60:00.33]This upgrade will allow up to five souls on the screen at one time.
[60:03.13]It's now only four.
[60:04.09]This is a skill tree.
[60:06.57]Low-level bonus.
[60:07.23]Make a row of four spheres to get this bonus.
[60:10.70]When activated, this bonus destroys nearby spheres.
[60:16.52]Yeah, that's what I was talking about.
[60:20.15]Well done!
[60:21.31]Don't forget that the stake in this game is the innocent souls.
[60:24.59]Break the spell of Karolite.
[60:26.69]The Earth is too small for magic.
[60:28.93]Karolite's black serpent and your white swan have soared skyward.
[60:33.99]The wizard has placed the first game board with souls above a peaceful meadow smelling of honey and white flowers.
[60:41.67]All that Great Britain dialog for this.
[60:49.43]Yeah, see, it makes a bomb.
[60:57.53]Yeah.
[60:58.53]Now this is what I'm talking about.
[60:59.59]Now the next time I do it, bingo.
[61:06.92]We got another row of four.
[61:08.38]Boom.
[61:08.92]Bomb.
[61:09.36]Explode.
[61:09.96]Bomb.
[61:10.34]Explode.
[61:10.78]Go ahead and do it to this one.
[61:13.49]Boom.
[61:23.39]Pretty good, huh?
[61:24.89]Let's see, let's see.
[61:32.90]How many souls do I have?
[61:38.10]I don't feel like I'm gonna play this one for a little while.
[61:42.35]This one's like fun.
[61:56.97]One of the Halos of the Souls.
[61:58.29]Okay, I need two more.
[62:00.17]Each successful move fills up your status bar.
[62:03.45]You need to fill the bar to activate perfect mode.
[62:07.28]Whatever.
[62:11.96]I need one insane strung together moment where I get like a hundred thousand points.
[62:32.42]I was... No, don't scream.
[62:34.28]Come on, you're too old for that.
[62:40.05]Got two minutes left?
[62:52.48]I'll check this out.
[62:53.32]Ready?
[62:58.56]I couldn't catch it?
[63:00.51]Alright.
[63:01.99]Oh, we're getting a double here.
[63:03.01]Watch this.
[63:03.43]Oh, I'm ready.
[63:04.11]I'm ready.
[63:04.43]I'm ready.
[63:04.73]I'm ready.
[63:05.07]Ready.
[63:05.27]Check it out.
[63:05.67]Ready.
[63:05.93]Bang.
[63:06.69]Bang.
[63:07.47]Bang.
[63:08.09]Oh, wait.
[63:08.93]Oof.
[63:36.52]Where's the halo?
[63:37.08]I need green down here.
[63:43.72]Come on.
[63:46.40]Come on, chat.
[63:47.32]Give me your energy.
[63:49.57]Watch this.
[63:50.15]Oh, 65 degrees Celsius.
[63:52.27]That's pretty cool.
[64:05.34]Lightning sequence, make rows of spheres of the same type one after another to activate a special effect.
[64:13.41]To get a high-level bonus, you have to make a row of five spheres.
[64:16.87]Yeah.
[64:19.13]Uh-huh.
[64:20.87]Blessed is your way, young wizard.
[64:22.80]Do one more good deed.
[64:24.00]Save 15 souls in prison here.
[64:31.18]Is this too loud?
[64:34.71]The 5.
[64:35.01]I remember the 5 makes like the rainbow sphere and it takes away all the same color.
[64:40.83]Yup.
[64:44.11]Yup.
[64:44.77]Look at all the great... What a terrible bonus.
[64:51.59]This shit's too loud.
[64:56.19]So don't fuck with that.
[64:59.42]I like this one.
[65:00.80]Alright.
[65:01.38]How many souls?
[65:02.18]15.
[65:02.20]15 souls is what we need.
[65:05.69]Oh my god.
[65:06.21]Okay, how many more do I need?
[65:12.53]15, 15, get it.
[65:13.08]You might, this might sound crazy, but I would pay like $1.50 for this one.
[65:22.46]Perfect mode!
[65:34.47]Come on, this is perfect mode!
[65:35.95]Holy shit!
[65:47.68]Dude!
[65:48.90]Dude!
[65:54.88]You paid 11 dollars for it.
[65:57.07]Yeah, but I'd pay a dollar like... I'd pay like two... Probably like six dollars for this one.
[66:10.61]How many more do I need?
[66:15.63]What do I have right now?
[66:21.16]I need that five in a row.
[66:24.96]It was worth it.
[66:25.52]It was worth it.
[66:26.34]Look, I'm telling you, I'm gonna get a cube one eventually here.
[66:30.58]Got it.
[66:36.98]You are what's wrong with kids today.
[66:41.52]What?
[66:42.56]Why?
[66:42.88]How could I be with... I'm playing like an old game.
[66:51.20]Alright, what's this one?
[66:54.65]Make a row of four to get this bonus.
[66:56.41]This is a row of four.
[66:58.49]No, wait.
[67:01.69]They're both rows, not columns.
[67:05.95]Mining sequence.
[67:09.33]Yeah.
[67:12.54]I think I want... hmm.
[67:15.88]Hmm.
[67:18.46]I want more spirits on the script.
[67:19.82]Why is this so in-depth?
[67:20.76]Do you want to take a break after this brilliant success?
[67:23.58]Draw a deep breath and continue.
[67:25.28]Twenty souls are waiting for you to release them.
[67:28.86]Even... people are getting mad if I don't finish this.
[67:30.80]Even though the mountains are snow-capped, the struggle for the innocent souls of the future of Tirroding becomes even hotter.
[67:38.05]Told you it was talk about how hot I was.
[67:42.16]Level 2-1.
[67:42.66]I'm gonna beat this game on stream.
[67:57.22]Please actually win this one.
[68:02.94]I actually beat this one?
[68:04.24]It's fun.
[68:05.52]I'm having a good time.
[68:09.19]It's such a simple game.
[68:11.73]Come on, come on, I need that perfect bonus.
[68:16.55]Did I fuck it up?
[68:17.14]Not yet, hold on.
[68:18.42]Oh wait, is it one, two, three, four?
[68:21.16]It's alright.
[68:23.30]Perfect bonus incoming.
[68:26.86]I'm gonna get a good one here.
[68:28.90]I need blue down here.
[68:31.42]Why is this so exciting?
[68:34.06]Uh-oh, uh-oh, I'm fine.
[68:43.21]Boom.
[68:51.02]Bomb.
[68:55.68]This way.
[69:00.20]I'll activate this.
[69:02.48]Check it out.
[69:03.74]Activate that.
[69:11.66]Fucking up the red one's bad.
[69:13.12]It's like, why don't I just play Bejeweled?
[69:22.72]That's like the good one.
[69:24.26]This one's good.
[69:24.74]Bejeweled doesn't have upgrade points.
[69:26.08]What am I talking about?
[69:31.50]That was a bad move.
[69:37.83]Bad move.
[69:49.59]Okay, I'm going to try to get rid of as many... I've got four more souls to free.
[69:58.84]Ah, I'm kind of getting over here.
[70:00.62]Right here.
[70:03.62]Five.
[70:04.00]Got it.
[70:05.67]Do it.
[70:10.41]Come on.
[70:10.89]Ah, I had an opportunity to do that.
[70:13.15]I'm just in perfect mode, so I'm freaking out.
[70:26.19]Just five, five, five, five, five.
[70:27.71]I need two more souls in a minute.
[70:37.67]Come on, let's do it.
[70:43.22]There it is, there it is, got it.
[70:46.34]Come on up, Great Point.
[70:56.96]Where's it going?
[70:58.76]Time shift.
[71:00.05]Two rows of spheres of the same type, one after another.
[71:02.61]That gives you 45 additional seconds.
[71:06.33]This is the... Make a row of four, this is the vertical one.
[71:10.87]Or do I want... Yeah, I want the vertical one.
[71:15.70]Vertical one's good.
[71:22.14]Anybody else find it funny that every single level going forward, the text gets smaller and smaller?
[71:30.76]That was a huge bunch of stuff to read, and then it's like, oh, and then a little bit of... One more problem to solve, but the villain is tireless, you need to release 25 souls.
[71:41.13]They had an elaborate... The problem over the snowy mountain caps and through the treacherous dirt.
[71:47.93]No, I don't care anymore.
[72:05.62]I like this one.
[72:06.88]I unironically think this game is fun.
[72:10.29]I really do.
[72:12.97]It's weird to say.
[72:14.87]Hmm, let me think about this.
[72:18.41]I got a minute.
[72:22.13]It's because you're a casual.
[72:29.81]Ah, this will be the last one.
[72:30.83]I'll do this one off stream.
[72:31.81]I'll play this one for like an hour.
[72:38.19]It's Candy Crush with upgrade codes.
[72:47.59]And here's the difference though.
[72:48.39]Candy Crush is a total horseshit video game.
[72:54.69]And all the iPad Match 3 games follow the same formula.
[72:57.91]And that formula is, the games are free to download, but after about 25 levels, the levels become nearly impossible to complete.
[73:08.98]unless you buy their little booster upgrades to blow up a row that you could not get before.
[73:14.24]So you have to spend like a dollar per little axe that you can knock one of the splots out with.
[73:24.51]And every level after that is the same way.
[73:39.26]Oh we're in perfect mode, hold on.
[73:48.07]Like anybody actually cares that we're in perfect mode right now.
[73:52.87]Like I'm gonna look over here and see everybody going like, oh nice, whoa, cool man.
[74:03.40]I'm missing so many, it's cause I started talking.
[74:20.16]Blow it up.
[74:23.54]That's a fiver right there.
[74:24.95]Oh, and it's a fiver into a four.
[74:32.31]Into another four.
[74:33.25]String it.
[74:39.02]Aww.
[74:49.00]Alright, let's see what the text is like this time.
[74:51.40]And I will move on after this one, alright.
[74:53.28]I got two upgrade points.
[75:05.75]My magic book says you'll need to liberate 30 souls, but don't forget to use the magic gift such as adding time.
[75:15.31]I have to stop.
[75:16.21]I have to stop doing this.
[75:19.56]Right?
[75:24.58]You have initiated... So, the same color.
[75:31.71]And then I get plus 1500.
[75:33.99]That's a lot of points.
[75:48.39]You have hundreds of games to play.
[75:50.35]That's true.
[75:51.19]We can't get addicted to one of these.
[75:52.87]What's this?
[75:54.07]What does it want me to do?
[75:56.83]How do you match this one?
[75:58.17]Match in between?
[75:58.71]I don't know.
[76:06.42]Alright, this will be the last.
[76:08.18]We do have another 150 games to play, so this will be the last one.
[76:12.50]That's it.
[76:13.44]One more.
[76:26.69]Time slow?
[76:28.55]Nice.
[76:30.11]There's a double angel here.
[76:32.95]Don't even, just don't worry about it.
[76:34.15]Just get what you need.
[76:35.21]Get what you need and get up.
[76:45.09]I need to get like a huge explosion where it's just like a string of like 30 things happening.
[77:01.88]Oh, he's close.
[77:07.65]Let's turn back to the team.
[77:14.13]Come on.
[77:16.93]Let's see it.
[77:17.55]Come on.
[77:21.95]No!
[77:22.11]That was supposed to go the other way.
[77:23.65]Damn it.
[77:25.09]What an idiot.
[77:36.54]Blew it again.
[77:37.08]No I didn't.
[77:37.64]That was perfectly thought out.
[77:39.14]God.
[77:39.28]GG.
[77:39.36]Why did I do that?
[77:40.40]We're never gonna get to see a crazy sequence, are we?
[78:08.02]That's all I care about.
[78:10.61]Just scratches my brain.
[78:11.91]Alright, we have four.
[78:24.08]Four into... Six more.
[78:29.40]Where are they?
[78:30.22]Two down here.
[78:32.36]Two blues.
[78:33.13]That should line it up nicely.
[78:34.39]That should line it up nicely.
[78:37.25]Eh, not really though, hold on.
[78:40.53]Oh, give me a big bonus.
[79:00.55]I blew it.
[79:05.19]He blew it.
[79:06.81]Did I though?
[79:15.92]They're down here.
[79:17.82]Just gotta bring some greys down there.
[79:19.36]And some yellows.
[79:21.62]And what, I got a minute?
[79:22.56]I got a minute to figure this out.
[79:24.00]Alright.
[79:56.86]Nice!
[79:57.14]More money!
[79:57.54]Alright.
[80:05.95]That's it.
[80:06.87]It isn't time to admire the scenery of 35 souls, but it's gonna keep going up.
[80:11.22]So this is it.
[80:11.76]That's it.
[80:14.84]This is the last one.
[80:26.06]Five.
[80:26.40]Got it.
[80:28.42]Come on.
[80:29.35]I gotta keep it stringing together.
[80:31.83]Five again.
[80:32.45]Got it again.
[80:32.95]Two fives on the board now.
[80:34.45]Two fives on the board, ladies and gentlemen.
[80:35.63]You see what's happening here?
[80:36.37]I'm queuing up like five fives.
[80:39.25]And it's gonna explode the whole thing and I can finally move on from this addiction.
[80:42.86]I can finally get out of here.
[80:49.24]One.
[80:50.34]Two.
[80:52.32]No.
[80:52.81]I fucked it up.
[80:59.04]doing this?
[81:02.22]ResidentSleeper.
[81:04.18]I know.
[81:04.86]Trust me.
[81:05.34]I'm very well aware of how ResidentSleeper, this is probably what I need to follow through.
[81:11.33]You guys see what's happening here?
[81:21.52]You guys see what's happening?
[81:22.44]Hmm.
[81:33.26]So many reds.
[81:33.90]Opportunity for five yellows right here.
[81:50.84]Got it.
[81:53.68]Alright, good.
[82:02.24]Had it before?
[82:03.38]What's up, man?
[82:06.99]Perfect mode activated.
[82:11.79]Oh, got it!
[82:28.72]Zeus is taking over my body right now.
[82:30.20]He's making all these plays.
[82:42.63]No, no, no, no, not yet, not yet, not yet, no, no, no.
[82:53.49]Come on, get... Ah!
[82:58.25]Let's get his mouth.
[83:04.73]I have to do it.
[83:05.45]I don't want it, but I have to get it.
[83:07.41]There we go.
[83:08.05]That's exactly what I'm looking for.
[83:20.48]I didn't even do the thing they wanted me to do.
[83:23.52]What's next?
[83:28.32]Up here.
[83:29.12]How many more?
[83:31.33]13 more?
[83:32.11]Double.
[83:54.08]No!
[83:54.64]I wanted that down there.
[83:55.54]Come on, give me it.
[84:03.01]Take a time bonus for sure.
[84:06.50]Take a double time bonus.
[84:10.14]No, I couldn't get it in time.
[84:28.49]Alright, I'll stop, I promise.
[84:31.13]After this, I'm done.
[84:47.82]Which one?
[84:48.22]This one?
[84:48.78]Yep.
[84:54.02]Ended on a good note.
[85:03.36]Do I even have any Halos?
[85:05.16]I don't.
[85:12.26]Where's the last Halo?
[85:13.16]It's over here.
[85:18.68]Complete the whole game.
[85:20.98]I can't do that.
[85:25.01]Why is it not ending?
[85:30.21]Oh, there we go.
[85:39.27]Alright, so... Your wisdom is years beyond your age.
[85:41.97]Use it to... Alright.
[85:44.65]I'm... It's a joke.
[85:45.51]I'm kidding.
[85:54.46]That was really good.
[85:55.16]That was really fun.
[85:58.28]It's the longest we spent in one the whole entire time.
[86:13.14]Oh, no.
[86:18.42]53, 54% of you guys are going up and down here.
[86:26.41]Gems of Amazon is currently in first place, but not by very much.
[86:35.37]Alright, what is that one over there?
[86:44.96]This is just another Match 3 game.
[86:47.90]Oh, I'm like... It's alright.
[86:56.97]Gems of the Amazon is on here twice.
[86:58.55]Okay, well here's Gems of the Amazon.
[87:08.40]Thank you for voting.
[87:16.48]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[87:19.60]Gems of the Amazon doesn't... Doesn't open.
[87:28.52]Saved.
[87:44.13]Click on the other one.
[87:50.43]I can't find it, too.
[87:53.69]Alright, let's try the other one.
[88:04.08]Gems of the Amazon.
[88:13.25]Also does not open.
[88:19.25]Both gems of the Amazon don't open.
[88:21.35]If you're going to have it on there twice, at least have one of them open.
[88:38.44]Will one of them work?
[88:44.98]Where the hell is it?
[88:45.67]Okay, I already got it.
[88:56.15]What is this one?
[88:56.71]I don't even know what you guys are looking at here.
[89:00.57]Something popper?
[89:04.67]35% for... Which one is that?
[89:09.83]That's teapot poppers.
[89:15.22]Let's give teapot poppers a try.
[89:28.78]Here we go.
[89:29.16]Let's see if I can fix the video settings.
[89:38.71]Yeah, this is teapot poppers.
[89:39.75]A lot of people have been waiting for this one.
[89:51.65]Holy fuck, this music.
[90:26.04]This is a regular Nintendo song.
[90:28.22]Let's try it.
[90:28.60]I'll restart it.
[90:31.42]That's Snake Rattle and Roll's theme song.
[90:33.40]I've said that like 12 times over the last seven years and it never is the case.
[90:43.02]Alright.
[90:43.70]Nice.
[90:45.28]We're good.
[90:46.42]And it opens in full screen.
[90:47.82]Would you look at that.
[90:55.08]Let's hear it.
[90:55.78]What's the music?
[90:56.70]Where's the sound?
[91:36.50]Oh, okay.
[91:39.03]Your cannon is near the camera, so you scan and shoot anywhere.
[91:45.11]Bounce your ball off of objects to reach balls that are otherwise inaccessible.
[91:48.23]This is just a snood, right?
[91:55.09]Buster balls, what's it called?
[92:02.13]Oh, this is just power-ups.
[92:09.92]What the hell am I looking at here?
[92:12.72]I don't know what you're eating, but it's definitely burnt.
[92:18.40]You left it in the oven for a little too long, I think.
[92:23.02]That may have been a casserole at one point.
[92:30.77]No, it is just Zuma.
[92:37.53]But that wasn't right.
[92:49.38]Oh, it's because the objects, this is not just... there for fun.
[92:55.00]Be careful, guys.
[93:05.41]These might start talking and singing songs about the house.
[93:10.12]Like, really, at least.
[93:40.49]Choo-choo-choo.
[94:36.77]I gotta get a string.
[94:38.37]Awesome!
[95:04.60]Failure.
[96:00.89]This is working.
[96:08.44]This music overlapping itself.
[96:32.82]No, no, no!
[96:34.72]No!
[96:37.28]Where we going?
[97:05.75]Cool.
[97:08.37]Frenzy.
[97:08.93]Oh, it's pretty even.
[97:22.83]What's up there?
[97:23.79]I don't know how to play Solitaire, so I'm going to veto that one.
[97:26.38]I can't veto all.
[97:27.22]I have to play all of them.
[97:29.10]Let me veto.
[97:37.23]So that is... Actually, it's kind of a fight between the two of them.
[97:44.89]Crystal Ice Quest or... Oh, Crystal Ice Quest is... No, it's not.
[97:48.84]What's going on here?
[97:50.56]Oh, it's because people can just spam click it.
[97:52.86]Sometimes it just makes that happen for some reason.
[97:57.26]Now, you can't do that.
[98:00.60]Go ahead and do it again.
[98:05.15]What do I do?
[98:05.57]Just click what you want.
[98:06.47]Yep.
[98:06.79]Just click the screen over a game that does not have an X on it that you would like to see.
[98:16.47]It's not working.
[98:18.33]You might have to activate or click on... It's an extension.
[98:22.71]So you might have to refresh the page.
[98:24.82]There's probably a button there that you can press on the screen.
[98:27.06]Maybe that's like, oh, he's got an extension going.
[98:30.36]Or you're on mobile.
[98:31.58]Oh.
[98:33.16]Oh.
[98:33.66]It probably doesn't work on mobile then.
[98:37.34]Alright, looks like we're gonna play a crystal ice quest.
[98:46.87]What are you linking to here?
[98:51.82]Yeah, what about it?
[98:52.86]What do you want me to do about this?
[98:58.16]See, now the real joke would be if you were to put that onto one of the witches' faces.
[99:12.76]I mean, that would have been... Well, that's what I would have done.
[99:16.86]Anyways, let's go ahead and move back over here.
[99:21.55]So we're going to go... What was it?
[99:23.93]Ice?
[99:24.15]Crystal ice?
[99:28.11]This one is in its own window.
[99:29.51]Thank God.
[99:35.46]I'm not touching any of these.
[99:45.48]Get it in a better spot for you to actually see what's going on.
[99:51.25]Sound volume too high.
[99:53.65]Alright, let's play.
[100:02.42]Why does it stop here?
[100:09.38]You have such a huge map.
[100:10.50]This is it?
[100:11.26]Click the link.
[100:12.68]Click the link.
[100:14.20]Click the link.
[100:16.46]Hold on, that needs to... Alright, let's take a look.
[100:43.57]Oh my god.
[100:44.35]That was fast.
[100:46.75]Alright, level one, crab.
[100:47.96]Sounds good.
[100:53.20]I don't want to play this.
[100:54.26]It's too much for my brain.
[100:54.96]I already don't think I know how to do this.
[100:56.48]Move a piece of ice using the left mouse button.
[100:59.16]Use the right mouse button for rotation.
[101:01.80]Throw unnecessary pieces of ice into the fire.
[101:04.84]You can light the fire by using wood.
[101:07.12]Each amplification reduces time of flaming up by 20%.
[101:09.70]When the water is filled with pieces of ice, you lose the level.
[101:14.95]Bonus purchasing.
[101:15.79]Left click to bonus purchase.
[101:18.05]Press to make the next piece of ice appear.
[101:22.13]Sure I...
[101:29.48]Disaster has fallen upon the inhabitants of tropical islands everywhere.
[101:32.84]A relentless frost has crept over everything.
[101:36.46]Palm trees are iced over.
[101:37.90]Fish are frozen solid in the seas.
[101:40.24]Birds cannot take flight.
[101:41.92]The Snow King has chosen a new location for the capital of his icy domain.
[101:46.99]Only he and some penguins are happy about the frozen wasteland the world has become.
[101:51.99]But fire still burns on your island.
[101:54.75]You still have a glimmer of hope in your heart.
[101:57.81]To return life to these once blessed places, reach the palace of the Snow King.
[102:03.55]Rotate a piece of ice in the right mouse button and insert it into the grid.
[102:19.87]What the fuck are you talking about?
[102:21.63]Oh.
[102:24.15]Oh no, this is gonna take extra brain power.
[102:27.32]This piece of ice contains a bonus fish.
[102:33.74]Okay.
[102:35.27]I got a fish.
[103:03.13]No, I got it.
[103:10.17]Press for use of the exempted bonus animal.
[103:13.71]What the fuck are you talking to me for?
[103:16.76]Putterfish.
[103:17.80]Click.
[103:18.10]Game crashed.
[103:20.38]No, it didn't.
[103:21.28]I couldn't even read it.
[103:21.92]What did it say?
[103:26.96]What did it say?
[103:28.33]I don't know.
[103:28.67]I have no idea.
[103:34.09]Nope.
[103:46.46]Oh my god, that's all it does?
[103:48.74]What a piece of shit.
[103:55.34]You can throw unnecessary pieces into the fire.
[103:58.56]Oh, the fire's gone now, though.
[104:00.99]I think I lost.
[104:01.63]I think I lose.
[104:05.41]I've only done diamonds over here.
[104:06.89]I haven't done anything else.
[104:08.19]Oh, shit.
[104:09.57]Uh-oh.
[104:10.01]Where are the other pieces?
[104:11.51]Come on.
[104:34.45]Give me one more piece.
[104:35.33]Burn it in the fire, and that's a perfect score.
[104:45.75]Oh.
[104:49.41]Level two is turtle.
[104:51.99]Okay, this fills a grid, adds extra points.
[104:54.51]I can't sit here and read that.
[105:01.20]What?
[105:01.38]What does a snail do?
[105:02.42]Slows down time.
[105:03.66]Oh, now they're introducing different pieces.
[105:07.20]No, I gotta save these.
[105:09.08]Nope.
[105:09.89]No.
[105:10.67]Nope.
[105:13.85]See what I mean?
[105:20.35]Those have to go in here.
[105:21.45]Fuck.
[105:47.51]None of these are ever going to fit ever again.
[105:50.75]Press to make the next piece of ice appear.
[105:52.47]Why would I do that when I'm already so far behind?
[105:54.55]Oops, I fucked that one up.
[106:43.47]This one's fun.
[106:46.53]I actually truly believe this one's fun.
[106:49.69]What did I do that for?
[106:50.37]That was such a not funny fucking thing to do.
[106:52.24]Get it all in one go before they all fall in the fucking water!
[106:55.42]All in one go!
[107:02.38]Watch this.
[107:08.99]It's my attempt.
[107:12.43]Ready?
[107:52.10]I don't like the individual pieces.
[107:56.74]It hurts to try to do them one at a time like that.
[107:59.19]Why did I do them like that?
[108:00.27]Alright, we're good.
[108:50.30]I'm gonna throw up.
[108:52.25]I might.
[108:52.61]I'm gonna slow down.
[109:23.84]Uh-oh.
[109:26.12]We can do that more than once.
[109:30.26]I didn't know what it was doing.
[109:31.06]Alright.
[109:47.35]How do I let go of this?
[110:07.35]I'm not gonna lose, I'm fine.
[110:08.75]Alright, this one's fun, but I gotta, you know, I gotta move on.
[110:17.78]That was interesting.
[110:18.58]This game is actually cool.
[110:22.04]It's interesting.
[110:23.32]What are the only interesting mechanics?
[110:28.58]All these new pieces to bring in.
[110:30.50]What a cool game.
[110:35.48]I fucked it up.
[110:40.69]That was interesting.
[110:41.27]What was that one called?
[110:41.91]That was called Crystal Ice Quest.
[110:48.93]Drop that one down if you want to play it.
[110:50.17]Alright, let's keep going.
[111:05.95]Alright, I gotta pee.
[111:10.33]Every time the stream has been up for two hours, I have to pee.
[111:14.42]I need to get a urinal in this room and just mute the microphone and just go piss into the wall.
[111:21.14]I wonder, okay, if I ever had a million dollars, I would install a urinal in the closet behind me.
[111:29.90]Think about that.
[111:30.62]Think about how easy that would be.
[111:33.16]So we're gonna play solitaire, it looks like.
[111:35.00]So, thanks for the votes.
[111:37.72]But, honest to God, right?
[111:40.42]Imagine if there was, in that closet right there, there was just a urinal.
[111:44.74]And I could just slide it open and just go in there and just, the whole back wall would just be porcelain.
[111:50.75]And just, all the way down.
[111:52.05]And a giant drain in the bottom.
[111:53.21]And I could just piss directly into the back of the closet.
[111:55.45]It would be great.
[111:59.06]Or just the floor.
[112:01.73]If right here underneath me was just porcelain and just a- there was a drain.
[112:07.17]I think we've already said this before.
[112:10.87]Yeah, we have.
[112:11.77]We have talked about this.
[112:13.88]Imagine you could just piss directly into your floor and it would just go down into your plumbing.
[112:23.44]Who wants to get up and walk down the stairs?
[112:35.76]That's revolting?
[112:36.54]Please stop.
[112:37.14]What is revolting about going P?
[112:43.48]That's revolting?
[112:48.30]P is revolting.
[112:52.93]Alright, solitaire it is.
[112:55.43]Spider, gold, solitaire.
[112:56.97]This is going to be fun because I don't have any idea how to play this.
[113:00.97]I don't know how to play solitaire.
[113:02.01]Solitaire.
[113:04.96]Not a single clue.
[113:12.35]This image is fucking going to haunt me.
[113:18.77]And it doesn't even matter because Solitaire does not open.
[113:22.27]So we get to save ourselves about 15 straight minutes of me clicking on random cards and asking if I'm doing it right.
[113:31.64]And just for the sake of everyone thinks, well, he's a liar, we've got a liar here.
[113:37.50]Solitaire gold.
[113:39.37]Click.
[113:40.85]You see the spinning wheel?
[113:45.21]I don't see it anymore.
[113:46.33]We don't got a game.
[113:48.21]No game.
[113:55.11]Still a liar.
[113:59.45]We just cover that up.
[114:03.81]And go again.
[114:05.59]I will see you guys in two seconds.
[114:07.31]I'm just going to go pee into my closet directly into the back of the porcelain wall.
[114:12.28]And please vote for something that you'd like to see.
[114:14.84]Be right back.
[116:29.58]That's a nice traffic light.
[116:34.22]Is this streamer's choice?
[116:35.42]It must be.
[116:48.02]That's just a train symbol thing.
[116:51.59]The train sign.
[116:52.79]Like, there's a train here.
[116:53.95]Railroad crossing.
[116:56.77]I think that's what that is.
[116:58.94]Alright, so I'm going to play because... because people don't want to have anything besides a long shape with two circles on the ends of it.
[117:13.27]Not everything we draw is a dick.
[117:14.65]Are you sure about that?
[117:15.99]To me, this looks like... It looks like people were drawing a very long shape and then other people came in to try to save this
[117:30.85]That's what I think happened.
[117:34.83]What kind of a dick has six balls?
[117:39.64]You know what?
[117:39.96]How about we just move on from this topic?
[117:42.48]And I'm going to play the Pyramid of Gold.
[117:51.04]Now it's a train.
[117:54.02]Good job.
[117:54.50]This is solitaire.
[117:56.30]This is pyramid solitaire.
[118:00.57]Alright, let's see if it opens.
[118:18.45]No.
[118:26.55]Oh, well.
[118:29.06]Alright, it's time for streamer's choice.
[118:32.34]I want to play the pinball game up there.
[118:37.29]Ace's Pinball Wacky Worlds.
[118:40.47]Streamer's choice.
[118:59.97]It opens.
[119:04.33]This is really bright and painful.
[119:10.67]This hurts.
[119:11.22]Oh, Jeremy, we know your name.
[119:30.93]We just have to reset its transformation.
[119:35.87]And just go like this.
[119:38.23]That looks good.
[119:39.07]This is way too loud.
[119:48.18]Sorry I'm punching you guys in the face.
[119:50.50]Sorry.
[120:02.43]Alright, so this is scores, help, options.
[120:04.47]Let's just start.
[120:05.23]It's pinball.
[120:09.62]How is this pinball?
[120:14.60]Oh, it's one of these.
[120:15.42]I just won.
[120:16.98]That ball is never coming back down here.
[120:27.17]Where is the ball?
[120:27.95]Look, do you see this?
[120:28.77]Which...
[120:34.72]This is too many balls.
[120:42.02]This is too distracting, so it's this one.
[120:45.32]Turma's ball is red.
[120:48.90]Huh?
[121:07.39]Seriously, in a game where you have to catch the ball, having all these other tiny balls drop at the same time is just very distracting.
[121:18.45]I hate it.
[121:24.51]Multi-ball.
[121:44.92]I got it.
[121:45.32]I got them both at the same time.
[121:47.13]Fuck.
[122:00.05]Thumbs up?
[122:02.67]Hey, if you like what you see, give the channel a fucking 4 out of 10.
[122:13.07]This is kind of cool.
[122:13.71]We got a picture up back there.
[122:19.87]This is cool.
[122:21.00]It's not, but it is.
[122:22.42]It's alright.
[122:24.98]You get rid of these falling down crystal ball things, and I think you got yourself a pretty solid breakout type game.
[122:38.77]This is where I get a shine here.
[122:39.69]Oh.
[122:42.49]Never mind.
[122:43.53]I got a bad one.
[122:51.72]All those lemons.
[122:52.94]Wasted.
[123:10.15]Small ball.
[123:18.58]I've been holding on to this for days.
[123:21.94]It's been like three days, two days.
[123:23.12]Remember when I was going to speak?
[123:25.71]Oh, thank god!
[123:28.07]That's been trying to happen for like two straight days.
[123:30.41]I feel so much better.
[123:40.01]If you watched the stream yesterday, that's tried to happen twice, three, four times during that stream.
[123:45.85]Man.
[123:47.21]That felt great.
[123:50.53]That was fun.
[124:00.37]I just don't want to sit there and play it.
[124:20.04]What was that?
[124:20.90]That was a streamer's choice.
[124:24.32]That was a wacky pinball.
[124:35.71]So we got another Solitaire game.
[124:37.61]I hope it doesn't open.
[124:44.54]We'll find out.
[124:45.80]This is Klondike Solitaire.
[124:54.03]I don't think any of the Solitaire games are going to open.
[124:57.55]Nope.
[125:06.37]None of them.
[125:06.97]Might as well just get them out of the way now.
[125:08.15]Because they're not going to open.
[125:16.79]What would you do to play Klondike Solitaire?
[125:20.25]Would you quack like a duck?
[125:21.95]No.
[125:23.03]Are you sure?
[125:24.35]What about the delicious chocolate crispy filling?
[125:27.35]I don't know about that.
[125:29.19]Would you bark like a dog?
[125:32.98]God, those commercials made me fucking...
[125:43.69]Go watch the Klondike Bar commercials and just be like, damn, I wouldn't do that for a fucking 39 cent brick of ice cream.
[125:51.85]Alright, cover that one up.
[126:06.98]What would you do for a Klondike Bar?
[126:17.63]Where is it?
[126:30.18]I know.
[126:30.50]Last stream I covered this up.
[126:31.94]I know.
[126:32.90]It's a joke.
[126:35.18]Where are we going?
[126:42.51]Solitaire.
[126:43.69]Alright.
[126:44.43]Solitaire dozen gold.
[126:45.75]I'm clicking it.
[126:47.82]It's not opening.
[126:49.04]None of the Solitaire games work.
[126:51.14]We might as well just skip them all.
[126:53.66]Nope, it doesn't open.
[126:54.64]I just clicked it out of... No.
[126:58.20]Try again.
[127:01.04]Liar.
[127:01.73]Liar.
[127:05.29]Solitaire doesn't gold.
[127:09.47]Look.
[127:10.57]Nothing.
[127:11.65]None of them are going to open.
[127:23.41]It's because I've run, I've, I've, don't, listen.
[127:26.59]I've run as administrator, the whole thing is running as administrator, and when I go in and do administrator and compatibility, it does the same thing.
[127:33.53]And force it into 640x480, and take away the DPI settings, and reduce arrow, and all of it.
[127:52.21]What is that one?
[127:54.07]Fairy Tale Quest.
[128:02.76]Fairy Tale Quest.
[128:05.40]Let's see how bad this one smells.
[128:09.00]Thank you for voting.
[128:09.52]Let's give it a go.
[128:17.25]Fairy Tale Quest.
[128:21.61]It opens.
[128:23.54]Hooray.
[128:25.58]But... Okay, it is.
[128:26.85]It's gonna be a match-three game, isn't it?
[128:31.61]Did I do that?
[128:33.03]I... I don't know if I did that.
[128:35.65]I maybe...
[128:51.75]No, okay, okay, hold on.
[128:53.19]No, I know what's going on here.
[128:54.91]No, I don't.
[128:55.41]Okay, adventure.
[128:56.84]Wait, let me fix this.
[129:21.54]Interesting.
[129:22.14]Alright, we start here.
[129:23.02]Do I get to read something at that?
[129:26.17]Medieval fantasy voice that I do all the time.
[129:30.25]No, I don't.
[129:30.81]I don't even get to do that.
[129:36.71]Rotate chips to combine three or more bottles.
[129:39.38]Yeah.
[129:43.30]To turn the game board clockwise, click the right of the board.
[129:47.18]Oh no.
[129:47.66]I don't like this.
[130:00.89]Yo, you have to open the... Yo, you gotta open the chests.
[130:04.90]Okay.
[130:05.30]To beat the level, you must open all trunks.
[130:08.52]Okay.
[130:08.86]Find four bottles in a line to get the Viking destroying this line.
[130:14.02]Gotta get this one down, here.
[130:54.26]Holy fuck.
[130:55.20]Oh, wait a minute.
[130:56.43]There's five here.
[130:57.49]Holy God.
[130:57.97]Do your own sound effects.
[130:59.33]Again.
[130:59.79]You want me to do that?
[131:01.69]Again.
[131:02.55]I need the music at least.
[131:24.77]Okay.
[131:25.01]Well, I don't know where to go.
[131:26.41]Ding!
[131:26.69]That delayed sound?
[131:27.71]What the fuck was that?
[131:28.37]The game, like, fucked up?
[132:00.72]That one goes too fast.
[132:07.98]I can't do that.
[132:14.54]What was this one?
[132:17.45]Adventure or something?
[132:18.67]Fairytale adventure?
[132:21.59]There it is.
[132:29.78]Go on.
[132:31.38]Go on.
[132:38.09]You guys just going through all the ones that have quest in the title?
[132:42.53]No, that's the same one.
[132:44.59]That's the same one.
[132:45.67]They just put it there twice.
[132:51.35]Why is it here twice?
[132:54.62]I hope it doesn't open.
[133:00.52]No, it's the same thing.
[133:01.22]It opened again.
[133:01.68]It's fine.
[133:02.44]Here it is.
[133:06.54]It's not a different game.
[133:12.95]But here's the crazy part.
[133:14.77]If it is a separate game with a separate folder, why would it still have J here?
[133:26.98]I just opened it up again from where I just was.
[133:36.31]Because it reads your system name.
[133:37.68]My system name is not Jay.
[133:39.89]It's Jeremy.
[134:00.04]No, my system name is not Jeremy.
[134:01.56]My system name is Ymarage.
[134:04.16]Because it's Jeremy backwards and nobody would know that it was me.
[134:13.76]You have to move the key.
[134:28.27]Why would I even begin?
[134:29.44]It's the same thing we just did.
[134:39.16]Restart, let's go.
[134:53.49]Are you making fun of my username?
[134:57.08]Your marriage, or should I say Jeremy?
[135:07.34]Fast food.
[135:08.34]I wonder what this one's gonna be about.
[135:12.87]Fast food mania.
[135:14.59]It's got french fries on it.
[135:15.91]This one looks kind of fun.
[135:19.87]It is one of those games that's stuffed in the corner at 640 by 480 though.
[135:27.66]This one could be pretty good.
[135:32.16]Let's hope there's a... Yep, there is a window log.
[135:35.81]So that's good.
[135:37.55]Right off the bat.
[135:43.11]What the fuck are you doing?
[135:49.43]I can't see where it is.
[135:51.63]You're gonna minimize when I do this?
[135:53.09]Okay.
[135:56.57]back here!
[135:57.05]For the love of fucking god.
[136:09.34]It's scared.
[136:12.08]It's just running away.
[136:13.04]Alright, hold on, almost there.
[136:17.65]That's as good as it's gonna get, I'm sorry, I'm not doing that anymore.
[136:27.98]Looks good.
[136:29.44]Play game.
[136:31.08]Do you want to continue your last game that you've never started?
[136:33.58]1, 6.
[136:33.62]I can start on 6.
[136:38.90]1, 6, or 11?
[136:39.66]Why would you be able to do this?
[136:43.55]Start.
[136:44.07]Start on 1.
[136:48.81]Greenville.
[136:50.49]Day one.
[136:51.80]Today is my last day of high school.
[136:53.58]Finally, my life can begin.
[136:55.30]College, new friends, a great job.
[136:57.30]Life's going to be good.
[136:59.40]Day two.
[137:00.68]Unbelievable.
[137:01.60]My parents spent my college fund on their new business.
[137:05.98]The girl of my dreams, Nancy, had agreed to go with me to our graduation party, but now she's with Daryl.
[137:13.79]Zeal upstart.
[137:15.19]Life is over.
[137:16.19]Goodbye, dreams.
[137:21.18]In one day, this happens.
[137:24.35]What a fucking journal.
[137:27.95]Not even 24 hours go by.
[137:29.61]Alright, you can't even have that be day like 7 or 8 or like day 4.
[137:44.26]You can't have like this progress.
[137:48.04]Oh my god.
[137:50.43]Okay, it is.
[137:51.21]Day's free.
[137:52.69]I need money, but what can I do to earn it?
[137:55.78]Next day.
[137:56.92]I'll work for a delivery service.
[137:58.36]The most important thing is for me to work fast and stay alert.
[138:01.26]Plus, if I do a good job, the boss will pay me extra.
[138:08.88]No.
[138:11.38]It's not a match 3 game.
[138:12.60]Click on the product.
[138:15.09]Click on the order.
[138:21.63]This is horrendous.
[138:27.29]This is barely a video game.
[138:34.74]I need to see how the story plays out, though.
[138:36.18]Don't you guys wanna know?
[138:48.38]I mean, when does it end?
[138:53.64]I need to, hold on a minute.
[138:54.86]First of all, this, I got a really important question for you guys.
[138:59.87]Does this guy make, does this guy make $2400 in one day?
[139:04.05]Why are there aliens invaded?
[139:13.34]What does that have to do with anything?
[139:15.40]I just made $4100.
[139:27.12]Okay.
[139:28.47]On day five, I buckled down and worked hard.
[139:30.51]Today I learned that if I deliver several orders of the same kind in a row, I'll be paid extra.
[139:36.25]Deliver several orders of the same kind in a row to earn extra money.
[139:39.97]I did that, right?
[139:54.27]You can queue them up.
[139:59.12]Shit.
[140:00.42]That pop- that was like a fucking troll pop-up.
[140:11.29]Do aliens invade every day?
[140:15.67]That's the real question.
[140:17.63]That we should be having.
[140:21.62]That person gave me a $2200 tip.
[140:22.72]Holy shit.
[140:37.54]It's 10 grand in one day.
[140:41.40]Delivering donuts.
[140:45.83]And for my night job, I'm part of the Earth Defense Force.
[140:50.91]We're not getting any more lore?
[140:59.99]600 bucks.
[141:04.62]Just wait till there's french fries.
[141:05.64]Who cares?
[141:07.98]Oh, you have... French fries?
[141:19.95]Nah.
[141:24.61]That's a donut double.
[141:32.72]No, no, yeah.
[141:35.16]Not looking for donuts.
[141:44.44]I really don't get the UFO thing, but I'll get it 100% every time.
[141:53.47]This is more fun than the actual video game.
[142:02.14]So I made 20 grand in four days.
[142:04.06]Here we go.
[142:05.34]Day six.
[142:05.96]Our mechanic says he could upgrade my truck so it could go faster for short periods of time, but he needs money for the improvements.
[142:11.00]Okay.
[142:12.98]Speed up.
[142:15.04]That's four grand.
[142:22.08]I know how to make my truck faster.
[142:24.35]Click on the bonus icon to activate it.
[142:30.95]Oh, geez.
[142:38.81]Come on.
[142:40.89]Got it.
[142:42.09]Come on.
[142:43.07]What?
[142:51.45]I hate this.
[142:56.43]You guys could still click on the screen that whole time.
[143:03.69]I mean, that was just getting to be kind of mind-numbingly painful.
[143:08.82]But what happened?
[143:09.62]What happened is I played the game for another three or four levels in a row and made like a hundred thousand dollars.
[143:20.72]and then did everything that I wanted to do.
[143:33.11]What is that one?
[143:37.53]Montezuma's Quest.
[143:44.80]We can't click on the last row.
[143:47.52]Yeah, I know.
[143:48.44]You can't click on the top row either.
[143:49.94]I wonder why.
[143:50.72]Is it really a surprise that the top and bottom row is pretty open?
[144:03.55]We're gonna have to just do them in a row.
[144:06.55]Alright, Montezuma's Quest.
[144:09.31]Let's take a look.
[144:15.77]What up, what up, what up, Jerma?
[144:17.03]Hey, what up?
[144:20.49]Is it going to be Zuma?
[144:21.49]It probably will be.
[144:23.97]Loud.
[144:24.63]Keep in mind here, this is widescreen.
[144:57.53]Alt-F4.
[144:58.09]What kind of game encourages Alt-F4?
[145:00.69]Alright, instructions.
[145:04.61]Yes.
[145:04.85]Oh, God.
[145:05.83]I don't want to read this.
[145:24.06]They have their one piece of lore and then the game starts and then it's just a match three game.
[145:28.92]Oh, I missed it.
[145:30.02]Just pretend like I read it.
[145:30.87]Oh, go back.
[145:31.53]Can I go back?
[145:44.47]Archaeological Museum, Cancun, Mexico, 1935.
[145:48.91]Graduate student Emily Jones didn't know what she was getting into when she accepted a summer position at the catalog exhibits at the Archaeological Museum in Cancun.
[145:57.70]But her job provided an opportunity to study some of the most amazing artifacts of the ancient cultures that have resided in the land known now as Mexico.
[146:05.56]While elbow-deep in dull paperwork, she was drawn to a mysterious stone, her edifice in the center of the museum's library.
[146:12.07]Ancient notes, penned by a Spanish monk who had served as a missionary to the Aztec tribe, mentioned a similar structure.
[146:20.08]He claimed it was a map pointing out to a secret Aztec city.
[146:24.26]Numerous legends said that the city was resting place of Montezuma's calendar, a supernatural relic that granted its possessor a long life.
[146:32.70]The monk's notes said that sunstones that could be acquired in a game of Magic Threes would show up on your iPad on a week-to-week basis, at least ten of them a week.
[146:43.01]But the stone construction bore no instructions for playing the game.
[146:46.27]Undaunted, Miss Jones searched for the museum for clues to eventually find a dusty box of colored tokens in a forgotten corner of the repository.
[146:54.48]Noting that some of the tokens were adorned with gems, the young woman began stealing them and got real rich real real fucking quick, as each one of those gems was worth about 250,000 pounds.
[147:06.97]When she found the correct order, the tokens disappeared though, leaving the gems behind.
[147:10.73]Even more incredible new tokens appeared in their place.
[147:56.44]What is it?
[147:59.78]I can't sit there.
[148:01.09]If it's the same thing we did before, it's like a waste of time at that point.
[148:16.40]That's a waste of time.
[148:18.76]To sit there and play.
[148:19.92]I found the good one, which was the bubblegum crystal ball one.
[148:25.55]Now we're going to the hidden object collection.
[148:30.07]I'm going to laugh my ass off if this is just all of them that are in the game that are on the disk in one spot.
[148:37.75]Let's find out.
[148:57.66]That's not doing anything.
[148:58.70]Pirates, Egypt, zoo, haunted.
[149:01.12]Let's see if we can find the witch.
[149:05.08]That's all that matters.
[149:06.16]Where's the witch?
[149:07.16]That doesn't count.
[149:40.96]There she is.
[149:41.78]Where?
[149:42.06]That's great.
[149:51.55]The people that are actually playing the game.
[149:54.43]That's not the witch.
[149:55.23]How is that face not a witch?
[150:00.43]It might be.
[150:13.44]That's not the witch either.
[150:15.96]Can somebody find the vase, please?
[150:18.06]Don't worry.
[150:19.26]Okay, now what?
[150:22.75]That's it.
[150:23.37]How do you end the game?
[150:39.02]That's it.
[150:42.84]Oh, there's a more button.
[150:45.28]Alright, we need a mug and a roll.
[150:47.88]Anybody see a mug?
[150:52.45]Looking for a mug and a roll.
[150:57.37]Yeah, this mug doesn't work.
[151:03.53]That's a squash.
[151:05.50]That's a hamburger.
[151:08.71]That's a- that's a noose.
[151:15.99]No.
[151:16.17]No, that's- that's a foot.
[151:19.63]I don't even know what I clicked on.
[151:26.59]Mug.
[151:26.97]Where's roll?
[151:28.33]You found all the items.
[151:37.43]Well.
[151:38.68]It's just this one spot.
[151:41.40]That's unbelievable.
[151:42.30]Okay.
[151:42.59]Well, what else?
[151:43.93]Okay, what do you want to do now?
[151:45.55]We're only doing one more of these.
[151:46.63]I'm not opening all of them.
[151:48.25]Pirates?
[151:48.71]Click the X!
[151:49.51]No, we're doing pirates.
[152:08.46]Can you get it?
[152:11.40]It's the same song too.
[152:13.12]Oh, it's... Ugh.
[152:16.07]These are all wrong.
[152:39.12]What are you clicking on here?
[152:41.26]Why is everybody... A bunch of... What's with the parrot?
[152:43.62]Fish?
[152:43.72]You got a spider on your screen.
[152:50.62]Alright, that was fun.
[153:10.49]No, no, we didn't finish it!
[153:13.05]No, no, no!
[153:39.33]Imagine this is what the zoo looked like.
[153:41.33]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[153:43.96]Hold on, before anybody does anything, look at how fucked up this is.
[153:48.72]This is the zoo when all the cages get let open.
[153:53.14]You're not going here.
[153:54.02]Imagine how fucking dangerous and horrible this is.
[153:57.64]It's like centipedes.
[154:05.51]The entrance to the zoo is right there.
[154:10.72]They're all already escaped.
[154:16.40]They have a fence.
[154:17.91]Oh, yeah?
[154:19.13]Mr. Alligator and Mr. Elephant have a lot to say to you about that.
[154:24.75]And the elephant, by the way, is carrying a giraffe inside of this basket and a cat and a megaphone.
[154:33.40]And there's a tuba.
[154:34.78]Where is the tuba?
[154:36.06]There's the tuba.
[154:38.36]They're like, tennis racket.
[154:39.18]This is...
[154:41.39]This is the people that they've eaten.
[154:42.57]You know, like a band came in here.
[154:47.81]Some lawyer.
[154:49.31]A witch was here.
[154:50.05]A farmer.
[154:52.17]These are all people that have been eaten.
[154:53.91]Were killed here.
[155:04.12]They even brought the witch in.
[155:07.28]The witch couldn't do shit.
[155:11.70]Alright, go ahead and figure out where you want to go.
[155:16.30]Come on down to the zoo.
[155:18.74]Alright.
[155:19.80]Click cat, I did.
[155:21.56]There's nothing up here.
[155:42.02]with a banana.
[155:46.68]The music is so loud.
[155:50.46]Hold on, I need to fix that.
[155:53.26]No, no, no, no, no, I don't.
[156:12.02]Get a hint.
[156:16.28]What did the hint do?
[156:18.52]Hint.
[156:20.21]Rush.
[156:20.75]Help.
[156:20.99]Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey.
[156:24.45]What?
[156:24.95]What?
[156:49.31]The thing that I- I can't- there's nothing here.
[156:56.41]There's a piece of wire or there's a hose over here.
[157:13.89]Oh.
[157:14.69]Right.
[157:15.27]Okay.
[157:19.14]I get it.
[157:20.72]I understand.
[157:24.75]That was hidden objects for fun.
[157:36.23]No, we don't have to finish it.
[157:38.71]Finishing it is not necessary.
[157:43.33]Did you have fun, you?
[157:51.32]Those of you that are curious, after we pick this out, it looks like, I'm not sure, is that Builder Bob or is that Adventure Tales?
[158:06.95]Probably Bob.
[158:10.43]Okay, it's Bob.
[158:14.78]So those of you that are curious, we have this and all the X's are on it.
[158:21.61]There's also these.
[158:31.33]There is this one.
[158:33.97]Builder Bob incoming.
[158:36.74]If it opens.
[158:37.94]That is.
[158:41.90]Builder Bob.
[158:42.82]Builder Bob.
[158:43.72]Builder Bob.
[158:44.74]Where is it?
[158:47.80]It should be the right one.
[158:50.60]There it is.
[158:51.26]It's Bulldozer Bob, not Builder Bob.
[158:56.10]No, that's... Alright, come on!
[159:01.27]Open!
[159:04.23]Nice.
[159:07.50]Oh my god, this looks terrible.
[159:22.76]I feel like my video card in my computer is just in physical pain right now.
[159:34.25]The amount of resolution changes that my computer's had to go through.
[159:36.95]Version 3.5.
[159:49.82]The best version, from my understanding.
[159:53.28]Alright, Bulldozer Bob.
[159:54.98]Your terrible, crackling audio needs to be reduced.
[160:00.17]It's alright.
[160:00.75]Game speed, that's fine.
[160:02.69]Start.
[160:03.77]Classic, Advanced, or Metal Pack?
[160:08.92]Metal Pack.
[160:09.72]This is gonna be a Pac-Man clone.
[160:12.18]No, it's not.
[160:21.73]So don't collect the bags of money.
[160:23.43]The bags of money kill you.
[160:28.32]I don't... I've never... In what game does that happen?
[160:35.50]The bags of money are too heavy.
[160:38.60]So I have to collect the bags after I crush them on the ground.
[160:56.65]Did he just take the money?
[160:58.07]He just took the money.
[161:00.03]I didn't know they could steal the money.
[161:04.05]That's kind of bullshit.
[161:08.91]Come back down.
[161:10.11]Right here.
[161:11.31]Up.
[161:11.89]Up.
[161:12.87]Up.
[161:14.19]Up.
[161:14.91]No.
[161:15.29]Don't come over this way.
[161:16.41]He's coming to get me.
[161:19.15]His AI might just be going in a random direction, though.
[161:25.96]I may be spitballing here, but I'm pretty sure that's not what a bulldozer does.
[161:32.46]They eat dirt?
[161:33.64]Oh god fucking dammit.
[161:36.34]That's it.
[161:37.08]I'm not doing that one anymore.
[161:49.01]Why does a bulldozer have hair?
[161:55.35]I don't know.
[161:55.73]Why does Tomic the Tank Engine have a face?
[162:01.77]There is no explaining it.
[162:03.29]Alright, what's that one?
[162:13.49]Flybot?
[162:16.97]No, that's not the one we're doing.
[162:19.57]Something champ?
[162:21.57]Something champ.
[162:22.79]It's hard to read.
[162:24.43]Billiards Champ 3D.
[162:25.83]It's got 3D in the title.
[162:27.99]So you can imagine it probably won't open.
[162:31.11]Let's give it a shot.
[162:34.57]Is it gonna open?
[162:38.43]Nope.
[162:56.64]I think more... I'm gonna sneeze again.
[163:02.84]Why would I turn that on?
[163:04.64]I should turn that off, not on.
[163:07.38]What was the point of that?
[163:12.05]Why would I... Why do I want you guys to see me sneeze?
[163:19.09]There's no reason for that.
[163:21.33]I'm getting excited so you guys can watch me sneeze.
[163:40.86]Now we're going to Flybot.
[163:42.96]That's a huge amount of clicks.
[163:48.62]Flybot.
[163:51.64]You can tell this one's going to be good.
[163:55.47]I'll show you why.
[163:56.11]Because Flybot... I don't have any idea what the guy next to Flybot is.
[164:03.66]But take a look.
[164:06.65]Flybot is on the cover.
[164:12.91]I'm not sure what's going on here.
[164:15.79]Or what this is.
[164:17.85]We've seen Monster Doors.
[164:19.85]But that's Flybot.
[164:21.25]He's the mascot.
[164:31.68]Let's go.
[164:40.06]Thank god, I was so angry.
[164:41.66]I can't.
[164:42.14]Turn it down!
[164:43.06]Turn it down!
[164:43.76]It's still too loud.
[164:44.55]I have to do this one at a time.
[165:16.28]Okay, now... I have to... Okay, so it's gotta go down to the right.
[165:33.11]So we got down to the right.
[165:36.59]I'm gonna say like right there.
[165:37.81]Let me know if it's right.
[165:49.36]It's a little off.
[165:50.04]It needs to be up.
[165:50.90]Go up like half an inch.
[165:58.42]Like that.
[165:58.92]It should be okay.
[166:06.02]As good as it's gonna get.
[166:09.62]Start game.
[166:14.43]Frozen hands planet.
[166:15.35]Be careful.
[166:15.87]This is a very cold and snowy place.
[166:18.29]The hands that inhabit this planet are frozen.
[166:21.98]Hence, they are not dangerous.
[166:24.06]The aliens on this planet are studying flies behavior in cold conditions.
[166:28.26]Your objective is to save the flies from becoming icicles with rocket launchers, grenades, and guns.
[166:44.33]Alright, this is the first platformer of the whole package.
[166:50.08]Free all the flies.
[166:54.62]Free flies.
[167:01.54]It's just raining hell at all times.
[167:03.46]Alright, let's go jump.
[167:06.68]Hint.
[167:07.00]Z, X, C, V. Choose weapon.
[167:09.72]Alright, I only got one.
[167:12.95]V?
[167:15.61]I'm gonna have to sit down on it.
[167:16.67]Okay, X is... Do you kill things, or does it just knock them out?
[167:23.34]I think he's dead.
[167:28.58]Ah.
[167:32.22]Did I free the fly?
[167:33.50]I wanna save that shit.
[167:36.84]Oops.
[167:49.25]What is the music that's playing?
[167:52.92]I have plenty of energy.
[167:56.38]99 energy?
[167:56.74]What does that do?
[168:17.27]This hitbox right on top is the worst.
[168:24.58]Alright, that's three flies.
[168:28.72]I got it.
[168:29.32]That's it, right?
[168:45.24]Wait for transport platform.
[168:49.70]Uh, alright.
[168:54.97]Impatient, but it's fine.
[168:56.17]I win.
[169:00.19]We just go again.
[169:00.85]Don't stop.
[169:01.41]Oh.
[169:01.47]Okay.
[169:02.89]Shoot at the switcher.
[169:24.50]I wanna see a no-hit run in this game.
[169:29.66]Alright, I'm gonna get there and then I'm gonna turn this game on.
[169:40.57]Speedrunner, let's go.
[169:41.53]Look!
[169:42.25]Oh yeah, I died.
[169:49.78]Mission failed.
[169:50.50]The Earth is left without flies.
[169:54.12]Click here to... That's good.
[169:56.02]That's a good thing.
[169:59.12]Flies are fucking horrible.
[170:00.28]I'm glad.
[170:00.68]That's good that they're gone.
[170:06.79]Year 2009.
[170:06.97]April 38.
[170:07.19]Monday.
[170:07.53]Yeah, the 38th day of April in 2009.
[170:09.05]That was real fucked up.
[170:11.47]Remember that?
[170:20.41]No fly with any insect dignity will ever forget this day.
[170:24.50]Yeah, that was the day when hordes of alien scum attacked our little green planet.
[170:29.27]These monstrous green freaks had harassed three grasshoppers, stolen spots from the ladybug's wings, but most importantly, kidnapped all flies from planet Earth.
[170:42.01]Some say they took a bug with them, but that information was later reputed by two stampedes that insist it was a bear, not a bug.
[170:50.28]We can only guess.
[170:54.28]This is a writing assignment for a third grader.
[170:58.51]This is a writing assignment.
[171:01.01]Talk about, give a story of how the aliens came and took the bugs.
[171:06.82]The British intelligence sources have proof that the reason all flies were aborted to the alien spacecraft is because of their brains, or lack thereof to be exact.
[171:15.67]The aliens wanted to know how flies managed to think without having this important neural organ.
[171:20.33]So far the aliens have performed one surgical brain removal to one of their own.
[171:24.96]The experiment was deemed to be a failure.
[171:27.68]Right now all flies from planet Earth are packed inside one gallon glass jugs and are hidden on five different planets.
[171:33.66]But the flies called John and Hans got lucky.
[171:36.66]They managed to befriend the alien who had his brain removed.
[171:40.13]He turned out to be a real groovy dude and let the flies out.
[171:44.05]In the room next door, John and Hans have stumbled upon the latest model of the alien combat robot.
[171:49.13]Hans turned out to be a great mechanic.
[171:51.25]He got inside and started the robot.
[171:53.13]John used to live near the pilot's cafeteria before he managed to learn robots' navigation system.
[171:59.78]They called their robot Flybot.
[172:02.51]Now with such powerful weapon in their arsenal, they've rushed to save their fellow insects.
[172:05.97]May the force be with them.
[172:20.86]May the force be with you.
[172:22.86]That was a joy to read that.
[172:25.42]That was better than the game.
[172:39.58]Hold on.
[172:39.86]Don't click yet.
[172:40.32]Don't click yet.
[172:43.51]I was looking for this game for ages.
[172:46.27]Well, it's Flybot.
[172:58.21]Where are you guys going?
[173:01.10]I can't tell if this is another checkers joke or if this is the one above checkers.
[173:04.50]And it's 100%.
[173:04.72]Why?
[173:10.25]You guys that hell-bent on the one that's above there?
[173:17.83]What is it?
[173:21.49]This is Mystic Store.
[173:32.09]Mystic Store.
[173:35.37]I'm gonna have to change this if it opens.
[173:36.88]Let's hope it does.
[173:40.13]Nope.
[173:43.13]Oh, wait a minute!
[173:44.03]I spoke too soon, it's opening!
[173:48.63]And it's already in a perfect spot.
[173:59.50]Player one.
[174:01.12]Oh, whoops.
[174:20.50]These are shotgun sounds.
[174:26.04]Yeah, they are.
[174:28.02]They really are.
[174:31.16]I wonder what Mystic Store is going to be about.
[174:33.66]I'm actually excited.
[174:35.80]Alright, let's go.
[174:39.09]Temea.
[174:42.03]To make an artifact for the guests, pick up magic elements.
[174:44.51]You can cheer up a guest with the help of potions.
[174:47.47]To finish the level, pick up magic elements and use them.
[174:51.03]Okay.
[174:53.66]Once upon a time, the wise elf L'Oreal built a store where he created magic artifacts with the help of ancient spells.
[175:00.12]Soon after, he left his shop and moved to distant lands.
[175:03.86]Many sages and magicians have tried in vain to master L'Oreal's art.
[175:08.88]Since those times, the shop is empty and does not please the visitors with magic goods.
[175:13.58]But it is likely you'll be able to master the magic of L'Oreal and become the owner of the Mystic Snort.
[175:23.67]Day one of 25.
[175:24.31]Click a group of three or more similar elements to collect them.
[175:28.81]Look at that.
[175:33.67]Collect and make an artifact.
[175:45.45]Over time, a guest becomes impatient.
[175:46.83]Oh, I need to give you what?
[175:47.77]What do you want?
[175:49.06]Wand of Water.
[175:50.36]Sound effects are pretty good.
[176:09.66]He didn't get what he wanted?
[176:12.28]There he is, the wand of water.
[176:16.23]Guest wanted a two, where's the second guest?
[176:19.23]Alright.
[176:19.45]I don't know, this one's just kinda dull.
[176:29.48]The sounds are alright, but the game itself is just click on groups of three or more.
[176:36.36]It's not that difficult.
[176:38.74]Click on the giant color on the screen.
[176:52.33]The door knocking made me go outside?
[176:54.47]Oh, I made it.
[176:57.64]The PSVR.
[177:00.48]I enjoy that, man.
[177:02.88]Except you won't.
[177:12.19]Spend rubies!
[177:16.13]Buy the secrets of the artifacts of the rubies you've collected.
[177:23.22]But who cares?
[177:29.42]I need 60 rubies with Wand of Fire.
[177:36.73]I got it.
[177:37.49]Wand of Gnomes!
[177:45.17]If I had the wherewithal, I would take a one-second clip of the... And cue it up so when I clicked right here, it would do it.
[177:53.73]But I'm not going to do that.
[177:55.27]I'm just going to click the X and say everybody's in pain.
[178:09.92]I'm surprised that one actually opened.
[178:15.72]Click away.
[178:16.14]Where are the clicks?
[178:21.16]What happened?
[178:23.54]What's going on with this poll?
[178:31.96]Is it broken?
[178:33.04]Where is it?
[178:33.40]How come it's not there?
[178:45.19]What the hell?
[178:48.78]I think it's screwed up.
[178:52.64]No, it's there?
[178:53.94]Maybe it took a second.
[178:54.60]Maybe I did it too many times that I broke it.
[179:00.19]We already picked all the good games.
[179:05.09]Except for Cubic Frenzy.
[179:13.86]We were thinking about our choices.
[179:15.20]Alright, Cubic Frenzy.
[179:16.14]Oh boy, this is gonna be interesting.
[179:30.43]Do I have logic slider, cubie groups, click three.
[179:34.04]I need to change, hold on.
[179:35.98]There is no options menu or anything.
[179:40.60]Second, I gotta drag it down to the right.
[179:49.81]Let's see how good that is.
[179:50.67]How does that look?
[179:59.41]Eh, close.
[180:00.42]Almost.
[180:01.04]Close enough.
[180:01.92]No, it's not.
[180:02.54]I can do better.
[180:03.00]It's just a little bit more.
[180:15.98]Alright, that's fine.
[180:16.54]Alright, what does click three mean?
[180:18.12]Click three QB groups or logics ladder.
[180:20.66]Click three.
[180:22.20]Flood, puzzle, arcade, flood.
[180:24.90]Normal.
[180:29.44]It's the same thing I just did.
[180:30.57]Alright, I'm going for a full page of blue.
[180:37.93]Only blue.
[180:38.35]I want a full stack of blue.
[181:00.94]Kids mode.
[181:01.85]It just turns into strawberries.
[181:05.07]And now we gotta get all pandas.
[181:33.07]Have you used the combos?
[182:23.85]No, it's happening.
[182:24.83]It was coming.
[182:28.52]Play the monster game.
[182:30.00]I already did the monster game.
[182:31.08]And I didn't like it.
[182:35.92]Actually, yeah, I did.
[182:36.54]Did I?
[182:36.82]I don't even remember liking it.
[182:41.31]Where was that one?
[182:46.22]Oh, Monster Village is what you're talking about.
[182:48.74]Monster Village, not Monster Doors.
[182:52.64]It's the village where the doors are.
[182:55.02]You get to actually go in their houses now.
[183:01.61]Where the hell was this?
[183:05.77]I don't even remember what... Oh, it's Cubic Frenzy.
[183:08.21]Okay, Monster Village.
[183:11.55]Let's check it out.
[183:22.69]Island Maze Escape has a rat.
[183:27.09]Well, we'll have to check that out another time.
[183:32.21]Monster Village does open.
[183:46.36]Private player.
[183:47.60]What does that mean?
[183:51.34]Private player.
[184:06.95]In a small town by a bridge lived a group of hobsters, a whimsical race of inventors.
[184:12.63]They created an earthly Paradise called Monster Town.
[184:16.56]Word of this settlement spread across the land.
[184:19.26]Envious, the evil monsters banded together in a desperate campaign against the good-hearted villagers.
[184:25.02]Luckily, Zack and Jack learned about the plot and prepared for the assault.
[184:32.13]Surrender or we'll tear your town apart.
[184:33.88]We'll never give in.
[184:35.00]Taste our bullets.
[184:41.58]What?
[184:50.67]Why is it only two monsters?
[184:52.15]Why are you only attacking with one fish?
[185:01.93]Guy on the top is doing all the work.
[185:07.77]Can I speed this up?
[185:16.30]Catch it.
[185:16.66]I have machine gun.
[185:21.90]This is actually kind of good.
[185:24.74]Bonuses in red circles have a negative effect.
[185:26.98]Avoid them.
[185:35.21]I like this game.
[185:37.47]Good choice.
[185:38.05]Who picked this?
[185:38.97]Excellent choice.
[185:42.51]Avoid bullets or hits.
[185:44.47]I need to up the difficulty.
[185:54.13]That's the super weapon.
[185:56.07]And then you right click to activate a super weapon.
[186:03.60]That was really loud.
[186:05.46]But it worked.
[186:06.33]Very effective.
[186:09.41]This machine is harmless, but soap bubbles it launches will hinder you.
[186:14.81]But it's not harmless.
[186:23.64]Your rank is private.
[186:47.46]I could hear the audible gasp in the audience there when I didn't get that.
[186:50.50]25.
[186:50.52]What is that?
[186:51.41]Now if this game had upgrades, I could see myself playing this on
[187:10.40]Like mini-clip.
[187:12.63]Like three or four hours straight.
[187:17.74]Shitty games with banging soundtracks.
[187:20.52]The Stream.
[187:37.57]rename the stream shitty game well bad games with banging soundtracks alright at what point uh are people people are gonna be done with this one because I'm already I'm pretty much already done I want a boss though
[188:09.73]I'm gonna say level one, location one, level five, is gonna be the boss.
[188:15.83]I have to see the first boss.
[188:28.44]Mute this one to do the sound effects.
[188:29.80]There's no way, I'm only human.
[188:31.60]I would have to overlap sound effects.
[188:37.73]Hold on.
[189:00.54]Not fast enough.
[189:22.42]Alright, this is the boss.
[189:23.22]I'm ready.
[189:23.74]I'm ready for the boss.
[189:24.29]I'm ready!
[189:32.19]That's the guy from the cover.
[189:34.43]We just saw the ears monster.
[189:44.43]Now I can end this happily.
[189:54.60]Incoming large enemy!
[189:56.50]Oh, I thought that was it Two gumbos Hey Art!
[190:23.54]Art's not bad
[190:26.93]This game's relatively fun.
[190:29.17]Mmm, yeah.
[190:30.85]It's a little easy.
[190:36.34]It's alright, though.
[190:43.34]It's, like, kind of a fun game.
[190:46.07]I can't click the X. What happens if I get by?
[190:51.96]Did you lose?
[190:53.77]Did it just... Holy shit!
[190:58.15]That was Monsters Inc.
[191:22.93]Let's cover it up.
[191:29.77]I hate this wallpaper.
[191:34.27]Well, I'm sorry.
[191:37.33]I'll change it if I get a good one.
[191:46.32]This next one is either Pyramid Escape or Island Maze Escape.
[191:55.80]That looks like Pyramid.
[192:00.01]There, I can see the bottom of that.
[192:01.13]That's Pyramid Escape.
[192:02.01]Let's give it a whirl.
[192:13.54]Please wait a bit.
[192:14.30]This window won't appear again, is what this says.
[192:17.13]Why is there a countdown?
[192:18.77]What do you mean?
[192:20.53]What are you doing?
[192:22.17]Why?
[192:22.33]Oh, alright, hold on.
[192:30.91]The way to the treasure is shown on this map.
[192:33.21]This road might lead there.
[192:34.47]Full speed ahead.
[192:37.43]I wish you could have seen that.
[192:38.59]Oh my god, you gotta see this.
[192:40.07]This is fucking outrageous.
[192:56.63]Stupid fellow.
[192:57.33]If he knew what was waiting for him ahead, no one managed to avoid our traps and escaped alive.
[193:02.47]We'll have a real cool time.
[193:09.01]I remember this one.
[193:09.75]Remember?
[193:10.57]I remember.
[193:11.39]I remember this one.
[193:12.90]He got the french fries on his back.
[193:48.84]Select a game world.
[194:01.85]This game world has been created especially for novices and kids.
[194:05.43]This game world has been created for more professional players.
[194:16.97]Gameplay demonstration.
[194:55.74]That was a pretty good move.
[195:05.99]Can I get it?
[195:07.83]Got that one.
[195:12.32]Two more?
[195:12.72]I think I can drop these guys down.
[195:18.25]Go straight through here and then grab this last one, that's it.
[195:20.83]I'm gonna get the exit, that's kinda good.
[195:23.19]Cool.
[195:25.85]Alright, thank you.
[195:35.50]Shift-Z-X.
[195:37.52]Move the cursor, dig a hole.
[195:41.62]Why didn't you do this in the gameplay demonstration for me?
[195:44.62]What the hell is that?
[196:05.72]Am I trapped in here?
[196:27.59]Just dig down.
[196:28.55]I can't.
[196:52.55]Let's try this one.
[196:54.19]What?
[196:54.49]This is supposed to be the easy one!
[197:24.23]You gotta be kidding me.
[197:25.97]Lost to Pyramid Escape.
[197:28.47]Yeah, I did.
[197:29.81]But that doesn't embarrass me at all.
[197:33.14]Oh no, I lost to Pyramid Escape.
[197:42.26]What is it?
[197:43.58]Suck and... Suck and what?
[197:49.36]Oh no, that's Seek.
[197:53.59]It said something else.
[197:59.21]Because my... Hey, look.
[198:01.13]My window is a lot smaller because I'm not full screened over here on OBS.
[198:08.71]Oh, yay, yay.
[198:10.39]That's why I'm reading these so incorrectly.
[198:14.50]Seek and find collection.
[198:18.10]We're getting close to the end here.
[198:23.65]Seek and find.
[198:24.91]Oh no, is that not seek and find?
[198:32.44]No, it is.
[198:33.22]That's seek and find.
[198:43.33]Oh, where the hell is that though?
[198:45.23]What game one is that on?
[198:46.85]Because I had to chop up a couple of them because they were too big.
[198:51.66]There it is.
[198:52.04]Seek and find collection one.
[198:58.16]Let's go.
[198:58.46]Alright.
[199:08.25]No more clicking for now.
[199:14.33]Old bedroom.
[199:15.55]Southwestern room.
[199:17.97]Flower riot.
[199:24.59]We gotta do flower riot.
[199:27.55]Click anywhere on either image where you spot a difference.
[199:29.80]Find all seven before time runs out.
[199:36.10]Yeah, that's, uh, green.
[199:41.48]Look at all these chatters here, rioting.
[199:48.33]Um.
[199:50.13]There's too many colors, I can't do it.
[199:52.71]Yeah, I see that one.
[199:56.88]This is horrible.
[199:58.26]I feel like if I lean in and cross my eyes, I'm going to see a magic eye image.
[200:19.11]This is a jump scare game.
[200:20.91]Yeah, it is.
[200:21.91]It's the same kind of... Alright, you guys do it.
[200:23.95]I can't look at it anymore.
[200:27.45]I can't.
[200:28.01]My brain.
[200:29.27]Can you find them, please?
[200:30.45]So we can get out of this.
[200:36.21]Nice.
[200:36.53]Good job.
[200:38.39]Nice.
[200:38.81]Good work.
[200:39.29]I already got that one.
[200:42.08]Alright.
[200:42.66]Which one over here?
[200:43.12]What are you trying to get over here?
[200:43.92]I already got that one.
[200:46.04]We only have 224 seconds.
[200:51.96]Doesn't this the one that boos at you if you don't do it?
[201:02.65]Alright, come on.
[201:08.99]Help me.
[201:13.49]I honestly, I think I broke the extension.
[201:17.08]I've used this, I've restarted it and turned it back on so many times that I may have destroyed it.
[201:22.02]I'm gonna have to reinstall the extension after this.
[201:27.72]That's all I'm saying.
[201:29.90]Nice work.
[201:35.84]Power Riot Mirror.
[201:42.48]Oh my god, that's even worse.
[201:43.68]No, thank you.
[201:46.52]Sitting Room.
[201:54.66]No, I don't want to... No.
[201:55.31]No.
[201:59.81]No.
[202:12.66]Thirsty.
[202:13.04]Anybody want to say thirsty?
[202:15.29]I need like more drink.
[202:20.71]I need like a tall glass of water.
[202:23.17]I'm going to go.
[202:23.63]I need to hydrate.
[202:24.27]You guys vote.
[202:24.75]I'll be right back.
[202:25.54]Sorry this is the second break in like less than three or four hours.
[202:29.24]But I'm going to go grab a water.
[202:31.38]Because I had like a Coke and I don't want that anymore.
[202:33.22]I want like a tall glass of cold water.
[202:35.45]Be right back.
[204:10.21]Okay.
[204:12.25]Alright.
[204:14.09]I'm hydrated.
[204:15.73]I'm good to go.
[204:17.93]Where are we going?
[204:20.89]Uh... I don't know where this is being clicked on.
[204:30.54]I'm going to say that's Island Escape.
[204:37.30]If I were to take a guess...
[204:43.52]Island Maze Escape.
[204:45.70]Good luck.
[204:54.61]I mean, I got a screen here.
[205:01.62]It wanted to work.
[205:02.58]No, it didn't.
[205:26.58]I gotta be very careful because this one is on the edge.
[205:30.03]Let me go ahead and do this.
[205:36.43]Drag it down.
[205:37.09]This one's so cute.
[205:39.05]Wait till you guys see this.
[206:03.20]Island maze escape.
[206:04.64]And I just fucking ruined it.
[206:05.72]No, I didn't.
[206:07.26]Now let's go.
[206:08.80]Kids play.
[206:10.36]Or standard.
[206:12.02]Level one.
[206:15.10]Start.
[206:15.50]Try to solve.
[206:16.78]What am I solving?
[206:20.97]What do you solve?
[206:39.00]I'm not sure what I'm solving here.
[207:04.33]So why can I not walk?
[207:05.82]Is it because of the different shapes?
[207:08.14]I can't walk backwards now.
[207:09.72]Something's fucked up here.
[207:21.21]Go.
[207:22.61]Walk back this way.
[207:25.04]The clicks don't register.
[207:36.45]60% of every click doesn't work.
[207:42.78]Um, alright, you saw that, like, how many times did I click that?
[207:46.82]Two.
[207:48.36]One.
[207:49.42]One.
[207:50.68]One.
[207:51.18]One.
[207:52.20]What the fuck was that?
[207:54.48]Two.
[207:54.96]Three.
[207:55.68]Three clicks.
[207:56.58]One.
[207:57.26]One.
[207:58.48]One.
[207:58.70]Two.
[207:58.78]Three.
[207:59.18]What?
[208:08.56]Why is it randomizing the amount of clicks it takes me to go?
[208:11.18]Do it!
[208:20.71]I'm just gonna spam it.
[208:28.98]Okay, that's how you do it.
[208:30.52]I have to click as fast as I can.
[208:32.62]Click and hold?
[208:34.86]No, it's not doing anything.
[208:37.41]I have to literally, literally.
[208:40.81]Why is it, get over there.
[208:47.77]Go!
[208:49.25]Oh, my fingers!
[209:12.28]Oh my god.
[209:13.44]I want you to listen.
[209:14.89]I'm gonna get it in this bright spot.
[209:21.68]Mute the fucking audio.
[209:22.70]You ready?
[209:52.80]I can't get back there now.
[209:53.86]I can't do it anymore.
[210:02.41]I can't do it.
[210:03.01]I'm sorry.
[210:03.39]I'm not gonna do it.
[210:17.58]I guess he wasn't lying.
[210:18.64]That's a first.
[210:19.26]We think I'm just making up this shit all the time.
[210:23.24]What do you mean he's not like... If I say something's happening, I'm not gonna pretend that it's not like it's happening for... For what?
[210:30.67]Why would I do that?
[210:31.41]I... You... I didn't... Oh, oh, it was left click.
[210:35.35]It was left click.
[211:16.00]Alright, where is that?
[211:17.68]That was called click between three and seven times to get the character to move one space.
[211:24.64]It's mind-numbing.
[211:28.77]No, don't click on that.
[211:29.85]It's not what's going up.
[211:33.33]I see 29% over here on... 29% currently on Gardenland Tycoon.
[211:47.79]Okay.
[211:51.29]Let's give it a try.
[211:59.47]Gonna have to change this.
[212:07.26]Casual Force Entertainment is the name of this company.
[212:09.60]Cool.
[212:14.04]It's been over 24 hours and he's still going?
[212:17.30]Yeah, the stream has not turned off.
[212:36.92]I know everybody wants me to, but hold on.
[212:38.46]It's one of those things where it sneaks away when I click.
[212:49.35]That's not bad right there.
[212:50.15]Alright.
[212:55.96]I'm ready.
[212:56.32]What is this called?
[212:57.94]Gardenland Tycoon?
[212:58.90]Oh, you didn't hear the music!
[213:06.94]The music's a bit fart.
[213:10.57]Harvest five bags of sunflower seeds to complete this level.
[213:14.15]This is the number of points you'll earn from completing the level.
[213:16.23]Minus 100 points, okay.
[213:19.24]You will also earn bonus points depending on how fast you click a level.
[213:21.76]Click on the close button.
[213:23.34]Planting spot.
[213:25.30]Sunflower seeds.
[213:26.04]Click on the sunflower seeds to get an action menu of water.
[213:33.26]Okay, you've increased the watering level of your sunflower and earned an additional heart.
[213:37.42]The more hearts you earn, the more produce you'll harvest.
[213:39.64]Watering levels decrease over time, so keep an eye on them.
[213:44.14]Do the dirt thing.
[213:55.33]I hate games like this.
[213:57.95]Please clap along with the music.
[213:59.57]Why?
[214:00.19]Is it desynced?
[214:04.26]I don't know why it's always desynced.
[215:00.09]Weird OBS delay going on.
[215:05.47]Here are your points.
[215:06.03]That's a weird track, that's like in the game.
[215:28.51]Remember, this is literally a Quake ripoff.
[215:30.39]What the fuck?
[215:31.12]Play something else.
[215:35.88]You're right.
[215:38.50]I don't want to give time to a game that's a Quake ripoff.
[215:44.45]That was boring.
[215:46.01]Boring.
[215:58.06]We're getting real close.
[215:59.76]There's only like 15 more.
[216:03.90]I think it might be that time to start opening them.
[216:10.09]I'm just blowing through them.
[216:11.71]Like, does it open?
[216:12.37]Yes or no?
[216:13.03]And yes?
[216:13.45]Alright, let's go.
[216:13.89]Alright, where are we going?
[216:18.61]Right in the middle?
[216:27.02]Flower Garden Tycoon.
[216:28.42]Oh my fucking god.
[216:33.54]Is it the same game?
[216:37.90]Flower Land Tycoon, Flower Garden Tycoon.
[216:41.99]That hurts my ears.
[216:42.81]I'm going to mute that because it's going to hurt yours too.
[216:47.49]This hurts very badly.
[216:49.73]Holy shit, this is terrifying.
[216:51.19]Hold on.
[216:51.55]Oh!
[216:55.23]Oh!
[217:09.21]That's why everybody wanted me to play this so badly.
[217:16.73]I wonder if this one's any different.
[217:18.81]The lady is more scary than anything.
[217:20.85]Alright, audio should be fine now.
[217:22.29]My gardens.
[217:23.18]New garden.
[217:24.18]Uh...
[217:43.15]Um, what's going on?
[217:45.37]Oh, it's actually just a garden simulator.
[221:33.59]I haven't been talking for like two or three straight minutes.
[221:37.27]Oh, this tube's locked in here.
[221:47.16]Wait.
[221:52.32]It's worth it, trust me.
[221:54.12]I'm gonna mute a bunch of stuff for now.
[221:57.44]Just wait one second.
[222:18.68]No, it's gonna take too long.
[222:20.50]It's gonna take too long.
[222:21.44]I was gonna have, like, 30 gnomes.
[222:24.69]Looping.
[222:25.29]And then, like, fucking, like... Never mind.
[222:30.59]It's gonna take so long.
[223:10.49]Alright, here we go.
[223:11.25]You guys ready?
[223:28.05]I don't want to get gnomed anymore, okay?
[223:34.93]No more of that.
[224:12.16]That was a telling.
[224:16.67]That was every time I've ever been gnomed.
[224:21.47]This is me just throwing it, hitting the X button.
[224:33.13]Alright, where are we going?
[224:47.08]I think I just caused my internet to have a problem from that one.
[224:57.84]I'm like dropping frames now.
[225:00.46]I angered the fucking gnome gods.
[225:04.34]Sacrificing every gnome joke.
[225:06.54]Stop doing it, dick.
[225:15.92]Where was it?
[225:17.64]I don't even know where the hell this is.
[225:25.15]No.
[225:29.97]Oh, it's right here.
[225:30.49]Okay.
[225:32.17]Where was that gnome?
[225:37.01]I don't know where the hell it is.
[225:37.83]Was it called Garden Mania or something?
[225:41.32]Garden Fun?
[225:45.95]Alright, it's time for streamer's choice.
[225:50.05]Put the fire on instead of the X. My computer will crash.
[226:03.62]I don't even know where it is.
[226:05.64]Where is it?
[226:07.03]There, it's right here.
[226:08.53]Alright, there you go.
[226:10.17]That one's currently on fire.
[226:11.47]You guys are real funny.
[226:13.09]This is hysterical stuff.
[226:15.64]I mean, we're talking just like... Alright, it's time for streamer's choice.
[226:18.36]I'm just going to go through them.
[226:28.00]There's only like 10 or 15 more.
[226:30.46]Alright, you've lost it.
[226:31.52]Privilege is gone.
[226:34.62]Somebody said, I legit want Mystic Diamonds.
[226:38.28]So, that's what I'm going to click on.
[226:44.09]Mystic Diamonds is
[226:46.62]Sure.
[226:55.33]I wonder, the internet is kind of having a problem.
[226:58.61]Sometimes it does this, maybe once every couple weeks.
[227:01.41]Since the, uh, when it was fixed permanently.
[227:04.61]We drop a few thousand frames, usually it fixes itself, so.
[227:10.99]Alright, where, where is that?
[227:15.32]What was it called?
[227:15.88]I don't even remember what it was.
[227:18.91]Help me out here.

[241:33.18]A mouse trap.
[241:39.19]And they have poison.
[241:47.41]This person has got so many issues.
[241:49.87]I don't even know where to start.
[242:04.35]Imagine putting some of this shit in a full watermelon.
[242:15.50]Two cooked lobsters in a balloon.
[242:18.83]Oh, this is slaying me.

[243:23.73]Imagine storing a cooked crab next to a birthday cake and none of them are in any type of storage.
[243:30.03]This cake is gonna taste like dead salty crabfish.
[243:41.58]I can't handle that anymore.
[243:42.62]I gotta go back.
[243:45.26]Oh my god.
[243:54.77]I don't even know... There's a baseball in the fridge, isn't there?
[244:04.22]I need to stay here, because there might be another scenario where there's another fridge with stuff in it.
[244:13.29]I need a truck and a pencil.
[244:21.92]I accidentally just clicked on that.
[244:23.56]Where's the truck?
[244:25.18]Anybody see a truck?
[244:31.64]Okay.
[244:35.37]Keys.

[244:58.96]Alright.
[245:00.28]Items to use.
[245:01.12]Puzzles to solve.
[245:02.44]Items to use.
[245:06.42]What?
[245:08.54]What the fuck?
[245:11.26]Who's flying the plane?
[245:42.57]The fuck is this?
[245:46.53]My name is Gordon Jones.
[245:48.07]I'd like to come in.
[245:49.47]I called you about your grandfather's disappearance.
[245:51.83]His plane vanished in a storm over the Pacific Ocean.
[245:56.04]There's dialog options.
[245:57.14]Was he alone in the plane?
[245:58.92]Yes, your grandfather was a great pilot and had rented a light plane for a day trip.
[246:04.42]How did he get caught up in the storm?
[246:06.13]I don't know.
[246:07.25]He had access to the local weather report before he left.
[246:10.57]By the way, do you know his company specializes in treasure hunting?
[246:14.66]Of course.
[246:15.20]Grandpa loves stories about lost treasure.
[246:18.14]I want you to meet Dick Robinson.
[246:21.00]A Jerma character name.
[246:23.64]His assistant.
[246:44.15]I had the honor of working with your grandfather.
[246:46.41]He told me a lot about you.
[246:49.65]Which treasure was Grandpa seeking when he disappeared?
[246:53.71]Our last quest ended in failure.
[246:55.55]We spent a year looking for an empty tomb.
[246:58.03]I bet Grandpa was upset.
[247:01.64]He was.
[247:02.84]Someone found the tomb and raided it right when we got there.
[247:06.92]Shortly before his disappearance, he asked me to draw up his will.
[247:10.46]According to this document, if he dies, the company is yours.
[247:15.74]I'm his only heir?
[247:17.92]Correct.
[247:18.88]However, the will includes the condition you must satisfy, and I admit it's quite unusual.
[247:25.80]That's just like Grandpa.
[247:27.96]I'd be surprised if all I needed to do was sign it.
[247:32.62]You'll have a limited amount of time in which to find the items mentioned in the will.
[247:37.08]Do you agree to its conditions?
[247:40.06]Sure, this is going to be fun.
[247:41.92]If time runs out, the company gets a new owner or is put up for sale.
[247:53.68]Hey, that's Fang.
[247:56.04]He's from South America.
[247:57.54]During one of my trips there, he clamped onto my boots so hard we had no choice but to adopt him.
[248:03.59]Thanks.
[248:05.59]Let's go.
[248:07.59]Help.
[248:10.49]We're staying in this one.
[248:11.29]This one's great.
[248:13.57]And Grandpa, you sure were fucked up putting paintings on the ceiling.
[248:19.56]Why?
[248:21.20]Why are these paintings up here?
[248:24.12]They're all crooked.
[248:25.98]Grandpa took a baseball bat to his house and just started putting, like, command strips on the ceiling.
[248:34.51]Horse.
[248:35.81]We've got, uh... A skull.
[248:42.15]That's not it.
[248:43.35]That's not it.
[248:46.84]Tortoise on stairs.
[248:49.14]But I can't click it.
[248:52.56]Net, key, butterfly.
[248:53.96]What are you guys looking?
[248:56.80]Horse.
[249:09.07]Refresh.
[249:12.81]Net, horse, butterfly, key.
[249:15.51]How much time is left?
[249:19.97]I can't go in a key at the bottom of an aquarium guarded by a piranha.
[249:23.19]That's grandpa for you.
[249:24.41]It must be hungry.
[249:26.63]We can't go in there.
[249:34.92]The time!
[249:36.56]Guys.
[249:38.04]Guys.
[249:38.94]I'm about to lose the company.
[249:42.28]I'm about to lose the company.
[249:45.92]That's a golf club.
[249:49.32]Why are you clicking on the golf club?
[249:52.21]None of these are right!
[249:56.45]It's locked.
[250:10.50]Nobody clicked on the thermostat.
[250:12.58]That's not even... What?
[250:27.75]Why?
[250:29.09]Oh, I get it.
[250:29.75]You guys are clicking on the bullseye.
[250:36.32]This is fucking stupid.
[250:38.52]Where is a net?
[250:40.45]I already clicked on the horse.
[250:41.85]Give me another one.
[250:44.75]What?
[250:46.27]Sometimes the dark hides important things.
[250:47.97]It looks like there's something behind the plant.
[250:56.51]Use the net on the piranha.
[250:58.89]Alright, get out of here.
[251:00.27]I can do it myself.
[251:01.07]I can.
[251:03.60]Net on piranha.
[251:06.38]Great, now we can get the key without losing an arm.
[251:08.92]Get the key.
[251:10.16]Key goes into the cabinet.
[251:12.86]Key on cabinet.
[251:14.88]Great, now let's look inside.
[251:16.16]Might contain the items we need.
[251:25.22]Oh my fucking god, what a disaster.
[251:26.75]Okay, got the calendar.
[251:29.35]Ruler, butterfly, horse, eraser.
[251:33.21]Horse?

[254:04.55]Uh... I'm going... A dry plant?
[254:14.59]No one's been in here for a long time.

[256:14.12]Alright, let's see what we got.
[256:16.26]How is that a ship, but that isn't up there?
[256:20.73]Huh?

[256:24.65]That's a ship up there.
[256:25.89]Zoom in.
[256:33.56]I should try spinning it and inspecting it from all sides.
[256:39.30]It looks like something is written on this side of the globe.
[256:41.66]Five.
[256:43.87]Oh my god, this is gonna be unbearable.
[256:47.08]I thought it's locked.

[261:16.77]There's the boomerang.
[261:17.49]Number, bell, and a weight.
[261:34.36]Grandpa, why did you make this so horrible?
[261:37.22]That's not a bell, that's a pawn.
[261:45.34]The bell on the chandelier, but is there though?
[261:47.78]I keep clicking here and it's not doing anything.
[261:52.88]Why are we still playing this?
[261:53.74]Because I need another fridge scenario.
[261:58.51]That looks like a wait, doesn't it?
[262:01.81]Alright, what the fuck are they talking about?
[262:03.55]It was the number 2. 2615!
[262:11.48]Yes, I thought it's locked.
[262:12.44]26... I know.
[262:13.54]2615.
[262:13.76]Open the safe.
[262:18.86]Let's try 1615.
[262:21.56]Abracadabra.
[262:22.74]And it didn't open because that's not what this says.
[262:28.51]You got it wrong.
[262:30.69]Abracadabra.
[262:39.13]That's so funny.
[262:40.07]Diary.
[262:45.69]Let's take grandpa's social security number.
[262:47.55]Key.
[262:51.61]Bell and wait.
[262:52.47]There's another bell and there's a wait in here somewhere probably, right?
[262:55.75]I don't see a wait.
[263:11.03]I don't need those car keys.
[263:14.68]Wait a minute.
[263:16.34]iPhone.
[263:16.78]Coin.
[263:17.16]Two coins.
[263:20.59]Top left.
[263:45.10]In front of the gold statue!
[263:49.46]That's a gun.
[263:53.73]Alright, help me out here.
[264:23.96]oh look who it is wait wait how is this my desktop background but I don't have the image
[264:56.88]I have to get these ready to have them come up when they pop up.
[265:01.97]I'm gonna add image.
[265:03.25]These are fucking perfect.
[265:04.47]Where the hell am I even saving these to?
[265:10.71]Save to the... Does this one have an alpha channel?
[265:25.12]Alright, we gotta get these set up.
[265:35.59]So they're always right here.
[265:50.04]And then, make sure that he is in the right spot.
[265:53.24]He is, okay.
[266:00.14]Now we gotta add the other guy.
[266:25.49]Okay.
[266:27.15]Alright.
[266:27.83]I'm ready.
[266:28.41]Let's go.
[266:31.19]What the fuck is this?
[266:32.23]It's another person.
[266:34.55]No, there are two people.
[266:36.06]Two!
[266:37.44]Uh, Gordon Jones, I presume?
[266:41.22]Yes.
[266:41.48]My name is Richard Rosenberg.
[266:44.60]I have a business proposal for you.
[266:47.40]Can we talk in private?
[266:49.71]Sure.
[266:50.13]Let's go to my grandfather's.
[266:51.31]Uh, I mean, I mean to my office.
[266:55.53]As I said, I have a business proposal in which you might be interested.
[266:59.51]I'd like to purchase your grandfather's company.
[267:06.40]Why didn't you approach my grandfather with this proposal?
[267:09.84]I approached your grandfather several times, but he didn't want to hear anything about selling his business.
[267:16.22]I assume he had a reason for turning you down.
[267:19.30]Only his stubbornness had he agreed he would have been living in a mansion right now.
[267:24.46]But who knows where he is?
[267:27.54]What are you saying?
[267:29.58]Nothing.
[267:30.02]I'm stating the facts.
[267:31.64]Now will you excuse me?
[267:33.12]I have urgent business to attend to.
[267:35.48]How'd it go?
[267:41.60]Uh...
[267:48.75]Who's that girl?
[268:08.20]Catherine Queen.
[268:09.50]She's the leading treasure specialist in Rosenberg's company.
[268:12.64]By the way, she's a professor of archaeology.
[268:16.20]She majored in ancient cultures and graduated with honors.
[268:20.42]So that's who we're competing against.
[268:22.40]I have a rather tactless question to ask.
[268:25.20]What did he say to his proposal?
[268:28.42]I said I'd think about it, but now I have a feeling he didn't tell me the whole truth.
[268:33.22]Take my advice.
[268:34.66]Don't believe in a single word he says.
[268:37.90]Then I'll definitely say no.
[268:39.72]At least until I figure out what this whole treasure hunting thing is about.
[268:43.28]Besides, where else could I find such an exciting job?
[268:48.42]Glad to hear it, mate.
[268:49.92]Welcome aboard.
[268:54.24]He needs to be off the screen.
[269:01.75]In the early t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t visit the museum and collect all known information about the expedition.
[269:07.49]Oh, nothing.
[269:12.07]Sometimes you can find very useful things in museums.
[269:14.79]Let's start here.
[269:15.39]I had a more romantic picture of what treasure hunting would be like.
[269:35.20]I know.
[269:36.18]The treasure map, a spade and a chest full of gold.
[269:39.90]A chest full of gold would be perfect right about now.
[269:43.57]What are you looking for?
[269:46.89]Anything that relates to the archaeological expedition and the sunken ship.
[269:50.43]Please.
[270:02.14]Please!
[270:03.82]Please.
[270:05.45]Please, do not touch the exhibits.
[270:08.03]This is a museum, after all.
[270:11.05]Oh, sorry about that.
[270:12.31]I didn't mean any harm.
[270:14.85]Please, be careful.
[270:17.09]Some of these items are so fragile that a single touch can damage them a little bit.
[270:24.48]The only problem with this museum is it doesn't allow anyone to use the exhibits for personal reasons.
[270:29.16]That includes treasure hunters.
[270:33.94]Uh, what do we do now?
[270:36.27]We distract the guards using the fire alarm.
[270:40.85]How's that supposed to help?
[270:43.43]They're instructed to evacuate all visitors and leave the premises when the fire alarm goes off.
[270:50.79]Well, we have to find a way to stay in the museum, so... We could get lost in here.
[270:56.49]There are so many nooks and crannies.
[270:59.36]I know!
[271:21.37]Excuse me, how do we get to the hall where they keep the artifacts from Greece?
[271:27.39]The strategy turns out right and then when you come to the end of the hall that will take you to the prehistoric expedition somebody asked us
[271:38.57]Alright, let's go.
[272:09.24]Why am I still in this one?
[272:14.22]Is there a reason why we're still in this?
[272:18.97]What are you guys clicking?
[272:30.09]I can't click anything unless it's the thing that you need to smoke?
[272:32.97]Have a cigarette.
[272:35.40]Oh, the fire alarm.
[272:44.91]The Museum S heat detector which is connected to the fire alarm.
[272:49.93]Use a small flame to activate it.
[272:54.37]What?
[272:56.63]Is it like a lighter or cigarettes or something?
[273:23.63]a lamp I'm not gonna do anything trust this why why did you just link this to me why it's me like sucking on swallowing hot dogs
[273:49.38]This is not relevant at all to what we're doing.
[273:52.74]Not even remotely close to anything going on on the screen right now.
[274:05.79]I clicked on the wrong one.
[274:11.21]This one.
[274:15.15]Oh my god.
[274:16.31]This one.
[274:22.51]30 more games to play.
[274:33.38]I'm just gonna do the cheat code.
[274:42.30]I already did this.
[274:45.03]I know, I already clicked on that one.
[274:56.08]We need something that makes heat.
[274:58.22]Heat.
[275:02.06]Heat.
[275:02.98]There are matches on the ground.
[275:13.75]That's a necklace.
[275:16.10]I'm using these hints.
[275:17.12]I know.
[275:17.70]I get it.
[275:18.34]I have to buy some more coins.
[275:24.62]Do I need to go back to the map?
[275:34.48]Hold on, so I- wait, you're telling me that I have to go back into Grandpa's cabinet?
[275:44.99]Cigarette, cigarette, cigarette.
[275:48.89]Spider on glow.
[275:51.47]Is it backtracking?
[275:54.94]There is backtracking.
[275:56.86]There's not.
[275:59.24]Yes, there is.
[276:00.82]Un-fucking-believable.
[276:05.65]You got shit in me.
[276:14.69]Attention!
[276:15.71]Do not panic!
[276:16.49]Everyone leave the building!
[276:21.97]Hiding inside this sarcophagus was a great idea, but aren't you worried about the curse of the pharaohs?
[276:28.10]Don't worry.
[276:29.20]This is just a replica.
[276:30.90]If you knock on it, you can hear it's made of plastic.
[276:35.00]It sounds like stone to me.
[276:37.30]Sounds real to me.
[276:39.08]But there's no point in worrying about that now.
[276:41.21]We're already inside of it.
[276:44.75]When was the last time you saw my grandfather?
[276:46.61]The week before he disappeared.
[276:48.85]Do you remember what you talked about?
[276:52.68]He said he found something really big.
[276:57.48]Something what?
[276:59.46]He didn't tell me.
[277:00.46]I only know he was going to Paris after his vacation.
[277:06.47]I never realized how uncomfortable and dusty the inside of our sarcophagus can be.
[277:12.13]I haven't heard any mummies complaining.
[277:15.81]Now, come on.
[277:16.49]We don't have much time before the fire department gets here.
[277:23.92]No, that was just a match- The door has a code lock!
[277:29.89]I wonder what's behind it.
[277:32.73]We only have to pick matching pairs of numbers to open it, so we'll know soon enough.
[277:53.73]We'll definitely find something useful in here.
[278:00.82]Here come the police!
[278:30.02]Spider.
[278:31.00]Film reel, sea compass, police helmet.
[278:32.69]I mean, that's a... How is that not a police helmet?
[278:40.11]Is that just a regular bike helmet?
[278:42.03]How?
[278:54.34]Film reel.
[278:59.97]I know, there's a scary cat in there.
[279:01.51]I see it.
[279:01.91]I need spy glasses.
[279:09.30]Hmm.
[279:10.54]A bottle?
[279:11.86]I know those two are outside.
[279:16.78]Lighthouse.
[279:19.58]Let's get these out of the way.
[279:20.50]They're both right here.
[279:24.92]This is all wrong now.
[279:25.84]Let me change it.
[279:32.63]I know.
[279:32.93]Don't click this.
[279:33.67]I know everyone's gonna go, Cat!
[279:35.53]Click on the cat!
[279:36.57]Click on the cat!
[279:37.99]Why is it 100% up here?
[279:40.81]There's nothing here.
[279:51.00]Spyglass.
[279:55.84]Lighthouse.
[279:56.28]Sea compass.
[279:56.80]Police helmet.
[279:57.50]Sea compass.
[279:59.50]Sea compass.
[280:03.07]C compass.
[280:03.77]A lot of S sound in that.
[280:11.88]What are you looking at over here?
[280:16.18]Am I clicking on lady?
[280:22.87]Well, that's a painting of a lighthouse.
[280:24.87]Good work, guys.
[280:30.91]Need three more spy glasses, a sea compass, and a police helmet.
[280:36.71]Okay.
[280:39.43]Everyone wanted me to go in here, apparently.
[280:47.39]Spy glass.
[280:51.59]Coin.
[280:55.33]Spy glasses.
[280:56.51]Looking for spy glasses.
[281:03.61]Oh, oh, oh, oh, people are freaking out about the police.
[281:06.69]Okay.
[281:09.47]I don't, I don't live in England.
[281:11.21]Okay.
[281:12.79]That's not what a police helmet looks like.
[281:16.80]Where I am.
[281:21.32]It didn't say... Click glasses.
[281:30.20]Spy?
[281:30.78]No, those are glasses, guys.
[281:32.57]Those aren't spy glasses.
[281:34.29]There's a difference.
[281:39.36]Sea compass.
[281:44.38]That doesn't do anything.
[282:02.29]Go back to the cabinets.
[282:03.55]Fucking cabinet.
[282:06.31]I can't believe I have to go back in a cabinet.
[282:10.16]Wall... No, this isn't even right.
[282:11.36]This is all different now.
[282:16.52]This is just a bonus level.
[282:30.79]This equipment might be new, but it's not new.
[282:34.15]It's still reliable.
[282:35.85]Let's watch the movie.
[282:37.47]Great, we can watch the movie.
[282:40.97]And 20 years ago, when Grandpa Stevenson went down to the pyramids, he found himself trapped underneath.
[282:49.48]After 25 hours of nearly starving, Grandpa ate his way out of the pyramids with a spoon.
[282:56.02]The pyramids, if you did not know, funnily enough, are made out of cinnamon sugar.
[283:02.22]What the fuck is this supposed to be?
[283:03.16]Okay, found the camel.
[283:09.87]I was waiting for something to happen.
[283:11.05]I was filling air there.
[283:23.83]You motherfuckers clicking on this every time.
[283:34.46]There's no reason to click this, the fish is gone.
[283:42.12]Golden egg?
[283:42.76]I don't need to be here, this is not progression.
[283:48.76]This is not progressing the story.
[283:50.12]No, I'm going back.
[283:59.47]I need a sea compass and two spy glasses.
[284:04.92]Get on it.
[284:16.24]Nice.
[284:20.10]Spyglass, come on.
[284:21.76]Get on it.
[284:51.20]Everyone does the same fucking thing.
[284:54.38]You click on the cat eyes, the glasses.
[285:06.73]I just wanna- that's just- just find it.
[285:11.81]There's nothing here.
[285:12.49]Buy- just buy one.
[285:16.77]What is it telling me to click on?
[285:17.91]There was nothing here.
[285:18.67]Huh?
[285:23.30]Fuck, the last one's in here.
[285:24.88]Got it.
[285:27.60]Now what?
[285:28.26]I have to do this.
[286:11.30]How do I get back to the fridge?
[286:15.70]It had to be done.
[286:21.30]I'm sorry, that had to be done.
[286:24.05]It did.
[286:24.31]We were trapped in that one.
[286:29.91]That was very fun, but we were stuck there.
[286:44.54]I know it was the only one that we liked, but we gotta get through them.
[286:52.22]What was that called?
[286:52.76]A hunt for treasure.
[286:57.95]Finish it another stream.
[287:02.21]I might just open it up one day.
[287:06.99]Alright, next.
[287:08.03]What's the Tahiti hidden pearls
[287:12.29]is the one that's right next to it.
[287:14.15]Don't worry guys, you're gonna get to do- we're gonna do it again, because this is absolutely by probably the same company, and it's probably just another version of the- it is, it has to be.
[287:33.53]Okay, uh, this needs to be bigger.
[287:44.48]Alright, let's go.
[287:58.56]The legend of Princess Papith starts a long time ago.
[288:02.74]On a beautiful day, King Palmer went to a magical place that was hidden deep inside the Tahiti Island.
[288:09.26]There he discovered a magical pearl
[288:11.90]It was shining bright like the sun and blue like a clear sky.
[288:16.13]He showed the magical pearl to his daughter, Papith, proudly, who was intrigued by gems and pearls alike.
[288:22.69]The pearl possessed a magical glance, and the kingdom of Tahiti perished in its presence.
[288:28.55]We are in need of your help, traveler.
[288:29.89]In Tahiti, there are many tokens of mystery and magical items to be found that will help you unravel the legend of Papith.

[289:19.31]Since this is your first day, I would like you to get familiar with the surroundings.
[289:21.89]We will go- It's just a hidden object game.
[289:23.64]Hey, listen.
[289:24.36]It seems one of our guests has lost their guitar.
[289:28.38]But I have to get back to the hotel.
[289:30.24]Perhaps you could spot it.
[289:31.54]You get an extra hint.
[289:33.04]Find four hidden pearls in each level.
[289:38.27]I'm not doing that.
[289:42.10]If you click on the wrong thing, it actually takes control of your computer.
[289:56.81]This bike!
[289:57.93]I didn't even click on a bike!
[290:17.36]I don't want to do it.
[290:18.22]We just did that.
[290:19.34]Too bad.
[290:25.50]Seek and find collection two.
[290:29.90]It's going to be a piece of shit just like the first one, so don't worry.
[290:33.04]Not going to be missing much.
[290:33.98]This one is paint.
[290:36.02]Sewing shop.
[290:36.68]Kids at play.
[290:38.70]Let's do kids at play mirror.
[290:54.28]Wait, wait, wait a second.
[290:55.98]Wait a second.
[290:59.02]What in the name of... What does the regular image look like?
[291:18.88]What is this?
[291:25.68]So this is scary.
[291:47.81]In one image, one of these kids is missing.
[292:09.71]The whole lot wrong with that that was there was something wrong there.
[292:13.51]I don't want to play that one So where are we we have?
[292:24.08]Super staircase invaders
[292:30.99]star cosmic invaders sorry let me get that right let me help you guys here it's just terrible space invaders and it's so loud
[293:01.49]I gotta beat one level.
[293:03.91]And then I'll be proud of myself and happy and done.
[293:14.17]What's the big turtle ship dropping?
[293:32.26]You can't play that for more than 30 seconds.
[293:34.32]I don't think you can.
[293:39.84]So then we got Star... It's by the same company.
[293:42.33]Star Cosmic Invaders, Star Cosmic Bustout.
[293:52.19]Star Cosmic Bustout does not open.
[294:00.39]How do you have one working, not the other?
[294:02.51]I don't know.
[294:04.79]That seems impossible.
[294:09.80]So what is left?
[294:12.62]Let's do a little bit of a tally here.
[294:16.28]We've got... One, two... Three... Four...
[294:33.64]5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 14 remaining.
[294:42.67]Only 14 remain.
[294:47.73]Except for these.
[294:52.89]Now, I'm going to give you guys a little bit of an insight here.
[294:58.87]Two of these we've already done.
[295:01.02]But there's not much in here, trust me.
[295:05.70]None of these are worth opening.
[295:11.40]Going from top to bottom.
[295:15.68]This one is just Zuma, but like 500 levels.
[295:20.12]This one is just a Zuma again, but with like 1,000 levels.
[295:23.62]This is also Zuma, but like 20,000 levels.
[295:27.53]This is just Mahjong.
[295:29.45]Again, there's like a hundred levels in Mahjong.
[295:32.72]This is... I'll do this one.
[295:34.18]This is super crossword games.
[295:35.46]That's kind of interesting.
[295:37.76]Uh, like chess brain teasers.
[295:39.56]There's a hundred thousand of them.
[295:40.74]They're stupid.
[295:41.62]Why do I want to do that?
[295:44.06]Mahjong chess solitaire.
[295:46.80]Solitaire, solitaire, solitaire, solitaire.
[295:51.29]Some of these aren't even worth opening.
[295:56.60]2002 games is like, okay, maybe we'll click that one.
[296:04.42]Giving an excuse.
[296:05.48]Well, I'm just saying, let's just see where we are when we get done with these.
[296:10.18]We still have 14 of these.
[296:16.74]You have to at least open them.
[296:17.98]I will.
[296:19.12]Each one of those is getting 30 seconds.
[296:21.68]I'm serious.
[296:27.20]So that leaves us with... Let's start the countdown here.
[296:30.82]Well, not yet, because we're at 14.
[296:31.68]We're looking for... Down here in the lower left.
[296:37.45]Let's get some of these done.
[296:40.17]Volcanic Blocks.
[296:48.04]The game is being optimized for quick download.
[296:49.98]This happens only at the first game start.
[296:56.47]What was it downloading?
[296:57.29]I already have it installed.
[297:06.10]Virus.
[297:17.29]Uh, full screen.
[297:18.17]Let's get it off full screen.
[297:24.37]It is 3D.
[297:35.22]uh I think this is a 3D version of mahjong alright play oh okay uh to throw a rune click left mouse button
[298:03.64]You can only throw a rune when there's another rune in the way.
[298:08.56]Combine three or more runes of the same color to destroy them.
[298:13.24]Your task is to destroy all kinds of runes.
[298:23.15]Yeah, it's just Zuma.
[298:24.13]I told you.
[298:24.85]We're at the point of the 700,000 games where every game is now Zuma.
[298:30.73]All of them.
[298:33.20]Just different versions.
[298:33.96]30, 340.
[298:38.21]Best throw.
[298:39.71]Cool.
[298:56.49]We should just end this with Skate 3.
[298:59.11]I'm not gonna play Skate 3.
[299:01.26]What are you talking about?
[299:02.18]I don't even- I don't even have an Xbox here.
[299:07.22]A Skate 3.
[299:07.88]How do I go up?
[299:12.76]I don't think I can.
[299:22.07]What did I say, 30 seconds?
[299:24.48]How long has it been?
[299:26.43]20?
[299:28.39]Spam this chip to help... What?
[299:33.09]What the hell is that?
[299:43.01]It's a PS3 version.
[299:44.34]I don't...
[300:02.01]What the fuck was this called?
[300:09.34]Volcanic blocks.
[300:10.96]And right above that, flowers in bloom.
[300:14.34]Check it out.
[300:17.22]What is this spam here?
[300:18.60]What does that mean?
[300:19.22]Does everyone want to enlighten me here?
[300:33.74]He said yesterday this would take 30 minutes.
[300:35.32]Can you imagine if I had kept going yesterday?
[300:37.02]If I had continued to play?
[300:41.70]Because that was seven and a half hours.
[300:43.57]So you're talking seven and a half.
[301:05.93]Yeah, that would have been... That would have been like a 13, almost 13 to 14 hours.
[301:10.80]Like going on, essentially, because it's been 5, right?
[301:15.40]12?
[301:18.74]Flowers in bloom.
[301:21.10]Let's check this one out.
[301:27.63]Hello, sweetheart.
[301:28.43]I want a trip to Paris.
[301:29.61]Imagine that.
[301:31.15]Are you going there alone?
[301:34.29]Yes, it's a trip for one.
[301:36.69]But what about me?
[301:39.47]But honey, it's only for one month.
[301:42.69]No, I miss you too much, but I can't pass up this opportunity.
[301:46.24]I won't let you go, but honey, please.
[301:49.78]No, you can't go alone.
[301:50.88]I will.
[301:51.28]I don't need your permission.
[301:52.40]What the fuck is happening?
[301:57.44]I...
[302:00.49]I reacted horribly.
[302:01.49]I need to do something special.
[302:03.29]I could decorate her house with flowers.
[302:04.71]I have time to arrange everything before she returns.
[302:07.41]Why would you put them on the roof?
[302:15.84]You have a month to trash her house and ruin it and put flowers all in places they're not... What wonderful weather.
[302:22.69]This day seems ready made for work.
[302:29.96]What was that sequence in the beginning?
[302:41.77]Who cares?
[302:44.49]The image of the house... It's like... It's not a gingerbread house.
[302:53.05]That's how it was being treated.
[303:01.75]You have a month.
[303:02.77]You're gonna spend a month fucking up somebody's house?
[303:07.16]She's gonna come back and be like, um... Can you... Can you do leave?
[303:19.87]I gotta... Hold on.
[303:20.49]I gotta complete level one.
[303:21.61]I gotta see if there's some more lore.
[303:22.87]Because that was just a tease of lore.
[303:29.15]Is there anything else?
[303:40.77]Do I get to decorate the house?
[303:42.83]That's important to know.
[303:54.61]I'm making good progress.
[303:56.45]If I keep doing this well, everything will be ready for my girlfriend's return.
[304:00.21]Click on the highlighted plant to decorate the place you'd like to most.
[304:11.29]I ordered these plants from the botanical garden for my girlfriend.
[304:15.58]No one in the city will have more flowers.
[304:19.96]Honey, why the fuck did you put them on the roof?
[304:26.78]That's it.
[304:27.12]I don't even want to see it.
[304:29.33]I just needed to know.
[304:34.49]That was called Flowers in Bloom.
[304:37.47]And right next to that is Deep Sea Marble Pup.
[304:42.81]But what happens next?
[304:46.44]I have no idea.
[304:59.38]Can you go more than that?
[305:00.48]Come on.
[305:13.37]Screen is fucked, though.
[305:14.47]Screen is fucked every time.
[305:17.84]Each one of these is a separate game that opens in a separate window that opens its own separate game options.
[305:24.90]And there are 700,000 of them.
[305:32.69]Fuck hints.
[305:33.67]Let's go.
[305:36.29]Classic.
[305:39.02]That's the most roundabout way to get from here to there.
[305:42.22]I don't even know where we start.
[305:44.30]Where's the end?
[305:46.30]Is this the start?
[305:47.50]So, we... Okay.
[305:52.20]Zuma?
[305:52.90]Yes, it is.
[305:53.38]I told you.
[305:55.56]Yeah, it's Zuma.
[305:58.32]That fish just died.
[306:23.32]What else we got?
[306:24.18]Power pipes are right here.
[306:42.74]Yes, I'd like to use my GTX 1080 video sync.
[306:46.52]I don't even know what the fuck is going to happen when I press play.
[306:57.05]GTX 1080 leaked.
[307:00.77]What's fucking happening?
[307:02.17]Wait, wait, wait.
[307:03.25]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[307:04.53]We need to- I gotta... Back?
[307:05.49]This is important.
[307:25.00]We need to turn the music down.
[307:25.82]I wanna hear this guy, everything he says.
[307:27.32]I gotta drag this down a little bit.
[307:33.37]You let me know when it's in a good spot.
[307:40.55]It's gotta be bigger.
[307:44.76]Bigger and a little bit to the top right.
[307:47.68]So I'd say like that much bigger and then like up there.
[307:50.56]Let's give that a go.
[307:56.32]That's not even fucking close, apparently.
[307:58.04]It's gotta come down.
[307:58.96]I mean, that's... I can fix it one more time.
[308:27.11]This should be good.
[308:29.05]Got it.
[308:29.35]Perfect.
[308:29.67]Okay.
[308:30.85]Color on or color off?
[308:39.29]That's cursor.
[308:40.31]It's not color on and off.
[308:43.91]Alright, let's go.
[308:48.87]Action.
[308:49.25]Time trial.
[308:49.95]Action.
[308:52.95]It's just... Okay, buddy.
[308:56.25]Listen up.
[308:57.17]We have only two batteries.
[308:58.93]You have to charge up the left one while the right battery feeds the city.
[309:03.28]To do this, connect both sides of the playing field by wires.
[309:07.80]Then, I'll swap the batteries.
[309:10.40]But be careful.
[309:11.50]If the clips fill up the playing field, oh, you will lose.
[309:46.99]Incoming airball.
[309:52.25]Airball two, sorry, airball two.
[309:54.11]No, no, no, come on, that hurt my head.
[310:35.36]Alright, this is called Air Ball 2.
[310:36.64]I'm ready.
[310:38.30]New game.
[310:39.76]This one.
[310:41.14]I've already played this one, it's just another version of the same exact game.
[310:43.94]No, it is the same game, isn't it?
[310:49.86]Is there a difference?
[310:52.80]Size minus.
[310:57.38]If I can get it up there, that'd be actually pretty awesome.
[311:01.13]Try to get it in the corner.
[311:10.54]You know, you sneak it up there.
[311:11.68]Get it stuck.
[311:17.10]Get it stuck in there.
[311:18.06]Come on.
[311:18.58]Get in there and get stuck.
[311:20.62]That was a horrible noise.
[311:39.67]Get stuck.
[311:43.38]Get stuck.
[311:52.32]Rare loot.
[311:54.46]That was so distracting, it just made me almost lose.
[311:56.52]Give me the bonus.
[311:59.42]Rocket?
[312:06.76]Holy shit, look at all that loot.
[312:11.93]Magnet?
[312:13.63]Powerball?
[312:28.10]Extra score.
[312:28.84]Alright, I'm gonna try to do this with my eyes closed.
[312:35.28]Ready?
[312:48.16]I got it.
[312:48.46]Let me try to do it with my eyes closed again.
[313:00.26]You guys don't believe me?
[313:04.58]Fine.
[313:06.24]No, that's not going to work.
[313:09.07]Ready?
[313:09.27]You have to... I have to prove that I do it.
[313:17.48]So here we go, ready?
[313:28.89]I got it!
[313:29.23]I wasn't peaking, I was not peaking.
[313:49.22]Do it with no hands.
[313:50.28]You can't even see the game.
[314:03.43]It's a hundred levels.
[314:29.24]We're in the final ten, aren't we?
[314:33.83]Break ball time travel.
[314:36.47]Let's see it.
[314:37.11]Rapid fire.
[314:44.88]Not going to open?
[314:47.48]Break ball time travel also does not open.
[315:02.27]So what do we got left?
[315:04.25]Uh... Ark Pinball... Wait, we already did Ark-a-Pinball, didn't we?
[315:10.90]Ark-a-Pinball Neo Worlds.
[315:12.84]No, we didn't.
[315:13.32]This one looks terrifying.
[315:21.60]Um... Oh, it's another one.
[315:26.55]It's the same thing.
[315:31.23]It's the same exact thing that we just did.
[315:33.39]This looks like Stardew Valley.
[315:44.90]I can assure you it's not gonna be like Stardew Valley.
[315:59.20]If it is the same thing, it's instantly getting X'd.
[316:08.69]Oh, wait, it looks like it's... It's the same.
[316:18.43]How is this pinball?
[316:41.77]It's a unique take on the breakout genre.
[316:44.39]But who wants a... Who wants a breakout game?
[316:52.67]Is it just because they can make 500 randomly generated levels and say it's 500 different video games?
[317:03.50]I can't think of any person that wants this.
[317:08.98]Not even old people.
[317:09.94]Old people don't play these.
[317:12.78]Your grandmother doesn't give a shit about this kind of game.
[317:15.32]It's too hard for her.
[317:32.63]That little breakdown.
[317:37.07]Where was that?
[317:38.43]Grandma pinball!
[317:52.57]We've got Chinese chess.
[317:55.25]I have no idea how to play this.
[317:57.34]I have no idea.
[318:04.72]I don't know what any of this means.
[318:16.22]Is it the pawns or... Can my cannon shoot his cannon?
[318:36.50]Oh.
[318:50.40]Is there like a kill button?
[318:52.15]What's the kill button?
[319:30.34]Well, we both lost, because, uh, green.
[319:37.83]That is green.
[319:38.39]It looks like black.
[319:42.77]GG.
[319:43.59]Idiot.
[319:52.88]This whole side is almost done.
[319:54.44]We just have Fairy Flower Vines and Vogue Tales.
[320:03.78]Fairy flower vines.
[320:12.71]What the fuck?
[320:15.27]You were holding the controller upside down.
[320:18.10]I hope that was on the screen.
[320:37.98]Match 3 or Zuma-related?
[320:41.48]What do you think?
[320:48.33]Enclosed by mysterious mist, the magic flowerland exists.
[320:53.25]Above the ridge, there's Lumindor, the famous castle made to soar.
[320:59.10]One day, an old prediction said, a day of lightning...
[321:05.60]Minionette.
[321:07.30]An elfin girl will come to land in water Lily's leaf.
[321:11.16]She'll learn the magic of wildlife.
[321:13.38]Will solve new quests like playing the thief.
[321:16.44]The mist will cover the Earth no more and she will enter Laman door.
[321:20.75]And she was born and here she is and here's her fairy mentor Liz.
[321:28.65]What the fuck?
[321:32.65]Yeah, yeah, it's the pipe game again.
[321:34.83]So spicy.
[322:09.09]I'm gonna turn the camera on because this is exactly the position I've been in for like the last two minutes.
[322:30.87]Holy fuck.
[322:32.25]Holy fuck!
[322:33.91]HOLY FUCK!
[322:49.00]Vogue Tales.
[322:57.05]Come on, Vogue Tales, let's go.
[322:58.33]I don't know God all day.
[323:20.81]Yeah, 3D mode is fine.
[323:28.11]I just jump scared myself with my own face because it minimized.
[323:43.70]Too much, too much, too much, too much.
[323:45.58]There we go.
[323:46.12]That looks fine.
[323:47.58]Yeah.
[323:53.53]I thought that just said Hillary.
[323:54.89]No, hi, Gary.
[323:55.77]Okay, play.
[323:59.17]Somewhere in the suburbs.
[324:01.15]I wonder who else remembered.
[324:02.81]Oh, one more present from Grandma.
[324:06.27]Top priority, open on 18th birthday.
[324:09.74]She promised to give me her mastery secrets.
[324:13.12]Oh, well, I'll wait till the morning.
[324:18.30]That night, the dummies woke up from an unusual noise.
[324:22.36]The dummies?
[324:24.40]Holy moly, a robbery!
[324:28.42]Give it back!
[324:31.67]Oh my, the secrets!
[324:32.93]Ron!
[324:34.81]They went to London after them, but where are we going to get money for tickets?
[324:39.01]Wendy!
[324:42.03]Was the guy running out of the house going like, I'll see you in London, you pieces of shit!
[324:50.46]How would they know that?
[325:01.24]Well, now I'm completely broken and the tickets are expensive.
[325:04.06]To work!
[325:07.02]What?
[325:08.08]Let's learn to make clothes.
[325:10.12]Take a pattern sketch from the table.
[325:13.60]And it's one of these walk back and forth, diner dash fucking games.
[325:24.53]Please wait while the sleeves are being steamed.
[325:26.33]You want a green dress.
[325:40.81]Look at the magazine.
[325:41.69]What is on this magazine?
[325:43.11]Did she just eat it?
[325:51.94]She's eating these clothes.
[325:55.23]Excellent.
[325:55.53]You have your first sale.
[325:56.37]Click on the money to take it.
[325:57.41]If you complete the orders quickly, just like now, you'll get a tip.
[326:01.58]$27 tip.
[326:05.78]Throw it out the window.
[326:07.66]You threw the dress in the trash.
[326:08.72]You couldn't just put that on sale?
[326:09.78]Somebody would have bought it.
[326:15.01]Open the store.
[326:17.29]Green dress.
[326:20.63]What a waste of materials.
[326:25.07]And a blue coat.
[326:32.73]That's closer to the uh-oh one that I was talking about before.
[326:40.17]Same lady, you're back.
[326:42.49]Could I have another one of those green dresses again, dear?
[326:50.10]Steam it.
[326:58.73]Oh, marvelous.
[327:33.39]That was... It was... I don't remember.
[327:38.15]What was it called?
[327:41.11]Oh.
[327:41.72]Vogue Tale.
[327:44.80]Uh-oh.
[327:45.52]We are down to the last... Where are we?
[327:49.56]We've got Astro Color Twist.
[327:55.61]And... Okay.
[327:59.63]Astro Color Twists.
[328:05.79]Oh, there's also one more.
[328:06.97]What is it?
[328:07.73]I can't even read what it says.
[328:11.71]Let's see.
[328:12.13]I'll do that one right now.
[328:16.34]That is Lovely Kitchen.

[329:04.08]This is, this is Diner Dash.

[329:08.14]It's just Diner Dash again, but just called something else.
[329:14.03]Hi, my name is Mary.
[329:19.87]I'll tell you an exciting story about myself.
[329:22.49]When I was a child, I dreamed about opening my own restaurant.
[329:25.58]I wanted to become a famous cook.
[329:27.84]I played for hours imagining I'd make tasty dishes in my restaurant and give them to my friends and relatives.
[329:32.88]You would feed your friends sand cakes and you made them have indigestion and you caused them a lot of fucking digestive problems.
[329:39.73]Thanks to my mom, I mastered the basics of cooking.
[329:43.01]It's more sand.
[329:44.93]That's all we eat here, is sand.
[329:48.34]I've grown up and entered the culinary academy for a restaurant tour.
[329:51.28]There's sand under there.
[329:54.67]After graduating the academy, I decided to make my dream come true.
[329:57.65]So I started to look for suitable premises.
[329:59.31]I love this image so much.
[330:11.48]My dream has come true.

[333:10.68]Holiday rush.
[333:12.59]Sounds fun.
[333:15.84]Let's give it a try.
[333:21.28]Duh.
[333:21.40]Rule of thumb, these games are right next to each other, which means it's going to be a reskin of that game, but Christmas time.
[333:35.77]Maginmon?
[333:37.05]Maginmons.
[333:38.97]Yeah, I see it.
[333:40.75]What am I going to do?
[333:41.43]I'm just going to skip it?
[334:08.19]Holiday rush.
[334:09.05]Career or survival?
[334:11.90]Survival.
[334:13.04]I don't get it.
[334:14.30]How do you survive that?
[334:33.01]Another job search.
[334:43.43]Looking for waiter, looking for janitor, looking for salesman.
[334:46.89]It's time to start my own business.
[334:50.07]Something that would be profitable and also make people happy.
[334:52.41]What it could be.
[334:54.25]That's enough.
[334:54.77]I'm tired of working for somebody else.
[334:57.47]These people need a good vacation.
[335:01.36]Oh, a travel agency.
[335:03.24]No sooner said than done.
[335:04.62]Here's my office.
[335:05.56]Well, it's nothing special, but you have to start somewhere, and I'll everyone start working.
[335:11.06]Don't keep the customers waiting.
[335:16.72]Hold on.
[335:18.38]So, Guy...
[335:20.81]Guy is actively talking about how he's looking for a salesman, waiter, like, I don't want to work for somebody else.
[335:27.70]Like, I want to make somebody fucking happy.
[335:30.22]How could I make somebody happy and not be like, ah, shitty boss, work for someone else.
[335:35.10]Get to fucking work and don't keep people waiting.
[335:39.30]You flipped real quickly, man.
[335:40.60]You went through the evil villain arc in less than fucking one panel.
[335:49.36]Welcome to the travel agency.
[335:51.68]It's time to learn the basics of the tourist business.
[335:54.06]Get ready to help our first customers.
[335:55.63]Okay, I will.
[335:59.05]But first, this is too loud.
[336:00.95]Okay.
[336:08.62]This is your first customer.
[336:09.90]Click on her to find out what kind of vacation she wants.
[336:13.78]Please wait while she considers her choices here.
[336:18.53]It's a very odd place to be.
[336:19.87]She wants a resort tour.
[336:20.93]Now take the blank paper sheet from the stand and give it to a worker responsible for resort tours.
[336:29.69]Wait until she completes her work while you stand there.
[336:32.58]Oh, she's just angry.
[336:33.78]Look at how fucking mad they are already.
[336:38.46]This is a hellish work environment, apparently.
[336:40.54]What the fuck was that?
[336:46.52]After receiving his order, now take the customer's order.
[336:50.65]If you pick up the incorrect item, you can dump it into a trash can.
[337:03.46]What did I do wrong?
[337:04.20]Oh the paper, right.
[337:56.77]It's $420.
[337:57.69]Excellent work, Chittyleg.
[337:58.63]This is guaranteed.
[338:03.28]New service discount tours.
[338:04.96]And it's just another desk.
[338:07.32]My whole computer just locked up.
[338:08.74]Hopefully we're still live.
[338:14.99]We are.
[338:15.29]Okay, good.
[338:19.99]That was Holiday Rush.
[338:22.56]I don't know why that's not called travel rush or agency rush.
[338:27.00]Why holiday?
[338:27.96]Well, holiday is English.
[338:30.83]It's a European term for going on vacation, right?
[338:32.97]I thought it was going to be like Christmas presents.
[338:38.71]Alright.
[338:39.25]That leaves us with only one or two that remain.
[338:51.05]Astro color twist.
[338:52.92]But that's all, hold on a minute here.
[338:54.58]That's also, that's part of this.
[338:57.13]So we have magic, magic mons.
[339:02.67]Here we go.
[339:03.25]Everyone's been waiting for this one.
[339:13.07]People have actually been waiting for this one.
[339:42.16]It doesn't open.
[339:49.49]Hold on.
[339:49.75]Let me try a different tactic.
[339:52.57]Let me see if I can do what I can in the folder.
[339:55.89]Every time we try to do this, it doesn't work.
[339:57.23]But maybe the one time for the last one here, it might work.
[340:02.03]I'm willing to give it a shot.
[340:10.02]There it is.
[340:12.54]Let's make sure we got this in full compatibility mode.
[340:17.12]Administrator, it's on.
[340:23.47]We've done this before.
[340:24.27]Let's see, is it gonna work?
[340:28.49]No.
[340:32.77]It's not.
[340:36.31]Sorry.
[340:40.51]Let me hold and change.
[340:41.29]Maybe let me change one thing.
[340:42.69]Hold on.
[340:46.53]What about disable full screen optimizations and reduce color mode and actually I don't want to do that.
[340:55.75]Let's try this.
[340:56.23]Not going to happen.
[341:14.25]I was waiting for so long.
[341:16.49]And just like that, all of the actual video games have been opened, or lack thereof.
[341:25.50]Did the fire crash?
[341:31.44]The fire crashed.
[341:35.06]It's not even running.
[341:42.62]What a journey.
[341:43.12]Thanks everybody for joining me on that journey.
[341:44.86]Now we have a few more to open.
[341:47.16]This one, by the way, is going to be rapid fire.
[341:50.08]Crystal Caverns.
[341:56.01]Crystal Caverns of Amon Ra.
[342:02.55]Astro Color Twist is on this list.
[342:05.93]Don't worry, don't worry.
[342:10.09]Oh, look it.
[342:10.81]It's Zuma.
[342:12.86]Can you believe it?
[342:16.21]Wow.
[342:17.81]I'm glad we opened this one.
[342:20.67]Glad.
[342:21.85]Very glad.
[342:22.73]Very, very glad.
[342:24.01]Let's start.
[342:28.08]Enter your name.
[342:29.86]Dick.
[342:33.32]Okay.
[342:33.94]Zuma.
[342:34.64]Zuma.
[342:35.18]Zuma.
[343:05.31]But this one, can I please just put the X on that one?
[343:08.87]It's the same one.
[343:10.51]It even shows the balls.
[343:12.01]It shows the balls flying down.
[343:13.74]It's the same one.
[343:15.64]You're not gonna let me skip this one?
[343:17.78]I really have to click Dynasty of Egypt.
[343:26.71]This line of the next three or four are all zoomers.
[343:34.44]It's actually the same thing.
[343:36.20]Look, start.
[343:37.30]I wonder what's gonna happen when I press start.
[343:40.00]Oh, enter your name.
[343:42.84]Saint Font.
[343:44.67]Yeah, yup, yup.
[343:45.93]Oh, this one's a little different though.
[343:47.29]This one, take a look.
[343:57.77]Buy Magimons on Amazon.
[344:01.81]If it doesn't work in this game pack, why would it work if I bought it standalone?
[344:09.62]Fuck, I wanted to end this before this happened.
[344:11.28]Okay, good.
[344:12.72]I almost just clicked on the X on OBS.
[344:14.84]I hope you guys understand that.
[344:18.08]I moved my mouse up to click on the X on OBS.
[344:20.34]Just get it on the Wii?
[344:32.93]Let me just look this up.
[344:40.17]Maginmons.
[344:45.90]Maginmons Electronics.
[344:56.71]Everyone unlock the power of the Magidmons.
[344:58.71]In a faraway kingdom live the Magidmons, magic pets that help the good wizards keep the forces of the world in equilibrium.
[345:05.55]But that stability is threatened when a powerful evil sorcerer captures the Magidmons and hides them in his dark catacombs.
[345:12.25]Without their influence, the imbalance of magical energy could tear the whole kingdom apart.
[345:16.30]The great council of wizards has chosen you as their companion.
[345:20.00]Now you must travel deep in the labyrinths of the dark wizard, bring back the mighty Magidmons, and restore the natural balance.
[345:27.13]over 30 levels, there is not one single result under videos for ImagineMons, not even one.
[345:47.09]How is that possible?
[346:03.70]No one on Earth has done this.
[346:06.96]But it's going to be a match-three game.
[346:10.42]We don't know what this is.
[346:11.62]It's going to be match-three, guys.
[346:13.64]It's not going to be anything spectacular.
[346:20.90]Corner the Market.
[346:21.72]Be the world's first Majin Mon's streamer.
[346:26.63]It's a free demo.
[346:38.93]This shit's Zuma.
[346:39.93]Look at it.
[346:40.35]Is this Pac-Man or Zuma?
[346:41.55]I don't want it.
[346:42.01]Look at that.
[346:42.66]Look at the image.
[346:46.34]No, that's a Pac-Man like Zuma game.
[346:48.20]I don't care.
[346:56.50]It's just another Zuma game.
[347:03.62]We have so many other ones to play.
[347:06.90]Oh, Jules and the Nile.
[347:08.70]I remember when I had the Nile River.
[347:11.15]I remember when I went there.
[347:15.03]I've seen it.
[347:18.79]When I got there, as you see, there's these red, orange, and green balls.
[347:49.83]Are you happy that I'm opening all these?
[347:52.87]I missed it.
[347:53.39]Fuck.
[348:00.33]Gives the credits every time.
[348:03.78]You might want to see a doctor.
[348:05.60]Ah, for what?
[348:06.98]What's wrong?
[348:10.22]Mahjong.
[348:10.86]Hexagon Mahjong.
[348:16.36]Actually, I'm looking forward to Super Word Games.
[348:17.96]I feel like that's going to be sick.
[348:31.30]So here are the thousands of games here.

[349:36.08]Magic Mons are a riot.
[349:38.92]It's not going to happen.
[349:39.81]You're going to be so disappointed.
[349:41.21]I'd rather you think it's good.
[349:44.13]So in your mind, it'll always be good.
[349:57.42]This is the part I'm talking about here.

[381:48.96]This is the correct one.
[381:54.69]1, 2, 3 windows.
[381:56.13]Let's go.
[381:56.63]Alien Ship 1.
[382:00.79]The difference is that the rocket is a different image.
[382:04.88]I bet you 100 million dollars that Alien Ship 2 is going to have a different colored ship. 21.
[382:31.61]Oh, no!
[382:32.28]22.
[382:32.30]I don't think it's possible to go past 22.

[382:40.48]23.
[382:40.50]24.

[383:14.12]Just look at the thumbnails.
[383:16.10]Yep.
[383:16.50]That's a different ship.
[383:17.60]That's a different ship.
[383:18.46]That's a different ship.
[383:19.78]That's a different ship.
[383:20.48]This is an alien snipe show.
[383:22.38]Boy, this is gonna be fun.
[383:23.66]No audio either on any of these.
[383:26.66]Instructions.
[383:28.73]The objective of Sniper is to take down as many armed opponents as possible.
[383:32.53]To shoot an enemy, use the mouse to position the crosshair over the enemy, and the left mouse button to fire.
[383:37.93]For each enemy you shoot, you will be awarded 15 points.
[383:41.11]But watch out, the enemy shoots back!
[383:43.65]Your health meter will decrease when you're hit.
[383:44.85]Every 30 enemies killed will progress you to the next level, but be careful every time the level progresses, the enemies get a little bit smarter, and the weapons get a little bit stronger.
[383:51.43]As you play, you will encounter power-ups, health packs, and shields.
[383:56.01]I'm ready.
[384:01.92]this such severe lag here on this mouse.
[384:18.51]Alright, walking forward.
[384:22.02]You'd get an F in a game design class if you fucking presented this.
[384:46.72]I can't do it anymore.
[384:47.80]Oh my god, I deleted everything.
[384:49.78]It's alright, we can get right back into 2002 games.
[384:55.98]Okay, the difference is they're robots.
[384:58.16]They're a different kind of alien.
[384:59.96]They're a different... Animal Herder 1.
[385:02.26]It doesn't escape.
[385:02.86]Which one do you want to play the most?
[385:04.75]Lions, tigers, chickens, and donkeys.
[385:08.95]Cats... Cats, donkeys, and shih tzus.
[385:14.66]foxes bears and hyenas or gorillas or dinosaurs elephants and birds I guess this one move your cursor to herd the animals into their correct pen your cursor will repel the animals so you have to maneuver them from behind
[385:42.17]If all animals are correctly navigated... Okay, I think I get it.
[385:51.75]The first sound... Jesus Christ!
[385:54.55]What was that noise?
[386:00.74]What the fuck is that noise?
[386:04.66]Oh God!
[386:05.30]Okay, they're falling.
[386:06.14]They're falling out off the planet.
[386:13.75]Good try.
[386:14.11]You got six animals, but you left four.
[386:15.77]Because you've got half more of the animals, you can play the next level.
[386:21.41]I don't think I will.
[386:22.98]Asteroid fight.
[386:26.90]There's ten of these.
[386:29.24]I'm going to pick this random one.

[400:27.81]One millisecond?
[400:32.85]Two milliseconds?
[400:36.73]One millisecond should be fine.
[400:37.97]Okay, pick a location.
[400:40.23]Again.
[400:40.49]Start game.
[400:42.75]Ready?
[400:42.99]Here we go.
[400:58.72]It's not gonna register a thousand clicks a second.
[401:02.24]I mean it is!
[401:02.88]Look!
[401:35.15]Switch it to current location And it's on
[401:55.07]It's still too fast.
[401:56.19]How about 200 milliseconds?
[402:02.70]Current location.
[402:03.44]Start.
[402:13.36]500 milliseconds.
[402:19.28]Start.
[402:26.21]Hold it?
[402:26.57]I mean, I am holding it.
[402:36.71]Click type single.
[402:37.73]There's only single or double.
[402:47.92]Click type, there's no hold.
[402:54.58]It doesn't work.
[402:55.78]Repeat.
[402:56.68]Repeat 50,000 times.
[402:58.72]25 milliseconds.
[403:01.54]Single click.
[403:03.85]Current location, start.
[403:23.07]I need a hotkey then.
[403:25.16]Alright, this music's gotta shut the fuck up.
[403:26.74]I can't even handle it right now.
[403:28.30]Hotkey setting.
[403:29.02]Yeah, it's F6.
[403:38.12]So if I hit F6 right here... F6.
[403:44.15]Current location, 25 milliseconds, 50,000 times.
[403:46.23]F6.
[403:46.31]F6.
[404:16.06]Maybe the repeat is too high.
[404:20.32]Use the razor tool.
[404:22.36]Restart the application.
[404:23.90]I mean, it's very clear that we were just doing that correct, like every other time.
[404:40.53]Unplug it.
[404:41.01]Alright, I'm going to try a different auto clicker.
[404:46.27]The game is going to only register hardware clicks.
[404:48.49]It probably doesn't register software clicks.
[404:52.54]That's probably what's happening.
[404:56.28]Different auto-clicker.
[405:00.31]I'll give you a fucking auto-clicker.
[405:06.79]This is for all the fucking Marvels.
[405:55.49]Mouse click to scroll wheel.
[405:59.41]That's not gonna happen.
[406:00.83]Mouse click to scroll wheel.
[406:10.07]But I can't even do that.
[406:16.22]How the fuck do I do that?
[406:32.43]Let me try one.
[406:33.29]Hold on a second.
[406:36.69]Repeat until stopped.
[406:39.05]10 milliseconds.
[406:41.01]Current location.
[406:42.95]Hotkey.
[406:43.73]Make it like fucking D. Or like 6.
[406:46.93]Who cares?
[406:48.01]Just regular 6.
[406:53.24]G. Okay?
[406:55.86]It's currently set to G.
[406:56.90]100 milliseconds.
[407:04.31]Let's open it up.
[407:06.23]This fucking music is going to drive me insane.
[407:15.21]Okay.
[407:19.53]So this is perfect.
[407:23.87]So you're saying get right here.
[407:31.27]Do one millisecond, it works.
[407:34.78]350 milliseconds is perfect.
[407:36.38]I'm gonna just double click type.
[407:43.39]Tab into the game.
[407:54.72]Alt tab into the game, why does that even matter?
[408:00.79]single click it's alright I'm gonna have to tell you right now if everyone's trying to help me this I've been told like six or seven different things minimize the clicker look look Jeremy look let me see what am I looking at here free chili free chili time be the best you win yeah you that's a lie you you cheated do you see how unbelievably fast I was clicking the screen
[408:36.47]Yeah, you watch that clip of me pressing the mouse like 400 times a second.
[408:43.39]Run the clicker as administered.
[408:44.59]Alright, that's it.
[408:45.29]I'm canon.
[408:45.95]That's it.
[408:46.58]I'm out.
[409:04.85]I can't alt back into the game.
[409:06.24]It's clicking.
[409:35.23]Do the online version.
[409:37.07]Okay, let's see.
[409:39.33]Let's see, I wanna find out.
[409:40.18]I'm curious, where's the online version?
[409:45.48]Somebody uploaded a YouTube video of them beating this?
[409:56.08]Yeah, bullshit, good job.
[409:57.57]You have your auto clicker.
[409:58.89]You have auto clickers set up to 500,000 times a second.
[410:04.10]Nobody can fucking do that.
[410:05.34]No human can do that.
[410:06.24]I was trying to beat it as a human.
[410:09.94]And look, you can't even hear it.
[410:13.20]Look at this shit.
[410:15.88]That's bullshit.
[410:22.23]I almost beat it as a fucking human.
[410:28.82]Alright, alright.
[410:29.58]No more fucking around.
[410:30.62]I'm done.
[410:31.64]We are done with this bullshit.
[410:33.07]I'm moving on to the next game.

[414:15.02]At the very end.
[414:15.86]Get out of my way chair.
[414:20.02]I'm doing this shit.
[414:21.16]I'm lying down on the ground right now.

[431:05.35]Got it.
[431:08.97]That other noise threw me off pretty badly.
[431:14.09]So what happened there is, those of you who know Flash, they just went off the stage, kind of, and then had to come back around here, and they were loading up this way into the back from the stage.
[431:24.71]That was very interesting.
[431:27.59]UFO shootout, don't want to play it.

[433:07.91]25 cents?

[433:51.53]And spin it one time.
[434:00.97]Supersloth's 4th of July.
[434:02.59]Supersloth is just the same.
[434:04.15]Everything's the same.
[434:07.51]Bank robbery.
[434:08.19]It's the same clown.
[434:12.24]The same clown!
[434:14.04]Is there anybody that has a differ- is it any- it's always a clown.
[434:16.74]I don't want to open this one.
[434:24.40]This is definitely one of those fucking command prompt ones.
[434:29.45]Guess the color.
[434:30.65]Guess more or less.
[434:38.61]Puzzle and board.
[434:40.56]Jigsaw puzzles.

[435:42.08]Ping pong bounce shooting range.
[435:44.42]What the fuck is this?
[435:46.92]Don't open a command prompt.
[435:48.00]It's shitty enough where it would.
[436:04.47]How is that sports?
[436:07.17]Wacky Bird Hunter.
[436:09.75]Squid Hunter Speedway.
[436:16.34]How?
[436:17.72]Why?
[436:18.14]Look at how many versions of Wacky Bird Hunter.
[436:22.00]There's almost as many Wacky Bird Hunters.
[436:25.30]Oh.
[436:26.80]Uh-oh.
[436:28.60]No, that's not good.
[436:29.50]Uh-oh.
[436:34.66]This is the time where I feel like somebody took over the computer.
[436:38.40]It's like press enter to begin.
[437:10.97]I don't have the mind right now for this.
[437:13.69]I don't.
[437:14.53]This is probably really fun.
[437:15.85]That's it.
[437:27.35]1,001 tangrams.
[437:32.51]Does it open?
[437:34.33]It does.
[437:37.75]Oh, it's just, I don't want to do that.
[437:42.98]That's pretty much the end.
[437:48.18]It's taken us more than 14 hours to go through this shit.
[437:56.22]We're so close.
[437:59.02]We've got... I don't know what pentaminos are.
[438:02.82]But there's 2,000 of them here.
[438:09.37]Okay, it's just like Windows DOS...
[438:14.38]3.1.
[438:15.42]Archaic.
[438:16.38]No.
[438:17.68]Not doing that one either.
[438:18.49]500 solitary games.
[438:24.70]We already know I'm going to skip this one immediately.
[438:33.28]mini golf I know I know I don't know how to play solitaire so I'm gonna take it I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you guys what I think solitaire is and you can tell I'm gonna chat's turning off I'm not looking at chat solitaire is you have a series of rows right columns and you have to put uh down or up for like a suite right a suite suit what denomination so if it's king
[439:00.24]You need to put a queen, a Jack, or a 10 that's gonna go down in the line like this.
[439:05.72]So I don't have anything, so I have to flip over here.
[439:07.68]So 10, nine, right?
[439:10.74]10, nine, eight.
[439:13.04]Then you can move this one over here.
[439:17.51]So then I have, now I need a seven or I need a Jack.
[439:22.09]There's an eight.
[439:23.49]That doesn't help me though.
[439:25.49]I got a six here.
[439:26.49]I can go five, six.
[439:33.87]You go down or up, right?
[439:35.63]And suits match.
[439:42.73]You can hold so I can go king.
[439:45.64]There's a seven.
[439:49.68]I got my seven.
[439:50.48]That's what I needed.
[440:05.41]Puzzle board champion.
[440:10.20]Alright.
[440:10.68]You guys, come on.
[440:11.30]Give me a little bit of slack here, guys.
[440:14.04]I just clicked my mouse maybe four to five hundred thousand times.
[440:23.24]I got to get a little bit of slack here.
[440:25.75]Queens, chess, wars, bingo, battleship, knight, checkers.
[440:31.34]Reversi jigsaw turns.
[440:33.32]What is what's battleship?
[440:34.88]I know battleship No, you don't know tokens there's no tokens If there are no tokens, this is bullshit Well, it doesn't even load so well, maybe it does I Mean it no, then you don't have a graphics.
[440:58.84]Oh
[441:04.34]Just the lines.
[441:10.50]What the hell was that?
[441:11.08]That was puzzle and board.
[441:13.75]Crystal mazes.
[441:14.79]Actually, this one... I'm actually intrigued with what crystal mazes would be.
[441:21.19]What is a crystal maze?
[441:31.94]Uh...
[442:07.50]Was I supposed to put them into the gold?
[442:11.70]Is that what it was?
[442:18.61]Kakuro games?
[442:19.87]I don't know what Kakuro is.
[442:29.03]Wait, what did somebody say?
[442:31.37]What did somebody say?
[442:37.12]I'm seeing somebody being quoted and tell how funny that was.
[442:39.38]What did you say?
[442:41.48]What did they say?
[442:51.84]... ...
[443:21.39]I've actually seen those before and that they're interesting.
[443:38.31]I mean like Picross or GTFO as the kids say, right?
[443:45.89]I'm a big fan of Picross.
[443:53.84]Japanese crosswords.
[443:58.32]And I think, I think we got ourselves exactly what I wanted.
[444:05.75]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[444:08.43]It has to be the... Yeah, this is Picross right here.
[444:11.78]I could sit here all day and do this.
[444:15.52]This is Picross.
[444:20.58]It's this.
[444:21.20]I can't believe it.
[444:22.04]This is great.
[444:22.64]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[444:23.20]Third of the whole thing is 13.
[444:24.54]It's got to be at least the middle.
[444:32.09]Got to be in here too.
[444:33.11]So this is 12, 12.
[444:35.50]It's kind of hard to gauge that.
[444:38.74]9, 8, 3.
[444:38.82]That's the only one.
[444:39.68]So we can go like this.
[444:44.32]There's two here.
[444:46.18]So it's either going to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[444:47.65]That's exactly what it is.
[444:49.03]So now we can cross these out.
[444:58.41]So I'll give you a quick little rundown.
[445:01.42]I love these.
[445:02.36]I do these all the time.
[445:04.18]I had two of these for my Nintendo DS a long time ago.
[445:07.18]So essentially, Picross is you make a picture, and you're given a bunch of numbers on the edges and the top.
[445:15.37]And what you're supposed to do is, whatever the number is on the left side, that's how many filled-in squares are in this area here, in this row.
[445:25.41]It doesn't tell you where, they just, hey, 12 of these are filled in.
[445:29.49]Hey, 10 of these are filled in.
[445:30.90]You have to figure out with logic and your mind where they go.
[445:36.44]Also, you know, what's going on with the eight and the two here?
[445:38.68]What is that?
[445:39.16]What the heck is this?
[445:40.20]That means that there is a space between these two.
[445:42.52]So for instance, let's say the eight was here.
[445:44.86]So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or because it's here, let's just do it this way.
[445:50.72]Let's say it was one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[445:54.89]This, too, has to be at least one space over.
[445:58.17]That's what that means.
[446:01.19]So, that means that there's a space.
[446:05.09]Sounds real?
[446:05.66]Oh, it is real.
[446:06.54]This is one of my favorite damn things in the world.
[446:11.28]So, 13 was easy because it was... There are 13 spaces, so it has to be 13.
[446:19.93]So, where it gets tricky... So, this is 3.
[446:21.23]So...
[446:24.08]here's the thing, because it's 3 here, it could be here, or it could also be here.
[446:29.62]There's really no way for me to know that right this second, because this row is also 3, so it would have to be, let's say if the 3 was this way, it would have to be 1, 2, 3, which would fuck this whole row up, so it is not there.
[446:42.44]That is not where that is, I'm going to go ahead and put an X right here, because I know that this is just a 3.
[446:48.04]Nothing else is here besides a 2.
[446:50.50]And 3 is in the end, so this whole side is gone.
[446:58.09]because it's two, space, and then three.
[447:00.27]Therefore, there can't be anything here.
[447:08.18]So it's like Minesweeper, but better, yes.
[447:10.62]Way better, in my opinion.
[447:12.90]It's actually kind of cool.
[447:13.86]It is very cool.
[447:14.80]Some Picrosses are hundreds of squares, and they have insanely elaborate, it's not just, oh, a starfish.
[447:25.23]It's like a whole picture.
[447:28.51]they're awesome but I mean I don't I don't know I want to bore everybody and do it because I'll just sit here no fun allowed this sounds sweet it is so we've got five I'll do it fine so five this row has to have five and there are two here so uh there's
[447:53.38]It's very possible this could be down here 5, because we've got 4, but then space 1, 2.
[447:57.50]This might be part of the 8.
[447:59.98]So if this is part of the 8, which it is, I mean 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, it has to go this way.
[448:06.92]Has to.
[448:09.04]Because I don't think there's any possible way that you could have the 8 go this way without the 2 getting screwed up there.
[448:16.39]It's really easy to count.
[448:17.89]So there's 13 spaces, right?
[448:19.41]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[448:20.03]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[448:20.83]Like, they have to be here.
[448:22.03]At least.
[448:22.35]Fill a random square.
[448:24.96]So this is 12, but remember this is 3 down here, so you have to be careful.
[448:47.69]5 and then 4.
[448:48.49]This could be the 4.
[448:50.21]It's definitely the 4.
[448:53.19]3.
[448:53.27]Again, this is just 3.
[448:54.17]We can mark these.
[448:56.59]Nothing in here.
[448:58.49]And nothing here.
[449:01.97]Because it has to be either one way or the other.
[449:05.65]So that we can keep deducing.
[449:07.27]It's all about deduction.
[449:10.05]So that way, 6.
[449:10.59]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[449:10.91]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[449:11.15]Can't really tell at this moment.
[449:21.00]So I bet you it's going to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[449:25.88]So that would be the 3 there, and it kind of makes sense.
[449:30.20]I'm going to go for it.
[449:31.62]So then this is 3.
[449:32.34]There has to be a space.
[449:34.51]3 is actually the end, so there has to be a space here.
[449:39.11]2 in the top row, so there can't be anything there.
[449:49.29]So we got three, somewhere there's a one.
[449:53.23]So six, therefore, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[449:56.51]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[449:58.16]It's kind of tricky, but I'm pretty sure you can go like this, because that would be one, two, three, four, five, six.
[450:04.52]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[450:06.50]So they have to be in the middle here somewhere.
[450:10.06]So that means this is part of the eight as well.
[450:15.63]That looks good.
[450:17.95]I don't know where the 1 is.
[450:18.73]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[450:19.91]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[450:20.47]Very possible.
[450:21.07]Has voted to play this game for one hour.
[450:22.51]What?
[450:49.27]Do a full Picross stream one day.
[450:50.85]It would be fun to start off slow.
[450:57.07]That would be kind of fun.
[451:00.81]Nine, six.
[451:01.81]Just depends.
[451:02.53]Because this six is part of the eight.
[451:05.38]This is three.
[451:06.04]One, two, three.
[451:06.94]Space.
[451:07.46]One, two, three.
[451:08.32]Not quite.
[451:09.62]It has to be... Okay.
[451:11.76]So, yeah.
[451:12.46]So, there we go.
[451:12.92]There it is.
[451:14.12]There's your six right there.
[451:16.40]Six is done.
[451:17.00]I like how...
[451:19.58]A lot of Picross games, when you actually fill a row or a column, it will gray out the number, so you're not looking at it.
[451:26.80]I wish this did it too, but this is kind of one of the more bare-bones Picross games I've seen.
[451:34.89]I mean, I've seen quite a few.
[451:38.47]So again, three, we've got two positions here.
[451:43.33]This could be four, and that would be one, two, three, four, five.
[451:46.03]It could be like this.
[451:50.10]It might be.
[451:53.98]What a gamer.
[451:55.72]No, this is just relaxing stuff.
[451:57.23]I just used to sit here and play these all the time.
[452:01.81]So this is three and then two, which it could be one, two here.
[452:07.33]This feels like a joke.
[452:15.40]It's not a joke.
[452:17.32]So there has to be two.
[452:21.66]Therefore, no, this is done, so you just mark this.
[452:28.40]This is so relaxing.
[452:29.50]I mean, at some point you have to make a good educated guess.
[452:37.46]So let's just say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[452:38.74]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[452:39.04]I'm already kind of pushing it.
[452:39.96]3, it's probably this.
[452:50.14]But it might be the bottom.
[452:51.56]No, but 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[452:53.56]I don't know about that.
[453:01.78]What about over here?
[453:02.54]1 and 3 and 9 and 12, 8 and 2.
[453:05.64]5 and then, well, it could be here because that would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and then 1, 2, 3, 4.
[453:13.18]Let's just see what that looks like.
[453:22.57]Therefore... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[453:30.99]Oh, shit.
[453:31.37]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[453:31.61]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[453:31.73]Alright, alright, alright.
[453:32.64]Hold on.
[453:33.12]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[453:33.64]It has to be here.
[453:34.28]That's 9.
[453:34.62]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 5, 6.
[453:57.08]Starfish Jupiter.
[454:01.80]But which way does this go?
[454:03.00]Because it could go either way.
[454:14.98]It probably is.
[454:15.98]Well, if you take a look at the... Just got her in and confused.
[454:22.73]Ah, I'm just dicking around.
[454:24.76]Well, you know what?
[454:25.62]Here it is.
[454:26.08]It can't go this way.
[454:27.80]There's no 3 can be here, because there's no space.
[454:31.28]So this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[454:33.96]Has to be.
[454:35.94]See?
[454:37.38]The 3, this has to be 3, either up here or down here.
[454:40.12]There's no space.
[454:41.72]That's it.
[454:47.34]Which then, we may have just got ourselves the 1.
[454:55.33]The one might be here.
[454:59.59]It's not that hard.
[455:00.27]No, it's not that hard.
[455:02.01]It just kind of takes a minute to look at it.
[455:07.76]Peacocks?
[455:08.78]Oh, why?
[455:09.08]Did Cox come in and delete some frames?
[455:16.50]Three, two... If that's the case, then...
[455:22.65]one two three four five six seven eight nine it's probably this I'm gonna go for it if I'm wrong I'm wrong because then that would be one two three four five six seven eight I'll be wrong if I need to be which would then be one two one two three space one two three
[455:49.12]Let's see if that fucks anything up.
[455:50.30]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[455:50.85]1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.
[455:51.01]Let's just see.
[455:51.83]Because then that lets... That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[455:53.91]10, 11, 12.
[455:53.97]That's it for this.
[455:54.49]There's 2 somewhere here.
[456:22.60]I think this comes out too because it's the way the image looks here.
[456:26.38]This looks correct.
[456:29.24]So I'm definitely going to need... Let's see.
[456:31.08]No, it has to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[456:32.38]Uh-oh, wait a minute here.
[456:33.24]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[456:33.76]Something's wrong.
[456:34.34]I fucked it up.
[457:00.04]Hmm.
[457:03.42]Restart.
[457:04.30]I don't think I need to restart.
[457:10.84]That'd be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[457:12.08]Let's see if that helps.
[457:13.34]That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[457:17.82]1.
[457:18.00]Well, that's 1.
[457:31.15]I mean, it's a little janky over here, but I can fix it.
[457:37.68]This might be not... No, I think that's correct.
[457:39.62]It might not be.
[457:40.20]It has to be there.
[457:44.62]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[457:45.28]Right?
[457:45.62]It has to be there.
[457:56.38]But that doesn't, no.
[457:58.82]Is it though?
[457:59.83]Because then this would have to be down here.
[458:01.27]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[458:03.41]That's fucking wrong.
[458:10.67]I think that's, I think the 3 column is correct.
[458:19.56]Yeah, it's the perspective.
[458:26.40]Where's the 2?
[458:26.94]The 2 would have to be, like, here.
[458:33.33]Like, here?
[458:41.35]The 9 has 8 filled now?
[458:42.71]Yeah, I know.
[458:43.19]I'm just trying to figure, like, how I fucked this up.
[458:47.81]If the 9 can't be like that, then the 3s must be down there, yeah.
[458:56.19]This is a bad version of this game.
[458:59.17]No, it's just kind of a sloppy version.
[459:02.49]I really like it when you can actually see in real time.
[459:05.49]It helps with being able to see.
[459:07.75]Some of them actually have it so you have, like, two X's.
[459:10.34]You can do a one X that you can actually screw up.
[459:19.08]Threes.
[459:19.52]Yeah, the threes aren't identical.
[459:35.23]maybe like that because then that would be one two three four five six seven eight and then space one two one two three one two one two one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve no that's not right it would have to go it's almost there it's almost done
[460:04.67]The starfish goes like this.
[460:05.99]It's like legs come down like this one So almost like this is wrong Two three row can't be filled with it.
[460:19.30]Yeah Second three
[460:32.48]That'll be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[460:38.72]Hmm.
[460:41.44]These are easy.
[460:42.02]Yeah, I know.
[460:44.40]I haven't done them in a long time, though.
[460:45.72]This is the first time I've done it in probably, like, a couple years.
[460:53.15]Like this.
[460:57.43]No.
[460:59.12]And sometimes when I play these, I mean, I'm obviously very fucking tired.
[461:02.37]My brain is, like, a little slow at the moment.
[461:10.19]Yeah, I could do it if I sat here.
[461:11.97]I know I could.
[461:13.25]And, like, I could do it.
[461:15.53]But... There it is.
[461:17.73]I had it pretty close.
[461:18.97]I don't want to sit here for, like, another 20 minutes.
[461:22.53]It was close.
[461:24.01]I see.
[461:24.51]Right here, yeah.
[461:26.59]I had this right the second time.
[461:30.01]Yeah, it was down here.
[461:30.71]This is what was screwing me up.
[461:34.11]I had it correct before.
[461:36.53]Oh well.
[461:38.34]But no, seriously though, I'll be completely honest.
[461:40.68]Picross nanograms, they are... They are a ton of fun.
[461:46.84]And if you are like, what the fuck are you guys even talking about?
[461:49.83]You can start out with like a tiny cube that is like this big.
[461:58.32]Let's hold on.
[461:58.94]Can I go back?
[462:00.78]Select puzzle.
[462:05.60]As you see here, right?
[462:08.77]They get kind of wild.
[462:17.13]I'm looking for one that's just a tiny one.
[462:23.81]I can't do sort by size?
[462:28.07]That's kind of annoying.
[462:33.12]Size 9 by 30.
[462:35.60]Just looking for like a really small one.
[462:37.24]10 by 20.
[462:42.95]10 by 10 is usually very, very easy.
[462:55.02]5x5 is absolutely impossible to fail.
[462:59.34]But it teaches you how to do it.
[463:03.30]25x10, that's not terrible.
[463:04.89]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, I think this is, yeah, it's 20x20, so.
[463:12.95]You could sit here and, like here, like watch.
[463:16.26]See?
[463:19.64]Do the house tube.
[463:23.99]And this is very... Yeah, and it's zoomed out, too.
[463:29.10]But you're probably looking at this like, oh, that's kind of crappy looking.
[463:31.98]I guess it looks like a fish, kind of.
[463:34.94]There are some very, very elaborate... Especially the one for the DS was awesome.
[463:41.95]If you search Picross in Google, you can get a bunch of 5x5 ones.
[463:45.27]Yeah.
[463:46.67]They're a lot of fun.
[463:48.69]Highly recommend.
[463:50.23]They're good for just hanging out.
[463:53.81]And hey, there you go.
[463:56.57]There's your 1,001 crosswords.
[463:59.83]2,002 space out games.
[464:01.55]I don't want to play it.
[464:02.47]I know what it is.
[464:03.03]I'll open it.
[464:08.43]It's mini golf time.
[464:10.17]Oh, look.
[464:12.98]1,001 space outs.
[464:14.02]We have to go to 1,000.
[464:14.50]Wait, hold on.
[464:18.40]There's more.
[464:18.66]2,002 space out games.
[464:19.32]There's 2,400 of them.
[464:30.19]There's more games on the disk.
[464:46.68]Almost done.
[464:48.80]We're almost done.
[464:50.04]Two days and 15 hours of time.
[464:54.58]I can't fucking believe it's almost done.
[464:58.70]Oh, don't jump the gun that quickly.
[465:01.32]Hold on.
[465:01.68]You got Sudoku Mania.
[465:12.51]Sudoku Mania.
[465:17.27]Doesn't open.
[465:20.70]Gone.
[465:21.56]I knew I should have... Yeah?
[465:27.00]Uh...
[465:28.70]Are you sure about that?
[465:29.58]I don't... Uh, there's nothing open.
[465:36.71]My computer's starting to slow down.
[465:37.87]It's lagging out.
[465:50.09]No, they're multiplying.
[465:51.11]Get them up.
[465:57.68]You gotta cut the head off the snake there.
[466:01.76]Jigsaw!
[466:03.78]3,000 jigsaw puzzles.
[466:11.35]New.
[466:15.29]Oddness.
[466:16.99]Number of tiles.
[466:18.53]Animals 3.
[466:21.47]Animals 3.
[466:21.85]Are there any in here?
[466:36.34]What?
[466:41.74]Porn, porn.
[466:44.52]Okay, I'm not, I can't even open it.
[466:47.61]None of those folders had anything in them.
[466:53.27]You fucking psychos.
[466:56.45]No, no, I'm getting off that immediately.
[466:59.23]1001 mini golf games.
[467:12.64]This is what you waited for.
[467:13.64]You guys waited this long for this stuff.
[467:21.80]Start.
[467:24.04]Where do I want to go?
[467:25.92]More golf courses.
[467:27.18]No, this one's fine.
[467:28.04]Let's play it one.
[467:31.71]Course one.
[467:32.73]Hole one.
[467:44.10]There's a thousand and one levels apparently.
[468:11.06]Albatross.
[468:19.06]This is gonna be fun watch this one full power straight ahead I'm not sure how you did that any better.
[468:30.16]How well, how is that different?
[468:44.49]How was that an albatross Jerma you took forever it was like a par-8 I
[469:01.09]really fans you can't even get a hole-in-one on this game oh
[469:37.25]What?
[469:47.36]Uh, I don't... You can play a better version of the game you just watched right now for free.
[469:55.08]It's like 11 or 12 different websites.
[469:58.97]We already did Mahjong.
[470:00.95]We already opened this one, remember?
[470:04.25]I did actually open that one already.
[470:07.23]Two left.
[470:08.13]We've got the lost mine, a thousand and one treasures.
[470:15.13]The lost memes, somebody said.
[470:18.05]Sorry, I just flashed you.
[470:20.03]Alright, challenge mode.
[470:20.99]This is going to be match three, probably.
[470:22.98]This is a very odd match three.
[470:33.04]We've come down to the end.
[470:38.93]I have opened.
[470:39.49]I've done it again.
[470:44.53]Every single one of these fucking games has been at least attempted to be opened.
[470:52.07]Another Majeule.
[470:54.31]So thanks for everybody for watching this behind the scenes stream three years later for the 700,000 games video because they are all the fucking same.
[471:16.22]End of the stream voice?
[471:17.28]Well, yeah.
[471:18.16]It is.
[471:18.54]It's getting there.
[471:20.30]Eight hours.
[471:20.74]A little more for the bits and the subs.
[471:24.70]This will probably be like a nine or ten hour stream.
[471:31.50]I've had enough.
[471:32.18]Change the background.
[471:32.86]I don't even know what I'm looking at here.
[471:38.86]That one's kinda cool, I like that one.
[471:40.94]No, dumb.
[471:42.16]Dumb.
[471:43.10]Dumb.
[471:44.20]Dumb.
[471:45.48]Dumb.
[471:46.24]Dumb.
[471:47.88]That was kinda cool.
[472:00.05]Astral Color Twist is the final thing to open.
[472:05.88]Let's just see what we have in store for the final click.
[472:16.14]Please play through that museum hunting game with a story later.
[472:22.07]If you guys really think that that was fun, we could come back to some of these that were more elaborate and do them.
[472:31.99]And what do you know?
[472:32.69]700,000 games.
[472:34.93]Here you go.
[472:35.75]Final click.
[472:36.47]It doesn't do anything.
[472:37.45]Astro Color Twist does not even turn on.
[472:41.23]It has been conquered on stream.
[472:44.93]700,000 games.
[472:47.11]Done.
[472:50.63]What a way to end it out.
[472:51.47]Let's take a look.
[472:52.29]Oh yeah.
[472:53.27]Nothing I missed, right?
[472:56.36]That's the same.
[472:57.12]By the way, that is the same Astro Color Twist.
[473:00.10]I just moved it over here because I wanted to have some extra space.
[473:04.41]is there are not two clickable astral color twists.
[473:11.11]Welcome to hell.
[473:20.84]Thank you for joining me, everybody.
[473:24.38]I would call that an adventure that was about 15 hours two days in a row.
[473:29.93]Missed one.
[473:32.59]Middle one.
[473:33.07]What?
[473:35.90]Where?
[473:36.08]What are you talking about?
[473:39.02]What did I miss?
[473:43.10]Middle?
[473:45.88]In the middle.
[473:47.04]No, that's on fire.
[473:48.76]Yeah, that one's on fire.
[473:51.46]That was the gnome one.
[473:55.77]Yeah, that's it.
[473:59.19]The one with no X is the one that's on fire.
[474:03.29]We burnt that one.
[474:07.58]On the left, I don't see any.
[474:10.00]I think we did them all.
[474:12.34]No, we did them all.
[474:16.19]Yeah, I see it.
[474:16.81]We did them all.
[474:19.23]Alright, guys.
[474:19.83]So I will see you again.
[474:23.11]Today is, what is today?
[474:30.14]Today's Friday for me.
[474:32.52]It's probably really late.
[474:35.89]So I'll see you guys again on Saturday, Sunday.
[474:39.73]I'll see you guys on Monday.
[474:44.86]I'm going to take the next couple days off.
[474:49.46]Have a fantastic weekend, everybody.
[474:52.56]Thank you for sitting through this last two streams.
[475:00.98]Was this three days in a row?
[475:02.35]Yeah, it was.
[475:04.78]Because we did the... Did I do three streams three days in a row?
[475:09.00]I think so.
[475:12.18]I had a lot of fun.
[475:12.64]Yeah, we're going to get to the bits and we'll do the subs as well.
[475:17.85]Speaking of subs, www.memersclub just gave five community subs.
[475:29.30]Thank you so much.
[475:32.83]What rating would I give the game?
[475:34.19]A zero.
[475:37.95]A zero.
[475:46.00]10.
[475:49.74]Was this better or worse than the previous one?
[475:52.32]It was the same one.
[475:54.58]There was maybe a half dozen differences.
[476:02.11]Give out the game keys?
[476:03.63]I don't have game... You think I have game keys for gerbil drop?
[476:12.37]This was the patched version from the last one.
[476:16.30]Say something nice about it.
[476:18.02]Okay, I will.
[476:19.78]Um... It's a great time waster.
[476:29.46]How can I say something nice about this?
[476:30.78]Every single game in this entire collection can be found for free and way better online from various websites.
[476:39.89]You can play checkers online with other people in real time.
[476:44.18]You can play chess right now for free against somebody.
[476:47.40]Miniclip exists.
[476:48.98]Newgrounds exists.
[476:52.95]Every single one of them.
[476:53.49]You can play Pool online right now for free.
[476:57.12]You can play Mahjong probably right now for free.
[477:00.60]Hundreds or thousands of different ones.
[477:02.22]Solitaire is for free.
[477:03.32]Solitaire comes free on every computer that's ever been built.
[477:09.89]Jigsaw Puzzles, they're for free.
[477:11.99]You can get them anywhere.
[477:15.49]But can you play Super Frog?
[477:19.05]No, you can't.
[477:20.98]So...
[477:22.61]There were a couple of gems here.
[477:24.65]There was... What's a gem?
[477:26.97]The mystery Chad and Grandpa mansion.
[477:33.16]Use the disk in Monster Rancher.
[477:34.50]I probably will.
[477:35.60]I'm going to hold on to it.
[477:41.96]Now, it's an... Look, anytime a company tries to do something, it's an interesting idea to... Hey, there's 700,000... But...
[477:51.74]I, I... You gotta, you gotta at least... They have to work.
[477:57.57]And if you're gonna sell them, if it's gonna be on store shelves... You could buy this game at, like, fucking Target a couple years ago.
[478:06.13]I mean, if half the games on the disk don't work, at least have the games work.
[478:10.46]And make sure that they work.
[478:15.28]Magic Sphere was really good.
[478:19.11]Um...
[478:23.77]Super Frog, always a pleasure.
[478:31.06]That's it.
[478:38.77]Actually, Jeremy, each level is a game.
[478:40.61]So there are way more than 700,000 games.
[478:47.43]I like the idea.
[478:48.27]I don't like the execution.
[478:51.48]But am I really giving a rating to 700,000 games?
[478:57.00]You can.
[478:57.64]It's timeless.
[478:58.34]It's a classic.
[478:59.72]It's a classic compilation of games that were made probably 20 years ago that somebody kept on a thumb drive.
[479:10.41]And over the years they had a company and they built it up and built it up and just kept putting them on discs.
[479:16.92]Give it a rating.
[479:17.48]1 out of 700,000.
[479:17.86]Uh...
[479:22.39]41 40 ah yeah 410 410. listen hear me out it's a great experience then I had a bunch of fun did you have fun I had fun imagine here imagine a scenario
[479:47.57]First of all, imagine a scenario where this compilation doesn't exist.
[479:53.59]And never existed.
[479:56.28]We wouldn't have gotten the immense joy from fucking around with it.
[480:07.68]And I wouldn't have the immense joy of reinstalling Windows.
[480:13.60]Because that's why I'm taking two days off.
[480:22.83]Anyway, let's get to the bits.
[480:32.36]Thank you so much everybody for participating and watching.
[480:38.42]Next time use a virtual machine, boomer boy.
[480:43.05]I've used virtual machines before and I always have problems with them.
[480:47.05]I'm too much of a boomer.
[480:50.65]But let's go back.
[480:51.41]Let's teleport ourselves back eight plus hours ago.
[480:54.89]See you guys on Monday.
[480:59.30]We'll have some fun on Monday.
[481:01.48]Got some stuff.
[481:02.66]Plus, the date, the 23rd, is coming up.
[481:05.92]So, gotta prepare for that one.
[481:09.10]Hey, one key on thanks for the $1.
[481:10.70]Quick, I need a pancake recipe.
[481:11.96]Two eggs, bowl of flour, bucket of panko breadcrumbs, sugar, maple syrup.
[481:19.26]Use your hands and just get the fuck in there.
[481:22.23]And then that's it.
[481:23.29]And then don't cook that.
[481:24.93]Don't eat it either.
[481:27.11]Don't make any of that.
[481:29.45]Hey, Divas, thanks for the $3, Divas.
[481:33.07]Thank you, Norman Games for the $1 for 30 minutes of Connect 4.
[481:38.95]No, we can play Connect 4 another day.
[481:40.39]It's getting late.
[481:44.40]Hey Barney, thanks for the $1, Barney.
[481:45.98]Thanks for being an... Thanks, Jerma, for being an amazing streamer.
[481:50.46]Thank you, Barney, for your five total dollars, and you say thanks, and you also say pride 100.
[481:54.76]Thank you, Barney.
[481:59.34]BakeMeHome, thanks for $1.
[482:01.59]Lumpo, thanks for $3.
[482:03.11]Congratulations, new subsound.
[482:07.02]I'm not sure what it was, but I'm sure it was... I'm sure it was strange.
[482:11.42]Kitty, uh, skinny time.
[482:13.53]Thanks for the one dollar.
[482:15.29]I'm watching this in the bath and I laughed and dropped my laptop in the water.
[482:19.15]Thank you.
[482:20.03]Be fucking careful with electronics near a big body of water.
[482:28.63]Oh my god.
[482:30.45]Be careful.
[482:33.32]Thank you C4G for the $1.
[482:35.10]Hey Jerma, do you remember that stream?
[482:37.96]Teacher Noise, do you remember what it's from?
[482:39.42]Does anyone in chat have a clip?
[482:43.10]The Teacher Noise stream was one of the last streams I did from Massachusetts.
[482:47.24]I remember because I had one of those bulb microphones that was like right in my mouth.
[482:52.80]It was at some point in late September.
[483:01.49]I'm pretty sure that was- that may have been the last stream or one of the last streams from Massachusetts.
[483:08.16]Hey, it's time for slime.
[483:08.98]Thanks for the one dollar.
[483:10.88]It is the background that we had the image with the slap and the weird glowing eyes face from earlier.
[483:17.77]Thank you.
[483:21.03]That's fucking God.
[483:23.49]Oh, I can't even look at it.
[483:25.89]Norman, thanks again for one dollar.
[483:27.09]Please go to rehab, Jeremy.
[483:30.52]What?
[483:30.82]Why?
[483:32.30]What did I do?
[483:37.82]Thank you, Ocean Gun, for the $10.
[483:40.36]I find myself always looking for your videos on a daily basis.
[483:43.43]And honestly, you're the only streamer I ever watch.
[483:45.93]Thanks for the laughs, and I hope you have a great evening.
[483:48.95]You too.
[483:52.09]Thank you for watching.
[483:53.71]Thanks for hanging out.
[483:56.08]And always looking for my videos on a daily basis that
[483:59.85]That means a lot.
[484:00.33]I don't even know what to say.
[484:02.12]Thank you.
[484:04.24]I'm just glad you enjoy them.
[484:07.44]And thank you again, OceanGun, for the $10.
[484:13.09]YakuSai, thanks for the $1.
[484:14.61]Hey, Gerald.
[484:16.39]Was watching your Marge Simpson stream, Vaude, the other day.
[484:18.95]I was thinking how much I think you'd like Psychonauts.
[484:22.49]I'm sure you would appreciate the humor and charm and think you'd have a lot of fun.
[484:25.44]It's not a brain quiz game, by the way.
[484:30.20]Yeah, I know what Psychonauts is.
[484:31.50]I've seen it.
[484:32.72]I've played pieces of it for like 10 seconds.
[484:38.11]I hope you had fun with the 700,000 viruses, by the way.
[484:40.57]No, they were great.
[484:42.45]It was a lot of fun.
[484:43.39]It was a journey.
[484:46.35]If people didn't think that Psychonauts would be that boring, maybe I would do it.
[484:52.15]Is that something that... Is that a streamable kind of game that people would be engaged in and have fun with?
[484:58.58]I'm all for it.
[485:04.07]I found the teacher clip.
[485:05.71]Oh, there you go.
[485:06.45]Teacher clip is going to the chat.
[485:09.48]I did continue playing.
[485:10.04]I completed the whole game.
[485:10.68]Well, that's not... I mean, the whole game is not real.
[485:12.48]I beat the campaign.
[485:12.92]I went through the whole storyline and a little bit passed it.
[485:35.35]But I don't think I would stream Monster Hunter: World again.
[485:38.67]I got everything I wanted out of it, I think.
[485:41.34]I put at least probably 70 to 100 hours into the game, something like that, over the course of three, four weeks.
[485:50.13]I thought it was fun.
[485:52.23]It was great.
[485:55.29]But I'm not sure I would want to go back and do it all over again.
[486:02.40]What about God of War?
[486:03.90]God of War is one of those games that's on the list currently, still, that I need to play.
[486:09.18]And streaming it is very possible.
[486:13.30]Hey Timmy Tim Tim, thanks for the $1.
[486:14.70]Another poor soul lost to the evils of match three games.
[486:18.05]Wow, just play Slime Rancher.
[486:21.07]That's another one that I've heard is really fun.
[486:24.29]Smelly Boy, thanks for the $1.
[486:25.57]This is a Jex creepypasta.
[486:31.02]Jex Creepypasta.
[486:33.94]Captain Worgen, thanks for $1.
[486:35.80]Jerma NG is more scary than B.F. Bugleberry ever will be.
[486:43.75]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[486:45.19]The Virgin Jerma versus the Chad Daryl.
[486:49.47]What?
[486:51.55]Smelly boy, thanks for the $1.
[486:52.77]This is melting my brain.
[486:56.13]All of them melted my brain.
[486:57.73]I'm pretty brain-melted.
[486:59.15]Honestly, it was the chilly speed clicker.
[487:03.54]That took probably two or three years off my life.
[487:07.38]If I was going to live to be like 140, which, I mean, come on.
[487:11.68]I'm probably going to live to be like 134 now.
[487:19.01]But thank you.
[487:19.85]Thank you FGWGWF for the one dollar.
[487:22.29]Jerma, thank goodness he gave me another chance to live.
[487:24.61]Just whatever you do, don't read this.
[487:29.42]Call back to yesterday.
[487:31.14]Smelly boy, thanks for one dollar.
[487:32.38]Honestly can't tell who's the shittier new character, Jerma Witch or Jerma Goggle.
[487:39.10]So combine them.
[487:40.64]Why can't they be like a Goggle Witch?
[487:46.99]Hey Space Brett, thanks for the $1.
[487:48.45]I played this game like 10 years ago and thought it was just a fever dream.
[487:51.21]Thank you for reviving this memory.
[487:54.79]My pleasure.
[487:56.81]Hey RFLSA, thanks for the $2.
[488:00.41]No message, just cheer 100 twice.
[488:02.28]Thank you.
[488:04.74]Mandum Requiem, thanks for the $1.
[488:07.04]$2 actually, from Mandum.
[488:12.84]Jerma Woggle.
[488:14.78]Goggle Witch.
[488:17.66]Which goggle?
[488:22.40]Memory or... Thank you, Jess, for the $1.
[488:26.48]Can you show us the capacity of your beatboxing talent?
[488:29.54]Maybe when you originally gave this message five hours ago, maybe.
[488:33.68]I'm a little drained right now.
[488:34.64]I'm not sure I could give you a proper performance.
[488:38.11]But I do it from time to time.
[488:40.39]There are people that are way, way better than me at doing that.
[488:44.03]But sometimes it's fun to do.
[488:47.38]Hey, compact viewer, thanks for the $5.
[488:48.94]Hey, it's me again.
[488:50.87]I don't know if you like Star Wars games or not, but I think you should check out Star Wars Republic Commando.
[488:55.99]It's a tactical FPS shooter.
[488:59.73]And he links the trailer.
[489:01.55]Anyway, enjoy the rest of the night and keep being you.
[489:05.92]I will definitely watch the trailer.
[489:07.96]Let me just take a little skim through it now.
[489:13.48]I think I've played this game before.
[489:19.93]I feel like I've played this.
[489:29.98]I think I've... I swear to God, I've played this before.
[489:34.96]I'm not sure I would stream it.
[489:37.24]But... Definitely an older one, right?
[489:41.25]It was 20 when it came out.
[489:43.87]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[489:45.86]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[489:47.40]Thank you for the $5, though, Compact Viewer.
[489:50.16]I do love Star Wars.
[489:51.77]Well, I do.
[489:54.73]I'm not a big fan of Star Wars games, though.
[489:58.33]Maybe, like... I'm trying to think of a Star Wars game that I truly, really, really loved.
[490:07.97]I can't think of one.
[490:12.13]I never played The Force Unleashed.
[490:14.80]Never played the Lego Star Wars games.
[490:16.92]I played a lot of the older ones.
[490:18.03]Bounty Hunter comes to mind.
[490:21.57]I didn't play the Battlefront Star Wars games.
[490:31.82]But thank you, Alec, for the $1.
[490:33.20]Why are you doing a gnome?
[490:35.40]What, am I killing the gnomes?
[490:42.55]Look, the gnome portion of the stream tonight was I was metaphorically putting every gnome that I've had in a gnome circle.
[490:55.65]And then my clicking X fire on the corner of the screen of justice.
[491:10.28]Return of the Jedi Arcade version.
[491:17.38]I've metaphorically killed the gnomes.
[491:25.81]Is the Google Witch in chat now?
[491:28.97]Holy shit.
[491:33.15]That's too many things going on.
[491:41.84]That's a- that's wrong.
[491:44.10]That's all wrong.
[491:47.48]That's a reference- that's a reference to a reference that is also a reference to another reference.
[491:52.79]It's too much.
[491:55.05]At some point, you get lost.
[491:56.01]Uh, thank you UnClean or UnClean for the two dollars.
[492:07.56]It's a YouTube link.
[492:09.36]Let's mute just to make sure this is not a gnome.
[492:13.39]It is.
[492:14.11]It's a... It's a gnome on a phone.
[492:22.35]Uh... What is... Is this recent?
[492:41.83]This feels like recent.
[492:49.76]Did this guy, did somebody like tell this guy that his video was famous and now he's gonna cash the fuck in?
[492:55.60]I don't blame him.
[493:04.57]Oh man, I would be... He's gonna make like 400 million dollars from that gnome phone app.
[493:17.43]Uh, thank you for, uh, phone-gnoming me.
[493:22.35]C4G, thanks for the $1.
[493:23.47]I'm sure you've answered this somewhere.
[493:25.45]But have you played the Spider-Man DLC campaigns yet?
[493:28.59]Or have you considered them for streams?
[493:29.79]I have not.
[493:32.67]I have not considered Spider-Man Return for a stream.
[493:36.55]I don't know.
[493:39.04]Are they good?
[493:39.50]ET phone gnome.
[493:42.34]I was gonna say that, but I didn't... I was afraid we were gonna get minus twos in the chat.
[493:49.18]I was thinking it, and I was gonna say it, but you said it, so therefore you get the -2, not me.
[494:00.50]But I don't have any plans to go back to Spider-Man.
[494:04.10]And I haven't played the campaigns off stream or anything, so.
[494:07.97]Don't think so.
[494:11.23]I am Monk, thanks for one dollar, never stop being you.
[494:20.48]How many more terrifying images of me exist on the internet, I wonder?
[494:28.00]My fucking grandkids are gonna see these, somehow.
[494:35.64]Uh, thank you, the only guy ever for the $1.
[494:39.18]Hey, Elberton, it's me, Chad, member from Trigonometry.
[494:42.44]You didn't show at the high school reunion.
[494:44.44]Now I see why.
[494:45.24]I asked around there and I got word that you make your living playing children's games and making an idiot out of yourself live on camera, so I just had to check myself out.
[494:52.39]Check out for myself.
[494:53.63]Glad to see you're still a loser like you always were, little guy.
[494:56.03]I also remember, uh, just want to let you know that we're engaged and she's chilling with me.
[495:01.60]Later, okay.
[495:08.84]That was four hours ago.
[495:09.92]Where did that come up?
[495:14.96]At what point was that put here?
[495:16.58]I wonder.
[495:16.97]What was I doing?
[495:23.69]I know it's a meme.
[495:24.89]I know it's like a copy Chad pasta.
[495:28.93]But, I mean, I don't even remember when that was.
[495:33.20]Why?
[495:34.72]Oh, my stomach.
[495:37.36]Artium, thank you, Artium, for the $1.
[495:39.14]Yo, check this sick filth out.
[495:42.99]What?
[495:51.09]Mac and...
[496:11.16]Thank you.
[496:12.64]Hey, Dork Cube, 700,000 games.
[496:16.48]It's not your name, but I'm gonna say it because of today.
[496:19.32]Thanks for the $1.90.
[496:19.78]Oh my god, all the photoshopped monstrosities in this game are so good.
[496:27.63]They are.
[496:28.39]They're very good.
[496:30.23]It's probably the best part of the whole compilation.
[496:33.81]Thank you Jen pendulum for the $10 I'm so glad that I get I'm so glad that I get on the stream as soon as Jerma pulled out a troll face Troll face what I?
[496:48.57]Made a contender for the $25 There's no way in hell that that image is going to be an email No way in hell.
[497:00.27]I'm not gonna ever click that image again.
[497:01.73]Oh
[497:05.70]Oh, that one.
[497:11.97]But thank you for... Thank you, Jen Pendulum, for the $10.
[497:14.95]Thank you, Tingy, for the $1.
[497:18.47]Thank you, Jerma, for the $1.
[497:19.31]You're welcome.
[497:22.07]Hey, Ape808, thanks for the $5.
[497:25.32]It's another image.
[497:30.50]My fucking... My grandkids, they're gonna be like, what was wrong...
[497:34.60]With Grandpa Jeremy.
[497:39.00]HeemPixel, thanks for the $1.
[497:40.86]How many of these games do you think will make your best games of 2019 list?
[497:48.12]Probably... nearly zero.
[497:51.86]Nearly zero, because it's possible that one might make it.
[497:55.93]GoldenFoxy, thanks for the $1.
[497:57.05]Hey, Jerma longtime fan, hey, can you unban my other account?
[498:03.52]Uh, you say you were banned for no reason.
[498:08.50]Well, I'll tell you.
[498:10.82]I count bans on the channel.
[498:14.75]Are discussed by the mods.
[498:18.05]People don't get just banned for no reason.
[498:22.57]There's a discussion that goes through about whether or not someone should be actually banned or not.
[498:31.05]So, I don't know.
[498:31.91]I can't just be like, you know what, here!
[498:35.57]Unban!
[498:36.23]I have no idea what the context is, so... Can you unban my mother?
[498:48.43]But, without context, I can't really help you out there.
[498:52.89]But, that's something that you could probably hit a mod up on the channel and figure out what happened.
[499:03.36]Sorry that it happened, but I don't really have any context for you.
[499:07.55]And you'll say, long time fan, how's it going?
[499:09.25]It's going great.
[499:10.37]Hopefully you're doing well as well.
[499:12.61]GoldenFoxy, thank you.
[499:19.30]Hey, Smacklesmore, thanks for the $1.
[499:21.04]Jerma this stream, jermaPluto, jermaJex.
[499:27.33]Accurate.
[499:30.32]Roadhunk, thanks for the $1.
[499:32.56]Himpixel, again, thanks for $1.
[499:34.14]Hope this is enough to pay for the new mouse after eating all those chilies.
[499:38.98]Yeah, I should have been more careful.
[499:43.24]Unclean, thank you for the $1.
[499:44.74]Again, good job beating chili time.
[499:48.99]It was unfair from the start.
[499:51.11]It's the truth of it all.
[499:54.97]RFLSA, thanks for the $1.
[499:56.63]Jerma Hart seems good.
[499:57.81]Thank you.
[500:00.20]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[500:01.56]Literally 2,002 games inside the 700,000 games package.
[500:06.24]That sounds like a good deal.
[500:08.32]Kappa.
[500:11.39]Yeah, there's another box inside of the first box.
[500:15.11]There's 2,000 more boxes inside of that 700,000 box.
[500:16.53]I think.
[500:22.76]Hey, CyanTF2, thanks for the $1.
[500:24.52]I've been drumming for over 10 years, and every single non-drummer that tries to play the exact same beat Jerma ended up doing.
[500:33.68]Well, you're talking about the... Hey, Zeets, thanks for the $1.
[500:47.32]Not quite my tempo, Elbertson.
[500:51.18]Sorry.
[500:52.94]It's time for slime.
[500:53.69]Thanks for the $1.
[500:54.49]Number one chili time streamer.
[500:55.93]And there's an image.
[501:02.09]Uh... What?
[501:06.99]I don't even know where that picture... Where that image is from.
[501:14.38]Thank you, though.
[501:15.12]Thank you, HimPixel, for the $1.
[501:16.46]I can't believe a boomer doesn't know how to play Solitaire.
[501:21.38]Well, you found him.
[501:24.72]Corbiter, thanks for the $1.
[501:26.14]Hey, Jeremiah, I caught a rare glimpse of the ghosts that lurk in your closet last night.
[501:29.19]I'll give you a funny story about that.
[501:32.79]So last night, here's the image.
[501:35.63]Last night I turned my webcam on.
[501:39.77]And everyone kept saying, the closet, the closet, the closet.
[501:43.16]So I was like, oh shit, the closet.
[501:45.02]So I put my phone in the closet with a light on, with the flashlight on facing out, with the BRB screen up.
[501:51.02]And it stayed there.
[501:52.94]Funny story, part two, the phone died up there.
[501:55.91]I forgot about it.
[501:56.57]I think like maybe an hour and a half after I put it up there, the light is off.
[502:01.61]Phone died.
[502:03.71]Fast forward to today.
[502:06.27]Where's my phone?
[502:07.60]Where is it?
[502:16.51]Oh, oh right, I forgot.
[502:19.39]I put it up there last night.
[502:25.65]GG, idiot.
[502:32.69]But thank you, uh, Corbiter.
[502:34.98]Hey, Bet3, thanks for $5.
[502:36.42]It's really fun watching you do P-Cross games like that.
[502:39.62]I like hearing your narration and seeing the picture take form.
[502:41.76]It's just very relaxing.
[502:44.83]Don't be surprised if one day I turn this stream on and I got a really high quality version of that game and we just sit back and just sip on some fucking tea and just play that for like five hours.
[503:00.96]I'll be surprised.
[503:04.50]But thank you for the $5, bet three.
[503:07.20]George Maka, thanks for the $1.
[503:09.26]We have a survivor.
[503:12.24]Jermanius.
[503:13.40]What do you mean Jermanius?
[503:18.91]Nope.
[503:22.02]We have a survivor.
[503:23.36]It was a gnome.
[503:24.74]Hey, Logan.
[503:25.34]Thank you, Logan, for the $5.
[503:26.05]Hey, love you, Jerma.
[503:28.23]Don't know if you saw that or not, but my friends and I cooked coffee and Cheeto-styled chicken.
[503:37.36]Yeah.
[503:38.68]Oh my god.
[503:40.54]The quintessential Jerma joke needed the quintessential meal.
[503:42.92]We made coffee, chicken, and sauce.
[503:45.59]Cheeto chicken and sauce.
[503:46.81]And finally a mixed coffee, cheeto chicken.
[503:48.93]The cheeto chicken was the best by far.
[503:53.29]Oh my fucking lord.
[504:02.58]That's fucking hilarious.
[504:06.22]I love that food network sauce spoon drag that you have in that picture.
[504:14.69]That's high quality shit.
[504:22.47]Good work.
[504:23.97]That's awesome.
[504:25.80]Thank you for the five dollars.
[504:30.02]Golden Foxy, thanks for two dollars again.
[504:31.70]Wait, Jerma, I need to tell you something important.
[504:35.44]And that's it.
[504:38.09]Thank you, GoldenFoxy.
[504:40.15]Hey Train, thanks for the $1 train.
[504:42.63]Just want to say how you've helped me throughout the harsh times.
[504:45.68]I watch your VODs every day when I come back from college and they cheer me up every time.
[504:49.90]Cheers for you and to the chat.
[504:52.12]P.S.
[504:52.54]Please play Dusk.
[504:54.92]Actually, I was going to.
[504:58.39]Yeah, it looks actually pretty fun.
[505:00.65]That's that old school FPS, uh, Doom, uh, Doomer, Boomer, whatever, that's what they call the boomers that play Doom.
[505:14.24]I was definitely, I was checking it out.
[505:18.99]Thank you so much, Train, for the one dollar.
[505:21.67]And... It's my pleasure.
[505:24.21]Thank you.
[505:25.81]Crocky Lemons, thanks for the one dollar.
[505:27.27]I can't wait for the Picross stream, Jeremy.
[505:29.77]Don't be surprised.
[505:31.79]Uh, thank you Jack for the one dollar.
[505:33.17]End the stream by watching the old video.
[505:37.04]The old video.
[505:38.44]Oh, the 700,000 video.
[505:38.84]Um...
[505:42.72]We'll save that for Monday.
[505:44.16]We'll compare the two just because I'm fading here.
[505:47.42]I need to get some food in me.
[505:51.17]The old vid.
[505:53.03]Because that's like a full 10 minute video, right?
[505:56.85]We'll start on Monday by just going very briefly over kind of... I need a couple days to compress from what we just did.
[506:05.18]Are you going to forget?
[506:06.08]I won't forget because I got 700,000 chatters that will remind me
[506:14.03]So don't worry.
[506:14.49]Remind me to do that first thing we do.
[506:20.45]Hey, Genvi, thanks for the $1.
[506:21.91]Is this better than the Ouya?
[506:24.89]Oy, the Ouya.
[506:26.11]I forgot about that.
[506:31.16]Fastest... Just skydive into the ground.
[506:37.88]You know, the funny thing about the Ouya is it's probably going to be worth a shitload of money in like 25 years.
[506:43.47]just because it existed.
[506:47.19]Hey, yes is online.
[506:48.47]Thanks for the $5.
[506:49.42]Yes.
[506:50.50]I went to a bar and got shit-faced and you were still playing the shovelware.
[506:54.00]Any plans on playing the Resident Evil 2 remaster?
[506:56.40]Yes.
[506:57.22]By the way, the storyboards for when my crew shoots with the green screen footage in Boston are almost complete.
[507:01.72]We've got a production company that did a Super Bowl commercial helping.
[507:09.34]Holy shit.
[507:11.16]Uh... That's really, really... That's wild.
[507:17.95]But, Resident Evil 2 Remaster, yes, I'm gonna... Day 1.
[507:21.87]I'll be... I'll be one of the 500 million people streaming that game day 1.
[507:27.49]Just seems like a lot of fun.
[507:28.98]I love Resident Evil 4, I love Resident Evil 5.
[507:33.04]And they're kind of doing that, they're going back and remastering it in that style, except not really, but kind of.
[507:39.12]Third person, over the shoulder.
[507:40.74]I'm sure I'll love it.
[507:43.44]And the demo is already out, that's true.
[507:45.16]But I don't want to play it because I want to experience the whole thing from start to finish.
[507:49.45]And I think giving myself a 30 minute demo would just tease me, so.
[507:57.59]But thank you.
[507:58.47]And yes, expect that on day one.
[508:00.89]Golden Foxy, thanks for the $1.
[508:03.19]Been a fan since 2012.
[508:05.49]I have something important.
[508:11.08]Uh... What is it?
[508:18.26]You say there's something important, but you don't say what the important thing is.
[508:21.60]Is it the band thing?
[508:27.11]Because if it is, I talked about it about 15 minutes ago, maybe.
[508:33.22]Hey, Lars, Bloodaxe, thanks for the $5.
[508:35.06]Google doesn't even sound like a word anymore.
[508:36.86]Good stream.
[508:39.12]Goggle doesn't sound like a word anymore.
[508:41.14]Not Google.
[508:43.10]Goggle.
[508:45.78]If you say a word enough times in a row, it doesn't sound like a real word.
[508:51.05]Hey, Siroc, thanks for the $1.11 like.
[508:53.07]Zoinks, Jerma.
[508:53.71]There's a g-g-g-g-ghost in your closet, man.
[508:55.83]You should, like, call the fire department.
[508:59.04]I sent this at the beginning of the stream, but for whatever reason you... No, it's the voices.
[509:02.46]I don't even need to do it anymore.
[509:03.36]But for whatever reason you missed it, also add Jerma NG as an emote.
[509:11.08]FGWGWF, thanks for the $1.
[509:13.16]I wish some movie studio would just give you a budget and tell you to make whatever the movie you want.
[509:17.56]I feel like that might be the funniest movie ever.
[509:19.56]So I guess I'll put this dollar towards the live-action Death and Life of Harold St.
[509:25.24]Sludge Foundation.
[509:30.23]I mean, I would... If I had a million dollars or like ten million dollars to make a movie...
[509:38.17]I don't even know.
[509:38.65]There's so many things that I would think would be fun to make.
[509:40.49]I don't think I'd even want to make a movie.
[509:43.31]I think I just want to make a series of, like, 25 different videos.
[509:48.33]And just upload them.
[509:50.69]I'm not sure a movie... There are too many things I'd like to do with that money.
[509:57.45]But, thank you.
[510:01.23]GoldenFoxy, thanks for the $1.
[510:02.21]Do you still have your PlayStation 2?
[510:03.79]Yes, I do.
[510:05.15]It's currently in the ghost closet.
[510:08.30]It's ready to go for another night when it's deemed necessary.
[510:14.22]Hey, Trotter, thanks for the $1.
[510:15.52]Saw this in chat a minute ago.
[510:16.66]Thought I'd get your eyes on it.
[510:25.46]Hey, Jeremiah, I'm planning on proposing to my lady friend that I would love to have you officiate the wedding for me and my loved one.
[510:32.97]I'll pay for your licensing and we'll fly to you.
[510:40.79]Is that, is that legal?
[510:41.99]Is that, is that legal for me to do that?
[510:49.65]Officiate a wedding.
[510:51.43]Oh, it would be bad.
[510:52.79]It would be bad.
[510:54.39]I could stand in front of a hundred thousand people and do a bit, but you put me in front of like a couple hundred of your closest friends and family members and I'm officiating your wedding.
[511:07.71]I'm going to turn purple.
[511:13.84]Oh my god, I would- I would- I would- I wouldn't even know what to do!
[511:21.87]That makes it better!
[511:23.25]Oh my god!
[511:28.41]Imagine officiating a wedding and we- I don't- I don't know really either one of the two people.
[511:39.68]We're getting the pre-recorded wedding joke scene.
[511:45.37]It's a perfect stream.
[511:47.31]Oh, God.
[511:56.14]Well, first of all, to answer that, I would really need to really think about that.
[512:05.10]The joke is you don't know anyone.
[512:09.62]A lot of wedding official orators don't know the bride or groom.
[512:19.59]It would be so hard for me to do.
[512:23.52]I could dress up in a clown costume and fucking ride a tricycle across a stage and have 50,000 people in that crowd just pointing and laughing at me.
[512:32.35]But you give me like a bible and stand there at the front with like a bunch of grandmas in the front row.
[512:41.35]I would be very nervous.
[512:51.81]Fly to you come on you coming down to Vegas We are Christians so it would be in a church just want to give you a fair warning Vegas Make sure I like make sure old like grandma Esther is aware that you're in like Las Vegas.
[513:13.08]Oh
[513:23.29]That's fucking... First of all, like, all jokes aside, that's really, really... incredibly, like, humbling and grounding and that somebody would actually want me to do that.
[513:34.12]If it's not just like a joke, if it's for real... That is so... I can't even fucking believe that.
[513:40.25]That is so... That's so un... It's equal parts unbelievable and equal parts... The word I want to say is just interesting.
[513:55.66]Lots of people get married in Vegas, not just shotgun weddings.
[513:57.86]Yeah, I know.
[513:59.16]I'm just kidding around.
[514:04.46]No, grandmas love the slots.
[514:09.75]But seriously, I mean, if that's for real, then I would have to think about that and figure out how I'd want to do that.
[514:14.67]And I'd have to like muster up the courage to be able to do something like that.
[514:29.23]So at the moment, I'm gonna have to think about that, but I'm gonna have to kind of respectfully decline.
[514:36.25]Just for the sake of... I don't know.
[514:40.14]I don't know.
[514:43.26]If the wedding happens, invite chat.
[514:49.91]Waiting for the wedding stream in five months.
[515:01.82]Thank you so much for that message.
[515:03.87]Even if it's not real, then it's not real, and we just spent about 10, 15 straight minutes talking about it.
[515:09.29]And if it is, then that's something I would really have to think about.
[515:16.59]I'm absolutely floored that you would even want that to happen in the first place.
[515:29.53]Thank you, The Jewish Bro, for the $1 to you.
[515:31.51]Keep Kim up with your streams.
[515:33.73]Yeah.
[515:35.85]She watches them sometimes.
[515:44.94]And, you know, when I'm done streaming, she's usually like, oh, how'd it go?
[515:49.28]What'd you do?
[515:50.64]We talk about it for a few minutes and we just kind of move on.
[515:54.14]But yeah.
[515:57.71]Thank you, IkeTurtle, for the $1.
[515:59.21]I made a contender for the $25 sub emote.
[516:02.67]That was the one.
[516:04.50]That was the hot dog in the mouth.
[516:08.76]I'm just going to do this right now just to make sure I show this right now because this will never be an emote.
[516:13.40]I'm never going to have that as an emote.
[516:17.28]Just want everyone to be very aware.
[516:19.61]Get your cameras on.
[516:20.63]Get your snapshot ready because I'm never going to link that again.
[516:31.82]So thank you, Ike Turtle, for the... I'm not even sure what that is.
[516:42.72]But thank you.
[516:45.34]Thievius, thanks for the $5.
[516:46.34]Hey, Jerma, just turned 20.
[516:47.70]It's midnight, and I'm glad I could spend a part of my birthday watching my favorite streamer.
[516:52.44]Being 20 is weird because I don't feel that old, but I'm also excited because it feels like a new chapter in my life has just opened.
[516:58.24]Anyway, keep up the great streams, Jermboy, jermaHeart.
[517:03.53]Yeah, your 20s, 20s from 20 to 30 is an adventure.
[517:09.35]You learn a lot about yourself.
[517:10.77]You learn a lot of your opinions that you had when you were a teenager, kind of mature.
[517:15.06]And you start to craft who you want to be as a person in your 20s.
[517:24.12]Happy birthday.
[517:25.20]If you're still here, hopefully you still are.
[517:27.50]Hope you had a great one.
[517:31.85]And good luck on the next chapter of your life.
[517:38.02]GarfieldTheMondayKiller, thanks for the $1.
[517:39.78]Hey there, Jerma, what a Garfy stream you just did.
[517:42.18]I can't believe that Garfin Garftacular, you know what I mean?
[517:45.62]Odie couldn't believe his eyes, I mean, holy moly guacamole, I'm playing Mario Odyssey with Odie, so I do a very good Garfagraph, haha, but it's still pretty great.
[518:01.63]Alright, Garfield.
[518:03.71]The jig is up here.
[518:06.11]You become self-aware in this paragraph.
[518:08.96]Uh-oh.
[518:10.18]I think it's time is up.
[518:15.94]You broke the fourth wall, Garfield.
[518:26.71]Busted.
[518:33.61]Thank you, The Jewish Bro, again for the $1.
[518:35.23]Have you heard of, uh, Alkis Breach?
[518:40.63]I have not.
[518:41.25]I don't know what it is.
[518:43.09]I don't know what that is.
[518:45.09]So I, there you go.
[518:46.31]I don't know.
[518:48.87]Hey, Creel, thanks for the $1.
[518:50.32]You should play Return of the Obra Dinn.
[518:51.84]It's made by Lucas Pope, the guy that made Papers, Please.
[518:54.70]It's an insurance investigator game at sea with minimal color.
[518:59.60]Yeah, I actually talked about how I was going to stream it three to four days ago.
[519:08.53]It looks really, really interesting.
[519:10.53]And Papers, Please was great too.
[519:15.29]So, that is very possible you might see that.
[519:17.81]I have so many games to play and stream.
[519:19.65]I do.
[519:22.09]But they have to be at the right time.
[519:24.32]I have to be in the right mindset and be ready and want it.
[519:27.80]I can't just do it.
[519:30.32]I can't just stream Return of the Obra Dinn.
[519:32.60]I have to be ready and want it.
[519:36.17]And I don't know when that would be.
[519:37.77]I know it will be some point.
[519:40.97]Didn't know it was made by the Papers, Please guys.
[519:42.61]Oh, yeah.
[519:43.41]Papers, Please guy.
[519:44.11]That was a fantastic game.
[519:51.60]Uh, Kumo Tosen.
[519:52.92]Thanks for the $1.
[519:53.72]Hey, Jermbo.
[519:55.02]I guess I'm going to be a VOD nerd tonight since I fell asleep right before the stream.
[519:58.78]I wanted to know if you'll ever play House Flipper again.
[520:00.58]Those streams are great and the devs are adding a Garden DLC.
[520:05.60]If the Garden DLC is significant enough to do a whole full good stream of that game, then yes.
[520:13.04]If they add enough where I could justify turning the stream on and going through it, then sure.
[520:20.49]I love that game.
[520:24.37]GoldenFoxy, thanks for the $1.
[520:28.69]Uh, the important thing, oh, the important thing, here it is.
[520:32.02]Was the, I have no idea where to go and ask about the band, the mods.
[520:35.56]By the way, have a good night.
[520:37.22]I finally got my grades up before.
[520:39.36]My grades sucked.
[520:41.60]That's too bad.
[520:42.43]I'm sorry to hear that.
[520:45.15]Uh, there are any, if you want to find a mod, they have a sword next to their name.
[520:48.87]And on Discord, they have a purple name.
[520:51.67]That's how you can always tell who a moderator of the channel is.
[520:56.29]Sorry to hear about your grades.
[520:57.59]Hope you do... Hope you... Hope you get them up.
[521:02.09]Take care of yourself.
[521:02.69]Thanks for the multiple.
[521:06.20]You gave at least five to ten dollars tonight.
[521:08.70]Thank you, Golden Foxy.
[521:10.30]Ike Turtle, thanks for the one dollar.
[521:11.42]Here's a dollar.
[521:11.88]Look at this.
[521:12.26]I need to know your thoughts.
[521:18.67]I hate it.
[521:24.22]I hate it.
[521:25.40]I hate that.
[521:26.30]Especially the one on the left.
[521:27.86]I hate both of them.
[521:29.92]Both of those guys look like funny joke YouTubers.
[521:32.34]You know what I mean?
[521:33.76]That's like a joke, I'm a YouTuber thumbnail.
[521:38.66]I hate both those guys.
[521:39.96]I don't want to watch their videos.
[521:47.93]And finally, the Jewish bro, thanks for the $1.
[521:50.73]It's Alchestbreach.
[521:52.13]He's a streamer.
[521:54.40]And we have similar humor.
[521:56.90]I've never watched or haven't really... No, I don't know who it is.
[522:03.92]There are a lot of streamers on Twitch.
[522:12.27]That better be the thumbnail of God...
[522:17.47]But, finally here, thank you, GoldenFoxy, for the one dollar.
[522:20.92]Uh, when I watched this on Movie Night with the green screen, did you really enjoy that video?
[522:24.70]I had a big watermark on there.
[522:26.10]I was gonna ask that, but... That's when I got banned.
[522:29.68]If you did, thanks.
[522:33.43]Oh, well... All the videos that were played during the Movie Night stream were... Were all good.
[522:39.57]They were all worth watching.
[522:42.57]Some of them were incredibly elaborate and had a ton of work put into, but that doesn't mean that the other ones weren't worth watching and weren't fun.
[522:51.93]So, no, absolutely.
[522:54.15]Every single one of those that was on stream was great.
[522:59.79]What are you doing?
[523:00.88]Yeah, I've seen this already.
[523:02.34]I've already seen this image.
[523:05.26]Yes, I know.
[523:05.94]And why did I just paste it?
[523:08.44]It's already here like 30 times.
[523:12.39]I've already seen this fucking image.
[523:15.59]And it's gonna haunt me forever.
[523:16.99]For the rest of my life.
[523:19.47]This is me kissing me.
[523:21.21]Do you understand how odd this is to see this?
[523:25.99]That's so... God.
[523:44.51]Then why did this just pop up again?
[523:47.59]The hot dog thing came up again.
[523:51.26]Why do I have so many of these?
[523:54.42]I'm going down my tabs.
[523:57.70]And there's just fucking hot dogs in my mouth.
[524:00.94]Like six times.
[524:06.78]Does it have to be this many hot dogs?
[524:12.76]Alright.
[524:13.70]Uh, here come the credits.
[524:16.46]Thanks, everybody, for subscribing.
[524:20.28]If you see your name, point it out!
[524:25.49]Much love to you all.
[524:26.27]I'll see you guys all on Monday.
[524:27.53]This is not a hot dog image.
[524:31.55]No, I have, but that was my background for a while.
[524:36.53]Whoa, that's me!
[524:37.91]There, that's me!
[524:45.95]There I am.
[524:50.71]Is there another one?
[525:07.14]You guys are gonna really fuck up my grandkids.
[525:19.27]Just when you think the images can't get any worse they do.
[525:21.53]I don't even know how you guys are this fast.
[525:51.06]How do you do that that quickly?
[525:52.56]It takes me like 30 minutes to make an image like that.
[526:00.29]Oh, my God.
[526:01.01]Hey, Grandpa, what are all these weird pictures of you with hot dogs in your mouth and you eating a hot dog from the other side in a witch costume?
[526:14.22]When did you do this?
[526:16.88]I didn't.
[526:17.62]You see, back when I was
[526:20.58]In my younger years, there were these things called fucking chat memers.
[526:26.59]And what they did is... Oh, he's asleep again.
[526:31.82]Okay.
[526:32.72]Just walk away from Grandpa.
[526:34.51]Let him have his space.
[526:49.88]Don't tell me that happened.
[526:51.56]No, no!
[526:56.21]No, no, no, no!
[526:58.79]Why now?
[526:59.69]Why does this- it's been like three years of links.
[527:20.34]You guys are killing me.
[527:25.97]Thank you, IkeTurtle, for the $1.
[527:27.37]This isn't a hot dog image, but I made it a while back when you found the snake in your room.
[527:41.70]Permaban, that guy.
[527:48.40]You can't...
[527:49.99]Don't make me turn off links.
[527:52.27]I don't want to.
[527:53.75]I don't want to have to have people be- give permission to post something if they think it's fun or relevant or funny.
[527:59.12]Don't make me delete that.
[528:00.32]It's like Strike 2.
[528:04.86]You're better than that.
[528:05.98]You're better than this.
[528:06.86]Don't- you're gonna make me press the button.
[528:14.61]Just delete that Twitch user.
[528:19.17]Why did I repost it?
[528:21.41]What?
[528:25.79]I have seen this before.
[528:37.45]Use your infinity gauntlet.
[528:39.37]It's infinite gauntlet.
[528:40.71]It's not infinity gauntlet.
[528:45.92]But, alright.
[528:46.90]That's it.
[528:47.34]I'm out of here.
[528:49.30]Last, uh, Yebso, thanks for the $1.
[528:51.08]Uh, toast to the end of the worst year of my life.
[528:54.96]Two hospital trips, serotonin syndrome, major depression, and no way to pay for my medications.
[529:00.30]Just had my birthday on the 9th.
[529:02.42]Keep making videos, Jerma.
[529:03.88]Forever in my heart.
[529:06.56]Oh, happy birthday.
[529:07.22]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[529:15.47]I always feel so fucking terrible when people talk about that kind of shit.
[529:18.83]That makes me feel so bad.
[529:21.47]That somebody's having that much a fucking problem, that much trouble.
[529:26.47]I sincerely hope, from the bottom of my fucking heart, that you feel better.
[529:31.96]And that your life can get on the right track.
[529:33.58]I really do.
[529:34.54]Truly.
[529:46.40]Having to deal with all that kind of shit.
[529:52.07]We got a great community here.
[529:54.73]We fuck around a lot, but... I mean, the heart is like solid gold.
[529:59.49]You know, it's like a solid... You could... I mean, that's aluminum, but... It's made out of solid gold.
[530:06.34]I really hope you feel better.
[530:08.30]Take care of yourself.
[530:11.70]Thank you for being a part of this community.
[530:16.52]I appreciate and cherish the fact that you're here.
[530:20.34]And so does, I would assume, everybody else.
[530:23.31]Thank you so much, Yepso.
[530:24.73]Hope you feel better.
[530:31.27]Solid gold aluminum.
[530:32.49]That's right.
[530:36.24]Yepso, 10 bucks from Yepso.
[530:40.78]Right at the end.
[530:41.18]You are too kind and I love you all.
[530:42.80]Thanks, but I'm a tough cookie.
[530:44.20]Good.
[530:46.57]That's really good to hear.
[530:55.41]My heart is made of Dogecoin.
[530:57.91]That's solid gold aluminum.
[530:59.39]That's solid aluminum gold.
[531:02.40]Touch the screen.
[531:05.18]And finally, right at the end, GoldenFoxy, thanks for the one dollar.
[531:08.78]I'm going to bed, but I've got to say something.
[531:10.12]Jerma, thanks for being an amazing person after this message.
[531:12.15]I'm going to sleep.
[531:12.75]Have a great night.
[531:14.85]Maybe see you on Monday.
[531:16.39]P.S.
[531:16.65]Sorry, I'm annoying.
[531:18.67]Also, if I get banned again, I still won't care.
[531:23.50]I don't think you've done anything particularly annoying right now.
[531:26.72]What are you talking about?
[531:30.38]You're good?
[531:32.56]Maybe we'll see you Monday.
[531:34.09]Take care.
[531:37.72]What was the plan for Monday?
[531:39.96]Um... I might actually blow the fucking dust off the Dreamcast.
[531:46.88]And actually get that going for Monday.
[531:49.48]It's possible.
[531:50.44]It's probably gonna like... It's probably gonna not happen.
[531:53.16]But I know if I keep... If I say it enough times, it'll come out of the fucking ghost closet and we'll actually be able to use the damn thing.
[532:05.71]But that is it.
[532:07.09]I will see you all.
[532:08.71]I am exhausted.

[532:23.82]You are in big trouble.
[532:26.18]Are you admitting to the crime that you committed?
[532:29.53]You're in big trouble.
[532:33.12]Might actually have to put you in like... I'm done being dead serious.
[532:36.28]We're going to have to make an example here.
[532:47.05]No forgiveness.
[532:49.35]For an unforgivable sin.
[532:52.79]Put him on trial.
[532:58.88]Hey, I just wanted to let you know, sorry I put pornography in the chat.

[533:08.02]Sorry I did that.
[533:19.37]A trial will be determined.
[533:21.53]What happens to you?
[533:24.35]Don't expect me to go lightly here.
[533:30.14]At least he was honest.
