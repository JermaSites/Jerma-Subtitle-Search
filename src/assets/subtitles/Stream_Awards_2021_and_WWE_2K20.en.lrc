[00:02.83]Well, hello there.
[00:03.71]Happy New Year to some of you.
[00:06.33]At least those of you in EU.
[00:10.62]We're not celebrating yet.
[00:12.78]I'm not ready to celebrate yet.
[00:15.64]It's only 7.25 Pacific time.
[00:17.58]I got time.
[00:19.16]We're not on my time yet.
[00:22.24]But hello!
[00:24.88]We are early.
[00:27.29]We're gonna start soon for about five minutes.
[00:30.83]I don't want to just go live and then, here's my best new character.
[00:33.75]No, no, no, no.
[00:34.83]We're going to take our time.
[00:38.32]This is going to be a long one.
[00:41.68]I'm going to tell you right now.
[00:46.10]Let's just go over a few things while we turn the stream on.
[00:50.16]Are you drinking?
[00:54.99]I drink four times a year.
[00:56.99]Christmas, New Year's,
[00:59.75]And weddings.
[01:02.19]That's it.
[01:02.45]So I can live a little.
[01:06.67]You're early, what the fuck?
[01:08.09]We're pretty early, but... We're gonna just sit here for a few minutes.
[01:13.02]What I'm about to tell you is gonna... Just listen.
[01:16.74]There are 26 categories this year.
[01:19.66]Last year, I think there were 18.
[01:22.66]Now, some of these categories are fucking stupid, right?
[01:26.16]Let's be honest.
[01:28.42]Did Worst Peter really have to be on here this year?
[01:31.86]Yes.
[01:33.18]I don't care if I don't say it.
[01:34.26]It's going to be on here every single year.
[01:37.94]But there's a lot of categories to go through.
[01:40.94]And at the same time, there's a whole Jermania wrestling event to go through, too.
[01:47.25]There are eight matches, including the Rumble this year.
[01:49.67]And there are, I believe, I've had last count, 55 characters in this year's Rumble.
[01:57.01]Well, in this year's card.
[01:58.14]Because obviously you can't have more than 30 people in a Rumble.
[02:02.20]It's gonna get a little weird.
[02:03.82]It's gonna be mayhem.
[02:05.90]There are seven matches before the Rumble.
[02:07.68]We're gonna be here all night.
[02:10.72]That's why I started early, so that at 7.30, when people trickle in, we can just fucking get out of here.
[02:15.51]And get started.
[02:22.01]Button, hope you're having a good day.
[02:23.57]Hope you're having a good New Year's Eve.
[02:27.67]I got like all these characters.
[02:29.03]I got all these cards in front of me.
[02:31.35]I'm excited.
[02:32.21]I'm very excited about this.
[02:33.39]730.
[02:38.56]You're going to do facecam?
[02:44.08]Of course I will.
[02:47.66]I'll be full cam for a huge portion of this stream.
[02:52.40]You know what I mean?
[02:54.96]I'm all dressed up, too.
[02:55.98]I dressed up for this.
[02:58.70]I don't just have a suit jacket on.
[03:00.48]And a little fedora.
[03:03.04]No, no, no.
[03:03.78]I dressed up today.
[03:07.21]I'll show you.
[03:08.19]I'll stand up and I'll show you the whole outfit.
[03:13.69]You better be in an Among Us costume.
[03:17.97]You look like shit.
[03:18.73]I ain't even on camera yet, so you can't even say that.
[03:23.75]We're getting a ton of community subs.
[03:24.93]You don't have to be doing this.
[03:26.63]25 community subs from ChebIsDead.
[03:29.99]Thanks for the 25 subs.
[03:32.35]And we have so many.
[03:33.17]We have 5 from... Juice?
[03:35.23]5 from Skippy?
[03:37.12]5 from Pink?
[03:39.00]5 from Jenny?
[03:40.72]5 from 8Bit?
[03:42.16]10 from Onimos?
[03:44.82]Alright, sorry.
[03:45.54]I'm not gonna read these anymore.
[03:47.81]No more.
[03:48.25]I'm not reading any more community subs.
[03:49.61]I'll just make that really clear.
[03:51.15]After Summit 4, 4slash just gave 50.
[03:54.21]No more.
[03:54.97]I'm not reading any more community subs.
[03:56.39]You guys are spoiling me.
[03:58.10]We're not even in the new year yet.
[04:02.62]Thank you so much, everybody, for the insane amount of community subs.
[04:06.54]But I'm no longer going to read them.
[04:08.20]I'm making that clear.
[04:10.45]Clear as day.
[04:13.87]He hates his community.
[04:15.09]No, I love this community.
[04:17.41]I don't want to see this community go broke.
[04:23.82]Are you up in fart already?
[04:26.62]I was thinking about just trying as hard as I could right there.
[04:32.11]Are we going to watch the Croods?
[04:34.71]No, I didn't have a plan on watching the Croods today on stream.
[04:38.71]Why would I watch the Croods?
[04:44.28]Thanks a lot, everybody.
[04:45.30]It's unnecessary.
[04:46.40]You guys are too good to me.
[04:50.83]Why not?
[04:51.89]I'm not going to watch The Croods.
[04:53.39]I don't even want to watch that movie in my off time.
[04:55.69]Let alone on the stream.
[04:56.77]That's not to say the movie's bad.
[04:59.67]I just don't want to watch The Croods.
[05:11.70]Somebody typed the exact same thing as me, is what somebody said.
[05:15.53]What did you type?
[05:16.23]I'm actually kind of curious.
[05:19.57]Dude, somebody typed... Are you sure it's not just you on a second account?
[05:23.93]What about The Croods 2?
[05:24.61]No, I'm not gonna watch either one of those movies.
[05:33.61]Alright, you ready?
[05:36.47]It's 7.30, I think it's time to begin the festivities.
[05:39.57]What do you think?
[05:41.13]I did my hair?
[05:42.35]Or at least I tried to?
[05:44.77]Are we ready to begin the festivities?
[05:48.15]No, hold on.
[05:48.63]Get a drink.
[05:49.29]Go get a drink!
[05:49.95]Go, go, go, go!
[05:50.61]Hurry up!
[05:54.81]I'm giving you one minute.
[06:01.46]One minute.
[06:05.10]You're down to about 40 seconds, man.
[06:08.63]You gotta pee?
[06:09.23]Go, go, go!
[06:10.57]Stop!
[06:10.87]Oh, stop doing this!
[06:12.45]That's too much.
[06:13.33]That's too many community subs.
[06:14.97]That's way too many.
[06:17.30]That's enough.
[06:18.08]No more.
[06:18.46]No more community subs ever again.
[06:20.40]After that one.
[06:22.02]That's a hundred.
[06:23.00]From Repetio.
[06:26.34]That's enough.
[06:27.30]That's enough.
[06:28.68]Alright, I'm putting my fork down and I'm putting my knife down at the table.
[06:33.45]Alright, that's enough.
[06:39.87]You guys ready?
[06:41.17]Back from the bathroom?
[06:41.79]That's a shitload of money.
[06:42.75]Thank you.
[06:45.49]Don't stop doing this.
[06:48.21]Stop doing this.
[06:48.99]Stop doing it.
[06:49.63]I demand it.
[06:50.23]Okay, here we go.
[06:51.11]I know how to stop this.
[06:53.55]I gotta get on camera.
[06:55.06]So people can talk about how well I did my hair today.
[06:57.02]So let's go ahead and do it.
[06:59.82]Here we go.
[07:04.10]Hey!
[07:04.62]Look at me!
[07:05.12]Alright.
[07:07.76]I hope I dressed up.
[07:10.93]Don't judge me.
[07:11.53]Let me fly up.
[07:13.07]Okay, it is.
[07:14.23]I have like suit pants on, guys.
[07:16.55]I'm not messing around.
[07:20.80]I got my bands.
[07:22.26]I'm ready.
[07:23.14]I'm ready for the new year.
[07:23.94]You look like you're going for a job interview.
[07:28.08]I don't think you would wear these at a job interview.
[07:30.76]That'd be a little weird, I think.
[07:34.51]I don't know if these would be on.
[07:40.58]Yeah, it's New Year's.
[07:42.71]Don't you do blue stuff on New Year's?
[07:45.29]Or kind of?
[07:46.35]And guess what I got?
[07:51.53]Guess what's up there?
[07:56.75]I'll give you a hint.
[08:01.19]It's a ring light!
[08:11.37]That's so much.
[08:13.92]Alright, let me explain.
[08:14.76]The reason... First of all, this says finally 21 on it.
[08:18.78]I don't know if you can see that.
[08:21.20]It's 2022.
[08:21.48]I think that was on clearance somewhere.
[08:26.30]I'm over 21.
[08:29.24]But the cup is big enough to fit a whole bottle of champagne.
[08:36.77]I don't want to be moving around.
[08:37.97]I don't want to go like up and down and threw it into the refrigerator.
[08:41.01]No, I'm just, it's right here.
[08:42.35]I don't need to refill it.
[08:43.37]Why would I need to refill it?
[08:44.83]I'm not going to chug it.
[08:45.61]You're going to make me puke.
[08:48.95]I needed a glass that could fit the entire bottle of champagne just in case I needed it.
[08:52.72]And it's right here in case I need it.
[08:54.84]You like the decorations?
[08:57.34]Look, can you see?
[08:58.18]You see the glow sticks on the ground?
[09:03.68]Spill joke?
[09:04.32]No, I cannot fuck around.
[09:07.35]This is prop comedy.
[09:08.51]I'm telling you right now, this is not prop comedy.
[09:13.98]I actually wanted this to hold this much.
[09:16.46]And I know you're only supposed to do like that much, but I don't give a shit.
[09:19.42]I'm not a prop comedian.
[09:21.52]If this spills... I'm going to have to hire a professional cleaner to clean this whole room.
[09:30.07]A professional cleaning company is going to have to come in because this is a whole bottle of champagne.
[09:37.99]Alright.
[09:39.21]I am excited.
[09:39.85]Are you guys excited to find out some of the things that we've voted on for the last five or six days?
[09:47.24]I am up right now.
[09:48.62]I'm very excited.
[09:50.46]Where's Otto?
[09:51.58]Otto is in the other room, and he's lying down, and he's very happy.
[09:54.88]I didn't want to move him.
[09:56.68]He's in his Sunday best.
[09:57.58]You want me to stand up?
[09:58.18]Should I give you the whole thing?
[09:59.94]I'll give you the whole thing.
[10:08.54]I'll give you the whole thing.
[10:15.29]Yo, hey, you, yeah, I know you.
[10:26.07]Alright, that's enough.
[10:30.67]He looks like a youth pastor.
[10:38.94]Let me tell you about the dangers of alcohol, boys and girls.
[10:43.52]This is just grape juice.
[10:44.48]This is grape juice.
[10:50.13]I've had this shirt since I was like fucking 19 and it still fits.
[10:53.87]That should be a good thing to all of you.
[10:56.13]I should be able to flex that.
[10:57.41]I've had this shirt since I was like 20.
[10:58.85]Wow, do I still have that body.
[11:01.98]You know what I'm saying?
[11:02.66]Even though this is a little big and I get like a pregnant stomach.
[11:05.76]If I suck that in, well...
[11:09.09]Whoa.
[11:11.33]I'm not gonna spill it.
[11:12.29]Alright.
[11:13.47]First, alright, listen to me.
[11:15.18]We got a lot to do.
[11:16.32]I can't stall anymore.
[11:17.82]If you're here, you're here.
[11:18.70]If you're not, you're not.
[11:19.84]Welcome to the stream, everybody.
[11:21.94]A legendary spill joke in the making.
[11:25.34]Don't even fuck around like an idiot.
[11:27.78]We have, we're gonna start now.
[11:29.00]We're gonna start, we're gonna do like three or four categories.
[11:31.98]Then we're gonna move on to do a couple of matches.
[11:35.48]And then we're gonna kind of go bounce back and forth.
[11:37.22]So the first category we're gonna do, this is a good one.
[11:41.39]There's so many categories we gotta go now.
[11:43.61]Otherwise I'll be here till four in the morning, Pacific time.
[11:46.45]What time is it?
[11:48.67]Bingo!
[11:50.19]Our first category is Best New Character.
[11:56.60]We've seen a lot of new characters this year, considering some of the larger streams that you've seen on this channel.
[12:02.80]And we can just go ahead and get started.
[12:04.00]Ladies and gentlemen, here are the nominees for Best New Character.
[12:18.08]And I'm joined by Josh from ScienceCenterNevada.org.
[12:22.42]Josh, good to see you.
[12:23.42]So, I guess as an archaeologist, you could probably give us... Wait, wait, wait.
[12:30.31]This isn't archaeology.
[12:31.85]It's not?
[12:32.45]No, we're dealing with rocks.
[12:34.81]Oh, okay.
[12:35.37]Archaeology is people stuff.
[12:37.05]Rock stuff, that's geology.
[12:39.47]So this is not archaeology?
[12:41.99]Not at all.
[12:42.93]Come on out.
[12:45.07]Catboy Jerma.
[12:55.28]Where am I?
[13:01.70]I need to wink into this mirror.
[13:04.05]Why?
[13:06.95]Ow!
[13:07.07]My head!
[13:07.47]My brain just hurt!
[13:12.01]Hi.
[13:13.55]Hi.
[13:14.13]I'm assuming that you must be the maid?
[13:16.30]I heard you ordered a sexy maid service.
[13:18.78]Why don't you grab a piece of bread?
[13:20.20]I want you to eat.
[13:22.47]Well, I've been cleaning.
[13:23.35]I wouldn't dare touch it with my hands.
[13:25.53]Right.
[13:25.83]But if you just... But just eat.
[13:27.45]Wash your hands and then eat.
[13:31.21]I'm not putting it in your mouth.
[13:32.51]Right.
[13:32.71]No, of course.
[13:34.84]The name's Amelia.
[13:35.98]It's Amelia.
[13:36.64]Amelia.
[13:37.32]Okay, Amelia.
[13:38.22]Thank you.
[13:38.72]I appreciate it.
[13:39.40]But I need to come out of the shower now.
[13:41.54]That's a good one already.
[13:43.26]That's a good one.
[13:43.76]It's like a little guy.
[13:47.54]Oh, I'm sorry.
[13:48.66]Ow, my face.
[13:50.18]I'm really sorry.
[13:50.72]I didn't mean to.
[13:52.20]Don't do that again.
[13:53.76]Okay, I won't.
[13:55.12]Oh, no.
[14:00.98]Oh, my God.
[14:03.72]Oh, my fucking God.
[14:05.80]Huh?
[14:08.00]You want to do what?
[14:11.24]I don't know.
[14:12.20]I'm not going out there.
[14:13.32]What the fuck am I... Hey, bear, you're in danger.
[14:19.90]OH!
[14:21.08]OH!
[14:21.98]OH MY GOD, HE'S BITING ME!
[14:24.08]OH, MY BODY!
[14:25.02]OH, Jesus!
[14:26.66]OH, PLAY DEAD, PLAY DEAD, PLAY DEAD!
[14:29.14]PLAY DEAD, PLAY DEAD!
[14:29.84]How about Strong Henry?
[14:32.87]Strong Henry Flush.
[14:34.33]Just fucking break his neck.
[14:36.33]Break his fucking neck.
[14:37.31]What is this guy on here?
[14:39.25]Just kill him.
[14:40.67]You got voted off.
[14:41.41]You're out.
[14:43.77]Goodbye.
[14:44.29]He's done.
[14:48.75]Um...
[14:50.87]What, uh, what are you doing?
[14:53.97]What are you doing?
[14:54.89]What are you doing?
[14:56.99]What the fuck are you doing?
[14:58.79]This is my, no, no, no, no, no, excuse me.
[15:01.14]This is my house.
[15:02.20]I'm like, why am I hiding outside of my own house?
[15:05.06]I'm hiding, alright.
[15:07.28]I need to eat out of that peanut butter later.
[15:08.90]Now I'm not going to.
[15:09.82]I'm not eating out of that peanut butter.
[15:16.09]Alright, this is fucked up because I feel like this person, if they're bogus, just go right into their mouth.
[15:20.47]That's fucked up.
[15:22.09]If this person's asleep on the train and they have a runny nose, they're just pulling the runny nose directly into their mouth.
[15:27.09]No, this doesn't look like it.
[15:28.63]Oh my God.
[15:29.29]Somebody said this looks like Adam Driver.
[15:32.88]What are you talking about?
[15:34.80]How do you see Adam Driver?
[15:36.30]Adam Driver is like a handsome, like dashing man.
[15:39.04]What are you talking about?
[15:39.98]Dude, that is...
[15:42.58]I'll zoom in on you.
[15:43.46]I know who had my vote.
[15:45.16]I know who had my vote.
[15:45.82]A little praying mantis baby decided to sit up here and stay here.
[15:50.34]Take a look.
[15:53.37]Look at how big our boy has gotten.
[15:58.17]He's stuck around for the whole four months.
[16:02.42]And then, one day he just wasn't there.
[16:33.67]Oops, we're live.
[16:34.31]Sorry about that.
[16:36.93]There were a lot of new characters.
[16:38.77]A lot.
[16:40.43]Every category had so many nominees.
[16:43.48]We had to drop... I'll just tell you, I think there were 200 best and worst noise nominees.
[16:50.70]How do you even narrow those down?
[16:53.79]It took a week straight of narrowing that down.
[16:58.77]And this still gives 25 nominees.
[17:01.96]Anyways, the winner, ladies and gentlemen, of Best New Character... Let me do that again.
[17:18.03]With 35% of the vote, ladies and gentlemen, the winner...
[17:26.09]Catboy Jerma.
[17:28.75]Amelia came in at second at 18% and the Shadow Movers at 13%.
[17:32.55]This also was the least skipped question.
[17:36.45]Almost everybody answered this.
[17:39.98]Catboy Jerma, here you go.
[17:40.98]I'll give it to you.
[17:41.58]Take a look.
[17:43.90]Best new character, Catboy Jerma.
[17:45.14]It was a landslide.
[17:46.12]It was just an absolute landslide.
[17:51.00]Oh, well.
[17:53.01]I like to see when they're close, you know?
[17:54.49]Oh.
[17:56.48]I love Catboy Jerma.
[17:59.10]I voted for Cromwell.
[18:00.26]Alright, we're going to do this one right now because this one's stupid.
[18:07.79]Cromwell was robbed?
[18:09.13]I don't know.
[18:12.41]Let's fucking go!
[18:13.53]I don't even want to do this category.
[18:30.03]We're going to go.
[18:30.85]Let's just do it now.
[18:31.87]The next category is best.
[18:37.29]And if you don't know what that is, that is the first boss in The Simpsons arcade game.
[18:42.92]It's a noise that he makes.
[18:44.72]And I just can't stop doing it.
[18:47.85]I just can't stop making the sound.
[18:50.37]So instead of having this show up like 10 times in best and worst noise, it was just removed and gave its own damn category.
[18:59.25]I've apparently done this so many times that it had to have its own category.
[19:02.97]Let's just go.
[19:04.23]The nominees for best... You know, just here it is.
[19:19.60]Invincible mode.
[19:23.92]Here comes a rage stream.
[19:33.25]Watch out.
[19:55.61]Can you please spell the sound?
[19:58.15]It's just... Spell it.
[20:10.75]The category is best... This is not... I didn't put that for a category.
[20:22.30]Okay.
[20:23.89]So, ladies and gentlemen, the winner.
[20:26.39]That, like, embarrassed me.
[20:27.71]I, like, turned red.
[20:28.27]Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of best for this year.
[20:34.86]He probably won't be back, but we'll do it for 2021.
[20:36.72]Wait.
[20:36.88]That's cute.
[20:47.21]The winner.
[20:50.39]Is... This is like a three-way tie.
[20:57.38]I don't even remember which ones these were.
[20:59.04]A three-way tie, pretty much, between Rage Stream, which was the Resident Evil 6 one, Spelling Explanation, which is the one where I was explaining it during Monster Rancher, and then the real voice one, where it was just me saying it.
[21:18.67]Look at that.
[21:19.93]It was a 50 vote difference.
[21:22.81]25, 25.
[21:22.97]It's because it's all the same sound.
[21:26.09]It's literally.
[21:26.63]Hold on.
[21:33.54]I want.
[21:33.78]Where's real voice?
[21:34.72]I probably should have had a clip before who won.
[21:40.40]Who cares?
[21:41.16]Okay.
[21:41.30]Alright.
[21:42.48]We'll do one more.
[21:43.06]Then we're going to get to.
[21:43.62]No, we'll do two more.
[21:44.34]Two more.
[21:45.02]We got a long way to go.
[21:47.26]How much was that skipped?
[21:48.21]No.
[21:49.20]Alright, coming up next!
[21:51.28]We have Rumble stuff, we have wrestling stuff to do too, so there's 26 fucking categories.
[21:57.08]Best accident is coming up here.
[21:59.82]That includes spilling something.
[22:02.84]That includes doing something I probably shouldn't have done on camera.
[22:07.05]There's been a lot of those over the years.
[22:09.01]There were quite a few in 2021.
[22:11.63]So this is for what you have decided was the best accident that has happened on this stream.
[22:18.63]And surprisingly...
[22:21.96]One of them didn't make it.
[22:23.52]We'll find out which one.
[22:26.75]Best accident nominees are... These bag of juggles.
[22:40.49]How do you guys think about that one?
[22:43.21]You think that was a good play?
[22:44.99]I know what you guys want.
[22:46.19]I know what you're looking for.
[22:52.30]I drank two Gatorades before the stream.
[22:57.11]God.
[23:01.18]This context for this is the people that don't know what that is.
[23:03.20]This context, I promise.
[23:04.86]Does anybody else feel a slight breeze?
[23:26.29]They saw me having sex with death in my bed, and I just want to say that that's not me.
[23:33.37]That's not me.
[23:33.81]That's not who I am.
[23:35.20]I don't have sex with, like, three different people and, like, lie to everybody.
[23:38.36]That's from a week ago.
[23:39.14]It was three days ago.
[23:39.96]But that's not me.
[23:41.22]That's not who I am.
[23:43.80]I woohooed him.
[23:45.18]But you can't say that word.
[23:46.44]That's foam!
[23:48.26]Time for a foam party!
[24:03.04]Oh no, not again.
[24:04.80]This sucked.
[24:11.91]You know what it looks like?
[24:13.25]Have you seen those, um...
[24:28.04]Okay, you know those optical illusions where it's like the huge guy is standing here and there's like a tiny little person in the corner and it's just like, oh wow, oh my god, this is, and they're in a room and the furniture looks all weird.
[24:40.92]Like it's because the room is like 50 feet long and it's like slanted.
[24:45.46]That's what's going on here, because look at, I'm a normal person, but when I go back here, I don't know why.
[24:55.47]I don't understand, it looks so bizarre, whatever.
[24:58.04]People are very, very ignorant of Dead Ringer spies.
[25:01.48]They never check and they always lose their ground.
[25:05.10]So I get that sniper.
[25:06.10]I get this scout.
[25:07.54]Pull the Dead Ringer out.
[25:08.48]We turn around.
[25:09.52]We try and do it again.
[25:11.90]This engineer knows I'm around.
[25:13.40]He's starting to wise up a little bit to Dead Ringer spy.
[25:16.74]God damn it.
[25:17.72]Get the cat.
[25:18.48]Get the cat.
[25:18.96]Come on.
[25:19.32]Keep going.
[25:20.14]Move.
[25:20.98]You're almost there.
[25:21.62]You're almost out of the range.
[25:23.60]You're almost out.
[25:24.16]You're almost out.
[25:24.60]You're almost out.
[25:25.00]You're almost out.
[25:25.40]Good, good, good, good.
[25:26.17]Oh, thank God.
[25:27.61]Thank God, you made it.
[25:32.33]What does this guy look like?
[25:38.01]There, alright, there you go.
[25:39.65]You got what you wanted, everybody that was here.
[25:41.81]You got the imposterous fucking stupid ass sus face.
[25:46.30]That, you got it.
[25:47.46]I did, I just realized that's what I just did.
[25:50.16]There it is.
[25:51.12]You've been asking for that for like two hours, and I didn't, I just did it.
[25:53.98]God.
[26:07.02]See what I'm talking about?
[26:07.98]This guy just rolled that guy.
[26:09.26]That guy just rolled that guy up in a burrito and ate his ass.
[26:12.68]Ate him.
[26:13.66]I ate him up.
[26:14.84]I swallowed him up.
[26:16.22]I swallowed him up, Paul.
[26:18.28]And I killed him.
[26:20.71]There's so many of these.
[26:27.59]Holy shit!
[26:34.28]Alright, so... There's your accident nominees for best accident.
[26:42.86]Look at these.
[26:43.36]Look at how cute these are.
[26:45.79]The winner for best accident 2021 is... I keep making it... I keep muting the fucking goddamn thing.
[26:54.71]Have I ever streamed before ever in my life?
[26:56.51]It's been like 12 years.
[26:57.45]The winner...
[27:05.00]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27:08.78]The juggles zerk with 25% of the vote.
[27:11.86]It was just... Alright, listen.
[27:14.77]Let me tell you who the... Let me give some context.
[27:19.27]I made up this guy named Juggles who streams, he's like a streamer.
[27:22.00]And what he does is he drinks like a bunch of Gatorades and just like goes on IRL Just Chatting like we are now.
[27:30.00]And he fucking shakes his stomach and all like the liquid sounds pick up on his microphone and people like donate money to him and shit. Uhm.
[27:38.00]And it looked really, really weird when I did that on camera without the bottom part.
[27:40.00]There's your context, for all the new viewers. There's a lot of people here.
[27:44.00]Uh, in second place sex with death at 16% and then the cat meteor.
[27:49.35]Cat Meteor at 14%.
[27:51.35]There are your top three.
[27:55.53]There they are.
[27:57.07]That one ran away with it too.
[27:58.97]We're going to do one more and then we're going to move on to wrestling.
[28:00.93]I got a lot.
[28:02.23]This one's Best Pog Face.
[28:04.93]Instead of Worst Face, we added a category called Best Pog Face.
[28:10.26]Do I even need to run the video for this one?
[28:13.40]Honest to God, do I even need to?
[28:15.18]I don't think I have to run the video.
[28:16.89]I mean, I'm going to because, like, Dazza made a bunch of awesome videos for this.
[28:21.70]But, I mean, like, I think it was, like, 60% of the vote won this.
[28:24.50]You all know what it is.
[28:25.54]But just let's watch it.
[28:27.18]Best pog face of 2021 incoming, here it is!

[29:00.42]I just like fucked up my neck.
[29:03.50]That one was pretty good too, I will say.
[29:05.16]I just pogged too much and I just put a kink in my neck.
[29:10.33]Oh!

[30:24.46]Oh, you couldn't hear it.
[30:25.06]I took the audio off.
[30:26.70]Sorry.
[30:27.34]It was muted.
[30:27.76]I was doing the drum roll.
[30:29.06]Fuck!
[30:33.88]What the fuck, man?
[30:34.94]You made me look like an idiot.
[30:35.80]Okay.
[30:40.92]With 58% of the vote, that's the highest we've ever seen.
[30:48.74]was the onion ring.
[30:51.64]The onion ring.
[30:55.36]Slime Rancher 2 reaction was 9% and then Treasure Map was 8%.
[30:59.20]This is also one of the least skipped questions.
[31:05.85]58% of the vote.
[31:06.63]That's almost everybody.
[31:09.41]And there were like 20 plus thousand responses or something.
[31:12.69]At least 18,000 responses.
[31:14.07]So that's ridiculous.
[31:15.03]I can't believe that.
[31:17.05]That's actually crazy.

[33:03.79]I think we're good.
[33:04.57]Yes, we are good.
[33:05.67]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Jermania 2021.
[33:11.37]My name is Jerma985.
[33:12.57]How are you?
[33:13.11]Welcome to the show.
[33:15.90]We got quite a big one for you here.
[33:18.68]Eight matches, including the Rumble.
[33:21.73]Our first match.
[33:23.59]What the hell is that?
[33:26.23]Why was it so huge?
[33:28.49]And why is the Statue of Liberty here?
[33:30.71]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[33:32.93]I just saved the whole stream.
[33:35.92]I just saved the entire fucking stream.
[33:39.68]It just leaked everything.
[33:41.58]Everything is on the screen right now.
[33:43.54]Every match, every participant, I just saved the whole stream.
[33:46.68]Thank God.
[33:47.46]Here we go.
[33:54.94]I can't show the screen because there's a leak.
[33:57.80]Holy shit, I'm so glad I did that.
[33:59.16]That would have been a disaster.
[34:04.10]Huge thanks.
[34:05.09]I gotta... Well, this is loading.
[34:07.27]Tag team match 2v2.
[34:08.35]I would call this one a scary match.
[34:14.31]I would call this one a horrifying match.
[34:17.87]Horrifying.
[34:20.36]Opster...
[34:22.89]Here we go.
[34:23.41]Let's shout everybody out.
[34:24.55]Opster, Leather Jacket, Kroski, VRJosh.
[34:28.99]Huge shout out to you guys.
[34:31.95]This doesn't happen without them because they made literally fucking everybody.
[34:36.09]Like, I didn't think I was going to be able to get to do a Rumble this year because I've been so busy with all this other shit.
[34:40.87]Everybody seriously, like... Okay, here we go.
[34:42.85]Here we go.
[34:43.81]Huge thanks to those guys.
[34:44.95]This is literally... This does not happen unless they do it.
[34:47.17]So, huge thanks.
[34:49.13]Are you ready?
[34:52.33]Let's go!
[34:52.67]Coming up first, we have Chris Redfield.
[35:07.78]In his, uh, I think that's a, uh, fish.
[35:11.00]Jesus.
[35:13.37]In his official, uh, Stars uniform.
[35:15.55]Chris Redfield.
[35:25.00]Chris R. Chris R. Chris Redfield.
[35:33.19]Those of you that know, one of the most classic meme videos I think I've ever seen.
[35:43.31]Now, who is Chris Redfield's partner?
[35:44.59]You're probably asking.
[35:45.17]You're probably wondering.
[35:46.61]Well, that's easy.
[35:50.10]Was a big fan of Resident Evil 8.
[35:52.24]Thought it was potentially a game of the year.
[35:53.68]Got the Grotto Beasts chairs, which is really cool.
[35:58.78]His partner!
[36:00.91]Lady Dimitrescu!
[36:03.65]Lady Dimitrescu!
[36:14.52]Lady Destroyer.
[36:15.56]I think I spelled the name wrong too, by the way.
[36:19.86]I can't even see the chat now.
[36:21.23]Shit, my computer crashed.
[36:23.33]Am I still live?
[36:24.25]I hope so.
[36:24.79]I'm gonna have to open up on my phone.
[36:25.75]I can see chat on the phone.
[36:32.05]Yeah, I can see chat on the phone.
[36:33.71]Oh, hell yeah.
[36:36.81]Perfect.
[36:40.07]Yep, I can see chat right here.
[36:41.55]Perfect.
[36:46.17]I think Lady Dimitrescu is as big as you can possibly make a wrestler.
[36:51.34]I think she's like eight feet tall.
[36:52.92]I have no idea.
[36:54.38]It's going to be insane.
[36:56.70]So who are they fighting against?
[36:57.54]You're probably wondering.
[36:58.18]Well, a couple of fan favorites, I think.
[37:01.70]One in particular is a very large fan favorite.
[37:04.69]You're not even live?
[37:05.37]I'm live.
[37:07.85]Jigsaw!
[37:10.33]I love how that takes up the whole screen.
[37:16.60]Jigsaw's 200 pounds.
[37:20.16]Jigsaw and someone else.
[37:21.72]And can you guess who that someone else is?
[37:32.39]Who would be the perfect, terrifying, horrifying partner to Jigsaw?
[37:37.55]I'm going to tell you, you're going to have to be careful here.
[37:43.28]I mean, a lot of us are going to think this is really funny, but...
[37:46.55]Money is gonna die.
[37:48.65]And there's nothing I can do about that, unfortunately.
[37:54.02]Jigsaw's partner in the tag team match is none other.
[38:00.36]Then.
[38:04.54]Then.
[38:07.40]Then.
[38:11.57]WWE 2K likes to do this thing where it loads the next thing.
[38:15.73]The horror.
[38:17.57]Don't look at it.
[38:18.45]Don't look at it.
[38:20.23]Don't look at it.
[38:26.95]It's hilarious.
[38:27.87]I know, but turn off your screen for a few minutes.
[38:32.32]We've got Lady Demetra Sue and Banana Chris Redfield versus Jigsaw and the horror in the first match.
[38:38.54]Just to get us started here.
[38:47.03]I don't think there's any extreme rules or anything.
[38:48.84]This is just to get us going.
[38:51.38]Because there's too many characters.
[38:54.04]I am going to say we could probably get predictions going too if we want on some of these matches.
[38:56.82]I would start it now if you could.
[38:58.84]Horror.
[39:05.40]I am peeping hard.
[39:09.89]And here we go.
[39:10.47]Ladies and gentlemen, the first match of 2021.
[39:11.63]Let's go.
[39:19.29]I feel the power.
[39:20.63]Chris Redfield.
[39:22.26]Jigsaw.
[39:23.26]Tag team match.
[39:25.52]And begin.
[39:27.12]Welcome.
[39:29.88]So if you want to know everybody's stats, everybody is pretty much in the same stat category.
[39:35.83]Some people are stronger than others, obviously, because they are stronger than others.
[39:39.76]Big Saw starting to get off with it.
[39:42.04]Chris Redfield is barely even doing it.
[39:44.00]Going to tag out already.
[39:45.26]Peep of the Horror at the very first 5 to 10 seconds.
[39:48.09]Not confident.
[39:49.73]Oh, the Horror with a horrific kick to the stomach.
[39:53.63]As he pummels into Chris Redfield's midsection.
[39:56.43]Going down to an E. Now, the tag rules apply here.
[40:01.26]You cannot come into the ring unless you're tagged in.
[40:04.16]Otherwise, you're disqualified.
[40:04.98]Disqualified.
[40:09.78]I need to start making referees.
[40:11.52]Big bear hug here by the horror on Chris Redfield.
[40:14.70]Did he just tap out?
[40:17.08]I hope not.
[40:22.65]With a thunderclap to the ears.
[40:24.19]Oh, my God.
[40:25.03]The horror does not care at all.
[40:26.35]Going to go for the next snap.
[40:27.15]No, he's going to go for the right ear scrunch.
[40:32.63]Maybe a powerbomb.
[40:33.45]No, spinning neckbreaker from the horror.
[40:36.00]Lady Dimitrisou goes for the tag.
[40:37.52]Here we go.
[40:38.04]Now, this is an even match.
[40:39.00]We've got Lady Dimitrisou.
[40:40.28]Oh, no.
[40:40.95]Caught it.
[40:44.07]Both enormous wrestlers.
[40:47.89]Lady Dimitrisou, I think, is the highest you can possibly make a wrestler.
[40:50.39]Ahara might be as well.
[40:53.46]Jigsaw going to come in and wants to play a little game here.
[40:59.10]How do you even do a move to somebody this much bigger?
[41:03.58]I guess like that.
[41:07.28]Chris Redfield's out on the outside.
[41:09.22]There are rules in this fight.
[41:14.86]I love where the banana is on Chris Redfield.
[41:16.42]It's perfect.
[41:19.75]Jigsaw is really timid.
[41:23.43]Honestly, I would do the same thing.
[41:25.61]Why would you ever fight when you have this demonic, otherworldly, godlike character that can just go in?
[41:32.40]The two humans are letting the two demon people fight, which is, I think, a great strategy.
[41:40.15]Going over to the ropes.
[41:41.01]Gonna go to the top rope.
[41:43.09]Did she get it?
[41:43.65]She got it.
[41:44.23]Chris Redfield in the ring now.
[41:45.27]Hara up on the turnbuckle.
[41:47.25]And... What an idiot.
[41:50.17]Why would you do that?
[41:57.32]Knee to the face.
[41:59.86]He's throwing.
[42:00.54]I know.
[42:00.76]What the hell?
[42:03.20]Big right hand by Chris Redfield.
[42:07.57]Caught it!
[42:08.39]We got momentum here from Banana Chris Redfield.
[42:13.36]Setting him up to a seated position.
[42:14.78]Gonna go for the... Gonna go for the... I don't even know what this is.
[42:19.08]I don't even want to say what I think it is.
[42:21.16]I don't know.
[42:21.44]He was like squishing his head.
[42:25.14]He's gonna do it again?
[42:25.84]No, he's going for that CQC that he learned at the Stars training facility.
[42:33.61]No, no.
[42:34.25]He's bumping into... Gonna tag in Lady Demetrius, too.
[42:41.64]Horror is in a bad place right now.
[42:45.34]Lady Dimitrescu's got him in a crab.
[42:48.18]Will we see a tap out from the horror?
[42:49.96]I hope not.
[42:52.00]Oh, it's going to be close.
[42:56.10]Oh, big reversal by the horror.
[43:01.70]Momentum shift incoming possibly here.
[43:09.63]Oh, he's grabbing her by the face!
[43:11.84]He's hit!
[43:12.58]She's peeping!
[43:13.68]She's peeping the horror right now!
[43:14.84]That's all she can see!
[43:15.96]That's it!
[43:17.88]No, wait a minute!
[43:20.08]Oh!
[43:20.42]Big reversal!
[43:24.17]She's got him!
[43:26.95]Almost threw him over the top ropes!
[43:28.25]What a huge comeback!
[43:29.33]What an absolutely insane reversal!
[43:32.15]No way!
[43:33.95]Huge!
[43:34.71]Absolutely massive!
[43:36.45]You don't peep the horror and live!
[43:42.78]Although, a little bit of a reversal here.
[43:44.54]Chris Redfield may be going to go for some kind of tomfoolery on the top ropes here.
[43:48.26]No, Jigsaw's coming in.
[43:52.34]He just tagged him into pin.
[43:54.90]One.
[43:56.46]What are you doing, Jigsaw?
[43:57.74]What are you thinking?
[43:58.46]Oh, we're going to see a breather here.
[44:02.92]No.
[44:05.81]No.
[44:18.01]Punching her in the stomach, but it did not faze her at all.
[44:20.59]She is a demon.
[44:25.10]Jigsaw's just a guy in a suit.
[44:27.28]And it's not even a guy, it's a little toy thing.
[44:31.82]This match is going longer than I thought it was, too.
[44:33.48]This is actually pretty exciting.
[44:36.51]Big toss across the ring.
[44:42.32]I wonder if we're gonna go see a finishing move here.
[44:44.88]No, let's see.
[44:46.68]He's telling him to leave it alone, Ethan.
[44:52.59]Yup.
[44:53.69]I think he's getting ready to use.
[44:54.61]You better leave it alone, Ethan.
[44:57.81]I think he's right here.
[44:58.41]He's gonna go for it.
[45:00.69]Why does he keep doing the same move?
[45:03.02]He just keeps kicking him in the chest.
[45:09.37]The horror is reaching so desperately and it cannot reach.
[45:13.51]Even though he's huge.
[45:16.09]Oh, no.
[45:18.09]Jerma suplex number one.
[45:19.31]Jerma suplex number two.
[45:22.31]Jerma suplex number three.
[45:23.92]You're not getting up from that one.
[45:31.14]Just destroyed.
[45:32.04]Oh, reversal.
[45:34.12]Reversal.
[45:36.21]Got to get him out of there, yeah.
[45:38.21]Jigsaw's got to get out or it's over.
[45:45.90]No, he broke it away.
[45:47.04]I love how Chris Redfield just kicks people.
[45:52.62]He just puts them on the ground and kicks them in the back of the head.
[45:56.12]No, no, trying to go for that submission move.
[46:01.09]Jigsaw is throwing right now.
[46:02.21]Jigsaw is pretty weak.
[46:04.39]This is really balanced right now because Peep the Horror is really, really powerful.
[46:07.26]Going for the armbar.
[46:07.98]Is he going to get it?
[46:10.60]No!
[46:11.68]Hold on for dear life, Jigsaw.
[46:13.32]Can you do it?
[46:13.98]Can you stay?
[46:15.08]Or is it over?
[46:18.74]No help from Horror.
[46:20.60]Peep the Horror doesn't even care.
[46:24.10]All the while, Dimitrisou is getting health increases as well, recovering lots of damage.
[46:28.56]Going for another one.
[46:29.54]Going for that.
[46:30.14]Going for another armbar.
[46:31.02]That's all.
[46:32.58]The horror.
[46:33.77]Broke it up.
[46:34.59]Beautiful play by the Haru.
[46:35.65]You can't let that happen.
[46:37.45]He's a trained military professional.
[46:39.19]You can't let him do those moves.
[46:41.13]It's over if you do.
[46:44.14]What is going on?
[46:49.60]That could be it.
[46:50.14]There's one.
[46:51.92]There's two.
[46:54.36]Oh!
[46:55.55]That was close.
[46:57.65]Was that it?
[46:59.28]No, he didn't get it.
[47:01.29]He didn't do three.
[47:02.21]What's going on?
[47:03.91]He only did two.
[47:04.83]He did two and a half.
[47:05.51]There's Redfield on the top rope.
[47:08.61]Okay.
[47:10.03]Okay, just pin him.
[47:11.31]Pin him and let's get it on with.
[47:13.55]Give me a fucking break.
[47:14.49]Yes.
[47:17.45]You know, there's a match to win.
[47:18.63]There's a match to win.
[47:21.05]And he's on the ground right now for you to pin.
[47:23.71]But apparently you don't care about that.
[47:26.90]Chris Redfield just going for some taunting, and that's going to be the downfall.
[47:29.60]Could have had the victory right there.
[47:30.78]Jigsaw now doing the same terrible move he did earlier, which is a series of really weak punches to the chest, which don't even hurt.
[47:41.85]It's the equivalent of when a little kid throws like a magic wand at you, and you pretend like it hurt to make them laugh.
[47:52.15]Exact same scenario.
[47:59.64]What is going on here?
[48:00.56]Why are they going outside?
[48:02.60]There's no countouts.
[48:05.68]Oh, there is countouts.
[48:12.71]What are you doing outside?
[48:14.01]He's just grabbing his head.
[48:17.21]Submissions do not happen outside, even if it works.
[48:22.76]He could hurt him.
[48:30.90]I think a count-out is 10, I believe.
[48:32.52]This is bad.
[48:34.28]Get back in the ring, Har.
[48:35.56]What are you doing?
[48:36.22]Oh, this is gonna be it!
[48:41.38]That's it.
[48:42.06]That's it.
[48:42.50]He's gonna get counted out.
[48:45.54]The referee's slowing the count down, apparently.
[48:48.14]That was the longest 8 I think I've ever seen in the entire time I've played these games.
[48:54.85]Why are you out here counting yourself out?
[48:56.51]Is this double elimination?
[49:00.66]Who?
[49:01.00]Wait, what?
[49:01.94]What the fuck?
[49:02.47]What are you talking about?
[49:11.05]What?
[49:14.68]That was bullshit.
[49:16.48]That was so messed up.
[49:19.00]Why did he start the count over?
[49:22.62]The horror is not in good shape.
[49:24.15]He thinks he's out of energy.
[49:27.55]Jigsaw does not even want to put a hand out.
[49:29.83]This is a bad team situation here.
[49:33.44]He won't even put a hand out.
[49:35.64]Bad blood forming here between Horror and Jigsaw while Chris Redfield's got him in a powerbomb.
[49:41.28]That's bad.
[49:47.09]Quadruple powerbomb.
[49:49.09]Unless Jigsaw does something about this, this is the end here.
[49:53.11]That's it.
[49:55.35]One.
[49:56.46]Two.
[49:57.64]Finally, Jigsaw decides to do something.
[50:02.19]Doesn't even care about anything else in the whole match.
[50:07.61]Oh, that's it.
[50:08.33]That's it.
[50:08.63]He's got him.
[50:09.39]He's got him.
[50:09.91]He's got him.
[50:10.23]There's no way to hurt.
[50:10.93]That's it.
[50:12.09]Game over.
[50:13.73]Chris Redfield, ladies and gentlemen, got him.
[50:17.42]In the arm bar.
[50:18.22]I told you he was militarily trained.
[50:21.64]You got to watch out for that one.
[50:23.83]I don't know what they were doing in the outside.
[50:25.22]It was stupid.
[50:26.42]Why would they not count?
[50:28.58]That was really strange.
[50:34.26]Wow, there are your winners.
[50:36.16]Chris Redfield and Lady Dimitrisou.
[50:39.27]Sorry, sorry, hold on.
[50:40.71]Demetre.
[50:41.89]Demetre.
[50:49.11]Weird that they did.
[50:49.97]Oh, they're getting booed.
[50:50.83]This is a huge boo.
[50:54.98]Alright, we're going to move on to the next match really quickly.
[50:59.92]We're going to do two because there are eight matches.
[51:02.01]So we got to get through these.
[51:03.43]We're going to move right on to the next one.
[51:05.33]But I don't want any spoilers.
[51:07.37]So we're going to go back to full cam here for just a second.
[51:11.13]That was kind of an upset.
[51:12.35]I think a lot of people expected the horror to win that.
[51:16.60]Let me go like this real quick.
[51:17.96]Hopefully this doesn't crash.
[51:19.28]I hope not.
[51:20.02]Please, God.
[51:20.84]I know I've seen a lot of boos.
[51:21.88]Yeah, a lot of you guys are not happy about that.
[51:24.45]Alright, next match.
[51:26.37]We're going to keep moving forward.
[51:30.55]This one's going to be wacky.
[51:38.57]I get to see it.
[51:39.15]You don't.
[51:41.59]Here comes the payout.
[51:42.19]Yeah.
[51:42.67]If you bet on that, then yeah.
[51:46.43]Why does he have a urinal in the corner of his room?
[51:53.83]It's a...
[51:56.93]It's like a fan, man.
[51:58.23]It gets hot in here.
[51:59.11]It's Las Vegas.
[52:00.49]It's a fan.
[52:03.93]Alright.
[52:05.39]The next one coming up is a four-way extreme rules match.
[52:10.81]Anything goes.
[52:11.55]Any weapon.
[52:12.81]Any way to beat your opponent.
[52:15.57]I'm looking forward to this one.
[52:16.43]This one's going to be fun.
[52:18.23]Here we go.
[52:18.57]Ladies and gentlemen, match two of Drew Mania 2021 is incoming just as fast as this year went, it seems.
[52:26.54]Here we go.
[52:35.89]Fatal 4-Way.
[52:39.19]This one is, uh... First contestant is Armin Aaron Armlet.
[52:46.56]It's so good.
[52:55.76]We have Armin from Attack on Titan.
[52:59.36]You might be able to guess what this Fatal 4-Way is.
[53:01.42]Maybe after the next contestant.
[53:05.32]But yeah, we have Armin, Eren, Arlet.
[53:10.99]As the first contestant.
[53:15.49]I love this character so much.
[53:20.35]Somebody got it already.
[53:21.91]I'm surprised that you could call it already.
[53:28.24]This is the Battle of the Sounds.
[53:32.56]We've already seen one of these categories this year.
[53:38.96]No spoilers.
[53:40.94]But it's the Battle of the Sounds.
[53:46.27]The next contestant coming up.
[53:49.85]The La La Dog.
[53:56.67]Lala.
[54:06.65]That is their name.
[54:08.05]That is actually technically their name.
[54:11.11]Don't try this at home.
[54:12.07]Please don't.
[54:12.53]You're going to get hurt.
[54:15.89]So we have Aaron.
[54:17.51]Lala.
[54:18.51]Who else could be in this fatal four-way?
[54:22.67]The sound effects from 2021.
[54:28.78]That's the worst character?
[54:31.80]Yeah, I mean, they're all pretty bad.
[54:33.42]They're all the worst character.
[54:37.72]I actually think they are.
[54:38.36]I think they turned out great.
[54:41.30]Everybody in the whole... Every Rumble is... Whoa.
[54:45.22]Every Rumble is worst character.
[54:46.78]What the hell was that?
[54:55.63]Who is the third contestant?
[54:56.79]Let's find out right now.
[55:00.47]In our battle of the sound effects.
[55:03.89]Lala is pissed at this entrant.
[55:05.43]Who is it?
[55:09.75]All the way from The Simpsons.
[55:15.93]The Simpsons arcade game.
[55:18.65]This is actually their name.
[55:19.97]It's Warner Van Braun or something.
[55:23.04]It's the Ool guy.
[55:24.62]It's the first boss of The Simpsons arcade game.
[55:32.02]Still one more person to go.
[55:32.94]No, it's... Are you... People are hooing Warner right now?
[55:50.39]Are you kidding me?
[55:52.63]We're getting a lot of hoo mega lulls right now.
[55:54.45]That's not... What are you talking about?
[55:58.10]This is where that, this is the Oor Oor Oor guy.
[56:00.76]This is the guy that makes that noise.
[56:02.30]How dare you?
[56:08.90]Our final contestant I think is going to really make people a little angry.
[56:13.05]Some of you are expecting somebody else.
[56:15.31]And that's not who you're getting.
[56:16.11]Who you are getting is Oops.
[56:27.21]It's the wrong outfit It's the Tasmanian devil.
[56:31.21]It's the wrong outfit though.
[56:32.09]I put I put the wrong outfit on They're they are gonna look a little different when they're in the ring But if the Tasmanian devil It's no I promise it's not the worst character I screwed up I messed up and I'm I the it won't be there I
[56:56.59]Make each sound?
[56:57.71]No.
[57:00.59]Welcome to Tasmanian Devil.
[57:01.69]This is a battle of the sound effects.
[57:04.56]The sound effects I probably did the most this year.
[57:06.44]Besides doi doi doi.
[57:07.56]Doi doi doi robbed.
[57:08.56]Well, that's too bad.
[57:09.34]Wait till 2022's Rumble.
[57:15.08]There are no rules in this match.
[57:16.14]You can hurt each other as much as you want.
[57:19.17]Which, I mean, who really cares?
[57:20.73]Hopefully somebody throws a fucking table at somebody's head.
[57:26.77]We have Armin.
[57:28.13]The la-la dog.
[57:31.48]And the Tasmanian devil.
[57:32.58]There we go.
[57:33.36]There it is.
[57:34.42]Hardcore match.
[57:36.28]Bring it on.
[57:40.10]Nothing matters here.
[57:41.77]It's just a battle to the death.
[57:43.27]I don't think it's elimination.
[57:48.01]I think it's just whoever pins wins.
[57:51.12]I'm not sure you can do predictions on this one either.
[57:53.33]Already outside the ring, La La Dog, the two animals are fighting outside.
[57:59.17]It's bizarre that the La La Dog can handle the Tasmanian Devil considering the La La Dog is... I'd say 150 pounds lighter than a Tasmanian Devil.
[58:07.13]Maybe not.
[58:09.05]You're not gonna end it already, are you?
[58:10.79]No.
[58:13.23]La La Dog?
[58:15.15]I would say was worst, most hated sound effect I did when I first did it.
[58:19.42]And turned out to be everyone's fan favorite now.
[58:22.64]Uh, it gets requested.
[58:23.54]He's breaking Armin's neck.
[58:27.02]Uh, I get requested to do Lala more than any sound effect.
[58:30.44]And all of you hated it when I first did it, so... Sorry that, you know... You need to trust me.
[58:38.77]I thought he was gonna punch the referee in the face.
[58:41.75]And out goes Tasmanian Devil to the outside of the ring.
[58:43.47]Now we're gonna... Ooh!
[58:47.56]I'm sorry.
[58:48.48]If I get to... It's 2022 in like four hours.
[58:51.09]Let me have this for like another hour or two.
[58:54.33]Just for like another hour.
[58:55.25]I promise I'll try not to ever do these sounds ever again.
[58:57.65]This is my way to get it out of my system and never think about it again.
[59:00.35]So let me just get over it.
[59:05.02]I'm hoping we see some weapons here.
[59:08.45]Maybe Armin might take out his... God, I've seen the anime and I know everything about it.
[59:14.25]I just don't know what they're called.
[59:15.61]The stuff that they wear when they attach it to trees and they fly around.
[59:18.71]Oh, he's going for it.
[59:21.13]What's he going to get?
[59:22.13]He's got himself a stick.
[59:23.73]And he missed completely.
[59:25.53]Missed completely again.
[59:26.91]Armin was never a fighter.
[59:28.98]Armin was always the brains and the strategist.
[59:31.62]He was never the one that picked up the sword.
[59:36.50]Two complete whiffs.
[59:40.61]We're paying a lot of attention to outside, but not the inside and what's happening.
[59:43.71]They keep just throwing each other... Big pow... Holy shit!
[59:49.78]Oh my god!
[59:52.24]He just threw him across the ring.
[59:53.28]Going under is... Actually, is... Gonna get something from under the ring.
[59:57.56]Is it gonna be a bat?
[59:59.32]Is it gonna be a... What are you doing?
[60:01.82]You can't find... What is... What are you, stupid?
[60:03.44]There's like a hundred items under there.
[60:05.90]He's got a bat.
[60:07.70]He's got a bat!
[60:08.80]Oh my god.
[60:13.91]Useless.
[60:17.23]4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[60:18.97]Ooh.
[60:21.13]You gave him a neck massage for 15 seconds.
[60:23.75]Oh, no.
[60:25.48]Don't let him win right now, please.
[60:29.04]Armin's got the kendo stick.
[60:35.66]He wouldn't even hit with it.
[60:39.56]I think he hit him both.
[60:40.62]I don't know.
[60:44.77]Armin, you're supposed to... Come on, Armin.
[60:47.07]You're not supposed to be aggressive like that.
[60:52.74]Two weapons in the ring right now.
[60:54.14]And on the Lala dog.
[60:56.12]Now on top, punching him in the face over and over again.
[61:00.10]While the Tasmanian Devil's in the corner.
[61:03.28]And Aaron... Oh, big move by Aaron.
[61:06.06]Armin, whatever.
[61:06.71]I think we're going to see potentially some weapon usage here.
[61:15.96]Oh, he missed.
[61:16.92]Big whiff right there on the Tasmanian Devil.
[61:19.08]Kicks him into the groin, I think.
[61:20.82]Big clothesline by Armin.
[61:23.04]Oh, the dog has a weapon.
[61:27.33]No, doesn't want to use it.
[61:29.29]He tripped.
[61:29.77]I think he just tripped over it.
[61:36.71]Reverse chin breaker there.
[61:39.23]Big DDT.
[61:42.88]Now you gotta hit him in the head with a bat and then you gotta pin him.
[61:45.94]Everyone's so tired right now.
[61:48.70]But no, take him all the way across.
[61:50.18]Uh-huh.
[61:52.29]Go into the corner and... Nice move.
[61:55.47]Alright, Tasmanian Devil's got the bat now.
[61:59.79]Lala going for the pin.
[62:01.03]Tasmanian Devil not gonna let that happen.
[62:05.13]I think there are tables under the ring too, so I don't know what they're gonna do.
[62:10.23]Big scoop slam.
[62:13.99]I think there's ladders, there's tables, there's all kinds of crazy shit under the ring.
[62:16.91]It looks like Lala might be going to get something.
[62:19.76]And... Well, that was way softer than I thought it was going to be.
[62:25.52]Can they make a table tower?
[62:26.72]I think they can do something like that.
[62:30.14]Everybody is so tired.
[62:31.36]Ooh, oh, ooh, ooh, has a big advantage here.
[62:34.08]If he can get Taz on the ground, I think this is it.
[62:40.11]This actually could be it.
[62:42.95]Oh, Armin's back up.
[62:44.91]Got the weapon again.
[62:45.63]Oh, this is so dumb.
[62:48.82]Just keep the weapon with you.
[62:50.28]Carry it with you.
[62:51.10]Finally, somebody just hold on to it.
[62:52.46]Don't put it on the ground.
[62:54.86]Did he miss?
[62:56.30]Oh, shit.
[63:00.83]Oh, he is just going rage mode on Werner right now.
[63:05.63]That could be it.
[63:10.83]No, throw him out of the ring.
[63:13.29]He's got a bone to pick with him right now for some reason.
[63:15.63]I don't know why.
[63:18.01]Armin now searching for something.
[63:19.45]He's got a ladder.
[63:23.48]Ladder going into the ring.
[63:24.96]Where did, um... Where's Taz?
[63:27.44]Oh, outside.
[63:27.92]Okay, there it is.
[63:30.12]Ladder getting set up.
[63:30.97]I wonder, Armin, could we could see some theatrics here?
[63:34.59]He's thinking about what he wants to do.
[63:35.95]He might put it up and jump off out to the outside of the ring, which would be insane.
[63:40.81]But it looks like he's stuck.
[63:43.15]His brain got frozen for a second.
[63:47.05]Those of you that want to know, the AI in these WWE games is about the intelligence level of a baby squirrel.
[63:55.62]It's some of the worst.
[63:56.72]They're just so brain dead.
[63:58.60]Big!
[63:59.04]Oh my god, that was a huge move by the Tasmanian Devil.
[64:01.65]Break this up!
[64:02.75]Break it up!
[64:08.50]He almost just won it right there.
[64:12.22]Werner going under the ring now.
[64:15.24]That's a... Oh, that's a steel chair.
[64:16.66]This is going to put somebody in the hospital.
[64:18.66]He's going to put him in the hospital.
[64:23.82]Lala outside.
[64:25.71]Not getting up.
[64:30.03]Werner.
[64:30.37]Trying to find his next target, his next victim.
[64:33.11]It's going to be the Tasmanian.
[64:33.85]He's up right in the head.
[64:34.57]Steel chair shot right in the forehead.
[64:38.31]Now what?
[64:39.73]He's wedging the chair into the corner.
[64:41.49]This could get ugly.
[64:46.21]No, he's gonna hit him.
[64:48.60]No, not even close.
[64:51.88]Somebody's gonna run into that chair accidentally.
[64:58.53]I love when they use the weapons.
[65:00.85]It's so stupid.
[65:07.88]I don't know who's gonna win this.
[65:09.16]He's going for a sharpshooter.
[65:10.94]You gotta break that up.
[65:11.78]This could be a tap out right now.
[65:13.50]Break it up, Lala.
[65:15.70]Nice job.
[65:16.92]Sludge hammer.
[65:19.41]Armin's got a sludge hammer.
[65:22.29]Didn't know who to use it on.
[65:24.09]What the fuck was that?
[65:27.09]What was that?
[65:28.41]Why did he just do that?
[65:30.46]What?
[65:32.98]What the hell was that?
[65:37.08]He just screamed at him.
[65:41.40]And now he's got like streamers on his back.
[65:43.70]What is going on?
[65:44.32]He's got caught.
[65:49.49]Oh, he's going full sicko mode.
[65:54.41]Do falls count anywhere?
[65:55.59]I don't think they do.
[65:56.31]I read that from chat, by the way, so don't be mad at me if you didn't think it was funny.
[66:03.70]I read that from chat.
[66:07.86]Where's the chair?
[66:08.52]That's a good question.
[66:13.77]I think Lala's going to put it away here.
[66:20.73]Nope.
[66:22.79]They're all so tired.
[66:25.65]If anybody goes for a pin, that's it.
[66:27.28]Armin's getting a little pumped up here.
[66:30.54]I say go for the bat, hit him in the head, and then cover him.
[66:36.00]Oh, he's just choking him with his boot.
[66:39.16]-2 for stealing content.
[66:40.46]I didn't... What are you talking about?
[66:41.30]I read that.
[66:48.12]I hope Armin loses.
[66:51.07]Well, you might see your opportunity right here.
[66:55.77]Oh, everyone's back in the ring again.
[67:06.10]Cover him.
[67:06.64]Hit him.
[67:07.64]Cover him.
[67:07.98]This is it.
[67:12.48]Oh, not quite.
[67:15.92]He can't believe it either.
[67:17.30]He's so shocked.
[67:18.38]He can't believe it.
[67:19.12]Alright, Armin, get up.
[67:32.71]No.
[67:34.97]Is this it?
[67:35.35]How is this going to end?
[67:39.80]Weapon.
[67:40.77]Cast- Oh!
[67:42.37]Stole it from Armin, but watch out for the- I don't even know what to even say.
[67:45.73]They all have weapons.
[67:46.99]That's all you need to know.
[67:50.67]Stop putting the weapons on the ground!
[68:02.63]There are three weapons on the ground.
[68:04.81]Just pick one up.
[68:05.67]You don't have to steal it from the other person.
[68:14.44]Big clothesline.
[68:16.80]I think that could be the end.
[68:19.61]It's not the end.
[68:20.31]Just pin him.
[68:23.39]Stop being so stupid.
[68:27.73]What are you doing?
[68:30.73]Why would you walk away from that?
[68:35.31]Big reversal.
[68:36.31]Hit him once and it's over.
[68:39.13]Double reversal.
[68:41.61]Triple reversal.
[68:44.28]Just hit him!
[68:48.48]Please pin him, Armin.
[68:50.95]Pin him, please.
[68:53.21]Please pin somebody.
[68:58.53]Pin someone!
[69:03.76]Toss him out of the ring, for God's sake.
[69:10.60]That move doesn't even hurt!
[69:13.44]I've jumped into a hotel bed harder than that.
[69:17.17]It doesn't hurt.
[69:17.95]There's nothing wrong with what you just did.
[69:19.87]Chug him out.
[69:26.92]Chug him out.
[69:27.24]Here we go.
[69:27.60]Here we go.
[69:28.00]Go, go, go.
[69:28.56]No.
[69:37.23]Where's Armin?
[69:37.79]Oh, he's outside.
[69:38.31]Outside.
[69:41.21]These are spoilers for Attack on Titan.
[69:44.43]I don't know what just happened, but that could be it.
[69:48.19]Too busy getting a weapon and he's going to lose.
[69:50.27]That's it.
[69:51.07]That's definitely it.
[69:52.03]As he gets a table.
[69:53.29]No, that's it.
[69:57.31]Werner Von Braun from The Simpsons arcade game.
[69:59.47]Ladies and gentlemen, is your sound of the whatever.
[70:03.77]It's one of the sounds I made last year.
[70:07.96]One of the many sounds I've made.
[70:17.47]Very nice match.
[70:20.75]Congratulations to Warner.
[70:24.22]I get to do it one more time.
[70:26.52]And I won't do it ever again for the rest of the year, I promise.
[70:36.56]I won't do that ever again.
[70:37.80]You'll never hear me make that sound ever again.
[70:40.71]One more, wait, one more, one more.
[70:43.59]Okay, I'll never do it ever again.
[70:50.01]Alright, let's get back to some categories.
[70:53.17]That was two matches.
[70:54.39]We still have six more to do, including the Rumble.
[70:58.90]We're going to go over here for now.
[71:01.50]I hope it does not crash.
[71:03.34]I'd be very sad if it does.
[71:04.70]We're going to leave it.
[71:05.34]I'm going to be incredibly upset if it crashes.
[71:13.63]Cross your fingers and pray.
[71:15.25]Okay.
[71:16.53]Alright, we've got some categories.
[71:17.45]The next one we're going to do, we're going to go through, this is worst face incoming.
[71:20.60]If you're new to the channel, worst face is usually a category that.
[71:25.94]And when I'm in the corner, when I do my facecam, have you noticed that when I put facecam on, every time I've had facecam, there's been a nominee for this.
[71:37.27]Anytime I put my facecam on, people nominate a worst face that I've made.
[71:42.82]They range from excited to angry to like blowing bubbles or something.
[71:47.40]I don't know, whatever it is.
[71:49.46]So these are your nominees for worst face of the year.
[72:04.03]What does this guy look like?
[72:08.69]Alright, there you go.
[72:09.95]You got what you wanted, everybody that was here.
[72:12.11]You got the imposterous fucking stupid-ass sus face.
[72:16.57]That, you got it.
[72:18.03]I just realized that's what I just did.
[72:19.99]Ah, Douglas!
[72:28.45]Somebody came in the room.
[72:29.99]The T-Rex walked in.
[72:30.88]It didn't matter what I was doing.
[72:33.10]I had to be very still or I was dead.
[72:36.98]Or you don't have a place to put your cardboard cutout of Jerma985.
[72:42.00]I guess it's just gonna go over here and lean against the wall while I clean the fucking room.
[72:47.55]There's 50 subs?
[72:48.71]I missed 50 subs.
[72:49.83]Well, thank you.
[72:50.47]Ooh, that one was bad.
[72:55.59]That looks like somebody's, like, fucking threatening me to, like, like...
[73:06.40]Yeah, you're a dance.
[73:09.24]Does it look like somebody's going to fucking kill me off camera?
[73:15.82]Oh, my funny bone.
[73:17.00]Oh, my funny bone.
[73:17.86]My funny bone.
[73:18.36]I just hit my funny bone in my armistice.
[73:29.39]Ain't sauce sucks.
[73:33.21]What do we do?
[73:33.61]What do we do with him?
[73:36.18]You decide.
[73:36.98]What do we do with him?
[73:38.02]What do we do with him?
[73:40.10]What do we do with him?
[73:43.22]That's really cross-eyed.
[73:45.06]What do we do with that guy?
[73:47.20]What do we do with him?
[73:50.08]What do we do with that guy?
[73:52.02]Doesn't want me to do it.
[73:55.95]You have a huge inventory in this game.
[74:04.29]That's good.
[74:10.13]It's like, oh, that guy is... Oh, wait a minute.
[74:19.94]I was trying to get... I was trying to get it... Somebody, like, snatched me.
[74:29.94]Somebody snatched me.
[74:31.10]I was in the middle, and, like, before they took the photo, somebody, like, fucking snatched me and pulled me.
[74:36.86]Look at that mouth.
[74:42.78]Some good ones this year.
[74:47.54]Okay.
[74:49.10]So, the winner of the worst face of the year.
[74:53.42]I actually don't know.
[74:55.41]I don't remember who won this.
[74:57.65]I don't know who won this.
[74:59.73]We're going to find out together.
[75:10.33]It was close.
[75:12.55]But Eye Contact Whopper Bite was number one with 22 stop.
[75:25.10]Eye Contact Whopper Bite was 22% of the vote.
[75:28.96]Cartoon Anger and Accidental Sus Face are your winners.
[75:34.11]Hey, I made some deity very angry.
[75:37.55]Eye Contact Whopper, 22% of the vote.
[75:42.05]Which, I can, I get it.
[75:44.69]I can understand.
[75:46.59]Nobody likes to watch other people eat, and nobody likes to have eye contact while somebody else eats.
[75:50.01]I don't, I can't, I get it.
[75:55.51]I really do.
[75:57.25]I hate sitting across from somebody, and we both have dinners in front of us, and we're both eating.
[76:06.22]I, like, oh, no, fucking get out of here.
[76:07.80]Let's go somewhere else.
[76:09.74]Let's just get takeout and sit on the couch.
[76:12.18]I don't fucking want to go to a goddamn restaurant.
[76:14.08]The only time I like going to a restaurant, seriously, is if there's like eight people and everyone's like, oh, did you try this?
[76:19.96]Try the lobster.
[76:21.26]Oh, yeah.
[76:22.08]Did you get any of that?
[76:23.26]Hey, you got to try this drink.
[76:24.28]And like, everyone's just talking and yelling at each other and shit.
[76:27.99]I like going to a restaurant with like six people.
[76:31.29]Sweating?
[76:33.22]Holy fucking moly.
[76:35.32]Jesus Christ.
[76:37.50]Jesus Christ.
[76:38.46]I gotta get this off.
[76:39.78]Jesus Christ.
[76:41.99]What?
[76:43.15]What happened?
[76:44.79]What happened?
[76:45.33]I gotta get this off.
[76:47.03]I gotta get this off.
[76:47.91]What happened?
[76:52.81]What happened?
[76:53.53]What's going on recently?
[76:54.53]I've been sweating my ass off.
[76:57.13]Hold on.
[76:57.33]Let me turn on my urinal.
[76:59.05]Let me turn the urinal on.
[77:00.01]I think I need it.
[77:10.63]Turn the urinal on.
[77:13.77]Jesus.
[77:19.11]My God.
[77:19.86]Turn on your fa- I just turned it on.
[77:24.84]Look, alright, I'm sitting- look it, let me explain.
[77:26.98]I'm sitting down in a chair, and I'm like, I'm sweating and shit, like I got this ring light now, I got this new ring light, I'm in like full lighting, this is not like a normal scenario, I'm out at a dinner table with six people having fun.
[77:38.35]Anyways, uh, there you're- there's your winner.
[77:41.40]But no, I- I- I like going to a restaurant with like five or six people.
[77:44.16]You get to converse, you get to share, you get to talk, you get to point at the person all the way at the end.
[77:50.70]Hey, oh, dude, did you- did you try the chicken thighs?
[77:53.80]And they go, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[77:55.56]And you go, yeah, man, that's my guy over there in the corner.
[77:58.56]I like that environment.
[77:59.60]I hate the other environment.
[78:04.31]I'm sweating, so who cares?
[78:06.19]Coming up next is best dancing.
[78:09.53]Sometimes I get on camera and I decide to move a little bit, shake a little bit.
[78:14.35]What do you want about?
[78:15.91]Those that get it, get it.
[78:16.73]Those that don't, they never will.
[78:20.84]So this is for the best dancing of the year.
[78:25.04]I don't know how many times I've danced this year total.
[78:28.67]We're about to find out.
[78:29.57]And no, I swear to God, I'm not a lizard person.
[78:31.13]I just blinked weird for a second.
[78:32.33]Alright, these are the nominees for best dancing of the year.
[78:36.68]I actually forget what was nominated.
[78:40.88]Let's find out.
[78:50.66]Alright, there's a guy right now going like this, like, way in the back.
[79:03.63]There's a guy just, like, fucking freaking out over there.
[79:06.39]There's something for... The door's, like, bending down, too.
[79:08.72]You know, like, it's always just like... It's like...
[79:14.68]And their hairs are going fucking crazy.
[79:17.76]You didn't let me choreograph this with me.
[79:19.54]I wasn't here at the rehearsal.
[79:21.48]Oh, fucking whatever.
[79:52.53]Alright, I'm tired.
[79:53.31]I'm done.
[79:54.41]Okay.
[79:55.07]I've trended on TikTok three different times in the last fucking three years.
[79:58.89]Okay?
[80:02.50]Bring this one to the fucking front page.
[80:04.74]Oh, this one.
[80:05.10]The goddamn orangutan.
[80:05.84]Get on the front page.
[80:11.84]I'm sweaty as hell on this one, too.
[80:13.53]Why am I sweating so much?
[80:16.11]I swear to God, this is like a new thing for the last six months.
[80:18.51]Why am I so sweaty now?
[80:19.55]I want them to see me Fortnite dancing before they die.
[80:27.85]Come on, they need to see this before they go.
[80:36.93]Oh my God, that was epic.
[80:41.13]I'll give you the shake.
[80:43.67]It's the old fucking 36-year-old shake.
[80:59.04]The guy that paid $1,200 for a front row seat.
[81:05.36]What's this guy doing?
[81:18.19]Put the TV down for a second.
[81:20.07]Go have a good day.
[81:22.21]Go ahead and take it.
[81:23.31]I'm not paying fine.
[81:23.91]You can take it.
[81:24.29]I don't know if you've heard of Tic Tac or whatever.
[81:26.76]Don't Tic Tac.
[81:28.19]If you're gonna TikTok me, fine, but I gotta do this.
[81:30.35]Are you TikToking?
[81:31.79]Are you TikToking now?
[81:33.13]Uh, yeah, I think so.
[81:33.93]I don't know how it works.
[81:39.25]Milton in the back is so funny.
[81:40.51]There.
[81:40.79]Fucking leave, please.
[81:43.35]Alright.
[81:44.27]Alright.
[81:44.55]And I'm the one in handcuffs, bro?
[81:46.67]And he took us all by the hand.
[81:51.41]And then we saw him.
[81:52.61]And then he started dancing.
[81:56.51]When God came down to the land in the land.
[82:01.96]I can't believe what's happening right now.
[82:22.15]Somebody said something really, really important.
[82:24.81]And I have to address it because I'm going to address these things.
[82:27.53]And yeah, I've taken it off a little bit and I don't want anyone to see my sweat box.
[82:32.91]Somebody said something really important.
[82:34.93]They said, I love how Jerma's interpretation of dancing is doing different poses.
[82:44.72]I mean, what even is dancing?
[82:48.56]Dancing is just doing different poses in succession to make a new animation, like a new human animation.
[82:54.83]How is that any different?
[82:57.45]That's what dancing is.
[82:59.49]It's doing different poses in a row to create a dance.
[83:05.61]If I were to go like this, that's me doing different poses and animating with keyframes in between.
[83:14.10]Anyways.
[83:18.90]the winner that's not the right sound the winner at the 2021 best dancing award goes to what do you think what do you think stop playing the among us I'm the imposter sound out of here I don't want to hear that ever again
[83:44.16]break dancing with 27% of the vote.
[83:47.56]And then in second place with 20% was the goddamn orangutan, the TikTok one.
[83:52.90]And then 12%, no rehearsal, no problem.
[83:59.03]So break dancing during the dollhouse was the winner at 27% of the vote.
[84:01.25]A lot.
[84:02.15]Fair enough.
[84:10.15]I don't even want to do this one, but we're going to do it.
[84:11.57]This is worse, Peter.
[84:15.04]There are a lot of people here watching, and I need to give context to this because I feel like you'd probably just think I was a fucking psycho if I didn't.
[84:24.84]So, pretty much.
[84:34.14]We're at the end game now, Peter.
[84:36.85]Damon was crashed to punish me for doing what I just did and saying what I just said.
[84:41.91]It's the mustache.
[84:43.05]Peter.
[84:43.74]Peter, it's the mustache.
[84:45.56]You're probably also probably wondering if Worst Peter's on there.
[84:48.24]Of course it is.
[84:49.68]I don't think I said it once.
[84:50.56]I think that's the only time I said it the whole year.
[84:54.68]Is this on there?
[84:55.14]It has to be on there.
[84:55.88]I don't even care.
[84:57.52]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[84:59.14]Welcome to episode one of Dremocraft.
[85:00.96]The series where I play Minecraft.
[85:02.68]Peter, this is going to be a single player Let's Play.
[85:05.41]Oh, it turned into a different animal.
[85:09.23]Oh, Peter!
[85:10.65]Keith!
[85:11.23]Mark!
[85:13.67]Zane.
[85:15.27]Evan.
[85:18.27]How could we have forgotten Peter?
[85:20.29]Pleased to make your acquaintance.
[85:21.93]I was a rancher here for years.
[85:24.59]But I can... Hey, Peter.
[85:27.81]Sorry.
[85:28.07]You have your own empire.
[85:29.45]Cool.
[85:29.71]Oh, this is cool.
[85:33.25]We're in the endgame now, Peter.
[85:34.29]So, I mean, this is, like, cool.
[85:37.13]Ahem.
[85:44.94]I swear to fucking God, if I play that sound again, I'm gonna freak out.
[85:50.34]The award for worst beater of the year goes to... Why would... Okay, I have a question.
[86:02.42]Why was this such a huge percentage?
[86:06.59]I don't understand.
[86:08.64]Obama reads JermaCraft, Peter, with 41% of the vote.
[86:14.20]They were all the same exact thing.
[86:15.93]All of them were the same.
[86:17.09]There was no difference.
[86:18.65]Why was that so much higher than all the others?
[86:23.43]41%?
[86:25.94]Did you all collectively get in Discord or something and say, oh, hey, by the way, we're all going to vote for the Obama one?
[86:33.68]End game, Peter.
[86:34.64]And then, hey, Peter.
[86:36.16]Who knows what the fuck that one was?
[86:37.86]Who cares, though?
[86:40.52]Does it matter?
[86:47.52]I think I just paper-cutted my neck.
[86:50.55]Well, the price we pay for fucking showmanship.
[86:53.53]Coming up next, we have Auto.
[86:55.95]We have Best Auto Moment.
[87:01.38]Which is every time that the dog has been on.
[87:03.76]I got a dog, Otto.
[87:04.52]He's a little wiener dog.
[87:06.86]I'm fine.
[87:07.50]Look, there's nothing.
[87:08.00]It's fine.
[87:08.58]I'm fine.
[87:10.47]This is best Otto moment when my dog was on screen.
[87:15.35]Or maybe not.
[87:16.65]Maybe it's just when Otto was mentioned.
[87:18.31]Or Otto was like a, you know, some type of, in spirit, right?
[87:24.47]Here are the nominees for best Otto.
[87:28.42]I can do that better.
[87:29.88]I can do that better.
[87:31.53]Here are the nominees for Best Otto Moment.
[87:39.03]What's that?
[87:45.02]What's that?
[87:47.32]Oh, it's... Wait, is that... Otto?
[87:54.82]Oh, look at it!
[87:55.86]It's Otto!
[88:00.95]We'll go to Tokyo.
[88:05.29]Yeah, I want to do the mango.
[88:08.07]Oh, nice, Otto.
[88:11.01]I want to sneeze.
[88:11.71]I'm not about to sneeze.
[88:13.11]I'm going to pet Mr. Otto.
[88:13.93]Scratchy bum.
[88:17.30]Do you have a scratchy bum?
[88:20.68]Do you?
[88:21.02]Do you?
[88:22.78]Do you?
[88:23.82]Oh, my goodness.
[88:24.86]I got to get out of the way.
[88:26.28]He's doing something cute.
[88:31.84]Hello, Mr. Toph.
[88:32.34]Hey.
[88:32.58]What are you doing over there?
[88:35.48]What are you doing over there?
[88:37.54]See?
[88:39.44]I'm petting the dog.
[88:40.56]Hello, Aja.
[88:43.94]What the fuck?
[88:44.88]Are you dead?
[88:46.34]Nope.
[88:47.12]Almost, though.
[88:51.89]He's coming.
[88:53.21]He's coming.
[88:57.63]Are you petting him?
[89:00.11]If you die right now.
[89:01.52]I'm going to die, you understand?
[89:03.78]Bobbleheads?
[89:08.77]Oh!
[89:10.07]Otto!
[89:12.17]I can't believe there's an Otto!
[89:14.45]Oh, I miss- It's a dachshund!
[89:21.58]Oh, it's Otto!
[89:24.88]It's little Otto!
[89:26.52]Where's Otto?
[89:36.47]Who's a good boy?
[89:38.55]Otto.
[89:38.89]You guys wanna see something funny?
[89:45.29]That bed was like $200.
[89:46.09]That bed was like $30.
[89:49.31]Move out of the way for Otto.
[89:53.37]It's the same clip.
[89:55.43]Except he's in the $200 bed.
[89:59.43]That's my favorite part about that.
[90:01.37]He was in... Okay.
[90:03.16]Whatever.
[90:04.88]Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of Best Auto Moment goes to Orange Blanket Auto with 25% of the vote.
[90:21.11]Really?
[90:22.95]Wow.
[90:25.51]Pet Auto was 15%, which I would assume that would be higher.
[90:30.01]And then Auto Sneezes Off Camera, 14%.
[90:35.32]Orange Blanket with 25% of the vote.
[90:37.70]By the way, keep in mind that these have been rounded up.
[90:41.12]So Orange Blanket probably got like 25.9% of the vote.
[90:44.98]So just for your viewership, you're able to see and process because I need to have round numbers.
[90:54.99]That just tried to kill me.
[90:56.55]This just tried to wrap around my neck and kill me.
[91:00.80]Round numbers are easier for me.
[91:03.98]So hopefully they're easier for you.
[91:06.17]Alright, we'll do one more.
[91:06.91]We're going to get through this one right now.
[91:11.16]This is the last, I think, of the shit categories.
[91:13.65]I think this is the last of the dumb, shitty categories.
[91:19.56]I have to warn some of the new viewers here.
[91:21.10]I know there's 36,000 fucking people here.
[91:23.06]Listen to me.
[91:23.98]You're probably going to want to leave the stream after this.
[91:26.88]But stay.
[91:27.92]I promise that this community is like one of the funnest communities I've ever had the pleasure of being part of.
[91:34.17]You're going to probably leave the stream during this.
[91:36.87]Because you're probably like, I hate this sound.
[91:38.19]I don't like this.
[91:38.73]This guy sucks.
[91:39.37]I hate listening to this guy.
[91:40.95]Why is he doing this?
[91:42.59]This is the best errand of the year.
[91:44.45]We just saw Armin play in the Rumble.
[91:47.04]I'm going to give you exactly what I mean by this.
[91:50.00]So Best Eren is... Okay, how do I explain this?
[91:57.22]So in the Attack on Titan English dub, the actor that does Armin, and Mikasa too, if you've ever seen Attack on Titan, they're always yelling for Eren.
[92:09.51]They're always yelling his name, and they're always doing it very loudly and very... You know what?
[92:18.05]Whatever.
[92:18.69]You understand.
[92:19.93]Thanks for watching.
[92:24.05]TL;DR, I just like, I don't know, it just stuck in my brain and I had to say it all the time.
[92:27.24]And I swear to God I say this every day.
[92:35.14]That's a good, you're right.
[92:38.13]Freeze.
[92:40.49]Freeze.
[92:43.01]It's midnight EST in like three minutes.
[92:46.16]Freeze.
[92:47.86]Nobody move.
[92:49.62]Oh my god, I need the thing.
[92:51.02]Was it Lang Syne?
[92:56.28]Okay, I gotta get ready.
[92:58.14]It's in two minutes.
[93:06.27]This is a guitar.
[93:10.17]What's it called?
[93:10.61]Old Lang Syne?
[93:13.33]Old Lang Syne?
[93:19.07]Why are they all this?
[93:20.11]It's all this one.
[93:21.40]Is this a popular one?
[93:29.14]Two minutes until New Year's on East Coast.
[93:32.18]Auld Lang Syne.
[93:33.26]Auld Lang Syne.
[93:40.13]This is like Scottish.
[93:42.75]I just need Auld Lang Syne.
[93:44.65]I just need just like royalty free with no lyrics.
[93:49.08]Royalty free, no lyrics.
[93:53.82]Old Lang Syne, royalty free.
[93:58.30]Okay, alright.
[93:59.34]Okay, here we go.
[94:02.48]Welcome to 2021 in two minutes.
[94:03.58]We have two minutes.
[94:06.20]It's a Scottish poem, it is?
[94:07.73]I don't want to even see that fucking underarm bullshit.
[94:14.33]We got one minute.
[94:15.35]We gotta count this down.
[94:19.86]We're almost there.
[94:21.10]We're getting close.
[94:23.46]These are like almost done.
[94:24.42]Should I take these off?
[94:27.96]We're probably going to be able to count down the Pacific one too, because there's like lots left for me to do here.
[94:33.35]30 seconds till New Year's.
[94:39.79]I'm in Pacific, so it's not New Year's for me, but we'll celebrate East Coast nonetheless.
[94:45.86]Here we go.
[94:46.32]The ball's about to drop in New York City.
[94:53.22]Do it in your Boston accent?
[94:54.32]Alright, yeah.
[94:55.08]You want me to do it in Auld Lang Syne in my Boston accent?

[95:40.95]And all the revolution with the soccer team and the Bruins.
[95:47.06]And fuck you for fucking talking shit to me about my mother behind my back that one time that year.
[95:53.24]And I fucking never forgot.

[98:14.54]Oh shit, you're gonna know who I am!
[98:17.00]What I meant to say was... That's not funny.
[98:23.08]I'm doing an impression of Armin from Attack on Titan.
[98:27.50]I'm just doing it.
[98:28.40]I have to.
[98:30.50]I'll do it over here so it's not as loud.
[98:33.23]Eren!
[98:33.93]I'm sorry.
[98:34.49]I have no idea.
[98:36.59]Do you know what it's like to fucking live with me?
[98:40.05]Oh!
[98:42.95]Eren!
[98:44.51]No, Eren!
[98:46.11]Eren!
[98:47.67]Eren, run away, Eren.
[98:49.97]Do Hercule.
[98:51.13]Oh, I can do that one.
[98:52.81]I love that character in Attack on Titan.
[98:55.79]Oh, right.
[98:56.25]I love when that character shows up and says, I am the strongest person on Earth.
[99:00.49]Now, what do you know about that one, Goku?
[99:05.66]Eren, Eren, Eren.
[99:07.40]He didn't say it in the funny voice.
[99:11.97]No, that wasn't even the right one.
[99:13.17]There you go.
[99:15.17]You get that like once a week.
[99:16.97]Those whose eyes are clouded by fear are besieged by the ghosts that haunt them.
[99:24.82]Eren!
[99:25.20]Eren!
[99:25.76]Eren!
[99:26.94]Eren!

[99:37.37]Eren!
[99:37.89]Eren!
[99:42.03]Okay, there you go.
[99:42.93]I know you said shut up.
[99:44.97]You must be one of the two.
[99:45.91]You should have voted no.
[99:47.29]Why did you want me to do that?
[99:49.45]76% of you told me to do that.
[100:03.18]The winner this year.
[100:06.94]And the only year.
[100:12.29]For best Aaron is at 17% of the vote.
[100:19.36]76% of you voted for this, the last one you just heard.
[100:21.68]It was bad.
[100:22.30]I didn't stop.
[100:24.36]I just kept going.
[100:25.10]I kept doing it.
[100:26.82]I didn't pause.
[100:29.28]Microphone Aaron was at 13, and Goku Aaron was at 12.
[100:40.33]Alright, we're going to do one more.
[100:41.59]No, no, we're not.
[100:43.52]No, we're not.
[100:45.44]Oh, my God.
[100:45.92]Yeah, we should.
[100:46.36]Yeah.
[100:47.54]We're going to do two more.
[100:49.22]Alright.
[100:51.26]Sometimes on this stream, I like to do impressions.
[100:55.16]Sometimes on this stream, I like to do impressions.
[100:57.46]Whether that's Obama.
[101:01.73]Or whether that's... Or whether that's... I like to do impressions.
[101:06.81]I like to just kind of say things and do things, right?
[101:10.73]Sometimes they're better than others.
[101:12.29]Sometimes impressions are bad.
[101:16.27]I'm just giving context to people.
[101:18.89]That's not me doing an impression.
[101:20.89]That was context.
[101:24.07]Sometimes I do impressions and we're going to start with the best.
[101:27.33]So these are the best.
[101:28.35]No, we're going to start with the worst because I want people to see how good I am later.
[101:32.25]These are the worst impressions of the year.
[101:35.43]Sometimes they're good.
[101:37.49]Sometimes they're bad.
[101:41.54]I can't tell you how to feel either way.
[101:44.56]But we're going to start with the worst.
[101:51.37]No.
[101:53.47]Let's start with the best foot forward.
[101:55.21]Best foot forward.
[101:56.15]These are the nominees for best impression of the year.
[102:00.95]Here we go.
[102:01.74]Best impression.
[102:11.20]Hey!
[102:12.24]Every... It's... Me!
[102:15.42]Everybody's favorite number one rated salesman, 1997!
[102:21.04]Oh, I'd be the little sponge who hates a truffle and denied life when you could be a big shot!
[102:28.67]Big shot!
[102:29.63]A big shot!
[102:31.13]That's right!
[102:32.03]Now's your chance to be a big shot!
[102:34.20]DM me if I'm wrong.
[102:34.96]I bet you can't do a perfect wolf howl on stream right now.
[102:42.30]Ban that guy for life.
[102:43.06]Ban that guy again if he's still here.
[102:44.42]Ban him for life.
[102:44.92]He doesn't get to come back.
[102:45.80]If he's here right now, ban him again.
[102:46.72]He does not get to come back.
[102:47.54]Ban that guy permanently.
[102:48.58]He does not get to come back.
[102:49.36]You go play the sounds that I just made.
[103:12.47]The ones I just made!
[103:14.99]BAM!
[103:16.03]I wanna hear it!
[103:16.75]Clip it, I wanna hear it!
[103:17.91]I never yelled, it was like... That's my favorite part about Harry Potter.
[103:27.08]I'd just be sitting there going like... VOD Watcher right now was able to go like this.
[103:43.57]Okay, so we're gonna play Deltarune now.
[103:47.67]We're gonna start the game now.
[103:50.25]You imitate the sounds of shoes squeaking on a basketball court.
[104:03.23]Yeah.
[104:22.88]Oh, hey guys.
[104:23.75]Hey, you ever, you ever pick up the phone and somebody, it's a wrong number and you say, oh, hey, wrong number.
[104:30.77]Hey, screw you, buddy.
[104:32.51]You know what I mean?
[104:33.69]Like, that's a +2.
[104:34.71]Car noise.
[104:53.23]This one's not going to be close.
[105:00.85]Uh...
[105:22.91]The winner for best impression of the year goes to... You probably could guess it.
[105:28.35]It was... Spamton.
[105:35.90]At 31% of the vote, Spamton.
[105:38.80]Which, I've seen a lot of people say they liked the Spamton voice.
[105:42.06]I was just kind of fucking around.
[105:46.86]If you liked it, I'm glad you did.
[105:49.00]I was just having fun.
[105:51.55]Chat chimps at 12% and then skipping through the VOD at 15% There are your best uh best impressions of the year apparently It was an interpretation.
[106:05.49]Yeah.
[106:05.89]Yeah, that's what I said.
[106:08.27]Chimps got robbed Well, you just want chimps to win because you are a chat chimp.
[106:13.75]You got bias.
[106:16.92]So with the best comes the worst.
[106:18.89]And these are the ones... It's funny because people are probably watching right now going... Dude, half of those were dog shit.
[106:26.69]Well... Just wait till you hear the ones that weren't nominated for best of the year.
[106:32.40]Wait till you see the ones that were nominated for the worst of the year.
[106:36.82]And I gotta... Okay, I have to defend myself right now.
[106:42.99]I don't, sometimes I just sit here, and I just talk, and I just like do somebody else's voice or something, and I'm not even trying to do it, I'm not trying to do an impression, I just do Donald Duck.
[106:54.64]I'm just like, alright, I'm gonna do, I'll do Donald Duck right now, that sounds like kind of a fun time.
[106:58.86]And then people go, oh hey, that sucked.
[107:00.45]And I go, alright, well then fucking nominate it already!
[107:02.57]Here are your nominees for worst impression of the year, and you all know who won, so who cares, let's go.
[107:09.75]Worst impression of the year.

[107:17.35]Welcome to episode one of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[107:22.65]This is gonna be a single-player Let's Play, and when I say Let's Play, I use that term pretty loosely, because I'm an idiot at this game.

[108:03.49]And he flies and smashes right into the side of like Cleveland's house.
[108:09.07]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[108:10.25]Welcome to episode one of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[108:14.58]This is going to be a single-player Let's Play, and I say, when I say Let's Play, I use that term pretty loosely, because I am a stupid idiot dumbass in this game.
[108:23.25]You're going to see lots of you.
[108:24.37]That's a fake one.
[108:25.73]Audition for Waluigi right now.
[108:27.31]Alright.
[108:31.69]Ah!
[108:32.93]Ah!
[108:35.49]Everybody cheated but me.
[108:37.21]Jesus Christ.
[108:38.37]This should have won.
[108:40.75]That should have won.
[108:41.89]Did I get the part?
[108:43.01]You sound like Homer Simpson today.
[108:45.53]Thanks.
[108:46.45]I appreciate that.
[108:50.01]In fear.
[108:53.67]No.
[108:54.67]No.
[108:55.17]No.
[108:55.77]No.
[108:56.35]No.
[108:56.99]No.
[108:57.55]There it is.
[108:58.89]Fuck off.
[108:59.27]I got it.
[109:00.24]Oh, Joe, Joe the Bionicle, they're never gonna make it.
[109:03.80]I don't think they're gonna make it, Joe.
[109:05.84]Chat, what do you guys think?
[109:06.98]Will you just shut up, man?
[109:10.99]What?
[109:14.27]Trying to watch the movie here.
[109:17.73]God.
[109:21.31]Of course they're gonna make it.
[109:23.87]They're the damn Bionicles.
[109:26.18]No, hear me.
[109:27.64]Morning.
[109:29.04]How are you?
[109:29.62]It should be pleased you to know that the purple Pikmin are lodged safely in my hole.
[109:33.44]That wasn't Bernie.
[109:36.58]That was supposed to be Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[109:39.16]Good morning.
[109:40.90]How are you?
[109:41.94]Fuck, that is Bernie.
[109:44.52]Good morning.
[109:45.84]How are you?
[109:46.90]How are you?
[109:48.40]Good morning.
[109:49.30]Good morning.
[109:49.90]Fuck.
[109:51.40]Did you do Tommy Lee Jones?
[109:52.48]Yeah, I'll try.
[109:57.46]You do an impression of Daniel Day-Lewis in, um... With There Will Be Blood.
[110:01.44]Sure.
[110:01.62]I actually haven't seen that movie.
[110:03.98]That's why you... Oh my god.
[110:20.79]Alright, I'm gonna... I don't think the Daniel Day-Lewis one was that bad.
[110:26.14]Can I be honest?
[110:28.32]The Daniel Day Lewis one was more like feeling and like mannerism.
[110:34.02]It was more like an emotion.
[110:36.36]It wasn't, I wasn't, you know what I mean?
[110:38.45]Whatever.
[110:42.71]By the way, anybody that does an Arnold Schwarzenegger impression, they're just going to do Bernie Sanders.
[110:49.53]Listen for it.
[110:51.77]If you can differentiate yourself
[110:54.77]From Arnold to Bernie, you got a great fucking Arnold impression.
[111:09.52]Lowest one with 21% of the vote.
[111:12.39]And then Homer Simpson with 13%.
[111:13.83]And then Chip and Dale.
[111:15.21]Chip and Dale.
[111:16.09]I think Chip and Dale was the worst.
[111:18.61]That's Cope.
[111:19.23]Yeah, that's fine.
[111:21.62]There it is.
[111:23.02]Lois is your winner with 21%.
[111:25.50]Homer Simpson, 13.
[111:26.58]Chippendale at 11.
[111:27.42]I think Chippendale was the worst by far.
[111:31.51]Chippendale was so bad, it hurt my ears listening back when I got the video to compile into OBS.
[111:40.39]It was awful.
[111:42.98]And with that, we're going to move back to Jermania.
[111:47.32]We're going to go back to the Jerma Rumble.
[111:51.28]We still have about five or six matches to do before the Rumble.
[111:54.38]So we're going to move this over here.
[111:57.81]Let's keep this going here.
[111:59.71]I hope you can't see it.
[112:00.85]Alright.
[112:01.45]I think we're good.
[112:04.19]On to the next match.
[112:09.61]This one's going to be interesting.
[112:14.41]Mitch McConnell should have been on there.
[112:16.69]I think that was last year.
[112:18.59]I think it was on last year.
[112:23.17]I just burped and I'm so glad I fucking got rid of it.
[112:28.35]I'm going to need a refill soon here.
[112:31.44]We are definitely going to count down the Pacific New Years, by the way.
[112:35.14]There's no way we don't miss it.
[112:37.04]There's so much more to do.
[112:39.78]You didn't see shit.
[112:47.90]I drink five times a year.
[112:50.81]Will you let me have this?
[112:52.67]I drink five times a year.
[112:54.39]Alright, the next is going to be a one-on-three tag match, which could be very interesting.
[113:07.13]Here we go.
[113:11.72]Our next match is a one-on-three tag match, handicap match.
[113:19.22]For those in the audience that were Dollhouse fans.
[113:23.83]This is a Dollhouse themed matchup.
[113:28.45]Our first contestant is going to be Jerma.
[113:31.23]From the Dollhouse, specifically wearing the... The championship belt.
[113:39.97]That is Dollhouse Jerma.
[113:41.75]That's true.
[113:42.66]That's not true.
[113:50.60]One half of the Jeremy?
[113:52.00]Is there another half?
[114:01.55]Yeah, that's me in the day one dollhouse outfit.
[114:08.76]And I am facing three people at the same time.
[114:13.46]Well, it's a tag match.
[114:18.41]Trying to think of who I would really be kind of annoyed with.
[114:22.91]Three people in particular.
[114:24.75]That I just, god, they got on my nerves.
[114:26.33]They were always around me.
[114:27.37]They were always causing problems.
[114:35.66]I could sense them.
[114:37.44]I heard them.
[114:38.46]I could feel them.
[114:39.92]In the room with me.
[114:45.33]And even still, when I go back and watch footage, I'm still surprised of their existence.
[114:57.69]And I don't believe it a lot of the time.
[114:59.36]People tell me, oh, no, this happened, this happened.
[115:01.50]I'm like, no, it didn't.
[115:02.12]That's so weird.
[115:07.06]And I got the belt, too.
[115:14.18]Some of you are guessing what it is, and some of you got it right.
[115:19.18]Bald is beautiful.
[115:20.08]I'm not bald, and I'm 36.
[115:22.56]Do you understand how awesome that is?
[115:25.96]I am not bald, and I'm 36.
[115:27.86]Holy smokes, I can say that.
[115:31.40]That's awesome.
[115:34.94]I probably won't make it to 40, but who knows?
[115:36.82]We'll find out.
[115:40.56]Thank you for joining me on this New Year's, by the way, and I'm doing my tuber voice because we're doing commentary on the wrestling, of course.
[115:48.06]And who I am facing is the dastardly, the sneaky, the strange, the out of the ordinary, the paralysis demon-like shadow moving people.
[116:12.09]Three of the Shadow Movers in a furniture matchup.
[116:17.50]I believe this is a tables, ladders, and chairs match.
[116:22.84]This is Shadow Mover 1.
[116:23.84]And I think they have the same entrance, so I don't know if we need to do Shadow Mover 2 and 3's entrance, but they are terrifying.
[116:31.17]Go get them.
[116:41.10]I will skip this because it's two more of the same intro.
[116:46.56]But we'll wait for the prediction to be over because I don't want to start the match yet.
[116:50.90]I don't know if I would vote for me.
[116:52.54]It's 1v3.
[117:03.42]Although you might make money if I win.
[117:04.88]That'd be great.
[117:07.84]How much pyrotechnics?
[117:08.98]Oh my god.
[117:10.06]Relax.
[117:17.90]This is using a lot of gas.
[117:20.14]Jesus.
[117:22.52]Yeah, it's three.
[117:23.14]There are three shadow movers versus me.
[117:29.68]Let's go.
[117:35.40]Let's go.
[117:38.15]Just to prove it, it's three shadow movers.
[117:40.29]Yeah, we're not going to do this three times.
[117:44.01]Not doing that three times.
[117:46.79]Tables, ladders, and chairs match.
[117:48.81]1v3 handicap tag.
[117:50.31]Here we go.
[117:51.85]Dollhouse Jerma versus three shadow movers.
[117:56.27]Begin.
[117:58.03]Tag rules apply.
[118:01.28]Right off the bat.
[118:03.88]Immediate pin.
[118:09.61]So I have to be careful here because I have to slow down.
[118:14.97]Don't use all my strength.
[118:17.25]Don't miss kicks to the ground for no reason.
[118:22.47]These are the guys that I heard about that were walking around during the dollhouse and moving furniture.
[118:27.45]That's what I was told.
[118:29.55]What a weird experience that was.
[118:32.43]It's my revenge time.
[118:39.77]Don't just stand there.
[118:40.65]What are you, stupid?
[118:46.26]I got to go through three of them.
[118:52.46]And I got good stats, let me tell you.
[118:56.62]Choking Jerma, Dollhouse jermaOn the ropes.
[119:02.76]While one of the three, big right hand onto Jerma985, Dollhouse Jerma985, day one.
[119:09.21]Tagging in one of the other movers.
[119:11.41]Which I believe they move in unison.
[119:14.03]I don't know if they're a single unit.
[119:16.41]If they're a collective unit.
[119:18.23]They could be a hive mind.
[119:19.55]I don't know.
[119:19.99]This is sad.
[119:25.08]Why is it sad?
[119:27.52]I didn't lose yet.
[119:28.72]Don't say that.
[119:29.28]We haven't even got a ladder in the goddamn ring.
[119:35.88]Don't count me out just yet.
[119:40.04]Come on, I'm doing a look at me.
[119:40.96]I'm getting really excited.
[119:48.83]Oh, I just choked his neck.
[119:50.17]Okay.
[119:53.57]The ducky shirt is perfect.
[119:54.69]It really is.
[120:00.67]Don't get stuck on the ropes and crash the damn game.
[120:05.58]Where else do you choke people?
[120:06.78]Um, I don't know.
[120:09.08]You can choke them in the water.
[120:10.74]Don't win.
[120:14.12]Dude, you must have huge sweat marks right now.
[120:16.58]I do.
[120:17.19]And you should have seen the sweat marks of the dollhouse.
[120:19.87]I'm glad I get to change clothes.
[120:21.07]Now dollhouse Jerma going into the corner.
[120:24.51]Does the gentle drop that... I'm talking into my wine glass right now.
[120:39.91]Did you try deodorant?
[120:41.87]I did.
[120:43.95]Look, there's a huge difference between sitting around with a blaring ring light and like a hot ass room and like you're wicked excited for like the rumble and the look at me, by the way, look at me taking fucking names here.
[121:04.87]I am taking names here.
[121:05.85]Or at least I was until you said something.
[121:12.47]You probably have high blood sugar?
[121:14.19]No, I- Alright.
[121:16.81]I don't- I don't need any medical Andes to tell me, like, what's wrong with me.
[121:21.86]I'm fine.
[121:29.64]Yeah, let me- let me- let me go get, like, a blood glucose monitor and, like, prick my finger.
[121:35.12]Balls count anywhere!
[121:36.04]I almost just won.
[121:45.39]What?
[121:56.38]My glue close, my glue, whatever, Glen close, what am I saying?
[122:09.65]You know what I'm saying.
[122:11.86]Big DDT on Dollhouse Jerma.
[122:15.63]If I get pinned, I'm gonna be pissed.
[122:17.73]Don't lose right now.
[122:18.99]Are you fucking kidding me?
[122:20.93]What a shitty match.
[122:22.59]That was awful.
[122:32.58]That was terrible.
[122:41.58]What was this move supposed to be?
[122:43.38]What?
[122:47.86]Maybe if I grab him by his waist and hold him down on top of me, how am I not being pinned?
[122:54.96]Was he pinning me?
[122:56.58]What a terrible move.
[122:59.68]It was awful.
[123:04.04]The Shadow Movers are your winner.
[123:05.50]We're not doing a rematch because that match was terrible.
[123:09.34]They didn't even get any ladders, any chairs, or any tables.
[123:12.86]It was supposed to be a furniture match.
[123:15.32]They did not care to take any of the furniture from under the ring.
[123:19.36]I just lost in five minutes.
[123:21.73]Okay.
[123:23.73]On to the next one.
[123:32.59]Oh, this is going to be good.
[123:36.58]This one's going to be good.
[123:40.30]You got bodied?
[123:42.24]It's a 3v1, man.
[123:43.26]I was going to get my ass kicked no matter what.
[123:44.60]Unless I could get a table or something.
[123:51.69]Alright, let's go.
[123:55.29]Willem Dafoe?
[123:59.01]Yeah.
[124:03.41]I almost spelt that all over me.
[124:08.16]Alright, the next one coming up is a Falls Count Anywhere 4 Fatal 4-Way.
[124:13.92]L ratio, give me your keys.
[124:15.34]I'm not going- What are you talking about?
[124:18.24]I'm gonna- My ass is gonna be planted in this seat for the next, like, three hours.
[124:23.08]I ain't going anywhere.
[124:23.84]Alright, here we go!
[124:35.65]The next match is a Fatal 4-Way.
[124:38.56]And I would call this one the gamer match.
[124:41.78]Doesn't mean... Here comes Pac-Man 99.
[124:43.14]Pac-Man 99.
[124:43.82]From the fifth dimension.
[124:46.26]P... What?
[124:47.14]P-A-C, man?
[125:09.27]Hackman 99.
[125:10.35]He's your first contestant.
[125:17.47]This is the gamer battle, like I told you.
[125:20.74]Fatal 4-Way.
[125:21.44]Let me copyright.
[125:25.02]Oh, please.
[125:29.06]Copyright.
[125:40.97]Our second contestant in this is, of course, who could forget?
[125:45.13]Cosmic Calamity from Monster Rancher 2.
[125:48.23]Now, I don't know how well this is going to play out.
[125:55.94]Because block wrestlers can crash the game.
[126:00.38]And they can fuck up the whole game.
[126:02.04]So, if the game crashes, that's a huge problem.
[126:07.45]That is Jerma's... Why am I speaking in third person?
[126:10.98]mine that is my Monster Rancher 2 character third person what the was that oh that's uh Jerm is uh the out of your mind that is cosmic calamity don't cr don't stop chanting crash I don't want the game to crash don't say that
[126:40.17]Captain Olimar.
[126:40.89]From the Wii.
[126:44.98]I don't know what he's holding.
[126:46.24]What is that?
[126:46.76]Is that Pikmin in that sack?
[126:55.11]What's in the sack?
[126:58.71]That's kind of fucked up.
[127:02.09]That's a great Olimar, by the way.
[127:13.00]It's the Pikmin!
[127:15.29]Don't swing it around, what are you doing?
[127:16.99]Uh, if you missed my Pikmin playthrough, I thought, um, the Wii sucks and I thought the game sucks.
[127:25.81]I hate the Wii and I hate Pikmin.
[127:29.14]Our next contestant... Is Anubis from Smite!
[127:43.27]From Cairo, Egypt, weighing in at 220 pounds.
[127:48.21]My favorite Smite character.
[127:53.16]A Noah Bass?
[127:57.90]Okay, I didn't know that.
[128:00.14]I didn't know that it was a Noah Bass.
[128:09.02]So we have Anubis, Pac-Man 99, Olimar, and Cosmic Calamity in a four-way... Alright.
[128:19.45]I think it's Extreme Rules, too.
[128:21.69]We'll find out in a second.
[128:25.01]I got my money on Cosmic Calamity.
[128:27.35]Or Anubis, because I love Smite.
[128:29.44]Everybody else hates it.
[128:31.34]It was nominated for Worst Stream of the Year, by the way.
[128:35.86]Four-way...
[128:37.18]Don't pin immediately.
[128:38.20]I actually kind of hope it happens.
[128:40.24]So Anubis and Cosmic Calamity now.
[128:48.19]In the corner.
[128:50.03]Already some drama.
[128:52.65]Prediction.
[128:53.01]I don't think we can do prediction.
[128:55.52]Crash.
[128:55.98]Don't stop.
[128:56.66]I don't want the game to crash.
[128:57.64]Stop saying that.
[128:59.37]The Rumble is... Okay, let me tell you something about the Rumble.
[129:03.45]The Rumble this year is like 22 characters that you are not going to see.
[129:08.23]None of these fucking idiots are in the Rumble.
[129:10.89]Let me make that really clear.
[129:13.03]None of these dickheads are in the Rumble.
[129:16.19]There were just so many characters this year.
[129:17.83]Oh, falls count anywhere.
[129:31.72]Who just hit their head?
[129:36.06]I don't- Please, I don't want the game to crash, God.
[129:41.53]Bunch of idiots.
[129:50.46]And Cosmic- Cosmic- I can't.
[129:54.44]Somebody said, where's the Among Us match?
[129:59.72]You'll never see one on this channel.
[130:01.26]Never.
[130:05.36]So in the corner, Cosmic Calamity in Olimar.
[130:09.34]Let's just throw somebody into the stairs 10 times in a row.
[130:12.10]That's great.
[130:13.78]Yeah, go ahead.
[130:14.42]Okay, throw into the stairs again.
[130:17.30]Does anybody else want to throw somebody in the stairs?
[130:21.38]Throw them into the stairs again.
[130:25.79]Will they do anything else?
[130:29.59]Do something besides throw into stairs.
[130:33.27]Oh my God.
[130:44.89]I got an idea.
[130:45.75]I'll throw them into the stairs.
[130:48.01]And then I'll try to pin them.
[130:49.59]That'll work.
[130:52.63]Hey, you guys want them over there?
[130:54.79]I'll throw them over there.
[130:55.39]There's no stairs over there, but I'll throw them that way.
[130:57.49]And then I'll do a fucking Fortnite dance.
[131:01.34]Idea.
[131:04.38]Leave me alone.
[131:10.42]I got an idea.
[131:11.34]Hey, I got an idea.
[131:14.62]How about Olimar grabs him by the neck and fucking twists him?
[131:20.96]Alright, back in the ring.
[131:22.48]Olimar now throwing Calamity.
[131:26.06]No, reversal on the ropes.
[131:27.54]Interesting.
[131:29.24]Put him into the turtling.
[131:31.90]I have no idea who... I think there's extreme rules on this too.
[131:36.80]Big DDT by Cosmic Calamity.
[131:39.84]While Lanubus and Pac-Man 99 are in the corner.
[131:45.44]Pushing his foot into his neck.
[131:48.32]Or whatever that is.
[131:49.00]I don't know if it has a face.
[131:54.38]How come Cosmic's not one-shotting everybody?
[131:57.28]Well, Cosmic Calamity has, I believe, like a hundred strength and zero everything else.
[132:04.88]I think.
[132:07.64]So, it's there.
[132:15.15]Going for the pin already.
[132:19.65]Threatening.
[132:23.89]Anubis Smite, by the way, voted for one of the worst streams of the year.
[132:28.55]It is nominated for one of the worst streams of the whole year.
[132:32.67]We'll find out what that is later on tonight.
[132:35.77]Big pin covering by Anubis.
[132:37.57]No, huge suplex off the top.
[132:39.19]Turnbuckle by Oluar onto Cosmic Calamity.
[132:44.26]Are we going to see a victory already?
[132:46.25]No way.
[132:46.99]Anubis breaks that up.
[132:51.79]We've not seen a weapon.
[132:53.53]We've not seen any attacks of chairs, sledgehammers.
[133:01.17]He just repeated himself three times.
[133:02.88]He's drunk.
[133:10.04]That was a tombstone, but I'm... I'm gonna start saying different... I think Anubis just won.
[133:20.53]I think Anubis almost just won right there.
[133:25.91]Anub... You guys are fucking with me.
[133:29.99]Okay, I gotta relax.
[133:33.11]You're being too funny.
[133:38.31]No, alright roll everybody relax What is happening big splash I
[134:07.97]No, only a two count.
[134:10.29]I'm not high.
[134:11.31]Just give me a second so I can reconvene my brain.
[134:16.33]What the fuck did he just do that for?
[134:20.70]Why did he do that?
[134:29.89]A big right hand by Anubis.
[134:33.53]Into a leg drop here.
[134:38.29]Now remember, balls count anywhere.
[134:45.45]You guys are making me laugh.
[134:46.53]I gotta fucking... I gotta take... I gotta hit the brakes.
[134:56.76]I just got her.
[134:57.24]What'd I miss?
[134:58.64]A lot of categories.
[134:59.40]A lot of fun stuff.
[135:02.96]Why?
[135:03.26]The referee is down.
[135:08.26]Watch the referee.
[135:08.98]Don't be an idiot.
[135:09.56]Don't hit the referee.
[135:10.30]Are you stupid?
[135:14.08]Alright.
[135:14.32]Somebody go through that table.
[135:16.16]I want someone to go through that table.
[135:19.18]Look at how nice they look.
[135:20.12]They got the Jerma985 branded logo.
[135:21.90]Get them through the table for God's sakes.
[135:29.71]Anubis with cosmic calamity into the stairs again.
[135:33.05]What else is new?
[135:40.01]The referee's like, oh, shit, I have to work.
[135:44.41]Your stream is lagging?
[135:45.41]I don't know why.
[135:45.89]That shouldn't be happening.
[135:49.11]Alright, get back in the ring.
[135:50.33]Let's go back to zero.
[135:52.77]I'm fine.
[135:53.31]I'm having a great fucking time.
[135:54.91]This is so much fun.
[135:57.23]Hope you're having a good time, too.
[135:59.69]Anubis outside with Cosmic Calamity.
[136:02.13]That's not even the right person.
[136:03.43]Oh, my God, Jeremy.
[136:04.93]Fucking give me a break.
[136:07.38]Olimar and Cosmic Calamity in the front of the ring.
[136:10.32]Inside the middle.
[136:11.70]As Calamity gets caught.
[136:17.22]I'm not muted.
[136:17.92]Shut up.
[136:21.62]Olimar is waiting for... Oh!
[136:24.02]That's a stunner!
[136:25.12]He got him with a stunner.
[136:26.18]That's a stunner.
[136:28.23]Hackman99 is completely clueless, but finally got over there.
[136:31.51]That was a stunner.
[136:34.15]That's his finishing move.
[136:37.61]Game's not muted, leave me alone.
[136:42.17]Big spin!
[136:46.27]You're doing your best.
[136:58.58]I'm supr- Why has nobody been pinned?
[137:03.38]I did not think this was gonna go this long as Anubis and Cosmic Calamity.
[137:10.83]Alright.
[137:11.45]Get him on the top rope.
[137:13.34]Suplex on the top rope.
[137:14.50]Let's see it, Anubis.
[137:15.74]Nope.
[137:18.92]I'm not stupid.
[137:19.88]I can see the OBS meters going up.
[137:21.40]I'm not dumb.
[137:23.60]Big Hurricane Runner reverse.
[137:25.14]No.
[137:25.56]Back.
[137:25.88]Belly to back.
[137:26.34]Suplex off the top rope.
[137:27.72]Anubis to Cosmic Calamity.
[137:30.16]That's huge.
[137:31.68]He may as well have just done his ult.
[137:35.09]Anubis just ulted Cosmic Calamity.
[137:36.97]Can he... Why don't... Just keep him on the ground, you idiot.
[137:40.71]What a fucking idiot.
[137:44.67]What a dumbass.
[137:50.76]Why would you not pin him?
[137:53.06]I'm not muted!
[137:54.08]Stop minus twoing!
[137:55.02]What's wrong with you guys?
[137:56.02]Leave me alone!
[138:00.34]Who is being pinned?
[138:02.00]You can't even see that from here.
[138:07.86]That referee could not even see the pin he was counting.
[138:16.77]What's happening?
[138:20.27]He can't even see.
[138:27.49]As Olimar grabs Pac-Man 99.
[138:30.56]Going up onto the top here, onto his shoulders.
[138:34.54]That's huge.
[138:37.28]Olimar could take it away right now.
[138:38.71]Olimar, take it away right now.
[138:41.31]Go for a pin.
[138:42.19]End it.
[138:43.55]Stop throwing people into... Oh, my God.
[138:49.09]Pin.
[138:49.55]Somebody pin.
[138:54.25]Big suplex.
[138:55.13]No.
[138:55.41]What was that?
[138:57.35]That's it.
[138:58.15]But who wins?
[138:59.91]I don't know.
[139:00.35]What?
[139:12.48]He's been pinning for way longer.
[139:14.98]It was over.
[139:16.00]Olimar wins.
[139:17.26]Olimar wins.
[139:18.36]What the fuck was that?
[139:26.71]He started counting for the guys on the left and didn't do Olimar's pin.
[139:30.49]What?
[139:32.42]The ref is drunk too?
[139:34.72]Alright, hide the champagne bottles from the rest of them, all of us.
[139:42.42]I can't believe Olimar didn't win.
[139:45.62]The ref is shit-faced.
[139:53.58]Another stunner.
[139:54.50]Alright, Olimar win the game right now.
[139:56.60]Oh my God.
[140:00.75]Everybody's shit-faced.
[140:03.93]They were taking shots of fireball backstage and that's always a bad idea.
[140:09.52]Don't ever let anyone convince you that's a good idea.
[140:13.66]Hey man, you want to take shots of fireball?
[140:18.10]No is always the answer.
[140:21.20]No is always the answer.
[140:24.41]Always.
[140:33.00]There's a two count.
[140:34.36]That's it.
[140:35.80]Cosmic Calamity.
[140:40.88]I don't know why they didn't count the Olimar outside.
[140:44.00]That was horseshit.
[140:46.38]Cosmic Calamity is your winner of the four-person gamer battle.
[140:51.19]That was rigged.
[140:52.03]I'll be honest.
[140:52.53]That was fucked up.
[140:54.87]There is no reason why Olimar should not have won.
[140:59.49]I agree with you.
[141:02.16]It's really messed up.
[141:03.88]Not cool.
[141:08.60]I love Cosmic Calamity.
[141:09.94]They're a great character, but I don't think they should have won.
[141:15.47]Not a chance.
[141:20.13]You did not have to be in the ring.
[141:21.29]You just had to pin somebody somewhere.
[141:29.41]And that is that one.
[141:31.99]We only have a few more matches left till the Rumble.
[141:34.65]We have a lot of categories to get through.
[141:39.46]So we'll go back to the categories.
[141:47.70]I didn't rig it, I swear to God.
[141:51.72]Okay.
[141:54.59]P-Break?
[141:55.03]Alright.
[141:56.07]We'll take one P-Break here.
[141:57.69]Go P. Go P.
[142:00.39]Go put some water in your face, you know, go take a second.
[142:02.99]We'll be right back.
[142:23.20]He's plastered.
[142:25.26]I'm really not, though.
[142:26.42]I'm just having a good time.
[142:29.13]It's been a fucking blast.
[142:30.31]I'm happy to share it with all of you.
[142:32.60]I'll be right back.
[142:35.68]I'm alright.
[142:36.18]I'm a little... I'm alright.
[142:37.89]Don't worry about me.
[142:41.29]I'll be right back.
[144:12.48]you
[146:17.50]Thank you.
[147:33.87]Okay.
[147:35.57]Hello.
[147:36.19]How are you?
[147:36.81]Welcome back.
[147:38.75]We have more categories to go through.
[147:40.41]Uh, quite a few more.
[147:44.09]So let's get them done.
[147:45.03]Let me make sure this is in the right spot.
[147:52.02]It is.
[147:52.38]Okay, cool.
[147:58.70]Looks good.
[147:59.38]Okay.
[148:04.69]Not much longer until we have to get rid of the Christmas BRB screen.
[148:07.73]How was my poop?
[148:08.51]It was awesome.
[148:10.83]No, we're good.
[148:12.49]Okay.
[148:13.25]Hi.
[148:13.83]How are you?
[148:16.48]Coming up next, this is the meaty categories.
[148:19.98]No.
[148:22.06]Oh, yeah.
[148:23.42]These are meaty.
[148:25.96]We're going to start with the best joke.
[148:30.20]Taking more than five minutes to set up.
[148:34.44]Seven minutes?
[148:34.98]Seven minutes for what?
[148:38.02]Oh shit!
[148:38.68]Yeah, you're right.
[148:39.52]Central time.
[148:40.10]That's right.
[148:42.82]Alright, so, uh, every year there's a lot of jokes that I do.
[148:47.06]A lot of things that I think are funny, that I hope are funny.
[148:50.27]But, uh, sometimes they're good, sometimes they're bad.
[148:53.43]So this is what people have nominated for the best jokes of the year.
[148:58.51]Best jokes of the year.
[149:00.57]So we're getting into a big category here.
[149:02.09]This is a huge category.
[149:04.57]So here are your nominees for best joke of the year, taking more than five minutes to set up.
[149:12.63]Was there blood in my stool?
[149:33.39]Griffin family.
[149:34.58]Stewie, it's time for school.
[149:37.21]I should not have to go to school.
[149:38.87]We got this new friend, Jerma985.
[149:41.61]He's here hanging out with us.
[149:43.85]I will make my secret Pawtucket Pete beer cheese pretzels.
[149:55.96]Give me that.
[149:57.74]Come on, 71 million a sprint.
[150:00.95]And that's a coin.
[150:02.43]Oh, that's
[150:10.37]That's 3.1 million limes.
[150:12.78]Hey, get yourself some.
[150:19.52]Nice.
[150:20.48]This is why he's green.
[150:24.00]Only funny voices.
[150:25.08]Wait.
[150:27.34]Only funny voices for 20 straight minutes?
[150:31.66]I don't know if I can do that.
[150:33.34]It's very difficult to do this and still play the video game at the same time.
[150:38.26]I'll tell you, it's not easy.
[150:40.14]This is Bernie.
[150:41.18]This is Bernie.
[150:42.44]If Bernie is morphing into a bunch of things, Bernie is morphing into Jerma guy again.
[150:49.75]Not a slip.
[150:50.59]This is non-slip.
[150:52.69]This is rock and bubble.
[150:55.89]That's not a slip.
[150:57.74]That sounds sort of like the way that I kind of talk a little.
[151:01.72]But now you make me go... Here we go.
[151:05.43]Did he grab her?
[151:09.85]Please eat her.
[151:10.63]Eat her, please.
[151:15.19]Wait, he's still in the cutscene.
[151:17.21]He's still in the cutscene.
[151:19.09]Wait, he's blocking...
[151:45.98]Okay, I'm gonna go for a bite.
[151:50.14]Oh my god.
[151:56.55]Oh my god.
[151:57.51]It's so good.
[151:59.07]Oh my god.
[152:00.82]Oh my god.
[152:07.52]Oh my god.
[152:10.26]It's so good.
[152:17.40]Guys, so I was at the store yesterday and I got a Dunkin Donuts large iced coffee.
[152:23.82]And, dude, I'm telling you, it was fucking gross.
[152:26.69]It was the grossest coffee I've ever had in my life.
[152:28.25]It was disgusting.
[152:32.05]Oh, hey, guys.
[152:32.91]Hey, you ever pick up the phone, and somebody, it's a wrong number, and you say, oh, hey, wrong number.
[152:39.91]Hey, screw you, buddy.
[152:41.67]You know what I mean?
[152:42.87]Like, that's a +2.
[152:43.87]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[152:52.84]We're not going to use this anywhere, right?
[152:57.54]Are you going to make sure nobody can hear me?
[153:04.31]Oh, go hit that follow button if you could.
[153:07.13]Aaron?
[153:07.47]Aaron!
[153:08.29]Aaron!
[153:09.37]Aaron!
[153:11.23]Oh shit, you're going to know who I am!
[153:13.99]No, what I meant to say was...
[153:18.95]No, you don't know who I am.
[153:21.87]I'm the secret streamer.
[153:23.25]I figured you out.
[153:23.91]I'm contacting the thieves.
[153:25.75]Oh, yeah.
[153:26.26]Look at you.
[153:27.36]Look at me.
[153:28.02]Look at you.
[153:28.26]You think you know who this is?
[153:30.64]What an idiot.
[153:32.12]What an idiot.
[153:33.36]You guys want to fuck with new viewers?
[153:34.60]Okay, so I'm going to get a royalty-free song that's, like, with a lot of drums.
[153:39.52]I'm going to full cam and just be, like, fucking, like, playing, like, air drums and, like, be wicked into it and shit.
[153:53.30]I can't!
[153:53.89]I can't!
[153:54.69]I can't do it!

[155:40.75]You'll get up here eventually.
[155:41.75]I know you will.
[155:45.70]He's picking the tables up.
[155:47.72]Come on up here.
[155:48.28]This is it.
[155:59.45]It's in this area here.
[156:04.61]I'm going to find that goddamn treasure, and I'll be the first one to set up.
[156:10.75]I want to go backwards.
[156:12.25]Oh, I can't believe it.
[156:13.13]Jeremiah, how do you know how to use that?
[156:14.47]But you don't think I fucking know everything?
[156:16.69]You don't think I know how to use one of these?
[156:18.59]I worked for 10 years in the industry.
[156:20.55]Give me a break.
[156:31.59]Okay.
[156:33.29]So, this one is pretty interesting because, uh, Happy New Year Central- Oh, hold on!
[156:41.11]And all acquaintance be for God and I. Oh, ooh, ee, oh!
[156:54.20]Uh, Happy New Year Central.
[156:57.26]The best joke taking more than five minutes to set up.
[157:01.00]Which is, this is actually really surprising.
[157:04.06]I am shocked by this one.
[157:09.32]The winner of the best joke taking more than five minutes.
[157:12.80]This is a shocker.
[157:14.28]I think a lot of people will give this an upset.
[157:18.48]It's an upset.
[157:20.12]What?
[157:21.62]Leave me alone.
[157:24.24]Bought a Whopper and ate it on stream with 19% of the vote.
[157:30.03]That's the winner.
[157:31.90]Drumming, Rock Out Break, and Grotto Beasts were pretty much tied.
[157:37.86]Buying a Whopper and eating it on stream, you guys thought was better than anything else of the whole year.
[157:46.45]I just ate a Whopper on camera.
[157:51.49]I ate Burger King on camera.
[157:53.45]I ate Burger King on camera.
[157:57.29]Uh, drumming was 12% in second place.
[158:00.23]That was a pretty good one.
[158:01.49]I thought that wasn't fun.
[158:03.09]That one was very fun.
[158:04.75]It was rigged.
[158:07.71]It was not rigged.
[158:10.95]So just like the best, let's go ahead and do the worst.
[158:15.31]These are the worst things I did the whole year.
[158:17.62]These are the worst jokes I've ever made in all of 2021.
[158:20.90]Not proud of these.
[158:23.82]I'm ashamed of these.
[158:26.74]Here are your nominees, just like the best, here are your nominees for the worst jokes of the year.
[158:32.26]That took more than five minutes to set up.
[158:35.88]Embarrassing.
[158:39.39]Here we go.
[158:48.07]And then we'll do... Hmm.
[158:51.67]Hmm.
[158:52.32]It's gonna be a cake.
[158:53.14]Yeah.
[158:54.04]Fuck the haters.
[158:55.18]Right?
[158:55.54]Fuck the haters.
[158:58.06]I'm putting marshmallows on my building.
[159:01.22]Fuck the haters.
[159:01.82]And they have to be different sizes too.
[159:03.64]Oh my god.
[159:04.24]This is so omega ooey gooey.
[159:07.42]Drippy.
[159:09.10]That doesn't look cheesy.
[159:10.17]Are people bored?
[159:12.74]Are you bored?
[159:13.50]Oh, well, I'm... Whatever.
[159:16.04]Look at this.
[159:16.52]I'm making a masterpiece.
[159:17.94]No, alright.
[159:18.66]I'm not messing with it anymore.
[159:19.78]I'm not messing with it anymore.
[159:21.19]It's over.
[159:22.69]I did it.
[159:23.49]There it is.
[159:23.93]The Gronk's Ice Cream City Hall.
[159:25.29]I don't know why.
[159:26.19]I want to, like, make two cams.
[159:28.89]Have one of them be blue and the other one be red.
[159:31.47]And put them right next to each other transparent.
[159:33.55]And, like, give you, like, a 3D show.
[159:35.49]I'm coming at you.
[159:36.75]I'm coming at you.
[159:50.60]Okay, I'm gonna go for a bite.
[159:57.96]Oh my god.
[160:01.18]Oh my god.
[160:01.60]Why is this here?
[160:03.32]You can't have best and worst joke of the year.
[160:06.28]It's so stupid.
[160:12.15]Oh my god.
[160:14.89]It's so good.
[160:21.96]You guys want to fuck with new viewers?
[160:23.50]Okay, so I'm going to get a royalty-free song that's, like, with a lot of drums.
[160:28.12]I'm going to full camp.
[160:29.58]Also on best of the year.
[160:30.80]Just be, like, fucking, like, playing, like, air drums and, like, be wicked into it and shit.
[160:38.13]Look at how split of a community we really have.
[160:42.90]People hated this, but they loved it on the other side, right?
[160:46.47]It's so funny.
[160:56.92]Okay, I will do a welcome to JermaCraft as the entire Griffin family.
[161:01.74]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[161:02.92]Welcome to episode one of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[161:07.25]This is going to be a single-player Let's Play, and I say, when I say Let's Play, I use that term pretty loosely, because I am a stupid idiot dumbass in this game.
[161:15.91]You're going to see lots of you.
[161:17.01]That's a fake one.
[161:18.01]Alright, I'm starting to see ResidentSleepers.
[161:19.53]I gotta go.
[161:20.15]I have to get this done right now.
[161:21.50]I don't care.
[161:21.90]It's a billion off the dead.
[161:22.76]I don't give a shit how it sounds.
[161:25.28]Uh-oh.
[161:26.95]I'm seeing the rest of the sleepers.
[161:27.83]I gotta go.
[161:29.29]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[161:30.53]Welcome to episode one of JermaCraft.
[161:32.39]It's fucking Jesus Christ.
[161:36.67]One, two, three.
[161:44.41]What's in there?
[161:46.39]I'm not sure.
[161:47.47]What?
[161:51.92]Oh my god!
[161:53.19]It's Minecraft Diamond!
[161:56.62]This is like...
[161:59.02]This is like what I see when I look down in the bathtub, okay?
[162:02.56]Like, you know what I mean?
[162:03.10]It's just like, oh, there it is.
[162:04.13]A deformed penis?
[162:06.63]That's not a... This is like what your dick does when you just are sitting around hanging out in your living room, okay?
[162:12.89]This is what it looks like.
[162:14.45]It's like pushed up against your pants.
[162:16.63]Alright, I'm done.
[162:17.67]If you sit in the bathtub, if you're lying in the bathtub and you are lying back and you look down, it's gonna look like this.
[162:26.04]I'm sorry, but I have to do this.
[162:28.96]It's like... What do you want me to say?
[162:37.71]That's TOS?
[162:39.05]That is a piece of frosting that I can't wait to... Never mind.
[162:44.47]Oh, shit!
[162:45.37]And then we'll do...
[163:00.49]Mm.
[163:01.03]It's gonna be a cake.
[163:02.77]Fuck the haters.
[163:03.89]Right?
[163:04.28]Fuck the haters.
[163:05.24]I didn't mean to click.
[163:06.72]I'm so sorry.
[163:07.10]I'm putting marshmallows on my building.
[163:08.26]Hold on.
[163:08.60]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[163:09.98]I'll fix it.
[163:10.42]I'll fix it.
[163:10.78]There have to be different sizes, too.
[163:12.16]Oh, my God.
[163:12.99]This is so omega ooey gooey.
[163:16.51]stripping.
[163:18.69]I didn't mean to click that.
[163:20.21]God damn it.
[163:20.97]Are you bored?
[163:22.53]Well, whatever.
[163:24.08]We're going to watch it again.
[163:25.50]I'm so pissed.
[163:26.94]It was one more.
[163:28.54]I'm not messing with it anymore.
[163:29.92]It's over.
[163:30.32]Wait, wait, wait.
[163:31.90]I got it.
[163:32.22]There it is.
[163:32.66]The Gronk's Ice Cream City Hall.
[163:37.67]We'll get there.
[163:38.17]Hold on.
[163:47.06]I can't- Son of a- God damn it.
[163:54.27]I didn't mean to- I swear to God, I didn't mean to do that.
[164:00.21]While that's on, we gotta get- we have to get to the last part.
[164:07.92]Just play it in VLC?
[164:09.30]No, I can't.
[164:11.26]It'll take two seconds, just relax.
[164:17.59]It's got five seconds, relax.
[164:24.98]I don't want, I'm not, I did not, I'm sorry.
[164:27.30]I promise, I did not mean to do that, I promise.
[164:28.96]You fucking idiot.
[164:31.64]I'll be on cam for a minute.
[164:46.76]Okay, it's in the background, that's fine.
[164:49.74]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[164:54.16]Sure.
[164:55.30]Minecraft.
[164:56.26]Series where I play it.
[164:57.98]Yep.
[165:00.15]I gotta go, ResidentSleepers.
[165:01.25]Yep.
[165:06.17]Yep.
[165:07.49]He's still going.
[165:08.25]Okay.
[165:15.87]We saw that one.
[165:16.45]Okay.
[165:21.55]Okay.
[165:21.81]Okay.
[165:24.45]Okay.
[165:28.85]The winner of the worst... I'll just tell you.
[165:31.40]Who cares?
[165:32.06]It was by a landslide.
[165:33.62]It was by a goddamn landslide.
[165:34.98]Who cares?
[165:35.30]Okay.
[165:45.41]Wait, stop, stop, slow down, slow down.
[165:49.64]Slow down!
[165:55.86]Why won't it slow down?
[165:58.79]Oh my god, you piece of crap.
[166:00.61]It won't slow down.
[166:18.93]And your winner of worst joke of the year, taking more than five minutes to set up.
[166:26.17]With 26% of the vote.
[166:30.45]Family Guy, JermaCraft, you all know it was going to win.
[166:34.29]And then bought a Whopper and ate it on stream.
[166:36.74]Which is, it's insane.
[166:40.14]It's insane.
[166:41.76]Because the Whopper, like, it was like 20% in both worst and best.
[166:47.68]That doesn't make any sense.
[166:50.85]And then the Archeology Minecraft Diamond at 14%.
[166:53.19]The Family Guy Jermacraft thing was a disaster.
[166:58.56]I'm embarrassed publicly.
[166:59.68]It was awful.
[167:02.70]Best accident?
[167:09.80]It was best and worst.
[167:10.86]But yeah, that just shows how completely disconnected everybody is here.
[167:16.57]Half of you thought it was the best.
[167:18.19]Half of you thought it was the worst.
[167:22.49]Let's do two more.
[167:24.55]Two more categories.
[167:27.43]This is so fucked.
[167:30.64]Okay.
[167:31.98]These two.
[167:34.12]Don't even look at the label of these two.
[167:36.62]There's no reason to look at the label.
[167:38.28]You don't have to look.
[167:40.34]It's the same damn category.
[167:41.78]It doesn't matter.
[167:43.22]There were 200, 200 nominees for best and worst noise of the year.
[167:53.09]most we've ever seen the most noise nominations ever by plus a hundred there were so many nominees I have to like reel it in in 2022. I'm gonna reel it in I'm gonna relax I'm gonna try to stop make it because I'm gonna I'm gonna try to be a normal human being in 2022.
[168:18.96]How much of a crazy person do you have to be to have your best noise category?
[168:23.42]I have a hundred and fucking twenty-five nominations.
[168:27.60]We had to drop it down to like twenty.
[168:30.14]And that's all, that's, that's still, that's too many.
[168:32.75]That's way too many.
[168:36.91]Here are your nominees for best noise of the year.
[168:42.21]That includes burps, sneezes, uh, like yells, pukes.
[168:50.42]Best noise of the year.
[168:51.13]Here we go.
[168:53.31]Aaron.
[168:58.69]Excuse me.
[169:09.66]I think all whipped cream is great.
[169:10.84]I don't know.
[169:11.22]What's the hate to whipped cream?
[169:12.94]Am I muted right now?
[169:16.56]Oh, hey.
[169:16.72]You were muted for a second.
[169:17.75]Sorry.
[169:18.09]What were you saying?
[169:18.61]Yeah.
[169:19.77]I was just saying that.
[169:21.99]Hijack the data.
[169:30.71]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[169:34.22]Come on!
[169:36.22]What are you trying to do, rip me off?
[169:42.28]I'm getting sucked into a wormhole!
[169:53.73]Do a funny sound effect.
[170:09.52]I'm gonna stealth kill the mortar guy.
[170:11.86]Oh my god!
[170:19.28]Alright, we're fine.
[170:19.97]Come out here.
[170:20.29]Can I get rid of the rabbit?
[170:22.49]Oh, what happened?
[170:23.57]No.
[170:28.08]I was trying.
[170:31.32]I can feel the dead air.
[170:36.26]Now watch, she's going to come try to like kiss me and I'm going to go and I'm going to push her away.
[170:43.91]Watch, I'm not going to do anything.
[170:45.79]That's the quickest way to get disinvited to anything else in the future.
[170:50.96]is being in that general chat with, like, 15 people and being like, hey, hey, so I picked the beaver.
[170:56.34]And, oh, that's kind of where the beaver goes.
[170:58.97]The beaver makes that sound.
[170:59.85]And then he goes, and then he gnaws on the corn.
[171:02.07]And then I put the horse in there, and they'd be like, alright, Jeremy, like, can you stop?
[171:07.09]Like, can you leave the call?
[171:08.17]Like, stop.
[171:08.63]We're trying to, like, set this up.
[171:10.37]Watch him go on the right side.
[171:12.53]Oh, no.
[171:13.13]No, he did it.
[171:14.23]He did the same exact arrows that he got hit with.
[171:18.03]Oh, la, la.
[171:19.33]Damn it.
[171:23.04]Why is that on here?
[171:23.68]No, we don't have enough room.
[171:26.46]He does this only for the power.
[171:30.14]He got her killed.
[171:55.41]Somebody came in here and like killed me and muted the microphone right by, ow.
[172:02.79]Oh, a burger.
[172:04.59]Can you talk while inhaling at the same time?
[172:07.55]I, nope.
[172:09.48]I don't think so.
[172:23.87]So, not to confuse you, that was best noise of the year.
[172:29.56]The winner of best noise of 2021 deranged with laughter, followed closely by Lala at 10%, deranged with 11%, and fill the dead air with 10%.
[172:54.55]These were so close.
[172:55.31]It was impossible to even just differentiate.
[172:59.54]Lala lost by like 0.8%.
[173:04.42]The deranged laughter won.
[173:07.28]And then fill the dead air right after.
[173:11.63]So pretend like you didn't hear the category.
[173:15.55]If you're like, oh, noise.
[173:17.17]Best noise.
[173:17.97]Yeah, it don't matter.
[173:21.01]Here's the worst noise of the year.
[173:24.83]I would put your volume down like 10 to 20%, I would say.
[173:28.83]Maybe 5%.
[173:29.59]Some of these are probably really annoying.
[173:34.73]Here are the nominees for the worst noise of the year.
[173:48.94]Alright, now you pissed me off.
[174:05.55]Wouldn't be the first time you abandoned the channel.
[174:12.36]Kill it!
[174:15.27]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[174:19.68]What's the video of the guy like on... Like a reality show?
[174:25.26]It's not about... I know where they come up.
[174:27.06]The problem is like... Like...
[174:39.22]There it is.
[174:40.16]I'm basing the opinion of bringing the fox up, not because I want to be the contrarian, but because of that video of the fox going like... That's such a cute video.
[174:52.49]I love it.
[175:10.08]It just keeps going.
[175:12.40]What's up, dog?
[175:23.18]You just made the lemur behind me laugh.
[175:25.88]I didn't die.
[175:27.44]I forgot to tell you guys.
[175:28.08]I got a lemur.
[175:39.65]oh here's every single uh mukbang video you've ever watched in your entire life what about people that were in the Jerma rumble
[176:00.04]Suck on these.
[176:06.74]Finally, I knew you would.
[176:10.40]Chris, here I go.
[176:12.04]I don't think I have the other stones.
[176:14.42]Yes.
[176:21.95]Yes, I'll get the stones.
[176:24.31]I'll go after those stones.
[176:26.85]Yes, of course, I'll get the stones.
[176:38.91]Hello, hello, hello.
[176:40.15]Hello, hello.
[176:41.57]Hello, hello.
[176:51.19]Jesus.
[176:51.99]Oh, my God.
[176:53.07]Go to the workshop at the back and buy the streaming function.
[176:58.10]Oof.
[176:59.18]Off.
[177:00.04]Off.
[177:00.74]Off.
[177:02.92]2020.
[177:03.00]That was last year.
[177:06.06]Wait.
[177:06.48]Let me take a guess.
[177:07.72]Is thrumming like this like...
[177:13.49]Is that what it might be?
[177:24.00]Okay.
[177:27.08]Your winner of this year's worst noise of the year.
[177:39.09]I've got it right here.
[177:44.08]oh wow this was close my god there was a 37 vote difference with 16.6 of the vote it's the Spamton request accepted the right after that was the cursed mukbang 16.6 and 16.3
[178:13.04]Very far away was Saucondesnuts.
[178:19.27]That was a 37 vote difference.
[178:22.05]By the way, something funny to note about the best and worst noise category, some of the most skipped.
[178:33.67]1,270 people skipped this question, which is a lot of people.
[178:44.68]Alright.
[178:46.12]Let's get back to the rumble.
[178:49.02]No, you know what?
[178:50.16]Fuck it.
[178:52.16]We got... Yeah, we'll do two more.
[178:56.44]Two more categories.
[178:58.68]Two more categories.
[179:01.74]Yeah, a bunch of... I mean, would you want to take that test?
[179:06.12]I don't want to listen to like 25 of this like annoying dudes, like annoying sounds.
[179:12.12]It makes perfect sense.
[179:14.37]right we will do two more because there's still oh my god there's like 12 more categories holy alright coming up next is a popular one very popular this is best one guy moment of the year if you don't know what a one guy moment is a one guy moment is when somebody in chat
[179:39.02]derails the stream to a point where we spend about 5 to 10 plus minutes potentially, even maybe less, maybe more, dealing with the fact that this person derailed the stream.
[179:50.93]It's the best chat kind of, I guess, chat message, chat derailment.
[179:57.71]It's the best one guy moment of the year.
[180:02.04]And there was a lot of great categories this year.
[180:04.12]Holy smokes.
[180:06.68]We'll see them right now.
[180:17.75]Wait, I don't have a Rubik's Cube
[180:41.15]Guys, I have no fucking idea how to do a Rubik's Cube.
[180:44.18]I have absolutely no idea.
[180:48.56]I've only picked him up and just mushed him around in my hands for two minutes.
[180:52.77]I don't even know how it works.
[180:54.69]I don't understand how it works.
[180:56.53]We're on times two speed.
[181:16.36]Did somebody say next game?
[181:30.19]Yeah, let me load up Yakuza.
[181:32.01]I'm just telling you that I finally ate In-N-Out the way that I was told.
[181:36.19]I was supposed to quote order special the burger.
[181:39.77]And it was better than just ordering it off the menu.
[181:44.40]Which makes me want to put it down here.
[181:48.68]EVEN ANIMAL-STYLE DICK!
[181:51.80]Remember, please apologize for timing me out for 10 minutes.
[181:54.14]Alright, so the pre-stream chat, I timed somebody out for 10 minutes, but hold on.
[181:58.26]Yes, I apologize for timing you out for 10 minutes in pre-stream, but let's talk about the context first.
[182:03.08]You asked me to play Destiny 2 PvP tomorrow.
[182:06.94]Do you think that- is that a- should I have timed you out for an hour?
[182:09.92]My little sister's afraid of you.
[182:13.62]Why- why is your little sister watching this stream?
[182:16.44]Does your little sister hate me now?
[182:19.77]I've got somebody here.
[182:22.46]Come on over here.
[182:27.36]Hello.
[182:28.00]It's me, Elmo.
[182:29.52]Hey, Elmo.
[182:30.38]What are you doing here?
[182:32.30]Well, I want to teach everybody some sharing and how to share your milk.
[182:37.63]She's 24?
[182:44.37]I pressed the button accident.
[182:46.39]She's 24?
[182:46.67]She really does look like a GTA mod.
[182:55.34]The Flying Dutchman sucks.
[182:57.82]It still makes me laugh.
[182:58.92]The Flying Dutchman sucks so bad.
[183:04.16]GTA mod.
[183:05.54]I can't get over it.
[183:06.32]Okay, perfect game.
[183:07.30]Come on.
[183:08.42]Can you please designate a corner of the screen for bird watching videos?
[183:11.22]Well, this is it.
[183:16.02]The fucking bird video is distracting me.
[183:18.18]I keep looking at it.
[183:20.62]I keep looking over here at these birds.
[183:22.38]Hey!
[183:22.54]Get out of there.
[183:23.92]That's not yours.
[183:24.56]That's not for you.
[183:26.62]Stop eating the bird's bird seed.
[183:31.44]I'm more interested.
[183:34.04]Wait, I'm... He's like, hey, get out of here.
[183:39.60]This is our bird seed.
[183:41.20]My absolute favorite part of Harry Potter was Voldemort's strange sounds he would make.
[183:54.11]Why did somebody make a compilation?
[183:58.93]It's... It's Homer Simpson.
[184:03.56]It's not Homer Simpson.
[184:11.00]Jerma, I would... Jerma, I would rather see you in the hospital than on TikTok.
[184:21.04]That's so fucked up.
[184:23.26]Holy shit, dude.
[184:24.46]What the fuck?
[184:25.40]I'm just gonna read this.
[184:27.00]At a dream last night, Jerma became like a mainstream celebrity by pioneering a new type of stream where he would play a game like normal, but every once in a while he would let chat peep the horror and put this like red and black pulsating mass on screen.
[184:45.25]It kinda looked like an AI-generated image.
[184:47.91]And the whole deal was that everyone who saw it thought it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen, but every time he'd show it, one viewer who saw it would die.
[184:58.94]It ended when he showed it on stream and dropped dead.
[185:02.34]The stream was left on for 72 hours to honor his memory.
[185:09.03]It was dead quiet with just his body and a slowly pulsating red mask on screen beside him.
[185:19.14]Stop pretending to be interested.
[185:21.02]You're not going to play any of these games.
[185:23.58]You'll be too busy playing like Fart Simulator 2013.
[185:26.26]I got to hide.
[185:27.90]I got to get out and hide.
[185:29.84]I'm on the ground.
[185:31.94]Is this the Union?
[185:39.85]We've unionized!
[185:41.85]Cigarette?
[185:43.63]It's just a used, a done cigarette.
[185:53.36]No, that's a banana.
[185:55.48]That's a banana.
[185:56.52]Relax.
[186:00.78]When it gets to this face, however, the TV froze.
[186:05.15]So I tried turning it on and off to restart it, but the TV just won't turn off, and it's stuck on this fucked up image of Jerma's face.
[186:13.69]Okay, I don't know how that happened.
[186:17.05]A couple hours pass, and I don't know why it took me a while, but I finally decide to unplug the TV.
[186:23.57]And then I realize that the face is permanently burned onto the screen.
[186:28.13]Like it's just stuck there.
[186:30.14]My parents aren't back until later in the night.
[186:32.62]So now I'm freaking out trying to cover the screen.
[186:36.36]So that they don't see the stupid face burned onto their thousand dollar TV.
[186:40.86]What do I do?
[186:51.79]If only it was real.
[186:56.07]Ladies and gentlemen.
[186:58.65]The winner.
[187:00.82]Of the best one guy moment of the year.
[187:04.98]Oh, there are a lot of good ones too.
[187:07.68]There were a lot of good ones.
[187:18.19]Oh!
[187:18.47]With 27% of the vote.
[187:23.47]Keep the horror.
[187:25.99]Keep the horror is your winner at 27%.
[187:29.45]Jigsaw's Rubik's Cube at 17.6%, and then right below it is the Weird Face Burnin' at 17.3%.
[187:42.41]There was a 45 vote difference between two and three.
[187:48.90]They're all winners to me.
[187:52.34]These are all winners to me.
[187:57.20]The Rubik's Cube, that was some of the funniest shit I've ever seen in my life.
[188:01.06]The Burnin' shit was some of the funniest shit.
[188:03.70]I will tell you right now, I know that like people say this about their communities.
[188:07.61]They say this, oh man, my community is like so funny.
[188:11.37]Some of you guys just come up with some of the most fucked up funny shit I've ever heard of.
[188:16.52]And it is an honor to be able to see it and laugh at it.
[188:20.82]So let me just be clear about that.
[188:24.17]Uh, we will do the rest of these in a little bit.
[188:26.67]We'll go back to the, uh, Rumble.
[188:29.66]There are a few more matches to do.
[188:31.04]Hopefully it doesn't crash.
[188:34.76]Hopefully you can hear it.
[188:37.30]Yeah, like it's so hard to pick between what the community jokes that you guys make.
[188:43.80]It's genuinely funny shit.
[188:49.21]Uh, let's do a couple more matches in the Rumble.
[188:52.40]Well, not the rumble.
[188:52.96]The rumble's not till later.
[188:53.90]We're not there yet.
[188:56.46]Let us peep the horror.
[188:57.28]Peep the horror wins.
[188:59.30]That's just such an insane concept to me.
[189:02.47]Like, what a wild thing to come up with.
[189:09.03]Is this going to be a seven-hour stream?
[189:12.01]We'll definitely do the Pacific countdown.
[189:16.44]But I don't know how much longer after that.
[189:19.62]I'm having a great time.
[189:20.52]This is a fucking blast.
[189:22.91]Hopefully you're having fun too.
[189:25.43]Let us continue with the rumble.
[189:29.36]We have, I think, three more matches to do in the Jermania card.
[189:35.92]Oh god, fuck this match.
[189:38.66]Okay, this is a ladder match.
[189:40.80]This is a six-man ladder match.
[189:47.70]This could go on for a very long time.
[189:49.56]I hope it does not last that long.
[189:55.64]Tell me I'm funny now.
[189:56.60]You're probably funny.
[189:57.84]I don't know.
[190:02.93]Is it mountain time in 30 minutes?
[190:04.30]Yeah.
[190:04.52]25 minutes, 30 minutes.
[190:10.83]There were so many characters.
[190:12.09]I had to just... We had to do so many matches because you can only do 30 people in a Rumble.
[190:18.87]So... Almost all of the people in the Rumble are people that are not... You haven't seen yet.
[190:25.92]So I was like, damn, we have like fucking 60 characters.
[190:29.10]We have to put them in somewhere.
[190:32.40]And this is where we put them in.
[190:35.33]So without further ado, we got another match here.
[190:37.03]We got a ladder match.
[190:38.11]Six-man ladder match.
[190:43.34]Here we go.
[190:48.01]There were so many characters.
[190:55.07]This is a ladder match, which means you have to climb to the top of the ladder.
[190:59.39]Grab the money in the bank.
[191:02.31]And this is between Rathu Flush.
[191:07.42]Of course, from the Flush family.
[191:10.38]The Sims family.
[191:13.22]There's Rathuflush.
[191:15.20]Quite a few flushes.
[191:29.45]Nice bug eyes, yeah.
[191:34.55]There's Rathuflush.
[191:39.31]Who could possibly come in next?
[191:45.80]I wonder if it's anybody else in the Flush family.
[191:49.40]It could be the entire Flush family.
[191:53.30]Could be.
[191:54.40]Of course, that's Grunty Flush.
[191:59.28]Where did he just go?
[192:05.10]Never give up.
[192:07.02]Okay.
[192:08.56]Thanks, Grunty.
[192:11.12]That's good advice.
[192:17.59]Don't ever give up.
[192:25.61]Grunty Flush.
[192:26.81]Wrathu Flush.
[192:32.24]You probably see where this is going.
[192:40.94]There's Ratchet Flush.
[192:45.16]What?
[192:57.87]Yeah, they're all 220 pounds.
[193:02.62]It's to make sure nobody has an advantage in the actual matches.
[193:07.24]Some are actually, they weigh a lot less.
[193:15.40]Any other Flush family members we should be aware of?
[193:17.56]Oh my god!
[193:23.64]That's strong Henry Flush!
[193:25.14]He was voted nominated!
[193:27.73]Top character of the year!
[193:29.01]I hope he dies in this match.
[193:38.94]I hope somebody breaks his neck in this match.
[193:51.44]Fuck this guy.
[193:51.94]Let's go.
[194:06.99]Who could forget Bumpy Flush?
[194:09.79]The cat.
[194:11.71]I just burped so loud.
[194:15.41]This is the character I dropped the meteor on.
[194:19.00]I dropped a meteor on Bumpy Flush accidentally, not on purpose, accidentally.
[194:36.17]And finally.
[194:36.79]Who could forget Sus Flush?
[194:43.69]Or the Sus Guy, either one, who cares?
[194:47.65]It doesn't matter.
[194:48.31]I hope this does not go 40 goddamn minutes.
[195:02.48]I'm hoping this is over in 10 minutes.
[195:04.84]That would be ideal.
[195:05.64]That'd be great.
[195:14.79]Here we go, the six-man ladder match between the Sus family.
[195:18.29]That's not them.
[195:20.66]It's the Flush family.
[195:24.20]Sus Flush, Grunty Flush, Ratchet Flush, Rathu Flush, Strong Henry Flush, Bumpy Flush.
[195:30.08]Here they go.
[195:33.21]The only way you can win this match if you climb to the top of the ladder, grab that money in the bag briefcase.
[195:40.69]The Sus Dynasty.
[195:44.68]Already we have a few problems.
[195:46.64]Sus Flush going up to Strong Henry.
[195:49.66]Gets double drop kicked for his trouble.
[195:54.72]No, you can't predict all four.
[195:56.42]No, you can't.
[196:00.60]This is from that dog shit Sims game I did.
[196:05.58]Grunty.
[196:06.14]Going for the ladder immediately.
[196:09.21]Oh my goodness.
[196:11.19]Bumpy Flush with a belly to back suplex.
[196:14.91]I don't think they'll ever be a winner of this match.
[196:17.83]I have to be honest.
[196:21.03]This is shit mid-card serpent bullshit.
[196:32.20]Just be happy there's not six serpents for the love of God.
[196:37.58]It's the entire slush family for God's sake.
[196:41.41]Whatever the dumb name is, who cares?
[196:50.37]I don't even know their names.
[196:54.05]Bumpy is the cat.
[196:55.89]Sus is that guy, me right there.
[196:57.91]I think that's Rathu.
[197:00.19]Is Rathu going to take it right now?
[197:03.27]No, no, no.
[197:03.81]Going up.
[197:04.77]He could get it right now.
[197:06.63]Rathu, going for the belt right now.
[197:09.21]Why is he giving me indicators?
[197:14.32]I'm not playing.
[197:15.20]I swear to God.
[197:18.97]Oh, and down goes Rattu Flush and Ratchet Flush has got the briefcase.
[197:24.31]There's no way he gets it right now.
[197:26.37]No way.
[197:27.01]No way.
[197:31.52]Somebody stop him.
[197:33.24]Stop him right now.
[197:34.18]Grunty, get up there and stop him from playing his weird mini game.
[197:41.14]Thank goodness Grunty with a couple of abdomen punches.
[197:45.61]Oh, I think Ratchet is the first.
[197:51.59]I don't know why the indicators are on screen, I swear to God.
[197:59.89]It's a fake match.
[198:00.90]And now Sussflush has the ladder.
[198:04.86]Thinking about going up himself, maybe?
[198:07.72]No, strong Henry!
[198:10.68]voted best character of the year are going to show why it seems like.
[198:14.32]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[198:15.18]Sus Flush.
[198:16.84]A couple of elbows into his head.
[198:18.04]There he goes over the top ropes.
[198:21.47]Bumpy Flush gets a double dropkick and Ratchet Flush picks up.
[198:24.91]No, he gets killed by Strong Henry Flush.
[198:30.39]No one's ever going to get this ladder up.
[198:33.52]It's not going to happen.
[198:35.96]I may as well skip this match.
[198:38.80]Because there's not a chance in hell that this ladder goes up and somebody climbs it.
[198:46.14]Prove I'm not cheating.
[198:46.98]See?
[199:00.57]Bumpy Flush takes a backhand to the back of the back by Sush Flush.
[199:08.27]I'm actually, I wonder who wins this.
[199:10.41]I have no idea who could possibly win this.
[199:14.42]They all have such shit stats too.
[199:16.30]I made sure of it.
[199:19.22]As Sussflush, I can't, dude, it's hard to say that after a bottle of champagne.
[199:22.82]Give me a break.
[199:25.14]Rathuflush takes Ratchetflush from the top turnbuckle and Grunty now resting on the side here.
[199:38.17]No one's gonna win.
[199:41.45]As Rathiu and Ratchet are on the top row.
[199:43.23]Big suplex incoming.
[199:44.45]Here it goes.
[199:44.97]On his back.
[199:45.45]Onto the ladder potentially.
[199:46.82]Oh, there it is!
[199:48.10]Huge!
[199:52.50]Big pain there on Ratchet.
[199:54.04]Flush.
[199:55.34]Wait, why did that ladder fall?
[200:04.71]As Bumpy grabs the ladder.
[200:11.59]Oh no, Bumpy now gonna maybe think about going to the top.
[200:14.36]I think it's gonna happen here.
[200:15.44]Bumpy thinking about climbing that ladder to grab the money in the bank.
[200:18.78]Is it possible?
[200:20.58]Susflush is gonna... No!
[200:21.90]Has something to say about it.
[200:23.70]A strong Henry.
[200:26.70]Does anyone care about a single character in this match?
[200:30.52]I don't.
[200:32.75]A meteor could hit the arena right now.
[200:36.83]And kill everybody in the ring.
[200:39.57]And I would not care.
[200:42.72]As Strong Henry Flush takes the ladder away from Bumpy Flush.
[200:47.44]Setting it up.
[200:48.76]Trying to get to the top.
[200:49.64]No!
[200:50.28]Closing it down.
[200:54.43]Setting it up again.
[200:56.41]And not climbing it for some reason.
[200:59.69]I think the fan favorite might be Bumpy Flush.
[201:04.13]Nope.
[201:04.65]Going to close it up again.
[201:06.87]Nope.
[201:07.23]Going to open it again.
[201:08.04]I don't think it's in the right spot.
[201:10.62]Strong Henry Flush.
[201:13.86]No, no, you can't get it from there.
[201:15.40]Gonna have to move it.
[201:18.42]You're gonna have to move it.
[201:19.88]Yep, there it is.
[201:20.84]Okay, thank you.
[201:21.56]Move it.
[201:22.66]Just, okay, doesn't care.
[201:26.71]Doesn't seem to mind.
[201:31.49]Bumpy the Betrayer.
[201:33.71]As Grunty has sauce on the ground.
[201:35.35]Look at the kicks to the sternum.
[201:41.00]I rake.
[201:44.13]No, throwing him outside.
[201:45.71]What is Ratchet doing up there?
[201:50.53]I think Strong... No, no, no.
[201:51.87]Ratchet's going to go to the outside.
[201:53.31]What are you... Why would you do that?
[201:56.69]Go into the ring where Strong Henry has got the money in the bank right now.
[202:01.90]He's got it.
[202:03.52]Let's see if he does this little weird puzzle.
[202:05.88]Don't think so.
[202:09.24]As Grunty and Strong Henry...
[202:11.98]Flush, I don't know their names.
[202:14.48]I killed them all in one day in Sims.
[202:17.96]I don't give a shit.
[202:19.08]I don't care if any of these guys die.
[202:20.96]They could live or die, and I don't care.
[202:26.71]Strong Henry.
[202:27.65]Bumpy Henry.
[202:29.83]I don't know their names.
[202:33.11]You guys all want the sus guy to win anyways.
[202:34.78]He's going up there right now.
[202:35.72]And as the sus guy reaches the top of the money in the bank, will Sus Flush win?
[202:42.55]And as best flush shit dumb fucking loser family, I don't know.
[202:51.56]No!
[202:52.44]Will he take it?
[202:53.26]No, he will not!
[202:57.52]That was so stupid.
[203:01.36]Out goes Rathuflush.
[203:02.54]Strong Henry got susflushed by the neck.
[203:04.76]Flipping up into the back and then... Make noises because you can't do commentary anymore.
[203:14.10]Has Bumpy Flush taken the ladder?
[203:16.54]I think Bumpy might get it here.
[203:19.24]Everybody's distracted.
[203:20.32]Not in a great place, but Bumpy is unhatching the latch on the Money in the Bank.
[203:24.99]Will Bumpy Flush take it?
[203:27.57]Ratchet and Strong Henry have something to say.
[203:29.91]No.
[203:31.21]No.
[203:34.50]No.
[203:43.15]As Grunty throws Bumpy out of the ring.
[203:47.37]I don't even know their names.
[203:48.72]I'm going to be honest.
[203:50.94]As Green Guy takes Elf Guy and throws Green Guy out of the ring.
[203:58.32]We've only got two left in the ring as Ratchet and Rathu.
[204:03.02]I think Rathu has a good opportunity here to set the ladder up in the middle of the ring.
[204:07.47]Looks like he does.
[204:12.04]As Grunty rolls in now.
[204:15.64]Somebody throw a grenade into the- Please, somebody throw a grenade?
[204:35.63]As Bumpy Flush gets to the top of the ladder, grabbing the briefcase,
[204:40.46]Will Bumpy.
[204:41.52]What are you doing, you idiot?
[204:44.72]Just grab it for God's sakes.
[204:48.38]Bumpy.
[204:49.72]Two right hands.
[204:50.48]Three right hands.
[204:51.24]Raking.
[204:51.82]Oh, my God.
[204:52.86]This is never going to end.
[204:59.87]Alright.
[205:00.25]Ratchet.
[205:00.69]Set it up and get the damn money.
[205:04.71]Ratchet flush.
[205:05.57]Getting the ladder set up as Bumpy is not happy about it.
[205:11.30]Six-man ladder may have been a, uh, not a great idea.
[205:15.26]I will say.
[205:18.33]Although Ratchet going up there now.
[205:21.89]Not gonna be able to do it as Sus Flush takes it.
[205:26.59]Nope.
[205:27.65]What?
[205:31.13]That's Rathu?
[205:34.42]Who cares?
[205:50.59]As Bumpy flushes, I think Bumpy's the favorite.
[205:55.31]Sus flush over the top ropes by Rathu.
[205:58.89]We've got Strong, we've got Grunty, we've got Rathu in the ring right now.
[206:03.57]Who will set the ladder up and who will actually win this?
[206:06.23]Grunty got the ladder now going in the middle of the ring.
[206:09.58]Thinking about climbing the ropes.
[206:12.78]No, don't you, oh my god, what are you doing?
[206:18.65]Grunty outside.
[206:19.55]Why would you throw Bumpy back in the ring?
[206:22.19]You don't want to put people... You want to climb the ladder.
[206:25.13]You don't want to put people back in the ring.
[206:26.56]Get up there.
[206:27.16]Grunty is thinking about winning here.
[206:31.28]Will we see a victory?
[206:32.90]I don't think so.
[206:33.88]There are too many people.
[206:35.82]The AI will always knock you down unless... I guess not?
[206:40.99]I don't know.
[206:41.61]Grunty.
[206:51.04]Bumpy, get up there and win, please.
[206:54.06]Bumpy, I got a show to run.
[206:55.22]You got to get up there.
[206:56.36]Come on, Bumpy.
[206:59.04]Bumpy, I got a show to move on with, so get up there.
[207:02.51]Bumpy flushed the cat, the meteor cat that you all love.
[207:05.83]And Ratchet flushed.
[207:07.89]Fighting now for the briefcase.
[207:09.07]Who will get the briefcase?
[207:10.07]I wonder what's going to be punching the face to Bumpy.
[207:12.75]Bumpy takes another right hand.
[207:14.67]Two more.
[207:16.12]Will Bumpy go down in a strong?
[207:17.87]Here I push over ladder.
[207:20.19]I AI.
[207:20.79]I fucking moron.
[207:22.95]You get off.
[207:24.73]Okay.
[207:25.49]Now I push you over top rope and Bumpy win.
[207:30.26]Bumpy's got it.
[207:32.40]Bumpy's got the briefcase.
[207:33.90]My fucking God.
[207:48.73]Someone set it up, please.
[207:51.55]God, use the ladder as a weapon!
[207:53.21]Stop just trying to climb it, you idiots.
[207:54.81]Remember, call the firing squad.
[208:05.48]Grunty's doing his finishing move.
[208:13.99]Call an air strike him.
[208:17.54]Alright, Ratchet's going up now.
[208:19.04]Finally, Ratchet's going to get the van.
[208:20.58]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[208:22.04]Bumpy's underneath there.
[208:26.91]I have no idea who wins this.
[208:30.79]No idea.
[208:33.09]I think Ratchet's got it.
[208:44.86]What are you doing?
[208:47.93]It's never going to end.
[208:49.79]It's never going to end.
[208:51.77]I think I have to intervene.
[208:52.99]It's not going to end.
[208:55.49]I have to intervene because I don't think it's going to end.
[209:02.45]As Grunty sets the ladder up, it's bumpy now.
[209:05.11]Outside the ring, Grunty, go.
[209:08.57]Go, get it.
[209:09.75]Complete it.
[209:10.79]End it.
[209:12.38]as grunty no strong Henry has something to say about it potentially no I don't think so might get up there in a fast enough time and there goes grunty falling back down no stop pushing the ladder over you dickheads oh my god someone please win
[209:41.72]This is so sus.
[209:43.94]Okay.
[209:49.42]Throw dice in the air.
[209:50.67]To find out who wins.
[209:51.39]Because I don't know.
[209:54.95]Oh.
[209:56.65]Matthew.
[209:58.49]Stop.
[209:59.93]Walk.
[210:02.19]You're having a lot of trouble right now.
[210:05.15]You're having a lot of trouble.
[210:06.67]I wish you would end it.
[210:07.85]But you just won't.
[210:10.37]Yeah.
[210:11.07]Okay.
[210:12.87]You could grab the ladder and set it up.
[210:15.25]Maybe climb up there and grab the money in the bank and we could do the next few awards.
[210:19.81]Or you could just get... Okay.
[210:29.37]There's two... There are other weapons they could use, too.
[210:31.99]Someone said, this is awesome.
[210:36.18]Alright.
[210:38.96]You can... Wait.
[210:39.84]Oh.
[210:45.66]Strong Henry Flush going to the top, trying to grab the money in the bank.
[210:48.80]Will he get it?
[210:50.54]He's got his hands on it.
[210:52.72]He's got his hands on it.
[210:54.85]He got it.
[210:55.39]He got it.
[210:55.81]He got it.
[210:56.25]Strong Henry Flush is your winner.
[210:59.97]Didn't win best character of the year, but won in this match.
[211:05.51]Congratulations, Strong Henry Flush.
[211:07.45]Man, what an upset.
[211:11.83]It could have been Rathu.
[211:12.71]It could have been Ratchet two times.
[211:17.13]This is what we call delete six characters from the Rumble.
[211:22.89]Because there's like 30 new characters you haven't seen in the Rumble.
[211:27.56]Okay.
[211:32.50]Let's go to the next one.
[211:33.32]Why not?
[211:33.64]Let's go.
[211:38.50]We got so many more categories.
[211:39.71]There's so many more.
[211:40.85]Oh, this one's going to be big.
[211:43.48]This is a tornado tag steel cage match.
[211:46.62]And I am very interested in this one.
[211:49.52]I'm locked in.
[211:50.40]I'm laser focused on this one.
[211:53.42]New year coming up for Mountain?
[211:58.25]Central?
[211:58.55]What is it?
[211:59.25]Mountain time?
[212:01.83]Mountain time?
[212:03.35]We'll get them all.
[212:03.89]Fuck it.
[212:04.11]Let's go.
[212:07.11]Can you punish Rathu?
[212:08.29]He's already punished.
[212:08.99]He exists.
[212:15.34]There are 30,000 people here right now.
[212:19.27]My god.
[212:22.51]Alright, Tornado Tag Steel Cage.
[212:24.69]This is a food-related match.
[212:29.97]Should we wait till the new year?
[212:31.75]For Mountain?
[212:36.19]There are only two matches after this.
[212:37.95]We're getting close.
[212:39.41]We're like another hour or two out.
[212:42.85]I'll wait.
[212:43.16]Alright, let's wait.
[212:43.68]Let's wait.
[212:43.92]Let's wait.
[212:49.02]So this is for Mountain Time coming up here.
[212:51.30]Nobody lives in Mountain Time?
[213:04.81]Lots of people live in Mountain Time.
[213:06.23]Come on.
[213:08.08]Here we go.
[213:13.40]Two minutes till New Year's Mountain Time.
[213:19.55]It's just a mountain?
[213:22.47]What is mountain?
[213:23.31]What states are in mountain time?
[213:31.56]Arizona?
[213:36.74]Colorado?
[213:40.72]Oh, who fucking cares about mountain time?
[213:42.08]Fuck it.
[213:44.58]Arizona!

[214:36.24]So bad.
[214:40.14]Alright, 30 seconds until Mountain Time New Year's.
[214:42.68]Let's count it down.
[214:43.54]Let's get it.
[214:46.38]You skipped Central?
[214:47.18]No, I didn't.
[214:47.56]We did Central.
[214:48.16]Central.
[214:51.25]Here we go!
[214:53.58]All you mountainers!
[214:56.00]Ten seconds!

[215:11.87]All acquaintance be Forgot and all acquaintance be
[215:22.44]For God and all acquaintance be.
[215:28.48]For God and all acquaintance be.
[215:32.26]Alright, the next match coming up here is a big one.
[215:45.67]Food related, like I said before.
[215:47.43]Let me make sure this is on the screen so you can see it.
[215:53.67]OHHHHH, LINK!
[215:55.21]Fuck it, who cares?
[215:58.53]Who gives a shit?
[216:09.04]Oh, that was Gordon Ramsay.
[216:12.00]The guy that's gonna get us all banned from Twitch.
[216:17.07]The guy that's gonna get all our channels shut down.
[216:22.93]The Easy Bake Oven and Gordon Ramsay.
[216:29.54]There's the Easy Bake Oven.
[216:36.34]Nice one, Ron.
[216:40.99]Was the Easy Bake Oven 2021?
[216:42.87]No, but it made the most sense to pair with Gordon Ramsay.
[216:56.62]This game sucks.
[216:57.46]Play NFL.
[216:58.40]No, we got Gordon Ramsay all the way from Hell's Kitchen, California, Las Vegas.
[217:06.14]His Wellington is unbelievable.
[217:11.84]Don't mess with the dough.
[217:13.02]Don't send him a TikTok showing you messing with his Wellington.
[217:16.86]What are you doing to my Wellington?
[217:17.92]Don't do that.
[217:23.47]Going to get us all canceled on Twitch.
[217:34.49]This is a cage match, by the way.
[217:37.63]They ain't getting out.
[217:43.72]So Gordon Ramsay and the Easy Bay Govan versus the McGriddler.
[217:51.10]Huge fast food fan.
[217:53.98]Big into McDonald's.
[217:55.66]Wendy's.
[217:56.68]Burger King.
[218:02.21]Big Burger King fan himself.
[218:10.61]There's the McRiddler from Saints Row 2.
[218:16.33]His partner is none other than, you probably saw it, I leaked it for a second, but... The point still stands.
[218:22.23]That's the Burger King long chicken sandwich.
[218:29.40]Uh, that's the only thing you should order at Burger King.
[218:34.58]Uh, everything else at Burger King sucks absolute asshole.
[218:38.02]There's two menu items at Burger King that you should order.
[218:41.22]This is one of them.
[218:43.06]The other one is just their french fries.
[218:47.76]Nothing else on that whole menu is good.
[218:51.33]I'm not going to lie to you.
[218:52.59]I have to be real.
[218:55.47]But the long chicken Burger King sandwich and their french fries and their onion rings get them up to a C tier.
[219:04.55]Or a B tier at least.
[219:10.75]The only way you win this match is if you escape the ring.
[219:15.29]No pins.
[219:17.33]No knockouts.
[219:19.59]You gotta climb that cage and get out.
[219:28.38]Close the cage down on our four combatants.
[219:30.94]Let's see what happens.
[219:31.86]Gordon Ramsay, easy bake oven, long chicken sandwich in the McGriddler.
[219:36.56]Somebody has to get out.
[219:44.27]You just have to escape.
[219:48.67]I thought he threw him over the edge.
[219:55.95]Long Chicken Sandwich is already going up there.
[219:59.06]Mick Riddler and the Long Chicken are leaving already.
[220:03.46]JKJ... I'm getting indicators already.
[220:09.22]I'm not playing the game as they're trying to both leave at the same time.
[220:13.63]Gordon Ramsay not going to have that, though, or the Easy Bake Oven.
[220:19.13]One could say they're in a gigantic oven.
[220:22.41]Enclosed.
[220:24.51]Afraid.
[220:27.81]Trying to get out of this oven.
[220:33.14]Juan Gordo.
[220:35.42]Yep, Gordon has a big advantage here.
[220:39.04]The last week or two he's had over 430,000 concurrent viewers on Twitch.
[220:44.62]He's got power behind him.
[220:46.49]He's got a lot of momentum behind him.
[220:53.13]Although not really sure that can fight against the McRiddler.
[220:57.29]Who had a month ago 16,000 concurrent viewers.
[221:04.06]That's pretty good.
[221:05.14]That's pretty good.
[221:06.02]That's pretty good.
[221:08.75]Trying to get out immediately.
[221:10.13]Can't get out.
[221:14.83]Has the long... No, Gordon now going out.
[221:17.41]Trying to climb out.
[221:19.29]Long chicken sandwich gets him by the foot.
[221:21.75]Throws him into that rough steel cage.
[221:25.37]There he goes in his Hell's Kitchen garb.
[221:30.95]The McGriddler must be so sweaty.
[221:33.76]The McChicken is too tall.
[221:43.11]Up in the air, Hurricane Rana onto the Easy Bake oven.
[221:46.27]20 community subs for Mr. Sark.
[221:47.69]Mr. Sark, how the fuck are you?
[221:50.76]Wait a minute.
[221:52.30]We have two people on opposite teams trying to get out at the same time.
[221:56.18]Will one of them get out?
[221:57.92]They have free reign.
[221:59.94]Who can climb faster?
[222:01.96]Will Gordon Ramsay get out or will the Long Chicken Sandwich get out first?
[222:06.29]Why would you punch him out when he's stupid?
[222:08.31]Pull him back into the ring.
[222:10.83]Gordon Ramsay going under the top ropes.
[222:12.43]No!
[222:13.61]Oh, this is bad.
[222:14.75]Long Chicken Sandwich making his way over.
[222:16.79]McGriddler has got Gordon Ramsay.
[222:20.16]Who is going to go over first?
[222:23.46]Gordon can't.
[222:24.30]McGriddler is distracting Gordon Ramsay as Long Chicken Sandwich is going over.
[222:29.95]Easy Bake Oven now has... Oh, it's over.
[222:32.59]That's it.
[222:32.97]It's over.
[222:34.39]You cannot come back.
[222:35.43]That's it.
[222:37.04]Long Chicken Sandwich gets over the edge.
[222:40.50]Which... Why is it not over?
[222:44.28]Wait, the McGriddler has to get over there too.
[222:46.12]Oh, shit.
[222:51.94]They both have to get over the ropes.
[222:55.47]Gordon, what are you doing?
[222:56.31]No, no, no, no.
[222:56.79]Go over.
[222:57.57]Go over.
[222:58.05]What are you doing?
[222:58.69]Don't come back in.
[223:04.08]I thought only one had to make it across.
[223:06.34]No.
[223:07.40]They both have to go.
[223:10.50]Still fighting for his life.
[223:12.02]Gordon trying to get over the top ropes.
[223:13.56]Will he get over there still?
[223:14.92]Oh, this is going to get very interesting.
[223:20.05]Gordon Ramsay, I think, made his way over into the cage.
[223:22.87]That's it.
[223:24.73]It just now comes down to these two in the middle of the ring.
[223:29.57]Gordon Ramsay definitely making it over.
[223:31.62]Easy Bake Oven now trying to climb up.
[223:35.80]No.
[223:36.60]This is going to be tough.
[223:37.66]I have no idea who's going to win.
[223:40.34]Ramsay out.
[223:41.12]Long Chicken out.
[223:45.38]McGriddler on the way out.
[223:48.86]Will we see an end to this match right now?
[223:53.32]McGriddler!
[223:55.40]Getting his leg over the top of the cage, trying to get over the Easy Bake Oven, now climbing up!
[224:01.67]You gotta pull him back, don't punch him, pull him back!
[224:05.25]Oh, shit.
[224:07.57]Oh, what an upset.
[224:09.81]If the Easy Bake Oven pulls him over, this is a huge deal.
[224:14.37]Oh, no.
[224:18.03]Both going at the same exact time.
[224:23.06]No.
[224:25.23]Start fighting.
[224:25.91]Punch, push.
[224:26.59]What are you doing?
[224:29.55]Oh, they're on the top sitting, straddling the top of the cage.
[224:32.61]Who's going to win?
[224:33.41]The McGriddler.
[224:35.67]The Easy Bay Coven.
[224:38.07]What are they doing?
[224:41.58]It's too tense.
[224:43.50]Be careful you don't knock your opponent to the left.
[224:47.18]Because they will win.
[224:48.20]I have no... Oh, that's it.
[224:52.86]That's it.
[224:56.65]Long Chicken Sandwich and the McGriddler have won this.
[225:01.70]Unless a New Year's miracle happens, I don't think we're going to see anything else.
[225:06.16]McGriddler and Long Chicken Sandwich have beaten Gordon Ramsay in the Easy Bake Oven for Victor on the food match.
[225:15.36]That's the end of that one.
[225:16.34]McGriddler and Long Chicken Sandwich.
[225:21.02]That could have gone either way.
[225:23.60]Either way.
[225:29.40]Congratulations to the McGriddler.
[225:32.23]And long chicken sandwich.
[225:35.41]Nice work.
[225:39.23]Fan favorites.
[225:42.43]Scripted.
[225:42.79]What do you mean scripted?

[225:44.67]It's all random.
[225:49.86]Okay.
[225:54.22]It's now time to get to the big categories.
[225:55.98]The meaty ones.

[249:07.45]Oh, I did something that nobody else does.
[249:09.33]Huge moment in gaming.
[249:11.87]Huge gaming moment.
[249:14.01]Is he drunk?
[249:16.09]Do you really care that much?
[249:17.68]It's New Year's Eve.
[249:18.72]I'm fucking hanging out in my goddamn office.
[249:22.76]Best gaming moment of the year.

[249:25.78]Okay, that's gonna be like a hundred.
[249:44.26]Hold.

[249:54.73]Go lateral!
[249:58.61]Oh.
[249:59.71]Let me make sure it's actually gonna work.
[250:02.29]Let's just make sure.
[250:03.79]That's it, yeah, game over, I win.
[250:05.89]Get out of here.
[250:07.33]Oh, I gotta keep it going.
[250:08.57]I gotta first try the secret bosses in every chapter, right?
[250:12.78]I have to.
[250:17.73]Let's go!
[250:18.13]Alright, alright, okay.
[250:26.73]Okay, got 73.
[250:31.33]Oh, shit.
[250:52.59]If you fly, I'll just be teleported to the backseat.
[250:59.80]Why are things exploding on the side?
[251:01.48]Because he ran over like a 15 tree.
[251:03.80]Oh, what?
[251:05.40]I got you with that?
[251:06.36]No, I didn't.
[251:06.90]I changed my zoom button.
[251:09.60]Okay, control.
[251:13.40]I shot the arrow and his head.
[251:14.60]That should be a clip.
[251:15.98]Get back on that fucking field.
[251:18.39]If I don't win this, add 10 billion to the debt.
[251:21.83]10!
[251:21.89]Over.
[251:46.36]I'm done.
[251:46.84]I'm done.
[251:47.20]I'm done.
[251:47.48]I'm done.
[251:47.68]I'm done.
[251:47.86]That's it.
[251:48.20]I'm done.

[252:08.20]Uh, someone said, my edible just kicked in, Jerma.
[252:10.18]What do I do?
[252:10.62]Relax?
[252:13.38]Sit back?
[252:14.04]Sit back?
[252:15.68]Just breathe and just watch and hang out.
[252:18.56]Relax, man.
[252:20.36]You're good.
[252:20.68]You're going to be fine.
[252:22.30]Just chill.
[252:26.21]The winner for best gaming moment of the year.
[252:34.33]Let's break it.
[252:36.97]I don't have this info.
[252:40.76]Close.
[252:42.88]Very close.
[252:45.90]Deltarune Chapter 2 Secret Boss first try again at 26.
[252:50.98]And then Mario 64 Bomb and Owl-less in the same minute at 23%.
[252:58.78]And then WarioWare 73 Super Hard Mode at 16%.
[253:01.04]Spamton.
[253:01.59]Spamton.
[253:01.97]Spamton.
[253:14.40]That was pretty good.
[253:15.74]Who else has done that?
[253:21.00]First try, Spamton, give me a break.
[253:24.58]Alright, let's see the dog shit stuff I did this year too.
[253:28.73]So if I did really good, then... I could also do really bad.
[253:37.33]Last year, I think not reading an analog clock...
[253:41.10]correctly was pretty high up there does not need to be specifically video this could be anything this does not need to be strictly video games because I couldn't read eight o'clock on an analog clock and holy I got raked over the coals for that one so here are your nominees for worst gamer moment of the year
[254:11.18]Let's see the opposite.
[254:47.38]Oh, shit, I'm... The fucking... Are the balloons keeping me up?
[254:55.19]Go down... Fucking goddammit.
[254:59.03]What do I do?
[255:02.03]I can't... They're attached!
[255:08.93]How do I get out of here?
[255:10.79]We're gonna do some jumping jacks to get your heart rate up.
[255:13.91]Let your arms hang at your side, with your feet shoulder-width apart.
[255:18.35]Oh no, it's up?
[255:18.77]I don't know how to do that.
[255:19.73]Oh shit!
[255:20.13]Is he talking?
[255:20.59]He's talking?
[255:21.01]How is he still talking?
[255:52.16]Am I supposed to be sitting down?
[255:55.24]Grab the pistol and shoot who you
[256:19.73]Iowa, nope.
[256:20.59]Pennsylvania is right here.
[256:23.83]California.
[256:26.05]That's not Cal- What do you mean not California?
[256:28.19]That's what I just clicked.
[256:29.83]I just clicked right here.
[256:35.19]Hit him!
[256:37.23]Fucking swing at him!
[256:39.79]What happened?
[256:41.27]Oh, my controller unplugged.
[256:48.12]That's why I couldn't swing at it.
[256:52.37]Are you guys ready?
[256:53.95]We're not on like a time limit or anything, but I don't want to be slow.
[256:56.09]So hold on.
[256:56.47]Let me turn this up.
[256:57.01]Alright.
[257:01.57]So turn one.
[257:03.53]I, uh, alright.
[257:07.66]There is a timer.
[257:08.46]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[257:09.94]What do you see time?
[257:10.56]Don't say that.
[257:11.18]Stop lying to me.
[257:12.44]Oh, yeah.
[257:18.34]Oh, did I do it?
[257:23.44]I didn't know there was a timer.
[257:25.48]What the fuck?
[257:27.04]I look so stupid.
[257:30.08]This is somebody that's never installed the game once.
[257:33.12]I can't fucking believe it.
[257:34.85]The interior angles of a triangle always add up to how many degrees?
[257:39.01]The interior angles of a triangle add up to 180.
[257:40.83]What did you guys put?
[257:42.11]Oh, no.
[257:43.23]Oh, they add up to... Oh, shit.
[257:45.85]When was the last time anyone even thought of a triangle?
[257:47.95]Like a fucking Dorito you ate last week?
[257:49.64]Yeah, no shit.
[257:50.34]Thank you.
[257:51.76]Oh, now I'm in trouble.
[257:55.34]It's so bad.
[257:56.60]Look at how shitty this game is.
[257:57.96]I don't care about this game.
[257:59.04]If you play Tetris for 10 minutes, you can do this okay.
[258:00.96]Okay.
[258:24.72]Ladies and gentlemen.
[258:27.04]The winner.
[258:32.03]Of the worst gaming moment of the year.
[258:39.53]Yeah, I mean that sucked.
[258:41.89]But is this my fault?
[258:43.95]Or did I just get screwed?
[258:47.05]The Mario Kart last second shell at 24% of the vote.
[258:52.98]But that's not even my fault.
[258:54.08]I got absolutely decimated.
[258:55.94]That's not my fault.
[258:57.68]It sucked, but whatever.
[258:59.40]24% of the vote, Mario Kart Last Second Shell.
[259:05.90]And then Accidental War Crime in VR.
[259:09.47]And then Jedi Lost to a Tree.
[259:17.69]I can understand the next two, but what am I supposed to do about that?
[259:23.60]That just happens in Mario Kart.
[259:24.96]You get... What am I supposed to do?
[259:28.40]Alright.
[259:30.16]Our final category before we do the last bit of the rumble.
[259:35.74]Actually, you know what?
[259:37.89]Hmm.
[259:40.25]There's four categories left.
[259:45.43]Hmm.
[259:48.27]Hmm.
[259:50.94]Hmm.
[259:54.30]There's two matches.
[259:56.94]Alright.
[259:59.32]Here we go.
[260:01.60]We're going to do the next match of the Rumble.
[260:09.33]So this is the final match of the Rumble, but until the Rumble.
[260:14.63]We got 15 minutes till New Year's.
[260:16.89]Oh, God.
[260:17.53]I knew this was going to be a long one.
[260:22.28]I'll keep this on for now.
[260:24.42]We got 15 minutes until the new year.
[260:28.70]So give me one second.
[260:31.38]There's one more match to see.
[260:33.58]And it's a dollhouse match.
[260:39.94]One would say it is the dollhouse match.
[260:43.86]I have no idea what's going to happen here.
[260:46.99]One more before the rumble.
[260:50.52]We should be able to do this and then say Happy New Year, do the last few categories, and then do the rumble.
[261:00.12]This is an eight-man, this is an eight-person dollhouse rumble.
[261:11.45]What about intermission?
[261:12.93]We'll do that after this.
[261:15.21]I promise, after this match, you can go take a piss, get a water, chill for a second.
[261:21.79]This is the last break we're going to take after this.
[261:26.48]Here we go.
[261:38.34]Are you going to be done at midnight?
[261:39.73]No.
[261:42.07]More like 1 a.m.
[261:43.57]Pacific.
[261:45.47]What the hell is going on?
[261:51.52]What?
[261:52.98]Alright, that's Community Jake, by the way.
[261:57.24]I don't know why he needs this much security.
[262:01.08]It's kind of weird.
[262:04.34]I don't know why they're being escorted by this many people.
[262:06.84]Okay.
[262:11.12]Okay.
[262:14.30]Eight person brawl.
[262:16.67]Community Jake.
[262:20.33]If you don't know, Jake is the person that put together the dollhouse.
[262:24.51]And the archaeology.
[262:26.03]And the Halloween stream.
[262:27.91]And the Bugleberry Cauldron.
[262:30.69]This is literally my manager.
[262:33.45]This is my production manager on the screen right now.
[262:35.74]And I wish him luck.
[262:38.00]Because he's got a lot more to deal with.
[262:41.84]So he's the funny one.
[262:43.14]Don't ever say that!
[262:47.12]Self insert intro.
[262:53.25]Community Jake making his debut in the Jerma Rumble.
[263:00.67]There are eight people, so we gotta go quick.
[263:12.21]Who could be next in our Dollhouse Rumble?
[263:16.75]I wonder.
[263:22.41]Getting a little dark in here.
[263:30.81]That could be, uh, if I have my eyes or not need to be checked or anything, that could be... Who's that?
[263:38.35]Oh, that's death!
[263:41.29]I had sex with this person on stream.
[263:44.10]I had sex with this person on camera.
[263:51.26]Death is your second contestant.
[263:59.20]The eight-person rumble.
[264:05.28]Weird flex.
[264:13.48]Who's next?
[264:19.40]One of the clowns.
[264:25.07]Clown man.
[264:29.97]One of the two clowns.
[264:30.77]Remember, there are two clowns, not just one.
[264:37.47]Clown man.
[264:45.57]Two clowns, seven serpents.
[264:48.65]God, no.
[264:53.73]Where's Amelia?
[264:54.55]Just hold on a minute.
[264:56.05]We've got Edna.
[264:59.09]Kitboga.
[265:01.75]Making their first appearance in the Rumble.
[265:07.13]E. Edna.
[265:08.81]Edna.
[265:15.59]It's the same dress too, which is crazy.
[265:19.38]I can't believe the same dress is here.
[265:29.38]Where are all the fans?
[265:30.22]Look at all these empty seats.
[265:31.44]What the fuck?
[265:38.40]There's the bear.
[265:48.17]Pretty good announcement.
[265:54.35]Somebody said this is a jobber match.
[265:57.46]I don't think so.
[265:58.44]This could be pretty crazy.
[266:09.31]I wonder if this takes us to the new year.
[266:11.92]I hope it does.
[266:12.46]Who's next?
[266:16.18]That is...
[266:25.39]Oh, it's Uncle Ted, by the way.
[266:27.59]Uncle Ted making his debut in the Jerma Rumble.
[266:40.87]From Las Vegas.
[266:45.24]Back from the dead.
[266:47.26]Welcome, Uncle Ted.
[266:48.10]How are you?
[266:49.58]Good to see you again.
[266:56.84]He lives in some universes.
[267:00.15]He does in some universes.
[267:04.77]Who's next?
[267:13.48]Is this the Jerma multiverse?
[267:16.74]That's the regular verse.
[267:22.11]Coming up next.
[267:26.33]It's Emilia with the bread that they wanted to have put in their mouth, serving it up on a tray.
[267:33.70]Emilia, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Rumble.
[267:35.70]Emilia.
[267:36.18]Emilia.
[267:54.69]Throwing those pancakes?
[267:58.43]Okay.
[267:59.61]Very good.
[268:03.07]The game has a very limited name selection.
[268:08.28]Who's next?
[268:11.20]It's the second clown!
[268:13.06]Clown Lady!
[268:14.34]Instead of Clown Man!
[268:19.93]Clown Lady!
[268:24.28]We got both clowns here, by the way.
[268:39.84]Clown 2, that's right.
[268:44.47]I mean, could there be anybody else?
[268:47.35]I don't think so.
[268:47.97]8-Man Dollhouse Brawl, here we go!
[268:50.49]Ring that bell!
[268:56.13]As Edna goes right for death.
[269:01.30]The two clowns might have the advantage, by the way, because they're both working together.
[269:07.38]Eight people in the ring.
[269:10.42]Absolute carnage is unfolding.
[269:12.17]Edna going for the pin on death immediately.
[269:14.31]Not even spending one second.
[269:20.75]As we got action outside the ring.
[269:23.09]Not even focused.
[269:24.28]Community Jake and the bear.
[269:26.13]Outside.
[269:27.19]Fighting.
[269:28.75]I don't think there are very... There are no rules, by the way.
[269:31.89]Zero.
[269:33.43]Weapons.
[269:34.23]Count.
[269:35.51]Furniture.
[269:35.99]Count.
[269:36.91]Balls.
[269:37.39]Count.
[269:38.13]Anywhere.
[269:41.14]It's going to be hard to pay attention to what's going on on the screen.
[269:48.06]As Uncle Ted is already dead.
[269:51.88]The third time.
[269:55.56]Good luck paying attention to any of this.
[270:01.43]Balls count anywhere.
[270:04.87]Edna and Clown Lady outside.
[270:06.67]Where's... Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[270:08.71]Sorry.
[270:09.01]Emilia, Clown Lady outside.
[270:10.55]Edna with death in the middle of the ring.
[270:15.15]The ref doesn't even know where to go.
[270:18.61]This is not Flush Family.
[270:21.47]This is the dollhouse.
[270:24.92]I got my money on Edna.
[270:26.62]If I would have bet $5, it would go on Edna right now.
[270:34.12]We got five minutes to the New Year in Pacific time.
[270:36.97]I am ready.
[270:37.93]I'm waiting for it.
[270:42.69]It's going to be carnage here.
[270:45.91]As Amelia and Community... Amelia with a big uppercut on Community Jack's face.
[270:50.31]Right in his chin.
[270:51.81]Right directly on the ball of his chin.
[270:55.27]Weapon time.
[270:57.29]Amelia going under the ropes into the apron looking for a weapon.
[271:01.21]No!
[271:01.67]Clown lady picks up Amelia.
[271:05.64]No weapons so far.
[271:07.58]Going for a pin.
[271:08.50]Clown man on death.
[271:09.74]Will he get it?
[271:11.72]I don't know who's being pinned right now, but somebody is.
[271:18.40]It's going to be hard for the referee.
[271:19.60]It's going to be like babysitting children.
[271:26.01]Why is the ref not over here?
[271:28.95]Go over here.
[271:30.03]He's all the way to the left.
[271:31.45]There's all the actions on the right, man.
[271:33.09]Get over there.
[271:36.57]The bear... Ted is in a submission right now.
[271:41.55]USA.
[271:46.81]Edna's got... Somebody's being pinned.
[271:48.92]Well, Edna powerbomb on the clown man.
[271:51.24]Will he get the pin?
[271:53.00]Referee, where's the referee?
[271:55.56]No, not even close.
[271:58.78]Not even remotely close.
[272:00.24]Not even a one count.
[272:04.68]Somebody else being pinned outside.
[272:10.49]Good luck knowing who's going to win this shit.
[272:14.65]Uncle Ted and the bear.
[272:15.61]Where Uncle Ted is technically dead.
[272:20.65]It might have some ghostly abilities.
[272:23.55]I'm not sure.
[272:26.34]As Edna throwing two people into the ring.
[272:28.36]Edna now really fired up.
[272:34.73]I'd love to see a pin right here from Edna.
[272:37.63]Big belly to back suplex on the clown man.
[272:43.57]Three minutes till New Year's.
[272:44.87]That's right.
[272:49.38]Paunting.
[272:50.60]Who's being pinned?
[272:52.20]Clown lady has... Emilia almost got pinned there.
[272:55.66]That was...
[272:56.51]Damn.
[272:58.45]That was close.
[272:59.05]That was the closest one so far.
[273:00.01]That was like two and a quarter.
[273:03.19]As Community Jake and Death fighting out there.
[273:06.05]What an unbelievable knee smashing move by Edna.
[273:12.99]Edna going for a pin.
[273:13.95]Will they get it?
[273:14.60]Two.
[273:17.56]No.
[273:18.50]So close.
[273:19.52]Whose camera is this?
[273:20.54]Go fucking zoom in, idiot.
[273:22.74]Who's pinned?
[273:29.80]Who is filming this?
[273:31.34]This camera sucks.
[273:35.61]Lean forward two seats, man.
[273:37.61]Throw the camera down five rows.
[273:39.45]What the hell are you doing?
[273:42.81]Oh my God, what a terrible camera.
[273:47.27]Edna now going into the staircase as Community Jake is being pinned right now by death.
[273:53.89]No.
[273:56.95]What?
[273:58.22]What happened?
[273:59.40]Somebody got eliminated?
[274:00.24]Who got eliminated?
[274:01.12]Who?
[274:01.58]What?
[274:03.46]What the fuck happened?
[274:07.21]Everybody sit down in front of me.
[274:09.05]I can't see shit.
[274:12.13]The bear got eliminated.
[274:13.91]Oh my god.
[274:19.68]Great view.
[274:22.90]What's happening?
[274:25.20]So many...
[274:40.76]30 seconds till New Year's.
[274:49.09]The bear has been eliminated, by the way.
[274:51.87]Happy fucking New Year to all you Pacific Coasters.
[274:55.27]Thanks for watching.
[275:00.33]10 seconds.
[275:03.41]Will you move the camera for God's sakes?
[275:05.77]I can't see anything.
[275:15.12]And all acquaintance be forgot.
[275:19.82]I'd love this camera to move.
[275:22.64]I have no idea who's winning this game.
[275:28.04]Somebody just got eliminated and we don't know who.
[275:30.86]I guess it was death.
[275:35.92]They need to come from... No, Happy New Year.
[275:40.04]Seriously, guys.
[275:41.04]Thanks for watching.
[275:43.33]Cheers to you, bottoms up to you, thanks for watching the channel.
[275:47.29]I think to- Who- Jake's elimi- Who's- What?
[275:57.39]No, death- No, community Jake got eliminated, damn.
[276:02.80]Can we move maybe to the ring?
[276:07.22]It would be great if we could move to the ring, that'd be amazing.
[276:16.27]Go into the ring, what are you doing?
[276:18.20]Oh my god.
[276:22.88]Death is pinning somebody.
[276:25.76]The game cannot handle this.
[276:27.53]Edna's still in the ring.
[276:34.07]The two clowns are fighting on the left side.
[276:36.54]This is not supposed to be happening.
[276:44.18]You would think they would work together, but no.
[276:48.46]They're fighting.
[276:49.16]They want to eliminate each other.
[276:52.88]As Amelia and Death are fighting.
[276:54.64]Clown's fighting.
[276:55.60]Edna and Uncle Ted.
[276:59.78]Where's the ref?
[277:05.76]The cameraman is zonked.
[277:09.80]Where's the referee?
[277:12.32]He's counting... He's counting the clowns.
[277:16.26]Uncle Ted's got Amelia!
[277:17.31]No, no, no, no, no.
[277:17.93]That's the wrong character.
[277:18.97]I'm sorry.
[277:20.49]It's kind of fucked up.
[277:21.69]It's hard to pay attention to what's going on right now.
[277:25.79]The clowns are just playing.
[277:26.99]Death and Amelia, Edna and Uncle Ted and the two clowns.
[277:31.62]The two senior citizens fighting it over on the right side while the two clowns on the left side... Death and Amelia in the middle!
[277:38.06]That was a big roar.
[277:47.92]Get in the ring.
[277:50.27]Edna is pinning Uncle Ted.
[277:53.35]One.
[277:53.51]Two.
[277:53.59]Nope.
[277:56.11]Almost.
[278:07.25]One of the clowns is being pinned?
[278:10.42]The chairs are back.
[278:11.34]Yep.
[278:17.16]Okay.
[278:20.90]I have no idea who wins this.
[278:26.10]The ref was counting and nobody was pinned.
[278:30.56]Clown lady on clown man.
[278:31.94]Let's go.
[278:33.22]No.
[278:33.62]No pin.
[278:35.46]Can I play Terraria?
[278:37.44]Jesus.
[278:38.22]Ban that guy.
[278:39.48]Ban that guy for 10 minutes.
[278:41.90]I'm not going to play Terraria right now, dude.
[278:51.15]I don't know where to look.
[278:55.35]There's so many places to look.
[278:56.79]I don't know where to look.
[279:01.07]I think Uncle Ted is the upper hand.
[279:02.79]I think Clown Man is the upper hand.
[279:07.25]Amelia going full ham on death right now.
[279:18.74]Big pin.
[279:19.26]Amelia's got the pin here.
[279:21.97]I keep saying Amelia, it's Edna, you idiot.
[279:25.85]Fireworks are going off right now.
[279:27.19]Well, this is it.
[279:27.87]This is New Year now.
[279:35.09]What happened?
[279:36.63]What?
[279:38.07]Wait, did Edna get killed?
[279:39.31]Did Ted kill Edna?
[279:41.11]Wait, what?
[279:41.45]Why are they out?
[279:50.90]They shouldn't be out right now.
[279:54.78]Uncle Ted going for the pin on Clown Lady.
[279:56.92]No, death does not want any part of that at all.
[280:01.90]Oh, poor Edna.
[280:02.96]Edna has been eliminated down to five.
[280:05.28]They were eight.
[280:07.52]They don't want to get back in the ring, I guess.
[280:16.84]God damn it, man.
[280:20.38]I think Clown Lady has Uncle Ted pinned right now.
[280:23.52]The ref, get over here.
[280:26.36]What's the ref doing?
[280:34.79]Big reversal by Clown Lady on to death.
[280:39.36]I think Uncle Ted has this in the bag.
[280:43.32]If I bet money, it goes on Uncle Ted for sure.
[280:52.11]You should do Simpsons versus Griffins.
[280:53.99]I'm not going to do that.
[281:00.72]We got another pin on Amelia.
[281:04.58]Only a two count.
[281:13.29]I wish they would get back in the ring.
[281:14.87]It's just, come on, man.
[281:16.41]Give me a break.
[281:17.23]Death on Uncle Ted.
[281:18.49]Will we see Ted eliminated here?
[281:19.93]No, two count.
[281:30.36]Can you do commentary in binary?
[281:32.04]Wait, what?
[281:34.66]What happened?
[281:35.10]Who left?
[281:35.50]0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1.
[281:39.48]What the fuck?
[281:40.26]What happened?
[281:40.72]0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1.
[281:41.65]Oh, Edna left.
[281:42.43]Okay.
[281:42.67]They're double teaming Uncle Ted right now.
[281:58.65]Yeah, Happy New Year, T2.
[282:00.51]Happy New Year.
[282:05.50]Oh, my God.
[282:06.04]The referee is so slow.
[282:08.90]One, two.
[282:10.18]Nope.
[282:11.62]Two clowns both in.
[282:13.02]Death's still in.
[282:13.76]And Amelia's still in, too.
[282:18.87]Amelia, though.
[282:21.63]Ooh.
[282:22.37]Close.
[282:26.18]You gotta figure they're getting tired.
[282:27.74]You can't keep going forever.
[282:36.43]They're so far away from the ring at this point.
[282:43.75]Ooh, Amelia could go for a ping, a pin right now.
[282:48.28]I, no, no, got reverse punched in the face.
[282:55.58]Someone's going very soon here And I don't think can they go backstage, I don't think I can I'm not sure they actually can make it backstage Big dropping knee on death pin them.
[283:14.44]Let's see it.
[283:15.00]Come on elimination.
[283:15.96]Let's go Uncle Ted and clown lady
[283:22.95]Somebody pin death!
[283:24.87]Get rid of death, let's go!
[283:35.84]Somebody do something that's not punching, please!
[283:44.55]Alright, finally.
[283:52.42]They're bullying Death.
[283:53.62]Yeah, I would love to see a pin.
[283:56.86]That's a reversal.
[283:57.78]I don't think Uncle Ted can take more than that though.
[284:02.79]The fatigue has to be setting in.
[284:05.97]Amelia now.
[284:08.85]Oh!
[284:10.27]Ow.
[284:10.87]Ooh.
[284:12.68]Death's getting pinned.
[284:13.70]Why would you break that up?
[284:15.14]Don't break it up when he's stupid.
[284:16.64]You dumb idiot.
[284:17.70]What's wrong with you?
[284:18.52]Why?
[284:23.11]it might come down to the two clowns it might Amelia just barely getting up now Uncle Ted a few right hands or left hands probably left hand Ted going crazy right now death with a big reversal and Amelia is holding the clown man while clown lady double team here
[284:50.01]Someone pin someone for the love of God.
[284:53.13]Here we go.
[284:59.10]It's a one.
[285:01.04]Oh my goodness.
[285:15.58]There is some history here with Ted and death.
[285:19.48]There's a lot of history.
[285:23.30]If we see a Ted pinning death here, this is a big deal here.
[285:26.77]And Clown pinning Illumina.
[285:28.87]I can't even say words.
[285:34.21]Oh, Emilia barely gets out because of the length of time it took.
[285:47.76]Someone pin somebody.
[286:00.89]Okay.
[286:02.75]Okay, pin death.
[286:11.37]Emilio!
[286:12.13]Oh my god, please.
[286:26.73]Somebody said, if this doesn't make you want to play Destiny 2 PvP, what will?
[286:33.51]I will never open that game.
[286:35.55]Please, just, I'm not going to play it.
[286:38.09]Come on, dude, leave me alone.
[286:46.73]Big clothesline from Emilia onto the Clown Man.
[286:57.64]Somebody do something, please.
[287:04.91]Someone, please, do something, please!
[287:07.31]Death?
[287:16.45]Nope.
[287:19.75]Oh!
[287:20.35]We're gonna pin.
[287:23.75]Nope.
[287:24.37]Kicked out.
[287:35.62]I don't think this is not going to end.
[287:40.85]Somebody said this might actually be bugged.
[287:44.15]I don't.
[287:46.37]I don't think so.
[287:49.42]Death pinning Uncle Ted.
[287:50.86]Will we get to see the rectification of?
[287:52.54]No.
[287:54.52]No.
[287:58.99]Oh, geez.

[288:16.29]Someone die.
[288:17.89]Right now.
[288:30.25]You should do the categories while this continues.
[288:33.77]No, no, no.
[288:35.43]These are special categories.
[288:39.38]Oh my god.
[288:40.20]Death is pinning Uncle Ted!
[288:47.04]Why?
[288:47.50]I don't know why they're not winning.
[289:03.08]Should I take control and move to the ring?
[289:08.70]Do picture in picture.
[289:20.61]Alright, I'm a little starved for time right now.
[289:24.57]We're gonna have to move on.
[289:27.97]Wait!
[289:31.51]Clown Lady just pinned Clown Man.
[289:33.45]Clown Man eliminated.
[289:35.41]We're down to four.
[289:42.63]Has Uncle Ted going for a submission?
[289:45.41]Amelia with a pin on Clown Lady.
[289:48.09]One.
[289:48.97]Two.
[289:50.37]One.
[289:51.23]Two.
[289:52.66]Ugh.
[289:57.52]Someone's going out again here now.
[290:02.50]Uncle Ted now on the ground.
[290:03.96]All of them.
[290:05.60]Zero fatigue.
[290:06.72]Zero energy.
[290:08.29]Uncle Ted now from the receiving end.
[290:09.91]No.
[290:10.25]Breaks out.
[290:18.46]This is not the rumble.
[290:19.59]We still have that to do.
[290:22.21]That's coming up next.
[290:24.17]After we do the final categories.
[290:29.25]That is where we will end the stream in about 30 minutes from now.
[290:34.64]I would love to claim a victor for the dollhouse brawl.
[290:41.44]Wait!
[290:41.70]We get a pin!
[290:43.90]I don't know who's pinning who.
[290:45.63]I have no idea.
[290:59.16]will probably end somewhere around 1 a.m.
[291:02.14]Pacific.
[291:05.49]What's going on in the right here?
[291:06.69]I have no idea.
[291:16.53]Please, somebody win.
[291:20.12]They've been punching each other in the face out of the ring for 10 straight minutes.
[291:27.23]Someone just pull out a grenade or a gun already.
[291:30.83]Uncle Ted's got death!
[291:33.49]Oh my god.
[291:38.43]Just shoot somebody with a gun.
[291:44.17]Alright, that's it.
[291:45.37]Pin death.
[291:46.15]Uncle Ted, let's go.
[291:48.35]Let's go.
[291:48.71]Amelia lasted this long.
[292:03.10]Down to the final four.
[292:13.89]Losing viewers?
[292:14.85]It's because it's like 3 o'clock in the morning Eastern.
[292:19.27]Don't worry, we're gonna be alright.
[292:21.61]Someone will win.
[292:33.87]PIN SOMEBODY!
[292:44.54]We're gonna move on to the finale in just a second once there's a winner crown of the Dollhouse Brawl!
[292:53.75]Someone just needs to pin somebody.
[293:00.13]Alright!
[293:01.57]Death has got Uncle Ted on the ropes!
[293:03.95]Oh, fuck you.
[293:04.89]I'm about to get control and start fucking punching people.
[293:07.13]Oh my god.
[293:24.43]Why is this game so bad?
[293:27.55]Someone get pinned.
[293:39.73]Do something!
[293:41.69]I can't do anything about this!
[293:51.85]What are they doing?!
[293:56.45]What are they doing?!
[293:58.03]Please win, someone!
[294:00.45]It's been 20 minutes!
[294:12.68]Oh my God.
[294:18.08]Dude.
[294:35.40]I don't know why they're doing this.
[294:38.50]I have no control of this scenario.
[294:40.60]I have no control.
[294:43.30]This game sucks.
[294:46.66]And I know they waited two years to make the new one.
[294:49.47]I don't fucking buy it.
[294:50.39]It's going to be just as bad.
[294:51.27]Another pin.
[294:54.55]Here we go.
[295:09.04]Oh god, I broke it.
[295:11.78]I crashed it.
[295:14.82]I think it actually was bugged.
[295:17.39]Because I just crashed the game.
[295:27.35]Oh my fucking god, you gotta be kidding me.
[295:34.76]I think it actually was bugged out.
[295:52.06]I think it was waiting for me to intervene so it could crash.
[295:58.84]God, the 2K games are fucking dog shit.
[296:03.63]I'm going to hold my breath for 2K22 because I expect it to be fucking horse shit.
[296:08.93]I expect it to be the worst fucking game ever made at this point.
[296:14.07]Those are your four winners of the dollhouse brawl.
[296:23.57]I gotta pee.
[296:24.25]I'll be right back.
[296:26.10]I'll be right back.
[296:26.82]We're gonna get this sorted and then I'm gonna do the last categories and I'm gonna go pee.
[296:30.61]See you guys in two minutes.
[298:36.30]Thank you.
[300:21.17]Hello!
[300:22.89]I have returned.
[300:25.40]Uncle Ted was robbed.
[300:29.26]Oh shit, hot mic!
[300:43.07]Okay, so what we're gonna do... Hey John, how's your cat doing?
[300:47.55]Garfield- I fuck Garfield, I don't care.
[300:58.64]So, we're going to go right to the rumble.
[301:02.14]No, you know, we'll do the categories first.
[301:04.92]That makes the most sense, I think, right?
[301:07.70]I think so.
[301:09.76]We are down.
[301:10.40]I want to get through these.
[301:11.40]We're at the final categories.
[301:16.76]We're at worst meltdown now.
[301:18.62]What the heck?
[301:25.90]I gotta have good hair.
[301:27.54]It's 12.30 in the morning, but let's go.
[301:31.86]So, worst meltdown is the... You look good.
[301:35.16]Thanks, man.
[301:37.50]I can't believe there are this many people still here at like fucking 3 o'clock in the morning Eastern.
[301:43.64]So, worst meltdown of the year in 2021.
[301:46.79]You look like shit.
[301:53.19]I'm coming after you.
[301:56.65]Uh, this is, as you know, times when I got pissed.
[302:01.08]I got annoyed.
[302:01.72]I had a little, maybe, too much to say about a certain video game, or... I mean, I just said that 2K20 was a fucking bag of shit.
[302:12.68]I can't believe they sold that game for $60.
[302:16.26]In fact, it's fucking insulting that that game was sold for more than $5.
[302:20.05]I believe that for real.
[302:23.93]I can't believe that game was sold for more than $10.
[302:27.38]Okay.
[302:31.29]Get off the screen.
[302:32.07]I don't want to see that.
[302:34.87]Your nominees for worst meltdown of the year are as follows.
[302:54.19]That character the characters like why was most wait what the character that character said what I was like What
[303:14.43]You can't change the fucking rules!
[303:17.05]You can't change the rules!

[303:27.93]I just... Dead Ringer!
[303:29.63]Kill that spy!
[303:30.45]I don't... I'm done.
[303:37.13]I'm done.
[303:37.61]I'm skipping the level.
[303:39.11]I'm skipping the level.
[303:42.39]What?
[303:44.31]Shit.
[303:46.41]Oh my god, I hate this place.
[303:49.83]Irwin, you fucking suck.
[303:50.87]Stop saying that.
[303:51.59]It's making me unconscious.
[303:53.53]It's making me self-conscious.
[303:54.57]Stop saying that.
[303:58.93]This game sucks.
[304:01.07]This game fucking sucks.
[304:03.55]It's awful.
[304:04.81]It's awful.
[304:06.45]It's awful.
[304:07.43]This was so intense.
[304:08.53]What a fucking storybook ending this would have been, but I forgot.
[304:11.19]The game's terrible.
[304:16.66]Great catch, Danny Phantom.
[304:18.00]Great catch, Danny.
[304:20.30]Ah, he just jumped in and grabbed that.
[304:21.92]He really just jumped into the ball, Danny.
[304:25.32]And the dramedary.
[304:27.34]I can't be live.
[304:36.13]What am I doing here?
[304:37.37]What am I doing here?
[304:38.93]What am I doing here?
[304:39.97]Ludd said we can be 10 minutes late, so I'm assuming we're starting in 10 minutes.
[304:44.53]Okay, cool.
[304:48.29]Guys, I'm freaking out!
[304:49.05]I just muted indefinite.
[304:49.91]I'm freaking out.
[304:50.57]Alright, I'm gonna try.
[304:52.58]I just spilled coffee all over me.
[304:54.80]I'm not even fucking ready.
[304:56.18]Alright, alright.
[305:00.68]No, I'm not.
[305:02.04]I'm tired.
[305:02.64]I just woke up.
[305:04.28]How is that... How can there not be 90 FOV in a 1920 by 1080 game?
[305:11.03]Like, the ability to have it without it being... That doesn't make any sense.
[305:17.03]I would have... Fuck Capcom!
[305:19.63]Fuck you, Capcom!
[305:20.97]Capcom sucks!
[305:22.43]That would have... I just ruined my game experience.
[305:24.57]That would have, like, scared me, and I would have been like, holy shit, that was so scary.
[305:28.25]Are you fucking kidding me?
[305:29.55]I'm sorry.
[305:30.29]I have no fucking... I have absolutely no sympathy for any of this shit.
[305:34.56]If a game is gonna release on PC, and it's after 2008, if it's not 90 FOV, just throw the whole thing in the garbage and start over.
[305:47.37]Is he wrong, though?
[305:50.37]It's the worst console!
[305:52.27]It's the worst console!
[305:54.07]It's the worst console!
[305:55.36]They've gotta make them little, like, little fucking, like, hamburger slices!
[306:00.06]Oh, but look, it's cute!
[306:01.22]Oh, it's the Switch!
[306:03.80]Oh, yeah!
[306:04.58]It fits in a baby's hand!
[306:06.60]Yeah!
[306:08.63]Yeah!
[306:24.27]It just keeps going.
[306:28.86]No!
[306:29.48]Come on!
[306:30.24]Right when I got the star off.
[306:32.38]Give me a fucking break.
[306:35.42]Is one of us in tent?
[306:38.15]Speak now.
[306:38.51]I'm about to grip it.
[306:58.39]Some pretty bad ones this year.
[307:01.97]The worst in particular, though.
[307:05.43]By a lot.
[307:06.73]This was not even close.
[307:09.18]Which is really surprising.
[307:13.96]Your worst meltdown of the entire year... is... WarioWare.
[307:23.71]WarioWare with 38% of the vote.
[307:27.71]Swept it.
[307:29.15]Destroyed everybody else.
[307:31.37]Nicktoons Baseball and the Capcom rant.
[307:35.64]We're at 2 and 3.
[307:36.06]38, 22, and 13, respectively.
[307:37.84]WarioWare took it.
[307:38.46]I mean, I...
[307:46.14]I was melting my brain during that stream.
[307:51.11]Alright, the next one is pretty special to me because obviously it's not best stream of the year, it's not worst stream of the year.
[307:58.85]It's best dollhouse moment of the year.
[308:03.55]Every time I see clips of this show and clips of people, hey, that was fun, that was cool, the dollhouse thing.
[308:10.81]This could have won probably every category.
[308:14.20]It could have won Best Joke, Best Dream, Best Meltdown.
[308:18.14]I didn't want to have it nominated for every single category.
[308:21.96]But it has a huge place in my heart as some of the most fun I've probably ever had in my life.
[308:28.76]So watching the music play and different characters come on screen and stuff, it's really fun to watch.
[308:35.97]Because I have not really seen it.
[308:38.52]I don't really... I don't watch a whole lot of the stuff that I do, really.
[308:43.68]So seeing random clips every now and then is like, oh yeah, that was a lot of fun.
[308:50.91]So this one is kind of special.
[308:53.17]Because this gets its own category.
[308:55.37]It does not get... It would have swept every other category, so we made it its own category.
[309:03.36]It's got a special place here.
[309:05.06]Right here.
[309:06.70]So this is the best dollhouse moment from the dollhouse dreams.
[309:11.81]And here we go.
[309:13.63]I'm very curious.
[309:28.38]It's a what scene?
[309:29.73]Oh, so would you like to spend an evening together?
[309:32.15]Is what I'm asking.
[309:35.65]Would you still respect me if I said yes?
[309:38.85]Absolutely.
[309:40.33]Okay, let's go.
[309:42.48]Okay, let's go.
[309:43.60]Gucci, Gucci, Gucci.
[309:44.62]Come on.
[309:45.20]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[309:48.58]I don't want to fight him.
[309:49.84]He's huge.
[309:50.62]He's huge.
[309:50.96]He's a huge guy.
[309:51.86]He's a huge fighter.
[309:53.36]Steve, keep... Oh, fuck.
[309:59.54]Oh, shit.
[310:00.67]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[310:09.12]Okay, alright.
[310:10.76]Alright, I need two shadows in here.
[310:13.06]Oh yeah, that's a bad dream for Jorma.
[310:15.94]Then Jorma poops himself.
[310:17.90]This is Kensington's class.
[310:19.28]He poops himself in front of everybody.
[310:21.22]No, no, I didn't poop my pants in front of everybody.
[310:23.27]And then a cowboy comes out of the shower.
[310:25.33]I didn't poop my pants in front of everybody.
[310:32.25]No!
[310:33.75]No, I didn't shit myself!
[310:37.19]That's very good.
[310:39.69]Very easy.
[310:40.25]Hey, Jeff, let me see that for a second!
[310:42.31]Let me show you something, Jeff!
[310:48.52]Hey, Jeff, get a load of this!
[310:53.44]I've never been more afraid in my life than right now.
[310:56.14]Back in, like, during, like, school plays, there'd be, like, fucking 40 people in the audience.
[311:01.73]Remix!
[311:05.83]Remix!
[311:08.30]God came down to the land in the land.
[311:11.12]God came down to the land in the land.
[311:14.02]I can't believe what's happening right now.
[311:17.00]I can't believe what's happening right now.
[311:19.76]Wait, where's it going?
[311:22.10]Wait, what?
[311:25.97]Am I sick?
[311:27.65]Do I have, like, the norovirus?
[311:30.29]Like, what's happening?
[311:32.09]Sir?
[311:32.99]Yeah?
[311:33.71]Are you alright?
[311:34.81]I'm okay in here.
[311:35.63]You don't have to come in.
[311:36.67]Do you have a big mess you need cleaning?
[311:38.55]Why don't you grab a piece of bread?
[311:41.23]I want you to eat.
[311:43.51]Well, I've been cleaning.
[311:44.41]I wouldn't dare touch it with my hands.
[311:46.57]Right, but just eat.
[311:48.47]Wash your hands and then eat.
[311:52.25]I'm not putting it in your mouth.
[311:53.47]Right, no, of course.
[311:55.90]What did you, I don't know, what did you steal?
[311:57.22]Did you steal anything?
[311:58.36]What are you doing in my house?
[311:59.58]It's like a flash mine!
[312:01.26]Oh, shit!
[312:02.50]Ow, my eyes!
[312:03.96]Ow!
[312:05.87]Oh, my eyes!
[312:06.95]You give me a drink or something and I'm gonna head out.
[312:10.17]You want a drink?
[312:11.07]Give me a glass of water or something.
[312:13.51]I'll get you a glass of water.
[312:14.45]Where do you keep your glasses?
[312:16.83]I'll get you a glass of water, Jesus.
[312:18.50]Okay.
[312:20.16]How about that?
[312:20.66]It's right there.
[312:23.44]Get a glass of water.
[312:25.48]What, uh...
[312:26.80]What are you doing?
[312:28.56]What are you doing?
[312:29.48]What are you doing?
[312:31.81]What the fuck are you doing?
[312:33.23]This is my, no, no, no, no, no, excuse me, this is my house.
[312:36.65]I'm like, why am I hiding outside of my own house?
[312:39.49]I'm hiding, alright, no, I'm not fucking, I need to eat out of that peanut butter later and now I'm not going to.
[312:44.83]I'm not eating out of that peanut butter.
[312:48.74]Hey!
[312:48.96]Hey!
[312:50.08]Oh, camellia!
[312:51.97]Sorry.
[312:53.37]What?
[312:54.53]Amelia, how are you?
[312:55.47]Who is that?
[312:56.51]That's just a bunch of pillows.
[312:59.13]That's just a bunch of pillows?
[313:00.49]Yeah, look, it's just pillows like black pillows.
[313:02.19]It's a collection of moving sentient pillows.
[313:04.81]I can't believe this.
[313:05.79]You can take this and you can take him, you shitter.
[313:09.36]No, no.
[313:10.08]I hope it was nice.
[313:10.62]Amelia, just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[313:13.12]No.
[313:14.20]You missed your chance.
[313:16.08]You don't know how high I can fly.
[313:31.02]That shit was so much fun.
[313:34.42]So the winner for best dollhouse moment of the year... Well, the best dollhouse moment of that show... Is... Landslide.
[313:50.73]Going through the window at 45% of the vote.
[313:54.64]Almost half of you guys said going through the window.
[313:57.78]And then under that, woohooing death and caught by Emilia with 13 and 10% of the vote.
[314:07.83]That was awesome.
[314:08.67]That was so much fun.
[314:11.23]I can't wait to try to do more stuff like that in 2022.
[314:15.19]That's the goal.
[314:16.69]The goal is if you like Dollhouse, I mean, there won't be a Dollhouse 2 necessarily, but I'm trying to do more shit like that in the next year.
[314:26.37]It was so much fun.
[314:28.89]Ludwig was fucking unbelievable.
[314:31.38]Such a fucking class act.
[314:32.70]So funny.
[314:34.14]Milton, Kit Boga.
[314:37.88]These are people that are unbelievably talented and should get all the credit because that shit was fucking hilarious to me.
[314:46.79]Alright, it's time to get fucking sentimental, boys and girls.
[314:50.27]Time to get sentimental.

[315:25.59]You can't say that every year.
[315:26.71]Not every year.
[315:28.59]It can't be every year.
[315:33.56]Here are your nominees for worst stream of the year.
[315:37.84]I know that people don't like certain video games.
[315:40.10]People don't like certain fucking impressions and noises I make.
[315:43.09]Fine, I'll shut up.
[315:43.85]Fine.
[315:49.91]Burger Day, Secret Lab.
[315:51.19]What about the con- I need to go to the convention.
[316:00.67]Great.
[316:01.27]I'm stuck here forever.
[316:02.09]I think I can sleep in the bed, I think.
[316:07.51]Yeah, we're good.
[316:08.27]Yeah, I missed a trend!
[316:12.97]Oh, come the fuck on.
[316:14.17]What the hell?
[316:15.01]If a hotel does not have at least three stars on... I'm walking in a circle!
[316:20.83]One brain Andy!
[316:22.14]I can't do anything!
[316:23.94]I can't fucking do anything!
[316:25.98]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[316:27.60]Jerma here with Smite Sunday.
[316:29.90]Welcome to the first Smite Sunday on this channel.
[316:31.70]Wait, what?
[316:32.74]Wait, I say Smite Sunday?
[316:35.38]Where's a time machine where I can, like, not queue up for conquest?
[316:46.50]If I had three wishes, one of them would be to not play Conquest tonight.
[316:50.12]That's exactly what we needed to have happen.
[316:52.08]Good job.
[316:52.80]That was the Achilles and the Gilgamesh.
[316:54.39]Nice job.
[316:56.95]I'm not even looking at the screen.
[316:58.37]Oh my god, please don't kill me!
[317:00.65]I can't wait for next week's Smite Thursday.
[317:02.41]This is never happening ever again.
[317:04.21]Fix it, fix it, fix it.
[317:05.95]There's nothing I can do about fixing it.
[317:07.13]I can't.
[317:09.67]I can't!
[317:10.59]Don't you get it?
[317:11.21]I can't.
[317:11.65]The mic that I was using just broke and it doesn't work anymore.
[317:17.15]I have to get a new one eventually, but you have to deal with this for now.
[317:20.03]Sorry, what the fuck?
[317:22.37]He's getting closer.
[317:24.55]He's gonna get clo- oh, oh, look at this.
[317:26.29]Look at how close the one in the middle is getting to the camera.
[317:32.66]He's fucking smoking a cigarette.
[317:39.18]Um, what?
[317:40.32]I don't want to watch this one.
[317:41.60]Fart on stream when your dead is erased?
[317:43.03]How about I fart into the microphone with the echo?
[317:49.44]Just put it under there.
[317:54.17]I- it- that's cleared.
[317:54.99]The dead is now clear.
[317:56.09]That's clear.
[317:56.55]Come on, you can make it.
[317:59.47]It's getting to be nighttime.
[318:08.46]No!
[318:09.14]It is a tree.
[318:10.22]I- it didn't even load in my game.
[318:11.80]Fuck!
[318:14.36]There's a tree on every side.
[318:16.36]This is the worst possible thing I could have done.
[318:19.19]Where's the road?
[318:19.75]I'm not even halfway.
[318:22.07]I turned around.
[318:25.47]How did I turn around?
[318:26.57]I'm facing this way now?
[318:28.00]How?
[318:28.42]What?
[318:29.30]What does this guy look like?
[318:34.47]Alright, there you go.
[318:35.72]You got what you wanted, everybody that was here.
[318:37.88]You got the imposterous fucking stupid-ass sus face.
[318:42.61]You got it.
[318:43.65]I just realized that's what I just did.
[318:59.65]$500 million in research.
[319:02.55]Like 10 years of developing this place.
[319:07.25]Telescopes.
[319:10.98]Equipment.
[319:12.38]Radars.
[319:14.66]Lightspeed we can see into the distance.
[319:18.65]And I picked a shoe up on the ground, and that's how I found them.
[319:21.31]Okay, I have to stop.
[319:22.59]Look, this is just the shit.
[319:24.48]I'm trying to get to fucking 7% phone battery, okay?
[319:27.12]This is the shit that we have to do.
[319:28.22]I have to fill time.
[319:29.16]Start turning things off you aren't using.
[319:31.98]What?
[319:32.30]What do you mean turn things off that I'm not?
[319:36.26]That's how this works?
[319:42.73]Oh my god.
[319:43.89]Yo, teach, when is it lunch?
[319:49.68]I agree with this one.
[319:56.74]This was actually a terrible stream.
[319:58.35]Oh, have a nice day!
[319:59.65]King of Retail.
[320:00.99]King of Retail.
[320:02.59]Logos.
[320:03.49]Jerma Suss.
[320:05.41]Fatal error.
[320:06.29]The game has crashed.
[320:07.27]What the fuck?
[320:08.37]Stand and face the wall until a customer comes in.
[320:20.31]Okay.
[320:22.38]Let's find out what the worst stream of the year was.
[320:24.90]Here we go.
[320:28.86]Your least favorite stream of the year... is going to...
[320:50.50]Of the whole year.
[320:59.48]Smite.
[321:00.98]With 35% of the vote.
[321:03.46]And then YouTuber's Life with 25% and then King of Retail with 12%.
[321:09.45]Smite was the worst stream of the year, apparently.
[321:15.79]By a lot.
[321:18.73]Which is fine, because I know that, like, people don't like MOBAs.
[321:22.73]They fucking hate those games.
[321:24.80]MOBAs suck, dude.
[321:26.08]They're fucking boring, and I sucked at the game.
[321:28.38]I think I killed one person.
[321:31.62]Smite Sunday canceled forever.
[321:35.48]Shit.
[321:38.40]Smite was the worst stream of the year.
[321:41.78]Okay.
[321:44.46]I'm gonna take a few seconds with this one.
[321:50.03]This is the best stream of the year.
[321:52.95]Dollhouse is not on this list because Dollhouse was excluded from this list.
[321:59.41]I didn't want there to be just Dollhouse, Dollhouse, Dollhouse, Dollhouse, Dollhouse, as much as it was one of my favorite experiences ever.
[322:07.68]We've got to give opportunity to other people and other streams.
[322:12.10]So this is the final category.
[322:16.55]This is the nominees for the best stream of the whole year.
[322:21.96]Besides Dollhouse.
[322:26.26]I wonder what this category looks like next year.
[322:30.60]Because I'm going to be really, really emotional and real with you.
[322:34.03]There's a lot of shit that I'm going to do in 2022.
[322:38.51]I don't even know how we do this in 2022.
[322:44.44]I think a lot of stuff is going to be really fun.
[322:47.96]I hope so.
[322:52.18]If I can keep going, if people still think that this stream is worth watching, I hope I can make you happy.
[323:01.81]I hope so.
[323:04.29]There are 27,000 people here watching at like 1 o'clock in the morning Pacific.
[323:08.38]I can't believe you're fucking here.
[323:12.68]I hope I can continue to do the things that you enjoy.
[323:16.24]I really do.
[323:20.68]I'm gonna try.
[323:21.25]That's all I can tell you.
[323:26.27]Some of them might be- I might swing and I might miss and it might be a strikeout, right?
[323:31.85]But I promise you something.
[323:33.59]One thing really important.
[323:35.67]I promise.
[323:37.77]I will try to make streams that I think are fun to watch.
[323:43.65]Will that happen?
[323:44.69]We'll find out.
[323:45.41]We'll see.
[323:47.87]I don't know.
[323:49.82]But there's a lot of crazy shit that hopefully you see in the next month or two.
[324:01.28]Here are the nominees for Best Stream of the Year.
[324:04.98]Besides Snow House!
[324:21.46]No!
[324:28.85]Oh, god damn it!
[324:30.15]What?
[324:30.89]This is it.
[324:41.25]Why would you ever get this close?
[324:42.97]Of course.
[324:51.99]Shoot!
[324:52.49]Am I supposed to be sitting down?
[324:59.73]Oh shit!
[325:01.05]Grab the pistol and shoot.
[325:02.73]Who?
[325:03.05]You?
[325:18.41]It's in this area here.
[325:36.58]I'm gonna find that goddamn treasure and I'll be the first one.
[325:40.50]Collectible monster card packs, holy shit.
[325:43.40]Pokémon!
[325:46.31]Cards!
[325:48.68]What is this?
[325:51.98]What is Grotto Beasts?
[325:53.30]So those are really clear quartz crystals, which tells us that that's a really pure mineral.
[325:57.84]So that's why you're getting kind of that glassy appearance of them.
[326:00.26]That looks incredible.
[326:01.50]What's in there?
[326:03.49]I'm not sure.
[326:05.55]Oh my god!
[326:06.07]It's Minecraft diamonds!
[326:08.45]Come on!
[326:08.87]71 million of spin!
[326:17.75]And that's a coin.
[326:28.21]That's 3.1 million limes.
[326:29.67]Hey, get yourself some nice five more limes.
[326:39.70]Listen, here's another 2,500.
[326:42.44]I'm going to give you another $2,500.
[326:43.36]Don't buy any more limes, please.
[326:44.94]What did you say?
[326:46.04]Buy limes at market value?
[326:48.87]Where am I?
[326:55.27]I need to wink into the spirit.
[326:57.63]Why?
[327:00.54]Ow, my head.
[327:01.04]My brain just hurt.
[327:02.08]I'm getting this strong, incredible urge to receive donations and subscriptions.
[327:11.14]I don't even know what that means.
[327:17.32]It got in the eye again.
[327:19.93]How?
[327:20.41]How did that happen twice?
[327:23.35]Spraying in the tub, in the tub, in the tub, inside.
[327:28.01]How did it happen twice?
[327:33.09]The character's fucking... That character... That character's like, why am I supposed to... What?
[327:39.25]The character... That character's like, why am I supposed to... Fuck.
[327:49.44]I can't.
[327:49.88]I can't.
[327:53.36]Alright.
[327:54.06]Alright.
[327:54.72]Okay.
[327:55.58]Okay.
[327:55.98]Got 73.
[328:01.29]She's got her hair tied up in braids I pressed the gas way too hard.
[328:06.25]I don't think Chewie can't use powers
[328:34.20]If I... Oh, shit.
[328:41.48]It's... Wait, he's blocking?
[328:44.99]He ate him.
[328:46.91]What?
[328:56.02]Alright, see you later.
[329:01.68]Have fun.
[329:02.26]Thanks for coming.
[329:06.06]Holy shit.
[329:10.93]Hold on, wait.
[329:17.53]Oh my god!
[329:18.79]What the f- What the fuck?
[329:21.03]Excuse me?
[329:21.85]Um, excuse me.
[329:26.34]Why is there a big shit log on the ground?
[329:28.68]It's so close.
[329:31.25]One or two more pushes.
[329:32.09]This should be it.
[329:32.79]Got it.
[329:34.03]Game over.
[329:35.29]This is so weird.
[329:38.32]It's a wicked shitty skeleton.
[329:39.96]Just push it.
[329:42.18]It's so fragile.
[329:44.06]You're not going to fall in the acid, are you?
[329:53.27]I'll get the luggage.
[329:56.25]We're on x2 speed?
[329:57.63]Wait, why'd she do that?
[330:25.87]I'm not just saying that because we're playing Resident Evil.
[330:27.95]He really was a tyrant.
[330:28.79]He was a terrible guy.
[330:29.47]We're not gonna use this anywhere, right?
[330:38.09]Are you gonna make sure nobody can hear me?
[330:40.88]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[330:53.54]Mama.
[330:54.28]Yeah, I agree.
[330:56.23]Mama.
[330:57.47]Oh, he got me.
[331:00.05]Oh, my God.
[331:03.33]Hey.
[331:04.35]I don't think I will.
[331:11.92]I don't think I will drop the scissors.
[331:13.46]I just blew it.
[331:16.02]I got too close.
[331:16.51]I was talking.
[331:30.14]I'm gonna get you!
[331:51.04]You know, every year that we've done this, I've sat here going, there ain't no fucking way it's that much fun next year.
[332:01.05]And every year, it seems to get even more fun for me.
[332:10.68]I hope that continues.
[332:13.64]I told you guys a long time ago, when this is not fun for me anymore, I'm going to stop.
[332:21.35]That has not happened yet.
[332:23.97]Uh, but, same thing like last year, I'm sitting here going, am I gonna have this, are we gonna have this much fun next year?
[332:30.99]I hope we can.
[332:34.03]Um, but this is four years in a row.
[332:38.47]And I don't take this shit for granted at all.
[332:42.36]We've seen a lot of new people this year in particular, and I'll put the same message forward to those people that I did last year.
[332:49.32]And that's
[332:51.81]I don't really try to do anything else here besides have fun.
[332:56.03]If that continues, great.
[332:58.84]Please let me know if it doesn't.
[333:01.80]Please.
[333:03.46]I hope you let me know if I fuck up.
[333:08.30]And this is not a fun fucking place anymore.
[333:11.97]I mean it.
[333:12.29]Because that's all I really want to do.
[333:17.85]So let's find out.
[333:20.66]What was the best stream of last year?
[333:22.88]Or this year, right?
[333:27.37]What do you think?
[333:33.97]Besides Dollhouse, ladies and gentlemen, the winner... It was close.
[333:39.51]Closer than I thought because one of them was a big event.
[333:45.95]With 25% of the vote...
[333:50.32]The archaeology stream is your winner.
[333:54.47]Right behind it at 22% was Wrestling Empire.
[333:59.93]That was very close.
[334:02.69]Bugleberry's Cauldron was underneath that at 10%.
[334:07.94]But the archaeology stream takes it.
[334:10.88]Besides Dollhouse, obviously right.
[334:13.54]But I still can't fucking believe I'm sitting here right now.
[334:20.28]Um, I hope this next 2022 is as fun as I had this year.
[334:27.50]I hope so.
[334:30.64]I'm going to try to do more fun stuff.
[334:33.06]I don't know how good it's going to be, but we'll find out.
[334:37.30]Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not going to get all sappy.
[334:43.33]I won't get emotional.
[334:44.33]I'm not going to get sappy.
[334:45.11]People saying cry.
[334:49.81]If you're going to stick around for next year, if you're going to stick around on the channel, thanks.
[334:55.95]That's all I can say.
[334:58.88]There's nothing else I can really tell you besides thanks for watching.
[335:05.98]It's so much fun to do this every year.
[335:07.64]It's so much fun to stream.
[335:10.76]Let's keep going to 2022.
[335:16.96]I have so much fun with this community.
[335:20.89]You guys do such wild shit.
[335:24.15]I have bad days, right?
[335:25.47]I have bad days and I have good days.
[335:27.47]Just like everybody else does.
[335:29.83]But as a whole, holy fucking moly.
[335:33.59]This is one of the funniest goddamn places I've ever been.
[335:38.11]And I cherish it every single fucking day.
[335:42.07]Just be aware of that.
[335:45.25]So, it is time... It is time...
[335:50.56]Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the Rumble.
[335:54.04]The 2021 Rumble.
[335:55.42]We're going to end on this.
[335:58.92]I'm very excited.
[336:02.13]We had some really fucked up matches.
[336:03.79]A couple of them got a little bugged out, but it's okay.
[336:12.51]Here we go.
[336:14.13]Are you ready?
[336:16.43]The Rumble to end the stream tonight.
[336:22.06]Here we go.
[336:32.85]I don't hear any sounds.
[336:35.23]Oh, I don't hear any sounds because I turned the volume down.
[336:37.67]Hold on.
[336:37.95]Let me fix it.
[336:44.33]Why can't I hear it?
[336:44.97]There we go.
[336:49.33]Your first contestant in the Jerma Rumble 2021.
[336:51.89]Hopefully it doesn't crash or bug out.
[336:57.00]30 contestants.
[336:58.28]Only one can remain.
[336:58.82]Very late 1 a.m.
[336:59.32]Pacific time, but we're going for it.
[337:15.21]That doesn't really work here.
[337:23.68]We just kind of have people fight in a ring.
[337:25.08]It's a very polite crowd.
[337:28.30]Oh no, Bugleberry.
[337:32.93]Hot Tub Bugleberry is number one.
[337:35.11]That sucks.
[337:38.01]Unfortunate for Bugleberry.
[337:39.65]I don't think he's going to make it very far.
[337:45.80]1 and 2 usually are guaranteed to lose in the first 10 seconds.
[337:50.71]10 minutes.
[337:58.43]B.F. Bugleberry.
[338:01.67]From New York.
[338:03.63]Right.
[338:08.05]I wonder who's 2 though.
[338:09.17]I don't know.
[338:09.59]These are all random.
[338:13.52]He's an EU streamer now?
[338:19.04]The next contestant is going to be none other than... Who is it?
[338:28.14]Who is number two?
[338:29.10]Oh, that's Joe Biden!
[338:31.44]That's Joe Bionicle Biden!
[338:36.16]He's guaranteed to lose!
[338:44.39]Coming in his suit, but I know for a fact he's got a Bionicle t-shirt on underneath that.
[338:50.32]I'm pretty certain of that.
[338:51.64]We'll see Joe Bionicle Biden here.
[338:54.60]With B.F. Bugleberry.
[338:58.20]Two unfortunate souls.
[339:03.04]He's waving the American flag.
[339:04.70]Okay.
[339:09.52]Just wait till you see the shirt.
[339:12.46]It's really him.
[339:13.26]He's here in the ring right now.
[339:14.60]B.F. Bugleberry, Joe Biden.
[339:19.12]Welcome to the 2021 Rumble, Jerma Rumble, ladies and gentlemen.
[339:22.49]Joe Bionicle Biden versus B.F. Bugleberry, hot tub version.
[339:27.47]Thanks for staying up late with me here.
[339:28.59]It's been a wild night.
[339:32.71]A lot of interesting stuff going on.
[339:35.49]As B.F. Bugleberry, will he remove Joe Bionicle Biden?
[339:39.80]He's gone.
[339:40.84]He's gone.
[339:42.51]He's gone.
[339:44.19]So I'm glad you got to see this shirt for five seconds.
[339:48.95]In comes the sunflower.
[339:50.59]Jerma's sunflower from the summertime.
[339:53.88]As contestant number three.
[339:57.76]Really took care of those sunflowers.
[340:00.38]Loved them.
[340:01.18]Cared for them.
[340:03.12]So it's B.F. Bugleberry and the sunflower.
[340:08.56]One elimination for Bugleberry so far.
[340:12.59]Big reversal by the Sunflower though.
[340:14.05]Look at those wings.
[340:16.27]Already another coming in the ring.
[340:18.07]We're just going crazy right now.
[340:19.67]We're going forward in five seconds.
[340:21.94]Three, two, one.
[340:26.46]Don't look at it.
[340:27.84]Just know it's in the ring.
[340:30.18]Our fourth contestant is the Horror.
[340:34.20]Heap the Horror is number four.
[340:37.42]As B.F. Bugleberry and the Sunflower are trading blows here.
[340:40.74]While the Horror just kind of sits and is just gauging the scene to see how it is.
[340:47.32]I'd love to see the Sunflower last a little while here.
[340:52.67]Another, it's immediately, they're coming in hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
[340:59.02]We're going to have four people in the ring in no time here.
[341:02.66]Here comes Amelia from the dollhouse.
[341:07.14]Amelia coming in at number five.
[341:11.96]Which rounds us out here.
[341:13.82]We got five people in the ring.
[341:15.32]Amelia, Sunflower, BF, Bugleberry, and the Horror.
[341:19.99]Hopefully nobody died.
[341:21.49]And Amelia going right for the Sunflower.
[341:23.33]Trying to get eliminated immediately.
[341:26.19]No, just barely holds on for dear life as the sunflower.
[341:29.85]Another contestant coming in.
[341:33.90]I said five, there are four.
[341:35.66]I'm, my brain is slow.
[341:37.82]I'm sorry.
[341:39.84]And that's SillyZillyGwonka from the Chocolatier stream.
[341:44.26]Filling the ring up.
[341:46.10]The more people, the better, obviously.
[341:48.08]There's SillyZillyGwonka.
[341:53.35]Ended up making about four or five billion dollars trading chocolate.
[341:59.19]Lots of money.
[342:00.37]SillyZillyWonka, welcome first appearance in the Rumble.
[342:02.97]How are you?
[342:03.77]Good to see you.
[342:04.29]PeepTheHorror going over the ropes.
[342:05.54]No!
[342:05.90]Sunflower!
[342:08.40]Ah, we might see a removal of the Sunflower.
[342:10.08]No!
[342:12.36]SillyZillyWonka almost going over the top ropes while TheHorror barely and CatboyJerma coming in at number seven.
[342:20.42]PeepTheHorror swinging at absolutely nobody.
[342:23.76]As Catboy Jerma comes in.
[342:26.16]A fan favorite.
[342:28.32]Not a great place to come into the Rumble at number seven.
[342:31.04]You really want to come in at least at 15.
[342:33.36]Sunflower getting pushed over by B.F. Bugle.
[342:35.62]Hot tub Bugleberry.
[342:38.56]Oh, there it goes.
[342:41.12]That's the second elimination from B.F. Bugleberry.
[342:43.90]Hot tub version.
[342:46.82]Really had high hopes for the Sunflower.
[342:50.29]Sunflower is now eliminated, and now here comes Chris Banana Redfield.
[342:55.17]At number eight, we saw Chris Redfield win the match previously with Lady Dimitrisou.
[343:02.28]Tag team win here.
[343:03.72]Trying to come in and stake his victory, stake his claim to the Jerma985 Rumble Throne, potentially.
[343:15.67]Oh, Emilia out, eliminated with a big punch by Silly Zilly Wonka.
[343:21.37]That did not take very much time at all as Chris Redfield grabs B.F. Bugleberry.
[343:25.40]Belly to belly suplex.
[343:28.08]Our next contestant coming in now is Armin from Attack on Titan.
[343:32.02]Aaron!
[343:33.24]Aaron!
[343:35.12]Last time you'll hear that ever.
[343:38.43]As Silly Zilly Wonka going over the top ropes by Catboy and the Horror.
[343:45.79]Bugleberry still safe.
[343:50.52]are still safe although maybe not for long as Chris Redfield trying to dump him over the top ropes very strong character is Chris banana Redfield but catboy now they're double teaming B.F. Bugleberry together trying to eliminate him will they get it no they will not and here comes jex fan favorite
[344:15.91]Rumble favorite.
[344:17.27]Number 10.
[344:18.75]Jex is in the building ready to cause havoc and mayhem and show his gamer skills by potentially dumping Bugaberry.
[344:27.17]Not over the top ropes.
[344:30.29]Simply smushing his neck.
[344:32.71]And there goes the horror.
[344:33.81]Chris Redfield eliminated the horror with a big right hand.
[344:40.79]And taunting in the middle of the ring.
[344:44.68]As Jex is recovering, just barely getting in the ring.
[344:47.62]And here comes Joel from Vinesauce.
[344:50.86]Was supposed to be in the Rumble last year, but I fucked it up.
[344:54.82]So here comes Joel for the first time ever.
[344:57.24]From Vine Wrestle.
[345:01.50]And there goes Bugleberry.
[345:03.50]Bugleberry is out.
[345:05.31]Eliminated.
[345:07.51]First contestant.
[345:08.49]It sucks.
[345:09.41]It's too bad.
[345:10.15]There goes Hot Tub Bugleberry.
[345:18.74]Almost at number 12, I think 11.
[345:23.65]Armin's still in the ring.
[345:26.47]And representing the Grotto Beasts.
[345:29.41]Introducing Meowdy.
[345:34.19]Still, where is Meowdy?
[345:36.51]Why is Meowdy not in the ring?
[345:37.99]Okay, it took you a little longer.
[345:40.81]Representing Grotto Beasts is Meowdy.
[345:45.35]If Meowdy eliminates Jex, they're the favorite.
[345:48.31]Jex is 100 stats.
[345:51.05]Let's be very clear about this.
[345:56.49]Big suplex from Armin on Joel.
[345:59.27]As Meowdy can... I don't know what Meowdy's doing.
[346:03.04]I would say top seed.
[346:06.70]Three cat people are in the ring right now.
[346:08.70]Homer, Simpson, all of you are looking for Homer.
[346:11.62]You finally got your Homer Simpson.
[346:13.56]Was not going to put Homer in a match, but there they are.
[346:15.90]Homer Simpson.
[346:22.05]Picking up Joel and doing a suplex to Joel.
[346:26.91]Swinging belly to back suplex.
[346:28.33]But Chris Redfield now.
[346:29.69]I kind of have high hopes for Chris Redfield.
[346:34.28]I say that until... Oh, please don't do it, Homer.
[346:37.98]Homer Simpson now is threatening to throw Chris Redfield over the top ropes.
[346:42.73]Looks like they might get it.
[346:45.91]And here comes tier list Andy.
[346:50.21]Oh, shit.
[346:50.95]He actually did it.
[346:51.99]No.
[346:54.46]Tier list Andy is just a tier list.
[346:57.70]As Homer Simpson just absolutely decimates Chris Banana Redfield.
[347:02.28]Really sad stuff that we're seeing here.
[347:06.28]What tier list is on tier list, Andy?
[347:09.56]I don't know.
[347:11.10]It's hard to tell.
[347:13.32]I don't know.
[347:13.76]What is on his back?
[347:16.73]As Meowdy eliminates Catboy.
[347:18.67]Jerma Cat eliminates Cat.
[347:22.09]Who could see that coming from a while away?
[347:24.25]I don't know.
[347:24.81]Catboy gone.
[347:26.81]Meowdy eliminates Catboy.
[347:30.96]When I told you top seed, I meant it.
[347:32.86]I was not messing around.
[347:33.96]I really meant it.
[347:38.74]As Homer Simpson now in the corner.
[347:41.10]Jex gets Armin.
[347:44.90]Armin is, I think from the last match, really kind of got annoyed at me talking about how shitty he was.
[347:49.60]And how not strong that Armin was.
[347:53.93]Trying to go for Jex, which is a huge mistake.
[347:58.23]You don't go for Jex, in quotes.
[348:00.79]That's how you die.
[348:03.83]As Meowdy and Homer Simpson with tier list Andy in the mix as well.
[348:07.69]Joel from Vinesauce also is there.
[348:10.32]Still fighting for his life.
[348:12.48]Against Tier List Andy.
[348:15.66]If Homer Simpson wins the Rumble, I will eat glass on stream.
[348:19.72]Make that clear.
[348:21.32]There's no fucking way.
[348:29.47]As Meowty now is over on the right side.
[348:36.85]Who's the next competitor?
[348:38.02]It's Mr. Green.
[348:40.24]Or Mr. Greens, depending on who you are.
[348:42.34]You can say whatever you want.
[348:46.44]Here's Mr. Greens.
[348:47.24]He's in the last rumble.
[348:48.60]Making his second or third appearance in the Jerma Rumble here.
[348:52.38]Going right for Armin.
[348:53.84]Armin now over the top ropes.
[348:55.30]Might.
[348:55.80]Oh, there goes Jax.
[348:56.69]Meowty is top seed.
[348:58.85]I would be terrified of Meowty right now.
[349:01.18]Homer Simpson and Mr. Green trying to get Armin out.
[349:03.72]We will never hear Aaron again.
[349:05.70]Hopefully, thank God, we'll never hear it again.
[349:10.60]Armin has been eliminated by Homer Simpson and Mr. Green.
[349:14.98]As Josh from Science Center, Nevada.
[349:18.58]Science Josh making his first appearance in the Jerma Rumble.
[349:23.04]There he is, the archaeologist, geologist, whatever.
[349:26.34]I'm sorry.
[349:27.84]Science Center Josh making his appearance.
[349:30.95]As Armin is really slowly getting up here.
[349:33.45]Hopefully not injured.
[349:36.87]Mr. Homer missed completely.
[349:40.60]Science Center, Nevada.
[349:41.88]Josh just power bombed Joel outside the ring.
[349:44.90]There goes Joel.
[349:47.82]Joel has been eliminated from the Jerma Rumble.
[349:51.52]Sorry, Joel.
[349:52.98]It's been a pleasure to have you.
[349:56.06]But good luck next time.
[349:59.52]Please someone kill Homer Simpson so I don't have to eat glass.
[350:03.36]Please someone get rid of it.
[350:07.70]Meowdy will take care of it.
[350:09.02]I'm certain of it.
[350:09.74]Meowdy's gonna be fine.
[350:14.36]Science Josh is on the ropes here.
[350:16.44]Homer Simpson now with tier list Andy.
[350:18.56]Meowdy looking for their, I think, fifth or sixth elimination.
[350:22.25]No, don't powerbomb Josh out.
[350:24.43]Oh, fuck.
[350:26.28]Homer Simpson powerbombs Science Center Josh.
[350:29.22]Outside the ring, but Torgo making their appearance.
[350:32.00]Coming in hot.
[350:35.54]Here comes Torgo.
[350:36.32]High hopes for Torgo.
[350:43.37]From Mano's hands of fate.
[350:44.89]Mr. Green now looking at Homer Simpson trying to get him out of here.
[350:51.05]I hope we see it.
[350:52.17]Please get rid of Homer.
[350:54.73]Homer cannot win.
[350:57.28]It can't happen.
[351:00.40]Where's the music?
[351:01.12]Somebody just grab the ropes and dump them over.
[351:03.09]Oh, my God.
[351:03.99]The McGriddler at number 18 coming in.
[351:10.43]Saw the McGriddler earlier.
[351:12.39]But I would love to see a few eliminations from the McGriddler.
[351:16.02]Meowdy in trouble with the tier list now.
[351:23.12]Is it possible we could see a Meowdy elimination...
[351:27.40]No, not yet.
[351:32.19]As Torgo now has Homer, get rid of Homer now.
[351:36.49]Use that fucked up cane that you have.
[351:40.15]No!
[351:40.67]What?
[351:42.25]Oh my goodness.
[351:43.20]The sus guy coming in, but who cares?
[351:45.98]Naughty is out.
[351:48.22]That's really sad.
[351:51.36]Here comes the sus guy.
[351:58.19]This is not Sus Flush, this is the Sus Guy, different.
[352:06.39]I will take the Sus Guy winning over Homer Simpson, I swear to God.
[352:10.74]Sorry, Meowdy, that's very unfortunate.
[352:14.46]I would have liked to see Meowdy go all the way.
[352:16.24]At least the top five.
[352:19.92]Here comes Jermadillo, a BTTV emote.
[352:26.05]We'll probably see it a few times.
[352:30.91]Oh my god.
[352:33.84]Who just got thrown out?
[352:34.80]What?
[352:35.62]What happened?
[352:36.08]Who got eliminated?
[352:36.88]What happened?
[352:38.52]Oh, Mr. Green is gone.
[352:42.32]Jermodillo, I will literally make you a real emote if you get rid of Homer Simpson right now.
[352:49.04]Oh, two back-to-back eliminations.
[352:51.49]Who was that?
[352:52.79]The sus guy.
[352:54.82]And Tier List Andy.
[352:57.68]I'm not kidding.
[352:58.53]I will make Jermadillo a paid emote if he eliminates Homer Simpson.
[353:06.59]Sasuke and Tier List Andy both gone.
[353:16.30]Getting down to the final, I believe 12 competitors in this rumble.
[353:24.22]Homer Simpson still in it.
[353:28.32]Torgo now and Dermodillo.
[353:31.60]Please, Mick Riddler, get rid of him.
[353:34.81]Do not let Homer Simpson win.
[353:38.87]Let's see.
[353:39.43]A double elimination.
[353:40.61]It's possible, although I don't know how probable.
[353:42.69]There goes.
[353:43.45]No, he saved it.
[353:44.67]Still held on.
[353:46.85]William Karslok.
[353:49.45]I'm sure a bunch of people are probably saying, who right now?
[353:52.19]That's fine.
[353:52.71]Because that's the battleship captain from the battleship meta.
[353:57.44]That is the battleship captain.
[354:02.68]He's got a name, you know.
[354:07.60]Going right for the McGriddler.
[354:10.16]The failed meta.
[354:11.28]That meta was fine for like a week.
[354:13.75]It was like two or three weeks.
[354:14.63]Give me a break.
[354:16.51]This is a real guy?
[354:20.39]Is it a real guy?
[354:21.19]I don't know.
[354:23.87]Number 22 coming in.
[354:24.89]Dollhouse Jerma.
[354:29.11]No, don't.
[354:31.43]No.
[354:35.70]Fuck.
[354:37.46]Please.
[354:42.00]Get rid of Homer Simpson.
[354:45.80]As the Vic Gridler gets him in the top.
[354:47.18]He's on the turnbuckle.
[354:48.10]This is a really bad spot to be for Homer.
[354:53.39]Help him.
[354:53.97]Go help him, William Karslok.
[354:55.89]Whatever your goddamn name is.
[354:58.15]Real historical Andy.
[355:00.37]Oh, wait.
[355:00.75]Oh, wait.
[355:01.54]No.
[355:02.82]It's Spamton.
[355:04.58]From Deltarune Chapter 2, Spamton has joined the Rumble for the first time ever.
[355:12.56]I thought he threw him out immediately.
[355:19.02]Spampton, welcome everybody.
[355:21.24]Spampton.
[355:24.14]Homer Simpson is still in this rumble as William Carslock really trying to just, trying to find out, is he C3?
[355:30.99]Is he D5?
[355:31.55]I just don't know where Homer's battleship is.
[355:33.93]He's really trying to find it.
[355:35.89]Didn't find it, unfortunately.
[355:37.02]And here comes Fish Bastard at number 24.
[355:43.63]From the hot tub stream.
[355:45.71]One of Bugleberry's many disgusting, absurd, horrific creations.
[355:52.12]Of all the things, it looks like the McRiddler is going to have to deal with the fish bastard one-on-one here.
[356:00.08]Will the fish bastard take out the McRiddler?
[356:04.99]With the help of Spamton, this is potentially a newfound alliance we're seeing here.
[356:13.99]Werner Von Braun is the ooh-ah-hoo-ooh guy.
[356:17.91]There goes Torgo by Homer Simpson.
[356:19.87]Ooh-ah-hoo-ooh makes out number 24.
[356:28.23]Second Simpsons character, that's right.
[356:30.45]So if there's somebody to eliminate Homer Simpson, it's definitely him.
[356:35.67]Torgo, I don't think you'll be in the next Rumble, but it was really nice to have you.
[356:41.42]Thanks for coming.
[356:45.14]Spamton Fish Bastard, McGriddler, and Werner Von Braun.
[356:51.46]No, just barely hangs on is the McGriddler.
[356:54.64]While Dollhouse Jerma is still fighting the Battleship Captain, which is strange because, I mean, that's his meta.
[357:00.71]He created that meta.
[357:02.11]That's just like, that's his meta.
[357:04.35]It's weird that he'd be fighting against that meta.
[357:07.42]I mean, you could argue that Ludwig and others made that meta happen because Jerma's an irrelevant Andy and really didn't have much pull at all, but just decided to ask a relevant person.
[357:17.27]And he's gone.
[357:17.67]Jerma's gone.
[357:18.18]Fuck him.
[357:18.46]Who cares?
[357:22.76]Who gives a shit about that guy?
[357:33.56]Well, there goes Dollhouse Jerma.
[357:36.24]I don't think Jerma's ever going to win a competition.
[357:39.72]Why would he?
[357:45.08]Big, big... What's that called?
[357:47.33]The Gold Rush?
[357:48.69]I don't know.
[357:49.49]Whatever the guy's name is.
[357:50.57]Goldman?
[357:51.25]What's the guy's name?
[357:52.25]Goldberg.
[357:53.59]Big Goldberg jackhammer on Homer Simpson.
[357:57.75]Has the battleship captain really taken it to Homer Simpson now here?
[358:00.67]This would be a real big relief for me.
[358:03.44]There he goes.
[358:04.66]Goodbye Homer Simpson.
[358:05.82]Goodbye Spampton.
[358:07.80]Paddle Ship Captain and eliminate finally Homer Simpson.
[358:12.93]Thank God.
[358:14.91]Here comes Anubis from Smite.
[358:19.05]Getting us to 26 characters.
[358:24.29]Saw Anubis earlier in the evening.
[358:27.51]I don't have to eat glass anymore.
[358:29.07]Good.
[358:35.81]Somebody in this ring could be your 2021 champion of this.
[358:41.09]And there goes Mick Riddler.
[358:44.49]I'm sad about that.
[358:45.47]I think a lot of other people might be too.
[358:48.54]I'm not happy about what I just saw.
[358:50.24]That's sad.
[358:52.88]I was rooting for the Mick Riddler the whole time.
[358:57.76]Still four contestants that have yet to come out.
[359:02.48]It's all random, by the way.
[359:03.90]I have no control over any of the things you're seeing on screen.
[359:08.00]I just put them into the rumble.
[359:12.06]Fish bastard down.
[359:13.02]No, just going for a taunt.
[359:14.82]Stupid move.
[359:16.37]Cocky.
[359:17.79]Dumb.
[359:20.73]Will you put him down?
[359:25.89]It's his year.
[359:26.73]Well...
[359:29.72]It very well could be considering that Glue Man is number 27 in the Rumble 2021.
[359:36.10]Great opportunity for Glue Man.
[359:38.42]Is it Glue Man's year this year?
[359:41.28]Will we see a Glue Man victory for the first time in almost seven years?
[359:48.63]That's to be determined.
[359:54.61]I don't want to get my hopes up, but this could be Glue Man's year.
[360:02.69]27, welcome back, Blue Man, for the seventh or eighth annual time.
[360:06.32]I hope, oh, that gets tricky here.
[360:10.74]Wait till you get Mr. Satan comes in.
[360:14.12]From Wrestling Empire, Mr. Satan is now in the ring.
[360:20.56]Not only has experience in wrestling, but also has experience being the strongest man in the United States.
[360:26.71]Or whatever, it doesn't matter.
[360:29.46]Oh boy.
[360:31.27]That's bad.
[360:34.13]Mr. Satan eliminates.
[360:38.99]We are about to see the final two competitors in this rumble.
[360:42.55]Who will they be?
[360:45.74]Cromwell.
[360:47.46]The guardian praying mantis.
[360:50.60]At number 29.
[360:51.70]It's a great place to come in.
[360:54.50]He might be small.
[360:56.17]But praying mantis eat each other.
[360:58.71]And they kill each other.
[361:00.73]And pound for pound, he could pick up two fucking Mack trucks.
[361:07.52]Cromwell.
[361:08.52]Welcome to the Jerma Rumble.
[361:11.34]As Mr. Satan with Anubis in the corner here.
[361:14.46]There goes Anubis.
[361:17.58]We are down to our final competitor of the year.
[361:21.76]And it's the La La Dog.
[361:23.76]Oh no.
[361:24.46]Oh no.
[361:26.64]The La La Dog.
[361:28.36]Is number 30.
[361:32.12]Battleship Captain.
[361:33.22]Cromwell the Praying Mantis Guardian.
[361:35.26]The La La Dog.
[361:36.22]Fish Bastard.
[361:36.96]Glue Man.
[361:38.34]And the game crashed.
[361:48.38]Okay.
[361:49.81]So.
[361:51.35]What we're going to do.
[361:54.99]What we're going to do.
[361:58.87]is we're gonna do a five-man brawl with who is in the ring right there.
[362:05.27]Okay.
[362:06.11]Excellent.
[362:08.38]This fucking game sucks.
[362:14.70]We're just gonna do a-a over-the-top rope rumble.
[362:21.44]You crash right there at the- right at that moment, 2k.
[362:31.34]Alright, let's get it going.
[362:34.58]Let me make sure I get the right people in there.
[362:43.93]How many were in there?
[362:44.65]That was Cromwell?
[362:49.10]I think it was five or six, right?
[362:54.80]Five.
[363:01.26]It was the final five.
[363:04.10]Homer was not in it.
[363:06.14]Who was in it?
[363:08.36]Homer was not there.
[363:09.18]It was Cromwell?
[363:12.11]You fucking goddamn game.
[363:13.87]I swear to God.
[363:19.49]Yep.
[363:19.73]Glue Man was there.
[363:20.45]Okay.
[363:26.04]Homer was not there.
[363:27.16]I'm not going to add Homer.
[363:31.64]Anubis just got eliminated right there.
[363:35.67]Yep.
[363:36.05]The battleship captain.
[363:36.97]Thank you.
[363:43.21]What a buzzkill.
[363:44.09]Seriously.
[363:44.51]Alright.
[363:47.10]Who else?
[363:48.34]Mr. Satan.
[363:48.96]That's right.
[363:55.50]What a buzzkill.
[363:55.96]What a buzzkill.
[364:00.10]The final five, you're gonna crash.
[364:01.74]Why?
[364:02.16]Because the Lala dog went up on the top rope and did a taunt?
[364:07.64]I'm gonna hold my tongue.
[364:11.45]Yeah, the Lala dog.
[364:12.89]Who was the final person?
[364:14.05]Oh my god, this is such a shitshow.
[364:16.79]And Fish Bastard.
[364:17.85]Really?
[364:20.84]Was that the final five?
[364:21.72]Okay, let's go.
[364:26.32]Fish Bastard.
[364:31.85]There were six?
[364:36.21]Oh, shit, you're right, there were six.
[364:40.78]Okay, hold on, I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta.
[364:51.10]Yep, you're right.
[364:51.66]Okay, so let me get this one more time.

[365:43.61]Cromwell, Fish Bastard, Battleship Captain, La La Dog, Glue Man.
[365:49.40]And who else?

[366:12.28]Here we go.
[366:23.42]Let's go, Glue Man.
[366:24.54]It could happen.
[366:25.56]I don't know how... I don't know if it will.
[366:30.26]It is so late, too.
[366:31.49]Thanks for staying up, everybody.
[366:36.26]I hope you had a good time.
[366:37.76]I've had a blast.
[366:38.64]I've been just having a fucking ball.
[366:41.00]Hopefully you have too.
[366:44.08]I love these streams.
[366:45.82]It's like a culmination of the whole year.
[366:47.32]I just have, I just, I might be a little tipsy right now, but thanks for sticking around.
[366:54.59]Let's see who the, let's crown the champion here.
[366:59.91]It's in the NXT arena.
[367:01.49]Who cares?
[367:02.33]Let's go.
[367:23.11]Is this Glue Man's year?
[367:28.79]We'll find out.
[367:30.73]The final five.
[367:33.09]Here we go.
[367:35.43]Mr. Satan.
[367:37.65]Glue Man.
[367:38.71]Battleship Captain.
[367:39.71]Fish Bastard.
[367:40.51]Cromwell.
[367:41.07]The Praying Mantis Guardian.
[367:42.91]And a La La Dog.
[367:45.79]Looks like we might see an immediate elimination in this final five.
[367:50.10]There goes Cromwell.
[367:53.21]Will this be the year of the Gloom Man?
[367:54.85]I've been doing this every year since like 2012.
[367:59.09]And Gloom Man has been there since the very beginning.
[368:03.47]Will we actually get a Gloom Man Jerma Rumble victory?
[368:12.65]I don't know.
[368:15.63]But we're down to the final five.
[368:20.22]Glue Man picking up the Lala dog.
[368:22.40]Looks like Lala could see the end here.
[368:25.72]Alright, final four.
[368:29.89]No!
[368:31.27]Fish Bastard has Glue Man up on the ropes.
[368:35.07]This is Glue Man's year.
[368:36.27]It can't be.
[368:39.07]Oh, Fish Bastard, like the worst character made in the cauldron.
[368:43.20]You can't eliminate Glue Man, thank goodness.
[368:48.77]the battleship captain has Glue Man now we have to see a momentum change here or this is a huge problem Mr. Satan fish bastard Glue Man's gotta get every need to give Glue Man our strength there goes fish bastard down to the final three Mr. Satan battleship captain and Glue Man
[369:17.14]I have no idea what's gonna happen, but I have an outcome that I want.
[369:21.04]I don't know if it's outcome we're gonna get.
[369:23.82]As Mr. Satan grabs Glue Man now by the wrist.
[369:28.14]Big reversal by Glue Man!
[369:35.47]No, no, you gotta reverse these, Glue Man!
[369:37.73]There it is!
[369:39.53]Big reversal!
[369:43.84]Oh, gets clotheslined for his effort.
[369:45.64]So much energy, so much effort from Glue Man.
[369:51.91]Slow to get up, though, which is bad, which means the fatigue is really high.
[369:58.15]As Mr. Satan goes into the ropes.
[369:59.89]Battleship captain.
[370:02.75]Holy shit.
[370:03.85]Mr. Satan.
[370:05.29]Nope.
[370:05.85]Double reversal here.
[370:08.79]A triple reversal.
[370:12.42]They're going to double team and get him over the ropes.
[370:17.53]Mr. Satan is about to eliminate the battleship captain.
[370:21.29]As Glue Man watches on.
[370:23.59]No.
[370:26.25]Still gaining some strength it seems.
[370:29.92]Big Russian sweep, whatever that's called.
[370:35.00]Oh no.
[370:36.84]Mr. Satan with the big double arm tiger suplex.
[370:41.91]You gotta be shitting me.
[370:43.05]Glue Man gonna go for a throw Mr. Satan over the top ropes?
[370:47.25]He's hungry this year.
[370:48.57]He's starving for it.
[370:50.95]No!
[370:52.93]It's not gonna be enough.
[370:58.20]He gets reversed.
[371:02.38]Don't be an idiot, Glue Man.
[371:04.28]No, he's getting too cocky.
[371:06.20]Oh, shit!
[371:10.49]You've been here for seven straight years, Glue Man.
[371:13.03]You can't just be cocky and go taunt.
[371:17.52]Mr. Satan.
[371:19.40]Big reversal though.
[371:20.52]Elbow to the face of Mr. Satan.
[371:24.56]I'm actually kind of nervous for Glue Man right now.
[371:26.50]This is kind of bad.
[371:33.81]Two belly-to-belly suplexes.
[371:35.29]Mr. Satan is stacked.
[371:40.60]Cleaning up the ring right now I'm surprised the battleship captain has lasted this long One of these three will be crowned champion of the rumble And we all know who we want it to be Go for it Glue Man stop being cocky go for it Cool
[372:10.78]You know, I think the problem is he's never had this much screen time before.
[372:14.81]He's milking the audience.
[372:18.85]And it's going to be his downfall.
[372:24.43]This is the most screen time he's ever had.
[372:29.43]He's hoping to get a book deal after this is over.
[372:33.76]Big belly to back suplex.
[372:37.17]Will the cockiness- Oh god, it's over.
[372:39.49]He's gone.
[372:51.09]Blue Man has been eliminated.
[372:52.79]See you later.
[372:54.83]That's very sad.
[372:58.15]Battleship Captain and Mr. Satan are the final two competitors this year.
[373:04.35]Better luck next year.
[373:05.71]Yeah.
[373:06.63]Unfortunate.
[373:09.75]The hubris.
[373:10.49]I know!
[373:11.01]What was he doing?
[373:11.59]He's like taunting.
[373:12.48]He's going on the top ropes.
[373:13.46]Like, get down, man.
[373:14.40]What's wrong with you?
[373:19.54]Rip, rip, rip.
[373:20.52]Yeah.
[373:21.48]Sad.
[373:23.06]You hate to see it.
[373:26.83]It looks like Mr. Satan is going... No, he's not.
[373:32.49]This would be quite an upset.
[373:34.31]If William Carslark, the battleship captain, wins the game.
[373:40.11]What an upset.
[373:45.88]Uh... I need to take it.
[374:00.80]I didn't think he was going to do it that quickly.
[374:10.12]He is the strongest man on Earth, so it makes sense, right?
[374:14.02]I'll tell you something, Goku.
[374:23.53]I am the strongest man on Earth.
[374:25.19]I'm the strongest man in wrestling.
[374:34.88]Mr. Satan is your 2021 Jerma Rumble champion.
[374:43.46]Mr. Satan.
[374:48.19]I'm not putting home.
[374:49.77]No, we got to go to bed.
[374:50.91]We got to get out of here.
[374:52.39]It's so late.
