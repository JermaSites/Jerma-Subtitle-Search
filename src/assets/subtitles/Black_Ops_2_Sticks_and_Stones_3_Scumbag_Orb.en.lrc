[00:01.31]Kind of a good game here.
[00:03.13]I'm a winner.
[00:04.70]Turning on the try hard power mode right now.
[00:06.46]Here we go.
[00:07.68]Looks like it's not going to be another W for Orb.
[00:11.06]Shut up.
[00:12.38]If you don't DDoS me this time, I'm going to win.
[00:16.26]Oh.
[00:17.10]What are you doing?
[00:17.76]I've got a Tomahawk with your own Tomahawk.
[00:20.21]Where did my Tomahawk even go?
[00:22.61]Shit.
[00:24.01]I hate you.
[00:25.41]Why did I even talk to you?
[00:26.93]You're an awful friend.
[00:28.87]You're throwing axes at me and shit.
[00:31.36]That's what I'm saying.
[00:32.64]It's not so much about winning games, it's about banking your friends.
[00:35.70]That's where the enjoyment comes from, the pleasure of this game.
[00:39.66]You're an awful friend.
[00:41.91]Who the hell is down here?
[00:46.87]Tomahawk.
[00:48.31]Oh my god, look at that game.
[00:49.49]Nope, I'm not watching it.
[00:50.95]Nope.
[00:51.93]Not even going to watch it.
[00:52.60]I'm going to skip it.
[00:53.38]I'm going to find you and stick a crossbow.
[00:55.52]I'm going to skip it.
[00:57.22]I'm going to skip it.
[00:59.93]Who's this guy?
[01:03.03]Damn it, oh man, Jesus, leave me alone.
[01:05.09]Why are you like shooting me up?
[01:08.61]I'm so lost right now, I don't even know where I am.
[01:11.97]I'm just like running around in a circle.
[01:14.96]Oh my god, what a shot.
[01:17.04]That guy hit me through this little thing here.
[01:20.32]I can't believe he hit that.
[01:21.60]I'm getting destroyed.
[01:22.28]There we go, this way.
[01:30.42]No!
[01:31.42]This guy... Get away from me.
[01:34.00]Rafe!
[01:34.80]Rafe!
[01:35.72]Somebody help!
[01:36.71]Oh, that's not me.
[01:37.31]I thought it was you, though.
[01:40.45]He was trying to back me.
[01:41.19]I saw it in his eyes.
[01:42.75]I saw the devil.
[01:44.27]I saw the devil when I looked in his eyes.
[01:47.61]Okay, come to Bitch Ramp.
[01:48.59]Do you know where Bitch Ramp is?
[01:51.25]I have no idea what that is.
[01:53.09]It's the only, like, big ramp that you can stand on.
[01:57.51]It's in the corner of the map.
[01:58.91]Alright, big ramp.
[02:00.40]Big ramp.
[02:00.96]It's the only ramp that you can stand on.
[02:04.82]Opposite from the Harriers.
[02:06.58]You know where the Harriers are placed?
[02:08.49]Let's come there and let's fight.
[02:09.95]Let's duel, okay?
[02:10.77]Let's set up a duel.
[02:11.47]I'm not going to kill you right away.
[02:12.35]Let's just set up a duel.
[02:13.31]I'm not going to kill you right away.
[02:15.11]Let's look at the confidence in this guy.
[02:16.48]We're going to have a duel.
[02:19.49]Come here quick before we die!
[02:20.97]Dude, this guy is shooting the hell out of me right now.
[02:23.27]I gotta like deal with this first.
[02:24.98]Do you know where the ramp is though?
[02:26.22]Yeah, I'm being like chased.
[02:27.86]On the right.
[02:28.46]On the right.
[02:29.62]We're teaming up!
[02:31.98]We can't win this.
[02:33.35]Oh, no!
[02:34.39]I didn't see him come up!
[02:35.93]You're a terrible Overwatch!
[02:39.09]Wow.
[02:40.27]I swear, I look great.
[02:41.57]We keep, must be keeping my back, yeah.
[02:43.37]Wait a second.
[02:44.31]Who's that?
[02:44.67]Is that?
[02:45.31]That's you.
[02:46.17]I ought to just throw this thing up your ass right now.
[02:48.59]Nope.
[02:49.59]So where's, is that?
[02:50.79]Nope.
[02:51.75]No, I died.
[02:53.50]Nowhere near where you got me.
[02:54.78]Okay, I see.
[02:56.22]I see how this moves.
[02:57.32]Okay, listen, we're even now.
[03:01.43]Okay, Jerobo, have you found the ramp?
[03:03.37]Oh, hi, that's you, that's you.
[03:04.77]Alright, so where are we going?
[03:06.95]Wait, what?
[03:07.61]What did you do that for?
[03:09.35]Oh, that was, oh!
[03:10.12]What are you doing?
[03:14.80]What?
[03:15.70]You said, follow me, and then you killed me.
[03:18.52]Okay, here we go.
[03:19.20]Everybody's here, everybody's here.
[03:20.66]Who, did you die?
[03:21.82]No, I ran away because I was getting attacked.
[03:24.91]I think there's a guy behind us right now.
[03:27.71]We're just gonna meet up there and have a duel, okay?
[03:32.15]All of us.
[03:32.75]I don't think that's gonna happen.
[03:34.09]These guys are just shooting the hell out of us.
[03:36.29]Okay, we just have to kill the right people.
[03:38.49]Look at their name tag before you kill them.
[03:40.69]That's quite difficult because they're shooting at you.
[03:43.11]Okay, I'm up here.
[03:43.91]I'm up here.
[03:44.29]Don't shoot.
[03:44.65]I see you right there.
[03:46.34]I just saw a Tomahawk go right by my face.
[03:48.96]Watch out for this guy.
[03:51.38]Watch out for this guy.
[03:53.14]Who's that?
[03:55.87]I got stuck from behind.
[03:56.95]I'm gonna bankrupt him.
[03:58.61]Oh, I missed.
[04:00.33]Oh, shit.
[04:02.09]Listen, they're moving in.
[04:04.04]They're moving in, Jermall.
[04:05.08]No, that's you!
[04:07.80]That's the second time we've done that!
[04:10.22]Listen, Jermall, you're scaring me, okay?
[04:13.08]You have to press this note.
[04:14.62]I'm not playing that game anymore.
[04:19.04]Fool me once, shame on me.
[04:20.34]Fool me twice.
[04:21.24]You're getting bankrupted.
[04:25.58]Follow me.
[04:26.18]Let's go this way.
[04:27.40]I just ruined that guy's day.
[04:33.38]It's not fair.
[04:34.79]I was trying to set a nice duel up and you ruined it.
[04:39.79]You ruined it.
[04:42.97]Oh, man.
[04:45.23]Well, I'm not going to win this one.
[04:46.49]I'm so sorry.
[04:48.18]I didn't know that was you.
[04:50.24]Oh, don't worry.
[04:51.26]I've been bankrupted probably like four times in this video.
[04:56.83]Not banked.
[04:57.53]I've just killed you.
[04:58.51]It doesn't have to be you.
[05:00.81]Shit.
[05:02.25]Who's going to win?
[05:04.05]Oh, you did.
[05:05.21]What?
[05:06.45]Yeah, that's how you do it.
[05:09.09]Apparently.
[05:11.58]I gave you kills, boo, okay?
[05:13.58]I didn't want to be that guy.
[05:14.86]No, no, no.
[05:15.82]You got me killed, dude.
[05:17.46]You betrayed me.
[05:20.31]I gave you two kills.
[05:21.47]I had to earn that spot, and I did.
[05:23.79]That's how you win.
[05:24.97]That's a W for the boo.
[05:27.11]Yeah.
[05:28.33]Getting amped.
[05:29.25]Yeah.
