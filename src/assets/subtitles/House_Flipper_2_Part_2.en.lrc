[03:03.84]But we might not do that till the first week of January.
[03:07.82]That probably makes more sense to me.
[03:17.78]So are we going to do it in March?
[03:19.00]No.
[03:26.98]But yeah.
[03:28.67]We'll figure something out.
[03:31.07]But if you don't see me after tomorrow, have a wonderful, wonderful holiday.

[04:00.14]like the dinner oh god could you kill Santa one more time for old time's sake no we patched that up last year that is completely patched up in fact I'm actually kind of annoyed that you said that because he's definitely listening
[04:24.01]Hey, Santa, I just looked up.
[04:26.79]I guess it was Santa.
[04:27.83]Let me just tell you.
[04:30.14]That wasn't me that said that.
[04:34.88]Alright.
[04:35.24]Yeah, this is sponsored again from the House Flipper 2.
[04:37.34]The devs, thank you so much for the sponsor.
[04:40.90]We're going to go over.
[04:42.02]We'll talk about the computer one more time before we go into the video game.
[04:49.69]Yeah, thank you for the sponsor, House Flipper.
[04:55.27]Again, like I said, this was a no brainer.
[04:59.03]We all know that you're Santa.
[05:08.30]He just dabbed.
[05:09.32]I heard it.
[05:10.04]What?
[05:12.42]Oh, he just.
[05:13.26]Oh, no, no, no.
[05:13.78]What do you want for Christmas?
[05:19.27]Uh.
[05:24.81]Large coin.
[05:26.51]Gold.
[05:29.77]It doesn't have to be real gold.
[05:41.05]A large gold coin.
[05:44.01]Imagine being a kid.
[05:46.37]It's like, oh, what do you want for Christmas, little Timmy?
[05:48.51]I want a large gold coin.
[05:53.08]Real.
[05:55.06]Oh, well, little Timmy, uh, gold is currently, uh, $2,900 an ounce.
[06:03.10]So, uh, don't think you're going to get that.
[06:08.29]A chocolate coin.
[06:09.19]That's right.
[06:09.47]Alright, let's get going though.
[06:11.97]Uh, I'm just going to pick up right where we left off.
[06:14.47]There's still some jobs to do and I want to buy a house.
[06:16.63]I want to furnish my house.
[06:17.75]I want to fix this one.
[06:19.63]We'll do that over the next couple of days.
[06:25.06]But yeah, let's do it.
[06:27.64]Here I am.
[06:32.93]Here I am.
[06:36.71]Okay, so, what's the last thing we did?
[06:39.05]What's the last thing?
[06:39.89]What did I just say?
[06:40.45]What's the last thing we did?
[06:41.65]I think it was a job.
[06:46.91]You cannot hear the game, but now you can.
[06:50.82]Okay, it is nighttime.
[06:51.84]I've been sitting here for about 30 minutes or so on this screen, so...
[06:55.19]Alright.
[06:56.63]Where do you want to go?
[06:58.23]Let's go to emails.
[07:01.43]Alright, we got this.
[07:05.27]New walls, new me.
[07:06.37]We haven't unlocked all the tools yet.
[07:07.89]I gotta get all those.
[07:11.86]You gonna do face camp?
[07:12.76]No, no, not today.
[07:17.72]Maybe, you know what, maybe tomorrow.
[07:19.20]Maybe tomorrow if you're good.
[07:20.70]We'll do a finale.
[07:21.20]Okay.
[07:29.10]But maybe.
[07:30.21]Maybe.
[07:33.13]You gotta make Peter Griffin's house?
[07:34.25]Maybe.
[07:34.47]Alright, so what's this one?
[07:36.47]I'm trying to rearrange my living room when I found a pretty damaged wall.
[07:40.65]Because I already need a specialist to fix it.
[07:42.66]I want to make other changes as well.
[07:44.30]I heard you might be up for the job.
[07:46.96]I guess the wall caught moisture from the bathroom, so I need some extra tiles there.
[07:50.70]We swapped the bathtub for a shower.
[07:54.28]Replace some furniture.
[07:55.12]Alright, easy.
[07:55.49]Let's go.
[08:02.36]Of course he's going to make Peter Griffin's house.
[08:14.89]This would be fucking awesome.
[08:18.53]I try to think of the pros and cons of having a house that's right here, your front door to the to the shore.
[08:26.70]And the cons that I can think of are just kind of sand is everywhere in every room, in every single crevice, and that's just the way it is.
[08:33.76]I'm imagining you... You know when you fluff a blanket?
[08:38.76]And, ah, let me take this blanket and go-goo, go-goo.
[08:41.15]We take both ends and you throw it up and you flip it down.
[08:43.99]I just feel like a bunch of sand comes out, but... And no lawn to have to deal with.
[08:52.23]And you get this.
[08:52.97]I don't know.
[08:55.13]I feel like I would want to live in a place like this.
[09:00.81]Jerma, go get some sleep.
[09:03.91]I just woke up like 45 minutes ago.
[09:06.14]Hey, dude, go get some sleep, man.
[09:10.12]You think I've been up all night?
[09:12.90]I've been playing house all night.
[09:14.12]I can't stop.
[09:14.68]This place isn't that dirty.
[09:20.48]No, go back to sleep.
[09:24.94]I'm up, what?
[09:31.68]What about the constant threat of the water?
[09:33.62]Yeah, but I know.
[09:34.94]That's true.
[09:45.47]Hmm.
[09:49.83]Is the water on both sides?
[09:54.47]Oh, I don't think so.
[09:55.23]I think that's like a highway.
[09:58.25]Yeah, no, I think that's a road.
[10:04.42]Alright, we got a lot of... I gotta paint a lot.
[10:06.82]Got a lot of stains.
[10:08.12]Okay, let's sell all this junk.
[10:12.33]What needs to be... Oh, really?
[10:13.85]This thing's fine.
[10:14.61]What's wrong with this?
[10:17.97]Hmm, okay.
[10:20.01]Board of painting.
[10:20.77]You can also use panels, wallpaper, or tiles to finish surfaces.
[10:25.24]Yep.
[10:25.88]Just like the first one.
[10:30.08]You can cover a bigger area.
[10:31.20]Okay.
[10:31.38]Cool.
[10:31.94]Remember, you need to wake up.
[10:37.71]I'm late for the stream.
[10:41.49]Right now, I am curr- This is not actually happening.
[10:45.26]I'm having a very vivid, lucid dream that- Oh!
[10:48.96]Yeah, I have- Playing, uh, House Lover 2 today.
[10:51.62]Oh, I thought I was gonna be really late, but thank god I made it on time.
[10:53.92]It's one of those- It's one of those literal dreams.
[10:56.52]It's a literal dream, I hate those.
[11:00.02]Shit.
[11:01.10]Oh no.
[11:05.99]Oh, let me try something.
[11:08.46]Ow.
[11:09.52]No, I'm here.
[11:10.56]I'm here.
[11:11.68]God, my eye fucking hurts now.
[11:12.98]Thanks.
[11:14.28]Ow.
[11:17.60]The crowd screams in applause.
[11:29.09]There we go.
[11:29.61]Okay.
[11:34.31]So you want this painted...
[11:38.52]You want stained elm panels.
[11:44.18]Cool.
[11:52.78]Oh, like this?
[11:53.74]Yeah.
[11:54.22]Okay.
[11:57.43]Do you want these over here?
[11:58.95]Right over here?
[12:08.91]Is that not where you wanted this?
[12:11.15]I think this is the floor.
[12:13.29]Alright, hold on.
[12:14.91]I may have messed up.
[12:17.93]What is this?
[12:21.01]Wait, where do you want this?
[12:22.29]Oh.
[12:27.02]I'm sorry.
[12:28.42]Okay, we're good.
[12:29.60]We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[12:38.70]This is as big as I can make it right now.
[12:41.32]That's fine.
[12:44.06]That feels good to place.
[12:45.04]Oh, I want to hear the sound.
[12:49.90]I want to really hear that sound effect.
[12:51.46]Let me see.
[13:01.34]Oh.
[13:04.84]One more.
[13:19.40]Nice.
[13:20.20]It sounds so good.
[13:20.86]Okay.
[13:31.33]That's that, right?
[13:32.71]Oh, wait, I missed a few spots.
[13:33.57]It's not supposed to go all the way in there, right?
[13:45.52]That looks fine.
[13:50.56]Now you want paint.
[13:51.84]Yellow paint faded.
[13:53.24]Okay.
[14:01.35]So that's where you want the paint.
[14:04.17]Can I do it in one go?
[14:05.55]This is a satisfying TikTok compilation game.
[14:22.70]Hey, I'll tell you, the new meta is have, you know, talk about whatever you want to talk about, but just have a house slipper wall being painted.
[14:31.04]That's perfect.
[14:33.06]You could create the new meta right now.
[14:34.94]Why did you even say that?
[14:38.55]You should just, you should sprint right now to your computer and start making the, like, the, like, fax videos.
[14:47.33]Or the, I can't believe this happened in Walmart video.
[15:05.51]Dude, it's TikTok in like YouTube shorts.
[15:08.63]I told you like, I told you I thought I was going crazy when I was watching them one time.
[15:11.61]So I just didn't watch them ever again.
[15:15.31]I swear to God, I, for like 30 or 40 minutes, I was just scrolling and then I was like, I think I'm going crazy.
[15:21.23]So I just never did it again.
[15:30.44]What do they want in here?
[15:31.88]Oh, okay.
[15:33.69]Wallpaper.
[15:34.23]This is cool.
[15:34.97]Like Minecraft.
[15:43.28]Ooh.
[15:46.24]I kind of love this.
[15:48.58]Look at the color scheme.
[15:49.79]And you tell me this was not made for me.
[16:02.88]Wow, I love it.
[16:04.59]I would sleep here every single night.
[16:07.89]It's a pattern though.
[16:08.77]Yeah, but it's gray, navy, black, and like beige.
[16:14.90]And like light blue, teal.
[16:17.52]This is everything.
[16:18.60]If I was a superhero, I would wear this as a costume.
[16:22.25]My costume would be this color scheme.
[16:33.66]I get to pick one of those.
[16:34.30]Okay, cool.
[16:38.35]TTV static?
[16:40.65]That is not... That is a really nice pattern.
[16:48.77]The colors aren't bright at all, dude.
[16:52.81]Let me pick this up because I don't need to use these anymore.
[16:57.39]Sell, sell.
[17:00.31]Sell, sell.
[17:03.31]Is this a telephone?
[17:09.37]Please give me a minute.
[17:11.11]Please give me a second.
[17:11.77]Do you know what I'm saying?
[17:14.87]Some of you... God damn it.
[17:16.63]Okay, just wait.
[17:18.07]This looks like a calculator or like an old telephone, like a landline from back here.
[17:24.28]Do you see this bump?
[17:26.78]That looks like a phone and then this is the place where the phone goes or... It does.
[17:31.50]Yeah, this looks like a telephone.
[17:33.94]I thought this was a telephone.
[17:39.41]As I'm looking around, like, okay, what's over here?
[17:41.15]What's over there?
[17:41.99]Like, this is a telephone in my head.
[17:43.65]Remember, half of your audience does not know about old telephones.
[18:03.23]It will grow up.
[18:17.75]I can't.
[18:18.45]Wait, you're not old enough to know about the old telephone?
[18:25.88]Grow up.
[18:27.20]Literally.
[18:27.62]I think we're good.
[18:32.40]I don't like where this is, though.
[18:46.76]Grown-ass man, yeah.
[18:51.76]I don't love this TV placement, though.
[18:56.95]I don't love this.
[19:05.65]The yoga mat's not more important than the centering of the television.
[19:10.03]It's the most important thing.
[19:13.55]This has to be centered on whatever it's on, or I will scream.
[19:16.79]There we go.
[19:27.64]What if this is the wrong house?
[19:28.64]That'd be weird.
[19:33.26]Pizza rolls or bagels?
[19:34.96]Hmm.
[19:38.98]Probably pizza bagels.
[19:43.19]I feel like there's a lot more going on there.
[19:45.91]Plus, pizza rolls tend to be a little too hot.
[19:51.01]I have the problem I've ever... And I don't really eat pizza rolls anymore.
[19:53.74]I can't remember the last time I had a pizza roll.
[19:56.78]But... The thing that I do remember when eating them...
[20:02.31]They would come out of the, you know, whatever, toaster oven or microwave.
[20:04.90]How have you made them?
[20:06.08]It's been so long, I don't even remember how you make them.
[20:08.96]They would come out so, so hot.
[20:11.96]And you couldn't eat them for like 40 minutes.
[20:14.64]And then finally, when you thought it was cool enough, you took a bite and they were cold in the middle.
[20:17.86]Or they were like lukewarm.
[20:18.98]And it's like, god damn it.
[20:20.00]There's a perfect period that you have to eat a pizza roll.
[20:24.20]And it's like four total minutes where you can actually eat them.
[20:28.64]Grow up, somebody said.
[20:31.42]Fair.
[20:32.95]That's fair.
[20:33.23]Yeah, that's fair.
[20:41.68]I don't wait.
[20:42.12]Is there a table?
[20:42.68]There is.
[20:42.96]Hmm.
[20:52.88]I got 22,000 after this job.
[20:54.63]I'm going to do a little bit of work on my house.
[20:58.21]I have some ideas.
[21:01.95]But we need money.
[21:02.45]I mean, we need... I only have 22,000.
[21:04.86]I need more money.
[21:08.52]Nothing out here.
[21:08.94]Okay.
[21:11.12]This is a grown-ass man complaining about pizza rolls.
[21:14.42]Yeah, I'm a grown-ass man.
[21:17.06]And... But I did just clarify that I don't... I haven't had a pizza roll... I cannot remember the last time I ate one.
[21:25.10]So, yeah, I'm a grown-ass man telling you that when I was younger, in my younger years...
[21:30.97]Yes.
[21:31.89]What is this?
[21:34.79]Oh.
[21:37.49]I don't love where that is either.
[21:41.00]Yeah, and you know what?
[21:41.60]Whatever.
[21:42.20]If I feel like eating a pizza roll if I'm 60... What is this?
[21:45.98]Is the checkout clerk gonna tell me no?
[21:49.67]Excuse me, sir.
[21:51.13]Yes?
[21:52.67]Uh, these are pizza rolls.
[21:53.55]These are for children.
[21:55.35]Okay.
[21:56.61]You can go ahead and shut the fuck up and put them in the goddamn bag.
[21:59.03]Because I don't want to... Okay, I'm a grown-ass fucking man.
[22:09.71]And then they get on the loudspeaker.
[22:11.93]Oh, no, that's fine.
[22:13.53]Can we get a price check on a children's item?
[22:24.86]I think I just described every other scene from like a 90s comedy TV show.
[22:39.09]Okay.
[22:42.99]Uh.
[22:44.29]A new cabinet.
[22:48.23]Where is this going to go?
[22:53.83]Hmm.
[22:58.73]I don't know about this one.
[23:01.59]I feel like this is on the left.
[23:08.91]Yeah, I think so.
[23:15.98]What about Uncrustables?
[23:17.06]They're good.
[23:25.70]Eat whatever you want.
[23:26.32]Just don't eat it every day.
[23:28.80]Let me help.
[23:29.12]Let me help you here.
[23:30.26]Eat whatever the fuck you want.
[23:31.86]Just don't eat it every single day and make sure you eat enough like vegetables to balance out your fucking pizza rolls.
[23:39.48]Simple.
[23:44.37]This is way worse.
[23:52.75]Shit.
[23:54.63]Pizza is a vegetable.
[23:58.54]Didn't you say the same thing about mayonnaise like four years ago?
[24:03.25]Yeah, I said just eat things that are you can eat bad stuff, but just don't eat bad stuff for every single meal you ever have in your whole life.
[24:26.24]What's my favorite vegetable?
[24:27.84]I think somebody in chat could answer that.
[24:29.08]If you've been around for a little while.
[24:43.67]Radishes, that's right.
[24:47.83]Just a regular radish.
[24:49.27]Cold, not cooked.
[24:51.72]Obviously, you know, washed.
[24:53.26]But chopped up, that's fine.
[24:55.20]I like them as little balls.
[24:57.92]They got a little bit of zing to them.
[25:03.84]Unwashed.
[25:05.39]Put the sofa against the wall.
[25:12.55]Like back here?
[25:13.53]That blocks the door though, right?
[25:14.93]Yeah, this is a door.
[25:18.85]I think it kind of has to be here.
[25:23.05]Yeah, when in doubt, radish it out.
[25:24.05]That's true.
[25:30.93]This room is done.
[25:31.87]There's still something dirty here though.
[25:33.23]Where is it?
[25:42.34]I don't have to be a perfectionist.
[25:43.60]I can do two stars.
[25:44.96]Because I want to start buying stuff.
[25:49.65]But this is going to drive me crazy.
[25:52.64]Where is it?
[25:53.02]Does anybody see it?
[25:57.08]I don't see it.
[26:03.96]It's behind a cabin.
[26:09.93]Table's way too close to the counter.
[26:16.24]Yeah, but I really want them to be able to smell the food.
[26:18.08]I want it to be an experience when I cook for you.
[26:25.87]My dad loves radishes with salt and pepper.
[26:27.77]Your dad must have 130 IQ at least.
[26:33.25]And I'm saying at least.
[26:38.49]Where is this last... Whatever, I can't get it.
[26:41.35]I can.
[26:41.59]But I have to stop moving furniture.
[26:45.37]Where's this last piece of dirt?
[26:56.92]No, I don't know where it is.
[26:58.36]Where's the last spot?
[27:05.73]Where is it?
[27:17.93]I still didn't get it.
[27:23.05]You have 985 IQ.
[27:25.47]Yeah, my IQ is absolutely dropped.
[27:27.09]We've gone over this.
[27:28.37]I don't know where it is, so we're going to move on.
[27:32.33]I've taken three IQ tests over the course of my life, and I mean, I've taken real ones, not like, oh, click here for the four question IQ test.
[27:41.68]Like, I'm not talking about that.
[27:43.04]I'm talking about I've taken a real one that takes like three hours.
[27:46.66]um it was like 120 but I had a really really awful performance iq which it was like they were like wait this is I think there's something like I it was so low that like they almost didn't think I understood the test correctly they were like he might need to retake that
[28:12.79]Then I took it again years later.
[28:13.99]Obviously, I have, you know, ADHD, but I don't really care.
[28:17.97]I don't, you know, it's just the thing.
[28:20.09]You just live with it.
[28:22.99]Deal with it.
[28:24.39]Do what you do.
[28:28.17]Try not to let it get you.
[28:29.25]What is happening here?
[28:37.15]Is that the dirt?
[28:38.05]No, it's a different place.
[28:48.10]Nice.
[28:48.50]There's still... Oh, they want a new tub, right?
[28:56.84]It's a shower.
[28:57.50]They want a new shower.
[29:10.40]Whoa.
[29:14.22]Wait, what?
[29:25.66]Is this a thing?
[29:26.64]This is actually like kind of cool.
[29:32.67]Is this a drain here?
[29:43.39]What is this called?
[29:51.09]Did I not assemble it?
[29:52.77]Because this is... I actually kind of... Yeah, this needs to go against the other wall.
[30:04.91]Oh, it wants it here.
[30:10.34]I've never seen a shower that wasn't enclosed.
[30:12.98]It's just open.
[30:16.44]That's kind of cool, though.
[30:17.38]I kind of like that a lot.
[30:20.49]Because sometimes just simply like pulling over the curtain and I mean, I guess the curtain would be here and here.
[30:27.99]You definitely want a curtain.
[30:29.37]You're just walking in here.
[30:32.65]Yeah, I'm ready to take my shower.
[30:33.85]I'm just standing here naked.
[30:39.52]Okay, cool.
[30:39.84]I think that's done, right?
[30:44.36]Oh, right.
[30:44.90]Okay, you want this.
[31:00.48]Walk-in showers?
[31:07.30]Walk-in showers do exist.
[31:10.18]But I'm not used to a walk-in shower that has no door or slider or something.
[31:18.89]You see a lot of those in hotels, right?
[31:27.64]What kind of wallpaper do you think you'd be?
[31:31.70]Uh, something from Willy Wonka.
[31:37.64]It's like something like Dr. Seuss or something.
[31:39.70]Willy Wonka.
[31:42.27]Some clown, some clown shit, you know?
[31:45.19]Alright, three stars.
[31:46.19]That one was pretty easy.
[31:52.43]By the way, I heard that the Wonka movie was awesome.
[31:55.37]I heard it was very, very good.
[31:57.43]Does that mean they're going to bring the fucking chocolate bar back?
[32:00.97]Where's the chocolate bar?
[32:02.03]Are they going to bring that back?
[32:04.35]I'll give that a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[32:15.60]Movie's good.
[32:16.08]Where's the chocolate bar?
[32:18.02]Where's the bar?
[32:18.78]This is dirty.
[32:25.78]What?
[32:33.52]This isn't dirty.
[32:34.83]Why is it so dark?
[32:35.95]There's no lights.
[32:37.35]Do I have a light switch in here?
[32:41.55]Oh.
[32:41.67]I thought that was a fire alarm.
[32:48.22]I was like, why is there a fire alarm in the house?
[32:52.89]Okay, cool.
[33:02.23]Alright, I got money.
[33:04.05]How much does some of this stuff cost?
[33:08.14]How much is a banana?
[33:10.56]Ten dollars for a banana!
[33:13.60]I want one.
[33:22.25]I gotta pick a room here, because I have- this place is a disaster.
[33:30.19]This wall is coming down.
[33:31.81]I have to unlock the tool, but this whole thing is coming down.
[33:35.67]And this is being made all the way through the top floor.
[33:41.03]I'm going to have a hole that can go through.
[33:43.01]It's going to be incredible.
[33:45.51]There's going to be a little tiny, like, Fraggle Rock kind of character roller coaster that goes through the whole house.
[34:02.46]But I think we've been, it's been a little while.
[34:03.98]I just want to show this one more time because I want to and House Flipper devs want it to be shown and they've sponsored the stream and they are going to get that.
[34:12.72]So here it is.
[34:15.14]They are doing a contest right now.
[34:19.40]Houseflipper2.com slash contest.
[34:24.50]Very, very cool thing.
[34:27.18]If you get the grand prize of this contest,
[34:30.86]You are going to take home this beauty right here.
[34:35.40]This is a computer.
[34:40.71]I don't think you know how badly I actually want this thing.
[34:45.21]Here's what's in it.
[34:48.81]Things pretty slick.
[34:55.65]Yeah, so they're doing a contest, this whole community contest.
[34:58.13]The game is directly kind of tied and connected into mod.io.
[35:02.21]But it's not just the computer.
[35:03.95]They're giving away this stuff too.
[35:05.95]For winning.
[35:08.93]Tons of different prizes.
[35:11.55]I have the gamepad.
[35:12.83]I'll show it tomorrow.
[35:16.35]So what are you going to do?
[35:18.07]Obviously get the game.
[35:19.66]Download the competition project from here.
[35:22.24]If you just go to houseflipper.com slash contest, you'll be able to click that.
[35:25.46]It's at mod.io, community contest.
[35:28.92]You're going to make this dream island house.
[35:32.88]You're going to add your project to mod.io.
[35:34.98]Follow the instructions.
[35:37.93]Tag your project.
[35:40.39]And you have about 47 days from right now.
[35:48.32]to do it.
[35:48.96]There are currently 3,300 entries.
[35:53.08]There were, what, 2,200, 2,400 last night?
[35:56.26]Yesterday?
[36:01.49]And you could win the custom PC.
[36:06.89]But I think it looks cool.
[36:10.25]This case is just... I wonder how big it is.
[36:12.17]How big is this case?
[36:14.11]Is it huge, I wonder?
[36:21.81]Small prizes?
[36:22.47]Yeah, it looks like they're, it's not just, this is the grand prize.
[36:27.15]There's a AMD CPU.
[36:30.34]There's a Radeon 7600.
[36:32.08]There are, whoops.
[36:36.20]There's game pads.
[36:37.96]There's pads.
[36:40.78]And then there's a bunch of these too.
[36:45.50]But that's really cool.
[36:49.99]It's a pretty slick PC, if you ask me.
[36:55.45]Yeah.
[36:57.55]Very cute.
[36:59.72]And that's going again until January 31st of 2024.
[37:04.40]Thank you, House Flipper Devs.
[37:08.70]Let's continue.
[37:12.14]I would love to see Otto sitting next to that.
[37:24.36]That's a lot of entries so far, too.
[37:29.50]Over 3,000.
[37:31.41]But honestly, that's a lot of entries, but I don't think that's too many entries to, like, not have a pretty good chance.
[37:37.97]That's not... You got a chance.
[37:39.51]Especially if you make something really good.
[37:43.47]Alright, where do I want to start?
[37:49.20]We'll see where it is in 47 days, but, you know, you got plenty of time.
[37:55.56]You didn't finish your IQ story.
[37:56.86]I think I did.
[38:04.14]Didn't I say I had a really high verbal and visual IQ?
[38:13.18]But my performance IQ was just very bad.
[38:17.32]And look, you've been watching.
[38:18.53]A lot of you guys have been here for like 12 years.
[38:21.89]Look what just happened.
[38:23.11]Think about it.
[38:24.17]Break down the last 5 minutes.
[38:25.78]The last 10 minutes, even.
[38:28.14]I haven't done any... I've just been walking around the house talking.
[38:31.72]Like, I can't do two... I can't do two things at the same time.
[38:35.66]I build a house, put it down, build a house, put it down, build a house, put it down to tell a 10-minute story.
[38:42.11]My brain goes on total, complete autopilot.
[38:46.36]But not the kind of autopilot that completes tasks.
[38:49.94]The kind of autopilot that a World of Warcraft NPC has.
[38:53.82]Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!
[39:15.56]You hear that sound, you're fucking dead, by the way.
[39:18.26]That is the sound that nobody wants to hear.
[39:21.16]In World of Warcraft.
[39:23.12]You hear that sound?
[39:24.72]You better fucking run.
[39:28.02]Uh-oh.
[39:30.10]Uh-oh, I'm dead.
[39:34.82]Okay, let's go to the bedroom.
[39:37.26]No, let's do a job.
[39:39.62]Because I need to unlock the...
[39:43.91]What is this?
[39:45.39]How is this?
[39:45.95]How are your adventures going?
[39:51.37]Oh, this is just little kind of tidbits.
[39:52.91]I thought you're going to spruce your house up.
[39:56.43]I need the the destruction tool.
[40:04.67]After Party Aftermath.
[40:06.89]I make some extra money by renting my garage to aspiring bands.
[40:09.99]Nothing big, usually.
[40:10.99]But last weekend, the Meowing Stones gave a concert from my garage.
[40:15.99]Can you imagine?
[40:18.25]I was so excited.
[40:19.13]I've always wanted to run a music club, and this is the closest I've ever got to living the dream.
[40:23.71]Yet.
[40:24.65]I realized that the cleaning part is not something I'm waiting for.
[40:29.30]The afterparty went so wild that my living room is in a sorry state, to be honest.
[40:34.02]But the front man offered to pay for everything.
[40:36.74]So it's the perfect time to modernize the interior a bit.
[40:40.00]Can't wait to see my new and clean living room.
[40:41.82]Oh my god, they fucking trashed the place!
[40:56.54]Who's, like, bare feet of these?
[40:59.15]Who, like, walked around in paint?
[41:05.23]What?
[41:07.93]Who's walking around in, like, paint just walking around the whole house?
[41:16.95]Somebody's pissed in the shower, too, yeah.
[41:21.89]Okay, I get this part.
[41:22.93]This part makes sense to me, right?
[41:24.32]I get this.
[41:28.32]Let's play some detective work.
[41:36.29]This is just slice of pizza and broken bottles.
[41:39.03]This OK, I this this is fine.
[41:42.67]But once you take it inside, that's when you've crossed.
[41:45.49]You've crossed too many lines.
[41:49.77]Yeah, yeah, you've crossed way too many lines.
[41:51.61]The second that you want to go into the oh, you've crossed way too many lines.
[41:54.91]Holy shit, never mind.
[41:57.66]I wish I saw that concert.
[41:59.34]Why?
[42:20.62]I don't think we know each other.
[42:40.21]And I'll tell you a secret.
[42:41.83]That little kitty should practice from time to time.
[42:44.91]I think it hit like three notes during the whole thing.
[42:48.13]But the show we gave, the most adorable thing I've ever seen.
[42:52.67]Oh, I almost forgot.
[42:53.93]I'm not calling just to give you a recap of the month of the year.
[42:57.29]No, no.
[42:58.47]I'm calling because my roommate asked me to tell you she wants to have nothing done in her room.
[43:04.52]It's the one on the right when you go upstairs.
[43:06.50]But let me tell you something.
[43:13.91]This person puked 100%.
[43:14.37]That's the like, lift the fucking thing up.
[43:15.41]Ugh.
[43:15.53]Yeah, this is a lot of movement up here.
[43:16.83]To me, this is, okay.
[43:17.45]We're doing detective work.
[43:18.27]Where does this start?
[43:19.09]Okay, out here?
[43:19.99]Right, okay, so you are out here.
[43:44.49]Where were you?
[43:46.63]Oh, no.
[43:47.17]OK, where you started over here.
[43:49.11]I think this is the drummer.
[43:52.11]OK, so the drummer rocks the fuck out, we're talking like.
[44:03.14]And then and then like the wow, it hit the fucking whatever the six fucking cocktails you've had.
[44:12.09]Are just coming up on you.
[44:13.01]And like the probably eight cigarettes you've had in the last 25 minutes.
[44:16.79]So he gets up.
[44:17.93]Slips.
[44:18.27]Because fucking come on, man.
[44:19.74]Somebody put some shit here.
[44:20.54]And he slips on it.
[44:21.92]Takes another step.
[44:22.60]Step.
[44:23.04]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[44:24.40]See you later.
[44:25.46]Thanks for coming.
[44:27.72]SLIP AGAINST SLIP!
[44:28.64]And people are like, oh fuck.
[44:30.14]He just slipped.
[44:30.70]It's alright though, he'll be fine.
[44:31.98]Takes a couple walks.
[44:33.16]Somebody else slips in front of him.
[44:34.56]He probably like, helps.
[44:35.20]Like, whoa, you okay?
[44:35.96]Yeah, I'm good.
[44:36.54]Like, they slip a couple more times.
[44:38.25]He's doing alright.
[44:39.31]He gets to hear it SLIP again.
[44:40.79]Gets to hear it SLIP again.
[44:43.27]How many times does this guy like, slide?
[44:45.09]Okay, then this way, this way, this way.
[44:48.45]All the way around here.
[44:49.48]Does he knock all this shit over?
[44:54.25]Maybe he's grabbing.
[45:02.19]He gets to here.
[45:02.83]Do I puke in the fucking toilet, or do I puke in the sink, or do I puke in the bathroom?
[45:09.61]I don't know, because this one, I'll puke in the bathroom.
[45:11.89]Nope.
[45:13.99]He made it.
[45:20.28]You should do the other footsteps.
[45:24.37]I have to clean the house.
[45:25.85]But first of all, I wanted to make a comment.
[45:29.11]That was very funny that... I'm imagining hiring a contractor to do something.
[45:38.24]And I've never met this person before.
[45:41.38]And it's like, oh yeah, they come.
[45:42.54]Oh yeah, wow, look at this.
[45:44.12]Oh yeah, nice to meet you.
[45:45.58]Shake hand.
[45:46.10]Nice to meet you.
[45:46.84]Yeah, we had a party last night.
[45:48.65]Oh, why wasn't I invited?
[45:50.29]I wish I could have gone.
[45:53.00]Yeah, um... Yes?
[45:55.74]What's your name?
[45:56.40]Oh, okay.
[46:04.11]Maybe next time.
[46:05.57]Am I gonna sell the drums?
[46:10.54]No.
[46:25.51]Oh, that's too bad.
[46:30.01]Okay.
[46:31.09]This is a mess.
[46:35.45]Okay, so let's... I'll investigate the other ones.
[46:38.71]Alright, this person here is standing here.
[46:41.87]And they're very clearly standing.
[46:43.28]Their feet are together.
[46:45.57]I don't know if they, like, sneezed out this, or they spilt it, or whatever, or if they were, I don't know, like, I don't know what they were doing.
[46:52.52]Where did they end up going?
[46:53.26]They went this way.
[46:54.98]Somebody, at some point, I don't know if that's blood, but, there's a shattering of a table, and there's blood.
[47:03.03]It's this person.
[47:03.99]This person, okay, I know what happened.
[47:06.57]This person got shit-faced and took a bunch of drugs, or something, and they, they, like, jumped through a table.
[47:12.31]And everybody, like, screamed and cheered and stuff.
[47:16.03]I'm like, oh my God, bro.
[47:18.65]And he started fleeting and he's like, he's in his bare feet.
[47:21.31]He's like, we're going to get out of here.
[47:25.16]And the footprints stop.
[47:30.06]Did the ambulance pull up on the curb?
[47:33.44]And just take him?
[47:36.50]Yeah, whoever this is, they elbow dropped through this table.
[47:40.76]And then they got, they're gone.
[47:43.97]He started doing a handstand.
[47:45.24]Okay, I have to... I gotta clean this.
[47:56.53]Yeah, that is a hun... This is blood.
[47:59.63]That is blood on the ground.
[48:01.09]And this person is walking in it.
[48:13.60]I want to see how many trash bags it makes.
[48:15.20]Two so far.
[48:27.74]Hmm.
[48:32.50]The blood would be more brown now?
[48:39.07]Yeah...
[48:42.04]Alright, we got CSI Andy over here.
[48:50.66]Nah, nah, nah.
[48:51.54]It's inaccurate.
[48:52.42]It'd be brown.
[48:56.13]Stop saying Andy.
[48:58.27]It's been burned into my brain.
[49:00.95]I can't.
[49:01.77]I can't stop it.
[49:04.35]Like I told you guys before, it's just a new way to have, like, mafia titles.
[49:09.69]We talked about this.
[49:11.33]Like, uh, yeah.
[49:12.19]What's his name?
[49:12.85]Yeah, that's fucking Gary the Schnaz.
[49:16.09]Schnaz Andy.
[49:20.04]Oh, that's... They call him... They call him Frankie the Chair.
[49:25.90]Because when he sits down and when he stands up, you know, you're fucking dead.
[49:30.68]Chair Andy.
[49:35.94]So, please.
[49:36.98]It's... We've modernized it a little.
[49:43.60]Yeah, they call this guy the fucking Ice Pick.
[49:47.69]Bobby the Ice Pick.
[49:49.60]Ice Pick Andy.
[49:58.93]Although, now that I think about it, if I was like the mafia and I was Chair Andy, I feel like that would not be as hard-hitting as, you know, like Ricky the Chair.
[50:13.68]So, yeah, that's true.
[50:19.32]Oh, who is your mob team?
[50:21.44]Uh, Chair Andy, Ice Pick Andy, uh, that's, uh, that's, uh, Fruit Punch Andy.
[50:27.39]That's, uh, oh, and he's called that because he kills people by drowning them in Fruit Punch.
[50:31.55]Uh, Fruit Punch Andy, we have Trash Bag Andy, we have, uh, we have Ice Skating Andy.
[50:36.03]Yeah, it doesn't really hit as hard, does it?
[50:39.35]That's true.
[50:53.94]He's all gotta go.
[50:54.62]Alright, get him all out of here.
[51:05.74]Don't forget Andy, Andy.
[51:10.67]It's just an easy, quick way to just describe anything.
[51:16.53]It really just is.
[51:24.45]I think we're good on that.
[51:27.21]There's still one poster.
[51:28.15]Where is it?
[51:32.77]Oh, there it is.
[51:37.64]Can you do the giant enemy spider?
[51:39.84]No.
[51:44.30]No.
[51:44.66]That'll be in the Jerma Greatest Hits Volume 1.
[51:48.29]It's going to have one volume.
[51:51.99]This is going to be three fucking tracks.
[51:55.15]And it's going to be $75.
[52:12.63]But it's going to it's going to go on sale.
[52:17.77]Okay, if you had a, if you made like a game or something on Steam, or you made like a movie or a TV show or something, and you sold it.
[52:26.09]Like, could you say this game is $500, but it is 95% off?
[52:37.04]You could.
[52:39.68]And could you have it be that, I mean, I have a 100% coupon.
[52:49.11]Like, imagine, like, the infomercial, like, the first, this album, whatever, it's like, oh, it's, you know, it's, it's, it's, you would imagine paying, how much would you pay for, like, an album?
[52:57.03]Like, just like a, like a 10 to, like, 9 to, what, 15 track album?
[53:02.93]10 bucks?
[53:03.37]15 bucks?
[53:03.55]20 bucks?
[53:03.91]30 bucks, maybe?
[53:05.19]Depends on what it is.
[53:08.01]20, 30 bucks?
[53:09.69]Yeah, so if the commercial for this was on TV and it was like, and this is because it is so many rare clips and it's so incredibly hard to find and it's all compiled for you.
[53:23.73]We are selling this one-of-a-kind piece for $250.
[53:29.72]But because we're commemorating Jerma's retirement, it's going to be going on sale on
[53:35.90]for 97% off.
[53:38.80]Indefinitely.
[53:45.47]Missed a spot.
[53:46.39]I get it.
[53:51.85]You just walked into the glass bur- Whatever.
[53:55.55]You just walked into the glass door like a bird.
[54:05.15]I like the sound a lot.
[54:06.55]It's great.
[54:18.08]That would be in the clearance bin at Walmart.
[54:23.61]Yeah, I... No.
[54:25.91]No, by the way, that is never happening.
[54:30.41]They both tried to go in at the same time.
[54:34.03]The drummer and somebody else both opened the door at the same time.
[54:37.71]Did I get everything?
[54:45.48]A little bit more.
[54:46.34]I think that's everything out here.
[54:55.95]Yep, that's good.
[54:57.33]I could rearrange, but nah.
[55:01.14]Until your grandkids want some easy money.
[55:04.07]No, I am protecting it.
[55:06.17]It's... No.
[55:08.49]Nope.
[55:09.53]No grandkids are going to be able to do anything.
[55:13.23]No, no, no, no.
[55:14.17]No grandkid like 3,000 years from now is going to, you know, be like, you know what?
[55:17.91]We're going to add like more like fucking Jerma content.
[55:21.13]No, not happening.
[55:27.68]No, absolutely not.
[55:28.90]Guys...
[55:34.24]Why am I using a tiny rag?
[55:35.43]Because I don't have any... I got to get more perks.
[55:46.83]Now, I'm making a clause in... And that just says, uh, if you want to use me, like, far into the future when I'm gone, this is gonna be one line.
[55:59.69]It's gonna say, no, period, space, fuck you.
[56:04.37]That's it.
[56:25.72]I'll leave him a tape.
[56:28.08]You know?
[56:28.90]That's just like, hello grandkids.
[56:33.04]It's time to start your treasure hunt.
[56:35.86]We already talked about this.
[56:36.92]They aren't getting shit.
[56:38.60]They're getting a treasure hunt.
[56:51.51]You're treating your grandkids like a Saw movie?
[56:54.39]Hello again, kids.
[56:56.69]It's me, Grandpa.
[57:00.26]Before you lies a treasure map.
[57:07.15]But it's rigged to explode if you touch it.
[57:16.14]Grandkids, what you need to be very aware of in this house that you've just inherited is when you pick up that paper underneath the treasure map, gas bill will be underneath it.
[57:31.89]It hasn't been paid in nine years.
[57:35.60]Good luck.
[57:53.61]Can you do doy doy doy?
[57:54.83]Nah.
[57:56.95]Nah.
[57:58.27]Nah, I'm good.
[58:02.71]What is this thing?
[58:04.45]I love this thing.
[58:05.31]What is it?
[58:07.61]What is that?
[58:08.18]Is it like a gopher?
[58:11.22]I want one of these.
[58:12.52]What is this thing?
[58:19.12]What is it?
[58:20.76]Is it a mouse?
[58:22.00]A hamster?
[58:35.60]I don't know, but I love it.
[58:47.79]Can you tell me about your hidden treasure?
[58:50.59]Right before, I didn't see what you said, sorry.
[58:52.69]Okay, everything in here pretty much has to go.
[59:05.29]Even the TV?
[59:06.31]Okay.
[59:14.59]Thank... Wait.
[59:16.33]Thank God it's staying.
[59:17.99]The little hamster statue.
[59:23.59]Remember when you said you wanted a huge lizard and wanted to give it its own bedroom in your house?
[59:29.19]Yeah.
[59:34.46]That's true.
[59:35.78]I did say that.
[59:36.74]Those words did come out of my mouth, you're right.
[59:40.18]Alright, the kitchen is... Nothing has to be done here, so I can just go out here.
[59:45.95]What gives?
[59:54.63]Yeah, I'm kind of a big lizard fan.
[60:06.84]Alright, any more trash?
[60:08.80]Yes.
[60:08.98]I think we're clean.
[60:15.49]We are.
[60:17.33]Still a few more things to sell.
[60:23.65]Very nice.
[60:25.09]Keeping the chairs.
[60:26.01]Alright.
[60:26.43]They're not bad.
[60:26.91]They're fine.
[60:33.86]What would you name the lizard?
[60:38.70]Mm-hmm.
[60:42.38]Lloyd.
[60:49.56]And then if there's ever, like, a, like, you know, like, a, a, a danger.
[60:52.30]If there's ever, like, a, a situation where, like, I need to fight.
[60:57.44]I open up Lloyd's room.
[61:00.04]And I just go, Lloyd, get him!
[61:01.92]And Lloyd just fucking runs down the stairs as a dinosaur and attacks.
[61:12.29]And then right after, it's like, oh, wow, he's so excited.
[61:15.34]And I throw him a raw chicken.
[61:16.74]And he's just like...
[61:41.96]Dude, please play Lego Fortnite.
[61:43.78]No, just because a Lego was added in front of the title doesn't mean I want to play Fortnite.
[61:55.67]Lloyd the Lizard.
[61:56.55]That's right.
[61:56.91]I think it's a good name.
[62:05.35]This is done.
[62:06.79]Although, come on.
[62:07.79]I got to fix this.
[62:08.61]This can't be like this.
[62:22.15]Are you on copious amounts of alcohol?
[62:25.23]No.
[62:26.87]I am not.
[62:32.32]I did just drink a coffee.
[62:35.92]It is 11 AM so.
[62:39.42]Anything in here?
[62:40.16]Nope, just OK, just that.
[62:43.67]Wait.
[62:45.43]OK.
[62:58.45]Oh.
[63:07.30]Caffeine addict.
[63:11.26]I mean, probably.
[63:11.94]I would say, yeah.
[63:20.24]It's actually kind of interesting because I probably should really reduce the amount of coffee that I drink.
[63:31.04]I probably will end up at some point switching to decaf.
[63:34.08]Because I'm a two coffee enjoyer.
[63:39.37]The first coffee is for function.
[63:43.07]Right?
[63:43.69]I want to get up.
[63:44.37]I want to get my day going.
[63:45.39]I'm still groggy and tired.
[63:47.81]I need something to get me going.
[63:49.51]The second coffee is just for fun.
[63:52.95]It's just for sipping because I like it.
[63:56.02]So I'm thinking like that first coffee is a...
[64:00.83]You know, that's... You do caffeine for that one, the second one is decaf.
[64:04.59]That makes sense to me.
[64:09.23]I'm... I'm into that.
[64:17.77]Would Lloyd live upstairs or downstairs?
[64:21.39]Lloyd would be able to pick whatever room Lloyd wanted to live in.
[64:26.59]Lloyd would go in the front door and be like...
[64:45.99]and I'll be like alright this is the one I just looked I just looked over at chat and just I don't know how many people were on board for that one
[65:19.72]What the fuck?
[65:31.81]Okay.
[65:45.99]It has to be in here to complete the quest!
[65:50.05]Alright, let's see.
[65:50.87]Sofa.
[65:51.35]Where do I want to put that?
[66:05.99]Read the clock?
[66:08.89]It's 10 o'clock.
[66:22.05]AM or PM?
[66:24.73]That doesn't exist on an analog clock.
[66:28.75]I can read an analog clock!
[66:30.23]I was just wicked high when I did it that time!
[66:33.59]And it was wicked embarrassing!
[66:46.45]To me, potted plants are always in a corner.
[66:50.74]Didn't you say you were lying about that?
[66:53.58]Yeah, I want it to be a total mystery.
[66:55.60]So half of you don't know.
[67:06.27]Sunflower update.
[67:10.97]It's December, so they are no longer with us.
[67:15.36]But they shined very brightly.
[67:18.02]They were very beautiful.
[67:20.40]And they gave us lots of seeds.
[67:23.68]They were very nice.
[67:30.01]Yeah, most sunflowers are not all year round.
[67:34.45]They grow once and then they go away and then they die.
[67:41.66]It's kind of sad.
[67:42.78]It actually kind of is.
[67:45.29]Because you're like, oh, yay, my plant.
[67:46.77]It's going to be fine.
[67:47.43]It just sits there forever.
[67:48.77]For as long as it lives.
[67:50.95]But sunflowers are just one season.
[67:52.50]And then when they start to go, it's like, yeah, you're... That's it.
[67:58.96]You lived and now you're gone.
[68:01.32]You killed them.
[68:05.40]Alright, hold on.
[68:05.78]Let me stop World of Warcraft NPC walking.
[68:07.83]Alright, TV.
[68:11.93]TV volume up.
[68:18.43]Okay, I did this on purpose because I wanted to make it like a doctor's office.
[68:21.39]Like a waiting room.
[68:21.99]Okay, that's good.
[68:28.66]Maybe a little lower.
[68:33.32]Yeah.
[68:36.26]There's a reason sunflower seeds are harvested.
[68:41.12]Switch the sofa and the TV around.
[68:43.80]Will that fit in there?
[68:52.00]It does.
[68:52.28]It's a little bare over here.
[68:53.18]Hold on.
[68:59.72]I don't know if I love this.
[69:01.32]I feel like if I had my arm over here, over the armrest, I feel like this is just a wall over here.
[69:08.28]There's no end tables either.
[69:09.42]Yeah.
[69:10.86]That's not comfortable.
[69:12.93]No, I'm not doing that.
[69:14.65]But that is a perfect cut for this couch.
[69:19.29]Was that intentional?
[69:21.33]I think that was intentional.
[69:24.72]It fits too perfectly.
[69:27.58]It was measured to be like that.
[69:31.20]I think that... Oh, no.
[70:17.94]Ooh.
[70:18.18]I love a good circle rug.
[70:25.64]Isn't a circle rug really just inviting?
[70:28.99]Whenever I see a circle rug, I just want to just plop and just sit.
[70:33.89]Anybody else like that?
[70:36.37]Something about it.
[70:37.17]Especially if it's high shag.
[70:56.68]I love sitting on the floor.
[70:58.61]It could be really nice.
[71:04.17]How's this work?
[71:12.44]Some of these have to go.
[71:18.35]There's still stuff to sell.
[71:27.49]TV cabinet?
[71:32.56]Wait a minute.
[71:34.94]Is this perfectly cut for this space?
[71:36.92]It is.
[72:01.45]That feels better to me.
[72:02.54]It does.
[72:02.98]The other way, it just doesn't.
[72:04.52]No.
[72:04.86]I don't like that.
[72:05.28]I don't like being closed in.
[72:09.38]Too much of an enclosure.
[72:10.46]No.
[72:13.76]Please move the TV lower.
[72:14.86]I mean, they want it on the wall.
[72:20.47]Okay.
[72:28.49]Almost done.
[72:35.85]At structural integrity, not very good.
[72:38.93]I'm going to points deducted.
[72:51.03]I got a lot of consoles, right?
[72:52.44]I mean, it's got a lot of games, a lot of physical media.
[73:05.33]What else needs to be sold?
[73:08.02]Remote and a... Okay, here's the ball.
[73:10.16]Where's the remote over here?
[73:13.00]Nice.
[73:13.34]Alright, nothing else in here.
[73:15.58]Nothing in here.
[73:16.70]Everything looks good.
[73:19.10]Hey, look!
[73:21.08]Much better than it looked before.
[73:28.31]If only these objects were floating around and not grounded by the laws of gravity.
[73:36.37]This is in the wall.
[74:16.56]I want to see what it sounded like.
[74:18.50]So I can be prepared if it's ever a problem.
[74:27.77]So where's the last star?
[74:29.97]Where's the last star?
[74:32.73]What am I missing?
[74:42.46]I know, I'm not supposed to be perfectionist.
[74:44.46]There we go.
[74:51.99]This is how you get to three.
[75:03.18]Where is it?
[75:03.64]Damn it.
[75:08.18]The one trash is going to mess me up, isn't it?
[75:10.52]And not get me this one.
[75:11.90]It's one piece.
[75:12.86]There it is.
[75:14.54]What?
[75:16.69]I'm still not at three.
[75:28.11]So it has to be down.
[75:28.87]Is it in the garage?
[75:31.09]Outside?
[75:31.49]Yeah, OK.
[75:32.98]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[75:41.77]One piece.
[75:43.39]Yeah, yo, yeah, yo.
[75:58.33]Behind the house.
[76:02.33]This is clean.
[76:08.63]Oh, it's this stuff.
[76:09.49]Okay.
[76:10.45]Right.
[76:18.40]Three stars.
[76:18.86]Three stars.
[76:19.32]Three stars.
[76:19.78]Give it to me.
[76:22.10]There's not a drop left.
[76:27.64]Come on.
[76:41.63]Come on!
[76:43.46]No, okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[76:44.90]But where is the last little bit?
[76:51.91]Shit!
[76:58.17]Is he, is this bot in the driveway?
[76:59.80]Or the garage?
[77:08.24]Hmm, I don't see anything.
[77:10.89]Let's go upstairs one more time.
[77:17.29]I think there'd be an indicator, right?
[77:23.92]Nothing in here.
[77:24.50]This room looks really good.
[77:32.08]There's nothing in here.
[77:33.94]Not the bathroom.
[77:41.89]Fuck!
[77:49.15]Where is this last thing?
[77:50.51]Oh no.
[78:07.66]It's gotta be in the garage, right?
[78:09.26]It has to be.
[78:09.86]Because everything here is done.
[78:12.38]Yeah, this is all, every one of these are done.
[78:15.55]16, 16, 8, 8.
[78:16.07]Yeah, all this is good here.
[78:20.15]Door across from the closet downstairs.
[78:30.95]Aha!
[78:32.55]There's a watermelon in here.
[78:33.67]Oh, it doesn't matter.
[78:44.52]Now this is done.
[78:47.46]Nothing in here.
[78:51.76]Nothing in here.
[78:53.82]Oh man, there's another bathroom.
[78:55.68]Okay, good.
[78:56.20]This would have been bad if I didn't get it.
[78:57.58]Did that person take a shower?
[79:16.23]Nice.
[79:16.51]That's... Okay, I... Okay.
[79:32.56]So.
[79:32.72]This is like a... I don't know what happened, but somebody's hands were there, and I don't know if they were puking, or if they were looking in the mirror, or I don't know.
[79:48.19]Is this Lloyd's room?
[79:54.39]No, Lloyd needs way more space.
[79:59.36]I would rather have Lloyd sleep in the bedroom.
[80:05.36]No, Lloyd's sleeping in my room.
[80:10.95]He's going to have a huge dog bed.
[80:14.82]It's going to have a bowl with a bone on it that says Lloyd, and it's going to be red.
[80:20.27]Thank you.
[80:33.77]You should sleep in the dog bed.
[80:34.93]Lloyd gets to sleep in the bed.
[80:44.61]Alright, I got 40,000.
[80:46.97]I need that destruction tool.
[80:50.25]Let's just keep going.
[80:50.75]Okay, nothing here.
[80:55.82]Okay, tiny house to flip.
[80:59.06]Wait, any assembly?
[80:59.76]No.
[81:02.80]Okay.
[81:03.60]A little bird told me you're making it big in Pina Cove.
[81:06.74]I saw what you did at Jane's, and I must say I'm impressed.
[81:10.82]That gave me an idea.
[81:12.28]I found this old shack I think could sell well.
[81:15.23]It needs some adjustments, of course.
[81:17.41]I have a client with very specific taste, and nothing on the market seems to make the cut.
[81:21.67]I'm afraid if I don't find her dream house soon, she'll look outside Pina Cove.
[81:26.79]Or worst, she'll buy something from Ascenzo.
[81:31.37]Proper isn't as simple.
[81:32.25]You make the renovation, I make the sale.
[81:34.19]You're ready for your first proper house flip.
[81:38.45]Holy shit.
[81:50.28]Okay, yeah, this looks like a real one.
[81:56.08]Hitting them all today.
[81:56.88]Yeah.
[81:59.26]Well, come on.
[82:00.13]I'm streaming at EU-friendly times.
[82:01.95]EU probably hasn't heard me talk live in like two years when those jokes were relevant.
[82:08.65]So, I'm just trying to keep everybody up to date and make references for the EU crowd.
[82:16.20]We only see them like maybe two or three times, maybe five times a year.
[82:24.11]Gotta pull A. You know what?
[82:26.09]I could stream at like 8, 9, 10 o'clock in the morning and repeat all the material I've ever done.
[82:32.66]And it'll just be new to the EU crowd.
[82:36.54]Damn.
[82:37.16]Okay.
[82:37.38]My king.
[82:49.53]My king.
[82:54.64]Please do a Fortnite stream.
[82:57.92]No, this is not going to be... I'm never playing Fortnite ever again.
[83:01.94]I just have to be very clear with you.
[83:04.99]Although I will say, I was thinking about... I've completely abandoned Twitter, by the way.
[83:10.65]I just don't use it.
[83:12.01]Social media, I don't use it.
[83:13.43]I'm done with it.
[83:14.73]But I was thinking about just saying... And this is all I was going to write.
[83:20.70]And I'm on this kick right now because it's relevant.
[83:23.76]And I wrote, and I was going to say...
[83:27.43]I change my answer.
[83:29.97]Willy Wonka will get into Fortnite before the Three Stooges.
[83:34.66]That was it.
[83:34.98]That's all I was gonna say.
[83:51.69]That's probably accurate.
[83:59.39]lego Fortnite look yeah I just I'm not I don't know I just don't guys I don't play like FPS games that much anymore
[84:11.21]And I don't like BRs.
[84:14.01]I've been very much very vocal about how I'm not a BR guy at all.
[84:19.74]I don't like them.
[84:20.44]I don't like playing them.
[84:21.76]And again, it's not like, oh, what the fuck you, dude?
[84:26.60]No, I'm just terrible at them.
[84:28.48]And in a BR, when there's a hundred people, and you're one of the first nine people to die...
[84:36.03]and the other eight people were eating a sandwich and forgot that they fucking queued, it's not fun.
[84:50.43]It's Survival Ma- It's- No, it's- Wait, what?
[84:52.79]It's different?
[84:53.31]It's not Fortnite?
[84:56.56]Oh, it's different.
[85:00.96]Well, whatever.
[85:03.80]Hey, I'll tell you what my game is.
[85:06.74]My kind of game.
[85:08.80]House Flipper.
[85:11.47]One of my most played games on stream.
[85:13.93]And look at this.
[85:15.15]This is... This is so fucking awesome.
[85:21.07]I get to clean, pick up trash, break walls, build, like, fucking houses and make, like, little fun things.
[85:28.90]Look at, like, hamster statues.
[85:30.62]This is way my speed.
[85:31.98]This is way more than I... I care more about this than anything else.
[85:56.89]TF2 Youth to House Slipper Retirement.
[86:00.57]Ah, I wouldn't have it any other way.
[86:04.50]I love this game.
[86:05.90]I love this franchise.
[86:07.42]I love just clicking stuff and moving tables around and like taking walls down and building like custom stuff.
[86:15.14]Yep.
[86:17.54]No other game has to release.
[86:19.72]I'm happy.
[86:20.22]I'm content.
[86:34.78]Is that all the trash on the front kind of deck area?
[86:37.84]I believe.
[86:47.94]gonna play this again on stream after a mega gaming weekend uh probably if I just if I feel like it again remember we're going on a new policy into the next you know period however long whatever I'm not gonna give it a time period I'm just saying this is the new period streams are gonna just gonna happen when I feel like doing them and if I feel like playing House Flipper and turning on my stream then you are gonna see it yes
[87:15.64]All this has to go.
[87:16.62]This is all old.
[87:42.45]Stop getting older and having a life.
[87:48.19]Alright.
[87:52.66]These are staying, apparently.
[87:53.60]Ooh, we get to clean windows.
[88:17.92]If you... Hold on, I want to read this.
[88:21.14]If you cared about us, you would have stopped aging in 2013.
[88:23.94]Yeah, I... Yeah, I'm sorry, guys.
[88:28.30]I just kind of... He's getting older.
[88:39.67]He doesn't fucking care about us.
[88:43.95]If you cared, you would have stopped.
[88:47.90]I wouldn't have done any more, uh, age patches.
[88:54.34]Yeah, I don't like these new age patches.
[88:57.22]Like, I don't know, I wish, can he revert?
[89:10.93]Sorry, guys.
[89:13.21]There's no patches for real life.
[89:26.85]Disconnect from the Wi-Fi so you can't be patched anymore.
[89:38.31]I'm going to find the Fountain of Youth.
[89:40.69]Well, here's the thing.
[89:44.03]I don't want to do this forever.
[89:45.13]What the fuck?
[89:46.63]No.
[89:46.89]No.
[89:59.18]Turn off the auto updates.
[90:02.50]I don't know, man.
[90:03.96]After 100 years, I think I'd probably be like, oh, I don't think I'm done.
[90:08.52]I'm pleased I'm leaving.
[90:10.50]This is actually really cool.
[90:27.19]This is cool.
[90:31.82]You can have so much fun up here.
[90:33.59]So much space.
[90:35.27]Can you imagine just putting an easel right here?
[90:44.59]And just breathing in this beach air.
[90:46.48]Just painting this.
[90:52.24]Every day.
[90:57.12]What's your favorite new feature in the game compared to the first one?
[91:00.63]The sandbox mode.
[91:01.93]The sandbox mode is everything that I... I mean, if you watched the stream a couple days ago.
[91:09.12]Sandbox mode is everything I've ever wanted to be in a game like this.
[91:13.70]House Slipper 1 was awesome.
[91:15.98]But there was limitations on House Slipper 1 where you couldn't like from scratch build a house, anything you wanted.
[91:23.05]They did a bunch of expansions and one of the expansions allowed you to build new walls and some new kind of walls and stuff like that.
[91:30.17]You could build out the house in a couple of those patches.
[91:33.31]But.
[91:36.11]just being able to just go into Sandbox and have no limitations and just do whatever you want is, I mean, I know spoilers, but look at what Joel made.
[91:45.30]That's awesome that you can do that.
[91:48.58]The fact, because here's the thing, it would have been really simple to be like, nah, put a cap on it.
[91:53.08]Put a cap on that.
[91:54.47]There are some caps.
[91:55.51]There are caps in Sandbox mode, I think a little, a few of them.
[91:58.77]But Joel being able to do what he did
[92:02.80]It's just there.
[92:03.56]That's really cool that you can even do that.
[92:05.20]That that's like I'm imagining what people will do with that without without those limitations.
[92:10.17]I guess is the point.
[92:15.15]If I get this, uh, you owe me $100,000,000.
[92:17.85]I missed it on purpose.
[92:21.07]I don't think anybody should ever have to pay me that much money.
[92:25.51]If I get this one.
[92:27.01]Then I'm a I'm a sweet cool dude.
[92:32.06]Whoops.
[92:40.19]This is trash, technically.
[92:41.39]That one was even more off.
[92:54.25]I would not want... This is giving me anxiety just doing that.
[92:56.67]That's... I wouldn't be able to do that.
[93:03.06]Because there's a lot of glass you can walk on like this, but this is kind of just a sky window.
[93:07.31]This would freak me out.
[93:09.69]Just... You have like a contractor over your house.
[93:25.83]You look up, and there's a guy with a fucking, like, like a fucking infomercial vacuum, just jumping, trying to stomp through the window.
[93:34.30]Like, what are you, stop, what are you doing?
[93:36.18]Stop doing this!
[93:48.52]What's your go-to flipping method?
[93:50.20]Do you clean, then decorate?
[93:51.48]I like to have a clean slate, completely.
[93:54.26]Everything is clean.
[93:56.73]Because if I don't clean everything first, then it makes me angry when I go to the next room and it's a mess.
[94:06.00]Everything has to be cleaned.
[94:09.16]Then we go for it.
[94:10.02]We're almost there.
[94:25.09]Okay.
[94:26.66]This is... Where's the last... Oh, here we go.
[94:29.66]Right here.
[94:46.25]Hold on.
[94:46.51]I gotta do this.
[94:55.18]I just had to hear those back-to-back.
[95:03.18]And you make a Minecraft house in this game.
[95:04.84]You can make anything.
[95:05.93]You can make anything.
[95:08.09]Look at what Natalix and Kryken did.
[95:09.33]Look at what Squeaks did.
[95:12.39]Look at what RT and Keyword did.
[95:15.69]Yeah, like Ludwig at Dug Dug.
[95:19.11]There's... Like the Snuffy's house.
[95:22.83]You remember that?
[95:24.91]Remember that one?
[95:26.85]Will's house.
[95:27.45]Remember that one?
[95:29.43]I'm not a cool fucking dude, apparently.
[95:31.31]Holy shit.
[95:33.59]Alright.
[95:33.95]If I get this, I am cool.
[95:36.81]If I miss this, then I suck.
[95:41.29]Thank God.
[95:53.62]I think Coolsville sucks.
[96:10.91]It's dirty.
[96:13.85]Now it's kind of weathered.
[96:14.99]Just weathered.
[96:21.86]What is going on in there?
[96:22.76]Is there a board in front of that?
[96:29.67]I just haven't gone in here.
[96:30.39]Oh.
[96:33.77]Yowzers.
[96:46.76]I haven't got a level up point in a little while.
[96:48.28]I guess it's spreading out.
[96:57.71]Jeremy, you just walked in this room and immediately forgot.
[97:01.33]No, a World of Warcraft NPC walked in here and was not activated in this zone.
[97:13.18]Guys, I level one rabid wolf from fucking Northshire Abbey walked into here.
[97:21.06]It's different.
[97:22.03]I didn't actually walk in here.
[97:26.50]Making a lot of WoW references lately.
[97:53.33]I'm reading chat.
[97:54.51]Okay, everyone thought I was just being weird.
[97:55.93]I was reading chat holding the button down.
[97:57.67]Remember, I read chat.
[98:00.19]So, okay, if I'm going... If I'm looking over to the monitor where you guys are, I'm not looking at the screen.
[98:05.74]I can't be... I don't have four eyes.
[98:12.03]The WoW fixation has returned.
[98:14.80]I'll tell you what I actually am interested in.
[98:16.54]I want to see how the Only Fangs handles the hardcore WoW raid today.
[98:25.12]I actually am going to watch that.
[98:26.86]That's going to be interesting.
[98:31.80]It's hardcore, so it's permadeath.
[98:34.72]It's taken him like weeks and weeks to level up.
[98:38.39]I have no idea what's going to happen.
[98:41.16]They're doing a raid.
[98:43.08]One of like the first really kind of raids in WoW.
[98:45.76]And if you die, you're dead forever.
[98:47.36]I have no idea what's going to happen.
[98:53.98]I'm definitely going to watch it though.
[98:59.78]Happy Saturday.
[99:00.44]Happy Saturday.
[99:01.40]To you too.
[99:04.73]Wherever you are.
[99:12.62]It's a big one.
[99:13.04]I wonder, I don't know what happened to my, um, the sound file.
[99:17.79]I feel like I heard it do it once before.
[99:22.47]Maybe I bugged it out.
[99:28.80]Damn, this is, that took multiple tracks of the mousepad, damn.
[99:40.87]I need new walls for sure.
[99:43.73]I kind of like this place.
[99:47.89]Got a lot.
[99:50.69]Actually, I really like this place.
[100:06.60]Clean, clean, clean.
[100:08.18]Ooh, nice.
[100:23.87]There's no way this dump has internet.
[100:27.99]Dude.
[100:32.19]Yeah, why not?
[100:37.73]Why not?
[100:42.59]There's no way this dump.
[100:46.04]Yeah, we'll see if you call it a dump in 20 minutes.
[101:05.81]Is a plank still on the door?
[101:07.09]I love that it doesn't matter what the game is.
[101:14.07]Everything is backseatable.
[101:15.81]It doesn't matter.
[101:18.50]That's so funny.
[101:22.16]Everything is backseatable.
[101:25.48]I could be brushing my teeth on camera.
[101:28.80]And somebody in this chat would say, you know, according to the American Dental Association, you need to brush your top and bottom for at least two minutes.
[101:35.25]That was one minute and 45 seconds.
[101:39.15]Skill issue.
[101:39.67]I think it's clean.
[101:46.47]One window or is it this one?
[101:51.07]Where's the dirty window?
[101:56.91]Oh, that was OK.
[101:57.67]That was like blending in.
[102:05.69]Charge your toothbrush.
[102:06.65]Alright, I think we're clean.
[102:11.75]No, not quite.
[102:12.77]Everything needs to be clean.
[102:24.30]No more trash out here.
[102:25.10]Wait.
[102:36.47]You could never blend in.
[102:37.43]I can blend in.
[102:39.47]I think this is like a fun misconception, I think, in this community.
[102:46.57]Where, like, in my regular life, I, like, do the, quote, jermaWalk at the grocery store.
[102:54.27]Guys.
[102:55.71]I am the most, like, plain fucking person you could possibly imagine.
[103:04.22]I just... I'm pretty boring in my kind of daily life.
[103:09.90]I don't really... I had nothing really that excite... I'm just kind of like live... and work.
[103:16.80]I work on like projects, streaming and take care of Otto and you know, Holly and eating stuff, doing some stuff sometimes, you know, chores.
[103:33.38]I'm not, like, contacting aliens on my roof.
[103:37.86]There's a misconception here.
[103:40.23]Oh, shit.
[103:44.85]White paint is what client wants.
[103:49.14]You got it.
[104:03.02]Sounds like something an alien would say.
[104:05.42]We talked about that yesterday.
[104:07.78]That was great.
[104:41.52]And it's nice.
[104:43.20]Because Gonzo doesn't... Well, go watch the movie.
[104:47.28]It's like, you know, Kermit the Frog.
[104:49.81]Miss Piggy.
[104:51.33]Fozzie Bear.
[104:53.67]Like, Gonzo.
[104:54.49]Who's Gonzo?
[104:56.29]What's Gonzo?
[105:01.15]That movie is very sweet.
[105:03.24]It's a very sweet movie.
[105:20.53]Hmm.
[105:24.11]Good.
[105:27.37]Is that required reading?
[105:29.99]Yeah, you can add it to the syllabus.
[105:33.29]The current syllabus to watch any of my content ever.
[105:38.80]I'm not sure if you've passed around the syllabus or not, but this is important.
[105:43.06]It's every single Ernest movie.
[105:45.38]All of them.
[105:46.90]I'm talking about all like 12 of them.
[105:49.04]Every single Ernest movie.
[105:51.69]Gremlins 2 and Gremlins 1.
[105:57.61]I'd say like the majority of the Merry Melodies catalog.
[106:01.75]Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, that kind of stuff.
[106:03.29]That's required reading.
[106:04.01]What are some other ones?
[106:14.75]Well, I've said a couple others too.
[106:15.95]What are the other required ones?
[106:21.13]The mask, yep.
[106:22.13]Mask is very important.
[106:24.41]That's required reading.
[106:25.99]Not The Mask 2.
[106:28.87]But I would say the one part of The Mask 2 that I think is actually very underrated and people don't... It's like my... I watched this part of the movie so many times.
[106:40.42]Is when it's the... You're just going to be true.
[106:43.47]Kicking the ass off of you.
[106:44.75]I'm going to do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[106:47.95]I've watched that part of The Mask, Son of the Mask, probably like 50 times at least.
[106:58.27]Not that I don't like the scene, I just have to watch it at least a few times every few years.
[107:03.60]There's something about that scene that just hits so, so differently.
[107:10.16]It's just, what is happening?
[107:11.28]Why are we doing this?
[107:16.23]I love the dancing.
[107:20.77]It's just something, it's just something about it is so strange.
[107:27.59]That movie was fucked.
[107:28.91]Yeah.
[107:30.59]It was just so, like, over-the-top bizarre and, like, not funny and, like, kind of bad, but, like, really bad.
[107:40.66]But still, like, some of it was, like, kind of just weirdly charming because it was so odd and so awful.
[107:47.12]I don't know.
[107:48.28]It's hard to describe, but...
[107:54.14]The mask one, though, is one of my favorite movies ever.
[107:56.37]Alright, we got this one done.
[108:00.47]Keeping these walls, though?
[108:01.59]Really?
[108:01.93]No.
[108:04.05]I guess that's okay.
[108:04.91]Are we painting anything in here?
[108:14.96]No painting in here.
[108:15.80]Just a lot of decoration.
[108:16.95]Okay, this is probably, what, kitchen?
[108:19.29]This is bathroom.
[108:21.36]So this is like kitchen area?
[108:23.36]Bed area?
[108:27.08]What needs to go out here?
[108:27.76]Just a couple of chairs.
[108:38.29]I wish I could just put them here.
[108:39.09]Yeah, this is fine.
[108:43.71]Put them like right here.
[108:45.57]There.
[108:48.18]Right here.
[108:49.88]Ah.
[108:56.91]Like, right over here?
[108:58.31]Let's put some stuff over there.
[108:59.35]Don't forget about Saw.
[109:07.75]Saw 10 might actually be required reading.
[109:12.94]Just because.
[109:14.24]Don't anybody talk about that movie.
[109:16.14]Don't talk about that movie.
[109:21.12]Don't nobody say anything.
[109:22.70]But I think Saw 10 may end up being required reading.
[109:31.36]For one specific, very, very, very specific reason.
[109:36.17]Nobody talk.
[109:40.99]Good.
[109:55.97]Looks good.
[109:56.31]Alright, now let's do furniture.
[109:58.79]It's time, time, time, time.
[109:59.93]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[110:07.22]You do... Okay, you want cool wood.
[110:13.76]And you want cool wood here.
[110:17.49]I understand.
[110:18.01]I feel it.
[110:18.47]I feel the philosophy.
[110:19.23]Okay.
[110:33.50]Let me do this real quick.
[110:34.44]I wonder if this is.
[110:45.68]Yeah, I think it's a little better.
[110:51.63]I am, so the reason why it's a different FOV right now, why I had it at 80, 85, is because I am, I'm looking at it on a TV.
[111:00.59]I'm not playing on a monitor.
[111:02.59]So, just trying to get it to the point where I can be comfortable and have you guys not want to puke too, right?
[111:22.25]Cool.
[111:24.35]Got a point.
[111:26.19]I have a... Holy shit, I have a lot of points.
[111:27.95]Did I not... Did I not pay attention to this?
[111:30.40]What was I doing?
[111:32.70]Cleaning spray.
[111:33.42]Cleaning spray is added to your flipper arsenal.
[111:39.78]Clear trash from bigger area with your newly invented grabbing technique.
[111:45.81]Ah, so you can get it from more.
[111:46.91]Okay, cool.
[111:49.16]Roller uses even less paint.
[111:50.81]You hardly need to reach for the can.
[111:52.47]Cool.
[111:54.69]More tiles at once.
[111:55.91]You can copy item style or any surface finish.
[112:04.29]Make sure that your carpets match your table.
[112:08.23]Cool.
[112:11.78]Nice.

[112:19.55]Yeah, it's a skill tree.
[112:25.72]Come on.

[112:30.32]Hmm.
[112:31.44]Warrior?
[112:34.76]Priest?
[112:38.80]Uh... Yeah.
[112:41.10]Priest?
[112:41.66]Priest?
[112:45.44]Hmm...
[112:47.92]Yeah, this is like healer.
[112:51.70]DPS.
[113:00.14]Crash is the tank.
[113:02.75]That's not a bad way to put it, yeah.
[113:06.79]Caster for the hands.
[113:08.91]This is like mage DPS.
[113:11.03]Caster DPS.
[113:16.78]This is rogue.
[113:20.59]That's -2 farming.
[113:28.91]Yeah.
[113:32.78]Yin and yang, man.
[113:39.56]If everything is good, then you won't appreciate it.
[113:44.42]Some things need to be bad so you appreciate the good.
[113:49.12]Get it?
[113:58.49]They don't get it.
[113:59.09]They don't get it.
[113:59.65]Mods, just start banning people.
[114:00.67]They don't get it.
[114:03.16]They don't get it.
[114:03.56]Just start banning people.
[114:04.94]By the tens of thousands.
[114:07.10]They don't get it.
[114:07.50]Alright, let me see.
[114:15.12]Coffee table.
[114:16.40]There's a lot of items I have to really pay attention here.
[114:18.18]Hold on.
[114:21.89]Cabinet.
[114:22.91]Let's get the big stuff in first.
[114:24.97]Bookcase.
[114:25.19]Bookcase.
[114:29.48]you watch all of one piece um I would love to watch all of one piece and and go read all the manga unfortunately I realistically only have like 40 to 60 years left to live and if I started now I think it would take me too long I didn't start early enough
[115:07.69]Cabinet.
[115:08.15]This is a cab.
[115:08.77]Okay, this is gonna go like here.
[115:10.67]I just want to get it in the room first, right?
[115:14.20]We'll figure it out later.
[115:23.64]Don't leave those cabinets.
[115:25.82]Why?
[115:26.14]I think it wants... No, it wants... The game wants them in here.
[115:33.49]Yeah, I was not told to remove those.
[115:36.09]Client told me to keep these.
[115:41.94]Are you going to watch the new Wonka movie?
[115:43.40]Yeah, I will.
[115:44.12]I mean, I love the Gene Wilder one.
[115:45.88]That's probably one of my favorite movies too.
[115:53.24]I think I watched like 30 minutes of the Tim Burton one and I turned it off.
[115:58.76]I was just like, it's not for me.
[115:59.69]I don't really like it.
[116:02.53]I get where they're going with it, but it wasn't for me.
[116:07.41]I was just like, no, it's not for me.
[116:14.45]I think it's just Gene Wilder is one of those actors.
[116:20.58]The way that Gene Wilder played Willy Wonka was... I don't even know.
[116:28.48]He just is Willy Wonka.
[116:38.08]He was so good.
[116:39.06]He was so funny.
[116:39.90]His delivery is so perfect in everything he did.
[116:44.89]Just a true, like, legend of timing and being able to take direction and ad-libbing.
[116:52.48]Gene Wilder is just phenomenal.
[116:56.26]And if you have not seen any of Gene Wilder's movies, especially Willy Wonka, I highly recommend them.
[117:09.16]One of the greats to ever do it.
[117:13.20]Alright, where are we going?
[117:15.57]Have you seen Young Frankenstein?
[117:16.79]Of course.
[117:17.09]100%, yeah.
[117:17.83]You should do a movie tier list stream.
[117:29.32]Um, I don't know about that.
[117:30.63]I'm very, very low lift when it comes to movies.
[117:35.61]There's only like a few that I really care that much about, genuinely.
[117:40.99]I don't really...
[117:44.49]I'm not a movie kind of critic kind of guy.
[117:47.26]I like the stuff I like and don't really care about the stuff I don't.
[118:06.67]You know what I've been on?
[118:07.31]I've been on a kick, though, recently.
[118:09.37]Um, a lot of the... So, YouTube has... YouTube has just those free movies with ads.
[118:17.86]And they've got some... They've got some really interesting shit up there.
[118:21.88]Just really interesting stuff that... Just wait a minute.
[118:24.58]This movie does exist.
[118:31.36]I've been on such a kick of just grabbing a random...
[118:35.24]Old, like 2006 animated movie and just putting it on.
[118:41.37]Or some old movie that you forgot existed.
[118:43.51]You're like, wait a minute, that's right.
[118:45.81]I forgot that this movie came out like 12, 13, 14, 15 years ago.
[118:49.41]I'm going to watch it.
[118:50.03]Why not?
[118:50.31]There's a reason those movies are free.
[118:57.34]Yeah, but whatever, just throw them on.
[119:02.52]It's because there's no pressure at all for me there.
[119:06.43]I don't know what the difference is.
[119:07.71]When I'm on a, like one of the other stream, like a streaming platform and it's like, what do I want to watch today?
[119:13.04]It almost feels like there's some kind of stakes for what I'm going to pick.
[119:17.54]When I open up the, like the YouTube movie, just free movies shit, I don't care at all.
[119:22.35]I don't, I do not fucking care.
[119:25.03]I'm just going to put, I'm going to pick a random one.
[119:26.65]I don't care.
[119:27.37]It's going to go on.
[119:29.09]I don't know why that it is like that.
[119:32.49]How come I'm so easy to put on something there, but not on one of the streaming platforms?
[119:37.21]Uh, I don't know why I do it.
[119:51.34]This is a very wood house.
[119:59.67]Because it just kind of feels like another YouTube video that you can click off if you're bored.
[120:02.45]That's true.
[120:03.55]That is a good point.
[120:08.96]What is this?
[120:09.84]Okay.
[120:11.54]Drying rack?
[120:17.10]Where should I put the drying rack?
[120:20.01]Oh, this is for dishes.
[120:21.43]I thought it was for towels.
[120:29.27]Okay, well, if this is a wood house, then I'm making... It's gonna be a wood seat.
[120:55.89]I think that's... I think that works.
[121:04.45]It's more like stone, but still.
[121:09.17]Everything will be brown.
[121:20.47]It's coming together, I like it.
[121:27.90]I need to rearrange this though, because this is not working.
[121:31.56]This is a very small space.
[121:35.87]I'll put those back later, but the fridge has to go in the... It has to go here, right?
[121:41.48]That's the only logical place I would put the fridge.
[121:43.72]Or over here.
[121:46.14]And I have to pee, so be right back.
[121:49.47]See you in like two, three minutes.
[125:58.44]Hello, everybody.
[126:01.85]I have returned.
[126:07.95]He went to go watch that one scene from The Mask again.
[126:12.75]Good one.
[126:15.27]It's a good one.
[126:15.97]Okay.
[126:24.41]What were we doing?
[126:35.98]Play the Hell's Kitchen sting every time you come back.
[126:41.43]I don't want to like.
[126:43.35]That would be kind of painful.
[126:44.67]Alright, sink cabinet.
[126:59.39]What do I want this?
[127:10.63]This has an issue with here.
[127:11.71]I can take that off.
[127:15.03]I can just shave this down.
[127:17.92]I'm going to shave that down.
[127:19.52]Oh, I can't.
[127:20.04]I haven't unlocked the tool yet.
[127:23.02]Hmm, okay.
[127:26.76]So then... Okay.
[127:34.81]Okay.
[127:42.53]Oh, alright, wait.
[127:58.64]You like candy corn?
[128:00.52]Um... No.
[128:03.99]I don't like it there either.
[128:09.69]Shit.
[128:13.81]But I don't like it there either.
[128:15.09]Let's put the fridge on the porch.
[128:24.37]Alright, here are the hanging cabinets.
[128:43.75]And then two more of these.
[128:44.93]Can I fit them here?
[128:53.09]Hmm.
[129:16.37]It needs to be flush across the whole thing.
[129:18.49]Can I put something else here, like hang something?
[129:38.05]Another hanging cabinet?
[129:41.53]Uh oh, wait a minute.
[129:44.53]Another hanging cabinet.
[129:55.37]Uh, okay.
[129:56.07]I think I understand what's going on.
[129:59.51]Um, just give me a second.
[130:01.54]Alright.
[130:01.92]I got it.
[130:02.22]This is like a puzzle piece.
[130:03.70]These are puzzles.
[130:20.92]Just need another corner piece.
[130:21.96]I don't think... I guess I could just put one there.
[130:25.40]Yeah, you know what?
[130:33.10]I'm... Yeah.
[130:34.81]Hold on a second.
[130:36.79]Get this out of the way.
[130:38.65]They don't all have to be in the kitchen.
[130:40.17]Why am I putting every single one of them here?
[130:41.87]There's not very much space to put it anywhere else.
[130:58.15]Okay.
[130:59.69]That's alright.
[131:00.03]I'm going to swap these ones though.
[131:01.66]I like this right above the sink.
[131:08.94]There we go.
[131:09.56]Hey, Lloyd.
[131:11.51]I did it.
[131:19.41]We must be sleeping.
[131:30.25]Alright, so what about these ones then?
[131:31.71]Because this is not, you can't block that.
[131:36.57]Is that, is that terrible?
[131:37.79]Because this is, this is, I can't put anything here.
[131:43.80]Other side.
[131:46.22]Ah, yeah, I could do that.
[131:49.44]But then it's blocking this.
[131:52.40]Yeah, hold on, something up here.
[131:53.40]Get this out of the way.
[132:02.01]Oops.
[132:05.69]I can't sell it.
[132:08.31]Put the corner piece in the other corner.
[132:19.20]I'm just moving it out of the way.
[132:20.16]I know people are freaking out right now.
[132:24.52]I'm just... I'm moving it.
[132:26.07]I'm moving it.
[132:27.37]I'm moving... That's not where it's going.
[132:43.27]Maybe I'll just keep it there.
[132:45.26]Whatever.
[132:45.66]Okay.
[133:02.79]Come on!
[133:04.19]Yeah!
[133:11.57]Shit!
[133:25.28]I guess it's OK.
[133:31.76]It's just it's going over this lip and it's that I don't like that.
[133:35.92]You can press tab for a layout hint.
[133:44.49]I can.
[133:50.75]The fridge.
[134:06.59]It's too tall?
[134:07.33]Hey, you're not a fridge guy.
[134:15.71]Small cabinet on top of the fridge.
[134:18.68]Now, I think you might be cooking there.
[134:33.95]Ah, if only the fridge was a little bit taller.
[134:47.26]Hold on, wait.
[134:51.23]No, no, no.
[134:52.71]Whatever.
[134:53.19]It's okay.
[134:53.81]Whatever, whatever.
[134:54.59]It's fine.
[134:55.13]It's fine.
[134:55.45]It's fine.
[134:56.55]It functions.
[135:02.31]Good.
[135:08.07]Sideways fridge.
[135:10.21]I mean, I guess I could... Over there and put the stove...
[135:18.82]I think it's alright.
[135:26.30]Okay.
[135:27.70]Okay.
[135:28.78]I don't want to start putting figurines out yet.
[135:30.93]But I'll get that out.
[135:32.29]I need infrastructure.
[135:34.59]A desk goes in here too.
[135:37.63]I would say the desk goes over here.
[135:49.56]The shelf office chair.
[135:51.18]Yeah, right here.
[135:59.50]Desk organizer.
[136:00.62]Oh.
[136:02.20]Another shelf.
[136:09.89]Which.
[136:13.51]And I have to put it.
[136:16.85]Here.
[136:20.35]Oh, but I'm not done.
[136:22.13]So where is this going to go?
[136:23.25]Drawing rack.
[136:25.83]This is an outlier.
[136:27.30]Where does this go?
[136:38.87]The desk needs pizza slices.
[136:41.29]I'll put them there.
[136:41.73]Don't worry.
[136:46.98]Support beam for the shelf.
[136:49.34]I think this is where the weight is being loaded, so put it there.
[136:51.66]Just to give the extra support with the screws.
[136:57.23]I know what this is.
[136:58.25]Oh my God, guys.
[136:59.29]I'm just... Holy shit.
[137:00.91]Look at the chat.
[137:01.33]Look at this.
[137:02.51]Look at the chat.
[137:03.45]Look at the chat.
[137:04.97]You think I really was going to do that?
[137:06.64]Look at the chat.
[137:08.14]Come on.
[137:09.26]Guys.
[137:09.44]Guys.
[137:15.98]To me, this is like I want to put my keys down and stuff.
[137:18.43]But I guess that this fulfills that too.
[137:21.89]Go over here.
[137:22.93]Here.
[137:25.71]That's not terrible.
[137:32.18]I don't hate that.
[137:32.86]I think it looks fine.
[137:49.18]Nice.
[137:52.71]The house is crowded?
[137:56.49]I don't think so.
[137:57.89]I think this is... I think this looks good.
[138:00.53]This is the only thing I don't like.
[138:03.77]But I think it wants... I think they want me to put it here.
[138:11.42]Let me try something.
[138:12.10]Hold on.
[138:15.62]Because these are little.
[138:16.72]These can be moved around.
[138:23.20]Hold on, wait, what?
[138:26.41]Oh, I had this the other way.
[138:29.25]This fridge placement is an affront to God.
[138:44.21]If the corner goes in that corner.
[138:50.30]And then one of the little pieces can go on this side.
[138:55.71]Bridge goes here.
[138:59.03]Stove right here.
[139:04.55]Sink right there.
[139:09.04]Bingo.
[139:11.20]Yes!
[139:12.10]Nice.
[139:12.34]Okay, that's perfect.
[139:14.68]Hooray!
[139:15.02]I did it.
[139:23.58]This is one star.
[139:25.30]We'll get there.
[139:25.72]Alright, what else do you want in here?
[139:30.91]Oh, you want a towel?
[139:32.23]That makes sense.
[139:35.59]Put it on the towel rack?
[139:39.74]No?
[139:41.36]No?
[139:43.10]Yeah?
[139:43.22]No?
[139:47.52]No?
[139:53.15]Where does it go?
[139:54.07]It's an oven rack.
[139:59.47]Oh.
[139:59.53]I thought it was like a dish rag.
[140:05.84]Now we just gotta do detail and figurines and we're good.
[140:09.68]Which is for over here.
[140:22.09]Plant pot.
[140:23.89]Plant's going to go.
[140:24.81]Be right up here.
[140:27.71]In this corner.
[140:30.52]Oh, that's why you see this is too small.
[140:32.54]Right here.
[140:35.28]On the desk now.
[140:35.94]Too close.
[140:42.84]Cute.
[140:52.47]Haha.
[140:54.87]Table lamp.
[141:01.82]Is this for aesthetic or is this for function?
[141:05.66]Because there are lights in this house.
[141:07.18]I think it's just for aesthetic.
[141:10.65]So I'm going to put it where?
[141:12.57]I don't know.
[141:12.99]Like over here?
[141:26.01]Bread bin.
[141:26.45]Get this bowl out of the way.
[141:47.68]Cool.
[141:49.42]I did it!
[141:51.88]I actually did a room!
[141:53.12]I completed a room!
[142:00.76]Remember how awful this was before?
[142:02.08]Looks good now.
[142:06.11]Okay, bathroom time.
[142:09.49]Uh, shower.
[142:10.11]I mean, the spot is just right here for it.
[142:15.96]Yep.
[142:17.02]Very good.
[142:20.05]Toilet.
[142:25.54]I I don't I don't use the toilet.
[142:27.52]I just I just go outside like nature intended So I could use this as like a chin-up bar that makes much sense to me.
[142:33.44]I think Sink here How high or low should a sink really be here I
[142:55.42]What about Lloyd?
[142:56.10]Yeah, Lloyd.
[143:02.05]This needs to be lower.
[143:02.87]I think that's fine.
[143:12.70]Oh, this is towel.
[143:13.94]Okay, towel rack.
[143:20.50]I need to sell something.
[143:21.22]What am I selling in here?
[143:22.14]Oh, these.
[143:23.52]Okay, good.
[143:25.15]Bathroom is done.
[143:29.45]In all actuality, where would I really want this?
[143:33.91]Where does this really go?
[143:35.47]I guess, like, maybe... These?
[143:39.51]Oh, no.
[143:40.77]Why would you have a mirror?
[143:44.43]When you've got one of the best views in the world.
[143:57.62]Imagine washing your hands with that every day.
[143:59.26]I just like smashed my teeth.
[144:02.39]I think that's good.
[144:22.78]It's a P mirror.
[144:24.42]I don't know why that's there.
[144:25.40]Hold on.
[144:31.41]either.
[144:32.45]This is just like fucking weird.
[144:33.97]Wait a second.
[144:42.86]Hold on.
[144:43.36]If somebody was out here walking by, they wouldn't be able to see the mirror and see me in the bathroom taking a shit in the mirror, right?
[144:53.39]What are the angles like here?
[144:54.51]We're changing that.
[145:03.68]That's fine.
[145:11.03]What do you want outside?
[145:11.77]Oh, I'm going to get rid of that stuff.
[145:17.11]I thought this would look nice.
[145:19.83]Never mind.
[145:25.33]Like the trimming, right?
[145:31.43]Wait, where is it?
[145:33.07]Isn't it right on the front?
[145:34.13]Or is it upstairs?
[145:41.22]Yeah, there it is.
[145:46.42]Ooh, lots of plants.
[145:50.58]I'll do this last.
[145:54.47]This has got to move.
[146:26.40]Okay.
[146:27.26]That gives more room.
[146:29.60]Or... Do you want to sell the sticks?
[146:34.99]Oh, shit.
[146:35.39]Okay.
[146:38.57]Sell the rock?
[146:42.61]Sell the tree?
[146:45.92]Really?
[146:46.18]I like this.
[146:46.94]I don't want to get rid of that.
[146:49.78]I guess I am.
[146:50.34]Okay.
[146:50.44]Okay.
[146:54.14]There's still a stain somewhere.
[146:55.46]I have no idea where the hell... Ooh!
[147:06.95]I have a spray.
[147:07.63]Alright, stain.
[147:20.79]Where is it?
[147:23.05]This is gonna be so hard to find.
[147:26.13]No, it isn't.
[147:30.27]It was more than that?
[147:31.01]Oh, right here.
[147:40.58]That's good.
[147:41.04]Everything is ready except for now just the bathroom's done.
[147:46.20]Bedroom is up next.
[147:51.91]I'll get the bed in here first.
[148:05.64]I think that makes sense.
[148:06.54]I guess I could go this way too.
[148:08.08]I could spin it.
[148:16.71]That leaves room for more, but... Hmm.
[148:21.71]Dude, your bathroom is awful.
[148:23.09]My bathroom is fine.
[148:35.35]What do you think, like that or like this?
[148:50.92]I can see the arguments for both, but I feel like if it was me, I would want this.
[148:56.09]I just feel like there's more room to move around now.
[149:00.31]For some reason.
[149:03.87]Alright, the dresser.
[149:12.61]Shit.
[149:30.72]Wait, I need tables.
[149:31.86]I need to get the furniture in here first.
[149:41.04]Is it more than one nightstand I need or just one?
[149:44.96]The world map?
[149:46.55]What the fuck?
[149:53.17]Well, there's only one place that can go and it's against that wall.
[150:12.87]On the windowsill, I guess.
[150:24.95]Oops, there we go.
[150:25.75]Bye.
[150:25.97]Need another one.
[150:37.04]Another one.
[150:42.21]Another one?
[150:42.67]Another one?
[151:17.29]Yeah!
[151:19.15]Looks good.
[151:29.03]Oops.
[151:43.87]Oops.
[151:45.67]That really looks good to you?
[151:47.15]Hey, design is subjective.
[151:55.50]If you like, you know, green, blue, and orange, what if I like red?
[152:03.72]At a backwards nightstand.
[152:05.87]We're different people, okay?
[152:12.61]Just the roof.
[152:20.08]Perfect.
[152:28.84]Now this is just all plants, I think.
[152:31.72]Sunbed.
[152:37.44]I love this so much.
[152:39.12]I would love to live here.
[152:40.60]I love the sun just hitting me in the face.
[152:42.38]I love just baking in the sun.
[152:46.15]I actually would be afraid to live here because I would, on the first day I move in, be like, yes, finally, just I get to be on the roof and just lie in the sun.
[152:55.03]And I think I would die on the first day because I would just lie here and be like, yeah, and then I would just fall asleep and just die.
[153:25.39]I'm going to keep it.
[153:27.59]We want a shade.
[153:28.93]We want to shade our feet.
[153:31.07]That's it.
[153:31.67]Nothing else.
[153:33.67]I want my legs down to be completely like transparently white.
[153:41.66]And I want the other half to be like a tan.
[153:44.60]He's going to have permanent sock tan.
[153:57.35]Alright, plants go with like.
[154:01.71]How many do I need?
[154:02.17]6, 7, OK, 11 of these.
[154:03.59]1, 2.
[154:03.63]3.
[154:03.65]4.
[154:03.67]5.
[154:03.69]6.
[154:03.71]7.
[154:03.73]8.
[154:03.75]9.
[154:03.77]Uh oh, it's not the exact amount.
[154:30.62]One, two, three.
[154:37.93]Five, six.
[154:42.63]I need three more.
[154:43.29]Okay.
[154:44.09]Well, now let me move it.
[154:59.56]Sweet.
[155:04.52]Sweet.
[155:08.44]One, two.
[155:08.86]Oh, okay.
[155:09.34]So there is three.
[155:17.50]Cool.
[155:18.92]Now we need a table.
[155:23.45]I did it.
[155:25.63]You gonna play sandbox mode?
[155:27.71]Yeah, I think what, so tomorrow, when I stream this tomorrow, tomorrow is, I think, just the absolute, just total fuckface day.
[155:35.87]I wanted to really play the game and see, like, the campaign and stuff, but tomorrow, I think, is the fuckface day.
[155:40.97]We'll just spend, like, a few hours just making something ridiculous.
[155:48.50]But I really was interested in the game.
[155:56.01]Shattered.
[155:59.64]Well, that's a problem.
[156:01.82]This looks bad.
[156:02.72]Yeah, yeah.
[156:08.40]Why?
[156:10.48]If you walked into this house... Is the first thing you say gonna go... This is bad.
[156:18.85]Bad design.
[156:20.85]What's gonna happen is the person is going to turn you around.
[156:22.99]They say, oh, turn around, please.
[156:23.75]You have to turn.
[156:24.97]Yeah, you want me to turn around?
[156:26.07]Yeah, turn around.
[156:27.03]And open the door?
[156:27.71]Okay.
[156:28.57]What do you want me to do?
[156:29.27]You want me to get something?
[156:30.05]Yeah, I want you to leave.
[156:31.61]Oh, okay.
[156:32.05]You want me to leave, like, and then come back in?
[156:42.10]What the fuck, dude?
[156:43.16]What did I do?
[156:43.72]That guy's a fucking asshole.
[156:55.17]No, you're the asshole.
[156:56.91]No, you're the asshole.
[157:01.27]I agree with you on that one.
[157:03.17]That needs to be somewhere else.
[157:21.10]Where?
[157:22.10]How?
[157:22.20]Can somebody help me?
[157:23.26]Where do I put this?
[157:29.18]Mean here makes sense, but then you like can't get out of bed you get out of bed would suck But right in the middle, but then where does this go?
[157:40.92]Cuz I this is a collision I can't put this here Put the bed somewhere else.
[157:46.24]I know but what about my feng shui I?
[157:54.41]Somebody look it up.
[157:55.31]Somebody look it up.
[157:56.19]I'm pretty sure your feet are not supposed to be pointing towards the door.
[158:01.55]Somebody look that up.
[158:06.03]Is that true?
[158:10.50]Why?
[158:11.02]I don't know, but I know that's a thing.
[158:13.98]I always heard your feet are not supposed to be pointing towards the door.
[158:16.92]So I need to rethink every bedroom I've ever lived in because I've always been like that.
[158:21.06]Maybe that's why it feels like maybe I have nightmares for that reason.
[158:27.80]No, that's wrong.
[158:28.86]It should be feet pointing towards the door so you can see who's coming to kill you.
[158:36.55]Well, I guess that's accurate.
[158:38.27]But...
[158:46.29]What did, uh, I bring it up sometimes, but Bill Burr, what did Bill Burr say at the time?
[158:50.32]He was like, he didn't like, he hates motels because it's just a door and you just lie in there and like somebody can just open the door and you just lie in there just ready to be attacked.
[159:01.88]He just, he hates motels because of that.
[159:05.02]He's just like, he's like, no one's ready and no one's ready.
[159:11.29]And because the door just opens up right to where your bed is, it's just like, there you are.
[159:20.24]Just like, here I am.
[159:22.32]I'm outside, but now here is your bed.
[159:26.66]What is so necessary about the map?
[159:28.34]It's part of the quest.
[159:29.34]I have to put it in here.
[159:30.86]Or I get a lower grade.
[159:34.69]Whatever.
[159:35.23]You can fit.
[159:36.81]No one's going out here anyways.
[159:40.01]Guys, this is going to get used once, and then it's never going to get opened again.
[159:43.81]It's going to be locked permanently, and you're going to go out the front door.
[159:46.28]That's how these work.
[159:50.52]Any other little side entrances like this, like bedroom kind of step-out entrances, you do it for like two weeks, and then you never go out here ever again.
[160:00.21]You end up going like here.
[160:01.15]It's like, oh, okay, cool.
[160:02.43]What are we doing today?
[160:04.23]Alright, I got three stars.
[160:08.31]Nice.
[160:08.56]I got $26,000 for this one.
[160:19.96]That was a good one.
[160:29.97]My God.
[160:33.43]Hey.
[160:33.87]It was awesome.
[160:38.45]Harder than I expected.
[160:39.83]The house was unusual.
[160:43.46]It was awesome.
[160:43.88]Driftwood house?
[160:44.24]Okay.
[161:04.01]There's a site where you can look for rundown houses.
[161:06.65]Yeah, here we go.
[161:07.05]Just buy them, do your magic, and put them on sale.
[161:10.53]I'm sure that with your work quality, you'll find buyers in no time.
[161:14.47]You did so well with the last house that I managed to sell it for way more than I expected.
[161:20.08]So, I want to share some of the profit with you.
[161:22.92]Really?
[161:23.16]That should be enough for you to buy your own house to flip.
[161:25.68]If you want to, of course.
[161:27.06]Take care and good luck with your career. $80,000.
[161:39.75]Nice.
[161:40.41]Okay.
[161:43.84]Let's see what this looks like.
[162:08.97]Looks pretty smooth.
[162:15.22]His computer is going to explode.
[162:17.48]I got a 3090.
[162:17.74]This game has a lot of assets.
[162:27.42]I mean, again, you saw the Invitational.
[162:30.72]There's a lot of stuff that can be on the screen at once if you so choose.
[162:37.26]What is this?
[162:39.34]No matter what happens, remember that I love you.
[162:40.86]Okay.
[162:46.10]Alright, let's go.
[162:46.82]There's assembly missions.
[162:48.62]There are some houses now.
[162:51.92]Alright.
[162:54.10]Yeah, the game is here.
[162:56.08]Here it is.
[162:56.64]I like the drip feed, though.
[163:00.28]I feel like there's going to be a lot of content.
[163:05.21]Cool.
[163:08.07]Well, let me do some assembly.
[163:12.42]Table lamp.
[163:19.14]Begin assembly.
[163:20.08]Okay, so let's do assembly.
[163:21.38]Okay.
[163:30.03]The timer doesn't start until I open.
[163:31.29]Okay, finish assembly.
[163:32.25]Only good or perfect.
[163:33.07]Finish below one minute and ten seconds.
[163:35.23]Okay, here we go.
[163:36.83]Go.
[163:40.31]Oh.
[163:42.37]here we go what do I do?
[164:01.97]oh my goodness okay um
[164:45.52]I got it.
[164:46.42]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[164:47.70]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[164:52.15]Come on, put him in there.
[164:54.19]Oh, I failed it.
[164:59.93]Well, I lost like 20 seconds.
[165:01.41]I didn't know where everything was.
[165:10.13]Shit, I need to restart.
[165:20.22]restart oh god what's wrong hello there how did you like your first full
[165:30.24]Oh, okay.
[165:30.54]I exited to the menu.
[165:31.34]I forgot to hang up on him.
[165:33.70]Really?
[165:34.12]Really?
[165:59.15]I didn't just hang up on him.
[165:59.91]I threw the phone out the window.
[166:01.19]Alright, here we go.
[166:02.47]Ready?
[166:02.69]Good.
[166:27.02]Good.
[166:29.66]Come on, dude.
[166:30.20]Go.
[166:32.46]Oh, I had it.
[166:33.56]Where's it?
[166:47.90]Go.
[166:59.00]I did it.
[167:01.68]Three stars.
[167:07.56]Beautiful.
[167:12.66]There's another one too.
[167:13.27]What's the other one?
[167:23.10]What?
[167:23.28]I got a computer chip in my brain
[167:45.02]He's outside the window.
[167:45.64]His face is just right here.
[167:46.30]Alright, is he gonna... Does he call me again?
[167:48.21]I don't know if I can do this one.
[168:15.67]Okay.
[168:16.91]50 seconds.
[168:18.87]Go.
[168:26.94]What?
[168:28.04]What's going on?
[168:28.58]Oh.
[168:45.50]I'll admit, the first two were real.
[168:47.78]The second two were not.
[168:58.19]What is going on?
[168:58.95]Oh, I have to make it the right time.
[169:00.57]Oh, fuck.
[169:03.17]Ah!
[169:03.25]Do it again.
[169:10.47]This dude is on substances.
[169:11.98]I'm fine.
[169:15.67]He keeps giving me money.
[169:20.44]He keeps giving me money.
[169:24.44]This guy keeps waking up with like amnesia.
[169:26.36]Oh, I'm okay with that.
[169:26.96]I'll take the extra 40 grand.
[169:44.96]You'll find buyers in no time.
[169:46.90]You did so well with the last house that I managed to sell it for way more than I expected.
[169:51.74]He's going to give me more money.
[169:53.06]I want to share some of the profit with you.
[169:55.17]Okay.
[169:55.51]It should be enough for you to buy.
[169:56.89]I'm going to get another $25.
[169:57.71]I'm going to get another $25.
[170:00.29]Good luck with your career.
[170:07.00]Oh, okay.
[170:08.16]Well, I want...
[170:42.42]No, just go backwards!
[170:47.63]Alright, let's get another phone call.
[171:08.09]That's so funny.
[171:08.87]Oh, look at the money I got now.
[171:26.09]I'm sure that with your work quality, you'll find buyers in no time.
[171:30.02]You did so well with the last house that I managed to sell it for way more than I expected.
[171:35.64]So, I want to share some of the profit with you.
[171:38.64]It should be enough for you to buy your own house, Flip.
[171:41.20]If you want to, of course.
[171:42.56]Take care and good luck with your career.
[171:44.64]I'm seeing a lot of ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-has.
[171:48.42]I'm seeing a lot of ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
[171:57.66]Starting to wonder how much he sold that last house for.
[172:00.92]Yeah.
[172:04.34]Okay.
[172:05.39]I'll buy this one.
[172:05.89]I got 120 grand.
[172:07.69]I mean, I didn't get it.
[172:09.85]I didn't get it legally.
[172:12.55]But I didn't cheat.
[172:13.27]This one's a big one.
[172:21.92]I might actually save this one.
[172:23.10]Because I want to get the destruction tool.
[172:27.32]Just like a little one?
[172:31.89]I'm going to just do a little one.
[172:33.29]Just a little house.
[172:34.23]42,000.
[172:34.37]I'm buying it.
[172:45.10]Yeah.
[172:46.40]I'm going here.
[172:54.04]Flipping houses for profit isn't easy.
[172:55.46]You'll need to clean, renovate, and furnish the house.
[172:57.66]All without a quest list.
[173:01.62]Ready to sell?
[173:02.56]You'll find potential buyers in the auction house tab.
[173:06.92]Ooh.
[173:07.68]So, I think they've taken the training wheels off.
[173:10.64]I think that's what they mean.
[173:12.66]That's cool.
[173:16.37]It's dirty.
[173:20.27]Very dirty.
[173:20.83]Oops-a-daisy.
[173:24.26]Move my seat a little.
[173:28.86]Are you gonna make a saw house?
[173:30.58]Uh, the, the... Anything that could be a saw house is gonna have to be when I unlock the sludge hammer.
[173:40.55]Which the saw, the... I'm not gonna make a saw house, but you know what I mean.
[173:44.43]The saw type houses are gonna have to happen tomorrow.
[173:51.84]Because I think we have to unlock it first.
[173:53.46]I don't have it.
[173:54.30]Should I just do... You know what?
[173:55.60]I have an idea.
[173:57.42]I'm going to do jobs until I get to the sledgehammer.
[174:02.50]That makes more sense to me because then I have more freedom.
[174:06.13]So let's do that.
[174:07.41]Let me get the hammer.
[174:10.23]I own this house now.
[174:11.01]I'm going to save it.
[174:14.79]So yeah, let me get all the tools.
[174:16.09]That makes more sense.
[174:21.84]Oh, I don't want to sell it right now.
[174:23.00]No, what?
[174:28.10]Alright, I'm going to go home.
[174:38.02]Because then we get way more freedom by taking down walls, putting up walls.
[174:41.97]Yeah, I think it's probably better just to do the missions to get to my grandson.
[174:48.51]DIY went very wrong.
[174:51.89]Well, my daughter is a self-proclaimed DIY queen.
[174:53.79]I have to admit, the decoration stuff she makes is really adorable.
[174:57.79]But she should probably stay away from any kind of total interior renovations.
[175:01.50]Our poor bathroom is her latest unfortunate victim.
[175:05.54]Can you clean up the mess?
[175:06.68]And some proper renovation wouldn't hurt.
[175:09.50]Okay, I think we've got to get it here.
[175:11.74]Also, there's the kitchen.
[175:12.56]There's little to no counter space.
[175:14.45]And while I loved its clean white aesthetic once, now I found it a bit dull.
[175:18.85]Maybe it's time for some color.
[175:20.45]Alright.
[175:24.13]Sure.
[175:29.00]We have a new detective job to do, so let's do it.
[175:31.93]What's this other one?
[175:40.12]Alright, let's do this one because I think this is probably gonna unlock a tool.
[176:14.44]And... Are we gonna get a new tool?
[176:17.23]This place is huge.
[176:49.85]Why did you hide the picture of our like entire family?
[176:56.00]Alright, let's do some detective work.
[176:57.30]So.
[176:59.14]I see.
[177:01.50]Slipped.
[177:03.81]Walked.
[177:04.21]This is coming down the stairs.
[177:05.67]So what happened?
[177:24.68]What's going on in here?
[177:29.02]Smurf crime scene.
[177:30.70]Oh no, what happened?
[177:43.51]Oh no.
[177:47.01]Dude, holy shit, I just realized something.
[177:51.14]Holy shit.
[177:52.98]Yeah.
[177:53.68]Wait, did we bring this up?
[177:54.50]I don't remember.
[177:55.02]It's been a while.
[177:56.26]Smurfs are Andes and mafia people.
[178:00.56]Right?
[178:00.92]Did we talk about this?
[178:02.18]I forget.
[178:04.00]Isn't it like book Smurf?
[178:07.76]Uh, like Sneezy Smurf.
[178:10.69]Papa Smurf.
[178:11.93]Construction Smurf.
[178:19.06]Like, scientist Smurf.
[178:23.62]They have, like, they name themselves like Andes.
[178:38.43]Does that mean that the Smurfs are the Mafia?
[178:40.01]Ooh, the spray works.
[178:51.00]Bray works wicked good.
[178:57.11]Alright.
[179:03.03]Before getting overwhelmed, let's go down here.
[179:08.15]Let's start out here.
[179:16.66]Anything on the outside?
[179:17.96]No.
[179:19.18]Nothing on the outside.
[179:19.92]It's only the inside.
[179:22.74]Rewatch what you just said it makes no sense.
[179:25.16]Well, will you hear an hour and a half ago?
[179:31.82]You need the context from like two hours ago Don't blame me because you you jumped in on like you're in the middle of like episode six Everybody here was at episode one
[180:03.78]Whoa, wait a minute.
[180:07.88]Really?
[180:10.78]They want me to get rid of this.
[180:12.36]This is actually really nice though, isn't it?
[180:18.10]This took a lot of time and is kind of beautiful.
[180:25.02]I mean, if you take away a lot of the slop and you clean it up a little, I think this looks really nice.
[180:41.67]Okay.
[180:44.89]I think it looks fine.
[180:45.73]I mean, need some painter's tape and some... Okay, some of these are a little scuffed.
[181:02.69]I don't know if the paint fumes were doing something in here, but...
[181:10.23]Yeah, it's charming though.
[181:11.86]I would have left it.
[181:12.40]Maybe I should spray it all first.
[181:31.13]This is not art.
[181:31.99]This is slop.
[181:34.59]I think you're just a hater.
[181:56.90]Sloppenheimer?
[182:01.93]That sounds like a great Elden Ring DLC character name when I play the game again.
[182:18.88]Sloppenheimer.
[182:27.01]What's going on with these?
[182:27.67]These tiles or what are they?
[182:28.71]Alright, still.
[182:37.39]Okay, there's still.
[182:38.09]Yeah, obviously the puke in the sink.
[182:51.78]Alright, clean the window.
[183:00.01]Cool.
[183:07.75]What needs to be sold in here?
[183:08.75]Probably everything, right?
[183:10.89]Spoil it.
[183:11.31]Yeah, pretty much everything.
[183:15.51]So I'm not going to 100% this one.
[183:17.75]Because I want the tools.
[183:23.60]I can always come back and do it.
[183:24.68]You can replay the missions.
[183:29.42]I can always replay it.
[183:32.46]Plus, I can play... I'm going to be playing this game, so... Even if it's not on stream, I will be just chilling out, probably just playing it, so... I can come back and do it again.
[183:42.07]Alright, what else do we need?
[183:44.85]You're a slacker?
[183:47.99]Huh?
[183:52.14]You sold the toilet?
[183:52.80]You didn't buy a new one?
[183:53.88]Well, my philosophy... Which, by the way, is very high.
[183:58.91]At least an 85.
[184:00.65]Is clean the entire house first.
[184:02.91]Remove all the things that need to be removed.
[184:05.70]And then... Do what you need to do.
[184:09.02]So the bathroom's clean.
[184:10.54]That was the biggest job.
[184:15.40]This room doesn't need anything.
[184:18.39]This one is good.
[184:19.01]I think it is.
[184:22.21]It is, yep.
[184:23.65]So I'm gonna... Close this...
[184:30.37]Everything's good in here.
[184:31.01]That paint can was the only thing that I needed to get rid of.
[184:37.46]Okay.
[184:39.38]This room is also fine.
[184:47.51]That's the bathroom.
[184:48.67]This room is the one I just was in.
[184:50.07]This one is also fine.
[184:52.41]I just remember that from Squeaks.
[185:00.54]That has a scary connotation to it now because of the Squeaks house.
[185:06.11]Well, Squeaks in Northern Line, right?
[185:11.62]So I'm good upstairs.
[185:13.56]Let's... What is... Sell what?
[185:15.28]A sponge?
[185:19.73]Oh, you want me to sell the whole thing.
[185:20.75]Okay.
[185:31.18]Anything else to sell?
[185:31.94]That looks like it.
[185:35.02]Let's start picking up the trash.
[185:45.25]Not a whole lot of trash.
[186:02.37]Clean.
[186:38.05]A little bit more.
[186:38.55]I think that's it for here.
[186:46.08]It is.
[186:46.68]Okay.
[186:50.62]You want new stuff.
[186:52.86]Ceramic tiles.
[186:54.93]Brickbond subway tiles.
[186:56.27]Look at these.
[187:07.76]Oh, fuck.
[187:08.30]My favorite part about this is it looks like he's casting a spell.
[187:23.01]Haha, you messed up.
[187:32.24]You messed up.
[187:33.08]Look, you messed up.
[187:34.04]Look!
[187:35.02]Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[187:38.60]I'll fix it watch I Give you extra for free And it lines up to the lip for free oh They wanted more okay over here
[188:08.19]I actually kind of like that.
[188:08.85]Nice looking.
[188:15.41]Oven.
[188:15.59]So this is the kitchen.
[188:25.84]Sink to me goes... Yeah, I like this.
[188:32.45]It's fine.
[188:39.34]I like these thin fridges.
[188:44.82]Why is it called an oven if you take the cold food in and take the hot food out?
[188:52.23]They say it should be of out.
[188:58.15]An of out?
[189:01.65]I guess I'm picking up what you're putting down.
[189:06.91]Oh no, another cabinet puzzle.
[189:09.14]What the hell am I going to do?
[189:14.44]That's cute.
[189:15.92]A little egg.
[189:17.14]That's very cute.
[189:25.59]You got a hard out?
[189:28.63]Yeah, I got a hard out.
[189:31.19]Probably like in the next 30-40 minutes.
[189:34.71]Maybe like half hour?
[189:38.70]What I'll make sure I'll do is I'm going to unlock the tools tonight.
[189:42.97]So then tomorrow we can really just go ham and make a bunch of crazy stuff.
[189:51.73]I'm trying to pace myself with these trains because I've been live like obviously three, four, five days in a row.
[189:58.14]And what, two days ago was like eight hours.
[190:00.62]I'm just trying not to like puke.
[190:21.84]Wait a minute, isn't this?
[190:22.74]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[190:28.04]Is this what the recreation was trying to be this?
[190:36.19]I recognize this one of these patterns.
[190:38.11]Which one is it like this one?
[190:44.73]So the tile existed is that's OK, this one.
[190:50.92]I'm going to say something for my dad.
[190:51.88]It's his birthday.
[190:54.50]Well, Mr. Milky Gorilla, happy birthday.
[191:02.84]From me.
[191:04.59]Jerma985.
[191:09.69]And I don't know if you knew what your son or daughter's username was, but you do now.
[191:16.55]And I hope I just didn't cause a family problem.
[191:19.82]I don't know.
[191:36.49]It's family meeting.
[191:41.41]Well, what do you want?
[191:41.97]I don't, I don't know.
[191:42.95]I don't know anybody's names.
[191:46.27]I know you by, when I look over here and I see your username, I don't know.
[191:49.49]Oh, of course your name is like Craig.
[191:53.75]I don't know that.
[191:56.09]I'm going to call you Milky Gorilla because that's what your name is on my screen.
[191:59.77]Is this what else do I need?
[192:07.40]Oh, we got to furnish this.
[192:10.90]You got it.
[192:18.45]That just peeled out of the driveway.
[192:23.69]I love that so much.
[192:26.37]That is such a good... I love it.
[192:33.35]Come on.
[192:33.85]I can't fit the rubber ducky anywhere on the corner.
[192:38.13]Well, it can stay in the bathroom then.
[192:39.65]That's fine.
[192:39.95]Alright.
[192:42.71]So... I still need... There's a lot of items that need to go in here.
[192:49.21]Sink and cabinet.
[192:49.93]Let's try this.
[192:54.93]He's ruining families.
[192:59.39]Why is Milky Gorilla the first thing that comes up in your head?
[193:01.57]OK, I'm going to make a reference to about like 40 minutes ago.
[193:10.18]We talked about somebody that came in like during episode six.
[193:13.71]you and was like, we were already at episode.
[193:16.43]Well, episode one was like four hours ago.
[193:18.91]So you came in during episode six and you've caught up all you've maybe have you caught up all the way through 15 seconds of episode six have started.
[193:28.34]You're already asking questions.
[193:34.01]You can't lean over in episode six and say, who's that?
[193:36.17]Like, come on, man.
[193:53.56]cabinet.
[194:06.09]I kind of like this mirror.
[194:10.25]What's your favorite tool?
[194:12.03]The hammer.
[194:56.35]Ah, the trash bin!
[195:24.76]Man, my house level, what?
[195:33.05]Oh, okay.
[195:33.51]You start throwing garbage all over the rig.
[195:45.80]I kind of like it here.
[195:47.06]Put some nice things on display.
[195:50.24]Oh, this is more functional here.
[195:52.23]Yeah, here.
[195:58.60]I need the toilet flusher.
[196:01.21]Doesn't come with it, so you have to, like, install it.
[196:04.23]So you pull down, you do... Cool.
[196:14.02]Looks good.
[196:18.78]I don't really love this being here, but the door opens and we're good.
[196:31.82]I could probably finish it if I wanted to.
[196:34.00]Is that everything that's in here?
[196:36.38]Yeah, this whole room is done.
[196:37.41]Okay, cool.
[196:39.37]Excellent.
[196:41.87]Now what?
[196:43.31]If I'm close to three, might as well just get it.
[196:46.05]Downstairs?
[196:47.19]Yeah.
[196:47.33]Alright, there's a sponge somewhere that I have to sell.
[196:55.71]Oh my god.
[196:56.39]I just had this flashback to when Kryken told me to press F to turn the flashlight on and I didn't.
[197:12.34]Their house was so fucking funny.
[197:17.04]That was a great way to end it.
[197:18.38]It really was.
[197:19.82]That was phenomenal.
[197:22.72]I think that could have probably been like the perfect ending to that stream.
[197:26.87]You know what I mean?
[197:29.23]And they stuck around like, Criken and Natalix, they stuck around for like eight hours.
[197:33.43]They just, they spent the whole day, all day there.
[197:36.40]And they still killed it at the end, so.
[197:40.96]Yeah, that's huge props to Etalyx and Criken, seriously.
[197:45.46]Stuck it out.
[197:46.56]And it was unbelievable.
[197:50.30]You just love storytelling.
[197:51.75]Yeah, it's fun.
[197:53.25]I like stories.
[197:58.59]Oh, this is why.
[197:59.71]Because I have the whole kitchen to do.
[198:01.21]Alright, well this is another kitchen puzzle.
[198:03.41]So I'm just going to do it however I want to get the money.
[198:36.39]I'm almost at three.
[198:37.17]I'm almost at three.
[198:41.87]On top of a regular cabinet.
[198:49.07]I guess that does kind of work.
[198:50.57]It's fine.
[199:05.10]Make a bar.
[199:12.14]I'm almost at three stars.
[199:13.88]Okay, I think I just have to put them down.
[199:16.78]And I'll get it.
[199:21.56]We're good.
[199:23.25]There's no eating.
[199:23.99]I just want the money.
[199:33.03]Where is this sponge?
[199:35.08]Oh, there we go.
[199:37.71]You're putting it in front of the radiator?
[199:39.17]Oh yeah, that's dangerous.
[199:41.71]That's dangerous.
[199:51.38]Wait, there's a... Hold on.
[199:52.28]There's a lot of just bullshit over here.
[200:01.80]Something else can fit in there.
[200:14.98]Shit.
[200:15.92]Damn it.
[200:27.19]He's so bad at this.
[200:28.71]I'm just trying to go quick.
[200:30.06]Because I want the three stars, I want the money, and then I want the sledgehammer.
[200:52.35]Hey, the jobs, the actual jobs from the emails don't show before and after.
[200:57.17]So I, hey, look, I'm just, I'm taking the money and I'm running.
[201:05.26]Oh, for a second, I thought I was doing before and after.
[201:06.98]I was like, oh no.
[201:14.44]I made a lot of money from that one.
[201:15.46]Okay, let me, I want to do something.
[201:18.82]Hold on.
[201:23.13]You're gonna get fired.
[201:25.72]Any more assembly missions?
[201:26.58]I like those.
[201:27.10]Yeah, these are my favorite.
[201:29.76]I gotta get three on all these.
[201:31.92]Alright, let's do shelf.
[201:39.52]We didn't get a phone call though, so that's good.
[201:47.02]Alright.
[201:48.62]Two minutes and 35 seconds.
[201:50.70]This is gonna be a long one.
[201:55.70]What?
[201:58.36]Oh God, OK.
[202:00.44]I did something wrong.
[202:22.84]What am I doing wrong?
[202:30.98]Is this even the right one?
[202:31.90]I was trying to, I was holding the button down.
[202:47.17]Wait, I think I had to drill the hole first.
[202:53.09]No, what are these little, these little like nubs?
[202:55.39]What are those?
[203:11.09]Okay, that was weird.
[203:15.73]Was I not hovering over it correctly?
[203:17.53]Wait, wait, it's not even on there.
[203:25.84]How do I put the screws on it?
[203:32.64]Oh shit, there we go.
[203:38.05]Is this in the right spot?
[203:40.91]What's happening?
[203:59.19]TikTok, Trevor, TikTok.
[204:04.19]Because there's two of these, there's four of these.
[204:10.33]I have them selected, right?
[204:11.31]Four of these.
[204:14.17]It's okay.
[204:26.14]How do I do it?
[204:28.61]Drill one hole and wait for it to complete.
[204:41.64]I just spent three minutes trying to figure out how to drill a hole.
[204:44.16]Uh, I don't think I'm gonna get the grand prize for this one.
[204:50.51]Did I just have to do that a few times?
[204:55.69]Well, let me get it right.
[204:56.41]Then... Cool.
[205:16.45]This is just practice.
[205:18.53]I'll get the three stars.
[205:19.21]Alright, so this is drilling the hole.
[205:29.04]Hmm.
[205:29.98]Okay.
[205:32.76]I did that a few times last time.
[205:34.38]Was I doing it wrong somehow?
[205:35.48]Uh-oh.
[205:51.03]I'm testing to see how hard you can swing it and how light you can swing it.
[205:53.82]Curious.
[205:55.53]This is just a trial run.
[206:22.49]Stick this on there.
[206:25.41]This is going to be hard to do this in like two minutes.
[206:29.63]These actually will be fairly difficult.
[206:33.57]I can't imagine building a whole bookcase or something later.
[206:37.70]It's going to drive me crazy.
[206:51.47]And I gotta put this stuff on there too?
[207:01.60]This last little touch is the way they get you.
[207:07.91]Well... It was okay.
[207:11.27]I'll try again.
[207:24.55]Under three minutes, right?
[207:26.21]Alright, now I understand what's going on.
[207:28.41]I'll get this lightning quick.
[207:29.97]Just watch me.
[207:31.25]Just watch me.
[207:32.79]Ready?
[207:34.11]See, how you really do is you want to make sure that no one's really... There you go.
[208:57.90]I got it for sure.
[209:07.80]Yeah, I definitely have it for sure.
[209:09.14]Just gotta watch those.
[209:14.06]Succulents.
[209:26.82]Perfect.
[209:47.49]What's the other one table?
[209:53.17]OK.
[209:54.71]What's the timer on this one?
[209:55.70]I just didn't see it.
[209:56.58]3 minutes.
[209:59.12]Alright, this is the trial run and just want to learn.
[210:01.14]Oh boy.
[210:01.70]Gotta sit up for this one.
[210:10.63]Oops.
[210:14.83]What is the crime?
[210:15.81]Eating a meal?
[210:19.01]Succulent Chinese meal?
[210:22.50]What is the charge?
[210:24.32]Alright, I'm setting up.
[210:28.82]I might, maybe I, maybe I can just get it.
[210:34.68]No, we'll do, we gotta, you gotta do one trial run, right?
[210:36.96]Okay, so here we take a board.
[210:40.32]Place the boards here.
[210:41.50]I'm going to place them all first.
[210:54.97]Then we do all the screws.
[211:18.58]Where's my character?
[211:25.64]Oh shit, my indicator.
[211:30.34]Is I standing on top of it?
[211:40.41]I wonder if the save time is added time.
[211:51.45]There's no way he's sober.
[211:52.99]What are you talking about?
[211:54.39]Okay, I get it.
[212:13.53]I see what you mean now.
[212:14.97]Yeah, yeah, that's a problem.
[212:16.32]That's a problem.
[212:16.84]They're not even connected.
[212:27.69]Hold on.
[212:28.03]Yeah, it let me put it there.
[212:30.45]Do you know look it it snapped?
[212:34.67]Do you see if it's like snap?
[212:37.03]Yep, that's got goes there.
[212:38.61]It told me it went there When I was placing it it was like wait It was correct.
[212:44.55]You guys are just bullshit Now I gotta do all this in five minutes less than that oh
[213:04.92]Oh, these are little ones.
[213:05.70]This dude is definitely not sober.
[213:14.98]Is there an easier way to... Okay, I can do mouse scroll, but I feel like that's going to be trickier than just clicking.
[213:20.44]But maybe not if I get used to it.
[213:37.70]Even after the meltdown there, I still have plenty of time.
[213:40.79]I could definitely do it.
[213:53.28]I actually do think clicking is better for me.
[214:12.65]I think this is it after this one.
[214:28.06]Yeah, OK.
[214:28.40]What does it want me to do?
[214:36.34]Oh.
[214:39.55]Alright, yeah, I spent a minute at least freaking out that I thought I messed the whole thing up so I can do it.
[214:59.86]I wonder how many assembly jobs there are.
[215:01.34]These are these are some of my favorite part of the game.
[215:03.24]I love this.
[215:04.05]It's just fun.
[215:05.39]I'm putting like a little project together.
[215:09.07]Okay.
[215:10.01]Three minutes and five seconds.
[215:14.73]And... Go.
[215:18.45]Wait.

[215:36.49]Come on.
[215:37.15]Go.
[215:50.54]I tried to say shit and stupid at the same time.

[216:09.87]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[216:11.61]Put it down, put it down.

[216:54.49]Go this way!
[217:07.00]Put it in there!
[217:13.98]Getting the camera there is tricky.

[217:49.37]30 seconds.
[218:06.18]Yeah, I got it.
[218:15.46]You were more calm while fighting the Regenerators in Resident Evil 4.
[218:21.28]So what you're saying is House Flipper 2 is a much higher skill, higher intensity game than Resident Evil 4?
[218:33.65]Interesting.
[218:34.23]I didn't say it, you did.

[220:08.34]Just to get some unlockables.
[220:11.60]Because then tomorrow, we've got a lot of work to do on our house tomorrow.
[220:18.18]I'm going to probably tell you the entirety of tomorrow's stream, like the entire three and a half to four and a half hours, maybe longer, depends, will just be on that house.
[220:27.73]I'm going to spend like five hours on it.

[220:55.23]tell you a bit about my grandson Johnny.
[220:58.61]After all, your job is to prepare a room for him and I really wanted to make him feel at home right away.
[221:06.72]I even bought some of his favorite books so he can have them here.
[221:16.23]Oh, yes.
[221:17.61]He always has his nose in a book.
[221:20.57]Ever since he was a little boy, he would look at me and say, Grandma, I got a new book.
[221:27.80]Read it with me.
[221:29.08]Very well spoken.
[221:31.08]Even as a toddler.
[221:32.80]Now he reads by himself, of course.
[221:35.96]Doesn't need grandma's help at all.
[221:38.69]What the fuck?
[221:39.55]Yeah.
[221:42.97]I think so.
[221:43.55]Yeah.
[221:43.85]Yeah.
[221:44.24]Yeah.
[222:21.33]Yeah.
[222:39.60]I'm not- I'm just getting it out of the box.
[222:43.58]Okay.
[222:46.02]So.
[222:48.13]Now sell them.
[222:51.76]That's a, that's a roller coaster kit.
[222:54.28]That's a roller coaster kit.
[222:55.66]Bring this over here.
[223:07.12]Cool.
[223:34.05]Can I pick up the whole thing?
[223:34.79]Uh-oh.
[223:38.86]I'm gonna leave this here for now.
[224:01.64]Speedrun my ass.
[224:06.25]Well, I saw the train station and I got excited.
[224:09.95]What do you mean, huh?
[224:24.69]What do you mean, huh?
[224:27.60]That's a... Guys, that's a phrase.
[224:31.10]That... Hey.
[224:32.70]That means... Come on.
[224:34.34]You know what that means.
[224:39.07]That means you're full of shit.
[224:40.43]Like, oh yeah, you're going to do it.
[224:41.98]My ass, you're going to speed run it.
[224:44.74]That means bullshit.
[224:45.54]That means you're full of shit.
[224:56.61]Did you mean it that way?
[224:59.01]Yeah.
[225:02.89]No, you see, I meant it a different way.
[225:07.58]What are you talking about?
[225:13.97]That is not what that means.
[225:15.19]What are you talking about?
[225:23.86]What are you talking about?
[225:25.14]Okay.
[225:26.20]Still cleaning to do.
[225:29.96]Ooh.
[225:30.90]Yucky.
[225:41.09]A different way to say that would have been, speed running, you're full of it.
[225:47.28]Speed running the room, you're full of it.
[226:11.95]If we were in the 50s, maybe.
[226:14.83]Some of those... What are you talking about?
[226:18.17]I feel like I use that phrase a lot.
[226:35.21]That's a good phrase.
[226:38.16]Chat is full of zoomers.
[226:39.32]Ignore them.
[226:56.24]Yeah, those phrases exist with zoomers, don't they?
[226:58.70]I feel like some of you do.
[227:02.56]Okay.
[227:06.22]The place is clean.
[227:08.22]Not 100%.
[227:09.86]What am I missing?
[227:12.03]Ceiling?
[227:16.61]Oh, this window.
[227:21.57]Yeah, there are grown adults in here.
[227:25.50]You know what's really interesting?
[227:27.86]Because everything is so anonymous and I have no idea who any of you are, there could be like a 40-year-old man and like a 20-year-old in here at the same time.
[227:38.85]And the 40-year-old man and the 20-year-old could, you know, you're connecting on this.
[227:44.77]You know, you both said Omega Lull at the same time.
[227:50.21]See?
[227:50.83]The generations aren't so different.
[227:53.49]You both said Omega LOL together.
[227:54.69]Look!
[227:55.35]Look!
[227:55.57]1, 2, 3, look at all these!
[227:58.04]40, 50, 50, 50-year-old, 40-year-old, 40, 40, 40, 50, 50, 50, 50, 20, 20, 60, 60, 60, 40, 40, 40, see?
[228:00.14]You guys, you guys are gonna get along?
[228:01.32]What are you talking about?
[228:02.28]Still at 2, oh, there.
[228:26.17]Still some stuff to sell.
[228:27.31]Yeah.
[228:31.62]OK, I am ready to paint.
[228:37.42]Wait, was it?
[228:40.51]Ah.
[228:43.71]This is the I like this color scheme.
[229:18.44]Should I do the whole, wait, should I do the whole thing, this, or should I change it up?
[229:28.75]I think that this is, is this correct?
[229:31.90]Change it up?
[230:25.46]Uh, I don't know.
[230:28.60]I'm not tall enough to get up there.
[230:42.96]There we go.
[231:00.61]Good.
[231:06.71]Yeah, this is not going to do.
[231:09.42]I could do stripes or something.
[231:11.22]Should I do stripes?
[231:24.87]Polka dots?
[231:25.95]I could do polka dots, but I don't know.
[231:37.40]I'm going to keep it simple.
[231:40.67]We're going to do blue on all the walls and then yellow up top.
[231:44.29]I don't know.
[231:57.00]Do a trim at the bottom.
[231:59.40]That's not a bad idea.
[232:13.41]Do only one bright, funky color.
[232:37.58]It's hard to take you seriously.
[232:40.84]Guys, I do a thing where I pretend to burp puke in my mouth and swallow it.
[232:46.10]Why are you taking me seriously?
[232:47.34]That's a regular joke that I do.
[233:19.59]Is that a serious question?
[233:20.65]No.
[233:21.93]It isn't.
[233:23.48]It isn't.
[233:23.76]I'm just chilling.
[233:28.42]Hey, you good?
[233:31.13]Mario Galaxy versus Mario Sunshine.
[233:37.11]They're both good.
[233:38.13]I would say probably Galaxy.
[233:50.05]Although Galaxy makes me kind of motion sick.
[233:52.43]Not going to reach.
[234:07.93]Yeah.
[234:11.07]I have some movie recommendations.
[234:14.43]Roger Rabbit.
[234:15.41]Oh, that's the other required reading one, right?
[234:17.65]How could I forget that?
[234:19.05]I remember I was thinking, I was like, what's the other one?
[234:20.71]It's Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
[234:22.01]What's your favorite milk substitute?
[234:37.50]I like oat milk.
[234:40.89]Oat milk is good.
[234:46.33]I used to drink almond milk, but oat milk is a little thicker.
[234:50.64]And I think it tastes a little bit better.
[234:52.84]If you like nuts, if you like that kind of almond flavor, then almond milk is obviously better, but... I like the oats.
[235:06.39]Oat.
[235:20.91]That was really satisfying for some reason.
[235:34.00]Oh, that's cool.
[235:37.08]Done.
[235:44.42]I had a dream that you were a laughing head and you popped it.
[235:47.43]Stop eating before you go to bed.
[235:50.41]And stop sleeping with this stream on.
[235:57.68]I keep having these dreams and nightmares about you, and then I wake up and both of my headphones are in.
[236:03.04]And your stream is on.
[236:10.85]You have to go offline.
[236:12.07]I will.
[236:12.67]Alright, so this is good.
[236:16.77]Now we gotta do some decorating.
[236:19.07]Hmm.
[236:34.80]Alright, single bed.
[236:35.93]This way.
[236:51.34]That makes sense to me.
[236:54.32]Radiator.
[236:57.50]I want this inside so it's not at the window.
[237:00.10]Otherwise, maybe you lose a little heat here.
[237:03.01]I'm going to stay probably like, I don't know, right here?
[237:05.51]Not a bad place for it.
[237:07.50]Right here?
[237:08.08]No.
[237:08.76]Like right here.
[237:10.30]Yeah, right here.
[237:17.30]Isn't it weird to have stairs in your bedroom?
[237:21.61]Um, I think it just depends.
[237:23.25]I mean, this is an attic living space, so in that scenario, no.
[237:27.37]No.
[237:47.52]That's not bad.
[237:48.06]Blue seat.
[237:54.10]Corner.
[237:56.13]I'll put that in the corner, but I gotta move all the stuff right now.
[238:06.53]Aren't you supposed to put it under the window?
[238:10.66]Yeah, maybe.
[238:11.26]We'll find out.
[238:12.26]Wait, I can throw this?
[238:15.74]Can I actually shoot a basket?
[238:16.64]That's cool.
[238:42.01]Here we go.
[238:55.34]Bookcase.
[238:55.94]Poster.
[238:57.60]A crayfish.
[238:59.06]Oh, that's cute.
[238:59.58]Where should this go?
[239:03.64]Right there.
[239:09.54]Yeah.
[239:11.86]Nightstand.
[239:12.74]Good spot for it.
[239:20.37]Table lamp.
[239:23.67]Blink.
[239:25.27]Carpet.
[239:30.92]Down there.
[239:33.82]Desk.
[239:35.46]Yep.
[239:38.89]Office chair.
[239:43.18]Cool.
[239:45.04]Bookcase.
[239:49.74]Hmm.
[239:49.86]Oh shit, what happened?
[239:55.27]Where are my audio?
[239:58.39]What the hell?
[239:58.73]I just lost audio.
[240:00.27]That's weird.
[240:03.50]Can you guys still hear me?
[240:04.52]It looks like it's still going through.
[240:08.14]My go XLR just like messed up.
[240:15.16]OK, that's weird.
[240:17.74]I can hear now I said to reset it.
[240:24.73]I'm thinking bookcase probably has to go here.
[240:43.95]That's a little better.
[240:44.45]Alright, here we go.
[240:50.17]Books.
[240:59.42]Sweet.
[241:08.32]How many more books?
[241:09.14]Five?
[241:10.68]For the desk by the window?
[241:15.28]Eh.
[241:17.82]I get your philosophy.
[241:18.72]But I don't know.
[241:21.09]I kind of like being secluded over there.
[241:22.67]Oh, wait.
[241:25.03]Nothing can... Whatever.
[241:32.31]Yes!
[241:32.69]I got it.
[241:32.99]First try.
[241:44.43]This is Hey Arnold's room.
[241:50.24]Yeah, what was up with Hey Arnold?
[241:55.34]He had, like, a sci-fi room, didn't he?
[241:58.22]He pressed a button and his room became cool?
[242:04.00]The mechanics and the engineering that went behind that room were unbelievable.
[242:18.91]Hey there, short man.
[242:21.13]It's me, Grandpa.
[242:22.05]Remember, everybody that's introduced has to say it's me and then say who they are.
[242:34.34]That's how it works.
[242:39.34]I need to make sure you know what character I'm trying to do, so I have to say it's me.
[242:44.72]Like fucking Super Mario.
[242:51.57]the cars together.
[242:54.35]Yeah.
[243:04.72]Yeah, I'm putting this out of the way.
[243:05.70]I don't want to home alone myself.
[243:09.70]What are these?
[243:10.32]Oh, they're little bookends.
[243:13.00]Okay.
[243:34.56]Yeah, I'm aware I have the bookends and the books are down here, but I already started this and I don't feel like moving it.
[243:54.88]It's so weird that we can recognize objects.
[243:58.11]Uh, be careful.
[243:59.41]Every time I start talking like that, people yell at me and people say, you're a weirdo.
[244:03.45]Be careful.
[244:07.19]I remember when I talked about like, isn't it ridiculous that we have memories?
[244:10.03]Like you can just, you can recall information like a hard drive.
[244:13.77]Like we have, we have snapshots in our brain that are, that are locked in there.
[244:18.57]Be careful.
[244:18.91]You might get called a weirdo.
[244:36.61]Okay.
[244:37.25]What else do you want?
[244:38.25]Table lamp.
[244:39.23]This is looking kind of nice.
[244:40.71]I like it.
[244:49.35]Yeah, I like it.
[244:51.63]Look.
[244:56.49]This room is done.
[245:00.37]Oh, shit.
[245:02.43]Harry!
[245:04.34]I home alone to myself.
[245:05.78]Too bad.
[245:13.04]Okay, I just, that was an optical illusion.
[245:16.14]Did anybody else, because I opened it from, I saw it from here.
[245:19.91]I don't know why, but did anybody else think that this was the door for this frame?
[245:25.17]When I opened that, it was like, why am I going to, I'm going into another dimension.
[245:30.94]Like, when I was standing over here, in the corner of my eye, because there's no frame, I was like, oh, where's the frame?
[245:36.70]I thought, for a split second, I was like, why is this not...
[245:42.03]Dude's faded.
[245:42.81]I'm not.
[245:45.65]I just think too fast and too hard on everything.
[245:56.66]I'm not feeling well.
[245:58.02]I don't feel well.
[245:59.70]I'm sick today.
[246:08.01]Don't bring it up.
[246:15.32]Can't believe I almost just tried to sell the rubber ducky.
[246:16.84]What am I talking about?
[246:17.46]What's wrong with me?
[246:24.26]Ooh, really?
[246:28.88]Cleaning spray covers a bigger area with a single use.
[246:33.15]What's the last one?
[246:37.15]Oh, you can... There's no cooldown anymore.
[246:42.73]Oh.
[246:51.66]Nice.
[246:52.78]Right, the windows in here.
[246:57.46]Yeah.
[247:14.05]What do you want to sell this?
[247:15.05]OK.
[247:22.21]Interesting.
[247:24.43]Radiator.
[247:27.43]I'm going to do that last because... I don't know which... Yeah, I was going to put it over there.
[247:33.02]This should definitely go here because it's a big box.
[247:38.22]I don't know.
[247:38.62]On top?
[247:47.31]This is cute.
[247:55.55]Really cool poster.
[247:56.41]Yeah, that's fine.
[248:05.87]Mirror.
[248:08.81]And radiator.
[248:10.21]I did it.
[248:12.31]Alright, let's take a look.
[248:14.53]So you come on up here.
[248:15.59]Here's the brand new, never before seen, grandson room.
[248:31.96]Nice.
[248:34.06]What about the floor?
[248:35.07]I think the floor stays the same.
[248:37.65]At least in this one.
[248:38.37]This mission.
[248:42.91]I could... Wait, let me move this.
[248:45.85]Okay, are you guys a put it kind of under the bed?
[248:48.65]Or you put it in the middle?
[248:50.70]Or you put it kind of under the chair?
[248:52.16]What do you guys think?
[248:53.26]Where should I put it?
[248:54.00]Or should it go over here?
[248:57.74]Where it was, I think, was fine.
[248:58.90]I think it's good there.
[249:02.99]Yeah, that's more comfortable.
[249:05.73]And then this room.
[249:07.37]Nice.
[249:11.10]Cool.
[249:11.82]How much money was that for?
[249:12.50]$10,000.
[249:14.20]Nice.
[249:21.58]Very cool.
[249:22.11]Alright, apparently... Is the sledgehammer mission next?
[249:24.99]Let's find out.
[249:33.53]It is not.
[249:37.11]Ready to do assembly missions?
[249:38.14]Nope.
[249:40.08]I think I'll call it here.
[249:42.64]I am having a good time.
[249:45.10]Very, very, very fun so far.
[249:48.74]I'll see you guys tomorrow morning.
[249:49.68]I'm going to go again.
[249:52.60]Tomorrow, so what I'm going to do, probably tonight I'll do a couple more missions.
[249:56.50]I'll try to get to the sledgehammer.
[249:59.00]If for some reason I don't get to the Sledgehammer, then I will do a like four plus hour sandbox build.
[250:07.28]Because I really didn't do one.
[250:08.90]You saw like the, I mean, I was obviously juggling a lot of people and like hosting and keeping track of time and keeping track of people.
[250:16.56]And that build from a couple of nights ago that I was like, I was just kind of messing around.
[250:22.86]So maybe we'll just do like a three or four plus hour build in sandbox.
[250:30.44]I think that's a good way to round it out.
[250:31.90]We'll make one of our wacky houses.
[250:39.10]10 a.m.
[250:39.36]tomorrow.
[250:40.10]Pacific time.
[250:41.34]Again, thanks House Flipper for sponsoring the stream.
[250:44.49]It's been great.
[250:46.83]Having a lot of fun with it so far.
[250:48.87]Make sure you go to houseflipper2.com slash contest.
[250:54.61]If you have the game, if you grab the game, they're doing a big community contest.
[250:59.73]Grand Prize is a really swanky custom PC with a ridiculous looking custom frame.
[251:08.63]Go check it out.
[251:16.88]And yeah, thanks for sponsoring the stream.
[251:18.20]And thanks for sponsoring tomorrow.
[251:20.44]It's been great.
[251:23.60]I don't know if I talked about this, but playing House Slipper 1 as long as I did and being into that game and caring about it and thinking it was fun.
[251:31.51]And then House Slipper 2 comes out and it's like so exciting and I got a sponsor to play it.
[251:36.81]That's just, I did not think this was ever going to happen.
[251:39.39]So this is really, really cool.
[251:42.91]Good, good, good shit.
[251:44.11]Thank you, House Slipper devs.
[251:45.00]I'll see you tomorrow.
[251:47.16]If you grab the game, check out the contest and I'll see you tomorrow at 10 a.m.
[251:54.40]See you soon.
[251:55.06]Have a great one.
[251:56.51]You're doing the NPC routine again.
[251:58.01]I know.
[252:00.51]Yes, that's just how it is.
[252:01.69]Alright.
[252:08.76]Take it easy.
[252:09.26]Have a good rest of your day.
[252:11.64]See you tomorrow.
[252:24.01]Yeah, what I'm going to do tonight, I'll kind of do some blueprinting.
[252:27.27]Because I have to have a good idea.
[252:31.73]A few things have popped up.
[252:32.73]It's like we've heard, you know, are you going to have Wiggles house?
[252:36.49]We can do a saw house.
[252:38.57]I got to do some blueprinting.
[252:40.33]I got to figure out what I want.
[252:45.07]I don't know if I want to do a saw house.
[252:46.59]I don't know.
[252:48.32]It kind of has to just come to me.
[252:51.20]And if that's tonight or if that's tomorrow, we'll see.
[252:57.71]Already did saw.
[252:58.60]Yeah.
[252:59.32]Did do a Muppets house.
[253:03.02]Hmm.
[253:06.94]Doesn't need to be a house either.
[253:10.56]Right.
[253:11.68]The total freedom you get in sandbox.
[253:13.16]It could be anything.
[253:19.31]Alright.
[253:21.69]See you guys tomorrow morning.
[253:23.13]Have a good day.
[253:25.53]Take care.
[253:25.97]Take it easy.
[254:03.56]I'm back for a second.
[254:05.62]It's kind of funny.
[254:06.14]This image, this theming that I have is usually always based on the stream ending at night.
[254:12.94]So not quite time for bed.
[254:16.92]I'm not really used to streaming at 10 o'clock in the morning.
[254:23.81]It's time to sleep already.
[254:25.49]Alright.
[254:27.21]See you later.
[254:41.08]you
