[ve:60.16.100]

[00:05.06]Are we live?
[00:08.33]That was weird.
[00:10.87]Well.
[00:12.67]Uh, hi.
[00:14.47]I think we're live.
[00:15.27]I hope we're live.
[00:17.53]Something went wrong there.
[00:22.11]What?
[00:22.49]Seriously?
[00:25.24]Seriously what?
[00:28.14]Is Ronnie playing?
[00:32.38]Oh my god.
[00:36.08]Stream's over.
[00:36.76]I don't want to play with Ronnie.
[00:39.30]Okay.
[00:39.54]Oh, you're not playing.
[00:40.12]Okay.
[00:40.26]I'm going to mute him for a second.
[00:42.42]Apparently I'm live.
[00:43.16]That was really odd.
[00:49.78]For some reason.
[00:54.57]Don't ask me why.
[00:57.97]But good evening.
[00:58.67]Good afternoon.
[00:59.31]How are you?
[01:02.15]Good to see you guys again.
[01:06.84]We're going to play some Earth Defense Force tonight.
[01:10.16]You know.
[01:10.64]You know the one.
[01:12.98]Let me just close my door.
[01:22.09]Make a tweet.
[01:25.13]And we can get going.
[01:26.33]We're going to have a full party of four people tonight, by the way.
[01:33.21]It looks like we're going to have four people in the game at the same time.
[01:41.41]Alright, let's move this way.
[01:43.61]I believe the game is already open.
[01:51.27]Or is it?
[01:53.97]But yeah, Arcadum, Star, and Ronnie want Ronnie.
[01:58.81]I believe are the gentlemen that are going to be joining us.
[02:05.61]Alright, here we go.
[02:06.61]I'm going to unmute them, and I'm going to unmute myself.
[02:09.52]Let's go ahead and do it.
[02:11.94]It's pretty good stuff.
[02:13.02]Hi, where did Ronnie go?
[02:15.76]He left.
[02:16.50]Wait, did you kick Ronnie out?
[02:19.61]Well, my mic was muted, but I was going to cancel my stream if Ronnie was playing.
[02:22.97]What?
[02:24.71]Why?
[02:25.11]It was all going to shut down.
[02:26.13]Alright, whatever.
[02:29.77]I have to come up with him enough.
[02:32.23]That would have been fun.
[02:39.55]Alright, I'm live.
[02:41.99]Let's get the game going here.
[02:44.73]I've been alive for like 20 plus years.
[02:47.91]That's a long time.
[02:49.73]It is a long time.
[02:51.35]Alright, you got a game?
[02:55.35]Let me boot that up.
[02:56.07]I was waiting for you.
[02:56.69]I didn't know when you were going to...
[03:05.46]We're a little bit behind here.
[03:06.64]Whose fault is it?
[03:07.48]Who's to blame?
[03:08.82]A little bit behind?
[03:09.78]What are you talking about?
[03:14.08]We're just... We are a tad... That's a big 10-4, good buddy.
[03:19.22]We are a tad bit behind.
[03:20.44]Not even 7 o'clock!
[03:25.70]Make it on hard.
[03:26.25]We can name the game.
[03:27.17]Name it something cool.
[03:30.33]Name it something cool.
[03:31.57]Like... Murder Giraffe.
[03:34.40]Maybe something cool like... Stuffed Crust Pizza.
[03:38.45]Wait, what?
[03:40.21]Stuffed Crust Pizza.
[03:42.31]Whoa.
[03:42.47]Man, we're moving out of the world.
[03:44.35]I haven't had Stuffed Crust Pizza in a long time.
[03:45.91]Maybe we're at Pizza Hut and now we're going to Stuffed Crust Pizza?
[03:48.23]Who's the other player?
[03:48.85]That's Arcadum.
[03:49.29]I'm just going to name it the usual.
[03:51.21]Arcadum, can you introduce yourself to the people that have no idea who you are on my stream?
[03:56.93]Give an introduction.
[03:58.10]I want like a full paragraph introduction.
[04:00.96]Who, me?
[04:01.52]Oh, yeah.
[04:04.22]Wait, what?
[04:08.27]Okay.
[04:09.39]Beginning from life to where you are now.
[04:10.91]Introducing new character.
[04:12.83]Introducing new character.
[04:14.13]Alright.
[04:16.12]Hailing from the darkened lands of Dungeons & Dragons.
[04:18.82]Rising up like a phoenix into the sky.
[04:21.56]I am Arcadum.
[04:23.77]And I'm the friends.
[04:24.91]Hello.
[04:26.45]Everybody say hi.
[04:28.83]Wave right in his fucking face.
[04:31.53]Are you guys ready to join the thing?
[04:34.43]I'm looking forward to it.
[04:36.76]I know a resize.
[04:37.64]Shut up, Shaq!
[04:38.66]Is it called Joby Squad?
[04:40.86]Which one are we going?
[04:43.66]I don't see anything.
[04:44.58]You didn't make nothing.
[04:45.92]You're making us a little late here.
[04:48.20]We're running out of time.
[04:57.09]Here comes the new character!
[04:58.63]Alright, I see Pizza Hut.
[04:59.83]Why is it on Inferno?
[05:02.59]I can switch it.
[05:03.51]Calm down.
[05:03.97]Don't scare us like that, man.
[05:05.61]I don't see Pizza Hut anywhere.
[05:07.63]Oh, there it is.
[05:08.31]Okay.
[05:10.95]Can we all agree Pizza Hut is the grossest?
[05:13.41]Yeah.
[05:13.65]Or Domino's?
[05:14.21]Which one?
[05:14.59]Which one are you voting for?
[05:15.73]Pizza Hut is probably grossest.
[05:17.99]Grosser than Domino's.
[05:18.92]I think Domino's is better than Pizza Hut myself.
[05:22.46]But that's only because Pizza Hut is the only restaurant I've ever been to where I actually found my...
[05:27.37]Pieces of things in the food.
[05:31.73]Level 58.
[05:33.89]Yeah, we're level 58 Inferno.
[05:34.97]Are you ready?
[05:36.35]We didn't even complete level 29.
[05:37.39]Level 58 on Inferno.
[05:39.47]You ready?
[05:39.89]What?
[05:40.59]I'm not ready.
[05:42.17]Oh, he's not ready.
[05:43.91]Alright.
[05:44.61]Thank you, SavvySultan, for 10 months.
[05:47.43]ZirconiumFlash, thanks for two months.
[05:48.89]Feistel, thanks for three months.
[05:51.81]SamN, thanks for the bits.
[05:53.19]No, we're doing just a regular old hard.
[05:57.12]We've got to get our feet wet, right?
[05:59.18]Alright, hard.
[05:59.94]We'll do hard then.
[06:01.53]What weapon should I bring?
[06:03.75]Are my twin spears good for here?
[06:07.18]I actually don't know.
[06:07.90]I haven't played this yet.
[06:08.46]I gotta be honest, I don't remember this mission.
[06:10.06]I think it's dropships and ant holes.
[06:13.80]Okay, hold on.
[06:14.78]And barriers around the ant holes, so you probably just could go in there and blast some things with your spears.
[06:18.59]Okay, let me recalibrate my weaponry.
[06:24.06]Hey, SFM James!
[06:24.54]Oh, that's a big 10-4, good buddy!
[06:26.42]Thanks to the 11 months, dude.
[06:27.39]That's a big ol' 10-4.
[06:29.19]What's the item limit?
[06:31.23]And Awesomeness 591.
[06:32.67]5?
[06:32.69]33.
[06:33.03]33?
[06:33.05]33 right now.
[06:36.39]Thank you, Awesomeness, for 10 months.
[06:38.58]To save our Mother Earth from alien attack from vicious giant insects.
[06:40.98]Yeah, it would be, wouldn't it?
[06:41.84]Once again, come back, Will.
[06:42.88]FG-9.
[06:43.04]Should I go with my Gatling guns?
[06:45.64]Fuck yeah.
[06:47.16]No, there's... Yeah, this is off-schedule.
[06:49.11]I think I'll go with the Bloodstorm.
[06:50.73]We're just gonna play.
[06:51.63]Never use the limpet chaingun.
[06:52.91]I'm sure it's painful to use.
[06:54.95]All the limpet guns are like limpdick guns.
[06:57.75]The limpdick guns.
[06:59.25]Don't do that.
[07:00.17]Yeah.
[07:00.63]Oh, by the way, Arcade, on Jerma's stream, I know usually you're an extremely vulgar person.
[07:05.92]What?
[07:06.14]And extremely offensive.
[07:07.96]He's gonna have to ask you to calm down.
[07:09.68]Can we have PG?
[07:11.86]Oh, I'm sorry.
[07:13.58]It better be fucking PG over here.
[07:15.52]Wait.
[07:18.76]If I hear any fucking parental guidance over, then you are in deep shit.
[07:24.82]Yeah, any talk of, like, baby bopping some preteens or anything.
[07:29.12]Okay.
[07:29.58]Oh, yeah.
[07:30.28]This one is hard, actually.
[07:31.70]Very far away.
[07:32.52]Which way are they coming from?
[07:33.45]We gotta get these ant holes.
[07:36.29]Which way are we going?
[07:37.13]I'm going to get the ant hole over here.
[07:38.21]What?
[07:39.23]There's ant holes everywhere.
[07:40.53]Alright, I'm gonna go take the one to the north, then.
[07:48.11]Or should we all stay here?
[07:48.97]I'll help you.
[07:49.99]Until you get your mech up.
[07:53.25]Yeah, this gun's gonna suck.
[07:58.25]The blood storm coming!
[08:00.37]This isn't a city.
[08:03.63]I'll never come back to you guys.
[08:05.75]I'm in too much trouble.
[08:06.61]Too much trouble bombing stuff over here.
[08:09.11]We're gonna have to go after the animals together, probably.
[08:11.11]Yeah, I just realized it.
[08:12.25]Especially with the wheelbarrow in this game.
[08:15.59]Wheelbarrow?
[08:17.35]Yeah.
[08:21.64]It just has a lot of health.
[08:26.32]Let's do something useful and take these trees down so I can see.
[08:29.82]Do some trimming.
[08:31.74]You got him.
[08:32.58]Watch out!
[08:32.87]Can you get this guy?
[08:38.59]Thank you.
[08:41.95]Climbing up the mountain.
[08:45.78]Which one do you guys want to go to first?
[08:46.76]Reloading my spears.
[08:48.42]I'm trying to hit the one across the way.
[08:50.28]It's probably half dead already.
[08:51.06]There's one on your back.
[08:51.76]I got him.
[08:53.42]Oh, kill him.
[08:54.80]I got you.
[08:57.74]Oh, careful.
[08:58.16]Alright, the one down there.
[09:00.49]There's a help for you there, Jeremy, to your right.
[09:02.23]Thank you.
[09:03.77]This thing does not aim properly.
[09:05.35]Alright, I'm going in.
[09:05.95]Cover me.
[09:06.63]I actually don't really like this spreader.
[09:08.13]I don't like it at all.
[09:11.65]The double is not making me happy.
[09:14.43]That Widowmaker looks different.
[09:17.59]Good one.
[09:18.69]Jesus!
[09:19.09]Yes!
[09:25.03]Wow!
[09:26.25]Okay, we got one of them.
[09:27.20]Yeah, I don't like the double blaster.
[09:30.92]It's too inaccurate.
[09:38.42]The fuck is this?
[09:39.44]It's a giant ass!
[09:40.60]Oh, there's a weapon.
[09:43.31]Woo!
[09:43.91]Got it!
[09:45.57]Watch out behind you, Trevor!
[09:46.75]Dude, you just saved me, dude.
[09:47.94]What do I owe you, 10 bucks?
[09:50.64]It's 10 bucks to play D.Va.
[09:52.22]It's 5 bucks to thank me.
[09:55.40]Alright, give me a second.
[09:56.20]I want to collect some things.
[10:00.35]This gun sucks balls.
[10:09.54]We're gonna have to start making our way, um... Uh, there's no directions on our compass.
[10:13.74]Damn it!
[10:13.96]Game sucks.
[10:14.52]Game sucks.
[10:14.92]I'm coming!
[10:15.28]I'm coming for you!
[10:16.58]What, what, what level do you have to do to unlock the compass directions?
[10:19.35]I got you, Jeremy, don't worry.
[10:24.63]You wanna, do you wanna go up to the one to the left or to the right?
[10:26.65]Which one do you wanna go to?
[10:27.39]The one I'm shooting at and going to.
[10:29.27]Keep him off my back.
[10:30.58]I got you.
[10:34.51]I hate this gun.
[10:36.09]I like this one.
[10:36.81]I fucking hate the other one so much.
[10:39.55]You should use that.
[10:40.69]It's better.
[10:41.33]Reloading my rockets.
[10:42.99]This thing just shoots in a V. I do not like it.
[10:48.71]Unleashing hell.
[10:53.93]Oh, he grabbed me.
[10:55.81]Punch him in the face.
[11:00.72]Did we get that one?
[11:01.44]I think I got it.
[11:02.60]Aggie, that guy's pretty dead.
[11:06.48]Oh, help!
[11:07.10]Arcade him!
[11:08.34]Oh, I'm coming!
[11:13.27]Don't worry!
[11:14.07]Wait, what?
[11:14.75]Ow, my leg!
[11:15.11]Lasted.
[11:17.17]One more, right?
[11:18.79]Yeah.
[11:20.11]I don't hate the bee.
[11:22.13]Come on, man.
[11:24.37]Come on, man.
[11:24.93]You know Jerma's a proud sponsor of G2A now?
[11:28.69]No, come on!
[11:30.77]Don't slander me like that.
[11:32.21]Alright, where are we going?
[11:34.75]This way?
[11:35.45]Up top?
[11:37.27]It's funny.
[11:38.15]I support this company that's considered slander.
[11:40.91]Stop slandering me.
[11:43.63]That's bad.
[11:44.07]I'm taking up this hill.
[11:54.71]You don't get there one day.
[11:56.82]I want more of these things.
[11:58.24]I love the electro zap guns.
[11:59.80]Oh, hello.
[12:01.08]Who wants to fucking dance?
[12:03.92]I'm not very good.
[12:05.25]I can die.
[12:09.15]Hold on.
[12:12.31]We're just playing The Climb, the new VR experience for only $50.
[12:16.18]You watch this.
[12:17.20]Watch me.
[12:17.70]Wait.
[12:17.94]Okay.
[12:18.14]Where are you?
[12:19.00]You're in trouble.
[12:19.46]I'm over here fighting these guys.
[12:21.10]Come on, you piece of... Come on.
[12:24.22]Grabbing me, that's exactly what I want you to do.
[12:26.08]Dremma actually sponsored by G2, I know.
[12:29.16]I'm not sponsored by anybody.
[12:32.70]No, now people are going to think that's true, and I'm going to get deep trouble.
[12:35.44]Dremma's only sponsored by Zap.
[12:37.22]Yeah, well, we're through.
[12:38.78]We're one of those two.
[12:39.54]I already have a sponsor.
[12:42.36]Alright, I'm going to go up and I'm going to go for this one.
[12:45.33]I'm going to go for a slam.
[12:46.27]I'm going straight for him.
[12:47.71]Let me just shoot a V. Let me just shoot a V for no reason.
[12:52.07]I think I missed the artillery anyway.
[12:53.32]No, I got it.
[12:53.86]Let's get an artillery.
[12:58.68]Oh, is it dead?
[13:05.11]Die.
[13:07.89]Oh, man.
[13:08.23]You just call us the Squashers.
[13:10.57]Call us the Squashers.
[13:12.93]Help me.
[13:13.24]Help me.
[13:14.56]I got your back.
[13:15.04]Don't worry.
[13:16.67]Wow, Arcadum.
[13:18.35]Come on, Arcadum.
[13:20.31]Watch out for these.
[13:20.75]There's one more.
[13:22.05]Wait, wait, wait.
[13:23.59]We did it.
[13:23.89]We did it.
[13:26.86]Wow.
[13:28.04]Sweat beating down my forehead.
[13:35.62]Sponsored by Failfish.
[13:36.94]Who didn't pick up gear?
[13:38.64]I did.
[13:39.12]There wasn't very much of it.
[13:40.70]Yeah, I didn't see anything.

[14:09.85]I like this one.
[14:10.65]What's this?
[14:13.76]Yeah, we could try that.
[14:14.74]But you're going to need your twin spears or something like that to go in later.
[14:17.82]So what's going on this level?
[14:20.74]Tons of the big walker guys, and after you clear two waves of them, they walk at you again, but they get the shields as well.
[14:27.60]Okay.
[14:28.86]I wish I had something better than this.
[14:30.68]I wish I could use my Geist.
[14:32.36]That thing is insane.
[14:33.22]Alright, so basically what we're going to do here, Jerma, I'm going to be strapping in with a gigantic set of missiles that deal 50,000 damage a shot, so be very careful.
[14:45.59]Okay.
[14:46.81]Well, you're not going to want to walk forward anyway.
[14:48.29]You've got some long-range stuff for the start.
[14:50.24]Yep, let me see.
[14:51.14]I'll switch off Bloodstorm.
[14:53.84]Ah, okay.
[14:54.14]I'm cut off from the Big Lebite, and I'm just short of that, so I have to use the smaller one.
[14:58.44]What are you guys even talking about?
[14:59.78]This doesn't make any sense to me.
[15:02.70]Should I bring some grenades?
[15:06.75]You know what?
[15:07.19]Actually, I think I'm going to use the Haytel multi-missile.
[15:11.01]I'm going to use that instead.
[15:14.66]I can't use the Leviathan.
[15:15.68]Really important to know the mechs can dance.
[15:18.24]Oh, can the mechs dance?
[15:20.02]Uh, yeah.
[15:21.00]I mean, I could... Whatever, I'm just gonna have to be... I'm gonna just be sniping the whole time.
[15:26.93]Oh, you're just gonna be in the wheelbarrow, okay.
[15:29.89]I'm gonna... Okay, Jerma, do you have, like, a very close-range high-damage weapon?
[15:35.96]Yes.
[15:37.10]Grenade, take one of those.
[15:38.50]Because me and you, we're all going to join the friend team.
[15:42.20]We're going to drive a tank in, because it can hold two of you, and you jump out.
[15:45.66]You know what I'm saying?
[15:48.08]I guess.
[15:49.62]We're going to have to go forward.
[15:50.74]Friend team, just listen.
[15:52.02]Just trust me.
[15:53.20]Well, I have a long-range ultra sniper.
[15:54.92]You don't want me to be using that?
[15:56.70]No, because they get the fucking barrier shields later.
[15:58.90]You're not listening.
[15:59.74]Oh, would you just play?
[16:01.06]Gotta give them the LOL.
[16:04.40]Karma doesn't deserve the LOL.
[16:06.36]Oh, the, uh... Somebody was asking if you were drinking, Star.
[16:09.68]Are you drinking?
[16:11.68]I wish.
[16:13.38]Alright, where are you putting your markup?
[16:16.55]Uh, going for the far left, boy.
[16:18.25]Far left?
[16:18.65]Okay, set him up.
[16:22.43]Is it on him?
[16:23.79]I don't know if I'm in range.
[16:24.83]I don't think I'm in range.
[16:25.43]There's so many of these things.
[16:26.69]We might have to get closer here.
[16:27.75]I'm getting closer.
[16:32.78]Huh.
[16:33.28]Okay, well...
[16:35.85]Oh.
[16:36.63]That one came out of nowhere.
[16:37.65]I mean, I... Which one are you guys shooting at right now?
[16:42.65]I'm gonna start working from the left to the right.
[16:44.51]That's probably a good idea.
[16:46.95]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[16:49.50]Oh shit.
[16:50.58]I was too busy like looking at this.
[16:53.74]I wasn't looking at the shit in the air.
[16:59.12]Okay, one of them actually has the thing on him now.
[17:01.42]Wait, no, I reloaded.
[17:02.30]Did I get rid of it?
[17:03.08]Fuck, I'm an idiot.
[17:08.64]Okay.
[17:09.06]I have it on him.
[17:10.18]Okay.
[17:10.56]Looking for it.
[17:17.47]Here you go.
[17:20.89]Going in.
[17:26.11]He uses too much power to reload this.
[17:27.61]Okay.
[17:27.71]That guy's done.
[17:28.81]Oh, so much screen shake.
[17:29.95]I can't see anything.
[17:31.01]My character sucks asshole here, by the way.
[17:33.49]Okay.
[17:33.75]He's down.
[17:34.31]That guy's down.
[17:34.90]Next target.
[17:39.48]I threw a couple of them out there.
[17:45.26]Jerma, if you're useless, you can get in my tank.
[17:47.43]I mean, I'm sniping there.
[17:48.85]This thing does like 2,000 damage a shot, but it takes so much to reload.
[17:57.85]Ah, come on.
[18:01.17]We've just started playing.
[18:02.68]I'm useless, guys.
[18:03.62]Well, right now I am.
[18:13.39]Throw down another.
[18:15.69]Hold on.
[18:19.77]I'm working the left as hard as I can here, but I might have to start switching to blast spears.
[18:24.05]I'm going to hide in here.
[18:29.59]I'm actually better off probably being on the gunner here.
[18:32.92]The headache gun?
[18:33.72]Yeah, the headache gun.
[18:34.48]I dropped a whole tank for you.
[18:39.29]Yeah, there's smoke.
[18:39.87]We're getting another tank.
[18:41.51]Oh, no.
[18:41.81]There's one right here, too.
[18:44.15]Yeah.
[18:44.89]I didn't know you could have that many this quickly.
[18:47.55]Well, we're killing a lot of things.
[18:50.61]I'm really hurt.
[18:51.15]You guys see any health anywhere?
[18:52.72]It would all be up there.
[18:55.48]Yeah, it's gonna be all around them.
[18:56.98]Alright.
[18:57.70]Setting up for rockets.
[19:00.76]Okay, we're at the point where rockets aren't gonna be good anymore because the next one's coming out of the barriers.
[19:04.62]Okay.
[19:05.78]Rocking and rolling.
[19:09.11]Gonna have to go looking for some help.
[19:10.77]Yeah, even if you give me a tank, I can't drive it.
[19:12.99]And this machine gun's not that great right now.
[19:14.87]It's not close enough.
[19:16.18]Rangers should be able to drive it.
[19:17.38]I'm not a ranger.
[19:18.78]Oh, yeah.
[19:19.80]I remember the days where you were a ranger.
[19:21.62]Alright, I need to go in and get rid of that, right?
[19:26.84]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[19:28.64]Come to my tank.
[19:31.02]I'm gonna drive us in.
[19:33.11]You ready for glory?
[19:35.13]I'm ready.
[19:35.57]I guess I'm ready for glory.
[19:38.56]Where are the shields?
[19:39.06]Where'd they go?
[19:39.42]Are they all over in the back?
[19:43.14]They grow when you try and bomb them.
[19:45.84]Alright, well, I'm ready.
[19:46.50]Are you arcading them?
[19:47.52]I'm over here.
[19:48.32]I'm just picking up items.
[19:50.22]Just picking up items.
[19:51.26]Getting the other tank?
[19:52.10]Oh, I see it.
[19:53.76]Alright, I'm here.
[19:54.14]Alright, you want me to come to you guys?
[19:57.91]Uh, you could probably be on your own.
[20:00.41]Yeah, I'm fine.
[20:01.13]I'm just picking up items and stuff.
[20:03.29]So you want me just to go and just bee sting the hell out of the, uh,
[20:07.29]Yeah, okay.
[20:08.47]I might get smoked because there's so many of them.
[20:10.79]Alright, I'm going to start attacking the ones on the right and see if I can work them down.
[20:18.90]Hopefully this thing does enough damage.
[20:24.82]You can go through the barrier, right?
[20:26.36]Physically?
[20:26.76]Yeah.
[20:27.40]Okay.
[20:27.94]We're going for this one in the back.
[20:29.02]I don't even think we're going to go in the back left.
[20:31.24]Are those things generating the barriers?
[20:33.29]Yeah.
[20:33.99]Oh, I'm going for those.
[20:35.11]Yeah.
[20:36.22]Be careful, because they will probably instantly kill you.
[20:38.68]Oh, jeez.
[20:38.94]Okay, never mind.
[20:39.54]Yep.
[20:40.22]Alright, here I am going.
[20:40.97]Oh, my God.
[20:43.15]Just leave me behind.
[20:50.11]Oh, jeez.
[20:50.41]Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.
[20:52.15]Wow.
[20:52.77]I didn't expect it to die that fast.
[20:54.19]Oh, watch out.
[20:54.61]There's a big dude right there.
[20:55.47]I'm just going to wrap around and just... You keep that guy busy.
[21:00.33]I'm going to get this other one.
[21:02.54]Trying to keep busy.
[21:03.94]Keep it busy, keep it busy, keep it busy.
[21:11.65]It's dead.
[21:14.55]Is there another one?
[21:15.57]Fuck, there's another one back there.
[21:18.49]There's a ton of them.
[21:19.73]Okay, I'm just going to stay in the back line and just try to get them all.
[21:23.67]Oh, fuck.
[21:25.87]Oh yeah, they blow up when they die, don't they?
[21:29.01]I'm coming to you, Jerma.
[21:30.01]I'm just trying.
[21:30.69]You're in the dog pile right now.
[21:31.99]That's fine.
[21:32.67]That's fine.
[21:33.91]There's a guy coming for you, Jerma.
[21:35.27]There's one just right behind me.
[21:36.68]Can you just shoot that guy in the ass?
[21:39.26]He's looking at me now.
[21:40.24]Good.
[21:43.98]Ooh, crotch shot.
[21:44.92]Dude, dick shot streamer.
[21:46.26]Alright, that's it.
[21:46.78]They're all dead.
[21:49.17]Alright, ready?
[21:50.63]Oh, fuck.
[21:53.83]Now I can sit back and snipe.
[21:57.19]I might be able to get you in a second here.
[22:00.77]I could probably go get him.
[22:05.35]So do the ants pilot the robots?
[22:09.11]Yeah, the ants are the ones flying.
[22:10.63]They're the ones inside the mechs.
[22:13.89]Stop dying, Arcadian.
[22:15.19]I got him.
[22:15.57]I can get him.
[22:17.77]Wish me luck.
[22:20.94]Wish you luck.
[22:21.42]There's also a lot of... Oh my god, there's another wave.
[22:23.53]Are you serious?
[22:24.69]Oh shit.
[22:26.95]I thought that was it.
[22:28.21]Oh, there's ants.
[22:29.51]You must release the Criken.
[22:32.88]Running for health.
[22:36.48]There's a bunch of health on the ground.
[22:39.82]Alright, now, that's all shit.
[22:42.00]There's so many ants.
[22:44.22]Okay, I'm running this way.
[22:46.10]I'm doing the G2A.
[22:48.06]GTA, drive backwards.
[22:50.26]Stop saying G2A.
[22:52.24]I can't.
[22:54.66]Glory!
[22:56.42]Stop saying G2A.
[22:57.63]I don't like it.
[22:58.15]It doesn't push the railgun.
[23:01.27]I'm coming.
[23:01.63]You know what?
[23:02.83]I'm going to collect items because there's so much shit we didn't get.
[23:08.56]There's a lot of stuff back here.
[23:11.36]Oh, jeez.
[23:11.92]What the... Well, make sure you don't die.
[23:14.28]Oh, I'm using the really bad... There's no enemies over here.
[23:17.78]That's why.
[23:18.70]Okay.
[23:20.20]You know what this is?
[23:21.46]Santa drove by here and somebody shot him with a rocket.
[23:25.06]These are like all the presents for all the kids.
[23:29.50]There are a lot of presents out here.
[23:33.02]If you guys can keep them busy, then I can get most of them.
[23:41.42]Are you alright over there?
[23:42.20]You need me to come?
[23:42.90]I'm coming to get you.
[23:44.76]I should be fine.
[23:45.92]Not him.
[23:47.00]He's, uh... I may have bombed myself.
[23:51.94]Don't die!
[23:52.44]Don't die!
[23:53.76]Star!
[23:56.24]Star!
[23:57.66]I'm fine.
[23:58.08]Star!
[23:59.34]I'm fine.
[23:59.70]I don't have any... I can't really deal with this.
[24:01.60]Yeah, I shouldn't have went with the rockets on this one.
[24:05.19]I should have just went for, like, my Gatling guns or my, uh... I didn't know there were ants at the end.
[24:13.15]Get me!
[24:15.03]This lance actually is pretty, pretty, pretty good.
[24:21.02]Although I'm in deep shit right now.
[24:23.00]Why?
[24:23.68]You fool!
[24:26.92]Doing the drive backwards.
[24:28.50]I'm in trouble.
[24:31.89]Deep trouble.
[24:32.67]I'm gonna get caught.
[24:34.09]No, no, I'm hiding in the bodies.
[24:39.09]Okay.
[24:40.43]Can you get Arcade him or should I get him?
[24:41.95]I'm going to get him.
[24:43.55]We're way over here.
[24:44.55]Holy shit.
[24:45.11]Where were you?
[24:46.41]I... I... I fought a swarm.
[24:50.92]There's a... Don't... Don't... These things!
[24:53.74]Yeah, I should definitely have not chosen the rockets I did.
[24:56.14]Oh, look in the air.
[24:57.22]Oh, God.
[24:57.70]I know.
[24:58.02]We're not even prepared for this.
[25:02.40]We're not ready for this shit.
[25:04.17]This... Come on.
[25:08.91]Well... I should have picked better weapons.
[25:10.71]We are... We are... We are... You know... In trouble, as they say.
[25:17.27]Arcadum, I can get you.
[25:18.43]Just give me 30 seconds.
[25:20.15]No, that's way too long.
[25:21.39]10 seconds.
[25:26.21]Although, you know what?
[25:28.59]What's the, uh, what's the animal?
[25:30.36]What's the bug that eats the other bugs that's a big bug and it flies and eats the flying bugs?
[25:35.16]Um... Uh... Uh... You know what I mean.
[25:43.48]Yes!
[25:43.90]Yeah, dragonfly.
[25:44.74]I'm a dragonfly and these are mosquitoes.
[25:47.35]Okay.
[25:49.07]Why are you here?
[25:50.27]Oh, a mosquito eater.
[25:51.51]I was fighting a whole swarm over here.
[25:52.95]Stay in there, stay in there, Star.
[25:53.75]I'll get him.
[25:59.07]Alright, time to be the mosquito eater.
[26:03.07]Okay.
[26:04.19]Can I stop for a second?
[26:06.89]I have no weapons because I have the freaking... You're not out of my reach.
[26:10.71]...guide gun for you.
[26:12.03]Don't worry.
[26:13.39]Dr. Mosquito's here.
[26:18.84]Get him, Dr. Mosquito.
[26:20.60]Dr. Mosquito's in trouble.
[26:21.74]Dr. Mosquito's dead.
[26:27.52]I killed like 10 of them though.
[26:29.12]Star, it's up to you.
[26:33.00]Dude, it's a good thing I stream so people can actually watch the game.
[26:36.91]Oh my god.
[26:46.35]I'm coming to get ya.
[26:52.99]Alright, Arcadum, here I come.
[26:57.08]Life!
[26:58.20]No, I'm getting the hell out of here.
[26:59.42]I'm gonna go pick up health and shit.
[27:00.92]Good luck.
[27:01.82]Roger that.
[27:03.91]I will also do that.
[27:06.23]No, I can't.
[27:07.33]That was a mistake.
[27:09.51]I'm going to my tank.
[27:10.67]I got tanks everywhere.
[27:11.65]If I move around like a fucking idiot, they won't be able to hit me, though.
[27:13.55]Look at... Look at that.
[27:15.79]You gotta use the idiot strategy sometimes, guys.
[27:18.46]Out of my range, I don't think I can hit that guy.
[27:19.82]I've been being an idiot for like five minutes now.
[27:24.08]Get out of here.
[27:31.65]Alright, I'm okay.
[27:35.61]Oh God, this tank has like no health in it.
[27:37.39]There's more?
[27:39.01]This... This is not fair.
[27:44.70]There's too many things.
[27:47.68]You can't give us this many things.
[27:50.66]And I just have the wrong weapons for this.
[27:56.76]I mean, I'm alright.
[27:58.48]What the f- No, I'm not alright.
[28:00.38]Fuck, right when I say it.
[28:01.40]I thought I was in the air high enough.
[28:02.52]I'm coming for you, Jerma.
[28:06.68]I got a beacon on one of them.
[28:08.04]Oh, there's a giant wave of hands, too.
[28:10.18]It's because I spawned, like, right fucking next to these dumb things.
[28:13.64]I'm coming.
[28:14.56]You're gonna be in deep trouble.
[28:16.60]What are you doing?
[28:19.01]Why did you leave?
[28:19.47]What are you doing?
[28:24.87]Get better weapons.
[28:26.27]What?
[28:27.10]We are definitely about to die again.
[28:29.22]We could have taken that out.
[28:30.02]I was in a perpetual state of dying and I was never going to get another vehicle.
[28:34.07]Alright, let's see here.
[28:36.75]Are we on hardest or hard?
[28:38.75]I want to change off my guide beacon.
[28:40.87]Are we on hardest or hard?
[28:44.73]Hard.
[28:45.07]I wish I could use my rapier.
[28:50.92]You know we were going to die.
[28:51.96]I don't know.
[28:53.96]You all know it was over.
[28:55.28]That was a real coward move.
[28:57.68]Only one of us was on the ground.
[28:58.98]I was going to get revived.
[29:01.56]Come on, man.
[29:03.70]What the heck is that, man?
[29:07.04]Since there are those flying things, I'm going to have to go full Rocket Boy, I think.
[29:13.05]I'm just going to be Dr. Mosquito the whole time.
[29:15.59]Dr. Mosquito.
[29:17.03]The very first part of this, I'm going to be useless, but once the shields come in and the air units come in, then I'll be able to actually do things.
[29:24.84]Are you going to be able to destroy the thingies?
[29:27.54]Yes.
[29:27.92]I'm still going to keep with the tank.
[29:29.54]The thingies will die in less than five seconds.
[29:32.66]Just like those Overwatch Dodgers.
[29:34.54]SMH.
[29:36.12]Cole, get a life.
[29:39.77]Got him.
[29:41.67]Got him.
[29:46.24]You can tell Jerm is actually a little mad beyond the jokes.
[29:54.14]I might actually be able to be a mosquito over here.
[29:58.61]No, I'm just going to get in your tank.
[30:00.59]Are we going to focus on one side and work our way over again?
[30:02.93]Yeah, I'm going to go to the left side.
[30:05.63]I'm going left as well.
[30:10.34]Still not in range.
[30:14.50]Watch out, this is like raining hell right in the spot that you put that tank down.
[30:18.64]You're like, you're gonna get, it's gonna like snipe you.
[30:20.48]Okay, I'll tell them to move the tank then.
[30:22.28]You almost get sniped, dude.
[30:25.54]Alright, I'm getting in your tank just so I don't die.
[30:30.00]What's the range on the headache gun?
[30:31.38]Not very good.
[30:33.30]I have no idea.
[30:34.62]Not many people, yeah, it doesn't look very good.
[30:36.92]Not many people have been able to survive the headache gun.
[30:46.56]Yeah, this thing doesn't have any range at all.
[30:48.90]I guess it sort of does right there.
[30:50.88]Now I'm doing some work.
[31:02.86]It's not even going that far.
[31:04.36]No, it's not.
[31:06.08]At least I can pretend I'm doing something for the beginning.
[31:14.70]Whoops.
[31:16.16]It's not even going that far.
[31:17.24]This thing sucks.
[31:21.22]Oh, there's an invisible wall behind us.
[31:24.02]Yeah, there is.
[31:25.60]We gotta back off.
[31:26.34]We gotta back off.
[31:27.22]We're gonna get caught by this machine gun.
[31:28.84]I ain't getting out of this thing.
[31:30.71]Oh, no.
[31:31.85]You're leaving me.
[31:32.91]Oh, no.
[31:34.55]He's getting bombarded.
[31:36.37]You can't just leave him.
[31:39.07]No man left behind.
[31:41.51]Any wounds?
[31:43.42]If I walked out of this right, you know, you want me to go mosquito?
[31:46.39]I can do it.
[31:48.83]Just keep being a wheelbarrow streamer.
[31:50.47]Like actually in the wheelbarrow.
[31:51.97]Yeah, I'm in the wheelbarrow.
[31:57.57]This is a pretty cool show though.
[31:58.87]I feel like I'm on an on-rails scripted event.
[32:04.24]Any wounds?
[32:07.66]Man, that guy keeps getting baby-bopped.
[32:14.96]Come on.
[32:20.26]Doesn't this look like a Half-Life 2 cutscene?
[32:24.84]This is just awesome.
[32:26.70]I'm at maximum over, yes.
[32:28.56]Right now.
[32:29.04]Here we go.
[32:30.27]Go.
[32:30.57]I'm not out of ammo.
[32:33.51]I can't leave you.
[32:34.17]He'll instantly kill me.
[32:43.35]Alright, there he is.
[32:47.76]You want to drive me over to that one?
[32:48.76]I'm calling in another.
[32:53.22]Good.
[32:55.28]This is going to be harder than we thought.
[32:56.38]There's 1,600 waves to this mission.
[33:00.82]Yeah, why is this mission so long?
[33:09.44]Tank!
[33:11.70]Alright.
[33:12.62]Get me over... to the shield!
[33:19.66]Almost useful.
[33:23.86]All those boxes, though.
[33:25.12]I know, that's what I'm saying.
[33:26.56]Imagine if you didn't have to manually pick up each individual one from directly on top of it.
[33:31.42]Or imagine if it was safe to be out of the vehicle for more than 10 seconds.
[33:36.98]Maybe hard's too hard for you.
[33:39.21]Too hard for you as well, apparently.
[33:41.68]Uh, that massive tank, yeah, Alpha, I can already summon one of those.
[33:45.54]It's just pretty low level.
[33:49.02]Why can't Battlefield be like this?
[33:51.68]Battlefield sucks.
[33:52.54]Why does Arcanum want to play it?
[33:54.60]No, but I mean, like, why can't this be Battlefield?
[33:57.93]Why are you so mean to me?
[33:59.01]I just want to play Battlefield with you.
[34:00.31]I'm mean to Battlefield.
[34:01.33]I wasn't mean to you.
[34:02.31]Take me all the way.
[34:03.31]Take, take, take me boating.
[34:04.59]You know?
[34:05.25]Take me boating.
[34:07.25]Take you from behind.
[34:08.09]Take me, come, come on, dude.
[34:11.55]I always forget, whenever I play a game with Star on stream, he makes like a bunch of sex jokes.
[34:18.65]Do you do this on your own stream?
[34:20.01]I don't think you do.
[34:21.77]I'm still going, I just wanted to drop another tank so I can leave a tank trail.
[34:24.91]Okay, well, I'll get in then.
[34:32.42]I don't even need to get out.
[34:34.84]You can just shoot them.
[34:37.90]Any wounds?
[34:40.46]What?
[34:40.92]What are you doing?
[34:41.54]There was a mine.
[34:42.08]There was a mine in the ground.
[34:46.24]Oh, it's protected.
[34:47.51]Alright, I'm gonna go.
[34:48.85]I'm gonna go chase that one.
[34:49.77]You turn left and shoot that one.
[34:51.53]Alright, so one more.
[35:09.68]That doesn't look right.
[35:10.80]That doesn't look very right at all.
[35:13.50]I'm gonna get back in your tank.
[35:14.52]Which one are you taking?
[35:15.22]The new one?
[35:16.76]No, I'm just... I'm just leaving a trail in case I ever, like, am in danger later.
[35:24.86]We need to go to the right.
[35:25.90]Watch out.
[35:28.50]Be careful of airstrikes.
[35:29.58]Oh, Arcadum.
[35:31.13]Yeah?
[35:31.41]Has 5% health.
[35:34.83]He's had 5% health for a while.
[35:37.05]Has he been there?
[35:37.67]Okay, I'm taking the new tank.
[35:40.17]I'm okay.
[35:40.74]It just landed.
[35:41.50]Why are you treating these tanks like potato chips?
[35:46.12]I want to make sure I got some ammo, you know what I'm saying?
[35:47.94]Oh, that one's deep in there.
[35:49.98]Don't you get me in.
[35:50.86]Oh, oh, I'm going to go all the way around.
[35:53.49]No, that one.
[36:00.25]Come on, get out.
[36:01.59]Step out for a second.
[36:02.55]Come on.
[36:02.89]Let's grab boxes.
[36:06.48]There we go.
[36:09.61]Can you remove a new one?
[36:10.83]No, I still have five emotes.
[36:13.65]Here come the ants.
[36:16.45]One more shot and I can destroy that thing.
[36:18.19]This is so sloppy to aim this around.
[36:20.25]I'm underwater aiming this gun.
[36:32.41]This is ridiculous.
[36:34.39]It's so nice of you, Star, that you'll boost your friends in games.
[36:40.96]Remember how you said, like, aiming things in a vehicle in this game, like you wish you had a controller?
[36:44.74]Yeah.
[36:45.40]Yeah.
[36:57.33]Alright, here come the ants.
[37:00.57]Rocket barrage!
[37:02.23]Can I... Okay, before the mosquitoes come out...
[37:09.70]Mosquitoes.
[37:10.48]You didn't tell me there was going to be mosquitoes.
[37:13.70]Aiming in a vehicle, I'm telling you right now, is very hard to do with a mouse in this game.
[37:22.68]Here we go.
[37:23.18]Especially when it's moving around.
[37:33.37]I know why everyone wanted my point of view.
[37:38.72]Oh, you're such a gamer god, Star.
[37:40.66]That's why P... Yeah, you're so good.
[37:42.27]Yep.
[37:43.73]That's why.
[37:44.25]No, I'm just not a wheelbarrow streamer.
[37:47.85]Keep blowing smoke up your own ass.
[37:56.68]There are hundreds.
[37:58.02]Oh, you don't... You don't say.
[37:59.66]I am caught.
[38:06.83]I'm not caught anymore.
[38:08.03]I'm gonna be caught again?
[38:09.09]Nope, I'm good.
[38:12.46]Jerem, I got a rocket barrage coming to aid you.
[38:14.54]I'm running away from it.
[38:18.56]Jerem is so mad right now.
[38:20.34]I hope that hits something.
[38:33.56]Oh!
[38:35.51]They just hide these rocks everywhere.
[38:41.63]God damn it!
[38:43.43]There's just too many bullets hitting me at the same time.
[38:47.11]Don't worry, Jerm, I'll come get you.
[38:50.39]You know, I love how you're so cocky having like 8,000 HP in that tank.
[38:58.98]I was alive for quite a while without being in the tank before.
[39:03.10]Yeah, you sure can take, like, inhale bullets with your 8,000 fucking health.
[39:08.44]I have 339.
[39:09.02]Okay.
[39:15.76]Go fuck yourself.
[39:22.57]Next time we're all dying, let's do it close together.
[39:33.17]Maybe I'd get to use my tanks if I wasn't trying to save you all the time!
[39:36.32]Dammit.
[39:37.98]I just went for the tank and got inside it.
[39:44.36]No Pacific Rim.
[39:46.68]Oh, Arcadum.
[39:47.62]I'm gonna try.
[39:48.16]I'm gonna try.
[39:49.50]Fight as hard as I could.
[39:50.78]I'm gonna try.
[39:51.26]You know what, Trevor?
[39:53.52]It's just so shattish-fying having 8,000 health.
[39:56.14]I'm sure it is.
[39:59.06]But some of us don't have that much health.
[40:04.96]A little bit
[40:31.55]If I can pick up the help that's all the way I'm gonna get you We're gonna get the hell away from these things
[41:01.42]I'm in deep shit.
[41:04.25]Nice.
[41:04.63]Yeah.
[41:06.01]Yeah.
[41:09.01]I think what I need to do is I need to switch to... I need to have my twin spears and just go with one weapon set just so I can move.
[41:16.51]There's too many explosions.
[41:22.19]We also need to be near each other because we're doing...
[41:25.68]Back to back, either side of the map to rez each other.
[41:30.32]And I'm using my tank as a self-destruct suicide rez device.
[41:34.15]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[41:42.21]Oh, hey, we have tanks.
[41:43.45]No, never mind.
[41:45.11]Ow.
[41:47.05]Well, we're dead.
[41:55.08]Oh, submission.
[41:56.14]Okay.
[41:58.12]Let's see.
[41:59.06]I'm not letting us skip this mission.
[42:01.49]That's fine.
[42:05.95]What can I do besides die?
[42:07.93]I don't know.
[42:13.33]Here's the problem.
[42:14.41]Me and Arcadum just keep getting destroyed.
[42:18.99]We both keep dying.
[42:21.75]I think we all have to be in tanks.
[42:24.69]Here's the solution.
[42:25.45]I have the solution.
[42:30.37]Are you ready for the final solution?
[42:31.61]No, I like what I have now.
[43:00.28]Okay, that looks good.
[43:03.92]I'm going to try this thing.
[43:06.38]If it's bad, I can just use the lance.
[43:07.99]It doesn't matter.
[43:16.89]Change the source code.
[43:19.76]Hey, Eucalyptine, thanks for the sub.
[43:21.20]KingDirtyShorts, thanks for subbing.
[43:26.42]Welcome, guys.
[43:26.92]Alright, let me see what this thing does.
[43:31.94]It's just like a really inaccurate weapon.
[43:34.58]Well, the ice lance is the thing that I'm going to use, so who cares?
[43:41.77]Why don't you care?
[43:42.43]Oh, I do care.
[43:52.71]I'm shooting the ground, Arcadum.
[43:55.40]So apparently this Gatling gun is a cone attack instead of a forward attack like I thought it was going to be.
[44:12.29]I always want to switch to Ranger for this.
[44:17.03]I just die so easily.
[44:31.28]You're playing the engineer.
[44:38.20]Can't even fly over there.
[44:45.20]This guy's playing the engineer.
[44:48.12]He's hitting him.
[44:56.80]Be careful of aerial strikes.
[45:04.88]Friends!
[45:06.32]Come to me!
[45:06.90]Where are you?
[45:14.58]Oh, nice.
[45:15.18]Oh, you're in that gun.
[45:16.28]Nice, nice, nice.
[45:20.32]Let's do it.
[45:21.54]Let's hack.
[45:25.06]We form the Power Ranger Megazord.
[45:31.07]Just don't even leave this thing How is this guy still alive?
[45:59.21]Yeah, they take a lot of hits
[46:05.60]Am I not firing the missiles?
[46:06.94]I don't know.
[46:09.46]I haven't seen you shoot any of them.
[46:12.58]Do you not hold it down?
[46:15.12]Yeah, and then it locks on, then you let go and it goes kablooey.
[46:19.01]Yeah, I think I'm glitched.
[46:20.07]It's not working.
[46:21.21]Alright, we actually have made it pretty far.
[46:22.97]Good thing we have 45,000 health.
[46:24.91]Oh my god.
[46:25.49]Hey, I think what you meant to say, to feed my ghost, thank god we have Star here.
[46:33.31]We're getting in the other one with more ammo and I'm going to walk us in.
[46:39.25]There we go.
[46:39.57]Now I have a gun that doesn't suck.
[46:46.93]Get all those crates.
[46:47.83]Don't worry.
[46:48.15]We'll get most of them.
[46:51.81]We'll get there eventually.
[46:52.79]Don't waste your ammo.
[46:54.21]I'm not.
[46:54.49]God damn it.
[46:59.41]No, this is our first time with this mission.
[47:01.67]Well, first time as in today.
[47:03.77]We haven't seen it.
[47:11.70]Just Bob it up and down.
[47:14.78]I feel like we're in the water.
[47:16.14]We're in a boat right now.
[47:17.46]Yeah, boat fighting.
[47:19.56]Uh-oh.
[47:20.25]This... Okay.
[47:22.61]We just wrecked that guy's shirt.
[47:25.59]He's...
[47:27.74]We can take these guys.
[47:28.86]Look at these nerds.
[47:33.06]That one's still alive.
[47:35.26]Walking forward.
[47:36.81]Shoot it!
[47:38.29]Shoot it!
[47:43.81]We're doing things.
[47:44.67]We're doing it.
[47:52.44]Why did we do this from the very beginning?
[47:55.94]I don't know.
[47:56.58]I thought you were going to be able to play the game.
[48:00.70]Got him.
[48:01.14]Hey, Arcadum, isn't he being a little too infroscupulous?
[48:08.04]I'm unaware of what that word means.
[48:12.48]He's being a little too insproscupulous, okay?
[48:15.48]Insproto?
[48:17.24]He's playing the Ultra Tank, and he's making fun of us for dying.
[48:21.91]Hey, man.
[48:22.91]I just want to punch things.
[48:24.17]Don't you think that's a little inscrut-scrupulous?
[48:26.39]That is a little inscrut-scrupulous.
[48:29.06]The thing you said.
[48:41.92]Somebody looked that up.
[48:42.66]What did I say?
[48:44.84]Shit, he just squatted down.
[48:52.61]Oh my god, this thing.
[48:55.85]Oh god.
[48:56.45]Ants!
[48:56.87]Ants!
[48:57.13]Ants!
[48:57.71]Oh, are they on us?
[48:58.75]Oh, jeez.
[49:00.97]We're so desperately trying to just get in to shoot this guy.
[49:03.72]A weapon to surpass metal!
[49:09.16]That's gonna blow up.
[49:18.05]You guys are fucked.
[49:22.56]Hold on, I'm coming.
[49:24.06]If only he shot it instead of reading chat.
[49:26.12]Got him.
[49:28.62]Get out of there, Star.
[49:29.54]Get out!
[49:30.66]I'm stuck inside of an ant corpse.
[49:32.16]I actually can't go in any direction.
[49:34.78]It vomited on me.
[49:36.17]Alright, here's the strategy.
[49:37.99]Wait, what did you... Strategy.
[49:45.61]Here we go.
[49:48.41]I'm just going to try to get in.
[49:53.16]Right?
[49:54.56]Go for it.
[49:55.82]There's no way to get in.
[49:57.34]Press E!
[49:58.52]Press E!
[50:00.86]Nope.
[50:02.95]You shoot your way up!
[50:07.31]Let go of me!
[50:08.33]Let go of me!
[50:13.05]Come here, you little fucks!
[50:17.72]The gun won't shoot.
[50:19.02]Okay, there we go.
[50:25.12]This is the shit heroes are made of, Jerma!
[50:27.86]No, there's too many!
[50:29.02]There's too many of them!
[50:32.52]It's about to blow again.
[50:33.52]Never surrender!
[50:35.80]It's about to blow again.
[50:36.68]It's over.
[50:38.28]It's over!
[50:42.20]Get me up, Jerma!
[50:43.23]Come here, you motherfucker!
[50:46.81]Get out!
[50:47.61]Get out!
[50:48.91]Get all the- get all the fucking- eat all the Crunch Berries, quick!
[50:53.76]There are so many angry ants.
[50:55.50]Star?
[50:57.95]I'm coming!
[51:00.27]Mom is coming!
[51:03.99]We're doing this so slow, the ants aren't even gone yet.
[51:07.87]And we're getting a little destroyed.
[51:08.95]Get out of there!
[51:12.58]Just drop another fucking giant monster.
[51:18.92]Oh no!
[51:19.76]Brothers!
[51:21.86]Get me into the air!
[51:26.47]Oh, there's a big Crunch Berry over here.
[51:33.36]Oh, fuck!
[51:36.14]Nope.
[51:37.42]I ran out of juice.
[51:38.56]That's it.
[51:39.14]I'm dead.
[51:42.63]Bye!
[51:42.95]Oh, you've got the Sarcanum.
[51:56.40]Oh, I bounced.
[52:01.60]What the?
[52:02.12]I can't move.
[52:02.67]Oh, let me move.
[52:03.43]I don't think you have enough health.
[52:10.45]Oh, you do have enough health.
[52:11.43]How the fuck did you manage that?
[52:12.99]How did you manage that?
[52:24.36]Oh please, what the fuck?
[52:26.84]What even just happened?
[52:28.28]You should just kill things.
[52:30.38]I honestly don't even know what the fuck just happened.
[52:32.70]I went from full health to zero.
[52:36.12]I was like landing to get you and I instantly died.
[52:45.77]That's the fastest I've ever died in this game.
[52:49.45]Coming for you guys.
[52:51.11]Game sucks.
[52:53.14]I think I just got hit with like all those bullets at the same time.
[53:18.84]Jesus.
[53:20.58]They're gonna want to leave where you just res me.
[53:26.10]For the greater good.
[53:31.21]Oh, this fucking bug.
[53:32.11]Get out of here!
[53:32.71]Ah, I'm out of juice.
[53:35.33]Oh, that artillery took so long.
[53:36.55]I was just gonna stay alive under it.
[53:39.93]Get up!
[53:45.28]Did it even come?
[54:00.77]Alright, there's so many of these fucking things.
[54:01.85]This is what I meant by permanent dead before, by the way.
[54:06.79]You can't rez an air raider in a situation like this.
[54:11.33]Stop.
[54:13.55]Stop.
[54:14.10]Stop getting me.
[54:15.12]I'm getting health.
[54:15.96]Just kill things.
[54:16.92]Don't even worry about me.
[54:18.78]Nah, I'm in trouble.
[54:21.38]Alright, I'm in trouble.
[54:22.16]Out of juice.
[54:22.82]And all I got is one shot of this, I'm gonna die here.
[54:26.08]No.
[54:26.86]I'm dead.
[54:31.65]It's up to you, Arcanum.
[54:33.45]And there's even more of these things spawning?
[54:45.89]Okay, you get the health?
[54:47.87]My butt hurts.
[54:48.83]Oh, you got the health!
[54:54.21]Oh my god, we live another day.
[55:00.31]The cycle continues.
[55:04.01]Oh shit, there's one of these guys.
[55:06.05]Why are these people spawning?
[55:08.35]Why?
[55:08.81]Because we're taking so long.
[55:17.37]This mission is so fucking long and it's so many people.
[55:24.10]Okay, so we know what you're going to do now.
[55:27.08]You're going to summon that thing.
[55:28.78]We're going to use that robot.
[55:31.30]I'm going to go off on my own.
[55:33.08]I don't trust you anymore.
[55:34.94]What?
[55:35.68]No, we can do it.
[55:36.64]We just have to plan around it.
[55:38.89]I'm sure everyone's reading chat instead of shooting things.
[55:41.61]What are you talking about?
[55:44.81]Alright, no, let's seriously do this.
[55:46.47]We can do this, fellas.
[55:48.71]Is that the, uh, the mechster?
[55:51.05]If you die, Star, you're gonna die over and over again.
[55:55.27]Yeah.
[55:55.77]Okay.
[55:56.39]So, we need to find- we need to, like, keep you in a fucking tank and never come out.
[56:05.60]Well, that's what I was doing before, but then I had to come out to resurrect you.
[56:10.86]I never got to use my tank past a certain point.
[56:13.14]We should just stay together and not, like, get lost.
[56:16.88]We're doing this thing where we, like, split up.
[56:19.32]Me and you go off and he does his own thing.
[56:22.92]We just all stay as one collective unit.
[56:26.12]Yeah.
[56:26.26]That's what we should do.
[56:28.04]And I really think you should use the big robot.
[56:30.80]We just have to use it, I guess, better.
[56:35.36]That's where I can use, really.
[56:38.04]I don't believe you.
[56:39.26]Okay, well, what mech are you choosing, though?
[56:44.03]The regular mech.
[56:46.24]Oh, the blue one?
[56:47.38]It'll be able to shoot the thingies out of the air, too, because it has anti-air.
[56:50.22]Hey, thank you, Wolf, for 10 months.
[56:51.36]Well, I'm going to switch off this terrible Gatling gun, which didn't do exactly... Thank you, Catman1900 for the sub.
[56:57.35]MrPeanut651, thanks for three months.
[57:03.75]Um... Oh, shit.
[57:06.93]I'm just going to need somebody to destroy the... the shields.
[57:15.48]I can't do it anymore.
[57:17.56]We're on hard.
[57:18.88]And I think we're at that stage of the game where we're probably not supposed to be here.
[57:25.88]Because I am getting hit like once or twice and dying.
[57:30.25]Let's see.
[57:32.39]So we just have to try not to get hit.
[57:34.01]But once they bring in those aerial units, it's like... So you picked a class with less armor and less mobility.
[57:40.91]Because that's the class I've been playing.
[57:43.78]Is it, though?
[57:44.96]Wing diver?
[57:46.34]No, I'm just on Ranger right now.
[57:48.82]I was looking at something.
[57:53.75]You guys think I should go with the... Well, no.
[57:56.85]When the aerial guys get there, I don't... I think I'm going to need to stick with the Lancer in order to go and pick up items and also be mobile enough to recover.
[58:05.39]If I go with Heavy Mortar, I can lay down enough fire on...
[58:13.79]Big guys, I think.
[58:15.25]And also on the ants.
[58:16.11]I don't know, what do you guys think?
[58:18.37]Should I go Mortar?
[58:19.15]Should I get Gatling Guns?
[58:20.43]Get an online guide.
[58:23.35]No, I think we're fine.
[58:24.57]If you could just dash in the back and get the thingies, that's going to be the most important.
[58:29.69]Okay.
[58:35.83]In that case... Have we beat any levels on Inferno?
[58:38.05]Yeah, we beat the first few on Inferno.
[58:40.16]You know what?
[58:40.70]I know what I'm going to do.
[58:41.68]I think we're still a little underleveled for this.
[58:45.84]Because things aren't dying fast enough and we're just getting like one or two shots, especially me in Arcata.
[58:51.60]I'm going to go with the... I'm not going to choose the terrible one.
[58:55.38]339 armor here is just... I get touched and I instantly die.
[59:00.07]But I think we'll still do it.
[59:03.27]Yeah, that'll work.
[59:04.99]Alright, let's do it.
[59:07.83]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[59:10.33]I'm actually going to put on this.
[59:22.46]I just wish I had more stuff.
[59:24.04]I don't have very much.
[59:26.46]You don't have one at this level?
[59:27.24]I'm just going to use, uh... They're calling it Spritefall!
[59:43.27]Yeah, it's like a completely flat level and I'm wing diver.
[59:46.16]It's like I'm asking to die.
[59:47.26]I don't think I can really reach that well.
[60:06.95]Alright, so are we sticking together?
[60:08.59]Yep.
[60:10.75]There's Colin and his mech, so let's just wait.
[60:12.89]Let's just wait.
[60:13.41]I don't think we've got to be in a rush to fight them.
[60:15.85]They are to lure them in the beginning and everything, too.
[60:35.46]If I could use my Geist, all my weapons are like 20 or...
[60:40.15]The ones that I want to use are like 20, which would be terrible here.
[60:52.92]Well, he's flying.
[60:55.52]He's still going.
[60:57.70]Yay.
[61:14.93]I have to achieve something.
[61:15.91]Give a girl back home.
[61:18.05]That's what you're fighting for.
[61:21.05]Imagine Winged... Dude, if I could use my Geist, that's like the weapon I want to use.
[61:25.97]Geist 3 is insane.
[61:28.19]Oh, so it's not hardest.
[61:31.45]Yeah.
[61:32.61]That's not a good idea.
[61:37.10]You know what happened?
[61:38.42]We were playing a bunch of on hard.
[61:40.39]We were playing on hardest a lot.
[61:42.39]To get weapons.
[61:44.03]We didn't play on hard.
[61:44.79]We can't use any of them.
[61:45.39]And I can't use any of them.
[61:46.19]All I have are like level fucking 15 and 20 items right now.
[61:59.54]Oh jeez.
[62:00.22]Where's big guy?
[62:02.54]Big boy incoming?
[62:04.56]What big boy?
[62:07.53]Are you doing big boy?
[62:09.53]No, I don't have big boy.
[62:11.19]Oh, okay.
[62:18.52]No big boys.
[62:23.74]Just average boy.
[62:32.32]I would be using the dentist gun, but it's level 20.
[62:43.31]Oh, so much shaking.
[62:45.26]Can you turn off the screen shake?
[62:48.94]I don't think so.
[62:50.40]That's fine.
[62:50.86]I don't want to anyway.
[62:52.42]We're doing pretty good so far.
[63:10.39]Let's keep it up.
[63:12.63]Not bad, pretty good.
[63:20.37]Goddamn Hector.
[63:21.19]I mean, you could maybe go Ranger.
[63:24.91]Cause I could just give you mechs to use.
[63:27.81]Yeah, I wing dire.
[63:29.16]It's just too flat.
[63:30.00]The whole, this is like final destination.
[63:33.92]I'm so bad here.
[63:35.60]I can't really, all I can do is just try not to get hit.
[63:41.33]I can't like really attack much This is where we get split up we can wait for them to walk forward or we can go around the back together just wait Then you might get pinned in a corner because we start in the corner of the map yeah, I
[64:12.28]Maybe we have to move forward.
[64:13.37]Walk left.
[64:14.67]Alright.
[64:16.59]Grabbing items.
[64:23.59]Trying not to take health packs.
[64:32.62]Eat shit.
[64:53.70]A lot of guys.
[64:58.48]Frogmen robots.
[65:01.53]I'm just frogging around.
[65:08.63]God, there's too many.
[65:09.43]I can't even think to go in here right now.
[65:15.90]Yeah, if we do this again, I'm going to play Ranger.
[65:18.12]This seems like the most intelligent thing to be doing.
[65:27.55]Shit I missed because the thing doesn't aim right This thing has got to be like one hit Gonna go frog hopping Tell me to stick together
[65:57.11]Where are you off to, man?
[65:58.65]Stay with the team.
[66:02.81]Where are you frog hopping to?
[66:03.83]Frog hopping to destroy this thing.
[66:06.25]It's out in the middle of nowhere.
[66:09.55]Would you like to?
[66:10.23]Let's get him, Jerma.
[66:14.11]We have lots of enemies.
[66:19.55]I'll get that one in the middle.
[66:25.62]Goddamn frog hopper.
[66:27.24]Carving a path.
[66:29.62]Yeah, I liked my tank for this a lot better, but then it got to phase where things are in sky.
[66:34.74]Alright, and that's coming up pretty soon.
[66:36.94]A lot, a lot of better.
[66:53.77]Alright.
[66:57.54]When do we get to see the ants?
[67:03.15]Probably soon.
[67:06.29]Probably.
[67:06.79]Probably soon.
[67:09.94]Any moment.
[67:10.42]I got a lot of boys chasing me.
[67:15.80]Ow.
[67:16.04]You actually hit me in the air?
[67:17.00]Come on.
[67:20.95]Gotcha, Baxter.
[67:29.10]I'm gonna have to kill that one last shield guy.
[67:34.18]You want me to dart for it?
[67:35.15]I can maybe get him.
[67:36.23]We don't have any... Nothing has spawned on us, by the way.
[67:40.83]I'm gonna go for the shield guy.
[67:42.95]I wonder if killing the last shield guy actually spawns the next wave of enemies.
[67:46.93]You think so?
[67:47.95]Well, we're gonna have to kill it to kill the things that are in there.
[67:51.62]You know what I mean, though?
[67:52.94]I feel like when we respawned by ants... Last time, we didn't kill anything and the ants still spawned.
[68:01.44]Really?
[68:02.88]Actually, was it at the final shield boy that we killed?
[68:06.66]I don't know.
[68:07.42]I feel like they should be spawning on us right now.
[68:13.74]Well, I'm going to go for the shield guy, but there's... Can you guys get those guys with attention?
[68:17.34]I can dart in there and kill them.
[68:19.86]I just... I can't.
[68:20.66]The wing diver is so bad here.
[68:23.30]I can't even... I got to play something else if we do this again, for sure.
[68:25.96]I just have nowhere to go.
[68:29.68]I'm just going to go everywhere.
[68:31.16]Yeah, I'm just going to have to Gatling gun them down one at a time.
[68:42.64]Come on.
[68:43.30]Request support from the armor division.
[68:54.19]There we go.
[68:54.47]They're coming.
[69:07.51]I try to like go in and do anything.
[69:11.68]Insta-dead.
[69:14.52]Alright, I'm gonna come get you.
[69:22.14]Now I'm gonna be permanent dead.
[69:24.64]It takes too long to do that last thing.
[69:27.28]I can't even look at the ants.
[69:35.21]I'm definitely Clan Ranger this next one.
[69:37.55]This class is terrible here.
[69:42.84]Bye.
[69:45.22]And now I'll never be red.
[69:48.32]I got sent to the other side of the map.
[69:51.62]Hold on, I'm coming for you.
[69:56.13]Here comes the ant invasion.
[70:21.02]I'll have the health.
[70:24.37]Run.
[70:25.19]Run away.
[70:25.65]I'm gonna go get some health.
[70:28.11]I'll be back for you.
[70:45.49]Alright, I'm coming for you.
[70:47.79]And then we can go get Sterk.
[70:50.97]I have faith.
[71:02.41]Alright, stay with me.
[71:03.49]Let's kill the ants and let's make our way to Sterk.
[71:07.71]Mm-hmm.
[71:08.11]Alright, I'm going to set up my Gatling guns.
[71:13.63]Just keep them from charging me.
[71:20.32]Come here, you ant.
[71:21.12]Alright, let's go get him.
[71:23.76]Are you ready for this?
[71:24.69]You ready to try it?
[71:25.55]Oh, this is what I'm talking about.
[71:26.99]Oh, God.
[71:37.84]We're coming for you.
[71:48.96]Flat ground.
[71:49.72]I'm going to grab some health.
[71:54.36]Alright.
[71:56.00]Charging coming for you.
[71:57.46]Watch out, you've got one right next to you.
[71:58.82]Alright, let's do this.
[72:21.83]Oh, he's looking at me.
[72:24.43]There are hundreds.
[72:25.61]Alright, I'm going to go grab some health.
[72:29.67]I'll be back in it.
[72:35.21]Get away from me.
[72:37.64]Oh, what?
[72:40.96]I'm fucked.
[72:41.94]I'm dead.
[72:42.62]They're not looking at me.
[72:44.18]Why are they not looking at me?
[72:45.26]No, they are.
[72:45.82]I'm dead.
[72:47.62]No, I'm not quite dead, but I will be.
[72:52.36]I somehow made it out.
[72:57.03]I'm coming to you, Star.
[73:06.03]No, fucking here comes... All that work, and here come all the fucking flying enemies now.
[73:18.33]Oh, six health!
[73:25.41]Dear God.
[73:26.61]And I don't have enough juice to fly.
[73:30.13]There's a fucking ant right here.
[73:36.01]Oh, God.
[73:37.93]This is fucking insane.
[73:43.03]All that work and all that time.
[73:49.48]Oh, yeah, you can't use Spark Fall anymore.
[73:51.38]To get spawned on by a hundred drones.
[73:59.02]What keeps slowing me?
[74:00.12]I don't know what's slowing me.
[74:11.19]I missed it.
[74:11.91]I missed the health.
[74:14.29]I missed the health.
[74:14.91]I think we're on opposite ends of the map again.
[74:26.43]Mission failed.
[74:28.46]Damn it.
[74:29.24]I want to beat this.
[74:30.94]I'm going to play it, Ranger.
[74:35.14]No more wing diver here.
[74:36.25]It's just flat.
[74:37.29]Can't do anything.
[74:43.11]I feel really good about my weapon choices.
[74:44.75]Fine.
[74:47.09]I wish I had anything that was over level.
[74:51.24]Fucking 20!
[75:00.36]Uh, should I get the... You want me to do the tank heal thing?
[75:04.28]No, I want to call it on a tank and have you use it.
[75:06.81]Okay.
[75:07.49]It doesn't even matter what weapons you use, so sure, tank heal, I guess.
[75:11.91]Let me see here.
[75:18.47]Go back to level two.
[75:22.44]You guys think I should change what I'm doing?
[75:24.24]I feel it was pretty solid.
[75:25.78]I can get health, and I'm able to get you guys back up.
[75:29.37]Yeah Let's see how this thing works Just like a spray, okay cool.
[75:39.58]Hey Jerma wait for the tank.
[75:41.02]I know I'm just moving around shooting
[76:00.03]That one's coming straight for us.
[76:02.28]Yeah, it is.
[76:03.02]Yep.
[76:03.36]I'm gonna ride with you.
[76:16.48]Don't go carelessly.
[76:24.49]Even less distance than my own Gatling guns.
[76:30.61]Should we be focusing together on one?
[76:32.95]Nope.
[76:33.71]We should start on one side of the wave and move to the right, I think.
[76:37.03]Or right or left, we just have to focus on one.
[76:40.11]Makes sense.
[76:41.97]You wanted to shoot left?
[76:43.23]Yeah, I'm going to start with left.
[76:46.22]Well, I mean, I can't do anything yet until they get closer.
[76:54.66]Right's or is the legs?
[76:59.49]Oh, my God, please.
[77:06.04]Oh, please move, tank.
[77:13.61]It's easier to turn the tank with A and D to turn, drive left and right to aim it.
[77:17.93]Oh, really?
[77:19.17]Than just to drag your mouse.
[77:20.13]Holy shit.
[77:20.67]Because it turns really fast.
[77:22.49]Well, yeah, that's a good tip.
[77:24.39]You guys are doing pretty good.
[77:51.86]Really?
[77:52.12]How did that not hit him?
[77:52.76]What?
[77:54.96]What?
[77:55.84]Why are these not hitting him?
[77:58.79]Okay.
[78:00.13]I think it's a game suck situation.
[78:01.79]Well, he was like dancing at the exact right second for him to not get hit by it.
[78:06.11]I'm out of ammo with this thing.
[78:07.88]I have a couple of them called down over here.
[78:19.07]They're like all dead, so I think this was a success.
[78:28.74]It only takes two shots with this cannon to destroy the shields.
[78:32.92]So are we just driving straight up there, or what do you want to do?
[78:39.52]Ah, shit.
[78:42.97]Ah, shit.
[78:43.41]Where are we going, left side or right side?
[78:52.71]Left side.
[78:56.90]I'm gonna go grab items.
[79:02.51]We should just all be rangers.
[79:05.69]Seriously.
[79:06.79]It's just, this is going way more smoothly than it was before.
[79:10.80]Playing as my class?
[79:12.48]Playing as tank man.
[79:23.35]Wow.
[79:23.85]That just got in the way.
[79:26.23]What?
[79:26.97]The tank just dropped.
[79:30.75]Did you just explode?
[79:33.75]I think it destroyed that tank because I called a new tank in and there were too many tanks already out so it blew that one up.
[79:45.16]Should we just go straight in here?
[79:46.86]Just go in the bubble?
[79:49.57]Screw it.
[79:58.83]Oh shit, come on.
[80:00.15]Step forward.
[80:05.63]We're doing pretty good.
[80:06.45]Give it up fellas.
[80:13.80]How much ammo do you have Jerma?
[80:14.82]Twelve.
[80:17.32]I'm gonna go get the other shield generators.
[80:22.23]Twelve.
[80:31.05]I'll go use my remaining shots on these dudes.
[80:41.55]Ah, good thing I didn't shoot.
[80:42.33]Oh, that's alright.
[80:46.88]Don't go near those guys' artillery.
[81:01.50]I hope your tank doesn't randomly explode because I called in another one.
[81:04.54]Uh, hope it doesn't either.
[81:06.48]I'm out of bullets here.
[81:10.43]I am out.
[81:12.77]Ants are coming.
[81:20.49]Oh, Jesus.
[81:22.51]Oh, God.
[81:22.99]Yeah, they blew up because you called another one in.
[81:24.65]Oh, shit.
[81:27.55]Oh, boy.
[81:29.15]Okay.
[81:30.05]Oh, fuck.
[81:33.12]Well, do you have the ooze gun?
[81:35.22]I do have the ooze gun.
[81:36.74]But you called it and it just instantly exploded.
[81:39.24]And it's gone.
[81:39.62]Oh god.
[81:40.84]Just keep going.
[81:51.57]No, hold on.
[81:57.17]Is that doing anything?
[81:58.31]Yep, that's healing me.
[82:01.28]Alright, coming in.
[82:02.38]Watch out behind you, Jerma.
[82:04.59]I'll cover you.
[82:06.21]Slow down for a second.
[82:07.87]I threw an artillery in there.
[82:08.87]Alright.
[82:13.91]Oh, God.
[82:16.99]Oh, God.
[82:17.29]We might get... Oh, God.
[82:21.74]Wait, wait, wait.
[82:22.36]Stop, stop, stop.
[82:29.58]Come on.
[82:29.82]Just like Battlefield.
[82:30.58]Repair.
[82:34.28]Okay, I have to call in another tank.
[82:36.90]Nobody get in this one?
[82:39.10]That one's almost done with.
[82:40.48]Okay, well, whatever.
[82:42.05]Who's gonna use the gun?
[82:42.73]Alright, we're in a way better position right now.
[82:50.01]Into the air!
[82:56.34]I'm gonna wait till they get closer.
[82:57.42]Oh boy, you're dropping that over here.
[83:03.54]Got a couple.
[83:04.12]Alright, guys.
[83:05.47]I'm going to go gather up some items, okay?
[83:07.41]Yep.
[83:08.91]I'm in the gunner's seat.
[83:16.99]Oh, this thing just sucks, huh?
[83:20.71]Yeah.
[83:21.01]It's like barely hurting these things.
[83:29.99]How's your head?
[83:31.33]Wow, this thing sucks real bad!
[83:33.65]It can't even kill these fucking stupid mosquitoes!
[83:38.89]I'm almost out of ammo, too.
[83:42.40]Wow, alright, well, hold on.
[83:43.48]Have you destroyed anything?
[83:45.26]I killed one, and I had to unload on it for like a full, like, three seconds.
[83:48.46]Alright, I'm gonna repair.
[83:49.84]Ready?
[83:50.84]Wait, wait, wait.
[83:56.43]You made me stop driving!
[84:01.11]Well, look at, like, fucking surrounded.
[84:02.71]You think you're gonna get anything off there?
[84:09.21]Fucking Jesus.
[84:12.67]I don't think I can call tanks in anymore at this point.
[84:15.52]Is it just, like, hidden around the area?
[84:17.38]Oh, God, I... I just, like, wave-dashed into you.
[84:21.28]I'm coming for you.
[84:22.02]I'm coming for you.
[84:23.38]Are you good?
[84:23.76]Alright, you guys good?
[84:28.88]Jesus Christ.
[84:40.27]This is too many.
[84:43.79]I hope you got in a tank or something.
[84:44.91]Two for one.
[84:45.81]I got a tank.
[84:47.07]Where are you?
[84:47.51]Come to me.
[84:48.77]I'm dead.
[84:50.82]Coming for you.
[84:51.32]Don't worry.
[85:00.28]I'm on the way, Jerma.
[85:01.36]Well, if you can get me, I can heal his tank.
[85:06.20]Holy shit.
[85:07.36]Oh, you both are gonna get hurt at the exact same time.
[85:09.04]Oh my god.
[85:12.66]Oh no, I'm still dead.
[85:13.70]I'm still dead.
[85:14.34]Here we go.
[85:16.08]I had to abandon the tank so you could repair it while I'm not in it so I'm not shooting it.
[85:22.88]Is that working?
[85:26.16]Yeah.
[85:27.88]It gained a bit.
[85:28.76]We need to move away from the artillery guys and kind of focus down the rest of these...
[85:39.05]Jeez, man.
[85:39.71]Fucking Cheetos, man.
[85:42.39]Oh, I'm dying.
[85:47.54]Drive back to me.
[85:55.40]Oh, that's all I can do for you.
[85:56.60]I'm going to die here in a second.
[86:00.93]Ah, shit.
[86:07.30]My god, there's another swarm of ants God why this may just be a mission to where it's like, I wish we had another person Oh, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[86:18.25]Let me just do this for a second Why I don't even oh there's your body Oh
[86:33.89]Dude, look what these guys spawned.
[86:35.85]They spawned right on top of us.
[86:39.05]No.
[86:43.45]Look at the ants, too.
[86:45.19]You gotta be shitting me.
[86:47.21]I'm gonna go grab this health back over here, and then I'm gonna work my way to you guys.
[86:56.86]Wait, I can actually heal people with this gun, too?
[86:58.74]I think so.
[87:04.98]Oh, hey fellas, you guys look kinda mad about something.
[87:07.95]Oh, don't mind me, I'm just... I'm just gonna go heal my friends.
[87:15.69]I mean, this- we actually might be in an okay spot.
[87:20.75]If you can get a couple of res's here, Arcadum, which is gonna be extremely difficult, cause look at all the things fucking unloading on you at the same time.
[87:26.44]Yeah, bolt.
[87:27.28]There's- there's explosions.
[87:30.10]There's- I don't think you have enough health to res anymore.
[87:33.40]No.
[87:35.43]I almost made it.
[87:37.59]Well.
[87:39.92]I don't have the mission after this.
[87:41.28]I have a mission a couple ones after this.
[87:43.50]Just do it on normal.
[87:44.34]This is obviously, like, we're just not geared enough to do it.
[87:50.52]Just do it on normal.
[87:51.32]We, like, obviously can't stay alive long.
[87:54.60]Things are spawning too fast on us for us to even try to attempt to kill them.
[88:03.70]Thanks, Never Trust Purple for the 10 bucks.
[88:05.04]I tried, guys.
[88:05.46]I'm sorry.
[88:06.64]No, no, that's not it.
[88:07.76]It's just hard is hard, especially when you haven't completed the game on normal.
[88:13.97]It's just not possible.
[88:17.99]We all have way too low armor, except for maybe you, Star, but you've played a lot longer, haven't you?
[88:22.90]Yeah.
[88:25.56]The same exact thing happened to us when we played on level 11.
[88:30.00]We got like an extra 100 armor and the mission was easy.
[88:36.04]This is like one of those situations where it's maybe like a 22% completion for us to beat this.
[88:40.10]I think it was, yeah, Ster sucks.
[88:42.44]I think it was his fault.
[88:44.72]I think it might have been your fault, yeah.
[88:48.88]But hold on, give me a second.
[88:49.98]Well, I don't have... Yeah, I don't have anything.
[89:01.97]Anybody have any weapons?
[89:04.53]What's the weapon limit?
[89:06.65]Like, 10 or 9.
[89:07.59]Oh, well, whatever.
[89:08.73]We're fine then.
[89:09.38]We all have, like, zero weapons.
[89:22.06]I don't have a... I think... I don't think I have a single vehicle.
[89:25.32]Which is the problem.
[89:29.17]Let's see what vehicles I have.
[89:30.93]Okay, I have, like, a couple of things here.
[89:33.95]I have the bike.
[89:36.13]Oh, you got the bike?
[89:37.27]Nice.
[89:42.22]Mirage 5-way.
[89:43.36]If only we had some oil barrels.
[89:49.84]What's the maximum you can have?
[89:51.12]Up to 9?
[89:51.80]Okay.
[89:59.71]Sniper weapons.
[90:03.05]They want the bike.
[90:05.85]I don't have anything for Fencer.
[90:06.87]I'm going to have to be a sissy.
[90:15.87]No, like, let's be real here.
[90:18.29]Be realistic about it.
[90:20.23]There's like a maybe 20% chance we'll be there.
[90:22.81]I think we would have done it there if we had four people because that seemed to be right at the end.
[90:27.00]It was like that last final wave.
[90:28.90]If there's more after that, I'd be really surprised.
[90:31.50]We just need like an extra 200 armor each.
[90:38.72]I'm gonna just use this thing.
[90:48.12]These are like the weapons I'm gonna be using.
[90:51.29]Level 2s and shit.
[90:54.21]Okay, we'll... We'll make up for you.
[90:58.61]I got him.
[91:00.95]Too far away.
[91:15.68]See, now I think I'll be safe just to fly up there.
[91:17.76]Hmm, I wonder if I can kill these guys with the hammers.
[91:23.24]My best character has 350 armor, star is 700+.
[91:25.38]It's the class, though.
[91:27.40]The wing divers have very low armor, but very low 339 is a lot different than having like 500.
[91:39.57]Let's go get them without a controller.
[91:42.11]So let's struggle to go get them.
[91:46.51]The air raid is coming.
[91:49.65]We just need the hand of God or whatever.
[91:53.88]We need some... Heaven's Gate.
[91:56.26]Yeah.
[92:04.82]Chopper gunner for the M64.
[92:05.96]You know what I'm talking about?
[92:17.07]I'm surprised this is still too far away.
[92:21.09]Oh wow, that's really not within range.
[92:26.32]Yeah, I'm just flying in doing some chopper gunner.
[92:28.54]Okay, why was this thing not hitting him?
[92:31.86]Alright, I was doing an experiment there and I died.
[92:34.32]Oh yeah, okay.
[92:36.89]This weapon was not hitting him.
[92:38.51]I could not hit him with the weapon.
[92:40.59]It's supposed to be a sniper rifle.
[92:46.95]Holy shit, that still has no damage.
[92:49.53]Is that the problem?
[92:50.28]We just can't... what?
[92:57.02]Why couldn't I... I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you.
[93:04.05]Oh god, I can't... I can't dash, really.
[93:09.92]I'm gonna have to just kill him the old-fashioned way before I can get to you.
[93:13.72]Can't beat normal.
[93:14.76]Dude, these weapons suck.
[93:15.48]We don't have normal weapons.
[93:19.02]We don't, we, okay, we have to play the game on normal to get normal weapons.
[93:23.55]Wait, what?
[93:23.91]That's like, what the fuck?
[93:27.17]I'm coming to you.
[93:28.09]Don't worry, Jerma.
[93:34.62]Holy shit, these are terrible.
[93:39.86]Geez, maybe we were better off on hard.
[93:41.27]The way this is looking, probably.
[93:53.76]Can we kill anything?
[93:55.00]I've been killing stuff.
[94:05.29]I'm calling airstrikes on them and they're living.
[94:07.95]It only took like 10 shots with my plasma launcher to kill one of those things.
[94:14.64]Good thing I have this seizure gun.
[94:30.32]Calling an air raid?
[94:34.96]Gonna cause temporary blindness.
[94:41.47]My vehicle has less armor than I do now.
[94:43.15]These things are so annoying to fly.
[95:01.94]On, uh, keyboard.
[95:15.95]We're running into the same situation we ran into a week ago.
[95:24.50]You have to play the game for like 12 hours on a lower difficulty before you can do the actual missions that you're supposed to be geared for at th-
[95:33.62]But maybe those are the actual missions we're supposed to be geared for.
[95:36.92]Uh, I don't think so.
[95:38.90]I have 300 armor.
[95:48.26]I mean, maybe the normal missions are the actual missions I'm sending.
[95:52.11]Uh, probably.
[96:09.61]Oh, come on.
[96:15.43]Oh, the stupid shield.
[96:16.63]I'm gonna get some items.
[96:22.25]Why do we keep picking up items if we can't beat the mission?
[96:26.29]Well, I mean, like, just in case we beat it.
[96:30.14]This is awful.
[96:37.20]I can't hurt things.
[96:41.08]I'll go get some health, I'll be right back.
[96:43.96]Well, at least we can't, like, get THAT killed.
[96:47.64]It's not, like, instantly dying.
[96:50.82]I'm gonna come over to you.
[96:55.92]Oh, did my stream start freaking out again?
[96:57.76]Are people saying your stream is being a weird drama?
[96:59.66]Uhh, I don't think so.
[97:01.30]Twitch has done some odd shit to me today.
[97:06.80]When I started my stream, it was some weird shit.
[97:09.90]Not since starting though.
[97:18.39]Seriously.
[97:18.87]This is fucking so stupid.
[97:30.12]This fucking die!
[97:34.14]It's taking so long to kill anything!
[97:59.94]Please Use a rapier, I don't think I have a rapier
[98:08.59]At level zero.
[98:10.37]Can you get a level zero rapier?
[98:12.15]Will a level zero rapier be better than a level two?
[98:14.78]I don't think so.
[98:16.56]Maybe.
[98:27.77]Ooh, look at those ants.
[98:28.83]I'mma go get some ass.
[98:38.32]Oh, my fucking god, give me a break.
[98:44.72]Oh, please.
[98:45.22]I feel like I'm the least well-equipped to go after these shields.
[98:52.32]And I've destroyed them.
[98:54.22]I hate shooting up in the air as this class.
[98:56.10]I don't know why I'm still playing it.
[98:57.58]Alright, going for the shield.
[99:02.09]Over here.
[99:07.58]The journey of a thousand miles down to the one step.
[99:14.94]That's true.
[99:15.99]That is true.
[99:26.79]Ow.
[99:29.64]Well, I might as well turn my stream off.
[99:31.86]It's going to be doing that again.
[99:33.38]What is it doing?
[99:35.19]Apparently, it just gets really pixelated to the point you can't even see what's happening.
[99:39.37]That's not cool.
[99:52.74]Nice.
[99:58.94]Oh, please.
[99:59.70]Are you going to put that on right now?
[100:01.10]Come on.
[100:03.24]At this rate, we're going to all be killed.
[100:07.79]Probably.
[100:09.49]Probably.
[100:10.05]I'm just trying to get out so I can... Jesus.
[100:25.70]People in my chat are saying it's not just you.
[100:28.68]Yeah, I know.
[100:29.68]It was happening to people earlier today.
[100:31.02]It doesn't look like it's happening to me.
[100:50.35]I don't go for this shield guy.
[100:53.05]Please!
[100:54.21]He's been alive for far too long.
[100:56.55]I know.
[100:59.22]Block this, you nerd.
[101:01.60]Well, all the drones are almost dead.
[101:04.36]If you'd like a plus.
[101:05.68]Alright, he's down.
[101:14.11]Don't you do it.
[101:14.99]Don't you shoot it.
[101:24.17]There's one more of these little shits.
[101:31.28]Don't blow me up.
[101:33.50]He's dead.
[101:34.96]Okay.
[101:36.10]We're gonna beat it.
[101:37.28]We're gonna complete it.
[101:44.38]I thought you were going to keep walking, man.
[101:48.24]The seizure gun!
[101:51.18]I'm in a little bit of danger.
[101:53.46]You are?
[101:53.78]Where are you?
[101:58.17]You seem like you're in a little bit of danger.
[101:59.55]There's a huge health pack right next to you.
[102:06.71]Who needs that?
[102:18.26]Alright, uh, you wanna bet like 500 million dollars that the next mission on Hard is just regular, like a normal mission?
[102:24.13]It probably is.
[102:29.11]I'm flying in.
[102:29.73]Uh, where- are these ants coming from over here?
[102:32.57]Yeah, here they come, the ants.
[102:36.22]Buh buh buh!
[102:49.36]Use my other gun.
[102:50.42]My other gun is a piece of dog shit.
[102:54.68]I just threw it on because it was one of the only things that was usable above zero.
[102:58.58]Alright, so we got those drones over there.
[103:05.26]Not drones, but ants.
[103:06.22]Yep.
[103:07.34]I'm going to take care of them.
[103:11.21]Aww.
[103:11.93]Hey, Jerma, at this point, maybe you should pick up some armor.
[103:17.35]That's probably a good idea.
[103:19.97]I think you guys can handle it.
[103:23.48]I think we're gravy.
[103:26.48]Millionaire wheelbarrow streamer.
[103:29.12]Oh, is it the chopper?
[103:31.74]Like, is it a normal stream problem?
[103:33.34]Like, oh, the spinning blades of the chopper.
[103:35.74]The bitrate's too high.
[103:44.24]Where am I throwing these helicopters?
[103:48.17]You're still in the part of the mission where I just can't call shit?
[104:04.76]Here comes the armor collector, that's right, that's me.
[104:08.66]Well, never mind.
[104:11.18]Hey look, we beat the mission guys.
[104:13.33]We did it.
[104:14.03]It only took us two hours.
[104:19.53]Oh wow, some level 7 items?
[104:21.91]Oh god.
[104:22.93]What the hell is a vibro roller?
[104:25.15]But we got 37 armor.
[104:26.77]I use one of those.
[104:27.63]I use one of those every night.
[104:29.87]Oh my.
[104:33.17]Where's my V?
[104:36.55]Oh, we're going in a nest.
[104:46.70]Guys, we're going in a nest.
[104:49.69]Are we going hard again?
[104:50.59]Hey, we beat, we beat, yeah.
[104:52.05]Because this, this is gonna be like a normal fucking regular ass mission.
[104:55.63]Okay, so we're doing... Angers me more than anything.
[105:00.18]We're going in the nest, guys.
[105:03.28]Guys, you ready for a nest?
[105:04.60]Remember that last mission you did on the same difficulty?
[105:07.04]Remember it was like fucking impossible?
[105:09.14]Get over yourself!
[105:10.36]The next one's normal.
[105:11.10]So if we're going in a nest...

[106:04.54]Okay.
[106:06.68]Are we ready?
[106:07.92]Hold on, I'm still thinking about
[106:11.22]Line driver.
[106:14.59]I do have the mirror laser.
[106:15.87]I'm using it right now.
[106:20.31]What's for dinner?
[106:32.71]It's either that or I go rock'em, sock'em robots.
[106:34.93]Why am I a doofus?
[106:35.61]What'd I do?
[106:38.36]Tells me that.
[106:38.98]You know what?
[106:42.82]I'm gonna go with the Hakans.
[106:46.60]Okay.
[106:53.86]Oh, yeah.
[106:55.26]Alright, let's do some reflection.
[107:04.19]I'm a spider.
[107:05.91]Okay, yeah, the Hakans are not the Hakans I thought they were.
[107:08.77]Oop.
[107:12.67]I'm crawling, I'm sailing.
[107:15.61]Never mind, that gives me a headache.
[107:20.98]Oh yeah, we're doing the Drano mission.
[107:22.32]Yeah, we're doing Drano mission again.
[107:23.72]I don't want to use the mirror laser down here.
[107:31.83]I feel like I could accidentally kill somebody.
[107:47.67]You think you need butter, Ashley?
[107:49.85]Uh... Makes sense, depends how good your cheese is.
[107:56.52]We got some buttery cheese.
[108:02.18]Oh.
[108:04.12]Somebody shot me in the back.
[108:05.84]Oh, I thought this gun was different.
[108:09.48]You watch out, Star.
[108:11.24]It's, uh, dangerous.
[108:30.91]Grandma, stand still.
[108:33.99]What was that?
[108:35.19]That heals you forever.
[108:37.21]Heals me forever?
[108:37.99]Well, there's a lot of stuff that's down here.
[108:48.55]I'm coming!
[108:49.23]Shut up!
[108:49.69]We're trying to push through the, uh... There's like two more ants.
[109:01.55]I'm out of the drain.
[109:04.59]Okay, armors?
[109:05.45]We get the armor?
[109:06.71]Thank you.
[109:08.03]Oh my goodness.
[109:08.61]I'm just trying to heal people and you keep walking and it doesn't reload?
[109:18.33]like a big health kit right there do I only get five shots per level I don't know apparently oh wait that's a really good gun I guess down this tube we gotta go this way do we uh yeah be sure uh alright can we break through this uh I don't think so well it's an invisible wall up ahead
[109:43.14]Down here?
[109:44.60]No, the same thing.
[109:47.48]You're telling me this game sucks?
[109:49.14]No.
[109:50.52]Wait, can we keep going?
[109:52.66]I would assume we have to be able to.
[109:54.08]Oh, wow.
[109:54.96]Well, look at the red line.
[109:56.04]Yeah, it's weird.
[109:58.28]You see how we're walking right by it?
[109:59.61]Oh, my God.
[110:02.15]Arcade, I'm going to slap you in the mouth.
[110:06.09]Right here on streams.
[110:07.41]Right across the mouth.
[110:12.13]Man, Jerma, that is a disco gun.
[110:17.57]What the fuck am I looking at?
[110:20.17]It's just reflecting off of every wall.
[110:21.83]Alright, let me help you.
[110:25.97]There's something satisfying about the Gatling gun.
[110:29.11]I'm coming.
[110:29.99]There's just too many corpses.
[110:31.65]They're not despawned and captured.
[110:41.70]Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.
[110:43.36]Fill the tunnel with light.
[110:49.71]A pretty good disco diaper.
[110:53.65]There's too many corpses.
[110:54.53]I can't see the stuff.
[110:57.55]I am here now.
[110:59.25]Hi.
[111:05.30]Am I shooting the floor?
[111:06.38]Well, considering... Let's see what this does.
[111:10.64]It reflects off of every surface, so... Yep.
[111:14.57]I think somebody just thought I was going like, I'm gonna shoot a ground.
[111:23.45]I mean, this is Goldeneye.
[111:25.99]Oh, we got a bunch of dudes joining us.
[111:30.97]You're right.
[111:38.34]He's got so many weird loopy bits about it Diagonally and walking spider diagonal.
[111:45.87]Oh, no.
[111:46.15]Okay.
[111:46.65]He wasn't talking about me Who was shooting the floor nobody I don't think anybody was with it Maybe it was the way it looked on this from my screen.
[111:54.83]I don't know
[112:07.97]I just wish I was caught up enough to help.
[112:14.35]The slow little spider buggy you're in.
[112:21.22]This weapon is very situational but broken.
[112:23.76]Oh, it's crazy.
[112:25.28]I love it.
[112:25.94]I love it in these tunnels.
[112:26.88]It's just so dumb.
[112:28.22]Are they coming through?
[112:29.66]Where are they coming from?
[112:31.26]Are they?
[112:32.06]I think so.
[112:32.76]Yeah, they're up there.
[112:36.06]Be careful.
[112:36.34]Come get some, nerds.
[112:40.75]It's just the same map, but reversed.
[112:47.76]I'm having a seizure right now.
[112:49.10]Yeah, I don't... I'll kill us all if I pull that down.
[112:55.16]What is happening on the screen?
[112:56.52]I don't think anybody knows.
[112:58.01]Yeah!
[112:59.25]Woo!
[113:01.57]Woo!
[113:02.17]Seizure!
[113:05.09]Oh, I'm feeling worse!
[113:16.12]Ow, you shot me.
[113:16.84]Hey, thanks for picking up all the health.
[113:26.98]And your huge rocket spider.
[113:29.62]I remember there used to be a hero.
[113:34.75]That story's blown out of proportions.
[113:39.69]And... Who's down there?
[113:42.95]Whoever's down there...
[113:45.38]You're about to get reflected.
[114:00.85]Oh, the ants are like, can you cut that out?
[114:03.21]It's so bright.
[114:04.77]Come on, you nerds.
[114:12.91]How would you feel if they came into our home and started killing us?
[114:17.64]That'd be so sad.
[114:18.60]I don't think we should be here.
[114:30.29]Dangerous.
[114:33.81]Murder.
[114:41.98]Where is it?
[114:42.68]Oh shit!
[114:43.50]One last ant!
[114:46.10]The annoying flashlight guy.
[114:47.57]I'M JUMPIN' IN!
[114:50.29]Careful!
[114:50.77]Roger that.
[114:53.75]Deployed, mister.
[114:56.81]Deployed.
[115:05.88]Did it?
[115:06.36]That can't be it.
[115:06.92]Where are they?
[115:09.76]I'm so sick of walking.
[115:15.07]Which way are they coming from?
[115:16.86]Is there this tunnel down here?
[115:18.34]We shouldn't have jumped down here.
[115:19.46]You all followed me.
[115:20.54]I'm not down there.
[115:21.12]Oh, they're coming from that tunnel.
[115:23.78]Yeah, I can sense it.
[115:26.93]Oh, please.
[115:29.43]Give me blood and fury.
[115:32.71]I guess they kind of have to be, right?
[115:36.97]From where?
[115:37.49]Where am I?
[115:38.23]Where should I be going?
[115:40.53]I don't know.
[115:41.35]We'll go down.
[115:42.35]See down this little town?
[115:43.95]I'm like lighting the way.
[115:44.89]See?
[115:46.10]Can you see my light?
[115:49.26]Can you see?
[115:49.94]Oh my goodness.
[115:51.18]We're in that hole.
[115:54.88]I didn't even see the hole.
[116:01.76]Get ready for spider bomb.
[116:03.04]I'm going to fucking destroy you accidentally, Arcade.
[116:05.48]I'm not going to do that right here.
[116:11.95]Wow, what a normal mission journal, I'm just so angry
[116:37.48]Well, Kimmy, that last mission was a flat plain with like 500 enemies.
[116:48.08]You weren't ready to defend your mother Earth.
[116:49.58]There's a fork in the road.
[116:50.44]Are we going left?
[116:51.30]No, because we picked a terrible place to defend it.
[116:55.68]Everything's exu.
[116:59.02]Fight them on the farm.
[117:00.24]That's a good idea.
[117:04.64]Down here?
[117:05.07]It's not EFD.
[117:07.54]Dummy.
[117:11.97]Take half your health and damage if you say so.
[117:16.87]Where are you guys?
[117:17.63]I'll make sure we all stick together.
[117:24.88]Is this footage of my colonoscopy?
[117:26.82]That was really good.
[117:36.53]D&D stream 4?
[117:37.45]No, we quit.
[117:38.27]We're done with it.
[117:38.81]There are fucking 5 million enemies coming up here.
[117:44.51]Ognarok is dead.
[117:48.27]Whoops, I always press jump instead of right button.
[117:53.53]Oh no!
[117:57.57]Holy fuck.
[117:59.35]You're in trouble in there, dude.
[118:03.50]You're about to explode.
[118:09.57]Are you still alive?
[118:11.73]Oh, fuck!
[118:13.43]No.
[118:14.83]Yes you are.
[118:19.55]Too dark, man.
[118:20.64]It is too dark.
[118:25.30]Can we push our cannon in further?
[118:29.62]Back up if you can, I don't want this to hit you.
[118:46.75]Oh God, I thought you were a bug.
[118:49.44]You were super bug-shaped and freaked me out.
[118:54.02]I do look like a bug.
[118:56.78]Yeah, this is my colonoscopy.
[118:58.38]I have a bunch of worms and ants and shit in my colon.
[119:01.70]Arcadum laid on the ground, having failed his combat.
[119:06.34]Alright, I think it's safe.
[119:07.23]Yeah, you said EDF wrong.
[119:12.83]Alright, let's collect stuff.
[119:18.84]You certainly do for a colonoscopy if you have ants up there.
[119:23.95]Yeah.
[119:26.37]I didn't know that was the last area.
[119:29.21]I would have waited to kill it.
[119:33.41]Weapon!
[119:33.69]We got 58 armor.
[119:34.83]That's a lot for a mission.
[119:35.45]That's pretty good.
[119:35.95]Yeah, we did get a lot.
[119:36.55]Laser chainsaw, huh?
[119:48.10]Eye on mirror shield.
[119:52.15]What?
[119:52.51]Double rainbow?
[119:53.79]We still in a tunnel?
[120:03.14]Ah, the quake hacking is what it's called.
[120:04.92]Okay.
[120:16.68]Where the hell is it?
[120:23.59]Forget level two.
[120:24.81]Play that level.
[120:26.63]There it is.
[120:28.43]I'll try this new set of weapons up, sure.
[120:30.91]What are we playing?
[120:32.83]Oh, it's like a giant sword.
[120:34.99]What match?
[120:36.63]I think we're doing... It's phase two of the tunnel.
[120:39.51]Same thing, yeah, tunnel.
[120:41.15]Oh.
[120:42.81]Tunnel!
[120:45.82]Hey, I've got 703 armor!
[120:48.76]Mr. Wolfgang, thanks for the 500 bits to save our Mother Earth from any alien attack from vicious giant insects who have once again come back.
[120:54.02]Wheel!
[120:54.66]These are my new hammers, look at these.
[120:56.12]Oh, behind us!
[120:57.40]Stop showing off your hammers!
[120:59.46]I wasn't ready.
[121:00.62]I wasn't ready.
[121:01.84]You're showing us hammers.
[121:03.44]What?
[121:04.56]What are you doing?
[121:06.40]I gotta get my thing out of here quick.
[121:07.71]Oh, fuck.
[121:09.93]I'm gonna... We're all gonna die in here.
[121:11.51]I have to change weapons if we're gonna do this, because I'm gonna fucking bounce this off every wall and we're dead.
[121:17.60]Fuck it, just do it!
[121:23.63]Back to back!
[121:29.02]Okay, I just fucking killed us all.
[121:32.20]That was all my fault.
[121:33.17]Oh god.
[121:50.40]Ow.
[121:53.70]This is too close quarters.
[121:56.30]I'm in the web.
[121:57.92]You're in the web.
[122:01.47]Holy shit.
[122:05.61]I can't even see the ground.
[122:06.49]I can't switch these hammers off.
[122:07.79]They are pretty terrible.
[122:09.79]I don't understand how to use them.
[122:12.25]Like, they charge up so slow.
[122:15.44]I don't get it.
[122:20.01]I have Dying Ranger because I have no armor, but I have a feeling.
[122:24.50]You know what we're going to do here?
[122:29.00]Try the chainsaw?
[122:29.68]I'll try the chainsaw.
[122:36.49]What are we going to do here?
[122:37.43]You tell me.
[122:40.83]Alright.
[122:41.07]Anyways, what I was saying.
[122:41.99]Sorry.
[122:44.23]Mr. Wolfgang, thanks for the 500 bits.
[122:47.07]To save you.
[122:49.28]Unleash our forces.
[122:50.00]We won't cut any slack.
[122:50.88]The EDF deploys.
[122:54.48]Cool.
[122:56.70]Cool Earth Defense Force.
[122:58.98]Thanks, Wolfgang.
[122:59.62]Appreciate it, dude.
[123:02.43]And... I think I'm caught up on the subs, too.
[123:04.79]Thanks a lot, guys.
[123:06.45]Thanks, guys.
[123:08.49]Thanks for watching us kill bugs.
[123:10.83]Appreciate you sticking around.
[123:18.70]Wow.
[123:24.21]Game sucks.
[123:24.61]What are you doing?
[123:25.53]Game sucks.
[123:26.35]Game sucks.
[123:27.47]Why are you restarting?
[123:32.67]Oh, that's a... I'm going to stand to the left.
[123:34.19]What are you doing?
[123:36.02]Hold on!
[123:36.62]Game sucks!
[123:37.30]It's just like a giant blade.
[123:54.15]All I can hear is noise.
[123:57.41]What do you usually hear?
[123:59.21]White noise.
[124:01.46]I feel like a wave is crashing down on my head right now.
[124:05.66]We're like in the ocean.
[124:12.00]Holy shit, that hurt.
[124:23.50]Oh, ouch.
[124:28.46]We're all dead.
[124:32.32]Not me.
[124:33.80]This glitch just doesn't have enough armor.
[124:35.10]I'm dying.
[124:37.04]How much armor do you have?
[124:40.08]269.
[124:42.19]You shot me in the back.
[124:42.99]I don't think you knew that.
[124:44.91]Oh, I didn't know that.
[124:46.67]Must have been me.
[124:47.75]You shot me right in the ass.
[124:48.73]Blamester, blamester, blamester.
[124:53.58]I wish there wasn't so many bodies on the ground.
[124:57.06]Can't even see the health pack.
[125:06.78]Yeah, I should go flush the toilet.
[125:08.20]Alright, where's our academy?
[125:12.06]Oh, okay, good.
[125:17.42]Yeah, it's a laser chainsaw.
[125:18.58]It's kind of insane.
[125:22.97]Save it for when we really need it.
[125:30.02]You would save it.
[125:32.24]Oh wow, Pharah buff changes.
[125:34.04]Please, Red.
[125:39.55]You guys are lost.
[125:40.49]This way?
[125:45.43]Or do we just wait?
[125:46.15]This way.
[125:54.50]When do you think we get to the stomach gonna take a while you've seen on Moses Jones It was a really good movie Another weapon good we need that I
[126:16.62]I don't like this whole, um, find one enemy thing we're doing.
[126:21.99]And now, like, a whole bunch are going to spawn on top.
[126:23.87]Okay, no, never mind.
[126:26.45]That's it.
[126:28.21]Huh.
[126:29.79]I'll be damned.
[126:31.79]Nice work, guys.
[126:36.53]Oh, I got the plasma whip.
[126:38.49]When I was whipped.
[126:41.63]Whip.
[126:42.57]Underground again.
[126:43.07]Dark prisoner.
[126:43.67]Oh, can that be me and you guys chain me up?
[126:49.30]No!
[126:49.78]I wish I could use this right now.
[126:51.67]Watching ads is hard.
[126:54.03]Here's a dollar.
[126:54.49]Get some Dunkin' Donuts.
[126:55.83]Well, thanks a lot, SonicEye.
[127:18.70]Thanks a lot, dude.
[127:21.77]Woo!
[127:23.45]Yeah, there goes the sex jokes again.
[127:25.13]Mr. Sex Joke Star.
[127:27.33]When he gets in a group of more than two people.
[127:30.67]It has to be sexual and very inappropriate.
[127:33.07]So we're not... Yeah, we're underground still, right?
[127:42.76]Ooh!
[127:43.74]Oh, yeah, okay.
[127:44.72]Okay.
[127:46.68]Uh-oh.
[127:47.16]Anybody here have arachnophobia?
[127:52.46]Prone to seizures?
[127:54.14]Oh, God.
[127:58.40]I'm being pulled.
[128:06.27]I couldn't even, like, see them.
[128:07.57]You can shoot the webs, right?
[128:11.55]Yeah, you can.
[128:12.11]I don't know where I am.
[128:17.46]I think I'm caught by like five webs right now Okay, I'm still stuck I guess on this one Is that reaching?
[128:36.08]No.
[128:36.78]Alright, well we can restart this one then
[128:42.96]Crybaby?
[128:43.98]No, what?
[128:44.62]Just saying we've kind of just all walked out and we're all dead.
[128:48.29]Yeah, see I don't have enough armor on this character.
[128:51.93]We're both dead sitting right here.
[128:55.34]Says the guy that was safe up in the fucking web.
[128:57.60]Uh, destroying the things I was trying to capture my friends.
[129:02.14]Like always you're trying to save my friends.
[129:06.25]When's my turn?
[129:06.97]You're trying to save your friends.
[129:08.23]Did you just get caught in a web again?
[129:11.23]Again?
[129:11.55]That was my first time.
[129:12.85]The other one was intentional.
[129:14.03]Yeah, because I had to come down to the ground to save my friends.
[129:20.50]I wouldn't even have been there.
[129:22.80]Well, this is just to watch out for the webs, I guess.
[129:26.22]It's everywhere.
[129:26.88]Alright.
[129:30.72]I actually don't want these weapons.
[129:33.73]Trying to shoot him.
[129:39.36]Can that reach?
[129:40.94]Is that reaching?
[129:41.54]I can't even tell.
[129:43.10]I don't think I can reach from there.
[129:53.48]I'm killing Galaga up there.
[129:54.82]I didn't have enough armor.
[130:03.55]So we just... What's the deal here?
[130:09.31]I want a different weapon.
[130:10.51]Yeah, these weapons aren't good for here.
[130:12.85]They're not long enough range.
[130:19.75]Oh, hold on.
[130:29.20]I was... Alright, I'm ready.
[130:34.60]Oh, I photoshopped open this whole time.
[130:36.02]Fuck you, photoshop.
[130:37.86]You photoshopping me?
[130:39.21]Wait, I have to photoshop all day when I'm streaming Overwatch, too.
[130:44.97]Whoops.
[130:45.85]Is there a flashlight?
[130:47.77]I thought somebody had something that could light up the hallway, but I guess not.
[130:56.27]Got some money selling snake oil earlier?
[130:58.01]Well, thanks a lot, Arthur.
[131:02.62]Let's do it.
[131:06.38]Pick Trico.
[131:07.84]I will tomorrow.
[131:16.11]I can see your shadow.
[131:17.51]No, no.
[131:22.59]Okay, that one's dead.
[131:44.61]Get him out Can you call some artillery already When are we just gonna gas them, huh?
[132:09.29]That thing on the right is very, very low.
[132:11.41]The one on the right is nearly dead.
[132:14.49]Oh man, this is getting intense.
[132:16.05]Are they not going that far?
[132:19.57]It doesn't look like I'm hitting it.
[132:22.53]It looks like most of these things are out of range.
[132:25.91]We're gonna have to move in here.
[132:27.27]It's shaking around.
[132:30.73]This is covering up all of my screen.
[132:35.79]That one's dead.
[132:36.43]Where's the other one?
[132:38.21]Oh, there's a spider.
[132:39.91]Hello.
[132:40.53]There you are.
[132:46.56]Who's screaming?
[132:47.32]There's a spider.
[132:52.02]He's not happy about getting dentist procedures done to him.
[132:57.03]Oh, here comes spiders.
[133:00.35]Or ants, whatever.
[133:02.84]Spiders, ants, same thing.
[133:04.26]Same thing.
[133:04.84]I went to, like, grade school then quit.
[133:08.90]How did this guy get behind us?
[133:14.71]I got stuck on your leg and I couldn't get off of it.
[133:18.49]Yeah, just blamester.
[133:27.75]What the fuck?
[133:30.55]What did you just do to me?
[133:32.46]I didn't do anything.
[133:33.88]You got hit by a shotgun blast of cheetos.
[133:36.54]No, no, that can't be what happened.
[133:38.54]Maybe it is what happened.
[133:47.03]Oh, cool.
[133:47.43]This is a healing thing.
[133:48.65]Nice.
[133:49.69]It's so hard to see in here.
[133:54.63]Kill them.
[133:56.69]There's only one behind us still.
[133:57.81]I can't summon a mech until some die.
[134:06.70]Jeez.
[134:11.91]Hey, Arcadum.
[134:13.91]These healing bubbles only last for like 10 seconds, so if you see one and you're hurt, just walk into it.
[134:22.20]Because I only have a limited amount.
[134:24.60]Healing bubble?
[134:25.46]You got bubbles over here?
[134:30.30]Are there any more of those spiders?
[134:31.36]There's gotta be an ant hole up there somewhere.
[134:33.04]Yeah.
[134:35.00]I'm going to assume that as well.
[134:36.34]I bet there's dumb spiders that are over there.
[134:42.09]Ah.
[134:44.91]Shit.
[134:50.75]I still haven't figured out how to shoot.
[134:52.01]Do you need to shoot the webs that are connected to you?
[134:55.44]You have to shoot the giant spider web that it's pulling you towards and destroy that completely.
[135:00.43]Or kill the spider that's on that web.
[135:05.87]Fuck, we're in trouble.
[135:21.08]There's too many bodies in the way!
[135:30.15]Aye, aye, aye.
[135:31.33]Just keep getting pushed back.
[135:37.93]Sometimes you fight so hard.
[135:42.18]We have a second.
[135:47.62]That's a big spider.
[135:52.58]That's right there.
[135:53.53]He's showing his face for some reason.
[135:57.39]Look at this spider.
[136:03.20]You dead?
[136:07.83]Goddamn, here they come again.
[136:08.81]I got turned around.
[136:15.09]I think I might get one of those rapiers for this.
[136:19.98]I'm going to drain all my stamina.
[136:25.68]I'm in deep shit.
[136:26.64]I'm in deep shit.
[136:29.73]Oh my god, I can't get on with you in the way.
[136:31.99]I'm gonna just do this.
[136:34.41]I think I'm useless because I was here to heal you and I don't have any more healing things and I can't call on my thingy anymore and then I have power posts, I guess.
[136:47.30]Crash, crash, crash.
[136:49.13]I'm gonna go forward and see if I can find the, uh... Yeah, I'm dead.
[136:53.05]The guaranteed ant hole.
[136:58.79]I ain't doing that again.
[137:02.13]I want one of those rapiers.
[137:06.92]Hmm.
[137:09.52]Actually, these are probably pretty good here.
[137:11.16]Just try to fly up and kill those things.
[137:13.66]You know what?
[137:14.64]I think I'm gonna try going for some, uh... Tacos?
[137:19.44]Some long-range, like... Tacos?
[137:23.58]Long-range, super explosive damage.
[137:25.47]I'm gonna go with this Dispersal Mortar.
[137:30.15]Heavy mortar?
[137:30.71]Heavy mortar isn't... Now I really want a taco.
[137:45.03]What time is it?
[137:46.53]Nine.
[137:49.97]Maybe like one or two attempts maybe.
[137:52.35]You just made me hungry.
[137:54.97]I need to like eat now.
[138:02.49]I don't think there's anywhere around here I could get a taco unless... Oh, don't tell me.
[138:07.98]Taco?
[138:08.44]Alright, you think it's stupid for me to just fly up there?
[138:15.16]Wow, we can see everything when you do that.
[138:16.70]Oh my god, yeah, that was unbelievable.
[138:21.64]Oh my god, that's perfect!
[138:26.02]I'm aiming for the webs.
[138:29.27]Oh, I just flew into one.
[138:31.35]Like an idiot.
[138:36.57]Hey, that web's down.
[138:42.28]Oh shit, you guys.
[138:43.44]Fucking hell, do these things happen?
[138:46.24]A lot.
[138:47.76]Jesus.
[138:48.22]I don't think there is an an-hole.
[138:56.48]It doesn't matter.
[138:57.38]It's like way up there.
[138:58.46]Your body is being fucking... Come on, Ant.
[139:00.77]Really?
[139:02.87]The Ant's body was making it so I couldn't fucking resurrect you.
[139:05.55]It was just like on top of you.
[139:12.23]Okay.
[139:13.15]I think if you guys just hold up before you go in and let me snipe the webs.
[139:18.52]Then just cover me.
[139:20.16]That's a good idea.
[139:24.34]Alright, here I go.
[139:26.41]I'm getting in front of me.
[139:38.70]I'll protect our Mother Earth from alien attack.
[139:41.28]That's so great that it lights up the whole area.
[139:51.75]I wouldn't be up that far.
[139:57.28]I wouldn't tell me what to do.
[139:59.01]Well, you just got grabbed.
[140:00.35]You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
[140:01.99]No, I didn't.
[140:03.15]Yeah, you did.
[140:04.53]I saw it.
[140:04.85]Okay, that one's down.
[140:08.41]Moving on to the next one.
[140:19.80]Do nothing.
[140:21.46]Yeah, it just lit up and we were just standing right next to each other.
[140:24.26]Okay, reloading.
[140:35.81]Bio arts Not bad pretty good reloading Dude, they like I don't understand how bugs live like can't they just install light in here like Home Depot's right around the corner Got one more over there.
[140:54.81]I Can't snipe it
[141:02.49]Alright, we should probably stay together now at this point.
[141:06.09]Hold on, let's see if I can take out that one back there.
[141:10.63]Work.
[141:11.81]Oh, there is an anhole.
[141:13.60]Where is it?
[141:13.94]Way up top.
[141:14.56]Is it up top?
[141:15.06]Where I am.
[141:15.50]Okay, let's move in.
[141:17.48]Hold on.
[141:17.78]Oh, there's a guy on me.
[141:18.64]There's a guy on me.
[141:23.12]I got it.
[141:23.50]I don't know if there's a second one, but there might be.
[141:25.45]They're all over me.
[141:35.20]Get it?
[141:35.48]The whole thing's an animal.
[141:37.74]Yeah, there's another one where I am.
[141:38.80]Alright, coming to you guys.
[141:43.32]I'm right behind you.
[141:43.93]Okay.
[141:48.03]Gosh, wish I could fucking see a damn thing.
[141:55.49]Yeah, I know.
[141:56.39]I'm just driving in circles right now.
[142:00.08]Where's the other one?
[142:05.68]One more bug.
[142:06.56]Dude, this mission really is just like, fuck you.
[142:09.92]I'm sick of it.
[142:11.18]I'm sick of not being able to see.
[142:15.46]Where's this last bug?
[142:16.66]He's right there.
[142:17.22]I got him.
[142:17.82]Light up the whole area.
[142:18.50]There we go.
[142:18.88]Oh my god.
[142:19.52]Alright, we did it.
[142:23.15]That was not a very fun mission, I'm not gonna lie.
[142:25.89]Normally I'm very into anything, but that was... If I didn't have the mortar, we couldn't see anything.
[142:35.19]Base three?
[142:36.27]I wanna get out of these fucking tunnels.
[142:38.25]We're doing it again.
[142:39.07]If you wanna skip this, I have the mission after this.
[142:44.20]I don't wanna be in a tunnel anymore.
[142:45.50]I'm depressed.
[142:47.44]Do you think I should, uh, keep my mortars?
[142:49.76]In case we run into more dumb shit?
[142:52.20]Oh, well, we have to fight a queen, so that would be sad to miss.
[142:54.81]Yeah, well, don't miss that.
[142:58.29]Guess I'll keep it for the... Yeah, hold on.
[143:00.63]The shit that you were using in Arcadum was amazing.
[143:06.43]I don't know what the hell to use.
[143:16.64]I don't know.
[143:18.30]I'll just stick with the Dryden, true.
[143:20.15]Why not?
[143:28.95]Go in another tunnel.
[143:37.23]Let's go.
[143:39.82]Remember, I'm slow.
[143:40.96]I'm huge dumb and slow.
[143:44.10]I will never forget.
[143:44.96]Huge dumb and slow.
[143:54.62]I'm going in with no armor.
[143:56.09]What are you doing?
[143:58.77]Arcatum killed me, I guess.
[144:00.23]I wasn't even scared of any ants.
[144:01.65]I'm going in again.
[144:02.47]Why are you going in like that?
[144:03.99]You're going to...
[144:08.00]Don't you want to get out of the tunnels?
[144:09.96]I am the damage.
[144:16.75]Well, I gotta follow him.
[144:21.67]What are you doing all the way down here?
[144:25.75]Leading by example.
[144:27.53]I'm slow.
[144:30.75]You are causing so many problems.
[144:34.99]What's the problem?
[144:38.35]Arcadum is slow.
[144:40.25]He's a big heavy tank man.
[144:41.35]I know.
[144:44.21]Beat up.
[144:53.62]This way, I think.
[144:59.70]Queen.
[145:03.97]Where are we going?
[145:05.09]Eh.
[145:07.25]Uh, did you hear that guy's voice?
[145:09.89]I can't even see my hands in front of my face.
[145:16.93]Yeah, you gotta do the dance.
[145:23.07]Well, there's a shitload of people here.
[145:31.68]You just have no fear, huh?
[145:35.97]Oh, now it's the spugly dangles.
[145:38.13]Now I have a little bit of fear.
[145:46.31]One day I'll catch up.
[145:50.27]It's easy to die to spugly dangles.
[145:53.61]You guys want to wait for me, or... No, I would love to.
[145:58.36]He's Mr. Speedman.
[146:00.92]It's a speedrun.
[146:01.60]You said you have to go eat tacos.
[146:02.86]Like, this is the end of the stream.
[146:04.16]Like, let's hurry it up.
[146:06.81]No, I said you may be hungry.
[146:11.99]I don't have access to tacos.
[146:16.28]Would that be great if you did, though?
[146:20.86]Oof!
[146:22.66]I wasn't even in the tunnel.
[146:25.20]I was to the left of the tunnel.
[146:31.53]Watch a real hero arcade him.
[146:35.38]You're doing a sissy long-range strat, why don't you get like a real weapon and get up in close and personal?
[146:41.78]I would, but we're not on the appropriate level to use the weapons I want to use.
[146:45.96]I'm very... Yeah, we can't get out.
[146:49.11]We're stuck inside their bodies.
[146:50.89]Who's got the Drano?
[146:52.91]Nobody, we don't have any rapiers.
[146:54.43]Oh my god.
[147:00.52]Alright, hold on, there's stuff here.
[147:08.62]I'm gonna be playing The Last Guardian tomorrow.
[147:12.50]This was just like an off-schedule, um... decided to play EDF again with Star and Arcadum.
[147:17.78]No shit, Mr. Doctor, man.
[147:22.97]Well, here's, uh... Okay, I... I'm gonna fill that tunnel full of death if you'll let him get up here.
[147:30.43]Okay.
[147:32.49]Uh, you could do it, but Star's in the tunnel all the way in.
[147:39.76]Are you coming back up?
[147:43.26]Okay, Arcadum, you can play.
[147:44.66]Here it comes.
[147:49.10]Woo!
[147:52.89]They're just around the corner.
[147:54.01]I can't see them.
[147:55.09]Woo!
[147:59.79]Done!
[148:00.93]Damn it!
[148:02.30]I'll get him.
[148:03.06]I'll get him.
[148:11.23]You've got to stop killing your teammates, Arkaden.
[148:13.13]A lot of boxes.
[148:22.80]There are.
[148:23.34]Reloading.
[148:27.52]Lots of stuff.
[148:28.82]Oh, that's a lot of stuff.
[148:30.46]Wow.
[148:32.14]Man.
[148:33.73]Jackpot.
[148:34.91]I think we just hit the jackpot.
[148:44.57]Alright, we're, uh... This has to be the end, right?
[148:51.53]Uh-oh, Banelings.
[148:52.71]See, I carried him.
[148:53.49]I'll be your friend.
[148:55.34]Alright.
[149:03.06]Ow.
[149:04.78]That was our kid.
[149:05.40]Stop!
[149:09.79]Alright.
[149:12.07]Fill it.
[149:12.39]Moving into position.
[149:13.27]Ah, my eyes!
[149:15.44]I'm gonna be back here with these guys shooting the wall.
[149:24.96]Oh my god, why do their corpses... Buzz, buzz.
[149:32.64]Buzz.
[149:32.94]Do you have enough health to get him?
[149:49.26]Thank you.
[149:52.90]Too many things.
[149:55.92]I did it.
[149:56.26]What did you do?
[149:57.15]What did you do?
[149:58.23]You guys should play careful.
[149:59.33]Like, not just go in like that.
[150:00.57]Because now if we die, like, we've been a long time on this mission, that would suck.
[150:04.61]Yeah.
[150:05.63]Yeah.
[150:06.51]Wouldn't that just be not so swell?
[150:22.02]Queen right over there?
[150:22.74]That's not a queen, that's just a regular dumb spider.
[150:32.51]Where's the queen?
[150:36.63]Oh, you dick!
[150:38.95]I need it more than you.
[150:39.67]What do you mean you need it more than me?
[150:41.96]Behind us!
[150:43.82]Behind us!
[150:44.08]Oh shit, yeah.
[150:52.37]Alright, what tunnel?
[150:53.57]This one right here?
[150:55.03]Or this one up?
[150:57.07]The Ster tunnel.
[150:59.53]Will you slow down?
[151:04.94]You're giving me diarrhea.
[151:13.34]You just have that by default.
[151:16.12]Really?
[151:16.46]No, I'm good.
[151:34.79]Got it.
[151:37.29]Every morning.
[151:38.53]I said, I'm shooting him.
[151:39.70]I'm shooting him.
[151:42.10]Oh, Star?
[151:42.36]Alright, well if you're gonna do that, I'm gonna get out of the way.
[151:44.98]No, no, no.
[151:45.26]I'm not gonna.
[151:47.16]Not on purpose, at least.
[151:48.44]You shoot me, who's gonna play Battlefield with you?
[151:51.24]You won't!
[151:53.26]Sure.
[152:02.70]Loading.
[152:06.02]One more little ant to the left.
[152:08.06]Cost $200,000.
[152:09.48]Shoot this weapon.
[152:12.24]Oh, no.
[152:13.02]$1,200.
[152:13.10]Let's see if they can outsmart.
[152:24.75]Nope.
[152:25.87]That's the wrong way.
[152:26.91]I think we probably got to drop down.
[152:28.91]Is it?
[152:29.25]Are you sure that's the wrong way?
[152:32.45]It had a big giant thing in it.
[152:34.13]Our guys are going this way.
[152:37.92]Yeah, there's like a way to go, I think.
[152:39.66]Oh, here you are.
[152:40.30]Here you are.
[152:40.80]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[152:41.32]Go where Jeremy went.
[152:42.28]Yeah, there's like a place to go.
[152:43.56]I went down a different tunnel.
[152:45.95]I'm gonna just get Aaron and wait for you guys.
[152:52.09]Here's giving you the Hershey squirts.
[152:53.89]Oh, gross.
[152:55.19]Let's kill the thing before you can see it.
[152:58.63]Thanks, dude.
[153:03.61]Wait, you want to kill the boss before I can see the boss?
[153:06.67]Yeah.
[153:10.42]I don't think that's going to happen.
[153:12.50]We can try.
[153:12.92]Why are these tunnels so long?
[153:14.24]Because we're in the tunnel phase.
[153:20.92]I need health, too, pretty badly.
[153:23.78]I'm going to be honest.
[153:31.59]What is happening?
[153:32.93]What is fucking happening right now?
[153:35.71]What is happening?
[153:36.41]I'm running away.
[153:37.47]What the fuck was that?
[153:40.35]Uh... Blood Mountain?
[153:42.44]I don't know.
[153:42.98]Yeah, hang back, Arcadum.
[153:47.10]It's just... We just got, like, blood gassed in there.
[153:52.32]I've been asking when we're just gonna gas them.
[153:58.87]Oh, it's...
[154:00.11]Is it a queen?
[154:01.62]Yeah.
[154:02.54]It's right around the corner just spraying sperm everywhere.
[154:06.02]Our guys are here now.
[154:12.58]Oh boy.
[154:14.08]Oh!
[154:14.30]What?
[154:14.70]These are huge!
[154:16.81]They're huge!
[154:18.79]Don't die, Jerma.
[154:19.63]Don't die, Jerma.
[154:20.49]Don't die, Jerma.
[154:21.21]I have 58 HP.
[154:25.63]Just play really slow.
[154:26.77]All the EDF guys are in the front.
[154:29.41]There's a bunch of health kits here for when you finally find a moment.
[154:33.45]You know, just play slow, cautiously.
[154:35.09]Don't just dive in there.
[154:37.64]Somebody should take your own advice.
[154:38.84]This is my fetish.
[154:48.42]I'm covered in bodies.
[154:50.04]God!
[154:52.72]How many more are there?
[154:53.78]Good thing I have the bouncy gun.
[155:02.96]I might have an opportunity here in like 10 seconds or so.
[155:07.71]Wait.
[155:09.25]No, not yet.
[155:18.85]How many boys have we got up there?
[155:19.87]Oh, God.
[155:20.31]There's so much of that shit still spraying.
[155:23.64]It's too much of that acid spray.
[155:28.72]After this push, there's like three or four here.
[155:31.24]Wait.
[155:31.84]No, not yet.
[155:38.24]Looks like they're pushing through.
[155:39.24]Oh, here they come.
[155:40.62]Here comes more.
[155:41.42]Here comes Acid.
[155:48.60]You should be good because the EDF are pushed up a bit.
[155:50.72]I mean, but is there Acid in there coming over here?
[155:52.38]No, it's not coming in here.
[155:55.12]Yeah.
[155:55.84]It's getting stuck on the wall.
[155:58.94]Oh, here it is.
[156:01.48]Oh.
[156:07.20]Covering part.
[156:10.19]Yikes.
[156:10.61]Alright.
[156:19.96]Opportunity.
[156:20.48]No, not yet.
[156:20.98]No, no, no.
[156:21.32]Gas.
[156:23.42]I think it's dead.
[156:29.59]No, the queen's not dead.
[156:31.47]Yeah, the queen died.
[156:32.51]Wait, we killed the queen?
[156:33.51]Yeah.
[156:36.09]Well, get help.
[156:40.92]I'm gonna laugh my ass off.
[156:41.78]There's more than one queen.
[156:42.78]I'm gonna laugh my ass off when we all die to this gas.
[156:45.68]Like right now.
[156:52.06]Oh, no, there's some more.
[156:56.56]There's another one in the back left you can see moving around.
[157:00.52]That will shoot the stuff all over you.
[157:03.22]Where?
[157:05.20]There it is.
[157:06.02]There's the queen.
[157:19.25]I'm not against the wall.
[157:20.13]I'm against the wall.
[157:20.67]I'm against the wall.
[157:22.23]I'm dead here I'm so dead
[157:40.47]No.
[157:43.45]There was not a clean- I showed where it was.
[157:50.88]I looked my mouse up and it was a fucking scary game.
[157:56.10]It was a scary game.
[157:59.16]Let's get out of the goddamn tunnel.
[158:16.92]Alright, I'm gonna get food.
[158:18.06]No, last mission.
[158:19.70]We get one mission out of the tunnel and we're all done.
[158:22.57]I'm done after this.
[158:25.19]That was just like... What the fuck?
[158:37.42]Uninstall it.
[158:54.25]That was pretty perfect, though.
[158:56.55]Oh, is there a queen left?
[158:57.43]I think there's a queen left.
[158:58.14]Yeah, right up there!
[158:59.62]Where?
[158:59.88]It was... It was a scripted... That was a scripted moment.
[159:09.46]I better put my shoe on my head.
[159:11.38]Because otherwise this stream is just... This is a video.
[159:18.81]What?
[159:21.17]From my perspective, it was very, very weird.
[159:30.81]Alright, win or lose, this is it.
[159:32.35]I'm going after this one.
[159:35.79]Oh, good.
[159:41.11]Mother ship!
[159:47.51]Yeah, I think we're gonna die actually.
[159:49.27]But at least we'll die above ground.
[159:51.65]Yeah, at least we'll die.
[159:52.59]This is the first mission we've played that's had things to stand on.
[159:57.31]We've been in an open field and then inside of a fucking colon.
[160:09.76]That's pleasant to look at.
[160:10.92]I'm sorry.
[160:12.22]Is it shooting right now?
[160:15.25]Is the mothership going to kill me instantly like right now?
[160:18.43]I hope not.
[160:22.89]I do think it shoots at one point or another.
[160:24.61]Oh, like that?
[160:29.66]At that point.
[160:30.38]Mm-hmm.
[160:37.27]I so badly want another one of these laser lightning rifles.
[160:40.09]They're so good.
[160:41.43]It's the best fucking weapon in the game for me.
[160:43.11]I'm feeling such a crybaby.
[160:52.11]Like, so what?
[160:52.77]Your hometown's getting blown up.
[160:54.28]Is there a girl?
[160:55.02]Do you love her?
[160:56.10]She's what you're fighting for.
[160:57.08]Okay, now that you say that, I'm ready.
[161:03.10]Got a girl back home.
[161:07.07]Hold on.
[161:08.39]How do we fight that?
[161:11.45]We gotta take out all the shield guys?
[161:13.50]I know we have to do that.
[161:14.48]There's a lot of red ants over here.
[161:17.26]Let's stay together to the left.
[161:20.72]I can fly in and get rid of the shield person, but I can't really take care of the ants surrounding it.
[161:26.53]I can go in and handle the ants.
[161:29.53]Yeah, let's all just go to the left then.
[161:30.99]Going in.
[161:36.64]On the ants?
[161:38.45]Oh god, he's aiming it right at me.
[161:52.76]Destruction!
[161:57.50]Oh, yay!
[162:01.80]I'm stuck looking at a wall.
[162:04.88]Oh!
[162:05.12]We got Red Ant behind you!
[162:07.74]Red Ant!
[162:08.96]My little Red Ant!
[162:12.16]We're good.
[162:12.74]It's really hot.
[162:13.56]Which way am I even jumping?
[162:15.18]Face the right way, you piece of shitter.
[162:18.62]Alright, going in.
[162:20.06]It's too late.
[162:22.35]Nefarian's corruption has taken hold.
[162:25.81]A fury of Blackrock!
[162:39.80]What am I doing?
[162:41.00]Where am I going?
[162:44.14]Oh, yeah, follow me.
[162:44.94]I'm the giant mech guy.
[162:47.56]Oh shit.
[162:49.02]Oh shit.
[162:52.11]Okay, fine.
[162:53.53]I thought I was dead.
[162:54.19]Watch out for the giant again.
[163:03.13]Leave it to Beaver.
[163:04.97]You want me to go in and do a little bit of a kung fu chop on that guy?
[163:09.22]A little bit of a kung fu chop?
[163:12.04]I'm going for a kung fu chop on this dude.
[163:13.84]You ready?
[163:15.86]Wait, which guy?
[163:18.60]That guy.
[163:19.59]The bad guys.
[163:21.29]There's too many ants.
[163:23.23]Hold on.
[163:26.05]I see exactly what I want.
[163:27.81]It's that super health pack.
[163:29.87]It's that bubble gum right there.
[163:31.90]Got it.
[163:35.77]That didn't work.
[163:37.83]Oh no, Arcadum.
[163:42.83]I'm dead.
[163:43.31]Oh no, Jerma.
[163:44.63]I'm dead.
[163:48.67]Oh, you're in a mech guy.
[163:51.03]I kind of was all over the place there.
[163:59.34]Please die.
[164:00.44]Oh, now we get fliers.
[164:04.68]Oh, you're both dead.
[164:05.70]Oh yeah, we're both.
[164:06.50]Oh yeah.
[164:06.78]This game's too easy on normal, you know what I mean?
[164:16.11]Is this normal or hard?
[164:17.77]This is hard.
[164:18.37]Yeah, what are we talking about?
[164:22.28]Did you say it's too easy on normal and too hard on hard?
[164:26.30]Well, you have to do easy mode, normal mode, before you can play hard mode, have fun mode.
[164:30.92]I know, I know, and we're just doing it wrong.
[164:36.04]You're supposed to play through the entire game on normal, and then you play like Mission 1 on hard.
[164:43.80]I mean, that's just an endless cycle.
[164:46.53]I think we're dead.
[164:50.01]We were dead the second you wanted tacos, anyway.
[164:54.71]Alright.
[164:55.91]We gave it our all, boys!
[164:57.49]Yeah, if you can do a Corsus through my veins, really good.
[165:01.47]Not like half-ass it.
[165:04.37]Me?
[165:04.91]Yeah, Arcadum could probably do it pretty well.
[165:08.51]He needs an example.
[165:10.08]Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.
[165:12.46]No, the Velstra.
[165:16.16]From Hearthstone.
[165:18.28]Oh!
[165:20.02]Oh, I don't know the line.
[165:22.14]Yeah, we'll blame the tacos.
[165:24.02]Wait, what?
[165:26.16]That was pretty fun, though.
[165:27.26]Oh, it was really fun.
[165:28.76]We were just playing... Man...
[165:32.99]I'll never forget that moment.
[165:33.97]It's like, oh, where's the queen?
[165:35.03]Let me just light the room up.
[165:37.47]That was fucking terrifying.
[165:39.79]Hey, stop smashing stuff over there, Star.
[165:43.07]What are you doing?
[165:44.01]What?
[165:44.23]I was doing some typing.
[165:48.21]No, see, right now, we jumped in the deep end.
[165:50.74]We're like six-year-olds, and we're not supposed to be in the deep end.
[165:56.52]we have to wait till we get a little older like once we get to be like once we get to be like 25 we can once we get to be 22 to 25 we can go to the deep end that's what it's like in my family look 750 armor 700 armor oh Jerma Jerma hey hey hey it's because I'm playing wing diver you know that like like maybe like 50 more than this 60 more than this okay how much do you have 364.
[166:32.09]I don't even play Winged Dagger anymore.
[166:33.47]I almost got as much as you should.
[166:34.93]Like, a hundred... I mean, god damn.
[166:37.65]How many hours do you have in the game so far?
[166:39.55]Three.
[166:40.76]Three hours in the game so far.
[166:42.14]You have three hours in EDF.
[166:44.26]Yeah.
[166:45.64]Oh, well, that's... Okay, that's interesting.
[166:48.80]Times that by ten.
[166:50.82]Hold on.
[166:51.60]Hold on.
[166:55.26]No, it's...
[166:56.70]Uh, more like 131 hours.
[166:57.77]Nice try, Ster.
[167:00.29]He's 131 hours in this game?
[167:02.73]Yes, as he is.
[167:04.63]Wow.
[167:05.29]Oh, excuse me.
[167:05.93]33 hours.
[167:06.41]131 is what I heard first.
[167:07.87]That's what I'm going with.
[167:09.71]Okay.
[167:13.08]33 hours.
[167:13.78]Alright, so you have double the amount of game time as me, I think.
[167:16.34]I'm a gamer.
[167:20.30]He's a real gamer.
[167:21.32]No, you're not.
[167:23.12]I'm a gamer.
[167:24.46]Oh, speaking of which, how's Last Guardian?
[167:26.82]It's good.
[167:27.98]I'm probably going to finish it tomorrow.
[167:31.49]On this stream.
[167:34.33]Alright.
[167:34.81]I'm having fun.
[167:36.29]That's going to be it.
[167:38.99]I need to get food.
[167:39.73]I'm going to find dinner too then.
[167:42.20]Alright, I guess I'll sit here by myself.
[167:44.86]By the way, if you're wondering who this was, this is Arcadum.
[167:48.08]Oh, by the way, it's like a full paragraph introduction.
[167:51.40]Put him on the spot.
[167:52.34]Arcadum.
[167:53.10]He's a good dude.
[167:54.10]Arcadum.
[167:55.08]The twitch.tv/Arcadum, right?
[167:57.12]Yeah, that's it.
[167:59.18]He's a dude.
[168:00.28]Check him out.
[168:02.62]And thanks for playing, guys.
[168:04.28]It was fun.
[168:05.02]We got stuck on one, but you know, you get stuck on hard levels sometimes when you play these games.
[168:11.83]I'll talk to you guys later.

[168:51.64]Highly recommend it.
[168:52.66]It'll probably go on sale.
[168:54.02]I'm not sure I'll stream it again.
[168:55.26]We'll see.
[168:56.46]But I'll see you guys tomorrow night for The Last Guardian.

[169:56.65]EDF is always... Even when you lose and you get angry, it's one of those games.
[169:59.79]It's like Dark Souls.
[170:01.43]You're just like, one more time, one more time.
