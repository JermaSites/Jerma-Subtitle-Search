[10:01.29]Is that him right there?
[10:02.21]Is that Larry?
[10:04.87]My best friend from high school.
[10:07.35]Larry.

[10:28.92]Oh, it's going to get harder.
[10:32.38]Okay.
[10:32.58]I forget what he looks like.
[10:35.91]I'm actually not kidding.
[10:36.67]I don't remember what he looks like.
[10:37.95]I just clicked on him.
[10:42.17]Is that him right there?
[10:44.32]You found Larry.
[10:45.56]Oh, I got him.
[10:46.12]Alright.

[10:59.41]Alright, Larry.
[11:00.13]Larry.
[11:07.19]I forget what he looks like again.
[11:09.15]What the hell does he look like?
[11:30.29]I've looked at every single person's face and I don't see him.
[11:36.73]Wait.
[11:38.36]There he is.
[11:40.06]Okay.
[11:42.02]He's bald head.
[11:44.04]Hair right here.
[11:44.71]He's got eyes and he's got an open mouth and he's got a red shirt on.
[11:50.91]Okay.
[11:51.67]Look at the bald head.
[12:11.34]nobody heard that that was like an animal coming out of my stomach I don't see him what if he's just not on this level
[12:51.12]I think I got him instantly.
[13:01.31]I got him instantly this time.
[13:02.87]I think I got him instantly.
[13:10.36]I thought he was right here.
[13:17.61]No, that's not him.
[13:23.40]He's kind of a little guy.
[13:24.44]He's a little guy.
[13:30.99]Got him.
[13:35.28]I'm pointing at my screen like a child, that person said.
[13:39.77]He's right there!
[13:40.63]Well, except this time he got a bush light.
[13:45.12]Wait, isn't that the Leonardo DiCaprio thing?
[13:47.48]Where he's like...
[13:52.86]Does anybody else drink these?
[13:54.55]Am I the only person on Earth besides people going fishing?

[14:06.88]Your dad's got taste.
[14:13.09]Okay.
[14:15.63]Where's the... I'm going to turn it up on my end a little.
[14:18.29]A little.
[14:24.79]I'm actually pretty good at this.
[14:29.40]Found him.
[14:30.22]No.
[14:33.38]Not him.
[14:41.71]That, look, that could be a Larry.
[14:43.57]That could be a Larry.
[14:45.18]Could be.
[14:46.70]You should drink Estrella instead.
[14:51.90]That doesn't sound like Bush Light to me.
[14:55.42]There's only one beer that I drink.
[14:59.14]We all know what it is.
[15:04.93]I don't know why I did this.
[15:05.89]I was talking to Holly a couple days ago about this.
[15:11.06]I don't know why I did this.
[15:12.68]I don't know why I'm drinking this.
[15:13.72]I don't know why I'm doing this.
[15:15.85]I don't know why I'm doing this.
[15:17.95]I don't understand.
[15:18.97]But I'm like having fun doing it.
[15:20.15]It's weird.
[15:37.08]Is that not him?
[15:49.10]Somebody said I look depressed, by the way.
[15:50.58]I'm doing just fine.
[15:57.07]Why'd he even say that?
[15:58.05]Found him.
[16:00.54]You found Larry.
[16:07.04]alright I gotta find him faster okay if I don't find him hey bros if I don't find Larry in 30 seconds uh the rest of this bush light's going down not the timer 30 29 I don't count I don't have count
[16:41.53]You found Larry.
[16:49.08]Hey, do a blind taste test with Bush and other beers to see if he truly loves it.
[16:56.61]That's weird.
[16:59.55]That's... I don't know.
[17:00.23]Do I want to do that?
[17:01.33]I don't know what other beers I would put next to Bush.
[17:03.80]...
[17:11.41]Wait, I'm gonna get Bud Light?
[17:15.18]No thanks.
[17:17.52]This is a bush family.

[17:31.23]Wait, what the hell is that?
[17:31.90]He's right there!

[17:39.30]Why's it being so weird?
[17:42.09]Wait, what?
[17:42.75]Did he leave?
[17:43.24]I'm so confused.
[17:46.22]What the hell was that?
[17:49.32]That was weird.
[17:56.42]That was weird.
[17:58.10]That was very odd.
[18:03.29]I didn't even notice that for a full probably five seconds.
[18:05.69]YouTuber commentary?
[18:06.81]Shut the fuck up.
[18:12.94]That was weird.
[18:29.43]Stop making me aware of my own- of my own craft, okay?
[18:50.42]He's gonna be- wait.
[18:52.86]Who's that?
[18:55.49]There's a little weird guy right there.
[19:12.67]Where the hell is he?
[19:25.67]He's right there?
[19:26.11]Ah, right there.
[19:30.66]Oh shit, no, he got purple hair.
[19:32.00]I don't want to look over at chat because it'll be cheating because someone's going to say where he is.
[19:53.28]Why can I not find him in this one?
[20:06.00]Where the hell is he?
[20:13.95]That's not him!
[20:24.62]This one's hard.
[20:26.27]They got harder.
[20:34.64]Stop cheating.
[20:42.29]I didn't see anything.
[20:43.37]I didn't even look.
[21:05.32]Where the hell is he?
[21:17.61]No.
[21:18.96]No, he's not over here.
[21:22.88]Are you alright?

[21:26.23]Tunnel vision?
[21:27.33]What do you mean?
[21:29.01]He's not even here.
[21:33.42]Okay, honestly, where the hell is he?
[21:50.46]I like this guy.
[21:58.48]I like that guy.
[22:13.38]Am I stupid?
[22:15.02]How have I not found him?
[22:17.02]Am I stupid?
[22:32.98]No, I'm not.
[22:40.30]I'm not.
[22:42.57]He's not up here.
[22:56.68]He's not even here.
[22:57.34]He doesn't even exist.
[22:58.17]He's not in the game.

[25:06.92]In a perpetual game of You Found Larry?
[25:17.38]I want to get up and dance.

[28:25.84]This is... What, what, what?
[29:01.03]Alright, that one was weird.
[29:02.19]Got ya.
[29:09.01]He hasn't said anything in like three times.
[29:10.25]I'm in the bathroom?
[29:12.62]This is weird.
[29:13.54]I don't like being in this.
[29:14.64]Wait, what?
[29:41.00]You don't have any idea what you're doing.
[29:42.43]Are you with them?

[31:59.63]What up?
[32:03.40]Great commentary.
[32:07.58]That was delayed.
[32:08.36]That was not a fake reaction.
[32:19.86]It was just very delayed.
[32:24.49]I swear to God that was real.
[32:37.06]Can you please get out of the way?
[32:38.06]Notice you've been keeping a close eye on somebody.

[42:21.10]Because I thought this moment would never come.
[42:22.99]The moment where I put a bullet through your sick skull.
[42:45.67]Huh?
[43:04.44]What the fuck, dude?
[43:08.99]Somebody kill him.
[43:10.11]Somebody kill him.
[43:10.49]That was a good guy.
[43:13.05]That was a good guy.
[43:18.73]I was a good guy.
[43:31.81]What the fuck?
[43:34.25]Now he's weird.
[43:35.11]Now he's weird.
[43:51.76]What the fuck do I do?
[43:52.92]Do I shoot him?
[43:55.70]You couldn't just leave me alone, could you?
[43:57.82]Larry, Larry, it's me, your friend from high school.
[44:00.69]I thought I had a good thing going until you came along and ruined everything.
[44:07.04]Looks like I needed a place to hide.
[44:08.38]I wonder if you'll scream as much as he did.
[44:13.51]I got a gun still, right?
[44:23.24]Oh, I don't like this.
[44:25.09]I don't like this.
[44:27.49]This is cool.
[44:28.29]Cool game.
[44:29.05]Good game.
[44:30.31]Thumbs up for sure.
[44:38.02]Yeah.
[44:38.92]Fuck you.
[44:39.82]Oh, good one.
[44:40.28]That was a good one.
[44:41.26]That's got to be it.
[44:41.76]Distressing news coming from the quiet town of Middlewood this morning.
[44:48.41]Where a dismembered body of a man was discovered today at Middlewood Park.
[44:55.37]The police cordoned off the park and discovered trash bags that had been buried underground.
[45:03.21]Attempts to identify the body have proven difficult as the authorities state that the face of the man had been removed.
[45:19.98]The police are asking for anyone to step forward with any information or anyone who might have seen or heard anything in Middlewood Park between the hours of 8 a.m.
[45:29.71]and 9 a.m.
[45:31.71]He's now streaming as you.
[45:32.95]The extreme graphic nature of this crime bears an uncanny resemblance to the Willie Mack murders that haunted the town for many years.
[45:46.47]Oh, no, that was just silly.
[45:50.29]Willie Mack, notorious for the murder and mutilation of 17 people between 1996 and 1999.
[45:58.18]Some of the most graphic of the murders committed in the town of Middlewood.
[46:02.77]Alright.
[46:04.43]In the year 2001, he was apprehended and sentenced to life in prison.
[46:10.33]Although, only last year, Mr. Mack was presumed dead when a prisoner transport vehicle relocating him crashed and burst into flames.
[46:22.01]The Middlewood Police will be issuing a statement shortly.
[46:25.19]But for now, we go over to Tom for the weather.
[46:28.40]Take it away, Tom!
[46:30.30]This guy's acting too weird.
[46:31.46]This is going to be weird.
[46:33.64]I fucking hate this job.
[46:36.27]That's going to be him right there.
[46:38.57]Uh, Tom?
[46:40.91]Oh, yes.
[46:42.11]Thanks, Jerry.
[46:43.25]It's gonna be a beautiful day, folks.
[46:45.76]Sunny spells all around.
[46:47.86]There's a comedy ending.
[46:53.31]That's alright.
[46:54.73]That's good.
[46:55.29]Clap.
[46:56.73]Clap, clap, clap, clap.
[46:58.18]Good work.
[46:59.96]That was called, uh, Let's Find Larry.
[47:04.43]Let's Find Larry.
[47:08.74]We're going to go right into the next one.
[47:11.02]Wait.
[47:23.99]I don't know.
[47:24.27]This is going right back to the desktop.
[47:29.90]Alright.
[47:30.12]Let's get the next one open.
[47:31.74]Next coming up.
[47:34.78]Hmm.
[47:37.09]There's so many.
[47:38.81]I think I'm going to do... How about this one?
[47:51.47]How about Blood Bark?
[47:54.82]This one's called Blood Bark.
[48:07.38]Jesus.
[48:14.09]Okay.
[48:18.91]Bloodbark.
[48:20.88]Should I turn it up?
[48:23.02]Kind of low.
[48:29.67]Day one.
[48:37.55]My job... Oh, that hurts my head.
[48:40.20]My job had never been in such high demand.
[48:42.82]A new exotic kind of tree had been discovered.
[48:48.21]And its price was sky high.
[48:50.96]The blood diamonds of the forest.
[48:56.39]Okay.
[49:06.25]Yeah, I got an axe.
[49:07.96]Can I?
[49:08.48]Hold on a second.
[49:09.14]Let me see.
[49:09.46]Can I just?
[49:14.20]There we go.
[49:15.54]Okay, full screen.
[49:23.41]I just smashed my bed with an axe.
[49:25.82]I didn't want to do that.
[49:26.52]Wait, can I do that to everything?
[49:30.34]What happens if I chop the fucking house down?
[49:44.09]Is that structural integrity?
[49:45.59]Good morning, forest.
[49:51.24]I found one of those trees further ahead.
[49:52.80]It would best... It would best if I focus my time on just chopping those down.
[49:58.93]Also, don't hit my bed with an axe.
[50:11.89]Is there a sprint?
[50:30.98]This one right here?
[50:51.22]That would be the last chunk.
[50:56.11]I'll put it with the rest of the cabin and rest until tomorrow.
[51:00.25]It's a meat tree?
[51:04.41]Apparently it's a meat tree.
[51:08.26]Oh, this one is fucked up.
[51:26.43]Go on.
[51:36.64]Hey!
[51:42.45]Must have been some drunk idiot.
[51:46.84]Shake the lava lamp?
[51:57.14]The lava lamp is gonna do whatever it wants.
[52:00.10]The best part about a lava lamp is you don't control what it does.
[52:02.86]It just decides what it's going to do with its small insect brain.
[52:07.31]Okay?
[52:07.95]The brain is up here.
[52:10.21]I don't want to expose the brain.
[52:12.22]But see?
[52:13.14]There's a brain up here.
[52:14.02]I don't want to expose the brain.
[52:17.51]It's going to do whatever it wants.
[52:22.31]I'll leave this chunk on the...
[52:24.59]Oh my god, that was a scary guy.
[52:26.73]I thought that was a meat guy sitting out the window.
[52:29.59]I thought that was a meat guy.
[52:30.53]I was about to be- I was about to scream.
[52:35.78]Where do I put it?
[52:36.34]In a pile?
[52:42.47]It's a pile of leaves.
[52:44.49]Where's this meat pile?
[52:48.08]Leave the chunk on the pile with the others before I could get comfy.
[52:51.94]Isn't it a pile?
[52:58.15]Oh.
[53:01.07]And now for a well-deserved rest.
[53:05.72]Something's gonna scream at me.
[53:13.93]Your elbow's gonna knock the lava lamp over?
[53:17.00]I've tested so many times.
[53:19.74]I'm gonna be fine.
[53:23.33]Nutrition W. That's a W, yo.
[53:53.25]Alright, do it again.
[53:56.55]Your arms looking real skinny today?
[54:01.18]What the fuck do you know?
[54:02.84]Huh?
[54:04.74]What do you know?
[54:05.54]Huh?
[54:07.15]What do you know?
[54:12.49]I'm wearing black, it's slimming.
[54:21.61]That was the only tree I knew about.
[54:26.32]There must be some more.
[54:27.06]I just need to find a different route.
[54:31.15]Small in comparison to that big noggin.
[54:32.87]I actually kind of have a small head.
[54:36.53]I don't have a big head.
[54:37.21]My head is small.
[54:39.28]If I break that rope, no one will notice.
[54:46.14]I made a bush light joke on Joel's stream and he didn't get the reference.
[54:49.85]Why would he?
[54:54.77]Why would he get the reference?
[55:03.92]You can't go to somebody else's stream and say, hey, man, maybe you should have a bush light.
[55:07.95]They're going to go, okay, that sounds gross.
[55:11.49]And then you're going to go, hey, I got you, man.
[55:14.45]They're going to be like, I don't, why?
[55:15.75]This is oddly satisfying.
[55:25.69]It kind of is.
[55:27.15]Your head looks big.
[55:30.67]Is it lava lamp?
[55:31.49]Shut up.
[55:33.47]Is the lava lamp a way to have a subway surfers-esque entertainment for chat?
[55:38.29]Yes.
[55:44.58]Just wait till there's four of them back there.
[55:52.77]Big head ass streamer.
[55:55.67]My head is a perfectly small size.
[55:58.95]It's the hair.
[55:59.53]I got big hair.
[56:02.48]I got a big chest too.
[56:06.62]And I could, I could fucking squeeze.
[56:09.58]You understand?
[56:10.08]I could squeeze hard.
[56:13.49]Don't fuck around.
[56:14.87]I can squeeze.
[56:15.89]You give me like one of those things, the squeeze test things, I'll break it.
[56:30.42]Is this sap?
[56:31.14]It tastes like blood.
[56:35.06]Oh, don't let it touch you.
[56:37.32]Did I hit it again?
[56:37.85]They warned me about that.
[56:41.69]I didn't think it would be real.
[56:53.44]Alright, just get it done.
[56:54.46]Get it done.
[57:00.35]Alright, last chunk for the day.
[57:02.05]My shirt is ruined.
[57:02.87]I look like a serial killer.
[57:07.48]Is this gonna end up that I'm killing people or something in the forest and I think it's a tree because I'm having like a hallucination or something, right?
[57:30.05]That be wicked fucked up?
[57:31.13]Oh yeah.
[57:44.87]I gotta get ready for when the thing jumps in my face.
[57:50.24]I think this wood is worth so much.
[57:55.83]Why?
[57:56.03]Just because it's red?
[57:57.31]Or is it due to the ones that have to go fetch it?
[58:05.42]Break soon?
[58:06.08]Yep.
[58:06.94]Like four minutes, three minutes.
[58:09.10]First break of the night, gotta get a fresh bush.
[58:28.45]I'm going the wrong way.
[58:31.83]That doesn't sound right.
[58:43.00]Okay, put it on the pile.
[58:52.26]We're good.
[58:55.76]More like Jerma 5'5".
[58:57.18]I'm 5'8".
[59:01.17]You dweeb.
[59:05.77]As some trees fall, some trees stand.
[59:10.58]Some plants are able to evolve during their lifetime.
[59:16.39]They change their characteristics, shaping themselves, depending on their surroundings.
[59:19.37]They knew the sound of my axe.
[59:28.62]I thought you were 5'9".
[59:31.25]I'm 5'9 with shoes, with dress shoes.
[59:33.34]Oh, wait, there's people here.
[59:37.32]Get off my land!
[59:39.42]What are those people doing here?
[59:40.43]Have they been filming while I slept?
[59:45.17]You two do know this is part of the forest is not a public access, right?
[59:49.16]You're the lumberjack they hired.
[59:51.20]Yes, I am.
[59:51.78]And you are the creeps who were filming my cabin while I slept.
[59:54.44]Can you go away now?
[59:56.29]Tell me, are you aware of the dangers surrounding the blood bar trees, which you have been hired to chop down?
[60:05.61]Kind of got nowhere to go.
[60:07.54]This is the worst part about this.
[60:09.90]It's just the three of us.
[60:11.16]I can't just disappear.
[60:12.09]I mean, my cabin literally is right there and I don't even think there's walls.
[60:15.92]There's a wall missing.
[60:19.84]I have to answer these questions.
[60:24.63]Yes, I've been warned of the threat of the trees, I suppose.
[60:28.12]Their cognitive effects, which as you may know, include visual and auditive illusions, lead those who fell the trees to believe they are killing a man instead of a tree.
[60:36.37]Some experts believe this is a survival mechanism this exotic species has developed to survive deforestation.
[60:41.44]What do you think about this?
[60:52.25]I think you got about 15 seconds before you get the fuck off my land.
[60:59.38]I'll add to the fucking news.
[61:02.67]I'm going to take a break.
[61:06.97]The ads are going to stop playing.
[61:09.25]Yeah, you got 15 seconds to get off my property before I start throwing ads at you.
[61:15.76]What do you think about that?
[61:17.95]And I'm going to show it on your news syndication, which you didn't pay for, which weren't licensed, so I'm going to get somebody in trouble.
[61:24.01]Go ahead.
[61:24.23]Get the camera.
[61:24.81]Zoom in.
[61:26.15]You got the camera?
[61:27.07]Zoom it in.
[61:27.60]Come in.
[61:28.18]Right here.
[61:29.18]I'll talk to you.
[61:30.80]But you are not syndicated for these ads.
[61:34.33]Good luck.
[61:36.31]Come on.
[61:36.50]Yeah.
[61:36.74]Good.
[61:37.18]I see the lens moving.
[62:28.85]Yeah, zoom in on that, motherfucker.
[62:32.64]Alright, I'll be right back.
[66:18.82]What's going on?
[66:21.56]Are we ready to see what's going on here?
[66:28.29]Oh, I just kind of jumped back.
[66:29.33]I didn't say anything.
[66:33.52]Okay.
[66:35.52]No, I'm not going to shotgun a beer.
[66:37.36]I'm 40.
[66:38.62]We said this last time.
[66:41.51]Okay, let's go.
[66:46.46]uh trees are smart but not that smart it's not like they understand why we chop them down and if you do know the effects of these trees what made you accept this job they pay a lot there's not many places a lumberjack who can't use machinery could work with a living wage if I start seeing things I'll just know it's the trees if I remember what they do their tricks won't work on me that's an interesting philosophy thanks for allowing us to ask you these questions have a nice day
[67:16.62]Okay, Craig, that's enough.
[67:17.90]Cut.
[67:20.24]So are you leaving now?
[67:22.24]Um, no, asshole.
[67:23.16]You almost ruined our footage.
[67:24.42]We'll film more trees as background footage and then we'll leave.
[67:28.39]Keep on rolling.
[67:28.95]What?
[67:29.33]I answered all the questions completely.
[67:38.88]Okay, I got an achievement.
[67:40.40]The achievement was you tried to kill the lady.
[67:55.14]I guess I'm gonna go get a tree.
[68:04.66]There must be more bloodbark trees on yesterday's path.
[68:11.13]That is ice cold.
[68:30.34]Who's that?
[68:32.43]Who's there?
[68:32.81]That's the one I cut down yesterday.
[69:05.59]Can I get more from this one?
[69:10.48]What, did I hit by hand?
[69:19.38]Alright, there's too much liquid coming out of this one.
[69:40.29]I don't know if I'm supposed to be doing it like this.
[69:48.28]Oh shit, that's too much.
[69:52.07]It's like I have a vacuum cleaner on.
[69:55.97]Oh God.
[70:05.85]Surely I can't do this like a thousand times, right?
[70:32.91]I don't think that's correct.
[70:38.27]It's at the same path from yesterday, though, right?
[70:48.87]Oh, I can't go this way.
[70:56.44]Keep hitting it?
[71:02.23]Keep hitting it.
[71:03.04]Keep hitting it.
[71:04.26]Keep whacking it.
[71:05.48]I don't think I'm supposed to do that.
[71:13.27]Wait, what's this?
[71:15.71]What's this?
[71:17.69]I don't want to hit that.
[71:19.09]I didn't want to hit that.
[71:19.83]That was fucking horrible.
[71:21.10]That was really awful and disrespectful and I'm sorry that I did that.
[71:29.08]Oh, right here.
[71:38.74]It was just a goofy eye, man.
[71:39.90]It's okay.
[71:42.95]Alright, now that you say it like that.
[71:43.93]Alright, that was a guy.
[72:08.23]Last chunk.
[72:09.15]My head hurts.
[72:09.83]My hands are shaking.
[72:17.44]What's going on at the bottom?
[72:19.83]Maybe accepting this job was not a great idea.
[72:23.53]Why do I feel guilt?
[72:24.41]It's just a tree.
[72:39.03]That's my ghost meter.
[72:39.83]It's calibrating.
[72:43.04]Yeah, yeah, I'm picking up senses here.
[72:49.61]Straight ahead, it looks like.
[72:50.77]Ghost meter's saying I think this way.
[72:58.33]I'm gonna scream in my face.
[73:09.89]wolf someone's gonna be right in here fuck off not real it's not real it's not real
[73:39.12]Just the trees.
[73:44.51]No, someone is going to be in my house.
[73:53.93]Day four.
[73:55.15]It is almost uncanny the way they accept death.
[73:58.86]The way they fall without resistance.
[74:01.40]The forest used their deaths as a warning.
[74:03.64]Sign that I should stop.
[74:19.12]Oh, it's just a baby tree.
[74:20.92]Oh my God.
[74:41.72]Get out of the way.
[74:46.71]I guess I could just jump over this, right?
[75:05.30]That same place I just was?
[75:25.06]This is so scary.
[75:53.28]That was not scary at all.
[75:54.62]That was a cartoon sound effect.
[75:57.74]And took me completely out of... I'm completely out of the game now.
[76:02.67]That was a Scooby-Doo motherfucker.
[76:04.53]And now I... I was a little scared and now I'm not at all.
[76:10.37]At the climax of the game... We're gonna put a AOL instant message guy that... Runs away from you?
[76:20.66]This is a giant slingshot?
[76:28.29]I'm sorry.
[76:34.92]Your atmosphere gets a little screwed up when you play the Scooby-Doo runaway sound effect.
[76:48.20]The Fresno Nightcrawler.
[76:52.75]You're acting like that's a breed of snake.
[76:55.07]What are you talking about?
[76:55.87]What is a Fresno Nightcrawler?
[77:10.43]I can't cut this.
[77:16.64]Oh!
[77:19.20]What the fuck is that?
[77:22.09]Find a big-ass cocoon inside the lake.
[77:28.23]Is this gonna open up?
[77:29.34]What is this thing?
[77:34.64]Why am I opening this?
[77:41.33]What the fuck is going on in this game?
[77:49.20]Well, I thought I was cutting trees down.
[77:50.76]I'm letting out giant mosquitoes.
[77:56.36]That was I mean, that was pretty cool, but.
[78:05.69]Yes, I'm going to go this way.
[78:14.64]The way they really messed up is what should have happened is that bug should have came near me and its little proboscis should have gone right here and you should have heard sound effects.
[78:27.72]And the screen should have started to go black.
[78:33.57]And your character should have been going I think this is just like a secret area.
[78:52.91]Make your own game then, poser.
[79:09.59]Alright, there's one more tree apparently somewhere.
[79:18.48]Did I miss a tree over here?
[79:22.81]Yeah, somebody did say pose there.
[79:24.44]They did.
[79:40.54]Yeah, I think that whole area was one gigantic Easter egg.
[79:43.17]It was.
[79:44.33]This is new.
[79:45.15]What's going on here?
[79:48.60]Did I step in the light?
[80:08.43]I had to have missed one area to go to.
[80:10.43]This is day four.
[80:11.05]This is the last day.
[80:13.10]There's gotta be a fourth tree.
[80:16.98]I think the tree broke a fence when it fell down, really.
[80:21.47]Dude.
[80:26.34]You serious?
[80:42.16]Can I go over here?
[80:45.16]Let me check that tree.
[80:54.61]Oh, maybe it did.
[80:55.32]Did it?
[80:55.84]It did break a fence.
[80:59.12]Oh, we got to... We saw all the Easter eggs.
[81:02.98]Okay, we got to see the mosquito.
[81:04.35]We got to see the blinking Scooby-Doo guy.
[81:07.05]This is where the game... This is where I was supposed to go.
[81:11.35]Nice heart rate.
[81:14.34]Yeah, it spiked one time.
[81:17.54]It spiked up to 150.
[81:19.73]It was a glitch, though.
[81:22.17]The software was messed up.
[81:23.11]It was double counting my beats per minute.
[81:25.53]So instead of 70, it was 140.
[81:26.94]And it was a bug that I had in the software, so I had to fix it.
[81:29.98]It hasn't gone up to past 80.
[81:32.72]I'm a fucking Gigachad.
[81:35.37]You know what I mean?
[81:36.03]So of course it's not going to go that high.
[81:57.14]I can't hit it again.
[81:57.94]That was rude.
[82:12.61]Last one, finally.
[82:13.83]I really, really need a break.
[82:34.60]I'm bracing for impact My eyes just got so watery for no reason
[83:22.25]Hey chat.
[83:23.56]Would you do this job?
[83:45.33]Okay.
[83:46.99]We're good?
[83:50.96]Their sense of cooperation is immaculate.
[83:53.08]Thousand brains in unison.
[83:55.85]They are not like us.
[83:56.89]They are better.
[83:59.53]Kind of true.
[84:02.48]Trees can communicate with each other.
[84:03.72]It's crazy.
[84:04.16]Trees can communicate with each other.
[84:06.32]The ground.
[84:13.44]I can't sleep.
[84:14.46]I guess I'll go for a walk.
[84:17.70]Wonderful.
[84:36.42]Where should I go this way?
[85:03.00]Just.
[85:08.63]I think there's someone up there next to the bathrooms.
[85:13.06]Bathroom?
[85:14.76]There are bathrooms out here?
[85:25.42]Hey, it's just a few kids smoking weed.
[85:28.87]It's just some teenagers smoking weed.
[85:36.36]Okay.
[85:38.46]Hello.
[85:39.18]Go on.
[85:39.86]Get out of here.
[85:40.51]This is a weird game.
[86:05.81]Hey, excuse me, a bunch of teenagers in there.
[86:08.83]Like, yeah, why would I hit it with an axe?
[86:11.51]I was trying to knock on the window.
[86:12.85]I was trying to knock on the window.
[86:18.00]You've ruined the vibe?
[86:29.85]What the hell is this?
[86:30.60]What is this?
[86:31.86]Ah!
[86:33.62]Another tree?
[86:34.88]It looks so human.
[86:36.56]They're getting better.
[86:38.08]It's just the trees.
[86:57.32]Huh?
[87:02.89]Why did I do that?
[87:12.61]Their lies are each time more believable.
[87:17.43]It felt extremely real.
[87:23.20]Alright, relax.
[87:23.74]You're getting paranoid.
[87:24.90]Do I think these people are trees?
[87:31.62]It's just the trees, it's just the trees.
[87:33.48]So what was this then?
[87:52.84]Are the trees tricking you into thinking they're people?
[87:55.69]I think it's, I think it's, I think I think that the trees are trees, but they're actually people.
[88:01.88]And I'm just apparently in the game, I'm swinging an axe at people and hitting them.
[88:06.48]But I guess I'm hallucinating.
[88:08.41]It's a hallucination, uh, dairy thing.
[88:11.73]It's a hallucination thing.
[88:18.84]I'm going to get back to the cabin and instead of wood, I'm going to be a shitload of meat.
[88:23.68]It's gonna be a pile of meat.
[88:25.66]Uh, it's gonna be heads.
[88:27.47]You'll see.
[88:29.29]Yeah, classic hallucination bit.
[88:30.74]That's right.
[88:35.55]What was that?
[89:00.34]Yep.
[89:02.95]Alright, let's see it.
[89:12.24]Day six.
[89:14.55]Red upon red.
[89:15.77]To my eyes, it's just bodies piling up.
[89:20.23]How was I supposed to tell the difference?
[89:33.74]Ugh!
[89:36.62]No, no, you're lying!
[89:38.05]They were trees!
[89:42.11]They were all trees!
[89:57.06]Day seven.
[90:00.79]They reshaped my brain, my inner workings.
[90:03.94]Can a plant take away your humanity?
[90:07.70]I was lost in that forest, but then you found me.
[90:24.67]Who found me?
[90:29.41]I really did need a day of rest.
[90:32.96]I don't think I've slept yet.
[90:35.40]Yesterday was horrible.
[90:43.24]I need to walk.
[90:46.55]Should I go to a different place?
[91:00.71]Treasure, treasure, treasure, treasure.
[91:03.00]Oh, you said trees as Christ.
[91:04.78]I thought you said treasure chest.
[91:15.01]Not much blood bark trees over here.
[91:16.66]I could sneak out of the park.
[91:19.56]There might be some outside.
[91:20.74]Alright, let's do it.
[91:31.34]Can I leave this way?
[91:33.20]Wait, the graffiti is still here.
[91:38.17]And halfway done?
[91:39.93]Yeah, what?
[91:40.83]It can't be.
[91:41.25]It's the trees still.
[91:42.33]Am I... Do I realize it?
[91:49.50]I must realize it.
[91:54.33]Okay.
[91:54.67]Okay.
[91:57.46]But this is the last day, so I guess I gotta go to one of the other bots that I was before?
[92:02.13]The way the car left.
[92:09.64]Oh, this way.
[92:21.00]Detour.
[92:21.58]Blood, bark, forest, stay away.
[92:23.28]Detour.
[92:25.80]The park is empty.
[92:26.44]Only the trees are watching.
[92:29.96]Are people scared of them?
[92:31.64]Are they scared of me?
[92:37.97]Shut up.
[92:38.33]Shut up.
[92:42.86]Get out of my head.
[92:43.70]Who am I ta- oh.
[92:49.19]What the fuck?
[92:52.11]It's not true.
[92:52.59]It can't be true.
[92:56.49]I didn't kill anybody.
[93:03.60]They just take me out?
[93:04.44]The police found the suspect wielding an axe due to his sudden and violent movements and screaming.
[93:10.93]He was considered a dangerous threat and was shot to death.
[93:14.06]At his cabin, they found the corpses of two people whose identities are yet unknown.
[93:18.63]Placed next to the lumberjack's chopped wood, the limbs, heads, and torsos of the victims were separated from each other as if they were logs.
[93:25.36]The logging company declared no responsibility for the deaths inciting the victims' entry into the fenced area.
[93:31.09]However, they will face a moderate fine for lack of security.
[93:38.02]Classic hallucination.
[93:39.81]Chop it up, people.
[93:41.15]Trope.
[93:43.39]That was good.
[93:43.87]I liked it.
[93:49.40]Based on the works of... Valdivia?
[93:53.66]Valdivia?
[93:55.34]Is it a short story that was made into a game?
[94:00.11]Something like that?
[94:03.47]Does blood bark?
[94:04.67]Pretty cool.
[94:06.94]Alright, coming up next, we've got a game called Night Bus.
[94:12.10]This one's called Night Bus.
[94:24.55]A night bus.
[94:28.63]Make sure the settings are fine.
[94:31.39]Resolution, that's got to be a little bit higher, right?
[94:33.86]1080 at least.
[94:39.62]Epic graphics, yeah.
[94:45.27]How about audio?
[94:47.71]There's voice acting in this one.
[94:54.85]Turn it up a little bit.
[94:58.52]It might get loud, be aware of that.
[95:00.58]I can't control that.
[95:03.13]But, alright, this is called Night Bus.
[95:07.13]Birds aren't real.
[95:09.87]It is loud.
[95:15.36]Hello there, welcome aboard to your first day at Bust.
[95:20.39]Thanks for filling in so quickly.
[95:21.07]It's been hard finding a place to drive after the first one.
[95:24.23]Oh, it's drop off at the ding.
[95:34.57]Alright, I could change a couple things.
[95:46.02]Alright, don't panic, don't stay still too long, and there's a cuddly kitty on the dash you can pet if you start freaking out too much.
[95:56.18]This one's gold already.
[95:59.76]Let's turn the effects down a little.
[96:03.09]Voice up.
[96:03.91]Music up.
[96:05.33]I think that's probably good.
[96:08.80]We good?
[96:09.12]Alright, let's go.
[96:16.73]We'll pick up passengers.
[96:25.59]Is that a goat?
[96:27.59]Or a sheep?
[96:28.11]What the hell is that?
[96:32.08]Oops.
[96:35.82]Remember to open the door if- Wait, there's a passenger right here.
[96:41.19]Boy, these people are banned.
[96:44.04]Open the door please, young man.
[96:54.17]Stop 661.
[96:55.49]Alright, now sit down and shut up.
[97:17.45]Where is he?
[97:21.17]I broke the TV!
[97:24.28]I got an achievement that says break the TV.
[97:26.49]What?
[97:31.19]Wait, did that guy just run away?
[97:32.66]I'm free.
[97:34.16]Alright.
[97:34.78]Where's the cat?
[97:39.45]What is going on?
[97:40.05]Is the guy behind me?
[97:40.91]He's fucking being a weirdo.
[97:49.63]Alright.
[97:54.94]661?
[97:56.73]It's not you?
[97:57.19]You're the next one?
[98:15.34]Is he gonna come from behind with a knife or something?
[98:20.72]Ah!
[98:24.37]Remember to check your security camera.
[98:26.04]What are you talking about?
[98:26.86]Alright, 661, this is you.
[98:40.64]Alright, get out.
[98:41.98]Thank you for riding.
[98:49.85]Thank you.
[98:50.07]You're welcome.
[99:04.82]Should I be checking the cameras more often?
[99:07.41]Pet Acerola to stay calm.
[99:11.78]Aww.
[99:15.10]That's cute.
[99:35.82]Hey!
[99:37.55]Alright, I got another passenger here.
[99:40.59]You want it?
[99:42.79]Where you going?
[99:53.62]I don't know where she's going.
[99:58.47]What stop?
[99:58.97]What stop are you getting off at?
[100:03.82]Is that person wanted?
[100:05.28]Oh, they're in the back.
[100:05.90]They're in a weird spot.
[100:06.58]Hold on.
[100:07.92]Okay, I'm keeping the camera on this person.
[100:27.81]Ah!
[100:27.89]Hey, don't do that!
[100:46.61]God dammit.
[100:52.86]Yeah.
[100:53.86]Watch out for monsters.
[100:54.76]Are we there yet?
[100:55.34]Nope, not yet.
[101:02.67]Who's making that sound?
[101:03.29]Is that me making that sound?
[101:14.08]Shit.
[101:15.89]Don't press it too much, you can mess it up.
[101:30.67]Wait, no.
[101:30.87]What?
[101:31.85]What's wrong with my bus?
[101:34.72]No, I don't think so.
[101:36.51]No way.
[101:37.33]Not that bus.
[101:38.05]Nuh-uh.
[101:39.23]I might be dumb, but I didn't have to.
[101:40.89]You think I'll get on that bus?
[101:42.85]That bus?
[101:43.27]Okay, anything you say.
[101:44.53]No frickin' way.
[101:46.52]No.
[101:50.02]What are you saying?
[101:55.59]Yeah, that was an Xbox Live microphone.
[101:58.27]That is exactly what that sounded like.
[102:12.96]I'm gonna be fine.
[102:23.76]I get the cat with me.
[102:31.84]The toaster strudels are done.
[102:37.35]What does it say?
[102:40.72]It's not even written and I don't even know what language it's in.
[102:44.35]Oh!
[102:48.08]Yeah, that guy was right.
[103:13.56]Hey, uh, sorry man, but I don't, uh.
[103:20.24]I think that's a guy that's a bad guy.
[103:21.46]I don't know.
[103:22.73]I can't tell.
[103:23.89]What are you doing?
[103:47.29]Okay.
[103:56.02]Ah!
[103:56.46]Where is he?
[104:13.10]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[104:15.24]Okay.
[104:16.72]Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop!
[104:19.01]But... This is stop 666.
[104:32.20]Alright, where are you going?
[104:54.74]Where did he sit?
[105:00.41]Why can I not see him?
[105:00.97]He's in the back, right there.

[108:07.40]I'm going to smash this thing.
[108:08.32]You're right.
[108:08.74]Don't stop.
[108:10.74]Don't stop.
[108:11.36]Don't stop at 666.
[108:15.77]Oh, alright.
[108:16.41]This one's good.
[108:23.65]Can I try it again?
[108:24.73]And just don't stop at 666?
[108:26.96]Just don't stop.
[108:27.60]Should I just not stop at all?
[108:28.51]Don't pick up any passengers at all?
[108:31.19]That sounds kind of interesting.
[108:38.70]Just full send it.
[108:39.36]Don't stop at all.
[108:47.40]Alright.
[108:47.62]I am not going to stop for anybody.
[108:48.87]I'm just going to... I'm going to full send it.
[108:54.27]Hello there.
[108:54.53]Welcome aboard to your first day at Boston.
[108:56.34]Alright, let's go.
[109:08.32]Should I pick up any?
[109:09.24]Just don't stop at 666, pick up everybody else.
[109:15.91]Okay.
[109:20.02]This one's creepy.
[109:27.19]I like it.
[109:29.63]You got it.
[109:36.08]It says don't stop at 666.
[109:37.99]Okay.
[109:42.53]Let's just move.
[109:43.21]Let's go.
[109:48.78]Is he already here?
[109:51.24]He's not already here, is he?
[110:01.73]Alright, 660.
[110:06.80]How's the audio, too?
[110:07.42]Is the audio too loud, or is it fine?
[110:09.03]Are we good?
[110:15.92]Fine?
[110:16.10]It's good?
[110:16.76]Okay.
[110:28.09]Yeah, check this.
[110:29.09]Yeah, we know what happens here.
[110:31.94]He pops up.
[110:35.64]Alright, just don't stop at 666 and just keep driving.
[110:47.78]Completely ignore the ghost dude.
[110:48.94]Just don't even look at him.
[111:05.91]Do I have a calm meter or is it just?
[111:09.55]For fun.
[111:12.06]They're so funny with his hissing at me.
[111:28.87]That's kind of weird.
[111:29.99]That's weird.
[111:30.47]It's not about that strange, right?
[111:34.77]He was hissing at the monster.
[111:37.59]Ah, that's cool.
[111:49.90]He's protecting me.
[111:51.38]He's protecting me.
[112:06.31]Hey, yep.
[112:22.13]We're fine.
[112:22.97]663.
[112:28.68]They say the vibes are trash.
[112:30.26]They don't like the vibes at all.
[112:31.35]I get it.
[112:36.97]The banned list is on your bottom right.
[112:43.58]This is just the developer taking a goofy selfie.
[112:46.28]You know how many of those are on my camera roll right now?
[112:49.07]A hundred.
[112:52.21]There's no- I- I can't- Do you know how many take the picture down here?
[112:57.76]Facing up?
[112:59.36]Doing the big chin with all the rolls underneath you?
[113:10.36]How many people have one of those on their camera roll right now?
[113:14.25]Do you think every single person on Earth has one of those pictures on their camera roll at some point?
[113:19.94]Like one of the first things you do when you get an iPhone.
[113:23.04]You're a liar.
[113:23.62]If you don't have one of these, you're full of shit.
[113:26.42]If you don't have a downward facing camera facing a picture of you being like making a ton of rolls here, you are a liar.
[113:35.70]You're just making it up.
[113:39.64]I don't believe you.
[113:50.05]Maybe in, like, 2011.
[113:51.84]So it's on one of your... It's on one of your devices.
[114:01.02]No way.
[114:01.56]No way.
[114:03.67]No way.
[114:10.64]It really does sound like an Xbox mic.
[114:26.24]I don't take selfies.
[114:31.71]I'm just I'm just saying everybody has.
[114:33.62]Or at least that's normal people.
[114:37.67]Have a selfie where you try to make as many rolls on your neck as possible.
[114:41.64]That is a very normal person behavior.
[114:49.71]And then you send that to the group chat.
[114:52.65]And you get one LOL.
[114:56.88]Or no reply at all.
[114:59.38]That's the best part.
[114:59.86]You get no reply at all.
[115:01.54]And then six or seven days later, somebody just continues a conversation that was happening like three days ago.
[115:06.97]They just keep the conversation just keeps going.
[115:09.97]It's as if you didn't even send it.
[115:23.56]That's a group chat in a nutshell.
[115:25.20]Yeah.
[115:27.96]Alright, don't look at him.
[115:28.98]Don't look.
[115:30.97]I looked.
[115:31.31]Why did I do that?
[115:37.60]Why did I look?
[115:42.49]I couldn't help it.
[115:43.19]I had to.
[115:47.35]Yeah, it's especially embarrassing if you send more than two or three memes in a row.
[115:56.56]If you send more than two or three memes in a row, there's no replies at all.
[116:00.45]And then a day or two later, the conversation keeps going.
[116:08.55]Alright, now false ended.
[116:34.23]Alright, you good?
[116:36.61]Get out.
[116:39.90]What?
[116:40.14]What?
[116:40.50]What?
[116:40.92]What?
[116:41.26]What?
[116:44.60]Is nobody on the bus?
[116:51.57]No one's on the bus.
[116:52.63]I thought somebody was on it.
[116:56.93]Okay, yup.
[116:57.39]I know.
[116:57.67]I know.
[116:57.89]I know.
[116:58.09]I get it.
[116:58.46]I get it.
[116:58.72]I get it.
[116:58.94]I get it.
[116:59.28]I get it.
[116:59.68]I understand.
[117:00.08]I understand.
[117:01.72]I'm just driving through the next one, I think.
[117:12.70]Come on, come on, come on.
[117:15.41]Come on, come on, come on.
[117:16.09]Hurry, go, go, go, go, go.
[117:20.57]Good.
[117:20.69]Okay.
[117:21.01]Good.
[117:21.92]Okay.
[117:22.34]Good.
[117:22.72]Sit down.
[117:26.56]Alright, I'm not stopping for anybody else.
[117:32.87]Good evening, Sam.
[117:39.18]Nope.
[117:39.72]Nope.
[117:39.84]I'm not looking.
[117:45.64]I'm not looking.
[117:46.49]I'm not looking over there.
[117:49.61]He just crawled across the road.
[118:00.15]Oh my God, he's still on.
[118:01.35]He's still to the right of the car.
[118:08.22]He won't leave me alone.
[118:09.12]He's still right here.
[118:18.70]Do I stop and let the guy out?
[118:23.59]Nah, fuck you.
[118:24.19]I don't care.
[118:24.61]We're not stopping.
[118:33.37]I'm not looking behind me either.
[118:57.45]God help you.
[118:58.17]Alright, go.
[118:59.45]Thank you.
[119:15.75]What am I doing?
[119:17.17]I'm getting sucked up.

[120:10.72]Let's try that.
[120:11.35]I'm not picking up a single passenger.
[120:18.92]See you later.
[120:24.24]Open the door please, young man.
[120:31.36]This door is not opening once.
[120:40.59]Oh, this is the panic meter, somebody said.
[120:42.62]Okay.
[120:54.78]We're back.
[120:58.56]Good job.
[121:29.17]Ain't but one man.
[126:03.34]They're good.
[126:08.77]Pretzels.
[126:10.31]It's a pretzel.
[126:12.60]One of the big, chunky ones.
[126:17.46]It's not a dog treat.
[126:25.18]You can't even hear it.
[126:54.89]Okay.
[126:57.00]I think this one's good.
[126:57.86]I'm done with this one.
[126:59.36]We've got a lot to go through, so we're going to move on.
[127:02.13]The next one we're going to do is It Steals.
[127:04.91]The next one is called It Steals.
[127:16.03]This one looks crazy.
[127:19.80]This one actually may be flashing lights and sounds and screaming.
[127:23.77]I don't know.
[127:24.73]We'll give it about 20 minutes.
[127:28.95]Give it a try.
[127:36.12]Yeah, warning.
[127:37.37]It says warning flashing lights.
[127:44.14]Actually warning on the front of the box.
[127:50.56]Turn it up.
[127:53.71]Yeah, so hey, warning flashing lights, here it comes.
[127:57.01]I'm just going.
[127:59.88]Press R to check radar.
[128:03.12]Hold on, let me... It's fine.
[128:14.54]That's fine.
[128:15.40]Let's maybe bring this down so it doesn't explode everybody's ears.
[128:19.95]I will turn it up on my end here, but I'm going to turn it down in the game.
[128:26.42]Pixelization, that's fine.
[128:27.44]Yeah, this is fine.
[128:30.98]You ready?
[128:35.33]Here we go.
[128:37.07]Press R to check radar.
[128:44.21]Uh-huh.
[128:50.88]Did I just get all the globes?
[128:56.54]Thirteen.
[128:57.00]Have I played this before?
[129:12.76]Running is dangerous.
[129:13.70]Don't run.
[129:18.62]The fuck is that?
[130:08.95]What am I scared of?
[130:09.92]There's nothing in here yet.
[130:16.65]It's behind me.
[130:56.88]Okay.
[131:00.74]No survival instincts?
[131:11.27]Alright, we'll get it.
[131:14.46]I don't think I've played this before.
[131:15.98]Maybe something similar.
[131:16.76]Alright, get all the orbs.
[131:19.36]Don't get grabbed.
[131:21.25]Don't run.
[131:21.87]Can I turn the flashlight off?
[131:26.09]Don't say that.
[131:29.75]Apparently this is the same dev as Lethal Company, which is interesting.
[131:33.14]Okay, so let's go right.
[131:44.91]There's a ton over here.
[132:07.37]Did a monster show up on the radar?
[132:31.65]Did we just get a raid from Bloodwig?
[132:34.06]What's up Bloodwig?
[132:37.84]Thanks for the raid.
[132:38.44]Welcome, everybody.
[132:40.91]How's Ludwig doing?
[132:41.99]What's he been up to?
[132:44.13]Hold on.
[132:44.35]Hold that thought.
[132:50.22]What if I don't move?
[132:50.72]Can I not move?
[132:51.34]What if I don't move?
[132:51.92]Would I get in trouble?
[132:59.43]We're doing scary games.
[133:00.45]We're drinking a couple of beers.
[133:04.21]Yeah, welcome.
[133:14.48]Oh my god, it didn't even kill me.
[133:16.60]It ran right by me.
[133:18.09]Like the Roadrunner.
[133:24.18]That scared the shit out of me though.
[133:26.78]Why did it not kill me?
[133:27.64]I was expecting death.
[133:32.75]I was expecting to die.
[133:33.85]Why did it not kill me?
[133:35.68]That's making me more scared than it not killing me.
[134:21.24]I need three more and I win.
[134:27.70]Hey!
[134:34.59]New guide unlocked?
[134:38.30]What do you mean how to play?
[134:43.77]I just almost picked them all up in one go.
[134:45.73]I am screaming by the way.
[134:49.13]You got Luigi mode?
[134:50.23]Wait, you can go here for guidance, which will make the game easier to play.
[134:52.98]Guides will be unlocked for each mode after you die at least two times.
[134:57.55]Oh.
[135:00.13]No.
[135:00.63]Fuck it.
[135:00.91]I get it right now.
[135:01.71]Watch this.
[135:02.76]Hey.
[135:04.12]Power up a little bit.
[135:11.93]Nope.
[135:26.49]Ain't that monster right there?
[135:30.02]Bush mode activated.
[135:55.84]Why does the radar suck?
[135:58.24]Why the radar should- why is it not- Hey, that's rude.
[136:16.36]Bush mode, activate!
[136:53.18]Let's-a go!
[137:08.54]Someone just told me to shut up.
[137:16.13]Yeah, I can't believe I got killed during bush mode, that's true.
[137:20.52]That seems impossible, to die during bush mode.
[137:25.63]OK, this one's scary and it's hard and I'll do it one more time.
[137:44.15]Can somebody?
[137:44.59]Oh.
[137:48.64]Guys.
[137:50.10]I just wasn't letting it load for one second.
[137:54.94]I thought the radar didn't work, but you have to let it load.
[137:58.09]This game is very interesting.
[138:05.52]Alright.
[138:09.49]To the right.
[138:24.57]I'm gonna shut up and just play it.
[138:26.46]I'm gonna beat it.
[138:33.29]Flash it.
[138:34.29]I keep a power.
[138:37.82]Just look at it?
[138:42.35]There's three over here.
[138:57.94]Now how many of you guys ever got eight pages in Slenderman?
[139:00.82]I always got to four and then would kick a hole through my monitor.
[139:25.95]How do you guys feel about public pools?
[139:28.41]How do you guys feel about pools in general?
[139:31.26]Here's the thing.
[139:32.80]I was thinking about this the other day.
[139:36.76]If I ever have a pool, you're signing a document that you're clean.
[139:42.71]I don't like the idea of a public pool.
[139:47.02]You know how many people just don't actually fully wipe their ass?
[139:51.89]The amount of people that don't wipe their ass fully.
[139:55.37]I don't want to get in a pool with you.
[139:59.66]If I have a pool, you're signing a document that says that you have wiped your ass in the last six hours.
[140:16.65]That's based and reasonable?
[140:21.35]No, I'm just saying.
[140:22.69]I'm just saying.
[140:23.15]I don't want to get into water with... Think of how gross people are.
[140:29.20]And think of the grosser people that would be in that public pool, potentially.
[140:35.01]No, I don't do public pools.
[140:50.10]How would you prove that they lied?
[140:53.57]I don't know.
[140:54.13]But there would be a whole vetting process if you were going to get into my pool.
[141:12.23]Oh, somebody doesn't like getting little legs.
[141:14.67]I'm not scared of that anymore.
[141:16.35]I am not scared of that anymore.
[141:18.55]I just had to see what it was, and it's... I'm not scared of it anymore.
[141:22.58]I actually think it's kind of funny.
[141:36.55]Hey!
[141:36.87]Oh, hi.
[141:39.88]Hey.
[141:41.57]Chicken jockey.
[142:11.47]I don't have it anymore.
[142:13.04]I don't have it anymore.
[142:17.52]I don't think I have it anymore.
[142:34.82]How do I get over here?
[142:49.19]Hey, hey, hey.
[142:50.43]Shine the light on his face.
[142:51.47]Shine the light on him.
[142:52.03]Get over here.
[142:55.20]What?
[142:55.46]Don't tell me to run.
[142:56.76]I thought you said don't run.
[143:09.34]When do I fucking lose him?
[143:12.32]I lost him.
[143:29.62]There's only two more in the whole level.
[143:30.92]Two hundred?
[143:33.61]What do you mean, two hundred?
[143:34.85]Bro?
[143:48.76]You good?
[143:51.33]Bro?
[143:53.51]Bro?
[143:57.97]Bro?
[144:03.59]You alright?
[144:06.01]Hey, no, don't get in the pool.
[144:09.98]I don't want you getting in that pool.
[144:23.15]Yeah, I would have a shower.
[144:24.61]That was it.
[144:25.45]We're talking about if I had a hundred million dollars.
[144:27.63]I'm gonna have a really nice pool.
[144:29.48]And I'm gonna have a shower next to the pool.
[144:32.26]There's gonna be instructions before you you you have to actually put a password in The password to get into my pool is gonna be you have to read all the instructions and it's the passwords in the instructions So I need to know you've actually read the whole thing You're taking you're gonna take a full shower There's gonna be an ass wiping station where you get you know, it's completely private and you wipe your ass And you have to go one two three before you get in the pool
[145:04.97]No!
[145:06.67]No!
[145:07.99]Give it to me, it's right there!
[145:11.16]That's not the game.
[145:16.97]That was level one.
[145:22.26]Yeah, okay, so phase one, the first thing is a shower.
[145:25.64]You take a full shower with soap and everything.
[145:28.84]Step two is the ass wiping station.
[145:30.99]You have to wipe your ass.
[145:31.89]If you're not getting in my pool without... Unless you go in there.
[145:33.81]I don't care.
[145:34.45]You can fake it.
[145:35.07]I don't care.
[145:36.91]Three is the breath station.
[145:39.68]There's six different breath sprays.
[145:42.48]There's mint.
[145:43.38]There's strawberry.
[145:43.98]There's banana.
[145:44.94]There's spearmint.
[145:45.72]And you... Into your mouth.
[145:49.03]Then you come out.
[145:50.17]You're going to get your... The station four is powder your hands.
[145:53.07]Just lightly powdering.
[145:55.30]Then you can get in my fucking pool.
[145:59.91]There was no way out.
[146:05.08]There's only... ...further in.
[146:26.19]Wait.
[146:27.21]I did beat it.
[146:31.23]You need to fix your compressor.
[146:32.43]Is my compressor squishing down by screaming?
[146:44.31]Okay.
[146:44.43]Shutter mode.
[146:45.21]What is shutter mode?
[146:56.39]Don't run out of battery.
[147:01.99]Oh God, that's scary.
[147:09.06]Only eight in this one, okay.
[147:24.66]Ooh, you see that flick?
[147:26.44]Hit me on a Counter-Strike team.
[147:29.42]Just swear at the other teams and not play.
[147:46.54]are you talking about?
[147:47.59]I'm done.
[147:55.55]Hey, you ever heard of Withering Rooms?
[147:59.52]That was my game of the year last year.
[148:00.92]That's one of the best games I've ever played.
[148:03.72]I love that game.
[148:04.62]Yeah, I've heard of it.
[148:10.17]Alright, next one.
[148:14.23]What is up next?
[148:17.21]Oh, this is going to slow it down.
[148:18.73]I don't think this is particularly scary, but it's supposed to be kind of cool.
[148:23.21]It's called The Children of Clay.
[148:31.16]The Children of Clay.
[148:37.61]This one's cool.
[148:38.51]Cool.
[148:41.05]Apparently the whole thing's made out of claymation.
[148:42.75]I think the volume's good.
[148:50.13]This is more... I don't think there's extreme jump scares in this one.
[148:54.05]Time is 5 and 40 past 11.
[148:55.36]I've received another artifact from my old friend, Professor Ortvei.
[148:59.36]He writes again about how he misses working with me out in the field.
[149:02.49]And his remorse about the accident.
[149:04.99]I immediately felt a chill down my spine and was once again back in the cave.
[149:08.71]Wrapped.
[149:09.86]And hopeless.
[149:13.82]I compose myself.
[149:14.50]I need to focus on my work.
[149:16.38]Time to start the examination.
[149:24.50]Artifact NR297.
[149:25.77]Sight.
[149:26.93]Bergen Burial Mound.
[149:27.85]7B.
[149:28.75]Earl Mountains.
[149:29.83]Material clay.
[149:30.75]Age unknown.
[149:32.03]Function unknown.
[149:38.86]You're going to play another Nancy Drew game?
[149:41.61]I showed them to my mom and she loves them.
[149:44.65]The games or the streams?
[149:46.86]Because the Nancy Drew games are great.
[149:52.76]Weird.
[149:53.69]Okay.
[149:59.59]search for.
[150:00.35]This feature resembles a human face.
[150:10.20]What does this do?
[150:24.83]Whoa, okay.
[150:32.81]Creepy.
[150:44.00]Oh, they seem to have some sort of runes.
[150:46.51]I don't recognize the type.
[150:48.79]I'm talking to my book.
[150:56.68]Runes?
[150:59.97]An example of the rune and runiform writings, the letter U written using different runes.
[151:05.77]Orcan Rovis Futark.
[151:17.00]Okay.
[151:17.14]What's that?
[151:20.09]Looks like a metal object embedded in the artifact.
[151:23.63]Doesn't seem like it's possible to extract it.
[151:25.49]Maybe I can find out what kind of metal it is.
[151:37.66]I love this shit.
[151:39.25]I love this clay stuff.
[151:42.77]Sometimes I just... I'm not going to read that one, but ban that person for an hour.
[151:55.13]Okay.
[151:57.20]What is this for?
[151:59.94]Metal?
[152:01.12]Metal?
[152:02.81]The earliest archaeological support of smelting is dated to around 6000-5000 BC.
[152:08.83]The most common metals found on archaeology sites are iron, copper, lead, tin, zinc, and their alloys.
[152:15.40]Because iron is magnetic, it can be easily distinguished from the rest.
[152:20.36]Is this magnetic?
[152:25.49]Ah!
[152:26.11]Magnetic.
[152:27.05]Iron.
[152:31.69]Okay, so it's iron.
[152:43.31]What does that do?
[152:47.67]Alright, it's got runes.
[152:48.81]It's got iron.
[152:49.78]What about, like, clay?
[152:52.66]Pottery is the process of forming objects with clay and other raw materials, which are fired at high temperatures to give them hard and durable form.
[152:59.57]It is one of the oldest human inventions originating before the Neolithic period, with ceramic objects depicted 29,000 BC.
[153:05.85]Okay.
[153:06.41]So I gotta search for everything.
[153:12.76]Okay.
[153:14.90]Maybe, like, face?
[153:17.54]Not finding anything... Okay, not about face.
[153:26.41]We got the ruins written down.
[153:30.80]Can I extract it?
[153:35.38]It reacts to this.
[153:42.83]Earliest known ironwork is dated from 3500 BC and made from meteoric iron.
[153:49.07]Okay, this is wrought and cast iron.
[153:55.44]Okay.
[153:59.04]Yeah, meteor?
[154:10.98]What the fuck was that?
[154:15.46]Why?
[154:25.30]It said I could extract it if I knew what metal it was.
[154:27.84]How do I extract it?
[154:41.94]What about symbols?
[154:42.78]Somebody said symbols?
[154:43.90]No.
[154:46.07]Rune.
[154:47.50]Yeah, one, two, three.
[154:48.60]Okay, wait.
[154:49.80]Wait.
[154:51.74]Hold on.
[154:53.40]Rovis?
[154:54.14]The two is down there.
[154:55.07]Rovis.
[154:55.85]What if I say Rovis?
[154:58.23]The Rovis script or old Hungarian runes is a writing system used for writing the Hungarian language.
[155:03.62]Ah, okay.
[155:03.96]So this is... Look with your fucking eyes.
[155:09.47]Look.
[155:14.09]Is it L?
[155:14.65]No.
[155:18.17]No, it's G. G?
[155:20.45]N?
[155:25.66]U?
[155:30.84]D?
[155:32.73]G-N-U-D?
[155:33.87]I'm looking for that one.
[155:41.38]R?
[155:41.52]G-N-U-D-R?
[155:45.56]G-N-U-D-R-U?
[155:53.49]New Drew?
[155:57.17]New Drew?
[156:08.28]Did I get it wrong?
[156:11.23]That it's written to the left.
[156:17.97]Oh, wait, wait.
[156:18.41]Yeah, that's correct.
[156:22.67]What the hell was it called again?
[156:23.89]It was Rovis.
[156:30.59]Oh, left to right.
[156:33.88]So it would be... Left to right, that's correct.
[156:43.17]So, what does that mean?
[156:44.69]Look with your eyes?
[156:45.59]He actually can't read.
[156:46.39]What are you talking about?
[156:49.13]Written from...
[156:51.51]I... I'm sorry.
[156:52.63]Okay, right to left.
[156:53.65]Shut up.
[156:54.83]Stop.
[156:55.49]Relax.
[156:56.67]So that's... G... What did I say?
[156:59.15]Nudru?
[157:01.58]That would be... Urdang.
[157:11.39]Urdang is a shape-shifting demonic creature.
[157:13.31]I figured that out on my own.
[157:14.93]From early Hungarian paganism and pre-Christian beliefs, it ruled the lower world and helped God in creating the Earth.
[157:21.17]After Christianization, he was identified with the devil.
[157:25.26]One of the oldest Erdung mists is recorded on the Ugru tablet found in the Earl Mountains.
[157:32.03]Illustration of the devil.
[157:34.21]Cool.
[157:36.12]Okay.
[157:38.10]Uh, Ugru.
[157:41.39]Ugru?
[157:46.03]legend of the star that fell to Earth and out of the star the seven children of Erdung crawled out.
[157:51.84]According to the legends, the children caused misfortune, sickness, and death to mankind, but a brave Taltosh used his cunning to lure and trap the creatures.
[158:02.66]Of the seven children, only six are depicted on the tablet,
[158:06.18]This could be because of damage, but one hypothesis states that this is an evidence for the seventh children being the full creature Mumush.
[158:12.52]Take a picture quick.
[158:13.83]Take a picture quick.
[158:14.85]Get all the, get all the rolls.
[158:17.15]I'm trying to burp.
[158:18.59]Okay, Mumush?
[158:24.90]The Mumush is an invisible creature that scares children in Hungarian folklore.
[158:30.45]Most often associated with darkness.
[158:32.54]Creepy.
[158:33.64]Some sort of dark liquid is flowing out of the holes.
[159:01.65]Liquid.
[159:10.14]Oil?
[159:12.18]Can I light it on fire?
[159:14.92]Hey.
[159:19.75]Now you're being weird.
[159:27.92]Crying.
[159:31.24]What was the last thing?
[159:31.97]Hold on.
[159:33.23]What was the last thing I wrote?
[159:37.46]What was the last thing?
[159:43.13]Oh, the dark liquid loosened the metal object.
[159:51.12]It needs to be a nail.
[159:55.43]Uh-oh.
[160:07.15]I should pick up the candle and investigate.
[160:18.93]The hell am I doing?
[160:31.22]Why am I holding a candle?
[160:42.98]That is a highly scary, toxic statue.
[161:02.12]Collection of Neolithic artifacts.
[161:05.99]More dark stains, they lead to the left.
[161:09.41]Lead to the left.
[161:21.71]What is breathing?
[161:23.67]A stone statue from... What is that noise?
[161:39.39]I stumble in the darkness trying to find my way towards the door and away from that wretched thing.
[161:44.71]I reach out with my hand to find something.
[161:47.50]There is a wall here.
[161:53.57]There's a wall here.
[161:55.49]There's a wall here.
[161:59.42]There's nothing in front of me.
[162:03.05]The air feels colder here.
[162:06.13]There's a wall here and I feel some sort of moss growing on it.
[162:11.26]Wall.
[162:12.92]Nothing in front of me.
[162:15.15]Wall.
[162:15.27]Wall.
[162:18.51]moss wall wall nothing wall moss wall nothing wall wall nothing wall wall nothing wall wall nothing wall what am I going in circles what am I doing
[162:55.25]Is this not where I came from?
[163:01.13]Am I losing my mind?
[163:02.30]There's a wall.
[163:06.54]There's a wall.
[163:07.56]There's a wall.
[163:09.21]This can't be happening.
[163:12.87]I remember the matches I keep in my pocket.
[163:14.65]There's just a single one left.
[163:16.78]It takes a few seconds before I dare to light it.
[163:28.88]trapped in here there's nothing here I'm actually trapped in here from the newspaper article titled the children of clay just a few months after the disappearance of the esteemed archaeologist and the incident involving a broken artifact
[163:53.30]That's the end.
[163:54.78]I like that a lot.
[164:03.19]By the way, this game was free.
[164:22.66]Completely free on Steam.
[164:25.48]Totally free.
[164:28.37]That was great.
[164:29.29]I like that a lot.
[164:35.10]Did you become a clay guy or what?
[164:42.93]Made for Cosmic Horrors Jam 3 in 2024.
[164:49.11]That was creepy.
[164:49.59]I like it.
[164:52.38]Okay.
[164:52.50]Okay.
[164:54.18]Uh, what products do I use in my hair?
[164:58.81]I use Maui shampoo and conditioner.
[165:01.75]I used to use Lush, but I stopped doing that.
[165:06.74]The Making of.
[165:09.50]Oh, that's cool.
[165:10.72]That was a good one.
[165:11.76]Children of Clay.
[165:14.87]Uh, next up.
[165:16.21]Let me see what else we got here.
[165:21.42]Oh, I want to try this.
[165:22.06]This game's called Egg Fried Rice.
[165:25.59]I want to try this one.
[165:29.03]Egg fried rice.
[165:39.61]I just got memories of when I was five.
[165:43.04]I actually remember a lot of stuff now.
[165:47.35]Should we keep all the effects and everything or no?
[166:05.93]30 FPS?
[166:14.40]No?
[166:15.41]But it's probably used for aesthetic purposes.
[166:21.12]Just try it and see.
[166:32.72]Okay.
[166:34.98]I can't afford a carriage.
[166:38.20]You look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two.
[166:49.46]I can't afford a carriage.
[166:52.05]They'll teach us this.
[167:08.38]You were 12 when this game came out?
[167:11.37]Uh, no.
[167:17.22]It's no good.
[167:23.64]I'm far too hungry.
[167:25.53]I'm never going to get to sleep.
[167:27.59]I better see what I've got to eat.
[167:31.31]Egg fried rice?
[167:32.86]Look for food.
[167:36.14]Oh, this FOV is gonna... I'm already terrified of this FOV already.
[167:51.10]I like the look of this one.
[168:03.38]Call friend.
[168:13.48]Yeah, who is it?
[168:14.78]It's me.
[168:16.14]It's a bit late for a chat, ain't it?
[168:18.35]I can't sleep.
[168:20.01]So you're calling me in the middle of the night?
[168:22.63]I could have been fast asleep.
[168:24.83]Were you?
[168:26.06]No, of course not.
[168:27.32]I was just heading out.
[168:28.80]Gonna go visit a friend.
[168:29.82]I can't talk now.
[168:31.99]At this time of night?
[168:33.63]Hope this isn't going to be a repeat of last time.
[168:36.35]What?
[168:36.60]No.
[168:37.52]I told you I'm never messing with that stuff again.
[168:39.82]I nearly died that night.
[168:42.77]And then you practically went into hiding.
[168:45.71]I'm not in hiding.
[168:46.35]It was just time for a move.
[168:48.45]Yeah, we're having a pretty deep conversation right now.
[168:51.32]Yeah, convenient timing.
[168:52.36]I don't need this right now.
[168:54.56]Well, lucky you.
[168:55.19]I gotta go.
[168:55.73]This has been Swell.
[168:57.21]Bye-bye.
[168:58.60]Wait!
[168:59.56]Haven't you got any advice on how to fall asleep for me?
[169:04.04]Count sheep.
[169:12.45]Well, let's get food.
[169:21.80]Bridge is empty.
[169:22.43]I got no- I got no food.
[169:24.99]No milk?
[169:35.62]The bread is expired.
[169:39.33]Can opener's broken.
[169:40.35]No canned food.
[169:41.27]I can't eat.
[169:41.73]There's no food.
[169:42.23]I got nothing.
[169:47.69]Ooh.
[169:50.06]Hmm.
[169:50.80]Chinese takeaway.
[169:52.86]That could be... That sounds awesome.
[169:55.34]That sounds actually so good right now.
[169:57.92]It all sounds so good.
[169:58.96]It's late though.
[169:59.86]I shouldn't have much.
[170:01.95]I think I'll just get some egg fried rice.
[170:06.03]Darn, they don't deliver.
[170:06.95]It's only a short drive into town.
[170:10.40]I'll just go and order in person.
[170:13.24]Okay.
[170:26.90]This will help in the dark.
[170:31.33]Succulent Chinese meal.
[170:33.21]Drink.
[170:38.28]OK, so where is it?
[170:40.44]To drive?
[170:44.73]I have to drive the car.
[170:55.91]That's plus one letter grade it is, yeah.
[170:58.19]That's a full, that's a full letter grade.
[171:08.89]Am I even going the right way?
[171:09.97]I didn't get directions.
[171:32.13]Welcome to Waffleton.
[171:34.54]Oh no, here it is.
[171:37.94]Alright, we got.
[171:44.23]How do you park the car?
[171:49.17]Do I actually have to parallel park for real?
[171:52.12]I can't do that.
[171:56.56]Hey.
[172:05.85]Chinese restaurant.
[172:10.32]Open Monday to Friday 14 to 1 30.
[172:16.68]Oh, this is so... Look at how... It's so dreamlike.
[172:22.26]It's so weird.
[172:30.20]I like it.
[172:33.36]Hello, what can I get you?
[172:35.02]Uh, one egg fried rice.
[172:36.34]Of course.
[172:37.68]That'll be $2.80, please.
[172:40.44]Oh no, I forgot my money.
[172:41.50]I'll quickly drive back and get it.
[172:44.70]Is that okay?
[172:46.21]Yes, that's fine.
[172:47.29]Your food will take a few minutes to prepare.
[172:49.97]So it should be ready by the time you come back.
[172:53.04]Do not take too long.
[172:53.82]We must close soon.
[172:55.86]Okay, I'll be right back.
[173:18.79]I don't like that guy.
[173:21.20]I don't like that guy.
[173:39.57]Okay, I gotta get my money.
[173:46.16]Good three-point turn.
[173:49.66]Oh, I'm being a weirdo.
[173:50.82]What am I doing?
[173:55.60]Can you even drive?
[173:56.50]I've had my license for about 30 years.
[174:00.77]No.
[174:01.95]I got it when I was 17.
[174:02.57]20 years.
[174:07.79]I've been driving a car for 21 years.
[174:11.76]I probably have 100,000 miles in a car.
[174:16.54]At least like 50 to 100,000.
[174:27.95]Yeah, sorry, sorry.
[174:29.47]W-A-D, W-A-D, space, W-A, that's not driving a real car.
[174:43.05]Okay, what?
[174:52.10]I'm incredibly safe behind the wheel.
[175:01.19]Alright, where's my money?
[175:06.60]There are coins inside.
[175:07.70]Alright, how much money is in there?
[175:09.99]Okay, that'll cover the egg fried rice with a coin or two to spare.
[175:12.81]I already feel so claustrophobic playing this.
[175:21.74]Is that weird?
[175:24.17]Is that guy going to be here?
[175:32.66]I don't like the vibe of that guy He was staring at me
[175:58.74]Yeah, yeah, I told you that guy was a weird guy.
[176:01.10]I told you that was a weird and what a Looney Tunes way to do that.
[176:15.44]That was the Wile E. Coyote looking to see the Roadrunner coming.
[176:21.25]That's the second Roadrunner reference.
[176:32.42]How am I not parked?
[176:37.64]I am absolutely parked!
[176:45.93]Who's this guy?
[176:49.14]Vibrant man.
[176:51.24]Hey!
[176:51.80]I got a favor to ask you, you know?
[176:54.92]I need a few pennies for the bus.
[176:57.25]Friends help each other out.
[176:59.35]Right friend?
[177:02.61]Uh... I have enough, right?
[177:13.58]They closed?
[177:35.21]Something wrong?
[177:37.35]Of course not.
[177:37.97]I'm back with the money.
[177:39.96]What do you mean?
[177:40.48]I came in for my egg fried rice, remember?
[177:44.40]Did your friend not tell you?
[177:46.27]He paid for your egg fried rice.
[177:49.31]My friend?
[177:51.19]Yes, that man that came in with you before.
[177:53.68]He paid up and said he would take your egg fried rice straight to you.
[177:59.17]He's no friend of mine.
[178:00.81]You let him take my food?
[178:03.41]What a loser.
[178:07.85]Sorry for the mix-up.
[178:11.30]That's okay.
[178:23.43]There's no harm.
[178:33.77]Don't forget to pick up your egg fried rice before you leave.
[178:36.55]Good night.
[178:40.00]Looks delicious.
[178:41.68]Does look good.
[178:57.88]Oh, this is so scary.
[178:58.74]This is such a creepy feeling.
[179:01.24]My friend's still here?
[179:05.78]Man, I don't even know if the bus runs this late.
[179:19.63]Do you want to hang out for a little bit?
[179:21.22]Just come hang out and bring a weapon?
[179:33.81]I got a big order of egg fried rice.
[179:36.66]I can drop you off wherever, but... We can just eat fried rice and you can just make sure that this fucking weirdo doesn't get us.
[180:00.91]Uh, by the way, this is a run the guy over first, ask questions much later.
[180:12.18]Oh fuck that dude, I'm driving.
[180:14.08]I'm doing the Ace Ventura out the window.
[180:16.33]I'm putting my head out the window and I'm driving.
[180:26.84]Is that egg fried rice?
[180:28.98]I don't believe it.
[180:30.26]What a mess.
[180:30.86]Did somebody throw this at me?
[180:33.08]I'm getting creeped out.
[180:34.84]I don't want to hang around here.
[180:37.53]Drive slow and get home.
[180:40.01]I'll sort this out in the morning.
[180:40.92]I can't deal with it now.
[180:42.33]I just want to eat my egg fried rice.
[181:10.33]Remember, I have the ultimate weapon right now.
[181:13.34]I'm in a car.
[181:16.80]I have a weapon.
[181:17.82]I have an ultimate weapon.
[181:19.30]I could just drive into this guy.
[181:21.26]I'm in a car.
[181:29.65]He's going to be in the fucking house.
[181:37.36]See, this is me.
[181:38.74]This shit's in real life.
[181:41.42]Right here, I'm pulling up to my house.
[181:44.56]And I am going, putting the car in neutral.
[181:47.72]And I'm going to step on the gas.
[181:52.17]Yeah.
[182:02.66]And then I'm going to lean out the window.
[182:04.24]I'm going to go.
[182:04.58]Can you even hear this?
[182:07.89]I'm going to go...
[182:09.80]I'm going to make it with my mouth.
[182:11.38]Even if I don't have a gun.
[182:14.01]I'm going to go... It's not even picking up.
[182:16.57]My compressor's fucked up.
[182:18.57]I'm going to make a fucking loading sound with my mouth.
[182:22.86]And I'm going to be saying... One... Two... Just going to make sure I have it.
[182:27.61]One... Oh my god!
[182:29.25]The ads just started!
[182:35.04]I didn't even realize.
[182:36.30]I was too locked in.
[182:37.18]The ads just started.
[182:43.38]Okay.
[182:44.66]Uh, we can hang out for a minute.
[182:47.35]We know what's going to happen when I go in here.
[182:53.85]What I was going to say is I was going to say I'm going to yell out the window.
[183:00.02]Oh, yeah.
[183:00.64]One.
[183:01.86]Two.
[183:03.33]Three.
[183:03.77]Oh, no.
[183:04.13]There's the fourth one.
[183:05.31]Oh, yeah.
[183:05.71]Five grenades.
[183:07.37]I got five grenades.
[183:08.63]Oh, there's six down there.
[183:11.48]Six.
[183:13.96]I'm gonna pretend like I'm counting grenades in my car.
[183:26.31]Direct the conversation over, we just got back.
[183:32.97]That's very scary and intimidating.
[183:38.34]Why not just park in the house?
[183:41.44]Or I might just start holding the horn down.
[183:43.51]Or start playing songs.
[183:45.75]You know, do like Super Mario, like... Yeah, and then call the police, of course.
[184:12.92]What kind of nut doesn't want to go in his own house?
[184:15.50]There is a scary guy that's in the house right now.
[184:19.59]He just threw an egg fried rice at my car.
[184:26.87]Then I get out of the car.
[184:29.18]And I have like one of those like... One of those... Pawns.
[184:33.68]I just keep throwing it out.
[184:35.42]Elongating it.
[184:36.96]And then shorting it out.
[184:37.72]And then elongating it.
[184:39.12]Just so in case he's looking out the window, he's like, what the... Oh, fuck.
[184:42.82]He's doing the fucking elongating baton thing.
[184:54.06]Bro, you're running on 2G?
[185:03.72]What do you mean 2G?
[185:13.38]What if the guy in the house has a Glock?
[185:22.62]Yeah.
[185:25.66]Hey, welcome back.
[185:27.77]Alright, so you didn't miss anything interesting.
[185:31.41]All I said was I was going to be counting my grenades.
[185:36.24]So let's go.
[185:43.91]Welcome back.
[185:44.85]Let's go see what the hell's gonna happen now.
[186:01.95]If I'd start laughing, I'd be like... Out weird the weirdo.
[186:11.10]That's all I'm saying.
[186:19.31]And then talk about how I'm covered in poop.
[186:21.22]Like, oh man, I shit myself.
[186:22.90]I'm covered in shit right now.
[186:24.06]I have this shit all over my body.
[186:39.06]Somebody just threw an egg fried rice in my car.
[186:45.89]What's your emergency?
[186:47.23]Somebody threw some egg fried rice at my car.
[186:50.76]Excuse me?
[186:52.00]Egg fried rice.
[186:53.26]At my car.
[186:55.48]Is this some kind of a joke?
[186:57.63]What?
[186:57.95]No, it smashed up my car.
[187:00.05]I could have been killed.
[187:02.19]Are you still at the scene of the incident?
[187:04.37]No, I drove home to eat my egg fried rice.
[187:08.22]Peace use of an emergency line.
[187:09.56]$100 fine.
[187:10.04]Okay, please don't wait.
[187:16.35]So much for that.
[187:16.95]Hello?
[187:35.44]Hello, it's the Chinese takeaway.
[187:37.04]We have a free bottle of beer for you, a free fortune cookie too.
[187:41.20]Please come and collect them.
[187:44.30]Is this because of the mix-up?
[187:46.52]Yes, that's right.
[187:47.70]Please come and collect them.
[187:51.82]Hello?
[187:56.13]That's pretty sus.
[188:01.07]I could quickly go and pick up that free beer and fortune cookie.
[188:03.50]My egg fried rice would stay warm if I hurry.
[188:07.24]But should I?
[188:15.65]no no way they were closing right next to the big ass window don't even
[188:49.59]Damn.
[188:56.08]After finishing your egg fried rice, you went back to bed.
[188:57.94]As soon as your head hit the pillow, you fell into a deep, peaceful sleep.
[189:00.95]However, the next morning, you woke feeling haunted by your decision to turn down a free drink and fortune cookie due to a little fear and uneasiness.
[189:09.06]The memory of this seemingly poor choice caused you to live the rest of your life with an unshakable sensation of hollowness.
[189:15.81]The mental hangup of ruining an otherwise nice meal meant you could never again fully enjoy the once delicious taste of egg fried rice.
[189:24.76]Somebody tried to kill me on the car ride home.
[189:31.51]Someone tried to kill me.
[189:37.48]Bonus speed is available.
[189:44.65]Alright, well, let's do the other one.
[189:52.16]What's the other ending?
[189:52.94]It's no good.
[189:53.50]I gotta eat.
[189:54.92]Yep, I'm hungry.
[190:07.91]Oh, I am fast.
[190:08.80]Holy shit.
[190:13.44]Okay, I got nothing.
[190:14.12]There's nothing.
[190:14.52]There's nothing.
[190:14.92]There's nothing.
[190:15.32]Here comes the takeaway thing.
[190:16.50]It's gonna fly over here.
[190:19.55]No food.
[190:20.11]Bread's expired.
[190:21.93]Oh, what's that?
[190:27.73]Okay, it'll be tasty.
[190:30.69]Let's get it.
[190:37.10]So the car drives faster too?
[190:39.46]Oh wait.
[190:49.13]How fast does the car go?
[190:58.51]Going a lot faster.
[191:00.26]Oh, the money.
[191:39.89]You gotta go through the whole sequence.
[191:42.04]It's not gonna work.
[192:07.90]You've changed.
[192:08.46]I love the grungy gamer look.
[192:11.72]Grungy?
[192:13.49]I'll have you know I'm incredibly clean.
[192:17.59]The amount of oils and scents.
[192:22.70]The amount of pampering that gets done.
[192:25.26]Grungy?
[192:26.76]How dare you?
[192:27.92]How dare you?
[192:29.02]Ban that person for like an hour.
[192:31.71]Grungy.
[192:33.57]Disgusting.
[192:40.44]Alright, uh, egg fried rice.
[192:42.44]Sounds good.
[192:43.72]Go get your money.
[192:47.87]What the fuck did I just... That scared the shit out of me.
[193:02.75]I feel like my eyes just crossed.
[193:04.02]Did my eyes cross?
[193:10.34]Can somebody go back and get a clip of that?
[193:13.01]Did my eyes cross?
[193:16.14]I think they went like this.
[193:43.82]There's no car damage.
[193:44.74]Who cares?
[193:57.61]Okay.
[194:14.62]Should I give the guy the money for the bus?
[194:17.48]What did that even do?
[194:18.24]I feel like that didn't do anything.
[194:21.35]Maybe I should.
[194:21.95]Yeah, it'd be nice, yeah.
[194:29.88]I imagine he probably helps you, but maybe he saves you?
[194:33.29]Maybe he comes out and fights?
[194:46.26]What's up, dude?
[194:54.44]One, two, three, four, five grenades.
[195:17.54]These brakes are terrible.
[195:31.12]Alright, creepy guy.
[195:32.06]I'll give you a few coins.
[195:33.95]Yep.
[195:36.59]There you go.
[195:41.08]Okay.
[195:41.98]So let's do it.
[195:46.72]Thank you so much.
[195:47.72]I will love another fried rice.
[195:49.04]That guy was a weirdo.
[195:54.98]So what happens if I drive really slow?
[195:57.51]Will he still hit me with it?
[195:59.07]What if I drive really fast?
[196:19.59]Just drive in reverse?
[196:21.93]That's not a bad idea.
[196:44.76]This is gonna be hard.
[196:52.75]I can't look behind me.
[197:11.28]Not as easy as you think.
[197:14.16]...
[197:25.98]The music is not helping.
[198:00.30]shit it's gonna happen again so
[198:32.87]Wait, what?
[198:33.49]He was over here!
[198:34.31]There's no way you know where I'm... You would have had to have known I was driving backwards.
[198:49.24]You had to have known I was driving backwards.
[199:03.33]Let's go.
[199:38.63]Okay.
[199:40.23]So what happens if I leave?
[199:47.64]Here we go.
[199:51.69]Okay, free.
[199:53.83]Please come collect them.
[199:57.26]Okay.
[200:06.33]Go and collect your free stuff.
[200:08.75]This is too good to miss.
[200:09.89]I shouldn't drive the car with the damage?
[200:29.32]I'm gonna walk?
[200:58.75]Huh?
[201:13.64]Okay, I'm restricted.
[201:14.62]I can't go anywhere.
[201:27.27]Why would I walk this way?
[201:28.78]Okay, dude.
[201:48.22]Is he singing the song?
[201:57.77]Okay, what if I go back into the house?
[202:26.27]Why can he go in my door?
[202:40.25]Okay, let's read this.
[202:42.07]Oh, you kept a watchful eye on the strange man and he didn't like it.
[202:45.74]After killing you, he peeled your face off and wore it as a mask.
[202:49.83]He lived out the rest of his life posing as you.
[202:59.11]No, the laughing was not me.
[203:01.89]Your friends and... Although it could have been.
[203:05.64]I covered my face with my hands.
[203:14.33]So it could have been me laughing.
[203:17.21]Anybody got a clip?
[203:18.47]I need to watch that.
[203:23.04]That could have been me laughing.
[203:44.72]I don't think it's going to come through.
[203:46.32]Hold on a second.
[203:50.85]I have a new audio setup.
[203:51.95]Hold on.
[203:59.08]I think I can just delete this.
[204:03.14]Yeah, I can.
[204:03.56]Okay.
[204:16.68]Am I laughing here?
[204:24.07]No.
[204:24.15]Why can't he go in my door?
[204:26.24]Dude, I gotta turn my compressor down.
[204:29.86]You didn't think I was laughing?
[204:31.06]That was very clearly not even me.
[204:34.35]My compressor is fucked up.
[204:35.73]Look at this.
[204:47.29]It sounds like every time I scream, I go underwater for a half a second.
[204:55.69]That's so funny.
[204:59.65]Why are you getting on my door?
[205:12.17]It's like...
[205:16.13]Okay, uh, he eats the fried rice, alright.
[205:26.13]I'll turn it off for now.
[205:30.10]No compressor Andy, here we go.
[205:40.89]Let me do a test, ready?
[205:43.55]Is it still doing it?
[205:52.85]Better?
[205:57.95]Okay.
[205:58.07]Well, that was crazy.
[205:58.89]That was called egg fried rice.
[206:01.22]It was weird.
[206:04.64]Let me get this back on.
[206:09.07]Alright.
[206:09.31]Well, we've got 30 minutes for another break, but how about...
[206:14.08]How about Silent Burial?
[206:18.64]Silent Burial.
[206:29.11]That's fucking loud.
[206:42.25]Okay.
[206:42.37]Uh, Silent Burial.
[206:50.08]He digs tirelessly.
[206:55.68]He knows what lies beneath.
[207:07.90]What lies beneath?
[207:08.66]Tab controls.
[207:15.69]W, A, S, D, interact as E,
[207:18.66]Zoom is right mouse.
[207:19.56]Look is mouse.
[207:20.16]Stay close to objects for better interaction.
[207:22.11]Okay, so W, S, D, and E. Can't see shit.
[207:31.74]We can turn it up a little bit.
[207:34.90]Hold on, maybe I... Yeah, we can turn it up a little bit.
[207:42.57]The music was just so loud.
[207:44.95]Alright, take bath?
[207:46.21]What did it say?
[207:46.67]Take a bath.
[207:58.74]Am I crazy?
[208:18.45]Patient named David Diagnosis Dissociative Amnesia.
[208:22.62]Disorganized thought patterns, cognitive decay, recommendation, continued observation and therapy.
[208:28.24]Patient exhibits increasing confusion and detachment from reality.
[208:48.25]Jesus.
[208:50.91]I can't keep doing this.
[208:51.84]The gaps in my memory are growing wider.
[208:53.72]I wake up in places I don't recognize.
[208:55.36]I see things that don't belong.
[208:57.34]And worse, I forget.
[208:59.27]Eleanor looks at me like she's afraid.
[209:02.01]And Samuel, I barely remember the sound of his voice.
[209:08.60]Am I eating people?
[209:09.16]What's going on here?
[209:28.13]I think I have to pick up the shovel.
[209:36.42]How do I get it?
[209:42.48]Go to bed maybe?
[209:43.16]Take a bath?
[209:50.07]Do I actually have to take a bath in the bathtub?
[210:06.03]Daddy, why did you keep leaving?
[210:18.68]Ugh.
[210:19.76]Return.
[210:32.58]Alright, now what?
[210:37.65]This message is being broadcast by the Department of Defense of the Republic at 2 AM Eastern Standard Time.
[211:00.45]David, I know something is wrong with me.
[211:01.91]I don't know how much time I have before I forget everything.
[211:05.32]Before I forget you, if I ever seem different, if I ever stop recognizing you, promise me you'll remind me.
[211:14.43]Promise me you won't let me disappear inside my own head.
[211:17.73]I love you.
[211:18.17]I love Samuel.
[211:19.57]Even if one day I don't remember, please know I do.
[211:42.52]Bloody footprints.
[211:48.73]Oh, that's just bloody great.
[211:54.63]What a terrifying sound.
[212:12.37]If you have one of these in your house, don't.
[212:16.57]Just pull the parts out that make that sound.
[212:23.14]Replace it with SpongeBob laughing.
[212:28.39]There's nothing more terrifying than that sound.
[212:32.97]David, your time is ticking.
[212:39.66]I don't think it would be creepier.
[213:03.37]What the fuck is in here?
[213:21.21]Gotta sprint down the hallway, right?
[213:24.48]Woah, that was cool actually.
[213:27.16]I didn't think this was a door, I thought it was a hallway.
[213:41.86]Can I open it?
[213:59.99]When we come to see
[214:18.90]Alright.
[214:21.78]You are up way past your bedtime, by the way, young lady.
[214:46.70]Get to the graveyard?
[214:48.80]Almost done, just a little deeper.
[215:22.92]Remember, please remember who we were.
[215:24.27]My love, David, if you ever find this, please remember, please remember who we were.
[215:29.15]I don't remember my wife writing this.
[215:34.70]Why is my name already on the tombstone?
[215:38.87]Rose, I think we're already dead.
[215:42.67]Some memories are buried for a reason.

[216:37.67]Okay.
[216:39.80]The next one.
[216:42.98]Is called.
[216:47.02]Hmm.

[217:46.38]I think it's fine.
[217:47.18]I think it fits.
[217:48.80]We'll keep the aesthetic.
[217:54.36]Just in case it's crazy loud, which it might be.
[217:59.09]Be aware of that.
[218:06.56]Doesn't sound too bad, actually.
[218:14.15]Go.
[218:19.55]That is the.
[218:34.35]Hey, can you do a voice?
[218:36.80]That's the hey, can you do a voice?
[218:39.80]To anybody on Earth.
[218:45.66]That is the default.
[218:46.94]Can you do a voice?
[218:48.58]Alright, so let's go.
[218:57.29]Yeah, you pull 100 people.
[218:58.73]They're going to do that voice if you ask them that.
[219:00.61]To do a voice.
[219:02.58]Alright, talk to boss.
[219:10.94]Is that not a door?
[219:14.25]Oh, I think this is the boss.
[219:16.52]Look, I know this is short notice.
[219:18.33]Jesus Christ!
[219:19.39]Especially for your first day, but we really need someone for the late shift.
[219:23.91]Maybe you have to go to the hospital and clear quit unexpectedly.
[219:27.78]I can't stick around because I got dinner plans, but I can help you over the phone if you need some motivation.
[219:34.25]What is going on?
[219:35.01]I never get customers past 8 p.m., but I like to keep the place open until about 3 a.m.
[219:40.20]just in case, you know.
[219:41.76]Keep an eye on the CCTV screens around the place in case anybody actually swings by.
[219:48.15]To keep yourself from dozing off, I wrote up a list of tasks.
[219:51.88]They're pretty straightforward.
[219:53.50]Nothing too out of your paycheck.
[219:55.16]Uh-huh.
[219:55.76]Oh, and some advice for the late hours.
[219:58.07]Yeah.
[219:58.81]First, don't open any padlocked doors.
[220:01.97]You ain't getting paid to go in there.
[220:04.37]Secondly, the dumpsters are just across the car park.
[220:08.16]Don't take too long picking up the trash.
[220:10.18]What the fuck's going on, man?
[220:11.62]It's a nice neighborhood, but it's best not to get stuck out in the dark for too long.
[220:16.01]Okay.
[220:17.07]Third, if the lights go out, the breaker switch is in amongst the shelves in the warehouse.
[220:21.73]Not my idea, but whatever.
[220:23.83]I ain't an electrician.
[220:25.66]Lastly, don't go into my office.
[220:28.54]That's everything.
[220:29.52]Any questions?
[220:31.36]I have a ton of them.
[220:32.79]I don't think so.
[220:34.01]Anyway, the list is at the customer service desk.
[220:38.68]Oh, and be sure to clock out by 3 a.m.
[220:41.58]Adios.
[220:42.62]Okay, bye.
[220:44.21]Pick up task sheet at customer service desk.
[220:52.44]Wait, wait, wait.
[220:59.29]Manager really cheapened out on the equipment.
[221:06.38]How do I unpause?
[221:10.57]How do I get out of this menu?
[221:21.38]I think I'm stop-locked.
[221:26.51]I think it's bricked.
[221:27.39]I think it's broken.
[221:34.24]Why is the game paused?
[221:35.70]Hold on.
[221:37.80]Hit Q?
[221:39.54]Oh, shit.
[221:40.13]You got it.
[221:44.77]No, pick that back up.
[221:48.06]I want to be able to look at it.
[221:49.16]Oh my god, what the fuck is going on in this game?
[221:52.37]Am I smoking cigarettes?
[221:59.21]Is this game scary or... Okay, restock toilet paper basket.
[222:12.57]What the hell is coming into the store?
[222:19.38]Wait, that's me!
[222:31.08]Wait.
[222:40.19]Okay, I need to be able to see.
[222:42.22]I gotta be able to see what this is.
[222:46.35]Where is it?
[222:48.77]Where is it?
[222:49.40]Where is it?
[222:53.25]That thing's not even here.
[222:54.79]What?
[223:17.16]Okay.
[223:21.79]Uh, clean up the spill in aisle two.
[223:26.76]Where's the... I need a mop.
[223:39.09]Why am I saying this?
[223:41.50]Yeah.
[223:43.69]I need a mop.
[223:59.15]There's a monster just walking around.
[224:00.47]I don't know what to do about it.
[224:02.92]Find lost fitness DVDs and restock the rack.
[224:07.52]What does that say?
[224:10.83]Note.
[224:11.05]Note.
[224:13.46]Got bored one night and decided to throw on some movies we had in stock.
[224:16.54]Telling you, there's some weird shit on these tapes.
[224:19.27]Might be a coincidence, but one time I tossed a tape in and the fridge lit up like a Christmas tree.
[224:25.32]What?
[224:29.23]Okay.
[224:33.26]Play any VHS on the staff room video player.
[224:48.83]Anybody know where a mop is?
[224:57.74]Control is zoom.
[225:00.90]Oh, here we go.
[225:12.50]So do I just walk over to the spill and we'll look clean?
[225:21.58]Great.
[225:23.20]Okay, restock toilet paper basket.
[225:38.36]Is it ice?
[225:43.93]Mysterious note.
[225:46.13]This is my first day here and shit's already getting weird.
[225:48.70]I think someone might be... might try to pull a fast one on me.
[225:52.06]Gonna start taking notes as an alibi because I do not get paid enough for this bullshit.
[225:57.79]I came in for a 7pm to 3am shift and I think I'm seeing shit outside.
[226:01.45]Like there's something moving out there really slowly.
[226:05.05]Inside seems normal I guess.
[226:07.02]Might have to run to my car at the end of this shift though.
[226:14.87]Okay.
[226:19.85]I still don't understand what possesses somebody to make that sound.
[226:30.40]Alright, here's the exit.
[226:32.94]I need to restock the toilet.
[226:34.31]Where's the toilet paper?
[226:35.49]Is this bread?
[226:48.15]Why is this door so disgusting?
[227:32.53]This farting sounds when you do anything?
[227:38.08]Okay.
[227:40.96]I don't know where the DVDs are.
[227:42.93]I don't know where the toilet paper basket is.
[227:56.81]Yeah!
[227:59.70]Here's the toilet paper, but where is the toilet paper?
[228:03.87]You passed it ten times?
[228:08.01]Where is it?
[228:09.01]In the back?
[228:12.30]It's in the bathroom in the back.
[228:26.16]Please go away.
[228:30.07]I'm at my fucking limit.
[228:40.25]I've worked for feats in being cool and epic and great and so handsome.
[228:51.89]Why can you just pick up every item and just throw it?
[228:58.46]Alright, where's the bathroom?
[228:59.86]You guys said there was a bathroom back here?
[229:24.17]What is going on?
[229:38.65]My limit.
[229:40.96]Uh, where is the bathroom?
[229:42.58]Just tell me where it is.
[229:43.54]I don't care.
[229:44.06]This is the kitchen.
[229:47.85]It's right there?
[230:01.69]The toilet paper is by the breb?
[230:09.86]Is this toilet paper?
[230:11.16]Oh, I thought these were bottles.
[230:20.07]Alright, where's that place where they- right over here?
[230:23.50]Okay.
[230:25.34]Find lost fitness DVDs and re- Okay, where's the fitness DVD?
[230:34.89]Lost fitness DVD.
[230:40.64]Anybody know where that is?
[230:41.36]I'm going to kill you.
[230:52.52]I'm going to kill you again.
[230:53.90]Big fight?
[231:10.93]Anybody know where it is?
[231:15.76]Maybe it's Big Fight.
[231:17.72]Play any VHS on the staff room video player.
[231:19.86]Okay, well this is... I want to watch Big Fight.
[231:23.85]Where's the staff room?
[231:29.10]I saw it before.
[231:29.68]Where the hell was it?
[231:31.10]I'm not putting anything into long-term memory in this game.
[231:44.34]Okay.
[232:04.55]What the, what is this place?
[232:05.79]Like an isolation chamber?
[232:13.50]Alright, that's not the right.
[232:14.24]I need the fitness DVD.
[232:15.96]Lost fitness DVD.
[232:26.35]Is it?
[232:28.38]This might be it.
[232:32.30]Back of DVDs.
[232:39.09]Maybe lost and found.
[232:40.27]I think that's maybe.
[232:43.55]No Didn't you throw a DVD that was hung up by the staff room onto the floor dude, I don't I don't remember Yeah
[233:11.90]I don't even know, I don't know where this rack is.
[233:17.68]Tactic resection?
[233:26.07]I want to see the payoff.
[233:27.13]I'm not done with this one yet.
[233:28.22]I want to see the payoff.
[233:42.90]Maybe in the front of the store?
[233:47.61]Here's the fitness DVD section.
[233:54.10]But where's the fitness DVD?
[233:59.63]Maybe this, right here?
[234:02.11]I'm just gonna assume it's this.
[234:07.70]Okay.
[234:09.39]It was that.
[234:12.38]Phone's ringing?
[234:19.67]Hey kiddo, sorry to call again, how goes that shopping list?
[234:24.28]Don't answer that.
[234:26.02]Anyway, I just remembered there's a second list I forgot to mention.
[234:30.28]Oh no.
[234:31.54]And yeah, that'll need to be done too.
[234:33.77]Oh no.
[234:34.21]You can blame Davey for that one, he was supposed to do his half.
[234:38.89]But then he went and slipped on that ice cube.
[234:42.54]Okay.
[234:44.06]Task sheet.
[234:48.11]Map of the store.
[235:13.78]Okay, restock empty milk fridge.
[235:15.74]Take trash from front door to dumpster.
[235:18.80]Okay, where's the milk?
[235:20.61]Back here, wasn't it?
[235:25.35]There was a weird gross place with all the milk bottles, right?
[235:34.07]Is this milk?
[235:35.67]This is malk.
[235:37.69]Is that the same shit?
[235:46.36]I don't know if this is right.
[236:07.68]That...
[236:30.86]Okay.
[236:39.77]That was weird.
[236:40.60]Take the trash from the front door to the dumpster.
[236:55.74]Okay, where's the dumpster?
[237:07.95]Not this way, apparently.
[237:11.50]Hey, my cat loves your stream.
[237:17.46]Keep it up.
[237:22.37]A skeleton?
[237:23.15]I don't know, but the dumpster is not out here.
[237:52.99]Things messed up.
[237:53.59]Alright, where's the dumpster?
[238:09.46]Oh shit, he's gonna be right here.
[238:13.37]Okay, phone's ringing.
[238:15.77]Apparently that counted, that's fine.
[238:17.81]We're good.
[238:30.00]You know the way I said not to go into my office?
[238:33.18]Scratch that and go there.
[238:36.42]I left some important work I was supposed to do.
[238:39.95]But since you're there already, could you get on that?
[238:42.51]Okay, go up to the office.
[238:43.67]It's on my desk.
[238:45.21]Get it done.
[238:46.31]Okay.
[238:47.90]Pick up the... More tasks?
[238:57.45]Set of mundane tasks.
[239:06.21]Restore lights in warehouse.
[239:27.22]Button over here.
[239:39.73]okay now what wha
[240:20.85]Okay, now what?
[240:39.92]Uh-huh.
[240:45.70]Do I just leave now?
[240:46.64]Get out of the exit?
[241:01.65]Here's the bathroom.
[241:09.44]Wait, what does it say?
[241:14.35]Is this code for the game?
[241:15.89]How do you cook your eggs?
[241:24.72]Brambled.
[241:25.18]Coward.
[241:27.16]That's it.
[241:27.48]I'm drawing a dick and balls.
[241:40.28]Does anyone know?
[241:45.81]What were the ads playing?
[241:51.98]I just saw ads pop up for a second.
[241:54.56]Are the ads going?
[241:57.30]Okay.
[242:00.15]Anyone know how he gets up the stairs?
[242:08.06]Sorry, I didn't load the game properly, but it works now.
[242:15.75]Sample text.
[242:22.32]I think ads are about to start.
[242:27.93]They are.
[242:30.59]Alright, I'll be right back.
[242:31.39]I'm going to get another drink.
[242:34.24]I'll be right back.
[245:48.92]How's it going?
[245:50.74]Okay.
[245:51.78]What was the last thing?
[245:52.36]Let me crack this open.
[245:58.33]I'll play this one for like another 10 minutes.
[246:02.61]And then I want to move on to another one.
[246:06.00]This one has been crazy.
[246:12.26]Okay, we're going to talk to the boss again.
[246:19.09]Oh, God.
[246:20.99]Didn't I already do this?
[246:25.28]Wait, we're doing it again?
[246:29.91]Did I lose?
[246:38.92]We never get customers past 8 p.m.
[246:41.96]But I like to keep the place open till about 3 a.m.
[246:44.50]just in case, you know.
[246:46.08]Keep an eye on the CCTV screens around the place in case anybody actually swings by.
[246:51.51]To keep yourself from dozing off, I wrote out the list of tasks.
[246:56.23]They're pretty straightforward.
[246:57.84]Nothing too out of your paycheck.
[246:59.10]I think I lost.
[247:00.12]Oh, and some advice for the late hours.
[247:03.16]First, don't open any padlocked doors.
[247:06.30]You ain't getting paid to go in there.
[247:08.53]Secondly, the dumpsters are just across the car park.
[247:12.48]Don't take too long taking out the trash.
[247:15.90]It's a nice neighborhood, but it's best not to get stuck out in the dark for too long.
[247:20.48]Third, if the lights go out, the breaker switches in amongst the shelves in the warehouse.
[247:26.23]Not my idea, but whatever.
[247:28.33]I ain't an electrician.
[247:29.87]Lastly, don't go into my office.
[247:32.88]That's everything.
[247:33.86]Any questions?
[247:37.32]Didn't think so.
[247:38.81]Anyway, the list is at the customer service desk.
[247:41.85]I'm very curious what happens there.
[247:43.07]Oh, and be sure to clock out by 3 a.m.
[247:45.87]Adios.
[248:00.75]Slice the bread.
[248:01.91]Hey!
[248:04.09]Oh, I can actually see him now!
[248:13.94]How do I get out?
[248:27.42]Is there a key in one of these?
[248:28.30]Ah!
[248:33.59]Put it down, put it down.
[248:43.93]Get me out of this room right now.
[249:04.23]There's no bread to slice.
[249:06.03]There's no bread to slice.
[249:19.63]Do I have to open every single one of these?
[249:21.30]Where is this?
[249:22.22]Wait.
[249:23.24]Oh, I thought there was a note.
[249:24.10]Shit.
[249:30.59]What?
[249:32.22]Bro, what are you doing?
[249:33.12]Lock in.
[249:33.61]I'm locked in.
[249:34.39]Look at how locked in I am.
[249:47.87]Shit's getting in the way.
[250:00.73]What the?
[250:01.59]What do I do?
[250:06.84]It's gonna be a key inside one of these, right?
[250:11.85]What a mess!
[250:16.32]Is one of these a telephone?
[250:28.65]What?
[250:31.35]Yeah!
[250:31.47]Yeah!
[250:38.73]You put your head back in right now.
[250:41.05]P.S.
[250:41.53]It's a feature, but also don't do this again.
[250:43.37]And don't try it on any other level.
[250:45.34]It won't work.
[250:46.54]I tried.
[250:47.18]I don't know why it works for some levels, but not for this.
[250:50.36]Maybe it goes back to my childhood.
[250:52.13]I was always clipping out of class.
[250:53.89]But enough about me.
[250:54.53]Let's talk about you.
[250:56.15]What brings someone to try to clip out of a map?
[250:58.33]Why are you doing this?
[250:59.98]It hurts you more than it hurts me.
[251:02.18]Uh, Casper, if you're reading this, I'm sorry I failed.
[251:05.23]I couldn't fix the clipping.
[251:06.37]Please forgive me.
[251:07.15]Please.
[251:08.33]Player, send flowers to Casper's mouse.
[251:11.21]Here is his address.
[251:15.26]Bro.
[251:20.96]Note from Jay.
[251:25.03]Alright, put it down!
[251:25.87]I don't want to hold it anymore!
[251:27.15]Put it down now!
[251:31.72]Put it down!
[251:34.14]What?!
[251:49.08]Now we're gonna slice some bread.
[252:08.92]Friendly?
[252:12.29]Alright.
[252:20.10]I'm done with this one.
[252:21.72]I'm done.
[252:22.76]I'm moving on.
[252:23.17]I'm done with this one.
[252:24.29]I'm not doing this one anymore.
[252:29.77]Bring milk into storage.
[252:31.36]I don't want to collect the floating milks.
[252:33.38]151?!
[252:33.46]!
[252:41.49]I'm not putting 151 milks into that 151 storage slots.
[252:45.56]I ain't doing it.
[252:54.47]What?
[252:54.59]With a phone ringing this whole time?
[252:56.05]No way.
[253:10.65]Yeah.
[253:10.77]Yeah.
[253:10.89]Yeah.
[253:11.60]Where's this phone?
[253:20.93]Huh?
[253:23.65]No.
[253:24.39]No.
[253:25.30]No.
[253:27.58]No.
[253:29.94]No.
[253:33.06]No.
[253:47.10]I fell off the face of the Earth.
[253:49.21]Where is this phone?
[253:50.35]I'm going to freak out.
[254:00.26]Where is the phone?
[254:12.51]God damn it!
[254:31.18]fucking out of this game.
[254:35.91]This game was called Employee of the Month and I don't want to play it anymore.
[254:45.20]Coming up next is one that I think a lot of people may have been waiting for.
[254:51.59]Ladies and gentlemen.
[254:54.21]Time to play.
[254:57.66]The Candle.
[255:09.13]Okay, making any spooky scenes and scares, player discretion is advised.
[255:11.78]This is loud.
[255:14.84]I didn't, by the way, I didn't tell you to put this in the game.
[255:17.51]Also, I don't give a fuck about feedback.
[255:18.93]I will not listen and there will never be a patch for this game.
[255:21.09]I don't care.
[255:21.59]That's perfect.
[255:25.64]It's so loud.
[255:30.22]Okay, that was fucking bad.
[255:32.53]It was like a fucking TTS voice.
[255:39.05]Alright dude, hold on a second.
[255:41.49]This shit's gonna come way down.
[256:07.59]Okay, the carnival is in the game.
[256:09.51]The carnival is in the game.
[256:10.43]That's important.
[256:14.39]Alright, can I give a little context?
[256:16.10]People have no idea what's going on.
[256:18.20]Uh, somebody in the community made this game after I just talked a bunch of shit about video games and I said I wanted to make a game.
[256:25.91]And they just made it.
[256:28.57]And here it is.
[256:30.27]Everything you see here is some bullshit that I probably said in the conversation.
[256:35.36]We'll see.
[256:37.37]Okay, how to play, uh, Lilypad Lander.
[256:41.21]Watch as the meter bounces back and forth, click to the angle and power.
[256:44.36]Okay.
[256:46.93]It's too much sound effects.
[257:07.36]I gotta get at least one.
[257:19.23]Fuck.
[257:19.35]You probably told him to make it too loud.
[257:21.72]No, I did not.
[257:27.94]Oh, you did?
[257:31.81]Yes, you did.
[257:32.71]No, I did not.
[257:33.47]When did I say make the game wicked fucking loud?
[257:35.94]I've never said that in my life.
[257:44.05]What did this kid say?
[257:44.87]I need $10 bills.
[257:51.52]Get the clip, get the clip, get the clip.
[257:53.32]Go ahead and find it, as I definitely didn't say it.
[258:02.47]That's not even helping.
[258:07.10]Okay, that's better.
[258:10.93]Alternate mashing W and S to pump the water gun back and forth.
[258:14.25]Be the first to pop... I didn't tell you to put that in.
[258:26.73]Ah, you're wrong.
[258:27.27]Yes, I can.
[258:27.73]You think that's hard?
[258:28.47]I can do that easy.
[258:29.27]Wimp.
[258:33.27]That's it.
[258:51.13]What are these weird kids that are in this game?
[258:54.21]How many tickets do I have?
[258:56.25]635 tickets.
[258:57.12]Perfect.
[259:00.25]You got anything to say, kid?
[259:05.58]Why do you have a lot of fucking coins?
[259:26.98]Alright, healthy, fun snacks for the whole family.
[259:29.57]Oh, there's cats!
[259:30.27]You can put- Oh, they put the cats in the game!
[259:31.77]You can pet the cats and stuff, right?
[259:35.09]A single is 20, double is 40, triple is- A triple what?
[259:37.92]Banana Bros.
[259:39.56]Healthy, fun snacks for the whole family.
[259:41.62]I need- Where do I get money?
[259:45.65]Yep, cats are here.
[259:50.55]I need- I need money.
[259:55.16]You're ugly.
[260:09.20]I don't give a shit that you're a little kid.
[260:10.76]Fuck you.
[260:13.58]Where do you get coins?
[260:23.73]No, I need more coins!
[260:25.04]How do I- Okay, how do I play this one?
[260:29.92]What do you- I need coins!
[260:30.90]Where do you get money?
[260:33.95]Where do you get money?
[260:34.57]Shit, I need money.
[260:38.08]I can't do it and everything.
[260:40.46]A candle is required to enter.
[261:06.83]Oh!
[261:08.97]Okay, this is important.
[261:12.55]my thanks good sir I am the count Gerald robertson a pleasure to make your acquaintance nice to meet you now I understand that my present form may be eerily shocking to you but please relax your senses and allow me to tell you my tale in life I was the master of this estate
[261:37.14]I came from a long line of tradesmen hailing from across the Atlantic.
[261:42.83]My father left me with meager assets which I, after discovering alternative business strategies, was able to forge into a booming enterprise.
[261:54.20]But, as I grew in wealth and influence, my state's staff grew in jealousy and conspiracy.
[262:02.41]Influenced by my cunning steward, they plotted against me in secret.
[262:07.42]One night, they dragged me from my chambers down into the bowels of a manor,
[262:12.43]I like the story.
[262:15.09]I was killed, murdered, sacrificed, abdicated.
[262:24.66]Terrible.
[262:25.72]In a Kabbalistic ritual, my body was laid to rest, but my soul, filled with a melancholic rage, refused to fade into the beyond.
[262:39.81]Please, stranger, I beg of you, enter the manor and grant me a proper burial.
[262:47.69]Take me on your expedition and, upon fulfilling my request, my fortune will be yours.
[262:55.02]But please, take care in my deliverance.
[262:58.95]This flame holds the essence of my soul.
[263:02.05]If the flame is lost, so shall I be.
[263:05.98]Wandering the halls of the manor in aimless, mindless perpetuity.
[263:11.82]Make haste, but be careful.
[263:13.86]Where's my gun with two bullets?
[263:15.19]Thanks, yet again.
[263:23.29]Is the game stupid for a 5%...
[263:31.18]This ain't real, right?
[263:32.50]This ain't real, is it?
[263:38.22]Oh, whoops.
[263:42.06]Candlewick.
[263:43.15]Before you venture forth much further, I must explain this to you.
[263:50.08]It's so dark.
[263:52.78]Alright, I'm looking for...
[264:20.59]Oh, by the way, the candle is burning, I think.
[264:22.29]It could be, uh... I think it's four hours in the game.
[264:25.42]It deletes itself, I believe.
[264:31.76]Oh, right!
[264:32.31]Sprinting!
[264:33.07]Sprinting makes the candle go ten times faster, right?
[264:38.53]Was that my shitty idea, or was that your shitty idea?
[264:45.30]What the hell was that?
[264:51.32]I don't have a light anymore.
[264:54.00]How do I get a light?
[264:56.37]Where do you get a light?
[264:58.89]Oh, wait, it never comes back ever again.
[265:00.47]I think it never comes back.
[265:15.79]It doesn't ever come back.
[265:30.32]Oh, no.
[265:33.18]Oh, no.
[265:43.70]Oh, who came up with this game?
[265:46.22]What a piece of shit.
[265:51.51]Okay.
[265:52.25]Take the throw dart at the target.
[265:54.33]Avoid clicking on decoy targets.
[266:03.55]What are you talking about?
[266:08.47]Wait, that's a decoy target?
[266:16.10]That was hard.
[266:16.72]That was too hard.
[266:17.56]That needs to be tweaked.
[266:18.94]You need to patch the game.
[266:20.87]I know in the beginning.
[266:21.57]I know what I said.
[266:23.07]I know.
[266:23.53]This game will never have a patch.
[266:25.17]I don't listen to feedback.
[266:25.97]Fuck you.
[266:26.57]I get it.
[266:27.15]That's what I said.
[266:29.32]Needs a little bit of work.
[266:31.18]Teacher, cut her finger.
[266:35.95]And that's why I'm at the carnival today.
[266:40.15]Because my mommy said that I shouldn't see blood.
[266:43.33]And she said that we could go and get some ice cream.
[266:49.24]And I don't know where she went.
[266:59.11]Nothing to do with me.
[266:59.67]Alright, let's see the bumper cars.
[267:20.43]I need a candle to go in there.
[267:33.11]Parking is parking lot over here.
[267:52.17]Is there anything actually over here?
[267:54.67]Entrance, par- Can I just walk in a circle?
[268:07.85]Staff only.
[268:21.21]Candle required to enter.
[268:22.77]I gotta go get the candle and come back here.
[268:28.66]Alright, let me get the candle.
[268:41.16]My thanks, good sir.
[268:43.28]Can I skip this?
[268:44.60]No, I can't skip it.
[268:47.47]Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
[268:50.86]Listen to this again.
[268:54.94]Listen to this whole thing again.
[268:57.73]I don't want to hear the tale again.
[269:02.01]I can't skip it.
[269:05.19]I can't skip it.
[269:05.73]You gotta pass the game.
[269:08.24]You gotta pass the game and make it so you can skip.
[269:18.89]You gotta pass the game and let people skip the cutscene.
[269:20.85]The opening cutscene's gotta be skipped.
[269:24.31]It's gotta be able to be skipped.
[269:33.15]Walk into the building to skip it?
[269:35.70]No patches.
[269:37.04]Fuck you.
[269:38.32]I know.
[269:38.74]I know.
[269:38.96]I get it.
[269:39.26]That's the philosophy.
[269:41.20]I get it.
[269:42.44]If I ever make a game, that disclaimer is going up too.
[269:44.97]If I ever make a game, I'm telling you, it's going to say that.
[269:48.79]It's going to say, hey.
[269:50.03]Hey, asshole.
[269:51.81]You can patch it and add this too.
[269:53.28]You can add, hey, asshole.
[269:55.56]I will never patch the game.
[269:57.50]But you might patch the game and not even care.
[270:00.08]Hey, asshole.
[270:01.25]I will never patch this game.
[270:02.69]There will never be feedback taken.
[270:04.68]This is my piece of art.
[270:06.70]Shove it up your ass.
[270:09.19]It could be a 10 out of 10 game.
[270:10.27]I don't care.
[270:12.20]But you add that into a patch, yes.
[270:16.06]Take me on your expedition and upon fulfilling my request, my fortune will be yours.
[270:23.51]But please, take care in my deliverance.
[270:26.48]Alright, I want to take this back to the... This flame holds the essence of my soul.
[270:30.44]If the flame is lost, so shall I be.
[270:34.47]Wandering the halls of the manor in endless, mindless perpetuity.
[270:39.96]Alright, here we go.
[270:45.80]I got a candle now.
[270:48.53]I have access to the prize room.
[270:54.79]Me.
[270:57.77]Uh, try having some fun sometime, Bozo.
[271:10.42]The Barter Pass.
[271:24.10]Like any of the other cool prizes in the shop, Barter Pass prizes can be bought with tickets.
[271:29.07]Barter Pass prizes can only be bought sequentially.
[271:31.19]This means you have to buy the previous prize tier to unlock the next.
[271:36.16]White Wax.
[271:37.68]Apple Cider.
[271:39.43]Oh, that is nice.
[271:42.25]Ocean breeze.
[271:47.81]All day snack pass.
[271:50.22]Okay, I need tickets.
[271:57.19]What's all this?
[271:57.67]Is that a stew?
[272:02.17]Oh, I need tickets and candy and stuff.
[272:03.83]Alright, nice.
[272:11.77]Alright, I want to go in the back of that.
[272:13.36]Shit, it's going to be, the candle's going to blow up.
[272:24.93]What is this?
[272:36.58]I'll play, wait, what is it?
[272:37.64]I'll play.
[272:43.40]Put Blackjack in the game.
[272:44.48]Hit me.
[273:03.09]No, I want more money.
[273:05.01]Get out of here, you fucking loser.
[273:12.86]Where do you get money?
[273:13.76]I want- I need money to play.
[273:27.04]Get a job?
[273:28.38]It's in the house.
[273:32.57]No!
[273:34.21]No!
[273:34.93]The cannon's out again!
[273:35.99]I gotta- It's that quick?
[273:43.63]Where does this actually take you?
[273:49.13]It opens up the candle's Steam page.
[273:57.38]Okay, there's no actual deal.
[273:58.82]I think that's fucking illegal, by the way.
[274:00.84]I don't think you can do that.
[274:02.26]I think it just takes you to the Steam page.
[274:04.99]Okay.
[274:05.73]It takes you to the Steam page.
[274:08.51]Alright, we're good.
[274:10.55]I lost again.
[274:37.27]It's too fast!
[274:39.53]That's gotta be slowed down a little bit.
[274:41.22]That's gotta be slowed down a little bit.
[274:50.73]Movie mouse rapidly in a circle, click to release.
[274:53.82]Knock down all the bottles, alright.
[275:01.79]Why would anybody play this?
[275:15.53]I'm going.
[275:16.03]I'm... Alright.
[275:16.83]It's time to beat the candle.
[275:18.41]I'm going in.
[275:23.14]There's a lot of goofy shit in this game.
[275:24.56]This is fine.
[275:25.08]I like it.
[275:25.76]This is great.
[275:31.31]Alright.
[275:31.49]Here we go.
[275:32.87]No running.
[275:35.66]No patches.
[275:36.12]Fuck you.
[275:36.42]What don't you understand?
[275:37.24]I know.
[275:41.43]I... Trust me.
[275:42.05]I know.
[275:44.42]Hey, I invented the no patches, fuck you, okay?
[275:47.86]I invented that.
[275:49.42]You don't think I understand it?
[275:51.59]How do I go in the matter?
[275:52.99]Quick.
[275:54.67]Okay.
[275:56.18]Oh, come on.
[276:06.84]Before you can enter the crypt which holds my rotting corpse, you must first search for the lock combination my servants used to seal me away.
[276:17.22]I imagine you won't be able to find the whole thing at once.
[276:23.01]The blasted schema's probably scattered its part all over the place.
[276:28.94]I bid you the best of luck.
[276:34.03]Okay.
[276:34.31]I can't run.
[276:46.62]But don't run.
[276:47.60]What the hell just happened?
[276:52.64]I just got hurt.
[276:54.67]Oh, I forgot.
[276:55.37]I forgot.
[276:55.99]I said to put in the thing where you could get, you burn yourself with a candle and get hurt.
[276:59.13]If you put it too close to your face.
[277:01.73]Right.
[277:06.86]What the fuck are you supposed to do about that guy?
[277:25.08]This is fucking stupid.
[277:27.08]But I gotta beat it.
[277:29.86]The game's impossible.
[277:38.73]Bro, your game sucked.
[277:40.82]I didn't make this game.
[277:41.84]I didn't make this game.
[277:45.28]I didn't make it.
[277:46.64]I'm just the one that gave all the ideas and don't... This game is awesome.
[277:57.05]You don't know shit about gaming.
[277:58.95]You don't know anything about video games.
[278:00.24]What do you know about games?
[278:03.11]Before you venture forth much further, I must explain this to you.
[278:08.67]Hey, Todd Howard didn't make Starfield either.
[278:12.72]You must first search for the lock combination my servants used to seal me away.
[278:20.59]Yeah, hold on a second.
[278:24.26]I'm sure Todd Howard had way more time than one stream where I just talked a bunch of shit and rifled out a bunch of ideas in two minutes.
[278:34.72]I didn't have a whiteboard behind me.
[278:36.20]There weren't meetings.
[278:37.44]I didn't have a whole team of people to talk to about what was and what wasn't a good idea.
[278:42.51]Starfield took six years to make.
[278:45.65]I talked about the candle in two minutes.
[278:58.78]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[279:00.18]First enemy, first enemy.
[279:00.93]What do I do?
[279:09.58]What the fuck?
[279:15.75]How are you supposed to avoid the first enemy of the game?
[279:18.84]How do I get away from the first enemy?
[279:25.72]Isn't Todd Howard sitting there dying over and over again to the first enemy?
[279:30.31]What's going on here?
[279:31.21]How do I not die to the first enemy?
[279:36.22]Now this is ridiculous.
[279:37.16]How do I not die to the first enemy?
[279:44.85]I can't with this game.
[279:47.25]Ugh.
[279:48.46]Before you venture forth much further, I must explain this to you.
[279:52.94]Alright, do I just sprint forward?
[279:54.76]Before you can enter the crypt which holds my rotting corpse, you must first search for the lock combination my servants used to seal me away.
[280:03.53]You can't sprint.
[280:05.03]I need the gun!
[280:06.27]Yeah!
[280:06.39]I imagine you won't be able to find the whole thing at once.
[280:10.62]Oh, I love it.
[280:14.31]I love every second of this.
[280:15.83]This is hilarious.
[280:18.33]Okay, I have to- I think I have to sidestep him.
[280:31.29]I can't see anything!
[280:47.47]Nice, love that reference.
[281:02.98]Stick to the walls.
[281:15.49]Good.
[281:16.55]Good.
[281:17.09]The farts are good.
[281:26.56]Who's playing the piano?
[281:47.47]Okay.
[281:48.21]I explored that whole section.
[281:49.47]Let's go right.
[281:57.47]I hear him.
[281:57.77]Where is he?
[282:02.36]Where is he?
[282:02.68]Where is he?
[282:06.34]Where is he?
[282:06.62]Where is he?
[282:07.10]Where is he?
[282:31.00]Come on!
[282:31.50]Give me a key!
[282:41.19]I have no idea where I'm going.
[282:42.18]No clue at all.
[282:47.80]Oh, that's Ratboobie.
[282:48.50]I don't know what that is.
[282:55.37]I can't stop though.
[282:56.01]The thing's chasing me through the halls!
[283:15.94]What the hell is that?
[283:18.36]What?
[283:21.33]What am I missing?
[283:21.93]What am I missing?
[283:22.39]I'm missing something.
[283:33.89]Fuck you, man.
[283:47.60]The wax, I think, is telling me where I've been before.
[283:50.70]Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[283:53.43]Come on.
[283:56.83]Come on!
[284:04.55]Come on!
[284:07.79]Shit.
[284:11.52]Shit.
[284:22.41]Oh fuck, he's right behind me!
[284:35.64]Am I getting money for this?
[284:40.00]Oh my god, I have $62!
[284:41.55]Door.
[284:49.82]Okay.
[284:51.44]Wait, isn't there a hunger meter?
[285:15.84]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[285:18.26]Hold on.
[285:21.04]I think there's a hunger mechanic.
[285:25.42]Where if you don't eat, you're 40% slower.
[285:30.15]Oh no, that is what happened.
[285:31.53]There's thirst and there's fear.
[285:40.16]Oh no.
[285:46.03]You said there should be one.
[285:52.73]Hey, Rome wasn't built in a day.
[285:58.51]With a little bit of work, you know, a few patches.
[286:07.10]Imagine not knowing what this was and getting it on Steam and you see that disclaimer and you go, well, what the fuck, man?
[286:15.38]This sucks.
[286:20.54]I'm going to open the story.
[286:21.18]It's going to be right there.
[286:24.82]I knew it.
[286:31.12]Hey, the best part about that though... I can't sprint anymore!
[287:10.12]What are the reviews like on the Steam page for this?
[287:15.64]There's got to be a few people that are just like, I don't get it.
[287:17.94]It sucks.
[287:23.67]It's highly positive.
[287:24.85]100% positive.
[287:33.86]I don't even know how to get out, but I have $62 and you bet your ass I'm getting out of this place.
[287:40.41]And I'm gonna go buy a hot dog or something.
[287:51.66]I mean, can I die?
[287:52.44]I have no idea where the front of the house is.
[288:16.89]Is that my stomach growling?
[288:18.45]I thought that was the monster the whole time.
[288:34.75]You're starving.
[288:35.69]I don't even know how to get out of the house!
[288:51.45]Stop biting your lip.
[288:52.91]I can't help it.
[289:09.36]I can't... I can't get out.
[289:20.41]I can't see anything.
[289:21.55]I have no idea where I am.
[289:23.89]Look for wax?
[289:26.51]I don't think there is wax, man.
[289:29.70]How does it feel to reap what you sow?
[289:30.98]I think this is hilarious.
[289:34.86]I think this is the funniest fucking thing ever.
[289:40.05]It's hilarious that somebody made that incoherent ramble that I went on.
[289:46.42]Somebody made it.
[289:47.24]It's hilarious.
[289:48.10]I love this.
[289:51.34]I would love to get out of the house though.
[289:54.90]Right here, come on.
[289:57.17]Looks like the front of the house, right?
[290:15.27]I'm just trying to stay on the right side.
[290:18.41]I'm getting more money though.
[290:20.82]Which I'm happy about.
[290:27.63]Just stay on the right wall and you'll eventually get to the door.
[290:31.49]That's my philosophy right now.
[290:32.70]82 bucks.
[290:51.63]Can I buy another candle?
[291:00.13]How have I not been here?
[291:04.55]Oh, this is the dining room.
[291:10.36]I was already... No, it's not, is it?
[291:13.23]Where the hell am I?
[291:57.43]Did I make it?
[292:00.43]Where am I?
[292:02.14]What?
[292:06.14]I... What the fuck?
[292:26.40]I went deeper into the house and we're just gonna be lost forever.
[292:29.13]Okay, here we go.
[292:36.53]My thanks, good sir.
[292:39.33]I am the town...
[292:43.84]I'm going right for that back door.
[292:45.10]I gotta collect a bunch of money and then leave.
[292:48.44]I want 50 bucks.
[292:49.98]I bet you...
[293:13.57]I need 50.
[293:15.79]50 bucks and I'm out.
[293:17.32]50 and I'm out of here.
[293:31.01]38.
[293:31.23]Alright, don't get lost.
[293:42.51]Alright, I'm out.
[293:45.25]Let's go.
[293:45.73]Get out.
[293:50.78]How do I get out?
[293:51.88]I've already lost.
[293:57.79]Wait, what is this?
[293:59.55]Bathroom?
[294:05.20]Can I do anything in here?
[294:06.08]I don't think so.
[294:14.94]Is it randomized?
[294:16.25]It might be.
[294:19.77]Alright, I need to get out.
[294:22.27]No.
[294:22.91]Keep going this way.
[294:25.18]I gotta follow the candle splatters.
[294:36.51]This way.
[294:40.58]Whoa!
[295:04.81]Alright, last, last try.
[295:08.96]Last try and I'm out.
[295:21.31]Try to follow a guide?
[295:26.04]I don't know if you can follow a guide with this fucked up game, man.
[295:38.44]I think it is very nice.
[295:43.45]I just want two draws of money and I'm out of here.
[296:10.13]You're already right here.
[296:11.27]What the hell?
[296:12.23]I'm out.
[296:14.22]Oh shit
[296:48.02]I need more money than this.
[296:49.06]20 bucks.
[297:08.54]I got it.
[297:09.00]I'm out.
[297:11.17]I'll take 20.
[297:11.65]That's fine.
[297:21.48]I want to buy food.
[297:34.96]Alright, there's dogs that you can pet.
[297:37.60]Oh, he's gone.
[297:43.91]What else is over here?
[297:51.87]Why is there a maze?
[297:53.25]Did I say to make a maze?
[298:04.31]I said make a hedge maze.
[298:17.41]A wonderful sound effect.
[298:18.47]I love it.
[298:21.94]Alright, I got a break.
[298:22.70]This is probably going to be the last break.
[298:25.09]And then I will play this for a little bit longer and we'll see how it goes.
[298:30.18]In about two minutes.
[298:43.70]I just want to buy a piece of food.
[298:46.08]I want to see what it does.
[298:48.08]And then we can see what happens after.
[298:52.17]To do an all-nighter?
[298:54.51]No, I can't do an all-nighter.
[299:03.44]Alright, $20 gets me... a single.
[299:08.41]Enjoy.
[299:09.13]Did I just eat it?
[299:14.58]Okay, I got a single.
[299:18.21]I forgot about the blackjack.
[299:19.53]Shit.
[299:33.66]You're an adult.
[299:34.48]You can do whatever you want.
[299:37.01]I kind of want to eat dinner.
[299:45.86]It's like 10.32.
[299:47.30]Around 11 o'clock.
[299:50.20]Something is amiss.
[299:54.41]You seem that the floor plan of the manor is changed.
[300:00.05]The walls have shifted.
[300:04.07]They randomly generate the game every time you go back in.
[300:14.28]Actually, not a bad thing, because you can get more money.
[300:21.93]I hope I don't die here, but I'm paused, right?
[300:25.74]The game is paused.
[300:26.70]Let's hope so.
[300:28.56]uh I'll be back last break of the night I'll see you guys in a few minutes and ads are gonna play you guys in a few minutes
[305:27.33]And I lost.
[305:28.01]I died in the BRB when I was BRB.
[305:34.32]There's not a pause menu.
[305:37.82]Just a menu.
[305:49.52]That was the candle.
[305:51.84]That was a good one.
[305:53.56]It was funny.
[305:55.29]I loved every second of that.
[305:58.11]Actually good work.
[305:59.57]Actually funny.
[306:03.13]I have no idea if that game is completable.
[306:06.10]Maybe it is.
[306:09.68]But it was great.
[306:10.64]Thanks for making it.
[306:15.93]Let's see.
[306:17.33]We'll do this one.
[306:22.08]A lakeside walk in the Dolomites.
[306:26.85]Lakeside Walk in the Dolomites.
[306:41.04]Okay.
[306:41.38]W-O-S-D-E is Redocument Change Page.
[306:47.53]Okay.
[306:47.69]This is going to be the... This is probably the last one.
[306:57.29]for tonight.
[307:00.09]How's the audio, good?
[307:00.79]I think I just walk around, right?
[307:13.85]Uh, Algae Alley, Mount 1000.
[307:16.33]Just taking a walk.
[307:26.80]Nothing in the trash.
[307:47.79]Pay the electric bill.
[307:57.79]What are those?
[308:02.61]There is no sprint.
[308:08.42]There is only walk.
[308:17.17]Alagi, also known as Ali in the local dialect, is a small Venetian town with a thousand inhabitants nestled among the spectacular peaks of the Dolomites.
[308:26.93]Its most distinctive feature is the picturesque lake, formed in 1771, following a landslide that detached from Mount Iz, a modest peak on the right bank of the Côte d'Ivoire River.
[308:39.89]The massive debris buried three villagers forever, altering the landscape.
[308:43.09]Despite its tragic origin, the lake is now the beating heart of local tourism.
[308:49.28]Its crystal clear waters reflect the towering walls of Mount Civetta.
[308:53.69]attracting visitors from around the world, from skiing enthusiasts to hikers in pursuit of breathtaking views.
[309:02.16]And aliens.
[309:06.05]Oh, you're just a duck.
[309:12.84]Kind of a scary duck, but fine.
[309:23.46]Did you kill the duck?
[309:38.35]Somebody's gonna be right behind me.
[309:41.83]No sprint either is bad.
[309:53.02]Cut that out.
[310:04.38]It was a deer.
[310:05.62]Fuck you.
[310:06.38]My arm hurts.
[310:25.86]Oh, that sucked.
[310:28.53]Don't have a heart attack.
[310:30.87]I've got a strong fucking... I've got a strong ticker, okay?
[310:40.31]Ow.
[310:46.30]In the summer, its lake takes on a...
[310:53.56]something.
[310:55.54]I keep trying to touch my face and it's in the way.
[310:58.87]Okay.
[311:04.04]Alright, now I'm ready for that.
[311:06.92]I'm ready for something to jump in front of the screen again.
[311:24.00]Embracing, hold on.
[311:29.38]If I sit down like this, I'll be fine.
[311:35.35]I'm going to punch the microphone up.
[311:43.42]It's Dolomites.
[311:45.94]Dolomites.
[311:55.52]I'm never having a swing set.
[311:56.68]It's too creepy.
[312:00.95]What is creepier than a single swing set just doing that?
[312:03.83]No.
[312:07.26]Slide is fine.
[312:08.60]My kid's gonna have a slide.
[312:14.19]Primarily tourist destination, despite possessing the resource to foster a thriving economy.
[312:18.86]Local traditions such as woodworking, wrought iron craftsmanship, and gastronomy have almost disappeared.
[312:26.17]Okay.
[312:31.35]What's that?
[312:33.50]The Lake of Shadows, the chilling disappearance of Aligi.
[312:40.67]Mysterious disappearances.
[312:44.26]These occurrences, now collectively referred to as the Mysteries of Aligi, have inspired numerous books attempting to shed light on... Dude, I can't... I'm reading the story!
[313:05.20]I'm reading the story... I'm reading about how scary you are.
[313:07.44]I get it.
[313:21.23]I like the atmosphere of this one.
[313:22.35]This one's spooky.
[313:24.16]This one's good.
[313:28.30]Another deer.
[313:29.07]Three, two, one.
[313:33.44]Somebody's taking a piss.
[313:34.20]That's fine.
[313:51.52]Okay, that was weird.
[314:02.64]No, I don't want to... Ooh.
[314:06.72]I'll be crushed?
[314:11.53]Ugh, yuck.
[314:34.65]Haunted house.
[315:01.23]That's the dude's backpack.
[315:10.26]Families of the victims want the truth.
[315:12.52]Aligi and the mystery of the disappearances.
[315:14.18]For over six months, the small community of Aligi has been shaken by a series of mysterious disappearances.
[315:19.27]Five people, including three young women and two adults, have vanished without a trace.
[315:24.60]Aces spark growing unease.
[315:28.48]Okay.
[315:28.84]Today, history seems to be repeating itself.
[315:30.26]Local authorities have intensified their search efforts, but no concrete leads have emerged.
[315:34.65]More than 40 years have passed.
[315:37.46]The scars left by the past disappearances are still fresh in our community's memory.
[315:44.11]Okay, that's scary.
[315:46.22]With each day that passes without answers, the mysteries of Allergy grow ever deeper, stirring suspicions and giving rise to shadowy theories.
[315:56.76]This is the backpack the guy was just wearing, right?
[316:18.38]Do not show me an axe unless I can use it.
[316:31.49]Potato chips.
[316:40.94]Again, a tree.
[317:03.78]April 6, 2025.
[317:15.15]Did this game just come out?
[317:20.86]Investigating the recent disappearances, I've uncovered documents and testimonies linking these events to similar cases from the 1930s and 1980s.
[317:29.27]Missing individuals seem to have vanished into thin air.
[317:32.26]No bodies have ever resurfaced.
[317:33.86]No traces have ever been found.
[317:36.32]Local whispers tell of an ancient something bound to the lake, a sacrifice.
[317:39.54]Okay, I can't read it.
[317:42.01]But it's a faceless figure rise from the water.
[317:46.95]The lake might conceal geological dangers such as sudden backflows or whirlpools, but could nature really be selective in choosing its victims?
[317:55.08]And why do no bodies ever resurface?
[317:59.18]On Paris, records mention strange events occurring in the lake in the past centuries.
[318:02.28]They speak of bodies never... Cold worshiping... Bro.
[318:19.76]Gotta be aliens.
[318:21.32]Gonna be aliens.
[318:22.66]Watch.
[318:26.71]I thought those were eyes.
[318:36.98]Which way do I go?
[318:57.60]No, don't do that!
[319:01.13]Okay, I'll go- I'm going this way.
[319:03.11]Uhhh, don't do that either.
[319:03.77]Oh!
[319:06.95]Don't do that.
[319:15.73]It's aliens!
[319:16.68]I told you it was aliens!
[319:18.38]I told you it was aliens!
[319:39.45]What the hell?
[319:46.34]I told you it was aliens.
[319:59.70]What?
[320:01.48]Oh, damn.
[320:02.47]They're getting me.
[320:30.55]That's horrifying.
[320:46.85]They're not going to obliterate the planet, right?
[320:49.05]I thought they were going to shoot a laser at it.
[320:53.96]That was a good one.
[320:54.40]I like it a lot.
[320:59.79]It was spooky.
[321:00.77]Walking around.
[321:01.71]They did a couple of cool jump scares.
[321:03.21]And then aliens.
[321:07.24]That was great.
[321:11.15]Alright guys, that's it.
[321:12.61]I'm so hungry.
[321:14.49]Once that fried rice game came up, it was like, oh no.
[321:22.26]What about Oblivion?
[321:24.23]So let me tell you what's going to happen.
[321:25.89]Here's the deal.
[321:28.39]It's kind of loud, hold on.
[321:36.79]Exit this.
[321:39.47]Now listen here, Buster.
[321:43.38]Okay, so on Monday, Squeaks and I are going to play some Switch stuff.
[321:52.41]We're going to do Switch Sports.
[321:54.58]So like Mario Golf and Mario Soccer and Wii Sports Resort.
[321:59.93]This week I'm going to play some stuff on Monday.
[322:02.55]So that should be fun.
[322:04.43]I will probably do some more chill.
[322:07.64]Just hang out, play Oblivion streams after that.
[322:12.64]And then again, May 17th.
[322:13.96]Mark it on your calendar.
[322:15.36]May 17th is the House Flipper Invitational 3.
[322:21.13]It's officially there.
[322:23.71]Mark it.
[322:25.97]Trying to get 24 people.
[322:29.47]Already quite a few people have confirmed.
[322:30.92]So I think there's about 18 to 20 right now.
[322:36.72]The reason why this is going to be fun is it's going to be teams again.
[322:39.96]It's going to be 2v2.
[322:41.95]But it's coinciding with a co-op update.
[322:47.89]Looks like it's going to be crazy.
[322:50.73]Actually co-op.
[322:52.51]2v2, real time, building on the same map.
[322:57.12]That's the idea.
[322:59.02]And it's going to be really fun.
[323:03.15]May 17th.
[323:10.14]I genuinely just marked my calendar.
[323:12.06]Well, good.
[323:14.07]You should.
[323:17.03]That's in like two weeks.
[323:18.05]Oh, yeah.
[323:24.71]Thanks for hanging out though.
[323:26.05]Appreciate watching.
[323:27.42]Appreciate you chilling.
[323:30.22]There were some good ones tonight.
[323:31.00]There was at least three or four of them that were very good.
[323:33.20]Out of like the six we played.
[323:36.31]The next time we'll see you.
[323:37.19]No, I'll be live on Monday.
[323:38.67]Being Squeaks.
[323:44.18]Gary games are always fun.
[323:45.10]It's always fun to do the grab bag.
[323:49.16]I'm going to go get some dinner and I'm going to get some sleep.
[323:58.18]Do you have your noise gate on?
[324:01.08]I think it's cutting you off.
[324:03.36]Uh, I did it weird today.
[324:04.78]I'll revert it back to where it was before.
[324:18.84]What about the emotes?
[324:21.48]Yeah, there's been a couple that have been made already.
[324:23.63]They're just not, um, they're not implemented yet.
[324:26.83]I want like 20.
[324:35.77]20 new ones.
[324:42.12]There were a lot of subs tonight too.
[324:45.13]So, thank you guys.
[324:59.07]What about Monster Rancher?
[325:01.29]Yeah, that kept kind of going on the Backburner.
[325:04.66]And now a lot of my time is going into getting the house slipper thing ready.
[325:11.99]Because of the formats, I got it locked down.
[325:14.15]But there's a couple of little fun things I want to try to do.
[325:19.16]Probably going to do that.
[325:21.36]There's not that much that goes into that, though.
[325:23.30]I just have to get a handful of people.
[325:24.68]I already had people that wanted to do it.
[325:28.51]Hey, you should play League of Legends with Squeaks.
[325:32.27]No, I don't think so.
[325:37.69]I don't think that's what we're doing.
[325:46.52]Alright.
[325:46.74]Take it easy.
[325:47.26]See you later.
[325:48.95]It's late, but call your mother tomorrow.
[325:50.91]Or whatever.
[325:51.33]You get an opportunity, right?
[325:54.31]See you soon.
[325:54.71]Take care.
[325:55.18]Goodbye.
[325:55.78]Good night.
[325:57.12]See you on Monday.
[325:57.64]Don't have a start time yet, but probably somewhere in the early afternoon.
[326:02.57]Actually, no, no, no.
[326:03.07]I do have a start time.
[326:04.35]What did he say?
[326:07.17]He said... What time did he say?
[326:20.47]1 p.m.
[326:20.91]Pacific.
[326:21.33]1 p.m.
[326:23.41]PT on Monday is when we're going to do it.
[326:28.76]See you later.
[326:29.90]Goodbye.
[327:02.26]you
