[00:01.08]What?
[00:01.42]I'm trying to... I'm trying to do the thing.
[00:03.54]I'm trying to be a streamer.
[00:06.18]I'm trying to be a streamer that has an intro play from one minute to a minute.
[00:14.87]We talked about this, like, a few days ago.
[00:19.33]I'm trying to... Alright, listen to me.
[00:24.18]Everybody that you watch on Twitch... I want to get, like, an assessment, you know?
[00:30.97]What's the average starting soon screen time?
[00:35.07]I'm curious.
[00:35.51]No, this is important.
[00:41.12]What, 15 minutes?
[00:44.74]15 minutes?
[00:45.02]Okay, I'm seeing a lot of 15 minutes.
[00:48.52]10 minutes, 20 minutes?
[00:49.28]It's like 10 to 20 minutes?
[00:52.46]Okay.
[00:56.62]Zero minutes to an hour.
[01:02.78]Free stream chat is that for you?
[01:07.68]Well, my question is, so, if I'm late by 10 to 20 minutes, half the streams, aren't I just starting when most people would start usually after a starting soon screen?
[01:23.68]Thinking face, you know?
[01:33.86]No, because you don't wait for the notifications.
[01:35.42]Oh, shit.
[01:39.82]Am I right?
[01:40.54]You're right.
[01:41.10]No, you're right.
[01:42.34]No, I had to take it on the phone.
[01:43.90]Alright, so the last couple days I've had phone calls that have come in that are just like, well, you have to answer this or your life is going to fuck up.
[01:51.57]Okay.
[01:53.83]I'm going to answer that phone call.
[01:57.99]I've had like two answer this or else phone calls.
[02:03.06]In the last two days.
[02:09.74]No, it's not a scam caller.
[02:14.08]Those sound like fake calls to me.
[02:18.85]Anyways, how you doing guys?
[02:20.11]Welcome back.
[02:25.27]We're gonna play black and white again.
[02:29.25]As you see on the title and from the tweet.
[02:35.56]Where we left it last night is an actually pretty sad spot.
[02:41.22]Not a nice spot.
[02:44.65]Our new cow friend who we made last night.
[02:49.51]The cow's name, by the way, is Murius.
[02:51.95]If you were not part of the pre-stream chat.
[02:56.33]He's curious.
[02:58.00]He's a little furious.
[02:59.42]And he's a cow.
[03:00.90]You know, he's Murius.
[03:01.66]Murius.
[03:06.20]Furious Murius.
[03:09.18]You can also say Curious Murius when he's doing something that's not so mean.
[03:17.75]Mauled and Murius.
[03:22.63]-2.
[03:26.97]Hype Train Incoming.
[03:28.41]What the fuck was that?

[03:52.85]100% we did it, apparently.
[03:58.39]Hooray.
[04:00.05]Hype.
[04:02.57]I didn't, I don't know what that was.
[04:04.19]I didn't enable this.

[04:28.51]I don't know what the fuck this is.
[04:30.04]I swear to God.
[04:31.40]I was like talking about my cow.
[04:34.82]Wait.

[04:55.62]How many levels are there?
[04:57.52]No, there's three, there's more than three levels?
[05:00.34]Uh, level three hype train.
[05:08.60]Can I, I can click this button?
[05:11.90]Completing level three requires hype conductors.
[05:16.18]What the, what is a hype conductor?
[05:18.94]This is like a train conductor?
[05:20.26]A current hype train tops level three emotes.
[05:25.97]Wait, you're unlocking emotes?
[05:27.89]Like these weird train monsters?
[05:32.75]We just got to level 5?
[05:34.75]What level are we?
[05:35.53]Okay, hold on.
[05:37.63]I can't even keep up with how many people are subbing right now.
[05:39.79]Alright, you got more emotes.
[05:43.46]Thanks for the hype.
[05:46.26]Train.
[05:49.36]I don't know if we've been selected to test a new feature, but apparently we're testing it.
[05:54.36]Uh...
[05:56.58]Level four, I've trained.
[06:03.08]This, okay, at some point we have to get off of the train.
[06:08.46]Sub gift of, alright, let me see what this even is.
[06:10.85]It's supposed to be four.
[06:13.53]Oh my God, alright.
[06:17.13]Guys, I, it never stops.
[06:22.28]No, it has to stop at some, you can't ride a train this fast.

[07:01.28]Hold on.
[07:02.52]Hypetrain Twitch?
[07:05.08]I feel like I'm gonna get like a bunch of compilation videos.
[07:07.35]Hypetrain Guide.
[07:11.07]I can't fucking believe this is happening so close to the New Year's Eve stream.
[07:16.07]Hypetrain Incoming.
[07:18.27]Hypetrain is a super-sized celebration when community members unite to support a streamer that they love.
[07:23.89]Well, thank you guys.
[07:25.76]It challenges the community to reach epic levels of hype and rewards.
[07:31.20]But when did this start?
[07:36.37]Oh my fucking god.
[07:38.51]This is like... You've... Twitch, you've gamified hype meters now.
[07:47.12]Oh my god.
[07:55.19]So many subs and bits are coming in.
[07:57.93]I can't even fucking comprehend.
[08:00.89]We gotta go to the beginning here.
[08:01.99]I haven't even done an intro.
[08:07.77]Hype.
[08:08.41]You did it.
[08:11.11]Level 5.
[08:12.00]It has to stop somewhere.
[08:13.52]What does it say?
[08:15.76]What does it say for... Alright, you did it.
[08:20.28]You did a level 5 hype train.
[08:26.51]A hundred and thirty-five percent.
[08:30.36]There ain't going over this.
[08:34.32]One forty.
[08:35.08]Wait, what do you mean it doesn't stop?
[08:40.58]Well, there's three minutes.
[08:44.55]A hundred and fifty percent.
[08:47.41]You guys are fucking crazy, man.
[08:54.22]Well, that's an interesting feature.
[08:56.86]It just activates when... Holy shit.
[09:03.64]You guys don't even have to do this.
[09:05.48]You already unlocked level 5.
[09:06.44]You're at 175%.
[09:11.36]You don't even have to do this anymore.
[09:12.88]We've hyped ourselves into outer space.
[09:13.68]We did it.
[09:24.22]I just wish it wasn't called Hype Train.
[09:27.42]Because it does the hype thing at the top.
[09:30.75]Can I customize that so it doesn't say hype?
[09:34.43]Can it say... I don't even know.
[09:40.39]Almost 200%.
[09:40.71]Two minutes until this clock runs out.
[09:45.65]And I get subbed and gifted another two to three hundred times.
[09:53.72]Thank you, guys.
[09:54.40]I did not know this feature was even coming through, but just remember, I'm going to be very clear about this.
[10:00.36]The ridiculous, insane, like, top 30 on Twitch in sub-numbers, top 40 on Twitch in sub-numbers, and incoming money, I'm going to fucking use it.
[10:12.46]I'm going to use it for this stream.
[10:16.86]I promise you.
[10:19.23]A million percent.
[10:25.54]246% of this experimental feature.
[10:34.76]He's going to use it on cocaine.
[10:36.97]I don't do drugs.
[10:37.63]If I pissed in the Wii, I don't do drugs.
[10:42.95]It's a monumental task for me to even thank any of you.
[10:50.35]I could... It's so... It's so... This is like... It has to be one of the most generous, supportive communities on Twitch.
[10:59.31]It has to be.
[11:00.91]I can't even begin to tell you how much I can say thanks.
[11:05.75]Honest to God, it's... It has to be up in the top 20.
[11:09.86]Has to be.
[11:15.24]The hype train is at 333%.
[11:24.89]Get it to 420.
[11:25.91]400%.
[11:25.99]This is just shit you didn't even need to do.
[11:33.62]Here it comes.
[11:34.72]The clock is running out.
[11:36.40]350.
[11:38.75]Hype.

[11:43.83]Okay, now does the... Such strong support.
[11:46.55]Level 5 completed.
[11:48.13]Now what do you all get?
[11:52.16]182 subs and 24,000 fucking bits.
[11:55.76]What in the name of God?
[11:59.93]We're delivering emotes.
[12:02.25]Do you guys have emotes now?
[12:06.55]Great work.
[12:07.09]Emotes are being delivered to supporters.
[12:09.89]Hype Unicorn 3.
[12:12.45]What even are these?
[12:16.95]Can I customize those?
[12:22.70]Alright, if I can customize those... I'm gonna make them fucking... I can't, no.
[12:31.79]Mega Hype Cow.
[12:36.27]Once again, everybody, I can't even... My brain has trouble with this shit.
[12:42.01]Because I can't even fathom something like this happening.
[12:45.74]And...
[12:47.54]I just want, I just want to have fun.
[12:49.06]I just want, I just want us to have fun together as a group of people.
[12:53.04]I just want, that's it.
[12:53.84]That's all I care about.
[12:54.76]You know what I mean?
[12:55.38]Like, it's hard for me to even say thanks because I don't even know what to fucking do.
[12:59.17]It's just like ridiculous.
[13:00.99]I hope you fucking have fun.
[13:02.43]I really do.
[13:03.01]Let's, let's have some fun.
[13:07.27]Somebody give 20, FuriousBear 20 subs.
[13:09.91]We're going to, there's going to be a long outro tonight.
[13:14.49]I will tell you.
[13:15.65]Because there was $50 too.
[13:16.27]There's like $50 like five times.
[13:17.51]Holy shit.
[13:17.73]Somebody gave $100, $200 where?
[13:18.45]AV Joe gave 5,000 bits.
[13:21.61]They said keep going.
[13:25.70]So how does that even happen?
[13:26.34]Is it just random?
[13:42.21]Well, uh, Twitch, if you just released this and you'd like to get some, uh, beta feedback, uh, here it is.
[13:49.61]Like, there you are.
[13:52.25]You just got a bunch of it.
[13:57.29]Uh, but thank you, abjo5000.
[13:59.09]Oh my god.
[14:01.59]That's the loudest one of the year.
[14:03.43]Clip that one.
[14:03.97]That has to be the loudest room that's ever happened.
[14:11.66]Seriously, like, I won't even need a category.
[14:13.78]That was next to the window.
[14:17.46]Fitty, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[14:19.14]I'm pogging so hard right now.
[14:20.68]You guys are fucking too much.

[14:37.63]You know what I mean?
[14:38.29]Let's go.
[14:43.33]Let's do it.
[14:46.97]You guys should get fucking hyped for this channel.
[14:48.94]You should fucking feel excited for it.
[14:51.44]Especially considering we're about to play Black and White for like another eight hours.
[15:06.69]Oh, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
[15:10.57]No, but for real, for real, for real, for real.

[15:23.22]What's that thing?
[15:24.40]Oh, that's a tree.
[15:26.20]I need one of those.
[15:28.67]Yeah, let me put that over there.
[15:35.71]Adam laughing my ass off gave a fucking $100 right now.
[15:41.06]Thanks for the... Thanks for the 10,000 vids, dude.
[15:46.20]Well, that was an interesting first 15 minutes of the stream.
[15:52.92]We were in the middle of the intro.
[15:55.40]What were we talking about?
[15:56.12]I don't know, what were we talking about?
[16:00.56]It was something important, it was about the cow.
[16:07.03]Oh yeah, the cow's name is Murius.
[16:09.45]Murius.
[16:11.75]The cow, and everyone, I got a lot of shit for that name.
[16:14.51]People like, oh, furious, come on, like curious, furious, whatever.
[16:17.97]Yeah, yeah, but you know what the number one suggestion was last night?
[16:21.57]I looked over here and you know what it was?
[16:23.55]It's Mega Milk.
[16:25.46]So, um, I think my name might have been like a tad better than the number one suggestion.
[16:39.28]Alright.
[16:40.00]But, oh, that's right.
[16:41.10]Those of you that weren't here last night.
[16:43.28]We have a sad tale right now.
[16:45.72]I was going off on the sad tale on the intro.
[16:49.26]Uh, Mirrius was captured.
[16:53.23]And is being tortured right now.
[16:55.17]Over there.
[16:57.75]And we have to go save him.
[17:01.17]Pretty... Yeah.
[17:03.17]And that is what's happening.
[17:05.91]I am gonna go.
[17:06.55]I'm gonna build up the city.
[17:09.54]Somebody said last night, I'm going to take this to heart.
[17:12.12]They said in direct quotes, you can look at the logs, they said, LOL, he is not ever going to beat the third level because he didn't pay attention to one of the most important mechanics.
[17:24.66]So I'm going to beat the third level because now I'm ready.
[17:28.20]I'm going to make sure that I have shit ready to go.
[17:32.03]I'm going to pay attention.
[17:33.89]And I paid attention yesterday, too.
[17:35.35]But anyways, welcome back, everybody.
[17:37.71]Playing black and white again.
[17:39.77]Alright, so, we need wood.
[17:43.05]Oops.
[17:44.99]Okay.
[17:45.99]We need wood.
[17:48.26]Where's my wood center?
[17:49.96]Because these people are all... Here's my temple, right?
[17:52.30]Okay.
[17:54.22]I need some... There's my temple going up.
[17:56.90]Why is it so much louder?
[17:59.88]Oh, it's because I've opened the game.
[18:02.62]When you open the game, all the volume shit goes crazy.
[18:07.94]Music is... Where's the music?
[18:10.70]Should we be getting music?
[18:13.75]I think I broke the music by, like, turning it off.
[18:17.59]Alright.
[18:18.37]That's better.
[18:18.77]There we go.
[18:23.19]Cutting the trees.
[18:23.65]Now, how much wood do they need?
[18:24.49]Oh, I can just do this.
[18:25.09]I can help.
[18:27.50]Let's get this temple built.
[18:32.48]How much wood does it need?
[18:33.18]3,200.
[18:33.82]Why does it need so much wood?
[18:40.74]Bring back Mega Milk.
[18:43.74]Look, I'll show you.
[18:44.69]He's currently being tortured right now.
[18:47.47]You want to see this?
[18:48.29]You really want to see this?
[18:49.11]I can't do anything about this.
[18:53.72]There he is.
[18:55.66]But look at that will.
[19:00.44]Seems pretty chill for Toad.
[19:01.46]Well, it's because he's frozen in a weird ice thing.
[19:04.92]And by the way, this motherfucker is dead.
[19:08.10]Just wait till I train with Murius and bring him over here.
[19:10.56]See, look what he's doing.
[19:11.36]He's just, like, burning me.
[19:12.62]I gotta get over there.
[19:17.16]He's got his hands on his hips.
[19:21.49]We got a long way to go.
[19:22.39]For the saving of Murius.
[19:26.55]There's other towns over here.
[19:27.73]Alright, let's keep going.
[19:30.59]He does always have that Disney character.
[19:32.85]Hands on hips.
[19:35.55]Waving at people.
[19:37.79]Alright, we need 1,800 wood.
[19:39.41]Let's go.
[19:44.12]I need to replant some trees.
[19:46.28]I miss them already.
[19:47.26]I really do.
[19:47.70]Alright, we got it.
[19:52.80]We're good.
[19:55.46]Nice fax machine.
[19:59.07]I need to put wood over here.
[20:00.55]But this shit needs it bad.
[20:07.37]Did you know?
[20:08.57]Yeah, yeah.
[20:08.95]Okay, this is the store.
[20:09.83]Somebody... We gotta get a builder over here.
[20:12.74]How many of you guys are builders?
[20:14.28]What are you?
[20:16.38]Going to the forest for wood.
[20:17.60]No, no, no, no, no.
[20:18.38]Not anymore, you know.
[20:19.16]Come over here.
[20:21.22]We gotta get this shit built up.
[20:23.38]Resident builder.
[20:27.85]Deciding what to do.
[20:29.77]I can decide for you.
[20:31.17]Come here.
[20:34.68]Builders.
[20:35.80]Alright, we got extra wood?
[20:41.42]Wood?
[20:41.94]This is extra, right?
[20:42.80]Yeah.
[20:45.76]I think that person just fell off the cliff.
[20:49.94]Supply this shit.
[20:52.14]Alright, come on.
[20:52.92]Hurry up.
[20:53.30]I gotta, like, be efficient here.
[20:58.36]Wait, did I just... What?
[21:00.24]Oh, fuck.
[21:00.90]That wasn't done.
[21:12.07]Alright, alright, alright.
[21:13.41]This does not seem like a good idea.
[21:14.93]Where are they going?
[21:19.32]I think... Wait, what's this?
[21:20.38]Ooh!

[21:23.42]Nice.
[21:23.94]Alright, let's put it, uh... I'm gonna put it over here.
[21:28.89]Miracle of wood.
[21:29.83]Alright, I need 751.
[21:36.53]We'll just drop it in here.
[21:42.06]Oh, get on that hype train!
[21:43.42]Alright, somebody build it!
[21:49.38]Let's... What was that?
[21:59.61]Is this mine?
[22:02.51]I think all this shit is mine.
[22:05.72]Shut up about the hype train.
[22:08.46]I'm kidding around, don't worry.
[22:12.96]Alright, give me that rock.
[22:17.17]How much more wood does this need?
[22:19.29]Scaffold value 3?
[22:20.75]No, I mean, like, build it then.
[22:22.27]What's the holdup?
[22:22.67]Is it not buildable?
[22:30.53]He said he might have to wait.
[22:36.48]Rescue Mega Milk.
[22:37.50]That's the goal.
[22:38.96]That's not who that is, though.
[22:40.42]And I don't care if you keep calling him Super Milk.
[22:45.30]His name is Murius.
[22:47.82]And I will not call him the thing that you are calling him.
[22:53.12]Let's get a builder over here.
[22:54.07]No, no, no, no, no.
[23:01.16]Almost done?
[23:01.95]Good.
[23:03.93]Mega milk is easier to spell.
[23:06.75]It's also porn.
[23:09.47]From what I've been told.
[23:10.71]So, I... No!
[23:12.09]That's not what it is.
[23:12.87]What do you mean, no, it's not?
[23:22.08]It's not.
[23:25.48]It is.
[23:26.06]It's not.
[23:26.56]It is.
[23:27.16]Well, is it or isn't it?

[26:20.68]Actually, that's great.
[26:21.44]I'm actually really happy.
[26:22.54]This is perfect.
[26:25.14]Even if a rival god did this, I don't even care.
[26:28.30]You're helping me.
[26:37.00]Alright, we need people to work down here.

[26:59.87]I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[27:01.85]I'm sorry.
[27:02.55]Okay, he was trying to get up there to fix the orphanage.
[27:04.52]I got you, I got you.
[27:08.12]They can't get up here.
[27:14.78]See?
[27:15.32]It's in a weird, it's in like a fucked up spot.
[27:20.14]Can I move this?
[27:22.78]I didn't put this here.
[27:25.22]They can't get in.
[27:33.66]I don't think they can get in there.
[27:34.56]It's in a weird angle.
[27:39.17]Okay, well, I have Temple here.
[27:41.69]Alright, let's get the, uh... Is this thing almost done?
[27:46.83]Did they eat this person?

[28:17.41]Shitty pathing, dude.
[28:18.43]This is all wrong.
[28:19.39]I didn't even build this shit.
[28:20.65]This was given to me.
[28:21.87]I would have had a much better spot.
[28:24.93]Alright.

[28:45.00]I can make trees.
[28:47.21]Plus, I can steal them.
[28:48.55]I can take trees.
[28:49.86]From whoever I want.
[28:54.58]If the god next door is angry at me... Okay, now I need to do houses.
[29:02.66]You're a liar and a thief.
[29:06.40]I don't see any food mur... Alright, what's down here?
[29:10.31]Okay, here's the next town over.

[36:55.18]Oh, what are they doing here?
[36:57.98]Is this the worship site?
[37:00.58]It is, isn't it?
[37:01.16]Alright, finally.
[37:03.52]Took long enough.
[37:06.29]Build that site up.
[37:07.47]We need to pray... I'm trying...
[37:14.19]I'm trying.
[37:14.91]I need to make a food spell and... Do not get hit by that rock, please.
[37:20.85]Alright, are you done?
[37:27.93]Okay, here we go.
[37:29.53]Wow, you did it.
[37:30.55]Everybody, and I mean everyone.
[37:33.21]Everyone to the temple now, immediately.
[37:36.39]Drop everything you're doing and worship me.
[37:40.44]Tell me kind things.
[37:42.12]Tell me I'm smart.
[37:43.28]Tell me I'm fun.
[37:44.68]We're going to have to sacrifice a couple people too.
[37:51.17]Yeah.
[37:51.77]Yeah.
[37:52.19]Who's... Miracle food.
[37:54.29]Miracle food.
[37:54.99]Food!
[37:55.25]It's already gone.
[37:59.72]Miracle food.
[38:08.39]Oh my god, it's already gone, they're so hungry!
[38:12.43]I can't, it won't even show up on the ground.
[38:17.61]We have to sacrifice somebody.
[38:24.99]I seriously can't even get it to show up on the ground.
[38:30.01]Alright, somebody else has to die.
[38:32.25]Um... Yay!
[38:40.10]They're eating it instantly.
[38:42.24]Alright, who's dead?
[38:42.90]No.
[38:43.12]More.
[38:43.74]Alright, fill it up.
[38:45.76]Keep believing.
[39:10.00]Keep believing.
[39:10.62]Miracle food.
[39:15.89]Continue believing in me.
[39:21.63]I need better fucking... I'm gonna always be in need of food.
[39:28.46]More.
[39:29.20]How's everybody doing?
[39:30.66]We need food.
[39:31.60]I know.
[39:31.92]Uh-oh.
[39:34.64]Miracle food.
[39:39.74]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[39:41.34]One more, and then I'm gonna drop it down to like 30%.
[39:43.22]I'm gonna sacrifice one more person.
[39:54.10]Okay, that's good.
[39:56.48]I just dropped the food over here.
[39:57.38]Whoops.
[39:58.02]I'll get it.
[40:00.22]Back to work?
[40:02.71]Sacrificing people means less people that need to eat.
[40:05.89]This is true, but it also means I have to make sure that I'm not going to be unbreedable.
[40:15.98]I don't want to kill everybody.
[40:18.44]Alright, so now we'll still have these people there.
[40:21.42]Give me more food.
[40:23.20]They switch off, right?
[40:27.86]What do you mean unbreedable?
[40:28.88]Like, if I kill all the men in the area, if I kill all the women, then there ain't gonna be any more babies.
[40:38.05]That's what I mean.
[40:44.13]Alright, it's time to start growing influence.
[40:47.17]Everyone, how's everybody doing?
[40:48.23]Everyone okay?
[40:49.57]Going to sleep on the floor.
[40:50.93]Okay, now it's time for me to build... What are they doing over here?
[40:59.18]What is Geoff Keighley building?
[41:02.16]What is this?
[41:07.38]Is this a Game Awards arena?
[41:14.27]Maybe.
[41:16.21]He's building a statue of Kojima.
[41:21.35]What the fuck?
[41:25.83]Is this a house?
[41:26.57]Maybe they're doing that on their own.
[41:32.02]Alright, we're okay.
[41:35.34]I need to make a couple more houses.
[41:38.62]Another civic building.
[41:40.22]Alright, it's time to start ripping trees out.
[41:46.62]I need to build more shit over here.
[41:50.21]Because I need to spread into here and take this place over.
[41:54.77]I also need this shit, too.
[41:58.81]I feel like this building is not being used.
[42:00.73]Like, it can't be used.
[42:03.87]Oh, they are.
[42:04.21]They're making settlements.
[42:05.33]Look at you guys.
[42:09.55]Okay.
[42:11.25]Let's go over here.
[42:12.57]Let's get some more food.
[42:14.07]I'm going to get this to about 10,000.
[42:17.19]What's in there now?
[42:21.96]4,000.
[42:22.70]I'll do it like two or three more times.
[42:26.68]You already forgot about Mega.
[42:28.98]I did not.
[42:34.68]Hey streamer, just letting you know your facecam is on.
[42:36.38]Oh, how embarrassing!
[42:37.92]Alright, I need a ton more wood.
[42:44.70]Where is there a forest I can just rip out of?
[42:53.04]Save the cow?
[42:53.96]To save the cow, I need a strong enough base of followers.
[42:57.18]I can't just go save the cow.
[43:05.18]Damn it, I really need a bunch of more wood.
[43:07.26]Alright, let's zoom this out so I can see and just dump it into there.
[43:14.43]7600 wood.
[43:15.17]I need way more than that.
[43:17.21]I'll replace it.
[43:19.99]How much wood is in there now?
[43:20.73]8300, okay.
[43:21.15]I need like 20,000 wood.
[43:40.69]Because that's gonna help me build... ...more civic buildings, which is what I need, right?
[43:50.84]20,000 and I'm done.
[43:52.00]And then I'll plant a fake forest.
[43:54.62]I'll plant a magic forest eventually, don't worry.
[43:56.70]This is all gonna get replaced.
[44:09.07]Is that a rock?
[44:11.37]No.
[44:11.63]Alright, what is that?
[44:13.19]14,000?
[44:15.05]Not bad.
[44:16.13]Not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad.

[44:24.95]Only the ba- here we go.
[44:29.10]I keep hearing somebody scream.
[44:32.06]Who is this monster that keeps fucking screaming?
[44:36.04]Alright, let's do food again.
[44:44.82]Everybody's taken care of now.
[44:47.48]I'll do one more food.
[44:50.43]And then I'm out of trees and shit.
[44:52.73]I'm gonna have to do tree miracles, wood miracles.
[44:59.11]Your son is screaming in pain.
[45:02.58]My son's not a... Alright, let's start making shit.
[45:10.28]I need a civic building, right?
[45:11.38]I need three...
[45:18.23]There's two there already.
[45:24.17]I already have one.
[45:24.87]So what do I need to do to get... To get worshippers?
[45:31.77]To be able to help me... Move out and... Continue.
[45:36.14]I hope I'm trapped.
[45:39.50]I just need more people.
[45:41.08]Alright, well...
[45:49.38]I'm gonna do a big house.
[45:54.38]This is an abode.
[45:55.10]Alright, let's put this... I wish I could make another one of those.
[45:59.30]I'm gonna put this down here so people can farm easier over here.
[46:09.00]You know, we're gonna make these people over here the farmers.
[46:11.68]Workshop... Here we go!
[46:13.04]Alright.
[46:15.66]How do I cycle between what these are?
[46:20.94]Graveyard.
[46:21.60]Should I make a graveyard?
[46:23.96]For dead people?
[46:27.72]Would people like that?
[46:30.20]I need the graveyard.
[46:35.06]Should I make another... How do you cycle between this shit?
[46:38.04]Workshop.
[46:38.92]No.
[46:43.98]I don't have enough influence to go that way yet.
[46:45.78]How about down here?
[46:46.38]I'll do the graveyard down here.
[46:50.96]But it's not the graveyard yet.
[46:55.22]Make another abode.
[46:59.50]I gotta put that in a better spot.
[47:03.66]I wish I could make a farm over here.
[47:05.12]Alright, make another abode.
[47:11.75]Abode right there.
[47:13.05]And then another abode right here.
[47:24.22]Okay, so now people can actually live here and work here.
[47:27.34]It's four scaffolds for a field.
[47:31.64]Oh, fuck.
[47:32.60]Okay.
[47:35.35]Well, let's do that.
[47:36.19]Jupiter Storm, get down.
[47:57.31]So four, and I'll put another field down.
[47:58.93]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[48:01.05]I do need more wood, though.
[48:03.63]Fuck.
[48:07.32]This game's so fun.
[48:10.48]Alright, I need more wood.
[48:11.64]Let's do the wood miracle.
[48:12.64]What is it?
[48:13.00]This one.
[48:13.32]Here it is.
[48:14.92]I don't have a wood miracle.
[48:16.83]Uh-oh.
[48:18.23]Oh, that's very bad.
[48:24.17]That's very bad.
[48:27.68]Uh... I have to... This is very bad.

[48:44.41]Yeah, I did grab this.
[48:45.63]You're right.
[48:45.93]Okay, how much wood do you need?
[48:58.88]That's not a whole lot though.
[49:01.61]That's not a whole lot of wood.
[49:02.67]Alright, it's four you said, right?
[49:09.07]We need another field.
[49:12.69]Oh no, maybe I should start breeding the fuck out of everybody.
[49:15.13]What do you think?
[49:22.94]Pick up and replace the trees.
[49:36.16]Hold on.
[49:37.02]Should I just water shit?
[49:52.15]This is not like Stardew Valley, right?
[49:54.95]Hey.
[49:59.78]Ooh.
[50:09.86]Okay.

[50:38.29]Here we go.
[50:40.53]Field.

[50:46.37]Alright.
[50:46.75]I'm gonna put this right... I'm gonna put this over here.
[50:48.59]Because... This is too far of a walk.
[50:52.34]And then I'll put... I get to put like a new store building over there.
[50:54.56]Alright.
[50:54.72]I'm gonna put it right here.
[51:02.03]That's a long... I don't want that to be a long walk.
[51:04.33]Alright.
[51:05.43]Food is starting to become a surplus.
[51:10.62]I have to work on... What are you doing?

[62:42.73]And then what you don't know is your mother actually stays at the mall.
[62:47.50]And, like, sees where you went.
[62:49.80]And... Has the newspaper up and, like, looks over when you're going into fuckin', like, EB games or whatever the hell it is.
[63:03.82]And then she pulls up in the car where you're supposed to meet.
[63:06.20]Wait, what's that?
[63:09.33]What is this?
[63:17.87]Checkpoint.

[63:31.69]I don't understand.
[63:33.38]Hold on, he can see me.
[63:34.46]Am I just, like, peering in, looking at him?
[63:37.92]It's the hand?
[63:38.64]If he actually sees the hand.
[63:46.98]Oh, he's just skipping.
[63:48.55]He's skipping now.
[63:53.67]He's sliding.
[63:54.69]Wait, what's going on?
[63:57.41]Huh?
[64:00.13]Isn't he down here?
[64:06.01]Uh-oh.
[64:17.58]We may have got a game crash scenario.
[64:19.28]Hold on.
[64:24.59]Let it sit here for a sec.
[64:27.57]There we are.
[64:27.93]Alright.

[64:29.19]Stay away from him then.
[64:30.13]Jesus.
[64:30.53]What?
[64:40.39]What are you talking about?
[64:42.15]I'm sitting here looking at him.
[64:43.71]He's right here.
[65:03.87]What the fuck is going on?
[65:09.55]Uh... Okay.
[65:13.98]Okay, I think we'll come back to this.
[65:19.50]Is he walking again?
[65:25.97]Um...
[65:29.51]You followed me earlier.
[65:31.23]Please don't try it again.
[65:33.29]That is all.
[65:34.67]Okay.
[65:35.59]I don't know what... So is it the hand?
[65:40.22]It's gotta be the hand.
[65:41.34]Or is it my... Alright.
[65:43.00]So is it my point of view?
[65:45.10]Or is it just the hand?
[65:46.76]It's the camera.
[66:06.27]What the fuck?
[66:11.23]I- I'm looking all- I'm like peering over the edge here.
[66:16.95]What's she doing over there?
[66:18.15]I'm supposed to hide my face?
[66:20.04]How am I supposed to do that without losing him?
[66:27.94]Should I be down here?
[66:30.02]The camera's always going to be able to see him somewhere.
[66:32.94]Like, should I... But if I go... Alright, here he comes again.
[66:34.78]Alright, there he is.
[66:37.60]Okay, it's impossible for me to hide because I imagine myself being 500 feet wide as a face.
[67:02.14]Is he going to move?
[67:08.40]I think it's fucked.
[67:09.72]No, it has to start over again.
[67:10.80]Because remember, he has to go, ooh, you followed me.
[67:13.24]I'm going to try this one more time.
[67:20.07]Yeah.
[67:22.77]And it's going to glitch out for 30 seconds.
[67:24.89]Okay, so let me get this straight again.
[67:33.08]It's... Just... If I go too far away, he... They... I lost him, boss!
[67:38.77]But if I go too close, he can see my 500-foot-wide face.
[67:49.34]Stay above him?
[67:57.30]So, just, like, get... Float above him?
[68:03.62]Like this.
[68:05.00]He can't see me.
[68:07.60]He can't see me, right?
[68:16.41]He can't see the hand either.
[68:24.98]You followed me, so I'm going to... What the f... I'm huge!
[68:29.56]I'm huge!
[68:29.78]We gotta try again.

[70:30.15]There is no save game.
[70:31.11]It's autosave.
[70:31.79]Or you have to go into the temple.
[70:37.70]Oh fuck!
[70:40.30]We got a checkpoint, checkpoint, checkpoint, checkpoint, checkpoint.
[70:44.99]Checkpoint, checkpoint, checkpoint, checkpoint.
[70:46.43]By the way, saving the game crashes the game on Windows 10.
[70:48.97]That's what I was told.
[70:49.87]We're fine.
[70:50.49]We got a new checkpoint right here.
[71:01.52]You followed me earlier.
[71:03.24]Please don't try it again.
[71:05.30]That is all.
[71:07.98]Have you tested that once?
[71:10.10]No, I just believed what one person with negative two points on Reddit said.
[71:15.11]What the fuck?
[71:16.47]I didn't even start.
[71:17.33]I just had a cutscene.
[71:34.32]Yes, I did.
[71:35.14]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[71:39.80]Here we go.
[71:41.14]I have to wrap, I have to whip around him to the left side.
[71:43.94]What the fuck is going on?
[71:48.33]This is ridiculous.
[71:56.55]I think I can do it.
[71:57.17]I have to rip around to the other side of the building.
[71:59.27]Oh my god, give me a break.
[72:04.40]You followed me earlier.
[72:06.14]Please don't try it again.
[72:07.54]I have to go.
[72:08.34]I'm just repping away.
[72:15.65]Gosh, he's quick.
[72:17.07]He gave us the slip there.
[72:18.65]He's bound to be back at his temple later.
[72:29.42]You followed me earlier.
[72:31.16]Please don't try it again.
[72:33.20]That is all.
[72:34.27]Hold on.
[72:35.23]If I pull back a little bit behind the rock, I just have to zoom out.
[72:39.71]Here we go.
[72:42.89]Done.
[72:45.03]Don't... Jesus.
[72:52.90]Okay, here we go.

[72:56.40]Ah!
[72:56.48]It was coming in!
[72:57.70]What the...
[73:10.65]Why are we doing this?
[73:11.47]I don't know.
[73:11.85]There's probably a... I don't know.
[73:14.03]I don't know.
[73:16.17]Just kill him.
[73:16.79]No, we're so close.
[73:17.59]This is the second checkpoint.
[73:18.59]There's probably one more mushroom turn and that's it.
[73:27.52]Okay.
[73:28.28]But look at the... This is so odd.
[73:31.22]Is he done?
[73:32.84]Start walking.
[73:39.34]Okay, I have to rip the camera around.
[73:41.50]In fact, let's go over here.

[74:02.39]I'm under... Liar!
[74:03.53]What, do you see my hair?
[74:14.41]You followed me earlier.
[74:15.67]Please don't try it.
[74:16.79]That is all.
[74:17.35]Okay.
[74:24.48]You followed me, so I'm going back home now.
[74:27.60]I can't do this anymore.
[74:29.60]I can't do this anymore.
[74:30.68]I can't do it anymore.
[74:31.56]I can't do it anymore.
[74:32.74]I can't do it anymore.
[74:33.52]It's so finicky.
[74:34.56]It's so weird.
[74:35.38]It's so glitchy and sloppy.
[74:37.11]I can't do it.
[74:37.83]I can't.
[74:38.71]I'm so close.
[74:42.38]Okay.
[74:45.78]Zoom the fuck out quick and then come back in.
[74:51.03]And then the camera has to be behind him.
[74:55.13]So I have to rip the camera around his left side.
[74:57.73]I have to.
[74:59.18]Jesus, man.
[74:59.94]Even the tiny little... Is he going?
[75:02.84]He's going.
[75:04.28]He's going.
[75:16.53]Gosh, he's quick.
[75:17.95]He gave us the slip there.
[75:19.59]He's bound to be back at his temple later.
[75:24.37]This is so fucked up.
[75:28.31]You follow?
[75:28.85]Please don't.
[75:29.49]That is all.
[75:30.84]Why did I zoom in?
[75:31.66]I didn't.
[75:32.14]I moved the camera to the left and this terrain.
[75:35.62]So you go up, up, up.
[75:37.98]I'll ride a train.
[75:38.78]Gosh, he's quick.
[75:40.06]He gave us the slip there.
[75:41.66]He's bound to be back at his temple later.
[75:51.17]I did directly above.
[75:52.79]Directly above doesn't do anything.
[75:53.83]He sees you.
[75:54.23]You have to be directly behind him.
[75:56.14]But to be directly... This is like an RTS camera that I have to stick up this guy's fucking... I'm controlling an RTS camera.
[76:08.31]It's not like I could... I'm walking behind him in third person.
[76:30.50]Oh my god!
[76:34.18]You can't!
[76:37.12]You can't!
[76:42.21]There's a wall in the way and the camera hits the wall and points down.
[76:46.21]If I zoom out, it's gonna lose him.
[76:49.07]If I go across, it's gonna lose him.
[76:58.80]Stay below the ridge?
[76:59.70]I just did that shit and he saw me!
[77:11.04]Go lower than that.
[77:12.96]Watch this.
[77:14.14]Alright, fine.
[77:14.78]Let's go lower than that.
[77:17.30]Oh gosh, he's quick, isn't he?
[77:25.46]You followed me, so I'm going back home.
[77:27.88]Alright, all the chat detectives.
[77:30.36]All the fucking chat detectives.
[77:32.39]Go ahead.
[77:36.33]Do I get some slack?
[77:44.53]You followed me earlier, please.
[77:46.39]That is all.
[77:47.01]Keep your back to the cliff.
[77:47.83]I've done that three times.
[77:48.93]And every time the camera, because it's a fucking RTS camera, it hits the fucking goddamn side of the wall and goes down.
[77:56.32]I'm not doing that.
[78:17.77]See?
[78:17.99]Do you see what's happening?
[78:23.49]I can't even move the fucking camera.
[78:24.73]Alright, what do I do now?
[78:28.06]What do I do?
[78:28.48]What do I do?

[98:26.68]Hold on, pause the game.
[98:27.38]This camera's fucked up.
[98:38.51]So I gotta get up above there.
[98:47.83]These are not the same mushrooms from the video.
[98:53.16]What?

[99:39.06]Hold on.
[99:57.40]Okay.
[99:59.38]So, let's get to the starting point when he gets, where is it, right here?
[100:02.87]Okay, so there he is.

[100:20.50]Not close.
[100:21.06]Alright, let's go.
[100:21.98]I gotta go over here.
[100:30.36]I need to put this on my stream deck.
[100:31.90]Hold on.
[100:32.50]Because it'll be easier to switch back and forth.
[100:35.42]Lower my resolution.
[100:37.86]No.
[100:40.88]No, I'm not doing that.
[100:42.49]I play in HD.
[100:43.53]Let me just get this on my stream deck.
[100:54.23]Okay.
[100:54.73]There it is.
[100:59.53]So...
[101:03.52]Pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it.
[101:05.16]Okay.
[101:10.87]I can't see.
[101:11.51]I can't see what he's doing.
[101:16.31]Am I in the right spot?
[101:17.15]Kind of.
[101:27.42]To the left.
[101:48.71]Right, not left.
[101:49.41]I'm trying to look at two different screens.
[101:57.65]Why is the game different?
[102:08.75]That's pretty close.
[102:13.81]Okay, what does he do next?
[102:21.69]Jeremy, this is not content.
[102:24.29]This is not supposed to be.
[102:25.55]This is me trying to beat this stupid fucking childhood ruining dumb part of the game.
[102:34.68]I'm trying to win.
[102:39.16]What happens next?
[102:42.30]Okay, what does he do when he turns?
[102:47.66]I can't... I can't even fucking see what's going on.
[102:50.14]Alright, so he stays here.
[102:51.92]He then lowers the camera down to... Okay, I see where that is.
[102:59.19]Wait, can you guys see this?
[103:01.81]He lowers the camera down.
[103:03.69]And he starts... Okay.
[103:04.82]So he lowers... Do you see what happened?
[103:07.40]He low... Wait, why are you not getting this?
[103:18.95]Oh, I'm an idiot.
[103:19.69]I'm playing it in the other window.
[103:21.11]Not the one that's the browser source.
[103:22.31]Okay.
[103:23.71]So where does he go from here?
[103:25.57]Plus, this thing ain't even HD.
[103:33.65]Okay.
[103:37.95]So where does he move from here?
[103:41.25]So he dips down, right?
[103:43.37]Okay, he dips down.
[103:45.91]He's about to turn.
[103:47.27]So he's about to turn right there.
[103:49.31]Okay, do you see where that is?
[103:52.05]I'm gonna get it in the exact fucking spot.
[104:13.95]Is that good?
[104:17.33]It's like right there.
[104:18.49]A little bit more to the left.
[104:25.14]It's almost indescribable.
[104:38.12]Okay.
[104:40.13]It's tilted up a little and back.
[104:41.93]Yeah, it is.
[104:42.53]It's like this.
[104:48.74]I gotta be, like, tilted down and then this way.
[105:02.19]Okay.
[105:04.01]Like that.
[105:07.05]Okay, you can't tell me that that's almost fucking 100% the same image.
[105:10.95]That's the same image.
[105:19.78]Okay.
[105:21.28]So now, what does he do from here?
[105:28.32]Okay.
[105:29.93]Right when he turns, he dips down to there.
[105:33.53]Let's look at it one more time.
[105:43.56]There's the turn.
[105:44.74]He's now 100% turned.
[105:48.79]And then he dips down to there, covering himself.
[105:51.51]And that top part of that tree right there.
[105:57.04]Okay.

[115:16.18]I don't care.
[115:16.54]I was going to show all the comments.
[115:18.59]Everyone's being real nice.
[115:20.19]Alright.
[115:21.43]Unpause.
[115:29.41]Does he turn around again?
[115:33.51]Is this the end, or does he turn around again?
[115:36.49]Save the game.
[115:37.21]I can't, it might crash.
[115:43.83]Okay, let me just check the video.
[115:50.27]Check the video, check the video.
[116:10.83]Delete the video before he can beat it.
[116:12.49]Delete the video.
[116:13.85]Shut up.
[116:15.73]Do not even think about it.
[116:18.11]Don't delete this video.
[116:19.41]Don't delete this video.
[116:20.31]I need it.
[116:21.32]I need this video.
[116:23.36]Do not delete this video.
[116:31.62]It doesn't matter if he deletes it.
[116:32.66]I still have it in my queue.
[116:34.78]Alright, then he goes.
[116:39.34]He doesn't turn around again.
[116:41.46]You just have to stay behind him.
[116:44.98]There is more.
[116:47.02]How much more is there?
[116:48.64]Why is there more?
[116:49.92]There can't be more.
[116:57.46]No.
[116:57.86]I don't want to do more.
[117:03.58]Oh my god.
[117:11.28]Is there a checkpoint here?
[117:16.16]Is there a checkpoint?
[117:24.31]Fuck!
[117:39.48]But he goes, where does he go?
[117:43.67]Save the game?
[117:44.45]If I save the game and it crashes, I'm going to be fucking really mad.
[117:46.47]Alright, that's the end.
[117:48.67]Alright, if I save the game and the game crashes, I'm going to fucking be... I'm going to explode.
[117:54.83]Control-S?
[117:56.35]If I do this... Control-S?
[118:03.02]Don't.
[118:04.54]Do not.
[118:05.04]Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.
[118:23.29]Do it.
[118:24.55]Don't do it.
[118:34.31]Should I do it?
[118:41.57]Don't.
[118:45.31]So many people are saying no.
[118:48.48]It's too risky.
[118:51.73]What if I exit the game right now?
[118:54.76]Okay.
[118:56.84]If I exit the game right now, it's going to say no.
[119:00.86]Just stay behind him.
[119:11.73]Where does he come out from?
[119:12.65]Out there?
[119:14.85]Control S. Fuck, I am so... Now get over... It's over here, right?
[119:20.20]Not yet?
[119:20.80]I don't know.
[119:21.20]This is fucking horrible.
[119:22.24]I don't know what to do.
[119:30.52]Just carry him.
[119:31.14]Laughing my ass off.
[119:35.19]On top of the rock?
[119:38.05]What happened in the video?
[119:38.81]I hope you didn't delete it.
[119:53.62]It's not deleted.
[119:54.32]He didn't delete it.
[120:01.14]He goes under the rock.
[120:04.14]And then as he goes underneath... He's underneath mine completely.
[120:07.83]Alright, he's under the rock.
[120:13.31]You just stay above the rock and let him come out.
[120:17.53]Wait up here until... Okay, then when he comes out, you start to move towards him.
[120:23.85]Okay, I'll get there.
[120:25.09]Let's do that on mine.
[120:37.16]Where is he?
[120:43.57]Okay, and now he's almost at the top of that little hill.
[120:57.27]Okay, he's at the top of that little hill.
[120:58.89]Okay, now what does he do?
[121:01.43]Now what happens?
[121:03.15]He's at the top of the hill.
[121:06.05]Is he at the top of the hill on this one too?
[121:07.61]Now what?
[121:11.52]He bent.
[121:12.18]Okay.
[121:13.08]I see that little pit.
[121:14.18]What happened?
[121:23.51]He starts to turn this way.
[121:26.39]And he stays... He stays right here.
[121:29.85]He stays in this general area right here.
[121:35.98]So he stays, like, here?
[121:40.56]Like this.
[121:47.03]Like that?
[121:48.73]Right?
[121:50.69]Closer?
[121:57.11]Like, right there.
[122:07.84]Okay.
[122:11.98]And then, just please don't see me.
[122:25.29]Right, just stay here, right?
[122:39.27]I, I, okay, when he starts, what does that happen when he starts to move?
[122:41.94]When he starts moving, where do I go?
[122:48.38]What's wrong?
[122:56.71]I thought he deleted it.
[122:57.65]I'm so fucking glad you're not gonna delete it.
[122:59.23]Must resurg, resist urge to delete video.
[123:03.47]Okay.
[123:05.93]He looks, he looks, he looks.

[123:13.65]You go around to the right behind the tree.
[123:17.11]Okay, got it.
[123:21.54]So you go around this way behind the tree.
[123:52.23]Yes!
[123:53.35]Oh, fuck.
[123:55.87]Oh, that was horrible.
[123:56.79]Oh, that was horrible.
[124:05.49]So what?
[124:23.35]What did that do for me?
[124:29.30]Now kill him.
[124:31.74]I'll appear as needed.
[124:32.98]I don't get anything for that?
[124:35.36]I did it.
[124:50.41]Somebody said the description changed again.
[124:51.84]Read the comments.
[124:52.32]Alright, I'm going to go through the comments of this video.
[124:55.12]Sure.
[124:56.66]Jerma sucks, by the way.
[124:57.65]Let's see.
[124:58.23]Let's read it.
[125:00.02]Short streamer Jeremy Elberson needs guides to finish Boomer Game.
[125:02.87]More at 10.
[125:03.43]This is like, this guy ruined hours of this person's childhood.
[125:06.61]A thousand of us get it.
[125:07.85]Jeremy, you're short.
[125:08.69]Omega low.
[125:09.33]That's funny.
[125:09.79]5-1 Willem Dafoe needs tutorial to move camera correctly.
[125:13.15]That's hysterical.
[125:14.03]Jeremy couldn't get it right.
[125:15.15]Eh, you're right.
[125:15.83]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[125:17.99]This guy may be mauled on stream.
[125:20.12]Jeremy, walk.
[125:20.68]You can do it, Jeremy.
[125:21.38]This is a Jeremy985 partner channel now.
[125:24.16]I was here when he watched it.
[125:25.22]jermaVenus.
[125:25.92]Jerma be like, hmm, today I'll watch a tutorial live on stream and not save Mega Milk.
[125:30.38]This is painful.
[125:31.12]Annoying streamer ruins hours of his middle age.
[125:34.12]Thank you for this video.
[125:35.18]Jeremy would be banging his head against the wall without it.
[125:37.86]It's true.
[125:39.42]I can't believe Mega Milk died for this.
[125:40.94]Legendary.
[125:41.92]Heard that some streamer called Grillmaster.
[125:44.10]Whatever.
[125:44.84]Sudden change in description left me in tears.
[125:46.90]Jerma, you're handsome.
[125:47.76]Jerma's handsome.
[125:48.76]That's the same person.
[125:50.49]He did it.
[125:56.16]Let's read some of the comments from five years ago.
[125:59.46]Thank you.
[126:00.08]This is from five years ago.
[126:02.76]I never could beat that mission, so it's great to actually see it happen.
[126:06.98]It's kind of disappointing, actually.
[126:09.42]Okay, what about another one from like ten years ago?
[126:19.08]That's it.
[126:20.68]That's it.
[126:22.22]That's the only comment.
[126:24.94]Liar.
[126:25.44]Making up comments.
[126:26.18]Go read them for yourself.
[126:27.34]Sort by date.
[126:31.10]Let's go down to the end.
[126:32.32]Let's see.
[126:37.88]There's too many.
[126:38.62]Okay, a year ago, five years ago.
[126:40.88]That's the only two comments.
[126:41.84]Alright, hype train initiated.
[126:45.08]Alright, thanks for watching that, guys.
[126:47.10]Wait, did another hype train?
[126:50.28]Another hype train has been initiated?
[126:54.78]Wait, what's going on?
[126:56.46]It's not doing it again, right?
[126:58.13]No, okay.
[127:02.07]It's showing up on this other screen.
[127:07.49]It's showing up on my Twitch dashboard now.
[127:09.21]Alright, no, it's not.
[127:09.95]There's no hype train.
[127:10.79]Don't hype anything.
[127:12.85]Okay, welcome back to the stream, guys.
[127:17.36]That was fucking stupid.
[127:20.82]Let's, uh... Oh yeah, I had like a village that was starting.
[127:24.98]Let's go.
[127:28.92]How am I doing?
[127:35.34]Oh, I'm so glad I don't have to do that anymore.
[127:38.69]That sucked.
[127:40.29]That actually was the worst.
[127:42.97]What was I doing, though?
[127:44.97]This was an hour ago.
[127:46.15]I don't remember what I was doing.
[127:50.23]I was doing something important.
[127:57.59]I don't remember what that was.
[128:00.44]Breeding.
[128:01.02]Breeding.
[128:01.40]Right.
[128:01.66]Okay.
[128:01.94]But I want some more... Oh, wait.
[128:04.38]The forest isn't doing anything.
[128:06.16]He was saving... Murius.
[128:18.37]Get this out of here.
[128:18.85]This is gonna cause a problem.
[128:19.75]It's gonna hurt somebody, so get rid of it.
[128:23.63]Oh, right.
[128:23.97]I wanted to go take over the other village.
[128:25.45]That's not gonna hit a village, right?
[128:29.79]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[128:30.85]That's not gonna hit the... Good.
[128:32.26]Okay.
[128:34.42]Alright, let's make these people believe in me.
[128:36.12]What do you say?
[128:41.22]Let's give them some food.
[128:42.34]They look like they need it.
[128:45.16]What's the food symbol?
[128:51.00]I gotta move in to my territory and then out to these people here that I want to give it to.
[128:55.58]Let's get some influence.
[129:02.51]This camera's terrible.
[129:05.89]Come back over here.
[129:06.45]Alright, here we go.
[129:09.61]Ready?
[129:12.21]Oh, I don't have influence.
[129:13.05]I can't.
[129:18.81]Dammit.
[129:21.89]Welp.
[129:26.57]You need the immortal guy.
[129:31.56]How many belief do I need to take this over?
[129:34.38]419.
[129:37.56]Just make a new village?
[129:40.76]What, make a new village right down here?
[129:43.34]At the edge?
[129:45.54]Let me get this situated, though.
[129:48.17]What happened here?
[129:51.73]What happened here?
[129:57.15]Wood.
[129:57.39]Alright, what do we got?
[129:58.55]Any more?
[129:58.97]Yeah.
[129:59.80]Let's make another settlement down here.
[130:07.22]And it's time to breed.
[130:09.04]Let's get some children.
[130:11.10]Did the trees grow?
[130:12.00]They did not.
[130:15.71]They did not.
[130:20.19]Hmm, well.
[130:27.72]Time just to harvest them.
[130:41.41]Don't worry, we'll get him back.
[130:45.47]I can't believe I took that long to do that.
[130:47.59]There's a Miracle over here.
[131:05.30]Let's get that one.
[131:06.72]We can't believe it either.
[131:09.64]Well, that guy is apparently important.
[131:12.92]I can't just not do anything with that guy.
[131:15.63]Physical Shield.
[131:20.13]Well, I don't need that right now.
[131:32.89]Physical Shield.
[131:33.73]Alright, what if I give it to them?
[131:35.33]Here.
[131:40.35]Oh, well, I... How do I cancel?
[131:45.41]Can I drop this?
[131:46.03]I don't want to use this.
[131:48.34]I'm gonna sneeze.
[131:49.34]That couldn't mute.
[131:54.52]I don't want this.
[131:57.00]Drop?
[131:58.60]Press U?

[132:27.66]More children.
[132:28.34]Who else?
[132:43.31]Remember, you're hurting them.
[132:45.39]I'm not hurting anybody.
[132:47.55]I am not hurting anyone.
[132:55.42]I'm trying to get them to breathe.
[132:58.06]Disciple breeder.
[132:59.98]Disciple breeder.
[133:01.80]Thank you.
[133:02.26]Okay, children are starting to come out.
[133:06.00]We have enough place to live.
[133:09.82]Do need a little bit more wood.
[133:14.34]Which, there's some in here.
[133:15.96]And when that's done, I gotta go this way.
[133:25.42]Which way should I go?
[133:26.04]Is this the little area down here?
[133:30.14]Tons of trees over here.
[133:35.62]In fact, I'm gonna harvest them.
[133:37.74]I need to.
[133:52.39]Play music for the right mood?
[133:53.41]This is kind of the right mood.
[133:56.05]My buddy is gone.
[134:00.96]Alright, let's go.
[134:02.68]More food.
[134:03.60]Are people still worshipping?
[134:06.08]Yeah, they are.
[134:06.42]They're getting tired, though.
[134:17.53]12,000 food.
[134:17.97]11,000 wood.
[134:19.73]That should be enough for now.
[134:21.75]Have some kids.
[134:23.07]Breed.
[134:23.51]And then I have to make this town... I have to influence this town.
[134:27.10]What do you think?
[134:28.92]Maybe another little center here?
[134:32.62]Oops.
[134:33.10]I didn't want to do that.
[134:41.50]Need a lot more breeders.
[134:44.16]I mean, I kind of, but I don't want to do too much.
[134:48.22]What are they doing?
[134:49.20]Going home.
[134:50.72]Steve Jackson's going to sleep.
[134:52.81]We need more kids.
[135:03.05]Going to the worship site.
[135:04.09]Our population, seriously, is not doing so well.
[135:12.22]Going to the forest?
[135:17.00]Is this still not built?
[135:19.32]How the fuck is this not built?
[135:24.76]Everyone's like 70 plus years old.
[135:27.36]Better start having kids.
[135:35.23]Okay, build two more houses so people can live in these damn things.
[135:40.87]You were gone for 10 years.
[135:43.27]Yeah, well I had to figure out some things.
[135:46.98]Build it!
[135:47.24]Are there... What about the... Okay, let's go to the temple.
[135:56.68]This is about... Are there any women up here?
[135:58.68]I think so.
[136:06.79]Are there?
[136:07.07]Okay.
[136:10.69]We need some breeding.
[136:15.05]Breed.
[136:17.38]76 years old.
[136:18.26]I'm gonna have my first child at 80!
[136:24.24]Can I?
[136:24.66]Okay, good.
[136:36.66]We have to have kids.
[136:41.49]Start having kids before the whole village gets wiped out.
[136:47.73]68?
[136:47.77]85!
[136:47.85]Alright, well let's just... Wait, I think that was a... I think that was a female.
[137:04.49]Fuck, how old was she?
[137:05.51]I just like... Oh god, okay.
[137:08.53]Come here.
[137:09.93]What am I doing?
[137:10.63]I'm trying to make kids!
[137:12.05]Everybody's 80 and everyone's gonna die!
[137:17.71]Did you even read chat?
[137:18.83]What are you talking about?
[137:19.48]What are you talking about?
[137:26.80]The average age of people in this village is 75 years old.
[137:31.64]I have to make kids.
[137:35.82]Use a pregnancy miracle.
[137:36.98]I don't have that.
[137:39.88]You're talking about stuff that's potentially like six levels into the game.
[137:55.42]All these kids are gonna be messed up?
[137:58.04]Why?
[137:58.44]Are they having kids?
[138:01.16]Alright, get in the temple.
[138:07.49]I need to see what's going on here.
[138:08.37]I need a better picture.
[138:09.35]Uh-oh.
[138:26.81]percent male there are 222 people more than an insane majority of men breeders this is bad okay what is my what's my creature have to say
[138:58.27]I'm greedy.
[138:58.79]I'm tired.
[138:59.28]I think my God's on the good side.
[139:00.54]What do I think about creature Chugworth?
[139:04.56]He is totally evil.
[139:08.82]Who is- is Chugworth the guy torturing him?
[139:12.72]This guy torturing me is totally evil.
[139:22.67]Chugworth is such a cool name.
[139:25.45]What's... Murius.
[139:27.66]Murius is a good name, too.
[139:28.92]Let's take a look at this.
[139:36.00]Alright, I gotta start influencing, because... I wish I just had my guy, you know what I mean?
[139:42.10]If I had my guy, I'd be fine.
[139:44.74]But I don't.
[139:45.16]Alright, get me out of here.
[139:52.97]No, no, no, no.
[139:54.23]Get me out.
[140:02.14]Well, you could influence or you could follow a yogi for 60 years.
[140:07.81]But that's probably going to come back to be a good thing.
[140:11.29]I would assume.
[140:11.85]It has to be, right?
[140:16.97]Alright, time to build.
[140:18.15]I need some wood.
[140:19.43]I need to build like a... What should I build?
[140:21.35]Like a new town center down there?
[140:25.02]What do you think?
[140:29.82]What should I put down there to put some influence?
[140:41.23]Almost out of wood.
[140:42.73]There's no kids either.
[140:46.24]Alright, I have to use the actor.
[140:52.63]Where is he?
[140:54.91]Come here.
[140:58.29]Look at what I have.

[143:24.94]Cool, huh?
[143:26.34]I'm trying to grab him.
[143:27.28]He's not worth it?
[143:29.96]He is, because he lets me interact with his talent.
[143:48.98]You didn't kill me!
[143:50.21]Alright, how much did I get for that?
[144:01.73]251.
[144:01.81]I think I have to kill somebody.
[144:05.01]Where'd he go?
[144:09.60]Oh, please don't pick- Please don't throw me!
[144:16.52]I'm gonna hit somebody with this.
[144:18.07]Eventually.
[144:20.11]That's a new line.
[144:23.17]Put him on the sacrificial altar.
[144:24.63]Hold on.
[144:25.05]Put one of your guys in the village?
[144:30.05]Alright, well I have to put... Alright, here we go.
[144:34.87]Who am I putting in there?
[144:36.62]Um... You!
[144:37.92]Look!
[144:43.08]Look!
[144:45.08]Somebody from my village.
[144:46.42]What did I just do?
[144:49.38]Did I just make him... No, no, no, no, no.
[144:54.43]Don't... I want to... What does that mean?
[145:01.09]Is he like a... Did they just capture him?
[145:10.41]Did I make him into wood?
[145:11.63]No, I didn't.
[145:12.53]Look, he's like talking.
[145:16.28]I think he just... Did he just breed?
[145:17.50]Wait, where is he?
[145:27.15]Is that them?
[145:27.57]Oh, it is.
[145:31.65]He's going around.
[145:32.59]He's breeding.
[145:35.59]Right?
[145:41.38]Yeah.
[145:44.90]I infected them.
[145:47.27]Where's he going?
[145:50.65]Alright, I still need... Let me go back to my town.
[145:52.51]I have a lot of food.
[145:59.14]Um... Okay, let's build.
[146:01.34]What do I want?
[146:04.30]There's a fucking shitload of food.
[146:07.58]Okay, bigger house, civic building.
[146:10.10]What should I do?
[146:12.58]Should I do a new village center?
[146:17.36]Or should I just do another place to live?
[146:21.30]The soccer field is broken and it does not work, apparently.
[146:24.42]Make a graveyard?
[146:27.75]Change him to a missionary.
[146:29.33]Hold on.
[146:32.47]Where's my guy that I throw to be able to interact?
[146:40.32]Please don't throw me.
[147:02.34]Okay, we're in, we're in.
[147:08.65]So where did my, where did my guy go?
[147:12.95]Is he just in here breeding in the village still?
[147:15.55]Alright, I'm gonna make a missionary.
[147:20.55]Alright, I can't, I have no access to this now.
[147:29.44]Oh no, there he is!
[147:31.80]Wait, what are you doing?
[147:34.64]I don't have enough influence over there.
[147:38.22]Fuck, you gotta stay over here.
[147:44.81]So, this is weird.
[147:46.35]I don't think, this is the kind of dumb way to do this.
[147:50.25]I have to just build down here.
[147:53.94]Because I can't put him over there unless I have access to be over here, which I don't have access to be over here.
[148:00.24]Oh, you big bully.
[148:01.98]Try it again and please don't throw me.
[148:04.56]Like, this guy has to be standing in this village.
[148:07.44]My leg!
[148:08.24]Okay, I have to grab somebody and put him in here.
[148:17.86]Because I cannot do anything in this town unless there's... Pause it.
[148:22.01]I'm pausing it.
[148:24.83]I'm cheating the system right now, essentially, is what's happening.
[148:29.04]Alright.
[148:29.82]You.
[148:30.22]Geoff Keighley.
[148:33.83]Geoff Keighley, you are now going to be a missionary.
[148:39.55]What does it look like?
[148:40.41]Over here?
[148:41.07]On the temple?
[148:42.45]On their temple?
[148:43.93]They don't even have one, do they?
[148:51.53]On top of a person.
[148:59.89]Does it have to be a person?
[149:01.67]Because the breeding is next to a house.
[149:05.97]Okay.
[149:10.93]God damn it.
[149:17.60]Like, this guy has to be over here.
[149:20.38]Like, what the fuck?
[149:25.64]Ouch!
[149:33.75]OK.
[149:35.59]OK, Geoff Keighley, come here.
[149:43.98]So was that like Zen symbol, correct?
[149:49.10]Could I do it here?
[149:54.34]There he is.
[149:55.78]He's going to change.
[150:04.09]What is going on in here?
[150:10.09]Alright, Geoff Keighley is... Is now... He's a missionary.
[150:15.35]Okay.
[150:17.21]I still need 226 belief.
[150:19.72]Flying, flying, flying.
[150:22.02]What happened?
[150:23.70]What did you guys do?
[150:24.66]That guy died.
[150:29.62]What did they do?
[150:30.32]I can't even help them.
[150:35.74]Jesus!
[150:36.24]Alright.
[150:37.02]Alright, I got a missionary.
[150:42.38]I gotta go back to my town.
[150:43.40]I'm gonna build something down here.
[150:49.96]How we doing on kids?
[150:52.07]Very important.
[150:55.91]Fuck, somebody else died.
[150:56.83]Do we even have any children?
[151:07.27]I don't think there's any kids.
[151:08.47]Is it no kids?
[151:18.60]I gotta get some breeding done now.
[151:21.75]You need... Women have to be 45 or under to breed.
[151:24.47]Well, this town's gone.
[151:36.29]Hopefully Geoff Keighley does something over there.
[151:39.61]Otherwise, this is actually fucking ruined.
[151:45.72]Everybody's 80!
[151:47.76]Oh no, it's over.
[151:51.36]Steal people from the other village.
[151:52.58]Everyone over here is fucking ancient too!
[152:05.68]Everybody, look at how old everybody is.
[152:08.53]60, 50, 60, 60, 70, 70, 70.
[152:09.47]Why are we so old?
[152:10.79]20.
[152:12.41]Okay, hold on.
[152:16.19]Give me a break.
[152:17.13]Come on.
[152:19.90]This dude's gonna die of old age.
[152:23.38]I gotta get him over... Ugh, this sucks.
[152:26.58]I spent 60 years following the stupid guy on the cliff.
[152:33.79]Oh, help.
[152:36.23]Oh, God.
[152:47.74]No.
[152:50.08]You didn't kill me.
[152:51.18]Please don't throw me.
[152:53.18]Where the fuck am I?
[152:59.21]Speaking of missionaries, time to go find some people to bring back to my town.
[153:04.59]And, I don't know, I guess... Ouch!

[159:04.13]I need to steal more people!
[159:07.29]I have to do it before this guy dies.
[159:17.18]Oh, my head!
[159:28.96]It takes a minute to give birth.
[159:30.08]OK, let's get another.
[159:31.08]You didn't kill me.
[159:33.52]46, 85, 23.
[159:34.30]This place is vacant.
[160:01.12]What's wrong with it?
[160:01.60]Does it need to be repaired?
[160:03.04]What are you talking about?
[160:03.84]Live here in peace.
[160:10.78]Okay, now you breed.
[160:25.31]Disciple breeder.
[160:26.69]Okay, good.
[160:28.67]One more.
[160:29.55]I need another female.
[160:38.37]Oh, I think I broke it.
[160:41.63]Okay, this is it and this should be fine.
[160:51.91]God damn it.
[161:04.61]Oh, you big bully.
[161:06.37]Try it again and you're dead.
[161:08.17]Okay, we need one more person.
[161:10.17]60, 60.
[161:10.21]23.
[161:11.97]Wow!
[161:12.21]Whoa!
[161:31.79]Dead?
[161:32.21]Looks like the spot for you to move in.
[161:33.47]Alright, breed.
[161:51.25]Breed.
[161:56.09]You too, breed?
[161:57.11]Breed?
[161:58.13]Breeder?
[161:58.41]You're already a breeder.
[161:59.01]I need... Giving birth!
[162:03.40]Yes, our first child!
[162:06.84]Yes!
[162:14.42]Don't kill them!
[162:15.26]I just... Don't kill them.
[162:17.90]Don't die.
[162:18.26]Don't be dead.
[162:19.46]Don't be dead.
[162:19.86]I need... I need a fucking...
[162:31.51]These are the only people in the town.
[162:33.85]Okay, I need one more person.
[162:37.68]Live here and laugh.
[162:40.08]I need another male.
[162:43.12]Oh my god, I fucking can't believe I have to do this.
[162:44.78]Is there any people over here?
[162:46.38]70, 70, 70, 60, 60, 60, 80, 80.
[162:46.56]No, they're all gone.
[162:47.18]What about over here? 24.
[162:59.85]Convert the village?
[163:00.67]I mean, I can't unless I can't get over there for long enough.
[163:06.29]I think it's going to be fine.
[163:12.83]Everybody over here is going to be a breeder.
[163:14.07]There it is.
[163:14.67]Okay, 24, 24, 1, 1.
[163:15.07]Okay, we're having births.
[163:24.13]24.
[163:24.21]Breeder.
[163:24.63]Alright, you... No more of that.
[163:26.73]You breed.
[163:28.06]No more... No, no.
[163:29.42]You're 74, actually.
[163:30.40]You keep... You do that.
[163:31.28]That's fine.
[163:32.90]I don't want you doing that.
[163:33.76]I want you breeding.
[163:35.48]And that's it.
[163:43.74]Good.
[163:44.16]Good.
[163:58.41]Breeder, breeder.
[164:00.53]Good.
[164:01.67]73.
[164:02.61]Going home.
[164:04.31]Okay.
[164:06.53]I'm pretty sure everybody is now breeding with each other.
[164:09.87]Remember, the old can also breed.
[164:13.98]I thought you guys told me they couldn't.
[164:22.44]Disciple breeder.
[164:27.23]trying to make offspring.
[164:38.92]One guy killed the colony.
[164:43.10]Yeah, because I had to follow around this dude.
[164:47.12]Which, by the way, if I'm supposed to follow that person around, that takes 10, 20, 30 years.
[164:51.47]Well...
[164:59.02]Going home, going home, giving birth.
[165:00.44]Okay, we got another baby.
[165:02.26]I think we're gonna be in the clear for a while.
[165:05.54]You don't go to the forest for wood.
[165:07.78]Only breed.
[165:10.64]No one do anything else but breed.
[165:13.34]Anything.
[165:23.02]Okay.
[165:25.75]Don't do anything but have children.
[165:29.66]There we go.
[165:30.04]Alright.
[165:33.94]I think they will populate themselves now.
[165:38.66]We need wood.
[165:39.22]There's some down here.
[165:51.49]They're all gonna have the same birthday.
[165:57.76]It's pretty fucked up.
[165:59.22]That's pretty fucked up.
[166:02.41]Yeah.
[166:03.27]Yeah, it's fucked up.
[166:15.45]Heal the villagers.
[166:16.25]They're all under 50% health.
[166:32.89]Okay, one more?
[166:43.58]Over here?
[166:47.28]Nobody's worshipping, right?
[166:50.02]No, they can't.
[166:57.77]They can't, because they need to breed!
[167:06.92]Make them have s- no.
[167:10.28]Having children?
[167:11.82]Breeding?
[167:15.56]I see a lot more names, that's good.
[167:18.99]More kids.
[167:25.23]Good.
[167:27.91]Good, good, good, good, good.
[167:28.83]That's what I like to see, more.
[167:31.02]I need to do another heal though.
[167:32.26]What do I- how do I get another heal?
[167:37.86]65%.
[167:38.30]Someone's gotta go up here.
[167:40.32]Okay, is there anybody that's over the age of 60?
[167:52.49]Alright, who needs health?
[167:58.25]You guys down here.
[167:58.85]90, 40, 70, 60, 70, 70.
[168:11.96]75%.
[168:12.06]Alright, that's good.
[168:12.92]Alright, everyone's okay.
[168:16.78]We're good.
[168:22.24]Maybe I should steal some more people?
[168:29.21]The actor... He's dead.
[168:32.75]Alright, what do they got?
[168:33.53]49... 10... 10...
[168:42.55]Okay, there's somebody 38.
[168:43.93]I can't... I need 78 belief.
[168:48.57]Alright, let's just go trash the place until they love me.
[168:50.41]You know what I mean?
[168:54.77]Let's just trash the place until they like me.
[169:07.62]No!
[169:08.08]Don't crash.
[169:08.72]I'm not doing that again.
[169:12.65]You didn't kill me.
[169:14.31]Please don't throw me.
[169:15.95]Alright, look what I can do, guys.
[169:18.23]You didn't kill me.
[169:24.25]Cool, huh?
[169:26.29]Get off.
[169:26.93]Get off me.
[169:28.21]Oh, hell.
[169:30.13]I wonder if he's going to die of old age.
[169:33.70]There's got to be a... Come on.
[169:34.66]I need like 20 more.
[169:37.84]Look, the miracle of something.
[169:42.95]12.
[169:43.65]That's a kid.
[169:51.02]Put the kid down.
[169:53.74]Alright, how much more?
[169:54.42]32?
[169:54.68]Oh, god damn it.
[169:58.41]Where is he?
[169:59.39]Stop running away!
[170:10.74]Miracle of throwing the same guy into the ground.
[170:12.61]I know.
[170:13.55]Why am I throwing this person?
[170:14.47]Because it gains belief points.
[170:20.19]Do you believe me now, please?
[170:28.95]Once I have this village, I'll be good to go.
[170:32.09]Heal the actor.
[170:35.92]Okay, here we go.
[170:39.42]How much money do I need?
[170:41.02]How do you not believe me yet?
[170:53.17]Are you having fun anymore?
[170:56.15]I still am, strangely enough, after all this nonsense.
[170:59.01]Alright, let's go.
[170:59.69]How much more belief?
[171:01.43]31 belief?
[171:09.50]Oops!
[171:10.14]Catch!
[171:10.45]Catch!
[171:11.03]I got it.
[171:11.31]Okay, I'm fine.
[171:13.35]Please don't throw me.
[171:15.65]Okay, time to do a miracle.
[171:16.47]Oh, my head.
[171:21.69]Miracle time.
[171:23.07]Uh, heal.
[171:25.58]Oh, you big bully.
[171:27.40]Please don't throw me.
[171:29.32]Oh, you big... Please don't throw... Ow!
[171:32.44]I just need like 30 fucking... Oh, yi-yi-yi.
[171:40.09]Oh, you big bully.
[171:41.81]Try it again and you're dead.
[171:48.87]Believe!
[171:51.38]Believe!
[171:51.88]Oh my god.
[171:54.76]Please don't.
[171:55.54]You didn't kill me.
[171:56.76]Please don't throw me.
[171:59.26]Oh, you big bully.
[172:00.54]I don't have any miracles.
[172:01.18]Please don't throw me on my head.
[172:04.56]I can't wait to never have to throw this guy again.
[172:09.19]I have to just deposit food over here.
[172:13.25]Got it.
[172:13.51]No I didn't.
[172:14.29]Oh my fucking god.
[172:40.25]Where is he?
[172:49.98]Please don't throw me!
[172:51.60]You didn't kill me!
[172:53.80]Please don't throw me!
[172:58.81]I don't want to hear this dude ever again.
[173:04.11]I need 20 belief.
[173:05.35]I've given them food.
[173:07.23]I've thrown people.
[173:08.01]I've destroyed things.
[173:10.45]And I... How do I get this?
[173:13.25]Just 20 fucking belief.
[173:16.38]Save the cow.
[173:18.98]Do you understand the cow is across the entire game?
[173:35.05]I can't even... I can't get over there.
[173:36.49]I have to...
[173:47.06]This is somehow taking more time than following the yogi around.
[173:52.47]Doesn't building get you more influence?
[173:56.41]That's what I thought too, but I don't know how much... I'm gonna try building one building over here.
[174:04.46]Just give me the fucking thing.
[174:11.37]Right at the edge.
[174:16.89]Somebody build the damn thing.
[174:19.95]Build that.
[174:21.45]Because I can't do anything over here until I have... Sacrificed somebody for a miracle?
[174:31.99]I... God damn it, man.
[174:34.34]Look at all these children.
[174:42.59]The problem was following the yogi.
[174:44.67]Following the yogi was the dumbest thing to ever do.
[174:46.95]It just deleted 60 years.
[174:55.70]Walking behind... I had save points and shit.
[174:59.12]That took like 70 fucking years to walk behind that guy slowly.
[175:10.30]I'm going to sacrifice somebody for a miracle.
[175:15.82]Destroy a house in their village with a rock.
[175:22.06]I tried to throw a tree at their wall.
[175:24.65]Alright, give me a rock.
[175:27.27]Fuck it, let's go.
[175:27.93]I don't even know where that went.
[175:35.47]I have no idea where that just went.
[175:39.00]I need the actor again to do that.
[175:41.11]Oh my god.
[175:41.97]He's gonna die of old age.
[175:49.26]This is so stupid.
[175:51.88]Do you have a rock in your village anywhere?
[175:54.85]I need a boulder.
[175:55.59]God.
[175:55.71]Fuck you.
[175:55.89]Finally.
[175:56.41]Jesus.
[175:56.61]God.
[176:25.37]You didn't kill me.
[176:33.78]Look, when we took control of that village, one of the pillars fell.
[176:37.40]We almost have our cow back.
[176:41.80]All this pain.
[176:42.28]If we manage to keep control of it, I reckon it'll stay down.
[176:46.60]There are two more pillars and two more villages.
[176:49.88]It's clear to me we should take those villages, leader.
[176:55.34]Alright.
[176:57.22]God damn it.
[177:00.06]My influence has grown.
[177:01.46]Now, let's do this.
[177:05.05]Everybody.
[177:05.99]Everybody start working together.
[177:08.29]How we doing?
[177:10.79]We have another village over here.
[177:11.83]I have influence right there.
[177:14.29]We need breeding now.
[177:17.69]Breed together.
[177:23.21]What's going on?
[177:27.14]Your ally is dead.
[177:28.96]I have your creature, and you still dare to oppose me?
[177:33.58]I see some of your minions have strayed.
[177:35.66]Behold my wrath!
[177:55.21]What?
[177:57.97]No.
[177:59.75]I- I can't let this happen.
[178:02.15]I don't have a water spell.
[178:03.33]I don't have a water spell.
[178:04.75]There he is!
[178:07.31]Save us, please!
[178:08.10]Please, you took all of- That's all you're gonna give me is two water miracles?
[178:10.70]Thanks for nothing.
[178:35.25]Stop lighting each other on fire!
[178:38.29]They're reigniting each other!
[178:46.51]Okay.
[178:55.27]We good?
[179:06.34]Vagrant?
[179:07.38]What?
[179:09.69]Okay, so did I just get a shitload of people?
[179:11.83]Oh my god, they're all 18.
[179:13.23]Oh my god, they're all 18.
[179:14.65]They're all 18.
[179:15.25]They're all 18.
[179:16.45]All of them are 18.
[179:17.85]I just broke something.
[179:25.03]That just saved everything.
[179:27.70]Oh my god, they're migrating everywhere.
[179:29.06]Okay, here we go.
[179:30.58]Saved.
[179:32.44]Saved.
[179:34.55]Yes.
[179:35.75]Yes.
[179:36.05]Alright, we need breeders.
[179:39.25]Let's go.
[179:40.65]Chop-chop.
[179:42.23]Start having kids.
[179:48.24]No, don't kill anybody.
[179:53.82]Just start working.
[180:02.87]Farmers.
[180:03.95]Get a couple of builders.
[180:06.65]Why are they 70?
[180:09.35]Oh, it's Geoff Keighley.
[180:17.32]54, 2, 53.
[180:17.60]Okay, we need breeders.
[180:19.12]I need all the young ones to breed.
[180:22.53]And all the old ones to work.
[180:33.33]That mechanic.
[180:34.33]Seriously.
[180:35.15]Give me a break.
[180:37.65]Breed.
[180:42.03]What the hell do you think I'm doing?
[180:53.30]He's already a breeder?
[180:54.24]What?
[180:54.44]Alright, where are all the 18-year-olds?
[181:00.38]Going to building site.
[181:01.40]No, no.
[181:01.82]You should be breeding.
[181:08.25]You should be breeding.
[181:09.07]Any women?
[181:11.18]Oh, is this a woman?
[181:23.75]Disciple breeder.
[181:29.75]Disciple breeder.
[181:31.37]More.
[181:35.25]Okay, breeder.
[181:36.73]18.
[181:37.01]Going to building site.
[181:37.95]No, no, no.
[181:40.63]Okay, that should be enough.
[181:42.57]Now we have to have some woodcutters.
[181:45.15]My influence has grown this way.
[181:50.79]Any, uh... Is there any women over here?
[181:55.11]78.
[181:56.17]19.
[181:56.19]Going to the store.
[181:57.21]Okay.
[182:01.67]This town is in trouble.
[182:03.43]Ooh, hold on.
[182:07.27]Yeah, that's fine.
[182:08.57]Woodcut.
[182:10.41]Alright.
[182:13.12]Looking good.
[182:17.00]There's this other town over here.
[182:18.28]The influence is at least close enough where I can... Alright.
[182:22.22]Here we go.
[182:23.26]It's time to put some people on that side.
[182:24.70]Let's get some missionaries.
[182:29.02]You.
[182:31.93]Well, you're bad at chopping trees.
[182:33.45]Really bad.
[182:36.24]Come over here.
[182:37.24]Spread our good word.
[182:43.74]Missionary?
[182:45.24]Let's get a few over there.
[182:48.80]No one's working over here anymore.
[182:59.60]You too.
[183:05.99]462 belief needed.
[183:08.98]Did that just tick down?
[183:10.36]Or... I don't understand.
[183:15.10]Quiet.
[183:16.76]Alright, good.
[183:23.41]We're working in the fields here.
[183:25.11]How much wood do I... I got plenty of food, but I need more wood.
[183:31.20]You know, there's a whole forest down here.
[183:35.61]I need, like, a woodcutting shop.
[183:36.95]Look at all these kids.
[183:38.43]Perfect.
[183:45.87]Alright.
[183:46.61]Building site, sleeping... I think we can take some people away now.
[183:53.26]You... We need to start cutting this shit down.
[183:57.80]We have to make some people do some work over there.
[184:06.29]Building site, no.
[184:07.64]All the 55+.
[184:08.08]You're over here getting wood.
[184:10.56]55+, where are you?
[184:15.74]Okay.
[184:16.64]Anymore 55+. 79.
[184:34.92]Jerma, what the fuck?
[184:35.68]This is dystopian.
[184:43.64]What are they doing down here?
[184:44.56]Somebody died?
[184:45.04]Oh, no.
[184:48.99]Geoff Keighley's going to the farm.
[184:54.71]No!
[184:55.23]Catch them.
[184:56.77]It's okay.
[184:57.43]Breed.
[184:58.15]No.
[184:58.71]Cut wood.
[185:06.07]They're going a really long way to bring that wood.
[185:09.35]Okay.
[185:10.29]We're going to start to need food and shit.

[210:22.85]Are you kidding me?
[210:24.97]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[210:28.87]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[210:30.75]That... I can't even... I can't even believe that this would happen.
[210:33.19]Like, that's... That is unbelievable that that would be in the game.
[210:36.51]I...
[211:03.55]A wolf came... They attacked with wolves.
[211:07.61]A wolf got into the town.
[211:09.21]And now I lost the entire city.
[211:16.96]What was the last save?
[211:25.14]I'm not doing that.
[211:26.41]That's bogus.
[211:27.69]That's actually fucking bogus.
[211:37.04]That's bogus.
[211:39.93]The true meaning of that word.
[211:45.93]No, I want to spin.
[211:52.78]Get me out of here.
[211:53.84]What a pointless room.
[212:01.88]Where's the save game room?
[212:05.53]Oh, sir, sire, a wolf got into the capital.
[212:09.17]Every single fucking person has turned.
[212:11.20]What time is it?
[212:17.98]Five night?

[213:43.62]That's unbelievable.
[213:49.54]Is there any cheats here?
[213:58.16]That took so much time to get it and it's removed in five seconds.
[214:03.71]This is not even cheats.
[214:05.13]This is like a guide for the game.
[214:13.93]No, do you guys remember when websites used to do this stupid shit?
[214:18.11]And it would be, oh, cheat codes!
[214:20.24]And they would just tell you how to get achievements in the game.
[214:22.68]Or how to unlock something.
[214:26.54]Aren't you so happy that these websites probably get zero fucking traffic now?
[214:37.02]Like, I just went to one of these and I'm probably the first visitor in like four years.
[214:48.71]Dammit.
[214:50.63]I can't fucking believe I have to- at 13- I have to destroy- it's time to destroy.

[216:08.48]Should I reload it?
[216:09.42]How far away was that actually?
[216:10.64]What time is it?

[216:15.11]Let's just reload it.
[216:16.01]I'm going for it.

[242:13.94]Alright, you live here.
[242:16.92]Somebody has to fix this shit up.
[242:20.93]Whatever.
[242:22.55]Alright, this doesn't fill up a little.
[242:25.75]Giving birth, there we go.
[242:26.65]Do they have one of those children places here?
[242:29.27]I don't think they do.
[242:30.37]Alright, wood.
[242:37.83]We need a child care center, whatever it's called.
[242:41.01]They already have, okay.
[242:57.26]Well, I need to build something.
[243:02.91]Does it need wood?
[243:03.59]No, that's right, it's right there.
[243:06.15]I need another one of those construction yards.
[243:10.48]The workshops.
[243:11.24]Alright, I need a civic- what is it called?
[243:19.11]Three to make a civic building.
[243:22.55]Should I make a new village center?
[243:23.83]Or should I make a civic building?
[243:35.58]To launch an attack, you can't.
[243:37.66]It doesn't exist.
[243:43.30]We haven't had the cow in three hours.
[243:45.70]I know the ti- Yeah, I know.
[243:47.26]Well, is that my fault?
[243:51.41]We have this awesome, really cool, fun, awesome mechanic where you have an animal, and they just take the fucking thing away from you three hours, four hours into the game.
[244:06.91]Alright.
[244:07.59]Can I bring this?
[244:08.29]What should I do?
[244:14.10]This is a mega workshop over here.
[244:15.66]No.
[244:17.56]I need it, like, right there.
[244:19.10]What is it?
[244:19.52]Workshop?
[244:23.66]How far can I go out?
[244:28.29]Do they have a workshop?
[244:31.45]They don't, do they?
[244:32.13]Alright, this is it.
[244:39.75]This is a cow waiting room.
[244:40.99]Yeah, I know.
[244:42.07]Me too.
[244:53.98]The reason why I did the workshop here is because I'm going to spam trees into it.
[244:56.29]Disciple builder.
[245:12.38]Name the cow- I already did!
[245:16.74]What's the- what's the name?
[245:28.00]How much more wood?
[245:33.41]Wood- okay.
[245:34.55]Build it.
[245:35.43]You too.
[245:36.61]I don't even know who- did I just grab you?
[245:40.37]Build it!
[245:49.91]Found him.
[245:50.29]No!
[246:01.55]Sacrifice!
[246:02.17]No, I'm not gonna sacrifice.
[246:18.82]We need, uh, I need more builders over here.
[246:21.40]I gotta get, I wanna take this.
[246:22.22]Get done.
[246:23.79]Get it done.
[246:24.27]Hurry up.
[246:24.61]I don't know where the fuck you're going.
[246:33.15]Put down the tree.
[246:38.91]Is he going to ever build the graveyard?
[246:40.83]The idea here is when this is built, I'm going to spam trees into it and build a ton of shit and just command and conquer Red Alert my way over here.
[246:50.44]And then take this over.
[246:58.64]But they have to build it first.
[247:01.96]Get a graveyard already?
[247:03.95]It's part of the plan.
[247:05.67]How are we doing on food?
[247:06.35]We're okay.
[247:06.75]We're okay on wood.
[247:11.38]Almost done.
[247:12.84]Do I need one more builder over here?
[247:14.48]Yes.
[247:22.81]Oh, I gotta ask you a question.
[247:24.61]What game is better?
[247:27.43]London 2012 or Beijing 2008?
[247:33.32]I want to play one of those Olympic track and field games.
[247:37.62]Which one is better?
[247:45.97]The London one is better?
[247:49.21]Seen a lot of London, okay.
[247:55.45]Mario and Sonic?
[247:56.20]Yeah, I'm already going to play Mario and Sonic.
[247:57.74]Alright, let me see how far the influence goes here.
[248:01.54]Alright, can we get a fresh start?
[248:04.20]Can we start to progress instead of having me regress mentally?
[248:12.17]I want my cow, and I'm not stopping the stream until I get him back.
[248:16.32]Not in a million years.
[248:20.50]Said missionaries, I can't go that far.
[248:24.72]If I grab a missionary, I have to like... See, I can't do anything.
[248:38.99]Hurry up and build this damn thing.
[248:43.99]Just throw them and hope they live.
[248:45.89]If I throw somebody that far, they're not going to live.
[249:01.14]And plus I... It's good.
[249:06.60]Just so you don't know.
[249:07.20]Because I've really taken the three of this long to build this.
[249:17.40]Like, what is taking you so long?
[249:25.46]What's this?
[249:26.64]It seems you require help.
[249:29.06]That last village is causing you trouble.
[249:31.70]So I have given your people the ability to build a wonder.
[249:35.72]No, too many resources.
[249:37.04]Too many resources.
[249:38.36]Too many resources.
[249:40.00]I don't have the resources!
[249:43.41]That is all.
[249:44.37]I don't have the resources to do this.
[249:45.77]21,000 fucking resources.
[249:48.31]Thanks for nothing.
[249:52.58]Yeah, thanks for- thanks for pawning off your shitty real estate that won't sell.
[249:56.50]Out of here.
[250:14.55]It's literally surrounded by wood.
[250:15.81]Yeah, but I still have to build it.
[250:17.25]These guys can't even make a workshop.
[250:22.33]And why do I not have any influence?
[250:25.83]I own this building.
[250:32.89]This is outside of my influence.
[250:39.56]What the fuck?
[250:57.36]No.
[250:58.00]No!
[251:00.88]I need a town center.
[251:02.26]Well, let's go!
[251:03.06]I'm doing all this for my boy.
[251:22.80]My baby boy.
[251:24.54]I'm coming to get him.
[251:34.17]Was it three there?
[251:34.89]Okay.
[251:38.45]Town center.
[251:42.57]It's five, right?
[251:44.50]Five for a new village center.
[251:52.49]Click the link.
[251:52.95]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[251:54.19]Not yet.
[252:00.70]Four.
[252:00.98]One more.
[252:06.43]If I don't see a cow this stream, I guarantee you see a cow this stream.
[252:23.26]Okay, there's five here.
[252:28.94]How do I not have to be a field?
[252:30.18]There's five, right?
[252:41.82]Five scaffold.
[253:02.42]I don't fucking care where it is.
[253:04.64]Just build the damn thing.
[253:07.30]He hates the links.
[253:08.06]What's the link?
[253:11.85]Zoinks, you've taken a wrong turn.
[253:13.09]That link doesn't work.
[253:15.61]Punished Mega Milk, a cow denied by his owner.
[253:18.13]Get that out of here!
[253:21.37]I'm trying to save him!
[253:23.64]I've been trying to save him this whole stream!
[253:37.98]Build.
[253:38.30]I'll put 100 people over here.
[253:39.56]I don't care.
[253:44.16]Get to work.
[254:02.92]Punished.
[254:03.46]How much more?
[254:06.35]One more.
[254:09.22]Okay, now get some more builders over here and I'm almost done.
[254:20.83]Build.
[254:23.21]More.
[254:25.03]More.
[254:42.79]Frank that's a whole lot of sugar and water more Go Going to sleep on the floor
[255:15.70]Build me a new town center.
[255:20.66]Hurry.
[255:22.20]So I can go over here.
[255:25.39]Might as well start dumping wood in this thing.
[255:36.26]Punish them?
[255:37.78]They're okay.
[255:44.24]I'll put, like, another couple of hou- no, we need, uh, farms and shit out here.
[255:47.54]Honestly, I wish Jerma would just say he doesn't like the cow.
[255:58.15]We haven't seen him all stream because Jerma's trying to save him, but in reality, he doesn't want him.
[256:08.77]Fuck.
[256:10.05]God damn it.
[256:11.39]Aww.
[256:13.23]How could you say something like that?
[256:14.85]I love him.
[256:17.54]I love... Murius.
[256:24.32]How could you say something so incorrect?
[256:33.80]Just wait till we get him.
[256:34.78]And it's going to be so much better.
[256:36.64]Okay.
[256:46.90]You just had to remember his name.
[256:48.60]Yeah, that's true.
[256:49.34]You're right.
[256:50.12]Yeah, I did.
[256:50.68]I just forgot his name again.
[256:53.82]Like, weirdly enough, I'm forgetting his name because... Hold on, let me do the heal.
[257:02.62]Because I keep trying not to say the one that you've implanted in my brain.
[257:11.54]He's not going to be the same.
[257:13.16]Yes, he will.
[257:15.63]Looking at something?
[257:17.62]I've finished building this.
[257:26.55]Finished building that.
[257:28.49]You're driving me crazy.
[257:29.71]Oh, they're going over there.
[257:33.95]Why?
[257:34.03]Alright.
[257:36.13]Let's get ourselves another field.
[257:41.05]It's going right... Where's it going?
[257:42.57]Right in this town?
[257:43.47]No, up here.
[257:50.81]No, where should that go?
[257:52.33]Do they even have any way to produce food in this town?
[257:55.45]No, this is no food production.
[257:56.65]Only right there.
[257:57.15]Alright, what are we going to do over here?
[257:59.85]Like, literally.
[258:00.45]Like, literally.
[258:01.39]Literally right there.
[258:06.95]Still not done.
[258:09.98]Slowest workers ever.
[258:16.76]Just wait for the redemption arc.
[258:21.08]Right now we're on a yogi arc.
[258:26.42]Just wait.
[258:28.15]Wait until we get the redemption arc from Murius.
[258:40.03]Put a wood in the wonder.
[258:43.53]It's too far away for me to reliably do it.
[258:47.84]Yeah.
[258:51.00]It's too far away for me to do it reliably.
[258:52.62]Alright, it's almost done.
[259:01.35]Hurry up!
[259:02.17]Please!
[259:02.83]I need to get over here!
[259:18.97]This is ridiculous.
[259:24.43]It's 84% complete with a dozen people working on it.
[259:28.71]Peter Molyneux, you're not old enough to work.
[259:35.12]Here comes the filler episode.
[259:39.80]Just wait till we get to the actual arc.
[259:43.42]Why is there a seven-year-old up here?
[259:49.47]Is that the cow making that noise?
[259:51.05]What are you doing here?
[260:02.41]Finish it.
[260:07.10]Finished!
[260:09.02]Alright.
[260:10.08]Is it... This is the only area I get?
[260:15.73]Oh my god.
[260:41.55]I can't fucking believe it.
[260:47.67]This person's dead.
[260:49.53]This person worked to death, apparently.
[261:00.60]Worked until they died.
[261:05.98]Well, I know where I'm going to put the graveyard.
[261:07.50]I'll put it right over here.
[261:17.15]Just build a line of houses here.
[261:19.91]If I build a house right here, will this expand?
[261:34.98]Somebody... They'll just build it.
[261:38.78]Don't work on this right now.
[261:40.18]I can't even pick you up.
[261:52.25]Work on this.
[261:52.77]I just wanted you to work over here.
[262:10.10]Like, I'm coming.
[262:12.16]Disciple builder.
[262:23.16]Now we need to breed We're okay with food, right?
[262:28.04]Alright breeding time Anybody who in this town can breed you two I think No, I gotta start moving people from the other town
[262:53.45]I'm so sick of that fucking happening.
[262:55.99]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[262:57.07]Like... What do you think I'm trying to do?
[262:58.25]Stand next to me!
[262:58.99]He's just pointing and laughing.
[263:26.36]Oh my god.
[263:32.31]Okay.
[263:33.17]We have some breeding going on now.
[263:34.85]We're gonna populate this with that town.
[263:38.85]And hopefully they'll finish this.
[263:42.99]Why are they cutting the tree down?
[263:44.25]Because they needed wood?
[263:54.87]When are you going to get to the Half-Life factory?
[263:56.65]I don't even know what that means.
[264:00.27]I don't even know what that means.
[264:01.55]Is that supposed to mean something?
[264:05.64]I don't know if that's supposed to mean something.
[264:07.84]Alright, build that.
[264:20.83]How much wood do I need?
[264:27.54]Okay, there are like four or five breeders over there now.
[264:31.79]Now finish this hut.
[264:39.89]No, stop going.
[264:40.95]I'll take care of this.
[264:43.06]You don't even need any more wood.
[264:49.00]Why are they doing this?
[264:54.63]Wood required zero.
[264:59.67]What are you guys doing?
[265:09.35]Like sledding.
[265:18.10]Guys, you don't have to go to the forest for wood.
[265:23.00]What are you doing?
[265:25.78]No!
[265:33.60]Where are you going?
[265:47.05]Somebody finish this.
[265:49.87]They're chasing after the tree.
[265:54.71]They don't know what to do.
[265:55.95]They can't go into the building site with the wood.
[266:01.76]And what, may I ask, are you doing that for?
[266:14.26]Okay.
[266:17.22]I guess you made two different piles.
[266:22.50]I heard somebody say Omegalola in real life and ironically today.
[266:25.51]I've heard that once.
[266:27.89]I've heard it.
[266:37.68]Finish it so I can please have some more influence.
[266:39.56]Before I actually shit my pants.
[266:43.10]Alright, how's the breeding going okay?
[266:53.43]Breeder, breeder.
[266:54.21]Okay, I have a new child.
[266:56.85]Okay, let's check the other town.
[266:58.08]We haven't seen in a while.
[266:59.42]That's 85.
[267:02.72]Dancing, dancing, dancing.
[267:04.94]Okay.
[267:07.28]Let's do some breeding.
[267:15.24]I'm going to bring you over here.
[267:16.26]I'm going to bring some more of the young people this way.
[267:22.39]Let's do some breeding over here.
[267:26.43]You live here now?
[267:31.25]Live here and love.
[267:33.01]Live here and love.
[267:35.79]Live here and love.
[267:37.23]Specifically... These people are all like a 10.
[267:39.87]Wait, what?
[267:40.43]This wasn't a...
[267:51.71]Alright, I need a female.
[267:52.69]27.
[267:57.83]Is that a female?
[268:03.87]No.
[268:05.79]49.
[268:05.81]Alright, let's go.
[268:09.48]I'm working on it.
[268:14.82]Live here.
[268:16.06]Live here in love.
[268:17.82]And... Breed.
[268:23.01]There you go, okay.
[268:25.17]Keep it going.
[268:25.65]How are we doing?
[268:27.99]Is this done?
[268:29.65]I mean, there's really not that much more influence.
[268:36.67]There's like barely any at all.
[268:48.25]Save these edits for later For when I get the cow and then probably like turn the stream off because it's been like eight hours Doing this dumb shit Alright, I gotta start to pull the far I gotta we're gonna start to build this shit
[269:20.02]Hopefully this actually does what I think it's going to do.
[269:27.96]How many more do I need?
[269:28.68]10,000.
[269:28.70]Does anybody have 10,000 wood over here?
[269:32.30]I'm not even sure there's 10,000 wood in this entire forest.
[269:48.17]I missed the cow.
[269:51.97]Yeah, because without the cow, this game just turns into like a grindy building sim.
[269:58.81]The cow was fun and funny and shit, and they took him from us.
[270:20.44]They took him from you.
[270:23.49]yeah but it's it's us we're in this together can I not grab from this forest nothing to do except for build this house not under attack build
[270:57.56]Looking for something to do?
[270:59.13]What the fuck are you talking about?
[271:01.59]Do I have to drop the actor here?
[271:35.14]Someone will eventually build this thing.
[271:37.16]I hope.
[271:37.46]How much more wood?
[271:42.40]A thousand.
[271:52.97]I'm starting to shimmy around in my chair.
[271:54.43]Alright.
[271:55.61]For the love of God, build this so I can finish this stupid level.
[272:05.47]Is this what that person was talking about when they said, oh, you got to level three.
[272:08.68]Laugh out loud.
[272:10.70]Is this why you were laughing?
[272:12.18]Is this why you thought this was so funny?
[272:26.67]He warned you.
[272:34.03]Just build this.
[272:35.93]Just build it.
[272:37.57]Does everybody fucking get over here and build this shit?
[272:41.09]I want my cow.
[272:55.96]Your ignorance has led to your defeat?
[273:00.83]I don't think so.
[273:04.01]What do you mean, defeat?
[273:06.67]I'm not defeated yet.
[273:10.33]Peter Molyneux.
[273:14.53]Go build this.
[273:15.81]No, you don't have to go get food.
[273:20.42]I'll take care of that.
[273:21.12]Just stay there.
[273:28.52]I'm just gonna dump it right next to you guys.
[273:30.14]Here.
[273:32.77]No, I can't your influence you can't move Finish it 41 get over here Build it build it They're getting wood
[274:12.02]Stomp them.
[274:14.78]I just have to get up here and then we release our friend who we want so desperately and so badly.
[274:22.92]And then when I get out of here, I'm going to fucking murder.
[274:27.00]I'm going to murder this motherfucker right here.
[274:37.42]Now I'm going to kill that guy so badly.
[274:43.10]We're so close.
[274:45.86]Just build this wonder.
[274:47.60]What's the percentage?
[274:48.28]Is it done?
[274:51.96]27% complete.
[274:52.88]Oh, that's a huge... Alright, in the meantime, let's work on... Oh my god.
[275:01.37]Okay.
[275:03.31]In the meantime, we have to work on family building here.
[275:16.56]That's a two-year-old.
[275:20.30]I wish I could group grab people instead of having to drag all the way across and grab somebody and bring them all the way back.
[275:29.01]Disciple Forester.
[275:35.72]And I also wish it wasn't the same button.
[275:37.98]See what I'm saying?
[275:39.80]Like, I don't want you to... I want you to be... I don't... Why does it have to be the same button?
[275:44.96]I want you to breed.
[275:46.44]And nothing else.
[275:47.78]And I have to wait until the indicator goes correct.
[275:50.14]Because it's a tree next to me.
[275:57.75]I just had it!
[275:58.39]Oh man, I'm starting to get annoyed.
[276:08.48]Cracks in the armor are showing in Black and White 1.
[276:14.02]It was the cow that was keeping it all together.
[276:29.10]Stay strong for the cow.
[276:31.90]Oh, I'm gonna... Don't you worry.
[276:51.71]I can goddamnit build this already so I can stop this madness and have fun!
[276:57.18]How could you possibly have nothing to do?
[277:20.35]We're not supposed to be doing that right now.
[277:23.91]What percentage is this at?
[277:30.82]51?
[277:30.86]It's almost there.
[277:31.68]And then hopefully we get a big circle here, and then I can finally just take this over and be done with this.
[277:41.68]We need offspring!
[277:43.88]There are no women in this whole fucking village.
[277:47.42]When I started the game, it was 80% men.
[277:51.76]There are no females.
[278:04.21]Disciple breeder.
[278:09.77]Offspring.
[278:33.72]Whose baby is it gonna be?
[278:35.44]Whose baby is it gonna be?
[278:37.50]I don't know.
[278:38.24]We're not gonna know.
[278:39.45]Do the tree puzzle.
[278:45.53]When's my wonder gonna be done?
[278:52.07]To do, like, a paternity test.
[278:57.02]Wow.
[278:57.82]Ooh.
[278:59.74]Whoa.
[279:00.68]We need women.
[279:04.06]We need women, is what we need.
[279:05.83]Is this person carrying a rock?
[279:09.57]What are you carrying?
[279:16.79]We need offspring.
[279:18.15]We need more than three women in the entire group.
[279:33.19]Is that a wolf?
[279:40.18]I can't grab them because it's stupid.
[279:42.04]This is stupid border thing.
[279:44.58]Which one of them is the one?
[279:54.12]The wolves don't care at least people are breeding over here What's presented?
[280:10.55]Nothing to do.
[280:12.41]Any women?
[280:16.96]Yeah?
[280:18.90]Disciple breeder.
[280:22.30]Disciple breeder.
[280:23.38]Now you have something to do.
[280:24.18]Excuse me.
[280:27.44]Come on out.
[280:29.70]Any women?
[280:32.76]No.
[280:32.98]Go back to bed.
[280:39.06]Any women?
[280:42.48]All... Alright, who's in here?
[280:51.03]There are breeders over here now, right?
[280:52.59]Alright, let's go back this way.
[280:55.69]Here we go, okay.
[280:58.05]Now we're making some babies.
[280:59.39]I think this is the only woman in the whole town.
[281:08.12]These are all her children.
[281:25.43]Look at all these kids now.
[281:27.31]Alright, we have lots of kids.
[281:31.15]I think we can stop with this now.
[281:33.94]Go back to... Go back to foresting.
[281:36.40]Excuse me, get out.
[281:41.28]Get out.
[281:42.78]Get out of the house.
[281:47.13]Oh, were you guys... Oh, were you busy in there?
[281:53.41]Wait, I need you.
[281:56.52]Do what you're doing, but do it over here.
[282:04.76]Okay.
[282:05.28]It comes with a 78-year-old female...
[282:25.81]Disciple breeder.
[282:33.93]She's already giving birth?
[282:36.01]Disciple breeder.
[282:38.94]Well, there we go.
[282:39.32]Alright.
[282:42.54]Did you build it yet?
[282:48.36]Who's dead?
[282:48.76]Somebody's dead?
[282:49.62]Who's dead?
[282:54.10]89%.
[282:54.70]Will you fucking just fix it already?
[282:56.34]I need food.
[283:07.75]How's a baby formed?
[283:13.29]Two people that love each other.
[283:14.49]I don't know.
[283:21.06]Ask your parents.
[283:32.58]But you're my dad.
[283:33.50]I am not your dad.
[283:35.62]93%.
[283:38.23]Peter Barlanew, hurry up and finish it.
[283:45.68]Peter Molyneux, hurry up and make another game where you make this big group social experiment with somebody that gets to the center of a giant cube that potentially cost hundreds of dollars to spam mine the cube.
[284:02.00]When they get to the center of that cube, you make them the creative director for your new game, but it's not real, and that game barely even comes out.
[284:14.61]If you were the last person to click inside of the cube in that Peter Molyneux cube game, you got to be the creative director of Goddess, right?
[284:25.40]And didn't the person that won not even get to do that?
[284:29.16]Didn't they bring him into a room and they were like, ah, well, you're really not going to do that, but, uh, what do you think?
[284:34.36]Do you think that this would be fun?
[284:35.89]And the dude's like, I guess.
[284:39.55]Okay, thanks for coming.
[284:47.40]You did it.
[284:48.50]You made it to the center of the cube.
[284:50.30]Wait, we're done.
[284:51.58]We got it.
[284:53.64]Is it done?
[285:10.33]It's not done, is it?
[285:13.40]I didn't get anything.
[285:14.62]Sorry, I got lied to.
[285:16.22]By the yogi guy.
[285:21.88]This doesn't do anything.
[285:26.49]At this point, I think I'm gonna start throwing fucking rocks from over here.
[286:01.56]I'm just building single houses.
[286:02.99]In a straight line this way.
[286:25.93]Houses don't give influence.
[286:27.07]Only town center and scaffoldings do.
[286:31.65]Well, how the fuck am I supposed to get over here?
[286:37.61]Build another town center over here?
[286:39.49]Do I have to use the throw guy?
[286:48.41]I have to increase my population massively.
[286:55.34]I mean, they're going at it.
[286:56.92]They're going for it.
[287:00.74]Offspring!
[287:07.74]It's all men.
[287:10.60]It's all fucking men.
[287:13.72]Guys, we only have men.
[287:18.30]There's only males.
[287:20.87]Why?
[287:38.89]Let's go find out once and fucking for all.
[287:41.33]I want to see just how stupid this is.
[287:49.84]Alright.
[287:51.60]60% male.
[287:52.52]But that could be in the other villages.
[287:53.84]No, I don't want to go in the creature cave.
[288:00.18]I want...
[288:12.51]He's angry clicking now.
[288:13.63]I just want him.
[288:16.21]I just want my fucking creature back, because that was fun.
[288:20.42]There are so many people over here.
[288:21.86]So many kids.
[288:23.74]We have to start bringing... I mean, I have so many people, though.
[288:26.58]Like, I have a lot of people.
[288:29.44]I make up a majority of all the population in this whole world.
[288:35.47]Look at all these kids.
[288:48.87]Do I really have to get the throw guy and like bring a missionary or something over there?
[288:55.33]What's the premise of this game in five words?
[288:56.81]Uh, game sucks without the cow.
[289:02.42]There.
[289:12.86]Where's the guy that I can throw?
[289:16.96]This guy's 94 years old.
[289:18.53]94 years old!
[289:19.11]I hope you don't die, because I need you.
[289:21.21]Alright, how much influence do I need here?
[289:22.63]What is it at?
[289:47.15]How much do I need?
[289:49.81]500?
[289:49.83]That's not too bad.
[289:50.83]Just destroy the whole fucking town.
[289:53.49]And then I finally get my cow.
[289:58.08]Where is he?
[290:00.60]I'm gonna try not to throw you.
[290:02.90]Alright, this is actually where I have to raise the banner here.
[290:09.26]I need lightning.
[290:10.74]I'm just destroying the whole thing.
[290:17.49]Where's the lightning?
[290:19.11]Here it is.
[290:19.43]Alright, let's get lightning.
[290:21.73]Let's do like 60%.
[290:23.51]I'm gonna put food over there.
[290:24.57]And hopefully we can release that cow.
[290:39.20]I know.
[290:40.58]But it don't matter because half of them are going over there anyways to worship.
[290:46.31]They're going to this one, right?
[290:49.07]Yes.
[290:50.45]Is it this one?
[290:50.89]I think it's that one.
[290:55.42]Wait, which one is it?
[290:56.04]Is it the one on the right or the one on the left?
[291:02.26]Yeah, it's the one on the left.
[291:06.91]Okay, give me the lightning.
[291:08.25]Eventually.
[291:11.63]Alright, there's food over there.
[291:14.21]Okay, where's that actor?
[291:15.17]Let's torch the place.
[291:16.87]Was he dead?
[291:27.92]Where is he?
[291:50.04]Where the hell did he go?
[291:52.22]No, that's not the same guy.
[291:53.32]That's the yogi guy.
[291:56.36]Wasn't he, like, right here?
[291:57.12]Yeah, he was right here.
[292:04.25]Is he fucking dead?
[292:10.09]There he is.
[292:16.52]Alright.
[292:18.59]So begins the process again.
[292:20.47]Where we use this hundred year old man to be able to... We have to listen to this shit again.
[292:30.48]Oh my eye.
[292:48.37]Use him for his intended purpose?
[292:49.67]What the hell is his intended purpose?
[292:53.29]He has an actual purpose?
[292:55.51]What on Earth is it?
[293:02.55]Oh, you big... Please don't throw me.
[293:07.45]Oh, you big bully.
[293:09.03]Please don't throw me.
[293:12.03]Oh, you big bully.
[293:13.79]Try it again and you're dead.
[293:16.21]Lightning.
[293:25.49]Fire!
[293:32.12]Fire!
[293:32.98]I'm on fire!
[293:34.84]Put him out!
[293:35.90]Put him out!
[293:36.42]Put him out!
[293:36.70]Put him out!
[293:36.96]Put him out!
[293:37.22]I need to put him out.
[293:39.54]Put him out!
[293:39.87]Put him out!
[293:40.13]Put him out!
[293:40.39]Put him out!
[293:40.83]Put him out!
[293:41.11]Is he dead?
[293:41.81]Can he die?
[293:42.31]He can't die though, right?
[293:45.95]Ah, relief.
[293:49.48]Oh shit.
[293:50.76]Okay, he's good.
[293:56.70]What did that do?
[293:58.17]How much more belief do I need?
[294:10.39]Torture him.
[294:11.93]No, I need to try to, like, at least get this down.
[294:15.95]You didn't kill me.
[294:17.29]Get off.
[294:17.97]Get off.
[294:18.45]You didn't kill me.
[294:19.49]Get off.
[294:20.15]Get off me.
[294:21.25]Burn down the enemy's building?
[294:22.39]Oh, you big bully.
[294:24.63]Please don't throw me.
[294:25.89]I mean, that's kind of slowly but surely what I'm trying to do.
[294:28.15]Get off me.
[294:29.15]You didn't kill me.
[294:30.03]Please don't throw me.
[294:31.53]Okay, here we go.
[294:34.62]Let's see.
[294:35.02]What about... How much does it save me?
[294:36.64]Let me see.
[294:38.86]You didn't... Please don't throw me.
[294:40.98]You didn't kill me.
[294:45.36]How much do I need?
[294:47.14]400?
[294:47.20]I just get... Okay, that should be easy.
[294:50.94]Please don't throw me.
[294:52.57]Oh, you big... Please don't throw me.
[294:58.05]Okay.
[295:00.39]Let's try this again.
[295:05.35]Tortured again.
[295:05.99]You didn't kill me.
[295:15.94]Indian power.
[295:18.34]Indian power.
[295:28.23]We rained hell down on them.
[295:29.81]Oh, you big bully.
[295:31.31]Try it again.
[295:31.95]Indian power.
[295:33.15]Indian power.
[295:40.15]Indian power.
[295:43.41]It's necessary!
[295:44.97]Okay, I don't want to do this anymore!
[295:49.36]He's going berserk.
[295:50.80]No, I'm not going berserk!
[296:16.94]My hand?
[296:17.36]What's winning me my hand?
[296:24.16]How many more beliefs do I need?
[296:25.84]270?
[296:25.94]Where's the actor?
[296:27.17]Where's the actor?
[296:28.05]There he is.
[296:30.03]Oh, you big bully.
[296:30.51]Try water.
[296:30.83]You didn't kill me.
[296:49.56]Water.
[296:51.40]I can't do water.
[296:52.18]It's the wrong... Water!
[296:56.14]Oh, you big bully.
[296:57.93]Try it again and you're dead.
[297:00.03]Look at his hand.
[297:03.79]I don't want to do this anymore.
[297:07.75]The blood moon is rising.
[297:10.40]The wrong people are worshipping.
[297:11.90]Oh, you big bully.
[297:13.06]Try it again and you're dead.
[297:16.75]This is all for the cow, guys.
[297:17.88]It's all to get the cow, and then we can... Finally, the world is evil.
[297:23.74]Blood moon rising.
[297:25.16]Oh.
[297:28.50]Oh, god.
[297:30.48]Okay, I have to calm down.
[297:31.54]Oh, shit.
[297:48.02]Where's the actor?
[297:53.13]He's currently on fire somewhere, right?
[297:54.61]There he is.
[297:56.19]Did I heal?
[298:16.35]75 belief.
[298:17.51]Holy fuck, that's a lot.
[298:19.69]Only 182.
[298:19.93]Let's heal again.
[298:22.83]Heal.
[298:23.37]Come on, hurry up.
[298:23.97]It's like 60% of my entire population is praying right now.
[298:28.72]What is going on here?
[298:49.35]Water!

[303:21.99]No porn links.
[303:22.41]61 belief needed.
[303:28.32]Get off!
[303:28.96]Get off me!
[303:29.90]Oh, you big bully.
[303:31.54]Try it again.

[303:50.37]Give me my fucking cow now.
[303:53.28]Give me my cow.
[303:53.90]That was five hours to do this.
[303:56.36]Give me my cow now!
[303:58.34]We've taken over the village.
[304:04.16]Oh, did somebody get loose?
[304:06.10]Quickly, my creature.
[304:08.16]Take this lost village back for me.
[304:10.22]I'm sorry.
[304:10.78]Our creature's free, but he's really hurt.

[318:02.63]He tried so hard.
[318:03.07]He almost had it too.
[318:03.67]Oh.
[318:26.77]It was saved during the fight.
[318:29.37]Let's go.
[318:30.11]Wait, don't, no, hold on.
[318:34.56]Oh, he had no health too.
[318:36.10]He had zero fucking HP.
[318:39.16]Oh, oh, that was so, that was so awesome.
[318:43.50]And it just, he didn't finish the job.
[318:45.84]He had it.
[318:48.90]Oh, too bad.
[318:50.60]Too bad.
[318:51.12]That was a really good attempt.
[318:52.46]Wait, did it actually save right in the middle?
[318:55.96]You could have ordered him to heal.
[318:57.10]Yeah, I was trying to do that.
[318:59.54]Like, do I have to like cast and then do it?
[319:04.78]Damn it.
[319:05.06]708?
[319:06.70]That's not correct.
[319:07.46]731.
[319:07.48]I think that's correct.
[319:23.83]Let's go Why does he have no health?
[319:48.73]I got anti-save scum

[322:07.53]Indian power.
[322:11.33]Indian power.
[322:15.83]Where you going?
[322:20.57]Heal your creature and then load the save where you were in the middle of the fight.
[322:23.53]You'll be at 100% health.

[326:07.44]Alright, we'll do this one.
[326:10.56]Alright, ready?
[326:14.23]Let's see if it works.
[326:16.27]So it is this one right here.
[326:19.31]7.31 PM, let's go.
[326:21.60]Give it a try.
[326:22.40]Full health, did it work?
[326:48.32]Cast a Heal Miracle?
[326:49.10]I don't have enough time to cast a Miracle right there.
[326:51.84]He just dies in one hit.
[326:54.41]Heal before he hits you?
[326:56.17]That's going to be so hard to do that.
[327:00.17]No, I'm going to do the one afterwards.
[327:09.62]I'm going to do the one that I should have done.
[327:12.36]The one from 7... Wait, is that the latest one?
[327:18.83]720.
[327:19.21]Wait, what?
[327:24.38]939.
[327:25.50]That's not correct.
[327:31.44]No, whatever.
[327:34.27]Heal before reloading.
[327:35.27]That's what I just did.
[327:35.89]That is actually what just happened.
[327:51.70]You fed him.
[327:52.30]You didn't heal him.
[327:54.76]What?
[327:58.01]How much... What is his health?
[328:00.59]No, his damage wasn't at 83%.
[328:01.81]It was at 0%.
[328:03.25]No, you guys... He was at 0%.
[328:08.99]Alright, I'm taking out the village.
[328:12.59]He healed himself.
[328:20.53]I'm winning.
[328:31.50]What's the best way for me to do this?
[328:33.46]Probably just to go like this.
[328:35.12]Honestly.
[328:38.16]Like, I just took this person?
[328:39.26]I was gonna one by one wipe out the entire village.
[329:14.69]This is not going to work.
[329:19.15]Sacrifice their people?
[329:21.09]It's just they don't have enough time to get in here and do anything.
[329:25.83]Did I get somebody?
[329:29.11]No, I got that food.
[329:32.59]Lightning.

[336:46.48]Where's his creature?
[336:48.52]Roaming around back here somewhere?
[336:58.56]Go find him?
[337:01.70]He was coming to me.
[337:03.36]There he is.
[337:05.00]Alright, you fucking dick.
[337:08.56]Once and for all.
[337:12.01]Once and for all.
[337:35.70]What's he doing?
[337:43.73]What is he doing?
[337:46.73]He wants to do it!
[337:47.61]Switch the leg!
[338:20.60]Holy shit!
[338:25.70]He just sees... Play defense!
[338:27.48]Play defense!
[338:32.02]Let him burn!
[338:39.86]Ooh!
[338:40.19]Do it again!
[338:41.51]It's alright.
[338:46.35]Use your strengths, what I taught you.
[339:06.50]That was unbelievable.
[339:10.23]Very good job.
[339:14.95]Now go spawn camp him.
[339:23.42]Lightning.
[339:37.35]He's so good.
[339:38.45]You just have to do this.
[339:39.29]Look, he's running away.
[339:44.45]He's like, no, no, I don't want anymore to do with you.
[339:51.89]You're too strong.
[339:52.61]You have insane lightning moves.
[339:56.00]Slay him.
[339:57.38]Your creature is on a killing spree.
[340:00.02]Kill!
[340:00.44]Kill him!
[340:29.68]Look at that anger.
[340:31.06]Remember this?
[340:32.78]Remember when you did this shit to me?
[340:35.82]I remember.
[340:39.88]I remember.
[340:41.15]Yes, I do.
[340:46.71]Revenge.
[340:55.55]Don't let him out.
[341:02.27]More fire.
[341:04.90]I'm trying to help.
[341:10.52]Take this down.
[341:12.36]You know you can do it.
[341:13.16]Here.
[341:15.50]Burn the building down.
[341:22.82]There it is.
[341:23.95]More.
[341:25.11]Do it again.
[341:25.75]Burn it.
[341:27.43]This is for you.
[341:28.11]This is you, Murius.
[341:31.94]This is your fight.
[341:32.88]This is your revenge.
[341:33.70]I'm gonna let you have it completely.
[341:43.79]Oh, you- what, are you back for more?
[341:45.49]He can't even cast a fucking spell.
[341:49.55]He can't even cast a fucking- wait, he shrunk me.
[341:54.48]What?
[341:56.88]He's shrinking me!
[342:00.64]He wants revenge.
[342:06.25]He's like, no, this is my final stand.
[342:13.73]That was the plan all along.
[342:16.91]Don't let him beat you.
[342:20.61]He didn't care.
[342:22.05]Go for the castle.
[342:25.93]He's getting tired.
[342:51.14]Let's go.
[342:52.94]Here we go again.
[342:53.66]Don't let him get you back.
[343:05.54]Don't let him get you back.
[343:06.28]Oh, fuck.
[343:08.83]He's getting close.
[343:13.65]Was he out of mana?
[343:26.38]He's out of mana.
[343:28.48]He's too tired.
[343:33.28]Your people are dying through over-worship.
[343:36.28]Stop this at once.
[343:37.98]He's tired.
[343:39.08]He's too tired.
[343:40.35]He cast... He cast, like, turn lightning bolts and five fireballs at the fucking temple guy.
[343:48.13]Oh no, now he's coming for revenge.
[344:03.10]What's he doing?
[344:04.22]Where's he going?
[344:05.08]He's coming- Where is he going?
[344:12.13]Wait, hold on a minute.
[344:13.19]Is he coming- Where is he going?
[344:15.87]Is he coming all the way down to spawn camp me?
[344:24.10]I kinda need to know.
[344:31.54]Guys, don't ever grief each other in the lobby because this is just what happens.
[344:35.11]It never stops.
[344:42.47]This will go on perpetually forever until somebody leaves the server.
[344:52.82]Wait, he's already up.
[344:54.36]He's already up.
[344:55.86]The people are suffering.
[344:57.25]He's already up.
[345:03.67]He's not actually... Oh, fuck!
[345:06.17]I didn't mean to do that.
[345:12.62]He needs to eat something.
[345:24.03]Now eat him!
[345:28.01]Wait.
[345:29.43]Oh, he's torching the village.
[345:30.99]You motherfucker.
[345:33.05]What happened?
[345:39.09]Why did he get up?
[345:42.57]Why did he get up?
[345:44.50]He's over here causing mayhem.
[345:47.12]Oh, he's coming.
[345:48.38]He's coming.
[345:49.84]He's coming.
[345:54.78]Stop getting up.
[345:58.82]Eat food.
[345:59.64]Miracle food.
[346:01.64]Here, eat this.
[346:05.60]Yes, eat it.
[346:09.82]Eat.
[346:13.41]Yes, eat it.
[346:14.21]Eat that food.
[346:14.93]Eat it.
[346:18.61]He's burning down my village.
[346:22.15]I'm gonna fucking lose my mind, guys.
[346:31.41]Okay.
[346:32.75]Go get him.
[346:40.55]Where is he?
[346:46.63]Go in the vortex?
[346:48.97]I'll go in the vortex after one more fight.
[346:51.53]If he's not on the way, I'll go in the vortex if he's not on the way.
[346:55.82]Just use the vortex, fuck it.
[346:57.16]He's right here though, look at him.
[346:59.64]Fuckface.
[347:00.14]Oh, are you scared?
[347:25.74]Is he coming?
[347:29.94]Wait.
[347:31.72]You missed it.
[347:32.30]You tried to cast a fireball at him.
[347:33.82]What are you doing?
[347:42.25]If this doesn't get out of any mana, get in there.
[347:47.43]No more taunting.
[347:48.03]Get in there.
[347:48.81]This is it.
[347:50.59]This is the final battle with the fucking lightning going in the background.
[347:57.71]New song.
[347:59.01]Uh, this one.
[348:13.84]Good.
[348:14.18]Nice job.
[348:16.70]You got meter advantage?
[348:17.64]Good.
[348:22.28]Lightning.
[348:23.40]Lightning storm him.
[348:24.94]Lightning storm him.
[348:26.52]Bingo.
[348:28.97]Get in there.
[348:29.63]Right ahead.
[348:30.55]What, did he give up?
[348:32.29]What's going on?
[349:01.05]Did he give up?
[349:04.27]What happened?
[349:07.92]He's like, I don't want to do this though.
[349:12.58]Look at this guy right here.
[349:21.63]What is it?
[349:22.87]Are they friends?
[349:31.53]I don't understand.
[349:40.19]Are they friendly?
[349:41.06]I wanted to see if they were going to be friends.
[349:54.73]Wrongly.
[349:55.37]I know, but that's fine.
[349:58.05]Where are they going?
[350:03.39]And why is he so much faster than me?
[350:13.79]They stopped fighting.
[350:14.67]And then I changed the leash well after that.
[350:20.36]I have no idea where the fuck he's going.
[350:22.64]I'm just going to go in the portal.
[350:23.60]Let's go in the portal and end this.
[350:37.52]Finish off the god.
[350:38.48]Well, that's what I was trying to do last time, but he fucking ran out of energy.
[350:51.89]There is no last village.
[350:52.87]Alright, I'm going to give this one second here to see what happens.
[351:04.26]And I'm going through the portal.
[351:26.60]Oh my god, you're getting fucking flexed on.
[351:29.66]Alright, now fight!
[351:31.64]Thank you.
[352:03.90]What is he doing?
[352:06.16]What is he saying?
[352:07.28]He's like just ignoring him.
[352:13.04]Take off the leash.
[352:13.94]Take off the leash.
[352:18.07]Take off the leash.
[352:25.09]Alright, I'm fucking out of here.
[352:26.53]I'm out of here.
[352:29.54]Go in the portal, quick!
[352:31.44]Go in the portal.
[352:32.22]I'm just going in.
[352:33.70]Get in the portal.
[352:34.42]I don't care.
[352:40.56]How do you come back from the break dance-off?
[353:10.14]Actually, no supplies?
[353:11.26]It's alright.
[353:12.12]I don't know if I'm gonna continue.
[353:16.00]Wow, here we are.
[353:18.14]You know, you did the right thing by sparing Lethys, leader.
[353:25.33]Just look at the state of the place.
[353:28.27]It's been utterly blasted.
[353:30.49]How cool is that?
[353:34.27]Oh, it's awful.
[353:35.61]It used to be green and pleasant.
[353:39.29]What?
[353:39.51]We've never been here before.
[353:40.35]That was fucking ridiculous.
[353:45.73]We have, actually.
[353:47.05]You remember these?
[353:48.82]Oh, that's the tutorial.
[353:49.84]Wow.
[353:53.38]And I recall some of these buildings.
[353:57.80]And even our temple.
[353:59.26]It's all rather damaged, though.
[354:01.22]You're right.
[354:02.24]Still, the atmosphere is much better now.
[354:11.61]Wait, what?
[354:14.67]What the hell is going on?
[354:15.95]What am I supposed to do about it?
[354:19.89]What's going on?
[354:28.94]Uh... What do we do?
[354:37.25]There he is.
[354:37.77]Murius.
[354:38.01]Here, have a cow.
[354:38.49]Alright, I think I'm done.
[354:39.43]I think I'm done.
[354:40.01]I think I'm done.
[354:41.07]I don't know if I can handle this anymore.
[355:14.09]You're gonna abandon him?
[355:15.19]I'm not gonna abandon him.
[355:18.39]This dancing thing.
[355:19.55]Okay, we need... Find the big... Where's the sheep?
[355:26.21]Yeah.
[355:26.89]Oh, the sheep's probably gone.
[355:29.18]What?
[355:29.64]Oh.
[355:37.64]Okay, you're gonna have to speak up.
[355:42.97]I'm from a village nearby.
[355:48.05]Well, I play black and white, too.
[355:49.29]Yeah, probably.
[355:51.23]I ask that you remove the curse on our land.
[355:58.06]A god visited us long ago.
[356:00.38]He showed us his power and his might.
[356:02.86]It was a terrifying display.
[356:07.18]Yeah, actually, before I... Let me check out the skirmishes.
[356:09.99]You see, this land used to be beautiful.
[356:12.54]We lived in peace here, and we didn't want for anything.
[356:15.94]Then the gods themselves appeared with the concepts of good and evil.
[356:20.06]At first, always will.
[356:22.04]But then the one called Nemesis arrived and punished us for following you.
[356:33.00]That dance-off was seriously ridiculous.
[356:34.99]That was some Looney Tunes shit.
[356:36.95]We were forced to worship him.
[356:38.69]He brought forth fire from the heavens.
[356:44.20]He gave us pillars of lightning.
[356:46.26]Our lives have become a living hell.
[356:52.30]Even the sky turned the color of blood.
[356:59.00]But Nemesis got bored with us and left us alone.
[357:02.12]He wanted to continue his quest to be the only god.
[357:05.68]So he set three Guardian Stones to con- The first lies under a spiritual shield.
[357:13.10]Even the wisest of our people don't know how to reach it.
[357:16.15]Is this like the end of the game?
[357:20.17]The second Guardian Stone was entrusted to a vicious ogre.
[357:24.01]He's too strong for any mere mortal to beat.
[357:31.82]Oh, this is second to last level.
[357:33.39]Oh, shit.
[357:36.81]This level's doing really hard.
[357:42.71]The whole game's been kind of like that.
[357:49.40]This is everything we know.
[357:50.86]Please help us in our plight.
[357:53.22]You have all of our support, Holy One.
[357:58.00]Oh, the fireballs have stopped.
[358:00.69]For now, at least.
[358:04.41]Okay.
[358:06.49]Fireballs have stopped.
[358:07.45]Have they, though?
[358:11.35]I mean, this is... I don't know.
[358:14.46]This is annoying and loud and all over the place.
[358:18.72]Disciple builder.
[358:19.96]I don't like this level.
[358:21.68]It's too loud and flashy.
[358:24.12]Disciple builder.
[358:32.09]Alright.
[358:36.78]Defeat three gods to control the realm.
[358:38.80]Defeat another god.
[358:40.14]Defeat three gods.
[358:41.02]I just want to see what it looks like.
[358:48.32]Oh, there he is!
[358:48.80]Oh, this is huge.
[358:57.06]What do we got over here?
[359:04.08]Do you not have a... What the fuck is that?
[359:08.94]Do these guys not have creatures?
[359:09.86]I don't think they do.
[359:26.22]Fog of War?
[359:26.94]Maybe.
[359:29.49]Alright, don't go too far.
[359:30.37]Let me just see.
[359:31.43]We got... What do I need?
[359:35.11]What do I have?
[359:36.09]Temple.
[359:36.48]There's a graveyard.
[359:38.84]There's... Where's he going?

[359:45.98]Zerg rush him with mega milk.
[359:47.82]That's not his name You can scroll through some of these info signs to read all the text Hold the action button on the text and move up or down.
[359:57.74]I know I know any information I know I know I know I know I know I know added to the library in the temple Let's just we need food.

[360:36.97]Well, can I play too?
[360:55.73]That's a zebra.
[361:02.94]Get over here.
[361:05.80]Why are you running away from me?
[361:10.20]Wait, you have two?
[361:15.02]You've got a big turtle?
[361:16.62]Where'd you get all these people?
[361:22.63]Let's just hang out.
[361:23.27]You want to hang out?
[361:26.92]We don't have to hurt each other.
[361:30.06]We don't have to do anything bad.
[361:31.24]We don't have to hurt anything.
[361:34.14]We can just be friends.
[361:39.05]What are you doing?
[361:42.35]You don't like me?
[361:45.57]I look kind of pissed off.
[361:53.56]I just gave him food!
[362:05.52]Cool.
[362:06.78]Look, we don't even need to hurt each other.
[362:09.36]What's this whole conquering thing?

[362:55.89]Is there another god down here?

[363:26.64]Stop leaving me out!
[363:27.90]Stop excluding me!

[363:29.58]What's he doing?
[363:40.67]Water?
[363:50.74]He's being friendly.
[363:52.18]I could just sit here and watch this for like 20 minutes.
[364:00.56]In fact, that's what I am doing.
[364:01.80]Alright, go talk.
[364:14.56]Go make some friends.
[364:28.91]Hey, what is he, this is, is this his?
[364:53.71]This is his town.
[364:59.04]Who am I fighting?
[365:02.32]Who am I fighting?
[365:03.40]Wait.
[365:03.90]Oh, okay.
[365:26.40]Ooh, big roundhouse kick.
[365:37.77]Get him.
[365:39.19]Right in the stomach.
[365:41.42]Are my hands on fire?
[365:44.96]Heal.
[365:45.94]Do a heal.
[365:51.46]Heal.
[365:54.75]We're both on fire.
[366:38.50]That's the end of the stream.
[366:40.12]I'll see you later.
[366:43.50]I'll see you tomorrow.
[366:45.86]Why was the turtle kicking the shit out of his own house?
[366:53.46]Pizza tier list?
[366:54.24]Alright, I'll do a pizza tier list before I go.
[367:02.82]Uh, black and white, that was fun.
[367:05.51]Today was a little more grindy than I would have wanted it to be, but we still got some, I think, at least 9 out of 10 moments.
[367:14.93]It was very, very fun.
[367:16.25]The game's fucking hilarious.
[367:17.31]It's a classic.
[367:22.42]And I might move on to 2 for the next one.
[367:28.40]Get the expansions.
[367:29.42]I don't know if the expansions will work.
[367:35.86]It might be hard to get to work.
[367:39.42]I'll look into it.
[367:41.72]Creature Isle is pretty fun.
[367:42.80]Yeah, that was fun.
[367:50.05]I love the little creatures.
[367:50.99]I wish they just made a game where you could just do this.
[367:55.49]You know?
[367:56.17]I wish there was a little creature town.
[367:57.99]And there was a bunch of creatures.
[367:59.25]They could get along.
[368:00.25]They would fight.
[368:02.69]I love this.
[368:04.48]So much.
[368:05.12]I love it.
[368:09.97]Spore.
[368:10.69]But spore is not like this though.
[368:15.67]There's no cow in spore.
[368:22.88]Make one?
[368:23.44]What do you mean make one?
[368:26.94]Just buy a couple of ant farms.
[368:29.99]Nah, we'll move on to the second one.
[368:31.67]Or maybe the expansion.
[368:33.65]But obviously not immediately.
[368:36.35]Tomorrow what we're going to do, we're probably just going to do Katana ZERO tomorrow.
[368:39.51]Because I've been putting it off for like two weeks.
[368:42.63]So we're going to do Katana ZERO tomorrow.
[368:46.79]After Katana ZERO, we'll have to see.
[368:50.00]I'm not sure.
[368:50.80]There's a lot of things on the menu.
[368:54.64]Probably No More Heroes 2, yeah.
[369:00.78]But that's going to wrap it up for tonight.
[369:04.52]Play Viva Piñata?
[369:05.64]I could do that.
[369:10.65]But this has been a lot of fun.
[369:12.35]I hope you guys have enjoyed it.
[369:14.07]It's an old, old game.
[369:16.63]And we'll see you tomorrow.
[369:20.58]Out of wilds, I know, there's a lot.
[369:23.60]There's a lot of games to play.
[369:29.30]If you can get a copy of Black and White, I highly recommend you try to get it installed and play it.
[369:34.59]Because it can be pretty fun.
[369:39.25]See you guys tomorrow.
[369:49.51]Seems like a perfect place to stop it.
[369:53.74]Don't forget the pizza.
[369:54.44]Alright, where is it?
[369:56.56]Give me the pizza tier list.
[370:02.01]Alright, let's go over this.
[370:05.90]Just give me one second.

[370:08.46]Here, here, here.
[370:11.34]Okay, what should I do here?
[370:16.00]Pizza toppings.
[370:21.89]I need this to be a different window.
[370:23.29]Alright, now that this, I can do this.
[370:30.81]This is going to be, this will be easy.
[370:33.32]This won't take very long.
[370:41.72]Alright.
[370:42.08]Let's get this window open.
[370:43.55]There you go.
[370:46.37]Pizza toppings tier list.
[370:50.73]Why is it capturing that weird fucked up window like this?
[370:55.21]What?
[370:58.80]Pizza toppings tier list.
[371:00.06]Yeah.
[371:00.42]What the fuck is it going to say?
[371:01.82]What the fuck?
[371:09.48]Okay.
[371:14.19]There is this.
[371:16.69]How many are on here?
[371:21.87]Kind of a lot.
[371:23.37]Is it eggs?
[371:24.46]Why are there eggs here?
[371:26.90]Who puts eggs on pizza?
[371:28.34]What are you doing?
[371:40.71]Shrink it a little bit more.
[371:41.69]Okay, that's fine.
[371:43.37]That's fine.
[371:43.83]Alright.

[372:06.15]What is that?
[372:07.89]yogurt
[372:12.95]Olives?
[372:14.00]No.
[372:14.66]Not on pizza.
[372:16.78]Hot peppers?
[372:17.74]I can't eat them anymore, I would.
[372:19.06]Ketchup on pizza?
[372:22.66]What is this tier list?
[372:27.04]Avocado pizza?

[373:28.00]Give me a new list.
[373:29.16]This list is bogus.
[373:31.62]This is a bogus list.
[373:32.94]Absolutely.
[373:34.44]This one's bogus.
[373:37.48]Hold on.
[373:38.00]Close that.
[373:38.72]Give me a new one.
[373:42.68]Is this one correct?
[373:45.92]I mean, this one's, this one's closer than this one was.
[373:54.78]Okay.
[373:55.94]Bacon.
[373:57.42]Yeah, this, this is closer.
[373:58.52]This is closer.
[374:01.02]Imagine eating a healthy pizza.
[374:02.45]Imagine, imagine putting walnuts on your pizza.
[374:07.85]I'm sorry.
[374:08.27]That's just, that's odd to me.
[374:10.11]Imagine corn.
[374:10.97]Alright.
[374:12.33]Bacon.
[374:12.69]Here we go.
[374:13.45]Uh, I'm going to move this stuff around.
[374:14.53]Is this steak?
[374:16.67]I wouldn't put steak on pizza.
[374:19.21]Peppers.
[374:19.63]I don't like peppers on pizza.
[374:20.71]This is... This is chicken.
[374:22.96]It can be okay.
[374:23.56]Depends.
[374:23.98]I don't know.
[374:24.90]Eggplant.
[374:25.44]No.
[374:26.50]Broccoli on pizza is actually okay.
[374:31.10]Pineapple.
[374:32.00]I don't put it on pizza.
[374:33.42]This is fresh parmesan.
[374:34.80]I don't know.
[374:35.16]I don't know what some of this stuff is.
[374:41.02]Mushrooms.
[374:41.48]Mushrooms are good.
[374:43.39]Where's pepperoni?
[374:44.81]Pepperoni.
[374:45.55]The right stuff.
[374:48.01]Onions are good.
[374:51.23]Parmesan is good on pizza.
[374:52.44]I don't even know what this is.
[374:53.42]Is it Parmesan?
[374:54.48]Let me get the list ready.
[374:56.20]Spinach on pizza.
[374:57.00]No, thank you.
[374:58.44]Jalapeños, I can't eat it.
[375:00.86]I can't.
[375:02.44]Why is corn on this list again?
[375:06.38]I'm so... Is it sausages?
[375:11.95]Sausages, alright.
[375:12.81]Let me get this correct.
[375:15.97]What is this?
[375:18.86]What is that?
[375:19.24]Is it crab meat?
[375:29.02]No thanks.
[375:31.94]That's bogus.
[375:33.66]Olives.
[375:35.38]And was this garlic or what?
[375:37.04]Tofu?
[375:40.21]Is it garlic or tofu?
[375:45.91]Croutons.
[375:46.61]What is this?
[375:50.16]You don't put garlic bread on pizza.
[375:53.51]You guys put croutons on pizza?
[376:01.55]It's probably garlic.
[376:02.41]Alright, hold on.
[376:04.35]Let me get this right.
[376:05.30]Pepperoni, onion, bacon goes up here.
[376:08.22]Chicken's up.
[376:09.70]It belongs above bacon, in my opinion.
[376:11.34]Broccoli goes up there.
[376:13.60]Mushrooms are okay.
[376:16.16]I'd rather have garlic...
[376:18.80]then bell peppers are just basic and it just tastes like water I don't like them parmesan can go up here the tomatoes the pizza sauce is made of the tomatoes I don't know this is supposed to be steak well I can tell you I'd rather have pineapple on pizza than steak on pizza
[376:52.60]These are down here that I can't eat them, but they just seem odd to me.
[376:55.87]They're anchovies.
[376:59.13]Odd taste?
[376:59.53]No, they're not.
[376:59.99]That looks like a cut-off steak.
[377:10.58]No, I think this is pretty close.
[377:15.22]See, everyone that's saying that Parmesan, what's wrong with you?
[377:17.08]Parmesan's incredible.
[377:17.89]Parmesan is a great masking of bad pizza.
[377:21.55]If you dump Parmesan cheese all over your slice of pizza, it's because the pizza is not very good.
[377:28.82]And you're making it taste better.
[377:37.36]That... You don't have to put a bunch of Parmesan cheese on a really good high quality slice of pizza.
[377:50.00]It's like sriracha laughing my ass off.
[377:57.87]That's incorrect.
[377:59.97]It's a child flavor palette.
[378:07.69]Because I don't want to put corn on my pizza?
[378:13.05]I can't believe you put eggplant down in F tier.
[378:21.11]When was the last time you guys ordered eggplant on your pizza?
[378:32.17]Probably never.
[378:36.21]Oh yeah, what do you want for pizza?
[378:38.17]Okay, if I'm the child, then you're the person that nobody wants to order a pizza with, okay?
[378:44.60]Oh, let's get a pizza.
[378:45.74]Yeah, what should we put on it?
[378:47.20]How about eggplant and spinach?
[378:49.33]It's like, get the fuck out of here.
[378:50.89]I don't, what?
[378:51.55]I don't want to order a pizza with you.
[378:55.54]Yeah, maybe we should put corn and crab meat on it.
[378:58.96]You can get your own pizza, actually.
[379:00.64]Now that we think about this.
[379:05.48]I don't want that.
[379:07.99]Why jalapeños down here?
[379:09.27]Jalapeños would be up here.
[379:11.81]But I can't eat them anymore.
[379:13.51]I physically can't do it anymore.
[379:21.27]You know what I was thinking?
[379:22.05]Yeah, instead of pepperoni, onion, or like bacon, chicken bacon, or sausage, or broccoli bacon, broccoli chicken, I want corn and anchovies.
[379:33.06]I'm going to just tell you honestly, guys, you will be somebody that has to order your own pizza.
[379:41.90]No one's going to want to share this pizza with you with corn and spinach on it.
[379:55.84]I don't want... Olives.
[379:58.26]I like olives.
[379:59.14]I like olive oil, but I don't like olives.
[380:02.27]Just eating olives.
[380:03.79]They don't belong down here, though.
[380:06.59]I would probably... I'd rather have olives on my pizza.
[380:12.43]Than... Yeah.
[380:14.32]No.
[380:15.56]No.
[380:17.96]No, I actually wouldn't mind it if it was on it.
[380:20.82]I would eat it.
[380:22.26]I don't love it.
[380:23.04]I don't really like it, but I would eat that slice.
[380:25.22]This is stuff that I wouldn't eat if it was on pizza.
[380:38.09]Pineapple is higher than spinach.
[380:39.67]I mean, yeah.
[380:44.45]You've never had spinach on pizza then?
[380:46.45]Oh, I have.
[380:47.43]I have.
[380:47.77]It's great when you bite into a slice of spinach on it and the spinach comes off and peels off like the lid of a yogurt.
[380:54.48]And it's like stuck on your mouth and you...
[381:05.05]somebody I know at least a few you know what I'm talking about it's it's like that solid it just pulls off and like slaps you in the mouth and it's like the shape of a yogurt lid pineapple on pizza sucks
[381:29.09]I just, I don't, I would say, number one, I would want pepperoni.
[381:33.52]Or, um, peppers probably should be a little higher than this.
[381:43.68]Because, like, peppers, mushrooms, like, I don't, I don't, you know, I don't think so.
[381:47.94]I don't think so.
[381:49.25]I don't order sausage on my pizza, ever.
[381:52.57]I don't.
[381:56.74]I love, onion on pizza is incredible though, I love onion.
[382:03.20]Yeah, I think that's more accurate.
[382:04.48]If this is garlic, then it's more accurate.
[382:06.72]Now it is.
[382:09.52]No, it's not.
[382:10.72]Okay, that's safe now.
[382:14.45]Explain your olive hate.
[382:19.31]I don't, they, just regular olives just taste like acid.
[382:34.98]To me, they taste sour and acidic.
[382:42.06]Olives are just bitter and gross.
[382:43.70]I mean, I'm not going to say they're gross.
[382:45.62]Olive oil is amazing.
[382:47.72]I put olive oil on everything.
[382:53.78]You're so based and epic for this.
[383:06.49]You are so based.
[383:09.97]Okay, you brown noser.
[383:11.85]Hey, leave him alone.
[383:13.69]Leave him alone.
[383:14.27]Just because he didn't want corn on his pizza.
[383:16.19]Leave him alone.
[383:16.71]Alright.
[383:35.82]Okay.
[383:41.80]right you passed the test you passed the test okay you passed the test I thought if I put uh bacon down here people are gonna freak out and I was gonna call you hypocrites okay more and more that I think about this I wouldn't I don't order sausage on pizza
[384:14.15]I don't know how to mushrooms either on pizza.
[384:17.57]I do sometimes, but not as much as I would get it.
[384:20.57]That's accurate.
[384:21.83]Alright, I'm done.
[384:25.57]Why broccoli?
[384:26.05]Have you ever had broccoli on pizza before?
[384:27.37]It's amazing.
[384:31.35]That was done.
[384:35.45]Dog food?
[384:40.21]Why would I do a dog food tier list?
[384:41.76]I've never eaten it.
[384:44.87]Dog food?
[384:46.95]Do I have a tier list?
[384:55.07]Wait, hold on.
[385:05.28]I'm not doing this.
[385:06.04]This is just dumb.
[385:08.24]Like, this is just bizarre.
[385:16.51]Best Hot Pockets?
[385:17.77]I can do this one really fast.
[385:21.59]Okay, you ready?
[385:22.59]Let's do Best Hot Pockets.
[385:24.68]This one's gonna go real quick.
[385:27.94]Okay, Best Hot Pocket.
[385:57.25]Okay.
[386:01.47]Where is the meatball marinara?
[386:05.09]Where is it?
[386:05.37]I know it's here somewhere.
[386:06.43]Meatball marinara?
[386:07.31]Where is it?
[386:13.60]That's it right there, right?
[386:17.66]And where's the steak and cheese one?
[386:19.36]It's the steak with the cheese and the peppers and the onions.
[386:21.94]Where's that one?
[386:26.46]Right here?
[386:31.21]Okay.
[386:32.05]Alright.
[386:38.35]Why do we got to do hot pockets like this?
[386:44.76]Oh, and it was a ham and cheese.
[386:46.20]Was it?
[386:46.40]Where's the ad?
[386:46.88]No.
[386:47.06]It's the ham and cheese ones right here, right?
[386:48.32]Yep.
[386:49.06]Okay.
[386:49.50]That's correct.
[386:50.04]That's actually accurate.
[387:01.84]What about the four cheese?
[387:02.80]No, the rest of these you should never eat them.
[387:08.45]He's eaten all of them.
[387:09.77]No.
[387:10.87]I've eaten most.
[387:11.53]Is that chicken pot pie?
[387:13.33]Oh, gross.
[387:21.67]I have eaten the ham and cheese one.
[387:22.85]I've eaten the... I've had some of these and I just don't want... No.
[387:27.11]These are the only ones that are really that good.
[387:31.01]about the breakfast one no no don't eat Jimmy deans instead Jimmy dean makes much better breakfast sandwiches I would rather have a Jimmy dean frozen sausage egg and cheese than a hot pocket egg and cheese burrito thing
[387:57.87]People eat these?
[387:58.39]I thought there was a meme.
[387:59.63]No, I used to eat these all the time, especially these three.
[388:03.55]All frozen fruit is gross.
[388:05.07]Ah, I don't know.
[388:05.55]I don't agree with you there.
[388:07.91]It can be okay.
[388:11.95]Best Oreo flavors.
[388:12.93]I can do this one, because hopefully... Okay, if it's on the list, I will put it five times higher than everything else.
[388:20.30]Is it on the list?
[388:22.00]No, this is an incredibly... This is a terrible list for Oreos.
[388:24.98]Is there a better one with all the Oreo flavors?
[388:30.85]There's got to be a better one than that.
[388:33.47]Is this one on it?
[388:35.33]Nope.
[388:36.13]Not on it.
[388:44.18]Oreo.
[388:44.42]Here's another one.
[388:45.12]What about these ones?
[388:49.44]No.
[388:50.34]The moon marshmallow ones are not on here.
[388:52.38]It's the best one you can possibly eat.
[388:55.96]The marshmallow moon.
[388:58.54]It was limited time.
[388:59.74]They were the best.
[389:05.90]Alright, I'm gonna get out of here.
[389:11.32]Fat asses, hey.
[389:16.58]Ooh, is it on here?
[389:19.74]No, no, no, no, no, it's not on here.
[389:26.52]Cool Mint Oreos, okay, yeah.
[389:29.03]Cool Mint, oh, those are good.
[389:30.81]But there's no Moon Oreos.
[389:34.33]I don't even need to open this.
[389:37.14]Cool Mint Oreos.
[389:39.45]Um, Birthday Cake Oreos.
[389:43.45]I don't like Double Stuff.
[389:44.33]Double Stuff would be an F tier because it's just too much.
[389:46.47]It's just too much in the middle and just gross.
[389:48.97]Yeah.
[389:49.63]That's my list.
[389:58.66]Cool Mint's pretty good, yeah.
[390:00.14]Alright.
[390:01.20]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[390:01.92]We're gonna do Katana ZERO tomorrow.
[390:09.16]Made about the sleeve of Oreos.
[390:10.28]Yeah, they weren't double stuffed Oreos.
[390:13.22]Thanks for sticking around for watching Black and White.
[390:18.74]Made some great memories with the cow.
[390:21.58]And now, I'll see you tomorrow.
[390:26.31]We're gonna do the subs and the bits and everything.
[390:28.07]There was a new Twitch feature that was apparently tested today that dumped another fucking, like, almost thousand dollars on the channel.
[390:40.08]In an instant.
[390:42.70]More than that.
[390:44.62]So, thanks again, everybody, for that.
[390:46.83]I'm gonna try to go over them.
[390:49.35]Because that was insane.
[390:52.65]There's a new hype train thing.
[390:55.19]Where if a certain amount of money comes into the channel, it activates this... I don't know.
[391:00.00]It was bizarre.
[391:02.82]But, this is where it started.
[391:06.74]Thank you, everybody, and especially thank you, Sir Flukeslot, thanks for the five gifted subs.
[391:13.34]Brotescules, thanks for the five subs.

[391:33.31]I didn't even know what it was.
[391:40.15]What was it?
[391:43.93]Jonathan Rakes tells you you're wrong for 47 seconds.

[392:26.52]Can't wait to watch how you handle level three on the VOD.
[392:31.28]Love ya.
[392:32.92]Well, we... We handle it.
[392:37.93]If you're here now in the future, it was kind of a pain in the ass.
[392:44.95]Spent an hour following a guy around a cliff.
[392:50.46]Desperately watched the one thing that I loved in the game be tortured for five hours.
[393:02.06]But we did finally get our revenge.
[393:03.74]We got our vengeance.
[393:10.59]That level was painful.
[393:14.81]In a lot of regards.
[393:18.69]And I lost the dance battle.
[393:19.85]Yeah, that's horrible.
[393:23.20]Poor Murius.
[393:25.06]It's okay.

[394:01.63]That's going to be a nightmare of a night, I think.
[394:11.07]Didn't somebody say, if I don't beat the... Okay, somebody said in Fellowship of the Ring, with the first or second level, if I actually beat the first or second level, that they'll donate like $100 or something?
[394:23.80]Somebody said something like that.
[394:24.84]What was it?
[394:31.80]I didn't record their name.
[394:32.66]I don't know who it was.
[394:34.92]They made a really bold statement.
[394:36.61]They said, I don't think he's going to get to the end of the first level.
[394:47.49]We'll find out.
[394:51.67]I don't know what their name was.
[394:54.35]I wrote it down.
[394:55.99]Somewhere, maybe.
[394:58.57]But, yeah, we do have some stuff here.
[395:06.42]You said you wrote down his name because he said you'll never beat the first level.
[395:10.12]Yeah, but didn't I say clip it?
[395:12.90]Here it is, right here.
[395:15.04]What did they say?
[395:18.49]okay hold on it was a guarantee by the way they guaranteed it you literally won't get past the first part of fellowship I guarantee it alright I wouldn't alright I wouldn't remember your name because when I get past level one in fellowship of the ring I'm going to fucking scream your name what was the name it's fake what

[413:16.32]Thank you I'm that's awesome that you're on a set on a feature film set right now and you're doing your own shit.
[413:26.31]I
[413:30.35]The best thing you can do is just keep punching at it.
[413:34.48]See if it takes you anywhere.
[413:40.52]You can't win unless you try.
[413:46.87]There is... What did Yoda say?
[413:52.13]Do or do.
[413:53.40]Don't do or do not.
[413:55.88]Do or do not do.
[413:57.24]There is no try.
[413:58.52]Something like that, right?
[414:00.14]This is a Yoda quote.
[414:01.20]Do or do not.
[414:01.90]This is my yearbook quote, by the way.
[414:06.95]I swear to fucking god.
[414:08.77]Do or do not do.
[414:12.43]Do or do not.
[414:14.55]There is no try.
[414:16.97]That was my yearbook quote from Yoda.
[414:19.31]But that's not even accurate what I'm trying to say.
[414:22.99]What I'm trying to say is try...
[414:26.24]What if that's a terrible quote?
[414:27.32]No, it's not.
[414:29.14]That's Bruce Lee?
[414:31.24]Do or do not.
[414:33.09]There is no try.
[414:35.91]That's Yoda!
[414:36.81]What does that mean, Bruce Lee?
[414:43.29]Listen to Yoda.
[414:55.56]alright I'll give it a try no try not do or do not there is no try listen to Yoda it was Bruce lee vaude instantly got deleted look at me doing that voice no I'm not gonna even try him that was me doing that voice
[415:27.08]I could probably do it.
[415:27.79]Hold on, I'm gonna mute.
[415:44.80]I just tried it like six times.
[415:46.00]It's not gonna work.
[415:52.40]Listen to Yoda, though.
[415:53.18]Seriously.
[415:55.31]Yoda's got some good advice.
[415:57.37]Try.
[415:58.71]Do it.
[416:00.41]Don't do it.
[416:01.39]Don't.
[416:01.89]Try.
[416:02.93]Try it.
[416:05.09]Do Yoda's voice.
[416:07.05]No.
[416:09.05]I don't know.
[416:10.10]If you think that I inspire you to do anything, I'm happy that that's the case.
[416:16.18]I hope it's a force for good.
[416:24.57]Hey, very nice.
[416:25.41]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[416:27.15]Jeremy, sorry for missing the New Year's stream.
[416:28.79]Don't apologize for ever missing anything that this stream ever does.
[416:33.24]You're under no obligation to ever be here.
[416:37.50]So don't worry.
[416:39.00]I'm feeling a bit bummed out at the moment because I didn't manage to get into an overseas study program that I was looking forward to.
[416:44.39]Now I'm a bit directionless.
[416:46.59]Not sure where I want to go next.
[416:48.09]Any words of wisdom?
[416:55.22]Try again.
[417:02.66]Try again.
[417:10.20]But there is no try.
[417:11.45]Who told you that?
[417:12.87]Alright, I'll give it a try.
[417:14.99]No.
[417:16.19]Try not.
[417:17.53]Do.
[417:19.31]Or do not.
[417:21.05]there is no try alright yeah you're right um I have to go against Yoda on this one for a second uh any words of wisdom for real though without any like jokes or anything I would probably say to honestly to try it again I don't know how old you are but
[417:47.67]If you have something that you want to do, overseas study programs, correct me if I'm wrong, are actually kind of difficult to get into because they only take a certain amount of students, right?
[417:57.92]So it's actually not something, I don't think I would be too upset about it because it's such an exclusive, hard to do.
[418:07.16]They only take like, what, 30, 40, 50 students a lot of times.
[418:11.16]It's incredibly difficult and it's incredibly expensive.
[418:14.40]Now, also remember that.
[418:19.01]If you do an overseas program, you may have just increased the amount of money it takes for you to go to school by, you know, times three.
[418:28.37]So, they do a lot of good.
[418:36.32]Where am I going with this one?
[418:37.20]What do you mean?
[418:38.42]I'm just saying that it's expensive.
[418:43.16]And it's hard to do, hard to get into.
[418:46.51]Overseas tuition is cheaper if you live in America.
[418:48.53]Wait, what?
[418:50.92]The overseas study program, not going to college in another country.
[418:55.56]You go to college in one country and you do a study program in another country.
[419:01.86]You don't like go to college in the other country.
[419:05.63]It's a study program for a school that's in the country of origin.
[419:11.27]I'm confused.
[419:12.39]What did you mean by this?
[419:17.38]Yoda, Yoda, what should I do?
[419:20.15]Do.
[419:21.93]Or do not.
[419:23.67]There is no try.
[419:24.79]Alright, thanks Yoda.
[419:35.60]Move to a country with better college prices.
[419:43.15]Yoda would recommend... Get him?
[419:46.35]What?
[419:47.19]Yoda would recommend drugs?
[419:59.87]No, I really wish I had something better to tell you.
[420:02.95]But... You can try it again.
[420:11.90]That's a meme now.
[420:13.80]No.
[420:17.74]Stop saying ketamine.
[420:19.24]What is ketamine?
[420:20.26]What is it?
[420:23.50]What is ketamine?
[420:26.52]It's an anesthesia or something.
[420:28.22]Don't take fucking anesthesia without a doctor prescribing it for you to pull your teeth out or go in your body and touch your liver and rip out your organs and stuff.
[420:36.63]Don't do that.
[420:47.51]Anyways, Strakus, thanks for the $5.50.
[420:50.05]Thanks for the $5.50.
[420:51.17]Fahima, thanks for the $2.50.
[420:54.15]Hey, Jeremy.
[420:56.05]Can't watch the stream due to family medical emergency.
[420:59.88]I'm sorry to hear that.
[421:02.92]I need to say this for a Community Night video.
[421:06.50]It's a spoiler for Dragon Rampa.
[421:09.10]I'm scrolling by.
[421:10.28]What if I play it?
[421:11.35]I'm not going to say that.
[421:12.37]I'm not even going to say that.
[421:13.23]I scrolled by it.
[421:20.64]Thank you, though.
[421:21.30]Thank you, Razlik, for the thousand bits.
[421:28.84]Jerem, I took your advice on just having fun with streaming, and now it's been going for a couple months, and today I got affiliate.
[421:36.05]Hell yeah.
[421:36.63]Nice work.
[421:38.21]I'm actually more comfortable for talking for long periods and meeting new people.
[421:42.67]And I hope to make better content.
[421:44.89]If the future, in the future, I'm still nervous, but boy, if the future I'm still nervous, but more excited than ever.
[421:51.60]So thank you for the advice as simple as it may have been.
[421:53.72]It means so much hearing it from you.
[421:56.80]Can't wait to see your plans for 2020.
[421:58.96]Thanks a lot, Razzler.
[422:01.88]Hope your streams go well.
[422:05.49]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[422:15.56]The thing about my advice, though, guys, is it's a fucking miracle I can even get myself out of bed.
[422:22.56]You know what I mean?
[422:24.32]I get lost in my own bathroom.
[422:26.18]I don't even know how to tie my shoes correctly.
[422:49.04]I wish you all the best though, all of you.
[422:54.96]I can't even tie shoes.
[422:56.04]See, you get it.
[422:57.41]I know you do.
[423:05.09]Sometimes we're all Sims setting a grilled cheese on fire.
[423:08.40]Alright, make that, have that be your, can I take that and have that be my senior quote?
[423:17.37]That's a great one.
[423:18.47]That is fantastic.
[423:19.45]That is the most accurate statement I've seen all day.
[423:29.94]Thank you, Chef Gooby, for the five subs.
[423:33.14]Thank you, Chef Gooby.
[423:35.26]Flavius... There's no music.
[423:36.67]This is...
[423:38.64]Thank you Flavius Dalmatius for the $2.50 Jerma.
[423:41.37]Remember that time you got mad?
[423:42.77]It was like two hours ago, I remember.
[423:48.09]Gnarly thanks for the $2.50.
[423:49.05]It's fucking loud.
[423:52.37]A while back I asked about classic SNES RPGs and you told me to play Chrono Trigger.
[423:56.83]I got it a week ago and it's pretty great.
[423:59.12]Thanks for the recommendation.
[424:01.12]It's one of the best games ever made.
[424:03.44]You're welcome.
[424:05.74]Also, if you didn't use Frog in your playthrough, I want my bits back.
[424:09.04]Why?
[424:09.40]How would I not use Frog?
[424:14.00]He was in every party.
[424:14.80]I'm gonna bounce into you here.
[424:24.99]StixRenegade, thanks for the 250.
[424:26.45]When is the tire oil change stream?
[424:28.53]You have to learn how to do these things.
[424:29.87]Hey, Chad, did you know Jerma doesn't even know how to put gas in his car?
[424:43.52]That's not real.
[424:45.16]So it's okay.
[424:46.88]But... No, I don't... We already went over this.
[424:51.04]This was a huge point of contention last night.
[424:56.06]A lot of people were upset by this, but we brought up real statistics that only 18% of everybody in the United States changes their own oil.
[425:09.61]So, I'm okay with being part of 82% of every person that goes just to fucking Jiffy Lube for like 20 minutes.
[425:18.54]I don't care.
[425:21.70]Make fun of me all you want.
[425:25.10]He's a normie.
[425:33.43]I don't change my own oil.
[425:34.79]What a normie.
[425:41.41]The bar for what is and isn't your normie, I feel like it's getting muddled in 2020.
[425:46.83]You know what I'm saying?
[426:02.98]Okay, boomer.
[426:04.12]Okay, boomer.
[426:08.46]Jerm is a damn normie, guys.
[426:10.56]Beta.
[426:15.57]What do you mean beta?
[426:19.05]Did you see how hard I bit my controller during Simpsons?
[426:24.07]What was I just going to say?
[426:25.05]I was going to say Simpsons Rise and Shine.
[426:30.85]Simpsons Hit and Run.
[426:42.06]BobaSwag, thanks for the 500 bits.
[426:43.66]I'd watch a sitcom of the Super God Best Friends crew.
[426:47.30]I would too.
[426:49.86]Chump T, thanks for the 300 bits.
[426:51.79]DansGame.
[426:52.99]If you love pineapple on pizza, you are a psychopath.
[426:56.45]No, people just like things and people don't like things.
[426:59.33]Can't we just all like things that we like?
[427:02.91]Can't we all just like things and not everybody has to like the same damn thing?
[427:10.40]Why is it so bad to be different from each other?
[427:13.08]Why is it so bad?
[427:16.35]No, we all must enjoy pineapple pizza.
[427:19.55]All of us.
[427:27.26]Everybody's different.
[427:28.70]Who gives a shit?
[427:36.30]Pineapple on pizza is a sin.
[427:38.80]You like broccoli, actually.
[427:43.56]Fuck this stupid normie boomer.
[427:47.04]Oh, yeah?
[427:48.86]This stupid normie... nom... nomie... Your name is fucking me up!
[427:54.72]Yoken, man.
[427:56.26]I couldn't even say it because I was looking at your name.
[427:59.26]I'm banning you for one minute.
[428:00.38]I'm banning you for a minute.
[428:01.62]I'm banning you for one minute.
[428:02.66]I have to.
[428:03.75]I have to.
[428:04.17]I have to show.
[428:04.71]I gotta show that I'm fucking alpha.
[428:06.43]You know what I mean?
[428:06.89]I gotta ban you.
[428:07.59]What's your name?
[428:09.27]What was that person's name?
[428:12.25]What's that person's name?
[428:17.68]Yor... Yor... Yorkin?
[428:29.06]This is a beta move.
[428:30.65]No, this is an alpha move.
[428:32.05]Because I'm... The York... The Yorkin Man?
[428:36.11]Wait, hold on.
[428:37.25]No, it's not.
[428:39.67]Orc... The... The Orkin Man?
[428:42.42]The Orkin Man is like a pest control.
[428:49.08]Ban Orkin Man.
[428:58.72]Keep typing.
[428:59.32]Hide him.
[429:00.00]You're... Whatever.
[429:02.36]Just know that I'm pointing at you.
[429:04.05]Just know that I'm pointing at you.
[429:06.01]That's super beta.
[429:07.03]Fuck.
[429:08.35]I'm pointing at you right now and I'm angry with you.
[429:10.75]Okay.
[429:18.85]Hey, man up with PsyHot.
[429:21.12]Thanks for the 400 bits.
[429:21.94]Thanks for streaming.
[429:22.58]Hope all is well.
[429:23.26]Things are going pretty well.
[429:24.18]Thank you.
[429:27.08]Appreciate that.
[429:28.69]Somnus RGL.
[429:31.47]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[429:33.63]A Jerma recently went to the doctor and came back with a pretty scary diagnosis.
[429:36.43]Turns out I'm incredibly allergic to cute people.
[429:41.08]Achoo.
[429:42.02]Sorry about that.
[429:43.38]Oh, man.
[429:44.06]Ow.
[429:53.75]You spelled out achoo, and it's like, God.
[429:57.51]That's fucking ridiculous.
[430:00.11]What's this person's name?
[430:01.57]I gotta ban him for one minute.
[430:06.13]That's right, okay, hold on.
[430:08.37]Just know that I'm looking at you.
[430:11.65]Thanks for the 500-bit, seriously.
[430:13.03]Blueberryman.
[430:14.31]I like that name because it has Bugleberry in it.
[430:17.55]Let's get the credits rolling.
[430:23.51]Look at these fucking subs.
[430:30.05]Don't just wait.
[430:30.91]Bugleberry will be back again.
[430:33.65]You know, I guarantee Jeremy won't beat the first level in Fellowship of the Ring.
[430:39.20]I guarantee Bugleberry makes another appearance within the next year.
[430:45.34]I guarantee it.
[430:58.60]So not this year.
[430:59.34]No, no, no.
[431:00.30]Within 2020.
[431:01.56]You'll see him again.
[431:04.62]Wow, who could have guessed?
[431:05.74]ResidentSleeper.
[431:07.10]He'll wake you up, don't worry.
[431:10.22]Hey, Shadows1Disciple, thanks for the $2.50.
[431:13.18]What are we looking at here?
[431:15.82]I don't know.
[431:19.71]What is this?
[431:20.97]It's a screenshot of... What is it?
[431:23.69]Is the cow flipping off somebody?
[431:26.19]Is somebody really sad?
[431:38.91]I don't get it.
[431:39.39]What is it?
[431:47.09]Oh, the sky!
[431:51.92]I didn't even see it.
[431:53.86]Thanks, though.
[431:57.76]But thank you, Shadows One Disciple, and then thank you, Blueberry Bugleberry Man, for the 500 bits.
[432:04.20]I found you from the Jerma is Mad Star series.
[432:08.25]I've loved you ever since.
[432:09.81]I wonder how many people have actually found this channel through those videos.
[432:19.86]They were fun.
[432:22.44]And right at the very end, we had Snoozencopter.
[432:24.34]Snoozencopter says, for 250 bits, there is no end video.
[432:31.97]Because, for some reason, I'm stupid and don't have it.
[432:35.39]Let me fix that very, very quickly.
[432:39.07]Let me fix that very quickly.
[432:44.14]How much time do you close?
[432:52.42]Close it.
[432:54.55]Close it dark.
[432:56.01]Close it about dark.
[432:57.33]Dark is not the time.
[432:58.01]What time do you close?
[433:02.07]Now is not the time.
[433:02.81]What time do you close?
[433:07.75]Who's talking right now?
[433:08.91]Oh, right, Susan Copter.
[433:13.31]Wait, hold on, wait a second.
[433:17.75]I have no idea what this says.
[433:19.77]I'm not reading what this person said.
[433:21.82]This is not the bit message.
[433:23.46]I really have no clue what they are trying to say.
[433:26.04]Gotcha.
[433:30.75]No country for bald streamers.
[433:33.55]No, for real, thanks for not forgetting God Hand.
[433:35.57]Still looking forward to it.
[433:36.81]I'm going to be disappointed if you don't beat it.
[433:38.47]It's a hard game.
[433:41.39]Got it.
[433:41.61]You have to call it.
[433:42.85]I can call it for you.
[433:45.01]Well hedged then.
[433:47.46]Well done.
[433:48.34]Well done.
[433:55.04]Can you please, for the love of God, turn down Bilgeberry's reverb?
[433:57.76]No.
[434:02.59]It's going 1% higher next time.
[434:09.01]For every time somebody says, turn down Bugleberry's reverb, I'm increasing it by half a percent.
[434:16.92]Fuck you.
[434:17.72]Fuck you.
[434:18.46]Fuck you.
[434:18.96]Oh my god.
[434:19.58]I didn't think I was going to get this kind of response.
[434:26.28]Of course I'm gonna turn the reverb down.
[434:28.56]I didn't even know it was that loud.
[434:29.92]I wasn't even- I couldn't hear anything.
[434:32.14]I'm sitting over there screaming into a pod.
[434:34.06]I don't know the reverb's that loud.
[434:35.60]I had no access to that audio.
[434:44.15]Every time a viewer leaves, turn it up.
[434:49.07]That was me?
[434:49.99]No!
[434:51.39]I was not available.
[434:52.59]I was on my break.
[434:55.20]What, I can't take a break during the middle of a stream?
[434:57.08]I was... I was screaming into the pot!
[435:04.85]I was sitting on the toilet and I was fucking having some trouble!
[435:11.82]That's what I meant by that.
[435:24.68]See you guys tomorrow.
[435:26.80]First time on stream, so it's totally not.
[435:29.90]Respool, thanks for the $2.50.
[435:31.88]Been watching since 2012.
[435:32.64]Hope you have a good day.
[435:37.78]Thanks.
[435:38.34]Welcome.
[435:39.88]Welcome to the stream.
[435:44.07]I'm drinking green tea.
[435:45.27]Drink it with me.
[435:45.97]I need to go get some more green tea.
[435:48.05]I don't have any more left.
[435:55.99]But I'll see you guys tomorrow for probably Katana ZERO.
[435:58.59]Or I might last minute lie to you guys and just hook up to PlayStation 2 and do Fellowship of the Ring.
[436:03.83]It might be a mystery.
[436:06.33]The plan is Katana ZERO.
[436:15.76]He's gonna lie.
[436:17.96]Here comes the lie.
[436:19.40]Uh, where's my stupid fingers?
[436:28.18]I'll see you guys tomorrow.

[436:46.01]Tons of support, tons of incredibly nice things that they have said about this community and about this stream.
[436:53.05]Let's go say hi to BoxBox.
[436:56.00]Let's- let's go!
[436:59.86]I've been waiting for an opportunity to... Because some of these people that have raided the stream... I'm never live when they're live.
[437:08.77]Go say hello.
[437:10.37]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[437:11.21]Take care of yourselves.
[437:13.48]And good night.
[437:29.41]Thank you.
