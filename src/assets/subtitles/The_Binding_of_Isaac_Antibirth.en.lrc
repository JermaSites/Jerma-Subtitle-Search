[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.19]I almost just fell down through my ground.
[00:07.00]How you doing?
[00:11.04]Welcome back to the stream everybody.
[00:15.50]MonkaS, what?
[00:19.03]Hold on, is there something wrong?
[00:26.35]What's wrong?
[00:29.02]What do you mean not again?
[00:36.67]Hold on.
[00:38.37]What's the matter?
[00:45.41]Hello?
[00:46.68]Why is this doing this?
[00:51.10]There's no sound effects on.
[00:53.26]There's no... Okay, this... I don't know what just happened.
[00:58.32]I don't know what happened.
[01:00.20]What I do know is now it's gone.
[01:02.64]And...
[01:08.23]On the GoXLR, there's an effects button.
[01:11.07]You can press it.
[01:13.87]I didn't press it.
[01:16.85]It shouldn't be doing that at all.
[01:21.39]That button was not pressed.
[01:24.69]We're good now?
[01:25.39]We sound fine?
[01:27.22]We're good, right?
[01:27.70]This is a good audible level?
[01:29.20]I think we sound fine.
[01:32.44]Let me turn this off.
[01:34.10]Okay.
[01:34.22]Okay.
[01:35.82]Where's the shoe?
[01:36.40]Yeah, I know.
[01:38.32]I can address the shoe situation in just a moment.
[01:42.31]Just wait for people... People have to trickle in first.
[01:47.72]Uh...
[01:49.10]Whatever, I'm just going to talk about it right now.
[01:50.37]You can link to this if you want.
[01:52.63]The shoe-eating stream had to be postponed because there's been obviously a lot of panic in the grocery stores.
[02:04.25]There's been a lot of the national emergency being called, countries being locked down.
[02:10.50]It was actually kind of not on the priority list the last three or four days.
[02:16.95]Actually, it was probably going to be pretty hard to get somebody to make a comedy shoe.
[02:21.89]So... Kind of like the bakery that I was going to use was not really... It was kind of hard to do that the last two or three days.
[02:35.92]I was going to have a fucking comedy shoe cake made, alright?
[02:39.30]That's the joke.
[02:40.32]And now it's... What am I supposed to do?
[02:43.77]I have to tell you the joke, what it is.
[02:49.80]Now you have to eat a real shoe.
[02:52.27]I'm not eating a real shoe.
[02:54.05]You can make 15 accounts if you want.
[02:56.31]Dermal lied about eating a real shoe.
[02:59.27]And plus, it was a me costume, by the way.
[03:02.87]I don't have to eat a real shoe.
[03:04.03]I can eat like a fucking ring pop if I want.
[03:12.85]Eat shoe.
[03:13.69]I'm not going to eat a real shoe.
[03:16.46]Why would I ever eat a real shoe?
[03:19.74]Think about this.
[03:20.76]You guys have to process this information.
[03:23.68]Imagine eating a shoe.
[03:26.67]You can't eat a fucking shoe.
[03:31.87]You said.
[03:32.61]How many fucked up things have I said on this stream?
[03:38.25]You can't eat a shoe.
[03:39.39]I'll have to go to the hospital if I eat a shoe.
[03:42.32]I'll die if I eat a shoe.
[03:43.78]If you eat a shoe, you die.
[03:45.42]Right?
[03:48.31]Like, you can't just eat a shoe.
[03:51.03]Leather is edible.
[03:52.01]You want me to go buy, like, leather shoe?
[03:54.05]I'm like, no, leather.
[03:54.85]No, no, no, no.
[03:55.71]I'm not.
[03:56.05]Why do I?
[03:56.43]I'm getting a little worked up now.
[03:58.03]I gotta calm down.
[03:58.76]I'm not eating a fucking real shoe.
[04:02.22]I'm not eating a fucking shoe.
[04:07.06]I had, like, a comedy routine planned out, and it kind of fell through.
[04:12.84]Doesn't mean I'm not going to do it.
[04:14.23]Okay, I will eat a comedy shoe within the next two weeks.
[04:23.51]I'm not going to eat a real one.
[04:25.17]I'm not spending any more time on, like, eat the fucking shoe.
[04:28.80]I'm not going to spend any more time on this.
[04:34.12]Don't talk about... Why are people talking about that?
[04:36.48]That's pre-stream chat spoilers.
[04:38.02]Come on.
[04:43.13]Just have them make... You can eat leather shoes if you boil them.
[04:50.14]No, you can't.
[04:51.78]No, you can't.
[04:53.46]No, you can't.
[04:55.30]You can't eat shoes.
[04:57.30]No, you can't.
[05:00.40]I'm not eating your fucking shoe.
[05:04.45]Okay, here you go, guys.
[05:06.23]I will eat a shoe if there... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[05:10.97]I'm not fucking going over this.
[05:12.89]I'm not going to boil a pair of leather shoes.
[05:18.78]I love the... The best response to this is, in all capitals, look it up.
[05:25.09]Yeah.
[05:27.27]I could eat the t-shirt that's on me right now, probably.
[05:29.67]If I boil it and remove the ink.
[05:32.69]Am I gonna do that?
[05:34.57]No, it's very bad for you.
[05:36.05]It's probably so bad for you.
[05:43.08]Eat a shoe, you poser.
[05:45.92]You can't call somebody a poser for something that literally no one has done on stream.
[05:51.63]I wouldn't be the poser.
[05:52.77]I'd be the first guy that's fucking ever done it.
[05:56.06]That's not a poser.
[05:56.72]I'd be the first guy.
[06:09.39]Okay, TL;DR.
[06:12.41]He's a Reddit user.
[06:14.11]TL;DR.
[06:17.09]Some of the purchases I would have wanted to make and the coronavirus has caused a lot of widespread kind of panic and people buying a bunch of shit, grocery stores locked down, places like, you know, it's not, it wasn't on the priority list the last two or three days.
[06:33.18]It's been difficult.
[06:34.36]We're trying to get through this shit.
[06:37.28]That's an excuse.
[06:38.77]It's not, though!
[06:42.59]Preparing for, like, a... Alright, let me give you a list of things.
[06:49.07]Preparing to eat a comedy shoe versus prepare for a global pandemic.
[06:55.44]Which one of those two things is more important, do you think?
[07:00.86]I mean, we gotta get some priorities somewhere.
[07:10.57]Alright.
[07:10.99]We're gonna play Binding of Isaac.
[07:22.48]This doesn't mean that I'm not gonna eat the comedy shoe, okay?
[07:25.86]Just pretend that we just gotta... You gotta give me some time.
[07:37.65]Alright, I'm going to go over something real quick.
[07:41.63]Real quick.
[07:43.67]So there are lines out the door at all the grocery stores and all the bakeries and stuff.
[07:47.84]But I say I lump bakeries into the grocery store because I'm a fucking liar.
[07:51.90]But there are literally lines out the door for the grocery store.
[07:54.04]People are freaking out, buying like water, buying like thousands of dollars in groceries.
[07:58.32]And I was going to have this bakery in the grocery store make this.
[08:02.04]Imagine the guy walking in there.
[08:03.58]It's like, oh my God, we got to get toilet paper.
[08:05.56]We got to get water.
[08:06.74]We got to get fucking, we just buy a bunch of frozen foods.
[08:10.23]There's hundreds of hundreds of people, thousands of people in these grocery stores.
[08:13.81]And I'm the guy that walks up to the bakery counter and is like, hey, can you make me a fake funny comedy shoe?
[08:26.54]Excuse me, sir.
[08:27.43]I gotta deal with something over here.
[08:30.45]Can you make me a funny shoe cake?
[08:34.25]Uh, sir?
[08:35.97]Do you look around?
[08:37.23]Yeah.
[08:41.68]Sir, this is a fucking global emergency.
[08:43.94]I need you to make me a funny cake today.
[08:47.52]Anyways, welcome to the stream.
[08:51.78]Take care of yourselves.
[08:52.38]Be careful.
[08:54.98]Actually, actually be careful, right?
[08:59.63]Do your own due diligence.
[09:01.45]Take care of your friends and family members, especially the older ones.
[09:03.61]Because, you know, but this is the real deal.
[09:07.61]You know, you can't fuck around.
[09:09.47]Just be careful.
[09:22.48]If you have shoes in your house, eat them.
[09:24.12]Alright, we're over the eating shoes thing now.
[09:29.28]I'm excited for this because I haven't played Binding of Isaac in a long time.
[09:34.58]This is Antibirth.
[09:36.98]We talked about this last week.
[09:39.64]A lot.
[09:41.22]And, you know, when you get something in my brain, shit becomes... I can't get it out.
[09:49.18]My mic is going in and out?
[09:50.56]What is wrong with this fucking thing?
[09:53.44]what hello hello alright there we go shouldn't be doing that there's a one guy moment alright fine anyways um we're gonna play Binding of Isaac but this is gonna be a gamer stream I haven't been one of these in a long time
[10:20.91]What was the last Jeremy plays a video game and doesn't walk into walls and stuff?
[10:26.95]How long ago was that?
[10:34.03]It hasn't happened.
[10:34.61]Mario?
[10:35.95]Two streams ago, was it?
[10:39.27]Sekiro?
[10:39.69]Oh, it was alright.
[10:42.35]Mario was okay.
[10:44.79]But it was probably Sekiro.
[10:45.77]This is the first time.
[10:47.71]Alright.
[10:51.64]When does the official... Now, here you go.
[10:53.46]I know, go ahead and laugh.
[10:54.86]Like, make fun of me.
[10:56.00]This is an old save file.
[10:58.70]Yes, okay.
[10:59.92]Hadn't even beaten the game on hard with Eve yet.
[11:02.26]I know.
[11:02.90]You can laugh.
[11:05.40]This is like an old rebirth file.
[11:06.90]I just want to make sure that I didn't have to beat mom's heart like ten times.
[11:15.81]This is an old rebirth save file that got pulled.
[11:20.81]I don't even know who these two are.
[11:23.43]Minus five.
[11:30.80]When you play Binding of Isaac, you just, if you don't, by like the third floor, if you're like, nah, nah, this ain't working.
[11:38.86]You just quit.
[11:40.83]Why did I say that?
[11:41.45]People are going to make fun of me.
[11:47.29]You gotta go all in.
[11:48.97]Fine, y'all.
[11:49.37]We'll go all in.
[11:49.89]Alright, who do I want to play with?
[11:52.28]Kayn?
[11:53.26]I got nothing on hard of beating up with Kayn.
[11:56.88]I can literally do anything with Kayn.
[11:59.00]Let us pick.
[12:00.60]We'll do Kayn.
[12:02.46]This is the Antibirth mod, by the way, and soon it's going to be official.
[12:06.26]I don't know when, though.
[12:08.32]I really actually don't know.
[12:09.36]And why is the start button getting pressed over and over again?
[12:12.14]Alright, it's been a while.
[12:17.09]Uh, dude, this is ante-birth, not afterbirth, just so you know.
[12:19.71]Yeah, this is ante-birth.
[12:22.76]Ante-birth.
[12:26.08]This is not afterbirth.
[12:28.98]Reset Randy.
[12:31.31]Second or third quarter this year.
[12:32.45]Really?
[12:32.59]Really?
[12:35.03]So, I actually, I don't have, like, really any experience with Antibirth, so you guys are gonna have to help me.
[12:40.54]Let me actually, I know people are gonna, no, people, no one's gonna make fun of me for this.
[12:44.56]I have that Platinum God cheat sheet up to know what items do.
[12:49.74]I, this is just how it works.
[12:50.84]Alright, let me get this, uh, let me get this split up, actually.
[13:01.33]The cheat sheet.
[13:02.25]Eat the cheat sheet.
[13:03.59]Print it out and eat it.
[13:04.97]Print out the cheat sheet and wear it on your feet.
[13:08.04]Like, wrap it up around your feet.
[13:09.58]Take it off your feet and eat the shoes.
[13:11.96]Wait a minute.
[13:14.18]Okay, what if I, like, get, like, two pieces of ham and, like, wear them as shoes?
[13:18.08]Do those count as shoes?
[13:20.28]And then eat the shoes.
[13:21.04]Does that count?
[13:26.81]Oh, that's disgusting.
[13:27.87]No, I'm not doing that.
[13:29.67]It technically would count, but I'm not doing it.
[13:34.36]Alright, let's, uh, let's go.
[13:37.85]No, not yet.
[13:41.77]Okay, now we can go.
[13:44.05]Eat the... I'm not even gonna say what you just wrote.
[13:48.53]Alright, let's go.
[13:51.97]Look at how much time is left.
[13:52.88]Only a minute and forty has gone by.
[13:55.10]I gotta, like, beat the clock.
[13:59.40]Kane starts with the luck foot, right?
[14:05.13]You know what?
[14:05.49]It's actually weird.
[14:06.14]It's been a long time since I've played this on a big screen.
[14:10.24]I've played this on the Switch a shitload.
[14:14.20]It's weird to not have this played in a tiny window.
[14:18.87]Why can I not... Is there no extra HUD on Antibirth?
[14:28.53]I like having that HUD on the left.
[14:33.38]Oh, if anyone wants to see, there it is.
[14:34.78]Play along with me.
[14:36.70]Fucking go.
[14:37.58]Oh my god.
[14:38.34]Uh, Ankh.
[14:41.96]Eternal life.
[14:43.04]You can die once, right?
[14:46.47]Fucking go.
[14:47.27]Alright, I'm gonna step on this once.
[14:51.19]That was a mistake.
[14:53.01]I don't have any bombs.
[14:58.29]Go!
[14:59.07]God damn it!
[15:00.79]Holy shit, relax!
[15:01.56]Relax!
[15:07.24]Is this a new enemy?
[15:07.88]What is this guy?
[15:11.91]Oh my fucking god.
[15:13.11]Go.
[15:13.19]I'm gonna die.
[15:21.29]I've never seen these enemies before.
[15:22.39]These are new.
[15:22.83]Oh!
[15:27.65]And why did I use that in here?
[15:28.93]I can use the sacrifice room now.
[15:32.99]Saved by the hematemesis.
[15:39.84]Alright, wait, can I... Do I have to be in the room the whole time?
[15:44.11]I don't think so, right?
[15:46.05]Can I just do it?
[15:46.85]Can I just go up and just hit... Oh, come on.
[15:51.93]Alright, give me another heart.
[15:56.07]Yeah, I can go back and forth, right?
[16:06.42]I'm gonna get a chest here, right?
[16:12.32]Shouldn't I have gotten something by now?
[16:15.40]It resets.
[16:20.98]I'm kind of scared to do it again.
[16:22.12]Because I'm going to have one heart.
[16:27.40]You have to die.
[16:28.34]Guys, I know what this room does.
[16:31.33]Okay, but it didn't... I think you have to be in the room the whole time.
[16:45.68]It was risky, but I did it.
[16:49.02]I like to see the stats on the left.
[16:51.78]You don't.
[16:52.72]Leaving is fine.
[16:53.32]It's just random.
[16:53.94]Well, that kind of sucks.
[16:55.04]I just got completely... That was bogus.
[16:58.90]I just hurt myself like six times.
[17:00.98]It's time to fucking reset.
[17:02.12]You know what I mean?
[17:07.17]This baby plum.
[17:10.19]I can fuck away from you.
[17:10.95]I don't know what you do.
[17:15.78]I know what you do.
[17:17.46]Get away, get away, get away.
[17:23.26]Holy shit.
[17:27.97]This is an exclusive Antibirth enemy.
[17:32.03]This fucking mod has been out for like two or three years.
[17:34.45]Alright, I'm gonna die.
[17:35.19]Don't talk.
[17:35.53]This is not a comedy stream.
[17:48.55]Okay.
[17:50.87]I almost just died.
[17:52.93]This is HP and regen up.
[17:54.77]Ooh, say it.
[17:56.35]Nice.
[17:56.81]Say it.
[17:57.33]Cool.
[17:57.53]I almost just got hit.
[18:01.18]Yeah, but that's the first time I've seen that.
[18:02.50]It's pretty good for the fucking first time ever seeing that enemy.
[18:05.46]I want to see people clapping in this fucking chat.
[18:09.68]Let's go.
[18:13.34]Go back to the sacrifice room?
[18:14.39]No.
[18:17.06]Fucking go.
[18:17.82]Play.
[18:18.76]Jesus, man.
[18:19.40]It's been five minutes.
[18:20.91]I hate the darkness.
[18:34.33]You know the things I hate the most in this game?
[18:35.85]I hate the curse of the blind.
[18:36.82]I hate the curse of darkness.
[18:40.64]Oh, I hate these guys, too.
[18:41.90]I hate these enemies.
[18:43.56]They're so fast and erratic, I hate it.
[18:45.12]And then some of them explode.
[18:46.10]Ew, really?
[18:49.56]What's this do?
[18:51.11]Goat hoof.
[18:51.69]Speed up.
[18:52.23]Is that all it does?
[18:52.89]Look it up.
[18:54.05]On my cheat sheet.
[18:57.85]Goat hoof.
[18:59.23]It's just... Oh, that's it.
[19:00.29]That's actually what it does.
[19:05.37]Alright.
[19:05.57]That's not... How is that just cheating?
[19:06.53]What do you mean, cheater?
[19:08.27]Oh, so I am speed.
[19:09.07]I'm going faster.
[19:09.65]Cool.
[19:14.29]Whoa!
[19:16.17]I hate the spiders.
[19:17.39]They are the worst.
[19:21.69]Oh, there's TNT right there.
[19:22.85]Alright, careful.
[19:23.45]Not a big deal.
[19:25.21]Fine.
[19:28.64]Fucking die!
[19:29.46]Oh, shit.
[19:36.64]God damn it!
[19:37.26]I'm trying to explode this thing.
[19:38.32]I can't see where it is.
[19:39.20]Alright, I'm fine.
[19:46.27]Alright, I'm good.
[19:48.43]This is Bob's brain?
[19:50.45]Common cold.
[19:51.39]Poison damage.
[19:54.59]Wow, that's lucky right there.
[19:56.85]Oh, that's super lucky.
[19:58.31]Wow.
[20:00.85]Common cold.
[20:02.01]Blow these up.
[20:02.57]I know I'll fucking do it accidentally.
[20:09.23]This build sucks.
[20:10.15]Like, this is a shit build so far.
[20:13.82]Come on, I'm dead.
[20:19.54]If you say I'm dead, then like everyone knows that's watching the stream.
[20:23.20]They go, oh, he's dead.
[20:24.18]Like, yeah, it's a horror.
[20:25.08]He's gonna die.
[20:25.89]And then when I don't die, it's like, oh, nice.
[20:27.85]He didn't die.
[20:30.53]I use that same tactic when I'm by myself, too.
[20:35.53]Instantly take all pills.
[20:37.43]I know.
[20:37.83]And I just... What's the point of even holding... What's the point of holding the trinket now?
[20:42.83]The trinket's just... I want to see my stats!
[20:46.17]Should I blow this up and... Yes.
[20:49.03]why would I why I asked that question god damn it what is it I thought I was gonna get keys I want keys well I can get two I can get two I gotta save this for now oh I should have had you blow up over there curse of darkness
[21:17.48]I didn't even know it was over there.
[21:19.60]Whatever.
[21:19.90]Okay, keep going.
[21:26.00]He's not even good at this game.
[21:29.10]Shut up.
[21:31.96]I'm doing fine.
[21:32.96]What has happened?
[21:33.64]I'm just playing Binding of Isaac.
[21:36.60]He's not even good.
[21:38.40]You can't even make that judgment yet.
[21:40.04]This is a shit build.
[21:44.83]Here we go.
[21:50.47]F10.
[21:51.23]F10.
[21:51.81]F10.
[21:52.45]F10.
[21:53.57]F10.
[21:54.79]Why is everyone saying F10?
[22:00.63]F10.
[22:01.89]Why?
[22:02.19]What am I doing F10 for?
[22:09.75]Press F10.
[22:12.84]I'm not going to press F10 because I don't know what it does.
[22:16.80]Clubs or keys or clubs or bombs?
[22:18.10]Which one?
[22:18.60]I know you get two.
[22:23.35]I'm not ready for that yet.
[22:25.90]It's for stats.
[22:30.02]No, it's not.
[22:35.32]That didn't do anything.
[22:38.44]Did I just take like a screenshot?
[22:51.09]What is F10 supposed to do?
[22:57.36]F10, F10, F10.
[22:58.34]I just pressed it like four times.
[23:02.71]We got him.
[23:06.73]He's already playing hard mode, you geniuses.
[23:10.90]Wait, is that supposed to change it to hard mode?
[23:12.72]I'm already in hard mode.
[23:19.61]Oh, they added the stats in after birth, right?
[23:21.59]And you can't do them both at the same time.
[23:23.09]Alright, do I... What is the club?
[23:25.47]Is clubs bombs?
[23:26.75]Clubs is bombs, right?
[23:28.53]There's hearts, clubs, spades is keys, right?
[23:34.11]I want this.
[23:39.89]Look at that.
[23:43.03]Now I got infinite bombs.
[23:49.96]Alright, did I, uh, where's the secret room?
[23:51.98]Over here?
[23:52.48]Secret room probably right here.
[23:53.94]Let's check it.
[23:56.68]We got our free bomb, might as well try and use it.
[23:59.72]Fuck.
[23:59.90]I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go down.
[24:05.55]I want another key.
[24:10.05]Oh.
[24:13.85]No.
[24:15.15]No, I need two keys to get in there.
[24:16.61]No.
[24:17.03]No.
[24:21.44]No!
[24:22.22]Reset it.
[24:22.72]No, don't reset it.
[24:23.54]It's fine.
[24:29.46]Shit.
[24:29.80]I'm actually really... This is usually really, really good.
[24:31.80]Third rock?
[24:33.58]You mark rock.
[24:35.39]Yeah, I... I knew what I... I should have known what I was getting into.
[24:38.47]When I was like, I'm going to play Isaac today.
[24:41.81]If you say you're going to play The Binding of Isaac, what you actually are trying to tell your chat is scream in all capitals MISSED ROCK every time you see one.
[24:53.57]I can't get in here.
[24:56.71]Don't get mad.
[24:59.65]Where's this mist rock?
[25:06.11]Nice.
[25:07.97]Nice eyes.
[25:09.45]How did you see that and not me?
[25:10.83]It's because I'm playing the game.
[25:13.27]You're not playing the game.
[25:19.45]There's no damage up items.
[25:20.59]This, like, really actually is bad.
[25:21.83]There's another one?
[25:23.62]I can't... How am I supposed to blow it up?
[25:24.86]I don't have anything.
[25:29.40]Missing rocks.
[25:30.83]I can't blow them up!
[25:42.65]Alright, so I brought this up like a few streams ago.
[25:44.39]And I didn't really give it much thought until very recently and maybe even today.
[25:52.62]Is this one of my most favorite games ever made?
[25:56.22]Is this like on the list somewhere?
[25:57.52]I think it is.
[25:58.02]I think it has to be.
[26:02.88]I keep coming back to him playing this game, like, hundreds of times.
[26:07.01]I don't do that with anything else.
[26:08.31]I used to do that with, like, Team Fortress, and, like, that's it.
[26:11.45]How could this not be on that list?
[26:19.05]Ooh, you've got a devil.
[26:20.66]Don't go in there.
[26:22.40]Oh, this build is really bad.
[26:26.30]Range up.
[26:27.40]You hate to see that.
[26:31.46]Wait, what?
[26:34.05]You really hate to see that And these are all awful We got a familiar that shoots with me spectral tears or Guy it that item is I'm not why would I get that?
[26:51.12]That item is just guaranteeing you're gonna die eight times I'm not taking that Hey guppy, why would I take that?
[27:02.04]You get one heart and it's just, I'm gonna die nine times and then I'm gonna have to reset.
[27:06.48]Not if you're a gamer.
[27:07.37]Copy transformation.
[27:10.03]Yeah, but that's not guaranteed.
[27:24.21]Wrong order, idiot.
[27:25.19]What are you talking about?
[27:26.34]What do you mean, wrong order?
[27:32.87]Why would I get it?
[27:33.93]I don't know.
[27:34.57]Because this build sucks.
[27:36.71]So this is like a who gives a shit build.
[27:39.55]You could have taken all three.
[27:42.63]What do you mean take all three?
[27:45.91]Press F6 or F7 for stats.
[27:47.51]Somebody confirm that before I press it.
[27:51.14]Wouldn't it just kill me?
[27:51.88]I don't know what that does.
[27:59.76]Oh shit.
[28:00.36]Okay, that just freaked me out.
[28:06.18]I googled it.
[28:09.72]That's our inoptions.
[28:10.58]No, they're not.
[28:12.72]Hold R. I know what that does.
[28:13.94]It doesn't work like the original Flash Isaac.
[28:23.29]Wait, what?
[28:27.09]We're going for Guppy, because that's the only way that this works out.
[28:32.64]What do these, um... What do these, like, little, like, white things on the ground do?
[28:37.64]Are these, like, collectibles?
[28:39.78]I'm not supposed to be making any jokes.
[28:43.00]That was a mistake.
[28:43.72]This is a no-joke stream.
[28:47.10]That was not even funny.
[28:48.58]What are these co- I was trying to think of what looks like this.
[28:51.06]I was gonna say marshmallows, and then I just said collectibles.
[28:53.48]Holy shit, that was very bad.
[28:55.86]Oh, are these collectibles?
[28:59.05]That was bad.
[28:59.79]That was desperate.
[29:02.44]What are these things on the ground?
[29:03.50]I think it's something that's small and white.
[29:05.12]Something small and white.
[29:07.14]Collectibles.
[29:14.33]I've never seen these guys before either.
[29:15.57]These things are crazy.
[29:16.21]What was that laugh?
[29:24.27]These pictures are fucked up.
[29:25.66]This is where I die.
[29:34.38]When you see, like, three or four champions in a room, you just accept that you're going to die.
[29:38.94]But I guess I didn't.
[29:39.86]Alright, remind me to blow this up when I get Bob's brain back.
[29:45.93]F7, alright?
[29:46.59]I'm subbed.
[29:48.51]I'm not going to press F7.
[29:49.17]It's going to kill me.
[29:49.89]That's probably, like, the suicide button or something, right?
[30:00.42]Like, items that you have, you can, like, die and then maybe...
[30:04.37]Is there a die button in Isaac?
[30:05.61]I think there is.
[30:06.11]F7.
[30:09.79]I'm not going to press F7.
[30:14.32]There's no stats in this one because it's tied to rebirth.
[30:17.62]I'm on a mod right now, guys.
[30:19.47]What the fuck?
[30:20.11]Really?
[30:20.47]Yeah.
[30:20.77]I'll go in.
[30:22.01]Yeah.
[30:37.46]Just press it.
[30:46.26]They added it to Antibirth.
[30:47.64]F7!
[30:48.12]No, that's not what I want!
[30:50.79]I don't care about that.
[30:53.01]I care about the stats.
[30:57.37]F6.
[30:58.93]Oh.
[31:04.94]Alright, let's go.
[31:06.32]Blow up that rock.
[31:09.80]Okay, I'm gonna get two bombs and one key.
[31:13.20]Oh, well.
[31:16.88]Shit.
[31:18.74]It's the worst thing is that this... The poison tears, aren't they tied?
[31:23.45]It's tied to luck, how often it procs, right?
[31:26.47]Yeah, that's fantastic.
[31:30.03]Ooh, there's a... a demon heart.
[31:32.93]Watch out for these, these shi- AHHHHH!
[31:38.16]Oh, well.
[31:38.56]This run is egg-fucking-stupid.
[31:41.14]This run sucks.
[31:51.65]Hey, well, at least I can die ten fucking times.
[31:54.09]Wait, hold on a second.
[31:55.72]I have the ankh, too.
[31:58.24]So I have the ankh, and I can die ten times.
[32:01.98]Hahaha.
[32:05.13]That's so dumb.
[32:07.89]Oh boy.
[32:08.39]I don't know what these guys do when they die.
[32:14.43]Some of them explode?
[32:15.17]Oh, they just do the oil.
[32:16.03]Okay.
[32:18.13]No, you also shoot.
[32:25.32]What the fuck?
[32:26.92]One of them was a bomb.
[32:29.92]Whoa!
[32:30.50]Oh, that was a heal.
[32:34.63]This game scares the shit out of me sometimes.
[32:40.36]How come... How come Greed Mode's not in this?
[32:42.20]Because it has an Antibirth thing?
[32:45.46]I talked about this in the pre-stream chat.
[32:47.04]And I'm the only person in the world that likes Greed Mode, apparently.
[32:50.08]I thought it was, like, fun.
[32:50.88]I was like, oh, man, maybe I should... Pog!
[32:59.08]Greed Mode!
[32:59.60]And everyone's like, no, fuck you.
[33:00.72]Greed Mode sucks.
[33:01.82]Greed Mode.
[33:02.42]Fuck Greed Mode.
[33:03.12]I'm like, oh my god.
[33:06.46]I thought I was going to get like, oh, Paul, greed mode.
[33:09.04]No, you're not fucking up.
[33:10.12]That mode's dumb.
[33:11.18]That mode sucks.
[33:11.96]Delete it.
[33:14.25]Oh, fuck.
[33:14.75]Okay.
[33:15.41]Sorry.
[33:21.99]Open.
[33:22.63]Open.
[33:22.85]Look at my damage.
[33:27.12]420.
[33:27.18]That's it?
[33:27.92]I'm going to get this up.
[33:33.16]That's it.
[33:34.62]Chat hates greed mode.
[33:36.00]Yeah, why?
[33:36.58]What's wrong with it?
[33:41.70]Laughing my ass off.
[33:42.82]It's so funny.
[33:44.34]It's so funny.
[33:48.17]Oh, so that means... Oh, come on.
[33:53.11]The statistics.
[33:54.35]That's statistically impossible.
[33:56.13]That's not to blow up where I wanted it to.
[33:58.76]That's statistically not even possible.
[34:01.50]There was like 5,000 pixels of space of where that could blow up.
[34:09.99]Your luck is down.
[34:11.39]That doesn't mean anything.
[34:12.26]What is this?
[34:20.60]oh okay yeah I know people are going to be telling me not to do that and but it doesn't matter I take every pill instantly no matter what it is I don't care what it is if I see question marks it's being taken immediately there's no strategy here oh what's that glasses is this double shot oh yes it is yes okay run save
[34:51.47]run actually saved I need some HP up though hold r to save run ansa's vision does this open up the secret room so I I don't remember what these do oh I hate these guys I'm thinking of a different enemy
[35:25.05]Actually, this is not bad at all.
[35:26.05]I'm thinking of the ones that get up and they spit.
[35:29.13]Like, forward.
[35:29.69]I hate those guys.
[35:33.87]Still, this damage really actually sucks.
[35:36.33]Alright.
[35:38.71]Ah!
[35:40.59]What does Ansis do?
[35:41.29]It does the entire map.
[35:45.46]Yeah, let's go.
[35:46.30]No, wait.
[35:46.82]I should probably save this.
[35:48.46]I should save this for, like, when I go in the next round.
[35:51.32]Yeah, next floor.
[35:53.60]Alright, so where's the secret room?
[35:54.36]Let's see.
[35:55.60]Uh, secret room is either up here, down there.
[35:58.40]No, it's definitely over here.
[35:59.42]It's definitely that, that, that middle section, right?
[36:02.86]Has to be.
[36:05.32]It's like right here.
[36:06.56]Right?
[36:07.70]This is correct.
[36:12.97]Not.
[36:15.31]Damn.
[36:15.73]Okay.
[36:16.23]So what?
[36:20.01]So then it's over, uh, up?
[36:22.87]Up here?
[36:28.51]Bottom left?
[36:30.89]By the boss room.
[36:32.35]No, no.
[36:33.75]What a fucking idiot.
[36:40.04]I'm gonna stay here.
[36:42.48]God damn it.
[36:43.10]Secret room has to be surrounded by at least two... These guesses are perfectly fine.
[36:51.86]These are perfectly normal.
[36:53.42]This is how you decide.
[36:56.33]Grab the hearts.
[36:57.09]I can't pick up hearts.
[36:58.05]I have no heart containers.
[37:01.95]That was perfectly reasonable for me to think it was in the middle or up here.
[37:04.65]That's very reasonable.
[37:05.97]Look at this double shot.
[37:15.40]Dude, look at this fucking double shot.
[37:22.92]Oh, and there's poison on it too.
[37:23.82]Give me my luck back.
[37:25.56]Give me my luck back.
[37:27.52]And give me damage up.
[37:29.86]No.
[37:30.38]No.
[37:30.72]I mean, I can hurt people with this.
[37:37.59]I've gotten such shitty boss room item.
[37:39.21]It's alright.
[37:43.49]Do the challenge room?
[37:44.55]No, I don't do those.
[37:50.57]The bandage is insane.
[37:51.45]It's insane.
[37:53.31]Hold on.
[37:54.49]Can I use this and will it give me the sight?
[37:56.73]Will it remove the curse?
[38:00.86]No.
[38:02.64]Will it not?
[38:04.42]Come on.
[38:05.00]I hate this.
[38:06.54]I hate this because I lose track, especially when you get later on in the game.
[38:09.70]So we're going down first.
[38:18.58]Remember, we went down.
[38:23.74]What's the question mark mean?
[38:25.20]Under the question mark on the top right.
[38:26.82]What is that little red question mark in the box?
[38:29.62]Like the melted box.
[38:30.84]What is that?
[38:32.72]Is that the curse?
[38:36.84]Are we going right?
[38:41.16]Watch out for the... Ooh.
[38:43.35]Oh.
[38:44.41]Ooh.
[38:44.67]Oh.
[38:45.05]Oh.
[38:45.17]What am I watching?
[38:45.69]Like a fucking sports game?
[38:47.87]Oh.
[38:49.19]Ooh.
[38:49.37]Whoa.
[38:49.93]Oh.
[38:50.73]Oh.
[38:51.25]Oh.
[39:02.66]Just take this whole entire, like, however long this bot is.
[39:06.20]Just put it up next to, like, the Red Sox.
[39:10.19]No, no, no, no, no!
[39:11.13]Oh, come on!
[39:12.97]Come on, ref!
[39:15.89]There's gotta be, like, a referee in this game at some point.
[39:18.11]Like, a referee enemy.
[39:20.52]Oh, this thing's dumb.
[39:23.00]Come on, ump!
[39:26.24]There it is.
[39:29.19]I've seen a lot of minus twos on this.
[39:30.67]I think that's actually kind of a funny one.
[39:32.72]I think that's actually... I think that's kind of funny.
[39:35.22]I think that's funny.
[39:38.02]I can walk... I'm just... No, I'll lose... I'll forget where this is.
[39:41.48]Whatever.
[39:42.18]I'm gonna... I might need to cross.
[39:45.70]Ooh, here we go.
[39:48.53]Alright, do I go in here with the two keys, or do I use the two keys in the item room?
[39:52.89]We're going.
[39:53.47]We're going all in.
[39:55.27]And it was a fucking, the right call.
[39:57.49]Two of hearts.
[39:58.51]Stupid.
[39:58.85]Worthless.
[40:06.63]See, in my mind, they can't all be fucking bad in a row.
[40:09.75]They can't.
[40:12.67]But apparently they can.
[40:15.34]Two of hearts.
[40:15.88]Don't need it.
[40:16.90]Hangman's fine.
[40:25.74]This tier is down.
[40:27.64]Getting real close to resetting.
[40:35.23]What was... I still beat the game on hard with pain, right?
[40:37.91]That's the thing.
[40:38.55]There's not a log there.
[40:39.25]There's nothing over here.
[40:40.95]He's going to be reset Randy.
[40:42.33]No, not today.
[40:50.05]Now what do you guys do?
[40:51.87]I've played this game sometimes.
[40:59.05]Alright, is it weird for me to actually say that when you get tears down from a Pills, that is almost an immediate restart.
[41:06.47]No matter where you are in the game.
[41:08.15]Right?
[41:09.51]That's like an instant fucking just restart immediately, instantly.
[41:13.38]But I'm not going to.
[41:14.08]I'm not going to.
[41:15.62]I think I am going to do this though, because I need... No, I'm not.
[41:23.80]That's a child maneuver.
[41:27.02]Is that me being a child?
[41:29.51]Or is it me being realistic?
[41:34.56]Alright, we gotta go... We went down, right?
[41:36.82]I gotta go up.
[41:38.04]Wait, did we go left?
[41:40.52]No, we gotta go up.
[41:47.35]I might... Hold on.
[41:48.81]I might use the hangman over there.
[41:51.17]Get the fires or something.
[41:55.05]I forgot how much I like this game.
[41:59.21]I mean, don't get me wrong, I've played this a ton on my Switch, like, in bed.
[42:03.31]But, you know, sometimes you forget just how much you fucking like something.
[42:13.20]Didn't get hit one time, by the way.
[42:14.92]You know, a lot of you thought that room was going to be impossible to not get hit.
[42:24.67]Shit, I tried to sneak by.
[42:25.89]I got stuck on the rocks.
[42:29.27]tears down.
[42:29.95]The guy would have been dead already.
[42:34.35]What's that mean?
[42:38.94]What's that little... What's that little, like, insurance commercial jingle mean?
[42:54.38]Did I see something or find something?
[42:56.14]Why is it... I don't know.
[42:57.56]I've never played any birth.
[43:05.89]He doesn't know.
[43:07.17]I actually don't know.
[43:08.05]Tears down.
[43:08.71]Let me take it.
[43:09.23]I got extra blast.
[43:16.05]I know what the blast damage is, but that's pretty good.
[43:18.91]Wait, does that count for my active right now?
[43:21.97]That counts for the active, right?
[43:23.91]That's blast damage, technically, right?
[43:30.38]Or is it only bombs?
[43:35.29]Well, we're gonna get some free bombs.
[43:43.09]I forgot.
[43:43.75]It's okay.
[43:44.89]I forgot how huge... Okay, we're good.
[43:48.36]Oh, what is that thing?
[43:49.20]Alright, I have enough money for this.
[43:51.14]What is it?
[43:51.66]What is this thing?
[43:52.74]Alright, I gotta look this up on my fucking Platinum God cheat sheet.
[43:57.00]What's it called?
[43:59.73]Where is it?
[44:00.43]Uh... It's a cheater.
[44:06.57]You do the same thing.
[44:07.33]You can't keep track of everything in this game.
[44:11.94]What does it look like?
[44:12.54]It's a... It's like a face.
[44:15.98]It's a face with a bunch of needles in it.
[44:20.86]Where is this?
[44:23.10]Is this an Antibirth item?
[44:24.14]I don't see it anywhere.
[44:26.67]What does it look like?
[44:32.35]Yeah, I don't see that on my Platinum God list.
[44:38.25]Antibirth pickup, rebirth items.
[44:44.87]I don't see this on the Platinum God list.
[44:48.61]It's called Voodoo Head?
[44:51.49]Oh, there it is.
[44:53.51]This item has a chance to spawn additional curse rooms on each future floor.
[44:58.70]That kind of sucks.
[45:00.32]Oh, wait a minute.
[45:00.72]No, it doesn't, because of Guppy.
[45:09.81]Curse rooms are... Yeah, that's not bad.
[45:12.27]Because that's... Doesn't Guppy spawn in the curse rooms more often?
[45:19.49]Yeah, I'm going for it.
[45:20.15]Let's go.
[45:20.73]And give me some more money.
[45:22.13]I want more money.
[45:24.37]I'll just take it out of here.
[45:29.12]Okay.
[45:30.12]Hold on.
[45:32.00]No.
[45:32.14]Okay, I'm fine.
[45:36.82]Let's go.
[45:42.77]Oh, he's not dead?
[45:44.73]What?
[45:45.37]Oh, he's not dead.
[45:46.03]I thought he was dead.
[45:48.87]And tears down.
[45:51.17]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[45:54.71]That's not good.
[46:02.30]That's not good.
[46:08.76]Did I even get to the item room yet?
[46:10.08]I didn't, did I?
[46:13.02]What did I get in the item room?
[46:13.98]The bombs.
[46:14.60]Alright, okay.
[46:15.18]Alright, here we go.
[46:21.88]Oh, you fucking dumbass.
[46:23.66]I can't believe I missed.
[46:24.56]Okay.
[46:41.77]Alright, get out of here.
[46:43.35]There we go.
[46:44.01]Milk.
[46:49.45]Now we're cooking.
[46:53.28]Although there are hearts somewhere, aren't there?
[46:57.68]That's mega milk.
[46:59.38]Yeah, I'll let you have that one.
[47:01.14]I'll let you have that one temporarily.
[47:02.60]Oh, I don't even need hearts.
[47:05.51]Regeneration.
[47:07.21]Oh, the reveal item.
[47:08.19]Right, right, right, right, right.
[47:09.13]Don't want to lose that one.
[47:11.59]Was that down, down, right?
[47:14.77]I think.
[47:15.99]Wait!
[47:20.73]If I had any luck at all, this would be, this would be great.
[47:22.67]Is this fair?
[47:26.39]Ah, here we go.
[47:33.32]Why did I do that?
[47:33.92]What do you mean waste?
[47:36.82]I can only hold one item.
[47:40.26]I can't hold more than one item in my lower right.
[47:42.88]Look, see?
[47:44.62]I can't hold that.
[47:45.28]I've used it in the boss room.
[47:48.16]Why would I need to do that?
[47:58.21]To blow these up to get maybe a spirit heart?
[48:01.61]Maybe, but my luck is zero.
[48:03.03]I gotta save these bombs for bosses.
[48:06.06]That's my damage, man.
[48:11.24]My damage sucks ass right now.
[48:18.99]Don't click the link.
[48:19.89]I have no plan on it.
[48:20.73]Here we go.
[48:21.83]Bang.
[48:25.73]Oh, this is a double.
[48:27.85]Shit, this is a big one.
[48:28.83]Double.
[48:29.25]Alright.
[48:30.41]I love when you get a look at this.
[48:31.59]You know what I mean?
[48:32.03]Alright, we're gonna do the item rooms.
[48:35.09]Down, we'll do... Okay, I love this.
[48:41.82]Oh.
[48:43.46]How much damage did that not do?
[48:44.64]What?
[48:57.93]Didn't know you could do that.
[48:58.79]I was going to make a joke, say like, oh, here's a tip on Isaac.
[49:01.19]These guys can eat the bombs.
[49:03.33]But I feel like if anyone's played this game for more than an hour, they'd know that already.
[49:14.31]Ooh, gonna use that hangman right here, huh?
[49:24.99]It has to be greed.
[49:25.81]Of course it does.
[49:32.52]Oh, shit.
[49:33.08]Minions.
[49:33.40]I'm gonna get the alts.
[49:38.56]That's actually really, that's really good.
[49:41.17]I got a Steam sale from that.
[49:42.51]Everything's 50% off.
[49:44.01]What's this?
[49:44.37]Who cares?
[49:44.81]Take it instantly.
[49:45.61]Speed up!
[49:51.25]Hey, what?
[49:51.87]Those fire?
[49:52.93]I thought only the red ones did.
[49:55.51]What the fuck do those things do?
[49:56.71]Are they gonna keep doing it?
[50:07.30]I'm gonna forget.
[50:08.22]Oh, fuck.
[50:08.72]Oh, no.
[50:10.64]Okay, I gotta watch this.
[50:12.02]This reminds me of Mario Sunshine.
[50:19.23]What's the timing here?
[50:35.54]Down here.
[50:38.89]Okay, I got the timing.
[50:39.95]Ready?
[50:42.85]You have to go... Holy shit, that's bad.
[50:49.23]Use one of the bombs.
[50:53.24]Nice.
[50:56.69]Use the key.
[50:58.13]But I don't want to use the key.
[50:59.79]That's not cheating.
[51:00.51]Guys, I can die nine more times.
[51:03.28]I'll be alright.
[51:04.94]The way this is going to be a problem is if I don't have more than, like, two or three hearts going into, like, womb two.
[51:10.16]Oh.
[51:13.57]Jeez.
[51:22.67]I don't know the tech.
[51:23.65]I don't know the tech on these guys.
[51:25.65]I don't have the patterns down on them.
[51:26.73]I don't know the tech.
[51:42.08]Hey, what?
[51:45.24]Best item in the game.
[51:46.24]This run you should do.
[52:05.68]Haha, poop.
[52:06.42]Haha.
[52:07.94]Are you guys haha-ing Binding of Isaac?
[52:11.02]Poop?
[52:17.91]Pac-Man enemies.
[52:18.59]These guys suck.
[52:23.71]Let the poison kill him.
[52:25.45]Just let the poison kill him.
[52:28.30]Don't do anything stupid.
[52:29.08]Just let the poison kill them.
[52:37.53]I don't have any keys.
[52:38.95]Great.
[52:39.41]This is fantastic.
[52:41.89]They're inspired by The Legend of Zelda.
[52:45.80]I would say this game reminds me more of StarTropics than it does of Zelda.
[52:51.02]In fact, it's almost the exact same video game.
[52:54.27]Those of you that don't know what that is...
[53:00.96]I'm seeing a lot of question marks, but some of you guys don't know the beauty of one of the great... StarTropics is one of the... You don't know it.
[53:09.32]And it's sad that you don't.
[53:10.26]It's one of those games that nobody gave a shit about when it came out for the regular Nintendo.
[53:20.05]It is this exact video game.
[53:23.59]It's a boomer game.
[53:24.33]I don't know what it is, but it must be boomer.
[53:27.15]Right.
[53:27.35]Right.
[53:29.45]Right.
[53:41.54]MonkaS, I'm sorry.
[53:50.34]Take a room.
[53:52.44]And this is a super secret room, so that means you're gonna get... Oh, yeah.
[53:56.87]Don't pick that up.
[53:59.06]Those of you that don't know about Binding of Isaac, that is an eternal heart.
[54:02.66]If I pick that up, it's going to give me half of an eternal white heart.
[54:06.82]And as long as I do not take damage, that will remove that white heart.
[54:10.58]And I go to the next floor, I will gain one full heart container.
[54:18.27]Don't touch that until you... But wait a minute.
[54:23.51]Um... Aren't I about to fight... I'm going to fight Mom.
[54:26.95]Mom.
[54:29.14]You can't leave after you fight mom.
[54:31.51]Right?
[54:38.11]So... Just don't get hit by mom.
[54:39.63]Get it.
[54:39.85]I'm not going to get it right now.
[54:41.51]Get it before going in.
[54:42.83]I can do the first boss and then leave.
[54:44.92]I can at least do the first boss and if I take damage, you know, whatever.
[54:47.24]Fucking go.
[54:49.88]God, some of you guys.
[54:51.00]Some of you guys are so impatient.
[55:02.04]He's got to go now.
[55:06.69]I'm strategizing.
[55:12.21]Easy.
[55:12.37]Easy.
[55:12.53]I thought I was going to get a couple of those spiders.
[55:19.07]Don't.
[55:19.53]Just wait.
[55:20.09]Oh, my God.
[55:20.61]I'm freaking out.
[55:21.17]Why?
[55:26.81]It's hard to see.
[55:27.59]It's too dark.

[56:10.67]Yes it is, I win.
[56:18.54]Watch out, he's shooting at you.
[56:28.65]Just play the game, shoe eater.
[56:33.33]Don't make me laugh.
[56:34.63]There's an important video game being played.
[56:41.03]Alright, I'm an idiot.
[56:42.31]I'll... Okay, I'm good.
[56:57.45]We're good.
[56:58.61]I'm gonna forget that exists.
[57:00.21]Hate these guys.
[57:01.11]Hate these guys!
[57:01.83]Awww.
[57:05.69]Awww.
[57:07.46]Hoover.
[57:11.51]Oh, man!
[57:12.61]I can't even hit.
[57:16.85]Once a tuber, always a tuber, right?
[57:28.06]Hey, I think I can die eight more times.
[57:32.48]The rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock.
[57:36.16]Rock.
[57:37.42]Get the rock.
[57:38.68]Where?
[57:38.98]This?
[57:39.32]This one right here?
[57:42.33]Which one?
[57:44.33]No, where is it?
[57:45.43]Which rock are you talking about?
[57:47.21]On the right side?
[57:48.80]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:54.64]The mega bomb is going to hurt me.
[57:55.52]Alright, second item room.
[58:03.06]Give me something big.
[58:08.09]The fuck?
[58:10.25]Ten bombs and I'm just Mr. Bomb Guy.
[58:19.41]Well, let's... Don't move.
[58:25.41]What the fuck?
[58:26.17]I'm trying to just... Alright, let's... I just have a... A pile?
[58:35.74]What the fuck is this thing?
[58:42.14]Ah, I'm trying to bait him.
[58:45.16]Oh my god, this is going to be hard to do this.
[58:47.72]The bombs.
[58:50.90]Oh my fuck.
[58:57.31]Just keep moving.
[58:57.99]Oh my... Holy shit.
[59:01.19]Okay, we can try it again.
[59:11.98]Is there a way that he... is he telegraphed?
[59:14.24]I haven't even been looking.
[59:15.32]Not really.
[59:15.78]Kind of just... Jesus!
[59:26.29]Whoa!
[59:30.89]What the fuck?!
[59:33.82]He does that shit?!
[59:36.80]How did I not die?! !
[59:43.68]he's gonna do that oh oh my god this guy sucks alright no more bombs just try to dodge I guess what the is that
[60:13.58]How many more moves does this guy have?
[60:18.52]Oh!
[60:30.31]Ah!
[60:33.53]What the?
[60:35.14]Alright.
[60:38.76]First time ever fighting boss.
[60:40.32]Let's see if I can learn how to fight him.
[60:45.93]Oh my goodness.
[60:46.67]This is so bad.
[60:47.81]This guy sucks.
[60:51.60]This ends the run.
[60:58.16]Okay.
[60:59.39]Omega lul easy.
[61:00.55]This guy's not easy.
[61:02.79]What crack are you smoking?
[61:05.85]I'm going right now.
[61:23.10]Alright, I think I got that part done.
[61:28.76]Jesus Christ.
[61:35.73]Ugh!
[61:46.23]Oh, what the fuck?
[61:50.17]This motherfucker can just telefrag you.
[62:06.57]Is he, like, pointing a direction?
[62:07.89]Oh, fuck!
[62:19.16]Where does...
[62:35.34]I don't understand how you avoid that.
[62:36.80]Is it random?
[62:41.22]Maybe I should just keep running in a circle.
[62:43.11]I'm just going to run in a circle.
[62:47.31]Oh, that didn't work.
[62:47.91]I'm just going to literally never stop moving.
[62:58.51]Is it knowing I'm doing that?
[62:59.91]It knows I'm doing that.
[63:00.67]He's trying to catch me.
[63:01.57]He's like, I know what you're doing.
[63:02.37]I'm going to trip you.
[63:03.65]I'm going to trip you, you motherfucker.
[63:23.99]Oh, I'm dead.
[63:29.53]Well, I'm gonna go to the shop for the last ditch effort here.
[63:32.28]I have to go to the shop.
[63:35.64]This guy killed me like nine times.
[63:41.57]Oh my god, this guy sucks.
[63:52.03]Imagine if he died right there.
[63:53.64]That would be so bad.
[63:58.80]You have one heart.
[64:03.20]This build isn't that good anyways.
[64:04.79]Just keep giving... Oh, this is all 50% off.
[64:08.85]Good thing it's more options in the store.
[64:11.71]A super key.
[64:14.99]And a pill.
[64:17.00]Oh, that's full health though.
[64:21.36]Uh, give me this.
[64:22.70]Whatever.
[64:23.02]I'm dead.
[64:25.46]This is... I can take... I can... No!
[64:31.42]No, I'm gonna get hit.
[64:32.97]I need more hearts.
[64:34.03]It was a mistake to take the fucking guppy's tail.
[64:36.51]I shouldn't have even touched it.
[64:40.33]Go to the library.
[64:43.53]Holy shit, there is a library.
[64:45.33]What?
[64:47.43]Is it two keys to get in there?
[65:10.18]Don't do that to me right now.
[65:11.33]Come on.
[65:12.83]Larry's... Larry's Jr.
[65:14.39]Here we go.
[65:29.49]Well, uh, okay.
[65:31.97]This may have saved the run.
[65:34.11]If I can just play well.
[65:35.47]Alright, what do we got?
[65:38.78]We got, uh, soul protection.
[65:40.88]Just get the free heart.
[65:43.98]Uh, now we... This is just, uh, evil.
[65:47.68]Do not use it.
[65:48.34]Get the free heart.
[65:50.05]Okay.
[65:51.17]Uh, and then psychic shot.
[65:53.69]I just got two soul hearts for this one.
[66:01.02]So this one, Psychic Shot, should I do maybe... Should I keep this one?
[66:10.53]This doesn't add any damage, though.
[66:12.81]Keep the Satanic one.
[66:13.93]Alright, well, I'm gonna get hit by... I'm gonna get rocked back and forth like five times.
[66:19.41]Guys, don't you understand?
[66:20.17]I'm gonna get hit by a spike broom accidentally on the way back up to the boss.
[66:25.63]By the battery.
[66:26.23]Didn't I already do it?
[66:27.67]I already bought the battery.
[66:34.38]The extra half part.
[66:36.76]I told you it was going to fucking happen.
[66:38.60]I knew it.
[66:39.36]I'm like looking at chat and I knew I was going to walk into a spike.
[66:43.48]I told you it was going to happen.
[66:49.79]Whatever.
[66:52.53]Blow up the skulls.
[66:53.39]Oh.
[66:57.49]Oh.
[67:01.37]Yeah.
[67:01.83]Okay.
[67:02.45]Now we do this one too.
[67:05.60]Run, save.
[67:06.40]Run, save.
[67:07.02]What is it?
[67:08.99]Okay.
[67:13.33]This is possible now.
[67:14.87]Just don't fuck it up.
[67:17.83]Don't mess it up.
[67:23.26]I just have to be careful.
[67:24.66]Oh, I forgot.
[67:28.27]Imagine if I explored before.
[67:29.75]Yeah, I know, but I was so upset that I couldn't kill this guy.
[67:34.78]His fucking teleport move.
[67:37.82]It's just, it's just stupid.
[67:39.08]You know what I mean?
[67:39.56]Like, I don't understand why that's even in the game.
[67:41.30]I don't know why that's in the game.
[67:43.92]It's just, it's stupid.
[67:44.74]Like, why is it even in the game?
[67:46.74]Right?
[67:47.16]Just like, just quote that.
[67:49.10]Hey, hold on.
[67:50.04]I got an idea.
[67:50.54]I'll do it for you.
[67:53.55]It's just stupid.
[67:54.15]It shouldn't even be in the fucking game.
[67:58.22]Right?
[68:00.99]That's good, right?
[68:05.49]Can you hear it?
[68:06.79]I don't know.
[68:07.13]You can't hear it.
[68:08.81]Right.
[68:09.11]Sometimes the GoXLR just doesn't work.
[68:10.53]I don't know why.
[68:15.22]I just tried to record it on the GoXLR so I could play it like five times, but this armature just doesn't work.
[68:22.68]And sometimes it makes me sound like a fucking robot randomly for no reason.
[68:28.22]Okay, well, whatever.
[68:30.26]Bring back the wink command.
[68:34.81]Wait, what happened?
[68:36.15]Wait, what?
[68:37.53]Why is this a different person?
[68:40.77]What's going on?
[68:42.17]Why is it war?
[68:47.18]Wait, why do I have a new boss?
[68:53.29]Wait, did the game feel bad for me?
[68:54.75]Because I used Book of Revelations.
[68:56.85]Oh, that's right.
[68:58.63]Oh, shit.
[69:01.68]Hope we don't see that bone guy again.
[69:15.75]No damage, no damage, no damage, no damage.
[69:26.71]okay so do I that's that's I could get bandage that's a band-aid girl right or tears up get the screw tears and shot speed up yeah ah okay okay let's go
[69:57.81]What's the blue mom?
[70:30.03]Watch out for greed!
[70:38.05]Nice!
[70:38.33]Okay, so I haven't unlocked the negative yet, so... Oh, runs actually saved.
[70:49.97]What does he need to... I need to do... ...an hour.
[71:00.84]So, I don't have the negative right now.
[71:02.32]Yeah, this is a rebirth save file.
[71:04.60]There's an old save file to make sure I didn't play the game like a thousand times.
[71:08.12]Go to Satan, then?
[71:08.78]Should I just... What's the protocol here to go to... Actually, just to go to Satan?
[71:13.69]Just go in?
[71:18.75]Don't pick up... Don't take the Polaroid to go to Satan, right?
[71:21.51]Because it isn't Polaroid to take you to heaven.
[71:27.66]Take it.
[71:27.92]Take the Polaroid.
[71:30.96]What?
[71:31.20]Take it?
[71:31.68]Doesn't the Polaroid mean you go to a... Alright, let's go.
[71:36.83]You can still choose to go down.
[71:38.01]Oh, okay.
[71:38.61]Yeah, that's right.
[71:41.53]Alright, well, here's where we actually lose the game.
[71:44.13]Look at my damage.
[71:44.93]I still have only 420 divided by 10 damage.
[71:46.09]That's not good.
[71:54.60]This guy should... Okay, if you're not killing enemies down here in the womb in less than three seconds, it's over.
[72:08.38]This guy doesn't die in three seconds.
[72:10.18]The run's over.
[72:10.70]How am I supposed to beat Mecha Satan?
[72:15.73]How am I supposed to beat Mecha Satan like this?
[72:29.50]Alright, almost time for another heart.
[72:37.65]Man.
[72:37.89]I'm getting kind of lucky with these hearts.
[72:42.51]Why is there a grainy filter on the game?
[72:46.00]Because it's supposed to be scary and weird.
[72:48.02]That didn't give me a full heart?
[73:08.64]I've never played this game.
[73:09.44]Why do you sneeze on people?
[73:12.66]Oh.
[73:15.43]This is good.
[73:16.07]Alright, I'm going to take it right now.
[73:18.57]Just don't take five hits.
[73:21.73]Easy.
[73:21.93]It's not easy anymore.
[73:38.48]God, die!
[73:45.94]Dance, dance, dance, dance.
[73:49.53]Bad aim.
[74:02.85]Fire!
[74:07.91]Pots.
[74:08.79]Keys.
[74:11.57]I can't get over there.
[74:12.25]Never seen these guys before.
[74:17.96]Get rid of the Hershey's Kisses and then deal with the rest.
[74:34.64]Imagine taking damage from one of these little poop things.
[74:37.02]Holy shit.
[74:37.92]I should have just ended my career.
[74:41.84]Oh, they just die.
[74:42.83]No, do they?
[74:44.03]Okay, they just explode.
[74:46.65]Alright, let's go.
[74:50.63]Yeah.
[74:50.87]I don't have any bombs.
[75:00.28]I just realized this.
[75:01.62]Half my items are bombs.
[75:04.18]Yeah, I don't have any.
[75:06.60]It's a bomb damage.
[75:10.20]Great.
[75:22.13]Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.
[75:28.53]Uh-oh.
[75:34.96]Get him with the poison.
[75:35.56]Forget about him.
[75:37.38]They're not even scary.
[75:41.13]Toy boat.
[75:42.07]Toy boat.
[75:42.61]Toy boat.
[75:43.21]Toy boat.
[75:44.73]Hmm.
[75:45.41]Alright, left or right?
[75:47.03]Left or right?
[75:47.73]Left or right?
[75:48.41]Left or right?
[75:49.09]Which one?
[75:49.77]Which one?
[75:50.49]Which one?
[75:52.16]Just... I'm gonna... Right?
[75:54.08]Left?
[75:54.64]Left?
[75:55.08]Right?
[75:56.84]Right?
[75:57.46]Left?
[75:59.90]Left is always right.
[76:07.38]Well, it's alright.
[76:18.29]Stay in the sides.
[76:19.17]This guy's not even a problem.
[76:20.37]Alright, we're gonna get the coal.
[76:32.00]Give me, like, the rock.
[76:33.86]Give me... No.
[76:34.96]What is it?
[76:37.29]A lump of coal.
[76:37.99]Alright, we need range.
[76:42.19]Lump of coal.
[76:43.37]You get more damage the further the balls travel, right?
[76:45.67]Alright, now give me the thing that gives me really slow shot speed.
[76:51.71]Tons of range and bring my shot speed down a ton.
[76:55.39]So this just be turned into gigantic snowballs.
[77:01.64]Alright, let's use this too.
[77:02.54]Might as well.
[77:03.00]Free heart.
[77:07.67]That's not how it worked.
[77:09.40]So I've been wrong for three and a half years, I think.
[77:11.84]Four years.
[77:12.20]So what does that actually do?
[77:15.42]I've been wrong for probably five plus years.
[77:19.40]What does that do?
[77:24.33]It's just distance, not travel time.
[77:27.45]Casino!
[77:31.63]I only put five dollars into the casino.
[77:37.93]What is this?
[77:38.39]What the hell does this thing do?
[77:42.03]It's a battery machine?
[77:47.82]Wait.
[77:58.68]Okay, what's the... What if I just keep getting coins and keep getting, uh, black hearts?
[78:05.61]Holy shit!
[78:06.25]Alright, hold on.
[78:07.01]This is my idea.
[78:07.93]Alright, come on.
[78:16.74]I can overcharge it.
[78:24.77]No, give me more than one coin!
[78:26.17]Bullshit!
[78:38.67]Thank you.
[78:39.09]Well, I made out.
[78:41.74]Let's play this.
[78:46.70]Don't worry.
[78:47.28]I'll blow this guy up in just a minute.
[78:50.40]You got a refund.
[78:58.26]Ahhhh Lemon party.
[79:03.47]Alright, let's go.
[79:05.43]I still have no damage up.
[79:07.19]This is gonna- this is gonna fail catastrophically at some point.
[79:23.46]I need like- ahhh
[79:26.57]I need more tears or more damage or anything.
[79:37.19]This is easy.
[79:37.71]I won't say that out loud though, because if you say that out loud, you're going to take like three hits.
[79:46.91]What difficulty are you playing on?
[79:47.99]This is on normal.
[79:49.13]I'm just casually playing them.
[79:51.70]Well, I've only played this game for like a few hours, so I'm just trying to, this is on normal.
[80:02.76]Still learning the game.
[80:05.08]Pepe laugh.
[80:18.55]Don't step on the spikes.
[80:19.51]What are those things?
[80:20.69]Collectibles?
[80:21.77]Oh, I'll never get over how bad that was.
[80:24.45]You couldn't think of, like, marshmallows.
[80:26.37]That would be, I don't know, what would be worse?
[80:29.15]Go in here?
[80:30.73]What does this do?
[80:31.15]I don't know what that is.
[80:37.69]What does the two room do?
[80:38.73]Alright.
[80:40.23]Room two.
[80:42.38]The room of two.
[80:43.28]That's not how my cheat sheet... There it is.
[80:47.22]Okay.
[80:48.00]Rerolls all pickups in the room.
[80:55.84]Okay.
[80:56.12]This rerolls the pickups in the room.
[80:57.89]So it'll reroll the four coins.
[80:59.73]So just whatever.
[81:00.39]What are we going to get?
[81:04.05]Oh, that's actually pretty good.
[81:07.30]Wait, can I do it again?
[81:08.00]How many times can I... Holy shit, that's a jackpot!
[81:19.12]Tears down, of course.
[81:20.34]Tears down, tears down.

[87:05.27]Where am I getting all this money?
[87:12.92]Where was this 20 minutes ago?
[87:19.86]These guys just kill them?
[87:21.92]They don't do anything weird?
[87:28.39]Hey, what's going on, guys?
[87:29.47]Jerma here with a Binding of Isaac Let's Play.
[87:33.68]And what I mean by Let's Play and what I say by this is, remember back in 2012 when somebody would make a Let's Play of a game and it would be 12 minutes and you'd make a new video every 12 fucking minutes?
[87:46.93]That's why I never played these games and never did Let's Plays.
[87:49.89]Can you imagine if I only streamed for 12 minutes a day?
[87:53.61]Anyways, I'm playing with, uh, this is Kane.
[88:00.86]And I'll see you guys in 12 or 15 separate YouTube videos to see if I get to Mom.
[88:10.93]See you next time!
[88:20.33]Are these guys melee?
[88:22.38]I think so.
[88:25.26]Where's the dubstep music?
[88:28.16]Watch out for their melee.
[88:31.29]This guy has clothes on.
[88:32.34]He must be... I think that's the leader.
[88:45.56]By the way, for those of you watching, Satan is the easiest boss in the whole game.
[88:49.61]Until his phase three, he becomes the second easiest boss in the game.
[88:54.69]But for some reason, I have so much trouble with the third phase because my brain is made out of eggs.
[89:04.78]This actually, this guy actually sucks.
[89:06.84]Actually the worst boss in the game.
[89:08.20]I hate this guy.
[89:09.54]I hate this guy.
[89:10.12]I hate it.
[89:13.76]No, actually not this one.
[89:14.54]The other one.
[89:15.28]The green one.
[89:15.86]What's the green one?
[89:16.52]There's a green version of this guy that's way worse than this.
[89:20.72]Okay.
[89:21.06]Forgot he did that.
[89:21.94]Oh my god.
[89:30.17]Forgot his moot.
[89:32.59]The bloat sucks.
[89:34.57]Yeah, he sucks.
[89:38.49]Irma sucks.
[89:40.81]Oh, don't worry.
[89:41.45]Everything's gonna be fine.
[89:52.50]Okay, things are starting to get a little, a little more, uh, scary, but it's okay.
[90:03.39]I tried to fucking move.
[90:05.17]Oh boy, this is bad.
[90:06.41]Alright, stop.
[90:24.31]Super Nintendo Kid, right?
[90:25.35]Nintendo Kid.
[90:27.73]What's this called?
[90:34.27]Oh my god.
[90:37.29]I don't know the patterns.
[90:38.18]This is the first time I've seen these motherfuckers.
[90:40.20]Emperor.
[90:40.82]Let's go.
[90:41.22]Let's go.
[90:41.70]I gotta go now.
[90:42.46]Let's go.
[90:44.22]No.
[90:44.50]Just let's go.
[90:45.36]Let's go.
[90:47.80]Tears down.
[90:48.36]No.
[90:48.68]I'm going.
[90:49.02]3, 2, 1.
[90:49.82]Take...
[90:59.02]Oh, what the fuck?
[91:02.10]What was the intro?
[91:16.62]Oh, here we go.
[91:23.18]Oh my God, I'm fucking panicking for no reason.
[91:31.86]Oh my god, I'm fucking panicking.
[91:33.15]I'm hitting every single wrong button.
[91:51.81]Oh my god, fucking here comes the choke.
[91:53.45]I just choked so fucking hard.
[91:56.26]Oh my god, damn it.
[91:57.82]It's been a while.
[91:59.04]I haven't played it in a while.
[92:00.46]Fuck!
[92:00.94]Alright, it's good.
[92:01.48]It's okay.
[92:05.60]Why do they get a shield?
[92:10.35]What?
[92:10.85]Alright, I can focus.
[92:11.69]Come on.
[92:12.67]It's not that fucking hard.
[92:17.59]Polaroid?
[92:18.87]What?
[92:29.43]Fuck me.
[92:30.67]Where was the sip?
[92:31.39]What?
[92:33.01]Alright.
[92:33.29]I'm fucking... Okay.
[92:34.35]Alright.
[92:35.05]It's a warm-up round.
[92:36.36]It was a warm-up round.
[92:44.92]Plus, this build sucks ass.
[92:51.07]This build's terrible.
[92:55.23]That spell sucked.
[92:56.23]It was like, it's eight bomb items.
[92:58.41]It was like seven bomb items.
[93:00.17]It's alright.
[93:03.16]It's all bad.
[93:03.58]I'm able to go.
[93:04.16]It looks to go.
[93:06.10]Sometimes you gotta fucking just get a warm-up rounded.
[93:18.08]He's so easy, too.
[93:19.72]I just, like, haven't played in too long.
[93:22.03]It's alright.
[93:22.55]You take one warm-up round.
[93:23.91]Yeah, you can't beat fucking Satan on your first try coming back after, like, nine months.
[93:27.77]Alright?
[93:28.19]Like, a baby could have been born in the time that I've played this game last.
[93:31.15]We're fine.
[93:31.65]Everything's fine.
[93:35.37]And now we... Oh, that's not quad shot.
[93:37.63]Game sucks.
[93:50.32]It's just that, like, oh, I've got here.
[93:52.08]It's been a while.
[93:52.78]I lose.
[93:53.46]I get hit 12 times.
[93:55.51]I'm so angry right now.
[93:57.85]But I can't, like, if you get three grand slams at the bottom of the ninth inning, you're still a pitcher, right?
[94:02.21]You're still a pitcher of the game.
[94:06.59]What, am I going to, like, start rolling on my back and be like, yeah!
[94:10.22]Yeah!
[94:11.50]Like, smashing my hands on the ground.
[94:17.15]No, I let off a grand slam.
[94:18.85]You gotta keep pitching.
[94:30.41]Nah, I feel warmed up.
[94:31.58]I feel warmed up.
[94:32.26]I feel good.
[94:32.90]I feel just terrible.
[94:34.08]And remember when I told you, it was like, we were in like the third floor, and I was like, nah, this build sucks.
[94:38.70]I don't like this.
[94:41.00]This build sucks.
[94:43.28]Where?
[94:44.53]I'm gonna roll on the back of the Pinterest Mount and put my hands on the ground and go, man, smash.
[94:48.55]Okay, stop.
[94:52.52]Good.
[94:53.36]Look at that.
[94:54.42]First item right off the bat.
[94:55.52]That's what we're looking for.
[94:56.46]Alright, now be calm, be collected.
[94:59.08]Explore.
[95:05.80]Goddamn died to Satan.
[95:09.01]That's not even like... Stupid-ass bullshit.
[95:22.07]Alright, good.
[95:22.59]I got another key.
[95:24.66]I missed a rock, apparently.
[95:25.70]I'll get it.
[95:26.04]This infestation is pretty good.
[95:32.84]It helps.
[95:34.46]Ooh, whip worm!
[95:35.72]I know what this does.
[95:36.34]Shot speed.
[95:43.82]Why is chat mean tonight?
[95:46.35]May I welcome you to Jerma985's Twitch channel.
[95:50.99]Must be new here.
[95:51.61]I think he must be new.
[96:05.25]He hates us.
[96:07.95]No, stop.
[96:09.09]I can't look at chat anymore.
[96:10.25]You're going to kill me.
[96:11.43]Don't look at chat.
[96:12.80]Play.
[96:14.44]Come on.
[96:15.10]Don't be an idiot.
[96:15.76]This is a good start.
[96:20.26]Okay.
[96:20.64]Where's that Brock?
[96:21.74]Oh, god damn it.
[96:26.99]Okay.
[96:28.25]I missed a tinted Brock.
[96:32.13]Right here.
[96:33.03]Why is it lagging every time I go in a new room?
[96:37.95]Is it happening on your screen?
[96:39.13]Why is it happening?
[96:39.67]You got a shitty PC.
[96:47.93]I don't have a shitty PC.
[96:49.13]How dare you?
[96:49.81]Okay, let's go.
[96:57.74]Did you get the real Hulk game?
[96:59.34]Why is it lagging?
[97:06.64]Is this running on, like, OpenGL right now?
[97:12.49]Well, fuck.
[97:18.15]I don't want this!
[97:19.07]I don't want this again!
[97:20.33]Secret room.
[97:22.58]Damn it.
[97:29.76]OpenGL is really smooth.
[97:34.65]Why is this lagging?
[97:35.77]Have you seen that too?
[97:36.61]I don't understand why this is happening.
[97:48.47]Like, when I open a new door, it's just like...
[98:01.54]Holy shit, he almost got me.
[98:02.65]It's a good shot.
[98:06.85]Close Platinum God.
[98:09.71]Wait, that could be accurate.
[98:18.78]That actually might be accurate.
[98:22.13]I think it was.
[98:22.59]Let's see.
[98:25.18]Don't you wish I had a... Sorry.
[98:29.74]Sorry, I got... It's like a hair in my mouth.
[98:41.15]I'm gonna lie about Hulk.
[98:43.51]No, I'm gonna play the GameCube Hulk very, very soon.
[98:55.48]Thank god, but this infestation is fucking perfect.
[99:07.75]Oh, man.
[99:09.07]How could I let that happen?
[99:12.45]I just let that happen.
[99:13.80]That's unbelievable.
[99:19.88]Tonight?
[99:20.66]No, not tonight.
[99:21.96]Some other day.
[99:22.72]I'll miss that rock.
[99:25.24]I have a bomb.
[99:28.08]Oh, wait.
[99:28.44]What's that?
[99:28.94]What does this do?
[99:32.93]Your rage grows.
[99:34.03]Is this the Samson thing?
[99:41.57]This is every time I take a hit, I get higher damage, right?
[99:47.56]It's probably better.
[99:49.56]Not every time.
[99:51.82]It's good for bad players.
[99:57.26]No, it's not every time.
[99:58.98]No, keep the worm.
[100:00.80]That's not good then.
[100:03.44]What am I supposed to do about that?
[100:06.42]Come on.
[100:06.68]RNG.
[100:06.78]RNG.
[100:19.79]I should have an emote that's like RNG or something.
[100:25.34]Oh, let's just kill this.
[100:26.04]No.
[100:27.12]Go to the item room.
[100:27.94]I need a... I need a key.
[100:36.00]Why did I use my only key on the chest?
[100:38.30]Because I always think the chest is going to have like three keys in it.
[100:42.74]I always completely overthink what could be in that.
[100:45.04]Come on.
[100:45.76]No, give me a key.
[100:48.20]Quick, jingle keys.
[100:51.87]Don't need money.
[100:54.27]Last chance is right here.
[100:55.15]Can't even go in the fucking item room.
[101:19.29]There's one more chance here.
[101:23.04]Uh... Key... There's no keys in here.
[101:26.40]Alright, that's Guppy's tail.
[101:36.31]Secret room is either... It could be anywhere.
[101:43.17]It could be up here.
[101:45.27]It could be in that little spot in the middle.
[101:47.29]It could be down left.
[101:49.49]No bombs.
[101:49.99]I have the explosive head.
[101:53.43]Right here.
[101:53.77]No, I already tried this one.
[102:00.89]Or down here.
[102:02.74]Right here.
[102:06.12]Could be right there.
[102:06.72]I'm going to try it.
[102:10.80]there we go thanks for the key imagine being on the second floor and not being able to go in the item room fuck that's so bad no alright let's go it's my fault I know and I'm taking I'm gonna take the blame for it but it still hurts
[102:46.45]Oh, this is the guy that pulls his mouth back, right?
[102:49.55]And he goes... I'm waiting for him to do it.
[103:03.64]What?! !
[103:15.67]If you get up close and you try to cheese it, he rips to the left.
[103:18.75]Alright, this is a pretty good start.
[103:21.27]This is toothpicks.
[103:22.11]Tears up, shots speed up.
[103:25.13]This is what we needed in the very beginning.
[103:27.15]Let's go in here.
[103:29.35]I don't know what that is.
[103:30.51]But it looks new and cool, but I can't get it.
[103:32.53]I can't afford it.
[103:35.53]What does that do?
[103:36.69]I need to see.
[103:37.13]I just want to know what it does.
[103:41.97]What does this look like?
[103:44.52]Oh, what's it called?
[103:45.32]Oculus Rift?
[103:47.18]Fired tiers now have a chance to summon a rift when they land on the ground.
[103:50.85]The spawned rift sucks in enemies, projectiles, and pickups, and deals damage to enemies caught inside.
[103:55.55]That sounds so much fun, but I can't touch it.
[104:05.09]It sucks.
[104:05.81]It's not good.
[104:06.47]Items suck.
[104:06.97]It sucks.
[104:07.31]It sucks.
[104:08.47]Oh, does it?
[104:12.06]Oh, okay.
[104:12.54]Well, it just, it sucks.
[104:15.76]What's the left one?
[104:16.42]That's the contract, right?
[104:20.65]Contract from below doubles your pickup drops, including chests, soul hearts, and other consumables which spawn at the end of a room.
[104:27.31]But I'll only have one heart.
[104:37.24]But I'll get soul hearts.
[104:41.68]I know I'm an idiot.
[104:42.48]Whatever.
[104:46.28]Run over.
[104:47.54]As long as I can not get hit.
[104:49.40]Well, this is XL.
[104:50.12]We got two item rooms here.
[104:51.19]I need keys.
[104:51.87]I got a lot of health, man.
[105:03.57]How much health do you have?
[105:15.61]Let me get the last hits on these guys.
[105:17.37]Stop.
[105:17.93]Stop.
[105:18.33]Ooh.
[105:21.28]Nice.
[105:21.68]Okay.
[105:22.62]Worth it so far.
[105:24.56]No key, though.
[105:25.40]Ow.
[105:26.04]That was impossible.
[105:39.94]Now I'm afraid to do anything.
[105:42.07]Because I have one heart.
[105:44.95]When I play, I need, this is why I used to play with Magdalene.
[105:49.51]There we go.
[105:50.27]Thank you.
[105:50.65]It's because she has four fucking hearts.
[106:00.94]That's a noob character.
[106:02.40]Yeah, that's, whatever, that's fine.
[106:03.66]This is really great, though.
[106:05.09]Look at all this money.
[106:06.69]Alright, I need the item room.
[106:14.33]Watch it.
[106:15.09]Excuse me.
[106:23.05]Okay.
[106:23.89]Itemed.
[106:37.54]Good.
[106:39.80]See, those gold chests, you either get screwed or you don't.
[106:54.06]Keep generating bugs.
[106:57.34]Yeah, those are the two options.
[106:58.66]Yeah, I know.
[107:09.33]A little hunt.
[107:13.52]This kind of follows me around.
[107:14.58]What does he do?
[107:18.80]A little friend?
[107:21.47]I usually don't like getting the familiars because I feel like they just kind of randomly will do interesting... The rock?
[107:28.35]Huh?
[107:30.41]Or is there a rock?
[107:34.81]The familiars just kind of randomly will do something good randomly.

[107:40.18]Oh, right here?
[107:40.60]Alright.

[108:04.51]I need health.
[108:05.53]And I need another item.
[108:14.54]Step on the spikes.
[108:16.12]Not me, you.
[108:17.06]Not me!
[108:17.84]Stop saying me.
[108:27.03]Okay.

[110:00.89]At least you got your $5 fart.
[110:16.37]That little guy is kind of good.
[110:18.68]He just turns away an enemy.
[110:19.66]That's kind of good.
[110:20.28]It's not bad.
[110:22.42]It works out pretty well.
[110:30.10]What's replacing wink?
[110:34.86]Sink.
[110:35.66]There's a can that's going to be connected to my sink.
[110:37.80]And I turn the camera on and turn the water on.
[110:43.06]Why would I do that?
[110:43.60]That would be horrible.

[115:25.24]Whatever.
[115:25.66]It's still possible.

[115:50.15]If you don't know what Bob's brain does, that.
[115:52.37]I have no control over it.
[115:54.53]It could just blow up in front of me, and it's not good.
[116:00.39]Use the card, use the card, use the card.
[116:02.41]It just takes me to the item room.
[116:05.27]Well, there's Dad's key.
[116:09.15]Opens all doors.
[116:12.85]Now, does this open all doors on the whole floor?
[116:15.17]Or only in the room you're in?
[116:21.43]Is it the whole floor?
[116:22.03]Or just the room?
[116:23.49]Just the room you're in.
[116:24.23]Okay.
[116:25.35]Although... I want to get another card from here.
[116:34.77]Speed down.
[116:39.62]Keep Dad's Keep and Mega Satan.
[116:41.40]I don't think I have that unlocked yet.
[116:45.32]God damn it!
[116:46.16]I knew it was going to fucking happen.
[116:47.36]There was nothing I could do.
[116:48.22]I had to do it.
[116:56.69]I've got a secret, though.
[116:57.71]This is gonna kill me.
[116:59.13]And this is a... Why did I pick up Bob's brain?
[117:01.65]You have to be so hyper aware of every shot when it's active.
[117:07.45]Okay.
[117:18.44]Don't open that.
[117:18.94]I can open it for free.
[117:29.33]Poison, too.
[117:29.89]That's actually kind of bad.
[117:31.13]It's the stars again.
[117:33.95]Alright, we'll just take the two hearts.
[117:37.19]What am I going to use it for?
[117:38.17]I have the stars now.
[117:39.29]Let's go get Dad's key.
[117:51.10]Let's go open the door.
[117:52.20]Take Dad's car.
[118:05.93]Not very good selection, but whatever.
[118:07.72]No, I'm keeping the money.
[118:11.58]I should quick jingle the keys.
[118:22.81]Wait, what is that?
[118:26.21]How do I get that?
[118:31.85]I have an idea.
[118:40.45]I can get it if I go really quick.
[118:42.04]Ready?
[118:50.90]Bob's brain's gonna kill me!
[118:52.06]Fucking Bob's brain!
[118:56.06]I can't do it!
[118:57.08]I can't fire!
[118:57.82]Okay.

[119:21.84]What the fuck?
[119:25.76]Jesus.
[119:26.18]Dude, that faceman, you don't know what the fucking enemy does.

[120:47.94]Come on.
[120:48.70]I just got there with a ship built, by the way.
[120:51.44]Can you hear him almost crying?
[120:52.48]What is this?
[120:58.37]Book of Despair.
[120:59.19]Temporary Tears Up?
[121:01.99]I need my cheat sheet for this.
[121:08.09]Book of Despair.
[121:13.00]This is Antibirth.
[121:14.44]Upon use, gives you a large tears up for the rest of the room.
[121:19.28]Oh, that's actually pretty good.
[121:23.34]So that's it.
[121:24.91]This is really good.
[121:29.83]Alright, don't fuck it up.
[121:30.73]Don't pick up Bob's brain.
[121:47.31]Come here, you little shit.
[121:48.55]Alright.
[121:53.57]Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fu- I'm fine.
[121:56.97]I mean, that sucks when you get in a scenario like this.
[122:02.65]Oh, come on, no.
[122:07.11]There's a spider web right here.
[122:08.75]Okay.
[122:09.81]Okay, Jeremy, you don't have to die from the fire.
[122:22.13]You can't push these?
[122:22.73]Just run across?
[122:29.02]I know, but I wanted the coins that could have been in them.
[122:30.80]I'm a greedy fuck.
[122:31.80]Alright, let's kill this guy.
[122:35.21]Gerglings.
[122:39.07]That's a shitload of tears up.
[122:52.72]Will one of you die?
[123:03.25]Almost baited me into that one.
[123:06.59]Oh, man.
[123:07.25]This is HP up, tears up, and shot speed down.
[123:11.69]This is the thing I was talking about.
[123:14.47]Technically, I'm already at what?
[123:16.01]Cap?
[123:20.73]Oh, let's see.
[123:23.36]So, set and then I know.
[123:24.30]What will happen is this will bring me down to four.
[123:26.74]Okay.
[123:29.48]I get it.
[123:29.80]Alright, well let's do the other room.
[123:36.76]Down, down, right.
[123:38.51]I need a bomb or a key or something.
[123:45.33]I need just a rock.
[123:46.31]Well, I can't blow it up until I get a bomb.
[123:48.21]That's what I'm trying to do.
[123:48.93]I'm trying to get a bomb.
[123:49.57]I'm trying to open the doors.
[123:50.87]Got a key.
[123:52.88]Cool.
[123:53.22]I need like another coffee or something.
[123:55.14]Anybody else like get tired?
[123:56.14]I want like a coffee or something.
[123:59.56]I'm going to have to get some of my cold brew downstairs.
[124:15.11]Damn it.
[124:16.21]That's the crutch item, but I kind of want it.
[124:19.15]I'm just going to use it once.
[124:23.67]This thing's so much better.
[124:26.11]It's so much better.
[124:28.51]I know I need it, but this is much better.
[124:30.17]This is so much more damage.
[124:31.05]No.
[124:31.71]I got three hearts.
[124:32.37]I'm fine.
[124:40.81]Cat puke.
[124:42.37]That was a cat puke.
[124:44.69]Use key on door.
[124:46.01]Use key on door.
[124:47.85]No.
[124:51.21]We missed a bomb.
[124:55.87]curse room no I need the health should I do the curse room what do you think I never go in the curse room and this is why I don't go in the curse room all I did here was just delete a full heart for no reason because I just don't it's too much it's too it's too unlucky as I already take every pill every single time you want me to go in every curse room this is bad news I think I got that one coin
[125:35.06]It's worth it.
[125:39.33]One dogecoin.
[125:44.01]That's not even funny, but it is.
[125:47.97]Why is that funny?
[125:50.81]It is.
[125:51.15]Alright, let's go to the casino.
[125:57.64]Oh.
[126:01.31]I mean, if I had like a million dollars right now, I would just keep halving my tier delay until it was like 0.2.
[126:05.75]He's malding.
[126:06.43]Where'd he get that idea?
[126:31.39]There's a hard cap of five tiers?
[126:33.49]Well, although technically true, you can go under the cap if you have things that half your tier delay.
[126:40.18]Even if you have a tier delay item, it'll work.
[126:47.59]That is actually true.
[126:49.61]She just called me a nerd for knowing that.
[126:51.03]Alright.
[127:05.68]How are you going to respond to that one?
[127:07.62]What should I say?
[127:10.02]No, I'm not.
[127:15.84]Bone curse room.
[127:16.76]If I have extra health to work with, I will.
[127:19.51]I don't... I'm not going to do this either.
[127:21.41]If I had like four or five full hearts, I'd probably do this.
[127:26.27]And you need like a... I'm not doing it.
[127:28.89]Use door on key.
[127:29.73]What the hell are you talking about?
[127:37.35]Get rid of the barters.
[127:47.51]Everyone's got a wedgie?
[127:52.47]I actually kind of do.
[127:57.44]I do, actually.
[128:00.94]It's been bothering me for like the last 15 straight minutes.
[128:08.14]So, the person's not wrong.
[128:14.88]What's this?
[128:16.08]Brain Worm?
[128:17.30]Ding?
[128:22.07]Brain Worm?
[128:23.19]Let's look it up.
[128:28.69]Brain Worm.
[128:31.76]Missed tiers will redirect themselves and travel sideways towards enemies.
[128:46.31]Holy shit, this is unbelievably good.
[128:55.95]That's very, very good.
[128:57.59]The amount of times that you miss by one or two pixels in this game is... That corrects it completely.
[129:05.04]This is awesome.
[129:08.22]Well, maybe not quite, but kind of.
[129:09.90]Wow, this is great.
[129:10.94]Okay, now all I need is a shitload of tears up, and like, plus 10 damage, and 10 more hearts, and I'll beat the game.
[129:30.11]Seeing the beam is like I'm about to hold R. It's just such a waste of an item.
[129:37.97]People are going to do sad face.
[129:39.93]Bean, he doesn't like the bean.
[129:41.51]No, nobody does.
[129:43.03]Nobody thinks that item is any good.
[129:50.88]Gemini.
[129:51.48]Look at that tear corrector.
[130:01.46]Working flawlessly.
[130:08.04]The strategy with this guy is don't spam.
[130:11.24]Like I know what the fuck I'm even talking about.
[130:12.76]Don't listen to a word I say.
[130:13.72]This is a fun game, though.
[130:25.81]Ooh.
[130:29.41]This is another Tears Up item.
[130:31.35]Tears Up and Shot Speed Up.
[130:33.55]So this item... Does this book become useless?
[130:35.11]Yes.
[130:43.08]Pretty good for a devil room, I'll be honest.
[130:48.60]Alright.
[130:54.38]Ugh.
[130:59.16]Bad.
[131:02.06]Uh.
[131:03.10]Triple X Jossie Igo.
[131:09.41]Just gave seven community subs.
[131:10.65]Thanks a lot, Triple X.
[131:15.05]Why are pills so bad?
[131:18.63]They kind of just are.
[131:20.47]You can get extra luck.
[131:21.55]Doesn't Cain buy... I have the luck foot.
[131:23.37]Doesn't that make pills better?
[131:24.76]Doesn't Cain... No, not in this one.
[131:34.20]Only in the flash one, no.
[131:35.44]I want a coffee.
[131:38.63]Where do I get coffee from?
[131:50.31]So I gotta get rid of this book, because the book's not gonna do anything anymore.
[131:59.55]It does not actually change the delay.
[132:01.55]It just tiers up.
[132:05.88]Keep the book.
[132:11.28]It's not gonna do anything though, is it?
[132:13.70]Put a coffee maker in your study, you foot.
[132:18.17]But you got the quotes right, but you got the word wrong.
[132:19.83]It's office?
[132:21.33]My office?
[132:32.04]Coffee in quotes?
[132:33.08]Why?
[132:35.84]Ooh, this is a tricky little room.
[132:41.78]We need to experiment.
[132:43.28]Here comes an experiment.
[132:46.32]Doesn't do anything anymore.
[132:48.35]That kind of sucks.
[132:49.75]It's not having the delay.
[132:51.38]That's kind of annoying.
[132:53.32]Well, now I know I need to do active.
[132:56.74]It should add delay.
[132:57.64]Oh.
[133:12.69]Shoelaces.
[133:13.85]For what?
[133:16.33]Why'd you write that?
[133:18.46]Why'd you highlight that?
[133:21.54]You making fun of me?
[133:22.64]That's supposed to be like a joke?
[133:24.52]Making fun of me or something?
[133:25.66]What's that mean?
[133:26.16]Why'd he write that?
[133:33.39]Thinks he's fucking wicked funny.
[133:35.83]You know, shoelaces.
[133:36.67]You like fucking don't tie them and you trip on them and shit because you're an idiot.
[133:40.05]You don't know how to tie your shoes.
[133:41.11]Fuck that guy.
[133:41.81]You know what I mean?
[133:42.23]Like, what the fuck?
[133:43.09]Ban that person.
[133:44.75]Fucking shit for me and shit.
[133:58.62]velcro shoes don't knock velcro shoes because who cares but so sorry it'd be cool to wear shoes that you don't have to worry about tying you just put them on and go why is that a problem that's not even a problem that's a good thing
[134:29.85]I'm so fucking mad right now.
[134:31.39]Like, what the fuck?
[134:32.09]Two laces.
[134:34.33]Fucking idiot.
[134:35.41]Why'd you say that to me?
[134:37.89]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[134:38.45]Experimental pill.
[134:46.11]Luck up?
[134:47.85]My luck is zero?
[134:48.88]No, luck down.
[134:54.52]Well, I gained the shot speed that I took from the other pill.
[134:56.62]What is this?
[134:57.48]Credit card?
[135:00.21]What does the credit card do?
[135:04.08]Credit card.
[135:06.28]Removes the price tag from all items in the current shop or devil deal, making everything free.
[135:15.99]So, okay.
[135:19.43]Holy shit, don't accidentally press R1.
[135:23.85]But I want to go to the item room.
[135:29.30]Did I go in the item room yet?
[135:31.50]Credit card, that's awesome.
[135:36.32]It's 0%- Yeah, do I- Does it- Do I have to do this?
[135:41.87]Wait, did I do the- I don't remember.
[135:43.29]Did I do- I fucking hate the dumb question mark rooms.
[135:45.29]Okay, jump.
[136:00.94]You call yourself a Jerma985 fan?
[136:02.64]Well, that's me.
[136:20.53]This worm is so good.
[136:23.97]The worm, this worm is so good.
[136:27.52]This should be a pretty clear victory.
[136:40.23]I knew that bomb... Jerma, can we get some tips in this game?
[136:43.13]Well, I knew that bomb was going to kill all the enemies in the middle, so I went to the guy in the top left.
[136:49.22]Bob's brain?
[136:49.88]Sick!
[137:04.24]It wants me to take it so bad.
[137:06.70]Okay, everything in here is free.
[137:16.96]Save it for the devil room.
[137:18.26]Hold on.
[137:18.56]Wait, wait, wait.
[137:18.90]What's this ring?
[137:22.31]What is that thing?
[137:25.35]The cheat sheet.
[137:25.99]See if I can find it.
[137:27.67]Here it is.
[137:28.55]Mom's bracelet.
[137:29.57]Upon use, so it's active, Mom's bracelet allows you to grab objects in the room and throw them, damaging any enemies which are hit.
[137:39.16]Pots, rocks, etc.
[137:40.42]That's, I mean, cool, but
[137:51.56]What's the charge on it?
[137:52.33]I mean, I have seven.
[137:57.61]I mean, just get it.
[137:58.55]I can buy it, yeah.
[138:03.48]I can do what?
[138:04.10]I can do it every room.
[138:07.64]Use the credit card?
[138:08.52]I'm going to use the credit card on the devil deals.
[138:09.80]How could you forget about Bob?
[138:12.74]Because Bob kills me every time I play.
[138:17.81]Dude, there might be an opportunity with the three items in the devil room.
[138:21.31]I'm not getting Bob's brain.
[138:22.67]No, that's an instant run ruiner.
[138:31.24]This is a shit room.
[138:32.16]Imagine if I had Bob's brain right there.
[138:39.12]I know what would happen.
[138:41.10]There's a tinted rock.
[138:45.30]It did rock re.
[138:46.82]It did rock re.
[138:48.98]Where?
[138:49.30]Right here.
[138:49.99]Nice.
[138:55.03]Thank you guys so much.
[138:56.27]Thank you.
[138:56.85]Thank you.
[138:58.31]Close that cheat sheet so I don't get in-game video lag.
[139:05.33]Now I gotta fight the boss.
[139:07.98]Can I throw a rocket?
[139:09.10]How much damage does it do?
[139:12.06]Wait, I'll try it here.
[139:17.30]Does this explode?
[139:22.98]Wait, I can do it more than once in the same room?
[139:24.67]This is actually pretty good.
[139:42.57]This is really fun.
[139:43.83]Wait, I can just pick up... I can pick the rocks up!
[139:46.45]I can pick the tinted rocks up!
[139:47.76]No bombs!
[139:55.42]That's really good.
[139:56.82]I didn't know that.
[139:57.30]I thought it was gonna be... Cool.
[140:00.18]Wait, let's do this.
[140:02.97]See?
[140:03.39]Nice.
[140:05.85]Alright, let's... Let's go.
[140:09.71]Take the rock with you.
[140:14.25]You can't.
[140:15.27]You can't take it with you.
[140:17.05]Alright, where's this dumb boss room?
[140:28.72]Wait.
[140:32.76]Oh!
[140:41.28]I don't want that.
[140:45.10]Wait, I can just do this forever.
[140:46.66]I can break everything.
[140:47.58]There could be like a... Am I ever going to catch a fucking break with a pill?
[141:01.03]I've not got one good one.
[141:09.89]Never take pills.
[141:10.71]No, I take them.
[141:11.53]I take every single one.
[141:12.61]You're not going to stop me.
[141:16.26]You're not going to stop me.
[141:17.02]I'm going to take every single one.
[141:17.90]Alright, let's go.
[141:30.39]Is this the third run?
[141:31.41]Yeah, technically this is the third attempt.
[141:35.20]Well, I should have... Yeah.
[141:39.96]Cool.
[141:46.12]Come on.
[141:47.34]Something good, please.
[141:49.66]Well, at least I know what it does.
[141:51.08]Alright, where's the boss from?
[142:02.85]Down?
[142:03.11]Left?
[142:08.39]I don't fucking remember.
[142:24.52]Can I break secret room doors with this?
[142:27.78]Can I pick up the TNT?
[142:29.58]Holy shit, you can.
[142:33.84]Can I pick up... Oh, you can't pick up the metal blocks, okay.
[142:42.95]He's going to take 20 minutes every floor doing this.
[142:47.09]I mean, if I get an opportunity to get pills, then... I'm going to do it.
[142:52.48]There's items in these things.
[143:02.26]Addicted.
[143:05.73]That's full health.
[143:07.13]Oh, but the credit card.
[143:21.31]Alpha.
[143:23.41]Why is he doing this?
[143:24.27]Why is he doing this?
[143:25.23]Why is he doing this?
[143:26.17]Why is he doing this?
[143:42.09]Plog, plog, plog, plog, plog, plog, plog, plog.
[143:45.53]Okay, let's go.
[143:48.35]The wretched.
[143:49.04]Alright, easy, man.
[144:03.10]Watch out for the spiders.
[144:06.53]Spiders first priority.
[144:27.11]This worm is so awesome.
[144:30.41]Just correct.
[144:34.42]Alright.
[144:36.32]Come on.
[144:37.30]Anything besides the speed belt.
[144:46.18]No devil room either.
[144:48.02]Well, looks like I'm going to be holding this credit card forever.
[144:59.06]Go faster.
[144:59.82]Another... Why does it have to be like this?
[145:04.04]Imagine if I have fucking Bob's brain.
[145:10.03]Ooh!
[145:10.69]That's good.
[145:14.91]No, I'm not... Okay, I'm not gonna let that... That guy just got in my head.
[145:16.94]He was like, go faster!
[145:17.72]And I'm like, okay, fuck, I've gotta go faster.
[145:28.07]All doors are now open for free.
[145:34.05]Need rocks?
[145:37.89]He's playing mind games, Jerma.
[145:53.84]We're good.
[145:56.66]All the way to the right.
[146:03.26]My range is terrible.
[146:14.80]Wait.
[146:16.68]I missed this game?
[146:18.84]Yeah, we were just, we were talking about it the other day.
[146:20.58]A week or two ago, and it was just like, yeah, I'm just, I haven't played it.
[146:24.42]Like, it's been a while.
[146:25.16]I like this game.
[146:29.62]Wait.
[146:31.20]I've hit, no, you can't pick up spikes.
[146:41.26]I'm like opening all their doors.
[146:42.34]Come here.
[146:49.98]Yeah!
[146:51.84]This item is so much fun.
[146:55.25]I know, give me all objects thrown.
[146:57.71]Plus 100% more damage.
[147:09.42]Anything like that in the game?
[147:24.47]No, I need you to... Can I put it down?
[147:25.83]Sorry.
[147:29.51]Haha, funny poo-poo game.
[147:31.01]I don't know why I said that.
[147:32.82]I'm just... It's so easy to manipulate me to do anything.
[147:52.44]Still missing an item room.
[147:54.56]Which, what the fuck?
[148:04.88]Influencer, influencer, influencer.
[148:06.86]You guys influence me more than I influence you.
[148:08.56]You know that, right?
[148:10.52]You guys have way more influence on things that I do and say than I do to you.
[148:13.98]It's free to open.
[148:23.22]Alright, give me the Steam sail.
[148:24.12]No, the Steam sail doesn't matter.
[148:25.74]These coins don't even matter.
[148:31.06]Well, at least I... I'm playing the casino.
[148:34.15]Wait, does going to the casino with my credit card make all the machines free?
[148:37.43]No?
[148:43.10]Oh.
[148:43.44]Oh well.
[148:49.04]I thought I could sneak in.
[149:04.58]I can't even get that.
[149:05.88]No, it's not worth it.
[149:07.56]Excuse me.
[149:20.29]This is the shiny one.
[149:24.73]Don't push it.
[149:25.94]I know.
[149:26.28]I'm doing alright.
[149:27.22]I don't want to push it.
[149:40.11]Oh, come on.
[149:40.59]What was that jump?
[149:41.61]Bullshit.
[149:52.39]No item room.
[149:53.01]What the fuck?
[149:58.90]I should say... No, I don't feel like having that be one of the three times I say that word all year.
[150:06.29]Is that full health?
[150:10.07]Is there a sacrifice room anywhere?
[150:11.41]No.
[150:16.45]No, the word's kind of moist.
[150:20.15]Hey, Wingman, thanks for the five community subs, Wingman.
[150:22.27]Appreciate that.
[150:23.08]Five subs.
[150:27.92]Thank you, Wingman.
[150:33.46]Where's the...
[150:35.49]I hate when the room is so big.
[150:36.81]I can't even... It's too big.
[150:38.17]I can't even, like, see it.
[150:40.25]I can't... Where's the item room?
[150:41.75]Did I already go in it?
[150:42.51]I don't remember.
[150:43.07]I wish I could see.
[150:46.40]I was rushed in bed.
[150:51.94]What's the weird... What's the sock do?
[151:01.77]Stay away from it.
[151:05.63]Nothing?
[151:11.15]Pick up the fire?
[151:11.89]I don't think you can do that.
[151:20.76]God damn it!
[151:21.32]I hate those!
[151:21.98]I panic when I see them.
[151:42.69]pick it up pick it up great all these doors open for free
[152:08.84]Uh, this is full health.
[152:10.14]Clown poop is full health.
[152:11.84]But... I'm not gonna need it.
[152:24.07]I'm not gonna blow it up, though.
[152:25.03]I'm just gonna save it.
[152:25.65]In case I need it.
[152:26.87]I'm gonna do everything else around it.
[152:29.61]Like, I'm gonna fucking remember where this room is.
[152:35.04]The mulligan.
[152:35.74]They grow inside.
[152:37.82]Mulligan?
[152:48.40]Is an amazing item.
[152:51.22]Mulligan.
[152:54.10]Isaac has a 1 sixth chance to spawn a blue fly when one of his tiers hits an enemy.
[153:01.38]Picking up this item as well as two other fly type items will allow you to transform into the Lord of the Flies.
[153:08.90]Wait.
[153:09.79]This is a 1 out of 6 chance?
[153:13.59]On hitting any enemy.
[153:15.35]I need a ton of tiers up then.
[153:18.55]That's awesome.
[153:19.33]That's really good.
[153:20.05]Okay.
[153:21.59]So... Just don't fuck it up.
[153:29.40]Now I need the boss room.
[153:33.36]Rock?
[153:35.46]Get soy milk.
[153:36.46]That would be amazing.
[153:37.98]Rock.
[153:39.01]Rock.
[153:40.95]I've been on this floor for an hour.
[153:43.43]I know, it's because I'm picking up every rock and throwing it into the wall.
[153:46.41]I'm sorry.
[153:49.98]Just wait until you don't watch me play Luigi's Mansion.
[153:52.62]Where's that boss room?
[154:07.07]Yes, the secret room.
[154:08.27]I'm not going to be able to do that.
[154:18.46]Alright, here we go.
[154:19.58]It's also full health right here, too.
[154:23.68]Chad.
[154:26.14]Well, guaranteed to get Chad, right?
[154:28.84]You see Chad, that means you get Chad.
[154:36.17]Those things are just spawning like crazy, huh?
[154:39.13]Need a ton more Tears Up, though.
[154:40.37]Give me some crazy Tears Up items.

[157:38.83]Wheel of Fortune.
[157:40.92]Okay.
[157:41.86]Cool.
[157:42.60]Now... Throw a rock at the machine?
[157:46.78]I don't have all day.

[158:19.41]Alright, whatever.
[158:20.99]Credit card is going to be over here.
[158:22.93]And then... Alright, I've got to think of a good strategy.
[158:27.53]So this is to go... We're going to use this right now.
[158:29.23]We're going to go to the item room for free.
[158:33.24]Alright.
[158:33.92]Robo baby.
[158:38.12]Robo baby is pretty good.
[158:47.20]Dude, fuck even using tears.
[158:49.74]I'm better with the rock throwing than I am with actually shooting tears in the game.
[158:52.64]So why would I use them?
[159:06.98]Okay.
[159:07.98]We're going to make our way up there.
[159:09.66]That long room.
[159:13.94]There's a tinted rock.
[159:17.69]Yep.
[159:18.51]Um, yep.
[159:19.56]That's damage up.
[159:20.54]Oh yeah.
[159:21.42]Yep.
[159:21.76]Oh, oh yeah.
[159:30.72]I didn't even see it.
[159:33.60]Not a great room to be in, but it's okay.
[159:37.10]Not a great room.
[159:38.36]Very, very, very tricky, very difficult, hard video game.
[159:57.18]Wait, what am I thinking?
[160:03.43]Wait, don't do that.
[160:04.09]I need... What was that?
[160:05.83]A tinted rock?
[160:08.39]Okay, hold on.
[160:15.63]We're good.
[160:26.29]Oh boy, just stay back here.
[160:27.51]Don't let anybody get near you.
[160:35.14]Okay.
[160:37.11]Robo baby can handle the rest of this.
[160:59.38]Whoa!
[161:10.63]Got a card.
[161:20.98]The world!
[161:21.72]I can see all the- everything.
[161:23.78]It's a double.
[161:27.23]I'm amped the fuck up right now.
[161:29.00]Like, I gotta calm down.
[161:30.20]I'm amped the fuck up.
[161:43.87]He's popping off.
[161:46.51]Are there any other skulls or anything in here?
[161:48.15]No?
[161:49.01]Alright, I'm gonna go to the right to get the... their item room.
[161:55.62]Haha, Jojo.
[161:56.46]Haha.
[161:56.68]What's going on in chat here?
[161:57.90]What are you guys doing?
[162:02.14]Why is everybody freaking out in the chat room?
[162:03.48]Ooh.
[162:04.65]Vision.
[162:05.43]Oh, I can't hold this till the next room, though.
[162:08.25]I gotta bring the credit card.
[162:13.13]Although, I might be able to use the credit card at the devil room if we get one.
[162:18.94]Whatever.
[162:19.14]We've got constant conflict.
[162:27.37]Where is he?
[162:27.73]Oh, fuck.
[162:27.99]Where is he?
[162:28.29]I don't know where he is.
[162:29.95]Where is he?
[162:30.31]Where is he?
[162:30.67]Where is he?
[162:31.05]Spawn already.
[162:31.89]Come on.
[162:32.49]Where is he?
[162:33.69]Oh, shit.
[162:35.45]Scary stuff.
[162:44.44]A big room.
[162:44.86]Are you making a JoJo reference?
[162:49.89]No.
[162:52.35]I missed the rock.
[162:54.65]Unbelievable.
[162:57.83]No, I'm not making a JoJo reference.
[163:00.65]Oh, fuck you, Jeremy.
[163:04.48]What have I done?
[163:12.79]I can still get it.
[163:13.37]I think I can.
[163:14.79]With a bomb?
[163:15.23]I might be able to get it with a bomb.
[163:24.57]Alright, can I blow that across?
[163:25.83]I can't.
[163:27.03]I might be able to pixel touch it.
[163:28.03]Hold on.
[163:39.25]Nope.
[163:40.21]I blew it.
[163:41.65]Oops, wrong button.
[163:51.88]Here we go.
[163:53.56]Joker.
[163:55.42]What does Joker do?
[164:03.92]Does it just take you to the devil room?
[164:09.93]Should I not use this, though?
[164:11.27]If I use this, I don't have the credit card.
[164:14.17]I don't have the credit card.
[164:23.36]Just use and leave.
[164:24.28]No, if I use and leave, won't the door close?
[164:26.10]I don't think this is even worth using the credit card on.
[164:46.03]The goat head maybe so I can get more options.
[164:54.20]Okay.
[164:55.58]I'm not getting both.
[164:56.58]I'm not getting both.
[164:57.26]I don't know.
[164:57.82]No, I'm not getting both.
[164:59.50]I'm not getting both.
[165:03.80]That's too many hearts.
[165:05.10]There's two fucking hearts.
[165:07.56]Do you think I'm capable of beating Mega Satan with this shit?
[165:29.86]I think this is another familiar, right?
[165:33.00]Sticky friend, little gish.
[165:38.93]Boom.
[165:40.75]Power.
[165:41.27]Just use it.
[165:45.03]That skips the thing that I was going to do.
[165:46.86]Okay.
[165:52.72]I got so many random items all over the place.
[165:56.30]Damn it.
[165:56.84]This is just...
[165:58.74]Too much to think about.
[165:59.86]Okay, let's... Should I go... Use the poop cart in the big room.
[166:07.08]I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[166:08.92]Yeah, I'll do that right now.
[166:10.87]While I'm thinking about it.
[166:11.59]I want to do it in a huge room.
[166:20.45]One that's very, very... Like, there's a lot of space in here.
[166:25.94]Any rocks to throw?
[166:26.64]No.
[166:43.53]Come on, spawn.
[166:46.05]Spawn.
[166:47.95]Good.
[166:49.23]Good.
[166:55.72]Get him, robo baby.
[166:56.60]I don't even want to walk over there.
[166:58.92]Okay.
[167:07.73]Card against humanity.
[167:13.52]We're going to be here for a long time.
[167:18.15]Robo, baby!
[167:18.67]You can clear whole lanes.
[167:19.73]Holy shit.
[167:20.35]Wait a minute.
[167:20.71]Alright, we're looking for the golden poop thing.
[167:29.04]Whatever it is.
[167:34.56]You can just clear an entire lane.
[167:35.92]That's a weird hitbox.
[167:48.59]Nice.
[167:48.93]This is ridiculous.
[167:51.09]I'm going to have a lot of money.
[168:00.47]This one.
[168:00.93]Right here.
[168:01.21]Up a little higher.
[168:02.87]Good.

[168:54.05]Every poop gone?
[169:09.82]Okay.

[171:23.87]You dropped the poo.
[171:26.13]I don't want the petrified poo.
[171:28.71]What are you talking about?
[171:29.43]I don't want it.
[171:31.74]I didn't pick it up because I don't want the damn thing.
[171:38.06]Oh shit, this is gonna get ugly.

[172:03.30]I guess.
[172:12.63]Okay.
[172:16.47]Don't be greed.
[172:16.97]Alright.
[172:18.39]Oh, that's a... This is pay to win, right?
[172:24.49]Don't you just press it and you just fucking kill every enemy?
[172:36.29]It's bad.
[172:36.69]It's useless, is it?
[172:37.51]It does no damage.
[172:43.74]It's trash.
[172:48.14]I have so many coins, though.
[172:49.32]Yeah.
[172:51.37]It's good, but not for a rock good.
[173:15.24]Alright, it's stuck.
[173:15.90]I don't want to buy any of this stuff.
[173:25.52]I'm not getting rid of this.
[173:26.22]This thing is so... It's so good.
[173:27.62]Okay, so now we go... Down, right, down, right, down, right, down, down.
[173:41.12]Oh.

[173:58.79]There's a super secret room.
[174:07.13]Down right.
[174:10.62]Ah.
[174:13.80]Bad place to start in this room.
[174:16.06]Bad placement.
[174:19.24]No secret hinted.
[174:22.69]I know what to do here.
[174:23.37]Oh my God.
[174:25.83]That's okay.
[174:26.31]I always blew that.
[174:31.90]Nice.
[174:33.62]This is shot speed down.
[174:35.24]I found pills.
[174:38.20]Okay.
[174:42.08]And then two strengths.
[174:48.29]Double strength.
[174:49.41]Alright.
[174:49.89]Well, I can use them each boss.
[174:54.20]That'll work out.
[174:57.63]I got baited the last time doing this.
[175:00.59]How would I throw it over there?
[175:41.25]Come on, baby, get him.

[186:41.72]I have, like, five full heals.
[186:48.70]I have, like, I have, like, a full heal.
[186:50.38]I can just go walk on it, like, ten times.
[186:51.86]What do you mean it's not worth it?
[186:54.58]Why wouldn't that be worth it?
[186:55.34]I didn't even know that was behind me.

[187:04.67]I'm going to do it.

[187:52.27]Actually, I don't think I've ever done this before.
[187:55.15]What happens if you do this like 50 times?
[187:59.23]Wrong fucking door.
[188:00.03]I'm not sure I've ever had an opportunity in all the hours I've played this game to actually do this.
[188:09.20]You have to get something good for doing this, right?
[188:15.44]You get lots of items.
[188:16.84]Psycho, you don't know.
[188:18.00]Don't do it more than 12 times.
[188:19.94]How many times have I done it so far?
[188:20.96]What the fuck?
[188:32.80]What the fuck?
[188:45.77]What?
[188:49.36]WHAT?
[188:53.04]Bullshit.
[189:05.46]You're throwing?
[189:06.38]I don't even know what that fucking thing does after that much.
[189:12.75]Okay, we're good.
[189:13.47]We have health.

[190:25.82]This sucks.
[190:29.09]Ooh, and it's Krampus' head.
[190:31.49]I mean, the item's good, but... It takes too long to charge, and it's really... Is it really that... I mean, it's alright.
[190:47.51]use the joker card now it's not rock throw good if we're at the end of the game right now so is rock throw even are we even capable of using rock throw anymore alright now use the joker card right no
[191:16.14]I don't know, that just brings me here.
[191:17.48]What if I can't even... Next... What about the credit card?
[191:23.56]Why would I... I need the credit card.
[191:29.26]Sacrifice one more and then use the Joker card immediately.
[191:39.76]Why?
[191:40.06]No shops for the credit card.
[191:44.82]But what if the devil runs?
[191:47.57]Tad is fucking crazy.
[191:53.38]If I bring this down there and I get a devil deal after killing mom, then, I mean, I get a guaranteed devil room and I can use it there.
[192:01.58]I'm keeping the credit card.
[192:09.89]There's no items there.
[192:11.31]Credit card is useless.
[192:12.17]What?
[192:15.11]You have seven hearts.
[192:16.31]Yeah, I need them all.
[192:22.20]You'll never know what happens.
[192:23.96]Take credit card.
[192:24.82]Dude, you can't be this stupid.
[192:28.70]What are you talking about?
[192:29.76]I have the goat's head on.
[192:32.88]I have... One more floor to do after this.
[192:38.75]Two more, actually, right?
[192:47.06]How are there no more devil deals?
[192:48.04]I have to kill... It lives, and then I have to go to...
[192:51.39]Hell.
[192:52.71]I can't get a Devildale room with it lives?
[192:54.93]What are you talking about?
[193:01.64]I'm just gonna... I know.
[193:02.68]That's what I'm... I know what to do.
[193:04.98]You can.
[193:05.36]You can.
[193:05.72]You can.
[193:05.98]I know.
[193:06.26]Why is everybody freaking out about this?
[193:19.80]Ohhhhhh I know why everyone's doing this.
[193:23.52]Because there are no items in that room.
[193:27.07]It's a devil room, but it's just a trap door to hell.
[193:31.71]Right.
[193:33.57]Okay.
[193:35.15]So, effectively, I'm going to skip it live.
[193:44.98]But don't I want the item?
[193:48.66]I don't fucking know.
[193:49.30]I'm going.
[193:51.10]I'm not doing the sacrifice.
[193:51.90]I don't know what it does.
[193:52.68]I don't know.
[193:53.06]If I step on that one more time, it might instantly kill me.
[193:58.91]Alright, so I'm going to use the joker.
[194:01.47]And... Cool.
[194:04.05]Whatever happened to this no item?
[194:15.24]I'm not taking this.
[194:41.49]Oh, it sucks him in.
[194:42.27]That's cool.
[194:42.73]Okay.
[194:46.81]Just kill this guy immediately.
[194:53.43]Ooh, luck down.
[194:55.97]That's not an ooh.
[194:57.51]That's a no.
[194:58.27]I saw a dollar.
[195:04.53]I saw a dollar.
[195:25.40]Watch out.
[195:36.53]This item was not worth two hearts.
[195:38.99]At all.
[195:40.60]This is like... This is like as mediocre as you could possibly get.
[195:44.42]I gave up getting hit two times to get the fun rift item that doesn't even do anything.
[195:55.62]By the way, no rocks on this whole level.
[195:59.26]What is that?
[196:01.69]Chewed pen?
[196:03.03]What does a chewed pen do?
[196:05.51]Look at it up.
[196:09.76]Tears have a chance to slow enemies.
[196:12.14]Is it?
[196:19.76]That's actually... But look at my... No, that's not worth it.
[196:23.36]Because look at the... My luck is terrible.
[196:31.29]Oh, I can throw this.
[196:31.83]Nice.
[196:46.96]Good thing I kept that rock.
[196:51.00]Not the rock, you know what I'm saying.
[196:56.38]The throwing ability.
[197:09.53]Ooh, fuck!
[197:11.91]Oh, this is not good.
[197:12.77]I think there's hearts everywhere.
[197:18.95]I think I have little Chad with me.
[197:37.64]Can't throw that poop.
[197:38.78]It hurts if you touch it.
[197:48.39]Can't believe I traded two fucking heart containers for this.
[197:50.51]This is going to end up killing me.
[197:52.57]I know it.
[198:06.14]Fucking Bob's brain again.
[198:07.26]Got it.
[198:16.73]Okay.
[198:27.45]Do I have plenty of hearts?
[198:45.26]28 keys.
[198:45.94]I need a key guy.
[198:54.49]What the fuck?
[198:58.61]What is that?
[198:59.37]Hold on.
[199:03.19]Is that going to skip the floor?
[199:05.53]Some of those trapdoors... Wait, is that going to...

[199:47.95]No!
[199:49.13]What?
[199:49.43]Are you kidding me?
[199:54.27]No!
[199:56.79]Where's my card?
[199:58.53]No, I swear to God I have a credit card.
[199:59.97]I can pay for this.
[200:07.80]These items are all bad.
[200:08.74]Yeah, they actually kind of... Yeah, they are.
[200:14.10]It makes me upset that I can't have them for free.
[200:18.48]Wait, I can just skip this whole thing.
[200:20.12]I want to fight it lives to get the item.
[200:25.29]Get the Bible and just kill Satan immediately.
[200:26.91]That's true.
[200:27.63]I can do that.
[200:31.35]Let's do it.
[200:35.58]Wait, that doesn't kill Satan immediately, does it?
[200:42.08]I thought it does it.
[200:48.00]Oh no.
[200:53.19]Now you're throwing.
[200:55.51]No, but I'm not throwing.
[200:57.07]You're throwing me.
[200:58.15]Does this do anything else?
[201:03.99]Does it give you like a heart or something?
[201:05.13]I fucking can't believe I just wasted that.
[201:19.77]I'm going to stop listening to you guys.
[201:21.17]You guys are always out to get me.
[201:22.47]You're out to get me.
[201:27.14]No one can throw you without the bracelet.
[201:28.68]That's pretty good.
[201:31.80]Alright, whatever.
[201:32.22]Let's go.
[201:46.85]Bad damage still.
[201:48.16]Oh, that's... This thing sucks!
[201:54.06]This is making it a way harder game.
[201:57.16]Oh, no!
[202:08.53]Get the fuck away from me.
[202:10.29]What's the devil do?
[202:11.27]There's no... What about permanent health loss?
[202:20.83]Let's go.
[202:22.70]The Bible instantly kills.
[202:23.88]It lives.
[202:24.20]Alright.
[202:26.76]I gotta kill... Who am I going for?
[202:28.76]It doesn't really matter, does it?
[202:31.98]It doesn't matter.

[203:11.18]Wealth of power.
[203:16.30]I think... I know the worms better.
[203:19.96]Tell me if you find a tinted rock.
[203:22.96]That just makes it... I can charge, right?
[203:29.76]I'm making this game so much harder with... That's gonna kill me.
[203:33.82]The take the cool item when I fight Satan, it's gonna scramble all of his projectiles and I'm gonna die.
[203:40.56]And I'm gonna die to Satan again.
[203:42.40]The second time.
[203:42.93]This is gonna be a disaster.
[203:52.95]Oh, it's Isaac!
[203:53.81]Even worse!
[203:54.61]Isaac has more projectiles!
[203:57.61]Isaac has like three times as many projectiles.
[204:07.08]This is gonna be a fucking disaster.
[204:21.32]Oops.

[206:21.10]Good.
[206:22.54]Good.
[206:27.00]Okay.
[206:28.10]And I got another heart container.
[206:29.76]So that's good.
[206:30.62]This is probably going to be fine.
[206:38.37]Use Bracelet on Isaac and throw him.
[206:43.25]I can't do that, man.
[206:45.63]I can't do that.
[206:56.32]You can.
[206:58.32]You don't know that.
[206:59.64]I'll take contact damage if I touch him.
[207:09.25]You can and you will.
[207:15.05]Oh, sorry.
[207:15.49]Wait, was that a... No, you can and you will.
[207:19.33]Is that what you're doing?
[207:20.61]Don't touch that.
[207:25.83]That's what they were doing, I think.
[207:31.70]Oh, fuck.
[207:32.46]Never seen these enemies.
[207:33.60]I've seen these guys without those ones.
[207:37.35]This mod is weird.
[207:38.09]It adds a bunch of weird enemies.
[207:39.65]Tinted rock.
[207:42.83]Where?
[207:45.87]There's no tinted rock here.
[207:58.51]What's up?
[208:00.41]Oh, come on, man.
[208:07.26]What's this do?
[208:07.92]You pick up coins and it makes you fart, right?
[208:10.59]Swallowed penny.
[208:13.19]What does it do?
[208:21.33]Getting hit makes you drop.
[208:27.21]I need to spend this somewhere.
[208:29.79]I need a donation machine or something.
[208:34.85]Drops coins when you take damage.
[208:36.15]Oh, okay.
[208:46.72]Chocolate bar.
[208:47.52]Mysterious candy.
[208:48.36]Uh-oh.
[208:49.08]I think this thing sucks.
[208:49.70]Yeah, this thing sucks, right?
[209:00.20]Oh, I got saved.
[209:01.02]Alright.
[209:12.71]Anybody?
[209:12.99]Any tinted rocks?
[209:23.65]They have like a little X on it, right?
[209:37.19]Take out the adds, please.
[209:38.21]I hate the fucking weasels!
[209:55.54]Alright, well, here we go.
[210:03.44]Full health.
[210:05.02]Uh, tons of money.
[210:05.76]Let's kill Isaac.
[210:08.96]I'm not picking him up.
[210:09.56]Don't even say it.
[210:12.48]My god.
[210:14.70]Don't.
[210:15.06]Please don't do the thing.
[210:16.02]It's gonna do it.
[210:16.56]Ah!
[210:39.91]Don't move.
[210:43.53]We're good.
[210:54.92]I hate that.
[210:59.58]The Rift makes it easy?
[211:00.58]No, the Rift... The Rift, not for me.
[211:02.70]I'd rather just dodge them.
[211:04.80]Than have to worry about them spinning around in random circles.
[211:08.97]Because after the rift is over, it fucking throws like that, see?
[211:11.37]I thought that was a portal for a second.
[211:17.31]Pick him up for the good ending.
[211:18.39]Alright, do we go further down?
[211:24.11]Or is that... I haven't beat the game enough times, right?
[211:30.52]Now we go further.
[211:31.18]Alright, we're in the chest.
[211:42.19]all this stuff okay we have magnetic tears um poison tears fortune cookie reusable fortunes may your troubles be many and then we have the original game from the first game back in 2011 and I'm surprised they haven't deleted it yet because it is so bad that it's not even worth picking this up
[212:18.50]I can't pick up chests?
[212:22.14]There's the Mega Satan door, but obviously we're not doing that.
[212:24.76]We're gonna go kill question mark, question mark, question mark, right?
[212:27.76]If I can even get to him.
[212:33.54]Those are really bad items in those chest rooms.
[212:37.80]Those are terrible.
[212:49.65]What was that?
[212:51.97]Epic hack.
[212:52.53]Explosive.
[212:54.97]What have I done?
[212:56.97]Wait.
[212:57.27]No, this is good, isn't it?
[212:58.10]This is good.
[212:59.18]This is going to kill me.
[212:59.94]This is just Bob's brain.
[213:01.80]But I can do it every one second.
[213:06.54]This is Bob's brain.
[213:07.40]You do it every one second.
[213:09.68]I think I might have ruined the whole run.
[213:14.62]Oh my god.
[213:19.95]Wait!
[213:21.49]They suck!
[213:22.51]They suck to enemies!
[213:24.23]That's insane!
[213:25.47]I still have the worm!
[213:27.77]Magnetic Tears, Epic Hack, and the worm!
[213:30.45]Holy shit, that was insane!
[213:37.78]Who's this guy?
[213:47.34]Actually, not that bad.
[213:48.16]Oh, and there's another buddy.
[213:49.24]Little chubby.
[213:51.07]Look, we got the whole Wizard of Oz here.
[213:52.41]There's five people in Wizard of Oz?
[213:56.44]Yeah, there's four people and a dog.
[214:11.91]Dude, that's so weird.
[214:12.93]It just goes in a random direction.
[214:17.41]Fuck.
[214:18.75]I don't know where it's gonna go.
[214:25.04]You're the dog.
[214:26.00]Oh, yeah, I kind of am.
[214:26.78]I have, like, the head, right?
[214:30.68]Alright, I need health.
[214:35.02]Homing... Homing crit rocket.
[214:37.86]Yes.
[214:46.19]Watch out.
[214:46.47]It's gonna get... It's gonna suck on one of those things.
[214:50.45]I just got freaked out because I thought it came on hearts.
[214:52.67]Oh, God.
[214:53.19]Great.
[214:54.09]Extra health.
[214:54.63]That's actually... Why am I upset about that?
[214:56.60]That's good.
[215:05.78]God damn it.
[215:06.54]Why did that just suck to me?
[215:07.70]Fuck this thing, man.

[215:59.58]Alright, I need this.
[216:00.82]I'm taking this from now on.
[216:01.87]There's too many people on the screen.
[216:07.95]Okay, I need this.
[216:09.27]It could drop... Forget about the rocks.
[216:12.32]There are no rocks to throw in this one.
[216:16.16]I'm getting so...
[216:35.34]range on these is bad too.
[216:36.76]Alright, give me some hearts.
[216:37.62]Am I going to go in every single room without finding the fucking boss?
[216:43.12]Blind?
[216:43.44]Blind.
[216:46.30]What do you mean blind?
[216:50.99]What's going on?
[216:52.87]The icon is there.
[216:55.99]What?
[216:57.27]He missed a rock.
[216:58.57]Wait, what's going on?
[217:12.07]Holy shit, that was bad.
[217:13.71]Thank you, finally.
[217:15.74]Another one.
[217:16.94]Yes, good.
[217:19.14]You missed a wink?
[217:20.08]Oh, sorry.
[217:26.90]How many motherfuckers are in here?
[217:28.30]Oh, it's the whole Wizard of Oz!
[217:31.51]I used that joke already.
[217:32.57]It's the... Every Deadly Sin.
[217:43.31]I just used that.
[217:47.02]Double -2.
[217:50.60]Don't touch anything.
[217:51.42]Just let him kill him.
[217:58.26]Okay.
[218:02.03]Let's go in every single fucking room before finding the boss.
[218:05.91]That would be really, really swell.
[218:07.29]Alright, I'm gonna take this.
[218:09.27]I'll take it.
[218:09.97]I'll use it.
[218:10.29]Oh, I can't even use it.
[218:18.30]Let's kill both of your friends.
[218:19.40]Oh, fuck you, man.
[218:32.01]Why can't I fire?
[218:32.65]Something good.
[218:37.22]High Priest is the worst.
[218:38.40]I'm going up.
[218:42.74]Save it for the boss.
[218:52.44]I can't wait to see.
[218:53.20]I'll kill it with the feather.
[219:05.31]It's so stupid.
[219:06.15]Alright, we got full health.
[219:09.51]I can find the secret room too.
[219:10.93]Triple Loki's.
[219:26.26]Good.
[219:29.22]Uh... Secret room.
[219:31.78]Just... maybe up here?
[219:33.51]Nope.
[219:35.15]I have a headache.
[219:36.11]Uh, maybe take Tylenol.
[219:45.29]I'm getting... I'm gonna... Tears up plus knockback.
[219:51.09]I'm getting every single one of those.
[219:56.35]Alright, we gotta check the secret room here.
[219:58.55]No.
[220:00.13]No.
[220:02.80]What the f- I- I wanna find the secret room.
[220:27.43]Nope.
[220:30.72]Nope.
[220:32.56]Nope.
[220:34.46]Nope.
[220:37.42]That's good.
[220:38.00]That's okay.
[220:38.44]I got... I got... Okay.
[220:43.79]Uh, there we go.
[220:46.89]Uh, nope.
[220:48.09]Nope.
[220:49.51]Nope.
[220:53.25]Do I really care about the secret room?
[220:54.82]Is it really...
[220:56.52]I really didn't give a shit right now.
[221:03.04]What could be possibly in here that I would want?
[221:06.14]I don't think I can find very much that I would care about.
[221:13.86]Where is it?
[221:14.28]Here we go.
[221:26.64]Hey, guys.
[221:29.70]Can I overcharge this like a hundred times?
[221:36.76]What just hurt me?
[221:48.37]I can't.
[221:48.93]I can only do this twice.
[221:54.51]It needs blood.
[221:57.21]Static doesn't deal damage.
[221:58.71]Oh.
[222:00.01]Okay.
[222:00.69]So I have two.
[222:01.33]Go get the book.
[222:06.02]Oh, I don't need the book.
[222:06.90]Do I need the book?
[222:08.18]I don't need the book.
[222:10.78]Why does he keep teleporting shit around?
[222:13.00]Stop.
[222:15.82]Stop!
[222:16.26]What the fu- Oh my god, dude.
[222:20.32]This thing will be double charged though, right?
[222:28.42]Hook is gone?
[222:28.96]No, it's not a spreader.
[222:33.57]Oh, I see what you mean.
[222:34.35]Just keep... I'm going to blow the fuck out of a lot of you.
[222:39.67]Open.
[222:45.28]This is going to be very, very boring.
[222:46.90]Here we go.
[222:53.01]Do I really need this much of a crutch?
[222:55.13]I don't think I do.
[223:06.33]Don't pick these up unless I get hit.
[223:09.71]This is absolutely thrilling.
[223:20.00]This boss is really easy.
[223:23.57]Yeah, but I also want to prevent me just abso-fucking-lutely embarrassing the shit out of myself and not completing even one, like, hard mode full, like, just typical run of The Binding of Isaac on my stream.
[223:38.07]That would just be... That would be a catastrophe.
[223:44.39]You know what I'm saying?
[223:44.95]I know I'm capable of doing it.
[223:46.23]I've played this game a lot, but I gotta have, like, a security here.
[223:57.18]Because I know that all it takes is one... Like... Oh my god!
[224:01.60]Oh!
[224:01.80]Oh!
[224:02.06]Oh my god!
[224:02.48]Oh no!
[224:02.74]No!
[224:02.92]No!
[224:03.80]You've heard it a hundred times before.
[224:05.04]It's happened a hundred times.
[224:05.78]Alright, that's good enough.
[224:11.95]That's literally... I cannot die.
[224:14.69]I can't die here.
[224:15.57]So I cannot lose.
[224:16.33]One more time.
[224:22.90]Okay.
[224:23.42]That's it.
[224:24.08]Let's go.
[224:28.06]I cannot lose.
[224:28.74]It's impossible to lose this.
[224:30.66]One more.
[224:30.88]Okay, I'm done.
[224:45.31]I want the, uh, I want to beat the guy with the feather thing.
[224:50.07]He's going to start throwing.
[224:51.31]No, it would be so dumb if I were to, like, throw to make somebody laugh once.
[224:56.05]Wait, I want to fill this up double.
[224:59.43]It's like maybe 10 of you in chat that would think that was funny.
[225:02.01]And the rest of you would be like, dude, you just wasted so much fucking time.
[225:04.43]Like, what are you doing, man?
[225:10.33]Alright, I'm ready.
[225:14.72]I'm ready to beat this guy in probably less than 10 seconds.
[225:19.62]I'm gonna win in probably 5 to 10 seconds.
[225:53.08]Spam it!
[225:55.50]Hey, look at that!
[225:56.86]What was it?
[225:57.54]12 seconds?
[226:01.75]Hey, I completed one run of Binding of Isaac on the stream.
[226:04.87]Let's do it again.
[226:24.01]Drive to the Antibirth path.
[226:26.91]What's the specific, um, shit you have to do to go to do the Antibirth stuff?
[226:38.17]Where do I go to do Antibirth?
[226:44.70]The Antibirth floor.
[226:45.64]Do I use Samson?
[226:46.72]I love Samson.
[226:51.22]Look it up on your cheater app.
[226:53.41]Why is it an app?
[227:00.37]Unlock by having 12 soul hearts and then just lock.
[227:02.79]Do Eden, coward.
[227:07.14]Eden's just like a... Eden's just free.
[227:20.45]It's free.
[227:20.95]You get two items for free.
[227:24.03]What do I have?
[227:24.49]I don't even know what these are.
[227:34.98]What is that?
[227:37.98]Look it up.
[227:38.32]It's a weird mouth dripping.
[227:45.58]Where is it?
[227:45.92]Is it Antibirth?
[227:50.61]There it is.
[227:52.35]Rotten tomato.
[227:53.79]Tears have a chance to mark enemies.
[227:56.55]Marked enemies will be attacked by other enemies.
[227:59.64]I'll try.
[228:02.46]Is that
[228:15.27]penis map yeah sure funny like no not even close not even remotely close what is wrong with you he hates us
[228:44.79]More.
[228:45.81]More!
[228:49.55]More!
[228:52.71]Take it.
[228:53.31]I don't even care what it is.
[228:54.03]Eat it!
[229:05.02]Good.
[229:07.66]Okay.
[229:09.70]Don't even open... Wait, there's two locked doors, though.
[229:14.05]One of these is like a book room or something, right?
[229:19.97]Oh, that's not correct.
[229:20.73]What's that?
[229:23.23]Is it soap?
[229:24.27]What's the pink soap do?
[229:32.28]Rock throw.
[229:33.14]I don't have enough to get rock throw again.
[229:37.66]We've already done rock throw.
[229:38.54]I don't want to do rock throw for another one.
[229:39.70]Alright, what's this?
[229:46.97]No, that sucks.
[229:49.05]Mass room damage.
[229:49.87]I mean, this... This is the only one to take.
[229:54.58]Is it better than having a slot machine, though?
[229:57.22]They're both pretty terrible.
[230:00.36]Look up how to do the Antibirth path.
[230:03.18]Okay, fine.
[230:13.73]Okay.
[230:23.19]Cheating?
[230:23.63]Well, I kind of want to know.
[230:25.71]Chapters.
[230:37.38]Uh... What's it called?
[230:44.53]Any birth introduces four new chapters.
[230:48.12]After unlocking a secret exit, locked doors to the new chapters will appear upon defeating bosses in the first three chapters.
[230:54.09]I don't think I've unlocked it yet.
[230:56.53]How do you unlock a secret exit?
[231:02.58]He's cheating.
[231:03.22]Yeah, of course I... Defeat the three new bosses on the new floors.
[231:09.60]I have to defeat all the bosses.
[231:13.27]Yeah, I have to beat the new people.
[231:22.13]Need to beat Reap Creep.
[231:25.25]Okay, cool.
[231:36.07]Unlock the negative first.
[231:38.75]Yeah, I had to pull, like, my rebirth file.
[231:41.10]I just haven't played in a long time.
[231:42.32]I've uninstalled this game, like, a dozen times over the years.
[231:45.16]And I just don't have the files for any of it.
[231:53.12]Crystal ball is pretty good, too.
[231:54.78]Alright, I'm gonna kill the boss with the... was it the Necronomicon?
[231:58.84]Then I'll take crystal ball.
[231:59.68]Crystal ball's good.
[232:00.50]From what I remember.
[232:02.72]I'm gonna show you the whole world and give you like a card.
[232:05.52]Pretty good.
[232:14.47]Okay, let's go.
[232:16.33]Monstro.
[232:32.89]And then I'm going to press a ball and don't use it.
[232:35.11]I'm going to use it immediately on the next floor.
[232:37.07]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[232:50.64]Taking forever to kill anything.
[232:54.70]Did my voice change?
[232:58.32]Terrible item.
[232:59.06]What do you mean my voice?
[233:00.22]What's going on?
[233:03.44]Why do people keep saying that my voice is, like, high and robotic?
[233:09.86]I mean, it will be right now.
[233:11.42]If I do this?
[233:12.82]Like, this is... Okay, okay, okay.
[233:15.45]But it shouldn't be now.
[233:17.37]Filter's off.
[233:17.95]Give me that chip.
[233:28.96]Let's do the other room.
[233:38.01]He's immersive.
[233:40.59]And I'm getting pretty immersed in the game right now.
[233:43.01]The game's just fun.
[233:48.31]It's just fun to throw a hundred dice in the air and look at them all.
[233:55.91]That's really what this game is.
[234:04.81]Throw a hundred dice in the air and count how many sixes you have.
[234:07.39]And then do it again.
[234:18.05]Just do that IRL.
[234:19.07]That would be so bad.
[234:22.87]That would be so bad.
[234:31.56]This thing is so, so, so key.
[234:38.95]Dice throwing stream.
[234:41.25]What if I did that one day?
[234:43.09]I just got like 30 dice.
[234:45.47]And I was just making random bets with you guys.
[234:48.71]Rose repeat?
[234:49.27]What's this?
[234:49.55]Okay, I'm going to throw dice in the air.
[234:53.41]And if it's anywhere between 20 and 50, then I win.
[234:56.96]And if it's anything else, you win.
[235:07.63]Shit, I don't have any keys.
[235:15.04]Deal.
[235:15.46]That would be such a pain in the ass.
[235:25.28]I'd have to throw a bunch of dice in the air and then suck them all up in a vacuum.
[235:28.01]It would be impossible.
[235:28.85]Key.
[235:30.89]Ugh.
[235:36.46]That's not blowing you up?
[235:37.28]Why?
[235:37.64]How is that possible?
[235:38.96]How are you going to count them?
[235:44.28]I don't know.
[235:45.70]Just they need to be like in a... Right.
[235:50.69]Yes.
[235:51.13]Right.
[235:51.39]How can I count them?
[235:56.17]I don't know.
[236:01.49]I'm trying to find ways to make that not painful.
[236:03.79]Ooh.
[236:04.67]Secrets.
[236:08.80]Thank God.
[236:09.24]Alright, I'm going for it.
[236:11.42]I'm going for it.
[236:11.90]I know people are going to be like, don't do it.
[236:13.22]I'm going for it.
[236:14.08]I'm going to get this first.
[236:15.96]Yep, thank you.
[236:16.82]Yeah, sometimes you make a wish you can play.
[236:18.30]Platinum bar?
[236:21.34]What's that?
[236:28.25]Iron bar.
[236:28.95]Concussive tears.
[236:30.03]Okay.
[236:31.35]Okay.

[237:09.30]Just wanna... Paste, paste, paste, paste.
[237:11.74]That's all I see.
[237:12.94]You guys do realize that, right?
[237:16.40]Anytime there's a huge copypasta that gets thrown in here, I just see, Hey, Jerma.
[237:19.54]Hey, Jerma.
[237:19.86]Hey, Jerma.
[237:20.26]Hey, Jerma.

[237:24.45]I see the first four words.

[238:16.28]You deserved it a little bit.
[238:18.96]Like, I figured you deserved a little bit of, like, just gameplay streaming.

[238:35.27]Good.
[238:35.65]Alright, I'm not opening that door.
[238:38.93]Because I might not find another key the whole fucking game.

[238:46.16]Maybe to find another key?
[238:48.88]Probably, yeah.

[243:21.69]No, no.
[243:21.87]I don't want to use the ball right now.
[243:24.79]Because if I... I want to use... When I go to the next area, it'll show me everything.
[243:35.44]Let's use the donate.
[243:37.00]What are you talking about?
[243:37.72]Donation box.

[243:50.01]Look at how many shit talkers now are telling me to blow up the donation box.
[243:56.80]Cool.
[243:57.14]Great.
[243:59.06]Worthless.
[244:08.85]Alright, let's get out of here.
[244:15.73]Wait.
[244:16.51]No.
[244:18.63]It's good for curse rooms.
[244:21.09]Yeah, it's alright.
[244:21.99]It's not great, but it's not terrible.
[244:31.10]See, this is why I held it.
[244:32.22]Because of that.
[244:34.96]Okay.
[244:36.06]Well, take a run.
[244:36.74]Good.
[244:37.72]This place is kind of small.
[244:39.92]Don't you have bullshit in here?
[244:45.64]Alright.
[244:55.34]Now give me some good damage items and I'll be good to go.
[245:06.62]Look at that fucking demon baby doing work over here.
[245:14.39]Crimestone baby doing fucking work.
[245:24.44]Give me a shitload of damage up and I'll be happy.
[245:30.60]The inner...
[245:35.16]Okay.
[245:36.40]This just got real interesting.
[245:40.00]That's a fog moment right there.
[245:43.59]Yes, it is.
[245:44.23]Alright, now give me Tears Up and Damage Up and then the game is completely actually over.
[245:55.57]Tears Up, Damage Up.
[245:58.81]And this thing is just in the bag completely.
[246:04.81]Dude, don't you love when you just get like a solid build in the first two floors and you're just like, nice.
[246:11.16]Feels pretty good.
[246:12.96]Let's go down and let's go... Get piercing shots?
[246:17.62]That'd be awesome.
[246:24.41]Come on, shoot it.
[246:26.09]Shoot it!
[246:41.19]Aye.
[246:42.31]Please.
[246:43.17]Don't let me go up there.
[246:43.95]Fire rate up doesn't do anything with Spreadshot?
[246:52.06]I mean, I have 21 tears right now.
[246:55.66]Which, that's really slow.
[246:57.06]Tears up items won't affect us?
[246:59.38]Yeah, they will.
[247:06.79]Why wouldn't it?
[247:13.80]Although, I could buy a battery.
[247:15.40]Okay, here's the plan.
[247:17.56]I'm gonna buy a spirit heart and the battery.
[247:20.12]After I do one more room.
[247:29.31]Give me a full stack of spirit hearts.
[247:38.63]Ah, shit.
[247:39.15]I thought he was one of the, uh... You know what I'm saying.
[247:41.93]I thought he was one of these guys on the right here.
[247:51.49]Alright, use it.
[247:55.60]The Joker.
[247:57.86]The Joker.
[247:58.70]Just use it.
[248:00.60]Let's go.
[248:01.98]Rock.
[248:09.19]Alright.
[248:16.28]Krampus.
[248:35.73]The head is good, but it just... I wish it didn't have some... I guess if it had a small charge, it'd be way overpowered.
[248:48.48]You can kill some enemies instantly, can't you?
[248:50.38]Or couldn't you used to?
[248:51.16]Did they patch it or something?
[248:57.51]Oh, fuck.
[248:59.37]Ooh.
[249:01.81]Ain't no getting away from this one.
[249:04.83]Very bad room.
[249:06.23]Very bad room.
[249:20.64]HP up, luck down.
[249:21.72]Fuck yeah.
[249:26.00]I'm not happy about luck, but... Uh...
[249:32.66]Bad, but no, but now I just have spirit hearts.
[249:36.45]We have more than that now.
[249:39.95]Say bad rum five times fast.
[249:43.45]Bad rum.
[249:44.13]Bad rum.
[249:45.41]Bad rum.
[249:45.93]I don't understand what you're talking about.
[249:56.08]Take it again.
[249:57.60]Luck up, shot speed down.
[250:11.92]Okay.
[250:12.96]These stupid fires.
[250:13.83]They mess me up every time.
[250:21.03]That's pretty much it.
[250:24.78]Did I miss anything?
[250:29.02]Battery, but... I need two more rooms.
[250:40.71]Calendrum and boss will give you a... You know what, Ronnie?
[250:44.63]You are fucking really smart.
[250:49.92]It's true.
[251:01.73]More free shit.
[251:02.67]Well, it's not for free.
[251:04.23]I earned it.
[251:04.59]Another one of these.
[251:20.11]What if I use this one and then use this one again?
[251:26.58]You might get the cellar?
[251:28.68]Wait, is it going to make something on the ground?
[251:32.28]Wait, open both.
[251:36.30]Hold on.
[251:36.52]Alright, how can I tell... How can you tell which one it is?
[251:48.52]Hey, ladder.
[251:49.84]Oh, if there's a ladder.
[251:51.12]Alright, what happens if I use this in here?
[251:56.38]Can I use it again?
[251:58.28]Wait, what the fuck?
[252:02.39]Is this a walnut?
[252:04.03]A walnut.
[252:05.43]EO.
[252:06.37]Reroll enemies.
[252:10.83]One charge?
[252:11.43]Is that... Reroll enemies.
[252:20.24]I don't want that.
[252:22.24]I guess you could bring that into the womb and the chest and Galerium land and use it and... It's bad.
[252:32.89]It can reroll high tier enemies though.
[252:35.99]What happens if I use Airwaz right now?
[252:39.23]What happens?
[252:39.61]Does the game break?
[252:47.06]Find out.
[252:54.76]Okay.
[252:55.62]I don't want to go on that one, right?
[252:59.52]If it spawns to the left, you're fucked.
[253:04.37]Do it.
[253:04.85]Do it.
[253:05.27]Do it.
[253:05.79]Don't.
[253:07.23]That just goes to the... Do it.
[253:09.81]No.
[253:10.01]I don't want to do that.
[253:12.11]It'll be epic.
[253:15.35]Get the boss item.
[253:16.31]Yeah, I need to get the boss item.
[253:17.49]I'm not just going to skip.
[253:18.57]You guys are trying to ruin my run.
[253:19.91]Why are you trying to ruin my run?
[253:24.97]We only spend like 12 minutes per floor while I talk to you guys and don't play the game.
[253:30.58]You want me to have to restart all this again?
[253:32.00]Oops.
[253:38.66]I forgot about, uh, hold on.
[253:39.58]Wait, wait, wait.
[253:40.50]Um, we're good.
[254:01.14]I'm playing the game with the demon, baby.
[254:02.98]I'm not even like playing with me.
[254:04.10]I'm trying to aim with the demon.
[254:10.69]Ooh, HP up.
[254:12.85]Here we go.

[254:17.65]Saved, saved, saved.
[254:19.01]Alright, now I'm going to go in the secret tunnel.
[254:28.62]Wasted the Joker?
[254:30.37]No, I'm not going to go in this.
[254:31.11]I'm going to buy the battery.
[254:33.87]See, if you guys weren't here, what would I do?
[254:37.77]What would I do, huh?
[254:39.49]Wait, let me go up.
[254:45.53]I can't skip.
[254:56.48]Okay, I'm not going to use this yet until I get to the next floor.
[254:58.68]Don't tell me to do things that are not smart.
[255:03.99]Here's a wacky challenge.
[255:05.35]Say I lied about eating a shoe five times fast.
[255:09.59]Pretty wacky.
[255:10.05]Okay.

[256:20.19]Keys, come on.
[256:24.93]Yo, this stream is on fucking crack.
[256:32.25]Bullshit.

[256:47.27]Great.
[256:47.79]What a waste.
[256:50.87]What are you guys doing?
[256:51.57]You can bomb into the rooms from the secret room.
[256:56.72]Oh, yeah!
[256:59.26]Yes, you can!
[257:02.49]That's not a cool room.
[257:03.73]This room's stupid.
[257:18.36]Not stupid anymore.
[257:19.14]Okay, save the keys.

[259:17.39]Yeah, fuck it, I can do it.
[259:18.21]You're right, never mind.
[259:19.47]I can just charge it.
[259:20.01]I also want to use Judgment, too.
[259:21.99]Shit.

[261:04.82]Yeah, I don't even want to do it.

[261:08.52]Use the crystal ball?
[261:10.08]No, no, no.
[261:11.36]I'm saving it until I go to the next realm.

[261:22.88]Mom's Pearl.
[261:23.72]It emanates purity.
[261:26.94]What's this do?
[261:28.67]Mom's Pearl.
[261:36.27]Grants a secondary chance of any non-specific heart drop turning into a soul heart.
[261:40.99]Holy shit, that's really good.
[261:45.17]That's unbelievable what I have right now.
[261:47.93]Literally cheating.
[261:48.63]It's a bit... Please.
[261:58.84]It's awful.
[262:01.66]That means they can turn hearts into soul hearts.
[262:03.30]Why wouldn't I want that?
[262:04.04]That's all I need right now.
[262:07.32]This dream would be funny if you didn't cheat.
[262:16.16]Why would the stream be funny?
[262:20.46]Yeah, true.
[262:21.82]What the fuck does that mean?
[262:23.84]Oh, true.
[262:27.77]That makes no sense.
[262:31.37]This is not a comedy stream.
[262:32.77]This is a gaming stream.
[262:35.03]You see the title?
[262:35.81]This is not a comedy stream.
[262:37.17]This is a gamer stream.
[262:41.62]Fuck.
[262:42.34]Why am I testing for secret rooms?
[262:43.70]I already had it.
[262:58.35]Alright, let's kill the boss, please.
[263:05.64]Peek!
[263:13.88]Quickly, come on, spam it up.
[263:22.27]Good.
[263:22.81]He's so good.
[263:23.95]Something, something, something, something.
[263:25.21]What's this?
[263:26.61]Evil range and shot speed up.
[263:30.19]Eh.
[263:31.75]Pretty bad.
[263:37.41]I'm just a true no-comedy gamer streamer who played Africa Photo Game for PlayStation 3.
[263:47.43]Jera Abundance.
[263:50.93]What does Jera do?
[263:56.39]Magician.
[263:57.09]Great.
[263:57.41]What a waste.
[264:01.25]Gera is OP.
[264:03.17]Well, what does it do?
[264:06.57]It doubles any items that are in a room.
[264:08.27]That's actually really good.
[264:13.58]I should just use it right now.
[264:14.36]Use it right now?
[264:17.40]I mean, that's just free money.
[264:18.70]No!
[264:20.20]No!
[264:28.65]You're looking for cards.
[264:30.15]It doubles chest items.
[264:34.96]That's pretty cool.
[264:35.64]All the way to the right.
[265:00.56]Get out of here.
[265:13.99]Die.
[265:14.87]Please.
[265:16.39]Okay.
[265:18.89]Oh, bomb items.
[265:19.86]They suck.
[265:21.34]Burning blast.
[265:23.84]Ugh.
[265:29.51]No.
[265:29.67]How do I get?
[265:31.37]Okay, this is fine.
[265:34.91]Are you saying I can double a chest?
[265:39.07]Oh.
[265:43.00]Where were you when I wanted you before?
[265:46.00]Okay, hold on.
[265:49.93]Here we go.
[266:00.42]Can I double that?
[266:10.71]Manny pack filled with goodies.
[266:12.19]Okay.
[266:17.45]Filled with goodies?
[266:19.24]Only pickups and chests.
[266:28.30]He actually took Manny pack.
[266:32.85]So what?
[266:34.15]This is a free item.
[266:42.96]Why would you not pick up a free passive item?
[266:47.84]Come on.
[266:52.44]Why?
[266:53.07]Twice in a row?
[266:54.97]Whatever.
[267:08.26]What's wrong with Cursed Eye?
[267:18.19]Is the proc rate just so stupidly low or something?
[267:21.35]I don't get it.
[267:24.65]Magician again.
[267:25.34]Worthless.
[267:25.76]Alright, let them die on the spikes!
[267:52.57]Why am I so afraid of this?
[267:54.61]Stand over here.
[267:58.81]Hey!
[268:09.26]Cursed Eye and Mark.
[268:10.60]Did that work out pretty well?
[268:14.57]There's a tinted rock.
[268:16.85]I'll get it.
[268:19.37]Where?
[268:20.51]I see.
[268:26.40]Very good.
[268:28.48]What a keen eye you have.
[268:30.36]Very keen.
[268:41.78]What the hell?
[268:42.28]There's all these little... Yeah, that was kind of wild.
[268:47.00]Alright.
[268:58.05]There's another rock?
[269:02.43]No webcam, ResidentSleeper.
[269:05.90]No, there is no webcam.
[269:07.32]Sorry.
[269:08.58]Why?
[269:09.00]There's no other rock here.
[269:12.03]No webcam, ResidentSleeper.
[269:14.35]I need to be able to smell his face.
[269:28.97]I want to zoom in up his nose.
[269:39.26]Reap creep!
[269:39.66]Here we go!
[269:46.57]And then this will open up the next area?
[269:56.94]Jeez.
[270:01.90]These new bosses are fucking hard.
[270:04.44]They have a lot of health too.
[270:15.61]What did he just fire?
[270:24.96]What the fuck was that?
[270:33.72]How long does he do this for?
[270:47.71]Oh!
[270:48.33]Die!
[270:48.67]Okay, I'm good.
[270:53.01]More range up.
[270:54.51]Fucking useless.
[271:09.25]Take the paw.
[271:10.25]No.
[271:10.83]Do I have another guppy item?
[271:16.99]I mean, the one in the middle, yes.
[271:19.76]The one in the middle, yes.
[271:20.82]Absolutely.
[271:21.26]Because that's just I have permanent damage up, right?
[271:24.30]Take them both.
[271:32.68]Take guppy item.
[271:33.42]It's free anyways.
[271:35.80]Yeah.
[272:02.80]You fucking idiot.
[272:03.54]You just did this.
[272:04.30]Everyone told me to do this.
[272:05.40]This is a smart idea.
[272:06.38]I just got pogged?
[272:16.24]What if I use this?
[272:18.87]No, there's nothing to use it on.
[272:26.45]Oh, this is really great.
[272:30.84]I need to buy some... I need a spirit heart.
[272:33.48]Right now.
[272:35.74]It pogged, you moron.
[272:38.06]Sorry, kid.
[272:42.97]Um, okay.
[272:52.65]You fucked this one up.
[272:57.69]Fuck.
[273:03.99]It ain't over yet.
[273:05.47]It ain't over yet.
[273:09.53]It ain't over yet.
[273:10.05]Come on.
[273:13.80]Spirit heart in one of these.
[273:14.96]Yes!
[273:18.04]Alright, now we use Jera right now.
[273:22.62]It ain't even over.
[273:25.33]We all thought it was over.
[273:28.16]And please have this be Balls of Steel.
[273:30.72]I hate this game.
[273:31.88]No one should play it.
[273:33.70]No one should buy this.
[273:42.12]You should not play this.
[273:48.39]Look at the cards right now.
[273:53.95]I'm looking for balls of steel.
[273:55.81]I'm looking for the... What's the one that gives you... I'm playing it right now.
[274:00.48]Well, if you want my seed, here it is.
[274:07.12]Tears down.
[274:07.76]That's so awful.
[274:08.58]I need tears up.
[274:09.96]Otherwise, this is done-zo.
[274:14.71]Okay.
[274:15.33]This is alright.
[274:25.79]I do have permanent Babylon, whatever it is.
[274:30.51]I have... What is it?
[274:31.53]Horror Babylon, right?
[274:33.13]I have 6.34 damage permanently.
[274:34.75]There's a rock.
[274:38.99]I can't get to it, though.
[274:40.75]I can't get that rock.
[274:41.91]I'm sorry.
[274:42.31]Okay.
[275:00.38]Nice.
[275:00.70]Alright.
[275:00.96]Have it be the... What's it?
[275:05.48]The Hierophant?
[275:09.32]Don't worry.
[275:09.64]He's a gamer god.
[275:10.68]No, it's a magician.
[275:12.52]That card has spawned like four times this run.
[275:18.93]Come on, please.
[275:24.01]Come on.
[275:30.39]Harpen, baby.
[275:31.91]No, I thought you got two spirit hearts for this.
[275:37.69]Keep the card.
[275:38.37]What the fuck?
[275:41.27]Oh, yeah.
[275:42.46]I replaced it with tears down.
[275:44.98]Probably not a great idea.
[275:46.96]Come on.
[275:50.58]No.
[275:51.32]Thank God.
[275:58.86]Again, just use this dialog for watching a baseball game.
[276:10.73]You can just have it be like two balls, three strikes.
[276:14.13]Nothing exciting even happening.
[276:16.81]I expect to see it soon.
[276:18.95]That's -2.
[276:19.79]No, I said sports.
[276:20.91]Sorry.
[276:22.01]I said the word sport.
[276:23.43]I said baseball.
[276:29.91]Okay, this is a card I'm using now.
[276:41.14]Okay, now we just need a shitload of... We need Spirit Hearts.
[276:45.74]What are the chances of getting something like this, like, twice in a row?
[276:57.66]I don't think I've seen... Don't you dare.
[276:59.82]Pick it up.
[277:04.93]It's too much money.
[277:05.83]I can't even spend it.
[277:08.82]I need hearts.
[277:24.78]I need hearts.
[277:25.90]Don't I need the moms?
[277:27.46]Ooh.
[277:36.59]Okay.
[277:39.11]Well, so far.
[277:39.85]Okay.
[277:40.25]This is good.
[277:41.29]Oh yeah.
[277:42.37]Yes.
[277:48.44]What's that?
[277:49.24]Why is that one blinking?
[277:50.00]Why is that one blinking?
[277:59.19]The special art.
[278:00.45]Uh, what on Earth is this?
[278:27.94]99.
[278:27.98]Okay, don't touch any more coins.
[278:29.14]Did I miss any?
[278:34.46]You're a... You dumbass.
[278:36.36]What?
[278:36.58]I don't know what this fucking thing does.
[278:38.58]Okay, I need a shop.
[278:45.57]And it better not be a greed in there.
[278:50.41]Money, money, money is all you need.
[278:51.71]Alright, but I also need to go in the secret room, which is right here.
[278:53.95]Hopefully I get it so I don't get laughed at.
[278:55.43]I'm gonna get laughed at.
[279:12.70]This is a maze.
[279:29.03]Okay.
[279:33.75]He picked up a coin.
[279:34.71]I know, I didn't mean to.
[279:38.44]What do you want from me?
[279:39.08]This is like a million dollars on the ground.
[279:49.01]I missed a poop.
[279:51.97]Whatever.
[279:52.83]Let me just do this first.
[279:53.69]I have a lot of money.
[279:54.41]What's this plug?
[280:06.56]Thank you.
[280:07.16]Okay, what's the plug do?
[280:13.37]Whatever, I'm just getting it.
[280:15.45]Charge with blood.
[280:18.31]It doesn't matter.
[280:19.41]Just get them all.
[280:27.44]Forget about the Bible.
[280:29.50]Just use the Bible right now.
[280:30.50]Does it give you anything?
[280:33.62]Charge every time you get hurt.
[280:34.66]Oh, that's pretty good.
[280:36.78]Just donate money.
[280:37.48]Yeah.
[280:37.80]Okay, donate.
[280:38.88]Donate and then go collect all the money again.
[280:40.60]Hopefully it doesn't trip the thing.
[280:44.40]500?
[280:44.42]What do you get for 500?
[280:45.21]It gives you light?
[280:50.71]Yeah, but I'd rather... Come on.
[280:52.59]Whatever.
[280:58.55]Use the Bible to get to the rock.
[281:03.98]The rock?
[281:05.28]Wait, what rock?
[281:27.33]I just have too much money.
[281:28.09]Alright, where was that rock?
[281:28.97]What the hell is it?
[281:52.66]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[281:57.23]Okay, there it is.
[282:05.29]Can you believe that I've gone to zero hearts twice from having like eight to ten?
[282:12.06]I've done this twice.
[282:13.38]Alright, nothing else I can buy, so let's just go.
[282:30.05]See, I just gotta go.
[282:30.77]I have to leave.
[282:32.03]I feel bad having all that money on the ground and not being able to use it.
[282:50.13]Well, let's kill this.
[283:03.27]Just use baby.
[283:10.70]Ah!
[283:11.14]Good.
[283:19.65]So I have to beat Satan to get the negative, right?
[283:22.91]How that works.
[283:41.78]Talk to chat if you want negativity.
[283:47.48]Not unlocked.
[283:50.16]Well, we're gonna have to keep going.
[283:55.08]That was... that was funny.
[283:59.52]Fight the hush.
[284:03.54]No, I would love to.
[284:04.60]But I don't think this game has enough unlocks yet.
[284:06.74]I want the secret room.
[284:10.34]What is that?
[284:10.68]It was not worth it.
[284:31.67]Die, die, die, die.
[284:35.41]Die, die, die.
[284:36.55]Double key.
[284:39.18]You're not doing good.
[284:41.66]You're doing alright.
[284:53.25]I just burnt those coins.
[284:54.57]I didn't even use them.
[284:57.61]Skip to a room.
[285:11.44]Why are they looking the other way?
[285:18.25]Oh!
[285:18.39]I could have just standed still.
[285:21.47]Standed still?
[285:22.21]Is that a word?
[285:25.15]Could have just stood still.
[285:43.71]Stood still.
[285:44.79]Stood.
[285:45.19]That's right.
[285:45.59]Stood still.
[285:46.27]What do you guys want to play tomorrow?
[285:50.52]Monster Lab for the Wii?
[285:52.40]Sounds like a plan.
[286:02.82]Hulk?
[286:03.92]Nah, Hulk is saved for a special occasion.
[286:07.98]That almost hurt my body doing that.
[286:09.38]Okay.
[286:14.05]Mama Gertie.
[286:18.31]Shit.
[286:19.41]Whatever.
[286:27.26]My fucker.
[286:32.48]Oh, fuck.
[286:33.02]Okay.
[286:33.26]That was not very good.
[286:36.02]Shot speed up.
[286:39.28]Stars.
[286:40.58]Eh.
[286:50.15]Guillermo, watch out for the collectibles.
[286:52.95]Yes!
[286:54.45]Oh, thank God.
[286:56.21]Two of clubs, who cares?
[286:58.61]Finally, I can go into the casino and spend all my money!
[287:06.03]Let's go.
[287:07.05]Doesn't even matter, just spam every machine.
[287:12.19]Where's my hearts?
[287:12.85]Where's my hearts?
[287:16.03]Where are my hearts?
[287:17.29]Where's the fucking hearts?
[287:18.74]Where the hell are the hearts?
[287:21.39]Where are all my hearts?
[287:26.78]What's going on?
[287:27.30]Oh, I just didn't know that happened.
[287:29.32]Okay.
[287:29.60]What the fuck is going on?
[287:30.96]I just almost pooped my pants.
[287:33.56]No!
[287:53.65]Ooh, nice.
[287:54.73]Alright, give me pretty fly.
[287:55.99]There it is.
[287:57.59]I'll take it.
[287:59.01]Yep.
[288:01.13]I still have 79 points.
[288:12.18]This sucked.
[288:14.50]This sucked.
[288:26.43]Ooh. Just get it, right?
[288:31.43]Does it cover the bottom one first? Well, they're all bottom ones. All of them are bottom ones first.
[288:38.43]Okay I have to get this to where I fight mom.
[288:43.43]I'm not gonna take this. Yeah, not yet.
[288:56.85]If you don't get it, you'll ruin Babylon.
[288:59.67]Oh, that's right.
[289:01.75]That is a very good point.
[289:09.36]You couldn't hit it.
[289:09.96]Dude, why'd you get rid of the poop thing?
[289:23.38]I know.
[289:23.64]You don't have to remind me.
[289:26.84]So what are we thinking, Monster Lab for the Wii tomorrow?
[289:28.42]I think so.
[289:35.44]No, no, I'm up.
[289:36.60]Look, I can't play Hope tomorrow.
[289:39.04]Why, why, why?
[289:40.18]Because I didn't buy it yet.
[289:42.53]Okay.
[289:42.81]I'm going to be honest with you.
[289:44.33]I'm not going to lie to you guys.
[289:48.43]If I start lying to you guys, you guys will just make fucking screen names that say that I lied about shit.
[290:14.85]This is not actually too bad.
[290:16.07]This is pretty good, actually.
[290:17.57]Alright.
[290:27.05]Take a room really doesn't matter.
[290:29.67]If you don't, if there's no more, no.
[290:32.74]Doesn't this just do Whore Babylon?
[290:41.29]Where's this rock?
[290:44.37]Rock?
[290:45.13]Where?
[290:50.75]Where the hell did you even see that?
[290:56.21]Alright, here we go.
[291:35.11]Come on, really?
[291:35.71]I don't have, I'm not seeing enough damage.
[291:43.30]I'm not seeing enough damage.
[291:50.08]Wait, can I do this again?
[291:50.78]No, wait, what is that?
[291:53.18]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[291:54.52]Alright, what should I do?
[291:59.52]What do I have?
[292:00.06]What do I have to do?
[292:04.08]Should I try to just kill Satan?
[292:08.64]Down, Satan, down, down, you fool.
[292:10.46]Should've gotten it.
[292:11.72]No.
[292:13.20]I'm down.
[292:14.38]I gotta get my revenge.
[292:20.04]That's not a whole lot of hearts.
[292:24.80]What the fuck?
[292:27.74]Hide back here.
[292:30.38]Jesus.
[292:36.71]Never scream if you see a titted rock.
[292:38.51]I really need to know.
[292:41.73]This is a really bad place to fight this guy.
[293:05.74]Get the fuck away from me.

[293:35.48]Holy shit, I almost got hit.
[293:37.06]Okay, where is it?
[293:38.98]Do I want that secret room?
[293:41.88]No, I don't.
[293:42.34]Yeah, I do.
[293:43.86]Could be something cool.
[293:49.19]This is way too many rooms.
[293:51.05]So, why would I do this?
[293:52.03]Okay.
[294:18.21]um okay please don't do that again I like one more bomb 91 coins good thing I have all these coins

[295:04.05]Does that really work?
[295:05.43]I should try it.
[295:08.31]I can't believe I got fucking hit by that.
[295:09.65]I was too busy looking at chat to look at the guy that said that to laugh.
[295:26.70]One bomb, this sucks.
[295:32.48]And I can't even get it if I want it.
[295:34.85]I can't even bomb them.
[295:46.04]Okay, we still got one more.

[297:38.28]Who do I want to do this with?
[297:46.57]Samson.
[297:52.87]Okay, so it just appears randomly or what?
[297:58.54]Nice.
[297:59.06]Good start.
[298:08.96]Do I have to beat it in a certain amount of time or is it just going to show up now?
[298:20.08]Just go.
[298:20.72]That's too much to do.
[298:21.52]I'm going to take the hit here.
[298:28.83]Yep.
[298:29.19]Good idea.
[298:29.95]Good call.
[298:30.53]Fast.
[298:30.89]Hurry.
[298:35.49]Those of you that don't know, every time Samson takes a hit, you gain more damage and it lasts until the next floor.
[298:42.53]He's so good.
[298:53.40]Good start.
[298:53.76]Come on, item.
[298:54.94]Is it Chili Pepper?
[298:57.04]Bird's Eye.
[298:57.86]It burns.
[299:03.94]Bird's Eye...
[299:04.99]Wait, what?
[299:06.87]Was it randomly doing that?
[299:11.24]Whoa.
[299:12.32]Does this hurt me?
[299:12.80]That's actually... Okay, that's really cool.
[299:17.44]I need luck.
[299:18.16]Give me a shitload of luck with this.
[299:19.28]That's really cool.
[299:21.80]Alright.
[299:25.92]Alright, I'll take the hit.
[299:27.74]That does so much fucking damage.
[299:29.32]I want the damage.
[299:30.30]Speedrun, guys.
[299:31.72]Kill the boss.
[299:32.72]Let's go.
[299:35.32]Light it open.
[299:47.59]Fuck.
[299:48.61]What the hell is that?
[299:50.31]Is that it?
[299:53.13]How do I go in there?
[299:56.51]Does it just open?
[299:57.54]Do I need a key?
[300:00.88]Shit, I need a key?
[300:01.68]Does it stay?
[300:05.73]Alright, give me a key.
[300:10.29]I got two more rooms to look in.
[300:12.41]No, nothing in here.
[300:13.33]Great.
[300:15.03]One more chance for a key.
[300:20.98]I can't blow that rock up.
[300:22.02]I know it's there.
[300:23.88]Sorry.
[300:27.40]Whatever.
[300:28.24]Reset?
[300:28.72]No, no.
[300:29.14]These fire tears are cool.
[300:32.15]Wait, does it disappear forever?
[300:33.83]Or will it show up in the next...
[300:40.49]Oh, no, wait, is it only going to show up once?
[300:42.71]It will be on the next floor, too.
[300:44.36]Oh, yeah, that's fine.
[300:46.72]Yeah, let's go.
[300:48.04]It'll show up again.
[300:48.70]Yeah, alright, let's go.
[300:59.59]First of the unknown.
[301:00.79]I didn't do anything.
[301:18.56]How do I get smaller?
[301:19.18]Is it based on how much damage you have?
[301:21.90]That's kind of cool, actually.
[301:22.86]If that's what it is, that's really... No, it's not.
[301:31.34]Look at this broken code.
[301:32.75]What the hell happened here?
[301:57.78]Save the key.
[301:58.26]I don't want to use it.
[302:04.63]Missed a rock?
[302:06.55]Well, I... Well... Alright.
[302:14.33]It's not worth blowing this up to get in there.
[302:17.13]Alright, yes it is.
[302:18.27]Meh.
[302:29.25]Not necessarily.
[302:40.72]For a second, I thought the fire attacked me.
[302:42.16]I was like, why is this an Antibirth?
[302:43.85]Why is it coming out of the flame?
[302:45.51]Why is it coming out of the campfire thing?
[302:58.89]This game really is just so much fun.
[303:07.87]You guys want to see Isaac again?
[303:09.04]You want to play Isaac, like, I don't know, like, once every week or two or something?
[303:18.40]I'd play it, like, once in a while.
[303:20.72]For a little while.
[303:22.82]Just, like, nothing going on.
[303:25.60]But there's like nothing to do and I'm just like, you know what, let's just move to, let's pivot to Isaac.
[303:29.20]That's probably what's gonna happen.
[303:32.80]Alright, I'll take that.
[303:37.46]Uh, this is technology.
[303:39.76]Yep.
[303:44.30]Technology is so good.
[303:48.12]Wait, there's a good one and there's a bad one.
[303:50.38]There's like technology, there's technology too.
[303:52.84]Which one's the bad one?
[303:58.61]Tech 2 is the bad one.
[303:59.85]Okay.
[304:01.15]I would love to go in one of these, but I don't.
[304:03.17]I can't.
[304:05.69]Yeah, I guess one goes through people.
[304:06.70]Does the other one go through people too?
[304:07.60]Looks like it just sucked on somebody.
[304:11.96]Okay, I have to keep this key, so let's just go.
[304:25.28]Go to the monster.
[304:25.90]Oh, he's easy.
[304:37.16]Oh!
[304:37.72]I have an update for you guys about something.
[304:41.06]So, the Boston Marathon got canceled.
[304:45.06]And those of you that know, I was gonna do a charity stream to sponsor one of my friends to run in the marathon.
[304:58.69]So everything's getting moved.
[305:04.64]So that's not... They're pushing that, I think, to later in the summer, I think.
[305:08.48]I have no idea.
[305:09.32]They're still not 100% clear on exactly what's happening.
[305:16.18]But...
[305:17.87]That rumble stream might not be in the next, like, couple weeks.
[305:22.93]We were also thinking that maybe we would raise money first and then hold on to it until it was ready to be used.
[305:27.99]We're trying to figure out what to do.
[305:28.99]Because we started planning a bunch of stuff around it.
[305:34.71]All stats up.
[305:35.39]Nice.
[305:35.95]Perfect.
[305:38.89]Just hold on to it.
[305:39.77]That's kind of the idea.
[305:40.72]We're just trying to figure out exactly what we want to do.
[305:46.14]One heart for a quarter?
[305:47.08]No.
[305:48.92]I'll take both these.
[305:49.70]I'm so mad.
[305:56.33]Alright.
[305:57.05]Okay.
[305:57.51]Bye.
[306:06.93]Alright.
[306:07.25]We're fine.
[306:10.45]Take the cloak?
[306:12.03]The robe?
[306:13.57]No.
[306:13.77]I don't have enough.
[306:15.33]No, no, no, no, no.
[306:16.79]I don't want it.
[306:17.87]Jesus, the robes.
[306:18.65]No, the robes.
[306:19.17]There's too many hearts.
[306:20.19]Too many hearts to do right now.
[306:25.43]These buckets.
[306:26.01]Alright, cool.
[306:30.58]Here we go.
[306:36.74]Antibirth.
[306:37.32]Downpour 2.
[306:38.24]He gives 3 black hearts, but you know I'm going to lose those.
[306:45.42]Alright, we got all new enemies, I think.
[306:49.19]Is it a mirror or is that... Sorry, hit me, hit me, hit me.
[307:00.79]I want the damage.
[307:01.21]Alright.
[307:13.54]Holy shit, what are these?
[307:17.96]Whoa.
[307:18.14]Are they flashy or something?
[307:21.83]This is pretty cool.
[307:25.81]Um, which one?
[307:28.51]I don't know what these... What do these ones do?
[307:30.55]What do they do?
[307:37.85]Is that lemonade?
[307:40.17]In there, what's the pee-pee one?
[307:41.65]Was it one that you go, like, you pee-pee all over the ground right in front of you?
[307:49.54]Is it this one here?
[307:50.66]Hold on.
[307:54.14]I want to see what they do.
[307:54.86]Just take it.
[307:59.27]Take left.
[307:59.95]Take left.
[308:01.13]Just take left.
[308:01.69]Alright.
[308:12.25]That's a lot of... This is going to be pretty good.
[308:15.04]This is going to be very good.
[308:24.82]Look at his face.
[308:25.44]Look, he's so happy.
[308:32.27]Look at that DPS that's gonna... Bikes in the ground?
[308:38.15]Collectibles.
[308:42.81]I don't have enough money to do anything here.
[308:44.13]Let's just move.
[308:49.93]Okay, good.
[308:52.14]What the fuck?
[308:53.62]Hey!
[308:57.26]Speed up.
[309:00.58]Tinted rock.
[309:02.40]Hold on to your bombs.
[309:07.48]Oh!
[309:09.20]Ah!
[309:16.78]How would I blow these up?
[309:20.83]How would I release these?
[309:25.42]Just aim down here.
[309:26.80]Don't even move.
[309:32.95]Let them walk into it.
[309:42.66]Um, okay.
[309:45.04]Lot of shit in there.
[309:49.60]What's raining?
[309:50.26]Is it raining?
[309:53.34]Oh, when you kill them, they explode.
[309:55.12]Okay, I see.
[309:58.39]It was.
[309:59.07]Passage.
[310:01.51]Alright, I'm looking for a ladder, right?
[310:04.89]Nope.
[310:07.27]Rock.
[310:13.64]Rock?
[310:13.90]Tent?
[310:14.90]Where?
[310:15.14]I don't see one.
[310:19.62]There it is.
[310:31.26]This technology combo is fucking crazy.
[310:33.72]Alright, I think I'm good.
[310:34.74]I need two bombs.
[310:41.45]I got two bombs.
[310:42.37]Save two bombs.
[310:53.71]What is in here?
[310:58.17]What's that indicator?
[311:00.31]On the mini-map.
[311:00.75]What does that mean?
[311:01.39]What's in here?
[311:08.93]This?
[311:10.53]It's a secret.
[311:11.35]Oh.
[311:12.93]Oh, if I bomb that, I get to... Alright, well, I don't want to... It's an invisible chest.
[311:21.98]When the lightning flashes, you'll see it.
[311:25.96]Pretty cool.
[311:26.62]Oh, shit.
[311:27.36]Alright, how do I get it?
[311:30.32]Alright, if I find another bomb.
[311:31.80]Let's go find one.
[311:35.40]This actually is really cool.
[311:42.00]This is a cool addition.
[311:42.76]How many new areas are actually in any board?
[311:45.44]I don't even remember playing this.
[311:47.06]Maybe like once.
[311:47.74]Alright.
[311:59.09]No, it's not worth opening that.
[312:01.48]four oh that's cool no bombs oh well keep the hoof yeah isn't the cartridge doesn't randomly make you um run around with the glowing face and you can not get hurt like hackman style thing
[312:38.12]Pain Rainmaker.
[312:46.64]You don't stand a fucking chance.
[312:49.54]We just got instantly killed.
[312:52.51]That was a cool boss.
[312:53.57]It's too bad we didn't even see it.
[312:54.61]Alright, two bombs.
[313:01.49]We go deeper.
[313:10.22]This is a mod.
[313:10.68]This is a mod.
[313:11.30]This is the Antibirth mod.
[313:13.91]And you will be pleased to know that the Antibirth mod is going to become an official DLC to the game very soon in the next few months.
[313:23.93]Didn't know.
[313:31.55]Am I shooting more?
[313:32.65]I'm shooting faster.
[313:33.41]Why?
[313:33.61]Am I crazy or is this faster?
[313:41.07]No?
[313:41.35]Am I losing my mind?
[313:41.99]Whoa!
[313:51.02]What's that?
[313:51.62]Why is it- Why are we not opening the door?
[314:00.62]Why is this a spider watching me?
[314:03.19]I didn't see that.
[314:08.64]Oh shit!
[314:09.58]Okay, be careful.
[314:13.14]That's a cool enemy.
[314:20.59]Alright, I know that thing sucks, but I don't even know what this is.
[314:30.02]Knockout drops.
[314:30.90]They pack a punch.
[314:44.94]What is this?
[314:46.14]Doesn't work with technology?
[314:47.50]Oh.
[314:48.86]That's sad.
[314:50.02]Yes, it does.
[314:52.14]It sure does.
[314:53.78]Oh, look, they're in Donkey Kong cards.
[314:59.45]Alright, I gotta stop paying attention to the cool stuff and play.
[315:06.87]Punch lasers.
[315:07.81]Yeah, this is awesome.
[315:12.11]Little gold nuggets.
[315:15.62]Oh, shit.
[315:20.22]I'm assuming they become hazards.
[315:21.26]Yeah.
[315:32.90]That punch is so dumb.
[315:36.59]Actually, very useful, though.
[315:37.81]Give me another hit.
[315:39.91]I'll take another one.
[315:42.87]Good.
[315:43.23]Okay.
[315:45.94]11.16 damage every quarter second this is insane oh yeah the little minecarts are great and it does concussion damage too that's fantastic that's crazy
[316:15.35]Did I use the coin?
[316:16.67]Pick up the penny.
[316:17.27]Pick up that penny.
[316:17.93]Yeah, I guess that is pretty good with Samson.
[316:22.96]But I don't know how slow I am.
[316:26.28]Actually, it's completely negligible.
[316:28.50]What am I talking about?
[316:29.18]Look at these hams.
[316:37.85]I don't want to go on the boss yet.
[316:38.83]I want to keep looking.
[316:52.26]Oh, whatever.
[317:06.25]I need soul hearts?
[317:08.84]Uh... I don't have any.
[317:17.82]Painted rock.
[317:28.65]Two soul hearts.
[317:30.87]Oh!
[317:31.29]Hey!
[317:31.97]I thought that was the... Shit.
[317:34.51]I only have one.
[317:36.21]I need two?
[317:45.22]It worked.
[317:45.82]Yeah, it did work.
[317:46.74]I thought that was the damage rock thing.
[317:50.60]Should I open up... Should I buy one?
[317:53.32]I think I'm gonna try to buy... I'm gonna buy one.
[317:58.26]If it's available.
[318:01.27]Not available.
[318:02.77]Oh, well.
[318:03.99]That's kind of sad.
[318:09.89]Just don't get hit.
[318:10.97]Do it after the boss.
[318:13.60]You need it on the next floor, not on this one.
[318:15.56]Oh, okay.
[318:19.14]Just don't get hit.
[318:20.14]I see.
[318:23.38]Bomb the donation thing?
[318:25.02]Okay, yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[318:26.15]I don't have any bombs.
[318:30.79]Donate four coins, please.
[318:32.67]Okay, fine.
[318:36.71]500!
[318:36.85]Alright.
[318:37.25]Let's see what it is.
[318:51.06]How am I not going to get hit by a boss I've never seen?
[318:52.62]Great Gideon.
[318:58.32]What's with this health bar?
[319:10.96]Ooh, I got hit.
[319:12.68]I got hit.
[319:15.06]I can't damage him.
[319:16.26]Just kill the enemies?
[319:18.90]I guess that's what you do.
[319:29.79]Watch these fires, I'll step on one.
[319:39.96]Why is that frozen?
[319:41.98]Hams.
[319:43.62]Fuck.
[319:51.42]Oy.
[319:55.22]Is that it?
[320:09.47]Okay.
[320:11.99]Um... Here's up.
[320:20.51]I can't go any further than that.
[320:22.63]I'm at the top of the... I don't think I can get any more spirit hearts unless there's, uh... Let's get huge bits.
[320:33.38]5,000 bits from Vilemi.
[320:34.08]$50. $50.
[320:39.17]Need tier delay, yeah.
[320:41.15]Thanks for the $50, Vilemi.
[320:44.31]Thank you for donating 500 bits to the shop, Jeremy.
[320:46.79]We appreciate your support.
[320:51.60]Well, thanks for giving me 5,000 bits.
[320:54.04]Thanks for the $50.
[320:54.66]That's a lot of fucking money.
[320:56.96]Alright, Spirit Heart's up at this floor.
[321:00.18]Okay, I'll keep that in mind.
[321:03.21]Alright, Hierophant.
[321:05.15]Let's get lucky right here, Hierophant.
[321:08.77]Nope.
[321:13.11]That would just save the... Envy.
[321:25.54]That kinda hurt my eyes.
[321:28.73]This is not what I need.
[321:43.55]I can even see tinted rocks.
[321:55.28]Please explain everything.
[322:00.28]Uh... Was there a rock?
[322:12.08]Oh...
[322:16.35]Alright, I'm good.
[322:18.37]I need bombs.
[322:19.29]Yeah, I need a lot more than that.
[322:29.00]Come on.
[322:29.40]Spirit hearts.
[322:30.06]Bombs.
[322:30.32]There you go.
[322:30.74]Get a bomb.
[322:40.23]Oh, what?
[322:41.15]He turned us... I just lost all the gains I just got.
[322:45.67]That's a... Alright.
[322:46.51]No?
[322:48.44]Don't get the hearts till you beat the boss.
[322:49.92]Yeah, I know.
[322:50.64]I know.
[322:50.94]I know.
[322:51.30]I know.
[322:51.68]Still need to get spirit hearts.
[323:13.57]Skip leg day.
[323:15.15]What the fuck?
[323:16.13]Alright, I'm gonna die down here.
[323:18.87]I'm not careful.
[323:21.00]I need health.
[323:21.70]Not just spirit arms.
[323:22.50]I need health.
[323:31.98]Does this work with technology?
[323:33.10]This is shielded tears, isn't it?
[323:34.30]This should block everything.
[323:45.59]Okay, so there's a rock.
[323:50.07]Where is it?
[323:50.49]Oh.
[323:57.86]Okay, well, let's... Shit.
[324:08.61]Those things are cool.
[324:09.25]Alright, we're looking for... We want to just make it so we can... Press the buttons?
[324:14.21]How am I...
[324:17.13]What did that do?
[324:21.31]What did that do?
[324:27.43]You failed.
[324:28.05]You failed the puzzle.
[324:32.00]I just saw a button, so I stepped on it.
[324:39.14]Oh.
[324:40.08]Look at the pebbles.
[324:46.60]I- wha- I did- what?
[324:51.02]Oh well.
[324:51.80]Damn it.
[324:52.52]It's okay.
[324:52.98]Alright, there's a spirit heart here.
[324:55.86]Too bad there's not an actual heart.
[324:59.32]Alright, there's one here.
[325:01.38]And there's a rock.
[325:01.96]Where's that tinted rock?
[325:02.88]Is there a rock in here too?
[325:03.78]I haven't peed in like five and a half hours.
[325:06.69]Alright, where is it?
[325:14.49]In here?
[325:20.71]There it is.

[326:44.27]Alright.
[326:44.59]Parts.
[326:54.82]I don't see any in here.
[327:15.27]I can't even blow it up.
[327:16.35]I can't blow it.
[327:17.57]I don't have any bombs.
[327:19.43]Is there bombs in the store?
[327:20.47]I don't think there was.
[327:23.48]Fuck, I only have three and a half hearts.
[327:28.90]Bomb in the shop.
[327:30.10]Okay, bomb in the shop.
[327:38.70]And then I need... Is it tinted rock?
[327:44.94]Where was it?

[328:11.95]It's not gonna hit it from here.
[328:14.41]Oh, is it?
[328:14.93]I don't think it is.
[328:19.05]Will it?
[328:19.41]Oh, no!
[328:26.27]Come on!
[328:28.53]That sucks.
[328:31.06]It's the only one that didn't get hit.
[328:38.19]Well, let's hope I can kill this boss.
[328:40.71]Without being terrible.
[328:41.91]Okay.
[328:46.51]Here we go.
[328:52.95]Puff Twins.
[328:57.54]What?
[328:59.01]Do I have to activate the bomb?
[329:00.05]Do I have to touch a bomb?
[329:01.95]Activate the bomb.
[329:03.63]Do I have to run into the bomb?
[329:05.57]I touch bomb.
[329:06.37]Okay, I got a bomb.
[329:09.07]I get it.
[329:12.66]For some reason, it was red.
[329:13.54]I thought it was going to kill me.
[329:15.56]Okay, cool.
[329:21.29]Oh, what the fuck just happened?
[329:23.37]What just happened?
[329:24.79]What?
[329:28.14]What just happened?
[329:42.03]Wait, is he free?
[329:43.77]He's free.
[329:44.05]Alright, he's free.
[329:45.87]Get the fuck away from me.
[329:46.81]Alright, I gotta break the rest of his head.
[329:51.87]Get down here.
[329:55.01]Didn't time it right.
[330:31.94]That sound.
[330:33.60]Yes!
[330:35.34]Okay.
[330:38.61]I can't even get the fucking item.
[330:40.01]Yes, I can.
[330:45.31]Ah!
[330:49.73]Well, good thing it's little Steven.
[330:52.93]I need two spirit hearts.
[330:53.95]Go get them.
[330:58.55]Wait, why can't I go down?
[331:00.49]What's down?
[331:05.01]Good thing I saw the door on the right, because I was going to get the spirit hearts and go down the fucking well.
[331:16.84]Alright, let's go.
[331:19.84]That's the normal route.
[331:21.12]Oh, okay.
[331:27.27]Let's go.
[331:33.29]I don't have any bombs to blow these up, but let's go in.
[331:35.83]Okay.
[331:45.21]Mausoleum 1.
[331:46.05]Alright, I guess stay alive.
[331:50.21]Do I need any special items for this?
[331:55.03]Or does it just go?
[331:59.76]Holy fuck.
[332:01.70]Oh my god.
[332:02.76]It's nuts.
[332:04.86]Don't do that again.
[332:05.56]Turn the music up?
[332:13.33]There.
[332:23.87]What's the moons mean?
[332:25.23]Symbols?
[332:25.59]Should I step on them?
[332:26.29]What do they mean?
[332:34.59]Alright, got it.
[332:36.96]You just ruined it for me.
[333:07.47]I'm sorry.
[333:08.65]I'm sorry.
[333:11.93]What's wrong?
[333:12.75]That's a good song.
[333:13.25]That's a quality song.
[333:37.75]I need hearts.
[333:39.43]Now or else.
[333:40.97]Who's the last?
[333:41.47]Don't even spoil it.
[333:44.12]Who's the last boss of Antipers?
[333:48.62]Brock, go back.
[333:49.28]I don't even know how you guys see this shit.
[333:52.02]You guys are so good at everything.
[333:54.54]How?
[333:55.14]Like, where?
[333:55.74]How can you pay that much attention?
[333:57.75]On the right side?
[334:05.95]How would you even see this shit?
[334:07.59]I don't even know how you do that.
[334:11.80]Not only that, you're at a lower bitrate than me.
[334:14.40]You're seeing this at 6,000 up.
[334:16.76]I'm seeing this at, like, 500,000.
[334:17.66]Perfect score.
[334:18.50]Um...
[334:34.47]Let me check something real quick.
[334:35.38]Okay.
[334:35.90]For a second, I thought my microphone was delayed by like two seconds.
[334:38.40]The whole stream.
[334:39.14]Because I played the Wii shit before.
[334:41.66]Come on, Stevie.
[334:54.55]Your mic is muted.
[334:55.45]Fuck!
[334:56.29]Is it?
[334:58.74]That's my first day streaming.
[335:05.20]Pretty good combo.
[335:06.62]Ooh, diamonds.
[335:08.04]Money.
[335:09.43]Well, I know it's here.
[335:11.11]If I need money, I'll come back.
[335:14.91]Huh.
[335:16.47]Well, that's one of the worms.
[335:20.05]Does that do anything to my laser beam?
[335:25.44]Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock.
[335:27.78]I see this one.
[335:31.70]Hell fucking yeah.
[335:35.56]Up to 8.4 damage per tick.
[335:38.80]That's per tick.
[335:39.73]That's not per second.
[335:40.55]That's per tick.
[335:41.61]8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4
[336:11.04]Your mic compression is so bad.
[336:12.32]I don't even have compression on.
[336:13.32]I don't even have it turned on.
[336:15.32]I don't have compression on.
[336:19.26]It literally is not even activated.
[336:35.89]You want me to prove it?
[336:42.51]Hey, hey, how are you?
[336:43.43]How are you doing?
[336:44.01]How are you doing?
[336:46.65]See, what would have happened there if there was compression on?
[336:49.81]The whispering would have been really loud.
[336:51.85]And the screaming would have been dropped way, way lower.
[336:54.21]So, here you go.
[336:58.32]Why is there poo on the floor?
[336:59.44]This is a dirty game.
[337:03.74]That's literally what happened.
[337:04.80]No, it's not.
[337:06.86]Let me show this to you.
[337:09.04]It will now.
[337:12.08]Okay, so as you see here, this is with compression on.
[337:16.96]Notice what's happening.
[337:18.00]What's happening?
[337:20.32]And then now we're turning on the... See?
[337:23.18]This is what happens when compression is on.
[337:27.91]Now it's off.
[337:31.99]Here we go.
[337:32.47]It's off.
[337:43.50]You just don't have fucking audio engineer ears like I do.
[337:48.36]I'm an audio engineer, are you?
[337:49.96]This place is really cool.
[338:13.34]The whispering was as loud as the yelling was.
[338:15.48]Welcome to compression 102.
[338:17.18]Because you should have learned that in the fucking first year of classes.
[338:21.66]Dude.
[338:25.38]Oh shit.
[338:33.57]Your fly is down?
[338:34.51]Oh shit.
[338:35.57]Whoa.
[338:48.09]I was gonna go for it, but nah, it wasn't even worth it.
[338:50.59]Why aren't you using 20 to 1?
[338:55.05]Hold on.
[338:55.61]I've got no fucking idea what this room is.
[339:02.46]I just got annihilated in here.
[339:04.68]Come here, what the fuck?
[339:23.42]Don't get hit by this guy.
[339:24.67]That would be so embarrassing.
[339:25.79]An audio engineer would never get hit by that.
[339:35.21]Judgment.
[339:36.81]Give me something good.
[339:45.68]Yes!
[339:46.80]Yes, that's the best thing I could have possibly picked up.
[340:03.31]Please continue to make this keep happening.
[340:05.92]Please make this happen.
[340:06.96]And lunch.
[340:08.10]Give me your lunch.
[340:09.30]Thank you.
[340:12.24]Now I have a full heal.
[340:14.50]I'm good to go.
[340:17.44]Move diamonds.
[340:18.16]Pay hands.
[340:18.62]Ah, shit, you're right.
[340:19.33]It's okay.
[340:22.41]I had plenty of money.
[340:25.49]Uh, it's a relic, right?
[340:34.20]Soul generator?
[340:35.16]Yeah.
[340:36.96]Nice.
[340:38.48]Open this door.
[340:40.86]Anything in here that I want?
[340:41.64]I got 15 coins.
[340:42.22]That's the exact amount that I'm looking for.
[340:43.82]Do I get the treasure map?
[340:45.56]Just for fun?
[340:46.42]Why would I do that?
[340:51.65]No, this is not the treasure map.
[340:52.63]This is the full map.
[340:53.49]What's going on over there on the other side?
[340:54.81]What is over there?
[340:58.27]How do I get over there?
[340:59.09]Teleporting thing up there?
[341:09.82]How do I turn it on?
[341:10.72]It was off when I tried to do it before.
[341:18.33]I don't know.
[341:24.55]Yes!
[341:27.21]Why is Nightbot telling me that the stream is not on?
[341:39.59]Well, I want to explore a little more.
[341:40.71]I don't want to just end it.
[341:41.87]Is this the last zone?
[341:44.81]Well, the last boss?
[341:52.44]Check the map.
[341:53.74]Yeah, but... What is this?
[341:55.84]Spring.
[341:56.40]Oh, shit.
[341:57.50]Okay.
[342:00.77]RIP screen.
[342:01.61]Jeremy, you're late.
[342:02.71]What are you talking about?
[342:08.40]Well, this room was a disaster, but I only took one hit.
[342:11.39]Okay, so hold on.
[342:13.73]Wait.
[342:20.97]Did I just fight the boss?
[342:27.02]I kind of want to see what this teleporter thing does.
[342:29.30]I can't get up there, I don't think, though.
[342:40.32]Do I have to blow my way up there?
[342:41.52]I don't think I have enough to do it.
[342:48.81]No, definitely not.
[342:59.32]No.
[342:59.48]No, no, no.
[343:03.92]Riot?
[343:06.40]Bomb rock.
[343:12.96]Oh my goodness.
[343:16.26]Is there a bomb in the shop?
[343:17.40]Because if there is, how much is it?
[343:19.54]And I got the diamonds.
[343:21.32]I got the two of diamonds.
[343:26.41]Let's go.
[343:26.93]I'm going to get it.
[343:28.19]Let's get up there.

[344:12.52]Where do I get hurt?
[344:13.56]How do I hurt myself?
[344:15.76]Is there a spike?
[344:16.93]I don't think there's any spikes anywhere.
[344:21.61]Stand in the fire?
[344:22.73]The shop.
[344:24.33]Right.
[344:29.85]This is gonna work out.
[344:30.97]We're gonna do the secret entrance.
[344:34.57]There's no fire.
[344:35.43]Oh, I sprayed him.
[344:36.41]I sprayed him out.
[344:37.71]I sprayed him.
[344:39.15]Are there any more fires?
[344:40.09]I just instinctively spray every fire.
[344:43.39]All of them.
[344:43.73]You've seen me do it.
[344:44.67]I do all of them.
[344:51.19]I sprayed him.
[344:52.25]Is there any more fire?
[344:58.69]Child's proof floor.
[345:01.97]Purple.
[345:06.68]Ah, fuck, I can't do that.
[345:13.33]Hmm... Get hit by the boss?
[345:21.05]Does... I can just get hit by the boss.
[345:23.09]Yeah, but, I mean, does that... Can I come back out here?
[345:33.14]Oh, so this is not the end, then.
[345:34.82]I can come back out here.
[345:35.67]Alright, well, give me strength.
[345:37.65]Let's go.
[345:41.57]Wait, two diamonds and a sun.
[345:42.87]No, where's strength?
[345:51.40]Here we go.
[345:53.94]The Fallen.
[345:56.12]Fallen?! !
[346:02.09]Holy shit, why is the... What's the Fallen doing down here?
[346:06.33]I didn't get hit!
[346:07.58]Fuck!
[346:08.56]It was so fast!
[346:10.24]No!
[346:13.08]Shit!
[346:13.92]It was so quick!
[346:15.30]I was so taken aback that I instantly killed him!
[346:17.86]I was so taken aback that I... He died!

[348:16.45]Oh, no!
[348:16.75]Alright, so...
[348:27.30]I know that was a... I know that's -2.
[348:29.07]I did it on purpose.
[348:31.99]Let's go?
[348:34.09]Oh, shit.
[348:34.73]I thought you had a bomb.
[348:35.71]Oh, they're connected.
[348:43.09]They're connected by this guy.
[348:52.09]So this is the real final floor then, because that one was going to take you back to the normal game, right?
[348:58.62]Do I have to correct?
[349:02.40]Nice.
[349:26.99]I'm at max damage though now.
[349:30.99]2130 a tick.
[349:31.45]This is crazy.
[349:34.61]Don't put the fires out.
[349:40.00]Now I bomb this fire.
[349:52.18]Well, that's what we call perfect.
[350:16.65]Is he?
[350:17.01]Alright.
[350:19.87]Another shop?
[350:20.69]Should I buy some bombs or something?
[350:24.38]What should I do?
[350:26.14]Spatter?
[350:31.28]Donate.
[350:34.64]Never even got an active item.
[350:36.06]Yeah, that's true.
[350:36.56]I didn't get anything.
[350:38.02]Buy a bomb.
[350:38.68]So this is it.
[350:48.02]Donate the rest of the money.
[350:49.46]No donations.
[350:50.20]Sad.
[350:53.18]There.
[350:59.93]That's all that's over here, huh?
[351:00.79]Okay, well that was kinda cool.
[351:06.37]There's another floor.
[351:07.17]Oh, that was fun.
[351:18.29]So, correct me if I'm wrong, I just go down this floor, down into the thing, right?
[351:22.37]It's not like, oh, no, don't go, don't go down!
[351:24.28]Get the worm?
[351:30.46]That's right, I do have bombs now, you're right.
[351:35.59]Worm is not gonna work?
[351:37.61]Worm doesn't do anything.
[351:38.73]Okay.
[351:39.35]Rock?
[351:39.99]Fuck!
[351:41.15]I'm overwhelmed, okay.
[351:42.25]I'm just gonna go.
[351:43.13]What just happened?
[351:46.43]What happened?
[351:46.75]Hello?
[351:46.97]What happened to the game?
[351:48.13]What happened to the game?
[351:58.95]Continue, right?
[351:59.65]It's crashed.
[352:00.25]Continue?
[352:01.16]Continue.
[352:05.52]Please.
[352:13.72]What the fuck is this?
[352:20.34]Mausoleum 1?
[352:26.16]Is it going to be the exact same thing?
[352:28.30]I'm so confused.
[352:29.18]Wait, I have to do everything again?
[352:30.42]Why did I just get, like, banned?
[352:38.37]Oh, I don't know what just happened, but I got to do it again.
[352:40.51]That wasn't that bad.
[352:42.09]Maybe I had to fall in, and I was like, oh, I killed him with one hit.
[352:44.03]Okay, whatever.
[352:44.49]Let's go, quickly.
[352:48.44]Is there anything else I need to remember here?
[352:50.13]If it was the sun card, I'd just do it all again.
[352:54.19]At least the run isn't over yet.
[352:56.17]That would have been really disappointing.
[352:57.31]That would have been really annoying.
[353:00.40]Alright, I'll get, like, just coffee here.
[353:06.14]I can die very easily.
[353:09.14]That goes on my health, too.
[353:17.76]I thought it crashed again, but that was me.
[353:19.92]Okay, let's go.
[353:33.30]Rock, top right.
[353:33.96]I don't remember where any of them are.
[353:39.76]Right, okay, yeah, right here.
[353:45.25]Did we get a better outcome this time?
[353:46.39]I think we just got a better outcome.
[353:50.03]Weird, okay.
[353:51.33]Keep track of those rocks.
[353:57.82]This time use the diamond card, yeah.
[354:14.77]This is RNG manipulation.
[354:16.39]That's actually going to be kind of a big deal, though.
[354:18.93]Is that possible?
[354:19.57]That we'll get something, different items?
[354:21.35]No, it's the same seed, right?
[354:33.34]What just hit me?
[354:34.24]What just happened?
[354:36.28]What hit me?
[354:38.97]How did I get sniped?
[354:41.39]A fucking bone hit me?
[354:42.81]I'm aggravated by that one.
[354:48.62]Alright, here is two diamonds.
[354:50.02]Don't use it yet.
[354:52.82]Okay, remember this part.
[354:53.69]There's a... Rock!
[354:59.81]There it is.
[355:00.19]I freaked out about this.
[355:00.97]I was like, holy shit, nice.
[355:01.95]Can't do that.
[355:06.50]Okay, remember, I was like, oh, I'm gonna get that.
[355:11.56]I'll come back and get the diamond thing.
[355:25.67]Redo the joke?
[355:26.37]What joke?
[355:26.77]Didn't tell him.
[355:37.02]Come on.
[355:37.50]When do you die?
[355:43.00]Not... Oh, yeah.
[355:43.73]This is... Wait.
[355:45.61]We have prior knowledge.
[355:46.51]What is this?
[356:01.52]I got hit by the same enemy in that one.
[356:05.95]Okay, so hold on.
[356:07.39]Make sure I get enough money, right?
[356:10.05]14.
[356:10.67]There's a rock in here, but hold on.
[356:16.03]I can't do this out of order.
[356:27.45]You gotta realign the timeline.
[356:28.75]That's what I'm trying to do.
[356:29.53]I fucked up the timeline.
[356:33.34]How?
[356:34.60]Don't buy the map this time.
[356:35.84]Yeah, why would I?
[356:36.50]I'm not buying the map.
[356:39.10]It's a greed fight.
[356:40.12]Oh, right.
[356:40.52]Where is it?
[356:40.96]Down here?
[356:41.28]This timeline's fucked up.
[356:50.00]I had more than three hearts by this point.
[357:02.66]Telepills?
[357:04.10]Right.
[357:13.15]There's Judgment.
[357:13.99]Oh, yeah, right, right.
[357:14.99]I spawned Judgment.
[357:16.09]I got HP up.
[357:17.31]We're not doing this yet.
[357:17.91]We're going to change the timeline.
[357:25.05]Okay, I remember this.
[357:27.23]Soul Generator.
[357:28.05]We went in here.
[357:32.32]Do not buy the map right now.
[357:34.82]So that's... We're fucking with the timeline a little bit.
[357:48.68]Donation is 5.04.
[357:49.69]Hold on.
[357:52.61]The donation is at 5.04?
[357:53.41]How?
[357:53.87]Doesn't make any sense.
[358:02.23]Wait, is this different?
[358:10.31]Merging.
[358:12.51]Okay, I gotta do... Give me the two of diamonds.
[358:21.26]Use it.
[358:21.88]I'll have like 50 or 60 coins.
[358:24.20]Where's the greed fight?
[358:25.54]It didn't even happen.
[358:29.88]wait I'm gonna I'm gonna tell the pills into the green fight right okay let's try that oh well alright well I just started the world worth free so uh
[358:59.05]Okay.
[358:59.99]Um, well... I don't even need to go to the secret area, either.
[359:05.73]But I need hearts.
[359:08.49]Fuck.
[359:09.07]Why did it have to happen?
[359:09.85]Okay, well, let's just slow down.
[359:13.69]Use this.
[359:14.09]44.
[359:18.37]Get judgment.
[359:18.99]Get my lunch.
[359:24.78]Okay, well, hearts in the secret area.
[359:25.92]That's true.
[359:29.66]This is new.
[359:30.38]There's the sun.
[359:31.14]Okay.
[359:31.62]This still is intact.
[359:38.28]Here we go.
[359:47.28]And then he gives you one.
[359:53.04]Boom.
[359:53.20]Okay.
[359:53.60]Good.
[359:54.98]So far, so good.
[359:56.58]Now I need to go buy a bomb.
[359:59.59]While we continue to correct this timeline.
[360:09.41]Go get a shitload of Spirit Hearths.
[360:18.34]Fight the boss first.
[360:21.26]Buy a bomb.
[360:22.16]Forget about the map, I don't need it at this point.
[360:29.42]I had to do that.
[360:30.52]That's to prevent the crash.
[360:36.34]Any rocks that I missed.
[360:37.24]Important.
[360:50.45]Alright.
[361:00.85]Remember, I was like, oh, fuck, I can't get in there.
[361:02.67]Ah, shit, let's go.
[361:05.07]Probably took the same amount of damage here.
[361:19.99]There's telephiles again.
[361:20.91]Let's see if we can get greed.
[361:22.05]No.
[361:22.23]What are you doing?
[361:35.35]Wait, I could buy... Can I buy this?
[361:39.12]Yeah.
[361:39.72]I'm gonna get that by the big fly thing.
[361:48.52]Wait, that doesn't really do anything for me.
[361:53.59]I don't even have flies.
[361:55.41]I don't have any flies.
[361:56.99]Buy the bomb, too.
[361:59.45]Sure.
[362:05.76]Oh, I know I'm fucking with the timeline here, but... Could have been some cool shit in there.
[362:12.42]Fuck you.
[362:19.76]I just fucked up the whole thing for no reason.
[362:21.55]Oh my god, I've ruined everything for no reason.
[362:23.47]How did I get grabbed?
[362:44.55]When you make me do it again, I have apparently trouble.
[362:52.05]But what is this?
[362:52.53]This is Antibirth.
[362:53.43]I don't know why I just almost said Star Wars Antibirth.
[362:58.14]This is Antibirth.
[363:05.14]Alright, we're good.
[363:06.58]Back to where we were before.
[363:07.78]Get the sun card and get the hell out of here.
[363:14.28]That bounce is fucked up.
[363:15.26]This is weird.
[363:23.70]Okay.
[363:27.02]Am I missing anything?
[363:33.48]There's a couple other... There's a couple other things I can do.
[363:39.44]There's some tinted rocks.
[363:40.40]I know there is.
[363:50.41]Alright, where's another tinted rock?
[363:53.88]No, I'm not gonna get the worm.
[363:55.22]It's the sun.
[364:00.22]A boss room.
[364:04.99]Alright, I'm ready.
[364:09.27]Beautiful.
[364:10.35]I'm gonna break these too.
[364:11.37]Okay, what is it?
[364:14.21]Not bad.
[364:15.89]Not bad.
[364:25.48]falling okay that was so unbelievable and then here we go this is my damage resistance now which makes it this is impossible for me to lose okay let's get the fuck out of here
[365:16.74]Okay.
[365:17.38]Just float up.
[365:18.80]Float up.
[365:19.06]Just float up.
[365:21.66]You... Who did that?
[365:22.70]Which one of you guys knocked into it?
[365:25.11]Get out of the way.
[365:25.79]Whatever.
[365:26.09]Alright, let's go.
[365:29.79]Finally.
[365:30.21]No crash.
[365:32.07]No crash.
[365:32.65]Good.
[365:34.30]Mausoleum 2.
[365:35.48]Curse of Darkness.
[365:36.12]My favorite one.
[365:36.74]Great.
[365:46.34]Alright, good, good, good.
[365:48.02]Looking good.
[365:48.82]Is it a hair?
[365:56.93]Is it a brain?
[365:58.25]Alright, Timeline's fine, because he's Greed.
[366:10.11]Oh, Steam Tail?
[366:12.61]Wow.
[366:20.35]Double puberty.
[366:25.50]This build is fucking just diarrhea-ing all over everything.
[366:29.30]It's great.
[366:30.26]I love it.
[366:32.58]I'm so powerful.
[366:36.72]And I haven't even taken a hit this time.
[366:39.01]Where am I?
[366:39.47]What?
[366:41.17]How can I fire?
[366:45.41]Stop doing that.
[366:46.01]What the fuck?
[366:53.50]They teleport around.
[366:54.20]That's cool.
[366:55.30]It's different.
[366:55.90]It's different.
[366:56.32]Let's go up.
[367:04.04]I have infinite health here.
[367:07.22]Actually, I'm going to take some hits because I want to build up Samson's damage.
[367:12.26]I'm going to take some hits.
[367:14.30]Just hit me.
[367:15.14]Don't hit me.
[367:15.90]Back.
[367:16.38]Kill me.
[367:17.12]Perfect.
[367:18.48]One.
[367:19.92]Two.
[367:21.59]Three.
[367:23.28]Four.
[367:25.10]Five.
[367:25.95]One more.
[367:27.03]Six.
[367:27.39]There we go.
[367:27.83]Okay.
[367:35.51]Keep going.
[367:51.96]You fucked it, dammit, what?
[367:55.00]What?
[367:55.20]What did I do?
[367:59.69]What?
[368:04.67]What, there's a puzzle?
[368:05.47]You have to shoot specific fires?
[368:11.73]Sorry.
[368:17.89]It's just a room with fires in it.
[368:19.37]I don't know.
[368:19.85]I'll remember that for next time.
[368:27.78]We'll get him next time.
[368:35.19]It's the boss room already.
[368:38.39]I don't want to do that yet.
[368:39.03]I'm so powerful.
[368:40.05]You know when you play Isaac and you have a build that's so good and you're so destructive that you just want to go kill every room?
[368:54.38]You just want to kill everything.
[368:56.28]He's just so powerful.
[369:02.48]because it's so easy in this game just to have like a shitty build and run into a wall and die and be mad so when you get to actually kill things very quickly it's a lot of fun it's great and I'm and I want full bar there we go don't give him the infinity stone oh secret
[369:38.80]hey look it's the goat head I found him that's too much help am I maxed for a samson I could just test it and not triple puberty am I max already with samson oh yeah
[370:16.78]He just died.
[370:17.26]I didn't do anything.
[370:23.62]Easy.
[370:30.10]I'm unstoppable.
[370:30.84]I have a never-ending supply of hearts.
[370:38.77]What if it hurt me?
[370:39.41]I don't even care.
[370:42.21]It doesn't even hurt, for real, because then I just replace it.
[370:52.14]Alright, we're gonna... What's this?
[370:54.10]Ooh!
[370:56.73]Give me these.
[370:58.15]Alright, what's this one?
[371:00.55]I can see forever.
[371:01.47]Cool.
[371:03.01]Puberty... More puberty.
[371:07.04]Puberty five.
[371:09.92]Puberty six.
[371:27.14]Am I going to wrap around him eventually or no?
[371:35.03]This is good.
[371:35.47]No, it doesn't.
[371:36.51]I did it.
[371:37.07]Don't touch anything.
[371:37.67]Don't touch anything.
[371:38.41]What do I do?
[371:39.05]This is too late.
[371:53.46]This is for the fire.
[371:56.36]Oh.
[372:00.70]Well, oh well.
[372:04.22]That's the solution to the fire.
[372:05.58]Yeah, OK.
[372:06.78]Alright, we're out.
[372:15.95]On to the final area.
[372:21.78]Painted rocks don't even matter.
[372:22.92]I have full health, full everything.
[372:31.20]Alright, is this the time?
[372:32.16]Time to fight the boss?
[372:33.48]I think so.
[372:34.08]Let's move.
[372:42.73]I haven't even found the item room yet.
[372:43.91]Wait, I just got the... Is there an item room?
[373:00.76]Is it weird that I don't even want it?
[373:01.80]I'm not doing that.
[373:07.77]Free chest?
[373:12.39]Oh, right.
[373:18.05]Speed up and health down.
[373:20.70]Not taking that.
[373:33.81]Alright, is this a puzzle or something?
[373:35.38]What the fuck is going on?
[373:36.64]Finally, Bob's brain.
[373:39.06]I got... What's happening?
[373:45.06]What am I stepping on?
[373:47.06]What the fuck?
[373:47.88]Stop doing that.
[373:48.68]Okay, there's a puzzle here.
[373:54.59]Where is it?
[373:55.11]Alright, so what do I press?
[373:56.21]Okay, we got... This one was already pressed.
[374:13.41]One was already pressed.
[374:14.69]This one was already stepped on.
[374:16.27]I didn't step on this one.
[374:31.64]It's not a puzzle with fate.
[374:32.95]Yeah, so tell the people in chat.
[374:45.05]I'm dead.
[374:46.41]Oh, finally, item room.
[374:50.45]Should I get the poop hat?

[385:48.31]I'm going to go up.
[385:55.36]I don't want the other one.
[385:57.68]That other item is something I don't want.
[385:59.14]I don't like it.
[386:09.43]I don't want that item.
[386:19.68]Here comes the pride before the fall.
[386:21.66]What?
[386:23.04]There's no way I lose this.
[386:24.86]I'm going to just absolutely face melt everything.
[386:30.49]There's no way I lose.
[386:31.21]I can't lose.
[386:35.07]No, there actually is a way that I lose.
[386:37.21]If the game crashes, or if I, like... I don't know.

[386:43.03]Okay, if I get, like, sick right now, and, like, puke sick, like, I have to leave.
[386:48.11]Then, yeah, I'll turn it off.
[386:50.46]Okay.
[386:59.86]Holy shit, what was that?
[387:03.00]Why did that just happen?
[387:14.69]It's the first item reusable fly hive.
[387:20.39]Oh, that's I got the big flies.
[387:21.99]That's right.
[387:50.74]Very cool.
[387:51.46]Very cool.
[387:53.75]Very cool.
[387:54.51]I almost got hit by that.
[387:58.45]That would have been embarrassing.
[388:05.54]What on Earth is this?
[388:07.28]Jawbreaker?
[388:08.17]Don't chew it.
[388:19.35]Tears have a chance to become a tooth dealing more than triple damage.
[388:24.99]That's not possible though.
[388:31.62]Right, this is not possible.
[388:36.50]Only a quarter.
[388:50.90]Sometimes you gotta just stand still.
[388:55.70]Yep.
[388:57.26]Look at all these flies, too.
[388:58.74]Am I missing something?
[389:00.00]I could use the sun right now, but why would I?
[389:01.60]Almost a full stack.
[389:14.24]Yeah.
[389:14.64]Pretty good.
[389:21.04]Viper on your head or it's pre-recorded.
[389:22.60]That's a new one.
[389:42.63]Somebody earlier said, oh wow, what a hard game.
[389:48.99]It's getting to this point is how it gets hard.
[389:51.45]Ooh, wow.
[389:54.42]Hard game, huh?
[390:02.64]Well, there's two of those.
[390:14.14]I didn't even try to kill that guy and he died.
[390:19.63]I looked in that guy's direction and he died.
[390:32.06]Here we go!
[390:34.00]Isaac!
[390:51.45]I can, like, punch him around now.
[391:01.67]Goodbye.
[391:04.63]The journey continues.
[391:06.13]Ooh, don't leave that.
[391:07.09]I... No angel room or anything.
[391:12.48]That sucks.
[391:16.14]Gonna have to kill... Wait, could I get another angel room?
[391:21.89]piggy bank boom spectral I mean spectral tier is that's cool looking with the joker maybe piggy bank my life savings uh reasonable soul protection I I mean it's just it's not even worth it I have already have that all pretty useful alright hope for a joker card
[391:55.70]First guy died so fast.
[391:58.64]Are the Spectral Tears fucking up the damage?
[392:16.71]Maybe?
[392:17.03]I don't think so.
[392:27.94]I just shot him in the fucking head with a shotgun.
[392:31.47]Like, holy fuck, that was ridiculous.
[392:35.67]It's a hard game, Jeremy.
[392:39.63]It is a hard game.
[392:44.13]We just got very lucky three or four times.
[392:46.11]I actually should take some damage here.
[392:50.32]Just a little, to get the extra damage.
[393:04.13]Alright.
[393:07.10]You're on journalist difficulty?
[393:08.40]This is on the hardest difficulty.
[393:11.78]This is on hard.
[393:14.04]There is no other... This is normal and hard.
[393:16.73]It's on hard.
[393:17.39]Everybody's seven.
[393:43.00]another kids game Jeremy come on
[394:00.63]You're better than this?
[394:03.31]Am I though?
[394:04.28]You sure?
[394:04.62]Are you certain of that?
[394:14.60]Nobody can even contest me.
[394:16.32]I'm uncontestable.
[394:22.01]Just take it.
[394:22.69]Who cares?
[394:41.31]Nice try.
[394:53.16]Not even a chance.
[394:53.84]This is great.
[394:54.30]Remember when I was up here last time?
[395:01.24]It was just like dodging and freaking out and... Watch out!
[395:04.56]Oh, fuck.
[395:04.86]I had like four hearts or something.
[395:07.04]Five hearts.
[395:10.95]I want to get hit.
[395:13.01]Just to, like, you know... I feel like I'm playing.
[395:23.52]It feels so good, though.
[395:26.48]Starting at zero again, after you do something like this, it all... Okay, you ever jump on a trampoline?
[395:31.94]For a long time.
[395:33.16]And then you get off the trampoline and you jump.
[395:36.59]And your whole world is upside down.
[395:43.24]It feels like you missed the superpower.
[395:45.40]The superpower is gone and fucked with you.
[395:47.34]Give me the money.
[395:54.94]I'll take my pain.
[396:10.25]Hit me again.
[396:15.40]I'm not done.
[396:16.02]I'm not done.
[396:16.46]I want to keep killing people.
[396:18.53]I'm not done.
[396:19.01]Give me that money.
[396:47.07]Oh, that's it.
[396:48.41]There's no more people for me to attack.
[396:50.35]And no... Joker card.
[397:00.76]Okay, good.
[397:15.36]I'm not even gonna move!
[397:24.89]99 coin.
[397:25.68]Yeah!
[397:26.42]Too bad I couldn't do... Well, Delirium's not in this one because this replaces Afterbirth, right?
[397:50.75]Bloody penny, really?
[398:20.88]You're playing easy mode now?
[398:22.89]No, they nerfed him.
[398:23.71]I remember when they nerfed him.
[398:24.71]He used to be so much better.
[398:25.51]Remember when he was better than this?
[398:50.97]I'm not going to play for very much longer.
[398:54.01]I'm just addicted to the game, to be honest with you.
[399:08.89]I was waiting for it.
[399:09.71]There it is.
[399:18.63]Ah!
[399:19.25]Sorry.
[399:27.44]I need to go to at least the item room.
[399:28.66]I'm just trying to go fast.
[399:32.72]Not even playing as the Lost?
[399:33.94]No, I'm not.
[399:34.68]I like to have fun when I play a video game.
[399:41.02]And you pick that character if you don't like to have any fun.
[399:44.88]Rock Blast?
[399:45.72]What is... stone bombs?
[399:53.18]Oh, shit.
[399:53.86]Okay.
[399:55.14]That's kind of cool.
[400:04.31]Goat again.
[400:04.87]I think the goat's been in every single seed.
[400:10.08]It has been.
[400:11.48]How many games have I actually played?
[400:13.38]Seven?
[400:14.00]Six?
[400:16.20]The goat's been in all six or seven of these.
[400:18.97]Here's a seed if you want it.
[400:27.59]I'm going down back into the river zone, whatever it is.
[400:30.93]I just want to see this place again.
[400:32.43]This is cool.
[400:33.59]I like this.
[400:33.91]Am I going to stream this again?
[400:42.40]Yeah, probably.
[400:47.48]This will be a filler.
[400:52.78]This would be filler content.
[400:55.83]Or something that I, you know, if we get to the end of something and I'm like, you know, what can I do for three hours?
[400:59.43]It's going to be this.
[401:00.03]Oh, okay.
[401:12.76]Ooh.
[401:13.80]Full health.
[401:14.28]Doesn't matter.
[401:14.72]Balls of steel.
[401:16.28]That does matter.
[401:17.55]Bombs.
[401:17.99]I need to keep two bombs.
[401:21.41]But that counts as two bombs.
[401:24.71]What's going on here?
[401:25.31]What's this mean?
[401:26.79]Bomb or something?
[401:28.81]Bomb in the middle?
[401:33.37]Bomb the bed?
[401:33.95]That skips the whole level.
[401:41.74]Bomb the bed.
[401:42.88]Whoa.
[401:46.56]Oh, it just refills your health, right?
[401:48.90]Alright, I'll blow the bed up.
[401:52.42]Oh, nice.
[401:52.72]I get three hearts.
[401:53.30]Cool.
[401:53.82]Okay.
[401:54.72]I don't want to skip.
[401:59.33]I mean, I want to go fast, but I don't want to skip.
[402:11.74]I have the spirit hearts when I need to deposit them.
[402:15.88]I mean, it's absolutely HP up.
[402:27.37]I know it's cheap, but I'm not taking it.
[402:28.75]I mean, I'm Azazel.
[402:30.96]No.
[402:41.40]Is this dude drunk?
[402:42.91]I don't think so.
[402:50.01]Shit, that hurt.
[402:52.60]Okay, I got the bombs.
[402:54.50]Let's go.
[402:54.72]I'm ready.
[402:56.77]Wormwood.
[403:06.87]Whoa.
[403:07.35]I have to get back?
[403:11.04]I'm trying to get too close to this shit.
[403:15.08]Where is it?
[403:19.56]Whoa!
[403:19.70]That was fast.
[403:52.83]Okay.
[403:53.49]This is ridiculous.
[403:55.73]Uh... You want Dark... Dark Bum?
[403:59.49]Yeah, Dark Bum is good.
[404:02.94]That's it.
[404:06.66]Tell us the shit stain story.
[404:08.52]You got... There's no shit stain story!
[404:15.94]Where's the next, uh, part?
[404:16.92]Am I out of my mind?
[404:19.60]Where is it?
[404:24.17]Oh, there's a part two.
[404:32.91]All the shit stains.
[404:34.75]You guys are fucking crazy.
[404:36.39]What are you even talking about?
[405:06.99]What?
[405:07.43]Hold on, I can't... Tell us the... Oh, tell us the shit stain story.
[405:14.46]Oh, sure, okay.
[405:15.24]One time, I shit my pants and didn't get rid of the underwear or something, and then, oh, haha, that's it.
[405:22.22]Okay, that was it.
[405:28.87]Did you need any more than that?
[405:29.97]Oh, this is wicked hard, hold on.
[405:41.90]Alright, what's this?
[405:44.52]Trickle, charge, battery?
[405:45.73]No.
[405:45.85]There's a heart in here.
[405:47.53]Alright, take this.
[405:49.61]Give me a spirit heart.
[405:55.15]Thank you!
[405:58.31]Ooh!
[405:59.95]Just have him hit that.
[406:00.73]Yeah, nice.

[406:51.07]Thank you so much.
[406:51.81]You're so helpful.
[407:01.50]There's so many enemies in here.
[407:03.12]Alright, let's go.
[407:06.76]No keys.
[407:17.56]I just shit myself.
[407:18.58]I just shit myself.
[407:20.54]I can't even say it.
[407:22.12]I just shit myself.
[407:23.06]Should I throw out the underwear?
[407:25.80]Yes, you should.
[407:27.03]Yes.
[407:28.43]Just get new underwear or something.
[407:31.05]I don't know.
[407:31.89]Yes, you should.

[408:35.24]I don't like having to get too close to these people.
[408:43.74]You got something for me?
[408:44.74]You just picked up a full heart.
[408:45.84]Come on, man.
[408:46.16]What are you talking about?
[408:48.30]You don't have anything for me?
[408:52.86]He's above.
[408:59.80]Bye.

[409:17.92]That's too many.
[409:19.14]That's too many.
[409:23.45]Go back to the empty room.
[409:45.15]I wouldn't even look and... There it is.
[409:53.05]Knife Piece 1.
[410:00.95]What does the knife piece do?
[410:01.99]What do you get?
[410:09.62]Knife Piece 2.
[410:10.50]Is this a new DLC?
[410:11.40]This is a mod.
[410:12.10]It will be a new DLC soon enough.
[410:23.23]This will be official DLC in a few months.
[410:27.05]Something like that.
[410:32.57]From my understanding... I can't... I don't know.
[410:36.89]From my understanding, Edmund McMillan is working on this in his sort of random off time.
[410:41.59]It's not like a priority, is it?
[410:42.89]I don't think.
[410:43.41]It's been actually a couple of years, hasn't it?
[410:46.67]Since it was announced.
[410:47.37]At least a year or two.
[410:50.73]And it's going to use the Antibirth mod.
[410:52.43]And there's going to be other additions too, apparently.
[410:56.03]It's not just going to be Antibirth.
[411:06.74]Well, I got plenty of spirit hearts.
[411:09.11]Hope I don't lose them.
[411:17.86]Oh, he hates the mod.
[411:20.16]He hates it.

[430:19.38]No reason for those to be here.
[430:20.44]Dude, get the nail.
[430:25.32]For some reason, I don't know why, but I thought that maybe, like, I was gonna miss out on my opportunity to get the nail.
[430:34.08]Like, someone's like, dude, go get nail.
[430:35.32]Are you stupid?
[430:36.36]Like, you gotta get that nail now.

[430:38.50]There's gotta be a reason why you're telling me to do this now.
[430:42.38]I'm not an Isaac expert.
[430:44.77]What do I know?
[430:49.63]I got a cheat sheet over here, for God's sake.
[430:57.64]Talking on that one.

[431:19.08]Well, there we go.
[431:29.83]Well, at least I'll finish this fairly quickly.
[431:35.40]Is it selfish of me to want more damage?
[431:40.44]Is it selfish of me to say I want damage?
[431:42.24]I want a bunch more.
[431:47.23]Alright, let's go.
[431:49.97]I'm going to do one more room so I can get another nail.
[432:00.34]Alright, let's go.
[432:05.40]There's nothing in here.

[432:49.83]Doesn't do anything, right?
[432:51.89]Doesn't do anything?
[433:08.09]it's too late.

[436:01.88]Fuck you.
[436:11.21]How come there's not two nickels?
[436:13.73]This game's a liar.
[436:14.49]This game's a broken, bugged game.
[436:27.08]What the fuck was that?

[436:48.30]And then we got all the ones in the middle on the other side.
[436:52.46]So just make the smiley face.
[436:54.38]So those are the ones I have to blow out.
[436:58.12]Okay.
[436:59.22]And then all the ones in the middle on the right side.
[437:02.21]So top left, top right.
[437:03.27]Finish the smile.
[437:21.58]The ones that are lit are the ones that need to stay lit.
[437:24.73]Oh, okay.
[437:25.07]Damn.
[437:53.41]I have so many items.

[439:14.30]Okay, don't.
[439:16.71]Nobody move.
[439:18.87]So the ones that were lit are the ones that have to stay turned on, right?
[439:28.72]Is that accurate?
[439:31.30]The ones that were lit are the ones that were turned on.
[439:40.28]So, get rid of these two up here.
[439:42.60]Okay, there's the smiley face.
[439:53.26]Were these on?

[443:48.12]And you... Am I not, um... Is there a reason why I'm not Guppy?
[444:04.91]You are.
[444:05.27]Why didn't it go... Ow.
[444:07.29]Oh.
[444:26.45]That's an afterbirth, though.
[444:29.61]Well, this is... I'm going to one-hit kill every enemy in the whole game.
[444:33.81]This is Tammy's head.
[444:34.61]Check this out.
[444:35.21]Watch this.
[444:35.61]Holy shit.
[444:38.75]Okay.
[444:39.69]Fantastic.
[444:40.45]I can do it in every room.
[444:41.76]Oh, I am guppy.
[444:43.34]Oh, I'm unstoppable.
[444:45.04]How do I do the hardest thing in the game?
[444:46.72]What's the hardest thing in the game I can do right now?
[444:56.84]Mega Satan.
[444:57.38]But I can't even do Mega Satan.
[445:03.92]What's a four?
[445:11.84]Rerolls all pedestal items on the floor.
[445:14.18]Does not roll your devil item.
[445:17.96]Do it no balls.
[445:19.04]Hit it.
[445:27.74]What is that?
[445:35.82]What is that thing?
[445:58.01]Enemies get feared if they come... Enemies get feared.
[446:00.45]Enemies get feared if they come near you.
[446:08.47]Wasted broken combo again.
[446:09.91]I really didn't mean to.
[446:12.59]This is not my second time being down in the Antibirth cellar.
[446:18.07]You gotta do it a few times before you get it.
[446:19.55]I'm gonna pick up the shovel.
[446:31.57]uh hopper down up on the paw go back to the paw room I mean the paw room oh the nail and the paw will be different it re-rolls all okay I see what you mean
[447:04.42]Well, this is just a ton of damage.
[447:07.56]What a broken fucking combo!
[447:09.76]It's so broken, and I didn't get to do the... I'm so upset by this.
[447:13.15]This is seriously, like, it's just probably the best thing I'll have in a long time.
[447:19.59]And I didn't even get the third fucking second piece.
[447:22.25]Why did I have to listen to that person?
[447:23.93]One person just was like, go get it, dude.
[447:25.24]What are you doing?
[447:26.60]Oh, it's a tinted rock.
[447:27.58]It doesn't matter.
[447:28.08]Up or down?
[447:36.67]Down.
[447:37.65]Go down.
[447:38.23]Go beat Satan.
[447:38.89]Okay.
[447:39.09]Fuck.
[447:45.54]Like, check this out.
[447:48.10]This is insane.
[447:49.08]I don't even know what I just got.
[447:50.61]HP up?
[447:52.81]Look at how many minions I have.
[448:03.10]This is the kind of build that... This is what beats, like, Delirium.
[448:06.69]You go and you fight Delirium with this and it's like... It's too bad I don't have that.
[448:10.44]This is the wrong game.
[448:29.60]This is the most broken fucking thing.
[448:31.06]I can't believe I'm not fighting the last boss.
[448:34.50]I'm so sad.
[448:37.08]Look at this shit.
[448:38.20]It's unbelievable.
[448:39.96]No one can touch me.
[448:40.96]For real.
[448:42.00]Just go.
[448:42.34]Fuck.
[448:42.50]This would have been so...
[449:11.75]Oh, well.
[449:13.59]That was insane.
[449:14.53]Oh, imagine that.
[449:18.27]Actually, you know, I'm kind of glad.
[449:20.43]I'm kind of glad that I didn't see the last boss in Antiberth.
[449:23.23]You know why?
[449:23.61]Because I want to fight the last boss.
[449:26.69]I don't want to delete the last boss.
[449:29.04]I would have deleted the last boss.
[449:34.82]There's the negative.
[449:36.58]Okay, good.
[449:40.20]Let's just do the new character.
[449:42.08]Bethany.
[449:42.96]Book of Virtues.
[449:45.84]Three hearts.
[449:46.46]Terrible damage and really slow.
[449:56.58]This is pretty terrible.
[449:57.40]What's this do?
[450:01.84]Is he familiar?
[450:02.60]How often can I use it?
[450:05.63]It stays with you the whole time?
[450:21.60]Wait, what is it?
[450:22.30]It's gone.
[450:24.26]Ten bombs.
[450:40.66]Well, what's with the new currency down there?
[450:41.92]I have four, four what?
[450:55.57]Yeah, there's a new currency down there.
[450:59.70]Four hearts of some kind?
[451:06.86]Hold R just to reset faster.
[451:08.45]Oh, right.
[451:08.81]I'm trying to hold R in my controller.
[451:12.25]Don't add spirit hearts.
[451:14.41]Clearly.
[451:18.13]Actually, this is not good.
[451:20.11]Yeah, I've been scrimming for a while.
[451:21.31]Yeah, yeah.
[451:22.41]That was probably the end.
[451:23.31]That was the end.
[451:24.67]I'm going to do it again.
[451:25.45]I can't stop.
[451:33.74]What do I do?
[451:36.92]Soul hearts are charges for your active item.
[451:41.48]That's actually pretty cool.
[451:43.58]You guys thought this character sucked?
[451:55.58]So what's the point?
[451:56.30]Should I not be using it?
[451:57.36]Should I just try not to get the thing hit?
[452:09.63]Don't listen to that.
[452:12.49]Keep pressing it.
[452:13.09]Holy shit.
[452:16.35]What?
[452:19.13]Oh, man.
[452:19.71]Okay, this is actually pretty cool.
[452:24.57]But they can be destroyed.
[452:25.77]And you don't get soul hearts anymore.
[452:29.91]I get it.
[452:30.97]Try not to let them die.
[452:33.75]I see.
[452:43.31]Shit!
[452:44.83]I have to... I have to stay.
[452:53.01]I have to stay.
[452:53.61]I just got like the... Alright, don't... I got... Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[452:57.51]I'm probably going to lose.
[453:02.93]But, you know, I... Extra luck too.
[453:08.99]I need the item room.
[453:18.02]Damn, that's kind of hard to do that.
[453:43.58]I'm gonna die on floor one.
[453:48.36]Well, you can't say past tense died on floor one when it hasn't happened yet.
[454:05.64]You reset.
[454:07.30]You know how many people play this game and they go to the first room?
[454:11.04]They go to the item room and it's not the exact fucking one thing that they want and they reset 200 times until they get the one thing they want.
[454:20.85]Sorry, I reset once in seven and a half hours.
[454:28.63]Sue me.
[454:29.53]This actually might be a reset because this item is not very good.
[454:47.26]Alright, what is it?
[454:50.82]Oh, too bad.
[454:54.98]Power, please.
[455:03.59]Those are two awful items, but I did get that really good damage up item.
[455:08.71]I'm willing to give it one solid attempt.
[455:11.61]Use the book.
[455:13.39]Oh, okay.
[455:17.02]I just burped really loud.
[455:18.20]I think he didn't hear it.
[455:27.20]Use those soul hearts?
[455:27.94]No, I'm storing them.
[455:29.64]How many can you have?
[455:30.24]As many as you want?
[455:32.16]How many can you have around you?
[455:33.12]A ton.
[455:45.90]They stay with you with floor to floor.
[455:47.39]That's good.
[455:48.07]What am I missing here?
[455:55.95]Just try to keep them alive.
[456:09.62]Just stay the hell away from everybody.
[456:23.52]Keep getting more and more bust them.
[456:26.11]And bust them.
[456:31.57]Fuck.
[456:33.08]This is the end.
[456:35.66]This is the worst thing that could have happened to me.
[456:38.72]This is the worst enemy that could have
[456:49.74]Actually died to fly.
[456:51.08]Well, no, I died to the thing.
[456:52.14]That was something.
[456:52.95]Okay, that's it.
[456:53.55]Good night.
[456:55.95]I didn't see it.
[456:57.59]Wait, what is one of these?
[456:58.25]Holy... Turbo?
[457:12.24]Turbo?
[457:18.32]Wait, is the whole game times two?
[457:29.74]I'll never attempt this ever again.
[457:30.82]This hurts.
[457:32.16]This hurts my head, actually.
[457:34.30]It really does.
[457:50.03]Kills, heal.
[457:50.79]Okay, cool.
[457:55.50]Go, go, go, go.
[457:56.08]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[457:56.98]As fast as I can.
[457:57.50]What do I have to kill?
[458:01.47]His mom's heart?
[458:23.36]These guys are so much harder when they're faster.
[458:30.47]Oh, fuck!
[458:31.13]Oh, try it again.
[458:31.65]Try it again.
[458:31.93]Try it again.
[458:32.21]Try it again.
[458:32.47]Try it again.

[461:02.88]It looks just stupid enough for us to enjoy it.

[462:03.84]Thanks for the 250.
[462:04.38]Yo, funny man, I got laid out from my job.
[462:06.69]My laptop that was really important for my music production died.
[462:09.53]And I got rejected from university.
[462:11.71]I really wanted to get into.
[462:13.37]All within a single week.
[462:14.21]It's kind of funny how fast things can go into shit.
[462:17.42]Anyways, thanks for cheering me up even in my darkest days.
[462:19.58]Love from Finland.
[462:23.58]Sorry to hear about this shitty week.
[462:26.82]That's just what it is, right?
[462:29.19]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[462:30.49]That's a lot to take in.
[462:33.24]That's a lot to do.
[462:34.58]That's a lot for you to have to deal with.
[462:42.63]I seriously wish you the best of luck in trying to figure out all this stuff.
[462:45.93]I'm sure you will.
[462:46.61]It might take a little time, but I'm sure you will.
[462:59.52]Thanks for hanging out here.
[463:02.07]and cheers from America the one thing I will tell you is if this is one of those really really awful weeks that's just a terrible week
[463:22.08]You may have just rolled the dice, and they may have landed very, very badly.
[463:26.96]And something like this probably won't happen to you again.
[463:29.92]At least in that succession.
[463:31.56]You got, like, the dice roll of just a bunch of bad shit in a row.
[463:37.25]I wish there's something that could be done about it.
[463:41.59]But sometimes life throws us these weighted dice.
[463:49.19]Unfortunately.
[463:53.04]You have a gambling problem.
[463:54.73]Dice?
[463:55.49]Bad?
[463:55.81]What?
[463:56.11]But I really do wish you the best of luck.
[464:08.00]Take care of yourself.
[464:10.05]Sorry to hear about that.
[464:12.07]Vegas is not good for your well-being.
[464:15.53]I don't go to the casino.
[464:19.30]I don't go to the casino.
[464:20.78]I go to the casino like once every like five months.
[464:25.62]I don't know how you guys don't understand this.
[464:33.26]Some old chips there.
[464:37.83]Move those out of the way.
[464:41.17]Hey, Kaboo, thanks for the 500 bits.
[464:42.51]Dermot, have you ever heard of the game Underhero?
[464:47.13]It's an RPG on Steam that I really think you'd enjoy.
[464:49.07]Check it out.
[464:52.36]Um... Underhero.
[464:57.56]I'll give it a look.
[464:59.90]Is it good?
[465:00.48]Is it a streamable game or is it something that just to play in my off time?
[465:11.37]I'm sorry to say this, but I'm afraid I have to leave.
[465:13.29]I found a more fog champ streamer.
[465:23.77]I wish you do the best I wish I hope that the most PogChamp person you could possibly include in your daily video life this is not pog unsubbed have fun hey seven layer wario thanks for the thousand bits
[465:45.79]Not necessarily, because... Your vocal cords are your vocal cords.
[466:07.15]There's not much you can do about changing your vocal cords or the way that like sound comes through them.
[466:13.73]You can manipulate.
[466:15.81]Right?
[466:16.15]Like I can go as... This is as deep as I can go.
[466:21.26]I can't go much deeper than this.
[466:23.84]Right?
[466:24.38]Right.
[466:25.84]but there are people on this Earth that for some reason their vocal cords and their and their trachea have been able to go even deeper to the point where they're people there's some people that have insanely booming deep voices I don't know that physiologically how that all really works
[466:55.64]smoke a lot that's not gonna work they'll just make it sound like this it's Bugleberry with other markiplier yeah markiplier has one of those just like hello everybody buddy it's so it's so incredible people wish they had markiplier's voice they really do his well the way he speaks is so clear and so it's so radio-like
[467:24.04]For me to do Markiplier, I actually have to do this.
[467:31.18]I have to do this.
[467:32.08]And it doesn't even sound right.
[467:35.66]It sounds completely wrong.
[467:43.19]Hello, everybody.
[467:46.71]My name is... Does that sound better?
[467:48.95]Why is it... This shouldn't be echo on it.
[467:52.48]Long story short, he's an incredibly talented man.
[467:56.48]Pretty much all there is to it.
[468:01.44]It's an echo.
[468:01.92]I don't know why the echo's on here.
[468:03.00]The echo's not even turned on.
[468:03.84]There's a button to turn it on.
[468:09.30]Somebody mentioned a speak from the chest, which it's hard to describe, but speaking from the chest and using your entire diaphragm
[468:22.22]That's what singers do.
[468:28.79]Oh, thanks for the 10 bucks?
[468:32.63]Almonder?
[468:33.35]Hi-fi.
[468:34.83]Almonder.
[468:38.83]Hey, DarkSoul, thanks for the 250.
[468:39.89]It's entirely possible you're just a coward.
[468:41.82]I don't know what I did.
[468:45.38]Mr. Krabs eats squeaky boots.
[468:56.48]That's a cartoon character.
[468:57.44]Not a real person.
[469:00.24]That's not a real person eating actual shoes.
[469:04.68]Great Wikipedia edit.
[469:08.80]When it comes to a source for real life.
[469:17.61]Anyways.
[469:19.19]Thanks for the $2.50.
[469:22.05]Hey, actually, Spazzo, thanks for the $5.00.
[469:24.01]Do the funny thing.
[469:24.85]I don't know what the funny thing is.
[469:28.70]I don't know what the funny thing is.
[469:30.00]Hopefully I did it for you.
[469:33.36]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.
[469:34.16]Jeremy, have you ever seen the clip of when Tayzonday streamed TF2 and his audio fucked up?
[469:38.20]I have.
[469:39.58]It's very funny.
[469:43.02]That's another... Talking about voices, that's another big booming.
[469:48.38]I can't even do them.
[469:49.88]Like Markiplier.
[469:51.82]Tate, Tate, Kazon Day.
[469:54.41]Tate, Tate, Tate.
[469:57.15]You can't mimic that.
[469:58.79]Another person that has an insanely booming, just deep radio voice.
[470:06.16]It's incredible.
[470:15.91]I have seen it, though.
[470:16.61]It's when his audio just keeps looping over and over again, and he doesn't know, and he's just playing, and he has his own stream open or something, right?
[470:28.40]Important.
[470:29.06]What?
[470:31.78]Yes, this is very important.
[470:34.34]It's very important.
[470:39.07]I think it needs to be even worse than this, to be honest with you.
[470:49.78]like I think it needs to be like this is good like it's supposed to be very bad like worse way worse this is this like looks good but don't spoil that for anybody no I don't want to show the image that no no we're not spoiling anything this is talking about pre-stream chat spoilers don't do that
[471:21.09]That's very funny, though.
[471:26.81]Hey, Elfkin.
[471:29.07]Thank you, Elfkin, for the $4.
[471:30.03]I don't know if you still have those photos from that Firewatch video you did ages ago.
[471:34.16]But if you do, how much do I have to cheer for you to send them to me?
[471:38.24]Those photos actually went... I believe they actually did go into the trash.
[471:43.66]The real trash.
[471:46.19]Maybe I shredded them.
[471:49.76]I think I may have shredded all those.
[471:53.04]I don't think those exist anymore.
[472:02.97]I'm just gonna dig through the trash and find them.
[472:06.05]Um, I don't think so.
[472:08.86]But unfortunately, I do not have them anymore.
[472:14.59]Well, that's a very easy answer.
[472:15.95]Because I wasn't a streamer.
[472:42.83]back when Bloodborne came out and I played it three or four times in a row.
[472:48.73]I had a Twitch account.
[472:50.79]I streamed maybe once every four or five months, maybe twice a year or something.
[472:57.20]It wasn't really until like 2015, 2016 that I really started actually streaming and spending more than three, four plus kind of days a week doing it.
[473:07.83]It was before Twitch, before I started using it.
[473:15.52]time for another one maybe maybe uh thank you hall of one zombie for the 250 did you ever play out of this world I'd imagine you'd enjoyed it old school platformer but really memorable I have played I have played it but another world that is what they made for some reason uh they changed the title I don't know why another world out of this world the same game
[473:44.20]Dude, what?
[473:44.62]He did stream it.
[473:46.94]Wait, wasn't I shit-faced or something?
[473:48.75]Wait, I did stream it for like an hour, right?
[473:50.37]I was like drunk.
[473:51.55]I was like shit-faced, right?
[473:55.47]Oh, shit!
[474:00.58]Was I drunk when I did this?
[474:04.86]There was a... I remember what... The transition from Boston to Vegas...
[474:13.64]I got trashed one night and played like 10 games in a row, like Minecraft and... Was that part of that?
[474:24.16]That's a fake stream?
[474:25.74]No, no, I think this actually happened.
[474:32.44]That was the best worst stream ever.
[474:36.78]This was in 2016.
[474:37.18]This was a 2016 stream?
[474:41.89]I don't... Well, I guess maybe I did it once.
[474:46.48]But I have played Out of This World, and it is very interesting.
[474:49.48]A fun story about Out of This World, or Another World.
[474:53.74]The person that did that, that is responsible for making that game,
[474:59.99]I'm going to make sure I get this correct because it's a pretty cool piece of information.
[475:04.41]I believe it's the same person that did the Heart of Darkness game.
[475:08.49]Is that a complete lie?
[475:09.55]I don't think it is.
[475:10.09]Remember the Heart of Darkness game?
[475:11.75]That's not a lie, right?
[475:16.26]That's true.
[475:16.68]That's correct, right?
[475:17.54]Yeah, I just want to make sure sometimes you have this knowledge, but you don't remember if it's real or not.
[475:25.76]Does that ever happen to you guys?
[475:29.69]That game is also fun.
[475:30.49]I streamed that game.
[475:32.05]I never beat it though because it's very hard and very frustrating.
[475:35.53]But I have streamed Heart of Darkness.
[475:39.27]It's very fun.
[475:41.57]Wait, did I beat it?
[475:44.90]I might have.
[475:45.32]I don't remember.
[475:49.39]Hey, Spoons, for self-defense, thanks for $15, 1500 bits.
[475:54.51]Thanks a lot for that.
[475:55.13]Hey, Jerma, I don't mean to alarm you or anything, but I hacked your web camera, and I've been recording you for the past four months.
[476:00.02]I want to talk about your abnormal behavior off-stream, but if you turn the stream off, you just sit there motionless, unblinking, without emotion until it's time to turn the stream back on.
[476:08.26]What's the deal with that?
[476:13.41]Um, this is what all streamers do.
[476:18.05]I thought that was common knowledge by now.
[476:21.57]Thanks a lot for the $15.
[476:24.53]Bowen Jackal, thanks for $3.
[476:25.81]The toilet paper shortage has hit us really hard, so it looks like I'll be switching over to diapers soon.
[476:29.91]What brand would you recommend for someone who has long gaming streaming sessions?
[476:35.18]Well, I would recommend the toilet because a diaper is not going to help you because even if you like shit in a diaper, you still have to clean yourself up.
[476:45.62]So that's not going to do very much for you.
[476:49.40]If you piss in a diaper, you're just making yourself dirty.
[476:51.86]You just pee into the bowl in the toilet.
[476:56.67]So, that's not really solving a problem.
[477:02.27]But, thanks for the three bucks.
[477:05.77]Uh, Magic Muffin, thanks for three bucks.
[477:07.24]I had a shit day at work because my co-worker's an asshole.
[477:10.34]Stream cheered me up, though.
[477:11.34]Thanks for that, King.
[477:12.18]I thought it was only one person doing the King thing.
[477:17.24]Wait, is that the one person?
[477:21.95]It is.
[477:22.49]It is that person.
[477:23.55]Oh, it is that one person.
[477:28.04]Sorry to hear that.
[477:28.56]Sorry to hear you're having troubles at work.
[477:32.72]Thanks for three bucks and happy to cheer you up.
[477:35.54]Happy to let you hang out here.
[477:37.97]Well, let you hang out here sounds like I'm allowing you to.
[477:44.35]It's good to have you let you be here.
[477:48.50]This is like a point of entry for monetary... anything like that.
[477:55.30]You're permitting us to hang out here.
[477:57.16]I mean, technically you could ban everyone.
[478:03.04]Yeah, but that is... No, that's... Sorry to hear about your day at work.
[478:10.74]5,000 bits from Vilemi, which is insane.
[478:13.86]Thanks a lot, Vilemi, for the $50.
[478:16.44]Just go off, King.
[478:18.18]I am.
[478:20.53]Thanks for the $50.
[478:21.07]A shitload of money.
[478:26.87]Let's get the... Let's go to the new scene here.
[478:31.87]We're gonna go back to the Wii tomorrow.
[478:34.09]I like playing Binding of Isaac, though.
[478:35.45]It's fun just to play a game that I know at least some stuff about.
[478:38.63]I mean, I'm the greatest player in the world, but it's fun to play it.
[478:44.87]I'm not, like, lost.
[478:46.37]Yes, I am.
[478:46.83]But not like the usual.
[478:47.97]Gonna bump here.
[478:59.63]Is Isaac the go-to 2-3 hour filler game?
[479:02.31]I think it is.
[479:04.59]I think if we need to burn a couple hours, let's say so.
[479:06.97]It's like, oh, it's only been like three or four hours.
[479:09.37]I'll play Isaac for a run or two.
[479:12.09]Easy to do that.
[479:17.40]But here come the credits.
[479:18.16]Here comes all the subs from today.
[479:21.58]Thank you, guys.
[479:23.26]For your continued support.
[479:24.76]And maybe brand new support.
[479:25.96]Maybe you just subbed today.
[479:26.80]Thank you.
[479:28.18]And maybe you got community subbed.
[479:31.57]You gotta be part of the community.
[479:32.77]You gotta be somewhere around.
[479:33.89]You had to have shown up at some point.
[479:35.19]So, thanks.
[479:36.57]Appreciate it.
[479:43.01]Let us continue with the bit.
[479:48.05]Swindlesween.
[479:50.23]Swindlesween.
[479:50.83]Thanks for the $1,600 bit.
[479:52.87]$16.
[479:53.31]Hey, Jerma, I love you.
[479:54.59]Well, you didn't say I. I added that.
[479:56.57]Hey, Jerma, love you.
[479:59.81]I added the I love you.
[480:01.93]So, thanks for the $16.
[480:02.97]And you give a community sub right after that, so thank you.
[480:09.02]WowRL, thanks for the 500 bits.
[480:11.00]No message.
[480:12.00]Just 500 bits.
[480:14.22]Thank you.
[480:16.90]CellJuniors, thanks for 500 bits.
[480:18.40]I don't understand this game with a smiley face.
[480:22.56]If you've never really played it, it can be very confusing.
[480:26.95]Random items and shit.
[480:28.39]I mean, I have hundreds of hours in this game over the course of 10 years.
[480:33.67]And I still need a cheat sheet.
[480:34.94]I still don't know what half this stuff even does when I see it.
[480:40.78]Thank you, though.
[480:42.48]Wembley TTV, thanks for the $2.50.
[480:44.40]Jerma, this is a mod.
[480:45.72]Oh, hey, Jerma, this is a... Wait.
[480:48.60]Jerma, there is a mod.
[480:51.32]There is a mod.
[480:52.38]Okay, I see.
[480:53.64]Hey, Jerma, there is a mod on the Steam Workshop for Afterbirth called The Binding of Undertale.
[480:59.57]It's a really solid mod and has everyone from the game with music and newer bosses and items.
[481:03.79]Are you serious?
[481:06.93]Reading comprehension.
[481:07.83]No, it's not reading comprehension.
[481:11.16]They missed a couple of letters.
[481:13.36]I have to add them in.
[481:14.40]Is that true?
[481:19.48]I'd have to go look that up.
[481:22.30]It's kind of fun.
[481:24.77]Thank you, Wembley.
[481:25.33]Appreciate it.
[481:28.79]Underbirth.
[481:34.75]Eat to burger.
[481:35.53]Thanks for the three bucks.
[481:36.48]What was the last thing you ate and the last thing you drank?
[481:40.12]The last thing that I ate was half of an Italian sub.
[481:45.98]Like an Italian sandwich.
[481:49.72]Last thing I drank was coffee.
[481:57.19]I didn't even go... Holy shit.
[481:58.63]I didn't even go to the bathroom.
[482:01.01]I didn't go to the bathroom one time in eight hours.
[482:06.79]Wow.
[482:07.85]Dude, I have to go pee.
[482:11.86]There was no break!
[482:12.92]I didn't even take a break!
[482:16.88]Did I really just sit here for eight hours and didn't move?
[482:21.56]Holy shit!
[482:32.29]Alright, I gotta get up and fucking move around.
[482:36.75]Well, this was a gamer stream.
[482:38.43]That is true.
[482:39.35]That's accurate.
[482:42.07]That's the last two things I ate and drank.
[482:43.65]Thanks for the three bucks.
[482:46.03]Shadows, one disciple.
[482:47.71]Thanks for the 250.
[482:48.61]Jerba.
[482:49.85]Hey, Jerba, won't be any more donations for a while since I'm saving up for a shamrock shake.
[482:56.10]But anyway, don't you think it's kind of irresponsible to hold a 5,000 person gathering like this with the virus going around?
[483:03.98]What?
[483:06.05]Oh, I see what you're doing.
[483:08.27]I see what you're doing.
[483:10.17]Anyway, I had some ideas for big channel points.
[483:12.55]Replace you with Bugleberry or Grandpa for one minute.
[483:15.23]No.
[483:16.38]I'm going to just knock that down right now.
[483:19.24]Tuber Jerma or Boston Jerma for one minute.
[483:21.92]Say shpee.
[483:26.11]None of these are going to happen.
[483:27.13]I'm going to just be really honest.
[483:29.79]Say shpee instant drew, which I'm assuming is having Nancy Drew game ready to play and tell the shit stain story.
[483:40.10]So you want me to have channel points to tell the same story over and over again.
[483:45.52]So like a hundred thousand channel points is to tell the shit stain story.
[483:50.01]But if it's only one story, so somebody has to do that one time and then nobody has to buy it again.
[483:59.93]None of the- No, none of those are gonna happen.
[484:02.13]No.
[484:08.19]No!
[484:09.27]No.
[484:12.07]No.
[484:19.62]It's so funny.
[484:22.00]Aww.
[484:24.83]I'll put something there.
[484:25.75]There's no shit... I didn't... There is no story.
[484:30.79]You guys made that up and made me think I had a story where I talked about how I shit my pants or something.
[484:37.98]Thanks for the $2.50, though.
[484:40.70]Hey, Patty.
[484:41.86]Thank you, Patty2, for the three bucks.
[484:43.52]Jeremiah, I want to thank you for streaming and making me laugh.
[484:46.06]My mom passed away recently.
[484:48.20]We were working together and I was very close to her.
[484:50.66]Again, thank you so much for just being you.
[484:54.63]May she rest in peace.
[484:55.59]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[485:07.44]Take care of yourself.
[485:10.80]Take as much time that you need to grieve over something like that because that's a major thing to happen.
[485:18.56]I'm really sorry.
[485:28.64]People in the chat have got it correct.
[485:34.07]Stay strong.
[485:38.35]Can't even imagine what you're going through.
[485:40.55]Thanks for sticking around.
[485:41.61]Thanks for hanging out.
[485:43.99]And thanks for the $3.
[485:50.47]We also had 1,500 bits from Dr. Noobstein.
[485:55.82]Thanks for the $15. $15.
[485:59.15]I'm so sorry.
[485:59.87]I was the one guy who told you to get the nail.
[486:01.67]I didn't mean before the puzzle.
[486:03.43]Fuck, I can't believe I didn't get it.
[486:15.18]Oh, I just... Scatterbrain, ADHD brain just didn't process it and didn't keep it in permanent memory.
[486:22.46]That's my own fault.
[486:24.98]There's nobody else's.
[486:25.74]Don't worry.
[486:30.76]Thanks for the $15.
[486:31.48]Hey, Mitchell, thanks for 1,000 bits.
[486:34.84]Thanks for 10 bucks, Mitchell.
[486:35.80]Hey, Jingo, I'm so happy to hear you're finally going to play Hulk Ultimate Destruction.
[486:41.41]Easily in my Desert Island game selection.
[486:46.39]If you ever try the Freedom Force games on stream, I'm going to lose it.
[486:49.33]Thanks for every amazing content.
[486:55.19]Thanks a lot.
[486:56.05]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[486:58.52]Multitrip thanks to 250 Jerma.
[486:59.80]Are you going to play Nioh 2, Omega Lull?
[487:01.94]No.
[487:04.44]No.
[487:05.04]I see that all capitals Omega Lull.
[487:07.20]Yeah, I know.
[487:08.08]No, I'm not going to.
[487:09.06]No.
[487:10.46]I'll play the Surge 2 before I play Nioh 2.
[487:16.04]Fuck, that's harsh.
[487:20.46]Damn, that was harsh.
[487:23.07]What are you going to say, pal?
[487:23.79]If this is the SpongeBob video again, I'm going to be really upset.
[487:26.57]Okay, this is what happens when you eat a shoe.
[487:28.10]This is a
[487:50.60]This is just a weird, creepy 3D video.
[487:55.72]I don't want to watch this.
[487:56.64]This is hurting my... I don't like this video.
[488:12.27]I don't like this video.
[488:13.71]It freaks me out.
[488:15.51]No, I'm not going to eat a shoe.
[488:18.24]I'm going to eat a comedy shoe.
[488:28.66]Same time, same place.
[488:31.24]Saturday.
[488:34.72]See you soon.
[488:35.16]We had one more bit from the Mojo Po.
[488:39.28]Three bucks.
[488:39.78]Binge watched your best of videos when I was in Japan in my hotel room.
[488:43.88]Totally get your sense of humor.
[488:45.76]Please come to a West Coast convention after Corona blows over.
[488:48.52]I want to shake your hand.
[488:52.41]TwitchCon is probably the next thing that I would go to.
[488:55.07]Because obviously E3 has been canceled.
[488:58.99]So that's not really on the table anymore.
[489:02.71]And if TwitchCon is... If this all is under control by then, if they don't have to cancel TwitchCon, that'll be where I go next.
[489:09.40]That'll be where I go.
[489:16.40]But, thank you.
[489:18.28]Um...
[489:20.90]You get it?
[489:21.44]You totally get it.
[489:22.92]Good.
[489:23.46]I'm glad you do.
[489:28.48]I'm happy that you get it.
[489:31.46]Alright.
[489:32.14]So.
[489:33.86]We... Are going to... What are we going to do?
[489:42.74]Are we going to raid somebody?
[489:45.65]Raid.
[489:46.07]Raid.
[489:46.39]Who are we raiding?
[489:48.84]Raid, raid, grump plump.
[489:50.50]He's making frogs.
[489:53.15]Really?
[489:55.23]Wait, what do you mean?
[490:04.76]Frogs and paint and frogs.
[490:07.82]What?
[490:14.58]What is this?
[490:14.98]What are you...
[490:19.93]Is this like clay?
[490:21.67]Holy shit, this is pretty good.
[490:23.43]Wait, Nioh 2 is out?
[490:31.36]Oh no.
[490:34.90]Oh no.
[490:36.10]Wait, Nioh 2 is already out?
[490:38.64]I thought it was coming out in like 2025.
[490:41.76]I'm not playing it.
[490:42.66]My hands are getting sweaty.
[490:48.20]Alright.
[490:49.90]Go say hi to Grump.
[490:57.44]Are you serious?
[491:01.67]Why would I know when Nioh 2 is coming out when I didn't give a shit about Nioh 1?
[491:07.93]I said it.
[491:08.67]I got it off my chest.
[491:10.99]Okay.
[491:11.63]And when you take the Band-Aid off, it feels so much better.
[491:13.55]Okay.
[491:17.56]I respect it, but I don't care.
[491:20.38]Fuck.
[491:20.76]How do I make this better?
[491:21.54]How do I backtrack Barry this?
[491:23.62]There is no backtracking Barry this.
[491:26.88]There's no backtracking Barry on this one.
[491:31.64]Okay.
[491:32.30]He's gonna own it.
[491:32.95]Alright, yeah.
[491:33.89]I wasn't a big fan of Neo.
[491:36.19]Uh, as it looks fun.
[491:39.39]No, don't even forget the backtracking.
[491:41.95]Don't say how to grump.
[491:43.03]She's making frogs.
[491:50.21]Grump Pump is one of our mods here.
[491:55.27]She's also queen of the Discord.
[491:58.89]So, go say hello.
[492:07.50]See you guys later.
[492:07.98]See you tomorrow.
[492:11.32]Have a great night.
[492:14.58]You know, sometimes you just need to look at a frog's butt.
[492:21.96]I think that's all I'm gonna do for Sam.
[492:27.41]Although, hold on.
[492:29.37]I think he's still, like, a little funky.
[492:33.39]So...
