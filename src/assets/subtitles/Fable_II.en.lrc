[00:05.52]What are you guys doing?
[00:09.69]What is this?
[00:10.13]Stop writing that.
[00:14.49]Don't write that.
[00:15.93]What's wrong with you?
[00:19.21]What is this?
[00:19.67]I don't get it.
[00:27.20]It's a penis curse.
[00:28.36]I don't know what that means.
[00:36.36]He doesn't know.
[00:38.33]No, I don't.
[00:39.21]At all.
[00:39.59]I have no idea what you're doing.
[00:44.27]There's a lot of... Wait, is this a chant?
[00:46.87]Are you chanting?
[00:49.40]Yeah, Twitch added copy to clipboard.
[00:54.18]You're chanting.
[00:59.39]You know, for the time that shit goes by too fast, you can't copy it and spam it fast enough.
[01:06.10]In comes chanting.
[01:10.12]Making your life as a Twitch viewer that much more simple.
[01:16.29]Let me tweet this.
[01:16.71]I'll be right back.
[01:17.19]Give me two.
[02:20.82]Okay.
[02:21.36]Hello.
[02:22.90]How are you?
[02:23.24]Today we're going to play Fable 2.
[02:28.42]Or at least start it and play it for a little while.
[02:32.96]I think Fable 2 is like 12 to 16 hours.
[02:36.55]We'll see how far we get in two days.
[02:40.21]I don't know.
[02:44.43]I don't know.
[02:44.71]We might go halfway Andy and I might just get to like 60% of the way through the game and be like, nah, that was fun.
[02:51.23]You forgot the gif.
[02:52.23]I... You guys have to understand, I've said this a bunch of times, but it's very, very accurate.
[02:58.90]I need to make it very clear.
[03:02.04]From the beginning of last stream to the end of last stream, I remembered that stuff like an hour after that stream finished.
[03:10.82]Today, from the beginning of this stream, I don't have any memory of almost anything that happened on the last stream.
[03:20.13]We're in a new period here.
[03:22.39]I'll remember this shit for like the next probably few hours after the stream's over.
[03:25.33]Maybe tomorrow morning.
[03:28.71]I don't... There's too much for me to remember.
[03:36.79]What stream?
[03:37.61]The one from last week.
[03:39.57]I know I played Resident Evil 8.
[03:41.79]I know I did, like, a Wile E. Coyote routine with one of the werewolves.
[03:46.68]I remember the big lady.
[03:47.36]I remember, like, screaming a bunch of times.
[03:50.80]That's it.
[03:54.45]That's pretty much it.
[03:55.41]I don't know anything else.
[03:59.05]Remember, none of that happened.
[04:00.41]None of us are real.
[04:05.73]There is something I do have to tell you, which I'm not necessarily happy with, but next weekend, on Sunday, I have somebody that has been blowing my phone up and I have a contractual obligation, kind of, to let them stream.
[04:26.94]Let me just give it to you long and short.
[04:29.24]They were pissed off that they weren't involved in a stream from last year.
[04:35.53]And I get texts from this person every like six days.
[04:40.01]Hey, is it cool?
[04:42.49]Can I do like my routine?
[04:44.19]I'm like, I...
[04:48.34]no I don't want you I did look you weren't there and the the stream didn't happen so I can't this person just won't leave me alone so I'm gonna give them the opportunity to do a routine for you okay that's next weekend I don't have any idea what the they're gonna do but that's Sunday I don't know if I I would I wouldn't miss it if I were you or maybe I would depends on who you are it depends depends on how you like anybody depends how much you like somebody
[05:18.11]I don't know.
[05:18.67]They're gonna have control and that's it.
[05:20.59]That's all you need to know.
[05:21.53]Sunday.
[05:22.91]Either on Sunday.
[05:23.57]Next Sunday.
[05:24.55]Stream is on Sunday.
[05:25.31]Next Sunday.
[05:25.79]Be there.
[05:27.01]Or don't.
[05:27.31]Ugh.
[05:36.68]Zero viewers?
[05:39.00]I don't... I have no idea.
[05:40.97]I don't want to tell you who it is.
[05:41.89]I'd rather you just get surprised.
[05:44.89]Or not.
[05:46.35]But now we're going to play Fable 2.
[05:47.35]Probably play Fable tomorrow.
[05:48.65]I'm going to do a two day in a row of streams.
[05:54.95]You should stream at the same time.
[05:57.35]I can't.
[05:59.27]Because they were supposed to be on my stream.
[06:04.03]So I can't do that.
[06:08.51]What if Fable sucks?
[06:10.59]You know, if Fable sucks... No, I've played this game before.
[06:14.15]I've played Fable 2.
[06:15.85]I know what I'm getting into.
[06:16.65]Table two.
[06:19.63]Let me just make sure everything works.
[06:23.76]I think this should be fine.
[06:24.84]This game was a lot of fun from what I remember.
[06:26.82]How come I can't hear anything?
[06:30.32]Oh, there we go.
[06:31.98]Okay.
[06:32.92]I got to turn the volume up on my monitor.
[06:36.21]It is far too low.
[06:41.39]There we go.
[06:41.83]Do we have any potions or food?
[06:48.96]That's good.
[06:50.38]So, I'm gonna try... I know that you... Look.
[06:53.96]Like, the streamer thing to do in these games is to get 100% evil points.
[07:01.77]I'm gonna try to be a very good boy.
[07:05.21]I'm not gonna, like, kill anybody.
[07:06.35]I'm not gonna hurt anybody.
[07:07.21]I'm not gonna, like, kick any chickens and stuff and get yelled at.
[07:11.25]No.
[07:12.08]I'm gonna be an extra good boy.
[07:15.28]I'm already seeing resident sleepers.
[07:18.10]Everybody does the- everybody is evil.
[07:19.94]Everybody is like, oh, look at me.
[07:21.14]I'm evil.
[07:21.84]I have horns.
[07:22.94]I'm so bad.
[07:23.90]I'm evil.
[07:24.90]I don't want to be evil.
[07:25.76]I want to be a fucking good person.
[07:27.96]Don't Resident Sleeper that.
[07:28.96]I want to be a good boy.
[07:31.87]You're not going to be able to resist?
[07:38.75]I'm going to try to be a good boy.
[07:40.49]I didn't say I was- Oh, shit.
[07:42.33]I remember this part.
[07:45.35]You remember when I was like a kid?
[07:49.17]Didn't they do the thing like, this is like Link grows up into like Big Link, right?
[07:54.56]So many people tried to copy that shit after they did that.
[07:56.72]Remember that?
[07:57.10]Remember Ocarina of Time?
[07:57.92]It was like, look, you play as like Link and then like you're adult Link.
[08:01.26]Everybody desperately tried to do that too.
[08:06.47]All miserable failures, by the way.
[08:14.23]This dude is ugly.
[08:17.16]Fucking 10 year old.
[08:18.44]What are you talking about?
[08:26.06]What?
[08:34.87]He was talking about you.
[08:35.95]I'm not even on camera.
[08:41.41]This is Hogwarts.
[08:42.21]This is Harry Potter.
[08:43.01]This is Hogwarts.
[08:44.43]The same intro happens.
[08:46.94]Wait, what?
[08:48.00]It is, right?
[08:49.38]The exact same thing happens.
[09:00.73]Nice graphics.
[09:01.61]This game's on an Xbox 360.
[09:03.15]Oh, I have to test to make sure there's no delay.
[09:13.04]That's bird poop that's gonna land on my head, right?
[09:15.70]Someone's gonna lean in and go, oh, there's a chicken chisel in her ears.
[09:19.58]Bird pooped on chicken chisel's head.
[09:21.66]Why's the snow floating around?
[09:30.42]Is this snow or is this, like, fucking ash?
[09:41.49]Use LT to focus on important events.
[09:44.03]It's a volcanic winter.
[09:48.67]I'll end up living there.
[10:08.55]Oh, the town party.
[10:09.73]Follow the glowing trail.
[10:10.49]Oh, yeah.
[10:10.92]I forgot.
[10:12.68]They did.
[10:12.90]Oh, my God.
[10:13.16]This is ugly.
[10:16.66]This is really ugly.
[10:17.62]I forgot.
[10:18.04]Like, 360 looks like shit.
[10:18.98]That's rude.
[10:38.43]All the glowing trail to your next objective.
[10:48.28]I don't remember it looking like this.
[10:49.56]Do I just... Wizard 101.
[11:04.72]Oh, Fuego.
[11:05.98]I remember this.
[11:06.88]I say this on stream all the time.
[11:08.34]The Fuego pieces.
[11:11.30]I say this all the time.
[11:12.33]Yes, I do.
[11:12.81]I've never said it.
[11:13.53]Yes, I have.
[11:16.71]Now, this is truly a Marvel.
[11:32.22]This small, unassuming box is actually a device created by the ancients.
[11:39.08]Prove it.
[11:39.48]Somebody will find it.
[11:41.40]It's only three... Why would I even know that I said that if I didn't say it?
[11:46.50]And you shall be granted a single wish.
[11:51.00]There's no such thing as magic.
[11:53.36]I feel like these look electrified.
[11:56.32]We live in grim times indeed.
[11:58.82]If the young are too world-weary to believe in magic...
[12:02.65]Most children your age believe eagerly.
[12:05.89]Look, I can see your eyes.
[12:07.21]There's too much fucking lit up snow.
[12:09.41]That music box is rubbish.
[12:12.44]That's what the seller thinks.
[12:14.04]He has no idea what he stumbled upon.
[12:16.42]But you have an inkling, don't you?
[12:19.26]Some part of you wants to believe it.
[12:21.04]Why does the snowflakes have bloom on them?
[12:23.06]That seems so bizarre.
[12:24.58]You really think it could be?
[12:28.33]This looks like fucking radioactive.
[12:30.01]You could have your answer.
[12:36.81]Listen to me, Rose.
[12:38.01]At the end of that week, you and your little sparrow would be no closer to your dream, no closer to the inside of that beautiful castle.
[12:45.85]We need five gold pieces.
[12:47.43]I bet we could get five gold pieces.
[12:50.86]And maybe this could be a way out of here after all.
[12:53.92]How does it look for you guys?
[12:54.88]It looks terrible for me.
[12:56.60]It looks awful.
[12:57.28]I'm looking at the OBS monitor.
[13:00.38]It looks better through the OBS monitor than it does on my screen.
[13:03.38]It actually looks better on the preview monitor.
[13:10.87]Okay, I need five gold pieces.
[13:13.99]This is to teach you the morality, right?
[13:19.92]My arrest warrants blew right out of my hands.
[13:23.96]Oh, okay.
[13:24.32]They could be in all corners of Bowerstone by now.
[13:27.51]And I can't leave my post.
[13:30.15]Doesn't look too bad.
[13:30.93]Why don't you find them for me?
[13:32.19]Alright, earn gold by finding the arrest warrants for Albion's most ruthless criminals.
[13:36.14]Sounds fun, right?
[13:38.68]Does it remind me how much I hate this game?
[13:40.38]Nobody hates this game.
[13:44.93]They hate the guy that made this game.
[13:47.67]This game's actually fun.
[13:48.57]Like, kind of.
[13:49.19]Alright, let's go get him.
[13:49.81]Deal.
[14:05.95]Alright, let's go.
[14:06.49]So we're looking for warrants.
[14:08.21]No, it's because of the snow.
[14:09.99]So, we look out for those warrants.
[14:11.97]But for now, let's find some more money.
[14:16.70]This is fine.
[14:17.20]I'll get used to this.
[14:18.96]Oh, thank God there's an imbecile trail.
[14:27.36]Astonish your friends and relatives with a lifelike instant image.
[14:32.21]Alright, let's go.
[14:32.75]Help out Barnum by posing for a picture.
[14:34.63]For one gold piece.
[14:38.01]Now, all you have to do is strike a pose for my little device.
[14:42.19]You'll be positively... The blur is disgusting.
[14:46.86]Be what?
[14:48.78]Ah, yes.
[14:49.30]I've been improving my vocabulary with a wonderful book.
[14:53.46]How come this is not PC?
[14:54.88]That's kind of weird.
[14:56.56]A thesaurus.
[14:59.12]Beer goggles?
[15:00.82]But this could be fun.
[15:06.31]How do I pose?
[15:10.93]I just farted.
[15:11.93]I didn't want to do that.
[15:12.89]I'm supposed to be a good boy.
[15:15.16]Okay.
[15:15.34]Well, I'm already a bad boy.
[15:29.52]Already evil?
[15:33.10]No, not yet.
[15:34.10]Farting isn't evil.
[15:35.06]It's a natural part of your body's ecosystem.
[15:39.73]Imagine thinking farting is evil.
[15:43.09]Alright, we're going to find warrants.
[15:46.39]Ah, this guy might have a warrant.
[15:50.01]Oh, what?
[15:53.67]Why is he glowing?
[15:55.67]Oh, friendly villager.
[15:56.65]Okay.
[16:00.98]Can I go out here?
[16:01.46]I'm gonna turn the game on.
[16:06.45]No, okay.
[16:06.85]Once, like, the snow is gone, everyone will be like, ah, this is fine.
[16:09.39]Alright, what about this way?
[16:12.59]That guy already did that.
[16:13.89]Oh, thank God for the imbecile leader.
[16:15.55]What happened?
[16:18.70]Hey!
[16:18.80]Don't do that.
[16:31.61]Alright, let's kick his ass.
[16:34.79]Hey!
[16:34.93]Oh my god, she just dropped... She's like unconscious.
[16:39.64]I don't remember this part of the game.
[16:40.98]What the fuck?
[16:45.16]Use X to use your wooden sword and... Stop it!
[16:56.04]Let me alone, you nutter!
[17:00.84]Alright, so where's the money?
[17:10.32]Oh wait, that was for free.
[17:13.59]Alright, we're good people.
[17:14.35]We're just a good boy for free.
[17:15.71]What about the dog?
[17:17.03]Is the dog okay?
[17:17.61]How do we help the dog?
[17:20.85]Okay.
[17:27.15]What you need is someone nice to look after you.
[17:30.09]Oh, yeah.
[17:30.51]You get a dog, don't you?
[17:33.93]Oh, we can't keep you.
[17:35.43]We don't have enough food for ourselves.
[17:37.30]I remember this part of the game.
[17:38.16]This is like the best part of the whole game.
[17:39.80]Their very realistic dog.
[17:41.56]I remember, didn't Peter Molyneux make a huge deal about this?
[17:46.56]It was like, the dog.
[17:47.84]We spent 6,000 days animating the dog.
[17:51.19]Glad to be that wreck.
[17:53.39]He deserved it.
[18:00.07]Okay.
[18:00.33]Oh, I got good boy points there.
[18:02.21]I don't want bad boy points.
[18:05.27]Oh, here we go.
[18:07.82]At the dog.
[18:08.38]Alright, what does this do?
[18:13.14]Clear Balthazar's warehouse of beetles or smash his stock.
[18:17.59]What do you mean smash?
[18:19.21]Shoot to kill.
[18:21.25]I can smash his stuff?
[18:22.37]While you're breaking their hateful little heads open, try not to break any of my stuff.
[18:32.56]Alright, so don't break anything?
[18:33.60]What?
[18:36.40]Sir, you are going to have to go through the proper authorities.
[18:40.06]I am not going to do that.
[18:40.62]Certified good boy, Jeremy Elbertson.
[19:02.99]Alright, where are the bugs?
[19:08.08]Why does this kid have a... This is a bit boring.
[19:11.90]Holy shit.
[19:19.33]Smash.
[19:19.87]No!
[19:22.37]How am I supposed to be certified good boy Jeremy Elbertson if I'm... No, I'm not going to break anything.
[19:30.16]We have to have something event happen in our life to create a origin story to be the villain.
[19:37.49]The Joker wasn't the fucking Joker when he was like eight.
[19:41.01]He was a good boy.
[19:41.73]You weren't supposed to kill them.
[19:58.54]Now I think about it, I wonder how those Beatles got in there.
[20:03.02]Yes, he was.
[20:03.62]I watched the cartoon.
[20:05.16]What did you say?
[20:05.84]Did you say the cartoon?
[20:06.74]I didn't know you were so good at fighting.
[20:10.22]And we've got another gold coin.
[20:11.90]We're really doing it.
[20:13.76]You're right, Betty.
[20:14.78]You're always right.
[20:15.42]Here we go.
[20:15.72]More decision making.
[20:16.52]I need two drinks.
[20:18.68]Cover the stolen bottle.
[20:19.62]Where are the warrants?
[20:23.56]So you'll bring me back my bottle?
[20:26.21]Yes.
[20:30.50]Oh, okay.
[20:31.46]So we have to bring the bottle and bring it to this lady.
[20:39.21]Because we're a good boy.
[20:41.75]Oh, hi, dog.
[20:42.21]What'd you find?
[20:44.43]A warrant!
[20:47.41]Nice!
[20:49.33]Nice find!
[20:52.32]Thank you.
[20:53.16]Thank you.
[20:54.06]Oh, I know.
[20:55.24]You're sweet.
[20:56.35]I'm the good boy.
[20:56.97]But I told you before.
[20:58.59]We can't keep you.
[21:00.91]Come on, little sparrow.
[21:04.61]What did we find?
[21:06.10]The warrant!
[21:22.46]Any Carmen Sandiego fans here?
[21:25.14]I guess not.
[21:25.58]Alright, more warrants.
[21:30.52]Press Y?
[21:31.72]No, put the gun down.
[21:33.24]We don't... No, put the sword down and put the gun down.
[21:36.86]Put the gun away.
[21:38.80]Oh my god, my face.
[21:49.57]Put it down.
[21:50.81]No, put... How do I just put it away?
[21:52.73]Is it... I don't know.
[21:53.71]Don't wake him up.
[21:54.83]How do I sneak?
[21:55.43]How do I sneak?
[21:56.09]There is no sneak.
[22:21.02]Run.
[22:21.30]Alright, go return the wine to Pete.
[22:23.88]Alright, we're going to return it to Betty.
[22:25.66]We're a good boy.
[22:26.22]Hard on them.
[22:26.58]Fine.
[22:26.74]I'm a good boy, but I do bad things.
[22:28.14]Is that possible?
[22:48.84]I'll give you a gold piece for it.
[22:52.34]Sounds good to me.
[22:53.28]Wait, what?
[22:54.42]No, don't fall off the wagon.
[22:57.52]Wagon?
[22:58.60]Where?
[22:59.46]Kids, look out for the wagon.
[23:01.25]Does he sound like he needs that?
[23:04.73]Here, I'll give you a gold piece for it.
[23:06.79]So we get a gold piece no matter what, so let's just do the good thing.
[23:10.93]The problem is, you're weak.
[23:12.67]Here, yeah, I'm good.
[23:13.99]Give me the wine.
[23:14.95]Take it.
[23:21.39]I think you guys are misunderstanding this.
[23:25.21]We need to build up a hundred good boy points.
[23:29.13]Do good things.
[23:30.53]So then when I lose a hundred points for drop kicking somebody through a window.
[23:35.53]I'm fine.
[23:36.11]I'm still normal.
[23:37.65]Did you get it?
[23:38.09]I used to be an accountant.
[23:43.71]Don't drink.
[23:44.73]It'll ruin your life.
[23:48.05]I've got three gold pieces.
[23:50.84]Free gold pieces.
[23:51.96]Alright, I think there's more warrants up here.
[23:55.15]Wait, what does it say?
[23:57.95]Reed?
[23:58.21]Brookridge.
[24:04.37]You know what's really important, too?
[24:05.53]We have to decide.
[24:06.21]I'm going to have to do a poll.
[24:09.19]Because we have to pick, right?
[24:10.09]Like melee, ranged, or magic?
[24:15.48]Melee, ranged, or magic.
[24:16.52]It's a big decision.
[24:23.34]Magic, magic, magic, magic.
[24:25.28]Ranged, ranged, ranged, ranged.
[24:28.38]Let's go back to the garden.
[24:31.34]Mealy, mealy, mealy, mealy, mealy.
[24:35.06]Hey, kids.
[24:37.13]Oh, cool.
[24:37.71]Fart party.
[24:40.75]Why can't I do it?
[24:44.07]How come I can't do it?
[24:44.85]I could show all these kids who has the biggest farts.
[24:48.79]Alright, I'm leaving.
[24:50.86]How come I can't do it?
[25:07.03]Shut it girl.
[25:08.05]This isn't about that Those warrants you're collecting.
[25:12.43]I want oh really So does our friend the guard Yeah, but you're gonna give up to me.
[25:19.59]See I'm just gonna pop this guy.
[25:21.29]Otherwise, there'll be trouble.
[25:22.77]Oh
[25:24.15]Well, yeah, a nice premium you're paying me.
[25:26.51]One gold piece?
[25:26.93]You pay me a three gold piece premium to even consider this shit.
[25:30.35]Get the fuck out of here.
[25:48.62]Do you not understand crime?
[25:50.31]Like, you don't understand how this works?
[25:51.63]I would have considered it for three or four gold pieces.
[25:53.45]You're going to give me the same that I would get for bringing it to the guard?
[25:57.31]Do you even understand fucking crime?
[25:58.55]My empire begins now.
[26:02.34]Thanks.
[26:03.54]You're a lifesaver.
[26:06.18]Now, normally, justice is its own reward.
[26:09.32]But as these aren't normal circumstances, here's your gold piece.
[26:14.16]Okay, I need one more.
[26:14.81]Let's pick my nose.
[26:22.25]What is this?
[26:22.59]What are we doing here?
[26:26.15]He's an evil good boy.
[26:31.55]Unlike the spectrum of good, bad, like evil, does evil things, does good things.
[26:40.65]I just want us to be just orbiting around in a circle around that whole spectrum.
[26:44.82]Magic?
[26:51.58]71% magic.
[26:52.30]What the fuck?
[26:57.84]Speak to Monty.
[27:02.50]Are you an anti-hero or an anti-villain?
[27:09.76]Yes.
[27:14.58]Looks to me like you fancy the girl who lives there, but her mum thinks you're rubbish, so she's locked her away.
[27:22.48]I suppose that's the gist of it.
[27:24.24]Why'd you ask me then?
[27:26.62]Maybe we could help you.
[27:28.20]Hyperactive good boy with villainous tendencies.
[27:31.37]Where's that one?
[27:33.77]Oh, there is hope.
[27:35.41]You know who it would be?
[27:37.71]I would be Loki from Marvel.
[27:39.79]That's who I want to be.
[27:44.13]I'm a bit strapped right at the moment.
[27:48.56]But Belinda's good for it.
[27:50.38]I'm sure she'll pay you when she receives my letter.
[27:54.83]Alright, deliver the letter to Monty's beloved.
[27:56.79]Let's do it.
[28:01.59]Give us the money.
[28:02.25]Get that letter straight to Belinda.
[28:04.11]Don't let her mom get it.
[28:05.99]Don't let her mom get it.
[28:07.10]Oh, wait.
[28:07.52]Okay, so let's just give it right to the mom?
[28:11.74]What's the good thing to do here?
[28:13.58]Deliver it to mom.
[28:14.34]Just say, hey, there's like this guy outside.
[28:15.86]What do you think?
[28:20.56]Is that James Corden?
[28:24.14]I don't know.
[28:24.48]I don't, I like didn't know who that was until I had to think about it for a second.
[28:29.57]And thinking about it for more than two seconds, I just saw in my brain, like a profile shot of him in a car, like bouncing around, like singing a song with like his hands on the wheel.
[28:39.21]And then I'm like, oh, okay.
[28:40.26]Now I know who the fuck that is.
[28:41.24]Knock on the door and let's see your answers.
[28:48.00]What do you want?
[28:50.19]Oh, um, we've got a letter.
[28:52.80]We need one gold for the postage.
[28:55.28]Kath, there's more than one British person.
[28:57.22]Why did you say so?
[28:59.90]Come on in.
[29:02.86]There is more than one British person on Earth, yes.
[29:06.19]Wait there while I get the money.
[29:08.89]And don't you touch anything.
[29:10.57]Okay, I'm a good person that does bad things sometimes, right?
[29:13.97]Monty told us not to give it to the mother.
[29:17.18]We shall pay us if we just wait here.
[29:19.95]What's the good thing?
[29:20.77]I don't know what's good.
[29:21.47]What's easiest?
[29:21.99]Letting the mother have it would be easiest.
[29:23.45]We'd be ready...
[29:39.81]Look, I have a letter for you, but it's going to require one specific thing.
[29:43.01]I'm going to need one gold coin and two of your finest pieces of jewelry you have in the house.
[29:51.52]This is how crime works, okay?
[29:53.64]Do I need to explain it to you?
[29:54.48]Okay.
[30:03.03]Oh, Monty.
[30:04.73]My little dove.
[30:06.11]Shouldn't I be in school?
[30:07.11]I don't know.
[30:07.67]Was there school back in like... I guess some people's wishes do come true.
[30:11.13]In like the 1500s?
[30:12.81]Did people... Did kids go to school in like the 1400s?
[30:14.83]We did it.
[30:16.35]We can buy the music box now.
[30:18.11]I don't think so.
[30:25.29]No.
[30:25.65]When did... Okay, when was the first school?
[30:27.69]Oh, I'm missing like the important stuff.
[30:31.45]Hold on.
[30:31.87]Watch out.
[30:35.53]Oh, wait.
[30:36.29]I can... Rude.
[30:37.43]Point and laugh.
[30:39.51]Social.
[30:39.95]Okay.
[30:40.13]Thumbs up.
[31:08.57]Oh, look at me.
[31:09.17]What am I doing?
[31:09.67]What was that?
[31:10.09]What is scary?
[31:10.77]Bloodlust?
[31:39.31]Where did this kid come from?
[31:40.41]Why is there a kid in here?
[31:42.11]No, I'm good.
[31:42.82]I just do bad things.
[31:49.70]It's scaring this kid.
[31:50.80]Alright, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[31:58.65]Time to leave, leave, leave.
[32:00.71]I was just trying to scare a kid.
[32:08.20]Art on the kid, no.
[32:12.98]Alright, let's buy the music box for flagal faces.
[32:18.08]Okay.
[32:18.64]24th and 23rd century BC established the first school, okay.
[32:48.10]Press Y when getting an item in the description.
[32:50.02]Oh, a chicken.
[32:50.48]I didn't want to do that.
[32:51.82]I wanted to like pet.
[32:52.74]I just pressed A. I did not know it was going to kick the chicken.
[32:56.19]I already ruined it.
[33:06.83]Alright, let's use it.
[33:15.20]Oh, make a portal to another dimension.
[33:18.95]Or whatever this does.
[33:29.97]Right now the production company's splash screen comes up.
[33:33.36]Where did it go?
[33:34.02]The black screen.
[33:35.86]Why are we still here?
[33:38.84]Five gold pieces.
[33:41.68]Let's just go to bed.
[33:44.06]What?
[33:44.26]Oh, the dog.
[33:45.00]Well, I'm glad the box didn't take us because... Ruff, um... Ruff.
[33:48.52]Dr. Ruff.
[34:14.40]R-U-F-F.
[34:15.08]That's Dr. Ruff PhD.
[34:18.66]Okay.
[34:24.32]We're gonna have like a dream or something.
[34:28.61]Alright, settle down.
[34:30.21]There's a nice angry stray dog.
[34:35.19]Quiet, boy.
[34:37.37]What you want?
[34:39.46]I work for Lord Lucian, miss.
[34:41.92]And he would very much like to see you in his castle.
[34:46.58]I've been sent to collect you.
[34:48.38]Who's this kid?
[34:54.15]It did work.
[34:55.55]I wish came true.
[34:56.87]Wait, did I teach this kid how to do weird things?
[34:59.35]Why is this kid in the house?
[35:03.95]It's alright, doggy.
[35:05.27]Why is this kid here?
[35:10.78]Is this a party member?
[35:15.42]Alright, well, cool.
[35:17.34]Thanks, kid.
[35:17.82]Does Dark shit on him?
[35:20.06]Wait, what's that?
[35:24.54]I can't... Oh, here we go.
[35:34.37]Oh, he hates me.
[35:37.35]Well, what are you going to do about it?
[35:46.24]Get out of here.
[35:46.86]Get out of my house.
[35:59.67]It took a while for his AI to figure out what I wanted to do there.
[36:02.63]Alright, let's go.
[36:03.87]Oh, wait a minute.
[36:10.90]You're coming to get us.
[36:11.94]Go to Castle Fairfax.
[36:16.02]Hold on to the emote.
[36:16.82]Let's go to the castle.
[36:24.08]See, why did anyone like this game?
[36:25.56]I mean, this game 15 years ago was pretty good.
[36:28.40]Okay.
[36:28.50]Okay.
[36:37.84]Evening, Javes.
[36:39.38]Here are the children Lord Lucian asked for.
[36:42.00]Yeah, we're very like special children, right?
[36:46.00]Hello, young masters.
[36:49.00]Hello, sir.
[36:51.04]If you'd follow me, please.
[36:54.00]We look up at this castle every day and think how nice it is.
[36:57.63]We both do.
[36:59.65]But inside... Okay, I can't fart.
[37:01.21]Sorry.
[37:01.37]It is quite wonderful, isn't it?
[37:09.50]This is the best fable?
[37:10.66]I think that's accurate.
[37:14.31]Why is there still... Bro, you're playing on an Xbox?
[37:15.83]Yeah, Xbox 360.
[37:16.23]Oh, I know the whole story.
[37:17.35]I forgot.
[37:18.47]You don't even care if I spoil the whole game?
[37:19.95]Yes, he misses them terribly.
[37:38.28]so where does he eat okay alright I won't actually he takes most of his meals in his study he's in there working all hours doing research alright alright yeah and history mostly lord lucian is quite keen on antiquities of all sorts but he's chiefly interested in things relating to the old kingdom there was a trader in old town he said his stuff was from the old kingdom
[38:04.24]Yes, yes.
[38:05.79]I believe Lord Lucian heard about that.
[38:09.93]We bought a piece of it, and we made a wish, and now we're here.
[38:13.09]That's wonderful.
[38:15.51]Now, when you meet Lord Lucian, you must show respect at all times.
[38:20.28]This is just the Minecraft sword from, like, the 1200s.
[38:22.92]And do not mention Lady Fairfax or Amelia.
[38:35.73]Alright, well, let's go.
[38:36.29]Let me in.
[38:36.71]Hello.
[38:36.87]Oh, he's evil, right?
[38:38.01]What was your wish?
[38:39.11]Exactly.
[38:39.47]After you used it.
[39:06.91]Yeah, the sideburns are like Pinocchio for evil people.
[39:18.36]The bigger your sideburns, the more evil you really are.
[39:20.74]If they're like an inch down, like I write, you're kind of a dick.
[39:24.28]This far, this guy is a fucking horrible person.
[39:28.72]Like this guy is an awful tyrant that has probably killed thousands of people.
[39:34.07]I'm working to rebuild... Well, I'm working on something wonderful for which I need individuals with particular talents.
[39:44.64]Let us find out... If you're bald, you're good?
[39:47.40]Would you kindly stand in the circle, please?
[39:50.50]Would you kindly?
[39:51.89]I'll do it.
[39:52.27]He said it.
[39:52.65]He said the thing.
[39:53.35]I promise it won't hurt you.
[39:58.99]Alright.
[39:59.33]Well, no.
[39:59.53]Oh, yeah.
[39:59.69]Right.
[39:59.83]This is like a...
[40:07.47]You want me to get on there too?
[40:25.70]Like this guy's eyeing me from across the bar.
[40:28.11]You know what I mean?
[40:28.65]Like what did I do?
[40:29.93]Why does this guy fucking hate me?
[40:31.67]What's going on?
[40:34.81]What did I do?
[40:49.34]Your blood.
[40:50.76]You are a hero.
[40:52.00]No, we're junior heroes.
[40:54.51]He may like any old stories.
[41:02.87]Oh, come on.
[41:04.87]Come on.
[41:05.55]That's Donald Duck from fucking Kingdom Hearts.
[41:08.17]Get out of here.
[41:09.39]I give myself a +2.
[41:10.19]I don't care.
[41:11.19]What happened?
[41:12.36]What's that light?
[41:15.26]Quiet.
[41:16.86]You're heroes, but you're not any of the three.
[41:20.07]Run.
[41:20.21]Get down, sis!
[41:20.65]I couldn't stand in front of her.
[41:50.10]You just shot like a little kid.
[42:07.25]I'm sure there was some other way to handle this.
[42:19.86]Hey, thanks for letting us go get a fucking music box and my sister gets shot and I get thrown out of a window.
[42:30.19]Thanks, lady.
[42:40.40]A thousand foot drop.
[42:41.32]Yeah, I hit my head on the side of a building, too.
[42:43.34]There's no way I survived that.
[42:52.31]Lucian disappeared from Castle Fairfax that night, certain that those who might stand in his way were dead.
[42:58.75]But some grief is so great, even death may keep its distance.
[43:03.27]And so the boy survived.
[43:05.39]Days later, far from the dark alleys of Bowerstone, life slowly returned to his small broken body.
[43:12.15]The boy awoke to a familiar face watching over a strange bed.
[43:16.39]He reached out for the comfort of the dog's warm fur.
[43:19.50]Yeah, that was an interesting thing to get right after that cutscene.
[43:23.64]Oh, like a little girl gets shot and you get thrown out of the window and like die.
[43:28.20]Be careful not to hold the fart button down or you'll shit your pants.
[43:31.48]Not really an appropriate place for that tip, I don't think.
[43:34.94]Right.
[43:35.06]Many years ago, I promised I would help you avenge your sister's death.
[43:57.59]Oh, nice.
[43:58.00]Is this where I get to learn magic?
[44:23.59]I can't wait.
[44:24.05]I'm going to start to learn the fire spell, the ice spell, the wind spell, the lightning spell.
[44:34.86]Oh, can't you buy stuff?
[44:37.12]You can buy this house.
[44:38.10]Once you own it, you can choose to live there and receive special bonuses or rent it out to anyone.
[44:41.78]Oh, wow.
[44:44.02]How much do I have now?
[44:52.61]Make sure you put your house up for rent before you leave.
[44:55.87]Oh, shit.
[44:56.33]Okay.
[45:00.81]I don't have any weapons.
[45:02.13]Where's my house?
[45:11.04]Buy and move in.
[45:12.02]Buy and rent out.
[45:12.88]How much money do I have?
[45:13.54]I have zero dollars.
[45:14.74]I don't have any money.
[45:21.40]Yeah, get his name right.
[45:22.29]That's Dr. Rough PhD.
[45:24.43]Turn safety off?
[45:26.13]What?
[45:26.35]Do I have a gun?
[45:27.63]What does that mean?
[45:29.17]Turn safety off?
[45:30.91]He traced the aroma to the mouth of a cave.
[45:56.15]What was that?
[45:59.15]Was that a secondary fart?
[46:01.96]Your actions have affected your purity.
[46:03.68]What?
[46:03.82]What do you mean my purity?
[46:08.10]What?
[46:08.20]I'm no longer pure?
[46:08.74]Buy items.
[46:09.16]I don't have any money.
[46:10.42]Someone has just tried flirting with you.
[46:21.19]Why not try flirting back?
[46:23.87]Who?
[46:25.88]What is flirt?
[46:27.88]You got the attention of somebody.
[46:28.96]Everyone wants to have my attention.
[46:30.74]Alright, how about um... Who likes me?
[46:43.23]You like that?
[46:43.71]What do you know?
[46:49.95]Do I just keep doing this?
[46:51.59]Everybody loves me.
[46:52.67]Alright, I don't want to do this yet.
[46:59.65]The villager is attracted to you.
[47:00.79]You can use flirty, fun, and social expressions to make them like you.
[47:04.57]Maybe even marry you.
[47:08.71]Okay, don't you think that's a little quick?
[47:12.14]I just woke up in the town and I'm going to have a wife immediately?
[47:20.79]You and I are now, we're in love.
[47:23.63]Oh, by the way, get you a man that can do this.
[47:26.17]I mean, are we gonna get married?
[47:45.84]It's too, it's so early.
[47:47.22]It's so early for this.
[47:50.84]I don't even know what this person is.
[47:53.15]Are we married?
[47:54.59]Nice.
[47:55.55]That's pretty good.
[47:58.49]Nice.
[47:59.39]I can get to like that.
[48:00.89]That's well done.
[48:03.85]The world is a big place.
[48:05.75]Wonderful.
[48:12.21]okay so what is it time now what happens okay I think somebody's in love with me okay um
[48:32.23]Heroic pickup line.
[48:33.19]Here we go.
[48:33.73]Okay.
[48:34.63]Now what?
[48:35.05]Turn safety off and start swinging at everybody.
[48:39.37]No.
[48:48.19]Everybody hates me here?
[48:52.43]Wait, why does everybody hate me?
[48:53.43]Everybody's supposed to love me.
[48:54.87]Okay, so let's get me out of here.
[48:58.40]Now what do I do?
[48:59.64]Give gift.
[49:00.06]You have no items.
[49:01.04]A birthday?
[49:24.66]Oh god, that's disgusting.
[49:27.70]What am I doing in public?
[49:30.96]What am I doing?
[49:50.58]Yeah!
[49:51.29]I have to leave.
[49:55.11]I need to like do a mission or something.
[49:56.56]What the fuck am I doing?
[49:58.92]You are loved by enough people to be Albion's dumpling?
[50:05.53]What?
[50:06.05]Oh, plus 34 hate.
[50:07.21]What?
[50:07.45]Albion's dump truck.
[50:08.51]Alright, I have to get out of here.
[50:10.23]Somebody just said I'm gonna puke.
[50:13.56]I'm gonna puke.
[50:41.93]Alright, I'm gonna leave.
[50:43.33]Goodbye.
[50:43.69]It was really fun.
[50:45.07]Now, I've... What?
[50:47.07]Press down to use the follow expression.
[50:48.80]To lead villagers to places they like.
[50:51.08]Oh, shit.

[50:57.32]Okay.
[51:00.06]Alright, let's go.
[51:00.60]Let's go.
[51:00.93]Where are we going?
[51:02.37]I don't have any items.
[51:06.23]Into a bed.
[51:07.41]Oh, shit.
[51:07.81]Okay.
[51:08.69]Where's my bed?
[51:09.73]Do I have a bed?

[51:36.87]Oh, that's a nice bed you've got.
[51:55.92]Wait, I can't.
[51:56.36]I don't think I can do this.
[52:06.04]This villager wants to marry you.
[52:17.84]I thought that said rest for 20.
[52:19.36]Rest for 7 days.
[52:20.90]Oh my god.
[52:23.54]That's too much.
[52:25.91]Hold on.
[52:27.33]Wait, wait.
[52:32.99]I need to get my items.
[52:37.58]I need a ring.
[52:38.28]It's like 10 million dollars for a ring.
[52:47.74]Okay, rusty long sword.
[52:48.86]I'll use it.
[52:50.56]I'll use it.
[52:52.72]Uh, take it.
[52:54.54]Dog elixir?
[52:55.44]Caller of holding.
[52:57.54]A spade.
[52:59.00]Okay.
[53:00.58]Okay.
[53:06.65]STD speedrun?
[53:13.27]Don't, no.
[53:13.93]Wait, you can, you can, that can happen?
[53:17.97]That doesn't happen, right?
[53:22.89]Someone just tried flirting with you.
[53:24.67]Is this the same person?
[53:32.89]No, this is different.

[54:16.37]Yes.
[54:21.39]Cool.
[54:21.65]Alright.
[54:27.89]Whoa.
[54:28.03]You got a gift?
[54:28.70]Give someone a gift.
[54:42.01]Call her.
[54:46.37]I gotta get out of here.
[54:50.89]I gotta get out of here.
[54:52.59]I'm getting out of here.
[54:53.45]I'm gonna do the mission.
[54:57.04]I'm gonna do the mission.
[54:57.88]No, everyone get away from me.
[55:00.82]No, I'm not giving anybody a collar.
[55:04.30]The villager wants to marry you?
[55:06.42]Not yet.
[55:07.40]Let me do like a mission first.
[55:08.74]Now come with me.
[55:11.89]Why are we walking so slow?
[55:27.96]She's still- she's still following me.
[55:32.56]Our lake tomb seal.
[55:34.72]It is a powerful artifact, the kind of which all heroes once carried.
[55:39.24]It will grant you access to places others cannot go.
[55:42.96]Are you going to keep following me?
[55:45.32]Now, look down towards the lake.
[55:51.64]The seal will allow you to enter.
[55:52.96]In its darkest depths lies the chamber of fate.
[55:59.23]When you come out again, you will be stronger.
[56:01.85]Much stronger.
[56:06.81]Okay.
[56:08.03]Enter Bower Lake Tomb.
[56:14.29]Sword out.
[56:16.33]Shotgun out.
[56:18.92]Big spot?
[56:21.10]Oh, cool.
[56:21.42]Nice.
[56:21.60]Alright, let's dig.
[56:24.88]Give the dog the collar.
[56:25.92]What'd I get?
[56:31.40]A rubber ball.
[56:35.42]You can find books that will train your dog to find even more valuable hidden treasures.
[56:38.58]Alright, you want to play with the ball?
[56:41.48]You want me to throw the ball, I think.
[56:43.78]While near your dog, you can throw the ball.
[56:45.32]Alright, come here.
[56:48.49]Let's do it.
[56:50.65]You ready?
[56:50.93]Here we go.
[56:56.19]Go get it!
[57:00.31]Go get it!
[57:04.73]What?
[57:06.99]Go get the ball!
[57:09.11]No, alright.
[57:13.85]I'll throw it this way.
[57:14.99]Go get it this way.
[57:16.91]Come on.
[57:18.87]Come on, I want to throw it for you.
[57:20.29]Come here.
[57:21.99]You threw it off a cliff.
[57:22.95]He just dives.
[57:27.96]You threw it off a cliff.
[57:28.66]Alright, well, how about this time?
[57:31.08]Oh, the jump is safe.
[57:31.82]Okay, alright, come here.
[57:32.36]I'm not going to throw it that far.
[57:38.40]Ready?
[57:38.64]Go get it.
[57:43.24]Get it.
[57:45.38]Go get it.
[57:45.74]Did you get it?
[57:50.48]You're kind of stupid.
[57:52.10]It's like right there.
[57:55.47]Go get it.
[58:07.69]How many balls do I have?
[58:09.27]That was such a good job.
[58:12.85]Let's go.
[58:19.04]What'd you find?
[58:20.26]Treasure?
[58:20.56]Oh my god, you found a treasure.
[58:34.34]It is a jet.
[58:36.56]Nice job.
[58:37.56]Good job.
[58:38.72]Good boy.
[58:41.30]Good dog.
[58:43.62]Such a good dog.
[58:44.56]You did such a good dog.
[58:45.76]Can dogs swim?
[58:50.56]Alright, let's go.
[59:00.74]I love that dog.
[59:09.56]Is there like a aim?
[59:13.50]Oops.
[59:13.78]Okay.
[59:19.89]You called him dumb?
[59:21.71]I mean, I said he was kind of dumb.
[59:25.05]I didn't say he's dumb, therefore I hate this dog.
[59:27.35]I said he's a little dumb.
[59:28.61]It's okay.
[59:35.52]He's a doctor.
[59:37.16]So...
[59:41.02]Find the chamber of fate.
[59:42.12]He's scared.
[59:45.40]It's okay.
[59:45.76]This dog is- This is a dumb doctor.
[59:47.08]We both have- We all have to go in here, right?
[59:49.83]Alright, let's go in.
[59:50.79]Let's go!
[60:14.86]Where is he?
[60:20.12]Oh shit.
[60:20.90]Uh oh.
[60:33.49]Time for the first battle of the game.
[60:35.19]Besides that kid.
[60:36.01]Oh.
[60:38.83]Oh.
[60:44.67]That was sick.
[60:46.71]Lock onto your target.
[60:47.97]Tap left or right to change which target you're going to focus on.
[60:57.22]You can attack any object or person that glows red.
[60:59.32]Yes, you can.
[61:01.96]Those poor beetles.
[61:03.70]Oh, that's right.
[61:06.70]I forgot about this.
[61:07.98]You have to kill things with a certain specialty to get experience for that specialty.
[61:12.36]I remember now.
[61:13.27]I get it.
[61:15.86]Yep, I remember.
[61:18.16]Use magic?
[61:19.08]I don't have any magic.
[61:28.22]It's like Warframe.
[61:31.42]Silver key.
[61:32.18]Look at the dog.
[61:32.92]I love it.
[61:39.81]Is that Warframe was?
[61:41.13]Warframe?
[61:41.99]Warframe.
[61:42.59]Sorry.
[61:51.38]Look at my health bar.
[61:52.26]It's so small.
[61:54.86]That's ridiculously small.
[61:56.22]That's a joke.
[61:56.78]It's like I died 15 times in a row in Dark Souls.
[62:11.61]Easy.
[62:17.81]It's a baby health bar.
[62:19.17]It is tiny.
[62:20.19]That's so small.
[62:22.43]That's just stupidly small.
[62:27.13]Anything in here?
[62:27.55]No.
[62:34.50]Quite a small health bar you have here.
[62:36.64]Yeah, it is.
[62:38.56]You can definitely be inqueased, though.
[62:39.92]Don't worry.
[62:48.23]If I remember, melee was actually pretty fun in these games, wasn't it?
[62:51.40]Don't you have to string together combos?
[63:03.41]Yes, you do.
[63:04.27]Be sure to explore the world around you.
[63:05.63]Following the glowing trail is extremely useful, but there's so much to find off the beaten path.
[63:09.63]We're exploring all the corners of this cavern.
[63:12.95]Why?
[63:13.21]Is there going to be something for me?
[63:17.58]It's the bones.
[63:19.55]Oh no, maybe it's time to make use of the poison.
[63:22.63]Oh shit.
[63:22.81]Not Aaron, Eric.
[63:53.64]my head on that.
[63:59.92]No, everybody hates that.
[64:04.99]Eric's letter.
[64:09.11]Doom will be rich.
[64:10.71]Whatever.
[64:16.32]There's not very many people that like the errand.
[64:24.27]Oh, wait, can I go up?
[64:24.93]Can I get up there?
[64:33.00]Nope.
[64:39.82]How am I supposed to use magic if I don't have magic?
[64:43.28]Do I get blessed at some point here in a minute?
[64:52.77]I hate Attack on Titan so much.
[64:58.86]I'm sorry to hear that.
[64:59.82]I don't know.
[65:13.93]Range weapon.
[65:18.16]I like the ranged.
[65:20.56]I really like the range, though, guys.
[65:21.92]You just ignored that guy?
[65:25.11]No, I... Okay, I've seen Attack on Titan.
[65:35.43]I got through the first, like, five episodes, and I was just like... It was just like... It was just too much for me.
[65:42.85]I was just like, this... I can't do this.
[65:56.19]Liar.
[66:09.03]Outstanding fight.
[66:10.45]Thanks.
[66:11.69]You watched it till 3 a.m.
[66:13.47]You don't know anything about what I've done.
[66:22.96]Please watch anything but Attack on Titan.
[66:34.24]What is that?
[66:34.66]What is that?
[66:35.84]What's that from?
[66:36.28]That's from something.
[66:39.04]What is that?
[66:49.06]What is that?
[66:54.62]Is he serious?
[66:55.46]I feel like I've heard that somewhere.
[66:57.08]That like...
[66:59.35]It's not, no, no, no, not the song.
[67:01.01]I know, like, the dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[67:03.23]I'm talking about, like, the Zuzu Zuz.
[67:06.00]It's from Jimmy Neutron?
[67:16.00]Guy, okay, listen, listen, listen, listen.
[67:17.40]I gotta clear this up.
[67:18.99]I know that this... That's like the intro to the first season.
[67:25.21]I'm talking about not the tune I was doing.
[67:28.01]I'm talking about the Zuzu's.
[67:30.53]That's from something weird.
[67:32.83]I can't put my finger on it.
[67:33.82]What is tune?
[67:34.72]It's Jimmy Neutron.
[67:35.74]What is...
[67:52.42]It's a French song from the 80s?
[67:54.38]What?
[67:54.60]Ooh, 150 gold pieces.
[68:06.21]I think it's a random noise that you just thought of.
[68:11.87]Yeah, maybe.
[68:13.05]The Hero of Oakvale.
[68:23.02]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
[68:33.34]No, it's real.
[68:35.55]Ooh, a mood ring!
[68:36.35]Alright, I have a ring.
[68:41.41]I can get married.
[68:45.41]It's from Augie and the Cockroaches?
[68:49.64]You just made that show up.
[68:51.94]You made that up.
[68:59.20]That's not a real thing.
[69:00.21]Okay.
[69:14.84]I've never heard of that show.
[69:15.67]For centuries, this academy trained the most supremely gifted sons and daughters of Albion, bound together by the blood that flowed in their veins.
[69:24.55]Once worshipped by the people of Albion, the great heroes came to be feared and hated.
[69:30.13]No man alive today remembers the night the guild burned, and now it lies forgotten.
[69:36.86]But the heroes are not all gone.
[69:39.36]You are here, and that same heroic blood flows through you.
[69:46.70]Your forebear.
[69:47.98]One of the mightiest heroes who ever lived.
[69:50.94]At a young age, he suffered a devastating loss.
[69:53.78]From which, he never... It is alert, alert, alert.
[69:56.08]Hold on.
[69:56.69]But when the world tried to crush him, he fought back.
[70:00.27]He grew strong.
[70:01.59]Strong enough to reshape the world as he saw fit.
[70:05.03]You must do the same.
[70:06.09]I said, y'all are weird as fuck.
[70:07.49]The guild has reacted to you.
[70:10.59]Step into the light.
[70:12.23]Learn the true power of you.
[70:13.25]Y'all are weird as fuck.
[70:22.13]There's no more links allowed what mods gonna have to do it to strength skill or will strength improves combat with hand-to-hand weapons
[70:40.99]skill allows you to shoot faster and with greater accuracy will gives you control over the forces of magic buggy and the cockroaches intro okay hold on it reacts to the will yeah yeah I guess strength agility you have not been able to use will yet but the simple act of reaching this place has given you will experience you need to learn a will ability to activate the colors gate alright is this it
[71:30.13]Where's this?
[71:30.96]I don't hear it.
[71:31.74]That's not what I was... That's not what I was doing.
[71:57.63]How would you even know that?
[71:59.01]I don't even know.
[72:00.13]How would you even remember this?
[72:02.81]There's no way you could even remember that shit.
[72:06.81]Fuck, it is that, but that's not it.
[72:13.24]That's so funny.
[72:14.60]You should buy a will ability so that you can activate that color's gate.
[72:18.46]I can't.
[72:20.43]Oh, sorry.
[72:21.87]I'm sorry.
[72:22.49]Hold on.
[72:28.18]Okay.
[72:29.77]No, I don't want to throw the ball to the dog.
[72:38.69]No, don't.
[72:39.77]Alright, will.
[72:40.41]Shock.
[72:40.55]Inferno.
[72:40.81]Time control.
[72:41.23]Blades.
[72:41.51]Oh, hold on.
[72:41.99]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[72:43.27]Okay.
[72:43.57]Area damage, target damage.
[72:45.89]Inferno.
[73:04.96]Inferno calls forth magical flames to scorch and burn your foes.
[73:09.70]That's from Frasier.
[73:13.20]No, that's not from Frasier.
[73:16.38]In the Frasier intro, he doesn't go... It's... He actually talks.
[73:29.77]It's like a song.
[73:30.39]He's like, oh, you know, I want to have that breakfast with those scrambled eggs.
[73:36.97]He doesn't say like Zuzu Zuzu.
[73:43.72]Time control allows you to slow the world around you or to move with incredible speed.
[73:49.06]I like this one.
[73:53.74]This one's cool.
[74:02.32]I like that.
[74:02.72]Okay, Vortex.
[74:04.92]Vortex creates a powerful windstorm that will pummel your enemies.
[74:08.32]Ooh, alright, this one's good too.
[74:13.56]Vortex, Chaos.
[74:15.80]Chaos confuses your foes, making them unpredictable.
[74:19.07]They may flee, attack their fellows, or even fall in love with you.
[74:22.17]I think I want Chaos.
[74:27.16]Force push sends a blast of energy towards your enemies, hurling them into nearby objects.
[74:33.03]It is very effective in confined spaces.
[74:35.13]Raise the dead.
[74:36.17]Raise dead causes the bones of the recently deceased to rise and fight for you.
[74:43.01]Okay, that's cool.
[74:45.25]I think I want chaos.
[74:48.22]Chaos confuses your foes, making them unpredictable.
[74:51.48]They may flee, attack their fellows, or even fall in love with you.
[74:55.98]No, do lightning.
[74:56.76]No, I'm doing chaos.
[74:59.18]What?
[75:00.94]Oh, I don't have enough.
[75:05.38]I can only do shock or inferno, and we're doing shock.
[75:07.62]Okay, shock.
[75:09.53]Wait, abilities.
[75:10.37]Abilities.
[75:24.36]Strength, okay.
[75:25.30]Brutal styles, physique, toughness.
[75:30.04]Blocking?
[75:31.14]You still have a shit in your pants.
[75:40.07]Yes, and I had unprotected sex with a big dump in my underwear.
[75:46.21]When you want to get gross, go ahead.
[75:51.03]Physique is just HP, right?
[75:53.13]No, it's toughness.
[75:53.67]I don't have to do anything.
[75:55.59]I can do this one.
[75:56.30]Brutal Styles.
[75:56.82]Block.
[75:57.06]You can now hold down X to block enemy's melee attacks.
[76:00.34]Alright, let's go.
[76:17.54]Alright, so now I have my skill.
[76:19.32]Again.
[76:19.56]Power up.
[76:19.84]Flip the switch.
[76:20.58]Whoa.
[76:21.00]Come on, this is Chester.
[76:45.03]Go to www.fable2.com to add access to golden items.
[76:50.03]What is this?
[76:50.54]A fucking ad?
[76:51.30]Power up!
[77:02.50]Oh, voice crack.
[77:04.78]Too much power in my hands.
[77:05.95]Not enough power going to my vocal cords.
[77:08.87]That's understandable.
[77:24.00]Okay.
[77:25.68]Damn, that was embarrassing, dude.
[77:27.50]No, it's alright.
[77:28.12]Did you see how much lightning I shot out of my hand?
[77:37.33]Alright.
[77:45.91]I've never done magic in Fable, but wow, this is pretty good.
[77:48.75]Wow.
[77:50.07]Wow.
[77:57.56]That's pretty good.
[78:00.22]Cool, alright.
[78:06.92]I did it.
[78:08.86]Seven dollars income?
[78:09.98]Oh, somebody's renting the house.
[78:10.92]That's not very much money.
[78:13.52]Can I die if I jump off this?
[78:21.41]Unlimited power!
[78:25.47]Is there mana?
[78:29.37]I guess there's no mana.
[78:37.28]Pretending?
[78:37.82]Wait, what?
[78:38.16]Oh, shit.
[78:49.80]Wait, what?
[78:52.53]Reload?
[78:56.38]How come everyone said I was... Wait, because I didn't... I thought somebody said I could right trigger?
[79:00.80]No, I think these are just glitched out from old right trigger.
[79:06.54]Yeah.
[79:06.90]No, I can't pick these up.
[79:11.33]Yeah, this is just... Yeah, this is not... I can't pick this.
[79:19.29]This is like a glitch from the lightning.
[79:25.03]Yeah, what are you guys talking about?
[79:32.76]Watch Frasier on stream.
[79:38.17]I didn't... I never got into Frasier.
[79:40.49]I didn't get it.
[79:40.95]I just couldn't... I was just like... I couldn't follow anything going on.
[79:50.12]I think I was just too young.
[79:51.28]I was too young to care about Frasier.
[79:57.33]The only thing that's in my brain from Frasier is, I don't know why, but like him doing like Kramer-esque entrances into rooms and like erratic movements and stuff.
[80:09.62]It's like all I can see in my head.
[80:11.47]I don't know why that's in my brain.
[80:13.77]He's like opening a door going like, what happened here?
[80:18.89]I don't know why I'm making him and Kramer the same person.
[80:25.17]Like, in my brain right now, I'm watching him open the door to Jerry's apartment.
[80:28.91]And, like, be Kramer.
[80:30.73]I don't know why.
[80:37.63]Can I eat those?
[80:44.56]This is a silver key chest.
[80:45.58]The number of keys needed to open it is shown on the chest.
[80:47.36]Ooh, I can open it.
[80:48.12]I only needed one.
[80:51.61]Dog tricks.
[80:52.23]The bunny hop.
[80:54.43]Dog trainer and circus owner, Rufina Musket.

[81:16.70]Watch this.
[81:25.79]Dog can now bunny hop.
[81:26.99]To see him do this, dance, laugh, whistle, play the lute, or strike a heroic pose.
[81:32.71]Okay.
[81:42.30]Are you going to dance?
[81:47.93]That's it?
[81:52.77]Alright, hold on.
[81:53.09]Let's look for more treasure chests.
[81:59.19]What's in here?

[82:09.51]Nice.
[82:09.75]Alright, I can marry somebody now.
[82:23.24]He's trying his best.
[82:24.18]Yeah, he's doing fine.
[82:28.04]He's doing great.
[82:33.20]I was going to shock that guy.
[82:34.34]We're going to get rid of... Tell me when Jerm is streaming.
[82:35.94]Right now.
[82:55.92]Okay.
[82:56.02]He's giving money?
[82:56.98]Alright, let's go get him.
[82:58.04]Yo, when's this guy streaming?
[83:27.15]Put it out!
[83:29.43]How mad is he?
[83:29.97]I just got here.
[83:31.39]I'm not mad at all.
[83:32.09]I'm perfectly fine.
[83:39.66]I'm not angry.

[83:44.74]Having a lot of nostalgia fun.
[83:46.14]By the way, don't miss next Sunday's stream.
[83:49.67]Just want to make sure everyone's aware of that.
[84:02.45]Sunday's stream is going to be interesting.
[84:05.03]I have an obligation.
[84:07.07]Somebody has been blowing my phone up for a long time.
[84:11.07]Finally going to give this person the opportunity they wanted a long time ago.
[84:15.05]They're very excited.
[84:16.57]Of course they are.
[84:17.27]I'm not going to be on the stream.
[84:21.11]I'm just going to let them do whatever they want.
[84:24.97]And hopefully it's good.
[84:26.89]I don't know.
[84:27.89]Look out!
[84:28.53]It's an ambush!
[84:32.75]Bandits.
[84:36.59]Oh, that was easy.
[84:37.41]Anybody else?
[84:53.96]What do you mean I've been hurt by an enemy?
[85:02.57]Oh my god, magic is awesome!
[85:10.47]You can now afford Force Push.
[85:14.89]It's just Jedi Academy again.
[85:22.56]Yeah, it is Jedi Academy again, isn't it?
[85:28.06]Oh shit, that was cool!
[85:41.24]You gotta keep, like, a combo going, right?
[85:42.60]They're just waiting for you to kill them.
[85:50.52]Whoa!
[86:07.00]Oh shit.
[86:07.64]One, two, three.
[86:10.22]Watch out!
[86:11.22]Wait, did I kill him?

[87:22.80]Alright.
[87:23.36]Good boy.
[87:30.28]You alright?
[87:32.54]Yes, you're okay.
[87:37.19]While Thag keeps it in his chest, don't worry.
[87:38.77]Stand back.
[87:39.25]That's not hurting him, is it?
[87:52.67]What do you got in here?
[87:55.05]Cage key, rancid beef jerky, and a money bag.
[87:59.34]Nice.
[87:59.82]Alright, anything else?

[88:03.24]I don't know, whatever.
[88:13.07]Oi, mate!
[88:14.97]Don't even think about letting them out.
[88:18.41]Those slaves belong to me.
[88:21.02]I paid for them.
[88:22.46]Are you?
[88:23.12]Okay.
[88:23.68]Look, I don't want any trouble.
[88:26.70]Give the key to me and I'll make it worth your while.
[88:30.84]No, don't listen to him.
[88:32.48]Kevin.
[88:33.36]Shut up.
[88:36.48]You wouldn't do that to us, would you, Sparrow?
[88:40.21]I said shut it.
[88:41.75]I'm not going to tell you again.
[88:43.07]Ah.
[88:49.13]Am I this bad?
[88:49.67]I can't hit him.
[88:51.23]You're right.
[88:52.13]I could, couldn't I?
[89:15.11]Are you going to say sorry?
[89:15.79]Are you going to say sorry or should I give you more juice?
[89:19.97]Say sorry.
[89:21.17]Come on, guys.
[89:21.97]Let's go.
[89:22.41]Thank you so much.
[89:23.20]We're free.
[89:40.58]Free to wander the paths and byways of the land.
[89:43.46]No, master, but the wind itself.
[89:45.80]Time stretched out before us like... Like... What's the word I want, Reg?
[89:53.45]I don't know.
[89:54.21]Turn safety on.
[89:56.01]Turn safety on.

[90:08.94]Alright, I'm turning safety on.
[90:14.97]Alright, let me, hold on, let me look at what else we got.
[90:16.52]They might have some fucking goodies.
[90:23.48]It'll be funnier if it's off.
[90:27.78]Not yet.
[90:28.46]Let me at least get to, like, level two magician, and then maybe.
[90:30.82]Alright, let's go back.
[90:36.48]I can level up.

[90:57.41]House, house, house, house, house.
[90:59.19]I'm looking at the house.
[91:03.93]What's that?
[91:07.23]Buy and move in.

[93:11.12]It's like a pre-rendered video of something, but they have the settings all wrong.

[108:02.10]The 24 FPS thing depends on light exposure.
[108:04.74]Computer monitors a bunch of lights.
[108:08.24]Yeah, I mean, alright.
[108:09.56]If it's not 60 FPS, then just get it out of me.
[108:14.09]Get it away from me.
[108:24.11]It's a bunch of atoms.
[108:33.40]Play VR at 24 FPS.
[108:36.94]Cool.
[108:37.30]Yeah, that would suck.
[108:40.79]That would be really awful.
[108:43.39]I got promoted.
[108:43.95]Alright.
[108:45.37]Take the next job.
[108:46.75]Let's keep the multiplier going.
[108:52.63]Level 3 Blacksmith.
[108:53.87]Let's go.
[108:54.23]$7,000?
[108:55.15]Am I about to just make like $10,000?
[108:58.05]I'm going to buy a bunch of houses and stuff.
[109:08.48]He's addicted?
[109:09.64]Yeah, I'm addicted to money.
[109:21.56]I have 1,500.
[109:21.82]I want to have, like, 10 grand.
[109:24.25]And I'm going to go buy, like, a really cool wand.
[109:40.80]How many?
[109:41.12]There's five levels?
[109:45.04]This is going to take, like, 30 minutes.
[109:46.32]No, there's no wand.
[109:50.70]I'm just going to do up to level, um... I'm just going to get to the next level and that's it.
[109:55.02]And then I'm going to go meet Teresa after I buy some new clothes.
[109:58.62]I'm going to go buy a bunch of food.
[109:59.48]I want to get fat too.
[110:00.22]Like, of course I'm going to do that.
[110:01.22]If you're going to give me the opportunity to do that, I'm not going to be like the fat guy in the game.
[110:04.62]Are you serious?
[110:05.86]Why would I not do that?
[110:10.51]I'm going to be like a big fat magician.
[110:23.71]Oh, by the way, I got weighed recently at the doctor.
[110:27.55]I'm 161 pounds.
[110:28.87]I'm gaining, and I'm gaining.
[110:32.77]I've got to cut it down.
[110:33.69]I've got to change the diet a little bit, I think.
[110:39.36]We don't care.
[110:40.02]I do, so I'm going to tell you about it.
[110:47.16]Ooh, I almost blew it.
[110:51.52]Why are you telling us this?
[110:53.79]I don't know.
[110:54.23]Hey, yeah, you screwed me up.
[110:56.37]What do you mean?
[110:57.39]Why wouldn't I tell you this?
[111:00.11]What is this like stream?
[111:02.51]I'm gonna tell you stuff that happens in my life.
[111:15.20]You choked.
[111:16.12]Yeah, because I'm talking about how fat I am and somebody said I don't even care and I'm like, well, I care how fat I'm getting.
[111:25.77]Oh, I'm all screwed up now.
[111:28.87]I'll get it.
[111:29.17]I just checked your BMI.
[111:39.19]Yeah, my BMI is probably like 70 or something.
[111:42.39]You know how to use a hammer?
[111:55.79]70.
[111:56.17]Yeah, 70 would be I'd be made out of, like, butter.
[112:03.03]I'm not even sure that butter has a 70% BMI.
[112:19.52]BMI is body mass index.
[112:22.09]You're doing a good job.
[112:27.38]Yeah, yeah.
[112:28.32]It's a nice fancy fucking thing that guys with a big fancy degrees tell you to stop eating Doritos every day.
[112:32.82]Okay.
[112:33.74]Sure.
[112:34.00]Oh!
[112:36.38]Look, that was fucked up.
[112:50.65]That was fucked up.
[112:51.19]Did you see that?
[112:53.80]The FPS, it like skipped.
[113:09.90]Here, if you're 10 pounds overweight, you win.
[113:13.64]I believe I'm like 5 pounds overweight.
[113:16.82]Which, I can fix that.
[113:17.62]That's easy.
[113:17.94]I'll just... I'll be fine.
[113:31.39]Running for my prostate exam?
[113:34.20]Wait, what?
[113:35.80]Just go in.
[113:49.67]Alright, my multiplier is getting pretty good.
[113:51.97]This will be fine.
[113:52.58]Don't screw it up.
[113:58.16]144, let's go.
[113:59.46]Five grand.
[114:10.47]God damn it.
[114:11.21]Oh wow, that was a complete fake.
[114:12.75]That was a total, I should not have gotten that.
[114:14.75]It was not even in the green, not even close.
[114:20.74]I need to do 30 more?
[114:32.09]No, I don't.
[114:33.89]What do you mean 30?
[114:35.73]Fuck.
[114:36.27]Alright.
[114:36.63]That guy fucked with me.
[114:37.83]Whatever.
[114:38.27]I'm done.
[114:38.53]Alright.
[114:47.88]This Teresa.
[114:48.78]Alright, Teresa.
[114:49.42]I'm here.
[114:52.19]I apologize for the delay.
[114:54.29]Events are moving quickly indeed.
[114:58.73]Think about your life.
[115:00.80]All the places you've been.
[115:02.16]The people you've known.
[115:03.08]Okay, up and down.
[115:03.92]Everything you've done.
[115:04.56]Make comments.
[115:06.26]How many moments.
[115:07.42]How many memories.
[115:09.74]Thag and his men.
[115:11.46]They had just as many.
[115:13.81]And now they have none.
[115:15.39]Because of you.
[115:17.39]Do you feel the weight of responsibility yet?
[115:19.69]No.
[115:20.77]You will get used to the burden, as all heroes must.
[115:25.49]Come.
[115:27.01]The world is better off without Thag, and certainly Bower Lake is in your debt.
[115:32.30]But to really see the impact of your actions, you need look no further than Bower's town.
[115:36.74]Consequences?
[115:37.38]Uh-oh.
[115:38.20]It has changed much since you lived here, particularly Old Town, where you spent your childhood.
[115:43.08]I almost just pressed triangle and shot that lady with a crossbow.
[115:45.85]The simplest choice can have far-reaching consequences.
[115:56.07]That's gonna happen eventually, I know it is.
[115:59.09]Oh, it's my old... hand!
[116:01.61]Whatever this is.
[116:02.15]That is where Lucian is now.
[116:04.35]The Tattered Spire.
[116:05.91]Where?
[116:10.27]I thought he was in the moon.
[116:12.77]The Spire was intended as a conduit for all the magic in the world, granting the kingdom's ruler a power so great he could bend reality to his will.
[116:23.23]On the day it was completed, and the first wish made, a light bloomed inside, though its nature could not have been darker.
[116:35.41]Albion shattered.
[116:39.96]Centuries of civilization were wiped out in moments.
[116:43.06]Its people erased from existence.
[116:45.10]Some say that this was the first wish, an end to a hollow and corrupt world, and for a purer one to take its place.
[116:57.78]And now the spire rises once again.
[117:02.64]Lucien found documents which foretold the coming of one who would stop him using the spire.
[117:08.21]Me?
[117:10.05]That is why your sister died.
[117:11.67]Oh.
[117:12.63]And that is why you will face him.
[117:15.21]The cards have shown me this.
[117:18.07]Here.
[117:20.19]Take a look.
[117:23.05]Eight cards.
[117:24.61]Each of the three heroes you see in the cards is a step on the hidden path to Lucian's downfall.
[117:31.50]And the life force of heroes, will itself, is the key to the spell.
[117:35.82]Why is he running?
[117:36.56]Wait, what?
[117:37.74]Lucian's agents scour the land even as we speak.
[117:41.96]You must find the three heroes before Lucian does because you are the fourth, the one who will bring his downfall.
[117:49.92]I have seen a vision of a holy ritual in Oakfield.
[117:54.10]Salvation, though bittersweet, is delivered by one of incredible strength.
[118:01.69]Speak to the abbot at the Temple of Light and see what you can learn of this pilgrim.
[118:07.47]The road to Oakfield will be dangerous.
[118:09.29]You saw the poop in your pants?
[118:10.80]How would you have seen the poop in my pants?
[118:16.88]Alright, I have money.
[118:17.60]I want to buy some stuff.
[118:18.56]What's that?
[118:27.27]Oh shit, look at this.
[118:28.13]Buy Richard the Stonecutter.
[118:31.80]Final price, $5,500.
[118:32.68]Should I buy this?
[118:43.74]Kill the owner.
[118:46.02]Where is he?
[118:46.95]Kill the owner?
[119:09.97]Eliminate that guy.
[119:12.41]Alright, so if I tell somebody to follow me, and then I walk them into a bunch of bandits and they just get killed.
[119:18.30]I am not- I don't kill them so I don't get bad person points, but I can just take the money that's on them and then buy their empty house.
[119:23.86]Is that accurate?
[119:25.51]Pretty evil.
[119:44.90]Sounds like a serial killer.
[119:49.16]You're better off just being pure evil.
[119:51.81]No, but then I don't get the benefits of being good.
[119:56.13]Which, by the way, what are the benefits of being good?
[119:58.91]I've never done it in any one of these video games.
[120:02.27]I always accidentally just start murdering people in the towns, and I've never seen what a good playthrough is.
[120:11.94]Ever.
[120:18.30]You look less ugly.
[120:19.49]Is that it?
[120:25.11]Just less ugly?
[120:26.07]People will constantly want to marry you.
[120:33.02]I guess that is a little annoying.
[120:37.44]A good blow.
[120:40.90]There you go.
[120:41.20]I got a good multiplier here.
[120:50.34]New sword.
[120:50.86]What do you think?
[120:51.32]250.
[120:51.90]Let's go.
[120:52.20]Thanks.
[121:09.39]Ooh, that was risky.
[121:12.77]Evil is funner.
[121:17.56]I missed, but it's okay.
[121:21.52]I mean, evil is always going to be funner because I can just walk into a store and just take everything.
[121:27.05]I don't even need money.
[121:28.33]I can just kill the guy behind the register and take everything in the fucking store.
[121:32.11]Of course it's funner and easier.
[121:42.92]There's good, evil, and then pure and corrupt.
[121:45.76]Hmm.
[121:48.00]Should I be good and corrupt?
[121:50.60]Or evil and pure?
[121:51.76]What does that even mean?
[121:52.90]Evil and pure?
[122:04.76]Pure evil.
[122:06.58]Oh, I see.
[122:07.04]Oh, that was a mistake.
[122:14.39]It means evil and vegetarian.
[122:18.45]I fucked it up.
[122:19.07]Yeah, I got too greedy.
[122:20.27]Sorry.
[122:23.37]Should I just be an evil vegan?
[122:25.07]No, I won't be able to get fat.
[122:29.82]Should I be a fat vegan?
[122:38.58]How is that?
[122:53.01]I don't know why that's like making me laugh.
[122:56.79]I don't know why because like you could be fat anything It's just based on like calories and like fat content Yeah, I'm gonna be a good fat
[123:20.49]Pure evil vegetarian.
[123:23.18]Alright, almost there.
[123:43.39]Good fatty acids only.
[123:46.75]That's how you make a blade.
[123:49.76]Damn it.
[123:50.18]I was reading chat.
[123:51.30]Shit.
[123:51.76]I was so... I'm almost done.
[123:55.56]I'm almost done.
[123:57.18]Please.
[124:05.71]Yeah.
[124:06.85]I'm going to be chaotic, monounsaturated fat.
[124:13.57]Holy shit.
[124:14.19]That was awful.
[124:14.91]What was I doing?
[124:21.59]Alright, almost done.
[124:32.18]I promise I'm not going to do this.
[124:33.44]I need money though.
[124:40.76]Jerma, this is too much.
[124:43.94]I'm just playing a blacksmithing minigame.
[124:47.67]I'm not electrocuting your seat.
[124:52.07]Oh shit, I didn't even test if the audio was synced.
[124:54.33]I'm almost done.
[125:02.42]Everybody relax.
[125:04.04]You're doing a good job.
[125:15.10]I'm doing this now because I wanted to do this later.
[125:17.63]It's shaping up nicely.
[125:19.28]You know, you realize if I do this now, then it's a super simple way for me to make a bunch of money later.
[125:38.09]Every time you hit the hammer wrong, I receive one-fifth of a lethal injection.
[125:45.22]I'm really hate to tell you but one-fifth of a lethal injection is a lethal injection.
[125:50.54]You're gone There's no such thing as that.
[125:53.06]I'm sorry That dude's dead no, he's not I haven't missed I
[126:17.27]Alright.
[126:18.99]Here we go.
[126:19.51]We're good.
[126:20.70]Now we're going to go until I lose.
[126:23.92]What's going on?
[126:38.69]Just go until you lose.
[126:40.23]Because this is a ton of money.
[126:46.24]Next level?
[126:46.70]Not yet, not yet.
[126:48.96]Alright, now we're done.
[126:49.54]We're done.
[126:50.38]I got 9,500 bucks.
[126:50.90]Time to get some more equipment.
[126:51.72]I want a better outfit.
[126:53.91]And I'm gonna eat a shitload of food.
[127:05.41]Alright, food.
[127:06.05]What do I got?
[127:08.37]I got a bunch of stuff.
[127:09.13]Yeah, let's eat.
[127:10.73]Alright, let's have some fucking mutton.
[127:15.49]Ugly?
[127:18.04]Okay, what if they don't see me gain weight?
[127:19.80]What if I just show up later and I'm fat?
[127:22.44]They won't see me turning fat.
[127:32.67]Alright.
[127:33.51]Tomato juice.
[127:35.35]Chicken fried mutton.
[127:41.70]No, I can't give you any of this.
[127:46.27]Wait, that kid just said school gives me too much homework.
[127:48.24]Dude, you do have school.
[127:55.88]Does getting fat make you slower?
[127:57.46]Okay, now we go drink a bunch of beer.
[128:07.32]Is there a way I can see how fat I am?
[128:27.91]Look in a mirror?
[128:28.95]No.
[128:29.85]I'm talking about, like... Holy shit, what's going on?
[128:37.68]I just got... I...
[128:43.21]I want more like bread.
[128:44.27]Here we go.

[133:06.39]I don't.
[133:06.99]I can't.
[133:07.53]There's too many people to embarrass myself in front of.
[133:09.23]If you're just joining, I'm playing Fable 2.
[133:18.32]I'm in the middle of trying to make my guy very large and strong and heavy.

[134:30.18]Can I get a wizard hat?
[134:32.70]Yes, I need the wizard hat.
[134:33.52]Of course I do.
[134:34.04]Okay.
[134:48.91]I want headgear.
[134:50.53]Can I not wear the mask and the... Yeah, I can wear... Can I wear them both?
[134:53.79]Really?
[134:58.48]Really?
[135:06.11]Okay, I like those.
[135:07.05]Mask, here we go.
[135:16.21]Oh.
[135:16.39]I have to wear something up here.
[135:17.68]How about the big gown?
[135:22.28]Wow, I'm attractive.
[135:24.20]What?
[135:25.00]Afraid of me?
[135:27.58]Anything I can get you?
[135:35.42]Yeah, the Archmage robes.
[135:36.88]That's perfect.
[135:38.93]Okay.
[135:39.69]Okay, perfect.
[135:45.67]What do you think of me now?
[135:47.71]Thank you.
[135:52.13]Robe and wizard hat.
[135:54.85]Not yet.
[135:55.37]I like how this looks.
[136:00.03]You're about to steal from a villager.
[136:01.11]This is a crime.
[136:01.73]The eye icon tells you if anyone can see you.
[136:04.73]Aww.
[136:05.23]You're such a sweet one, Dumpling.
[136:09.11]My grandma was a farmer.
[136:10.73]She had a big bushy beard.
[136:15.20]How may I help you today?
[136:16.46]You're such a nice dog, aren't you?
[136:21.22]The perfect rhyme.
[136:21.98]The dog distracts them.
[136:24.36]It was four gold?
[136:28.86]28 grand.
[136:29.28]Alright.
[136:29.54]I'm going to do a mission.
[136:37.20]Bad boy time?
[136:38.00]Yeah, we're big good picture, bad small picture.
[136:41.32]That means I can steal from registers.
[136:42.68]That means I can punch people in the face if I don't like them at all.
[136:48.78]But I'm going to be a good person in the grand scheme of things.
[136:54.52]Stealing $40 from the register, but I'm going to save the town.
[136:59.30]See?
[136:59.64]I'm gonna shock somebody accidentally.
[137:01.74]Does the game save itself?
[137:24.29]But crime is way down.
[137:26.62]And urban renewal is... Chaotic Hungary.
[137:28.94]...the most desirable district in Bowerstone.
[137:33.13]Fantastic, isn't it?
[137:35.87]As a good friend of the sheriff, you'll find the shopkeepers here will give you a discount on all goods and services.
[137:42.09]Oh, shit.
[137:42.67]Thank you.
[137:43.87]Of course.
[137:44.71]The same discount extends to that sister of yours, should she be in town.
[137:49.83]Well, I won't take any more of your time.
[137:51.97]Thank you.
[137:52.41]Have a good day.
[137:54.59]I will.
[137:55.91]I appreciate that.
[137:56.59]Thanks for the discount.
[137:57.59]Dig spot.
[138:04.41]Where's our dig spot?
[138:05.21]Over here?
[138:07.48]Where is it?
[138:10.66]Where is it?
[138:14.64]Where's the dig spot?
[138:20.35]Is this illegal?
[138:28.05]Um.
[138:28.11]What the hell is going on?
[138:29.39]Is it because of safety?
[138:40.22]Oh, by the way, I want to make it clear again.
[138:46.42]Don't miss the stream next weekend on Sunday.
[138:49.51]Recipro peanuts?
[138:50.27]Okay.
[138:52.71]Alright, what do you want?
[138:53.37]Oh, they know that I'm the swordsman.
[138:55.51]Okay.
[139:08.75]Am I streaming Saturday too?
[139:09.97]I am not.
[139:13.87]I am streaming tomorrow, but next Saturday, no.
[139:16.65]Next Sunday only.
[139:17.33]Alright, let's go find this guy.
[139:27.24]I need to level up.
[139:28.24]How do I level up?
[139:28.90]Do I have to go to the guild thing?
[139:31.33]Hmm.
[139:41.03]Surprising.
[139:41.53]You gained 200 pounds.
[139:43.03]Just drink it right now.
[139:47.66]Nice job.
[139:49.20]You found me ground wine.
[139:53.04]Can I open this?
[139:53.40]Is it five?
[139:56.64]Oh, damn it.
[140:11.04]Wait, you're streaming next Sunday?
[140:12.64]Well... This channel's gonna be live, but... It's not... It's not gonna be me streaming.
[140:19.84]I have to... It's a whole ordeal.
[140:24.24]Alright, what do I want here?
[140:28.17]Chaos?
[140:28.55]Or just Shock 2?
[140:30.77]Okay.
[140:40.06]I think I want chaos.
[140:41.82]Chaos confuses your foes, making them unpredictable.
[140:46.03]You've learned the chaos spell.
[140:47.07]Summon a mask of madness to scramble the minds of your enemies and you never know what might happen.
[140:51.35]Cast your spell wide to catch more enemies.
[140:53.33]Okay.
[140:54.09]How do I select which one I want to use?
[140:55.39]I can do time as well?
[141:01.74]Time control allows you to slow the world around you or to move with incredible speed.
[141:06.56]Oh, I can buy this too.
[141:07.54]No, I'll save it.
[141:08.22]I don't need it.
[141:12.07]Extra style accuracy speed.
[141:13.75]Oh, I can learn roll.
[141:19.67]I want this.
[141:21.83]Tap A while moving.
[141:22.69]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[141:23.27]That's a huge deal.
[141:24.68]I need it.
[141:28.94]And physique.
[141:32.80]Toughness.
[141:33.56]There we go.
[141:34.04]More health.
[141:41.40]When there is a sail on, the thing will flash.
[141:44.68]Press it now.
[141:45.26]What?
[141:48.36]Sails.
[141:50.28]Blacksmith's sail?
[141:51.32]Oh shit.
[141:53.80]Oh my god.
[141:57.52]Alright.
[142:00.73]Okay.
[142:02.25]Let's go.
[142:03.79]How do I select a spell?
[142:05.47]Is there a way I can select a spell?
[142:12.42]Left bumper?
[142:19.32]B?
[142:21.25]Watch out, dog.
[142:23.65]Hold B. Push down on the D-pad with a weapon drawn while facing a potential victim to turn off safety mode.
[142:45.43]Oh, hello.
[142:47.43]Now, this isn't what it looks like.
[142:53.20]Okay, so this is a bad guy.
[142:57.44]I didn't kill these people.
[142:58.98]The bandits did.
[143:00.56]They took the loot, but they didn't check the bodies.
[143:03.28]Oh, alright.
[143:06.78]This is bad.
[143:11.79]What'd you get there?
[143:13.34]Ooh, that's nice, that is.
[143:16.64]I'm sure they'd want you to have it.
[143:19.24]Is that evil?
[143:28.15]That guy was a bad guy.
[143:34.29]That was a bad guy.
[143:38.93]He probably ran him off the road.
[143:40.33]That was a lie.
[143:43.49]Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[143:45.64]St.
[143:45.84]Peter can fucking judge that guy, okay?
[143:47.26]So you can go up and St.
[143:48.16]Peter can judge him, not me.
[143:51.00]Ow!
[143:51.08]Crossbow?
[143:51.56]Who needs a fucking crossbow when I got... UNLIMITED POWER!
[144:18.93]Oh shit, give me that stuff.
[144:19.83]Damn it.
[144:27.11]Give me it.
[144:42.24]Alright, let's do chaos.
[144:49.08]Hey!
[144:50.08]Who is it?
[144:54.24]Whatever.
[144:54.62]They can't even hit me.
[144:56.99]One spell, Andy.
[144:58.09]It's effective.
[144:58.99]It's a really good spell.
[145:04.45]Oh, I like that one.
[145:06.65]That one, I feel like I should be like... What does he say?
[145:24.07]Avada Kedavra, okay.
[145:34.03]Let's fight each other, who cares?
[145:44.12]Is he even doing anything?
[145:48.26]This spell sucks.
[145:55.44]What am I even doing here?
[145:59.86]Why would I do that when I could just do this?
[146:11.90]Everybody fight.
[146:12.34]What just happened?
[146:14.16]What?
[146:14.62]Fuck.
[146:18.47]Doctor Strange?
[146:28.34]Alright, fight each other!
[146:29.22]What are they all standing around for?
[146:41.23]Who- Am I even fighting bad people here right now?
[146:43.87]No, no, no.
[146:55.89]I don't want to fall.
[146:56.55]I want his stuff.
[146:59.34]That's what I want.
[147:09.29]I want to confuse them then shoot them in the head.
[147:18.30]Alright, that Billy's terrible.
[147:30.08]I gotta go to bed.
[147:30.74]Well, have a great sleep, man.
[147:33.02]Thanks for watching.
[147:34.58]Hopefully we see you maybe tomorrow.
[147:35.78]Maybe we'll see you tomorrow.
[147:38.26]If not, then I really hope we see you on next Sunday.
[147:44.74]Ooh, the dog's book of war.
[147:52.15]Your dog is now a two-star fighter.
[147:58.77]Oh, nice.
[147:59.23]Okay.
[148:07.97]Remember your crossbow.
[148:09.32]This can be over before they know it.
[148:10.83]Okay.
[148:44.59]He reacted to it.
[148:45.53]I'm trying to go like right in his face.
[149:01.11]How come he's not getting up?
[149:11.96]What is going on?
[149:17.64]He stood up
[149:36.00]Alright, that was the last straw.
[149:37.23]We were gonna ignore this guy.
[149:38.99]He shitted my face.
[149:40.89]He shit his pants in my face.
[149:42.19]Like, that was it.
[149:42.93]Like, I'm not gonna fucking stand for that.
[149:44.23]Oh my god, they're kicking the shit out of me.
[150:01.14]Oh, eat this.
[150:08.34]Okay.
[150:08.80]Oh, what do you got?
[150:11.68]Dig spot?
[150:12.22]Let's go.
[150:15.39]And a treasure right here.
[150:16.23]This game is fun.
[150:19.23]This game's really not that hard, but whatever we do is fun.
[150:22.25]Oh, money.
[150:29.58]That was a real fart, like, fecal funny moment.
[150:35.02]Well...
[150:38.19]It's guaranteed comedy.
[150:43.22]Hide snout.
[150:44.76]Your dog can now hide his snout to see him do it belch or fart.
[150:48.86]Well, I have to do it.
[150:49.50]That's so stupid.
[151:03.79]Sus guy shits his pants.
[151:12.09]Look!
[151:13.05]Another traveler!
[151:15.68]Wanna get to Oakfield?
[151:17.60]You'll have to swim, lovey!
[151:22.08]Yeah, jump!
[151:24.44]Jump, jump, jump!
[151:27.82]Dive!
[151:30.02]What?
[151:30.26]Sorry!
[151:32.04]You always have to peek!
[151:33.60]Aww.
[151:38.70]For once, the bandits are correct.
[151:43.81]Can't shoot these people?
[151:45.05]Why?
[151:49.41]It's scripted.
[152:01.62]Yes, it is.
[152:06.24]Ooh, bandit cave.
[152:07.30]Let's go.
[152:15.51]I don't know why I just thought this was Diablo 3.
[152:19.97]I thought this guy was going to be following me around in the cave and eventually show up in the camp with something.
[152:25.50]Be like a merchant.
[152:26.16]I don't know why I thought that's exactly what was going to happen.
[152:28.72]Alright, what do you need?
[152:29.24]What's going on?
[152:29.58]Okay.
[152:30.62]I hear cats meowing.
[152:48.40]I know I played this game, but for some reason I have zero memories of it.
[152:58.66]Yeah, me too.
[153:01.30]I think I went to the midnight release of this game.
[153:04.18]I remember getting this super early. ...
[153:20.05]Strength potion, alright.
[153:20.98]Super forgettable?
[153:22.40]Oh.
[153:22.52]I mean... Yeah, I... It was very... Yeah, I don't remember any of this.
[153:25.56]I remember the... Oh, it's the sound of your own heartbeat.
[153:28.00]That's it.
[153:28.26]There's a sail going on.
[153:30.10]Oh, whatever.
[153:55.46]I need some better items, though.
[153:56.38]I can't just shock people all stream.
[154:00.22]Oh, come here.
[154:00.60]It's okay.
[154:00.83]Come here.
[154:03.15]What the fuck was that?
[154:05.91]What the hell happened?
[154:09.15]Is this guy possessed?
[154:16.26]This guy's gonna die.
[154:19.38]What?
[154:28.87]Uh-oh.
[154:29.53]Alright, stay behind me.
[154:34.87]Are they gonna die?
[154:54.89]If I'm this guy, I'm going holy shit.
[154:55.95]This guy's really weak.
[155:09.54]That was fucking awful.
[155:12.48]Oh, they're disgusting.
[155:14.91]But they couldn't be... I mean, they couldn't actually have been children, could they?
[155:21.77]Oh, Joey...
[155:24.29]Oh, yes.
[155:24.71]Very good.
[155:26.97]Oh, you're back.
[155:28.13]Oh, I'm so glad.
[155:30.51]Oh, Joey.
[155:33.19]I'm the silent protagonist.
[155:34.64]You must think I'm pathetic.
[155:37.76]Get up here.
[155:38.16]Let's go.
[155:42.42]Let's keep moving.
[155:43.24]Come on.
[155:43.50]I'm trying to save you.
[155:46.40]Do you think this is safe?
[155:48.95]These walkways.
[155:51.11]Don't worry.
[155:52.67]I put every single point in one move.
[155:56.21]I barely know how to walk.
[156:00.42]I don't know how to read.
[156:01.24]I have no idea what a fucking pen does.
[156:05.10]Let me tell you, when I was a little kid, all the way through my early adulthood into my 30s, I put every fucking birthday worth of points into lightning bolt.
[156:13.09]We're gonna be fine.
[156:13.95]You're just gonna have to guide me around.
[156:15.09]Where's this dig spot?
[156:21.55]Where is it?
[156:22.15]What are you talking about?
[156:32.55]And I hit him in the chest.
[156:33.29]I'm like, hey, hey.
[156:34.43]Don't bring me near water, though.
[156:35.71]Don't bring me near water, though.
[156:40.77]I love myself a useless.
[156:41.43]I can hear him.
[156:44.08]I'm coming.
[156:44.36]I'm coming.
[156:54.48]What's that one doing?
[156:55.56]What's wrong with that guy?
[156:57.60]Why is he shimmying around his stomach?
[157:12.21]One move, Andy.
[157:12.97]That's right.
[157:13.43]That's me.
[157:22.35]This is how you gain magic points, though.
[157:31.31]Dude, I mean, on all your birthday skill points, you didn't put any into, like, even walking or running?
[157:38.53]Nope.
[157:43.70]Or thinking or, like, strength?
[157:46.40]Nope, none.
[157:49.43]I've actually, I've had to be, I've had to be fed at a baby seat my entire life.
[157:54.34]I don't even know what, I don't even, I couldn't even tell you what food is.
[157:57.20]I'm just saying, somebody just gives it to me.
[157:59.52]Okay.
[158:00.92]Well, I could power the entire city of Las Vegas if you let me.
[158:20.70]Hey, let's go.
[158:26.92]Holy shit, dog.
[158:28.34]What the fuck was that?
[158:44.65]Alright, I'll handle this one.
[158:49.80]What the hell is that?
[158:52.32]What the hell was that?
[158:54.73]Oh shit, is he alive?
[158:55.91]Where is he?
[158:57.47]Oh, whoops.
[159:01.93]It was too late.
[159:05.98]I turned my son into... And I always told him those stories were made up.
[159:11.78]They were true.
[159:20.95]Is he dead?
[159:22.21]Oh shit!
[159:54.75]Oh my god, what the fuck just happened?
[159:59.11]Ow!
[159:59.25]Hey!
[160:03.19]They got sick of my shit.
[160:08.65]Shit, okay.
[160:10.21]They can't do that to me, right?
[160:12.95]What am I doing?
[160:14.55]Turn around!
[160:15.15]What the fuck am I doing?
[160:18.97]Turn around!
[160:20.49]Turn around!
[160:21.37]Oh my fucking god, why am I stuck here?
[160:27.13]Thank you.
[160:28.55]Alright.
[160:38.26]Here we go.
[160:43.08]Good.
[160:46.80]Is he dead?
[160:51.25]Nice.
[160:52.87]Alright.
[160:53.09]I got a lot of points.
[160:56.26]Force Lightning Andy.
[160:57.46]I don't... I'm gonna get new abilities.
[160:59.44]Don't worry.
[160:59.84]I need to get Vortex.
[161:17.73]That's what I want now.
[161:35.26]Shock, shock, shock.
[161:37.91]I do need to do melee though.
[161:39.11]I can't just not do melee.
[161:40.89]How am I ever gonna have health?
[161:49.86]He's so bad.
[161:51.46]Why am I bad?
[162:06.02]Alright.
[162:06.60]Give these guys migraines so they fight each other.
[162:08.30]Fight each other.
[162:19.87]Do something.
[162:22.95]All these level 1 spells are awful.
[162:38.06]There's no mana.
[162:38.56]No, there's no mana in the game.
[162:39.60]That's right.
[162:43.04]Oh, there's a wooden ass sword too.
[162:49.10]Yeah, I'm going full vortex.
[162:52.33]Fuck it.
[162:53.37]I'm going to make vortex my number one move.
[163:07.61]Alright, let's go.
[163:10.96]There are no health bars other than your own.
[163:12.44]That's true too.
[163:17.48]Watch out, don't die.
[163:18.30]I can't die in Fable 2.
[163:19.73]Not in like the first two levels.
[163:21.43]That'd be embarrassing.
[163:25.19]I'm stuck again.
[163:26.83]Why am I stuck doing this again?
[163:39.70]Fuck.
[163:44.72]This is fun.
[163:45.32]This is a fun game.
[163:47.32]Alright.
[163:59.59]Let's go.
[164:00.17]I'm not experienced, but whatever.
[164:01.37]What the fuck is this?
[164:03.01]This is Fable 2, man.
[164:07.75]Fable 2.
[164:09.07]Wait, give me that.
[164:09.85]Did I admit?
[164:10.79]I admitted something.
[164:11.71]What did I admit?
[164:12.57]Five vortex.
[164:12.99]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[164:14.11]Let's do that.
[164:34.11]Alright.
[164:35.07]Will.
[164:36.55]Shock 2.
[164:39.03]I could do Shock 2 though.
[164:43.94]Vortex.
[164:45.66]Yeah.
[164:46.10]I want Vortex.
[164:48.62]Powerful Whirlwinds.
[164:54.82]I can get level 2.
[164:56.14]Done.
[164:56.32]Alright.
[164:58.72]I have level 2 Vortex.
[165:04.60]Chaos confuses your foes, making them unpredictable.
[165:07.98]Alright, let's do it.
[165:11.42]You have several level 1 spells.
[165:15.41]Oh shit, this is level 1?
[165:16.67]This is level 2.
[165:19.13]What does it do?
[165:21.05]Oh, fuck.
[165:26.43]Now it's level 2.
[165:27.33]Oh my god.
[165:30.75]Alright, this is going to be kind of insane.
[165:40.81]I can't just cast lightning bolt exclusively.
[165:42.91]No, apparently not.
[165:49.93]Do lightning and vortex?
[165:51.06]That sounds pretty good.
[165:53.42]Grab them in the vortex and when they're spinning around, lightning the fuck out of them.
[165:57.60]Yeah, I'll be storm.
[166:06.18]Storm mage?
[166:14.02]Do I have any food?
[166:14.68]What about potions?
[166:21.08]Oh, here we go.
[166:21.69]Yeah.
[166:23.23]What is this?
[166:26.75]100% natural state ingredients.
[166:28.61]Combat drink?
[166:35.20]What?
[166:35.86]What?
[166:42.43]Oh, it's these guys.
[166:43.19]It's the bridge guys.
[166:43.83]Alright, let's vortex them.
[166:46.75]I can just shoot them when they're doing that.
[167:07.52]Oh, that's kind of cool.
[167:19.74]It's a cool move, but I will tell you that's... That's really loud and really annoying.
[167:29.17]That's very loud, and I have to do that every time I want to do a move.
[167:37.36]Do storm two, then lightning one.
[167:48.50]Alright, where is it?
[167:54.14]Good job, boy.
[167:58.54]You look like cosplay Jack Sparrow.
[168:08.14]Yeah, I look like any convention Jack Sparrow.
[168:19.57]You know that guy that just dresses up as Jack Sparrow?
[168:22.07]Doesn't really matter what the convention is.
[168:26.43]This could be like a... Like a lawyer convention.
[168:32.65]A meeting of the attorneys at law.
[168:34.98]There would be a Jack Sparrow there.
[168:42.98]The Association of Restaurant Managers.
[168:45.70]Conference.
[168:46.98]There would be two Jack Sparrows there.
[168:57.92]Eat more food.
[168:58.60]I will.
[168:58.88]I just have to do some quests.
[169:06.35]You'll find it.
[169:08.39]Come on.
[169:08.67]You'll find it.
[169:09.13]Where is it?
[169:10.57]Where is it?
[169:11.19]Come on.
[169:11.59]Get it.
[169:12.91]Pick up the scent.
[169:13.59]You can do it.
[169:14.15]There we go.
[169:16.03]That's a good dog.
[169:18.84]I saw Jack Sparrow at 4th of July once.
[169:21.08]Right.
[169:21.28]It doesn't matter.
[169:21.84]Any large gathering.
[169:27.46]Guys, if there's too many people in line at the ice cream store, a Jack Sparrow will show up.
[169:39.12]Okay, so what do we got here?
[169:44.73]Let's go.
[169:55.87]This is Manure Manor.
[169:58.71]I can buy this right now.
[170:02.92]Owners killed.
[170:08.88]Knock on this door.
[170:10.45]If you want to commit vandalism, you could just... Good evening.
[170:16.29]Someone just tried to flirt with you.
[170:17.35]Who's flirting with me?
[170:24.82]Who's flirting with me?
[170:25.80]Oh, you still want me to leave?
[170:27.16]Oh, you want me to leave?
[170:31.78]Leave?
[170:32.06]Are you sure?
[170:32.46]Oh, yeah.
[170:32.74]Oh, you liked that a little bit, though.
[170:39.43]You sure you want me to leave?
[170:40.29]Well, I can do this.
[170:55.02]You love that though.
[170:56.00]What?
[171:10.03]You love me.
[171:11.37]You love me.
[171:12.09]What do they have in the fridge?
[171:14.60]Take everything.
[171:27.63]Got more shit?
[171:32.93]I'll be gone before they fucking even know I was here.
[171:34.85]Holy shit.
[171:39.75]What else do I have?
[171:40.39]Take it all.
[171:42.11]There's no guards in this town.
[171:43.40]There are no guards.
[171:50.34]Rancid water?
[171:53.54]What else you got?
[171:53.94]Sleep?
[171:54.08]Sleep?
[171:56.93]Wait, I'm sleeping in their bed?
[172:01.95]No, I don't want to do that.
[172:02.67]I want to get out of here.
[172:03.33]Alright, let's get the fuck out.
[172:09.36]Go, go, go.
[172:09.84]Out.
[172:09.98]Alright, we got out.
[172:31.81]I'm like a squirrel.
[172:33.90]I just stole a bunch of food in their house and I ran around the corner and like... Bob water.
[172:47.18]What does this do?
[172:50.22]I don't know.
[172:50.58]Drink it.
[172:50.92]What are those bells?
[172:56.16]Are those like rancid water?
[173:01.82]Smells like eggs.
[173:03.32]50 gold.
[173:06.98]Fine.
[173:07.12]Take it.
[173:07.58]Get out of here.
[173:12.82]That's nothing.
[173:16.16]Take it.
[173:26.33]My dad always wanted me to become a doctor, but breaking bones is just so much more fun than setting them.
[173:33.45]What is this?
[173:35.91]Woodcutter.
[173:36.71]Ooh.
[173:39.46]What happened to being a good boy?
[173:40.54]I can be a bad person, but a good boy.
[173:48.58]No, I can be a good person, but a bad boy.
[173:50.66]There you go.
[173:54.89]I'm a good person, but I'm a bad boy.
[173:59.69]You can also be a bad boy, but a good person.
[174:05.54]Good person, but... No, no.
[174:06.42]Say that in reverse.
[174:08.10]A good person, but a bad boy.
[174:09.48]A good boy, but a bad person.
[174:12.72]That's not me.
[174:13.36]I am a good... What's going on?
[174:15.32]Get away from me.
[174:22.53]Slow down and say it.
[174:23.39]Okay.
[174:24.83]You can be a good boy, but a bad person.
[174:32.00]That's not me.
[174:34.80]I am a bad boy, but a good person.
[174:38.42]Did I say the same thing twice?
[174:39.48]No.
[174:50.49]Say it slower.
[174:51.81]No, you get it.
[174:52.81]You know what I mean.
[174:55.22]Did I just get wood chips in that girl's eyes?
[175:01.76]I work for your dad.
[175:02.48]Get out of here.
[175:05.45]What?
[175:13.79]How am I going to get... I don't want to do another get promoted job.
[175:29.26]How are you a good person?
[175:30.18]Uh, I unlock that cage and let the person out, let the people out.
[175:35.42]All the time the bandits have been like, I'll give you free gold if you give me the warrants.
[175:38.73]Nope.
[175:51.93]I'm only getting eight gold for this shit.
[175:58.34]This is a horrible amount of gold.
[176:00.92]How have I been a bad boy?
[176:01.96]Um, I stole a bunch of stuff.
[176:05.50]I made a fart noise in front of somebody in front of like, uh, that person's- I went in their house, I farted and danced in their house.
[176:19.84]Multiplier has stopped at three.
[176:21.48]Oh, I've been promoted.
[176:22.52]Shit.
[176:31.52]That's bad person behavior.
[176:32.76]No, it's not.
[176:34.66]Bad person, bad person behavior is if I did not let them out.
[176:40.40]And I like made a deal with the bandit.
[176:46.80]You can be a good person, but a bad boy.
[176:56.26]Yes, I think you can be a bad person and a good boy.
[177:14.77]You drove a family out of their home and you stole their food.
[177:17.75]No.
[177:19.09]I danced so wildly entertainingly.
[177:22.95]By the way, all three of them loved it.
[177:27.08]That they ran away.
[177:27.92]Because they couldn't believe how fun it was.
[177:31.44]And they needed to go find all the people in the town to come watch me.
[177:38.23]And I just helped myself to the stuff that was in their fridge.
[177:51.83]Somebody said, go watch Megamind, you'll love it.
[177:54.85]Why would I like Megamind?
[178:06.58]Why would I wa- I don't want to watch Megamind.
[178:15.06]You know I wrote Megamind off?
[178:18.46]Because I just figured it was Will Ferrell movie number like 55 or whatever.
[178:34.85]Megamind's a villain like you.
[178:38.52]Why am I a villain?
[178:40.03]What did I do?
[178:40.47]Well, the only reason why you guys are saying Megamind was a good movie is because that's where penis music is from.
[178:47.93]That's false.
[178:59.50]No, it's not.
[179:14.62]Yeah, I probably would like Megamind.
[179:15.88]You're right.
[179:18.49]Maybe I'll watch it tonight.
[179:26.89]I'll watch it.
[179:27.29]Yeah, I'll watch it later.
[179:32.84]I will give you guys my assessment of Megamind tomorrow.
[179:36.62]Just kidding.
[179:37.00]I'm not watching that tonight.
[179:45.61]I don't need any more money.
[179:46.29]I'm good.
[179:47.49]I am going to buy this house, though.
[179:48.51]I'm buying the farm.
[179:52.72]This thing is only $2,800.
[179:54.06]$4,600?
[179:54.08]Should I buy it and move in?
[180:00.14]I want it.
[180:00.51]It's mine.
[180:03.39]This is my house.
[180:19.34]Animal magnetism?
[180:20.38]Alright, cool.
[180:31.35]So now I have a house.
[180:32.85]My house is the farm.
[180:35.75]I could rent it out, though, couldn't I?
[180:40.33]Rent out.
[180:40.75]How much could I rent?
[180:41.36]This is not a bad idea.
[180:53.41]I'll get $50 every five minutes.
[181:03.20]I'll take it.
[181:03.60]Alright, where am I going?
[181:12.22]You can improve it with decorations to increase the price.
[181:15.58]I slept in it for one day.
[181:17.16]Yeah, well, I need to have a family first.
[181:27.50]How much is this place?
[181:28.74]Please.
[181:29.04]6400?
[181:34.28]Anybody here?
[181:44.67]Open the door, then!
[181:49.61]Open the door!
[181:54.47]I have something very invo- I'm the goddamn quest guy.
[181:56.83]I'm saving this town.
[181:58.11]I need to ask you stuff.
[182:07.90]My head.
[182:08.46]Oh, I bet it's those damn kids and their pranks again.
[182:13.46]Oh, shit.
[182:17.69]And somehow, life becomes even more pointless.
[182:22.83]Nasty.
[182:31.88]Oh shit, they opened the door.
[182:37.48]Hello.
[182:37.80]I wonder if I could become a blacksmith.
[182:41.44]There must be some work going for that.
[182:44.42]Thank you.
[182:45.16]I have a master woodcutter.
[182:46.70]You're right.
[182:47.88]You should try Bowerstone Market.
[182:49.94]You think so?
[182:50.71]I love that, Mergo.
[182:52.61]It really brings some magic into our homes.
[182:54.77]If it's the brothel you're looking for, you've got the wrong place.
[182:57.81]Please leave.
[183:02.23]Why would you run to their bathroom?
[183:15.65]Why would you run to their bathroom?
[183:17.79]Who paid?
[183:18.15]Did they pay me?
[183:18.81]Why would I run out of their house?
[183:23.36]Run to the bathroom.
[183:34.34]Oh man, the, alright, what am I, where's the breadcrumbs going?
[183:39.70]Oh, I need more breadcrumbs.
[183:45.02]What's going on?
[183:48.58]Why are the breadcrumbs not... I need breadcrumbs, I can't function without them.
[183:59.02]What do I have to do to this guy?
[184:01.75]Whoa!
[184:01.97]Put it back!
[184:02.33]Put it back!
[184:02.81]Put it back!
[184:03.17]How do I put it down?
[184:03.67]Put it down!
[184:04.09]Put it down!
[184:04.63]Put it down!
[184:04.89]Put it down!
[184:05.17]Put it down!
[184:05.49]Put the gun down!
[184:06.03]Put it down!
[184:06.37]Put it down!
[184:07.15]Put it down!
[184:07.53]How do I put things down?
[184:09.27]Quick!
[184:09.47]Quick!
[184:09.67]Make somebody laugh!
[184:19.04]Nobody liked that.
[184:19.58]Alright, I have to get out of this town.
[184:23.10]Put that cookie down.
[184:24.88]No!
[184:29.06]Oh, look.
[184:29.46]This person likes me.
[184:30.50]You want to have tea?
[184:34.12]You alright?
[184:34.60]Okay.
[184:47.13]Do I have any presents?
[184:47.81]I do have a present, don't I?
[184:49.11]Just love you.
[184:52.01]Oh, thank you.
[184:52.53]You're the best.
[184:53.01]Thank you.
[184:55.91]Don't think he got what he wanted, though.
[185:03.66]Alright, so now how do I, um... I need info.
[185:10.99]Social.
[185:12.05]Uh, follow me.
[185:14.93]Come with me.
[185:17.17]Wait, what'd you say?
[185:20.43]What'd you say?
[185:21.09]Who said that?
[185:22.46]Did you say that?
[185:27.66]What'd you say?
[185:37.08]Yes.
[185:46.82]Game master?
[185:47.68]I can't.
[185:57.47]Play Spinnerbok a tutorial.
[186:01.02]A spinner box is a decorative box containing several devices called flit switches.
[186:05.84]A flit switch is a magical spinner that will randomly cycle through a variety of symbols.
[186:09.52]To play this, just place your bet and spin.
[186:14.27]What do I need to do?
[186:14.83]Okay.
[186:20.15]This is cow and corset.
[186:22.23]A three switch spinner box.
[186:24.51]Raise your bet to six gold and spin.
[186:26.69]Okay, spin it.
[186:30.70]I want to bet more than six.
[186:37.16]As you can see, not every spin's a winner.
[186:38.40]Two more adjacent symbols of the same type.
[186:45.15]Oh.
[186:49.83]There we go.
[186:51.30]Look at that!
[186:55.12]Bigger chains, okay.
[187:00.85]Oh, nice.
[187:01.27]Alright, let's go.
[187:04.51]Why can I not do a more than 10 bet?
[187:10.18]It's just fantasy slots, yeah.
[187:12.76]Look at that.
[187:13.12]Look at how much money I just made.
[187:14.38]600 gold?
[187:18.15]If I had bet 20 bucks, that would have been like 5 grand.
[187:31.22]Imagine needing a tutorial for a slot machine.
[187:33.14]Okay.
[187:42.92]Free spins.
[187:49.44]It's just a slot machine.
[187:50.36]Why do I even need a tutorial?
[187:56.73]Cool.
[187:56.87]Alright.
[187:57.11]Yeah.
[187:57.33]I get it.
[187:57.61]Alright.
[188:01.08]New payouts.
[188:01.70]Cool.
[188:03.42]Are we ready?
[188:04.04]Let's go.
[188:04.36]Alright.
[188:12.05]Adjust bet.
[188:15.01]What's the max bet?
[188:16.71]10?
[188:21.65]I can only put 10 bucks in here?
[188:33.98]Oh, there we go.
[188:48.65]Alright, let me make... Let me get a bonus and I'll leave.
[188:56.33]Pack it up, boys.
[188:57.31]No, pack... Stay here.
[189:06.25]We have to make the amount of spins larger.
[189:17.12]What is with these spins?
[189:24.84]How am I not winning any money?
[189:33.37]What the fuck is that?
[189:40.33]Fill the bank up.
[189:52.22]Got it.
[189:53.70]Alright, that's a super bonus cow spin.
[189:57.24]That's 500.
[189:57.60]I'm good.
[190:00.82]I'm still here.
[190:01.36]Let's go.
[190:06.74]One more of those and I'll leave.
[190:21.82]House, house, house.
[190:26.31]Oh, come on.
[190:28.93]It's timed?

[201:00.48]Oakfield is among the luscious regions of Albion.
[201:03.71]It owes its fertility to the extraordinary golden oak, which lives for only a few decades before producing a single golden acorn.
[201:12.35]The monks of the Temple of Light replant this acorn, and as the tree is reborn, so are all the lands and farms around.
[201:19.60]The abbot is quite nervous about this year.
[201:21.50]Oh, shit.
[201:22.24]See what you can find here.

[220:42.72]Wedding bells.
[220:43.66]Cheap flowers.
[220:44.12]Yeah, just get a bunch of random gifts.
[220:48.00]Oh, I like this.
[220:49.26]Is this a hat?
[220:50.82]Okay.
[221:13.31]I like this.
[221:15.61]You're making a great saving on that.
[221:19.49]Rock bottom prizes for rock bottom times.
[221:23.32]Okay.
[221:30.48]This looks like I had to become a superhero really quickly.
[221:36.60]I just kind of threw on everything I could find in like the closet for everybody that lives in my house.
[221:50.91]Alright, let's do it.
[221:56.09]Model for the sculptor.
[221:57.11]Yes.
[221:58.35]Perform and hold an expression.
[222:02.85]Well, I mean, we kind of have to... Yes.
[222:07.44]Your technique is astounding.
[222:11.04]Fantastic.
[222:12.57]I hope you can sustain this performance.
[222:15.57]Your behavior is most unpredictable.
[222:18.21]The model must hold their pose until told otherwise.
[222:25.61]Yes.
[222:26.63]Your technique is astounding.
[222:30.19]Fantastic.
[222:31.77]I hope you can sustain this performance.
[222:34.13]Keep farting.
[222:35.25]How perfectly statuesque.
[222:37.98]Keep it up.
[222:39.86]I gotta get out of the... Oh, wait, shit.
[222:42.04]I didn't win.
[222:42.46]Did I win?
[222:43.14]I hope it's me grabbing my butt.
[223:06.30]You can leave now.
[223:07.58]I must get started on the statue.
[223:09.72]I shall call it the semiotics of stillness.
[223:13.18]It should be ready next time you pass through.
[223:15.40]If it's a success, perhaps you can model for me again someday.
[223:18.69]This is gonna get me in trouble.
[223:26.11]I'm gonna shock somebody in the face.
[223:27.83]It's gonna get me in a lot of trouble.
[223:37.04]Oh, cool.
[223:37.52]Alright, nice.
[223:41.78]What's next on the quest?
[223:43.70]Alright, the ritual.
[223:44.58]Let's go.
[223:44.92]Alright, dog.
[223:53.15]Let's go.
[223:59.53]The demon door over here?
[224:01.42]Oh yeah, I remember those.
[224:02.16]It's like you have to do certain things in front of it.
[224:05.64]Ah, yes.
[224:06.82]You must be fat.
[224:08.42]You must be strong.
[224:09.70]You must be wise.
[224:11.03]I forgot about demon doors.
[224:22.33]Where is it?
[224:33.48]Yeah, the demon doors were the coolest part of the whole game.
[224:36.50]They were everywhere in the first game.
[224:40.50]Where are they in this one?
[224:49.19]Demon door, come on.
[224:58.48]Usually in the side of a rock cliff, right?
[225:00.48]Like something like in here.
[225:06.18]Honestly, the demon door was probably the coolest concept.
[225:10.52]I'm surprised nobody else decided to just take it and make a bunch of stuff.
[225:15.28]Make a game based around demon doors like Fable 1 was.
[225:19.27]It was such a cool idea.
[225:20.09]Follow the coast.
[225:33.54]Yeah, because it forced you to play a certain way.
[225:35.50]And if you didn't... Here we go.
[225:37.48]Alright.
[225:42.13]I'm married.
[225:43.31]Open the door, please.
[226:02.23]Oh, to get a glimpse of such love, even for just a few seconds, would inflate my soul with delight.
[226:10.56]A delicate kiss between pledged lovers is all that I ask.
[226:15.72]Such a sight would surely unlock my pain.
[226:19.13]Okay.
[226:19.33]Alright, honey?
[226:21.97]Honey, there's this weird thing in our backyard.
[226:34.38]Where's our house?
[226:34.90]Honey!
[226:35.22]Follow me.
[226:35.70]We have to open this door.
[227:04.96]Where is she?
[227:05.28]Where'd you go?
[227:07.98]Alright, honey, I need you to come with me for a minute.
[227:13.93]Alright, come with me.
[227:18.51]Follow me, please.
[227:19.13]Um... Follow me.
[227:29.28]Can I even kiss you?
[227:33.21]I can't even kiss her.
[227:34.15]How do I unlock kiss?
[227:38.15]How do I kiss her?
[227:39.61]How do I get the kiss expression?
[227:49.19]What?
[227:49.62]I have to go to the bookstore?
[227:54.10]Oh, God.
[227:56.82]Okay, well, just stay here then.
[227:58.84]Remind me if this exists.
[228:02.52]Very late!
[228:03.20]Okay, let's go.
[228:04.26]Remind me that exists.
[228:12.91]He doesn't even like you enough?
[228:17.45]We're married.
[228:42.78]It's a loveless marriage.
[228:44.20]Uh oh.
[228:53.52]Bandage.
[228:57.02]I have two keys.
[229:15.85]Minus 25.
[229:16.19]Oh, for the house.
[229:18.03]Temple of Light.
[229:34.76]Who are you?
[229:35.12]Whoa.
[229:50.78]Father, the sacred texts clearly say that only two monks may enter the cave.
[229:55.37]No one else.
[229:57.61]I'll not send my only child into unknown dangers without... What do you need?
[230:07.13]Hello there, my child.
[230:09.42]I wonder... Brothers, leave us.
[230:16.40]Let me take a look at you for a moment.
[230:19.96]Hmm?
[230:21.29]Armed?
[230:22.43]Quite imposing.
[230:24.13]But I can't send just anyone in there.
[230:28.65]I suppose danger is not everyone's cup of tea.
[230:32.38]You look imposing, alright, but I can't entrust our community's survival to a complete stranger.
[230:37.84]Why not?
[230:39.10]Perhaps if you built up a reputation, I'd be more inclined to trust you.
[230:44.38]Yes, Rookridge has been having a horrible time with bandits lately.
[230:50.21]Why don't you go to the tavern and see if you can do anything about them?
[230:53.56]That would be a good start.
[230:56.44]The blessing must go forward if you're to find the pilgrim.
[230:59.76]You must gain the abbot's favor.
[231:01.22]Oh, fine.
[231:01.88]Perhaps you can find a way to impress him in the town.
[231:04.40]Impress him?
[231:05.58]Use your map to see where quests and jobs are.
[231:07.86]I mean, he has a quest.
[231:13.47]A bridge too far.
[231:15.21]Fight the bandits in Rookridge.
[231:17.37]Sure.
[231:30.78]I don't have to go up here.
[231:31.54]Let me help you.
[231:34.53]Can I help you?
[231:37.27]You want a deed?
[231:38.49]You want to get a deed back?
[231:41.99]I can get a deed.
[231:42.51]You want to get a deed?
[231:44.73]I can get it.
[231:45.19]You want to get the deed?
[231:46.48]I can get the deed, man.
[231:57.53]So you'll get rid of all the bandits in Rookridge?
[232:00.21]Bet your ass I will.
[232:01.77]Wondrous.
[232:02.86]I knew I could count on you, old friend.
[232:06.20]Please be careful, though.
[232:08.20]These villains are a dangerous lot.
[232:14.51]I don't even need... Look, all you need to say is get rid of the people at this location.
[232:17.31]That's all you need.
[232:21.20]I don't need any other info, man.
[232:22.68]I'm gonna go literally blow their heads off with a shotgun and I'm gonna kill them with electricity and shit.
[232:28.44]Just wait.
[232:28.78]Don't worry.
[232:29.77]I'm the hero.
[232:33.93]Any Aaron chatters?
[232:35.85]Probably.
[232:36.19]Oh, you shitload of you.
[232:58.55]Okay.
[232:59.10]Bandits.
[232:59.72]Let's go.
[233:08.76]It didn't say it in the funny voice?
[233:12.72]No, that wasn't even the right one.
[233:13.72]There you go.
[233:15.93]You get that like once a week.
[233:23.15]Any treasure?
[233:23.63]Nope.
[233:23.87]Alright, what's on my bar right now?
[233:27.50]Vortex, yeah.
[233:28.48]You better believe it.
[233:30.30]Vortex into shotgun.
[233:38.64]Hell, the boss?
[233:42.40]Alright, let's go kick some fucking butt.
[233:55.57]Bring back Super Frog.
[233:58.89]I love Super Frog, it's like one of my favorite characters.
[234:06.14]That's it?
[234:07.42]Get him.
[234:09.65]Okay, come on down the stairs then.
[234:11.43]Let's make a tornado!
[234:28.48]It's a slow motion.
[234:39.55]Ow.
[234:52.07]Don't even use the weapon.
[234:52.83]What's the point of using the weapon?
[235:04.03]Oh, that's perfect.
[235:04.59]That's beautiful.
[235:05.46]That's awesome.
[235:09.58]What's this shit?
[235:10.40]Why I'm around?
[235:11.00]It's Apple.
[235:12.78]Shotgun.
[235:22.51]You think you're gonna catch me?
[235:24.47]Why'd you think they'd call me Dash?
[235:26.75]Stupid!
[235:27.85]I love this voice.
[235:28.63]How could I have run the guards before I was out of nappies?
[235:31.83]What chance have you got?
[235:34.51]The last idiot who tried to chase me went blue in the face and killed over.
[235:38.41]And I was already miles away.
[235:39.94]I love this guy.
[235:41.42]I could shoot your smug mug all day long.
[235:46.34]Sorry, scum.
[235:47.42]Gotta dash.
[235:59.76]Come on, boy!
[236:08.74]What the hell?
[236:09.61]His voice is so wild.
[236:10.99]I love it.
[236:13.79]I've never heard that guy before.
[236:17.17]What the fuck?
[236:26.46]Vortex is pretty helpful.
[236:44.49]I'm just eating.
[236:45.11]This guy's in a lot of TV shows?
[236:59.48]Really?
[237:04.67]When is he going to kill the baby?
[237:07.63]I know most of you are probably only still on this stream.
[237:11.65]You're only probably still here.
[237:13.95]Because you are thinking at some point, I'm going to have safety off, and I'm going to kill the baby.
[237:20.26]I think that's why a bunch of you are still here.
[237:23.72]Because you don't want to miss when, like, the guy kills the baby.
[237:27.18]You know what I mean?
[237:27.64]Like, it's not going to happen, though.
[237:29.64]I'm not happening.
[237:30.72]Okay.
[237:41.61]Like, I really doubt that's going to happen.
[237:52.90]Oh my gosh.
[237:54.41]I'll be immoral away from you before you die already.
[238:11.63]Ow.
[238:29.85]Is he dead?
[238:34.69]My god, that guy took so many hits.
[238:40.72]Imagine getting your ass kicked by a guy that looks like this.
[238:47.74]If anybody's shooting lightning out of their hands.
[238:51.11]You're wasting your time, you drowsy slug.
[238:55.01]Rook reaches mine, you hear?
[238:57.03]I'll use your blood to paint the side with my knife.
[239:00.71]Whoa.
[239:01.41]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[239:03.85]It's in the fucking tornado.
[239:08.42]Let's go.
[239:26.38]Heal the dog?
[239:27.30]I'll get it, I'll get the dog.
[239:28.02]Alright, come here dog.
[239:35.60]I have a dog treat for you, right?
[239:36.82]Come here.
[239:38.28]How do I do it?
[239:39.22]Can I not do it?
[239:40.74]Use dog elixir.
[239:41.68]I don't have a dog elixir, do I?
[239:42.86]I thought it said feed and kill the bandit dog.
[240:00.65]Alright, I want shock 2.
[240:02.91]Yep.
[240:05.55]I had to spend all my money, but I want it.
[240:09.76]How about speed?
[240:12.04]Accuracy?
[240:13.26]Yeah.
[240:18.62]Alright, how much better is this?
[240:24.87]So if I have level 2...
[240:29.29]Alright, so we're gonna have to change this, I think.
[240:30.59]I want this to be lightning and we'll do... Yeah, because that's kind of cool.
[240:37.24]And then we get them with the thing and we just fucking zap them.
[240:40.00]Perfect.
[240:40.26]Alright, let's go.
[240:50.58]Oh, do you like this game?
[240:51.62]Yeah.
[240:53.48]It's keeping my attention.
[240:54.38]It's funny.
[241:04.18]Resurrection file.
[241:07.21]Keep one of these in your inventory.
[241:08.77]Should your health drop to zero, the resurrection file will automatically revive you.
[241:13.29]Well, that's kind of a big deal.
[241:14.71]Alright, let's go.
[241:17.31]It's a funny fart game.
[241:18.29]Of course we like it.
[241:21.79]I mean, that's how I keep you guys here.
[241:25.29]Have you noticed that I've done a fart?
[241:26.89]I've, like, farted into the microphone.
[241:30.90]Like, every, maybe, 30 minutes or so, it gets to keep you here.
[241:41.48]Ooh, I like it.
[241:42.28]It's good.
[241:53.44]Where's my dog?
[242:13.14]You can tell the health of the dog by the tail.
[242:22.88]We would be here regardless.
[242:23.93]Hey, that's pay.
[242:24.79]Thanks.
[242:26.53]Would you?
[242:27.07]That's cool.
[242:28.09]Thanks.
[242:28.35]Oh, the dog's on him.
[242:29.37]But I killed him?
[242:31.17]What?
[242:47.23]I guess, I mean, I guess that that would kill him.
[242:49.15]Your map can give you information about regions, points of interest, and much more.
[242:53.72]I suggest you look at your quests now.
[242:56.44]Oh, okay.
[242:56.76]When you select a quest, it becomes your... Whatever.
[243:02.14]No boss fight?
[243:02.96]I guess not.
[243:08.89]100 bucks?
[243:10.45]Bandit bandana?
[243:11.37]Bandit shirt?
[243:13.89]Bandit trousers?
[243:16.37]I'll just sell this shit.
[243:17.25]I don't want to get... I want to have, like, a big gown on.
[243:23.43]I need a big, like, mage gown.
[243:24.91]Alright, well, that was good.
[243:29.04]So now I go back and, um, talk to that guy.
[243:30.90]Okay.
[243:36.33]Return to Bonham.
[243:46.56]You killed him and took his clothes.
[243:55.17]I pretended to like this game because my crush liked it.
[243:57.73]Yeah, but it's really, it's not a bad game.
[244:08.80]It's fun.
[244:21.54]Alright, hey, look what I did.
[244:22.78]Hey, what do you like?
[244:26.82]Yeah, what do you like?
[244:28.02]I'm trying to hit triangle for more info.
[244:30.86]I don't want to shoot the guy.
[244:33.66]He likes... What do you want?
[244:36.90]He wants a gift?
[244:39.50]Heroic pose, sock puppet, and shoulder length hair.
[244:48.57]How do I, um...
[244:58.10]How do I get the present?
[245:00.72]Do I have a present?
[245:02.23]You must be very proud to be a parent.
[245:07.21]Ah, the hero returns.
[245:09.45]A stupendous success.
[245:11.91]Jolly well done.
[245:14.09]Of course, turns out those words weren't entirely genuine.
[245:17.61]So the toll thing isn't going to work out quite as planned.
[245:22.43]Still, at least it's not me who has to rebuild the bridge now.

[248:02.17]I just want to throw a tornado in there.
[248:26.49]We have what you need.
[248:29.47]What are you looking for?

[248:30.91]No.

[248:45.60]Bandit trousers.
[248:47.94]Don't want it.
[248:50.86]Someone will be able to use that.
[248:57.88]You know what I mean?
[248:58.83]I know, I said that a lot.
[248:59.67]I know.
[249:03.15]Do I have enough renown to do what this guy wants me to do?
[249:08.67]Will death do us part?
[249:10.25]Speak to the ghost of a jilted lover and become its instrument of vengeance?
[249:19.94]What do you mean, looking for a new model?
[249:26.36]Statues in front of the inn?
[249:27.86]Oh.

[249:53.74]I need to buy another house.
[249:56.87]I'll let him get the jump on me.
[250:12.89]Come on.
[250:15.64]In the head.
[250:21.16]I can now afford speed.
[250:23.88]Not yet though.
[250:29.17]I just want to let you know, I bet my house on whether you're going to die to the bandits in 30 minutes.
[250:33.21]Please.
[250:33.43]Well, it's been four and a half hours, man.
[250:35.53]I don't think I'm going to die to the bandits.
[250:43.74]I am.
[250:43.92]Glad of you to notice.
[250:45.50]Ugh!
[251:03.55]Oh, good shot.
[251:04.31]Uh-oh.
[251:09.61]Alright, I gotta run.
[251:10.69]I gotta get up there.
[251:11.65]Why are you role-playing?
[251:18.56]It's alright.
[251:25.04]I can't pretend like I'm in the game and just be like, oh, got ya.
[251:28.16]Sit down.
[251:28.88]Why not?
[251:29.20]I do that shit all the time.
[251:41.92]you know I still can't figure out the life of me why they do that why do they do that have they ever played a video game before like why do they do like the pretend like actor wearing a vent call thing I but it's I don't under nobody talks like that
[252:05.65]We all have played a shitload of games together.
[252:07.89]We've played games in parties, online, even in just random lobbies.
[252:14.33]People don't do that.
[252:15.87]No one has ever... I don't think the people making that have ever played a video game online.
[252:29.33]But, I mean, what's the alternative?
[252:32.84]The alternative is, I guess, how it would really be
[252:36.47]Which would be turn your volume down really low because somebody's going to have a horrible microphone and scream into it.
[252:41.65]You're going to hear somebody get yelled at by their mother.
[252:45.17]You're going to get like the lapel microphone sounds.
[252:54.04]That is the alternative.
[252:57.65]And maybe every like two or three minutes you'll hear the fuck, dude.
[253:06.78]Fucking help me fucking idiot Fuck is it Or or this Now what's more interesting like oh watch out watch your six oh

[253:47.38]Can you see me?
[253:48.16]Can you see me?
[253:50.36]Oh, my statue.
[253:51.42]Oh, finally.
[253:53.04]I've been wondering this place so long.
[253:55.67]So lost.
[253:57.73]So angry.
[254:01.29]I need to find peace.
[254:03.58]I need to find justice.
[254:05.32]Maybe you can help me.
[254:08.43]Oh, it's a Jerma985 stream.
[254:09.77]There's going to be a fat guy if it's possible.
[254:12.09]The pain that still keeps me in this world.
[254:14.97]My God, Kubrick's there.
[254:17.83]I was going to get married, you know, to Alex, the prettiest girl in town.
[254:26.20]We spent...
[254:30.25]Picking out the flowers, choosing the food, the music, the words we'd speak.
[254:36.25]And then the big day came.
[254:37.61]And... What happened?
[254:45.25]The big day came and what?
[254:49.47]Will you help me?
[254:50.56]Alright, I'll help you.
[254:54.44]Yes.
[254:55.78]Excellent.
[254:57.14]It won't be easy, though.
[254:58.66]You'll have to make her fall in love with you utterly and completely.
[255:02.03]But I have a wife.
[255:04.75]Then, when she's ready to accept your proposal, when she can't imagine her life without you, give her this.
[255:13.35]Why don't I just, like, tell this guy to fuck off?
[255:15.33]Rejection note?
[255:16.76]Dear Alex, it's time for you to know the truth.
[255:18.28]I don't love you.
[255:18.88]I've never loved you.
[255:19.54]This was all a game for me.
[255:20.50]You are empty and deceitful, and I hope you never find the slightest glimmer of happiness in this life.
[255:25.94]Are you blue?
[255:43.44]Wedding bells?
[255:48.06]Oh, okay.
[255:55.83]The art of seduction.
[255:56.85]I have to read all these books.
[256:06.15]Alright, books.
[256:08.09]The mage.
[256:09.90]The mage follows where wisdom leads, but always into conflict.
[256:13.76]Okay.
[256:13.98]Making an ally of this hero will cost you much.
[256:20.06]Uh, the pilgrim.
[256:21.48]The relic.
[256:22.14]The thief.
[256:23.30]The rejection note.
[256:24.46]The temple of shadows.
[256:25.52]The end.
[256:25.96]Hold on.
[256:26.36]Temple of shadows.

[257:33.93]You'll have to watch.
[257:34.51]15?
[257:34.53]Is that 15 or 5?
[257:42.38]Wait, I have 5 silver keys?
[257:47.24]When did I get 5?
[257:47.86]I thought I had like 4.
[257:50.94]Oh shit, nice.
[257:58.28]Alright, let's go seduce.
[258:10.43]Here we go.
[258:12.41]Where is Alex?
[258:19.03]Who did that?
[258:19.49]I didn't do that.
[258:28.36]Get the kiss emote.
[258:29.62]It's a book in this library.
[258:30.70]Okay.
[258:32.96]I'll get it.
[258:33.30]I feel like the breadcrumbs in this game were made for gamers like you.
[258:44.67]They were.
[258:45.07]I wish it was in every game.
[258:50.78]What was that game where you could, if you pressed, like, down on the D-pad, it was like, and it did a little line in the ground?
[258:57.25]Dead Space.
[258:57.87]Yeah.
[258:58.21]Oh, my God.
[258:58.81]Dead Space is, like, the best game ever made.
[259:00.25]You don't, you only use it when you need it.
[259:08.95]It was awesome.
[259:09.69]You never got lost.
[259:10.80]It was perfect.
[259:11.44]Oh, I want you to pay attention, gamer.
[259:13.24]I, no, I don't care.
[259:14.18]Just show me where to go.
[259:14.80]Alright.
[259:20.87]Oh, I didn't see you there.
[259:22.55]Hi, I'm here to talk to you.
[259:23.97]Isn't it amazing?
[259:25.51]All these people, they look so happy, don't they?
[259:29.65]I'm sorry.
[259:30.83]Don't mind me.
[259:32.15]My name's Alex.
[259:33.87]Hi.
[259:35.83]I'm sure you're a really nice person, but I'm not really much of a talker these days.
[259:40.62]Okay.
[259:48.26]Let's see.
[259:52.49]Wait, what?
[259:56.23]Oh, gambling.
[259:56.79]Hold on.
[260:04.11]Keystone.
[260:07.21]Oh, it's roulette.
[260:08.23]I don't remember all this shit in this game.
[260:24.48]I think I have an idea of how this works.
[260:31.11]Okay, I want... Let's go 15.
[260:40.81]Inside bets.

[261:20.14]What's that?
[261:20.48]8.
[261:21.14]What's that give me?
[261:28.76]Wife and child are at home eating rotten food.
[261:33.40]Fifteen.
[261:33.92]Twelve to seventeen.
[261:38.01]Run.
[261:38.31]Roll dice.

[262:02.36]Thank you.
[262:02.84]This is close enough.
[262:08.71]What's that pay?
[262:09.73]Twenty-five!
[262:10.41]Hey, you can't lose if you put it on, like, almost everything.
[262:37.31]Oh, fuck.
[262:47.46]Oh.
[262:57.58]Oh, get more chips.

[263:44.90]140.
[263:44.92]Let's go.

[263:51.25]Ten.
[263:51.49]Pear.
[263:54.43]And... Keystone.
[263:56.41]I don't even know what that means, but sure.
[264:00.84]There it is.

[264:15.27]Keystone.
[264:15.71]Pear.
[264:17.61]Go.
[264:21.24]There it is.
[264:22.30]I can't fucking count.
[264:23.46]No, I can't do math.
[264:24.92]I can't do math ever.
[264:26.12]It's impossible.
[264:26.66]Ten.
[264:34.20]Eleven.
[264:35.32]Keystone.
[264:35.92]Pear.
[264:37.88]And trips.
[264:42.67]That's trips.
[264:43.33]No, it's not.
[264:59.69]Come on, put it on there.
[265:03.45]I mean, if I get triples, that's probably like 101.
[265:05.65]There we go.
[265:09.61]Alright, that's a big deal.
[265:11.62]That's a big deal.
[265:13.92]That's 80, that's 40, that's 100, that's not even that much.
[265:16.14]Crips will hit huge if it lands.
[265:27.25]Alright, I'm done.
[265:33.80]I'm done.
[265:34.00]This is stupid.
[265:51.17]Okay, 1600 points to the next level.
[266:00.28]Build up a ton of debt.
[266:01.84]I feel like that people will come after me.
[266:04.44]Alright, where's the lady I need to seduce?
[266:08.40]I don't remember even who it is.
[266:12.90]Alex.
[266:13.16]Okay, there we go.
[266:16.26]Good stuff.
[266:18.66]Terrific.
[266:19.62]Amazing.
[266:22.71]Alright, what do you like?
[266:23.95]She doesn't like play dead.
[266:25.47]Oh, I have flowers.
[266:27.29]Freshly picked flowers.
[266:29.15]I have them.
[266:33.51]Don't I?
[266:33.81]I have cheap flowers.
[266:36.41]Here.
[266:37.27]Oh.
[266:51.87]Alright, let's go.
[266:56.30]Come on.
[266:58.38]That was the magic bullet voice.
[267:00.44]That was absolutely fantastic.
[267:05.08]And you have here a virgin strawberry.
[267:07.83]That's well done.
[267:12.88]Why does it want me to fart now?
[267:14.70]So creepy.
[267:25.93]You're really quite something.
[267:28.45]Okay, convince her to marry you.
[267:31.69]I'm just the luckiest woman in the world.
[267:34.07]I never thought I'd find happiness again.
[267:35.75]I never thought I'd deserve it.
[267:38.51]There's something I've never told you.
[267:41.79]I almost got married once before.
[267:44.39]He was a sweet boy, but we were both so young.
[267:47.95]Too young.
[267:48.47]I got scared and ran away the day of the wedding.
[267:53.82]I hurt him so badly.
[267:55.88]He took his own life.
[267:57.34]I've carried that guilt with me all these years.
[267:59.74]Never dreaming I could love again.
[268:01.02]Can I get some fucking space?
[268:02.51]Get away from me.
[268:03.11]What do I do?
[268:11.01]Destroy the rejection note.
[268:13.21]I have a wife and kid back at the house.
[268:30.45]Somebody just wrote, dude, what the fuck?
[268:32.37]Why is your character so gross and weird?
[268:34.39]I don't know.
[268:35.24]I don't know why that made me laugh so hard.
[268:38.70]Kill this person?
[268:39.68]No!
[268:40.16]I didn't kill her.
[268:43.02]Can you be married twice?
[268:44.06]Would you like a drink?
[268:55.29]The temples of light and shadows are always at each other's throats.
[269:00.72]Is he- does he- You're engaged?
[269:02.82]What?
[269:03.08]Wait, can I bring her back to the- to my house?
[269:06.36]Wait a minute.
[269:06.76]Wait a minute.
[269:07.26]That- Do I need to like- I don't understand.
[269:09.50]Can we go back to the other property?
[269:31.36]Can I bring her back?
[269:36.26]Leave me the fuck alone.
[269:38.90]So can I evict myself?
[269:43.25]Can I evict myself from the other house and then move in?
[269:47.99]What happens to the baby?
[269:48.93]Yeah, I have to buy another house.
[269:54.93]Oh god, okay.
[269:55.55]I don't have any money.
[270:02.84]How much is this one?
[270:04.68]Okay.
[270:05.00]I don't have enough money.
[270:05.82]Just hold on.
[270:06.56]Let me go blacksmith for like a half an hour.
[270:10.26]Okay.
[270:10.38]Hold on.
[270:10.58]I'll be done in a minute.
[270:35.45]Have another baby?
[270:36.25]So wait, you're telling me that I can just have like a bunch of children with a bunch of different people?
[270:46.02]I don't remember doing any of this in the game.
[270:53.72]I just need to get to like six or seven grand.
[270:59.81]This is not gambling.
[271:00.65]This is done.
[271:01.57]It's a job.
[271:02.19]I can do it.
[271:04.69]Not gambling.
[271:14.07]Create your family line.
[271:15.37]I feel like I'm going to get confused.
[271:20.40]I'm going to forget who is who.
[271:26.14]Alright.
[271:34.41]This is going to not take that long.
[271:35.59]I just can't fuck it up.
[271:44.14]Alright, don't screw it up.
[271:50.49]Alright, wait for one rotation.
[271:57.61]No need to rush.
[272:01.05]You idiot!
[272:01.63]I just told you not to do that and you did it anyways!
[272:05.81]I was just talking to you.
[272:08.03]Listen to me.
[272:08.75]Why did I do that?
[272:12.57]I'll get it.
[272:25.12]It's because needing to wait that extra one second for some reason is an eternity in my brain.
[272:31.25]It's like, oh, it's so much.
[272:32.85]It's so long.
[272:33.79]I have to do it.
[272:38.65]You know what I mean?
[272:39.21]Like, it's just a hundred years in my head.
[272:41.31]Oh, okay.
[272:41.77]I need, what, ten grand?
[272:49.20]I'll get it.
[272:50.72]Okay, we're good.
[273:08.26]We're gonna be here all day?
[273:09.20]No, we're not.
[273:10.20]We have, like, another five minutes.
[273:12.72]Holy shit.
[273:13.38]Okay, I almost screwed it up.
[273:20.95]Look at how shitty that is.
[273:23.62]Look at that.
[273:24.26]Do you see how weirdly that's moving?
[273:26.06]It's, like, wicked framey.
[273:38.53]Oh, that sucks.
[273:40.37]Oh.
[273:45.33]Somebody's going to make me laugh.
[273:46.95]You just made me laugh, but I have to pay attention.
[273:48.87]I don't even want to say it out loud because it was really, really funny.
[273:51.78]Okay.
[273:53.90]I'm going to say it, but I'm going to make sure I pay attention to the game.
[273:56.86]Somebody said this is the music from British Bake Off.
[274:00.34]And it is.
[274:01.04]It is.
[274:10.31]No, not ZZZZ.
[274:14.61]I can't believe somebody found that.
[274:18.53]Alright, this is a good combo.
[274:24.24]Don't fuck it up.
[274:24.72]600 per sword.
[274:38.82]Fuck, oh my god, I'm just stupid.
[274:41.38]Why would I do that to myself?
[274:43.56]There's no reason to do that.
[274:46.20]Oh my god, why am I doing that to myself?
[274:59.19]Sorry, I had to.
[275:05.19]Just a man working hard to cheat on his family.
[275:14.88]Ten grand.
[275:18.18]Alright, don't, I'm not, alright.
[275:23.04]If I, I have to do this, I have to say this, otherwise I won't stop.
[275:27.77]If I don't wait for one bounce, add 50 billion dollars to the debt.
[275:35.41]Okay, that's the only, I'm forcing myself to do that.
[275:37.15]It has to be one bounce.
[275:39.80]Okay.
[275:50.45]See?
[275:50.87]Now I forced myself to do it.
[275:52.05]There's like a devil in my brain that's like, press it!
[276:02.21]Press it now!
[276:03.46]Nope.
[276:05.02]I won't do it.
[276:06.60]I'm not gonna do it.
[276:07.16]We're good.

[278:08.78]Dancing.
[278:10.05]It's funny.
[278:10.41]It's because I have a bunch of money?
[278:22.97]Okay, I want my present.

[307:38.46]Where are you running towards with the guns?
[307:40.86]This way, please.
[307:41.74]This way.
[307:42.26]Excuse me.
[307:43.60]Yep.
[307:44.02]You're fine.
[307:45.44]Oh, my God.
[307:48.85]Okay.
[307:49.21]Go home.
[307:49.75]How do I take you to go home?
[307:59.67]Alright.
[308:00.11]Go.
[308:00.33]Dismiss.
[308:01.15]Go.
[308:03.45]Dismiss.
[308:10.48]Dismiss.
[308:20.26]You know.
[308:20.57]Okay.
[308:21.23]Don't.
[308:22.77]Why are you going this way?
[308:25.85]Okay.
[308:26.19]Thank God.
[308:30.52]Alright, we're good.
[308:43.50]Ow.
[308:43.70]Let's go.
[308:44.02]She's... Where are you going?
[308:55.85]Honey, honey, you need to go the other way.
[308:57.65]Oh my god, she's fucking so stupid.
[309:01.81]Get!
[309:02.27]Dismissed!
[309:02.91]Dismissed!
[309:03.35]Dismissed!
[309:03.83]Dismissed!
[309:04.59]Dismissed!
[309:05.09]Dismissed!
[309:05.87]Yes, you're going- do you see what's happening over here?
[309:07.99]Not a good place to run.
[309:11.67]Don't come over here.
[309:14.73]Okay, good.
[309:25.54]Ow, shit.
[309:26.04]Oh my god, honey, I'm gonna die.
[309:36.16]I gotta run this way.
[309:40.10]New plan, new plan, run!
[309:41.26]What are you doing?
[310:07.69]I lost the game.
[310:08.39]I did not lose the game.
[310:09.61]I'm fine.
[310:25.84]What do you even do in this game?
[310:26.98]Kind of a combination of everything.
[310:34.38]Nice.
[310:34.74]They had...
[310:38.42]Nice!
[310:38.78]Alright, good.
[310:41.82]You know, I'm going back to Lightning.
[310:47.13]I think she's still following me.
[310:49.76]Where is he?
[311:10.90]Okay.
[311:12.64]I guess you're just gonna keep following me, so might as well let you just follow.
[311:20.24]Here we go.
[311:22.64]I'm back.
[311:23.50]And I was a dick.
[311:25.56]So, you fell in love with her, did you?
[311:29.35]The strange thing is, I'm not mad anymore.
[311:33.63]I feel at peace.
[311:37.37]I asked you to do such a terrible thing...
[311:41.12]Wait, what does that part mean?
[312:07.93]He takes a step away and comes right back.
[312:09.55]Ooh.
[312:11.90]Well.
[312:12.16]That didn't take very long.
[312:19.78]Beware the ghost.
[312:24.59]Alright, that's 100 renown.
[312:27.51]Is she still here?
[312:28.05]If she's still here, then we can probably leave.
[312:33.47]Are you still here?
[312:37.26]I think she left.
[312:42.05]Okay, now I have to go back to that town and then travel with her to the other house.
[312:54.11]She's dead?
[312:54.51]What do you mean she died?
[312:55.72]What are you talking about?
[312:56.34]Where?
[312:58.32]There's probably one shooting at you.
[313:15.71]Oh, okay.
[313:16.69]Well, let's go.
[313:18.33]That is a gigantic quest marker.
[313:26.14]Uh, the sculptor.
[313:30.68]I want to go back to, what is it, Bowerstone?
[313:45.68]The girl that died.
[313:47.82]One of them died.
[313:50.82]I have to get the kiss book, you're right.
[313:57.79]I don't think they both died.
[313:58.69]I sent one of them back, remember?
[314:05.39]What's going on in the house?
[314:07.43]I've been gone for a little while.
[314:08.67]Hello?
[314:15.81]Okay.
[314:16.81]Where is he?
[314:29.84]Where is he?
[314:33.04]Where'd he go?
[314:33.98]Hmm.
[314:57.80]I think I'm down.
[315:03.51]Hello!
[315:05.29]Uh, what's your name?
[315:07.43]Hello, Amy!
[315:08.19]I thought I had a loot.
[315:12.65]I swear to God, I had a loot.
[315:13.94]Okay.
[315:31.21]All we need to get married is a ring.
[315:45.62]What are you... Who am I even doing that to?
[315:49.51]Is anyone in the area?
[315:50.53]Am I doing it in the mirror?
[316:14.90]Alright, where's the kiss book?
[316:18.98]Onion!
[316:24.70]Onion!
[316:26.06]Onion!
[316:27.96]Onion!
[316:33.42]Alright, I need to pick a new quest.
[316:38.70]I have to go visit... No, where's this other person?
[316:41.47]Where'd the other girl go?
[316:43.17]The other lady?
[316:46.07]What?
[316:53.13]The other person died?
[316:57.86]Okay, well, I need to go back to my other house and see how my other, like, family's doing.
[317:07.10]Right?
[317:07.32]Like, I need to see the families, too.
[317:11.98]Alex is unhappy.
[317:14.83]Your family has a gift for you.
[317:20.53]Holy shit, you ever gonna play the game?
[317:37.69]Oh, that's right.
[317:41.29]I did the ghost quest.
[317:43.67]That whole thing was the ghost storyline.
[317:54.50]Alright, let's see how this family's doing.
[317:58.76]Alright, family.
[318:03.35]Dad's back.
[318:08.85]I'm back.
[318:09.99]I'm here to chop wood and watch football.
[318:17.45]Hello, honey!
[318:18.79]Darling, you've been so wonderful lately, I got you this gift.
[318:26.87]Thank you.
[318:27.31]That was little baby Kieran, right?
[318:43.42]Kieran is the baby's name, right?
[318:47.70]Oops.
[318:54.18]Kiernan.
[318:55.66]I said it wrong.
[319:03.34]Okay, we're good.
[319:09.32]Now, let's do the quest.
[319:13.04]The ritual.
[319:13.64]Talk to the abbot in Oakfield and impress the abbot by earning renown.
[319:17.84]How much renown do I need?
[319:20.12]Oh, return to the abbot.
[319:20.99]Okay.
[319:39.14]I'm pretty famous now.
[319:40.12]I think you'd let me do whatever you wanted.
[319:42.50]What was I supposed to do?
[319:43.16]What the fuck are you doing?
[320:12.76]I'm sorry, you're very large.
[320:14.36]The golden acorn is done with holy water from the well spring of light.
[320:19.52]But the spring is located in a nearby cave, which is said to be quite dangerous.
[320:25.88]Our sacred text says two monks must enter this cave, the strongest and a second of the abbot's choosing.
[320:34.40]Obviously, this concerns me, especially since the strongest monk here is my own child.
[320:40.82]So instead of a second monk, I have chosen to send a protector for the first.
[320:46.17]And that's you, if you're interested.
[320:49.61]The cave is just at the end of this road.
[320:52.07]You have to talk louder when it's a waterfall, dude.
[320:56.91]You probably passed it on your way here.
[321:00.15]Our strongest monk will be waiting for you when you're ready.
[321:08.00]Alright, are you the... Are you the monk?
[321:13.11]Even if they do not yet realize it.
[321:16.55]Benjamin the monk.
[321:27.83]You're a dancing loon.
[321:37.48]Easy game, just dance, that's alright.
[321:39.10]The monk.
[321:55.97]What are you- Honey, what are you doing?
[321:58.25]Wait, what is he doing out here?
[322:00.17]What the fuck is going on?
[322:01.34]Why are you out here?
[322:03.16]What?
[322:07.23]I'm so confused.
[322:16.13]Who is that?
[322:16.69]What?
[322:33.34]What if we kissed at the demon door?
[322:35.83]So you're my escort then?
[322:40.15]My father said you'd be coming by.
[323:02.93]Hey there, boy.
[323:04.43]Hello.
[323:06.21]Oh, you're a strong, handsome fellow, aren't you?
[323:10.68]I feel better having you with me in that cave.
[323:13.18]Yes, I will.
[323:16.38]Are we related?
[323:17.28]I feel like we're related.
[323:19.72]We look alike.
[323:20.80]We have the same face.
[323:23.68]They're not.
[323:25.29]But I can't do much about it because monks make a Solemn Vow never to bash anyone's face in.
[323:30.56]Did my father mention that?
[323:32.56]Yeah.
[323:34.24]Whatever fighting's to be done in there, it's all yours.
[323:36.90]I have to do all the fighting?
[323:38.44]We'll require a hero, not a pacifist monk.
[323:43.30]We'll need her to find a reason to fight.
[323:45.34]I don't mind telling you I'm a bit envious.
[323:52.00]You get all the excitement and I get to carry this bloody thing like some sort of mule.
[323:57.63]I mean, look at it.
[323:58.73]It's enormous.
[324:00.85]Golden or not, how much water does a bloody acorn need?
[324:04.45]I love water.
[324:05.73]I love water.
[324:07.04]I like how American English... Water.
[324:12.00]Water.
[324:13.20]Water.
[324:14.04]Doesn't that sound nicer?
[324:16.70]Water.
[324:17.10]Water.
[324:17.98]Water.
[324:31.35]All Americans are from Boston.
[324:33.03]Well, I said water and then I said water.
[324:35.19]I said water.
[324:43.40]No one else has been in here for maybe a hundred years?
[324:47.66]Well, no monks anyway.
[324:49.82]Don't worry, I've got an action.
[324:51.45]I guess an adventurer or two could have come in, but if they got out alive, I didn't hear about it.
[324:59.89]How much longer am I going to stream for?
[325:01.15]Um... What did I just do?
[325:04.74]I just drank something for no reason.
[325:06.18]Stay with us where it's safe.
[325:11.06]Where's the dog?
[325:11.58]Am I puking?
[325:15.08]What's wrong with me?
[325:15.58]Look up there.
[325:21.15]They look lovely.
[325:22.81]I think they're called wisps.
[325:25.33]Souls of the dead who have left this world.
[325:28.51]It's actually rather sad, isn't it?
[325:36.35]You are a quiet one.
[325:39.23]Watch your step, doggie.
[325:40.31]Looks a bit steep here.
[325:42.55]Do you reckon we'll run into anything nasty in here?
[325:46.17]I mean, a dark creepy cave is a hell of a place for a holy spring.
[325:51.13]Especially for an order of pacifists.
[325:54.48]You know, I've heard of monks in the north who believe that to transcend violence, you have to understand it first.
[326:02.35]So instead of praying... Violence.
[326:04.31]Violence.
[326:05.57]Violence.
[326:06.11]You think that's the path to inner peace?
[326:09.21]Sometimes I think, what if the bloke who founded the Temple of Light had believed that?
[326:15.45]Or what if I'd been adopted by the warrior monks instead of my dad?
[326:20.44]My life would be completely different right now.
[326:24.26]Exactly the same person.
[326:26.16]Just change where I was brought up and I get totally different beliefs.
[326:29.52]What's that?
[326:38.03]Uh-oh.
[326:43.39]Alright.
[326:44.39]This should be the central chamber.
[326:47.26]Stay on guard.
[326:47.82]Open it up.
[326:48.69]Stand on that and I'll get in.
[327:17.80]Fable 1, Fable 2, Fable 3, 3, 3, Fable 3, Fable 2, Fable 3, 3, 3.
[327:26.40]Is Diablo II remake out yet?
[327:39.88]I wish.
[327:48.02]Oh, say it again?
[327:50.38]Water?
[327:51.38]Water?
[328:00.79]I stand here so I can catch it.
[328:03.77]And you need to stand on that one.
[328:07.15]Get it!
[328:11.34]Right, there it goes.
[328:13.99]Oh, yeah.
[328:15.03]I can feel this thing getting even heavier.
[328:17.67]That's nice, that is.
[328:19.93]So far, this isn't too bad.
[328:21.31]Is your character portrayed by John Candy?
[328:26.43]I really hope they find someone else to do this next time.
[328:30.23]Mind you, I'll be an old lady by then, so I'm probably off the hook.
[328:35.03]You know, this is probably going to be the highlight of my life.
[328:39.45]The day I carried a jug through a cave.
[328:43.12]Shit, look at that.
[328:43.80]You did hear something.
[328:44.42]Oh, a silver key.
[329:14.24]Oh my gosh, guys, he farted.
[329:16.62]Did you hear that?
[329:17.04]He farted.
[329:17.80]Fuck, I didn't even test to see if the audio was synced.
[329:36.15]I didn't even test to see if the audio was synced this entire game.
[329:43.32]Fuck.
[329:44.92]God damn it.
[329:46.16]I need to test this.
[329:46.74]Okay, ready?
[329:49.22]Down.
[329:50.28]Up.
[329:51.18]Down.
[329:52.23]Up.
[329:53.15]Down.
[329:54.09]Down.
[329:55.07]Down.
[329:55.63]Is it synced?
[330:04.98]Is it major desync?
[330:06.54]Is it close enough?
[330:07.14]It's like, it's like one and a half seconds off delayed by like a 0.6 seconds up, down, up, down, down, down.
[330:18.23]Why one second?
[330:24.64]Okay.
[330:24.90]So do you hear me first?
[330:26.14]Do you hear the game?
[330:27.42]Do you hear what happens first?
[330:34.31]How about this now, how about, ready?
[330:35.61]Up.
[330:36.59]Up.
[330:37.45]Down.
[330:38.41]Down.
[330:39.43]Up.
[330:40.41]Up.
[330:41.33]Up.
[330:41.79]Down.
[330:42.35]Down.
[330:47.50]Better?
[330:51.26]Alright, good.
[331:03.33]Go!
[331:03.47]Go!
[331:08.60]Super. Super macho man.
[331:20.60]Oh shit people have been gifting a ton of fucking subs. I haven't been paying attention I'm sorry.
[331:32.60]No no somebody said it. I have to say it now. Ah. Okay I'll do it.
[331:38.58]Guppie J. EA.
[331:38.90]I just ate a bunch of fucking rotten pies.
[331:45.47]Up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up
[332:01.09]I like this game, but it's kind of really fucking annoying.
[332:04.27]That, um... Like, it might look, like, very simple on the screen, but every time to do a spell, I have to go up, up, up, up, up, down, down, down, down, up, up, up, up, up, down, down, down, down, down, A. It's like Mortal Kombat.
[332:13.36]It's fucking so annoying.
[332:27.21]Spells in this game suck.
[332:28.23]Why'd you tell me to... 71% of you told me to be a magician.
[332:31.77]No.
[332:32.03]Behind you!
[332:33.39]Wait, what?
[332:59.23]Thank the gifted subs.
[333:00.43]Thank you.
[333:00.91]Thank you.
[333:03.17]Thank you.
[333:03.51]Thank you.
[333:03.83]Thank you.
[333:04.87]Thank you, pal.
[333:05.29]I appreciate it.
[333:29.90]Thank you, Bal.
[333:31.74]Thank you, Balson, for the 20 community subs.
[333:43.35]Thank you, Chef Lazarus, for the 10 subs.
[333:47.73]Unionize your workplace.
[333:48.57]Thanks for 20 community subs.
[333:49.59]Thanks a lot, guys.
[333:50.25]It's not their name.
[333:50.91]Their name is
[333:59.62]Alison.
[334:02.94]I'm gonna stand up here and use my fucking magical tune.
[334:20.04]The bard plays magical tune.
[334:59.99]Easy.
[335:02.27]Game's easy.
[335:25.67]The blade spell?
[335:26.71]Maybe next time.
[335:28.11]We'll see.
[335:35.82]Oh, let me come down there.
[335:36.78]I'll help you.
[335:37.34]Are they gonna kill her?
[335:52.69]How do you miss point blank?
[335:56.35]I can turn safety off and kill her?
[336:00.14]What?
[336:04.28]Toughness.
[336:06.50]Hold on.
[336:10.54]I get the shock three.
[336:15.47]Blades.
[336:18.83]Let's do blades.
[336:20.21]Blades one and blades two.
[336:28.98]And let's also do...
[336:34.08]Hmm.
[336:37.46]Speed.
[336:41.68]Blades are broken.
[336:45.59]Oh, nice.
[336:47.73]Low level spells are now more powerful.
[336:49.35]Alright, what do we got here?
[336:52.43]Let's do blades two.
[337:00.50]Oh, shit.
[337:00.92]Okay.
[337:01.08]Okay.
[337:04.96]Holy shit, that's cool.
[337:05.84]Alright, so should I keep, um... Alright, here's what we're gonna do.
[337:13.61]Oh, that's awesome!
[337:14.45]Alright, Blades 1 and Vortex 2.
[337:18.65]So I'll Vortex 2 everybody.
[337:21.06]And then we'll drop fucking Blades everywhere.
[337:39.55]Yes.
[337:40.43]I'm always ready.
[337:44.25]Turn safety off.
[337:44.85]Uh-oh.
[337:45.21]Just unlearn Chaos.
[338:05.97]Chaos III or Chaos V is probably really good.
[338:13.19]He's back.
[338:14.91]Here he comes.
[338:17.24]Yeap, yeap, yeap, yeap, yeap, yeap, yeap, yeap.
[338:19.46]Dino, what'd you find?
[338:22.18]Oh, God.
[338:23.22]What you got there?
[338:28.30]Oh, that is disgusting.
[338:35.21]Oh no, but you're a good dog for attacking him.
[338:38.47]Who's a good boy?
[338:39.80]Who tears their heads off hollow men?
[338:42.86]We're supposed to cheap and OP.
[338:44.74]Is it you boy?
[338:47.38]I'll check it out.
[338:48.12]Shall we?
[338:48.55]Ever boss, right?
[339:09.31]See ya.
[339:15.09]Yeah.
[339:15.31]This is awesome.
[339:16.59]Why did I not just... Okay.
[339:18.33]Why would I ever use another move?
[339:32.44]Bro, I've been trying to tell you.
[339:33.64]Yeah, I know, but still.
[339:36.98]I need to level up strength.
[339:39.60]We have to get strength up.
[339:40.56]Because I need more health.
[339:46.55]This health bar is so awful.
[339:47.89]Oh, that was sick.
[340:03.56]Okay, I played Fable 3 or maybe like an hour or two, three hours or so, and I thought it was absolute dog shit.
[340:10.40]Am I misremembering this or did I just get bored of the franchise or something?
[340:13.79]I remember not being good.
[340:14.73]Should I play it?
[340:22.95]No, it does suck.
[340:27.33]Headless Hollow Man.
[340:30.30]You have enough experience to buy something.
[340:31.76]Okay, well.
[340:32.24]Why is this so hard?
[340:33.75]He's like the easiest enemy in the whole game.
[340:38.51]Why does he have his own cutscene?
[340:40.10]The guy can't even see us.
[341:04.69]That was a boss?
[341:05.25]It was the worst one, but I still liked it.
[341:10.17]Table 3 is still worth playing.
[341:27.45]Yeah, I just didn't... They added like a follower system or something, right?
[341:30.45]Where you could open chests if you had a thousand followers, two thousand followers, ten thousand followers, something weird like that.
[341:36.70]No, it isn't.
[341:37.14]What am I... I'm... That happens.
[341:38.22]That's the level system.
[342:09.38]Sister Hannah.
[342:13.20]The monks are evil.
[342:15.06]What is it?
[342:16.92]It's your father.
[342:18.40]One of Lucian's men.
[342:19.86]He's holding him hostage at the temple.
[342:23.03]He's got a gun.
[342:25.25]I got one too.
[342:25.87]Let's go.
[342:28.75]I have to save my father.
[342:30.17]I wish I could run faster.
[342:33.11]Come on.
[342:34.03]We have to get to the temple.
[342:37.36]One of Lucien's agents has come to the temple.
[342:39.58]Go after her.
[342:41.68]And thank you, Balson, again, for the 20 community subs this time.
[342:44.66]Thank you, Balson.
[343:03.39]Able One's the only one that's worth playing.
[343:05.89]Um, I think this one's good.
[343:09.45]This is a good game, but if you played this when it came out... This game promised so many things.
[343:19.16]I remember looking at developer commentaries and hype videos about this game.
[343:24.06]Everyone thought this was going to be the world's greatest video game.
[343:32.69]There was going to be an entire living, breathing Earth in this game.
[343:38.74]And it ended up being like a 12 and a half to like 14 hour action game that had like a marriage system.
[343:47.26]It was not that big of a deal.
[343:49.34]I remember watching a video of, like, holy shit, dog.
[343:52.12]I remember watching videos of, like, Peter Molyneux talking about, if you plant this tree here, it will grow and you could have a forest.
[344:01.91]And I think there's one cutscene that happens in the course of this entire, like, 15-hour experience where, like, trees grow in a cutscene.
[344:09.16]And that's it.
[344:19.06]It was definitely for Fable 2, because Fable 1 was good, but he didn't have time to really hype it up like he did.
[344:34.01]Wait, who's talking?
[344:37.19]I'm missing important shit.
[344:41.79]Where is this person?
[344:43.97]Oh, goddammit, I missed an entire thing.
[344:45.83]Where are they?
[345:01.04]He hyped it up the same way.
[345:03.80]Yeah, but I remember thinking Fable 2 was gonna be the world's... Don't make me kill you too.
[345:20.54]I missed that too.
[345:21.38]World's worst cameraman.
[345:22.82]Oh my god.
[345:23.52]Lana...
[345:30.58]I COULD HAVE STOPPED HIM!
[345:34.59]YOU IDIOT!
[345:36.39]YOU STUPID FOOL!
[345:38.73]I COULD HAVE STOPPED HIM IF I... I'm sorry, Father.
[346:00.55]Not that I broke my vow.
[346:02.69]I'm sorry I didn't break it sooner.
[346:04.47]What is this?
[346:05.63]I never did fit in at this place.
[346:08.02]We both knew that.
[346:10.04]And now I'm making a new vow.
[346:12.46]Lucien will die for what he did to you.
[346:15.82]I won't break this one.
[346:17.46]Why am I doing like the you put another t-shirt on in The Sims character creator?
[346:24.23]You do it.
[346:26.29]As new life rises.
[346:28.33]So shall we.
[346:30.33]As the seed returns to the Earth, so do we all.
[346:35.40]No, don't step on it.
[346:36.70]I'm trying to move it.
[346:37.66]Okay, there's like an invisible wall right here and it just fucked me up and I walked on it.
[346:41.16]I didn't mean to do that.
[346:41.90]I swear to God.
[346:42.50]Is that it then?
[346:44.06]There's an invisible wall right here and it like blocked me and fucked me up and I walked over here.
[346:48.20]It's flourishing again.
[346:50.34]It's an invisible wall.
[346:51.04]Look, I'm proving it right now.
[346:52.18]Our life just goes on as before, does it?
[347:00.50]The other monks may believe that but your eyes have been opened Where did you come from?
[347:06.90]Who are you?
[347:08.88]Someone who can tell you much about Lucien Where he is what his plans are and how you can gain your revenge if you will listen.
[347:19.00]I Want to know everything Then come with me sister.
[347:22.84]I can't there's no farting.
[347:24.02]I can't do anything me hammer
[347:30.64]Thousand renown, holy shit.
[347:32.14]Cool.
[347:49.66]You have gathered the first of the three heroes.
[347:52.55]And we are one step closer to defeating Lucian's plans.
[347:55.11]I'm not going to fart.
[347:55.77]That's... No.
[347:57.07]I have to... I'm not doing that.
[347:58.51]That's not nice.
[347:59.29]That's not a good boy move.
[348:01.21]You know...
[348:14.36]So, this game was cool.
[348:16.78]I think Dark Souls, games like Dark Souls, especially just when Dark Souls came out, that like changed everything about how like an action-adventure, melee kind of spell game was played.
[348:29.83]Man, would I love a game that has this kind of Fable 2-like world and systems, but Dark Souls level of game kind of mechanics.
[348:46.59]Imagine a game that has, like, the world with all these, like, different, like, permanently being able to kill people and the quests and stuff, but it's like Dark Souls.
[349:00.48]I would love, like, a Fable slash Dark Souls.
[349:03.04]Oh, I would love it.
[349:08.74]Isn't this my house?
[349:13.04]Holy shit, I'm so sorry.
[349:14.56]Oh my god.
[349:25.76]Quick.
[349:30.05]Wait, hold on.
[349:30.57]What's... While they're out.
[349:33.51]While they're out.
[349:33.91]While they're out.
[349:34.33]Just steal everything.
[349:34.91]Quick.
[349:37.77]No, get out.
[349:38.31]Just get out.
[349:38.89]What?
[349:39.17]No.
[349:39.41]They might have something under the bed.
[349:44.92]I can buy the house.
[349:45.50]I can buy the house.
[349:46.02]I can buy the house first.
[349:47.12]And then it's not illegal.
[349:52.94]How much is this place?
[350:03.05]Holy shit!
[350:21.76]Oh no!
[350:22.29]Acho!
[350:23.57]Are you okay?
[350:32.61]Swim to Mexico.
[350:33.83]Alright, I'm good.
[350:40.51]They're like bees, they're not gonna come in the water.
[350:42.77]Oh, what are you gonna do?
[350:52.23]What are you gonna do about it?
[350:56.35]Oh no, what happened?
[350:58.53]You can't come and get me in the water?
[351:02.92]No, break us!
[351:36.90]Is the dog gonna bite him?
[351:44.67]He's like, what should I do?
[351:47.03]Should I bite him?
[351:47.71]Alright, bite him.
[351:48.15]Bite that guy.
[351:48.43]Bite that guy.
[351:48.83]Bite him.
[351:49.29]Bite him.
[351:50.13]Bite him on the leg.
[352:04.89]Bite that guy!
[352:05.79]Bite him!
[352:06.65]Stop!
[352:07.19]I command you!
[352:11.24]Come here!
[352:19.40]I wonder if I can get him to go in the water.
[352:22.85]Will he drown if he goes in the water?
[352:28.83]Stop or you'll regret it!
[352:41.21]alright I'm gonna try something they're running in circles alright alright I gotta go it he's there get him
[353:09.96]Where the fuck am I going?
[353:11.80]Oh shit.
[353:12.46]Why am I going this way?
[353:14.56]Oh shit.
[353:15.18]Oh my God.
[353:15.52]Oh my God.
[353:15.84]Oh my God.
[353:16.10]Oh my God.
[353:16.40]Oh my God.
[353:17.37]Oh my God.
[353:17.71]Oh my God.
[353:18.09]Oh my God.
[353:18.45]I just shot him.
[353:20.35]I shot a guy.
[353:20.77]What happened?
[353:22.41]What happened?
[353:27.47]Wait, what?
[353:39.89]What just happened?
[353:46.21]It was 200 gold?
[353:46.83]Ow, alright.
[353:47.74]I gotta relax.
[353:56.10]Ugh.
[354:15.69]Relax, relax.
[354:16.57]I don't want to get into, like, a fucking coughing fit here.
[354:23.35]I can't.
[354:27.11]Imagine shooting somebody in the fucking chest twice, and the guy turns around and he's just like, well, you can pay me $250.
[354:35.97]That's so fucking funny.
[354:36.49]Ugh.
[354:46.09]I can't- I can't kill him?
[354:48.75]Settle down.
[354:49.43]Settle down.
[354:50.75]I'm gonna settle down.
[354:51.49]That was- I could have started to overthink that and laugh about that.
[354:55.93]I gotta relax.
[355:01.14]Um... Very well.
[355:06.92]You've paid your debt to society.
[355:10.88]Now then, you better not be planning on using that weapon.
[355:16.18]I want to put this weapon away.
[355:19.03]Is he about to limp?
[355:23.99]What the fuck?
[355:24.72]Hey!
[355:26.92]What's he doing?
[355:48.10]Who did he shoot the gun at?
[355:53.18]What's going on over here?
[355:54.26]What the hell is happening?
[355:58.88]Wait, oh, they were bandits.
[356:01.25]Oh, they were bandits attacking.
[356:06.53]Wait, why is this happening?
[356:12.51]Why are there so many people?
[356:17.33]What's...
[356:19.58]What's happening?
[356:20.78]It's like a fucking brawl.
[356:31.10]Wait, who's dog?
[356:31.98]Oh, that's my dog.
[356:40.82]This is just the purge.
[356:54.77]Alright, I'm done.
[356:55.65]I'm done after this.
[356:56.37]I'm getting out of here.
[357:06.32]Okay.
[357:08.62]Safety on.
[357:14.18]I mean, the guy, like, literally was like, ah, thanks for paying the fee, bastard.
[357:17.62]And then he aimed the gun and just started firing at somebody.
[357:26.02]Oh, shit.
[357:38.41]Yeah, he's a guard.
[357:39.19]I don't know.
[357:39.99]I thought he was, like, shooting at my dog.
[357:41.43]I don't know.
[357:41.77]I thought he was firing at somebody that I was connected to somehow.
[357:45.43]Because he was, like, still aggroed to me.
[357:46.93]I thought he was still aggroed to my character somehow.
[357:50.19]And, like, was shooting at the dog.
[357:51.83]I don't know.
[357:52.29]Okay, we're good.
[358:06.71]Still, I still think that's so funny.
[358:08.91]Two like fucking slugs in the chest and he's just like, I'll take 250 if you just want to keep walking.
[358:14.56]That's got like 12 holes in his body.
[358:18.98]How do I get out of here?
[358:34.66]I'm sorry your honor, I thought he was still aggroed on me.
[358:50.86]Your spouse is threatening divorce?
[358:56.15]Where do you see that?
[359:00.61]Look at the size of you.
[359:02.57]It's a wonder you can move at all.
[359:04.09]Keep walking.
[359:07.95]Keep walking.
[359:08.67]My reputation's already awful.
[359:10.59]Who's a good boy?
[359:14.32]What's wrong?
[359:16.36]What's going on?
[359:18.54]Well, I can't say I missed you.
[359:23.46]I wouldn't expect a gift from you.
[359:25.84]You're so thoughtless.
[359:27.84]All we need to get married is a ring.
[359:31.05]I got a gift.
[359:36.91]Pretty necklace.
[359:41.49]We're fine.
[359:46.30]And I'm going to do your favorite thing.
[359:51.96]The fist pump.
[359:54.46]Oh, shit.
[359:54.80]That's wrong wife.
[359:57.30]But I think you'll still like it.
[360:02.55]Isn't this your daughter?
[360:06.81]What?
[360:07.19]No.
[360:07.31]What are you talking about?
[360:08.39]What?
[360:08.55]No, it's not.
[360:11.33]Alright, so how's the baby?
[360:32.59]Okay, everything's fine.
[360:34.73]See, everything's fine.

[364:22.30]I didn't take a piss one time.
[364:23.50]No, you're right, I didn't.
[364:27.96]You most certainly will not.
[364:29.24]No, I probably will not.

[364:37.21]Okay, let me, I gotta level up.

[366:45.38]Oh yeah, we'll play this again tomorrow.
[366:46.60]I'm not going to start at like 4 o'clock.
[366:49.93]Like today.
[366:51.25]It was just a bunch of stuff I had to do today.
[366:52.71]Before we start around 2 o'clock Pacific.
[366:57.71]Yeah.
[366:58.57]That sounds good to me.
[367:06.60]This is a lot of fun though.
[367:09.18]It's fun just, I mean, I don't feel like I haven't really done very much, but I've enjoyed the whole time I've been playing.
[367:15.54]That's how you make a blade.
[367:20.87]We'll do more missions tomorrow.
[367:25.91]We'll do some more story stuff tomorrow.
[367:27.75]I spent the whole time just fucking around.
[367:29.15]It was very fun.
[367:37.35]I'm a good boy too.
[367:41.21]That's one complete blade.
[367:48.07]Yeah, I only got one hero.
[367:49.23]I need two more heroes.
[367:51.41]And look, if I don't beat it tomorrow, you know, it's all good.
[367:56.05]I don't need to beat Fable 2.
[368:01.49]We'll play it for like another six, seven hours tomorrow and see where we are.
[368:10.08]You're doing a good job.
[368:15.48]Yeah, you know, everyone knows it's coming.
[368:18.26]End of the stream voice.
[368:19.20]Yeah, Hasan raided the stream.
[368:23.77]If any of you are still here, thanks for checking out the stream.
[368:34.84]And again, I will reiterate this next Sunday is going to be something very interesting.
[368:42.09]I don't know exactly what it is, but I've been told it's going to be a nice, really, really great time.
[368:47.09]I don't really know what that means.
[368:52.61]Keep hitting it like that.
[369:03.32]He's going to play Among Us next Sunday.
[369:05.06]Oh, God, no.
[369:07.76]He said he's going to raid the guy who never streams, and it was you.
[369:15.53]I mean, I stream like once or twice a week.
[369:24.19]Raid the guy who never streams.
[369:25.95]Raid the guy who never streams.
[369:36.35]Now, I told you, the only way I would play Among Us... Is if I did an Imposterous Sus Guy Plays Among Us.
[369:44.79]And tried to get, like, 100,000 community subs.
[369:49.99]And just do, like, a massive sellout.
[369:51.87]Like, I'm the Imposterous Sus Guy.
[369:53.63]Like, look at how cool this is.
[369:55.01]I'm playing Among Us.
[369:57.21]But the reason why I never decided to do it...
[369:59.62]Was because that means that all those people stay.
[370:02.68]And it will never go away.
[370:05.16]You know how many people, if I were to do an imposter is sus guy stream.
[370:09.71]They would show up.
[370:11.03]They would be like, imposter is sus guy.
[370:12.59]They would never leave.
[370:14.13]And it's the only thing I would be asked to do for the rest of my life.
[370:26.08]What about the numbers?
[370:28.02]Yeah, some things just aren't worth that much money.
[370:30.64]You know what I mean?
[370:31.16]Some things are really just not worth it to me.
[370:34.23]That's one of them.
[370:36.27]I don't really care.
[370:37.85]I don't want like a fucking 100,000 imposterous sus community subs.
[370:53.42]That's how you make a blade.
[370:56.58]It would be wicked cool.
[370:58.78]This is a thousand bucks for every single one of these I'm doing.
[371:02.64]I haven't missed once.
[371:03.27]I think of the debt.
[371:14.46]No, I'm not.
[371:15.14]I would never do it.
[371:23.60]That's integrity?
[371:25.14]Um... I... I don't think so.
[371:27.54]I think I just don't want to have to look in my Discord and see 500 messages a day saying... Is he going to do another Among Us stream?
[371:34.92]When's the sus guy going to do it again?
[371:37.08]Where's sus guy?
[371:38.20]Where is he?
[371:38.64]That stream was so good.
[371:39.78]Do it again.
[371:40.42]Why is he not doing it tomorrow?
[371:41.99]Do it now.
[371:43.51]Every stream.
[371:46.13]Where's Among Us?
[371:47.33]Why would the Among Us guy not play Among Us?
[371:50.71]That makes no sense.
[371:53.95]It would be a tear through this community.
[371:58.82]Don't know.
[372:11.47]It would be funny.
[372:12.39]I think it would be funny for like a couple hours, but I really don't want to have to bait people into being here thinking that I'm going to be streaming Among Us and that they stay.
[372:34.71]I'm almost about to be level five blacksmith.
[372:42.39]You're over exaggerating on the impact it would have.
[372:44.33]I know.
[372:47.43]Why do I think that's such a huge deal?
[372:49.27]It just isn't.
[372:49.83]That meme is so old and like dead.
[372:52.80]It doesn't even matter.
[373:03.16]Alright, I'm going to be level 5 for tomorrow.
[373:06.82]There it is.
[373:14.39]Level 5.
[373:14.71]Alright, I might as well just go until I can't.
[373:19.81]It's not dead.
[373:20.37]It's on its way out, though.
[373:28.19]Is Among Us still relevant?
[373:29.41]I really don't know.
[373:31.86]I don't know.
[373:34.66]Okay, I thought I was married to the town crier for a second.
[373:36.92]I was like, how did that happen?
[373:45.71]Alright, let's see how much money I can get doing it at level 5.
[373:48.61]Oh, right, I fucked it up.
[373:56.01]Yeah, I'm calling it here anyways.
[373:57.46]We're calling it.
[373:59.58]We'll pick up tomorrow with like 20,000 gold.
[374:02.24]And we'll do the next mission.
[374:10.20]Change the title of the Town Crier?
[374:11.34]People don't like Salad Dodger.
[374:22.93]Oh, I also want to talk about this too.
[374:24.25]This is very brief, but this is things to be excited about.
[374:26.77]I am pleased to announce today that the third quarter of this year is going to be fucking insane.
[374:36.58]There are two streams.
[374:38.28]I'm not going to go into detail of what they are at the moment because I don't really need to.
[374:41.36]I don't want to.
[374:42.36]In August and September, both of them are going to be bigger than the carnival.
[374:46.34]Both of them.
[374:47.52]So in August and then right after that in September, there's going to be two streams.
[374:52.86]And they're both larger in scale than the carnival.
[375:01.59]And you know what?
[375:02.37]Fuck it.
[375:02.63]I'll just say it.
[375:03.07]One of them is baseball.
[375:04.09]Yeah.
[375:06.07]We are so close.
[375:07.47]We are so close to completely locking that stream down.
[375:12.63]And I'm so happy that we are.
[375:16.58]I can't fucking wait.
[375:19.03]I don't have any hard dates yet, but we are so close.
[375:26.53]That's going to happen somewhere in quarter three.
[375:30.84]There's another stream that's going to be bigger than that that's happening somewhere probably in quarter three as well.
[375:42.07]I can't wait.
[375:46.96]You will get dates for these streams within the next, I would say the next two weeks.
[375:52.98]I will have probably hard dates for both of these streams.
[375:58.36]There's also the Grotto Beasts cards.
[376:05.58]Those are coming too.
[376:07.64]Hopefully soon as well.
[376:14.46]It's going to be fully loaded.
[376:15.64]I told you back in, uh, because of COVID, like three streams had to get completely just dumped.
[376:23.77]Oh, that's it.
[376:24.43]Now let me get 20,000.
[376:25.25]And now that we're really kind of turning the, uh, the book in the chapter on that, uh, a lot more opportunities came up and a lot of these streams were pretty much done.
[376:39.54]The baseball stream was ready to go.
[376:42.50]We were two weeks away from it happening.
[376:44.76]Before it was just too risky.
[376:47.22]There was a bunch of the spikes in a lot of the places, and it was just like, we can't.
[376:51.53]We just can't fucking do it.
[376:52.55]I don't want to do it.
[376:54.27]So we lost.
[376:54.93]I spent money on that stream, and it just never happened.
[377:02.14]But I can't fuck around.
[377:04.76]But now, that's coming back, and I can't wait.
[377:09.57]So there's a couple of streams that were pushed forward.
[377:13.71]And you'll see them at some point in August and September.
[377:15.80]Alright, 20,000 and I'm out of here.
[377:29.03]Oh.
[377:31.33]See you next weekend.
[377:32.55]See you next Sunday.
[377:34.35]I'll be live tomorrow, but still.
[377:36.91]See you next Sunday.
[377:41.88]You promised to watch Megamind.
[377:43.10]Well, I didn't promise to watch Megamind.
[377:44.68]I said I would consider it.
[377:45.62]Alright, only a few more.
[377:49.81]Is that Otto?
[377:53.57]Did Otto just bark at the door?
[377:54.95]Hold on.
[377:58.32]Otto?
[378:01.36]Is that you?
[378:02.16]Alright, that's it.
[378:09.70]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[378:11.54]We'll call it here.
[378:13.78]You promised to watch Megamind.
[378:15.16]Alright, I'll watch Megamind and I'll let you know how I think.
[378:22.58]Alright, let me save the game.
[378:23.42]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[378:25.00]Let's run the credits.
[378:26.54]Thanks for all the community subs.
[378:27.50]There were a lot of them from that Balls guy gave a lot of money.
[378:32.39]It was like 50 community subs from Balson.
[378:36.41]Thank you.
[378:42.10]And as always, everybody else today.
[378:46.70]Thanks to Hassan.
[378:47.36]Thanks to Chibli.
[378:48.24]I missed this as well.
[378:48.96]This is a raid.
[378:51.12]I think I was in the middle of doing something and didn't see it, but Chibli, thanks for the raid.
[378:55.88]There's about 500 of you came from Chibli.
[378:57.62]Thank you.
[379:00.08]Yeah.
[379:10.04]Yeah, see you guys tomorrow.
[379:13.25]Let me save and continue to go.
[379:21.14]Credits are off-center.
[379:22.12]I know.
[379:23.36]I'm just terrible.
[379:25.32]Let me see if I can fix it right now.
[379:29.23]Got it.
[379:29.45]There you go.
[379:30.31]Look at that.
[379:31.11]Perfect.
[379:40.09]864P Andy.
[379:40.63]That's me.
[379:41.07]Ooh, did I just turn the stream off?
[379:42.37]Nope.
[379:50.00]Can't wait for more polygamy and blacksmithing.
[379:55.06]No, not tomorrow.
[379:55.96]I'm going to do missions tomorrow.
[379:57.32]I'm going to actually go bang, bang, bang, bang, bang and do story stuff tomorrow.
[380:01.21]Because I want to progress the game.
[380:15.52]Am I going to finish it?
[380:16.84]I don't think I'm going to be able to finish it.
[380:19.98]We'll get pretty close.
[380:23.54]But I don't think that I'm not going to do like a 10-hour stream tomorrow to finish Table 2.
[380:30.90]We'll see how far we get.
[380:36.89]Do 1080p?
[380:37.99]No, you don't want to do 1080p on Twitch.
[380:42.21]To have good 1080p video, you need to have a bitrate that's higher than Twitch allows.
[380:47.78]That's why I was in 720p for so long.
[380:51.64]720p, 6000 bitrate is good.
[380:56.10]The more resolution you go up, if you don't increase your bitrate, it just looks worse.
[381:01.85]So I have not increased my bitrate because I'm at the maximum.
[381:07.61]What I did is I dropped my CPU preset until I can do NVENC.
[381:12.44]And then I'm going to make it so that runs essentially through that.
[381:18.23]Uh, so yeah, 1080 just is probably never going to work until Twitch, like, I guess, officially allows for, like, 10,000 to 12,000 bitrates, which I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon.
[381:34.14]But 864 is where I'm going to go for now.
[381:40.46]Thanks again, everybody.
[381:41.04]I'll see you tomorrow.
[381:41.48]Have a great night.
[381:44.92]Your server costs would just go way up, yeah.
[381:47.64]I really doubt that would happen.
[381:48.82]Do you have any plans for the 10th anniversary of your career?
[381:57.18]You made it sound like huge plans were to be had, the big anniversary milestone.
[382:01.30]Um... I mean, not particularly, but there's like two or three streams that you're gonna see, like, after June.
[382:09.98]July.
[382:10.20]July.
[382:13.34]I mean, there's just massive, massive amounts of work and time going into them.
[382:17.24]So I guess you could say that these couple of streams coming up are kind of big deals, at least for me.
[382:24.76]Being here for 10 years.
[382:25.50]I don't have anything particularly planned.
[382:29.55]Like the exact day.
[382:31.55]I'll probably just be like, oh, nice.
[382:39.83]Yeah, it's been 10 years.
[382:40.81]That's insane.
[382:44.49]I can't believe people have stayed watching this channel for 10 years.
[382:47.19]That just... It blows my mind.
[382:54.76]Hey, thanks you.
[382:55.88]Thanks you.
[382:56.70]Thanks you, boy.
[382:57.54]10 community subs right at the end here.
[382:59.68]Appreciate it.
[383:04.40]Have a great night.
[383:04.88]I'll see you tomorrow.
[383:08.86]Take care of yourselves.
[383:10.73]And goodbye.
[383:32.20]you
