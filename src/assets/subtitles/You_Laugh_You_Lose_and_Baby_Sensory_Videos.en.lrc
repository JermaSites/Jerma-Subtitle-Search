[00:01.81]Oh, this is a disaster.
[00:02.69]I don't even have my lip balm.
[00:03.85]This is a disaster.
[00:04.77]Give me one second.
[00:07.90]This is a disaster!
[00:10.40]One sec.
[00:52.21]That's like the weirdest tweet I think I've ever made.
[00:54.03]What a fucking weird tweet.
[01:00.78]You laugh you lose in baby sensory videos today.
[01:03.46]We've come a long way from uh... From I'm playing spy on upward today.
[01:09.78]What's going on here?
[01:20.07]Okay, that's my mic.
[01:21.21]My mics in a weird place.
[01:22.01]I got some new monitors.
[01:24.03]And I'm in the process of making them getting them set up in a good spot.
[01:28.13]And I messed up where my microphone is.
[01:33.57]I can't even stream.
[01:34.35]Yeah, I can't even stream today.
[01:35.54]I'm gone.
[01:37.62]This is too much.
[01:38.26]This is too much for me.
[01:39.62]I'm gonna go.
[01:40.04]Yeah.
[01:41.94]Okay.
[01:46.65]I gave you some updates on some things because I think you deserve them.
[01:48.83]It's been four or five days since I've said hello to you.
[01:53.16]An update on the New Year's Eve stuff.
[01:57.50]I... These nominations obviously have been closed for about a week.
[02:02.56]Going through the process of eliminating a bunch of these nominees has been ridiculous considering, if I'm accurate, I believe there were... And this is after going through a first pass-through.
[02:15.26]Right?
[02:15.56]So, everybody nominates shit.
[02:17.68]We do a first pass-through of, okay, duplicates and stuff that just really doesn't belong there in that category.
[02:23.62]Doesn't belong here.
[02:24.32]Eh, no, no, not this one.
[02:26.48]After the first pass-through, there's like, I think, like 50 best noise nominees that are still there.
[02:34.38]So, I have to do a lot of reducing.
[02:39.40]If I can get it down to like 20...
[02:43.88]Have I made that many?
[02:46.00]Somebody said, what's your official comment on the egg stream?
[02:59.83]I streamed myself eating, like, hard-boiled eggs or something.
[03:03.57]As an incentive of, like, dying in Team Fortress.
[03:05.73]I don't know, it was like nine years ago.
[03:15.82]Make a best noise to us.
[03:21.36]Do it again.
[03:22.14]No.
[03:30.80]Please hurry.
[03:31.50]Let me get some updates.
[03:33.14]Updates, updates, updates, updates, updates.
[03:34.66]You peaked on the egg stream.
[03:35.84]Well, that's weird considering I think there were like 40 people on that stream.
[03:41.45]interesting that uh I thought I had a little bit a little bit higher view numbers than that now okay so here's what we're gonna do well I didn't even update you okay so I'm going to say something that might sound a little uh there might be some shocked faces here but the nature of how many nominees have come in
[04:07.46]I'm not saying this yet.
[04:08.80]I have not said this yet, so don't quote me on this, but just like put it in brackets and then quote it.
[04:14.52]I might not do it on New Year's Eve.
[04:18.82]We might be one of those, like, January, like, 3rd- Well, there's a dead pixel on this monitor!
[04:24.44]I just got it!
[04:26.54]What?!
[04:30.64]There's a- I got a dead pixel right in front of me.
[04:34.94]It's just a green dot.
[04:36.10]Come on!
[04:38.32]Oh, that sucks.
[04:42.00]That actually sucks.
[04:45.48]Maybe, I mean, okay.
[04:47.86]Come on, really?
[04:51.24]I didn't see, I didn't see it here before.
[04:56.24]You mad about one pixel?
[04:58.82]Yeah, I mean, when you spend the money on one of these monitors...
[05:05.87]reset it sometimes dead pixels kind of just are there and then they they just kind of flicker out right that's annoying alright the monitor is uh I got a predator I don't know the company I actually don't even remember the company's name I don't know is it a Zeus asus I don't know I don't know what what who made this acer it's an acer predator
[05:34.13]And I turned it on, it was pretty good.
[05:37.93]But whatever, I won't complain about that right now.
[05:45.11]Asus, yeah, no, they don't, I don't know.
[05:48.73]So, alright, so I don't know, I'm not sure if I want to move it like a few days just to make sure we have everything good.
[05:52.96]I have not said that yet.
[05:54.54]I might just do double time here in the next few days to make sure that that actually happens.
[05:58.46]Because there's also Rumble too.
[06:00.88]So, we'll see if I get it on New Year's Eve.
[06:03.60]But don't be surprised if it's like two or three days into the new year.
[06:08.49]We'll see.
[06:08.97]I have not committed to that yet.
[06:10.23]I'm going to try.
[06:10.71]I'm not canceling it.
[06:13.47]No.
[06:13.91]No way.
[06:15.51]So, what we're doing today is something I've been talking about for a long time.
[06:18.83]It is a... Oh, let me turn my light on a bit.
[06:22.56]So this stream is gonna be a You Laugh, You Lose.
[06:24.32]I've never done it before.
[06:25.20]There's been a list of meme videos and there's a playlist that I'm about to watch.
[06:32.11]It's got like 200 videos on it or something.
[06:34.93]And it's just memes and funny shit and we'll see if it gets me.
[06:39.65]If I laugh, we have a few incentives.
[06:44.20]Next summer, try Doom.
[06:46.70]I think I just read that completely wrong.
[06:48.40]My microphone's in the wrong place and there's a dead pixel on my monitor.
[06:52.34]This is too much for me.
[06:53.25]I think I'm done.
[06:53.77]Okay, so...
[06:58.33]Eat an egg sandwich.
[06:59.13]No, no, no.
[06:59.73]I'm not doing like incentives where if I laugh three times, I have to do a headstand and drink a glass of milk.
[07:04.37]No.
[07:07.67]I am like the uncle on Christmas that doesn't buy presents for anybody.
[07:13.70]He just shows up with cash.
[07:16.16]Here you go.
[07:17.04]Here you go.
[07:17.76]And here you go.
[07:19.02]That's $50 for each of you.
[07:23.04]So here's what we're gonna do.
[07:26.24]I'm going to make a pool of money every time I laugh.
[07:30.04]And it has to be an audible laugh.
[07:31.80]It can't be... No, like smiling.
[07:34.46]You're the best uncle ever.
[07:38.10]Yeah, no smiling.
[07:40.44]No smirks.
[07:43.00]No like... You know what I'm talking about?
[07:47.52]None of that.
[07:48.04]It has to be like... What?
[07:52.55]That's what we're talking about.
[07:55.80]We could do... We could change these rows a little bit when we get closer.
[07:59.30]Because I get... I'm going to pause it.
[08:00.66]I get to pause it at least a few times.
[08:04.08]I don't think... No, belly laugh only.
[08:05.30]I don't think so.
[08:05.78]It doesn't have to be a belly laugh.
[08:08.36]It just has to be very clearly I have like... I've laughed.
[08:12.76]I will accept... Um... Like, if my mouth opens and a bunch of air comes out, and it's like... That counts.
[08:22.42]Face cam... Of course I'm gonna do face cam.
[08:27.22]So, but... After that, we're gonna watch a few baby sensory videos.
[08:33.14]Um, I have found some.
[08:35.42]I've got about, like, half dozen, I think, or so.
[08:37.62]They're all pretty long.
[08:40.32]And I don't know how this is gonna play out.
[08:41.80]They look fucking really weird.
[08:45.82]I am also considering, uh, activating what I would call hard mode.
[08:50.84]Uh, for myself.
[08:52.20]I'm gonna just kinda hang out for a little bit.
[08:55.99]And hard mode might activate.
[08:57.95]And, uh, it'll be hard to do this.
[09:03.34]I might activate hard mode.
[09:08.68]We'll see.
[09:10.00]I don't know if I'm going to activate hard mode.
[09:13.20]Difficulty!
[09:14.20]Difficulty!
[09:15.13]What the fuck?
[09:20.71]So, let's switch it over here.
[09:22.85]Let's see what's going on now.
[09:27.73]I have it ready.
[09:28.83]I know the title of the- and this is a playlist, so this is just gonna go.
[09:31.37]By the way, for every time that I laugh, for like the first- we'll go with the first maybe... 30 minutes?
[09:38.41]I don't have like a- really necessarily a plan.
[09:40.53]But, we're gonna have a pool of money.
[09:43.60]And every time I laugh, $100 is gonna get added to that pool.
[09:49.20]Once the pool has been filled, at the end of the stream,
[09:55.66]I'm going to decide what is going to happen with that money.
[10:02.91]$100 every time I laugh.
[10:09.65]I've never... Yes, I'm like copycat Andy, alright?
[10:13.21]I've never done this before.
[10:14.57]It seemed like fun.
[10:18.70]Yeah, this... Charity, there's... Yeah, it probably will... A majority of it will go to charity.
[10:28.26]I have a few things that I have in mind, a few places in mind.
[10:30.98]So we'll figure it out.
[10:32.18]But a hundred bucks gets added to that pool.
[10:37.98]So are you ready?
[10:39.72]Well, hold on.
[10:40.78]The better question is, am I ready?
[10:44.63]I don't know.
[10:47.69]We'll find out.
[10:48.37]And I know I might look like a little weird today because I have this thing here.
[10:52.83]I've got this light.
[10:55.12]You need to be able to see my face today.
[10:58.96]I don't care how shitty it looks.
[11:02.48]It's like a candle lit stream.
[11:03.88]Yeah.
[11:07.04]It's very warm.
[11:09.44]Can you see me well?
[11:10.95]You need to be able to see my face because if I go like... Then you need to be able to pick it up.
[11:18.65]Is the cam too small?
[11:19.57]I don't want the cam to be, because we're about to put the playlist on.
[11:27.75]I think there's 200 videos in this playlist.
[11:31.94]Well, I said charity pool, but we're just going to call it pool.
[11:35.74]Just for now.
[11:36.10]Pool.
[11:41.60]Pool.
[11:44.66]Okay.
[11:46.16]100 bucks if I... Alright, can I get it out of my system right now?
[11:52.32]Like, when does it start?
[11:55.20]I do look fucking evil.
[11:58.35]He's high.
[11:58.87]I have not activated hard mode.
[12:02.73]Hard mode is not activated.
[12:05.69]As soon as I click play, okay.
[12:07.11]Okay.
[12:13.10]What if I lose immediately?
[12:14.58]What happens?
[12:15.20]Oh, I had money.
[12:15.86]Okay.
[12:18.02]Can you make an incentive where if you laugh, you kiss the camera?
[12:25.99]That is so weird.
[12:27.07]That's so fucked up.
[12:31.05]Alright.
[12:32.52]That's the first incentive.
[12:33.72]If I laugh, I'll kiss the camera.
[12:35.76]You ready?
[12:37.56]Make sure you guys can... Can you guys hear this?
[12:40.58]After you take...
[12:41.62]Don't.
[12:42.04]Spoilers.
[12:43.98]It doesn't count yet.
[12:44.62]I haven't really started.
[12:47.66]Some of these might be loud.
[12:48.60]Just be aware of that.
[12:49.36]I don't know.
[12:50.61]Okay, here we go.
[13:03.46]You're wicked parasocial.
[13:04.48]What?
[13:05.42]I always tell people don't do that.
[13:06.76]Because I'm just a fucking weirdo that you don't know on the internet.
[13:09.45]You don't know me.
[13:10.09]You don't even like me in real life.
[13:11.19]I guarantee it.
[13:12.49]Alright, here we go.
[13:19.79]One.
[13:20.63]Two.
[13:20.99]Three.
[13:22.26]After you take away the bread, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayonnaise, what have you got?
[13:29.22]A fax machine.
[13:32.47]they say the the hammer can fix anything right my TV's broken yeah holy wow um there's some Scottish people that kind of say purple bugger purple bugger purple bugger
[13:58.70]Alright, I wasn't expecting Vince McMahon to show up.
[14:04.66]Let's put $100 in here.
[14:29.22]Oh no, it's kissed the camera!
[14:34.90]How do I do this without being weird?
[14:42.72]This is... I don't want to do this.
[14:48.10]I don't want to do this!
[14:53.67]Oh!
[14:54.13]No!
[14:55.57]No, I don't think so!
[14:56.55]This is weird, isn't it?
[15:00.67]Okay, how about this?
[15:02.07]There you go.
[15:02.51]I blew you a little kiss.
[15:03.45]There you go.
[15:04.03]Alright, I got it.
[15:05.31]I did it.
[15:07.25]I'm not doing something like that again.
[15:14.12]Oh, son of a bitch.
[15:15.80]What?
[15:16.62]It's me, Austin.
[15:17.68]It was me.
[15:21.19]Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab, Crab
[15:53.23]That was cute.
[15:54.07]Exterior like fish eggs.
[15:55.57]Interior like suicide wrist rags.
[15:57.99]I could exercise you.
[15:59.21]This could be your visit.
[16:00.45]Cheat on your man, homie.
[16:02.08]I tried to sneak through the door, man.
[16:03.82]Can't make it.
[16:04.44]Can't make it.
[16:04.86]The shit's stuck.
[16:05.86]Out of my way, son.
[16:07.16]Door's stuck.
[16:08.34]Door's stuck.
[16:10.00]Please.
[16:10.66]Classic.
[16:11.94]I'm not you.
[16:13.17]We're dead.
[16:14.77]You're a genuine dick sucker.
[16:23.34]I thought this was a baby sensory video, I was about to laugh.
[16:51.36]Have you seen Armand Kristoff?
[16:54.00]Don't worry.
[16:55.54]We'll get him.
[17:15.49]Can I help you?
[17:20.48]What is he doing over there?
[17:21.98]That was the closest I think it was, besides the Austin one.
[17:30.89]Mark.
[17:35.21]I can't believe how drunk you are.
[17:42.01]I am not drunk.
[17:43.99]Yes, you are.
[17:46.29]I am not fucking drunk.
[17:49.08]Can you tell the time?
[17:51.16]Yes.
[17:54.10]I am not fucking drunk.
[17:57.92]I mean, this is just interesting.
[17:59.56]This one's very interesting.
[18:27.45]I almost laughed at this because it was weird.
[18:31.75]Cover all 9,000 taste buds.
[18:35.29]Aerate it.
[18:36.45]Warm it up.
[18:38.23]Driving up that top note.
[18:41.16]That cream.
[18:42.24]Pure vanilla.
[18:44.36]Sweeteners.
[18:47.46]That's a 10.
[18:49.72]I've seen this video a million times.
[18:51.02]I love it.
[18:52.82]Not this one in particular, but...
[18:57.81]boys and free my soul I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
[19:05.45]I ain't never seen no mustard on that, but it might be good, though.
[19:07.85]My daddy know better.
[19:08.75]I'm out of here to him.
[19:11.70]Come on, mustard.
[19:12.86]Come on, man.
[19:13.78]Now, don't put no mustard on it.
[19:15.14]You need to put a little seed on that thing.
[19:17.66]What?
[19:18.28]Man, come on, now.
[19:19.10]Get that pimp off there.
[19:20.58]Come on.
[19:20.92]Somebody come get this, man.
[19:22.04]Come on, now.
[19:22.70]Come on.
[19:23.18]Get that pimp off.
[19:24.08]That's just too much dog on pimp.
[19:26.40]I don't really want to see this no more.
[19:28.14]Ah, what happened?
[19:29.02]Yeah!
[19:31.08]You good?
[19:32.84]You good?
[19:33.30]You good?
[19:33.60]You good?
[19:34.08]Loud.
[20:08.85]Twitter stinks.
[20:09.93]I'm leaving.
[20:11.31]That just scared the shit out of me.
[20:13.45]That was weird.
[20:16.07]We saw people in the streets ready to put 2018 in the rearview mirror and say hello to 2019.
[20:22.25]We also saw this dog with a banana.
[20:24.63]A festive atmosphere in the heart of downtown Orlando is what it's all about.
[20:31.38]On the skyline, would you like to try a new chicken tendie and french fry combo?
[20:34.14]Hell no.
[20:35.70]Can I get a chicken tendie combo, please?
[20:38.86]Bruh.
[20:40.30]What the fuck was that?
[20:41.50]That was so stupid!
[20:43.04]What the fuck was that?
[20:58.78]That was like just, just bizarre!
[21:01.08]Can I get a chicken tendie combo please?
[21:17.42]That was you working the drive-thru.
[21:21.37]That was, that was just weird.
[21:22.77]It was just like, why would somebody ever do something like that?
[21:26.23]Are you sitting in front of a fireplace?
[21:34.63]Alright, let me add it.
[21:37.41]What do they even say?
[21:38.81]You have the angel filter on.
[21:45.99]Okay.
[21:49.46]That's $100.
[21:56.70]I want to see this one again.
[21:58.84]Some of these I've seen.
[21:59.78]Some of these I've never seen before.
[22:02.30]This is...
[22:05.00]Hell no.
[22:05.62]Can I get a chicken tendie combo, please?
[22:13.88]I love that one.
[22:23.71]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[22:26.01]Alright.
[22:28.29]Again?
[22:28.71]Does that count?
[22:29.89]That shouldn't count twice.
[22:33.92]No, no, it doesn't count.
[22:34.84]We were paused.
[22:36.52]What the fuck?
[22:37.66]It counts?
[22:38.38]Should it actually count, though?
[22:40.98]Oh.
[22:41.90]Move the camera?
[22:42.56]Where should I move it?
[22:47.25]Either 200 or... Fine.
[22:49.07]Now it counts.
[22:49.51]Alright.
[22:49.79]Yeah, I can't... Alright.
[22:56.03]I'm usually... Here's the thing.
[22:57.81]I'm usually pretty immune to most memes...
[23:03.17]But sometimes they get me.
[23:06.17]Sometimes they work.
[23:08.59]We're getting a lot of community subs.
[23:09.55]What are you guys doing?
[23:12.24]Okay, here we go.
[23:13.28]Back to it.
[23:15.72]Holy fuck.

[28:05.47]I tell you right now, all the Skyrim and Oblivion memes don't do anything to me.
[28:09.11]Zero.
[28:09.39]Because I've only played those games with like Kermit the Frog fucking mods.
[28:14.37]And like Thomas the Tank Engine and shit and like huge monsters and stuff.
[28:18.35]It does nothing to me.
[28:20.15]Because that by comparison is like nothing.
[28:24.15]To like Kermit the Frog chasing you with a fucking battle axe.
[28:30.54]I've never played those games normally, ever.
[28:39.51]I found some wild glizzies.
[28:47.32]Hi, my name is Carla Shaw.
[28:50.46]You can stop at five or six stores or just one.

[36:24.49]It counts.
[36:41.71]I laughed at both of them in a row.
[36:48.25]The only reason why I laughed at the second one was because the captions were on the screen.
[36:54.72]What happened here?
[36:56.04]It was just so alarming.
[36:57.54]Is it Daffy?
[37:01.48]He's fucking dead.

[37:12.86]He has a gun.
[37:14.12]I don't know.
[37:25.83]Something about that is just... I don't understand the second one, but it was... Did you know we've... Oh, you want to fight?
[37:35.72]This is not going to make me laugh.
[37:37.06]I did it.
[37:37.82]Don't...
[38:12.97]I hear them.
[38:13.75]I heard something over there.
[38:14.91]I heard them.
[38:15.70]I wasn't worried for a minute.
[38:17.38]Oh, no.
[38:18.00]Oh, no.
[38:18.92]Please defuse the bomb, sir.
[38:20.32]The bomb is down.
[38:21.18]The bomb's at A. The bomb's ticking at A.
[38:31.77]That was close.
[38:32.95]Who wants some more?
[38:33.95]Get it, baby!
[38:34.87]Yes!
[38:35.95]Yes!

[38:44.01]Bombsite secured.
[38:45.21]Bombsite under control.
[38:46.49]Where's the bomb? Where's the bomb? Where's the bomb? Where's the bomb? Where's the bomb?
[38:54.94]Uh-oh.
[38:55.72]Uh, sir?
[38:56.78]The bomb?
[38:57.60]Time is running out.
[38:58.66]There's not much time left.
[38:59.64]That's not good.
[39:00.50]Oh, my God.
[39:30.86]I got a feeling.
[39:59.56]The title!
[40:00.52]What's this title, man?
[40:01.84]The title!
[40:07.65]It's Zoomer Humor.
[40:09.91]I can't help it.
[40:10.75]It's like I'm... Okay.
[40:12.79]Jeez.
[40:13.29]It's just... It's too much going on.
[40:16.31]Zoomer Humor.
[40:17.54]I don't know.
[40:17.96]You know what it is?
[40:18.90]It's the fact that there are just so many sound effects.
[40:23.08]And so... And it's so fast.
[40:24.22]Like that...
[40:27.20]It's just like your brain doesn't know what else to do besides laugh because there's no other emotion that makes any sense at all.
[40:33.66]Nothing else makes sense.
[40:37.13]It's just like all the different images.
[40:44.11]Okay, I feel like...
[40:47.42]When you close your eyes, right, when you're going to sleep, let me know if anybody else has this happen to them.
[40:51.92]When you close your eyes and you're sleeping and you're just about to hit that place where you're, alright, I've gone unconscious and I'm falling asleep.
[41:01.39]There's this moment where your mind just kind of goes wherever.
[41:06.85]It just races.
[41:08.67]you'll go to random places, you'll be sitting at a restaurant opposite side like Obama, just sitting there and having a conversation.
[41:16.35]All of a sudden you'll feel or hear like the wind will blow, the door will open and there is snow outside and I'm gonna go outside, there's snow out there.
[41:22.84]There's a hamster in the snow.
[41:25.10]Our minds do this weird thing right before falling asleep.
[41:28.84]That's what this is.
[41:30.46]And having it be in a conscious state and seeing it rather than kind of feeling it while you're sleeping
[41:38.10]It's just, I can't do it.
[41:40.84]It's too much.
[41:47.78]Okay.
[41:48.72]So that was by far the biggest one for sure.
[41:55.34]I can't imagine if this is on hard mode.
[42:04.24]Alright, let me update this.
[42:10.35]The fact that, like, somebody made this, like, specifically.
[42:14.07]And they titled it this weird title.
[42:18.63]Alright, you have to go back and do it again.
[42:26.19]Where are we?
[42:26.77]Okay, here.
[42:31.05]I'm gonna lose, I think it's gonna, I'm gonna fuck it up again.
[42:34.69]Yeah, it's just surreal, it's just so, everything is so odd.
[42:42.35]Okay, I'm fine.
[42:44.63]Okay, I got through it.
[43:13.61]That was cute.
[43:15.71]That was really cute.
[43:16.66]That wasn't even funny, it was cute.
[43:34.65]See, you motherfuckers are gonna think this is funny.
[43:37.41]I got the honey.
[43:39.25]You may got the honey, but I got the sugar.
[43:42.38]You may got those, but I got the creamy peanut butter.
[43:45.30]Awesome.
[43:45.70]Croissant.
[43:48.92]Nutella.
[43:51.40]Beans.
[43:53.02]Great.
[43:54.07]Mitsubishi.
[43:55.63]Materials.
[43:57.07]Let's see.
[43:57.69]Cream of mushrooms.
[43:59.71]Bro, she might have made beans, but you forgot about the...
[44:02.79]Macaroni and cheese, what do you want?
[44:06.73]Creamy and diet.
[44:10.29]Cheddar cheese.
[44:13.44]Well, you may have the cheddar cheese, but I've got... Nutritamine.
[44:38.37]This one's just scary.
[45:07.26]What are you eating?
[45:16.04]I miss my wife tails.
[45:18.54]I miss her a lot.
[45:19.80]I'll be back.

[51:57.48]I haven't seen this video in a long time.
[52:01.18]That's how I knew I was fucking screwed.
[52:05.46]It's always... Okay, I'm gonna try, I have to start it over.
[52:08.91]We got a thousand bucks in the pool right now.
[52:20.03]It's just this, this, this photo, just, ugh, whatever.
[52:23.30]You know, you, I don't have to say it again.
[52:24.78]I fail, let's go.
[52:25.54]I'm gonna get fucking locked here.
[52:58.10]I have to get over it.
[52:59.92]It's the, you've done a lot together.
[53:02.56]It's just, I can't, it's, fuck.
[53:09.93]This is bad.
[53:10.57]I, once I get stuck, I get stuck for a while.
[53:13.53]Okay.
[53:21.01]Okay.
[53:23.19]You're insane.
[53:23.95]You're going to get stunlocked here.
[53:25.21]I'm going to try.
[53:25.91]Okay.
[53:26.43]No.
[53:26.75]Why are you laughing?
[53:27.55]It's fucking crazy.
[53:29.00]It's so stupid.
[53:57.21]Fuck!
[53:58.68]I can't!
[54:04.92]No!
[54:05.48]I... If all the videos... I have to... I need to take a minute.
[54:16.85]I can't... You can't skip it.
[54:17.99]That's not how this works.
[54:23.93]We're at $1,200 now.
[54:26.09]I'm gonna get through this one.
[54:27.11]I'm gonna get through it.
[54:27.77]I just have to hide.
[54:28.63]Everybody relax.
[54:39.09]It's the music, too.
[54:40.47]The music is so... And this photo in the very beginning.
[55:27.06]I'm sorry.
[55:38.40]Okay.
[55:40.42]Skip it for 500?
[55:42.26]No, I can get it.
[55:43.18]I swear to God, I can get it.
[55:47.66]It's a... Oh, remember this?
[55:49.57]Like, we just remembered it.
[55:51.53]You don't make us remember this again.
[55:52.89]It's horrible.
[55:53.85]I don't want to remember this.
[55:54.87]I don't ever want to think of this again.
[55:57.67]Alright, last try and then I'm skipping it for 100 bucks.
[56:02.68]I'm gonna get through it this time.
[56:03.66]I've seen it enough time.
[56:07.66]God damn it.
[56:11.76]I remember this video too and I have just been so long.
[56:16.96]Okay.
[56:18.52]This is it.
[56:19.02]This is the one.
[57:20.13]Get it off, turn it off, turn it off.
[57:28.83]I've done it too many times.
[57:31.53]Oh my God, my head hurts.
[57:33.49]I'm good.

[59:31.43]So Frank.
[59:32.55]Inspired by that same French excellence.
[59:37.17]It's fermented in the bottle and like the best French champagne, it's vintage dated.

[60:38.57]Oh, this is a class.
[60:39.23]I love this video.
[60:40.07]I'm not even going to laugh at this.
[60:41.51]This video is just a good video.
[60:42.79]Let me move some of this stuff out of the way.
[60:48.05]This is a great video.

[63:12.72]That just sucks.
[63:13.82]What happened?
[63:24.27]I'm staying up extra late tonight to see a test train pull into Brighton Station.
[63:28.73]One of my favorite locomotives might be on it, so we'll just have to wait and see.
[63:32.67]It's 73962!
[63:33.99]Oh, it's it!
[63:34.25]It's it!
[63:41.99]Oh, quick, I've gotta get around.
[63:43.27]I've gotta get around to see it.
[63:45.41]This is beautiful 73962.
[63:48.45]Dick my butt.
[63:51.25]What?
[63:51.65]Beautiful locomotive shears.
[63:54.08]Check out all the gear in there.
[63:58.10]That's not real.
[64:00.74]Another marvelous loco.
[64:03.84]I'm glad I stayed up late for this.
[64:05.56]This is a treat.
[64:11.15]That's a real train?
[64:12.11]Oh!

[66:06.84]Can you imagine like somebody sitting behind Donkey Kong just yelling all this shit to him?
[66:17.77]You need to stay when they go up and they do the gliding.
[66:20.41]Holy shit.
[66:21.13]I'm sweating my ass off.
[66:24.38]It's always cars, I know.
[66:26.06]Something about vehicles, just cars.
[66:31.94]I don't know why.
[66:32.66]They're just so... Something about it just does it to me.
[66:35.50]I don't get it.
[66:36.14]We're at 1400.
[66:41.84]It's alright.
[66:44.80]I don't... It's just like the way he's turning and the car is bump... You don't even go... That doesn't even happen to you in Mario Kart.
[66:53.12]Okay.
[66:54.12]You're admitting it.
[66:54.80]I'm just finding out what I think is... Is it just big, bulky machines that we just drive around?
[67:01.06]It's so weird that we do this in the first place.
[67:04.66]Don't you guys think it's just bizarre that we drive around in cars anyways?
[67:07.58]Like, it's such a weird object.
[67:09.66]We have this machine that we all just sit in and it just goes fast.
[67:13.63]It's just like a... What a fucking weird device.
[67:21.27]Okay.
[67:22.13]Let's update it.
[67:24.79]And, alright, I'm going to try this one again.
[67:26.97]He's got the notepad to... I'm going to try this one more time.
[67:37.63]I think I can get through it.
[67:38.39]It was just this part here when he's yelling at him to stay on the road because they're flying.
[67:42.09]Here we go.
[67:44.71]Do you do hard mode?
[67:47.61]Maybe.
[67:48.21]Let's go.
[67:48.49]3, 2, 1.
[67:51.87]You didn't laugh at the train.
[67:54.91]That was more unusual to me than funny.
[67:58.51]Go.
[67:59.53]3, 2, 1, go.
[68:03.18]Fast, sharp right.
[68:04.86]Fast, sharp right.
[68:05.98]Sharp right.
[68:06.70]Sharp right.
[68:07.41]Listen.
[68:07.63]Listen.
[68:08.89]shut up
[68:48.08]that was rough granny what are you doing I'm having a cookie
[69:10.66]Granny, those cookies aren't for you.
[69:12.74]What do you mean?
[69:13.74]They're for everybody, but only for you?
[69:16.32]Granny, they're dog treats.
[69:18.31]No!
[69:18.63]No!
[69:21.39]Oh, that was close.
[69:22.55]Just her daily... Squish that cat.
[69:24.79]All you need to know is to squish that cat.
[69:26.87]And you just gently squish them.
[69:28.23]That's not comfortable for the cat, or that safe, to be honest with you.
[69:31.59]You can just throw a towel on the cat again.
[69:32.95]Squish her with a towel.
[69:33.83]What you can do is scoop her up, a little football carry, just like that.
[69:36.99]Butt in your hand, and just squish her tight to your body.
[69:39.74]Just squish them really tight to your body.
[69:41.60]You don't even have to worry about hurting a cat.
[69:43.22]You know, just squish them against your body.
[69:44.82]And there we go.
[69:45.42]We just made friends with this wonderful little cat.
[69:47.40]What?
[69:47.52]Look at that face.
[69:48.46]Look at that face.
[69:49.28]Squishing is your best friend when you're dealing with a cat.
[69:51.14]Squish?
[69:51.44]You basically just lean forward, squish them nice and tight.
[69:54.20]And again, I'm just squishing them into myself.
[69:56.55]We always squish that cat.
[69:58.85]I'm just confused by that one.
[70:00.83]Squish?
[70:05.53]And two.
[70:21.37]I sweat you can't go in.
[70:53.41]Why do I feel like this is an edited video from like four different scenes of this movie, but it's not?
[71:12.71]Please cut the re- The end.
[71:15.21]The scream at the end.
[71:18.85]I've seen so many of those breathing videos, but it doesn't matter.
[71:43.78]I think I just missed one.
[71:50.86]Oh.
[71:51.04]How much longer?
[71:54.23]I don't know.
[71:56.07]I don't want to look.
[72:04.05]Macho Man Randy Savage had some classic breathing videos too.
[72:08.61]Alright, let me add it.
[72:09.17]I feel like I don't have to watch that one again because I got to the very end and I laughed after the video ended.
[72:18.26]30k viewers, what's up?
[72:20.32]Welcome to the stream.
[72:20.92]This is a You Laugh, You Lose slash Baby Sensory stream.
[72:25.48]This is fun.
[72:27.46]What's going on?
[72:27.98]What's up, everybody?
[72:30.34]Okay, I didn't laugh at this one.
[72:31.96]Let's start this one over.
[72:34.08]What is baby sensory?
[72:35.28]I might go hard mode for that one.
[72:37.54]We'll find out.
[72:38.04]Please cut the ringing.
[72:46.95]It sounds kind of like a... I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it.
[73:01.60]Jesus!
[73:02.46]Even the babies are one of the most dangerous animals in the world, so I built this cage to keep them secure so there's no possible- Oh my god!
[73:09.22]Bro, you know what I'm saying?
[73:16.47]If I miss this joke, I'm lowkey.
[73:18.43]If I miss this joke, I'm gay as hell.
[73:20.95]I'm gay as hell if I miss this joke.
[73:27.32]Yo, Baba, how's the food tasting?
[73:34.83]Yo, Baba, how's the food tasting?
[73:37.61]Oh, this stuff is buzzing.
[73:40.43]Respectfully.
[73:42.08]No kizzy.
[73:43.38]Oh, what about you, Abuji?
[73:46.84]Cheers!
[73:54.96]Yo.
[74:01.90]I knew he was gonna say it too.
[74:03.80]That's the worst part.
[74:04.78]It just, he screamed it.
[74:07.67]I don't, whatever.
[74:08.33]I have Zoomer humor.
[74:09.15]I don't care.
[74:10.39]I don't give a shit anymore.
[74:11.59]Whatever.
[74:14.65]Make a well-crafted joke.
[74:17.37]No, I don't think it's funny.
[74:18.49]I don't care.
[74:19.01]You give like a whole story of something funny that happened.
[74:21.41]Get an old guy to say sheesh on camera and I'm gone.
[74:27.11]It's just the first part.
[74:28.73]The first part of the Zoomer humor is funny.
[74:32.23]I think they're quick.
[74:34.07]That's something I think Zoomers don't get a lot of credit for.
[74:35.94]Zoomers are quick, right?
[74:38.82]Now, a lot of Zoomer humor just, I think, falls.
[74:40.80]It just goes right off my head.
[74:42.38]But man, they're quick.
[74:44.18]They're quick.
[74:46.30]And the best part about Zoomer humor is because it's so quick, even if it sucks, it's over in three seconds.
[74:54.70]If I don't like a boomer or like older person's joke or something, I might have to sit there for four minutes while they tell me.
[75:03.72]Shit's over in two seconds if you're a Zoomer.
[75:08.36]Alright, I just want to see it again because I like it.
[75:10.20]We're getting so many subs, too.
[75:11.48]This is ridiculous.
[75:12.38]Thanks, everybody.
[75:13.64]25 from... Well, okay.
[75:17.47]I think it's time to do hard mode.
[75:19.43]Unionize your workplace.
[75:20.49]Thanks for 25 community subs.
[75:22.07]And then we had 10 from David Shower.
[75:25.13]Thank you.
[75:25.51]Okay.
[75:27.38]I just want to see it again.
[75:29.54]Oh, Baba, how's the food tasting?
[75:31.90]Oh, this stuff is buzzing.
[75:34.21]You can tell he's waiting his turn to do the joke.
[75:36.37]No.
[75:37.27]It gets me too.
[75:37.83]What about you, Abuji?
[75:41.15]Cheers!
[76:03.65]You know why he's called Colonel Sanders?
[76:05.03]No, why?
[76:05.55]Oh, because he is... We'll catch you.
[76:11.47]We'll put the president of the fucking United States, guy.
[76:15.13]Hello, America.
[76:37.24]Hot wizards in your area!
[76:39.68]I don't want love!
[76:41.38]I just want sex!
[76:43.12]See my worm!
[76:44.81]Click here!
[76:46.19]Bibbity-bobbity-bring that sweet ass over to my tower, baby!
[76:51.29]What?
[76:58.30]Hi.
[76:59.06]The easy way to say yee is to say
[77:10.07]Holdin' a yogurt?
[77:10.71]Fuck.
[77:13.31]What the fuck?
[77:26.28]So, what I'm looking for for you to do is I'm looking for you to take care of me.
[77:31.20]Take good care of me.
[77:33.75]I literally, all I can see is colors.
[77:40.17]What the fuck?
[77:40.57]This guy's fucking crazy.
[77:41.61]Who is this guy?
[77:42.31]This guy's fucked up.
[77:44.07]Heart of Darkness is about a young boy named Andy.
[77:47.03]I'm skipping it.
[77:48.17]We don't watch those videos.
[78:14.37]You forgot to add 100?
[78:15.07]Oh, shit.
[78:15.51]I'll get it.
[78:20.12]An embarrassing video.
[78:23.54]Cheater.
[78:27.50]Well, I don't think I'm going to... Alright, here we go.
[78:28.80]Listen to me.
[78:29.70]I don't think I'm going to laugh at my own streams.
[78:33.42]If I'm honest.
[78:34.86]Because, like, I was there.
[78:40.24]No rules, Andy.
[78:40.99]Andy?
[78:44.73]400 subs?
[78:45.31]What?
[78:46.39]Oh, you just made that up, Art.
[78:49.61]Well, it's because they're not funny.
[78:57.24]No, you can have that opinion.
[78:58.96]If you don't think I'm funny, then that's fine.
[79:00.68]I'm not going to tell you you're wrong.
[79:01.56]I'm going to be sad for a minute, and then curse you out when I'm in the shower.
[79:08.56]These are my red flags for women.
[79:12.24]If she stabbed me more than twice.
[79:14.49]If she has a concerning amount of ex-husbands who died on their honeymoon, like four or more.
[79:19.85]If goes to the Gazarian, asks me to choose the form of the destructor, and then when my childhood crushes, walks through New York City at 300 feet tall and steps on a church.
[79:27.65]I mean, it's not the height.
[79:30.26]It's not the height.
[79:30.94]I like the climb.
[79:31.74]But, like, she stepped on a church.
[79:33.98]I mean, any building, really.

[86:12.38]oh my god that was just cool I love perpetrators now this just in police officers in Lancaster Pennsylvania I've seen this one people to be on the lookout for a man who robbed a store and I think yeah I think we just classic we do have his description can we take that let's take his description
[86:46.93]It's a classic, but it's not going to get me.
[86:48.47]Okay.
[86:49.17]This is the guy they wanted people in Pennsylvania to be out on the lookout for.
[86:54.12]He's got a nose and some hair that goes like that.
[86:58.48]This is actually real.
[86:59.40]It can't be.
[86:59.90]He's wearing a hat at the time of this particular crime.
[87:04.40]He's got kind of a chin that comes down to almost a point.
[87:07.98]It's real.
[87:09.86]Stands about 5 feet 4 inches tall.
[87:12.91]There it is.
[87:14.07]Get a good look for yourself.
[87:15.74]Oh, and now I'm getting word that police actually caught this guy, thanks to the sketch, no doubt.
[87:20.88]So, here's a picture of the real guy next to the sketch that led to his arrest.
[87:25.70]Where's the pointy chin?
[87:26.75]It's uncanny, Lisa.
[87:30.59]The guy on the left is now charged with two counts of theft, is being held in the Lancaster jail.
[87:37.75]And I say give that sketch artist a raise.
[87:40.84]This would be so funny, except it's a real sketch.
[87:45.23]That was actually the sketch the police sent out to the good folks in Lancaster.
[87:50.44]And, hey, to their credit, they came through.
[87:54.36]I'm trying to minus the hat.
[87:56.94]Okay, I'm good.
[87:57.88]I'm safe.
[87:58.46]Fastest hot dog shooter.
[87:59.52]Oh, shit.
[88:00.96]In the Northwest, I've never seen nobody be able to do this.
[88:04.32]I can do it quick.
[88:05.60]Okay?
[88:07.88]I'm just saying.
[88:09.54]Okay.
[88:16.49]We can go viral with this one.
[88:24.54]I've seen this video about two or three hundred times in the last six months.
[88:27.20]It's not going to get me, but it's my favorite.
[88:28.70]One of my favorite videos ever.
[88:31.12]I'm not going to reenact this.
[88:32.18]I'll die.
[88:38.90]Fastest hot dog shooter.
[88:48.09]Slimer it is.
[88:48.89]Did we already see this one?
[88:51.99]What?
[89:16.42]Oh, it's just he just walks by.
[89:24.19]This is bromine.

[90:02.90]I don't understand.
[90:05.88]What?
[90:09.47]What?
[90:18.76]He turned it on- He turned- Is it upside down?
[90:22.02]It's not a filter.
[90:25.08]I think he's up- I think he's upside down in this photo.
[90:31.92]Jesus.
[90:32.64]God damn it.
[90:33.36]Alright.
[90:33.92]That was- This is so stupid.
[90:37.65]RTX on.
[90:39.39]I think he's hanging upside down.
[90:41.79]Like he's upside down and like took a wicked fucked up upside down photo.
[90:47.37]Is that 18?
[90:48.27]Did I do it twice?
[90:54.01]It's because he's flexing.
[91:04.02]Yeah, that's 18.
[91:04.72]Alright, we'll go back.
[91:06.70]This one was crazy, too.
[91:07.80]Duke, do you want the ball?
[91:09.07]Hey.

[91:29.28]I'm doing it one more time.
[91:30.40]Hey.
[91:33.54]Have a good night.
[91:34.83]Okay.
[91:35.47]I'm over it.
[91:36.29]Gabby just can't wait to go.
[91:39.31]I've seen this a million times.
[91:41.09]Look at this dog walk.
[91:43.21]Whoa, what speed on that dog walk.
[91:45.47]Redirects a little bit.
[91:46.39]Make sure they get that.
[91:47.35]Push, push, push.
[91:48.96]Into that tunnel.
[91:50.22]Nice job.
[91:51.46]Get to the backside of this jump.
[91:53.66]Andrea, hang in there.
[91:55.38]Maybe she might have got lost for a quick second.
[91:58.44]Where's my lip balm?
[91:59.82]Okay.
[92:25.07]Oh Jesus What the hell is going on
[93:05.77]Why is it two?
[93:06.29]It's two people.
[93:15.86]Oh, it's the dog.
[93:17.06]Okay, they swapped out the dog.
[93:18.64]That's so weird.
[93:20.60]He's not gonna piss, is he?
[93:51.99]I think I'm okay.
[93:55.77]I think I'm alright.
[93:56.73]I think I'm going to be okay.
[93:57.81]Cute.
[94:17.21]Let's-a go!
[94:46.55]That was... Could any human do that?
[94:52.73]Like, if somebody practiced that enough, would it even be possible to do even the first part of that?
[95:01.04]It's a lucky thing I had my pieces.
[95:03.76]Your pieces?
[95:04.68]My guns.
[95:05.28]Oh.
[95:06.28]Anyway, I started blasting.
[95:09.04]I don't see so good, so I missed.
[95:10.48]Then they ran away.
[95:11.64]I ran after them.
[95:12.56]Okay.
[95:12.94]Bang!
[95:13.26]Tried to shoot them in the back.
[95:14.34]But I don't want so good either.
[95:16.82]I don't play video games, so I don't know what that's a reference to.
[95:52.03]I've seen it, but it's good.
[96:16.82]Siri, take a note.
[96:18.48]No, no, what's the note?
[96:20.65]Inside of a cave.
[96:23.67]Sharing two sticks with a guy.
[96:25.54]Some homeless guy.
[96:27.82]Threw up in his mouth.
[96:30.16]Mickey Mouse comes in.
[96:32.90]And drains all my battery from my iPod.
[96:39.82]I kiss him.
[96:43.19]I knew it was coming.
[96:44.37]Drains all my battery from my iPod.
[96:52.90]Oh, I'm so weird.
[96:54.70]I swear to God, I'm not high right now.
[96:56.44]I thought I was blocking the face cam.
[97:01.04]I actually thought I was blocking this face cam.
[97:02.92]I was like, oh shit, I gotta get out of the way.
[97:04.50]There's another face cam.
[97:07.32]I swear to God, I'm not in hard mode.
[97:11.10]What the fuck?
[97:14.66]That was really good.
[97:16.98]Okay.
[97:18.38]Let me take some inventory here.
[97:20.08]Let me see where we're at.
[97:21.28]Because I need to know how much further we got.
[97:23.46]And I gotta pee.
[97:24.82]And I gotta... Let's see.
[97:27.22]1900 bucks?
[97:28.20]Is in the pool?
[97:30.02]Let me see.
[97:30.34]I don't want to spoil anything.
[97:32.98]Alright.
[97:33.74]We are getting close.
[97:36.30]We're getting close.
[97:37.84]I'm gonna go pee.
[97:39.40]I'll be right back.
[97:40.46]We've got about 50 or 60 more videos.
[97:45.08]Until we get to the baby sensory shit.
[97:48.41]Which... I have no idea how that's going to go.
[97:52.21]I have no idea.
[97:58.01]And by the way... Well, I'm not going to say this yet because I'm not done.
[98:01.21]I'm not... I could watch another compilation.
[98:07.61]I'm into that.
[98:08.27]This is fun.
[98:09.01]This actually is fun to do.
[98:10.29]I'm having a great time.
[98:11.81]I'll be right back.
[98:12.47]Just going to go pee.
[98:13.88]And we'll keep going.
[98:15.52]See you guys in a minute.
[100:28.24]Thanks for watching!
[103:04.99]Hello!
[103:06.37]I've returned.
[103:06.87]I found my lip balm, thank God.
[103:09.69]Alright, let's keep going.
[103:16.93]We got about 60 videos left in this playlist and then we're gonna move to the baby sensory.
[103:25.09]It is Burt's Bees.
[103:25.81]It is.
[103:33.21]Why did I say hello like that?
[103:35.43]I don't know.
[103:37.89]This is a lot of fun, though.
[103:39.27]I always kind of put off doing this and didn't do it for a long time.
[103:42.13]Because I was like, I don't even know how to do that or where to start or how would I even, do I even really care?
[103:47.95]It's fun.
[103:54.45]I'm not going to do this every single stream.
[103:58.48]Did I find my vape?
[104:03.30]Normie?
[104:05.08]What do you mean?
[104:06.10]I'm not a normie.
[104:08.37]Alright, let's go.
[104:14.05]Be able to see.
[104:14.83]There we go.
[104:16.31]Okay.
[104:16.41]Okay.
[104:21.71]Let us continue.
[104:24.65]This needs to be like over here or something.
[104:29.37]Let me brighten this up.
[104:30.57]It looks like I'm sitting in front of a campfire.
[104:44.72]Better?
[104:46.06]Oh, that looks worse.
[104:54.00]Look at how much more handsome I look when it's up here.
[104:58.44]Lighting just matters so much.
[105:02.36]Look at this.
[105:03.77]This is with a light directly in my face.
[105:06.69]Look at that.
[105:08.19]Look at the difference.
[105:10.05]It's just so much better.
[105:12.27]Down here, that's why.
[105:13.39]It's because I have a big brow bone.
[105:14.75]Can I make it stay up here?
[105:18.36]It actually might stay up here.
[105:22.35]Dude.
[105:23.49]Look at that.
[105:25.41]I have like a real light in my face now.
[105:33.60]Okay.
[105:34.08]I just can't move that much.
[105:36.64]Actually, that's dangerous for it to be up there.
[105:40.34]Okay.
[105:40.48]Alright, let's go.
[105:43.16]Back to it.
[105:44.38]Did I scam?
[105:45.72]Is it 2,000?
[105:45.94]He zoinked.
[105:46.34]He zoinked.
[105:56.42]Not yet.
[106:01.00]Is it 19?
[106:01.54]Okay.
[106:01.88]I'm making sure I didn't scam.
[106:04.46]Here we go.
[106:06.04]I am ready.
[106:14.77]Can you see it?
[106:17.39]Okay.
[106:17.71]Here we go.
[106:21.41]Volume back up.
[106:25.64]Let's go.
[106:31.21]I'd like to solve.
[106:32.35]Well, you know, if you solve, there's a $7,000 jackpot.
[106:34.97]Go ahead.
[106:35.50]Shaggy and Scooby-Doo.
[106:36.64]Whoa!

[106:49.44]I have just one thing to say to you.
[107:04.47]Okay, so my GoPro setup isn't perfect yet, and I'm glad you guys are getting a kick out of it, but I really want it to be better.
[107:12.26]This video exemplifies why I need to work on this so much.
[107:17.31]It's really hard to keep that long, stiff, straight pole all the way out there that you need for the 360 cam to work right.
[107:27.16]He's got a lawnmower.
[107:28.06]There's like a little kid right there.
[107:54.55]Just scary.

[114:10.31]Oh, hey.
[114:13.03]Would you like one?
[114:14.11]Yeah.
[114:15.53]Thanks, Jerome.
[114:19.11]So weird.
[114:19.87]I can't deal with this anymore.
[114:26.95]This is...
[114:30.53]This is just perfect.
[114:31.41]I'm so pale.
[114:32.55]I look like a fucking... Look at how weird I look.
[114:38.83]Oh, my God.
[114:42.37]I gotta show Jerma this.
[114:44.38]Here.
[114:45.70]Whoa, shit.
[114:46.70]Oh, shit.
[115:18.09]I've never seen this!
[115:22.95]What?
[115:24.53]I just did not expect that at all.
[115:34.14]You know why this is so surprising to me?
[115:37.02]I've never seen Rocky 2.
[115:39.90]I just know that Rocky's a guy and he wears like pajamas and works out and then fights people.
[115:45.26]I've only seen like an hour of Rocky total.
[115:51.39]Okay.
[116:10.49]Gordon Freeman, for someone who proclaims to be a doctor, you should know that not every pee-pee time is a poo-poo time.
[116:24.14]But every pee-pee, poo, every, fuck, every poo-poo time is a pee-pee time.
[116:38.23]Hey Brad, I bet you can't laugh without smiling.
[116:41.43]What are you talking about?
[116:47.36]Oh, seriously Brad, it's not even that hard, watch.
[116:50.32]Oh!
[117:13.55]This is freaking me out.
[117:14.67]That was freaking me out.
[117:16.93]Loud.
[117:37.64]Day 23 in the chamber.
[117:38.98]They ain't found me yet, but when they do they're gonna be surprised It's me
[118:03.93]And what a game here as Johnson kicks towards the goal.
[118:06.23]And oh my god, Singh makes a fantastic save.
[118:09.06]But I believe he hit his nuts on the goal post.
[118:11.72]He is down.
[118:12.78]Let us have a closer look at instant replay.
[118:15.58]Not only just self-sacrifice on this play, but sacrificing future generations as well.
[118:20.62]Obviously going all out for his team.
[118:22.63]Saving the ball right here, but also losing two on the play.
[118:26.05]Putting his balls on the line.
[118:27.95]Let us have a moment of silence for this man's fallen brothers.
[118:31.05]As you see right here, he got the ball and so did...
[118:40.45]It's the zoomed in close up.
[118:45.47]He hit that hard.
[118:47.21]You can see his whole body like jiggles.
[118:50.92]Hold on.
[118:51.38]I've never seen some of these videos before.
[118:52.84]Jeez.
[118:53.06]Just look at this.
[119:04.72]It's, okay, it's the fact that it's just, it's not necessarily the commentary, it's just the, oh my god, wow, that would be so awful.
[119:13.10]Okay.
[119:14.58]What do we add?
[119:18.50]Is it 22 or 23?
[119:19.20]Alright, I actually gotta relax.
[119:26.02]Because this still is in place in Baby Sensory, and I don't think I'm gonna be able to handle, I can't handle Baby Sensory.
[119:31.64]I don't think I'll be able to handle it.
[119:34.14]Let's go.
[119:36.66]got to the ball and so did yoshi it's yoshi oh yoshi you are exactly what I was looking for
[120:05.17]Padre Satania Spiritus, get the fuck out of here, please.
[120:09.01]Uh-huh.
[120:09.37]Uh-huh.

[121:04.84]Wait, wait, wait.
[121:05.32]I got-
[121:07.75]Aw, look at them.
[121:08.66]They're having so much fun.
[121:40.00]Alright, here's what's happening here.
[121:42.23]They both want the other one to chase them.
[121:46.33]So when they're realizing that they're getting stuck in a math loop of their AI won't do it.
[121:55.84]They keep resetting.
[121:56.86]Like, why have you not chased me yet?
[122:06.72]Why are you not chasing me?
[122:12.73]That was fun.
[122:13.43]That was cute.

[124:05.88]The protocol's not banished in Origin.
[124:08.71]It's sturdier than I expected.
[124:11.63]I don't play Halo.
[124:18.25]I don't get it.
[124:22.18]Is it Cortana?
[124:28.70]No problem.

[125:38.11]It's coming.
[125:39.75]I love this video.
[125:43.91]Look at how pissed this cat gets.
[125:45.49]This cat is so angry that the dog farted.
[125:52.74]God.
[125:56.32]The end of that ad went on a very long time.
[126:01.24]Why do you laugh at this?
[126:02.58]Laughed at nothing?
[126:05.84]Because I know I'm going to laugh at this video.
[126:08.25]And the Thanos one was, holy shit, it was a miracle I was able to hold through that one.
[126:11.75]And then, oh my god, here comes one of my favorite funny cat hits the dog for farting videos?
[126:16.13]Nope.
[126:43.45]okay okay I got it 24. it's fake I just it's still funny no no more thanos
[127:27.35]That's so annoying.
[127:29.55]What a bunch of fucking assholes.
[127:31.27]What a bunch of dicks.
[127:35.20]This is the last video in this playlist.
[127:39.62]Okay, it wouldn't be funny to me if it was anywhere else, but he's at the airport.
[127:43.84]He has to show his ID.
[127:45.40]And the fact that they're very far away, that's the only reason why it was funny.
[127:50.05]If they were anywhere else.
[127:53.59]We are at $2,500. $2,500.
[127:58.34]This playlist is over.
[128:02.48]That does not mean that this is over.
[128:05.14]Coming up next is hard mode and baby sensory videos.
[128:09.07]And after that, we might actually do a few more.
[128:12.23]Just compilations.
[128:13.91]Maybe some of the mods can... I don't want to say this because I don't want a fucking five trillion people to hit up the mods.
[128:21.74]But maybe another compilation or so.
[128:25.14]Maybe one or two more.
[128:29.17]What's the pool for?
[128:30.33]So, at the end of this stream, I'm going to divvy this up, and we're going to give it to charity.
[128:35.03]So, I have a charity in mind that I might just give the whole thing to.
[128:38.86]We'll find out.
[128:39.22]Well, not a charity, necessarily, but an organization, so.
[128:44.58]This is fun.
[128:45.58]2,500 so far.
[128:46.08]Alright, let me, let's watch this last one and see if it's going to work.
[129:01.02]Okay, we're good.
[129:04.29]Tell what the pool is for in your title?
[129:07.99]Uh, okay, yeah.
[129:09.01]I'll update the title.
[129:11.23]Because now we're... Nice lighting?
[129:17.68]That wasn't in the playlist, this was just autoplay.
[129:20.22]What?
[129:20.68]Are you serious?
[129:24.51]Okay.
[129:24.61]Okay.
[129:31.71]Give me one second.
[129:32.23]Let me... Let me just... Instead of putting in the title, it's probably easier to do this.
[129:41.17]I'll make it a little smaller, too, so it's not... Okay.
[129:48.71]Getting a lot of community subs, too.
[129:51.58]Thank you Kiki Lime Pie for the 10.
[129:54.80]Thank you OiPMC for the 10.
[129:56.64]Vessel for the 5.
[129:57.60]And then Saran Ocean for the 25.
[130:00.90]I don't know if I can handle this.
[130:05.00]This is going to be really weird.
[130:07.47]I was going to have a notepad open where I'd write my feelings down, but I think the you laugh, you lose shit still is fine.
[130:14.15]So let me get that on.
[130:15.13]Let's get the first one on here.
[130:24.32]So this one is... Oh, God.
[130:28.50]This is still You Laugh, You Lose, by the way.
[130:31.60]I just found these on YouTube.
[130:33.00]I don't know how they are.
[130:34.24]I don't know anything really about them.
[130:36.90]I have no idea.
[130:38.54]Absolutely no clue.
[130:46.00]Here comes a baby early learning sensory video.
[130:53.51]Three, two, one.
[130:58.40]Hello, baby.
[131:04.76]Circle.
[131:15.02]Okay.
[131:20.77]It's like breathing.
[131:29.20]just thinking about the fact that I'm doing this right now I'm actually watching these and it's this is scary it's kind of scary for adults so what this supposed to be high contrast is a clockwork orange
[132:09.65]I'm about to veto this.
[132:12.75]All gone.
[132:13.49]I think I have to veto this whole thing.
[132:20.15]Fucking cloud music in the background.
[132:30.17]What is it?
[132:31.87]What is it?
[132:32.93]Circle!
[132:33.74]What is it?
[132:34.66]It's a circle!
[132:35.22]It's a circle!
[132:41.53]Okay, um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna just go ahead and say this.
[132:47.64]Um, feed your babies a well-balanced diet, please.
[132:52.10]And, like, you have, like, objects in your house, like, keys and stuff.
[132:56.04]You can play, like, peekaboo.
[132:57.24]I don't know if I want, I don't know if I'd want a baby to sit down.
[133:00.50]This is 22 minutes.
[133:01.78]I don't think I want a baby to sit down and, like, get, see this.
[133:05.38]I want to, like, draw this in a notebook and be like, that's a, look, that's a circle.
[133:10.23]I feel like if you have this on autoplay... Do it on x2 speed.
[133:16.49]I don't know, maybe there's a bunch of science about it.
[133:19.64]That, like, this is, like, developed, like, it's... Okay, you know, like, um, when adults play Brain Age for the DS?
[133:25.88]Maybe that, maybe this is literally just Brain Age for an infant.
[133:30.00]I have no idea.
[133:36.93]and down up and down up and down and up okay in and out in and out in and out and in switch switch switch switch switch switch switch is for babies it's it is I'm getting scared other way
[134:22.89]I have to put it like a warning here because it's gonna be um, this is x2
[134:33.54]But in the meantime, if there's any more You Laugh, You Lose compilations, I'd love to watch them.
[134:39.22]Maybe we can get them vetted quickly or something.
[134:41.68]But I ain't watching.
[134:43.30]I'm done after this.
[134:43.94]This is fucking what a shit idea.
[134:45.55]This is one of the worst ideas I've ever had.
[134:48.99]Ever.
[134:49.23]One of the worst ideas I've ever had.
[134:50.91]So I'm going to put a warning here first.
[135:05.47]Okay, here we go.
[135:08.03]I'm not doing all 22 minutes.
[135:09.25]We're going to another You Laugh, You Lose.
[135:11.85]Okay, here we go.
[135:30.23]That was crazy.
[135:46.44]Oh, it's because... I forgot it was in times two speed.
[135:57.04]I forgot it was in times two speed, man.
[135:58.66]I thought, like, what the fuck is... What is this alien video we're watching?
[136:07.49]I was like, why is it like this?
[136:09.29]I forgot it was times two.
[136:17.86]But yeah, if a mod has another good compilation, just even one you find.
[136:22.19]Okay, here we go.
[136:28.41]I'm doing this up to five to ten minutes.
[136:30.51]And that's it.
[136:59.40]I gotta turn that off, it's too much.
[137:00.56]This is horrifying.
[137:12.83]Okay, I'm done.
[137:24.95]No, I'm not gonna keep it up and keep it times two.
[137:27.57]Okay, there are 30,000 people here.
[137:31.50]What a weird, like, it would, I feel like if I clicked on this stream, they're watching a times two speed baby sensory video.
[137:40.80]Why are they doing this?
[137:42.07]What's wrong with them?
[137:46.03]This is cultish at this point of us just sitting here like two times baby sensory videos.
[137:52.61]This is getting, I don't know.
[137:53.75]It's freaking me out.
[137:54.95]I don't think I can do it.
[137:58.76]I'll do times two for 10 more seconds.
[138:01.64]Ready?
[138:26.18]It is WarioWare.

[138:39.99]Get the fuck out of here.
[138:40.89]Get this fucking thing off the screen right now.
[138:43.39]No way.
[138:50.51]Yeah, but like 3,000 people have left the stream.
[138:53.37]This is off.
[138:55.53]Like, immediately.
[139:00.40]Let's put on a You Laugh, You Lose.
[139:04.02]I've got a lot of ideas on this stream.
[139:06.36]Some of them need to go through the first phase of the carbon filter for your sink.
[139:12.36]Holy shit.
[139:20.13]Okay, best one guy moment.
[139:26.26]Alright, let me, give me one sec.

[145:08.12]This is 2013.
[145:09.22]Well, we're off the original playlist.
[145:13.22]I've been here for two and a half hours doing this?
[145:16.70]Holy shit.
[145:17.40]Damn.
[145:21.38]Alright.

[146:18.86]That sounded like his teeth.
[146:23.58]I don't get it.
[147:10.95]Yeah, these are too quick for me to react to.
[147:12.51]My brain like moves on.
[147:23.70]The baby video was better?
[147:33.10]When's Otto's birthday?
[147:34.18]Otto's birthday is... We don't know.
[147:36.84]Probably somewhere around March.
[147:39.52]Because Otto's a rescue, so I don't know exactly when.
[147:42.90]But they think March.
[147:43.76]Somewhere between March and May.
[147:49.22]What happened to the TV resolution burn-in guy?
[147:52.03]It was a joke we got had.
[147:54.45]He sent another video that was him doing a Rickroll.
[147:58.23]So, that was the ultimate one guy.
[148:01.13]For sure.
[148:03.79]We're on animal videos?
[148:08.97]Alright, let's get this one out.
[148:11.07]And then I'm going to take one more break.
[148:13.19]And we'll see if we get another one coming up.
[148:27.45]What's up, house?
[148:29.07]Alright, alright.
[148:30.11]I'm nervous.
[148:32.09]It's so hot.
[148:36.99]I could feel that all the way over here.
[148:38.33]We're on America's Funniest Home Videos?
[148:40.99]Did we just watch an old episode of America's Funniest Home Videos?
[148:44.75]That actually sounds awesome.
[148:51.02]Don't worry about that.
[148:53.90]I'm just realizing what this poor guy just did.
[148:56.04]What just happened?
[148:56.62]The whole tree fell apart.
[148:58.05]What the...
[149:22.11]Hold on, I need to see what you're talking about.
[149:28.39]Somebody said they thought that this guy was a dog.
[149:31.66]It is a dog.
[149:37.00]What are you talking about?
[149:45.12]I thought that guy was a dog.
[149:47.30]Yeah, because it was a dog.
[150:09.66]I was waiting for like the chandelier to fall Like I thought it was gonna be like the chandelier was gonna go like in the background or something I was like, what the hell is this video?
[150:32.78]Watch how it's made.
[150:34.86]Are we going just full React Andy today?
[150:36.54]Is that what it is?
[150:41.48]Alright, let me go pee.
[150:43.64]Let me get like two or three more.
[150:45.00]Ready to go.
[150:47.88]I'll be right back.
[150:50.80]How it's made on x10 speed.
[150:52.54]Dude, my favorite part is the zoomer sensory videos.
[150:59.24]It's so funny.
[151:01.02]I'll be right back.
[151:02.29]You just peed?
[151:05.28]I've been drinking water.
[153:12.97]Thank you.
[154:16.35]Somebody said, do a baby sensory stream where you treat us like babies.
[154:23.55]No.
[154:24.65]I don't think so.
[154:25.21]Alright, here's what we're going to do.
[154:40.08]I only really planned on this stream being about three hours.
[154:43.12]So, we will watch maybe one or two little things here.
[154:49.45]And then I was going to be live tomorrow with Monster Rancher.
[154:55.24]End of the stream, boys?
[154:56.08]Not yet.
[154:59.21]I mean, there's only so many, like, hours in a row of just meme content that your brain can accept.
[155:04.43]That, like, Facebook video where I got locked and that added $1,000 to the pool.
[155:14.18]Yeah, I mean, after three hours of this, you kind of funny it out.
[155:19.35]But I want to finish Monster Rancher.
[155:28.63]And what else?
[155:33.65]I don't think we'll be in Monster Ranch for that much longer.
[155:35.67]I don't think so.
[155:44.28]The baby sensory thing was a fun idea, and then in practice was just way too much.
[155:50.18]That's way too much for me and way too much for you.
[155:53.20]Especially at x2 speed.
[155:54.70]Oh, no way.
[155:59.12]It was horrible.
[156:08.21]Yeah, I don't think I can put on America's Funniest Home Videos.
[156:11.43]Like the one that's the current season.
[156:12.81]Let me move this.
[156:23.22]It was perfect.
[156:25.02]I mean, I think it was funny once I realized I had to leave.
[156:33.58]So, let me go over this real quick, too, though.
[156:39.29]We want more.
[156:40.15]We want more.
[156:41.03]Watch the dancing fruits one.
[156:42.35]Alright, I'll put on the dancing fruit one, and then after that, I'm probably just gonna go.
[156:48.70]And we'll be live tomorrow with video games.
[156:58.34]It's too much.
[157:02.42]You know those, like, three-plus-hour-long meme compilations?
[157:10.00]After hour number two of that, I kind of want to go, like, eat a sandwich.
[157:19.92]Alright, what was I going over here?
[157:21.04]Okay.
[157:22.32]Let's put on the baby sensory dancing fruit one.
[157:29.10]Let me break down where this money's going to go, by the way.
[157:33.04]There is a dancing fruit wine, you're right.
[157:45.88]Okay.
[157:48.61]Please peep the horror.
[157:50.81]I think I did that for like five straight minutes on the sensory stream.
[157:53.83]I don't think you need me to do that again.
[157:55.83]Alright, let's break this down.
[157:59.41]Coming back.
[158:02.93]I don't think it's even accurate anymore, the flashing lights thing.
[158:06.41]Hey, who knows?
[158:07.57]Maybe this stuff isn't very engaging to a child's brain.
[158:10.15]I don't know.
[158:15.10]Just in case.
[158:16.50]Okay.
[158:21.32]Uh, okay.
[158:21.98]Fruit salad dance party.
[158:25.10]Hey.
[158:25.24]Hey.
[158:33.46]You just peeped the horror for 20 minutes, yo.
[158:35.12]I can say I kind of like this video.
[159:03.05]This ain't bad.
[159:05.93]This one's not bad.
[159:12.77]How do you guys feel right now?
[159:14.17]Like this very second if I asked you.
[159:15.95]And I had a piece of paper and I wrote it down.
[159:18.05]How do you feel?
[159:22.74]Good.
[159:23.24]Chill.
[159:23.54]Groovy.
[159:25.34]Stimulated.
[159:26.02]Yep.
[159:28.76]Mind controlled.
[159:37.27]hungry how long does this go for oh my it's just it's this for 20 minutes does the song change don't spoil the video
[160:07.95]Somebody just came in and said... Dude, what do we do here?
[160:14.40]Is this guy just opening up and watching baby videos?
[160:20.64]This is exactly what I told you was going to happen!
[160:24.20]Oh, shit!
[160:29.09]No!
[160:30.05]What the fuck?
[160:33.47]Oh, well.
[160:34.45]Is it alright?
[160:34.97]Is this...
[160:44.91]Is it turning on?
[160:47.49]Okay.
[160:47.77]No, no.
[160:48.01]It's alright.
[160:48.47]It's alright.
[160:51.33]So, anyways.
[160:53.06]That's exactly what I told you.
[160:54.00]I told you exactly that's what was going to happen.
[160:56.54]And it exactly did.
[161:01.76]Okay.
[161:02.20]So.
[161:03.16]No, this is not what we do here.
[161:04.48]This is one of many things that happen on this channel.
[161:11.23]You were vibing?
[161:11.91]Alright.
[161:12.23]Let's vibe for another 30 seconds.
[161:22.18]What's wrong with your lighting?
[161:23.06]I've been here for two hours.
[161:25.50]This is like a lamp I have that's just right here.
[161:27.84]It's like a little digital lamp thing.
[161:39.71]Alright.
[161:40.61]If the next fruit is a banana, I will add $100.
[162:02.28]Somebody said, oh, wow, man, it's a bunch of little dancing fruits just for me.
[162:09.18]Oh, no, yeah, it didn't change.
[162:09.88]You're right.
[162:18.84]Banana, right?
[162:19.52]Not even kidding, this is your worst stream of the year.
[162:30.67]Too bad nominations are closed.
[162:37.70]Ah, strawberry.
[162:50.91]Oh well.
[162:53.79]This is your worst dream for next year.
[162:55.25]Oh, I see what you're doing.
[162:59.73]I didn't pre-watch.
[163:00.49]What are you talking about?
[163:05.91]Holy sh- Wait, this just keep- Oh, there's banana.
[163:08.85]Okay.
[163:15.99]What'd you say?
[163:16.43]This is one?
[163:18.83]Remember, this is- This is the first time I've seen you live.
[163:20.99]Is this what it's always like?
[163:21.95]No, that's- You said what the last person said.
[163:27.85]Spoilers.
[163:28.37]Alright, let me take Baby Sensory out of the title.
[163:31.87]Because I- Alright, there's no more.
[163:34.99]There's no more baby sensory.
[163:39.24]I'll give you 60 more seconds.
[163:51.77]Somebody said put on animal sensory.
[163:53.69]Like dogs, cats, birds.
[163:57.05]I don't... I think the same shit's gonna happen.
[164:04.25]Just stand still and stare at the video.
[164:08.05]No, I mean, 7,000 people have already left.
[164:11.51]When Baby Sensory turned on.
[164:17.67]So I don't want to get the rest of you gone.
[164:22.07]Okay, let me do this.
[164:30.27]The weakest 7,000.
[164:35.15]Do MasterChef.
[164:37.03]No, you've seen it a million times.
[164:40.77]You've seen that a million times.
[164:45.11]So, let me get this out of the way first.
[164:48.36]If you came for the You Laugh, You Lose.
[164:51.02]I've never done that before.
[164:52.22]It was really fun.
[164:54.26]I'm going to update this because there was at least a few more.
[164:57.98]So, that takes us to $3,500.
[165:07.04]This is not a beginner Jerma stream.
[165:08.56]Well, this is a React Andy for three hours stream.
[165:15.58]I'll be live tomorrow, though.
[165:18.92]This is not just a one stream here this week.
[165:21.56]I'll be live tomorrow.
[165:23.60]Alright, so $3,500 is going to go to the... I think I want to send it to that science center in Nevada.
[165:35.15]So I will be able to have, uh, if you remember from the Bugleberry hot tub stream, there was about, I think 7,500 bucks came in.
[165:44.78]So to Science Center in Nevada, that actually makes it perfect.
[165:50.14]Cause that would be, well, I'll just round it out.
[165:54.64]That'd be five.
[165:55.36]I was going to do 5,000 to Science Center.
[165:58.66]So then plus 3,500.
[166:01.52]So here's what I'm going to do.
[166:04.66]I'm going to send $10,000 to the Nevada Science Center to kind of make sure that was combined with the other one too.
[166:13.53]So that is going to go to their center.
[166:18.28]I really, really can't wait to send that.
[166:26.94]It'll be 11k.
[166:27.96]Well, I was going to round up from the Bugleberry stuff.
[166:34.57]Somebody said, I'm an offer.
[166:35.43]I know it's your hardship, but I want to, can you fund my interest in yo-yos?
[166:39.79]Why did I read that comment?
[166:45.59]I had a good time.
[166:46.37]I knew this wasn't going to last very long.
[166:48.31]And especially when baby sensory is like, that takes a turn off the road.
[166:53.10]And I'm, no, not going to happen.
[167:01.63]He's a philanthropist.
[167:02.53]Well, here's the thing.
[167:03.75]I promised back in like July or August or something that that money was actually going to get used and sent to these places.
[167:11.82]So I want to get that in there.
[167:22.52]What if you did a yo-yo trick?
[167:23.58]Stop with the yo-yo.
[167:24.36]What's with the yo-yos?
[167:32.72]Alright, that's it.
[167:34.08]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[167:37.80]I could pivot to Monster Rancher, but I'd rather just do a whole day of it tomorrow.
[167:43.71]Because I think we're pretty much near the end.
[167:47.35]Let me type this so people know.
[167:50.78]The final, so it'd be 35.
[167:56.26]No, no, yeah, you're right.
[167:57.74]So it'd be 11.5.
[168:05.19]Yeah, because I was going to do five and then... Oh, no.
[168:11.15]I'll split it.
[168:11.79]I'll send some to another place, too.
[168:13.19]I was going to do one of the humane societies out here.
[168:27.56]Alright.
[168:28.32]There you go.
[168:34.59]$10,000 to the Science Center in Nevada, Nevada Science Center.
[168:38.22]If you don't know who that is and you're wondering why, you might be if you're a new viewer or not, they helped out to do the geology, archaeology stream, and they were really, really, really nice people.
[168:49.94]So hopefully they can use it for something cool.
[168:55.33]Oh, I need an N.
[169:02.36]And that'll wrap up today.
[169:03.20]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[169:05.20]I'll do a full, probably six plus hours of Monster Rancher tomorrow.
[169:08.75]And then, when we're out and no more Monster Rancher, what am I going to do?
[169:13.21]That's been my game for like two or three weeks.
[169:16.91]I have to find something else to do.
[169:20.37]I'm going to go watch Baby Sensory.
[169:25.72]What you guys bet, you guys bet earlier.
[169:29.86]Over or under 5,000.
[169:30.94]Oh, man.
[169:32.04]Okay.
[169:38.22]Have a great night.
[169:39.08]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[169:41.01]There were a lot of gifted subs, too.
[169:42.23]I appreciate it.
[169:52.95]Thank you guys a lot.
[169:56.42]That was more fun than I thought.
[170:02.76]I think the next time I would want to do it, I would want to, if I was going to spend more than two, three hours doing that, most of these compilations, people kind of do it for like an hour, right?
[170:16.37]Raiden Yanners.
[170:17.33]Alright, yeah.
[170:19.09]Hope you had a good time.
[170:19.91]I did.
[170:20.21]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[170:25.14]Thanks, everybody.
[170:25.86]See you tomorrow.
[170:27.14]Monster Rancher 2.
[170:28.16]Have a great night.
[170:31.51]Sorry I screamed at you earlier too.
[170:36.48]Just trying to scare you.
[170:39.66]I'll see you tomorrow.
[170:44.94]Put sensory on the credits.
[170:48.26]No.
[170:50.18]It wasn't actually scary.
[170:51.25]Yeah, I know.
[170:51.69]I was just messing around.
[170:53.97]I was just having fun.
[171:03.10]Alright, go say hello to Nieners.
[171:08.28]What is, what is, what you doing?
[171:11.51]Let's take a look.
[171:18.59]Okay.
[171:18.75]Let me get it going, first of all.
[171:25.89]Okay.
[171:36.41]Alright, what you doing?
[171:37.83]Just chatting.
[171:38.69]Avoid baby sensory videos.
[171:44.58]I don't know what you're doing, Nianers.
[171:46.90]3D, wait, new 3D winter model?
[171:52.62]Okay.
[171:54.69]Everybody go take a look.
[171:56.69]Apparently a new 3D winter model.
[172:04.11]Say hello to Nianers.
[172:05.95]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[172:06.59]Thanks for watching.
[172:07.37]Good night.
[172:07.91]Goodbye.
[172:08.55]See you soon.
[172:55.85]Thank you.
