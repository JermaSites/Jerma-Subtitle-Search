[ve:60.16.100]

[00:47.94]I absolutely knew it.
[00:49.09]I knew I should have prayed to the devil.
[00:50.81]I knew that devil procedure was a good one.
[00:56.43]Signed a paper this afternoon.
[00:59.23]Got on there.
[01:00.39]Went to his office.
[01:01.97]Went to the devil's office.
[01:04.27]He poofed up in front of me with chairs.
[01:06.85]He was sitting in a chair with his name tag.
[01:09.81]And I sold my soul to the devil.
[01:12.87]I gave him whatever was left of it, you know, to be able to stream for one hour on Thursday.
[01:19.18]And that's today.
[01:20.58]So... I think we got it.
[01:23.90]I get one hour of streaming here.
[01:26.50]That's all it was.
[01:28.90]And I wanted the unfinished sandwich on his desk.
[01:33.52]That took a lot of... That fucking master negotiator here.
[01:36.66]Took a little negotiating to get that one.
[01:38.91]Got half a sandwich.
[01:40.35]And I get to stream with no internet problems.
[01:42.88]Looks like we're good to go.
[01:43.74]What do you say?
[01:51.94]I'm just describing Cuphead.
[01:54.20]Kind of.
[01:54.48]Except that was a casino.
[01:56.81]It's a little different.
[01:58.41]Anyways, hi.
[01:59.09]I'm... I'm scared.
[02:04.21]I'm paranoid.
[02:04.85]I'm terrified.
[02:06.67]Because it seems like every other time I turn this stream on, it doesn't work.
[02:11.56]And the internet just refuses to let me do what I want to do.
[02:16.54]So... We're gonna hang out for a second here.
[02:21.47]Just watch that orbit for a while.
[02:26.43]Go, go, do something quick.
[02:29.63]So, yeah, we're gonna do a condensed stream today.
[02:32.91]Where I'm gonna try just to do something.
[02:34.69]In like an hour.
[02:38.56]And hopefully we're still going.
[02:40.16]And if not, then whatever.
[02:41.10]And if we are, then whatever.
[02:42.88]If this continues to be a problem...
[02:45.62]I'm gonna have to change the schedule for a little while until I can actually get a real technician out here to fix it.
[02:55.00]Because I don't want to do this shit anymore.
[02:57.02]This exact same problem happened back last year.
[03:02.30]And it was just a gamble of whether or not I was gonna click the button and my stream was gonna work.
[03:06.55]So we'll see how it goes tonight.
[03:07.59]We're gonna play... We're gonna start with Neighbors from Hell.
[03:14.45]Is that even what's on the list?
[03:16.23]There, no.
[03:16.81]I'm under talk shows right now.
[03:19.69]Alright, let me change from talk shows.
[03:21.17]Uh, this game does not, uh, does not look good.
[03:27.36]It does look like it could be fun.
[03:29.72]We might really get a little bit of material out of this, you know?
[03:32.96]Currently writing my new stand-up gig.
[03:35.16]Might get a little bit of material.
[03:37.48]Probably some funny anecdotes I can get from this one, you know what I'm saying?
[03:41.94]So, I'm gonna be watching this like a hawk.
[03:44.14]My internet.
[03:46.40]And the second that I see even a glimpse that we're going down.
[03:50.39]You know like that old adage, where the captain goes down with the ship?
[03:54.21]No.
[03:55.33]No, if I see like red and I start dropping every other frame again, I'm burning the ship.
[04:01.35]I'm getting off.
[04:03.53]No, I'm not gonna burn, I'm just gonna leave the ship, right?
[04:05.41]The captain doesn't go down.
[04:06.41]I'm going to just call in like an airdrop.
[04:09.21]And grab, the helicopter's gonna swing by.
[04:11.86]And I'm gonna grab onto the ladder while it swings by, Indiana Jones style, and fly up, and everyone's gonna be just still on the boat, and I'm gonna be like, I'm outta here, motherfuckers!
[04:25.34]Why would I, why would I, like, destroy the boat?
[04:30.50]Anyways, let's, we have, we have the time here.
[04:34.24]Let's go ahead and move this over, this neighbor's from hell.
[04:37.02]Neighbor's from hell.
[04:39.21]Neighbor's from hell.
[04:42.45]Hopefully it's not too loud.
[04:43.41]I'm sure it is, because everything is.
[04:44.75]I do need to restart it, though.
[04:47.61]Let's go ahead and do that.
[04:50.53]I do need to restart it, though.
[04:53.52]Hey!
[04:55.16]Joe Wood Production presents Neighbors from Hell of Revenge is a sweet game.
[04:57.58]Cool.
[04:59.88]We'll get some awesome MIDI music to start.
[05:03.84]This is a game where you murder your neighbor, apparently.
[05:08.35]And we're supposed to think this is funny.
[05:09.41]Killing animals, too?
[05:10.13]Really?
[05:10.75]Really?
[05:13.71]Kinda looks like me.
[05:14.39]I mean, if the nose is a little bit more up here, that could be me.
[05:23.09]And look at how much of an angel I am!
[05:27.43]Alright, let's go.
[05:30.75]Oh, I hate that I have, like, the cursor in the cursor here.
[05:33.36]That's gonna cause me a ton of pain.
[05:36.34]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[05:37.20]I gotta get rid of that.
[05:38.30]Just give me a second.
[05:38.98]Let me just get rid of that shit.
[05:44.89]There we go.
[05:46.03]Alright, now my... my brain can handle it.
[05:51.00]Start game.
[05:52.28]Introduction.
[05:53.50]Uh, this is Woody.
[05:55.60]Uh, 100% minimum rating, 0-0 minimum durations.
[05:58.49]I don't know what that means.
[05:59.79]There's no tutorial, I don't think.
[06:01.95]Listen carefully to what the director has to tell you.
[06:04.45]It will make things a lot... Okay, but this is the tutorial.
[06:08.44]You can practice before the show begins.
[06:09.86]Here you can try out the controlling Woody.
[06:11.93]They can go through doors and change floors.
[06:13.85]Try this out before plunging into the f***ing shirt.
[06:19.47]Alright, so Funny Dog Entertainment presents Neighbors from Hell.
[06:24.49]In first steps.
[06:25.49]So this is like a TV show.
[06:28.27]Welcome to Nickelodeon from Hell.
[06:29.93]I'm Joe, the director of the show.
[06:32.01]In the course of the following three episodes, you will learn how to kill your neighbor.
[06:36.25]The hero of our show, Woody, played nasty tricks on his neighbor.
[06:40.71]You can give Woody commands with the mouse.
[06:42.20]To do this, just move the mouse and point and click on the button.
[06:46.00]Press the left mouse button to make Woody execute your neighbor.
[06:50.74]The action indicates... Okay, I'm like... My ADHD is through the fucking roof right now.
[06:54.94]You just left-click to move.
[06:56.24]Okay.
[06:57.61]Perfect, let Woody go through the now unlocked door into room A to get to your next target.
[07:02.07]Do this left click on the door.
[07:03.09]Okay, easy enough.
[07:07.88]I can't read.
[07:08.72]No, I can read.
[07:10.70]Very good, your screen shows only a part of the house.
[07:13.82]You can look at other parts of the house with the help of your mouse or the directional keys of your keyboard.
[07:19.32]This is what's called scrolling.
[07:22.26]Oh.
[07:23.18]Now scroll to the left and send Woody to his second target.
[07:26.24]I'm not gonna use the arrow keys.
[07:29.01]How about that?
[07:31.00]Doors at the back hall always connect floors.
[07:33.84]They lead to the door directly above or below it.
[07:37.64]In order to send Woody to his third target, you can enter... You can either click on the door at the back wall and then on the target, or you can left click... It's fucking music!
[07:45.97]You wanna see what happens when I don't have music in my ears?
[07:49.71]I'm telling you guys, this is why.
[07:52.60]Watch this.
[07:54.66]In order to send Woody to his third target, you can either click on the door at the back wall and then on the target, or you can left-click straight on the target in room C. It's the music!
[08:05.17]If somebody's playing music in my ears, I can't speak.
[08:09.83]It's the goddamn music.
[08:10.99]Alright, what am I looking at here?
[08:12.35]Right here.
[08:14.53]Just click on it.
[08:15.29]The target, it's easier to do that.
[08:16.29]I don't have to click on the door.
[08:19.81]Well done!
[08:20.31]You've learned the basic elements for controlling Woody.
[08:22.23]Now you can go to objects through doors and into further rooms.
[08:27.52]Now get Woody to leave the house through the front door, and you'll have completed the introductory episode.
[08:32.38]That was the worst thing ever because I... I know how easy that is to do.
[08:37.49]Nice.
[08:40.59]Brilliant.
[08:41.33]One of the one tricks.
[08:42.15]Viewer rating, 100%.
[08:45.76]Thanks, guys.
[08:46.64]I appreciate the 100% rating that the stream has right now.
[08:50.78]Alright, onward and upwards.
[08:53.75]Woody's playing a trick.
[08:55.51]We're going to learn how to do some things.
[08:58.19]We're just going to learn how to play.
[09:00.81]How we set up our neighbor here for being too loud.
[09:04.37]What's with the loading thing?
[09:07.28]Do I control two characters?
[09:09.16]Yes!
[09:15.75]So, I can't wait to play this game.
[09:17.39]Because you know that that audio clip is going to be used like 50 times when I put a stick of dynamite down this guy's throat.
[09:23.82]Hi, it's Joe.
[09:26.26]This time, I'd like to show you some things Woody can do.
[09:29.08]Okay, we're going to skim through this one.
[09:34.09]Woody, look at the important object.
[09:35.29]Clicking the left mouse, you got it.
[09:41.94]Uh-huh.
[09:42.38]That plant smells nice.
[09:44.42]You'll often find useful items in drawers, chests, or drawers, furniture, objects found in the inventory.
[09:48.87]If you find it, you click something that goes in your inventory at the bottom of the screen.
[09:52.11]Left-click on the chest or drawers to make sure you don't have to look inside of it and never click anywhere in the hidden treasure in there.
[09:57.85]See?
[09:59.43]We've got marbles and a syringe.
[10:01.11]Alright.
[10:03.03]You found something.
[10:03.53]Just leave your mouse pointer on the object for a while to have a closer look at those newly found objects in your inventory.
[10:09.30]You can all use objects from your inventory with other objects.
[10:12.84]Please left click on the syringe gun.
[10:15.92]Which it now stands out.
[10:18.88]And use it with the picture in the room.
[10:22.30]On the upper floor by clicking on the picture.
[10:25.34]Okay, cool.
[10:26.46]So we're really gonna like really scribble on his aunt's face.
[10:32.80]This is Carl from Aqua Team.
[10:36.24]Okay.
[10:38.75]okay vandalism that's real okay the audience didn't think that was that funny so I can do a little bit but I can do more work there brilliant progress it's dare to turn the music back on so like I anytime I have trouble with like reading or studying or something I need a little bit of music to help me it calms my nerves down it lets me stay in check that's the reason why I'm having trouble reading this right now
[11:06.45]Brilliant, see?
[11:07.87]A progress bar above Woody's head shows you the duration of an action.
[11:11.64]Giving Woody another order during an action will cancel the current action, which is left incomplete.
[11:16.76]Let Woody go back to the lower floor to make the neighbor move.
[11:22.32]Okay, so he's going to come over and he's going to be really upset about this, right?
[11:27.99]Now the neighbor is on the way, walking past the picture, he'll notice that it's smeared and will get angry.
[11:31.75]Hmm?
[11:32.27]Huh?
[11:32.47]Why not?
[11:32.69]I'm not saying I don't.
[11:38.16]Each time the neighbor gets angry, more points are added to Woody's ratings at the bottom right.
[11:43.14]Keep an eye on the neighbor's picture at the bottom left, too.
[11:45.57]As soon as he walks into a trap, his anger indicator increases and then goes down again.
[11:51.49]If the neighbor walks into another trap before this bar is back to zero, I'll get a bonus.
[11:57.84]Now please make Woody put the marbles on the floor in room B, but take care that the neighbor doesn't catch you doing it, otherwise you'll have to repeat the introduction.
[12:08.23]Okay, so we're gonna go up here.
[12:10.15]So he's gonna go back and forth.
[12:11.67]If I can't talk right now, I'm gonna put this phone onto silent mode so I don't get interrupted.
[12:16.71]Alright, so we're gonna go B, put the marbles down, wait for him to do one more turn.
[12:23.12]Played this game years ago.
[12:24.28]Yeah, it's a classic.
[12:28.02]Yeah, wait for the neighbor patrol to go by.
[12:30.14]Here we go, let's put the marbles down right here.
[12:34.35]And marbles.
[12:35.49]Put them right here.
[12:36.63]Put them right here so this guy breaks his fucking neck.
[12:39.27]Alright, let's go back down to the room and watch the hilarity unfold.
[12:44.81]Oh, boy.
[12:46.61]Zoom in.
[12:47.10]Get a good shot of this.
[12:51.40]Oh!
[12:51.54]That was very good.
[12:54.36]How did I only get a 97% rating?
[13:05.30]Uh, pay attention to the neighbor's thought bubble to see where he is headed and which objects he wants to use.
[13:11.06]These items can often be used for tricks.
[13:13.39]Now enjoy the neighbor slipping on the marbles.
[13:15.49]See you in the next episode.
[13:18.05]Alright, now we're learning our expert moves.
[13:22.81]I need to combo.
[13:23.65]Okay, so you can sneak if you hold right mouse button.
[13:29.94]And then we can finally move on.
[13:35.34]The name is Repelant, and this is the dog.
[13:39.35]The last box.
[13:41.31]Okay, we're currently going with the dog.
[13:43.53]Am I the dog?
[13:45.27]No.
[13:51.61]The dog has one of those cartoon sausage dog noses.
[13:55.33]Alright.
[13:55.74]Uh, noses.
[13:56.42]Why don't I just eat that word?
[13:58.06]You'll have to make Woody sneak past the animal to prevent the... To do this, you'll have to use the right instead of left mouse button for your actions.
[14:07.14]A right click on the floor, on a door, or an object will make Woody sneak there.
[14:12.68]Once there, he can get creative without the pet raising the alarm.
[14:16.50]Please have Woody first take the marbles from the chest of drawers to try this out.
[14:22.06]Alright.
[14:23.82]Got him.
[14:24.72]So now if I right-click... Now, what if we put those on the floor in room B, on the upper floor, but instead of using the left, right mouse button.
[14:33.02]Okay, so right mouse button plays different music.
[14:36.05]The music gets a little bit quieter.
[14:38.63]The music gets a little bit quieter.
[14:40.87]That's an interesting take on the genre.
[14:43.75]Okay, now... We're going to put them right here.
[14:48.90]And he...
[14:58.75]Yeah, stupid dog, you don't know anything.
[15:01.91]So, I guess I have to right-click.
[15:03.99]He's gonna go back to bed.
[15:07.16]Go back to bed.
[15:11.60]Alright, sneak.
[15:13.84]So, use marbles with... Okay, yeah, you have to right-click.
[15:21.89]Alright, what are you doing?
[15:22.99]Why would you put them all the way back here?
[15:24.31]I clicked right here!
[15:26.47]I clicked right over here.
[15:27.41]Why did he put them over here?
[15:28.27]This just looks like a gumball machine broke.
[15:32.13]Okay, well, I don't think he's gonna do this.
[15:37.03]Hide in the wardrobe.
[15:39.13]Oh, fuck.
[15:41.71]As long as Woody is hiding in the wardrobe or under the bed, the neighbor and his pets can't see you or whatever.
[15:45.77]He's gonna trip over the marbles at any moment here.
[15:50.47]Now you've learned all that's necessary to pay back.
[15:52.29]Wait a minute.
[15:53.28]I think I'm supposed to put them on the ground here.
[15:58.63]Was I supposed to put him on the ground here?
[15:59.75]He did it on purpose.
[16:05.37]He did it on purpose for a laugh.
[16:09.85]Got him!
[16:10.31]Is this neighbor the Wallace and Gromit guy?
[16:13.98]Alright, here we go.
[16:17.62]No more fucking around.
[16:18.56]We're ready to play the real game.
[16:19.98]Season 1.
[16:22.14]The neighbor is quite a nasty customer, as will become obvious over time.
[16:26.64]It's a rare thing to find him quietly sitting on his sofa.
[16:30.20]And we all know the exception proves the rule.
[16:32.90]But what if he keeps so quiet only to keep a more watchful eye on everything around him?
[16:37.38]Woody, for one, doesn't like it at all.
[16:40.32]So he decides to drop in on his neighbor.
[16:42.16]So I'm just a psychopath.
[16:48.05]So my problem with my neighbor is that he's quiet and sleeps a lot.
[16:54.15]Yeah, I have a really quiet- that's the- that's the perfect neighbor!
[16:58.21]You don't want to fucking mess with this guy, this is the perfect neighbor!
[17:01.59]He keeps to himself, he's quiet, and he doesn't bother anybody.
[17:08.02]Wow, okay.
[17:09.80]Let's- might as well go hit him in the head with a bat!
[17:11.50]Let's do it.
[17:24.86]Alright, so we got a locked, uh, we got a locked device.
[17:30.20]Of course the game wants us with this first level one.
[17:32.12]We gotta pick up the marbles.
[17:33.79]No, that's a whoopee cushion.
[17:34.73]Alright, whoopee cushion.
[17:35.49]He's got a favorite chair.
[17:37.43]What else?
[17:37.77]This is a locked door.
[17:40.03]Is he coming down this way?
[17:42.05]No, he's going to the kitchen.
[17:42.77]No, no, don't go in the kitchen.
[17:44.27]Telephone?
[17:44.67]No.
[17:46.34]Can I shit in the plant?
[17:47.68]Should I piss in the plant?
[17:51.00]Okay, now I understand.
[18:00.19]This guy's day-to-day is real, uh, real interesting, huh?
[18:05.69]So, he goes and... spies on somebody.
[18:09.36]And watches TV.
[18:11.20]How often does he do that a day?
[18:12.48]Oh, we're gonna both be cushioned, but hold on, let's go to the bathroom first.
[18:18.00]Uh, anything in the toilet?
[18:19.09]Medicine cabinet?
[18:22.17]Super glue?
[18:22.95]Alright, we're gonna super glue him to the chair.
[18:25.18]It's gonna really, really irritate him.
[18:27.20]Whoopie cushion or super glue?
[18:28.12]Because then he won't be able to get out and I'll get a lot of laughs for that one.
[18:33.44]Let me know.
[18:35.79]Whoopie cushion or sofa?
[18:37.47]Alright, TV, turn the TV off.
[18:39.37]WAIT!
[18:51.02]Alright, I understand.
[18:52.14]I get it.
[18:52.46]I get it.
[18:55.22]I get it.
[18:55.42]I just got my ass kicked, but it's alright.
[18:56.82]I get it.
[18:58.14]I wasn't paying attention.
[18:59.02]Alright, here we go.
[19:04.92]Got the marbles.
[19:05.96]We'll do the super glue too.
[19:07.24]I mean, I can hide.
[19:08.04]He's gonna do the thing again.
[19:08.90]Don't worry.
[19:09.14]Get up off the cushion.
[19:16.15]How can somebody possibly be bad at this game?
[19:20.03]Dude, I'm bad at the game.
[19:22.89]I'm trying to figure out dumb shit to do.
[19:26.92]Whoopie cushion.
[19:27.40]We're going to leave here.
[19:30.36]We're going to hide in the closet here.
[19:31.84]Because he's going to want to know who's doing this.
[19:36.27]What do you have to do?
[19:37.37]Trick him five times or something?
[19:40.79]We've got to set up combos too.
[19:41.87]I just want to see how this works.
[19:46.64]Why would that embarrass you?
[19:47.52]Alright, here he goes.
[19:52.98]Oh, shit.
[19:53.34]He didn't even get up.
[19:54.04]Alright.
[19:54.36]I thought he was going to start running around the house.
[19:58.51]So, what, you're telling me this guy cares more about just, like, spying on people and watching TV than something that might be in your house?
[20:04.89]Superglue on the toilet?
[20:07.67]Superglue on the floor?
[20:08.33]No, alright.
[20:10.56]I got the superglue for a reason, though.
[20:12.49]I'm gonna say Super Blue on the binoculars might be a good trick.
[20:16.97]I think that's a good trick.
[20:20.37]What else, though?
[20:21.01]Those are the only two places he goes.
[20:22.68]Alright, it's gonna get stuck to his head.
[20:31.70]That's cool.
[20:33.74]I mean, is it cool or is it not cool?
[20:35.40]It's probably not cool.
[20:37.74]Alright, let's see what he does.
[20:42.04]I can go in the fridge too, but it's too late.
[20:46.20]Yeah, we're gonna have to wait until next time.
[20:51.06]Breaking and entering the game.
[20:56.03]Wait, what about up here?
[20:57.49]He's gonna get stuck in his eyes.
[20:58.65]Oh no, he lost the binoculars.
[21:06.29]What's he gonna do?
[21:10.59]Back in the kitchen?
[21:14.64]I guess he's just going back to sit down on the sofa.
[21:16.68]Alright, we got microwave.
[21:22.43]A microwave?
[21:23.01]I've heard that eggs explode when they're cooked.
[21:24.71]Alright, eggs explode when they cook in the microwave.
[21:29.85]We got eggs.
[21:31.87]Get out, get out, get out, get out!
[21:33.25]There's no more binoculars left.
[21:36.81]What the hell is this guy gonna do?
[21:39.70]He threw them out the window.
[21:45.51]Okay.
[21:48.03]So, I mean, I guess I'm gonna put the egg in the microwave?
[21:52.59]I probably should wait till he... I'll probably do something with the piano.
[21:57.45]Alright, egg in the microwave.
[22:03.52]Alright, let's leave.
[22:05.82]He's gonna come by and he's gonna be so upset that his egg exploded in the microwave.
[22:13.55]That dude tested an IRL.
[22:15.15]I have one more trick to play on this guy, but I don't know what it is.
[22:25.10]There's only the bathroom.
[22:26.64]He hasn't got marbles, I guess?
[22:29.52]Okay, we're gonna do some combos.
[22:32.09]No, there's not.
[22:33.95]I have one minute to figure out what I should do here.
[22:35.73]It's the TV.
[22:39.72]I would assume it would be something in the bathroom, but no.
[22:41.75]Let's wait till he gets up and then... I'm starting to understand you want to get like all four to happen in a row.
[22:47.89]That's a joke.
[22:51.83]There we go.
[22:54.93]They're here outside.
[22:55.95]It's the most boring fucking life ever.
[23:01.96]This is where I rigged the TV.
[23:03.28]To hurt you.
[23:04.58]And there it is.
[23:11.85]Oh no, my precious television!
[23:21.98]Brilliant.
[23:22.58]I got a 91% rating.
[23:26.18]Can I get this, like, hourglass off the screen?
[23:30.58]Pay attention to the neighbor's thoughts.
[23:34.55]Lounging around in front of the TV, drinking a pint.
[23:37.81]He goes, he drinks a shitload of beer.
[23:40.09]How do you play tricks on him?
[23:42.86]Alright, so he's gonna go back and forth to the fridge.
[23:44.70]Let's plan out our torture.
[23:50.63]Let's actually get a good six combo here.
[23:58.85]Why do I care about this game?
[24:00.17]Alright, let's go item collecting here.
[24:02.67]I know where all the items are.
[24:06.77]Okay, never mind.
[24:07.85]I thought that was going to be marbles.
[24:09.01]We're going right to the murder weapons.
[24:10.43]Alright, that's interesting.
[24:12.77]Beer.
[24:14.44]Let's just go item hunting here.
[24:19.36]We're no longer doing home alone jokes.
[24:23.95]There's some laxative.
[24:25.29]Okay, we got a laxative.
[24:26.33]Look at the toilet.
[24:27.63]The toilet bowl has a very narrow drain.
[24:29.45]Alright, so... We gotta get laxatives into his beer.
[24:33.43]And then fucking saw his legs off.
[24:35.61]Okay, got it.
[24:37.65]I think let's go in the fridge.
[24:38.59]I wanna get a good plan.
[24:39.57]I've got four minutes to plan this out.
[24:42.94]So, beer.
[24:43.58]Do I get to take one?
[24:44.88]Six pack.
[24:45.92]Fridge open.
[24:47.50]Ha!
[24:48.78]An egg.
[24:49.14]The egg in the microwave joke.
[24:50.60]Classic.
[24:53.30]Laxative into beer.
[24:55.28]What can I do when somebody gets in the toilet?
[25:01.53]Blue roll holder.
[25:05.55]Okay, we got toilet paper.
[25:06.77]So toilet paper we're gonna use with... Let me start it here again.
[25:13.88]Alright, so we got, he's gonna use the laxative.
[25:15.62]He comes over angry with the TV.
[25:17.96]Laxative, angry with the TV.
[25:20.47]He's gonna slip and fall on the egg, and then I'm gonna stuff a roll of toilet paper down his throat.
[25:24.61]No, um, I don't know.
[25:27.95]What about the piano?
[25:28.81]Let me look at the piano.
[25:33.43]And he saw the locks off?
[25:37.37]No.
[25:38.02]Oh, Jesus!
[25:41.82]Wow.
[25:42.18]That was close.
[25:43.50]That was really close.
[25:48.72]Can I stuff the egg in the toilet?
[25:49.96]No, I can put the egg in the, uh, in the microwave.
[25:53.90]Is something in the microwave?
[25:57.01]No, yeah, this is to blow the egg up, and then you put the laxative... Alright, let's be conservative with this one.
[26:01.65]We'll get at least, like, a three-person combo.
[26:03.83]Because unless I can't get in anything else, it seems.
[26:11.30]I mean, can I put the egg in the toilet?
[26:21.00]There's a roll of toilet paper going in the toilet.
[26:22.98]Alright.
[26:23.28]So I stuffed... The toilet's not blocked up.
[26:28.18]Laxative.
[26:29.51]Egg.
[26:29.97]Laxative.
[26:30.49]I just don't know how to do this stuff.
[26:31.87]TV.
[26:33.03]So here we go.
[26:33.83]You guys ready?
[26:35.77]Check it.
[26:37.37]TV.
[26:38.79]Laxative in the beer.
[26:40.25]Egg in the microwave.
[26:48.25]Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly!
[26:53.24]Here we go.
[26:53.74]Combos.
[26:59.48]Egg in the microwave.
[27:02.50]He's not coming back, right?
[27:03.52]Good.
[27:03.79]Sits down.
[27:05.45]My accident.
[27:08.27]And then I stand behind the... I have to stand behind something and let it throw, right?
[27:12.27]Alright, now I'm gonna hide in the drawer.
[27:17.83]So we got a combo running up here in about two seconds.
[27:20.01]Come on.
[27:21.89]Alright, here we go.
[27:29.70]Egg.
[27:30.22]He's not happy about that.
[27:31.70]What can I do with the saw?
[27:33.28]Saw the legs off the chair.
[27:34.34]Wait a minute!
[27:37.66]He's gonna run to the bathroom, which means he has to go down here, right?
[27:42.09]Get in there!
[27:45.75]When does he have to take the shit?
[27:50.44]Okay, here we go.
[27:51.66]I'm gonna come up this way because he's definitely gonna go down here, right?
[27:57.55]Wait, is he gonna throw up and shit his pants?
[27:59.17]Alright, let's see what happens.
[28:09.51]Yeah, I got some bonus points, baby!
[28:18.99]This is taking a long time.
[28:20.83]He's putting his hands in it.
[28:21.89]Get your hands out of there, dude.
[28:22.99]That's disgusting.
[28:27.09]No, no, he's coming back here.
[28:31.31]Hop into the kitchen.
[28:33.09]I got 21 seconds.
[28:33.92]Alright, we got it.
[28:38.88]Oh, no, no.
[28:39.42]Come on, come on, come on.
[28:40.28]Hurry up and sit on the chair.
[28:43.47]10 seconds.
[28:45.81]Come on, get in the chair.
[28:48.13]Break the chair and let me win.
[28:51.31]Do it!
[28:53.23]There it is.
[29:04.60]Happy birthday!
[29:07.00]Zero seconds left at the buzzer.
[29:12.57]Sometimes it's necessary to change the neighbor's routine with a trick.
[29:17.32]It's the neighbor's birthday and he celebrates this happy day with his best friend himself.
[29:22.76]He blows out the candles and wishes himself all the best.
[29:27.02]I feel kind of bad.
[29:27.62]This is like, just fuck with the depressed guy.
[29:29.34]You know what I mean?
[29:30.04]Like, this is not cool.
[29:31.80]Now and then he takes a quick peek into his letterbox to see if anyone has sent him a birthday card or maybe even a parcel.
[29:38.43]What a miserable way to spend your birthday.
[29:40.97]Woody decides to pay his neighbor a friendly visit.
[29:46.49]Jesus.
[29:46.85]Alright, well, he's waiting for a delivery.
[29:58.24]We got a picture of Edna.
[29:59.42]Let's get some draws.
[30:03.19]We got a lot of shit here.
[30:06.07]Mouse trap.
[30:07.63]There we go.
[30:08.29]Dynamite.
[30:11.11]I've spent a little too long!
[30:17.60]Why are you hurting us, man?
[30:18.96]I didn't mean to.
[30:20.36]Sorry, we're good.
[30:27.84]Oh yeah, we're obviously gonna put a bomb in the cake.
[30:30.36]It's so fucked up.
[30:31.38]He comes down here.
[30:35.46]He has a different routine this time.
[30:38.34]So let's try to get these all at the same time.
[30:40.54]We got dynamite in the cake, pan on the grandma, step on it and he's gonna get his toe stepped in.
[30:46.17]We got his stuff in the bathroom.
[30:49.09]Let's wait till he just makes his way around.
[30:54.12]No, he's checking that.
[30:55.54]Oh, we can go in the mail.
[30:57.20]Alright.
[30:59.46]We might have to restart this.
[31:00.46]Depends on where he goes.
[31:01.48]Alright, let's go.
[31:04.08]Anything?
[31:07.93]Nope.
[31:09.33]So, wait, we can do mousetrap on the letterbox.
[31:13.47]Blow the candles out.
[31:14.63]Uh, bathroom.
[31:15.23]Let's see if we... Should we make him shit his pants again?
[31:17.33]It's probably an opportunity to.
[31:19.36]No, not this time.
[31:21.12]Toilet?
[31:26.24]Okay, yeah, so wait, we're just going to keep making this guy go to the bathroom?
[31:29.12]Maybe not.
[31:29.55]Uh, I think that's it.
[31:33.07]Examine the soap dish.
[31:36.85]Now we have soap.
[31:37.83]What about putting the soap in the cake?
[31:41.01]He's not watching TV.
[31:42.85]Dynamite in the toilet.
[31:49.47]You ought to blow this guy's toilet.
[31:51.08]This is going to be bad.
[31:51.84]Alright, dynamite in the toilet.
[31:55.78]No, I see that gonna work.
[31:58.82]I mean, I can do that.
[32:00.28]Oh!
[32:06.40]Game crashed.
[32:08.71]No!
[32:10.11]What?
[32:11.47]Hey!
[32:12.37]That's... I think the game fucked up.
[32:18.17]It's alright, restarted.
[32:21.14]I want to get this off my screen, this stupid holo.
[32:27.66]Let me, like... I need to get this off the screen.
[32:30.64]It's driving me crazy.
[32:35.95]Finally.
[32:39.23]Alright, let's do it again.
[32:40.11]Start over, we're gonna do it in the right order.
[32:47.51]I'm amazing... Wait, what do you mean I'm amazing at being bad?
[32:49.93]Am I, like, game locked up?
[32:52.42]How the fuck am I supposed to be bad if the game fucking locks up?
[32:54.96]What are you talking about?
[32:57.91]I had like a game fucking hang-up.
[33:01.19]Come on, I had a teeter hang-ups, okay?
[33:06.84]I had a goddamn teeter hang-ups.
[33:10.46]Fixed my back.
[33:11.48]My spine is now aligned.
[33:12.70]Alright, let's do this.
[33:21.15]Uh, stuff the toilet paper into the toilet.
[33:27.20]By the way, is this fucking loud?
[33:28.56]I can't even tell.
[33:29.26]Okay, he's not going in the living room at all.
[33:34.46]I wonder if, uh, what about the piano?
[33:39.38]No.
[33:39.86]No, nothing with the TV, the chair.
[33:44.71]He's not sitting in the chair at all.
[33:45.81]So we got dynamite, dynamite in the cake, and on grandma, and we're gonna clamp his hands.
[33:49.71]And then what about this box of candles?
[33:52.47]I guess maybe we can fuck with them?
[33:56.73]Oh, shit.
[33:57.59]He doesn't even come in the living room.
[33:58.83]Okay, that's fine.
[34:01.19]Once he goes downstairs, I'm going to examine this.
[34:02.73]Wait, did he just do that?
[34:04.37]Oh, okay.
[34:06.17]I thought he just did it himself.
[34:07.23]Alright, here we go.
[34:10.10]We're going to start to put it in motion now.
[34:13.14]Box of candles.
[34:16.08]Here we go.
[34:16.72]Dynamite the candles.
[34:18.26]We are going to open the fridge up.
[34:22.34]Oh, fuck me.
[34:23.28]I'm an idiot.
[34:24.83]Gun!
[34:25.33]Take out the gun!
[34:27.13]I was like- Um, we got the stupid fucking hourglass back.
[34:42.25]Let's actually do this- We're gonna do this quick, like this.
[34:44.73]Ready?
[34:44.95]Watch this.
[34:47.79]This is gonna happen in a row.
[34:49.96]See if I can get this done so I can go up to the living room.
[34:52.76]Come on.
[34:53.54]Quick, quick, quick, quick.
[34:54.38]Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do
[35:16.60]Does he run to the bathroom to wash his hands?
[35:19.70]This is a lot of time.
[35:20.58]Yeah, he runs in the bathroom.
[35:22.92]Does he run to the bathroom to go take a shit?
[35:26.12]I'm trying to see what the hell he actually does here.
[35:30.17]Does he come up?
[35:33.11]Yeah, he comes back up here.
[35:36.51]So if the toilet paper goes in there?
[35:38.03]That would make some sense, right?
[35:47.23]I need to do three more pranks.
[35:51.31]Yeah, alt-tabbing does not fix the hourglass, unfortunately.
[35:54.03]At least it did.
[35:55.55]Take the soap, yep.
[35:56.31]I'm gonna bomb this cake.
[36:04.44]I don't have enough time to stay in this room.
[36:08.14]So, he's gonna take that, come right back, blow the candles out.
[36:11.26]We're gonna check to see what's in the fridge.
[36:15.96]Curious to see what happens here.
[36:16.99]Alright, here we go.
[36:25.05]Happy birthday.
[36:30.52]Does it do anything about this?
[36:40.88]egg goes in the microwave?
[36:43.10]You're really going to give me another egg in the microwave joke here?
[36:45.62]That'll be four.
[36:47.66]Anything else in here?
[36:51.06]I guess the soap dish, right?
[36:52.98]Let's just go get it.
[36:55.65]Although, can we even get him down here?
[37:00.93]Even with the toilet paper.
[37:04.97]I'm not sure what would make him need to go to the bathroom.
[37:11.25]I'm gonna say soap is, you know, slip on the soap, egg in the microwave.
[37:16.15]And what makes him have to take a shit?
[37:17.15]There's no laxative or anything here.
[37:24.09]Let's give it a try.
[37:31.95]Okay.
[37:34.77]Slip on the soap and fall into the toilet.
[37:40.23]Hang it in the microwave.
[37:42.63]I think that's all we can do.
[37:43.87]This is a way I can make him come back into the toilet, but I don't think there is.
[37:53.40]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, the painting, the painting.
[37:58.70]Do I still have the marker?
[38:00.14]No.
[38:01.14]I can't believe it's 78%.
[38:11.53]he'd go wash his hands maybe he just has to go to the bathroom at some point no he just keeps doing this there's gotta be one more thing to try no there's nothing in there what the fuck dude what oh my god I'm like sitting there just fucking clocked out like where do I go what do I do now at least I know what the fuck god damn it that's so annoying
[38:40.27]I already won the level.
[38:41.35]Alright, so he goes downstairs.
[38:44.91]I couldn't do it anyways.
[38:53.66]So this is what we're going to do.
[38:54.66]Soap dish.
[38:56.52]He's going to get angry at the toilet.
[38:59.79]Toilet paper into the toilet.
[39:02.43]I'm going to turn this down.
[39:05.57]Give me a second.
[39:08.48]I'm gonna bring this down like 45.
[39:09.34]This is like blaring my ears up.
[39:14.76]Finish the toilet.
[39:26.27]Wait, what did I just... I did have a marker.
[39:30.08]Okay, but I already did it.
[39:32.48]Let me just calm down for a second.
[39:33.98]Stop like that.
[39:38.91]So that's where he says he's going.
[39:44.09]Take a deep breath.
[39:47.01]Just blow the guy's cake up.
[39:48.57]So let me do this in order.
[39:50.69]So when he blows the cake up, he goes to wash his hands.
[39:58.52]No.
[39:59.42]The mousetrap.
[40:00.04]The mousetrap makes him wash his hands.
[40:03.00]So we're gonna get the soap, we're gonna drop him in here.
[40:05.92]We're gonna throw, will he get mad at that?
[40:08.62]Or does he just have to pee in the bathroom?
[40:12.96]How much money do I have to pay you to delete this game off your hard drive permanently?
[40:18.97]Nothing, because it's gonna happen like, when I'm done playing the game, it's gone.
[40:22.81]Let's get this done.
[40:27.29]They're not gonna come in here anyways.
[40:30.03]I'm gonna do soap dish in here.
[40:33.92]Toilet paper in toilet.
[40:34.96]Get that over with.
[40:35.68]Get it set up.
[40:39.08]Soap on the ground, right?
[40:40.54]You know, it's like soap on a rope.
[40:41.98]So there's one, two, three, four, five, six egg in the microwave.
[40:49.69]You got it.
[40:51.25]Alright, so he's going to fall down in here.
[40:52.53]It's going to be hilarious.
[40:53.45]Nothing in the medicine cabinet right now.
[40:56.31]Alright, now that he's going to blow the candles out, let's do the mouse trap.
[40:58.95]Let's set it up.
[41:00.87]Happy birthday.
[41:03.31]So then we're gonna draw all over his favorite aunt.
[41:08.49]Takes us in here.
[41:10.87]Lets us set up.
[41:11.55]Plenty of time to set up.
[41:15.24]Let's go ahead and... Bomb!
[41:19.28]In the cake!
[41:21.48]Uh-uh.
[41:21.88]Uh-uh.
[41:22.22]Oh, fuck you.
[41:23.00]Bomb in the... I had this done too.
[41:25.74]There he goes.
[41:27.91]Getting mad at Edna.
[41:29.81]Egg in the microwave.
[41:32.30]And ladies and gentlemen, we have just completed the level and I just have to wait until he's down there and hide in the bathroom.
[41:39.33]It's pretty much just Hitman.
[41:42.73]Slips.
[41:45.74]Angry.
[41:46.50]Check out the toilet.
[41:47.24]I can't believe it.
[41:49.26]It's disgusting.
[41:50.06]Somebody's shit all over here.
[41:53.39]Get it in succession.
[41:54.69]That's gonna be the best.
[42:01.73]The game is fucking loud, too, by the way.
[42:03.53]I just, like, turned it down.
[42:06.23]Get back in there, you fucking bastard!
[42:08.33]Oh my lord, I almost just ruined everything.
[42:11.40]The game was so loud.
[42:12.48]The game was incredibly loud.
[42:19.48]The game was so loud, why did nobody tell me this?
[42:26.84]Now you guys can actually hear me talk.
[42:30.40]Anger, and then happy birthday.
[42:39.02]By the way, there's a second one of these going.
[42:43.20]Because we can change the volume.
[42:44.66]But yeah, it's loud over my voice.
[42:47.13]Oh, 97%.
[42:49.69]Come on.
[43:01.95]Why are my ears so sensitive?
[43:03.09]Because I'm old.
[43:04.91]Alright.
[43:05.59]We're almost done with Season 1.
[43:07.65]Season 2 looks like we really can start introducing violence.
[43:11.87]You understand?
[43:14.37]The apple pie incident.
[43:16.34]Which is the best place to slip up?
[43:17.88]Note, tiles are not only found in bathrooms.
[43:22.12]So I'm talking about the kitchen.
[43:24.76]Oh, delicious apple pie, thinks the neighbor.
[43:27.38]And heats up another piece in his microwave oven.
[43:29.38]Mmm.
[43:30.72]Egg in the microwave, we got that one.
[43:33.79]Still, even when eating apple pie, when nature calls, you've got to answer.
[43:36.77]A little trip to the bathroom is called for.
[43:39.11]And Woody will see to it that this pleasure won't go undisturbed.
[43:44.91]Come on, you're explaining humanity here, like eating shit.
[43:48.46]That's what we do.
[43:50.18]Your entire day revolves around eating and shitting.
[43:57.34]Everything else is an in-between task.
[44:00.37]That's it.
[44:08.20]What?
[44:08.34]He's a maniac.
[44:09.12]What do you mean that's false?
[44:12.26]You eat and then you, you, what do you, what do you, like half of my decisions, like 60% of all my decisions a day are based around when I'm going to go to the bathroom and what I'm going to eat that day.
[44:27.65]what we got to work with we got a some glue that's glue for the uh binoculars no look at the toilet okay takes a while to cook the pie let's just keep grabbing so he is eventually going to come down here after he eats this how long does it take for him to eat it whip cream on the pie alright this guy gets a little respect gets one bite
[44:53.09]And then he immediately... This guy is like an amoeba.
[44:57.57]He just eats and shits.
[44:58.65]It's like a goldfish.
[44:59.51]So what, aftershave?
[45:02.80]Does he shave in there?
[45:03.68]Let's just see what he does.
[45:10.74]Yeah, he shaves.
[45:13.67]Aftershave.
[45:14.21]Put some little deodorant.
[45:15.63]At least this guy's clean.
[45:22.63]So we're going to have to give laxative or something to the pie.
[45:27.71]Alright, let's just keep exploring.
[45:31.29]Color on that.
[45:31.88]I do have the super glue.
[45:37.02]Super glue.
[45:40.44]It keeps freaking me out whenever he walks like that.
[45:45.53]I can't go in the mailbox.
[45:47.57]So, super glue.
[45:48.07]What about super glue on the pie?
[45:48.81]Okay.
[45:52.90]that's like disgusting I would think would be super glue on the toilet let's see what happens if I do that is that what I have to do no super glue on like the aftershave okay so he's gonna super glue aftershave he's coming down here now so I mean we're gonna we're not gonna get a good combo here oh eat my fucking ass alright well at least I know that's what I have to do with that

[46:36.02]Soap dish.
[46:37.12]Can I do anything with the soap dish?
[46:41.03]Soap, alright.
[46:42.87]Medicine cabinet.
[46:44.43]Oh, boy.
[46:45.13]Okay, we got a lot of items here.

[46:50.25]So we have hair restorer.
[46:55.50]Shaving foam hair.
[46:56.70]Can I, like, just poison his food?
[46:59.92]I think I can just poison this dude's food.
[47:01.58]Let's go in the fridge, get the definite guaranteed egg that's gonna be in here.
[47:06.50]Yeah, okay, so, like, poison his food?
[47:15.37]Okay, we changed out the whipped cream.
[47:17.93]He's in there shaving.
[47:18.79]We're gonna make him slip right here.
[47:23.79]Egg in the microwave.
[47:25.09]Egg in the microwave.
[47:28.86]Okay, wait till he comes back.
[47:31.90]Paint on dear old Edna.

[47:42.32]Uh, hair restore.
[47:43.38]Alright, superglue.
[47:49.68]In the aftershave.

[47:51.12]Oh, he gets mad hair.
[47:52.30]Yeah, superglue.
[47:52.92]I don't know what to do with this.
[47:57.80]Hair restore.
[47:58.44]I don't know what to do with this.
[48:00.94]I'm going to hide.
[48:01.36]I'm just going to hide because I don't know what to do.
[48:05.72]Hair restore on aftershave.
[48:07.90]No, on the deodorant.
[48:08.98]Deodorant.
[48:09.66]Quick, quick, quick.
[48:10.40]On the deodorant.
[48:11.65]Come on.
[48:15.44]There it is.
[48:16.04]Alright.
[48:16.72]Season 1 complete.
[48:17.62]Let's just watch it unfold.
[48:18.72]Alright, now let's poison him.
[48:24.98]That is shaving cream on the pie.
[48:26.66]He's gonna get really, really upset stomach.
[48:34.69]What is the point of this?
[48:39.21]Four, five, six, seven, right?
[48:41.61]Am I missing something here?
[48:46.10]Oh, I didn't clog the toilet.
[48:47.67]I didn't clog his toilet.
[48:52.91]Is this a comedy show game?
[48:55.95]I think this actually is a TV show.
[48:59.63]I'm fairly certain of that.
[49:00.71]Yeah, go ahead and shave.
[49:09.08]Super glue.
[49:11.72]Absolutely hilarious.
[49:15.77]Oh, no.
[49:16.25]Wait a minute.
[49:17.02]Oh, wait a minute.
[49:17.56]I don't think I can beat it.
[49:18.28]No.
[49:20.56]No, I can.
[49:21.00]He's gonna come back in here.
[49:26.96]That break is back every time.
[49:32.77]Of course.
[49:34.77]Of course I have to just throw the stupid toilet paper in there.
[49:43.55]Alright, as slow as we go, but you know.
[49:48.33]Just always have to remember, if you're in this part of the house, egg and toilet paper are the same overused gag every time.
[49:55.66]Come on, you can do better than that.
[49:58.40]Just hide.
[49:59.82]Where's the speed up button?
[50:03.58]No, we can't reset.
[50:04.28]We're almost at season two.
[50:07.14]Of this absolutely canceled comedy show that lasted like eight episodes.
[50:14.40]That was the only time you can get him in the bathroom?
[50:15.80]No, he shaves down here.
[50:18.94]He eats pie and then he goes and shaves his face.
[50:22.62]Here we go.
[50:26.34]That really actually is just shit all over the toilet.
[50:31.22]Looking over here, we still have not dropped any frames.
[50:33.99]So that's very, very promising.
[50:42.00]Why fast-forward when you can just change the channel?
[50:47.24]Alright, well, this is it.
[50:49.08]Alright, now we're gonna- look, now we get to see a naked guy, you know?
[50:55.36]Wait, I thought we were at season- no, not quite.
[50:57.94]Wait, can I just play season 2?
[50:59.06]Wait, where even are we?
[51:03.90]Is this a different house?
[51:04.86]Barbecue.
[51:05.32]Let's just skip right to barbecue.
[51:07.82]Give it a try.
[51:11.21]Is this a new house?
[51:12.01]Different house.
[51:12.45]I think it's adding rooms.
[51:15.00]Yeah, it's adding rooms to the house.
[51:16.42]Okay.
[51:21.38]Uh, so I think we just have to do six.
[51:23.92]Nothing in there.
[51:29.71]The plot's not gonna make any sense.
[51:31.39]Yeah, see, we skipped ahead a season.
[51:35.13]You missed the part where he cuts up people in his basement and eats them.
[51:38.17]He's a cannibal.
[51:38.81]That's the part we missed.
[51:45.00]Go in order.
[51:47.46]You think I'm gonna... This was just my can I stream video game.
[51:55.58]There's an attic.
[51:56.26]Yeah, there is.
[51:56.70]This game's elaborate.
[52:02.90]What is it?
[52:03.24]A pig pen?
[52:06.60]There was a pig in there eventually.
[52:07.92]What is over here?
[52:08.46]That was the parrot.
[52:10.08]The parrot's the animal.
[52:11.09]I'm gonna get caught.
[52:13.70]Alright.
[52:16.63]Poison the plant with spray.
[52:21.21]That guy actually does a pretty nice house.
[52:22.48]Is that it?
[52:22.80]Is there anything else here?
[52:23.70]I mean, I am kind of upset.
[52:28.20]Let's just do the shower one so we can see the guy naked and then we move on.
[52:38.59]We skipped the pig episode.
[52:40.41]Only seven minutes left to the stream, guys.
[52:44.59]Alright, we got shoe polish, marker, and glue.
[52:54.72]Shower.
[52:55.26]Alright, so obviously we're putting shoe polish in the tub.
[52:59.68]No, shoe polish in the shampoo?
[53:01.98]Shoe polish on the towel.
[53:03.36]Yep, okay.
[53:06.18]Uh, super glue with, uh, soap?
[53:08.02]Uh-uh.
[53:08.91]No?
[53:09.13]Can we go on the soap?
[53:10.01]When is it?
[53:10.41]When is it?
[53:10.73]He takes the shower now.
[53:11.75]Can I hide in the fucking shower?
[53:13.93]Oh, he's gonna see me.
[53:15.03]It's over.
[53:15.35]I was too busy paying.
[53:19.03]Oh, clog the toilet!
[53:19.91]Alright, that's easy.
[53:24.62]One hour stream.
[53:25.60]No, I'm just kidding.
[53:28.96]We're gonna move on to something else in a minute.
[53:33.59]Let's do this quick.
[53:35.50]I know he's coming down here.
[53:36.44]The parrot's not here yet.
[53:38.74]Clog the toilet.
[53:47.01]Forgot to get everything that was in here, so that's good.
[53:59.81]I clogged the toilet already, and I wasn't prepared for it.
[54:02.81]What is this?
[54:03.63]Milk bottle?
[54:04.91]Glue and milk?
[54:10.76]Never mix milk and glue, guys.
[54:12.10]It's not gonna be good for you.
[54:14.24]We're gonna miss the 9-hit combo here.
[54:17.22]Whatever, I'm gonna just buy some time.
[54:18.52]Because I want to really examine this room up here.
[54:25.85]Alright.
[54:26.25]Glue with the... Milk bottle.
[54:31.41]No.
[54:31.99]Well, definitely putting an egg in the microwave.
[54:34.18]That's guaranteed.
[54:38.24]So what can I not... Piano.
[54:41.74]Here he comes.
[54:44.79]Come with a window?
[54:45.67]No.
[54:49.34]Glue his- glue his esophagus shut.
[54:52.37]That's what somebody just said.
[54:53.61]That's- that's pretty fucked up, man.
[54:57.93]Oh, he's preparing the bath.
[55:04.31]What do I- what do I do with the glue?
[55:05.69]Does he come back in here?
[55:11.71]Glue the piano.
[55:14.77]Uh, there's no access to the piano right now.
[55:18.39]Is he going this way or that way?
[55:19.97]Let's watch him have some fun.
[55:23.01]In the bathtub.
[55:24.11]While I figure out what the hell to do with the glue.
[55:31.11]I can't put that in here.
[55:32.21]I can't switch out the milk with the glue.
[55:35.62]Why?
[55:40.74]No.
[55:40.82]Glue on the fruit.
[55:41.78]Or on the book.
[55:42.22]Alright, there he goes.
[55:50.59]Okay.
[55:53.05]He wasn't, he, apparently that was not even that big of a deal.
[55:56.96]At all.
[55:57.20]Alright, we got sweets.
[56:01.90]What the hell else can I even do?
[56:02.86]Alright, so that's five out of nine.
[56:08.88]What do I do with this shit?
[56:11.80]I don't think there's anything else I can do here.
[56:13.96]Unless it has to do, well, didn't do the toilet paper.
[56:17.45]That's a guaranteed one.
[56:19.67]Something to do with the sweets?
[56:20.53]There is no toilet bowl roller.
[56:27.48]Soap dish.
[56:28.34]Make him slip.
[56:31.84]And we got... Foaming bath pearls.
[56:35.74]And hair restorer.
[56:36.82]Okay.
[56:39.57]Don't you dare get caught.
[56:40.67]Get up there!
[56:42.69]That was... I was angry.
[56:48.35]Get up there!
[56:49.15]Like, Jesus, dude.
[56:50.17]Calm down.
[56:50.73]Alright, he's... There's nothing... Okay, hair foamer here.
[56:54.45]I'm gonna make him slip.
[56:55.17]Uh-uh.
[57:00.90]Uh-uh.
[57:01.06]Uh, why can I not put the hair foamer in here?
[57:02.40]Uh-uh.
[57:05.70]Uh-uh.
[57:08.08]What is... What is... What is he gonna do?
[57:09.84]Give me two minutes.
[57:12.01]Oh, it doesn't just...
[57:18.94]Is he actually going to go shit his pants?
[57:21.32]He is.
[57:22.98]Okay.
[57:28.49]No, no, no, don't lose here.
[57:30.23]This guy's life sucks.
[57:38.15]I feel bad for this guy.
[57:42.46]He really is just living the eat, shit, puke, sleep lifestyle.
[57:47.64]I told you guys.
[57:53.29]Nobody wanted to believe me that this is what people do.
[57:55.76]They eat shit and puke.
[58:02.26]So I cannot use the hair restorer with the milk bottle.
[58:06.12]Why?
[58:06.66]Are you kidding me?
[58:14.44]Which way is he coming?
[58:15.08]This way or the top?
[58:16.05]Up or down?
[58:16.43]I have one minute.
[58:22.30]Hair Restore.
[58:23.01]With what?
[58:24.35]Something in here?
[58:27.73]Towel?
[58:29.75]Empty tub?
[58:30.23]Put hair in the tub?
[58:33.48]Oh, fuck.
[58:33.94]He has to fill the bathtub.
[58:35.08]I don't have time.
[58:36.92]You fill the bath when it's filled with water.
[58:39.86]I'm gonna run out of time.
[58:40.62]I still don't even know what to do with this.
[58:48.75]I might not even get an opportunity to do this because he's going to fill the bath and then run away.
[58:54.09]Shit.
[59:00.74]Reset.
[59:01.72]No, I'm not.
[59:02.42]I can't reset.
[59:03.50]If only this guy was a little bit faster.
[59:11.77]Fill the bath.
[59:13.05]At least let me attempt it.
[59:15.11]No, it's over.
[59:18.15]What are you trying to do in this game?
[59:19.23]You're trying to annoy your neighbor.
[59:22.43]That's it.
[59:22.73]It's a revolutionary video game.
[59:26.67]Uh, I did not win.
[59:30.98]That's okay.
[59:32.54]So, Season 3 is locked.
[59:33.62]That's DLC.
[59:37.78]Alright.
[59:38.60]Well, hey, that game's kind of fun.
[59:40.64]It's called Neighbors from Hell.
[59:44.03]Okay, cool.
[59:45.51]So let's go ahead and play another game.
[59:47.57]This is a new one.
[59:49.61]This is a classic video game.
[59:54.39]This one is coming up here in a second.
[59:59.35]Let me just open it.
[60:01.75]And there it is.
[60:02.37]Okay, it is Neighbors from Hell 2.
[60:08.15]My favorite vacation.
[60:09.56]Alright.
[60:11.08]So, uh, all aboard!
[60:12.82]The neighbor needs a respite from Woody's tricks and books.
[60:16.42]A trip around the world to get away from him.
[60:18.58]Doesn't reckon Woody would follow him all the way on vacation, being a terrifying stalker, to continue to fuck with him.
[60:26.89]And ruin not only his life inside of his own home, but when this sorry bastard gets one opportunity to go on vacation.
[60:38.51]You need coins, I guess.
[60:44.91]Are there other people on this cruise?
[60:51.89]Welcome to the new episode of the Neighbors From Hell Show.
[60:54.77]I'm Joe, the director.
[60:56.82]And in this introductory episode, I'll explain how to play tricks.
[60:59.58]I already know how to do it.
[61:01.38]Move the mouse.
[61:02.86]Very good.
[61:03.34]Yeah.
[61:03.96]Left and right.
[61:04.58]You got it.
[61:04.98]Mm-hmm.
[61:06.50]Find your way to the other side of the screen.
[61:07.72]I get three lives, I guess, in this one.
[61:11.43]Yeah, I can touch this.
[61:13.97]Okay.
[61:15.54]That's a classic item.
[61:16.60]We get a soap in this one.
[61:20.91]Yeah, it follows a routine.
[61:22.19]We got a new character, though, added.
[61:25.27]A couple of new characters.
[61:28.43]Is this this guy's boat?
[61:32.43]You gotta watch his activities.
[61:34.96]Sometimes he will be asleep.
[61:37.94]Okay, so you can't see me when I'm asleep.
[61:47.22]Why do I have to watch this whole thing?
[61:48.42]I know how to play the game.
[61:49.18]This is the second one.
[61:55.56]So we're putting this up there.
[61:56.70]Okay.
[62:03.99]Why?
[62:05.17]Why?
[62:05.61]You stepped in it once, and why would you step in it again?
[62:09.73]You're clearly staring at it.
[62:14.86]Alright, here he comes.
[62:16.20]Come on, get me through the tutorial.
[62:17.97]I just want to, like, have the... The two weird neighbors... Go right to the woman.
[62:27.79]Pre-recorded TV show.
[62:31.13]He's dead.
[62:36.39]Alright.
[62:37.07]What he's rewarded with a gold coin.
[62:38.87]Okie dokie.
[62:45.38]Now we need an item from the vanity bag.
[62:47.06]This actually is not a bad game.
[62:53.38]This really is not a terrible game.
[62:54.73]I can pick locks.
[63:00.11]What do I... Oh, I have to sit here like this.
[63:04.57]It's drunkenly, desperately trying to push me out of the circle.
[63:09.76]I found a knife and a pipe wrench.
[63:13.53]Fellow traveler up there, his name is Olga, is making eyes at.
[63:17.17]Olga poses no threat to Woody, but Woody can disrupt the neighbor's advances.
[63:22.23]And now I'm just, like, now I'm just preventing him from having, like, a girlfriend or something?
[63:28.17]Like, what the fuck is wrong with me?
[63:29.49]Alright, cut the... Cut the sticky tape around the table leg and you'll see what I mean.
[63:37.69]Okay.
[63:40.95]Okay.
[63:42.76]He's being detained in the next room.
[63:46.72]So she can watch me do this and nothing is wrong at all.
[63:49.86]Go to the lower deck and make the neighbors start walking out.
[63:53.20]Here he comes.
[63:59.21]Slipped in the water again.
[64:00.41]Sometimes you just don't have sympathy for somebody when they step in the same puddle five times.
[64:05.17]And they've already fallen down and hit their head on a banister.
[64:09.13]Alright, let's see.
[64:15.65]He's gonna flirt with Olga.
[64:16.69]Thanks to your broken table leg, this flirtation will end badly for the neighbor.
[64:20.09]See for yourself.
[64:22.46]Let's all laugh at him.
[64:23.34]Ahaha, you ruined the vacation.
[64:27.92]And now she's kicking the shit out of you.
[64:30.20]Hahaha, funny.
[64:32.56]Loser.
[64:36.15]It's alright.
[64:36.83]It's alright, his Life is Strange.
[64:40.49]We just went back.
[64:45.34]Can we talk about Life is Strange for a second?
[64:50.36]I want to go over Life is Strange.
[64:52.50]Because it's been out long enough where who cares?
[64:54.62]You guys already know the end of all the stories anyway.
[64:58.87]No, I don't care.
[65:01.05]No?
[65:01.77]No.
[65:02.21]Don't talk about it.
[65:02.83]No.
[65:03.13]Okay.
[65:03.89]Well, all I can say is this.
[65:08.26]You know, play through, play through Life is Strange.
[65:11.76]Cool.
[65:12.88]Okay.
[65:13.85]Life is Strange.
[65:15.09]Um, eh.
[65:15.73]It was like, I didn't hate it, right?
[65:19.21]But they made another game.
[65:21.23]And holy shit, guys.
[65:22.75]When the basis of your entire video game is about how you can control time.
[65:28.08]And you have these mutant superpowers that make interesting scenarios play out.
[65:34.36]When you delete that from the game, the new one is just like walk around as a teenager and talk to people.
[65:42.43]Why they... You can't take away the fucking superpowers.
[65:45.21]What are you doing?
[65:45.81]I can't fucking believe it.
[65:51.94]And the superpower in the new Life is Strange is...
[66:02.25]Like a conversation battle?
[66:04.29]You just have to get the right one to win the con- No, dude, I could put my hand up and... I'll show you.
[66:13.43]Why do I need to show this to you?
[66:21.27]I don't know why you need to see that.
[66:23.53]Yeah, Life is Strange.
[66:24.77]Somebody said it.
[66:25.38]Life is pretty ordinary in the new game.
[66:32.78]The first one could be called Life is Strange.
[66:34.40]The second one is called, like, Life is School.
[66:42.05]Anyways, I forget what we were doing.
[66:45.37]That game sucks.
[66:49.30]I'm sorry.
[66:50.24]If you're, like, a big fan of, like, Life is Strange universe, I'm sorry.
[66:53.60]The first game was pretty fucking cool.
[66:55.62]Second game sucks asshole.
[67:02.65]Like, the second game's fucking terrible.
[67:07.23]You can't take all the superpowers.
[67:08.75]That's why the first game was interesting even in the first place.
[67:16.43]I love that game.
[67:17.35]No, look.
[67:18.41]Alright, we're not going to go off on a tangent here.
[67:25.23]I have a bone to pick with the first game.
[67:27.17]Yeah, there could be bones to pick with that game.
[67:32.10]But let's play it right now.
[67:34.22]Let's play through the whole thing right now.
[67:36.14]That sounds like a good idea.
[67:36.80]What do you think?
[67:39.92]The whole thing?
[67:40.68]Right now?
[67:47.27]Or should we play?
[67:54.37]Come on.
[67:54.55]Come on.
[67:57.61]Uh-oh.
[68:03.02]Uh-oh.
[68:03.52]This is why I want this open.
[68:08.38]Why I want this open.
[68:10.84]You're killing me here.
[68:14.63]Uh... That... Alright, this dead... What are you thinking here?
[68:27.57]Excuse me.
[68:28.05]Oh, no.
[68:34.88]Well, True Crime Streets of LA was supposed to just open.
[68:44.05]But apparently it doesn't want to work right now.
[68:45.63]Give me one second to find out why that is.
[68:47.53]Let's modify it.
[68:50.77]I had to open it in a weird program.
[68:56.50]Remember, it doesn't matter how many times you test something off stream.
[68:59.58]It ain't ever going to work.
[69:02.32]It just ain't ever going to work.
[69:05.50]ever the first time uh and now my whole computer is locked up oh my god give me a break okay there we go um just put on like the uh let me just put on the vrp screen for just a tick here
