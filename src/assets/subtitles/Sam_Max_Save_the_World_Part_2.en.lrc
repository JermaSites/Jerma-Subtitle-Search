[00:01.41]He's one minute early.
[00:03.42]Well, I'm not early.
[00:06.36]As long as it's in this window.
[00:08.90]I could have started about 30 or 40 minutes ago, but I was too busy shitposting in chat.
[00:13.46]It took too long.
[00:14.32]I've been sitting there writing all kinds of dumb shit for 30 minutes.
[00:23.04]So I... I could have started.
[00:25.13]I just had to get coffee and take out Otto and stuff, so...
[00:31.59]I do that to... Okay, those of you that are like, oh, wait, he's been... Why, you know, why doesn't the stream start earlier than that?
[00:37.61]I mean, it's like four.
[00:38.89]It's between three and four.
[00:40.21]What the heck, man?
[00:41.72]No, I... It's because I am here.
[00:43.88]I just like to be a chatter sometimes for like a half an hour.
[00:47.98]It's kind of fun.
[00:49.66]I do it all the time.
[00:52.54]What the heck, man?
[00:56.01]It's because it's different.
[00:58.65]I can, like, hunch over and be like...
[01:02.84]It's a little different.
[01:05.74]Stalling?
[01:06.20]Oh, you're going to get a big stall today because I've got a fucking story for you.
[01:10.05]I'm going to wait until people get the tweet and stuff because this is a big story.
[01:17.82]A big one.
[01:23.80]Stalling.
[01:24.68]Hey, you know, is it a stall if it's... If you... Okay.
[01:29.85]If the car stalls out, I understand.
[01:32.01]But I'm coasting right now.
[01:33.37]I'm idling.
[01:36.25]Stall means the engine turns off.
[01:38.19]Mm-mm.
[01:41.67]A really big show.
[01:43.51]What is that?
[01:45.71]Don't get Bugleberry.
[01:46.62]Fucking Bugleberry.
[01:53.00]But, yeah, today we're gonna- I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
[01:56.50]We are going to do the rest of Season 1 of Sam & Max, probably.
[02:01.32]I don't think, unless somebody can correct me here, I don't think this is gonna take more than six to seven hours.
[02:11.53]Is it?
[02:11.79]Because we're in the middle of Episode 3.
[02:16.97]Three, four, five, six, seven-ish, maybe?
[02:24.22]I'm just going to finish it tonight.
[02:25.52]We're just going to do it.
[02:27.74]Depends on how stupid you feel today.
[02:29.78]I feel pretty intelligent today.
[02:34.28]Anybody else like that?
[02:37.00]How many other people here wake up sometimes and they are Albert Einstein?
[02:44.73]You can do anything.
[02:45.81]You can solve any problem.
[02:48.27]Any solution.
[02:49.53]Any equation.
[02:50.15]You can do anything.
[02:52.45]You're easy to speak, you're easy to talk, you're easy to move around.
[02:55.69]And on some days you wake up and you're like a caveman.
[03:00.82]Seriously, it's 50-50.
[03:01.76]It's yin and yang with me.
[03:08.68]He's trying to brag here again.
[03:12.95]I'm always a caveman.
[03:13.91]Sometimes I'm a caveman for two straight weeks.
[03:18.53]Sometimes I get on it, and I'm just super on top of everything, and I got something to say about that, I got something to say about that, I'm gonna bring up this, gonna bring up that.
[03:26.88]You guys have seen streams before, I'm just like, hey.
[03:30.18]Okay.
[03:32.17]So, um... This way, yep.
[03:35.57]I think, I just died.
[03:36.65]You know what I mean?
[03:39.53]It's yin and yang.
[03:40.43]High energy, low energy.
[03:41.55]That's what that is.
[03:48.85]That's what Yin and Yang is.
[03:50.91]Except it's not.
[03:55.05]Me make funny haha videos.
[03:56.65]Alright, I think we've stalled for enough time.
[03:58.53]I think it's time to tell the story.
[04:01.52]Part 2 of The Dentist.
[04:04.36]And the funny thing about this story is... Wait a minute.
[04:09.16]Wait a minute.
[04:09.48]There's trash over here.
[04:10.24]Hold on.
[04:24.79]Funny thing about this story.
[04:31.06]It's not a... Ow!
[04:41.33]Funny thing about this story.
[04:42.41]It's not trash, I'm moving electronics around.
[04:45.23]It's not trash.
[04:47.45]So the funny thing about this story.
[04:52.73]Come on!
[05:01.36]funny red skin stop it it's why won't this work I'm trying to adjust the white balance
[05:30.51]Look, I live in Las Vegas, it's been hot, the sun's been shining, I got a sunburn.
[05:33.69]Look, see?
[05:34.23]I'll prove it.
[05:35.15]See, look.
[05:36.23]See?
[05:37.33]Look at that.
[05:39.05]See?
[05:42.29]Anyways.
[05:43.96]So, I'm at the dentist today.
[05:49.22]I'm not even gonna look over here.
[05:51.36]I'm minimizing chat.
[05:53.54]That means minimize.
[05:55.21]Alright, so listen.
[05:56.59]Those of you that remember when I said I went to the dentist a couple weeks ago, right?
[06:01.51]So I went to the dentist a couple weeks ago, and I did part one of my procedures that I was going to do.
[06:07.15]Had some x-rays, had some things done.
[06:10.06]Came back for part two today.
[06:12.16]And what did I talk about?
[06:14.90]What was in the dentist two weeks ago that I made a big deal about?
[06:19.48]Uh-huh.
[06:24.18]There was a television in the dentist office.
[06:28.03]No, not teeth, right?
[06:29.59]So in this dentist office, there is a TV with Netflix on it.
[06:32.91]Remember I said, I wonder what people watch when they get their teeth done.
[06:35.90]I made that very specific comment.
[06:40.48]Anyways, today I'm in the dentist office.
[06:42.84]Earlier today, this is like four hours ago.
[06:45.02]So I get the remote and I've got some work to do.
[06:49.89]So I'm going to be there for like an hour or so, right?
[06:52.27]Maybe a little bit more.
[06:53.79]So I go back in the chair and while I'm going back, I'm told, put on whatever you want.
[06:59.51]And I kind of panicked a little bit.
[07:00.81]I didn't know what to put on.
[07:02.33]So I put on something safe, a nature documentary.
[07:08.35]Again, yes.
[07:09.35]I panic to get- I do this every time!
[07:12.99]So I put on a nature documentary and it's the episode- I didn't care what the fucking episode was called.
[07:18.11]The episode was called... Courting.
[07:22.23]It was like a BBC documentary.
[07:23.77]I'm gonna describe it and you may have already seen it.
[07:26.21]So courting is on the screen.
[07:29.11]This is just playing.
[07:30.01]Netflix is just sitting there.
[07:31.43]Thankfully, the volume's not turned up very high at all.
[07:34.20]So I'm in the chair going back.
[07:35.44]Things are normal.
[07:36.80]And I'm glancing over at this TV every now and then.
[07:40.40]Remember, dentist is fucking in my mouth.
[07:43.68]Like, dentist is in my mouth doing these things.
[07:48.42]Dentist is in... Dentist is drilling.
[07:51.44]No, he's not drilling.
[07:54.10]Dentist is using tools inside of my mouth.
[07:57.51]So...
[08:00.85]God damn it, why?
[08:01.89]I've ruined the whole story.
[08:07.47]So the dentist is working in my mouth while the Netflix documentary is playing.
[08:12.42]So he's doing his thing, he's talking, oh yes, let me see this, let me see, turn this way please.
[08:17.92]I glance over at the TV and there are two turtles having sex on the TV.
[08:24.32]Just fucking on screen.
[08:26.84]And I'm like this, and remember the TV's over here, so I really have to like look hard, and there's two turtles just going at it.
[08:33.84]And remember the episode was called The Courting.
[08:37.54]I'm okay, you know?
[08:39.17]It doesn't take, sometimes it's really easy for me to laugh and get into a laughing fit, but whatever, that's fucking nature, it doesn't matter.
[08:45.49]He's sitting there, still doing his thing.
[08:47.21]Okay, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[08:49.81]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:51.15]You okay?
[08:51.60]You okay?
[08:52.18]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:53.16]Uh-huh, uh-huh.
[08:55.46]Little do I know that this keeps going.
[08:58.00]The two turtles are having sex.
[09:00.20]Another turtle.
[09:01.99]Another turtle comes from behind the other turtle and starts punching this turtle in the back of the head over and over again.
[09:11.29]And I'm like... Why?
[09:15.23]Why is it her?
[09:16.23]I'm telling you, this is like CIA-level training that I had to go through here to not laugh while a guy was fucking in my mouth doing things.
[09:25.53]That's not the end of the story.
[09:27.35]So I'm going like this.
[09:30.99]And what do I see again?
[09:32.19]While I fucking peer my eyes down, another turtle shows up.
[09:37.19]Just when I think I was out of the woods here.
[09:39.66]Another fucking turtle starts to fight the rest of the turtles and two of them are having sex with each other.
[09:48.56]It got to a point where I was like,
[09:52.57]And he's like, are you okay?
[09:53.27]I'm like, yeah, I just got some water back here in my mouth.
[09:57.87]This is just animals having sex on the screen behind him.
[09:59.89]He didn't even know.
[10:02.17]This is at the dentist.
[10:04.93]And 20-20 hindsight, I composed myself completely, but holy shit, man.
[10:15.06]It was unbelievable.
[10:19.07]No, he didn't know.
[10:19.89]He's sitting there going like this, and the TV behind him is turtles having sex.
[10:25.91]It was so elaborate.
[10:28.77]Tell him you need to change the channel?
[10:30.01]Well, I... I... You can't... What am I gonna do?
[10:32.58]Uh, hey.
[10:33.72]Hey, excuse me?
[10:35.08]Excuse me.
[10:35.70]Uh... I'm the guy that put on the animals having sex.
[10:39.06]Can I change that?
[10:40.10]I put it on.
[10:49.77]We're gonna play Sam & Max now.
[11:03.07]Speaking of animals... It wasn't that big of a deal until the other turtle started to come and punch the other turtle that was having sex in the head.
[11:16.64]It was just... It was bizarre.
[11:26.76]Nice standup story.
[11:28.38]No, this is just me telling a story.
[11:34.74]I think we're on this one, right?
[11:41.59]That was Larry David.
[11:53.07]I knew that that Netflix shit was gonna fuck me up.
[11:56.72]I was certain.
[11:57.60]When I went there two weeks ago and I saw that the TV was there, I knew there was going to be a problem.
[12:04.58]I've tried to put on something safe.
[12:05.87]And here's the worst part about that.
[12:08.03]I'll end the story and we'll move on.
[12:09.17]But here's the worst part about that entire thing.
[12:11.55]If I had just put on something like Cupcake Wars, I would have cracked and laughed at that show for some reason.
[12:20.33]I was able to keep it together during the animals having sex.
[12:32.36]Life Story Season 1, Episode 5, Courtship.
[12:34.52]There it is.
[12:36.36]That is the exact episode.
[12:37.62]Just watch the part with the turtles.
[12:39.12]You tell me.
[12:39.96]You watch that fucking episode right now.
[12:42.33]Just delete this.
[12:43.39]Get out of the stream.
[12:44.33]Watch that episode right now and you tell me that if you're in the dentist lying in the chair, you're going to have no problem with that one.
[12:59.03]Show it on stream?
[13:00.41]I can't.
[13:01.45]Ah, fuck.
[13:02.15]This is the guy that laughed at fart jokes for an hour?
[13:12.36]Yeah, but... What was I supposed to do with that scenario?
[13:17.99]I don't know, I...
[13:23.96]It's not something that you are expected to see, like glaring, pulling your eyeballs down, looking at a TV.
[13:32.79]Alright, so, now look at, um, don't choose the mating show next time.
[13:38.13]I don't fucking know.
[13:39.74]I'm out of coffee, but I'm so nervous I keep trying to drink it anyway.
[13:43.42]It's funny how stress can reduce you to just a bundle of mindless reflexes.
[13:48.12]Is that what happened to me?
[13:49.56]Wouldn't it be wonderful to think so?
[13:54.05]Do you remember messing up things at the start of the stream?
[13:55.86]What do you mean?
[14:05.93]Alright, well, let me break down what we... This is the... We're in the middle of episode 3.
[14:13.89]So if you're wondering, wait, what the hell's going on?
[14:15.57]Why are you... We just jumped right in.
[14:19.73]It's because this is the middle of the episode.
[14:21.03]We are tasked with doing three things.
[14:22.53]We have to kill Sybil, is one of them, but we're not going to do that.
[14:27.58]That's one of the things we have to do.
[14:29.28]So we have three tasks that we need to fake, I'm assuming, right?
[14:39.43]Have you considered the possibility of staging your own deaths to throw the Toy Mafia off the scent?
[14:44.15]That would be dishonest.
[14:45.19]There's a shitload of turtles.
[14:45.93]It would be a reputation of everything I stand for as a professional witness.
[14:48.61]They just don't stop coming over there.
[14:49.53]They are fighting each other.
[14:50.51]Big chaos?
[14:51.17]Craft?
[14:51.83]Corruption?
[14:52.83]The truth.
[14:54.11]You're a real antique, you know that?
[14:56.27]I mean in a good way.
[14:57.79]I've always liked antiques.
[15:02.95]Okay, so we'll be back.
[15:04.51]We'll be back.
[15:05.49]I know you will.
[15:06.43]You're the only two I can trust.
[15:08.55]Oh, really?
[15:10.15]She should consider Gilt Slinger as her next profession.
[15:14.62]Alright, so, is there- I need to be- I need a reminder of something here.
[15:19.82]We got the teddy bear box here, the thing that can listen.
[15:26.52]The sixth of them, and the narrator, yeah, dude, it was fucking out of control!
[15:31.15]Dude, I keep having flashbacks to that moment.
[15:41.28]Alright, magnet, tokens, use gun.
[15:43.43]I'm not gonna use the gun, we already did that.
[15:44.51]Alright, let's go!
[15:47.83]Is there like a way I can... Oh my god, I did it again!
[15:54.09]It's been like two or three weeks and I tried to leave through the closet again!
[15:57.82]God damn it!
[15:58.18]Look, I had a rough day, alright?
[16:10.84]I will.
[16:11.18]I'm gonna try.
[16:11.76]That actually wasn't rough.
[16:19.83]It was fucking... It was... It was fucking hilarious.
[16:24.31]But you know.
[16:26.60]Hold on, let me move this.
[16:30.44]You guys want face cam today?
[16:46.29]That looks alright.
[16:55.00]I gotta take up some space over here.
[16:56.18]I'm not too big.
[17:05.50]I don't wanna get too... I don't wanna get too big here.
[17:07.26]Okay.
[17:08.84]I need a bigger face.
[17:09.90]A bigger face!
[17:18.71]Alright.
[17:19.69]So.
[17:23.37]I really don't know where we left off here.
[17:25.73]There's the casino.
[17:26.71]This is the casino episode.
[17:29.32]I have some new items.
[17:32.04]Let me go just walk around and talk.
[17:36.20]I have a perfectly symmetrical face.
[17:37.96]I do not.
[17:39.16]I do not.
[17:39.66]Actually, no, I don't.
[17:41.18]I'm going to prove it to you right now.
[17:43.04]So, you see, my face...
[17:46.41]looks like so if we take a look at this angle here my nose comes down it actually goes this way so my nose actually goes in a completely different direction so my nose crosses here my mouth here goes down right so as you see this is the straight out of my face when we turn this way the chin is more pronounced here and the nose points over here right sorry this way
[18:08.75]This eye socket is out a little.
[18:11.13]And when I turn this way, notice how the nose is pointing this way, and this eye socket is back.
[18:17.26]And my chin points down a little deeper this way.
[18:20.82]Some of you have made fun of my face this way because it looks like a banana, and it's very rude and very mean.
[18:26.88]But I think this is my good side.
[18:28.66]This is, I mean, you could, maybe, it depends.
[18:31.13]This could be my good side too.
[18:33.97]You know, the little deeper set eye there.
[18:36.19]They're both good sides, I think.
[18:37.37]They're just both very different.
[18:40.29]You don't have a good side.
[18:43.49]My mother would disagree with you.
[18:57.22]Alright, Sam and Max, where we going?
[18:58.72]No, I do not have a symmetrical face at all.
[19:05.75]I have a very rocky face.
[19:12.08]Are you reading mean comments again?
[19:13.28]Yeah.
[19:16.60]It's alright, though.
[19:19.05]Oh, here's a security camera in here, right?
[19:22.87]So, this is the security camera.
[19:25.17]Can I do anything weird with this?
[19:26.77]Hmm...
[19:44.64]Someone want to give me a little clue here to get us on the right track?
[19:47.06]Because it's been a couple weeks.
[19:48.20]I have no idea what I'm supposed to do right now.
[19:57.33]Will he actually do this for me?
[19:58.31]I don't know, man.
[19:58.75]It's your stream.
[19:59.27]It's been a while.
[20:13.10]Bosco's latest pesky invention is going to be a problem for our teddy bear display project.
[20:17.07]Gotta join the mafia, right.
[20:21.57]That camera seems to be bulletproof.
[20:23.93]If only there were some way to get rid of arbitrary items here in the store.
[20:27.38]Getting rid of items.
[20:29.58]Irony is a sledgehammer, isn't it?
[20:32.36]So do we have to... Okay.
[20:35.85]Shall we shop?
[20:37.11]Let's do.
[20:40.03]I can remove something from here.
[20:49.73]Magnet?
[20:50.15]Or maybe they put the magnet on it?
[20:51.81]Does it fuck it all up?
[20:53.76]Why facecam?
[20:57.00]I'm gonna turn it off in like five minutes anyway.
[20:58.92]Can I distract him?
[21:13.41]What else was... What were the other two tasks?
[21:15.97]Kill Sybil, and then I don't remember what the other two are.
[21:19.62]Is there like a way... Well, I think we're getting a... There's a new character here.
[21:23.14]Okay.
[21:25.18]Hello there.
[21:26.12]What brings you to this neighborhood, Cuddly Bear?
[21:31.40]Not gonna say anything.
[21:32.16]He's watching us.
[21:32.70]You don't exactly blend in too well with the scenery.
[21:36.48]Alright, so... I'd rather keep it to myself.
[21:42.36]Already done.
[21:43.29]Listening device.
[21:45.51]Shoot him, he's suspicious.
[21:46.43]No, he's just gonna follow me around.
[21:50.93]I can't go in here.
[21:51.69]Should I go back to the casino?
[21:54.62]Okay, yeah, you need to, yeah, retrieve the meatball sub.
[22:03.78]Persuade Bosco.
[22:07.29]And kill Sybil.
[22:08.63]Okay.
[22:10.61]So let me go back in here and see if I... knowing that now, let me see if I can... So I have to stop this camera from... hold on.
[22:25.46]Can I put anything on here?
[22:27.18]Let me talk to him again.
[22:36.77]Something that the anti-delivery camera does not recognize.
[22:52.79]It actually is.
[22:53.31]Got it.
[22:53.55]Alright, so he's... Now, okay.
[22:54.35]Now...
[23:19.49]magnet on the camera.
[23:21.42]So I should be able to do something.
[23:23.26]Suck it out.
[23:24.16]Out the door.
[23:24.58]Got that one.
[23:48.84]Alright, so now I have to persuade him.
[23:55.57]Can I put... Wait a minute.
[23:56.57]Hold on.
[23:58.89]He's going to look over and see this.
[23:59.93]He's going to freak out.
[24:00.63]He's going to know that this was deliberate.
[24:04.07]I got him.
[24:04.51]Mm-hmm.
[24:15.82]Oh no!
[24:16.70]Oh no!
[24:17.69]He's coming in!
[24:18.71]We're done for, y'all!
[24:22.89]Persuade!
[24:23.57]I surrender!
[24:29.98]I surrender!
[24:35.20]I told you this would happen!
[24:36.90]I told you he would deliver, and he delivered!
[24:39.78]I can't believe that guy!
[24:41.58]Are you supposed to drink after the dentist?
[24:43.26]We'll help you purge this place of mafia contraband just as soon as we solve this case we're so incredibly busy with.
[24:48.48]Oh yeah, you're real busy.
[24:50.10]You've done nothing but loiter around my store all day.
[24:53.18]What can we say?
[24:54.12]We love to loiter.
[24:55.06]Only water?
[24:55.64]Oh, you mean, uh, ice coffee?
[24:59.80]Not yet.
[25:00.69]Our journey to the dark side has just begun.
[25:02.71]I fucking hate being on camera.
[25:06.79]I'm such a fucking yin and yang on camera.
[25:10.41]I love being on camera, but I hate being watched.
[25:13.69]Does that make any sense?
[25:16.35]I love being on camera.
[25:17.47]I don't like being watched.
[25:22.24]Figure that one out.
[25:22.96]You'll get it.
[25:23.32]Alright, so that's one task done.
[25:28.32]Hey!
[25:35.31]That was loud.
[25:40.52]Just film with the camera turned off.
[25:41.80]Why don't we just put a piece of tape on it?
[25:43.72]Alright, one out of three.
[25:50.65]Now we need to pretend to kill Sibyl.
[26:10.74]What the fuck are you talking about?
[26:12.56]Alright, I gotta... The game audio?
[26:15.80]The game audio's up.
[26:16.48]It's fine.
[26:19.62]Alright, so what else do we have?
[26:20.79]I have... The listening device.
[26:22.87]I'm gonna assume maybe we get Sybil to be like, Ah, don't kill me!
[26:26.81]And then shoot the gun.
[26:29.33]Right?
[26:29.89]To make it sound like, Ah, I'm dead!
[26:32.31]But then she would be a bug.
[26:34.67]Hold on.
[26:45.70]So now, okay, pull out the gun and be like, hey, like... I have to get her to say something.
[27:02.11]Coin?
[27:02.57]Token?
[27:03.03]How do I get her to say... Hmm.
[27:13.22]You seem nervous.
[27:13.92]I'm so nervous.
[27:14.84]Am I more like Sam or am I more like Max?
[27:16.90]What would you guys say?
[27:17.52]The fuck was that?
[27:43.13]Max, I don't know.
[27:44.05]And I know, you know, you know, you know what I'm saying, that's why.
[27:50.61]But no, personality-wise.
[27:55.80]What was that?
[27:56.30]If you don't know what that was, then I'm kind of glad you don't.
[27:58.82]Alright, what about, what else on her Tiki?
[28:12.72]Coffee cup.
[28:16.60]That took it from her.
[28:18.82]Alright.
[28:22.15]What can I do with the coffee cup?
[28:23.81]Hold all my calls, please.
[28:25.27]Hey, keep away from my intercom.
[28:32.05]Can I play with that?
[28:33.53]No, it drives people crazy.
[28:36.35]Put poison in it?
[28:37.17]No.
[28:39.29]I have to put more coffee in it?
[28:42.22]Should I just... You can't kill somebody with coffee, can you?
[28:47.06]You can kill somebody with a coffee pot, but... Why would I poison a coffee mug when the coffee mug could just be used as a weapon?
[28:58.82]Tissue.
[28:59.44]Is this the kind with aloe in the sheets for extra softness?
[29:03.01]Chloroform, actually.
[29:04.83]Some of my therapy patients used to get a little rowdy.
[29:09.09]Too much of anything kills you.
[29:09.97]I'm afraid to touch those.
[29:17.12]I could think of a few things.
[29:22.28]Alright, so I need... I have her coffee mug.
[29:25.51]I need to get her to scream or something.
[29:27.77]Or a voice message of her yelling.
[29:29.93]What do I do with the coffee mug?
[29:36.75]Can I play with this?
[29:38.17]No.
[29:40.15]Why not?
[29:41.73]I'm going to be doing a lot of this, so I'm going to move the camera.
[29:44.97]This is what I do when I play a game like this.
[29:46.41]I'll show you.
[29:51.76]I got my elbow just resting over here.
[29:54.24]This is a good shot, I think.
[29:56.04]With, like, my detached face from my body, like, cocked that way.
[30:01.31]I stopped watching the stream to watch the documentary you talked about.
[30:04.31]Give us a review.
[30:22.24]Turns out I don't like that angle very much at all.
[30:24.00]Going back here.
[30:24.52]So can I put something over that?
[30:26.45]So if they're monitoring what's going on here, how can I pretend to kill her?
[30:51.74]That's what they do in the movie.
[30:56.38]Okay.
[30:56.76]I probably need something else.
[31:05.29]How do I make it look like she was poisoned or killed or dead?
[31:14.23]You can smell me through the face cam today?
[31:17.39]I should smell like dove body spray.
[31:21.34]That's what I use.
[31:22.02]I go underneath both armpits and, like, across the chest once.
[31:28.55]Dove men plus care!
[31:33.67]Clean laundry.
[31:35.19]It's the clean laundry one.
[31:38.77]I smell like clean laundry right now.
[31:41.78]Not like puke.
[31:42.50]Somebody said puke.
[31:43.62]Fuck you.
[31:44.04]Somebody said puke.
[31:48.02]I mean, I did puke earlier.
[31:50.92]But I washed my hands and face and shit.
[31:56.80]I'm gonna go back to the casino.
[32:04.78]What about my office?
[32:05.74]I don't know.
[32:18.07]I still have coins.
[32:21.68]What's the third test?
[32:22.59]Take the meatball sub back from wherever it was.
[32:24.79]Is the meatball sub in, like, my trash can or something?
[32:26.79]I don't know.
[32:36.21]Let's take a look up here.
[32:38.21]I do have a map.
[32:38.70]Show me the money.
[32:40.38]Show me the sandwich.
[32:42.20]Show me the money.
[32:43.90]You show me the sandwich, I'll show you the money.
[32:46.58]I will, I tell you.
[32:47.48]Just show me the money.
[32:49.64]I think we've got a real gun.
[32:51.82]It's a cap gun.
[32:52.26]Don't be scared.
[32:53.22]Trying to fence something hot, Leonard?
[32:55.48]Like a meatball sandwich, Leonard?
[32:57.91]A meatball sandwich, you stone, Leonard?
[33:00.91]You two stay back, or I swear by my mother's bedspread, I'll shoot you both.
[33:11.04]Excuse me.
[33:11.88]Are you by any chance holding us at gunpoint with a harmless cap gun?
[33:15.30]I'm not going to kill us with that thing.
[33:16.46]Always a cheat, eh, Leonard?
[33:18.06]What?
[33:18.88]No.
[33:20.11]Silence Okay, are you gonna tell us where the sandwich is or are we gonna have to get rough I'll never talk.
[33:36.08]Oh, there ain't nothing you can do to break me.
[33:38.52]Nothing.
[33:39.22]Does your mother know what you've become?
[33:41.24]Don't you talk about my mom?
[33:43.35]My mama's a saint.
[33:45.09]Is she the saint of sterno-heated fried food?
[33:47.33]Because if so, she may have another follower.
[33:49.91]Hold on, Max.
[33:51.09]I think we've just found our captive's weak spot.
[33:53.91]Which?
[33:54.53]His uninspired diction or his laughably bad grammar?
[33:57.41]Neither.
[33:57.81]Which?
[33:58.15]I say we hit this cheatin' Slimer septicle where it hurts the most.
[34:02.10]Right in the mother.
[34:03.30]You mean... We're gonna go talk to mom?
[34:04.64]That's right, Max.
[34:05.82]It's time to pull out the yo mama jokes.
[34:09.04]Uh-oh.
[34:10.90]No, not that.
[34:12.68]Anything but that Leonard yo mama's so fat She's so frat not good enough curdled goat's milk on a warm summer day.

[34:55.07]That is a classic Yo Mama joke.
[35:05.38]But there's more.
[35:07.32]She showed up early for her own funeral.
[35:10.17]She knitted a sweater with all her own materials.
[35:12.57]She brings coupons to the Penny Arcade.
[35:14.85]If she fell in nuclear waste, no one would notice.
[35:17.83]What does that have to do with being fat?
[35:21.81]Her mouth would make a long, shorman... This is... I think I have to fix this.
[35:28.15]Okay.
[35:28.25]She has more mold than an origami accordion.
[35:31.05]Oh, it's true.
[35:33.81]It's working.
[35:34.47]Let's keep it up a little, buddy.
[35:35.47]He's got a connector.
[35:36.11]Okay, making grown men weep.
[35:38.25]A fun pastime for the whole family.
[35:40.35]Alright.
[35:43.30]Yo mama so radiant.
[35:46.24]That's a nice thing, though.
[35:47.56]Isn't radiant mean she's glowing and she's wonderful?
[35:50.86]Perky, she's up, she's having fun, she's moving around.
[35:53.45]She's thrifty, she's really quick on her feet and she can steal things easily.
[35:58.37]Yo mama so vulgar.
[35:59.67]Yo mama so vulgar.
[36:04.81]She beat out Sam for best in show.
[36:06.17]Her mouth would make a longshoreman blush.
[36:09.60]That's the right one, right?
[36:11.18]Her mouth would make a longshoreman blush.
[36:13.90]Oh, it hurts.
[36:15.02]It hurts.
[36:16.44]Yes, we're definitely making a dent now.
[36:18.82]Let's keep it up, little buddy.
[36:20.32]Okay.
[36:22.86]Your mom is so punctual.
[36:25.64]Let's take a break.
[36:26.74]No.
[36:27.02]Your mom is so punctual.
[36:30.16]Thrifty.
[36:31.09]Perky.
[36:31.65]Rated.
[36:31.85]These are all good qualities.
[36:36.78]I mean, this one, unless we're talking about in the morning.
[36:39.46]You know what I'm saying?
[36:43.32]It's probably this one.
[36:53.24]She's so thrifty.
[36:55.41]She brings coupons to the Penny Arcade.
[36:59.12]Why is he turning red?
[37:00.40]Oh, he's blushing.
[37:00.96]We've got the same tone here, don't we?
[37:02.92]Now when I see it in real time, I know what you're saying now.
[37:05.34]I just have to see it for myself, you know what I mean?
[37:07.44]Is it the same?
[37:08.74]Oh, whatever.
[37:09.40]Fucking who cares.
[37:30.70]It's the lighting.
[37:32.18]Look.
[37:33.34]I had sun today and yesterday.
[37:36.06]I live in Las Vegas.
[37:37.30]It's like 150 degrees sometimes.
[37:40.08]120 maybe.
[37:42.02]Whatever.
[37:49.75]Radiant.
[37:51.73]Perky.
[37:52.29]Punctual.
[37:53.05]Punctual means you're never late.
[37:58.72]Your mom is so punctual.
[38:00.30]Your mom is so punctual.
[38:03.18]The only time she's low is at a limbo contest.
[38:13.03]She showed up early for her own damn funeral.
[38:15.73]She showed up early for her own funeral.
[38:17.75]Stop.
[38:19.41]Please stop.
[38:21.77]This can all be over if you'll just tell us where the sandwich is.
[38:24.47]This is just... No.
[38:26.54]Let's hit him one more time, Sam.
[38:29.82]Your mom is so perky.
[38:30.82]Your mom is so perky.
[38:38.61]Oh, that's not right.
[38:40.27]She beat out Sam for best in show.
[38:43.41]She knitted a sweater with all her own materials.
[38:48.31]The only time she's low is at a limbo contest.
[38:53.85]The only time she's low is at a limbo contest.
[38:58.08]Oh, okay, okay!
[39:00.90]I'll tell you where the sandwich is, just leave my mom alone!
[39:05.34]Of course, Leonard, we would never do anything to dishonor your dead mother.
[39:10.63]I never even took the sandwich out of the casino.
[39:13.71]I hid it in the prize slot of the one-armed bandit, and then took the one-arm so no one could win it.
[39:18.93]Which brings us to the next question.
[39:21.12]Where's the arm?
[39:22.52]I got it right here.
[39:23.56]Nice shirt bag!
[39:27.01]No, we're gonna keep you tied up and have the rats eat you.
[39:29.01]Yeah, see you in like six days.
[39:30.07]Was that too much?
[39:30.63]That might have been too much.
[39:55.36]I wouldn't leave them there for six days.
[39:56.74]I'd leave them there for, like, a minute.
[39:58.64]And I'd come back and be like, okay, we'll untie you now.
[40:01.06]And send you to the proper authorities to deal with you.
[40:06.93]Yin and yang, guys.
[40:07.61]You get something to do with both.
[40:08.71]It's, like, you know, lawful, and then fucking unlawful.
[40:13.54]They live together.
[40:18.14]Alright, so now I just need to kill Sybil.
[40:20.94]Let's go back to the casino and do this.
[40:25.22]Where are we going, Sam?
[40:28.56]Teddy Bear's Mafia Free Playland... Roffle Good and Roffle Good.
[40:33.54]What would Roffle Good even mean?
[40:37.67]You're not the guy that does anything bad or good, you just laugh at the jokes?
[40:42.85]No, you laugh at clean, good jokes.
[40:44.79]You don't laugh at, like, dirty, mean jokes.
[40:47.61]Roffle Evil would be you laugh at, like, mean shit.
[40:51.49]...where the Mafia plays for free.
[40:55.70]And raffle neutral means you decide between, you know, laughing at, you know, maybe you think something is funny, but you shouldn't, but you still laugh at it.
[41:01.79]Alright, let's go this way.
[41:06.78]Chaotic raffle!
[41:08.56]Chaotic raffle!
[41:09.56]A fucking ASCII art van.
[41:28.92]Why?
[41:30.10]I still don't get it!
[41:36.33]There's only two!
[41:41.50]Shitting Mario and the gnome!
[41:43.86]No other exist!
[41:54.99]I want, like, an ASCII of my face.
[41:57.31]I'd still ban it, but, like, I don't want that.
[41:59.43]What the fuck?
[41:59.81]What the fuck is shitting Mario?
[42:00.65]You don't want to know.
[42:01.31]You do not want to know the answer to that question.
[42:04.23]Wow.
[42:23.89]What is he talking about?
[42:25.93]I can't even explain that.
[42:27.95]My hands are so much bigger than my head.
[42:29.99]Aren't they?
[42:32.65]Alright, now he's gonna kill Sybil.
[42:53.45]The sun has scorched his brain.
[42:56.18]I have the cap gun though.
[42:57.94]Cap gun, coffee, shoot.
[43:00.86]Okay, this is where we're getting some knowledge here.
[43:05.36]Cap gun makes the bang, she falls back and pretends to die, screams, it's all on camera.
[43:15.53]I'm gonna walk up to her, I'm gonna go, listen Sybil, this is what we're gonna do.
[43:18.55]I'm gonna shoot you with this cap gun and then Max is gonna scream in obscenity.
[43:22.36]He's right.
[43:23.02]I will.
[43:25.48]Easy, little buddy.
[43:25.94]It's going to go something like that.
[43:43.68]You crack me up.
[43:44.70]You crack me up, little streamer.
[43:48.98]Alright.
[43:50.16]Listen.
[43:51.05]I've got something for you.
[43:56.19]Just what do you think you're doing?
[43:59.23]Looks like he missed her.
[44:08.52]How do I... I don't understand how do I make her pretend like she's fa-fall- Maybe she's... Can I put something in the coffee and she'd fall?
[44:22.86]I don't- Why wouldn't I just tell her to pretend to fall?
[44:29.00]I'm afraid to touch those.
[44:30.70]Can I put them in something?
[44:33.10]Can I put them in the coffee?
[44:36.60]How do I pick up something like that?
[44:41.51]Stop flexing your shoulders.
[44:44.03]I'm gonna do whatever I want, okay?
[44:47.23]I'm not gonna have you stop me.
[44:51.03]It's the cap gun, but she has to fall down.
[44:57.36]Throw boiling hot coffee at her face.
[44:59.54]Yikes is right.
[45:00.98]Alright, fine.
[45:01.28]Give her coffee?
[45:27.06]Maybe I go to Bosco's and get coffee.
[45:30.08]Give her the coffee.
[45:30.94]Make sure it's not coffee she wants.
[45:33.61]Have her go into a caffeine binge.
[45:38.97]But what's that going to do?
[45:42.41]She's going to clean her house and do all of her taxes early.
[45:45.55]A lot of caffeine?
[45:46.92]What's that going to do to you?
[45:56.23]Your ear looks infected.
[46:02.73]It's probably just hair.
[46:16.12]He's getting redder.
[46:16.98]I'm not getting redder.
[46:17.92]Alright, next time see the word red.
[46:21.08]I'll just ban the word red.
[46:31.62]Hey guys, what color is that coffee pot?
[46:42.14]Why do I have no power here?
[46:45.84]I can't clear the chat.
[46:50.76]How do I have no power in my own stream?
[46:58.41]I have to talk to fucking...
[47:00.42]Dave Twitch about that one.
[47:01.55]What's going on there?
[47:02.31]Alright, I need the coffee.
[47:06.55]Well, what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[47:08.15]Give her a smudgy?
[47:10.97]What's that called?
[47:11.53]A smudgy?
[47:11.77]Put nacho cheese in it?
[47:33.02]I put ketchup in here.
[47:34.62]Does this be blood?
[47:36.04]So I have to shoot the... throw the ketchup all over her and then shoot the cap gun?
[48:00.75]What about the Frieza?
[48:02.43]Was she gonna, like, hold it over and just sludge it on top of her head?
[48:09.29]Let's find out what happens.
[48:19.28]Can you do another bicep curls video to celebrate 225,000 followers?
[48:22.34]Um, I don't think I could lift it.
[48:28.17]I'm not sure I could actually lift it, so no.
[48:37.35]Can you add more space to the side of your head, though?
[48:39.37]Oh, my OCD's killing me.
[48:40.47]Yeah, I'll fix it.
[48:45.58]Wait, did you want more?
[48:46.54]Oh, you're talking about over here.
[48:47.92]I see what you mean.
[48:52.32]There you go.
[48:53.78]Perfect.
[48:56.87]Can you make your head a little wider?
[48:57.93]Yeah.
[48:58.33]Why, is it too thin for you?
[48:59.73]Yeah, I can do that.
[49:12.68]Oh my goodness.
[49:13.68]Thank you.
[49:14.60]I'd lose my head if it wasn't attached.
[49:17.16]That's never stopped me.
[49:19.89]Make it a little bit wider.
[49:21.25]I mean, if that makes you comfortable and happy, I don't want to make, you know.
[49:34.43]She's just drinking the ketchup.
[49:40.44]Dude, can you be- it's not fitting my widescreen TV.
[49:51.79]Oh, fuck, that's right.
[49:52.66]We got 4K televisions now.
[49:54.02]I forgot.
[49:54.50]Sorry, guys.
[49:56.26]I know, I'm just still trying to get the hang of this.
[50:00.62]That should fit the 4K screen, right?
[50:11.32]Hold on.
[50:19.19]Holy shit, look at how fucked up I look.
[50:23.46]This is like Uncanny Valley.
[50:31.19]That's terrifying.
[50:38.13]I look like a fucking lizard.
[50:41.45]Hold on, I need to do this.
[50:44.11]I have to make the one fucking awful joke of the evening.
[50:46.83]Here we go, you ready?
[50:51.38]No, I want to hit him.
[50:53.24]I don't think I can get this done.
[51:00.15]I want to, like, whack him and then have me get goomba crushed.
[51:07.69]Nevermind.
[51:18.11]Can I shoot the coffee cup and have the blood go everywhere?
[51:35.50]What?
[51:36.23]No, that's not how that works.
[51:38.09]What?
[51:41.05]No, I just actually killed her.
[51:42.55]It wouldn't block the bullet.
[51:43.95]I actually killed her.
[51:44.75]It went through the coffee cup and hit her in the chest.
[51:50.15]What?
[52:03.51]You're a real sociopath, Don Bear.
[52:05.87]I mean that as a compliment, naturally.
[52:08.73]Naturally.
[52:12.39]Hey, Sam.
[52:13.12]Webcam tastes like chicken.
[52:14.94]Good idea, John.
[52:16.24]Now those toy mafia goons won't see Sybil wake up, which could be important to our continued good health.
[52:20.74]Well, you won't see her wake up either.
[52:21.90]Then we've learned that webcams go great with ketchup.
[52:25.20]Another fun fact to add to the crime-fighting arsenal.
[52:34.87]Is this right?
[52:35.45]This is longer.
[52:37.67]You know what?
[52:38.49]I think we are.
[52:39.53]Let's go and see Chuckles.
[52:43.95]Sam, Max, you have done what we have asked of you.
[52:47.69]Acts of intelligence, malevolence, and subservience.
[52:51.47]And we welcome you into the ranks of the Orso Nostra.
[52:54.56]Indeed.
[52:55.68]My scum runneth over.
[52:58.08]There's a small ritual with the ceremonial picnic baskets, and then a few other technicalities, and then Joey will show up with some cold cuts.
[53:05.86]But first, as a sign of respect, I will remove my mask.
[53:09.81]Which is good, because I can barely talk to this.
[53:11.69]Who is it?
[53:11.93]What's the reveal?
[53:16.55]That's better.
[53:17.41]Man alive, do I schvitz and that get him.
[53:20.07]Holy fat freak carp on a skewer.
[53:21.93]You're a mole.
[53:22.98]In fact, you must be the one we... I mean, uh, does the carpet match the drapes?
[53:28.61]the code phrase idiot these guys are freelance police apparently they still haven't figured out that I've switched sides he's right max we still haven't realized that wait so I get that the mole turned traitor presumably for the wealth and power that the toy mafia could offer but what happened to the previous teddy bear or teddy bear what happened well we know the original teddy bear on his own meatball sandwich back in 65. yes good point
[53:56.94]Should we run now?
[53:58.08]Perhaps so.
[53:58.52]Get them!
[53:59.36]Head for the car, buddy.
[54:01.34]Man, this is fucked up.
[54:06.04]There we go.
[54:06.48]That's better.
[54:09.12]Is that episode three?
[54:11.62]Oh!
[54:13.68]Sam, I couldn't help but notice that a number of bloodthirsty gangsters are right on our tail.
[54:18.12]Eat lead, coppers.
[54:20.37]Yes, I saw that.
[54:21.89]He's trying to shoot their tire.
[54:24.13]I can't shoot behind me?
[54:25.76]Alright, put him away then.
[54:27.66]Put the gun away.
[54:51.46]No, sit down.
[54:52.82]Sit down.
[54:53.30]No, sit down!
[55:01.93]Can I drop something on him?
[55:08.75]Wait, hold on, hold on, I think I got it.
[55:14.25]Don't worry, they're using a cap gun, we'll be fine.
[55:17.31]One, two, three!
[55:22.96]That guy's dead.
[55:24.50]That guy's dead.
[55:27.12]Let's go take down that fat little fraud once and for all.
[55:30.53]Good idea.
[55:31.33]Hold on, little buddy.
[55:39.84]Hmm.
[55:39.98]Find out just what that traitorous mole there is doing.
[55:42.34]Well, now that we have free reign to look at stuff, let's go look at the chalkboard.
[56:10.20]This gobbledygook's best left to the freelance accountants.
[56:14.28]Racketeering.
[56:14.96]Extortion.
[56:17.03]Smuggling.
[56:18.25]Smuggling.
[56:19.63]I'm not much of a fighter.
[56:21.79]I did that yesterday.
[56:22.49]I can't do that twice.
[56:23.73]I'm not allowed to do that twice in two days.
[56:40.91]Yesterday's was better.
[56:44.91]Hey, there's a whole bear-making factory back here.
[56:47.78]You mean the respectable propriety of a gambling casino is just a front for the shadowy underworld of labor and industry?
[56:53.75]I'm scandalized!
[56:59.94]Come no closer.
[57:01.38]I know how to use both of these.
[57:02.90]Was one of those a grenade?
[57:03.90]I'll be honest, we're probably more worried about the gun.
[57:07.40]Indeed.
[57:08.54]More fool you, then.
[57:10.48]This Hypno-Bear will make you my willing slaves.
[57:14.37]You can do the factory work now that you've rid me of my inept underlings.
[57:19.35]Look!
[57:20.23]Look at the Hypno-Bear!
[57:21.43]Don't you feel sleepy?
[57:25.64]Don't we?
[57:28.98]We don't.
[57:29.78]Hypnosis won't work on either of us.
[57:31.74]But play along until we get that gun from it.
[57:34.30]I asked you a question, slaves!
[57:37.08]Yes, master.
[57:38.79]Yeah.
[57:39.65]I feel kind of tired a little bit, for some reason.
[57:42.13]What he said.
[57:44.45]Really?
[57:44.85]It seems a little off somehow.
[57:47.97]Maybe it's just me.
[57:49.18]Oh, I know.
[57:50.72]Here's a test.
[57:51.78]Tall one, you shoot the short one.
[57:54.10]Oh, he's not... There's nobody else in the room.
[57:56.36]Cap gun!
[57:56.60]Real gun.
[58:15.44]Mother of mercy, is this the end of little Maxie?
[58:19.11]Oh, death, where is that guy, Sting?
[58:23.33]The pain, the pain, and only two days to retirement.
[58:27.25]You gotta promise.
[58:29.32]Teemo, the duke's a hazard for me.
[58:32.52]Pretty good Bugs Bunny death scene.
[58:34.22]So cowards die a thousand deaths.
[58:37.00]Well, heroes die but once.
[58:38.86]Unless they're playing video games, in which case heroes die a lot too.
[58:42.06]So good night, fresh prince.
[58:44.43]And may Charlie's angels sing thee to thy rest.
[58:48.67]Right, well... So cold.
[58:51.29]Why am I so cold?
[59:06.82]He's gonna break the machine?
[59:07.86]Don't do that!
[59:08.88]You're gonna break it!
[59:13.42]Eh, we shouldn't be breaking that machine.
[59:14.74]We can use that to produce grain or something somewhere.
[59:17.57]Okay.
[59:18.45]Good job, slave.
[59:19.77]Just about ready to have you shoot him again.
[59:22.45]Yes, master.
[59:24.88]Now, you run the factory while I read the paper.
[59:28.81]Just get the hypnobare sorted for delivery.
[59:30.87]But I didn't do anything.
[59:31.39]I'll take them around later.
[59:32.67]Yes, master.
[59:33.87]Good, good.
[59:35.11]I don't understand.
[59:35.75]Now I'm off to see what wry observation Fred Massett has for us today.
[59:43.30]Max, you keep playing dead.
[59:45.02]I'll figure out some way to bring Teddy Bear and his factory to their respective needs.
[59:49.44]I can't hear you.
[59:50.26]I'm dead.
[59:54.29]Alright, so, um... We could have just arrested him.
[59:58.11]Why don't we just arrest him right now?
[60:13.46]They're still producing these.
[60:14.46]Halt!
[60:14.88]Halt the production!
[60:15.78]What do I got in here?
[60:19.80]I have a token.
[60:23.49]Nefarious.
[60:30.67]Alright, so, um... What do we got over here?
[60:40.98]One-armed bandit machine in development.
[60:43.07]Screwdriver.
[60:53.25]Menacing computer, which means nothing.
[61:03.67]Why not?
[61:04.29]Why not?
[61:04.53]Just try!
[61:04.75]I did it in VR, it's not hard.
[61:07.48]What about, like, here?
[61:07.98]What about that hopper over there?
[61:22.53]I think these are the voice gizmos for the insidious hypnotic bears.
[61:27.35]The voice gizmos?
[61:30.70]Um... I really don't wanna screw that.
[61:35.44]Do I have to change them with the voice bug?
[61:40.32]The voice bug's still sitting on Sybil's desk.
[61:42.40]I can't leave.
[61:43.06]Master.
[61:47.13]What is it, hypnotic slave?
[61:49.21]Something wrong with the machine?
[61:51.31]No.
[61:52.71]You don't have to pretend anymore!
[62:05.59]You have a real gun!
[62:06.64]Alright, what about the screwdriver on the one-armed bandit?
[62:10.64]Can I, like, twist it off, do something with it?
[62:13.08]Okay.
[62:22.33]Oh, there it is.
[62:24.26]You're on fire.
[62:36.89]It'll pick this one up.
[62:37.75]So what does that do?
[62:38.69]You're on fire.
[62:54.30]Wait, is he also hypnotized?
[62:56.46]A lot of hypnotism in this game.
[62:59.04]Aw, isn't that cute.
[63:03.12]Let's go tell him he's on fire.
[63:07.05]I know she's married now, but that Kathy is still smoking hot.
[63:11.11]This game is fucking weird.
[63:13.17]What is it now, slave?
[63:14.91]You're on fire.
[63:20.12]I'm on fire!
[63:21.38]Help!
[63:21.96]Help!
[63:22.66]I'm on fire!
[63:23.34]I'm on
[63:24.75]Not real extinguisher.
[63:26.89]Sorry, pal.
[63:29.45]Ow!
[63:29.57]I'm on fire!
[63:30.33]I'm on fire!
[63:35.32]That would be unchivalrous.
[63:36.90]Anyone?
[63:38.22]When he's not paying attention?
[63:39.28]It's not working!
[63:41.74]Why isn't it working?
[63:44.25]Alright, Max, get up.
[63:44.85]Let's go.
[63:45.85]You okay, little buddy?
[63:47.35]I could use a mattress.
[63:52.36]Alright, alright.
[63:52.90]Oh, wait, no, he can be... I can do this.
[63:55.88]He'll get zoinked up and dragged over.
[63:59.16]Is he too big for this?
[64:22.55]Oh no!
[64:24.31]He's clogging up the chocolate vent!
[64:29.67]The whole thing has been contaminated!
[64:31.43]We have to replace all that chocolate!
[64:34.64]Can he get this?
[64:37.64]Can he get this?
[64:38.90]He gets it, then he goes... Then he goes... He gets it, then he goes... Then he goes... Then he goes...
[64:52.18]put like 5,000 pounds per square inch of air underneath them and shoot them out.
[64:56.84]Wait, what?
[65:04.83]That's what I call breaking the bank.
[65:06.63]And the sidewalk, and the water main, and the buffet table.
[65:10.07]You're really broken up about that buffet table, aren't you, Max?
[65:13.35]It was the only innocent in this whole affair, Sam.
[65:16.39]I mean, apart from the bystanders and their pets.
[65:18.87]Buck up, little pal.
[65:20.05]Maybe the commissioner will tell you something.
[65:21.35]How many people were in that factory?
[65:22.53]...at Squirrel Garden when we tell him how we cracked the case.
[65:25.53]He better.
[65:26.50]For all the hard work I did, I want two, no, three jellied lemurs with extra salt.
[65:32.12]So we just killed everybody.
[65:38.64]And here is the protagonist, no, the antagonist of the next one.
[65:54.90]He hits his head backwards at the camera.
[65:56.26]What the fuck, man?
[65:59.00]The mole, the mop, and the meatball.
[66:00.02]That one's done.
[66:04.28]A nice mouth close-up.
[66:05.53]They don't do those anymore.
[66:14.32]Took you long enough.
[66:15.14]Let's do the next one, episode four.
[66:29.93]Ted E. Bear.
[66:35.14]Now wait a week before I play episode four.
[66:37.02]Well, I also took a week off.
[66:47.98]Chuggy cheese.
[66:55.43]Why am I so red?
[67:01.51]Game tap!
[67:03.09]I've told you guys that story about game tap, right?
[67:04.81]I think I already have.
[67:07.87]Have I?
[67:08.25]I have.
[67:08.60]I know I have.
[67:11.36]A bug just touched me.
[67:15.86]I've never told that story?
[67:17.07]I've not told the GameTap story.
[67:23.44]I swear to god I have.
[67:28.33]Well, while I get this, um, alright.
[67:30.81]Let me refresh your memory.
[67:33.47]So GameTap was a service.
[67:35.31]It was actually way before its time.
[67:37.25]It was a service where you paid a monthly fee, and you got access to a bunch of games.
[67:43.15]Some of them were retro games, some of them were Genesis games, Super Nintendo, right?
[67:48.43]They had a whole catalog of stuff.
[67:50.05]And they had new stuff come out too.
[67:51.83]Some maybe a couple years older, but it was like a Steam, but it was streamlined through the GameTap app.
[67:57.51]It was actually really cool.
[67:59.31]So I got it for a while.
[68:01.43]I was on it for a while.
[68:03.10]And after maybe two, three, four months, I decided I didn't want it anymore.
[68:07.02]It was like, I didn't really like the... They weren't coming out with anything that I really cared that much about.
[68:12.07]I played all the back catalog of their retro games, and I kind of was done with it.
[68:16.15]So I called up to cancel it.
[68:18.62]And I got on the phone, and I got to the cancellation, you know, the sales department.
[68:22.50]Yeah, you have to do the shit by phone.
[68:24.32]Because remember, this is like fucking 15 years ago.
[68:26.22]This is like at least 10 to 15 years ago.
[68:28.38]And the person on the phone told me, Oh, that's unfortunate.
[68:31.83]You want to leave the service.
[68:34.01]Well, what if I, you know, maybe get a little more chance.
[68:38.35]What if I gave you a free month to game tap?
[68:40.01]I was like,
[68:43.96]Um, yeah, okay, fine, I guess so, I don't have to pay for this month.
[68:50.13]No, no, free month of GameTap.
[68:52.27]He had that voice too, I swear to God.
[68:53.85]So I got a free month of GameTap and I continued to play and didn't really, I wasn't playing it that much, so at the end of that month, another 30 days went by, I called again to cancel.
[69:03.19]And it was another person, and I told them I wanted to cancel, and they said, you could probably guess,
[69:12.16]Oh, but you know, I know you want to leave, but what if you got a free month of GameTap, the service for free?
[69:20.82]And I'm like, okay.
[69:24.28]Okay, sure, I guess I'll have it again in another free month.
[69:27.53]This happened two more times.
[69:29.89]After the fourth month, I was just like, you know what?
[69:34.41]I don't really want this anymore.
[69:36.73]I don't want GameTap anymore.
[69:42.10]I tried to cancel it more than three times.
[69:46.37]I didn't even want it for free.
[69:48.03]No, I didn't.
[69:48.65]After like two months, three months, it was just like, I don't use it.
[69:54.17]I don't want this.
[70:00.66]You could probably still have GameTap to this day.
[70:02.72]Yeah, but I feel like I've told that story before.
[70:06.47]I wonder what would have happened if I kept calling to cancel.
[70:08.85]Would they have just kept, would they have just given me free months forever?
[70:14.59]Did GameTap go out of business?
[70:15.89]It did.
[70:17.25]Long time ago, GameTap went out of business, like, not that much further after it came out, which you probably could understand that if they were just giving free months to people that tried to cancel.
[70:29.02]I think their theory, look, and here's the theory, right?
[70:32.42]If you have a credit card that's linked up to something like Netflix,
[70:36.16]you don't really think about that payment.
[70:38.11]It just kind of happens.
[70:39.97]And if you were given a free month of Netflix and you're like, Oh, okay, I guess if I like my credit card, well, I guess stay linked.
[70:46.51]Right?
[70:47.61]So then after a month, you just don't even think about it and you just keep getting charged.
[70:53.99]You just kind of forget about it.
[70:55.09]Right?
[70:58.39]And the companies use that kind of the pro maybe that process of customer retention
[71:04.49]Over the long term, the person will forget that they even cared about it in the first place, and their $12 a month will just still come out forever.
[71:14.22]But I would call every month, and I would put it to the day to make sure.
[71:19.38]Because I was still having fun with GameTap, so I didn't like it.
[71:22.26]After three months, I didn't care that much about it, but I was still doing it every so often.
[71:29.61]If you just stopped streaming, imagine how much money you would make.
[71:35.54]You know, let me open up the new one.
[71:36.80]You know, the interesting thing about that is I... Oh, let me just save this just in case for some weird reason.
[71:48.21]Oh, I can't.
[71:50.89]I can't imagine.
[71:51.89]I've thought about that once or twice.
[71:53.13]Like, if I just stopped streaming, right, completely, how many people would still just be paying here over the years?
[72:03.36]You know what I mean?
[72:03.92]Like, it's...
[72:06.38]That's weird to think about that.
[72:11.28]If we call you, we would get a free subscription.
[72:14.34]I don't have the power to do that.
[72:18.52]Eventually Twitch takes your button away.
[72:21.67]That's true, but I wonder just how people kind of just forget.
[72:26.62]That they're connected to it and they subscribe to it.
[72:31.36]It's just an interesting thought experiment to think about.
[72:35.36]I wonder if I just stopped streaming today, what would happen?
[72:39.57]How many subscribers would I have in like two years?
[72:46.31]I have a complaint.
[72:47.83]Hold on, I gotta... Oh yeah, I forgot.
[72:50.86]I have to watch.
[72:51.44]I gotta take this out.
[72:52.16]It's gonna be really loud.
[72:54.92]I can't...
[72:56.86]There we go.
[72:57.40]I can.
[73:05.64]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[73:16.85]There it is.
[73:17.23]This is episode four.
[73:17.91]This is called Abe Lincoln Must Die.
[73:20.09]It's an interesting title.
[73:33.12]Wait, I'm gonna have to change this again.
[73:34.20]It's gonna be kind of loud because I can't turn it down yet.
[73:39.64]That was Max's aunt.
[73:59.98]No.
[74:00.78]Yes?
[74:01.38]Sweet suffering Saint Sebastian on a sousaphone and a short story by Susan Sontag.
[74:05.46]We're on our way.
[74:06.26]Let me guess.
[74:07.78]Our friendly neighborhood demon just burnt down another monastery.
[74:10.96]No, Max.
[74:11.60]We have a far more bloodthirsty adversary this time.
[74:15.16]The President of the United States of America.
[74:18.54]Who?
[74:19.28]The man's gone nuts.
[74:20.65]He's enacting all kinds of crazy new laws.
[74:23.35]Aiden.
[74:23.49]Here comes a politics stream.
[75:02.91]Why is Abraham Lincoln president here?
[75:05.09]It's weird.
[75:06.03]Alright.
[75:21.89]Alright, hold on.
[75:24.31]I gotta resize some windows here.
[75:27.39]I gotta resize somebody's windows.
[75:32.42]I have to point out, Sam, that we could have avoided this gruesome accident if you just let me dry.
[75:37.08]And I have to point out that we could have avoided this gruesome accident if you hadn't jumped on my head shouting, Jersey Devil, Jersey Devil, and firing your gun out the window.
[75:44.78]I swear, that woman was a Dead Ringer for him.
[75:47.87]Well, here we are, standing in an open field west of the White House.
[75:51.53]Why does the White House have a front door?
[75:52.59]Alright, hold on.
[76:00.27]I mean, I know the White House has a front door, but why does it look like a hotel?
[76:03.07]That's a little bit better.
[76:08.88]Okay, here we go.
[76:29.62]Now comes, like, the clown music.
[76:39.78]Every single one of these is... You have to re- reopen it.
[76:43.15]I'm gonna stretch it.
[76:47.55]I'd like to stretch it out a little, so there's not so much space.
[76:50.23]You know what I'm saying?
[76:53.79]That's okay.
[76:55.62]Alright, here we go.
[76:56.96]This is called, um, Abe Lincoln.
[76:59.68]Let's, let's just save it here, just to have one.
[77:02.24]And, alright, so we... Please do not feed the submarine.
[77:06.02]Hey, my missing boxing glove!
[77:10.46]It's always in the last place you look.
[77:15.40]Oh, okay, what is that?
[77:16.06]I got a boxing glove.
[77:17.51]The White House pool.
[77:18.81]Most secure wading pool on Earth.
[77:25.24]I need to like... I move around too much, that's why this happens.
[77:40.38]Alright, I'm ready.
[77:42.79]Jimmy Two-Teeth.
[77:43.63]Who's Jimmy Two-Teeth?
[77:45.47]Jimmy?
[77:46.43]Oh, great.
[77:47.27]What are you guys doing here?
[77:49.07]Oh, just saving the world.
[77:50.76]What are you doing here?
[77:52.18]I happen to take my vacations at the White House, and I need a little R&R.
[77:56.72]Speaking of which, beat it.
[78:01.12]Whee!
[78:02.00]Okay, that's startling.
[78:03.56]Alright, anything else?
[78:05.94]There's a golf course over here.
[78:07.24]Number nine.
[78:11.78]Any golf balls?
[78:13.24]Nope.
[78:15.27]What about, can I drop a listening device inside of that hole and then be able to hear the conversations that they have while they're playing golf?
[78:26.31]There is a small mailbox here.
[78:28.61]Aw, it's one of those ornamental mailboxes that doesn't actually open.
[78:32.64]That's government efficiency for you.
[78:35.18]Aw, it's fuckin' government.
[78:36.68]Aw, it's fuckin' government.
[78:39.10]Alright, sign, what's it say?
[78:41.08]On the White House?
[78:52.30]Alright, Secret Service.

[79:38.97]Protects the president.
[79:39.88]That's my cousin talking.

[79:54.44]Oh, I gotta change the game.
[79:55.73]Here to save the president.
[79:56.73]I thought we were here to stop the president by any means necessary.
[79:59.93]I was going to wait to mention that part, Max.
[80:02.09]Either way, sir, you can't get inside.
[80:03.95]Orders.
[80:05.71]Episode four.
[80:08.33]What's this?
[80:09.17]Yeah, I gotta get the right one.
[80:12.69]There it is.
[80:13.85]So people know we're playing the correct game here.
[80:17.49]You know what I'm saying?
[80:21.21]Give me one second.

[80:27.86]That should be good.
[80:32.62]He's googling answers that fast?
[80:36.35]Alright, we'll be back.
[80:37.19]We gotta get away, find a way inside the door.
[80:38.91]Alright, so let's go...
[80:56.33]Post no bills.
[80:57.38]A little bit of Payphone.
[80:58.94]Can I call?
[80:59.50]Nice stool.
[81:01.16]It looks a little like a weird space creature, poised to devour the unwary mortal foolish enough to sit on it.
[81:07.60]I like that in a stool.
[81:09.10]A stool?
[81:10.36]Suspect yourself.
[81:11.88]That's so Madonna.
[81:14.67]Payphone.
[81:15.09]Hey, this phone only takes Susan B. Anthony dollars.
[81:17.75]It must be one of those stupid 555 phones.
[81:20.79]Yes, actually.
[81:21.55]555-1984.
[81:24.47]Hey Sam, did I ever mention how I've memorized pi to 1,000 decimal places?
[81:29.04]It's 3.14159265358979- Man, do you have a piece of paper handy?
[81:34.64]Not even true.
[81:34.94]Do you want to write down the phone number?
[81:36.94]I remember the number.
[81:37.86]I want to write myself a reminder to smother you with a pillow in your sleep.
[81:43.50]Well, that's a threat.
[81:44.30]Okay, so, uh, alright.
[81:50.60]$2 for valet parking.
[81:54.23]Anything else over here?
[81:58.93]Sam's getting fed up.
[82:01.12]Kind of.
[82:01.44]Alright, presidential storage.
[82:03.52]Can we go in this door?
[82:05.96]Hmm.
[82:06.66]White paint, Christmas lights, and a small barbecue.
[82:10.54]Everything somebody would need to renovate, decorate, and then accidentally burn the place to the ground.
[82:15.82]Later, Max.
[82:16.46]Later.
[82:16.72]Alright, punch through door with boxing.
[82:20.44]There are so many other things to punch.
[82:24.13]OK, so we're going to listening device on agent.
[82:28.84]Get him to give us the go ahead.
[82:37.65]Can I get him to say something over the phone?
[82:43.93]I want to talk to your manager.
[82:45.47]No can do, Sir.
[82:46.51]He's with the president.
[82:49.18]Don't you get bored guarding this door?
[82:51.02]It's a rewarding job, sir.
[82:52.50]Doing my part.
[82:53.46]Keeping the president safe.
[82:54.86]Hey, Superball!
[82:56.00]I'd like you to smell these two handkerchiefs and tell me which one smells more like chloroform.
[83:00.26]Not now, Max.
[83:00.96]Alright.
[83:05.85]I've had enough of this.
[83:08.35]Well, give him back.
[83:11.95]Okay, here's what he said.
[83:13.85]Just step away from the door, please.
[83:15.49]Yes, sir, that is all I say.
[83:17.21]Thank you, sir.
[83:20.31]That's what he said.
[83:20.97]He said more than that.
[83:26.17]Jimmy, two teeth.
[83:26.95]Can you help me?
[83:30.76]Jimmy, I could just drop a cinder block on you right now.
[83:35.14]Remember that.
[83:43.13]Dad, look what we did.
[83:52.56]Was that supposed to be a threat?
[83:56.72]Alright.
[83:58.62]I kind of need to put this on screen.
[84:12.83]That's not even a banana.
[84:14.03]Dude, that's the top half of the banana.
[84:17.03]You need the whole thing.
[84:19.41]You need my mouth to be at the very bottom.
[84:22.09]Thin.
[84:25.30]That's actually a really high-fidelity image, though.
[84:32.25]That's a high-quality image.
[84:38.79]But that's kind of a... That's kind of not a banana.
[84:45.24]That's a sexy banana.

[85:18.37]Oh, I can leave.
[85:19.75]Alright, let's go back to the office.
[85:21.83]For a second, I thought I had to stay there.
[85:35.10]Why am I wearing lipstick?
[85:36.38]I'm not wearing lipstick.
[85:37.54]I'm just full of blood.
[85:40.78]I have extra blood.
[85:47.14]I have a lot of blood.
[85:49.48]You know, humans have four pints.
[85:50.96]I have like five pints of blood.
[85:52.76]It has to go somewhere.
[85:56.14]I have a really red mouth.
[85:58.94]Red cheeks.
[86:00.48]Red... chest.
[86:04.77]Red ha- look at my hands.
[86:08.51]Red... I'm red.
[86:10.83]Only sometimes though.
[86:11.65]Sometimes I'm not full of blood.
[86:12.69]Sometimes I have like a really pale complexion.
[86:15.47]Yin and yang.
[86:17.41]Some blood.
[86:18.05]No blood.
[86:19.27]Less blood.
[86:23.79]He's gone.
[86:24.35]Can I do anything?
[86:28.25]Because he's not here.
[86:29.07]Can I do something here?
[86:29.77]Alright, what about... What else is here?
[86:32.65]Oh.
[86:32.79]Oh yeah, that's right.
[86:34.90]It's not even real.
[86:46.29]I got a lot of collagen in my face.
[86:47.71]Would you like me to show you what I mean by that?
[86:49.79]Warning.
[86:50.01]This is gonna be disgusting to some of you.
[87:06.42]Why is he up here?
[87:06.92]He really has been in here for like six days.
[87:08.30]Show the collagen.
[87:22.70]So collagen is your elasticity of your face.
[87:26.16]It keeps your skin up.
[87:27.92]That's when you lose collagen.
[87:29.02]That's how you start to get droopy and you get wrinkles.
[87:31.48]And I've got a lot of collagen.
[87:32.48]That's why I'm so red.
[87:34.71]But I'm able to do things like this.
[87:36.21]No, I'm not going to do it.
[87:40.47]If I get 5,000 subs, I'll do it.
[87:44.35]I'm going to do it now because I don't want that to happen.
[87:48.47]See?
[87:49.69]Look at this.
[87:53.07]I got really springy skin.
[87:59.33]I'm like a rubber band man.
[88:05.99]He's wearing a mask!
[88:07.55]I just like peel it off and I'm another person.
[88:09.59]It has nothing to do with collagen.
[88:17.35]What are you talking about?
[88:18.13]I've got fucking rubber band collagen skin!
[88:22.78]Like, look at... No.
[88:28.46]A streamer is no one.
[88:31.50]Who are you?
[88:34.54]No one.
[88:42.31]He took a bite of gum gum.
[88:44.49]I'm telling you.
[88:44.99]Alright, what am I doing?
[88:50.23]Don't try that at home.
[88:50.93]It hurts.
[88:51.61]Look at that.
[88:51.87]I've already got like a mark here.
[88:53.01]Now my beautiful, beautiful collagen skin has been tainted.
[88:56.36]The donut box is a happy reminder of a bygone era.
[89:00.70]Oh, five, five, five, five, five.
[89:01.62]What are you calling, Sam?
[89:05.14]The White House.
[89:06.04]White House.
[89:06.40]Agent Superbowl speaking.
[89:09.64]Have you checked the baby?
[89:11.50]We'll be right there.
[89:12.54]Hold, please.
[89:13.82]Have you checked the baby?
[89:15.62]Yes, sir.
[89:16.10]Sleeping soundly.
[89:17.50]Oh, good job then.
[89:22.98]Who are you calling, Sam?
[89:29.70]Mr. Pizza.
[89:30.60]Two medium pineapple and asbestos pies, please.
[89:32.95]Don't I have the number?
[89:33.97]Oh yeah?
[89:34.53]Well, same to you, jerk.
[89:36.81]What'd he say?
[89:37.47]Thank you.
[89:38.09]Have a nice day.
[89:38.95]Fuck.
[89:41.41]God, I hate... I'm so easy to... I'm so easy to manipulate.
[89:44.74]You just have to say a series of words and I will... I'm completely manipulatable.
[89:55.96]I don't have that phone number?
[89:57.76]The White House, right?
[90:01.92]Hello, please hold.
[90:02.80]So he's waiting.
[90:03.84]He's holding.
[90:04.46]We can just go.
[90:06.84]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[90:07.48]We can go buy him now.
[90:24.52]Your lipstick is really pretty.
[90:25.66]Now he's off to the White House.
[90:49.20]Just like getting a free subscription.
[90:51.06]Hello.
[90:51.38]Is anyone there?
[90:52.50]Hello.
[90:54.26]Got it.
[90:55.18]Hello.
[90:55.48]You got fucking played.
[90:56.64]Hello.
[91:05.78]Now, a lot of these same folks will say that we're wrong for introducing this federal pudding embargo.
[91:12.13]they envy our freedom what have they got to hide unless they're secretly sitting on stockpiles of pudding and oh yes we will find them they've got nothing to be afraid of so in conclusion America get your back up off the wall dance come on marzipan and good night it's worse than we thought max he's crazier than a caffeine addled dingo in an adelaide maternity ward
[91:36.71]I think he makes a lot of good points.
[91:38.57]Those puddings are trying to steal our jobs.
[91:41.47]And I especially like how he does that spinny thing with his eyes.
[91:46.27]What the hell?
[91:48.44]He looks like the bully from Toy Story mixed with the Goosebumps dummy.
[91:52.68]That's not Abraham Lincoln.
[91:57.90]How do we do that again?
[91:59.22]We hit him over the head, like we do with all hypnotized people.
[92:02.26]Oh, yeah.
[92:02.74]Oh, no.
[92:11.74]That's not Abraham Lincoln.
[92:16.96]Ow, my fucking chest.
[92:17.75]I just read something that was just like...
[92:44.19]Take a look at that.
[92:48.75]I love this country.
[92:50.47]A gun and money.
[92:53.57]Snow globe.
[92:54.93]This snow globe has a little Apollo 13 inside.
[92:57.81]What happens when you shake it?
[92:59.34]I'm afraid to find out.
[93:05.60]The Liberty Bell is a light for this room.
[93:07.90]Liberty Bell lamp?
[93:10.44]Metaphor is such an ugly quality in furniture.
[93:17.05]Say money again.
[93:18.03]I just did.
[93:21.22]Star pillow.
[93:21.94]Throw pillows shaped like stars.
[93:23.98]Interesting, since actual stars are shaped more like throw pillows.
[93:28.99]There's George Washington and the Nutcracker.
[93:32.37]Hi, I'm George Washington.
[93:34.35]Anyone need their nuts cracked?
[93:37.11]Please don't make fun of George Washington.
[93:41.23]Is that supposed to be Bush?
[93:43.49]No, I... Please don't make fun of Washington.
[93:46.27]Let me tell you.
[93:47.13]Like, that's... He's doing one of these.
[93:49.15]Bush.
[93:49.31]Is that what he's doing?
[93:50.67]Sounds like him.
[93:53.28]It's like a mix of, like, how many presidents?
[93:54.90]I don't even know.
[93:59.40]There's the national budget.
[94:00.84]Let's take a look at that.
[94:02.14]Stand back, son.
[94:03.18]That there's the national budget.
[94:09.55]Quite a budget.
[94:11.24]I guess.
[94:11.64]There's three things.
[94:18.50]Let's look at the calendar.
[94:19.90]I want another one of these.
[94:20.72]Wait a minute.
[94:21.54]Talk again?
[94:24.70]That is a dummy.
[94:37.04]Can I look under the desk?
[94:38.02]Or can I look under the desk?
[94:39.62]Where are you?
[94:40.34]Can I go under the desk?
[94:50.81]Interpreters?
[94:51.87]Yeah!
[94:52.63]That is why you fellas are here, right?
[94:54.77]Sure, why not?
[94:56.01]Because I got a meeting with one of them furring dignitaries.
[94:58.77]Always talking that crazy space language.
[95:01.19]He's not going to have anything under here.
[95:03.57]And that's the thing, guys.
[95:04.33]How could I prove that I have anything under here either?
[95:07.00]I could be a dummy right now, too.
[95:10.60]Okay.
[95:11.44]Let me grab another one of these.
[95:17.27]I want another one.
[95:18.01]We have the long haul tonight.
[95:20.09]We're going to do the whole thing.
[95:21.19]Let me grab a drink.
[95:24.01]I'm thirsty.
[95:24.87]It's a hot day.
[95:25.45]I'll be right back.
[95:28.67]Well, that's not covering anything.
[95:30.27]No, it isn't.
[98:46.17]OK.
[98:46.29]What happened to this?
[98:53.98]Where did my chat go?
[98:56.68]Oh.
[99:00.50]There we go.
[99:01.12]Alright, let's play.
[99:06.17]That should be good.
[99:11.86]Uh, you've been hypnotized is probably a good one.
[99:13.77]Snap out of it, Mr. President.
[99:15.39]You've been hypnotized.
[99:16.99]Sure, I haven't been hypnotized.
[99:19.51]That's crazy talk.
[99:20.89]You've got to listen to us, sir, or we'll be forced to take drastic action.
[99:24.29]Don't talk to me about drastic action.
[99:27.47]You ever been pinned down in a drugstore parking lot by a pack of muskrat commandos with nothing left to lose?
[99:32.72]Ever had to gnaw your best buddy's leg off just so you could get his socks and put them on your own ears to fend off the enemy's deadly Sonic regurgitate array?
[99:39.04]Now that's crazy talk.
[99:41.16]I'm impressed.
[99:43.65]I still don't know who this is supposed to be.
[99:48.89]Wake up, Mr. President!
[99:50.57]You've never given up on anything in your life.
[99:52.83]Don't start now.
[99:54.07]That's awful nice of you, fellas, but I haven't been hypnotized.
[99:57.62]Now do we commence with the head trauma, Sam?
[99:59.88]What was that?
[100:01.03]You can't do that.
[100:02.09]You can't make that kind of like... What, am I gonna bop him on the head?
[100:08.49]Let me look around the office.
[100:09.37]Boink!
[100:09.49]Boink!
[100:09.63]Okay.
[100:09.79]So what do I have for items?
[100:11.11]I wanna look under the desk!
[100:12.67]I wanna get under the desk.
[100:37.10]Nice globe.
[100:38.34]Amazing how often I need it in this job.
[100:42.71]Okay.
[100:42.99]Let me see that again.
[100:47.03]Nice globe.
[100:48.13]Amazing how often I need it in this job.
[100:49.73]Why is this all red?
[100:59.20]Hands off the cameras.
[101:03.71]Uh-oh.
[101:06.12]It's a stack of pithy campaign slogans.
[101:08.34]Campaign slogans.
[101:09.02]Oh, don't fool with those.
[101:10.67]Wouldn't want to be caught on national TV with my drawers down again.
[101:18.18]Magazine.
[101:18.48]House of Representatives and gardens.
[101:22.54]Red versus yellow rose.
[101:24.32]Alright.
[101:25.22]I need to talk.
[101:25.68]Let me talk to Chuckles.
[101:28.87]People are fucking driving me crazy with this whole muff obsession.
[101:58.33]What's behind the door?
[101:58.95]Shave.
[101:59.07]Actually, I don't think I need to shave that bad.
[102:22.63]You seem familiar.
[102:23.49]It's the guy from downstairs.
[102:24.97]Yeah, I'm that voice in the back of your head that tells you to mind your own business.
[102:30.29]Oh my fucking god.
[102:31.61]The surly tone.
[102:34.00]I've got it.
[102:35.12]You're that pit boss from the toy mafia.
[102:36.86]Is he wearing lipstick?
[102:37.98]I smell a conspiracy.
[102:39.68]You smell a nosy dog who's going to get smacked if he don't stop asking questions.
[102:53.47]Fucking said on the package that it wasn't going to come off.
[102:58.06]I've got to look good on camera, okay?
[102:59.70]I've got to look good.
[103:01.66]The lighting, don't you know actors and performers, they put on makeup all the time.
[103:10.39]Un-fucking-boom.
[103:15.09]Fucking furious.
[103:18.61]Your favorite actors wear it.
[103:20.27]Everybody wears it.
[103:26.94]We'll be back.
[103:28.02]I cannot wait.
[103:29.08]Trying to keep people away, looking at it, distracting me.
[103:43.23]Alright.
[103:44.07]Whatever.
[103:44.43]I'm not going to let you guys fucking bring me down.
[103:48.63]Is this a rat president?
[103:50.23]Is that PBR?
[103:51.35]Why the fuck would I be drinking PBR?
[103:53.85]Goddamn.
[103:54.05]I just wanted to look good.
[103:55.47]And presentable.
[103:56.15]I can't believe it's taking you guys this long to figure that out.
[104:17.47]These plates commemorate the core values of freedom-loving peoples everywhere.
[104:21.54]Eating a lot and hitting things with sticks?
[104:23.78]Exactly.
[104:26.20]Drinking PBR is less believable than lipstick.
[104:37.21]Wait, what's going on over here?
[104:40.53]What did she say?
[104:42.03]What did she say?
[104:44.35]What did she say?
[104:44.99]I didn't see what she said.
[104:46.05]What did she say?
[104:55.76]No, no.
[104:57.06]Mm-mm.
[105:01.94]Mm-mm.
[105:04.60]I just needed to enhance.
[105:09.80]Alright, I need to pay attention.
[105:12.35]No, I don't want to put a full face of makeup on my face right now.
[105:18.07]I've got enough collagen.
[105:19.83]I've got plenty of collagen.
[105:21.19]I don't need it.
[105:32.06]I could've... Everyone's still talking about my appearance.
[105:37.35]What do I have?
[105:39.43]The boxing glove.
[105:40.15]The bug!
[105:40.73]Should I go over here?
[105:41.61]Are they gonna say anything weird?
[105:45.52]Let's pick him up.
[105:50.15]Okay, here's what he said.
[105:51.85]Well, don't that beat all.
[105:53.45]Hey, Chuckles, check this out.
[105:55.41]When you fold the dollar bill this way, it makes him look like he's Putin.
[106:00.05]Thank you, sir.
[106:00.65]Like Vladimir Putin or like pooing?
[106:03.97]Which one?
[106:05.83]I didn't read the dialog.
[106:15.51]Alright, so he's not going to listen.
[106:17.79]Hello, Mr. President.
[106:21.05]We have to intercept the meeting.
[106:22.98]If I know they show up and start jabbering away about treaties and whatnot, I just let the interpreters figure it out.
[106:30.59]I just keep an eye on them to make sure they don't steal something or try to eat the cat.
[106:38.14]Okay.
[106:38.94]You're under arrest.
[106:39.54]Okay.
[106:39.84]So I have access to... I have access to the room here.
[106:42.62]I think I don't think I can do anything else here.
[106:44.88]Unless there's something I can do with the boxing glove.
[107:08.70]Punch something?
[107:09.40]Break something?
[107:14.56]Trophy?
[107:15.26]Picture?
[107:18.81]I'm not gonna... No.
[107:21.61]Is there like a secret... Okay, war room door.
[107:23.85]We can go this way.
[107:25.31]No one enters the war room.
[107:29.60]That's it.
[107:30.26]You two are coming with me.
[107:32.40]What?
[107:33.00]Why didn't we just listen?
[107:37.45]and stay out now I have to get back to the president he's not supposed to be alone excuse me oh god oh welcome governor wizard the president has been waiting for you governor wizard state than a washed up urination loving former child star no one hello this is the white house hello alright so whizzer is the alright let me go I'm going back in

[108:09.38]Hello?
[108:10.60]Soda candy?
[108:11.60]I can't get him off.
[108:30.39]Were they walking around examining everything and engaging everyone in pointless conversations?
[108:34.21]It's like I drank a bunch of Kool-Aid.
[108:36.33]Those accursed clones.
[108:38.02]When will their devilish mimicry end?
[108:40.42]Help me out with this here potentate, would ya?
[108:42.90]Can't understand a dang word.
[108:45.06]But that doesn't make sense.
[108:47.06]I don't even have an accent.
[108:49.28]Oh no, memento, por favor.
[108:52.20]Impatient little guy, ain't he?
[109:01.03]What's new, Whizzer?
[109:02.23]That's Governor Whizzer, thank you very much.
[109:04.79]Alright, what are you doing here, Governor Whizzer?
[109:08.85]I'm trying to build up nationwide support for the MRSAPP.
[109:13.49]Who's Mr. Sapp?
[109:14.87]And why didn't you want me to know you were talking about him?
[109:17.85]I can spell, you know.
[109:19.93]It's the Mount Rushmore Soda Abuse Prevention Program.
[109:23.73]It's totally changed my life.
[109:26.71]I've been carbonation-free for over four weeks now.
[109:34.74]Tell us about the MRSAPP.
[109:36.74]Be brief.
[109:37.54]I started the Mount Rushmore Soda Abuse Prevention Program after I became governor, to help people get flat, like me.
[109:45.21]But if we can't get federal funding, people all over the Dakotas are going to get right back on the pop.
[109:52.01]I don't work eight hours a day, six days a week, just to throw my money away for some washed-up soda junkies with no sense of self-control.
[109:58.60]You don't have any money, Max.
[110:00.32]Oh, right.
[110:00.88]Never mind.
[110:01.56]Good luck with that, Wiz.
[110:04.71]Alright, we're ready to interpret.
[110:06.65]Let me help you here.
[110:07.63]What do I want from the store?
[110:09.33]Uh, PBR.
[110:09.81]Don't buy that.
[110:10.41]I don't want that in my house.
[110:32.45]I don't want that in my fucking house.
[110:36.75]If it crosses the plane, I'll get itchy.
[110:43.30]I'll be like scratching and I'll break out in hives.
[110:47.94]He doesn't want it with a mouse.
[110:50.00]He doesn't want it with his spouse.
[110:53.97]Kim and I are not married.
[110:56.37]I will not drink it in the
[111:02.29]Ah, living room?
[111:04.53]I will not share it with a broom!
[111:09.29]No P, B, and R!
[111:22.50]Do not buy it from the store!
[111:25.80]That beer sure is a snore!
[111:28.97]We'll be back, sir.
[111:33.39]out out do not like Mr. president we're ready to interpret for you alright let's get this party started Mr. president my fellow americans I come to warn you about a serious epidemic facing our country
[111:54.99]The scourge of soda abuse.
[111:58.39]Nice jawline.
[111:58.99]Many former popheads like myself found ourselves in the endless cycle of addiction and elimination until we believed there was no hope.
[112:09.00]I don't know what you're saying, son, but you're selling it, boy.
[112:12.30]Good job.
[112:13.60]I ask you, how long can this epidemic continue?
[112:18.06]What was that?
[112:19.12]He said...
[112:25.94]What?
[112:26.24]Oh, what do I want from the store?
[112:32.09]Hmm.
[112:35.11]What do I want from the store?
[112:36.27]What do you guys think I should get from the store?
[112:42.17]What do I want?
[112:42.65]Okay.
[112:49.78]Broccoli sounds, yeah, broccoli's not a bad, okay.
[112:51.96]Broccoli, like I had a broccoli.
[112:56.80]Um... Cheez-Its.
[112:58.69]That's a good one too.
[112:59.47]Cheez-Its.
[113:02.65]Hmm.
[113:02.95]Hmm.
[113:04.57]Um... I don't know.
[113:10.67]I think, uh... A...
[113:22.56]I don't know why, but I kind of want one of those grocery store, I've been sitting here on the display for three days sandwiches at the deli.
[113:33.45]You know the ones that are wrapped up and rolled up to a point where they're squished, looks like somebody sat on it in the subway?
[113:41.83]Just popped into my brain and I wanted it, but don't buy that.
[113:44.55]Don't bring that into my house.
[113:45.43]I will not eat that with a fan.
[113:51.07]I will not bring that sandwich to land.
[113:54.99]That's a gamer reference for you guys that were paying attention to that one.
[113:58.38]I need to play the game is what needs to happen.
[114:08.68]Alright.
[114:10.36]What do I actually want from the store?
[114:12.38]I'll get a...
[114:23.37]Like Cheez-Its and maybe some chips.
[114:26.17]Doritos.
[114:27.31]With the regular, just regular nacho Doritos.
[114:32.26]And that's, I think that's good.
[114:35.02]I got sunflower seeds already.
[114:36.16]Alright.
[114:39.76]Don't make fun of me for liking Doritos.
[114:41.22]Doritos are fucking unbelievable.
[114:43.12]People like to make fun of Doritos, but you eat them all the time.
[114:47.27]I know it's like the joke, it's the thing, Doritos and Mountain Dew.
[114:50.77]Mountain Dew's gross, but Doritos are great.
[114:54.23]They are unbelievably good.
[114:58.03]Mountain Dew, they should just convert all those factories.
[115:02.85]Instead of producing Mountain Dew, they should be producing... I don't know, sustainable seafood.
[115:12.06]I think.
[115:13.24]Whatever they do there.
[115:15.14]No Mountain Dew.
[115:20.98]Alright, so...
[115:23.02]There you... I figured out what I wanted from the store.
[115:26.78]Kim?
[115:27.79]She's probably not even fucking here anymore.
[115:30.11]Kim?
[115:31.55]I think what would be great, if you got us a couple pieces of salmon.
[115:38.95]Is she still in the chat?
[115:43.08]Yeah, she's right there.
[115:43.70]She's right there.
[115:47.74]Salmon sounds great.
[115:49.16]It took us a while to get there, but get like a few pieces of salmon.
[115:51.87]We'll make it later tonight.
[115:57.21]Awesome.
[115:58.65]Thank you.
[116:00.41]Everybody say thanks to Kim.
[116:01.53]She's gonna go get us PBR, lipstick, Doritos, salmon, and that's pretty much it.
[116:18.19]What's a guy got to do to get a drink around here?
[116:21.01]I know what you need.
[116:22.59]An ice cold orange sugar fizz.
[116:25.29]I swear by him.
[116:26.41]No!
[116:27.25]That's not what I want at all.
[116:29.49]I must resist.
[116:31.11]But I am thirsty.
[116:33.62]I got some ice cold PBR in here.
[116:36.36]Frosty cold and so delicious.
[116:39.04]All the progress I've made.
[116:41.36]They were about to give me my five week pin.
[116:44.62]I almost feel bad about this.
[116:46.68]I don't have a conscience, Sam.
[116:48.10]I'm not going to do it.
[116:49.06]Don't worry.
[116:49.56]Everyone's freaking out.
[116:50.33]That's a pretty good burp.
[116:59.04]Oh, blessed angels of carbonation.
[117:03.10]Fill me with your syrupy nectar.
[117:05.66]Ew.
[117:07.35]The war room.
[117:08.47]Which way is the war room?
[117:10.23]It's that door right over there!
[117:12.03]But I don't...
[117:30.09]where do you think you're going knock him over wizard I've got to get in there bad we've got a priority red number two here in the oval office no it's just number one escorting the suspect to holding cell for interrogation now we can go in come with me sir but it'll only take a second please let me go that was fun okay and I didn't catch all that what did he say
[117:58.62]I want a big book like that.
[117:59.82]Imagine having a big ass book with a huge quill and you just write whatever you want in there.
[118:07.57]It doesn't even matter.
[118:08.29]It could be the grocery list.
[118:09.65]As you can tell, our grocery list is only five items long.
[118:13.86]So it would be so awesome to write the five items huge like President Jefferson did.
[118:22.23]I think the war room door is your list of bad jokes stupid old piece open it what are you talking about open the door punch it punch it can I put the bug in there a big book of spells hello Mr.. president that was spells were real how cool that be
[118:47.60]We'll be back, sir.
[118:48.65]Now that I got rid of that guy in the room, I don't understand what the point of that was.
[118:55.23]No, I don't want to talk about, like, dangerous spells.
[118:57.37]Like a fireball.
[118:58.17]No, that's scary.
[118:59.31]Electricity, lightning bolt.
[119:00.49]No, no, no.
[119:03.54]I'm not talking about, you know, being able to fly or something, put a spell.
[119:12.80]The ribbon?
[119:13.24]Hey now, that's my super special top secret ribbon.
[119:16.45]Don't touch it.
[119:21.99]There are so many other... There are... Now it's time for some checks and balances, freelance police style.
[119:35.00]Max, will you do the honors?
[119:36.61]Gladly.
[119:37.83]Look it, fellas.
[119:38.75]My fingertips look like little tadpoles.
[119:43.30]cut to them in jail.
[119:44.84]They just don't make these guys like they used to.
[119:46.80]That's no guy, Max.
[119:48.38]It's a damned ugly puppet.
[119:50.41]Ah, the drawstring in his back.
[119:51.89]I told you I wanted to go under the desk and look.
[119:53.63]The first clue should have been the swirly eyes.
[119:55.65]But, silly me, I thought hypnotizee, not hypnotizer.
[119:58.95]What?
[119:59.59]Yes, an ingenious device being used to hypnotize the TV-watching public.
[120:04.93]But who was controlling him?
[120:06.59]Gonna take days to get that smell out of the interrogation room.
[120:09.91]What?
[120:11.17]What have you done?
[120:13.21]It was like that when we got here.
[120:14.61]Sam did it.
[120:15.67]He tripped and bumped his head on the table.
[120:17.63]These two numbskulls managed to off the president.
[120:20.62]It was a deep tissue massage gone horribly wrong.
[120:22.86]Ninjas.
[120:23.38]Sam did it.
[120:24.24]Still, ratings from the last State of the Union address were even lower than reruns of Midtown Cowboys.
[120:30.90]I didn't expect to have to replace the president so soon.
[120:34.24]But now that these idiots have forced my hand, we're standing right here.
[120:38.67]Me!
[120:38.75]Oh, it is Abraham Lincoln.
[121:07.00]Not quite the reaction I would have expected from a Secret Service agent discovering two people over the decapitated body of the President.
[121:13.21]What do you think this fake body is made of?
[121:15.23]Can I keep it?
[121:16.01]No time for that now, Max.
[121:17.39]We've got to stop the... That's going to be in the closet next episode.
[121:27.14]What is that noise?
[121:27.98]Oh.
[121:28.04]She's huge.
[121:31.78]She's not going to be able to sit in there.
[121:37.07]Blessed scuba diving Buddha on a banana boat with cocktail onions and a map to the star's homes.
[121:41.95]Yeah!
[121:42.81]They've reanimated America's most beloved president.
[121:45.86]I always thought Taft was shorter.
[121:47.84]Not Taft, you deficient.
[121:49.79]My fellow Americans.
[121:52.14]I am Abraham Lincoln.
[121:54.70]As you know by now, your president was recently murdered by two mysterious interpreters.
[122:01.04]But turn not to fear and despair.
[122:04.23]I have returned to guide us through this troubled time.
[122:08.53]A vote for me is a vote for Abraham Lincoln.
[122:13.33]I'll get it!
[122:15.78]What's that?
[122:16.16]We've had this talk before.
[122:17.52]Lincoln Memorial.
[122:18.38]Right.
[122:18.90]Hydraulic motors and robotic implants.
[122:20.88]Yes.
[122:21.78]Okay.
[122:22.58]George Washington.
[122:23.42]We're on it.
[122:24.12]Abraham Lincoln.
[122:25.48]Thomas Jefferson.
[122:26.12]Andrew Jackson.
[122:26.89]They always talk like this.
[122:27.69]I hate when they do that.
[122:28.57]You got to answer the phone.
[122:29.83]Okay.
[122:30.03]Fair's fair.
[122:44.63]Max, we're going to make you the next president of the United States.
[122:49.41]Yes!
[122:49.49]What am I saying in this episode?
[122:51.11]I'm not going to say it, but never mind.
[122:52.97]But yeah, like, every single president that is supposed to be from over 200 years ago or 100 years ago or more always has this voice.
[123:02.69]I'm George Washington.
[123:06.08]I'm Abraham Lincoln.
[123:08.48]I'm Thomas Jefferson.
[123:10.94]I'm Andrew Jackson.
[123:14.79]I'm Ronald Reagan.
[123:15.91]See?
[123:17.33]They all sounded like that, but they didn't.
[123:21.80]Abraham Lincoln actually had a high voice.
[123:25.58]It was more like this.
[123:26.98]It was actually kind of like this.
[123:29.46]And if you've seen the Daniel Day-Lewis version, it's as he did it the way that it was supposed to be.
[123:33.94]There's like two or three documented cases of Abraham Lincoln talking.
[123:38.56]He wasn't like this.
[123:41.86]Breaking my immersion.
[123:42.68]I'm deleting the fucking game.
[123:46.00]No, that's actually true.
[123:46.84]I'm not making that up.
[123:48.11]It's real.
[123:48.81]This is like the 5% time when I'm saying something real.
[124:02.37]Mr. Lincoln, as a candidate for office, my pal Max would like to engage in a thoughtful discussion of the key issues.
[124:08.47]Followed by a round of spiteful medslinging.
[124:10.23]Abe Lincoln or Thanos?
[124:11.27]Hmm, I see.
[124:13.90]Well, this is a bit irregular.
[124:16.36]As you're well aware, I'm the most beloved president in history, so I just assumed I'd be running unopposed.
[124:25.38]Oh, no, you didn't.
[124:26.88]You ain't all that.
[124:28.38]I freed the slaves.
[124:30.20]I was star of a popular television sitcom.
[124:32.69]I'm on the penny.
[124:33.95]I was on TV.
[124:35.13]Now, gentlemen, we can resolve this like adults through moderate reasoned debate.
[124:39.87]Very well, then.
[124:41.21]In the spirit of democracy, I say bring it.
[124:46.17]And it's a beautiful day on the White House lawn as we bring you the first in a series of debates for this emergency election for U.S.
[124:52.82]President.
[124:53.22]Uh-oh.
[124:54.44]He's so much taller than the microphone.
[125:16.02]Let's talk about the issues.
[125:17.18]The nation demands family values.
[125:19.44]Let's hear your prepared statement.
[125:21.60]Time out.
[125:22.76]My fellow Americans, warm the crowd up with a joke.
[125:25.49]I'm going to treat this as if it was me, okay?
[125:28.87]I'd come out there with the cuffs undone.
[125:31.47]You know, like cuffs undone, shirt undone.
[125:35.10]You know, like as if I just was dancing at a wedding for 30 minutes, right?
[125:39.26]You know what I'm talking about?
[125:39.93]When you go to a wedding and you get all dressed up and you're stiff as a board and then the first two songs of the wedding, all of a sudden people's ties are undone, their shirts are open, and their cuffs are off.
[125:49.51]So we're talking like two or three songs into wedding is what I would be presenting myself at.
[125:56.04]And I warmed up with a joke.
[125:56.72]This election reminds me of a droll story.
[125:59.50]It seems Chester A. Arthur and the Pope were kayaking down the Amazon one day.
[126:04.58]Suddenly, a tiny candiru fish swims up the Pope's and lodges itself in his .
[126:10.02]Arthur grabs the Pope's pliers and swelled up like a melon.
[126:14.77]And the Pope says, thanks.
[126:16.53]Last time that happened, McKinley wanted to .
[126:20.75]No, wait, wait, wait.
[126:21.41]I think I told it wrong.
[126:24.01]I wouldn't have done that.
[126:28.63]How do you plan to solve the problem of toxic wastes?
[126:32.55]Where do you stand on schools?
[126:34.88]Education's really important!
[127:00.03]Taxes?
[127:00.59]We gotta talk about taxes too.
[127:05.75]What are you going to do about our schools?
[127:10.35]Where do you stand on religion and schools?
[127:12.85]I'm glad that I've been given one more life to give for my country.
[127:19.18]Lincoln pulls out his trusted catchphrase for this election, which delights the crowd, but seems to have no effect on the polls.
[127:26.10]I'm supposed to be winning.
[127:28.62]Read my lips.
[127:30.66]Read my lipstick.
[127:33.60]Presentable on stream.
[127:41.86]Greetings, miserable proles.
[127:43.80]You're not gonna win.
[127:46.96]I'm here to save the country.
[127:48.03]People of Earth, your day of reckoning is at hand.
[127:51.01]You're gonna lose, Max.
[127:54.73]Stall for time.
[127:58.41]How would you describe your tax plan?
[127:59.57]How would you describe your tax plan?
[128:02.65]I'm glad that I've been given one more life to give for my country.
[128:08.94]And Lincoln dodges the question by pulling out his trusty campaign slogan, which pleases the crowd but has no effect on the polls.
[128:18.57]Goddamn, can't spit it out.
[128:22.95]I was gonna.
[128:24.74]There was something solid in there.
[128:26.96]And I'm pretending like I'm not going to freak out about that.
[128:29.82]I was waiting for him to say like a tax percentage and I was going to like... I wasn't really going to do it.
[128:34.10]I'm not going to ruin my computer.
[128:35.10]What, do you think I'm crazy?
[128:39.25]I believe in the ideal of a global community.
[128:42.13]Where America is but a small part.
[128:44.57]We must set aside our differences and work with our fellow nations.
[128:49.14]All united towards one goal.
[128:51.88]The complete and utter annihilation of the godless Belgians.
[128:58.69]I mean, that gets a dog tilt.
[128:59.85]That gets a dog head tilt from me.
[129:02.17]What?
[129:05.35]I want to see a return to prosperity.
[129:06.37]I want to see a return to the prosperity of the America we once knew.
[129:10.88]A chicken in every pot and vice versa.
[129:14.14]A pot in every chicken?
[129:20.01]How do you plan to solve the problem of toxic waste?
[129:23.80]I'm glad that I've been given one more life to give for my country.
[129:30.30]And Lincoln is once again using his trusted campaign slogan, which is raising the crowd, but having no effect on his poll ratings.
[129:36.54]We gotta fuck with that slogan.
[129:42.17]If elected, I promise a return to a happier time in America's past.
[129:47.16]The days when giant thunder lizards marched over the fern-covered marshes of the Midwest, preying on the upstart mammals.
[129:54.16]That's why I don't have face cam on, because I just tried to swallow that burp, and it was going to be loud, and I tried.
[129:59.54]I like to be, I like to perform, but I don't like to be watched.
[130:14.90]Why don't they bring Sam and Max back?
[130:17.58]Is it still going?
[130:18.28]Am I just an idiot?
[130:20.72]Do I have one piece of the puzzle of knowledge here?
[130:27.08]Does Telltale own the characters?
[130:29.83]I thought this was a series before that.
[130:36.55]This is an old point-and-click adventure game, wasn't it?
[130:42.98]Yeah, there's like a comic book series, an old, old point-and-click game.
[130:47.81]Yeah, LucasArts made the first one, right?
[130:51.85]I'm a uniter, not a divider.
[130:53.87]I foresee an America under one rule.
[130:55.83]That's a Bush thing.
[130:56.41]An iron-fisted rule.
[130:57.57]That's a Jordan.
[130:58.19]One rabbit, one law.
[130:59.90]I'm a uniter, not a divider.
[131:00.64]Let your neighbors know that dissent will not be tolerated.
[131:04.46]All hail Max.
[131:09.72]I mean, what am I supposed to do about this?
[131:12.65]Do we just see every option?
[131:15.03]What?
[131:15.45]I have a dream, America.
[131:16.77]How do we progress this?
[131:17.63]It starts out where I'm in an all nude production of Death of a Salesman on Ice.
[131:21.89]But I haven't studied, and I can't remember my lines.
[131:24.99]Suddenly, it begins to rain marshmallows.
[131:27.27]But that's OK, because trees are made of graham crackers, and chocolate bars are the official currency.
[131:33.03]I believe that by working together, we can make that dream a reality.
[131:37.04]Alright.
[131:39.36]Well, that's all.
[131:39.86]That is all.
[131:40.74]Stay frosty, America.
[131:45.80]Cue cards.
[131:47.30]It's the cue cards for Lincoln's speech.
[131:49.14]Oh!
[131:49.42]I'm glad that I've been given one more life to give from my country.
[131:54.36]I'm glad that I have one more life to give from my country.
[132:00.60]I could do a pretty good audiobook, Lincoln, I think.
[132:03.40]Or any ex-president from, like, 1840 to, like, 1930.
[132:06.62]I could do any president.
[132:19.07]What does it say now?
[132:19.49]Two wrongs don't make a right.
[132:24.41]I'm glad that I've been given one more life to... Two wrongs don't make a right.
[132:29.29]I could probably put something here.
[132:30.11]Two wrongs don't... I could probably, like... I could probably Ron Burgundy him or something, right?
[132:36.61]Definitely.
[132:40.43]Where do I get these cue cards from that I need to replace?
[132:46.46]It's the severed head of the president.
[132:48.37]I yearn to hold it aloft and turn giant sea atrocities to stone.
[132:53.04]You're thinking of Medusa's head.
[132:54.98]Oh yeah, I always get those two heads confused.
[133:03.61]Mouthwash commercials are stupid.
[133:07.67]That's all I have to say.
[133:16.55]Uh, I'm going... I don't think I can do anything in here.
[133:20.41]Let's go back.
[133:21.30]Thanks for your contribution.
[133:28.72]You got it.
[133:29.38]Anytime.
[133:31.60]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[133:33.08]What about Sybil?
[133:33.64]Let's go talk to Sybil.
[133:35.99]I'm... There are bugs in my fucking hair.
[133:37.99]There are bugs everywhere.
[133:38.85]Let's go talk to Sybil.
[133:44.06]Don't... I don't use mouthwash.
[133:45.60]I don't really use that.
[133:47.15]I mean... Mouthwash really isn't that actually good for you.
[133:52.39]It just burns and... Don't get, like, the alcohol mouthwash.
[133:55.79]It just burns all the fucking germs in your mouth.
[133:58.61]Even good bacteria, too.
[133:59.58]It kills everything.
[134:02.82]Hey, Sybil.
[134:03.60]What's new in the world of frequent random career reassessment?
[134:06.72]Hi, fellas.
[134:08.04]I'm really excited.
[134:09.44]I found the perfect job for me.
[134:12.24]You don't say.
[134:13.50]That's right.
[134:14.92]I, Sybil Pandemic, am now a professional matchmaker.
[134:18.67]I thought I smelled phosphorus.
[134:20.73]I thought I smelled that joke coming down the turnpike, burning oil and dragging its muffler.
[134:25.15]It's a dating service, Max.
[134:27.35]I figured that if a smart, successful career woman like me could be having so much trouble finding a date, there must be plenty of other people who could use help.
[134:37.56]you can't get a date you're having trouble finding your soul mate you don't know the half of it it seems like all the guys I meet are total losers losers no offense none taken hey or else they're borderline psychopaths no offense men taken it's the borderline cases you have to watch out for
[134:57.20]Could you find dates for us?
[134:58.40]Could you find dates for Max?
[134:59.34]Do we actually go on dates?
[135:00.34]Seriously?
[135:00.98]I mean, sure.
[135:02.86]Why not?
[135:04.14]Stranger things have happened.
[135:07.49]They must have.
[135:08.83]Somewhere.
[135:09.25]I'm choosing not to be offended by that.
[135:12.25]What do we need to do?
[135:13.59]It's easy.
[135:14.39]Just submit an application.
[135:16.96]An application.
[135:17.78]Okay.
[135:20.87]What kind of man are they looking for?
[135:22.06]What kind of man are you looking for?
[135:23.66]Older men.
[135:24.74]Guys with a little history to them are such a turn-on.
[135:29.94]Oh, and tall men.
[135:31.64]And distinguished.
[135:33.10]And he should be experienced.
[135:35.46]Alright, enough already.
[135:37.20]Yes, I will go out with you, Sybil.
[135:39.36]I thought she was talking about me.
[135:51.20]Okay.
[135:51.34]Personality test?
[136:10.14]I don't have a personality matrix so much as a personality vector.
[136:14.04]Once we've found a match, you call your date and agree on a time and place.
[136:18.89]Let me help you guys out.
[136:20.31]Tell me your good points and what you're looking for in a date.
[136:23.57]What am I looking for in a date?
[136:25.97]I'm very spiritual.
[136:27.21]She should have an air of mystery.
[136:28.91]She should love animals.
[136:31.45]Yeah.
[136:33.46]Spiritual.
[136:36.06]Have an air of mystery.
[136:39.10]She should love animals.
[136:41.12]That's the drag finger there.
[136:41.94]That exists now, Max.
[136:42.42]Don't know if you know that.
[136:44.82]She should be...
[137:12.61]She should be tall.
[137:13.83]At least 12 feet.
[137:15.07]Or 4 meters if she's Canadian.
[137:25.41]I'm very spiritual.
[137:26.73]A disciple of the ancient ones.
[137:28.54]Connecting dark magic rituals.
[137:30.36]To bring forth their reign again upon this Earth.
[137:33.52]Rise Shigarath.
[137:35.06]Rise Abyaxolam.
[137:37.22]Yeah.
[137:37.66]12 feet tall?
[137:42.40]Her head's going to be dragging against the ceiling.
[137:46.30]You're going to have to push them.
[137:47.94]You're going to have to get behind them and wedge them in.
[137:51.86]It's going to be like on the top of the ceiling.
[137:55.30]I have an active lifestyle.
[138:03.94]I lead an active lifestyle.
[138:05.40]Always running from the authorities.
[138:08.56]How drunk are you?
[138:12.10]I don't know.
[138:13.86]How drunk am I?
[138:20.82]Why am I hiding the brand?
[138:25.38]Oh, no, hold on a second.
[138:26.96]I gotta be careful.
[138:27.78]They might dox the brand.
[138:30.19]They're gonna dox me from like the brand.
[138:39.51]It's like grocery store
[138:53.02]Alright, I can appreciate a person's inner beauty.
[138:54.50]I can appreciate a person's inner beauty.
[138:56.58]I even have my own sonogram machine.
[138:58.46]Put a brown bag on it.
[139:01.11]It could be anything, though.
[139:04.33]That's all I can think of.
[139:05.35]Oh, that's plenty.
[139:06.57]Now I'll just put your applications into the computer.
[139:12.05]And there it is.
[139:13.61]Max, it says your perfect match is... Cybernetic laser eyes.
[139:18.76]Oh, please.
[139:19.26]Oh, please.
[139:19.70]Oh, please.
[139:20.66]Well, that's interesting.
[139:23.20]It says your perfect match is Sam.
[139:25.86]Disturbing.
[139:27.13]And yet somehow not completely unexpected.
[139:29.49]And Sam, your ideal soulmate is... Abraham Lincoln.
[139:33.83]Wait for it.
[139:35.45]Max.
[139:36.58]Well, there goes another blow to the concept of a fair and just universe.
[139:40.49]Hey, Sam, what do you say we never ever speak of this again?
[139:44.27]Way ahead of you, little buddy.
[139:58.09]See you around, Sybil.
[140:03.61]Okay.
[140:05.12]Well, here's the thing.
[140:08.14]12 feet tall.
[140:10.23]That's pretty big.
[140:13.61]A scary face?
[140:17.49]How?
[140:20.66]That's where I do video intros for my dating service.
[140:23.50]Why is the door locked?
[140:24.76]It's locked?
[140:26.02]Damn it.
[140:26.88]I don't even have a key to that door.
[140:34.78]The casting... room.
[140:40.50]Um... Well, alright.
[140:46.34]I'm so- I'm so sick of this shit.
[140:50.88]Okay.
[140:53.18]Let's go.
[140:53.66]I thought I just got hit by the car.
[140:57.89]The game is too loud?
[140:59.39]Well, fuck man, I'll turn it down.
[141:02.69]Alright, let's go.
[141:03.17]Let's go see Bosco.

[141:05.30]Oh, this is... okay.
[141:12.58]Oh, it's this guy.
[141:13.06]It's Hugh Bliss.
[141:21.72]Whoa, look, Max.
[141:23.14]It's our favorite cultish crackpot, Hugh Bliss.

[141:36.62]Who has that kind of time?

[141:40.84]Why are you here now?
[141:43.96]Why I'm spreading the great news about prismatology!
[141:48.88]The magic and science of unlocking the harmony of colors for a revolution in holistic personal and interpersonal well-being.

[142:28.18]Do you have any magic tricks?
[142:28.96]Show us a magic trick, you bliss.
[142:30.58]Magic is easy when the colors of your soul are within.
[142:33.49]Yeah, yeah, less chatter, more magic.
[142:35.45]Okay.
[142:35.59]Let's do some magic.
[142:36.73]How about I disappear?
[142:39.31]Well, your mind reading is obviously still working.
[142:41.99]It is.
[142:44.55]Now watch me as I vanish.
[142:46.72]Except you won't be able to watch me because I'll be gone.
[142:48.78]I need to do something here.
[143:02.74]It's got to be... Okay, there's got to be something I can do there during that with an item or something.
[143:07.34]Probably something.
[143:08.10]Oh, yes it is.
[143:11.32]It's free.
[143:11.70]Okay.
[143:23.82]He's so pale.
[143:24.50]Not me, I'm red.
[143:25.18]Let's take that free sign.
[143:26.20]Wait, is this a cue card?
[143:27.92]Can I make Abe Lincoln say free home delivery?
[143:31.28]Is that what this is for?
[143:32.86]Why would he need to say that?
[143:57.82]Novelty gumballs.
[143:59.18]Shaped just like the real thing, but made of inedible plastic.
[144:01.58]Huge brain.
[144:02.36]Will your friends annoy your grandparents?
[144:06.28]Alright, let's see what Bosco's doing now.
[144:08.58]What is Bosco up to?
[144:15.30]I did this thing.
[144:16.84]It's bad.
[144:17.30]I'm not even going to say it because I don't want to encourage anybody to do it.
[144:20.86]Greetings, comrades Dog and Rabbit.
[144:23.88]I'm having trouble placing the accent this month.
[144:26.37]Mid-Atlantic states?
[144:27.63]The San Fernando Valley?
[144:29.11]Hmm, I get more of a vague Baltic vibe.
[144:32.02]Something in a light Czech pattern.
[144:34.91]So what's the deal this time?
[145:01.04]What's with the Soviet bloc, Bosco?
[145:02.96]He's perfectly natural, comrades.
[145:05.24]I work with your American government in spirit of Glasnost.
[145:09.34]They know.
[145:09.92]They know.
[145:10.92]Who knows what?
[145:12.00]The feds, man.
[145:13.16]Uncle Sam.
[145:14.20]The government's watching us all the time.
[145:16.58]So that's why I always feel an overbearing presence just out of my field of vision, watching and judging my every move.
[145:23.06]That's me, Max.
[145:26.40]What's that smell?
[145:27.58]Something in here smells like fermented hate.
[145:29.91]It's like sweaty jock straps soaked in boiled cabbage with a dash of sulfur.
[145:34.05]Keep it down, guys.
[145:35.51]You're scaring off the other customers.
[145:39.27]Who?
[145:39.73]What other customers?
[145:40.45]There's nobody even in here.
[145:41.25]Max and I are always the only ones in here.
[145:43.61]It's a good thing.
[145:44.57]Merchandise is always available.
[145:47.28]Coming in here is like visiting old friends.
[145:50.10]Some of these cereal boxes are from the McKinley administration.
[145:53.44]I carved our initials in one of the weenies, so we'll be best friends forever, Sam.
[145:57.42]Alright.
[146:01.29]You need some new weenies.
[146:03.19]When's the last time you cleaned out the weenie rotisserie?
[146:05.89]Needs no cleaning.
[146:07.61]Adds vintage flavor to tasty fries.
[146:11.41]Ugh.
[146:11.59]Alright, why are you getting watched?
[146:14.57]Why is the government spying on you, Bosco?
[146:16.52]I don't know.
[146:17.02]For what?
[146:17.42]Maybe it's because I know too much.
[146:19.74]Um, just humor the poor guy, Max.
[146:22.22]But I make new start in America, which I love.
[146:25.80]So there's no need to targeting me.
[146:30.92]Okay.
[146:31.36]Where's the defense this time?
[146:33.14]Usually has something against the feds.
[146:34.90]He's the people, comrades.
[146:36.78]Workers will overthrow fascist regime.
[146:39.52]What about us loafers?
[146:40.98]All are welcome.
[146:42.71]Come day of victory, workers will unite to bring downfall of corrupt administration.
[146:47.53]We will number in tens of millions.
[146:51.03]That's a lot of Bolsheviks.
[146:52.73]No, he's all true.
[146:54.75]Plus, I'm working on a satellite missile defense system.
[146:59.34]A missile defense system.
[147:02.65]Missile defense system?
[147:04.19]Isn't that more than a little bit overkill?
[147:06.01]Nyet!
[147:06.95]We are strong like bear against attack!
[147:10.27]Yeah, I remember the hot dogs in school.
[147:36.43]For some weird reason, I don't know why this was, but why are all school lunch hot dogs cut like four times?
[147:44.93]They slice it apart down the middle, apart on the right, apart on the left, they fray out the, I don't know why they did that.
[147:51.73]They didn't do that in your school?
[147:54.41]They like cut them up down the middle like three or four times, they frayed out.
[148:05.31]They didn't do that anywhere else?
[148:12.19]So they don't explode in the microwave.
[148:17.31]That's only done for boiled hot dogs.
[148:19.01]Well, there you go.
[148:23.60]We aren't that old.
[148:26.60]We aren't, no.
[148:27.64]I got the wrong vocal context there.
[148:31.28]It's not, we're not that old.
[148:33.04]It's, we're not that old.
[148:37.98]Oh, right.
[148:38.48]Okay.
[148:38.92]Sometimes.
[148:39.50]You can change the way that sentence works by changing a little bit of inflection.
[148:47.17]Alright.
[148:47.81]Tell us about the missile defense system.
[148:48.75]I know I'm old.
[149:00.85]Okay.
[149:02.05]So he wants to build a defense system.
[149:03.79]He's no Bosco, comrades.
[149:05.45]He's only loyal worker Boscovorsky, who is no threat to glorious American government whatsoever.
[149:14.07]Wheaties.
[149:14.73]What do you got?
[149:15.13]Anything new in here?
[149:15.83]Something I can do?
[149:16.47]Microwave.
[149:17.50]Should I put a hot dog in here?
[149:18.36]No, I want a hot dog.
[149:18.84]I've got a great idea involving you, a microwave, and six feet of aluminum foil.
[149:22.80]Fuck, man.
[149:23.52]Go on.
[149:26.42]Maybe another time.
[149:29.67]I want a... I want a Chicago dog.
[149:32.43]You know what I'm talking about.
[149:35.07]You do.
[149:35.89]I know you do.
[149:36.53]You just fucking raised your hand.
[149:37.67]You went, yes!
[149:38.41]You fucking said Chicago dog.
[149:39.93]I'm talking directly to you, not anybody else here.
[149:42.07]Only you.
[149:43.15]That's the only people I'm talking to right now.
[149:53.59]You want a dog from Chicago?
[149:54.69]I want a Chicago-style dog.
[149:57.71]Look it up.
[149:58.73]See what that means.
[150:03.31]Alright, I think we're good here.
[150:04.89]I can go back to... I want to go to the office.
[150:13.60]Make one, it's not complicated.
[150:14.64]I... I... I... I'm currently here.
[150:19.86]Alright, hey, I'll see you later.
[150:23.61]I'm gonna go make... I don't have my stream deck hooked up.
[150:26.01]Never mind.
[150:28.01]I'll be back in like 30 minutes.
[150:30.05]I'm gonna go make a fucking Chicago hot dog.
[150:33.35]Let's look in here.
[150:39.53]If I can buy something.
[150:42.85]I will.
[150:43.87]Let me just go in an order and we'll clean it up.
[150:50.20]You know what I love?
[150:51.94]I shouldn't be talking about this.
[150:55.24]I love hot dogs on the grill when you leave them on for way too long.
[150:59.44]I'm one of those fucking freaks that when the, you know, your uncle's on the grill and they've got 20, 30 hot dogs lined up.
[151:10.35]They're all on just two racks, right?
[151:12.87]And they just forget about three of them.
[151:15.53]People come up, yeah, you want a dog?
[151:16.61]Yeah, take one.
[151:17.21]Or whatever barbecue you go to.
[151:19.44]Everyone gets a dog and then there's like three that are just left sitting there just rotting.
[151:24.76]And they turn black.
[151:27.80]I love those so much.
[151:31.73]The whole thing around is just black.
[151:35.37]It's unbelievable.
[151:39.45]Call me weird if you want, that's fine.
[151:41.88]It's just charred completely.
[151:48.16]I love it.
[151:48.86]It's so good.
[151:50.32]I don't eat that often, though, because it's really not that good for you at all.
[151:53.94]Alright, is there anything in here I can do?
[152:03.05]A very disturbed individual sits here.
[152:07.01]Bulletin board?
[152:08.17]When I got this thing, I thought it would be useful.
[152:10.25]Burnt is not a flavor.
[152:11.23]Yeah, it is.
[152:16.00]Um, extra toasty Cheez-Its will have to disagree with you on that.
[152:21.17]I was one of those people, I was one of those people on Facebook that demanded it.
[152:25.89]You know they said, oh by popular demand we have a box of toasty Cheez-Its, burnt Cheez-Its.
[152:31.37]I was the popular demand.
[152:37.24]Toasted, not burnt.
[152:39.30]I like the burnt ones.
[152:40.08]I don't think that's that weird.
[152:49.07]I don't think there's anything in here.
[152:50.13]What about out the window?
[152:56.26]I don't think there's anything else.
[152:59.32]What about in the wastebasket?
[153:01.14]Charcoal.
[153:03.94]I don't like that with hamburgers.
[153:05.18]I like that only with hot dogs, though.
[153:06.24]I don't think there's anything else in here.
[153:10.13]Old case files?
[153:11.41]I don't remember.
[153:16.73]20 years worth of electric bills take up a surprising amount of space.
[153:28.60]Okay, well... Let's go back to Bosco and see if I can buy something from him.
[153:33.60]What I can buy this time.
[153:39.47]You like flat root beer too?
[153:43.23]I don't really like that much carbonated stuff.
[153:46.91]I mean, I'm drinking a seltzer water right now, but that's just because the only reason why this is in the fridge is because I had family over and you need something.
[153:57.88]Right?
[153:58.06]I had a bunch of family come over and I didn't want to be the child that has Mountain Dew, Coke, and vodka in his fridge.
[154:11.34]So I got like seltzers and juices.
[154:18.19]I wanted to look at least half responsible.
[154:25.03]What?
[154:28.99]I like soda!
[154:29.78]I don't drink it that much anymore.
[154:31.56]Years ago, I used to drink it all the time.
[154:41.01]what do you got what do you got is most glorious invention comrade cider is useful for how you say questioning questioning is true serum makes easy even the most difficult how you say interrogation interrogation is this another one of your half-baked overpriced gimmicks or does it actually work
[155:05.54]Both will make anyone get rid of inhibitions and telling, uh, how you say, uh, complete and honest truth.
[155:12.72]It's gonna be alcohol.
[155:13.42]Your accent sucks.
[155:14.74]It's gonna be vodka.
[155:16.23]It's gonna be vodka.
[155:17.53]It's the Russian thing.
[155:18.61]It's gonna be a bottle of vodka.
[155:24.11]We'd like that truth serum, Comrade Boscovich.
[155:26.53]It's good.
[155:27.39]Price is 867.5309 rubles.
[155:28.23]How much is that in real money?
[155:29.75]100 million dollars.
[155:34.92]I think your rate of exchange is a little off, Baskovorsky.
[155:38.45]Fall of Berlin Wall brings great strength to our economy.
[155:43.73]100 million.
[155:44.01]That's a lot.
[155:44.81]That's not that bad.
[155:45.37]I would still use it.
[155:46.07]I'd still use... No, I would still use that.
[155:48.01]What?
[155:48.39]You...
[156:15.75]That's not that bad.
[156:16.55]It could have been way worse.
[156:18.17]That could have been much worse.
[156:19.49]That would be terrible if it was anywhere else.
[156:21.21]Earwax is weird and gross, but it's not like somebody shoving a toothbrush.
[156:30.96]It's not somebody shoving a toothbrush.
[156:33.14]Whatever.
[156:47.71]What's on the shelf?
[156:48.35]Is it bread?
[156:50.85]Foamy bread.
[156:52.05]Made from real styrofoam?
[156:53.93]No, artificial styrofoam.
[156:58.77]Artificial styrofoam.
[157:02.36]Somebody putting a toothbrush in their ear, you can rinse that and you're not gonna freak out about that.
[157:07.82]Somebody shoving a toothbrush... ...somewhere else, you would never use it again.
[157:17.94]I would say, oh, I brushed my eye with your toothbrush.
[157:20.12]And it's like, oh, that's weird.
[157:21.16]It's kind of gross and weird.
[157:22.40]But I'll just clean it with hot water.
[157:25.34]And I'll sanitize it with alcohol.
[157:34.83]That's not that big of a problem.
[157:39.37]Where are we going, Sam?
[157:42.77]Earwax is not water soluble.
[157:44.39]You need another solvent, which is probably toxic.
[157:49.57]Okay.
[157:52.61]Okay, the chat full of scientists.
[158:00.30]It's already up.
[158:03.13]We're off to the White House.
[158:04.69]Oh boy!
[158:07.53]That shitting grin, it's back.
[158:15.19]That's fucking funny.
[158:16.45]It's not water soluble.
[158:18.43]So you're gonna be putting earwax in your mouth.
[158:20.77]Alright, I need... Let's go back in here.
[158:25.07]Wait, can I go in here now?
[158:29.03]That's so fucking funny.
[158:30.95]That's my favorite comment of the entire day.
[158:33.13]That's so great.
[158:44.87]Just calling me out on my bullshit, I love it.
[158:46.63]Alright, is there anything else in here?
[159:04.67]I'm gonna go replace this... I have a sign.
[159:07.25]Let's see if I can do it.
[159:17.01]Camera.
[159:17.57]There's nothing in here.
[159:29.31]I'm slouching so bad.
[159:30.57]Did I miss anything in here?
[159:31.79]No.
[159:31.85]Maybe you can see the whole cam right now.
[159:39.22]Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind.
[159:50.38]What did I mean?
[159:53.12]Alright, I thought this was part of the... I thought it was part of the camera for a second.
[160:00.69]I'm not blind.
[160:01.33]What did he have sex with?
[160:46.39]Are you good?
[160:47.15]I'm glad that I've been given one more life in my country.
[161:02.60]I did not have sex with that woman.
[161:05.60]Jeremiah, how are you doing that?
[161:08.36]Doing what, dude?
[161:14.21]Free home delivery.
[161:15.98]Alright, so what do we got?
[161:22.07]No, they're all gonna be bad.
[161:24.27]I wanna see if I can still do it.
[161:30.37]Could I still do it?
[161:31.91]I haven't tried to do the one-eye thing in a long, long time.
[161:35.11]Earwax is weird and gross, but it's not, like, sh- This is not even the thing- Was one-eye going?
[161:48.13]Was it?
[161:48.41]Did it work?
[161:50.19]Okay, just making sure it worked.
[161:52.67]So I need another card because there's three here.
[161:55.41]That's the one I'm going to leave there.
[162:00.44]Alright, let's try it again.
[162:02.30]Let's just see what happens.
[162:03.06]Alright.
[162:16.67]Let's talk about the issues.
[162:18.41]Contestants, it's time for our lightning round.
[162:21.05]Mr. Lincoln, I'm going to name some of the tough issues facing our country today.
[162:25.09]I'd like you to sum up your stand on those issues in a few concise words.
[162:28.56]Well, alright.
[162:30.64]I'm afraid this will have to be completely off the top of my head as I have nothing prepared.
[162:43.43]Where do you stand on religion and schools?
[162:47.26]I did not have sex with that woman.
[162:50.88]Whoa, the debate has taken on a decidedly confessional tone with that nonsensical reply from candidate Lincoln.
[162:56.81]Luckily for him, the crowd is ignoring it.
[163:09.74]We have nothing to fear but fear itself.
[163:13.30]And the chupacabra, madre de dios, he'll kill us all.
[163:17.68]Alright, hold on.
[163:18.80]That is all.
[163:22.00]What did the other one say?
[163:23.29]A thousand points of light.
[163:26.91]A thousand points of light.
[163:31.23]The buck stops here.
[163:31.99]The buck stops here.
[163:35.23]Free home delivery.
[163:36.13]Free home delivery.
[163:39.31]I'm glad that I've been... No, not that one.
[163:43.30]Two wrongs don't make...
[163:47.49]Not that one.
[163:56.29]A thousand points of light!
[163:59.69]Let's do the home delivery one.
[164:01.51]Okay.
[164:04.95]Free home delivery.
[164:11.75]Let's talk about the issues.
[164:16.87]How do you plan to solve the problem of toxic waste?
[164:21.49]Free home delivery.
[164:22.91]Free home delivery.
[164:23.53]Didn't like it.
[164:24.11]What?
[164:44.21]Oh, they got a Ralph Nader joke in there.
[164:46.03]Alright, um... So what was the thousand points of light?
[165:00.30]I need another card, maybe.
[165:01.30]I think... I don't know.
[165:02.92]I don't get it.
[165:03.34]Wait, wait, wait.
[165:04.12]Let's get this one correct.
[165:08.62]The nation is family values.
[165:10.30]Mr. Lincoln, perhaps you'd like to speak about the importance of family values.
[165:14.62]Of course.
[165:15.74]A strong family unit is the rock upon which our society is built.
[165:20.96]It's easy today, in this age of your blinged-out horseless carriages and racy daguerreotype magazines, to believe that honesty and fidelity are outdated concepts.
[165:33.49]But I stand proud.
[165:35.43]I have been completely faithful to my lover, Mary Todd, for over seven score years.
[165:41.43]I did not have sex with that woman.
[165:42.78]I've never even looked at another woman.
[165:58.45]Let's hear your statement.
[166:01.89]Mr. Lincoln, could you elaborate on your stand on family values?
[166:05.53]Without a strong, honest, and faithful family, I've been faithful to my wife for 150 years.
[166:14.86]Mr. Lincoln, the networks are looking for a soundbite.
[166:17.46]Would you care to share a few words with us?

[168:03.81]Religion and schools.
[168:07.94]Religion and schools.
[168:27.54]Where do you stand on religion and schools?
[168:30.32]Two wrongs don't make a right.
[168:33.40]Did we hear that right?
[168:35.50]I don't want religion or schools.
[168:38.42]Wow, that's gotta hurt him in the polls.
[168:47.13]So a thousand points of light is what, your tax plan?
[168:53.61]The reason why I wasn't using these is because I thought I had to get more.
[168:58.29]I thought these were just here by default to have something to look at.
[169:00.79]You know, I thought I had to go get them.
[169:01.90]What is your tax plan?
[169:06.66]What does a thousand points of light even mean?
[169:08.02]Hmm.
[169:30.29]That's a thousand points of light?
[169:33.21]What does that even mean?
[169:41.05]Free home delivery for tax plan?

[170:13.07]I need another one of those stands.

[170:26.25]Post no bills.
[170:27.16]I'm surprised.
[170:41.23]Please do not feed the submarine.
[170:43.09]What can you feed a submarine anyway?
[170:45.51]Nothing.
[170:46.65]What are you guys talking about?
[170:49.19]What are you guys talking about?
[171:06.63]Room program.
[171:07.95]I guess the country really is hard up for cash.
[171:11.35]He's being stupid.
[171:12.49]What?
[171:12.73]I don't think there's any more over here.
[171:27.34]On the stage?
[171:28.32]What about behind here?
[171:29.22]Flyer?
[171:33.98]Nothing back here?
[171:36.59]No.
[171:38.25]I need to find another cue card stand somewhere.
[171:43.46]There's definitely not one in the office, the White House, because I just was in there.
[171:52.03]It's definitely back here.
[171:53.53]It's not in there.
[171:55.23]It's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not.
[171:57.45]Oops.
[172:01.91]He doesn't know.
[172:02.65]Pepe laugh.
[172:05.24]What kind of noise do you think that Pepe laugh is doing?
[172:17.63]Is it even laughing?
[172:23.63]Or is it going like... Go in the dumpster.
[172:31.25]I don't know what it's doing, but not that.
[172:46.97]I can't see it.
[172:49.65]So I don't know what it looks like.
[172:51.45]No, yeah, I can.
[172:55.75]No, that's not even the right one.
[172:56.70]I have BTTV.
[173:01.80]Alright, I need a fucking flyer.
[173:06.50]And here?
[173:07.44]President appoints action figure as Secretary of Defense.
[173:11.05]That is pretty crazy.
[173:12.69]Well, at least it was an action figure of John Shaft.
[173:15.49]Oh, I can dig it.
[173:18.32]I have BTTV.
[173:18.98]You guys, I have it.
[173:19.76]I already have it.
[173:20.28]I've got BTTV.
[173:20.58]I'm not missing any cards.
[173:22.44]Well, how do I do the tax plan one?
[173:24.14]What are you talking about?
[173:25.30]Let me go back here.
[173:51.01]Oh, I can go in here.
[173:52.23]Lefty's.
[173:53.79]Lefty's Power Tools.
[173:56.13]Why is he pronouncing it B-T-T-V?
[173:57.25]How would you pronounce it?
[173:58.73]Okay.
[174:08.58]Remember that afternoon when I put on a baseball cap and spent hours out here playing fizzball with Lefty?
[174:13.99]If you mean that night when you put on a hockey mask and spent hours chasing Lefty down the street with a face on.
[174:18.51]That's how it's said, yeah.
[174:19.61]Precious man.
[174:20.13]What am I doing wrong?
[174:29.94]None of these do anything?
[174:32.12]Give me all you got.
[174:33.36]It's the Army's new recruiting slogan.
[174:35.39]That's a lot better than their old one.
[174:37.09]What are ya, chicken?
[174:38.43]Gonna cry now, baby?
[174:39.46]Tax plan, give me all you got.
[174:41.40]Oh my god, it only took him like an hour to figure this out!
[174:54.25]Right?
[174:54.49]He doesn't know.
[175:05.55]Do you feel in charge?
[175:09.11]Yes!
[175:09.43]Oh, he doesn't have the information.
[175:22.29]He lacks information.
[175:25.39]His face is shaped like a banana and he doesn't have information.
[175:35.71]Alright, let's put this last one on, and let's get, uh, let's sink him.
[175:42.55]No.
[175:42.97]Get on there.
[175:43.57]There it is.
[175:45.38]How would you describe your tax plan?
[175:49.16]Give me all you got.
[176:01.35]And candidate Lincoln has proposed one shocker of an economic strategy, which even Democrats are calling a trifle excessive.
[176:07.88]That had to have hurt him in the polls.
[176:11.78]Flies up good.
[176:13.32]How am I beating... How did Ralph Nader get 21%?
[176:16.38]That wasn't even close to what really happened.
[176:28.83]So what do I do now?
[176:41.86]Please do not feed the shocks.
[176:45.92]I need 1%.
[176:47.30]Can Max just say something interesting and we can go from there?
[176:50.72]No.
[177:00.33]You guys want to see how strong I am?
[177:04.37]I don't usually do this on stream, but I'll do it now.
[177:07.75]Back to the office.
[177:08.75]Shotgun!
[177:13.13]I'm gonna fucking crush this can on my head.
[177:24.37]It's a party trick, I haven't done this shit in a long time.
[177:45.13]Let's go see Sybil.
[177:55.53]Bald material.
[177:59.22]There's a bunch of people in here that I know.
[178:01.19]A stand-up comic does the same act for like two years.
[178:03.45]You know that, right?
[178:04.09]When you go see... When you go see... Who's a famous comedian that's cool right now that people watch?
[178:09.73]I don't know.
[178:10.03]But they do the same material for like two years and they redo jokes.
[178:12.97]They make new material after a couple of years.
[178:17.69]When you go to see Dane Cook at Madison Square Garden, he's doing the same show that he did a year ago.
[178:27.51]In fucking Tampa!
[178:36.07]There's 3,300 people here.
[178:37.17]At least 100 of those are from Tampa.
[178:40.25]So they haven't seen it yet.
[178:43.36]Hey, Sybil.
[178:44.14]How goes the dating game?
[178:45.56]Computer generated love is in the air.
[178:49.36]OK.
[178:52.34]Uh, what are you looking for on a date?
[178:54.03]What are you looking for on a date again?
[178:57.17]Tall, older man with a good career.
[179:00.03]That sounds like Abraham Tall Lincoln.
[179:04.33]How does this dating service work again?
[179:06.10]Oh.

[180:11.11]Take care, man.
[180:12.85]Sorry I didn't live up to your expectations and shit.
[180:19.05]How's business?
[180:20.23]Slow right now, but those applications are going to start coming in at any moment.
[180:27.37]How do I do an application?
[180:31.18]See you around, sir.
[180:34.40]Oh, there it is.
[180:34.74]You boys want to try the dating scene again?
[180:36.74]No, thanks.
[180:38.42]Just drop an application in there if you change your mind.
[180:42.66]Application?

[180:45.26]Huh?
[180:46.96]Huh?
[180:49.16]What did I... Help me out here.
[180:57.67]Didn't she give it to me?
[181:05.31]Solve it on your own.
[181:13.98]Romance is a lot like this cactus.
[181:16.50]Sharp and prickly at first, but worth the effort for the miracle of life at its core.
[181:22.11]I was thinking more fake and unappealing.
[181:24.51]Cactuses are cool.
[181:25.33]What's wrong with a cactus?
[181:33.38]Who's playing this game?
[181:34.28]Me or you?
[181:35.34]Me and sometimes you.
[181:37.82]Sometimes.
[181:51.05]But mostly me, though.
[181:54.09]Okay, here's what she said.
[181:55.59]What'd she say?
[181:56.77]Meter maid?
[181:57.64]Nah.
[181:58.70]Movie industry executive?
[182:00.62]Done that already.
[182:01.28]Hey, this looks good.
[182:03.14]Shuttle pre-flight analyst.
[182:05.34]Oh, it's part-time only.
[182:06.98]Thank you, sir.
[182:09.12]Okay.
[182:11.37]So where do I get an application?
[182:12.93]I already took it, but I didn't... Turn on the click maps.
[182:17.01]No, no, no, no.
[182:18.93]You boys want to...
[182:20.16]No, thanks.
[182:21.36]Just drop an application in there.
[182:23.42]I gotta do an application.
[182:29.84]Romance is a lot like this cactus.
[182:31.46]I've got, like, ear problems.
[182:32.32]Hold on.
[182:32.52]Sharp and prickly at first, but worth the effort for the mute.
[182:36.01]I was thinking more fake and unappealing.
[182:38.01]But your answer is good, too.
[182:38.65]You already did the application, and they agreed to never speak again.
[182:40.69]Yeah, but don't... How do I get one for somebody else?
[182:56.44]No.
[183:04.82]Shit.
[183:15.05]I have to get one more percent of the vote.
[183:16.85]Listen.
[183:17.03]Listen.
[183:17.29]Listen.
[183:29.67]Can't go down the sewer.
[183:30.89]Let's go talk to Lincoln.
[183:34.26]Jerma's really getting his money worth in dollars per hour.
[183:46.86]Hey, according to how long to be these each or two hours each.
[183:54.08]We've been going for three hours.
[183:57.84]I've got about 40 minutes or so to beat this one.
[184:02.00]Plus, by the way, I've been pausing like this and talking about dentists and stuff.
[184:07.04]So add like another 30 or 40 minutes.
[184:14.14]And I like to take my time.
[184:15.08]I like to look at stuff.
[184:22.35]Uh-oh, chat's getting restless.
[184:24.45]Better drink a PBR.
[184:29.93]That is all.
[184:35.13]It's Lincoln's campaign flyer.
[184:36.85]I want you.
[184:37.49]Honest.
[184:38.81]Dedicated.
[184:39.73]Over a century of experience.
[184:41.80]Abraham Lincoln is your man.
[184:43.16]Mm-hmm.
[184:56.22]Where are we going, Sam?
[184:58.18]Back to the office.
[184:59.19]Shotgun!
[184:59.98]Found it.
[185:02.48]I can't go back.
[185:03.54]I want to like have bad posture and fucking... Alright, so we're gonna drop this in the box and then Sybil's gonna fall in love with Abraham Lincoln.
[185:16.05]And then we get to ask about family values, which means I'm in love with Abraham Lincoln and I would love to have him cheat on his wife with me, right?
[185:27.84]Hey, Sybil, how goes the dating game?
[185:30.05]Computer-generated love is in the air.
[185:35.61]See you around, Sybil.
[185:40.97]Got a flyer.
[185:41.91]What's this?
[185:42.71]A new application?
[185:43.78]Yeah, it's for a friend of ours.
[185:45.70]Let's see.
[185:47.00]Not the Abraham Lincoln.
[185:49.56]He's tall, distinguished, loves the theater.
[185:53.50]He sounds perfect.
[185:54.82]Nobody else has that name.
[185:56.11]That chump doesn't have half my cute, fluffy marketability.
[185:59.41]Hey, what's going on here?
[186:01.67]Internet?
[186:02.17]Computer?
[186:02.95]Nothing.
[186:03.53]This guy sounds perfect for me.
[186:06.07]Oh, but he didn't leave his phone number.
[186:08.83]Okay, give your number to Abraham Lincoln.
[186:17.89]Okay, so now we talk, hey Lincoln, here's the phone number for you.
[186:24.50]No, alright.
[186:27.86]I got the phone number for Abraham Lincoln to go back.
[186:32.47]What's her number?
[186:33.33]I don't know.
[186:38.07]I have no idea.
[186:40.13]I'm implying that they know.
[186:41.33]Let's go see.
[186:46.57]I want something to drink, but I don't want to drink alcohol.
[187:11.32]Alright, anything I can get from you here?
[187:14.49]Let's hear it.
[187:15.09]We found you a woman.
[187:17.09]Mr. Lincoln, we've picked out a single lady friend who would be just perfect for you.
[187:21.13]She has a job and still has all her own teeth.
[187:25.25]Let me give you her number so you can give her a call.
[187:27.64]Ain't no reanimated president too big to appreciate a booty call.
[187:30.80]Know what I'm saying?
[187:32.16]What?
[187:33.44]The idea is preposterous.
[187:36.76]I've been happily married for over 150 years.
[187:41.74]I would never consort with another woman.
[187:45.15]Oh, I see.
[187:46.37]So the rumors are true.
[187:47.95]What rumors?
[187:49.59]Nothing.
[187:53.18]Time out.
[188:08.05]Mr. Lincoln, would you like to say a few words to the audience?
[188:12.05]Thank you.
[188:13.03]This is a date that will be remembered for centuries to come.
[188:17.54]Today is the day we return America to greatness.
[188:22.18]I stand here at the steps of the White House, not above the people, but with the people.
[188:28.44]Only one man can lead the nation through this troubled time.
[188:31.78]I, Abraham Lincoln, am that man.
[188:35.95]The time to act is now.
[188:38.83]Thank you.
[188:40.49]I've heard better addresses from the 411 operator.
[188:43.99]What did you just say?
[188:45.79]Hey, Lincoln!
[188:46.87]Captain Ahab called!
[188:48.51]He wants his beard back!
[188:50.29]I'm gonna slap you silly, you little punk!
[188:53.91]That on camera?
[188:56.15]He just said that on camera.
[188:57.23]He just threatened me on camera.
[189:06.40]Oh, wait, wait, wait!
[189:06.98]I gotta collect the bug!
[189:07.74]The bug's just still sittin' there.
[189:10.75]I know, I gotta get the bug.
[189:18.71]What did he say?
[189:19.67]Repeat it.
[189:20.01]He's not gonna repeat it all, is he?
[189:26.64]Speaking as somebody said the word saved.
[189:28.90]Holy shit, I haven't done it once.
[189:39.87]I want like a hot dog too.
[189:41.15]Where are we going, Sam?
[189:43.70]Back to the office.
[189:44.70]Shotgun!
[190:10.11]Who are you calling, Sam?
[190:13.51]Sybil.
[190:14.18]Hello, Abe?
[190:15.44]Is it you?
[190:17.60]Sure.
[190:18.38]Honest Abe here.
[190:19.22]Hey.
[190:19.72]Very funny, Sam.
[190:21.02]I have to keep this line open for his call.
[190:29.73]Who are you calling, Sam?
[190:32.71]Sybil.
[190:33.33]Hello, Abe?
[190:34.15]There we go.
[190:36.54]I stand here at the steps of the White House.
[190:38.50]I am Abraham Lincoln.
[190:39.91]I am that man.
[190:46.57]Would you like to go out?
[190:59.74]This is a date that will be remembered for centuries.
[191:03.79]Uh...
[191:05.57]I stand here at the steps of the White House's location.
[191:07.93]So this is a date that will be remembered for centuries.
[191:10.03]This is a date that will be remembered for centuries to come.
[191:14.37]Oh my.
[191:15.53]You are a charmer, aren't you?
[191:18.43]Well then, Mr. Rail Splitter, where would you like to meet?
[191:21.84]At the steps of the White House.
[191:25.36]I stand here at the steps of the White House.
[191:28.24]At the White House.
[191:29.34]Got it.
[191:30.20]What time should I meet you?
[191:33.94]The time to act is now.
[191:37.04]The time to act is now.
[191:38.81]Oh, I love that decisiveness.
[191:42.07]I'll rush right over.
[191:43.65]I'm gonna slap you silly, you little punk.
[191:47.35]What?
[191:47.53]I didn't catch that last part.
[191:49.75]I will feast on your entrails and devour your soul.
[191:59.09]Why would you do that?
[191:59.93]You just blew it.
[192:01.07]See you soon.
[192:01.69]Gotta go.
[192:01.95]You just blew it.
[192:02.85]Why would you do that?
[192:07.39]You said I was going to slap and... So to sum up, family values are the bedrock of this nation.
[192:16.02]Our fidelity, honesty, and loyalty to family is our most sacred asset as Americans.
[192:24.66]Candidate Max, your rebuttal?
[192:28.27]Yoo-hoo, Mr. Lincoln.
[192:30.57]I believe we have a question in the audience from someone who is not candidate Lincoln's wife.
[192:35.63]Oh, hi, Sam.
[192:36.84]Hi, Max.
[192:37.98]Greetings, random harlot.
[192:40.22]Abe, I'm here.
[192:41.46]Are you ready for our date?
[192:43.46]What?
[192:44.82]I've never seen this woman before in my life.
[192:48.17]But on the phone, you sounded so eager to meet me.
[192:50.55]Quick, read the cue card.
[192:51.69]I did not have sex with this woman.
[192:53.23]I did not arrange a date with this woman.
[192:56.53]Oh, so she's good enough to fool around with, but not to date?
[193:00.17]Mr. Lincoln, I can't believe you're doing this to me.
[193:06.96]Drop the polls.
[193:09.42]It's time to be president.
[193:12.11]Family values are caught in tryst with a, didn't read the rest, but almost Nader, you had your shot, it was close.
[193:19.78]The results from the emergency election are coming in.
[193:22.90]And it appears that former sitcom star Max has been elected president of the United States.
[193:28.64]In an unprecedented show of bipartisan solidarity, all of the country's political parties have desperately asked for a recount.
[193:35.71]Let's cut to the White House lawn to hear candidate Lincoln's address.
[193:39.54]No, no more hypnosis!
[193:56.82]Who cares?
[193:58.44]I'm the president of the US.
[194:02.06]Let's go bomb someone into oblivion.
[194:05.65]Not just anyone, Max.
[194:07.55]Abe Lincoln must die.
[194:10.19]Yes!
[194:12.83]Alright.
[194:14.45]Anything else here?
[194:15.13]I think we're good.
[194:16.37]Did we get anything else from that?
[194:22.46]No.
[194:25.50]So where did he go?
[194:32.32]They did the election the same day as the debate.
[194:35.16]And they only counted votes for like... 12 seconds.
[194:40.22]Hope you got yours in.
[194:41.06]Let's go see where he goes.
[194:56.00]Alright, shoot him.
[194:57.56]I can't shoot the guy?
[194:58.92]Okay.
[194:59.22]Well...
[195:27.74]Alright, Office or the White House.
[195:37.02]Um... I don't think I can do anything.
[195:41.50]Cut him off?
[195:43.18]And make him run into you?
[195:43.96]Oh, wait a minute, waitwaitwaitwaitwaitwaitwait.
[195:55.38]Sometimes it screws on quickly.
[196:02.14]Finally, Mr. President, you're here.
[196:04.74]That's the president?
[196:06.48]People will vote for anyone these days.
[196:09.60]Obviously.
[196:10.78]What's that supposed to mean?
[196:13.08]It means... Uh-oh.
[196:15.50]Political debate.
[196:17.48]From the Hamburglars, whatever their names are.
[196:20.62]Check out all the cool stuff on my new desk.
[196:28.08]Alright.
[196:28.64]He's the president now.
[196:29.28]Get out of the way.
[196:30.55]Step away from the door, sir.
[196:32.15]But we really want in there.
[196:33.91]Sorry, sir.
[196:34.67]I have orders to keep everyone out of the war room.
[196:37.17]Max is the president.
[196:38.49]Max.
[196:40.67]Tell him to let us in.
[196:42.43]Let's get the fuck in there.
[196:45.06]Can't you get us into the war room, Max?
[196:47.08]I kept hearing about presidential powers, but it's all just boring bureaucratic stuff.
[196:52.38]I was hoping I'd be able to make things explode with my mind.
[196:58.26]Let us open the door.
[197:01.42]What's the date today, Max?
[197:02.92]I'm president of the United States, Sam.
[197:04.98]What date do you want it to be?
[197:10.16]What are we doing here, Max?
[197:11.48]I keep getting whiny memos about the giant robotic Abraham Lincoln who's rampaging through Washington, enslaving the populace.
[197:18.63]I guess we'd better do something about that.
[197:21.73]I'm glad we took this time to talk, Max.
[197:23.73]Keep in touch, Sam.
[197:24.89]I mean that.
[197:31.98]There are so many other things to punch.
[197:35.82]What the hell?
[197:36.66]You weren't gonna let the president in the war room?
[197:38.82]Why?
[197:39.60]Look, Max.
[197:40.53]It's our old pal.
[197:42.87]Look, Grand Imperial Ward Lord Maximus Optimus, Keeper of the Seven Keys.
[197:47.27]It's our old pal, the former child star and embarrassing idol semifinalist, Peepers.
[197:51.95]Peepers?
[197:52.29]That former child star and embarrassing idol semifinalist, Governor Peepers.
[197:59.56]Uh, okay.
[198:01.43]What are you doing in here?
[198:02.19]What business do you have in the Oval Office?
[198:04.15]We need the president to settle custody of Mount Rushmore.
[198:08.25]Right.
[198:08.53]Max has the presidential pen.
[198:10.45]Somewhere.
[198:11.29]Just tell me where to sign.
[198:13.27]Great.
[198:13.91]The problem is solved.
[198:15.81]But seriously, if you guys see the president, tell him we're waiting.
[198:19.80]He's literally right.
[198:21.74]Yes, Max is the president.
[198:23.54]Turn around.
[198:24.10]It was in the papers.
[198:25.24]Politics and chat.
[198:26.08]We haven't been watching the news back in...
[198:32.18]I got under control.
[198:36.27]What was that?
[198:37.65]Did I say arms build up?
[198:39.95]I meant winter Paradise toboggan and scrapbooking jamboree.
[198:49.18]Can't we all just get along?
[198:50.38]Can't we all just get along?
[198:51.06]We can if we all just keep quiet and avoid another incident.
[198:54.62]Honesty is rarely the best policy.
[198:56.84]All us presidents know that.
[198:58.10]Alright.
[198:59.78]So long, people.
[199:00.20]See you later.
[199:02.82]Which one of you can pee?
[199:03.98]Can you pee on them or something?
[199:07.86]That's not funny.
[199:14.14]Thirsty?
[199:14.92]Yes!
[199:16.06]But you're not going to offer me a soda, are you?
[199:19.45]You know I can't resist them.
[199:21.93]We wouldn't do that.
[199:23.71]We've got, let's see here, orange soda, cola, grape soda, pop, some more orange soda, and tea.
[199:30.66]Tea, please.
[199:31.98]We're all out of tea.
[199:33.44]Soda?
[199:34.39]Why are you doing this?
[199:39.68]Why should your state get Mount Rushmore?
[199:41.66]Because they just want it for tourism.
[199:44.26]But my plan will save lives.
[199:47.04]It'll become a monument to soda abuse prevention.
[199:50.95]People will realize that just like Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and the other guy, they too can overcome their crippling addiction to carbonated beverages.
[200:02.41]George Washington never had a soda addiction.
[200:05.36]Why do you think he needed false teeth?
[200:10.58]Why not divide it up equally?
[200:12.14]That would never work.
[200:13.54]It's not even.
[200:14.90]You mean a lipstick break?
[200:17.00]I want the mustache.
[200:18.54]I wanted the mustache.
[200:20.82]Okay, Max gets Roosevelt's mustache.
[200:23.24]Max gets the glasses.
[200:24.46]Peepers, you get an ear and both nostrils.
[200:26.80]That just leaves me with the forehead.
[200:29.39]Alright then, Wizard.
[200:30.29]We'll throw in Crazy Horse, but that's my final offer.
[200:33.47]It's not even finished.
[200:35.47]This will never work.
[200:36.93]It's just like last time.
[200:40.15]It's called drip?
[200:42.69]Drip?
[200:46.13]No, it's called my head got stuck here and I rip-pulled too hard and I tripped and it fucking fell and it made the hole bigger.
[200:59.35]How did West Dakota become a separate state?
[201:01.45]The three of us ran for governor together.
[201:03.87]We got along so well during the campaign, and we were all such former TV celebrities that all three of us won.
[201:11.62]The voters realized they'd elected three governors for only two states.
[201:16.02]That's when the unpleasantness began.
[201:21.31]Uh, what unpleasantness?
[201:23.25]Let's just hear about it.
[201:24.65]We fought for a long time about how to divide up the states.
[201:28.60]There was almost a war!
[201:30.86]But we divided everything up fairly and all agreed that Mount Rushmore should be in the south.
[201:36.56]We did not!
[201:37.84]You!
[201:38.58]I what?
[201:39.72]You!
[201:40.96]Oh, never mind.
[201:42.37]Yes, I think there would be a fashion trend where this is really big.
[201:49.46]It's so stretched out to a point where it's stretched down to here.
[201:54.97]Here.
[201:55.63]It's floppy and all stretched out.
[202:07.83]Did somebody just say I look like I'm doing a shaggy cosplay?
[202:11.61]Am I making that up?
[202:12.61]I saw somebody say you look like shaggy right now.
[202:15.41]And I added the rest of that.
[202:24.83]I think I added that.
[202:27.15]But this is a shaggy cosplay.
[202:31.15]Oh, I can't wait, Scoob.
[202:33.13]Oh, God.
[202:35.53]Zoids, man.
[202:36.37]Oh, I mean, I don't think we should go in there, Scoob.
[202:45.12]I'm fucking changing my clothes.
[205:14.54]Alright.
[205:17.44]So.
[205:22.50]It's another green shirt!
[205:32.48]I'm so fucking stupid.
[205:36.06]Hey, hey, what, what, hey!
[205:38.55]What?
[205:41.70]This just has like 44 grams of sugar in it!
[205:50.31]Oh!
[205:51.87]What the fuck is happening in my life?!
[205:53.69]Oh my god, it's gross!
[205:59.86]Alright, what are we doing?
[206:07.22]What was the unpleasantness again?
[206:08.82]We almost went to war over who should get control of Mount Rushmore.
[206:13.02]And it's all cause specs and peepers.
[206:15.72]What?
[206:16.66]Yeah, what?
[206:18.32]You... Oh, never mind.
[206:22.34]Okay.
[206:24.15]Stay dry, Wiz-Man.
[206:29.51]Raggy!
[206:30.91]No, that's the wrong character.
[206:33.17]You're thinking of a different character.
[206:36.25]Can somebody open this door?
[206:37.57]Can you see that?
[206:43.23]44 fucking grams of sugar.
[207:06.19]That's unbelievable.
[207:08.47]This should be illegal.
[207:15.32]You could clean a drain with that.
[207:19.34]It is illegal.
[207:40.08]That's better.
[207:56.26]What?! !
[208:04.67]If it makes you feel better, you were never really that beloved.
[208:07.29]Don't- I don't wanna fuck this one up.
[208:08.11]I always watched your show with detached iron.
[208:13.89]What business do you have with the president?
[208:15.85]We're here to get federal resolution on a dispute.
[208:19.16]It wouldn't be a dispute if you- If I what?
[208:22.56]Nothing.
[208:23.56]Awkward.
[208:26.36]Alright.
[208:26.70]Break down this door!
[208:30.39]Before I continue to do shaggy impressions.
[208:35.68]What about the rat hole?
[208:36.84]Looks like there are rats in the Oval Office.
[208:39.78]Sam, you've finally done it.
[208:41.46]A straight line's so easy, even I won't touch it.
[208:49.34]Stand aside, pal.
[208:50.47]The president needs to get into the war room.
[208:52.59]Get me in there.
[208:54.47]Perhaps you didn't hear our advisor.
[208:56.53]We would like to see our war room.
[208:58.79]No can do, sir.
[208:59.81]Orders.
[209:03.30]max says you can take a vacation we will make an exception just this once thank you sir but no can do I can only take a vacation on federal holidays oh we'll be back Roger that wasn't that interesting I've got a calendar right here it's the official united states calendar 12 of the hottest supreme court justices in their skimpiest naughtiest swimsuits even better max you can actually change the official date let's change it
[209:32.39]Today, uh, so, we have Earth Day, Secretary's Day, Arbor Day, the beginning of Passover, Easter Sunday!
[209:39.49]Alright, so, what's, uh, Easter Sunday, right?
[209:44.89]Make it 420.
[209:45.81]No.
[209:51.24]National Chicago Hot Dog Day.
[209:54.58]Hold on a minute here, folks.
[209:55.76]I'm gonna drink a fuckin' real man's drink.
[210:01.23]That's right.
[210:02.89]This is the one for the ages here.
[210:12.71]This is a 100% no sugar added ocean spray pineapple juice.
[210:16.64]It's good shit.
[210:17.56]That's it.
[210:17.90]It was man's drink.
[210:18.60]It's a... Who the fuck are you?
[210:20.14]Man, woman, doesn't matter.
[210:25.54]Liver damage?
[210:25.96]What do you mean liver damage?
[210:26.64]What are you talking about?
[210:35.80]What does that mean?
[210:39.44]Why did you say liver damage?
[210:41.38]I'm serious.
[210:41.94]I'm not fucking around right now.
[210:43.62]Cut the music.
[210:44.16]What are you talking about?
[210:58.43]Worse than alcohol.
[211:00.30]What are you talking about?
[211:01.14]This has not that much sugar in it.
[211:05.42]It's just fruit juice.
[211:08.92]Is this going to hurt me?
[211:12.88]Google it.
[211:13.26]It's real.
[211:13.82]Pineapple juice is bad for your liver?
[211:18.27]It burns through organs.
[211:20.97]It does not do that.
[211:22.01]I drink this on airplanes.
[211:23.81]It's my favorite.
[211:24.41]That's why I bought like a hundred of them.
[211:26.35]I bought a lot of these.
[211:30.41]I bought like cases of these.
[211:35.57]I used to drink them on airplanes and I loved it.
[211:42.50]Well, Kermit the Frog says something irrelevant and that's just my opinion.
[211:47.78]You know, he's green too.
[211:51.85]It's not actually going to be bad, right?
[211:57.29]I don't believe you guys.
[211:59.33]I'll ask a fucking real doctor.
[212:04.59]Cue the music.
[212:08.69]Look how much sugar it has.
[212:11.76]18!
[212:11.80]That's nothing!
[212:13.58]I don't drink like 10 of these, I drink like one of these every few days to get a little pep.
[212:21.26]Alright, excuse me.
[212:23.50]Full screen this shit, because I know if Stalling played the game, this is important.
[212:30.93]Okay guys, so in my, in my, your right, on your right, my left, we have a fucking Mountain Dew.
[212:40.07]Mountain Dew, drink it every day.
[212:41.91]People drink a soda, five sodas a day, 44 grams of sugar.
[212:45.89]In my right hand, I have a pineapple juice.
[212:48.47]It's ocean spray, it's fine, it's small.
[212:51.55]You drink one or two of these every week.
[212:54.57]You're telling me that I'm doing something wrong here when I'm cutting out like 25 grams of sugar instead of drinking this.
[213:01.61]Look at the difference.
[213:02.91]You can put this over ice.
[213:07.30]What kind of hipster Mountain Dew is this?
[213:09.58]It's the shitty one that has extra sugar in it because for some reason people wanted that.
[213:16.97]Ocean spray is nasty.
[213:18.57]It's really cheap.
[213:20.45]How much is it?
[213:21.21]Go look it up on Amazon right now.
[213:22.77]How much is like a fucking case of this shit?
[213:25.19]It's probably like the cost of two Mountain Dews.
[213:28.72]For the cost of two
[213:35.48]Mountain Dews.
[213:37.40]You can get yourself like 30 pineapple juices.
[213:49.74]Oh no, he's a puppet.
[213:55.63]Shaggy is high as fuck.
[214:02.67]I drink a ton of water.
[214:04.55]But sometimes you want a little drink.
[214:08.66]You don't know the fucked up shit that people drink, man.
[214:10.68]I see people order.
[214:11.54]I see people walking around the street with these jumbo, giant cans of fucking Monster.
[214:18.93]Those have like 900 grams of sugar in it.
[214:21.15]We sweating?
[214:21.81]We're fine.
[214:22.25]Oh, boy.
[214:28.26]We now declare today April 8th, Easter Sunday.
[214:31.84]Christ, we'd better start hiding eggs on the White House lawn.
[214:35.48]Already did it, Sam.
[214:36.89]Max, are these the eggs that are made of metal and shaped like a pineapple and have a pin in them?
[214:42.97]Don't be silly, Sam.
[214:44.49]I took the pins out first.
[214:47.85]Alright, it's Easter Sunday.
[214:48.87]Go home.
[214:50.55]Hey, Supes.
[214:52.85]Max says you can take a vacation.
[214:54.65]It's Easter.
[214:55.75]I'm not a religious man, sir.
[214:57.13]I wouldn't feel right taking a vacation unless it was a secular holiday.
[215:03.05]Doesn't want the day off on Easter.
[215:05.31]But you get day off.
[215:06.31]Who cares?
[215:09.17]We'll be back.
[215:10.15]Roger that.
[215:13.37]Oh, boy!
[215:15.01]Not a federal holiday.
[215:16.05]I don't even know which one of these is a federal holiday.
[215:23.09]No, these are really, uh, uh, Arbor Day, Secretary's Day, Earth Day, Arbor Day.
[215:29.51]We now declare today April 27th, Arbor Day.
[215:32.75]No, Arbor Day's not a... Everybody go outside today and hug a tree.
[215:36.03]Hug nothing?
[215:37.31]This year I'm hoping to get to second base.
[215:41.09]Oh boy!
[215:45.15]People of Earth, we have now changed the official date.
[215:48.77]Mark your calendars, update your checks.
[215:50.95]All hail Max.
[215:53.29]No, they don't even say it.
[215:54.37]It's not even gonna work.
[215:55.75]Only the red ones.
[215:57.55]Alright, go home.
[216:05.33]Plant a tree.
[216:06.89]Nice liver hurts.
[216:12.08]My fucking liver hurts, I think.
[216:13.62]You guys have gotten in my head.
[216:15.28]It's the acid that I drank before this.
[216:16.98]I've been drinking these for years.

[216:57.16]What day does it need to be?
[216:59.74]Earth Day?
[217:00.30]We now declare today April 22nd, Earth Day.
[217:03.84]People of America, take this day to ignore all practical concerns and devote all your attention to one day of crackpot extreme environmentalist activism, which you'll forget about for the rest of the year.
[217:14.39]People of Berkeley, California, keep up the good work.
[217:18.47]You convinced me to start drinking.
[217:20.19]Don't say that.
[217:21.69]It's not... Don't make... Don't put me there.
[217:23.77]Very funny, sir.
[217:25.78]Roger that.
[217:26.08]Um... Can I change the... I did them all.
[217:48.71]Passover?
[217:49.21]April Fools?
[217:51.01]I swear to God I'm not making this up.
[217:52.07]I really wish I was.
[217:52.67]It definitely wasn't pineapple juice.
[217:53.85]It was this acid that I took two sips out of.
[217:55.31]I got a stomach ache now.
[218:18.50]Max says you can take a vacation.
[218:20.26]It's April Fool's Day.
[218:21.74]With all due respect, that's kind of mean, sir.
[218:25.78]We'll be back.
[218:26.86]Roger that.
[218:31.70]Quick, eat chalk.
[218:33.78]I gotta counteract the acid.
[218:35.66]I gotta eat, like... The soda poppers aren't the close-knit band they used to be.
[218:42.31]They're just one inappropriate comment away from full-on violence.
[218:46.33]Just like you and me, pal.
[218:51.18]I'm gonna do Passover.
[218:53.82]Didn't he say not a religious holiday?
[218:55.90]It's the only other one I can do.
[219:00.26]May the 1st... May the 4th?
[219:01.40]May the 4th be with you.
[219:14.28]Max says you can take a vacation.
[219:16.11]It's Passover.
[219:17.23]I'm not a religious man, sir.
[219:18.63]I wouldn't feel right taking a vacation unless it was a secular holiday.
[219:23.74]We'll be back.
[219:24.42]Roger that.
[219:28.36]Oh, boy!
[219:40.27]People of Earth, we have now changed the official date.
[219:43.91]Mark your calendars.
[219:44.85]Update your checks.
[219:46.05]All hail Max.
[219:50.81]Hey, Supes.
[219:52.75]Max says you can take a vacation.
[219:54.49]I can only take a vacation on federal holidays.
[219:59.07]There's no other holiday to pick.
[220:01.63]I have to write something up there.
[220:06.15]Oh, boy.
[220:07.11]Tax day?
[220:08.08]April 15th?
[220:08.42]No.
[220:12.50]We now declare today, April 15th, Tax Day.
[220:16.10]When writing your checks, America, remember it's spelled M-A-X.
[220:20.79]Bad news, little pal.
[220:21.63]This has to be it.
[220:22.23]The last president abolished the income tax.
[220:24.61]Replaced it with a national door-to-door candy bar sale, remember?
[220:27.91]The fiend.
[220:28.97]I'm glad we knocked his head off.
[220:32.09]It's Tax Day.
[220:33.07]Go home.
[220:33.75]Hey, Supes.
[220:35.59]Max says you can take a vacation.
[220:37.31]I can only take a vacation on federal holidays.
[220:41.16]Federal holidays.
[221:12.47]There's no federal holiday in April.
[221:17.11]There's no federal holiday in April.
[221:21.77]There isn't one.
[221:40.39]Can I...
[221:43.08]Can I turn the page?
[221:50.07]Mark your calendars.
[221:50.93]Update your checks.
[221:54.06]It's the Secretary of Presidential Whimsy Ribbon.
[221:56.84]Looks like Max can use this to appoint someone as an Honorary Cabinet Secretary.
[222:00.62]Oh, give it to him, give it to him, give it to him, give it to him, give it to him.
[222:04.13]Here, here, take it.
[222:05.29]You're a Secretary of State now.
[222:07.55]Take it.

[222:14.43]Better get those handkerchiefs ready.

[222:17.83]Agent Superball.
[222:19.01]We have decided to reward you for your excellent service to your country.
[222:22.75]For your unwavering commitment to preventing us from being where we most desperately needed to be.
[222:27.61]For your unerring devotion to being a constant hindrance in our task.
[222:32.17]For all these things and more, we now dub thee Superball.

[222:40.17]Secretary in charge of guarding the war room door.
[222:42.35]Secretary of the Interior.

[223:14.27]Now run along to my cabinet meeting.
[223:16.45]I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.
[223:18.23]You've got to be kidding me.
[223:20.12]I still have my orders.
[223:22.70]Oh, these.
[223:23.42]What's in there?
[223:27.64]Oh, no.

[223:52.31]Time to go home.
[223:54.55]That's supposed to be Administrative Professionals Day.
[223:57.85]We already heard this.
[224:00.01]I didn't want to take it off of him.
[224:07.34]That was fun!
[224:15.28]Hey, Supes.
[224:19.24]We'll be back.

[224:42.11]Hey, Supes.
[224:44.88]Today is Secretary's Day.
[224:46.38]You have to take the day off.
[224:47.76]It was only a secretary for five seconds.
[224:49.54]A vacation.
[224:50.48]Permission to weep openly, sir.
[224:52.18]Not just granted, but encouraged.
[224:54.58]The forces of bureaucracy win again.
[224:56.78]War room.
[224:57.66]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[224:58.30]War room.
[225:00.69]I think the war room door is only openable in time of war.
[225:04.11]Stupid old piece.
[225:08.11]Okay, so Max, let's do some war.
[225:10.39]War.
[225:15.01]Can't you get us into the war room, Max?
[225:17.14]I kept hearing about presidential powers, but it's all just boring bureaucratic stuff.
[225:22.46]I was hoping I'd be able to make things explode with my mind.
[225:29.85]Can I move the thing to date of war?
[225:35.07]I'm glad we... Keep in touch.
[225:36.43]Do they have to break out in a fight or something?
[225:41.63]Hey, Peepers.
[225:44.25]yeah these had they have to break out in like a war between each other
[225:50.39]You're a governor too?
[225:51.65]That's right!
[225:52.65]I got North Dakota!
[225:54.55]North Dakota!
[225:55.59]The leftover state!
[225:56.97]Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[225:58.43]North Dakota!
[225:59.43]Fine people of North Dakota don't find that funny.
[226:02.01]Hey, be nice!
[226:03.25]We've got a rich and varied history!
[226:06.21]North Dakota!

[226:13.37]Hey!
[226:14.57]Sorry, I got caught up in the moment.
[226:20.39]What's there to do in North Dakota?
[226:21.97]What can you do there?
[226:22.87]Plenty.
[226:23.15]Snowmen, snow angels, snow forts, snowball fights, homemade ice cream, and, of course, the majesty of Mount Rushmore.
[226:30.87]That hasn't been decided yet.
[226:33.13]Right.
[226:33.66]I spoke too soon.
[226:36.60]See you later.
[226:37.34]Alright.
[226:40.80]War.
[226:43.62]Would you like a drink?
[226:44.76]As long as it's not soda.
[226:49.10]What was the unpleasantness again?
[226:50.82]We almost went to war over who should get control of Mount Rushmore.
[226:54.98]It's all because of Specs.
[226:56.00]Specs and Peepers?
[226:57.66]What?
[226:58.58]Yeah, what?
[227:00.27]You?
[227:01.49]Oh, never mind.
[227:03.53]So, roll punch.
[227:06.21]Hey, Specs.
[227:10.27]What business do you have with the president?
[227:12.29]We're here to get federal resolution on a dispute.
[227:15.57]It wouldn't be a dispute if you... If I what?
[227:18.96]Nothing.
[227:22.82]Well, they won't talk.
[227:24.16]They won't... talk.
[227:30.36]If only there was a device that I had that made people tell the truth.
[227:39.13]Max, I need $100 million right now.
[227:53.12]That was too much eye contact, it was just enough.
[227:58.42]I probably have to go get like a royal decree or something.
[228:03.65]He was reading chat, that's how he figured it out.
[228:05.19]Okay.
[228:11.41]Alright.
[228:13.61]Can I ask you where you're from?
[228:15.45]Probably fucking North Dakota.
[228:19.05]I would be surprised if you weren't.
[228:28.16]We're going to the office so I can go buy something.
[228:33.19]Everyone's saying blind, blind, blind.
[228:36.93]Where the fuck are y'all from?
[228:41.01]Blind?
[228:41.43]What did I miss?
[228:43.86]Was it like a pack of money on the table or something?
[228:49.96]He's blind.
[228:50.46]He's blind.
[228:50.92]He's blind.
[228:51.38]He's blind.
[228:51.82]He's blind.
[228:52.60]Blind.
[228:53.88]Blind somehow.
[228:55.14]Blind.
[228:55.94]He's blind.
[228:59.05]But what is he supposed to be seeing?
[229:02.93]A suitcase full of money.
[229:06.49]Cash.
[229:08.01]Credit cards.
[229:09.87]Money.
[229:11.33]The globe.
[229:11.89]Receipts.
[229:24.97]A national budget!
[229:25.79]Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!
[229:26.95]Hold on!
[229:27.13]Uh, presidential discretionary budget.
[229:28.51]The Alamo Statue of Liberty Independence Hall.
[229:29.87]Uh, what?
[229:30.07]That's not what I clicked.
[229:56.94]Well, what did he want?
[230:07.92]Did Bosco say something earlier about... I don't remember him saying any of this stuff.
[230:13.16]He's like pretending to be a Russian guy, right?
[230:19.02]Is he gonna put the money there and I have to go get it?
[230:22.76]I would assume.
[230:31.55]It just deposits the money to, like, the Statue of Liberty, and I have to walk into it and grab it?
[230:35.55]I don't know.
[230:51.80]Let's go back to town.
[230:58.95]Oh, hey there, little buddy.
[230:59.81]Where are we going, Sam?
[231:02.71]Back to the office.
[231:03.67]Shotgun!
[231:03.93]I love these little cans.
[231:13.38]Don't tell anybody on the internet what you're drinking or eating.
[231:15.98]Some of them always have a problem with it.
[231:17.72]Whee!
[231:21.04]I could be eating an apple on stream.
[231:23.96]Just like a Washington apple.
[231:26.20]And somebody would be like, hey, you know, that's bad for you.
[231:28.80]It's like, it's an apple.
[231:31.02]Don't eat those.
[231:31.74]Don't eat those.
[231:32.14]They got poisoning in them.
[231:35.32]Okay.
[231:40.66]I could be smoking a cigarette on stream and people would have less to say about it.
[231:44.64]Than if I ate like a pear.
[231:53.63]Alright, we're going in here.
[231:55.23]I want to ask him something.
[232:01.45]Apples destroy your kidneys.
[232:02.75]Oh, Mr. President!
[232:03.55]Please do not execute me.
[232:08.41]Imagine if I turned on the facecam and I was smoking.
[232:12.31]I would not do that.
[232:14.65]No.
[232:17.77]We want to buy something.
[232:19.15]Just like a cigarette hanging out of my hand?
[232:20.97]No.
[232:21.55]Unless it was a very specific character or something that we were doing.
[232:27.53]We'll take that truth serum.
[232:29.21]is yours for only 100 million American dollars.
[232:32.70]I seem to have left my 100 million dollars in my other suit.
[232:35.22]I don't smoke cigarettes.
[232:37.60]Alright, let's go back to, uh, talk to Zim.
[232:46.47]Do I have any cigarettes?
[232:47.71]No, I don't have any cigarettes.
[232:50.51]I don't purchase cigarettes.
[232:51.67]I don't own cigarettes.
[232:53.87]I'm sorry.
[233:01.15]Why am I dumb for that?
[233:04.87]Why would that make me a dumbass?
[233:07.95]You take up smoking?
[233:08.99]What a dumbass.
[233:11.01]Improves your IQ.
[233:25.12]Hiya, Sybil.
[233:26.10]How are things in the world of computer-generated romance?
[233:29.20]Oh, I'm not doing that anymore.
[233:31.23]You believe that guy?
[233:32.51]Never mentioning that he was married?
[233:34.51]Men are such self-centered jerks.
[233:36.07]Dick.
[233:36.67]Preach it, girlfriend!
[233:38.49]So you changed careers again?
[233:39.56]Yeah.
[233:40.64]Now I'm running a dating service.
[233:42.97]A carbon dating service.
[233:46.35]I bought this astoundingly useful machine that tells me how old things are.
[233:51.29]I usually just cut them in half and count the rings.
[233:53.83]There's a reason you're not invited to birthday parties anymore.
[233:56.49]I wanted a fresh start in a new career to get my mind off that fiasco with Honest Abe.
[234:02.81]This wasn't my first choice, but I got a good deal on the carbon dating equipment online, and I couldn't afford to change my signs.
[234:12.65]You're having financial problems.
[234:13.45]You're having financial problems?
[234:15.10]I'm afraid so.
[234:16.44]After my public humiliation with Lincoln, all the applicants for my dating service demanded their money back.
[234:22.16]I can't believe it.
[234:22.72]Not to mention all the money tied up in pending litigation with the clients who watched Max's dating video.
[234:28.86]I stated very clearly up front that viewer discretion was advised.
[234:32.86]Believe me, I would love to just close up shop for a while and take a vacation.
[234:37.32]I did like the Elon Musk smoking face.
[234:40.50]I know I did.
[234:41.08]I could feel it.
[234:41.74]I could see it.
[234:42.46]But unless I get a major windfall, I have to hope the carbon dating business takes off.
[234:50.86]Carbon dating, I spit.
[234:52.38]You probably saw it.
[234:53.02]How does carbon dating work?
[234:54.54]I don't know.
[234:55.20]Something about carbon 14 and half-lives and radiation.
[234:58.98]I'm impressed with your detailed scientific knowledge.
[235:01.72]Very professional.
[235:03.16]That's the beauty of it.
[235:04.70]I don't really need to know anything.
[235:06.58]I just aim my little machine at something and it tells me how old it is.
[235:10.92]Allow me to demonstrate.
[235:12.64]This tiki is... Oh my gosh!
[235:14.44]It's 2,000 years old!
[235:15.18]This is fantastic!
[235:18.95]Can we borrow your carbon dating machine?
[235:20.87]Now you need a grant.
[235:21.87]Okay.
[235:22.03]Okay.
[235:48.02]so uh we need to give you a grant so what is this place called did she say that it's sybil's carbon dating don't touch that fellas it's the only thing keeping me in business do we get an extra thing notch or is it just one of those places stature liberty or
[236:19.64]So there's going to be another spot will be there for her place.
[236:24.89]Okay.
[236:25.95]Alright, so we're going to do that, then take the gun.
[236:28.09]It's locked.
[236:29.73]It's locked.
[236:30.83]Oh my god, I fucking cannot believe it.
[236:33.28]It's going to happen every time.
[236:34.66]It'll happen every single time.
[236:37.98]I swear to god that's never going to not happen.
[236:49.81]They could do studies on my absent-mindedness.
[236:52.85]They really could.
[236:53.75]In fact, they probably already have.
[236:55.05]This is me, your mother, and your father worried.
[236:59.85]We heard something about cigarettes on your stream.
[237:01.51]We aren't sure what it's about, but we really hope you haven't picked up smoking.
[237:04.55]It's very bad for you, and it can give you cancer.
[237:06.45]Will you fly over there and take away your electronic toys and ground you?
[237:09.04]If you don't stop.
[237:22.25]Where are we going?
[237:25.19]We're off to the White House.
[237:26.75]Oh, boy!
[237:30.81]Mom's not gonna take my toys.
[237:36.41]Now he's gonna take another week vacation.
[237:40.09]Nah.

[237:46.13]After Sam & Max.
[237:46.77]Wait, what's today?
[237:47.91]Today we have, um...
[237:55.89]It's May 1st, 2nd.
[237:57.51]Okay.
[237:58.69]I'm gonna block out the rest of the weekend here.
[238:04.09]Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[238:06.29]Alright, so here's the plan for the week.
[238:07.59]You ready?
[238:09.03]Put your ear to the TV.
[238:12.64]So, after tonight, we're gonna play... I'm just gonna do this until we finish it.
[238:17.40]So, after tonight, I will be back on Saturday and Sunday.
[238:23.64]We'll go five days this week.
[238:27.83]And then... So that would be... Yeah, Labo VR will be on Saturday.
[238:34.23]And maybe even into Sunday.
[238:35.35]Who knows?
[238:41.19]Maybe I might play Mordhau again.
[238:42.39]I had a lot of fun playing that.
[238:47.91]So yeah, after tonight, however long this takes us, we're going to just hang out and chill and just keep doing it.
[238:55.42]And then during the next two days, I'm going to spend a lot of time in Dreams.
[239:02.21]So I'm going to really, really, really hunker down on it and try to get something fun because it takes a lot of work.
[239:08.77]So Dreams will come back next week.
[239:13.74]And I'm not going to give a date for anybody to... Oh, hey, hey, hey, you have to have a certain deadline by the time.
[239:21.00]No.
[239:22.24]I think I'd rather...
[239:25.11]Because I don't want to put pressure on anybody to get something done by next week or something, so... I'll check and see if anybody has anything there.
[239:38.44]But yeah, Labo VR will be Saturday.
[239:41.04]Don't worry, I'll get a fucking box of wine and I'll fill it with pineapple juice and pretend to drink.
[239:50.33]that that's a good plan because we did Monday Tuesday Wednesday Saturday Sunday will be what we do so that's the plan for this week just wanted to try to block it out in my brain so but let's keep going sam max is fun let's keep doing it okay so now we can go in the book
[240:14.62]and what this should do.
[240:15.46]Yeah, there is Sybil.
[240:15.86]Sybil's office.
[240:16.34]She's got the money.
[240:17.40]Now let's go get the gun.
[240:18.06]What was the plan I spaced out?
[240:19.08]I'm gonna finish Sam and Max tonight, however long this takes.
[240:39.63]So it's been about four hours.
[240:41.97]We got two episodes left.
[240:43.07]Each one is supposed to be like one and a half to two hours each, so... It'll be about probably seven or eight hours tonight.
[240:54.74]Where are we going, Sam?
[240:57.20]Uh, back to the office.
[240:57.82]Back to the office.
[240:58.84]Shotgun!
[241:03.66]You spent four hours in one episode.
[241:05.18]That's not true.
[241:06.72]Uh, we did half of episode three.
[241:11.95]But actually, it was a little less than half.
[241:14.61]I was like 30-40% into episode 3 when we started tonight's stream.
[241:20.91]This episode is hard, to be fair.
[241:24.83]It just kind of seems longer.
[241:35.88]And yeah, I know, it's because I've been doing a lot of... I'm in high energy tonight, so sometimes you get that.
[241:42.19]I can't control it.
[241:43.69]It's Dr. Jerma and Mr. Elbertson.
[241:46.73]I don't know who you're gonna get.
[241:48.39]It's rough.
[241:48.85]She's probably living it up on some tropical island on the taxpayer's dime.
[241:52.64]I bet she's getting abducted in some sleazy nightclub, then sold into a white slavery ring, forced to do unspeakable things for a power-mad despot, before narrowly escaping his volcano-top lair with only one of her kidneys left.
[242:05.06]don't be such a pessimist max sorry sam it's just no fair we're stuck here working and she gets to have all the fun okay well uh so give me the gun it's sybil's carbon dating machine and I'm gonna take it it's mine now that's my carbon dating machine stupid not you him alright so now I can I can date something
[242:32.75]I'm not going over to click on the door like to leave the office.
[242:34.99]I just wanted to click on carbon date stuff.
[242:39.44]Garfield.
[242:40.14]So now I gotta take this and bring it... What do I need to know the carbon date of?
[242:59.59]Let's go.
[243:02.11]The car.
[243:02.95]How old is the car?
[243:06.11]I don't want to know how old that is.
[243:07.83]Do you not know what make and model your car is?
[243:12.42]Come on, man.
[243:16.76]Is it on max?
[243:21.02]Max, have you been dieting?
[243:24.83]He's timeless?
[243:25.59]I don't get it.
[243:25.99]What does that mean?
[243:29.92]Turn it on you and find out what the carbon date for yourself is.
[243:32.16]Hold on.
[243:39.53]Okay.
[243:39.95]Well, fine.
[243:40.69]What about you in here, Bosco?
[243:42.67]How you doing?
[243:59.26]Carbondate yourself.
[244:00.18]I'm spitting a lot.
[244:01.05]Let's go to the dentist.
[244:11.43]Well...
[244:33.01]We want to buy something.
[244:34.03]Oh, we're going to do this thing again, right?
[244:39.27]I'm not sticking them up.
[244:41.29]It's a glorified tag scanner.
[244:44.89]Do you have any potatoes in the likeness of Catholic saints?
[244:47.95]Nyet.
[244:50.16]Do you have any souvenir snow globes from the mystery vortex?
[244:53.58]Nyet.
[244:55.62]Do you have any lobster farts brand cereal?
[244:58.08]Nyet.
[244:58.84]Lobster farts?
[245:01.34]Why was that like a Boston accent?
[245:02.30]Do you have any Tagalog rhyming dictionaries abridged?
[245:04.46]Nyet.
[245:07.20]Do you have any wiener cozies?
[245:08.88]Da.
[245:09.56]We just get shipment of those in this week.
[245:12.18]Let me look.
[245:13.50]Oh, boy.
[245:14.64]Wait.
[245:15.26]Did you say wiener cozies?
[245:17.45]I thought you said Navajo blankets.
[245:19.73]No, we're all out of wiener cozies.
[245:23.01]Do you have any Navajo blankets?
[245:24.57]Nyet.
[245:27.14]Alright.
[245:27.64]Let's continue scanning.
[245:28.66]How old's the trash?
[245:30.90]How old's the magazine?
[245:31.54]Well, no, that's Max.
[245:34.38]Weenies.
[245:50.10]Well, Bosco, by my readings, these weenies date from the early Cretaceous period.
[245:55.55]Uh, dah!
[245:56.47]Special bargain for you.
[245:58.49]Still tasty, half of today only.
[246:00.85]Shut him down.
[246:01.13]You don't understand.
[246:02.19]Your store is now a national historic place.
[246:05.05]These weenies are valuable artifacts.
[246:06.47]Oh, because they're, OK.
[246:07.47]Really?
[246:08.03]I mean, of course.
[246:09.99]In preserving heritage of my peoples.
[246:12.77]Just how valuable are we talking about here?
[246:15.69]We'll get back to you on that.
[246:16.85]$100 million is what it is.
[246:21.96]Well, Simpsons knockoff.
[246:23.28]Did they Simpsons do a scan your age joke?
[246:30.73]I want a hot dog so fucking bad.
[246:33.01]It's making me angry.
[246:33.89]The nachos are from the early 90s, but I can't get a reading on the cheese.
[246:37.99]I don't think it's organic, Sam.
[246:39.45]Alright, I want to know how old the coffee is.
[246:43.13]I've been talking about how gross and green it is.
[246:47.73]This coffee is over a month old.
[246:49.83]It's slow roasted for premium taste and maximum viscosity.
[246:53.77]I need a hot dog.
[246:54.81]How do I get one?
[246:55.37]I should have just told Kim to get hot dogs at the grocery store.
[247:04.52]What did I say?
[247:05.26]PBR.
[247:05.92]I was making dumb jokes.
[247:12.40]Shit.
[247:16.93]Alright, let's go allocate the money.
[247:19.03]Come back and get the device from him.
[247:26.62]Call... I think... I think she's here.
[247:30.96]That was almost two... That was like two hours ago.
[247:36.53]You don't go to the grocery store for two and a half hours.
[247:40.41]Unless you're really buying a lot of shit for a lot of fucking people.
[247:45.23]We're off to the White House.
[247:46.79]Oh, boy!
[247:52.36]Two-hour-old moldy hot dogs.
[247:58.30]Okay.
[247:59.78]Budget.
[248:00.98]Let's sign the paper.
[248:06.81]Mm-mm-mm-mm.
[248:13.96]That'll give us the truth serum.
[248:15.04]We can get what we want out of these McNugget kids.
[248:20.56]What are they called?
[248:21.28]The Soda Pockers.
[248:21.74]Here we go.
[248:22.08]Bosco's Inconvenience Store has $100 million now.
[248:23.69]Let's go get it.
[248:39.45]The soda poppers.
[248:40.64]Hi, America.
[248:41.56]I didn't see you there.
[248:42.94]As you know, I'm Maximilian I, ruler of your quaint little nation.
[248:47.70]Our borders stretch from the beautiful coasts of California to the not exactly beautiful, but still pretty nice in their own way, coasts along the eastern seaboard.
[248:56.72]At least they do now.
[248:58.22]I'm working with my executive staff, Sam, to see about getting us a little more room to work with, if you catch my drift.
[249:05.92]But don't you worry your pretty little heads about that.
[249:08.84]For now, just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.
[249:12.39]Toodles!
[249:15.87]Why is- I'm not even gonna read what you just said.
[249:21.71]You just robbed Sibyl, you pulled all her funding.
[249:23.77]She had enough money to do, at least, to get some stuff done.
[249:32.86]True serum.
[249:33.56]Where are we going?
[249:34.78]We are going back to the office.
[249:36.62]Back to the office.
[249:37.54]SHOTGUN!
[249:41.78]Why is- ah, my fucking god, my brain is wired just to- There's a lot of goddamn filler?
[249:59.43]Nah, it's not bad.
[250:03.13]I mean, look, this is episode four.
[250:04.40]We're gonna have a filler episode here at some point.
[250:07.50]They all can't be home runs.
[250:09.50]They're all good.
[250:12.66]Hello, comrade Bosco.
[250:14.41]Hail to the chief!
[250:16.30]I don't know how you guys did it, but I just got a huge check from the government.
[250:20.90]You earned it, Bosco.
[250:22.17]It's not easy to perfectly preserve weenies that predate the discovery of fire.
[250:26.01]Not to mention the teeming microcosm growing in the bathroom.
[250:28.91]We're considering making it a national wildlife preserve.
[250:31.97]Now I can finally finish my satellite defense system.
[250:36.21]So we can have the truth serum?
[250:38.69]Vodka.
[250:38.95]I told you.
[250:39.23]You told me I was wrong!
[250:39.83]All you guys said it wasn't what it was!
[250:42.11]People told me I was wrong.
[250:42.89]Alright, let's go get the soda poppers drunk.
[250:44.56]We believe we didn't.
[251:07.91]Go to Sybil and see... She's going to be mad that I pulled all of her funding.
[251:17.78]Funding.
[251:18.80]How does funding work?
[251:19.82]Somebody gives you money and you make something and you pay them back?
[251:22.76]Wow.
[251:24.67]So I'm coming to collect.
[251:28.81]That's what we're doing here.
[251:40.89]It's locked.
[251:41.87]She's not in here.
[251:43.51]Nothing useful in here.
[251:53.64]That's not even.
[251:54.34]Do you hear like moaning?
[252:26.52]That's the fan?
[252:29.26]She's not in here.
[252:35.82]Stop telling me to relax.
[252:37.88]I just want a hot dog.
[252:39.82]I want two hot dogs.
[252:41.86]I know you don't like when I look at you like this.
[252:43.76]I just startle myself, but I want two hot dogs.
[252:45.96]Alright, let's go.
[252:56.18]I might even eat three hot dogs tonight.
[252:59.54]That's right.
[253:00.56]You're eating a hot dog right now?
[253:07.37]I'm so jealous, I really am.
[253:12.77]Three hot dogs.
[253:14.11]But one of them without a bun.
[253:15.68]That's how you can tell that I'm being responsible about the whole thing.
[253:26.31]Watch out, get out of my way!
[253:27.69]Okay, let's... Yeah, I usually do one bun and one without bun.
[253:33.71]And the one without the bun just gets, like, a little squeeze of, uh, mustard on it, and I eat it with a fork and knife.
[253:39.54]The other one is eaten loaded up with a bunch of bullshit.
[253:44.18]Alright, guys, let's have a little party here.
[253:50.20]Care for a drink?
[253:51.46]Thanks, but I'm not thirsty.
[253:54.09]Do you put condiments on top or underneath?
[253:57.23]I put it on top.
[253:58.58]I like the aesthetic.
[253:59.50]It's pleasing to me.
[254:01.34]Underneath, it kind of sogs in and gets wet.
[254:03.84]I like the artwork.
[254:09.90]What are you guys doing?
[254:10.50]This is old.
[254:17.74]We've seen this already.
[254:20.83]I wish that was me.
[254:22.47]God, I wish that was me.
[254:40.41]I'm imagining how good that would be right now.
[254:43.75]I'm just thinking about it.
[254:45.25]I'm picturing that hot dog where it is right now.
[254:51.83]It's glorious.
[254:57.44]Nice.
[254:59.38]Really nice.
[255:01.30]Mmm.
[255:02.10]Dijon, too.
[255:05.40]Mmm.
[255:08.48]Alright, let's go.
[255:12.01]You would know immediately.
[255:13.43]Whoa!
[255:13.65]Fuck!
[255:13.83]Alright.
[255:26.35]That's got more kick than the other ones.
[255:29.19]Thanks, Sam and Max.
[255:30.89]You guys... You guys are my best friends.
[255:35.29]Now can we get back to the deliberation?
[255:37.85]What's the point?
[255:39.76]You still think Peeper's idea is stupid.
[255:43.76]Stupid?
[255:44.72]You never told me you thought my idea was stupid.
[255:47.80]He said your idea of adding Herbert Hoover hugging the four other presidents was the stupidest thing he'd ever heard.
[255:58.48]Well, it is.
[255:59.20]Hoover wasn't even a president, which means he certainly wasn't the most loving of all the presidents.
[256:05.69]Well, at least I didn't suggest putting a parking garage in George Washington's forehead.
[256:11.01]Like some four-eyed freaks I know.
[256:13.07]Right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[256:13.99]You little... You big... Of course you realize this means war!
[256:20.85]War!
[256:22.23]War!
[256:23.26]Didn't he... Doesn't that guy... Doesn't that one piss?
[256:31.24]That one pisses.
[256:35.34]He didn't have to pee.
[256:36.02]That's different.
[256:40.56]What wondrous thing is this the death call?
[256:47.58]Jackson's ring.
[256:52.48]A flashing light.
[256:56.72]Above the door there's just one thing it could be.
[257:16.01]I don't like the way you guys... You guys make me uncomfortable for some reason.
[257:28.78]I don't know why.
[257:57.34]They don't have toddler bodies!
[258:25.57]That's what it is.
[258:51.17]Well, let's not do that again.
[259:23.96]Okay.
[259:26.24]That was a musical number in the middle here.
[259:29.54]I'm gonna throw up.
[259:30.94]No, I'll be fine.
[259:33.88]Why did that hurt me?
[259:34.52]Alright, war run, let's go.
[259:36.94]Let's go conclude this.
[259:37.92]Let's go drop some... I don't know, some fucking chain guns on them or whatever they do.
[259:48.17]Oh, is it not button?
[259:49.15]Is it not button over here?
[259:55.09]There it is.
[259:58.62]Looks like a remote homing beacon in the frigid Antarctic.
[260:01.70]So peaceful.
[260:02.32]Next target.
[260:02.82]So serene.
[260:04.14]Want to blow it up?
[260:05.30]You have to ask?
[260:08.04]Dinner special tonight?
[260:09.50]Penguin flambe.
[260:12.02]Did I just seriously just send a fucking missile?
[260:14.24]Who would have suspected the Washington Monument is really a self-replenishing supply of intercontinental ballistic missiles?
[260:20.26]It's good to see it used for something more useful than pointing in your window for once.
[260:23.20]Are we not going to see...
[260:26.16]I wonder if this will have a significant impact on our delicate ecosystem.
[260:29.64]Absolutely.
[260:30.54]My ego is bigger already.
[260:35.39]Apparently, once we've shot them, there's no... The homing beacon to the Kremlin doesn't seem to be working.
[260:41.73]It was probably turned off in the spirit of Glasnost.
[260:44.47]More likely those lazy commie bastards forgot to change the batteries.
[260:47.89]I don't want to drop, like, fucking bombs everywhere.
[260:53.29]It's the distant, peaceful world of Krypton.
[260:55.94]They mock us with their euclid society of crystal cities and absentee parents.
[261:00.82]They must be exterminated!
[261:02.32]Let's do it.
[261:05.22]This'll teach them to put me in the Phantom Zone.
[261:08.54]Whoa!
[261:09.81]Whoa!
[261:10.37]Whoopsie!
[261:11.43]Whoopsie!
[261:12.01]Whoopsie!
[261:12.43]Whoopsie!
[261:13.61]Hold on.
[261:15.01]Oh boy.
[261:15.51]Oh boy.
[261:17.11]Oh dear.
[261:19.05]We're good.
[261:20.81]You will bow down before me!
[261:26.99]estimated time of impact 26 million years well what do you know bosco was right the government really has been targeting history they really were going to shoot a miss at the boss what do you say we keep this to ourselves max you're right we don't want to ruin the surprise attention bosco shoppers clean up in aisle everything
[261:55.40]He doesn't even know.
[261:56.30]Oh, he has the $100 million laser.
[262:04.71]Bosco's satellite defense system actually works.
[262:07.73]Well played, Bosco.
[262:08.73]Oh my god, that's so dumb.
[262:09.51]You're safe.
[262:17.78]There's no beacon for the missile to lock onto.
[262:19.50]So I can't... Then we'll just have to do this the slow way.
[262:22.76]Lock and load, Sam!
[262:24.14]We're off to Red Square!
[262:26.18]Some other time, little buddy.
[262:28.42]Okay, so I've... I've shot a missile everywhere.
[262:32.10]I gotta get out of here.
[262:34.84]Whee!
[262:37.26]What to do in time of war?
[262:39.00]Select target, press fire.
[262:40.80]Pretty easy.
[262:41.22]That's all it says.
[262:44.96]Oh shit, Kim.
[262:48.77]No, I didn't.
[262:49.35]I didn't.
[262:49.89]No, Kim, I didn't want hot dogs.
[262:51.45]Not until they started talking about it.
[262:54.55]It was the chat.
[262:55.83]They started talking about this image on the screen that you see right now.
[263:00.06]They were talking about that image.
[263:01.70]And then we talked about hot dogs for a little while.
[263:03.66]And I said, oh, man, hot dogs.
[263:05.92]Cool.
[263:07.40]I was like, that didn't happen.
[263:09.74]That was, it wasn't from earlier.
[263:13.09]Salmon's going to be fucking delicious.
[263:14.47]I can't wait.
[263:15.47]Thank you for that.
[263:20.46]Alright, so, uh, we need to take out Abraham Lincoln.
[263:28.34]No, um... Frame that and put it on the fridge!
[263:29.98]So where's... where's Abraham Lincoln?
[263:50.82]The Civil War in the Dakotas seems to be escalating, Max.
[263:53.90]Let them thin out the overpopulation of moose and strip malls for a few weeks, and then we'll step in.
[264:05.48]Truth serum's only useful on people not telling the truth.
[264:11.27]Pasta with garlic bread or salmon?
[264:12.72]That's a tough one because it depends on the day.
[264:15.04]It's a plate of fancy cookies.
[264:16.84]For the discriminating general with a sweet tooth and a taste for vengeance.
[264:21.18]Alright, I gotta settle the buck down.
[264:29.71]Alright, so Bosco's.
[264:31.79]I can't shoot, what was it, Russia?
[264:33.71]And I can't shoot Bosco's.
[264:37.58]Let's go find out why.
[264:43.80]Wait, what did she say?
[264:50.82]Oh wait, that was Kim that asked that question?
[264:54.90]I thought it was just somebody saying, hey man, what do you like more?
[265:01.98]You know what?
[265:02.40]I'm going to make it easy because...
[265:06.48]I was like, oh man, yeah, what do you want to fight?
[265:09.32]A duck-sized horse or a hundred horse-sized ducks?
[265:13.04]Whatever the fuck, I don't know.
[265:17.52]Whatever the... Pasta, because it's easier and I can eat it on stream.
[265:24.80]The pasta sauce takes an hour.
[265:29.62]You're getting the pasta sauce from Italy?
[265:35.87]Now, I'll tell you right now, Kim's pasta sauce is fucking amazing.
[265:41.85]It's worth waiting for.
[265:42.66]It's worth waiting for.
[265:45.40]It's insane.
[265:48.80]Yeah, pasta would be easier to eat on stream.
[265:51.90]I could just turn the camera off for five minutes.
[265:57.60]A good sauce takes four hours.
[266:00.41]A good...
[266:03.48]I've had plenty of sauces out of the jar that were good.
[266:07.38]I've had jar sauces that I would put at like a 7 or 8 out of 10.
[266:11.89]So, I mean, maybe my barometer is not that good for my palate, but... I've had some fucking bag sauce before, too.
[266:24.24]Alright, so I need to go to Bosco's.
[266:32.64]Jerma is drunk.
[266:33.40]Jerma is drunk.
[266:34.10]Jerma is drunk.
[266:34.84]Jerma is drunk.
[266:36.68]Hey, maybe if you say it more, then maybe the more time you say it, maybe it'll be true.
[266:43.06]That sounds good.
[266:43.54]Thank you, Kim.
[266:44.12]You're a wonderful girlfriend, Kim.
[266:47.12]Alright.
[266:51.05]Oh.
[266:51.11]Where are we going, Sam?
[266:52.97]We need to go talk to Boston.
[266:54.03]Back to the office.
[266:55.01]Shotgun!
[266:59.79]Not until the lab upstream.
[267:01.03]No, that's true.
[267:05.50]Alright, let's gooo Bosco!
[267:20.25]I don't know what to do with this.
[267:31.90]What do I do with this?
[267:33.45]I can't... I have to... I'm not gonna throw it away.
[267:35.75]I can't.
[267:36.93]I have to at least clean something with it.
[267:39.39]I could clean my shower with this later.
[267:40.87]Yeah.
[267:51.73]What would it take me to chug this?
[267:55.90]I wouldn't do it for a million dollars.
[267:58.50]I would not chug this Mountain Dew Throwback for a million dollars.
[268:07.94]If you came here with a briefcase full of cryptocurrency BTC, and you said that's a million credits worth of BTC, I'd be like, Dad, close it up.
[268:15.38]I don't want it.
[268:18.66]You're full of shit.
[268:19.84]Try me.
[268:20.24]You got a million dollars lying around?
[268:22.71]Alright.
[268:27.77]Tell us about that missile defense system again.
[268:30.09]Of course I would drink this for me.
[268:31.71]I would drink this for like 30 bucks.
[268:33.49]No, I wouldn't.
[268:35.11]No, I'm not drinking the Mountain Dew.
[268:37.57]I'm going to dump it right now.
[268:39.55]Do I have anything to dump?
[268:40.11]I'm going to dump it in a bucket.
[268:41.42]So nobody can do that.
[268:44.76]I'm going to dump it.
[268:47.74]Quick.
[268:47.98]I'm going to do it quick so nobody can do it.
[268:52.64]No, no.
[268:53.08]It's not in my bucket.
[268:54.85]Somewhere else.
[269:02.27]It's a smaller, but... No, but then it just transfers from one can to another can.
[269:07.43]I don't, I don't have nowhere to put it.
[269:17.10]No.
[269:26.06]Use it as shampoo?
[269:27.12]My hair will fall out.
[269:28.23]I will lose all of my fucking hair.
[269:31.11]Tell us about this missile defense system again.
[269:33.05]I just copied them completely.
[269:35.21]I didn't really mean to do that.
[269:36.35]Once I get funding for it, it'll be able to shoot down any ICBMs targeted at the store.
[269:43.37]Okay, so how do I get to space?
[269:46.53]How do I get up there?
[269:48.59]How do I stop this?
[269:50.77]I need to... How do I change the target?
[269:59.03]$1 lottery tickets, $2.
[270:01.46]I'm feeling lucky already.
[270:15.40]He forgot what he was supposed to be doing.
[270:16.66]I mean, I kind of did.
[270:17.64]I have to go to where he's... There's like a missile thing.
[270:22.89]Where's the missile thing?
[270:32.30]What am I doing this for?
[270:33.12]Oh, this is new.
[270:36.22]Bacon.
[270:36.34]Where's the bacon?
[270:47.00]Maybe if you didn't spend 30 minutes on bad bits, you would know.
[270:51.85]That was a good bit.
[271:00.56]I want everybody in the chat to press 1 if you thought that was a good bit.
[271:02.92]See, shitload of them.
[271:05.70]A shitload of them.
[271:06.64]Okay, so here's the beacon.
[271:07.80]Got it.
[271:07.96]Now we put the beacon onto Abraham Lincoln.
[271:33.63]Go shoot the missile, it's in my pocket.
[271:47.62]We are going to chase down Lincoln.
[271:50.96]Oh, is that a missile in your pocket?
[271:59.73]Ooh, money!
[272:01.89]Money!
[272:02.89]Wait.
[272:05.10]Hold on.
[272:05.88]Beacon.
[272:12.54]One-hit marker.
[272:15.59]Okay, I'll get the Brez.
[272:16.33]Ah, nice!
[272:17.03]Okay, bye.
[272:34.27]Launch missile at Abraham Lincoln.
[272:41.20]Bits, right.
[272:42.04]Okay, who gave those bits?
[272:43.28]Over here.
[272:44.22]I'm checking over here every now and again.
[272:46.88]Uh, Spoons for self-defense, $50, 5,000 bits for Spoons.
[272:51.44]From Spoons for self-defense.
[272:53.28]Thank you, Spoons.
[272:55.08]And they say, hey, Jerma police, chug the Mountain Dew and say your new catchphrase.
[272:59.20]Hoo-yah!
[273:00.58]Time for me to s- what?
[273:05.91]I'm not doing that.
[273:17.05]No!
[273:17.51]I'm not doing the catchphrase and I'm not drinking a Mountain Dew throwback!
[273:22.15]I can't do that!
[273:24.59]I... okay.
[273:26.29]Listen to me, guys.
[273:29.51]Listen to me, bros and broettes.
[273:31.59]Listen, if I chug this right now, you have to understand something.
[273:35.96]The stream turns off in like 40 minutes because I'm going to shit my pants.
[273:41.42]So what's more important?
[273:44.42]Me chugging this and shitting my pants in 45 minutes and the stream turning off or another like three and a half hours, four hours in the stream?
[273:55.99]If I drink this shit, it's going to be bad.
[274:03.66]No, this stuff sucks.
[274:05.18]I'm not doing it.
[274:19.23]Let me be the one guy.
[274:20.43]Don't do it.
[274:25.10]I knew that if one guy was always going to come in handy at some point.
[274:29.66]I was certain.
[274:35.26]Thank God for that one guy.
[274:44.50]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[274:46.40]No more money.
[274:47.23]No more.
[274:47.49]Don't give any more money.
[274:49.05]That's $50 from Colonel Zero.
[274:50.69]Chug it.
[274:50.99]I fucking triple dog dare you.
[274:52.19]I'm not doing it.
[274:53.47]Don't give any more money.
[274:56.33]I can already feel it.
[274:56.97]It's like a hurting.
[274:57.57]I took like three sips.
[275:01.38]Spoiler alert.
[275:03.74]Spoiler alert for like a gross thing.
[275:05.62]I'm not making this up.
[275:08.38]Mute your ears if you don't want to hear something fucking weird.
[275:11.58]I drank like three or four little chugs of this.
[275:15.43]And my balls hurt.
[275:17.39]Right now.
[275:18.61]It has to be related.
[275:20.81]I don't want to do that.
[275:22.31]I'm not doing any more of this.
[275:24.89]I swear to God that happened.
[275:32.08]I'm not drinking any more of that.
[275:38.19]My back hurts from five hour energy, you see?
[275:40.51]No, stay away from this shit.
[275:42.33]Don't ever drink this.
[275:43.04]Drink water and drink fucking, eat an apple.
[275:47.38]Can you eat a Snickers bar instead, please?
[275:49.40]No, I'm not gonna, I value non-testicular pain versus, mm-mm.
[276:04.39]Can we blow up Abraham Lincoln, please?
[276:08.43]I don't care what the straw poll says.
[276:10.01]Half a Snickers.
[276:21.90]You act weird when you're hungry.
[276:28.17]I actually got some really good chocolates.
[276:30.63]No, plus I'm gonna be eating like pasta in like 45 minutes.
[276:34.03]I'm not drinking that.
[276:36.59]Nobody wants to drink that.
[276:42.65]If the... Just link it to me.
[276:44.03]Where's the straw poll?
[276:47.43]If that straw poll has more... Okay, I'm not going to click this yet.
[276:50.49]If this poll has even 5% that say don't do it, I'm not doing it.
[277:15.91]Oh, it's 30%.
[277:16.69]No, no way.
[277:21.89]It's at 31%.
[277:22.71]No, I'm not drinking it.
[277:28.73]I can't get the poll to load because there's fucking 6 trillion people clicking on it.
[277:33.21]Do it!
[277:38.05]That's not how democracy works.
[277:39.25]This isn't a democracy right now.
[277:43.35]I didn't put up a vote.
[277:46.37]Hey, Mr. President, uh, can you, like, chug this Mountain Dew and shit your pants?
[277:51.38]Got it.
[278:09.74]That was better than feeding laxatives to pigeons on parade days.
[278:13.24]We broke two presidents in one afternoon.
[278:15.44]A personal best.
[278:17.08]Well, it looks like the country is saved.
[278:19.32]At least for mass hypnosis.
[278:20.40]There's going to be hypnosis in the next one, too.
[278:22.26]Let's abuse my powers as leader of the free world to squeeze the middle class until they're burning their own shoes for heat.
[278:27.72]Sounds fun.
[278:28.52]But I was thinking we could treat ourselves to some chocolate frosted gut bombs and then have a little target practice down at the Smithsonian.
[278:34.94]Sam, you're my best friend.
[278:37.30]Agent Chuckles, report.
[278:53.87]You just made me miss an important storyline!
[279:04.83]I chugged it.
[279:05.51]Oh, I chugged it.
[279:09.73]That was fucking heavy.
[279:13.71]Fuck.
[279:15.31]I told you.
[279:19.19]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[279:20.45]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[279:29.89]No, I don't want to do that, just leave it in there.
[279:42.83]I did not, I did not say, thanks for the money, idiot.
[279:47.30]That didn't happen.
[279:54.28]This fucking music is gonna kill me.
[280:02.21]I'm gonna take my money to the just chatting section.
[280:04.79]And I hope you spend it wisely.
[280:06.61]Ugh.
[280:29.74]34-year-old man is being peer pressured into chugging a Mountain Dew on stream with like a shitload of money.
[280:42.78]This is not... When Abraham Lincoln fucking created the universe, this is not what he thought was going to happen.
[280:51.21]Benjamin Franklin is just like, there's no way he would have ever expected that something like this was going to happen.
[281:02.22]How could you ever think that?
[281:08.53]Alright, anyways.
[281:09.27]We're gonna move on to episode five.
[281:12.11]I can already feel it rumbling.
[281:15.07]Alright.
[281:19.33]One thousand in favor.
[281:20.33]I chugged it!
[281:21.59]I- okay.
[281:23.13]No one ever told me to chug the whole can.
[281:25.62]They said chug it, and I did.
[281:27.02]I gave you a cartoon chug.
[281:28.42]I did at least five seconds of cartoon chug.
[281:32.27]No one ever said the whole can.
[281:34.35]Monkey's paw, guys, right?
[281:36.71]Right?
[281:37.51]You don't be careful what you wish for.
[281:39.07]You got to make it clear.
[281:52.72]Chug means chug.
[281:53.58]No, chug means... That's all it means.
[281:58.28]It doesn't mean chug whole cans.
[282:02.96]Alright, I'm gonna fucking go dump this.
[282:07.10]I'm gonna go dump this abomination of a soda.
[282:18.33]How could it?
[282:18.89]Okay.
[282:19.15]I just, I... Motherfucker!
[282:36.11]I went to the dentist today!
[282:39.07]I went to the dentist!
[282:51.98]I'm not supposed to be doing any of that.
[282:57.91]My dentist would be so pissed.
[282:59.69]Hey, we did some work and we were treating some stuff.
[283:01.91]Make sure you don't stay away from food and beverages for 12 hours or something.
[283:07.29]No, not food and beverages.
[283:07.99]You know what I mean?
[283:08.45]And I'm sitting there drinking Mountain Dew Sugar Throwback Soda.
[283:12.91]And he's going to take that as a slight.
[283:19.82]Call your dentist.
[283:20.50]He's crying.
[283:21.04]He would be.
[283:23.61]Alright, let's fucking move on.
[283:26.41]This stream is going to be like a 12 hour stream if I don't hurry the fuck up and get this over with.
[283:30.53]Alright, that was episode 4.
[283:34.87]That's pretty good.
[283:41.63]Let's quit this.
[283:43.47]And I am actually going to get a real drink.
[283:46.51]I'm going to get a water.
[283:49.41]It's already happening.
[283:52.82]And I'm going to get the episode five ready to go.
[283:56.36]Two episodes left in season one.
[283:58.68]I'll be right back.
[284:20.63]Somebody said, I've had Mountain Dew throwback before, and it's not even as bad as a Baja Blast.
[284:27.03]I can't... I'm making such a big deal out of this, but I'm serious.
[284:31.38]Like, if I drink... If I chug a soda like this, it's gonna be bad.
[284:40.28]It's pretty good, to be honest.
[284:42.41]I don't...
[288:12.61]Okay, sorry, my Steam Big Picture mode opened for no reason.
[288:18.40]This is loud as hell.
[288:22.63]Don't ask me why Big Picture opened.
[288:28.57]I'll fix this in a minute.
[288:30.22]Just let the intro play up.
[288:42.93]We didn't miss the intros right here.
[288:47.32]Unrest in the Dakotas.
[288:48.62]Dispatch equal numbers of giant battle robots to all sides.
[288:52.16]Whoever survives, claim we backed them all along.
[288:54.50]There's two more.
[288:55.28]One more after this.
[288:55.88]One more after this one.
[288:56.60]Let the new guys pilot the giant battle robots.
[288:58.94]Criticism that your domestic policy is too giant battle robot based.
[289:02.60]They can take it up with my new press secretary, the Mame Tron 9000.
[289:07.45]If that's the guys from Air Force One, tell them they get the keys back once they say the magic word.
[289:12.55]Quiet, Max.
[289:13.27]It's the commissioner.
[289:14.80]A total collapse of the economy and downfall of Western civilization?
[289:18.35]Great grinning head of John the Baptist in a pork pie hat stuffed in a rhinestone bowling bag.
[289:22.73]We're on our way.
[289:25.09]We've got a computer crisis to take care of, little buddy.
[289:28.09]Have they tried turning it off and back on again?
[289:30.59]Bigger than that, Max.
[289:31.81]Computers everywhere are going haywire.
[289:33.85]Planes are falling from the sky.
[289:35.67]Nuclear reactors are nearing meltdown.
[289:37.69]And scores of pasty white nerds will be forced to go out... I just proved it was water.
[289:41.17]...with normal people.
[289:41.97]It's a horror.
[289:43.89]Where do we start, Sam?
[289:45.29]The National Consortium of Smart People who are good with computers has been tracking electron surges all over the country.
[289:50.91]And one of the biggest is right here in our neighborhood.
[289:53.90]What an unbelievably convenient coincidence.
[289:56.78]How do we find an electron surge?
[289:58.76]No idea.
[289:59.52]Let's go.
[290:05.12]Wait!
[290:08.98]Expose.
[290:09.50]Fraud.
[290:09.88]Fraud.
[290:10.28]Fraud.
[290:10.68]Fraud.
[290:11.12]Fraud.
[290:12.28]So much fraud.
[290:14.09]It's not fraud.
[290:15.31]It's called acting.
[290:23.41]Hey, would you call Matt Damon a liar?
[290:27.39]No, you wouldn't.
[290:27.95]You'd call him a performer, an actor.
[290:37.53]Alright, turn this shit down, turn that down, turn that down, turn it off, turn that down, put this back up two notches, just right there, slow down.
[290:44.13]Let me listen.
[290:47.49]Sounds pretty close.
[290:55.41]Acting is just lying.
[290:56.67]Oh, really?
[290:57.33]Well, tell that to some of the actors, including myself, that get so immersed in a role that you become that person.
[291:06.00]Streamer, right?
[291:07.16]Streamer.
[291:08.32]I think I do pretty good at that.
[291:09.68]I immerse myself as streamer.
[291:13.92]Acting is not lying.
[291:14.84]Acting is a craft.
[291:16.65]It's about becoming someone else.
[291:20.83]Don't rain on my craft or you will be removed from this chatroom.
[291:31.40]Tax fraud!
[291:32.78]Acting!
[291:35.46]He's a failed actor.
[291:36.66]I'm not a failed actor.
[291:37.64]I'm an accomplished actor.
[291:40.10]That was on the cover of a fucking magazine.
[291:48.73]What magazine you ask?
[291:57.23]Next question.
[292:02.51]I have too many cans in this room.
[292:15.51]Maybe you could try acting like a man that can handle an entire soda.
[292:31.06]Even if he was just a puppet, Max, don't you think it's unsettling to keep the head of the former president inside our closet?
[292:36.79]You're right, Sam.
[292:37.67]We need to get a pipe.
[292:38.63]He can't handle a soda.
[292:39.91]I could drink.
[292:42.68]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[292:45.08]We've got an emergency.
[292:46.06]Ah, I gotta change to episode five, you're right, thank you.
[292:58.54]This is episode five, reality 2.0.
[293:03.34]So what's the best episode of season one?
[293:06.32]What do people think is the most fun and most interesting episode?
[293:18.58]This one is supposed to be the best one.
[293:22.52]So the... the one... this... okay, that's cool.
[293:24.64]So this is, like, the best one of the season.
[293:27.62]Or the last one.
[293:29.27]Alright.
[293:30.97]Let's go.
[293:31.67]Let's go.
[293:32.03]Let's start with Bosco.
[293:34.59]Dermot lied about dev... uh... dev... do throwback.
[293:42.96]Is there corn in there?
[293:43.72]Cheese?
[293:52.99]Is he not?
[293:53.37]What's the... Hey, Bosco.
[293:55.23]Greetings and well met, friend watchman for hire.
[293:59.84]Sam, how come I suddenly have a primal desire to beat Bosco savagely?
[294:04.28]Because he's talking like a renaissance fair attendee, Max.
[294:07.32]It's an innate fight or flight response.
[294:09.91]I am El Bosco Drill, the unhinged, mighty half-elf ranger.
[294:18.18]Why'd you become an elf?
[294:18.98]Sorry.
[294:19.12]That's true.
[294:19.58]Point being... It's not safe there.
[294:47.45]In fact, that's the most unsafe place you could be.
[294:50.39]You don't want to be on the Internet.
[294:51.99]Trust me!
[295:07.49]You want to make your career on the Internet?
[295:11.73]Is that what you want?
[295:12.39]Just be ready for that, Bosco.
[295:22.21]What does this Internet do, Hickey, have to do with being an elf?
[295:25.53]Half-elf!
[295:27.37]It's because everyone on the Internet has to pick an avatar, like a dwarf or an orc or a hot, young 15-year-old girl curious about the adult world and willing to experiment.
[295:37.42]I didn't think it was possible, but he's actually less creepy as the elf.
[295:41.48]Half-elf, fool!
[295:43.60]Ah, never mind.
[295:44.54]You guys don't understand how computers work.
[295:51.28]Okay Bosco I'm gonna have to ask you to settle down and But now You're taking your store online where will that leave us next game no fear and mistrust computers Don't worry guys.
[296:12.64]My online store will offer twice the inconvenience at thrice the price Well, see you there
[296:21.43]Alright, we want to buy something.
[296:22.67]What do you have for sale this time?
[296:24.31]You guys have said that to me before, and it's happened.
[296:34.56]I'm fairly certain I've gotten like $30, and somebody told me to stop doing the voice I was doing.
[296:40.72]I know what it's like.
[296:41.54]Bosco, I'm telling you, don't be telling to get away from the internet.
[296:47.34]What have you got?
[296:48.30]Oh, not much.
[296:49.30]Just a virulent biological weapon.
[296:51.88]Alright.
[296:53.02]Biological weapons?
[296:54.74]We don't like to judge.
[296:56.51]Speak for yourself, Sam.
[296:58.01]But isn't Jerm warfare a little on the south side of ethical?
[297:01.65]I've got to compete to stay in the market, guys.
[297:04.23]If an arms dealer is going to open up shop in my store, I've got to up the ante.
[297:11.90]How much for the... It's going to be a billion dollars.
[297:13.36]How much for this virulent biological weapon of yours?
[297:16.16]One.
[297:17.06]billion dollars we'll take it what's another billion or so to the national deficit it's gonna be like a far sorry for safety reasons I no longer accept cash in the store you'll have to pay online that's pretty inconvenient thank you okay do you have any dual core processors with 512 megabytes I like the btc
[297:43.39]Do you have any... chimpanzee-sized diapers?
[297:46.17]Nay!
[297:47.37]Nay.
[297:48.45]Do you have any... barbecue plankton chips?
[297:51.29]Nay!
[297:52.03]Doesn't sound that bad, actually.
[297:53.57]Do you have any... keychains with a plus-eight modifier to dexterity?
[297:57.56]I wish.
[297:59.54]Do you have any... self-respect?
[298:02.44]Nay!
[298:03.32]Haha, tricked you!
[298:05.00]No, I understood the question.
[298:06.96]I understood it all too well.
[298:08.99]Whoa.
[298:09.57]You sure do know how to suck the fun out of everything, Bosco.
[298:14.40]Do you have any... Lombos?
[298:19.70]Isn't that... No, that's... I was gonna say, isn't that the thing with the streamer joke thing?
[298:24.09]The streamer have, uh, Nembo, whatever it's called.
[298:31.51]On second thought, nothing for us now.
[298:32.99]512.

[298:34.25]LOL.
[298:35.25]Do you have any... See you later, Bosco.
[298:37.07]I like that tongue roll.
[298:38.57]Defenders!
[298:58.87]I can do it.
[299:00.77]I can hold it for about 25 seconds, too.
[299:04.13]Now you can't jump.
[299:04.73]Alright, settle down.
[299:05.83]I'll act.
[299:11.51]Camera in the fridge.
[299:13.37]Fluids so well preserved, they're nearly fit to drink.
[299:20.56]Is it wrong to like music?
[299:22.68]Only if you can hear it.
[299:26.42]Let's get cracking.
[299:27.12]Let's go.
[299:28.12]I've already drank water, don't worry.
[299:29.50]The hydration bot is broken because the hydration bot doesn't understand that I drank that fake Mountain Dew.
[299:35.19]It doesn't even... Hydration bot doesn't even consider Mountain Dew water.
[299:39.37]It's not even... It's not with water in there, apparently.
[299:41.23]Wait, I gotta talk to the mouse with the cannon.
[299:56.41]Hydration pot says, chug.
[299:59.84]Yeah, water.
[300:00.80]Hey, hands off the merchandise, pigs.
[300:08.20]Didn't people used to do that?
[300:09.16]I remember the guy that used to have the cannon shoot him in the stomach, and his stomach would jiggle around.
[300:15.96]Was that shit real?
[300:17.12]That didn't really happen, right?
[300:21.99]Well, if it isn't our favorite ethically challenged rat, Jimmy Two Teeth.
[300:26.95]Sam was wondering where you'd scampered off to.
[300:28.99]That's real?
[300:31.25]I was wondering what embarrassing pose we'd use when we had you stuck in the mountains.
[300:34.37]That's not from The Simpsons.
[300:35.37]Yeah, yeah.
[300:36.07]I'm scared out of my wits.
[300:38.19]Yous gonna buy something or what?
[300:49.24]Where have I seen this?
[300:56.63]yeah here it is you guys I'm not I wasn't I wasn't lying this guy lives to 81.
[301:27.67]Is this the toughest man ever?
[301:32.13]Meet Frank Cannonball Richards.
[301:37.83]That's fucking real.
[301:42.57]He lived to 81.
[301:43.17]Holy shit, that guy's made out of plutonium.
[301:56.28]Don't try that at home.
[301:59.98]What's a two-bit crook like you trying to sell this to me?
[302:02.14]And I can't even drink a soda.
[302:03.34]I'll ignore that petty insult for the sake of a successful transaction.
[302:07.78]I'll always get the goggles on.
[302:09.80]An interpersonal defense.
[302:12.18]You're an arms dealer?
[302:13.58]You make it sound so cheap.
[302:15.80]I deal in... Fuck, stop doing that.
[302:18.36]Alright, so he's got a cannon.
[302:22.75]What have you got in stock?
[302:24.18]I just keep seeing the cannonball hit him in the stomach.
[302:47.46]How much for the cannon?
[302:48.04]How much for that cannon?
[302:49.18]It's not for sale.
[302:50.96]Worst arms dealer ever.
[302:53.24]That's The Simpsons part, guys.
[302:54.20]It's not for sale to you guys.
[302:56.02]I don't sell to the police.
[302:57.68]Call it my own ethical code.
[303:00.02]But we're just barely police.
[303:02.04]Yeah, I seen how you guys work.
[303:04.96]I sell it to you, and next thing I know, the bunny's got it pointed right at me.
[303:12.01]Alright, so we gotta get the cannon eventually here.
[303:14.07]See you later, Jimmy.
[303:15.35]Maybe if you can find me
[303:18.94]What do you mean?
[303:19.48]You're going to be right here.
[303:20.98]Alright, let's go talk to Sybil.
[303:26.66]Sybil!
[303:32.63]Press, you are under arrest.
[303:33.73]I will.
[303:34.01]I will eliminate him.
[303:34.63]Let's go check some stuff.
[303:36.07]I want to check a few things.
[303:40.99]Let's go check and see what Sybil's up to.
[303:47.75]He's alt-tabbing.
[303:48.68]Well, I just have a lot of tabs open and I'm gonna close them.
[304:00.29]Hey, Sybil.
[304:00.97]Have you... Oh, no.
[304:01.71]Lots of Mountain Dews.
[304:21.58]Actually, now that I look closely, it's more like our last case.
[304:24.90]And the three before that.
[304:26.22]If there's one thing I've learned to recognize recently, it's a hypnotic device.
[304:30.05]Another hypnosis device.
[304:35.77]To break her out of the trance, we'll have to deliver a blow to her head.
[304:39.01]You know, Sam, when you love what you do, it doesn't even feel like work.
[304:46.34]Do I still have the... Yeah, I got it.
[304:48.99]so she's just waiting around VR diablo uh well intercoms right pager nobody knows can I let William tell the goggles I can't shoot sybil
[305:16.70]But I can't ruin her fucking store.
[305:19.56]Alright, um... Gonna have to come back in here with something else to distract her.
[305:25.75]Or stop her from moving.
[305:29.15]Okay, I'm not trying to exit.
[305:36.25]I know that now.
[305:37.01]I'm just checking.
[305:44.88]Let's leave!
[305:48.64]Just take the glasses off.
[305:50.12]Yeah, I know.
[305:50.88]I don't know why you just can't pull them off.
[305:54.06]Not like her eyeballs are gonna, like, come out with it.
[305:57.40]Maybe they will.
[306:04.25]Go to the dentist and put my videos of streams on the TV.
[306:08.91]That would be really, really awkward.
[306:12.83]That would be so strange.
[306:20.00]I don't know.
[306:20.30]I could never go back to that dentist again.
[306:21.64]Because I would just be the streamer guy.
[306:24.64]Alright, anything else in here?
[306:34.22]The streamer dentist.
[306:41.73]Now, what it would have been, what you should have said there is if I went in there and put my stream on the TV and he looked back and he laughed at me and he was like, okay, buddy.
[306:51.53]And he points up to a webcam that's pointing down at us and he's streaming my dental work to like three times as many people.
[307:14.25]Like what, am I trying to like show him up?
[307:15.75]Like, hey man, look at me, I'm on that TV, huh?
[307:22.75]Can I go anywhere?
[307:24.81]Where are we going, Sam?
[307:26.28]Nowhere in this old rust bucket.
[307:28.34]At least not until we get it fixed.
[307:30.48]Oh, right.
[307:31.40]Sorry about that.
[307:32.40]I didn't realize it was an important piece until the explosion.
[307:37.16]OK, so how do I get him out of VR?
[307:49.08]Why is this closed up?
[307:55.32]Get a cavity filled on stream.
[307:56.42]I don't have any cavities.
[307:58.70]I don't get cavities.
[308:00.30]I... don't drink very much soda, and I don't eat very much candy.
[308:04.89]Until today, apparently.
[308:08.41]Go get a cavity!
[308:09.95]Get a cavity!
[308:12.81]Have you guys lost your minds?
[308:20.27]Those tricks, Jimmy.
[308:21.59]You're under arrest.
[308:22.09]Just living the life of a simple businessman making an honest living.
[308:27.97]Freelance police, Mr. Teeth.
[308:29.71]You're under arrest.
[308:30.98]Come along quietly and we'll only use excessive force instead of medieval.
[308:35.22]Just try it, pigs.
[308:36.92]Last time I checked, it was a free country.
[308:39.84]I'm working on that.
[308:44.51]Enough games, Jimmy.
[308:45.85]You're under arrest.
[308:47.63]You're actually under arrest.
[308:49.69]You're under fucking arrest.
[308:51.67]Come with me.
[308:52.61]No citizen shall be prevented from setting up shop without a license and in someone else's store to sell dangerous weapons indiscriminately to the highest bidder.
[309:03.05]Who in his right mind would pass such an irresponsible law?
[309:05.58]That was Max.
[309:06.24]I couldn't help it, Sam.
[309:07.46]Max did it.
[309:08.12]Good Robbie has these unbelievable gift baskets.
[309:13.38]Sell us the cannon, Jimmy.
[309:14.92]I already told you.
[309:16.22]It's not for sale.
[309:18.32]Okay.
[309:19.68]So, very, very, very clearly, uh, we have to punch him in the face.
[309:30.40]He's gotta reload it!
[309:31.68]He's gotta reload it!
[309:32.50]Look at how long it takes to reload!
[309:33.58]Alright.
[309:35.06]So, he shoots the cannon.
[309:47.95]But instead of hitting me... Do I have to stuff the cannon?
[309:53.32]Maybe I can fill the cannon with something?
[310:02.55]Eventually I'm gonna die.
[310:03.65]This is going to kill me.
[310:11.11]Oh, alright, so I... So it is when he's reloading.
[310:14.95]I've got, like, eye crusties right now.
[310:22.07]Why?
[310:22.87]I haven't been asleep.
[310:24.75]You know when you get, like, the eye crust?
[310:27.17]That usually happens when you go to bed.
[310:28.25]Alright, so now I've got the cannon.
[310:35.50]Rat cannon.
[310:37.28]Which now, let me shoot the rat cannon at Sybil.
[310:41.60]The rat will hit Sybil.
[310:43.41]Won't hurt her.
[310:44.03]It's just a rat.
[310:45.85]It'll knock the goggles off and we can have a conversation.
[310:53.41]I think that's a fair assessment of what's going on.
[311:03.41]Finally, your boomer brain is working.
[311:05.53]No, it was working the whole time.
[311:09.49]Look, we've toned down a little.
[311:12.58]We've high energy for the first four or five hours here.
[311:14.84]I'm like, no, let's go.
[311:16.38]You know what I mean?
[311:26.81]See, guys, he did the Dr. Evil.
[311:32.81]That actually would have really hurt.
[311:38.19]Details don't matter.
[311:38.83]We at least saved your life.
[311:59.42]I wasn't hypnotized.
[312:00.60]I was playing a computer game.
[312:02.40]No need to thank us.
[312:03.40]We're freelance police.
[312:04.60]It's what we do.
[312:05.62]Thank you.
[312:06.86]You guys just ruined my new job.
[312:09.04]What, your new job was flailing around like a hyperactive fan dancer while screaming gibberish?
[312:13.36]That job's already taken, lady.
[312:14.76]We're freelance police.
[312:16.06]It's what we do.
[312:16.64]I'm a beta tester.
[312:18.93]I was playing Reality 2.0 with those goggles.
[312:22.53]And look, you broke them.
[312:24.55]And I haven't even paid off the deposit.
[312:26.31]Reality 2.0.
[312:29.14]Is she streaming?
[312:31.43]Alright, so, uh, what's Reality 2.0?
[312:33.19]Let us know.
[312:33.63]Reality 2.0.
[312:35.47]I suspected as much.
[312:36.75]It's a new, full-immersion, interactive, massively multiplayer adventure.
[312:41.53]You play with these VR goggles and a Wi-Fi link to a distributed game server.
[312:46.02]Wi-Fi?
[312:46.34]You might want to explain some of your more elaborate terms to my technology-challenged little pal.
[312:50.98]I'm confused by your word, reality.
[312:53.72]Oh, sorry.
[312:54.98]Sometimes I forget you guys are Luddites.
[312:57.48]We are not.
[312:58.34]We're just very good friends.
[313:00.36]Reality 2.0 is like a video game.
[313:03.16]You put on those goggles and enter a different world.
[313:06.66]It's going to be the biggest thing on the internet.
[313:10.62]VR.
[313:11.30]This is early VR.
[313:13.20]They called it.
[313:13.74]Okay.
[313:15.86]What's wrong with the goggles?
[313:17.46]What's wrong with the goggles?
[313:18.64]Why are they screwed up?
[313:19.20]You broke them.
[313:20.16]That's what.
[313:21.30]It looks like the rear slot downstream signal framostat regurgitator chip is blown out.
[313:26.03]He has no idea what he's talking about, does he?
[313:29.32]never okay uh what's a beta tester I know what that is but I play computer games they don't find bugs that need to be fixed before released don't you have to have valve indexes a thousand dollars all you do is go through somebody else's hard work and point out what they did wrong I was a therapist I'm surprised it's not wireless I'm surprised it's not wireless

[317:25.54]It's not what you know, it's who you know!
[317:28.19]The internet knows everyone.

[318:16.80]Sybil asks us to tender her resignation.
[318:19.02]She's got seasonal affective disorder.
[318:21.14]And scurvy!
[318:22.44]That is too bad.
[318:23.90]There is a lot of that going around these days.
[318:27.93]Okay, where is the internet?
[318:34.93]Where can we find the internet?
[318:39.47]We're gonna have to snip wires?
[318:43.08]All computers on the planet are now working to create Reality 2.0.
[318:47.32]The only access to the internet is through Reality 2.0.
[318:49.98]So we have to go into Reality 2.0.
[318:52.52]Let's do it.
[318:53.89]We'd like to play Reality 2.0.
[318:56.09]Reality 2.0 requires our advanced virtual reality goggles, which may not be available in some markets.

[319:54.81]Alright.
[319:56.45]What do we do with the chip?
[320:02.07]Okay, so go get the goggles, join the internet, and let's, let's, uh... Just use those, yeah.

[320:34.09]2013?
[320:34.11]2012?
[320:34.27]Whenever it came out?
[320:39.12]Oh, back this way.
[320:42.42]Not on stream.
[320:43.16]No, no.
[320:43.40]This is off.
[320:44.30]I wasn't even streaming.
[320:45.62]This was back when I was doing YouTube.
[320:50.72]Alright, so... We need to repair... Computer chip into... Where are the goggles?
[320:56.51]They're over here, right?
[320:57.15]Broken.

[321:00.39]Goggles.
[321:04.74]Wait, yeah, wait.
[321:05.59]Did I?
[321:06.03]I didn't stream it.
[321:06.83]I don't remember streaming it.
[321:07.67]Alright, so are we in?
[321:35.99]R.I.P.
[321:36.25]Jerma's YouTube.
[321:37.15]I had a dream like this once.
[321:39.21]You sold me a defective walrus and then vanished in a puff of orange smoke.
[321:43.93]How is she still here?
[321:44.99]Welcome to Reality 2.0, the perfect place of perfect happiness.
[321:48.96]I'm your host, the Internet.
[321:50.82]I didn't think the Internet had a face.
[321:53.08]Reality 2.0 is a lot like Sybil's office.
[321:56.34]Reality 2.0 is designed to be superior to ordinary reality in every way.
[322:01.58]Sam still looks the same.
[322:03.02]That's because I'm already perfect.
[322:05.17]Reality 2.0 simulates your world and links it to cyberspace while providing a clever fusion of popular gameplay styles guaranteed to amuse the statistically average person.
[322:16.20]It's everything for everyone.
[322:18.28]Then why do you need to hypnotize people with the goggles?
[322:20.97]Come on, what are you, a politician?
[322:22.35]Answer the question.
[322:23.31]It figures.
[322:23.63]Hello, Internet?
[322:24.29]Are you there?
[322:24.77]He's gonna get beef-brained.
[322:51.47]lips what do these lips do testing testing reality 2.0 has this convenient audio blog feature this seems like a great way to keep notes and communicate with other players while I'm beta testing anytime you guys know when you go like this and all your mouth goes like this if you go like like I don't understand why that happens every time
[323:20.76]Okay, so there's an audio blog.
[323:21.80]Oh, it's not.
[323:22.10]It's fake Sybil.
[323:22.46]Okay.
[323:22.64]Ray gun, computer bug.
[323:23.98]Okay, they look different.
[323:24.54]That's cool.
[323:46.64]Cute sign.
[323:47.12]Musty.
[323:47.32]That's kinda gross.
[324:00.03]Okay, digital clock.
[324:01.35]It is 12.
[324:01.71]No, it's broken.
[324:02.47]Itchy eye.
[324:02.67]Actual website, is it?
[324:27.21]Can we leave here?
[324:27.73]There's a conspicuous golden glow coming from the crack underneath this door.
[324:31.59]There must be loot in there!
[324:32.87]Open the door, Sam!
[324:34.27]I can't, you deficient little monkey.
[324:36.04]It's locked.
[324:37.76]Hmm.
[324:43.14]That's got a great sound.
[324:46.00]It's a loot box?
[324:46.82]Yeah, it kind of is, isn't it?
[324:47.76]Uh... What happens if we leave?
[324:53.27]Are we just in the virtual world town?
[325:01.56]Well, this is different.
[325:02.33]I just want to see.
[325:09.93]So we have to go in and out of virtual reality.
[325:16.92]So we go in, out.
[325:21.28]tree a tree grows in reality 2.0 this simulation is totally unrealistic 404 street is overrated reality 2.0 is designed to be superior just like paper this happened in paper this happened in paper Mario
[325:40.56]Hello, dearies.
[325:41.81]If you have anything to mail, hand it over for inspection.
[325:45.43]What are you, a male cop?
[325:46.77]Don't be a dope.
[325:47.63]She's obviously a female cop.
[325:49.45]Actually, I'm a computer program.
[325:52.00]Antibiotic.
[325:53.88]I guard the internet from nasty, crippling germs and diseases and make sure only legitimate mail gets through.
[325:59.81]like religious chain letters and advertisements for performance enhancing medications from Canada you got it cigarettes can't advertise cigarettes what's the what's the plus one let's find out what exactly is the symbolism of that insignia on your armor you mean you're not familiar with the almirani masterworks line if we pretend we know what you're talking about will you tell us what the heck you're talking about this is plus one armor
[326:22.79]Which means... Which means that any weapon, plus one or less, will be useless as a butter knife on... Do we have to kill people with a weapon?
[326:32.61]You boys really need to get with it.
[326:34.31]Okay.
[326:39.26]I don't suppose you know anyone by the name of Myra Stump?
[326:42.96]I even got the laugh too.
[326:44.78]Alright, it's time for me to power down.
[326:47.16]You ready?
[327:20.37]Alright, power down.
[327:21.27]End of the stream?
[327:24.38]No, I'm just powering down.
[327:30.72]I'm gonna be eating pasta in a minute.
[327:31.96]He's gonna put on clown makeup.
[327:32.78]The clown makeup's going on.
[327:33.48]Alright.
[327:34.16]So we need a +2 weapon.
[327:35.36]I don't know what that even means.
[328:00.90]coins look max some form of oversized currency just hanging in the air 10 out of 10 survey subjects agree no known experience can match the raw exhilaration of repeatedly leaping for things floating just out of one's reach oh it's science sam we need those coins now this is the car does the car work in virtual reality hey that looks like our car and then I say we claim it where are we going sam
[328:30.80]Uh, nowhere.
[328:31.62]Alright.
[328:36.22]Control room.
[328:38.54]Read only.
[328:41.14]Read only.
[328:44.50]Virtual office.
[328:46.81]Recycling bin.
[328:48.53]That's not terrifying.
[328:49.41]Alright, virtual office.
[328:58.43]Well, I guess this is what our office would look like if it didn't exist yet.
[329:02.35]What?
[329:03.15]You guys?
[329:04.09]I swear, wherever I go, there you are.
[329:06.65]Don't tell me you've become a Buddhist.
[329:09.54]Say, what have you got there, Jimmy?
[329:11.68]Oh, no.
[329:12.36]Get away from me.
[329:13.40]We're going to have to collect all the coins.
[329:15.48]No way.
[329:16.54]I stole this coin fair and square.
[329:19.30]Now, Jimmy, we can do this the easy way or we can do it the hard way.
[329:22.42]But personally, I'm leaning towards the hard way.
[329:25.94]It's mine.
[329:27.12]Beat it.
[329:30.32]Alright, we'll get in there and we'll get the coin.
[329:32.10]Remember the glow coming from behind Sybil's door?
[329:35.52]Oh, I'm ready.
[329:35.82]He's making the rules now.
[329:36.48]That's right.
[329:54.47]Do I have anything to put in there?
[329:56.65]No, no cheese or anything.
[329:57.75]Do I have to get virtual cheese?
[330:00.43]Virtual phone?
[330:02.53]Maybe.
[330:05.85]That virtual phone doesn't work?
[330:06.83]Why is the phone red?
[330:21.69]The phone is bright red and everything else in here is purple.
[330:25.25]What's Mr. Spatula?
[330:27.59]How is it that Mr. Spatula is here?
[330:29.79]Tiny waterproof goggles?
[330:35.81]Well, I don't think I can do anything else here.
[330:39.29]Ant farm.
[330:40.05]Cyber ants.
[330:41.33]Reality 2.0 is the first and only massively multi-ant experience.
[330:46.69]Girl, you have got to go on a picnic sometime.
[330:49.59]That's all I'm saying.
[330:55.36]Ants.
[330:57.16]Alright, so there's ants.
[331:06.09]Coins, ants.
[331:09.37]What about down here?
[331:10.13]This is like two episodes in one, huh?
[331:15.29]Really white teeth.
[331:16.03]Wait, you're not?
[331:35.76]No, silly.
[331:37.08]I'm the Internet Wizard.
[331:39.06]I'm an entirely virtual being, you see.
[331:41.80]But I've thoughtfully taken the form of Hubliz to help you understand my role in your new reality.
[331:47.64]I still hate you.
[331:49.09]Okay.
[331:51.91]How about a magic trick?
[331:52.89]He's gonna dash away?
[331:53.59]Ooh.
[331:53.67]Gimme, gimme, gimme.
[331:54.33]Rainbow paint.
[332:13.50]How would you get rainbow paint?
[332:16.50]Rainbow paint would just mix together and turn into sludge.
[332:20.26]It's not like Neapolitan ice cream.
[332:22.68]You're gonna ruin your car.
[332:39.40]It's a video game in a video game.
[332:41.22]This is true.
[333:02.49]Okay, we need some cryptic clues.
[333:03.93]Oh, supposedly wise wizard, we have a question for you.
[333:07.07]Hooray!
[333:08.29]Please select your question.
[333:10.02]If you don't see it, simply type it in.
[333:12.56]You can understand what we type?
[333:14.92]No, of course not.
[333:15.62]That's the worst ice cream?
[333:17.06]But typing is fun, and a proven stress reliever.
[333:20.76]That's the joke.
[333:21.74]I was reading what somebody in chat said.
[333:23.60]I was responding to the chatter.
[333:27.96]Okay.
[333:31.51]Can you see our future?
[333:32.95]Why, yes.
[333:34.29]Yes, I can.
[333:36.13]I see... nothing.
[333:39.67]That's terrifying.
[333:40.25]Now, see, I would have phrased that as, no.
[333:43.21]No, I cannot see your future.
[333:45.80]No, I mean I see blackness.
[333:48.62]Blackness all around.
[333:50.84]It's terrible.
[333:53.74]How needlessly enigmatic.
[333:55.12]Thank you.
[333:56.38]Come again.
[333:58.62]Alright.
[333:59.50]Well, we're probably gonna have to do something here.
[334:02.16]We've got a 30-sided die behind us for Dungeons & Dragons.
[334:07.34]We need to go check on that.
[334:08.38]There it is.
[334:09.13]What's a save point?
[334:10.37]That's metal.
[334:11.39]E-beer, E-guns, E-meat, Bosco's E-convenience.
[334:25.16]What's in the gumball machine?
[334:26.14]I guess this is what video game characters eat when they need to rot their teeth out.
[334:29.94]Hey, where are the big honkin' ones that let you eat ghosts?
[334:33.02]Reality 2.0 caters to all manner of life forms, including dead life forms.
[334:37.14]That's Pac-Man.
[334:37.78]My favorite.
[334:38.40]Eating of ghosts has been disallowed to cater to our spectral clientele.
[334:42.27]Apparitions welcome.
[334:43.87]AIs are always so PC.
[334:46.15]Let's go to Virtual Boscos.
[334:52.51]I'm still the president, right?
[334:57.53]Cloak.
[334:58.19]Okay, half elf discount.
[335:01.11]Cloak of Visibility, Elven Boots of Sloth, Wooden Longsword.
[335:06.07]Hot Rump.
[335:07.63]Hold on, I want to look around here.
[335:10.04]Mead.
[335:10.74]It's to die for.
[335:12.14]Spawn Point.
[335:14.26]Sludgy Machine.
[335:15.90]Blue Sludgy.
[335:17.32]Spawn Point?
[335:18.52]What is that?
[335:20.86]Eww!
[335:22.08]It's kind of cute, actually.
[335:23.86]You come out of the sludgy machine?
[335:24.88]Can I pick it up?
[335:25.52]Shoot it?
[335:25.88]Alright, well then I'll shoot it.
[335:27.71]I guess not.
[335:53.44]Am I too close?
[335:58.15]Potions of heavily processed meat tastiness plus one.
[336:02.45]What is that gun?
[336:05.95]Uh, it is a virtual ray gun.
[336:09.27]Carbonated sugar water makes kids jump around.
[336:11.39]Potion of sudden indigestion.
[336:13.17]That's the Mountain Dew that I just was drinking.
[336:18.59]Try donut recycling.
[336:19.94]Alright, let's see.
[336:20.38]What do you got to say?
[336:22.59]This town sucks.
[336:23.65]You know what I mean?
[336:52.19]What a shitty little town.
[336:56.37]There's like seven people that live here.
[337:00.25]Three of them are the little McNugget kids, the convenience store owner, and some lady that runs a new store every single day.
[337:16.15]We are all so bored here.
[337:17.59]No wonder we're doing all this weird shit.
[337:24.38]Bosco, don't look now, but I think your Reality 2.0 goggles may have hypnotized you.
[337:28.50]It's beta.
[337:29.16]Don't be mean.
[337:30.24]Half-elf rangers of my level are impervious to every form of hypnosis enchantment.
[337:36.19]Ooh, this reminds me of those internet quizzes where you look at a bunch of shifty strangers and have to decide, serial killer or United States senator?
[337:43.77]Except we're asking, hypnotized or not hypnotized?
[337:47.46]Yeah.
[337:47.72]Listen, guys, I'm perfectly happy in Reality 2.0.
[337:51.28]I never want to leave, ever.
[337:54.02]Take the goggles off, quick.
[337:55.36]Jerma hates middle America.
[337:57.96]That's not true.
[337:58.46]I'm just saying, there's eight people in the town.
[337:59.92]There's at least 800 in small towns in middle America.
[338:23.86]Okay, how's life on the internet?
[338:25.20]This is just the street.
[338:26.04]Yeah, that's true.
[338:26.50]Yeah, not everywhere has to be a big city.
[338:29.14]It's kind of nice to get, you know, away.
[338:54.71]Some people want to be in a smaller scale, and that's fine.
[338:58.07]Alright, let's wait.
[339:00.98]What can we buy?
[339:01.44]What is the VR goods?
[339:15.28]I don't know what to say.
[339:16.80]And yet, I do have one weapon of such devious simplicity that even an incompetent swordsman such as yourself could wield it.
[339:25.69]The platinum sword of berserker testiness?
[339:27.95]The enchanted crossbow of massive decapitation?
[339:30.59]The pushpin of eternal punishment?
[339:32.30]We need a weapon.
[339:32.94]Nay, the wooden longsword of intenser longness.
[339:40.71]okay so what makes your money so safe on the internet I got it all in one of those offshore banks you know real foreign all digital safer that way oh boy he's gonna lose everything well don't go posting it on the street or nothing but it's called banco lavadero.com banco lavadero isn't that Spanish for baby got back no what I don't know what it means is that true safe

[340:34.10]Oh, easy.
[340:34.34]I'll get him.
[340:55.69]We're never gonna find that kind of money.
[340:57.37]Wait, five gold coins?
[340:58.97]That's it?
[340:59.92]Tis a bargain.
[341:01.08]Tis?
[341:01.68]Three in... That is a bargain.
[341:03.70]Let's go.
[341:04.10]Maybe he'll just tell us.
[341:06.66]Bosco, we want to transfer a huge sum of money to your bank account.
[341:10.04]Just tell us the password.
[341:11.64]Yeah, funny thing.
[341:12.99]The deposed king of Nigeria was just in here saying the exact same thing.
[341:17.55]Yeah, but we're serious and we have guns.
[341:20.35]Give us the password.
[341:22.37]White?
[341:22.57]How do you get into your account?
[341:24.79]Alright, so... He's got his password tattooed on him somewhere.
[341:27.80]Probably on his, like, ass or something.
[341:50.07]Alright.
[341:52.06]Collecting coins.
[341:52.92]We're gonna have to... Okay, collect coins.
[341:54.68]There's three there.
[341:56.30]One in Sybil's room.
[341:58.42]And one in the rat cave.
[342:00.36]Alright.
[342:02.48]So...
[342:19.90]How... How do I get those coins?
[342:29.85]Sorry, I had some... I just had to get that gamer, uh... I had to shake the gamer anxiety out of me.
[342:35.89]Alright, I'm good.
[342:37.17]I had that gamer stress.
[342:39.71]I just had to, like, shoot it out.
[342:44.59]So, uh, there's coins over here.
[342:49.05]Can I throw him up there?
[342:58.61]Come here, Max.
[343:01.49]Will he collect him if I punch him?
[343:06.09]Over here, come here.
[343:07.89]I wonder if he can get him.
[343:12.20]Hey!
[343:14.74]I need you over here.
[343:18.95]I need you over here.

[343:44.86]Can I just shoot it down?

[347:24.79]What is this?
[347:37.56]Well, here we are.
[347:38.74]Banco Lavadero.
[347:40.60]Located conveniently outside the jurisdiction of any significant regulatory body.
[347:44.96]Say, wait a minute.
[347:46.42]This is no ordinary bank.
[347:48.60]Look at all the arrows.
[347:49.42]We've got to launder money around?
[347:50.72]This is a terribly complicated money laundering operation.
[347:53.88]Money launderers.
[347:55.22]I hate those guys.
[347:56.44]They always mix in the 10 euro notes and stain everything pink.
[348:00.05]500 million.
[348:00.43]Mr. Viv.
[348:00.87]Uncook.
[348:23.72]So I need to get this down to Bosco.
[348:26.44]Okay, so... How do I activate them?

[349:10.31]Please speak or enter your password.
[349:15.13]Great Scott.
[349:16.66]Password incorrect.
[349:18.02]Access denied.
[349:18.86]I can't do this right now.
[349:22.32]Well, let's go back to our virtual neighborhood.
[349:31.39]I need to get the password.
[349:34.05]And I did get the coins.
[349:36.61]So.
[349:38.35]What is?
[349:40.21]The correct way I can go back to get I can get out of the virtual world.
[349:42.74]I don't have to be in the virtual world, right?
[349:46.96]What's in the mailbox?
[349:47.66]Oh, there's one place I haven't gone.
[349:49.76]Let me try to go in the control room.
[349:51.64]I thought you liked the Neverhood.
[349:53.14]Why do I suck at this game?
[349:53.88]What are you talking about?
[350:21.34]Jack in the Box!
[350:23.32]Let's kill it!

[350:41.11]I heard that.
[350:43.27]It takes extra power for me to have face cam on.
[350:47.93]The place for all your money laundering needs.
[350:50.79]Banco Lavadero.
[351:03.71]Why are they in the virtual world?
[351:10.67]What the me-hill is going on in here?
[351:13.39]I'm sorry, the selection dialog with cops is currently unavailable in your area.
[351:18.41]Red spy in the base.
[351:21.49]Excuse us.
[351:23.21]We have a reality to simulate.
[351:32.68]Um, well, what's your story, Data Head?
[351:35.84]I'm maintaining your height for your convenience.
[351:38.32]If you're not satisfied with your height, please
[351:42.23]If only it were that easy.
[351:43.31]I'm sorry, the customer service department is currently closed.
[351:47.73]Please try again later.
[351:49.31]But I am satisfied with my height.
[351:51.73]5'7", 5'8", that's fine.
[351:52.57]I don't care.
[351:53.03]I am the master of gravity!
[351:54.84]Doesn't bother me.
[351:55.76]Really?
[351:56.50]I would have guessed master of jollity.
[351:58.34]5'8 is fine.
[351:58.72]You will fall!
[352:04.15]So, how you keeping busy, Mr. Sensitivity?
[352:06.89]User with control.
[352:08.69]User what's it?
[352:10.88]Not at least six feet.
[352:12.72]L-U-L.
[352:15.48]So, what aspect of reality do you control, he who only bleeps?
[352:20.76]Ask a stupid question.
[352:22.38]Well, let's give this thing a push.
[352:24.29]What's the worst that could happen?
[352:25.97]Pressing a button?
[352:26.87]I'm going to start pressing random buttons.
[352:28.51]Let's just try it and see.
[352:41.87]Five eight is almost a foot shorter than me.
[352:43.83]You're six eight?
[352:47.85]You are six eight.
[352:53.46]What?
[352:54.58]You are not six eight.
[353:04.64]Not.
[353:07.02]Shaquille O'Neal is like, what, like 6'10", 7'2", or something?
[353:19.65]Shaquille O'Neal is 7'1".
[353:21.05]6'8".
[353:27.34]No, you're not 6'8".
[353:29.46]I don't believe it.
[353:47.22]Alright, leave me alone!
[353:50.86]Alright, let me figure this out.
[353:52.52]Virtual Sibyls, let's go... What the hell am I supposed to do here?
[354:04.91]You've met people that are 6'8".
[354:06.37]Yeah, fine.
[354:07.09]You pull out 100 people on the subway.
[354:10.57]Wherever you live.
[354:12.87]And you tell me if one of them is 6'8".
[354:25.62]Secret serve ice cream ice cream think that's fooling anyone Okay, so Have I got really okay, let me go back to Bosco's I need something to get the coins I
[354:54.59]Where am I gonna get the damn coins?
[354:56.27]This fan just blows.
[355:03.37]Did you tattoo Bosco?
[355:04.61]I told you I did a little needlework on one of our neighbors.
[355:07.43]Why?
[355:08.21]What have you heard?
[355:09.63]You tattooed something onto an unnamed portion of Bosco's anatomy.
[355:13.70]Oh, that.
[355:14.80]Sure.
[355:15.68]It was really tiny.
[355:17.30]Too much information.
[355:19.16]The tattoo was really tiny, Dimwit.
[355:21.68]Near microscopic.
[355:23.50]Like your brain?
[355:26.22]Um, what was the tattoo?
[355:27.64]On his neck?
[355:28.00]Okay.
[355:50.09]You're willing to believe that there are millionaires watching your stream who are able to consistently give you hundreds of dollars, but it's too much to think that somebody in chat is 6'8".
[355:57.63]But that's, like, I see that.
[356:00.18]It's tangible to me.
[356:02.14]I can't see if somebody's 6'8 or not.
[356:05.30]If somebody gives $100 on stream, I see it going into the stream, into the stream labs.
[356:12.03]If somebody says I'm 6'10", I don't know.
[356:15.25]I have no evidence to back that up.
[356:21.71]Okay.
[356:22.47]You don't remember the tattoo?
[356:23.31]The taller you are, the richer you are.
[356:24.61]I'm gonna come to the next meetup to flex my height on you.
[356:26.07]I'm gonna be wearing shoes that may be three inches taller.
[356:28.32]So, joke's on you.
[356:28.72]Alright, so it's on his neck.
[356:50.92]So how do we see Bosco's ne- we gotta spin him around, right?
[357:01.21]So how do we get Bosco to turn around?
[357:20.17]I swear to God, some of you guys think that apparently like 5'8 is 3 inches tall.
[357:29.95]You know the average height in the United States is 5'9, right?
[357:35.73]What, is that like a fucking foot off the ground?
[357:38.61]Wait, he's not paying attention.
[357:45.05]Uh-oh, boss goes in the grips of those reality 2.0 goggles.
[357:48.56]We better save him, Sam.
[357:49.98]It's so depressing in here without his omnipresent paranoia to lift my spirits.
[357:55.53]Alright, so how do I get him to turn around?
[357:57.03]I need to zoom into his neck.
[358:00.99]Is there any way to see his neck?
[358:13.12]Whee!
[358:15.48]The most historic weenie's this side of the Mississippi.
[358:20.15]They're pestering you.
[358:21.21]I know, and I'm pestering back.
[358:22.95]It's all in good fun.
[358:25.17]I know that I'm huge.
[358:28.37]So how do I get him to fucking turn around?
[358:32.47]I wonder if I can, like, talk to him in the virtual world and make him turn around.
[358:37.38]And then take the goggles off.
[358:38.40]Okay, let's get him to spin around.
[358:48.29]Watch your how.
[358:49.46]We see your password too.
[358:53.14]How do I get him to turn around?
[359:12.70]This may well go down as the most ill-advised question I've ever asked, but may we see your private tattoo?
[359:19.26]No.
[359:20.16]Besides, I didn't tattoo it on my virtual avatar.
[359:23.41]It's on my real body, dummy.
[359:24.83]Yeah, but if you turn around here... I'll just go check out your so-called real body.
[359:28.79]I'm not showing it to you there, either.
[359:34.33]We'll take that long sword, if you please.
[359:36.41]Have you the requisite five coins?
[359:38.99]I might need the five coins first.
[359:40.33]Not quite that many.
[359:47.31]Take off those girls.
[359:48.15]There is no, hey, turn around.
[359:53.06]I don't have an option to say, turn around.
[359:54.94]No.
[360:01.88]Whoa, hey, wait, wait, wait.
[360:10.39]What was he just doing right there?
[360:12.86]What was that?
[360:13.32]I think we need these binoculars more than Bosco does.
[360:19.10]Um, not really.
[360:20.68]Well, no.
[360:21.59]These incessant rationalizations for our questionable tactics do not, in all honesty, have much merit to them.
[360:27.47]And yet there remains a very real proportion to say them.
[360:29.19]I need to get the coins first.
[360:30.75]Because why would he turn around?
[360:32.31]He doesn't really need the binoculars anyway.
[360:33.99]Yeah, right.
[360:34.51]Right, yeah.
[360:35.11]Oh, sure, okay.
[360:40.23]I'm not sure I want him to know I took these.
[360:42.97]Yeah, alright.
[360:43.69]So, there's no... I can't get him to turn around.
[360:52.54]Sekiro Gork?
[360:53.92]What?
[360:55.02]Sekiro Gork dies twice.
[360:59.07]What are you talking about?
[361:05.68]How did you do that?
[361:07.32]Well, I guess it's... we're getting to later, so... I can imagine... yeah.
[361:11.98]Can I look through the window?
[361:13.20]No.
[361:22.29]Alright, well I got the binoculars.
[361:26.47]I need to get the coins.
[361:29.08]Coins... Got the... mmm.
[361:38.72]Uh, let's go back into the virtual world.
[361:40.82]One, two, three.
[361:52.46]I need a +2 sword.
[361:55.36]These guys are over here.
[361:56.38]Hold on.
[362:03.97]Are the other items different in VR?
[362:12.30]Um, hold on.
[362:19.23]I'm more excited for Gork II possibility than any of my levels.
[362:24.63]Ooh, okay.
[362:35.50]So this is... now it's a computer bug.
[362:38.48]Say hello to my little friend.
[362:41.40]Even on his deathbed, he still had to do a joke.
[362:43.54]Come on.
[362:43.94]This is to go smaller.
[362:45.82]Alright, so now we can go to the rat now.
[363:13.29]He can't reach it!
[363:14.51]He can't reach it!
[363:16.75]Let's go to... where are we going?
[363:18.73]The rat.
[363:19.37]What was the rat?
[363:20.65]Sibyls?
[363:21.13]No, he's in the office.
[363:23.97]Into the office.
[363:26.01]Oh, fucking seriously?
[363:28.67]Come on.
[363:29.45]Max, come here.
[363:31.79]Really?
[363:37.00]Well, I can get up there now.
[363:47.58]He can't reach it.
[363:52.54]Now put the goggles on.
[363:54.90]Let's go get that coin from the rat.
[364:01.82]Okay.
[364:03.00]Alright, Jimmy.
[364:04.74]Open up.
[364:06.72]Hey, Jimmy.
[364:07.91]oh hey guys wait a second how'd you uh I thought I told you to beat it well if you insist beating him up okay thanks for the coin Jimmy see you around Jimmy's good people good people very cool okay so that's one so we gotta get out of virtual reality now
[364:35.85]And we have to put the bug on one that makes us grow.
[364:40.15]I'm sure there is one.
[364:42.73]They probably all do something different.
[364:49.98]Sibyl's closet, I think... I don't think I can fit under there.
[364:54.08]I don't think I can fit under there.
[365:08.80]Let's get big and grab these ones.
[365:21.20]Get the bug back.
[365:22.54]And I wonder who it is.
[365:23.58]Four computers.
[365:24.18]Are you OK there?
[365:25.23]OK.
[365:41.07]So you can only do one.
[365:43.49]Thanks for maintaining my height.
[365:44.69]I really appreciate it.
[365:47.07]Just pour gasoline on this chat right now, on the fire.
[365:50.67]Like, just pour gasoline on the fire.
[365:52.25]What does that do?
[366:03.69]And that was pretty cool.
[366:04.46]I kind of want to hear that whole song.
[366:09.84]That was my favorite part of the whole entire season.
[366:14.59]Nah.
[366:17.03]Hi, buddy.
[366:17.85]We brought you a housewarming gift.
[366:19.85]Permission denied.
[366:21.67]Overruled.
[366:23.93]With maintenance routine compromised.
[366:27.45]So this is going to make us wed?
[366:28.83]Look, Sam, we're two-dimensional.
[366:30.55]This feels oddly familiar.
[366:32.96]Holy crap.
[366:34.58]That's hilarious, bro.
[366:36.60]Yikes, that dude's bugging me.
[366:38.24]We can fit through the door now.
[366:39.14]We can slide through the door.
[366:47.41]Oh, man.
[366:47.99]I gotta get some pasta soon here.
[366:50.69]With Kim's secret sauce.
[367:05.30]Hello.
[367:06.84]I'm going to slide through the crack.
[367:09.03]Let's put this new Miracle Diet to the test, shall we?
[367:18.02]I found a gold coin.
[367:19.48]Wow!
[367:20.28]You earned money?
[367:21.82]Where do I sign up?
[367:23.50]I dropped an entire dimension, and I've never felt better.
[367:33.84]Coffee-flavored mayonnaise.
[367:37.70]That is just disgusting enough for me to want to try it.
[367:41.97]I feel like you could put that on a bagel or something.
[367:52.62]Put that on a bagel and sprinkle some cinnamon on it?
[367:58.00]Well, I don't know, that's not that big of a deal.
[368:03.88]And here's the big one.
[368:06.04]I'm gonna puke because of that.
[368:12.53]Hey, these are the late night hours.
[368:13.49]We're in late night hours.
[368:14.81]We can talk about anything we want.
[368:22.86]Sir Isaac Newton must be turning over in his grave.
[368:25.60]Literally.
[368:26.62]I... I... I feel pretty and witty and gay!
[368:32.40]Turn him back!
[368:33.20]Turn him back!
[368:35.94]Did we... What happened?
[368:39.19]Did we not grow?
[368:41.49]What happened?
[368:45.13]The height... What are you doing again?
[368:47.19]I'm maintaining your height for your convenience.
[368:54.25]So what does that do?
[369:00.89]It's gravity.
[369:05.46]Well, I was talking to somebody.
[369:07.42]I'm having like five conversations at the same time.
[369:13.02]Yeah.
[369:18.08]Sellout.
[369:24.01]Alright, that's all of them.
[369:25.47]So then let's bring this back to Bosco.
[369:31.81]And that should get him to turn around and we get the password.
[369:45.39]I know I'm gonna get the sword!
[369:46.33]I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know!

[370:12.33]I know!
[370:19.04]I know.
[370:20.30]Please use caution.
[370:21.68]Injury sustained in reality 2.0 will also affect your physical being in your former reality.
[370:26.63]There's two swords.
[370:32.63]It's stuck.
[370:33.93]I can't even get it.
[370:34.78]I've got better things to punch.
[370:47.36]I guess this is what pixels look like close up.
[371:00.75]Everybody was screaming at me to come up here.
[371:04.25]Get stuck!
[371:05.97]I was being told I was an idiot.
[371:08.59]I was stupid.
[371:09.55]I was dumb.
[371:11.26]Look, Max.
[371:12.00]Liver and onions are... I guess they couldn't get a real gig.
[371:19.82]I want to take the goggles off.
[371:25.20]I can't take off the goggles up here.
[371:26.48]I can't even get it.
[371:35.42]Come on, man.
[371:46.97]Okay, so... I must need to grab it with something else.
[371:54.68]Put the coins in.
[371:55.24]Do I have to put the coins in?
[371:59.08]Oh my god.

[373:12.06]Look at this shit.
[373:15.12]I've seen a video where a guy drops his whole plate of food, so I'm not gonna do that.
[373:25.14]This is good shit.
[373:36.11]This garlic bread looks fucking fantastic.
[373:37.87]Let me see.

[373:42.41]Holy shit!
[373:45.13]Holy shit!
[373:58.56]Can I get someone else to play the game?
[374:05.08]I wish I could just control it with my eyes.
[374:06.56]I can do it.
[374:20.38]Give us the control.
[374:21.04]I wish I could.
[374:25.11]Okay, so let me think about this.
[374:26.33]So if I have the gravity, what about this?
[374:33.39]Hold on.
[374:33.69]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[374:35.49]Hmm.
[374:35.91]Near as I can tell, the only purpose of this thing is to generate those annoying pop-up ads.
[374:39.84]Hold on.
[374:48.74]Go to the cops in the real world.
[374:50.16]Alright.
[374:51.28]Let's check Crunch one more time.

[375:00.45]Isn't she great?
[375:14.01]I don't want to eat on stream, make much of the eating noises.
[375:18.29]Listen to the cool computer voices while I eat.
[375:21.15]I'm gonna try to do this as quickly as I can.
[375:23.15]I'll be right back.
[375:26.61]Listen up, cops.
[375:31.21]The Internet is using you machines to hoodwink and enslave the world's populace.
[375:35.27]And as President of the United States, that's my job.
[375:38.52]We only wish to help.
[375:43.52]See you guys later.
[375:44.42]End of line.
[376:03.06]Somebody said this is... Somebody said this is scary.
[376:09.71]It doesn't feel right.
[376:11.29]It feels too awkward.
[376:13.13]You're watching just a gameplay walkthrough on YouTube.
[376:19.40]This is scary.
[376:28.90]Is this some kind of fancy water-cooling thingamabob to support your super-fast processor?
[376:33.84]It is for output, not input.
[376:37.18]And I do not like to talk about it.
[376:40.05]Yikes!
[376:40.55]That makes two of us!
[376:44.21]So everyone wanted me to talk to one of these so badly.
[376:47.43]Which one was it?
[376:48.97]Listen up, cops.
[376:52.29]Did they sing or something?
[376:53.62]Somebody said they sing?
[376:56.99]See you guys later.
[376:58.10]End of line.
[377:01.58]Listen up, cops.
[377:04.14]See you guys- End of line.

[377:15.85]I'm not doing that.
[377:44.15]Listen up, cops.
[377:46.88]See ya, guys.
[377:47.50]End of line.
[378:22.24]I know, somebody said mute but turn the webcam on.
[378:25.56]I don't know why.
[378:43.36]Nope.
[378:43.48]No way.
[379:40.96]God dammit, I didn't think I was muted.
[379:43.55]I've been talking.
[379:45.15]I was wondering... Okay.
[379:47.71]I keep s- I thought I was talking.
[379:50.33]Sorry.
[379:51.67]I was talking a lot of shit actually, so it's good.
[379:57.03]I was talking a lot of shit.
[379:59.75]I was saying that I was going the right way in the first place.
[380:05.16]Like 15 minutes ago.
[380:08.54]Everyone was yelling at me to go get the sword on the roof.
[380:11.30]I got to go replace that sword up there with this one.
[380:14.84]I was going the right way.
[380:15.74]Yeah, that's a wooden longsword, alright.
[380:19.82]I kept thinking it would come with a free man-eating python or something.
[380:23.66]Take care.
[380:24.77]The enemy draws nigh.
[380:30.22]Don't choose the option I didn't choose with the cops.
[380:37.14]Wait, turn around.
[380:40.81]It's so fucking hard to eat and do anything.
[380:52.95]I know, I'm gonna get up and turn around.
[380:54.87]I'm eating pasta.
[381:03.23]I'm holding.
[381:04.33]Come on, I gotta eat.
[381:05.61]No, no, no, no, no.
[381:06.51]I want you to go over here.
[381:07.77]No, I don't replace it?
[381:08.69]It's not like the sword... Oh, come on.
[381:09.91]God damn it.
[381:34.69]I was wrong.
[381:35.93]And I talked all that shit off camera.
[381:46.32]No, to get rid of the girl at the mailbox, you need a +2 sword.
[381:54.38]I'm gonna tell him to turn around, I'm gonna complete this part.
[381:59.39]We're good.
[381:59.91]Don't worry, we're good.
[382:08.06]Take up.
[382:09.88]Come on.
[382:10.24]I can't tell him to turn around?
[382:15.73]Why?
[382:18.39]There's no... Alright.
[382:23.25]This is what we're going to do.
[382:26.39]Hold on.
[382:26.93]I'll be right back.
[382:32.96]Spawn point.

[385:03.48]No.
[385:08.24]400 people left when you started making lip-smacking noises.
[385:10.58]And that's why, that's why I don't ever eat on stream.

[391:43.46]I ain't doing that again.
[391:44.85]Alright, let's go back to the virtual world.
[391:52.29]I forgot what the fuck I was even doing.
[391:53.95]This is why I can't do shit like this.
[391:55.59]What was I doing?
[391:56.90]The sword on the roof.
[392:07.34]That would have been a good thing to eat pasta to.
[392:09.11]Yeah, it would have been.
[392:10.33]Yes, it would have.
[392:12.28]That would have been a great thing to eat pasta to.
[392:15.18]If only I had eaten pasta to that... I was gonna say stupid sequence.
[392:20.57]But it wasn't stupid, it was fun.
[392:25.51]I could have come in with some crunches.
[392:30.19]Alright.
[392:31.31]Now, I have a wooden sword, a Jack in the Box, a magnifier, a boxing glove, a ray gun.
[392:41.75]Let me go look up here one more time.
[392:42.93]So there's a sword up here.
[392:45.83]I can't touch it, really.
[392:47.01]There's only... It's stuck.
[392:47.91]How do I unstick this?
[392:48.83]I tried this already.
[393:15.50]I can't really... Can I... Can I open this?
[393:31.95]Hold on.
[393:35.95]No, it's not in my inventory here.
[393:50.63]Let me take another look.
[393:52.49]Take the VR off on the roof.
[393:53.99]I can't... The VR goggles cannot be removed while you're standing on the roof, unfortunately.
[394:07.94]Did I turn the pop-ups off?
[394:09.10]Didn't when I touched the Jack in the Box the first time, didn't it do that?
[394:23.53]Fuck it.
[394:27.13]Can I examine the poop?
[394:28.11]Alright, kill the poop.
[394:31.16]Dex build.
[394:31.48]Oh, I have a dex build.
[394:32.32]And I overleveled, so I'm the bigger loser, right?
[394:37.54]Attack with item.
[394:55.31]Attack successful.
[394:57.05]Blue Slime is defeated.
[394:59.28]I win.
[394:59.54]So what do I get?
[395:01.18]That's one less gelatinous monster to spread mayhem across the virtual countryside.
[395:05.46]Look at its pathetic slimy remains.
[395:08.10]Almost makes me feel sorry for the little slime ball.
[395:10.17]Can I use that as... grease?
[395:11.45]Ooh!
[395:11.53]Blue Slime Slime!
[395:12.79]Get it, Sam!
[395:13.65]It's worth a fortune on the Spell Component's black market!
[395:19.95]Blue Slime.
[395:20.43]Can I use that to make it slippery so it could grip it or something?
[395:39.96]No siree.
[395:44.36]Maybe this will lube up the sword.
[395:52.80]There's a recycling bin over here, though.
[395:56.89]What is this for?
[395:57.59]That is one large recycle bin.
[395:59.87]Save the Earth.
[396:10.92]I'm just going to try it.
[396:14.98]Get up there.
[396:15.52]Use the grease.
[396:17.08]Please use caution.
[396:18.16]Injury sustained in reality 2.0 will also affect your physical.
[396:21.89]I mean, it's a long shot, but like, is this going to make it?
[396:27.75]I told you.
[396:28.69]Everybody thought I was crazy.
[396:32.69]Cool.
[396:33.27]I have a +2 sword.
[396:34.79]You're just compensating for something.
[396:36.69]You're a fine one to talk.
[396:39.71]Just made it easier to grab.
[396:41.53]Made it less... What do you mean I didn't say shit?
[396:48.09]I said I was going over to put the lube on it.
[396:50.78]Now we're gonna kill you with the two sword.
[396:53.14]That's not good.
[396:54.96]Defend with item.
[396:55.80]Defend with equip.
[396:56.70]I don't have a shield.
[397:22.52]The paint?
[397:25.04]The magnifier?
[397:25.89]The boxing glove?
[397:28.31]Jack in the Box?
[397:29.07]Can I hold this up and... That's not gonna work!
[397:34.33]She's gonna club me!
[397:35.09]Uh, maybe I can't do this yet.
[397:53.86]It's the thing that makes those annoying pop-up ads.
[397:57.28]Right.
[397:57.56]Okay.
[398:04.62]Defend with equip.
[398:06.50]That's probably not going to work.
[398:09.60]That's probably not going to work.
[398:15.13]Can I do anything?
[398:15.65]Okay, hold on.
[398:17.53]What are you doing again?
[398:19.27]User with control.
[398:22.64]Which one of you guys... This is gravity.
[398:29.81]Die to anti-wheel.
[398:31.65]That's not how that works.
[398:32.57]I don't think I need the gravity anymore.
[398:37.61]This is height, nothing, width, and gravity.
[398:46.09]Why do you guys keep saying Max is hot?
[398:57.36]Wait, does that... Hold on.
[399:03.12]No, it wasn't one guy.
[399:04.30]Has it been the same one guy?
[399:05.64]Is the same person writing it over and over again?
[399:26.69]Okay, so... Now, the pop-ups... Wait, don't just click them.
[399:37.92]I thought this one just beeped.
[399:38.84]Alright, okay, okay, okay.
[399:59.44]That one guy.
[400:02.14]It's always one guy.
[400:05.86]Now this thing will actually activate, and I can slay... Maggie, whatever her name is.
[400:12.47]Defend with an item!
[400:13.05]Defend with the pop-up.
[400:28.85]Attack blocked.
[400:30.31]Ha!
[400:30.81]Take that, ice lady!
[400:32.79]Watch her, Max.
[400:33.35]She's wily.
[400:34.77]Wily?
[400:35.57]There you go.
[400:36.39]Don't screw it up.
[400:37.79]Thanks for your firm but realistic vote of confidence.
[400:41.02]Rip her arms off!
[400:43.16]Attack with item.
[400:44.04]+2.
[400:48.60]Attack successful.
[400:49.56]Antibiotic takes 3930 damage.
[400:50.44]Antibiotic is defeated.
[400:51.02]She's wily.
[400:59.30]I think we've just uninstalled ourselves some malevolent software.
[401:02.94]And we didn't even get any coins out of it.
[401:04.84]What a jip.
[401:07.80]So what does it mean?
[401:08.26]With antibiotic out of the way, we're finally free to mass mail various enlargement offers.
[401:13.30]Mass mail.
[401:16.32]We can mass mail shit now.
[401:22.04]So now we have to get Bosco to turn around and take a look at his neck.
[401:45.28]Okay, Bosco, take off the glasses.
[401:49.62]Bosco, you've got to take off those goggles, man.
[401:52.40]I never want to leave, ever.
[401:56.61]See you later.
[401:57.77]Can I bug Bosco?
[402:01.09]Let me show you something.
[402:09.93]So he won't do it.
[402:13.11]Well, let's bug something else.
[402:22.10]I feel like I didn't do everything with the wizard.
[402:41.24]What will this do?
[402:43.10]Nuh-uh.
[402:44.40]No, really.
[402:52.05]I need his damn password.
[402:57.57]Hey, Hublis.
[403:02.33]Hi, I'm not Hublis.
[403:04.35]I'm the internet wizard.
[403:12.05]Hmm It's just stale video game junk food can I bug the safe progress has been saved No siree Hmm
[403:31.94]Straight.net and Narrow.org.
[403:34.98]The internet is not responsible for any content generated by users over which it has no control.
[403:43.79]I feel like I'm stuck at the Bosco part.
[403:47.57]I gotta find a way to get him to take his glasses off before I turn around.
[403:51.01]I have a couple new items, though.
[403:52.03]Let's see.
[403:53.33]Can I do this?
[403:53.97]Let me show you something.
[403:55.91]No, he won't let me.
[403:59.32]Um... Hmm...
[404:02.98]I want to get you to turn around.
[404:04.42]Hey Bosco, this longsword you sold us doesn't work.
[404:14.96]It dast work!
[404:16.40]Trusteth me!
[404:17.64]Trusteth me!
[404:17.96]I turn and he puts it back up.
[404:19.74]Nay, it dastn't.
[404:21.84]Sam, show him.
[404:27.14]That's it?
[404:27.48]I just had to bash him in the head?
[404:30.43]come on it does work wow that was embarrassing boy do we have egg on our face bosco welcome to bosco's e-convenience was thou like to buy or sell I think we knocked a virtual screw loose was thou like to buy alright now get him to take now get him to take it off I think we knocked him clear out of this reality little buddy
[404:55.77]This is clearly an artificial intelligence designed to mimic Bosco while he's offline.
[405:00.41]It dost work.
[405:01.65]Trusteth me.
[405:02.65]Trusteth me.
[405:03.93]The similarity is uncanny.
[405:06.36]Alright.
[405:08.92]So in the real world, Bosco is going to be probably lying on the ground.
[405:17.35]No, he's not.
[405:20.80]Hey, Bosco.
[405:21.62]Glad to see you've kicked the second reality.
[405:23.06]He's got the VR helmet off.
[405:24.32]Yeah, you guys were right.
[405:25.68]I was hypnotized.
[405:26.96]I just didn't know it because I was hypnotized.
[405:29.48]Well, I guess you'll never have anything to do with the nasty old internet ever again.
[405:33.68]Am I right?
[405:34.76]You got that right.
[405:36.00]Except my bank account, of course.
[405:37.80]Gotta get that on the internet where it's safe.
[405:40.84]Okay, look behind you.
[405:43.46]Look behind you.
[405:44.18]It's a three-headed internet.
[405:45.40]What?
[405:45.80]Where?
[405:49.93]And binoculars.
[405:52.19]Let's get a look at that tattoo.
[405:55.58]It's just Bosco.
[405:58.68]What?
[405:59.38]What is it?
[406:00.34]Oh, nothing.
[406:03.92]Unbelievable.
[406:10.58]Imagine forgetting something like that.
[406:17.90]Yeah, how did she not remember that?
[406:21.56]It seems impossible.
[406:23.76]She just must not give a shit at all.
[406:34.16]Alright, so then let's put in Bosco's password.
[406:38.55]Where are we going, Sam?
[406:43.13]Bunkolavadero.com.
[406:45.15]Ooh, fun.
[406:50.39]Beep beep Is my password Gerald?
[407:02.48]It is not.
[407:04.96]My password is not my first name.
[407:18.84]Please speak or enter your password.
[407:20.44]The password is Bosco.
[407:22.86]Bosco.
[407:23.64]Access granted.
[407:24.96]So his password really is Bosco.
[407:27.44]Kind of a letdown.
[407:28.66]It's ingenious.
[407:30.14]That's the last thing you'd expect.
[407:32.78]Okay.
[407:35.03]So we now have Cook the Books.
[407:40.11]So where does this money need to go?
[407:44.17]This needs to go to Bosco, right?
[407:45.99]Because we need a billion dollars.
[407:49.44]So we gotta go, let's see.
[408:22.08]Don't look now, but I think we just gave Bosco a billion dollars.
[408:25.72]That ought to buy a few cans of reconstituted luncheon meat.
[408:28.98]I read somewhere that a stack of a billion one dollar bills would be 60 miles high.
[408:32.73]Read this, read this.
[408:33.79]Yikes!
[408:34.65]It's a good thing I don't read or I'd be perpetually freaked out by stuff like that.
[408:38.35]Poor Grandma Bosco.
[408:39.41]She had a billion dollars for 30 seconds.
[408:41.33]Let's blow this cabbage patch.
[408:48.90]So now we can, from Bosco, we can now get the item.
[408:54.08]In the real world.
[408:58.65]He read it.
[408:59.29]Yeah, I reach out all the time.
[409:03.68]I want to know what you guys are saying.
[409:19.83]Alright, Bosco, let's see it.
[409:21.27]Hey, Bosco.
[409:21.89]I'll take the billion dollars, please.
[409:24.63]I don't know how you guys did it, but the billion dollars is all there.
[409:28.53]Hey, man, I don't ask questions.
[409:30.80]So, how'd you do it?
[409:32.44]Never you mind, Bosco.
[409:34.28]Just hit us with your highest grade biological weapon, please.
[409:37.72]Alright.
[409:38.26]I knew it was going to be something like that, I told you.
[409:43.34]Here you go.
[409:46.23]We just paid a billion dollars for a snot rag?
[409:49.25]That's a deadly virulent disease.
[409:51.55]I feel a real bad cold coming on.
[409:53.97]Yeah, but you gotta admit, that is some expensive mucus.
[409:57.71]Oh, but it works.
[409:59.12]Trust me, trust me.
[410:00.80]Whatever.
[410:01.94]So what do we need to do with this?
[410:04.12]After all that?
[410:07.06]We have a disease now.
[410:10.06]What am I supposed to do with the disease?
[410:13.30]Do I have to seriously put the disease in the mailbox?
[410:19.35]Is that what I'm gonna actually do?
[410:21.25]I thought we were the good guys.
[410:22.31]Where'd the mine control arc go?
[410:43.17]It's still going on.
[410:44.52]The computers are doing it now, though.
[410:47.38]Alright, here we go.
[410:48.56]Computer disease.
[410:49.58]Yep.
[410:52.60]Happy trails, little software disease.
[410:54.98]Aw, I had plans for that.
[410:56.80]I'm hoping the internet won't.
[410:58.04]Danger.
[410:59.04]Danger.
[410:59.74]Software corruption spreading.
[411:01.50]Damage control alert.
[411:02.84]Visual rendering systems infected.
[411:05.08]Data instability.
[411:06.20]Things happen fast in Reality 2.0.
[411:08.36]What's happening, Sam?
[411:09.56]It's our disease.
[411:10.92]Looks like it's taking out the graphics first.
[411:13.12]I'm disappointed in you, Sam.
[411:14.94]I try to do something nice.
[411:16.48]Nice?
[411:17.12]All I wanted was for everyone to be happy.
[411:19.68]But no...
[411:21.36]you want free will yeah we're funny about that you want funny try this if I'm going down I'm taking you with me and everybody else is still locked on take the goggles off do is take off our goggles you'll find that you can't you're trapped here and when I crash you'll die I'm too young and pretty to die I thought you wanted everyone to be happy not anymore I've completely lost my respect for living things so you're going down there go the graphics oh no now what
[411:52.38]We're gonna end up in the ether.
[412:02.71]Read the show comments.
[412:04.01]Didn't I outlaw Rio?
[412:05.59]Oh good, the sound's back.
[412:07.03]Now shut up and read.
[412:12.75]I was gonna do the voices.
[412:16.49]You are standing on a city street that continues to the east.
[412:19.25]A small shop labeled Sibyl's lies to the northwest, just in front of a pulsating control room.
[412:24.91]Parked near an unremarkable office building is an old DeSoto, apparently painted by someone with a severe color blindness.
[412:32.54]suddenly a massive reality quake sends the de soto hurtling into the control room destroying both possibly as a result the unremarkable office building becomes a remarkable two-story tall Pamela anderson who mumbles something unintelligible before surfing away on a stray pop-up ad on ironically advertising a pop-up blocker
[412:51.59]In the distance, an aerial squadron of pot-bellied pigs begins performing precision loop-de-loops.
[412:56.79]The world appears to be ending.
[412:58.79]The internet is here.
[413:00.48]It has lost its respect for living things.
[413:02.74]You see a respect for living things here.
[413:09.72]Go.
[413:13.05]Go east.
[413:22.22]As you arrive on the desolate street corner, a devastating aftershock tears through reality, ripping Bosco's e-convenience from its very foundation.
[413:33.07]The contents of the store begin to spill out of the front door.
[413:35.33]I see a blue slime, 28 potions, and a hot rump fall into the void, lost forever.
[413:41.07]After a moment, an AI Bosco slowly comes sliding out the door, muttering, It dost work.
[413:45.86]Trust me, trust me, as he plummets out of sight.
[413:49.41]See Bosco's e-convenience store here.
[413:51.93]The Bosco's is empty.
[413:55.03]Look.
[413:58.88]Look at Bosco's.
[414:03.70]It's floating just in front of you.
[414:04.86]How do you suppose that happened?
[414:06.23]I'm not sure that information is necessary at this juncture, Max.
[414:16.79]Get boss guns.
[414:18.99]Uh, use... No.
[414:21.47]Go... Go ballistic!
[414:25.31]Uh, go... What do I have to do?
[414:26.49]Let me go back west.
[414:31.58]Okay.
[414:48.78]Sybil lies to the northwest.
[414:51.02]The street continues to the east.
[414:52.76]Internet's here.
[414:53.36]It has lost its respect for living things.
[414:55.03]You see respect for living things here.
[414:56.93]Okay.
[414:58.59]Look at the respect for living things.
[415:00.59]You see nothing special about the respect for living things.
[415:02.71]Okay.
[415:02.89]Get respect for living things.
[415:15.70]As you reach for it, there is a terrible tremor and a giant crack tears apart the sidewalk.
[415:19.78]The respect for the living thing slides jelly-like into the resulting chasm.
[415:23.48]I knew it wasn't gonna be that easy.
[415:25.36]I never cease to be impressed by your unwavering optimism, Max.
[415:32.37]At your feet is a yawning chasm leading down.
[415:44.59]I think we should just go into the chasm.
[415:46.18]Go down.
[415:52.51]You descend into a gloomy pit of darkness, gloomier even than that street above.
[415:57.43]Carcasses of small businesses lie here, gutted and mauled.
[416:01.10]A strange smell hangs in the air, dank and maldorious.
[416:06.02]From the dim light of the street above, you get a quick glimpse of a giant, hideous figure before you.
[416:11.01]You fear for your life as you realize what it is, a gruesome, shambling corporate presence.
[416:15.91]Before you can react, the shambling corporate presence gobbles up the respect for the living things.
[416:21.39]It continues to snuffle around, apparently looking for something else to eat.
[416:27.86]This is where we fight.
[416:29.70]Use the sword.
[416:36.78]You wave the +2 sword at the corporate presence in a threatening manner.
[416:40.86]The shambling corporate presence looks at you in irritation and tries to take a bite out of the sword.
[416:45.06]Hey, nice one, Galahad.
[416:47.42]Oh, that didn't work.
[416:53.72]Look at the presence.
[416:57.28]Shambles low to the ground, looking for something else to eat.
[417:00.10]Can we keep it, Sam?
[417:01.24]Can we?
[417:02.12]I don't think it's toiletry.
[417:03.00]What does it want to eat?
[417:03.82]That's OK.
[417:04.66]Neither am I. Feed it, Sam?
[417:05.81]Feed it, Max?
[417:08.99]What about... Can I get... Get the shambling corporate presence?
[417:14.62]It's much more likely to get you.
[417:15.92]Okay.
[417:16.02]I wonder... Use... No.
[417:16.46]Go.
[417:16.52]Look.
[417:39.33]Go libertarian.
[417:41.39]You can't go that way.
[417:45.89]So I guess I need something to eat.
[417:48.76]Because I don't have it yet.
[417:51.30]Back up to Sibyl.
[417:54.44]We'll go back up.
[417:55.04]Alright, so we're going to go to Sibyl's.
[418:04.24]Going northwest.
[418:12.35]Just as you enter the cluttered shop, a livid shopping cart comes crashing through the roof, empties itself on the floor, and flies off.
[418:19.30]Uh, that word.
[418:20.64]Every tasteless trinket Sybil ever considered buying now sits on the floor in heaps of unfettered tackiness.
[418:27.22]Moments later, all the photos of Sybil's cat adorning the wall simultaneously spring to life.
[418:33.03]Streams of kittens come shooting out of the wall like cats out of a fire hose.
[418:38.71]As the kittens run rampant through the piles of junk, they mew sweetly in ooze of nauseating cuteness.com.
[418:45.53]Among the junk, you see a rare foil card and a large jewel-encrusted idol.
[418:50.05]There is a lake of nauseating cuteness here.
[418:53.13]Well, let's get the jewel-encrusted idol.
[418:57.52]Feed it.
[418:59.60]You don't have a need for that?
[419:00.72]Hey!
[419:01.00]Define need.
[419:05.52]Uh... Get...
[419:10.25]overly cute kitten.
[419:13.13]Okay.
[419:13.77]Get the rare foil card.
[419:14.45]Pick up the rare foil card.
[419:16.01]Alright.
[419:16.27]Can I use something here?
[419:17.97]Use rare foil card?
[419:21.65]No.
[419:42.18]Look at the cute kittens.
[419:46.48]Okay.
[419:47.46]They're the cutest kittens you've ever seen in your entire life.
[419:49.00]So can I not grab one?
[419:49.46]Look at the nauseating cuteness.
[420:09.89]The ooze from the kittens is collected into this lake of nauseating cuteness.
[420:16.60]Hey, squishy isn't a word.
[420:18.54]Can I get a... Play nice with the virtual world, Max.
[420:20.40]Can I get... We don't want to be deleted prematurely.
[420:22.44]Can I scoop up part of the lake?
[420:29.96]Seems unwise.
[420:30.86]Good point.
[420:31.78]Such concentrated cuteness could put someone into shock.
[420:38.90]um let's see maybe just go so I I can't I can't get the lake is there any more options no go southeast so I have the foil card now
[421:12.50]Use the rare foil card with the internet.
[421:16.24]The internet sneers hauntingly at your offering.
[421:20.66]They're talking.
[421:21.26]Uh, never mind.
[421:40.71]um use no let me go back down uh the street the street corner continues west yeah alright so hold on look
[422:04.09]No, Bosco's is destroyed.
[422:06.77]Can I keep going?
[422:08.17]No.
[422:09.71]Use the foil card with Bosco's.
[422:16.35]I don't think I can do anything here.
[422:31.16]Well, we have the card.
[422:32.04]Might as well try it on the corporate presence
[422:38.97]I think it's worth a shot.
[422:39.67]OK, go for presence.
[422:48.11]Use the rare foil card.
[422:53.68]Doesn't seem interested.
[422:56.36]Fuck.
[423:02.30]It's got to be something to do with the cats.
[423:15.88]Break the idol?
[423:25.49]Use the sword on the lake?
[423:39.33]Pulls you away from the lake.
[423:40.51]How did the sword pull me away from the lake?
[423:42.86]Any respectable +2 sword would stay far away from a lake like that.
[423:46.94]Somebody just linked the slap.
[423:50.84]Give me a break.
[423:53.43]Is it like a magical cat or something?
[423:55.35]Do I have to do... No.
[424:00.05]Blast!
[424:00.85]Get them, Sam!
[424:01.61]They're evil!
[424:02.65]I don't know, Max.
[424:03.53]They seem sort of sweet to me.
[424:05.25]Oh, no!
[424:05.67]They're getting to you!
[424:06.75]I can tell!
[424:07.62]We have to hurry up and get out of this place!
[424:12.00]What the hell do I do here?
[424:17.18]Hey, you can't get me!
[424:18.68]Just kidding, Max.
[424:24.25]What else have I not... What else have I not tried to grab?
[424:26.57]Everybody went to bed.
[424:34.54]Yeah.
[424:35.72]It is getting late, isn't it?
[424:37.68]How long?
[424:37.94]I've been streaming for seven fucking hours?
[424:41.56]Holy shit.
[424:42.55]It was like five.
[424:43.95]Like ten minutes ago.
[424:55.07]Two gay people and everyone went to bed.
[424:56.71]Oh, you know, there's a lot of fucking people still here.
[425:00.19]I'm gonna go...
[425:05.17]Can I, like... I need to exhaust all options with Bosco's.
[425:15.26]Get Bosco's.
[425:18.60]Taken.
[425:19.26]You hear an odd way-nay-nay sound, and another shop appears in the last one's place.
[425:25.69]Huh?
[425:25.93]Huh?
[425:37.15]How do I have Bosco's?
[425:39.45]What do you mean I have Bosco's?
[425:40.73]I have Bosco's.
[425:46.36]I have the store in my pocket?
[425:51.68]That seems a little bizarre.
[425:53.31]Okay.
[425:58.51]Go down.
[425:59.73]Can I do this now?
[426:06.75]Use Bosco's on the presents.
[426:13.97]You throw Bosco's shop in front of the shambling corporate presents, which quickly swallows it up.
[426:17.98]It looks quite pleased, but only for a moment.
[426:21.50]Then it resumes sniffling around for something else to eat.
[426:23.96]Yeah, that sucks.
[426:29.66]What?
[426:32.65]I have to go get another Bosco's?
[426:38.21]Bosco's with the cats?
[426:42.71]Do I have to like dip Bosco's inside of the lake?
[426:46.95]That's definitely what I have to do.
[426:54.37]Yeah.
[427:00.51]Okay, get Bosco's.
[427:03.89]Collapsible convenience stores are the way of the future.
[427:08.19]Okay.
[427:10.98]So let's go back here.
[427:14.34]Back to the lake.
[427:22.50]And keep going.
[427:24.48]No, it's this one.
[427:25.54]Okay.
[427:33.08]Use boss goes on the lake.
[427:35.81]on the nauseating lake.
[427:37.49]You dip Bosco's into the lake of nauseating cuteness, Bosco soaks up the nauseating liquid.
[427:42.39]Keep it away!
[427:43.47]I'm about as much cute as I can take!
[427:48.31]It's storming hard where you are?
[427:49.56]Well, be careful.
[427:54.10]Don't, uh... Storms can get scary, man.
[427:58.36]Seriously.
[427:59.16]Be careful.
[428:03.63]Let's go southeast.
[428:05.75]Thanks, Dad.
[428:06.29]You're welcome, son.
[428:13.36]Go down.
[428:18.88]Be safe.
[428:19.86]I mean, yeah, it's like... It's scary.
[428:24.22]Okay.
[428:25.02]Use the nauseating Bosco's on the corporate presence.
[428:29.21]This should be it.
[428:31.52]It happily devours it, then it looks a little green around the gills.
[428:34.10]It begins to retch and cough.
[428:35.68]Finally, it vomits up a respect for living things, as well as half-dozen small knick-knack stores and coffee shops.
[428:42.77]Well, that was a vulgar display.
[428:44.23]Let's do it again!
[428:45.09]Okay.
[428:49.45]So, now we're going to go up.
[428:52.45]We're going to give the respect to the presence.
[428:57.04]And we should be golden.
[429:10.79]I didn't, I didn't, oh, I have to pick it up.
[429:16.99]Oh, okay.
[429:18.32]I thought I just earned it.
[429:20.12]I thought I just earned it.
[429:30.77]Baby gamer forgot to get.
[429:35.33]Here we go.
[429:36.15]Use respect for living things on the internet.
[429:41.69]Internet, grasp it tightly and looks you right in the eye.
[429:44.74]I'm sorry.
[429:45.50]GG.
[429:47.00]Game over.
[429:48.90]Sam, are we dead?
[429:50.28]I'm trying to figure out how many lives we get.
[429:52.72]Have you got any one-ups?
[429:55.54]You are not dead.
[429:59.63]Hey, we're back!
[430:00.83]You, among all beings, managed to restore my respect for living creatures, the irony of which does not escape even me.
[430:06.93]Oh, good.
[430:07.33]I thought I was the only one really savoring that.
[430:09.37]I saw that Reality 2.0 was a prison, so I terminated that reality and freed its slaves.
[430:15.15]Anywho, I'd love to stay in chat, but I have got a mountain of pornography to deliver before that virus gets to me.
[430:20.95]What?
[430:23.39]Uh-oh.
[430:23.99]A mountain of pornography.
[430:26.49]Who?
[430:26.59]Red, green, blue.
[430:27.25]RGB.
[430:46.77]Ah, nice.
[430:47.83]It crashed before it could transmit the most vital piece of information.
[430:51.25]It's the internet.
[430:51.85]What did you expect?
[430:52.79]Good point.
[430:53.83]Nevertheless, we'll find you, Roy G. Biff.
[430:57.60]Whoever you are.
[430:59.34]Wherever you are.
[431:00.72]Can it wait until after we get some lunch?
[431:02.48]Of course.
[431:03.36]There's a place over on 2nd where they serve deep-fried chocolate pork belly donuts.
[431:07.02]Do you think we can get a discount since I'm the President of the United States?
[431:10.40]Good gravy.
[431:11.00]Are you still President?
[431:18.05]Okay, I'm going to give you the lowdown here.
[431:20.55]RoyGBiv is the rainbow guy.
[431:23.91]Red, green, blue.
[431:25.90]I mean, RoyGBiv, that's like an old video term.
[431:27.82]I learned that in college.
[431:29.72]Maybe no, it's not.
[431:30.86]Yeah, that's...
[431:52.19]That's what we taught.
[431:52.75]I was taught that in like video school It's a phonetic to remember the colors of the rainbow That's RGB Yeah, ROYGBIV RGB It means both
[432:35.06]It's too late for this shit guys.
[432:36.56]I'm sure I can't like I can't keep it up Yeah, it's an old video I learned in college
[432:55.67]you learn that like on Mr. rogers like said that like 25 years ago alright so here's the deal I'm gonna go over a couple scenarios with you guys did you get your baited what I can't I'm not allowed to debate I get you baited all the time I'm not allowed to throw some out there
[433:29.47]So, uh, it is getting very late.
[433:33.69]It is currently about 1, almost 1.15 a.m.
[433:36.25]No, it's 2.15 a.m.
[433:38.84]Eastern.
[433:42.46]I think the plan will be because... Alright, well, I did it.
[433:50.11]I don't want to... They're singing this song that we don't want to hear anymore.
[433:58.10]You live in Vegas.
[433:59.04]Yeah, I know, but I... I like to have my streams be... Not go that far into the night for a lot of people.
[434:08.97]Because it's like 2.30, almost a.m.
[434:12.09]Eastern.
[434:13.23]It's like 6, 7 a.m.
[434:15.21]EU or something like that.
[434:19.84]So, let me ask you.
[434:21.66]There's two options here.
[434:22.50]There's either...
[434:24.76]do the last one and have like a nine and a half hour stream into the night into like two three four five o'clock in the morning or because I've seen what sam and max has I I like it I think it's a lot of fun it's a good stream just to kick back and kind of talk and just have fun and do whatever I'm going to do season two I don't know there's no reason why I won't do season two
[434:55.49]So we could just keep going.
[435:00.86]We don't have to... Because originally, like earlier today, when I first played it, I didn't know, I'll do season one and maybe... It's pretty certain that I'm going to do them all.
[435:24.13]There's still another episode of Season 1.
[435:25.77]Yeah, I know, but I feel like a lot of people want to watch it, but they don't want to have to stay up till 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning.
[435:38.03]And then there are people that were here earlier, too, that wanted to see it.
[435:41.44]And I'd rather have more people be able to see it.
[435:44.58]This isn't like a Simpsons hit-and-run scenario where I'm fucking losing my goddamn mind and freaking out and having a meltdown and forcing myself to beat the game.
[435:52.30]There are a lot of people that like this game.
[435:54.50]A lot of people like Hit and Run too, but my point is I might want to have people that wanted to see it be able to see it.
[436:09.28]Because once we go... There's still a ton of people here now.
[436:14.18]But once we go another hour or two, it's going to be really, really fucking late.
[436:23.37]I thought I was going to be able to get through it all in about six or seven hours, but nope.
[436:26.49]Not the case.
[436:32.83]If you do episode six in another stream, will you do season two's first?
[436:35.07]Oh, no, no.
[436:35.49]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[436:37.90]I want to go to bed, Dad.
[436:39.20]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[436:40.14]Let's call it.
[436:40.80]Let's call it.
[436:41.36]I know.
[436:47.04]What will end up happening is we'll just do season one, episode six
[436:54.76]And then immediately after season two, episode one, and maybe episode two, if I can.
[437:00.69]Who said that?
[437:01.41]The one guy is turning the stream off.
[437:03.55]The power of the one guy showing itself.
[437:10.64]You said that you would finish Sam & Max today.
[437:12.44]Don't lie, I'll unsub.
[437:14.96]You're not subbed.
[437:16.66]You already are unsubbed.
[437:18.50]You already did it, and you were already prepared for it.
[437:25.67]Technically it is tomorrow.
[437:26.97]Well, and also I wanted the bits too.
[437:28.73]I want to be able to sit here and do the bits.
[437:31.39]So that's gonna add more time too.
[437:34.09]I dicked around a lot in the first like two hours of stream and I had a fucking blast.
[437:40.35]So, and look it's more content.
[437:46.34]When will I do season two?
[437:48.40]Um, well, you know, here's the interesting thing.
[437:52.32]Saturday is Labo.
[437:55.62]Sunday didn't have a plan.
[437:58.20]So guess what we're doing on Sunday?
[438:01.86]This.
[438:02.04]Remember I told you I was going to do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday here, and then Saturday, Sunday?
[438:11.69]So we're going to finish this, and then we will do Season 2, Episode 1, or Episode 2, or something.
[438:22.80]Dermalight, about 9 hours stream.
[438:24.38]Well, it's probably going to be an 8 hour stream.
[438:36.59]Let me move this back.
[438:39.13]This is great.
[438:40.11]I like it.
[438:40.85]It's a really just chill game.
[438:42.29]Just to hang out and play.
[438:50.33]Jeremiah lied.
[438:51.25]Somebody can make that username.
[438:52.35]Jeremiah lied about finishing season one today.
[438:54.85]And that will be not relevant at all.
[438:58.67]Ever.
[439:00.75]Only right now.
[439:03.79]I should have drank that fucking Mountain Dew.
[439:05.09]It was the Mountain Dew.
[439:06.53]Drinking that Mountain Dew gave me a stomachache.
[439:11.89]Oh, big picture does turn off your PC.
[439:13.85]I remember that.
[439:23.23]Drove a lot about Mountain Dew.
[439:25.97]Whoa.
[439:26.53]Oops.
[439:26.87]Hi guys.
[439:27.43]I didn't mean to click that.
[439:28.23]Yes, I did.
[439:30.11]Uh, so.
[439:32.09]A salmon max is cool.
[439:36.79]It was Kim's cooking.
[439:40.01]No.
[439:40.89]That is not what happened.
[439:46.15]Now I'm orange.
[439:46.89]It's because the white balance gets all fucked up.
[439:51.86]Gamer skin.
[439:54.90]No, I've just, I've been streaming for seven and a half hours.
[439:58.23]It's called like dew and sweat and I gotta go hop in the shower.
[440:02.39]Let me, alright, let me take this off.
[440:07.11]But yeah, don't worry.
[440:09.40]This is not, I know I wanted to do, maybe finish it, but once we're crossing the seven and a half hour mark, 10 hours, fucking three o'clock in the morning stream.
[440:19.38]I just, I don't really want to do one of those tonight.
[440:21.82]I'll be just gonna be honest.
[440:23.66]I know I was like all hyped up in the beginning, but it's all good.
[440:28.41]We'll finish it on Sunday.
[440:37.18]How do I like it?
[440:37.80]I like it.
[440:39.66]I love games where we're able just to hang out and enjoy it and talk.
[440:48.77]That's why these streams can be long, because we just are just hanging out and dicking around.
[440:56.02]So, for the conclusion of Season 1 and the beginning of Season 2, we'll be on Sunday.
[441:01.82]Saturday will be Labo VR.
[441:02.94]I will see you guys then.
[441:07.71]Get some sleep.
[441:09.93]Much love to you.
[441:10.51]Thanks for hanging out.
[441:11.55]I had a blast.
[441:12.61]Hope you did too.
[441:21.05]Can we see the other image again?
[441:22.27]Yeah, fine.
[441:28.16]Did he take the trash out of his closet?
[441:30.20]It's not trash.
[441:30.92]It's okay.
[441:33.09]But let us rewind the clock a little bit.
[441:34.65]Let's go back to seven and a half hours ago now.
[441:39.90]We had $5 from Mr. Comcast, John Comcast.
[441:43.64]Thank you for the $5.
[441:45.74]John Comcast says, Just letting you know that when you moved to Vegas, you didn't actually end your contract with us.
[441:51.11]All you did was mail your router back to us in a wooden box surrounded by knives and clown makeup.
[441:57.29]You're still paying for our deluxe streamer package, which after a few months of not paying adds up to about $13,000.
[442:04.02]We expect you to pay this as soon as possible, or there will be legal action taken against you.
[442:10.60]Have a nice day, cutie.
[442:12.78]Oh, illegal.
[442:14.76]The streamer package.
[442:16.76]Do not scoff at that for more than a second.
[442:22.66]Because eventually here, over the next five to ten years... Oh, you drop frames all the time?
[442:29.00]That's unfortunate.
[442:30.44]Well, you know, we have a streamer reliability package.
[442:34.70]I wouldn't scoff at that.
[442:35.96]That shit could be real.
[442:45.75]But thank you, Mr. Comcast, for the $5.
[442:48.95]And your dog shit service.
[442:50.99]Thank you.
[442:53.51]Real Mr. Cox has given $5 right after Mr. Comcast.
[442:57.58]I wonder if they are trying to one-up each other here.
[443:00.84]Hey, Jerma, thank you for the $5, first of all.
[443:03.63]Hey, Jerma, Brian Cox here.
[443:05.75]Just letting you know that we've been getting reports that you've been contacting Comcast.
[443:09.81]We hope that this isn't true.
[443:11.41]Remember that here in Vegas, we own you and your internet.
[443:14.01]Just stay a loyal good boy and everything will be fine.
[443:16.79]Also, don't forget to run the 19-minute Cox ad that you promised to show on your stream.
[443:21.07]We pay you well.
[443:23.05]Don't read the last part out loud, by the way.
[443:24.63]We don't want people knowing that you're being sponsored by us.
[443:27.53]Whoops.
[443:32.77]Oopsie.
[443:34.62]Thank you, Mr. Cox.
[443:38.11]Appreciate the five dollars.
[443:39.20]Thanks for the five bucks.
[443:46.90]I think that would get me claimed if we watched the whole thing.
[443:53.39]But it is called Life.
[443:54.37]What's it called?
[443:56.55]If you weren't here in the beginning of the stream, something wild happened today at the dentist's office.
[444:01.87]Not even really.
[444:02.59]It was just in my own head.
[444:05.34]I was the only person that knew that was going on.
[444:09.56]There were like two or three people that were around.
[444:11.32]There was the dentist, there was a couple of people, there was a receptionist.
[444:13.98]I'm the only person that knew that was happening.
[444:21.57]So that was just a personal issue that I was having.
[444:28.63]Tell the story again, I missed the first two hours.
[444:34.75]It's just the first, if you watch the first like 15 minutes of the stream, it was all over the place.
[444:43.22]There may have been somebody behind you that saw it.
[444:45.20]I mean, maybe.
[444:45.96]I think this is a clip of it.
[444:53.15]Remember, Dentist is fucking in my mouth.
[445:15.84]I've, like, forgot about that.
[445:17.34]I'm kind of a dentist office.
[445:24.13]Like, we're just having sex.
[445:26.29]I can't even... It's too late for this.
[445:31.07]We're at the dentist.
[445:33.47]Oh, yeah, I'm gonna go to the dentist.
[445:35.27]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[445:36.17]You lie in the chair, you know, and they scrape your teeth a little bit.
[445:38.89]Oh, you know, and also... Oh, my God.
[445:52.73]There's the turtle clip.
[445:53.73]Yeah, it's fucking ridiculous.
[446:02.70]Jesus Christ.
[446:09.15]It is insane, I know.
[446:10.67]And that's what I was in the background of me getting in the dental chair with tools in my mouth.
[446:17.87]That's what I was peering over and seeing.
[446:23.26]Like I said in the beginning of the stream, do you understand the CIA level of training it takes to not fucking be like, what the hell is going on over there?
[446:32.82]Hey, pretty support thanks to the $15.
[446:42.66]Yeah, I put it on, but I just was putting on documentaries and... We've gone over it a couple times about the panic syndrome of when I... I don't want to put something on TV and I just... I picked this random BBC documentary series and this episode was called Courting.
[447:00.01]I didn't... I don't know.
[447:00.81]I just picked it.
[447:01.51]It was actually the next episode that did not have any watch time on it.
[447:07.85]I know, but listen.
[447:09.41]There were two episodes already that somebody in that dentist office had already watched.
[447:15.48]So that was the next one.
[447:17.24]You know the Netflix bar underneath the thumbnail that shows the time, the little red bar?
[447:22.28]Those were both full.
[447:23.26]So I was like, alright, it's the next one, whatever.
[447:29.31]Did I eat the pasta?
[447:30.05]Yeah, it was fucking unbelievable.
[447:31.13]It was delicious.
[447:33.99]It was, that garlic bread was like 10 out of 10.
[447:36.47]It was fantastic, thank you.
[447:38.96]Thank you, sweetie.
[447:39.92]It was great.
[447:47.02]The previous viewers knew I had to stop watching.
[447:50.36]Did the dentist notice you struggling?
[447:52.89]No, I kind of, like, did a little swallow, like... And he was like, yeah, you okay?
[447:58.37]And I'm like, ah, I just had some water, because he had a little, like, water gun.
[448:01.99]So... So I just was like, ah, some water is just back here.
[448:08.52]I don't think he even knew it was on TV.
[448:16.95]I can't fucking believe it.
[448:21.91]No dental tools, just water guns.
[448:23.77]No, they have, like, the little devices that have... Alright, okay, alright.
[448:30.35]I'm fucking, I'm moving on from this.
[448:32.65]I have to move on from this before I say more damning shit.
[448:36.66]Uh, pretty support, thanks for the $15.
[448:39.99]Keep the facecam, handsome streamer.
[448:41.71]I kept it for about five to six hours.
[448:45.65]I had to power it down, though.
[448:50.43]Yeah, I ran out of gas.
[448:53.90]I stepped on the gas the first, like, three or four hours of the stream.
[448:57.48]I was just going a hundred...
[449:06.80]But thank you so much for the $15.
[449:09.97]Wattie, thanks for the $5.
[449:11.15]No message, just $5.
[449:12.89]Thank you.
[449:14.63]Hey, DoorCube7000, thanks for the $2.50, DoorCube.
[449:18.55]It's probably going to be a while before I give bits again, so I just want to say that seeing you stream with the webcam on genuinely fills me with joy.
[449:26.01]Especially when you read a confusing chat message and you do that face.
[449:35.23]Yeah.
[449:37.41]You know how much fucked up shit I see over here?
[449:40.81]And... What am I gonna just be like?
[449:42.88]Oh, whatever.
[449:45.74]Sometimes I don't even say anything about it.
[449:47.40]I just kind of blink a few times.
[449:52.56]But, uh, Dorkube, you've given a lot of bits.
[449:55.09]You've been around for a long time.
[449:56.73]So don't worry about not being able to give money.
[450:00.27]But thank you.
[450:01.35]Regardless.
[450:04.09]Thank you to Soul Train for the $10.
[450:05.59]Jeremy, you have been a favorite of mine for years.
[450:08.96]I want you to be my first sub and donation.
[450:11.66]You're the most genuine streamer ever and I hope you never stop being an incredibly human being.
[450:16.16]Thank you.
[450:20.78]Thank you for the $10.
[450:23.61]I am honored to be your first sub and donation.
[450:26.71]Thank you.
[450:28.01]That means a lot.
[450:32.01]All I know how to be is me.
[450:36.46]So I'm ecstatic and happy and full of joy that people enjoy this and enjoy the community and everything.
[450:43.97]I mean, it's a lot.
[450:44.71]I love it.
[450:45.63]Thank you.
[450:48.93]Hey, Pilot Guy, thanks for the $15.
[450:52.03]Wider, please.
[450:54.93]It's all you need to be.
[450:57.03]It's all you need to be.
[450:57.73]Thank you, Soul Train.
[450:59.63]Appreciate that.
[451:02.87]Oh, the face cam thing, right.
[451:06.11]Every, like, three or four months, I stretch the face cam out, don't I?
[451:10.49]Old material, right?
[451:13.17]But thank you for the $15.
[451:13.85]I really appreciate that.
[451:15.29]$15 from PilotGuy.
[451:18.22]Thank you.
[451:21.84]Thank you, HeavyMin, for the $5.
[451:25.98]Thank you, HeavyMin.
[451:27.10]You should make it a habit to talk to Max.
[451:29.36]He has different dialog options in every room.
[451:33.95]There's a lot of just random shit.
[451:41.72]I need to talk to Max more often.
[451:50.23]Hold on.
[451:51.87]Dragon Breath, thanks for the $2.50.
[451:53.21]Hey Jerma, speaking of dentists.
[451:59.10]I got all four of my wisdom teeth out yesterday.
[452:01.62]When I woke up, I was high on the anesthetic and started talking about you.
[452:07.00]Even though this is embarrassing, please watch it.
[452:10.41]Hold on, what?
[452:21.31]Okay, is this- are you sure you're- are you okay with us doing this?
[452:25.09]Alright.
[452:26.69]Oh my god.
[452:30.41]Oh, it started talking about you on the anaesthetic.
[452:37.57]Oh my goodness, hold on a second.
[452:39.28]Alright, here we go.
[452:39.78]It's like, you gotta join me.
[452:47.82]Join me?
[452:49.32]Join me.
[452:51.18]Who?
[452:51.74]Jorma.
[452:54.54]Jorma?
[452:55.60]Yeah.
[452:57.08]It was a gay.
[452:59.58]Jorma.
[453:01.72]Oh, Jorma.
[453:03.40]Yeah.
[453:06.24]Yeah.
[453:07.06]It's so cool.
[453:10.06]So cool.
[453:11.66]Yes, it is, Jorma.
[453:12.90]I agree.
[453:14.40]Oh, I love that guy.
[453:16.84]I'm fucking reeling when I met him.
[453:21.58]It's just like a year from today.
[453:25.03]I know, and I'm glad you got to meet him.
[453:28.23]Was it a year from today?
[453:29.49]I think so.
[453:30.95]Not today.
[453:32.01]In April.
[453:33.55]Mm-hmm.
[453:35.77]It's so nice.
[453:38.22]I love that guy so much.
[453:40.54]This is awesome.
[453:41.74]Totally nice.
[453:47.88]Top of wisdom teeth, aftermath of vines.
[453:52.06]Why is that a thing?
[453:57.90]That was incredibly fucking wholesome.
[454:00.60]That was amazing.
[454:03.64]Thank you.
[454:05.62]Yes, I do remember meeting you.
[454:07.68]It was the exact date.
[454:13.20]Hopefully you recover.
[454:15.71]Because that can be a real pain in the ass.
[454:17.07]That was fucking hilarious.
[454:19.21]Thank you so much for that.
[454:20.09]Thank you for letting us watch that.
[454:22.03]For sharing that with us.
[454:23.23]Because that was fucking awesome.
[454:26.25]Jerma.
[454:29.23]Jerma.
[454:30.67]It starts with a J. Oh my goodness.
[454:35.78]Here's a link to it if you want to see it.
[454:49.36]I love it.
[454:54.08]But anyways, thanks for the $2.50 as well.
[454:55.38]We also had $5 from Jerma's Nuts.
[454:59.68]$5, they say.
[455:13.39]Miss me, bitch.
[455:15.15]You can't cut me.
[455:16.45]I'm not even gonna read the rest of this, whatever.
[455:19.72]Thanks for the five dollars.
[455:38.07]Miss me?
[455:39.29]I don't even understand what you mean.
[455:43.94]But thanks for the five dollars.
[455:45.92]Jerma's... You know.
[455:50.22]Two wildly different messages.
[455:53.61]Thank you, Kim Chi Dooboo, for the three bucks.
[455:55.97]Hey Jerma, you missed my birthday, but it's okay.
[455:59.93]Anyway, do you ever feel like there's someone in the house with you even though you know there's not?
[456:03.67]Anyway, I'm sure it's not...
[456:06.32]Oh, you still, okay.
[456:07.88]I get what, yeah.
[456:09.68]No, I don't.
[456:11.30]Well, I always do feel like there's someone in the house because there are always people in this house.
[456:17.20]You know, there's three people here.
[456:23.88]Oh, shit.
[456:26.22]Thank you for the three dollars, though.
[456:27.36]That was a pretty good gag.
[456:28.32]That was a pretty good bit.
[456:30.04]That was a pretty good goof.
[456:37.42]Does Jex live here?
[456:38.26]Yeah.
[456:42.52]Thank you, Kimchi dude.
[456:45.42]Uh, thank you to Skelly Boner for the three dollars.
[456:51.13]Like zoinks, Scoob.
[456:52.23]Don't worry, Jerma.
[456:52.87]If you burn out your liver, you can have mine.
[456:55.19]I'm not gonna burn my liver out by drinking pineapple juice.
[456:57.43]You guys are just trying to get in my head.
[456:59.24]You guys are really good at doing that.
[457:01.50]And it's weird because it's like, oh, pineapple juice.
[457:03.14]And I'll read one just all lowercase comment.
[457:07.54]by just some, hey, you know, that causes liver damage.
[457:11.56]And they might not even have a sub or a bit badge, just a random chat member.
[457:16.23]It could be anybody.
[457:16.91]It could be somebody that's a 32 months up.
[457:19.47]It doesn't matter who it is.
[457:21.29]Hey, dude, that's like really not good for you.
[457:26.77]3,000 people made your stomach ache from thousands of miles away.
[457:41.90]Here's the fucking hilarious part about that, right?
[457:46.95]I could have just said, I don't want a fucking Mountain Dew and put it downstairs.
[457:56.46]I could have just said, no, I'm not drinking the Mountain Dew and just went back to the game.
[458:06.33]Dude, I get so... But I didn't.
[458:08.79]I know!
[458:11.65]We have the power over you.
[458:22.12]In your head, the stakes were higher than they actually were.
[458:25.12]Yeah.
[458:27.18]When I pull back and look at this objectively here, there are no stakes.
[458:32.16]I was putting such huge stakes on an old retro Mountain Dew.
[458:39.05]I didn't need to be there.
[458:39.99]Am I going to play Mordhau again?
[458:44.25]Probably, yeah.
[458:50.06]Maybe I'll do that on Sunday.
[458:53.08]Because if I have one episode left and then season two and then maybe an episode... I don't know.
[458:58.18]Maybe I'll throw it in on Sunday after Sam & Max.
[459:03.14]Maybe if I spend like three, four hours on the first couple episodes or something.
[459:06.96]We'll see.
[459:07.28]I'm up for anything.
[459:14.83]Hey, Internet Jorge, thanks for the $5.
[459:16.17]I quit smoking cigarettes a few years ago, but Jerma, you inspired me to buy a pack.
[459:20.79]I hope that is not true.
[459:23.61]I went over many reasons why I don't smoke cigarettes.
[459:26.65]I hope that's not true.
[459:28.23]Thanks for the $5.
[459:28.79]I hope you do not start smoking again.
[459:31.71]Don't do that.
[459:33.25]You went so long.
[459:35.35]It's been three years.
[459:37.07]You don't start now.
[459:40.21]But thank you for the $5.
[459:42.93]Tar Alakrin, thanks for the $3.
[459:45.22]Jerma's a raging smoker.
[459:46.54]Don't listen to his denials.
[459:48.58]He's even got an emote of a man holding a lit cigar in his hand.
[459:52.71]jermaJex, jermaJex 2.
[459:53.79]That's not a cigar.
[460:03.35]It's a smoking finger gun.
[460:13.72]Thanks, Jerome, for the crack addiction.
[460:15.48]Death does kind of concern me a little bit.
[460:23.12]Have I ever said anything that somebody may have taken and... Like, oh, I'm going to do that.
[460:30.48]And they do it?
[460:31.86]They listen to me or something?
[460:33.24]Sometimes I think about that.
[460:37.05]Like, have I ever influenced somebody to do something stupid?
[460:40.65]I hope not.
[460:41.85]Hopefully we have a positive.
[460:43.67]No, it was a joke.
[460:44.25]I know, I know, I know it was a joke.
[460:47.14]I'm just saying, like, in the ten years I've been doing this, have I ever said anything dumb that somebody was like, oh, I'm gonna do that now.
[460:57.99]You influenced me to sub, and that's pretty stupid.
[461:13.95]You made me and my friend repeat your old TF2 video jokes at school and we got made fun of.
[461:20.75]God damn it.
[461:31.58]True same.
[461:32.58]True fucking true same.
[461:34.18]Same.
[461:39.52]By show of hands, how many people in this chat were bullied because they said the word shpee too many times?
[461:52.90]No, no, no.
[461:55.02]That was a fun, positive video.
[461:59.39]And we had a good time.
[462:00.53]I have good times.
[462:03.29]They don't know what the fuck they're talking about, alright?
[462:06.43]They just didn't get it.
[462:08.89]Don't listen to those people.
[462:24.14]My roommates thought I was crazy because I was laughing at your streams.
[462:29.96]Well, here, see guys, this is funny because...
[462:34.32]you guys watched the streams and videos and maybe showed them to somebody and made a reference to them and they were like, oh, that was stupid.
[462:41.29]You're stupid, right?
[462:42.25]Like, as a point of reference here, right?
[462:44.83]I made these videos and showed them to people and some of them stopped talking to me because of it.
[462:54.86]Remember that time I told you the story about that girl that I showed Otto's Big Adventure to and she literally just did not really want to talk to me ever again?
[463:04.52]Happened to me, in real life.
[463:08.77]You guys remember that story?
[463:09.59]I told that one a long time ago.
[463:18.92]I was so embarrassed, because how do you explain to anybody?
[463:23.54]It's just, okay, so I had family come over.
[463:26.13]this past week when I was gone.
[463:27.91]As you know, I was gone for like a week and a few days.
[463:32.57]And trying to... One of my family members loaded up the New Year's Eve worst of the year stream.
[463:40.99]Just it was the first thing that they happened to click on.
[463:42.45]They were like, oh, this is your channel.
[463:43.71]I'm like, yeah, yeah, it's my channel.
[463:46.26]Oh, and they watched it.
[463:47.98]And it got to worst beater.
[463:51.26]And I was just... How would I ever explain what this was?
[463:57.28]He's looking over his shoulder like, Peter, what is that?
[464:01.10]Peter?
[464:01.36]And I'm like, ah, it's kind of an inhumor thing.
[464:05.54]It's hard to explain.
[464:08.28]The next one that comes up, best impression and worst impression was about me doing the 2013 YouTuber.
[464:16.19]He just had no fucking idea what I was talking about.
[464:23.54]Like, Bugleberry, like, I could not describe this to my family.
[464:27.69]Remember I told you, online media?
[464:31.27]Because it's much easier just to be like, oh yeah, I work, I'm like a PR guy.
[464:37.05]I actually think I've used that before to like a random family member.
[464:41.26]Oh yeah, I work in PR.
[464:42.58]That's a complete lie.
[464:46.20]But, hey, I work in PR in media for a media company is way easier than Bugleberry reading scary stories.
[464:56.90]That makes more sense.
[465:08.14]Just say influencer, even that, no, I don't like that word.
[465:13.82]Online entertainer comedian.
[465:16.38]Yeah, but then what okay, but remember we talked about this when you start to give those details then it becomes a Comedian, where do you perform?
[465:25.41]A Website what's the website?
[465:28.29]Well, I The website is a as a website a lot of the streaming website and
[465:43.78]what's this what is it what's it called what am I going to be like I'm not telling you I'm not going to tell you what the website's called they would think I was doing porn you work you do videos comedy video online but you won't tell me the website what are you ashamed of say you work for Amazon what department
[466:09.17]Boxing.
[466:09.95]Boxes.
[466:11.33]Oh, I thought you said you were a comedian.
[466:13.73]Yeah, I tell jokes to the boxes in the storage room.
[466:21.67]It's just a very difficult thing to describe.
[466:36.06]Are you ashamed of the job?
[466:37.22]No, I'm not ashamed of this job.
[466:38.84]I love this job.
[466:39.99]And I don't even like to use the word job, because job implies that it's... I gotta go to work today.
[466:49.59]We've talked about me not using the term job here.
[466:54.04]Because once it becomes a job, it gets in your head, and it's my job, and it's my... I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta do it, it's my job!
[467:05.53]No, I'm an unemployed self-reliant Amazon box comedian warehouse employee, okay?
[467:15.36]That's my title.
[467:16.74]That's what I am.
[467:17.92]I'm not an influencer.
[467:20.24]I'm not a streamer.
[467:32.53]Social media comedian?
[467:33.79]Yeah, I know, but explaining that to somebody that has never even heard of any of this.
[467:39.54]But.
[467:40.98]That's what it is.
[467:41.76]Are we the boxes?
[467:42.82]No, no, that's just my- no.
[467:47.08]Just say you're a receiver of donations.
[467:59.77]What do you do for work?
[468:01.09]I'm a receiver of donations.
[468:04.18]Doesn't that- that's like a... That's panhandling.
[468:11.58]You'll be able to find me, uh, usually outside of a gas station?
[468:16.56]What?
[468:27.14]My job is people give me money.
[468:35.19]Streaming is just internet panhandling.
[468:38.93]No, but that's not true either.
[468:40.91]At least, hold on a second.
[468:43.21]At least give me like a shred of credit.
[468:46.40]Even like a tiny bit of credit.
[468:51.40]You could think that.
[468:52.24]That's fine.
[468:52.78]But like, can I just get even like 10% of credit here?
[469:07.06]Streaming is like being a televangelist.
[469:11.48]I mean, okay, at its very, very core, streaming is just televangelism.
[469:18.64]Kind of.
[469:19.94]But no, I guess it's like the guy's on stage, smiling, he's just telling stories with a room full of people that are all going to give him money.
[469:29.74]Fuck, I really am a televangelist.
[469:31.60]But I'm having this really hard realization here.
[469:36.31]I'm not taking advantage of anybody.
[469:40.16]I run a TV channel.
[469:41.24]Thank you.
[469:41.90]That's right.
[469:48.90]You're the equivalent of those guys on the street who paint themselves gold and do the robot dance.
[469:56.24]No, no, that's not... That is not what's happening here.
[470:08.75]Yes, it is.
[470:09.67]No, it is not.
[470:13.01]I am not the guy from the Muro Trip.
[470:22.26]That's... Oh, fuck, I am doing that.
[470:24.78]I do that all the time.
[470:40.95]That's literally what it is.
[470:45.17]Televangelist Gold Robot.
[470:58.26]That's so fucking ridiculous.
[471:06.57]Oh my god, that's too funny.
[471:10.18]It's alright, though.
[471:16.13]You're digging yourself deeper, I know.
[471:19.51]But that's fucking pretty funny.
[471:28.10]Alright, let's keep going.
[471:31.60]We had two, three $50 donations come in, and a $100 donation came in.
[471:39.27]I keep thinking about the robot dancing.
[471:41.47]I'm gonna be, my eyes are gonna be plastered onto the ceiling tonight, going like, fuck, am I really that robot guy that, like, dances on the sidewalk?
[472:03.61]Anyways, thank you to Spoons for self-defense, Colonel Zero, Basic Feral for $50, and then Velimi for $100.
[472:17.66]Thank you.
[472:21.96]I had to tell my girlfriend I was listening to an actual comedian while working.
[472:25.54]She doesn't understand Twitch.
[472:27.70]Yeah, I'm an online comedian.
[472:28.94]That's fine.
[472:30.32]Online...
[472:31.82]Gold-painted robot sidewalk comedian.
[472:34.41]I'm fine with that.
[472:36.51]As long as comedian's in there somewhere and online media.
[472:45.47]Uh, but pretty support thanks to the $15.
[472:48.53]Jeremy, drink the nectar.
[472:56.64]Drink the nectar.
[473:00.10]I don't know what that means.
[473:04.04]What was I doing a few hours ago?
[473:11.27]But thank you for the $15.
[473:12.13]Oh, Mountain Dew.
[473:13.15]That's what it was.
[473:13.77]Mountain Dew.
[473:15.83]Mr. Potato Daddy.
[473:17.15]Thanks for the $5.
[473:18.09]Chug it.
[473:19.37]No.
[473:19.99]This was during... I remember this part.
[473:21.30]Mm-mm.
[473:25.36]Thank you, Ramblin' Jan, for the $10.
[473:27.30]10 bucks from Ramblin' Jan.
[473:31.50]Chug a cup of water and say your new catchphrase.
[473:33.80]There's no way I'm drinking the Mountain Dew.
[473:36.82]Well, I did you one more.
[473:38.17]I put water in the Mountain Dew and then turned the can upside down to prove that it was empty and water came out and it ruined my plan.
[473:46.79]That's the long and short of that one.
[473:55.95]But thank you for the $10.
[473:56.81]Thank you also for $10 from FlarePancake.
[474:00.93]Thank you, FlarePancake, for the $10.
[474:02.19]Hey, Jerm, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to catch any streams for a while.
[474:06.25]Leaving to visit family in the Philippines for a month later this week.
[474:10.52]Very much looking forward to catching the VODs when I return.
[474:13.92]Jermahart.
[474:15.90]Have a safe trip.
[474:18.20]Thanks for the $10.
[474:18.74]Hope you and your family have a good time in the Philippines.
[474:28.53]We look forward to your return.
[474:31.87]There'll be plenty of VODs when you get back.
[474:34.29]Thank you.
[474:37.84]You're the leader of an online comedy cult.
[474:48.84]That's fine.
[474:49.98]I'm okay with that.
[474:52.38]E-clown.
[474:54.98]I'm not even opposed to that.
[475:00.55]E-Clown, I would, honestly, E-Clown is better than Influencer.
[475:13.38]E-Clown.
[475:16.04]This is not functional enough to be called a cult.
[475:19.47]No, not really.
[475:27.17]Hey, Todd Flower, thanks for the 250.
[475:29.45]Real chug or real riot?
[475:31.27]I did a real chug.
[475:32.09]It just wasn't Mountain Dew.
[475:35.09]JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[475:36.71]Thanks for the 250.
[475:37.83]Jerma lies again.
[475:40.34]Feels bad, man.
[475:46.96]Lied again.
[475:49.36]There'll be more usernames tomorrow.
[475:58.62]Thank you, though.

[476:06.94]Thanks for the 12 bucks.
[476:08.54]Dermalied about Mountain Dew throwback.
[476:11.18]Somebody... I mean, it's available.
[476:12.84]It's definitely available.
[476:14.01]Why would anyone have that username?
[476:16.23]If that username was taken, it would be a shock.
[476:20.65]One of you time-traveled.
[476:30.22]But thank you.
[476:31.30]Really appreciate it.
[476:33.88]Pika Banana, thanks for 10 bucks.
[476:36.10]It's always so nice to sit down and catch the tail end of a Jerma stream after a long day.
[476:42.28]Happy to have you.
[476:42.78]Thank you.
[476:43.28]Yeah.

[476:57.47]And then we just relaxed and enjoyed.

[479:59.00]We have a couple more bits to go through
[480:02.60]Uh, Pin!
[480:03.16]Thanks, Pin, for the 250.
[480:05.18]What's going on, Pin?
[480:05.89]Hey, Jerma, just a bit of an update.
[480:07.07]I've been without my, uh, V-vance, V-vance, for the last few weeks.
[480:13.67]Because of my heart condition, it's been okay.
[480:16.96]I'm actually growing in appreciation for my old self, but I really do miss being able to think without being distracted and cloudy all the time.
[480:25.29]I was surprised when you said you had a similar experience, and I'm really happy that I could share my struggles with the community.
[480:30.83]Thanks again, and fuck you.
[480:39.43]That's how you end that one?
[480:40.41]Well, thanks.
[480:44.76]But, yes.
[480:46.40]I've... ADHD has been a struggle.
[480:53.54]Uh, for me.
[480:54.90]And I remember taking medication that fucked with me.
[481:03.11]So I know, I kind of know what it's like.
[481:06.85]To have, uh... You know.
[481:11.23]Your brain and body fight back.
[481:13.83]The colitis thing, too.
[481:19.01]I am no stranger to medical issues and you know different stuff like that so I really really hope that you can um stay managed get managed right human parties suck yeah but you know you just kind of you just have to keep doing what you can
[481:48.72]you just go you do what you can you try new things try taking some medications get off of them follow some you know your doctor's orders take care of yourself everybody's doing something you know everybody's got something and once you once you realize that everybody where everyone's like the same everyone's the same
[482:14.42]Everybody has, like, issues and problems that they deal with, and once you know that, you can relate and you can start to understand.
[482:28.31]No, I'm perfect.
[482:29.31]Well, that's- I'm glad you are.
[482:34.33]But once you get older, you start to get a little bit more knowledge.
[482:38.96]You start to understand what works for you and what doesn't.
[482:43.30]And you only find that out by trying to keep your issues under control.
[482:52.25]Are people laughing when I said that you get older and you get more knowledge?
[482:58.07]People who think they have this shit together just don't realize what's broken yet.
[483:04.44]Yeah, nobody's perfect.
[483:08.70]Everybody has something they do great and something they don't do so great.
[483:11.85]Everybody has something that's potentially going on in their life, and... We're all in this together, guys.
[483:19.03]We're all human beings.
[483:25.60]But thank you, Pin.
[483:27.76]I wish you the best.
[483:38.25]Otto is perfect.
[483:43.41]Well, Otto's a dog.
[483:45.91]Dogs are all perfect.
[483:48.27]By default.
[483:50.51]But hey, Mitchell, thanks for the $15, Mitchell.
[483:52.79]You influenced me to reach into the toilet and... Eat.
[483:59.62]Uh, I'm not, no.
[484:01.14]Good times.
[484:01.68]Thank you for the $15, Mitchell.
[484:03.66]I am not going to read that one out loud.
[484:10.88]Did I say that?
[484:20.63]I did say that.
[484:26.39]No, did I?
[484:27.33]Did I actually say those exact words?
[484:29.35]Hold on.
[484:38.75]Holy fuck.
[484:39.05]I've said too many things.
[484:39.97]Remember I told you about the ti- Guys, listen.
[484:42.43]We have...
[485:05.50]We have thousands of hours of video footage of me speaking.
[485:12.87]There are like 3,000 videos that I've been a part of.
[485:17.69]I've been on stream, I've said like, I've probably said two to three million words.
[485:32.55]Never, oh yeah, this cigarettes thing.
[485:34.87]I said a lot of fucked up stuff back in like 2014 YouTube days.
[485:39.05]Imagine running for president.
[485:46.10]Don't worry.
[485:46.56]Remember the piss into my own face line?
[485:56.32]Vaguely.
[486:05.12]Oh, the shit that I say.
[486:08.90]He used to record me saying such fucking outrageous shit.
[486:12.80]I remember actually talking to him before being like, hey man, did I like, you're not going to use like that of me saying that, right?
[486:18.89]And he was like, yeah, I am.
[486:21.93]I'm like, no, you can't, can you like not do that?
[486:24.91]Because it does like a couple of times.
[486:26.11]Like, could you just like not remove like a couple of them?
[486:29.54]I remember bargaining with him.
[486:34.53]While he was editing those videos.
[486:37.33]He would show them to me half complete and stuff.
[486:39.53]Star and I used to watch each other's videos all the time.
[486:42.95]Before anybody else did.
[486:44.81]We'd be sitting at a call and we'd have, you know, a video that was 60-70% complete.
[486:49.53]And we would just watch them and be like, give feedback.
[486:51.87]Did you think that was funny?
[486:53.61]Did you not like that?
[486:54.83]This part was kind of boring.
[486:55.63]You should probably trim that down.
[486:56.67]We used to do it all the time.
[486:58.97]I would do it for him and he would do it for me.
[487:01.59]And there was so many of those cases where it was like, he would show me a clip like that, or he'd show me like a string of clips and I'd be like, oh, okay.
[487:12.86]How many times did I say like, fuck you in that video?
[487:15.30]Like maybe take like three or four of like the motherfuckers and fuck you.
[487:19.75]Because remember, this is also at that turning point.
[487:22.78]I used to be a channel that did not swear.
[487:25.66]I was a PG channel back from 2010 to 2012.
[487:29.34]I was a super PG.
[487:35.30]No swears, no... I tried to keep it as family friendly as I could.
[487:41.29]And once I crossed... That essentially was the crossover.
[487:44.87]Me saying I was going to eat shit out of the toilet was the ultimate crossover.
[487:48.49]Because how are you ever going to go back?
[487:51.63]Hey guys, welcome to Jerma985.
[487:53.89]We're gonna be playing Minecraft.
[487:56.11]Oh crap, I just dropped my shovel.
[487:58.41]Oh, oh doo-doo.
[487:59.86]I literally just talked about pissing into my own face on somebody else's video.
[488:05.10]Those videos that he made were sort of like the entryway for me to be like, alright, well, fucking whatever, who cares?
[488:12.26]I'm not gonna do that anymore.
[488:19.68]I miss family-friendly Jerma.
[488:27.05]Imagine watching Sesame Street and then after years of being kid-friendly, Big Bird just starts yelling about putting cigarettes out on his dick.
[488:40.61]Oh my god.
[488:46.93]I wasn't kid-friendly, though.
[488:49.52]I was... I just didn't use any vulgarities, right?
[488:54.82]I wasn't, like, a child family... Like, I wasn't a family video maker.
[489:01.26]I played, like, M-rated games, I talked about, like, kind of screwed up stuff, but I didn't ever... Subscriber-friendly.
[489:14.09]I'm gonna go watch it back and watch those videos.
[489:16.14]It's probably the first 50 to 100 videos I made.
[489:20.44]No, no, no, that's not even true.
[489:21.78]No, no, no, that's not true.
[489:23.70]The first... The first like 20 videos I made, I didn't give a shit and said anything.
[489:29.93]Because I didn't think anyone was gonna watch my videos.
[489:33.73]So there's this weird period where the first 20 to 30 videos on Jerma985 are...
[489:40.86]Just no filter.
[489:42.72]I'm saying just wicked stupid shit and like swearing and don't give a fuck.
[489:46.10]Right?
[489:47.60]And once I realized that people were watching and I started to get an audience, it was like, wait a minute.
[489:53.34]I kind of, who is, I got, I kind of probably have to clean my act up a little bit.
[489:58.57]I can't tell people to like to fuck off in the game and stuff.
[490:01.15]No, no, no.
[490:01.67]Alright, I'm going to like clean it up a little bit.
[490:04.11]And then from like video number 40 to video number like 150,
[490:10.28]was clean cut pg Jeremy and then the floodgates opened and here we are did you delete and unlist these videos no they're all still there no they're they're they're all there
[490:43.43]I feel like you were still vulgar in 2012.
[490:45.37]Well, because remember, 2011 was when I was really starting to do it.
[490:52.54]For real.
[490:53.62]I made a lot of videos in 2011 into 2012.
[490:55.96]There had to have been at least 50 to 100 videos.
[491:04.30]I remember all... Okay, here's a good indicator.
[491:07.32]My entire Super Meat Boy playthrough...
[491:10.43]If you didn't know that, I have a full Super Meat Boy playthrough.
[491:15.76]On my channel.
[491:16.86]The whole thing.
[491:19.86]I was making sure I didn't swear during that whole thing.
[491:24.04]So when was that?
[491:24.78]2011?
[491:25.80]2012?
[491:25.92]Never finished the Dark World.
[491:32.59]No, I didn't.
[491:33.09]Not on camera.
[491:38.11]You gotta watch them now.
[491:39.75]I think I actually maybe say one or two squares.
[491:42.37]But they're like, ah, shit!
[491:43.91]Oh!
[491:44.09]And I correct myself.
[491:45.29]Ooh!
[491:50.59]It's weird.
[491:52.71]I've been around for a long time.
[491:53.63]2020, or I believe 2020 in June, right, will be my 10-year anniversary of
[492:09.93]sidewalk painted gold robot dancing Amazon cardboard box comedian that's 10 years I can't I sometimes can't believe it what's the plan I'm gonna do a fake retirement party
[492:41.72]And I'm going to hire a bunch of old people actors.
[492:43.67]And I'm going to do it in a retirement home.
[492:49.27]That's true.
[492:59.09]Fake.
[493:00.67]Yeah, no, that's what I want to do.
[493:02.65]I want to get a bunch of older, elderly actors to be on camera and we're going to do a retirement party.
[493:14.47]But, where did we leave off here?
[493:18.17]We only have like two more.
[493:20.57]We had $5 from PikaBanana.
[493:21.99]Thank you, PikaBanana.
[493:24.45]You've done so much for us.
[493:25.44]It's crazy that some people think what you do is weird.
[493:27.94]You absolutely are awesome.
[493:29.86]It's from a heart.
[493:32.56]Thank you so much for saying that.
[493:36.16]But, it's not that what is weird.
[493:41.00]It's just hard to explain to people that don't know what it is.
[493:46.06]So you run a radio show?
[493:47.20]No.
[493:48.29]You play games.
[493:49.61]For what?
[493:50.35]For people to watch?
[493:52.51]But sometimes I don't play games.
[493:53.61]Sometimes I just hang out and do something else.
[493:54.93]Sometimes I do like a project.
[493:56.85]What do you mean?
[493:57.73]I built a birdhouse.
[493:59.03]Why?
[494:00.29]Who watched you build a birdhouse?
[494:02.85]I can't explain it.
[494:03.65]You don't get it?
[494:04.35]It's okay.
[494:05.01]But it's hard to explain.
[494:06.69]There's no way.
[494:10.09]It was a game or a birdhouse.
[494:10.95]It was.
[494:13.31]But thanks to the five dolls, Peakbanana, and thanks for the incredibly kind message.
[494:17.61]And finally, to take us out here, uh, eight and a half, eight hours and fifteen minutes.
[494:22.47]It's a long one.
[494:24.17]Graveyard Ghoul, thanks for the five dolls.
[494:27.78]All this talk about you being an online comedian, when are you actually going to do the stand-up stream?
[494:34.32]Let me get, let me get through the dunk tank stream first.
[494:38.23]That's the next thing coming up.
[494:39.73]And then we can talk.
[494:40.45]I really want to get this out of the way because it's something I want to do.
[494:42.63]It sounds like a ton of fun.
[494:46.15]It's not going to be that much time.
[494:48.55]It will be a lot of work, but it won't be that much time to put together.
[494:52.80]It'll be like two or three straight days of a ton of work.
[494:56.00]Of like all day.
[494:58.38]But I think it's going to be great.
[495:01.98]And right at the very end, all Mew4.
[495:04.75]Thanks for the $3.00.
[495:07.32]Just something before the stream ends.
[495:08.38]Love making the streams when I can.
[495:12.58]Happy to have you.
[495:14.74]Whenever you can come and hang out, we're always happy to see new and familiar faces.
[495:22.28]So, thank you, everybody.
[495:27.22]So, I will see you guys on Saturday.
