[00:01.74]Well, this is not good.
[00:08.81]Currently 33% drop frames.
[00:13.83]This is not what I'm looking for here.
[00:26.10]Let's give it a second.
[00:31.31]Spell iCup.
[00:32.55]I stare at you while you build something.
[00:50.05]I don't know.
[00:51.05]Oh my god, 35% of every frame is dropped?
[00:52.93]What the fuck, man?
[00:55.80]You know what?
[00:56.16]It's mad that I'm leaving.
[00:59.90]It's upset that I'm leaving.
[01:01.24]Oh, this is not cool.
[01:02.32]Hold on.
[01:08.57]This sucks because literally in two days, literally, literally, literally,
[01:16.70]On Wednesday, all of my stuff leaves.
[01:20.59]I'm gonna be, like, empty.
[01:22.47]I'm gonna have nothing in two days.
[01:24.85]My computer's going.
[01:26.21]I'm gonna... All my shit's going.
[01:27.65]I'm gonna be streaming from a toaster on Wednesday.
[01:30.05]You understand?
[01:39.10]One last Comcast rant.
[01:41.36]And this is it.
[01:41.94]I didn't even make a tweet yet.
[01:43.16]I'm not even sure I should.
[01:46.78]Catch you.
[01:49.14]Hold on, let me, just give me a second.
[01:50.48]Let me go put on like a shirt so we can at least talk.
[01:52.96]Hold on.
[01:57.23]One last time, right?
[01:58.45]One last time before I go.
[01:59.91]Make sure you fuck it up, Comcast.
[02:01.76]One last time.
[02:02.78]I'll be right back.
[03:22.78]Well, let's turn this down here.
[03:25.64]I might as well just hang out for a little bit.
[03:27.54]I'm not going to even tweet this until this is... This shirt is on, right?
[03:31.01]Okay, yeah, I'm good.
[03:35.73]Like, I'm always so paranoid that there's going to be no... I'm going to have no, like, pants on.
[03:40.75]And I just... I checked, like, five times.
[03:43.99]Yeah, I'm wearing, like, a button-up, alright?
[03:45.83]That's all I... That's the only thing that was... I just got home from a wedding.
[03:49.01]No, that's not true.
[03:50.14]Hold on.
[04:08.14]Yeah, guys, you know, this is what I look like when I wear work clothes.
[04:11.38]A nice shirt.
[04:12.16]You know what I'm saying?
[04:13.74]Let's make sure we get this up there so you can take a look and see.
[04:19.25]No, that's not right.
[04:19.93]Hold on.
[04:22.71]There we go.
[04:24.55]Yeah, see?
[04:25.69]I mean, I've got my button up here.
[04:29.59]My hair was styled.
[04:31.81]And like all business casual, I have on my Star Wars pajamas.
[04:51.49]Going to a frat party?
[04:53.03]This is, no, look, there was a tie here.
[04:57.18]Straight down here.
[04:57.88]I don't wear undershirts.
[04:59.80]They make me sweat.
[05:02.52]You have no idea.
[05:03.76]Here's a pro tip for you guys.
[05:05.16]All you guys that have perspiration problems, and the ladies too, this goes both ways here.
[05:10.01]If you have perspiration problems, don't you wear an extra shirt?
[05:15.59]I got to wear an extra shirt to make sure I'm sweating.
[05:18.07]I got to absorb it.
[05:19.25]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[05:20.73]Get rid of your goddamn arm hair and don't wear an undershirt.
[05:25.87]You will still stop and stop slathering like up and down with that fucking stick of deodorant.
[05:31.95]You're just making it so much worse.
[05:33.05]I used to do the same thing.
[05:40.36]Yeah, this is just not.
[05:44.08]You got to fuck with me one more time before I leave.
[05:46.09]And this is the thing I was going to bring up today.
[05:49.01]Let me look like fucking cool.
[05:50.37]Hold on a minute.
[05:56.49]That's better.
[05:57.69]Hold on, let's do the whole, I gotta make sure this is right.
[06:08.14]This is not gonna hurt.
[06:12.34]I can't do this button.
[06:19.13]I'm gonna fucking, this is a nice shirt.
[06:20.59]I don't wanna fuck this up.

[09:31.22]I'll read off the back of a fucking menu.
[09:45.92]That's okay.
[09:52.32]I need to, what should I read?
[09:53.30]Um, general church reading.
[10:03.60]Uh, how about, uh, read Fifty Shades of Gray.
[10:15.75]I gotta change the tone in here though, hold on.
[10:33.67]It's way too bright.
[10:48.88]No, that looks like shit.
[10:51.42]That's OK.
[10:51.86]Hold on.
[10:57.91]Let's get a filter on here.
[10:59.11]I don't know what this is going to do.
[11:08.65]No, that's OK.
[11:11.24]Leave it bright.
[11:12.10]It's going to get brighter as we go.
[11:14.06]The more that we communicate, right?
[11:16.08]Okay.
[11:16.30]How about just a, what's like a, what's like a reading?
[11:21.15]Here we go.
[11:26.41]How about this?
[11:31.19]Wedding ceremony readings.
[11:33.56]Blessing of the hands.
[11:34.90]What is love?
[11:35.72]Is that like the baby don't hurt me or what?
[11:39.55]Okay, how about instructions for life in the new millennium?
[11:46.80]This is just like a poem.
[11:50.38]Okay, so now we gotta get the text on the screen.
[11:56.70]And I need my book.
[11:57.90]I got my Steam book.
[12:00.28]In here is all you need to know.
[12:02.02]Oh right, the Lord Gaben, right?
[12:04.86]Should I bring up that?
[12:05.58]Should I make a joke about that?
[12:07.96]Should I teleport myself like four years?
[12:16.87]Here we go.
[12:21.49]Here we go.
[12:21.89]There it is.
[12:23.96]This is from the excerpt from The Bridge Across Forever.
[12:33.80]I need to have the music ready.
[12:37.08]Let's get the text on the screen.
[12:48.79]Is this what they say?
[12:51.15]When you go to church, is there like a sign that says this?
[12:54.13]Like when you walk in the front door?
[12:59.36]Probably.
[13:05.48]This is fine.
[13:10.46]None of these are like... This is fine.
[13:12.60]Okay.
[13:13.88]Alright, let's go.
[13:15.14]Let me do the embarrassing thing that I'm going to do.
[13:16.70]If I even still have it here.
[13:19.70]Where did it go?
[13:22.60]If you're curious, Comcast has decided to fuck up the stream once again.
[13:25.43]So, play the game.
[13:27.53]I wish I could.
[13:28.71]I wish I could.
[13:29.17]I've dropped 11,000 frames.
[13:31.91]So, we're doing this for about another five minutes.
[13:38.87]It's fixed.
[13:40.97]Wait, it's fixed?
[13:43.90]It's working?
[13:46.60]Why does it still say I'm dropping frames here?
[13:54.94]That doesn't belong in my church.
[13:56.58]Okay, here we go.
[13:57.06]These hands of your partner, young and...
[14:25.37]I'm not doing it.
[14:26.04]It didn't feel right to me.
[14:26.96]You know what I mean?
[14:28.86]That didn't feel right at all.
[14:30.26]That felt like I was not having any fun there.
[14:33.24]Hey, welcome to Skyrim.
[14:35.98]Right?
[14:38.12]Hey, can I interest you in some Skyrim?
[14:39.54]No, what's it?
[14:40.42]Oblivion.
[14:42.51]There we go.
[14:44.47]If this turns the fuck off in like 10 minutes, I swear to God, I'm going to be so angry.
[14:49.63]Alright, here it comes.
[14:51.21]Get my dumb ass off the screen.
[14:57.13]And away.
[14:57.89]It's going to be loud.
[14:58.57]It's going to be really loud, and I'm sorry about that.
[15:02.45]There's nothing I can do about it.
[15:03.69]But thank the Lord, right?
[15:05.51]You see, that's all we had to do.
[15:07.57]We just had to pray.
[15:08.55]I just did a sermon.
[15:10.59]I put on a button-up shirt, and I said the word God, and now all of a sudden we can play.
[15:15.06]You understand?
[15:15.50]This is all calculated.
[15:16.42]This is all.
[15:16.98]I calculated this, and I knew this.
[15:22.50]Alright.
[15:23.34]Let's go.
[15:27.46]Watch your ears.
[15:31.30]Come on, show up on the screen.
[15:33.08]Come on.
[15:36.95]Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[15:38.23]No, here it comes.
[15:42.39]Here comes Jack Sparrow.
[15:44.53]And those bandits.
[15:47.45]No, no, wait, wait, wait.
[15:59.67]It's a little too loud, don't you think?
[16:07.77]I didn't even get a chance to tell you about my day.
[16:09.41]It was very stressful.
[16:13.48]I think we're good.
[16:15.10]Make the music louder.
[16:16.14]I don't want to do that.
[16:17.92]Let me just take off this fucking shirt.
[16:19.44]Hold on.
[16:20.66]Wait, my facecam's not on, right?
[16:26.38]No one has ever escaped from the imperial prison in over 40... I didn't get to read that.
[16:31.88]I was born 87 years ago.
[16:34.22]Is that Patrick Stewart?
[16:36.27]For 65 years, I've ruled as Tamriel's emperor.
[16:39.73]It is.
[16:40.69]But for all these years, I've never been the ruler of my own dreams.
[16:47.01]He's everywhere, man.
[16:48.01]I have seen the gates of oblivion, beyond which no waking eye may see.
[16:54.92]Behold, in darkness, a doom sweeps the land.
[16:58.70]So loud.
[16:59.08]I can't change it either.
[17:00.44]I'm sorry.
[17:04.58]Just turn the volume down.
[17:05.70]I'll see you in a minute.
[17:11.72]Everyone says louder, and it is louder, and I can't even fix it.
[17:17.08]This is the 27th of Last Seed, the year of Akatosh 433.
[17:22.03]Why am I bleeding?
[17:24.54]These are the closing days of the third era.
[17:27.32]I'm taking blood on this shirt.
[17:28.98]It was like $150.
[17:31.42]Of my life.
[17:32.59]I better not have gotten blood on this shirt.
[17:34.09]It was $145.
[17:34.27]God damn it.
[17:35.07]You can't get blood out of a shirt.
[17:41.88]There's no way.
[17:42.78]It doesn't happen.
[17:43.86]Good luck.
[17:53.49]Okay, you saw me turn it down.
[17:56.73]I didn't do this.
[18:03.62]I didn't even do this shit.
[18:22.85]Okay, there we go.
[18:23.95]Let's wake up.
[18:24.85]Now we get to make our character.
[18:26.01]Okay, let's enter character name.
[18:35.90]I'm not a Mormon.
[18:36.94]That's like a shitty joke from before.
[18:38.44]How about, uh... How about, uh... Hold on.
[18:47.48]I can't even have the name until I see what I have.
[18:50.45]Race, Imperial...
[18:54.44]Okay, here we go.
[18:55.08]Imperial.
[18:56.38]Natives of the civilized cosmopolitan province of Cyrodiil.
[18:59.76]They have proved to be shrewd.
[19:03.24]Okay, done.
[19:05.52]Cat person.
[19:06.46]I don't want to be a regular person.
[19:11.23]Orc.
[19:12.91]Redguard.
[19:13.63]Wood elf.
[19:15.07]Redguard.
[19:15.89]Orc.
[19:24.18]Alright, well, it's either the dinosaur or... I mean, I think it has to be the dinosaur.
[19:31.14]This reptilian race, well-suited for the treacherous swamps of their homeland, has developed natural immunities to diseases and poisons.
[19:37.50]They can breathe water and are good at picking locks.
[19:42.16]Yeah, I think we're going to have to be dinosaur.
[19:47.35]Now I know it's a dinosaur, so... Face.
[19:51.09]Shape.
[19:55.37]Well, we don't have any mods, but you bet your ass that eventually here I will make a bunch of mutants.
[20:08.48]Alright, that looks good so far.
[20:10.86]Brow.
[20:16.76]He looks like a child's painting.
[20:18.38]Okay.
[20:19.18]Cheeks.
[20:29.96]Okay.
[20:32.22]Chin.
[20:32.56]Forward, backwards.
[20:35.36]Recess now.
[20:36.20]Bigger.
[20:38.16]Hey, the chin and the mouth are the same thing.
[20:39.85]Oh, man.
[20:40.33]Alright.
[20:48.85]Tall.
[20:50.57]Hold on.
[20:51.01]That kind of looks like a cat now.
[20:57.72]That's fine.
[20:59.10]Eyes.
[20:59.64]Eyes up and eyes down.
[21:02.92]Eyes small, eyes large.
[21:04.14]Why is it moving his cheeks?
[21:10.89]That looks good.
[21:12.81]Forehead.
[21:13.19]It makes him look sad like that.
[21:16.77]I like that.
[21:21.82]Sad and shy.
[21:22.56]Jaw.
[21:25.34]Jaw.
[21:29.65]No, it needs to be sad.
[21:30.89]Okay.
[21:37.59]He's sounding like a rabbit.
[21:40.05]He's just a bunny.
[21:41.17]Alright, I kind of like him being a bunny instead.
[21:53.15]He looks a little more rabbit-esque now.
[21:55.67]We have to add rabbit ears too.
[21:58.49]There we go.
[22:06.21]Jaw, mouth, nose.
[22:09.51]It's important.
[22:11.52]No, it's got to stay down like that for the bunny.
[22:16.50]Right there looks alright.
[22:19.84]Keep it up there.
[22:20.72]Alright, looks good.
[22:29.75]Mouth, nose.
[22:30.95]Alright.
[22:33.39]Now we go to tone.
[22:36.86]Oh, we need to make him a rabbit, so... Oh my god!
[22:43.16]Why does he have lips here?
[22:44.58]He just looks like a hologram.
[22:58.63]I don't even need the mods.
[23:07.83]Alright.
[23:09.59]Beard.
[23:13.23]No beard.
[23:20.04]Make it a little bit lighter.
[23:23.64]Eyes.
[23:23.86]That looks good.
[23:30.53]Eyelids.
[23:31.73]We don't want it to be that dark.
[23:35.21]Eyebrows.
[23:45.27]Don't know I like actually I kind of like that more I'm not sure I think I like this.
[23:54.70]What do you think?
[23:59.26]Mm-hmm.
[23:59.60]Do you want like a Candyman or should we have big thick eyebrows?
[24:03.24]I
[24:15.90]He's always concerned about something.
[24:22.11]There, that looks good.
[24:25.57]Lips.
[24:28.79]That looks good.
[24:29.61]I'm going to make sure they show up well.
[24:37.96]Nose.
[24:38.92]Colored nose.
[24:43.28]Oh, not really.
[24:44.02]Okay.
[24:44.12]Okay.
[24:47.17]Alright.
[24:48.57]I think that's good, right?
[24:50.17]Fins.
[24:50.57]Oh, here we go.
[24:51.05]Hair.
[24:51.33]Here it is.
[24:51.61]I can't change the hair color?
[24:59.46]Oh, my God.
[25:00.10]What is he?
[25:00.72]What character is that?
[25:03.44]It's like right on the tip of my tongue.
[25:05.14]I don't know who that is.
[25:05.72]Oh, this is going to drive me crazy.
[25:20.50]Shark Tale.
[25:21.41]Is that what it is?
[25:22.31]No.
[25:26.45]Almost like a Bug's Life.
[25:29.79]Is this a character like this in a Bug's Life?
[25:32.93]Yeah, a Bug's Life, that's what it is.
[25:39.44]Monsters Inc.
[25:49.37]No, I hate that.
[25:51.79]I don't hate this.
[25:54.64]Those could be more like bunny ears to me.
[25:56.68]Yeah, those are fine.
[25:58.78]Why can't I color them?
[26:01.36]Alright.
[26:01.92]Age.
[26:03.60]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[26:04.54]Easy.
[26:04.82]Hey, hey, hey.
[26:06.30]You're screwing this all up.
[26:10.04]No, it's better.
[26:16.21]Okay, now we're fine.
[26:22.90]That's good.
[26:25.54]He's just always terrified.

[27:38.46]Flife-scream.
[27:44.02]That's just flu ice cream.
[27:45.58]You don't want to eat flu-flavored ice cream.
[27:47.44]That just tastes like fucking snot.

[28:48.74]Alright.
[28:51.68]Is there FOV?
[28:53.70]Or did I do this wrong?

[29:02.59]Bloom lighting.
[29:03.49]Anti-aliasing.
[29:04.21]Where is it?

[29:06.25]Do I have to do it in the console?
[29:07.17]Do I have to enable the developer console?
[29:09.81]Or is it just there?
[29:11.81]Well, there it is.
[29:12.71]What is it?
[29:14.63]FOV space.
[29:16.01]Desired space.
[29:21.79]There it is.
[29:22.07]Well, that was easy enough.
[29:23.85]Okay.
[29:25.89]So, let's go.

[29:49.06]You'll never get to swim again, Nargonian.
[29:52.28]But don't worry.
[29:53.65]You'll be dead soon enough.
[29:55.65]Somebody gave a lot of money.
[29:57.39]You're going to die.
[29:59.31]Hey, you hear that?
[30:00.71]The guards are coming.
[30:02.41]For you.
[30:04.53]Why is E jump?
[30:08.53]E is jump?
[30:12.79]Hold on.
[30:22.00]The messenger only said they were attacked.
[30:24.48]No, they're dead.
[30:25.98]Let me out!
[30:26.94]I know it.
[30:28.13]My job right now is to get you to safety.
[30:30.35]Who?
[30:30.73]Me?
[30:31.07]What's this prisoner doing here?
[30:32.87]This cell is supposed to be off limits.
[30:35.64]Fur is murder!
[30:36.48]Fur is murder!
[30:37.88]Fur is murder!
[30:39.92]Stand back, prisoner.
[30:41.28]We won't hesitate to kill you if you get in our way.
[30:43.37]Okay.
[30:44.03]You, prisoner, stand aside.
[30:46.29]Over by the window.
[30:47.63]Stay out of the way and you won't get hurt.
[30:50.55]Oh.
[30:50.73]Prisoner, stand away from the door.
[30:52.69]Over by the window now.
[30:53.64]I don't have any windows.
[30:54.58]You talking about that thing?
[30:55.28]That's a commode.
[30:55.88]That's a mouse goes through there.
[30:56.98]Prisoner, get over by the window now.
[31:01.20]Stay put, prisoner.
[31:02.84]Good.
[31:03.38]Let's go.
[31:03.82]We're not out of this yet.
[31:06.68]You.
[31:08.24]I've seen you.
[31:09.56]Who's talking?
[31:10.56]Let me see your face.
[31:11.44]Yeah, that's right.
[31:12.10]It's not that.
[31:12.64]You are the one from my dreams.
[31:15.46]Then the stars were right.
[31:18.28]This is the day.
[31:20.62]Gods give me strength.
[31:26.54]What's going on?
[31:27.36]Assassins attacked my sons, and I am next.
[31:31.28]My blades are leading me out of the city along a secret escape route.
[31:35.86]By chance, the entrance to that escape route leads through your cell.
[31:43.58]Well, why am I here?
[31:45.12]Perhaps the gods have placed you here so that we may meet.
[31:49.32]As for what you have done, it does not matter.
[31:52.98]That is not what you will be remembered for.
[31:57.28]I mean, you wear something like that.
[31:59.64]If you smashed that up and sprinkled it over the world, I'm fairly certain you'd... Oh, let me tweet that.
[32:06.24]Hold on a second.
[32:07.52]If you smashed that and sprinkled it across the world... I forgot to make a tweet.
[32:14.69]If you smash that and sprinkle it all over the Earth, world hunger would probably go away.
[32:19.25]That thing's probably worth like $60 million.
[32:21.21]Actually, it's probably way more than that.
[32:22.26]It's going to be like $60 trillion.
[32:24.42]How much does it solve world hunger?
[32:25.68]Like $500 trillion?
[32:27.30]$50 million.
[32:27.94]$60 million.
[32:42.27]I go my own way.
[32:42.93]What should I do?
[32:43.67]You will find your own path.
[32:46.21]Take care.
[32:47.13]There will be blood and death before the end.
[32:49.87]I gotta get this off.
[32:52.51]Let me take this shirt off.
[32:56.42]I don't want to bleed on it.
[32:58.54]No, don't give me freedom like this.
[33:01.10]I'm not gonna do anything bad.
[33:16.14]I would have been stopped a long time ago.
[33:17.80]Okay.
[33:25.48]Save game.
[33:26.71]New save.
[33:27.69]Got it.

[33:31.83]General subtitles.
[33:32.59]Got it on.
[33:33.15]We're good.
[33:33.47]So am I supposed to be over here?
[33:45.55]What the fuck is he doing?
[33:48.91]Oh.
[33:50.97]With what?
[33:56.38]Who's the bad guy?
[33:57.22]Is this a bad guy?
[34:02.52]Can I have his weapon?
[34:04.18]Alright, I took his stuff.
[34:08.94]She's dead.
[34:10.36]Sorry, sir, but we have to keep moving.
[34:13.43]I'm the bad guy.
[34:14.15]Pick up the katana.
[34:16.23]Where is it?
[34:16.57]What?
[34:16.73]What's going on with this guy?
[34:18.75]What happened?
[34:19.23]Is he dead?

[35:30.68]Click on the fist icon at the bottom of the journal to bring up the inventory tab.
[35:34.14]From there, you can equip armor and weapons by clicking on them.
[35:37.46]Easy enough.
[35:39.52]So, this is my birth... I get a birth sign?

[36:46.79]Rusty axe, gold...
[36:54.76]One hit kill.
[36:55.20]I might as well just stop playing the game.
[36:58.93]Is that guy going to come alive?
[37:02.73]Shield.
[37:05.03]Skeleton.
[37:05.89]Iron arrow.
[37:06.38]Rusty dagger.
[37:07.74]Boots.
[37:08.64]Lockpick.
[37:13.41]If you have a lockpick, you can try to pick most locks.
[37:15.58]Move the pick upward into a tumbler.
[37:18.52]When the tumbler reaches the top of the lock, click the left mouse button to secure it in its place.
[37:23.42]When all tumblers are at the top, the lock will open.
[37:25.76]Okay, sapphire.

[38:09.59]Alright, I can hold it.
[38:12.35]So go get the bow, you guys are saying.
[38:18.95]What kind of character do I want to be?
[38:21.29]Before you can use the bow, you'll need arrows.
[38:22.71]Check the skeleton to see what he contains.
[38:24.22]He had arrows.
[38:26.40]Take them all.
[38:27.70]And take the torch.
[38:28.36]And take the dagger.
[38:33.38]To use a bow, you'll need to have both the bow and some arrows equipped.
[38:36.82]Go into your inventory and equip them now.
[38:40.37]Okay.
[38:42.35]So, rusty bow and iron arrow.
[38:47.78]I can't see anymore, though.
[38:50.96]Now you're ready to practice with your bow.
[38:52.40]The bucket near the well will make a good target.
[38:54.82]To draw an aim, push L button.
[38:56.80]Release... Push L button.
[39:05.71]Didn't even need a second.
[39:06.55]Nice shot.
[39:06.93]You can retrieve arrows from the world as well as recovering some of the arrows you fire into enemies.
[39:14.37]I want a torch, though.
[39:15.01]Can I hold the torch in my mouth?
[39:19.30]Where'd it go?
[39:19.74]Inside?
[39:20.06]Alright.
[39:22.58]So, I'll use the bow for a little bit.
[39:24.06]Why not, right?
[39:29.58]Um...
[39:34.05]Omega Nate did a little bit of an emote there with fire on it.
[39:39.09]Cool, that's awesome.
[39:39.89]Omega Nate, nice work.
[39:41.89]Pretty good use of the emotes, I would say.
[39:52.50]Okay, nice work, man.
[40:04.28]Well, experiment failed.
[40:05.84]Etalyx, it didn't happen.
[40:07.64]It didn't happen.
[40:08.54]Etalyx is here.
[40:09.46]Etalyx, it didn't happen.
[40:11.18]I lost.
[40:11.61]I lost our friendly bet.
[40:17.11]Watch out for the rats!
[40:21.57]I'm gonna die!
[40:22.15]Can I just eat raw rat meat?
[40:29.79]uh what bet what what bet uh we had a friendly bet that if I said somebody's name in chat that immediately after no matter what it was everyone was going to tell me to mod him he was right I was wrong what kind of run is this your marksman skill has increased is there pig over here
[41:07.95]Okay, does Marksman suck?
[41:09.87]Should I not be doing this?
[41:18.44]Is this a stupid idea?
[41:19.24]Oh, by the way, I'm trying... There's no reload.
[41:23.16]Why am I pressing reload?
[41:30.70]Bow is great.
[41:32.38]No, you know what?
[41:33.08]I'm gonna do... I'm not gonna ask any questions, okay?
[41:36.26]I'm just going to do what I think is right, what I feel is right.
[41:38.60]And what I'm going to do is... We'll find out.
[41:42.02]You'll see.
[41:42.36]It's going to be a surprise.
[41:43.68]How am I about to die?
[41:53.35]I have, like, full health.
[41:59.57]Is it bullet drop in this game?
[42:02.34]Yeah, there is.
[42:12.11]crouch I don't want to even do this I don't want a bow and arrow nobody told me to do this I'm doing it for no reason I don't even like playing this kind of character in any game bullet drop well it's the same it's the it's the same theory
[42:38.02]Sneak attack for x2 damage.
[42:39.49]That's a sneak.
[42:40.25]Okay.
[42:41.63]Good to know.
[42:43.13]My marksman skill has increased.
[42:44.85]I'm going to force myself into this, aren't I?
[42:52.18]Use a sword.
[42:53.26]I can't.
[42:53.56]I've already leveled up in my marksman ability.
[42:55.26]I can't turn it off now.
[43:00.94]I've made my decision.
[43:03.30]I'm going to throw rocks at people.
[43:07.22]Where's this rat?
[43:07.88]There he is.
[43:08.26]Let's just jump over that.
[43:16.94]Can I eat the rat meat?
[43:19.32]Can I eat the rat meat?
[43:19.94]Am I gonna starve?
[43:21.13]Am I gonna starve?
[43:24.45]Is it a coconut?
[43:25.33]Hold on, I hear a rat.
[43:35.40]Press C.
[43:40.17]The fuck was that?
[43:44.93]I didn't even... I didn't put that on.
[43:46.41]Why don't I... Oh, I put the robe on!
[43:48.07]I put on the robes!
[43:49.69]That makes sense.
[43:52.41]Click on the spell icon at the bottom of the journal to bring up the magic tab.
[44:00.22]Heal minor wounds.
[44:01.40]Okay, because I put this on and it gave me these two spells.
[44:03.64]That's kind of cool.
[44:04.22]It's like Path of Exile.
[44:07.08]You guys didn't tell me that.
[44:07.86]That's so awesome!
[44:11.04]That makes sense.
[44:11.50]Alright, let's get the coconut.
[44:16.32]Lettuce.
[44:17.32]Iron shield.
[44:17.98]Tomato.
[44:19.54]Cheese wedge.
[44:22.86]I could probably sell these, right?
[44:23.90]I could sell all the people's bones.
[44:28.36]That's an iron warhammer.
[44:30.62]Okay, I need to look at that.
[44:36.36]Sixty.
[44:42.35]Okay, I think I have another thing I want to do.
[44:44.65]Alright.
[44:52.12]Open up this thing.
[44:53.20]Cheese.
[44:54.50]I don't want it.
[44:55.22]Should I take everything?
[44:55.90]I might as well just take everything.
[44:57.82]Just sell it to some random idiot in town.
[45:01.51]I think, should we do two?
[45:04.83]One hit.
[45:05.41]That's what I want.
[45:12.18]This is kind of fun.
[45:17.16]Is the whole game kind of like this?
[45:18.38]You just do dungeon crawling?
[45:19.65]I love dungeon crawling.
[45:20.59]It's one of my favorites.
[45:27.69]Yes.
[45:28.33]Yes.
[45:30.45]That was just my shadow.
[45:31.17]I thought a person fell down.
[45:39.13]Please don't meme this game.
[45:42.21]What do you mean, meme this game?
[45:49.14]This is fun.
[45:51.30]What do I mean, meme the game?
[45:54.12]Caps lock.
[45:55.93]Okay.
[45:58.79]I wish I could see better.
[46:03.93]Mushroom?
[46:04.95]You can even pick up the mushrooms.
[46:07.07]No, you can't.
[46:07.54]Oh, well.
[46:10.08]Potion of healing, potion of healing, weak potion of sorcery.
[46:12.72]I'm assuming that's a mana potion.
[46:14.96]You know what?
[46:15.49]Might as well just do it.
[46:20.45]I harvest wisp stalks.
[46:25.75]This is fun.
[46:26.59]So unused to playing good games.
[46:29.61]What?
[46:31.85]I just played Spider-Man like four days ago.
[46:36.41]What are you talking about?
[46:39.26]You can hotkey items and spells from your journal by holding down a number key, then clicking the item you want in that slot.
[46:46.79]Pressing this number while exploring will equip that item instantly.
[46:51.39]Okay.
[46:52.11]Hold down a number key and then click the item I want.
[46:56.01]So one is going to be... Okay.
[47:04.38]Two...
[47:08.88]Understand I'm gonna say one should be potion of healing Two is gonna be weak potion of sorcery three is gonna be cheese wedge.
[47:18.26]No, it's not lettuce.
[47:20.00]No, that's fine Finally we can see light Find nothing find nothing I am gonna go like this though.
[47:32.17]Oh
[47:34.34]No, where's the controls?
[47:37.40]Just a little bit.
[47:38.18]It's just a little too much.
[47:40.56]That's good.
[47:45.28]Might even go even further.
[47:46.17]A little too much.
[47:56.49]Come on, I gotta Goldilocks this.
[47:59.01]Right there.
[48:01.55]That's better.
[48:03.11]Max sensitivity.
[48:06.64]No, I just got it right.
[48:07.68]No.
[48:08.28]I just got it right.
[48:20.47]Burlap vest.
[48:21.42]Alright, I get a look at some of this shit, man.
[48:23.70]You picked up more than you can carry.
[48:25.04]In order to move again, you'll need to drop some items.
[48:26.94]So push tab to bring up your... Fuck, I can't... You actually can't physically move?
[48:33.72]Explain in the lower left of your inventory page.
[48:35.54]Yeah, there it is.
[48:36.30]Shift-click to drop items you don't need.
[48:37.88]Alright, let's sort by expensive, right?
[48:44.52]Expensive, stink cap.
[48:49.12]What's like the most expensive?
[48:50.56]Iron, that's what I'm carrying, steel short sword.
[48:52.90]Eh.
[48:57.11]Drop the flesh?
[48:58.23]No, drop the dumb ax.
[49:00.83]Rusty War Axe.
[49:02.50]Club.
[49:03.42]Rusty.
[49:03.86]Anything with rusty I don't want.
[49:07.40]This thing actually... How much damage does this thing do?
[49:13.02]Drop the rat meat.
[49:15.96]Oh, but I... Hold on.
[49:26.47]No, that's not intimidating.
[49:28.05]Put the sandals on
[49:31.43]Put on the wrist things.
[49:34.49]Drop the... Drop the... You want me to drop the rat meat so bad?
[49:41.39]It's not even taking up that much space.
[49:48.82]I'm sorry, I ate most of it.
[49:51.50]Alright, that's good.
[49:53.48]I'm good to go.
[49:55.29]That goblin up ahead hasn't seen you yet.
[49:57.23]You may be able to sneak up by him.
[50:00.24]To go into sneak mode, press left control.
[50:06.28]Notice that the crosshair changes to an eye while you are sneaking.
[50:09.18]If the eye is dim, no one can detect you.
[50:12.08]If the eye is bright, someone can detect you.
[50:17.47]How do you do sneak attack?
[50:27.35]Still sneaking.
[50:28.23]Can you see me?
[50:30.63]Well, I botched that.
[50:31.59]Okay, whatever.
[50:35.19]Your fatigue is low and you cannot do as much melee damage.
[50:37.66]Fatigue returns slowly on its own, especially while walking instead of running.
[50:41.86]The green bar at the bottom left displays your current fatigue.
[50:45.00]That makes sense.
[50:49.10]Potion of Illness.
[50:51.78]You found a mortar and pestle.
[50:53.08]Equip it to create potions or poisons from ingredients with like effects.
[50:58.97]Equip it to create potions or poisons from ingredients with like effects.
[51:06.21]So, like effects.
[51:07.85]Your alchemy skill will make your creations more powerful.
[51:10.47]Cool!
[51:11.49]Garlic and radishes.
[51:20.15]Alright.
[51:27.57]Did I open this already?
[51:31.61]Stop picking up rat meat.
[51:33.21]Why?
[51:34.15]Did my sensitivity go back to what it was?
[51:35.91]I feel like these sliders don't do anything.
[51:41.71]Now it feels... Now it feels normal.
[51:43.65]Okay.
[51:48.52]Eat all the rats.
[51:50.10]I mean, I will.
[51:50.68]Don't tell me to do that.
[51:51.40]I'll do it.
[51:51.92]Let's go over here.
[51:58.84]He saw me.
[52:03.97]Alright, come in the light so I can see you.
[52:08.93]One hit.
[52:10.73]Fair pelt.
[52:11.35]Two gold.
[52:12.73]Like this.
[52:14.24]Do it again.
[52:17.20]That's a pretty effective spell.
[52:24.56]Nobody here.
[52:26.94]Is it really that dark?
[52:27.82]I mean, it is.
[52:30.13]Should I put the brightness up or is this just kind of like get good?
[52:35.81]I mean, I'll try to get good if that's the case, but just let me know.
[52:40.05]Tell me.
[52:47.54]Something over here that I can pick up, probably.
[52:50.68]Yep.
[53:00.19]Who?
[53:00.31]Oh, no.
[53:02.65]No.
[53:09.21]I didn't even mean to do that.
[53:10.41]I did it right.
[53:13.20]That works.
[53:13.84]Iron arrow.
[53:15.14]Take them all.
[53:15.74]Rusty dagger.
[53:16.42]Don't even take it.
[53:18.40]Take the lockpicks, though, because why not?
[53:20.28]What happened there?
[53:25.07]What?
[53:25.25]It's alright.
[53:27.77]I got a replacement.
[53:35.11]Your log dropping skill has increased.
[53:38.18]Heh heh.
[53:41.46]First boss.
[53:41.94]I can't even see this guy swinging.
[53:55.33]I can't even see.
[53:56.33]I can't even see.
[53:56.81]You know what I mean?
[53:57.33]I can't even see.
[53:57.75]Am I supposed to not be able to see?
[53:58.63]Should I turn it bright?
[53:59.33]I can't even see.
[54:02.81]What?
[54:03.29]Oh my god.
[54:03.91]What the fuck was that?
[54:18.90]I do no damage?
[54:20.18]Well, I have like a... I have a big two-hander.
[54:23.01]This should be doing damage, shouldn't it?
[54:24.33]Oh, you're talking about the other guy.
[54:41.85]Should I turn the difficulty up?
[54:56.16]I'm not putting it on max difficulty.
[54:58.04]That's not a smart idea.
[54:59.36]I don't know.
[55:02.71]He's like a shaman.
[55:03.31]What's he doing?
[55:04.81]Ow.
[55:11.47]Oh, God!
[55:15.91]That turned the difficulty up!
[55:16.89]Why did I do that?
[55:18.91]I should have turned the difficulty down!
[55:23.89]Your magicka is low, and you may not be able to cast spells.
[55:27.17]Magicka returns slowly on its own, or you can increase it by drinking potions or sleeping.
[55:31.18]The blue bar is magicka.
[55:36.52]What the, wait, why is this guy, okay, well, there it is, dead.
[55:40.54]I just tried to drink a potion.
[55:47.11]So what happened, why, oh my fucking god.
[55:56.36]Are we getting comp casted?
[56:03.26]No, I think we're alright.
[56:07.24]Can I block his lightning?
[56:09.28]Why was that so fucking loud?
[56:20.71]Can I?
[56:21.67]I don't think I can block that.
[56:26.48]Can you imagine?
[56:34.48]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:43.35]Oh my god.
[56:51.99]Oh my god.
[56:54.47]Why are you still alive?
[57:03.64]Whoa!
[57:14.37]Is this even the same guy?
[57:15.55]Oh my God, finally, okay.
[57:21.99]Got him.
[57:24.13]Goblin, Shaman, Staff.
[57:30.83]Applaud Ruby.
[57:31.67]Cool.
[57:32.67]Petty Soul Gem.
[57:34.79]Goblin Staff.
[57:35.47]180.
[57:35.77]A shock damage.
[57:37.41]5 points on target.
[57:39.95]Did I get a rare?
[57:43.89]Nice.
[57:44.25]I got a rare.
[57:45.89]Let's put it on.
[57:46.41]I need more charge.
[58:01.60]I thought that was a pot of gold.
[58:02.73]Why would you do that to me, game?
[58:09.43]Tons of money.
[58:10.09]Tons of nuggets.
[58:10.75]Tons of repair hammers.
[58:11.65]Tons of vases.
[58:13.63]You found a repair hammer.
[58:14.63]Equip it to repair your weapons and armor using your armorer skill.
[58:21.06]Damaged weapons and armor are less effective, so it's wise to keep them in good repair.
[58:24.02]Okay.
[58:27.40]How much does it take to do this?
[58:34.59]Charge 6 out of 150.
[58:41.83]How do I get this to charge?
[58:43.37]Do I have to sleep with it in the bed?
[58:46.91]Use is 0.
[58:47.29]Like, if this thing goes to sleep, will it have charges?
[58:58.46]Soul gem.
[58:59.36]Petty.
[59:02.38]Soul, 150 points.
[59:06.46]Oh.
[59:08.54]Okay.
[59:09.26]Oh, now it's got it.
[59:12.04]I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[59:18.24]Because I feel like that's probably a smarter idea.
[59:27.30]Weak healing potion and then sorcery potion.
[59:31.65]Okay.
[59:32.61]So I don't... That'll work.
[59:38.91]Alright, that was it.
[59:39.97]Now let's go to town and turn it in.
[59:42.50]I don't even know what I'm... I don't even know what's happening.
[59:46.21]They left me.
[59:46.95]That's all I remember.
[59:48.73]Iron longsword.
[59:49.57]Two for fuck.
[60:10.80]What weighs the most?
[60:11.80]This thing, but is that, why is it, ah, no, it needs to be repaired.
[60:17.50]Rusty iron bow.
[60:21.01]Rusty iron shield.
[60:21.87]I'm not going to use a shield.
[60:24.23]I don't think I ever will.
[60:25.05]Is this the rat meat?
[60:37.05]I have so much rat meat.
[60:38.17]Where is it?
[60:42.19]I have 16.
[60:46.71]Drop the apples.
[60:49.54]And drop the... Drop the fucking lettuce.
[60:54.08]And the mort flesh.
[60:55.50]Alright, we're good.
[61:00.94]Oh, bones too.
[61:01.68]I have a bunch of bones.
[61:07.47]Why am I... These are so heavy.
[61:09.83]Why did I pick these up?
[61:12.20]Did they do anything?
[61:16.38]Eat the food.
[61:16.98]Oh, fuck, where's that lettuce?
[61:20.00]Alright, eat it.
[61:22.38]No, no, no.
[61:22.80]I want the rat meat.
[61:27.58]Apple.
[61:28.66]Lettuce.
[61:29.72]Alright, eat it.
[61:30.22]Okay, good.
[61:40.26]That was delicious.
[61:55.42]Now where?
[61:56.56]Down?
[62:03.76]Down here?
[62:12.67]Tunnel.
[62:13.03]Where's the tunnel?
[62:15.38]I don't see a tunnel.
[62:16.78]This way?
[62:21.64]Ah!
[62:21.76]I remember this way.
[62:30.56]Take all the arrows.
[62:31.38]I don't know what I want to do.
[62:32.28]It's just so open-ended.
[62:36.88]Am I a weirdo, or is this game more fun than Skyrim?
[62:39.94]The first 10 minutes.
[62:41.10]The first 20 minutes.
[62:47.80]Am I crazy for signing that?
[62:55.73]Alright, I made it.
[62:56.73]Can I throw this?
[62:57.49]Are they coming after me?
[63:14.03]Alright, I helped.
[63:14.71]What?
[63:14.91]Whoa, huh?

[63:49.78]The nine guide and protect us.
[63:51.28]I'm not on good terms with the gods.
[63:52.80]I don't know.
[63:53.28]I don't think about it.
[63:54.68]I don't think I'm on very good terms with the gods.
[63:56.14]I've served the nine all my days, and I chart my course by the cycles of the heavens.
[64:02.72]The skies are marked with numberless Sparks, each a fire, and every one a sign.
[64:09.85]I know these stars well, and I wonder which sign marked your birth.
[64:14.95]Okay.
[64:16.09]I gotta pick my sign.
[64:18.29]The apprentice, the lady, the mage, the thief, the aristocrat, the lord, the lover, the ritual, the serpent, or the shadow.
[64:25.98]What birthday?
[64:26.50]Okay, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[64:27.04]I'm the serpent.
[64:28.28]Wait, hold on a minute.
[64:29.02]9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[64:29.12]Alright, there are 13 years.

[64:43.06]January, February, March, February, June, July, August, September, October, November, December, November, okay.
[64:50.32]There's a spider on the wall.
[64:53.77]It's haunting me.
[64:57.79]Oh, no, my chat.
[64:59.43]Why is my chat doing that?
[65:00.55]I can't see chat now.
[65:02.29]And I can't alt-tab this fucking game.
[65:07.29]Wait, hold on a minute.
[65:08.75]I need to read this.
[65:12.50]Scroll.
[65:16.18]Doesn't even try.
[65:16.90]What is it?
[65:17.71]Holy shit.
[65:18.47]A bunch of gifted subs just came in.
[65:21.61]Oh, wait.
[65:21.89]What's going on?
[65:22.91]Why is my, like... Oh, my.
[65:25.17]It's scrolling on the other screen.
[65:30.61]Wait.
[65:31.07]Why is that happening?
[65:32.43]Why is it scrolling my chat and my dashboard?
[65:40.62]Oh, fuck.
[65:41.74]Hey, wait.
[65:46.51]Alright, let me look at these.
[65:49.15]100 point bonus to your Magicka attribute gives you 100% weakness to magic.
[65:52.27]Don't, no, don't want it.
[65:53.25]10 points to your willpower and endurance.
[65:58.82]Permanent bonus of 50 points to your Magicka.
[66:03.70]The ability grants a 10 point bonus to your agility.
[66:08.16]Speed and luck.
[66:11.57]The astronaut ability you don't regain magicka over time is to do a 50% spell absorption to recharge your magicka.
[66:18.32]Your base magicka is also increased.
[66:19.82]Okay.
[66:25.72]The Lord.
[66:26.40]Being born under the Lord gives you the Blood of the North Lesser Power to regenerate up to 90 points of health.
[66:33.20]However, you also gain the Trollkin Curse, a permanent 25% weakness to fire.
[66:40.83]Use the Lover's Kiss power once a day to paralyze an opponent for 10 seconds.
[66:46.03]That's dumb.
[66:47.31]Those born under the ritual use the Mara's Gift power once a day as a powerful restore health spell.
[66:55.07]The Blessed Word can turn the undead.
[66:57.77]Dumb.
[66:58.97]Gain the Serpent spell to cause a slow but potent poison on touch.
[67:03.35]While simultaneously curing yourself and dispelling magic on yourself, casting this spell costs 100 points of fatigue.
[67:10.76]no use the moon shadow power once a day to become invisible for 60 seconds I like that one that's that's that's the one that's uh on tap right here get invisible for a minute that sounds pretty amazing the steed ability grants a bonus of 20 to your speed once a day open a door or container of average lock level or less the tower warden reflects five points of damage for 120 seconds once a day
[67:43.08]Bonus of 10 points to your strength and endurance.
[67:45.24]I kind of want to be invisible.
[67:50.84]Astronaut?
[67:57.61]You don't regain magicka.
[67:59.43]Instead, you have a 50% spell of joy, so when you take damage, it recharges your magicka.
[68:03.59]And you get more magicka.
[68:08.27]But I can go invisible.
[68:10.28]Isn't that fun?
[68:16.50]Thief ability grants a 10 point bonus to your agility, speed, and luck.
[68:19.54]That's actually pretty great.
[68:24.08]Steed, steed, steed.
[68:26.36]Who cares about how fast you are?
[68:29.88]I'll throw up if I do steed.
[68:31.50]I won't be able to handle that.
[68:34.95]I'm thinking thief, astronaut, or the shadow.
[68:41.57]I'm leaning towards the shadow here.
[68:43.93]Let me think.
[68:49.18]Let's see.
[68:50.10]Let's do like a... Let's eliminate them.
[68:52.10]Let's see.
[68:52.42]Okay, so... Do... Let's see.
[68:57.61]Do you have the time to listen to me whine about nothing and everything all at once?
[69:10.36]Okay, so it's that one.
[69:23.70]Too fast?
[69:25.54]I guess I could, hold on.
[69:29.11]I am one of those melodramatic fools, neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it.
[69:40.22]Oh, it landed on the shadow.
[69:43.34]might as well just continue sometimes I give myself the creeps sometimes my mind plays tricks on me it all keeps adding up I think I'm cracking up am I just paranoid or am I weird the signs I read show the end of my path
[70:10.39]My death, a necessary end, will come when it will come.
[70:21.16]Alright, well, that's where we got it.
[70:26.34]What about me?
[70:27.44]Your stars are not mine.
[70:29.02]What did I just pick?
[70:29.76]Today, the Atronauk shall aid you with your appointed burden.
[70:35.65]Can you see my face?
[70:36.79]Is there something on my face?
[70:38.34]My dreams grant me no opinions of success.
[70:41.74]Their compass ventures not beyond the doors of death.
[70:45.87]But in your face, I behold the sun's companion.
[70:49.07]I told you there was something on my face.
[70:50.21]The dawn of Akatosh's bright glory may banish the coming darkness.
[70:52.63]Wipe that shit off your face.
[70:55.69]With such hope, and with the promise of your aid, my heart must be satisfied.
[71:02.12]What did I choose?
[71:02.96]Uh... Atronach.
[71:08.52]A Tronach.
[71:11.82]So I have to be a magic user then.
[71:14.18]Easy, I'll do it.
[71:15.06]Backseaters resigned?
[71:15.88]Why not?
[71:31.35]You pick no magic regen.
[71:33.61]You get magic by getting hurt.
[71:34.93]So I'm going to be a tank.
[71:36.17]I'm going to put all my points into endurance and get the best staff in the game.
[71:40.97]And I'm going to shoot electricity at people.
[71:42.82]This is not what you signed up for?
[71:44.00]I did.
[71:44.62]I go to my grave.
[71:47.22]A tongue shriller than all the music calls me.
[71:51.10]You shall follow me yet for a while.
[71:53.89]Then we must part.
[72:01.20]I wish I could fucking alt tab right now so bad.
[72:03.02]The blades!
[72:03.34]Okay.
[72:06.78]Alright, that's cool man.
[72:33.52]Let's just get it saved.
[72:36.46]Okay.
[72:36.94]Not much fun.
[73:17.99]I don't know why I want to play that right now.
[73:20.73]Why do I want to play that?
[73:25.29]Don't you- that was how we did- that was our choice!
[73:32.32]You know I'm gonna play that at every boss now, you know that, right?
[73:37.16]Every major fight that has to happen, I'm gonna play it until we win.
[73:40.52]Is this a boss?
[73:48.26]Done.
[73:49.46]Is this a boss?
[73:50.92]Should I play it?
[73:51.54]No, it's not a boss.
[73:54.16]Of course it's not a boss.
[73:55.14]What am I, stupid?
[73:57.30]I'm not picking up shit anymore.
[74:03.50]Yeah, let's do it.
[74:10.62]Ow!
[74:10.92]What?
[74:13.18]I don't even know which one is the Emperor.
[74:15.60]Could be any of you.
[74:21.96]I'm just a guy.
[74:25.02]I'm just a Binding of Isaac companion.
[74:28.53]They do all the work and then I'm like the bum that comes over and just picks up the coin.
[74:42.71]Hold up.
[74:44.19]He's dead.
[74:51.46]He's gonna get snatched up from the ceiling or something.
[74:54.76]Just watch.
[74:55.40]It's gonna be like... Here he comes.
[74:58.51]Here comes the boss.
[75:14.18]This guy is dead.
[75:14.88]Protect the Emperor!
[75:15.38]Protect the Emperor!
[75:16.77]Protect the Emperor!
[75:34.94]It's a dead end.
[75:36.02]What's your call, sir?
[75:37.59]They're behind us.
[75:38.83]Wait here, sire.
[75:39.95]Wait here with the emperor.
[75:41.07]Guard him with your lamp.
[75:42.27]Oh, shit.
[75:42.69]You're going to make me... Now we're alone.
[75:46.65]You thought we'd go down easy?
[75:49.51]My sword or the dragon.
[75:51.59]I can go no further.
[75:53.07]You alone must stand against the prince of destruction and his mortal servants.
[75:56.95]He actually just gave it to me.
[75:57.95]You must not have the amulet of kings.
[76:01.51]okay take the amulet give it to joffrey he alone knows where to find my last son find him and close shut the jaws of oblivion this is the guy does he die here or something hey let's go buddy
[76:31.73]What is... You didn't give me a chance to... I don't know.
[76:35.68]I don't have it.
[76:36.24]I don't know.
[76:36.52]Can he not die?
[77:01.08]Most people think of the red dragon crown, but that's just jewelry.
[77:05.46]The amulet has power.
[77:07.34]Only a true heir of the blood can wear it, they say.
[77:09.92]Shut up.
[77:10.73]He must have given it to you for a reason.
[77:12.79]Did he say why?
[77:13.99]He said he wanted me to smash it and then sprinkle it all over the world.
[77:18.87]And everybody will have $50,000.
[77:20.15]Joffrey, he said that?
[77:21.15]Why?
[77:26.76]Nothing I ever heard about.
[77:28.37]But Joffrey would be the one to know.
[77:30.59]He's the Grand Master of my Order.
[77:33.43]Although you may not think so to meet him, he lives quietly as a monk at Weynon Priory, near the city of Coral.
[77:42.65]First, you need to get out of here.
[77:44.95]Through that door must be the entrance to the sewers, past the locked gate.
[77:48.50]That's where we were heading.
[77:50.89]It's a secret way out of the Imperial City.
[77:53.47]Or it was supposed to be secret.
[77:55.65]Here, you'll need this key for the last door to the sewer.
[78:00.57]There are rats and goblins down there.
[78:02.85]But from what I've seen of you, I'm guessing you're an experienced monk.
[78:06.77]Am I right?
[78:08.91]I've eaten a rat or two, yeah.
[78:11.59]You now must choose your class.
[78:13.21]The major skills of your class will start higher than your other skills.
[78:18.16]You will increase your level by raising these major skills.
[78:26.59]Ancient.
[78:33.06]Witch hunter.
[78:33.92]There's too many things here.
[78:40.12]You know what I'm saying?
[78:43.02]I'm just going to have to go by which one is the... Which one I like the... What artwork I like the most.
[78:49.22]Not that one.
[78:51.04]That's like Zelda.
[78:54.24]No.
[78:56.06]No, he's, like, smelling it.
[78:57.06]That's weird to me.
[79:00.66]I kind of like the hamburger helper glove he has on.
[79:03.90]But besides that, I'm not sure.
[79:05.42]I admit it, but the weird, like, snake hair, I like it.
[79:09.72]That's pretty cool.
[79:11.89]No.
[79:14.15]Okay, for a second I thought this guy had a cell phone and was taking a picture, like, of his ass.
[79:19.51]Like he was trying to, like, take a picture of his girlfriend or something.
[79:26.11]Okay.
[79:28.11]Pilgrim.
[79:32.72]Nightblade.
[79:36.28]What's custom class?
[79:38.42]Choose your specialization.
[79:39.58]Specialized skills get plus 10 and increase faster.
[79:42.10]Magic, stealth, or combat.
[79:48.25]Alchemy, alteration, conjuration, destruction, illusion, mysticism, and restoration.
[79:56.14]Acrobatics, Light Armor, Marksman, Mercantile, Security, Sneak, and Speechcraft.
[80:02.16]I don't know.
[80:15.69]Let's go Stealth.
[80:17.89]But I'm so bad at that.
[80:19.23]I don't do that ever.
[80:27.10]I'm going to have to be a bow and arrow guy.
[80:29.00]I'll try it.
[80:36.63]Choose your two favorite attributes.
[80:38.25]You will gain plus five to each.
[80:39.47]Intelligence, willpower, personality, or luck.
[80:44.26]Which one of these are mine, right?
[80:46.26]If I was to put these in.
[80:51.94]You suck at stealth.
[81:00.86]Mage tank.
[81:09.01]What an oxymoron.
[81:11.57]Personality.
[81:12.25]Affects how much people like you.
[81:14.71]Which leads to better information gathering.
[81:16.50]Governs the skill of speechcraft.
[81:18.82]Mercantile and illusion.
[81:21.14]Anyways, hold on a second here.
[81:22.40]I miss...
[81:26.25]M Harmless.
[81:27.39]M Harmless.

[81:43.34]Thank you so much, dude.
[81:46.50]Thank you for your incredibly generous contribution here, Harmless.
[81:50.10]Thank you.

[82:22.36]Before I make a character, a lot of times, if I've just been playing something off-stream, I will sit at this screen for, like, an hour.
[82:29.58]And I will look up on every Wikipedia everything about each one of these.
[82:38.08]But, like, we don't necessarily have the time for that.
[82:41.91]You know what I mean?
[82:45.03]I would say we're pretty much... Like, we don't necessarily have that time.
[82:50.57]So we're going to have to...
[82:53.62]Okay, so far.
[82:54.85]Agilities are not bad, I don't think.
[83:02.47]I can go with willpower, that sounds like a good one.
[83:24.63]Lock sounds alright.
[83:25.55]What do we got?
[83:40.73]Willpower and personality.
[83:44.85]What is willpower?
[83:46.37]No, I can't regen.
[83:50.05]I can't regen power.
[83:53.08]Oh, can we refund it?
[83:55.10]I don't want personality, though.
[83:56.58]But the... It's fucking useless.
[84:06.36]I physically can't regen power.
[84:08.16]Can I get one more time?
[84:10.16]Can I get a do-over for willpower?
[84:13.94]We're gonna... I'll keep personality, fine.
[84:21.42]Goddammit, I...
[84:26.53]No, just pick one.
[84:28.68]Pick which one am I picking.
[84:32.24]I have to have like a bit for everything.
[84:33.98]I don't know.
[84:44.06]It's over.
[84:47.46]Oh, God.
[84:47.84]No.
[84:47.90]Oh, God.
[84:56.04]You added so many more things, personality and endurance.
[85:03.84]I'm just going to do my birthday.
[85:05.54]You know what I mean?
[85:06.22]Like, hold on acrobatics.
[85:08.66]This is so cool.

[85:41.77]I like that.
[85:43.36]I think I'm going to have to do this one.
[85:44.54]I can choose seven of these.
[85:58.43]Maintain weapons and armor at top efficient.
[86:00.70]Warm weapons and armor are less effective.
[86:04.46]Cast spells to breathe or walk on water.
[86:09.64]Block parry melee attacks with shields and weapons.
[86:11.94]Successful blocks reduce damage.
[86:13.23]Blunt.
[86:14.81]What did we pick?
[86:18.21]Deliver the crushing blow of a mace and axe weapons more effectively.
[86:20.99]Maybe I should do alchemy.
[86:27.44]I pick up so much shit.
[86:28.44]Acrobatics.
[86:30.90]Yeah, let's just be like the naked guy, right?

[88:10.98]What's wrong with a mace?
[88:13.76]A light armor tank.
[88:15.38]Oh, you're right.
[88:15.88]Thanks for correcting me.
[88:18.40]Use of iron, steel, dwarven, orcish, ebony, and daedric armors.
[88:26.51]Light armor stealth tank mage.
[88:29.57]No weapon specializations?
[88:30.90]Don't I have... Just... No.
[88:39.68]Let's get rid of the stupid one.
[88:40.86]Who cares how far you can jump?
[88:44.12]We'll do blunt.
[88:45.56]Axes and maces.
[88:49.34]Alright, so we got Alchemy, Athletics, because that's cool.
[88:53.74]Blunt, Destruction, Heavy Armor, and Illusion.

[90:53.00]Oh, yeah.
[90:53.34]We've got the Crusader, the Healer, the Knight, the Mage, and the Magistank.
[91:00.63]What is... This is not what I... I didn't get to pick that?
[91:07.25]Alright, we're going to be Maj's stank.
[91:12.71]I wasn't far off.
[91:14.05]In any case, rats and goblins won't give you any trouble.
[91:20.34]Did I like ruin this whole game?
[91:21.86]Take no chances, but proceed to wane in priory immediately.
[91:25.70]Got it?
[91:26.70]That was fun.
[91:28.34]Yes, I understand.
[91:29.10]Good.
[91:30.00]The Emperor's trust was well placed.
[91:33.33]What about you?
[91:33.83]What are you going to do?
[91:34.44]I'll stay here to guard the Emperor's body and make sure no one follows you.
[91:38.38]You better get moving.
[91:40.02]May Talos guide you.
[91:42.12]By the way, thanks for recovering Captain Renault's sword.
[91:45.24]I'll see that it is given a place of honor in the halls of the blades.
[91:49.61]Yeah.
[91:51.59]Alright, man.
[91:53.75]So now, let me take a look.
[91:55.98]I've discovered a notice from Snank... Snack... I thought that was me.
[92:00.35]Like, Stank Snack.
[92:01.97]Snack Grabura of the Chestnut Handy Stables.
[92:05.05]She's offering to outfit a horse with armor at no charge to anyone who presents her with a note like the one that I've found.
[92:11.50]I shall bring my horse to her and take advantage of this offer.
[92:15.60]Uh, sure.
[92:16.04]Make this my quest.
[92:18.95]That...
[92:22.05]Centuries ago, a great battle took place in Anvil Bay in the battle of the legendary pirate Toradan ap Dugal, the captain of the infamous Black Flag, was defeated by the First Count of Anvil.
[92:33.56]Rumors have been circulating of a hidden underground cavern beneath Castle Anvil.
[92:37.48]If the rumors are to be believed, then the final resting place of Captain Dugal and his ship have been uncovered.
[92:44.27]I should investigate these rumors as soon as possible.
[92:49.29]I like that one.
[92:51.23]Alright, so how do we get out of here?
[92:56.67]Amulet of Kings, the blades.
[92:58.39]Where's like, how do I leave?
[92:59.51]Can I just leave?
[93:09.16]You need to get out of here.
[93:10.98]Needs a key.
[93:14.36]This is the first quest is a DLC quest.
[93:18.54]Really?
[93:18.76]That's weird.
[93:22.66]Go back to where the Emperor died.
[93:24.18]He's right here.
[93:25.24]Leave the Emperor in peace.
[93:27.10]Oh, I can't just, like, take his stuff?
[93:35.71]Boris' key!
[93:36.73]You've opened the door.
[93:39.31]And now your adventure begins.
[93:46.22]I've heard talk of the lost city called Varsavali, where Maffroon's razor is hidden.
[93:53.48]If I search the ruins of Sondercliff, watch in the eastern Niben, I may be able to find the lost city and recover this powerful... Yeah, let's do that.
[94:01.31]That sounds fun.
[94:06.46]According to a deed that's been delivered to me, I've inherited a property called the Frostcrag Spire from a long-lost relative.
[94:11.86]I've marked its location on my map, but the next opportunity, I should make my way out of there and inspect my new acquisition.
[94:18.10]I like that one.
[94:18.70]That one's interesting.
[94:19.28]Go see, like, the uncle.
[94:20.20]Let's do that one.
[94:22.05]According to a mysterious message that's been delivered to me, I've inherited an underground lair called Deep SCORN Hollow from a long-lost relative.
[94:28.01]It's situated at the south post... Yes, sure.
[94:30.61]Let's go inspect it.
[94:31.99]I'd love to do it.
[94:32.65]That sounds like fun.
[94:34.58]I've heard a rumor that the defenders of Battlehorn Castle... I would love to do this one.
[94:38.02]Let me do this.
[94:38.52]Make this my active quest.
[94:43.04]Is that it?
[94:48.22]No more?
[94:49.85]Okay.
[94:51.51]Now let's be the real... Tankas... Stankamank.
[94:55.25]Whatever the hell the name is.
[95:04.10]What's wrong with me?
[95:05.52]Almost stuck.
[95:17.10]The glass sucks.
[95:21.20]No it doesn't.
[95:21.78]Do not say that.
[95:22.60]Don't you dare say that about the tanker stank ever again.
[95:51.78]Okay, see?
[95:52.78]The build's pretty good.
[95:54.02]Don't pick that up.
[95:56.38]Italian.
[95:56.92]Eat more garlic.
[96:03.32]Let's get a Magistank rant going.
[96:08.29]Wait, did I just say Ragistank?
[96:14.01]I forgot the name of the clip.
[96:14.77]Magistank.
[96:16.83]I said Tankastank.
[96:19.73]That works too.
[96:20.51]It all works.
[96:20.93]It doesn't matter.
[96:26.65]Fragistank.
[96:30.04]Oh, there is a thing over there I can pick up.
[96:34.18]Flower.
[96:35.38]Damage personality.
[96:39.82]If you eat flower in front of somebody, they're going to
[96:42.92]awkwardly laugh at you and that would fuck up your personality it'd be like whoa dude fucking guys this guy's a weirdo so that makes sense nice let's go over here
[97:10.65]I might as well just use it how am I gonna yeah I have to do the whole build okay up here
[97:39.40]What?
[97:39.88]That didn't hit him in the face?
[97:43.77]Why are these bouncing right in front of him?
[97:48.01]He's not... It stanked.
[98:05.40]Do I have like a let there be light spell?
[98:09.40]There we go.
[98:09.90]I gotta sneak around.
[98:10.60]I gotta use my namesake, right?
[98:15.23]Anything down here?
[98:17.15]Gate to city aisle.
[98:18.31]I think I have to go that way.
[98:23.45]This gate is sealed.
[98:24.75]I believe this is the way to go.
[98:30.69]Before exiting the sewers, you may revise your character.
[98:36.07]No.
[98:37.59]This is your last chance to fix your mistakes, implying that anything I did was a mistake.
[98:57.42]Discovered a note from this guy at this place.
[99:00.47]If I can get this thing that has gone away, I could make money.
[99:05.28]I should go to this place that's not the place that I previously said and see if I can figure out where this person is.
[99:11.20]Sounds fun to me.
[99:14.30]The red arrow on your compass shows the direction of Wayne and Priory.
[99:19.92]You can walk there by following your compass or you can use your world map to travel there directly or you can set off in any direction and begin exploring the world on your own.
[99:27.53]Good luck.
[99:32.83]Tutorial done.
[99:47.29]I hit the final boss in the head.
[99:49.39]On the screen.
[99:51.49]Garganon dead!
[100:00.40]Explore!
[100:00.98]Are these evil?
[100:08.75]Can you shoot arrows underwater?
[100:20.46]No, don't die here.
[100:22.96]I got him.
[100:26.40]Imagine watching somebody do this.
[100:29.02]Alright, time to bring out the big boy.
[100:30.54]I'm dead.
[100:42.45]Alright, auto save.
[100:47.63]Good thing we had, good thing I walked out the door.

[101:14.82]Where is this coming from?
[101:15.82]Let's get...

[101:19.78]I fucking hit three times, right in two, one in one peck, one in the other peck, and he was against the wall, knocked him against the wall, and he was like, don't believe.
[101:27.19]One just went right through his teeth.
[101:28.23]I hit him right in the nuts.
[101:33.73]Oh, God.
[101:34.89]Why did I say that out loud?
[101:35.95]Alright, let's, this is fun.
[101:37.37]I'm ready to explore.
[101:38.31]You guys ready?
[101:38.83]Let me try one more arrow.
[101:40.28]Let's see what happens.
[101:43.58]Dude, nice.
[101:53.80]Dude!
[101:56.32]I don't think I hit anything.
[102:05.77]No.
[102:09.45]Come on.
[102:15.59]No?

[111:08.87]What do you think I'm doing?
[111:09.76]Holy shit, like I've never seen the menu before and I'm supposed to know where to go.
[111:18.24]Alright, that's fine.
[111:23.84]So this is where we are here.
[111:27.93]I can just go anywhere, can't I?
[111:36.08]So this is where this is in the map.
[111:39.16]We're just going to do this one.
[111:41.04]So we're going to the green marker.
[111:44.89]Let's go.
[111:45.65]I'm ready.
[111:52.89]You can climb that mountain.
[111:54.03]Climb the mountain.
[111:57.68]No, I'm not.
[111:59.52]I don't want to climb.
[112:01.48]Should I climb the mountain first?
[112:11.84]I don't like this.
[112:12.64]It feels weird.
[112:14.86]Wait, did the FOV change, too?
[112:18.31]It did.
[112:18.79]I guess when you leave the game.
[112:21.09]Alright, well, there's more stuff I didn't get here.
[112:24.57]Onions.
[112:27.97]The lizard's disgusting.

[112:31.39]He's cute enough.
[112:32.23]Don't worry.
[112:34.91]I haven't had any pants on the whole time.
[112:36.31]Well, uh... Don't... Hold on.

[112:49.84]Two crabs.
[112:59.53]How does it kill?
[113:00.33]This would crush this crab instantly.
[113:08.50]I lost the chat again because I scrolled my mouse.
[113:12.12]Hold on.
[113:19.51]Let me go into another menu so I can get chat back.
[113:26.72]Why is it doing that?
[113:27.92]That's so annoying.
[113:28.70]Grab me, though.
[113:29.36]I'll take it.

[114:56.01]How long would you like to wait?
[115:00.10]Three hours.
[115:03.63]Yeah, that's good.
[115:05.15]What the fuck?
[115:10.59]What are you?
[115:17.48]Jesus.
[115:20.62]Why are these two hanging out together?
[115:22.26]I'm going to die right here.
[115:23.66]I have to run away.
[115:26.22]Try to shaman zap him.
[115:33.47]That didn't even hurt him.
[115:35.81]That didn't even hurt this guy.
[115:37.05]Alright, I didn't... I'm going the wrong way.
[115:46.74]Alright, that guy lost interest.
[115:53.88]No, he didn't.
[115:58.86]Alright.
[115:59.36]Will the crab fight anybody?
[116:00.80]It will.
[116:01.14]Good.
[116:01.36]Get him!
[116:07.81]Get the fuck away from me.
[116:09.13]I can't kill this guy.
[116:16.87]Alright, I ain't fucking with this guy.
[116:18.96]It's very clear.
[116:19.62]No, I guess I will.
[116:25.46]Oh my god, I won't.
[116:33.81]Let's get this over with.
[116:38.56]Is he at full health again?
[116:39.98]What the hell?
[116:44.06]Stop running?
[116:44.82]What do you mean stop running?
[116:45.88]I can't... I'm not gonna be able to kill this guy.
[116:47.79]I'm gonna bring him... I'll drop him off a fucking cliff.
[116:55.99]Watch.
[116:56.51]Ready?
[117:01.71]I heard a rumor that a strange doorway has appeared on a small island in the Ni-Ban Bay.
[117:07.55]I should investigate.
[117:08.71]It's one of these days.
[117:12.85]Damn it.
[117:18.44]Why am I not regaining mana?
[117:19.82]Because I apparently picked, for now, a worse thing.
[117:28.60]Is this a door?
[117:31.28]I'll turn the music on, don't worry.
[117:35.30]He's still fucking chasing me.
[117:39.56]I already zapped him and it didn't even hurt him.
[117:41.18]I just wasted a charge.
[117:44.08]The guards of this town are going to come and kill him.
[117:46.37]Just wait.
[117:47.01]Alright.
[117:47.35]Oh, there's the cliff.
[117:48.03]There's a cliff.
[117:48.61]There's a cliff.
[117:49.17]Oh, fuck.
[117:50.61]Oh, fuck.
[117:51.11]Hold on.
[117:51.81]Does it hurt?
[117:52.61]How much does it hurt?
[117:53.85]How much does it hurt to fall down?
[118:00.85]Get away from me!
[118:02.05]Did you hear him scream?
[118:31.80]Alright, no more bad guys.
[118:33.12]Or are there?
[118:41.13]You guys didn't tell me that was gonna happen.
[118:44.77]You know what?
[118:45.87]Also, something else.
[118:47.99]Excuse me, I'm bringing this back to fucking normal.
[118:52.98]I ain't dealing with the bullet sponge.
[118:56.64]What?
[118:57.38]Oh, I killed that guy.
[119:04.79]Acrobatics is useless.
[119:06.85]I didn't say that.
[119:10.93]I farted on the way down.
[119:15.21]No rewinds.
[119:16.68]No, I'm sorry.
[119:20.12]I hit that guy with a mallet.
[119:22.80]And it did not even a quarter of a centimeter of damage.
[119:28.62]What am I doing?
[119:29.14]I'm going to my rich uncle's house.
[119:34.20]I discovered a note from the guy at Arcane University.
[119:37.44]If I can recover the Dwarven artifacts that have gone missing, there may be a reward.
[119:42.40]Alright, let's track down the bandits.
[119:43.74]I don't have any healing.
[119:49.46]How do I delete my character?
[119:55.39]I'm going the worst possible way.
[119:58.77]Wait, hold on.
[119:59.15]There's like an animal here.
[120:02.47]Nice and real sneaky.
[120:16.75]Alright.
[120:17.53]Does he have wolf money?
[120:18.89]Are you drunk?
[120:24.37]I've been drinking since 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
[120:26.56]I'm shit-faced right now.
[120:28.44]I'm sorry, guys.
[120:30.02]I'm stuck.
[120:45.89]Okay, I got out.
[120:50.17]No, I haven't had one sip of alcohol.
[120:59.58]Oh, by the way, this thing sucks.
[121:02.46]Do I have anything else?
[121:08.02]No, this thing... Okay, what about... Do I have anything blunt?
[121:10.42]This is the only thing I have that's blunt.
[121:15.85]Oh, turn the music on.
[121:16.67]Yeah, sorry about that.
[121:17.79]Sorry about that, guys.
[121:18.91]I'll get it turned on for you.
[121:25.44]There.
[121:28.29]Just be careful.
[121:41.95]I'm looking over at chat because I scrolled my mouse.
[121:45.47]You guys, Imperial City Sewers, North Exit.
[121:47.53]Okay.
[121:48.77]I'm seeing... I have a stream delay for you guys.

[127:41.72]I'm fucking around.
[127:47.14]Okay, how about I go here?
[127:50.25]Travel to the stables.
[127:52.11]Imperial City Palace.
[127:53.33]Imperial City Arena.
[127:54.59]Yes, I would love to.
[127:56.01]I was outside the front door.
[128:03.73]Let's go to the palace.
[128:08.95]There we go.
[128:09.89]Thank the Lord.
[128:11.13]Save it.
[128:17.12]Wait, does it have to, like, pat me down like a Hitman game?
[128:19.24]All citizens are welcome in the Imperial Palace.
[128:22.38]At least on the first two floors.
[128:25.14]Alright.
[128:25.74]I have, like, a bunch of missions, dude.
[128:30.07]Apparently... I got too many of these.
[128:35.57]Horse armor.
[128:37.57]Chestnut Handy Stables!
[128:39.10]I don't have a horse.
[128:43.88]Take the Amulet to Joffrey.
[128:48.56]Is there anything in here?
[128:58.98]The defenders of Battlehorn Castle are besieged by marauders.
[129:10.97]No, that's over there.
[129:11.77]The music's so good in this game.
[129:16.44]It is pretty good.
[129:18.82]What about this one?
[129:19.28]Where's this?
[129:19.66]It's all the way down here.
[129:26.53]Looks like a city to me.
[129:27.57]I'm just going to go in.
[129:30.35]Well, that's the Elder Council.
[129:34.78]I need to alt tab so I can scroll the chat down to be live, so it's not four to five minutes ago.
[129:40.54]But if I alt tab, the game will crash.
[129:45.19]What is it?
[129:47.35]No!
[129:47.91]I tried to click.
[129:49.29]It's space.
[129:49.93]Yes, I'm the city's arena gatekeeper, but I'm not on duty now.
[129:54.31]If you want to bet on a fight, see me at the arena between 9 a.m.
[129:57.72]and 9 p.m.
[130:01.13]Okay.
[130:01.97]If you need to get rid of something quickly, check out the copious coin purse.
[130:07.13]Thanks, Ben.
[130:08.73]Somebody said, hold R. Why?
[130:17.29]Oh, you can see my character's face.
[130:22.98]Horse armor.
[130:24.88]Let me just go sell some shit.
[130:26.18]The horse is free.
[130:29.38]Really?
[130:34.59]So it's just right here.

[131:27.71]Oh, I took the book.
[131:28.73]Whatever.
[131:34.08]Who has the horse?
[131:35.56]You can't sleep in an unowned bed.
[131:37.00]Alright.
[132:04.45]Okay.
[132:09.33]Can you react to this five minutes from now?
[132:11.27]Alright, hold on a second.
[132:16.73]I need to do this, because... Let me just save it right here.
[132:21.74]It's a new save.
[132:23.40]I have to quit the game, because I have to go over here and... Oh hey, now I can see what you're writing in real time.
[132:28.88]That's so irritating.
[132:36.60]There we go, okay.
[132:37.56]Now I can see the messages finally.
[132:41.48]Just remind me never to scroll the mouse this entire game.
[132:46.65]Because it'll scroll on my other monitor.
[132:51.23]Okay.
[132:53.85]Yeah, let's go.
[133:02.86]Don't tell him.
[133:04.24]Don't tell me what.

[133:56.85]I'm overburdened.
[134:01.36]Oh, fuck off.
[134:05.50]Curious.

[136:31.66]So?
[136:34.79]In each attempt to persuade, you must admire, boast, joke, or coerce.
[136:38.47]Each of these actions raises or lowers the NPC's disposition.
[136:41.19]Don't take too long, because the NPC is steadily... As you highlight each possible action, the NPC's face shows his reaction to it.
[136:50.44]He will love, like, dislike, or hate each action.
[136:53.34]His disposition goes up if you select a loved or liked action, and goes down if you select one that's... Based on your speechcraft and how full the wedge is...
[137:04.00]Try to select fuller wedges when they are aligned with actions... Okay.
[137:11.11]Try to select fuller wedges when they are aligned with actions the NPC likes.
[137:14.85]Try to select less full wedges when they are aligned with actions he doesn't like.
[137:20.71]Bribe 11 GP for 11 bonus.

[149:27.83]Alright, let's go.
[149:33.91]Up the mountain.

[149:39.63]I know.
[149:41.85]I tried.
[149:46.31]I got the free DLC horse.
[149:48.59]It's all good.
[149:53.17]Does he have a fatigue meter?
[149:54.23]No.
[149:54.85]No.

[150:33.31]If you got to travel, please stay on the road.
[150:35.62]By the nine divines, stay on the road.
[150:38.70]So this isn't like GTA or Red Dead Redemption where I just go the straight line.
[150:43.56]Am I gonna get collapsed on?
[150:44.50]We're almost there.
[150:53.91]Yes, so I have to take the road or I'm gonna be in big trouble.
[151:03.04]I've arrived at Weyand and Prairie, now I must take the amulet to Joffrey.
[151:13.24]Alright, Joffrey.
[151:17.07]Come get it.
[151:18.15]There, he's in there.
[151:24.57]Joffrey?
[151:27.51]You Joffrey?
[151:28.89]No.
[151:31.60]Joffrey's probably inside.
[151:37.05]Incoming Game of Thrones joke.
[151:39.95]That's not true.
[151:43.23]I will not make one Game of Thrones reference.
[151:44.85]Yes.
[151:46.03]Can I help you?
[151:46.97]I'd like to speak to Joffrey.
[151:48.71]He's upstairs.
[151:49.87]Go ahead.
[151:50.55]Thank you, Fry Tuck.
[151:51.64]Appreciate it.
[151:53.92]Joffrey!
[151:54.20]Joffrey!
[152:06.33]Hold on, can I?
[152:07.97]What happens if I do that?
[152:09.51]Can I take the book out of his hand?
[152:18.11]Keep your fingers to yourself, you treacherous little filter.
[152:21.46]How dare you steal from me?
[152:25.56]He forgot another book.
[152:30.76]Can I give it back?
[152:48.99]Can I take the table?
[153:11.77]I'm sure I could take this seat underneath his back.
[153:19.70]I gotta stop doing this.
[153:20.57]I don't want to be on his bad side.
[153:22.79]I don't want to do that again.
[153:25.93]I'm loading.
[153:26.21]Alright, I have the amulet.
[153:30.93]Here you go.
[153:32.01]I brought you the Amulet of Kings!
[153:33.15]Should I?
[153:46.18]By the nine?
[153:47.76]This is the Amulet of Kings.
[153:50.50]Who are you?
[153:51.64]How did you get this?
[153:53.42]What do you know of the Emperor's death?
[153:57.16]Tell the Emperor's last words.
[153:58.54]As unlikely as your story sounds, I believe you.
[154:02.02]Only the strange destiny of Uriel Septim could have brought you to me carrying the Amulet of Kings.
[154:07.26]Am I going to get paid for this?
[154:11.51]Close shut the jaws of oblivion.
[154:12.97]His meaning is unclear to me as well.
[154:15.65]The Emperor seemed to perceive some threat from the demonic world of Oblivion.
[154:20.31]The Prince of Destruction, Mehrunes Dagon, is one of the Lords of Oblivion.
[154:25.29]But the mortal world is protected from the Daedra of Oblivion by magical barriers.
[154:30.82]How can Oblivion threaten us?
[154:32.02]We're so powerful.
[154:33.28]Only the Emperors truly understand the meaning behind the rituals of coronation.
[154:38.28]The Amulet of Kings is ancient.
[154:40.60]Saint Alicia herself received it from the gods.
[154:43.72]It is a holy relic of great power.
[154:47.02]When an Emperor is crowned, he uses the amulet to light the Dragonfires at the Temple of the One in the Imperial City.
[154:54.32]With the Emperor dead and no new heir crowned, the Dragonfires in the Temple will be dark for the first time in centuries.
[155:02.41]It may be that the Dragonfires protected us from a threat that only the Emperor was aware of.
[155:07.81]Did I fast travel?
[155:08.61]No, I ran all the way there on a horse.
[155:11.13]I am one of the few who know of his existence.
[155:14.32]Many years ago, I served as captain of Uriel's bodyguards, the Blades.
[155:19.40]One night, Uriel called me into his private chambers.
[155:22.60]A baby boy lay sleeping.
[155:24.40]He never told me anything else about the baby, but I knew it was his son.
[155:29.04]From time to time, he would ask, now it seems that this illegitimate son is the...
[155:35.93]Where can I find him?
[155:37.11]That was the same audio clip, back to back.
[155:38.61]Somebody clip that.
[155:39.27]That was the exact same audio clip, but I did that twice in a row.
[155:41.90]I can't click it though, just you'll look at it, you'll see.
[156:04.31]Uh, assistants, uh, dragonflies, elder council... The Blades, I guess.
[156:11.83]Yes, Boros told you right.
[156:14.35]I am the Grand Master of the Blades.
[156:16.93]We serve the Emperor and the Septim bloodline.
[156:19.67]Talos is our patron.
[156:22.21]You wonder to find me here?
[156:24.67]discretion is our watchword only a few of us have the honor to serve publicly in the imperial thanks for the info waste no time you must find Martin before the enemy does alright find Martin I can do that
[156:49.56]Find Martin.
[156:50.82]Joffrey told me that the emperor has an illegitimate son named Martin who is currently serving as a priest in the chapel of Akatosh in the city of Kvatch.
[156:59.70]I must proceed to Kvatch at once and bring Martin safely.
[157:07.20]Damn it.
[157:09.80]That looks far away.
[157:13.53]That's really far away.
[157:14.67]I don't even know where I am.
[157:27.99]am I?
[157:29.71]Is there a zoom?
[157:30.47]Alright, I'm right here.
[157:34.16]How do I zoom in and out?
[157:44.66]No fast travel.
[157:45.68]I'm not going to fast travel.
[157:46.75]I'm going to travel very quickly with the UI.
[157:51.43]Alright, so we got shrooms here.
[158:00.33]Alright.
[158:02.13]Let me... Let's take a look.
[158:03.85]So I need to go... There.
[158:07.24]That's not that far.
[158:09.46]We got something to do right here, too.
[158:13.16]Alright.
[158:13.54]Let's do... Let's go through here.
[158:16.54]Let's track that quest.
[158:18.28]Where is it?
[158:20.74]The one that's right on the way there.
[158:22.28]The bandits?
[158:23.06]Where the hell is it?
[158:26.52]Bandits, bandits, bandits, bandits, bandits.
[158:28.12]There it is.
[158:30.56]Let's track this right now.
[158:31.48]I'm just going to go right to it.
[158:41.96]Castle portal, north gate, south gate.
[158:44.30]Was there something else I could do here?
[158:46.33]Ayayayayayayayayayayay.
[158:57.91]Alright, let's go.
[159:00.19]I'm the shepherd here.
[159:01.27]Oh, hey, shepherd.
[159:05.21]Erinor is the name.
[159:08.01]And this is Wainon Priory.
[159:10.55]Yes?
[159:28.86]Thank you.
[159:30.34]I like that.
[159:32.16]Is that so?
[159:34.85]Blah, blah, blah.
[159:35.97]What a bore.
[159:39.27]Oh, that's great.
[159:40.97]That's really too much.
[159:42.97]It's good of you to say so.
[159:45.05]You're pathetic.
[159:46.25]What?
[159:47.43]You're wasting your breath.
[159:53.63]I like you, too.
[159:56.61]That's really funny.
[159:59.83]Is that so?
[160:02.16]You're a big, fat liar.
[160:04.40]Alright, admire.
[160:06.98]You're too kind.
[160:07.98]Joke.
[160:08.84]That's really funny.
[160:10.46]Boast.
[160:11.36]You're pathetic.
[160:13.52]You're wasting your breath.
[160:16.41]Where'd you get that?
[160:18.11]That's good.
[160:18.99]Thank you.
[160:25.09]You're wasting your... You're full of it.
[160:28.18]That's really funny.
[160:31.08]You're full of it.
[160:32.76]It's good of you to say so.
[160:34.84]Is that so?
[160:35.82]Got it.
[160:36.64]I don't know.
[160:38.91]Look at the face.
[160:39.69]The face has... His face... Look at his face.
[160:43.61]His face has the same half animation.
[160:57.84]It's trial or standard default I'm going the wrong way Every person you come in contact with left upset good and soon he'll be bowing

[162:05.18]You're okay.
[162:19.10]What's up here?
[162:20.58]Bad guys?
[162:23.61]Music changed.
[162:24.19]There is a... There's a wolf here, though.
[162:30.33]Who's faster, wolf or horse?
[162:32.62]But get it on Spike TV, we'll find out.
[162:42.38]The horse is slower than walking.
[162:45.68]It kind of feels that way, I'm not gonna lie.
[162:47.40]Alright, we're good.
[162:55.36]We have to be getting close.
[163:02.34]How close are we?
[163:03.04]I just don't know where I even am.
[163:15.21]I'm, like, kind of far away.
[163:17.19]I'm kind of far away.
[163:19.27]I wonder... I can't fast travel here, though.
[163:30.12]You can do it.
[163:30.58]Come on.
[163:40.71]Alright, we're good.
[163:42.18]Nice and slick.
[163:51.64]Mancers.
[163:52.43]Yeah.
[163:56.33]A thousand and one ways to die.
[164:01.99]Somebody got sucked in through the penis hole of the jacuzzi.
[164:05.18]Can you believe it?
[164:18.79]I think this might be the worst way I could have possibly gone.
[164:25.96]Well, I got to the top.
[164:26.56]Everyone wanted me to go on the mountain.
[164:27.74]We're at the top.
[164:32.79]Easy.
[164:33.45]I don't want to ghost ride the horse off the mountain.
[164:35.85]That would be bad.
[164:48.75]Is it, like, right here?
[164:51.93]Where even is this?
[165:05.28]No, no, no, no.
[165:05.82]Get on the horse.
[165:14.14]Quick save.
[165:14.66]You're making me nervous.
[165:15.66]I'm good.
[165:15.94]I saved it.
[165:17.16]We're good.
[165:20.82]I'll take it slow.
[165:29.60]Almost there.
[165:31.58]F5.
[165:31.66]That's good to know.
[165:32.66]Thanks, guys.
[165:40.39]Make more Green Day jokes.
[165:44.79]There's no opportunity.
[165:50.10]I'm getting close.
[165:51.26]We're almost there.
[165:53.74]Don't jump like that.
[166:06.53]Make more opportunities.
[166:09.98]Well, we have to fight a monster.
[166:22.47]Is that a rat?
[166:24.47]What is a rat doing here?
[166:28.11]That's a very odd place for a giant rat to be, is right here.
[166:30.83]Alright, this is here.
[166:35.56]Just press F5.
[166:36.56]That's a dog.
[166:48.18]The monster is me.
[166:50.81]Is it, though?
[166:51.99]I don't think it is.
[166:54.21]I'm a pretty well-behaved person.
[166:55.77]Monsters are not well-behaved.
[166:59.96]Rats live in the wild.
[167:01.02]Oh, don't you know?
[167:03.46]Rats only live in major city or inside of a sewer.
[167:08.31]What happened to me?
[167:19.73]Did I step on a fucking landmine?
[167:21.17]What happened?
[167:30.53]What?
[167:40.10]The horse crushed you when it died.
[167:41.60]Um... Yeah, how, uh... How, if I'm on top of the horse?
[167:57.68]I'm going to go down this way.
[167:58.84]Alright, this time just be careful.
[168:05.68]Apparently you can just slip down and die.
[168:08.00]Alright, save it.
[168:13.79]F5.
[168:14.99]Got it.
[168:18.83]Here is the camp.
[168:19.49]I'm going to leave my horse here.
[168:33.17]Where are they?
[168:49.19]I just... You guys wanted me to turn the grass up.
[168:51.45]This is why I wanted to turn the grass down.
[168:58.61]Ugh.
[169:08.77]Where did you get this magical fucking health from?
[169:25.34]Did you heal?
[169:26.79]Alright, uh...
[169:49.37]I'm gonna lose.
[169:49.79]You're dead.
[169:51.11]So, what's this about?
[170:19.84]I got $100.
[170:20.28]Hold on.
[170:21.82]Gornhole.
[170:22.46]Thank you for the $100.
[170:25.38]I saw... I just barely saw what you said.
[170:28.40]I can't alt-tab right now, but you said, I have trouble saying penishole, but not... I won't say... I said that backwards.
[170:37.98]I don't have trouble saying penishole.
[170:40.88]I said it backwards again.
[170:42.60]I have no problem saying penishole, but I can't say gornhole.
[170:51.47]This is what the first part of the message said.
[170:54.39]Uh, that's true.
[170:55.89]You are correct.
[171:01.19]I don't know, but Gornhole just sounded really bad.
[171:04.85]Like, and gross.
[171:07.37]But I looked up the word.
[171:08.27]It's a, uh... It's a process to shuck corn.
[171:15.66]But anyways, thank you so much, dude.
[171:16.68]Thanks for the $100.
[171:18.36]It's a lot of fucking money.
[171:21.87]While I sit here and figure out if I have made the worst possible character I ever could have made.
[171:26.41]They're gonna kill the horse, aren't they?
[171:32.60]I'll make a penis hole.
[171:36.28]Do I have any fucking healing potions?
[171:44.85]I don't think I even have a healing potion.
[171:57.23]You're level 1 in a level 50 area?
[172:00.27]That's not true, is it?
[172:01.31]Are you serious?
[172:05.41]You can't... Are you serious?
[172:10.66]That can't be real.
[172:19.44]okay um why am I getting my ass kicked heal wounds because my character is awful because you're level one trying to do DLC well I'm doing I'm alright

[173:36.82]Technically?
[173:40.42]Okay, I am now.
[173:44.66]For Helmet.
[173:48.48]No, we're not doing mods tonight.
[173:49.88]We're just enjoying the experience tonight.
[173:53.55]We'll see where we are.
[173:54.47]Ooh!
[173:54.97]Ooh!
[173:57.54]What?
[173:57.70]Axes are good too for my character, aren't they?
[174:00.82]I'm gonna try it.
[174:01.60]It's a little bit lighter.
[174:02.20]Alright, that's fine.
[174:26.17]Cool.
[174:27.21]So that's... This camp is done.
[174:30.05]Technically, right?
[174:34.22]So let me get this straight.
[174:36.90]Is there a way for me to tell what level this stuff is?
[174:41.96]Or do I just kind of have to figure that out?
[174:46.73]So I'm just going to do the thing that I'm supposed to do.
[174:50.07]Which is continue to go down from here.
[174:54.70]So we're just going to track this.
[174:55.70]It's right below me here.
[174:56.70]Alright, let's go.
[175:01.22]Was there anything else at this camp?
[175:11.75]Oh no, no, no, no, no.
[175:12.81]I didn't save it.
[175:13.43]Save it.
[175:13.75]F5 is fast.
[175:18.52]Everything is scaled.
[175:23.17]But you need to level.
[175:24.37]Okay.
[175:32.70]It's recommended levels, but the game scales with you.
[175:36.00]Okay.
[175:36.94]That's good to know.
[175:38.66]Can I heal the horse?
[175:40.89]Is there a way I can do that?
[175:43.09]Is there a forge down here?
[175:44.09]What's this?
[175:47.17]Shattered mine.
[175:48.05]I don't got time for this right now.
[175:55.13]There's a spell, okay.
[176:02.19]Use a healing spell?
[176:03.11]I don't know if I have one that can target people.
[176:08.06]Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, don't do it.
[176:13.96]Items are also leveled.
[176:17.48]You know what I'll probably do after the stream tonight?
[176:18.82]I mean, we were just kind of dicking around for a few hours here.
[176:22.84]I'm probably gonna just like, I'm gonna like do, I'm gonna go to oblivion.com or whatever the fuck it is, the wiki.
[176:28.28]I'm just gonna read a bunch of stuff.
[176:31.24]Why not just fast travel?
[176:32.44]Because chat told me that if I fast travel in the first hour that I'm a loser.
[176:39.58]That's what I was told.
[176:54.49]Come on, you can do it.
[177:04.13]Okay, we're good.
[177:04.99]So, if I have to go here... Never fast travel.
[177:09.91]I have to.
[177:11.87]I can't just ride straight.
[177:14.99]Alright, where's the entrance?
[177:18.69]Inside.
[177:23.77]Oblivion.com redirects to an amusement park page?
[177:31.24]Why would Oblivion redirect to an amusement park?
[177:41.19]Rest with tea for horse to heal.
[177:43.59]Oh, okay.
[177:48.11]If I hit tea, is that magician and his goblin friend going to show up again?
[177:52.95]Yeah, I'm like afraid that that's gonna happen.
[177:56.18]Oh god.
[177:59.41]Can you get struck by lightning in this game?
[178:00.63]I hope not.
[178:29.20]Am I supposed to be here?
[178:30.12]I found a gate to Oblivion.
[178:33.20]Do I have to go in the gate?
[178:45.62]Go in?
[178:46.02]Why am I not going in?
[178:47.22]Is that...
[179:01.56]Are these bad guys?
[179:05.62]What's in my hand?
[179:07.50]No, I don't want the hammer.
[179:09.65]Pick the hammer up!
[179:12.15]Put on the hammer!
[179:15.27]I can't scroll.
[179:16.87]Why is the chat just going up?
[179:21.05]Oh my fucking god, I can't even scroll.
[179:24.61]The game thinks I'm in a different window or something.
[179:33.26]I'm scrolling the chat up and down right now.
[179:38.33]Oh, fucking lord.
[179:39.83]Give me a break.
[179:47.79]Thank the Nine.
[179:49.16]I never thought I'd see another friendly face.
[179:51.96]The others?
[179:53.48]Taken.
[179:54.78]They were taken to the tower.
[179:58.17]Captain Matias sent us in to try and close the gate.
[180:01.43]We were ambushed, trapped.
[180:03.19]Drink.
[180:03.63]Got it.
[180:05.65]I managed to escape, but the others are strewn across that bridge.
[180:09.21]They took many and off to the big tower.
[180:11.10]You've got to save him.
[180:12.48]I'll try.
[180:13.10]I'm getting out of here.
[180:15.60]Fine, Captain.
[180:16.26]I need your help.
[180:16.96]Hold on.
[180:17.32]I can use your help.
[180:18.12]You're right.
[180:20.06]You're right.
[180:22.15]You can help me do all the stuff.
[180:27.17]Rebind the scroll wheel?
[180:34.26]Let's go find the minions.
[180:39.20]After you.
[180:39.56]Let me just make sure I have all my cool stuff equipped.
[180:43.71]So, I got Potion of Respite, Potion of Illness, Damage Health, 10 points.
[180:47.67]Why would I drink that?
[180:50.71]Uh, I... Why did I pick that fucking stupid thing?
[180:57.17]Alright, are you ready?
[180:58.57]I'm ready.
[180:59.81]We have to go... Look at his face.
[181:04.12]He's like, I'm ready.
[181:07.40]So, am I going to go through here, or where?
[181:10.22]Do I have to go back through the gate?
[181:15.46]I love the lizard face so much.
[181:20.34]Picks alchemy as skill.
[181:21.56]Okay, I gotta get the axe.
[181:31.71]Do I need to close the gate?
[181:33.65]Do I need to, uh... No, we just have to go this way, right?
[181:42.24]I mean, why would...
[181:53.01]Change the quest.
[181:53.85]Do I just pick a random quest or something?
[182:00.15]Oh, I got a... Punch the gate.
[182:11.44]I... I'm just gonna kill this thing.
[182:13.22]Now it's my turn, you bastard!
[182:23.93]I think I hit him in the head accidentally.
[182:26.65]We're not a good team.
[182:30.92]We're not a good team.
[182:32.22]We're a bad team.
[182:36.78]I have to assume it's like up here.
[182:44.25]Alright, go.
[182:54.82]over there watch out don't get baited here he's almost dead did the fov change again god damn it I was wondering why I felt like sick playing this for a second
[183:33.79]Change to the new quest and it'll give you a marker.
[183:41.07]Okay.
[183:42.27]Now, there we go.
[183:43.15]That's better.
[183:44.80]I was gonna say, what's another one?
[183:49.00]Where?
[183:50.30]Where is it?
[183:50.58]Up here?
[183:51.02]I don't see anything.
[183:51.52]Are you looking at the stone?
[183:53.74]Is it a flying monster or something he sees?
[184:05.33]Hey.
[184:08.47]I hit him too hard in the head.
[184:09.71]Well, he's lost over there.
[184:13.79]Get over here.
[184:14.35]I need your help.
[184:14.93]You need to kill things for me.
[184:22.07]Did I scramble this guy's brains?
[184:23.24]I just got scared.
[184:29.48]Oh, it's that hit me.
[184:31.34]Oh, fuck this guy.
[184:32.22]Whatever.
[184:39.08]He's just back there swinging at nothing.
[184:47.06]What was that?
[184:51.88]He's probably gone.
[184:55.08]I reduced his intelligence to zero.
[184:58.86]Whoopsie.
[185:04.32]Alright, well that was an explosion.
[185:07.24]That was that mine I was talking about so much.
[185:11.71]I'm dead.
[185:13.47]I'm dead.
[185:17.15]I just exploded.
[185:18.27]I'm dead.
[185:26.60]Oh, it's that guy.
[185:28.58]That's the dude he's seeing.
[185:29.70]We have to get rid of him.
[185:38.31]Jesus.
[185:45.38]Just love how the difficulty of my build is wank.
[185:49.80]I'm getting hit once.
[185:51.90]I can't even hurt anybody.
[185:55.24]Who told me to do this?
[185:56.39]Who said this was a good idea?
[186:10.08]Goblin.
[186:21.01]You decided your attributes with Green Day.
[186:33.28]You know, you have a point.
[186:34.56]But... I can't... I can't physically... I don't think I can physically go on.
[186:41.08]If I can't even hurt a fucking goblin.
[186:45.48]You know what I'm saying?
[186:46.38]Look at this shit.
[186:55.59]I have to hit this guy like 40 times.
[187:01.53]Lower the difficulty.
[187:04.85]It's already...
[187:22.12]This is embarrassing What an embarrassment There are people that stream this game and their title says something along the lines of Playing Oblivion at max difficulty with one hit and you die I'm just gonna put it down to the easy setting because I can't hurt anything
[187:51.33]I'm gonna die again.
[187:55.89]Should I not have picked my skills with Green Day?
[188:11.91]I'm gonna die to this guy.
[188:12.91]He's gonna be one time.
[188:15.53]I did the same thing during New Vegas.
[188:17.99]I can't be helped.
[188:25.43]Okay, he's dead.
[188:26.39]Does this guy have a heal?
[188:29.66]Where is he?
[188:30.44]Is he alive down here?
[188:33.20]Where's my friend?
[188:41.18]You cannot rest.
[188:43.34]Somebody said just rest.
[188:44.55]Hold on.
[188:44.85]Let me stealth kill this guy.
[188:51.69]Why were you turning?
[188:52.63]Why would you turn around?
[188:53.81]Can they hear me fucking walking?
[188:57.19]Even crouching?
[189:11.09]Caps lock is moving slower.
[189:14.03]Oh, god damn.
[189:15.89]Okay, well, I don't want to move slow now.
[189:24.28]I can actually hurt things.
[189:33.23]The panic.
[189:34.41]The panic swing.
[189:36.69]Rest?
[189:37.83]I can't rest until all the enemies are dead.
[189:39.99]I'm going to stealth kill this guy.
[190:00.85]Okay, now I'm gonna stealth kill this guy.
[190:17.05]Am I gonna get to do that once this whole game?
[190:23.31]Okay.
[190:28.63]This guy beat Dark Souls?
[190:30.77]I did.
[190:31.07]I did.
[190:32.64]I also beat Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1.
[190:35.92]And all the DLC.
[190:37.22]And I didn't summon anybody.
[190:39.18]That's what you got.
[190:42.21]Where is this?
[190:42.65]Up there?
[190:44.11]Is he actually gone?
[190:49.09]Okay, rest.
[190:56.00]That guy's just gone.
[190:57.42]He doesn't exist.
[190:59.08]By the way, I think resting makes my FOV go back.
[191:01.94]It does.
[191:03.98]That's what the problem was.
[191:18.71]He's dead.
[191:19.31]Find his body and loot it.
[191:20.41]That's too late.
[191:24.89]I don't deserve it.
[191:29.80]Because your eyes are blurry when you wake up.
[191:31.37]Yeah, you have to rub your eyes.
[191:40.43]I'm gonna get this.
[191:41.07]Does he turn around?
[191:50.12]Is...
[192:06.85]Alright.
[192:09.58]Okay, I think I can turn the difficulty back up.
[192:38.18]I don't think that's a... I don't think that skill works in the game.
[192:48.89]Use the bow?
[192:49.43]No, I gotta be two-hander.
[192:56.91]Oh shit, this is a new guy.
[193:05.33]That'll get out of my life.
[193:07.85]Good comeback.
[193:09.69]Get out of my life.
[193:11.11]I can trade with this guy?
[193:16.11]Oh, I know.
[193:16.39]I can put stuff on him.
[193:22.05]Okay, hold on a minute.
[193:24.29]Starlight.
[193:24.93]Lift 20 feet for safety.
[193:26.21]Blink invisibility for 5 seconds.
[193:27.61]I want to try this.
[193:31.17]I'll get my sneak attack.
[193:32.15]Just you wait.
[194:03.06]It didn't work.
[194:06.80]Oh well.
[194:12.68]Where'd he go?
[194:13.44]He even turns around.
[194:25.14]He even... No, I want to heal.
[194:29.77]He even turns around.
[194:34.47]Did he drop a weapon?
[194:37.85]Ooh.
[194:38.41]Holy fuck.
[194:40.27]Give me that.
[194:43.05]Oh.
[194:44.09]Boy.
[194:46.35]Four damage.
[194:47.25]Oh, and I can have a shield on, too?
[194:49.18]And a staff?
[194:49.78]Thank the Lord.
[194:59.48]Okay.
[195:00.74]Now we can be good about this, and I can go here.
[195:05.70]We just had to get a little bit of a handicap for just a second.
[195:08.54]Right?
[195:09.40]Just enough.
[195:16.14]Alright, let's go.
[195:20.10]Blood Fountain.
[195:31.27]The difficulty slider is really vague.
[195:33.13]It is.
[195:35.77]Do you want your difficulty to be more to the right, or... What am I looking for exactly here?
[195:46.91]I'm looking for... Okay.
[195:47.71]So, this is where I came in.
[196:21.43]Keep going up.
[196:22.03]I feel like I want a torch.
[196:30.92]Yeah, we are very close.
[196:32.28]Almost to the end of the game.
[196:36.96]You close the Oblivion Gate and that's it.
[196:55.78]It's actually kind of funny just how a quarter of an inch from here to the left is I can kill enemies in three hits.
[197:07.13]Whoa!
[197:22.88]The power of an extra inch.
[197:27.49]Right through here.
[197:30.19]Ooh.
[197:43.06]Oh, he jumped off.
[197:45.38]Streaming, it's funny.
[197:48.36]What's that video on YouTube that you just... Why you just fell off?
[198:04.36]Where?
[198:06.26]Where are you, man?
[198:11.78]Boss fight, boss fight, boss fight.
[198:37.58]You must get to the top of the large tower the sigil keep they call it that's what keeps the oblivion gate open Find the sigil stone remove it and the gate will close the keeper has to keep you must get the key
[199:09.72]Gatekeeper!
[199:11.36]Got it!
[199:12.04]I have the key to the keep!
[199:13.66]I must reach the sigil stone and remove it from the sigil keep to close the Oblivion Gate to the Necrozit.
[199:29.83]Now where's that?
[199:32.23]Over here?
[199:38.32]Pick up his weapon.
[199:39.34]Oh, he dropped a weapon.
[199:46.26]Ooh, look at that.
[199:47.62]It's the same thing I have on, isn't it?
[199:49.10]Yep, yep.
[199:52.57]Oh no, this one's better.
[200:07.98]Okay, that's fine.
[200:11.52]Portal to... I swear, that's gonna drive me nuts.
[200:20.07]Somebody said to go in the INI file.
[200:27.35]Enemies nearby.
[200:28.03]I can't just sleep out on the rafters?
[200:39.61]It's not that.
[200:41.11]It's not over there.
[200:42.45]Needs a key.
[200:43.23]Open the special door with a special key.
[200:56.05]Holy shit.
[200:58.37]Okay, I don't... That was close.
[201:00.75]I didn't need... Perfect opportunity.
[201:02.27]Here it is.
[201:14.92]I'm dead.
[201:16.74]Do I have potion or anything?
[201:19.76]No, I don't.
[201:21.72]Any of these heal?
[201:23.54]Restore fatigue.
[201:25.22]Just eat the fucking onion.
[201:26.10]Eat the garlic.
[201:31.34]Nothing.
[201:31.82]Damage health.
[201:32.46]I don't want to drink that.
[201:37.24]There it is.
[201:44.34]Okay, I don't understand.
[201:45.86]I don't understand.
[201:47.76]Oh, I get it now.
[201:48.34]I understand.
[201:53.09]Well, that was a waste.
[201:56.75]I guess my brain just doesn't know that you can just stand still and heal.
[202:00.75]Just wait an hour.
[202:11.55]Is he going to activate this?
[202:22.85]They're everywhere.
[202:23.77]Okay, I'm fine.
[202:33.30]Here, heal yourself with this one weird trick.
[202:38.41]Am I on the wrong way here?
[202:41.27]Did I just went the wrong way?
[202:50.59]Door to Meat Harbor.
[202:52.87]That's not correct.
[203:11.65]I'm so good at it, it didn't even touch me.
[203:18.19]Sounds like a restaurant.
[203:19.93]Sounds like a pretty shitty restaurant.
[203:23.13]There we go.
[203:25.05]Blood Feast.
[203:32.20]Okay, stand on the podium.
[203:35.04]And drink blood.
[203:48.98]Who's this bad guy?
[203:49.98]What is this thing?
[203:51.23]It's a person.
[203:53.11]I thought there was a guy with like funny legs like a Monster Hunter monster Darth Maul Okay, nice
[204:12.56]Gold.
[204:13.78]I thought that was leg, leg, head.
[204:19.06]Where are you?
[204:26.73]Shit, he just stunned me.
[204:28.03]Carry me.
[204:46.68]What about us?
[204:47.02]Do we have a weapon?
[204:50.52]Same thing, they might be better, because at this point I'm breaking these down.
[204:53.59]Yeah, it is better.
[204:56.99]Why does it keep losing durability?
[205:03.47]Can't wait.
[205:13.02]Flesh pods are chests made out of a person that's still alive.
[205:19.50]That's pretty horrifying.
[205:23.66]Can Jerma reach level 2 before the stream ends?
[205:34.47]Don't make me laugh.
[205:36.19]Don't make me laugh.
[205:38.51]You made me laugh.
[205:51.60]I'm serious.
[205:53.18]Asshole.
[205:53.82]God damn it.
[205:54.68]I think I just fucking saved it.
[206:11.45]Why don't we play a love-making simulator?
[206:14.89]What is a love-making simulator?
[206:16.50]What the hell is that?
[206:20.44]Let me try this again.
[206:28.59]I've tried- I've tried to spam and it didn't do anything.
[206:37.33]Leisure suit Larry.
[206:39.43]Where's the weird mushroom thing?
[206:45.04]Heart.
[206:54.62]I'm not supposed to be fighting him?
[206:58.24]I have to kill him, though.
[207:00.64]I have to.
[207:01.08]If I lose here again, I'll turn the difficulty and I'll sit in the corner in shame.
[207:09.19]Wait, hold on.
[207:09.71]Perfect.
[207:10.01]Come on.
[207:11.79]Is he looking over here?
[207:12.47]Yeah, is he?
[207:13.77]No, he's not.
[207:16.11]Is his back turned?
[207:18.81]I can't tell if his back... No, his back is not turned.
[207:22.98]I think this guy's currently waiting right now.
[207:24.67]Like two hours.
[207:44.68]Snuck attack.
[207:46.01]Sneak attack.
[207:46.73]Got it.
[207:55.27]We're good.
[208:08.50]Oh wait, his weapon.
[208:15.00]I keep thinking the weapon's going to be on his body.
[208:16.78]What the hell is it?
[208:23.58]Where's the weapon?
[208:25.22]Is he lying on top of it?
[208:38.48]You can drag people?
[209:05.84]This weapon's not even here.
[209:11.70]Is it blending with the ground somewhere?
[209:13.27]I don't see it anywhere.
[209:16.99]It's right there.
[209:17.91]It's right there.
[209:18.61]No, it's not.
[209:20.13]Where?
[209:21.19]Ah, there it is.
[209:23.49]Level four.
[209:25.12]Yes, I'll take it and I'll just put it on.
[209:26.90]No, actually not yet.
[209:30.98]Well, now I have to throw this down.
[209:32.32]I can sell this for a lot of money, though.
[209:34.64]Now I'll throw the... What the fuck is this shit?
[209:37.76]Sell the dumb goblin staff.
[209:41.80]Are these broken?
[209:42.34]Yeah.
[209:43.72]Fuck it.
[209:43.98]Throw them.
[209:46.52]Fuck it.
[209:47.14]Fuck it.
[209:47.82]Yeah, fuck it.
[209:51.31]Fuck this stuff.
[209:57.61]Fuck this.
[209:58.17]This stuff weighs way too much.
[210:03.52]I have to get rid of one of these.
[210:04.60]Which one sells for more?
[210:05.50]I think this one does.
[210:07.94]I have to.
[210:09.42]Alright.
[210:15.14]Let's go.
[210:27.35]Alright.
[210:27.75]Blood fountain?
[210:29.03]Sure, I'll take it.
[210:30.47]That's healing.
[210:32.59]Kind of unnecessary, but... What do I have to do about this?
[210:37.49]Up top?
[210:41.75]This is an interesting room.
[210:47.82]Do I have to give a speech from up here or something?
[210:54.96]Mana fountain.
[210:57.96]Um, hi.
[210:59.88]Alright.
[211:06.93]I'm over-encumbered again.
[211:15.45]Just get rid of the least good one, right?
[211:18.24]Every time.
[211:24.08]Pretty soul gem.
[211:35.59]I don't have any cups or anything.
[211:40.53]You mean the most bad one?
[211:41.81]That is what I'm trying to say.
[211:55.70]Well, that's how you lose.
[212:08.46]Jesus fucking Christ.
[212:14.14]Where even is this?
[212:14.92]I don't wanna take that.
[212:23.96]There's no reason to.
[212:27.33]That's all I get from this?
[212:35.25]I have one potion.
[212:41.24]Believe I only have let's see what's here.
[212:45.64]I Have weak potion of healing which can go in slot number three Slot for I believe it might be the same thing Just stop dying Well, it's not so easy I
[213:12.02]Gonna kill these guys again.
[213:13.12]That's irritating Harry keep casting spells at me.
[213:24.29]Please fill my entire meter How to live just don't die I
[213:46.70]Where did he... Okay, he's gone.
[213:52.02]Potion of Cure Poison.
[213:53.34]Potion of Night Eye.
[213:56.46]Very cool.
[213:59.03]What was the weapon he had?
[214:00.23]It's... It's gone.
[214:08.99]Ah, when he dies, he summons.
[214:10.11]He just dies.
[214:15.63]Destroy the orb.
[214:18.10]I'm assuming, right?
[214:19.50]Weak Potion of Healing.
[214:20.86]I used to have those, now.
[214:24.70]Uh-oh.
[214:26.18]Am I supposed to do that?
[214:42.85]I guess so.
[214:45.68]I've closed the gate by taking the sigil stone that anchors it within Oblivion.
[214:49.79]I should tell Salvian Mattius that the way into Kvatch is now open.
[214:56.29]Well, there's my horse.
[215:00.43]Hey.
[215:07.57]Die, you scumbag!
[215:16.56]I skipped too much lore?
[215:19.76]How?
[215:23.01]Alright.
[215:25.37]I've closed the gate.
[215:28.11]Now I must reach the sigil stone and remove it from the sigil... I already did that.
[215:44.60]I left those two people to die?
[215:45.80]I mean, I didn't.
[215:47.40]They just didn't live.
[215:49.93]Oh, here we go.
[215:50.47]Hi, guys.
[215:51.49]I did it.
[215:54.01]Guy in the cage?
[215:54.67]Well, I punched him.
[215:55.63]Should be alive.
[215:56.23]I just was in there.
[215:56.95]I don't want to do it again.
[216:10.63]I just did that!
[216:11.31]I'm... I guess I'm ready.
[216:12.85]Breaking the siege.
[216:37.58]I guess we're just going in.
[216:39.28]Now I have to take the city.
[216:41.33]Oh, okay.
[216:51.77]I invented the ruined city of Thatch with the Salvian Matthias and his men.
[216:55.71]We must clear the southern plaza before the survivors in the chapel can be rescued.
[217:00.41]Alright, let's get it.
[217:12.30]We need gold.
[217:13.96]If somebody dies here, does that whole mission end?
[217:17.16]Dead.
[217:28.53]Uh, four.
[217:29.45]This one has poison.
[217:33.54]Shit, I'm over-encumbered.
[217:35.68]Maybe I should get rid of one of these.
[217:37.12]Put on the poison one.
[217:37.86]Get rid of this.
[217:38.36]199.
[217:38.94]We're good.
[217:44.78]I've helped him, and his men retake the southern plaza.
[217:46.76]I should talk to him about the next move.
[217:57.14]Come here, come here, come here, come here.
[217:58.56]Why am I walking, why am I going so slow?
[218:05.36]This is the first 20 minutes of the game.
[218:07.40]Wait, don't you mean the first four hours?
[218:09.16]Caps lock?
[218:09.50]No, that's walking.
[218:10.36]Now I'm running.
[218:10.72]I have too many maces shoved up my ass?
[218:11.79]Probably.
[218:41.22]For normal people, it's the first 20 minutes.
[218:43.06]Well, we were like dicking around and running around looking at stuff.
[218:47.26]Sir, we're all that's left.
[218:49.68]Barrack Indian, myself, and these civilians.
[218:52.58]To play a game like this in the correct order is to play it incorrectly.
[218:55.88]There's no one else.
[218:57.14]I agree.
[218:58.00]There were others, sir, but they refused to stay put.
[219:01.52]We tried to convince them it was dangerous, but they left anyway.
[219:05.62]I guess they didn't make it.
[219:07.75]very well the area outside the chapel has been cleared and these people need to be taken to safety escort them to the camp south of here at once but sir I want to help fight sir once they're secure get back here immediately we'll need every available blade and there'll be plenty of fighting to go around your character looks like a stained glass window civilians it's time to move up let's go
[219:38.29]Kind of does.
[219:39.65]Alright, you.
[219:40.92]We've done it.
[219:42.96]I can't believe it.
[219:44.48]I didn't really think this would work.
[219:47.49]Maybe we do have a fighting chance.
[219:51.24]Oh, yes.
[219:52.16]We're not done.
[219:52.86]Not even close.
[219:54.20]This was only the first step.
[219:56.60]If this town is to be ours again, we'll need to get inside the castle.
[219:59.75]Depressed oils, Bill.
[220:01.55]You've come this far with us.
[220:04.19]Will you go further?
[220:06.05]If we're truly going to succeed, I'll need much more of your help.
[220:10.61]I warn you, though, what we've seen so far is nothing compared to the battle that likely awaits us.
[220:17.70]Take a few moments to catch your breath and think it over.
[220:20.00]That's all you're going to give me when you're ready?
[220:21.76]Let me know and we'll get underway.
[220:24.24]Look really happy about this.
[220:25.34]Alright, so I let's just we're here.
[220:27.88]Are you ready to go?
[220:29.32]We need your help.
[220:30.84]Let's go.
[220:32.50]Our goal is the castle gate.
[220:34.89]We should be able to use this door to get out to the plaza in front of the castle gatehouse.
[220:40.47]You know the drill.
[220:41.79]Stick close and keep your eyes open.
[220:44.27]Let's Jesus.
[220:48.94]It's the smell, really.
[220:51.18]Smoke and fire.
[220:57.69]Let's go!
[220:57.99]199 out of 200.
[220:59.71]Take crotch.
[221:02.35]Enemy.
[221:06.63]Enemy sighted.
[221:07.23]Enemy down.
[221:09.13]Nice.
[221:09.39]Enemy sighted.
[221:23.22]Take crotch?
[221:24.52]What does that mean?
[221:30.30]What does take crotch mean?
[221:33.00]Why am I walking?
[221:33.90]Uh, I'm not.
[221:35.18]I'm just one point away from being over encumbered.
[221:40.35]That smile.
[221:46.11]So let's go.
[221:47.39]What are you waiting for?
[221:49.59]Damn it.
[222:12.29]Okay, find Barrage.
[222:13.03]The call is coming from inside of the gatehouse.
[222:14.81]Alright, let me go pee.
[222:15.77]First of all, let's save it.
[222:16.65]I'm going to have to exit the game.
[222:18.35]Do your worst.
[222:44.74]Because I can't alt-tab.
[222:45.72]So, let me pee.
[222:48.96]I'll be right back.
[222:53.05]That's not true.
[222:54.93]That is, though.
[222:56.43]See you guys in, like, two minutes.
[225:29.18]Hello.
[225:32.08]Okay.
[225:32.82]Let's do it again.
[225:33.86]So, now that there are people here.
[225:39.24]I mean, there's been people here for a while.
[225:42.15]Let's talk about this important thing.
[225:45.19]Because it's going to get really hard to stream games that have a graphic fidelity of more than 300 pixels.
[225:54.33]I'll give you the scenario.
[225:56.73]So, the scenario is...
[226:02.73]Hold on, let's let the... Hold on, I can't... It's hard for me to talk like this.
[226:09.32]So, over the next couple of days, right, I have a moving company, essentially.
[226:21.18]They are dropping off a box, and I'm filling it with all my stuff.
[226:27.08]This is happening in like two days.
[226:29.84]So everything, my computer, all my stuff, everything I pretty much own is going into like a truck.
[226:39.53]So it's going to Vegas.
[226:44.73]I'm not gonna be able to see it or touch it for about two and a half weeks.
[226:50.14]I have a backup computer, but I'm shipping my monitors
[226:55.92]so I think I'm gonna I'm gonna have to do laptop streams I hope they lose it you hope they lose my computer why why would you say that now I'm gonna be nervous about it so we're gonna have to do some uh interesting streaming setups after Wednesday
[227:26.11]then of course uh I'm gonna have to take three or four five maybe days off on the first week of October because that's when the move is actually happening it's insured yeah it's all insured it's really it's okay we'll figure something out but I do have I'm probably going to keep this small monitor here so I can still at least stream with my other computer
[227:54.51]I'll see what I can do.
[227:55.37]But my computer is going to be gone in two days.
[228:01.60]The process actually begins in two days.
[228:06.62]So with that being said, that's pretty much all I needed to say.
[228:11.15]Re-chat on your phone.
[228:14.23]That would be interesting.
[228:18.83]Where was this?
[228:19.25]Like here?
[228:22.87]Alright, so now I gotta go talk to Jeffrey 2 or something, right?
[228:29.25]Can I sell something to somebody?
[228:33.82]I'm gonna go back into the cathedral.
[228:45.61]Can I do PS4 streams?
[228:47.79]I could do PS4 streams.
[228:49.97]How can we help?
[228:53.23]So consoles will be actually what I'm going to have to predominantly stream on for the next couple of weeks.
[228:58.83]Except for a couple of streams that I want to do here and there that are not on console.
[229:03.81]We'll be right behind you.
[229:06.99]So that's... I gotta talk to this dude.
[229:09.19]It's the smell, really.
[229:10.59]I'm just waiting for Captain Mattius to get here.
[229:12.47]I am not bringing my PS4.
[229:14.63]It's not going in the box.
[229:18.68]Yes, I have it.
[229:19.90]Why?
[229:25.29]The theory is because Etalyx has a PS4 Pro.
[229:29.19]I would have the baby PS4.
[229:32.85]His PS4 is just way better.
[229:33.67]I'm coming with you.
[229:34.27]If we make it, I'll open the door for you.
[229:35.52]I've still got some fight left in me!
[229:51.20]Am I going to keep playing this?
[229:52.38]Yeah.
[229:54.78]I would say so.
[229:58.31]I mean, obviously, I'm trying to learn about all these mechanics and all these things.
[230:03.45]But I think it's a fun game.
[230:06.45]I don't know if I want to ruin it with mods yet.
[230:09.27]I mean, I'm going to eventually, right?
[230:11.51]That's going to happen.
[230:17.85]That's just certain.
[230:24.03]You know, like, turn the goblins into, like, Family Guy characters or something, right?
[230:28.31]Like, I'm sure it exists.
[230:31.65]We're not doing that yet.
[230:32.51]Alright, here we are.
[230:45.40]From inside.
[230:53.97]You know, now that I'm doing it, I kind of want to use the bow.
[230:55.99]I feel like the bow would be fun to use.
[230:58.49]What do you guys think?
[231:06.85]I don't want to hit anybody.
[231:08.71]Oh, my God.
[231:11.49]Oh, my God.
[231:12.27]I'm in trouble.
[231:13.23]Oh, no.
[231:14.19]Fuck.
[231:14.77]What the hell?
[231:17.71]Oh, and I'm all the way back here here.
[231:19.51]Oh, God.
[231:20.88]No.
[231:21.14]Thank God I'm not back here.
[231:29.31]Stealth archer is fun.
[231:38.94]Is he dead?
[231:49.91]Come on, swing.
[231:59.09]Pooper-spoon?
[231:59.89]Pew-per-spoon?
[232:00.49]What is a pewter-spoon?
[232:07.35]Who wants to watch somebody play Stealth Archer?
[232:10.93]It's probably fairly interesting.
[232:12.47]You sneak up behind them and shoot them in the head.
[232:17.79]Eventually here, I'm gonna be super strong.
[232:23.13]I'm gonna make a bunch of money.
[232:26.41]And I'm gonna turn into like Stewie Griffin.
[232:36.49]Did they run by me?
[232:41.07]Hold on.
[232:45.79]Stay.
[232:46.37]I gotta lose.
[232:53.14]Don't.
[232:53.70]Please.
[232:54.40]I didn't mean to.
[232:54.96]You got in the way.
[232:55.52]There was a big flame.
[232:58.82]What does that mean?
[232:59.54]Uh, it means exactly what it sounds like.
[233:04.22]Mods.
[233:10.91]Probably should use some of these things, huh?
[233:15.47]Absorb one.
[233:16.19]Inspiring touch.
[233:18.83]Drain five health.
[233:23.24]So that's two.
[233:26.30]Okay, let's do it.
[233:30.22]Can I watch Family Guy on stream?
[233:33.76]I'm not legally allowed to do that.
[233:37.24]I would probably get into some trouble.
[233:39.48]Uh, does that not work?
[233:44.26]Do I have to learn that or something?
[233:48.96]Because I can't press any buttons.
[233:50.47]That one accidentally hit me.
[233:56.57]It's called Netflix?
[234:00.53]Oh god fucking dammit, I have to press C.
[234:07.56]What?
[234:08.98]I'm... confused.
[234:10.62]I'm confused.
[234:20.49]Where?
[234:20.65]Oh, it's like the Ninja Turtle thing.
[234:21.95]Okay.
[234:37.71]I found the tunnel entrance in Kvatch.
[234:39.43]I need to follow up to the gatehouse so I can raise the gates and let the guards into the courtyard castle spot.
[234:47.52]Do I have anything I can eat here?
[234:51.60]Kind of in a world of shit here.
[234:55.04]We can wait one hour.
[234:55.76]Alright, we're good.
[235:03.30]That's all good.
[235:06.84]I mean, I could put the bow... No, no.
[235:09.18]We're going to stick with this.
[235:10.63]For now.
[235:12.39]We healing potion.
[235:13.15]I'm going to put this on one.
[235:19.17]What is night eye?
[235:19.91]Alright.
[235:25.17]Let's go.
[235:26.61]So, this way.
[235:30.26]Watch the fire.
[235:30.84]Watch your feet.
[235:32.30]Don't burn them.
[235:37.63]So by the way, if you're curious, we're going to pick up tomorrow where we leave off here in the next little bit.
[235:46.67]Tomorrow's stream is going to be during the day.
[235:52.40]Not going to be in the nighttime.
[235:54.94]Is it?
[235:55.98]Lead the way.
[235:56.90]I'm right behind you.
[235:59.46]Lead the way.
[236:00.38]I'm right behind you.
[236:02.06]Day.
[236:02.84]By day, I mean... Where the hell am I supposed to go?
[236:08.95]Did I just jump through this?
[236:10.29]What is this?
[236:10.65]Is that the right quest selected?
[236:13.76]Oh, well that was hard to see.
[236:26.60]Yeah, the stream will probably start around... I want to say 1 or 2 p.m., maybe?
[236:33.84]3 p.m.
[236:33.92]Eastern?
[236:37.76]The stream will be pulled back at least two or three hours tomorrow, at least.
[236:43.78]I gotta raise this.
[236:44.64]Hold on.
[236:44.82]Get out of the way.
[236:49.77]I've raised the gates.
[236:50.73]I must now help their men to feed the monsters.
[236:53.37]I'm afraid to swing here.
[237:05.77]In fact, I'm just gonna hang out.
[237:08.78]That's the main guy.
[237:12.06]That's the main guy.
[237:13.12]I think he just got headshot.
[237:16.56]He got shot in the back with an arrow.
[237:18.72]Okay, I'll try.
[237:20.42]Wait a minute, hold on.
[237:21.60]Can I... No, I can't when he's unconscious.
[237:39.24]Alright, you're good.
[237:40.22]Charge the courtyard!
[237:44.28]Yeah!
[237:49.81]This area is clear.
[237:51.27]We've got to get inside and find the Count before it's too late.
[237:53.93]Charge the courtyard!
[237:55.15]Ooh, steel longsword, iron boots, iron gauntlets, all of it.
[238:03.76]Take it all.
[238:04.56]Take that too.
[238:04.96]That's house key.
[238:07.98]Wait, hold on.
[238:08.66]I took this guy's key to his house.
[238:11.86]Oh, shit.
[238:12.64]Hold on.
[238:12.96]Can I go in his house?
[238:28.03]Iron boots.
[238:29.49]Iron gauntlets.
[238:31.53]Iron greaves.
[238:34.99]Everything else is going into the trash.
[238:42.85]230.
[238:43.03]What do I have here that I can just get rid of?
[238:47.80]230 at a?
[238:48.40]That's some shit.
[239:08.26]40, 40, 180.
[239:08.54]This is just, everything's too heavy.
[239:18.68]Silver nugget?
[239:19.84]I don't want to get rid of that, though.
[239:20.94]A lot of block picks are empty.
[239:33.07]Drop the maces?
[239:37.45]Alright, I can drop one.
[239:43.63]I mean, I guess I could pick this back up and sell it now.
[239:48.40]Yeah, okay, that's good.
[239:50.64]Finally have heavy armor on.
[239:57.80]Get the sword?
[239:58.49]Uh... Hold on, it's too late.
[240:09.77]Put the rakes down.
[240:12.36]What if I want to plant something?
[240:21.00]Are you not dead?
[240:22.42]Again?
[240:22.66]So can I steal from him when he's not, uh, conscious?
[240:30.28]Jesus.
[240:31.36]Um, that's a bad place to be is in the corner.
[240:35.44]Oh, shit.
[240:48.09]Oh, you asshole.
[240:49.05]I haven't saved in a while.
[240:55.36]Why is your health still there?
[241:00.34]Alright, this is it.
[241:02.88]We'll hold this area.
[241:04.61]You head to the back of the castle and find the Count.
[241:08.25]Don't come back here without him.
[241:14.41]Steel bow?
[241:16.27]I can't pick this up.
[241:19.79]Fuck.
[241:22.01]And I can.
[241:22.45]And then eat some fucking apples or something.
[241:34.99]Somebody said get rid of the pickaxe.
[241:40.02]But what if I need it?
[241:42.60]Drop the other mace.
[241:45.20]Well, I am now.
[241:47.82]Steel bow 30... 11...
[241:52.04]This thing sucks.
[241:52.94]Get rid of that one.
[241:55.84]I need the pickaxe.
[241:58.54]Okay.
[242:00.66]I'll believe you.
[242:01.08]Uh, can we wait like an hour?
[242:17.77]Don't think I can do anything with that.
[242:24.87]The Great Hall!
[242:27.01]Save it!
[242:27.33]Alright, let's do it.
[242:38.22]I need a better weapon.
[242:44.96]Where do I get a better weapon from?
[242:48.34]A real weapon.
[242:53.83]Not this piece of shit that I have.
[242:55.20]Man, I'm on fire.
[243:04.50]I'm on fire.
[243:05.04]I'm dead.
[243:05.44]I'm gonna die.
[243:06.12]Yeah, I'm gonna die.
[243:13.97]I just feel like I'm peeling a potato or like shredding cheese.
[243:17.13]I'm not even hurting anything.
[243:28.14]Ooh.
[243:29.12]Ooh.
[243:33.78]Let me see what this stuff is.
[243:40.77]Leather greaves.
[243:42.05]Let's go with chainmail helmet.
[243:48.90]I think I have something better.
[243:50.58]Didn't I?
[243:50.90]I thought I had.
[243:53.50]Maybe not.
[243:56.66]Leather greaves.
[243:57.62]This is one.
[243:58.60]Chainmail boots.
[244:02.42]No.
[244:03.52]So I had a fur helmet on.
[244:04.84]Okay.
[244:10.75]The greaves.
[244:12.79]Oh, no, no, no.
[244:13.43]Wait.
[244:13.61]I'm confused here.
[244:17.83]Do I have pants on?
[244:19.35]No.
[244:19.63]Now I do.
[244:20.91]Wait.
[244:21.43]Now I do.
[244:23.09]Alright.
[244:24.63]I got clothes on now.
[244:31.27]Sleeping quarters.
[244:38.00]I'm in big fucking trouble.
[244:39.64]Is there another one?
[244:42.06]That guy's dead, great.
[244:46.84]Get me out of here!
[244:49.64]They open doors, they open doors, they open doors!
[244:51.24]I don't know, I just got lost.
[244:58.90]Crystal ball?
[245:01.57]Is he at full health?
[245:12.19]Oh, why?
[245:13.05]Oh, why?
[245:13.79]Oh, why?

[247:05.32]What the fuck?
[247:06.82]Hey, stop that.
[247:36.90]At least I fixed the problem.
[247:38.50]No, I can't.
[247:39.20]I'll throw up.
[247:40.08]I'm seriously gonna fucking get sick if I do that.
[247:45.91]Chainmail boots.
[247:46.71]Chainmail gauntlets.
[247:48.37]Chainmail greaves.
[247:49.37]Guard helmet.
[247:51.97]I wish I could compare.
[247:56.78]I think these are better than what I have on.
[247:58.42]Guard Helmet, I think, is a little bit better.
[247:59.88]Let's see.
[248:04.57]JML Greaves.
[248:06.73]Yeah.
[248:07.77]No, they're not.
[248:09.21]Iron Greaves.
[248:11.63]Guard Helmet's one.
[248:12.45]I think the other one's one as well.
[248:15.19]I don't know.
[248:17.39]Let's sell for 45.
[248:18.31]Can you do 360 FOV?
[248:36.81]You can't do 720.
[248:37.33]I think 360 might be the max.
[248:42.97]Yeah.
[248:43.11]360 FOV.
[248:43.23]There it is.
[249:09.10]I can't do this.
[249:09.82]Okay, FOV 1.
[249:17.24]No.
[249:18.18]FOV 10.
[249:19.52]This is just magnifying glass.
[249:37.39]Okay, we're good.
[249:43.45]Don't die in here.
[249:47.60]Why would I?
[249:48.12]Turn it down.
[249:51.28]Alright, nothing else in here.
[249:53.10]Plates.
[249:54.34]Sleeping quarters.

[250:15.52]Plus 4.
[250:15.96]Choose 3 attributes to increase.
[250:27.54]Athletic strength.
[250:30.86]Everything is so wrong.
[250:36.17]How much fatigue you have.
[250:37.27]How much damage you do with melee weapons such as swords and axes.
[250:39.75]I mean, I need blunt.
[250:42.95]Yep.
[250:49.69]Basket case incoming.
[250:54.90]You know, I'm like getting it on my phone.
[250:57.26]I've just grabbed it and... I can't do this again.
[251:07.82]Do you have the time to listen to me whine About nothing and everything all at once?
[251:19.30]I am one of those melodramatic fools Melodic to the bone, no doubt about it Sometimes I give myself the creeps
[251:36.31]Sometimes I give myself the creeps.
[251:39.44]I said that I just said that it all keeps adding up strength again.
[251:43.49]No strength.
[251:44.53]Oh
[252:00.90]Muppet.
[252:02.42]And how about agility?
[252:05.00]Affects your ability to maneuver and balance.
[252:07.64]Your total fatigue and damage done by bows governs the skills of security, sneak, and marksman.
[252:17.03]I think I might look.
[252:19.73]Luck has an effect on everything you do, but no, governs no skills.
[252:25.99]Health.
[252:32.08]Yeah, that's good to me.
[252:37.16]He's drunk.
[252:40.93]Alright, do you just level up every time you go to bed?
[252:42.93]Oh, oh well.

[254:42.83]I didn't rob him at all.
[254:46.58]He left a bunch of stuff on his body when he fell down and didn't open his eyes again.
[254:52.66]That's not on me, you know what I mean?
[254:57.63]Like, when you're about to, like, when you're about to die, you have to take all your clothes off and take all your rings off and shit and hide them.

[255:20.11]Where is the Count?

[255:56.74]No, he's doing the thing!
[255:57.36]He's gonna die!
[256:21.98]He should be around the camp somewhere.
[256:24.10]He was with the survivors we rescued from the Chapel of Akatosh.
[256:30.10]Please, go on.
[256:33.44]Oh, he loves me.
[256:35.33]Don't even need to do that.
[256:37.93]But you're gonna keep your giant sword?
[256:42.13]Why can't I have that?
[256:42.85]What did you even give me?
[256:45.97]Holy shit.
[256:47.43]That's a lot of money.
[256:48.17]I think I'm gonna sell it.
[256:54.45]I'm going to sell that.
[257:09.28]So now that's it.
[257:10.98]Congratulations.
[257:13.10]I can leave.
[257:13.86]I got nowhere to be.
[257:14.60]I don't know what to do now.
[257:16.24]I don't have a mission.
[257:20.26]I'm lost.
[257:21.12]I don't know what to do now.
[257:22.42]Tell me where to go.
[257:24.56]Alright, let's, speaking of going.
[257:28.90]Wear it, sell the one you're wearing.
[257:32.58]The one I'm wearing is not worth $700.
[257:37.39]It's now safe.
[257:38.51]Okay.
[257:41.71]List of locations.
[257:45.67]Joffrey told me that the Empire has an intelligent son named Martin who's currently serving as a priest in the chapel of Akatosh of the city of Kvatch.
[257:54.48]That's right out here.
[257:55.72]Let's get out of here.
[258:06.59]The city of crotch.
[258:16.39]I'll be over.
[258:16.89]Will I be able to recover if I take that?
[258:17.93]24.
[258:17.97]Yeah.
[258:18.09]Whatever.
[258:26.45]43.
[258:26.55]These things are so heavy.
[258:33.34]But here's the deal.
[258:34.20]We're probably going to get here... And we're probably going to get to a stopping point up here.
[258:40.88]And we'll do the subs and the bits and everything.
[258:43.41]Go for about five hours.
[258:44.59]And then tomorrow afternoon, we're going to do it again.
[258:49.71]Tomorrow we'll start early.
[258:52.75]Wait, is this the right... Am I going here?
[258:58.05]Oh no, he's doing the stop streaming voice.
[259:00.51]What do you mean stop streaming voice?
[259:04.49]What does that mean?
[259:10.80]Well, okay, so I guess...
[259:18.09]It sounds like he's doing an outro.
[259:20.75]Well, okay.
[259:21.61]I think that's... Yeah, I can see that.
[259:28.69]It's when you get all soft-voiced.
[259:40.40]Look what you guys did.
[259:44.31]Let's just get on the horse and go this way.
[259:46.41]At least I don't look like an asshole anymore.
[260:05.09]Elevator going down.
[260:23.36]Here we are.
[260:28.34]I'm almost dead.
[260:33.84]Hi, guys.
[260:34.32]Does anybody here have any supplies?
[260:39.32]You?
[260:40.44]You're a quest person.
[260:41.52]What about you?
[260:42.08]You sell?
[260:42.80]You buy?
[260:43.46]Which one of you buys?
[260:46.74]Which one of you sells?
[260:48.72]I'm sorry.
[260:49.94]I don't think I'm going to... Go ahead.
[260:55.88]Well, isn't that sweet of you?
[260:57.44]I just gave her money.
[260:58.48]No, I didn't want to give you money.
[261:00.28]I wanted to click these buttons.
[261:03.43]I just walked up and handed this lady money.
[261:06.67]Okay.
[261:07.93]Thanks.
[261:11.83]Hey, you want your money?
[261:14.19]Who wants your money?
[261:15.28]You're the one who closed it.
[261:18.46]What?
[261:19.58]Okay, here we go.
[261:21.00]And how does this work?
[261:23.76]So, you...
[261:26.14]That's really funny.
[261:27.48]So I don't understand the... I try... The hot zone... So you have to... Hold on.
[261:43.67]You watch their face.
[261:45.53]Okay, so joke.
[261:49.09]Watch his face.
[261:50.03]Now he's angry.
[261:50.59]He's very... He's angry.
[261:51.39]He's angry.
[261:52.01]Okay.
[261:55.89]He's still angry.
[261:57.99]I can't argue with that.
[262:00.17]Now boast.
[262:01.59]I doubt it.
[262:09.74]Click if it's hot and they are smiling, or if they are angry and it's cold.
[262:13.08]It's OK.
[262:17.15]That's great.
[262:18.11]How's it go again?
[262:19.85]Smiling.
[262:20.79]I doubt it.
[262:22.91]Angry.
[262:24.58]What nonsense.
[262:28.14]I won't fight you.
[262:35.32]I don't... I don't understand what the fuck this is.
[262:37.83]Like, okay.
[262:39.63]Explain this to me.
[262:41.43]So you start.
[262:42.67]You have these four fucking wedges that you have to click on.
[262:51.61]So, oh my fucking god, it's when you scroll over it, his emotion changes.
[262:57.77]I thought it was he was reacting to the shit that I was saying.
[263:05.17]I thought it was I was clicking and he was saying, oh, hey, haha, and then he was going to smile.
[263:08.52]I didn't, whatever, okay.
[263:11.68]So, you don't want to click on the ones that makes him angry.
[263:16.78]You want to click on the, so this one is the best one to do at this moment.
[263:23.93]You win this one.
[263:24.99]Okay.
[263:26.73]So that makes him happy.
[263:28.53]He's really going to get angry at that one.
[263:30.27]This one's very normal.
[263:33.91]So it's either boast or joke here.
[263:36.09]It's probably joke, right?
[263:37.35]That's great.
[263:39.99]How's it go again?
[263:43.02]It makes him really angry.
[263:45.10]So I don't want him to do the one that makes him angry.
[263:47.72]I doubt it.
[263:52.01]Not now, not later, not ever.
[263:54.50]I guess... That makes him happy.
[263:59.60]That makes him... He's normal with... Okay, coerce.
[264:02.68]I can't argue with that.
[264:05.81]Minimize his anger.
[264:07.47]So, I wish I could just pause it.
[264:12.51]I doubt it.
[264:15.03]Oh, that's great.
[264:15.75]That's really too much.
[264:19.30]Don't talk such rot.
[264:22.71]I'm gonna throw this guy off the fucking bridge.
[264:25.60]Don't bother.
[264:31.72]I'm still confused how the wheel works.
[264:33.28]You understand, no... Just get the big thing in the... In a big smile... Yeah, so it has to be at the... Happy equals good, frown equals bad.
[264:43.22]Yeah, but you have to eventually click on every single one of them.
[264:48.04]So, like, that's a huge smile, so... Okay.
[264:54.11]This is, like, another huge one.
[264:55.67]And he's... Oh, I... I can't argue with that.
[264:59.92]So then do this one.
[265:02.46]Because that's the minimum amount.
[265:04.10]And then this one's normal.
[265:05.16]I did it.
[265:05.38]And again.
[265:06.24]Here.
[265:06.38]Wait.
[265:10.64]Here.
[265:10.90]Uh, anger.
[265:11.38]And then...
[265:22.88]I doubt it.
[265:24.40]Now do that five times.
[265:25.42]Hold on.
[265:25.66]Does it change every time or is it the same thing every time?
[265:33.91]Oh, that's great.
[265:34.61]That's really too much.
[265:39.87]I doubt it.
[265:42.71]You've got a point.
[265:45.71]Don't talk such rot.
[265:51.14]I'm practicing on him.
[265:54.57]So why don't I just do the angry one first?
[265:56.93]Don't talk such rot.
[266:00.35]I doubt it.
[266:01.89]Where'd you get that?
[266:02.79]That's good.
[266:05.09]I can't argue with that.
[266:09.94]I thought it was random every time, so it's not.
[266:13.20]I need to see this a handful of times.
[266:15.70]You've got a point.
[266:20.46]I like that a lot I doubt it don't waste your flattery on me so same thing again I can't argue with that I just have to like that's really funny oh he's gonna be bad I doubt it I keep getting back to 26. I like that a lot
[266:52.70]I should do the angry one now.
[266:53.98]Your speech craft is just do it faster.
[266:58.92]I'm just like playing fucking blackjack.
[267:21.29]The smallest one has to be in the angry slot.
[267:24.62]Where'd you get that?
[267:25.50]That's good.
[267:28.86]I won't fight you.
[267:30.82]Not now, not later, not ever.
[267:33.38]I doubt it.
[267:38.76]I doubt it.
[267:42.24]I like that a lot.
[267:47.39]Don't talk such rot.
[267:50.03]I won't fight you.
[267:52.35]All the wedges rotate to the right, so this one will be over here.
[267:56.16]I like that a lot.
[268:00.70]You've got a point.
[268:02.72]Not now, not later, not ever.
[268:06.40]I doubt it.
[268:09.32]Just two guys standing in the rain.
[268:11.89]That's really funny.
[268:16.73]You've got a point.
[268:19.25]Don't talk such rot.
[268:21.45]I doubt it.
[268:24.91]That's great.
[268:25.87]How's it go again?
[268:27.49]You win this one.
[268:29.59]This is stupid.
[268:33.06]I doubt it.
[268:34.06]Oh, god damn it.
[268:34.88]Don't waste your flattery on me.
[268:37.78]Like, I took my eyes off for a second, and now all of a sudden I can't do it anymore.
[268:44.24]I won't fight you.
[268:47.69]I doubt it no I that's don't waste your flattery on me I doubt it where'd you get that that's good once you're done win this one don't talk I need to get this like 10 at least or something so I don't want this to go over here I need this to go
[269:17.56]I doubt it.
[269:19.22]Oh, that's great.
[269:19.92]That's really too much.
[269:22.44]You've got a point.
[269:24.06]Don't talk such rot.
[269:27.01]Oh, that's great.
[269:27.71]That's really too much.
[269:29.79]I won't fight you.
[269:33.15]Don't try to manipulate me.
[269:35.77]I doubt it.
[269:37.99]Yeah, I doubt it too.
[269:41.06]I like that a lot.
[269:43.20]Don't talk such rot.
[269:45.99]You win this one.
[269:47.81]I doubt it.
[269:49.21]I mean, I'm getting it, but it's like... That's great.
[269:51.85]How's it go again?
[269:52.75]This is just odd.
[269:54.73]You win this one.
[269:56.67]I doubt it.
[269:57.59]Oh, shit!
[269:58.81]How nice.
[269:59.75]It's just what I wanted.
[270:02.27]What?
[270:02.49]That works for me.
[270:06.01]Bye.
[270:07.73]I'm never doing that again.
[270:09.47]I will pay people.
[270:10.63]I'd rather pay people than do that for like 10 minutes.
[270:14.99]In fact, I want to push this guy off the edge.
[270:18.03]I'm so annoyed with that.
[270:19.05]Alright, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[270:22.75]Just throw money in their face.
[270:26.65]Is it Z?
[270:27.09]You hold Z?
[270:27.89]Alright, I need to sell stuff.
[270:32.99]Who can... Can this guy sell?
[270:36.34]Or should I just... I'm just going to fast travel to a merchant.
[270:40.80]Lighthouse, Castle Anvil...

[271:29.59]No, no, no.
[271:31.33]I want to sell.
[271:31.95]Alright, get rid of this.
[271:42.79]That's a fair deal.
[271:45.98]What else we got?
[271:48.40]Sell the staff.
[271:49.82]Good call.
[271:52.71]Should I have done that?
[271:53.47]Was that a bad idea?
[271:55.89]Good call.
[271:56.91]There it is.
[271:57.37]$292.

[272:14.96]Actually, fuck that.
[272:16.02]Get rid of this one.

[273:12.84]No deal.
[273:13.68]Hey, no deal.
[273:14.28]What are you talking about?
[273:15.36]What are you talking about?
[273:29.32]Alright, I think that's alright.
[273:32.08]No, get rid of these arrows.
[273:33.16]Steal longsword too.
[273:34.14]See you later.
[273:36.68]Steal... I need another fucking weapon.
[273:40.48]This shit sucks.
[273:45.43]This actually sucks.
[273:51.79]I think that's alright.
[273:52.73]Thank you for your patronage.
[273:57.82]Steal a weapon.
[274:01.70]Oh, put that down.
[274:09.08]Um... Where do... Is there, like, a blacksmith in this town?
[274:16.45]First edition.
[274:17.21]Where's the blacksmith?
[274:19.51]So I can just take a fucking weapon.
[274:22.91]Imperial commerce.
[274:25.71]Staffs.
[274:27.41]Discount spells.
[274:31.70]Divine Elegance.
[274:35.11]Mystic Emporium.

[274:39.87]5... 3... 3... 5...
[275:06.62]Oh, fuck.
[275:16.64]This prairie dog.
[275:24.16]Okay, I got a strategy here.
[275:27.06]So, as you see, I bait him up the stairs.
[275:30.57]And then I sprint around.
[275:33.53]Crouch grab.
[275:36.87]Steel Warhammer.
[275:37.51]It's 5 damage.
[275:43.28]It's the best thing he has on the display there.
[275:46.08]Oh, Iron Helmet.
[275:48.40]Okay, so that hit... 3... 4... Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[275:52.92]So, come up the stairs.
[275:53.70]I'm going to open up your door.
[275:54.55]No, I'm not.
[275:55.87]Sprint down here across.
[275:56.61]Grab that.
[275:57.61]Sneak around.
[275:58.03]Grab Steel Warhammer.
[276:19.90]I fucking screwed it up.
[276:21.42]Take every book.
[276:28.04]Ow.
[277:05.32]I don't know, what?
[277:06.48]I can't do it.
[277:08.22]So I just can't do it.
[277:28.95]When all else fails, trash it.
[277:34.19]Jesus!
[277:38.32]Why can I not move?
[277:41.83]Oh, I'm over encumbered.
[277:44.49]I can't move but I can fight.
[278:09.50]What the hell was that?
[278:10.66]I'm currently being pushed through the wall.
[278:13.92]Got it.
[278:47.92]There's a desk.
[278:48.44]What's in the desk?
[278:49.45]Let's find out.

[282:19.50]Alright, steal a mace on the table.
[282:20.94]I already took this.
[282:21.84]I can't take something else.
[282:23.24]This thing's good.
[282:25.26]I'm ready to do a quest.
[282:26.34]You know what I'm saying?
[282:27.10]I want to do a mission.
[282:29.84]Something I haven't done before.
[282:34.04]Take a look at the list.
[282:41.33]Where was the thing?
[282:42.47]I have to go to talk to Martin, right?
[282:52.40]Alright.
[282:53.50]Martin.
[282:55.60]There you are.
[282:56.28]Let's just fast travel to Kvatch.
[283:01.27]Go to the arena.
[283:02.29]Not yet.
[283:05.73]Some other time.
[283:06.63]Some other time.
[283:10.09]Martin.
[283:10.35]That's Sean Bean, by the way.
[283:13.01]Has to be.
[283:13.39]Yeah, it is.
[283:14.09]Look at an all-star cast.
[283:16.50]What happened to the all-star cast in Skyrim?
[283:36.33]Yes, I'm a priest.
[283:39.15]You need a priest?
[283:41.19]I don't think I'll be much help to you.
[283:43.89]I'm having trouble understanding the gods right now.
[283:47.31]If all this is part of a divine plan, I'm not sure I want to have anything to do with it.
[283:52.57]Wasted on a dragon.
[283:54.60]They got the Mario voice actor to be a dragon.
[283:57.12]Yeah, that's true.
[283:59.72]Gods or not, we need your help.
[284:01.28]If you came to me for help, you're more of a fool than you look.
[284:05.25]Look around.
[284:06.61]What good is a priest?
[284:09.05]Did you watch the beginning of my stream?
[284:12.17]You should have.
[284:14.29]Emperor Uriel Septon, you think the emperor is my father?
[284:18.57]No, you must have the wrong man.
[284:20.07]I am a priest of Akatosh.
[284:22.09]My father was a farmer.
[284:24.33]What is in his eyes?
[284:25.19]Is that my reflection?
[284:29.47]You spoke to the emperor before he died?
[284:31.99]And he told you to find me?
[284:33.95]Should I get McDonald's tonight?
[284:35.40]That's a bad idea.
[284:36.54]I'm not gonna get... I'm gonna eat, like... I'll eat fucking... Toast.
[284:41.16]I don't know.
[284:42.08]It's strange.
[284:42.84]I... I think you might actually be telling the truth.
[284:46.26]No.
[284:46.54]No, that's a bad idea.
[284:47.94]What do you want from me?
[284:50.99]Come with me to Wayne and Preetory.
[284:52.53]You destroyed the Oblivion Gate, they say.
[284:54.63]You gave them hope.
[284:56.25]You helped them drive the Daedra back.
[284:59.19]What does Max level in?
[284:59.81]Ten?
[284:59.91]Five?
[285:00.03]No, it's not five.
[285:00.51]Alright, let's go.
[285:01.11]To Wayne and Priory.
[285:02.61]Uh... Do we have to walk?
[285:29.90]We have to walk there.
[285:30.66]How far away is this?
[285:31.34]Let's go.
[285:55.89]Fast travel?
[285:57.84]Uh, I mean, I could, but why would I do something?
[286:00.37]Of course I'm going to fast travel.
[286:03.37]I just want to get Sean Bean eaten by a lamb or something up here.
[286:14.70]I'm not a cheat?
[286:17.72]I mean, I could be.
[286:18.58]Sometimes.
[286:18.96]Alright, let's see what happens.
[286:22.14]Let's go this way.
[286:23.08]Let's see if, uh...
[286:28.56]Let's see if he does it.
[287:34.98]So,
[288:17.60]Okay
[288:48.87]I didn't think it was gonna instantly kill him.
[288:51.93]It didn't.
[288:52.27]He was fine.
[288:52.99]That was not as funny as I thought it was.
[288:55.03]Does he get sick of your shit eventually?
[289:05.66]Why was that noise?
[289:16.34]He's gurgling on his own fucking spit.
[289:21.90]What?
[289:30.14]You can't fail a main quest.
[289:31.77]Oh, okay.
[289:33.55]That wasn't as funny as my brain thought it was initially.
[289:36.05]Okay, well, let's bring him back.
[289:38.59]That wasn't quick save.
[289:42.27]It's this one.
[289:50.07]I wanna hit him.
[289:50.73]I got- let me just please baseball swing taunt kill him off the fucking cliff.
[289:55.87]Hold on.
[290:08.50]I will- this is gonna- I'm gonna laugh at this.
[290:10.31]It's just gonna happen.
[290:13.81]No, not quite.
[290:23.40]He's up.
[290:23.94]He's good.
[290:24.94]Can he get back up here?
[290:25.72]I think he might be stuck down there.
[290:35.80]Well, that's a pretty good trick.
[290:36.94]Alright, let's go.
[290:43.54]Fast travel.
[290:44.56]Where are we going?
[290:46.05]I forget.
[290:52.32]I already forgot where we're going.
[290:54.32]Oh, right here.
[291:03.38]What is it?
[291:08.08]Oh, this is somebody that's... You don't sprint at me!
[291:09.66]What do you mean they're right behind me?
[291:19.92]Who's attacking?
[291:21.28]I was in the sheepfold when they attacked.
[291:23.59]I heard the prior talking to someone.
[291:26.47]Alright, let's deal with it.
[291:28.51]The guy was sprinting at me.
[291:31.85]Suddenly weapons appeared in their hands and they cut the prior down before he could move.
[291:37.14]They saw me watching and I ran.
[291:39.18]He's gonna get killed in one hit.
[291:42.32]Where's Joffrey?
[291:42.84]Is he safe?
[291:43.70]I don't know.
[291:44.66]In the chapel praying, I think.
[291:46.40]You must help us.
[291:52.89]What the fuck?
[291:55.39]I'm so... What?
[291:59.89]Oh my god.
[292:00.97]Why am I so good?
[292:03.01]Why am I this good?
[292:04.05]What happened?
[292:04.77]Wait a minute.
[292:05.32]Is the difficulty at like zero?
[292:08.68]Hold on.
[292:09.14]Put this back.
[292:16.84]I'm so confused, man.
[292:18.08]It might be getting late.
[292:27.58]Are we good?
[292:27.96]Let's go.
[292:28.64]Is it the weapon?
[292:29.44]Is it my stolen good weapon?
[292:47.00]What are you doing?
[292:48.04]Is this a... Okay.
[292:53.50]I don't know where he is.
[292:55.93]I'm right behind you.
[292:57.25]Let's go.
[292:57.49]Inside.
[292:57.69]Yeah.
[293:19.72]Dude, how did people survive back in the Middle Ages?
[293:22.76]It's not even possible.
[293:28.40]If you're in a room with more than two or three people, you're all gonna die.
[293:50.27]How did battles happen?
[293:53.72]You had like 200 people on this side 200 people on this side just in these tight places Everybody dies We'll go together, but I fear the worst What I mean that's not what it's like if you had a thousand people charge a castle You're gonna hit your buddy in the back of the head with that with a fucking mallet.
[294:16.43]It's just gonna happen.
[294:17.33]I
[294:19.01]You think there are any more of those assassins about?
[294:23.52]I'm with you.
[294:24.04]200 people.
[294:31.58]Yeah, I don't know, like 1,000 people?
[294:33.30]5,000 people?
[294:34.54]Is this guy dead?
[294:40.10]Just take the valuables, man.
[294:41.10]That's all that matters.
[294:41.64]Alright, we're good.
[294:44.48]So wait, you're still following me?
[294:49.72]I found a drop where he believes the attackers may have taken the Amulet of Kings from its hiding place in Wen'nan House.
[294:55.85]I should go and see if it's still safe.
[294:58.21]So, I'm right here.
[295:02.81]A Legion was like 10,000 people.
[295:06.79]I mean, maybe.
[295:07.73]Um, you guys are forgetting, like, the 20 drunk farmers versus, like, 10 knights.
[295:16.89]They were just, like, shit-faced and would get in fights and stuff.
[295:38.30]No!
[295:40.48]So does he remember when he gets up?
[295:44.40]Or does he have amnesia now?
[295:45.78]Yeah, he's fine.
[295:47.82]But I...
[295:54.42]Alright, let's go.
[295:55.58]Up the stairs.
[295:56.16]Uh, it was... There was an attack.
[295:57.98]Yeah, people were just getting all kinds of brawls.
[296:01.32]Dude, people used to take out their swords and...
[296:20.59]fucking flay each other over, uh... over, like, stew in an inn.
[296:25.86]If your horse shit on somebody's lawn... 500,000 years ago?
[296:46.45]500 to 1,000 years ago.
[296:48.14]If your horse shit on their lawn.
[296:52.84]I'm just going to move on.
[296:53.56]I think I'm getting tired.
[296:54.58]I'm tired.
[296:54.84]100,000 years ago.
[296:55.20]Oh.
[297:08.57]Alright, the war in the West has been ended.
[297:10.17]It isn't widely known, but many brothers of the Order of Talos are also members of the Blades.
[297:17.92]Chapter houses of the Order, like Wayne and Priory, provide safe houses for traveling Blades, as well as our more public religious functions.
[297:26.56]Download a mod that makes the faces less ugly?
[297:28.16]I'm looking for some of the random ones.
[297:29.03]Blades who are too old for the act of service often join the Order as lay brothers.
[297:34.43]We are honored to have Grand Master Joffrey, or Brother Joffrey as he prefers, as a resident here.
[297:41.06]Was I in a frat in college?
[297:42.32]I was not.
[297:44.16]I'm listening.
[297:44.74]I appreciate the gesture.
[297:48.30]Bye.
[297:52.48]Thanks, man.
[297:58.95]I can't take any of these things.
[297:59.99]I'm going to be in trouble if I steal these.
[298:03.71]They've taken it.
[298:04.73]The amulet of kings is gone.
[298:06.41]The enemy has defeated us at every turn.
[298:08.44]That's an interesting sword.
[298:11.00]So it has not all gone against us.
[298:13.08]Thank Talos for that.
[298:14.82]We gained Uriel's heir and lost the amulet of kings.
[298:18.91]Martin cannot stay here.
[298:20.67]We have driven them off, but they will be back once they learn of Martin's survival.
[298:24.79]Which they will.
[298:30.50]Nowhere is truly safe against the power arrayed against us.
[298:33.76]But we must play for time, at least.
[298:37.42]Check his pockets.
[298:38.64]The hidden fortress of the blades in the mountains near Bruma.
[298:42.00]A few men can hold it against an army.
[298:44.83]We should leave at once.
[298:47.43]Okay.
[298:49.03]Uh, sure.
[298:49.85]We should get moving.
[298:51.15]I won't rest easy until Martin is safe at Cloud Ruler Temple.
[298:57.00]Oh, they all came in.
[298:57.68]Never mind.
[298:58.08]Alright, let's go.
[299:02.29]I got my troop of priests.
[299:07.50]50-year-old katana-wielding priest of Talos.
[299:10.18]That guy almost has a long enough custom class as I do.
[299:16.18]Well done.
[299:16.54]Alright, now we have to go to... Cloud Ruler Temple, the Hidden Blades Fortress near Bruma.
[299:35.44]No, this is a different one.
[299:46.95]I'm kidding, it's a joke.
[299:59.19]Needs a... What needs... Needs a key?
[300:04.16]Does he have... What is going on?
[300:05.98]Sometimes you just turn into Steven Tyler when you swing.
[300:09.78]Yeah.
[300:34.72]This is pretty.
[300:42.47]Some interesting architecture.
[300:43.63]They were able to build this stuff like four or five hundred thousand years ago.
[300:50.33]I thought they just discovered fire.
[300:52.09]That's interesting.
[300:57.67]Why do I feel like I'm gonna get executed here?
[301:01.69]The Emperor and his sons were slain on our watch.
[301:05.11]The Empire is in chaos.
[301:08.10]But there is yet hope.
[301:10.06]Here is Martin Septim, true son of Uriel Septim.
[301:15.14]Hail Dragonborn!
[301:16.56]Hail!
[301:17.18]Hail Martin Septim!
[301:21.16]Hail!
[301:22.00]Hail!
[301:22.36]Hail!
[301:22.80]We'll be safe here until you can take up your throne.
[301:26.69]Joffrey, all of you, I know you all expect me to be emperor.
[301:31.61]I'll do my best.
[301:32.47]Who brought the little brother?
[301:33.77]This is all new to me.
[301:36.79]I'm not used to giving speeches, but I wanted you to know that I appreciate your welcome here.
[301:44.70]I hope I prove myself worthy of your loyalty in the coming days.
[301:48.68]What can I do for you, sir?
[301:50.14]Sorry, I'm interrupting.
[301:52.00]Certainly.
[301:54.74]Every little bit helps.
[301:57.54]That's for being a good guard.
[301:58.90]Nice work.
[302:01.34]Am I out of money?
[302:04.56]Oh.
[302:14.19]You need to learn proper.
[302:15.09]Be proper.
[302:39.99]Of course, the amulet of kings.
[302:43.43]So we, I, can take it to the temple of the one and light the dragon fires.
[302:50.13]PNG in the background here.
[302:54.86]The emperor.
[302:57.04]That's an idea that will take some getting used to.
[303:00.02]In any case, we need the amulet first.
[303:02.92]Maybe Joffrey will know where to start.
[303:07.12]Okay.
[303:08.91]Don't worry about me, my friend.
[303:10.29]Where should we go?
[303:11.91]You have proven yourself a loyal servant of the Empire, as worthy as any of the blades to stand by Martin's side during this crisis.
[303:18.58]Wait, somebody brought in 1,500 people?
[303:21.30]I would be honored to accept you in... Hold on.
[303:23.54]Just quiet this guy for a second.
[303:24.98]Wait, there was like 1,500 people?
[303:27.85]Who came in?
[303:28.35]Somebody raided me?
[303:33.41]Oh, Jesus.
[303:36.07]Oh, fuck.
[303:40.33]Well, thanks a lot, dude.
[303:43.21]They all left because of the Martin joke.
[303:49.38]They all of them left.
[303:57.95]I'm sitting there like I get raided by like 1500 people.
[304:01.59]I don't even know it happened.
[304:02.93]I don't even acknowledge it.
[304:05.33]And I'm just hitting this guy with a hammer, tired, and laughing at it over and over again.
[304:10.10]I'd leave too.
[304:12.04]I'd leave too.
[304:15.50]I'd be gone in like five seconds.
[304:22.14]Best host I've ever passed.
[304:25.12]Thanks a lot, RT.
[304:31.59]Yes, I will join the Blades.
[304:33.36]I don't want to join the Blades.
[304:34.94]I want to join the Rebels.
[304:38.52]Are there Rebels in this game?
[304:40.72]Okay.
[304:40.96]Do I have to join them?
[304:42.62]Wait.
[305:01.45]It is good to... Uh, amulet.
[305:03.27]You're right.
[305:04.49]We must try to recover the amulet before the enemy takes it out of our... You should go back to the Imperial City.
[305:10.26]Boris... You'll find Boris at Luther Broad's boarding house in the Elven... That's all I needed to know.
[305:16.02]That's a lot, dude.
[305:16.50]Give my warm regards to Boris.
[305:17.98]Yes, I will.
[305:18.79]Tell him he should not blame himself for the Emperor's death.
[305:21.49]I don't work.
[305:23.39]And by the way, thanks for teaching me the ability Flight Level 1.
[305:51.04]Alright, let's go.
[306:07.98]Can't do it.
[306:10.39]Come on, I can make that, right?
[306:12.21]I just don't feel... Where's my horse?
[306:13.67]How do I call the horse?
[306:15.87]That's pretty...
[306:27.09]Alright, where's my horse?
[306:34.02]I can just fast travel.
[306:35.14]What the hell am I doing?
[306:35.84]Alright.
[306:45.79]A horse is stabled outside the city.
[306:47.77]That's me.
[306:48.19]That's my horse.
[306:49.29]Good.
[306:57.02]Alright, there's Luther Broad.
[306:59.54]Carrots.
[307:02.90]A bard.
[307:05.39]And there's Boris.
[307:07.03]Sit down.
[307:07.93]Don't say anything.
[307:09.25]Just do what I say.
[307:10.45]I feel like he's... Sit down and... Okay, sit down.
[307:23.91]I gotta be ready for anything.
[307:29.18]Yeah, why is it he's so slow to the ground?
[308:10.08]Who's who?
[308:23.63]It's too dark down here.
[308:27.29]Oh, there he is.
[308:30.83]The enemy agent who attacked Barus is dead.
[308:33.17]I should find out what Barus has learned about our enemies.
[308:37.01]search his body I'll keep an eye out in case any of his friends are nearby look it's like I can't see oh a commentary I found a strange book about mythic dawn call that should show this to bars good work I am glad to see you by the way you'd
[309:03.87]What have you learned?
[309:04.35]The assassins who killed the Emperor were part of a Deirdre cult known as the Mythic Dawn.
[309:09.45]Apparently worship the Deirdre Lord, Mehrunes Dagon.
[309:11.79]Why am I speeding the main quest?
[309:13.13]I've been tracking their agents in the Imperial City.
[309:16.11]I'm not, I'm, that's a good question.
[309:17.87]I really should do more stuff on the side.
[309:19.59]I think I'm just like panicking because everybody told me that I went to go do other stuff and I got my ass kicked.
[309:26.82]So I was told to do the main story for a little while.
[309:30.30]So you said that's very bad news.
[309:34.04]I'm not skipping them.
[309:34.86]I'm gonna do them.
[309:35.48]I'm gonna do them.
[309:35.92]I'm gonna do them.
[309:36.33]I'll do them.
[309:37.73]I had hoped I heard you correctly.
[309:40.03]Thank Talos.
[309:41.69]The Blades will protect Martin until he can claim his throne.
[309:44.79]Don't worry.
[309:45.27]Or we will die trying.
[309:47.12]I got my ass kicked in the main story.
[309:50.00]Well, we're gonna go do a mission right now.
[309:53.32]Here, don't worry.
[309:56.95]Why don't you take that book to her?
[309:58.85]See what she makes of it.
[310:00.39]I'll keep running down leads on the Mythic Dawn Network.
[310:03.07]If you learn anything, you can find me at Luther Broad's.
[310:05.93]Okay.
[310:06.61]Metallos guidance.
[310:07.73]Like I said, she's one of the brains over at... Alright, the music is... I gotta get this music out of my head.
[310:17.27]It's nice, but it's too loud.
[310:18.54]I hope you learned something from Tarmina about that book.
[310:21.44]What do we got?
[310:22.24]Let's take a look at our missions here.
[310:25.70]Uh...
[310:29.57]Baris wants me to search the daydream.
[310:31.07]This is not... Okay, here we go.
[310:33.51]Although... Ah, it is... It is like midnight.
[310:40.98]I'm having a good time though.
[310:41.74]This game is really fun.
[310:44.20]You will see this again tomorrow.
[310:46.68]Yeah, five hours and... Yeah, we'll probably go for like five or six hours total.
[310:56.42]So we'll, yeah.
[310:59.62]I really don't want to have this be like a 3 or 4 a.m.
[311:02.04]stream tonight.
[311:04.08]Because I still have a lot of things to do tomorrow.
[311:07.60]Yeah, we'll call it here.
[311:08.26]If you're going to play tomorrow afternoon, you do kind of need to end the stream.
[311:18.27]Yeah, we'll take a break.
[311:21.85]I'll see you guys tomorrow afternoon.
[311:28.63]Because then us being us starting early tomorrow will allow me to go longer.
[311:32.15]You know what I mean?
[311:37.66]Alright.
[311:38.02]Yeah, let's give it a save.
[311:40.78]We'll do a lot of the side stuff tomorrow.
[311:44.98]But it's got me.
[311:46.02]It's got me.
[311:46.74]It's a great game.
[311:47.96]I've never played it.
[311:54.71]Sorry for saying mean things to you.
[311:56.31]Thanks for the stream.
[311:57.67]It's alright, man.
[312:00.59]Am I just dicking around?
[312:06.27]I'm good.
[312:11.52]It really isn't a great game.
[312:13.02]I'm not going to lie.
[312:17.20]Well, it's old.
[312:18.04]It's very clearly old.
[312:20.76]There are a lot of random things UI-wise that I think are pretty just awful.
[312:25.71]But the game's over 10 years old.
[312:34.63]I think it's pretty good so far.
[312:37.73]Let's get it just saved again, just so I know I have it.
[312:40.42]And we'll close that out.
[312:43.52]And we'll cap the stream here.
[312:47.40]Just don't want it to get too, too late, especially if I plan on starting tomorrow early.
[312:52.47]So with that, thank you everybody for watching.
[312:55.77]I'll see you tomorrow, if you're going to watch.
[312:57.29]Probably somewhere around 3, 4 p.m.
[312:58.39]Eastern.
[313:04.18]And then nothing on Wednesday.
[313:07.25]And nothing on Thursday.
[313:10.75]Because those are the two days that I'm loading all my shit into a container and a moving company is taking it across the country.
[313:19.39]So after tomorrow, I'll see you guys on... Maybe I will stream on Thursday because I'm not going to be able to stream on Friday.
[313:28.75]I'm not going to have... No, no, it'll be fine.
[313:32.41]Nothing on Wednesday and Thursday, and then I'll stream on Friday.
[313:36.29]We'll plan it as we go.
[313:37.15]We'll see how it goes.
[313:38.85]But if you're leaving, thanks a bunch for sticking around.
[313:42.26]See you soon.
[313:42.90]Take care.
[313:43.26]Have a great rest of your night.
[313:45.80]And let's do the credits.
[313:49.18]All through that subbed and resubbed tonight.
[313:52.90]Much love to you.
[313:55.18]Also, I wanted to bring something up about the credits.
[313:58.44]And I'm going to do it right now.
[314:02.93]I'm going to talk about it while all these people's names come down.
[314:07.23]Thank you everybody on this list, by the way.
[314:11.31]Much appreciated.
[314:11.91]You guys are incredible.
[314:14.18]But this gives me an opportunity to talk about the future of how this is going to work.
[314:21.00]I'm...
[314:23.06]probably going to I'm going to run this at the end of every stream right but also I kind of want to make this more fun and by more fun I mean I had a handful of ideas where people that subscribed during the stream all these wonderful people that you see here
[314:49.39]will get put into some kind of jokey little end of the stream game and by game I'm not saying like oh you're gonna win prizes no like I was thinking about maybe there'd be some scenario where without giving away any fun details that your name essentially could get drawn out of a hat
[315:10.39]Like a random, you know, one tier one subscriber, a random, you know, tier two, tier three, whatever it ends up being.
[315:17.03]Maybe you have like extra weight to be picked.
[315:19.89]And you get dumb shit.
[315:22.19]Like for 10 seconds.
[315:23.92]One of the things I was thinking of it would be possible.
[315:25.54]I have no idea if it is or not, but I want to try and see if it's possible.
[315:29.16]Like let's say you're one of the people that at the end of the stream, you got like picked.
[315:33.28]Oh, hey, there it is.
[315:34.58]There's the guy.
[315:35.08]There's the guy's name.
[315:36.28]You get chat to yourself for 30 seconds.
[315:39.55]You know what I mean?
[315:41.01]Just do that like with, like pull the lever like five times.
[315:46.18]You know what I mean?
[315:52.12]Because it has gotten to a point where there are so many people.
[315:56.88]There are so many supporters.
[315:59.20]And it's something that I never envisioned I would ever have an issue with.
[316:03.19]But there are a lot of guys and girls that are subscribed now to this channel.
[316:08.01]And it's getting hard to keep up.
[316:13.18]And I still want to be able to show the, you know, we'll still have fun with it.
[316:19.62]Remember, this is all very preliminary, but it'll eventually be here.
[316:29.30]You got to confirm that they're not idle?
[316:31.60]Yeah, I mean, there's ways we can do that.
[316:33.76]I have to get in touch with the right people.
[316:38.25]And hey, look, there's RT Game Crowd.
[316:40.81]Thanks for the sub, man.
[316:42.01]And the raid.
[316:46.70]But as you see, just by looking at the screen, that's a lot of people.
[316:56.19]Thank you so much, guys.
[316:57.91]But I never want to have it get to a position where, because I've told you, I don't like to read necessarily things during the stream just because I get thrown off so easily by the smallest thing in a game or in a stream anyways, no matter what I'm doing.
[317:15.92]But I'd like to continue to address these, you know, these donations and this money and try to incorporate fun things to do.
[317:27.93]Even if I can't read every single name, I'd still like to make it fun.
[317:44.00]Just know that I appreciate every single one of these.
[317:54.08]And down the road, depending on how we go as a channel and as a community on Twitch, I will reevaluate.
[318:02.49]I'm constantly reevaluating everything.
[318:05.57]So we'll see how it goes.
[318:09.29]But for the time being, the credits are going to stay forever.
[318:13.79]It's just the reading portion is probably going to disappear.
[318:19.41]It'll turn into something else.
[318:24.06]Thank you, everybody.
[318:25.86]Let us move on and do the bits.
[318:30.01]Eternal credits.
[318:33.71]And let me... Speaking of credits, speaking of outros, why don't we put this up here?
[318:39.33]So we don't look stupid when we talk.
[318:46.18]What about the bit reading?
[318:48.14]No, bit reading will stay.
[318:50.07]It's just it's hard to have a balance between length and attention to give to certain, you know, a certain level that you have to pay to get read.
[319:05.16]But as the channel grows and as the community grows, it might start to get impossible.
[319:10.96]You know what I mean?
[319:13.02]If there are 500 bit donations during the stream, that's going to take me... You've seen how long sometimes it takes.
[319:23.57]Sometimes it takes hours.
[319:27.37]And it's going to potentially... I'm not saying it is, because I can't predict the future.
[319:35.10]Keep raising the minimum.
[319:37.80]But I don't want to do that until it's absolutely necessary.
[319:41.55]You know what I mean?
[319:44.54]I don't think we're there yet.
[319:46.84]I don't think we'll be there for a while.
[319:48.80]If we ever have that be a thing again.
[319:51.63]I don't think that'll be a thing.
[319:59.15]We'll see.
[320:00.03]There's no implementations going through now.
[320:04.01]Minimum of a 10,000 bit.
[320:06.05]No.
[320:06.51]No fucking way.
[320:10.35]No more four hour post streams.
[320:14.98]No, I mean, I still like to do this.
[320:18.78]But a four-hour post-stream, if you double that, you're talking about, like, potentially five, eight, ten hours to read bits.
[320:28.90]Which is just not... That's, like, physically just not feasible.
[320:34.66]I have to, obviously, try to adapt and come up with solutions, you know?
[320:41.21]But we'll cross those bridges when we need to.
[320:43.45]We'll cross them when we have to.
[320:48.78]Stop going on long tangents during the bit reading.
[320:53.80]Yeah, but I like to give... If somebody brings something up that's interesting or they have something to say, of course we're going to talk about it for a while.
[321:04.71]You know, it's one thing just to be like, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks.
[321:10.07]It feels very manufactured in a way where I'm just saying your name and the number.
[321:17.70]That's
[321:19.66]At some point, it just becomes, oh, he's just doing this.
[321:23.23]He's just reading it because he has to.
[321:25.99]I don't want it to be like that.
[321:32.83]I hope that makes sense.
[321:39.76]Don't leave us?
[321:40.66]What do you mean, don't leave you?
[321:52.38]If bit readings and such become so long you have to reduce the time of the actual content, it's a problem.
[321:58.30]Yeah, and this never was... I don't think the word problem is a good way to put it.
[322:04.93]But back, you know, when we first started doing this, it's been about a year.
[322:09.93]I mean, the channel has grown a lot in the last year.
[322:19.26]print out all the bits on edible paper and eat the messages instead.
[322:28.67]It's been, there's been a lot of growth.
[322:31.81]Yeah, I mean, there's been, there's been a decent amount.
[322:35.63]And I'm now starting to kind of realize that there's a lot of people give lots of money and a lot of people are here and
[322:45.22]That's what we get into the conversations about.
[322:47.58]I want the streams to be worth watching.
[322:49.82]I want you to have fun.
[322:51.24]I mean, I've been kind of like that for a long time now, but even more so, right?
[323:03.46]We'll see how it goes.
[323:04.90]Not making any decisions tonight.
[323:07.14]But let's go back to the Anilander five hours ago here.
[323:11.39]Start at the bottom.
[323:11.99]Thank you for $1, Anilander.
[323:15.20]Hey guys, if everyone donates a bit message that takes him one minute to read every minute, we can keep him here forever.
[323:20.41]See?
[323:20.73]I didn't even read this one yet, and that's exactly what I'm talking about.
[323:26.29]What a great one to start with.
[323:29.01]That is actually the first message.
[323:31.30]And I didn't even see it until now.
[323:39.54]I know I'm not currently subbed, but I sub to people to support their content, not to hear my name read out loud.
[323:44.72]Yeah, I mean, Yakman, you got a great point.
[323:47.57]And, I mean, that's why I don't read subs anymore.
[323:51.71]I don't read anything during the stream.
[323:53.31]Unless it's a very large donation.
[323:57.29]I don't read subs during the stream.
[323:58.91]I don't read bits during the stream.
[324:01.55]We kind of try to do this process where we go over them at the end.
[324:10.21]I haven't read subs during a stream in...
[324:14.61]well over a year now, I think.
[324:23.27]Thank you for not reading too much during the stream.
[324:24.87]Well, I came to a realization a long time ago that I can't do it.
[324:29.20]I just can't do it.
[324:30.26]I personally, physically cannot do that.
[324:34.72]So, that's just the way it is.
[324:38.00]Hey, Timmy, Tim Tam, thanks for the $1.
[324:40.26]Don't start the stream.
[324:41.51]I need to get a drink.
[324:42.75]I already started.
[324:43.63]Sorry, man.
[324:45.49]I've been going for five hours.
[324:47.11]Five and a half hours now.
[324:49.41]Hey, Jeff with a PH, thanks for the $1.
[324:51.14]That just solved the internet problem.
[324:52.76]Yeah, when I started praying.
[325:00.16]For the past few streams, your audio music channel has been slightly dopplered.
[325:07.47]Just wondering if that's intentional.
[325:08.83]Audio music channel.
[325:14.11]It gets tiring when streamers stop to read 30 minutes of subs and donations every hour.
[325:17.61]Yeah, I mean, I... And a lot of the stuff that I do on stream, I... You know, you've seen the streams and some of the stuff, the little bits that we do and the shit that I do sometimes on camera.
[325:31.96]I don't... There's no opportunity for me to... That would break the whole thing.
[325:35.62]You know what I mean?
[325:37.70]If during some of the stuff that I do on stream sometimes...
[325:42.20]am I going to stop doing that and just go over to the computer and just start reading?
[325:47.87]It just throws the whole thing off for me.
[325:59.10]Especially considering some of the stuff that you'll be seeing fairly soon.
[326:03.60]I won't be able to just, oh, hey, by the way, let me like, hey, thanks a lot, you.
[326:09.51]There's no way.
[326:16.04]So we've kind of controlled it and condensed it into this section.
[326:20.46]Which is getting longer and longer and longer every week.
[326:26.20]And it's crazy because it's like, it's not... This is such a great problem to have for... Like, think about it, right?
[326:35.51]Right now we're talking about how much more money you guys... Like, this community has given me over the last year, two years.
[326:42.14]Like, this is not a problem.
[326:45.05]There just needs to be a solution for it.
[326:49.47]It's a very positive problem, right?
[327:04.00]We'll see what happens.
[327:06.84]Thank you, Pocket Pauling, for the $5.
[327:07.94]Oh my God, is this the 1940s?
[327:12.77]Talking about my button up, I think.
[327:14.27]Thank you, Pocket Polly.
[327:17.00]Thank you, Jeff, for the PH for the $1.
[327:18.52]Christian Comcast, bless RNG.
[327:26.20]Thank you, dude.
[327:28.01]Timmy Tim Tim, thanks for the six bucks.
[327:29.47]Hey, Jerma, really looking forward to half an hour of character creation, five minutes of gameplay, and then four hours of console commands.
[327:37.44]No, I actually, like, was... Hold on there.
[327:39.83]I actually was enjoying the game a little bit.
[327:41.85]Like, I liked it, so I didn't just immediately... This guy knows me.
[327:46.75]You know me too well.
[327:49.91]You know me way too well, man.
[327:51.23]That's true.
[327:53.00]Yeah, I didn't summon, like, a Deathclaw one time.
[327:55.58]So... That's for another day.
[328:00.24]I think tomorrow's stream, I still kind of want to just play...
[328:06.38]We'll probably do like a... We'll just do an insane fucked up mod.
[328:10.52]I'll download every mod that's on.
[328:12.46]Every single one that I could possibly get my hands on that I want to play with.
[328:15.94]We'll probably do that this weekend.
[328:22.12]Thanks, dude.
[328:22.48]Thank you, Freebird, for the $1.
[328:25.68]Thank you, Samuel Sish, for the $7.
[328:27.38]So glad to see you playing one of my favorite games of all time.
[328:30.06]Also, new bit badge.
[328:31.06]Jerma Expensive.
[328:36.62]Thank you, dude.
[328:37.84]Harmless, thanks for the $50 back in the beginning of the stream.
[328:41.36]Thank you so much, man.
[328:42.18]It means a lot.
[328:47.53]Wish you the best.
[328:48.03]Thank you, man.
[328:50.19]Rob V, thanks for the $5.
[328:51.77]I just finished about 120 plus hours of this game and I'm so glad to see you playing it.
[328:56.35]If you want to mod it, the process can get pretty weird.
[328:58.83]So if you need any help, I've done some mod editing for this game.
[329:02.30]Also, good luck with your move.
[329:05.45]Yeah, probably after tomorrow's stream.
[329:08.97]Somewhere probably, I'd probably say like Wednesday night or tomorrow night maybe, or before this weekend at some point.
[329:15.86]I'll probably hop in the Discord and just start asking questions.
[329:19.60]Because games like these tend to break all the time when you put mods on them.
[329:26.72]So I will definitely be asking questions to people in the Discord for sure.
[329:31.32]Thank you, Rob.
[329:31.82]Appreciate it.
[329:33.87]Div USP, thanks for the $4.
[329:35.63]No message.
[329:36.84]Snoozing Cofter, thanks for the $1.
[329:38.30]Hey, want you and chat to help me think of some Jerma characters that were born in 2018 or late 2017.
[329:45.30]I'm talking Fireman, BBS, Chuck Schnozwell, and so on.
[329:49.37]Just want to do a little something for the 22nd.
[329:51.27]Uh, a hem.
[329:53.33]Oh, sorry, that's... Which, of course, is no special date at all.
[329:57.67]And there's no reason I'd want to do something special for it.
[330:00.57]Oh, and whatever you're creating today, I will also include for the, you know, the drawing that I just do for fun.
[330:10.22]Uh, late 2017, early 2018 characters.
[330:18.22]Well, I would have to say you got a Duck Law.
[330:21.43]The car guy.
[330:21.97]That's my favorite character that's ever been in a game.
[330:28.53]The doctor.
[330:29.33]The lie detector doctor.
[330:31.03]Absolutely.
[330:35.70]A car.
[330:36.92]Duck Law!
[330:40.84]By the way, in the next Rumble, he's going to have 100 in every stat.

[332:10.43]A lot of, a lot of, um, something I've noticed.
[332:13.15]There's another couple people in this chat, in this community, that are, like, flying planes.
[332:22.00]Remember Dad plane?
[332:22.74]A lot of Air Force I've noticed, a lot of, uh, flight, uh, related.
[332:28.86]It's kind of interesting.

[332:41.47]That's awesome, dude.
[332:42.50]I wish you the best.
[332:43.90]Thank you so much.
[332:53.61]We had Son of Jenova for the $1.
[332:54.85]Hey, Jerma, you know how chat repeats every joke or funny sound you make, right?
[333:00.49]Imagine how that would be in real life, like you're on a stage and people just screaming and repeating the jokes you just said.
[333:14.96]I mean, it'd be weird.
[333:20.01]It's funny you say that, because that actually happened.
[333:25.03]I went to a Dave Chappelle show.
[333:27.03]A live performance by Dave Chappelle.
[333:30.46]And this was at the peak of his Chappelle show popularity.
[333:36.80]Dave Chappelle was back when I was in high school and into getting into college age.
[333:44.52]I love Dave Chappelle.
[333:45.94]I thought Dave Chappelle was the funniest fucking person in the world.
[333:49.85]Went to a show and he got on stage and he was doing his comedy routine.
[333:55.39]Nothing to do with his TV show.
[333:57.55]And this audience, it was what you are describing.
[334:02.16]People were just screaming character names.
[334:06.11]He was in the middle of trying to tell jokes.
[334:07.99]He's like, man, I'll tell you, I went down here and it's like, Tyrone Binghams!
[334:12.44]Tyrone!
[334:14.16]Free crack!
[334:14.80]Free crack giveaway!
[334:15.80]Like people would just scream.
[334:16.70]Like it wasn't just one person.
[334:18.58]It was like 40 or 50 people in the audience and he couldn't get through the set.
[334:22.85]He had to cut his set short and leave.
[334:27.85]Yeah, people would just be screaming like, Rick James!
[334:30.41]Rick James!
[334:31.31]And he's like, man, he eventually was just like, I'm telling you, I know that show.
[334:36.07]It's a great show, but let me do my routine here.
[334:40.19]He couldn't do it.
[334:43.66]It was insane.
[334:46.58]I remember I was with, I think I was with Burgah Boy and one or two other friends.
[334:51.60]And Burgah Boy was infuriated by this.
[334:56.74]He would just try to cut people off.
[334:58.46]So you got the people like Burgah Boy that wanted to hear the show.
[335:04.59]And people were screaming jokes, and then Burgah Boy would scream back at those people in the middle of them screaming, like, shut the fuck up!
[335:15.43]So it'd be like, all you heard was the handful of burger boys that were trying to quiet those people.
[335:21.48]So it was like, Tyrone Binghams.
[335:23.76]Hey, Rick James, shut the fuck up.
[335:26.28]Free crack giveaway.
[335:27.26]Hey, do that character.
[335:28.86]Just quiet.
[335:32.26]It was a mess.
[335:39.76]It was just, it was a carnival.
[335:47.44]but it was uh that that just yeah his show was so popular though okay um you know like for you know like ninja right how he's like the most popular person in the entire universe right now if ninja was on stage that would happen to him that would probably happen to him Dave chappelle was the biggest thing in the world
[336:19.22]he was he was like the fortnight streamer back 15 years ago do fortnight about yeah he's up there like with a microphone and he's like trying to do comedy and people like battle royale fortnight dude get off the boss get on the boss
[336:48.92]Man, I'm trying to do my routine here!
[336:56.75]Quickscope him!
[336:58.63]What a weird- what an odd world.
[337:05.07]Do the orange kid dance!
[337:07.05]Do it!
[337:09.89]And then some of the other Fortnite ninja fans would be like, shut the fuck up, guys!
[337:22.01]Are you really comparing Ninja and Dave Chappelle?
[337:25.83]No, I'm not comparing them.
[337:27.05]I'm just... We're making... No.
[337:31.00]No.
[337:31.72]No.
[337:32.06]I'm not comparing anybody.
[337:38.86]I'm just saying, like, he's... He was at, like, the same level with the crowd that I was.
[337:46.29]You know, 15, 16, 17...
[337:53.04]He was huge.
[338:00.66]Do the... So you're saying... No, I'm not saying even remotely what you just wrote.
[338:10.43]And I'm not even going to say it out loud.
[338:12.45]Because... No.
[338:15.71]That's not what I'm saying at all.
[338:20.97]I got the ages wrong.
[338:22.25]But whatever, my point still stands.
[338:31.88]I've never seen Dave Chappelle and... Oh my god.
[338:40.06]Alright, let's keep going.
[338:47.45]Do the old man voice.
[338:50.44]So he's... That all came from Son of Jenova, thank you.
[338:56.18]But yeah, we went off on a little bit on that one.
[338:58.96]But see, alright, so this is what I'm talking about.
[339:02.62]Somebody said in the beginning, like, oh, if you didn't go off on like tangents on, you know, 20, 30% of the bit messages, then you would be able to get through it in like an hour or so, right?
[339:12.95]But then we don't get to have that conversation.
[339:14.47]You know what I mean?
[339:17.23]That conversation that we just had doesn't happen.
[339:20.14]I like that conversation.
[339:21.48]I like having them.
[339:23.46]I think they're fun to have with you guys.
[339:26.36]Even if sometimes they don't make any fucking sense at all.
[339:31.03]I don't want to lose that.
[339:32.11]You know what I mean?
[339:41.91]But... Thank you, Son of Juno.
[339:45.34]Thank you, Opportunist, for the $15 here.
[339:48.50]Opportunist.
[339:49.06]Hey, Jeremy, I've been watching your content since late 2013.
[339:52.84]Finally caught a stream and thought I'd give back.
[339:54.52]Keep up the fantastic work as always.
[339:56.08]Thank you.
[339:57.58]Opportunist for the $15 and this incredibly encouraging message for me.
[340:04.21]And this wonderful thing that you've said.
[340:07.57]Makes me want to work harder.
[340:09.25]And I am.
[340:09.79]And I will.
[340:11.07]Oh, I will.
[340:14.07]That I can guarantee.
[340:18.10]Candyman, thank you to Candyman for the $5.
[340:19.70]Do combat.
[340:22.36]You can level up stealth later.
[340:23.66]I mean, the whole first two hours of this stream was a joke.
[340:28.93]Green Day picked my character.
[340:30.35]You know what I mean?
[340:33.87]I really should just make another character.
[340:37.05]No, I can't.
[340:38.59]If you make your bed, you gotta sleep in it.
[340:41.05]Right.
[340:45.13]So we're gonna sleep in it.
[340:47.88]Hey, Egg Johnson, thanks for the $1.
[340:49.28]You should play Morrowind, a good game, instead of this game, which is bad.
[340:53.37]Jerm of Comet, Jerm of Glue.
[340:54.61]Here's the Ministry of Truth crashing into... Wait, hold on.
[341:00.15]I don't think you can say that.
[341:03.09]I think a lot of people are going to be mad about this comment.
[341:10.24]Both are good with mods.
[341:14.52]I mean, is it really fair to say any of them... If you're a fan of The Elder Scrolls, they're all made by the same company.
[341:22.76]Right?
[341:25.16]So, is it really... Are you really going to be mad about somebody that doesn't like one but likes another?
[341:34.36]They all suck.
[341:37.83]Well...
[341:45.35]I didn't say that, you did.
[341:49.33]They're all broken.
[341:50.37]Now that I can agree with because every time I alt tab the game it crashes.
[342:04.80]Every game gets better and also worse.
[342:10.36]Crashing into Vive ox dumb head was that Jerma just want to let you know that I hope they don't lose your stuff Me too cuz they're out there.
[342:25.17]Thanks.
[342:26.29]There's thousands of dollars of fucking streaming equipment that if it's gone I'm I'm just gonna like go work at Walgreens Hope not
[342:47.41]I got like my microphone, my stand, my computer, my monitors, my desk.
[342:53.19]If this is gone, I'm gonna have to learn how to... I don't know.
[342:59.92]I have to learn how to like fucking do a trade or something.
[343:12.45]Hello, I'm a former streamer on TwitchGV.
[343:14.47]How can I help you?
[343:22.20]We lost your Nintendo Lavo backpack, sir.
[343:24.78]Now you need to get a job at Walgreens just to make a single stream from your phone.
[343:35.37]I wanna do so much fucking weird shit, guys.
[343:37.74]You have no idea.
[343:42.40]I'm gonna try as hard as I can to make some of these stupid fucking things a reality.
[343:49.16]Like, we talked about the House Flipper.
[343:52.20]If I actually fucking, like, was flipping a fucking house.
[343:56.98]Taking walls down with a sledgehammer and shit and, like, arranging furniture as if it was a game and stuff.
[344:05.29]That kind of shit is, I want to do that so bad.
[344:16.74]I want to throw the turkey into the oven as hard as I can so bad you have no idea.
[344:23.76]So bad.
[344:24.46]That's the intention of going out to Las Vegas and being in the LA Vegas area.
[344:32.34]Ugh.
[344:34.30]I would love nothing more than to be in a Pac-Man costume and throw the turkey in the oven as hard as I can and win Chopped.
[344:43.16]Like, I want to so bad.
[344:47.12]More than anything.
[344:55.31]I'm moving across the country to put a turkey in an oven.
[344:59.01]Just give me some time.
[345:01.21]That's all I ask.
[345:07.90]Even if it's the one joke, that would be the whole stream.
[345:14.34]If you think that, oh no, he just spoiled... I got a hundred things I want to do.
[345:22.22]I'm so ready to go, man.
[345:23.87]I'm looking forward to it.
[345:35.94]Is that lightning?
[345:36.58]That's weird.
[345:37.98]Anyways, uh, thank you Flying Sombrero for the one dollar.
[345:41.10]I got the message that you were streaming in class and was upset that I was going to miss some of the stream.
[345:45.94]I get back over an hour later and he still isn't past the tutorial.
[345:49.96]Thank you for being slow.
[345:53.14]Have we spent at least... We spent a good hour, though.
[345:56.72]Remember, ComCat... Wait a minute, hold on a second here.
[345:59.68]Before anybody gives me... Shit.
[346:03.63]The stream started and we had Comcast bullshit for about 35 minutes.
[346:10.13]Come on.
[346:13.27]And then I made the character.
[346:14.81]I'm not going to make a character in 10 seconds.
[346:17.35]It's going to take me an hour to make a character.
[346:21.58]We listened to the entire Green Day album.
[346:24.38]Back to front.
[346:25.36]We got to the end and then we went backwards.
[346:34.04]Thank you, dude.
[346:34.44]Thank you, PizzaSquirtle, for the $1.
[346:35.96]Hey, Jerma, you've been my absolute favorite content creator since 2012, and your stuff was pretty much my childhood.
[346:42.53]I still watch every second Jerma video that you put up, but I've never been able to catch a full stream.
[346:48.52]I hope you stuck around for this one.
[346:51.28]So thrilled to watch you play one of my favorite games of all time.
[346:53.74]Hope it's not weird to say, but love you, man.
[346:57.30]Please keep doing what you're doing forever.
[347:00.67]I don't think I'll be able to do it forever.
[347:03.11]Because that would mean that I would have to live forever.
[347:06.13]But I'm going to do it as long as I'm still having a good time.
[347:11.37]You all know.
[347:12.39]I've already given you guys the nail in the coffin here.
[347:15.61]If I'm not having fun, if I'm not enjoying it, I'm not going to force myself to do it.
[347:21.85]Whatever that time comes.
[347:23.87]Don't think it'll be for a fairly long time.
[347:28.24]But... I'm... I have to have fun or else I can't do it.
[347:36.47]I have to be interested or I can't do it.
[347:41.25]Please do it forever.
[347:42.47]Do it forever.
[347:44.01]Well, if one of you guys is a scientist in here and you can figure out, like, how to inject me with the... With whatever the genome that makes me live... I don't want to live for... No!
[347:51.15]I don't want to live forever!
[347:53.30]They've made movies and TV shows about this.
[347:55.38]It never works.
[347:56.08]It's always horrible.
[347:57.04]You don't want to do that.
[347:57.80]No one wants to do that.
[348:01.74]They've made like five movies about this.
[348:07.27]But thank you, Pizza Squirtle, so much.
[348:11.01]Hope you stick around.
[348:12.21]There's more to see.
[348:14.15]Thank you, Tar Alacrin, for the $1.
[348:15.79]What's up, Jermbo?
[348:16.87]I haven't been able to catch your streams for a month for a myriad of reasons.
[348:21.85]Oh, that's...
[348:23.34]Welcome back.
[348:24.88]You are never obligated to watch a stream.
[348:27.12]I'm just glad that you catch them.
[348:28.57]If you catch them, that's great.
[348:29.89]If you don't, then hope we see you soon.
[348:35.25]Tara Alacrin also gave another dollar here.

[348:39.91]Anyways, I'm back.

[352:07.75]That classic, you know, it's almost like, here's the thing about Dean Martin.
[352:11.25]Dean Martin was Adam Sandler.
[352:15.02]That was, like, what he did.
[352:16.64]He was, like, the Adam Sandler back then.
[352:18.22]Actually, that, holy shit, that was horrible.
[352:19.84]I should delete that.
[352:20.96]I never said that.
[352:24.08]I didn't say, delete what I just said.
[352:26.46]Scrub it from the internet.
[352:31.81]No, no, no.
[352:32.93]That's not, I'm just talking about like, no, no.
[352:34.19]I don't even know where I was going with that.
[352:36.61]Fucking delete that.
[352:37.51]Don't show that to anybody.
[352:38.43]Don't show that to your family.
[352:39.69]Don't tell your friends about that.
[352:46.35]I can't believe I just said that Dean Martin was the Adam Sandler back when he was around.
[352:53.62]Of his day.
[352:57.89]I have to retract that statement immediately.
[353:06.67]Dean Martin's gonna be pissed.
[353:08.45]Dean Martin is dead.
[353:12.69]Wait, yes he is.
[353:15.87]I fucked this up before.
[353:17.03]I fucked this up before.
[353:23.05]Remember when I remember I thought Bob Barker died like years ago or something I got caught in like being stupid Yeah, Paul Parker is still I thought Bob Barker was dead and easily yeah, I
[353:45.79]He's been dead for 22 years.
[353:50.74]No, that's not funny.
[353:52.67]Listen, I'm just saying that's outrageous that I didn't think that.
[354:23.03]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[354:24.13]No, I'm... I was saying, like, oh shit, like, I can't believe it.
[354:29.70]I thought I didn't know.
[354:30.84]Dean Martin was the ninja of his time.
[354:52.22]You guys think it's a joke.
[354:54.18]You guys think this is so, like, oh, Jerm is just fucking crazy.
[354:57.60]Jerm is out of his mind.
[354:58.87]Oh, Jerm is just, just wait.
[355:01.49]Wait 50 years when, like, Ninja's gonna be, like, he'll have a, like, a plaque somewhere about how, like, he'll be the Dean Martin.
[355:10.49]He's gonna be, like, people are gonna look back and be like, holy shit, yeah, remember Ninja?
[355:16.32]He's gonna be like Dean Martin.
[355:18.16]He'll have a fucking star on the Walk of Fame.
[355:31.31]Like 200 years from now, people will be like, oh yeah, they'll get the Ninja DVD box set thing.
[355:36.90]They'll be infomercials.
[355:39.24]For Ninja's streams.

[355:56.72]You'll see them.
[356:09.33]So here's the thing.
[356:10.31]So who's the current Adam Sandler, right?
[356:12.43]Well, that would be Adam Sandler because he's currently relevant here.
[356:33.81]Ninja is the Dean Martin of Adam Sandler's 90 years ago.
[356:41.39]Adam Sandler's relevant, that's a good one.
[356:43.17]Oh yeah, that is a good one.

[365:22.08]Thank you, Zero.
[365:24.83]Hey, Darkstar, thanks for the $1 here, Darkstar.
[365:26.77]Your streams have been a comfort for me during this hurricane evacuation.
[365:30.15]Luckily, my family and I are safe, and the damage to our house is only surface level.
[365:35.34]However, Wilmington is absolutely flooded, and I'm not sure when the semester will continue.
[365:40.26]I may not get as long a winter break as I was hoping for.
[365:44.58]Uh... Thank God that you and your family are safe.
[365:51.79]That's probably fucking crazy right now.
[365:58.17]Stay safe.
[366:02.03]And I hope you can get back to normal soon here.
[366:06.10]Thank you so much, man.
[366:07.94]Best of luck to you.
[366:09.20]Glad you and your family are safe.
[366:14.12]And then Darkstar, again, thanks for the $1.
[366:15.66]I can't wait for Majestank to become Sneaky Archer.
[366:20.85]StixRenegade, thanks for the $1.
[366:22.35]Your fursona is hideous.
[366:26.53]And then again, Stick says, I took a shower faster than your bathroom break.
[366:30.75]It's not true.
[366:32.57]That's not true.
[366:33.31]Nobody can take a shower unless they... Listen to me.
[366:36.21]This is important.
[366:38.03]I'm going to be real here.
[366:39.27]This is real fucking life.
[366:41.98]Listen.
[366:43.46]Every time that I go to take a shower and I'm going to take a quick shower, I do this thing where I say I'm going to count to 60 seconds and then be out of the shower.
[366:54.23]I get myself ready.
[366:55.29]Okay, I can't fuck around.
[366:56.65]I can't spend 10, 15 minutes in the shower.
[366:59.03]I'm going to count to 60 and then I'm out of here.
[367:02.68]You get in, you turn the water on.
[367:04.38]Here we go.
[367:05.20]One, two, three.
[367:07.66]Let me wash like my feet with the soap.
[367:10.20]Wash my 10, 11, 12.
[367:13.66]Under the armpits.
[367:14.38]Alright, we're going good so far.
[367:15.72]It's not even been 30 seconds.
[367:17.36]This is fine.
[367:18.82]Like 45.
[367:19.22]Let me get the shampoo here.
[367:23.44]Okay, it's 50.
[367:24.78]Okay, let's run this through my hair.
[367:27.28]Okay.
[367:28.92]Alright, let's get a nice lather in there.
[367:31.60]Mm-hmm.
[367:34.79]Alright, I'm going to put a little more soap on me here.
[367:36.79]Alright.
[367:41.93]Did I brush my teeth?
[367:44.23]I don't even... No, I brushed my teeth already.
[367:47.37]Yeah, that's fine.
[367:49.42]Turn the water off.
[367:50.38]Whatever.
[367:51.24]Seven minutes have gone by.
[367:54.54]Every time, and I'm just like, what the fuck?
[367:56.24]I like tried to count and keep myself out of here.
[367:58.62]It happens every single time, I'm not kidding.
[368:02.00]Every single time I try to count in the shower and get out in one to two minutes.
[368:07.89]You just forget for some reason, I don't know what the shower does to you, but after you get to 50 seconds, it's over.
[368:14.57]Your brain forgets why you were doing it in the first place.
[368:21.23]Wait, you brush your teeth in the shower?
[368:23.07]You wanna save some time?
[368:25.49]Brush your teeth in the shower.
[368:26.51]And then you can like just open your mouth and like, ah, and then just the shower will go into your mouth and you can just gargle and spit.
[368:43.85]You're wasting water that way.
[368:45.87]No, you're not.
[368:48.21]If you're in the shower and you have shampoo in your hair,
[368:51.76]and then you condition your hair while your hair is in, while you're conditioning, then you brush your teeth.
[368:58.64]It takes about a minute or two minutes to brush your teeth.
[369:02.30]You spit it out, wash out the conditioner.
[369:04.25]You didn't waste any water.
[369:05.23]You was gonna stand there for two minutes anyways with a conditioner in your hair.
[369:12.79]What do you put your toothbrush when you're done?
[369:13.97]In a toothbrush holder that's on the wall, in the bathroom, in the shower, on the side.
[369:25.97]can wash your body with conditioners in your hair yeah but like you could do a you could do both at the same time you could have one hand with the toothbrush and one hand with the soap I think peeing in the shower is like gets a bad rap guys oh that's oh that's disgusting not if you pissed right onto the drain
[369:55.58]Like, if you piss directly onto the, right in the metal part of the drain, like, it doesn't matter.
[370:00.22]It's going to the same place.
[370:01.20]Oh, disgusting.
[370:01.94]It's going into the sewer.
[370:03.10]It's still gross.
[370:20.55]You don't even know what happened.
[370:23.43]You pee right into that metal plate where the drain is in your bathtub.
[370:28.95]Oh no.
[370:30.83]Whatever will you do?
[370:31.75]When I was a kid... When I was a kid, I used to turn the shower on and pee outside of the shower.
[370:47.07]I would turn, pull my pants down, and piss into the shower.
[370:54.24]I did that for a long time there's a toilet right behind me turn the shower on and I guess I'm just gonna piss into the bathtub I don't know why I just was easier for some reason and you know what it is it's because the bathtub is a giant urinal you don't have to aim
[371:20.93]You could just step into the fucking bath.
[371:23.30]You could stand in the urinal.
[371:24.74]You know you can't stand in a urinal.
[371:27.36]You can if it's a bathtub.
[371:29.72]It's a gigantic urinal.
[371:37.75]Think about it.
[371:57.94]You all think, you all say that I'm crazy, but think about it.
[372:03.26]Use your head.
[372:05.70]A bathtub is, it just accepts liquid.
[372:16.31]With a toilet, you gotta be careful, and nobody pees into the toilet.
[372:21.37]None of you do that.
[372:23.44]Just slow down, hit the brakes here for a second.
[372:25.95]I know all of you don't pee into the water.
[372:29.41]You pee all the way to the edge to make sure that nobody hears you go to the bathroom.
[372:36.13]You don't pee into the water.
[372:37.23]You pee, you hit the side of the toilet.
[372:48.81]He knows.
[372:49.17]Of course I know.
[372:54.13]You pee like directly into the water.
[372:55.57]It makes that like, no, and it gets splashes.
[372:59.73]And you pee very quietly onto the edge and you try very, very carefully to make it that a reality.
[373:04.87]You don't want that to, you don't want to go into the water.
[373:06.67]Touching the water is like, oh fuck, I peed in the water.
[373:28.93]And this just can transition to urinals in public bathrooms.
[373:35.67]I don't, why are they made like that?
[373:39.61]When you pee into a urinal, unless you are standing two or three feet away, it splashes everywhere.
[373:47.49]And don't even give me this shit about the splash pad bullshit.
[373:50.82]All that does is concentrates it to shoot directly back at your, you know, certain part of the male body.
[374:01.26]Why are they made like that?
[374:02.12]It should be a giant tube.
[374:03.26]You should pee into a tube.
[374:07.22]Why are the urinals these flat, non-absorbing, they're just, you should piss into a cylinder.
[374:18.32]Not a flat, hard 90 degree angle.
[374:21.14]Who would thought that was a good idea?
[374:22.44]You know how much money you could save if you just made these like ceramic little tubes that you just pissed down the tube?
[374:34.23]you wouldn't splash anywhere all over yourself and have a little thing that comes down and underneath to you know make it so you didn't drop any pee into the tube get me on a design team I'll make a modern bathroom stalls with closing doors not these the car door stalls that we have in America for some reason
[375:13.57]first victim to test it no yeah I think I don't look I think I feel like I have to draw this on stream I'm and I'm going to because like you guys you guys are you're not picking up what I'm putting down here hold on this is this is this is important it actually is important listen to me
[375:42.71]I'm gonna make this real simple.
[375:51.24]Okay, let's get this up to where it needs to be.
[375:54.04]Alright, so here is just paint.
[376:03.20]And if somebody steals this idea, if you in the next I don't care if it's 10 years from now, I don't give a shit if it's 20 years, 30 years, if you see this,
[376:13.12]You need to give me a call because they took it from this stream and I want a $50 million.
[376:21.58]So here we go.
[376:25.38]Let's, let's draw the bathroom here.
[376:28.24]So let's just say here's your, here's your typical bathroom, right?
[376:31.06]There's the, here's the floor that you got.
[376:34.00]Okay.
[376:34.22]Here's the urinals.
[376:34.88]So let's just say, here's the door like here, right?
[376:38.32]This is what it is now.
[376:40.53]So here's your door.
[376:41.85]You got like your sink over here.
[376:43.17]I'm not going to draw the sinks.
[376:44.15]You just know what I'm talking about.
[376:45.05]Here's the sinks with the faucets.
[376:47.11]Right?
[376:48.43]Whatever.
[376:48.77]That's fine.
[376:50.63]Door.
[376:51.83]Door.
[376:52.29]Door opens.
[376:53.18]People come through here.
[376:54.24]And then what's on the wall over here?
[376:55.58]You got like maybe a little like a hallway down this way.
[376:58.22]And the stalls go over here.
[377:00.02]On the wall, you've got the urinals that are like this.
[377:02.82]Right?
[377:05.18]Here are the urinals.
[377:06.86]Here are the urinals.
[377:09.55]know they're like that they got the little cakes in them and the little flushes right blah blah blah whatever you know it doesn't have to be completely accurate so your guy comes in stands here oh but here's the problem I gotta make sure I go to this one over here because I can't go to the middle one
[377:33.07]Because heaven fucking forbid I have to pee next to somebody, right?
[377:36.73]So, realistically, only fucking two of these are used.
[377:39.94]Okay?
[377:41.12]This one's not used.
[377:41.88]This one's not used.
[377:44.42]So, if there's four urinals and you got two hungry people back here, right?
[377:48.56]There are two hungry people back here.
[377:49.66]They have to wait behind this person.
[377:52.25]Somebody fucks it all up and they go here.
[377:55.27]Initially.
[377:56.99]And then this person can't go and this person can't go.
[378:02.25]So get no, and then the splash, like for instance, I'm not going to draw it, but you know, you know what I'm saying?
[378:08.32]Like, we're just going to write an X here.
[378:09.82]Cause that's like what it is.
[378:11.88]You go to the, you go that way and then let's check it.
[378:15.44]I'm going to remove that.
[378:16.56]Hold on.
[378:17.60]Let's get rid of this.
[378:20.94]So, alright.
[378:21.48]Let's just say that there's a stream of water that was coming from the ceiling.
[378:25.82]Okay.
[378:27.78]And then it's from your ceiling.
[378:29.66]If you get my drift.
[378:31.60]P hits here.
[378:33.94]P hits, water hits here.
[378:36.72]And what does it do?
[378:38.14]Bang, bang, bang.
[378:40.12]All over the floor.
[378:41.50]Oh, that's great.
[378:42.36]Oh, and then like the janitor has to, oh, fuck, I gotta get the mop and like mop, mop, mop, mop, mop, right?
[378:49.83]This janitor doesn't have to do, the janitor can do more janitorial things back here.
[378:57.29]Splashes back gets all over you gets all these shoes and then you stepping here's another problem When you go into a public bathroom and you walk up to one of these fucking like tank urinals you're stepping in a dozen people's piss All under here is P and you're nice new shoes Just get this flop around in there It's bullshit
[379:25.43]Let me show you a better system.
[379:26.57]Okay.
[379:28.09]In fact, let's just, can I get a bigger one?
[379:32.82]Pay attention because I'm going to be a trillionaire one day because of this.
[379:35.76]Alright.
[379:37.22]I think I can just, let's go new.
[379:41.04]Uh, here we go.
[379:42.08]Why don't I do that?
[379:43.04]Alright.
[379:44.02]Better system.
[379:46.59]So you got the door, here's the door.
[379:48.01]There's two different ways you can do this.
[379:49.47]Okay.
[379:52.37]Bingo coming in.
[379:53.53]The sinks don't have to change.
[379:55.69]This doesn't have to be changed architecturally.
[379:57.28]That could stay perfectly fine.
[379:58.22]Here's your little hallway here, and here's your wall.
[380:02.22]And what do we got here?
[380:03.56]This is interesting.
[380:05.06]So instead of these flat, hard surfaces, we have a oblong kind of shaped little spoon here that goes like this.
[380:15.94]And remember, this is leg, leg here, and leg here.
[380:24.29]Leg here and leg here.
[380:26.13]This is somebody standing here, right?
[380:29.95]This has a trough.
[380:34.71]Right here, right there is a big, is a hole.
[380:40.25]This hole is a large tube that goes down this way.
[380:45.88]You pee into this tube.
[380:48.70]No, you don't, you don't pee.
[380:49.80]You don't.
[380:51.80]Water comes from the ceiling.
[380:55.22]and comes this way around here and falls this way and goes through this tube.
[381:03.28]You pee into the tube.
[381:06.38]It doesn't, and you could have a bunch of these, right?
[381:09.39]And you could also have a little privacy thing here, like a little door.
[381:13.41]What you're standing at, this goes underneath.
[381:14.87]If you drop it enough, the piss is not going to get on the floor.
[381:20.75]You stand over this thing.
[381:22.37]It's underneath you between your legs down lower.
[381:26.42]And there's just a big tube you pee into.
[381:35.26]No, this is not going to get this.
[381:36.50]I haven't drawn anything.
[381:37.97]I've just drawn toilets and sticks.
[381:43.35]Then everybody, you got a door, you got a wall here.
[381:46.47]He's got a wall.
[381:47.33]He's got a wall and nobody steps in piss and you don't splash all over yourself.
[381:52.15]It can just be fine.
[381:52.89]It'll drop down there.
[381:55.94]looks the same as the other one it does not no it doesn't look I'm gonna now let's do this draw the prototype okay here we go here is how it would look right no that's not correct wait what is it what what are these named
[382:21.26]What are these named?
[382:22.52]Hold on.
[382:24.21]File recent pictures.
[382:27.25]Scatman Untitled, Idiot, Gog, Face to Face, My Final Pics, My Pics 2, My Pics.
[382:40.78]I don't know what those are.
[382:43.64]No, this is for the emote contest.
[382:46.68]Like, these are my emote pics.
[382:51.13]My final picks.
[382:54.37]Face 2.
[382:55.21]I don't want to open that.
[382:56.43]I don't know if that is.
[382:57.13]Alright, so look.
[383:01.26]Let me draw my prototype again.
[383:02.70]Calm down.
[383:05.02]So here you go.
[383:06.66]This, I like this.
[383:09.96]Okay, this can stay on the wall like that.
[383:11.50]That's fine.
[383:12.00]You can have the flush on the same thing.
[383:13.44]That's fine.
[383:13.98]That doesn't matter.
[383:14.54]It can stay on the left or the right.
[383:15.50]It doesn't matter where it is.
[383:17.23]Here is your giant fucking hole that you pee down.
[383:20.47]And this goes down deep so there's no splash.
[383:23.75]The splash can happen down here, in here, it doesn't matter.
[383:27.85]This is your leg, okay, the guy standing.
[383:30.92]This is a shoe, right?
[383:33.20]And this is the legs going up.
[383:35.60]Shoe.
[383:37.30]Legs going up.
[383:40.20]Here's the bottom.
[383:42.26]This is what I'm talking about.
[383:43.56]Like this goes, wraps around.
[383:48.27]Manual flush instead of a sensor flush
[383:50.27]It doesn't matter you could have- you could have it.
[383:52.27]But this person's standing like this and then the water that comes from the ceiling...
[383:56.27]Because they have a leak in the ceiling or something, I don't know what the problem was?
[385:59.27]Let's make sure we get the right color here
[385:01.27]So they have a leak in the ceiling, there's a problem. Guess what happens if the leak drips down here?
[385:07.27]Oh what's that it catches down here and it's angled goes right down the hole
[385:14.27]Not going down here, not going on here. Going here.
[384:23.70]It's like a Japanese urinal where you squat.
[384:26.36]Yeah, but just like, why don't you just have, why do we have to pee into a wall?
[384:31.50]It doesn't make any sense.
[384:33.76]Five picks.
[384:35.29]Alright, do I, hold on.
[384:37.23]Let me screen this.
[384:42.73]That wasn't found, hold on.
[384:46.19]That one wasn't found either.
[384:50.70]None of these exist.
[384:59.23]This exists, but this... Okay.
[385:06.75]This is just the good old games icon.
[385:12.34]I don't know why I opened this.
[385:18.90]Alright, anyways.
[385:20.42]That's my urinal rant.
[385:22.08]Whatever.
[385:25.27]Whatever.
[385:29.09]Evidence of pirating?
[385:31.45]You mean evidence of purchasing from GOG?
[385:40.27]Anywho, let's get back to this.
[385:42.85]Almost at the end here.
[385:46.33]Fuck, it's getting late.
[385:47.41]God damn it.
[385:49.41]It's all good.
[385:51.17]Maybe we won't be streaming at like 1 o'clock in the afternoon.
[385:55.48]We'll try to be early though.
[385:58.58]Let's get that back on.
[385:59.70]Okay.
[386:03.80]Blame the fucking P. What I made already exists?
[386:11.04]Well, they stole it from me.
[386:12.05]Somebody watched the stream in like a time capsule.
[386:15.93]Good luck, man.
[386:16.47]Good going.
[386:19.45]But anyways, thank you to... Where are we here?
[386:25.78]Bang!
[386:26.28]Thank you, Bang.
[386:28.91]Money for moving snacks.
[386:29.94]Thanks a lot, man.
[386:31.68]RhombaTV, thanks for the two bucks.
[386:34.52]Samuel Sish, thanks for the five dollars.
[386:36.06]Neither your sign nor major skills reflect your specialization or play style, so you probably won't be leveling up much at all.
[386:43.93]Not if we go in and do surgery in the console command.
[386:49.11]Thank you, though, Sam.
[386:50.81]Thank you, Darkstar, for the one dollar.
[386:51.95]Why don't all fantasy RPG games have swindle stones?
[386:55.38]Because not all fantasy RPGs are as good as sorcery.
[386:58.63]Because that's the best.
[387:00.41]Speaking of the best.
[387:01.95]Jerma is the best.
[387:02.99]Thank you for the $1.
[387:03.49]Well, I wanted my first donation to be your first stream next year.
[387:09.80]Which I'll still do.
[387:10.72]But this is important.
[387:11.56]What do you think of the Gorillaz new album, The Now Now?
[387:15.58]The Now Now is pretty good.
[387:19.22]I talked about it before.
[387:20.97]It's a good album to have on the background.
[387:24.32]It reminds me of that one they did when he made it on the iPad.
[387:27.14]A lot of the songs don't have lyrics, so it's very easy just to listen to.
[387:34.54]As a full studio album, though, I don't think it can compare to Demon Days or Plastic Beach.
[387:42.75]Because those are just too... You can't... He will not make another album for the Gorillaz.
[387:51.65]That will be better than either of those two.
[387:53.25]I really don't think he will.
[387:56.59]But it was enjoyable.
[387:57.63]I liked it.
[388:00.39]Thank you for the $1.
[388:03.39]FutureGamer, thanks for the $2.10.
[388:07.49]RTGame rated you.
[388:10.93]Yeah, I think he still might even be here.
[388:14.42]Very nice of you.
[388:15.88]RTGame and FutureGamer for the $2.10.
[388:18.00]Then we got Marfield the... No, not Marfield.
[388:24.24]GarfieldTheMondayKiller for the $1.00.
[388:27.63]Take a look at this one!
[388:28.45]I just, you, nobody heard that.
[388:29.99]I didn't pee into the urinal.
[388:31.73]Yeah, that one's a classic.
[388:32.63]Oh, I didn't see you there, Jerma.
[388:33.67]Still streaming, huh?
[388:35.05]Nothing like a hard day's work to bring in the bits.
[388:37.43]I killed your Monday, so I hope there were any stream hiccups.
[388:40.95]Let me count these... 98, 99, 99, 100.
[388:44.27]Here's your Garf buck.
[388:46.65]Hey Jerma, me and Odie found something called Garfield minus Garfield.
[388:49.67]It's way funnier than the real thing.
[388:51.99]I can't guess the context.
[388:55.64]Garfield versus Garfield.
[388:59.93]Garfield minus Garfield.
[389:06.71]It's just... Alright, what the fuck?
[389:12.25]That's like... It's kind of an odd group of panels there.
[389:19.16]John's just screaming.
[389:20.18]Alright.
[389:22.17]Hey, thank you, Footpowder Spray, for the $1.50.
[389:24.01]Best of wishes on your move tonight.
[389:25.33]Made my day ten times better.
[389:26.65]Thanks for doing what you do.
[389:29.79]Thank you, Footpowder Spray.
[389:31.51]Glad you had a good time.
[389:33.45]Abnormality, thanks for the $5.
[389:34.49]Hey, streamer, thanks for being here.
[389:36.49]Good luck on the move.
[389:37.23]Here's a frigid chocolate milk for your first day in steamy, steamy Vegas.
[389:41.01]I will drink that on stream.
[389:44.83]Thank you, Abnormality.
[389:48.51]Thank you for the $5.00.
[389:51.00]oceans of lotion thanks for the one dollar read faster I'm going rt game crowd gave 15 1500 bucks from 1500 bits from rt game crowd thank you so much man I love you man you're a huge inspiration for my channel I was just wondering how you log the bit donations and messages so you can read them at the end of your stream I try to do the same thing using stream labs but it deletes the messages
[390:19.33]Well, first of all, thanks a lot, dude.
[390:22.60]Hearing that... Obviously that somebody... You've become a pretty... Big success.
[390:31.50]Hearing that I'm an inspiration for you, that means a lot.
[390:34.33]Because that... You got your own thing going, right?
[390:38.27]That's awesome.
[390:40.75]I'm really glad to hear that.
[390:43.15]I'm happy that...
[390:45.22]I mean, it's very humbling and it's a very interesting thing to hear.
[390:48.46]So thank you so much.
[390:53.14]It means a lot.
[390:56.32]But, to answer your question, Streamlabs, you have to get the... You have to connect your Twitch account to the Streamlabs API.
[391:10.97]You have to authorize it and log in.
[391:13.72]And it will delete them.
[391:16.10]The one thing with Streamlabs is if the stream goes down, if you lose connection, you'll lose a lot of that shit that was there before.
[391:27.25]So I don't know why it's deleting your messages.
[391:32.39]I'm trying to think of why it would be doing that.
[391:38.57]I'm really trying to think about that.
[391:39.49]Is Etalyx here?
[391:41.56]Etalyx, are you here?
[391:43.91]Seem to lose it anyway.
[391:45.31]Not sure what's going on.
[391:47.65]So do you like, can you see if you open up like your stream labs and you go to your, your dashboard and you pop out your dashboard and you click on the thing in the top, right?
[391:57.14]Where you can do, um, filters and you put on bits or subs literally pushed play and heard is Etalyx here.
[392:03.14]Alright, well here we have, we have like a technical stream labs question for you.
[392:07.80]Um, that's odd.
[392:13.10]So, RT Game Crowd is... He keeps getting his messages and his bits deleted.
[392:21.60]Like, for no reason.
[392:22.84]And we can't seem to figure out why.
[392:26.52]He had a stream-related question, and I can't answer it.
[392:30.01]So maybe you can.
[392:31.77]Because that's very odd.
[392:33.51]But, regardless, RT... I'm happy to hear that you're doing really well.
[392:41.11]You're doing great.
[392:45.46]And if I can inspire you, then that's great.
[392:47.72]I'm fucking happy.
[392:50.54]I wish you the best for everything else you do.
[392:55.64]Much love to you, man.
[393:02.09]Now thank you.
[393:05.83]Maybe Etalyx can help you answer that question.
[393:07.43]Maybe he can help you.
[393:09.97]Sorry I was not very much help.
[393:14.97]Also, who came in here expecting Oblivion but got some ding-dong ranting about the future of urinals?
[393:29.74]Everyone PM me at the same time.
[393:37.15]Thank you, Captain Soviet, for the $8.
[393:38.61]Hey, Jerma, just wanted to wish you the best of luck on your move.
[393:40.83]We'll be sad to see you leave us in Boston.
[393:44.84]Hope you have a great time in Vegas.
[393:45.92]Here's to the next Jerma Rumble at the Grand Garden.
[393:48.70]Imagine.
[393:51.72]If I could pull something off fucking crazy in Vegas, you know I'm gonna try.
[393:59.25]Thank you so much for the $8, though, dude.
[394:00.55]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[394:01.93]A message from TerribleStrat.
[394:04.82]Jesus Christ, Jerma, I haven't seen you in so long.
[394:07.10]I remember your old TF2 days.
[394:09.26]Good shit, dude.
[394:09.90]You're a big part of my life even to this day.
[394:12.47]Love your content, man.
[394:14.47]Thank you, Terrible Strut.
[394:18.19]Welcome back.
[394:19.03]I'm still here.
[394:19.63]I haven't gone anywhere.
[394:20.97]I mean, I have.
[394:21.45]I mean, I don't make the youtube.com slash Jerma985 videos anymore.
[394:29.47]But, I mean, I'm still around.
[394:31.85]I'm still doing it.
[394:34.86]Thanks for popping in.
[394:38.32]Appreciate it, man.
[394:42.75]Thank you, and also Darkstar, for bringing that to my attention.
[394:45.31]Thank you, Chubby Funster, for the $1.
[394:46.75]Hey, Jeremy, great stream as always.
[394:47.85]Sorry about my past bad pun bits.
[394:50.79]But did you know, when a joke becomes a dad pun, I don't know, when it becomes apparent...
[395:02.38]Oh, right.
[395:02.88]Okay, I get it.
[395:03.60]Yeah.
[395:04.62]That's true.
[395:05.84]That's a good one.
[395:06.86]Hey, Virgil Waves, thanks for the $1.
[395:08.48]Hey, Jerma, I've been watching your stuff for a long time and I can say without a doubt that you're my favorite streamer.
[395:13.76]I can't even be bothered to watch hours of other streamers, but you're something else.
[395:17.14]Much love, never change.
[395:22.19]Thank you, Virgil.
[395:27.67]I hope you stick around.
[395:28.75]Hope you stay tuned.
[395:31.67]There'll be some interesting shit on this stream.
[395:38.89]We'll see if it's any good.
[395:41.01]That's to be determined.
[395:44.38]Thank you so much.
[395:45.20]Thank you, Colonel Crackers, for the $10.
[395:46.84]Hey, Jeremy, big fan.
[395:49.78]I've been watching you since you had less than 1,000 subscribers on YouTube.
[395:54.62]Wow.
[395:56.18]That's a... For the first 1,000...
[396:01.33]Colonel Crackers.
[396:03.09]And this is the first time I've ever donated as I just got a job at the National Security Agency, the NSA, and now have money to spend.
[396:11.40]Thanks for all the laughs through the years.
[396:12.64]Now take my money.
[396:13.56]I'll keep my eye on you at work.
[396:16.33]Oh my God.
[396:29.66]How am I going to be able to pee in a urinal ever again now?
[396:36.69]The NSA is literally watching.
[396:46.33]Well, thank you, Carnal Crackers.
[396:50.57]Thank you, Carnal Crackers.
[396:51.87]When you like...
[396:55.01]When you, like, activate my microphone, like, next week while I'm, like, sleeping, I hope I don't, like, annoy you.
[397:03.61]When you, like, activate my iPhone's mic.
[397:10.43]Nah, I kid.
[397:12.11]That's congratulations, man.
[397:15.22]Grats on the job.
[397:16.78]Grats on the job?
[397:18.26]Grats on the job.
[397:23.36]Better put something on my webcam.
[397:26.66]Can you see me now?
[397:27.46]I don't have any clothes on right now.
[397:33.71]Thanks so much, dude.
[397:37.27]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[397:38.25]Okay, I know you said these end stream bits are getting long, but I just got one more thing to say tonight.
[397:43.89]I love this community.
[397:45.17]The people in this chat are some of the funniest and kindest people I have interacted with on the internet.
[397:49.86]And you are a positive force that brought us together.
[397:52.74]Thank you.
[397:56.01]Yeah, I... I could tell you that some of the funniest shit I've seen... Like, I'm not kidding.
[398:03.65]No bullshit.
[398:04.27]Some of the funniest fucking things I've read over the last five years have come from this chat.
[398:11.35]I look over there and just somebody will say something just absolutely hilarious.
[398:20.31]So I agree with you.
[398:23.66]And also...
[398:25.80]I'm glad that you can find, um, like-minded people here, you know what I mean?
[398:37.41]Hey, easy.
[398:38.87]Hey!
[398:46.58]I can't even read that.
[398:51.40]P is stored in the tube.
[398:59.55]see I told you right right I didn't I just looked over and read that and that was funny but thank you so much dark star I hope you uh stick around for the years to come hopefully we'll do it for a long time thank you man
[399:30.06]Thank you, Chubby Funster, for the one dollar.
[399:31.58]What did the buffalo say to his son when he left for college?
[399:35.20]Bye, son.
[399:38.15]Thank you, Elizabeth, for the one dollar.
[399:39.79]Before you were talking about tangents on the bit messages, I love them so much.
[399:44.81]When I watch the VODs, I never skip them either.
[399:48.05]Never change.
[399:49.04]My favorite man.
[399:53.04]Yeah, I'd like to keep this kind of format.
[399:56.10]It's fun.
[399:58.30]Even if it does extend the stream for an hour or two, it's... It's easier to hang out here.
[400:04.91]Because look, look, look.
[400:07.55]Look.
[400:08.91]If I'm playing a game, or if I'm doing something on camera, or if there's... I'm gonna do like a... Like a pre-thought-out stream today, or I'm gonna do this today, or I'm gonna play a game today.
[400:23.10]Whatever it is.
[400:26.44]Interaction is...
[400:29.35]It's hard to do that.
[400:31.93]I've essentially cut off all interaction during the streams.
[400:35.72]For very small, you know, obviously the small occasions and rare occasions that will come through.
[400:41.94]But being able just to sit here and just chill and hang out and talk to you guys.
[400:49.07]And just laugh about shit and
[400:51.67]Like this.
[400:52.45]Yeah.
[400:53.41]Could I do this on the stream?
[400:54.83]And sure.
[400:55.61]There's only 1200 people here.
[400:56.95]They were, they were nearly 4,000 people here earlier, but this is what a lot of people were describing to me that they, you know, missed.
[401:08.90]I took that to heart.
[401:12.70]I wish, you know, there was more, you know, the chat was a little slower.
[401:15.74]There was,
[401:17.49]More interaction.
[401:18.65]It's not just a bunch of people and he's playing a game and not paying attention, right?
[401:25.61]This is kind of what that is.
[401:33.62]Like, I don't... The fact that, oh, well, you know, like 60% of all the viewers aren't here.
[401:36.90]That's okay.
[401:37.50]People have shit to do.
[401:47.05]People want to just, you know, watch and then that's it.
[401:49.13]And that's completely fine.
[401:50.71]I actually... It's easier to manage this at the end.
[401:55.35]Just hang out for like an hour.
[401:56.71]You know what I mean?
[402:08.33]I like doing this.
[402:08.95]That's why I don't want it to stop.
[402:10.45]It just might have to change a little.
[402:14.83]maybe eventually here if the if the channel continues to grow then maybe we could do like I talked about the whole um sub thing where we you know pull a lever and all of a sudden like somebody gets to dictate like somebody gets to take over chat for 30 seconds or somebody gets to uh
[402:33.41]Like, request a game or something, you know what I mean?
[402:35.23]Like, we could do interesting stuff like that.
[402:36.92]But the same thing could happen with the bit readings.
[402:38.30]Maybe we could pick out... You know... Uh... Not for how much money somebody sent, but... Maybe pull, like, a portion of them.
[402:47.76]And pull ones that have, like, some messages and some jokes and... I just don't ever want it to go away.
[402:53.12]10 second mod status.
[402:58.17]Control the volume of the stream.
[402:59.59]Like, that would be fucking hilarious, yeah.
[403:04.59]Like, get, like, Twitch plays Pokémon and just, like, fight me for the game.
[403:18.78]I've thought of stuff like that, and I've thought of doing streams like that.
[403:27.41]It's all being considered.
[403:31.01]But, thank you.
[403:33.27]Thank you, Elizabeth, for the $1.
[403:36.24]Thank you, Gonderlane, for the $1.
[403:37.70]Here's an idea.
[403:38.26]When you're with your awful placeholder computer, do a sequel to 700,000 games where you just install awful games similar in quality to the video.
[403:46.69]Like Bejeweled Clones.
[403:48.33]Or 3D Brick Breaker games.
[403:50.11]It should be good enough for one stream anyway.
[403:52.73]You know what actually I thought was really funny?
[403:55.27]I realized that somebody...
[403:58.99]Vinesauce right doesn't uh doesn't didn't Joel do something one time where he like tried to get a virus as fast as possible or something that's that's absolutely hilarious he tried to get he booted up like a computer and this the whole thing was I'm trying to break this computer and and destroy the operating system by like clicking on every ad opening like pop-ups and
[404:26.33]Downloading every scammy bullshit program.
[404:32.59]He's done it with every Windows operating system since 1995.
[404:35.75]That's absolutely fucking brilliant.
[404:41.95]He does it every year with a different OS.
[404:45.69]That's great.
[404:49.90]Get chat to install a virus.
[404:56.36]But, yeah, I mean, I was like, oh, what about... Like, I'm like, oh, no, that's, like, he's... He's done that, and it's hilarious when he does it, so... But that kind of idea is funny, to, like, get, like, a bunch of terrible games.
[405:09.77]But... I don't even know if, like, they have anything like that.
[405:14.23]I'm not sure if I have anything like that.
[405:21.39]Maybe.
[405:23.11]But thank you, dude.
[405:23.69]It's gonna be interesting, because I'm not gonna have this computer...
[405:28.20]It's going to be really weird having one monitor and my old computer.
[405:34.00]Hey, Elizabeth, thanks for the $1.
[405:35.52]Why don't you just pee sitting down like a normal human being?
[405:41.58]Thank you, Gift Pool, for the $1.
[405:43.15]You're a good streamer, Jerma.
[405:44.35]Hey, thank you, Gift Pool.
[405:46.25]Gift Pool.
[406:03.15]Kingdom of Loan.
[406:04.16]No response.
[406:05.00]No response to that.
[406:08.38]No response.
[406:09.34]I'm trying to think if... I'm trying to think if I just got... I can't... Did I get memed?
[406:23.91]I may have.
[406:25.17]I may have just gotten memed.
[406:26.30]I'm not sure though.
[406:31.33]Thank you, G-I-F-P-O-L, for the $1.
[406:34.21]Thanks a lot, man.
[406:34.73]Gnome.
[406:40.77]No, no, no, no.
[406:45.22]Thank you, Footpowder Spray, for the $1.
[406:49.78]Jerma, my sides are in orbit right now, please.
[406:55.40]Well, say that name fast.
[406:56.78]Are you here?
[406:59.71]Gif...
[407:01.50]Gif, are you here?
[407:14.57]Yes.
[407:14.85]No, that's not you.
[407:15.47]That's not you.
[407:16.19]What do you mean?
[407:17.31]Yes, somebody got it.
[407:21.17]Are you here?
[407:21.73]Yes, I'm here.
[407:26.76]But anyways.
[407:29.67]thank you thank you jif foot powder spray thank you again thank you sticky brick for the one dollar streamer tries to streamline bit reading process rants for 30 minutes about pissing it did happen thank you I'm a monk for one dollar I can't believe we're still having this conversation FailFish these are conversations that we have to have who else is going to have these conversations how do they make new journals
[407:56.74]Is it they just appear?
[407:58.64]Is it part of the drywall?
[408:00.98]No.
[408:01.52]A group of people have to sit down and discuss peeing into a wall.
[408:06.18]Like we just did.
[408:15.35]Thank you, SFcake, for the $1.
[408:17.31]Hey, Jerma, first time donating here.
[408:18.81]Just curious if you will still play WoW in your off time.
[408:21.97]And if not, why?
[408:23.69]Keep up what you're doing, man, and good luck with the move.
[408:27.36]I just don't have any time.
[408:29.76]The time that I... Okay, I'm gonna break you down, like, my day-to-day.
[408:36.52]Uh... If I'm not streaming... The new expansion pack sucks.
[408:44.39]I've heard that people have a lot of problems with it.
[408:47.13]But... Like, let's just... Dial back to the beginning of what I was about to say.
[408:53.47]Is... I don't, like, have time anymore...
[408:58.57]to dump like 10 to 5 to 10 hours a day on a game like on a game off stream I mean there's obviously like oh I sat here and played Spider-Man for three four days straight right whatever it was but off stream I just don't I can't dedicate that kind of time that wow is requires you to have
[409:25.08]It takes a long time to get much done in an MMO like that.
[409:32.27]And every expansion pack is, it's kind of just, it's like too much for me now.
[409:38.12]Before Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm, just more, more, more, more, more, more.
[409:44.02]Eventually, it's just so much going on.
[409:50.51]I can't even, it's too much.
[409:52.73]Legion was great.
[409:53.98]I loved Legion.
[409:55.18]But I think Legion was the end for me.
[410:00.06]I think I got all that I could possibly have ever gotten from that game after I played Legion for six months or so, a year.
[410:12.45]I just don't have the time off stream to do it anymore.
[410:16.81]But it's still going.
[410:20.07]It's still going.
[410:21.83]I don't know if it'll ever stop.
[410:25.60]I just don't think I will go along with the ride anymore.
[410:30.72]But thank you, SFcake.
[410:32.30]Hope that answered your question.
[410:34.50]DSGZ, thanks for the $1.
[410:37.06]You need to see this video.
[410:38.08]It's very topical.
[410:39.72]I hope I can stay to see you watch it, but at the rate the urinal drawing is going, I doubt it.
[410:47.01]Anyway, I hope this gives you a good laugh.
[410:51.47]At the rate the urinal... Alright, let's watch this.
[411:04.10]I have also... I've seen this, but it's really short, so we can watch it.
[411:13.13]Here we go.
[411:14.03]Browser...
[411:22.78]Farewell.
[411:54.29]What a funny game.
[411:56.73]Seriously.
[411:59.71]Thank you DSGZ.
[412:00.73]Thank you Samuel Sish for the one dollar.
[412:02.45]It exists.
[412:05.69]This is close.
[412:09.93]It's got the pelican mouth.
[412:11.84]But I don't think it has the tube in the middle.
[412:13.90]I think that's still just a piss into a wall.
[412:19.10]Yeah, it's got the pelican dip that goes underneath between your legs.
[412:24.10]I don't see a giant hole there that you pissed down into I'm not clicking that wait did I what did I just click on urinal.net hey the guy that works for the nsa can you like can you like delete this I didn't click on this like can you make it so like I never clicked on this
[412:53.07]urinal dot it's just like somebody's fan website for urinals I don't know why you'd have that though somebody has to pay hosting for that but it's it's a halfway exists hey tor dungle thanks for the one dollar William Shakespeare really was the Adam Sandler of 17th century London seriously also please do factorio with Etalyx and star I'd watch the out of that
[413:23.20]Uh, that's... That's a game where you build a factory.
[413:26.88]Of course it is.
[413:27.34]It's called Factorio.
[413:29.30]Etalyx, you want to play Factorio?
[413:32.70]Uh, I... I don't think I will.
[413:35.58]I wasn't a big fan of that game.
[413:38.62]Star, what about you?
[413:39.48]I don't think so.
[413:40.88]I don't think I want to play that game.
[413:44.64]Perfect impressions, by the way.
[413:46.37]Perfect!
[414:00.07]He's on a fucking Fozzie bear.
[414:03.92]They're both actually here.
[414:05.84]Are you here?
[414:06.38]Yes!
[414:08.94]What about you, Star?
[414:10.73]Yeah!
[414:11.65]See?
[414:12.01]They're both fucking here.
[414:26.76]They have a top 1,000 urinal list.
[414:29.28]You're probably on it.
[414:35.52]What am I now?
[414:36.52]Somebody look it up.
[414:39.04]Have we gone up or gone down?
[414:40.65]Am I still in the top 1,000?
[414:46.39]I don't want to get bumped out of 1,000.
[414:47.43]I don't want to be 101.
[414:50.45]Where am I on the streamer list now?
[414:52.23]I was what, 984 or something before?
[414:56.31]What am I now?
[414:56.77]9... What is it?
[415:04.95]949.
[415:10.43]Have I gone up like 5 places?
[415:13.37]Like 10 places?
[415:14.09]949?
[415:22.59]Sooner or later we'll be 9... 48?
[415:30.77]Take it easy, Marky.
[415:31.83]Marky Yoa.
[415:33.03]See you later, dude.
[415:36.29]$9.51 and a B-plus streamer.
[415:37.85]I told you, I don't want the pressure of being an A streamer.
[415:40.72]No way.
[415:42.76]Give me the B-plus.
[415:43.62]Give me the B-minus for all I... You know, I don't want an A. You have like an A-plus rating.
[415:54.75]You know, the food critic comes.
[415:57.39]and finds a hair in the food, and the small... There could be... Well, if there was a hair in the food, it'd be disgusting no matter what, where you are.
[416:05.92]Let's do a different example.
[416:07.48]An A-plus rated restaurant is if the peas aren't stacked on top of each other correctly.
[416:14.04]Holy shit.
[416:15.22]That's too much pressure.
[416:19.53]In a B-minus restaurant?
[416:22.71]Like, there might be something questionable on the plate that you just brush off, but it's a B-minus restaurant.
[416:29.67]Sure, they might be like a cigarette butt in the bread.
[416:34.61]But, ah, whatever.
[416:36.43]This is a bee restaurant.
[416:38.31]That's good.
[416:39.09]It's nice and cheap, too.
[416:48.23]Thank you, Grapple Mace, for the $1.
[416:49.69]Will this new urinal design muffle the volume of the pee?
[416:53.94]Probably.
[416:54.40]It's going down into a tube.
[416:58.42]Hey, Bang9C9, thanks for the bits here.
[417:00.89]Here's some more funds for snacks.
[417:02.19]Thank you.
[417:05.61]Kai Rallo, thanks for the 101.
[417:07.39]$1.01.
[417:07.69]Okay, what about a stream where you do everything possible to get a virus in your body?
[417:16.18]That would not take a long time.
[417:22.32]All you have to do is drag your tongue.
[417:25.83]Found the Boston subway escalator where people put their hands.
[417:30.95]You just have to stick your tongue out.
[417:34.35]You know the rubber part of the escalator where everyone puts their hands?
[417:37.75]You just get to the top of the escalator.
[417:39.29]You know how the thing is constantly rotating around?
[417:42.98]Just stick out your tongue and hold it there and just let it drag across your tongue forever.
[417:49.38]And you will probably get sick in the middle of doing that.
[418:01.57]It's a disease speedrun.
[418:09.13]But anyways, thank you, Kyralo.
[418:10.90]Thank you, Quimgy, for the $1.
[418:12.80]Hey, Jerm, I've been a big fan for a long time.
[418:14.20]Just wanted to let you know that you're one of the funniest people and watching your videos always makes me cheer up.
[418:19.20]Please keep up the great work.
[418:20.34]From one massive dude to another, you rock.
[418:25.90]Thanks, man.
[418:27.72]It's good to be able to, you know, up high here.
[418:29.92]Thanks, man.
[418:32.73]Thank you, QMG.
[418:33.33]Thank you, DSGZ at the very end here.
[418:35.25]Last one for the $1.
[418:37.27]Here, kid.
[418:37.77]Have an extra hundo for getting my other messages.
[418:41.59]For getting to my other message before I had to leave to bed.
[418:44.29]Just want to tell you that you're genuinely my favorite human being and inspire me daily.
[418:49.45]And have helped me through some seriously dark times.
[418:52.15]Whenever I'm down, I think of something you said.
[418:54.89]There are fucking trees outside.
[418:57.41]And I'm not sad anymore.
[418:58.61]Love you, Jeremiah.
[419:02.37]No, that is... I did say that.
[419:04.37]You're right.
[419:07.00]Thank you so much, DSGZ.
[419:11.64]I hope you're doing better.
[419:18.36]Thank you so much.
[419:23.46]I wish you the best.
[419:29.41]And with that...
[419:31.52]It is almost 2 a.m.
[419:34.02]Thank you, everybody.
[419:36.51]Uh... Stream is not going to be as early as I once first thought here before, you know, getting to this portion.
[419:44.77]Seven hours.
[419:45.83]Okay.
[419:46.75]Cool.
[419:49.23]I'm going to go eat hummus.
[419:50.14]Because that's what I got in the fridge.
[419:54.24]So, good night.
[419:55.28]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[419:57.16]Probably a little bit later than I thought.
[420:00.95]We're not going to start early in the afternoon anymore.
[420:02.53]We'll start early, but not that early.
[420:06.67]Take care.
[420:08.16]More Oblivion tomorrow.
[420:10.94]Have a great one.
[420:12.24]See you soon.
