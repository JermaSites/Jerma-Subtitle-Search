[ve:61.1.100]

[00:01.90]Yeah, that was the bleakest keep.
[00:05.35]Very fun.
[00:06.27]It's $9 on Steam.
[00:07.87]It was worth it.
[00:09.16]It was worth it 100%.
[00:20.61]I also got the Bubsy collection.
[00:26.76]Alright, do you guys want to browse around the Bubsy collection?
[00:29.57]Or do you want to do a water park sim?
[00:34.39]No, no, no, no.
[00:48.23]The Bubsy collection is so bad.
[00:52.62]Yeah, well.
[00:56.00]Alright.
[01:01.19]Okay.
[01:02.97]The last thing that happened in this game was I had just unlocked the very large portion of the park.
[01:17.46]We were doing ice cream land.
[01:21.88]And I only have, what do I have, 76 bucks?
[01:23.86]My idea was I wanted to do individual pools for huge slides.
[01:37.06]See what I'm saying?
[01:38.32]I want a huge slide to go in each individual pool.
[01:41.30]I don't want a big slide going into the same pool.
[01:44.65]I want it to be a line of slides and I want them to all be 50 bucks each.
[01:59.74]59%.
[02:00.20]That's really not a... I mean, it is a majority, but that's not like a super majority.
[02:12.94]Alright, yeah.
[02:13.24]This is going to be Sherbert land.
[02:15.50]So let's do it.
[02:17.23]I'm just going to make some money today.
[02:21.29]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:21.99]This is all screwed up.
[02:23.60]Right.
[02:24.44]Remember I was like, I forgot to sell these.
[02:41.19]Where's the music?
[02:52.08]There.
[02:55.44]No, no, no, no!
[03:00.51]Do I want this here or was that a mistake?
[03:06.77]Actually, no, that's fine.
[03:10.35]This has got to go.
[03:15.40]Play the Bubsy OST?
[03:17.12]What could possibly go wrong?
[03:19.65]I almost had it.
[03:44.52]Park is sick.
[03:50.31]Why do you know Bubsy?
[03:53.87]Because that game came out when I was a teenager.
[03:57.11]I had that game.
[04:00.30]I've rented that game.
[04:05.34]I own that game's cartridge.
[04:08.08]I own that game's cartridge.
[04:10.93]I have Bubsy for Super Nintendo.
[04:19.57]Did you enjoy it?
[04:20.53]No.
[04:21.19]God, no.
[04:28.85]Alright, what am I building towards?
[04:35.25]Resort pools, maybe?
[04:46.74]I definitely want to get those slides in.
[04:48.88]So we have to just do a day.
[04:50.44]We got one day here.
[04:51.84]Let's open the park.
[04:52.56]I just need to make money.
[04:55.55]Did I stock?
[04:56.03]I didn't stock this, did I?
[04:58.43]Oh, yeah, I did.
[04:58.93]We're good.
[05:00.13]No, I need lemonade.
[05:05.60]Let's hit my chin on that.
[05:11.12]I could have just walked out the front door and not had a problem at all.
[05:25.45]Wait.
[05:26.83]Wait, get back here!
[05:29.09]Wait, is that- is that Markiplier?
[05:30.81]That was Markiplier!
[05:33.08]Was it THE Markiplier?
[05:34.38]He was huge!
[05:39.98]Holy shit, there's a line out the door.
[05:42.04]Oh my god, we're in business!
[05:50.15]Uh oh, snacks!
[06:03.01]Where are the snacks?
[06:13.83]Okay.
[06:15.35]Everybody doing good?
[06:16.17]No.
[06:21.84]Who's drowning?
[06:29.49]I'm having so much fun.
[06:34.87]Everyone a hot dog?
[06:38.84]Why is the interior of the ticket office all bruised up?
[06:41.58]I don't know.
[06:42.42]Is it?
[06:51.03]Look for cheaters.
[06:55.34]Why are they having so much trouble going down the stairs?
[07:04.98]Get out of here.
[07:14.53]Thank you for using the trash.
[07:17.83]Oh, hey, what about... Everybody can go in this pool.
[07:23.61]There's more of them over there.
[07:33.28]Alright, we gotta get more people in the park!
[07:36.65]What happened?
[07:37.05]We had a line out the door!
[07:38.15]Ugh.
[07:51.55]Wait, why was that guy running?
[07:58.20]How is nobody hungry yet?
[08:01.58]They do the edibles kicking in, and the music makes this seem like one of those shitty mobile game ads with copyright-free music.
[08:10.69]And there's a hammer at the bottom of the screen as a big button.
[08:13.72]A mop at the bottom of the screen as a big button.
[08:16.06]All that's missing is a fire extinguisher and an alarm clock.
[08:21.59]Dude.
[08:23.73]You're alright.
[08:34.79]It's because he's being paid?
[08:36.19]Wait, you think I'm being paid to play this game?
[08:39.20]Right now?
[08:39.57]What?
[09:02.68]I mean, if a sponsor came in for this, I would have definitely probably have taken it looking at it.
[09:08.67]I'm available, you know, I'm available right now.
[09:18.74]Hey, how does, uh... How does 345 Pacific on, uh... Thursday sound?
[09:29.75]Today?
[09:33.01]No, the game is just fun.
[09:45.15]His naked sponsor rate is on sale too.
[09:54.42]You know, it would be so it would be so goddamn funny.
[09:58.67]No.
[10:03.46]Imagine if in the deliverables of a sponsor.
[10:07.95]Wait, did you cheat?
[10:08.78]I don't know.
[10:11.90]He's like, oh, by the way, we want you to... Is it possible that you can stream with no shirt on?
[10:20.60]Lemonade and ice.
[10:31.29]Alright, that person smells.
[10:33.05]There's a lot of smelly people today.
[10:50.01]Smelly guy just went into the bathroom.
[10:52.82]I repeat, smelly guy went into the bathroom.
[11:01.95]What is this?
[11:02.49]Drugs?
[11:06.18]What am I picking up here?
[11:17.37]It's science.
[11:20.05]Yeah, you could say that about drugs.
[11:23.86]No, no, no.
[11:24.32]You don't understand.
[11:25.68]It's science.
[11:27.86]Yeah, you... Hold on.
[11:30.13]Somebody pissed.
[11:39.89]Wait, what does this mean?
[11:41.05]This person's a VIP.
[11:42.05]I have to make sure they have a great time.
[11:51.96]Right this way, Frankie.
[12:07.22]Oh, get rid of that trash, Frankie.
[12:16.86]Try the water slide.
[12:17.74]It's fun.
[12:21.37]Look!
[12:21.71]And we get sprayed!
[12:30.90]Can I get you a snack?
[12:43.29]There you go.
[12:45.26]Scream if you need anything.
[12:46.54]If you need a hot dog, I'll throw it to you.
[12:55.68]Don't puke!
[13:02.01]Oh, he's in it.
[13:04.22]Now don't go in the pool.
[13:22.86]That person's a pervert.
[13:24.88]That person's a pervert.
[13:26.42]Wait.
[13:27.33]Who's the pervert?
[13:28.23]You?
[13:29.79]Which one's the pervert?
[13:33.11]Which one's the pervert?
[13:34.97]Oh, fuck.
[13:35.40]Hold on.
[13:36.76]Are you a pervert?
[13:42.82]This person's... I have the VIP here.
[13:47.51]What can I get you?
[13:48.69]Lemon.
[13:50.37]Quick service.
[14:02.04]Nobody wanted a hot dog today, which is weird.
[14:12.66]Help is on the way, dear.
[14:25.95]I gotta hand out flyers.
[14:43.74]This pool, people are drowning in it.
[14:45.54]I don't like it.
[15:02.49]Uh, oh!
[15:02.91]Hold on.
[15:04.73]Both.
[15:08.93]You waited too long for lemonade?
[15:11.52]You understand?
[15:12.16]I'm sorry, I got a VIP over here.
[15:19.73]Uh-oh.
[15:21.63]No, I wouldn't... Shit.
[15:29.98]Ugh.
[15:38.49]Ugh.
[15:39.99]Ugh.
[15:40.42]Ugh.
[15:42.45]Uh-oh, I think somebody died.
[16:10.02]Lemon.
[16:11.55]No!
[16:12.96]Here, take it.
[16:19.53]Wait, you don't want this one now?
[16:40.55]Wait, I thought you were a pervert.
[16:50.37]I got five thousand bucks.
[16:52.00]Hell yeah.
[16:56.05]Now I can get some crazy slides in here.
[17:16.92]This does sound like one of those iPad games.
[17:40.49]Very important pervert.
[17:47.76]Look at how many research points.
[17:53.77]Nine points.
[18:01.96]Okay, let's clean up.
[18:03.82]Gross.
[18:09.81]I need my tools.
[18:26.71]Is graffiti all over the toilet?
[18:31.56]Hot dogs are stale.
[18:33.36]I picked those up this morning.
[18:35.02]Liar.
[18:53.49]Looks good.
[19:10.00]They may have already been stale.
[19:13.46]What?
[19:17.33]Well, that's a problem with the vendor.
[19:36.50]Pick up the poop already?
[19:39.49]Is there poop everywhere?
[19:40.37]Hang one thing at a time.
[20:02.13]Get this puke.
[20:09.19]Oh wait, I can sleep and the workers will help me do this.
[20:12.76]Okay, let me do that.
[20:25.61]I forgot about that.
[20:28.96]Alright.
[20:30.22]They'll start doing some work.
[20:33.78]And I can do some rearranging.
[20:39.35]Okay, let's go.
[20:40.41]So... Pools.
[20:45.42]Look at this thing.
[20:48.72]This thing's going to be crazy.
[20:50.44]Alright, I don't want to put it down yet.
[20:57.69]Where should this go?
[20:58.39]I'm thinking... But what does this look like?
[21:05.62]I want this... People walk down here...
[21:14.16]Okay, then the queue can start there.
[21:16.83]Put a couple of seeds, a little bit of decorations.
[21:20.35]I'm going to drop it right there.
[21:22.59]Right there.
[21:23.26]Right there.
[21:24.42]Boom.
[21:35.52]Yeah!
[21:39.80]I do have to remove the palm tree.
[21:47.03]Make a slide go into the dumpster.
[21:49.60]I don't think I can do that.
[22:02.22]Nice.
[22:06.82]Okay, I need that, that, that.
[22:10.57]I want to paint it.
[22:15.92]Let me do it.
[22:16.64]I want to do it.
[22:37.69]Alright.
[22:37.87]I want to turn the little hut off down on the lower left.
[22:39.52]How do I do that?
[22:42.48]I don't think I need it anymore.
[22:51.72]We can do Twitch integration.
[22:57.63]Where is it?
[23:03.84]Game mode.
[23:05.38]You can do hard mode.
[23:08.66]It's not an option.
[23:09.61]Oh, OK.
[23:16.90]This thing is awesome.
[23:24.18]That was so fun.
[23:27.81]OK, now if this is sherbert.
[23:31.96]You gotta get the right color.
[23:36.74]I don't have all the colors I need.
[23:39.43]But let's go orange.
[23:48.54]I guess this whole thing could be a sherbert, right?
[24:02.89]I need pink.
[24:13.11]I could make this the creamsicle slide.
[24:14.50]You know what?
[24:16.22]I'm going to have to make a little bit of a pivot here, guys.
[24:18.12]Sorry.
[24:19.79]This is going to be a creamsicle slide.
[24:50.94]Traffic cone?
[24:52.62]It's a... Oh man, it is like a construction yard.
[24:57.82]You just ruined my whole life.
[25:01.93]VLC slide?
[25:05.17]You just fucked up my whole life.
[25:13.74]No, it's an orange creamsicle.
[25:34.24]Can I paint the inside?
[25:43.55]What if I do the lighter color, the lighter orange?
[25:45.97]This one.
[25:50.06]Hey, that is a little better.
[25:51.42]That's no longer construction zone.
[26:00.49]There we go.
[26:01.73]That's better.
[26:08.61]Delicious creamsicle.
[26:16.36]Looks like a cigarette.
[26:18.13]It is a cigarette pull.
[26:21.05]No!
[26:22.23]It's supposed to be... That's fine.
[26:33.51]I can't paint this.
[26:37.45]Change the white.
[26:39.84]But it's creamsicle.
[26:45.10]Cigarette slide into the ashtray pool.
[26:48.23]Fine.
[26:48.93]That's fine.
[26:49.95]Okay.
[27:03.11]I like it.
[27:07.57]now where yeah you can smoke on this ride by the way only on this ride you can smoke
[27:46.10]Come on, let's go.
[27:56.84]Can they cross over each other?
[28:00.59]I don't have enough money to do it, do I?
[28:02.39]Shit.
[28:06.26]What about this goofy one?
[28:21.00]I wanted to do that.
[28:24.76]No, I want to do it.
[28:34.04]Okay, let's do... Cotton Candy Ice Cream.
[28:42.89]Do I have?
[28:44.26]Oh, I need... I want that one.
[28:50.12]I need to unlock more colors.
[29:02.31]It's gonna be a watermelon slide.
[29:03.60]I need I need this.
[29:06.04]I need that.
[29:06.56]I need that.
[29:07.06]I need that.
[29:07.72]I need all these.
[29:08.24]I give you Santa's workshop.
[29:17.77]There we go.
[29:18.45]Now that is a sherbert slide.
[29:28.50]Maybe I can make this the creamsicle.
[30:13.98]Hold on.
[30:23.49]The tip has to be orange for the spark.
[30:26.11]Or like a red.
[30:26.79]That's too deep.
[30:33.02]That's too red.
[30:37.83]No.
[30:38.69]No.
[30:59.17]OK.
[31:05.00]Make a joint.
[31:07.78]Yeah, all the joint slide would be would be this, but all crumpled up and fucking bumpy.
[31:17.65]I need poles.
[31:22.54]Let's get cheap.
[31:23.76]I don't have any.
[31:25.14]Oh.
[31:28.58]How much is a dirty pool?
[31:30.61]I don't have a hundred bucks.
[31:32.79]I'll smash them chairs.
[32:10.41]Is this thing safe to just not...?
[32:15.70]This is all temporary.
[32:31.31]Alright, I gotta make this shit expensive, right?
[32:37.99]Nothing is safe in this shithole.
[33:06.56]Alright, I got some awesome attractions.
[33:13.21]I just gotta open it.
[33:13.99]Wait, is everything clean?
[33:15.21]Everything stocked up and clean?
[33:17.56]There's still plenty of stuff in here.
[33:18.84]Okay.
[33:20.04]I think we're clean.
[33:21.18]These guys have been working the whole time.
[33:34.81]That just kills the whole vibe for me.
[33:37.41]The whole vibe is killed now.
[33:42.32]This park changed its smell.
[33:45.35]Right now.
[33:46.09]It smells.
[33:47.69]Like a cigarette in here now.
[33:49.59]When I take a left turn.
[33:50.33]Alright, I gotta hand out flyers.
[34:14.28]Smoking section, yeah.
[34:20.69]Ow, my butt hurts.
[34:25.69]That's a VIP.
[34:38.25]That sounded like the uh-oh stinky guy.
[34:41.73]Uh-oh, he's stinky.
[35:05.38]MonkaS, MonkaS.
[35:07.06]I agree.
[35:11.65]Someone's going to go down.
[35:13.31]Look.
[35:16.54]Oh, my God.
[35:18.42]Look.
[35:24.96]25 bucks to use this slide.
[35:27.12]That's crazy.
[35:31.63]Are you stuck in here?
[35:40.09]How do we get a line out the door for that?
[35:52.53]How do you already smell?
[35:58.69]See?
[36:17.11]Imagine riding this slide when the swoopy cigarette is available.
[36:31.39]Does nobody want to ride this one?
[36:33.66]Oh, come on.
[36:47.08]Who's that?
[36:48.22]I heard that.
[37:00.66]Got him.
[37:04.98]He's going to get knocked over.
[37:06.15]That's a horrible place for him to be, isn't it?
[37:19.55]I guess he doesn't take collision.
[37:21.45]I got to hand out more flyers.
[37:32.26]Nobody needs a hot dog.
[37:39.49]Let's go.
[37:47.28]No, no, no.
[37:49.74]Half-Life 1 wall heal sound.
[37:58.59]The health kit thing on the wall.
[38:05.19]Who's drowning?
[38:18.56]Deranged cigarette water park owner beats customer with hammer.
[38:39.92]Did you read that with your finger?
[38:44.99]No, what?
[38:48.98]Uh-oh.
[38:54.61]Uh-oh.
[38:54.75]People want lemonade.
[38:57.64]Oh, boy.
[38:58.64]Oh, hold on a second.
[39:02.92]Ketchup and mustard.
[39:04.97]Oh.
[39:15.66]Oh.
[39:18.42]Oh.
[39:23.66]I need one of those over here.
[39:35.24]I need to hand out one more.
[39:36.82]What was that?
[39:42.19]You want a hot dog?
[39:44.25]With mustard?
[39:47.02]You want a lemonade with mustard?
[39:49.30]Who took a picture?
[39:55.94]Who took a picture?
[39:56.62]I want to know.
[40:02.55]OK.
[40:14.08]This person stinks.
[40:19.35]Who's drowning?
[40:21.35]Oh God, you're across the entire park.
[40:31.85]I keep hearing the camera.
[41:06.53]More unique guests.
[41:07.72]You've met some troublesome guests before, but not every unusual guest is a problem.
[41:11.79]Some might actually help you out.
[41:13.61]Keep your eyes open, you never know what kind of surprise they'll bring.
[41:18.93]Collect research points from smart guy.
[41:47.93]Somebody's still taking pictures.
[41:52.49]I gotta find this picture taker.
[42:09.46]There's trash everywhere.
[42:10.71]Is that why people are puking?
[42:30.05]Oh.
[42:30.97]Everyone did good.
[42:31.65]They go on the slide and then they start to drown.
[42:41.79]Any more points?
[42:50.90]What the hell was that?
[42:51.78]Did somebody drive into the...
[43:05.01]Alright, what do you want?
[43:06.13]Lemonade.
[43:07.07]Good.
[43:09.84]Did you steal?
[43:10.36]You need to get the taser.
[43:24.35]Hey!
[43:27.76]It was one of you.
[43:28.52]It was one of you over here.
[43:29.40]It was one of you.
[43:42.59]You're in big trouble.
[43:45.05]Wrong guy.
[43:45.74]Whatever.
[44:15.23]5000 again.
[44:16.85]OK, I need to mop.
[44:19.21]She's kind of ridiculous at this point.
[44:31.45]Kylo is waiting.
[44:37.76]Get over here, you're fine.
[44:47.41]Hot dog sounds kind of good right now.
[44:49.47]Don't you think?
[45:00.68]I could go for a hot dog.
[45:08.37]You know what?
[45:08.97]An Italian sausage.
[45:12.50]Italian sausage with peppers and onions.
[45:15.40]And a bunch of mustard on it.
[45:18.29]Sounds great.
[45:26.54]That has to be moved.
[45:29.36]This has to be moved.
[45:32.84]That's going to be moved.
[45:34.29]That's a backbreaker.
[45:37.39]Okay.
[45:46.28]Ouch.
[45:56.28]Drop some research points.
[45:58.64]You cheated.
[45:59.04]Is this thing broken?
[46:13.56]No.
[46:14.16]Alright, 5150 bucks.
[46:25.22]I have a ton of research points.
[46:30.40]We'll clean all this up tomorrow.
[46:44.30]I don't see any others, but... I'll pick this up tomorrow.
[46:48.72]Oh, there we go.
[46:55.47]Is that one right there?
[46:58.54]Uh huh.
[47:06.09]Cool, alright.
[47:06.95]Start the day over.
[47:09.54]Turn up the music a little.
[47:16.87]Better?
[47:27.57]flock of seagulls.
[47:39.12]Get over my property!
[48:14.35]This place is a fucking mess, man.
[48:16.77]You should clean up.
[48:43.20]Oh I forgot granola bars.
[49:09.16]50 bucks for this that's a lot that's too much okay now I want to add
[49:39.06]This one.
[49:39.94]No, no, no.
[49:41.64]Other one, right?
[49:43.19]I want one of these.
[49:43.95]And it's going to go into this pool as well.
[50:02.98]I want to do it so bad.
[50:11.80]Will they hit each other?
[50:12.78]We need to find out.
[50:30.19]Alright, what's the anti-cigarette?
[50:32.25]Vegetables?
[50:41.56]yeah broccoli it would be beer this one would be weed no no it's got to be if that were the case it'd be that one of that one oxygen
[51:16.11]No, this is... I think actually it's going to be fine.
[51:22.22]Just don't put your head up.
[52:01.42]they're like fucking tomatoes this is a potato
[52:39.10]There's a carrot.
[52:40.78]Where'd I get carrots?
[52:52.27]This guy is demented?
[53:09.29]I don't like the red at the end.
[53:10.17]I hate this.
[53:19.14]What if it was just blue?
[53:30.88]Coffee and tea.
[53:32.38]Coffee and cigarettes.
[53:34.26]I'll try it.
[54:13.84]This looks like a bloody poop slide.
[54:29.36]Whatever, it just needs to make me money.
[54:44.23]This is gonna eventually turn into ice cream land.
[54:46.77]I just need to get all the things done.
[54:55.52]Ooh, cool.
[55:22.33]These seagulls have been going for the entire time.
[55:32.96]There's no way, right?
[55:46.26]Come on.
[55:46.78]I think actually, I think it would actually work if I could get it, like, to here.
[55:53.50]hold on give me the hammer you're the number one rage inducing streamer
[56:27.28]Bro, I'm just messing around.
[56:29.03]Why are you so full of rage?
[56:50.02]I keep looking at this and it makes me laugh every time.
[57:02.99]I'm just experimenting.
[57:04.07]I'm a tinkerer.
[57:10.48]I don't think so.
[57:23.42]Come on, we have to see, right?
[57:25.26]We have to see.
[57:27.70]This little fool, it's like a circus act.
[57:51.71]Okay.
[57:53.07]That's fine.
[57:53.75]I will fix it all later.
[57:54.93]I just want to get it all out here because I think it's funny.
[57:59.68]I'm very curious what happens.
[58:02.52]Okay.
[58:03.06]Do a prediction in chat.
[58:05.23]Is there more than three direct collisions?
[58:11.03]More than three direct collisions.
[58:25.63]Okay.
[58:30.91]I should make somebody be a concession attendant.
[58:39.79]Poster marketing?
[58:42.75]Ooh.
[58:48.84]That's good, too.
[58:57.01]Okay, this is the taser.
[59:01.62]Somebody said they wanted me to get this.
[59:06.95]Where is it?
[59:07.57]Alright, I gotta open up the park.
[59:09.62]Let's go.
[59:13.19]We gotta get these seagulls out of here.
[59:15.13]Where's the taser?
[59:31.10]uh use it in the pool ouch
[60:06.15]There are so many right now.
[60:07.73]This is crazy.
[60:38.52]Nice.
[60:45.83]Nice.
[60:52.85]Oh, okay.
[60:53.59]People are going down this one.
[60:58.76]That was close.
[61:05.59]Nothing so far.
[61:06.33]Sorry, guys.
[61:11.46]Wasn't that a VIP?
[61:12.42]I probably should have done that.
[61:28.51]Can you make another dumpster?
[61:29.66]I feel like I need it.
[61:48.52]No, these rides aren't that popular.
[61:59.82]What did I do wrong?
[62:10.07]This person smells.
[62:24.91]Alright, drop a few more of those.
[62:30.40]We actually have an opportunity here.
[62:36.63]No, it's going to take too long.
[62:41.21]Wait a minute.
[62:43.32]Oh, man.
[62:45.54]No.
[62:48.66]I think three collisions is generous.
[63:12.72]Get rid of that.
[63:25.66]A lot of people want to go on the twisty cigarette.
[63:35.39]Uh-oh.
[63:39.17]Ugh!
[63:42.22]Why do I want this to happen so bad?
[63:44.16]I'm just waiting for it.
[64:05.14]They're having a lot of fun with this.
[64:10.47]This actually is making a lot more money than I thought it was.
[64:15.43]Oh, you alright?
[64:16.65]Oh, fuck.
[64:38.37]Okay, I have to unlock resort loungers.
[64:42.65]You got it?
[64:56.25]Good.
[64:59.01]Alright, let me clean a little.
[65:09.51]This is not...
[65:11.77]even causing a problem at all it actually turned out to be I only had to have one pool no one's getting hurt everyone's having the time of their life right now it concentrates everybody to this one section and it's 25 bucks a slide just keep putting slides into this pool
[66:09.07]That red slide can't even go under the water.
[66:12.85]Oh, no, we're good.
[66:13.39]We're good.
[66:15.63]They're having fun.
[66:16.74]This is fun.
[66:34.08]I'm stuck.
[66:43.02]Oh!
[66:44.94]That counts!
[66:50.73]Ow!
[66:58.14]No, that's one.
[67:07.07]That looks so painful, but no one is having an issue.
[67:26.02]Dude smashed his head on the pavement, did he?
[67:34.47]Oh!
[67:36.51]That person went into the other slope.
[67:46.80]Oh, they want a trash can.
[67:52.51]It's heating up though.
[67:53.79]Here it is!
[67:55.83]Does that count?
[67:56.66]I don't know.
[67:57.32]I don't know if that counts.
[67:58.34]I think that counts.
[68:04.05]They both hit knees together.
[68:08.85]Oh, people want hot dogs.
[68:34.09]Next.
[68:46.63]There's so much water.
[68:47.47]Didn't I unlock drier people?
[68:53.70]Aren't people supposed to be more dry, quick dry?
[69:12.26]Lionel is terrible.
[69:17.31]Yeah, Lionel is bad.
[69:18.73]We might have to fire Lionel.
[69:31.04]Oh, close.
[69:43.65]I think that person fell off the slide.
[69:47.52]Dude, you only got half of the fund and you still gave me $25.
[70:12.45]No.
[70:14.12]That doesn't count.
[70:28.66]No.
[70:30.85]It's not looking good for the believers here.
[70:41.48]I just love someone who said, dude, this would be insane IRL.
[70:46.77]Uh, yeah.
[70:47.72]I mean, do you mean insane like fun or insane insane?
[71:11.79]Didn't happen.
[71:21.34]Okay, so now... I can clean this up a little bit.
[71:28.05]Or... Do I make... Do I really, really min-max this to get like 10 slides in this one pool?
[71:43.27]I think I could probably fit like eight or nine in here.
[71:49.67]Let's see.
[71:51.21]Let me sleep.
[71:52.47]I'll come back.
[71:52.95]What are you doing?
[72:07.10]I want those research points.
[72:18.63]I'll clean up tomorrow.
[72:27.86]I think every slide should be a cigarette.
[72:31.31]Is that dumb to me?
[72:32.51]I know this whole thing just turned upside down, but I want to do it.
[72:40.76]And this section could be the pack of cigarettes.
[72:45.07]Okay.
[72:46.25]Here's what I'm thinking.
[72:47.75]The ones that are really windy and twirly, we get rid of those.
[72:53.42]We move them out of the way.
[72:54.24]I found a much better spot for them.
[72:58.59]For sure.
[73:03.03]I'm talking get like 10 of these.
[73:05.28]These ones.
[73:06.26]Into the same little pool.
[73:13.18]I'll figure it out tomorrow.
[73:25.06]Alright.
[73:25.53]Let me unlock the resort loungers.
[73:38.24]Resort loungers.
[73:39.70]I think I can do it.
[73:40.40]Yep.
[73:44.59]Advanced marketing.
[73:45.49]Flyers were fine in the early days, but now it's time to go bigger.
[73:48.50]Unlock poster marketing in the research tree.
[73:50.48]Buy posters in the store and hang them around town.
[73:54.78]Okay.
[73:54.90]Okay.
[74:14.42]That's all I can do for now.
[74:15.28]Alright.
[74:20.83]Let's clean up.
[74:32.93]Different music?
[74:33.83]Yeah, what do you guys want to put on?
[74:36.74]What do you want on the stream or radio?
[74:56.05]And what should I get for food?
[74:58.48]What am I doing for food?
[75:00.56]I could make... Here's what I could make.
[75:06.14]I could make... I could make like breakfast.
[75:08.59]That kind of sounds good.
[75:09.63]I could make eggs toast.
[75:17.32]I could make... Ravioli.
[75:24.86]I could make...
[75:29.86]Make like a fried rice.
[75:39.86]Animal style?
[75:41.34]Oh, an animal style dick.
[75:44.21]Oh, that's a... That's a classic.
[75:58.02]What do you think that chatter's doing now?
[76:00.10]Do you think that chatter has a family?
[76:02.63]Two kids or something?
[76:11.52]Absolutely not.
[76:20.91]He's definitely a CEO somewhere.
[76:24.41]Do you think he ever thinks about that?
[76:25.97]Imagine being a CEO, putting your feet up on the desk.
[76:28.62]I own this place.
[76:32.14]Yeah, how about another 50 million?
[76:35.46]And you just think sometimes, remember that time?
[76:38.09]Man, the good old days.
[76:40.37]I told that streamer to eat a dick.
[76:42.59]Oh my goodness.
[76:44.73]Those were the days.
[76:48.27]And he screamed at me.
[76:51.08]Let me pull that clip up.
[76:58.38]Alright, do you guys think you're going to have... Here's this.
[77:02.95]Do you think you're going to have nostalgia about you Omega lulling me five minutes ago?
[77:09.60]Do you know what I mean?
[77:12.06]Do you think in like 10 to 20 years, you're going to think back, remember that time that I told him to like shove it up his ass?
[77:17.13]Oh my god, that was actually kind of crazy.
[77:34.63]Somebody said, I'm gonna miss you.
[77:40.58]Yeah, well, let's... How about we... Okay.
[77:49.69]No!
[77:52.17]Oops.
[78:07.27]Now, I will tell you, this is very important, and listen up.
[78:13.39]Whatever you like right now, and I'm talking mainly, a lot of people in this chat are probably over the age of 25, over the age of 30.
[78:23.58]I know a lot of people here are.
[78:26.24]But if you are a little younger, even if you're in your early 20s, like late teens, listen to me.
[78:33.03]The things that you like right now
[78:36.21]what is your like favorite game or favorite movie favorite TV show right now I implore you to hold on to it whether it be a physical copy potentially or something that you have right now that you know because I'm telling you in 20 years you are gonna want to see this this is gonna be a memory that you'll be able to hold on to
[79:04.67]And taking that with you 10, 20, 30 years in the future, take it from somebody that a lot of stuff I have to go back and, oh, wait, let me go find that.
[79:15.12]Where can I get one of those?
[79:17.12]Where can I get a big Bertha arcade machine?
[79:19.49]You know what I mean?
[79:27.12]Physical media is based.
[79:28.40]All I'm saying is that in 10 to 20 years, you're going to think of the thing that you're doing right now.
[79:33.65]I'm not talking about watching this stream.
[79:34.77]I'm talking about just a thing that you like.
[79:37.15]A band you like.
[79:38.57]A... Oh!
[79:42.14]That's what's next to us?
[79:48.72]But a game you like.
[79:51.57]Definitely take something from it.
[79:53.13]Hold on to it.
[79:54.93]And keep it.
[79:55.61]And don't get rid of it.
[79:58.30]Because you'll be looking for it in 20 years.
[80:00.01]I absolutely guarantee you.
[80:10.60]And it's very important because you're going to be able to place the person that you are, the person that you were, how you felt, how the world smelled.
[80:21.34]You're going to be able to place yourself right there when you hold that thing in your hand.
[80:24.82]20 years from now.
[80:32.66]Physical things are physical memories that you are holding on to.
[80:39.01]Because it's almost like you That's So Raven when you grab it and look at it.
[80:43.23]You just sort of, whoa, right, I remember this box.
[80:45.91]I remember what that looked like.
[80:47.30]Wait, I can use it.
[80:48.24]I can do it.
[80:48.76]I can look at it.
[80:49.32]I can put it on a wall.
[80:50.42]I can put it on my keychain or whatever.
[80:53.66]Why are you a dog?
[80:54.34]Trust me on this.
[80:57.65]Whatever your favorite thing is, you're going to have a fucking smell that goes with it.
[81:02.58]Like I know what the Mario RPG main menu save file menu smells like.
[81:14.38]It brings, it just, you teleport to where you were.
[81:24.32]Okay, let me make a slide.
[81:26.46]Let's move some stuff around.
[81:36.84]Because being able to actually... Because memory is an interesting thing.
[81:43.73]Trust me on this.
[81:45.53]I have said and done thousands of things.
[81:50.82]I kind of remember some of them.
[81:53.20]I kind of remember a lot of them.
[81:59.19]But when you hold on to something, you lock that memory away into an object.
[82:04.52]It's like a fucking horcrux.
[82:19.48]Okay, let me move that.
[82:20.74]Wait, I need a little bit more room.
[82:28.71]Okay, this has to be right in the middle.
[82:36.38]So what you're saying is that you're immortal.
[82:43.72]It's very interesting though, because as I've been collecting a little more, I've been collecting some more stuff.
[82:52.50]This is going to be crazy.
[82:59.24]I'm moving around as I need to.
[83:03.52]I actually might sell these ones.
[83:24.55]I'm going to sell the big ones.
[83:29.39]Come on.
[83:29.98]Come on.
[83:30.38]Where is it?
[83:33.70]Come on.
[83:35.98]It won't let me do it.
[83:36.90]It's so close.
[83:44.69]It's not going to let me do it.
[83:50.22]Let me sell this stuff.
[83:51.36]I know I'm not going to get a lot back, but it's worth it.
[84:16.54]What the hell are you doing in here?
[84:19.17]Oh, he's a worker.
[84:19.95]Okay.
[84:24.59]Can you get out?
[84:25.12]I don't want you to... That's much better.
[84:35.91]Now I have a lot more room to work with.
[84:39.00]Okay.
[84:39.12]Okay.
[84:54.64]I can't even do it all.
[84:56.63]How much more money do I need?
[85:09.40]Alright, the pool needs to be dead center.
[85:13.47]Which is right here-ish?
[85:17.41]Right here?
[85:17.85]A little bit further up.
[85:21.70]I'm on the way.
[85:27.65]right there okay but yeah it is definitely interesting to as you get older you will start to the word I'm looking for is not lose things in your head but you are you kind of do one of the reasons why I even had the Reddit shelf with all the stream stuff oh there's a baseball on there from the baseball stream there's the sign from dollhouse
[85:57.20]There's a Bugleberry Potion.
[85:58.66]There's a 3D Movie Maker.
[86:01.77]I have the 3D Movie Makers over here.
[86:05.05]Total Distortion.
[86:05.85]The Neverhood Soundtrack.
[86:06.79]I have a lot of stuff.
[86:07.49]It's mainly to just go look at it and go, oh yeah.
[86:12.84]Oh yeah!
[86:13.78]That was kind of interesting, wasn't it?
[86:19.49]He's losing his memories.
[86:24.84]No, it's a good reminder.
[86:32.62]How close can I actually... What's a baseball smell like?
[86:38.81]Ass.
[87:01.86]Getting there.
[87:07.62]I'm the Joker.
[87:09.59]I'm the Joker.
[87:48.37]That means you're the penguin?
[87:52.16]Hey, you don't have to come at me and tell me my own character philosophical train of thought, okay?
[88:01.46]I know that.
[88:35.49]What's your spirit animal?
[88:37.81]Um.
[88:42.92]I don't know.
[88:48.20]Probably like a gorilla.
[88:52.45]It's a gorilla.
[88:53.85]It's a chimpanzee.
[89:12.71]It's probably some kind of ape.
[89:31.02]Is this the right color?
[89:38.77]Why does that one look more like... Wait.
[89:41.67]It is that one.
[89:42.47]It's this one.
[89:53.99]We are apes, you idiot.
[90:00.12]You know how many different types of ape there are?
[90:02.32]We are a type of ape.
[90:19.27]That's like saying that a parrot's an eagle.
[90:40.09]No, it isn't.
[90:40.94]That's what I'm saying.
[90:52.14]This is... I'm not happy with this, by the way.
[91:10.21]But it is what it is.
[91:14.80]I'm gonna go buy Marketing.
[91:27.38]Where was it?
[91:27.92]It was in the store.
[91:33.47]Okay, poster.
[91:36.24]It's a hundred bucks for one of these.
[91:43.07]Okay, so where should I... I can put it up pretty much anywhere.
[91:45.07]I'm gonna do the whole neighborhood.
[92:17.21]Alright, this better be worth it.
[92:25.38]Okay.
[92:26.24]Marketing done.
[92:31.03]Basic drink vending machine research.
[92:40.97]Oh.
[92:42.45]Shit.
[92:43.31]I need different music.
[92:48.44]Uh, how about... I can't do different music.
[92:59.98]Sorry.
[93:01.96]I apologize.
[93:02.70]Yep.
[93:14.83]Sorry.
[93:17.64]You play Silksong?
[93:18.58]I have not.
[93:19.68]I did download it though.
[93:21.99]I did buy it.
[93:25.14]I've seen all these people play it.
[93:26.37]I've seen people going, dude, it's crazy.
[93:44.59]I might fire, uh, Lionel, whatever his name is.
[93:55.88]What brand hot dog?
[93:57.68]Uh, either Applegate or Nathan's.
[94:12.72]It works!
[94:29.10]Welcome to Cigaretteville!
[94:35.13]This is quite the marketing campaign from a cigarette company.
[94:40.38]Fun for the whole family!
[94:46.94]Go down the smooth, filtered cigarette slide.
[94:52.77]We guarantee you it'll be slick enough for you to not get burnt on your back.
[94:57.96]Or whatever.
[95:01.86]the smooth taste.
[95:06.39]I don't care about the lemonade.
[95:11.94]Oh, that's still funny.
[95:17.91]A pervert was just looking at a vandal.
[95:20.11]Where?
[95:33.65]I want hundreds of people going down these slides.
[95:39.58]Any more posters?
[95:49.99]Yeah, then this place just gets shut down.
[95:57.27]Well, technically we weren't advertising it.
[95:59.36]It was just the shape of the slide looked like a cigarette.
[96:02.56]It wasn't advertising.
[96:13.37]Didn't this guy say he wasn't a cigarette comedian?
[96:17.45]Yeah, I did.
[96:18.15]But you know what?
[96:19.11]It looked too stupid to not do it for one park day.
[96:25.84]You called it... I did... Okay, I called it Cigaretteville.
[96:29.58]Between you and me.
[96:30.64]Between us.
[96:43.82]such a fucked up name.
[96:45.56]That's such a fucked up name for a park.
[96:51.95]I can see that being a place in the 40s or 50s, though.
[96:55.79]Take the kids to Cigaretteville, where Mom and Dad can have plenty of cigarettes.
[96:59.88]And the kids can go down the slides and have the fun.
[97:01.96]There's a designated cigarette area.
[97:03.34]There's cigarette ice cream.
[97:06.25]Cigarette-flavored toast.
[97:15.76]Wasn't somebody drowning?
[97:23.87]No.
[97:29.04]Dude, I want like a baseball park hot dog right now.
[97:37.06]I pre-fired.
[97:38.12]No.
[97:38.20]I thought he was coming right over here.
[97:57.90]Take a ride down Menthol Mountain.
[98:07.50]That's a good one.
[98:13.09]Lemonade.
[98:26.43]There you go.
[98:28.40]Hot dog plane, yep.
[98:35.26]Why are you standing there like that?
[98:37.04]Oh.
[98:39.07]I have not caught very many cheaters.
[98:42.61]Honestly, I've not been paying that much attention.
[98:58.78]He's tired and he's resting?
[99:00.48]Bro!
[99:02.57]What do you want?
[99:03.39]Four hours adult slide.
[99:17.85]Okay.
[99:20.19]You don't want to slide?
[99:21.15]And you want to be here for six hours.
[99:22.34]You got it.
[99:23.64]How?
[99:23.88]You don't want to slide?
[99:25.32]Come on.
[99:31.33]The ashtray slides kind of seem like things you'd see on Jackass.
[99:36.30]It is.
[99:36.60]It is kind of like a Jackass set.
[99:48.21]And especially them crashing into each other.
[100:05.29]Dude, you smell.
[100:13.60]Just ice?
[100:14.20]Okay.
[100:19.11]I need to... Okay, basic drink vending machine.
[100:21.37]I think I'm almost at level four.
[100:24.58]Getting there.
[100:29.04]Alright, things look alright.
[100:30.61]It's a little dirty, but it's fine.
[100:34.57]I'll pick up some trash while I'm just hanging out.
[100:48.09]Are you the type of kid to run up a slide?
[100:49.63]I feel like every kid is the type of kid to run up a slide.
[101:03.44]I feel like that's where you first learn what gravity is.
[101:06.68]The rules of gravity apply to us all.
[101:09.91]I think it happens there.
[101:19.76]I can go down a slide.
[101:21.78]I go up the slide too.
[101:24.61]And then you cut to the emergency room.
[101:28.13]Of like your two front teeth fucking jammed in.
[101:34.83]I've been there.
[101:35.41]Somebody says I had this exact experience.
[101:51.94]OK, ones in chat if as you when you were a kid you had a face mushed in experience.
[102:00.65]Need if you can do a poll if you need to.
[102:14.68]Like something messed you up bad.
[102:18.05]I had at least five of those experiences.
[102:20.13]At least.
[102:37.59]Who's winning tonight?
[102:38.59]Who's playing tonight?
[102:41.30]What'd you say?
[102:41.78]I did...
[102:43.83]I didn't see who was playing.
[102:44.75]Who's playing?
[102:50.03]I got hit in the eye with a Beyblade.
[102:51.67]Yeah.
[102:52.42]And it probably smushed... Did it smush you face in?
[102:57.14]That probably wouldn't have smushed you face... No, it hit you in the eye.
[102:59.32]Yeah.
[103:02.10]See what I'm saying?
[103:11.37]Somebody who's drowning.
[103:12.69]I got it.
[103:17.04]I once rode my bike straight into a huge tree.
[103:33.63]Yeah.
[103:33.75]61% said they had a face-smushed-in experience.
[103:36.93]That's what I'm saying.
[103:50.26]Okay.
[103:52.19]Hot dog.
[103:57.18]Somebody puked.
[104:02.94]Do they give you more money if you do more condiments?
[104:05.25]I haven't really paid attention to that.
[104:20.29]I saw the evil face.
[104:21.23]A lot of people want... Oh my goodness.
[104:32.58]Who took that picture?
[104:54.04]Alright, if that was in real life, would you guys want to know that?
[105:02.01]If you smelled bad, it was actually green lines came out of you.
[105:08.46]I feel like it'd be pretty helpful, but then I think it would be disgusting because when you're out in public, you don't really know how somebody smells.
[105:18.68]You're kind of just walking around.
[105:20.74]If we actually got to see just how smelly everybody really was, I feel like it would be bad.
[105:25.17]I feel like it'd be mind ruining.
[105:30.43]You would scan across an entire public area and just see all these green clouds and be like, holy shit, wait, we all smell.
[105:39.45]Everybody stinks.
[105:45.31]Society would collapse.
[105:54.18]You would know not to leave the house.
[105:57.75]Unless it was gone.
[106:04.03]It might have people to have better hygiene.
[106:10.78]I really do wonder what would happen if there was a... The Great... The Great Stink Line Apocalypse.
[106:20.09]Do you know what I mean?
[106:21.31]What would happen?
[106:30.88]The Great Stink Cloud... Happening.
[106:40.74]Somebody said, bro, that's just a Smash Brothers tournament.
[106:46.44]Dude, come on.
[107:02.15]That got me.
[107:02.93]That got me good.
[107:03.57]That was like a stomach.
[107:06.41]That hit me in the chest.
[107:16.98]You can hold the mouse for mopping?
[107:18.55]Yeah.
[107:19.23]And a backseat Andy told me three or four days ago that I should click spam click.
[107:26.90]And then somebody said it's a rhythm and I'm like, alright, so I'll do the rhythm.
[107:40.59]That's funny.
[107:44.02]Will the stink clouds also apply to animals?
[107:47.59]yes okay animals would be an orange stink cloud humans would be green uh birds would be a blue stink cloud so you could be able to tell from a distance and then like like solvents and chemical smells would be like pink
[108:19.37]natural smells, flowers, would be yellow.
[108:28.58]There'd be so much stink stuff, so many clouds would be floating around.
[108:42.17]Somebody said that would fuck with the ecosystem.
[108:43.71]Isn't it already there?
[108:45.75]We just can't see it.
[108:46.64]Isn't it...
[108:48.65]Isn't it actually... Can't you see it?
[108:53.22]Somehow?
[108:54.82]It's actually there, isn't it?
[108:58.55]With dog vision.
[109:07.18]No, you can't.
[109:08.90]Wait, with dog vision?
[109:10.75]If you had dog vision, you'd be able to see stink clouds?
[109:25.86]That's video game logic?
[109:35.51]I'm just seeing somebody activate dog vision.
[109:39.93]And then they got this horrible display of like smelly people walking around.
[109:44.68]Like stink lines coming out of their armpits and shit.
[109:50.96]And like all horrible smells everywhere.
[109:58.60]That's in a dog's life.
[110:01.00]Oh, that's right.
[110:07.39]That was in a Ren and Stimpy episode?
[110:15.04]I think I'm out of here.
[110:19.24]I'm getting hungry.
[110:20.12]And I know I'm getting hungry.
[110:21.37]And the more we talk about this, the less my appetite gets.
[110:38.69]End of stream jump scare.
[110:39.93]Yeah, I kind of brought it up here.
[110:43.64]This game's fun.
[110:44.32]I will probably still play it.
[110:46.34]I think I'm going to try to get to at least a four star rating.
[110:51.23]We got our little concept over here that we're going to change immediately.
[110:55.84]Next time I stream, probably.
[110:59.63]We didn't do any horseman stuff today, but I know that there was an appetite for it.
[111:06.30]So we'll end up doing that at some point here soon.
[111:09.88]Let me look at the calendar.
[111:12.18]Next time you see me will be probably... Probably next week.
[111:18.47]Somewhere early next week.
[111:21.15]Somewhere in like the Tuesday-ish range, maybe.
[111:26.44]Monday, Tuesday-ish.
[111:34.17]I do want to show...
[111:37.96]I want to show some of these Atari games.
[111:39.98]I think they're fun.
[111:42.95]I'll pick a day next week and I'll show you some of the colloquial vision games in Atari games.
[112:03.47]When is your sponsor stream?
[112:05.71]I don't know.
[112:08.54]I gotta figure that out.
[112:13.54]There's a couple of things I could do.
[112:17.21]I'm thinking of which one of them I would even want to do.
[112:21.17]But definitely there's one that's coming probably the next few weeks.
[112:26.90]But I'll let you know.
[112:27.92]You'll know very well in advance, Dormer.
[112:34.47]Did you say collo... Yeah, the colloquial vision.
[112:39.24]That's how I always said it.
[112:43.40]So that's how I will always say it.
[112:45.99]I don't say calico vision, I say colloquial vision.
[112:49.95]Colloquial.
[112:53.14]Like this.
[112:59.11]Colloquial.
[113:00.25]The colloquial vision.
[113:07.83]Call locally a vision.
[113:17.00]Paint your roof, please.
[113:18.32]I will do that next time.
[113:19.42]Alright.
[113:19.64]See you guys later.
[113:21.72]Take care of yourselves.
[113:22.56]See you in a few days.
[113:23.31]See you on Monday or Tuesday.
[113:27.51]See you later.
[113:30.15]I still don't have an outro.
[113:32.03]I'll get on that too.
[113:35.48]Goodbye.
[113:42.16]That first game was really fun.
[113:43.16]I liked it a lot.
[113:49.60]Oh, also, yes.
[113:51.61]DougDoug, if you didn't catch it, I've talked about it a few times, but I want to keep it up because by the time I stream next, it will not be there anymore.
[113:59.53]There's an auction right now.
[114:01.14]DougDoug is doing a charity stream.
[114:02.94]He's doing a few charity streams in a row.
[114:04.84]It's a whole week of this.
[114:06.74]I think there's one or two days left.
[114:09.25]Two days left, I think.
[114:11.82]There is an auction, charity auction for Monterey Bay Aquarium.
[114:17.09]There's raffles for a bunch of cool stuff.
[114:19.21]There's auctions for a bunch of cool stuff.
[114:21.39]I have an item in the auction.
[114:24.54]The microphone that I used to play Seaman, the Dreamcast microphone, the original one that I used on stream.
[114:31.75]I signed it.
[114:32.93]It's up for auction right now.
[114:39.29]The last time we looked at it, it looked like there was some bids on it.
[114:46.70]Yeah, is DougDoug live right now?
[114:48.31]That's probably a good thing to do.
[114:50.85]Just so I'm sure he'll show it, maybe.
[114:53.03]He did show it once or twice already, and he's been talking about it, so.
[114:56.32]Yeah, let's rate DougDoug.
[114:58.14]But I got an item on there.
[115:01.50]I think the auction closes at the end of the event, at the end of the charity event.
[115:06.85]So I think there's another day or two to bid on it if you want it.
[115:09.67]It is just the Dreamcast microphone.
[115:11.87]It's just the... Well, you can go look at it.
[115:14.76]There it is right there.
[115:18.50]I signed it.
[115:19.44]DougDoug, it is in DougDoug's possession.
[115:22.18]And he will send it to you.
[115:24.53]But, see you later.
[115:26.11]Go support DougDoug and everything he's doing.
[115:31.07]And I will see you jokers another time.
[115:36.23]See you later.
[116:48.47]you
