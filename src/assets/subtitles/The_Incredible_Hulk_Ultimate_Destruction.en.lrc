[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.04]I didn't guarantee that, right?
[00:03.80]Did I 100% guarantee that I was gonna be here at 3.58 Pacific?
[00:07.76]I don't remember.
[00:08.28]I did?
[00:10.38]Did I?
[00:10.90]It was a 100% guarantee.
[00:16.53]Shit.
[00:17.63]Well, whatever.
[00:18.63]I'm here now, and that's all that matters.
[00:19.97]We're here now.
[00:20.41]What do you mean, link it?
[00:25.63]Link it, link it, screen cap it.
[00:27.11]Screen cap what?
[00:29.17]I will start at the latest 358 Pacific, and then I said screen cap this.
[00:35.64]Well, what?
[00:38.58]Screen cap it.
[00:41.36]Okay.
[00:42.98]So what?
[00:43.32]You screen capped it, and you proved me wrong.
[00:50.99]You got me.
[00:52.41]Hey, guess what?
[00:53.99]You got me.
[00:56.31]By the way, can I just say, how do I sound?
[01:00.00]Don't you think this is an immense improvement from the last time you heard me talk?
[01:05.21]I mean, an immense improvement.
[01:14.15]worse.
[01:14.71]Get out of here.
[01:15.53]I spent like 45 minutes making sure this sounded good.
[01:18.99]I had the things in my ears and I was leaning forward just being like, hello, hello.
[01:24.10]Good afternoon.
[01:24.88]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[01:28.00]It sounds fucking clean.
[01:31.62]You should try whispering.
[01:33.14]No.
[01:34.18]Why would I do that?
[01:34.94]I'm not gonna do that.
[01:37.15]No one cares.
[01:38.45]Oh, right.
[01:39.47]Hold on.
[01:39.85]We'll go over this.
[01:42.61]Interesting, uh,
[01:44.88]Interesting week.
[01:46.54]Interesting few weeks, to be honest.
[01:50.73]All the stuff, all the moving, everything that happened with the dog.
[01:54.51]I said I didn't want to take any more extended time off, but that...
[01:59.77]Ended up not being the case, and somebody just gave $100.
[02:02.61]We had 10 community subs from LMMan, 5 community subs from SoyDev, and then $100 from Gimme20Dollars.
[02:14.10]Why didn't you give me $20?
[02:17.00]Your name, Gimme20Dollars, gave me 10,000 bits.
[02:23.88]You went way over what you were supposed to give me.
[02:27.37]No, does that mean I'm supposed to give you $20?
[02:29.20]Is that how that works?
[02:31.64]Anyways, we are here after an interesting week.
[02:35.97]Those who don't know, I'll go over it briefly after I tweet this.
[02:39.19]So just relax for a second.
[03:21.24]Okay.
[03:22.60]I just had to tweet that.
[03:24.10]It's going to be hard to drink this.
[03:25.15]I'm going to dump this all over my nice microphone.
[03:26.97]It's a nice microphone.
[03:27.87]Can you tell?
[03:28.83]Did you tell that I got a nice microphone?
[03:32.43]You couldn't.
[03:32.77]Let me get a little closer.
[03:35.06]Anyways, let me see.
[03:36.18]People made get well cards for Otto, which is very, very nice.
[03:39.68]Very sweet of you.
[03:41.76]I'll go over the story real quick.
[03:43.62]So, Otto, four or five days ago now, whatever it was, he was going outside to go pee all the time.
[03:52.44]I was like, what is going on?
[03:54.10]He's going outside every five, ten minutes.
[03:56.03]He needs to pee every ten minutes.
[03:57.19]I'm like, this is not right.
[03:59.71]And just because I was curious, after like the seventh or eighth time in two hours or so of him just peeing, peeing, peeing, peeing, peeing, I'm like, you know what?
[04:09.37]Let me just put like a paper towel underneath.
[04:12.52]when he pees.
[04:13.48]So he went for like the 10th time, whatever, he goes out and pees, and I put the paper towel under, and there's blood on the paper towel.
[04:20.46]He's peeing blood.
[04:22.62]At that point, you know, you have a fucking meltdown.
[04:25.22]You're like, what is that?
[04:26.30]Why is he doing that?
[04:27.55]What's going on?
[04:29.23]and I just I just brought him to the emergency room I brought him to the vet and thankfully they did a couple of tests and it turned out he doesn't have his like blood work was okay his his kidney was function was okay and they did a x-ray of his abdomen to see if there's any growths or tumors or anything and thankfully nothing there either
[04:52.47]But he had to go on antibiotics.
[04:54.09]They thought he had a UTI.
[04:56.29]And if you don't know this, Otto has Addison's.
[05:01.02]So what Otto cannot produce is steroids.
[05:03.80]His body physically can't do it.
[05:06.13]There's a spectrum of steroid diseases.
[05:09.99]You can either have Cushing's or you can have Addison's.
[05:12.09]Cushing's is way too much steroids.
[05:14.45]Addison's is not very many or none at all.
[05:17.31]So he needs to get, every month he gets an injection.
[05:21.20]And he has to get steroids every month.
[05:22.96]And every other day or so, depending on how stressful the situations are, he has to take steroids.
[05:29.53]Now, because of the move, it's been very, very stressful for him.
[05:35.25]Obviously, because we moved to a new place.
[05:37.59]So he's been very stressed out.
[05:40.67]You know, what's this new place I'm in?
[05:44.39]I don't like this.
[05:46.03]You brought me to a new place.
[05:48.15]And it's hard for dogs to kind of acclimate.
[05:52.31]And a dog that has Addison's, they think, at least the vet thinks, that he...
[05:58.56]Over the stress from the move and not producing, he gave himself a UTI.
[06:02.91]Essentially is what I was told.
[06:05.07]But he's doing alright now.
[06:08.49]He is back to high spirits.
[06:09.93]He's running around.
[06:11.07]He's almost done with his antibiotics.
[06:12.43]And I just wanted to take the time over the last few days to make sure that he was alright.
[06:19.31]Because obviously when he's peeing every 10 minutes, somebody's got to be here to make sure he can go out and we can take care of him, make sure there's no blood.
[06:27.86]So that's why I was gone for like another five days.
[06:30.78]So sorry that I was gone.
[06:33.24]I really don't mean for this shit to happen.
[06:35.20]It's just kind of bad timing.
[06:36.78]Because I come back like last week or so and I'm like, okay, we're going to be doing four streams a week at least.
[06:42.75]And I'm going to be here every day.
[06:44.65]See you later.
[06:44.99]I'll see you in a week.
[06:47.48]So, I do apologize for that.
[06:50.28]But... We can go over how this is going to play out here over the next... Seven or eight days.
[06:56.26]Because, obviously, that happened.
[07:00.42]You probably noticed the title.
[07:02.20]Hulk Ultimate Destruction has come in.
[07:05.21]And that supersedes literally everything else.
[07:08.15]I was under the impression that Hulk Ultimate Destruction wasn't going to come in for another week or two.
[07:14.93]So...
[07:16.96]I've decided I want to play Hulk.
[07:19.17]I hope I got the right one.
[07:20.39]And there's a funny story with this one, too.
[07:22.17]I'm full of stories today.
[07:24.95]Let's just move over so you can see it.
[07:27.39]Anyways.
[07:30.69]So, Hulk Ultimate Destruction.
[07:32.28]I bought this for GameCube.
[07:35.50]And I didn't get the GameCube one.
[07:40.06]I got the one for Xbox.
[07:42.04]So, I bought the one for GameCube and I got sent the Xbox, the regular Xbox One.
[07:47.87]So thankfully I have a 360 and it can play Xbox games.
[07:53.53]If I didn't own an Xbox or a 360, I would be probably pretty mad right now.
[07:59.18]Is this the right one?
[07:59.92]What do you mean the wrong game?
[08:05.42]The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction.
[08:10.00]8.9 out of 10 from Xbox Magazine.
[08:11.82]This is the right game.
[08:14.34]Wait, hold on.
[08:14.90]Is it, it's not, is it Hulk Ultimate Destruction?
[08:18.84]Or it's not The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction?
[08:21.70]This is wrong?
[08:28.58]No, it's not.
[08:29.62]That would be the dumbest thing ever.
[08:31.46]If you made a game called Hulk Ultimate Destruction, and then somebody else made it The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction, there's a lawsuit there somewhere.
[08:39.59]That's stupid.
[08:40.85]No, this is the right fucking game.
[08:44.37]Anyways, that's what we're gonna do today and maybe tomorrow depending how much fun I have playing this and We have to have much more a lot more money come first of all 10 community subs I said it but I wanted but I don't want to just skip it 10 subs it's a lot of money from LM man 5 from soy dev $100 from give me $20 $200 from fatal finale 220,000 bits and they say auto healthy

[09:35.31]Alright, it's been a long week.
[09:38.06]I feel like I've said it's been a long week.

[10:54.17]It's not fun.
[10:55.65]I really appreciate all the support and everybody that said all the nice things.

[11:45.88]Difficulty, easy or normal?
[11:47.36]You're gonna make me look bad if I pick easy, so I'll do normal.
[11:50.30]Thanks a lot, guys, seriously.
[11:52.34]Opening cutscene, I'm gonna be quiet, and by that I'll probably, maybe for the first 10 seconds I'll be quiet, and then I'll be like, guys, this is what happened to me today.
[11:59.89]That's what happens every time, right?
[12:01.65]Not this time.
[12:11.00]There's a thin line between good and bad.
[12:12.92]Guys, you know how long my Ethernet cable is right now?
[12:15.46]Every single day.
[12:18.00]When I stray from it, people die.
[12:23.41]My name is Bruce Banner.
[12:25.71]And this is me.
[12:28.91]This is me.
[12:29.69]I'm the Hulk.
[12:33.43]I did this to myself.
[12:34.99]All in the name of science.
[12:36.97]Is this game any good?
[12:38.35]Were you guys lying to me?
[12:39.17]Is this game terrible?
[12:40.17]This is me.
[12:41.87]And all that I've become.
[12:44.27]I'm a big, green time bomb.
[12:48.92]And I'm ticking.
[12:50.84]They have to look like GTA 5.
[12:52.76]That was just a GTA 5.
[12:54.20]That's a GTA 5.
[12:55.04]The same graphics.
[13:01.09]Branson Military Base, present day.
[13:05.63]Is this where I punch a building once and it explodes?
[13:11.78]PR?
[13:13.07]Welcome to the Hulk survival program.
[13:15.03]What?
[13:15.31]In this series of exercises, you will approximate Hulk's basic abilities.
[13:19.19]Someone's playing... Wait a minute.
[13:21.55]Someone's playing a VR game of the Hulk of me controlling the Hulk in an Xbox game.
[13:29.20]Is it following that?
[13:32.10]Try running into various obstacles here to get a sense of the creature's power.
[13:36.79]While this is merely a virtual representation of the beast... It's not that impressive.
[13:40.45]...be reminded that Hulk is actually capable of most feats demonstrated here.
[13:45.63]Oh, hold R. Another example of Hulk's immense strength.
[13:49.44]He seems capable of picking up virtually any object in his path.
[13:53.58]Cool!
[13:53.92]Approach any object and press the grab-throw control to lift it.
[13:58.51]Okay, that's a... Am I gonna lose, like, the mech warrior stuff on the HUD on the screen?
[14:05.95]Holy shit, that was insane.
[14:09.42]A is jump.
[14:11.28]Pressing X once performs a basic attack.
[14:13.02]Use X, X, X to do three punch combo.
[14:16.00]This is already more fun than the last one.
[14:17.96]Pressing the special button will activate Hulk's more advanced techniques, unleashing everything he's got.
[14:25.36]These will often launch or stun.
[14:27.52]Knee smash, uppercut.
[14:29.01]As with Hulk's other techniques, holding the button will increase the power of each technique.
[14:35.05]It is vitally important you research Hulk's various combat abilities.
[14:39.19]Wait, it's like X, X, Y?
[14:40.01]Y, X, X. This is cool.
[14:40.55]This sounds too low in the game.
[14:42.07]Should I blast it?
[15:06.87]Alright, let's ultimate destroy, right?
[15:13.03]Did that guy just say game on?
[15:18.11]Wait, can I hold jump down?
[15:24.37]You guy gave me a 10.
[15:28.54]I shouldn't have killed him.
[15:41.28]Ooh, a cow.
[15:44.77]Oh, God.
[15:45.27]That was horrible.
[15:48.79]Okay, I don't want to do that again.
[15:51.03]I don't want to kill cows.
[15:53.77]Alright, let's do a mission.
[16:01.98]This is just a sprint?
[16:03.10]This is sprint really fast.
[16:04.38]Okay.
[16:09.05]Why am I the only one that played this game as a kid?
[16:12.67]Now you learn how to... I thought that just said regret.
[16:14.89]Now you learn how to target and attack enemies by throwing objects at them.
[16:17.74]Helicopters will fly around and just get them.
[16:19.64]Once the beast has located a perceived threat, he will launch objects with no regard for human life.
[16:26.56]Tap or hold the designated grab throw button to launch an object at your target.
[16:32.44]These guys don't even care.
[16:33.84]Can I sneak up on these guys?
[16:47.65]Holy shit!
[16:50.91]Okay, look at helicopter.
[16:52.29]Pull and hold L to target the helicopter.
[16:54.93]Okay, throw.
[16:55.55]This is stupid.
[17:06.72]I got it.
[17:08.96]That was not effective.
[17:09.99]Can I grab another helicopter to throw helicopter at the other helicopter?
[17:18.25]Whoa.
[17:22.52]Alright, let's go.
[17:23.74]Where's helicopter?
[17:25.16]Holy shit, that was destructive.
[17:29.48]It's almost like I can feel the Hulk hands.
[17:35.10]These can be thrown with devastating power and accuracy.
[17:38.36]Okay.
[17:39.40]For targets at great distances, pressing and holding the grab-throw button will hit targets at greater distances.
[17:47.93]Oh, I see s- You can switch targets while in targeting mode.
[17:52.59]Or get a helicopter, okay.
[18:02.14]This game makes you really feel like Hulk.
[18:05.79]Why did he curve?
[18:06.97]Why are these guys ping pong balls?
[18:12.84]Alright, let's just get out of this tutorial.
[18:19.06]They're homing.
[18:20.84]This is fun.
[18:23.40]I think I'm gonna like this game.
[18:24.64]Now I understand why you guys told me I bought the wrong one.
[18:26.88]Oh, come on!
[18:39.33]Was that a rollercoaster tycoon rollercoaster?
[18:41.21]What was that?
[18:42.71]That guy went far.
[18:45.23]Okay, I want to keep going.
[18:49.51]This is fucking loud.
[19:02.30]He's a strong one!
[19:08.18]Look out!
[19:11.08]That's so... Oh god.
[19:13.96]There's not a pigeon in the road, man.
[19:15.66]This dude's throwing shit.
[19:17.87]He's throwing whole tankers at you.
[19:27.67]Need one more helicopter?
[19:28.57]This one's pre-recorded.
[19:33.19]Stop blowing my fucking cover, dude.
[19:37.80]Got it.

[23:16.73]I'm a fucking streamer.
[23:17.77]This is a redditor room This is a redditor office alright relax relax everybody this is a redditor office
[23:35.41]No, it is not.
[23:36.47]Redditors don't even fucking like Pac-Man.
[23:39.53]If, alright, if The Witcher, if I had like a Geralt statue up there, I would agree with you.
[23:44.39]That's fucking Blinky, Stinky, Guppy, and, and, and, uh, Bruto.
[23:49.53]Okay?
[23:50.27]That's not a Redditor shelf.
[23:54.06]Geraldo.
[24:02.03]Alright, I gotta fucking read this shit.
[24:03.49]You're distracting the fuck out of me.
[24:05.29]Eggscramble just gave $50.
[24:07.27]It's not a Reddit shelf.
[24:14.57]No, no, I'm sorry.
[24:16.89]Qbert, you think Redditors care about Qbert?
[24:19.86]Or Roger Rabbit?
[24:22.28]Okay, I'll give you Carnage.
[24:23.66]But I liked Carnage before Reddit did.
[24:25.88]Fuck, I gotta stop saying that.
[24:27.95]Slimer.
[24:28.77]I liked Slimer before Reddit was even a website.
[24:31.45]That's my favorite Ghostbusters character.
[24:33.33]That shit was 1987.
[24:35.85]Okay?
[24:36.43]Reddit didn't come out till like 95.
[24:38.51]So please.
[24:38.93]I'm a huge Slimer fan.
[24:43.76]And by the way, that's the rare... That's the rare pog.
[24:47.36]What are they called?
[24:47.94]Pog with pops?
[24:49.32]That's the rare pop.
[24:50.44]That's Slimer with the hot dogs in his mouth.
[24:51.98]That thing's worth like $400.
[24:55.79]I bought it for 500, but I thought it was going to keep appreciating and it didn't.
[24:59.00]It went down in price a little bit, but it's still worth $400.
[25:06.92]Nice apartment, man.
[25:08.16]Hold on.
[25:12.62]Okay, you make me want to get one of these.
[25:15.26]You make me want to get one of these.
[25:16.64]I think I want to get one of these.
[25:18.20]That'd be so stupid.
[25:19.40]Imagine having like a Pepsi fucking vending machine in your office.
[25:25.03]That would be so annoying.
[25:27.13]And I would pay it.
[25:27.83]I would put money in it and shit.
[25:41.78]That's so small.
[25:45.78]I'm going to get one of those.
[25:46.44]I'm going to get like an old Pepsi machine.
[25:48.30]I have to put money in it and press the button and it's wicked loud.
[25:54.51]And, I'm sorry, a Gumby sofa?
[25:58.25]You wouldn't have a Gumby sofa in your house?
[26:00.95]What's wrong with you?
[26:02.75]Why?
[26:03.23]Why would you not want a... I don't care if you're 12 or 80.
[26:08.06]That's fucking awesome.
[26:17.38]Alright.
[26:20.20]If you're 35 and you still get to play Pokémon, then I get to be 35 and have a Q-Bert pup, okay?
[26:29.42]That's how it works.
[26:36.55]None of us are doing it?
[26:37.21]Yes, you are.
[26:43.45]Alright, I got another fucking huge amount of money just came in.
[26:48.49]Guys, I haven't even done the first part of the tutorial in Hulk.
[26:54.85]Thank you, Egg Scramble.
[26:55.87]They say that's $50 from Egg Scramble.
[26:58.76]Mmm, yummy bits, yum.
[26:59.94]Please pass the Parmesan.
[27:01.34]Parmesan in eggs is actually really, really good.
[27:04.10]You take the eggs, beat up your eggs, like three or four of them, add some pepper, add a splash of milk, and put in a bunch of Parmesan cheese.
[27:13.69]Go...
[27:19.57]Until they're nice and smooth.
[27:21.35]And then make scrambled eggs.
[27:23.01]They're delicious.
[27:24.01]Trust me.
[27:29.57]If you don't believe me, try it once and then don't ever do it again.
[27:32.06]But then I'll be right.
[27:32.70]It's okay.
[27:34.60]Anyways, thanks for the $50.
[27:35.44]Thanks for the $50 fucking dollars from Phylactery Lich.
[27:39.60]5,000 bits.
[27:41.58]This is an R slash male living space.
[27:45.20]Earn those Funko Pops.
[27:46.53]Omega.
[27:46.81]It's the only ones I have.
[27:49.99]What do you mean burn those Funko Pops?
[27:51.67]Roger Rabbit, that's a fucking rare one.
[27:54.49]You can't even buy that one anymore.
[27:56.15]I knew I shouldn't have fucking shown you these.
[27:58.31]I have four Funko Pops.
[28:00.47]Oh, wow.
[28:01.09]I don't have a fucking closet full of these things.
[28:03.81]I don't have like 300 of them.
[28:05.82]They're just like, they were like, okay, over the last like six years, I've gotten four.
[28:12.57]If you have less than 10 Funko Pops, that's fine.
[28:15.84]More than 20?
[28:17.44]You need a space for it.
[28:18.42]And if you don't, that's a little too much after 20, 30.
[28:21.14]Who has space for that?
[28:23.02]I got four.
[28:23.62]I have to play the game.
[28:28.35]Before people start to get mad at me.
[28:34.91]Make it zero.
[28:35.73]Zero.
[28:40.20]I'm not going to make it.
[28:41.38]Why?
[28:41.86]They're like... They're fine.
[28:46.59]What's this one?
[28:47.95]Okay.
[28:51.17]A series of markers will appear above the base... Okay, this is jump.
[28:54.25]Cool.
[29:07.98]Okay, yeah, so you can jump.
[29:09.58]Jumping is cool.
[29:10.34]Jumping works.
[29:12.04]Here we go.
[29:20.79]Is this his primary ability?
[29:22.95]I mean, is it?
[29:24.07]I guess.
[29:30.05]Is this a cow?
[29:31.72]Why is he making like... You know, find somebody that can make a good cow noise.
[29:38.81]You can't.
[29:39.19]It's really hard to do that.
[29:41.73]Everybody always does like a... No.
[29:46.27]Dude, a cow actually goes like... Nobody can do it.
[29:50.83]It didn't go... It's the white stain in your office.
[30:04.50]What the fuck are you talking about?
[30:14.69]Yeah, you can charge.
[30:15.45]Charge.
[30:17.55]Can I get all the markers?
[30:18.33]Yeah.
[30:19.91]Alright, final tutorial incoming.
[30:24.41]Jerma on face cam be like.
[30:25.75]What the fuck is this?
[30:26.87]Grow.
[30:27.39]It's grow time.
[30:29.04]Grow time.
[30:29.66]Grow time.
[30:30.36]Grow time.
[30:34.04]Um.
[30:36.20]The hell is this?
[30:39.26]Why is this so high quality?
[31:01.29]Are you going to go on a rant yet?
[31:02.55]No.
[31:03.07]Alright, half of you guys want me to go off on a fucking rant.
[31:07.70]And the other half want to see Hulk Ultimate Destruction.
[31:10.20]No, I'm going to play.
[31:16.62]Two of 60 comic books.
[31:20.14]Oh, cool.
[31:20.68]Extras.
[31:20.98]Alright, what's the last thing that it wants me to know?
[31:25.89]Hulk can climb and run up walls.
[31:27.83]Oh, he can run up walls.
[31:28.55]I didn't know that.
[31:32.71]If I can run up walls, good thing I... Do I have to hold the whole time?
[31:37.93]No, I don't.
[31:38.51]Holy shit, this is actually kind of cool.
[31:45.05]I got this from... This is like a Spider-Man ability.
[31:49.06]Alright, let's go.
[31:54.12]Time to play the game.
[31:54.72]It's only been 30 minutes, guys.
[32:01.39]You already ranted about Funko Pops.
[32:03.17]You can run.
[32:05.53]Oh god.
[32:06.01]It's kind of hard to control.
[32:17.78]That was sick, Hulk.
[32:22.84]Don't say cool, say pog instead.
[32:27.22]No, I'm 35.
[32:31.48]You might be, like, under the age of 30 or 25 or something.
[32:34.29]And that's, like, fine.
[32:35.29]But my generation says cool or sick.
[32:38.71]Pog.
[32:39.89]Right?
[32:40.33]No, I get it.
[32:42.59]Pick up a missile pack from the roof of the building.
[32:49.25]Missile pack?
[32:52.75]And then weaponize it.
[32:56.74]Wait, I...
[33:04.56]This is so stupid.
[33:11.27]Why don't I just shoot?
[33:12.31]Just use it as a rocket launcher.
[33:14.19]Oh, because I have to... I get it.
[33:15.41]I was going to say, why am I not just using it, like shooting it out of my shoulder?
[33:19.05]Oh!
[33:27.04]Hulk's ability to apply his incredible strength to create new powerful weapons.
[33:30.20]Spend your smash points to unlock the many and varied weapons.
[33:32.96]Cool.
[33:33.22]Alright, let's go.
[33:34.48]I'm done.
[33:40.58]Smash points?
[33:41.12]Okay, this grow time thing is over here.
[33:42.66]What is that even from?
[33:43.78]Is that like a Fruit of the Loom commercial?
[33:50.31]You've unlocked a cheat code.
[33:53.44]O Canada.
[33:55.58]Once Hulk has acquired an object, the creature will frequently manipulate it to fashion a makeshift weapon, such as a missile.
[34:03.97]If Hulk uses B to grapple an enemy of his size or smaller using B again will throw him.
[34:08.66]Oh yeah, I can grab a- Really?
[34:09.52]I need a car.
[34:10.58]Weaponize it!
[34:32.50]Weaponize this.
[34:34.94]Oh, this is technically not a car.
[34:36.64]I need a car.
[34:39.96]I feel like this game is going to be a blast.
[34:46.10]Is this a car?
[34:48.26]No, it's also like a truck.
[34:49.48]There's only trucks.
[34:51.58]Okay.
[34:57.51]There we go.
[34:58.11]There are the Hulk hands.
[34:59.41]Actual Hulk hands.
[35:03.57]Why does Hulk need Hulk hands?
[35:07.29]That doesn't make any sense.
[35:08.17]Alright, let's go.
[35:18.81]I'm out.
[35:25.75]It's to make you stronger.
[35:28.91]Alright, I'm starting to get the feel for that one.
[35:35.48]We found Comic Book 4!
[35:36.68]It's a movie!
[35:38.24]Speaking of movies, here comes a cutscene.
[35:41.52]It's been 40 minutes.
[35:44.62]Return to the bug menu.
[35:46.08]Save.
[35:47.16]Hard... Xbox hard disk.
[35:51.02]Alright, should we... Let's go.
[35:59.93]Oh, by the way, how's the internet?
[36:01.57]Hey, how's the internet?
[36:05.34]Are we good?
[36:06.24]Hmm.
[36:06.34]Cool.
[36:06.54]For those of you that don't know, does anyone want to link the fucking Giazio?
[36:14.00]We got fucking fiber.
[36:19.35]That's right.
[36:19.87]We're on fiber now, folks.
[36:24.23]I've been trying to get fiber for five years, and I finally fucking have it.
[36:28.01]Oh, out getting some fresh air.
[36:30.33]Oh, I'm glad one of us was.
[36:31.53]Alright, listen to me.
[36:32.82]I've intercepted a transmission coming out of Branson Military Base.
[36:36.62]Some spook named Blonsky's taking charge.
[36:38.68]They're planning a major foray in your direction as we speak.
[36:42.36]Bruce, he's requisitioned half the men and supplies on the base.
[36:45.12]They know you're out there and they're coming for you.
[36:48.18]I want you to come back into town and lay low for a while.
[36:50.85]You're in real danger out there.
[36:52.39]When, if I came into town, everyone would be in danger.
[36:55.39]Bruce, as your doctor, I'm urging you to reconsider.
[36:59.29]Your health's deteriorating by the hour.
[37:03.69]Give him an Attack on Titan's stomach.
[37:07.44]And, like, pull his hairline back, like, a tenth of, like, maybe, like, a half an inch.
[37:12.29]Make him back long.
[37:14.51]And roll his shoulders forward.
[37:26.93]Wait, he's in there?
[37:27.97]Why does he feel like a Gmod map?
[37:30.04]This is a Gmod horror map.
[37:31.02]Oh shit.
[37:31.24]Don't stand behind it.
[37:56.92]I was in there?
[37:57.62]That's a small little shack.
[37:59.62]Get to the jump marker and use it to escape.
[38:02.46]Let's go.
[38:28.48]Whenever an enemy is defeated, you get smash points.
[38:31.96]Power-ups are also spawned.
[38:33.04]Wait, you collect these?
[38:36.50]Power-ups are also spawned.
[38:37.90]Do I have to collect them?
[38:40.27]Hulk has collected a power-up.
[38:41.57]Keep track of Hulk's health using power meter.
[38:49.25]You can move much more quickly by using R to make Hulk run.
[38:53.55]Maximum speed can be attained by pulling and holding down R rather than tapping it.
[38:57.73]Okay.
[38:58.65]Sure.
[39:00.13]Can I get a tree?
[39:02.09]Yup.
[39:08.39]Okay, that was kind of dumb.
[39:11.19]Grandma, wait, I'm getting food.
[39:12.29]Well, hurry up!
[39:13.77]Don't hurry up.
[39:14.93]Slow down.
[39:15.29]I'm gonna spear this person.
[39:19.55]Wait, you... Get it slow.
[39:25.43]Don't rush.
[39:28.93]Pause the game.
[39:30.55]What?
[39:30.79]What the fuck?
[39:37.54]Pause.
[39:37.84]What?
[39:42.01]This is, you know how fast it takes to heat up even like a bowl of Easy Mac?
[39:45.59]It's like at least three or four minutes.
[39:47.37]No, we don't have time for that.
[39:51.81]Get to the jump mark.
[39:55.23]I missed.
[39:59.24]There we go.
[40:01.12]Nice.
[40:02.62]Just run through people, that's a... Why even, why even, wait, no, no, I want the power points, right?
[40:09.34]Okay.
[40:13.17]As an alternative to throwing, use X while Hulk is an enemy to do an attack on them.
[40:21.60]Cool.
[40:25.38]Well, now you're dead.
[40:26.02]I actually have to run into the power points, don't I?
[40:35.94]Just pick up the tank and throw it.
[40:37.30]Done.
[40:42.13]Certain enemies are armored.
[40:43.57]Uncharged attacks will not damage an armored opponent.
[40:45.91]You must charge your attacks to be able to damage armored opponents.
[40:48.73]Tanks are always armored.
[40:58.28]Why is this moving so fast?
[41:04.02]Cover the what?
[41:04.91]Come on.
[41:10.73]Stop it!
[41:13.61]Where, where, where, where, where?
[41:21.40]Can I catch the missiles?
[41:34.87]Why?
[41:35.13]There's like too much...
[41:38.07]Where are... I can?
[41:40.59]I'm gonna catch a missile.
[41:41.39]Let's try.
[41:43.57]Alright, let me... What the fuck is happening?
[41:47.67]I just feel like I'm playing on a battlefield 64 versus 64.
[41:54.89]Catch it.
[41:58.53]Oh, there's the tank.
[41:59.71]I'm gonna die.
[42:17.17]He's bad.
[42:18.13]I mean, I guess.
[42:19.61]Can I throw these?
[42:21.01]Don't stay initially explosive.
[42:32.52]Nice.
[42:32.84]Wait, I can get powerups.
[42:33.84]Throw shit.
[42:39.92]The movement's actually pretty fucking fluid, right?
[42:48.46]No, I don't want to throw to you.
[42:53.88]Alright, I'm just going to run.
[42:55.06]Who cares?
[42:57.95]No, I have to kill one tank.
[43:01.33]No, I don't.
[43:01.97]Who cares?
[43:08.21]It doesn't matter.
[43:09.04]I just have to go.
[43:10.34]What happened?
[43:18.09]You're dying to tanks.
[43:19.05]Yeah, because they're strong.
[43:26.49]What?
[43:28.79]Why are they getting health?
[43:30.97]I got it.
[43:31.52]Oh, good.
[43:31.82]Power-ups.
[43:33.22]There we go.
[43:40.34]I know what it is.
[43:40.96]I know what it is.
[43:41.36]I've been trying to figure it out.
[43:42.30]I've been trying to find out what the fucking sound is that Hulk is making over and over again.
[43:46.26]And I haven't said anything about it because I didn't want to fuck up the stream.
[43:50.33]It's Diablo II Diablo boss sounds when you attack Diablo.
[43:55.11]They're like... I've just been waiting to figure it out.
[43:59.67]I figured it out.
[44:02.35]When the Hulk's power reaches critical masses, rage feeds his strength.
[44:06.93]Later, you'll be able to buy some devastating special attacks that are fueled by your critical mass.
[44:10.76]Am I at critical mass?
[44:12.78]I like that one the best.
[44:14.04]Let's go.
[44:32.23]Stop.
[44:32.69]No, it's called Hulk Ultimate Destruction.
[44:35.89]Not Hulk Be Gentle.
[44:38.97]Well, that would be pretty fun.
[44:40.61]That would be kind of a fun game, don't you think?
[44:42.85]Where the fuck am I going?
[44:44.93]What the fuck is going on?
[44:52.12]I made it to the drop zone.
[44:56.14]Let's go!
[45:08.91]I'm at critical mass.
[45:12.05]Why do I have to power up?
[45:13.17]Okay, I get it.
[45:18.39]Another $50.
[45:19.59]Holy shit.
[45:23.12]So much money.
[45:25.52]This is just the beginning.
[45:28.90]I hope you're satisfied, Blonsky.
[45:31.04]The Hulk got away.
[45:32.52]He'll turn up.
[45:33.96]He's a freak and a conspicuous one.
[45:37.23]I'm more concerned with what Banner left behind.
[45:40.39]There.
[45:41.61]I want that bio container before it's destroyed.
[45:44.43]Careful, Blonsky.
[45:46.05]You have no idea what you're playing.
[45:49.15]No!
[45:49.29]No, then doesn't he become Other Hulk?
[45:50.83]Banner left his toys in the playground, and I'm not about to watch them burn.
[45:56.16]Yeah, he turns into Hulk.
[45:57.18]Yeah, he turns into Hulk, Other Hulk.
[45:59.94]Orange Hulk, right?
[46:00.82]Whatever his name is.
[46:01.44]The Abominable Snowman.
[46:04.74]Uh, Mega Agro gave 5,000 bits.
[46:06.52]$50.
[46:06.60]That's a lot of fucking money.
[46:10.53]Dermot, don't listen to chat.
[46:11.37]Your office looks comfy, and I hope the rest of the place is too.
[46:14.43]Long time fan since 2013.
[46:16.03]Yada, yada, yada, blah, blah, blah.
[46:18.11]I love ya.
[46:18.91]Also hope Otto feels better.
[46:20.06]He's a good boy.
[46:20.80]I wasn't just skipping that.
[46:21.90]That was in the message.
[46:23.12]So that's not me being rude.
[46:25.34]That's in the message.
[46:27.34]I appreciate that.
[46:27.96]Thank you.
[46:28.38]That is comfy.
[46:40.44]They took the machine from me.
[46:42.64]It was the only chance I had.
[46:43.82]I didn't have anywhere else to go.
[46:46.34]Does the Hulk not have nipples?
[46:47.65]Okay, follow me, quickly.
[46:50.35]You should have come here sooner, Bruce.
[46:52.01]Look, I know, and I'm sorry.
[46:54.39]The sickness is getting worse.
[46:56.13]I think the Hulk's trying to break away from me, and I don't know how long I'll be able to contain it.
[47:07.17]I don't understand the Jean shorts, by the way.
[47:09.35]Why wouldn't you just wear, like, spandex?
[47:10.45]Like, really stretchy spandex underwear, and that's it.
[47:11.75]Why do I have to do VR?
[47:41.29]Ultimate Destruction, is it just like VR, or do I actually do Ultimate Destruction?
[47:51.82]The enemy within.
[47:53.64]Bruce Banner and the Hulk have barely escaped from a surprise assault on Banner's secret hideout, thanks to a last-second warning from Banner's friend and associate, Dr. Leonard Sampson.
[48:03.78]But Banner's remaining hope for a cure for his affliction, a machine designed to delve into his psyche, while the beast within has been left in ruins as a result...
[48:14.35]Of the attack.
[48:15.61]Good job on the fucking teleprompter, idiot.
[48:18.67]Thanks a lot.
[48:19.89]Fucking dumbass.
[48:22.40]Now Banner has a new adversary.
[48:25.40]A former NSA operative named Emil Blonsky.
[48:30.14]Is it taking a joint?
[48:30.86]Who cares?
[48:31.74]Everyone knows what the fucking Hulk is.
[48:32.94]The Hulk is a radiated guy.
[48:36.27]And there's another guy that wants to be radiated in Strong 2.
[48:38.91]And he's huge.
[48:40.37]And he can fucking punch through walls.
[48:42.11]You don't need to know anything else.
[48:48.85]Like, what else do you need to know about the Hulk?
[48:50.39]You're looking at a 3D model of a handheld neural interface.
[48:53.28]It can perform read or write operations directly into a patient's mind.
[48:57.86]Dude, read or write?
[48:59.20]Without fucking Windows permissions?
[49:01.52]Holy shit, man.
[49:02.66]That was... That was alright.
[49:07.08]I know it won't be pleasant, but it's the only chance we've got.
[49:16.28]Read or write, man.
[49:17.30]I didn't know I was using a CDRW.
[49:20.08]Fuck, man.
[49:21.22]I don't care.
[49:22.12]Hate it.
[49:33.63]See, look.
[49:34.11]That's what I'm saying.
[49:34.71]Just wear fucking stretchy underwear.
[49:39.12]Why rip through a good pair of Jean shorts when you could just wear a bathing suit?
[49:45.12]Just get one like one or two sizes bigger.
[49:47.76]Look, Hulk's waist is not that much bigger than Bruce Banner's.
[49:52.08]What is he, like a... What is Bruce?
[49:54.98]Like a... 38?
[49:57.60]Like 37?
[49:59.15]What is Hulk?
[49:59.73]Like a 60?
[50:02.49]Just get like a 50, or like a 55, and it's gonna be a little loose on Bruce, but that's alright.
[50:07.95]And then when it expands, he just expands into it.
[50:10.01]Spandex.
[50:12.09]What's... I don't... Why wears she like jeans?
[50:20.15]This is fast travel?
[50:26.53]Wait, this is a super fast jump to city.
[50:33.17]What?
[50:34.31]Alright, the Tillboat Grand Hotel.
[50:38.45]You can't do this.
[50:45.74]Is this an open world?
[50:46.74]We've got Batman music.
[50:48.18]That's pretty cool.
[50:49.60]Mission objective.
[50:51.49]Defeat the police resistance.
[50:53.69]What?
[50:54.29]Go!
[51:24.96]Wait, there's just pedestrians walking around right now?
[51:29.17]Why would you walk around right now?
[51:32.22]Come here!
[51:33.06]Hey, you're green?
[51:33.70]Me too!
[51:34.36]We're now best friends!
[51:53.87]Hulk is bouncing off?
[51:57.09]Dude, you gotta watch out.
[51:58.57]Hulk is really popping off right now.
[52:00.77]What was that?
[52:08.43]Sorry.
[52:21.90]I'll never understand this shit, man.
[52:24.45]They always do this in, like, movies and TV shows and... Freeze!
[52:29.71]That's it!
[52:30.21]Hands in the air!
[52:32.41]This is a fucking alien mutant person that can kill you in one punch.
[52:37.28]And no bullets work.
[52:39.56]I don't think they're going to freeze and put their hands up.
[52:43.75]We continue to see this in media.
[52:49.99]The 9mm is not going to work against a guy that can literally pick up a car and throw it into... and explode into another car without any problem.
[52:58.56]Media.
[52:59.14]It's all about the media.
[53:02.72]Like, you don't tell this guy holding the giant fucking ball.
[53:07.82]Put that ball down.
[53:11.39]And then you go like... Like, it's not going to do anything.
[53:14.87]Just watch.
[53:16.95]You should have just not done that.
[53:32.91]Okay, that car.
[53:34.29]Car humping another car.
[53:38.01]Okay, that's just... Get the fuck out of here.
[53:58.61]Yes, yes, it fits in this one too.
[54:01.45]It's in this one too.
[54:02.53]They just drive into stuff.
[54:04.37]I'm so happy Why was this one better than the last one?
[54:11.07]How is this one a better game?
[54:13.81]Holy shit that guy just cuts.
[54:15.73]You think you're getting away?
[54:19.03]This one's just the same game except a little bit better frame rate and not based on Edward Norton
[54:30.66]Break a building.
[54:31.50]Alright, I'm gone.
[54:36.60]This is like Rampage.
[54:38.81]You have to climb up and break and hit every part of it.
[54:43.85]Like, you have to punch here and then here and then here and then here for the building to fall.
[54:49.31]How does this work?
[54:59.49]Rampage is a good game.
[55:00.29]Didn't they remake it too?
[55:01.65]Maybe I should play it.
[55:04.43]Wait, what's this coin?
[55:06.95]That's 2,000 fucking crazy points.
[55:09.41]Alright, this doesn't work.
[55:21.98]Break the targets.
[55:31.46]How are these people faster than me?
[55:38.63]Alright, what's over there?
[55:48.33]This would be fucking horrifying.
[55:50.30]Can you imagine this shit?
[55:54.60]I think you would have thrown up, like, five times by now.
[55:58.00]Your head would be in your stomach.
[55:59.34]Your stomach would be inside of your esophagus.
[56:01.46]It'd be like, bleh, bleh, bleh.
[56:04.58]Hopefully, hopefully.
[56:10.19]Alright, new objective.
[56:24.21]What's this over here?
[56:27.55]What is up here?
[56:29.95]What's with the green with the black in the middle?
[56:31.83]What does that mean?
[56:35.92]Oh, that's a story mission.
[56:39.52]What is this one then?
[56:40.48]Get gorilla.
[56:47.73]Get gorilla.
[56:48.45]What do you mean?
[56:49.37]Get the ape?
[56:50.47]What do you mean?
[56:51.15]Get the ape?
[56:56.43]Use the cheat code.
[56:57.69]Wait.
[56:58.05]Instead of it's... You missed it.
[57:00.59]What do you mean?
[57:01.05]Are you telling me that I get to be a gorilla instead of the Incredible Hulk for the rest of the game?
[57:13.95]No.
[57:15.29]No.
[57:15.49]So grab the gorilla.
[57:17.06]I don't even...
[57:23.66]It's a cheat code.
[57:26.07]Well, let me see.
[57:26.57]Let me do this first.
[57:27.17]Get out of the fucking way.
[57:37.47]Lightning strike.
[57:38.77]We need to take a big risk, Bruce.
[57:40.71]We're going to use the Hulk to help us build the machine through hypnotic implants and auto-suggestion.
[57:45.50]The big blue thing on the gorilla is better than you.
[57:46.94]It's going to take about 5,000 watts to run the equipment.
[57:48.66]And you want me to smash up the main grid?
[57:50.60]Just the relevant parts.
[57:52.40]I've identified three key substations that need to be taken out, but be careful.
[57:57.07]They're surrounded by high-voltage Tesla fields.
[57:59.17]Okay, so destroy substation A, B, and C. Fucking easy enough.
[58:05.91]Sounds easy.
[58:08.34]Destroy the 5G towers.
[58:11.72]Open up the moves list to see what you could do now that you couldn't do in the other game.
[58:16.93]I'll give it a try.
[58:17.47]Let's see.
[58:22.69]Diablo.
[58:24.39]Alright, move gallery.
[58:26.37]Steel fists.
[58:28.01]That's the only one I got.
[58:31.90]Destroy the power substations.
[58:33.36]You got it.
[58:33.82]Let's bust.
[58:42.73]Good.
[58:46.97]Person!
[58:55.48]Alright, we're good.
[58:58.38]Destroy substation A. Can I grab the spotlight?
[59:09.48]It's too bright.
[59:10.06]I don't want it.
[59:17.85]You're a psycho.
[59:20.33]Alright.
[59:25.71]Got it.
[59:33.66]Two more.
[59:37.65]Oh, I'm turning off those lights.
[59:39.93]I get it.
[59:51.84]If you can find all these hints, you will unlock a special prize.
[59:56.58]Huh.
[60:02.53]I like the jump, the jump is a lot of fun.
[60:13.84]Power.
[60:15.42]He's a 12 foot tall manlin.
[60:33.35]Something about that doesn't make any sense.
[60:38.87]Let's put on the steel fist with the AC unit.
[60:42.31]Fuck outta here.
[60:50.18]You die if you go in the water?
[61:07.60]I just flicked her and it killed her.
[61:12.41]But please, put your hands up, Hulk.
[61:15.19]Hands up.
[61:16.29]Freeze.
[61:24.07]I'm getting fable vibes.
[61:27.47]Oh, I would.
[61:28.85]If every five to ten seconds somebody in the town said, Oh, chicken chicer.
[61:34.74]Oh, is that that chicken chicer?
[61:37.88]Oh, chicken chicer.
[61:40.00]And I would say it would make more sense to me.
[61:50.43]Is that that bloody food chicken chicer?
[61:53.89]Never change your name.
[61:54.89]No, why would I?
[61:55.81]It doesn't add anything to the gameplay.
[62:09.99]Use the ape balloons.
[62:11.41]Alright, where are these ape things you guys are talking about?
[62:15.63]I'm at critical mass.
[62:17.37]Hold on, I think I got a critical mass fucking backhand this guy.
[62:27.57]You can play as Ben Stiller.
[62:29.27]Was Ben Stiller in the Hulk movie?
[62:32.29]No he wasn't, was he?
[62:43.59]Ben Stiller was the Hulk.
[62:47.71]Oh, get the hamburger.
[62:48.73]No!
[62:49.15]That would be so funny.
[62:53.32]Actually, a Ben Stiller Hulk would probably be pretty good.
[62:56.06]I don't think it would be bad.
[62:57.20]Do you really think a Ben Stiller Hulk would be a bad Hulk?
[63:12.56]Wait, what do you mean F?
[63:19.00]What do you mean F?
[63:19.44]F?
[63:24.05]Where?
[63:24.49]I don't have any drop frames.
[63:29.27]I have zero drop frames.
[63:31.87]What?
[63:35.87]I think it was your computer.
[63:41.39]I have no drop frames.
[63:46.51]I think it's your computer.
[63:52.84]All of our computers?
[63:53.68]Yeah, all of them.
[63:54.40]It was all of your computers.
[63:56.00]It was everyone's computer at the same time.
[64:05.27]Oh, it breaks?
[64:05.85]That's dumb.
[64:19.88]That was sick.
[64:20.71]Is it Twitch?
[64:22.59]I don't have any drop frames.
[64:25.01]I don't know if it's... It's weird.
[64:27.21]Usually, if there was a problem, it would be a drop frame.
[64:33.53]Oh, I got them all, right?
[64:34.87]Ooh, there's the star.
[64:40.79]There are two types of missions.
[64:41.65]Story missions and challenge missions.
[64:43.90]Story missions are those which progress the story.
[64:49.22]Okay.
[64:51.18]Uh... Build a machine to find a cure for the Gamma mutation.
[64:53.24]Challenge missions are additional objectives and challenges that can be undertaken by the Hulk during the course of play.
[64:58.16]And they're exclamation points.
[65:01.02]What's this?
[65:05.57]Incredible ultimate destruction wiki guide.
[65:07.77]Gorilla balloons everywhere.
[65:09.07]It's king, king.
[65:11.55]I've played for like less than 30 minutes.
[65:14.71]You want me to cheat?
[65:15.41]I'm not cheating.
[65:17.35]I'm not going to cheat right now.
[65:26.94]Let's go to the buy menu.
[65:32.98]Ooh.

[65:35.56]Air recovery.
[65:36.73]Running grab.
[65:37.41]Ground smash.
[65:38.29]Backhand.
[65:39.07]Punt kick.
[65:41.69]This high power kick is useful for distancing troublesome phones.
[65:44.71]X, X, Y. I want this.
[65:50.64]Sonic clap.
[65:52.20]Air stomp.
[65:58.16]Slam down to clear... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[66:03.59]That's perfect.
[66:05.05]Smash Express.
[66:09.65]Run with a two-handed weapon.
[66:11.31]The Smash Express, pick up any two-handed object and deliver the pain.
[66:17.46]X or Y when you run with a two-handed weapon and press X. I'll try it.
[66:25.06]And then Sonic Clap.
[66:28.06]Create a Sonic wave.
[66:29.22]Yep.
[66:29.42]Alright, let's try these.

[66:46.55]No.
[66:47.01]My noise gate is there.
[66:47.93]Alright, let's try this.
[66:55.12]That's going to be so much fun.
[66:55.94]I can't wait to 1, 2, and then punt.
[66:58.60]Punt.
[66:58.82]Okay, this is Sonic Clap.
[67:03.06]Nice.
[67:03.56]Okay.
[67:06.30]What was the other one?
[67:08.26]In the air?
[67:10.32]Yep.
[67:11.48]Oh, I'm going to have so much fun with that one.
[67:13.04]Alright, jump to the city.
[67:22.02]Oh shit, there's a lot of stuff here.

[67:27.82]Yeah, it looks pretty good.
[67:31.61]Next story, Need to Know.
[67:33.73]What are the challenge missions?

[68:18.34]What is this?
[68:25.52]Hulk, ultimate cheating.
[68:29.99]Please cheat.
[68:30.89]No, I'm not cheating.
[68:33.63]Destroy as many spotlights as possible before time runs out.
[68:36.13]Destroy as many... Got it.
[68:48.08]Okay, destroy as many spotlights as possible.
[68:49.99]Excuse me, by the way.
[68:56.99]Don't do this again.
[68:57.74]Oh, by the way, I figured something out recently.
[69:02.56]Everything I've ever recorded on here is saved.
[69:04.62]Alright, spotlights, go.
[69:09.31]Score, one.
[69:14.77]No, that's not a spotlight.
[69:15.55]This is a regular light.
[69:16.57]This is just a light.
[69:17.21]Spotlight.
[69:18.25]Spotlight.

[71:39.42]We're the viewers.
[71:40.36]What was it?
[71:42.02]Nobody has it.
[71:43.90]Come on, give me silver.

[72:19.92]It's worth 6,000 points.
[72:24.24]What do I hear?
[72:24.86]The shark tank sound effect?
[72:31.33]What's the shark tank sound effect?
[72:42.43]He doesn't know.
[72:49.95]No, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[72:51.59]Shark tank?
[72:52.57]Sound effect.
[72:58.73]We'll have to be quick.
[72:59.75]Blonsky knows we're on to him.
[73:01.93]According to an intercepted memo, his backup data is on a computer terminal inside Division HQ.
[73:07.22]We need to rip out the mainframe and bring it back here before Blonsky realizes his mistake.
[73:14.04]The information it contains could be vital to our chances of success.
[73:17.94]Is that the one?
[73:19.82]When does it happen?
[73:21.65]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[73:26.54]It does that when?
[73:28.18]I need to hear it.
[73:33.88]Oh, the one that goes... Sharks have introduced this guy with a new cereal company.
[73:42.11]Whatever.
[73:42.79]Okay, I know what you mean.
[73:44.11]Yeah, I got it.
[73:46.11]Reach the HQ and locate the mainframe computer.
[73:51.90]Oh shit, I said I was going to fix that.
[73:54.34]Shark tank noise.
[74:00.99]Hold on, the greatest shark tank invention.
[74:03.85]I have to hear this.
[74:08.84]Yes, it goes like...
[74:19.36]That's not the sound.
[74:21.04]Where's the actual sound?
[74:27.19]That was so loud.
[74:33.01]That's not- This is Hell's Kitchen.
[74:34.52]Is this it?
[74:47.69]I had it right.
[74:52.32]let's hold on shark tank uh clip shark tank song there it is
[75:22.30]Wait a minute.
[75:27.82]Don't even say this.
[75:29.42]No, it's not.
[75:30.54]It's not.
[76:00.81]I can't even do this shit, man.
[76:15.45]Rita, beware.
[76:16.51]You're in for a scare.
[76:19.21]Goosebumps.
[76:21.16]Well, we figured out something today.
[76:33.62]Can I pee?
[76:34.18]I gotta pee real bad.
[76:35.43]Be right back.
[79:07.26]Shark Tank is a cool show.
[79:08.46]I'll just tell you that.
[79:09.68]I like when they fight over how much equity they're going to get the company.
[79:16.35]But the best part.
[79:32.26]I also love how all the people always start off with the little production they put up.
[79:37.34]They like pitch.
[79:39.70]They do the exact same thing that I taught you guys.
[79:42.32]Look left.
[79:43.14]Look right.
[79:44.68]Look left.
[79:45.74]Look right.
[79:47.00]Look forward.
[79:48.66]Present.
[79:49.48]Look left.
[79:50.48]Look right.
[79:51.56]Look forward.
[79:53.04]Both hands up.
[79:54.52]Presentation.
[79:57.74]It works every time.
[80:01.04]Look left, look right, look straight ahead.
[80:05.02]Just keep doing that.
[80:05.68]You never have to look at anybody.
[80:10.66]Reach the division headquarters.
[80:12.42]Are you presenting crack?
[80:21.74]No, no crack.
[80:23.73]Alright, let's go.
[80:25.99]Play Hulk Ultimate Destruction, Jerma.
[80:27.93]Play Hulk Ultimate Destruction.
[80:36.62]Sure thing man I'll play it right now.
[80:49.51]Wanna play it now?
[80:52.19]Sure, I'll play it right now Did the cop just shoot that car?
[80:58.06]Is that why that happened?
[81:02.88]He hits the telephone pole.
[81:08.48]You guys aren't very good.
[81:11.96]I just fired a rocket directly into one of the thinnest objects on Earth.
[81:26.75]Who is talking to me?
[81:29.48]Retrieve it.
[81:30.68]Retrieve the power.
[81:35.74]Wait.
[81:41.53]That coin.
[81:42.01]Come on, give me the... Give me the coin thing.
[81:47.93]Give me this.
[81:51.68]Put it in the slab.
[81:58.60]Ooh, a 10,000 smash point bonus.
[82:02.55]I'm fucking ecstatic.
[82:06.53]Alright, we're gonna break, break, break, break.
[82:13.40]I got the mainframe computer.
[82:15.84]Alright, throw box at helicopter.
[82:23.97]Whenever a mission objective requires Hulk to protect something, the health of that objective is displayed by the blue health meter.
[82:31.63]Weak objects may not have any additional pips, while strong objects, like buildings, may have several.
[82:37.49]Um, deliver the- Uh, this- is this gonna last?
[82:46.22]Dude, this thing's almost fucking dead!
[82:47.64]It's almost destroyed!
[82:56.47]Where do I have to bring this?
[82:58.35]What did it say?
[83:09.21]Bring it back to... Okay.
[83:15.51]I feel like this is what happens.
[83:17.31]This is like what goes through my mind as to why... When like Warcraft used to fucking lag... Like this is what was happening in my mind.
[83:24.15]Like what's going on with this fucking server?
[83:27.44]This could play out in my head.
[83:30.52]This was the problem.
[83:32.98]Deliver.
[83:41.86]Here you go.
[83:42.32]Here's your computer.
[83:43.86]The key to all our problems is Emil Blonsky.
[83:46.96]We know he was sent by the NSA to monitor Gamma prisoners held inside the vault.
[83:50.65]This is the Shark Tank narrator giving the intro.
[83:52.33]Emil Blonsky is a very dangerous individual.
[83:54.73]His records suggest an emerging persecution complex.
[83:57.83]Perhaps a borderline personality disorder.
[84:00.60]But you better believe, if he's here to supervise Ross, he's trying to find a military application for Gamma transformations.
[84:11.45]There he is.
[84:12.65]Sharks, I'm here today with gamma radiation.
[84:18.10]And they all lean forward.
[84:18.92]Let's see what's up.
[84:25.84]This Hulk progresses through the game.
[84:26.98]He earns smash points.
[84:27.92]Smash points are used to purchase new moves from the buy menu, either in the mission success screen or back at the back door of the church.
[84:33.66]You now have enough smash points to purchase a new move.
[84:36.78]Go into the menu and go find it.
[84:39.90]At the top right corner of your display, the enemy response system.
[84:42.32]The meter is about to turn on.
[84:44.64]Smash stuff and the enemy response system threat level rises.
[84:49.65]Smash lots of stuff and a deadly strike team will be sent to combat Hulk.
[84:54.84]Just like your favorite game, Grand Theft Auto 3. 2...
[84:59.96]four, five, and possibly six.
[85:02.82]Because I don't think this was in... Yes, it was.
[85:04.34]It was in all the Grand Theft Autos.
[85:06.24]Every single one.
[85:06.88]It was an integral part of the whole game since its franchise's inception.
[85:14.77]I don't know why I didn't think stars were in Grand Theft Auto 1.
[85:22.33]That's going to be the big change.
[85:23.43]That's going to be the big gameplay shift in GTA 6.
[85:26.13]No more stars.
[85:27.83]We've decided to get rid of the star system.
[85:31.14]Fuck, what?
[85:32.30]That's insane.
[85:33.24]How are we gonna... How are we gonna be able to do, like, the cops and stuff in, like... There's a new system.
[85:42.65]Alright, backhand for sure.
[85:44.87]XYX.
[85:51.13]Brown smash.
[85:54.90]Running grab.
[85:55.76]Yep.
[85:56.76]That looks pretty good.
[86:00.91]While running, you just hold.
[86:04.23]Would you like to try out the move?
[86:06.81]I can try this out?
[86:07.71]This is a weeb hulk.
[86:16.16]There's no Winx, guys.
[86:18.80]They're gone.
[86:20.04]Can't trick me.
[86:20.84]Can I throw?
[86:21.46]Whiz running throw.
[86:30.15]Why on Earth did I decide to do this to make a loading screen to do something that I know I was just completely capable of Why did I even need to do that Activate the jump marker How big do you think Hulk's shits are
[86:58.08]I have a better question for you.
[87:00.10]This is the questions that people don't ask.
[87:02.56]So if Hulk eats five pizzas, when he turns back into Bruce Banner, do those five pizzas still sit inside of Bruce Banner?
[87:13.63]And does he take the mega shit?
[87:14.93]You know what I'm saying?
[87:25.53]If the Hulk drinks five gallons of liquid because he's the Hulk and he's got to stay hydrated, and then he gets really, really happy.
[87:37.98]What happens to that pee?
[87:40.30]Does it just come out of him like SpongeBob?
[87:42.44]You know, like the SpongeBob SquarePants and like the water comes all out of him and shit.
[87:48.12]Like, is that going to happen?
[87:49.32]Would that happen to you?
[87:50.06]Would it come out of his skin?
[87:56.40]What?
[87:56.88]Why is this such a fucked up thing to ask?
[87:59.66]What, you never thought about this in your whole life?
[88:02.66]If you have a guy that's 12 feet tall and can eat, like, 20 pounds of meat in one sitting, when he turns back into Bruce, that's gotta go somewhere.
[88:11.91]It's gonna come out his eyes.
[88:13.31]Like the Play-Doh toy.
[88:17.09]Like the spaghetti... My Play-Doh spaghetti toy.
[88:20.45]With, like, the...
[88:26.32]Apparently that makes me a fucked up person to bring this up, I guess.
[88:40.51]Protect and serve.
[88:43.42]One, two, three!
[88:50.68]That was awful.
[88:51.80]Hi.
[88:55.34]Guys, there was like a shitty little meme on this channel for like a couple of days about somebody talking about shit.
[89:03.76]And you all thought it was hysterical.
[89:06.24]A specific copy and paste shit thing.
[89:09.34]Everybody thought it was the funniest thing in the world.
[89:10.92]But I talk about Bruce Banner needing to go to the bathroom after eating 12 hamburgers at the Hulk and I'm the psychopath.
[89:18.55]I don't have any... I don't have to move a lot.
[89:29.49]Is this the move zone?
[89:30.95]Let's do a challenge.
[89:34.67]Fast Mover 6.
[89:36.61]Run through the course as fast as possible.
[89:37.85]I'm going to do this.
[89:38.33]This is going to be bad.
[89:39.89]This is going to be real bad.
[89:44.56]We hold you to a higher standard.
[89:48.30]You shouldn't.
[89:49.42]That's your biggest mistake.
[89:56.12]Where is this race?
[90:04.48]Ah.
[90:06.96]What?
[90:08.16]What kind of track was this?
[90:11.38]Okay.
[90:12.46]That didn't follow any logic at all.
[90:14.04]Okay.
[90:31.43]Don't jump.
[90:32.65]Hit it.
[90:34.95]Silver!
[90:38.33]Ah!
[90:39.19]I told you I was gonna fix this and I didn't fix it.
[90:43.75]If Hulk eats a person and then turns back into Bruce Banner, does Banner still have to digest the person Hulk ate?
[90:49.59]Yes!
[90:59.32]Read it.
[90:59.82]I don't want to read it.
[91:00.60]People are eating right now.
[91:03.50]Alright, do I not have another story mission?
[91:07.40]Where is the story mission?
[91:12.64]There ain't no story mission here.
[91:15.05]Oh, there is.
[91:15.53]I need to move.
[91:17.05]Fuck, I need that.
[91:17.89]I need a new move.
[91:19.99]Alright, I need to buy.
[91:20.83]Go back to the church.
[91:21.59]What move do I need?
[91:23.47]Air?
[91:23.65]Air?
[91:35.46]Air recovery, okay.
[91:38.14]Oh, I gotta just go this way.
[91:45.78]Honey over here, get it.
[91:58.17]Why am I illiterate?
[91:59.07]Look at the link.
[91:59.73]I already did.
[92:00.49]Put shit in a VLT sandwich and nobody bats an eye.
[92:06.37]Talk about Bruce Banner's monster shits and everyone loses their minds.
[92:11.35]Yes.
[92:12.51]Exactly.
[92:13.18]You know when people just get you?
[92:18.34]You know when people just get you?
[92:23.00]This is one of those scary ones.
[92:28.00]And by the way, how the fuck are you guys?
[92:31.30]Alright.
[92:36.71]Alright, I gotta buy air recovery.
[92:39.91]This game is fucking awful.
[92:45.65]Kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.
[92:48.29]Kidding, kidding, kidding.
[92:50.44]Air recovery.
[92:51.20]I don't even know how to do it.
[92:55.47]recover instantly from any attack that floats hulk into the air this is important how about dashing straight high speed attack great for clearing just about anything alright we need double fist tossed is a mission thing throw while on the move yup good
[93:22.20]Yeah, I need 25,000 for this.
[93:24.02]Why do I feel like all these moves, I feel like I got them all so early.
[93:28.86]I just bought them all.
[93:29.97]I've done two missions.
[93:38.17]There are more.
[93:38.95]Sick.
[93:43.78]There's a fuckload more.
[93:45.76]You don't have to say the F word.
[93:46.86]Why would you say the F word?
[93:49.82]It's like kind of rude and shit.
[93:53.78]It's the part where I say, dude watch the F word, no swearing here.
[93:57.20]Fucking idiot.
[93:57.96]Like I say fuck.
[93:59.80]You know what I mean?
[94:00.30]Like I say don't say that and then I say it.
[94:02.87]And then everybody laughs.
[94:09.89]This streamer is kind of toxic.
[94:13.83]And then that's when I go, I'm not toxic.
[94:15.19]What are you talking about?
[94:17.13]We just have fun here.
[94:19.74]Just chill, we're having a good time, and then I say, you fucking idiot.
[94:23.93]Why didn't I grab?
[94:41.00]Grab it!
[94:53.36]Eat the giant hamburger.
[94:54.44]You can't.
[94:55.02]I already tried.
[95:00.39]Wait.
[95:00.65]I want to try the new move.
[95:05.89]Holy shit.
[95:06.41]My whole body is shaking right now.
[95:08.52]How cool that was.
[95:09.16]Alright.
[95:11.18]Here we go.
[95:15.61]We have a target of opportunity.
[95:17.31]I've hacked a lab computer at a division research facility.
[95:20.45]Which is illegal.
[95:21.25]Very.
[95:22.05]I just tripped a failsafe so Blonsky knows I'm inside.
[95:25.75]He'll destroy the entire place before he allows the download to complete.
[95:29.31]You're asking me to run protection while you loot the network.
[95:32.13]Six or seven minutes.
[95:33.28]That's all I need.
[95:34.28]Seven, seven minutes.
[95:36.56]Seven minutes is all I need to destroy a bio research center.
[95:40.28]Defend the bio research center until the data downloads.
[95:42.82]What kind of connection do you have?
[95:46.18]So, oh, I need data.
[95:47.62]So, you're downloading, it's probably text.
[95:50.78]Right?
[95:51.08]How much data is on there?
[95:52.74]If you need to wait 10 minutes to download, like, 3,000 to 4,000K of stuff, get another fucking service provider.
[96:00.32]Get another computer.
[96:03.54]Could I recommend Fiber Internet to you?
[96:05.04]I'm on it.
[96:08.30]This was 2004.
[96:09.65]Oh, shit!
[96:10.59]It was.
[96:11.55]Wait.
[96:12.39]Average...
[96:14.48]Broadband existed in 2000.
[96:16.64]Average internet speeds in 2004.
[96:21.34]Oh.
[96:21.62]Uh.
[96:28.85]2000k is what the average was.
[96:34.87]Fuck.
[96:35.63]How is that so spot on?
[96:38.29]The average cable is 2178 kbps.
[96:43.64]Okay, well, it's accurate then.
[96:47.59]It's accurate.
[96:48.91]Fine.
[96:53.01]Still on Wi-Fi.
[96:54.05]Am I on that or am I on Almonder?
[96:56.13]Which one?
[96:56.59]I'm not sure.
[97:04.70]Uh-huh.
[97:07.20]Three and a half.
[97:07.70]I thought, what if I have seven minutes?
[97:09.04]That was an incredibly wrong estimate.
[97:13.08]Hulk, this is going to take you 7 minutes to do.
[97:14.96]Just kidding.
[97:15.66]3 minutes and 30 seconds.
[97:17.42]Get out of here.
[97:19.40]Oh, yes!
[97:19.66]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[97:22.56]Running, running grass.
[97:43.85]I love the wind-up.
[97:46.94]Backhand, this backhand.
[97:49.26]One, two, three.
[97:50.02]Wait.
[97:52.92]Is it destroyed?
[97:57.22]Where is this tank?
[98:03.87]Critical mass achieved, good.
[98:11.69]Destroy this shit!
[98:12.49]Get rid of this tank!
[98:13.27]Come on!
[98:13.77]Kick it!
[98:16.97]How many tanks are here?
[98:20.31]Dude, how many stars do I have?
[98:23.31]This shit didn't even happen in GTA.
[98:24.91]Or maybe one would come down the road.
[98:26.55]There's too many tanks!
[98:38.51]Get out of here!
[98:40.76]Oh!
[98:42.42]Two more minutes.
[98:50.24]He's dead.
[98:51.88]When Hulk's power gets low, he experiences an adrenaline surge.
[98:55.22]This increases his attack damage.
[98:56.78]Gives him access to special moves.
[99:01.49]Okay.
[99:01.81]I'm going to adrenaline surge.
[99:08.71]I have the Hulk mod unlocked for command and conquer.
[99:15.32]There's too many.
[99:17.20]What the fuck?
[99:22.08]Kick him!
[99:25.29]There we go.
[99:26.09]Alright, hunt.
[99:27.19]One, two, hunt.
[99:35.47]That's so good.
[99:42.62]Is that blood?
[99:43.56]Yup.
[99:44.26]It's blood in this fucking game.
[99:45.36]What do you think about it now?
[99:51.74]Just throw trees.
[99:55.16]Get this fucking man in Karka tanks!
[100:01.07]Get the fuck outta here!
[100:15.72]Die!
[100:17.04]No!
[100:17.64]Please!
[100:25.75]Kick it!
[100:26.33]Kick it!
[100:27.27]Kick it!
[100:27.85]Kick it!
[100:28.27]Smash it!
[100:28.93]Do anything!
[100:41.52]Why won't you die?
[100:43.12]I don't know.
[100:44.38]Do a falcon kick.
[100:45.20]I've got armadillo right now.
[100:48.00]Got it.
[101:03.61]Mission complete.
[101:08.97]Do some jump cancels?
[101:10.05]Wait, now I have to destroy the building?
[101:20.82]Hold on.
[101:28.06]What the hell do you mean, need to know, Basis?
[101:31.64]Calm down, General.
[101:33.46]You're going to have an aneurysm.
[101:35.61]You've commandeered the Intervault and established a level 15 clearance.
[101:39.03]Only the president's senior cabinet members have that access.
[101:42.52]Surely you of all people don't need a lesson in protocol, General.
[101:46.32]That's what it looks like it's made out of fondant.
[101:49.79]Shouldn't you be more concerned with keeping the Hulk in check?
[101:53.13]You're not as clever as you think you are, Blonsky.
[101:56.03]Who's behind me?
[101:57.41]Who's behind me?
[101:57.97]Oh, no.
[101:58.53]I thought he was going to turn around and be surprised by the person behind him.
[102:03.75]Nope.
[102:03.87]What?
[102:04.11]Oh, my God.
[102:04.73]It's the Green Goblin?
[102:07.09]No!
[102:21.79]You can kill them all.
[102:24.87]That's a Green Goblin scenario?
[102:25.97]When you look in the mirror, when you have Hulk powers, the Green Goblin talks to you?
[102:32.30]Samson!
[102:33.32]Okay.
[103:01.45]That was his D&D character.
[103:02.83]Maybe I should go to the buy menu.
[103:07.83]You guys understand.
[103:10.09]I was around.
[103:10.93]I know here come like the boomer emotes and the old person emotes.
[103:15.16]But I remember being on 28.8k.
[103:17.36]That was back when if somebody picked up the telephone, your whole computer crashed.
[103:26.98]Can you imagine being in the living room on a 28.8k connection?
[103:32.94]in some random chat room somewhere, and somebody in the upstairs bedroom picked up the telephone, your computer crashed.
[103:46.47]I remember it would be like, if something really important was happening, it would be like, for instance, if my father was on the computer, and he's like, he would always just scream up to everybody, whoever was upstairs or wherever, he'd be like, alright, I got an important thing going on here, nobody pick up a phone!
[104:03.17]And it was like, oh shit, okay, we can't do anything.
[104:07.03]We cannot communicate with anybody.
[104:09.37]Ever.
[104:09.83]For the next, like, probably two, three, four hours.
[104:12.61]But you would forget, and you would pick up a phone, and it would do that, and you'd freak out and hang it up immediately and hope to God that it wasn't going to fuck up the connection and fuck up the computer.
[104:26.88]And all of a sudden you would hear, it would be like this.
[104:29.60]It would be like,
[104:31.65]Oh, yeah, I gotta call, uh, I gotta call Mike, yeah, I gotta talk to Mike.
[104:35.83]Oh, let me pick up the phone and... Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[104:44.08]What happened?
[104:45.64]Fuck!
[104:46.14]Like, goddammit, it went... Shit.
[104:49.12]Somebody pick up the phone?
[104:50.93]No, no, I, no, I, I may have... It's like, gah!
[104:55.47]That was life.
[105:06.49]Tell us more stories, Grandpa.
[105:08.15]I'm going to save up for Critical Atomic Slam.
[105:13.62]Slonsky files on Samson.
[105:17.36]Whatever.
[105:18.48]Do I have my own file?
[105:21.35]I don't care.
[105:22.99]That's the lore.
[105:25.85]Somebody else will read it.
[105:26.53]Take a screenshot.
[105:27.73]You can read it later.
[105:32.59]You know that when me and Burger Boy used to sit in Burger Boy's room and play video games all day?
[105:37.73]That's from me and Burger Boy.
[105:40.31]Anytime there was something to read, it was like, oh, somebody else will read this, and we just skipped it.
[105:48.56]For everything.
[105:49.18]It didn't matter what it was.
[105:50.10]If there was a note on a table that was more than four or five paragraphs long, it was instantly skipped.
[106:00.15]If it was not integral to the video game.
[106:03.29]It was never read.
[106:05.95]Is that why you can't read?
[106:13.00]How did I read your comment then?
[106:19.17]Maybe if you thought about shit before writing it.
[106:29.38]Put text to speech on.
[106:30.50]I told you that I was never going to do that.
[106:32.84]Oh, gorilla!
[106:45.27]Pick up gorilla.
[106:46.03]Alright, I've got gorilla.
[106:47.91]Finally.
[106:48.31]This is like annoyingly in the way.
[107:01.87]Fire sale.
[107:02.39]We have to start putting the machine together.
[107:04.87]I'm stuck without a hydraulic lift to move the heavier parts.
[107:08.45]I need a generator for power conversion and a CAT scan apparatus to get an accurate topographic image of your brain.
[107:14.78]I deliver this shit.
[107:15.74]Okay.
[107:27.04]You gotta go on a Home Depot run.
[107:32.75]Oh, no, I lost the gorilla.
[107:33.83]Get the steel fists.
[107:38.40]This is going to be annoying.
[107:41.50]I don't want to do this shit.
[107:45.68]This sucks.
[107:47.74]I don't want to do this.
[107:49.04]This is pissing me off.
[107:53.17]This is pissing me off.
[107:54.77]How come there's no Ninja Turtles?
[107:58.87]Oh.
[108:01.56]Do you know what Ninja Turtle game would come out every year?
[108:03.56]From like 1989 to like 1999 or like 2005 or something.
[108:08.08]Where's the Ninja Turtles games?
[108:10.63]Where the fuck are they?
[108:13.63]Ninja Turtles games come out every single year.
[108:15.25]Wait, where is that?
[108:25.55]Oh, it's across the whole city.
[108:34.36]I'm not 50, shut up grandpa, neither am I. I am closer to 50 than I am to 80 now, aren't I?
[108:46.20]Alright, let's go, take this building.
[108:59.35]Nice!
[109:00.63]I can destroy buildings now, do I need bulk hands?
[109:05.81]Is this shit loud?
[109:06.53]Because it's not too loud for me.
[109:10.21]Deliver the- Oh my god.
[109:13.04]You're standing on top of it.
[109:17.46]Alright, let's go.
[109:20.56]What is this thing?
[109:21.22]It's like a Sonic the Hedgehog spring.
[109:23.82]This thing's almost dead.
[109:34.53]The Nintendo Labo piece.
[109:48.42]Yeah, this is a Nintendo Labo.
[109:51.79]Completed construction after using it one time.
[109:58.97]It's all bent and torn up and shit.
[110:04.11]Gorilla!
[110:08.29]Wait.
[110:09.15]There's a, uh... There's an Almonder in here.
[110:18.04]Can I get this?
[110:20.68]There we go.
[110:29.90]Alright.
[110:31.16]Jump to the church.
[110:35.94]This is Prototype, but the Hulk.
[110:40.01]Yeah, I couldn't play Prototype.
[110:41.77]So, this works for me.
[110:48.23]It's the same devs as Prototype.
[110:50.05]Is it really?
[110:53.09]That's kind of a PogChamp moment, don't you think?
[110:57.07]He's using emotes now and he thinks it sounds normal.
[111:00.11]Does not sound fucking natural at all.
[111:03.35]Holy shit.
[111:04.31]Go back to 56k, stupid.
[111:14.02]The Hulk has done billions of dollars in damage.
[111:21.04]Yeah.
[111:22.84]That's a lot of damage.
[111:23.76]Even just walking.
[111:26.50]Just look at this.
[111:26.92]I know a lot of people say, like, oh, yeah, what about the superheroes when they destroy stuff?
[111:31.31]We're just talking about, like, walking through the town.
[111:35.95]Like, right there, this is like a $4,000 to $5,000 repair.
[111:40.41]Just from me walking on him.
[111:41.99]Just walking here.
[111:45.31]This is like a $30,000 repair job now.
[111:56.87]Alright, gotta get in there.
[111:59.35]Do I go in the beam?
[112:01.91]Ow.
[112:03.19]Oh, they have shields.
[112:05.35]Don't worry, I'll take care of this.
[112:09.15]What's up, dude?
[112:11.43]Oh, is that... Who's that?
[112:13.07]Is that somebody you know?
[112:14.46]Go say hi.
[112:16.44]I need to get rid of the shield.
[112:27.86]Can I go in this?
[112:31.78]Wait.
[112:32.74]Did I get him?
[112:37.54]They're just all over the... Where are these shields?
[112:43.28]I fell off.
[112:45.52]Sorry, man.
[112:52.57]Charge.
[112:53.05]What do you mean charge?
[112:57.13]Charge?
[113:00.13]Keep throwing shit?
[113:07.21]Charge your phone.
[113:18.68]Alright, that's how you do it.
[113:34.76]Go!
[113:36.10]Was Ivan Ooze the Power Rangers or was that the Ninja Turtle?
[113:46.61]Oh my god, they're firing.
[113:52.04]What the fuck?
[113:52.78]Get out of here, man.
[113:54.08]Leave me alone.
[113:56.80]The secret of the Ooze was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[114:04.38]But Ivan Ooze was powering.
[114:18.63]Ivan Oo.
[114:21.81]I feel like if I watched that movie again, I would probably really... I probably like that movie more now than when I was 14.
[114:29.25]I gotta watch that.
[114:39.88]I gotta watch Power Rangers and the Pursuit of Ivan Oo, whatever it's called.
[114:45.22]And the...
[114:47.24]What's the name of that movie?
[114:48.49]What's the name of the Power Rangers movie?
[114:50.19]Well, if that's Power Rangers, the movie too, right?
[115:04.91]Name Ivan Ooze sounds like a Jerma character.
[115:08.59]Ivan Ooze.
[115:15.25]What was the first Power Rangers movie about?
[115:20.22]And, wait, wasn't there a thing with, like, Zordon?
[115:23.06]Like, Zordon was, like, a guy, like, lying down in a coffin or something?
[115:27.84]Like, Zordon... Doesn't, like, Zordon... Wait, what happens to Zordon?
[115:33.56]Zordon was the weirdest character.
[115:35.98]He was just the wizard from The Wizard of Oz.
[115:39.55]And then why did they listen to Zordon?
[115:41.41]Who was Zordon?
[115:42.99]Why would they listen to Zordon?
[115:50.67]The Power Rangers took all their orders from a guy that was like a floating hallucination in a tube, right?
[115:57.50]Who was he?
[115:58.12]Did they ever go over to the lore?
[116:06.10]They did?
[116:11.06]He was an alien.
[116:12.66]Well, yeah, but... Was this a toilet or a fridge?
[116:16.90]What is this?
[116:18.54]I got the toilet.
[116:24.45]No, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, you brought back a fucking toilet.
[116:27.03]That's not what we wanted.
[116:29.89]We were looking for the cat scan machine.
[116:33.05]Oh, sorry.
[116:34.09]Yeah, me dumb, right?
[116:40.25]And then it goes to the next part of Robot Chicken.
[116:45.31]+2, I guess.
[117:00.74]Yeah, thanks.
[117:02.64]Okay, I got 25k.
[117:03.38]What are we going to spend our 25,000 points on?
[117:18.78]That was pretty sick.
[117:20.04]Like, you won in Smash Brothers.
[117:22.35]End of the... Completed, right?
[117:26.23]Or something?
[117:28.79]No, put the phone down.
[117:29.95]Put the phone down.
[117:31.11]You fucking asshole.
[117:33.07]Trying to save that.
[117:36.00]Don't try to cut me off.
[117:41.18]I'm streaming right now.
[117:43.10]Don't open that phone.
[117:43.96]Don't pick it up.
[117:47.57]Critical atomic slam.
[117:50.59]Extra range, extra power, no calories.
[117:52.63]So that's good.
[117:54.19]So in critical mass, are we going to get another one?
[117:59.83]Oh, I need ground smash first.
[118:01.57]I can get them both, can't I?
[118:07.88]Ground smash and then super critical smash.
[118:12.80]Alright, I can remember to do this.
[118:15.10]I bought them all, didn't I?
[118:18.93]I think Jerma plans the jokes pre-stream.
[118:22.92]You severely overestimate my preparedness for each stream.
[118:29.52]Usually it goes something like this.
[118:32.30]I'm hungry.
[118:33.12]Fuck, I need to eat something before I sit down.
[118:34.73]Okay, let me eat.
[118:37.97]Alright, what am I playing today?
[118:38.91]I have no idea.
[118:40.13]Oh, wait.
[118:41.45]The Incredible Hulk was delivered today.
[118:45.99]That's, uh, sure, let's do that.
[118:47.99]Does it work?
[118:48.65]I don't know.
[118:49.95]When does the stream start?
[118:51.39]Um, in like 40 minutes.
[118:53.51]Let's see if this stream can even happen.
[118:56.38]Okay, put it in.
[118:57.50]Yeah, no, it works.
[118:59.10]Okay, 20 minutes until the stream starts.
[119:01.58]I forgot to eat.
[119:02.84]Right, I did this first.
[119:04.48]I gotta eat something.
[119:05.34]Oh, I've had to take a shit for the last hour.
[119:07.18]Okay, let me do that too.
[119:08.81]End up eating while I'm taking a shit.
[119:11.13]Which is, I'm just trying to get double time there to make it so I can get on here on time.
[119:20.23]And then I turn the button on.
[119:27.55]He's 10 steps ahead.
[119:30.38]At the end of a chapter, a star marker will appear at the church.
[119:33.36]This marker will take the Hulk to a new challenge.
[119:35.80]These guys are tough.
[119:37.08]So spend your smash points on new moves.
[119:44.36]Nemesis.
[119:44.86]Oh, here we go.
[119:45.26]Let's do it.
[119:49.33]We're going to get our first boss fight?
[119:50.95]There's something happening at the military base.
[119:53.07]Listen to this transmission.
[119:54.29]We're under attack.
[119:56.57]Some kind of creature came out of nowhere.
[119:58.83]Did he say some kind of creature?
[120:00.53]I'm pretty sure that's not you, Bruce.
[120:03.00]Better go check it out before someone decides this is your fault.
[120:10.99]That was the equivalent of when you're writing on a piece of paper and you you wrote way too big the first two or three words and then when you get you're at the edge of the paper and you just got a fucking I just fill it as many letters as I can and then all the way to the edge of the paper.
[120:32.75]We're under attack.
[120:34.51]I'm kind of- AHH!
[120:38.19]Like, you didn't utilize your four seconds of recording that you were allowed.
[120:42.09]Well.
[120:43.17]We're under attack!
[120:46.19]It's some kind of creature!
[120:49.46]You only got five seconds, man.
[120:50.72]You gotta make it count.
[120:52.02]Give me info that I need.
[120:53.08]Not enough space on the disk.
[120:58.90]Why does the monster always attack mid-message, too?
[121:01.75]Yeah, why does that happen?
[121:03.61]Why can't somebody, like, call or leave a message?
[121:07.72]It's like the monster is fucking sprinting at them while they're talking on the phone.
[121:14.50]Yes, leave your distress call.
[121:17.03]Uh, yeah, there's, um... I'm looking at him right now.
[121:19.51]He's about 200, 300 feet away.
[121:22.61]We have a problem.
[121:23.67]It looks like there's some kind of monster.
[121:25.61]He's getting close.
[121:26.41]He's coming out!
[121:27.99]Like, don't you see him?
[121:28.68]Why don't you just, like, fucking hide behind a dumpster or something for a minute?
[121:34.12]Call when you see him for the first time, not when he's running at you like a train.
[121:42.04]Uh-oh.
[121:46.71]It's Hulk.
[121:47.13]This is when the Hulk goes, see how powerful you are?
[122:02.18]Join me.
[122:02.92]Oh, that's you.
[122:04.40]Die.
[122:04.76]Okay.
[122:06.92]Here we go.
[122:39.14]Yes, it will.
[122:41.13]It will work.
[122:41.93]Get out of here.
[122:48.59]Alright, I got it.
[122:49.11]Here we go.
[122:49.59]One, two, three, eat shit.
[122:51.37]Did I just cave him in?
[122:55.46]I think I did.
[122:56.88]Yeah, I did.
[122:57.54]I didn't even mean to do that.
[123:00.44]Ow.
[123:00.62]Just some more.
[123:03.59]What?
[123:08.95]Oh, no.
[123:09.65]He's got a warhead.
[123:12.73]Wait, I can't pick it up?
[123:13.53]We can't play catch?
[123:14.49]It'll soon be over.
[123:21.45]Oh, my stuff.
[123:22.97]I'm right here.
[123:24.11]Wait.
[123:25.37]Don't lie.
[123:25.97]Hold on.
[123:26.99]Wait.
[123:27.35]Don't touch the scale.
[123:28.29]You just told me.
[123:35.10]See, you get angry.
[123:36.40]If you try that, I'll kill you.
[123:40.39]Why don't you shut the fuck up, man?
[123:45.31]I got this.
[123:47.80]Eat this.
[123:51.22]Take this, idiot.
[123:54.40]By the way, why are we fighting?
[123:57.00]We shouldn't be fighting.
[123:57.90]Son of a bitch.
[123:58.56]Hey.
[124:07.99]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[124:09.91]Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out.
[124:12.23]Time out.
[124:14.63]Just possibly let me time out.
[124:18.93]Now I got adrenaline, now you're dead.
[124:21.29]Here, I'll sack for you.
[124:23.06]Hey, I gotta tell you, be careful.
[124:28.46]Once we're done with this, when you go to the bathroom, when you change back, you're gonna be shitting all the air because you ain't up there and I couldn't even get the joke out.
[124:36.88]I feel no pity.
[124:54.17]I was trying to say, if I didn't die, I would have got it out.
[124:57.38]Just trying to say that, like, hey, this is the first time you've changed over.
[125:00.60]Listen to me.
[125:01.22]Like, you think you can eat everything you want, but when you change back, you're going to be shitting bricks, is what I was going to say.
[125:06.26]But I died, and it would have been funny.
[125:08.21]Try it again.
[125:13.93]What?
[125:26.82]wasn't funny I thought it was funny do you have the guts let's find out and I thought it was funny therefore I would say it you sure why are you letting me do this
[125:57.60]Oh no, here it comes!
[126:07.99]Aww.
[126:11.69]Don't let him get near me.
[126:15.49]Nice throw, Smorg.
[126:20.50]Oh, I know what this is.
[126:22.62]Oh, this must be liquid nitrogen.
[126:28.34]Can I grab him?
[126:36.52]Can't grab him.
[126:41.22]I'm gonna die again.
[126:52.03]Wait, I can run and throw.
[126:57.45]Why did I just turn around?
[127:04.65]This is so stupid looking.
[127:08.70]Get out of here.
[127:13.74]Nice elbow lap.
[127:29.12]That was a real laugh.
[127:30.08]Yeah, I went... Ooh, he didn't get to throw this.
[127:38.99]I can throw it at him now.
[127:42.05]What is going on?
[127:45.97]Did he actually just grab me?
[127:50.09]No, fuck.
[127:51.05]He's gonna belly-to-belly suplex me again.
[128:00.36]I'm gonna lose kick him kick him kick him kick him
[128:30.88]I was just pretending to be dead.
[128:40.15]You fool!
[128:58.64]Imagine if we just showed his head get just crushed by a cinder block and just blood and guts and brains.
[129:09.55]What?
[129:32.41]What?
[129:46.52]Is he like ratting out his other personality?
[129:49.32]No, you say like, I don't know, it was an earthquake or something.
[129:55.48]I don't know.
[130:09.20]Oh, that was the other guy.
[130:10.35]Okay, well, hold on.
[130:12.49]Shield.
[130:14.97]Weaponization.
[130:15.59]Create a shield from large vehicles.
[130:18.65]Cool.
[130:20.41]Shockwave smash.
[130:23.10]Slam kick.
[130:25.22]Slam a two-handed weapon into an enemy and then execute a punishing follow-up.

[130:55.43]F?
[131:01.07]I still have no drop frames.
[131:02.65]What's going on?
[131:08.42]Why would you guys do this to me?
[131:11.80]It's fine, not F. What?
[131:15.80]He fell for it again.
[131:16.98]Wait, are you guys fucking with me because I've got a fiber optic internet now and you guys are scaring me?
[131:24.84]I have zero drop frames the whole stream.
[131:30.20]Why would you do this to me?
[131:33.96]First time it was real.
[131:34.84]I think the first time was Twitch.
[131:38.13]I have zero drop frames.
[131:41.68]There's no other internet that's better than, like, Fiverr.
[131:44.66]I'm going to have to, like... When do you get better internet?
[131:53.52]There is no better internet.
[131:56.25]No, it's good.
[131:57.01]It's fine.
[131:57.61]It's been rock solid the whole time.
[132:00.77]Maybe if he keeps saying that, he can sleep at night.
[132:14.45]You have an internet curse?
[132:15.83]Well, no.
[132:16.35]I think the curse is broken.
[132:17.69]I've got zero draw frames.
[132:19.17]I've got... It's been rock solid for the whole stream.
[132:21.43]Alright.
[132:35.52]Rock solid.
[132:38.86]You finished a chapter of the game.
[132:40.32]Hooray.

[132:51.37]Demented streamer talks to empty chat.

[133:55.73]Ever, under any circumstance.
[133:59.57]Do you understand it's impossible to control the car?
[134:03.05]Once you go that fast.
[134:07.34]I'm not even doing anything.
[134:08.62]I mean, this is odd.
[134:09.70]This is a little odd.
[134:14.06]It's, I wouldn't say this is dangerous.
[134:26.17]It's not even dangerous.
[134:27.29]It's odd.
[134:32.38]See?
[134:42.31]You're lucky you're not targetable.
[134:45.97]If you were targetable, you'd be in big trouble.

[135:28.89]The cop was a cow.
[135:31.93]He just got out of the car.
[135:36.14]Satan.
[135:37.42]It must be Satan.
[135:59.53]Was that a tank?

[144:04.08]People have tried to explain it to me.
[144:05.16]I still don't get it.
[144:05.70]I don't know what it is.
[144:07.20]We need boots on the ground!

[146:04.89]I'm going to say it again.
[146:16.36]Here comes another joke that you've heard before.
[146:18.58]That was just like playing Smash Brothers online.
[146:34.74]Did I just say I'm gonna puke?
[146:36.54]I'm gonna puke!
[146:52.08]This one's very heavily guarded.

[147:56.80]I'm gonna- I'm gonna just slow it down a little because I need to kill those... ...helicopters.
[148:07.16]Why are you blaming Hulk when you control him?
[148:10.68]Yeah, that's a myth.
[148:11.80]That's just a myth.
[148:14.60]There could be tons of different reasons why you would fuck up something.
[148:18.58]It's a myth.
[148:20.89]Alright, swing.
[148:51.29]Okay, there gets to be a point where these things are uncontrollable just throw a spear at it
[149:18.73]What?
[149:18.97]What do I?
[149:20.69]How do I grab something?
[149:32.46]Oh, I just decided to... Can I pick up?
[149:47.74]Oh!

[152:40.37]This way.
[152:40.85]Only one more.
[152:47.97]I need to go back to Beautiful Joe.
[152:52.26]I'm not sure that's going to happen.
[152:53.74]In fact, I'm certain it's not going to happen.
[152:56.18]I can tell you it's not going to happen.
[152:59.94]I was attacked.
[153:01.38]I was verbally attacked.
[153:04.34]Oh, comic book.
[153:09.58]And 2,000 gamer points.
[153:11.34]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[153:22.69]2,000 more points.
[153:23.17]Oh, and unlockable.
[153:27.37]Chat always does this.
[153:29.63]It's almost like the most predictable group of people ever.
[153:34.95]Don't you dare play this anymore.
[153:36.31]Get out of here.
[153:36.95]Don't play Beautiful Joe.
[153:38.21]This game's dumb.
[153:39.15]I don't like Beautiful Joe.
[153:40.23]Beautiful Joe's stupid.
[153:41.09]I don't like it.
[153:41.67]This game's boring.
[153:42.37]This game's stupid.
[153:44.01]I haven't played Beautiful Joe in six days.
[153:45.99]Where's Beautiful Joe?
[153:46.91]I think Beautiful Joe's not back.
[153:48.09]I mean, it's Beautiful Joe.
[153:48.99]I like Beautiful Joe.
[153:49.75]It's a good game.
[153:50.25]You should play that.
[153:50.73]Play it right now.
[153:51.53]Play Beautiful Joe right now.
[153:52.73]I like the shark.
[153:53.39]Shark was the best boss in the game.
[153:54.53]Why did you stop playing?
[153:55.37]What's wrong with you?
[153:58.79]Then I play it again.
[154:02.69]This is a meltdown.
[154:04.27]No, it's not.
[154:04.99]This is just truth.
[154:06.99]You're hearing the truth.
[154:12.65]He hates us.
[154:15.69]Chad is not one person.
[154:16.96]Yes, you are.
[154:18.58]You're one person with like 5,000 mouths.
[154:36.08]Oh, back up, back, fine, back up, I... Okay, seriously, just... Just die, oh, please.
[155:03.99]We're all one guy.
[155:04.93]I'm just kidding, guys.
[155:06.05]I know.
[155:07.09]I think I really believe that.
[155:08.87]I think I really believe that.
[155:15.82]Yep.
[155:16.42]Yep.
[155:20.26]Yep.
[155:22.28]New Blonsky detected.
[155:24.91]Blonsky files are Emily Blonsky's personal data files decrypted from a stolen mainframe.
[155:31.03]After certain story mode mission completions, you will be rewarded with more Blonsky files.
[155:42.38]No, I don't.
[155:43.22]I'm just fucking around.
[155:46.82]How long have you guys been on this channel for?
[155:48.16]Like six months to a year, some of you.
[155:50.60]Some of you have been here for like 13, 14, 15 months.
[155:53.38]Some of you have been here for 10 years.
[155:56.55]That's way too many.
[155:58.77]Get a copy of yourself.
[155:59.95]What?
[156:01.19]Bought yourself a convoy.
[156:02.45]What's going on?
[156:19.14]Alright, I don't... Let's just go.
[156:20.08]I don't wanna... I'm gonna get killed here.
[156:27.00]Alright, just leave.
[156:29.40]Leave.
[156:29.64]Ah, that was cool.
[156:30.48]Hold on.
[156:34.50]Stop interrupting me.
[156:36.31]No, fuck!
[156:38.09]Whatever, leave.
[156:39.53]Leave!
[156:46.55]Oh my god!
[156:52.95]Leave!
[156:53.89]Leave me alone!
[156:55.19]Oh, I'm dead!
[157:01.44]I just, like, flanked.
[157:03.22]What?!
[157:06.72]Did I just really Mortal Kombat die?
[157:09.70]Did you get me in, like, a 30-hit combo and I stood up and fell down?
[157:13.16]Please!
[157:14.14]Just go back to the church.
[157:32.59]Wait, 35,000 points.
[157:35.39]That seems kind of pog.
[157:41.90]Got an 8.9 out of 10 from Official Xbox Magazine.
[157:46.66]Here's what I don't understand.
[157:48.02]Here's the conspiracy theory.
[157:51.46]Weird.
[157:53.20]So, this has an 8.
[157:54.36]It's on the box.
[157:57.21]It says, as you see.
[157:58.45]It says...
[158:02.38]Take a look.
[158:07.80]8.
[158:08.09]9 out of 10.
[158:09.55]On the box.
[158:11.07]How did they know it was an 8.
[158:12.13]9 out of 10 before the game was released?
[158:15.23]That's kind of a fucking conspiracy theory, I think.
[158:20.47]What's going on there?
[158:26.74]You like my Qbert?
[158:27.68]I know the camera's in a fucking weird place.
[158:32.59]The Reddit room.
[158:33.85]Don't, I do, do not make that be what you call this room.
[158:38.83]If, if you call this the Reddit room, I'm going to move to a new room.
[158:53.08]Not a fucking Reddit room.
[158:55.08]Did you see it?
[158:55.84]Not even so.
[158:57.60]I just, I got on the shelf there.
[158:58.92]I got the thing, the movies, black and white is up there.
[159:04.07]Why is there a stepladder?

[219:18.92]Okay.
[219:21.68]Okay.
[219:22.34]Okay.
[219:25.78]I'll play it tomorrow.
[219:30.05]I'm not done streaming.
[219:38.47]This game's actually pretty fun.
[219:40.43]It was visiting Reddit.
[219:46.57]What about the movie?
[219:47.17]Alright, so we'll talk about it again because a lot of people weren't here in the beginning of the stream, so we'll go over it again.
[219:52.59]Half of you probably weren't even here.
[219:55.73]Because of this last week getting sort of deleted.
[219:58.63]Because of all the stuff with auto.
[220:02.85]I've decided that we're just going to play games.
[220:05.05]We're going to stream for these three days in a row here.
[220:07.41]And then we're going to do it this coming next week.
[220:10.23]The same streams that you were waiting for this past week.
[220:15.27]They've been deleted and they've been replaced on next week.
[220:19.89]So we're going to go Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[220:25.16]Just essentially moved it.
[220:26.16]Is it recorded?
[220:32.51]Do I not have any more missions?
[220:35.65]Transit.
[220:49.92]Do I need to unlock a move or something?
[220:59.89]There's no missions on the... Fire a mission.
[221:05.31]I guess I could do one of the challenge ones.
[221:09.73]I was so uncalled for.
[221:13.60]I feel bad.
[221:14.96]Okay, run to the course.
[221:25.10]Let chat redecorate.
[221:26.51]What?
[221:27.15]No.
[221:30.61]To say Bazinga?
[221:31.79]To... Um... Big Bang Theory?
[221:35.70]What are you talking about?
[222:00.40]Quite the race.
[222:17.54]It's hard to control this shit.
[222:21.98]Did I even get it?
[222:49.39]Last one is up.
[222:57.07]It's the Sheldon Funko Pop.
[222:58.43]Boy, this is pre-recorded.
[222:59.51]How much is the Sheldon Funko Pop?
[223:09.71]Sheldon Funko Pop.
[223:16.22]It's like $40.
[223:23.25]Dump to the church to acquire a mission.
[223:41.40]It all started with a large, dense gas.
[224:02.08]Yes, go in the church.
[224:05.10]What?
[224:05.44]Why is everyone freaking out?
[224:07.06]What's going on?
[224:07.66]Okay.
[224:10.84]Wonsky files.
[224:14.13]Bruce, this is a partial decrypt.
[224:16.79]I've also discovered an audio file.
[224:19.39]It sounds like a surveillance tape of some kind.
[224:21.83]Listen.
[224:23.09]You placed a prisoner inside the inner vault in direct contradiction to my orders and you've established a level 15 clearance.
[224:29.90]The president's senior cabinet members...
[224:32.66]surely you of all people don't need a lesson in protocol general well what are they talking about is mission directive a person put a cork board back there I don't need a cork board although I do love the noise that a cork board makes when you push a pin into it when it goes that
[225:06.74]How do I do the story mission?
[225:09.42]Acquire mission.
[225:10.78]Next story mission.
[225:11.58]Proving grounds.
[225:13.42]Oh, this is right here.
[225:16.38]That's you killing somebody.
[225:18.20]What?
[225:18.34]When am I going to have a Funko Pop?
[225:37.59]Who would buy one of those?
[225:40.39]Would you buy a Jerm of Funko Pop and put on your shelf?
[225:54.25]If I ever did like a Funko Pop, I would just cover it in inside jokes and references that didn't exist.
[226:01.25]You know, I'd be in like a beach towel.
[226:06.74]It'd be like a Rubik's Cube on my shoulder.
[226:12.07]Oh, my God.
[226:12.65]There's got to be some funny thing going on there.
[226:14.59]I would just have a bunch of it all over me.
[226:20.29]None of it would mean anything.
[226:22.01]Ooh, his boss fight.
[226:32.86]Well, that wasn't fair.
[226:39.54]Oh, shit.
[226:42.54]Eat car.
[226:44.18]Eat car.
[226:48.92]Did he just say, don't worry, the cavalry's here?
[226:55.14]I think he actually did just say that.
[227:04.59]Did he actually say that?
[227:09.82]I'm just asking.
[227:11.74]Solve a Rubik's Cube.
[227:13.90]Solve a Rubik's Cube on stream.
[227:15.93]Oh, this is gonna suck ass.
[227:19.35]Alright, go take out the...
[227:37.30]Kill it!
[227:43.62]Oh shit, the- the- the- the bomb has showed up.
[228:04.35]Die!
[228:18.16]One more.
[228:23.15]Nope.
[228:33.13]Yeah, I know.
[228:33.69]Oh, here come four more of these guys.
[228:36.29]This is not going to be good.
[228:37.25]I got to destroy these now.
[228:43.68]I don't know what the hell I just did there, but it was bad.
[228:51.72]Got it.
[228:53.04]Don't kill me, please.
[228:54.90]Get the muffler, get the muffler, get the muffler!
[229:03.49]Oof.
[229:09.47]Who's hurting who right now?
[229:19.47]Okay, get out.
[229:21.02]I don't have enough health for this.
[229:29.78]Jesus!
[229:30.47]No, throw it at the big guys!
[230:03.75]Jesus.
[230:04.05]Jesus.
[230:09.77]All the satellites are dead, right?
[230:18.54]Help.
[230:25.52]Help.
[230:33.42]Come here!
[230:34.78]Ugh!
[230:35.32]Where's the big one?
[230:51.18]You're not still alive, are you?
[231:10.14]So many missiles too many missiles man too many oh My god an endless supply of trucks to drop
[231:32.84]Next slide, please.
[231:51.01]That's funny.
[231:52.21]That was funny.
[231:52.77]Alright, so he only has one more fucking health bar left.
[231:58.03]I gotta just get in there and stop just beating the shit out of him.
[231:59.99]I'm gonna do the super fast punch.
[232:03.02]We got ready?
[232:08.30]That's never even going to work, man.
[232:21.21]That move will never be used.
[232:23.62]You will never use that move.
[232:25.84]You have to stand in the same spot for like 8 seconds to have that move happen.
[232:29.40]That's not going to happen.
[232:35.37]He's mad?
[232:37.23]Yeah!
[232:38.93]Why am I not allowed to be angry?
[232:43.97]Of course I'm gonna be like, fuck!
[232:45.31]Stupid shit!
[232:46.31]Fuck!
[232:47.91]I'm stupid.
[232:48.61]I'm not gonna say that.
[232:49.37]Of course I am.
[232:58.87]This motherfucker has a shield.
[233:10.52]Oh fuck.
[233:15.70]Well at least there's health up there.
[233:21.88]Sir.
[233:22.14]I'm losing my kids game.
[233:30.96]Not that everything is a kids game.
[233:33.34]Not everything is a kids game!
[233:40.91]This definitely has to be a kids game.
[233:50.02]He has a whole other health bar too.
[233:51.52]Fuck.
[233:55.86]Video games are for babies.
[234:00.82]What's the ESRB rating on this?
[234:02.87]T.
[234:03.65]13.
[234:03.67]Okay.
[234:07.51]That means that there's violence.
[234:08.53]That means there could be swear words.
[234:15.63]I just baited the fuck out of him so bad.
[234:17.61]Didn't really help me though.
[234:31.26]Yup.
[234:34.66]Oh, we both had the same idea.
[234:42.75]No!
[234:43.11]I got it.
[234:52.32]What the fuck just happened?
[234:53.84]Kim wants to know why you're grunting?
[234:57.02]Well... Why can't I jump like that?
[234:58.88]Why can't he get sucked into a Willy Wonka tube?
[235:02.41]Why can't I do that?
[235:22.52]It's because I'm playing an intense video game.
[235:35.21]50,000 points.
[235:35.57]Cool.
[235:37.53]Tornado Frenzy.
[235:38.39]Ooh, you can combo in the air.
[235:42.73]Yep, I want this.
[235:44.35]How expensive was that?
[235:46.93]Critical Thunderclap.
[235:50.49]Club Smash?
[235:54.36]Ooh.
[235:55.74]Cool.
[235:57.58]Rising uppercut.
[236:01.32]Cool little move.
[236:03.14]Air ground slam.
[236:06.32]Sounds cool.
[236:10.38]Nice.
[236:16.32]Kim said he's outside of his office with me?
[236:19.50]What?
[236:21.73]Me?
[236:22.03]I'm out there?
[236:23.84]How am I out there?
[236:25.47]Oh, auto.
[236:26.23]Okay, let's get a story recap.
[236:38.51]Kim confirmed.
[236:39.41]Pre-recorded.
[236:46.34]Oh, mercy.
[236:58.25]Why does this look better than the Wii game?
[237:00.98]The Wii came out after the Xbox, didn't it?
[237:03.12]This is on the... But here's another thing, though.
[237:13.67]This is Xbox 360 emulating the Xbox game.
[237:16.83]And let me tell you something.
[237:20.49]Of all the systems that have emulated backwards compatibility, the 360 with original Xbox games...
[237:28.15]This shit is phenomenal.
[237:31.00]This looks fantastic.
[237:35.30]It's phenomenal.
[237:40.58]This is an original Xbox game.
[237:42.02]This looks like it could have came out like five years ago.
[237:47.55]Well, maybe ten.
[237:49.25]Ten's probably pushing it.
[237:50.09]Maybe like fifteen.
[237:52.21]Which is when it did come out.
[237:53.51]So, let's just say whatever.
[237:54.83]Whatever.
[237:57.77]Alright, acquire a mission.
[238:02.18]Where do I want to go?
[238:03.02]Badlands?
[238:05.66]Jump to the city.
[238:12.76]The original Xbox supported 720p.
[238:15.02]Yeah, pretty good.
[238:19.84]Oh no.
[238:22.46]Why did it show this to me?
[238:31.25]I'm going to have to give a couple of criticisms of this burger, by the way.
[238:33.79]Lettuce on the bottom of the meat and lettuce on top.
[238:36.49]By the way, that's not even lettuce.
[238:37.29]That's like kale.
[238:39.01]That is kale.
[238:43.91]Where's the cheese?
[238:45.71]Lettuce, tomato.
[238:47.23]Way too thick of a patty.
[238:49.11]You got to cut that in half.
[238:50.41]I don't like big, thick burgers like that.
[238:52.39]No, thank you.
[238:53.57]The lettuce underneath.
[238:57.44]I don't think this is just not made right.
[239:09.27]What can I say about that?
[239:13.69]Bad news.
[239:14.79]Blonsky's developed a new Hulkbuster mech.
[239:18.01]No, that's a real criticism.
[239:19.10]That's a gross hamburger.
[239:21.20]Who for?
[239:22.40]Everyone, I guess.
[239:23.74]We'll have to get in there and take these new machines out.
[239:26.24]The specs and locations are uploaded into your subliminal program.
[239:29.48]Wait, Kim.
[239:30.02]Kim, no, no, no, no, no, no, Kim, don't.
[239:31.98]Don't, don't, don't, don't talk about all the other, don't talk about all the other Funko Pops that we own.
[239:37.76]Um, don't.
[239:40.35]Don't do that.
[239:41.49]I said, we only have four.
[239:42.53]I said, we only have four.
[239:44.61]We don't have like 12.
[239:46.65]Don't, don't do that.
[239:48.67]Don't talk, but we don't have to, we have four and they're on the shelf right now.
[239:56.25]It's definitely not at least 10.
[241:12.12]Ugh.
[241:45.70]Some of these are not mine.
[241:48.80]I just want to make sure where this, like, some of these, Kim has gotten some of these.
[241:53.73]The ones that are mine are the ones that I showed you.
[241:55.51]Except, of course, for Ren and Stimpy.
[241:56.85]I got those two because I like that show.
[242:01.35]I got Mega Man and Proto, and is it Proto Man?
[242:07.38]I got them too.
[242:09.61]And then Sailor Mars, Sailor Chun-Li, those are not mine.
[242:17.66]Those are Kim's.
[242:21.18]Chun-Li's not mine.
[242:24.01]Kim wanted Chun-Li.
[242:26.29]And there's also the little egg guy.
[242:28.41]That's not mine either.
[242:33.07]Why are they in the box?
[242:34.26]Because they...
[242:36.04]You don't take them out of the box.
[242:37.88]You're going to get your fingerprints on them and you're going to get Cheeto dust on them and then they're going to lose value.
[242:57.43]There are like 20 more downstairs.
[243:07.71]No, I'm kidding.
[243:08.96]This is it.
[243:09.80]This is it.
[243:10.26]I had to come clean.
[243:11.02]I came clean right here.
[243:13.18]I came clean.
[243:14.30]That's me coming clean.
[243:15.94]There it is.
[243:17.76]The haplos aren't even mine.
[243:18.74]The haplos aren't even mine.
[243:28.36]Oh, he's got BoxBox just raided with like 2,000 people.
[243:31.37]What's up, BoxBox?
[243:33.27]Thanks for the raid.
[243:35.61]What does BoxBox have to say about my fucking Reddit room?
[243:40.23]I know, I know it's dark.
[243:41.69]I'm working on the lighting in here.
[243:45.49]Look, let me tell you.
[243:46.93]Look at those.
[243:48.49]I only had four displayed up there.
[243:53.61]Thanks for the fucking raid, dude.
[244:01.20]You're a nerd.
[244:01.88]You're a nerd.
[244:02.78]Look at this Redditor.
[244:03.76]Reddit, Reddit, Reddit.
[244:06.03]I'm sorry.
[244:06.53]We're going to go over these one by one and we're going to talk about if Reddit would want them or not.
[244:09.97]Okay?
[244:10.85]Let's be honest.
[244:12.38]Chun Li.
[244:15.08]Ding.
[244:15.68]Okay.
[244:16.56]Ding, ding, ding.
[244:17.28]Sure.
[244:17.98]Fine.
[244:19.80]Brandon Stimpy.
[244:22.98]No.
[244:23.68]Half the people on Reddit don't even know what that show is.
[244:26.43]No.
[244:28.75]Proto Man.
[244:29.55]Ding, ding, ding.
[244:30.23]Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[244:31.81]Like ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[244:33.35]That's a huge... Absolutely.
[244:35.92]Mega Man.
[244:38.14]Proto Man's like cooler than Mega Man, right?
[244:41.70]Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[244:42.80]Yeah, ding, ding, ding.
[244:44.26]Roger Rabbit.
[244:45.30]Don't fucking think so.
[244:47.42]Roger Rabbit would not be.
[244:49.32]By the way, like this has got to go.
[244:51.02]I'm going to cut this off with my bare hands in a minute.
[244:54.50]There's no way Roger Rabbit is a Reddit Funko Pop.
[244:59.47]There's no fucking way.
[245:03.53]Why would?
[245:04.25]No, no way.
[245:07.14]Slimer.
[245:09.70]No, I don't think so.
[245:11.50]I don't think so.
[245:12.24]No.
[245:13.94]Q-Bert.
[245:14.64]Nobody knows who the fucking Q-Bert is.
[245:15.86]Only I do.
[245:17.06]Only I know who Q-Bert is.
[245:18.50]Okay.
[245:20.50]Carnage.
[245:20.90]I'll give that to you.
[245:23.24]Rush the Dog.
[245:25.80]Rush the Dog from Mega Man.
[245:27.32]That would be huge on Reddit, wouldn't it?
[245:31.79]Yeah.
[245:32.97]Taylor Mars.
[245:33.73]That would be huge on Reddit.
[245:35.67]Wouldn't it?
[245:38.31]Okay, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[245:41.83]There are 12 there.
[245:43.25]Two of them wouldn't be on Reddit.
[246:03.02]I like those shows, alright?
[246:05.12]I like Reddit.
[246:06.02]I like Stimpy.
[246:07.08]I like...
[246:08.48]Roger Rabbit and IQbert!
[246:27.36]I don't even give a shit.
[246:28.66]I don't even care about Q-Bert.
[246:31.28]Guys, I think I've played the first level of Q-Bert three times when I was like six.
[246:38.14]And I just walked off the edge and died.
[246:40.82]I just got Q-Bert because I want people to think I'm like a gamer and like Q-Bert and stuff.
[246:45.01]It's like a cool thing, like an old arcade thing.
[246:49.25]I don't even like Q-Bert.
[246:54.69]He's a fake fan.
[246:55.83]That's fine.
[246:58.43]I thought people were going to look at that and be like, oh, nice Q-Bert, man.
[247:00.93]That's fucking sick.
[247:03.87]Q-Bert is cool.
[247:05.13]And maybe he swears.
[247:07.03]Don't you guys think that's cool?
[247:09.93]What am I doing?
[247:14.04]You just explained Reddit at its core.
[247:21.39]No, I didn't.
[247:22.51]No, I didn't.
[247:23.05]It's for... It's for... I, like, Reddit's fine.
[247:27.01]It's a place for news and for pop culture and for up-to-date being able to stay up-to-date.
[247:33.30]Guys, I have a Reddit account.
[247:36.24]I've posted on it, like, three times.
[247:38.96]Alright, I'm just... Alright, let's go.
[247:41.92]By the way, I think every single person left from that raid.
[247:45.34]They were just like, alright, I'm out of here.
[247:48.18]This guy's got red and stippy Funko Pops.
[247:52.89]God, if he only like fell off a cliff.
[247:57.57]What's happening?
[248:13.88]They were uncomfortable with your shelf.
[248:17.43]I have to travel here.
[248:19.37]What do I have to fight these guys?
[248:24.23]This is brutal.
[248:25.48]It's brutal.
[248:27.32]It's not brutal.
[248:29.26]You can have Funko Pops.
[248:31.88]And not have to use the website reddit.com God damn it.
[248:36.36]I knew it.
[248:38.25]What would be back there that you guys would be happy with?
[248:40.93]You know, that's my question.
[248:44.63]Like a live rattlesnake?
[248:46.59]Would that be better for you?
[248:47.77]It's sitting there out of a cage.
[249:03.70]A skull.

[249:14.43]And I'm going to make sure that it's on Reddit.
[249:17.97]How do you make one?
[249:20.63]You should put an ant farm back there.

[249:59.15]For you to be able to watch stuff that's not allowed in your country or something?
[250:01.73]What is that?
[250:16.21]Chat hates Funko Pups but will buy a U2s.

[254:11.11]This could be anyone.
[254:24.72]Like, a Funko of me would look... It would just be this.
[254:28.97]But it could be anybody.
[254:29.89]It could be literally anyone.
[254:30.81]It's new.
[254:35.12]Our product's new.
[254:39.92]At first, I thought that was $899.

[254:57.37]Like, I have brown long hair, and like, I just put like a, I'm just like, I would look exactly like half of these Funko Pops that exist.

[272:22.02]He's already, he's gone.
[272:26.76]He's gonna get all of his health back, like every single cent of it.
[272:30.36]Look at how far away he is.
[272:39.15]He went across the entire city.
[272:42.71]The entire city.
[272:45.67]He's still, where is he?
[273:08.09]What?
[273:08.41]Was this supposed to happen?
[273:18.22]It was scripted.
[273:19.34]I thought... I thought he was just getting the fuck away from me.
[273:29.64]People are nexting this game because of this performance.
[273:32.46]Well, I'll be... What is happening?
[273:36.52]Dude, the performance of this game is just a firework exploding in your face.
[273:39.81]This whole game.
[273:42.25]I can't believe you.
[273:46.37]What's with this performance of you holding a fucking Roman candle up to your eye?
[273:52.66]You lit a piece of dynamite and held it in your hand.
[273:55.66]You could have done that a little smoother, I think.
[274:15.08]Dude, what the fuck?
[274:21.14]I need fucking help!
[274:26.62]Why does this whole game have to have people that shoot missiles?
[274:30.90]It's just this constant missiles going past your screen.
[274:37.01]There's not been one moment of this game where a missile has not gone
[274:58.15]It says fucking missiles.
[275:02.48]If only... I'm bot... No, I'm not.
[275:06.54]Get me out of here.
[275:07.14]I need to get like the fucking anti-missile move.
[275:24.85]Where's this?
[275:25.27]Where is this fucking thing?
[275:35.54]Alright, pick up large vehicles and just hold them.
[275:40.22]Okay, I'm getting more moves.
[275:58.47]I'm going to do a couple of those other ones.
[276:04.14]I need to get some more points.
[276:05.16]I want new moves.
[276:06.37]That was the wrong move.
[276:17.19]There's another shield?
[276:18.43]I thought that was the one that I needed.
[276:20.07]Alright, I'm going to do these two missions here.
[276:28.93]It's a punch rockets move.
[276:35.29]Serious.
[276:38.13]Tell me it's not this.
[276:39.13]Is this shit even working?
[276:48.72]It works.
[276:51.44]Sort of.
[277:01.80]Go by.
[277:03.38]Go by.
[277:05.06]Whatever.
[277:09.35]I thought he was safe.
[277:10.83]I'm going this way.
[277:13.89]I'm just going to do some of these missions.
[277:21.21]Race.
[277:21.75]Okay.
[277:24.85]I shield grind.
[277:32.78]Wait, the same people made hit and run?
[277:34.32]Really?
[277:39.82]No, they didn't.
[277:57.76]No, I didn't want to do that.
[277:59.55]It's so finicky.
[278:00.73]And I can't even... On your screen, it looks like, oh, wow, he's so dumb.
[278:04.51]He can't even jump in the right way.
[278:05.72]But it's like you glue on to shit.
[278:09.16]It's weird.
[278:10.14]Trust me.
[278:46.40]Down?
[278:46.90]What?
[278:47.76]Oh my fuck!
[278:53.79]Get it!
[278:56.01]Stop doing backflips!
[278:58.55]You motherfucker!
[279:00.19]And stop gluing to walls!
[279:12.38]Where is this one?
[279:31.51]Where's the last one?
[279:35.49]Ah!
[279:41.45]Ah!
[279:51.45]Having a cranky wanky.
[279:54.42]8.9 out of 10.
[279:55.38]Same.
[279:57.64]Guys, that's the same score I gave Outer Wilds.
[280:18.12]What?
[280:18.54]Hey, you were supposed to go this way.
[280:21.16]He hated Outer Wilds.
[280:22.50]No, I didn't.
[280:23.30]Why did I even say that?
[280:24.25]People are going to think I'm being like, why?
[280:25.67]Are you trying to say this is bad?
[280:26.91]This one's bad?
[280:27.41]What is he trying to say?
[280:30.91]He's trying to say this one's bad?
[280:32.33]Oh.
[280:43.46]Should I go for it?
[280:44.86]Just do it.
[280:46.46]Just do it.
[280:49.50]Just do it.
[280:49.98]I'm just gonna do it.
[280:50.88]I'm gonna fucking just be quiet and I'm gonna beat this right now.
[280:53.12]Ready?
[280:56.08]I'm gonna beat this right now.
[280:58.36]Do a trauma impression.
[280:59.24]Okay.
[280:59.62]Sure.
[281:00.20]Good.
[281:00.90]I'm gonna beat it right now.
[281:05.65]Quiet.
[281:05.97]Go.
[281:06.23]Go in now.
[281:07.35]I want all teams to concentrate fire on Banner.
[281:09.81]Don't let him...
[281:14.18]Oh.
[282:18.98]Don't look at his tight jeans, Jeremy.
[282:23.12]Okay, I won't.
[282:25.12]I won't do that.
[282:25.78]Alright, do I have full health?
[282:40.59]I do.
[282:41.21]Let's move.
[282:41.93]I'm taking this shit with me.
[282:45.73]Wait, no.
[282:46.19]Give me the bust and turn it into a shield.
[282:53.33]Look at my tight jeans.
[283:00.17]Alright, cool.
[283:02.03]Stop imagining him in spandex.
[283:04.69]No, I'm not going to stop imagining that because I think that's more... His energy and his source and his kinetic movements would be better in spandex.
[283:13.24]I'm not going to not imagine that.
[283:30.88]Shit actually works really good as a weapon to Charge it
[283:57.81]You should not be able to get grabbed in this game.
[283:59.01]It's not fair.
[283:59.37]You shouldn't be able to get grabbed.
[284:01.65]It's just like a bad game.
[284:19.11]Yeah.
[284:19.89]Oh my god.
[284:35.56]Kick it!
[284:39.50]Critical mass!
[284:42.14]Do it!
[284:54.73]How much health do you have?
[285:00.59]That was a good headbutt.
[285:04.30]Okay, here it comes.
[285:07.41]Let's go.
[285:07.97]I want a weapon for this.
[285:15.03]If you beat this, we'll take you to GameStop and you can get any Funko Pop you want.
[285:21.74]Hmm.
[285:25.54]Cool, that sounds like... Any Funko Pop I want?
[285:32.23]Nice.
[285:33.05]Hey, tipped over.
[285:33.67]Thanks for the five subs.
[285:34.39]Appreciate it.
[285:35.78]Tipped over.
[285:41.48]Let's make this shit quick.
[286:06.24]No, I didn't want to throw it.
[286:33.78]Fuck out of here.
[286:48.89]Why are you still here?
[286:50.57]Fuck off!
[287:04.44]Okay, fine.
[287:05.12]I'll leave then.
[287:11.68]Imagine locking on to somebody and your character swings the other direction.
[287:15.21]Can you imagine, imagine, imagine, imagine, imagine?
[287:18.89]There he is again.
[287:19.45]Get the fuck away.
[287:32.16]We don't need 50 fucking missile launcher guys on every fucking rooftop in the fucking game.
[287:46.80]Now get out of here.
[287:48.46]Wait.
[287:49.06]Catch him.
[288:04.29]Holy shit!
[288:06.81]I just hit him.
[288:08.91]Don't fucking die to this.
[288:09.97]This has got to be held somewhere.
[288:11.91]Please.
[288:12.39]No.
[288:12.81]Please.
[288:13.25]God.
[288:13.91]Do not die to this.
[288:15.99]I don't care if he runs away.
[288:17.49]I need health.
[288:18.03]This guy hurts so much.
[288:23.01]Fuck.
[288:24.13]Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[288:24.91]Make it a shield, quick.
[288:26.19]Make it a shield.
[288:27.93]Make it a shield.
[288:29.53]Just don't move and regenerate all your health.
[288:34.72]Okay, where is he?
[288:36.62]I think he's right behind me.
[288:38.52]Is he right behind me?
[288:39.82]He's right behind me, isn't he?
[288:43.92]oh oh boy fuck you ah get rid of the tank
[289:12.40]Need that help in there.
[289:13.48]He grabbed me.
[289:17.13]And he instantly killed me.
[289:27.49]The Hulk isn't supposed to get scared.
[289:29.05]This is not like his character.
[289:31.71]Okay.
[289:37.52]Heal.
[289:37.86]Right here.
[289:48.23]And all of a sudden, he's just up my ass.
[289:51.97]The last time I fought this guy, he was running the fuck away from me.
[289:54.62]Where's the script that I run away from you scene?
[289:56.70]Target acquired.
[289:59.38]Don't move.
[290:05.18]I have contact.
[290:07.96]I have contact.
[290:29.92]Alright, he's dead.
[290:33.42]Here he goes.
[290:34.00]Is he gonna fly away?
[290:37.09]No.
[290:37.63]Can I just kill him here?
[290:38.39]Here he goes.
[290:47.91]Wait, where is he?
[290:48.67]Is he running away?
[290:51.78]I can't tell.
[290:52.26]The fucking 4th of July finale keeps playing.
[290:57.44]Alright, yeah, there he goes.
[291:18.60]I'm doing like Peter Griffin.
[291:21.24]That was going into Peter Griffin territory there.
[291:24.71]It started off alright, but then it started going to like... I'd stop immediately.
[291:34.01]I can't break free!
[291:54.80]Mmm, full health.
[291:58.80]Critical strike.
[292:03.02]What about Peter?
[292:04.10]What about Peter?
[292:08.88]It's scripted.
[292:09.60]This guy doesn't even know it's a scripted event.
[292:11.38]How was I supposed to fucking know?
[292:14.62]The only instructions I had was kill guy.
[292:17.42]Okay.
[292:32.08]Kill guy smash.
[292:39.31]Oh, you're good.
[292:40.89]You're good, aren't you?
[292:43.81]Alright, this is where he lands.
[292:46.67]He's healing.
[292:47.65]Yeah, this is just what happens.
[292:48.81]It's scripted.
[292:52.26]I can't catch him.
[292:52.86]Guys, he has wings.
[292:54.28]He can fly.
[292:58.57]I'm just a big guy that weighs like 2,200 pounds or something.
[293:03.09]That's it.
[293:03.45]I don't do anything else.
[293:04.13]The Hulk doesn't do anything else.
[293:06.47]He's just a huge guy that weighs 2,000 pounds.
[293:08.45]That's it.
[293:12.03]Here we go.
[293:22.78]This is it.
[293:25.78]He's a living nuclear bomb.
[293:35.27]That's kind of cool.
[293:39.69]Now you're in my territory.
[293:51.96]In like a little corridor.
[293:54.26]What the fuck were you thinking guy with a jetpack?
[293:57.27]That was stupid of you.
[294:02.91]You know what else was stupid?
[294:03.99]Getting too close to the nuclear bomb.
[294:14.97]Get away from me!
[294:30.56]Get away from me!
[294:41.77]Oh, fuck.
[294:42.47]No, that does so much damage.
[294:43.73]Why does that do so much damage?
[294:45.07]That does so much damage.
[294:47.29]Oh, make sure you target the fucking guy.
[294:48.63]Make sure you target that guy.
[294:51.45]Oh, fuck.
[295:14.79]Come here, come here, come here!
[295:16.37]Come here!
[295:17.21]Come here!
[295:18.89]Where'd you get the tanks from?
[295:21.28]It kills me.
[295:22.04]I think, no, you better fucking not kill me.
[295:24.42]Oh my fucking god, I have to run now.
[295:27.76]Where'd he get all the fucking tanks from, man?
[295:30.20]Where'd he get all these tanks?
[295:32.04]Alright, hail mirror.
[295:32.99]I gotta just throw this tree behind me and I'm gonna get killed.
[295:34.85]I have to fucking... Oh my god.
[295:37.41]Oh my god.
[295:37.73]Oh my god.
[295:38.23]Oh my god.
[295:38.99]Oh my god.
[295:39.97]Oh my god.
[295:43.37]Why?
[295:44.15]Why?
[295:44.79]Why?
[295:46.95]What?
[295:49.33]Alright, Banner, that's enough out of you.
[295:57.26]Spawned eight tanks right behind the wall.
[296:00.70]I mean, might as well.
[296:02.00]He called in reinforcements.
[296:05.99]He was fucking dead, too.
[296:07.11]Oh, my God.
[296:21.26]I can't believe I have to do this shit.
[296:23.63]I can't believe he had that much health.
[296:25.79]He had one hit.
[296:27.69]Come on.
[296:28.17]What the fuck?
[296:54.83]Keep throwing shit at them.
[296:57.13]But it's... Okay, I know throw shit at them.
[297:00.31]But when 200 fucking projectiles are spammed on your screen... Like, the military doesn't even have this much firepower.
[297:08.74]This is not even possible.
[297:12.48]Like, the military doesn't even have this much power.
[297:16.42]This is like 8 different militaries here.
[297:19.44]There's like 12 different countries here in fucking, like, New York.
[297:22.53]Whatever the hell we are.
[297:38.22]Careful, we have more than 8 tanks.
[297:49.71]Yeah, do we?
[297:59.66]I guess maybe we do.
[298:07.50]I'm so sad.
[298:15.33]I can't believe I couldn't hit that guy with just one fucking move.
[298:19.23]Alright, we may have more tanks in this, but we definitely don't have this many missile launcher guys, okay?
[298:24.76]There's no way we have this many missile launcher guys.
[298:51.89]Just throw him.
[299:01.19]Just throw him.
[299:02.11]Take him out now.
[299:03.91]Do it.
[299:04.19]Do it.
[299:04.57]Look out.
[299:07.41]He's in my sight.
[299:21.98]What the fuck?
[299:32.95]No, you know what this is?
[299:34.61]We mentioned MMO, this is PvP in MMOs.
[299:38.97]Everybody has the same four moves and it's just a mess.
[299:58.86]Listen to chat, listen to chat.
[300:00.68]I thought you just said farts increases all damage.
[300:02.84]And I was about to say, I was about to ban you.
[300:04.70]But you said steel fists.
[300:18.62]Farts increase melee damage.
[300:22.40]Alright, this is it.
[300:23.26]I'm beating him right here, and then I'm going to bed.
[300:27.87]Give me steel fists.
[300:39.93]Okay, here we go.
[300:41.43]Don't fuck it up.
[300:42.53]And I'm going to clear out the bullshit.
[300:44.97]When we get to that next zone where he gets in the middle and he flies away and shit, I am going to kill everything there.
[300:51.23]I'm not going to let it get to a point where it is like 15, where every tank in America is on screen.
[300:58.00]Eight.
[300:58.24]All eight of them.
[300:59.32]I'm not going to get to that point again.
[301:06.44]I charge the jump, I'm doing it almost every time.
[301:10.02]I charge the jump 85% of the time.
[301:37.31]Go, go, go, go.
[301:37.93]Don't let him get away.
[301:40.57]Don't let him get away.
[301:45.50]Don't let him heal.
[302:09.34]Get over here.
[302:12.20]You piece of shit.
[302:15.24]Where you going?
[302:26.25]What's the matter?
[302:30.15]Something wrong?
[302:40.98]Alright, there he goes.
[302:41.68]No, not yet.
[302:42.96]I need to heal.
[302:43.64]I want to heal.
[302:45.10]Steel Fist again.
[302:45.80]Alright, now you get the fuck out of here.
[303:00.69]Steel Fist, give me another car.
[303:02.35]I'm not messing around right now.
[303:03.41]I'm going full on super trying as hard as I possibly can.
[303:10.13]Steel farts, that's right.
[303:24.28]You can only run in one direction.
[303:26.77]You can kind of curve your body, but you can't...
[303:41.16]Collectible?
[303:41.72]It's alright.
[303:44.18]I don't care about the collectible.
[303:45.10]I care about punching this guy's head until it explodes.
[303:49.63]That's what I care about.
[303:50.43]Yeah, I have... Why would you go that way?
[304:16.52]He's crazy!
[304:30.33]Absolutely bonkers.
[304:31.45]There we go.
[304:32.49]We don't care about the collectibles.
[304:36.63]We don't care about anything interesting.
[304:38.13]We just care about the game.
[304:40.50]The gameplay.
[304:41.32]Okay.
[304:45.54]Imagine that, right?
[304:46.82]Wait, actually, give me that thing.
[304:49.42]Okay, I got the pog point.
[304:51.59]Nice shorts, dude.
[305:01.96]Thanks.
[305:04.87]Alright, here we go.
[305:06.29]This is it.
[305:06.79]Gonna move one more time.
[305:09.75]And then I'm gonna start, I'm gonna, here we go.
[305:10.93]Kill the tanks and shit.
[305:13.21]I'm ready for this.
[305:19.26]Going right over there.
[305:21.62]I got full power.
[305:24.20]Let's go.
[305:24.62]Kill all tanks.
[305:25.56]Kill all things.
[305:27.20]Anything that moves, attack it.
[305:29.93]This guy's moving.
[305:32.03]Can't have that.
[305:41.53]Where am I?
[305:47.35]Here we go.
[305:48.01]Come on.
[305:48.43]This is it.
[306:07.46]He grabbed me!
[306:39.24]What the fuck?
[306:44.61]Oh.
[306:45.15]My.
[306:46.23]Fucking.
[306:46.91]God.
[306:48.61]Are.
[306:50.47]Uh.
[306:52.91]What?
[306:54.33]The fuck?
[307:04.79]Now I gotta run the fuck away.
[307:06.48]Two grabs.
[307:07.60]And I'm dead.
[307:10.64]Fuck, he's behind me.
[307:20.24]Get away from me, get away from me.
[307:25.84]Get the fuck away from me, please.
[307:28.56]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[307:34.77]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[307:36.91]We, uh, give me the vest.
[307:44.61]Where?
[307:54.03]Look, the tanks weren't even here before.
[307:56.41]You can't tell me this tank was fucking here.
[307:58.67]It wasn't even here.
[308:01.36]It wasn't even fucking here.
[308:07.44]Here we go.
[308:07.74]I'm going to fucking ready.
[308:08.64]Watch this.
[308:11.43]I can't believe it messed up.
[308:12.55]Are you going to grab me and kill me?
[308:21.93]Run.
[308:22.07]Run.
[308:29.04]Run away from him.
[308:31.98]He's coming.
[308:32.48]He's coming for me.
[308:53.48]Don't grab me.
[308:56.06]I can't see.
[308:56.56]Alright.
[309:09.11]Run.
[309:09.83]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[309:16.64]This is a coward move.
[309:17.92]We're doing full-on coward plays here.
[309:19.54]I don't care.
[309:33.77]No, no!
[309:36.19]No!
[309:38.01]No!
[309:39.61]No!
[309:41.09]What the fuck?
[309:42.65]Why does it have to do so much damage?
[309:55.58]Please don't kill me, please, please, please.
[309:57.10]Please, please, please.
[309:59.64]No!
[310:03.82]Lots of cars and shit here.
[310:12.64]No, don't throw that guy.
[310:19.41]Okay, don't get caught.
[310:20.45]He just hit himself with a car.
[310:21.89]I'm gonna run this way.
[310:22.73]Lady.
[310:23.39]Lady.
[310:35.46]Where'd he go?
[310:42.18]Oh!
[310:43.30]Just fuckin' die!
[310:45.86]Oh, come on, please!
[310:48.10]Just die!
[310:51.06]Oh, get up!
[310:54.18]I did it!
[310:56.98]Wait a minute, I didn't do it.
[310:57.82]Get up, run!
[311:03.36]Run, run, run.
[311:04.14]Get out, get out.
[311:04.82]Go, go, go, go.
[311:07.02]I have to teleport the fuck out of here.
[311:08.30]I don't want to do this again.
[311:12.39]Who's behind me?
[311:17.15]Don't even look behind you.
[311:20.93]Why would you look behind you?
[311:22.81]That's a mistake.
[311:24.45]Oh.
[311:38.79]I didn't even want to do that to that one.
[311:40.73]Okay, where's the jump point?
[311:42.01]I need to get to the jump pad.
[311:47.72]It's not a big deal, just get in there
[312:12.05]Okay.
[312:13.25]Good.
[312:14.15]I'll just get in it and jump out.
[312:18.79]Ah.
[312:22.80]Okay, we're good.
[312:28.62]That was fucking ridiculous.
[312:32.70]This game is fucking crazy.
[312:37.57]Ay, ay, ay.
[312:41.41]all I want is loyalty and patience I've been patient I'll be the judge of that I can't afford no more mistakes mercy not at this juncture oh alright well worried about you emile you should be I'm not stupid I know what Ross is doing what's happening to you nothing
[313:05.44]Who's that?
[313:06.00]Who can do that?
[313:06.57]What character is that?
[313:07.25]What character can do that?
[313:08.17]Me.
[313:40.67]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
[313:43.76]That's a good place to stop it.
[313:44.76]After complaining about the game for an hour while I lose to the same boss like four or five times.
[313:52.00]Then I finally do it.
[313:57.42]I think I might just play this again.
[313:59.26]I'm just going to beat it.
[313:59.98]I think I'll just beat this tomorrow.
[314:03.62]I could beat this game.
[314:05.10]Then I could say I beat this game.
[314:13.81]It's either that, or... There's a lot of shit I could play, but... I think there's like about another four hours of the game left.
[314:24.46]Maybe five.
[314:26.69]According to the how-long-does-this-game-take-to-beat.org, whatever it is.
[314:33.33]It actually is very fun.
[314:39.30]But, yeah.
[314:40.04]We'll continue tomorrow.
[314:40.76]I'll beat it tomorrow.
[314:46.92]And I'll see you then.
[314:48.28]Thanks for watching.
[314:49.43]Let me just check the internet here.
[314:53.65]This statement here says that I have no dropped frames.
[314:57.73]This is the first stream from the new internet.
[314:59.93]And it looks like... No, I have no dropped frames.
[315:12.26]F, F, F, F. Yeah, so that's a good sign.
[315:18.00]Good sign.
[315:21.04]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[315:23.64]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[315:24.76]We're going to do the bits and everything.
[315:25.62]We'll hang out for another few minutes.
[315:30.00]And I'll see you tomorrow for more Hulk.
[315:33.40]Punch walls and have missiles explode in your face.
[315:36.40]See you then.
[315:38.24]For those of you that are staying, we're obviously going to do the bits and subs and everything.
[315:46.41]And we will chill.
[315:48.66]Animal Crossing sure went well, huh?
[315:51.16]I kind of missed the boat on it because of the move.
[315:54.24]And it was one of those things that was just... It was being played off stream and it... That was like what was played while Kim and I were moving.
[316:03.94]So... Okay.
[316:13.01]So let's do the bits.
[316:18.51]Thanks again for joining me, everybody.
[316:19.57]Let's go back.
[316:22.45]Had SticksRenegade250 from SticksRenegade.
[316:27.37]Captain Nemo also signed it, but I was dumb and forgot to add them.
[316:30.85]I believe you're talking about the auto card.
[316:32.99]Really appreciate that.
[316:34.75]I'm going to show that to Kim.
[316:37.77]After the stream's over, I'll say, Kim, look at this.
[316:40.76]Very touching, very nice.
[316:41.70]Thank you, everybody.
[316:45.71]Wyatt Archer, thanks for 1,500 bits.

[319:06.94]There were a shitload of subs today.
[319:08.18]I know I've been gone for a while.
[319:09.34]And it shocks me when I come back from, like, four or five days in a row of not streaming.
[319:15.45]And it's, like, hundreds of you guys just fucking subscribe.

[319:50.50]Smellyboy, thanks for 250.
[319:51.77]Gotta say, I really like the Funko Pops and Pac-Man ghosts.
[319:54.09]They really help give off the mid to late 2000s angry video game nerd knockoff vibe.
[320:01.75]It's a Pac-Man ghost light.
[320:05.33]It was cute.
[320:07.21]I think it's cute.
[320:10.53]It was a gift.
[320:16.26]Yeah, Dark Soul says, nice apartment, man.

[320:42.30]Thank you, TwoHeadedBoy.
[320:44.06]Dr. Clay, thanks for $5.
[320:45.56]Out of curiosity, was the ladder in the background meant to be a joke at your expense?
[320:49.52]Or did you actually need that to reach the shelf?
[320:51.94]jermaSour, hope Otto is well.
[320:54.00]No, that was to reach the ceiling.
[320:55.14]That was to reach the ceiling.
[320:58.19]Uh, the ceilings... I don't know what houses you live in, but ceilings are not, like, five and a half feet tall.
[321:06.45]They're like... Some ceilings are like 12 to 15 feet high.
[321:15.77]If you can stand up in your room right now, put your arms up and touch the ceiling, you are fucking huge.
[321:23.76]You're huge.
[321:24.80]You're like 6'4".
[321:25.24]6'5".
[321:26.44]You have to be at least 6'3", 6'4", 6'5", to do that.
[321:36.01]And you have to stretch.
[321:39.25]You're like talking about hitting your head on the top of the door.
[321:41.14]Right.
[321:47.22]And by the way, it was to put foam up on the top of the walls, which you have to lean in and put a bunch of pressure on for it to stick there.
[321:58.31]6'4 is not huge.
[321:59.99]6'4 is fucking huge.
[322:03.75]Where do you live with 6'4s not huge?
[322:05.71]What?! !
[322:22.15]6'3 is average?
[322:27.69]You guys are fucking crazy.
[322:35.31]If you're like 6'4, 6'5, you are a monstrously tall- that's a tall person.
[322:48.10]Anything lower than 6'11 isn't human.
[322:56.32]6'4 is the world average for adult height.
[322:58.64]Holy fuck, that would be crazy.
[323:01.87]It's like 5'9 by the way, buddy.
[323:05.19]Anyways, I'm not gonna get like fucking trolled right now and like gaslit.
[323:09.65]We're gonna just move on.
[323:14.40]Thanks to lizard amiibo for the 250 it looks like you're in a basement closet with a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling Well, there's a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling Eventually here over the next few weeks.
[323:25.02]I'm gonna have some lighting in here I'm gonna get a couple of lights maybe one over here over there.
[323:29.41]I don't know.
[323:30.13]I just just got here It's a first stream from the new fiber
[323:44.59]Yeah, I see it.
[323:45.41]Yeah.
[323:45.75]And what's wrong with that?
[323:46.87]Look at that.
[323:47.71]They got more space there, too.
[323:49.39]That's fine.
[323:49.75]If you want to collect this shit, that's fine.
[323:51.34]What?
[323:51.52]Is this guy a Redditor or something?
[323:53.08]Is this person a Redditor because they have, like, a shelf of Funko Pops that they like?
[324:00.28]What if you said that to this person and this guy was like, I don't even know what that is.
[324:03.49]What is that?
[324:05.21]Reddit?
[324:06.23]I don't know what that is.
[324:07.67]What is that?
[324:13.22]That's impossible.
[324:14.34]No, it is possible.
[324:17.20]Find me something from The Witcher here and I will agree with you.
[324:22.30]I don't see anything Witcher related on this shelf.
[324:24.58]Therefore, cannot be a Redditor.
[324:39.71]What is this?
[324:40.29]Gold and bits and...
[324:43.91]I'm not going to leave a look at this image.
[324:47.27]Guys, what the... Why did I even hold up that thing and do that?
[324:51.31]Whatever.
[324:52.43]Anyways, thank you for the $2.50.
[324:54.83]Ocean Dweller, thanks for $2.50.
[324:55.63]Excuse me, Jerma, this is important.
[324:57.12]When did you say you put your milk in the eggs?
[325:01.40]Did you say you put your milk into the egg and then mix it and pour it into the pan?
[325:05.64]Yes.
[325:08.04]You put...
[325:10.97]2% whatever it is.
[325:11.43]Doesn't matter what milk it is.
[325:12.93]2%.
[325:13.33]Just don't do like almond milk.
[325:15.95]Or like soy milk or something.
[325:17.11]Just regular milk is better because it makes the eggs fluffy and there's a lot of big fat.
[325:20.87]So you pour a little bit of milk in there.
[325:22.47]Beat them up.
[325:24.99]Add a little bit of pepper.
[325:25.75]Beat, beat, beat, beat, beat.
[325:26.79]Put a bunch of parmesan.
[325:28.37]Not shaved parmesan.
[325:29.99]We're talking like the powder shit.
[325:32.77]Powdered parmesan cheese.
[325:34.73]Beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat.
[325:36.19]To your liking.
[325:37.81]And scramble them.
[325:38.61]You will love it.
[325:39.19]I guarantee it.
[325:44.53]You're gonna like it.
[325:45.47]Parmesan pepper eggs.
[325:46.52]Trust me, they're my specialty.
[325:52.80]Hey, Fancy Jack, thanks for $5.
[325:54.22]Jerma, I love you.
[325:57.18]Do you, though?
[325:59.68]Hmm.

[326:25.34]Why won't you say it?
[326:26.50]Why won't you say it back?
[326:28.40]What the fuck?
[326:32.51]Jerma sucks.
[326:33.29]He won't say it back.

[326:52.57]It's very special.
[326:56.14]Please buy this.
[327:09.08]Hold on, there's a Mr. Bean turkey head?
[327:13.76]What?
[327:14.16]Is this real?
[327:17.54]Is this actually real?
[327:22.42]Of course I'm going to buy this.
[327:23.31]Is this rare?
[327:24.69]This is not like a Dumbo where it's $6,500, right?
[327:30.03]That's so funny.
[327:31.23]You probably weren't here when we went over the turkey thing.
[327:38.74]$42?
[327:38.78]That's kind of... That's like $5 to $10 more than I'm willing to pay for something like that.

[328:33.99]Thanks for the $25.
[328:35.11]That's a lot of fucking money.
[328:36.05]You guys give a shitload of money to this stream.
[328:38.30]You guys give so much money to this stream.
[328:39.94]It's unbelievable.
[328:40.70]It's insane.

[329:02.11]Like I got like Seaman up there.
[329:04.97]I got Binding of Isaac board game thing.
[329:07.13]Like that's cool.
[329:08.71]You guys are focusing on one item that happened to be up there for fun for one day.
[329:15.63]You're focusing too hard on the Proto Man Funko Pop and you're not focusing enough on the thing for PC being displayed.
[329:30.85]Hey, stains!

[331:12.05]looking at the shelf they're not multiplying you know what would be funny oh I'm my it's like part of me just wants to do it and just do it I don't care how much money it costs every stream going forward every week five it's like two to three get added to this shelf and I never talk about it until it is full with like 60 funko pops behind me and I never say a goddamn word about it
[331:42.25]But then I think about the future and the future of that.
[331:45.61]That means what am I going to do with like a hundred Funko Pops?
[331:48.44]What the fuck am I going to do with those?
[331:50.10]They're just going to take up a shitload of space and I don't want them.
[331:57.53]Just give them away?
[331:58.73]I could.
[331:59.09]We'll see.

[338:36.91]And... What's this thing's name?
[338:41.90]What's it?
[338:45.50]Gudetama?
[338:47.38]Gudetama?
[338:48.14]Gudetama.
[338:49.22]I don't know what that is.
[338:49.86]It's like an egg thing.
[338:51.28]It's Kim's.
[338:58.46]You didn't see the Q-Bert movie?
[338:59.54]What, his 12-second appearance in Wreck-It Ralph?
[339:03.63]No, I haven't seen that movie.
[339:04.49]You're right.
[339:09.85]Anyways, thank you to Dork Cube for the $2.50.
[339:12.03]The question of what happens to food in Hulk's stomach when he transforms back into Bruce Banner is actually answered in one of the Marvel zombie comics.
[339:21.68]If I remember correctly, the Hulk eats like five people, and then when he transforms back, all the people's bones that weren't dissolved by the stomach acid poke through his rotting skin.
[339:33.72]Okay, now what happens if he's not a zombie?
[339:36.78]Will that same thing happen?
[339:38.62]And will it just kill Bruce Banner?
[339:42.66]Like, if the Hulk were to eat five people and not be a zombie, when he shrinks down, would they just poke out through 40 parts of his body and just fucking kill him and, like, blood everywhere and shit?
[339:57.85]Hmm.
[339:59.75]Nice shower thought.
[340:03.51]Also, I missed a $50 donation from Vimthral.
[340:09.19]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[340:10.35]They say I'm paying you this much to never talk about Hulk piss ever again.
[340:15.05]I don't remember what it was.
[340:17.82]What was it?
[340:20.12]Also, I still want to put the nose of that one Final Fantasy character in my mouth.
[340:28.14]Ooh.
[340:30.42]The nose of that one Final Fantasy character.
[340:35.75]Hulk is a vegan.
[340:37.83]You don't even know that.
[340:49.33]It's because he's green.
[340:51.25]Oh, you're thinking of the jolly green giant.
[340:53.95]That's the guy that has the frozen peas and shit.
[340:57.66]And he might be a vegan.
[340:58.58]I don't know.
[341:09.68]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[341:11.18]Thanks, Yoda985 for the 250.
[341:13.53]Speaking of the Hulk eating people, in the current Hulk run, the Hulk is dissected and taken apart.
[341:23.45]And then... Okay, but what if I... I don't want to... What if this is like a spoiler of the story, though?
[341:30.28]Like, I mean, I've read the first part, but the second part could be like a spoiler or something.
[341:38.28]Hold on.
[341:38.66]I saved it, right?
[341:41.24]Nobody reads comics?
[341:44.04]No, but talk about the ending to the nineteen fucking eighties Willy Wonka movie and all of a sudden I'm- I'm- Oh, everything is so bad, Jerma.
[341:52.24]Every- I'm sorry everything's so bad for you.
[342:01.29]I'm gonna think about that like every time I complain about like anything.
[342:04.93]That comment's gonna stick with me for a decade.
[342:08.07]I'm gonna be in... I have so many, like, daily little annoyances.
[342:13.05]I'm gonna be in, like, line somewhere, like, eventually.
[342:16.45]Or I'm gonna, like... Something's gonna happen where I'm putting together, like, a... Something for the office, and I'm gonna be like, this fucking stupid thing.
[342:23.20]What a piece of shit.
[342:24.20]I'm so fucking in, I'm gonna think of that person.
[342:26.40]Oh, wow, everything's so bad, huh, Jeremy?
[342:28.86]And I'm gonna be like, fuck, that person's just fucking with me.
[342:30.96]They're always in my head.
[342:32.28]And it's... They're right... Okay, I'm gonna slow down here.
[342:37.91]Omega Lolthus.
[342:43.13]Oh, sorry.
[342:44.01]What I meant to say was Clown Room.
[342:50.75]Hey, Door Cube.
[342:51.47]Thanks for the $2.50, Door Cube $7,000.
[342:56.35]I'm almost certain someone has already suggested this, but you should play Prototype 2.
[342:59.23]The movement mechanics and beat-em-up gameplay are similar to this game.
[343:02.65]I just played through it recently, and I might suggest playing it on hard.
[343:05.05]Because once you upgrade, your power is past a certain point, and none of the enemies are threatening.
[343:09.91]I tried to play Prototype.
[343:12.18]There was a lot of problems with it.
[343:13.18]And I wanted to do them both.
[343:16.40]But I got to Prototype 1, and there was like a bunch of frame problems.
[343:20.28]I'm not sure what it was.
[343:21.46]Did anyone remember...
[343:28.35]It's because I think I was trying to play it on PC, and there was some problem with it.
[343:31.39]I would have to just play it on, like, Xbox or something.
[343:35.68]Or on, like, PS4.
[343:36.30]Yeah.
[343:38.92]Yeah, no, it's something I wanted to play.
[343:40.12]I mean, I tried to stream it, like, a couple years ago, so... We'll see.
[343:44.30]Uh, King Swagus, thanks for the thousand bits.
[343:46.80]Here's some money to fund Rat Movie 3's development.
[343:52.02]Okay.
[343:52.70]Thank you.
[343:55.02]Thanks for the ten bucks.
[343:56.93]Hey, xxdeadlydonut.
[343:59.23]Thanks for the $5.
[344:00.09]Jerma, today's my birthday.
[344:01.05]Happy fucking birthday.
[344:03.04]I was happy to see that you were streaming today.
[344:04.52]Thank you for keeping myself and others entertained during this weird time.
[344:07.82]Also, shout out to my brother, John, for introducing me to your stream.
[344:11.58]Thanks to your E3 stream last year.
[344:14.41]Stay safe.
[344:15.09]We love you.
[344:17.01]Happy birthday.
[344:18.73]Thanks, John, for introducing you.
[344:21.87]E3 streams are always fun.
[344:24.25]Although we're not going to get an E3 this year.
[344:25.81]At least it's being postponed or pushed or something maybe or even canceled altogether.
[344:29.75]I don't know.
[344:32.25]When is E3 typically?
[344:36.20]It's just canceled altogether?
[344:41.22]I wasn't being sarcastic when I said I'm sorry things are so bad.
[344:43.84]I know, but even if you were or weren't, it's still funny to me.
[344:49.19]It makes me laugh.
[344:54.00]It's like just humorous because I was sitting, I'm like complaining about like the Hulk missiles and it's like, dude, sorry things are so bad.
[344:59.86]Like the Hulk missiles are hitting you.
[345:03.50]Like, alright.
[345:06.25]It's humor there.
[345:11.01]It's just, even if I, even if it wasn't being sarcastic, it's still, it was a fun comment.
[345:18.19]I appreciate it though.
[345:19.12]I really do.
[345:19.76]Thank you.
[345:22.73]He thinks care and sincerity are humorous.
[345:25.23]No, like, the current, like, situation for when that comment came through, I was, like, I was, like, talking shit about, like, Qbert or something.
[345:32.77]I don't know, whatever it was.
[345:35.26]I think you're just a psycho.
[345:37.40]Eh, maybe.
[345:39.19]Maybe one day we'll take that test.
[345:40.73]Maybe one day I'll do, like, psychoanalyze me thing.
[345:46.13]Where I get somebody that would be comfortable being on screen.
[345:48.54]And we do, like, a full, like, do, like, a personality analyzation.
[345:52.78]Funny.
[345:58.14]Hey, Espada Escalada, thanks for the 250.
[345:59.85]The air conditioner in the Brave Little Toaster scared the hell out of me when I was a small kid.
[346:03.47]Yeah.
[346:03.61]Yeah.
[346:05.11]Uh, I'll one-up you on that one.
[346:06.75]Um, the clown.
[346:08.45]The clown was the scariest thing in that entire movie.
[346:16.61]Yeah.
[346:18.51]Run!
[346:21.24]Farfine.
[346:23.28]The music in that movie is awesome, too.
[346:27.24]I took a man to a graveyard.
[346:29.78]All of the sweat and it burned and it rained.
[346:31.88]Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[346:34.86]Worthless.
[346:35.91]That movie's so good.
[346:37.89]Oh my god, it's so good.
[346:39.75]Just please go watch it.
[346:40.93]Just delete the stream.
[346:42.55]Just delete your... Just check that X and go watch it right now.
[346:46.47]However you get it.
[346:51.78]It's so good.
[346:53.50]Why is it not on my top 10 list of movies ever made?
[346:56.56]It is now.
[346:58.97]Hey, Kerbumble, thanks for the five dollars.
[347:01.22]It's great to see you finally play this.
[347:03.16]Other than Gotcha Force, this has been what I've been looking forward to the most.
[347:06.70]By the way, you can put things down with the D-pad.
[347:08.46]Thank you so much.
[347:09.86]There's a special funny animation for people.
[347:13.48]Good to know.
[347:14.73]Dwarverine.
[347:15.73]Classic name there.
[347:16.95]Hey, bub.
[347:18.27]This Hulk guy seems pretty tough, but he's no match for me.
[347:20.85]Dwarverine.
[347:21.53]The Wolverine door.
[347:22.59]Well, thanks for the ten dollars, Wolverine door.
[347:28.48]Thank you.
[347:32.33]NV11Casting, thanks for the $2.50.
[347:35.59]Ignore the haters, King.
[347:36.75]Your item shelf is fun and cool.
[347:39.81]Yeah, I know.
[347:40.29]I wouldn't have done it if I didn't think so.
[347:41.81]Shido's up there.
[347:42.89]I can't believe you guys are talking shit about Shido.
[347:44.63]He's right in the middle.
[347:48.07]Vilemi, thanks for the $25.
[347:49.05]Jeremy, you gotta give us a tour of your anime figurine collection.
[347:58.78]Thanks for the $25.
[347:59.22]Hey, DarkSoul, thanks for the $250.
[348:05.09]I have to take back making fun of your Reddit chamber.
[348:07.87]I got a Stormwind City SteamVR home map on my index and fucking pogged.
[348:14.66]It has the music and everything.
[348:15.78]I'm just as much of a child.
[348:19.00]Well, that just sounds really, really great.
[348:27.76]I want that.
[348:29.50]That's so cool.
[348:30.18]You can walk around Stormwind.
[348:31.50]That's so awesome.
[348:34.44]And then Dark Soul again, thanks for the $2.50.
[348:36.80]Any Funkers in chat during my walk?
[348:40.36]Judging by the extreme backlash of having four on the shelf, I don't think there are very many.
[348:47.62]I'm on the wrong screen.
[348:51.05]This is just Hulk.
[348:53.69]No music or anything.
[348:54.59]Yeah, it's been a while.
[348:55.35]Sorry about that.
[348:59.79]We confused a lot of people that thought the game was still going on.
[349:05.94]Sorry about that.
[349:08.18]Hey, Peep Kush McGee, thanks for the three dollars.
[349:11.80]Thanks for the genuine laughs, Jerma.
[349:13.00]I've been a fan for a couple years and rediscovered you through a friend and Jerma 2.
[349:18.80]Keep doing what you do.
[349:20.57]Thank you.
[349:23.08]Thanks for the rediscovery.
[349:24.48]Hope you're still having fun.
[349:27.75]C4G, thanks for the $2.50.
[349:29.15]Jerma, stop.
[349:29.81]Please don't melt my Funko Pop, dude.
[349:31.47]Come on, I'm still making payments on it.
[349:33.55]I had to remortgage my house.
[349:34.96]Please, dude, just let go of my Diamond Peter Griffin Comic Con exclusive Funko Pop.
[349:39.12]Come on.
[349:50.92]That's fucking funny.
[349:51.98]Thank you, uh, Gleg Dali for the three dollars.
[349:56.22]Heard you loved No More Heroes.
[349:57.54]I do.
[349:58.38]You ever heard or played a Killer7?
[349:59.56]Suda51's other most well-known game.
[350:02.52]Yes, I have.
[350:04.22]I need to beat No More Heroes 2 before I consider playing Killer7.
[350:07.06]By the way, we need to do that soon.
[350:08.30]It's such a good game.
[350:11.36]I'm not putting it off for any particular reason.
[350:13.66]I love the whole series.
[350:15.74]And I have to play the one that came out on PC.
[350:18.89]I want to play them all.
[350:24.66]Travis Strikes Again.
[350:25.38]Yeah, that's the one I'm talking about.
[350:26.22]The one from PC.
[350:32.96]Yeah, we'll cross that bridge after the other No More Heroes series.
[350:39.36]Thanks a lot.
[350:40.35]Goiki, thanks for $5.
[350:41.39]One of these days, you should just actually listen to one of the guys.
[350:44.05]One guy who said to play some random game.
[350:46.43]Turn off the current game and switch it and see how chat reacts.
[350:48.59]I did that with Rain World.
[350:52.81]You are describing the exact scenario of Rain World.
[350:55.29]It wasn't.
[350:59.91]It was Rain.
[351:01.37]No.
[351:01.49]Rain World was like more than 10 people.
[351:05.05]But I did just stop what I was doing in open Rain World.
[351:13.74]But.
[351:16.62]Yeah.
[351:16.72]Yeah.
[351:18.79]I mean, here's another scenario that's funnier than that.
[351:22.89]I mean, like, we're talking comedy levels.
[351:25.47]The thing I'm gonna say is just funnier than what you said.
[351:29.53]But, no.
[351:30.59]It'd be funny if I had a plant in the chat that said, like, oh, dude, like, were you just fucking next already?
[351:38.60]And, like, beat the fifth boss of Dark Souls 2 with unarmed?
[351:45.34]And I'm just like, oh...
[351:46.18]Fucking, oh yeah, let me just do this real quick.
[351:47.99]And I have it queued up already and I turn it off and I go right to it and I do it.
[351:52.53]And I've like practiced that boss like fucking a hundred times to make sure I can do it.
[351:55.38]I already did that joke, did I?
[352:00.36]Maybe I did.
[352:05.50]I don't know what your guys' deal is with people that like stuff.
[352:08.52]Oh no, R Funko.
[352:09.40]They like that shit, and it's fine.
[352:11.10]It's fun, it's collectibles, who cares?
[352:35.85]Like, people owning Funko Pops are not going to give you hemorrhoids.
[352:41.27]It's like, don't worry about it.
[352:51.96]A beast of plastic.
[352:53.30]What?
[352:55.10]He's so defensive over his Funkos.
[353:00.98]He's a moderator.
[353:02.50]No, I'm not.
[353:03.26]And relax.
[353:04.76]Relax.
[353:05.39]Relax.
[353:06.33]Relax.
[353:07.63]Relax.
[353:09.43]What is a piece of plastic?
[353:11.25]I don't understand.
[353:16.41]Okay, if you're gonna say it's just a piece of plastic, I would love to see your Team Fortress 2 hat collection.
[353:24.86]How much do you spend on those?
[353:32.13]A lot of those were hundreds and hundreds of dollars.
[353:41.48]I feel attacked.
[353:46.47]How many did you have?
[353:47.39]I had quite a few.
[353:49.97]Not really, though.
[353:50.73]I never really had a lot of unusuals.
[353:53.23]Or any expensive hats.
[353:56.43]What did I... I had one unusual for the Demoman.
[353:59.82]What was it?
[354:05.37]Gibbous friend.
[354:06.23]Feels good, man.
[354:07.07]I used to love if there was especially a heavy gibbous.
[354:11.18]That was the best.
[354:13.60]It was the most adorable thing ever, because you just knew everything about that person's entire life.
[354:19.14]You know what I mean?
[354:20.06]Like, if I saw a gibbous heavy, I knew everything about them.
[354:23.98]And I loved them.
[354:33.51]That was the best thing.
[354:34.55]The Gibbous is one of the greatest additions to any game.
[354:44.34]You made multiple unboxing videos.
[354:45.88]You're guilty on both ends.
[354:46.88]I made like three.
[354:48.70]And this is like two... Okay, I made like three unboxing videos in like 2012.
[354:53.50]And after the third one, I was like, oh, this is kind of dumb.
[354:56.87]I don't want to do that ever again.
[354:58.67]And I didn't.
[354:59.49]And I haven't.
[355:07.88]Three is multiple.
[355:09.88]Yeah but I- I made three unboxing videos because I don't know. They were popular. People thought they were cool.
[355:15.88]I'm like: Oh, should I do these? People like these. People want to see this. I guess I'll try it.
[355:21.88]I did it a couple times and it was like: Oh, okay. This is okay I guess.
[355:23.88]And then after the third one is just like: I don't really want to do that. I don't want to do- I want to do something else, I don't want to do that anymore.
[355:29.00]It was pop- yeah I tried it. You know obviously there's like something interesting people think it's cool you'll want to try it.
[355:46.70]We need another gate queue.
[355:49.16]Alright, let's finish up here.
[355:50.98]We still have like another probably five minutes or so.
[355:55.05]Mr. Sneakman, thanks for the $2.50.
[355:56.43]I have a sneaky question.
[355:57.85]What's your favorite sneaker?
[355:58.93]Stay safe.
[356:01.01]I like my favorite sneaker.
[356:04.21]Nike Prestos.
[356:06.00]That's the best thing I've ever worn in my life.
[356:08.00]I'm talking Nike Prestos from like 1998.
[356:09.44]There you go.
[356:13.74]Autumn Dragons, thanks for the $2.50.
[356:16.32]Good evening, King.
[356:17.10]I adore the mullet hair you have going on.
[356:19.87]Also, do you not realize that Funko Pops are objectively ugly?
[356:24.09]Here we go again.
[356:27.93]But it's me who is talking about the Funko Pops.
[356:33.40]No, I am just addressing and reacting to the constant slander and attacks that I've had to see over the course of this five and six hour stream.
[356:46.53]Anyways, why would you look at a Funko Pop and think, wow, I want to own this?
[356:50.49]Anyways, thanks for the cool stream, Dad.
[356:51.97]Hope everything's settling in the new home alright.
[356:53.91]I don't know.
[356:59.91]Why do people collect... Why do people collect anything?
[357:02.93]Why do people collect stamps?
[357:06.17]It's just something.
[357:06.97]I mean, it's just a piece of paper.
[357:08.55]And it has, like, Elvis on it.
[357:15.68]Those are cooler.
[357:16.66]Those are valuable.
[357:19.28]Valuable.
[357:20.68]Dumbo is $6,500.
[357:22.64]Okay, I don't even know why I'm defending Funko Pop so much.
[357:30.10]Because I don't even care.
[357:31.72]Like, up until today, this stream, I did not even give a shit about any of these.
[357:38.80]I thought they were cute and they were interesting.
[357:42.56]I got them two or three years ago.
[357:45.13]I'm not some Funko Pop aficionado that cares this much, but yet I'm still here defending.
[357:53.53]And I will continue to.
[357:58.11]I was going to add a motherfucker on the end of that, but I refrained from it.
[358:01.27]We're making progress.
[358:05.05]But yeah, we're settling really well.
[358:09.21]Anytime you move, it takes a long time before you actually... This is just where I live, right?
[358:15.39]Takes a little while.
[358:16.82]No, it's been going good.
[358:20.48]Slowly but surely, right?
[358:23.32]Kale... Kale... Kale the chain... Kale to... I can't read.
[358:33.02]Kale to Changa... Kale to Changa boy.
[358:37.26]I hope I'm saying that right.
[358:41.69]I get to drive the car today because it's my birthday.
[358:43.52]It's not much, but it's my birthday.
[358:45.22]Well, thanks for the $5 and giving me $5 on your birthday.
[358:53.00]It's my birthday.
[358:53.86]Wish to give a little something to one of my favorite people ever.
[358:56.10]Have a good night.
[358:56.75]Thank you so much, Kale.
[359:00.53]That's an incredibly nice thing to say.
[359:02.17]Hope you had a good birthday.
[359:03.55]Happy birthday.
[359:06.23]Give him $10 back.
[359:11.67]Thank you overthink for the $15.
[359:13.37]Jeremy, please tell Otto I love him.
[359:16.02]Otto!
[359:17.36]I guess you're not too bad either.
[359:19.06]Thank you for just being you.
[359:21.38]That's the only person I know how to be.
[359:22.54]I don't know how to be anybody else.
[359:25.86]I don't plan on trying to be anybody else but me.
[359:28.93]That's who I am.
[359:31.27]Thanks for the $15.
[359:35.63]Oh my god damn it.
[359:39.25]I've even moved places and that's still happening.
[359:45.99]Why is this happening more frequently?
[359:47.85]This shit didn't happen this often.
[359:50.34]More like a week or two ago.
[359:51.40]What's going on?
[359:51.98]Am I getting more like animated with my hands?
[359:56.56]It must be like an extra animation here with my hands.
[359:59.08]I don't understand.
[360:01.67]The mic is in the same spot.
[360:05.00]Ocean Dweller, thanks for the 250.
[360:06.16]I'm embarrassed for you seeing those Funko Pops.
[360:08.27]Please use this money to throw them out.
[360:09.55]Okay.
[360:12.79]BoxBox came in with 2,000 people in a raid.
[360:16.73]Thanks, BoxBox, for the huge raid.
[360:19.17]Really appreciate it.
[360:22.12]If those of you that still hear from that, thanks for sticking around.
[360:27.96]Hope you enjoyed what you saw.
[360:28.96]And if you didn't, I'm sure you'll tell me all about it on Reddit.
[360:32.72]My favorite website.
[360:37.03]Swiggity-swanky, thanks for the $2.50.
[360:39.36]Nice pajamas, by the way.
[360:40.68]It's a Captain Marvel t-shirt.
[360:43.92]This is like a business casual shirt.
[360:46.79]But let me, thanks for the $5.00.
[360:47.95]Jerma, I demand that you cover that shelf in high-quality anime figurines.
[360:51.19]I will never do that.
[360:53.56]Not gonna happen.
[360:56.28]Thank you.
[360:57.52]Uh, thank you Lesbian Bigfoot for the 1500 bits.
[361:02.09]$15.
[361:02.25]Absolutely lost it at the Funko Pop reveal.
[361:04.79]Be proud of your non-Reddit collection, Jeremy.
[361:08.39]Also, I missed the beginning of the stream.
[361:09.83]Hope Otto's doing okay.
[361:11.57]Thanks for the great content.
[361:13.64]Yeah, he's doing better.
[361:14.38]He has one or two more days left on the antibiotics.
[361:18.56]So...
[361:23.23]The idea is he's getting better and after the next few days when they're all gone, hopefully he's back to normal.
[361:29.25]He is going to go back in for an evaluation.
[361:33.53]Just to make sure he's 100% fine.
[361:36.27]Because if there's a case where this comes back after the antibiotics, then there's something else that has to be done here and we got to figure out what's going on.
[361:46.71]But we hope it doesn't really get anything too serious.
[361:51.37]As it stands right now, he's doing just fine.
[361:53.03]So, thank you.
[361:55.77]Couscous, thanks for the 252 things.
[361:57.43]Love the collared shirt.
[361:59.41]Professional as fuck.
[362:01.65]And two, I'm glad Otto is doing better.
[362:03.35]I'm thinking about getting a dog.
[362:04.53]Any tips for first-time dog owners?
[362:07.82]Um, yes.
[362:09.56]Rescue.
[362:13.48]Rescuing a dog, um, is an amazing experience.
[362:19.20]Because...
[362:21.01]A lot of times they'll be already a couple years old.
[362:23.91]They might already be used to people.
[362:26.89]They might already be house trained.
[362:34.67]and you get to take a dog whose life may have been turned completely upside down because the thing about rescues is sometimes rescues are dogs or cats or animals whatever bunny rabbits doesn't matter who just kind of with circumstances got placed in a bad spot
[362:55.83]For instance, if somebody's owner passes away.
[362:59.15]I remember when I was doing stuff at the animal shelter.
[363:04.76]If you don't remember, some of you guys weren't here.
[363:09.00]Three or four years ago, maybe a little bit longer than that, whatever it was.
[363:12.49]I volunteered at the animal shelter for like a year or so.
[363:16.29]and animals would come in, that was just perfectly normal.
[363:19.99]There was nothing wrong with them, they weren't doing anything bad.
[363:22.18]They were just brought in, and one of them was because their owner had died.
[363:28.40]And they were like four years old, but it was just a great, normal, just loving dog that is now displaced completely in a fucking animal shelter.
[363:37.93]And it's just like completely different than anything they've ever experienced in their whole life.
[363:40.99]And it was just heartbreaking to know that like, wow, you spent like five years living a potentially normal life in somebody's house, and then all of a sudden now you're in an animal shelter.
[363:52.57]It can be a lot.
[363:56.53]So...
[363:58.85]You get to kind of come in and the cycle, the circle gets to complete, you know?
[364:04.33]Get to help out when you can and get a dog or a cat that's sort of already got some stuff going on.
[364:12.91]I would recommend that you rescue your dog.
[364:17.59]I got my dog from a rescue eight years ago and he's so sweet.
[364:20.01]Yeah, that's Otto.
[364:22.63]Otto was a rescue.
[364:26.62]Otto is like the best dog I've ever fucking come across.
[364:30.48]I love this dog.
[364:31.93]He is like the best dog in so many ways.
[364:36.91]He was a rescue.
[364:37.83]He was like two or three years old when I got him.
[364:43.11]If that's any anecdotal evidence of how a rescue can be, there he is.
[364:54.12]Yeah.
[364:54.96]Hopefully that helps.
[365:05.08]Thanks for the $2.50.
[365:06.66]Good luck on your dog adventure.
[365:10.38]We also had some subs, and by the way, we're going to do the credits here.
[365:14.40]We had five from JermaSucks, five from TippedOver, and five we caught already from LoserByBeck.
[365:19.66]I think we caught TippedOver as well, but thanks for the 15 subs in a row there, guys, all three of you.
[365:25.63]And that will bring us to the point of this stream where we roll the credits.
[365:33.57]Very well, bumping you in the face.
[365:37.23]Thank you all of you for your subscriptions.
[365:42.81]I told you.
[365:43.71]I told you.
[365:44.13]There's just like fucking hundreds of them.
[365:48.47]It's crazy.
[365:50.77]I come back from not streaming for like five days and it's just like boom.
[365:59.04]You guys are too good to me.
[366:02.66]Thank you.
[366:03.06]All of you.
[366:03.36]Appreciate it.
[366:06.82]And let's finish the bits.
[366:10.62]Goiki, thanks for $5.
[366:11.76]Question because I'm kind of torn on it myself.
[366:14.11]Who wins in terms of video games alone?
[366:15.79]DC or Marvel?
[366:19.25]Just in terms of video games.
[366:20.41]Only video games?
[366:23.03]I mean, how much weight do the Arkham Batman games carry?
[366:29.70]Because it's probably DC.
[366:33.97]The Spider-Man PS4 game was awesome.
[366:40.47]Maybe one of the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games.
[366:43.59]Maybe like the Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.
[366:47.55]I don't think they can be held up to like Arkham City or Arkham Asylum.
[366:52.40]It's probably DC.
[366:59.52]Yeah.
[367:00.94]DC probably has better games in quotes.
[367:04.82]Why did another $50 come in?
[367:06.62]5,000 fucking... 5,000.
[367:08.27]That's another $50.
[367:12.69]Jerma, today is my one-year sub-anniversary.
[367:15.53]I want to do something big to celebrate and thank you for all the laughs that you've given me this past year.
[367:19.96]These dreams have helped me through so much and have made me laugh when I thought I couldn't anymore.
[367:24.10]And led me to meet the most important person in my life.
[367:27.50]My boyfriend, Friedl Schlitz.
[367:31.18]Without you, we wouldn't have, we would have never met.
[367:33.48]Thanks so much for everything.
[367:36.86]That just makes me feel so fucking happy.
[367:41.82]That's so, that's so nice.
[367:45.42]I can't, like, that's, I don't even know what to say.
[367:48.78]That's unbelievable.
[367:50.88]Thank you so much for the $50 for sticking around, both of you.
[367:56.01]I can't believe people have met and had created long-lasting friendships and relationships through this channel.
[368:03.26]It's mind-boggling to me.
[368:07.86]Thank you so much for the $50.
[368:08.68]This janitor sucks at his job.
[368:14.61]Does he suck at his job, or do you guys just keep throwing shit on the floor?
[368:19.03]Like, right there.
[368:20.60]Maybe if you stopped throwing things, the janitor wouldn't have to come out and clean every single second.
[368:24.64]And maybe if they wouldn't have so many rats in here... Thanks a lot.
[368:33.14]Hey, Havgon, thanks for the 250!
[368:34.12]Yeah, you guys didn't know?
[368:35.60]Tomorrow.
[368:35.80]Literally, that's happening on Sunday.
[368:36.96]I mean, playing Hulk tomorrow, then playing Morrowind multiplayer with Joel on Sunday.
[369:00.99]I probably shouldn't do that.
[369:02.09]That's like, that's probably, that's not cool.
[369:04.43]That's not cool.
[369:05.05]You can't, like, you can't do that.
[369:06.13]That's not cool.
[369:07.80]That's just not even cool.
[369:09.14]Um, so, uh, that was a funny joke that I just did.
[369:14.48]I acted like that was just so not cool.
[369:16.78]Uh, I'm just gonna pretend like I didn't say that.
[369:22.62]Hey, Catboy!
[369:23.88]Thanks for the 250.
[369:24.68]Hi, King.
[369:26.10]Being another person with ADHD, it's super great to see someone else face the same struggles and shit.
[369:31.53]Not to be epic cringe, but as someone raised with a not-so-great parental relationship, super nice to have someone like you be able to look up to, Dad.
[369:40.31]As I go, I must say thank you for the kitty floss.
[369:45.26]With a three face.
[369:46.32]And play Super Paper Mario.
[369:49.61]I also have Funko Pops I bought years ago.
[369:51.55]I regret if you want to buy them off of me.
[369:53.49]Should never even show.
[369:58.27]Whatever.
[369:58.91]We talked about Roger Rabbit a week ago.
[370:01.11]That's why I figured I'd show it to you.
[370:03.94]Whatever.
[370:04.30]I'll be laughing my way all the way to the bank in 10 years when I sell that Roger Rabbit for 10 grand.
[370:14.36]Or $2 when that market is worthless.
[370:18.92]I'll still make some money.
[370:24.96]Thanks for the $2.50.
[370:29.15]And yeah, I have ADHD as well.
[370:33.99]It can be annoying.
[370:35.87]But you know what?
[370:36.57]I just try to deal with it.
[370:38.63]Just try to do it.
[370:40.41]Turn the walk.
[370:43.99]Aren't Beanie Babies the worst Bitcoins?
[370:47.74]Guys, something... Alright, I'm going to tell you something about Bitcoin.
[370:51.92]Bitcoin, Bitcoin.
[370:54.86]Bitcoin is still like $7,000.
[370:58.95]For one.
[371:03.49]I mean, they're not worth like 30 cents.
[371:15.00]Beanie coin.
[371:17.40]Here we go again.
[371:18.18]A crypto rant.
[371:19.00]No, my dad did.
[371:19.52]It was a crypto sentence.
[371:23.85]Hey, Heron Flow.
[371:25.11]Thanks for the $5.
[371:25.51]Hey, Jerma.
[371:26.41]My name is Chase.
[371:27.09]I've been watching you since I was 11.
[371:30.71]Making me feel old.
[371:31.85]You're making me feel old.
[371:32.61]It's been like 10 fucking years.
[371:35.06]I'm now a freshman in college.
[371:37.18]You've been a role model for me for how I act and treat others for about half of my life.
[371:41.96]I truly cannot thank you enough for the joy you brought me and for truly saving my life a year ago.
[371:45.53]Impression is a bitch.
[371:48.03]Regardless, you're an amazing person and thank you for being you.
[371:51.25]You don't realize the extent that you reach out and touch people.
[371:58.09]Thank you for the five dollars first of all and second of all I sometimes I forget That some of you guys have been watching since you were kids Like teenagers and now you're you're fucking fully grown adults Some of you were fully grown adults before and now you're super fully grown adults like me
[372:22.52]10 years is a long time.
[372:24.36]I can't believe there are some people that have been watching for that long.
[372:27.56]That still are here.
[372:28.64]That still like this channel.
[372:35.59]Thanks for watching for that long.
[372:38.43]A long fucking time.
[372:43.77]Gen Z Boomers.
[372:47.71]Another $50.
[372:48.29]This is another money stream.
[372:51.31]Thanks for the 5,000 bits tipped over.
[372:53.93]$50.
[372:55.57]Love your stuff, man.
[372:56.55]And hey, if you want, you can use this to get a U2s of yourself.
[372:59.35]Is that how much they cost?
[373:04.77]A U2s is $50?
[373:08.35]Can I make it like $8?
[373:27.42]But would I be the dickhead that has the U2s that's like 75% cheaper than every other one on the website?
[373:35.21]I couldn't even do that.
[373:37.31]I probably wouldn't even let me do that.
[373:44.53]Just do it and get a bunch on your shelf.
[373:46.73]It's just not a scenario where, hey, just go do it.
[373:49.32]I don't think they have to want to do that.
[373:54.60]That's not like my decision to make.
[374:00.08]You know, I don't just like call up U2s and go, hey, I want one of me.
[374:03.72]Okay, see you next week when it's done.
[374:09.49]Do one for Fireman?
[374:10.37]That'd be kind of cool, but I don't know.
[374:12.29]We'll see.
[374:13.15]We'll see if the Funko Pop meme continues to have legs.
[374:16.61]I'll think about it.
[374:18.37]Stripes Beast, thanks for 250.
[374:19.87]Jerma, the average height in 1800 was 5'6".
[374:22.22]Cool.
[374:22.86]You see, when the chips are down, these tall people, they'll lead each other.
[374:27.88]See, you aren't short.
[374:28.68]You're just ahead of the curve.
[374:32.44]Thank you.
[374:34.88]Tipped over again.
[374:35.62]$3.
[374:36.46]Get a U2.
[374:37.58]I don't... I'm not going to explore that for at least a long time.
[374:42.48]Pixelated cabbage.
[374:43.50]$2.50.
[374:43.86]Thank you.
[374:44.24]Is that a Minecraft chest on the shelf?
[374:47.24]If so, please.
[374:48.81]If so... Wait.
[374:50.17]If... If so, please sew it.
[374:53.23]Love the new setup.
[374:54.13]Please sew it.
[374:54.81]Please show it.
[374:56.95]Oh, that is The Binding of Isaac card game.
[375:01.85]I haven't played it one time.
[375:04.09]Cool to look at.
[375:07.28]Ankypixelated Cabbage.
[375:08.28]It is not Minecraft.
[375:09.36]It is The Binding of Isaac card game.
[375:11.24]Board game thing.
[375:13.12]Not even close.
[375:13.56]Uh...
[375:42.05]millions of dollars.
[375:43.11]That was pretty comprehensive.
[375:46.17]He's a confirmed millionaire.
[375:53.42]Confirmed millionaire.
[375:56.94]There's a lot of oxymorons in this sentence.
[375:58.88]Maybe.
[375:59.40]Maybe.
[376:01.65]But thank you.
[376:02.15]Thank you for just one amongst the millions of dollars.
[376:09.56]You do realize that if a thousand of you give 250 bits, you can do that math.
[376:21.21]You know what I'm saying?
[376:23.19]It's a lot.
[376:26.01]Don't ever think that you're not giving that much money.
[376:33.91]A lot of you giving a dollar adds up to a shitload of money.
[376:38.94]So it's not... Don't ever think that, oh fuck, I'm only giving him like a dollar.
[376:45.58]Don't ever feel fucking bad about that.
[376:47.14]And don't ever think that you should be doing it in the first place.
[376:53.92]Because even giving one dollar to the stream, you are part of contributing to this to me.
[377:01.52]And sometimes I can't fucking believe it.
[377:07.84]He's trying to get us to donate.
[377:09.69]Well, stream's pretty much over.
[377:11.59]So, no, it's not.
[377:12.19]Whoa, we got a lot of bits tonight.
[377:13.79]Speaking of money.
[377:16.53]Don't ever feel obligated to give me money.
[377:18.45]And when you give me money, don't ever feel like it's not enough money.
[377:22.55]Don't.
[377:23.07]Please don't feel that way.
[377:26.13]Judging by my last comment about statistics and evidence and math.
[377:36.59]Thank you.
[377:39.33]Thank you to 1-1-1-2-E for the three dollars.
[377:44.70]Thanks a lot with the PogChamp.
[377:49.62]Me too.
[377:50.26]Slimer's got hot dogs in his mouth.
[377:51.80]It's pretty cool.
[377:54.44]Hey, Drysis7thegreat.
[377:57.42]Thanks for the five dollars.
[377:59.40]Thanks for being a constant source of entertainment since back in your TF2 days.
[378:02.54]Even though you collect Funko Pops, I still respect you.
[378:05.22]I don't collect Funko Pops.
[378:06.36]I just have a few of them.
[378:08.20]Tim has a few of them.
[378:09.78]And together that makes six.
[378:11.46]Times that by two, we have twelve of them.
[378:13.54]Total.
[378:15.68]We just have a few.
[378:16.67]We don't have that many.
[378:17.33]We have a few of them.
[378:19.17]We haven't bought any in about three and a half years.
[378:23.75]Just because I display them today does not mean I bought them today.
[378:28.11]See?
[378:28.19]I am a good person.
[378:28.59]Thank you for the $2.50.
[378:29.32]I see.
[378:29.62]You've said it yourself.
[378:59.60]Thanks for the $2.50, Dubskeed.
[379:03.32]Raddus Raccoon, thanks for $2.50.
[379:04.90]Jeremy, you truly do have a fake gamer room.
[379:06.96]I love it.
[379:07.55]Here's to help fund your Funko Pop collection.
[379:10.67]I got a fake gamer room.
[379:15.61]It's a shelf with some lights on it.
[379:18.94]And like some old PC games.
[379:30.95]No, that Funko Pop with the clown and the bald head is not even accurate.
[379:36.03]10 community subs from TippedOver, thank you.
[379:39.90]Evan Gelion, thanks for the thousand bits, 10 bucks.
[379:43.34]Hey man, love the stream.
[379:44.16]Speaking of one guy, I think it'd be a cool idea for a stream if you just played a bunch of shitty games and if a large enough percentage of chat votes next, you actually go to the next game.
[379:54.05]The ultimate culmination of that meme anyway, just a thought.
[379:56.97]Hope auto as well.
[379:57.85]Here's a pog coin, King.
[379:59.65]Thank you.
[380:00.89]Unfortunately, you are describing every stream that ever happened when I had the next emote activated.
[380:10.22]That was just every stream.
[380:13.66]So, I don't know if I want to go back to that.
[380:16.09]That was, uh, maybe we buried that one.
[380:29.19]Evan... Yeah, guys, it's Evan Gelion.
[380:34.52]E-V-A-N J-E-L-L-Y-E-O-N
[380:40.71]Evangelion.
[380:41.65]I'm saying it correctly.
[380:45.73]That's their name.
[380:47.99]You just gotta do you.
[380:48.69]You gotta do you the way you know how, because only you know how to do it.
[380:51.14]And I'll keep saying that over and over again until the day I die.
[381:11.21]Be the worst you can be.
[381:12.31]Well, no.
[381:13.33]That would be the psycho way to say it.
[381:14.97]Put your pedal to the metal.
[381:26.08]Koos Koos, thanks for the $2.50.
[381:27.28]My dog will be a rescue.
[381:28.68]I'm between two.
[381:30.70]Let you know what I decide next week.
[381:32.26]Good luck.
[381:34.29]I'm sure you make the right choice.
[381:35.53]Any choice is the right choice.
[381:38.13]You're the great dogs.
[381:40.30]Uh, that's way harder than it looks.
[381:41.42]Um...
[382:07.43]Like we're talking like a 20 to 30, 40 plus person marching band.
[382:11.75]It was going to be on that stream.
[382:14.43]That was the only way I would have allowed that stream to happen.
[382:17.98]It had to be a thing that had to be on that stream or I was not going to do it.
[382:22.74]I don't care how funny I thought the other shit could have been.
[382:25.20]No.
[382:27.00]Without the marching band walking through that stream, I refuse to do it.
[382:36.68]I was ready and willing to pay the money and put up and have it all happen, but it's hard to hire an entire marching band.
[382:51.09]I wanted them in full costume with like the trumpets in there.
[382:55.91]I wanted them in the hats and shit.
[383:07.08]it's still possible just find a marching band and I gotta want to do it you're gonna do it if you're gonna be in your house see but yeah I mean that's like you don't think that's funny to have like 30 people fucking walk through on webcam playing and like blasting marching band music for my asmr stream
[383:38.86]Otto would freak out.
[383:39.74]Otto wouldn't be here.
[383:43.54]I would make sure Otto was out and taking a walk or Kim would take him somewhere or something.
[383:48.88]He wouldn't be here.
[383:52.63]What about the neighbors?
[383:56.31]I would have to like... I would have to give probably a couple knocks on some of the doors and just be like, um, can I ask you something?
[384:07.49]Do you like marching bands?
[384:10.35]You do?
[384:11.46]You do?
[384:12.08]That's good to hear.
[384:13.06]It's very good to hear.
[384:14.72]How does a free concert sound?
[384:18.92]Tomorrow.
[384:21.02]At 7 o'clock Pacific.
[384:29.85]No.
[384:31.89]Well, no, the idea was if I would do it at the studio in Vegas.
[384:38.79]That same studio I've been to a few times.
[384:41.65]I would do it there.
[384:43.23]And that doesn't matter.
[384:45.49]It's a fucking TV studio.
[384:56.21]That's for another time.
[384:58.05]For another day.
[385:00.89]WhyMog gave 25 community subs.
[385:03.27]25 subs.
[385:07.73]Thank you for the insane sub drop.
[385:09.65]That was only a few minutes ago.
[385:13.41]Thanks for the 25 sub, Wymog.
[385:18.37]Bonderlane, thanks for another 250.
[385:19.82]By the way, it is absolutely unbelievable that a Pac-Man fan such as yourself, he owns a Ralph Plush Pog, has never played the best Pac-Man game, Pac-Man World 2.
[385:30.76]It's a collect-a-thon platformer, very similar to Banjo-Kazooie.
[385:34.16]Please play it.
[385:38.00]Um, yeah, whatever, I'll play it.
[385:42.07]Probably done for a while, but yeah, put it on the list.
[385:45.11]Trogbum, thanks for $5.
[385:46.47]Thanks for being such a great streamer.
[385:47.53]I've also watched you since I was 13.
[385:48.65]See, that's what I'm saying.
[385:50.89]Long time.
[385:51.48]Enjoyed stopping by and seeing all the hilarious stuff you put out.
[385:53.64]Thanks for being around and being so creative.
[385:57.18]Thanks for watching and thinking that this is any good.
[386:00.28]Sometimes it surprises me still to this day.
[386:04.64]Thanks for the five bucks.
[386:06.36]Jerma lied about Morrowind multiplayer.
[386:08.92]Thanks for the 250.
[386:09.76]Yeah, that one might last a while.
[386:14.28]Thanks for the 250.
[386:15.78]Also to Guillotine Senpai.
[386:19.16]As possibly the richest clown on Earth, have you thought about creating an organization to support underprivileged clowns?
[386:26.39]Like Dr. Phil.
[386:30.54]you want me to be like Dr. phil and like bring clowns on here or you are you saying that Dr. phil is a Dr. clown whatever doctor you're saying that Dr. phil is an underprivileged clown the latter okay I had clowns on stream before they were great
[386:54.94]But, I don't know.
[386:55.38]We'll see.
[386:55.92]Thank you, Cloers V for the 250.
[386:58.77]Jerma, my king, why haven't you enabled Bernie Pog?
[387:01.39]We're waiting.
[387:04.27]I'm not going to enable somebody's face that's not my face.
[387:07.31]Am I going to take somebody's face and charge for you to put their face in this stream when it's not my face?
[387:14.76]I ain't going to do that.
[387:21.64]And then finally, to wrap us up here and end us, I'll see you guys tomorrow, by the way, for more Hulk Ultimate Destruction.
[387:31.89]Probably around the same time, around 4 o'clock or so Pacific.
[387:35.25]A goo berry juice with 250 guten tag, Hairderma.
[387:39.27]Listen, don't worry about your weird Hulk poop fetish and Funko addiction.
[387:43.43]It's kinky.
[387:44.93]Ah, glad you're catering to your fans that are into that.
[387:47.32]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[387:48.40]Plus, I mean, you gotta remember, in America, some people want small Sheldon Funko pops with small... Ah, but we need to make sure the stream is big enough for the people that want big Sheldon Funko pops.
[387:59.84]Sure.
[388:00.59]Please, God, I need this.
[388:01.87]Pepe hands.
[388:02.75]Okay.
[388:03.97]Great.
[388:05.15]Thank you for the pop comment.
[388:10.03]Spreo, thanks for 250.
[388:11.31]Another thing, Jerma.
[388:13.05]If you're on jermaMustard website and wondering what the logo on the site is about, just click on it.
[388:20.55]If you aren't, that is alright and forget about it.
[388:23.05]Thanks, man.
[388:23.63]Love you.
[388:26.79]Uh, it's the seagull mascot.
[388:28.72]The seagull is called Savvy.
[388:30.78]He was hatched and created under Karma Komeda's care and saved years later by Sprio.
[388:37.06]They are.
[388:37.98]After being lost in a desert, it is distinguishable by its big heart.
[388:42.93]Savvy the seagull.
[388:46.23]Oh, that's cute.
[388:46.77]I didn't even know that.
[388:47.43]That's cool.
[388:52.62]Stop advertising.
[388:53.64]What?
[388:54.52]This website's great.
[388:58.31]I'll see you tomorrow.
[389:00.99]Be ready to pog tomorrow when I beat the Hulk Ultimate Destruction.
[389:04.75]Or play for an hour and say, I'm done.
[389:06.75]And move on to saw the video game.
[389:09.27]Cool.
[389:11.05]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[389:18.59]Good night.
[389:18.89]Goodbye.
[389:22.41]Zero drop frames.
[389:24.72]I'm happy about this.
[389:27.48]Stream one from Fyber in the books, and it seemed like it was just solid.
[389:33.00]No problems.
[389:34.18]Good, good, good.
[389:37.34]See you tomorrow.
[389:39.62]Blueberry Juice right at the buzzer here, 250.
[389:41.10]Sorry, I'm very drunk.
[389:42.62]Please forgive me, Pepehands.
[389:44.02]Don't worry, you're already forgiven.
[389:44.99]You're always forgiven.
[389:45.81]You're all forgiven.
[389:46.61]All of you.
[389:47.99]Also, I just wanted to mention, since people are saying how they first found you, my friend showed me the Shpee video.
[389:52.57]No joke.
[389:53.93]Happy that you continue to watch after that.
[389:59.53]Thank you, Father.
[390:07.32]Except for you.
[390:08.98]You know who I'm talking about.
[390:10.14]You did shit that was too fucked up to be forgiven.
[390:16.46]You know who you are.
[390:18.38]That's right.
[390:19.32]You.
[390:19.70]Alright.
[390:24.34]See you tomorrow.
[390:26.04]Good night.
[390:26.44]Goodbye.
[390:27.14]Take care.
[390:33.41]That was a Simpsons joke?
[390:34.37]I guess it was.
[390:36.23]Was it?
[390:36.47]I don't know.
[390:38.65]Simpsons has been on the air for like fucking 60 years, guys.
[390:42.01]The Simpsons have said every combination of every word in the dictionary over the last 40 years.
[390:47.70]So of course The Simpsons already said it.
[390:49.38]I know.
[390:49.62]Okay.
[390:50.82]Good night.
