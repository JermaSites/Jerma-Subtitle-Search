[00:04.14]Hey, friend.
[00:05.85]How you doing?
[00:06.13]What's going on?
[00:07.03]I'm just catching my breath.
[00:07.95]I just ran.
[00:11.25]You guys have no idea what it's like behind the scenes.
[00:12.99]There's a lot of running.
[00:15.07]There's a lot of running.
[00:16.72]There's a lot of... My drink is not ready.
[00:20.32]There's not enough ice in it.
[00:22.76]It's crazy behind the scenes here.
[00:25.38]There's not enough ice in my drink.
[00:27.86]Shit's crazy here.
[00:31.61]Anyways, how you doing?
[00:36.12]Jerma, we're always on time.
[00:41.69]Not me.
[00:43.39]Let me make a tweet.
[00:44.01]We'll talk about a bunch of stuff.
[00:45.17]Just give me a minute.
[00:47.69]BRB.
[01:28.66]Okay.
[01:29.14]You guys know what I'm talking about when I say that?
[01:32.32]When you realize that you put ice in your drink and you look over at it and there's three or four little pea-sized ice cubes and it just ruins the rest of your entire day.
[01:47.17]It's like that and then you take a sip out of it and this shit's lukewarm.
[01:49.79]It's not even cold.
[01:51.79]You almost get annoyed that you want to just fish those out because they're not doing anything.
[02:04.32]Just put more.
[02:04.98]I know.
[02:05.32]I'm just fucking around.
[02:08.06]Play Papers, Please.
[02:09.60]I've already played Papers, Please.
[02:14.86]Are you guys like me?
[02:16.17]If you're like me.
[02:18.53]A drink.
[02:22.47]Correct me here if you need to.
[02:24.95]A drink needs to be either very hot or very cold.
[02:32.67]Unless it's water.
[02:36.95]If we're talking about a glass of water, that can be room temp, that's fine.
[02:40.34]Anything else that's not water, that shit better be ice cold or piping hot.
[02:50.70]Yeah, room temperature water is the way that I like to drink water.
[02:57.65]If you're not talking about water, nobody wants to drink a lukewarm fruit punch.
[03:02.76]Nobody wants to drink a barely kind of not really even room temp coffee or tea.
[03:09.15]No.
[03:10.83]Iced coffee?
[03:11.55]Yep.
[03:12.51]Hot coffee?
[03:13.35]Yep.
[03:18.09]Cold fruit punch?
[03:19.26]Yep.
[03:20.24]Hot fruit punch?
[03:22.70]No.
[03:24.66]Lukewarm fruit punch?
[03:25.74]Absolutely not.
[03:28.21]I would rather drink a hot fruit punch than a lukewarm room temperature one.
[03:36.86]Does that make me weird?
[03:44.86]Does it?
[03:52.81]Okay, well, whatever.
[03:54.97]Today, we were going to play...
[04:01.60]We're going to do DreadX today.
[04:03.94]But, like all things on this channel, and all streams you've seen on this channel, last second I pivoted to something else 25 minutes ago.
[04:13.99]And instead of doing that, we're going to do that tomorrow.
[04:21.60]We're going to do something interesting.
[04:25.50]No, I'm not going to play the quarry.
[04:29.33]Guys, so many people have streamed that game that you probably have memorized the entire script.
[04:39.89]I would be in the game, and I would look over here, and you would just be writing dialog as it was happening.
[04:50.80]I didn't play the last one, I don't know.
[04:58.50]I'd rather do DreadX than the quarry.
[05:05.30]I have my ResidentSleepers on standby.
[05:08.82]Well, you better put those away, because what we're actually doing... Mm-hmm.
[05:15.21]There is an event going on on Steam right now.
[05:17.71]It is the Steam Demo Day.
[05:20.43]Week.
[05:22.61]And what that means is there are thousands, I think, or hundreds of demos on Steam...
[05:29.49]And I've got it open here.
[05:31.97]And I'm going to scroll through and we're going to pick a random shit to play.
[05:35.05]And I'm going to give you my real... I'm going to give you my real opinions on a scale of 1 to 5.
[05:42.68]5 being the best.
[05:47.72]1 being decent.
[05:49.60]Kind of decent.
[05:52.10]We're not trying to discourage anybody here, okay?
[06:14.64]one being decent five being great there is no there is no scale why would I even rate them I'm not gonna rate them I just think it's a fun idea we want click maps we want click maps no you're not getting click maps it takes too long
[06:34.26]I'll give you my honest... I'm not going to give them a score of 1 through 5.
[06:37.84]I'm going to give you my honest opinions of what I thought about the demo.
[06:40.10]Okay?
[06:41.88]There are a thousand of these.
[06:42.94]So we kind of have to go.
[06:43.76]We're going to get started.
[06:47.17]I'm just going to pick out ones that I think look interesting.
[06:48.73]I'm going to install them.
[06:49.27]We're going to go.
[06:51.63]I'm already seeing some pretty interesting looking ones.
[06:53.21]Are you guys ready?
[06:56.49]How do you feel?
[07:01.07]You feel good?
[07:08.44]You feel good?
[07:10.68]Can I just test my noise limiter here?
[07:14.55]Does that sound fine?
[07:17.59]Eh, whatever.
[07:21.07]Okay.
[07:25.41]Some of these look good.
[07:26.15]Are these games even out?
[07:28.28]No, they're coming soon.
[07:29.52]These games aren't even released yet, but there's demos for them.
[07:31.56]This is kind of cool.
[07:32.26]What the hell's going on here?
[07:36.30]I'm actually... This is really cool.
[07:39.56]Alright, here we go.
[07:41.92]So as you see here... Hi, how are you?
[07:45.84]As you see here, we have quite the list of games here.
[07:51.49]Each one of these has a demo.
[07:54.23]And I'm literally just going to scroll through and see if one pops out that I think looks cool.
[07:57.79]I already got one I think that looks cool already.
[08:00.21]What's this one?
[08:01.44]This one's a roguelike?
[08:02.30]What do you guys think?
[08:05.54]We're not going to start at one.
[08:07.22]There are a thousand demos.
[08:08.91]We're not starting at one.
[08:10.03]I look like a fucking caveman today.
[08:13.31]Sometimes I look over here and I catch what I look like on the preview, man.
[08:21.07]This one?
[08:21.39]Alright, this one looks kind of cool.
[08:24.45]Alright, let me do this one.
[08:29.02]Wait, I can buy this?
[08:29.74]I thought it was not out.
[08:30.40]Oh, pre-purchase.
[08:30.98]Okay.
[08:31.10]Alright, so we're going to go for this one.
[08:33.17]I'm going to install it.
[08:33.83]You guys ready?
[08:34.91]This shouldn't take too long.
[08:35.75]I've got fiber optic internet.
[08:36.81]It's taking a little longer than I thought.
[08:48.50]It won't even launch the game.
[08:56.16]Is it ready to go?
[08:56.83]I'm like killing my internet by doing this too.
[09:00.95]Okay.
[09:01.05]What was this called?
[09:02.69]Cult of the Lamb?
[09:09.07]Where is it?
[09:15.56]Where is it?
[09:18.40]I just downloaded it.
[09:19.06]Where the fuck is it?
[09:21.90]Steam is not down.
[09:23.00]Is Steam down?
[09:31.68]Steam is not down for maintenance.
[09:33.64]Do not say that.
[09:35.28]What the fuck?
[09:37.30]What?
[09:42.16]It's down for maintenance?
[09:50.87]It's Tuesday.
[09:53.45]Oh, come on.
[09:55.59]The second that I turn the stream on is... Oh my god.
[10:01.53]I thought I only had one more day for this.
[10:03.40]I did not plan this.
[10:04.98]Why is... Fucking maintenance day.
[10:08.78]When does it start?
[10:13.82]When is maintenance over in like an hour?
[10:16.19]I'll play DreadX maybe.
[10:18.19]Tell us a story.
[10:18.85]It's back up?
[10:21.01]How would it be down for maintenance and back up in fucking two minutes?
[10:29.40]God damn it.
[10:30.92]Alright, let me see, let me see.
[10:31.91]Is it there?
[10:32.21]Ah, wait.
[10:38.21]Hold on, hold on.
[10:41.35]Hold on.
[10:41.89]Ooh!
[10:55.02]Tell us a story?
[10:56.55]What do you want for a story?
[11:00.09]It's down.
[11:01.79]I still can't download anything.
[11:07.89]I did not plan this.
[11:09.41]I promise you.
[11:13.81]Restart Steam.
[11:15.27]Do I need to restart Steam?
[11:19.62]It's not down.
[11:20.52]It's back up for me.
[11:24.76]When do they usually do this?
[11:27.10]Whatever.
[11:27.46]I just started.
[11:27.88]We're just going to hang out.
[11:29.83]We're just gonna hang out.
[11:32.45]The downtime is only about five minutes.
[11:33.85]Yeah, then let's just hang out.
[11:34.59]Whatever.
[11:35.57]Guys, it's not like World of Warcraft.
[11:37.05]They're not gonna bring Steam down for like 12 hours every day.
[11:40.19]Or every other day.
[11:40.85]Whatever it is.
[11:41.23]That'd be fucking horrible.
[11:44.83]Can you imagine if they did maintenance every other day for 12 hours?
[11:53.50]This game actually looks kind of fun.
[12:04.19]Expansion launch.
[12:10.82]It's every week.
[12:11.58]Yeah, it's every week, I know.
[12:12.52]What are you saying?
[12:14.00]Talk about... Oh, shit!
[12:16.08]That's right!
[12:16.58]This is insane!
[12:17.98]Can I just show you something?
[12:18.82]Well, I can't... I don't know if I can show you, but... This is absolutely insane.
[12:23.54]So somebody in the community... And let me just be very, very honest with you here.
[12:27.29]I've told you this a thousand times before.
[12:29.71]Nobody listens to me when I say this.
[12:32.47]But...
[12:34.05]But there's something really cool here.
[12:39.49]Somebody in the community is a fucking scientist.
[12:43.15]And they found, let me get it out here.
[12:46.21]I got to get some images here.
[12:47.11]This is fucking crazy.
[12:49.83]If you want to look into it, you can.
[12:52.77]So let me read this here.
[12:55.43]So, I have something really cool to share.
[12:59.44]This is by somebody in the community.
[13:00.76]Are they comfortable with me sharing their name?
[13:02.32]I don't want to share their name if they're not comfortable.
[13:05.72]But anyways, they discovered a new way of isolating viruses that kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
[13:13.87]Somebody in this community.
[13:17.23]And the first one I discovered using this method, I named after Jerma.
[13:24.60]This is a fucking goddamn discovery.
[13:29.38]They have pictures of the petri dishes.
[13:34.91]And this apparently is real.
[13:42.05]And they named it like the Jerva 985 like 80 thing.
[13:44.81]I don't know what it is.
[13:53.09]Let me see if I can pull up an image here.
[13:59.69]Yeah, let me just show you the Petri dish.
[14:01.38]Because this was shared with us.
[14:05.12]I was sitting there going, holy, oh my God.
[14:09.26]Take a look at this.
[14:12.45]No, it's not fake.
[14:13.13]This is real.
[14:15.57]It's the Jerma985.
[14:20.23]How do you pronounce that?
[14:25.32]So they're okay with me sharing their name?
[14:30.34]Alright, well, the name... I'll give them the Discord name.
[14:34.19]The Discord name is Jared Da.
[14:37.07]Jared underscore Da in Discord.
[14:39.79]And they have some fucking breakthrough medical research shit here.
[14:42.45]Like, it's actually phenomenal.
[14:44.61]This is... It'd blow me away.
[14:46.68]Take a look at this.
[14:54.60]Take a look at this.
[14:58.37]Alright, take a look at this.
[15:14.96]Hey, take a look at this.
[15:25.19]This is apparently it fucking working.
[15:28.37]Against bacteria, antibiotic bacteria resistant shit.
[15:37.88]This is real.
[15:41.04]No, this is not a kid in high school biology, alright?
[15:45.02]Stop saying that.
[15:46.20]This is like a fucking doctor scientist.
[15:52.42]But no, I'm flattered.
[15:54.38]I really wish you'd put your name on it.
[15:56.99]I didn't do this.
[15:57.63]No, they're not pancakes, guys.
[16:04.05]And I've said this out loud.
[16:05.43]This community has got a shitload of doctors, a shitload of scientists, a shitload of creative editing artists.
[16:16.04]There's so many people in this community.
[16:17.26]You're all doctors and scientists, and I'm proving it today.
[16:27.27]You need to infect yourself with this.
[16:28.79]I just drank this.
[16:33.55]I drank like a potion with like a bunch of... These are not pancakes.
[16:42.28]Do you guys know anything about scientific medical research?
[16:44.94]You don't know anything, do you?
[16:49.08]That's me in there.
[16:50.80]That's me taking care of that.
[16:53.74]I'm in there and I'm getting all of those fucking molecules and I'm destroying them.
[17:03.22]Let me see this one.
[17:06.31]Flooded second dilution set with the solution on it.
[17:09.39]Hold on, is this... It's a plaque essay?
[17:15.89]A purification?
[17:19.83]I'm not getting like gas lit, right?
[17:21.07]No, this is real.
[17:21.65]No, it actually is.
[17:30.16]Steam's working?
[17:32.00]Well, I don't want to obviously put... I want to make sure this person doesn't get flooded.
[17:38.76]But I wanted to at least share a little bit of that because that's really cool.
[17:41.76]Somebody found a way to target antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
[17:47.18]Put your name on it, though.
[17:48.08]It deserves to be you, not me.
[17:52.28]You guys ready?
[17:57.32]It's real.
[17:57.82]Yes, it is.
[18:08.94]the coming no it's not it's not gaslighting it's no it's not I swear to god it's not this I I just don't want to like blow up this I don't want to be like oh my god everybody go like that you know what I mean like it's a cool thing I just want to share it alright let's go I'm I'm gonna try to do this again let's see if it works I believe you
[18:37.82]Okay, you ready?
[18:38.76]Cult of the Lamb, install demo.
[18:41.42]There we go.
[18:43.46]There we are.
[18:49.15]Just kidding, it didn't work.
[18:56.85]Let me try a different one.
[18:59.79]You should play Smite.
[19:01.35]I actually need to get ready.
[19:02.37]I gotta play Smite.
[19:03.33]I gotta prepare.
[19:06.41]If you don't know what I'm talking about.
[19:08.77]I'm going to potentially be in a tournament for Smite.
[19:15.44]Mizgib is holding a Smite tournament.
[19:18.12]And I was very vocal about how badly I wanted to be in it.
[19:22.06]So I gotta, like, practice.
[19:23.19]Alright, let me try a different one.
[19:27.23]Maybe it's just that one's fucked up.
[19:35.21]okay how about now will this one work it just takes me to this their store page and then I can't download it alright so when I go to this it when I click on install demo it takes me to the store page and then it says download and I can't download it same
[20:03.57]Same exact things happening to us.
[20:05.87]Should I just open up DreadX and just say fuck it?
[20:09.40]Maybe I should restart Steam.
[20:10.40]I'll try restarting Steam.
[20:15.32]I like this.
[20:15.76]This is cool.
[20:16.10]Just kind of hanging out.
[20:17.06]Talking for a little bit.
[20:24.73]Is it working fine now?
[20:26.13]There's music playing.
[20:27.15]That's the trailer you're hearing.
[20:33.31]The demos go away... The demos go until the 20th, so if you can't do it today... Alright, well... I'm going to give this like 5 more minutes after I restart it.
[20:41.10]And if not, then we're just going to do DirectX like we were planning on doing anyways.
[20:44.80]So, it's all good.
[20:53.16]It's all good.
[20:56.92]Stretch the webcam out.
[20:57.98]Yeah, it is kind of a weird spot, isn't it?
[21:03.93]No, I don't want to stretch it out because it's going to screw up and I'm going to have to reset everything.
[21:11.60]Alright, try it again.
[21:15.24]See if it works this time.
[21:23.91]Okay, come on.
[21:24.71]Angerfoot, install demo.
[21:27.81]No.
[21:29.63]Download.
[21:30.37]Nope.
[21:36.72]Let me try restarting Steam again.
[21:47.31]Sunflower update.
[21:50.75]Haven't planted them.
[21:54.01]Here's the thing.
[21:55.02]There's a lot going on in the next month or two that I was kind of scared that I wouldn't be able to give them the attention that they deserved.
[22:01.98]So I was afraid to plant them.
[22:06.19]Oh, baseball, baseball, baseball, baseball.
[22:08.19]We got to talk about baseball.
[22:09.81]Yeah, whatever.
[22:10.53]I'm going to be streaming all day today, so don't worry.
[22:12.70]I'm not going to leave in like three hours.
[22:15.46]So... And you said it, and now I'm thinking about it.
[22:21.66]I should have planted them.
[22:31.42]Yes, I have a custom-made cup.
[22:34.09]Of the sunflowers.
[22:37.09]Okay, let me restart this.
[22:38.73]Baseball.
[22:39.21]Baseball, very important.
[22:40.01]Okay, listen.
[22:41.29]The baseball date has to change.
[22:43.73]It is no longer the 14th.
[22:45.65]It is not July 14th.
[22:46.99]The baseball date is changing to July 20th.
[22:51.51]Only about six days.
[22:53.05]We had to do a lot of changes.
[22:54.77]A lot of stuff with the venue and the... Trust me, we didn't want to move it, but we had to.
[23:00.54]So only like six days later.
[23:02.74]July 20th is the new date.
[23:05.28]I will let you know if anything else happens.
[23:06.88]If anything else goes on behind the scenes, I'll let you know.
[23:10.51]You'll be first to know.
[23:15.57]We had no choice.
[23:17.03]And when I say that, trust me, we had no choice.
[23:19.67]Had to do it.
[23:21.13]Alright, with Steam.
[23:22.21]Open Steam, please.
[23:24.31]I fucking hate computers.
[23:25.19]Alright, Steam.
[23:28.95]Steam.
[23:32.44]God, I fucking hate computers.
[23:39.94]The fuck is that?
[23:42.62]Alright, come on.
[23:43.52]Does anybody confirm that it works?
[23:44.98]Otherwise, I'm doing DreadX.
[23:53.61]No.
[23:55.37]What ever happened to this wor- This is five minutes.
[24:06.60]Steam maintenance download something on Steam right now I'm downloading something literally right now it's up I just restarted it the stream's gonna be like seven or eight hours guys don't worry I can't believe they would have maintenance during the big event
[24:36.35]Can't believe it.
[24:39.63]Wait, does he really think that Steam is down?
[24:45.28]So what's happening?
[24:46.72]What are you talking about?
[24:50.94]There's no maintenance.
[24:51.96]You guys have made it up?
[24:52.86]No, you didn't.
[24:53.80]Why would this not be working?
[24:54.76]Alright, I'm about to throw a towel in and just play DreadX.
[25:08.44]Okay, I'm going to give this until... So, the stream's been on for 25 minutes.
[25:13.60]If by minute number 30, we don't have some progress here, I'm going to dread exit.
[25:18.34]I'm just saying, fuck it, whatever.
[25:23.88]Steam has maintenance every Tuesday.
[25:27.35]But why don't they just... Why do maintenance at... I know that this is a North American Andy talking, right?
[25:33.93]Do maintenance at like 2 in the morning.
[25:36.25]Why do maintenance at fucking 4 o'clock in the afternoon?
[25:47.84]12 midnight maintenance or 1 a.m.
[25:50.10]maintenance means that that's what?
[25:54.52]Like 7 a.m.
[25:55.06]EU?
[25:55.14]6 to 7 a.m.
[25:55.54]EU?
[25:59.07]That's like 8 in the morning EU.
[26:00.73]That's far, right?
[26:01.93]You can wait till like 8 a.m.
[26:04.54]to play.
[26:15.78]You want them to come into the office at 2 a.m.? ?
[26:26.47]No, I want them to unplug the router.
[26:28.43]What do they even do?
[26:33.18]Speaking like somebody that has no idea how this system even works.
[26:37.32]To me, always, I would always get so, alright, let's talk about this for a second while we have time.
[26:41.40]I would always get so mad at the Warcraft, World of Warcraft maintenance.
[26:46.15]Because it was, I just, in my brain, it was, they were turning on and turning off the servers.
[26:54.13]That's, that was what they needed to do, and that was it.
[26:56.45]They just had to turn on, like, unplug, and then turn it back on.
[27:01.13]But then it got me thinking even more.
[27:03.35]What actually goes on during maintenance?
[27:05.71]What actually is happening?
[27:07.25]Are they like clearing out a bunch of cache?
[27:09.55]What is maintenance?
[27:10.41]What is it?
[27:10.94]What does that mean?
[27:13.64]Can somebody enlighten me?
[27:16.26]What does that mean?
[27:17.20]When they say, oh, every Tuesday, maintenance.
[27:19.24]What's that mean?
[27:19.88]What do they do?
[27:21.98]They're maintaining.
[27:23.39]But what are they doing?
[27:26.11]Cache, backups, updating hardware.
[27:33.69]Updating the system.
[27:37.35]Software updates.
[27:38.33]Backups.
[27:40.75]Haunt fixes.
[27:41.47]Hardware stuff.
[27:42.47]They're cleaning it with a toothbrush.
[27:46.07]It's maintenance.
[27:53.66]Because in my brain, maintenance is always... Okay, what is going on though?
[27:59.81]Are all these systems just barely functioning?
[28:02.15]And every week we have to turn them all off, and there has to be a bunch of fucking crazy shit behind the scenes to, like, keep them on?
[28:13.48]Oh, yeah, guys, just, uh, weekly maintenance, you know?
[28:15.94]Just maintaining things, just making sure everything works okay.
[28:18.36]Making sure that your, uh, stuff, your services are up.
[28:21.00]Not a big deal.
[28:21.84]It's just every, for a few hours every Tuesday.
[28:23.93]It's okay.
[28:25.07]But behind the scenes, it's like...
[28:27.48]We are a sneeze away from everything turning off permanently.
[28:31.86]Every service we have is permanently going to shut off.
[28:35.12]We're fucking hours away.
[28:37.20]Is that what it's like?
[28:45.23]And I'm just sitting back here like, fucking turn on my game, idiot.
[28:52.92]And right now there is a guy at like Steam, like Valve HQ, fucking running down a hallway with like a clipboard in his hand.
[28:59.86]Just like, okay, there's fucking a hundred fucking things I got to do.
[29:03.56]That system is in, I see red.
[29:05.80]I see red.
[29:06.40]I got to go to that one now.
[29:08.50]I'm just sitting here waiting for them to turn it on.
[29:10.12]And somebody is, there's a lot of drama going on behind the scenes.
[29:15.63]Residence lever.
[29:17.33]Just relax.
[29:18.33]No, wake up.
[29:19.23]Don't relax even more.
[29:20.17]You'll fall asleep.
[29:20.99]Stay, wake up.
[29:28.55]No, I don't want you to relax.
[29:29.53]I want you to like prep up a little.
[29:32.65]Is it working?
[29:36.27]It's been 30 minutes.
[29:38.19]Yeah, it has.
[29:38.63]Alright.
[29:38.83]Does it work?
[29:39.87]Let's try.
[29:40.23]I'm gonna try restarting.
[29:45.29]Come on.
[29:50.43]Hey, hey, everyone that said the Steam is only going to be down for five minutes.
[29:54.03]It's been 30.
[29:59.80]Okay.
[30:00.64]We're going to... Come on.
[30:01.68]Cult of the Lamb install demo.
[30:05.26]Dude, come on.
[30:18.68]Try a different one.
[30:19.66]I tried three already.
[30:20.98]Pick a different demo.
[30:21.70]Alright.
[30:23.65]I'm going to try a few of these.
[30:26.17]It's alright.
[30:26.57]We're just hanging out.
[30:27.07]Don't worry.
[30:28.40]Okay, how about this one called Potion Permit?
[30:30.18]Should I do this one?
[30:34.48]No.
[30:35.50]I'm clicking on Install Demo, and it's just taking me to the store page.
[30:39.18]And then, okay, so now there's a download demo, and I click it, and it just refreshes that game's store page.
[30:55.42]Exit Steam.
[30:56.10]I did.
[30:56.44]Alright, I'm gonna... I want to do this, though!
[30:59.52]I so badly want to do this.
[31:00.86]This would sound like a fun idea.
[31:03.18]Check your library?
[31:04.70]No, it's not there.
[31:07.84]Potion.
[31:08.80]Yeah, it's not even here.
[31:11.42]I really wanted to do this.
[31:13.54]When I get on something, I have to do it.
[31:15.04]I can't just not do it.
[31:16.73]Did you ban from Steam?
[31:18.27]No, I'm not.
[31:22.13]This dude's hallucinating.
[31:25.41]I am not hallucinating.
[31:31.96]They're not even doing a demo thing.
[31:33.22]You made it up.
[31:40.04]Alright.
[31:40.46]You know how I know that?
[31:41.44]No.
[31:42.06]I did a test.
[31:47.25]I have one already installed.
[31:48.17]I did a test.
[31:49.91]I did a test.
[31:50.67]Okay.
[31:52.53]Let's go.
[31:54.36]I downloaded one to test, and we're just gonna play it.
[31:58.58]Oh, fuck yeah.
[31:59.32]I'm excited.
[31:59.92]Let's do it.
[32:02.44]Before the stream started, I wanted to make sure it worked.
[32:04.26]You know what?
[32:04.54]It sucks.
[32:08.01]So before the stream started, I tested it.
[32:11.47]I got it set up.
[32:12.23]I'm gonna have it like this.
[32:13.91]Check it.
[32:14.63]Install.
[32:15.29]Okay.
[32:15.77]That works.
[32:16.97]I press the fucking goddamn stream button.
[32:19.89]Steam is offline for an hour!
[32:21.29]Like, what?
[32:25.96]Okay.
[32:28.88]No more ResidentSleepers.
[32:29.96]Are you going to make me very upset?
[32:33.80]Alright.
[32:34.78]The one that I downloaded to test, hopefully it's a good one.
[32:36.82]What should be the best one of the night?
[32:38.12]Could be.
[32:40.34]Could be.
[32:41.54]This one's called Melatonin.
[32:45.35]Melatonin.
[32:47.39]We're going to try it.
[32:50.21]Oh, shit.
[32:50.85]I'm so glad I installed this one.
[32:54.20]Alright, let's go.
[32:54.68]Let's go.
[32:54.90]Let's go.
[32:55.30]No more fucking around.
[32:56.00]I'm ready.
[32:56.30]We're going.
[32:57.50]We're already going.
[32:58.18]We're going.
[32:58.42]We're going.
[32:58.66]We're going.
[33:00.03]Where is it?
[33:07.01]Got it.
[33:08.27]No.
[33:08.53]Wake up.
[33:09.01]Oh, I think it's called melatonin.
[33:10.49]Never mind.
[33:12.51]Alright.
[33:13.09]This is a demo.
[33:13.71]This is called melatonin.
[33:16.66]Start the demo.
[33:17.24]Let's go.
[33:17.74]Let's go.
[33:20.99]This game contains flashing effects like lights and colors that can affect player.
[33:25.51]Alright, so we got a warning here.
[33:29.43]We got a warning right off the bat.
[33:30.79]Just be aware of that.
[33:31.99]So how does this work?
[33:37.97]Melatonin is a rhythm game that requires precise timing.
[33:40.38]For a dreamy experience, make sure your sound is on and avoid using Bluetooth audio.
[33:46.20]Bruh.
[33:47.74]Bruh.
[33:49.49]Okay.
[33:49.59]Let's start with the basics.
[33:51.36]Follow the rhythm and hit the space bar on beat with the moving circles.
[34:16.06]You're lagging?
[34:16.96]I know.
[34:17.19]I don't know why my internet's fucked up right now.
[34:29.53]The music made it worse for me.
[34:30.93]I don't know why.
[34:32.85]Why is my internet fucked up?
[34:38.29]It's Twitch?
[34:39.52]No, it's... I don't think so.
[34:40.88]Maybe it is?
[34:44.58]It's the fiber optic cables.
[34:46.42]I think it's... whatever.
[34:47.76]What am I gonna do about it, guys?
[34:50.02]Okay, that didn't feel right.
[34:50.94]No, it felt right.
[34:52.22]Let's do a quick tutorial.
[34:55.24]Recognizing audio and visual cues and reacting to them at the right time according to the rhythm.
[35:02.91]For the first lesson, pay attention to the cues.
[35:04.69]They will be hinting for you to react to the fourth beat when the circles overlap.
[35:14.77]That went in the circle.
[35:18.94]Every level in the game will eventually expect you to follow the cues without the visual guide.
[35:25.56]Wait, other streamers are having connection problems?
[35:27.56]Oh, that's annoying.
[35:29.94]Maintenance, maintenance, maintenance, maintenance, maintenance, maintenance, maintenance.
[35:44.59]Okay.
[35:45.93]Follow the cues and react with the left and right arrow keys.
[35:48.17]Left and right arrow keys?
[35:52.14]Do you remember you're having maintenance?
[36:01.18]Yeah, it's called when you sleep.
[36:03.02]You have maintenance every single day.
[36:04.59]Your brain does maintenance every day.
[36:08.26]Okay, there must be times when you need to start and end your reaction at different times.
[36:12.58]Hold the space bar on the third beat and let go on the fourth.
[36:18.71]Ooh, alright, that's kind of cool.
[36:25.33]Unique set of audio and visual cues.
[36:27.15]There's a practice mode too.
[36:28.33]Cool.
[36:29.53]If it gets too hard, you can enable the assist options.
[36:32.91]Okay.
[36:34.25]That's the end of the tutorial.
[36:36.21]Let's go.
[36:43.14]Well, it's like animated.
[36:44.68]What the hell?
[36:55.74]Whoa.
[37:07.38]It's an RPG?
[37:08.02]Oh my god, guys, it's an RPG!
[37:10.50]I look probably crazy.
[37:12.24]Fuck, I hate cameras.
[37:13.52]I don't want a camera in my house.
[37:18.65]I fucking hate this.
[37:21.15]What is this?
[37:25.19]Okay.
[37:26.91]This game's called Melatonin, by the way.
[37:28.75]The demo is available on Steam.
[37:30.63]Whenever the maintenance ends!
[37:58.45]Oh shit.
[37:58.87]This game's like Rhythm Heaven.
[38:09.06]Yeah!
[38:34.56]What?
[38:36.38]Alright, let's do it.
[38:37.34]Score mode.
[38:37.84]This is fun.
[38:41.53]Yeah, I would just keep it on games and demos.
[38:43.99]Because we're going to be doing a lot of them.
[38:45.25]Alright, this is cool.
[38:47.29]I actually like this.
[38:48.82]Let's do it.
[39:08.47]Burger.
[39:14.80]It's no cat puke simulator.
[39:16.80]Shit.
[40:26.74]this is fucking cool this is a good one this is a good one this is like rhythm um rhythm heaven what am I doing out of out of five this one's melatonin I'm gonna give you a rating on it once we can confirm with me that Steam demos are currently downloading for people how is it I think I might need a lot man might need a little bit more time with it I think
[41:03.62]Happy birthday to my friend, Aaron.
[41:05.34]Happy birthday, Aaron.
[41:07.30]The internet sucks.
[41:08.16]I don't know what's going on.
[41:09.02]Twitch's servers are fucked.
[41:11.28]Alright, cool.
[41:11.66]That was cool.
[41:12.48]So, let's go.
[41:16.94]There's another one, too.
[41:17.60]I want to do the other one.
[41:20.66]The demo has, what, probably two or three levels?
[41:21.98]Whoa.
[41:33.07]This internet is really making me angry.
[42:03.43]Sick.
[42:12.10]I'm gonna get 100 on this one.
[42:21.00]Use the chip?
[42:21.70]Yeah.
[42:22.08]And then freak out.
[42:25.25]Because you want to get it out of the machine.
[42:29.59]before it makes the sound.
[42:31.85]It's like, here it is.
[42:34.38]It's in there.
[42:36.00]Please remove card.
[42:36.66]Got it.
[42:41.36]And if it goes through one cycle of you fucked up and you're really embarrassed and like it's an anxiety time.
[42:48.55]What?
[42:50.79]Just buy it.
[42:52.37]Wait, what's going on?
[42:53.05]Restart.
[42:58.02]Is this right?
[43:00.48]Oh, I got it.
[43:09.74]And it's almost like I can tell when somebody's judging the amount of as I had.
[43:16.01]Pause it so I can talk.
[43:18.57]I've put it in there before at the grocery store, at Target, whatever, Best Buy, doesn't matter.
[43:25.49]And you put a bag into the cart and you hear... Oh, fuck.
[43:32.25]The second time, it's like you fucked up, right?
[43:34.47]The second time, it's like you caused that problem.
[43:38.47]And if it happens a third time, it's almost like you can feel the entire store all at the same time looking like, get your fucking card.
[43:46.48]I hate it.
[43:51.98]Yeah, I hate it.
[43:52.88]I don't like it.
[43:53.28]I make it like a nice sound, right?
[43:57.42]If the sound wasn't like an iPhone alarm, I'm sure it would be fine.
[44:02.85]Restart, restart, restart.
[44:16.30]I got it.
[44:37.31]Imagine you were so rich that you buying millions of dollars in merchandise is a fucking minigame.
[44:51.54]Like, can you imagine sitting there and they're like, wait, wait, hold on.
[44:56.32]Be like, you're a dick.
[44:58.04]You're a fucking asshole.
[45:15.69]I would not do that.
[45:16.57]Still can't download demos?
[45:48.52]Jerma does this at Applebee's.
[45:53.28]What does that even mean?
[45:54.16]I don't know.
[45:55.02]I don't know what that means.
[46:01.24]I'm trying.
[46:01.88]After you said that, I thought it was funny, but then at the same time, I'm like, what is that person talking about?
[46:08.02]You get a bill at the very end.
[46:10.76]Does that mean that I'm leaving and coming back and just charge?
[46:13.20]Hey, can you charge more breadsticks?
[46:17.49]Can I have another Bloomin' Onion?
[46:20.15]You don't even swipe.
[46:20.95]They take your card and walk away with it.
[46:29.01]Maybe I should try changing Twitch servers.
[46:32.03]I might try that.
[46:39.91]Stream's gonna turn off potentially, but we'll see.
[46:41.61]If it doesn't get better, I'll try a different server.
[47:02.34]Yeah, looks like we're dropping 2% of all frames.
[47:05.88]I don't like that.
[47:26.85]This game's really cool.
[47:29.21]I love Rhythm Heaven, and this is a Rhythm Heaven game.
[47:31.94]PC!
[47:33.64]Let's go.
[47:38.36]The game is called Melatonin on Steam.
[47:59.45]It's demo available.
[48:00.95]This is the Steam demo day.
[48:02.39]Early.
[48:30.55]Wait, shoot?
[48:31.03]Where?
[49:31.14]Melatonin.
[49:31.96]The game is Melatonin.
[49:33.02]Should I put it in like the title or something?
[49:34.36]Alright.
[49:35.54]I'm going to try.
[49:36.16]Okay.
[49:36.32]Here we go.
[49:37.76]I'm going to, let me see something here.
[49:39.77]Let me, I got to test something.
[49:42.11]I'm going to see, let me do this.
[49:48.71]I'm gonna see if I can change the Twitch server because last time this problem happened when Twitch was having server problems, I switched to a different server and I found one that worked.
[49:57.88]So you want to try it?
[49:58.82]I think I could try it.
[50:00.00]I'm dropping a lot of frames.
[50:01.90]Two and a half percent of every frame.
[50:04.60]I'll try that.
[50:05.83]Games are now downloadable.
[50:06.79]Perfect.
[50:07.07]So let's restart.
[50:07.79]Let's just redo the stream.
[50:10.11]Right?
[50:10.87]I haven't even gone live yet.
[50:11.73]Let's just pretend I haven't gone live yet.
[50:13.13]You know what I'm saying?
[50:18.06]OK, let's see.
[50:19.88]Let me check.
[50:24.50]He's late.
[50:24.98]Yeah, just pretend I was late.
[50:25.86]Just tell everybody I was late today by a lot.
[50:37.11]Let me see if this helps.
[50:39.78]Yeah, honestly, just pretend it was late.
[50:41.22]And by the way, I'm going to be really mad if one person is not here when I come back in like a minute and a half.
[50:46.54]Let me try this.
[50:47.14]Let me see if this helps.
[50:49.45]I'll be right back.
[50:50.13]Give me two seconds.
[50:50.63]Just going to restart, try a different server.
[50:53.13]Okay.
[51:00.05]Okay.
[51:09.60]Fuck!
[51:13.26]Fuck!
[51:21.35]Yeah, I'll be right back.
[51:35.58]Hi.
[51:41.58]Let's see if it worked.
[51:43.97]I went to a different server.
[51:46.11]I'm sorry I'm wicked late.
[51:47.17]Oh, hold on.
[51:47.59]Let me do the... No, who cares about the intro?
[51:49.91]Nah, it didn't work.
[51:52.05]Didn't work.
[51:52.77]Got worse.
[51:54.33]Fuck.
[51:55.85]No.
[51:56.65]Oh, come on.
[51:57.53]Really?
[51:57.81]Oh, come on.
[52:16.03]We're just gonna have to deal with the other server.
[52:19.07]Because now it's worse.
[52:21.65]Maintainance!
[52:21.97]Maintainance!
[52:22.35]Maintainance!
[52:22.71]Maintainance!
[52:23.37]Maintainance!
[52:23.71]Maintainance!
[52:24.33]Maintainance!
[52:29.76]I'll be right back again.
[52:30.70]We're just gonna have to deal with it.
[53:06.44]I think I'm not dropping any more frames.
[53:08.22]I don't want to jinx it.
[53:09.04]I don't want to say it out loud.
[53:10.74]I don't want to say this out loud.
[53:11.72]But I think we're good.
[53:15.22]I ran a speed test.
[53:16.41]I tested to Twitch.
[53:18.37]I picked individual servers.
[53:20.95]I went one by one by one.
[53:22.95]I think I got the right one.
[53:30.16]Fucking maintenance.
[53:32.54]Alright, give me a second.
[53:33.46]I think we're good.
[53:34.94]I'm going to move a couple things around.
[53:36.76]We're not going to do a starting soon screen because we already did that.
[53:40.10]Round two, that's right.
[53:44.10]Clueless.
[53:45.62]We'll see.
[53:46.40]I'm actually kind of concerned, but whatever.
[53:50.74]He's on Wi-Fi.
[53:51.62]Wi-Fi Andy.
[53:54.09]Look at this beard.
[53:55.17]It looks like... Okay, you know those things where there's a magnet and you drag the weird magnet hair around the guy's face?
[54:04.82]I have magnet shavings facial hair right now.
[54:16.66]Why am I weird looking?
[54:17.55]What is it?
[54:17.89]Let's see.
[54:19.93]It's definitely like here and like here.
[54:22.35]You know what I mean?
[54:29.48]Somebody said, yeah.
[54:31.66]Yeah.
[54:34.62]That's your... I know, I'm just kidding.
[54:36.98]Welcome back, everybody.
[54:38.04]Welcome to the show.
[54:40.14]I'm gonna... Well, I'm not gonna tweet this stream out yet because I'm afraid to.
[54:48.08]What's my... What's my... I'm changing... My white balance is all fucked up.
[54:56.35]Is this guy Morbius?
[55:02.17]It's the hair flip in the back.
[55:06.99]Yeah, I'm going to go line by line here.
[55:11.97]Is this a secret stream?
[55:13.95]No, this is supposed to be a regular stream.
[55:16.69]But I got cut off a couple hours ago.
[55:20.26]Trying to find a way back into the stream.
[55:22.80]And here we are.
[55:27.52]You look tired.
[55:30.34]Yeah, tired of this shit.
[55:36.69]Tuesday maintenance on every fucking website.
[55:40.43]I'm tired of this shit, I'll tell you that.
[55:46.78]Searching across the nation for a server I can stream to on Twitch.
[55:54.00]Late night stream?
[55:54.64]Yeah, we'll go as long.
[55:55.38]I don't want to go too long.
[55:56.92]I wanted to stream today.
[55:58.08]I'm so busy, right?
[56:01.93]I'm really busy.
[56:03.92]Today, I wanted to stream today and tomorrow.
[56:05.38]I'm trying to sprinkle streams in when I can while working on the projects and stuff.
[56:10.84]I wanted to stream today.
[56:13.56]Why do your sideburns look like pubes?
[56:27.47]Dude, I don't know.
[56:29.01]I haven't had a haircut in... Oh, man.
[56:37.30]You freak me out.
[56:42.90]I'm gonna cut these right now.
[56:47.45]That is weird.
[56:48.07]Anyways, whatever.
[56:50.59]You're self-conscious?
[56:51.53]No, I'm really not.
[56:52.27]I'm very comfortable in my... I'm very comfortable with my own skin.
[56:54.90]I promise.
[56:57.58]I don't care.
[57:01.14]You should sell your hair.
[57:08.24]The fuck are you talking about?
[57:11.61]No, never.
[57:12.49]Are you wearing a powdered wig?
[57:17.23]That'd be kind of funny if I was.
[57:18.87]Alright, no drop frames.
[57:19.87]I think we're good to go.
[57:20.49]I think we're ready.
[57:23.25]I wonder, is it because it might, is my hair going back further on this side than it is on this side?
[57:26.88]No, it's not.
[57:27.36]It's just the way that my hair sits.
[57:32.98]Because when it gets really long like this, it sits weirdly.
[57:36.34]It makes my head look like it's going back this way a little bit.
[57:39.64]He's balding.
[57:41.76]I mean, yeah.
[57:43.84]I'm 36.
[57:44.43]You wouldn't... You dream you look like this when you're 36.
[57:49.87]You dream.
[57:50.63]Keep dreaming you look as good as I do right now at 36.
[57:55.31]Keep dreaming.
[57:57.69]Wait, let me say that again when it looks better.
[58:05.19]Do not say F, liar.
[58:06.83]Don't do that.
[58:14.29]It's more like a nightmare.
[58:15.30]Okay.
[58:19.00]Okay.
[58:22.84]There's no F. I'm looking at it right now.
[58:25.25]I can see there's no drop frames.
[58:32.54]All 5,000 of us.
[58:34.48]Holy shit, what was just happening there?
[58:38.04]Can I get it to stay there?
[58:49.15]Why does this look good?
[58:53.54]What's happening right now?
[58:54.54]This looks good.
[58:56.32]Why?
[59:01.45]I gotta get away from- I'm just like being an ego weirdo looking into a mirror.
[59:06.91]Because right now, because I'm just sitting here- My OBS preview is right in front of my eyes.
[59:12.54]Usually it's over here, and I can't see it.
[59:15.60]Why does this look good?
[59:20.44]Am I fucking crazy, or does this look good?
[59:23.23]Like, this looks good.
[59:25.11]Do I look good?
[59:26.49]This looks good!
[59:28.07]Right?
[59:32.93]What's happening?
[59:33.57]Yeah, this looks fucking good.
[59:40.22]Can you please say I'm gonna... No, I don't get... You guys don't even... Sony put Morbius back in the theaters and none of you assholes went to go see it.
[59:48.40]So no, I'm not gonna do that.
[59:50.82]You didn't even see the movie.
[59:55.22]Alright, I think we're good.
[59:56.73]Let me tweet this out.
[60:00.07]Let me tweet this out.
[60:03.28]you changed no I didn't you did new tweet it's gonna say trying again I wanted to stream we're gonna try the game demos it seems to be that Steam is back please back up I'm I'm typing on my phone relax
[60:32.83]Should be trying again with a bunch of like the crazy, like the face, like I'm crazy, whatever.
[60:40.22]That emote, whatever it's called.
[60:41.54]What's that called?
[60:46.94]What is that?
[60:47.58]What is that?
[60:48.52]What's that emoji called?
[60:50.34]It's called zany.
[60:57.07]I was very upset before.
[60:59.07]I'm sorry, but I was.
[61:06.51]How can a streamer stream without a proper internet, a proper server to connect to?
[61:12.15]Huh?
[61:13.41]It's annoying.
[61:15.97]It's like a surgeon going in for surgery, and they're just like, oh, hey, yeah, you ready to do your surgery?
[61:21.68]Yes, I'm ready.
[61:22.90]Oh, well, there are no tools.
[61:25.14]You have to use your bare hands.
[61:30.26]I guess I'm just going to go home.
[61:36.18]He's comparing himself to a surgeon.
[61:41.96]I'm not comparing myself to a surgeon.
[61:44.34]I'm just saying that the tools that I need to be able to stream, if they're not here, I can't stream.
[61:52.80]Stop looking at yourself.
[61:54.03]Stop it.
[61:54.55]I got to get this off.
[61:55.49]I just like, what's wrong with me?
[61:57.89]What's that?
[61:58.31]Is there a bird or an animal that like, if it looks at its reflection, it just can't, it just sits there for an hour.
[62:05.41]I'm not even egotistical about this.
[62:06.99]I'm just locked into this guy talking in front of me over here.
[62:09.99]This guy in front of me is talking and I'm looking at him.
[62:15.86]Okay, let's go.
[62:19.52]Okay.
[62:23.17]What's the title?
[62:24.41]The title should probably be different, right?
[62:28.81]I would imagine.
[62:30.61]Let's get... Oh, that's right.
[62:31.81]I want to move this down.
[62:36.78]Alright.
[62:36.98]So I got called to the land.
[62:37.94]We're going to try that.
[62:38.44]This is, this is the demo stream.
[62:39.74]And I might just do this tomorrow too, because I want to be able to do it tomorrow rather than just bit kind of, I don't know how long the stream is going to be, but I w I couldn't go out on that bad one a few hours ago.
[62:50.61]Not going to happen.
[62:53.41]Okay.
[62:53.73]Put that here.
[62:55.59]Now I need, what do I need?
[62:57.87]Okay.
[63:02.64]Alright.
[63:03.94]So I need... Where's my Discord?
[63:06.81]Where the hell is that?
[63:07.51]There it is.
[63:08.53]Okay.
[63:11.47]And then I need this website.
[63:17.09]Give me one sec.
[63:17.89]Alright.
[63:18.61]So I'm going to open up Cult of the Lamb.
[63:20.96]That's the first one I downloaded.
[63:23.60]If you don't know what we're doing, I will give you another look.

[64:26.50]Can you hear anything?
[64:27.70]Oh, there you go.
[64:28.04]Now you can hear.
[64:30.16]That's not what I wanted to do.
[64:37.54]Yeah, I know.
[64:38.58]Who cares about your desktop background?
[64:40.65]Do you really care?
[64:43.19]It's nice.
[64:43.89]It's like a beach.
[64:46.25]I don't care.
[64:46.95]I don't need a desktop background.
[64:48.85]It's cool.
[64:49.83]I don't care.
[64:50.37]I don't look at my desktop background.
[64:54.00]I don't care.
[64:56.98]Press X. Wait, X as in X or X as in... It's a basic background.
[65:04.33]Yeah, you don't need anything more than that.
[65:08.50]Is it too dank?
[65:09.92]Is it?
[65:15.84]Okay.
[65:19.48]You stop being a minimalist.
[65:23.20]I don't have a desktop bag.
[65:24.24]It doesn't make me a minimalist.
[65:25.62]Alright, this is... What is this game called?
[65:27.46]Cult of the Lamb.
[65:28.42]Demo.
[65:28.84]Let's check it out.
[65:32.67]This is a controller game for sure.
[65:34.51]Guaranteed, right?
[65:40.28]Okay.
[65:43.96]I like the style so far.
[65:45.18]Work in progress.
[65:45.82]Okay, let's go.
[65:48.48]This is cool looking so far.
[65:56.11]So far, it's a five.
[65:57.41]Out of five.
[66:02.55]Magic of Wizard Wars.
[66:04.69]Mousepad Andy.
[66:05.73]Really?
[66:08.01]Really?
[66:11.07]Really?
[66:11.51]No, don't fucking derail this.
[66:13.13]I just got it started.
[66:14.01]I just was able to get it to go live.
[66:18.39]I'm not derailing it already.
[66:19.89]It was two hours of derailment last time.
[66:22.08]Kneel to be sacrificed.
[66:28.76]Okay.
[66:33.55]With this sacrifice, the prophecy will be impossible to fulfill.
[66:35.53]The heretic who lies bound below will be condemned to eternal captivity, and the old faith shall be preserved.
[66:43.17]Oh, these are old gods.
[66:51.51]Am I dead?
[66:51.81]Is this game like Binding of Isaac?
[67:02.70]What's this game like?
[67:11.11]Come closer if you're not.
[67:13.01]Though you are already dead, I still have need of you.
[67:16.09]Those foolish bishops thought they could keep you from me in death, but instead they sent you straight to me.
[67:22.74]I will give you life again, but at a price.
[67:25.56]All I ask is you to start a cult in my name.
[67:27.92]Do I have a deal?
[67:30.73]Um, you're sure.
[67:32.27]Wise choice.
[67:33.39]Take the red crown which I once wore with it.
[67:36.15]You shall command the loyalty of followers and strike fear into the hearts of our enemies.
[67:39.69]By the way, this is called Cult of the Lamb demo.
[67:42.35]What am I doing?
[67:43.13]That was weird.
[67:44.39]That was weird.
[67:45.79]I don't know what that was.
[67:48.15]That was very fucking weird.
[67:49.47]That was strange.
[67:52.29]Once you've done so, you'll see me again.
[68:01.53]Alright, so I let the Old God out.
[68:04.31]Put the Old God's crown on.
[68:05.64]And now I have the power of the Old God.
[68:07.02]Remember, this is Cult of the Lamb demo.
[68:12.32]What's wrong with you?
[68:13.08]A lot of things, man.
[68:15.06]Where do you want me to start?
[68:15.82]Whoa.
[68:30.55]This game sucks.
[68:43.95]Alright.
[68:49.38]Okay.
[69:02.13]Kruna, I am Ratau.
[69:03.31]I was once a chosen vessel like you, but those days are lost to the winds.
[69:08.47]I was sent to guide you.
[69:09.29]We're deep in the lands of the Old Faith and in grave danger.
[69:11.41]This game is actually really fun so far.
[69:14.74]Lead you to safety.
[69:15.56]Continue through the woods.
[69:16.44]Escape lies ahead.
[69:17.18]I'll be close by.
[69:17.96]Yeah, so this is again for everybody that's joining us.
[69:23.72]These are all demos on Steam right now for games that may or may not be coming out soon.
[69:28.61]There's a whole event.
[69:33.19]Would have loved to have been doing this all day.
[69:39.74]Yeah, so it is kind of like mining Isaac.
[69:43.42]Inventory.
[69:45.48]Coin.
[69:46.30]Is it currency?
[69:52.08]Those are probably traps, right?
[69:57.36]Do we have a health bar?
[70:03.69]One coin.
[70:04.01]I got two coins.
[70:08.44]I love the art style.
[70:09.48]It's kind of like this kind of pop-up book.
[70:11.94]That's really cool.
[70:12.40]I like it.
[70:14.54]Who's the composer?
[70:15.22]I don't know.
[70:16.04]Good question.
[70:27.56]This is good.
[70:37.42]It feels very clean.
[70:38.30]I would say it controls exceptionally well.
[70:43.52]Exceptionally well.
[70:47.66]The movement's fun.
[70:48.62]It's very fluid.
[70:49.28]Animations look great.
[70:51.54]There's no screen shake.
[70:54.52]Which, by the way... Why... God.
[70:56.94]Why God?
[70:58.66]God!
[71:04.74]Why does every fucking game studio now put screen shake in every single game?
[71:13.62]Why is it in every game?
[71:16.61]Why is it there?
[71:18.71]I can't stand this new trend.
[71:22.27]I can't take it.
[71:39.93]No, it's not here.
[71:40.55]Okay.
[71:46.80]Hold on now.
[71:49.22]Hold on a second.
[71:50.62]Everybody wait.
[71:52.78]They... Why is it in every game?
[71:55.28]I don't get this.
[71:57.70]I downloaded and started to play, just because I was curious, Diablo Immortal.
[72:04.76]And let me just be very clear about this.
[72:07.70]Fuck that game.
[72:10.88]Fuck that game.
[72:13.28]For a reason that you might not understand.
[72:16.92]Every time you swing the weapon in Diablo Immortal as a melee character, a default swing, your fucking iPad shakes.
[72:30.87]You can't turn it off.
[72:33.31]It drives me crazy.
[72:37.01]Crazy.
[72:38.41]It hurts my eyes just watching the screen shake.
[72:45.37]And I do this thing a lot of times where I type into Google, Diablo Immortal screen shake sucks.
[72:51.79]Just to get the confirmation bias from myself that other people agree with me.
[72:55.99]And I can't find it.
[72:58.38]I can't find it.
[73:00.50]Nobody agrees with me.
[73:09.98]Turn those off too.
[73:14.76]But man, I don't know.
[73:15.44]Screen shake... It doesn't add anything.
[73:18.95]It's just annoying.
[73:22.25]It's annoying.
[73:23.25]It doesn't add anything to the game.
[73:24.57]It's just obnoxious.
[73:25.91]I don't... Am I crazy?
[73:27.13]Have I... Have I lost my mind?
[73:40.48]He's a boomer.
[73:41.30]No, I am not.
[73:42.62]I am not a boomer.
[73:43.92]It's a screen shake in every game now.
[73:47.58]I never remember a time when I used to play... Okay, I just said used to.
[73:51.54]Whatever.
[73:54.61]Where I had to turn a slider down so my monitor didn't shake.
[74:08.39]Oh, I hated it.
[74:11.89]Everyone's talking about Diablo Immortals, like, pay-to-win bullshit.
[74:15.44]I am like the screen shakes, and I uninstalled it.
[74:26.54]Cool.
[74:37.17]We've reached safety.
[74:37.77]You've done well.
[74:38.43]Okay.
[74:43.41]Someone tell him his monitor doesn't shake physically.
[74:45.72]I think he's afraid of damaging his computer.
[74:57.76]I want to add screen shake to my streams.
[75:00.79]Let's see how you guys like it.
[75:02.93]Every time I talk loud, the edges of your visual is gonna go like this.
[75:08.73]Like this.
[75:12.34]I don't get it.
[75:23.14]This game, I, alright.
[75:25.20]This one's good.
[75:26.56]We're gonna get this one in five more minutes.
[75:36.60]Oh, also Diablo Immortal, uh, do I even really?
[75:38.92]I mean, everybody's already had their take at this game so far.
[75:40.98]Do I really have to add myself to the takes of Diablo Immortal?
[75:44.42]Do I have to give you my Diablo Immortal take?
[75:46.36]I mean, you've heard everybody's given their take.
[75:48.19]Every single person.
[75:49.21]You don't need me to, I don't have to give it to you, but I might.
[75:53.47]okay alright I will there are 15 items in diablo immortal that are there there are literally 15 items in the game whatever it is it's just like you you run these these riffs to get the same like 15 gems there are 15 items in the whole game all the other stuff I don't who cares
[76:23.95]Let the anger flow through you.
[76:25.13]Speak, speak.
[76:31.12]Okay, so I get a follower?
[76:33.52]Indoctrinate into a cult.
[76:40.30]What?
[76:45.65]Wait, you make... You can make your own, like, cult members?
[76:48.63]Right, I want the pig.
[76:53.63]Variant?
[76:56.63]Yep.
[76:58.85]Just say microtransactions are bad.
[77:01.56]That's really not even what I mean, though.
[77:03.26]I just mean that there are actually, like, 13 or 14 items in the game that you try to get.
[77:10.10]The whole time I was playing through Portions of Diablo Immortal, just on my iPad, because I'm an iPad gamer, I'm just sitting there going, like, none of this other gear, I don't care, like, this gear, it doesn't matter.
[77:20.55]I'm just opening a box at the end of a dungeon and hoping that one, like, a five-star version of the same 15 items shows up.
[77:29.22]It was just, it just ruined everything.
[77:31.28]I was like, this is ruining the entire experience for me.
[77:37.76]Okay, I can give, can I change these?
[77:40.88]Lose minus five faith whenever another follower dies, or ignore dissenters when they preach.
[77:47.05]Minus five faith when a follower is sacrificed.
[77:48.93]Huh.
[77:49.61]Okay.
[77:49.81]Okay.
[77:58.47]Chopped trees?
[78:01.32]Okay.
[78:02.56]Wait, what?
[78:05.76]Your cult will grow powerful, but your followers cannot live on prayer alone.
[78:08.70]They must eat.
[78:09.26]This game's sick.
[78:16.46]How come Jerma is at a different hue right now?
[78:18.68]Because I don't know, man.
[78:19.88]I'm tired!
[78:23.89]Okay.
[78:27.79]Build.
[78:30.45]Build it.
[78:33.49]Collect low.
[78:33.95]I have to do it myself.
[78:34.78]Okay.
[78:44.14]I can't chop that tree down?
[78:46.63]Wait, is that progress bar that small?
[78:49.33]Why did I pick the biggest tree at the camp?
[78:55.69]Okay, I'll do that one later.
[79:06.56]Cool.
[79:10.28]Okay, microtransactions.
[79:13.72]Look, I'm not going to sit here and go off on microtransactions.
[79:17.18]You've heard everybody give that take.
[79:20.89]My take is get screen shake out of your fucking video games.
[79:25.85]That's the most important takeaway.
[79:43.25]Stop talking.
[79:44.35]I'm a live streamer, man.
[79:48.46]Can I help?
[80:03.23]Okay, so let's build it.
[80:03.99]This is supposed to be Demoknight, but this game's good.
[80:07.85]Alright, I'm gonna move on in a minute.
[80:09.99]We're gonna do one more minute.
[80:18.17]Or, this is how I'll end it.
[80:19.35]If you're gonna have screen shake, please be like these god-tier developers and make it so I can turn it off.
[80:28.24]Be like these god-tier devs that knew and they decided to make it available for you to turn it off.
[80:41.26]Demo's just 30 minutes.
[80:42.02]Alright, cool.
[80:43.46]The followers need to eat.
[80:44.76]It's up to you to provide meals for them.
[80:49.89]The hunger of your cult can be seen in the top left of the screen.
[80:51.89]When this gets low, followers will begin to starve.
[80:57.10]Find more food while crusading.
[80:58.32]Pick routes that pass through foraging locations.
[81:01.68]Plant farms to grow your own food.
[81:02.92]See if it can be purchased and found while crusading.
[81:06.58]Collect berries?
[81:07.22]When is this going to come out?
[81:11.91]I want to play this.
[81:12.41]Oh, I have to hold it.
[81:18.79]Alright, you can cook food.
[81:25.00]I only have one follower so far.
[81:37.78]What's this game called?
[81:38.32]This game is called Cult of the Lamb.
[81:40.40]Cult of the Lamb.
[81:43.32]So far, so good.
[81:43.94]Okay, let's cook some food.
[81:53.40]15% chance of the follower pooping instantly.
[81:56.03]That's weird.
[82:00.65]What'd I just do?
[82:03.41]What'd I just do?
[82:05.77]Oh.
[82:11.06]Oh, wait.
[82:14.34]Okay.
[82:15.62]So, is that pig going to eat this?
[82:21.92]We need more followers.
[82:23.68]Okay.
[82:30.64]Slay them.
[82:31.46]Go and find gold and find recruits.
[82:34.68]Alright, this game's cool.
[82:35.76]Yeah, this is a good one.
[82:42.44]Kill Emdusius.
[82:49.27]One follower Andy.
[82:50.43]Hey, gotta start somewhere.
[82:54.47]You gotta start somewhere.
[82:56.21]You don't just wake up one day with... How many followers do I have?
[83:02.68]50?
[83:04.88]Okay, Darkwood...
[83:12.45]Alright, I guess we're just going to Darkwood, right?
[83:21.51]Who made this game?
[83:31.02]I have to read this.
[83:31.82]Jerma, if you were dreaming right now, would you show us your penis?
[83:38.60]You know how many times I've panicked in my dreams about something like that happening?
[83:43.23]Why would I do that deliberately in my dream?
[83:50.47]And mods let that pass.
[83:51.63]No, I caught it before it got deleted.
[83:58.04]Would you stop?
[83:59.08]Alright.
[84:00.02]Ooh, items.
[84:01.62]Quiet.
[84:01.78]Quiet.
[84:04.47]You didn't have to read that.
[84:05.27]That person needs to know.
[84:06.55]They need to be corrected.
[84:07.45]Okay.
[84:12.69]I want this one.
[84:17.55]Hell yeah, let's go.
[84:23.39]Wait, I take them both?
[84:26.13]Dude, you take them both.
[84:37.10]Whoa.
[84:46.90]This is good.
[84:47.84]Oh, yeah.
[84:48.18]This is a fun game.
[84:49.64]This is a fun one.
[84:50.55]Absolutely.
[84:51.71]Put this one on your wish list for sure.
[85:02.87]Hell, yeah.
[85:03.99]Yeah.
[85:05.35]Yeah.
[85:13.33]What is this?
[85:16.83]Praise Lamb, conduit to great power, promise liberator of the one that waits below.
[85:20.43]So the card showed me once many lifetimes ago, or has that yet to be?
[85:25.43]I always have drawn your cards, Lamb, and yet this is the first.
[85:29.47]Take these cards and I will draw another each time we meet.
[85:31.53]When drawn by me, they will grant you a power.
[85:34.39]A power that is both known and unfathomable.
[85:36.01]The cards they shall decide.
[85:46.85]I think this one.
[85:51.21]Yeah, whatever.
[85:51.89]Okay, cool.
[85:53.43]Got it.
[85:56.11]Tarot cards.
[85:56.65]Oh, these are the ones I have unlocked.
[85:57.67]Alright.
[86:05.68]I only have three hearts.
[86:06.42]I have to be careful.
[86:08.40]Oh, there's food.
[86:10.26]Nice.
[86:12.30]Nice.
[86:13.84]Does this get the Jerma985 stamp of approval?
[86:16.01]Yes.
[86:16.17]Yes.
[86:27.06]What's going on?
[86:27.48]Whoa, what?
[86:36.43]How can this be?
[86:37.67]You were put to the blade, lamb, as all your kind were, and yet here you stand before me, unrepentant.
[86:45.35]The crown, his power, could it be?
[86:47.98]But I am stronger still.
[86:49.02]Turn tail and run, little lamb.
[87:02.26]Bless you.
[87:02.60]Wait, inscription?
[87:06.65]Interesting.
[87:07.25]Okay, inscription.
[87:11.19]Alright, everybody, show of hands, how many people listen to the Angler's theme song at least once every couple of weeks?
[87:17.70]And just sit there in your chair and go like... Let's do the question mark.
[87:34.71]Whoa, that's a good room to go in.
[87:41.31]Yeah, the Angler from Inscription.
[87:48.13]One of the bosses.
[87:54.58]You guys don't know what the Angler theme song from Inscription is?
[88:00.06]How dare you show up here?
[88:11.43]Play it.
[88:11.73]I'll play it after this.
[88:16.73]I'm gonna die.
[88:17.19]I'm not.
[88:21.20]I gotta be a better gamer than this.
[88:32.46]Got it.
[88:35.00]I'm kind of sad that this is just a demo.
[88:36.36]I want to play the rest of this game.
[88:40.57]Oh, these are different weapons.
[88:45.11]PogChamp.
[89:08.89]When slaying a foe... Shh, I'm talking.
[89:11.77]When slaying a foe, summon a ghost that will attack nearby enemies.
[89:14.37]Cool.
[89:17.21]Projectile that spreads... What?
[89:20.32]Should I try this?
[89:23.06]This is a projectile.
[89:29.96]You can recycle stuff too.
[89:34.39]What does recycle mean?
[89:37.43]Wait, what?
[89:39.81]Oh, that's cool.
[89:41.17]It's just huge range.
[89:42.11]Alright, recycle it.
[89:45.99]Ah, it's money.
[89:46.64]Got it.
[89:47.66]Nice.
[90:01.37]Nice.
[90:05.08]Press Y?
[90:06.20]Yeah.
[90:06.74]I've been wasting it.
[90:08.58]Like a fool.
[90:20.01]Oh, it puts that tar on the ground.
[90:25.05]Shit.
[90:27.65]Alright, I gotta kill the boss.
[90:30.29]BatChest.
[90:34.01]Flower necklace?
[90:36.01]Ooh.
[90:36.33]I think this is the boss.
[90:43.70]Let's go.
[90:56.31]How do I build up the meter?
[91:05.27]This game rocks, it does.
[91:06.47]I would have moved on a long time ago.
[91:08.57]I want to see this demo to the end.
[91:17.63]Land the 1-2-3 combo.
[91:24.98]Ooh, that one.
[91:42.81]What hit me?
[91:47.37]Are we dropping frames?
[91:48.09]Nope.
[91:49.68]Good.
[91:50.94]So see what I mean?
[91:51.44]It's just so fucking weird.
[91:52.66]It makes no sense.
[92:00.91]You've come far enough.
[92:02.53]My followers are willing to do anything for me.
[92:04.09]Can you say the same of yours?
[92:06.99]I give myself to the cause, oh mighty leader.
[92:09.63]By the blood of the Great Ones, destroy the Red Crown.
[92:18.94]M. Deucius.
[92:51.37]Oh, wait, I can... I... Really?
[92:56.67]Convert me to your cult.
[92:57.40]I will follow your teachings faithfully.
[93:04.58]Ah.
[93:06.34]13 berries.
[93:07.30]Follow her form.
[93:08.92]Or berry bush, berry bush, berry bush, berry bush, berry bush.
[93:12.12]That one.
[93:18.68]Very cool.
[93:29.00]My face is so itchy with this beard.
[93:31.90]Locked.
[93:35.28]Return to cult.
[93:36.92]Is that it?
[93:37.41]Did I get to the end?
[93:39.23]Did I reach the end of the demo?
[93:46.65]That's it?
[93:47.01]When does this come out?
[93:52.22]Oh, no!
[93:52.76]No!

[94:08.68]That was Cult of the Lamb.

[95:21.61]Alright, we'll do Angerfoot, and I'll put on the Angler theme so you can understand what I'm talking about.
[95:32.33]Anger foot is coming up.
[95:36.79]It's because they're new.
[95:37.97]This is cool.

[96:46.59]You're a psycho.
[96:47.51]What?

[104:04.16]Again, this is called Anger Foot.
[104:14.34]Okay, for a second, I thought I was naked.
[104:22.82]I'm not going to kick the table over, am I?
[104:25.98]Wait, what am I... No, I don't want... This is... This is fucking weird.
[104:42.13]I'm just imagining...
[104:54.85]Somebody said, put it... No, I... Oh, I don't want to do that.
[105:01.20]I don't want to do that.
[105:02.44]No, don't do it.
[105:03.84]Don't do it.
[105:05.06]Oh.

[105:37.63]Oops!
[105:39.78]Do I have to pick it up with my foot?
[105:43.44]No!
[105:50.00]Put the fucking popcorn down!
[106:03.39]You'll regret interfering with the crime gang.
[106:06.57]Oh, this is fucking funny.
[106:08.99]Check your fax machine.
[106:19.34]How am I breaking shit?
[106:28.21]I mean, I can't read it.
[106:29.25]This is so fucking weird.
[106:42.05]What the fuck?
[106:54.50]Oh shit.
[106:58.46]This one's hard, okay.
[107:33.23]Blow it up, blow it up, blow it up!
[107:34.24]That was pretty dank.
[107:45.66]Oh!
[108:27.01]Fuck you!
[108:29.86]Can you please smoke cigarettes on stream?
[108:31.58]What are you talking about?
[108:34.06]What's wrong with you?
[108:34.83]Why are you saying that?

[109:25.14]Oh, secret?
[109:32.51]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[109:34.59]Why would I do that in reverse?
[109:36.25]I should have done that the other way.
[109:37.19]Why did I do that that way?
[109:38.03]That was stupid.
[109:41.00]Dumbass.
[109:42.56]Bah bah bah bah!
[110:31.03]What the fuck are you talking about?
[110:46.78]Shit.

[110:52.22]It's so addicting.
[110:52.92]I can't stop.
[110:53.57]And it's gonna end soon.

[111:04.76]Oh my god!
[111:05.46]Okay, this game is so good.

[113:51.61]Oh I don't like I'm not drinking one of these ever again
[114:05.54]This is like hotline- way too dank.
[114:07.52]Is it too dank?
[114:08.38]I'll turn it down.
[114:09.94]Is it too dank?
[114:14.88]Are we alright?
[114:15.48]We good?
[114:15.78]No?
[114:21.55]Wait, I can change the... tacky town?
[114:32.25]Whoa.
[114:37.42]Great for kicking doors and kicking ass.
[114:39.20]Regain ammo with every kill.
[114:41.44]I'll definitely take those.
[114:46.34]Alright, so I get ammo with every kill?
[114:48.90]Oh, new shoes.
[114:49.50]Nice.
[114:49.68]These look good.
[114:55.35]Wait, did I just do this?
[115:04.43]I just did this.
[115:08.87]How come it's the same level?
[115:11.15]Turn it up louder?
[115:12.56]I'll think about it.
[115:46.59]Oh shit, where am I going?
[115:53.47]Okay, so why did I do that twice?
[116:00.70]Level 5?
[116:01.08]Level... Oh, there we go.
[116:01.68]Level 6.
[116:01.86]That was a grenade!
[116:14.11]Wait, where did I go?
[116:15.39]Oh.
[116:20.66]I probably kicked the grenade back, right?
[116:52.40]Oh, I see.
[116:56.68]Okay, okay, okay.
[117:15.00]Oh!
[117:17.00]Shit.
[117:17.68]Okay.
[117:18.14]Alright, alright, alright.
[117:18.68]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[117:22.46]Dude, start over, start over, start over, start over, start over, start over, do it again.
[117:25.20]Start over, start over, whatever.
[117:27.02]Don't start, whatever.
[117:27.80]My nose is bleeding.
[117:28.54]I got crushed!
[118:02.90]Let's go.
[118:07.82]I miss the days when you didn't do cocaine on stream.
[118:16.07]Turn the volume back up?
[118:17.63]No!
[118:19.97]Level 7.
[118:21.23]This is a pretty long demo.
[118:24.15]New gun.
[118:24.59]Alright.
[118:25.05]What is this?
[118:28.77]Ugh.
[118:31.95]Shit, alright, I'm gonna die in one hit.
[118:35.70]You didn't deny?
[118:36.72]I don't do drugs besides marijuana.
[118:45.17]Enemy, do you count Tylenol?
[119:04.69]He admitted to it.
[119:05.31]Yeah, I take Tylenol sometimes.
[119:08.64]Who cares?
[119:10.04]Sometimes.
[119:10.58]Don't overdo it.
[119:21.20]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[119:22.36]Too many people!
[119:24.02]Ugh.
[119:49.73]Please give me a break.
[120:18.26]Turn it back up.
[120:18.83]This sucks.
[120:19.43]Oh my goodness.
[120:20.62]Fine.
[120:56.16]Does that help?
[120:58.23]Alright, I gotta be careful here.
[121:04.73]Bring it on.
[121:05.09]Bring it on.
[121:05.43]Bring it on.
[121:13.00]I missed the barrel.
[121:25.99]This game really has that one more time mentality on it.
[121:37.57]What are you doing to me?
[121:39.33]What is going on?
[121:40.29]What the fuck?
[121:41.71]I keep- I keep exploding.
[121:47.47]Oh my god.
[121:51.31]It's the barrel?
[121:52.05]Fuck, whatever.
[122:18.80]Let's freaking go.
[122:19.48]I have an idea.
[122:22.94]Where's that pistol?
[122:26.33]Alright, I have an idea.
[122:27.03]Here's my idea.
[122:27.53]Ready?
[122:29.99]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[122:51.87]Got it.
[122:52.27]Okay.
[122:52.80]Now where?
[122:53.96]Where's my shotgun?
[122:54.62]I want my shotgun back.
[122:59.26]How do I get out of here?
[123:03.14]Nice.
[123:03.40]Oh, this is the end of the demo probably, right?
[123:35.72]Nooo!
[123:50.90]I blew it!
[123:51.42]Fuck, that would've been so cool if I got it.
[124:28.18]My computer!
[125:02.30]Holy shit, this game is so hard.
[125:05.02]Fuck.
[125:09.00]How did I miss with every shot?
[125:45.38]What am I doing?
[125:45.76]Am I drinking?
[125:46.31]Is this alcohol?
[125:58.76]I don't know where to go.
[126:07.21]What's the...
[126:17.50]There was no reason to do what I just did.
[126:20.21]That was stupid.
[126:52.74]What?
[126:56.38]What happened?
[126:57.00]That was so clean.
[126:58.04]What was going on?
[126:58.85]What the hell happened?
[127:47.23]This game's fucking crazy, man!
[129:01.31]Is he dead?
[129:01.85]Alright, we're good.
[129:03.27]Okay, now what keeps happening here?
[129:04.89]Seriously.
[129:13.66]Okay, they blew up the whole room.
[129:15.56]Who cares?
[129:16.04]Go!
[129:53.64]Oh my god!
[130:03.13]Both of my feet went in the air.
[130:05.29]I like dove in there with two feet.
[130:12.36]Nice.
[130:25.24]Let's see if I hear auto.
[130:27.92]Is that auto?
[130:30.86]No?
[130:35.43]I've got like music blasting in my ear.
[130:36.93]It's kind of hard to hear.
[130:47.59]Damn.
[130:48.09]Alright.
[130:48.35]This guy's got shields.
[131:08.21]Okay, seriously, blow it up.
[131:09.65]Just blow it up, what the hell?
[131:19.00]Oh my fucking god.
[131:20.50]Oh my god.
[131:22.10]This game is too fun.
[131:23.11]I can't stop playing it.
[131:36.64]That's the strategy right there.
[131:50.25]What?
[132:00.26]Oh, come on.
[132:00.88]I almost got him.
[132:28.67]I think Jerma is doing exactly what they would do.
[132:37.58]What?
[132:37.94]What's going on?
[132:38.52]Why is it already freaking out?
[132:39.52]What's wrong?
[132:57.05]Am I hallucinating?
[132:57.77]No, I'm not.
[132:58.33]I thought he was talking shit.
[133:12.98]I... It's possible.
[133:13.68]The game's possible.
[133:49.54]Give me pistol, I want pistol, pistol, pistol, pistol, pistol, pistol, pistol, pistol.
[133:53.43]Shit.
[133:53.97]No, I don't want it.
[134:23.02]Oh my goodness, there's a lot of people in that room.
[134:28.54]Whoa!
[134:34.02]Whoa!
[134:37.20]Oh my god.
[134:39.32]Does it... Does it matter?
[134:41.88]I don't get it. ...
[135:27.14]What do I do?
[135:36.51]Fuck outta here.
[135:46.78]Level 10.
[135:47.08]This game is cracked out.
[135:52.12]I love it.
[136:07.42]That guy exploded.
[136:08.54]Why did that guy explode?
[136:29.90]Whoa!
[136:30.44]He's got a machine gun.
[136:49.06]Give me that shotgun.
[136:49.74]Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[136:59.86]What's that?
[137:01.64]Nothing.
[137:04.44]Come on, computer.
[137:05.05]Stop lagging.
[137:07.47]Not gonna fool me with that bullshit.
[137:08.57]Give me the shotgun.
[137:28.21]I thought someone was just knocking on my door.
[137:38.48]Oh, fuck!
[137:50.75]Oh my god, there's too many people!
[138:02.33]Holy shit.
[138:07.77]New shoes.
[138:08.39]Alright, we got... Wait, we got new shoes.
[138:17.14]Corridor blasters.
[138:18.92]Charge up a powerful long distance kick.
[138:20.69]I'll try it.
[138:24.35]Wait, more?
[138:29.15]Floaties.
[138:30.75]So soft you feel like you're floating away.
[138:36.86]I kind of want to try these.
[138:37.54]I think this is a boss level.
[138:42.04]What?
[138:48.69]Oh, somebody.
[138:50.15]Okay.
[138:51.85]Goob Cob?
[138:53.13]What?
[139:06.34]I need a gun!
[139:07.33]Is there a gun?
[139:37.53]Don't dunk off the edge.
[139:38.47]Oh boy, I went off the edge.
[139:42.71]Idiot.
[140:13.14]Oh shit, I got hit right in the head.
[140:15.66]That was a good shot.
[141:19.09]What the fuck?
[141:21.30]Why?
[141:21.74]Okay, stop it.
[142:03.77]Oh my god!
[142:04.83]Alright, back up, back up, back up.
[142:06.15]I need to heal.
[142:23.32]The fuck?
[142:29.79]Give me the different shoes.
[142:32.05]I want different shoes.
[142:38.97]Floaties.
[142:43.87]Turn doors into bombs, alright.
[142:48.55]How do these work?
[142:52.36]Whoa, okay.
[142:53.56]That might actually be a problem.
[142:54.80]Wait, why are they all floating?
[143:05.33]Why is everybody floating?
[143:07.69]Wait, everybody gets the shoes?
[143:13.72]Everybody gets them?
[143:17.02]I get it.
[143:17.42]Does that work?
[143:28.26]Is that doing damage or no?
[143:29.66]No, it's not.
[144:08.51]Alright, don't be an idiot.
[144:14.47]There it is, got it.
[144:15.25]Alright, we win.
[144:21.92]That startled me a little.
[144:24.02]What?
[144:24.90]Oh god.
[144:25.48]What's going on?
[144:36.93]What's he dropping?
[144:37.43]Oh, he's dropping bombs.
[144:50.06]Why will this not hurt you?
[144:59.65]Everybody's floating around.
[145:00.57]I don't know who's alive.
[145:06.48]What the fuck?
[145:07.32]Don't hit me!
[145:08.58]Alright, is that it?
[145:10.86]Did I get it?
[145:36.19]Oh my god, there's a phase three?
[145:37.83]They're just in a car now?
[145:43.07]Holy shit!
[145:46.59]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[145:51.17]Ah!
[146:21.83]Don't even holy shit that almost took my whole head off.
[146:25.93]That almost took off my head.
[146:27.43]Damn.
[146:33.78]I mean.
[146:51.04]That was amazing.
[146:52.34]Can I get that a five?
[146:56.84]I think that one deserves a five.
[147:00.19]Yeah, that was a demo.
[147:00.89]That demo was more fun than some whole games I've played.
[147:07.25]That's definitely a five.
[147:07.95]First five of the night.
[147:12.75]Damn.
[147:14.44]Very cool.
[147:21.21]Alright, what's next?
[147:21.83]Let's take a look.
[147:25.05]When does this come out?
[147:25.97]That's a good question.
[147:26.62]2023?
[147:35.54]Alright, that's a little wait, but it'll be worth it.
[147:38.92]That was phenomenal.
[147:42.26]Like, straight up phenomenal.
[147:47.07]Okay, let's go back and take a look at the list here and see what else I want to try.
[147:53.22]Guys, should we just do this tomorrow, too?
[147:55.85]I think we just do this tomorrow.
[147:59.57]Do Agent 64.
[148:00.07]Okay.
[148:05.11]This is actually really, really fun.
[148:09.86]I really like this a lot.
[148:11.06]Okay.
[148:12.20]Agent 64.
[148:12.70]This one here?
[148:13.56]I think, yeah, I got it.
[148:15.10]Do I have this one already?
[148:15.78]Okay.
[148:19.00]Agent 64 spies never die.
[148:21.06]I think I installed this one when I was kind of away for an hour.
[148:26.91]Agent 64.
[148:29.71]Let's give it a try.
[148:40.58]Yeah, I think I pretty sure.
[148:42.26]Yeah, I got this one.
[148:43.14]I had this one already.
[148:50.28]Alright, Agent 64 spies never die.
[148:51.68]Let's go for it.
[148:52.62]Agent 1.
[148:53.00]Let's do options.
[148:55.53]Make sure there's no goddamn screen shake.
[149:00.63]We're good.
[149:02.13]Wait.
[149:08.34]Okay.
[149:11.46]I'll keep it on for now.
[149:12.52]I'll keep all this on for now.
[149:16.65]Okay.
[149:17.51]Let's give it a try.
[149:18.03]Story.
[149:18.99]Tower escape.
[149:20.69]Agent, special agent, or a 64 agent?
[149:28.89]Sims music?
[149:31.89]We'll just do agent, right?
[149:36.76]What about special agent?
[149:37.84]I'll try special agent.
[149:48.72]This is Agent 64.
[149:49.44]Alright.
[149:49.90]Reminds me of Time Crisis.
[149:58.63]Action!
[150:08.10]Ooh.
[150:10.22]Man, why are these games all so good?
[150:14.24]It's like GoldenEye.
[150:15.44]Yep, it's GoldenEye, right?
[150:16.54]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[150:25.19]You play as Count Dooku in this game.
[150:26.93]No, you don't.
[150:28.53]Should I go... Where should I go?
[150:38.08]Here?
[150:38.99]Elevators are locked.
[150:41.31]Press mouse to target and shoot the padlock.
[150:44.13]Yeah, it is GoldenEye.
[150:54.35]I was just trying to kick that guy in the face.
[150:56.39]That was not gonna work.
[151:07.68]Got it.
[151:14.34]This is fun to play too.
[151:15.48]This feels great.
[151:32.14]Okay, so now where?
[151:39.86]Where do I go from here?
[151:45.59]Is there a sprint?
[151:46.17]No, there's no sprint.
[151:46.91]It's Goldeneye.
[151:49.57]Oh, over here?
[151:56.70]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[152:07.20]That's a little dank.
[152:21.52]Stop shooting!
[152:22.44]Stop it!
[152:33.97]Even the...
[152:37.63]Switch to the decoder.
[152:45.22]Got it.
[152:45.48]Is there a crouch?
[152:51.02]There has to be, right?
[152:53.04]This just is the facility from Goldeneye.
[152:56.27]I remember because I used to replay this over and over again and I would just kind of hide in the bathroom.
[153:12.74]How many of you guys treated the facility level, or Goldeneye in general, kind of like a Hitman game?
[153:22.59]It was kind of one of the first iterations of, there's AI and be careful, hide from them.
[153:30.36]Oh god, I'm dead.
[153:43.42]Why does everybody come out of the toilets with machine guns?
[153:50.41]Do it again, do it again, do it again.
[153:51.93]Oh my god, I fucked it up.
[153:53.91]I fucked it up so bad.
[153:56.37]Alright, last try, last try, last try.
[153:57.69]I'm gonna move on.
[154:00.37]I get it now, I understand what the game is.
[154:15.34]Dude, why do I have this distinct memory of Goldeneye?
[154:18.78]When you got to the end of the game, and I remember unloading on that guy, the last boss, and you can't kill him.
[154:26.19]But he took like 700 million bullets.
[154:30.81]That happened, right?
[154:35.75]Wait, can't you kill that guy in a random place or something?
[154:40.65]And the game kind of messes up, and the game doesn't understand that you beat it?
[154:45.74]Because you killed the boss way too early because you unloaded like a thousand bullets into his back or something.
[154:51.95]Why is this locked?
[154:56.77]Did I not get the key card from somebody?
[155:08.70]I didn't have the tutorial to teach me how to play.
[155:12.90]I forgot.
[155:13.40]I got this.
[155:14.14]It was like an hour since I last played this part.
[155:29.21]Nice dodge.
[155:37.58]Can I do that move?
[155:45.53]Why would the box explode?
[155:46.67]Alright, I almost have a ton of ammo for this gun.
[155:50.39]I do.
[155:52.31]Here we go.
[155:52.76]I have a lot of bullets.
[156:23.06]Ammo's so important.
[156:28.54]Okay, let's get that open.
[156:34.12]Alright, now don't blow this like an idiot.
[156:45.08]Alright, let me try to do this stealthy, so I don't get every single person in the whole room attacking me.
[157:02.16]Does that matter?
[157:25.54]Alright, I'm alright.
[157:40.02]I need a health pack so bad or I'm gonna lose.
[157:42.11]Is there any health in here?
[157:49.27]Come on, man.
[158:02.68]I'm gonna die.
[158:03.32]I'm out of bullets.
[158:22.86]What?
[158:27.50]Abort mission immediately?
[158:31.28]No, I'm not leaving.
[158:32.60]I can still get the flash drive with all the coordinates on it, whatever the hell it is.
[158:43.82]Got one.
[158:54.22]Immediately.
[158:54.98]Abort mission immediately.
[159:00.44]Don't... Excuse me.
[159:01.74]I'm not leaving until I get the... I'm going to beat the level.
[159:11.90]Jerma, stop playing this like angry play.
[159:17.45]I mean, I kind of have to.
[159:23.47]Please, I need it.
[159:24.09]It's important.
[159:24.59]Shoot a filing cabinet.
[159:25.49]I need to know if a filing cabinet will explode if you shoot it.
[159:28.46]They do.
[159:28.74]There you go.
[159:30.87]What about the bureau?
[159:32.45]Yep.
[159:33.19]What about the table?
[159:34.81]Yep.
[159:35.79]Everything explodes when you shoot it enough times.
[159:37.62]Okay.
[159:39.14]That's actually pretty funny.
[159:53.47]How do I beat the level?
[160:03.88]I already failed.
[160:05.02]I can't progress anymore?
[160:09.25]This one was really good, though.
[160:10.13]I like this.
[160:10.53]Alright, so that was Agent 64.
[160:13.77]Seems like a really close retelling of a... Kind of like Goldeneye.
[160:19.29]I would say very much fun.
[160:21.40]Very fun game.
[160:24.96]What am I... Did my head explode?
[160:29.55]Alright, that was a very fun game.
[160:30.84]I liked that one a lot.
[160:31.60]I would give that one a 4.
[160:34.96]I'd give that one a 4 out of 5.
[160:36.18]Alright, what else can we do?
[160:41.88]Agency.
[160:42.22]That was really good.
[160:42.86]I really liked that.
[160:44.11]Really fun.
[160:46.15]Let's take another look.
[160:46.71]Let's take a look at the page here.
[160:55.91]Okay, I mean, the one that's featured is Metal Hellslinger.
[160:58.93]Should I do that one?
[161:00.45]That one is featured right here on the front page here.
[161:04.99]What do you think?
[161:06.97]Metal Hellslinger.
[161:11.25]Potion Permit.
[161:15.45]Renown.
[161:19.48]Metal Hellslinger.
[161:20.26]Alright, I'll try it.
[161:23.68]This looks pretty, this looks pretty cool.
[161:26.52]Is this a rhythm game?
[161:27.24]I don't know.
[161:27.66]Let's check it out.
[161:36.15]Would my enjoyment and rating be better if it was offline?
[161:38.55]I don't think so.
[161:42.61]There are a lot of FPS games.
[161:43.67]There are more here that are not FPS.
[161:48.89]This game Potion Permit looks really cute.
[161:52.23]Midnight Fight Express.
[161:53.34]This looks kind of crazy.
[161:57.72]When am I going to get through all these?
[162:01.64]F. Yeah, the reason why you're seeing F is because I'm downloading a game.
[162:05.44]So it's a fake F. It's not a real F. Don't worry.
[162:08.84]Don't worry.
[162:09.76]It ain't real.
[162:12.50]Okay, so that was... Is this game going to be loud?
[162:19.10]I would assume probably, right?
[162:26.30]Potion permit next.
[162:30.53]Should you watch the streamer or watch Stranger Things?
[162:36.81]I mean, Stranger Things is going to be available pretty much at any point, whenever you want.
[162:43.85]You can open up Netflix and watch Stranger Things anytime.
[162:47.27]I'm only here right now.
[162:52.85]Stranger Things, whatever, I mean... Season 2 to 3 was alright, you know, whatever.
[163:03.85]It's okay.
[163:04.84]But I mean, Season 4, we're getting to the end of the show and everything.
[163:08.66]It's alright.
[163:16.26]You haven't even watched it.
[163:17.18]Nope.
[163:23.18]I saw 10 minutes of the first episode.
[163:24.88]Alright, this is a double headphone game, I think.
[163:32.32]Okay, I guess I'm going to accept the agreement.
[163:40.79]This looks good, too.
[163:43.75]Video latency.
[163:47.91]This is a rhythm game.
[163:48.83]I thought you guys were full of shit.
[163:50.21]This is a rhythm game.
[163:50.97]No screen shake, right?
[164:03.78]Okay.
[164:06.68]It's fine.
[164:07.67]We definitely want this at 90.
[164:08.45]Whatever, this is fine.
[164:14.67]Let's try demo.
[164:16.27]This is Metal Hellsinger Demo.
[164:25.61]Okay.
[164:26.05]Metal Hellsinger is automatically configured to provide the best ba- That was really quickly speaking.
[164:31.41]Okay.
[164:31.73]If you're using wireless headphones or the devices with high latency, I'm not, I'm wired.
[164:38.42]So I think I should be fine.
[164:43.58]That sounded fake.
[164:52.24]Is that me?
[165:21.87]You didn't do that to the beat.
[165:22.99]Didn't count.
[165:32.80]Well, that's a way... That scared the shit out of me.
[165:48.34]That's still too high.
[165:55.89]It's still too high.
[165:58.13]Holy shit, dude.
[166:00.06]A two?
[166:03.40]Three.
[166:07.02]Okay, we're going with three sensitivity.
[166:16.17]I hated him.
[166:25.12]Is this a rhythm game?
[166:30.76]Okay.
[166:48.83]Okay.
[166:51.79]It has to be on beat.
[166:53.83]That wasn't on beat?
[167:02.67]No, wait, hold on a minute.
[167:03.89]Like... Go get, go get, go get, go.
[167:09.39]Go get, go get, go get.
[167:10.97]I'm trying to swing and hit when it lands.
[167:14.18]Like... You know what I'm talking about?
[167:18.04]Because that would be... The sword would be landing on B.
[167:33.41]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun!
[167:46.52]Go get, go get, go get!
[167:51.90]Tap E?
[167:58.87]Slaughter gives you life?
[168:17.47]nice we didn't need words we understood each other without them guess it sounds like love at first sight don't it
[168:35.02]It's 1, 2, 3, 4, not 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[168:36.42]Alright, let's get it.
[169:05.00]Taz can be used for keeping Fury up, even without demons around.
[169:22.03]Okay, Fury meter.
[169:27.01]We need perfect beats.
[169:48.43]Den, den, den, den, den.
[169:51.75]Fury boost.
[170:10.23]Who sing- is this me singing?
[171:16.94]You can find all the tutorial, yeah!
[171:22.87]This is pretty, I like, this is fun.
[171:24.71]This is cool.
[171:25.25]Mop shit, mop, oh, mosh pit.
[171:26.21]Let's go.
[171:26.61]Enter hell.
[171:48.96]So this is actual music, right?
[171:52.28]This is actual songs.
[171:55.14]Alright, let's get a real taste and see if I like it.
[171:59.40]This is going to be a real test.
[172:00.56]Ooh.
[172:10.67]Okay.
[172:24.90]I want to swing that fast.
[172:59.35]Okay, alright, here's my take.
[173:02.01]This kind of feels like Doom if the Doom guy got bored in the middle of the game.
[173:14.17]And he's making his own fun.
[173:24.74]That's not a bad thing.
[173:59.65]so many souls here makes a kind of electricity music's really good too yeah every successful attack charge up weapons ultimate fire the ultimate
[174:29.20]Oh shit.
[174:30.74]Alright.
[174:51.63]Alright, where do I go now?
[174:57.93]Ooh.
[175:41.88]This game is fucking phenomenal!
[176:45.14]Holy shit!
[176:46.04]She saw something.
[176:46.82]Imagine it, baby.
[177:29.43]200k.
[177:30.42]How do I heal?
[177:38.19]Oh, right.
[177:38.71]I know how to heal.
[178:16.20]I forgot to blink, you're right.
[178:58.16]Let's go!
[179:05.98]I already know, man.
[179:06.98]I'm already a professional.
[179:07.92]I already have to reload on the B2.
[179:17.81]I just swallowed a bunch of spit.
[179:18.93]That was gross.
[179:31.32]Alright, where do I go?
[179:32.70]I'm so locked in just playing the game, I don't know what direction I'm going.
[179:43.49]I'm going backwards?
[179:50.58]Where do I go?
[179:51.00]How did I turn around?
[179:53.34]I don't know, I went through a door.
[179:54.24]Why am I going- I don't know, am I going backwards?
[180:00.29]I don't know where to go.
[180:01.59]Why am I drooling?
[180:02.71]I'm not drooling.
[180:05.35]What do you mean I'm not drooling?
[180:06.67]Dude, you're really fucking up the flow.
[180:09.98]I'm sorry.
[180:10.62]Am I going the right way?
[180:14.16]There it is.
[180:17.54]I'll make it up for you.
[180:18.18]I'll make it up for you.
[180:18.72]I'll make it up.
[181:06.81]Ooh lightning!
[181:19.77]Mop shit, yeah.
[181:40.22]That was an advanced technique.
[181:41.57]I wouldn't try that if I were you.
[182:10.81]Where do I go?
[182:11.70]Where do I go from here?
[182:26.03]Offbeat.
[182:41.17]Okay, now what?
[182:49.72]These games have been absolutely wonderful!
[182:53.16]How come I didn't find out about these games until the last second?
[182:57.44]These have been really wonderful.
[182:58.90]This has been a wonderful experience.
[183:00.48]4x4 hogwash.
[183:10.68]Boss time.
[183:24.61]Well, there's your 4x4 hogwash.
[183:26.41]It ain't 4x4, is it?
[183:51.66]I don't even know what the boss is!
[184:00.31]Ow!
[184:01.37]Oh my god!
[184:02.23]Resurrect.
[184:46.07]Whoa, whoa, whoa, that music changed!
[185:10.28]What?
[185:10.50]I'm so confused.
[185:54.95]Behold the face of infernal justice!
[186:38.14]Oh shit!
[186:39.28]No, don't kill me!
[186:44.60]There's stuff over here.
[186:45.10]Wait, wait, wait.
[186:45.58]I'm good.
[186:50.38]No!
[186:51.24]What happened?
[186:55.36]I'm so confused.
[186:56.30]I don't know what just happened.
[186:57.37]Resurrect, resurrect.
[187:00.65]It's a lot of stimulation.
[187:01.73]It's a lot of stimulation.
[187:03.00]It's a ton of stimulation.
[187:25.15]Damn.
[187:26.87]That was crazy.
[187:29.39]That was so stimulating.
[187:35.98]That was very stimulating.
[187:44.10]Is that the end?
[187:44.64]There I am.
[187:47.44]Gas can.
[187:54.87]45,414.
[187:56.03]Why am I clicking up here?
[187:57.03]Like it's a menu.
[188:02.18]That's not bad.
[188:03.24]This, how many people are on Earth?
[188:07.30]Alright.
[188:13.24]I give this one a, alright.
[188:15.84]This is definitely a game that's apps.
[188:19.52]Okay.
[188:20.64]This game is going to be very hard.
[188:23.25]Because you know the music's going to change halfway through the game here.
[188:26.47]And it's going to be unbelievably difficult to keep tempo and fire and dodge at the same time.
[188:32.40]So I'm going to give this demo, this was Metal Hellsinger, a 3.9.
[188:43.26]I'm going to give this a 3.9 out of 5.
[188:47.00]For the demo.
[188:48.76]For the demo. 3.9.
[188:57.36]It could have been like a 4-6.
[189:00.64]But I feel like this game is going to be way too hard for me.
[189:03.90]I think this game is going to be very difficult for me.
[189:05.84]So I'm going to give it... That's not a low score.
[189:07.79]I think that's a pretty good score.
[189:17.03]You give Agent 64 a 4 out of 5.
[189:19.55]Oh shit, you're right.
[189:20.35]Okay, flip him.
[189:22.70]Agent 64 is a 3... Hold on.
[189:25.76]Agent 64, 3.6.
[189:28.81]No, 3.4.
[189:32.19]Hail Singer, 3.9.
[189:34.37]That's better.
[189:36.23]That's better.
[189:42.01]Okay.
[189:42.55]Very cool.
[189:43.03]Let's check.
[189:43.35]What else can we do?
[189:44.45]Let's do another one.
[189:48.73]The three or four games we played today have... I mean, I wish I played more, obviously, but the stream had to start much later.
[189:54.32]Which I'm glad that we're not having any internet problems.
[189:56.32]So, I'm glad that's solved.
[189:59.28]That's low?
[190:00.28]No, it's not.
[190:03.84]A 3.9 is a solid, like, B, isn't it?
[190:05.37]Like a B+.
[190:10.07]Okay.
[190:11.31]We did all these three.
[190:14.17]Potion Permit.
[190:16.59]Should we give this one a try?
[190:19.97]Midnight Fight Express.
[190:24.71]Roots of Pacha.
[190:26.96]Okay, I'm going to be honest.
[190:27.74]I'm going to scroll.
[190:29.40]I'm probably going to skip things that I don't think I'd be really interested in in the first place.
[190:37.58]There's Agent 64.
[190:38.86]Goodbye World.
[190:42.56]Escape Academy?
[190:45.27]This one could be good.
[190:48.59]Frozen Flame.
[190:50.87]This could be good, too.
[190:55.89]Any on this list that I don't want to skip?
[191:01.01]I don't know.
[191:01.89]This looks cute, though, doesn't it?
[191:05.27]How many are there?
[191:07.35]Hundreds.
[191:12.49]This game's a visual novel?
[191:13.83]Is this a visual novel game?
[191:16.37]Even if it is, it's fun.
[191:22.61]I think I'm more into this one than this one just because I like, I don't know, I like kind of jumping around and shooting.
[191:28.66]I'll try Midnight Fight Express.
[191:42.37]By the way, we're going to do this tomorrow and we're going to, this, I wanted just to come back and actually have a stream today.
[191:48.13]But tomorrow, we're going to do this all day.
[191:52.32]So don't worry.
[191:54.26]We'll try to get to at least a few dozen of these, I think, over the course of the day tomorrow.
[191:58.96]Alright, Midnight Fight Express.
[192:00.48]Is this a beat-em-up game?
[192:01.40]Is it controller?
[192:15.41]Let's give it a try.
[192:23.04]Nah, you're going to see many Fs when I download a game.
[192:24.96]Okay.
[192:31.54]We've seen a lot of... This game contains bright flashing lights warnings.
[192:36.02]Loading failed.
[192:36.90]What?
[192:38.14]Oh.
[192:39.82]Okay.
[192:42.53]Game.
[192:46.33]And there it is.
[192:47.19]And there it goes down to zero.
[192:50.17]Let's take this down to zero too.
[192:53.36]Thank goodness.
[193:04.47]These are all cracked out games.
[193:05.97]They kind of are.
[193:09.31]Blood settings.
[193:09.91]That's fine.
[193:10.39]Alright, let's go.
[193:15.08]That's fine.
[193:15.74]Don't matter.
[193:16.12]I think it's good.
[193:16.84]Default is good.
[193:17.48]Let's just go.
[193:18.64]We're going to do normal.
[193:21.30]Let's do it.
[193:25.40]I don't want my mom to see Please Turn the Blood Off.
[193:32.61]This game is made by one guy, by the way.
[193:36.63]So Babyface, right?
[193:37.27]I'm going to call you that since our records don't show anything else.
[193:40.62]Kind of like you're a ghost.
[193:41.46]We don't like ghosts.
[193:42.78]They have a tendency to cause trouble and disappear.
[193:44.44]Classic ghost.
[193:46.94]Listen up, you claim innocents.
[193:47.76]No memory from before the attack began, so you were just trying to help.
[193:51.76]Do I have to close on?
[193:53.34]But we know that isn't true.
[193:55.34]You're part of this whole thing, the attack on the city, mobilizing the gangs, all of it.
[193:59.30]What we don't know is why.
[194:00.52]If we figure out the why, we can figure out the how, and then we can stop the how.
[194:05.74]Come on, buddy, tell us the why.
[194:06.72]Help us save the city, and maybe you won't get the death penalty, maybe.
[194:11.22]Retrace your steps.
[194:12.46]Don't hold back, or else we certainly won't.
[194:14.00]Now, what's this about a talking drone?
[194:20.21]Stop the how?
[194:32.25]Okay.
[194:37.48]Damn.
[194:38.20]Okay, cool.
[194:39.20]A is interact with objects?
[194:46.24]This chaos in the city.
[194:48.69]There's criminals everywhere.
[194:49.81]Be careful.
[194:50.21]Take care of yourself.
[194:57.31]Let me out of here.
[194:57.85]Oh, it's the drone.
[195:01.64]Okay.
[195:05.66]Don't think I need to tell you.
[195:06.64]Beautiful city of tomorrow has gone to all sorts of hell.
[195:08.50]Could really use a little saving.
[195:09.56]Here's the deal.
[195:10.82]You're a sleeper agent, a brutal mercenary in a trance, waiting for a drone and shining armor like yours truly to wake you up from this little dream.
[195:18.67]I only ask you one itsy-bitsy favor in turn.
[195:20.71]Help me save the city and all the good-hearted schmucks in it before sunup or the crooks will get full control.
[195:27.32]Do that, you'll get your real life back and the city sees a brighter tomorrow after all.
[195:34.73]I know I paraphrase everything in dialog.
[195:37.80]Look, I know.
[195:39.84]I'm unbearable.
[195:41.58]If there's dialog in a game, you get two options.
[195:45.62]It won't be tomorrow, okay, or... Or... I'll tell you, we need to save this city.
[195:53.87]I either go full-on voice acting, or I just paraphrase every sentence.
[195:58.21]And I'm sorry, that's just the way it is.
[196:00.90]I don't read dialog.
[196:03.94]Okay, I can't.
[196:04.38]Who am I fighting?
[196:06.38]Give us the second option?
[196:07.38]Fine.
[196:07.72]It's always just Mr. Satan talking.
[196:23.50]Oh, I almost forgot.
[196:25.40]Gotta reactivate you.
[196:26.48]Applying a little noise cream should warm up those muscles right up.
[196:34.93]They all have this music.
[196:48.43]It's a music game.
[196:51.59]And I gotta do it to the beat.
[197:05.25]It's loud.
[197:14.94]Beat him up.
[197:20.40]Rip Bozo.
[197:24.06]Alright.
[197:24.64]Alright.
[197:25.00]It's alright.
[197:26.03]Okay.
[197:33.04]I don't have Rip Bozo on this channel.
[197:36.08]Block?
[197:37.47]Oh, it's the Superman game stuff.
[197:39.87]On perfect blocks, hit left bumper.
[198:10.19]Heavy strike.
[198:12.34]Ah, I see.
[198:13.00]It has to be a perfect dodge.
[198:22.24]Oh, off the building.
[198:25.10]Wow.
[198:29.86]Why can I not get the... That's not a perfect dodge?
[198:32.84]Hold on, let me try to get this down.
[198:36.02]Swing at me.
[198:50.15]How come I can't do it?
[198:52.31]Dude, rip Bozo, holy shit.
[198:55.59]You can't read.
[198:56.37]I know, I'm doing a heavy strike right now.
[198:59.06]Hey listen, Bozo.
[199:26.21]It's fun.
[199:26.77]It's alright.
[199:27.87]It's fun.
[199:37.96]The rage meter builds up and when you get in rage, you do combat moves.
[199:41.24]I don't hate it.
[199:55.57]Where are you getting that idea?
[199:56.29]I don't hit it.
[200:02.80]Wait, they think I'm the pizza guy?
[200:03.96]Dude.
[200:10.38]Pizza tonight.
[200:12.57]Pizza tonight.
[200:13.19]That's what I'm thinking.
[200:35.67]Okay, break their defense.
[200:38.77]Melee weapons?
[200:43.73]Yeah, it's just, it's Batman.
[201:03.31]It's Batman.
[201:06.46]I could say you could get really good at this and really string combos together and stuff.
[201:13.39]There's probably melee weapons.
[201:14.65]Ooh, there is a dodge.
[201:16.87]Okay, now the game just got way better.
[201:18.35]Ooh, I can pick that up.
[201:32.56]How do I pick it up?
[201:35.32]I want to pick up the weapon.
[201:37.16]I definitely can pick it up as soon as I can.
[201:46.77]How do I pick that up?
[201:48.01]Right bumper.
[201:48.79]Ooh, nice.
[201:49.53]Alright, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[201:55.53]Give me the bat.
[202:03.39]Don't come any closer or I'll slit this.
[202:05.35]You have a wrench in your hand?
[202:12.08]That was dangerous.
[202:20.90]Jesus.
[202:21.54]Okay.
[202:24.90]Focus.
[202:25.56]You can scan the environment.
[202:29.93]Interesting.
[202:30.39]Okay.
[202:48.94]Photo mode.
[202:56.99]I got a good photo.
[202:57.53]Alright, whatever.
[203:06.41]Ooh, really?
[203:07.35]What happened?
[203:10.94]What just happened?
[203:13.32]Oh, I... Okay.
[203:15.90]You have to hold it.
[203:23.56]Alright, this... Yeah.
[203:25.88]This is fucking fucked up.
[203:31.26]They should not have let me do this, because I'm not going to do anything else.
[203:43.17]Bozos.
[203:44.45]Guns?
[203:44.83]There's guns in the game, too.
[203:46.25]What?
[203:46.55]Okay.
[203:50.92]Okay.
[204:03.29]This is a 3-8.
[204:03.95]No, it's not.
[204:06.49]This is your hideout?
[204:17.58]Each level has its own unique items that you can unlock by completing challenges.
[204:21.33]Challenge listed here after the level's unlocked.
[204:24.53]Learn more about the enemies you'll fight.
[204:27.75]Each level you can earn money, skills, and upgrades.
[204:32.99]Appearance the playground your progression tab is a lot here I'm in trouble.
[204:45.32]I'm in I'm gonna be in trouble.
[204:48.00]I'm in trouble.
[204:48.76]I'm in trouble Okay, I want to do throw stuff at people
[204:58.53]Grapple enemies.
[205:00.45]Follow up chain strikes.
[205:02.55]Parry and count.
[205:03.25]Oh, parry.
[205:05.13]This is a... Okay, I thought this was way... I'm going to be honest with you.
[205:08.90]The first five minutes of this game, I was like, yeah, it's a two.
[205:12.82]Seeing all this.
[205:15.50]Just bumped up somewhere in the threes.
[205:20.80]Yeah, this was a two when I first started.
[205:27.59]Let's do grapple.
[205:32.26]Cool.
[205:33.25]Yeah, I want it.
[205:37.54]Okay, assign it.
[205:38.82]Okay, cool.
[205:47.97]The game needs screen shake.
[205:49.09]There is a screen check option in there.
[205:50.43]Actually, I want to make a point with this.
[205:53.21]I want to keep... You guys keep tabs.
[205:56.41]Keep track of the games we're playing.
[205:57.59]Tomorrow we're going to do the same thing.
[205:59.69]Keep track of how many games have screen shake enabled in the options.
[206:05.33]This is an experiment.
[206:07.62]Turn it on?
[206:08.28]Sure.
[206:09.70]Let's see what it's like with screen shake on.
[206:10.98]I'm sorry.
[206:12.10]We need to prove this point.
[206:37.63]All all screen shake does is just move the camera in closer and move it around and shake it around How much worse is this game now That every time I swing I go
[207:02.32]And this one, I will give credit to the dev here.
[207:05.06]This one's not as egregious as a lot of them really are.
[207:08.93]I understand impact, right?
[207:11.31]But some of them, there's this lateral shake that some of them do.
[207:16.19]So this one's going like this.
[207:17.59]So here's your screen, right?
[207:18.98]Here's your screen.
[207:20.46]This one's going like this.
[207:23.44]Like that.
[207:24.96]A lot of these fucking stupid ass games go like this.
[207:32.57]That's the one I'm talking about.
[207:34.51]Not the one that goes like this.
[207:37.29]The one that goes... I hate that trend so much.
[207:43.64]I quit video games if it stays.
[207:52.24]Have you noticed?
[207:52.82]Do you see what's going on here?
[207:54.42]Take a look.
[207:55.44]Have you puked yet?
[208:09.73]You're so dramatic.
[208:11.65]I'm kidding.
[208:14.47]I'm not gonna quit video games because some games have a screen shake enabled.
[208:18.34]But I will complain about it.
[208:20.44]Like a whiny little baby.
[208:21.88]Gold?
[208:45.28]How do you grab?
[208:47.38]What's a grab move?
[208:56.53]I don't really like the impact shake.
[208:59.93]No, and everyone's putting it in every game.
[209:08.29]Bulky bozos?
[209:11.67]What the fuck, dude?
[209:12.35]Batman didn't kill people.
[209:22.10]do the tutorial with that guy.
[209:32.55]Okay.
[209:51.36]Shit, I keep missing it.
[209:53.76]Hold on, ready?
[209:57.38]Swing.
[209:58.08]Turn the screen shake off, it's making my stomach hurt.
[210:25.77]It's making your stomach hurt.
[210:31.23]It's fucking with me too.
[210:33.64]Yeah.
[210:36.74]Who is responsible for this being in every game?
[210:44.64]Alright.
[210:46.88]Ladies and gentlemen.
[210:49.54]It's a 3.4.
[210:52.07]Pretty damn good.
[210:53.85]Pretty good.
[210:56.63]It's a 3.4.
[210:56.81]That's a 3.4.
[210:59.21]Next one.
[211:02.07]That was Midnight Fight Express, and that was a good one.
[211:04.79]That was a 3.4.
[211:06.71]Solid.
[211:07.89]I think that with a little bit more time in it, I'd probably make that score a little higher.
[211:13.05]3.4 is not a passing grade.
[211:13.75]Yes, it is.
[211:14.49]What are you talking about?
[211:15.05]Yes, it is.
[211:21.41]How is that not a passing grade?
[211:22.76]That's like a good score.
[211:26.90]Okay.
[211:28.36]Anything on this first drop down here that I don't want to skip?
[211:34.30]I'm telling you, potion permit is looking kind of pog to me.
[211:37.96]I think I want to do it.
[211:39.18]It's looking pretty good to me.
[211:43.80]One dev project?
[211:44.74]Okay, a one dev project makes that way better.
[211:50.40]That's actually insane.
[211:51.28]That's remarkable that's one person.
[211:54.02]I'm doing potion permit.
[211:54.90]I'm going for it.
[212:02.35]That's actually a crowning achievement for one person to do that.
[212:05.83]I just think I need a little bit more time in it.
[212:09.93]You know what I'm saying?
[212:13.18]Okay, let's do it.
[212:13.98]Potion, uh, potion power, whatever the game's called, I don't remember.
[212:20.20]Potion permit.
[212:23.02]I'm thinking this is going to be a mid, this is going to be a mid four.
[212:35.41]Get it over with already.
[212:36.51]What?
[212:36.93]This looks like a potential mid 4.2 game.
[212:41.63]Look at how cute this is.
[212:44.40]Hold on, I'm gonna turn it up.
[212:51.06]Guys, not every game has to have people getting punched in the face until their brains explode.
[212:54.86]You can do a potion game, okay?
[212:56.80]Listen to the music.
[213:00.32]Listen to the music.
[213:07.48]Attack, inventory, roll.
[213:09.70]Four buttons, perfect for me.
[213:12.15]Resolution, 720p.
[213:12.99]Let me change that real quick.
[213:26.39]Okay.
[213:32.32]Okay, let's go.
[213:34.30]Potion permit, let's do it.
[213:35.66]Let's go.
[213:38.68]Okay.
[213:39.92]Okay.
[213:40.42]Okay.
[213:44.74]Uh, okay.
[213:46.90]Uh, okay.
[213:49.67]Uh, green.
[213:50.33]Okay.
[213:52.13]And okay.
[213:54.21]And okay.
[213:56.69]And okay.
[214:00.16]This game has screen shake?
[214:01.38]No, it definitely doesn't.
[214:06.43]What a bad, worst fit I've ever seen.
[214:08.41]It was fine.
[214:27.01]Excuse me.
[214:28.57]Logan, it's me, Dr. Nestor from the Medical Association.
[214:33.47]Yes.
[214:35.00]I'm on my way to meet our colleagues on Moonbury Island.
[214:40.82]The Association HQ asked me to say hello to you since we're taking the same train.
[214:48.75]Oh my, I didn't realize you were bringing your dog along.
[214:52.11]Isn't he adorable?
[214:55.27]What's his name?
[215:02.35]I don't care, it's a demo.
[215:05.49]Such an adorable name.
[215:06.55]Are you going to help out on Logan's important assignment?
[215:10.63]Noggs000.
[215:15.84]We're almost at Moonberry's station.
[215:20.04]While you're on the island, you'll be representing the Medical Association.
[215:23.48]You have everything in order.
[215:28.83]This is a valuable opportunity for us.
[215:31.03]We're all counting on you.
[215:34.07]If you're successful, we may finally be allowed to establish a branch on the island.
[215:40.13]Camera shake.
[215:40.93]That's... We're in a train.
[215:43.55]I'm not swinging a sword and my whole head is shaking.
[215:46.43]We're on a train.
[215:47.35]It makes sense.
[215:47.87]It's fine if you're on a goddamn moving vehicle.
[215:50.91]Okay.
[215:51.63]Let's go.
[215:52.11]There's no screen shake.
[215:53.95]There's no screen... A camera shake is... I'm talking about impact screen shake when you swing a weapon or shoot somebody.
[216:09.42]This is it.
[216:10.16]Logan Moonbury Island.
[216:16.34]God, hurry up already!
[216:17.74]I just want to play the demo.
[216:19.40]I don't care shit about any of these people.
[216:32.98]Logan, we've been expecting you.
[216:35.32]Oh yes, allow me to welcome you to Moonbury.
[216:38.80]My name is Maya.
[216:40.00]I'm the mayor.
[216:41.71]This is my wife, Mario.
[216:48.49]Didn't I just skip?
[216:50.81]Didn't I hold the skip button?
[216:54.30]It's a two.
[216:56.14]I'm just kidding.
[217:01.82]We're missing such important shit here.
[217:05.88]Good evening, everyone.
[217:06.86]We've come together tonight to welcome a guest.
[217:11.93]Please allow me to introduce Logan.
[217:17.91]Logan is a chemist sent by the Medical Association.
[217:22.31]As you are all aware, our daughter has been sick for a long time.
[217:27.19]My wife and I are still trying to find a cure for her illness.
[217:31.51]The people are shaking.
[217:32.41]Stop it!
[217:39.23]With that in mind, we have sought assistance from the Capitol.
[217:45.19]How do you know that already?
[218:07.23]Hmm.
[218:07.79]Concerned.
[218:08.99]Nobody from the capital can be trusted.
[218:10.31]Have you forgotten what they did?
[218:13.01]Concerned.
[218:13.39]Oh, thinking.
[218:13.89]Concerned.
[218:14.33]Sad.
[218:14.73]Thinking.
[218:15.63]Hmm.
[218:16.63]Reserved.
[218:19.42]Now, now.
[218:19.98]Won't anyone make a newcomer feel welcome?
[218:23.94]Please forgive us.
[218:25.42]Everyone is just a little excited.
[218:30.02]Now, if you'd like to follow me, I'll show you to your lodgings.
[218:35.21]This game is probably like a four.
[218:37.74]wait till we get to the menu crafting menu this old building used to be our previous chemist house its former owner moved away a long time ago now that it's empty you can take it over I realize it might seem rather odd to you that not everyone here is overjoyed about yeah what's going on with that
[219:04.73]We've rather a history of incidents involving the medical association.
[219:09.49]Our relationship has been rather disastrous so far.
[219:13.70]I imagine they haven't told you a single word about all this in the capital.
[219:18.92]This is cute.
[219:19.32]I like this.
[219:20.10]You'll learn more about it as you discover the island.
[219:23.21]Let's come back to all this after you've rested, shall we?
[219:26.39]And please don't forget our request.
[219:27.43]Our daughter needs your help.
[219:32.20]I'll see you tomorrow, Logan.
[219:34.16]Good night, sleep well.
[219:39.69]Dude, what the fuck?
[219:40.25]Where's the instantaneous dopamine?
[219:58.31]You can move your character around freely while you're running.
[220:00.01]Your dog will follow you wherever you go.
[220:01.44]Sadly, he's not allowed to come inside the house.
[220:03.30]Why not?
[220:05.68]Interact with obstacles around you.
[220:07.00]You'll see a sign.
[220:07.66]I got a health bar.
[220:08.52]Okay.
[220:14.47]That was a pretty sick Minecraft sound.
[220:16.27]Okay.
[220:19.05]Okay.
[220:29.54]You can decorate your room.
[220:33.32]This game's so cute.
[220:34.02]It is so cute.
[220:35.78]Cool.
[220:36.44]You can acquire more furniture by purchasing them from the bulk and build.
[220:39.30]The music's really good, too.
[220:42.36]Very good.
[220:50.71]Triangle?
[220:54.55]Oh my god, this place is... Look at this.
[220:55.79]This is a dodge roll.
[221:04.11]Huh?
[221:07.17]Good morning.
[221:08.77]I trust you slept well.
[221:12.87]Excellent.
[221:13.17]Allow me to introduce Zhao, my assistant.
[221:17.19]This is Zhao.
[221:18.69]Very nice to meet you.
[221:21.49]I work with Mayor Meyer at the town hall.
[221:25.28]I was hoping the two of you would get along.
[221:29.02]If there's anything you need, Zhao will be able to assist you.
[221:33.52]As it is your first day, I'd like you to start and know our island.
[221:37.10]I've asked one of our rangers to meet you near Meadow Range and show you the ropes.
[221:41.40]To get there... The music!
[221:42.28]Listen to this!
[221:46.08]This is wonderful.
[221:46.80]Okay.
[221:56.18]Okay.
[222:02.57]Yeah, this is comfy.
[222:03.28]I like this.
[222:03.66]This is comfy.
[222:05.64]Highlighted quest.
[222:06.32]Go to the meadow range entrance.
[222:08.70]Minimap at the top right of the screen shows quest objectives as icons.
[222:12.80]You can apply chapstick liberally to your lips because you need it so bad.
[222:19.41]And... It's not here.
[222:21.87]Never mind.
[222:25.73]Okay.
[222:26.27]Go to the meadow range entrance.
[222:31.55]I mean, the art is beautiful.
[222:34.43]Music's really fantastic.
[222:35.79]Art is beautiful.
[222:36.99]Looks really nice.
[222:39.31]It's very clean.
[222:40.65]Very readable.
[222:41.29]All the font.
[222:41.85]I can see everything.
[222:44.38]Quest markers help.
[222:46.46]There's a dog.
[222:56.99]That's a big plus.
[222:57.73]You're right.
[223:02.45]I have a full map too.
[223:03.31]Ooh, okay.
[223:04.01]Look at this little town.
[223:09.00]Pet the dog?
[223:17.58]I don't think you can pet the dog.
[223:19.71]Maybe you can.
[223:25.77]Wait, this way.
[223:26.21]I like the cape.
[223:37.84]Uh oh.
[223:45.10]Hey there, you must be the chemist.
[223:49.47]My name's Forrest.
[223:51.79]Mayor Meyer said you'd be coming this way.
[223:54.39]I've got a little something for you.
[223:59.22]Call it a welcome gift.
[224:01.35]You might need it because I've got an errand for you.
[224:03.31]Here we go.
[224:04.39]I want you to gather some herbs.
[224:06.71]I'm sure you know how, right?
[224:09.49]Probably.
[224:09.83]That's not good.
[224:27.44]Oops me, my big mouth.
[224:29.62]Once you're done, head back to my cottage.
[224:30.70]I'll see you there.
[224:31.22]Alright.
[224:32.12]So I go get herbs?
[224:41.05]That's all.
[224:41.39]Alright, good luck.
[224:44.27]Swing your tools at gathering points to forge resources.
[224:46.49]Gathering points are indicated.
[224:47.47]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[224:49.25]Stamina is consumed.
[224:50.01]You can switch tools.
[224:52.77]Sickle, hammer, and axe.
[224:55.80]Dodge rolling does not consume stamina.
[225:00.55]Whoa.
[225:06.49]Hell yeah.
[225:13.18]What did you give it?
[225:13.70]A two?
[225:15.30]Wrong.
[225:16.67]Wrong.
[225:41.09]There ain't screen shake stuff.
[225:44.01]There is no screen shake.
[225:47.46]Stop it.
[225:54.82]Get Basil, get Daisy.
[225:56.10]Okay.
[226:05.71]Sticky Joe.
[226:06.45]How do I feed the dog?
[226:09.47]Dog interaction.
[226:12.25]Ah, okay.
[226:16.46]Your dog loves food.
[226:18.34]And loves to be petted.
[226:22.30]You can do this.
[226:23.00]Alright, that's cute.
[226:28.10]I wanted to... Wait, I wanted to open the dog menu.
[226:34.11]Apple juice?
[226:36.35]Why would you... I wouldn't feed my dog apple juice.
[226:40.13]But, okay.
[226:53.42]This is probably gonna be one of those really comfy Stardew Light games, isn't it?
[227:00.73]Just load it up, burn like eight hours in here just collecting goo.
[227:10.68]Oh shit.
[227:11.08]I can upgrade the tools?
[227:37.08]But it's, it's only, it's only on certain actions though.
[227:41.34]Can I get stumped too?
[228:05.75]Where are these things I'm supposed to be getting?
[228:07.91]Where's the jasmine and the basil?
[228:09.75]Is that supposed to be over here?
[228:30.81]Enemy?
[228:36.55]Spores.
[228:37.11]I need basil.
[228:38.45]Alright, I got plenty of rocks.
[228:45.22]I need basil and jasmine.
[228:47.00]Now.
[228:53.23]Am I going too far away?
[229:02.81]Oh!
[229:03.85]Is this?
[229:05.37]What is this?
[229:08.01]Jasmine.
[229:08.55]Yep.
[229:09.09]Got it.
[229:18.95]I like it.
[229:21.47]I like it.
[229:27.72]Now she's Basil.
[229:30.34]What the fuck is that?! !
[229:33.43]That's not a cute thing.
[229:34.63]That's a scary monster.
[229:59.57]Ooh, this one's got moss on it.
[230:00.51]I think it's worth more.
[230:09.14]Honey?
[230:10.07]No, copper nugget.
[230:10.75]Okay.
[230:19.90]I need three.
[230:20.84]I'm gonna do this task.
[230:26.88]Here, have some apple juice.
[230:39.30]Alright, I'm ready to give my demo assessment.
[230:42.90]You ready?
[230:44.96]Demo assessment, here it is.
[230:45.78]Are you ready for this?
[230:52.75]I think this is going to be a game that you spend a lot of time in.
[230:55.59]I feel like it's going to be really fun.
[230:57.93]I feel like it's very engaging.
[230:59.01]Tons of characters to care about.
[231:02.87]We got a day-night cycle.
[231:04.99]It's got a dodge roll.
[231:06.07]There's a lot to do, it looks like.
[231:07.57]There's a big town.
[231:13.74]There's a boat, which means there's probably another town.
[231:15.58]I think I'm gonna... I'm gonna be ballsy with this one.
[231:26.67]I think this is gonna be a... I think this is... I'm gonna be ballsy with this one. 3.6.
[231:46.60]That's very safe.
[231:47.50]That's not ballsy.
[231:48.26]That's very safe.
[231:51.22]I don't know.
[231:51.54]Okay, it's hard to give an assessment on this demo because it's a demo of a game that probably has like 100 plus hours of content in it.
[232:00.73]I'll tell you, from what's here, I think this is very, very nice.
[232:11.14]Southeast of the plants.
[232:12.88]What?
[232:13.08]What?
[232:13.48]Oh, you didn't see that?
[232:17.61]I got like a secret treasure map.
[232:27.28]Southeast?
[232:27.98]Where?
[232:28.34]A lot of bears.
[232:32.38]Oh, there it is.
[232:35.76]Oh god.
[232:47.86]You're only rating the demos?
[232:48.97]Oh, that's right.
[232:49.53]Okay, sorry.
[232:50.99]Alright, the game's probably going to be really fun.
[232:56.05]But I think the demo is... But how do you make a demo with a game this big?
[233:10.48]Basil is true north right now.
[233:11.96]I just got one right there.
[233:17.75]This with a- okay, let me paint you a picture here.
[233:20.01]This with a cup of coffee.
[233:21.97]Just shut up, listen to the music.
[233:24.23]And imagine you've got in your hand, you're just- you're at your computer, you're at your desk, you're in your room, whatever.
[233:28.56]Listen to the music.
[233:31.02]You got a hot coffee- coffee is right here.
[233:33.44]And it's burning hot.
[233:35.06]And you're just gonna- you're gonna hold it here, and you're just gonna smell it.
[233:37.50]You're not gonna take a sip.
[233:38.89]Then you're gonna put it down.
[233:40.35]And you're gonna do that like five or six more times until you take one sip.
[233:45.73]That's this kind of game.
[233:50.27]What's wrong?
[233:52.71]What's wrong with me?
[233:55.83]Did I not even complete the mission?
[233:56.89]Am I too tired?
[234:05.62]Stamina, right?
[234:06.40]Yeah, okay.
[234:08.64]Can I fail?
[234:12.40]Yeah, this is a brew a hot cup of coffee and sit here and smell the coffee while you play.
[234:18.08]And then take a sip every now and then.
[234:23.96]Like, I would just sit here and just do that like this.
[234:31.92]And then cast a fishing line.
[234:40.78]Lots of fails, lots of triumphs.
[234:47.23]No, we want to drink Mountain Dew.
[234:49.13]No, just have a nice cup of coffee.
[234:53.73]Coffee needs to be just raw.
[234:57.53]I like black coffee.
[235:07.78]I'm getting lost in the woods here.
[235:15.34]You get a nice hot cup of black coffee.
[235:17.38]Oh my goodness.
[235:21.01]This game's score went up because I thought about doing that.
[235:23.59]Without a doubt.
[235:29.66]This sound and this bridge, I can smell the coffee beans.
[235:32.84]And it's going to make it a 3.5.
[235:33.80]Alright, next.
[235:34.06]I failed the tutorial mission.
[235:43.54]Do you remember you're the worst reviewer?
[235:45.78]I can't review this game.
[235:47.56]I can't even review the demo.
[235:50.79]It's a huge game.
[235:52.19]It's very cute.
[235:53.37]The soundtrack is really, really wonderful.
[235:55.43]I like the art style.
[235:56.81]I think the characters are really interesting.
[235:58.73]I think the coffee smell is going to be up there.
[236:01.09]So I'm going to give it a 3.5.
[236:02.25]I think the demo is a solid 3.5 out of 5.
[236:06.74]I think that's good.
[236:15.09]Let's do one.
[236:15.63]You know what?
[236:15.91]Let's do, what, one or two more?
[236:16.97]I don't want to go too late.
[236:18.89]I just want to make sure I stream today.
[236:21.09]It was 3.6?
[236:22.07]Yeah, that's what it was.
[236:22.75]3.7.
[236:23.57]That's what the final score is.
[236:25.91]No, it's not.
[236:26.23]3.6.
[236:26.25]That's good.
[236:28.41]Rating demos is like the dumbest thing you could possibly do.
[236:32.35]I can't think of anything stupider than rating a demo.
[236:40.25]What about this game?
[236:42.38]What about this one?
[236:46.70]What do you think?
[236:50.18]Frozen... Escape Academy?
[236:53.40]Frozen Flame?
[236:54.62]This one looks okay.
[236:57.95]Terra Invicta?
[237:02.65]No.
[237:04.87]No.
[237:05.23]This looks way too... I don't play games like this.
[237:08.43]This is like Space Management Simulator.
[237:10.58]Nope.
[237:10.68]Nayyad?
[237:15.12]Nayyad?
[237:18.70]This looks kind of cool.
[237:22.50]Signals.
[237:24.20]This one apparently is violent.
[237:30.05]Kind of interested.
[237:31.83]We already saw this one, which was very nice.
[237:33.63]The Cultivation card game.
[237:38.67]A card game is going to be fun.
[237:43.34]Gloomwood?
[237:43.58]Gloomwood?
[237:54.43]This is the... Oh, man.
[237:57.16]Alright, we're saving this.
[237:57.96]Are we saving this one for tomorrow?
[237:59.36]Should I do this right now?
[238:03.36]Dude, this game is going to be insane.
[238:07.42]Should we do it right now or save it for tomorrow?
[238:12.02]I want to anticipate that one for one more day.
[238:14.08]Yeah, we'll do it tomorrow.
[238:15.80]Oh, my God.
[238:16.20]I'm so glad there's a demo for this game.
[238:17.42]I was so interested.
[238:18.18]I'm very curious about it.
[238:22.83]Rip out.
[238:23.19]Let's try this one.
[238:24.29]Let's go.
[238:24.71]Rip out.
[238:32.98]20 gigs for the demo?
[238:33.82]Holy shit.
[238:41.48]It's a violence game.
[238:44.99]Save this one for tomorrow?
[238:52.54]You think so?
[238:55.30]Okay, well, let's keep looking.
[239:01.84]Moonscars?
[239:05.90]Oh, it's kind of a 2D game.
[239:08.68]I kind of want to try this.
[239:11.89]Okay, I'm going to download Moonscars.
[239:16.09]Dome Keeper.
[239:17.45]Time Management.
[239:19.47]Action Roguelike.
[239:24.61]No, no, guys, guys, it's not, it's not, um... It's me downloading the game.
[239:34.54]No, no, we're good, we're good.
[239:36.08]It's okay.
[239:38.76]I'm downloading a 20 gig game, that's why it's doing this.
[239:41.39]We'll be okay, don't worry.
[239:47.39]It's done in, like, two seconds.
[239:52.55]Trey Pang 2...
[239:57.88]No, we're good, we're good.
[239:59.39]Limit the download?
[240:00.11]No, I want it instantly.
[240:01.85]It's done.
[240:04.37]Trey Pang 2... I kind of want to try Moonscars right now.
[240:08.17]That's what we're doing right now.
[240:22.60]Let's do it.
[240:29.14]Oh, I gotta exit this game.
[240:30.00]Okay.
[240:33.86]Don't just go through the popular ones.
[240:35.06]Explore the subcategories.
[240:36.55]No, I will.
[240:36.95]I will.
[240:40.95]There's a lot to go through, so don't worry.
[240:42.31]I'm not just gonna burn through just the popular ones.
[240:44.55]We'll go category by category.
[240:45.69]Alright, let's open it up.
[240:50.09]See how this one is.
[240:54.77]What the hell did I just download?
[240:58.33]What's that game called?
[240:59.57]What did I just download?
[241:05.77]Moonscars.
[241:06.25]Okay, yeah.
[241:11.79]Let's do it.
[241:18.02]Another humble game.
[241:21.38]I'm imagining this is probably a controller.
[241:23.64]Which it seems like it is.
[241:24.74]Alright, I'll...
[241:28.20]640 by 480.
[241:29.90]What are you on about here?
[241:31.00]I'm gonna turn it down.
[241:40.61]Keep it at 480p.
[241:45.47]That's a weird default.
[241:50.59]Oh my goodness.
[241:52.39]Oh my god.
[241:56.09]99 hertz that's not accurate that's not gonna be that's gonna be weird just play at 23 hertz wait why why would you do that you're out of sync what oh you gotta refresh you gotta refresh
[242:23.23]Sometimes with Twitch.
[242:25.05]Yeah.
[242:25.25]Alright, well I'm just gonna... I'm not doing 23 hertz.
[242:27.37]Does that work?
[242:36.26]You're not in sync?
[242:37.26]Ah, you gotta refresh.
[242:37.96]What just happened?
[242:46.73]What's going on?
[242:47.25]What happened?
[242:49.19]Oh, there you go.
[242:53.04]Let's do it.
[242:55.80]Things double as you, as you, what?
[242:59.18]I never come to purr on my knees these days.
[243:05.09]Does this guy like the painting?
[243:23.93]The game makes you really think about if you want to skip the cutscene.
[243:28.20]I felt bad halfway through, so I stopped skipping it.
[244:00.31]Oh, it's a cat.
[244:01.05]I thought there was a person sitting on the bench next to him.
[244:23.88]Already gets a bunch of points.
[244:25.31]I'll explain.
[244:31.01]Do you guys remember the game called Out of This World?
[244:33.92]Or Another World?
[244:36.00]I'm getting serious Another World vibes, which is a big plus.
[245:26.83]Healing.
[245:27.75]Ichor is a soul liquid, the very essence of human life.
[245:30.64]Use it collected to heal your wounds.
[245:46.84]You can't let it go.
[245:47.58]I can't let it go.
[245:49.14]I'm telling you, I'm not crazy.
[245:52.38]I'm not crazy.
[245:53.00]It's in every single game now.
[245:54.88]It just is.
[245:57.54]What resolution is this?
[245:59.16]What are you talking about?
[245:59.96]Why is it 640x480?
[246:05.38]Why is it 640x480?
[246:06.15]I don't think it is.
[246:06.67]That's bullshit.
[246:21.45]It was... I don't care.
[246:29.42]Ooh.
[246:33.68]Witchery.
[246:34.89]This game looks unbelievably fun.
[246:37.69]Hold on.
[246:38.19]Let me get over it.
[246:47.66]Yeah, it already was the highest resolution.
[246:52.15]I think it's just doing that for some reason.
[246:53.79]Alright, so I have witchery.
[247:01.25]God damn it.
[247:02.33]I'm so mad.
[247:03.34]Okay.
[247:11.86]So I have witchery now.
[247:13.80]Oh, direct blast forward.
[247:17.42]How do I do this?
[247:18.26]Ooh, that's cool.
[247:23.42]Can you open the door?
[247:32.37]This door opens from the other side.
[247:37.17]How do I get up there?
[247:52.98]Oh, okay.
[248:01.45]It's major screen shake.
[248:09.21]Um, how do I open this?
[248:11.47]Go left?
[248:24.07]I wasted my stuff.
[248:26.13]How do I get that back?
[248:32.79]Like that.
[248:36.43]Witchery spoils Icar.
[248:39.11]Irma can purge spoiled Icar hitting foes with her sword.
[248:41.49]Spoiled Icar can still be used for healing.
[248:43.21]Okay.
[248:58.23]I mean, it plays beautifully.
[249:01.49]It's... I mean, it plays wonderfully.
[249:03.69]It's smooth.
[249:04.53]The animations are great.
[249:05.83]The art style... It looks... The art style looks really nice.
[249:14.42]This is really... It's beautiful.
[249:27.71]Boss fights in this game I imagine will be the big selling point.
[249:35.32]Cool.
[249:38.02]Bone powder?
[249:46.17]Cool.
[249:47.03]250 bone powder.
[249:52.93]Climb the ledge.
[249:53.91]Oh, I'm in here now.
[249:54.71]Cool.
[249:56.22]Kind of like Castlevania... Kind of like... Kind of like... What's the other game I'm thinking of?
[250:15.66]Symphony of the Night.
[250:16.26]Yep.
[250:16.40]That's what I'm thinking of.
[250:22.96]Nice.
[250:29.62]It's fun.
[250:36.26]Am I dead?
[250:41.14]That's a good one.
[250:47.85]That's good.
[250:48.53]It's fun.
[250:49.85]I actually want you to look at this, though.
[250:50.95]This is important.
[250:51.79]Before it turns up.
[250:55.39]There's a lot of moves here.
[251:02.74]Look at all this.
[251:04.50]Corpse reassembly.
[251:05.56]There's an entire skill tree.
[251:06.89]Skill trees are a huge plus.
[251:09.91]There's a dev in the chat.
[251:14.83]This game's cool.
[251:18.93]Dev in chat.
[251:21.53]Rant about the screen shake real quick.
[251:27.12]No, I can't.
[251:27.92]I can't do that.
[251:28.96]I have stage fright.
[251:38.39]Stage fright!
[251:39.81]I'm like... Let me try one more time.
[251:53.41]That felt amazing.
[251:55.31]I'm telling you, this game is fun.
[251:58.23]When this comes out, there's going to be people that are playing the hell out of this.
[252:00.83]They're going to think it's an incredible game.
[252:02.28]It's going to be really difficult.
[252:03.82]It's going to be hard.
[252:04.54]The boss is going to be hard.
[252:06.34]The game is really, really about skill-based dodging and stuff.
[252:08.88]And it plays beautifully.
[252:10.06]Can you put a thing in where I can take the screen shake off the screen, please?
[252:18.84]I'm asking nicely.
[252:20.10]I don't want to be a weirdo about this.
[252:23.24]Guys, if we're gonna do this every dev... If every dev comes into the stream and every game has screen shake, I'm gonna look like a real dickhead.
[252:35.05]These games are great.
[252:36.15]This game is... I'm telling you, this game's fun.
[252:43.48]And look, I might be the weird one.
[252:45.46]You could probably poll 100 people, family feud style, and ask them, hey, do you give a shit if they screen shake on every hit?
[252:52.61]And if 99 of them say, no, I don't care at all.
[252:56.69]And I'm the weird guy that I get it.
[253:11.82]Shortcut, heal.
[253:15.28]Oh, that's right.
[253:15.72]I have the heal.
[253:16.82]Oh, actually, that's a pretty cool mechanic.
[253:18.56]It uses that.
[253:20.20]Cool.
[253:22.66]Shortcut.
[253:24.44]Ah, alright.
[253:24.98]Cool.
[253:27.62]Bone.
[253:28.80]Found a grave.
[253:29.48]Bone powder.
[253:29.88]I imagine that's probably how you level up.
[253:32.21]If you level up.
[253:51.49]Spite level achieved.
[253:52.45]Ooh, wait, there's bone powder.
[253:56.72]I never really thought about it.
[253:57.64]I know, and the thing is, I... It could've... This could've... Okay, don't... I'm gonna die.
[254:03.96]What are you doing?
[254:06.46]I feel like I'm just noticing it way more.
[254:12.13]And I am not speaking out of malice.
[254:14.12]I'm not speaking out of, oh my god, all these games stink.
[254:17.72]I'm speaking out of my actual physical well-being.
[254:21.02]It makes me actually nauseous.
[254:26.97]I'm not speaking out of malice, I promise you.
[254:29.31]It just makes me nauseous.
[254:46.19]Constantly shake so you can counteract screen shake.
[254:52.77]Are you getting nauseous right now?
[254:53.81]I mean, this one, I'll tell you, this one is not as bad as some... 3D games, it's a lot more painful for me to look at.
[255:06.43]I mean, it's still here, and I still don't love it.
[255:08.26]I don't like it really at all.
[255:10.28]But 2D versus a 3D visual with screen shake kind of hurts even more.
[255:15.52]You just played a heavy metal rhythm shooter.
[255:29.41]Yeah, but listen, listen.
[255:34.53]It's...
[255:40.74]You know what I'm saying?
[255:43.00]Okay.
[255:58.14]R?
[255:58.26]B?
[255:58.52]Oh, there's actually a parry?
[256:00.39]Cool.
[256:00.53]Let me try parry.
[256:11.89]that was cool alright I like that spike menu let's check it out instant heal build up effect critical oh critical definitely spell cost what about instant heal I feel like that's a good one I wait you doing a poll right now for screen shake
[256:39.85]How did only 500 people vote in that poll?
[256:42.71]There's 10,000 people here.
[256:45.65]Oh my god.
[256:46.71]So many of you do not give a shit about this at all.
[256:50.75]You don't care to even participate in the poll.
[256:53.88]You just don't even care.
[256:55.08]That's so funny.
[256:57.60]That's hilarious.
[256:59.14]A majority of you do not care at all.
[257:03.08]Have you been rolling your eyes the whole time?
[257:09.21]You just don't care.
[257:14.99]How many people voted on?
[257:16.61]How many people said to put it on?
[257:21.59]Not even a, like a 5% voting turnout?
[257:26.82]Oh my goodness.
[257:30.22]And somebody actually said, I don't even fucking care, laughing my ass off.
[257:37.98]I didn't even know there was a poll.
[257:39.46]You're not even watching my stream.
[257:41.98]You're not even watching the stream.
[257:47.52]God, I love this.
[257:48.46]I have so much fun.
[257:52.74]It's too fun.
[257:53.79]It's too fun to stream.
[257:54.91]It really is.
[257:57.47]Boss fight.
[257:59.03]I'm going to do wicked messy hair for the rest of the day.
[258:06.02]Okay.
[258:07.22]Ah, kind of like a hub world?
[258:14.01]Cool.
[258:20.07]Zoran, is that you?
[258:22.95]What happened to me, Zoran?
[258:25.58]I've been on the quest, Hedonite.
[258:26.48]Did something happen between us?
[258:28.74]My guts ache like I've been put in a grinder.
[258:32.27]You're meowing too loudly, kitten.
[258:34.51]It's not Zoran.
[258:35.55]It won't respond.
[258:37.49]A cleft husk has the same grim face as Zoran himself.
[258:40.46]You poor, poor kitten.
[258:41.52]I'm a cat?
[258:43.02]It may be still one of us.
[258:43.94]This husk can shape fine clay vessels for you.
[258:47.00]These strong bodies will help you slip from the clutches of pain, yet only for so long.
[258:51.85]Get a chance to heal your wounds, gray kitten.
[258:53.55]Just don't.
[258:53.89]I'm a cat?
[259:09.21]What is this?
[259:11.97]The cat is right.
[259:12.51]I lost a lot of ichor.
[259:14.61]I can't fight in full force with that gland shattered like that.
[259:18.78]I need to cast a mold.
[259:25.22]A new pole?
[259:25.78]No, you didn't participate in the first one.
[259:37.86]Look at how cool that looks.
[259:44.43]I love the animation.
[259:46.31]I love the art style.
[259:52.07]Let's do, I'm gonna do hammer.
[259:58.24]Okay.
[260:05.27]Very cool.
[260:06.91]How do I put the hammer on?
[260:10.35]I think it's already on.
[260:13.77]Cool.
[260:16.27]We're born orphans.
[260:19.48]So it doesn't take stamina or anything.
[260:28.22]Nice.
[260:32.10]10,000 people joined after the poll.
[260:33.42]I mean, we're very late.
[260:37.18]Wait, what?
[260:43.64]Weird.
[260:52.66]Screen shake aside, I think this game is actually... The demo is very fun.
[260:58.86]I think the game is... Okay, I think this is... I think this game is going to be good.
[261:03.81]I think it's going to be very good.
[261:12.36]land 3.7 if I could play without screen shake it's a four I genuinely think this game would be fun it is fun I'm just a fucking baby
[261:38.05]I'm not kidding.
[261:38.79]I genuinely think this is a really, really cool game.
[261:42.09]Genuinely.
[261:44.54]In fact, I'm gonna play it for another few minutes.
[261:55.39]If Morbius gets a re-release, we deserve another poll.
[261:58.99]I have nothing to do with Morbius.
[262:03.67]Why are you acting like I was on the team of people that made that movie?
[262:11.63]Nice.
[262:12.27]That was cool.
[262:16.14]Shit.
[262:32.95]Oh, I got another level up.
[262:47.78]Ooh, another shortcut.
[262:52.32]Morbius gets another re-reli- Just wait till they make Morbius 2.
[263:01.67]And they lean so heavily into all the memes.
[263:12.53]Look, they're gonna recast Jared Leto with Jay Leno.
[263:19.39]And they're gonna try to make it with makeup so you can't tell the difference.
[263:33.48]Shit!
[263:33.96]Alright, this game's fun.
[263:39.94]This is a lot of info.
[263:48.64]That's a 3.7, and if I could play it without screen shake, that's probably a 4.0.
[263:54.72]That game seems pretty great.
[263:57.50]I think the star of the show, so what do they give the feat game?
[264:01.00]Because I need to redo that.
[264:03.46]What do they give the feat game?
[264:06.93]That was a 5 out of 5.
[264:07.71]Yeah, okay, just making sure.
[264:09.49]Alright, let's do one more.

[270:44.31]What were you doing?
[270:46.95]Something interesting, probably.
[270:47.83]Atrioc always doing something interesting.
[270:50.93]I got ex-squeezed.

[270:58.90]That game is hard as shit.
[271:00.46]So, good luck with that one.
[271:04.42]Now, welcome, guys.
[271:05.96]We are doing something.
[271:07.00]We're going to do this tomorrow, too.
[271:12.84]We... Okay, hold on.
[271:15.12]We are doing Steam demos.
[271:16.70]If you go to Steam, you go to the store page.
[271:18.68]There's a shitload of coming soon games that aren't out yet that have demos.
[271:22.32]And it's a big event.
[271:23.36]And I'm telling you, it's cool.
[271:25.34]And you better check it out.
[271:26.24]Because it's only going to be here for like another week or so.
[271:28.98]So we're doing this tomorrow too.
[271:29.94]I'm going to pick random games on this list.
[271:31.30]And we're going to check them out.
[271:32.08]Check them out Thursdays.
[271:36.17]No, thanks.
[271:36.55]Thanks for the raid.
[271:36.95]Seriously.
[271:41.23]This one's called Nine Souls.
[271:46.27]There were hints of a tuber in there?
[271:47.65]Of course there was.
[271:49.03]There always is.
[271:55.94]What is with the pee your pants stuff?
[271:57.68]I mean, I did it like an hour ago.
[272:02.78]It's dried since then.
[272:03.56]I mean, the smell was a little much, but that got used to it over a while.
[272:23.30]Art's really good.
[272:24.80]And again, all you raiders, we're rating games out of five.
[272:28.30]The demos, we're rating the demos out of five.
[272:32.21]The art's... Oh, he smokes weed!
[272:33.65]Oh, this is definitely like a five.
[272:34.81]I'll give it a five right off the bat.
[272:38.97]Big bro.
[272:39.91]I smelled barbecue fish all the way back there.
[272:41.85]Oh, that fish does not look good at all.
[272:43.75]It's like there's nothing on it.
[272:49.27]I like the sound effect, though.
[272:51.92]Looks like you snagged a good haul of fish today.
[272:53.66]You're a true hunter.
[272:56.99]Forget that I'm cooking dinner today?
[272:58.39]You have to leave room for my carefully prepared delicacies.
[273:04.67]Cook as much as you like.
[273:05.51]I'll eat it all.
[273:07.21]Alright, you've been here for ages.
[273:08.23]You must finally be getting used to the food, huh?
[273:11.35]Okay.
[273:13.57]Follow me to the secret hideout.
[273:20.81]It's so beautiful.
[273:21.67]It's so pretty.
[273:28.25]Very much appreciate a demo.
[273:29.43]That just gets right to it.
[273:30.49]Right to the point.
[273:38.91]Go down.
[273:39.44]Yep.
[273:42.98]Jump higher.
[273:43.68]Cool.
[273:48.38]This game's gorgeous.
[273:49.82]What's this?
[273:50.30]Pick up?
[273:52.42]Dead man's notes.
[273:54.68]Okay.
[273:55.18]Is there a dash?
[274:01.04]Ooh.
[274:07.87]I am not seeing any of that thing we don't like.
[274:19.25]We're starting at five.
[274:26.57]It's only downhill from here, though.
[274:30.03]Okay, go get the crimson... Okay.
[274:37.53]So get up there and go get the... Alright, I gotta fight this pig.
[274:43.55]You guys are embarrassing us in front of new viewers.
[274:47.37]You're not embarrassing me, you're embarrassing yourself.
[275:00.89]It's auto.
[275:03.35]That looks like auto.
[275:10.41]Okay.
[275:15.58]Alright, I'll bring it back.
[275:19.42]Cool.
[275:20.92]Let's move.
[275:24.50]But yeah, the Steam demo thing is going on to the 20th, right?
[275:29.97]So there's still a little bit of time for you to check them out.
[275:34.85]Do I fight?
[275:40.53]I don't want to kill it.
[275:44.01]Can I just take it?
[275:48.80]I don't want to kill it.
[275:49.50]I guess I did.
[275:51.86]Okay.
[275:56.78]Crimson Hibiscus.
[276:01.71]No fall damage, good.
[276:07.08]Here's a flower.
[276:10.20]Let's go to the village.
[276:19.64]What the hell are you guys saying?
[276:21.93]You're making us look crazy.
[276:23.29]Why are you even writing this?
[276:28.14]Market is really bustling today.
[276:29.32]It was obviously a good harvest.
[276:30.74]Everyone's brought their surplus grains to trade before the ceremony starts.
[276:36.78]That's all we do.
[276:37.69]Yeah, you guys have a tendency to be a little weird.
[276:42.13]I did just say I pissed my pants and it smelled bad.
[276:44.49]So I'm at fault too, but it's not as weird as pooping your pants.
[276:50.75]Okay.
[276:54.19]Don't, I don't, just don't let me influence you, okay?
[277:07.01]We're weird?
[277:07.51]Yeah, you are kind of weird.
[277:08.63]Look at what you're writing.
[277:09.63]Everyone's telling me to shit my pants on camera.
[277:12.53]It's like 60% of the chat.
[277:16.07]That's a little strange, don't you think?
[277:23.89]Cool.
[277:33.27]Just ban the word poo-poo.
[277:36.81]Okay, cool.
[277:41.24]What the hell?
[277:47.80]Okay.
[277:51.67]I knew I heard it.
[278:01.11]Everything looks so pretty.
[278:03.78]Only God knows.
[278:04.14]Mm-hmm.
[278:04.34]Mm-hmm.
[278:40.19]I'm not, I'm not fecal funny.
[278:42.59]It's you guys.
[278:42.99]That tasted like ass.
[278:53.44]I've just been sitting here all day and I just like drank whatever was at the bottom of it.
[278:58.28]That tasted awful.
[279:04.50]We gotta get to the gameplay.
[279:05.36]I need to say, I gotta give you my assessment.
[279:16.15]Don't ask him that.
[279:17.03]Okay, day of the ceremony.
[279:24.18]Incoming signal.
[279:24.94]What do you mean, signal?
[279:27.08]Yee, it's me.
[279:28.24]Your wounds must have pretty much healed by now.
[279:30.42]I just want to remind you that the time has come.
[279:33.16]The passageway only opens again in half a year.
[279:35.12]If you miss it this time, you'll be in dire straits.
[279:38.45]Make a move already.
[279:39.07]Those animals have kept you long enough.
[279:40.49]Remember, be discreet.
[279:42.01]Don't let yourself be seen.
[279:53.78]What were you doing sneaking about just now?
[279:56.69]I was just talking to myself.
[279:59.09]Save it.
[279:59.57]I knew there was something fishy about you.
[280:01.23]Don't think you can fool me just because you wear that bamboo hat of yours.
[280:04.83]A Paradise in the sky?
[280:05.83]Gods?
[280:06.15]I don't know who made up that hogwash, but I know it's odd.
[280:09.94]Laugh all you want.
[280:10.70]You wait and say I'll prove it to these morons.
[280:22.17]Wow, firecrackers.
[280:23.97]Okay.
[280:49.06]That's a bit of a harsh pull, not gonna lie.
[280:53.26]Why?
[280:53.48]Is it bad?
[280:53.96]I can't see it.
[280:59.02]Is it bad?
[281:05.15]55%.
[281:15.44]Yikes.
[281:19.88]So what am I doing here?
[281:22.09]I probably shouldn't have skipped all the dialog in the room.
[281:28.29]Okay.
[281:34.27]I respect the flying throne.
[281:42.57]What's going on here?
[281:44.21]I'm not going to sacrifice this guy, right?
[281:59.59]What the fuck?
[282:09.03]Wait, what?
[282:09.81]We're doing... Oh no, that's not good.
[282:24.51]What the fuck?
[282:29.95]The ceremony is sacrifices.
[282:35.03]Alright, this is crazy Big bro, thank you for taking care of me for the past two years.
[282:46.40]I'm going now Oh
[283:00.55]Attach?
[283:01.49]Foo charm.
[283:20.30]Please spare us from your wrath, oh gods.
[283:24.09]Big bro, what's going on?
[283:25.19]Alright, I'm way more interested.
[283:26.37]I should not have skipped everything.
[283:27.31]That was my mistake.
[283:29.76]This just got really, really interesting.
[283:31.76]And I skipped... God damn it, I skipped the movie.
[283:36.48]I'm not your big bro.
[283:37.96]What do you mean?
[283:38.42]Who are you if not my big bro?
[283:39.62]Who exactly are you?
[283:43.42]I said, what's the dog doing?
[283:45.55]What just happened?
[283:46.19]Why did you do that?
[283:46.85]Where are you going?
[283:50.35]I'm gonna put the helmet on?
[284:06.75]What's the... What the fuck?
[284:09.39]Human body treatment field.
[284:10.59]Alright, let's go.
[284:18.23]Deflect.
[284:20.27]Nice.
[284:21.83]Press to attach food charm on an enemy.
[284:23.93]Ooh.
[284:25.17]Detonate.
[284:28.17]What?
[284:31.55]What's wrong with me?
[284:32.67]Uh-oh.
[284:38.39]Oh, you fucking smoke weed, kid.
[284:39.53]Fucking heal up.
[284:45.21]What is this?
[284:51.44]Rest?
[284:53.20]So this is like a Dark Souls game.
[284:58.68]Oh, that hurt.
[284:59.18]Okay, hold on.
[285:08.16]Nice.
[285:09.68]4.7.
[285:09.76]It went down.
[285:10.62]Alright, there was a dash.
[285:15.00]4.8 went up.
[285:15.56]I didn't think there was a dash.
[285:17.09]It went up.
[285:18.27]Back to 4.8.
[285:18.65]What is this?
[285:31.75]Blood-soaked cr- Oh, this is their bodies!
[285:34.49]This is their- Oh, okay.
[285:36.26]That's what they- They turn into, like, this mush?
[285:54.54]Wait, I can run up the wall, right?
[285:55.92]Yep.
[286:08.85]What is going on here?
[286:09.93]Oh!
[286:20.74]To the guy in chat that said I was never going to use charms...
[286:25.49]You just got timed out for two minutes.
[287:00.31]Ow!
[287:00.47]4.6 4.5
[287:41.24]Okay, if I get all three of these guys in one Charm Explosion, it's a 4.6.
[287:52.63]Excuse me?
[287:54.15]What the hell was that?
[287:55.51]Alright, 4.3.
[288:12.89]I landed.
[288:13.65]That wasn't a skill issue.
[288:14.35]I didn't know I didn't get an instant kill.
[288:19.87]This is creepy though.
[288:20.59]This is actually really weird.
[288:30.76]How many charms can I use?
[288:31.82]Do I have a finite amount?
[288:35.92]This is weird.
[288:39.48]Origin of Ape Man?
[288:40.62]Alright, I actually want to know.
[288:51.46]Okay, how do I read it?
[289:04.47]Morning, morning.
[289:05.43]Perimeter breached by living organism.
[289:06.85]Morning.
[289:10.72]Shut it down.
[289:17.34]It's all happening.
[289:18.69]With that stunt of yours, it looks like new Penglai will be abuzz with commotion for a while.
[289:25.11]Eve, why'd you strike that early?
[289:26.19]It wasn't part of the plan.
[289:27.37]Was it to save that human child?
[289:29.18]If you always break with protocol, it's going to be really tough to execute our plan.
[289:33.82]This music is wild.
[290:02.18]Am I gonna get a boss fight before the demo ends?
[290:03.78]Nice.
[290:03.88]Alright, so you get three heals.
[290:22.85]I'm getting some kind of currency, too, in the top right.
[290:31.48]Uh-oh, it's a checkpoint.
[290:32.59]You set up an intrusion alarm.
[290:33.77]To unlock the gate, you have to take out the guards.
[290:36.92]Let's do it.
[291:00.91]That wasn't too bad.
[291:03.10]Say the line again?
[291:04.10]What?
[291:14.52]That's good.
[291:16.61]When does this game come out?
[291:19.35]Fuck, that hurt.
[291:34.18]Quarter two, 2023.
[291:35.50]Damn, that's far away.
[291:36.62]That's far away.
[291:41.40]That's in a whole year.
[291:42.24]That's really good.
[291:56.13]It's in good shape for that release.
[291:58.77]Yeah, I mean, it feels that way.
[292:15.01]Hell yeah.
[292:17.17]Getting the hang of it.
[292:22.12]I thought I went down.
[292:32.03]I guess not.
[292:44.43]Shit!
[292:45.21]He was in the wall, I couldn't see.
[292:51.30]What do you do with the money, though?
[293:00.95]Chest up there, I wanna...
[293:11.80]It does kind of feel like Sekiro.
[293:15.80]With the parry, parry, parry, parry.
[293:17.62]Ooh, skill tree.
[293:23.62]Max energy.
[293:27.08]This one.
[293:29.34]Chi explosions are from the charms, right?
[293:40.39]Okay.
[293:59.42]I'm very hungry.
[294:00.16]Oh my god, I haven't eaten all day.
[294:01.38]I have not eaten a single piece of food.
[294:04.06]Holy shit, that's bad.
[294:07.55]No, that's not true.
[294:08.29]In between when the stream turned off, I had a sandwich.
[294:16.21]Pizza is going to be out of the question now.
[294:19.20]I don't think I can get pizza at midnight.
[294:30.00]No, I had a sandwich at 6.30 or so, 6 o'clock when the stream went down the first time.
[294:36.47]No, I forgot that I ate.
[294:37.33]I'm good.
[294:43.39]Oh, don't.
[294:47.91]I was right there at the end.
[294:49.54]Shit.
[294:50.04]Alright.
[294:57.94]Okay, hold on.
[295:01.79]Alright, please somebody write this down, because I don't remember, but I want to remember this game when it comes out a year from now.
[295:11.77]Yep.
[295:12.93]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[295:15.51]Alright.
[295:18.93]Wishlisted?
[295:19.49]Yeah, I know, dude, but I have on my wishlist, um...
[295:24.34]Cry of Fear is still on my wishlist.
[295:27.50]I think I put it on there back in, like, 2010.
[295:29.50]I just don't even look.
[295:34.27]I literally don't even look at it.
[295:35.19]Alright, I get it, I get it.
[295:40.79]This is a... I'm very happy with the games we played today, because all of them have been good.
[295:46.52]They've all been actually really good.
[295:48.88]I've not... We've not seen... Out of the seven or eight games we've played, none of them have been bad.
[295:54.74]You know what?
[295:56.14]That's really encouraging.
[295:58.86]I talked a lot of shit about Diablo Immortal earlier.
[296:02.43]But... People are still making games, man.
[296:05.33]They are.
[296:11.47]It's easy to forget sometimes.
[296:18.06]They're all on the featured list?
[296:23.89]Aren't these indie?
[296:24.49]Yeah, well, that's what I mean.
[296:25.27]Like... Every time that I play a AAA game, I always kind of... With some exceptions, obviously, right?
[296:33.17]I come away with it going... Eh.
[296:39.06]Eh, like... Whatever.
[296:39.92]I just don't care.
[296:40.80]I'm trying to think.
[296:46.16]What were some AAA games that had come out the last year or two that I really actually liked?
[296:49.07]I think Elden Ring...
[296:54.24]It's a great out, because it's already at the top.
[297:01.69]Oh, you accumulate Chi that way.
[297:03.09]I get it.
[297:12.93]Yeah.
[297:13.11]I don't know why it's teaching me this now.
[297:16.55]Yeah, Elden Ring, but before Elden Ring.
[297:19.01]What else did I like?
[297:20.97]Resident Evil 8 was alright.
[297:21.95]Yeah, it was.
[297:25.38]AAA games are super expensive.
[297:26.64]Companies hate to risk with their money, so most of them are just kind of generic.
[297:32.36]Yeah, but I mean, AAA games 5, 10 plus years ago weren't like that.
[297:41.20]I don't think that's necessarily correct.
[297:48.97]Don't BatChest me.
[297:50.17]Don't BatChest me.
[297:51.31]Don't BatChest me.
[297:55.08]Did I just die?
[297:55.60]Oh.
[297:58.40]They were way lower budget before.
[298:02.13]Times have changed in the last five to ten years.
[298:04.23]Yeah.
[298:11.27]I think that we just saw so many just world-defining video games back in like the mid-2000s.
[298:19.49]It's easy to forget that there's other games that have come out.
[298:25.82]2017 was five years ago.
[298:27.32]Don't even say that.
[298:28.58]Jesus.
[298:36.54]World.
[298:37.18]Oh my god.
[298:37.82]World defining stuff.
[298:45.04]Compared to movies, the money used for video games is lower.
[298:47.44]Yeah.
[298:51.27]Just take screen shake out of your game.
[298:57.44]I think that's it.
[298:59.22]We'll be live tomorrow.
[299:01.02]I'm going to try to start somewhere like, yeah, around 4 o'clock tomorrow.
[299:04.82]This time actually starting at 4 and not leaving in an hour because the internet is fucked up.
[299:13.16]You kind of dried up the featured section.
[299:14.58]Yeah, we'll go category by category and just kind of scroll through.
[299:16.72]I'm not going to play this succubus game, no.
[299:24.64]But that's it.
[299:25.10]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[299:26.84]Have a good one.
[299:27.34]Thanks for watching.
[299:27.96]Thanks for participating in the stream.
[299:32.22]I have to apologize because if you weren't here earlier, I was having Twitch server problems again.
[299:40.99]And it really kind of blew up the whole stream.
[299:47.07]I kind of took a break for two hours and came back.
[299:51.01]I'm glad it ended up working.
[299:51.79]I'm glad I actually got a server that actually works.
[299:54.82]So, thanks for watching.
[299:55.90]See you tomorrow, same time, 4pm.
[299:57.84]We're going to do this again.
[300:02.76]No game on that feature list was under a 3.5 out of 5.
[300:06.82]They were all solid games.
[300:10.80]Which excites me.
[300:14.44]Alright, goodnight guys.
[300:15.48]See you later.
[300:16.54]Oh, we got a minute still.
[300:17.22]We got like 2 minutes.
[300:20.84]Oh, the credits are all up.
[300:28.79]Happy birthday to... Please say happy birthday.
[300:35.53]Hey, Star Lapel.
[300:36.93]Happy birthday.
[300:41.59]What's the worst game that you played today?
[300:45.36]I don't think there is a worst game.
[300:53.50]Baseball.
[300:54.04]Yeah, I said it in the beginning of the stream, but I'll say it again.
[300:55.90]Baseball is moving...
[300:58.79]From July 14th to July 20th.
[301:02.71]We had to make a last minute change.
[301:08.33]The Jerma Baseball Association will be on July 20th.
[301:21.80]Diablo Immortal.
[301:25.41]I think all of them sat at a base level of good.
[301:28.55]The best one was definitely the feed game.
[301:33.65]Angry Foot, whatever it was called.
[301:38.63]Green screen update.
[301:39.63]We are almost done vetting the actions.
[301:45.76]I will give you a date that I'm going in front of the screen in the next week, I'd say.
[301:56.24]Yeah, that game was unbelievably fun.
[302:01.03]There was a team name change.
[302:02.65]Yeah, but that's not why we had to push the event by a week.
[302:09.77]There was some stuff with the venue that we just had to move it.
[302:12.98]We couldn't do it on that date.
[302:15.68]There was some stuff that the venue had to change.
[302:20.92]Your team names are the California Clowns versus the Maryland Magicians.
[302:28.05]That's one I wouldn't miss.
[302:29.75]July 20th.
[302:30.09]It's going to be an exhibition game.
[302:33.61]Probably right in the middle of the season because I feel like that's a good place to do it.
[302:44.62]Where do the names come from?
[302:46.36]Well, I'll tell you.
[302:47.50]It's called Random Name of State.
[302:50.68]That's it.
[302:52.68]Does it roll?
[302:53.94]What do you mean?
[302:54.38]What do you mean when I get it from?
[302:55.84]This is a baseball league that's been operating for a long time.
[302:58.87]What do you mean?
[302:59.45]Where did the names come from?
[303:01.23]I don't know.
[303:01.77]I didn't pick the names.
[303:02.53]Why are you asking me that question?
[303:08.57]I mean, I am, you know, commissioner, owner, and operator of the entire league.
[303:13.67]But, I mean, there's various reasons why you'd have certain cities and certain states.
[303:22.46]July 20th.
[303:23.42]Don't forget.
[303:23.82]The baseball mogul doesn't know his own teams.
[303:38.98]Yeah.
[303:53.67]I do apologize again for the... I mean, I streamed for like two hours earlier.
[303:59.94]And it was just frame drops, Steam maintenance.
[304:03.26]It just didn't go well.
[304:07.52]Let's get back in the saddle tomorrow.
[304:12.35]Yeah, and Atriok.
[304:13.17]Thanks for the raid, Atriok.
[304:14.59]If some of you Atriok fans are here.
[304:18.91]He is a stand-up dude.
[304:21.51]I highly recommend you go follow Atrioc if you don't already.
[304:24.55]I don't know what you're doing with your life.
[304:28.09]But that needs to be corrected immediately.
[304:33.11]Very, very cool dude.
[304:33.83]Yeah, see you tomorrow.
[304:40.30]Good night, guys.
[305:19.35]Oh.
[305:54.20]you
