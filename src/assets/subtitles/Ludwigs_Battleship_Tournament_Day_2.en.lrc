[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.41]Did you hear the exciting news?
[00:01.93]What's the news?
[00:02.61]I'm in Bella Porch's new music video.
[00:05.62]Uh, oh, I actually knew that.
[00:08.84]How?
[00:10.24]Uh, you know how.
[00:12.28]Do I?
[00:13.28]Maybe.
[00:13.76]I could tell you how I know, but I didn't know.
[00:16.06]Wait, how did you know?
[00:17.32]Tell me in vague terms.
[00:19.15]I will tell you in vague... How could I tell you in vague terms that I knew you were in Bella Porch's new music video?
[00:26.69]What is the best vague way to do it?
[00:29.81]Let's just say everything in the world runs through stands.
[00:32.05]How about that?
[00:34.87]That's actually terrifying to hear, but fair enough.
[00:39.06]Yeah, there you go.
[00:40.02]Charlie, Jerma, what's up?
[00:41.86]Hey.
[00:43.13]going on well congrats on the music video debut uh thank you thank you very much you know I'm trying to work my way towards my imdb page following in the footsteps of the greats I'm a fake fan what's your your music video I I did a uh you know uh bella porch do you know bella do you know who bella porch is Jerma I don't I don't should I
[01:06.65]No, honestly, you shouldn't.
[01:10.60]I'm like 36.
[01:11.92]You would be the last person.
[01:13.78]She's like, I think she's, you could pretty safely say, one of the biggest TikTokers.
[01:19.20]And transitioned into doing music.
[01:21.00]And her last song, banged.
[01:24.04]I don't listen to very much music at all.
[01:26.02]This one's even better because Ludwig's in it.
[01:28.20]Sykuno!
[01:29.20]Let's go, Ludwig.
[01:30.28]You're in the music video.
[01:31.58]What are you doing?
[01:32.32]He made the music video.
[01:33.44]Well, it's a pretty big role.
[01:35.75]I'm bellboy number two.
[01:37.03]Bellboy?
[01:41.21]Bellboy number two, yeah.
[01:42.69]It's a speaking role.
[01:43.97]Speaking role, that's... Yeah, that's pretty... What do you say?
[01:47.61]Wait, what?
[01:47.99]You're speaking during the song?
[01:49.50]Wait, so you're also in the song itself?
[01:52.02]Amazing.
[01:52.56]Well, before the song actually starts, um, and- Wait, you got Pee Wee Herman?
[01:56.68]You were Pee Wee Herman in the movie, and then you were Pee Wee Herman the bell- You don't want to say you got Pee Wee Herman.
[02:03.54]You don't want to look up Pee Wee Herman.
[02:05.08]You got arrested for masturbating in a movie theater?
[02:07.14]Alright, alright.
[02:09.00]Okay, alright, gentlemen.
[02:10.84]Uh, very much appreciate you guys showing up here.
[02:13.54]Um...
[02:14.18]Again, enough about my accomplishments because you guys got a pretty big bracket in front of you today.
[02:21.35]Now, there's one thing I can guarantee you.
[02:23.05]This won't go more than two hours.
[02:25.23]You said that the last time.
[02:26.39]Because it's going to start best of one.
[02:28.71]Alright.
[02:29.19]We have two semifinals matches to start off.
[02:31.61]It's going to be Sykuno versus Charlie.
[02:33.75]And then right after that, it's going to be Stans versus Jerma.
[02:36.44]Those are both going to be best of one matches.
[02:40.52]I got to clear my throat.
[02:41.92]I don't want to be disgusting on your stream.
[02:43.34]Hold on.
[02:43.88]It's okay.
[02:44.50]I already am that every time, so you really can't.
[02:47.46]Do you guys, are you guys multi-boxing it side by side?
[02:49.62]What's the metaphor?
[02:50.66]I just, I tab.
[02:52.26]I'm a simple tabber.
[02:53.66]You're a simple tabber.
[02:54.74]I got two windows right next to each other open in theory.
[02:57.33]Okay, that's what I had, but my face was covering it a little too much.
[03:00.53]Maybe to be the webcam.
[03:01.47]The difference is Jerma is not live.
[03:05.95]So his face doesn't matter.
[03:10.67]The location of his face doesn't matter.
[03:12.42]I'm sorry, his face doesn't matter?
[03:14.20]It was hard to say, but... No, everyone knows what you mean.
[03:17.62]My face doesn't matter in this exact context.
[03:19.98]You gotta correct exactly.
[03:20.97]Yes, exactly.
[03:22.59]I'm just thinking really hard about where to put them is all.
[03:25.32]Oh, I'm looking at the wrong stream.
[03:26.22]I'm looking at Ludwig's stream and Sykkuno's stream and they're the exact same because Ludwig is watching Sykkuno.
[03:30.06]I thought they were putting their boats in the same exact spot.
[03:33.30]I did that for like 40 minutes last time.
[03:36.81]It was not good.
[03:37.95]Everybody in my chat was saying that I've never won a first game.
[03:41.35]So this is gonna be tough.
[03:42.97]This is tough.
[03:43.83]Is that a stat?
[03:44.57]I gotta be ready.
[03:45.29]You've never won a first game.
[03:47.27]They're keeping like ERAs and wins and losses for everybody.
[03:50.86]Yeah, like it's a tennis tournament.
[03:53.04]Yeah, but somehow I don't even know how.
[03:54.56]They have the amount of times I've walked.
[03:55.74]I don't even know how that makes any fucking sense.
[03:57.16]Have you guys opened up Charlie's stream?
[03:59.60]Yeah, I'm on Charlie's stream right now.
[04:00.84]Are you noticing what I'm noticing?
[04:02.82]No.
[04:03.40]He's wearing a black t-shirt.
[04:06.37]Oh!
[04:06.67]If you're unfamiliar with Charles White Lore, he wears a white t-shirt every day of the year except his birthday.
[04:12.31]This is kind of a rare occasion.
[04:14.71]No, it was his birthday four days ago.
[04:16.33]Three days ago or something.
[04:17.65]Yeah, somewhere around there.
[04:19.45]So this is dicey.
[04:20.62]I'm not...
[04:21.96]I'm nervous for Sykuno.
[04:23.76]Sykuno's kind of like you, Stanz.
[04:25.62]You're a scanning Samuel.
[04:28.04]I did in game one, but I changed my tune.
[04:30.38]Game three, me and Northernlion both used only mines, and we spammed mines on the board.
[04:35.24]It's kind of funny because different players, you can tell they're strats, but I could never tell you what Jerma strat is.
[04:44.00]Do you think you have one?
[04:46.54]Yeah, you want to say it out loud?
[04:47.61]Like where you're going to put your ships?
[04:49.07]Sure.
[04:50.63]No, don't.
[04:51.35]You're going to mentally blend me.
[04:52.81]Please don't.
[04:53.61]Okay.
[04:54.43]Alright.
[04:55.09]I can tell you if I want.
[04:55.85]I'll tell you exactly where they're going to go.
[04:58.27]I'm going to tell you exactly where my two ships are going to go.
[05:00.91]I don't want to know.
[05:01.63]I'm going to mute.
[05:02.17]I have to.
[05:02.51]You can't do this to me.
[05:04.29]Wait, how does he already have enough points for the archers?
[05:08.50]I guess it's like three rounds have already passed you get two points per round.
[05:11.96]They just been archery six, isn't it?
[05:14.20]Archers are eight to three by three
[05:28.27]Wait, where is this single chungus?
[05:29.83]Yeah, that's the... Where did he get all the points?
[05:31.33]Oh, man.
[05:31.57]Alright, guys, we got him to waste a shot.
[05:33.07]They're just literally speeding through these rounds.
[05:35.15]This is a speed run.
[05:36.17]Totally missed the top right, though.
[05:39.07]That's not good.
[05:39.61]Yeah, it feels bad.
[05:40.89]I got, like, so close.
[05:41.85]I got, like, a strongly worded letter from every contestant on the amount of time it took, so I think they're trying to rush through as quickly as possible today.
[05:50.56]I remember just the last time, just sitting there.
[05:52.62]I think it was, I think it was Charlie came in and he's just like, yeah, we're just kind of, what's going on?
[05:57.08]Are we like continuing to play?
[05:58.24]I got to go.
[05:59.50]Yeah.
[06:00.52]Anytime you hear, anytime you hear something like another streamer during an event, say like, I got to go.
[06:04.76]It's like, oh fuck, this is, we're doing this.
[06:07.79]This is too long.
[06:08.79]yeah it's too long like you gotta go you gotta go oh no I told Chad I was like this time best of one and everyone was mad I was like trust me I'm more happy that you guys are mad at me than all these things that are your friends and others yeah what's my I gotta think of what my strategy is gonna be for you oh I think I'm just gonna not spend any points at all until like until like 10 rounds go by and I'm gonna just drop like five or six bombs on you
[06:34.12]I think that's a good idea.
[06:35.50]Well, so you know that you can only do one per turn.
[06:39.58]Okay.
[06:40.02]That's good to know.
[06:40.64]But I would do that every turn, though.
[06:41.83]If you had enough points to do two archers, you could still only do one.
[06:46.19]Yeah, but then the next turn there's another archer coming, you know?
[06:48.81]Yeah, that's true.
[06:50.40]You could do like I would be more fearing it because there I know there's more archers coming You can do a shot a mine a scan a two by two and your special.
[06:59.36]Yeah, you just can't repeat Yeah, so I've only ever used the Archer with the three by three, but I also got like air rated on What did you play Ludwig?
[07:08.77]Although you lost.
[07:09.37]What did you play Jerma?
[07:10.71]Okay, I played the What's his name there?
[07:14.32]William Carslake?
[07:16.22]Giuseppe.
[07:17.34]Oh, you did play Giuseppe.
[07:19.10]What is Giuseppe's power?
[07:20.44]He has a torpedo.
[07:22.00]The torpedo that stops when it hits something and not the full line?
[07:24.58]No, no.
[07:25.16]It's a 3x3.
[07:26.76]Oh, it's a 3x3 area of your choice.
[07:28.97]Oh, it's the 10 point.
[07:30.31]It's like the archers, but it doesn't miss.
[07:32.41]Oh, it literally just doesn't leave that one.
[07:33.89]Yeah, he don't miss.
[07:35.47]I like his placement too.
[07:37.05]I mean, I have one down, but you have... But the one you're thinking of is William Carslake.
[07:41.53]That's what Sykuno plays.
[07:44.54]oh so he's playing um he's playing it right now right on the nose oh but he's used all of his he's used a lot of scans instead of torpedoes he probably has a torpedo locked he usually likes a torpedo the entire second row or column because it clears out column one usually right unless they go verti on column one yeah yeah I mean he's got everything except for this top left here it is again there's a day one there's again he's saying day one
[08:11.14]Oh, sorry.
[08:11.84]Is that a no?
[08:13.34]Jerma didn't know that.
[08:14.76]He didn't know the phrase day one?
[08:17.04]No.
[08:17.89]Oh, day one.
[08:18.51]I don't know who like TikTok people are.
[08:20.51]I don't know what day one is.
[08:24.81]Rap music in 2004?
[08:27.34]I've got like a full like loaf of bread on both of you guys probably, don't I?
[08:34.74]I've got a full loaf of bread, I think, on both of you.
[08:37.19]Is that a dirty dozen?
[08:39.55]How many slices of bread are in a loaf of bread?
[08:42.93]I don't know.
[08:43.35]Wait, is it static?
[08:46.21]Yeah.
[08:47.01]What if it's like a juicy loaf?
[08:48.88]Yeah, I think I am 10 years older than both of you.
[08:52.30]No way.
[08:52.74]No shot.
[08:53.74]There's no shot.
[08:54.58]I'm old.
[08:54.88]I'm just cool.
[08:55.64]Stance is old.
[08:57.08]Oh, are you sure I'm not a full loaf of bread?
[08:59.05]I mean, if you're 39 years old, then I'll take it all back.
[09:02.81]Okay, well, I'm 36 this year.
[09:04.69]Okay, yeah, see?
[09:05.41]Not even close.
[09:06.01]It's just seven.
[09:06.63]That's three quarters of a loaf of bread.
[09:08.79]Although, you take off the two gross pieces, right?
[09:10.80]And you throw them away.
[09:11.70]Yeah.
[09:12.24]Wait, are you calling the crust pieces gross?
[09:14.32]No, I'm actually making fun of the people that say that because why don't you eat the bread?
[09:17.76]Yeah, I eat it.
[09:18.34]I eat the crust.
[09:19.02]My wife refuses to.
[09:19.96]They're good bread.
[09:20.62]Why?
[09:20.80]It's bread.
[09:21.30]I don't get that.
[09:22.64]I've had arguments for like an hour with friends about like why you'd not eat.
[09:25.78]It's a piece of bread.
[09:26.54]It just has crust on it.
[09:28.57]It's just slightly harder.
[09:30.47]Ludwig, I'm full.
[09:31.85]I think I have it on you.
[09:33.49]I'm 26.
[09:33.71]Are you 36?
[09:34.21]Both archers have completely whiffed.
[09:38.17]I don't know if you saw that.
[09:39.41]That's tough.
[09:40.31]You're close to a loaf.
[09:42.27]Not there.
[09:43.11]Maybe you'll get there.
[09:43.83]I actually don't think mathematically you can, but maybe someday.
[09:47.29]Get there like I'll work on I'll hold you know what I'll hold on 26 for a couple then you can get there You just need to bezos go into space and fly around close to light speed for a little bit, right?
[09:58.50]That's not that's the movie interstellar.
[10:00.88]You're mixing that up.
[10:01.64]I'm sorry.
[10:02.26]Yeah, I'm sorry that movie.
[10:03.64]Did you spoil the movie for me?
[10:05.42]You've never seen interstellar
[10:09.78]haven't that's insane wait till you hear about Richard branson I don't know movies I look I just like stare at the wall for 12 hours a day eat like cheesecake let me get you off to be clear it's okay to not understand tiktok right it's even okay to understand you know not understand some some more modern phrases you can't also tie in not seeing movies you know not reading books I'm also not up to date on politics he knows his bread though I will give you that
[10:36.31]Yeah, I'm a big fan of Brett.
[10:37.91]I am.
[10:38.37]What do you think you're super knowledgeable on if you're on a game show?
[10:41.03]What category are you killing?
[10:43.55]Oh, man.
[10:44.31]I don't know.
[10:45.21]Diablo II items?
[10:48.40]I'm serious, probably.
[10:49.54]That's so funny.
[10:52.04]Okay, yeah.
[10:53.12]Diablo II items.
[10:54.96]Let's think more conventional categories, perhaps, though.
[10:57.98]Like, if you're on the hit show Jeopardy.
[11:01.74]I would say, like, Attitude Era Wrestling.
[11:05.24]Attitude era wrestling.
[11:06.92]So not just wrestling, but attitude era wrestling.
[11:10.12]We've got to go pretty much from when Hulk Hogan went heel to like Stone Cold stuns the entire McMahon family.
[11:17.11]97 to 01, is that?
[11:17.69]96 to like 01, 02, probably.
[11:18.27]Right.
[11:18.39]Sorry, in what other categories was it?
[11:27.41]And Diablo II items.
[11:28.75]Right.
[11:29.44]That's it.
[11:30.08]Those are maybe the two most important things you could know in life, though.
[11:32.48]Let's be clear.
[11:33.62]I'm basically posturing to try to get you onto my game show, but now I'm concerned that the categories are going to be a little too catered.
[11:40.28]Oh, you're going to be Jerma and Ben SW going red.
[11:43.55]Yeah.
[11:47.09]The other contestants are going to be like, really?
[11:48.63]Diablo?
[11:49.23]Is this a big one?
[11:50.15]The next game's coming out, I guess.
[11:53.05]You know, it's funny.
[11:54.21]I've got a show coming up, too.
[11:55.35]It's interesting, right?
[11:56.36]Oh, yeah.
[11:56.66]I've heard about your show.
[11:59.06]Wouldn't it be weird if I was on the show?
[12:01.94]I mean, that would be very odd if you were one of the special guests pre-announced before a few days ago.
[12:06.80]If you were one of them, that would be interesting.
[12:08.32]So, chat, here we're happy to announce that I'll be on the show with Jerma in some, just in some, in some, you know, fun.
[12:16.61]In some fashion.
[12:17.51]Lighthearted fashions.
[12:18.90]Not to be leaked at this point.
[12:20.44]And, chat, I've got big news for you, too.
[12:23.56]Wait, this is maybe a bigger announcement?
[12:26.46]Yeah, well, sorry.
[12:27.70]I just really didn't want to get left out.
[12:29.28]It felt good.
[12:29.83]Wait, are you prepping the announcement to make your own announcement?
[12:34.17]I'll make an announcement.
[12:35.31]I'll make another announcement.
[12:36.75]I will jump on that announcement.
[12:38.11]Okay.
[12:39.03]Kit Boga's going to be there, too.
[12:40.09]Thank God.
[12:43.58]No, but that's not all.
[12:44.66]I got another announcement.
[12:46.35]Oh, here it comes.
[12:46.99]I've been waiting.
[12:47.67]I got another announcement.
[12:48.77]I have lost two pounds in the past week.
[12:51.61]Well, that's just a big shit.
[12:54.37]Okay.
[12:55.19]Alright.
[12:55.65]Don't call my weight loss a big shit.
[12:57.69]Did you actually lose a couple pounds?
[13:00.48]I did, yeah.
[13:00.88]I'm trying to lose ten by your show.
[13:04.04]Wait, you want to look good on camera?
[13:06.10]Yeah, yeah.
[13:06.96]Did you see that arrow?
[13:08.90]Yeah, that arrow's a big whiff.
[13:10.17]Oh, no, that's not good.
[13:12.33]To be fair, he did put one archer next to his other archer, which is about as bad as you can do it.
[13:18.79]Yeah.
[13:19.89]Sykuno also has not missed.
[13:21.59]Sykuno seems to be on fire today.
[13:24.61]But he's clearing out the ships and giving points to the other player.
[13:28.15]Are you, what is your strategy?
[13:30.09]I try to not do that.
[13:31.33]This was as quick as it can get.
[13:32.75]Oh, is it over?
[13:34.49]Unbelievable.
[13:35.51]Is it over?
[13:35.89]It's over.
[13:36.49]Yeah, that one, two, three, four, five.
[13:37.67]It wasn't close.
[13:39.35]It wasn't close.
[13:40.65]God, holy moly.
[13:42.74]Let's hop back in and see how they're feeling.
[13:45.50]That was the one I was hoping on.
[13:46.82]Gentlemen, how are you guys feeling?
[13:48.64]Oh, Jesus.
[13:49.74]I feel like I got really lucky.
[13:51.54]Yeah, I did feel like you would just click and you would hit something every time, and then Charlie would do archers and would hit nothing every time.
[13:58.30]And it would hit nothing.
[13:59.18]Oh, they missed.
[13:59.74]They were so close on so many.
[14:01.39]Oh, man.
[14:03.13]Yeah, God, those archers really let me down.
[14:05.87]Charlie, you know what I think it was?
[14:06.81]I got him that one time with the pretending it missed thing.
[14:10.05]Yeah.
[14:10.67]I feel like your mojo was a little off.
[14:13.05]I'm going to blame the black t-shirt.
[14:14.77]That might be it.
[14:15.53]Yeah, I'm still in a black tee.
[14:17.50]it was throwing us off on merch he's gonna say if you buy the mogul moves no no no no you can have better luck next time white t-shirt white t-shirt wait yeah Charlie usually wears white yeah yeah it would be funny to throw his loss into a self-shameless plug but I have some self-respect here well I did it for you so true yeah he did your marketing for you appreciate that I'll be honest Charlie had a huge lead there I thought I was done so but somehow at the last
[14:46.76]Yeah, I thought I had a good strategy just scanning the ships and saving ammo, but Sycuna was just striking my shit off so quickly.
[14:53.78]I just guessed based on the placement, because people usually spread them out a certain way.
[14:58.98]And no arrows hit that whole game.
[15:01.44]Yeah, not a single one.
[15:02.22]That's true.
[15:02.90]That's a lot of arrow points being used, yeah.
[15:06.21]Charlie, you still can't compete for 100 gifted against the loser of this next match, so you're not out of it yet.
[15:11.25]And we got Stans versus...
[15:14.83]Jerma right now alright good luck I'll make sure on the game I forgot all about that part oh yeah you have to actually open the game yeah sorry why would you get the crunch this morning it took forever it's in the the general chat the uh the code
[15:27.27]Stance's cam is atrocious.
[15:28.39]Stance, real quick, your cam is atrociously big.
[15:30.09]It's so big.
[15:30.57]I like the placement of the ships.
[15:31.49]By Stance?
[15:50.07]Yeah.
[15:50.39]For a second, I got kind of scared.
[15:51.35]Yeah, we're watching this from Stan's POV because Jerma's not live right now.
[15:57.38]But knowing Jermastrat, I imagine he will have quite a few huddled ships.
[16:03.26]Yeah, I bet they're all in the middle right now, hugging.
[16:06.38]That is how he got Simply.
[16:08.30]He had a couple hugging ships.
[16:10.70]Although, I will say, he has always lost game one.
[16:13.15]Jerma Plaza.
[16:14.31]Really?
[16:14.81]Uh-huh.
[16:15.73]In the one game he has played.
[16:17.07]Yeah.
[16:21.23]100% of the time.
[16:23.21]I don't know if I like the scanning meta.
[16:25.07]That's a very wide area.
[16:26.87]Yeah.
[16:27.61]I mean, it's effective though.
[16:29.36]It can be, but if you scan and you see one, you're going to waste your whole time there.
[16:34.30]And then they can add mines in there.
[16:36.10]True.
[16:36.92]I feel like when I tried it, it was like we're in the right place, but you just really hope they don't start hitting.
[16:42.70]Yeah.
[16:43.88]I think saving for power-ups can be a little more efficient.
[16:47.26]Yeah.
[16:47.86]Especially on the big map.
[16:48.92]I think the airstrike is much better than scans.
[16:52.87]Sykuno, I know your strat now.
[16:54.59]If you put a 2-ship in column 1 or column 10, I feel like that would destroy you.
[16:59.97]Like, vertically?
[17:01.69]There's 10 columns?
[17:04.10]Don't play dumb with me, stats major.
[17:07.22]What?
[17:07.98]You are super cool about a stats major.
[17:09.89]You cannot pretend you don't know columns and rows.
[17:12.25]The E10 thing is real.
[17:14.49]The E10 thing is real.
[17:16.27]E10.
[17:17.91]You can't even do it.
[17:19.13]I like falling for it because you'll never say it.
[17:22.61]Yeah, that's the whole plan.
[17:24.42]That's the whole plan.
[17:25.04]But you always like to do William Carr's lane bomb down the second column.
[17:30.24]Yeah, it's really good.
[17:31.36]Or the ninth column.
[17:32.42]So if someone snuck a little ship into column one, you would struggle to find it.
[17:37.57]Exactly.
[17:38.05]That's the one weakness.
[17:39.17]But for every other ship, it saves you space, sort of.
[17:44.21]Also, you can try and predict it.
[17:45.97]Like last time, Charlie snuck in the five piece on the left side.
[17:49.48]But I figured that's the only place he could have put it anyway, because...
[17:54.42]Yeah, the five-ship too is a shame.
[17:56.88]That's, I think, the worst part of the archer.
[17:58.46]Yeah, the archer just really let me down, like, badly.
[18:02.14]Yeah, and then the one time I pretended that it was bad luck, and then you just wasted another shot after that.
[18:08.17]True.
[18:09.03]The fact that you got my two ships, like, back-to-back really made it impossible to come back.
[18:12.91]Yeah, those are the hardest to find.
[18:14.31]I think killing smaller ships is actually better than bigger ones.
[18:18.11]Well, you have a bunch of bombs over here.
[18:19.57]I think he's loading up.
[18:21.33]That's what I will tell you, Northernlion did that to me and it blew my mind.
[18:25.33]There was nothing around it but bombs.
[18:27.89]Why is he not shooting in the scanned area at all?
[18:29.89]I think he's placing probes to scan off of.
[18:34.82]I actually think scans are a lot weaker on this map.
[18:38.26]But why scan when you've already scanned and the scan detects something?
[18:41.84]Yeah, that's a good point.
[18:42.98]You may as well at least try and tag it or something.
[18:47.88]He got it.
[18:48.46]Ooh, baby.
[18:50.58]So he must know where the other two are then, right?
[18:55.14]Why would he do that?
[18:56.47]It says two right there.
[18:59.59]One's a bomb, and I guess he was that scared of it.
[19:02.71]Oh, yeah, he's very afraid of the bomb, yeah.
[19:05.09]Yeah, a little too scared, arguably.
[19:08.49]Because he just stood a shot.
[19:10.15]Let's just vibe.
[19:10.81]How about that?
[19:11.63]Yeah, that was an interesting... What do you have?
[19:13.79]Alright, whatever.
[19:15.41]Okay, good, good, good, good hit.
[19:17.35]I like this.
[19:18.15]Oh, he's got it already.
[19:19.41]So his shot last turn that we predicted he would scan was just for fun.
[19:23.41]Why are they both doing, they're playing so weird.
[19:26.33]Wait, why didn't he go left or right?
[19:29.23]I don't know.
[19:30.03]He was really afraid of the mine.
[19:31.53]They might be so good at the game that they're playing with strategies we don't even know about yet.
[19:36.13]Oh, yeah, we just can't comprehend it.
[19:37.49]What's he doing now?
[19:38.14]He's not going for the... Oh, he got it.
[19:39.80]He just got it.
[19:40.34]That seems like he's cheating.
[19:45.46]He had a hit on another boat and then he just shot randomly.
[19:51.34]And now he's scanning?
[19:52.30]He's scanning the bottom right now.
[19:55.24]That's the crazy thing, it tells me all I need to know.
[19:56.48]Guys, they're too five-head for me.
[19:59.87]Well, there's a pretty common phenomenon in eSports, in Melee, in Smash, where you become so good that you can start playing like an absolute shitter and it works.
[20:11.33]You just do dumb stuff.
[20:12.18]Well, it just looks that way because we don't understand how advanced it is.
[20:15.74]No, I think it's E3.
[20:17.21]They're a level above us.
[20:18.13]That's your long guy.
[20:20.23]It's your long guy?
[20:21.89]Oh, he went up.
[20:23.23]He thinks it's the long guy.
[20:24.47]At least I know where those bombs are.
[20:26.15]No, I think he just guessed wrong on the three-piece.
[20:29.36]No, no, he just said out loud he thinks it's the long guy.
[20:31.22]He thinks it goes all the way across E for some reason.
[20:34.18]I don't know why.
[20:35.00]Okay.
[20:35.42]And I also don't understand Stan starting two ships, having no idea what they are, and then scanning for more.
[20:41.22]Okay, we're scanning.
[20:42.06]He hasn't determined the shape or anything like that.
[20:44.83]He just...
[20:48.29]Jerma can just load him up.
[20:50.57]The prediction's exactly 50-50, which I'm... I guess I'm not surprised by its battleship.
[20:56.90]Yeah, I was gonna say.
[20:58.22]You're just guessing where the shots are at the end of the day.
[21:00.94]Okay, you're not allowed to say this in a call with two people you beat in this event.
[21:04.54]I'm just saying I just got lucky.
[21:06.86]No, you're not allowed to say that.
[21:08.44]No, no, no.
[21:10.15]I could have easily lost.
[21:11.99]No, you beat me and Charlie.
[21:13.59]Alright, put me in the dirt game three.
[21:15.39]I felt bad for a while.
[21:16.38]I was thinking about it all night.
[21:17.72]What?
[21:18.90]I don't know about you, Charlie.
[21:20.20]I just got lucky.
[21:21.64]It's a guessing game, guys.
[21:23.51]Okay, he's going for another scan.
[21:25.53]I think he's doing what Charlie did.
[21:26.79]He's just trying to detect all the ships first.
[21:28.39]Can I say that?
[21:28.87]Can I say that I'm being bamboozled?
[21:30.23]I think that's a good strategy.
[21:31.55]But if you do that, can they just load up a bunch of mines, like in the bottom left?
[21:35.81]This is your turn.
[21:36.39]That's true.
[21:36.97]I want you to know.
[21:37.69]Yeah, but you'd know it's a mine because it'd go from zero to one.
[21:40.25]Oh, you mean around here.
[21:42.23]Because they know you're probing around.
[21:43.89]Yeah.
[21:44.35]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:45.94]Oh.
[21:46.10]I have a chance to...
[21:47.28]Oh, he got it.
[21:48.06]Yeah, he shot on the right first because he thought it was the long boy, but he figured it out.
[21:51.10]It was the fiver.
[21:52.10]I would say he's a bit ahead right now.
[21:54.14]Oh, what a bad... Oh, what a... Actually, a perfect... Expensive.
[21:58.53]That's good.
[21:59.25]He knows exactly... I mean, there's only one ship it could be.
[22:02.83]He's got it.
[22:03.43]That one's dead.
[22:04.37]Yeah.
[22:05.09]He uses Giuseppe, and Giuseppe always hits a 3x3 for 10.
[22:09.17]It's a better archer.
[22:09.69]I actually think he's better.
[22:11.38]It's better archers cost more energy though.
[22:13.14]It does cost you more.
[22:13.86]Yeah.
[22:14.30]Alright, Jerma seems like he's ahead, but having two two-pieces left is pretty hard.
[22:18.26]I actually am all the time.
[22:20.16]Yeah, yeah, those are the hardest to find.
[22:21.78]Oh wow, he saved up 15 points.
[22:23.26]Here's the worst part about the predicament that you put yourself in here.
[22:25.66]What is the worst part?
[22:27.54]You have one ship.
[22:29.32]I don't know if that was... Wait.
[22:31.60]I mean, it worked.
[22:32.18]Oh, you have a four.
[22:34.50]That ship was... You could have just got it.
[22:35.94]Oh, very interesting.
[22:37.39]You only have one guess around the entire edge.
[22:40.21]So... Sagan.
[22:41.99]You only have one guess on any of the edges.
[22:45.15]Oh, Jerma's playing mind games right now.
[22:46.93]Do I have only one guess on any of the edges?
[22:50.05]You're saying like where I have guessed should make you think about where I have placed?
[22:54.25]He's in his head.
[22:54.79]It seems like an odd spot to put that.
[22:58.57]Where have I been clicking?
[22:59.51]He does have a lot of information.
[23:01.51]I'm more confused now than I was before.
[23:04.53]Why is he scanning so much?
[23:07.35]I don't know if that scan was worth it because he already had the two beneath it so he already knew that
[23:12.35]Would you call it garbage, Sykuno?
[23:14.01]No, no, I would just say not peak efficiency.
[23:16.76]Chat, Sykuno's word's not mine.
[23:18.72]I agree, though, in part.
[23:20.38]What?
[23:20.94]It was a little harsh to call him a shitter, though, Sykuno.
[23:23.98]I'm just saying it's not.
[23:24.84]Surely I would have toned down the shitter comment.
[23:26.54]Because you already have the scan below it.
[23:27.90]You know it has to be connected because you've landed one hit below it, which means it has to already...
[23:32.69]And I wouldn't go so far to say he's below all of us, but certainly he's below that.
[23:37.05]Yeah, that's a good point.
[23:38.73]It's a good point, a little harshly worded, but still making some great points out there.
[23:43.06]As a champion, I can respect it.
[23:44.64]Yeah, there's the mine.
[23:45.42]Okay, well, it happens.
[23:46.34]I just went for it.
[23:47.46]Oh.
[23:47.80]Come on, give me something.
[23:48.98]No.
[23:49.10]If it hits the two, that would be crazy.
[23:50.88]If it hits the two, that would be something.
[23:53.72]You'd have to get super lucky for it.
[23:55.10]Frustrating.
[23:55.74]I think it's like a 10, 15% chance though, right?
[23:57.23]Mm-hmm.
[24:00.01]Alright, so here's the question here.
[24:01.65]I need to draw.
[24:02.23]Because they've already gotten rid of so many spaces.
[24:03.97]Oh, yeah, because they've gotten rid of a lot of spaces.
[24:06.09]Normally, it's... Some of the scan spaces.
[24:08.15]Saikuno, you should know this.
[24:09.30]If there's a hundred places, and there's four spots you can hit successfully, and you got two shots, what are the chances that they hit?
[24:18.04]Uh, pretty high chance, yeah.
[24:20.59]Super high chance.
[24:21.15]No!
[24:21.77]No!
[24:23.89]I'm asking because you're a stats major.
[24:25.55]I'm not asking because it's a pretty high.
[24:27.79]I'm saying, okay, there's 100 places.
[24:31.37]A ship takes up four of them.
[24:33.23]You can shoot randomly once.
[24:35.37]There's a 4% chance you hit a ship, right?
[24:38.15]Now, if you shoot twice, how does the percentage change?
[24:41.31]Well, it would be the chance of missing times the chance of missing.
[24:44.81]So 0.96 times 0.96.
[24:45.39]Chance of missing twice in a row.
[24:53.24]But then the chance reduces because one shot is already taken so then it's 0.96 times like The chance would increase a little bit because you have 0.96 times 0.95 Higher I think because there's one less place that it can hit since one was already hit, but it'd be like barely noticeable anyway anyway 7% chance.
[25:12.30]God you do no stats.
[25:13.36]You would be crazy and do something like this.
[25:14.95]This guy does no stats.
[25:16.07]But you didn't this time.
[25:17.41]Next time you would though.
[25:18.43]What was your, were you cum laude?
[25:20.76]Oh, okay.
[25:22.07]What?
[25:22.41]What does that mean?
[25:23.41]Cum laude.
[25:24.25]Magna cum laude.
[25:25.49]What is that?
[25:26.39]Cum.
[25:26.69]That's when you get, like, high... Yeah, you... Oh!
[25:31.04]Oh!
[25:31.92]You're the best battleship player you deserve to go to the grand finals.
[25:34.84]He just hit it!
[25:36.22]No, what if the mine kills all of his other ships?
[25:38.96]I don't even think it'll let... Yeah, it will just... Oh, yeah.
[25:40.93]Okay.
[25:41.17]It's over.
[25:41.59]Interesting.
[25:42.45]Oh, that was a solid victory.
[25:45.71]He had multiple ships still.
[25:49.19]Oh my gosh.
[25:49.87]Alright, let's listen in.
[25:51.19]That's your opponent now, Charlie.
[25:52.66]Jerma, you're going to meet Sykuno in the finals.
[25:55.78]And we have our third place match right now.
[25:59.80]And it is between Charlie and Sans.
[26:03.64]Alright, so this is either one sub or a hundred subs.
[26:06.43]This is...
[26:10.34]$5 versus $100, and it's best of one.
[26:13.24]Well, it's not $5 versus $100.
[26:14.40]It's $5 versus $500.
[26:15.46]Oh, yeah, that's right, actually.
[26:18.12]So ratio-wise, this game matters more than anything.
[26:20.53]Than any other game, yeah.
[26:21.95]We could make this one a best of three if you'd prefer because it is higher stakes if everyone's down.
[26:26.85]Let's see who wins the first game and we'll go from there.
[26:29.59]Let's see who wins the first game.
[26:32.12]If Charlie wins, we'll just call it.
[26:34.96]I'm also down to go Stinky map, the second map, the one that's a little juicy.
[26:38.40]Do you guys want to go Stinker?
[26:40.08]We can go Stinker.
[26:41.18]You want to go Stinker?
[26:42.58]Handshake to Stinker?
[26:43.64]Yeah, we'll do Stinker.
[26:44.54]Are you Bo1-ing Stinker?
[26:46.72]I'm down for, if you have time, I'm down for Bo3.
[26:48.88]It is going way faster, so we have... I'm down for three.
[26:53.18]I have to go at four, so I... That should be fine.
[26:57.22]We have an hour and 20 minutes for two best of threes.
[26:59.58]Okay.
[27:00.70]I just don't want anyone to get cut off because we are being silly on a Bo3.
[27:04.23]I think we're 100% clear for that.
[27:06.87]If we're doing both three, let's go standard stinky and then figure it out.
[27:10.11]Maybe even go best of seven here.
[27:12.18]Seven?
[27:13.70]I got a thing at four for four o'clock.
[27:15.38]What do you got going on at four?
[27:18.46]World Series.
[27:19.73]I will make the game.
[27:22.05]Alright.
[27:22.79]We'll start on regular then.
[27:24.45]A little regular Andy.
[27:26.11]Okay.
[27:26.75]And I will give you the lobby code.
[27:28.71]Here's some anecdotal evidence here.
[27:30.75]I've lost before this tournament probably 10 out of 12 games.
[27:37.27]When I started playing with Giuseppe, that changed immediately.
[27:40.33]Just want to let you know.
[27:41.19]That is true.
[27:41.75]He is very handsome.
[27:42.87]Yeah, he's really good.
[27:44.01]Yeah, I'm going Giuseppe.
[27:48.56]He's the one who just hits all 3x3, right?
[27:50.80]He's just a big 3x3 boy?
[27:51.82]He's a big 3x3 boy, yeah.
[27:53.86]That's what I was thinking.
[27:55.86]300 subs?
[27:56.70]200 subs?
[27:57.50]First place is 300, second place is 200, third place is 100.
[28:00.60]Jesus.
[28:03.08]Ludwig, that's like literal thousands of dollars in subs.
[28:06.29]Yeah.
[28:07.01]Jesus.
[28:07.47]This is the largest Battleship tournament of all time.
[28:09.51]Did you think we'd have a small budget for it?
[28:12.04]I mean, you're not kidding.
[28:13.34]I checked the who's streaming battleship category and there's literally like two people streaming it and you're not even streaming it.
[28:19.75]You're in just chatting.
[28:22.71]The greatest battleship tournament of all time.
[28:29.14]Not that technically you're not playing, so... Yeah, I was just chatting about the event because I'm not in it after all.
[28:36.33]Yeah, like you're just chatting about the event.
[28:38.99]Yeah, just like, you know, like when they spectate a Valorant tournament and then they list their category as...
[28:44.65]Just to, anyway, let's comment, let's watch the game.
[28:46.81]Nice to meet you, by the way, Jerma.
[28:48.80]Yeah, you too.
[28:49.68]You know, Ludwig told me you're the one who inspired him to play this game.
[28:53.58]Is that true?
[28:54.54]Um, a little, maybe.
[28:56.88]A little?
[28:57.68]I did, like, beg him over and over and over again.
[29:00.24]You begged him?
[29:01.58]Please, God, please help me do the battleship meta joke.
[29:04.91]And he was like, I don't know, man, it's kind of lame.
[29:07.77]oh and finally I convinced him I I said enough and he was like yeah I guess we'll just do that to get you to shut up and I think his exact words were if you don't play battleship you're not just done on Twitch you're done in this industry oh and then you got a multi-million dollar deal and you're rich and now I got a multi-million dollar deal and I'm rich I feel like we're actually developing the meta in some fashion I uh I just spam shots and hope they hit
[29:32.52]Turn no you do not maybe you do some very specific lines while listening to death note OST and going into deep detail about your psychoanalysis I just say a lot of words and it sounds smart because the music's on but I have no idea what I'm doing most That's where he's going for it's a 2x2 here.
[29:52.33]Yeah, this is bold.
[29:53.27]It's gonna hit early risk That's a good one.
[29:55.53]Actually.
[29:55.97]Oh, he backs out.
[29:56.95]He just backs out.
[29:57.99]No, she didn't
[29:59.67]I'm coming in.
[30:00.51]Oh, this is gonna whiff.
[30:01.86]This is gonna whiff and he's gonna be really mad.
[30:05.49]Oh.
[30:06.63]Oh.
[30:07.19]It is so close to hitting.
[30:09.41]Oh, and he hits a mine.
[30:11.19]Oh, where's that going to land?
[30:12.91]Whoa, man.
[30:13.67]That's rough.
[30:14.59]That's a rough one.
[30:16.41]Now, I've got to ask you, gentlemen, an important question here, and I'd appreciate your perspective.
[30:20.74]Are we thinking the hat backwards on stands makes him look good?
[30:26.22]Maybe kind of like that.
[30:27.00]Oh, I did not even notice that.
[30:28.16]What's up, fellow kids meme?
[30:29.54]What are we feeling about the hat?
[30:30.91]Um...
[30:31.77]You know, the only time I like seeing backwards hats is when Ash is about to throw a Pokeball.
[30:37.95]And that's it.
[30:39.35]He's very 90s.
[30:41.51]I'm not stylish, so I don't know.
[30:43.11]Yeah, I can't tell if it looks like he owns his own dispensary or he works at a startup.
[30:51.22]I worked at a startup before, and I've never seen a guy with a backwards hat.
[30:55.84]What was your last job before streaming?
[30:59.19]I'm a software developer.
[31:00.61]Okay.
[31:00.85]I don't want to say, like, all the companies.
[31:02.39]Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
[31:04.23]Jerma, what about you?
[31:05.75]I was a wedding videographer and a substitute teacher.
[31:10.11]That's awesome.
[31:12.20]Oh, my God.
[31:12.88]Charlie really put a lot into finding that 1-3 piece.
[31:16.12]But he did get it.
[31:17.26]I jumped from job to job.
[31:19.18]I didn't really have a career, you'd say.
[31:21.14]Were you jumping out of, like, I don't know what I want to do?
[31:24.39]Or were you just, like, canned as a substitute teacher?
[31:27.75]I think it was just, like, stuff that I knew was available.
[31:31.11]And I was like, I guess I could try that.
[31:33.29]I guess I could do that.
[31:34.15]And I have a video background, so... Can you...
[31:37.77]Sorry, and I hate to put you on the spot.
[31:39.93]You know that.
[31:40.53]Stop it.
[31:40.97]Stop.
[31:41.27]Leave me alone.
[31:42.15]Could you just do the teacher noise?
[31:43.99]What's the teacher noise?
[31:45.34]It's like Kuno would like to see it.
[31:50.20]I'm just the kid at the lunch table that you get to do the cool, like, crazy things.
[31:54.04]Hey, dude.
[31:55.10]Hey, I'll give you two of my fries if you make that crazy noise.
[31:58.02]No, I got a fruit roll-up.
[31:59.40]My mom packed me a fruit roll-up.
[32:00.54]She said I can give it to you if you do the noise.
[32:02.90]Okay, sure.
[32:03.41]In that case...
[32:09.33]Did it even pick up on the mic?
[32:10.61]No, nothing picked up.
[32:12.02]It didn't pick up on the mic?
[32:13.18]No.
[32:14.02]What?
[32:14.46]Are you serious?
[32:15.64]I just did it.
[32:17.06]Charlie's got a big one.
[32:18.08]You did not.
[32:19.28]Yes, I did.
[32:20.00]This is Jerma treachery.
[32:22.12]My noise gate shut it off.
[32:23.45]My noise gate turned it off.
[32:24.85]It didn't want you to hear it.
[32:26.31]He's gonna get the whole thing.
[32:27.01]No, he's a genius.
[32:29.71]He's a genius.
[32:31.41]I thought he would think it's the four-piece, but he... It could go in different shapes, though, right?
[32:35.49]No, no, this is the only shape it could be.
[32:38.45]There's no guesswork left.
[32:40.97]Could it not have gone I2 and then G3?
[32:44.33]And the T would have gone upwards?
[32:46.70]Oh, God, no!
[32:47.52]I don't think so, because he already had a shot on the...
[32:50.64]You can't claim anyone's winning yet until the, yeah, it's all about the twos.
[32:54.92]If somebody has one of the twos, that's how I determine if they're winning or not.
[32:58.56]Oh, that's gonna really hurt him.
[32:59.54]Oh my god, he's just sitting all around it.
[33:02.54]He's just playing a game of backflip.
[33:04.66]He gets so unlucky.
[33:06.75]He's literally got everything but the ships at this point.
[33:09.89]Isn't that actually kind of good for him now?
[33:11.17]Because he's cleared out the entire... Yeah, he'll figure it out for sure.
[33:13.93]Like the left row here, he has two ships.
[33:15.97]If he just shoots anywhere in there, he's going to hit.
[33:18.10]The only open areas are pretty much where ships are.
[33:20.76]So Charlie for sure should have this.
[33:22.34]Click.
[33:22.64]If he clicks right now, he gets a ship.
[33:24.18]No, not in the middle of them.
[33:25.42]He clicked in the middle of both ships.
[33:26.90]There's literally only one spot he can shoot.
[33:29.02]I think I'm too fixated on the left side.
[33:31.31]that's literally a game of backgammon that's what he's playing against himself he clicked in the middle not only that he just said I I'm too fixated on the left and there are two ships just toying with him he literally just shot everything around the ships and that's it that's so funny I was just right he's giving up on the left no he's no if he hits that the two that would be oh my god where is he
[33:52.19]Oh, that's right next to it, isn't it?
[33:54.75]Yeah.
[33:55.61]Okay.
[33:56.19]He's been one away from two ships right now.
[33:59.61]Pretty much shooting everywhere except for where he needs to be shooting.
[34:02.44]Okay.
[34:03.96]He's still eyeing his left.
[34:06.54]He's got it.
[34:07.58]No, that'll hit.
[34:08.04]That'll hit.
[34:09.14]It'll hit, but I don't think it's necessary because, like, obviously...
[34:12.77]There's nothing in the bottom right at all He's gonna clear the bottom right five.
[34:24.09]There's nothing now a desperate man.
[34:25.25]What's he's gonna drop another?
[34:26.60]Yeah, that'll be the most depressing three missed bombardments Charlie still got both of his twos up, so he's good
[34:36.02]What if you convey, okay, my chat has entered a riot because of the teacher noise.
[34:39.36]Could I attempt it?
[34:40.43]If you could describe it to me?
[34:41.83]I'll just do it.
[34:43.23]I don't know why it didn't pick up.
[34:44.25]Okay, so if there's a bunch of rowdy kids, you come in and there's kids, a substitute teacher, what does that mean?
[34:49.62]What does that mean?
[34:50.94]You're a sub, what does it mean?
[34:52.72]You're in trouble.
[34:53.22]They don't respect you or something?
[34:55.26]it just means that like the teacher's not here oh wow no we have a sub today this is awesome oh we can like talk we can take sit in in seats that aren't our assigned seats and they won't even know uh-huh they'd be rowdy they'd be making all kinds of noise and what you would do is you would simply just go in you would hear the routing you hear the noise and you'd okay everybody my name is Mr. Elbertson nice to see everybody uh and then they wouldn't be listening and you would just kind of step back and you'd go okay here's how I'm gonna go like this
[35:25.97]And they would, they would, they would all turn their fucking heads like parrots and sit there and pay attention.
[35:32.76]And I go, now that I have your attention, here's the math worksheet.
[35:35.74]So you're a bit of a hard ass.
[35:37.63]Oh, it just was easy.
[35:38.41]It was easy to get.
[35:38.95]I was just getting attention.
[35:41.23]So it's the cough.
[35:42.19]Did the noise gate get it?
[35:43.75]Did you guys hear it?
[35:44.83]Let me, I'll imitate it.
[35:47.81]That's all I heard.
[35:48.83]Unless that was a preface to the noise.
[35:50.59]I just heard a noise.
[35:53.50]I thought the cough clearing was the noise.
[35:55.42]Was that the preface to the noise?
[35:57.82]Okay, I'm going to turn my noise gate off on Discord.
[36:00.54]This doesn't make any sense.
[36:02.20]It's deleting the high-pitched sound.
[36:04.88]High-pitched sound?
[36:06.32]Hold on.
[36:06.82]Is it only audible from dogs?
[36:09.30]Yeah.
[36:11.01]Hold on.
[36:11.83]Okay, can you guys hear me now?
[36:13.11]I can hear you perfectly.
[36:14.05]Yep, I can hear you.
[36:15.45]Am I being like cut off by like a noise gate or anything like that?
[36:19.19]You can hear me, right?
[36:20.21]Nothing to my knowledge is being cut off.
[36:21.69]Okay, so how about now?
[36:23.63]Yeah.
[36:24.81]Can you literally hear everything in my background too?
[36:27.15]Nothing, no.
[36:28.47]What's in the background?
[36:29.77]What should I be?
[36:30.41]There's a fan going right now.
[36:32.47]So if I were to go like this, like...
[36:35.81]Are you getting that?
[36:36.79]No.
[36:37.11]What?
[36:37.89]Are you serious?
[36:38.93]Are you not... Are you hearing this?
[36:40.43]Oh, yeah, yeah, I hear that.
[36:41.33]I hear that.
[36:41.73]It's like a beep.
[36:42.43]It's like a... It's like a... Beep.
[36:45.05]Beep.
[36:45.91]Yeah, I heard a little beep.
[36:47.39]Yeah.
[36:48.67]Okay, hold on.
[36:49.59]I gotta keep, like, the noise going, so my... I don't know why it's deleting it.
[36:54.00]What kind of... I gotta keep this.
[36:56.02]Is this like a bird squawking?
[36:57.68]Like a high-pitched... I'm excited for the noise.
[36:59.76]It's very high.
[37:00.28]Okay, here we go.
[37:00.98]I'm gonna, like... Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
[37:03.06]Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
[37:05.80]Is that coming through?
[37:06.96]That's the noise?
[37:09.07]Oh, Charlie's got him.
[37:10.33]He's got him.
[37:11.37]The best part about that is that you have to do the bop, bop, bop before the noise.
[37:16.61]Because it won't pick up.
[37:17.70]I know, so you have to, like, wind it up.
[37:20.28]Okay, how about now?
[37:21.80]If I go...
[37:26.95]It's not doing this when I do the dit.
[37:28.75]No, it's cutting out slightly.
[37:30.94]It sounds like you're playing the highest note possible on a guitar.
[37:34.00]Or Alvin and the Chipmunks got chipmunkified to be another octave higher.
[37:38.96]I have no idea why.
[37:39.84]Anyway, the game's happening, guys.
[37:42.00]Still, they're doing great.
[37:44.04]A very close game.
[37:45.18]What an annoying introduction to Sykuno.
[37:47.68]Huh?
[37:48.38]Oh, hi, Sykuno.
[37:49.18]My name's Jerma.
[37:50.75]He's saying he's giving annoying sounds the first time meeting you.
[37:55.03]No, no, it's, it reminds me of, like, Animal Crossing.
[37:58.61]You okay with that?
[37:59.54]You know the Animal Crossing villagers?
[38:01.50]It does sound like Animal Crossing.
[38:03.15]Yeah, a little bit like that.
[38:04.71]Oh, he's got the small one scanned.
[38:07.31]He probably won't guess the one in the top left, though.
[38:09.19]That one's messed up.
[38:09.77]Sycuno's the actual production that keeps us on track, Jerma.
[38:13.85]We were talking last time we were doing commentary.
[38:15.77]We're doing our best as commentators, but maybe sometimes missing the heavy action.
[38:22.92]And you keep us right.
[38:24.44]You keep us on course.
[38:26.40]Keep the boats steady.
[38:27.70]Mm-hmm.
[38:28.48]that's right I think it actually is kind of funny that that won't come up it won't pick it up for some reason Discord is like compressing it to a point where they they think that that's a horrible noise you shouldn't be hearing yeah this is a specific decision by Mr. wampus oh this is a huge scan
[38:44.42]There it is.
[38:46.72]I think Charlie's on pace now.
[38:48.44]Charlie's got a good spot.
[38:49.80]He's got four ships secured.
[38:52.86]So he knows the two ships are at the top.
[38:54.37]Now we've got something interesting going on.
[38:57.35]Let's, uh, why don't we make it six?
[38:59.21]I think the line on the left side is pretty much protected because there's nowhere else it could fit on there.
[39:04.25]Which means there's one two and a four, chat.
[39:07.50]I'll show the clip after, guys.
[39:08.30]I'm not going to show it right now.
[39:09.20]Clear some lines here.
[39:10.32]He's going to get both those ships.
[39:12.56]That was the worst guess anyone's made in the history of Battleship Chat.
[39:15.48]Did he just shoot into a zero?
[39:17.64]Oh, no.
[39:19.32]You have so many minds here.
[39:20.70]I've done it before.
[39:24.08]The Northernlion 5 Mine Gambit is about to win the game and the YouTube video is going to be juicy.
[39:31.97]I can safely shoot outside of my scan and come in.
[39:36.03]What was that logic?
[39:36.53]He said I can shoot safely outside my scan and come in, but he's just letting his opponent put another mine in that spot.
[39:49.70]Okay, so that was Braindead.
[39:51.12]Oh, no.
[39:51.78]He mindgamed him too much.
[39:53.80]Like you said, he thinks it's just riddled with bombs.
[39:55.78]Yeah, he does.
[39:57.35]How many mines did he put down, though?
[39:58.85]He barely put any.
[39:59.47]There's only one mine.
[40:00.39]He just put it after the scan.
[40:01.99]Yeah, I feel like he shouldn't be that afraid of them, but...
[40:05.07]I think, uh, Charlie did have a match.
[40:07.72]There's no way he guesses this two-piece, right?
[40:10.22]Almost no way.
[40:10.90]He shot everything around it.
[40:13.04]So I have a good strategy here, I think.
[40:14.80]I'm going outside of the six.
[40:16.78]Because every fucking tile here has a mine, basically.
[40:19.55]There's no way Charlie falls for this one.
[40:21.49]No, I don't think so.
[40:22.37]He's going to hit right here, I think.
[40:23.69]I think there's a bit of a problem here in the sense that... Oh, he hits!
[40:27.87]They're going for outside, but he's hitting it.
[40:29.82]Okay.
[40:30.32]He knows.
[40:32.00]He knows the four, though.
[40:33.68]Interesting.
[40:34.54]The three is still available.
[40:35.72]He might go left or right here.
[40:37.98]I think he should go straight up because he should be able to deduce that the amount of ships or ship pieces inside the scan, the four has to be in there, and that's the only way he can fit in.
[40:48.31]Taking some risks.
[40:50.31]It was the four.
[40:50.77]I'm nervous.
[40:51.43]Let's go.
[40:51.87]Okay.
[40:52.83]So I've got the dick and balls.
[40:54.10]I've got the four.
[40:56.74]Did you hide the three in there?
[41:00.18]You had, like, ghosts in your room.
[41:01.48]They were just, like, in your wall for a second.
[41:03.48]My laugh?
[41:04.60]You just heard, like, I heard, like, Charlie in the background.
[41:07.10]Then I heard, like, oh!
[41:08.53]Yeah, that's, my laugh is, I have a atrocious movie laugh.
[41:13.89]If I'm in the theaters, it's just truly abhorrent.
[41:17.35]Like, Charlie's got them.
[41:18.27]Who laughs at movies in the movie theater?
[41:21.03]Yeah, but I laugh at like like not like jokes like I'm not gonna laugh at like Dom Toretto being like but this time is for family It'd be like absurd moments or like weird mannerisms, and no one else laughs in the movie theater And I'll laugh like this I'll go haha and no one will laugh with me options for a four that I don't have movie theaters I don't laugh when I'm watching movies because I feel I like I internalize it I try to like stunt it a little bit
[41:46.57]Wait, you specifically thwart your laughter in hopes of what?
[41:50.40]Well, just because, I don't know.
[41:52.65]You don't want to be the guy at the movie theater that everybody knows is like the laughing guy.
[41:56.06]I'm the laughing guy.
[41:56.94]That's what I mean.
[41:58.04]I don't want to be that guy.
[41:59.35]Well, no one's going to judge you for having fun and laughing, right?
[42:02.39]Let me tell you, actually, you'd be surprised.
[42:04.27]I do get judged quite a lot.
[42:05.69]My roommates make fun of me incessantly.
[42:07.95]Your roommates make fun of you for laughing?
[42:09.93]For laughing at inappropriate times at inappropriate volume levels.
[42:15.40]Oh, yeah.
[42:17.62]Okay, let me ask you this.
[42:18.66]Are you the guy that does these two really important things here?
[42:22.34]Okay.
[42:22.56]So there's the guy that laughs a lot at the movie theater, then you hear the camera iPhone click sound.
[42:27.42]Are you that guy?
[42:28.59]Oh, Charlie's gonna win.
[42:29.67]He's about to win right now if he... I would never click.
[42:33.45]Oh, this is a bomb.
[42:34.21]It's gonna be mine.
[42:35.81]If he had one below, he wouldn't hit big.
[42:38.11]It's fine.
[42:38.77]He knows something.
[42:39.99]There's only one direction it can go because he closed off all the other options.
[42:43.43]Has to go down, and then he's gonna guess to the left because of the scan.
[42:46.91]Okay.
[42:47.31]Charlie knows for sure.
[42:48.53]He can finish it this round.
[42:49.51]Do you think he gets left or right here?
[42:50.68]Do you think he gets it?
[42:51.84]Wait, this is free then.
[42:53.28]Wait, no, but you played.
[42:54.86]No, wait, it has to be this way.
[42:56.40]Yeah, he knows.
[42:57.40]Okay.
[42:58.14]It was a good game, Stans.
[42:59.86]Alright, Charlie could win right here, I think.
[43:01.97]He's got it.
[43:03.01]Charlie's calling good game.
[43:04.13]Oh, you stole the two.
[43:05.61]You're right.
[43:06.15]Really?
[43:06.37]Yeah, Charlie has to know.
[43:07.09]He just called good game, and I don't know why.
[43:10.79]Because he's about to win.
[43:11.83]He's got it here.
[43:12.55]I forgot.
[43:13.15]I thought I had both twos.
[43:14.34]Okay.
[43:15.84]He doesn't know where the two is, though.
[43:16.95]It could be horizontal.
[43:18.71]Yeah.
[43:19.25]It could be horizontal.
[43:21.29]I may have thrown... I think the best shot is D1 or F1, the corner.
[43:25.27]I feel like it can't all be mines over there.
[43:27.35]The corners would be the best because it eliminates two possibilities.
[43:30.53]And since he knows it's actually... But I don't think he'd put the two next to the four.
[43:34.98]Because you know it won't go up and down there.
[43:36.94]Unless you think there's two mines inside, which he knows there isn't because he knows the initial scan was a five.
[43:41.89]What?
[43:42.11]Let's just, let's go back to fundamental battleship.
[43:45.82]Wait, whoa.
[43:46.66]What?
[43:48.47]Why would he do that?
[43:49.59]He convinced himself that all the three things over there were mines.
[43:53.20]I don't know.
[43:54.64]But he scanned it.
[43:58.42]That was very nonsensical.
[44:00.74]Now, very fortunately for him, you'll notice that Stan's looking at the bottom.
[44:04.40]It's because he's three-scanned in the top left, so it can't be in A1 through 3.
[44:09.18]He's three-scanned at C4, so it can't be that section.
[44:11.91]He'll never guess it.
[44:12.77]It's A4 and 5.
[44:14.55]It would be absurd to shoot A4 and 5.
[44:17.09]They're the only two places that were dodged there.
[44:19.73]This is the absolute luckiest spot.
[44:21.01]It has to be a huge hunch.
[44:22.43]And since it's a two-piece, it could be anywhere.
[44:24.45]I think Charlie's got it if he goes for the scan.
[44:28.02]Charlie's a bit of an overthinker here.
[44:29.48]I don't think there's a way that Charlie loses this game.
[44:34.14]Well, if Stans hits right now, that's it.
[44:36.34]He's got...
[44:38.21]Because if he hits a four and five, he just guaranteed gets it.
[44:41.32]Alright, Charlie's got this.
[44:43.68]I don't know why he shot in the bottom left last time, but this time I think he's got it.
[44:46.64]Well, he has enough points that I think now he can just... He's just going to bomb it.
[44:49.97]Oh, no, he doesn't have a bomb yet.
[44:51.49]Why is he doing this?
[44:52.87]Here's the thing.
[44:53.45]Wait, Charlie?
[44:54.81]okay okay scanning the bottom there is only he would have seen that the number on the left scan go up wouldn't you know that you're desperately trying to see yeah he should know the initial scan was a five yeah unless he thinks that stands put a bunch of bombs there and is trying to delude him what is he doing just just being he he he thinks those are all bombs he could be that way guys or it is
[45:16.41]Charlie can't blame him because that's what that's a strategy that all workable strategy.
[45:19.97]There's so many mine I think the thing is I feel like usually you wouldn't try and create a full-on fake ship usually try and get people to guess If there is a ship on there that would all you that so you don't make you think Oh, this could be a YouTube video.
[45:36.21]I told him where it was Yeah
[45:43.47]I'm uncomfortable watching this knowing that Charlie's going to shoot G9 right now of all spots.
[45:49.99]Why would the number have gone up, Charlie?
[45:51.37]Think about it.
[45:51.95]Vomit all over my desk?
[45:54.29]Yeah, you should know that, right?
[45:55.43]It's such a risk.
[45:56.07]The only reason to put mines there is because there's another ship there.
[45:59.09]8, G9, and F9.
[46:02.01]Those three, and I'd have to shoot at G9.
[46:04.79]And it could also be G4, G2, F2, and then, of course, F, E, D1.
[46:11.10]He's going to hit a bomb.
[46:12.14]And then D2.
[46:13.10]He's going to hit a bomb.
[46:13.94]Now, shooting in the middle at E1, that clears F. That's a hit right there.
[46:18.72]That's a good one.
[46:19.14]That clears shit.
[46:27.96]I thought he was gonna click one of the bombs and confirm to himself that, yeah, forget about going left side.
[46:35.14]I'm so disappointed, but also so confused.
[46:39.58]We might have to make this best of one.
[46:40.68]This game went much longer than I thought.
[46:42.39]Yeah, this one's taking a minute.
[46:44.47]Honestly, this has been a good game.
[46:45.85]It's been close.
[46:46.65]It's been intense.
[46:47.53]It's a fucking whirlwind.
[46:49.13]This has been one of the games of the tournament, I would say.
[46:52.61]Yeah, this has been an absolute marathon.
[46:56.55]What do they call it?
[46:58.95]Honestly, no matter what happens, you have been a fearsome foe.
[47:04.71]He still is.
[47:05.67]Even if he messes up another three or four times, Stanz still has to find that two up in the top.
[47:10.53]But the areas it could be for Stanz, it's getting very small.
[47:15.72]Well, it could be cringed beneath this.
[47:17.62]It could be in a lot of spots.
[47:20.40]Just because it's a two.
[47:21.14]Yeah, he's looking up there, too.
[47:22.98]Could be right there.
[47:23.66]Yep, he's looking there also.
[47:25.02]Hopefully Charlie just saves enough for a bomb.
[47:28.05]That's all he needs to do.
[47:29.13]Yeah, you gotta stop doing the scans here, and you gotta start dropping the two-by-two bomb.
[47:32.66]If he just dropped the bomb, he'd be out.
[47:35.14]There's no way he still thinks it's not in that scan.
[47:37.63]I mean, he's had it scanned for like five... Wait, what happened?
[47:40.89]I think Charlie's stream crashed.
[47:43.27]It crashed?
[47:44.41]Only a couple places, like one side of this board.
[47:49.06]He has to know.
[47:50.02]He's got it.
[47:50.48]He's going to click this one.
[47:53.14]I have to go inside this game.
[47:56.04]This clears the most.
[48:00.06]It doesn't make sense to click there because you know it can't be below it.
[48:07.97]It could hit, but it didn't.
[48:10.19]That's lucky.
[48:11.13]It cleared a lot for me, though.
[48:13.03]That was actually big.
[48:14.83]I still think he can click every single one of these spaces and hit two plus bombs and be fine.
[48:20.12]Oh, no.
[48:20.74]Oh, no.
[48:21.78]Oh, this is bad.
[48:22.58]If he scans in the bottom.
[48:24.32]Oh, that's going to miss.
[48:26.98]Oh, it hits.
[48:27.52]No, it's going to hit.
[48:28.16]It's going to scan one.
[48:29.38]Oh, this is over now, I think, right?
[48:30.85]Oh, no, he could.
[48:32.01]No, it's over.
[48:32.85]It's over.
[48:33.53]The scan reveals it can't be on the right side.
[48:35.59]It has to be on the left side.
[48:36.93]Wait, why could it not be on B6, B7?
[48:38.59]Because he has scans all around it, right?
[48:40.91]no no see b7 it's a 50 50 it could be b6 b7 and he shoots if it was b6 b7 it would say two oh yeah it would have said two if it was b6 unless you hit the mine I guess yeah he choked I mean he's probably still gonna win because it seems like Charlie is too afraid of those mines but okay one thing I need to know for sure so this is make or break this will tell me a hundred percent if it's why is he doing
[49:08.32]Charlie, what are you doing?
[49:10.48]Wait, it's outside?
[49:11.08]No!
[49:11.76]No, it's a mine.
[49:14.88]It's a mine.
[49:16.04]What are you doing?
[49:16.98]Oh my god.
[49:17.40]He's had it found for like 10 rounds.
[49:19.02]Oh my god.
[49:19.70]Oh no.
[49:26.57]I'm starting to question this.
[49:27.77]This can only mean that it's directly under where I scanned and then down.
[49:33.34]I'm going for it.
[49:34.02]I think.
[49:35.18]I'm either the dumbest man alive or a genius.
[49:36.60]You are the dumbest man alive.
[49:38.46]Oh, he clicked it.
[49:40.50]Oh, no.
[49:42.94]Hopefully it misses so there's still a way for him to win because uh Stans could guess the wrong way on the four ship.
[49:50.41]Oh, no, we can't oh, no, you can't it's it's over honestly it should have been over last round, but Stance one sure one yeah, okay?
[50:00.14]He doesn't know terribly misunderstands gotta be
[50:02.92]Wait, I guess, couldn't it be A7 and A8?
[50:06.68]A7 and A8?
[50:07.82]No, it couldn't be.
[50:09.15]The other scan would also say two.
[50:10.65]Because he knows there's a two in the top, right?
[50:12.73]I think I did it, but I might fuck up because I'm the stupidest man alive.
[50:16.65]I don't think there's a 50-50.
[50:18.01]I think I think I won.
[50:18.77]Yeah, I think it's this.
[50:26.15]THE MINE GABBIT!
[50:27.79]Oh, that's only game one.
[50:28.95]Holy shi- I think we might have to make this the best one.
[50:33.40]I think that, yeah, because that one was long.
[50:36.10]I should have went with my gut.
[50:37.50]I was gonna go E1.
[50:38.64]I can't believe you guessed outside on a mine I put just to catch a wide boy.
[50:42.66]I thought, I just didn't think you'd place on the outside.
[50:45.76]Yep.
[50:47.00]uh we might have to um well I guess we you could do a best of three but we might just not be able to throw it on the yeah actually you can just keep playing out best three okay we'll just have to start the other game right now too though okay that's fine okay that's fine yeah yeah we'll play it out yes um okay you can pick the map actually I I thought of a genius idea let's just play both at the same time because they thought it would be best of three so rather than cut them off okay yeah yeah that's an idea we could just start your match now
[51:09.01]I think that's the best.
[51:09.71]That's the best for everyone.
[51:10.89]It's maybe not the best for the stream, but this is just better for everyone.
[51:13.62]Clip.
[51:14.22]Guys, after did not mean after the game.
[51:16.08]It meant after the tournament.
[51:18.24]If it's like a ton of noise and a bunch of kids like, oh, fuck you.
[51:23.36]Look at that.
[51:24.70]You just walk in and you just go like.
[51:29.49]And they'll all go.
[51:32.35]It's like that Animal Crossing song.
[51:34.59]Blip.
[51:38.68]Alright.
[51:41.20]Oh, gosh.
[51:41.52]That was so close, guys.
[51:43.10]So this is the board that Jerma used.
[51:45.55]You'll see something very peculiar about it.
[51:48.49]Very peculiar indeed about Jerma's board.
[51:51.07]That's pretty aggressive.
[51:53.67]Now let's look at Sykuno's board.
[51:55.15]I'm just going to do this, I guess.
[51:56.75]Oh, what?
[51:58.39]Oh.
[51:58.57]Well, that's lucky.
[51:59.69]That's good.
[52:01.41]Oh.
[52:02.07]Oh, no.
[52:02.91]Let's see.
[52:04.31]Could be the four, could be the T. Okay, saved.
[52:07.77]Or something else.
[52:09.73]Saikudo's board, much more conventional.
[52:12.02]And that's our championship bracket.
[52:13.76]Going over real quick, the game two they decided to play on, I believe, St.
[52:18.92]Fort Angelio, or Fort St.
[52:20.88]Angelio.
[52:21.32]I say that backwards.
[52:22.88]And they're taking a quick break.
[52:24.18]You can see the build out here.
[52:25.58]Alright.
[52:26.22]Pretty conventional from Charlie.
[52:27.70]Left side.
[52:28.74]Stan's going for some risky plays in the top right here.
[52:31.87]But back over to our championship match.
[52:33.51]Jerma hits.
[52:34.13]That was good.
[52:34.73]It was a one in eight chance.
[52:36.93]That was a good one.
[52:38.41]Jesus.
[52:39.49]I feel like you probably went up.
[52:42.49]It says zero, so it could not possibly have gone that way.
[52:45.13]Oh shit!
[52:46.75]Oh my god, I just psyched myself out!
[52:48.95]It's okay, it's okay, it happens.
[52:50.44]The stress gets to all of us.
[52:54.72]That's awkward.
[52:58.20]It was down.
[52:59.50]So this is likely the T, but there's multiple ways it could go.
[53:02.37]It could go up or left or right.
[53:03.79]Is there?
[53:04.59]Oh yeah, it could be... I feel like up would be too tricky, so maybe...
[53:09.13]Oh, yep, like this.
[53:10.33]Okay.
[53:11.69]And Sykuno doing the strat where he leaves the last piece so he doesn't give the points.
[53:14.84]Really playing his heart out here.
[53:16.12]Sykuno is a competitive man.
[53:17.74]I feel like up would have been too strange for him to go.
[53:19.54]I am a stupid person.
[53:21.28]No, you're not.
[53:21.90]You're too in fine.
[53:23.48]It's just a minor mistake.
[53:27.83]Okay.
[53:29.29]Oh.
[53:30.65]That's alright.
[53:31.11]There's only one direction it could go now, so you figured it out.
[53:33.53]Very true.
[53:34.41]Mm-hmm.
[53:35.69]Oh, you really like putting those mines down.
[53:38.32]I'm trying to get you.
[53:39.54]You probably will.
[53:40.96]There's a strategy I always do, and I might fall for it this time.
[53:45.27]Okay, so remember, all of Jerma's ships are along the coast.
[53:49.75]Sykuno, if he guesses in the middle at all, will whiff.
[53:52.57]However, he uses William Carr's lake.
[53:55.11]Oh, God.
[53:55.78]Okay, alright.
[53:57.84]Oh, three.
[53:59.18]Could be mines, though.
[54:00.38]He has put down two or three mines already.
[54:02.14]He picks up on patterns quick.
[54:03.86]What is that?
[54:04.36]Is it two?
[54:05.00]Definitely not a two.
[54:07.11]It's either a... Is that your two?
[54:10.17]Is that your two?
[54:12.51]After shooting twice and hitting twice is very funny.
[54:17.42]Oh.
[54:18.14]No?
[54:18.24]Alright.
[54:19.64]Why does it feel like when confronted with the best possible option and the worst possible option, Jerma often picks the latter?
[54:27.61]Oh, God.
[54:29.31]Okay.
[54:30.31]Let's see.
[54:31.28]Do I think you've studied my strategies?
[54:33.20]Because there is a move I always do.
[54:35.78]Ludwig did this to me once.
[54:37.77]I don't know.
[54:39.35]I'm just trying to... I'm trying just to play.
[54:42.23]Play games.
[54:42.85]Do you guys think he studied my strategies?
[54:44.45]Alright, so my logic here is... Let me... The strategy would be devoiding all ships from row two.
[54:51.73]So I'm thinking it's very unlikely it's down here, right?
[54:54.93]So three either means we have an entire three-piece or connected pieces in here.
[54:59.86]If it's connected pieces, it's unlikely to be on the bottom row because the bottom row is empty because it's a zero.
[55:05.46]Well, you have a lot of info.
[55:06.86]The safest shot would be, it's either a long one or it's two ships.
[55:11.81]Or it's the three.
[55:12.39]That's going to be a hit.
[55:13.61]It's the top row.
[55:14.47]I'm going with this one.
[55:15.23]Top right.
[55:15.97]Oh, huh.
[55:17.39]I wonder if this is possibly... It's either that or I've detected two ships at once.
[55:20.73]No, what?
[55:21.72]Oh.
[55:21.84]It's not the three.
[55:23.47]Mm-hmm.
[55:24.11]That means there's only one thing it could possibly be, right?
[55:25.98]There's only one other possibility.
[55:27.78]Mm-hmm.
[55:28.98]Jerma is building up his points.
[55:30.26]Sykkuno is as well.
[55:31.14]It could be the three or it could be the four.
[55:33.36]I guess let's find out.
[55:34.14]Ooh.
[55:35.94]Oh, it must be the four then, right?
[55:38.65]Okay, he has a 50-50 here, left or right?
[55:40.57]Four left of the corner.
[55:42.59]I guess I should find out now.
[55:43.71]Oh, to the left.
[55:44.91]Very good, very good, very good.
[55:46.63]Alright, T is done, so all I have to do is find the three and the two twos.
[55:51.31]Let's try to do this.
[55:53.75]Oh!
[55:55.05]No!
[55:55.53]So if I remember something you commented on, you said I don't like putting things in corners.
[56:00.67]You said most people don't, which makes me think you might have put something in the corner.
[56:05.40]Oh, and it's not a two in the corner either.
[56:10.62]It's not the two, it must be the three, which means if you really put in the corner, it must be like this.
[56:18.59]Oh, alright.
[56:19.73]So you did put it in the corner.
[56:21.13]I just remember when we were commentating, you talked about how nobody puts it in the corner.
[56:25.14]Now, if you've been watching Jerma's career for a while, you'll know in best of threes, he often loses the first game.
[56:30.06]It's honestly a pretty smart strategy because he plays dumb game one in hopes that game two, his smart strategies will be a little more successful.
[56:39.38]And I think that's what he's going for here for sure and not just getting destroyed.
[56:43.52]Sykuno stream sniping someone who's offline.
[56:46.02]Yeah, five head.
[56:47.24]Well, you pretty much know what this one is.
[56:49.20]Actual five head.
[56:51.37]oh oh god okay it was it was that was a good shot it's a big deal one of the hardest to find yeah it could still go either way guys alright so then still two directions watch both streams of multi Twitch I could do that but I would like for this to be larger okay alright he's got it he's not gonna finish oh you finished it oh it's very polite thanks
[57:16.92]Because I get so caught up that if I don't finish it, it doesn't exist.
[57:23.40]Oh, yeah.
[57:23.76]And it's easy to get sidetracked if you look at the right side for dead ships.
[57:27.81]I'm just going to do it how I was doing it because I was good.
[57:29.69]Very good shot.
[57:30.35]Okay.
[57:31.89]He's got a lot scanned.
[57:32.83]But the thing is, this ship's just outside of the scan.
[57:35.25]It is pretty good.
[57:36.35]Alright.
[57:36.93]Here's the thing, though.
[57:37.67]You gave me a lot of energy with that.
[57:40.43]Also, based on your current ship placement, there's only three vertical rows you haven't hit yet.
[57:46.18]Three, four, and five.
[57:47.30]Every single row has a ship in it.
[57:49.28]So shooting four would shoot the middle of the rows you haven't... Let me discover a ship in.
[57:54.60]There's a mine!
[57:55.35]Oh, God!
[57:56.89]What?
[57:58.27]What are the chances?
[57:59.11]Oh, no.
[58:02.07]Okay, that's some good luck for him.
[58:04.19]Oh, this is the hardest to find.
[58:05.45]It's just two two-pieces.
[58:07.15]Based on the placement of the other ships.
[58:10.07]Unless you connected them in some strange way.
[58:11.95]Sykuno's still thinking rationally, and the thing about Jerma is he is irrational.
[58:16.63]But that's a good guess.
[58:17.99]That's the two-piece in the bottom left.
[58:20.33]Let's do this.
[58:21.27]Okay.
[58:23.75]Alright.
[58:24.49]I was right about the bottom left-ish, but it could be the mines.
[58:26.71]Honestly, Jerma has a chance here because he's hit a ship.
[58:29.19]He knows where this ship is, and he has a good amount of points left.
[58:32.59]If we look at Jerma's points, he's got three right now.
[58:34.83]He's hit this ship.
[58:35.51]He knows where this ship is.
[58:36.23]This is a pretty good spot.
[58:37.91]This could be anything, though.
[58:40.45]Let's just go for it.
[58:41.37]Let's go for the percentage here.
[58:44.19]Alright, I'm gonna need those turns.
[58:46.53]Bad shot feels bad, man.
[58:47.89]This is tough, guys.
[58:49.19]I'm actually in the disadvantage here.
[58:52.25]I wouldn't go that far, I think.
[58:53.83]Alright, it's possible I just detected a bunch of mines there.
[58:56.35]He's killed three ships and he knows where the fourth is.
[58:58.59]This one might be hard to find.
[58:59.49]Mine placement is very key for that reason, exactly.
[59:02.83]Two pieces.
[59:03.31]Jerma's incredibly unlucky with his shots, but let's also admit that Jerma does not think.
[59:08.57]And then when you combine those two elements, I think it's a little more reasonable to see that he misses.
[59:13.29]He might win this one.
[59:14.89]Oh God.
[59:16.07]Oh, he knows.
[59:17.45]He doesn't know if it's the three though, but he should know it's this.
[59:20.15]So you have, what do you have left?
[59:21.29]You have two, a three, and the Tetris piece.
[59:23.81]He should be able to figure out it's this because he scanned three and he knows I haven't put mines down.
[59:28.18]I think I'm going to lose this one.
[59:29.70]Oh, why does he?
[59:30.72]Oh.
[59:31.76]That should tell you everything you need to know I think is that a roast think I know with it did he just roast him Oh, no, that should tell you everything you need to know about the ship's location Well yours at home.
[59:43.64]That should tell you everything you need to know about Jerva Not enough Let's go this What oh now?
[59:52.72]It's a 5050 what?
[59:55.38]This is weird, guys.
[59:56.29]You don't think it's cringed in the corner, do you?
[59:59.15]Does he keep saying cringed in the corner?
[60:01.89]What is that phrase he's using?
[60:03.87]Who taught him that?
[60:05.77]That's not a phrase.
[60:08.13]I think he's going to win this one.
[60:09.13]He's got a huge lead.
[60:11.29]Ray told him it's cringed in the corner.
[60:13.03]That one's pretty much dead.
[60:14.01]This one might have a little guessing.
[60:19.36]I have never said cringe in the corner in my life.
[60:21.06]Guys, you just got better information.
[60:22.40]That mine was super lucky.
[60:24.30]If this is your two, this is a big deal.
[60:26.38]It would be, yeah.
[60:27.22]Alright, if he guesses left, there's two places to miss.
[60:31.41]If he guesses left or down, this is huge.
[60:33.29]Down to orientation.
[60:34.93]Oh, and it's Jerma, so he guesses it wrong.
[60:37.53]Obviously, there's no way to know, but it feels like he never hits.
[60:41.69]Oh.
[60:41.82]I would do... Sykuno double rowing it.
[60:46.32]Oh, this is going to be bad.
[60:47.20]Tell me something.
[60:49.81]Double mine.
[60:51.89]Let's see if it hits.
[60:53.11]It doesn't matter.
[60:53.65]He's pretty much got all my ships already anyway, so.
[60:56.29]Come on.
[60:57.33]Jesus.
[60:58.08]Decorating it.
[60:59.12]Decorating it.
[61:00.20]Alright.
[61:00.84]If your two is not in the scan and these are all mines, I might be done.
[61:06.60]Okay, he gets there.
[61:07.42]That's definitely a two then.
[61:10.30]All I have to do is find another two.
[61:13.52]He might try something.
[61:14.96]Let's just play normally.
[61:16.64]Ah, poop.
[61:17.82]Alright.
[61:19.32]I think normal placement would show it's around there, but it comes down to whoever finds the last two.
[61:23.91]I'm gonna get some olive oil, some salt.
[61:26.09]Yep.
[61:26.79]That's disgusting.
[61:27.45]It comes down to finding the last two.
[61:28.69]It's pretty much dead even.
[61:29.71]I'd say he has a minor lead right now.
[61:32.85]Just because he has more coverage.
[61:34.09]Okay.
[61:35.87]could um it could there's two possible ways it could go is there oh yeah it could be the other way okay so he knows what ship it is this ship is dead now all he needs to do is find the last ship Jerma does
[61:50.69]We have to get so lucky on this one if we want to win.
[61:53.71]He got a huge lead.
[61:54.39]He got a really good mine.
[61:55.95]Oh, jeez.
[61:57.13]Not over there.
[61:57.93]Yeah.
[61:59.61]Okay.
[61:59.92]Uh-huh.
[62:00.58]I think that might have been a waste.
[62:01.70]That might have been a... You got so much coverage.
[62:04.90]Might have been better to use scans.
[62:06.24]Yeah, this entire area is gone.
[62:08.32]This is going to get tight.
[62:09.94]Yeah, pretty much comes down to who finds the last two.
[62:12.52]So, Sykuno knows this one, Sykuno knows that one.
[62:15.36]The last ship Jerma has is on the right side right here on D10 and E10.
[62:19.30]I'd have to guess here, though, unless you put them... Alright, so I'm thinking the airstrike won't help me as much due to my current map coverage, so... It's only a two-piece left for each competitor.
[62:32.68]It's as close as it gets.
[62:33.40]Let's see.
[62:35.12]What's E10?
[62:35.94]He could have put it up here, but he wouldn't slink it like that.
[62:39.64]Maybe here?
[62:41.46]Huh.
[62:42.08]I'm low on ideas, guys.
[62:44.20]Now, the problem is Sykkuno plays smart where he destroys ships at the end to not give extra points to his opponent.
[62:51.35]Jerma, once he sees something on his plate, he devours it.
[62:55.15]It's East Coast mentality versus West Coast mentality.
[62:58.53]East Coast, you never know when you're going to get your next meal.
[63:01.17]Alright.
[63:01.61]Macky Mack and the Funky Bunch.
[63:03.44]West Coast, let's leave it for later.
[63:05.36]Let's pack it up.
[63:06.00]Let's get a doggie bag.
[63:07.28]Okay?
[63:07.86]And so that's what I'm concerned about here is giving the extra points.
[63:10.80]I like how he's not doing it though.
[63:11.92]Maybe he's learning a little bit from Sykkuno.
[63:14.62]Alright.
[63:15.60]It just comes down to who finds the last two, so.
[63:18.18]I'm East Coast?
[63:18.80]Yeah.
[63:19.54]I play like Jerma.
[63:20.28]I finish off my ships.
[63:21.30]I feel like you'd have to put it in the middle somewhere, but... Too stacked on the right side.
[63:27.56]Oh!
[63:29.14]Oh, he hovered over it.
[63:30.52]Maybe around here somewhere?
[63:34.00]Oh, God.
[63:34.54]Oh, God.
[63:35.42]He hovered over that.
[63:36.72]I was thinking you were up there.
[63:39.13]Oh, that's going to scan it.
[63:40.41]That's a perfect scan.
[63:41.81]This is bad, guys.
[63:43.51]Let's get some info.
[63:44.13]Did you say whole top row?
[63:47.17]Wait.
[63:47.69]Yeah.
[63:48.71]Oh, God.
[63:49.55]Oh, God.
[63:50.43]There you are.
[63:51.03]We're done, boys.
[63:51.85]We're done.
[63:52.41]And you're not up here.
[63:55.21]You're above somewhere.
[63:57.93]Mm-hmm.
[63:58.97]Alright, we're done up here somewhere.
[64:00.57]Okay.
[64:01.17]Oh, God.
[64:01.57]I have to get super lucky.
[64:02.89]Oh, he's very close.
[64:04.47]There's no way of peace.
[64:05.47]He's maybe two turns away from beating them.
[64:07.31]This is bad, guys.
[64:08.39]He knows this.
[64:08.79]But we have to understand.
[64:09.83]He scanned that.
[64:10.65]I have plenty of opportunity to miss.
[64:12.09]Sykuno has a lot of points here.
[64:13.79]I mean, I pretty much have to hit this one, so.
[64:16.15]I think he's going to scan something.
[64:17.47]Guess where it is.
[64:17.99]I know everything but the last two-piece.
[64:20.19]I think he's going to scan somewhere in the right, maybe.
[64:22.57]This scan right here is screwing him over because he's clearing off this row right here.
[64:29.01]Alright.
[64:29.73]I have to play like this is my last turn because it might be.
[64:32.04]Maybe.
[64:33.16]Final two-piece.
[64:34.76]Clears off a few spots.
[64:35.78]Oh.
[64:36.14]Oh, this is bad.
[64:38.72]So many spots.
[64:39.34]It could be literally here.
[64:41.15]It could be anywhere here.
[64:42.43]It could be anywhere here.
[64:43.63]It could be here.
[64:44.79]It could be down here.
[64:46.07]Anywhere in the middle.
[64:47.09]Time for another guess.
[64:49.58]Oh.
[64:49.94]Oh.
[64:51.35]This is bad, guys.
[64:52.45]We're done.
[64:52.89]Alright.
[64:54.09]Jerma.
[64:54.65]Oh, this is bad.
[64:55.29]If he hits it, we're done.
[64:56.73]If he hits either piece except the middle one.
[64:59.07]You're not here.
[65:00.47]I think we're done, guys.
[65:01.57]I have pretty much a one in four chance to hit you, I think.
[65:04.15]Yeah, super high chance.
[65:05.71]One in three.
[65:06.51]Because all you have to do is shoot the middle.
[65:08.83]If he goes for the middle.
[65:10.23]Oh, God.
[65:10.86]50-50.
[65:11.78]Oh, there's only two ways it could go now.
[65:13.34]50-50.
[65:13.70]I think we lose this one, guys.
[65:17.06]Even if we survive one more turn, I have no idea where it would be.
[65:21.26]no I don't do I like show the other side no I don't there's just one I mean there's a really low chance I'll get it even if you miss this one and you'll have it a hundred percent
[65:32.74]That's true.
[65:33.70]We're going down.
[65:35.56]Oh, God.
[65:37.28]Alright.
[65:37.86]Not over yet.
[65:38.36]It is not over yet.
[65:38.90]This is my last turn.
[65:40.14]I have to hit you or it's over.
[65:41.56]Alright.
[65:42.54]Well, this is my last turn anyway.
[65:46.27]This would be the craziest hit of all time.
[65:49.13]The ship D10 and E10.
[65:51.69]If he misses, Jerma will win next turn.
[65:54.29]He has one scan and he has one shot.
[65:57.84]I would have thought it was around here somewhere, but where would he put it?
[66:01.34]It could be... Alright, this is a bad scan, but I'll just try it, I suppose.
[66:06.48]Actually, this is an area I haven't seen.
[66:09.40]Ooh.
[66:11.40]Oh, God.
[66:12.48]I wonder if this leads him right.
[66:14.32]But the thing is, this eliminated multiple spots.
[66:16.75]It can't be here anymore.
[66:17.79]It can't be here.
[66:19.73]It could be anywhere here.
[66:21.97]Could be in this little corner or up here.
[66:24.77]Or here.
[66:26.07]Oh, God, there's so many spots.
[66:29.23]D10 and E10 on your screen right here.
[66:32.96]Guys, we lose.
[66:33.80]I definitely do not envy your position at the very moment.
[66:37.14]There's too many spots for it to be.
[66:39.54]The most likely, just because it can go in three different directions, is right here.
[66:44.63]But that's the thing about Jerma.
[66:46.15]He doesn't operate on what's most likely.
[66:48.77]He operates on monkey brain.
[66:51.29]He sees and he do's.
[66:53.43]And because of that, he's going to be the winner.
[66:56.28]With the all-edge gambit.
[66:58.96]He got good minds.
[67:00.16]It was a good try.
[67:01.28]Wow.
[67:01.60]Wow.
[67:03.08]Oh, man.
[67:03.92]Game one is in Jerma's favor.
[67:06.60]You literally can't mess it up.
[67:08.90]There's only one way it could possibly go.
[67:12.42]It's over, guys.
[67:13.08]We lost.
[67:14.53]Alright, we lost, guys.
[67:15.67]We tried.
[67:16.35]It was a good mine.
[67:18.55]It was very intense.
[67:20.69]Super close.
[67:22.59]Guys, I think we're gonna lose.
[67:24.31]It was on the right.
[67:25.29]It was on the edge.
[67:26.09]It was on the right?
[67:26.89]That's the only other place I could've guessed, but I wasn't... I put them all on the edges.
[67:32.34]Woo!
[67:33.66]Good game, good game.
[67:34.56]That was an excellent game.
[67:35.84]Had me on the edge of my seat.
[67:37.32]Alright, game two, game two.
[67:39.02]I want to just click rematch.
[67:40.04]Probably easy, right?
[67:41.02]Yep.
[67:41.34]I think it's too classic, right?
[67:43.13]And then... Yeah.
[67:44.71]And you can, gentlemen, agree with someone else if you guys want to get crazy, but normally, yeah, too classic than the Fort St.
[67:49.55]Angelo.
[67:49.75]Alright.
[67:50.43]Alright, real quick, checking into our third place match stands.
[67:53.22]Actually, wow!
[68:00.38]What in the fuck is Charlie doing?
[68:03.38]What the shit is that?
[68:05.48]My God, the man's taking mushrooms.
[68:08.38]And he's winning.
[68:09.64]He's literally winning.
[68:12.48]Game two, this is the championship match.
[68:16.94]Sykkuno already has one of his ships hit.
[68:19.04]He went for a very central build.
[68:21.06]You can see right here, he even connected ships.
[68:23.99]I think he understands that Jerma thinks he's analytical and plays really smart, and I think he's hanging on.
[68:29.13]Sykkuno is a guy who forgives but never forgets.
[68:32.17]So when Jerma said, you're not a guy, no, you're not a guy that would place it next to the ship, he took that to heart and he double connected ships here.
[68:40.68]And this could screw him over right now like it screwed over Charlie if he happens to guess in the bottom right.
[68:46.62]He would just get another ship.
[68:48.04]This could screw him over.
[68:49.10]We'll see what happens.
[68:50.20]Jerma's layout, very conventional.
[68:53.44]Very conventional.
[68:54.36]And look, he understands that Sykuno likes doing a bomber.
[68:58.22]He does it on the bottom row, though!
[69:00.44]What a huge hit!
[69:02.10]Oh my god, he was preparing for the first row, but he went for I. Usually, he only goes columns.
[69:08.70]He went row that time.
[69:10.90]And Sykuno throwing on the Phoenix Rite music, he's getting pumped up right now, a bit torqued.
[69:15.43]This is bad, guys.
[69:16.51]I'm hoping you get surprised by the shape.
[69:18.89]But I've got a new strategy that I hope, well, I don't know if it's going to work, but, oh, jeez, I've gotten so lucky with your guesses.
[69:26.43]I'm so dry.
[69:27.48]I'm just surrounding it.
[69:29.18]Yeah, you pretty much have, yeah.
[69:31.22]This has to be up.
[69:32.58]Well, this will tell me if it's the four or the three.
[69:35.44]Oh.
[69:37.39]So it's possibly four, possibly the T. What the fuck?
[69:39.97]It's the T sideways.
[69:41.93]Hmm.
[69:42.75]Wait, let's just see if it's the four.
[69:44.94]Wait, am I still live?
[69:46.18]Multiple direct.
[69:49.06]Okay.
[69:50.10]We're just going to ignore that.
[69:52.12]We are just going to ignore that message.
[69:54.38]That message did not pop up.
[69:56.24]Pretend it wasn't there.
[69:57.76]Everybody, let's just pretend it wasn't there.
[69:59.96]So then you're down here.
[70:03.90]Oh, God.
[70:05.52]Wait, what?
[70:06.84]What?
[70:07.83]Oh, no.
[70:08.97]And, you know, because Jerma is the absolute god of missing the correct hit, he ends up failing to hit the ship correctly.
[70:15.43]But because Sykuno tried to play creatively, he actually connected his ships, screwing him over.
[70:21.37]So, Jerma's going to get two here.
[70:22.79]So, it's an even game.
[70:24.55]This is bad.
[70:26.43]What the hell am I making?
[70:28.20]I'm trying to see what would be combined here.
[70:30.82]This is ignoring the message.
[70:32.60]What are you eating?
[70:34.54]I'm eating poke.
[70:35.64]It's salmon poke.
[70:37.58]It's unlikely he'll shoot in a line of four.
[70:40.41]Wait, what?
[70:41.21]You were close.
[70:42.59]This is so confusing.
[70:43.67]It's super unlikely he'll shoot in a line of four, because I don't have any ships that go forward.
[70:48.43]So that wasted one shot for him.
[70:50.13]Oh, you used your ability.
[70:51.19]Whoa.
[70:52.14]Big turn from Jerma right there.
[70:53.64]Oh, God.
[70:54.18]I don't even like seeing it.
[70:55.32]I hate seeing it.
[70:56.66]Jesus, I hate seeing it.
[70:58.72]Jerma's ship goes up on H3, and then it's a T that extends out H7 and 6.
[71:03.12]There's a lot of different directions it could go.
[71:05.10]I think there is literally only two directions it could go.
[71:07.77]Rather than waste a ton of shots, I'd rather do this.
[71:10.53]Doesn't that not clear anything?
[71:13.07]Oh, no, it could be at the top.
[71:14.09]Which means it has to go to the left or the right.
[71:15.49]Okay, yeah, no, yeah, he's actually smarter than I am.
[71:17.19]Otherwise it would crowd.
[71:18.21]Ooh, bad guesses.
[71:18.85]Wait, what?
[71:19.63]Oh.
[71:19.99]Oh, my God.
[71:21.09]That was lucky of me.
[71:22.49]So that's an impossible combination.
[71:23.99]He probably thought it was the big L going up, which is not possible, because this right here would have been a weird... And this, again, is the Jerm-a-factor.
[71:32.34]It would have been dead.
[71:33.26]He's not really thinking too much about it.
[71:34.76]Alright.
[71:35.48]I think he's just like, what the fuck is this?
[71:38.20]And then just shoot it.
[71:39.55]How is this even possible?
[71:45.77]Oh, this is bad.
[71:47.25]Alright, you a million percent have to know it by now.
[71:49.77]I a million percent would need to know this, but I don't.
[71:52.59]I still don't somehow.
[71:54.44]It is up or down.
[71:55.68]That's the only option you could do that makes any sense in this world.
[71:59.94]I can.
[72:00.66]I can always come back to it.
[72:01.72]But I feel like I need to figure this out so I don't look like an imbecile.
[72:05.02]Jerma, come on.
[72:05.72]You won't.
[72:07.34]You will look like an imbecile.
[72:09.10]I mean, you already beat me once, so... So I just got a cut on there, so I couldn't appreciate you being nice.
[72:13.82]You would look like an imbecile, though.
[72:15.25]There's no combination that can make this.
[72:17.09]I just got a cut on there, so I couldn't appreciate you being nice.
[72:19.09]You would look like an imbecile, though.
[72:20.55]You would.
[72:20.91]For what?
[72:21.79]I know.
[72:22.07]Just wait a second.
[72:22.83]Let me explain.
[72:26.34]Okay.
[72:27.46]There's only one combination that can make the shape, though.
[72:30.01]Because you know for a fact there's no two pieces in there.
[72:33.01]And you know the three is also not in there.
[72:35.31]Because if it was the three and the long like he thought, he thought it was three long, then it would have been... I don't know.
[72:41.90]I don't know.
[72:43.70]That's not even a possible combination.
[72:45.37]My brain can't put it together.
[72:47.33]You're close, I think.
[72:48.61]My brain can't do it.
[72:50.15]That's not even a possible combination.
[72:53.03]He thought it was the Z, but then what would this thing be then?
[72:56.00]It's spun up.
[72:57.74]I don't know.
[72:58.22]I look like an idiot.
[72:59.26]No, no, you're doing fine.
[73:00.30]This was the whole point of combining ships, right?
[73:02.74]I like how Saikudo is nice, but also very logical.
[73:05.24]So he's looking at it and he's being like, what?
[73:07.31]No, that was impossible.
[73:08.25]That was such a bad play.
[73:09.53]And then he'll unmute and be like, yeah, no, that makes sense.
[73:11.69]You're totally fine.
[73:12.35]You're doing great.
[73:12.87]You're doing the best you can.
[73:15.57]That he mutes.
[73:16.63]What?
[73:16.95]What was he even thinking?
[73:17.93]Obviously, mathematically, the ships couldn't have aligned in such a pattern for him to have shot in the past three spots.
[73:22.21]He could have cleared out those ships weeks ago.
[73:26.17]Well, that's bad.
[73:28.24]Alright, you should have it by now.
[73:29.32]Jermis figured it out.
[73:30.80]Mm-hmm.
[73:31.54]Fool him once, shame on you.
[73:34.75]Fool him twice.
[73:36.27]But if you know the next piece, you should know it's a 50% chance.
[73:38.59]That's kind of how it works.
[73:39.81]Fool him three times, well, it's Jermis stream, you know, but fool him four, never mind.
[73:44.01]Hey, guys, we're about to lose.
[73:45.86]Give you a bunch of points.
[73:48.34]We're about to lose again, guys.
[73:50.62]Another scan.
[73:51.40]Good scoop.
[73:52.42]Alright, we're done, guys.
[73:53.52]He's got almost everything.
[73:55.40]We found a couple.
[73:56.18]That misclick is going to hurt.
[73:57.58]Yeah.
[73:59.20]Banned.
[73:59.74]Thanks for the stuff.
[74:00.52]Quick check in on our other game.
[74:01.98]Stanz has lost four of his ships except for his two-piece.
[74:05.52]Charlie, against all odds, is about to lose.
[74:09.81]real quick we're gonna mute up because this is Charlie's last turn right here if Charlie misses this shot the ship is on a four and five he is out twos like touching tips I'm going for it I think you're docking
[74:22.16]Nope.
[74:23.02]I thought so long and hard about docking.
[74:25.52]That's insane.
[74:29.20]Oh, fuck.
[74:29.86]Okay, wait.
[74:30.30]It has to be this, right?
[74:31.22]I might chat.
[74:31.92]Remember that I'm very dumb.
[74:32.80]Game over.
[74:36.16]Stance wins.
[74:36.90]That was good.
[74:38.02]Where was it?
[74:39.86]It was A. If you would have done the A column, you would have just won the game.
[74:43.55]I'm sorry, A row across.
[74:44.79]It was just straight across the top.
[74:47.11]Literally the day one beginners.
[74:49.92]Look at that.
[74:50.40]Alright, so Stance is in third place.
[74:53.03]100 gifted subs goes to Stance.
[74:54.61]One gifted goes to Charlie.
[74:55.65]Let me go take care of that right now.
[74:56.93]Alright.
[74:58.05]Okay.
[74:59.35]Three.
[75:01.01]Well, it's either multiple ships or it's the four.
[75:04.33]And if it's the four, it can't fit in this position on the top right unless... Huh.
[75:11.12]It must be bottom right.
[75:12.38]Bottom right has the hit, I think.
[75:14.38]Oh, you are so close to it, but...
[75:17.19]He has wasted four shots.
[75:19.05]So it has to be bottom right.
[75:20.05]This is the problem with Jerma.
[75:21.71]He's brilliant.
[75:23.15]Brilliant and, and, uh, what's the word that I'm looking for?
[75:27.76]Um, unimitatable.
[75:30.54]Okay?
[75:31.46]Often replicated, never duplicated, once in a lifetime.
[75:35.52]Okay?
[75:36.16]Very, very genius.
[75:37.88]And at the same time, just so, it feels like, um, obtuse.
[75:44.48]Okay.
[75:45.14]There's no way this gets so... What?
[75:47.44]How does every... What?
[75:49.22]Oh, that was already finished.
[75:50.18]Okay.
[75:51.35]Both mines hit.
[75:52.99]Wow.
[75:53.21]The chances of that are so unlikely.
[75:55.17]It's like a less than 1% chance.
[75:57.51]Yeah.
[75:58.05]7 over 100 times 7 over 100.
[75:59.27]Something like that.
[75:59.83]I don't know how to do the math.
[76:01.23]That is quite unlucky.
[76:02.35]Yeah.
[76:02.65]Uh-oh.
[76:03.67]Oh, I already knew that was there, though.
[76:05.19]I've got the four.
[76:05.81]All I have to do is find the twos again.
[76:07.64]That is so unlucky.
[76:08.58]That's legit, like, less than 1% chance of happening.
[76:11.46]I can carve out a significant amount.
[76:13.32]It's just weird that he used four shots like this rather than shooting in the corner, you know, like it... Oh!
[76:21.59]Okay.
[76:21.91]Alright, this should be a win.
[76:24.18]Alright, guys.
[76:25.08]We might be done again.
[76:26.76]He got really good minds.
[76:27.96]Those minds really came in.
[76:29.14]I don't know.
[76:30.26]This is close.
[76:31.24]This is close because... Will Jerma think... Does Jerma think that this two is connecting here?
[76:36.41]Probably not, right?
[76:37.77]This would be so crazy to think that Sykuno connected not only one ship, but two ships.
[76:42.91]And so is he going to get A6, B6?
[76:45.89]I don't think so.
[76:47.09]And not only that, he's going to spend a few turns getting this.
[76:49.41]He's probably going to go up, right, down, then left, knowing Jerma luck.
[76:53.42]And Sykuna, on the other hand, he's already got one ship.
[76:56.64]He's got this one.
[76:57.50]He's just not shooting it off, but he knows where it is.
[76:59.88]This ship is just about dead.
[77:02.04]He's going to shoot here and scan this entire area so he can cover as much as possible.
[77:05.86]Jerma has two ships in this area.
[77:08.06]So he's going to get a four piece from it.
[77:10.28]Luckily, he already threw in a mine, so that'll make things a little bit deceptive.
[77:13.78]But this is not looking amazing.
[77:17.27]Well, the mines must not be in the top, right?
[77:19.01]That's probably the four.
[77:20.21]Okay.
[77:21.11]Up or down?
[77:21.53]50-50.
[77:21.57]50-50.
[77:21.89]Another guess to go for.
[77:24.43]50-50.
[77:25.51]What is it?
[77:27.75]Oh, God.
[77:28.35]We're done, guys.
[77:29.07]This is so bad for us.
[77:30.23]Jerma has four.
[77:31.01]That was a lucky shot.
[77:33.05]With the mine.
[77:33.67]With the mine.
[77:34.19]Not that shot.
[77:34.85]Five to ten straight minutes of this game trying to find you two.
[77:37.30]We're both trying to find you two.
[77:38.22]This two is so hard to find.
[77:40.68]The best strategy he could do is shoot this bottom left corner, clear this entire area.
[77:44.74]Okay, not the total bottom left.
[77:46.36]He should have shot I2 and then scanned it, but fair enough.
[77:50.76]And then he could have scanned this entire area, shot this, shot here.
[77:54.53]He could have cleared basically the entire bottom three, but he instead places a mine.
[77:58.67]Definitely stacking mines here.
[78:00.87]Alright, let's see.
[78:01.29]Which means I must have found something.
[78:03.81]So I could have noticed the location of all five ships.
[78:07.42]You know what this is going to come down to?
[78:09.14]I think it's going to come down to if one of Jerma's mines hits Sykuno's ship.
[78:12.96]Like right now.
[78:14.16]Okay.
[78:14.54]There's no way this mine hits my last ship, right?
[78:18.43]Okay.
[78:19.39]Let's see.
[78:20.29]He's probably going to shoot up, but that's going to be a miss.
[78:23.23]Yeah.
[78:24.33]Probably.
[78:24.99]I know Sykuno's brain.
[78:25.89]It's not up.
[78:26.91]Well, I know where that one is.
[78:28.57]There's just one more two to find.
[78:29.99]It's going to be hard to guess this spot because it's touching another spot.
[78:33.09]We're both in the same boat looking for the two.
[78:35.45]Yeah, pretty much.
[78:37.41]I don't know if using a bomb is the right strat.
[78:39.45]Scanning is way more effective.
[78:42.70]Oh, God.
[78:43.26]You would not connect these two.
[78:45.36]Okay.
[78:45.80]I already have connected once.
[78:47.62]Oh, he's hovering.
[78:48.37]He's hovering in the area.
[78:49.45]Alright.
[78:50.65]This could go either way.
[78:51.77]Ray, thanks for the 20.
[78:52.69]Oh.
[78:52.77]Okay.
[78:56.03]Could go either way, but I do think he has the lead right now.
[78:59.09]There's two mines here.
[79:00.01]This is actually very tricky because Jerma was banking that he would do a William Kars-like bomb throughout the whole area.
[79:06.33]So I think knowing Sykuno, Sykuno's going to shoot D1 because it's a corner or F1.
[79:11.71]I think he'll go D1.
[79:15.19]If I hit a mine, that could give you my last ship.
[79:18.11]Well, let's just go for it.
[79:19.55]What?
[79:20.57]I don't know, guys.
[79:21.01]It's not a bad play.
[79:22.03]I don't know what the plan is here.
[79:23.65]I'm just hoping he doesn't find it.
[79:25.32]I'm afraid to hit a mine because if it hits my last ship, I'm done.
[79:28.98]Okay, so Sykkuno is pretending right now.
[79:30.88]His actual strat is to waste enough turns to gain enough energy points that he can use his superpower and then completely clear the area for...
[79:39.25]through huge bombs or his ult, so that even if he hits a mine and it hits his ship, he guaranteed wins.
[79:45.59]This is a Sykkuno five head strat.
[79:47.99]Well guys, you might be in trouble.
[79:51.45]And he's banking on the fact that this is too difficult of a ship to find.
[79:56.77]So now he has the two by two, so he's gonna drop the two by two, likely in the top left.
[80:01.63]Why would you stack so many mines around one ship?
[80:05.74]This is actually gonna be really bad, though.
[80:07.86]Although a smart strat, he'll know where the ship is.
[80:09.98]Oh, this is gonna be... This is a mine?
[80:12.55]No, this is still fine, though.
[80:15.43]This is actually better for him.
[80:18.11]My guess is either he's a psychopath who stacked every single mine around one ship, or there's two ships around there.
[80:25.04]He's saving for his full power, I think.
[80:27.12]He might be a psychopath, but my guess is... He is a psychopath.
[80:29.12]I gotta try at least to get some info here.
[80:30.74]Okay.
[80:30.96]Alright, he's gonna scan now.
[80:33.20]See, I agree with this scan, but what he did is he used an extra shot.
[80:37.41]Why would you use this shot if you're gonna do this play?
[80:39.85]There's no point.
[80:40.91]It doesn't make any sense.
[80:41.93]There's no reason, but that's Jerma.
[80:43.81]There is no rhyme or reason, and he still gets it done.
[80:46.31]and there's still two inside, which means there's definitely at least one mine.
[80:49.86]But here's my thought.
[80:51.06]Why would you stack so many mines around one two-piece ship?
[80:54.72]And the biggest thing is not a single mine is even near it, because the one shot I've made, it goes out to the right.
[81:00.68]So, you get what I'm saying, right?
[81:02.82]I hear what you're saying.
[81:03.86]I'm not necessarily agreeing or disagreeing with what you're saying.
[81:06.99]I do hear you, though.
[81:08.17]I hear what you're saying.
[81:09.27]Alright, I'm thinking this is it.
[81:11.17]Because... No, he's gonna go F1.
[81:12.81]You stacked a bunch of mines, but they're not connected to the one ship I've hit.
[81:16.24]Which means, you either predicted I'd scan there, and hoped I'd guess wrong every time, or I detected two ships already.
[81:23.39]And if I detected two ships already, then there's one right there!
[81:26.71]I knew it!
[81:29.71]There's no way you would stack so many mines there if there was only one ship there because none of them are even connected.
[81:36.63]He's brilliant!
[81:38.33]So it had to be in that spot.
[81:40.03]The last one's right here.
[81:41.16]The T-shape's there and the four's in the top right.
[81:44.06]We're going to game three, ladies and gentlemen.
[81:46.26]Oh my god, it makes so much sense.
[81:48.34]My god!
[81:49.94]It's the greatest game of Battleship I've ever seen!
[81:52.34]Mines down the entire left corner.
[81:54.38]Oh my god, just speedrun it.
[81:56.21]Speedrun it.
[81:56.57]Speedrun it, man.
[81:58.27]We have to finish this.
[81:59.05]That last one was so intense.
[82:13.86]Alright, we're going to do a crazy map?
[82:15.16]Alright, yeah, yeah.
[82:16.30]I'll make it.
[82:16.74]I'll make it.
[82:18.64]Fort St.
[82:19.26]Angelo, right?
[82:22.06]4-7-7-0.
[82:22.28]4-7-7-0.
[82:22.58]That was good, guys.
[82:25.00]I turned on the music because I was certain about my theory.
[82:28.06]Well, not certain.
[82:30.25]Oh, wait.
[82:30.87]I'm unmuted.
[82:32.25]That's awkward.
[82:33.75]I had a crazy theory, though.
[82:35.29]Like, none of your mines were connected to your ship.
[82:37.87]Usually, you'd connect a mine to a ship to make it look, you know, when you guess wrong, you get punished.
[82:43.27]But since none of them were connected, I figured I had to have found two in there.
[82:46.33]He said Zertan confirmed Jerma fan.
[82:48.63]Sykuno places ships pretty well, actually.
[82:52.27]I like this two-piece jutting out.
[82:53.59]I like the two-piece at the top.
[82:55.17]The T's in a pretty good spot.
[82:56.67]This four-piece is pretty good.
[82:59.61]And Jerma, on the other hand, placed his ships...
[83:03.93]That's actually pretty good.
[83:04.92]I actually think having the... I was going to say the one in there is kind of good, but immediately discovered.
[83:11.10]This might be a little bit difficult to find out that it's a T-ship, though.
[83:14.86]It's not too bad.
[83:15.68]This is the final game of the tournament.
[83:18.52]What?
[83:19.62]Oh.
[83:21.18]Okay.
[83:21.72]What ship could this be?
[83:23.94]Could be the T in a lot of directions.
[83:25.82]I probably shouldn't tell you that.
[83:27.10]This is the T. Oh, man.
[83:29.24]I got you with the T right here.
[83:30.58]oh you got it you've fully gotten it there's no other way you could face now this has been a good softy he always helps out and again I'm just gonna guess alright oh what oh Jesus alright well if it's this one it must go to the right then the only question is which ship is it maybe the four
[83:49.13]It's the four or the T. By shooting up or down, I'll determine if it's the T.
[83:54.65]100% the T. Alright.
[83:56.73]Let's move up here.
[83:59.11]Does anyone else feel like they're watching Olympic-level Battleship right now for no goddamn reason?
[84:03.87]When did this start happening?
[84:05.03]Two.
[84:05.83]You got two somewhere up there.
[84:08.20]Oh, God.
[84:09.26]Alright, this is your four or your three?
[84:13.03]Yep.
[84:13.81]Let's go for four.
[84:16.19]Oh, God.
[84:16.51]This is your four.
[84:17.67]Mm-hmm.
[84:17.93]There's two ways it could go, though.
[84:18.93]I got one chance here, left or right.
[84:19.86]I'm going left.
[84:20.64]Mm-hmm.
[84:21.74]Oh, God.
[84:22.68]Okay.
[84:23.04]Alright, well, you know what it is now.
[84:24.74]Jerma has two ships guaranteed.
[84:26.48]Sykkuno has one ship guaranteed.
[84:27.96]That's a great spot.
[84:28.98]That's going to hit.
[84:29.62]It's going to hit his four-piece.
[84:31.46]That's the full.
[84:33.54]Yeah, and there's no way it can go.
[84:35.07]There's no way it can go.
[84:36.13]This is guaranteed.
[84:37.25]It could be the three going down.
[84:38.63]Might potentially be.
[84:40.57]It's the four, which means I found it.
[84:42.69]Why did it sound like Jerma was trying to convince himself?
[84:45.57]Maybe it could be the three.
[84:48.41]Maybe.
[84:48.93]Please guess in a different spot.
[84:50.89]I guess.
[84:52.09]I don't know.
[84:52.81]It's up to you, I suppose.
[84:54.27]That scan's going to find something, but there's no worse couple than Jerma.
[85:03.68]What?
[85:04.70]He just full-on killed it.
[85:05.88]I was going to say there's no worse couple than Jerma in a one scan, but he just banks it.
[85:10.64]Yeah, this is quite bad for me.
[85:14.02]The problem is he has two two-ships left.
[85:16.99]I've got the four.
[85:17.91]Sykunos has the four.
[85:19.07]He knows that.
[85:19.65]Something else is up here.
[85:21.17]Something else is up there.
[85:22.23]What?
[85:23.61]It's actually going to be to the bottom.
[85:25.80]E1 and 2, and it's a three-piece going down.
[85:28.54]E1, F1, E2.
[85:30.32]Wait.
[85:31.48]I swear to God, if Jerma created the battleship meta, convinced me to run a battleship tournament, I put a bunch of money on it, and then he wins the entire event?
[85:41.61]Alright.
[85:42.39]I'm just going to go with my next best guess here.
[85:46.35]Nope.
[85:47.41]I think he'll get the next one.
[85:48.21]Alright, next turn I have enough energy for the ultimate if he hits anything.
[85:51.53]I think that ship is really good, that E3, E4 ship.
[85:55.37]Really good.
[85:57.03]Okay.
[85:58.35]He's gonna go top right.
[85:59.51]Oh, it's nothing but whiffs if he goes top right.
[86:01.67]Alright, I have a thought.
[86:03.93]Last time I connected ships, you got really confused.
[86:07.92]It wouldn't make any sense for you to do this though.
[86:10.90]Oh yeah, it didn't.
[86:13.99]Alright, so that was right next to the four.
[86:16.11]He did earn all the money back he lost for me.
[86:18.01]That is true.
[86:19.05]Oh, I guessed everything wrong, but the worst.
[86:21.47]Oh man, this is... He's decorating it.
[86:25.57]He should throw a scan.
[86:26.11]I noticed he's shooting diagonally.
[86:27.63]He might hit that one.
[86:28.37]I think he'll throw a scan.
[86:29.13]So this is the last spot it has to hit.
[86:30.86]And the fact that that's connected means it's either a three-piece aimed down, two-piece aimed up.
[86:36.99]That's right.
[86:37.97]Probably better to go for the three-piece, because the three-piece also contains the two-piece.
[86:41.37]Let's try this.
[86:42.47]Okay.
[86:42.93]Right, mathematically, each is better.
[86:44.37]It could just be two also.
[86:46.11]Yeah, it could be.
[86:47.65]Alright, I gotta go for this.
[86:48.75]This is gonna give me the most info.
[86:52.14]Oh, jeez.
[86:52.94]Wow.
[86:53.76]Gave you a lot of something.
[86:56.84]Alright.
[86:57.72]Wow.
[86:59.13]Oh, and he just hits the mine.
[87:00.41]Spot on.
[87:01.54]I noticed you were shooting diagonally.
[87:03.74]You're doing a checkerboard pattern, I think.
[87:05.92]So following your pattern, I placed a mine right there.
[87:08.28]He's so smart, but he's also so stupid because he gives up his strat.
[87:13.88]I just get lucky sometimes.
[87:14.96]That was such a big brain play.
[87:18.25]It's like he's brilliant, but then he's also like this is what I'm doing and then you're like, okay I'm just gonna stop doing that now, but thanks for letting me know It's like in movies when the supervillain explains his exact plan.
[87:31.22]It's like Dr.. Doofenshmirtz.
[87:32.87]Yeah
[87:34.75]Wow, look, they both do the same exact strat.
[87:36.91]Alright.
[87:37.51]No, don't click there.
[87:38.39]There's no reason to click there.
[87:39.71]You know where it is.
[87:40.35]It has to be to the right.
[87:41.79]I guess he doesn't care, though, because it's guaranteed.
[87:44.04]Let's see if it's a three.
[87:45.68]Why?
[87:46.60]I guess I understand that.
[87:47.56]That makes sense.
[87:48.50]He doesn't want to give him the points.
[87:49.76]That makes sense.
[87:51.16]Could be a two or it could be three the other way.
[87:53.88]Oh, top right corner.
[87:55.16]That doesn't make sense.
[87:56.31]That's a bad shot because he could have shot right underneath and covered both.
[87:59.23]Like to be honestly, because that would make you crazy.
[88:01.41]You probably never guess it's there.
[88:03.13]Oh man, we got to speed run this.
[88:05.17]Mine.
[88:06.21]This will tell me if it's the three or the two.
[88:08.48]It's most definitely the three then.
[88:09.86]So I found the three, found the T, found the four.
[88:12.48]All I have to do is find the last one.
[88:14.06]His remaining ship is in the top right corner in the bottom right corner.
[88:17.70]Really hard ships to find for Sykkuno.
[88:19.86]Really hard.
[88:20.66]And if he shoots right here.
[88:21.76]Actually, you have two twos left.
[88:25.88]Okay.
[88:26.62]Oh man.
[88:27.50]And then based on the rest of the placements.
[88:30.00]No.
[88:30.27]No.
[88:32.93]What?
[88:33.83]What?
[88:35.57]Oh.
[88:37.89]Oh, but you don't know what way they go.
[88:40.43]Um, that's possibly true.
[88:42.47]But I was just looking at the current placements of your ships, and I think I've got most of it.
[88:47.41]Alright, here's what I've got so far.
[88:49.39]This is the three.
[88:51.97]He put on the superhero music!
[88:53.79]Because it'd be smarter to wait till next turn.
[88:56.74]But here's the thing.
[88:58.26]It'll look much cooler if I get it all this turn.
[89:00.50]There's the T.
[89:02.30]Alright.
[89:04.50]Now I've got the four right here.
[89:05.86]100%.
[89:06.24]All the Power Rangers are here.
[89:08.28]They're all ready.
[89:09.08]I'm being surrounded.
[89:10.64]I'm like Rita Repulsa.
[89:11.89]You're about to eliminate me.
[89:12.81]You're going to send me back to the shadow world.
[89:14.57]I somehow doubt you would have put this like this.
[89:17.75]This one must be at the top because it'd be weird to line it up like that.
[89:21.27]Oh my god!
[89:22.50]Alright.
[89:24.62]Well, here's the last thing you have to remember.
[89:26.62]This looks like a 50% chance.
[89:29.01]But I... Actually, it might be.
[89:31.35]Let's do this.
[89:33.26]It's a 50.
[89:35.56]Oh, my God!
[89:36.88]It's 100% chance now.
[89:38.80]Jesus!
[89:40.27]I got it!
[89:41.19]What the hell?
[89:42.63]Oh, my God.
[89:43.99]I got it.
[89:45.17]Oh, jeez.
[89:46.83]Oh, so lucky.
[89:48.59]No, it wasn't!
[89:49.03]I can't believe how lucky I got.
[89:50.91]I did it.
[89:52.07]That was such a close game.
[89:54.49]Every single game was super close.
[89:56.69]Yeah, that was awesome.
[89:58.13]Oh, my God.
[90:02.08]Uh, congratulations, Sykkuno.
[90:04.37]What a last turn that was.
[90:06.40]That was amazing.
[90:07.32]My god.
[90:07.94]There's a little bit of guessing, but, you know, it's cooler to get it on that turn than do the safe thing and just get it next turn.
[90:14.34]Yeah.
[90:15.18]Yeah, I suppose.
[90:15.90]He's just feeding me points, and he's just like, I'm gonna get it.
[90:18.66]I'm just like, oh, no.
[90:19.40]It's like the guy that called his dad, who wants to be a millionaire, and just said, hey, I don't need your help to win the million dollars.
[90:24.85]Yeah.
[90:25.99]I just thought it's cooler if I actually get it, you know?
[90:28.09]He just fucking styled on you as well.
[90:29.89]Dude, he stunted.
[90:30.55]That was amazing.
[90:31.45]I just got lucky, guys.
[90:32.41]I just got lucky.
[90:33.17]I had...
[90:34.57]Well, to round it out, it's 300 gifted for you, Sykuno, 200 gifted for you, Jerma, 100 gifted for you, Charlie, and a soul gift.
[90:43.74]Oh, excuse me.
[90:44.16]100 gifted for Santa and a soul gift for Charlie.
[90:45.52]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[90:46.00]You had it right the first time.
[90:48.31]Yeah, give Charlie 100.
[90:49.07]You better do it.
[90:50.31]Yeah.
[90:51.57]Our games were so close.
[90:52.77]I think we both did.
[90:53.23]They were.
[90:53.91]Yes.
[90:54.67]Dude, I tuned in.
[90:55.81]I tuned in.
[90:56.35]Super fun.
[90:57.37]Oh yeah, just a second, I know you got a dip.
[90:59.04]You got a dip.
[90:59.68]Thanks for playing, brother.
[91:00.90]But thanks so much, guys.
[91:01.98]I appreciate it.
[91:03.12]It was great meeting you, Jerma.
[91:05.16]Great playing.
[91:05.58]We'll play again sometime.
[91:07.08]Yeah, for sure.
[91:08.14]See you guys later.
[91:08.80]I'm gonna hold you to that.
[91:10.60]Yo, I will say his battleship skill, unbeatable.
[91:13.34]His outros, bottom tier.
[91:17.52]He's not here to take the podium for first.
[91:19.30]That means I can get it.
[91:20.28]I can get the medal, right?
[91:21.06]That is right.
[91:21.64]That's how it works.
[91:22.89]Legally binding.
[91:23.73]He's actually going to be moved to fourth place.
[91:26.15]Oh, very good.
[91:28.73]Jerma, I don't know what your master plan was, but you've convinced me not only to run this tournament, but that you were bad at Battleship and then to give you $1,000.
[91:35.27]So I got to say congrats on that.
[91:39.03]I'm telling you, that second game tactic, I couldn't figure it out.
[91:43.23]My brain just couldn't do it.
[91:44.69]Yeah.
[91:45.65]I think it was very tricky, but it was funny to see.
[91:48.47]Even when I got to the last possible place, I'm just like, my brain was trying to piece it together.
[91:52.56]I was like, how does this go together?
[91:53.56]Yeah.
[91:54.12]Oh, was that the two two-by-ones together?
[91:57.06]He got his Tetris piece, and he had his big six piece.
[92:00.46]They were connected.
[92:01.06]Oh, touching each other.
[92:01.78]Yeah.
[92:03.36]And he had hit both, but he could not, for the life of him, figure out how to do it.
[92:06.55]He just couldn't figure it out.
[92:08.23]Uh...
[92:08.85]Well, anyway, gentlemen, thank you so much for doing it.
[92:11.01]Sorry the first time went super long.
[92:12.59]This day, I think, went a lot better.
[92:14.43]Jerma, you ever play Widget?
[92:16.05]Widget?
[92:17.01]Widget.
[92:18.80]Do you know who that is?
[92:19.50]Who's the TikToker?
[92:21.16]No, I don't know.
[92:21.82]Is this a TikTok thing?
[92:23.54]No, Widget, it's a very fun game.
[92:24.98]It's Prop Hunt, but it's with... Yeah, it's like a standalone Prop Hunt.
[92:28.78]Yeah, we should do this with Prop.
[92:30.14]We should do this with Widget.
[92:30.86]It's the best game ever made.
[92:32.08]Wait, like a tournament?
[92:33.46]Yeah, just like this with Widget.
[92:34.47]It'd be so fun.
[92:35.15]How?
[92:35.77]Well, you just do two-by-twos or whatever.
[92:37.73]We could do teams.
[92:38.71]Are you doing the thing that I did like three, four weeks ago where I just said, let's do a battleship meta?
[92:42.93]Yeah, and then I hope one week we'll just run out of this.
[92:45.09]Why are you talking to Jerma like I'm the guy?
[92:47.31]Because you like Jerma, and if Jerma goes witch it, that's a great idea, then you'll do it.
[92:51.30]That's a good point.
[92:52.68]If Jerma asked you to do it, you would do it.
[92:55.16]That is pretty true.
[92:56.16]Jerma, you don't like it, right?
[92:58.12]You prefer...
[92:59.36]I gotta take a look at it.
[93:00.45]You gotta take a look.
[93:01.71]It's a good game.
[93:03.01]Yeah, I suppose you do have to take a look.
[93:06.10]I do suppose that is how that functions.
[93:09.32]But no, this was fun.
[93:10.23]I think setting up something else would be great.
[93:11.75]I think just doing random events with everyone in random tournaments is a great time.
[93:14.39]Alright, guys.
[93:16.06]Thank you so much.
[93:16.90]Jerma, I'll see you in the dollhouse in a few weeks.
[93:19.98]Oh, yeah.
[93:21.33]See you at the dollhouse.
[93:22.39]It's gonna be fun.
[93:23.05]Looking forward to it.
