[ve:60.16.100]

[00:35.50]Hey, what's up?
[00:36.20]How's it going?
[00:36.62]We missed you.
[00:37.16]I was live yesterday.
[00:38.44]Wasn't gone for very long.
[00:39.38]How's it going?
[00:39.98]You quiet?
[00:40.24]Huh?
[00:40.34]Shouldn't nothing change.
[00:41.04]I mean, I might be talking lower.
[01:03.49]Not screaming and yelling like I was yesterday.
[01:05.39]Yesterday was a wild one.
[01:08.09]I'm going to slow it down today.
[01:13.51]Play some Trapang.
[01:14.52]Am I saying Trapang 2?
[01:17.16]Is it Trapang 2?
[01:18.36]Trapang 2?
[01:20.78]Trapang 2.
[01:25.36]Is there a Trapang 1?
[01:28.02]I played the demo a long time ago.
[01:30.70]Back, what, like six months ago?
[01:34.76]Is there a trip hang one?
[01:42.34]The demo was crazy.
[01:43.96]The demo was a lot of fun, so I said when it came out I was going to play it and.
[01:48.06]Here it is.
[01:48.42]It's out.
[01:55.04]What do you mean the game is quite violent?
[01:59.78]This game is quite violent.
[02:02.52]That's pretty much all I need to say.
[02:06.59]I think it's pretty bloody.
[02:08.53]It's a violent game.
[02:12.63]If I remember the demo... The demo was outrageous.
[02:18.76]It's like fear.
[02:22.56]Yeah, I played the demo.
[02:28.44]How the sunflowers.
[02:29.12]We're gonna go over a few things.
[02:30.22]I did say that I wanted to show the sunflowers today, but... Sorry.
[02:35.61]Not gonna show them today.
[02:36.49]I know people were waiting for this.
[02:39.01]I said Sunday was gonna be the sunflower day, but... I want to make sure these photos look really good.
[02:46.84]Holly and I want to edit them, make them look nice.
[02:49.88]And I don't just want to throw up a random shit picture.
[02:53.16]Like, oh yeah, like, oh, this one and this one.
[02:55.37]No, we're going to curate them.
[02:56.29]We're going to make them look really nice.
[02:58.29]And then we're going to present them.
[03:03.65]I'm also going to go over the House Flipper lineup of streamers.
[03:10.41]That stream is going to be really fun.
[03:12.28]Looking forward to it.
[03:16.09]Tuesday at 1 o'clock Pacific.
[03:20.37]Doing a stream.
[03:22.87]Where I get.
[03:24.37]Tentatively.
[03:25.23]Because still there's maybe one or two people on this list that.
[03:29.09]You know, depending on scheduling stuff.
[03:31.75]Some people have stuff to do.
[03:35.01]But we'll see.
[03:35.67]I think it's going to be probably 10 to 12 people.
[03:40.00]Can you talk faster?
[03:43.76]No, I don't.
[03:45.08]No.
[03:48.89]Tentative Andy.
[03:53.39]Is Ster doing it?
[03:55.53]I don't know.
[03:55.89]Ster just might be there and just do one.
[03:58.85]I don't know.
[03:59.81]We don't have a formal agreement that Ster is actually making a house on Tuesday.
[04:04.85]He can.
[04:05.33]He's more than welcome to, right?
[04:06.81]Like I said yesterday.
[04:11.15]He's been formally invited and then formally uninvited and then formally invited again.
[04:16.04]So, yeah, if he wants to do it, he can.
[04:21.26]Do you think that you will take over the world one day?
[04:23.18]No.
[04:23.44]No, God, no.
[04:27.32]No.
[04:35.19]No.
[04:39.39]If I take over the world, you mean, like, have my own little farm somewhere?
[04:43.19]And, like, raise chickens and goats and shit.
[04:49.41]Then, yeah.
[04:50.21]Then, yeah.
[04:59.04]That sounds nice.
[05:01.22]Like Thanos.
[05:04.18]Yeah, guys, like Thanos.
[05:06.80]No other person in any country, in any form of media, no other person has had a farm before.
[05:15.89]Just Thanos.
[05:16.91]Just the guy that snapped out humanity.
[05:19.49]Only Thanos has done that.
[05:22.53]Nobody else has ever done that.
[05:30.75]Why do you quote him every five seconds?
[05:35.21]I need to correct the record here.
[05:40.18]Maybe back in like 2019 or something, 2020.
[05:45.08]Maybe like 2021.
[05:48.36]When Endgame was really relevant, right?
[05:50.52]Like, oh, whatever.
[05:51.18]I don't even know what year that movie came out in.
[05:59.49]So you did.
[06:04.77]Remember, you reference Endgame for like five years straight.
[06:10.45]So?
[06:12.19]It was a big piece of media.
[06:14.47]That movie made like five trillion dollars, okay?
[06:17.85]I'm gonna reference the popular media that comes out.
[06:29.90]It's like World of Warcraft.
[06:33.76]Yeah, I referenced World of Warcraft a lot.
[06:36.56]It was a major, major part of my life, and it was like a cultural phenomenon.
[06:42.86]I'm going to reference it sometime, and I can already see the Batchesters, and that's fine.
[06:47.90]That's fine.
[06:50.45]But anyways, yeah.
[06:51.47]If you want to go over the list, I want to get this out of the way so we can just play and hang out.
[06:55.99]It's going to be a chill night.
[06:57.23]I'm going to hang out and play for a little while.
[07:01.99]Okay, so the tentative list for the House Flipper Invitational.
[07:05.88]It's just me.
[07:07.36]Nobody's involved.
[07:08.06]It's just me.
[07:14.85]Let's go over how this is going to work.
[07:17.23]I have to stall, right?
[07:22.35]Each one of these people that I'm going to say right now on Tuesday at 1 o'clock at the same time are all going to start making a house.
[07:34.84]They're using the same house.
[07:37.20]It's the same template.
[07:38.80]They will not know what house it is until Tuesday at 1.
[07:43.77]So there's not going to be a scenario where it's like, oh, it's this house.
[07:46.23]I'm not going to give them any opportunity.
[07:52.05]This list is a bunch of friends.
[07:53.25]Some people that you've recognized for years.
[07:57.41]Maybe a couple of new faces you haven't seen on this channel.
[08:01.41]Hmm.
[08:03.25]Maybe.
[08:06.52]Friends, friends, friends.
[08:07.98]He has friends.
[08:10.20]Yeah, I got friends.
[08:10.94]Okay, here we go.
[08:17.22]We got Joel.
[08:20.24]Vinesauce Joel.
[08:22.59]Looking forward to what Joel is going to come up with.
[08:26.29]We've got Sea Dog.
[08:29.25]Sea Dog.
[08:32.37]RT Game.
[08:34.39]RT.
[08:36.93]Vinny Vinesauce.
[08:41.95]Poke.
[08:43.25]Poke will be joining us.
[08:47.35]Ludwig.
[08:47.85]Ludwig.
[08:49.32]Ludwig.
[08:52.56]DougDoug Etalyx Etalyx is joining us on this stream and ConnorEatsPants those are the those are the that's the tentative list possible one or two may be added still trying to figure it out but it's gonna that's gonna be a hell of a stream
[09:28.08]dream blunt rotation.
[09:38.46]The other thing, too, is that I was thinking about, OK, who who do I think who do I know that would actually want to do this?
[09:44.55]I asked all my friends, obviously.
[09:47.07]But the other thing is.
[09:49.71]I don't want it to be too many people.
[09:51.89]Because if it gets to be like 15, 20 different people, it's like, oh, you all have to give me tours of your fucking house.
[10:01.00]We'll be here for like seven hours.
[10:07.18]But yeah, I think there might be another one or two people added.
[10:10.29]Maybe somebody is like, yo, I can't do it on Tuesday.
[10:12.67]It's all good.
[10:14.39]That's the tentative list.
[10:16.53]Still waiting on one or two confirmations.
[10:26.39]What is the prize for the winner?
[10:28.72]Abso-fucking-lutely nothing.
[10:32.08]Absolutely zero.
[10:34.48]Nothing.
[10:37.45]But... Here's the thing.
[10:46.92]They're going to be graded.
[10:50.95]It's not just, oh, make a house and whatever.
[10:52.99]And all these grades are just, the grades are absolute horseshit, guys.
[10:57.09]Alright, this is not a real competition.
[10:59.33]Can I, I gotta make that really clear.
[11:01.15]This is not a real competition.
[11:03.53]We're just gonna fuck around for a few hours.
[11:05.09]You know, this is not a real competition.
[11:08.07]But if you want to know what you're gonna be graded on, I put a lot of thought into this, contrary to popular belief.
[11:20.26]The grading system... Let's turn this down.
[11:24.24]This is loud.
[11:25.04]Let's turn this down.
[11:27.74]Sorry, that was so loud.
[11:29.32]The grading system is going to be as follows.
[11:31.28]It's going to be weighted.
[11:32.14]A 100 point scale.
[11:35.40]From A plus to F. F is always 55 points.
[11:38.96]You cannot go below 55 points in a certain category.
[11:44.28]Creativity is worth 35%.
[11:46.82]Complexity and structure is worth 25%.
[11:49.65]Cleanliness is worth 15%.
[11:51.91]And philosophy is worth 15%.
[11:53.67]Now you're probably wondering, that does not make 100%, Jeremy.
[11:57.27]Well, that's where you come in.
[12:01.95]Chat's grade is going to be worth 10%.
[12:03.64]Because I know, like Ster said, the person that makes the auto house, some of you guys are probably going to give an A+.
[12:16.48]But I want to be the one that decides.
[12:19.68]What are you going to be doing while they're making their houses?
[12:22.98]That's a great question.
[12:25.19]I haven't figured that out yet.
[12:28.29]It's only going to be like 60 to 80 minutes.
[12:31.43]So, I don't know.
[12:32.87]It's possible.
[12:33.45]Maybe I'll just jump around and look and see what people are doing.
[12:36.06]I'll do browser games.
[12:37.46]Okay.
[12:42.61]But yeah, everyone's gonna have a slot, so people are gonna have about five to ten minutes to do a tour.
[12:49.17]And this is where it can get pretty bloated, right?
[12:51.06]If, if, this is, I'm trying to think of, okay, who, who can I invite?
[12:54.54]I don't want to, and just, and I don't want to invite a bunch of people and then have to take it back, because it's like, oh shit, actually, I invited too many people, uh...
[13:03.50]And you know me.
[13:04.08]I don't really fucking know anybody anyways.
[13:06.26]I know very... My circle on Twitch and in the content creator world is actually fairly small.
[13:14.07]So, you know, I try to include as many people as I can, if I can.
[13:21.71]But yeah, it's going to be a fun day.
[13:26.79]You're actually lying?
[13:28.32]Wait, what?
[13:36.20]This stream is not happening?
[13:39.75]No, what?
[13:40.23]This stream is happening.
[13:41.45]I've... I got a whole document about this stream, okay?
[13:47.71]But anyways, yeah.
[13:50.82]We're gonna grade.
[13:51.74]Well, I'm gonna grade, and then you're gonna give the ending grade.
[13:55.90]And whoever wins and loses, it doesn't matter.
[13:58.24]It's all for fun anyways.
[13:59.48]This whole thing is for fun.
[14:01.61]I made sure to tell everybody, like, hey, this whole thing is just horseshit.
[14:05.17]Just everybody should know that.
[14:13.78]They're talking about how you promised to finish Breath of the Wild.
[14:18.52]Oh, they're talking about something else.
[14:21.93]You're wasting everybody's time?
[14:24.83]What?
[14:25.15]You can't just have fun?
[14:26.33]Not everything has to... What do you mean?
[14:28.35]We can't just have...
[14:29.89]Alright, that's a bait comment.
[14:31.97]That's a bait comment.
[14:43.25]You didn't even let me trickle in first.
[14:46.23]Well, it's been like 15 minutes.
[14:50.96]Yeah, should be fun.
[14:53.17]And again, that list might grow by one or two.
[14:55.23]It might also reduce by one.
[14:57.43]Like I said, but that's just a tentative list.
[14:59.66]I wanted to wait to tell everybody that because give people time to figure out if they can do it or not.
[15:05.54]Yeah, we'll see.
[15:07.14]We will see.
[15:07.60]It's gonna be fun.
[15:20.06]What the fuck are the stream tags?
[15:21.98]I have not typed in a stream tag.
[15:24.75]Ever.
[15:25.89]So, whatever's there, I don't know.
[15:27.65]I didn't even do it.
[15:28.75]One of the mods just did it, like, to fuck with me.
[15:33.83]You should delete them?
[15:34.95]I- Honestly, I don't even care enough to delete them.
[15:38.54]Is that- You know what I mean?
[15:39.80]I- I could go over here right now to the dashboard, because on my other monitor I have my dashboard.
[15:45.48]And I can- I'm hovering over one of the X's for tournament arc.
[15:49.56]I could click the X right now.
[15:50.98]I could do it right now.
[15:53.10]But the effort to click that X is... That's just not enough in here.
[15:57.81]I mean, I just don't even... You know?
[15:59.93]I just can't do it.
[16:02.49]I just... I don't care.
[16:08.14]But of the people that I mentioned there, I'm very curious as to, because there's one of two ways to take that stream on Tuesday.
[16:15.76]And that's going all in and doing house additions and putting up custom wallpaper and shit and doing a full redecoration of the house.
[16:25.95]And then there's like, I imagine some of them just going to put like a nice couch in a living room and like put a painting up and maybe not even paint the walls and just be like, hey, what do you think?
[16:34.87]It's going to, I'm very, very excited about this.
[16:38.92]I think this is going to be really, really fun.
[16:47.17]Last time Ludwig tried.
[16:49.13]Ludwig, I'm... I don't know if I would... I think Ludwig's going to make a pretty good one.
[16:58.36]Ludwig has experience.
[17:00.74]Because if you don't... We did this on Ludwig's Bros vs. Bros.
[17:06.50]Bro vs. Bro.
[17:09.45]So Ludwig has experience.
[17:12.21]Conrade's Pants also has experience because he was the one that graded it last time.
[17:15.91]And there's also a lot of people on this list have played a lot of House Flipper.
[17:22.17]That was part of my decision too, was have they played this before?
[17:26.47]Hmm.
[17:27.91]There are some House Flipper veterans that are on this list.
[17:33.35]When is this Tuesday at 1 p.m.
[17:36.65]Pacific?
[17:46.68]Are you gonna make a house?
[17:48.62]I don't, I don't know.
[17:49.50]I might just mess around in House Flipper for like the 60 to 80 minutes that people make a house.
[17:56.49]Yeah.
[17:59.61]What the fuck is a Tuesday?
[18:13.16]Alright, you guys ready?
[18:14.90]Let's play.
[18:16.26]Gonna be just hanging out, playing the game.
[18:20.12]Yesterday was kind of wild.
[18:21.61]I'm gonna dial it back a little today.
[18:25.07]What about Ster?
[18:26.29]Ster, that's what I mean by there's still a few people that I'm not sure if they're gonna do it or not.
[18:30.73]Ster is just one of them.
[18:31.58]Ster might just jump into the Discord call and just be like, hey, I made one.
[18:36.28]And he's like, okay, well, I'm gonna grade it.
[18:46.02]You starting at 1 p.m.
[18:46.97]on a Tuesday is never going to happen.
[18:49.09]Well, when there's 11 to 14 different streamers that are going to all be there at that time, I better fucking be there because it's my event.
[18:59.68]So if I'm not there, that's a big problem.
[19:02.80]That would be bad.
[19:03.68]So I have to be there at 1 p.m.
[19:06.49]Pacific time.
[19:09.43]When like 10 to 15, like it's going to be like probably 12, maybe 11.
[19:13.26]It might be 14 though.
[19:14.20]It might be like 15.
[19:14.74]I don't know.
[19:15.50]It's going to be, it's going to be a lot of people.
[19:18.58]You're going to be late to your own event.
[19:24.81]Yeah.
[19:26.19]Ster's house could be the waiting house while you're waiting for other streamers.
[19:29.76]That's actually not a bad idea.
[19:34.53]Am I going to have to send a DM to Ster to do another Five Nights at Freddy's stream?
[19:40.88]Where he just Discord shares me.
[19:43.52]Him making a house for like an hour.
[19:44.88]And he's not even being graded on it.
[19:46.23]We just like watch him play the game.
[19:51.85]And then he'll just leave.
[19:53.39]He'll just leave after that.
[19:54.57]He'll be like, alright, I'm out of here.
[19:55.89]And he'll just leave the call.
[19:56.73]He doesn't even care to be like a part of the festivities.
[20:08.74]So you're not even streaming the- oh no, yes, I am, I am.
[20:12.82]So how it's gonna play out is, after the hour goes by, each person is gonna have a- about a seven minute time slot, and they're going to share to me their screen, and we are going to go through a tour, they're gonna give me a full tour, and I'm gonna be taking notes.
[20:35.41]stalling well I mean this is an important stall this is a this is this is this is the big House Flipper event I've been talking about the last few weeks I think it's an important stall this game can be pretty loud even if you lower the volume that is great for me to know because I will drop it even further thank you alright let's go
[21:03.26]Tripang 2.
[21:05.38]Here it is.
[21:09.06]New game.
[21:09.48]Uh... I'm not picking rage mode.
[21:15.44]Hold on.
[21:15.82]What is this?
[21:16.30]Easy?
[21:17.26]Have some casual fun.
[21:18.66]We won't judge.
[21:19.77]Oh.
[21:20.83]Recommended difficulty for players who occasionally play FPS games.
[21:24.73]Recommended for experienced FPS players looking for a challenge.
[21:29.13]What about experienced FPS players that are not looking for a challenge?
[21:34.12]How come there's not a normal plus?
[21:38.84]Punishingly difficult.
[21:39.84]You will die a lot.
[21:42.55]Ridiculously difficult.
[21:43.85]Expert mastery of the game's mechanics and exploits are required to play on this difficulty.
[21:49.05]And then enemies have eyes in the back of their heads.
[21:51.83]Instant reaction times and near perfect accuracy.
[21:55.67]Only some kind of sick and twisted person could enjoy this.
[21:58.61]I'm just playing on normal.
[22:01.43]I don't care.
[22:05.34]The hell?
[22:05.66]Alright.
[22:14.90]Double headphones going in.
[22:22.13]Normal.
[22:22.79]Omega low.
[22:25.83]Yeah, that's fine though.
[22:29.17]I've said this before.
[22:30.12]When you're over 35, you can pick normal.
[22:32.06]It's fine.
[22:33.19]You can pick normal even if you- doesn't matter how old you are.
[22:36.45]Stop judging people for playing video games the way that they like to.
[22:59.25]No audio?
[23:05.09]I'll turn it up.
[23:05.47]Is this me?
[23:16.00]Facecam, we've been good.
[23:17.06]No, not today.
[23:20.04]Not today.
[23:20.46]No facecam.
[23:22.16]We're in the chill zone right now.
[23:24.84]Alright, well, it actually is kind of loud.
[23:26.28]Still.
[23:26.96]Still.
[23:33.51]Can you do a nose cam?
[23:34.89]No.
[23:35.19]Did I just get shot in the head?
[23:45.30]That'd be so funny if it just started like that.
[23:49.64]Oh, the audio is fine.
[23:50.56]I can see it over here.
[23:56.68]Uh, this needs to be changed though.
[24:02.12]Is that 60% for everything?
[24:04.98]Yeah, this is fine.
[24:06.84]Maybe turn the effects down.
[24:08.38]Bring this up.
[24:09.56]Bring the master volume up.
[24:16.00]Great.
[24:17.92]Two cheats.
[24:19.06]I need to play the game first.
[24:25.19]Producer Andy.
[24:27.99]Uh, here we go.
[24:29.05]This needs to be much like six maybe.
[24:34.92]You still have a beard?
[24:35.64]No, it got way too hot.
[24:37.02]I had to shave it.
[24:37.54]Alright, here we go.
[24:41.61]Wait, the physics even work when you walk?
[24:49.57]What does it do?
[24:50.71]Can I pick that up?
[25:07.17]Have you seen the giant LED ball in Vegas?
[25:10.69]That thing is fucking crazy.
[25:13.65]You know what I'm looking forward to?
[25:14.61]I'm looking forward to when that becomes a giant snow globe in the winter.
[25:27.54]It can be anything.
[25:28.34]Is there a sprint?
[25:38.89]That has to change immediately.
[25:42.27]Input.
[25:44.01]That needs to be E is... Where is it?
[25:49.99]Cloak?
[25:50.36]Okay, we'll do cloak F. And then interact is E. There we go.
[26:02.73]Oh, there is no sprint.
[26:05.27]Oh my god, they were moving way faster.
[26:14.52]It's getting ready.
[26:15.14]It wants to do it.
[26:15.78]The dot appears in the center of the screen when you were in shadow.
[26:26.22]Oh, so the dot means that I can't be seen.
[26:27.77]Do they have audio devices?
[26:30.63]Do they have organic audio devices on the sides of their heads?
[26:43.68]Am I gonna get spotted?
[26:58.00]You can be seen in the darkness.
[27:02.12]If they let you rent the sphere, you should put an image of your face there.
[27:04.93]Yeah.
[27:12.62]Yep, this is your captain speaking.
[27:13.78]We're landing in nice, beautiful, sunny Las Vegas.
[27:17.48]If you look out your left window, you actually hear the strip is in view as we're landing here.
[27:22.45]If you take a look at the sphere today, it's the sus guy.
[27:25.69]I don't know if any of you know who that is.
[27:41.13]Well, your answer to the question is no, I don't have like an extra like six million dollars.
[27:45.01]So no, sorry.
[27:50.27]Health pack.
[27:53.25]Right.
[28:03.57]Why not?
[28:06.57]Is there a flashlight?
[28:09.40]There we go.
[28:25.52]Is it too loud?
[28:27.46]I have a feeling it's going to get very loud here in a second.
[28:29.32]I just looked at the... Are you tripping?
[28:40.11]Am I?
[28:40.87]I feel like it's going to get loud.
[28:41.63]Just be aware.
[28:42.05]It's probably going to get loud.
[28:45.11]Locked.
[28:51.52]He said rage mode has a warning if you click it Ooh
[29:13.69]Rage mode is insanely difficult.
[29:15.17]Basically, anything will kill you instantly.
[29:17.27]It is not recommended unless you have a minimum of 50 hours spent in the game.
[29:21.94]Our publisher even asked us to remove this mode.
[29:25.18]Are you absolutely sure you want to proceed?
[29:28.16]Oh my god.
[29:32.56]That's so funny.
[29:35.20]Alright, so I got a gun.
[29:37.12]Let's do a shoot test to see how loud this is.
[29:39.02]Mmm...
[29:43.58]That's... It's alright.
[29:44.34]I might need to drop the sensitivity a little bit more.
[29:57.03]Maybe it's 5?
[30:06.91]Alright, let's go.
[30:07.41]Oh my god.
[30:09.87]Okay, that's going to freak me out.
[30:11.47]I'm going to keep thinking someone's behind me.
[30:12.81]There's an auto-save.
[30:17.77]That's good.
[30:19.71]There's a jump.
[30:20.27]Cool.
[30:24.69]Jump in melee to do a powerful kick.
[30:27.43]Oh, that's right.
[30:28.09]There's a big jumping kick.
[30:33.66]What did I just hit?
[30:36.44]Guys broke my leg?
[30:40.00]Did you really just say there's a jump?
[30:41.92]Cool.
[30:45.98]Slide is alt.
[30:48.27]I think I want to change that.
[30:52.95]What does Q do?
[30:54.05]I think I want Q is slide.
[31:01.21]What is Q?
[31:01.49]Focus.
[31:01.81]Focus.
[31:10.66]Alt for me is weird because I have to take my hands off of my thumb is like in a weird spot.
[31:15.85]I'll try it.
[31:16.19]Middle mouse is not a bad one either, but I'll try it as it is.
[31:22.77]Because I'm going to hit the Windows key.
[31:24.21]Yeah, now I'm going to change it now.
[31:26.05]I always hit the Windows key if Alt needs to be pressed a lot.
[31:29.83]So let's change it.
[31:30.97]Let's make it something else.
[31:33.43]You press using your thumb?
[31:34.58]What do you mean?
[31:39.18]Would you use something else besides your thumb?
[31:43.52]I know what to do.
[31:45.82]Watch this.
[31:49.70]Mouse 4 for slide.
[31:51.02]Sounds pretty good.
[31:52.57]And then where's grenade?
[31:54.03]Grenade is going to be mouse... Mouse 5.
[31:59.77]Let's try that.
[32:03.95]Yeah, that's much better.
[32:04.69]That's great.
[32:08.10]Pick up Intel.
[32:09.96]Site 14 security message log.
[32:12.16]Read it.
[32:14.60]Cool.
[32:15.28]Actually, do I need to know this?
[32:29.53]Cool.
[32:30.23]Alright, let's go.
[32:30.73]Is this a stamina bar?
[32:38.78]This is locked.
[32:44.91]There is a flashlight.
[32:46.11]Oh, enemies can see the flashlight.
[32:48.17]This was the demo, wasn't it?
[32:49.65]I remember playing this in the demo.
[32:57.90]He's so high right now.
[33:00.84]I'm not.
[33:02.06]We're just enjoying video game.
[33:10.30]Is this game like fear?
[33:11.82]It has been compared to fear.
[33:13.60]Yes.
[33:29.08]Checking on the tunnel.
[33:42.10]Who is he shooting at?
[33:43.22]He just shoot at his friend.
[33:44.36]Do they know where I am?
[34:05.54]Got him.
[34:12.14]Slide.
[34:19.60]Wait, somebody, somebody over here.
[34:25.86]We're both stupid.
[34:26.70]We can't even hit each other.
[34:27.48]Oh yeah, that's right.
[34:34.76]I forgot.
[34:35.30]I forgot you could do this.
[34:36.74]Is he dead?
[34:48.27]Wait did I come this way?
[34:49.23]Wait did I come this way?
[34:50.39]I think I came this way.
[35:22.03]Okay.
[35:24.01]This is where I just bought everybody.
[35:25.80]Where's the goal?
[35:28.82]It's concrete.
[35:29.70]I don't know where I'm going.
[35:34.01]That's a rule on this channel.
[35:35.43]If the walls are all concrete, I don't know where I'm going.
[35:52.01]If the walls are gray, I'm not going to know where I'm going ever.
[36:00.86]If you're wondering why game companies made the for you to go like it hit the side of your head with your finger and a line goes on the ground, it's because of me.
[36:09.16]Blame me.
[36:10.72]It's all my fault.
[36:11.96]It's my fault.
[36:13.08]I'm the one that they do that for.
[36:22.79]Because I shot and fought people in here.
[36:24.61]Is there a map?
[36:26.57]Uh, I don't... Maybe not yet.
[36:29.37]Sorry, I'm reading chat too, so the walls are concrete.
[36:32.44]I'm looking over at chat every 10 seconds.
[36:36.04]Is this right?
[36:36.44]Go in the yellow doors?
[36:43.62]Dude, you're going backwards.
[36:47.54]Okay.
[36:47.66]Okay.
[36:59.79]Yellow door.
[37:01.25]And then up?
[37:02.40]Wasn't I just up here?
[37:08.80]Kick the red doors.
[37:22.76]Okay.
[37:23.54]I found it.
[37:35.15]That scared the shit out of me.
[37:36.61]Oh my god.
[37:48.84]Wait, that guy has a different gun.
[37:54.01]There's no aim down sights.
[37:59.11]There's the slowdown.
[38:11.70]Cool.
[38:12.50]I have full health.
[38:20.94]Put it on hard.
[38:21.54]I might, I might, I might.
[38:23.14]You don't have to be sprinting to the slide.
[38:29.52]That's cool.
[38:35.33]Shotgun.
[38:38.33]Yeah, I always pick the shotgun.
[38:44.49]Intel?
[38:44.87]Where are they?
[38:45.47]Oh my God.
[39:19.54]This is violent.
[39:20.39]This is a violent game by the way.
[39:22.21]Wow, that was loud.
[39:24.37]I can't see anything Alright, flashlight off What is all over my gun?
[39:48.00]Is that oil?
[39:48.50]Is this blood?
[39:49.60]It's blood.
[39:51.42]That looks like a CSGO skin.
[39:55.98]There's so much blood and guts all over it.
[39:59.42]That's like a factory new fucking blood-stained weapon.
[40:14.46]That guy exploded.
[40:24.77]Oh my god!
[40:25.87]What the?
[40:27.61]Is this guy live?
[40:31.28]What the fuck?
[40:34.16]That guy was climbing like Spider-Man on the wall.
[40:45.07]Okay, that was crazy.
[40:49.77]Anything else in here?
[41:01.21]I'm gonna have to get good pretty soon, though.
[41:02.57]There's a lot of things you can do with the, uh, the slide, it seems.
[41:07.58]Sprinting costs stamina.
[41:08.80]Killing enemies temporarily boosts stamina.
[41:10.62]Okay.
[41:13.60]You're playing on baby mode?
[41:17.68]Yeah.
[41:19.69]I might turn it up to hard.
[41:25.43]Baby mode would be easy, though, actually.
[41:28.85]You're laughing.
[41:29.39]People are exploding.
[41:32.69]I mean, it's kind of a wild thing going on in the screen that sometimes you don't know how to react to what's happening in front of you.
[41:38.80]Jeez.
[41:53.27]You know, there's a game mode you can turn on where it's confetti instead of blood.
[41:56.29]I almost want to turn it on for a little bit.
[41:58.61]Let's do, actually, let's do it.
[42:00.25]I'm curious.
[42:00.69]I want to see what it does.
[42:03.49]Confetti.
[42:26.40]Pyro mode.
[42:27.20]Pyrovision.
[42:27.88]Yeah.
[42:30.26]I still might need to turn the sensitivity down.
[42:47.81]Are we supposed to recognize this person?
[42:49.57]Ooh, a big token!
[42:59.94]Can you take the sword?
[43:00.56]I guess you can't take the sword.
[43:06.90]What the hell was that?
[43:24.19]They would definitely hear that.
[43:29.46]There's nobody back here don't mind that.
[43:38.00]What just happened to the wall?
[43:41.64]The wall just that was weird.
[43:53.83]Alright, I got all ammo.
[43:56.41]Let's go shotgun.
[44:01.16]What the?
[44:03.38]What just happened?
[44:04.02]I thought that guy was me for a second.
[44:12.52]Can I take a second just to understand?
[44:14.74]I thought I pulled out into third person mode somehow and that that was me in the room.
[44:27.47]The confetti is funny.
[44:32.48]I want to get one more person with the confetti and then we're good.
[44:41.32]Wait, secrets, no.
[44:45.25]Keep it on.
[44:48.15]Okay, I'm going to try to melee kill.
[45:12.13]Let's go.
[45:30.58]Turn up the FOV.
[45:31.18]I think it's at 90.
[45:35.14]Fast movement and nauseous.
[45:37.56]Is that 90?
[45:38.81]Should I go higher than 90?
[45:46.59]100?
[45:50.69]Go 110?
[45:50.91]Let's try 110.
[45:58.77]Oh, that is a little better.
[45:59.59]Okay.
[46:00.73]Also, I want to... Let's put this back on.
[46:06.57]Turn V-Sync off.
[46:07.50]Turn V-Sync off.
[46:08.32]Turn V-Sync off.
[46:09.16]Turn V-Sync off.
[46:10.88]What?
[46:13.78]Looks alright for me.
[46:24.35]Oh my God.
[46:25.11]That guy just tried to do a roundhouse kick to me.
[46:35.72]That guy just roundhouse kicked me in the head.
[46:37.46]We're going a little bit.
[46:49.85]We're going a little bit lower on the sensitivity.
[46:59.74]Let's go.
[47:00.02]I don't have any throwables, no grenades.
[47:08.88]Did that screen shake?
[47:09.78]I turned the screen shake off.
[47:19.71]I feel like I'm trying to score like a touchdown.
[47:22.07]Like, oh, he's got the ball.
[47:23.26]He's jumping over the offensive line.
[47:37.05]Oh my God.
[47:37.69]Turn the difficulty up.
[47:50.20]Let's try it.
[47:59.91]Must be dying one hit now.
[48:10.31]Ooh, what's that?
[48:13.01]I thought the chair was a person.
[48:19.01]Oh, I got grenades now.
[48:20.25]Grenades explode on impact?
[48:21.84]Alright, we're gonna have to make this work.
[48:26.20]Use silenced weapons to shoot out lights.
[48:28.50]Wait, where was there a silenced weapon?
[48:30.52]Ooh.
[48:32.48]Uh...
[48:43.97]Let's go in complete darkness.
[48:49.96]Get out of here!
[49:02.93]Oh my God!
[49:18.12]Who else?
[49:18.44]Who else?
[49:25.52]Jeez.
[49:41.19]That guy killed himself too.
[49:43.59]That guy killed himself.
[49:51.96]Uh, alright.
[49:52.56]This time, let me not do what I just did.
[49:54.70]Because I... I thought... Whatever.
[49:59.63]Alright.
[49:59.89]I got it.
[50:00.19]I got it.
[50:00.43]I got it.
[50:13.10]Any more lights?
[50:16.22]Forget about all the noise in the moving chair and desk over here.
[50:21.92]Did anyone see?
[50:25.43]What?
[50:37.98]Just staying down.
[50:55.69]Oh Alright, I got a cloak too I gotta use the cloak more often I am just breaking everything I touch Stop what the fuck?
[51:15.83]How do you miss when you're invisible
[51:42.78]Open the fucking door.
[51:44.46]Open this.
[51:46.40]Open the door.
[51:46.82]Give me a minute.
[51:59.45]What do you got?
[52:07.79]Alright.
[52:08.57]I got a good spot here.
[52:12.85]Uh, yeah, I'm taking this.
[52:14.62]Give me this thing.
[52:17.70]Weapon part acquired.
[52:18.80]Laser.
[52:21.42]Ooh.
[52:34.29]Customized weapon.
[52:38.11]Ah, um...
[52:50.29]Enemies can see the laser.
[52:51.47]I'm ready.
[53:14.60]Take the other part.
[53:15.42]There's another part.
[53:27.04]Okay.
[53:27.66]I missed a part.
[53:38.09]Where was this other weapon part?
[53:39.95]Oh, it's the briefcase.
[53:41.19]Okay.
[53:42.51]I thought it was ammo.
[53:46.03]Can I put two suppressors on this?
[53:47.67]So it's like a big long end of the barrel.
[54:00.52]Bolded stock.
[54:01.30]Higher recoil, but slightly faster reload times.
[54:03.70]I'll keep that.
[54:12.21]Can I put the suppressor on this shotgun?
[54:17.47]Why do people compare this to fear?
[54:18.79]I just got here.
[54:19.43]I don't notice it.
[54:21.14]I think it's mainly the slowdown mechanic.
[54:23.52]First person shooter slowdown mechanic.
[54:26.64]Lots of, you know, crazy physics shit happening.
[54:31.65]How would you even see me?
[54:42.76]Oh my god.
[54:43.52]I'm invisible.
[54:48.99]I'm invisible.
[54:49.45]I'm invisible.
[55:07.41]Got him.
[55:15.39]Oh, those aren't lasers aiming down the hallway.
[55:18.71]I thought those were laser sights.
[55:20.91]That's just my vision doing that.
[55:22.71]What?
[55:22.90]It is lasers.
[55:23.82]What the fuck?
[55:24.96]It is lasers.
[55:25.76]What?
[55:32.62]It is lasers.
[55:33.48]Okay.
[55:37.25]I promise I haven't taken any fucking edibles today.
[55:44.62]I thought it was just these doing that.
[55:46.56]Okay.
[55:47.54]Well.
[55:52.44]Can I get in here?
[56:06.99]I don't want him to see.
[56:16.86]The fuck is that?

[58:56.46]Why did the grenade take so long to go off?
[59:11.77]What?
[59:15.79]Is he still alive?
[59:19.29]Is he still alive?
[59:25.17]You've got to be fucking kidding me.

[64:24.82]Somebody said the assault rifle is terrible.
[64:28.11]This is a Guggity game.
[64:28.95]You shouldn't be standing still.
[64:31.57]Yeah, I know, but I don't have any charge.
[64:33.73]I'm going to turn the brightness up as well, too.
[64:37.91]Alright, hold on.

[67:43.05]OK, I'm good.
[67:47.11]What?
[67:49.38]What?
[67:51.54]Was he alive?
[67:52.34]I thought he blew up.
[68:02.39]Hold on.
[68:08.79]We gotta go up a little bit higher.
[69:09.84]DUDE I JUST MADE POPCORN I DIDN'T EVEN FUCKING HURT THE GUY WHAT THE F- OH MY- Okay, can I put it down to normal for a second?
[69:38.15]Holy shit, this is crazy.

[69:49.33]Alright, I got it.
[69:49.87]I got it.
[69:50.09]I got it.
[69:50.43]I'm just going to sit right here and I'm going to grab them when they get over here.
[70:40.87]Got it.
[70:51.29]Shit.
[70:53.11]Okay.
[71:24.75]Where'd he go?
[71:30.49]No, don't die!
[71:32.66]Oh my god!
[72:01.44]One left, one left, one left.
[72:02.28]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[72:10.80]Got him.
[72:12.58]Holy shit, that was fucking wild.
[72:17.20]Yeah.
[72:28.02]I remember this part.
[72:29.42]I remember.
[72:31.76]This is the demo.
[72:32.68]And then I thought these were enemies.
[72:34.14]I fucking shot this guy.
[72:39.67]Don't do that again.
[72:40.65]I killed this guy.
[72:41.85]I thought they were not... I mean, after that... Come on.
[72:48.27]Do it again.
[72:51.94]Sorry.
[72:52.60]I did a lot of screaming back there.
[72:55.62]I gotta pull it back.
[72:59.91]Don't do it.
[73:00.55]Don't do it.
[73:01.27]Don't.
[73:01.45]It's an achievement.
[73:03.21]There are consequences.
[73:16.58]No, I'm not doing it.
[73:22.84]There was at least four or five voice cracks during that as well.
[73:26.16]And I'm very embarrassed by it.
[73:43.60]It happens to everybody.
[73:44.44]Eh, it doesn't.
[73:57.55]Alright.
[74:04.23]I bet you couldn't even point out where Trapang is on a map.
[74:08.02]No, I couldn't.
[74:15.44]This is Raven.
[74:16.60]We're approaching the safe house.
[74:19.48]Roger that, ma'am.
[74:20.92]Patching you through to him now.
[74:23.78]It's a pleasure to finally meet you, 106.
[74:25.08]The Horizon Corporation had you locked away for a very long time.
[74:31.46]They must be frightened now that you are free.
[74:35.63]You want vengeance.
[74:37.57]So do we.
[74:40.49]Welcome to Task Force 27.
[74:46.91]So now that that's the kind of tutorial for a zone, that's the demo.
[74:52.83]What do you do from here?
[74:54.35]It's a very pretty game, I will say.
[75:00.28]And it runs really well.
[75:03.66]Something I think developers that make games like this, it runs very well.
[75:09.98]It's like, it's pretty smooth.
[75:24.18]You have a 3090?
[75:24.68]Yeah.
[75:28.18]Is it... How... Is 3090 still considered, like, good?
[75:32.40]How much more powerful is the 4090 compared to the 3090?
[75:35.21]Because I usually wait two or three generations.
[75:45.67]Should I wait till, like, the 5080?
[75:47.47]Or, like, the 6090?
[75:48.42]Okay.
[75:51.97]You don't stream in 1080p?
[75:53.64]Yeah, you know, that's gonna change.
[75:55.96]Pretty soon here.
[75:57.02]The one thing that sucks about having like a 1080p stream, the one thing I'm worried about is I just, turning, I would have to turn the bitrate up.
[76:09.04]Or I'd have to drop, maybe I'll just get like a streaming PC or something.
[76:20.90]Switch bitrate sucks anyways.
[76:25.04]Yeah.
[76:25.34]You have a 4090?
[76:26.04]No, I have a 3090.
[76:28.12]Do you play at 4K or 1080?
[76:29.44]If you're at 1080, you don't need more than a 3090.
[76:30.93]Yeah, I don't play in... Well, hold on a second here.
[76:36.73]I do play in... This is 4K, right?
[76:40.69]Technically?
[76:44.23]Isn't that 4K?
[76:48.06]No?
[76:48.52]Wait, what is it?
[76:49.38]2K?
[76:49.72]2K?
[76:52.42]That's not even 1440.
[76:53.20]That's not even 1440.
[76:57.16]That's not even 1080p.
[76:59.00]Dude, that's better than 1080p.
[77:02.65]That's better than 1080p.
[77:04.01]Wait.
[77:08.93]Oh, oops.
[77:15.31]Okay, now I'm playing in 1440p.
[77:19.54]Looks pretty good.
[77:20.74]Damn.
[77:21.74]Looks nice.
[77:28.93]that was a weird that's the kind of resolution that old old games I remember like warcraft 3 seeing some of those weird resolutions that they made for that game that you could have for like probably eight people that had that monitor alright so what do we do here cheats
[77:55.16]Complete mission on hard.
[77:56.82]Alright, so I have to beat all these missions on hard and I get the cheats.
[78:02.51]Customize appearance.
[78:04.35]Ooh, let's do that.
[78:12.76]Oh, hell yeah.
[78:13.38]Okay.
[78:13.58]I mean, I gotta go with the fucking red shoes.

[78:34.14]Whoa.
[78:35.90]Oh, these get kind of funky.
[78:37.00]Alright.

[79:37.43]Oh, I just scared myself.
[79:38.37]Alright.

[80:31.51]I'm my own worst enemy a lot of times, because even if sometimes if I'm fucking around, it still doesn't matter.
[80:45.76]Some of you will take away from this.
[80:48.04]Something's wrong with him.
[80:53.61]Can I take weapons or something?
[81:01.98]I like this weapon.
[81:35.71]Well, tried.
[81:50.07]Tried what?
[81:51.15]Testing the game.
[81:52.21]Alright.
[82:09.81]Do I have a better gun?
[82:10.43]I have a better gun to shoot that with?
[82:17.98]Dude, come on.
[82:18.64]I don't want to wait like another two minutes before I can spawn again.
[82:24.22]What just... Alright, I got to disable that.
[82:41.37]Oh no, look out!
[82:42.03]It's the guy with the clown shoes!
[82:49.04]Grab him!
[82:50.10]Grab him!
[82:54.32]That guy's head was made out of glass!
[83:04.37]We shouldn't even be fighting.
[83:11.48]You now!
[83:22.96]Go.
[83:34.75]Did he say hurry the fuck up?
[83:45.11]Alright, where are they coming from?
[83:55.68]Oh, there he is.
[83:56.30]Okay.
[84:12.78]Shotgun.
[84:25.29]Oh shit.
[84:26.79]Oh shit.
[84:40.45]Got it.
[85:01.75]Got him.
[85:02.49]Where'd he go?
[85:08.19]Keep your eyes down, Grenade Out!
[85:23.38]Grenade out!
[85:23.70]Grenade out!
[85:51.14]High value target, Jackal.
[85:57.63]I almost shot the helicopter.
[86:04.37]What's in here?
[86:04.83]Ooh, breach charges.
[86:11.94]Now, do I blow this door?
[86:21.12]Ooh, I like this song.
[86:58.51]It's dead?
[87:05.27]Oh, look out, shoot out!
[87:06.96]Oh, in the room with the bottles!
[87:41.88]Oh, I'm in trouble here.
[87:43.06]Why did he get pulled so fast?
[87:55.71]What sucked him down?
[87:57.56]He was magnetized.
[87:58.82]Holy shit.
[88:12.52]Who else?
[88:12.76]I think we're clear.
[88:21.68]Am I going here?
[88:31.92]Where do I go from here?
[88:37.40]I came through here.
[88:58.69]The guy you threw.
[88:59.77]What do you mean?
[89:10.62]Earlier.
[89:11.08]I've thrown a lot of people so far.
[89:19.54]Dude, I don't know where I threw that person.
[89:23.60]Did I throw it in the pool?
[89:30.84]What about him?
[89:33.96]The glass roof.
[89:35.80]Oh, okay.
[89:36.40]That was this way.
[89:43.62]Can I not go?
[89:47.05]How do I get out here?
[90:04.04]I don't think you do.
[90:05.44]Wait, did I actually throw the guy?
[90:07.38]Did I need a key or something from the guy I threw over there?
[90:12.37]That you mean over there?
[90:13.41]No?
[90:17.41]No, I don't think so.
[90:21.65]I think I just got in the wrong way.
[90:24.85]Wait, really?
[90:27.15]Shoot all the glass?
[90:36.49]I don't think so.
[90:37.15]There's a breach charge.
[90:40.83]Hold on.
[90:45.29]Keep going up this event.
[90:58.88]Can I just... Can't.
[90:59.56]Underground.
[91:04.74]Underground.
[91:09.52]Oh, wait a minute.
[91:21.21]The walls aren't concrete.
[91:22.21]You don't have an excuse this time.
[91:24.91]Yep, I may have thrown the guy that had the item I needed across the wall that I can't... Is it over there?
[91:30.57]That's a breach charge right there, isn't it?
[91:33.36]Right there.
[91:35.52]That's a charge.
[91:37.10]Okay, well, I'll just reload.
[91:47.54]Okay, we're good.
[91:53.66]Remember your sacrifice.
[91:54.72]Everybody fall back down!
[92:01.40]Did you hear that?
[92:05.32]Watch your back!
[92:05.83]I'm alright!
[92:07.85]I'm alright!
[92:12.33]I'm alright!
[92:13.49]Over here!
[92:14.29]I'm going to fuck you up!
[92:22.79]I'm gonna fuck you up.
[92:41.18]Alright, where's the item?
[92:59.32]Let me in that room too!
[93:20.67]Let me in that room!
[93:27.09]Oh, those are my friends.
[93:28.31]Oh, shit.
[93:34.86]I'm sorry.
[93:39.36]Well, the grenade bounced off the back of his head, so he'll have a welt.
[93:43.28]He'll be okay.
[93:59.32]I'll go with that.
[94:02.22]Any customization options for the other stuff?
[94:11.46]Fold it up.
[94:11.88]Let's go.
[94:21.69]I need more gun parts.
[94:37.72]Oh, dude.
[94:38.36]Whoa, hold on.
[94:51.34]Nice.
[95:00.87]Oh, what is that?
[95:04.11]That's a sniper rifle.
[95:19.33]You were the only person left, man.
[95:20.67]I'm going in!
[95:26.13]Cover me!
[95:31.08]I gotta get a no-scope headshot.
[95:33.22]That's the only way I'll be happy.
[96:12.97]Look at the DPS meters.
[96:14.25]He ain't doing shit.
[96:22.25]You alright?
[96:22.69]Alright, we gotta go in together.
[96:28.75]With me and on me.
[96:29.89]One, two, three, go!
[96:30.47]I'm gonna check him out!
[96:35.81]Cover me!
[96:46.54]What was that?
[96:47.24]What?
[96:54.43]Who's saying that?
[96:55.61]Oh, it's the radio.
[96:56.75]I thought it was one of these guys.
[97:00.41]How's everybody doing tonight?
[97:01.39]We having fun or what?
[97:15.82]You play video games like my dad.
[97:19.14]Bro, I'm almost 40, alright?
[97:21.34]This is just the way it is.
[97:22.40]This is how it's going to be going forward.
[97:24.80]And... I'm sorry.
[97:26.88]This is the way it is.
[97:28.34]Dr. Emerson is in that tower.
[97:30.50]We need to find a way inside.
[97:31.60]You're not getting through here, you son of a bitch.
[97:38.06]Callie, this is Oregon.
[97:39.46]He's trapped.
[97:43.74]What?
[97:44.32]No, I was gonna stealth.
[97:45.40]Oh shit, they're far ahead!
[97:53.06]We need people!
[97:53.40]We've got to get back down soon!
[97:54.32]Yeah, I think we got a man down!
[97:58.26]We're on again!
[97:58.76]I got a clear shot!
[98:25.74]There's one more person in here.
[98:30.07]Nah, whatever.
[98:34.73]Wait, this is... This is a... Somebody said this is a Kickstarter?
[98:40.67]Wait, what do you mean Kickstarter?
[98:52.44]Was this game a Kickstarter?
[98:59.64]You'll never beat me!
[99:13.16]He just punched me.
[99:13.72]That guy was jabbing me in the chin.
[99:15.22]Ooh, weapon parts.
[99:21.91]Suppressor.
[99:22.47]Hmm.
[99:26.71]What about the sniper rifle?
[99:32.47]Somebody's still here.
[99:34.79]Is it you?
[99:35.53]It's not you, is it, man?
[99:37.65]No way.
[99:51.69]Shotgun suppressor.
[99:52.83]I feel like that's the most counterintuitive, counterproductive thing to put on a shotgun.
[100:05.35]Does that actually work?
[100:08.73]I feel like you can't suppress the sound of a shotgun.
[100:13.47]It makes it sound cool.
[100:20.31]This person's been looking for me this whole time.
[100:23.06]Communicating on the radio.
[100:27.12]Okay, let's... We have to examine this guy for a little while.
[100:37.42]I wish there was a cough button.
[100:50.25]Is he in there?
[100:50.77]Is he in the... What?
[100:53.42]No, grab him.
[100:55.62]Is he in there?
[100:57.52]What do you mean mouse five grenade?
[101:16.07]Alright, be careful here.
[101:20.71]That doesn't consume your grenades.
[101:21.97]By the way, that's actually kind of crazy.
[101:28.05]Anymore ammo.
[101:31.77]I'm for the boss fight.
[101:33.01]I'm going to use the sniper rifle only.
[101:36.25]That's the boss killer weapon for sure. 100%.
[101:55.59]Woo!
[101:57.57]I got one of those too.
[102:07.33]See ya.
[102:14.60]Oh, that doesn't hurt you.
[102:39.71]It's just you two assholes left.
[102:48.77]God damn it.
[102:49.31]How do I get rid of these guys?
[102:54.31]Ow.
[103:06.97]These guys have concrete bodies.
[103:24.91]He didn't hear anything.
[103:27.29]Only they had a weak spot.
[103:28.23]Yeah, I shot the fire extinguishers off their backs and they didn't die.
[103:38.87]I'm gonna do this slow.
[104:08.12]Why is he laughing at me?
[104:09.08]Oh my God.
[104:26.43]Blow up, blow up, please.
[104:36.97]Blow up, please.
[104:39.57]Oh.
[104:40.83]This guy.
[104:41.99]Seriously, dude.
[104:42.67]The guy's got a jetpack on now.
[104:47.41]Hold on, I gotta take a sip of this.
[104:54.49]Okay.
[104:57.91]Can you tackle them?
[104:59.03]I don't think those guys fall down if you tackle them.
[105:00.94]They're too heavy.
[105:01.74]Alright, I'm just going in.
[105:03.68]Fuck it.
[105:08.67]Everybody in this room Watch out
[105:39.41]I'm going to hide in here for a sec.
[105:42.09]Oh my God, they're going to get hit by those.
[105:43.51]They're going to be stupid and they're going to walk into that.
[105:46.75]Watch this.
[105:57.42]What am I hitting in the way?
[106:00.04]There ain't nothing in the way.
[106:01.35]What?
[106:04.44]You just aggroed more enemies?
[106:06.00]Alright.
[106:13.60]These guys are really hard.
[106:14.63]I got to kill those guys first.
[106:19.39]I thought he was going to walk in and walk backwards and blow up.
[106:36.68]Okay, this one.
[106:37.22]I took that guy's helmet off too.
[106:58.41]Alright, we're good.
[106:59.57]Better.
[107:07.92]Oh my God.
[107:08.84]There we go.
[107:21.55]That's better.
[107:49.16]Show yourself.
[107:59.74]That guy was just talking.
[108:01.04]Okay, he's dead.
[108:12.85]I need this health on him.
[108:13.61]No, I got a full recharge.
[108:14.61]I'm good.
[108:20.25]Is there any other ammo I can grab here, though?
[108:21.71]I feel like I need it bad.
[108:22.83]Hmm.
[108:32.96]I guess I can just take this and run around.
[108:34.52]Does this help me?
[108:40.48]Pistol's really good.
[108:41.16]The pistol does seem really good, doesn't it?
[108:42.83]Alright, I got enough.
[108:57.19]Okay, now don't die in here.
[109:12.26]Where's this guy?
[109:36.21]Okay, don't run around like that here, no way.
[109:47.74]Nice.
[110:04.57]I can't grab him.
[110:05.13]I was trying to grab him.
[110:07.85]Oh no, Charles.
[110:09.09]Oh no.
[110:18.34]What the hell was that?
[110:19.48]Did somebody walk across the tripwire?
[110:23.02]I don't know.
[110:37.84]Alright, this is gonna be hard now.
[110:42.38]Who's here?
[110:47.25]Oh, fuck!
[110:51.33]I don't... I think I made out better than they did.
[111:08.45]He's still alive.
[111:09.11]Oh my God.
[111:19.36]Get out of here.
[111:21.34]I thought that was the doorway.
[111:22.68]I thought that was the doorway.
[111:30.99]I thought this was a hallway.
[111:32.69]I thought that was the ground and this was the wall.
[111:45.83]Wile E. Coyote bit.
[111:46.95]Yeah, seriously.
[111:47.67]Wait, there's still people here.
[111:53.47]Uh oh, that's the Jackal.
[111:56.54]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[111:57.28]Oh shit, they're gonna throw grenades in here.
[112:05.70]I'm in so much trouble.
[112:08.01]Oh god.
[112:13.81]What the hell does he have for a weapon?
[112:32.64]Oh, I'm still sliding.
[112:38.64]It's not gonna hurt me, right?
[113:07.87]Alright.
[113:08.41]I had it last time.
[113:09.19]I'm good.
[113:10.45]I know what I'm doing.
[113:10.95]I know what I'm doing.
[113:11.49]I know what I'm doing.
[113:12.00]You're going to think I'm stupid for this, but it's not stupid.
[113:14.20]Trust me.
[113:52.26]Oh, this is hard.
[114:03.40]Get me in the room at least.
[114:13.19]Oh Lord.
[114:24.79]I got nothing to do I. Holy shit.
[114:48.46]OK, here we go.
[114:49.90]I gotta go invisible and I'm gonna run behind everybody.
[114:51.66]I wish I didn't throw all three of my grenades.
[114:55.94]Like a dummy.
[115:05.94]There he is.
[115:06.66]He's dead.
[115:07.00]Oh, that's so many people.
[115:16.69]Stop, please, please, please, please, please.
[115:36.95]I'm alright for now.
[115:46.28]Where are they?
[115:46.64]Are they in the room?
[115:47.26]I think they're in the far room.
[115:51.84]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[116:10.92]I think I killed one.
[116:26.48]Whoa.
[116:26.78]Whoa.
[116:34.99]Guy was just whispering to himself.
[116:37.19]I got it.
[116:37.67]There we are.
[116:41.84]These big rooms with all the... all the uh... Those are fun.
[116:55.03]Sliding under the flare was dope.
[116:56.91]Yeah, it's fun.
[116:58.53]I didn't even pick this up.
[117:23.08]Hey, do that bit again where you get really mad and have a death counter that's really high.
[117:26.74]Nah, you can only do that so many times.
[117:28.58]What's going on in here?
[117:35.45]All it costs is a bit of your kindness.
[117:36.51]The Pandora Institute.
[118:04.89]I value... Oh wait, we're not done.
[118:06.95]We're not done.
[118:14.82]Hey.
[118:16.14]I'm in here.
[118:16.60]You gonna walk over here?
[118:41.44]What the hell?
[118:42.32]What the fuck was that guy in scuba gear?
[118:44.50]That guy was in a full scuba outfit.
[118:46.50]What the hell happened?
[118:55.42]That reminded me of... I feel like I queued up a bunch of actions.
[118:59.45]We all queued up actions at the same time, and we all did them at the same time.
[119:02.67]That was like a strategy game.
[119:04.35]I feel like I was playing XCOM for a second.
[119:06.57]Everyone just does all their moves at the same time.
[119:08.05]Is that how XCOM works?
[119:10.86]Put your feet in the horizon.
[119:38.16]I'm gonna let you kill me, no way.
[119:44.28]Stop throwing grenades.
[119:47.50]How many grenades do you guys have?
[119:51.44]Cease fire, that's right.
[119:53.28]Let's talk about it.
[120:03.53]Whoa!
[120:12.35]I snapped his neck.
[120:19.04]Are we all done here?
[120:20.06]Is that it now?
[120:20.88]Can I keep going?
[120:23.00]Holy shit.
[120:28.62]Take this.
[120:32.42]He should have just shot me in the head.
[120:36.30]At some point, you don't scream before you're about to do something.
[120:41.52]Take this is probably what you shouldn't be yelling.
[120:45.85]Take this.
[120:47.39]And then he goes for a kick.
[120:51.87]This is kind of fucked up.
[120:52.87]What happened here?
[121:05.31]OK.
[121:13.91]One of those times I'm going to get roundhouse kicked in the head and it's going to kill me and I'm going to scream.
[121:22.02]I just picked up Doctor Emerson signal.
[121:24.88]It's coming from the basement.
[121:26.80]You need to find an elevator and take it down OK.
[121:30.54]Boom.
[121:33.74]Whoa.
[121:35.82]What's going on here?
[121:49.83]Okay.
[121:55.07]The music's getting kind of strange.
[122:02.19]School.
[122:07.54]That was a scoring moment, it really was.
[122:09.12]You guys are right.
[122:10.85]Instead of jumping off a cliff, you can jump into someone's arms.
[122:20.07]What?
[122:20.29]Oh dear.
[122:41.17]106, man of the hour.
[122:43.73]Oh, hello.
[122:44.17]I'll get that elevator unlocked for you.
[122:48.27]Are you going to die right when this opens?
[122:49.95]Yeah, I got it.
[122:53.73]According to the schematics, this elevator is going to take you straight to the basement.
[122:57.96]It's probably flooded with grunts right now, but that shouldn't be a problem for a super soldier.
[123:04.46]I got to get back to my team.
[123:06.38]Good luck.
[123:07.51]Alright, well, good luck.
[123:09.37]Thanks for the help.
[123:19.56]Not dead, yeah.
[123:20.50]Still alive.
[123:21.70]Still going.
[123:29.70]I'm just waiting.
[123:31.16]Something's gonna... Yeah, come on.
[123:33.30]It's an elevator in one of these kinds of games.
[123:35.00]Of course something bad's gonna happen.
[123:44.49]What the hell was that?
[123:45.67]Do not use elevators.
[123:53.76]Well, I just used one.
[124:14.43]That's a lot of blood.
[124:16.77]Don't use elevators.
[124:17.79]Don't use the elevators.
[124:18.65]Do not use the elevators.
[124:19.63]Do not use... Take only one.
[124:21.31]Don't be selfish.
[124:22.93]What are these?
[124:23.47]Water?
[124:23.75]$5.50 for a water.
[124:29.16]What the hell is going on here?
[124:34.56]Yeah, amusement park prices.
[124:48.80]We're going to disable this door.
[124:54.26]OK.
[124:57.70]I grab that.
[124:59.30]Oh.
[125:16.39]Take the health.
[125:16.95]Can I get through here?
[125:23.19]Oh well.
[125:30.66]Dr Hall, you have exceeded maximum overtime hours.
[125:34.58]Maximum overtime.
[125:35.78]OK.
[125:36.66]Wait.
[125:36.88]Intel.
[125:37.02]Patient exposure.
[125:37.98]Wait, hold on.
[125:54.01]The effects on a human subject were catastrophic.
[125:57.39]Upon exposure, the subject's DNA was rapidly rewritten, causing grotesque mutations and physical deformations.
[126:05.23]The subject was immediately transformed.
[126:06.95]Its skin took on a sickly green hue, becoming blistered and swollen, oozing a thick green liquid.
[126:16.96]Holy shit.
[126:17.74]Okay.
[126:21.45]Well, I think... Okay.
[126:31.79]Can I open this door?
[126:33.48]No.
[126:41.90]Abandoned move to Maxwell.
[126:43.82]Speed Darwin.
[126:50.15]Okay.
[126:50.33]Okay.
[126:53.50]Oh, I got a lot.
[127:10.53]That was so funny.
[127:13.01]Thanks.
[127:14.67]I really was hoping it was good.
[127:20.18]Am I the visitor?
[127:31.05]You know what?
[127:32.55]I actually do prefer the pistol.
[127:34.05]Somebody said it.
[127:34.55]I actually do want it instead.
[127:38.22]To Dr. Clark, keep this off radio.
[127:43.84]It's impossible.
[127:44.86]Sterilization impossible.
[127:45.98]Extraction impossible.
[127:47.40]We're already compromised.
[127:49.08]Relay orders to men.
[127:50.12]Enable lockdown.
[127:50.94]Procedure disabled.
[128:02.90]Are we going to get like a Satan face here?
[128:04.48]I would imagine a Satan face is going to show up in a second.
[128:18.86]Turn it off.
[128:21.82]Lockdown sequence aborted.
[128:24.21]Reinitializing facility.
[128:32.86]You got one guy here.
[128:39.92]The one guy that had to come in here.
[128:49.11]What is that is a giant bat?
[128:52.43]Okay.
[128:53.21]This just turned into a different game.
[128:58.32]Although he's perfectly framed right here, too.
[129:00.38]He runs right in.
[129:02.48]Right center frame.
[129:04.42]Points at us.
[129:05.44]I see him!
[129:06.39]That guy's guaranteed to die.
[129:08.37]Guaranteed.
[129:13.59]Oh, goddammit.
[129:14.51]Alright, this just became a scary game.
[129:23.91]Conflicted scientist email.
[129:28.40]Morality of our research.
[129:29.50]Push the boundaries of medicine and science.
[129:33.60]It is essential that we do not let personal things get in the way.
[129:36.37]Our goal is to save lives.
[129:37.55]Okay.
[129:42.21]Maybe I shouldn't have taken the pistol.
[129:48.11]I want to go see the thing.
[129:48.83]I want to slow-mo that thing.
[129:51.74]Keep out.
[129:58.23]Shit.
[130:06.81]Is the game a photo mode?
[130:08.31]I don't think it does.
[130:10.80]I don't think so.
[130:12.30]Did he just get me?
[130:36.05]A new special infected or something?
[130:49.46]Okay.
[130:55.72]I was not going to stand close to that.
[130:57.98]No fucking chance.
[131:01.62]It looked like it was coming through the wall at me already.
[131:05.87]Mountain Dew Overdose.
[131:11.75]Stop doing that.
[131:12.91]It's scary.
[131:13.47]Hmm.
[131:40.88]Are we screaming?
[131:46.70]Sometimes, Jerma, you sound like Spongebob.
[131:49.73]That's alright.
[131:56.37]Oh, God.
[131:56.99]Alright, this is now infected.
[131:59.45]Got a mutated alien world or something.
[132:10.69]Oh my God!
[132:11.57]Okay, this is... I love how they bumped into each other though.
[132:22.62]That was fun.
[132:35.54]Get out of here!
[132:42.23]Wait, can I grab the enemy?
[132:43.63]Oh my god.
[132:58.20]Woo!
[133:04.33]Am I not killing them?
[133:17.46]Am I not killing them?
[133:18.18]I don't think they're dying.
[133:24.06]Way to go.
[133:24.48]I'm playing Cod Zombies now.
[133:32.57]It's alright.
[133:35.89]I play it like Cod Zombies.
[133:46.87]Fuck you, idiot.
[133:47.99]Why are you doing that?
[133:49.23]Stop.
[133:49.83]They can't be right next to you.
[133:55.24]God damn it.
[134:02.76]Alright.
[134:03.68]Get it together.
[134:15.43]And...
[134:18.05]That works.
[134:18.51]I got an idea.
[134:19.83]Ready?
[134:20.03]That kind of worked.
[134:33.24]Don't do it again.
[134:34.22]I can't be trusted.
[134:51.72]Okay, I'm good.
[134:53.70]My accolades!
[134:54.16]Alright, I think there's only... They just keep spawning, so... Good throw, actually, that time.
[135:42.02]I didn't even know I threw it.
[135:46.42]I didn't even know I threw that.
[135:55.98]There's a lot of enemies.
[135:56.97]I don't even have enough bullets to kill all these things.
[135:58.97]Alright.
[135:59.39]Alright.
[135:59.67]Alright.
[135:59.93]Alright.
[136:00.19]Alright.
[136:01.25]Okay.
[136:02.83]Everybody relax.
[136:03.47]I'm going to take a sip of my tea.
[136:08.10]I'm not going to sound like letting the air out of a balloon really slowly.
[136:13.20]I'm going to just do it.
[136:16.53]I'm going to get focused and I'm going to do it.
[136:59.61]Oh, my God, I missed.
[137:24.54]Oh.
[137:57.36]Somebody said, are those trip hangs?
[138:00.10]Why is this guy just sitting here?
[138:01.86]What the fuck was that guy doing?
[138:24.02]I got it.
[138:24.32]Hooray.
[138:33.48]What was that?
[138:35.34]You gotta be shitting me, really.
[138:36.70]Let me collect.
[138:46.97]I feel like there's a lot of stuff I can get now.
[138:55.43]Can I do more damage on the handgun?
[138:59.03]I think those, yeah, I think those were trip hang twos.
[139:05.88]Those trepangs.
[139:09.24]I thought that was a giant laptop.
[139:15.39]It's you, dude.
[139:16.17]You're the trepang.
[139:22.71]Okay.
[139:25.87]I think I... Wait.
[139:32.52]No, I like the shotgun.
[139:33.66]Hmm.
[139:43.65]Uh oh.
[139:48.51]Somebody was here.
[140:06.76]Go to the door with blood or no blood?
[140:13.83]I hear it.
[140:19.42]This is going to be another huge wave and I have no ammo.
[140:33.89]Thank God.
[140:48.68]Oh, it's a... It's a shotgun.
[140:57.53]Is it better to take the regular shotgun or this one?
[141:08.58]Take the suppressor off.
[141:15.64]Fuck the suppressor.
[141:16.34]Yeah, suppressor lowers damage.
[141:18.85]I don't want to be damaged.
[141:22.37]It's just the same gun.
[141:23.05]Yeah, I'll take it.
[141:23.75]My mom wants to know if there's swearing in this game.
[141:35.04]I'm not allowed to watch if there's swearing.
[141:39.07]I think there's a swearing in the game, but I think more importantly people's heads are exploding so I think I think that's also something to keep in mind Jesus it is a bat
[142:07.26]We're just... It's scary!
[142:15.80]What?
[142:24.97]Is it behind me?
[142:25.65]Is it right behind me?
[142:26.47]There's no way anybody can do that.
[142:35.29]Oh!
[142:39.72]Where do I go?
[142:40.40]How do I get out of here?
[142:57.33]I'm gonna keep running.
[142:57.87]I'm not gonna stop.
[143:02.60]He's dead.
[143:03.08]There's nothing we can do for him.
[143:06.00]Pick up his flash drive.
[143:11.23]Still alive?
[143:16.74]Ooh, he has another gigantic coin.
[143:21.86]Your next objective is to destroy the subject.
[143:24.87]We've gone too far.
[143:26.29]We can't let this thing escape.
[143:28.11]That's not what she meant.
[143:28.99]Okay.
[143:29.67]I thought... Arm up.
[143:31.87]You'll be going down to the reactors next.
[143:37.67]She said, destroy the subject.
[143:39.73]I'm like, okay.
[143:40.45]I guess, does that mean... Alright, where are we gonna go?
[143:50.04]Dude, you know what I'm just noticing right now?
[143:53.94]My mouse is like... Look at my mouse.
[144:00.63]That's strange, isn't it?
[144:06.92]I didn't even notice that till right now.
[144:11.20]Can you guys see my mouse on the top and left of the screen right now?
[144:18.45]Or is that only coming up for me?
[144:23.73]Jesus, I'm sorry.
[144:24.37]I probably scared you, but I scared myself.
[144:26.61]It is there.
[144:27.35]Hold on.
[144:28.33]Maybe I should put it like exclusive full screen.
[144:49.70]It's not doing it anymore.
[144:50.76]But why did it zoomed in over here?
[144:51.81]Hold on.
[144:56.07]Huh.
[144:59.35]Wow.
[144:59.85]Is it doing it still?
[145:00.67]No.
[145:02.43]Huh.
[145:03.63]That was really strange.
[145:05.57]Has it been happening the whole time?
[145:09.43]I think it has been.
[145:14.18]Not really.
[145:14.80]I didn't notice.
[145:15.36]No.
[145:16.60]It might have been.
[145:19.87]Okay, well.
[145:21.61]If you have a mouse show up on your screen, then just go exclusive full screen.
[145:24.24]It'll fix it.
[145:32.12]Alright, now I have to destroy this subject.
[145:34.88]Anything else in here?
[145:37.49]No.
[145:37.91]Wow, that's a lot of stuff.
[145:42.57]They are preparing me for a gigantic boss fight.
[145:45.77]So, let's go ahead and take... I want sniper rifle.
[145:50.00]Sniper rifle, shotgun.
[145:51.00]This reminds me of that VR game that Ster and I played.
[146:01.59]Where our arms were wicked long and... We were able to put our arms behind our backs and shoot ourselves in the back.
[146:13.53]We were aiming the guns behind ourselves.
[146:21.98]Oh, that was so fun.
[146:27.04]That game was so fun.
[146:28.36]That is so funny.
[146:30.42]Okay, um... I can hear the thing screaming in the other room.
[146:39.97]What about the sniper?
[146:43.41]No.
[146:46.31]Why'd you pick a horror game for a chill stream?
[146:49.59]Well, chill stream in the sense that I'm kind of just playing.
[146:53.93]Just hanging out.
[146:59.77]Alright, I'm ready to go.
[147:04.83]Can you do, can you akimbo shotguns?
[147:07.35]I, can you, can you do well?
[147:10.73]I don't think you can.
[147:11.51]Maybe not yet.
[147:17.68]You can?
[147:19.04]Not yet.
[147:19.46]Okay.
[147:21.04]Alright.
[147:22.46]I think that does it.
[147:23.18]Maybe... Is there any more grenades I can grab or no?
[147:26.70]He's... He's waiting for me to come in the room.
[147:29.08]Okay.
[147:33.86]Boss area.
[147:34.62]These shoes.
[147:35.28]God.
[147:53.82]I think I can hear his wings flapping.
[147:55.24]Running around up here.
[148:00.42]Shit.
[148:32.85]Anything?
[148:33.15]No.
[148:34.13]Somebody's brain?
[148:35.93]Dude, that's their full brain.
[148:38.76]Their whole ass brain is out of their head.
[148:41.82]Not even in any more than one piece.
[148:43.66]Their whole brain?
[148:45.16]The entire brain.
[148:48.00]That was surgically removed.
[148:49.20]That was not exploded or anything.
[148:50.98]Okay, let's do it.
[149:12.71]Alright, cue the music.
[149:15.93]Secure it.
[149:16.25]You want to read it?
[149:16.67]Get those laser gates turned on as soon as possible.
[149:20.21]Just heard from the eggheads.
[149:22.45]Just one of those things.
[149:23.55]Get inside a reactor.
[149:24.53]This whole place is going up in flames.
[149:26.19]Okay, well, let's do it.
[149:35.09]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[149:36.35]Here it comes.
[149:58.24]Maybe not yet.
[149:59.92]Maybe.
[150:10.55]Looks like they're highly unstable.
[150:13.20]I've got an idea.
[150:14.76]It's a bit unusual, but it just might work.
[150:46.34]Is that a rocket launcher or something?
[150:47.50]No.
[150:48.56]Is it?
[150:49.26]No.
[150:56.01]Okay.
[150:57.15]Let's do it.
[151:21.33]Alright, got one.
[151:21.82]Okay.
[151:34.19]Wait, there's health over here.
[151:37.53]Just throw him out the window.
[151:39.51]Did I?
[151:42.37]Damn it.
[151:43.92]I think I walked over it accidentally.
[151:46.04]No, it's better.
[152:05.18]Okay, there's like three or four more of these.
[152:22.36]Another one in there?
[152:23.04]Oh my goodness.
[152:35.46]Oh, there's one up here.
[152:46.63]Alright, get out.
[152:54.73]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[152:56.01]Uh oh.
[153:02.54]Oh shit, I have to run.
[153:17.95]Alright, I just had to see.
[153:20.13]It's going to be a checkpoint right there.
[153:21.45]It doesn't.
[153:22.09]Oh no, it's not.
[153:23.17]Don't do that again.
[153:26.41]Don't do that again.
[153:34.41]That's me shooting the gun.
[153:46.72]Shut up!
[153:48.24]Shut up!
[153:56.79]I didn't throw that guy.
[153:58.39]That guy jumped in on his own.
[153:59.87]I didn't throw that guy.
[154:13.25]That guy!
[154:14.67]Jesus!
[154:20.16]Get over!
[154:20.76]Somebody just... Okay, go.
[154:24.72]I won't be an idiot this time.
[154:25.94]I promise.
[154:36.45]Alright, I'm out.
[154:44.31]Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
[154:56.74]Slide! Slide! Slide! Slide! Slide!
[154:57.86]You fucking McDonalds shoe motherfucker let's go!
[155:03.04]Whoa! It's right behind me. That was actually terrifying.
[155:06.00]Where do I go? Where do I go?
[155:08.12]We're fine! WHOA!
[155:18.42]Chill stream.
[155:22.30]Hurry!
[155:23.06]Get it!
[155:32.23]Fuck you!
[155:32.63]Ah!
[156:00.65]Open, open, open!
[156:07.01]Where even is it?
[156:07.75]I made it.
[156:27.17]That was crazy.
[156:29.63]Jeez.
[156:37.82]Am I good?
[156:38.24]Did I make it?
[156:42.51]What's the name of the game?
[156:44.95]Trey Pang 2.
[157:09.09]I'm picking up a signal from 106.
[157:17.09]I'm alive.
[157:20.81]You're still with us.
[157:22.37]We're almost done just getting everyone ready to extract.
[157:31.84]I have a feeling that thing is not dead.
[157:35.30]Mighty fine work you did down there.
[157:38.50]Raven's on his way now to pick you up first.
[157:41.20]He'll see you at the helipad.
[157:44.42]Oh, thanks guys.
[157:57.23]Okay, let's get it.
[158:01.09]Don't walk right into it, dude.
[158:03.21]What are you guys doing?
[158:05.31]What?
[158:18.42]Where to go?
[158:19.01]Where to go?
[158:19.73]Where to go?
[158:35.68]Goodbye.
[158:50.08]Where is it going?
[158:51.65]Jesus!
[159:30.45]Just staring at me.
[159:36.42]There you are, there you are, there you are.
[159:39.22]Alright, now I'm going to run this way.
[159:43.31]And here we go.
[159:44.09]I want to get close as hell.
[160:02.83]I have... Oh my god, I don't have anyone slow down.
[160:04.81]Got him.
[160:04.99]That's when Horizon's hiding behind closed doors.
[160:32.59]Chill stream chill stream vibes.
[160:34.54]That's right.
[160:38.26]They try to justify it all.
[160:40.58]Saying their research will change the world.
[160:44.96]That's why we're here to correct their mistakes.
[160:48.06]One black side at a time.
[160:50.36]What difficulty this on hard?
[160:52.99]This is Raven.
[160:54.45]We're out of here.
[160:57.79]Sorry.
[161:02.30]It was a good shot though.
[161:12.36]I have to pee.
[161:21.16]I'll be right back.
[161:23.96]And we'll keep going.
[161:26.16]I did unlock infinite stamina as a cheat.
[161:36.88]All progression will be saved on easy difficulty, regardless of your current difficulty.
[161:40.99]Okay.
[161:46.56]I'll be right back.
[161:48.32]See you in a minute.
[162:14.06]So,
[164:17.57]Thank you.
[166:03.57]I'm back.
[166:03.99]You guys ready to go back?
[166:25.29]Continue.
[166:35.92]So.
[166:38.10]What?
[166:40.43]What's next?
[166:52.30]Music's kind of louder than everybody else.
[166:56.86]I keep thinking it's going to open automatically.
[166:58.46]It just isn't.
[167:09.16]I like the sniper rifle a lot.
[167:11.77]Okay.
[167:44.06]Okay.
[167:52.21]I tried to run.
[167:58.01]Is this a weapons cache?
[168:05.48]No.
[168:09.10]It's like a reactor down here.
[168:10.27]This game's fucked up.
[168:22.95]Now you know.
[168:37.42]Get some rest.
[168:38.65]I've got your next mission in the briefing room.
[168:41.03]Head over there when you're ready.
[168:48.57]It would be so funny if it blew up right there.
[168:51.62]Do the double dropkick wrestling move to it.
[168:54.54]Press the button.
[169:05.75]Very well protected.
[169:21.60]I love how it just writes, stop.
[169:25.15]Stop it.
[169:27.00]Stop that.
[169:50.46]Are you even going to do that times 10 speed Breath of the Wild stream?
[169:58.95]It's a good in theory joke.
[170:01.45]But in practice, I'm not sure.
[170:06.45]That means no.
[170:18.94]Okay.
[170:19.16]Accessing memories.
[170:21.68]She's not telling you everything.
[170:26.38]Data package redacted.
[170:28.06]Upload complete.
[170:28.82]She's not telling you everything.
[170:31.23]Alright, well.
[170:43.71]Interesting.
[170:46.04]Is this the only thing you're going to play tonight?
[170:48.72]I was going to do browser game stuff, but this game is not very long from what I've heard.
[170:55.60]I heard this whole campaign is somewhere around like four to seven hours long.
[171:03.64]And I'm kind of into it, so I want to play it.
[171:10.45]We'll do browser stuff another time, don't worry.
[171:21.80]What was all that?
[171:26.11]Main story is about four and a half to five.
[171:28.65]Main and extra is seven.
[171:29.97]That makes sense.
[171:38.78]Hello.
[171:45.45]How do I get back in there?
[171:57.40]Alright, appearance.
[172:02.19]What's the simulator?
[172:06.03]Go to the gun range to get guns?
[172:14.68]Is it going to be at least an eight hour stream?
[172:17.58]Well, how many, what do we have here?
[172:18.88]We've got one, two.
[172:21.68]We did these two.
[172:23.82]three four but it's probably like five or six main missions yeah see side mission cool I think we can get this all done in one stream I'm not gonna go as fast as I can I'm not gonna just blow through it but it's definitely possible to do the main ones and then maybe one or two of the side ones
[172:53.77]Hack the servers and steal Horizon's classified information.
[172:57.13]Hack servers in Horizon's highly secure data center.
[173:01.40]Recovered files from the Pandora Institute show Horizon is collaborating with cultists.
[173:08.90]Cultists.
[173:10.44]Investigate the extent of their collaboration and destroy the cult.
[173:16.68]Side missions are wave defense missions mostly.
[173:19.15]Okay.
[173:21.09]We'll do the main ones.
[173:24.01]But I do want this... I don't think I unlocked very much.
[173:27.23]Let's just go for it.
[173:32.08]106, Raven here.
[173:33.10]I'll meet you at the helipad.
[173:36.40]106, this is Spectre 1.
[173:37.52]We'll meet you at the rendezvous point.
[173:41.92]Okay.
[173:47.85]Is this your favorite game ever?
[173:49.37]Check the gun range.
[173:55.34]We got.
[174:00.17]Rifle.
[174:04.67]Flash bangs.
[174:15.70]Hey, those are fun.
[174:37.84]Who's talking to me?
[174:41.86]Huh?
[174:48.85]Oh.
[174:50.93]Thanks.
[174:53.91]Alright, what do I want to bring?
[174:54.93]I like the... Can I take the sniper rifle?
[174:58.99]I want the sniper rifle.
[174:59.99]It's my favorite gun in the game.
[175:06.74]And that's why.
[175:07.26]It's too bad I missed.
[175:18.99]Shotgun's fun.
[175:21.51]But we'll do SMG as well.
[175:33.64]Resetting the range.
[175:36.94]It's fine.
[175:41.78]Folded stock.
[175:44.86]And suppressor?
[175:45.56]Yeah!
[175:47.41]What does it sound like?
[175:50.33]That sounds awesome.
[175:51.15]I love the way this sounds.
[175:51.83]Alright, I'm ready.
[176:03.63]I guess I can take armor and flashbangs?
[176:07.15]Why not?
[176:07.53]I get to keep these when I go on the mission, right?
[176:10.66]Sounds like a paint gun.
[176:12.48]This does a little bit, yeah.
[176:19.98]TF2 sniper.
[176:22.00]Maybe that's why I like it.
[176:23.08]It sounds like that.
[176:25.55]Alright, let's go outside.
[176:30.25]Those cultists are a bunch of freaks.
[176:32.95]You'll see what I'm talking about.
[176:34.23]Does folding the stock give any advantage in a game like this?
[176:40.22]It's not like the gun is going to bump into shit with the stock out.
[176:44.60]I think it was what?
[176:45.38]Recoil?
[176:45.78]Shooting, right?
[176:49.46]Here we go.
[176:50.28]Faster reload.
[176:51.79]Yep.
[177:05.08]This is an interesting mission.
[177:06.94]Like a gigantic mansion or something?
[177:10.97]Dwarvik Castle, Yorkshire, United Kingdom.
[177:14.15]Kill the cultist leader.
[177:16.07]Kill or capture the scientist Dr. Kramer.
[177:23.78]Interesting.
[177:35.88]Plenty of ammo.
[177:36.28]I'm going to turn the light off.
[177:48.34]Okay.
[177:49.02]Going down.
[177:49.48]I already have that weapon, right?
[177:59.91]Suppressor.
[178:00.49]Maybe I'll put it on the sniper.
[178:04.65]Yeah.
[178:14.04]What game should I play?
[178:14.92]There's not much time left.
[178:18.42]This one.
[178:30.87]That's a lazy answer.
[178:33.79]Is it though?
[178:34.49]This is a new game that just came out.
[178:36.93]It's very good.
[178:38.01]It's action packed.
[178:41.42]It's not that long.
[178:44.11]I think that was a perfect answer.
[178:45.15]Okay.
[179:11.02]His brain came out!
[179:12.02]His full brain!
[179:12.90]His full brain is indestructible!
[179:25.19]What the hell was that?
[179:37.00]Eat shit!
[179:43.39]Draw them out in the center so we can cover you!
[179:55.66]Die in agony, non-believers!
[180:09.48]Where are they?
[180:14.51]Where are they?
[180:16.09]What did that guy just do?
[180:26.82]Alright, that was pretty sick.
[180:29.76]I'm not going to lie.
[180:38.31]LZ is clear.
[180:40.78]You're gonna land here?
[180:42.44]What kind of weapons do these guys have?
[180:51.93]Shotguns?
[181:13.35]Oh, that one looks different.
[181:17.21]No, it's not.
[181:18.23]Keep going.
[181:23.89]Take the brain with you.
[181:27.99]It's like Left 4 Dead Gnome mission.
[181:29.81]Are they here?
[181:50.77]Nobody here.
[182:03.59]Game looks sick.
[182:06.17]I would tell you it is sick.
[182:12.49]Intel beware like those who destroy you too shall become.
[182:22.68]I'm having fun with it so far.
[182:23.50]I think the only real complaint that you could have is it's not that long from everything that I've been shown.
[182:34.60]But there's there, this is it right here.
[182:37.61]Can I get this right now?
[182:39.71]It's just, it's this guy right here.
[182:42.43]This is the guy.
[182:44.21]That's the guy.
[182:44.65]Oh, wait.
[183:11.48]Yeah, also, I'm also a proponent of length does not determine if a game is any good.
[183:18.43]I would rather have a really fun, really polished, like six to ten hour game than a just junk filled slog of like a 20 plus hour game.
[183:39.46]Where are they?
[183:46.46]I didn't aggro the main guy.
[183:48.32]So I guess I can kind of keep sneaking around.
[183:56.92]Nobody saw me come in here.
[183:59.60]He hates Elden Ring.
[184:03.95]Hold on.
[184:05.53]Elden Ring is like one of the best video games ever made.
[184:08.91]Besides Millenia and Redan.
[184:10.77]Pre-patch.
[184:21.74]Today marks my first day as an apprentice.
[184:23.52]I have left my old life behind, including my job at Horizon.
[184:27.30]I made this decision not just for myself, but for my wife, Martha, and our unborn child.
[184:32.75]I believe that the patriarch prefers something not that my old life could not.
[184:40.37]True, somebody else can read.
[184:58.42]Alright, they're here somewhere.
[185:02.26]That guy's still alive.
[185:20.17]I only shot that guy in the groin.
[185:23.17]I could...
[185:25.83]That guy threw up in the balcony, did like four Tony Hawk pro skater moves.
[185:36.33]Oh, I fucked him up so bad.
[185:40.50]He's up there.
[185:41.12]I don't think he knows what's going on.
[186:21.47]It's whole brain again.
[186:34.30]Yeah.
[186:44.94]You dead?
[187:03.29]Oh, God.
[187:06.02]I'll try it one more time.
[187:17.09]Printer music?
[187:18.49]What does printer music mean?
[187:26.08]It sounds like... Hold on.
[187:30.82]Listen, listen, listen.
[187:40.03]Oh, crap!
[187:55.13]Oh shit.
[188:01.54]I still got it when it's still in the air.
[188:12.28]I killed that guy.
[188:13.56]OK.
[188:21.57]This sound this you saying is a printer.
[188:26.86]Like an old printer?
[188:29.66]I guess, maybe a little.
[188:36.62]Intel.
[188:39.85]Three sets of 12 reps of push-ups using the edge of a table.
[188:44.47]Three sets of 12 reps of pull-ups using the edge of a table.
[188:47.95]Three sets of 12 reps of lunges using a stack of books.
[188:51.90]Three sets of 12 reps of military press using heavy books.
[188:56.99]That's how you become Saitama.
[188:59.41]So you become strong.
[189:02.06]That's the secret.
[189:04.56]Masks and robes must remain on during PT.
[189:07.76]We do not stretch or warm up.
[189:09.96]We train as we fight.
[189:11.42]It actually is bald.
[189:27.54]Alright, where am I going?
[189:37.70]I'm now five days into my apprenticeship at the cult's hall, and I must say, the schedule is quite rigorous.
[189:43.46]Rising at the crack of dawn, praying for four hours, fasting, and so on.
[189:48.22]It takes some getting used to, but I believe it is for the greater good.
[189:51.92]The hall itself is quite impressive, but where are all the women and children?
[189:55.27]Martha's not enjoying herself much here, but I'm sure she will accustom herself in due time.
[189:59.55]I thought that said Thanos.
[190:15.07]Are you... What the hell do you... Are you a... I'm gonna die from this motherfucker.
[190:20.05]He's gonna kill me.
[190:23.95]What the fuck?
[190:24.95]This guy's super powered.
[190:26.93]That guy is super human.
[190:28.79]He was literally unrecognizably fucking burnt.
[190:33.94]That... Okay, that was terrifying.
[190:41.14]Holy shit.
[190:45.50]That guy almost killed me.
[190:58.42]What the fuck was that?
[191:00.62]He's stuck on them.
[191:19.37]That was fucked.
[191:22.40]That was so loud.
[191:23.68]That hurt my head.
[191:29.86]We're just knocking a ton of shit over, aren't we?
[191:36.77]Farewell.
[191:52.27]I once got to get killed by a chair, don't you?
[192:11.92]I love this game.
[192:12.78]It's great.
[192:19.84]OK, now where was I going?
[192:32.35]Briefcase.
[192:40.29]Please unfold this for the love of God.
[192:42.33]I'm fine.
[192:43.03]It's good.
[192:43.43]It's fine.
[192:46.51]Where am I going?
[192:48.74]I actually don't know where I'm going.
[193:00.14]There it is, right?
[193:01.08]No.
[193:15.03]What are you doing the BLT stream?
[193:17.27]Hold on.
[193:18.09]I got to pay attention to where I'm going.
[193:19.19]Shit.
[193:32.54]Where am I going?
[193:33.64]I came down this way.
[193:36.67]Right?
[193:38.01]Yeah.
[193:39.27]Is this the right?
[193:41.37]Yeah, this is right.
[193:48.23]They're all still screaming hold on I can get it
[194:45.60]You alive?
[194:46.14]This guy, look at him.
[194:48.10]This guy's so burnt.
[194:51.62]Alright, I've had enough of that.
[195:11.03]Oh, Jesus!
[195:25.12]They're spinning around!
[195:36.64]Oh, they were in like a... They're only a carousel, that out of control carousel.
[195:42.50]Holding on for their lives while the thing spun a million miles per hour.
[195:45.56]They're on a roller coaster.
[195:55.05]I'm just going all the way.
[196:04.29]Alright, die!
[196:22.98]They're still alive!
[196:26.54]I'm just running up these fucking stairs.
[196:28.72]Get away from me!
[196:29.74]Get out of here!
[196:31.92]Stop!
[196:42.19]That's the guy!
[196:43.53]That's the fucking boss!
[196:46.17]This is the boss!
[196:56.21]This is fucking mayhem.
[196:58.37]Alright.
[197:03.87]I'm just going up there.
[197:04.97]Fuck it.
[197:05.45]I don't care.
[197:06.05]Follow me all I care.
[197:08.30]Come on.
[197:36.13]Jesus I have to relax because I'm I'm gonna like fucking freak Okay, let's go
[198:09.13]Alright, now go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[198:11.27]That's enough, that's enough, that's enough, that's enough.
[198:17.60]He's right here.
[198:18.32]Dude, what's your head made out of, dude?
[198:31.47]What is your head made out of?
[198:32.67]Did I get him?
[198:37.17]Is he dead?
[198:37.61]Oh shit, they're all still here!
[198:40.09]I... Oh my... Wait.
[198:54.65]Go, go, go, go, go.
[198:55.47]I killed him.
[198:55.83]I got him, I got him, I got him.
[199:04.86]I don't know.
[199:05.22]Just go.
[199:05.58]Just go.
[199:05.94]Go.
[199:06.10]Go.
[199:06.24]Just go.
[199:06.67]Just go.
[199:07.61]Just go.
[199:14.15]I already killed the guy.
[199:14.99]Go away.
[199:53.37]Wait, he's still alive!
[200:04.14]Where is this guy?
[200:07.26]But he has magical spells?
[200:24.03]Whoa, you got a different gun.
[200:25.13]And this thing looks crazy.
[200:26.07]All units be advised.
[200:30.59]The enforcer has been eliminated.
[200:34.69]That was fucking insane.
[200:37.15]That was a lot of fun.
[200:38.61]Get your hats off me, you fuckwits!
[200:43.83]Bastards!
[200:45.27]Dr. Kramer's in custody.
[200:48.08]We're on our way back to the courtyard for extraction.
[200:49.88]Did we get him?
[200:53.64]Director, we've got unidentified helos closing in fast.
[200:57.86]Oh shit, it's Horizon!
[200:59.68]They're landing everywhere!
[201:01.44]We'll try to hold them off, but we're going to need backup ASAP!
[201:05.16]God damn it, I can't shoot through this.
[201:06.60]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[201:08.85]How do I get out of here?
[201:10.03]How do I get out of here?
[201:12.03]How do I get out of here?
[201:12.63]Oh!
[201:38.13]They come to you.
[201:38.75]Intel?
[201:39.05]Okay, I got it.
[202:08.46]Can I do something with this gun?
[202:12.58]Two smart gun.
[202:14.16]That's funny.
[202:20.01]Kind of out of ammo for this thing.
[202:26.27]Swap it.
[202:37.81]ham a full ham thing is still bloody can I eat it the gas coming in the room
[203:43.42]It was kind of funny.
[203:58.06]Somebody said get really close to a wall and throw them in.
[204:18.20]Kind of funny.
[204:24.93]Look at all this literature.
[204:26.09]Yeah.
[204:37.23]Oh my, what are you doing?
[204:42.10]I just didn't feel like shooting the gun, because it was going to take too long to rev up the gun, which was two or three seconds too long, and I thought I could just jump over it.
[204:52.96]That's a bad place to spawn.
[205:29.88]Here I come.
[205:51.49]That was some banjo kazooie shit there.
[206:13.08]We're good?
[206:14.72]Don't do that.
[206:21.91]You just killed somebody on your own team.
[206:44.84]Why are you playing an FPS you've changed bro?
[206:57.26]Oh shit
[207:13.53]Somebody's talking next to my head.
[207:14.81]That was weird.
[207:16.31]What the hell was that?
[207:40.87]Did I just bounce back into it?
[207:42.35]I was going to say, please don't.
[207:43.59]OK, I need ammo.
[208:03.33]Ages ago, I left my old life as a soldier behind in search of something greater.
[208:07.03]I joined not only because of my beliefs, but also because it gave me a sense of belonging and fulfillment.
[208:19.44]Oh sorry, I had a drink.
[208:22.00]Halfway through that.
[208:43.01]Auto fully automatic pistol.
[208:51.75]I'm going to take it.
[208:53.91]Because I want to try it.
[208:55.20]Alright, where's game progress up here?
[209:21.92]What?
[209:22.36]Where you at?
[209:52.65]Where you at?
[210:01.90]Spare me the sin of killing another brother.
[210:06.06]My precious warrior monks.
[210:09.55]Oh, he's in this room.
[210:10.77]You arrived seeking answers.
[210:14.65]As your supreme patriarch, I- Read my warning.
[210:19.19]Leave.
[210:26.10]What?
[210:26.50]What is that?
[210:27.04]Like an automatic shotgun?
[210:28.52]What is this thing?
[211:00.27]My impression.
[211:07.74]What's up?
[211:11.68]Let's go!
[211:20.66]Who's on my team?
[211:21.78]Hey, you on my team?
[211:24.81]Are we up?
[211:25.41]No, we're not.
[211:44.58]Who's on my team?
[211:45.38]What was that?
[211:47.74]That was a grenade.
[211:49.48]This is a grenade launcher.
[211:51.20]Alright, I get it.
[211:56.72]Who's on my team?
[211:57.97]Hey, you're on my team.
[212:03.97]My precious.
[212:06.95]I get it now.
[212:07.39]106, we could use some help here.
[212:10.59]Arise and seek in the courtyard.
[212:33.97]That's us.
[212:35.13]Alright, here we go.
[213:00.50]They sound like orcs or something when it's slowed down.
[213:30.23]DayZ right now.
[213:31.21]Just get him.
[213:31.77]Go in and kill him.
[213:32.59]It's like, can I get him?
[213:36.86]He's across the map.
[213:37.52]Can I hit him?
[213:38.24]Oh, shit.
[213:38.48]I'm not very good.
[213:40.36]This guy's still talking.
[214:02.55]And in my absence.
[214:07.81]What?
[214:08.19]Oh.
[214:13.55]Who's with me?
[214:18.63]I'm bringing one pistol in here.
[214:21.73]Is the neti pot stream after this?
[214:24.65]What on Earth are you talking about?
[214:28.90]Wait, are you talking about how I used a neti pot once when I was sick like two, three years ago?
[214:36.19]What on Earth are you referring to?
[214:43.83]This is goofy.
[214:44.53]I like it.
[214:44.93]This is a goofy weapon now.
[214:56.26]I like it a lot.
[215:02.42]This thing's empty.
[215:03.14]You are goofy.
[215:03.84]Hey, it's fun.
[215:04.46]What was that beep?
[215:05.90]I'm not standing on a landmine, right?
[215:10.46]I need a new gun.
[215:33.02]That's a positive ID on one of Spectre 3's men.
[215:37.07]Let's see if we can find the rest of his team.
[215:44.17]I'm not trying to be an asshole here.
[215:45.73]I'm sorry.
[215:46.21]I'm just... You're stuck on me.
[215:47.65]Every day, you sharpen your swords, sharpen your minds, purge blasphemous influences from your lives.
[216:08.05]I want to sneak up behind this guy and just... just to whip him in the back of the head once.
[216:16.31]Can I do that?
[216:17.13]I hope I can.
[216:17.79]Dagger 3, this is Central.
[216:23.29]Come in.
[216:24.65]Do you read?
[216:26.21]Dammit.
[216:26.57]If you're reading this, rendezvous with Dagger 5.
[216:33.07]Bro, you had your volume up way too loud.
[216:37.61]That's like you thought you were turning it off, but you turned it all the way up.
[216:49.65]Ooh.
[216:50.69]Can I do anything?
[216:52.21]No.
[216:52.37]No.
[217:04.73]Incendiary incendiary what?
[217:10.58]Shotgun.
[217:25.79]Take a look at the Intel.
[217:28.99]Doctor Kramer.
[217:31.40]I'm now supervising the cult's experiments.
[217:33.10]It's my job to gather data and assess if there's anything usable in their insane methods.
[217:38.64]I report every 30 minutes if I miss one or if my heart rate monitor goes too high, a Black Ops team will arrive and kill everyone, leaving no traces behind.
[217:47.75]I must regain... I must remain objective.
[217:50.63]Cultists are fanatical and delusional, but there's a chance that some of the methods may prove useful.
[217:58.21]If your heart rate goes too high...
[218:03.02]So I can't exercise.
[218:04.12]I can't watch... I can't watch Tenet.
[218:09.38]I can't, um... I mean, there's a lot of things I can't do.
[218:13.22]That's kind of unfortunate.
[218:19.55]You can't... Alright, we're gonna move on.
[218:24.45]Incendiary on shotgun?
[218:25.81]Oh, I don't think I can do it.
[218:27.89]Can I?
[218:29.31]Oh my goodness, I can.
[218:30.73]How did I not see that?
[218:32.10]Thank you.
[218:39.32]This might be it.
[218:47.62]He's dead?
[218:52.79]Jesus.
[219:06.89]Uh, shotgun or, I mean, grenade launcher.
[219:10.18]Let's just, whatever.
[219:11.52]I'm doing grenade launcher.
[219:12.40]Can I pick up these knives?
[219:18.48]Ooh, cool.
[219:25.00]I'm beginning to feel skeptical about the cult experiments.
[219:27.78]It's clear that their methods are dangerous and unsound, and I have yet to see any real progress.
[219:33.29]Perhaps they were not entirely honest with their promises.
[219:41.00]I'm kind of concerned I have no bullets, but I'm going to make them count.
[219:55.21]A lot of health here.
[219:56.09]This is
[220:14.44]Okay.
[220:14.98]I have like 10 shots.
[220:15.74]This guy here?
[220:16.62]No.
[220:52.16]Is it you?
[220:52.54]How do I get up?
[221:36.47]On the stairs.
[221:36.83]Check the helmet cam?
[222:07.15]There he is.
[222:07.61]Not just that, he's also a magician.
[222:18.15]Really?
[222:19.89]Where are they approaching from?
[222:22.53]There OK.
[222:41.10]What's up?
[222:43.76]That was a huge first shot.
[222:45.40]It killed almost everybody.
[222:46.34]What?
[223:10.61]Let's go.
[223:25.70]Anymore out there across the way.
[223:29.97]I want to throwing knife somebody right ahead.
[223:44.63]How many grenades are over here?
[223:46.19]That was like ten.
[223:48.96]What?
[223:49.42]Did you see the indicator?
[223:50.90]That was like at least six.
[223:54.62]Whoa.
[223:55.50]You gotta be kidding me.
[224:12.59]Alright, let's do a clean this time.
[224:14.07]Where are they?
[224:34.76]Where are they?
[224:48.29]Is one guy just sitting in here in the kitchen or something?
[225:10.15]Go back to the helmet.
[225:19.63]I think I might have broke it.
[225:23.68]He's right there.
[225:33.12]I think I broke it.
[225:46.73]Wait.
[225:49.60]Was it that guy?
[226:05.05]Here we go.
[226:19.60]I think we're good now.
[226:21.08]Yeah.
[226:34.93]Ooh, we're in the heavy?
[226:49.22]That sucked!
[226:50.06]What the hell?
[227:14.96]He landed horizontally with his back.
[227:19.18]Dude.
[227:19.50]Oh, I think that was a bug.
[227:21.46]That was a bug.
[227:37.17]Somebody's still alive.
[227:46.60]How come your feet are glowing red?
[227:48.08]Uh, because I got the fire flower.
[227:51.96]That's why these have fire on them.
[227:56.09]It's a nice touch that they added it.
[227:58.93]Where are you?
[228:19.76]Oh, there you are.
[228:34.76]Jesus!
[228:48.33]I got to bring you all the way around the house.
[228:49.73]You're going to get stuck in here.
[228:50.57]Watch this.
[228:50.91]Okay, bro has no idea where I am.
[228:58.76]Yes, he does.
[229:12.21]Don't let him grab you.
[229:24.71]Oh shit, I thought I was being sneaky.
[229:36.64]I was being sneaky.
[229:37.48]Alright, well now knowing that I need a different gun because this thing has no bullets.
[229:47.30]Anything on the ground?
[229:51.33]I might be in trouble.
[230:05.44]Well, let's try again.
[230:08.76]Gianni is carrying this entire mission.
[230:10.48]His work is so good.
[230:12.73]Oh, the voice work.
[230:13.49]Yeah.
[230:16.05]Oh, you better believe it.
[230:26.74]How did that miss?
[230:27.38]It went right through his armpit.
[230:45.15]Where is he?
[230:50.29]He's destroying this whole place.
[231:10.92]Watch out!
[231:12.18]Watch out!
[231:16.77]Watch out!
[231:19.11]There's another gun on the ground.
[231:27.33]Shit!
[231:38.22]Invisibility is so useful here.
[231:48.62]Jesus.
[232:00.46]That's a lot of grenades.
[232:14.04]Shit.
[232:15.66]Don't get stuck on that.
[232:16.98]Come on, man.
[232:31.68]Get out of my way, bed!
[232:32.48]Got him.
[232:50.07]Ugh.
[232:50.21]Almost down to the last bullet.
[233:02.13]Final bullet.
[233:03.45]Nice.
[233:07.83]This game is intense.
[233:09.09]I can't imagine doing this on something harder than very hard.
[233:20.91]If you die instantly in rage mode.
[233:26.42]I feel like that's going to be extraordinarily difficult.
[233:31.22]Extreme was not too hard to do.
[233:34.08]I wonder if Rage Mode is.
[233:41.61]I wonder what the strategy is to actually do this on Rage Mode.
[233:45.43]Like, what weapon is it?
[233:46.19]Or what series of weapons?
[233:48.59]Is that not the right way?
[233:57.16]Oh.
[234:05.86]Um, wait though.
[234:08.38]I ran over a weapon and I need, there it is.
[234:13.25]I already have a shotgun.
[234:20.23]Okay.
[234:26.40]Is there no other weapon on the ground?
[234:27.80]I really only have one bullet to kill this guy.
[234:34.81]That's it.
[234:37.03]I swear I saw another gun.
[234:39.11]There it is.
[234:39.47]Alright, there we are.
[234:53.16]Creepy.
[234:55.04]Jesus!
[234:55.34]Oh, he slowed down time!
[235:06.38]You slowed time down.
[235:08.02]I get it.
[235:08.84]He's doing the same powers that I am.
[235:15.71]That's interesting.
[235:33.38]Kind of sounds like somebody's listening to like a really intense movie in the other room.
[235:36.52]I'll take this thing.
[235:40.60]Yeah, look at this thing.
[236:05.25]Still doing browser games?
[236:07.15]Um, probably not.
[236:09.73]I don't think so.
[236:10.21]I think it's going to take me all the way to the next hour or two to beat this.
[236:14.16]Dual weld.
[236:16.16]I got it.
[236:17.74]Dual weld serum.
[236:23.94]I love how you have to inject yourself to be able to hold two guns.
[236:26.68]That's funny.
[236:34.94]H. Find another weapon of the same type.
[236:37.83]Will two at the same time.
[236:39.03]Oh boy.
[236:47.37]How do you shoot them both?
[236:49.22]They both just fire.
[236:54.46]I'll try this for now.
[237:03.57]Two shotguns.
[237:07.01]How do I switch weapons?
[237:09.97]Dual shotgun?
[237:12.19]I feel like this would be great.
[237:16.50]Yeah, I'm alright with this.
[237:19.92]Can I even pick up?
[237:20.58]I don't think I have two shotguns here.
[237:22.30]I don't have enough ammo for it either.
[237:30.99]Yeah, I'm good with this.
[237:42.72]Dual auto weapons have insane recoil.
[237:46.86]Find out.
[237:51.93]Don't fall down there.
[238:04.80]Who's shooting?
[238:10.20]I just kicked that guy's fucking chin off.
[238:24.08]Holy fuck What the hell
[238:47.86]I don't even know who did that.
[238:49.24]I'm not even sure that was supposed to happen, but it did happen.
[238:53.69]I'm not entirely sure what just happened.
[239:11.33]Got him.
[239:25.13]Oh my fucking God.
[239:35.73]OK, relax for a sec.
[239:38.21]Don't you dare.
[239:55.06]Get away.
[240:01.93]Who's left?
[240:02.55]Oh, come on, dude.
[240:18.43]What the hell?
[240:21.19]Come on.
[240:27.92]I was trying not to hit him.
[240:29.22]I was trying to have it bounce where their feet were.
[240:35.09]Somebody said, this game makes you really feel like a Gagata.
[240:39.13]True.
[240:47.84]Oh my god, that was brutal.
[241:02.12]I think he said, oh no.
[241:03.66]I can't even react, dude.
[241:07.63]It's fucking too much going on.
[241:11.19]Oh no!
[241:49.60]I'm alright.
[241:53.66]Fiddlesticks?
[241:55.39]Did he actually say fiddlesticks?
[241:56.89]No, he didn't.
[242:07.62]You piece of shit.
[242:08.72]That was so perfect of a throw.
[242:10.22]I hate your guts.
[242:21.05]I'm not even doing that.
[242:21.93]I just did the fucking Luigi from Mario 2.
[242:34.58]I just pulled off a Yoshi midair.
[242:38.26]They're falling back.
[242:43.32]This is our only chance.
[242:44.58]106, you need to get to that monster.
[242:49.55]Oh, okay.
[242:51.97]Go now?
[242:53.05]You want to go now?
[242:59.12]Wait, let me get all the ammo.
[243:00.69]I got plenty.
[243:02.35]I'm good.
[243:21.79]I think those are gonna fall down.
[243:29.92]Somebody's head came down here.
[243:33.98]Hey!
[243:34.84]Watch where you're throwing those.
[243:45.77]Somebody's arm.
[243:56.93]Oh shit!
[244:09.24]Nobody else is gonna come down here, right?
[244:11.63]It's so dusty!
[244:17.57]What's going on up there?
[244:25.51]I think somebody just said shut the fuck up.
[244:34.45]Alright, the dust is... Wait!
[244:45.88]Oh!
[244:48.72]Two guys right there!
[244:49.64]Are you guys okay?
[244:59.21]Dude, I think that guy was alive.
[245:06.84]They're getting too close to the edge.
[245:16.68]Those are our teammates.
[245:25.83]Okay.
[245:28.18]Alright, I think we can move on.
[245:29.96]I mean, it's still mayhem up there, but... Three stooges war.
[245:39.84]That- What was that?
[245:41.75]What was that?
[245:42.33]That was like somebody's thumb.
[245:46.49]What is that?
[245:48.85]It's somebody's shoe.
[246:06.39]This is crazy.
[246:07.31]Dude, the loafers just got ruined.
[246:15.96]How much more men do they have?
[246:17.36]Oh shit, are you alright?
[246:25.49]I'm kind of hoping somebody lands down here and is alive.
[246:42.00]Alright, they're actually... They're starting to get smart.
[246:45.04]They're starting to get smart.
[246:50.64]What happens if they run out of ammo?
[246:52.00]Can they run out of ammo?
[247:02.18]Where's my grenade?
[247:05.57]Hey, hey!
[247:19.25]I got to get out of here.
[247:20.55]I have to move on.
[247:21.53]This is going to keep happening forever.
[247:46.10]Alright, that's fun.
[247:50.41]Sneaky.
[247:53.23]That was kind of fun.
[248:04.80]Oh, they're done.
[248:12.00]Penetrator.
[248:13.86]Ooh, what's that?
[248:15.78]Uh, no.
[248:16.40]Definitely keep this.
[248:20.91]All everything.
[248:25.31]The actor is left.
[248:26.31]Yeah, that's true.
[248:32.74]That was very enjoyable.
[248:35.87]What the fuck?
[248:36.71]Somebody burped in my ear.
[248:55.14]Oh.
[249:01.30]Those were my guys, were they?
[249:08.74]What the hell, man?
[249:09.96]I didn't know they were my guys.
[249:11.13]There's the belt again.
[249:27.30]My game just crashed.
[249:41.43]What do I do now?
[249:47.39]Hold on.
[249:52.71]Oh.
[249:52.83]I have to restart the game.
[250:00.85]This game is... This game is very good.
[250:16.54]I love this game.
[250:18.70]It's very fun.
[250:19.62]What was that?
[250:23.91]What the hell was that?
[250:24.75]Was that the game?
[250:29.01]What's happening?
[250:39.03]Are we good?
[250:39.61]Are we good?
[250:46.61]I think we're good.
[250:47.87]Alright, let's go.
[250:48.95]We're gonna go!
[251:13.22]All the way up.
[251:20.14]Whoa!
[251:21.44]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, come here.
[251:34.33]My weapon is jammed!
[251:40.65]Hold fire!
[251:47.77]I'm out of ammo.
[251:53.30]There's so many people over here.
[251:54.84]What am I doing?
[251:55.54]Alright, let's go.
[252:26.65]doing get away from me get out of the way get out of the way get out of the way get out of the way
[253:01.22]Here we go.
[253:09.47]Why has my gun forsaken me?
[253:23.23]Oh!
[253:24.77]Feels like I'm listening to Tom and Jerry, somebody said.
[253:43.65]Dude, I need health so bad.
[253:45.74]I have no ammo.
[253:46.68]I have no ammo.
[253:47.48]I have no ammo.
[253:48.32]I have no ammo.
[253:49.16]I have no ammo.
[253:50.52]I have no ammo.
[254:44.29]Oh, I didn't get them all.
[254:45.55]Shit.
[254:47.78]It's alright.
[254:48.48]Ready?
[254:51.02]There's way too many!
[254:53.20]Oh, fuck off.
[254:54.24]Damn it.
[254:56.06]Alright, I gotta get a different gun.
[255:08.23]I'm using too many bullets.
[255:10.43]I gotta conserve bullets.
[255:19.82]right here here we go better
[256:04.02]so far.
[256:08.70]I just launched my don't go off the edge.
[256:21.31]Oh my God.
[256:49.72]Better.
[256:50.00]OK, assess assess.
[256:59.73]Get rid of that.
[257:01.47]Here it is.
[257:08.60]I'm going to hold off of that now.
[257:10.56]Let's just use this thing for now.
[257:14.16]Auto save here.
[257:14.90]OK, am I going down?
[257:19.69]I leveled target.
[257:29.15]Got him.
[257:41.42]Who's got the smoke?
[257:51.95]WHAT?!
[258:00.89]Shit.
[258:07.24]Oh, thank goodness.
[258:07.92]Alright, we're fine.
[258:08.46]Everyone, everyone, relax.
[258:22.38]Perfectly cut screen.
[258:27.00]It was intense and I did not expect it.
[258:34.84]What the fuck?
[258:54.60]You know what?
[259:07.23]Oh, I thought those were green.
[259:10.19]Sorry.
[259:10.65]These are fine.
[259:11.03]You know what?
[259:11.67]Throw these anyways.
[259:13.85]Get rid of them.
[259:23.92]What's up?
[259:37.39]Always right there.
[259:42.33]Alright.
[259:43.29]Last time.
[260:04.58]I could do double shotgun, but there's not enough ammo.
[260:07.54]So I'm going to stick with this.
[260:08.78]I have plenty of this ammo.
[260:14.65]I think I'm good.
[260:26.31]How far into the game are you?
[260:27.53]I don't know.
[260:32.54]I could put a dual weld on here.
[260:34.30]That's exactly what I'm going to do.
[260:45.51]Alright, let's go.
[260:47.40]Boss time.
[261:08.77]Okay.
[261:29.14]Where'd he go?
[261:29.48]Alright, we're going to just expel all the weapons.
[261:32.76]I just unloaded so much.
[261:44.89]I'm just throwing whatever I got over here.
[261:53.62]I'm just throwing.
[262:04.64]Get out of here.
[262:18.81]What is it?
[262:20.54]I just threw an axe.
[262:37.66]Good strat.
[262:40.40]Oh, it hurts.
[262:49.41]What the fuck did that guy come from?
[262:58.84]Where did that guy?
[262:59.68]Is that another one?
[263:05.17]Oh, shit.
[263:05.53]We're right in the middle of this.
[263:17.14]It's too much stimulation.
[263:18.06]It's way too much stimulation right now.
[263:20.30]I don't even have any ammo.
[263:28.62]It's too much stimulation.
[263:44.11]Is there enemies?
[263:52.42]Is that thing still alive?
[263:59.86]Die!
[264:07.38]Fuck!
[264:17.56]Shit.
[264:18.15]It's alright.
[264:18.43]We're right here.
[264:43.48]It's too much.
[264:44.80]There's too much going on.
[264:46.60]It's just carnage.
[264:47.96]It's just mayhem.
[264:51.91]Stop moaning?
[264:54.07]That's not me.
[264:55.06]That's them.
[264:55.96]That's them doing that.
[264:57.44]Is that not me?
[264:58.56]I don't know.
[264:58.90]Am I doing that?
[265:00.34]I can't tell.
[265:00.96]It's intense.
[265:01.56]Alright.
[265:07.55]I got to do this.
[265:08.11]This guy's going to die right now.
[265:13.63]Did he jump out the window?
[265:30.49]He's dead.
[265:30.85]Alright, alright, alright.
[265:31.61]I got it.
[265:31.91]I got it.
[265:32.39]I'll get it now.
[265:40.74]He's alive.
[265:44.34]He's alive.
[265:49.14]Get me the fuck away from him.
[266:05.35]Reload the gun.
[266:15.52]Fuck you.
[266:22.88]Oh.
[266:27.09]Oh.
[266:29.19]Where is he?
[266:54.69]Stop moaning.
[266:55.95]I'm going to be... You've been breathing... Break the cycle.
[267:03.37]You've been breathing so loud.
[267:05.07]It's an intense game.
[267:06.44]You have a microphone right next to my mouth.
[267:09.52]When you're sitting there gaming, when you're gaming it up real hard, there's no microphone sitting right here.
[267:15.66]Just like, oh, let's get every fucking breath that comes out of his mouth.
[267:23.14]That was intense, this one.
[267:26.93]What a fucking mission, sir.
[267:32.36]Chill stream.
[267:39.70]I'm chilling out.
[267:41.76]Stuff can be intense and still just be kind of operating at like 70% or so.
[267:47.48]I'm just hanging out.
[267:50.92]Not much time left for morning, huh?
[267:54.32]Yeah, you get used to it.
[267:59.78]Dude, you're screaming.
[268:05.32]Yeah, but... I don't know.
[268:14.98]Chill mindset.
[268:15.94]Chill stream is a mindset.
[268:17.22]Yeah.
[268:18.94]It's definitely a mindset.
[268:23.92]I think when I say chill streams, I think what I mean is
[268:28.45]Usually no cam.
[268:30.37]And just whatever happens, I'm just gonna play.
[268:34.07]And I'm not really paying attention to much else.
[268:36.95]Just looking over chat every now and then.
[268:39.27]The game is intense, that's fine.
[268:46.58]Just means he's naked.
[268:50.90]I think I'm just going, I go into these more when I say chill stream.
[268:56.45]With the intention of being dialed down like 30% or so.
[269:03.67]And plus it is 110 degrees.
[269:04.99]It's very hot out right now.
[269:06.20]So yeah, I don't have any upper clothing on.
[269:08.70]Oh wait, I want to see the... I think I can do it from here.
[269:23.02]this site 83 Russia so I'm going to assume there's probably two missions left the green from what one guy in chat said is these are wave missions
[269:51.14]I'm going to imagine another one opens up somewhere around here.
[269:55.11]Some of them are.
[270:00.19]I'm going to go pee one more time.
[270:02.48]Maybe more than once.
[270:05.48]It's cool.
[270:05.76]I like these.
[270:06.18]These are a lot like your older streams.
[270:08.54]That's part of the intention too.
[270:10.98]Is just kind of turning something on and just hanging out and doing whatever.
[270:16.12]We do a lot of wacky kind of crazy shit here, but I don't want that to be the only thing that anyone can ever anticipate here.
[270:27.25]If that makes sense.
[270:33.67]And again, the whole off-brand stuff.
[270:35.53]Kind of splitting up time between having a job and everything.
[270:42.05]I have a job now.
[270:45.50]But yeah, I'll be right back.
[270:46.80]We'll keep going.
[270:47.62]Site 83.
[270:47.91]As long as you're having fun.
[270:49.93]Oh yeah, for sure.
[270:52.29]He has Omeglel, a job.
[270:54.27]Alright, be right back. ...
[271:37.23]Thank you.
[272:34.18]Thank you.
[273:13.70]Thank you.
[274:06.83]I am back.
[274:10.30]Oh hold on, I forgot my drink.
[274:42.84]Alright, let's keep going.
[274:45.60]Site 83 is the next one.
[274:55.23]Repurpose this former Soviet military base into a research facility.
[274:59.07]Nearby civilians were evacuated earlier today under the cover of a gas leak.
[275:03.49]We're sending you in with a small team.
[275:06.61]I'll be
[275:13.00]Okay.
[275:15.52]I do want to play around with the weapons for a second.
[275:21.95]Where's that area to do that in?
[275:24.29]A deadly nerve agent.
[275:46.20]Here it is.
[275:48.02]Alright, bolt launcher.
[275:56.02]Rat bombs.
[276:00.24]Some of these you have to actually beat on high difficulty.
[276:08.83]Bolt launcher.
[276:11.77]What?
[276:14.38]That's what this does?
[276:18.09]I thought this was a shotgun.
[276:19.29]Okay, it's not a shotgun.
[276:26.05]What else can you do?
[276:28.87]Penetrator.
[276:31.22]More accurate and powerful non-explosive bolts.
[276:33.70]Single fire.
[276:34.52]How does that work?
[276:41.36]That was just a very, very... It's like a magnum.
[276:44.25]It's like a Resident Evil Magnum.
[276:56.85]Pretty good.
[276:59.73]Doesn't have a lot of ammo though.
[277:00.81]Pretty low.
[277:05.54]I'll try it.
[277:08.66]It's a comedy gun.
[277:18.13]Does that mean I can have two of them?
[277:24.02]Aww.
[277:25.20]You can't use two of them?
[277:26.66]Okay.
[277:29.38]I actually like these.
[277:33.70]Take the suppressor off.
[277:38.93]Got two shotguns?
[277:40.39]Yeah, let's do that.
[277:53.77]Excuse me.
[278:15.42]That's an easy way to get them out of the way.
[278:19.74]I just died in a place where you shouldn't... You can't even die.
[278:30.20]What just happened?
[278:35.60]I couldn't pick up the shotguns on the ground.
[278:42.19]You saw me try at least a few times.
[278:44.21]I tried.
[278:46.85]My theory was I could throw a grenade and they would get out of the way.
[278:49.65]And it was kind of true.
[279:00.40]We haven't done this in a while.
[279:05.39]Ooh.
[279:07.85]Moody.
[279:10.51]Keep the red shoes.
[279:11.23]Let's do that.
[279:24.09]Alright.
[279:24.39]Now let's go back to what I was going to do.
[279:31.50]Okay.
[279:33.68]Shotgun.
[279:35.46]Shotgun again.
[279:36.08]There it is.
[279:44.41]So how does this work?
[279:47.88]That's wacky.
[280:00.65]I kind of don't like it though.
[280:12.15]We'll go bolt launcher and the double SMG.
[280:22.49]No suppressor, no nothing.
[280:26.55]But I do want this to have the penetrator on.
[280:32.92]Can you dual snipers?
[280:36.54]I probably not.
[280:38.26]But let's say it if I can.
[280:43.39]Dual snipers would be strange.
[280:49.07]You could fire one of those quicker than just dual welding.
[280:51.02]Yeah, that's what it feels like.
[280:53.70]Alright, let's go.
[281:06.34]Is there anything else you can do up here?
[281:07.50]Or is it just these three things?
[281:10.98]How do I get in this room again?
[281:27.49]How do I get this wrong every... Oh, there it is.
[281:34.21]Alright.
[281:35.29]Site 83.
[281:35.57]Let's do it.
[281:49.22]I will say I do have a hard out in about an hour.
[281:54.30]I don't know if I'm going to be able to beat the whole thing in one sitting here.
[281:58.92]I'm not going to rush.
[282:01.78]You know what?
[282:03.08]You kind of remind me of the last guy I flew.
[282:09.67]I have a hard out.
[282:12.11]Somewhere around 830 Pacific I have to... I have to go.
[282:15.45]Ow.
[282:28.73]I think it's possible.
[282:30.15]Each mission has been about 45 minutes to an hour.
[282:33.17]Ooh.
[282:34.67]But I'm not rushing this.
[282:35.69]I genuinely really like this game a lot.
[282:37.37]So I'm not rushing to the end.
[282:39.31]If I want to, we'll stream it again.
[282:41.03]Let's do it again.
[282:42.85]And do the side missions and stuff.
[282:44.29]So don't worry.
[282:49.27]The next stream after House Flipper, I will finish Trippang.
[282:54.81]So what does the gas mask do now?
[282:58.04]This mission is pretty long.
[282:59.16]Okay.
[283:03.04]And browser games.
[283:05.38]Well, that would make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?
[283:08.60]Finish up Tripang and then do browser stuff?
[283:11.24]That makes sense to me.
[283:16.88]Yeah, House Leopard is Tuesday.
[283:25.13]We're never going to see this game again?
[283:26.55]No, no way.
[283:28.85]No way to what you said.
[283:29.99]Are you going to dress fancy?
[283:31.79]I might.
[283:33.05]This mission is really good.
[283:34.09]Nice.
[284:03.77]They've all been pretty strong so far.
[284:04.81]Sorry, I should be talking.
[284:33.25]What's going on, everybody?
[284:34.09]Welcome to Mission 5.
[284:37.07]We are ready.
[284:37.81]We're gonna get in here.
[284:38.53]We're gonna... Guns blazing.
[284:43.74]Make sure you follow the stream.
[284:53.34]Intel.
[284:53.51]Intel.
[284:55.41]Emergency alert.
[284:56.11]All personnel must don gas masks and CBRN suits immediately.
[285:01.41]Shelter in place and await further orders.
[285:03.02]If you experience auditory or visual hallucinations, disarm yourself and report to security immediately.
[285:11.33]Jesus.
[285:30.65]Bro you you watching TV There's no way you can see through that you're watching fucking like YouTube videos through that thing I'm not gonna tell on you, but like come on turn it off.
[285:49.72]Oh
[286:00.70]Rats!
[286:16.47]Does the gas mask mean I can't run for that long or is it my breathing different or something?
[286:30.10]That would make sense.
[286:35.32]Alright, who dies first?
[286:38.41]Phantom 1-1 or Phantom 1-2?
[286:39.51]Composer or Oracle?
[286:41.19]Who dies first?
[286:53.59]Me?
[286:54.45]Oh, me.
[286:55.49]Okay, let's get a vote.
[286:58.55]Is there a mod right here?
[287:00.29]Who dies first?
[287:02.79]Phantom11.
[287:03.61]This is Oracle, Composer, or me.
[287:13.06]Who dies first?
[287:15.72]That's actually going to be really hard.
[287:24.27]Bet or a pull?
[287:25.21]I think it has to be a pull, because a bet would be between two, right?
[287:28.63]Let's do a pull.
[287:32.60]Bet?
[287:34.80]Can you bet with more than... You can add more?
[287:36.90]Alright, then make it a bet.
[287:40.88]Who dies first?
[287:43.84]Between the three of us.
[287:46.39]Oracle, who is 1-1.
[287:48.51]Composer is 1-2, and then me.
[287:51.33]Well, now you got me all fucked up because now I'm going to be really concerned now.
[288:03.73]The options are Oracle, who is 1-1, Composer, who is 1-2, and then me.
[288:13.21]What if no one dies?
[288:14.27]Well, then everyone gets refunded.
[288:19.05]Yeah, they're doing it now.
[288:25.75]Is it friendly fire?
[288:27.29]Yes.
[288:28.27]I believe that's correct.
[288:37.30]Part of me kind of hopes we open this door and a grenade just kills all three of us.
[288:42.57]Then we're going to have to go frame by frame and see who exploded into guts first.
[289:04.49]People saying, like, oh, what if we can just look it up?
[289:07.71]Yeah?
[289:10.55]Do you... I'm in this too.
[289:15.10]I've died probably 40 or 50 times so far in this game.
[289:22.16]In the gameplay walkthrough, it does not say, hey, and then streamer Jerma985 walks down the hallway and gets hit in the head with an axe.
[289:35.46]Alright.
[289:38.00]Good luck.
[289:46.63]Imagine betting on fucking Oracle.
[289:50.41]Couldn't even go through the door right.
[289:51.57]I thought that just killed me for some reason.
[290:00.74]What was that?
[290:06.76]Okay, I thought he disappeared.
[290:07.79]Hey, get out of the way!
[290:11.27]Okay.
[290:38.65]31, 33, and 36%.
[290:38.97]Wow.
[290:39.23]Ow!
[290:39.29]My fucking heart attack!
[290:40.03]Flight 83 was formerly a Soviet military base.
[291:11.75]OK.
[291:14.82]Still got everybody.
[291:18.50]Oracle composer.
[291:29.90]This door is automated too.
[291:31.36]106 see if you can find a generator will keep this always secure.
[291:40.49]They're both gonna die at the exact same time.
[291:42.05]They're both gonna die off-camera.
[291:50.08]They're both gonna die off-camera.
[292:18.55]But who screams first?
[292:22.19]Who screams first?
[292:24.15]It's gonna be Composer's gonna be like And then fucking Phantom's gonna be like NO COMPOSER!
[292:38.56]Okay.
[292:39.94]One member of the security team is unaccounted for.
[292:41.80]Here we go.
[292:51.31]That guy's running faster than an F1 car.
[292:53.19]That's scary.
[293:00.67]I thought his name was Oracle.
[293:02.15]What did I say?
[293:02.67]Phantom?
[293:03.09]I don't even have their names right.
[293:08.52]Oh, yeah.
[293:09.42]Phantom.
[293:11.08]That's a pretty cool name, though.
[293:22.96]Okay.
[293:24.86]I almost just lost it for myself.
[293:29.80]Oh, they're Phantom 1.
[293:30.83]Okay, right, right.
[293:31.85]Phantom is like the name of the unit.
[293:36.09]Alright, that's what it was.
[293:43.84]I'm actually really intrigued.
[293:47.62]Who gets grabbed by the monster first?
[294:04.78]We good?
[294:05.16]Where'd they go?
[294:23.48]Uh.
[294:23.72]Can we identify them?
[294:24.34]Are they alive?
[294:25.40]We would have heard them on the radio.
[294:27.04]That's a lot of blood.
[294:55.44]Alright, get the forensics.
[294:57.36]Is this Oracle's blood here?
[294:59.18]Whose blood is this?
[295:01.28]What time did they die?
[295:08.48]I saw somebody.
[295:09.93]I saw a body on the ground.
[295:14.47]Jesus Christ!
[295:15.15]... ... ...
[295:26.13]Don't run?
[295:26.81]What do you mean, don't run?
[295:33.65]Can't kill them.
[295:39.12]So I'm hallucinating.
[295:51.55]I think.
[295:59.09]They're blind.
[296:03.71]Don't run.
[296:06.61]Move silently.
[296:07.55]Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[296:13.46]Okay.
[296:24.93]We're still physically pulling and absorbing several objects within close proximity.
[296:29.63]We're unsure where they are taken to.
[296:31.13]There are several cameras inside and they continue to transmit from a location at least a thousand miles away.
[296:36.37]Thousands of miles away.
[296:39.29]God.
[296:51.88]do what do I do what do I do what do I do what do I do what do I do it's coming down it's what do I do okay I know what to do the first you just said run that's the one thing it said to not do
[297:20.68]Oracle's going to go on the radio.
[297:22.76]I'm so glad I could see you.
[297:25.71]Phantom over there didn't make it.
[297:28.31]Or whatever.
[297:29.07]Composer.
[297:29.53]I don't know.
[297:44.94]I met the guy yesterday.
[297:45.82]I don't remember what his name is.
[297:56.46]What?
[298:03.85]This is Composer.
[298:04.51]This is Composer.
[298:05.15]I repeat, this is Composer.
[298:06.37]Taking heavy enemy fire.
[298:13.88]What the fuck did it come on?
[298:26.91]Did both of them die at once?
[298:28.17]I don't know.
[298:29.41]I don't know.
[298:35.87]We didn't even hear a scream.
[298:36.91]We didn't hear anything.
[298:37.51]Am I going the right way?
[299:03.61]Oh.
[299:09.18]Yeah, usually there's a yowl or something.
[299:11.28]Yeah, there usually is a yowl.
[299:12.66]That's true.
[299:17.02]Access attempt successful uploading.
[299:21.02]Data package.
[299:22.59]Upload complete.
[299:24.49]Incoming transmission.
[299:27.05]Bunch of swears.
[299:27.79]User identified.
[299:31.63]Subject 106.
[299:35.34]Your mission is nearing completion.
[299:37.80]Will it end on your terms or theirs?
[299:41.68]Who is sending us these things?
[299:48.32]Yeah, usually there's a... Can I move this?
[300:10.78]Um Oh, okay What oh fuck that's not good
[300:36.50]Did you say that?
[300:37.08]Hey, my last breath.
[300:38.48]Don't let him near the console.
[300:39.44]Uh-oh.
[301:09.28]Is he gonna be okay?
[301:10.03]Yeah, they're gonna be fine.
[301:23.03]I'm gonna get jumpscare grabbed by one of these.
[301:27.16]Wait, who is that?
[301:43.54]How did you not get... You know there's monsters around here.
[301:46.14]You should be using suppression things.
[301:49.12]You're going to attract the monster.
[301:51.22]You guys are attracting the monster.
[301:53.44]You're attracting the monster.
[302:13.68]You idiots!
[302:14.60]Why are you firing so... But, okay.
[302:25.23]But, are they still alive?
[302:29.17]We don't know if that was them in the room.
[302:31.21]Hold on.
[302:31.75]We need to confirm this.
[302:34.00]You died first.
[302:34.84]But we're not sure, though.
[302:37.30]We're not sure. ...
[302:47.39]How's this for strange activity?
[303:00.62]First confirmed death?
[303:02.66]No, no, no.
[303:03.06]That's not how it works.
[303:05.52]Not yet.
[303:05.86]Not yet.
[303:06.14]We need to know if they died first.
[303:26.99]OK.
[303:27.15]That's not how time works.
[303:35.40]They may have been dead from the very beginning.
[303:38.22]I think one of them was on the ground, possibly.
[303:40.67]We got to confirm it.
[303:44.21]I hear the whisperings.
[304:02.51]It's Cope.
[304:04.53]Even if it is Cope, we need to confirm it.
[304:07.47]I agree with you.
[304:08.05]It very well could be me.
[304:20.82]God.
[304:27.78]What if they're MIA forever?
[304:29.04]I don't know.
[304:31.46]Is it confirmed?
[304:38.26]I hate this.
[304:40.34]Am I even going the right way?
[304:52.84]No.
[305:01.47]This way?
[305:03.78]This room is so bright, it's hard to see.
[305:05.52]Oh, okay.
[305:06.22]What is that?
[305:07.52]Something sprinting around?
[305:35.50]If he gets to the end and those two dudes are still alive, then he died first.
[305:40.90]How are we ever gonna know?
[305:48.49]Something is sprinting around out here.
[305:50.31]Okay, it's just that.
[306:06.54]What the hell is going on?
[306:09.65]What's wrong with my bitrate?
[306:10.65]Do I have to do something here?
[306:33.53]What the fuck just happened?
[306:41.62]Okay.
[306:59.48]I'm hallucinating right now.
[307:00.60]That's what's going on.
[307:16.86]Um... Is this backrooms?
[307:29.72]Actual backrooms?
[307:40.87]Hold on.
[307:53.74]Do not enter.
[307:54.58]I'm going in.
[307:56.36]Never mind.
[308:15.44]Uh...
[308:28.82]Going in here.
[308:29.38]I thought that was a really cool Fortnite weapon.
[308:48.26]These posters again.
[309:26.64]Oh fuck you I can't go through this glass
[309:53.09]I don't like this.
[309:53.69]I think is running.
[309:58.29]Oh come on.
[310:19.86]What's that?
[310:22.52]Something's red over there.
[310:25.66]What is that thing?
[310:34.54]This actually sucks.
[310:37.60]This actually is very scary.
[310:39.22]Uh oh!
[310:45.30]Who is it?
[310:46.52]Who is it?
[310:46.92]Who is it?
[310:47.26]Do we have an ID?
[310:49.90]We have an ID?
[310:56.51]You still died first.
[311:02.05]They died after you.
[311:03.31]Hold on, we don't know that.
[311:03.99]I don't know who that is.
[311:08.93]Good.
[311:38.27]Oh, it's just a radio playing scary Halloween CDs.
[311:40.95]Come on, dude.
[311:42.73]I'm never betting channel points ever again.
[312:08.77]No, we'll pay it out.
[312:09.99]It needs to be confirmed.
[312:10.77]Alright, auto-save.
[312:24.56]Holy shit!
[312:51.19]This dude pogged his pants.
[312:57.79]Oh, what the fuck?
[312:58.65]It just knows where I am.
[313:00.67]I thought if I. Oh.
[313:08.42]Stop doing that.
[313:09.34]Oh, it's that hand again.
[313:22.65]Stop doing that!
[313:24.26]Oh yeah?
[313:57.30]Alright.
[313:59.09]Get the intel.
[314:08.09]Take a bath.
[314:18.48]Just paranoid that if I'm going to run.
[314:19.76]I've heard the sound effects this whole time.
[314:27.86]Well, very obviously.
[314:30.60]We got here.
[314:34.09]This is still fine.
[314:36.25]I like these weapons.
[314:36.83]I'm going to keep them.
[314:51.27]Find me.
[315:00.91]What the hell does that mean?
[315:03.14]Somebody just used that?
[315:29.12]When I find what do I do?
[315:31.16]Hey, where am I trying to go?
[315:54.39]This way.
[316:00.03]Don't do it.
[316:07.06]Are you crouching?
[316:09.94]No, this is the character's height.
[316:19.68]Phantom 2-1.
[316:24.03]That's Phantom 2-1.
[316:25.57]Wait.
[316:25.79]That's 2-1.
[316:27.27]I wonder if they're going to be down there.
[316:40.32]We need 12 and 11.
[316:40.94]I pressed it, right?
[316:53.73]No power or something.
[317:12.41]I do.
[317:12.65]Do you have any idea where 1, 1, and 1, 2 is?
[317:14.99]Need to confirm if they died.
[317:18.29]I had a bet.
[317:36.40]He's got the autopsy report.
[317:41.14]Uh-oh.
[317:47.63]Phantom Wait, it's not you guys
[318:21.91]If it was them, that would have been so fucking funny.
[318:31.71]That would have been unbelievably funny.
[318:34.55]I don't think there would have been another funnier clip on this channel.
[318:37.70]If I just unloaded and killed them both.
[318:44.60]Alright, now what?
[318:46.32]Drop down here?
[318:48.40]No way, right?
[318:53.70]I guess so.
[319:05.28]What was that?
[319:08.50]There was somebody in there.
[319:11.09]That was weird.
[319:31.38]Creepy.
[319:33.54]Static from the expedition team members and all camera feeds were cut.
[319:37.70]Gas alarms went off and everyone was waiting to get gas pass.
[319:41.50]Huh.
[319:50.07]Ow.
[319:57.43]Weird.
[319:57.65]Uh oh.
[319:58.27]Uh uh uh.
[320:05.09]Yeah?
[320:09.21]What can I do for you?
[320:26.08]Oh boy.
[320:32.62]Somebody's in here.
[320:37.70]Erm, what's going on here?
[320:39.18]I like the erm.
[320:51.96]It's funny.
[320:53.05]Back on your back!
[321:02.57]Moving!
[321:23.08]Alright.
[321:29.54]I just remember playing Call of Duty.
[321:31.66]Black Ops.
[321:33.45]And there would be people running around like this.
[321:36.59]And they would be playing the way that this game is actually played.
[321:40.59]In fast motion.
[321:44.07]And they would kill that many people in a room.
[321:57.73]Weird carpet.
[322:02.87]Oh, God.
[322:03.39]I'm thinking about just sprinting.
[322:18.00]That just disappeared.
[322:26.64]Stop it.
[322:27.80]What the hell was that?
[322:28.70]Did you see that?
[322:29.94]I saw it.
[322:30.30]I saw it.
[322:31.89]I saw it.
[322:32.31]I saw it.
[322:32.63]I saw it.
[322:56.90]You're right here.
[322:58.32]Found you.
[323:20.63]Hold on.
[323:21.17]Let me play Call of Duty for a second.
[323:23.47]Let me play Call of Duty for a second.
[323:25.85]Make sure I'm like lying down on the ground.
[323:32.66]Is that a hallway?
[323:34.02]Okay.
[323:34.24]Did somebody just walk in?
[323:35.64]Okay.
[323:52.45]I'm here.
[323:52.87]I'm here.
[323:53.31]Kill me.
[323:53.75]I'm here.
[323:55.85]I'm here, kill me!
[323:56.77]Oh, pretty good Arnold.
[324:05.75]At least a 3 out of 10.
[324:25.73]I like it over there.
[324:28.71]Don't, that thing keeps burping in my ear and it scares me every time.
[324:37.00]Watch my back, move it up!
[324:38.94]Alright, it's on you.
[324:45.98]We gotta sweep this fucking- Over there!
[324:50.54]Oh, I can flake all dirty.
[324:53.20]South of the flare.
[324:58.12]Oh shit, I'm out of ammo
[325:39.95]Our UAV is online.
[325:43.71]Our UAV is airborne.
[325:59.35]What's that thing that was in the sky and just went...
[326:10.51]Why would you throw that grenade over there?
[326:12.85]Explain it!
[326:13.61]Explain it to me!
[326:14.49]Explain it!
[326:14.93]Alright, we're going.
[326:36.83]You and me.
[326:39.32]If that thing shows up, I'm feeding it to you.
[326:41.06]I don't know if you're going to want to eat it though, dude.
[326:49.26]What happened?
[326:52.86]Well, get out of here then.
[326:56.74]Oh, you're not allowed to come through here.
[326:58.10]Only the main character gets to do this.
[327:08.19]You have arrived at your destination.
[327:14.02]Hit it again.
[327:14.82]We got to destroy this thing.
[327:16.30]Need one two in there.
[327:20.28]I don't see one two.
[327:37.65]Alright, what do we got?
[327:50.09]Okay.
[327:56.92]Double laser.
[328:03.34]Composer!
[328:05.84]Oh, this is a different person.
[328:07.36]One, two, uh... Cauliflower?
[328:22.99]Did I do that?
[328:26.91]Did I do that?
[328:31.62]It was quite the Steve Urkel.
[328:34.36]Uh, okay.
[328:35.02]Okay.
[328:41.58]Subject 83.
[328:41.94]Let me in!
[329:16.68]Have to sneak.
[329:39.51]Where subject 83?
[330:07.13]How did you not get hit by it?
[330:30.82]Goodbye.
[330:32.11]Wait, give me that.
[330:35.21]Subject to 83.
[330:35.59]I don't even know where... Where is it?
[330:40.09]Maybe I have to shoot this.
[330:43.43]Can I control that?
[330:44.09]I don't think so.
[330:57.42]Something's coming.
[331:12.65]What the hell is that?
[331:16.68]Are they all going to turn into monsters?
[331:20.74]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[331:21.90]I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[331:24.26]When they're doing that, I think I have to go press this stuff on the walls, right?
[331:27.94]Uh, wait, can I... I can't just do this?
[331:43.61]I think that's what I have to do.
[331:53.18]I don't know.
[332:01.37]Oh.
[332:02.57]Don't touch it.
[332:22.02]If I can get them all.
[332:30.85]There's two more here with it.
[332:32.45]Oh shit.
[332:42.95]Ooh.
[332:59.28]Die!
[333:00.06]Ooh, right in his head.
[333:09.01]Jesus.
[333:13.22]Who's still firing?
[333:37.08]Alright, I gotta turn these off.
[333:40.08]This game is chaos.
[333:41.66]It's great.
[333:49.95]What the?
[333:51.17]We're good.
[333:54.59]Did Jerma die first?
[333:55.83]Why is the bet still going?
[333:58.09]Because it needs to be confirmed.
[334:01.87]We've not confirmed it.
[334:16.47]It's 8.30.
[334:17.03]Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[334:18.53]I gotta go.
[334:20.07]But not... I can finish this.
[334:21.48]This is probably the boss.
[334:24.74]Now what?
[334:28.46]Yeah, level's almost over.
[334:29.26]I can stick around for another 20 minutes.
[334:32.02]Right here.
[334:35.10]Where is this electricity?
[334:37.88]There it is.
[334:43.81]Composer 2-1 is not our guy.
[334:51.20]Yeah, if we get to the end of the level and we can't confirm it, then we'll just refund everything.
[335:05.42]Oh, that's a lot of people in there.
[335:26.68]He's still alive.
[335:27.56]Whoa!
[335:33.13]Oh shit!
[335:34.07]In my pants!
[335:34.97]That guy has a machine gun.
[335:44.66]What did he say?
[335:47.10]Thanks a lot?
[336:12.43]Alright, any more ammo?
[336:14.39]And this should be it right here, right?
[336:19.53]I'm stuck on the stairs.
[336:26.93]Alright, there's one more.
[336:28.23]I think was the one that was up here, yeah.
[336:45.21]The last one.
[336:56.69]Oh, God damn it.
[336:58.47]I had way too much confidence running down there without any slow-mo.
[337:07.40]It's okay.
[337:08.36]It saves it right there.
[337:09.06]I think, right?
[337:31.82]Ow.
[337:35.98]Alright, get away, get away, get away, get away.
[337:40.95]That had to have killed him.
[337:53.68]Oh, quiet.
[337:55.54]You're so loud.
[337:59.75]Oh my god, you have a flamethrower of some sort.
[338:01.91]Alright, this is it.
[338:30.75]perfect sleep stream uh I'm not so sure about that but we are having fun nonetheless alright let me just get everything because this is the last wave or this might be the actual fight maybe I'm definitely gonna have to shoot it with that that's without a doubt any more ammo or anything oh whatever just don't die
[339:14.96]Alright, they come from over here.
[339:26.75]Yep.
[339:39.53]I think I did OK.
[339:58.91]OK, that looks good.
[340:03.49]So now what?
[340:06.25]There it is.
[340:06.83]Alright, turn this shit on.
[340:25.99]It's not your time to make it.
[340:35.65]Oh.
[340:49.02]I don't think we can confirm who actually died.
[340:53.64]Pay up.
[340:57.05]Somebody was lying on the ground.
[340:58.59]Right at the beginning, but I don't think we can confirm who it was.
[341:04.84]And then I died.
[341:05.58]Yeah, I think we got a refund.
[341:09.99]Send it all back.
[341:10.53]There's only one line on the ground we can't confirm.
[341:13.39]It's for fun.
[341:13.85]Cool.
[341:33.69]Yeah, just refund.
[341:35.81]It's all good.
[341:36.45]A refund?
[341:36.75]No.
[341:36.81]Yeah, refund's fine.
[342:04.42]Alright, we got one more mission to do, but it is not going to be tonight.
[342:08.35]I got to get out of here.
[342:09.59]I've got to do some stuff before it gets to be too late.
[342:13.37]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[342:18.60]Tuesday at 1 p.m.
[342:19.96]Pacific, we're doing a big House Flipper event.
[342:31.14]Somewhere between 10 and 14 or so, 11 or 12 different people, different streamers.
[342:38.41]Everyone's going to make a house at the same time.
[342:40.51]They have about an hour and 10 maybe minutes, hour and 20.
[342:46.51]I'm going to get a tour of each house individually.
[342:55.72]Then after that,
[342:58.54]I'm going to be dipping out for about four or five days.
[343:01.73]And you'll see me after Tuesday, I mean.
[343:05.91]You'll see me probably on the weekend.
[343:06.89]We'll finish this up and we'll do some browser games.

[343:14.01]Be there if you want to see the House Flipper stuff.
[343:16.23]There's going to be a lot of House Flipper streams being streamed.
[343:21.68]We're going to take the House Flipper category probably as high as possible.
[343:26.60]The highest...
[343:29.65]I'm going to try to get it as high as it's ever been.
[343:35.43]We'll do the sunflowers on Tuesday as well.
[343:37.58]Well.
[343:37.80]Alright.
