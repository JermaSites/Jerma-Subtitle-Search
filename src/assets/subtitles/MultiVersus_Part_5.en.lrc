[ve:60.16.100]

[00:05.75]Alright, I'm almost back.
[00:06.33]I just got to get my controller and we can get started.
[00:08.51]Give me one more sec.
[00:55.06]Somebody just said Gremlins 2 sucks, Jermo.
[00:58.70]Excuse me?
[01:03.46]You can't say that here.
[01:09.78]You can't say that here.
[01:12.08]That's a banned sentence.
[01:19.60]Alright, let's keep going.
[01:22.28]So, again, thank you Warner Brothers for sponsoring this stream.
[01:26.12]Season 1 is underway for multiverses.
[01:29.44]Morty is in the game, which we haven't seen yet.
[01:32.28]Gizmo's in the game.
[01:35.38]I'm excited!
[01:41.81]Mod that guy?
[01:42.49]Why would I mod that guy?
[01:46.24]Oh my god.
[01:47.32]Wait, wait, wait.
[01:47.74]Hold on.
[01:48.04]You need a live reaction.
[01:52.52]You need a live reaction.
[02:01.90]Come on.
[02:02.40]You gotta give a live reaction to this.
[02:05.19]I've been waiting like a hundred years for this.
[02:16.56]Gizmo from Gremlins and Gremlins 2.
[02:28.12]No, this is really cool.
[02:36.19]It's not supposed to be that big.
[02:40.98]So how does he play?
[02:42.61]Is he good?
[02:44.19]You guys have had access to this for like the last few hours.
[02:47.69]Is Gizmo good?
[02:48.19]Alright, hold on.
[02:51.39]We gotta go to the lab.
[02:53.45]Yeah, this is part of Season 1.
[02:58.59]Yeah, this is Morty.
[02:59.29]I haven't even unlocked Morty.
[03:03.49]So I play this on Xbox.
[03:05.95]So I have two accounts.
[03:11.43]Is the timer going in the chat?
[03:12.63]Can you guys tell me?
[03:15.69]You got to do the voice?
[03:19.49]I'm not doing the voice.
[03:20.05]Should I even unlock Morty?
[03:21.14]I mean, I kind of should, right?
[03:23.48]Okay, let's unlock.
[03:25.92]Let's get everybody unlocked.
[03:27.54]And I want to take these people into the lab.
[03:31.78]There's cross progression.
[03:33.08]I'm so glad you brought that up because you're absolutely right.
[03:35.30]There's cross progression across the whole platform.
[03:38.36]So PC, Xbox, doesn't matter where you are.
[03:44.35]It's free.
[03:52.07]Do I even have the battle pass?
[03:55.83]What do I see there?
[03:56.31]Oh, hey, I think I do, don't I?
[03:57.46]What's this?
[04:00.76]Toon Squad 96.
[04:01.42]Unlock premium.
[04:05.96]Do I don't have the battle pass?
[04:07.88]Oh, I could probably just get it.
[04:10.30]Let's see what we get.
[04:11.70]So this is the Premium Battle Pass.
[04:13.10]You know what my favorite thing about this game is?
[04:15.56]This stuff.
[04:18.03]The ring out stuff.
[04:18.95]When you knock somebody out and you get to see the cool animation.
[04:22.99]I can't wait until there's a thousand of these.
[04:27.89]What do you get at the very end?
[04:31.58]Well, that's absolutely worth it.
[04:35.78]Okay.
[04:36.40]Well, I have to be grinding for that one.
[04:38.56]I'm going to spend some time playing.
[04:41.41]Alright, let's go to the lab.
[04:47.02]I'm so happy to do this.
[04:48.82]No, get Taz out of here.
[04:49.96]I don't want to play with Taz.
[04:53.10]Gizmo.
[05:01.50]Okay, so he's not tiny.
[05:02.82]He's not tiny.
[05:08.94]I got an arrow?
[05:10.22]Okay, what's the standard combo?
[05:13.88]That seems pretty amazing.
[05:18.97]Is it just those three?
[05:19.87]Can I charge any of it?
[05:20.63]No.
[05:21.59]They changed the hitbox, apparently, in this update.
[05:27.29]You can travel really far with that.
[05:28.21]Alright, so what about the standard?
[05:32.62]Pretty cool.
[05:34.14]Just like from the goddamn movie!
[05:39.69]I don't care.
[05:40.11]I'll spend all day playing to get better.
[05:42.99]This is definitely a moment where I'm going to play as hard as I can.
[05:47.15]Alright, so let me... Hold on.
[05:49.01]So that's... Okay, that's the air too.
[05:53.70]And it arcs.
[05:55.06]Oh yeah, that's fucking awesome.
[05:56.02]Alright, so that's on cooldown now.
[05:58.76]Oh my god, it's just like the movie.
[06:00.78]Alright, so what about down?
[06:06.71]What?! !
[06:10.25]The popcorn.
[06:11.15]See, yeah, this is my BatChest moment, guys.
[06:14.73]I'm sorry, it really is.
[06:16.47]This is my BatChest moment.
[06:18.81]I get to have this.
[06:20.39]What do they do?
[06:21.31]They linger?
[06:27.24]That seems amazing.
[06:28.04]Alright, you can do popcorn.
[06:33.48]Okay, cool.
[06:37.00]So what about specials?
[06:41.28]He sings and dances.
[06:42.08]Okay, that's perfect.
[06:42.92]What does that do?
[06:46.73]I think because he's a support, right?
[06:50.67]Let's do all that stuff.
[06:52.11]That's crazy.
[06:55.41]He doesn't have a smash move.
[06:56.39]He doesn't have like a power.
[06:58.25]I guess that could be it, but I don't think it has knockout power.
[07:02.44]Find out.
[07:02.74]Alright, so that's sing and dance.
[07:04.22]We can look it up.
[07:06.82]You go into the box?
[07:08.02]What?
[07:13.34]Alright.
[07:15.26]So that turns into that.
[07:17.30]Is it defense?
[07:19.54]Arrow popcorn?
[07:24.12]Okay.
[07:24.98]Okay.
[07:25.56]Alright.
[07:26.16]Alright.
[07:26.50]Hold on.
[07:28.89]Yeah.
[07:30.59]Oh, I feel it.
[07:35.19]So you really want to get that out there and they're just like, don't die in the lab.
[07:39.11]That'll be embarrassing.
[07:44.46]Okay, that's actually pretty cool.
[07:46.38]Now, what about, uh... Top special is sort of just a little jump.
[07:52.72]Which, that seems kind of dangerous.
[07:53.98]Because it's not very far.
[07:56.42]Alright.
[07:59.90]The music is really loud.
[08:01.06]Alright, I'll turn it down.
[08:07.20]You can drive the little car.
[08:09.58]Are you... fucking kidding me?
[08:21.75]Yeah.
[08:25.29]You can't swear.
[08:26.05]What?
[08:27.14]No, I'm fine.
[08:29.92]Jerma, you are Clamp.
[08:33.14]Uh, there is a deepfake with me as Mr. Clamp, if you've never seen it before.
[08:40.24]It's actually pretty funny.
[08:41.34]That's better, okay.
[08:47.43]So you really- Ooh, the umbrella?
[08:49.45]What is that?
[08:55.99]OK, you can float around.
[08:58.43]Alright, so down special was that I gotta let's do some reading.
[09:14.56]Oh yeah.
[09:29.93]So I wonder what the singing does.
[09:31.33]Alright, let's do some reading.
[09:35.41]Where is it?
[09:35.97]You can read.
[09:36.85]Oh, move list.
[09:37.55]Here we go.
[09:37.83]Alright.
[09:42.39]Some of Gizmo's attacks apply a music buff.
[09:44.58]Affected enemies are silenced if they reach the max stack count, stopping them from using cooldown abilities.
[09:49.12]Affected abilities will create a musical note.
[09:52.06]Rhythm allows the bard to play magical tunes when they evade.
[09:56.48]Hitting overlapping enemies.
[09:57.78]Okay.
[09:57.90]Okay.
[10:00.75]Popcorn.
[10:01.33]It can be ignited.
[10:02.27]We know that.
[10:04.49]Gizmo charges before slamming a keyboard, dealing armor break.
[10:07.29]Alright.
[10:08.41]What does that get in the box one?
[10:10.69]This one here.
[10:12.11]Gizmo hops on a toy chest which blocks projectiles.
[10:14.63]Hold input to stay in the chest.
[10:17.47]While attached to an ally, he will hold out an umbrella for a similar effect on his ally.
[10:21.49]Alright.
[10:23.71]Okay.
[10:26.03]Alright, let's fucking go.
[10:26.83]I'm ready.
[10:28.07]Let's give it a try.
[10:32.38]Who wants to queue up and get your ass kicked?
[10:43.91]Oh, right.
[10:45.85]That was LeBron.
[10:50.20]Dude, you're a bozo.
[11:00.69]You should play as Morty.
[11:01.66]I don't know really how to play as Morty.
[11:04.84]This is Gizmo only for a little while.
[11:06.68]Just for a little while.
[11:14.76]When is Stripe?
[11:15.32]Yeah, apparently Stripe's going to be in the game too.
[11:23.59]Oh, right.
[11:23.85]I don't have the skin.
[11:24.73]Oh, well.
[11:24.99]It's fine.
[11:26.89]You have to do the Gizmo voice while you play.
[11:29.73]Okay.
[11:29.85]Okay.
[11:33.31]Hold on, there's a way to do it.
[11:34.45]It's kind of like this, right?
[11:39.14]Is it you?
[11:41.28]I'll get in here.
[11:41.66]I don't have any perks.
[11:47.16]Alright, let's see if I can do this.
[11:48.14]A 1v1 with Gizmo is probably a bad idea, but whatever.
[11:50.84]I'm going to get beat up for a little while.
[11:55.77]Show them what we got.
[11:57.49]That's Stitch.
[12:00.21]Don't they have...
[12:04.90]That's Otto.
[12:08.10]Ismo's supposed to be support.
[12:09.12]He seems like really actually pretty fun to play.
[12:12.33]As a solo character too.
[12:13.43]Alright, let's go.
[12:15.19]I've been waiting 20- Oh, and I gotta tweet!
[12:16.99]I have to tweet this!
[12:18.06]I'll tweet it after.
[12:18.82]I'll tweet it.
[12:41.50]Ooh, don't touch those musical notes!
[12:42.88]You can shoot it up!
[13:07.91]That combo, get the combo, get the combo going!
[13:17.21]Just run over with the car!
[13:21.23]Whoa, that was a good combo.
[13:39.71]I gotta charge that more often.
[14:21.50]That stomp is awesome, too.
[14:22.72]This one here has a lot of priority, it feels like.
[14:36.82]Alright, that's good.
[14:37.48]Good warm-up.
[14:37.92]That's good.
[14:38.72]Good, good, good, good, good.
[14:40.02]Where's my phone?
[14:41.98]I gotta tweet.
[14:43.04]I forgot to do the tweet.
[14:45.79]He's fun to play.
[14:46.59]Yes.
[14:59.03]Oh, I forgot this is what the tweet I was going to do was.
[15:01.66]Oh, that's fine.
[15:02.64]Yeah, that's fine.
[15:04.10]Is that a good one?
[15:04.72]I said I was going to be crying.
[15:07.59]Oh, no, I did that joke.
[15:08.45]It's fine.
[15:12.49]Alright, I got to get used to the moveset.
[15:15.84]Wait, no, I just tweeted.
[15:16.56]Hold on.
[15:28.00]I mean, look at him.
[15:34.39]Oh!
[15:36.55]He's so... He's perfect.
[15:44.03]He's actually perfect.
[15:47.15]It's one of my actually favorite movies ever.
[15:59.90]I'm so happy to see him in the game.
[16:03.08]For the longest time, I never thought they were going to do anything with gremlins ever again.
[16:23.72]They're making a third movie.
[16:24.76]I don't know what they're doing.
[16:25.48]Aren't they doing an animated thing?
[16:32.20]Oh, versus a bugs.
[16:35.24]It's my old best friend.
[16:36.60]I better be careful.
[16:47.21]Why are you so weird?
[16:48.19]I don't know.
[16:50.91]Blame this movie.
[16:55.39]I wish that was a joke.
[17:07.40]Alright, so it's down.
[17:10.04]Down special is the really only knockout potential that he has.
[17:22.68]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[17:24.00]Oh, he doesn't know.
[17:24.58]He doesn't know.
[17:24.96]He doesn't know.
[17:25.42]I screwed that up.
[17:27.48]Sorry.
[17:54.76]Oh, I can drive that car?
[17:57.84]What are you doing?
[18:12.83]Give me that sandwich!
[18:32.10]Ooh.
[18:32.54]It's the Wade actor.
[18:35.38]No, it's not.
[18:36.16]I just looked over and saw that.
[19:07.81]You're fucking with me now.
[19:21.39]So how did the hitboxes change?
[19:44.50]Excuse me.
[19:44.90]Don't like the camera.
[19:56.90]Why not?
[19:57.28]I told you we got this.
[20:01.78]What's my favorite type of pizza?
[20:03.40]Standard pepperoni thin crust.
[20:07.72]Continue.
[20:11.96]And it's got to be crunchy.
[20:12.74]It's going to be crispy on the bottom.
[20:14.55]I want it to be crispy and crunchy on the bottom.
[20:16.75]And it better be.
[20:17.47]Or I'm going to be pissed.
[20:19.39]What happened?
[20:20.65]Wait, what's going on?
[20:26.95]So, yeah, the hitbox is different.
[20:28.39]So, it's now tied to their actual animations.
[20:33.66]Before, it was kind of a little square or oval around them.
[20:39.91]The hitboxes, I think, have shrunk a little.
[20:42.13]Interesting.
[20:42.59]Alright.
[20:43.09]Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
[20:45.52]I can't really notice.
[20:46.20]Feels pretty good so far.
[20:50.30]I think it's pretty good.
[20:50.90]I had a dream that you went to my university graduation and drank my grandmother's ashes in a milkshake before I was meant to go on stage.
[21:07.73]It was awkward.
[21:10.19]Stop fucking eating after midnight.
[21:13.90]You know what happens.
[21:14.64]Come on.
[21:28.27]What?
[21:28.45]I was in the stands?
[21:29.35]I was in the audience?
[21:32.19]Where did I get it?
[21:33.12]Why would I have that?
[21:51.16]Wrong way.
[21:57.15]I'm used to the way that bugs plays.
[21:58.91]I gotta get used to gizmo.
[22:00.41]I love it though.
[22:01.41]He's great.
[22:27.54]You gotta feel that up way earlier.
[22:28.98]It's a great move though.
[23:09.06]Does this thing even hurt anybody?
[23:18.52]I feel like it doesn't.
[23:46.76]Oops!
[23:52.64]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[23:57.63]Why is the gremlin so big?
[23:59.13]Well... How come you play like you're orchestrating a band?
[24:04.57]What, because I move around a lot?
[24:09.62]You look like you like to suck lemons.
[24:15.35]Who are you?
[24:16.29]What are you doing here?
[24:17.11]Why are you being so mean to me?
[24:23.38]Let me go read something.
[24:24.44]Hold on.
[24:25.34]Should I try Morty?
[24:26.94]No.
[24:27.14]A few more games of Gizmo.
[24:34.90]If I play with Morty... Should I do the voice?
[24:40.50]I want to read this.
[24:42.92]I'm trying to find an opportunity, at least in solo, to do that.
[24:47.40]Oh.
[24:51.25]Can't read it.
[24:54.97]This camera angle.
[24:55.75]If you were here in the beginning of the stream... Uh-oh.
[24:58.11]Alright.
[24:58.39]Definitely want that.
[25:06.68]And that's good just to have.
[25:13.94]I'll do some teams too, because I think you can shoot the arrow at a teammate.
[25:18.00]Show them what we got.
[26:03.26]Ooh, I keep forgetting about the car!
[26:06.50]Get out of there!
[26:12.91]Get out of the car!
[26:21.80]Stop it!
[26:23.64]Stop!
[26:24.56]Where's my car?
[26:54.84]You want, wait, you wanna go for it?
[26:57.21]No, no, no, hey, hey, hey, hey, wait, wait, wait, get your car.
[27:00.33]You wanna go for it?
[27:00.95]Hey, I want, whatever.
[27:31.67]Don't shoot me.
[27:32.25]Don't.
[27:38.37]Woo.
[27:40.60]Yeah.
[27:46.76]One for blue.
[28:04.23]Look at that car.
[28:38.85]I'm off to write a 3,000 word essay about how much I don't like you.
[28:46.20]Don't.
[28:49.32]Do you see how happy I've been with this?
[28:57.44]Gizmo is in the game, man.
[29:01.89]You're doing CBD water.
[29:03.53]Oh my goodness, I forgot this was there the whole round.
[29:06.19]That's so stupid.
[29:13.86]CBD water in your eyes.
[29:31.20]The point is to get Gizmo leveled up as fast as possible to get his ultimate perk.
[29:40.54]Wait, that looks wrong.
[29:45.40]Yeah, the reason why I changed the angle of the camera is because it used to shake because the monitor that it was sitting on would always move whenever I moved.
[29:53.72]It was really annoying.
[29:55.30]It looks fucked up.
[29:58.40]Well, I'll fix it next time.
[30:45.64]What the hell just happened?
[30:46.48]That was weird.
[30:55.73]Good combo.
[30:56.39]Good combo.
[31:02.09]Water in my eyes!
[31:38.80]I need my arrows.
[31:47.22]That's a good finisher.
[32:02.87]That's a good finisher.
[32:07.64]That butt slam is amazing if you can get it.
[32:09.42]That was a good game though.
[32:20.76]Do a different facecam?
[32:21.58]Hold on, I can do this, right?
[32:22.86]Fine, I'll do the funny thing for everybody.
[32:37.04]It really does look like someone's coming out of that door with piano wire.
[32:41.16]They're going to come out of that door with piano wire and I'm going to get hit manned on stream.
[32:46.05]That's what that is.
[32:47.89]Oh yeah, I wonder what's going to happen in that door.
[32:49.69]A full monster costumed person's coming out of there.
[33:15.08]Here comes the heat.
[33:18.38]Something looks so strange about that too.
[33:20.65]Looks wrong.
[33:25.15]Monsters Inc door.
[33:34.11]Oh, Morty.
[33:37.41]What does Morty do?
[33:42.05]That's a lie.
[33:42.59]I know what Morty does.
[33:56.74]Make it bigger?
[34:02.00]What a PNG of an iPhone around the camera.
[34:09.09]Why?
[34:09.39]Alright, first let me just... Let me do some...
[34:32.60]What are you up to?
[34:33.24]Alright, we're playing.
[34:33.78]Alright, let's go.
[34:34.24]Alright, let's get a vacuum cleaner.
[34:52.06]How did you dodge the car?
[34:54.86]Alright, I got to be quiet.
[34:59.96]I gotta shut up.
[35:02.79]I wasn't in the game.
[35:03.39]I was too busy thinking about the fucking facecam.
[36:41.24]200% almost!
[36:42.26]What the hell?
[36:53.79]Morty!
[36:54.91]I mean, come on, Morty.
[37:23.60]One for blue.
[38:06.27]Oh!
[38:38.87]oh what a match oh that was close oh I thought I had it on those uh down uh damn it on the left side oh that's close play again uh yeah sure okay alright I'm back here comes the heat
[39:11.96]Morty's got a lot of projectiles, huh?
[39:19.24]Okay, that's better.
[39:22.10]That was so close, too.
[39:23.35]Do you see on the left side?
[39:24.25]I did the down, boom, boom.
[39:25.85]He recovered.
[39:26.47]Down, boom, boom.
[39:27.35]Recovered again.
[39:27.83]I just couldn't follow up.
[39:29.69]That was a good match, though.
[39:33.65]He's most fun.
[39:47.32]Who's my favorite gremlin?
[39:48.80]That would be... I think the name of the gremlin is actually Daffy.
[39:54.84]Daffy was my favorite gremlin.
[40:02.07]Morty is a mage.
[40:04.05]More of a mage than a bruiser.
[40:11.57]No, not Daffy Duck.
[40:12.75]Alright, hold on.
[40:13.31]I gotta be quiet.
[40:14.17]I gotta be gamer time.
[40:26.97]Wrong way.
[41:06.55]Oh!
[41:08.13]Oh yeah!
[41:19.51]Oh, it's alright, it's alright.
[41:30.60]Ready?
[41:30.76]Three, two, one, up!
[41:58.17]Okay, 12, 12, 12, 12.
[42:12.15]What the fuck?
[42:12.89]I teleported!
[42:15.31]No!
[42:15.65]Why do I keep facing the wrong way?
[42:16.99]New controller.
[42:49.53]It sounds like a chicken.
[42:51.04]I thought that was a chicken sound.
[43:32.18]Went right over his head.
[43:54.69]Come on, that fucking launch power!
[44:03.61]Close.
[44:04.07]Good one.
[44:04.37]Good one.
[44:04.67]Good fight.
[44:05.01]Good fight.
[44:05.31]Good fight.
[44:11.91]That was a close one.
[44:15.55]I mean, we kind of have to do it.
[44:16.43]There's a best out of three here.
[44:17.27]We got to do it again.
[44:25.73]Hold on.
[44:25.99]Wait.
[44:26.11]We have to follow up.
[44:27.81]No, no, no.
[44:28.31]Like you were shaking my grandmother's ashes in a protein shake.
[44:31.91]And when the dean called out my name and was meant to shake my hand, you ran past me and drank the frothy milkshake.
[44:37.53]What's wrong with you?
[44:47.80]Wait, did I miss the opportunity?
[44:48.86]Oh, shit.
[44:49.58]That's alright.
[44:50.02]We'll stick with the tie.
[44:54.18]I thought I hit rematch, didn't I?
[44:55.50]I guess I didn't.
[44:57.44]Alright, let's do some... Let's do some team stuff.
[45:05.95]I want to check the gizmo team stuff.
[45:12.39]Teams and... Free-for-all, maybe?
[45:18.33]Because I'm curious.
[45:20.55]I think you can shoot the arrow at your teammate.
[45:24.48]Oh, they didn't rematch.
[45:25.42]Oh, that's alright.
[45:31.43]Go to the end of the options and increase the dead zone on your controller.
[45:36.79]Yeah.
[45:43.75]How do I do that?
[45:44.61]Oh, wait.
[45:45.29]Horizontal dead zone.
[45:47.15]So, yeah, I keep not wanting to be facing that direction.
[45:51.01]What should I put this at?
[45:59.27]Higher or lower?
[46:05.93]40%?
[46:06.03]What about vertical?
[46:11.24]Should these both be the same?
[46:19.24]You should lower it if you feel like you're not getting an input red.
[46:22.17]It's mainly when I hit left.
[46:24.27]So I try to turn, and then by the time I turn left and want to let go to do the neutral arrow move, he's still facing right.
[46:37.01]Do you know if we're gonna get the sexy gremlin as a skin?
[46:38.89]I have no idea.
[46:42.61]So it should be higher or lower then?
[46:43.87]Make it smaller then?
[46:45.59]I'll try 20.
[46:45.95]See if 20 does it.
[47:02.08]Use the second stick for reverse moves?
[47:04.66]Um... Not with Gizmo.
[47:07.88]Because Gizmo's standard attack is the bow.
[47:13.78]So I can't use right stick to aim it.
[47:16.06]It has to be standard attack.
[47:17.27]Two Gizmos.
[47:17.95]This is going to be interesting.
[47:18.81]Alright, let's go.
[47:21.95]Let's do it.
[47:35.07]How come you're not eating any carrots?
[47:37.07]Because I'm not playing as Bugs.
[47:41.02]Hey, Bugs is old news to me right now.
[47:43.92]Second Daffy gets put into the game, you know it.
[47:45.60]Alright, let's see what we can do.
[47:52.90]This is two gizmos.
[48:10.49]Just get in the car.
[48:13.98]I think they nerfed Jake a lot too, by the way.
[48:15.86]From what I saw on the patch notes.
[48:17.76]He got pretty much every move got nerfed.
[48:21.76]We can drive each other's cars, I think, too.
[48:43.68]Ooh, I thought you were gonna jump.
[49:11.24]Oh, I could get a double here so cleanly if I could just do it.
[49:18.18]Let's try that again.
[49:24.76]Ooh, that does not have priority anymore, does it?
[49:28.60]Was that part of the nerve?
[49:30.16]Shit.
[49:39.49]Alright, we got to get this chick out of here.
[49:51.18]Oh shit!
[50:06.14]We gotta get rid of this Jake!
[50:12.62]What's that?
[50:25.30]That was huge.
[50:32.17]Nah, that dead zone.
[50:33.19]I gotta change it.
[51:13.12]Ah, we just can't launch anybody.
[51:18.04]We just could not get that Garnet out of here.
[51:29.01]Play again?
[51:36.11]Your dead zone should be higher, 40 to 60.
[51:38.57]Yeah, I always have the problem where I'm trying to turn the other way, and then do the standard attack move, and I just am not turning.
[51:47.47]Let me try that.
[51:48.89]Is it like 60?
[51:53.70]That's cool that you can actually do this in the game, though.
[51:56.74]So it needs to be higher, you're saying, like that.
[52:01.86]If you're not turning, lower the dead zone.
[52:03.74]Do 60-30.
[52:05.12]Try 60-30.
[52:05.88]Try it.
[52:11.51]Oh my god, I want it.
[52:17.11]Then you wipe, decrease it.
[52:21.51]Okay.
[52:27.23]LeBron is bugged?
[52:28.43]Really?
[52:36.64]I want it.
[52:44.57]Are you a fan of American EDM?
[52:47.67]I don't really listen to that much music.
[52:49.11]So, I mean, I like a lot of stuff, but I don't really listen to a lot.
[53:04.27]Hey, my sister just ate the last Swiss roll.
[53:06.77]Wait, wait, you have the screen muted.
[53:08.27]You can't even hear me.
[53:14.73]I have the rhythm.
[53:38.35]Oh, that was laggy.
[53:39.03]Getting my ass kicked here.
[53:46.05]What?
[54:10.28]Holy shit, I went flying.
[54:11.44]Take this, you ding-dongs!
[54:40.45]Oh my God, get down there.
[54:42.13]You know, my biggest problem with teams is I just it's hard.
[55:00.00]I don't know who to pay attention.
[55:00.96]I don't know who to pay.
[55:02.30]You know what I'm saying?
[55:02.92]Porky fucking pig will be in the game at some point.
[55:24.79]No, my fault Holy shit
[56:02.09]Oh, shit.
[56:02.69]He's on McDonald's Wi-Fi?
[56:07.55]No, I'm not.
[56:08.15]I want to do more 1v1s.
[56:09.41]That's where I've shined.
[56:35.84]Here comes the heat.
[56:36.92]We demand Gizmo.
[56:38.44]Okay, let's go back to Gizmo.
[56:44.40]The team-based stuff is awesome in this game.
[56:46.54]It's just I need to know when to do what.
[56:49.76]That's my problem.
[56:53.40]Everybody has these awesome kind of co-op moves.
[56:58.62]Just trying to be like, oh, do I do it now?
[57:00.58]It comes with game knowledge.
[57:09.83]Show them what we got.
[57:10.63]I've seen some insane duo stuff though.
[57:18.76]Skill issue.
[57:19.34]Oh yeah, that is one I am admitting to you right now.
[57:29.02]I look like I made it a nail polish remover.
[57:30.64]Yeah.
[58:23.00]Oh, a million percent.
[58:23.98]That's so much better.
[58:26.49]Thank you, Advice Andy.
[59:05.83]Alright, I'm getting fucking dunked on in this second round here.
[59:56.03]Let's go.
[59:56.27]Let's go.
[59:56.53]We both went like this.
[60:01.18]And then I just freaked out and died.
[60:23.00]By the way, this stream is sponsored by Warner Brothers.
[60:25.26]Thank you, Warner Brothers.
[60:26.88]Season 1 of Multiverses is underway.
[60:32.13]Gizmo, Morty have both been added.
[60:36.55]Cross-prog... They're over here.
[60:38.69]Cross-progression, by the way.
[60:42.44]PC.
[60:45.22]PlayStation.
[60:46.82]Can you guess the other one?
[60:57.40]Oh, no, I hate fighting Jakes.
[61:12.88]I think they're actually going to add ranked at some point here, too.
[61:20.59]Out of frame Andy.
[61:21.43]Uh-oh.
[61:22.95]Oh!
[61:24.63]Steven Universe!
[61:27.76]It's time to get crazy, Paris.
[62:02.76]Tell me that.
[62:03.16]Careful!
[62:04.20]This cookie coming up!
[62:32.71]Who went down?
[62:33.39]I don't know.
[62:35.52]What the fuck happened?
[62:36.32]What?
[62:38.78]I traded places with him.
[62:42.58]That was so good.
[62:43.40]Take this, you ding dong.
[62:59.48]Oh, now I'm going to get fucking diarrhea on.
[63:34.96]One for blue.
[64:05.63]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[64:15.33]Oh, come on.
[64:29.16]Shake it off.
[64:30.18]We only get stuck.
[64:33.52]I completely forgot that the arrows had cooled down, and then I freaked out, and then I just stopped playing.
[64:39.24]See, dude?
[64:39.98]Just gotta keep punching until there's no one left to punch.
[64:45.26]Here comes the heat.
[64:51.03]This has all been warm-up until now.
[64:52.41]This has all been warm-up until right now.
[65:08.50]Can you please read a book on stream?
[65:14.17]Which one?
[65:14.47]Do you have a favorite book?
[65:18.21]Somebody said, will they take the sponsorship away if you keep losing?
[65:28.88]No, that's not how it works.
[65:34.19]Hey, I am way above 500 right now.
[65:36.91]I've only lost like three times.
[65:38.13]I'm not losing this one.
[66:08.69]Boots of speed!
[66:59.45]You dodged that one?
[67:43.77]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[68:37.69]I have no idea what happened there.
[68:50.15]I think lagged out maybe?
[69:03.32]You're cheating?
[69:05.87]I didn't do anything.
[69:12.85]Okay, the season pass.
[69:13.71]I feel like I should have it.
[69:15.47]I feel like I should just get it.
[69:26.96]Can you do a sleep stream?
[69:27.88]Nah.
[69:28.06]Is there any... Hold on.
[69:39.90]Gizmo's air down special can bounce off his popcorn and his toy car to detonate them instantly.
[69:47.38]Wait, what?
[69:51.63]So that's the butt drop.
[69:55.55]So I can butt drop my car and blow them up.
[69:57.79]That's pretty cool.
[69:59.65]Okay.
[70:06.86]So you can be attached to someone.
[70:12.69]I haven't been using the music at all.
[70:14.62]I don't even know what it does.
[70:15.98]I've just been kind of just trying to get people.
[70:21.92]I want that.
[70:28.49]Cool.
[70:29.51]What about, um... Is there any Gremlins, uh... Where is it?
[70:39.94]Yeah, are there any new Gremlins ringouts or anything?
[70:50.87]Cannonball.
[70:54.19]Cool.
[71:00.97]Bossamer.
[71:01.45]Cool.
[71:03.08]Green Lantern.
[71:03.90]Is there any Gremlin stuff?
[71:11.98]Nope.
[71:20.33]Alright, no gremlin ringouts.
[71:21.81]What about banners?
[71:22.43]I think the only one is the gizmo one, right?
[71:30.81]Please read that popcorn book.
[71:39.13]I want the gizmo one.
[71:39.91]Alright, what about announcer?
[71:40.99]Is there a gizmo announcer?
[71:44.57]Let's go.
[71:47.13]Do I have enough to buy this?
[71:52.45]I can get it.
[71:54.63]Alright, I got the skin.
[72:01.03]Nice.
[72:11.38]I'll do another team fight and we're going to do team fight.
[72:13.12]Who got the most changes?
[72:20.24]It looks like bugs got changed a lot too.
[72:23.56]This patch is as of, what, today?
[72:25.24]Yesterday?
[72:36.09]Dude, this guy brought combat gear.
[72:38.21]Yeah.
[72:39.43]I'm trying a little too hard here.
[72:45.31]You should read Moby Dick.
[72:46.63]I'm studying it.
[72:51.87]Would you guys actually watch a Moby Dick stream?
[72:53.76]I feel like people wouldn't.
[72:57.16]Isn't it long though?
[72:58.14]I don't really want to read that.
[72:59.62]I don't want to read the whole book on stream.
[73:48.15]Oh, it didn't hit.
[73:58.86]That's not Gizmo talking.
[74:00.24]That was weird.
[75:03.34]Ooh, you got me with it.
[75:04.36]Nice shot.
[75:06.98]Ooh, whoop!
[75:31.74]Oh, his car had better priority than my car?
[75:42.12]Oh, you mean for Halloween?
[75:45.16]Gizmo.
[75:54.43]That was a good bench.
[75:59.33]I almost got caught like three or four times.
[76:05.39]That could have gone either way.
[76:06.17]I keep getting cut off.
[76:10.13]Oh, it's because I'm an idiot.
[76:13.47]There.
[76:17.99]You guys want to see anybody else?
[76:18.85]Didn't Superman get a bunch of changes too?
[76:35.79]Side profile, Andy.
[76:37.51]Alright.
[76:38.55]I'm going to move you from there to here.
[76:42.61]I got to find a way to get you over there, though.
[76:46.78]I just did.
[76:48.02]You're not shaking anymore, which is so much better.
[77:02.33]The announcer?
[77:02.85]I got a different announcer.
[77:04.55]Taz.
[77:46.19]Oh, crap.
[77:49.81]We're just playing bumper cars at this point.
[77:55.40]Why is the car still here?
[78:51.57]Ooh, he charged!
[79:09.08]Good fight, good fight, good fight, good fight.
[79:14.15]Gizmo is so fun.
[79:16.81]Gizmo is so fun.
[79:23.11]Not too complicated either.
[79:24.31]Just really, really clean moveset.
[79:25.89]I love it.
[79:34.73]Oh, I'm almost at that.
[79:35.37]Okay, I want to get to that car.
[79:46.84]They added Austin Powers.
[79:48.12]Would you play with him for a whole stream?
[79:49.90]Yeah.
[79:56.99]I'm going to buy a new announcer.
[79:58.07]I'll get a new announcer.
[79:58.69]I think I have enough currency left though.
[80:12.80]Start time.
[80:14.42]You can play 20 Minutes Till Dawn.
[80:17.14]I actually really do want to return to that.
[80:20.02]That game was a blast.
[80:30.25]Alright, let's go.
[80:31.14]I've been on a pretty good streak here.
[81:21.70]Holy shit, we couldn't even hit each other.
[81:23.03]That was kind of wild, actually.
[81:54.03]This is gonna be interesting!
[81:55.21]Okay!
[81:55.45]Okay, let's go!
[83:17.79]That's gonna be close!
[83:34.48]No, our cars!
[83:58.95]That was close.
[84:00.83]Good game.
[84:01.43]Damn.
[84:08.55]Let's go again.
[84:13.78]The announcer's tabs.
[84:18.52]Yeah, I wonder how many people are not believing.
[84:26.33]What's the record this stream?
[84:27.31]It's gotta be...
[84:29.18]It's got to be at least 70% win streak or win rate.
[84:34.18]Right?
[84:39.56]Although I might hit gamer fatigue at some point here soon.
[84:42.48]I'm not sure.
[84:45.27]It could happen at any moment.
[84:46.63]I just don't know when.
[84:48.81]I can check?
[84:49.41]Oh, okay.
[84:49.93]I'll do it after this.
[84:54.83]Start time!
[85:11.60]New gamer award.
[85:12.51]Alright, let's go, bro.
[85:41.16]Oh, nice.
[85:44.26]Okay, alright.
[86:16.83]Woo!
[86:18.89]Shit!
[86:19.57]Oh that was fucking sick!
[87:11.25]Blow point!
[87:12.12]Blow point!
[87:50.37]Oh, got tripped up.
[87:51.49]Oh, that was close.
[87:52.37]Holy shit.
[87:53.75]Oh, got tripped up on the left side.
[87:56.44]That was close.
[87:57.40]That was close.
[88:04.74]That was really, really... Oh, that's unfortunate.
[88:11.32]I was trying to... I don't know if when he looked over and he saw the car.
[88:15.06]Because I was trying to drop the car on him.
[88:18.08]Because when he was recovering, the car was going to hit him right in the head.
[88:21.52]And just take him out.
[88:22.76]Maybe he tried to avoid the car?
[88:24.16]I don't know.
[88:35.65]What's up with the LAN tournament camera angle?
[88:38.49]Come on, pick character!
[88:41.33]No, that's not accurate.
[88:42.56]It would be right in front of me and down.
[88:45.86]No.
[88:46.56]It would be up here and facing down.
[88:48.90]Right in front of the monitor.
[88:50.79]In the center.
[88:53.29]This is podcaster angle.
[88:54.63]Yeah.
[89:10.61]The mic in frame is a choice.
[89:12.39]No, it's not.
[89:12.97]I got nowhere else to put it.
[89:15.08]If I put it down, you won't be able to hear me.
[89:16.86]Everyone will call me Audio Andy.
[89:18.30]Alright, let me read this.
[89:23.42]So I can down special on the popcorn and the cars to blow them up.
[89:28.55]That's pretty cool.
[89:36.05]Start time.
[89:40.39]The mic shouldn't be that far from your mouth.
[89:43.59]Wait, here's the thing.
[89:45.33]If it's here, then I can't see the screen.
[89:50.61]This sucks.
[89:52.39]Alright, I'll try one match like this.
[89:54.90]And you can't see my face.
[90:00.54]No, I can't see the screen.
[90:21.17]That was crazy.
[90:21.67]I don't know what he's doing.
[90:48.06]What is he doing?
[90:48.88]I can do that?
[90:49.62]Can I do that move?
[91:05.61]Oh, we both did it.
[91:44.79]Let's go.
[91:45.12]Let's go.
[91:45.46]Come on.
[92:42.27]alright oh I got saved sorry alright let's make it happen
[93:11.09]Jeez, almost came back.
[93:11.81]Nice fight.
[93:23.46]You're playing like a fighter pilot.
[93:26.02]I move, man.
[93:26.90]I gotta.
[93:27.32]I have to move around.
[93:30.02]This chair is... Electricity is surging through this chair.
[93:33.14]Alright, how about...
[93:42.01]Should I change character and just get absolutely decimated?
[93:44.25]I feel like that's a bad idea.
[93:46.13]I feel like I got the rhythm with Gizmo right now.
[93:52.64]We'll do Gizmo for another one match or so.
[93:54.80]And then I'll play some Morty.
[93:56.36]I gotta see what the hell he does.
[94:01.08]Interesting.
[94:03.68]Iron Giant versus Gizmo.
[94:05.22]I feel like I'm gonna get pretty destroyed here.
[94:19.74]Your title would be lying?
[94:20.78]I don't know if it would be lying.
[94:28.74]Alright, let's see what I can do.
[94:34.73]Are we in?
[94:35.37]Is this the Scooby Doo level?
[94:36.37]Oh, this is going to be bad.
[94:37.21]I lose.
[94:37.67]I don't think it's possible I can win this.
[94:49.74]Although he's kind of huge though.
[95:24.45]Oh, Jesus.
[95:27.73]WHAT THE HECK?!
[95:50.26]Oh my god, I can't bounce him!
[96:16.24]I'm in trouble.
[96:27.33]I knew this was gonna be a major problem.
[96:36.12]What the?
[96:37.40]To die!
[96:44.75]I'm too small to get rid of him.
[96:46.75]Okay.
[96:47.71]I gotta go for something weird here.
[96:55.97]Alright, I'm gonna go for something weird and see if I can do it.
[96:58.11]He's too big.
[97:16.87]Alright, if you stick with Iron Giant, then I'm gonna have to go... Superman.
[97:28.38]I don't have Superman?
[97:31.56]What?
[97:31.74]Didn't I have?
[97:33.58]Didn't I unlock Superman?
[97:37.46]He's level seven.
[97:38.38]Oh, he was free rotation.
[97:49.29]Alright, I gotta remember how to play with Superman.
[97:57.45]Change the announcer.
[97:59.47]I don't have any other announcers!
[98:09.82]I have LeBron, Taz, and then the default, right?
[98:12.62]I don't think I have anybody else.
[98:15.88]Start time!
[98:27.09]Change it back to LeBron?
[98:33.58]Alright, let's make this happen.
[99:31.31]Watch yourself!
[100:02.87]I was doing something!
[100:03.79]Alright, I'm done.
[100:05.37]Let's go.
[100:05.69]I'm done with this.
[100:06.53]Let's see how iron does against steel.
[100:46.05]Are you kidding me?
[100:48.73]What?
[101:34.14]You just can't watch him.
[101:39.06]Someone just says, you suck.
[102:04.67]I'm naked.
[102:08.00]No, I'm not naked.
[102:23.14]Your mic cuts.
[102:23.72]It's because I scream too much and my audio sucks.
[102:30.84]I keep forgetting to do the announcer.
[102:43.66]Professional Andy.
[102:45.12]I'm a professional Andy.
[102:46.40]We're going to, we're going to see just how good, and it does feel weird looking, although you have no idea how far away you are.
[102:52.58]It's strange.
[103:03.68]Athena guide my blade.
[103:05.13]Alright, let's go.
[103:05.95]Let's go.
[103:41.08]What the hell?
[103:41.74]I pressed buttons and it didn't happen!
[103:46.02]Did you see that stunt?
[104:27.56]Ooh, nice.
[104:30.24]Ooh!
[105:21.23]That was a lucky shot.
[107:28.97]You look like you eat pizza with a fork.
[107:30.38]Who cares?
[107:30.92]Eat food the way you like to eat food.
[107:32.18]Why do you have to judge people for the way they eat their pizza?
[107:45.86]Eat it crust side first.
[107:49.15]For all I care.
[107:50.29]I think that's a good gizmo one to go out on.
[107:54.06]Let's let's try Morty.
[107:56.30]I'll try Morty.
[107:57.18]Oh now it's there.
[108:03.33]Oh my God, I keep forgetting.
[108:04.21]I'm sorry.
[108:07.07]I have no idea what Morty does, so let's just kind of get beat here.
[108:15.17]This is kind of free points.
[108:16.99]I'm very honest.
[108:33.20]Do the voice.
[108:34.04]Just wait till I fall off the screen accidentally.
[108:36.38]You'll hear it.
[108:36.82]I don't know what these moves do, but they're cool.
[108:53.01]It really does sound like a chicken or a turkey.
[109:19.86]I like that line too.
[109:50.98]He's kind of cracked, if I'm honest.
[109:52.89]He's kind of ridiculous.
[109:59.21]Dirt!
[110:11.88]What the heck?
[110:13.04]Red point, red point!
[110:15.86]Just focus on the mission, alright?
[110:57.40]oh I didn't know what the moves were he's kind of cracked I just don't know what he does
[111:25.49]Oh, jeez.
[111:26.61]You should do another you laugh, you lose.
[111:28.73]We can set it up.
[111:35.50]Let's go back to the tried and true.
[111:36.82]See if I still got it.
[111:59.91]I could have had that.
[112:01.59]If I tried to really pull that together, I probably could have had it.
[112:09.38]They nerfed Bugs.
[112:10.06]Well, they did.
[112:12.90]He was really good, though.
[112:14.30]Bugs was amazing.
[112:17.50]So, makes sense.
[112:20.71]Cha-cha-ra-cha-cha Cha-cha-ra-cha-cha
[112:54.35]Ain't that a kick in the head?
[113:00.00]You'll get a kick out of this one!
[113:49.33]Oh, almost had it.
[113:50.61]Red point, red point.
[113:56.67]Of course you realize this means war.
[114:25.34]Check this out.
[114:34.73]Where is it?
[114:37.17]Where is it?
[114:42.34]There it is.
[115:01.43]Damn!
[115:03.17]Jesus.
[115:09.36]Blow point!
[115:14.58]Blow point!
[115:17.76]Athena, I won't let you down.
[115:38.11]I could have tried to finish that up, I was too scared.
[116:15.11]no one can resist the lasso of truth gamer potato sets in
[117:16.30]Oh no!
[117:20.67]Winner!
[117:21.95]Winner!
[117:22.57]Winner!
[117:23.29]Winner!
[117:24.27]I can feel the fatigue just fitting onto me.
[117:32.43]I didn't land... I think I only landed one of the Batmove.
[117:36.77]They really did nerf that, huh?
[117:39.03]That was a good match though.
[117:46.77]So the Batmove has less hit frames, right?
[117:53.12]Stop drinking ethanol?
[117:56.66]I don't... I don't do that.
[117:57.78]Stop spreading rumors.
[118:03.78]Alright, I will change the announcer, I promise.
[118:06.24]Come on, pick character.
[118:12.36]Okay.
[118:14.18]I've got default announcer, LeBron, Kaz.
[118:17.37]Here comes the heat.
[118:21.61]Come on, pick character.
[118:23.51]I don't have enough coins.
[118:26.43]Choose a character.
[118:27.79]Who are you going to send in?
[118:29.57]Who are you going to play as?
[118:32.96]Ooh, pick your team.
[118:35.25]You must select your combatant.
[118:37.41]You can choose.
[118:39.81]Oh, man.
[118:40.67]Who are you going to choose?
[118:42.27]Choose your fighter.
[118:44.13]Pick your fighter, pal.
[118:46.81]Who are you going to put in the ring?
[118:49.37]Zoinks.
[118:49.79]A lot of fighters to choose from, man.
[118:52.18]That's definitely the best one.
[118:54.84]Choose your character.
[118:56.74]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[119:03.27]Alright, time to select your character.
[119:05.59]I was not ready for the laugh at the end of that.
[119:09.01]Zoinks, a lot of fighters to choose from, man.
[119:11.77]Ah, it's Shaggy.
[119:13.35]I don't have any coins.
[119:15.58]Do I get... Whoa, hold on a second.
[119:27.41]250 gold.
[119:29.97]Hold on a second.
[119:30.83]Excuse me.
[119:34.81]Alright, 70% win rate.
[119:36.09]That's pretty good.
[119:42.91]I'll take 70%.
[119:43.25]Do I have a premium token?
[119:54.48]Oh, dude, I have one.
[119:55.32]I have one.
[119:56.80]Oh, shit.
[119:57.18]Alright, that means I get all this stuff.
[119:58.32]Oh, I get... Okay.
[120:06.86]So I got a Raindog Taunt.
[120:09.34]I got a Taz skin.
[120:10.94]I already had tokens.
[120:11.76]Okay, cool.
[120:14.70]Happy Finn.
[120:18.02]Hover Taunt from Superman.
[120:18.94]Alright, let's do some teams.
[120:27.39]I'm just going to mess around with teams.
[120:31.59]We'll close it out with teams.
[120:35.50]Yeah, so they're going to be adding Black Adam and Stripe will be coming at some point soon.
[120:41.75]During, I think, this season.
[120:44.49]I'm curious with how Stripe... Stripe is going to be a bruiser, I'd imagine.
[120:53.87]Alright, let's do some teams.
[120:59.45]Do I stick with Gizmo or do I play with somebody else?
[121:01.23]I feel like... Well, let's try the new skin.
[121:03.47]I mean, come on.
[121:06.66]Is Taz any good anymore?
[121:07.52]I haven't really played with Taz at all.
[121:18.79]You don't... It's still Taz?
[121:20.39]Well, yeah, because I don't have any currency.
[121:25.07]I don't have any in-game money.
[121:35.22]That's not Gizmo?
[121:36.80]That's close enough.
[121:40.60]This is Chad Gizmo.
[121:53.51]Have any of you guys actually been really putting time into the game?
[122:00.13]Who do you think is the best character in the game right now?
[122:11.09]Jake?
[122:13.13]Is it Gizmo?
[122:14.07]Gizmo feels really good.
[122:15.09]Oh boy.
[122:26.14]Oh, I caught them both.
[122:26.80]Uh oh.
[122:40.47]In Aria.
[122:48.36]Wait, you can do his sandwich more than a few times, right?
[123:24.39]Ooh, got it.
[123:26.33]Not good enough though.
[123:27.08]Where am I?
[123:27.60]Where's my character?
[123:28.32]I died.
[123:29.08]What was that voice, by the way?
[123:31.24]That was like a please put this in the YouTube video voice.
[123:35.46]I just pulled this back.
[123:58.12]Oh, we did it.
[124:00.30]Raindog, nice job.
[124:01.48]I don't know.
[124:01.90]I kind of don't know what happened, but whatever.
[124:28.60]He's not in the Reddit room anymore.
[124:30.78]Oh, that's right.
[124:31.54]It looks different, doesn't it?
[124:39.25]How's Otto?
[124:39.69]Otto's doing great.
[124:40.45]He's a little chunky, but we're working on it.
[124:59.24]Let's do that.
[125:10.97]We'll do a few more.
[125:18.15]We should see him again.
[125:19.31]Alright.
[125:19.59]On the next stream, I'll show Otto.
[125:22.33]I'll let you see the dog.
[125:24.37]He's doing good.
[125:25.01]He's happy.
[125:29.92]I think he's just hanging out.
[125:30.58]I think he's sleeping in the other room.
[125:37.16]Alright, let's go.
[125:41.42]I ran out of water.
[125:42.04]I was too busy putting it in my eyes.
[125:54.74]Remember to blink when you're in those deep gaming hours, guys.
[126:04.62]I just got stuck on the lip.
[126:42.56]That's how you get it done!
[126:45.41]Yeah, baby!
[126:46.61]Use it like a girl!
[126:50.43]Excuse me!
[126:52.57]I'll vanquish you!
[126:54.67]Watch this!
[126:56.30]Ferryman won't have me yet.
[127:25.56]What happened?
[127:33.00]Does Harley Quinn have a TV show?
[127:35.28]A new TV show?
[127:35.96]Why didn't it just jump off?
[127:44.47]Is it any good?
[127:47.93]Looks like you lassoed up another victory.
[127:52.38]It's not new and it's three seasons old.
[127:54.24]Oh, is it any good though?
[127:56.60]It's okay.
[128:05.57]I love chat.
[128:07.59]The only place where I can look over here and see, yeah, it's pretty decent.
[128:10.79]And then right underneath that.
[128:12.90]It's fucking awful, dude.
[128:27.96]I feel like I'm neglecting LeBron.
[128:32.03]I really like LeBron.
[128:40.71]Asking thousands of people their opinion on something.
[128:42.69]Yeah, it's just funny though.
[128:44.43]Just looking over and seeing it in real time.
[128:58.91]Batman's fun.
[129:02.03]I feel like I need to go through and play all the characters again.
[129:05.47]Just in the lab.
[129:06.25]Because I really did just pick Bugs Bunny because I love the Looney Tunes.
[129:11.15]What the hell is this?
[129:27.34]Gizmo's so fun.
[129:38.42]I don't think Elmo is owned by Warner Brothers.
[129:40.72]Sorry, guys.
[129:41.20]I don't know if that's possible.
[129:44.54]I'm not sure Big Bird can be in this game.
[130:09.32]What's happening Oh my god, that move is crazy
[130:58.25]No, don't throw the basket.
[131:00.13]Oh!
[131:31.01]Huh?
[131:34.75]Someone make this stop!
[131:37.34]Why did I just sink?
[131:38.30]Blow point!
[131:42.00]Blow point!
[131:57.36]Alright, we got it.
[132:00.44]I got big arms.
[132:07.89]Alright, we're going Gizmo again.
[132:13.81]Alright, one more.
[132:14.59]One more.
[132:14.91]One more.
[132:15.25]One more.
[132:15.65]One more.
[132:16.13]One more Gizmo.
[132:17.35]One more.
[132:29.19]They want to do Gizmo, then I can do that.
[132:37.85]Like that, yeah.
[132:39.63]Give me money.
[133:03.90]The mic ruined it?
[133:05.40]This mic stinks.
[133:11.84]This mic stinks.
[133:13.27]I'm done with it.
[133:24.95]It eats every weird noise.
[133:26.49]It eats every funny noise you make.
[133:27.71]I don't know why.
[133:34.64]Okay, can... If I do it now, can you hear it now?
[133:40.74]Did that come through or did that get blocked out?
[133:50.41]So wait, it's only high noises.
[133:51.99]That's weird.
[133:52.55]There must be some pitch that this mic does not like.
[133:56.84]Alright, this is it.
[134:01.26]Last one.
[134:01.56]Let's go.
[134:01.84]Let's do it.
[134:03.52]Let's make it happen.
[134:39.57]Watch out.
[135:27.42]He didn't get hit by that?
[135:28.24]That's kind of weird.
[135:31.84]Alright, we gotta... Can we launch somebody out of here, please?
[135:36.36]What are we doing?
[135:36.90]Alright, I'm just like pressing buttons.
[135:40.47]I gotta like actually play the game.
[135:52.23]What the hell?
[135:53.49]I... What happened?
[135:54.37]I... What?
[135:55.67]I pressed jump.
[135:56.57]Why didn't I now jump?
[135:59.38]Alright, do, do, do... Huh?
[136:02.26]Huh?
[136:03.98]Get out of here!
[136:10.88]Huh.
[136:11.16]That was better than I thought.
[136:26.74]Oh my goodness.
[136:28.31]Can you?
[136:42.88]Let's pull together here.
[137:15.78]Isn't that priority?
[137:22.80]What happened?
[137:23.42]Why couldn't I move?
[137:25.94]Excuse me?
[137:26.74]What?
[137:27.72]I just sink to the ground.
[137:30.33]You heard me smashing buttons.
[137:31.65]What the fuck just happened?
[137:39.53]I just went like this.
[137:42.17]I'm just sunk to the ground.
[137:43.54]Did I lose connection?
[137:48.71]That one doesn't count.
[137:56.57]That one doesn't count.
[138:05.66]I literally just turned into a pencil and went straight down and I was pressing buttons.
[138:24.50]It counted for us, Sag.
[138:26.38]I'm sorry.
[138:26.86]I'll do better.
[138:51.58]They have a Jake, though.
[138:52.93]That's my kryptonite.
[139:09.24]A lot of my points are on the line.
[139:10.40]A lot of you are voting for... Is that for me or against me?
[139:16.77]Because that's a lot.
[139:18.03]That's a big difference.
[139:26.16]Start time.
[139:27.28]Oh, OK.
[139:30.28]So you do believe.
[139:32.28]Let me try to reward you.
[139:46.83]It is real.
[141:26.28]Oh, it's alright.
[141:31.36]It's alright.
[141:33.50]Oh, that was a good block from Jake.
[141:39.93]What's going on?
[141:40.55]I guess I freak out.
[141:43.39]Let's go.
[142:03.87]Okay, alright, we're ahead.
[142:12.76]Nice and zen, baby.
[142:50.70]Red point!
[142:51.32]Red point!
[142:55.70]Blue point!

[143:01.16]Winner!
[143:01.88]We won!
[143:02.36]You guys got your points.
[143:12.20]Look at that damage.
[143:17.25]Alright.
[143:19.19]One more.
[143:20.84]And then I'm out of here.
[143:21.50]And then I will be back and we'll do some more art.
[143:26.50]Maybe some more 20 Minutes Till Dawn.
[143:30.87]I'll be back on Sunday.
[143:34.29]Sunday the 11th here.
[143:38.11]Maybe Saturday.
[143:38.74]We'll see.
[143:45.02]Maybe sorcery.
[143:46.34]Could be any of those things.
[143:49.50]I want to do one more 1v1.
[144:01.33]Last 1v1.
[144:04.00]And I want to play a character that I want... Because if I keep doing... I'm going to do Taz 1v1.
[144:09.84]I'm very curious.
[144:15.28]Also, yeah, thanks Warner Brothers again for sponsoring the stream.
[144:18.26]I genuinely love playing this game, so it's just, that's really awesome that I can just get sponsored to do it.
[144:28.23]Game's really fun.
[144:29.61]If you haven't checked it out, season one is underway right now.
[144:37.53]I think that we're going to see some more characters and probably ranked and some other stuff.
[144:46.23]Don't do sorcery on Sunday.
[144:47.53]We'll figure it out.
[144:51.53]I don't know if I would bet on this one.
[144:52.67]It's a 1v1 with a character I haven't been playing.
[145:03.94]Yeah, I love taking sponsors like this because I actually like this game.
[145:10.60]I really, really do.
[145:11.34]So, it's perfect.
[145:12.39]Alright, let's see if I can do it.
[145:37.55]What the fuck is going on?
[145:40.72]What the hell is happening?
[146:11.75]I'm so confused.
[147:10.59]Did you vote for me?
[147:11.23]Because I did not think I was going to win that.
[147:13.67]Alright, that's it.
[147:20.92]Warner Brothers, thanks a lot for the sponsor.
[147:22.44]Seriously, the game's awesome.
[147:24.48]Season 1 is underway.
[147:25.36]Gizmo's in the game.
[147:26.94]Morty's in the game.
[147:27.82]And we'll see you again.
[147:40.82]you
[148:21.14]This one doesn't count.
[148:21.74]It's just an extra bonus one.
[148:27.63]I mean, I have to do the rematch.
[148:28.53]I can't just say no.
[148:29.11]That's not how it works.
[148:33.11]If somebody says rematch, you say, alright, let's go for it.
[148:35.57]Unless there's internet problems.
[148:36.49]Come on.
[148:40.69]Unwritten rule.
[150:01.34]Blue point!
[150:02.27]Blue point!

[152:19.42]I've been having a lot of fun playing games lately.
[152:20.82]Have you noticed that?
[152:22.90]The last five or six games, like, it's time for gamer streams.
[152:27.84]I've been having a lot of fun.
[152:28.52]I kind of feel like I'm getting back into it.

[152:48.27]Binding of Isaac?
[152:49.14]Um, I'd probably rather play Cult of the Lamb before Binding of Isaac again.
[152:51.92]If I'm completely honest.
[153:04.03]You go do your homework if you haven't done it.
[153:05.25]Come on.
[153:07.29]Somebody said I'm not doing my homework.
[153:08.85]I've been watching.
[153:09.39]Make sure you, you know, do as much as you can.
[153:23.51]Do as much as you can, right?
[153:32.29]Dude, his teacher is watching right now.
[153:39.31]Can't make me dad.
