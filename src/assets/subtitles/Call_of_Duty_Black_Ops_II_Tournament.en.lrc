[ve:61.7.100]

[00:04.27]How we doing?
[00:06.36]Good afternoon.
[00:07.22]How are we doing?
[00:07.82]Good, good, good, good, good.
[00:12.12]You are currently joining me and us for a Black Ops 2 tournament.
[00:22.61]It's being hosted by Myth.
[00:26.58]I'm very, very scared.
[00:29.30]I don't... I played Call of Duty a little bit.
[00:32.22]I was kind of a Call of Duty player for... I want to say just to desperately make YouTube videos.
[00:39.53]I was like, oh, I know.
[00:41.51]I'll just play Black Ops 2 or something.
[00:45.75]And I made some terrible fucking videos.
[00:49.65]I played for about an hour.
[00:52.03]This is the, uh, this is the perspective that you want to watch if you want to, uh, make fun of the streamer.
[00:58.31]Uh, if you want to ask, like, oh, dude, what the fuck is this guy doing here?
[01:03.26]You know what I mean?
[01:05.94]Like, I'll be the pincushion today, right?
[01:08.46]If you want to come talk shit to somebody today, just stay here.
[01:12.83]If I go 0 and 30, I'll get at least, like, a dozen kills, okay?
[01:19.23]I can promise you that.
[01:23.53]I will accept, I will be the vacuum for all the negativity today.
[01:29.50]It's going to be really fun.
[01:30.68]I'm actually excited.
[01:32.30]But I actually might surprise you.
[01:34.68]We'll see.
[01:37.94]I might surprise you today.
[01:43.07]We'll find out.
[01:47.61]Currently just running around in the, we're doing a free-for-all.
[01:53.87]Get the earwig ready.
[01:55.65]Dude, I'm... I don't even know what guns to use.
[02:01.72]In chat, like 20 minutes ago, I was like, what's a good weapon to use?
[02:07.18]I don't know.
[02:08.72]I genuinely have no fucking idea.
[02:11.08]I just remember rapid fire, extended mags, submachine gun.
[02:14.88]That's it.
[02:17.27]I'm just going to hold the button down.
[02:18.57]I'm going to play Pyro.
[02:23.72]Can you guys hear the game?
[02:26.92]Let me see how we're doing here.
[02:32.63]They just stuck with it.
[02:33.55]They would have gotten the big one and all even out.
[02:37.43]We're still kind of preparing.
[02:39.49]Don't worry.
[02:40.07]I will show.
[02:41.73]I just got a kill.
[02:49.03]I actually just got a kill.
[02:50.07]You just didn't see it.
[02:53.12]Should I even use grenades?
[02:54.40]Alright, I'm good to go.
[03:04.65]What's up, everybody?
[03:06.77]I'm just hoping to get one kill this whole entire event.
[03:12.95]They're just updating it real quick.
[03:14.69]I just want to make sure I was not behind.
[03:22.03]That was not me.
[03:28.15]You hear like Are we playing zombies?
[03:34.72]No, actually, I don't know the format.
[03:38.16]I think I think we met team team deathmatch.
[03:41.54]Domination probably.
[03:45.00]Yeah, we're just we're still preparing.
[03:55.21]You have to play zombies.
[03:58.31]Wait, wait, wait.
[03:58.91]Do we have some advice here?
[04:02.57]From experience, cigarette smokers perform 20% when I'm not going to read the rest of that.
[04:07.11]Thank you for the comment, though.
[04:10.65]Game's too violent.
[04:11.53]I don't know if I can watch.
[04:12.39]I think we're going to get started.
[04:18.31]I don't know what to say.
[04:19.81]This is going to be fucked up.
[04:27.12]Did they ban Rivers of Blood?
[04:28.36]Oh yeah, it's banned.
[04:31.66]We're missing a teammate?
[04:33.32]I... I'm pretty sure we... A couple people had to drop just because of the change to this week.
[04:40.70]So we have a couple of new teammates, I think.
[04:47.64]From my understanding.
[04:48.50]But we'll get started shortly.
[04:49.50]Somebody just dove out of the window.
[04:52.50]I would be showing this, but I think we're going to restart the server, so... Oh yeah.
[04:58.43]Alright, you know what?
[04:58.91]Do a prediction.
[04:59.51]How about this?
[05:02.55]Will I place at one point in the top two of... No.
[05:08.07]Top three of my team.
[05:13.00]Will I place in the top three point-wise on the team at any point during the entire night?
[05:21.64]No.
[05:22.00]Sorry, King.
[05:22.63]No.
[05:28.73]Who is he talking to?
[05:30.19]You!
[05:30.77]I'm talking to you!
[05:48.00]So should we go to our team channels now?
[05:52.49]Who's on team two?
[05:58.76]I don't know.
[06:04.20]If you're on team two, let's hop down to team two.
[06:08.44]Which is team two.
[06:09.22]Yes, chef.
[06:11.40]Yes, chef.
[06:14.26]I forgot where they're at.
[06:18.99]Event info.
[06:21.65]I'm in the team two lobby.
[06:24.91]Alright, here.
[06:26.51]Let's start streaming, huh?
[06:27.53]What do you say?
[06:28.07]Okay.
[06:35.84]Derma.
[06:37.14]Hey!
[06:37.62]This is our first time playing together, I think.
[06:40.72]I know.
[06:41.78]Well, wait.
[06:42.36]No, we did the battleship tournament.
[06:45.37]Oh, yeah, I totally forgot about that.
[06:48.79]Yeah, you absolutely destroyed me in one of our games.
[06:51.97]It was actually pretty close.
[06:53.39]Pretty close, actually.
[06:55.25]How much of a Call of Duty guy are you?
[06:58.23]I played when I was 13.
[06:59.25]Yeah.
[07:00.47]And that's about it.
[07:04.29]I'm kind of sad I couldn't get my controller to work with plutonium, but... Oh, you were going controller?
[07:10.96]Well, okay, this is kind of a weird thing to say, but if you use controller in this game, you get aim assist.
[07:17.60]You do?
[07:17.96]Yeah, so like your crosshair will just lock on to them.
[07:24.97]If you're like slightly off, it just locks on.
[07:27.55]That seems amazing.
[07:28.61]I should plug it in.
[07:29.69]Does it work or no?
[07:30.31]Yeah, yeah.
[07:30.83]If you can get it to work, it's definitely a lot better.
[07:35.31]The person was standing still and I couldn't even kill him.
[07:39.06]I'm so bad at this game.
[07:41.00]I can get it to do everything, but walk around.
[07:48.26]Xbox controller?
[07:48.86]I love the Switch controller.
[07:51.28]It's kind of weird, but... What did you say?
[07:55.32]Switch controller?
[07:56.70]Yeah, yeah.
[07:57.16]I like the Switch Pro controller.
[07:58.48]It just fits my hand better.
[08:00.09]I don't know why I was thinking about the... I thought you had Joy-Cons in your hand.
[08:03.09]I don't know why, for some reason.
[08:04.55]Oh, not that.
[08:05.19]I mean the Switch Pro controller.
[08:06.47]That's...
[08:07.54]It's pretty much an Xbox controller, but slightly smaller.
[08:13.56]I Yeah, that's like the best controller.
[08:15.51]Oh, you mentioned it.
[08:16.23]Yeah, I think I have one somewhere like, yeah, depends on hand size.
[08:20.19]But for me, it's like, I like the Xbox controller.
[08:24.19]Well, that one fits my hand a little better.
[08:26.51]So it's kind of Yeah, but the PlayStation five and four.
[08:33.67]My thumbs bump into each other all the time.
[08:36.79]Oh, God.
[08:37.27]They go like... Oh, yeah, yeah.
[08:38.39]That's me with the PlayStation, yeah.
[08:40.07]Yeah.
[08:40.65]Not my favorite.
[08:43.59]Not bad, but... Oh, he just got me.
[08:47.31]Got me right in the head.
[08:48.15]Was it in the head?
[08:49.19]Yeah, I was using... Okay, so... Wait, have you played Call of Duty before?
[08:52.60]That was pretty good.
[08:53.30]That was pretty good.
[08:55.12]Yeah, just a little bit.
[08:57.25]There's a cheese build in Call of Duty that used to be all the rage for highlight reels called quickscoping, where you just get a sniper and you run around and try and snipe them really, really fast.
[09:13.05]So you're a quickscoper?
[09:15.65]Well, I like doing it, but I'm not good at it.
[09:20.99]That's what you would see in all the highlight reels, though.
[09:23.62]I had a video series on Machinima Respawn like 10 years ago where I played Call of Duty.
[09:31.47]And it was... I mean, I was playing a character.
[09:36.27]It was not really me playing.
[09:37.73]It was, but it wasn't.
[09:39.86]This gun is disgusting.
[09:41.38]What is this thing?
[09:43.06]Should I use this?
[09:44.42]Oh, that's an LMG.
[09:46.48]Okay, I'm going to be honest.
[09:48.36]The guns I recommend is the Fall.
[09:51.29]I think it's the Assault Rifle.
[09:53.93]That one's pretty good.
[09:57.54]Yeah, I got, let me see.
[10:00.49]I got the PDW-57, Scorpion, Type 25, LSAT, and the SVU-AS.
[10:09.80]Are those okay?
[10:14.28]Um, yeah, but I'm telling you, the fall is insane.
[10:17.16]Okay.
[10:19.40]You're on my team, right?
[10:20.54]Yeah.
[10:21.63]Yeah, yeah, the fall, um, OST or something?
[10:26.19]Fall OSW.
[10:27.55]It's an assault rifle.
[10:28.41]It's a single fire.
[10:29.35]Oh, it's single fire.
[10:31.97]It's pretty much the best gun in the game.
[10:35.80]Is this the game that had the Akimbo?
[10:39.62]What was it?
[10:39.96]The Akimbo Scorpions or something?
[10:41.66]Oh, I don't know if this specific one has it, but one of the Call of Duties has that.
[10:46.71]I remember people wanted that banned.
[10:48.43]People freaked out over that.
[10:50.34]Yeah, so the fall is actually also banned.
[10:53.00]Oh, it's banned?
[10:55.28]In the old tournaments of this game, it was banned because it's pretty much objectively the best gun.
[11:00.20]It kills in the least amount of bullets.
[11:03.98]When I go back, I might put it on.
[11:06.84]I might leave and put it on.
[11:08.46]I would definitely put it on, but I mean, it depends if you're like a sprayer.
[11:13.53]It's not good for spraying.
[11:15.45]Yeah, I'm kind of a hold the button down and hope that somebody dies.
[11:19.74]Yeah, yeah.
[11:20.26]So if you're a sprayer, maybe I'd go for like the AN-94 solid.
[11:26.08]I mean, honestly, the gun you're using is pretty decent too.
[11:30.24]It's just reducing move speed.
[11:31.96]Yeah, so somebody in chat just copy and pasted this build and I just put it in here.
[11:36.36]I was like, yeah, sure.
[11:41.23]I'll try it for a little bit.
[11:44.17]It was just a copy and paste.
[11:46.68]I mean I think the thing about call of duty is you can't really go too wrong because every gun kills in like two seconds not even not even two seconds honestly so it's like just how it goes kind of did the game start yet wait we don't play okay I was like wait we're playing we only have you and me here still yeah we're killing each other so surely we're not playing yet right hello hey yo oh hey
[12:16.04]We got half the team here.
[12:17.20]Are you guys ready to win?
[12:19.26]Oh, okay.
[12:19.66]So we have half the team.
[12:20.76]Okay, cool.
[12:21.46]So now I'm not in like a huge rush to make a class real quick.
[12:25.37]Yeah, I've got about maybe 12 total hours in Call of Duty.
[12:31.05]I'm going to need a hard carry.
[12:33.13]Oh, no.
[12:33.95]That's more than me, honestly.
[12:39.54]You know what?
[12:39.82]I think I might surprise a lot of people, though.
[12:41.50]Once I get in the game mode.
[12:43.92]You know, if it means anything, I've never seen you be bad at a game before, so.
[12:48.94]I'm okay.
[12:49.76]I can be okay sometimes.
[12:51.97]Kaylee, is everything good on your end?
[12:52.99]Very humble.
[12:53.97]We gotta play multi versus.
[12:54.87]Yes.
[12:55.61]Okay.
[12:55.97]Yes, I got everything figured out.
[12:57.81]Chat's just mad at the resolution.
[12:59.59]Oh, okay.
[13:00.79]Is the resolution wonky?
[13:01.69]Yeah, you just fix it in settings though.
[13:05.43]Oh, sick.
[13:05.93]Shit.
[13:06.53]Okay.
[13:07.15]Are we doing a server or custom class?
[13:11.08]server.
[13:12.36]So your classes have to be made under the ranked setting.
[13:17.60]And then make your classes there and then we'll go to server browser and then we'll... Okay.
[13:23.58]Okay.
[13:23.90]Oh, I got a medal.
[13:42.12]Ooh.
[13:42.56]Wait, Mithy, you're on our team?
[13:45.86]Yeah, I'm on your guys' team.
[13:46.82]Ooh.
[13:47.70]Let's go.
[13:48.36]Okay.
[13:48.74]So I'm kind of the equivalent to John.
[13:51.22]And so I think it actually, the balance is actually pretty good still.
[13:54.92]Okay, cool.
[13:55.42]Cool, cool.
[13:59.51]Ooh.
[14:01.23]I'm glad you're on my team.
[14:02.93]I think I just killed like four people with a knife.
[14:11.81]I'll make it five.
[14:12.43]Oh, I forgot the knife.
[14:16.73]You're doing the shotgun thing.
[14:17.97]Okay.
[14:18.55]The knife is instant kill no matter what, right?
[14:21.03]The Moss Borg.
[14:22.23]Yeah, the knife is an instant kill.
[14:23.83]It's kind of OP.
[14:24.33]Did I just flash myself?
[14:50.63]Wait, you're like doing drop shots and stuff.
[14:52.85]Jesus.
[14:54.07]Sure you haven't played this before?
[14:55.57]That's the first time I've clicked that button, I think, in the whole time we've been here.
[14:59.46]Oh, okay.
[15:00.28]It's like a thing people would sometimes do.
[15:03.30]They randomly just lay on the floor to try and dodge bullets and stuff.
[15:09.92]You're killing people that are AFK.
[15:11.34]No, I'm not.
[15:12.00]Everyone's warming up.
[15:14.21]Yeah, yeah.
[15:14.55]We're mostly just trying to get used to our keybinds and sensitivity.
[15:18.19]I mean, it's not...
[15:21.16]No way.
[15:21.52]No way.
[15:23.14]No way.
[15:25.20]It seems I am not the only spy.
[15:28.27]You know what you could do?
[15:29.87]Make one of those ballistic knife running builds or whatever.
[15:33.63]Oh, you shoot it out, right?
[15:36.25]Yeah, yeah.
[15:40.55]I keep hitting R with the LMG and that's not good.
[15:54.52]I gotta keep, I gotta do that more often.
[15:55.83]That works.
[15:56.23]Getting control when you start shooting people.
[16:00.59]Like to... In what case, in what scenario?
[16:04.49]Just anytime I'm firing at anybody, I just take control and I go down.
[16:11.33]Huh.
[16:12.65]Is that smart or stupid?
[16:14.54]Bro, I haven't played this since 2012.
[16:16.38]I know, right?
[16:20.53]It's so funny.
[16:20.97]Half our team is just like, oh yeah, I played Call of Duty on the toilet one time.
[16:25.01]It's like half our team.
[16:27.13]2012, this game was released.
[16:33.69]And I don't even think I played it on PC on top of that.
[16:35.87]Yeah, like on a console or something.
[16:41.78]Hey, it's alright.
[16:42.22]We have a couple people that are going to hard carry us.
[16:44.80]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[16:48.23]I haven't even gotten warmed up yet.
[16:50.74]I'm still making my classes.
[16:51.82]Is Scorpion any good?
[16:52.74]Should I try Scorpion?
[16:59.74]Scorpion is pretty good.
[17:00.86]It has really good time to shoot super fast.
[17:07.28]I think it's good.
[17:08.23]I haven't played this in quite some time.
[17:13.45]I'm never taking this off.
[17:15.24]Bro, there's no way.
[17:16.16]You just... Oh my... Dude, you run out of ammo so fast.
[17:20.82]What happens if you run out of ammo?
[17:22.94]Well, you should... Is that it?
[17:26.64]I think if you have Scavenger on, it should be fine.
[17:29.88]So the strat is to pick up someone else's gun.
[17:32.38]Are we doing S and D?
[17:35.84]what's the game what do we do for game mode I'm guessing it's 5v5 so I'm guessing it's an s d yeah right oh no uh so just go to um the tournament browser or the sorry browser and then it's the server on there I think I'm going to use this wait sorry was that not the question did I come in I um I was saying like the the um this is times two
[18:05.26]Oh, so it's going to be Hardpoint, Dom, and SND.
[18:09.54]Ooh, okay.
[18:11.14]Are you almost ready, Kaylee?
[18:14.27]Yeah, I'm almost done making my classes.
[18:15.67]Sorry.
[18:16.55]Okay.
[18:29.16]Whoa, that's really bad.
[18:32.53]Hello?
[18:32.65]You guys hear me?
[18:34.32]Yep.
[18:34.68]Yes.
[18:35.10]That doesn't fucking... My audio... My mic is, like, bugging.
[18:38.96]Should be fine, though.
[18:39.88]You sound pretty clean.
[18:40.55]You're here.
[18:41.07]Alright, cool.
[18:43.01]I can hear you.
[18:43.71]Alright, let me make one more class just in case, and then...
[19:17.88]Did I already spawn here?
[19:18.56]If you don't spawn in line of sight.
[19:36.85]Oh.
[19:38.41]Oh.
[19:38.51]All right.
[19:43.47]idiot.
[19:45.39]I'm baffled.
[19:47.75]I'm just walking into walls.
[19:50.99]I was testing something.
[19:52.17]What am I doing over here?
[19:56.15]I'm worse than a bot right now.
[20:11.78]I do like this gun, though.
[20:12.56]I'm going to keep it.
[20:20.02]Yeah, this thing you just have to just let the game play for you.
[20:30.28]Why are you using Target Finder?
[20:31.56]What's that?
[20:31.82]What do you mean?
[20:43.69]Do I have target?
[20:44.35]What does that mean?
[20:51.49]I hope I didn't make a mistake or anything.
[21:04.37]How has it been 10 years and some of these guns are still not fixed?
[21:10.92]I mean, it's been 10 years and their game client has never been fixed.
[21:45.31]I was like AFK making a sandwich.
[21:54.09]Did she just try to 360 nosecoat me?
[22:01.38]My knife button's weird.
[22:02.20]I gotta change it.
[22:11.48]I'm just working on my sensitivity and then I'm
[22:14.20]ready you doki you guys get disconnected from the server we'll come back up I think
[22:45.55]Use your radar.
[22:46.07]This didn't work last time.
[22:47.85]That didn't work last time.
[22:51.46]What didn't work?
[22:54.64]Oh, my resolution.
[22:56.00]Oh, is it just mega fucked?
[23:02.09]Oh, fuck.
[23:02.59]I'm sorry about that.
[23:21.75]So what is Search and Destroy?
[23:23.43]How is it played?
[23:26.49]It's kind of like Valorant.
[23:28.77]All right.
[23:29.97]If you would explain a game mode to someone that's never played Valorant.
[23:34.84]so basically one team is defending a bomb site and then another team is trying to attack it okay and um the the team that's attacking has to plant the bomb and then if the bomb detonates they win the round and the defending team has to defuse the bomb so it's like counter strike oh yeah that honestly me that would have been such a better example and no no response yes uh yeah no response so you die you die okay until the next round
[24:13.72]Counter-Strike is Valorant.
[24:17.88]I have not played Valorant.
[24:19.92]I... I played Counter-Strike maybe a little... Why are you making fun of how I'm saying that?
[24:26.88]Valorant.
[24:28.25]What's wrong with that?
[24:29.87]Valorant.
[24:30.33]Alright, Kaylee, is it ready to go?
[24:33.35]Please tell me.
[24:35.49]Did I get the kill?
[24:36.09]That would have been funny on the screen.
[24:38.57]Sorry, is there any way that we can help?
[24:43.55]No, I got it.
[25:06.47]Alright so are we playing on Nuketown first?

[25:19.23]So, I mean, I've played once or twice.
[25:23.85]Like riding a bike.
[25:26.05]Wait, Dean, you definitely know what you're doing too, right?
[25:28.62]No, no.
[25:29.50]I missed like three times.
[25:31.54]Are you using the DSR-50 or the Ballista?
[25:34.08]It's one of the preset.
[25:36.64]You're using a preset?
[25:39.92]yeah it'll probably be I wasn't trying to use a sniper like during this situation yeah I'm not confident to use anything that requires any amount of skill to aim not now yeah that's uh it's honestly respectable I mean I'll go oh in 20 and be the embarrassment there's no like uh there's no like prize money or anything right I mean no I think it's just fun okay yeah yeah just making sure just
[26:06.46]it's bragging rights doesn't have to be for money it's for bragging rights come on oh I mean I already took a picture of me uh shooting symphony and killing him for myself you know my shot and just turned around I'm just I'm trying to pretend to be dead oh uh hello
[26:30.18]Just real quickly, we're just checking that everything's okay and does anybody need advice or help with anything?
[26:37.44]I think it's working for me.
[26:43.41]Yeah, my resolution's not wanting to do the thing.
[26:49.76]No worries.
[26:51.00]Do you want to... I'm not sure if we can, but... Did you want to put into the general voice channel?
[26:56.80]We'll try and get you to... Well, I think we're watching your stream, to be honest, so we could probably try and offer some help?
[27:03.18]I don't know if I want to stick with the screen resolution.
[27:08.94]Honestly, fuck it.
[27:12.43]I mean, it's fine, it's just I can count the pixels.
[27:18.34]I mean, if you want to spend two minutes with us to see if we can sort it, that's fine.
[27:24.53]We're happy to do that.
[27:25.65]Otherwise, if you're happy to play Minecraft on Black Ops 2, then fair enough.
[27:30.29]Yeah, you know, I really don't... Wait, I'm being told to change it to window borderless.
[27:34.95]Maybe it's... That's probably a good shout, isn't it?

[40:35.02]I got car.
[40:36.15]How did I not get the kill?
[40:37.29]I don't understand what the mathematical equation was.
[40:39.99]That's a big three!
[40:41.79]That's a big three!
[40:43.15]Oh, God.
[40:43.39]Oh, it's four!

[41:04.02]All right.
[41:07.20]He's inside the car.
[41:08.04]Son of a bitch.
[41:09.98]Oh, God.
[41:11.48]It's okay.
[41:11.98]We can get this still.
[41:17.64]I'll take it.
[41:18.39]Oh, fuck.
[41:18.91]I can't move.
[41:21.25]No, it's a stun grenade.
[41:23.45]I'm tired of getting stunned.
[41:26.24]Next point up?
[41:27.48]Shit, Germo, let's go!
[41:29.24]Germo, that's me!
[41:30.41]What, that's you?
[41:31.19]That's you?
[41:32.43]Oh, I thought that was a bad guy.
[41:34.07]Oh, they're all over that car, man.
[41:43.09]We'll even fuck out of it.
[41:45.43]I started so well, come on.
[41:49.22]They got two players playing across, one going into our spawn.
[41:52.80]Watch out.
[41:53.32]Oops.
[41:56.49]Alright, point.
[41:58.94]Yeah, we're back on point.
[42:00.30]Second floor.
[42:00.74]Second floor.
[42:01.18]Don't go 4-2 back because you're flipping spawns.
[42:11.32]Yeah.
[42:11.64]So if we contain mid control and just hold them out and spawn, we should be fine.
[42:19.24]Next point up soon.
[42:20.00]I couldn't see.
[42:22.88]There's some smoke.

[58:23.05]Like, you have to lock in and just be like... It's the only way you can play.
[58:31.87]You don't take... Uh-oh.
[58:33.85]Game crashed.
[58:40.15]Oh, hold on.
[58:43.38]Oh, crash.
[58:47.66]But you just have to sit there and be like, it's like you just see like the matrix symbols.
[58:59.97]Okay, I'm gonna open it back up.
[59:05.11]Yeah, the second you blink and call duty is when you're you're at the response screen.
[59:13.07]Stop, you're embarrassing this community.
[59:15.11]Nobody can hear me.
[59:15.85]It's just only you can hear me.
[59:16.87]I'm embarrassing myself in front of you guys.
[59:32.64]I like popped off in that first game, though.
[59:35.02]I did.
[59:36.56]I got to get that back, right?
[59:37.96]You got to get that COD mindset back.
[59:40.96]And it's called don't fucking throw grenades and walk into the room.
[59:46.19]Right?
[59:46.59]Like I've done that like three times.
[59:50.77]All right.
[60:02.42]I'm going to try this weapon.
[60:04.82]We're back in, right?
[60:06.90]We're back.
[60:22.85]Oh my god, I'm terrible.
[60:23.93]Maybe I should turn my sensitivity down.
[61:00.95]You guys remember when I hosted the 13 and 7 kill command gameplay in like 2013?
[61:05.55]Oh, I thought there was somebody lying there.
[61:14.67]Yeah.
[61:16.79]Yeah, I think I remember.
[61:18.50]Oh shit, sorry, I thought I was muted.
[61:21.14]Oh, no, no, you're fine.
[61:22.60]Oh, you were talking to chat.
[61:24.02]I was just talking to you.
[61:24.82]Okay.
[61:26.12]No, that's fine.
[61:26.92]I was just, uh, I was like, I don't, uh, it's a long time ago.
[61:33.19]So you play multiverses, right?
[61:35.55]Yeah, a little bit.
[61:36.13]I'm not great at it.
[61:37.45]Who do you play with?
[61:38.11]Oh, what's up?
[61:39.89]Who do you play with?
[61:41.39]Oh, uh, Shaggy.
[61:43.11]Kind of cool.
[61:44.89]Good pick.
[61:46.11]It's the only fighting game I've ever really gotten into.
[61:48.87]I feel like Smash was too complicated for me.
[61:52.58]Yeah, no, it kind of is a little too muddy.
[61:55.62]Too many particle effects too.
[62:00.64]I feel like there's a steeper curve when you first learn Smash kind of thing.
[62:05.94]There's also like 150 characters, right?
[62:09.22]So yeah, learning what every single person does is kind of hard when you, you know, there's like 80 characters.
[62:29.14]That was a lot of headshots and no kills.
[62:45.91]Switch the gun?
[62:47.63]Is this gun suck?
[62:49.21]Okay.
[62:50.62]Okay.
[62:54.77]Alright, this is chat makes my gun.
[62:57.63]Okay?
[62:58.19]Chat makes my gun.
[63:01.93]You've seen how I play.
[63:02.90]You've seen what I do.
[63:05.62]I need you guys to... I'm going to go class.
[63:10.14]Okay.
[63:10.90]Please help me.
[63:12.16]Please.
[63:12.40]Okay, we're going to go here.
[63:16.82]Let's just take this.
[63:17.76]What should I use?
[63:20.76]I'm seeing a lot of MP7, MP7, MP7.
[63:26.67]MP7.
[63:32.33]One's in the chat if you're MP7.
[63:35.47]Definitely what I think of, too.
[63:40.27]Or MSMC, I'm seeing a lot.
[63:42.07]You know, you're joking.
[63:43.97]MSMC?
[63:45.49]If it's from the back, it kind of reminds me of it, yeah.
[63:51.47]Okay, I've seen a lot of this.
[63:52.83]Okay, what attachments for the MSMC?
[63:55.35]Yeah, Jeremiah, you're almost ready.
[63:57.33]Are you doing some class?
[63:58.42]I'm just changing class.
[63:59.06]I'll be maybe two seconds.
[64:01.00]Okay, it's all good.
[64:01.62]Just whenever just whenever it is that you're ready, join the server and I'll know.
[64:04.76]Yep.
[64:05.10]To run it up.
[64:05.68]All right attachments.
[64:10.08]What am I putting on this long barrel?
[64:12.73]Okay.
[64:15.19]And laser laser and laser sight and long barrel.

[65:24.00]Okay.
[65:24.18]Let's go.
[65:24.42]All right.
[65:28.28]I'm coming back in.
[65:31.44]Chat has a good selection for me, I guess.
[65:38.61]Yeah, I mostly just left mine the same.
[65:40.25]I think.
[65:47.21]This thing's a piece of dog shit.
[65:48.59]Thanks, guys.
[65:51.01]Wait, what?
[65:51.85]Let me change one thing.
[65:53.37]What would they make you do?
[65:55.11]Tell me, can you just make... Okay, Sycuna, they said the M... What's this thing called?
[65:59.94]The MSMC?
[66:02.96]Yeah, that's a good gun.
[66:04.10]That's pretty good, isn't it?
[66:05.16]I think.
[66:06.86]With a long barrel and... Long barrel and laser sight.
[66:17.29]Long barrel and laser sight.
[66:27.57]Well, maybe I'll try that one, too.
[66:29.59]Ooh, all right.
[66:30.17]Yeah, I mean, if chat said it's good, it's got to be.
[66:35.83]I usually trust them.
[66:36.56]That's never wrong.
[66:38.90]It's got to be.
[66:39.50]I'm going to try it, too.
[66:40.66]Oh, God, these stuns, man.
[66:55.70]They last 10 years, I swear.
[67:13.55]Team, you guys good to go?
[67:15.83]Yep, I'm ready.
[67:16.45]I think so, yeah.
[67:17.05]All right, cool.
[67:22.42]Starting it up.
[67:33.39]Somebody said, why are there NFT ads on my stream?
[67:35.63]There aren't.
[67:35.95]What are you talking about?
[67:38.17]Right.
[67:38.97]If we hold mid, this is the easiest fucking win of our life.
[67:43.57]Alright, let's go for it.
[67:45.09]Let's get it.
[67:47.03]Mid control.
[67:49.69]Play your light.
[67:51.25]Name of the fucking game.
[67:52.23]Let's get it.
[67:52.67]If I die three times in a row, I'm changing back to my tried and true.
[67:58.43]Yeah, same, same.
[68:00.23]What are you guys rocking?
[68:01.81]We're both trying the MSC thing.
[68:04.29]Yeah, MSMC with long barrel and laser sight.
[68:07.71]I'm doing that early.
[68:09.97]84?
[68:09.99]89?
[68:10.82]94.
[68:10.92]Okay, so the laser sight, I'm assuming you don't scope in anymore?
[68:16.06]I don't know.
[68:22.06]Come on, baby.
[68:23.74]I want to get a fucking cross-map nade to set us off right, you know?
[68:27.40]You just throw the tomahawk.
[68:29.92]Throw it.
[68:30.90]Cross map.
[68:32.06]Me too.
[68:37.04]Is that mid cap first?
[68:42.00]Got traded.
[68:42.98]Holy fuck.
[68:46.98]Watch that left side.
[68:49.00]Naded.
[68:50.40]We got control left.
[68:51.80]I'm going mid here.
[68:52.46]I just couldn't see.
[68:54.28]One in the back.
[68:54.76]One in the back.
[68:55.18]One in the back.
[69:00.22]Nice.
[69:00.52]I feel like we flipped spawns, right?
[69:03.03]We flipped spawns.
[69:03.71]Yeah, we did.
[69:05.23]We did.
[69:05.81]I'm holding mid.
[69:09.19]Got one.
[69:18.08]Let me know if you guys need cover, right?
[69:19.34]Watch out.

[69:21.98]Got him.
[69:22.38]Good.

[70:51.35]I just watched you do that.
[70:52.17]I'm coming to help point.
[70:55.49]Oh, he's on point.

[71:08.64]Let's wait till we all respawn and make a push together.
[71:10.46]Alright, let's do this.
[71:12.72]We're grouped.
[71:13.86]Got one.

[71:22.53]Oh, no.
[71:24.19]Blau just teared us apart.
[71:27.25]Hardpoint switch going offline in 10.
[71:28.67]We play for the next one, which I think is mid.
[71:30.80]Let's just get mid control right now.
[71:32.98]Fuck this next point.

[75:34.96]Alright, next point coming up.
[75:36.74]Oh god, I just got lazed.
[75:38.12]There should be a mechanic shop on the left side of the... Yeah.
[75:44.19]God!
[75:46.87]Watch out behind us.
[75:49.89]I'm never inviting another fucking OTB member to this fucking match ever again.
[75:54.89]Oh my god.
[75:56.09]Going for the fucking content knives, dude.
[75:58.27]Fuck off.
[76:01.37]I don't care.
[76:01.87]I don't give a fuck.
[76:07.35]I couldn't even see where I was going.
[76:08.76]All the way in the back.
[76:09.98]I got sim.
[76:10.46]I got sim.
[76:11.16]It's fucking free.
[76:14.98]Go in.
[76:15.68]I don't know.
[76:16.38]Go in you dumb bitch.
[76:18.08]You fat ass character model.
[76:19.56]Oh my god.
[76:22.84]Why can't I go in there?
[76:24.54]It should be mid.
[76:25.78]Stop feeding.
[76:26.46]I can't help it.
[76:27.28]You just ran out and jumped straight in.
[76:32.06]Come on.
[76:36.49]So remember, this mode, it has no time limit.
[76:38.94]So we can still come back.
[76:42.72]Oh, fuck.
[76:43.24]Okay, next point.
[76:43.98]It's mid.
[76:44.32]Where?
[76:45.40]Mid, mid, mid, mid, mid.
[76:47.18]How did I not see him?
[76:48.52]I've got Metal Gear Solid NPC vision, apparently, in this game.
[76:52.13]Oh, Sim is going into mid right now.
[76:54.67]I'm holding right.
[76:55.35]Oh, God.
[76:55.67]He's ready.
[76:56.27]Nice, nice.
[76:57.67]Somebody's next to me.
[76:58.45]Oh, God.
[76:59.81]I got you with defense.
[77:00.47]I got you with defense.
[77:01.03]I got you with defense.
[77:01.64]Oh, God.
[77:01.88]I'm so stunned.
[77:02.52]I'm so stunned.
[77:03.24]I got you.
[77:03.56]I got you.
[77:03.84]I got you.
[77:04.97]I got you, baby.
[77:05.63]He's on the other side.
[77:06.21]Other side.
[77:08.61]What the fuck?
[77:10.35]He's on top.
[77:11.41]We fucking got this.
[77:12.21]Oh, my God.
[77:12.49]There's another one prone.
[77:14.93]It's okay.
[77:15.35]We got this.
[77:15.81]Our point.
[77:16.27]Our point.
[77:17.91]Yay.
[77:21.11]Oops.
[77:21.80]Why am I...
[77:27.95]Oh, nice, nice, nice.
[77:30.41]All right, all right.
[77:31.69]Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it.
[77:32.99]Next one, yeah.
[77:33.87]Yeah, next one comes up.
[77:34.69]We got to start defending for next one.
[77:38.11]I'm going for the next one right now, I think.
[77:40.23]Yeah, they're already rotating toward it.
[77:42.11]Oh, my gosh.
[77:43.21]It should be the back, right?
[77:43.99]It should be the back.
[77:44.47]I got it, I got it, yeah.
[77:47.43]I got it.
[77:48.31]Oh, fuck.
[77:50.44]They don't got stairs yet.
[77:51.52]They do not got stairs yet.
[77:53.30]Oh, no.
[77:53.70]There's somebody behind me.
[77:55.56]Gunning.
[77:58.69]I'm busting through.
[77:59.27]I'm busting through.
[78:00.41]No!
[78:03.15]Dude.
[78:03.81]Oh my god.
[78:06.47]I feel like it's so much closer than it is.
[78:08.56]It felt like it was pretty close.
[78:11.90]Nah, but like... No, it is.
[78:12.74]Bro, brother, look at the kills.
[78:20.77]Yeah, but I'm right there.
[78:21.95]I'm toe-to-toe.
[78:23.79]We got more kills than them total, I think, bro.
[78:27.16]They're fucking nice on objective play right now.
[78:29.64]Legit.
[78:30.00]I think we're actually... We have more kills total.
[78:32.56]Oh, yeah.
[78:32.98]You're right.
[78:33.28]You're right.
[78:36.26]That's what I'm saying.
[78:40.51]We're outfragging them.
[78:41.51]It's Symphony.
[78:42.45]Hard carry.
[78:45.62]Unbelievable.
[78:47.04]I'm gonna have Brooke, like, unplug the internet real quick.
[78:50.97]Have Symphony route through the VPN to, like, around, like, a circle around the globe, and then get back to here.
[78:59.85]Give Symphony, like, 400 ping.
[79:04.30]1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[79:06.52]Someone's changing their class.
[79:08.36]I'm gonna go yell at them.
[79:09.16]Feel free to come with me and talk shit.
[79:19.52]Hold on.
[79:20.92]What's up?
[79:21.46]I'm just adjusting.
[79:23.22]What's up?
[79:24.42]I'm just adjusting stuff.
[79:25.92]Wait, did you call me?
[79:28.08]Yeah, I called you.
[79:29.76]What the fuck?
[79:30.90]Hi, coach.
[79:31.36]How's it going?
[79:32.85]It's going awful.
[79:34.01]I don't like you.
[79:35.23]What's up?
[79:35.71]I do not like you.
[79:36.87]Wait, what did I do?
[79:40.14]What did I do?
[79:41.88]What the fuck?
[79:43.30]You got your little knife hiding in a little fucking corner?
[79:46.80]Dead.
[79:47.54]You don't like my jetball?
[79:50.26]Are you roleplaying as Jet in Call of Duty?
[79:53.01]What the fuck?
[79:54.31]And then I'm double smoking site and then I flash it and then I go in.
[79:57.15]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[79:59.73]I'm gonna blow up my house.
[80:02.59]I can't escape the Valor, man.
[80:03.71]I have an itch.
[80:04.59]Okay, it's not my fault.
[80:05.55]What the fuck?
[80:08.29]It's a problem, I know.
[80:09.21]I'm aware of it.
[80:09.83]Oh my god.
[80:11.15]This thing is jet.
[80:15.05]Hey, Sim.
[80:15.91]What's up, buddy?
[80:17.39]What's up, man?
[80:17.79]Yeah, you like that map a little bit more?
[80:19.31]Yeah, I started calling out, bro.
[80:21.43]You should have heard my call.
[80:23.21]No shot, man.
[80:24.96]It looks like I so badly want to participate in the trash talk, but I just don't know how.
[80:30.64]And I just want to be heard on everybody else's stream.
[80:34.46]You know what I mean?
[80:35.80]Like, what the fuck?
[80:36.98]It's me, Jerma, talking, by the way.
[80:38.08]It's Jerma985 talking.
[80:40.03]I just so badly want to be on other people's streams.
[80:42.05]That's what I'm doing.
[80:43.57]That's what that is.
[80:45.94]I just want to be heard on that stream.
[80:49.70]Alright, I'm going to get 20 kills next game.
[80:52.22]Just you watch.
[80:52.82]Just you watch.
[80:58.63]No, GG though.
[81:02.55]GG, dude.
[81:03.61]Next game.
[81:12.83]I think we're gonna do, um... We're gonna do S&D next map.
[81:17.31]That'll be interesting.
[81:18.58]That'll be really interesting.
[81:19.58]Yeah, I think S&D will be a lot of fun.
[81:24.20]Let's do this.
[81:26.42]I'm fucking muted guys relax as a joke
[82:01.18]I didn't do that.
[82:02.06]I've been muted almost the whole time.
[82:03.70]Don't you get it?
[82:04.16]No, I would never do that.
[82:08.09]That's so stupid and embarrassing.
[82:15.19]Why would I ever do that?
[82:18.21]I honestly, I'm going to sound like a fucking weirdo.
[82:21.16]I wouldn't do that for 10 grand.
[82:23.84]I don't think so.
[82:26.09]If it was like, hey, dude, Jerma, I'll give you $10,000 if you announce to all these streamers that, hey, just in case you guys want to know, I'm the sus guy.
[82:33.47]And like, don't make it a joke.
[82:35.15]I wouldn't do that for 10 grand.
[82:36.53]I wouldn't do it.
[82:38.69]Or I might.
[82:39.11]All right, we're going to run it up.
[82:45.29]Next one is SND, by the way.
[82:47.15]God.
[82:54.94]Can I change my loadout really quick?
[82:58.03]Hold up.
[82:58.69]Do it for free.
[82:59.55]One second.
[83:00.89]I thought this was Michael Myers.
[83:03.42]I thought that was Michael Myers.
[83:04.56]I was like, what the fuck is that?
[83:11.72]I don't know, but the more that I think about it, would I want to make all these other streamers think that I was like this fucking nerd?
[83:19.41]Like trying to be wicked funny.
[83:21.37]Like, shut up.
[83:22.57]Shut up, dude.
[83:23.12]Get out of the lobby.
[83:24.12]Fucking get out of here.
[83:25.22]I think I'm ready.
[83:38.93]Yeah, I think I'm good to go.
[83:40.67]You guys want to want to make it crazy.
[83:43.03]So this is search and destroy.
[83:46.17]Yes.
[83:47.50]And then so we're just doing something with the class and then we're running it.
[83:53.24]I'm done.
[83:53.72]I'm ready.
[83:55.44]I'm going to use the weapon I had before.
[83:56.99]I feel like I was better with it.
[83:59.07]It's going to be same same.
[84:01.56]I'm going to be honest, I switched to the same gun that Symphony uses in hopes of being almost as good as he is.
[84:08.84]Oh, and 94 is really good.
[84:12.82]I'm using it.
[84:13.56]Yeah, yeah, that's what it seems like.
[84:17.49]Guys, what does S&D matcher do, plaza or raid?
[84:21.37]Raid.
[84:24.08]Oh, I don't know.
[84:26.58]Paws is good, but it's just really big.
[84:29.10]Raid's a throwback.
[84:30.26]Raid's a throwback.
[84:30.92]Raid is a throwback.
[84:31.74]We'll see Raid S and D. All right.
[84:35.59]Got him.
[84:43.96]I feel like we're going to win this one.
[84:47.41]Yeah, surely we'll win this one.
[84:52.48]Surely.
[84:52.90]I think we're not putting up a bad fight.
[84:54.80]No, I don't think so.
[84:56.30]We can't win it.
[84:57.48]This game is fun.
[84:58.60]It really is.
[84:59.40]It is.
[85:00.34]It's just so hectic and fast.
[85:07.53]Here we go.
[85:10.49]So is this a big map, like long range or short range?
[85:12.45]Long range.
[85:14.54]Um...
[85:16.09]Now that I copied Symphony's gun, surely I'll be half as good.
[85:19.38]So is this it?
[85:20.66]They're going to fix it.
[85:26.54]Oh, okay.
[85:26.94]Yeah, they're going to fix it.
[85:28.87]Am I bugged?
[85:30.79]My scope doesn't work.
[85:31.67]Oh, yeah, because everyone's lagged.
[85:35.73]Yeah, I got higher sights.
[86:01.39]Say la la into the lobby.
[86:02.65]No, I wouldn't do that.
[86:03.33]10 grand.
[86:06.84]No.
[86:06.98]Is it up yet or is it just me?
[86:21.19]No, it's not up yet.
[86:21.91]They were starting the server, I think.
[86:31.76]So is this... So this is going to be Search and Destroy, right?
[86:37.21]Yes.
[86:37.57]So when you're dead, you're out.
[86:38.59]So we've got to play careful.
[86:40.43]Yep.
[86:40.99]Make sure you play really, really careful, Goku.
[86:46.03]Is that a Dragon Ball line?
[86:48.11]Yep.
[86:48.76]That's Mr. Satan.
[86:52.22]I'm not gonna lie, I've never watched Dragon Ball.
[86:54.58]Wait, what?
[86:54.94]No, no, no, no.
[86:55.94]Really?
[86:56.20]Never watched Dragon Ball.
[86:56.96]You're lying, you're lying.
[86:58.44]Not lying.
[86:59.78]Is that bad?
[87:00.92]I mean, it's bad.
[87:02.14]How old are you?
[87:07.28]23.
[87:07.30]23?
[87:08.06]Yep.
[87:09.11]By Dragon Ball, you mean like Dragon Ball Dragon Ball or anything?
[87:13.03]My parents should have had me earlier, bro.
[87:14.67]28, bro.
[87:15.03]Why the fuck did I have to give you 28?
[87:17.45]What the...
[87:19.81]Bro, what the fuck?
[87:22.01]That's 28?
[87:22.55]Bro, I thought you were 28, bro.
[87:24.84]Oh, man.
[87:26.42]Oh, shit.
[87:28.16]I looked like a boomer.
[87:29.32]I thought you were 28.
[87:37.28]It's fun.
[87:38.12]That's... How old do you think I am?
[87:40.48]28.
[87:40.50]25.
[87:41.36]Oh.
[87:41.48]Who's closer?
[87:48.21]You are both very far away.
[87:51.27]No way.
[87:52.27]Incredibly far away.
[87:53.24]18?
[87:53.30]No way.
[87:53.50]Way higher.
[87:53.76]Oh.
[87:53.84]38.
[87:53.86]A little bit lower.
[87:54.48]35.
[87:54.76]A little bit higher. 36?
[88:05.30]yep that's it wow I would not have guessed well I I mean yeah I didn't guess I don't I don't don't tell anybody that though like I don't know if you guys are streaming hopefully you're muted but like I don't I keep that I don't like blue no I say I'm like 32. I I've been I've been 32 for the last five years I feel like after a certain age it feels all about the same
[88:28.78]eating the same oatmeal, you know?
[88:30.80]After 30, it's just like, whatever.
[88:32.74]I always thought when I was like 25, 28, I was like, oh man, I don't want to turn 30.
[88:38.15]No, fuck.
[88:38.89]I'm going to be so old.
[88:40.19]Anyway, I dreaded it.
[88:42.63]Did you used to be a COD YouTuber?
[88:45.29]No.
[88:45.87]Why?
[88:46.09]I used to be a League of Legends YouTuber.
[88:48.29]Chat's lying.
[88:48.89]I just turned 29, bro.
[88:52.73]Yeah, don't worry.
[88:53.73]After 30, it doesn't matter.
[88:54.63]You don't care.
[88:54.95]I used to be a League of Legends YouTuber back in the day.
[88:59.56]Call of Duty?
[89:00.26]I mean, that's pretty different from COD.
[89:02.68]Yeah.
[89:02.92]I mean, I played it before, but I wasn't like a COD YouTuber, that's for sure.
[89:09.88]Alright, we're good to go.
[89:13.08]Am I in the game?
[89:16.85]Am I?
[89:17.53]Wait, are you?
[89:18.61]I was just spectating for some reason, I don't know why.
[89:27.41]SND, baby!
[89:31.14]Remember, the secondhand embarrassment is killing us.
[89:32.73]Stop.
[89:34.23]I'm muted nine out of ten times.
[89:36.49]We're just having a good time.
[89:38.27]Relax.
[89:40.37]Secondhand embarrassment.
[89:41.77]Hey, well, then good, because my tweet, that's what you're here for.
[89:46.36]Yeah, I mean, I've played the game before, and that's... And, like, not even a lot.
[89:50.96]Like, maybe once.
[89:52.00]That's about...
[89:54.50]As far as it goes.
[89:56.36]You're clapping them, though.
[89:57.34]You guys think I'm saying half of this stuff into the public lobby here?
[89:59.96]I think anyone who would call me a cocky YouTuber has got to be horribly confused.
[90:05.74]Gotcha.
[90:06.00]All right.
[90:06.82]Maybe we should split up where we defend.
[90:08.86]I'm thinking we would go like 2-2.
[90:11.98]2-A, 2-B, Dean and Sykuno-A.
[90:18.67]A, A, alright.
[90:19.79]A, B. Sounds good.
[90:23.35]Wait, this is like Valorant.
[90:25.77]Oh, B's your juice then, right?
[90:27.33]I think that's good for B. I hope.
[90:31.06]I'm pretty sure that's like long sights and shit.
[90:36.14]Let's hold the bombs down and let's fucking clap these kids.
[90:39.44]Yeah, I'm not afraid.
[90:41.78]I'm not afraid to take a stance.
[90:58.36]Oh, we have no one on B. We're heading over there.
[91:02.89]It's A, first floor.
[91:04.47]They're on B?
[91:05.17]B planning, yeah.
[91:06.45]Oh, I'm dead.
[91:07.51]Oh my god, they're on B. Oh, I just didn't get it.
[91:11.29]I've never played this game mode.
[91:14.53]All good.
[91:15.33]I just got shot from the second floor.
[91:17.03]Didn't even see him.
[91:19.33]I've literally never played Search and Destroy.
[91:21.25]Ever.
[91:24.05]Fuck.
[91:24.99]One inside of window B. Oh, just you.
[91:29.17]Yeah, I'm dead.
[91:30.46]Oh no.
[91:30.78]Turning corner with a grenade.
[91:37.72]My eyes closed.
[91:38.62]I think we're attacked now.
[91:41.20]I'm not going to lie.
[91:42.12]They're literally playing this like Valorant and not like S&D.
[91:46.82]I don't think I've ever had, I don't think I've ever played an S&D thing where people just instantly went and planted.
[91:54.87]Nah, we gave them B site though.
[91:58.13]We had no one there.
[92:01.08]Just thinking about them.
[92:02.84]I'm thinking we try to work A here.
[92:05.31]Do I have to?
[92:05.91]I think we just rush in.
[92:07.57]They're going to be holding this hard.
[92:09.15]Just rush in, guys.
[92:10.93]Just full speed blast kind of thing.
[92:16.28]One's on the rocks.
[92:20.52]I have mid control.
[92:21.22]Is that the running?
[92:23.04]Got one.
[92:37.15]Hold up.
[92:37.37]They gave me a lot of space here.

[95:24.76]I'll watch the A rotate.
[95:26.64]I like regenerate or something, right?
[95:28.20]I mean, I think.
[95:30.08]I'm scared.

[95:34.64]It's okay.
[95:35.76]I think we go bomb A. Go bomb A. Go bomb A now.
[95:38.71]Oh God, I'm dying, man.
[95:40.56]I'm dying.
[95:41.82]I just don't know where anybody could be.
[95:45.36]A game like this, you need to know where people can come from.
[95:48.90]And I just put a fucking bat on the ground.
[95:52.36]Put it on my head like this and just went in a circle.
[95:55.10]Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.
[95:57.06]Alright, where is he?
[95:58.54]Where's the bad guy?
[95:59.26]I don't see the A player.
[96:00.37]Let me step outside!
[96:02.75]Yeah, one left.
[96:04.21]Just send him.

[96:09.32]I'm sorry.
[96:09.74]I'm an idiot.
[96:13.16]Okay.
[96:16.84]It was the basketball court.
[96:19.42]Sykuno taking out Symphony.
[96:21.20]Oh, there it is.
[96:22.02]The 1v1 challenge.
[96:23.48]There it is.
[96:27.38]Isn't it so funny that they're not hearing me freak out every time?
[96:30.28]All they're hearing is like, let's go.
[96:31.74]Oh, sick.
[96:37.96]Keep this shit hot.
[96:42.06]I hear a lot of stuns A. Yeah, I'm looking.
[96:47.81]I'm here to help you defend.
[96:50.41]Let me know if you hear a push up.
[96:51.53]I'm going to watch mid still.
[96:54.20]They're smoking, probably planting B. It's a B rotate.
[96:57.82]Behind, behind, behind.
[96:58.46]In our spawn.
[97:09.69]That was weird.
[97:10.47]Fuck, man.
[97:12.95]Is there a head there, man?
[97:16.11]I just have no idea where people can come from.
[97:20.48]Don't look at your teammate.
[97:21.44]Guys, I don't know even where to walk.
[97:23.62]Fuck, man.
[97:35.12]Oh, shit.
[97:35.52]Who was next to site?

[97:44.81]There's three of them up.
[97:47.67]It's okay.
[97:51.41]We got this.
[97:52.69]Somebody said, what the fuck, Call of Duty?
[97:54.91]Ten-year-old Andy.
[97:57.33]I think it's first to six.
[97:59.66]Do you mean the game is ten years old, or do you mean you're calling me a ten-year-old?
[98:02.32]Because this game's fun.
[98:05.94]Go PK again.
[98:06.68]I got the bomb.
[98:11.82]Oh, two fucking peeking mid.
[98:16.77]One A window.

[98:38.61]I can't play.
[98:40.60]Why do you guys think I never played Counter-Strike?
[98:43.58]Ever.
[98:44.28]And Valorant?
[98:45.22]I won't even open it.
[98:47.06]Because it's like, I don't want to die.
[98:48.66]I don't want to die.
[98:49.10]I'm dead.
[98:49.46]Oh, Dean.

[100:33.54]I'm not a controller player!
[100:35.16]Somebody said, dude, you got famous on FPS games.
[100:38.40]This is like 12 years ago when people didn't even know how to tie their shoes in FPS games.
[100:44.20]Yeah, of course.
[100:46.24]I was fine back then.
[100:47.32]Hacker who?

[108:03.42]Mid car.
[108:03.82]Mid car.
[108:05.34]Trailer.
[108:08.94]We got two.
[108:09.48]We're up right now.
[108:11.50]Sim dead.
[108:12.04]I'm going for site.
[108:13.08]It's prone.
[108:13.50]Prone on car.
[108:13.98]Yeah.
[108:14.17]You got to watch that cross.
[108:15.31]Prone on the floor.
[108:24.80]I'm still alive!
[108:26.12]I'm not leaving!
[108:32.15]Don't push too hard.
[108:32.67]Don't push too far.
[108:34.21]Just holding this fence.
[108:40.03]I think it flipped.
[108:40.97]I think it flipped.
[108:42.33]Yeah.
[108:42.63]Yeah, it's flipped.
[108:46.29]No, it hasn't.
[108:47.21]Wait.
[108:47.39]No, no, no, no.
[108:51.43]Oh my goodness.
[108:57.83]I'm backing out of their spawn.
[108:58.95]Fuck.
[108:59.33]I think I fucked it.
[109:00.88]Not yet, actually.
[109:07.72]I'm on a fucking beamer, yo.
[109:12.88]One in mid.
[109:17.20]Fuck, dude!
[109:18.06]It's worth on me.
[109:19.88]Yeah, we're good.
[109:20.42]We're playing the objective real nice, man.
[109:24.07]Oh, I fell down a trip on something.
[109:25.87]He ran across.
[109:27.03]He ran across.
[109:27.55]He ran across.
[109:28.73]Got one on B. We're clear.
[109:32.63]We're clear.
[109:33.97]Got another one B. They're taking C. They're taking C. Flip it.
[109:37.25]Flip it.
[109:37.53]Flip it.
[109:37.91]Oh, got him.
[109:38.33]Fuck.
[109:41.27]Wait, they're still spawning A though?
[109:43.72]Yeah, sometimes it messes up.
[109:45.90]Yeah, that's real unlucky.
[109:47.82]I'm going to cap C. I'm going to cap C. Just play for B.
[109:56.58]Playing for C. Play for B still, even if you spawn A. Should be able to retake here.
[110:02.42]Okay, I'm in here.
[110:08.94]I'm in here, capping B. Try to take car.
[110:16.77]Holy fuck, man.
[110:21.65]One's dead in the truck.
[110:23.83]Got truck.
[110:26.75]Oh, I ran out of ammo.
[110:28.49]Oh god!
[110:29.27]I missed my smoke!
[110:36.67]Fuck the smoke.
[110:39.99]Going for cap.
[110:41.87]One's on... yeah, two.
[110:44.13]Shit!
[110:45.97]Threw that nade away.
[110:46.61]Alright, it's tied up right now.
[110:49.53]I got an extra point!
[110:52.03]Oh yes!
[110:52.55]You got it right at the end.
[110:53.56]Let's go!
[110:55.08]Come back, season.
[110:55.74]Close one!
[110:56.60]We actually won.
[111:05.43]Damn it.
[111:07.93]That was good.
[111:09.85]Yeah, we're up, we're up.
[111:12.37]Look at, look at, hit tab.
[111:13.59]We're out fucking fragging them.
[111:18.38]We are better mechanically.
[111:19.96]It's just the fucking truth.
[111:22.69]We do have mechanics.
[111:23.47]We do.
[111:23.71]Okay.
[111:23.89]There's two of them on site.
[111:24.85]Two of them on B. Two of them on B. Nading it.
[111:31.34]I'm pushing B. Pushing B. Get in there.
[111:32.78]Get in there.
[111:33.34]I killed them off of it.
[111:35.54]I killed them off of it.
[111:38.94]That was a big explosive.
[111:42.40]Whatever that was.
[111:42.90]He's in the corner.
[111:43.86]There's two in the corner.
[111:45.45]In B. In B. Hail Mary.
[111:50.73]Hail Mary.
[111:52.91]He's still on B. Let's go.
[111:56.23]Got him.
[111:56.53]Got him on B. In truck.
[111:59.63]Yeah, truck.
[112:00.83]Wait, he capped it?
[112:02.21]Oh, no way.
[112:03.19]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[112:03.89]He's always proning like near that fucking box, man.
[112:08.52]Oh, bro.
[112:08.82]Those stuns are next level.
[112:09.78]All right.
[112:10.06]We got to take car.
[112:10.80]If we push car, we have to angle on him.
[112:12.68]Oh, my God.
[112:13.60]Oh, my God.
[112:14.48]Push car for us.
[112:15.06]I got you.
[112:15.74]I got you.
[112:16.08]I got you.
[112:16.52]Okay.
[112:17.50]Let's slow down a little bit.
[112:19.36]They're making mistakes.
[112:20.08]They're pushing up.
[112:20.72]One on car, Dean.
[112:21.80]That fucking cheeky spot.
[112:25.24]Oh, there's another one.
[112:25.96]There was another one covering him.
[112:28.72]Alright, I gotta wait for you guys.
[112:29.89]It's too much.
[112:30.25]I'm pushing car again.
[112:34.03]Buddha is holding long.
[112:35.73]Oh my goodness.
[112:46.84]Ow, I shot him a million times.
[112:48.94]Where's my fucking sensitivity?
[112:51.71]Okay, I just got a knife.
[113:13.68]Oh, they have the angles.
[113:15.26]I can't even believe.
[113:17.82]I can't do anything.
[113:18.92]I need help on B. Coming.
[113:20.73]We can make this happen.
[113:21.77]We can make this happen right now.
[113:24.63]Got one.
[113:26.67]Got another mid.
[113:27.89]He's up in the window.
[113:29.39]Yeah, I'm on site.
[113:29.95]He's dead.
[113:31.35]We need B. I feel like I'm in times two speed.
[113:38.32]Oh, he's on site.
[113:39.62]I got him.
[113:39.98]I got him.
[113:46.17]Got another.
[113:48.03]Let's get this site.
[113:48.73]This is ours.
[113:49.45]Dean, prone, prone, prone.
[113:51.33]Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[113:55.98]We're doing good.
[113:57.94]We take this, we take this.
[113:59.92]I'm prone.
[114:00.56]Oh, no, I'm not.
[114:01.54]He's right behind the sign.
[114:02.48]He is like right behind the sign.
[114:05.50]What the fuck?
[114:09.59]There he goes.
[114:09.95]He's down, he's down, he's down.
[114:10.75]I'm prone, I'm prone.
[114:17.40]Oh god, Nate.
[114:18.54]Oh my god.
[114:21.02]On this next respawn, let's try all going left.
[114:23.10]Oh, what the fuck?
[114:27.20]Wait, what the fuck?
[114:28.04]How do I lower this?
[114:30.32]There you go.
[114:30.66]Let's all try taking left.
[114:32.82]Symphony's in our spawn being a fucking rat man.
[114:36.51]So is Blau.
[114:40.11]We're getting spawn caps so hard.
[114:41.49]Yeah, they're inside the house.
[114:47.52]You think they're close enough for us to flip, but we're not.
[114:52.56]No, they're holding it real good.
[114:59.12]Killed one.
[114:59.74]Killed three.
[115:00.27]Inside trailer.
[115:01.83]Trailer.
[115:02.05]Trailer.
[115:02.39]Trailer.
[115:03.31]Yeah, outside of trailer now.
[115:04.63]Dead.
[115:06.97]Oh, John, I forgot about you and the fact that you're only playing one fucking corner because you're a fucking bitch.
[115:11.83]I'm inside.
[115:20.46]Now the sensitivity is too low.
[115:22.94]Yo, yo, Psyche.
[115:23.60]Good push.
[115:24.14]Good push, Psyche.
[115:26.24]We're good.
[115:26.46]We're good.
[115:29.34]I'm getting B right now.
[115:30.26]I'm getting B. We got it.
[115:31.76]Let's hold it down.
[115:32.44]All right.
[115:32.98]Hold it.
[115:33.20]Hold it.
[115:33.40]Hold it.
[115:33.60]Hold it.
[115:44.29]Good shit, Germ.
[115:46.35]Where?
[115:46.69]Where they at?
[115:47.93]Where they at?
[115:50.01]Outside running out mid.
[115:53.37]Oh my god.
[115:54.61]I got trailer.
[115:55.71]I got trailer.
[116:04.49]Is it too late?
[116:05.15]Oh god.
[116:09.36]Oh god.
[116:10.62]Bro, they're on C. How?
[116:12.20]They're on C?
[116:12.92]Oh.
[116:20.03]Is there one more round or are we done?
[116:22.59]Like this?
[116:23.01]We lost this game?
[116:24.45]1-2 series.
[116:24.99]Yeah.
[116:25.91]Oh, bro.
[116:26.93]It was a good try.
[116:28.07]Good try.
[116:29.03]Fuck.
[116:36.60]It's a hard game.
[116:38.88]Yeah.
[116:39.72]Especially on Newtown.
[116:40.74]GG's though, guys.
[116:45.22]We did pretty decent-ish.
[116:50.92]All right, I'm going to go up to team one and shoot the shit with them.
[116:54.88]Yep.
[116:58.45]I think it crashed.
[117:00.87]No, that's fine.
[117:04.53]I have this problem with Call of Duty where I feel like I'm actually crashing.
[117:09.77]I feel like the game is in like times five speed sometimes.
[117:12.97]I feel like everything is like I have two times speed on a YouTube video.
[117:17.73]And I'm just like, where do I?
[117:18.91]I don't even know where my eyes are supposed to go.
[117:21.36]This way?
[117:21.87]Oh, oh, oh, oh!
[117:22.97]I'm dead.
[117:25.11]It's such a... Yeah, it's a crazy fucking game.
[117:29.58]Your sensitivity is 5x?
[117:31.36]I'm on 1.0 sensitivity.
[117:40.23]Yes, it was a lot of fun.
[117:41.69]Yeah, thanks for setting it up.
[117:42.97]That was fun.
[117:43.37]That was a blast.
[117:44.48]Yeah, that was really fun.
[117:46.54]I'm down for that.
[117:47.34]Good game.
[117:47.86]Yeah, let's do it again.
[117:48.54]It was really fun.
[117:49.58]I actually enjoyed it.
[117:50.48]Yeah, GG's, everybody.
[117:51.64]GG's.
[117:51.84]Thank you guys all for coming.
[117:53.68]I appreciate it.
[117:54.72]GG's.
[117:54.82]Thank you, everyone.
[117:56.38]Bye-bye.
[117:57.54]See you guys later.
[117:58.44]Let's be blessed.
[118:03.86]Shoot!
[118:05.48]I was a bottom fragger!
[118:14.29]No, that was fun.
[118:14.83]That was fun.
[118:16.43]I'm not a good Call of Duty player, but that was fun.
[118:19.51]Sometimes you gotta play COD.
[118:23.45]Do zombies?
[118:24.51]Can you do zombies through plutonium?
[118:28.57]No, I had fun.
[118:39.04]How do I do it?
[118:41.82]Yes, I can.
[118:42.34]How do you play zombies?
[118:44.61]Should I do it?
[118:52.80]Is there a different thing I have to do?
[118:55.64]Is it a different launcher?
[118:56.46]I've never played COD Zombies.
[119:03.23]I don't know how it works.
[119:06.51]Really?
[119:06.79]Can I just play it by myself?
[119:22.97]Oh, I did.
[119:23.93]When did I play?
[119:25.67]Oh, that didn't work.
[119:27.49]That was a hard crash when I tried to open zombies.
[119:36.30]Good job interacting with others.
[119:37.36]We're proud of you.
[119:39.46]Hope it was entertaining.
[119:41.14]I had fun.
[119:42.82]The first game I got a bunch of kills.
[119:51.23]I just get so flustered.
[119:53.85]You know what?
[119:56.73]I need a seatbelt.
[119:58.11]I need a seatbelt on this chair.
[120:00.47]You know what I mean?
[120:01.11]I need a seatbelt and straps here on my elbows to keep me here.
[120:05.88]Because every time I go to shoot and I miss, I start moving and jumping around and shaking my head.
[120:12.76]I need a seatbelt to make it so I can't do that.
[120:18.00]No, a seatbelt, like you're in a roller coaster.
[120:23.26]Can you imagine if I had like a thing over my shoulders?
[120:26.97]That'd be so stupid.
[120:33.97]I can't open, I can't open zombies.
[120:40.08]I just like...
[120:45.97]You should play Mortuary Assistant.
[120:48.09]Should I just go to Mortuary Assistant?
[120:50.10]How long is it?
[120:50.76]I don't know how long I'm going to stream for.
[120:52.00]Should we just do it?
[120:59.24]Yes.
[120:59.54]It's only a couple hours?
[121:00.66]Is it only a couple hours?
[121:10.28]It's like an hour or two?
[121:11.40]Alright, yeah, let's do it.
[121:12.29]Let's go.
