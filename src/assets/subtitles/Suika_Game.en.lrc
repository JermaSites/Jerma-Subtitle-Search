[00:17.50]Hey, what's up?
[00:18.92]How's it going?
[00:23.50]Welcome to my live stream.
[00:30.01]Last time you saw me was.
[00:31.51]I don't know.
[00:36.25]October.
[00:39.17]6th or something.
[00:40.35]How's it going?
[00:44.31]Good to see you again.
[00:45.03]I thought you retired.
[00:48.38]Doesn't mean I can't play Suica game for a few hours and hang out and talk.
[00:54.61]But I can't do that?
[00:59.27]Are we doing well?
[01:01.47]So hey, let's talk about TwitchCon.
[01:03.85]Man, that was a lot of fun.
[01:05.58]I'm gonna go over TwitchCon and like all the things that I just did.
[01:08.12]Not like it's been three weeks.
[01:15.49]Yeah, I feel better.
[01:16.09]I have one problem.
[01:17.81]Yeah, so I went to TwitchCon.
[01:19.80]If you watched Austin Show's Name Your Price, I was on it.
[01:22.46]It was a lot of fun.
[01:23.82]It was awesome to see a lot of people.
[01:26.00]Great that it was in Vegas.
[01:27.74]Because I didn't really have to go anywhere.
[01:31.20]But, unfortunately, I got the sickest I think I've been in the last at least couple of years.
[01:38.01]Had a congested head and couldn't breathe through my nose for about a week.
[01:46.76]It was really annoying.
[01:49.04]But as of the last few days, I've been a little better.
[01:51.06]Feeling good.
[01:53.36]Feeling good enough.
[01:53.92]I feel like I'm pretty much over it now.
[01:56.88]There's one problem.
[01:59.04]I have white noise in my head now.
[02:02.99]And I looked it up and it's like, yeah, that can kind of happen for, you know, a week or so after.
[02:06.75]And it's like, oh my, great.
[02:08.07]That's fantastic.
[02:12.61]My left ear is just like... It sounds like an old TV is still on.
[02:19.57]Just on the left side of my head.
[02:24.64]So that's fun.
[02:26.56]Hoping that goes away in the next week.
[02:33.38]Have you seen the Five Nights at Freddy's movie?
[02:37.22]No.
[02:37.40]No.
[02:40.21]Guys, let me tell you, I got a movie story for you.
[02:42.85]It's been a while.
[02:43.82]I've got stories.
[02:46.22]Uh...
[02:50.27]Alright.
[02:50.47]How do I even begin this?
[02:52.11]Like you don't, it doesn't, this, it doesn't matter where or why this happened to just know I've been sick.
[02:58.93]And, uh, you, when you rent a movie on, I think I've rented it on iTunes.
[03:08.74]I was like on iTunes, like, oh yeah, I'll rent this movie on iTunes.
[03:11.69]You have 48 hours to watch a movie.
[03:15.19]And I I don't even know why I did this, but I rented the game.
[03:21.34]Which is it's it's a older movie.
[03:23.56]It's got like Sean Penn and.
[03:27.12]And the movies from like 19 like I don't like 1998 or something.
[03:34.18]So I I tried to watch this movie.
[03:38.52]Two straight like three, four straight times and I fell asleep within 10 minutes every time.
[03:44.32]The last time I tried, I had five hours remaining to watch it.
[03:50.34]I had five hours remaining.
[03:51.50]I was like, shit, this movie's two hours long.
[03:54.24]I have to, I need to watch this movie.
[03:56.38]Don't fucking fall asleep.
[03:59.00]I got 15 minutes in, fell asleep, and when I woke up, the climax ending of the movie was happening.
[04:08.08]I may as well have just read the Wikipedia article.
[04:11.58]Like I got the big moment.
[04:13.34]If you've never seen the game, I'm not going to spoil it because whatever, it's a big movie and it's very interesting, whatever.
[04:20.55]I woke up at the very moment that the actual like, hey, this is what the fucking whole movie is.
[04:26.97]And I said immediately, I should have just read the fucking Wikipedia article.
[04:31.11]I should have just read the Wikipedia article.
[04:35.31]That was fun.
[04:37.59]What movie was it?
[04:39.09]The Game.
[04:42.97]You skipped the cutscene.
[04:44.25]Yeah, that's actually what I did.
[04:51.52]I skipped the cutscene in the cutscene.
[04:54.88]That's so dumb.
[04:57.44]Well, it was a pretty interesting movie.
[05:00.80]You know what else I saw?
[05:01.58]Ooh, boy, and this was a good one.
[05:05.25]I watched Saw 10.
[05:08.75]Loved it.
[05:10.45]Loved it, by the way.
[05:14.07]Yep.
[05:15.95]I don't want to say anything, but holy shit.
[05:19.07]I love that movie for a million different reasons.
[05:27.58]Saw X, whatever you want to call it.
[05:30.54]Yeah, Michael Douglas is in that movie, yeah.
[05:34.30]No, no, no, he's not in Saw.
[05:35.85]He's in the game.
[05:40.43]That's it.
[05:46.84]Did you smell the smell he smelled?
[05:50.42]No, Michael Douglas is not in... No, it's two different movies we're talking about.
[05:56.40]But no, I did not see the Five Nights at Freddy's movie.
[06:00.13]I told you the only time I'm going to watch Five Nights at Freddy's is when it's on DVD or whatever streaming software, it doesn't matter.
[06:09.76]And I'm going to put it in times 10 speed.
[06:14.40]That's how I'm going to watch it.
[06:16.98]It's already on Peacock.
[06:20.46]Who's... I'm sorry, my opinion.
[06:23.26]Who's getting Peacock?
[06:24.69]I'm just... I don't... Like, what do you mean?
[06:26.47]Peacock.
[06:29.81]Peacock?
[06:32.21]You know what's really annoying?
[06:34.49]This just turned back into cable television.
[06:38.09]Peacock.
[06:38.77]Hulu.
[06:39.41]Apple TV+.
[06:41.06]Netflix.
[06:41.86]HBO Max.
[06:42.86]Like... There's so many of these now.
[06:52.32]But yeah.
[06:57.18]Watch it on stream.
[07:00.33]I'm... I'm not going to jail to watch the Five Nights at Freddy's movie, okay?
[07:05.59]With you guys on stream here.
[07:12.13]Wait, what was the movie?
[07:17.18]Is that what you wanted me to watch?
[07:18.78]I forgot.
[07:19.54]I'm still kind of sick.
[07:24.09]That's just how much I do not care about the Five Nights at Freddy's movie.
[07:27.17]I forgot that was the, I forgot that was the movie we were talking about.
[07:30.02]I was just like, I don't even care.
[07:33.26]Is it actually on Peacock though?
[07:34.86]That's kind of, that's kind of hog jam.
[07:37.42]I don't say fuck you.
[07:41.69]I don't want to, I don't want to watch Five Nights at Freddy's.
[07:45.43]I didn't even want to play Five Nights at Freddy's.
[07:48.29]I just saw the algorithm and I was like, you know what?
[07:50.27]That's going to get me fucking clicks.
[07:58.55]Hey, one person laughed at that.
[07:59.83]I'm cool.
[08:03.28]Based.
[08:07.84]What about the Smurfs?
[08:08.74]No, I still haven't seen the Smurfs, unfortunately.
[08:11.48]That's not even unfortunately.
[08:12.60]Who cares?
[08:16.73]Let me ask a real question, though, to all of you.
[08:18.51]And hold on.
[08:20.17]Music's not too loud.
[08:20.97]It kind of is.
[08:21.35]Alright, we're going to turn it down for this.
[08:25.85]Okay, I know that Five Nights at Freddy's is super important.
[08:31.29]It's really important to a lot of you.
[08:34.15]I'm imagining if I was a huge fan of a game or a series and they came out with a movie, it would be like, okay, did they screw this up or not?
[08:42.32]I want to hear from a lot of you.
[08:44.86]Did they do a good job?
[08:47.24]Is it like, okay, that's a good Five Nights at Freddy's movie.
[08:49.50]They did it justice.
[08:52.80]Can I get a poll and chat?
[08:56.10]There's no, I'm not going to make it so you can put anything less than a six, because I know a ton of you are going to give it a one because I don't know, you know, you know how it is.
[09:04.96]So let's say, let's say six through nine, six through 9.5, because how dare you give anything a 10?
[09:18.34]Sorry, what's the poll say?
[09:20.07]It's just, it's just yes, no, and I didn't watch it.
[09:22.79]That works too.
[09:23.37]That's fine.
[09:26.13]Looks like you guys think it was pretty good.
[09:28.57]You guys seem to like it.
[09:32.23]It did it justice.
[09:33.39]It was just bad.
[09:34.11]Wow, a lot of you didn't watch it.
[09:44.40]I liked Borat better.
[09:47.12]Did Borat come out with a new movie?
[09:50.50]Or do you just like Borat the franchise more than Five Nights at Freddy's?
[10:02.47]Yeah, dude, Borat 3 is out.
[10:04.23]What?
[10:04.47]I think you're lying to me.
[10:12.16]Wow.
[10:15.14]Half of... That's... I'm surprised by that.
[10:19.71]All jokes aside, I probably will watch it at some point.
[10:21.85]But I don't know.
[10:22.73]When it's... Maybe when it... Maybe I'll rent it.
[10:28.67]Anyways...
[10:34.23]We're going to play this Suica game.
[10:35.39]We're just going to hang out for a little bit.
[10:38.31]I wanted to go live because I felt a little bit better, and it's been a while.
[10:43.39]And I get to talk about something else too.
[10:46.43]This weekend, on Sunday, at 1 p.m.
[10:51.43]Pacific, I am going to implore that all of you go watch Doug Doug's livestream.
[11:01.47]Doug Doug is doing a show called Shuffle Mania.
[11:05.89]And I had a lot to do with it.
[11:10.99]It's the first real project that I spent a lot of time on for off-brand.
[11:16.62]So it's good.
[11:18.30]Just telling you.
[11:20.80]Just telling you to go check it out.
[11:22.18]1 p.m.
[11:23.84]Sunday on Doug Doug's channel.
[11:28.99]I've done other stuff with off-brand, but this is the first time when I've really, really sat down and worked pretty extensively with the person coming to off-brand.
[11:44.40]It's just DougDoug.
[11:45.98]DougDoug's awesome.
[11:48.14]I hung out with DougDoug at TwitchCon and it's great.
[11:51.86]It was really, really wonderful.
[11:55.02]I saw a lot of people at TwitchCon.
[11:58.94]You guys are going to think I'm crazy, but over the last, I want to say like two or three months, I've tried to get a little bit more active and I started playing tennis and you would not believe how fucking impossible it is to find anyone to play this game.
[12:26.17]like talking to people about this I'm the annoying tennis guy not Mario tennis no I've been bringing it up is that who because it's impossible to find anybody to play with I used twitchcon as like a hey yeah what's going on how are you um you are you you you played you I mean you play tennis
[12:55.73]And it's a shitload of... No.
[12:57.93]No.
[12:58.51]No.
[12:59.71]So.
[13:02.73]I don't think... It's gonna be hard.
[13:05.21]Just join a club?
[13:06.12]Yeah, that's the idea.
[13:08.26]Maybe eventually.
[13:16.00]You're in the wrong crowd.
[13:23.53]Going to the gamer convention and trying to excite people about tennis.
[13:29.04]Yeah, I'm 40.
[13:30.74]And I'm starting to really understand that.
[13:42.36]These are gamers.
[13:44.44]There were a few people that were into it.
[13:48.20]Even if they were pretending to be into it to make me stop talking about it.
[13:58.46]How old are you, really?
[13:59.18]38.
[13:59.28]I just, look, I always just, I just say that I get ready for the next year.
[14:07.47]I just like, oh, I'm 39.
[14:08.59]I'm 39 years old.
[14:10.71]I just say that so when it actually comes around in a year, it's like, yeah, that's fine.
[14:14.71]I'm good.
[14:15.15]I'm cool.
[14:19.38]I prepare myself for a full year.
[14:25.52]Bro, you're ancient.
[14:28.55]Dude, why do you think we're about to just play, like, Suica game for two hours?
[14:35.23]It's not even ancient.
[14:40.02]It's still young.
[14:40.68]You're not even in chapter three out of five yet.
[14:45.38]Exactly.
[14:53.37]I can't even finish Stranglethorn Vale yet.
[14:56.07]So... Got plenty of time.
[14:58.15]I made that joke, like, nine years ago.
[15:01.87]Yeah, exactly eight years ago, I made the... Oh, hey, I'm 30.
[15:06.12]That's not even that old.
[15:07.18]I'm still in a bunch of greens.
[15:09.44]And it was wicked funny.
[15:10.50]Alright, you guys ready to just hang on and play?
[15:13.92]Okay.
[15:20.63]What is this?
[15:21.11]You should do a poll to see who wants you to do five minutes of stand-up.
[15:26.03]I feel like I've just done 15 minutes of stand-up.
[15:30.37]I feel like that's what this is.
[15:33.65]Isn't this just like open mic stand-up comedy for like four or five hours every time I go live and I just try new material on you and you just boo or you say like that was kind of funny.
[15:43.86]I think that's kind of how it is.
[15:51.45]That's the whole point, yeah.
[15:53.41]Dude, you've bombed.
[15:56.19]Alright, I don't have a single recorded game of... Is it Suica?
[16:03.03]Suica?
[16:03.37]How do I say this?
[16:04.27]Am I pronouncing this right?
[16:06.61]Suica?
[16:08.03]How do I say this?
[16:10.05]I've seen a ton of people play it, and I'm the iPad gamer, and this is one of those games that I would play in bed for four hours.
[16:16.89]This is the kind of game that I would play in bed.
[16:20.81]And I would fall asleep playing this game and the switch would fall down and hit me in the mouth.
[16:27.26]Or I catch it in the last second right before it is about to touch my lip.
[16:30.92]Because I have incredible reflexes like I'm sure a lot of you do.
[16:35.17]I also, I've heard the music of this game and I think it's, we probably should have, you know, Donkey Kong Country.
[16:43.77]OST.
[16:44.09]I didn't think I had it ready.
[16:46.89]Is that a good volume or what?
[16:54.18]Should I play with the Halloween mode?
[16:58.98]I feel so bad about Halloween too.
[17:00.87]It sucks.
[17:01.37]I was going to do a... I don't even want to tell you what I was going to do.
[17:06.69]Because if I tell you what I was going to do, then I can't ever do it.
[17:12.82]And you can't do a Halloween joke on November 9th.
[17:17.87]November 10th.
[17:19.73]They've already started playing Christmas.
[17:20.89]Guys, they started playing Christmas music after the last trick-or-treater left.
[17:25.23]Okay?
[17:26.97]It's over.
[17:27.81]Alright, so if you don't know about this game, I'll tell you about it.
[17:34.74]Okay, go ahead.
[17:37.14]So this is a game where you drop fruits.
[17:41.02]And when you drop a fruit down...
[17:43.54]Like, for instance, right here.
[17:45.60]It sits there.
[17:46.94]On the right... You've all... Everybody knows how to do this.
[17:50.93]I don't have to... Why do I have to explain this?
[17:53.39]You guys have probably been watching people freak out over this game for the last, like, two weeks.
[18:01.89]Please explain it.
[18:02.53]I don't know.
[18:03.03]Okay.
[18:03.81]So you have to combine fruits.
[18:05.83]And if you take a look at the legend over there on the right, two grapes makes a... I don't know what that is.
[18:14.57]I'm going to call that a seashell because I don't know what kind of fruit that is.
[18:21.64]Two seashells makes an orange.
[18:25.34]That was a pretty good start, by the way.
[18:26.60]Did you just hear that gulp?
[18:30.70]The microphone's pretty close to my face.
[18:31.95]You probably did hear it.
[18:34.67]Two oranges makes a tomato and two tomatoes makes a lemon.
[18:38.69]Two lemons makes a skinless fruit.
[18:43.01]Two skinless fruits makes a pineapple.
[18:44.53]Two pineapples makes a grenade and two grenades makes a pumpkin.
[18:47.54]So there you go.
[18:51.46]It's a lemon.
[18:52.94]I don't care.
[18:54.78]And the goal is to get as high as you possibly can.
[18:58.04]Everything gets larger.
[19:01.62]So let's do it.
[19:03.90]I've seen so many rage compilations of this game.
[19:06.44]Alright.
[19:09.86]So the apples are here.
[19:12.44]Alright.
[19:13.00]There's definitely a strategy with this.
[19:14.96]And I know that people are going to be mad at me, but I don't care.
[19:17.18]I don't have a strategy.
[19:21.43]Is the music good?
[19:25.21]No one has ever seen this game before.
[19:29.17]Never.
[19:30.09]I'm the first one.
[19:34.00]Alright, I'm gonna... I gotta figure... I gotta get good at this.
[19:38.24]So other streamers can come look at my score and go, What?
[19:41.40]How did he... How did he do that?
[19:44.50]And they rage and they have to try to beat mine.
[19:46.76]I'm gonna put this... Well, that was... Hold on.
[19:49.49]Oh, they have to touch, by the way.
[19:50.79]So this is actually pretty good.
[19:51.67]Because if I do this now... Boom.
[19:54.23]Alright, I've got a lemon.
[19:54.99]Hmm.
[20:02.65]Alright, so you can see what's next on the top, right?
[20:04.31]So the next is strawberry.
[20:05.65]You know, whatever.
[20:11.86]Oops.
[20:18.30]Actually, that should be alright.
[20:19.03]Should be alright.
[20:27.18]It feels weird to hear Donkey Kong music doing this.
[20:29.20]I feel like something's wrong.
[20:31.77]It's already over?
[20:32.53]Well, I thought you'd never seen this game before.
[20:38.65]I always play games way too late.
[20:42.35]You see, if I had played this game two weeks ago, when everybody else had no idea what they were doing, then this would be completely fine.
[20:54.70]But now everybody has like the super insane strategy to make sure you get to 1000 points in 10 seconds.
[21:01.31]I'm always like three weeks too late.
[21:05.35]Oh, there's also WarioWare too that I want to play.
[21:07.68]So we're doing this.
[21:16.76]Oh, everyone's pogchamping.
[21:18.15]I thought you were pogchamping what I just did.
[21:19.79]I was like, did I do something good?
[21:26.91]No, I need to turn the music up for me.
[21:29.33]There we go.
[21:32.23]This is my first round ever.
[21:35.64]Look at that.
[21:37.34]This stuff is going well.
[21:38.56]Do you think we'll get to a pineapple?
[21:47.95]You're bad, that's fine.
[21:52.76]Cool.
[21:53.00]Let's combine this.
[21:55.28]Alright.
[21:55.52]Now, what's coming up next?
[21:56.65]Alright.
[21:56.95]Let's get this over here.
[21:57.61]Going right here.
[22:00.33]Because then that'll be... Wait.
[22:02.71]Grape is up next.
[22:05.83]Boom.
[22:06.55]Okay.
[22:07.07]I got to get this over here.
[22:09.02]Oh, I think this might be... I might be in trouble.
[22:12.26]I got 194 points.
[22:13.30]Is that good?
[22:19.14]That's like a lot, isn't it?
[22:22.97]I know it's like, it's like, it's 2000 is like considered even remotely okay, right?
[22:34.60]Keep dreaming.
[22:36.14]That's it.
[22:36.72]Alright.
[22:37.40]Hold on.
[22:43.00]I swear I'm like not sick anymore.
[22:44.95]Alright.
[22:47.79]If I can make a
[22:50.29]Alright, this is actually is OK.
[22:51.39]Because now I just need to bring... Alright, if this fits right here, then I'm good.
[22:57.62]Will this fit right here?
[23:00.34]Good.
[23:00.96]OK, this is perfect.
[23:01.52]I got it.
[23:01.90]I got it.
[23:02.30]I got it.
[23:02.58]I got it.
[23:02.83]I got it.
[23:06.15]So now I'm going to upgrade that.
[23:07.25]It's going to go boom, boom, boom.
[23:08.41]It's going to upgrade the lemon on the left.
[23:09.59]I don't know where to put this though.
[23:24.19]Is that stupid?
[23:24.71]Alright, here we go.
[23:25.43]This is gonna be good.
[23:25.97]Watch this.
[23:26.29]Ready?
[23:29.83]Good.
[23:30.37]Now we just... Why is it not moving?
[23:33.55]It needs to go to the right a little.
[23:35.19]How do I move it?
[23:36.05]Why is this not doing this?
[23:41.66]I think I'm gonna save... Uh-oh.
[23:45.76]a fruit on it I don't want to put a big one on it because I think it'll screw it up I think I have to put like a little one there I just put like a what's up next I'll put this over here oh that's okay it's alright I'm I'm still okay
[24:14.90]Will you just touch?
[24:16.74]Oh, I did it.
[24:17.20]I did it.
[24:17.44]I did it.
[24:17.68]I did it.
[24:17.86]I got it.
[24:18.10]I got it.
[24:21.04]There it is.
[24:21.32]There it is.
[24:21.56]There it is.
[24:21.82]Watch this.
[24:22.10]Watch this game.
[24:22.60]I'm mostly, I'm mostly, I'm going to, you know what I mean?
[24:26.04]I'm going to sit right here.
[24:26.88]Watch this.
[24:27.20]He's going to touch.
[24:29.56]It's going to take another minute.
[24:31.81]Should I remove the grape in the middle?
[24:33.91]Or is that stupid?
[24:40.67]If I hit the grape in the middle, won't it?
[24:43.23]I think it'll spread it out too much.
[24:47.69]I think I have to move it over.
[24:48.57]I think I have to put it here.
[24:52.96]This looks correct to me.
[24:58.30]Come on, there goes.
[25:00.44]Do it.
[25:02.72]Yes, OK, I got a I got a pineapple.
[25:06.64]Now I have to take a second because.
[25:07.96]I have an opportunity to clear out some of the bottom.
[25:19.01]It's at this moment where a lot of you that know what you're doing know what to do, but I'm just, you know what, let's just go.
[25:27.18]Um, I could, hmm.
[25:33.04]Really?
[25:33.66]It's okay.
[25:34.10]Can I sneak this right down the middle here?
[25:38.26]Maybe.
[25:40.60]Oh, shit.
[25:41.70]Sorry.
[25:56.22]Am I doing okay?
[25:59.64]Oh, God damn it.
[26:00.56]That's not good.
[26:01.55]Uh oh.
[26:03.61]They might touch though.
[26:04.79]There we go.
[26:05.41]Okay, now... Okay, that is doing fine over there.
[26:17.05]Because I'm going to get... That'll turn into a peach.
[26:22.11]But I don't know what to do.
[26:22.81]What do I do with this strawberry?
[26:27.34]I don't know.
[26:34.45]Okay, let me get this over here.
[26:36.85]Don't bounce.
[26:38.05]Stay right there.
[26:38.51]Alright, here we go.
[26:43.13]Nice.
[26:43.71]Boom, boom, boom.
[26:44.93]There it is.
[26:45.45]Alright.
[26:46.13]Grapes in the bottom I'm going to hit.
[26:49.57]Now... Okay.
[26:54.15]I don't think this is too bad right now.
[26:58.46]That'll hit eventually.
[27:04.69]He's cooking.
[27:11.01]Maybe a little.
[27:11.59]I'm afraid to do anything.
[27:12.50]I try to sneak this in here.
[27:16.22]That was great.
[27:19.22]Alright, this has to go down here.
[27:20.44]Okay.
[27:23.47]Okay.
[27:26.47]I'm not even gonna think about it.
[27:27.35]I'm just gonna do what I think is correct.
[27:32.67]Okay.
[27:36.47]Oh shit.
[27:37.39]I should have looked.
[27:38.96]But it's okay because I'm gonna do this.
[27:43.28]I gotta sneak this in here.
[27:46.52]Damn it.
[27:49.70]Not bad.
[27:53.29]You have to think.
[27:53.85]Alright, if I get more than 1,000 points in my first game ever, then you owe me a I am so sorry that I ever doubted you.
[28:03.13]If you get 1,000 points in Suica in your first game.
[28:09.01]Is that cool?
[28:11.26]This game's addicting.
[28:22.64]You can get 1k if you just spam.
[28:24.90]Really?
[28:25.20]We're gonna try that next.
[28:29.29]I think I'm building a pretty decent... I almost said portfolio.
[28:34.25]No!
[28:34.57]Alright, no, no, no, I can fix it.
[28:37.61]I think this is fixable.
[28:38.53]Shit.
[28:44.61]Uh-oh.
[28:46.61]Indeed, uh...
[28:50.74]Yeah, my Suica portfolio.
[28:55.55]That's the kind of shit that is in like a dumb comedy show where it's like the baby is in a suit.
[29:03.59]And there's a joke of, oh, here, take a look at my portfolio.
[29:06.04]And it's like the Suica score.
[29:08.00]There's a joke in there somewhere.
[29:15.90]Oh, shit, I fucked it up.
[29:21.76]Do it.
[29:23.48]How is that not touching on the right?
[29:25.88]That is literally touching right now.
[29:27.58]It just clipped into it.
[29:28.80]Okay.
[29:38.39]I don't hate what I'm doing right now.
[29:48.29]Because if I can, alright, if I can do, this should be alright.
[29:53.43]Ready?
[29:55.59]Touch.
[29:58.47]Oh, yes.
[29:59.77]Do it.
[30:06.97]Everybody thought I wasn't going to get at least three of these bigger ones.
[30:13.09]If you thought that, you're stupid.
[30:20.95]Okay, there we go.
[30:29.18]Alright, the next time, my next round, I'm going to make sure that the bottom row is clear, no matter what.
[30:38.70]Why is he mean today?
[30:39.98]What?
[30:45.78]Put that here.
[30:48.76]Shit.
[30:50.87]It's actually not bad.
[31:00.38]That might have been dumb, but maybe not.
[31:03.68]Was that not stupid?
[31:07.16]Alright, which one of these do I want to make into a... This one here, right?
[31:11.10]Because then... Touch!
[31:15.69]Touch!
[31:17.39]Touch!
[31:20.12]No, it's the worst thing I could have done.
[31:25.28]Alright, this is huge.
[31:26.18]This is huge.
[31:27.28]This is absolutely enormous.
[31:28.94]This is massive.
[31:30.48]I just can't screw this up.
[31:31.44]I have to move this because then I'll get a grenade.
[31:36.60]I don't know what to do.
[31:37.14]I don't know what to do.
[31:37.90]I don't know what to do.
[31:39.56]I've never been this far.
[31:44.64]I need to get rid of that.
[31:48.46]I don't know where to put this.
[31:50.17]Because everywhere I put this is going to be wrong to at least two or three hundred people here.
[32:03.01]Shit.
[32:03.45]I don't know what to do.
[32:06.99]Should I just keep doing this?
[32:09.88]And then it's going to erupt.
[32:12.00]That was really stupid.
[32:16.54]How did I miss?
[32:18.97]How did that?
[32:19.53]What happened?
[32:20.77]Everyone quiet.
[32:21.40]It's going to be fine because these are about to touch.
[32:24.96]Oh yes, I got a grenade.
[32:25.94]Oh my God, I got 1000 points.
[32:27.68]I've never seen that before ever because it's the first time I played it.
[32:32.04]OK, things are going fine.
[32:36.23]That is monstrous.
[32:39.57]To get a grenade that early.
[32:42.90]That's what the YouTube video told me on like how to play and not embarrass yourself in front of 60 million people, however many people are here.
[32:49.86]Stop saying grenade.
[32:52.85]It's a melon, I know.
[32:54.05]Haha, wow, you said something that's not the thing.
[32:56.61]Okay.
[33:09.64]Uh, this is going over here.
[33:14.88]I'll get some tomato over here.
[33:16.40]Or an apple.
[33:16.94]Whatever the hell it is.
[33:17.94]Wait, what is it?
[33:20.00]Oh, it's an apple.
[33:26.75]I want these to touch.
[33:29.55]Mmm, that may have been a bad idea.
[33:32.55]I made it to a thousand points.
[33:38.04]You gonna play WoW Classic?
[33:40.72]Uh, no.
[33:42.28]I mean, I...
[33:46.63]I mean there's a joke there where I play wow classic and I do like hardcore and I just stream with a character close my eyes and run in random directions until I die and this the the title of the stream is b how long can I last with my eyes closed in wow classic
[34:21.36]I just walk into the wall in Stormwind.
[34:30.29]And I open my eyes and it's like, oh, I failed.
[34:32.67]And then an ejector seat shoots me through the ceiling.
[34:38.95]You failed.
[34:40.42]I'm waiting for this to touch.
[34:45.56]Will this actually touch these ones down here?
[34:47.48]Probably not.
[34:52.01]If I smush it, maybe it will.
[34:53.66]No.
[34:57.58]Someone just said hurry up.
[34:58.60]There's no time limit on this.
[34:59.88]In fact, you don't want to hurry up.
[35:05.86]Oh, why did I do that?
[35:07.26]I just saw the right color scheme over here and I freaked out.
[35:13.85]I have a lot of these.
[35:14.81]I don't know if I want to do that.
[35:19.80]Alright, is it stupid if I just put this one over here?
[35:24.20]Or drop it right here, just try and launch it into the one on the right?
[35:26.28]Because if I go like that, it might hit those into each other.
[35:34.22]I'm gonna go for it, whatever.
[35:38.61]Turns out, I actually do have a brain.
[35:40.69]Because that was actually kind of good.
[35:48.21]Hold on a second.
[35:49.61]I'm just like... Everybody knows what this is.
[35:53.05]If you don't know what this is, then... I mean, maybe a lot of you don't.
[35:56.75]But you'll know.
[35:57.23]Oh, yeah.
[36:02.45]That's what we call a fresh... What is it?
[36:09.16]Somebody will know what it is.
[36:27.16]an Arizona iced tea you guys have a crack open an Arizona iced tea and just just slam it and it makes that like it's like one of the best sounds in the world not a White Claw what are you talking about okay what am I doing here
[36:51.64]Tea is a warm drink?
[36:53.58]No, sorry.
[36:54.18]I'm American.
[36:55.08]We have to do everything wicked fucked up.
[36:56.96]Sorry.
[36:58.26]Sorry, I'm American.
[36:59.10]We have to do everything wicked fucking weird that everyone else in the world doesn't do.
[37:02.44]Sorry.
[37:05.22]It's actually really good if you don't drink iced tea.
[37:08.32]Get out of here.
[37:09.06]Just leave.
[37:11.82]I am mean today.
[37:14.04]Hey, 40 years old.
[37:15.58]I'm allowed to be fucking grumpy.
[37:19.96]Um...
[37:27.86]I feel like I'm gonna screw this up, but I'm gonna go here.
[37:31.14]Why didn't you tell me to do that differently?
[37:39.93]This is weird.
[37:41.17]It's actually not... I don't think it's gonna fall apart.
[37:44.23]But I have... I'm way too separated.
[37:46.97]Oh, fuck.
[37:47.99]Okay, this is bad.
[37:52.93]I need to push this over here.
[38:02.42]Um... What is better for me right now?
[38:06.92]The right side or the left side?
[38:12.14]Probably the right.
[38:15.48]Yes.
[38:16.90]And then we... Okay, here we go.
[38:19.26]Things are... Wait a minute.
[38:21.92]It's right... If I do it right here, I could cause a chain reaction.
[38:34.62]Because this will turn into that immediately, but will it fall down?
[38:37.40]Let's find out.
[39:00.48]Mmm.
[39:01.28]I'm animating you for my final next Thursday.
[39:03.27]Well, let me give you some voice lines.
[39:11.51]What's that over there?
[39:14.65]Dodged it.
[39:32.83]Hello?
[39:34.39]That was weird.
[39:36.79]I pressed the button on my GoXLR and I turned off my microphone.
[39:41.07]I hope you're making a fighting game or something.
[39:44.43]If not, then... Sorry about that.
[39:51.90]Yeah, my elbow... Okay, I gotta move that.
[39:54.38]Alright, what should I do with this?
[39:55.88]Where do I put this?
[39:56.44]I don't need your help.
[40:02.27]I'll ask for it if I need it.
[40:04.61]Even though I just did.
[40:05.41]Right here.
[40:08.57]God damn it.
[40:10.23]It's fine.
[40:11.41]Okay.
[40:12.27]This is a big deal.
[40:15.11]I'm going to say I want this all the way on the left.
[40:22.66]Hmm.
[40:24.62]Is that going to be apple?
[40:28.36]No, maybe it's apple on the right.
[40:31.18]Or right in the middle.
[40:32.34]But that'll separate this too much, I think.
[40:36.89]Maybe.
[40:37.31]Let's see.
[40:39.77]Now what do I do?
[40:40.35]I'm going to... Is he copying chat?
[40:47.63]No.
[40:49.24]No, I don't even... Don't you dare take this from me.
[40:52.96]If I get to 2,000 points on my first game, I know a lot of you are going to be like, well, he was just reading the chat.
[40:58.36]He stinks and he sucks.
[41:14.94]OK.
[41:26.22]Oh.
[41:29.51]Squeeze.
[41:31.35]Squish it.
[41:35.25]It's OK.
[41:37.71]I have a pretty decent setup coming up here.
[41:40.85]Watch this ready.
[41:41.63]Touch.
[41:46.36]This is gonna pop out and it's gonna squeeze.
[41:51.09]Just let it rest for a sec.
[42:05.03]That's not what I wanted to do, but it's fine.
[42:15.51]hey come on pop out squeeze it damn it okay I got it right here no are you kidding me that rolled right in right at the last second I should have what the what the
[42:42.73]I feel like I am one decent move away from this whole thing just going... This will give me an... But I... If you overflow, it's over.
[42:56.17]Play faster.
[42:57.23]Yeah, but... Shit!
[43:10.59]Wait.
[43:14.79]There it is.
[43:15.65]Okay.
[43:16.01]Let's make a chain.
[43:16.67]Let's come on.
[43:17.39]Chain that together.
[43:22.15]I, okay.
[43:22.69]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[43:23.49]This is, this is a big deal.
[43:25.53]I'm going to drop this right here.
[43:28.36]Don't bounce.
[43:31.80]Oh, fuck.
[43:32.98]Oh, and everybody now is silent.
[43:36.92]The crowd gripped both of their armrests and they shut up real quick there, didn't they?
[43:43.76]I'm about to get a pumpkin.
[43:50.09]um there is a way to mess this up completely so I can do my problem is I don't want to wedge this in anywhere
[44:23.85]Please fit.
[44:26.09]Push it.
[44:27.53]Down.
[44:27.99]It's coming.
[44:29.91]Look.
[44:32.49]Yes.
[44:33.99]Okay.
[44:43.13]This game's exciting.
[44:45.99]Probably left side, right?
[44:53.22]But do I?
[44:53.62]I don't want to wedge it in the middle, though, do I?
[44:56.14]Actually, maybe I. I don't really know, but I guess I could try to get it over here.
[45:03.63]Because then.
[45:06.91]This is going to be really dumb and a lot of people can be really mad.
[45:17.96]Oh yeah, I would be too.
[45:18.92]I, for some reason, thought I was going to wedge the pineapple up.
[45:21.52]That was, uh, not an intelligent thing to do.
[45:31.43]What the fuck just happened?
[45:34.19]What?
[45:34.39]Excuse me?
[45:35.11]What does the video game do that for?
[45:37.41]Why does it do that?
[45:39.07]Why would it do that?
[45:40.61]Why would it do that?
[45:42.35]You know exactly where I was going with that.
[45:43.59]Why did that just do that?
[45:51.99]That was so dumb.
[45:55.16]Um, I'm not going to do that.
[45:57.36]We're going to build this over here.
[46:02.40]Never mind.
[46:04.40]Um, okay.
[46:07.74]It's not a, this is not a horrible situation, but that is.
[46:11.66]Oh shit.
[46:13.52]Um.
[46:19.22]No.
[46:28.45]Okay.
[46:28.73]Dude, how come you can go like that?
[46:37.35]This is not bad, because if I get another apple over here, then I can clear the left side.
[46:44.17]Let's work towards that.
[46:48.61]I'm going to say I need to go...
[47:02.78]I think the right side is a little fucked up right now.
[47:04.80]I'm going to try this.
[47:08.78]Because then I need another grape over on the left.
[47:12.84]Okay, that should be this.
[47:13.60]Okay, cool, cool, cool.
[47:14.96]This is going to work.
[47:18.80]That's fine.
[47:19.28]Okay.
[47:21.71]Not bad.
[47:22.31]This is not.
[47:24.37]This is not terrible.
[47:25.45]This could be way worse.
[47:27.35]So what's next strawberry?
[47:30.76]Now I need to do.
[47:32.10]I need to build on the left side.
[47:33.48]No, I need to go middle.
[47:36.46]This is junk here.
[47:37.16]I gotta go middle with both of these.
[47:39.00]This is junk.
[47:41.86]This is junk.
[47:46.86]Bingo.
[47:48.52]Oops.

[48:27.51]This might be over, but it's still fun.
[48:41.80]I need an apple on the right.

[49:05.62]I'm going like this.
[49:06.74]Uh-oh.

[51:06.28]That was impressive in my book.
[51:12.62]Cool.
[51:13.99]So how is that?
[51:16.99]Cool.
[51:19.27]Look, that's fun.
[51:23.77]So how... So the whole goal now is you try to... So you... Okay.
[51:31.82]I did not know that if you made a pumpkin that it ended the game.
[51:36.44]That's pretty cool.
[51:42.68]It doesn't.
[51:44.90]It doesn't.
[51:46.28]Oh.

[52:14.95]Let me try the... Because it took me about 45 minutes to do that.
[52:23.91]Okay, I just have to stay like after school to complete that test.
[52:29.98]Let me do what that person said.
[52:31.54]They said, hey dude, just spam and I guarantee you get over 100.
[52:34.34]Okay, let's try it.
[52:38.94]I'm just gonna... I'm not even gonna think about it.
[52:40.36]I'm just gonna go.
[52:42.88]Well, it's already really bad because...
[52:46.47]Wait, maybe not yet.
[52:51.27]Ooh.
[52:52.79]Spamming was actually kind of a good idea.
[52:54.45]Holy shit.
[53:03.71]I've already got a completed bottom.
[53:11.57]Okay.
[53:12.17]Keep rolling it.
[53:19.14]Cool.
[53:19.64]Okay.

[53:22.10]You idiot.
[53:24.52]Cool.
[53:25.54]Cool.
[53:27.36]Not cool.
[53:29.82]Not cool.
[53:45.33]Not bad.
[53:45.69]Alright.
[53:47.52]Now we keep these together.
[53:56.73]No, actually, we'll go like this.
[54:00.09]And then like this.
[54:01.67]And then like this.
[54:04.61]And then like this.
[54:07.43]And then... I don't want to do that.
[54:11.60]That's better.
[54:12.12]Okay.
[54:14.08]Let me sneak that in there.
[54:18.02]Push it up.
[54:19.44]Come on.
[54:20.86]Come on.
[54:22.40]Bad.
[54:24.38]Bad.
[54:26.13]Bad.
[54:28.21]Maybe I can do it from here.
[54:30.69]No, that's not good.
[54:36.14]What happened to spam?
[54:37.20]I know, but then it actually started working really well.
[54:47.05]Coward's supposed to be spamming.
[54:48.11]Yeah, but then like look at I got like two apples already Look at this I've already this is no no more spamming.
[54:55.51]No more spamming.
[54:56.05]I might make it a higher score Shit that's that's not good Hopefully I can get that out of the way
[55:24.97]Ah!
[55:29.69]Yeah!
[55:31.19]Okay.
[55:31.91]Everybody relax.
[55:33.91]I have the greatest line ever.
[55:39.22]No, no, no spamming.
[55:40.30]I need to make sure I don't mess this up, though.
[55:42.04]I'm going to say this should be removed from over here.
[55:48.83]All the way to the right.
[55:50.63]Relax.
[55:51.01]I'm relaxing.
[55:51.79]I'm doing good.
[55:55.87]I forgot the Donkey Kong Country soundtrack was playing this whole time.
[55:58.95]I mean, it's great, but... We need some new, um... We need some new music.
[56:09.55]What should I put on?
[56:11.03]I want it to be relaxing.
[56:11.91]I don't want it to be anything intense.
[56:21.32]Um...
[56:23.57]I'm gonna sneak this right here.
[56:28.45]Never mind.
[56:32.92]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[56:38.06]Uh, if I can keep it here, I will.
[56:42.66]No, you stupid man.
[56:45.86]Whatever.
[56:46.74]I fucked it up.
[56:48.14]I was too busy thinking about like different soundtracks.
[56:52.10]I don't even know why I thought of Tron.
[56:55.08]Does Tron even have music in the whole fucking movie?
[56:58.82]I don't know.
[56:59.50]Probably not.
[57:00.52]Maybe it does.
[57:04.60]Uh... What have I done here?
[57:08.66]Can't lose this right now.
[57:09.58]Alright, let's put on something else.
[57:18.26]How about Donkey Kong Country 2?
[57:23.81]I mean, this one is called Stop Overthinking Beautiful Relaxing Music.
[57:28.17]This is kind of what I need right now, isn't it?
[57:30.01]This one has like water.
[57:43.12]It's a stream.
[57:44.28]Okay, we'll do this one for a little bit.
[57:53.27]Let me sneak that in there.
[57:54.75]There.
[57:55.01]I think I saved it.
[58:03.71]I don't know.
[58:04.25]Yeah.
[58:04.81]I don't know what to do.
[58:10.37]It's okay.
[58:11.59]I almost, almost halfway to my, not even close to being halfway.
[58:19.37]I wish I could get that.
[58:20.36]That cherry I think is going to be there permanently.
[58:28.99]Unfortunately.
[58:32.77]I'd love to wedge that in there, but I don't... Oh, boy.
[58:35.85]Can I do it?
[58:37.85]Come on.
[58:39.13]Wedge it in there.
[58:39.63]Okay, things are going good.
[58:50.04]Things are looking up.
[58:51.82]I have to get rid of that shit in the middle.
[58:57.06]Right there...
[59:01.60]Yep.
[59:01.86]Okay, can I... Can I... I'm afraid to... I'll make this wedge even bigger if I put this here, I think.
[59:16.89]Don't put any trash in the middle.
[59:23.43]Okay.
[59:30.48]Okay, uh... I don't want to cover this, so I... Oh, I'm... I just got so mad.
[59:57.56]Push it up.
[60:00.56]Come on!
[60:03.00]Push it up!
[60:04.58]Do it!
[60:06.56]Come on!
[60:07.22]Do it!
[60:17.39]What's the play here?
[60:18.21]To try to bounce the apples into each other?
[60:20.63]Probably.
[60:29.43]That did not work at all.
[60:37.87]What are you talking about?
[60:48.15]Push over.
[60:57.08]There we go.
[60:59.20]Okay, I'm already at 720.
[61:00.36]Dude, how come this does... By the way, how come every time you get something, it doesn't go... Ooh, chain reaction.
[61:15.96]Groovy.
[61:17.36]How come it doesn't do that?
[61:30.08]Well, I mean... I'm putting this over here.
[61:35.29]We're going to build another apple over there.
[61:39.73]I think.
[61:40.07]I don't know.
[61:42.67]Don't ask me.
[61:43.15]Okay.
[61:55.14]Now I need to get that right there.
[61:57.22]Right in the middle.
[61:59.00]Close enough.
[62:02.24]okay now I'm gonna get a uh well I'm gonna get a melon here why is the pineapple scared I don't know
[62:34.01]I do wish it made pop noises.
[62:35.19]Oh, no, it does.
[62:35.69]The game has sound effects.
[62:38.03]It's just the music is one track, I think.
[62:39.94]You want to hear the music for a minute?
[62:43.78]Let's turn it on.
[62:47.72]The game does have sounds.
[62:49.44]This is the game sound.
[62:52.14]If you want to know.
[62:52.80]It's on Halloween mode, so it's probably spooky music.
[62:57.17]But what are the sounds like?
[62:58.19]Let's see.
[63:00.75]This is better.
[63:01.41]This is way better.
[63:06.62]What?
[63:06.84]You don't... What's wrong?
[63:08.48]You guys don't like the part of the movie where the main character remembers his wife?
[63:18.89]You guys... Really?
[63:20.21]And all like the pictures...
[63:34.17]They're like running on like the beach and shit and turning around and looking.
[63:41.34]And it's in its weird film grain all over it.
[63:45.06]Like it came out of the fucking like 1970s.
[63:47.34]Alright, what am I doing?
[63:59.10]Oh, by the way, they play this at least eight or nine times over the course of the movie, and it's the same five clips.
[64:19.19]I don't want to screw this up.
[64:20.21]I'm supposed to be spamming.
[64:21.25]Alright, I promise I'll spam next time.
[64:23.05]Hold me to it.
[64:24.33]Or I'll delete my Twitch channel.
[64:31.31]Mmm, probably left.
[64:40.96]Oh, shoot.
[64:47.47]OK, here it comes.
[64:48.23]I'm going to get it very soon.
[64:51.41]This is going over here.
[64:58.92]Because I want a tomato over there.
[65:00.42]Because I got a tomato right there.
[65:02.62]And then... Yeah, because I'll do tomato.
[65:06.74]And then... Okay, we're going to start building a tomato over here.
[65:11.76]Almost fucked everything up by doing that.
[65:13.40]Nice.
[65:15.26]Okay.
[65:15.93]I'm going to put this right here.
[65:18.09]And... This is bad.
[65:24.55]That's not a place I want that.
[65:32.19]Guys, I can still hear this music.
[65:36.17]I'm getting, I'm still getting this.
[65:41.03]I keep seeing Holly running on a beach looking behind her.
[65:47.09]And like lying down, lying down on a bed, like smiling.
[65:52.33]And it's like she's lying down on her side.
[65:54.81]She's like smiling.
[66:08.83]Put the Halloween music back on.
[66:10.39]I'm still hearing this.
[66:18.26]Uh-huh.
[66:20.06]Yeah, okay, this is like gonna... This is really relaxing music, but we need something a little more... A little more, uh... Vincent's hit and run.
[66:30.04]Eh.
[66:34.47]Okay.
[66:36.07]Pay attention.
[66:37.29]I gotta get at least 2400.
[66:38.05]Do Mega Man?
[66:42.37]Mega Man's not a bad one.
[66:44.10]Which one?
[66:46.20]Mega Man.
[66:48.88]Mega Man.
[66:53.86]Put on Tron.
[66:55.04]Alright, I'm gonna put on the Tron OST. ...
[67:06.98]Wait, this Tron Legacy.
[67:08.66]That's not the one I'm thinking of.
[67:10.76]Yeah, Tron 1982 soundtrack.
[67:13.50]This is it here.
[67:14.98]Let's see.
[67:15.30]What do we got?
[67:17.12]How is it?
[67:35.51]Okay.
[67:41.54]Is this actually the music?
[67:47.26]I like this.
[67:47.84]You know, I've never seen this movie.
[67:50.94]Ever.
[67:59.23]I've never seen a single piece of Tron media.
[68:03.05]Not the new ones, not the old ones.
[68:07.48]And every time they bring it up in Family Guy, I just close my eyes and ears and I just shut everything down and I go... Come on.
[68:21.53]Did that really just happen?
[68:29.27]Ugh.
[68:29.41]At least I have to touch.
[68:37.27]Here we go.
[68:38.61]Just throw it.
[68:39.09]I don't care.
[68:39.45]I'm fine.
[68:41.19]Alright.
[68:41.47]Now we're going to get... That's going to be cool.
[68:55.30]Sometimes you have to freak out and just press buttons.
[69:02.02]Squished that down there.
[69:05.04]That should have been what I wanted.
[69:17.51]Actually, not a bad spot.
[69:24.27]We'll meet again, Spider-Man.
[69:30.26]You thought that Harry was your friend?
[69:34.66]This is kind of like Green Goblin music, isn't it?
[69:39.81]This is Green Goblin music.
[69:47.09]That actually is Palpatine too, yeah.
[69:49.83]Execute order number 666.
[69:57.31]no oh man oh man I feel like somebody just screamed hurry the up so I'm going dude you need to relax some of you guys need to chill out okay seriously chill
[70:42.75]No!
[70:43.13]I'm okay with that.
[70:50.68]Yeah, yep.
[70:51.94]Now that.
[70:53.58]Roll it over.
[70:54.08]Right in there.
[70:58.91]Oh, yes!
[71:09.61]This is a big deal because...
[71:13.59]Uh... This might be stupid, but I'm doing it.
[71:17.67]It's not even... Oh my god, it was stupid.
[71:20.03]It was really stupid.
[71:21.25]How was I supposed to know I was going to get this?
[71:23.32]I'm okay.
[71:23.66]Everything's fine.
[71:24.06]Watch this.
[71:24.56]Boom.
[71:25.76]Check it out.
[71:27.94]No, you can't be doing this to me right now.
[71:30.30]Break it up.
[71:32.80]Touch!
[71:35.22]What happened?
[71:35.75]What the fuck happened?
[71:36.79]What happened?
[71:37.25]What happened?
[71:37.57]What just happened?
[71:38.37]What just happened?
[71:45.25]What?
[71:46.15]Oh, the top left.
[71:47.33]Oh, come on, dude.
[71:48.41]Really?
[71:49.97]Shit.
[71:51.03]That was good.
[71:51.57]Look at how perfect that setup was too.
[71:59.66]This music is all over the place.
[72:03.80]I love it.
[72:04.46]I feel like this is the kind of shit that I would do if I had like Fruity Loops installed.
[72:10.91]This is, I love this.
[72:18.14]Alright, I'm gonna spam, otherwise I have to delete my Twitch channel, so... That's unfortunate.
[72:26.02]Alright, I'm... It doesn't matter where it's going, I'm just gonna spam.
[72:47.10]I feel like a lot of people buy this game and do this, and then they uninstall it because they think it sucks.
[72:51.06]You know what I mean?
[72:57.41]Like, I'm just fucking so bored.
[72:59.47]I'm so bored.
[73:00.77]I'm bored out of my mind right now.
[73:04.09]Dude, can we just do anything else, man?
[73:06.69]Anything.
[73:06.93]I'll do anything.
[73:08.83]Do you want to watch fucking Tron, bro?
[73:10.43]I'll do anything.
[73:11.41]Anything.
[73:11.89]Please get me out of this.
[73:20.63]Why is this kind of working?
[73:31.06]Dude, this is going like kind of good.
[73:46.06]This music is fucking crazy.
[73:54.85]No way.
[74:01.13]Okay, that was kind of fun.
[74:07.29]See, I did it.
[74:09.13]So you can get pretty close to a thousand.
[74:17.34]Turn this off.
[74:18.28]No, dude, it's staying on.
[74:26.05]I don't know what you kids listen to these days, but us, you know, us like 38, 40-year-olds, we put on the Tron beat.
[74:52.40]This game is really addicting, though.
[74:53.84]There's nothing about it.
[74:58.36]It's fun.
[75:00.41]OK, settle down because this is the best start I think I've ever had.
[75:03.67]And I make that sound like it's been awhile, but this is the third game I've ever played.
[75:09.17]So it's not a whole lot of a big sample size or anything.
[75:31.71]Yes!
[75:37.61]Uh... Um... Don't do that.
[75:50.41]Uh... Uh...
[76:01.19]Get in there.
[76:01.65]This music is awesome.
[76:15.94]This is like the Star Wars soundtrack.
[76:19.79]Did a tab of acid.
[76:35.92]Get in there.
[76:39.40]I don't want to blow this because I'm doing a pretty good setup here.
[76:42.92]I don't want to put it over here and I don't really want to put it over here either.
[77:04.71]Ooh, it worked.
[77:05.71]Okay.
[77:14.14]I think I just unlocked something in a lot of you here.
[77:17.42]This is going on the Spotify playlist, I think, for a lot of you here.
[77:25.21]Get in there.
[77:32.15]Beautiful start.
[77:34.31]And...
[77:36.48]Hold on now.
[77:38.80]Don't even don't.
[77:41.12]Don't do what I know what you're going to do, and I don't want you to do it.
[77:43.94]Don't do it.
[77:44.36]I know what you're going to do.
[77:46.12]Thank you.
[77:47.42]You had a strawberry next.
[77:48.52]It's OK.
[78:01.87]Oh, you gotta get in there.
[78:07.28]Yeah.
[78:09.56]Yeah, nice.
[78:12.77]Yeah, that's touching.
[78:14.35]I want a refund.
[78:15.13]It's okay.
[78:31.27]Really good start, actually.
[78:33.47]Look at that.
[78:34.51]And the pineapple's all the way on the right.
[78:35.85]I could not have asked for something better than that.
[78:39.82]So now we have to be careful.
[78:40.72]I'm going to wait for it to settle.
[78:41.56]This is what the guy sitting at the bar by himself sounds like when he has $500 on the game that they're watching.
[78:58.66]And it's something weird, too.
[79:00.78]Like, there's gonna be a field goal in the last minute of the game.
[79:05.57]You know what I mean?
[79:05.99]Like, there's gonna be three field goals in the last two minutes of the game.
[79:09.81]It's like, holy shit, dude.
[79:10.81]You're gonna get, like, a 900%.
[79:11.49]You're gonna get, like, a 900-to-1 return if that happens.
[79:13.67]Uh...
[79:25.60]I think I want to go on the right, but that's probably not a good idea.
[79:29.74]Let's go right there.
[79:32.00]Well, I've ruined everything.
[79:33.70]Everything just got completely ruined and I'm very upset about it.
[79:36.17]Can you tell?
[79:36.53]Oh, sneak it in there.
[79:44.83]That's lost forever.
[79:54.38]Gatorade needs to be orange.
[79:57.29]I think orange Gatorade is one of the kind of mid to lower tier Gatorade flavors.
[80:08.54]I mean, I enjoy it, but I wouldn't consider it to be that high.
[80:14.60]I like, honestly, it's blue, blue, red.
[80:18.19]I like blue more than red.
[80:26.43]Those are going to touch eventually, right?
[80:29.63]Do not squish all the way down there.
[80:40.98]Maybe I should put this here.
[80:43.46]Yeah, I will.
[80:44.04]Because now, here we go.
[80:47.46]That's okay.
[80:52.29]Okay.
[80:53.43]Okay.
[80:54.29]Okay!
[80:56.68]Not ideal.
[81:00.78]Blue is pretty.
[81:01.32]Yeah, blue is good.
[81:02.20]I like purple too.
[81:04.90]I like purple Powerade more than I like purple Gatorade.
[81:07.94]They just taste something different about Powerade.
[81:16.52]I would say purple Powerade is S tier.
[81:19.30]For any of the sports drinks like that.
[81:24.34]Hmm.
[81:35.15]What do you guys think?
[81:37.17]There's no such thing as purple Gatorade?
[81:38.89]I think there is.
[81:39.63]It's one of those weird frost ones.
[81:42.48]It's like a light purple, I think.
[81:44.92]I feel like I kind of have to put this over here.
[81:55.80]Nice.
[81:56.10]If you launch out of here, I'm going to be very mad.
[82:01.57]Okay, I thought I was going to shoot it out.
[82:09.23]I gotta turn this up.
[82:09.89]Are you hearing this?
[82:11.51]I feel like this should be in a different movie than Tron.
[82:22.03]Okay.
[82:24.34]Um...
[82:38.61]I have to be careful here.
[82:39.35]Yeah, right here.
[82:47.84]Right there.
[82:48.90]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[82:53.07]Hold on, hold on.
[82:59.71]Good.
[83:00.85]Do it.
[83:01.59]Alright, alright.
[83:03.43]Not perfect, but we're okay.
[83:13.46]Damn it.
[83:14.36]Oh, that was really bad.
[83:18.80]I have to get rid of this.
[83:19.50]Maybe I can push them together.
[83:25.97]I don't know how that even happened, but whatever.
[83:33.17]Come on, push it a little bit more.
[83:43.60]Come on!
[83:47.20]I ruined it?
[83:47.76]No, I didn't.
[83:51.36]I'm going to put the cherry on the right side.
[83:53.08]I think that's what I want to do.
[83:55.92]Uh oh.
[83:56.74]I actually might have fucked it up.
[84:03.44]Bad.
[84:03.70]That's actually very bad.
[84:05.54]The worst thing that probably could have happened.
[84:16.07]Really?
[84:16.85]Just push over there.
[84:17.89]Here we go.
[84:21.13]Uh-oh.
[84:26.31]Oh, shit.
[84:31.71]Oh, shit.
[84:37.12]Come on.
[84:37.88]Pop.
[84:38.80]Come on.
[84:39.32]Get in there.
[84:41.32]Come on.
[84:42.08]Push.
[84:43.66]Oh shit.
[84:46.94]No, no, no.
[84:49.38]Oh, it's OK.
[84:54.36]Too bad.
[84:58.11]Maybe if it.
[85:05.11]No, it's even worse.
[85:19.36]okay now I this is not a problem now if I can get I got a cherry right here just don't don't hop over here right watch this come on this would be big deal if I get it
[85:33.73]I gotta get it right.
[85:35.35]I wish I could press a button and hold a button so I could move like Peggle.
[85:41.30]Tiny, tiny amounts.
[85:44.78]Good.
[85:45.04]Okay.
[85:48.17]This is gonna be good.
[85:48.77]This is it.
[85:55.71]OK, I need a. I need a. I need a grape.
[86:10.46]I'm terrified to put that over here.
[86:13.38]I'm gonna put it over here.
[86:16.20]Come on man.
[86:19.10]Grape.
[86:21.07]Alright touch.
[86:32.43]That's not good.
[86:37.07]And now I'm just... I just rage spammed it.
[86:43.86]That's sad.
[86:45.76]Sad.
[86:52.24]Sad.
[86:53.08]Look at sad.
[86:53.78]What just happened?
[86:58.41]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[86:59.17]What happened?
[87:01.31]I just did it.
[87:03.05]I thought I just completely, I thought it was over.
[87:08.87]We're back.
[87:09.63]We're completely back in business.
[87:14.43]Okay.
[87:15.90]Let's get this over here.
[87:18.62]Alright, here we go.
[87:25.80]Ooh, you sneak in a grape right there.
[87:29.45]Will that fit?
[87:33.43]No.
[87:37.24]But I think I'm alright.
[87:48.38]This could be way worse right now.
[88:12.74]Are you trying to tell me what kind of physics is this?
[88:16.32]This is backstory music.
[88:18.22]Oh, there it is.
[88:18.68]OK, OK, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[88:22.69]I need... Turn this down a little because that's way too loud.
[88:32.28]I almost have a pineapple on the right.
[88:38.72]I'm wondering if this is a bad idea.
[88:40.52]It is.
[88:40.78]I'm going to go over here with this.
[88:45.93]Because I need two apples and then it's pretty much a done deal.
[88:51.95]Let's try to get an apple over here.
[88:53.29]Don't you piece of garbage.
[88:56.34]It's okay.
[89:09.50]This would be fine.
[89:10.28]I'm going to get it.
[89:10.78]I'll get it right here.
[89:17.84]Okay.
[89:18.94]Here it is.
[89:19.48]We're good.
[89:20.04]Everything is fine because watch this.
[89:26.19]There it is, there it is, there it is, there it is.
[89:27.29]We're good.
[89:28.43]Start it.
[89:29.13]Boom.
[89:30.90]Yeah!
[89:31.36]Alright.
[89:32.50]Everybody hold up.
[89:33.50]Hold up, hold up, hold up.
[89:36.48]Let me sneak that in there.
[89:39.22]The thing is way too huge.
[89:40.36]Okay.
[89:41.20]Oh, no.
[89:44.72]That's... Oh, I got too excited.
[89:46.40]I got way too excited.
[89:53.97]This is not terrible, though.
[89:58.57]I'm only dropping cherries on the left.
[89:59.95]That's it.
[90:01.00]Nothing else.
[90:11.22]Okay, now... I'm gonna say... Let's continue to drop cherries on the left.
[90:22.67]We can build this over here on the right.
[90:23.79]Let's drop... Well, I might block it.
[90:29.79]That was that was Adobe thing to do.
[90:32.51]But I think it's going to make it all the way down and then I'm going to follow it up.
[90:43.44]Wipeout.
[90:48.06]OK.
[90:50.02]This is this is looking like it could be a pretty good one.
[90:53.38]Turn the music up.
[90:54.82]Sorry about that.
[90:58.80]I'm going to continue to put cherries on left.
[91:03.44]I think that's the smart thing to do.
[91:14.39]Hmm.
[91:18.05]This should do something cool here.
[91:21.39]Bingo.
[91:23.45]Alright.
[91:26.49]Hmm.
[91:29.11]How do I still?
[91:29.63]I still have 2000 points.
[91:31.51]That's it.
[91:35.11]A 19 what?
[91:35.49]1962, that's it.
[91:37.49]Wanna horse shit.
[91:40.84]OK, the left is.
[91:44.50]I'm thinking I just drove.
[91:45.66]I'm going to try to put it right here.
[91:49.90]That was bad.
[91:51.02]It's OK though.
[91:52.52]I just don't have to bounce over.
[91:54.24]There we go, perfect.
[91:56.52]Nice.
[92:00.98]Okay.
[92:02.80]This is doing just fine.
[92:04.35]Open that little space up right there.
[92:07.51]Come on.
[92:11.29]This is alright right there.
[92:17.46]Good.
[92:18.06]Alright.
[92:18.94]Oh, this is going to be big.
[92:23.08]I almost want to put a cherry on the right.
[92:28.31]That pumpkin is a troll-level bad hitbox.
[92:32.03]It is huge, isn't it?
[92:39.29]I almost want to just keep squishing stuff over there, but... No, we're gonna do this.
[92:47.99]Nice.
[92:48.55]Okay.
[92:48.81]Hey, I did it!
[92:50.11]I beat my old high score.
[92:52.81]And I'm still going.
[92:56.33]New score, we're good.
[93:09.04]I think I can do grapes over here.
[93:11.81]I'm not terrified of that.
[93:15.29]Don't bounce.
[93:15.97]Let me get it in the right spot.
[93:17.09]Don't bounce.
[93:17.47]I was just I was just here.
[93:22.38]I think it's OK though.
[93:28.56]fine oh it's fine look at that what is going on this is like the best OST I think I've ever heard this is what I would imagine if somebody's like hey play me the superman theme song on your old keyboard like just play me superman what how do you think it sounds
[93:55.68]Like, I don't know.
[93:59.48]Something like that.
[94:04.10]Perfect.
[94:04.54]Look at that.
[94:05.02]Come on, get down there.
[94:06.10]Come on.
[94:12.61]That should be falling right now.
[94:14.59]It really should be.
[94:17.19]Sorry, though.
[94:25.80]Ooh, look at that.
[94:29.52]Okay.
[94:32.18]Cool.
[94:33.62]I'm having fun.
[94:34.22]Alright, we'll do... I'm going to do Chariot right on top.
[94:48.10]Nice.
[94:51.45]Uh, this is going over here.
[94:55.16]And shit.
[94:57.30]I got a little too overzealous on that one.
[95:00.88]That was very overzealous.
[95:04.44]It's alright.
[95:05.20]I can save it.
[95:06.76]This is very saveable.
[95:08.32]Much.
[95:11.04]Very saveable.
[95:14.34]Yeah.
[95:14.90]I'm good.
[95:15.40]Saveable.
[95:19.13]You fool.
[95:19.83]It's alright.
[95:22.95]It's saveable.
[95:24.87]all I need is I need I need it is winnable absolutely is especially now that actually helped a lot okay this is okay this is gonna be alright
[96:08.72]No, we're fine.
[96:09.48]Stop freaking out.
[96:17.76]There it is.
[96:18.06]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[96:27.21]Yes, yes.
[96:33.84]How do I fix it?
[96:36.28]I gotta fill the middle up, that's how I fix it.
[96:45.92]Yes!
[96:46.10]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[97:03.12]I don't know what to do here.
[97:05.62]Is the idea to should I push the try to push the pineapple down or should I just try to mix up the stuff in the middle?
[97:17.65]Oh boy.
[97:18.61]Oh boy.
[97:20.51]Oh boy, OK.
[97:23.07]I have to move the pineapple somehow.
[97:36.72]This is getting kind of hairy.
[97:37.68]I'll take 2,500, I will.
[97:39.54]That sounds pretty good.
[97:40.32]Ah, that strawberry's messing everything up, though.
[97:48.63]Are you purposely altering your Suika storyline to fit the music?
[97:55.98]Is it going to the music?
[97:57.12]I can't even really tell.
[97:59.54]Is it?
[97:59.76]Um...
[98:08.91]I'm kind of just put it right here.
[98:09.92]If I can get it, if I can fit it right here.
[98:19.50]Ooh.
[98:21.04]Don't pop it out.
[98:22.90]Oh, perfect.
[98:24.28]Actually un-be-lievable.
[98:29.55]Unbelievable.
[98:31.21]Touch.
[98:33.65]Touch.
[98:35.67]Oh.
[98:38.58]It's right there.
[98:41.74]Oh.
[98:46.28]Do I dare do this or should I just try to pop?
[98:48.54]I'm going to try to pile everything on the right side so it launches the apples into each other.
[98:54.63]I got to go on the right side so I can try to push some pressure over on the left side.
[98:57.59]Because I don't think this is going to fit in there.
[99:03.08]That was a mistake and everybody knows it.
[99:04.68]Okay.
[99:05.78]Okay.
[99:08.50]I have to just hold on.
[99:10.52]Hold on.
[99:10.80]There's a last.
[99:11.50]There's a last attempt here.
[99:15.54]Wait, things are moving.
[99:19.27]Should I just not touch anything?
[99:21.61]Wait, should I do it?
[99:24.89]Oh, fuck you.
[99:26.13]Come on.
[99:29.77]No.
[99:32.37]Quack, quack, quack, quack.
[99:33.51]Quack, quack, quack, quack.
[99:34.15]It's alright.
[99:35.47]I'll take 2600.
[99:40.03]Cool.
[99:41.17]Oh, they would hit each other right there too.
[99:42.49]You got too cocky.
[99:48.62]I was just I was trying to do that.
[99:50.66]I was hoping that the two lemons were going to hit each other before it went out.
[99:55.62]25 2588.
[99:58.74]Is that a good score?
[100:00.36]Is that decent?
[100:02.78]Is that a good score?
[100:08.65]I heard that like 3000 is good.
[100:10.65]3000 is like, whoa, that's pretty good.
[100:14.21]It's OK.
[100:16.31]Yeah, it's fun.
[100:24.57]We've heard almost the entire soundtrack to this movie, by the way.
[100:34.65]What happens when you combine two pumpkins?
[100:37.73]I am going to take a wild guess.
[100:39.45]I'm going to say it turns into a cherry.
[100:46.18]Or does it just disappear?
[100:49.32]Because it looks like Circle of Evolution looks like it turns into a cherry or maybe just deletes it.
[100:57.94]You cannot combine them.
[100:59.60]Oh, they just disappear.
[101:00.26]Okay.
[101:02.23]I'm gonna do one more like who gives a and then uh yeah one more who cares run I don't want them to bounce all over the place that's not what I wanted to do oh we need a new soundtrack
[101:33.24]Might as well just listen to the whole thing.
[101:36.26]It's over in five minutes.
[101:37.36]This is great.
[101:42.41]I like this one.
[101:56.66]Put on Indiana Jones.
[101:58.98]Mm-mm-mm-mm.
[102:00.66]Mm-mm-mm.
[102:08.06]That's how that goes, right?
[102:13.15]Jesus.
[102:16.45]That was a big reveal.
[102:17.57]Something really wild happened.
[102:29.42]I think I may have screwed it up already.
[102:38.91]Nice.
[102:46.21]Nothing happens in this movie.
[102:47.39]It's boring as shit.
[102:52.04]Tell me how you really feel.
[103:00.96]Squeeze that down.
[103:01.56]Come on.
[103:05.26]I'm OK with that.
[103:11.40]Oh, that was... Okay, now we're going to talk about things that just changed the course of all human history.
[103:20.89]It may have been that.
[103:22.37]It may have been that right there.
[103:48.48]Just don't want to get anything really small on the bottom.
[103:51.09]It's the worst thing.
[103:51.79]Okay, here we go.
[103:52.37]This will be good.
[103:55.25]Nice.
[103:55.89]Perfect placement, too.
[103:56.67]All the way on the left.
[103:57.67]Tons of... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[104:11.37]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[104:12.11]I don't wanna get too cocky here, cuz.
[104:16.39]Dax accidentally.
[104:19.65]Sorry.
[104:30.96]Jet.
[104:34.12]No, that's not what I wanted, but it's OK.
[104:36.16]There's gonna be one strawberry in the bottom.
[104:40.08]That's a pain in my ass.
[104:46.17]Ooh may have.
[104:48.05]This is actually not a bad thing.
[104:51.24]Not as bad as I thought it was going to be.
[105:00.96]Will it fit?
[105:02.08]If I get it perfect, it might squish them.
[105:04.92]Or is it... There actually might not be any room to move them.
[105:08.46]And that gives even more space between those two lemons.
[105:11.16]That's probably a terrible idea. ...
[105:36.14]Good.
[105:38.18]Could be better, but still OK.
[105:39.28]Alright, we're gonna get this one gone.
[105:44.14]Watch that cherry.
[105:58.47]Come on, get in there.
[106:07.91]The Sims cry.
[106:19.60]Yay.
[106:27.33]Let's not be too hasty here.
[106:32.62]Shit.
[106:38.72]I don't really have a good place to put this.
[106:48.61]Put it on top of the tomato.
[106:50.87]I'm afraid I'm going to do that and it's going to bounce.
[106:53.83]You were right.
[106:54.23]Time that person up for an hour.
[106:58.95]Making me look bad in front of my audience.
[107:14.58]You are mean tonight.
[107:16.62]I'm just... I'm just comfortable.
[107:19.44]You know what I mean?
[107:19.88]I'm just comfy.
[107:22.06]I'm just like, ah, you know what?
[107:22.90]I'm just... Whatever.
[107:23.72]I'm just gonna say whatever the hell I'm gonna say.
[107:25.84]Just having fun.
[107:26.82]Chilling out.
[107:28.27]You're getting too comfortable right now.
[107:31.11]I am leaning back.
[107:32.21]You are right.
[107:34.01]Posture check.
[107:35.79]It's not good.
[107:42.31]Hmm.
[107:42.53]Hmm.
[107:53.03]If I put it here, I'm going to close this gap and I really.
[107:56.37]Say goodbye to those cherries in that grape ever being used again, but whatever.
[108:07.10]I think it's the middle one.
[108:10.80]Because then I can bump that.
[108:12.20]OK, perfect.
[108:25.79]Alright.
[108:28.69]You might have thought that was really dumb.
[108:31.57]And it was.
[108:33.19]But don't say it out loud.
[108:36.75]Actually, no, it wasn't.
[108:38.39]Yeah, we're good.
[108:39.32]We're good.
[108:53.00]Now I'm in trouble, though.
[109:29.73]No!
[109:32.35]I knew that was going to happen too.
[109:34.29]I could see it from a mile away and I still did it.
[109:37.97]Oh man, what on Earth?
[109:40.19]What are you doing?
[109:47.49]Oh, this is like every... Wait.
[109:54.20]It's actually not terrible.
[109:56.60]I don't think.
[109:57.04]Because... I can get this to go in here.
[110:04.66]Come on.
[110:06.70]Where are these fruits?
[110:08.00]How come they're not going down?
[110:11.04]Go down!
[110:11.66]I want that one in the middle to get hit.
[110:16.97]You know what?
[110:21.07]Oops.
[110:31.02]Shit!
[110:33.17]No, I screwed it up then I got.
[110:37.98]I got all caught up.
[110:40.12]It can be salvaged if the right, but look at all this.
[110:45.18]What happened here?
[110:49.00]It's ludicrous what happened right here.
[110:54.93]I'm not even happy about that because look at how spread out this is now.
[111:05.59]I have to clear.
[111:08.93]I have to do this.
[111:09.65]Dude.
[111:21.38]Come on.
[111:29.28]This is going to cause a chain reaction eventually.
[111:47.04]Eventually this is going to be... this is going to explode.
[111:59.75]Why?
[112:02.95]Listen, what is this?
[112:04.47]This is an electric guitar coming up from Tron, the official soundtrack.
[112:12.64]What is this?
[112:17.31]Is this a Tron song?
[112:21.77]Ah.
[112:23.17]Okay.
[112:27.40]Oh.
[112:31.40]Oh, uh oh.
[112:36.04]Touch.
[112:37.87]Please.
[112:44.85]Oh, you just touch already.
[112:59.88]Oh, this is a licensed music.
[113:03.38]That's the ending credits.
[113:07.64]That's when, yeah, okay, so it's the final scene.
[113:11.46]I get it, yeah.
[113:12.22]That was when they both ride off into the sunset.
[113:16.38]And the credits, it's like... See you later, Dave.
[113:21.73]It's been a trip.
[113:26.21]And the credits go up.
[113:27.81]They start.
[113:31.46]And then it goes... Okay, that was fun.
[113:52.91]I think I'm in trouble, though.
[114:00.79]Why do you hate Duck Dynasty?
[114:05.30]I don't think I've ever sat through an episode of Duck Dynasty.
[114:09.10]Who told you that?
[114:20.24]Oh, this actually is over.
[114:27.52]Something goofy could happen right here.
[114:30.10]But I doubt it.
[114:42.37]Oh, I just want that to be.
[114:44.81]Whoa.
[114:48.39]No.
[114:53.18]That was such a troll.
[114:54.68]It really was.
[114:55.22]Hey, let's put on my favorite part of the Toronto ST.
[115:12.12]I have so many of these working in such random places.
[115:14.88]Yeah, this one's... I got a little... I got too... I got a little... I got a little cute with this one.
[115:26.41]You know what I mean?
[115:27.93]Like, oh, okay, let me do this.
[115:30.05]I messed it all up from the beginning.
[115:32.86]It could come... It could come back.
[115:37.50]But it needs to be... Hold on.
[115:42.25]Here we go.
[115:44.31]Do it!
[115:45.23]Yes!
[115:46.43]Okay, it's not over.
[115:47.21]I just need a bunch of shit to happen.
[116:15.56]It's just gonna pop out.
[116:16.86]Yeah, that's it.
[116:37.07]Wait a minute.
[116:38.19]Wait a minute.
[116:39.13]Wait a minute.
[116:39.83]Wait a minute.
[116:43.87]It's not over yet.
[116:49.41]It's not over.
[116:59.25]Fuck.
[117:07.71]I just need something stupid to happen over here.
[117:11.92]Oh, oh.
[117:19.40]Ooh.
[117:21.86]Ooh.
[117:22.84]Ooh.
[117:25.92]Ooh.
[117:30.43]Ooh.
[117:42.55]Does this count?
[117:44.53]Okay, wait.
[117:45.69]Does this count if I blow this up?
[117:47.43]Does this count?
[117:48.95]If I do this, will it... Oh, it counts.
[117:53.30]Hey, that's fine.
[117:54.24]It's better.
[117:54.60]Alright, one more spamming one and... Do something else for a little bit.
[118:10.74]This is really fun though.
[118:11.41]I like it a lot.
[118:15.25]One more somewhat spammy one.
[118:39.60]Pretty bad so far, but we're good.
[118:41.68]Don't worry.
[118:42.82]Got this under control.
[118:49.08]I've spaced them out perfectly to have ruined the entire run.
[119:10.72]I must be your master at that!
[119:20.47]This is spammy though, I'm not, we're just, we're just spamming.
[119:27.32]Not trying to do anything else.
[119:28.10]Is this the same soundtrack?
[119:47.92]Oh, shut up.
[119:48.96]How does that not work?
[119:51.08]You know what?
[119:51.63]Fuck it.
[119:59.08]Okay, okay.
[119:59.86]Now we settle down.
[120:15.46]No, the strawberry was supposed to go there.
[120:17.62]You dolt.
[120:20.28]I'm so... I'm really sorry.
[120:22.06]Jeez.
[120:43.77]I have to put something else on or I'm going to go crazy.
[120:49.55]It's only, uh... Okay.
[120:55.67]Uh, I think we just watched the whole Tron movie.
[120:59.87]The soundtrack is 50 minutes long and we... I've listened to it for about an hour and 20 minutes, haven't I?
[121:05.95]We just saw the whole movie.
[121:09.67]Was that every... Hold on.
[121:11.77]Was that every scene in Tron?
[121:15.55]Now do Tron Legacy.
[121:16.83]Alright, we're on a thing tonight, might as well.
[121:22.03]Tron Legacy OST.
[121:28.01]This one, if this one's not as goofy as the other one, I don't know if I'm going to be happy about it.
[121:36.90]Let's see.
[121:37.74]How does it compare to the old one?
[121:45.89]Might as well just delete the VOD.
[121:47.81]Eh, whatever.
[121:50.37]Hmm, okay.
[121:52.35]It's a little scary at first.
[122:04.98]Is this... Is it playing?
[122:13.33]Okay, there it is.
[122:32.13]I would love it if it did that.
[122:35.05]If that just started.
[122:35.85]Hmm.
[122:52.99]Ooh, that's why you always wait a second before you do anything.
[122:56.81]That was a huge mistake that's going to cost me.
[123:00.21]Big time.
[123:16.74]Nice.
[123:19.86]Yeah, why is this so compressed?
[123:25.51]I feel like I'm watching this over your shoulder through your phone.
[123:31.35]Why does this sound so weird?
[123:36.90]It adds to it.
[123:40.20]It doesn't.
[123:41.28]Okay, I need a better one.
[123:45.10]Tron Legacy Complete Soundtrack.
[123:54.88]uh this one's like this one's on vinyl damn tron legacy is it this one let's see if this one sounds any better this is different is it is this right
[124:22.86]Your game is fucked.
[124:24.03]Um, yeah, it's alright.
[124:33.23]The song kicks ass.
[124:34.93]OK.
[124:39.11]Yeah, I'll give it a chance, sir.
[124:53.05]I mean, I blew it a long time ago, so... So, do people play this game, do they get to the point where they just reset?
[125:00.80]They go, nope, I'm done, reset.
[125:07.24]Is there a certain part where you know that you have to reset?
[125:11.17]Yeah.
[125:15.01]Yeah.
[125:20.65]That's Ludwig every run.
[125:22.05]Yeah, he's been playing this, right?
[125:44.76]Ooh.
[125:45.06]I like the...
[125:49.93]They've got me so far.
[125:53.15]Turn it up.
[125:57.17]I'm going to turn it up.
[125:57.85]So just turn yours down because hopefully there's no like loud like blasts or anything.
[126:03.28]I'm turning mine up.
[126:07.54]Like this does not go like or something, does it?
[126:19.22]It does or I'm turning it down.
[126:24.14]You lied, it didn't do anything.
[126:25.54]Now leave it up.
[126:31.11]Alright, I'll turn it up.
[126:31.91]You turn yours down.
[126:34.53]But be aware that could it could be like a hold on.
[126:42.23]This kind of sounds like Batman.
[126:59.52]This is this run is a piece of.
[127:02.18]Shit by the way.
[127:05.72]You know what?
[127:06.26]Yeah, well this is a piece of crap right now.
[127:08.32]This is not going to happen.
[127:13.14]It just isn't.
[127:13.62]Alright, one more one more one more, but we gotta hear some of the Tron legacy soundtrack.
[127:38.29]Shit.
[127:40.19]Hate when they roll like that.
[127:44.31]And except when it's in my favor, I love it when it does that.
[127:59.22]Hey.
[128:01.94]I'm I'm waiting for it.
[128:03.38]You know it's going to happen.
[128:05.40]The actual song is about to start and what is it going to sound like?
[128:08.00]Let's see.
[128:12.10]And.
[128:12.32]And.
[128:17.54]And.
[128:17.70]Here it comes.
[128:20.38]Here it comes.
[128:25.32]Yeah.
[128:32.13]Here it is.
[128:35.63]Here, this is it right here.
[128:38.85]Here it comes.
[128:49.38]This is the intro to Iron Chef.
[128:55.31]That's not what I thought was going to happen.
[129:14.08]Whose cuisine will reign supreme.
[129:21.72]He studied all over the world.
[129:24.10]The master of ceremonies, whatever his name is.
[129:27.24]Then he takes a big bite out of the bell pepper and it's like...
[129:34.71]That old Iron Chef goes hard.
[129:36.93]That's one of the best shows ever.
[129:38.63]Yeah, when you had Morimoto... Cooking all kinds of shit.
[129:51.47]Oh, man.
[129:54.31]The fire would just be blazing up.
[129:56.83]People would be running around screaming.
[129:58.41]They'd just be like, whoa, what's that?
[130:00.53]Squeeze-on.
[130:01.90]Squeeze-on.
[130:02.60]Yes, what is it?
[130:03.62]I talked to Iron Chef Morimoto, and he's putting in toothpaste into this, weirdly enough.
[130:11.62]Toothpaste.
[130:12.04]Wow, interesting.
[130:12.88]Yes, yes.
[130:17.95]Squeeze-on.
[130:19.79]We got to bring back the squeeze-on, I think.
[130:27.79]I want to separate these.
[130:29.89]Yep.
[130:46.24]Somebody just wrote, what are you talking about?
[130:56.02]I am gonna change your life.
[130:58.32]You gotta go back.
[130:59.18]Okay, just type in original Iron Chef Japanese program.
[131:06.10]And you've got like a hundred years of content that you're gonna love.
[131:10.23]I'm just... You're gonna love it.
[131:12.07]You've got so much.
[131:12.99]What an envious position to be in.
[131:14.27]Dude, remember the guy that would come out and do fucking backflips?
[131:25.99]It was, it was, uh, what was it?
[131:27.57]It was, um... The owner of the program, I think his nephew, his nephew eventually took it over, and he would come out and do backflips and cartwheels and shit, wouldn't he?
[131:42.70]Yeah, the chairman.
[131:43.40]Oh, it was awesome!
[131:45.98]This guy would come out and just do, like, back handsprings, and it was like, yeah, that's what you're doing.
[131:51.12]This is a chef, this is a program where we cook food, but you're just going off, and it's awesome.
[132:03.31]It was a legendary television show.
[132:05.65]Legendary.
[132:12.88]The mystery ingredient.
[132:16.86]There was so much showmanship with it.
[132:20.02]Gotta bring that shit back.
[132:30.15]What's it called?
[132:30.75]Iron Chef.
[132:31.69]They still do it.
[132:32.33]I think it's in its 40th season or something.
[132:35.68]Do they still do it on Food Network?
[132:37.92]I know Food Network grabbed it and did their own kind of version, right?
[132:42.74]It's not the same as the Japanese one, though.
[132:45.03]Not even close.
[132:49.13]It was still good for a while, and it might still be good.
[132:51.23]I haven't really seen it, if it's still on.
[133:01.79]Yeah, Iron Ship America.
[133:02.73]Yeah.
[133:02.87]Alright.
[133:11.12]When is Batman going to step on the gas of the Batmobile?
[133:16.98]I mean, Tron bike.
[133:18.52]There it is.
[133:20.91]Wrong.
[133:21.61]Wrong car.
[133:22.39]Sorry.
[133:32.54]I gotta squish this down here.
[133:33.66]Oh, that is very sad.
[133:42.27]Turn it up, man.
[133:45.77]I don't want to turn it up that high.
[133:49.11]It's a good volume right now.
[133:53.93]We need more juice.
[133:55.43]It's up a little.
[133:57.63]Just a little more.
[133:58.53]You should mute your microphone.
[134:01.69]Alright, now you got me.
[134:02.59]This is actually... This is kicking now.
[134:10.07]No.
[134:10.59]I ruined it.
[134:13.48]And I knew I did.
[134:14.16]This actually is really good.
[134:44.88]Imagine this is how you made smoothies.
[134:50.00]Kind of is.
[134:51.50]It's not this much.
[134:58.15]Ah.
[135:01.10]I don't want to separate these that much, but it's alright.
[135:10.57]Do I dare?
[135:13.13]No.
[135:21.05]Oh, I was I was waiting for the drop.
[135:42.64]Shit.
[135:43.30]It's okay.
[135:44.28]I'll just stick that right there.
[135:53.56]Come on.
[135:54.52]If that strawberry wasn't there, it would've been perfect.
[136:07.91]Dude!
[136:10.01]What are you on about?
[136:11.84]You play Liza P?
[136:13.82]No, I haven't really been playing very many games.
[136:18.60]I played a few here and there.
[136:19.36]I don't know if my brain is ready for a really hard, intense action RPG.
[136:33.12]I'm saving my... Wait a minute.
[136:36.71]That was really good.
[136:38.53]Let's look at this.
[136:41.96]Never mind.
[136:44.24]Oh, come on, man.
[136:46.81]I'm saving it for the Elden Ring DLC.
[136:48.07]I mean, I know I tell you guys I'm retired, but when Elden Ring comes out, I'm going to stream that literally like all day, every day until I'm done with it.
[137:02.93]As a one thing that you know when it comes out, I'm going to play it a lot on stream.
[137:14.23]That much is certain for sure.
[137:26.18]Are you actually retired now?
[137:28.32]Yeah, I mean, like, no.
[137:31.51]Yeah, it's kind of everywhere.
[137:36.37]It's just easier to say it rather than be like, well, you know, it's a soft retiree.
[137:42.88]It just, just assume that I am.
[137:44.42]It's easier that way.
[137:47.00]He's only retired when it's convenient.
[138:08.10]I kind of should have paid more attention in physics class.
[138:20.77]Okay, this is a great soundtrack, but I feel like every track needs a visual accompaniment.
[138:30.05]Because right now we're kind of just waiting for the main character to like fly off the cliff or something, right?
[138:36.43]Like we're just waiting for the main character is staring at somebody and there's a big fight scene that's happening.
[138:41.59]There needs to be a visual with this.
[138:43.61]Otherwise, it's just like, something's coming, something's coming, something's coming, something's coming, something's coming, something's coming, something's coming, something's coming, something's coming, something's coming.
[138:52.96]I don't have the bike blowing by the landscape to accompany this.
[139:01.80]It's good.
[139:03.08]I would say it's very good.
[139:05.84]Okay, this is the most replayed part.
[139:07.63]I don't want to skip it.
[139:08.75]Let's see what it is.
[139:11.69]It's going to be a huge payoff right here.
[139:25.13]Okay.
[139:26.55]Come on!
[139:33.65]Do it!
[139:34.27]Where is it?
[139:41.82]Ah, I fucked it up.
[139:42.62]I was paying too much attention to the music.
[139:50.00]Oh.
[139:50.92]Wait.
[139:52.28]Actually kind of good.
[139:56.45]That's not a bad thing.
[140:05.09]Alright.
[140:06.32]Listen, this is, I got, I'm keeping this one.
[140:08.70]This one sounds good.
[140:18.22]Oh, come on.
[140:19.97]It's like I did it on purpose.
[140:30.01]There we go finally.
[140:31.37]Whoa.
[140:45.05]I got kind of crazy.
[140:56.08]Alright.
[140:57.22]Now's the opportunity to make a melon.
[141:02.42]The actual songs start now.
[141:04.84]So that was all the visual accompaniment stuff, and now the music is coming.
[141:13.74]I get it.
[141:14.26]Okay, that's cool.
[141:23.30]I don't want to put this down there.
[141:33.16]Okay.
[141:35.04]This should clear this up a little bit.
[141:37.94]Okay.
[141:38.64]Hold on.
[141:41.39]I'm going to keep doing that.
[141:44.17]Might as well.
[141:46.35]Okay.
[141:46.81]That's fine.
[141:53.59]Give me another strawberry.
[141:56.15]That's not a strawberry.
[142:01.98]Neither is that.
[142:03.70]You just ruined everything.
[142:05.22]That little... That little... We're fine.
[142:09.69]Everybody chill.
[142:10.69]I gotta get that down there.
[142:23.09]Uh... Uh-oh.
[142:40.32]I love that sound.
[142:44.34]Your movie gets like plus 5% on Rotten Tomatoes if you have in your movie.
[142:53.49]I think that's accurate.
[142:55.97]It's like maybe 3% extra that you get.
[143:09.69]I don't want to put that over there.
[143:20.70]Shit.
[143:21.02]It'll be worse.
[143:34.76]There it is.
[143:35.32]Alright.
[143:36.50]Now, what the heck is going on here?
[143:42.30]People saying put on the right song.
[143:44.08]Okay, let me see.
[143:51.74]That was good.
[143:55.59]Play End of the Line.
[143:57.35]The song is called End of the Line.
[143:58.79]I don't see that on here.
[144:09.14]The song is called D-Rez'd.
[144:11.56]D-Rez'd.
[144:12.40]D-Rez'd.
[144:13.10]Is that in Tron?
[144:17.18]D-Rez'd.
[144:18.07]Let's check it out.
[144:24.31]Oh, Daft Punk.
[144:25.61]D-Rez'd from Tron Legacy.
[144:31.73]Is this the song that would play when it would do the trailer, like the 10-second trailer that you'd see?
[144:38.69]It's the funniest movie of the year.
[144:40.73]That kind of stuff, right?
[144:43.03]Critics are calling Tron Legacy the funniest movie of the year.
[144:46.57]The most action-packed sequences.
[144:48.27]It's that, right?
[144:54.43]Tron Legacy, rated PG.
[144:58.55]Is this the trailer one?
[145:02.10]Let's see.
[145:04.30]Oh shit, okay.
[145:11.52]There's video game sound effects in this.
[145:13.78]Plus 5% in my personal Rotten Tomatoes.
[145:25.13]Oh, I've heard this song before.
[145:26.11]Yeah, this song is good.
[145:52.10]It's the funniest movie of the year.
[145:53.68]Yeah, this is this is good.
[146:15.27]It's Daft Punk though, it's gonna be good.
[146:18.21]It's gonna be good.
[146:26.72]I want one more pumpkin before I leave this game.
[146:30.72]You think I can do it?
[146:33.10]Watch to the end of the video.
[146:36.69]You better.
[146:38.73]How will you know?
[146:58.00]Alright, I'm getting close to a pumpkin.
[147:08.16]Tron Legacy.
[147:09.95]Rated PG.
[147:11.81]In theaters this Friday.
[147:12.93]In theaters this Christmas.
[147:14.17]In theaters this November.
[147:15.41]In theaters this Halloween.

[147:21.76]When did it come out?
[147:22.30]I have no idea.
[147:32.44]Do end of the line.
[147:36.12]It's a Tron Knight, I think.
[147:38.68]End of the line.
[147:46.54]Tron.
[147:52.98]Okay.
[147:57.37]You should upload every single stream you've ever done as one video to your channel.
[148:04.93]I would crash your computer.
[148:07.53]How long would that be?
[148:09.62]I don't think you can even do that.
[148:13.12]You'd hit the maximum.
[148:13.88]What's the YouTube maximum?
[148:14.94]It's probably something not that long.
[148:20.97]Make the whole thing 144p.
[148:21.85]That would take so long.
[148:29.45]How big of a file would that be?
[148:31.05]I don't even know.
[148:33.17]I think some of you forget how long I've actually been doing this for.
[148:38.32]It's not just like four years.
[148:41.80]It's like 14 or like 12 or 13 or something.
[148:45.60]It'll be a long time.
[148:46.48]Alright, let's hear it.
[148:57.75]OK, sounds good.
[149:01.21]Make it a 16 bit video.
[149:10.59]Oh, everybody just collectively all went.
[149:13.39]Oh, same time.
[149:24.22]What the fuck happened?
[149:25.75]Oh, I had it with oh.
[149:28.53]I thought it was an orange.
[149:30.97]I thought it was an orange.
[149:32.89]Oh boy, this is not good.
[149:37.88]That's really unfortunate, but I might be able to save it right here.
[149:45.31]Yeah.
[149:47.55]Nice.
[149:47.85]Okay, I have to connect this shit.
[149:57.65]Get over there.
[150:00.31]Come on.
[150:02.27]Push!
[150:03.35]Push!
[150:05.19]Yeah!
[150:09.07]Okay, just gotta connect these.
[150:12.90]Scorpion, get over here.
[150:15.90]Come here!
[150:17.00]They still do that voice, by the way.
[150:19.34]I've played Mortal Kombat 1, and it's kind of a little jarring, where it's the same voice line, it sounds like, from the Genesis copy of the game.
[150:32.39]It's really interesting.
[150:33.47]It's like, whoa.
[150:34.39]It's like, whoa, you're taking me back.
[150:36.79]It's just like, like,
[150:45.67]it's like holy shit yay okay I got a pumpkin I win I call this with a win that was really loud oh it probably was
[151:11.36]Somebody said it sounded like Alex Jones.
[151:19.80]It sounded like J. Jonah Jameson.
[151:26.44]Spider-Man, I'm getting really sick and tired of not... He is destroying the city.
[151:31.62]I wish I could go over to him and say, get over... No.
[151:35.92]Get over here.
[151:39.11]That was the best one you've heard all night.
[151:52.69]So what do I do with this pumpkin?
[151:55.95]There's no music anymore.
[151:56.85]I feel like, what the fuck?
[152:01.63]Like, what the fuck is this?
[152:11.34]Usually, like, I have, like, songs playing.
[152:13.20]I was like, what the fuck?
[152:21.41]I don't know how to turn it on.
[152:22.93]I don't usually use the computer.
[152:26.01]Somebody helps me put stuff on.
[152:29.83]I don't answer my texts or anything.
[152:31.94]I don't know how to do it.
[152:35.52]Fuck.
[152:37.18]Fuck, dude.
[152:44.08]That was good.
[152:45.64]Tron Legacy, you got a good soundtrack.
[152:48.98]Um, this actually might be really good because there's not a whole lot of, uh, chappies.
[152:55.88]You know what I mean?
[152:56.42]And you got to really, you got to get ready to do that.
[152:58.48]You got to, your body has to move like three or four inches back and forth to do what I just did.
[153:04.23]Chappies.
[153:05.75]Um, so there's only a few of them.
[153:12.63]You're still streaming this?
[153:13.68]Yeah, we're just hanging out, man.
[153:18.24]I'm just going to do over here.
[153:22.38]Yeah.
[153:24.72]Yep.
[153:28.53]Anybody do anything interesting?
[153:32.95]I don't know.
[153:40.17]If those two touch, that'd be great.
[153:45.28]Just go back to Pluck.
[153:48.55]I could play Plock.
[153:53.41]That was a gamble.
[153:54.35]It did not pay off at all.
[154:00.07]Ooh, come on.
[154:01.85]Touch those.
[154:10.90]Shit.
[154:14.72]Ooh.
[154:16.36]That's okay.
[154:21.58]No, you little cherry shit.
[154:23.94]We're fine.
[154:34.25]I am not going to combine these yet.
[154:38.33]Okay, here we go.
[154:44.02]Yes.
[154:44.48]Okay.
[154:45.14]No.
[154:46.24]Somebody said the hitboxes were bullshit and they were right.
[154:50.70]Look at that.
[154:52.69]This could change everything.
[154:54.71]But I'm afraid to drop it here.
[154:56.05]If I drop it here, I don't think it's going to work.
[155:03.96]Should I just try to smush it?
[155:11.72]I would love it if I could just go right to the edge.
[155:13.34]Okay, I'm going to try it.
[155:19.11]Same problem.
[155:20.45]Different fruit.
[155:22.69]Too bad.
[155:23.17]Um.
[155:32.37]The same exact thing is going to happen.
[155:36.22]Or not.
[155:43.92]I need, yeah, something.
[155:44.58]I gotta put something on.
[155:45.56]We'll put the regular sounds on.
[155:48.97]Here, here's like the actual sound effects.
[155:51.82]It's been like three hours.
[155:53.08]I haven't heard him at all.
[155:59.84]I think I kind of screwed up big time.
[156:06.60]Wait.
[156:07.86]Look at the oranges at the bottom.
[156:10.29]They're so close to touching.
[156:12.79]Maybe I should just jiggle it.
[156:16.49]Should I just try to jiggle it and see what happens?
[156:25.37]Is that moving down?
[156:25.95]Ooh, it did.
[156:31.37]It did see a putty tat.
[156:38.26]I'll delete my channel after this.
[156:40.16]Like I, that was really, I'll delete my channel and my Twitter and like Discord and like everything.
[156:58.76]nobody can pull that off and I just proved it nobody I don't think I've ever heard anybody do that and neither of you and you've ever gone oh yeah can't wait to hear that again no one
[157:22.50]Really?
[157:22.90]Did that really just do that?
[157:25.04]That actually just happened to me.
[157:38.41]Dude.
[157:45.38]Good.
[157:47.64]This is kind of good.
[157:48.64]I'm OK with this.
[157:53.56]I think I'm gonna be alright.
[158:01.44]I need 2600!
[158:07.25]Stop giving me this crap!
[158:08.41]I need bigger stuff!
[158:14.31]Here we go.
[158:15.91]Um... I'm in trouble.
[158:26.41]This is the end of the line.
[158:27.25]This is it.
[158:35.42]I might just let it settle for a second because I might be able to get to like 24.
[158:42.20]If I can make... If I can get rid of the left side, then I might get a higher score than what I had before.
[158:51.31]But... Can I do that is the question.
[159:01.88]Well, that was... Ooh.
[159:05.19]Okay.
[159:07.53]This is rough, because it's gonna take this one.
[159:11.81]Maybe if I bounce it.
[159:16.69]That was not even the right fruit, and I need to get my eyes checked.
[159:21.60]Because I thought it was that one.
[159:26.89]I need to go to the doctor and say, I can't differentiate between an orange and whatever the fuck else this is.
[159:35.82]Doc.
[159:39.54]Hold on.
[159:45.90]It's an onion?
[159:46.82]It's not an onion.
[159:47.65]These are all fruits.
[159:49.77]It's not an onion.
[159:52.15]What is it?
[159:53.45]Is it a tangerine?
[159:58.46]I might be able to get higher if I... Okay, hold on.
[160:08.54]I'm gonna get higher than 2600, I think.
[160:15.47]I just gotta get it right.
[160:16.51]I don't... No.
[160:22.85]No, no, no, no, no.
[160:23.77]We're not doing that.
[160:31.55]Shit.
[160:32.83]Shit.
[160:35.65]Shit.
[160:38.03]Where do I even put this?
[160:41.95]Where do I even put it?
[160:47.41]It's possible if I just place things very gently to the point where I get another one of those oranges.
[161:00.87]oh oh no oh what the fuck I'm still in oh come on come on that would have been it too
[161:27.63]I'm surprised this game does not do a... like x5 or x10 speed kind of replay of what you did.
[161:37.31]It'll be DLC.
[161:40.10]That was fun.
[161:42.98]What time is it right now?
[161:43.98]9?
[161:45.00]Did I say I was gonna stream for 3 hours?
[161:47.56]You guys are gonna be mad at me, but I think that's probably it.
[161:51.52]I am going to... I'm going to implore you...
[161:56.16]Sunday, Sunday, this Sunday, go watch Doug Doug's channel.
[162:04.42]This is one of the first projects that I had a hand in for off-brand.
[162:11.99]Doug Doug's Shuffle Mania.
[162:13.07]It's going to be really fun.
[162:17.33]Definitely go check it out.
[162:21.27]Doug Doug is very, very funny.
[162:23.79]Doug Doug is awesome.
[162:26.60]Big show for Doug Doug.
[162:30.70]Go check it out Sunday at 1 p.m.
[162:35.52]Go check it out.
[162:38.49]Yeah, the mods will put it in the sauce.
[162:39.97]Just to remind you.
[162:40.95]You want to see it?
[162:44.07]When are you going to stream next?
[162:45.95]I will be live at some point next week.
[162:52.42]there's a lot of stuff I actually really want to play I want to do why are you aware I want to do um I want to play Lethal Company I keep hearing about it I've talked to people about it already so that I'll be it won't be like three weeks it's it'll be more like you know a week or so but I want to put warrior where's the first thing I'm going to play I really want to play it I forgot it came out
[163:21.71]But yeah, just whenever I feel like streaming it, whenever I feel like streaming, that's when you'll see it.
[163:27.22]I'll make sure that there is, you know, I'll tell you, obviously.
[163:30.94]Some point next week.
[163:33.34]But definitely go watch Doug Doug's show Sunday at 1 p.m.
[163:38.70]Telling you.
[163:40.03]Go check it out.
[163:47.59]At some point next year...
[163:53.25]Alright, good to see you.
[163:57.75]Have a good one.
[163:58.49]Take care of yourselves.
[164:08.72]Are you doing the awards this year?
[164:12.92]I don't want to disappoint everybody, but I think that's probably not going to happen this year.
[164:22.80]I think the amount of times I streamed and the amount of stuff that's happened this year, I've pulled back a lot.
[164:29.95]So I don't know how full a lot of the categories would be.
[164:32.61]But what I think would be fun to do is instead of doing a...
[164:38.50]a ton of categories and a ton of awards is just kind of hang out maybe maybe not even New Years or you know Christmas time I don't know let me just do like a little recap of some of the you know fun stuff that I thought was fun go over some of my favorite games of the year and stuff like that but I really don't know how much is there in 2023
[165:02.62]I didn't do like any major big event streams there was no I streamed you know once every week or two I I don't I would rather just remember that as something really really fun that we did for five six years in a row rather than go searching for clips that it ends up not being as interesting or as fun as any of the previous ones because we all know it's not hard to understand at this point
[165:30.44]we'd have to go, they would have, you'd have to go searching.
[165:36.63]And when you have to go reaching, I think it's probably not, it's probably time to not do it.
[165:44.94]But I think it'd be fun to just do like a hangout recap.
[165:47.72]That'd be fun.
[166:02.83]Yeah, this stuff, there's plenty of stuff to do.
[166:04.59]I just don't want that event to be, I don't know, like tarnished in a way because there's not enough.
[166:12.69]It's like, oh, this year, best gamer moment is two.
[166:21.28]Oh, like worst joke, best joke.
[166:23.60]There's like three options.
[166:28.24]Let's just remember the good times and continue to do the fun times.
[166:35.94]tarnished I said don't Netflix us I don't even know what that means
[167:02.13]You think you only did two good jokes this year?
[167:04.49]No, no, that's not what I mean.
[167:05.65]But in previous years, I was very active.
[167:09.64]Tons of shit, tons of shows, tons of opportunity to pull nominees from.
[167:18.60]You get it.
[167:23.33]Yeah, I'll see you guys next week.
[167:25.29]And definitely go watch Doug Doug's show on Sunday, 1 p.m.
[167:28.95]Pacific.
