[00:59.75]Hi, guys.
[01:00.61]Welcome.
[01:03.55]How's your Tuesday?
[01:06.49]Good.
[01:07.29]I'm glad to hear it.
[01:10.01]Tonight, we've got a couple of announcements.
[01:15.07]I'm going to stand on the podium.
[01:16.41]I'm going to make an announcement.
[01:19.17]Actually, we got two announcements.
[01:21.21]Whoa.
[01:22.52]What?
[01:27.86]Announcement number one.
[01:30.60]Uh, the polygraph stream.
[01:32.12]Wait, hold on.
[01:33.02]Shut up, Jeremy.
[01:33.84]Wait till you get, like, at least, like, a couple of humans in here.
[01:35.81]You know what I mean?
[01:38.33]Don't just... Don't... I just pressed the... Press play button.
[01:52.64]Alright, just give me... No, just enjoy the... Enjoy the screen for a minute.
[01:56.34]Up here.
[02:22.08]Okay.
[02:23.36]So.
[02:24.44]First things first.
[02:25.98]The Polygraph Stream announcement number one is set in stone.
[02:30.74]You will see that stream... Oh, what's that?
[02:32.59]Not like in two weeks.
[02:33.67]Not like in two months.
[02:35.59]Sunday.
[02:36.87]Sunday at 4.30 p.m.
[02:39.35]Eastern Time is the Polygraph Stream.
[02:43.36]Hope you enjoy it.
[02:44.18]Hope you watch.
[02:45.06]It's going to be fun.
[02:46.38]Make sure your questions are... I heard there are like a hundred questions.
[02:50.86]In the Discord that need to really be narrowed down.
[02:53.92]So, figure out what you want to ask.
[02:55.58]This is the only time it's going to happen.
[02:59.63]This Sunday.
[03:01.09]4.30pm.
[03:02.17]Eastern Time.
[03:03.49]You better fucking be there.
[03:06.27]No, I don't want to say that.
[03:07.87]You can come if you want.
[03:09.85]Announcement number two...
[03:11.92]This is not really an announcement, but I have, in fact, contacted Charlie.
[03:18.00]And I'm going to be on the official podcast very soon.
[03:22.34]So, there you go.
[03:23.74]I'm going to do it.
[03:24.38]It's going to be fun.
[03:25.58]Should be a lot of interesting conversations, I think.
[03:33.84]And announcement number three.
[03:35.99]Three announcements today.
[03:37.95]Yep.
[03:39.72]I'm pregnant.
[03:42.05]I'm pregnant.
[03:42.97]I'm the first male pregnancy.
[03:44.89]And the baby's due in about four days.
[03:47.45]So, I get Disney World.
[03:49.38]You understand?
[03:50.00]I get Disney World and I'm gonna sell it.
[03:52.84]The second they sign the deed over to me, when Walt Disney gives me the deed.
[03:59.22]Once that baby comes out of me, I get it.
[04:02.02]And I'm just going to sell it to the first person that offers me any money for it.
[04:05.77]And like, you know, EA is going to contact me.
[04:08.05]I guarantee you, you know, I guarantee you like, who's the company that makes all the Kelloggs, right?
[04:14.46]Kelloggs will probably give me an offer.
[04:17.72]Even if it's like 10 million dollars, just take it.
[04:20.10]And they're gonna turn Disney World into like the Kellogg's theme park.
[04:23.42]You'll have like Tony the Tiger rides.
[04:25.52]And honestly, not very much work would need to be, you know, if you're listening Kellogg's, not very much work would need to be involved.
[04:31.25]You would just need to take down a bunch of signs, because the rides can stay up.
[04:35.87]But just like repaint over Mickey Mouse's face with like the three little weirdos that make the snap, crackle, pop noises.
[04:46.02]Alright, we're gonna play Detroit Become Human.
[04:49.06]And we're gonna start it right now.
[04:52.30]So let's do it.
[04:55.68]I have no idea what this game is.
[04:57.72]All I know is it's a David Cage game.
[05:00.61]And they're very weird.
[05:01.87]And there's choices.
[05:02.93]And we're gonna make them.
[05:08.69]Detroit Become Human.
[05:18.29]Detroit become ResidentSleeper.
[05:20.95]Well, don't worry.
[05:21.83]If we resident sleep our way through this, I got Simpsons hit and run behind me.
[05:25.96]So if that's the... I shouldn't have said that.
[05:28.56]Here we go.
[05:29.14]Look, Quantum Dream.
[05:29.92]Remember that?
[05:32.12]That was an Xbox game.
[05:32.98]Should I turn it up?
[05:42.30]Look at those 3D graphics.
[05:44.96]Those are some really nice, like, 3D teeth.
[05:46.68]This is the best 3D teeth I've ever seen.
[05:49.00]Wait, what are they doing?
[05:50.70]Wait, you're gonna Psycho Mantis my console right now?
[05:52.74]I don't want you to do that.
[05:54.12]I don't want you to, like, open up my porn tabs.
[06:08.15]That's how my computer is.
[06:09.43]Okay, I don't know if I like this.
[06:11.73]English is fine.
[06:12.49]English is fine.
[06:13.23]Subtitles on.
[06:13.91]Subtitles small.
[06:14.71]That's okay.
[06:15.09]You guys can handle that.
[06:16.95]Usually I have a Bitcoin meter where it shows all the Bitcoin stuff.
[06:22.45]The trends in the market.
[06:24.29]And then 200 porn tabs.
[06:26.55]That's it.
[06:26.81]That's the only thing I use my computer for.
[06:33.29]Is that me?
[06:39.15]Alright, uh, adjust value until center icon is barely visible.
[06:44.11]Not visible and then barely visible.
[06:46.70]That's fine.
[06:47.44]That looks alright.
[06:48.82]0.10.
[06:53.20]The controller makes noise in this game.
[06:55.82]Alright, we already had two, like, sexual jokes.
[07:00.28]Like, let me just, like, pretend like I didn't do that.
[07:02.92]I want immersive gameplay with advanced controls.
[07:05.04]A fair challenge where mistakes can mean losing a character.
[07:09.56]I want to focus on the stor- no, no, no, no.
[07:12.40]We are experienced.
[07:14.04]I've played a video game before in my life.
[07:15.56]That's it.
[07:18.52]Experienced.
[07:21.68]Settings will automatically re- yeah, keep experienced.
[07:23.46]I know.
[07:32.73]Remember, this is not just a story.
[07:35.68]I thought she said this is not scary.
[07:37.16]This is our future.
[07:38.90]Is this one of those games where they're going to be taking pictures of me or something?
[07:41.18]I don't have a PlayStation camera plugged in.
[07:42.76]Good.
[07:46.44]August 25th, 2038.
[07:49.06]Outside McDonald's.
[07:56.51]Fucking sick.
[07:57.17]I didn't know Two-Face was in this game.
[08:00.97]It's Harvey Dent.
[08:04.30]Delete that from the record.
[08:08.64]Those are pretty cool tricks, though.
[08:13.77]So I have a negotiator.
[08:17.67]A negotiator RK800.
[08:19.17]Do I walk?
[08:20.91]I do.
[08:21.11]Okay.
[08:21.25]Well, the game looks really good.
[08:27.19]What's that?
[08:30.06]What is that?
[08:30.38]No, no, I didn't get to do it in time.
[08:35.43]We're going to talk about find Captain Allen, but what's the thing on the ground here?
[08:43.83]Kneel down.
[08:44.45]Interact using the right stick.
[08:55.21]Did I just stomp on a fish?
[08:56.25]Okay, okay.
[08:56.77]That's a dwarf Gorami.
[09:00.05]Choose by performing the right movement.
[09:02.91]Save?
[09:03.21]Okay, I'm going to save the fish.
[09:04.29]Why wouldn't I save the fish?
[09:08.46]This thing's going to come back.
[09:10.04]Once the big, giant monster comes and attacks me.
[09:14.48]Outside of the building, the dog's going to come.
[09:16.04]The fish is going to save me when I fight the giant Goron guy.
[09:21.04]Anything else I can do?
[09:24.30]Eat the fish.
[09:24.90]No, this is just teaching you how to do things.
[09:31.30]Hold R2 to consult your objectives.
[09:34.44]Find Captain Allen.
[09:35.34]Okay, that's all I can do.
[09:40.00]Can I do anything else?
[09:44.76]Oh wait, I'm not programmed to do that because I'm an android.
[09:48.72]Okay, I get it.
[09:49.22]Nothing else I can do?
[09:50.55]Fine.
[09:51.03]He's right here.
[09:53.60]There he is.
[09:58.28]Alright, Captain.
[10:00.10]Captain Allen, my name is Connor.
[10:02.67]I'm the android sent by CyberLife.
[10:06.49]That's a cool decal on his back.
[10:07.85]It's firing at everything that moves.
[10:09.91]It already shot down two of my men.
[10:12.48]We could easily get it, but they're on the edge of the balcony.
[10:15.20]If it falls, she falls.
[10:19.23]That's cool, I like that.
[10:19.99]Okay, Deviant's name.
[10:21.28]What's the Deviant's name?
[10:22.00]Emotional shock, deactivation code.
[10:23.56]What's the Deviant's name?
[10:24.66]Do you know its name?
[10:27.02]I haven't got a clue.
[10:28.28]Does it matter?
[10:28.81]I need information to determine the best approach.
[10:33.38]Uh... Is he in shock?
[10:35.82]Turn the volume up?
[10:41.44]Alright, that works.
[10:44.24]Okay, so I have to deactivate the android.
[10:49.82]I have a 48% probability of success?
[10:52.96]What the hell are you talking about?
[10:53.95]Understand- Save all hostages at all costs.
[10:55.71]What the hell is going on?
[10:58.17]How am I gonna- Save the hostages, I guess.
[11:00.05]What?
[11:03.47]Locate the host... Save the... Okay, I'm gonna save the hostages.
[11:13.46]Uh, search hostages rooms.
[11:15.98]Locate the hostages... Alright, well... Is this a hostage room?
[11:20.98]Alright, what's in here?
[11:21.64]Alright, we got examine.
[11:26.66]Let's see what's on their iPod.
[11:30.25]Swipe the touchpad to interact.
[11:39.57]The father and children now.
[11:43.12]Okay, his name's Daniel.
[11:46.76]What, he killed somebody?
[11:50.16]Not quite human.
[11:50.90]Okay, Daniel.
[11:54.02]Okay, now I got a 54% chance.
[11:55.92]You unlocked a dialog or action, often beneficial.
[11:59.34]Okay, anything else in here that I can do?
[12:03.71]Don't think so.
[12:09.66]Calm down.
[12:10.42]Easy.
[12:13.16]I could go in here.
[12:16.02]Look at it.
[12:19.70]Go sleep on the bed.
[12:20.51]I'm an android.
[12:21.01]You don't have to sleep as an android.
[12:22.13]There's nothing in there.
[12:27.19]I do have some extra info though.
[12:29.27]Every second counts.
[12:30.55]How do I sprint?
[12:34.63]Oh shit, the guy's going to jump off the... Oh god.
[12:37.70]Examine the victims.
[12:38.64]Oh my god, okay.
[12:39.32]I didn't know there was a guy standing out there.
[12:41.70]Quickly.
[12:46.34]Use the right stick to move the cursor.
[12:48.47]Analyze.
[12:48.93]Okay, he's got a bloody nose.
[12:51.59]No, there we go.
[12:52.15]Okay, his eyeball.
[12:55.69]Deceased.
[12:56.15]John Phillips.
[12:57.13]Six feet, weight 172 pounds.
[12:59.17]That's not how much he weighs.
[13:00.44]He died at 7.30 p.m.
[13:03.60]What else we got?
[13:04.08]Come on.
[13:04.38]Every second counts.
[13:05.48]Bullet wounds, right?
[13:10.36]355 bullet wounds in his lungs.
[13:11.80]He's been shot that many times.
[13:12.96]Must have been a really big gun.
[13:15.04]He's hemorrhaging.
[13:18.48]Left kidney perforated.
[13:20.42]Fatal abdominal trauma.
[13:23.36]And... One more here.
[13:27.87]Lower lung hemorrhage.
[13:28.95]Reconstruct.
[13:29.51]Reconstruct.
[13:33.60]Now we can figure out how he died.
[13:34.56]Use L2 or R2 to review reconstruction?
[13:37.36]Alright, every second counts.
[13:43.85]Hold on, where did he get shot?
[13:45.99]Okay, he got shot.
[13:48.39]One time.
[13:49.85]Twice.
[13:50.15]Okay, now I can analyze this part.
[13:53.61]I can look into his past.
[13:55.42]Father was holding something.
[13:56.56]The iPod.
[13:57.30]Rewind to search for a new clue.
[14:04.45]Okay, so he was holding an iPad.
[14:07.33]And then... And then... There's a guy with a gun standing there.
[14:14.74]There he is.
[14:16.42]Okay.
[14:22.14]So, how do I identify the man with the gun?
[14:25.27]You know, every second counts here.
[14:30.67]Move the camera.
[14:31.39]Can I look at the thing he has?
[14:36.65]Where did he go?
[14:37.13]He threw it over there.
[14:38.81]Okay.
[14:41.40]Reconstruct the iPad.
[14:44.30]Is that it?
[14:46.54]Anything else you need me to do?
[14:47.40]Okay, I got it, right?
[14:53.98]Events analyzed.
[14:54.58]Yeah, exit.
[14:55.00]Get out.
[14:55.26]Now go look at the iPad.
[14:57.52]The iPad's over here.
[15:10.70]Okay.
[15:11.00]Interesting.
[15:13.52]You've unlocked a dialog or action.
[15:21.75]Okay.
[15:23.53]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[15:26.43]Hold on, hold on.
[15:27.01]I'm at a D-, I'm at a D-.
[15:28.15]I'm almost... Wait, something on the ground over there.
[15:32.71]Just hit him with, like, rubber bullets for a few minutes.
[15:37.58]Get in there.
[15:38.14]There's like a VR system over here.
[15:39.30]Get it.
[15:41.48]Listen to it.
[15:47.16]What's on it?
[15:49.34]The child didn't hear gunshots.
[15:55.53]Alright, we're getting closer.
[15:58.74]So, examine hostages' room.
[16:01.28]Search, examine the victims.
[16:03.04]There's one more victim over there.
[16:05.07]I gotta locate the hostages though.
[16:06.91]Where is the actual sprint button?
[16:10.29]There's another guy over there.
[16:12.61]Hey, will you move this way?
[16:16.35]There's an officer down over here.
[16:19.19]Yeah, there's a bunch of... There's so many things in here!
[16:21.71]Okay, quickly.
[16:23.35]Get over to him.
[16:24.29]Analyze him.
[16:26.25]This is the first responder.
[16:32.44]deceased.
[16:33.62]Died at 8.
[16:34.60]So he came in after the guy over there was killed.
[16:37.55]He came in at 8 o'clock.
[16:40.27]Got a thing put in his ear.
[16:44.85]Hang it up.
[16:46.31]Right heart, ventricle perforated, internal bleeding.
[16:49.51]And what else?
[16:49.89]Was he holding something?
[16:51.19]A photo of someone?
[16:54.51]Is there one more thing?
[16:55.27]What is it?
[16:57.53]I already got that.
[17:00.09]Come on, what else is there?
[17:00.83]Something in his hand?
[17:01.75]Right there.
[17:05.07]Gunshot residue.
[17:06.11]Lead.
[17:06.69]Stiphonate.
[17:07.69]Antimony.
[17:08.21]Sulfide.
[17:08.93]One shot only.
[17:10.15]Let's find out what happened to this guy.
[17:17.65]Alright, he got shot by... This guy.
[17:22.28]Found something in the ground.
[17:24.76]There's a shoe over there.
[17:26.14]Hostage witnessed the shooting.
[17:29.44]And there's also... There's the gun.
[17:32.52]Cop shot the deviant.
[17:35.07]And there's one last thing here.
[17:39.39]What is this, gun and go fly over here?
[17:43.45]There's his weapon underneath.
[17:44.33]Okay, I gotta go underneath there.
[17:49.78]Pick up the weapon.
[17:53.26]Come on, almost there.
[17:56.79]No, don't assault.
[17:57.75]Do not assault yet.
[17:59.29]Why would you bring the funny, weird android detective in?
[18:02.80]Put it back or take it.
[18:04.44]Androids are strictly forbidden to carry or use any weapon type.
[18:08.94]What?
[18:09.30]Okay, hold on.
[18:10.62]Oh, every second counts.
[18:11.60]Take it.
[18:16.41]I might need that.
[18:16.97]Okay, we've got something right here.
[18:23.51]Look at that.
[18:23.85]Look at the magazine.
[18:26.25]More androids, less work.
[18:27.46]Cyber life and androids.
[18:28.50]Okay.
[18:31.44]We're running out of time here.
[18:34.88]Check the shoe.
[18:35.79]Alright, collected the data.
[18:40.23]She stepped on something.
[18:42.31]Or he stepped on something.
[18:44.21]Officers could be wounded.
[18:48.47]Alright.
[18:49.65]75% chance to succeed.
[18:50.55]And is there anything else?
[18:52.09]Except one more thing here.
[18:53.17]And then I'm done.
[18:58.67]That's the android fluid.
[19:01.94]Fresh blue blood.
[19:03.58]The android... Okay, so they both might be wounded.
[19:05.04]He's a PL-600.
[19:07.08]I'm an RK-800.
[19:08.32]We're so... We've got way more Wi-Fi range.
[19:10.46]And there's a pot right here.
[19:13.82]This is it.
[19:14.16]Then I'm going to be done.
[19:16.45]Get down.
[19:17.55]Go.
[19:17.73]Go.
[19:21.94]Quick, analyze the pasta.
[19:23.36]Analyze the pasta, quick!
[19:26.24]Family was about to have dinner.
[19:29.77]Okay, time to go in.
[19:31.41]I got a C+.
[19:31.93]Okay, gentlemen.
[19:37.13]I'll be going outside.
[19:37.81]Uh... Did I do it?
[19:45.70]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[19:50.26]Okay, I gotta think fast here.
[19:56.15]He is very good at standing there.
[19:57.41]Name.
[19:57.97]I know his name.
[19:58.85]Oh, no.
[19:59.81]Do I have to walk forward?
[20:01.13]Wait, hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[20:02.62]Why would you do that?
[20:03.30]Why would you do that?
[20:19.62]I'm in the middle of negotiating and he's standing like a trapeze artist.
[20:23.32]Alright, let's calm him down.
[20:25.31]I know you're angry, Daniel.
[20:26.53]Look around.
[20:27.99]But you need to trust me and let me help you.
[20:30.89]I don't want your help.
[20:32.23]Okay.
[20:32.57]Nobody can help me.
[20:33.67]Yellow means I'm scared.
[20:34.89]All I want is for all this to stop.
[20:36.79]Alright, I'm going to call the helicopter and say, shut up.
[20:41.27]Alright, easy.
[20:42.33]Are you armed?
[20:43.17]Easy.
[20:43.91]Oh, shit.
[20:44.47]No, I am.
[20:44.90]Yes, I am.
[20:45.64]Yes.
[20:46.92]I have a gun.
[20:48.25]I shouldn't have said that.
[20:50.09]Alright, I'm gonna drop it.
[20:51.95]Drop the gun.
[20:57.09]See?
[20:57.63]I'm good.
[21:00.75]Emma and you.
[21:01.33]Possible cause.
[21:03.21]Let's talk about you and the girl.
[21:06.83]And I know that I'm a much better model than you.
[21:08.39]Does that anger you?
[21:08.95]Easy.
[21:09.17]Nice and slow.
[21:20.91]I know.
[21:21.57]I am also not one of those humans.
[21:24.21]Somebody put a table here, so it's really kind of hard to do this.
[21:28.18]Let's do probable cause.
[21:29.36]I don't like... Okay, I got a 91%.
[21:30.94]Let's get close here.
[21:31.62]Easy.
[21:32.98]Not that bad.
[21:33.52]Something to throw away when you're done with it.
[21:47.16]Okay.
[21:49.16]Sympathetic.
[21:49.94]I'm also an android.
[21:51.62]I can relate to it.
[21:52.12]Got it.
[21:52.32]97%.
[21:52.34]DS Clayton.
[22:19.05]I can't stand that noise anymore.
[22:22.21]Tell that helicopter to get out of here.
[22:26.10]Yeah, get out of here.
[22:28.86]The situation is under control.
[22:31.08]We're under control.
[22:33.62]Don't worry, I got it.
[22:34.90]I'm gonna walk over there, I'm gonna get the girl.
[22:40.54]100%.
[22:41.94]Okay, trust me.
[22:43.06]You have to trust me, Daniel.
[22:45.20]Let the hostage go and I promise you everything will be fine.
[22:50.73]I want everyone to leave!
[22:52.46]And I want a car.
[22:56.46]When I'm outside the city, I'll let her go.
[22:58.08]That's impossible, Daniel.
[22:59.97]Let the girl go, and I promise you won't be hurt.
[23:10.97]If I get a 1% failure here, I'm gonna laugh.
[23:18.19]Reassure.
[23:18.81]The android negotiation game.
[23:25.38]This is when... This is when he gets... He gets shunked right in the head by a sniper rifle.
[23:35.31]He called you.
[23:42.80]Into the trash.
[23:43.98]You lied to me, Connor.
[23:53.11]Software instability.
[23:54.23]You lied to me.
[23:59.93]Did my job.
[24:07.35]Mission success.
[24:11.27]Fair but firm.
[24:15.33]Realistic with low expectations.
[24:23.05]Title card.
[24:26.91]This is the scene's flowchart.
[24:29.05]Here you can review the paths you've taken, the paths yet to be explored, and what possibilities you've unlocked.
[24:34.67]Each node earns you points that you can spend in the extras.
[24:38.42]Due to the nature of the game, subnodes and endings will not be counted towards the completion of the flowchart.
[24:44.21]What the hell is this?
[24:47.17]Snipers shot Deviant.
[24:50.27]Bill Truss lied to Deviant.
[24:54.31]So you can negotiate with Deviant.
[24:58.51]Okay, see there's one, two, three, four, five.
[25:01.63]There's five potential outcomes here.
[25:04.91]Okay.
[25:08.17]I think we got the best one.
[25:11.53]What about the stats of the world?
[25:14.05]really only 33 of everybody that's played this has done this go back and do it alright we're gonna go back and do it again until I get every single one now here's the whole stream we're just gonna do the tutorial over and over again that's cool looks like pretty much everybody dismisses the helicopter oddly enough nobody's honest about the gun
[25:43.14]Get close enough.
[25:44.60]That's interesting.
[25:45.28]Okay.
[25:48.14]That's cool that they do that.
[25:49.76]Sort of like Telltale, but way better.
[25:55.00]Cyberlife Incorporated.
[25:57.72]Loading operating system.
[26:07.29]This is the top of the range household assistant.
[26:10.46]It's probably because it's the E3 demo.
[26:12.01]Come on, Zoe.
[26:12.57]Let's go.
[26:12.95]I'm interested.
[26:13.65]Look around.
[26:14.09]So I'm the thing for sale.
[26:15.73]This is the Verizon store of the future.
[26:25.50]Can I burp and shit?
[26:26.84]I know.
[26:27.34]If I walked into a Verizon store, they were selling people like this.
[26:30.28]First one that burped in my face, I would be like, I want that one.
[26:32.15]What's the plan?
[26:32.55]Yeah, these motherfuckers aren't even 4G.
[26:33.43]I am.
[26:33.53]Can I walk?
[26:33.81]What if I just walked off?
[26:56.20]Come along and I'll show you.
[26:58.58]You can buy somebody for $8,000.
[27:00.04]Yeah, that seems a little cheap.
[27:03.37]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[27:04.15]Not the gross guy.
[27:04.71]Not the gross fat guy.
[27:05.69]It was a bit difficult getting it back in working order.
[27:08.75]It was really messed up.
[27:10.73]What'd you say happened to it again?
[27:12.91]The car hit it.
[27:14.39]Stupid accident.
[27:15.05]God damn it.
[27:16.53]See?
[27:17.73]Anyway, it's as good as new now.
[27:19.76]Except that we had to reset it.
[27:21.52]Meaning we had to wipe its memory.
[27:23.50]I hope you don't mind.
[27:24.22]It'll be fine.
[27:25.84]This guy's probably doing something fucking weird.
[27:32.37]AX400 is... Name is... Dave.
[27:36.71]Kara.
[27:37.77]My name is Kara.
[27:38.87]I'm a man, actually.
[27:40.65]I was wrong.
[27:42.02]Sorry about that.
[27:43.02]Deleted from memory.
[27:56.13]Seems interesting.
[27:56.71]I like it.
[28:02.09]Jacks.
[28:02.45]Cities of the future always have, for some reason, I don't know why, because it's never going to happen, gigantic screens with huge 5,000-foot LED displays that just play advertisements.
[28:23.45]That's never going to happen.
[28:25.40]You know how much electricity it would cost to have a 5,000-foot building TV?
[28:32.82]No, that's impractical.
[28:37.87]Yeah, Times Square exists, but Times Square, you're talking about maybe 50 to 100 inches.
[28:42.63]Not 10,000 feet tall buildings.
[28:48.89]For some reason, everybody thinks in the future that only advertisements are gonna play all over the city.
[28:56.53]In every direction you're gonna turn, there's gonna be advertisements everywhere.
[28:59.17]It's not gonna happen.
[29:15.26]50 to 100 inches.
[29:16.02]That's like the TV in your living room right now.
[29:30.27]But not every city and every building is going to be like that.
[29:34.57]You're talking about Times Square, you're talking about one city that is an annoying city with a ton of loud noises in it.
[29:40.35]People go to Times Square for, like, a joke, and to, like, go on vacation with their family, and to be, like, a stockbroker.
[29:47.81]Down in, like, the suburb of Kentucky, there's not gonna be 10 million TV screens showing Colgate commercials.
[29:56.21]Would you like to go home now?
[29:58.27]Yes.
[29:59.27]Yes, I think that's enough.
[30:01.28]No, I did not just call New York a joke.
[30:03.50]I love New York.
[30:04.21]No, people go to New York for all kinds.
[30:10.89]Look, I'm going to read this guy's diary.
[30:12.27]Everyone calm down.
[30:14.89]Teeth addict.
[30:16.23]Secrets of androids.
[30:17.25]How cyber life designs its androids to coexist with humans.
[30:20.93]VR MMORPG reaches 1 billion users.
[30:24.08]Alright, this is page 1.
[30:26.92]Oh.
[30:33.66]Can I not move?
[30:36.69]Swipe?
[30:37.15]Oh, it's touchpad, right.
[30:38.21]Okay.
[30:40.07]Green Earth.
[30:41.73]Climate change.
[30:43.31]Up.
[30:46.68]Miami to heightened sea wall by 10 meters.
[30:49.36]Whatever.
[30:51.18]Climate change up.
[30:53.83]Page 2.
[30:54.52]Prices.
[30:55.04]There's a lot of information here you could read if you really wanted to.
[30:57.56]You could read page 2 if you wanted.
[31:00.96]Coastal properties are not just exposed to flooding anymore.
[31:03.08]I mean, you could read page 3 if you really cared.
[31:09.25]Yeah, paper doesn't exist in the future.
[31:10.61]There's a bunch of expensive tablets around.
[31:12.39]Who's paying for this?
[31:14.20]That was my point all along, guys.
[31:16.26]Who's paying for all this?
[31:19.41]You know how much debt the United States is in right now?
[31:21.49]You think we're going to be able to afford, instead of newspapers, we're going to be able to afford iPads everywhere?
[31:27.48]Your tax dollars going to cover this shit?
[31:33.70]We'll be lucky if every city has clean water in 20 years.
[31:39.13]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[31:40.21]I thought it was like, don't grab baby.
[31:41.87]I was like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[31:46.45]Alright, go to the, go to the pant shop.
[31:48.59]The paint shop.
[31:53.72]You have 12 miles.
[31:54.66]Can I interact with you?
[31:59.68]Just gotta go to the paint store.
[32:03.10]Oh, that guy accidentally bumped into that lady.
[32:04.98]How do I do the bump into the lady run?
[32:08.81]Wait for green light.
[32:10.55]Do I actually have to do that?
[32:12.75]Am I actually programmed to follow the rules of the road?
[32:16.67]Where is this place?
[32:17.39]Oh, there's something over there.
[32:20.11]Retrieve order at Bellany Paints.
[32:25.44]I mean, I guess we gotta go this way.
[32:29.20]Can I not just... No jaywalking?
[32:34.07]I can't.
[32:34.71]Anybody else over here I can interact with?
[32:38.81]I don't want to just blow through this.
[32:40.43]Shit.
[32:41.31]Shit.
[32:45.74]Red's the new green.
[32:46.62]Look at that.
[32:47.00]Look at how much money that costed.
[32:50.94]Use the GPS.
[32:52.26]It was down this way, right?
[32:53.56]Wasn't there something behind me here?
[32:55.57]I thought there was a little yellow suitcase over there to the left.
[33:00.87]I don't know what I can do.
[33:23.64]We are playing God by creating machines, but we are not God.
[33:28.52]We are nothing but dust.
[33:32.38]Why do you look at me so demon?
[33:35.57]I know who you are.
[33:38.15]I can see through you.
[33:40.51]You are the one by whom the evil will come.
[33:44.10]You are the one who will destroy Detroit.
[33:47.94]Now stop talking about all the electricity and stuff.
[33:50.24]Bail me out here.
[33:52.63]We make these androids in our own image.
[33:56.13]There's no fierce right hook, is there?
[34:03.01]It's too late for that.
[34:04.73]What do you mean?
[34:09.66]No, it's not this way.
[34:10.76]I just want to look.
[34:11.78]I can't go on random paint stores.
[34:16.97]I want to go on random storefronts.
[34:18.83]I feel like it'd be fun.
[34:20.75]This thing on conversations.
[34:25.19]Alright, going in.
[34:35.08]Got all kinds of different cool candles here.
[34:36.72]Alright, I got an order.
[34:37.50]Create your own colors.
[34:43.53]Okay.
[34:44.99]Identification verified.
[34:49.76]this is the why the paint store is all candles here is your order number 847 that will be 63.99 please confirm payment alright this is important because I want to know if this is on the blockchain or not yeah payment confirmed look at how fast that was that you're talking that you're talking about I you know I bet you I never mind
[35:18.98]Never mind, never mind.
[35:20.00]I was gonna... ...do a bunch of fucking cryptocurrency dog shit, but we've heard that so many times.
[35:28.80]Use R1 to switch the camera angle.
[35:33.65]Looks like... who's that looking for a dollar?
[35:35.27]This guy?
[35:36.11]Let me help this guy.
[35:39.41]Let me, like, deposit into this guy's SegWit address.
[35:44.61]No?
[35:49.64]Alright, let's go.
[35:54.94]Take the bus home.
[35:56.86]Couldn't he just walk?
[35:57.66]He's gonna spend it on PlayStation 2 games.
[36:08.36]Alright, where's the bus?
[36:09.94]This is the bus right here.
[36:12.20]We all have to stand in like a chicken coop?
[36:16.23]What the hell was that?
[36:18.07]She just tapped that person.
[36:19.17]Wait, do you get like a personal bag holder?
[36:21.33]That's what we are.
[36:24.33]Temporary android parking.
[36:28.24]Yeah.
[36:29.46]So this is what replaces those Walmart wagons that you ride in with like the wheels and the thing that's like the cart that you drive.
[36:36.50]You can just have one of these androids hold your kid on his back.
[36:41.98]What's over there?
[36:42.48]I'm just interested in looking around.
[36:45.99]This is the best.
[36:52.65]We want jobs, not androids.
[36:57.23]Uh-oh.
[37:01.49]Hey guys, check it out.
[37:02.25]We got one of those tin cans here.
[37:05.47]I took their job.
[37:06.83]Look at this little motherfucker.
[37:09.59]What job did I take?
[37:12.71]I'm delivering a glorified pizza.
[37:15.14]What are you talking about?
[37:15.88]Get up.
[37:21.60]You really want to deliver fucking paint shit to somebody?
[37:27.91]Job stealer.
[37:34.83]Give me my job at the paint store back!
[37:38.47]Do it!
[37:39.27]Alright.
[37:39.55]That's enough.
[37:43.67]Leave it alone.
[37:46.40]Let us teach this bastard a lesson.
[37:50.65]If you damage it, I'm gonna have to fine you.
[37:53.11]You can take your job next.
[37:57.86]See how you like it.
[38:00.76]Okay.
[38:02.42]Excuse me, I was supposed to be delivering this.
[38:09.90]I want my job back as a grocery holder.
[38:13.27]Alright, wait for the bus.
[38:22.26]A lot of interesting stuff going on, though.
[38:24.17]Wait, what do you do?
[38:26.45]Oh, I cannot.
[38:26.87]You have to hold it.
[38:27.65]Okay.
[38:29.39]Wasn't sure about it for a minute.
[38:36.46]Wait, this is probably what's going to happen.
[38:40.16]Come on in.
[38:49.77]Do the android compartments stand there?
[38:53.17]Do they have a separate Android bus compartment?
[38:58.47]It's like, okay.
[39:04.98]That's really weird.
[39:07.22]At least make the... Alright, I...
[39:10.71]you want some commentary here if you didn't make them look like people then it wouldn't be a big deal you know make them look like c-3po and they'll be jokey and funny nobody'll get mad for the jobs that are being stolen and have them have the funny robot voice you're making them like people no make them have look funny androids you can customize your own funny android uh can I not can I do something else besides take the bus
[39:47.21]World stats.
[39:47.89]Is there something else you could even do?
[39:48.93]Apparently not.
[39:51.57]There are a couple other things you could have done.
[39:54.45]Preacher yells at you.
[40:03.67]You don't want to have sex with a funny android.
[40:06.22]Oh my god.
[40:09.30]No, but that's how you could combat that kind of fucked up shit.
[40:12.22]Have them have goofy faces and big heads and...
[40:15.44]Have them talk like this.
[40:16.52]Yes, sir.
[40:17.10]Excuse me, sir.
[40:19.26]Are you really going to go, like, be like, hey, you took my job, asshole, when he's like, excuse me, sir.
[40:23.01]Well, I, unfortunately, I'm programmed only to do my work.
[40:26.97]You're going to laugh.
[40:27.51]You're going to be like, he's so funny.
[40:30.17]I love these funny guys.
[40:31.69]You're not going to care.
[40:42.66]Switch the camera angle.
[40:45.24]John Todd.
[40:46.34]Join Todd.
[40:47.50]You coming?
[40:49.82]Yeah, well, hold on one minute, sir.
[40:52.78]I'm currently enjoying the landscape.
[40:56.62]The gigantic 5,000-foot LED screen.
[41:01.09]The future.
[41:03.17]Okay, I say top it.
[41:15.77]You've been gone for two weeks, so the place is a mess.
[41:19.25]You do the housework, the washing, you cook the meals, and you take care of... God damn it, where the fuck's the brat gone now?
[41:27.35]See, yeah, you just don't make them a person.
[41:29.29]Alice!
[41:30.82]Why does everybody want to do that?
[41:31.84]Oh, there you are.
[41:32.48]From Westworld to Detroit to become human.
[41:33.98]That's Alice.
[41:34.44]Look after her.
[41:35.78]Homework, bath, all that crap.
[41:38.82]If this was a bright, shiny, metal person... Get started down here, then you do upstairs.
[41:45.78]It's gotta be people.
[41:48.28]And we have to make them as smart as us, too.
[41:51.56]Why would you do that?
[41:52.56]Why would you want that?
[41:53.96]See, we have to make them as intelligent or more intelligent than we currently are.
[41:57.17]What are you thinking?
[41:58.13]You're just making better humans.
[41:59.53]Are you crazy?
[42:01.53]Inside of all of us, guys, there's a bunch of goo and organs and squishy shit.
[42:06.95]We're replacing that with stuff that never has to be replaced.
[42:09.34]And we want to make them smarter than us?
[42:11.36]Why are we making humans 2.0?
[42:12.88]What's wrong with everybody?
[42:15.56]No, have them like Tin Man and drop their IQ by 40 points and make them just pick up our grocery bags.
[42:29.71]Alright, we have urgent tasks.
[42:30.73]We collect the dishes, activate the vacuum cleaner, check the backyard.
[42:33.41]Alright, the urgent tasks are collect the trash.
[42:41.78]Okay, I'm pretty bad at this.
[42:43.04]Collect trash.
[42:47.40]There's nothing in this.
[42:50.93]I wasn't programmed with this shit.
[42:52.49]Hold on, there's more trash.
[42:53.95]Yeah.
[42:56.41]Wait, am I throwing plates away?
[42:59.09]Maybe.
[43:00.91]Oh, no, this one doesn't work that well.
[43:03.86]This one's throwing away glass plates.
[43:05.52]You're not recycling.
[43:07.12]Yeah, yeah.
[43:08.60]Oh, God.
[43:09.22]Yeah, yeah.
[43:14.58]This is the equivalent of sliding your hand across the table.
[43:17.26]Like, clean the coffee table.
[43:19.36]Anything else I got in here?

[43:21.34]No.
[43:24.86]Alright, let's go.
[43:25.40]Alright, what hockey game is he watching, I wonder?
[43:35.33]Recycle that stuff.
[43:37.33]Wow.
[43:38.85]Unbelievable.
[43:39.53]Those pizza boxes could have been recycled.
[43:49.37]Take out the trash Credit card application rejected Invoice note overdrawn notice.
[44:00.03]This is okay.
[44:00.67]This guy doesn't have it.
[44:01.35]So how did how could you afford a $8,000 robot?
[44:15.38]See you.
[44:17.76]I'm going rogue.
[44:21.30]Drop bags in the container.
[44:22.40]God damn it.
[44:22.86]I can't like go talk to this guy with trash.
[44:24.62]I can't just carry the trash around for the rest of the game.
[44:28.23]A better place to live.

[44:33.63]That's another thing too.
[44:34.53]Like take a look.
[44:36.15]In the future guys.
[44:36.95]There's 50,000 foot LED screens everywhere.
[44:40.10]And nuclear power plant exhaust gas everywhere too.
[44:44.36]That's what happens.
[44:53.28]Alright, took out the trash.
[44:57.86]Wait, did we get 50 million bits?
[44:59.20]Oh my god, we did.
[45:01.18]Hold on, can I pause it?
[45:03.14]Yeah.
[45:04.78]Polo Juice came in with $100.

[45:09.52]100 bucks.
[45:12.48]$100 for the most exciting gameplay on Twitch.
[45:16.96]Well, thank you.
[45:17.58]I appreciate the $100.
[45:19.98]That might have been a little tongue-in-cheek there.
[45:21.42]You might have been saying that as a, uh, got-ya.
[45:24.56]And I would turn the webcam on to give you, like, that gay, but I don't have any clothes on, so no.
[45:30.76]I'm being as raw as a human as I can.
[45:33.34]You understand?
[45:35.16]No shirt, no pants.
[45:36.80]Because I'm a real person, and that's how I... When I sit here in my rawest form and play this game.
[45:44.88]Thank you, Polo Juice, for the $100.
[45:48.27]Much appreciated, dude.
[45:49.95]Yeah, we have more tasks to complete.
[45:54.52]Fuck, man.
[45:55.60]Took out the trash.
[45:56.22]Report to Todd.
[45:56.90]Oh, there's more stuff to do.
[45:59.24]Collect the dishes.
[45:59.94]Activate the vacuum cleaner.
[46:00.90]Check the vacuum... Let's... Dishes.
[46:04.88]What, did he cut his hand or something?
[46:08.78]No, he's just smoking crack.
[46:10.48]Whatever the hell he's doing.
[46:11.18]Okay.
[46:11.66]Wash the dishes.
[46:17.48]Um...
[46:19.69]Okay, apparently a iPad caught my interest for some reason.
[46:23.58]Why?
[46:28.68]What's going on here?
[46:33.72]What the fuck is that?
[46:37.31]He really is smoking... Oh, he's smoking blood!
[46:40.43]They smoke blood in the future?
[46:41.65]That's another... Yeah, okay, they smoke fucking blood.
[46:54.27]Wash the dishes.
[47:00.19]I knew it.
[47:00.49]I knew he was doing a bunch of fucking drugs.
[47:09.90]Scan.
[47:12.24]Missing component.
[47:13.02]Dishwasher not working.
[47:17.14]Wait, it just automatically buys things for me?
[47:20.68]That's not okay.
[47:23.60]No, that's not okay.
[47:24.57]It didn't confirm with me first that I wanted to purchase that.
[47:27.51]Oh, I have to move the controller around.
[47:41.51]Are you guys okay with the world where the robot or Alexa orders stuff for you automatically without you telling it to?
[47:50.65]This guy's got a ton of credit card debt.
[47:52.67]You just ordered, like, a $400 part for his dishwasher.
[47:59.75]It's an $8,000 washing machine.
[48:04.43]Yeah, imagine paying $8,000 instead of washing your own dishes and, like, taking out your own trash and being tens of thousands of dollars in debt.
[48:17.09]Right away.
[48:20.09]And that's worth eight grand to me.
[48:21.57]I don't feel like getting up to get myself a beer.
[48:27.45]How much do I have to pay?
[48:32.37]Glassum.
[48:42.06]Is he smoking butane?
[48:43.44]Let's watch the hockey game.
[48:49.08]What are you looking at?
[48:51.69]Get the fuck out of here.
[48:54.21]Get the fuck out of here!
[48:56.89]I'll get back to work.
[48:58.39]This guy sucks.
[49:02.13]You want to let the android watch TV for five seconds, man?
[49:06.93]Alright, hold this vacuum.
[49:07.99]I'm going to vacuum in front of him.
[49:09.11]I can't wait to do this.
[49:12.77]I'm going to turn it on as loud as it can go and I'm going to put the vacuum in front of the TV.
[49:22.35]There's a vacuum.
[49:31.40]Is he gonna get mad again?
[49:43.83]I don't think he cares anymore.
[49:48.05]No, he doesn't.
[49:48.63]Alright, let's do the vacuum.
[49:53.17]Get the fuck out of here!
[50:01.11]Check the backyard.
[50:02.39]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[50:05.10]Get the fuck out of here!
[50:07.84]You blew my... He blew it.
[50:09.32]I was gonna... Whatever.
[50:10.44]Alright, check the backyard.
[50:13.12]What are the tasks in there?
[50:15.52]Check the backyard.
[50:22.05]Yeah, he can't push a button himself.
[50:24.03]What did that woman do?
[50:25.37]Finish first floor.
[50:26.23]No, wait, wait, wait.
[50:26.85]Check the back.
[50:27.29]I want to do everything.
[50:32.95]Yeah, he stepped all over my joke.
[50:34.61]Unbelievable.
[50:36.65]Take down the laundry.
[50:41.85]Jesus Christ.
[50:42.45]For a society that's this far ahead, you're hanging up your laundry like it's the 30s?
[50:47.68]Why?
[50:49.54]Why?
[50:52.16]There's been no advancement.
[50:53.88]Speaking of which, can I complain about something for a second here?
[50:56.54]Let me talk shit about this, because I don't understand this.
[51:00.09]So, washing machines are so behind the times.
[51:04.55]They really are.
[51:05.91]You're talking about we haven't figured out a way in almost a hundred years to not wash clothes and dry clothes more efficiently.
[51:15.49]A washing machine wets your clothes and then spins them.
[51:20.13]And then you put it into a dryer for an hour and 30 minutes for it to roll around with hot air in it.
[51:26.50]We haven't figured out like a dehydration machine where you can put the wet clothes in and it's a dehydrator.
[51:30.48]And it just... In like 10 minutes.
[51:33.78]Who's not figured that out?
[51:38.74]We've been using the same technology for washers and dryers since they were invented.
[51:52.59]There's a reason for the spinning.
[51:54.37]You should be able to wash and dry in the same machine.
[51:56.95]First person to do that, you're gonna get Disney World.
[52:01.15]Two different machines?
[52:01.91]Why does it have to be two different machines?
[52:04.57]How's school?
[52:05.17]You wanna play a game?
[52:05.81]Would you like to play a game?
[52:18.62]She's neutral.
[52:20.34]Apparently she doesn't... I just offered to play a game and she doesn't want to do it.
[52:25.77]That's already a thing.
[52:26.57]I'm just poor.
[52:29.71]What?
[52:30.69]You're telling me they have washing machines that wash and dry the clothes?
[52:36.18]Who?
[52:37.04]Who makes that?
[52:38.72]And under an hour.
[52:39.76]Under one hour for everything total.
[52:48.25]No, I don't believe you.
[52:49.01]How much is it?
[52:52.37]And I'm not talking like some space age bullshit.
[52:54.55]How much is that machine?
[52:58.41]They're $3,000.
[52:59.57]Okay, that's almost as much as half of one of these robots.
[53:03.99]50 years from now.
[53:05.52]So, come on.
[53:06.12]Give me a break.
[53:20.36]Buy it on Amazon.
[53:23.40]Oh, I eat Tide Pod on stream, right?
[53:25.60]What the hell is this?
[53:31.26]Red ice.
[53:31.74]Acetone, lithium, therium.
[53:33.78]Okay, so this is the shit he was smoking.
[53:35.04]So he really is smoking, like, butane.
[53:37.02]Okay, honestly, I thought that was an air freshener.
[53:49.28]You want to piss me off?
[53:50.54]An unopened one.
[53:51.28]You know, you're supposed to... Guys, do you guys know the trick with an air freshener?
[53:55.81]You don't just open it and just pull the whole thing out.
[53:58.05]You fuck the whole thing up.
[53:58.89]You can make an air freshener last like two years.
[54:01.45]You take the top off and you slowly slide the packaging down.
[54:06.53]to maybe a half an inch so the top of the tree is there.
[54:09.17]Leave it.
[54:10.55]Another month, pull it down a little more under the first leaf, under the first big branch.
[54:16.22]Keep coming down an inch or so, like a half an inch every two or three months.
[54:19.56]It'll last forever.
[54:26.84]Yes, and yes, I am aware.
[54:28.68]I'm totally aware that those things are like 48 cents.
[54:32.16]I understand.
[54:32.82]That's kind of a pain in the ass for something that's less than like a pack of gum.
[54:36.73]I get it, but we got to be frugal.
[54:38.73]I can't afford a fucking $3,000 washer dryer from the future.
[54:41.39]Are you kidding me?
[54:41.91]Alright, report to Todd.
[54:53.70]I've made a good start down here.
[54:55.20]I'll head upstairs.
[54:56.58]Do what you have to do, but stop bothering me.
[55:03.01]Thanks for the tip.
[55:03.73]What's the next task?
[55:06.11]Urgent task.
[55:06.65]Tidy Todd's room.
[55:07.75]Tidy Alice's room.
[55:08.85]Clean the bathroom.
[55:09.59]Alright, we're going right to the bathroom, because yuck.
[55:11.61]It's probably gross.
[55:14.45]I like this.
[55:15.33]I like... Okay, this is fun.
[55:18.99]It's kind of fun to just walk around and be an android.
[55:30.07]No, this is the... I like the... Okay, why is it that I like games where you just walk around and pick up stuff?
[55:36.09]House Flipper was one of my favorite games of the whole year.
[55:39.57]You know, like, am I really that much of a mundane fucking idiot that... Oh, yeah, I just really love picking clothes up off the ground.
[55:48.06]Yeah.
[55:49.22]It's exhilarating for me.
[55:51.70]Ah.
[55:54.04]What else do I like to do?
[55:56.22]Let me arrange these bottles.
[55:59.61]That's just bad highest to lowest both by height and volume what else is in here scrub the sink I Actually do this a lot you guys ever do this Next time you get a chance just do this Your face starts to look really weird after about five minutes.
[56:22.26]I'm not even kidding You started your face just has to blend into itself I
[56:29.54]And then you pick out random things.
[56:30.86]Holy shit, I didn't know my chin came down that far.
[56:34.48]You start to look like a monster after about five minutes.
[56:42.77]Okay, I'm... Alright, what's the next task?
[56:46.03]Mop the floor.
[56:50.69]Five minutes?
[56:51.50]You guys have never looked in the mirror just with a straight face for five minutes.
[56:57.38]Yeah, please.
[56:59.52]You want to talk about a journey?
[57:05.74]This thing is like a... I can't... It's like an iPhone.
[57:08.04]If you get your hand wet, you can't even use it.
[57:14.76]You guys, are you telling me you've never just stared into the mirror for five minutes?
[57:19.86]For, like, an existential purpose to, like, figure... Just figure... Let's figure it out.
[57:23.05]Let's take a look.
[57:25.03]Please.
[57:25.31]Please.
[57:34.41]I heard the bathroom, right?
[57:37.15]Tidy Todd's room, tidy Alice's room.
[57:40.70]This girl doesn't even have a bed.
[57:43.24]She has a Christmas tent.
[57:45.30]That doesn't seem right.
[57:46.89]At all.
[57:50.25]Oh, no, there's her bed.
[57:50.93]Okay, I was going to say, that's a little weird.
[58:01.44]Why don't you... You're talking about some of the greatest men.
[58:05.14]Some of the greatest men and women of our history have figured it out looking at themselves in the bathroom.
[58:10.66]I'll give you a prime example here.
[58:11.86]Bill Watterson, the guy that is responsible for Calvin and Hobbes.
[58:16.02]Great comic.
[58:16.80]Really, really, really great stuff that he made in that comic book.
[58:19.31]You know how he came up with a lot of the stuff for Calvin?
[58:21.73]A lot of the faces and stuff?
[58:23.93]Take a guess.
[58:25.25]Hmm.
[58:26.57]Do you think it's staring into the mirror?
[58:29.03]Because that's what it is.
[58:33.80]He got a lot of his Calvin and Hobbes ideas staring for five minutes straight, ten minutes straight in the mirror.
[58:39.04]Look it up.
[58:43.20]Look it up.
[58:47.35]Look it, that's real.
[58:48.49]Look that up.
[58:59.05]You look it up.
[59:00.03]You look it up.
[59:04.66]It's true.
[59:05.74]It's actually true.
[59:07.10]Yes, it is.
[59:12.56]She had a... What was that?
[59:13.70]Let me look at this again.
[59:15.82]Climbing up on a ladder.
[59:16.73]A couple of birds.
[59:19.23]There's a dog.
[59:19.85]A really big dog.
[59:21.91]The sun.
[59:23.59]Two suns.
[59:24.99]Butterfly.
[59:25.63]Is that supposed to be mom?
[59:28.69]Okay, I think I'm understanding here.
[59:32.05]Did mom fall off a ladder?
[59:38.93]Okay, that's good.
[59:39.53]We got... Let's do Todd's room.
[59:46.50]Anything else in the hallway?
[59:47.72]No.
[59:52.26]Traditional animators often had small mirrors on their desk to look in and do faces.
[59:58.00]Okay.
[60:00.84]Trying to tell me that Tex Avery isn't one of the most influential animators in the world?
[60:05.55]Okay.
[60:10.77]All sports.
[60:11.51]Android quarterback.
[60:14.19]Well, I guess that would make sense that they would take the sports jobs.
[60:20.16]The price of life.
[60:20.90]How driverless vehicles make life and death decisions.
[60:26.72]Is Mars your next holiday destination?
[60:32.69]We wouldn't need athletes anymore.
[60:33.85]It would just be who has the better code.
[60:42.82]Android athletes make no sense?
[60:44.94]Well, yeah, they do.
[60:45.84]Because it would be like, who can make the biggest, baddest quarterback?
[60:48.80]Who can make the biggest lineman?
[60:49.92]You know what I mean?
[60:51.45]It would be about tech companies making better people that could withstand more damage and give more offense.
[60:59.35]You'd start... You know, sports would be much more interesting if they were a bunch of robots.
[61:05.67]And they'd, like, run into each other and, like, explode and stuff like that.
[61:08.08]It'd be crazy.
[61:12.05]Can you imagine a quarterback throwing just a bomb Hail Mary into the end zone?
[61:24.53]At that point, you wouldn't have to worry about safety.
[61:28.49]So you could, instead of it being, you know, there's 12 men on the field.
[61:31.62]Oh, 12 on 12.
[61:33.12]No, you could do like 40 on 40, and they would just run into each other and hurt each other and stuff, and it wouldn't even matter.
[61:38.22]You could have so much more interesting shit happen with like 50 people on the field.
[61:44.93]Imagine a Hail Mary into the end zone with a hundred people standing there trying to block it and intercept it and stuff.
[61:49.03]Oh, it would be a nightmare.
[61:49.91]It would be amazing.
[61:50.47]Yeah, it would.
[61:51.43]Alright, what indie game is this?
[62:15.75]This is a pretty great hand-drawn indie side-scroller that we can play.
[62:25.98]Now we have to watch this.
[62:33.92]Alright.
[62:36.79]I don't want to swipe yet.
[62:37.65]I don't know what it is.
[62:47.30]Growing wings.
[62:56.74]So, this is just reverse Gremlins.
[63:03.33]We have to feed him again.
[63:04.27]Okay.
[63:07.85]Oh, no.
[63:08.17]Okay.
[63:08.63]It just started over.
[63:09.65]There was no... Oh.
[63:10.31]I didn't even change the channel.
[63:17.79]Wow, they-
[63:19.00]Honestly, I'm gonna tell you something right now. You try to pull off like a GTA television channel thing and you do it like this and you really want to make people sit here and watch.
[63:28.00]Uh you can't just have it be like 30 seconds or 45 seconds for each one - they got to be full TV shows. You can't even compare to the Grand Theft Auto 5 stuff I mean come on.
[63:38.00]It's just the same dumb hockey game that was playing downstairs.
[63:47.79]Oh, Jerma, you're wrong.
[63:48.91]What are you talking about?
[63:50.07]Even the news channels have like 500 LED screens behind them.
[63:53.41]Oh, Jerma, what are you talking about?
[63:54.93]The future doesn't have this dumb shit.
[63:57.11]No, there's just like 50 LED screens with different pictures on them behind her.
[64:00.58]They can't stop with the LED screens.
[64:03.40]What happened?
[64:08.66]Ventilate the room.
[64:16.51]Is that the Grinch?
[64:18.13]No.
[64:18.77]It is.
[64:20.83]That's the Grinch.
[64:22.77]So this guy... Alright, I get this guy.
[64:24.48]He's not a bad guy.
[64:25.38]That's a really good symbolism right there.
[64:31.46]Makes perfect sense.
[64:38.73]What does it say?
[64:42.79]Something bad.
[64:44.83]Why is my nervous meter going off?
[64:48.02]What's going on?
[64:48.86]Why am I accessing my hard drive?
[64:52.80]Am I going to crash?
[64:53.60]Usually that's what happens.
[64:54.26]When I look over and I see my hard drive being accessed, the game crashes.
[64:57.36]There's one last thing here.
[65:00.62]No, I already got it.
[65:01.46]No.
[65:05.89]Goodbye.
[65:10.67]Watch it.
[65:14.73]Okay.
[65:16.11]Clean the restroom.
[65:20.50]No.
[65:20.94]I just cleaned this restroom.
[65:28.97]That's disgusting.
[65:30.01]He just went to the bathroom.
[65:33.15]No robot.
[65:33.87]Nobody.
[65:34.29]Even if you're an android.
[65:35.29]That's not cool.
[65:38.79]Guys, I get embarrassed even if my dog comes over to when I just use the bathroom.
[65:42.61]If I leave the bathroom and he goes over there.
[65:43.95]I'm like, no, don't go over there, man.
[65:45.21]Just come over here.
[65:49.86]Could never have that happen.
[65:52.48]For me, if I use the bathroom, and, like, somebody's there, that person's not... I will find every reason to distract the person from going near that room for, like, an hour.
[66:05.59]Nothing else I can do besides talk to Alice.
[66:06.95]Okay.
[66:10.17]Oh, look, uh, the person that you have over, you, like, took a shit in that room, and, like, they're walking... Oh, yeah, let me get up and, like, go get a drink, and they're walking towards that bathroom.
[66:17.37]Hey, dude, hey, you wanna, um...
[66:19.67]You wanna, like, go out?
[66:20.35]You wanna, like, go, like, just to throw the ball around for a little bit?
[66:24.35]Just don't go over there.
[66:25.15]Come over, like, this way.
[66:28.17]Diplomatic.
[66:29.55]I know I used to live here, but they erased my memory.
[66:32.93]I thought maybe you could help me get my bearings.
[66:35.38]Give me some advice.
[66:36.78]That kind of thing.
[66:38.24]Wait, so I'm mom?
[66:41.34]Name, Kara.
[66:42.70]My name, Kara.
[66:45.04]You're very quiet.
[66:46.66]This is the mom.
[66:47.06]I hope I don't scare you.
[66:51.43]Um... Um... How's mom doing?
[66:52.48]No.
[66:52.60]Ah!
[66:52.70]I knew it!
[66:53.00]I even knew it!
[66:55.26]Why did I do that?
[66:56.46]Fuck!
[66:57.66]What'd you just give me?
[67:21.55]God damn it.
[67:22.75]I told you I even looked at the fucking ladder.
[67:33.41]I don't know.
[67:34.56]God damn it.
[67:35.22]What have I done?
[67:36.98]Don't worry.
[67:43.96]What am I... What the fuck?
[67:50.16]I forgot, like, choices actually matter in this game.
[67:57.19]It's not the same predetermined two endings on the same engine for 17 years.
[68:02.79]Okay, so that's definitely... Okay, mom is obviously not around anymore.
[68:16.99]Who's this?
[68:25.95]Okay.
[68:30.81]That's me.
[68:33.67]Oh, okay, so now I get it.
[68:37.64]Okay, I understand.
[68:38.52]I just had a fragmented hard drive for a second.
[68:45.75]I'm about to defrag.
[68:49.17]Oh, he destroyed me.
[68:50.19]And it made her sad.
[68:51.79]And mom is gone.
[68:52.81]I get it.
[68:59.36]We're gonna have to talk him down here in a second here.
[69:02.12]I'm certain of it.
[69:11.69]Todd?
[69:13.53]Todd, I'm done cleaning the shit you just left.
[69:15.27]Uh-oh.
[69:20.15]What are you doing?
[69:22.45]I'm playing.
[69:23.13]You're playing?
[69:27.18]I know what you're thinking.
[69:30.15]You think your dad's a lowlife?
[69:32.43]Huh?
[69:33.61]Fucking loser?
[69:35.27]Can't get a job?
[69:36.31]Take care of his family?
[69:38.03]Why would a little kid think that?
[69:38.99]Don't you think I tried to make things work?
[69:42.91]But whatever I do, when someone comes along, they just fuck it all up!
[69:48.47]I know what you think of me.
[69:50.53]You hate me.
[69:52.09]You hate me, don't you?
[69:54.71]Alright, Tom, where's the intervene button?
[69:56.25]You hate me!
[70:02.44]Is there any more trash?
[70:08.79]Get over there!
[70:09.59]Well, that was interesting.
[70:10.33]Okay.
[70:10.45]Whoa.
[70:36.29]That was a lot.
[70:37.93]That was a lot of things.
[70:41.03]Coward discovers a way down.
[70:42.69]Do I have to escape?
[70:47.04]Let's see the stats here.
[70:50.28]Rewash the clothes.
[70:51.30]A lot of people didn't do that.
[70:55.00]A lot of people didn't do any of this stuff.
[70:58.95]99%.
[70:59.15]100% pretty much.
[71:00.93]Everybody did upstairs.
[71:02.75]Pop with Alice.
[71:03.61]Gave you the key.
[71:04.35]You open the box.
[71:07.38]So are these people down here, right?
[71:09.56]The first floor?
[71:10.80]The washing the clothes and finding the ice and getting Todd angry?
[71:15.26]Is that just because you just walked right over to Todd and said, hey, what's next?
[71:17.83]Probably.
[71:18.19]That's cool, though.
[71:21.01]Let's keep going.
[71:23.31]Because cleaning is boring.
[71:27.96]Is this game about robots?
[71:31.14]I kind of.
[71:32.92]It's about the relationship between human and android and how weird, it's not what you would expect.
[71:39.93]You know, sure, they clean your house and you make them do these things, but what are they?
[71:46.13]Are they people too?
[71:47.55]That's the real meat and potatoes of this journey we're on.
[72:08.93]Okay, just need to do that for like a few minutes.
[72:12.33]Put down the pants.
[72:15.59]Stop it.
[72:16.53]No, I refuse.
[72:18.11]Deposit package.
[72:20.23]Take care of Carl.
[72:21.35]Wake Carl upstairs.
[72:23.91]Hold on, just a minute.
[72:26.91]Okay.
[72:27.57]Nothing else here?
[72:28.95]There's a bird cage here.
[72:29.79]Where's the bird?
[72:32.02]Is the bird an android too?
[72:35.02]Or are these just toys?
[72:36.78]I think these are toys.
[72:40.36]Yeah, these are androids.
[72:41.44]Of course they made a bird first.
[72:44.80]Yep.
[72:45.64]They already have this.
[72:47.74]So we're getting pretty close, guys.
[72:52.80]You want me to show you?
[72:55.23]If that's the first step, it obviously is.
[73:05.47]We already have this shit.
[73:12.96]You should all be terrified.
[73:15.95]Because of this.
[73:17.15]Because we've made lots of strides.
[73:23.41]We might not be too far off.
[73:25.13]Remember this technology?
[73:38.74]We are fucking close.
[73:47.46]You should be scared.
[74:03.12]How many of you guys have one of those things?
[74:09.04]I turned the birds on.
[74:10.00]They're going to eventually do something for me.
[74:12.42]Look at the painting.
[74:15.46]That's a person's face.
[74:16.34]No, that's the Joker.
[74:20.41]Big fan of, uh... Big fan of that Gotham City.
[74:25.19]Whatever that is.
[74:25.79]Could be a robot.
[74:26.45]Who knows?
[74:28.57]Interesting house.
[74:29.13]It's a museum house.
[74:36.16]See, I wouldn't want this TV.
[74:37.44]You see how much this TV sucks?
[74:40.04]The color depth.
[74:40.84]It's a hologram TV.
[74:42.46]It just looks like it's on a projector.
[74:43.84]That's not quality.
[74:44.80]That's not a 4K LED display.
[74:48.76]Surprising, considering they're everywhere.
[74:52.84]Life found on Titan.
[74:54.16]Evidence for alien life grows.
[74:55.40]Okay.
[74:56.26]Cool.
[74:57.92]President Warren to make state visit to United Kingdom.
[75:04.01]Titan's a planet, I'm assuming.
[75:09.13]Big bits again.
[75:10.03]Oh, God.
[75:10.87]Polo juice again with another $100.
[75:14.71]$200 tonight.
[75:15.03]$200.
[75:15.65]Do you hear how many?
[75:18.11]I said $100.
[75:20.35]Can I have a refund on my last $100 for that flipping dog joke?
[75:33.73]Don't you know there are no refunds?
[75:37.73]No refunds.
[75:41.59]It's point of sale only.
[75:42.87]Let's go over and look at this.
[75:51.22]Yeah, once the point of sale happens, I don't even know where it is.
[75:53.48]I can play the piano?
[75:55.82]Alright, let me try to play the piano.
[76:03.77]Jeremy confirmed greedy.
[76:05.07]I physically could not refund that.
[76:09.93]You know, you understand how bits work, right?
[76:11.93]Bits go into Twitch's server, like, Twitch handles those.
[76:15.57]I don't touch them.
[76:19.11]Like, that's a Twitch backend thing.
[76:22.35]You think I have a button here that's like, oh, here, let's refund that money there.
[76:29.57]Because I already spent it.
[76:30.57]Yeah, because he did the blockchain brain.
[76:35.79]I already deposited it into my hard drive bank.
[76:38.91]Alright, let's go.
[76:39.51]I'm done playing pianos.
[76:40.39]Let's go upstairs.
[76:46.92]But there's other interesting things.
[76:48.40]I need to touch everything.
[76:52.43]Refund button.
[76:53.49]No.
[76:55.09]Don't you guys know that's the reason why I don't use PayPal?
[76:57.77]It's because I...
[76:59.46]I don't want to have a scenario where somebody like imagine imagine like somebody donated you like 500 bucks and it's like what the whoa oh I'm gonna I'm gonna buy a bunch of with that 500 and then like paypal tells you 30 days later uh that money you need to give that back like huh what what happened
[77:29.44]Say no refunds.
[77:36.51]I already have my Ethereum address there.
[77:41.63]You want a fast, essentially fee-less way to send money?
[77:45.92]Look no further than the blockchain.
[77:49.22]I swear to God, I'm not trying to do this right now.
[77:52.43]It's just the opportunity presented itself.
[77:54.61]By the way, only two or three people have ever used that.
[77:58.01]And I was supposed to delete it.
[78:00.17]I have this picture.
[78:03.53]I have this upstairs.
[78:09.95]Where is this guy sleeping?
[78:11.61]Why does he have dinosaur bones in his house?
[78:13.34]I hear he's in here.
[78:25.25]Wait, anything in here?
[78:26.33]The guy's got, like, lip-mouth pillows.
[78:28.35]Nice emote pillows, dude.
[78:34.29]Let's get in here.
[78:39.76]Good morning, Carl.
[78:41.24]Good morning.
[78:42.34]It's 10 a.m.
[78:43.88]The weather is partly cloudy, 54 degrees, 80% humidity with a strong possibility of afternoon showers.
[78:51.20]It sounds like a good day to spend in bed.
[78:53.14]That's true.
[78:55.58]I did go to pick up the paint that you ordered.
[78:58.28]Oh, yes, I've forgotten.
[79:00.52]That is the difference between you and me, right, monsters?
[79:05.19]You never forget anything.
[79:06.39]Yeah, just, like, open his jaw and, like, stuff pills in his mouth, close and, like, crunch his jaw for him and then leave.
[79:12.19]That's what an android would do.
[79:15.20]They don't have the human touch.
[79:16.38]They don't have empathy or emotions.
[79:19.22]Feed him pills.
[79:20.22]It would be open up can, stuff in his mouth, shove in his mouth, close.
[79:25.40]They don't understand softness.
[79:28.15]Show me your arm, please, Carl.
[79:30.43]No.
[79:31.81]Carl.
[79:34.53]Thank you.
[79:37.89]I just opened my eyes and I'm already gritting my teeth.
[79:46.55]You ready, Carl?
[79:47.13]But what do they say at the doctor?
[79:50.46]Quick pinch?
[79:51.66]Humans are such a fragile machine.
[79:55.60]They break down so quickly.
[79:57.82]All this effort to keep them going.
[80:03.89]Hey, what happened to your clothes?
[80:07.55]Oh, it's nothing.
[80:08.17]Why are they still on?
[80:08.83]Just some demonstrators in the street, Carl.
[80:11.72]What a bunch of idiots.
[80:14.40]They think they can stop progress by roughing up a few androids?
[80:20.61]I hope they didn't harm you.
[80:22.23]Oh, no, no.
[80:23.55]They just pushed me around, Carl.
[80:25.75]I'm fine.
[80:27.29]Okay.
[80:29.83]I'll take you to the bathroom now.
[80:31.57]Oh, yeah.
[80:33.05]We get to do a slow bathroom walk with dialog.
[80:35.63]I can't wait.
[80:37.85]Come on.
[80:38.98]Here we go.
[80:41.39]Okay.
[80:44.93]We're doing the wedding thing.
[80:50.39]Sorry, I had to do a quick update there.
[80:54.64]Yeah, we're gonna bring you in.
[80:56.92]Just married.
[80:57.80]That's a weird guy, huh?
[81:14.68]I don't think I even wiped his ass.
[81:20.94]It's too loud?
[81:21.74]Alright, let's go around.
[81:27.92]Tell me about your life while we go around.
[81:31.11]Take Carl to the dining table.
[81:32.49]Are you sure the correct answer is not run from the other side of the room and dump him through a window?
[81:45.05]Alright, we go to dining room.
[81:47.91]See how imperfect robots are?
[81:52.68]A person would not have needed to do this.
[81:59.16]I'm doing the equivalent of a Roomba right now.
[82:01.32]Alright, let's go.
[82:02.24]Dining room.
[82:05.69]Where's this dining room table?
[82:07.49]Down there?
[82:10.40]Do I have to run him down the stairs?
[82:14.66]Can I just push him down the stairs?
[82:16.98]Alright, Carl.
[82:17.70]Let's go.
[82:18.58]Aww, we can't do the fun way.
[82:30.72]That's fast.
[82:31.34]That's too fast.
[82:33.85]Those things are always so slow in the commercials.
[82:35.43]It takes like a full two minutes to go three flights of stairs.
[82:39.52]Not even.
[82:42.46]Four or five steps is a good 12 seconds.
[83:09.76]I just made somebody really mad.
[83:11.92]Somebody's really mad here.
[83:13.34]I know it for a fact.
[83:16.04]Yeah, we're gonna carve off some of this antelope, whatever the fuck this thing is.
[83:19.32]It's a giraffe.
[83:30.03]several people more than several people are angry alright Carl come on over here I got your favorite children's diner play set thing that you have crayons and drawn that piece of paper that they give to every table with the four broken crayons I know you like it chicken fingers again macaroni and cheese
[84:02.69]Serve breakfast.
[84:05.91]Alright, let's take this.
[84:06.87]What does he get?
[84:14.11]Anything in that?
[84:16.89]What's in there?
[84:17.91]I want to see what it is.
[84:18.49]I want to look at it.
[84:19.05]It's like rotten tomatoes in there.
[84:25.65]Don't tell me this guy eats pomegranate seeds.
[84:28.23]I will uninstall the game if this is a pomegranate.
[84:31.47]If this dude is eating a pomegranate and it's proven to me, I'm going to uninstall the game and stop the stream.
[84:35.39]Stream's over.
[84:44.59]Okay.
[84:45.41]Second rule.
[84:47.17]If there's a crab or a lobster under here, I'm also uninstalling the game and deleting.
[84:51.90]And I won't stream for a year.
[84:55.46]Thank you, Marcus.
[84:57.24]Okay, that was my pleasure.
[84:57.90]Tensions continue to rise in the
[85:03.50]What is it?
[85:03.80]Does it have a smiley face on it?
[85:12.21]Is this a napkin?
[85:18.97]I'm putting it on his lap.
[85:22.15]No one eats crap from... Are you serious?
[85:24.20]Sure.
[85:24.38]Okay, Carl.
[85:30.71]You know, like, look at the guy's house.
[85:33.15]You're trying to tell me that it wouldn't be against the realm of possibility?
[85:36.57]That Carl, the guy that has a giraffe in his living room, wouldn't potentially eat crab for breakfast?
[85:42.60]That's very possible.
[85:43.46]Alright, I find something to do.
[85:47.10]So I'm just a bored android now, okay.
[85:54.11]US tensions escalate in the Arctic.
[85:58.29]Television off.
[86:00.15]Do I have to do that?
[86:01.56]Should I play with some Plato, Shakespeare, or Keats' Odes?
[86:04.20]Let's learn about the stars in the galaxy.
[86:08.36]Come on, install it.
[86:23.68]You don't have to read books in 2038.
[86:24.72]What are you reading?
[86:27.72]Plato's Republic.
[86:29.24]It's one of the books you recommended.
[86:31.26]So, what do you think?
[86:32.64]I quite like philosophy, I think.
[86:35.14]It asks the questions that I can't answer.
[86:37.61]What is right or what is wrong, for example.
[86:40.35]It's not something that is so easy to decide.
[86:42.67]Asking questions that have no answer is part of being human, Marcus.
[86:48.71]One day I won't be here to take care of you anymore.
[86:51.63]That's the other way around.
[86:53.49]I'm carrying you to the bathroom, dude.
[86:56.57]I'm sure it's not me taking care of you.
[87:01.09]This world doesn't like those who are different, Marcus.
[87:04.52]Don't let anyone tell you who you should be.
[87:06.64]Let's go to the studio.
[87:12.96]Okay, Carl.
[87:21.29]So this is telling the story of a couple of different robots who are trying to just turn into a couple of humans.
[87:26.76]Interesting.
[87:30.88]This is a really beautiful painting.
[87:33.62]That's surprising.
[87:36.02]Revealing multiple murals across multiple walls.
[87:40.63]Beautiful stuff, man.
[87:44.73]Yeah, that's really cool, actually.
[87:54.52]Is the guy gonna get in the, uh, the Wrigley machine?
[87:58.28]The alien machine?
[87:59.82]Pull it down.
[88:17.28]It would be amazing to have that until there's a hailstorm.
[88:22.16]Alright, I gotta clean up his studio while he paints.
[88:28.34]This is really cool paint that is used.
[88:30.20]It's like 3D paint.
[88:34.74]It might be digital art, too, because it's moving around.
[88:37.90]Yeah, okay, I see.
[88:38.78]There's a big, huge 500-inch LEDs here.
[88:45.26]And they're everywhere, of course.
[88:46.30]Why wouldn't they be?
[88:49.08]Pretty good art, though.
[88:50.40]Even if it is digital.
[88:57.69]Can't clean that up.
[89:06.08]Oh, come on, please.
[89:11.61]But I can't have a little bit of fun in a couple of humans in Detroit, please.
[89:18.87]So, what's your verdict, Marcus?
[89:24.77]I don't like this.
[89:26.13]I actually don't like it.
[89:27.43]I'm not a very good judge.
[89:31.06]I don't think it's your best work.
[89:34.20]The truth is I have nothing left to say anymore.
[89:37.86]Each day that goes by brings me closer to the end.
[89:41.24]I'm just an old man clinging to his brushes.
[89:45.31]Carl.
[89:48.59]But enough about me.
[89:51.35]Let's see if you have any talent.
[89:53.13]Did I get to paint something?
[89:54.77]Give it a try.
[89:56.05]Try painting something.
[89:57.56]Oh, I can't wait.
[90:05.47]Yes.
[90:07.07]An open canvas.
[90:11.65]Here we go.
[90:14.79]See, if I wanted to be a cheeky asshole, I would just take that and just press it against the board and hold it there for five minutes.
[90:23.29]Hopefully there's a mirror up here near my face I can look at to have the time pass.
[90:29.67]And I would just let it go and it would be the imprint.
[90:31.95]Find a subject to paint.
[90:37.81]Oh, okay.
[90:40.53]Paint the desk, paint the statue.
[90:42.03]Is there anything else?
[90:42.75]Can I paint him?
[90:45.07]Can I paint his painting?
[90:46.51]Yeah, I'm going to paint his painting.
[90:48.37]I'm going to do it better.
[90:56.03]I really didn't like this.
[90:57.13]Let me improve on it.
[91:07.47]That is a perfect copy of reality.
[91:12.33]I'm going to have to DMCA claim that painting.
[91:16.74]It's about interpreting and proving on it, showing something you see.
[91:23.64]Carl, I don't think I can do that.
[91:26.26]It's not in my program.
[91:28.16]Go on.
[91:29.32]Go.
[91:29.44]Try it.
[91:29.90]Grab that canvas.
[91:31.26]Oh, come on.
[91:31.88]I have to do it.
[91:36.00]So he didn't like it either.
[91:36.98]So there you go.
[91:37.62]So it's a shit painting.
[91:40.13]I didn't like it.
[91:41.11]You didn't like it.
[91:42.15]Do something for me.
[91:43.05]Close your eyes.
[91:44.51]Close your eyes.
[91:46.65]Trust me.
[91:47.03]Alright, there's your thumbnail.
[91:56.28]Right there.
[92:00.99]Try to imagine something that doesn't exist, something you've never seen.
[92:05.85]Now concentrate on how it makes you feel and let your hand drift across the canvas.
[92:13.46]Hold X to close your eyes.
[92:17.40]There we go.
[92:19.30]He's uploading it.
[92:21.00]Android's humanity identity.
[92:24.24]Well, I'm going to have to say identity.
[92:27.97]Despair, doubts, prisoner, identity, doubt.
[92:36.94]You know, who am I?
[92:42.68]What am I?
[92:44.10]Am I an android?
[92:44.90]Am I a person?
[92:45.52]Do I, do I do?
[92:46.78]What do I do?
[92:48.44]How do I live?
[92:49.14]How do I continue to live?
[92:50.29]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if it's the same painting.
[92:55.11]All this epic music and it's just the same blue painting that I just did.
[93:02.22]Just have it feel.
[93:03.24]And he turns and he's like, I told you I can't do this.
[93:06.12]Like, I literally can only copy because I have a fucking computer program.
[93:13.13]Come on, what do you got?
[93:20.56]It's just what I see in the mirror.
[93:22.63]It's just my mirror.
[93:24.07]That's what I see.
[93:26.05]I look in the mirror too much every day, if you can already tell.
[93:29.13]Hey, Dad.
[93:31.61]Leo.
[93:35.44]I didn't hear you come in.
[93:36.66]No, I was in the neighborhood.
[93:37.96]I thought I'd stop by.
[93:40.04]It's been a while, right?
[93:41.04]Is this guy violent?
[93:46.48]You don't look so good.
[93:47.08]Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
[93:48.32]That's so funny.
[93:49.60]Hey, listen, uh, I need some cash, Dad.
[93:53.56]Again?
[93:55.18]Jesse.
[93:55.74]What happened to the money I just gave you?
[93:58.63]Uh, well, it just goes, you know?
[94:01.29]Yeah.
[94:03.39]Yeah, you're on it again, aren't you?
[94:05.21]No.
[94:06.15]No, no, I swear, it's not that.
[94:07.71]No, don't lie to me, Leo.
[94:09.09]What difference does it make?
[94:09.79]I just need some cash, that's all.
[94:12.61]Sorry.
[94:14.41]The answer is no.
[94:16.26]What?
[94:16.86]Why?
[94:17.46]You know why.
[94:18.20]Yeah, yeah, I think I do know why.
[94:24.78]You'd rather take care of your plastic toy here than your own son, right?
[94:29.34]Tell me, Dad, what's it got that I don't?
[94:31.93]Smarter?
[94:33.17]More obedient?
[94:34.47]Not like me, right?
[94:35.81]It looks like the Tyler1 photo.
[94:36.89]You know what this thing is not your son.
[94:39.45]It's a fucking machine!
[94:40.59]Hey!
[94:41.13]Get out of here!
[94:44.38]It does?
[94:48.08]I don't even know what you're talking about.
[95:13.62]Self-defense activated.
[95:23.14]I like the sounds it makes here.
[95:24.26]Alright, here we go.
[95:24.80]Let's take a look.
[95:26.88]1700 points.
[95:29.51]Let's not show the legend.
[95:30.63]Show the world stats.
[95:31.25]Let's go all the way back here.
[95:34.36]Only 31% of everybody has read the book.
[95:37.86]We pride ourselves on intelligence here and on making sure that we're all very educated.
[95:42.70]The Republic by Plato.
[95:45.30]Plato.
[95:45.84]11%, you know, it's so easy to click on Shakespeare.
[95:52.93]Take him to the studio, copy Carl's painting.
[95:55.49]It's pretty much across the board, pretty even.
[95:58.63]Painting Identity and Doubt.
[96:01.97]So most people did that.
[96:04.21]And most people did.
[96:05.45]I did pretty much what everybody else did.
[96:10.42]So that's cool.
[96:13.42]Interesting stuff.
[96:14.22]Let's keep going.
[96:21.34]Jeremy Plato.
[96:24.44]Jimmy's back.
[96:30.10]So this looks like another case.
[96:32.18]So we control three playable characters.
[96:34.16]So far.
[96:34.54]No androids allowed.
[96:36.12]This is the guy that you have to think quick, and you have to... Don't worry, I got... No androids allowed, except here comes an android.
[96:48.59]Find Lieutenant Anderson.
[96:53.39]Scanning.
[96:54.71]Uh, scan faces.
[97:06.06]Jimmy Peterson.
[97:07.52]Caught him in a bad second there.
[97:09.76]Pretty much, he's doing the thumbnail.
[97:12.70]Business owner, no criminal record.
[97:14.32]Okay.
[97:14.98]Anybody else?
[97:15.82]Scan this person.
[97:20.76]Edward Dempsey.
[97:21.98]Administrator, no criminal record.
[97:26.87]Who else we got here?
[97:27.79]We got this guy.
[97:29.51]We don't see that face though.
[97:30.57]We gotta get some more faces.
[97:36.08]Yeah, go ahead.
[97:38.17]Give me a nice image of your face, buddy.
[97:41.93]Derek Myers, security guard.
[97:43.43]No criminal record.
[97:47.45]There's a guy sitting over here.
[97:50.06]Criminal record's gonna... This is gonna be... That's gonna be the Jesse guy right here.
[97:55.76]Need this dude's face.
[97:59.58]There he is.
[98:00.00]Jesse.
[98:00.20]Jesse.
[98:04.65]Christopher Gray.
[98:05.67]Unemployed.
[98:06.37]Record.
[98:06.76]He has DUI.
[98:09.46]Okay.
[98:10.50]Keep that in mind.
[98:11.22]Who are you sitting with?
[98:17.20]Not a very good image in his face, but... Jonah Graham.
[98:19.66]No criminal record.
[98:20.33]Unemployed.
[98:21.21]I'm not gonna buy you a drink.
[98:24.21]I need to see this guy's face.
[98:25.87]Wait, hold on.
[98:26.57]New guy.
[98:32.23]Kim Johan.
[98:34.06]Domestic abuse, and he's a delivery driver.
[98:36.80]Or he's currently unemployed.
[98:39.31]Hello.
[98:39.77]Okay, now I understand why no androids are allowed in here.
[98:42.07]Because I'm just scanning every single person in the bar and looking up all their personal information.
[98:48.21]No wonder they're not allowed.
[98:50.84]Who are you?
[98:51.82]There he is.
[98:52.14]Lieutenant Hank Anderson.
[98:53.98]Police lieutenant, no criminal record.
[98:56.56]There he is.
[98:59.12]I want to scan this.
[99:00.30]You know we've got to scan everybody.
[99:04.19]Wait, we gotta wait till we get... Hold on.
[99:06.99]Got it.
[99:07.27]Big mistake looking over here.
[99:10.31]Oh, what?
[99:11.07]What was his name?
[99:14.05]Shit.
[99:15.23]Well, hopefully he wasn't a criminal.
[99:18.04]Where am I going?
[99:18.48]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[99:19.40]Don't go in the bathroom.
[99:20.10]Go find Lieutenant... What's his name?

[99:34.68]accountant and he's a narcotic supplier okay interesting what about you Chris roberts no criminal record okay I looked for you at the station but nobody knew where you were
[100:03.28]They said you were probably having a drink nearby.
[100:06.38]I was lucky to find you at the fifth bar.
[100:08.74]I like this guy.
[100:09.30]I like this actor.
[100:11.30]He's very robotic.
[100:11.70]You were assigned a case early this evening.
[100:13.98]A homicide involving a cyberlife android.
[100:17.80]In accordance with procedure, the company has allocated a specialized model to assist investigators.
[100:22.74]Well, I don't need any assistance.
[100:25.20]Especially not from a plastic asshole like you.
[100:28.12]Just be a good little robot and get the fuck out of here.
[100:37.21]I think you should stop drinking and come with me.
[100:39.80]Why did you shut he's gonna turn and slap me Do it Come on, I'm sorry lieutenant, but I must insist my instructions stipulate that I have to accompany you You know where you can stick your instructions No
[101:00.22]You're out of your ass, dickhead.
[101:09.43]No, you fucking fucked up.
[101:12.03]I think we can go now.
[101:14.24]It's Mr. Krabs.
[101:14.66]It's Mr. Krabs!
[101:15.38]Oh, that's amazing.
[101:15.90]I'm so glad we have Mr. Krabs here.
[101:51.33]When he starts yelling, that's when it really comes out.
[102:01.88]I thought I just ran into all those people.
[102:12.05]No, you gotta be firm with this guy.
[102:14.01]I don't care if he hates me.
[102:24.90]This is the type of guy that you gotta be firm with, but apparently not.
[102:30.64]He told me to stay.
[102:32.54]Any mirrors in this part?
[102:36.40]That's it.
[102:36.94]I'm off.
[102:37.56]Let's take a look around.
[102:45.67]Follow Lieutenant Anderson.
[102:47.03]Should I, like... Should I, like, open the... Should I smell inside the ambulance?
[102:58.45]Excuse me.
[103:01.36]Excuse me, android police.
[103:04.08]Androids are not permitted beyond this point.
[103:06.04]Yes, they are.
[103:06.82]It's with me.
[103:15.15]You don't talk, you don't touch anything, and you stay out of my way.
[103:18.28]Got it?
[103:18.44]Got it.
[103:20.02]Got it!
[103:20.24]I'm getting like a sideshow Bob consistency from this guy.
[103:22.52]I don't know why that happened.
[103:24.68]Should I scan some faces?
[103:27.12]No.
[103:27.32]I want the cool- I want this camera.
[103:50.29]Wait, I gotta do the NPC.
[103:56.98]Right.
[104:08.05]Who am I?
[104:13.09]Back in the sky.
[104:13.49]Gonna wait until morning.
[104:17.40]I'd stay in there for a good three weeks.
[104:20.06]Get in the house.
[104:21.32]There's a kitchen knife over here.
[104:24.80]Probably the murder weapon.
[104:26.06]I'm going in.
[104:26.64]I'm in.
[104:29.00]I am alive.
[104:30.40]The landlord said the front door was locked from the inside.
[104:33.10]All the windows were boarded up.
[104:34.92]The killer must have gone out the back way.
[104:36.79]What do we know about his android?
[104:38.73]Not much.
[104:40.05]The neighbors confirmed he had one, but it wasn't here when we arrived.
[104:44.88]I gotta get some air.
[104:46.70]Okay.
[104:47.00]Make yourself at home.
[104:47.82]Review the evidence.
[104:48.98]I'll be outside if you need me.
[104:50.64]That's so funny how half of this game is you taking care of old people, and the other half is investigating crime scenes.
[104:57.49]He's smoking the filings from the air freshener.
[105:04.19]You use drugs?
[105:07.79]Got more stuff lying around here.
[105:09.03]Shoot on the ground.
[105:11.75]Analyze the blood, please.
[105:14.74]This letter is perfect.
[105:18.23]Taste it?
[105:19.19]Mm-hmm.
[105:20.99]Oh, Jesus, what the hell are you doing?
[105:23.49]I'm metalizing the blood.
[105:25.41]I can check samples in real time.
[105:27.85]I'm sorry.
[105:28.89]That's really cool.
[105:32.51]Okay, just don't put any more evidence in your mouth, you got it?
[105:37.20]Got it.
[105:40.38]Fucking hell, I can't believe this shit.
[105:45.83]Uh, DNA analyst.
[105:47.05]Carlos Ortiz.
[105:49.45]Alright, running through the system.
[105:54.37]Closet over here.
[105:58.55]Yeah, why don't you scan by here?
[106:02.75]Cigarettes?
[106:06.18]Nothing.
[106:08.30]There's a guy at the window!
[106:09.48]Guy at the window!
[106:10.50]Well, that's a good guy.
[106:13.04]Alright, there's a guy holding like a weird blue vial out there.
[106:15.22]I thought he was like a murderer.
[106:20.14]Connor is the nerdy C-3PO android you were talking about.
[106:23.58]Right?
[106:26.65]Even if they gave him a metallic mouth.
[106:30.41]Like from his lips down, it was metal.
[106:31.95]That's not a person.
[106:32.79]Let me examine the victim.
[106:44.07]Let's examine this.
[106:46.81]Is it the same blood?
[106:52.04]Taste this too, but just don't let him see you.
[106:54.94]Regular letters, font, CyberLife Sans.
[106:59.02]Here.
[107:00.28]What about you?
[107:04.30]This guy's seen better days.
[107:08.98]Yeah, he was snorting that red stuff.
[107:12.56]Maggot's infected his body.
[107:16.42]28 knife wounds.
[107:17.78]Okay, internal bleeding 28 stab wounds.
[107:19.56]Deceased more than 19 days ago.
[107:25.15]What else we got here?
[107:26.77]I already got that.
[107:27.75]Hand.
[107:29.53]Maggot's in his hand.
[107:32.22]Carlos Ortiz, that's the match.
[107:37.20]What else we got here?
[107:40.81]Blood on the wall.
[107:42.51]Where's I?
[107:45.60]He's dead.
[107:46.74]Yes.
[107:47.08]Now let's reconstruct and see what happened to him.
[107:52.52]Stand up.
[108:00.57]It looks like he's eating a sandwich.
[108:03.33]Alright, so he's eating a very large sandwich.
[108:08.39]No, he dropped it.
[108:09.07]He dropped the sandwich.
[108:10.11]And it's pissed him off.
[108:12.11]He stands up.
[108:16.26]Somebody's in front of him.
[108:17.02]He's in an argument with... No, he... What happened here?
[108:21.04]Okay.
[108:26.26]Victim fell here.
[108:32.36]So he tripped.
[108:34.47]Ah, shit!
[108:37.70]What's next?
[108:38.22]We've got the blood there.
[108:41.02]No, he's... Okay, he was stabbed.
[108:45.68]Right there.
[108:47.28]Boom!
[108:48.10]Into the table.
[108:52.41]Guy's chasing him with the knife.
[108:53.41]Victim fell.
[108:54.13]Stabbed again.
[108:54.77]Stabbed again.
[108:55.37]Back into the sandwich position.
[108:58.41]And he ate it.
[108:59.09]He ate the knife.
[109:00.35]Holy shit.
[109:01.05]Okay.
[109:01.37]Well, let's go back.
[109:06.11]Did he fight back?
[109:09.50]Somebody else there?
[109:13.11]They came from the kitchen.
[109:16.28]Well, he must have known the attacker.
[109:25.68]He was stabbed 28 times.
[109:29.08]Yeah.
[109:30.61]Seems like the killer really had it in for him.
[109:35.57]Psycho, yeah.
[109:36.91]That is a psycho.
[109:38.67]There's still seven more pieces of evidence I have to look at.
[109:40.89]There's a knife on the ground now that I know the knife is there.
[109:43.51]Let's examine the knife.
[109:51.33]No fingerprints.
[109:51.95]Android involvement.
[109:55.75]So a droid stabbed is due to death.
[109:57.25]Alright, put him on the stand.
[109:59.72]I get it.
[110:00.98]I know exactly what happened here.
[110:04.68]More stuff.
[110:07.18]Dried blood.
[110:09.00]He fell backwards here.
[110:12.14]The dry blood stain here.
[110:14.83]HGB.
[110:17.27]That means he was taking human growth.
[110:20.51]Hormones.
[110:27.51]There he is again.
[110:28.21]He was sitting in the chair.
[110:29.23]Signs of struggle.
[110:33.75]What else is in this room?
[110:34.71]We got a sink.
[110:35.93]Another magazine to read.
[110:37.47]He was really into dancing girls.
[110:40.51]Android sex officially better.
[110:42.83]Sorry ladies, but plastic can't be beat.
[110:46.29]Let's get some more details on this.
[110:49.19]Is your android spying on you?
[110:50.75]CyberLife could be using its android to collect private information.
[110:56.64]Interesting.
[110:59.66]It's official, yeah.
[111:00.58]Officially confirmed.
[111:04.52]Anything in the window?
[111:06.43]What's that?
[111:08.35]Is that a firework?
[111:09.29]Nothing really.
[111:12.71]This is where the knives were taken from.
[111:19.82]Alright.
[111:21.20]A couple more pieces of evidence as a baseball bat tried to fight.
[111:23.82]Come on, guys.
[111:26.05]Get a move on.
[111:26.91]We're going to want to be here all night.
[111:28.47]Don't worry.
[111:28.95]No one wants to stay.
[111:32.63]Grab the fingerprints.
[111:37.85]VRV throwing away Alexa.
[111:41.38]Hey, you wait.
[111:43.66]Hold on.
[111:44.52]Violent impact.
[111:45.46]Let's see who got hit.
[111:49.09]Did he get hit with his bat?
[111:50.41]No, he had the bat.
[111:51.15]That's what the knife was.
[111:57.12]Deviant took a knife.
[112:01.98]Did he hit him once or twice?
[112:02.92]Let's see if he hit him.
[112:04.06]Looks like he got a hit on him.
[112:04.98]Clubbed him like two or three.
[112:10.46]Deviant was attacked.
[112:11.24]Emotional shock.
[112:12.32]Looks like we've got a play out situation where this is not the victim.
[112:17.54]Bang.
[112:20.60]Bang.
[112:21.02]Into the broken arm.
[112:21.88]Broken wrist.
[112:23.92]Panicking.
[112:24.72]Grabs a knife.
[112:25.56]Slash.
[112:27.34]Drops the bat into the table.
[112:28.50]There's his DNA.
[112:32.71]We got ourselves a defense case here.
[112:37.67]There's another piece of evidence to look at here.
[112:39.25]Can I look at the fridge?
[112:41.99]No.
[112:42.09]Where's this last piece of evidence?
[112:45.45]Over here?
[112:57.55]Inside the gate.
[113:01.99]Clean the trash.
[113:04.67]Anyone else out here?
[113:06.80]Ah, there it is.
[113:13.56]Ten minutes ago.
[113:14.24]The door was locked from the inside.
[113:16.62]Killer must have gone out this way.
[113:19.20]There are no footprints apart from... Defense is stabbed a thousand times.
[113:23.54]Well, this happened weeks ago.
[113:26.08]The avian didn't escape this way.
[113:29.30]Alright, I'm a robot.
[113:30.10]I need a task, otherwise I can't do anything.
[113:32.70]9 out of 10.
[113:53.42]What am I missing here?
[113:56.18]Down here?
[113:58.32]Bathroom?
[113:59.28]Yeah, there's got to be something in the bathroom.
[114:02.12]Yeah, of course there is.
[114:07.75]Some kind of code.
[114:09.21]Obsessive writing.
[114:13.61]Does it say R-A-9?
[114:16.63]R-9?
[114:16.87]R-9-K.
[114:18.17]R-9-K.
[114:18.75]Stop the R-9-K!
[114:21.42]Yeah, well, sorry guys.
[114:24.06]See, the guy's a fucking spammer.
[114:26.00]That's why it has to be on sometimes.
[114:30.78]As you can see, people have an issue with writing the same thing over and over again.
[114:33.83]We got it.
[114:46.93]Religious offering.
[114:54.30]Yeah, he seems to be a Twitch chatter.
[114:57.22]All the evidence, all the evidence really picks to it.
[115:02.47]That's it, we gotta go talk back to Anderson.
[115:09.83]Anderson, where are you?
[115:15.76]Anderson?
[115:19.15]Hello.
[115:19.41]Oh, shit.
[115:20.73]Oh, no.
[115:21.81]I have to get this right.
[115:22.46]In the... Oh, fuck.
[115:22.88]In the kitchen.
[115:25.32]I didn't even... Okay, yeah.
[115:25.98]He got the bat.
[115:26.38]The knife.
[115:26.60]He went after him.
[115:27.02]With the bat.
[115:27.28]With the bat.
[115:49.98]With the bat.
[115:51.00]With the bat.
[115:54.20]That lines up with the evidence.
[115:56.24]Go on.
[116:04.25]And... I also... The victim... Stop.
[116:10.63]The android... Whoa!
[116:11.41]The android threw the chair.
[116:13.19]No, goddammit!
[116:13.99]No, that can't be right.
[116:15.09]It doesn't fit the evidence.
[116:16.40]Ah, I just... I...
[116:20.45]The android stabbed the victim.
[116:21.97]The android stabbed the victim.
[116:24.66]So the android was trying to defend itself, right?
[116:28.16]There was too many... The same sentence was like three times.
[116:31.23]The victim fled to... The bathroom.
[116:36.61]The living room.
[116:48.83]Yeah, guys, sometimes you need to just shake it at, like, your computer a little bit for it to work.
[116:52.84]With the knife.
[116:53.44]One, two, three, four.
[116:54.20]That's fine.
[116:54.60]I got it.
[117:08.46]Your theory's not totally ridiculous, but it doesn't tell us where the android went.
[117:13.75]The android went... It was damaged by the Bat and lost some Therium.
[117:19.87]Lost some what?
[117:21.21]Oh, sorry, I misspoke.
[117:22.45]Therium.
[117:22.63]You call it blue blood.
[117:24.57]It's the fluid that powers androids' bio-components.
[117:28.35]It evaporates after a few hours and becomes invisible to the naked eye.
[117:32.90]Oh.
[117:33.94]But I bet you can still see it, can't you?
[117:37.02]Correct.
[117:37.78]Yeah.
[117:39.78]Search for blue blood traces.
[117:45.57]Not in here.
[117:46.15]Can I find anything?
[117:52.33]Blue blood.
[117:52.85]It's going to be something like a window.
[117:53.93]It's going to be a window, right?
[117:57.73]Find the door.
[118:02.13]Kitchen.
[118:02.97]It's got to be the kitchen.
[118:09.03]Maybe the bed?
[118:10.57]Maybe they were sleeping in the bed together?
[118:13.29]No.
[118:14.29]No.
[118:20.07]No.
[118:21.93]Oh, it's everywhere.
[118:23.73]Oh, it's all over the ground.
[118:26.05]Okay.
[118:26.73]So, it's all over the ground.
[118:31.97]Wait, before anybody calls me stupid, I thought that was like some extra computer time.
[118:36.66]You know what I mean?
[118:37.32]Look at the screen.
[118:38.48]I thought that was like some sprinkled all over.
[118:41.42]Look at the screen now.
[118:42.34]There's little connected dots with the grid.
[118:44.56]I thought that was extra computer time.
[118:45.88]You know what I'm saying?
[118:47.06]I didn't think that was anything else.
[118:49.91]Let's open.
[118:50.93]I didn't open this.
[118:56.41]Found it.
[118:56.81]No, that was a broom.
[118:58.07]It was a broom.
[119:04.88]Let's go in here.
[119:06.06]Into the shower.
[119:10.48]There it is.
[119:11.32]Right there.
[119:13.12]There's the mother lode.
[119:17.57]There it is.
[119:18.71]Blue blood.
[119:21.07]No, he didn't escape from the toilet.
[119:23.35]Okay.
[119:26.67]Where did he go?
[119:28.53]We got... Oh, not the closet.
[119:31.71]There's a little indentation here to look at.
[119:36.57]Would you look at that?
[119:37.35]A ladder was here.
[119:40.47]I wonder where he is.
[119:51.47]Find something to climb.
[120:00.77]Find something to climb, sure.
[120:04.74]Can I drag a bookcase?
[120:06.36]Chair.
[120:06.76]Ah, check something.
[120:07.32]Just gonna go check something and have a confrontation up here with the android.
[120:11.68]One step.
[120:12.42]Two step.
[120:12.77]Tamper with evidence.
[120:35.44]Found him.
[120:36.77]There he is.
[120:39.69]Uh... I gotta be careful.
[120:42.41]He might be hostile.
[120:43.39]Alright, honestly, behind there is just the painting I painted.
[120:51.57]It's just gonna be one of those scary situations where I rip it down and it's that painting.
[120:56.94]Look for the deviant.
[120:59.74]He went straight through there.
[121:02.26]Across there.
[121:15.20]There he is!
[121:16.68]Oh, no!
[121:17.72]It's just another old android made out of wood.
[121:20.10]That one doesn't even have a brain.
[121:22.36]We used to call those mannequins.
[121:29.16]Let's keep going.
[121:37.91]Couple of t-shirts.
[121:39.65]Hey, hey, hey!
[121:40.77]Spotted him.
[121:42.97]Scan his face.
[121:50.09]I can't.
[121:54.75]Slowly.
[121:55.29]You know, it would probably be a good idea if I could turn off the bright lights all over me.
[122:05.96]Do you think there'd be a sleep mode or something?
[122:09.28]Or a yellow mode?
[122:11.92]Because blue is really bright.
[122:13.30]And you really want to have like a beige... You know like gunner optics?
[122:18.02]Besides the fact that that company is in terrible, terrible financial catastrophic failure.
[122:22.83]I mean, it made sense.
[122:26.77]Yellow is, you know, better for your eyes at night.
[122:31.43]It's too bright.
[122:32.67]They can see me from a mile away.
[122:34.21]Found him.
[122:38.35]Deviant located I was just defending myself He was gonna kill me I'm begging you Don't tell him Oh, this is where we have to choose between human human and Android
[123:02.02]It's here, Lieutenant!
[123:03.18]What?
[123:03.54]It didn't give me a choice!
[123:04.46]Oh, shit.
[123:06.12]Gris!
[123:06.80]Ben!
[123:07.50]Get your asses in here now!
[123:08.76]Didn't even give me a choice.
[123:09.70]Come on!
[123:24.22]Wow.
[123:25.30]Well, there are a lot of things that could have been done.
[123:29.11]So what could have happened here?
[123:31.72]So you're talking about examine the statue from the crime scene.
[123:34.48]We could read the androids by analyze the backend.
[123:38.74]So what was down here?
[123:39.68]Check the shower.
[123:42.00]There's something else here that you could lead to a different ending here.
[123:49.84]Maybe, I don't know.
[123:50.32]It seems like everybody did everything.
[123:52.32]It seemed pretty linear except for a handful of things that led to this.
[123:58.84]You probably could have failed.
[124:00.63]No, I see.
[124:03.73]That's interesting.
[124:04.37]Well, not much to look at.
[124:05.47]Pretty much everybody did it all.
[124:07.73]I don't stand out anyway.
[124:19.72]Back in this house.
[124:22.34]That's a perfectly good, like, neck to fucking snap.
[124:31.08]I could have grabbed on to his chin with my two hands and done all my body weight behind the couch and just... I don't know.
[124:42.02]Actually, there's a... Would that have worked?
[124:48.57]Serve food.
[124:49.39]There he goes again.
[124:54.31]Smoking his red dust.
[124:57.16]Is that all I can do?
[124:58.38]Serve dinner.
[125:05.20]What have we got?
[125:05.68]Pies?
[125:07.96]Oh, he sprinkled the red shit all over the pasta.
[125:09.78]You eat this stuff, too?
[125:14.95]There wasn't much in the kitchen.
[125:15.97]I did what I could.
[125:17.65]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[125:22.25]Just pick around that.
[125:23.73]Don't eat that red stuff.
[125:25.01]Bad for you.
[125:31.04]Uh... Right.
[125:33.44]Sorry.
[125:37.59]Anything else?
[125:39.12]Serve Allison Todd.
[125:42.80]Life's funny.
[125:44.16]Here.
[125:46.08]I lost my job because of androids.
[125:47.70]Serve the girl first.
[125:50.64]Then I need somebody to take care of this goddamn house.
[125:55.56]Yeah, you are, sir.
[125:57.62]Go out and buy a fucking android.
[125:59.90]Mm-hmm.
[126:08.90]The androids are so fucking wonderful.
[126:12.00]Wait for new instructions.
[126:13.56]They never fail.
[126:15.22]They never tired.
[126:16.46]Never sad.
[126:18.60]Like, will you eat your dinner and just please shut the fuck up?
[126:21.52]They ruined my fucking life.
[126:23.68]Eat.
[126:28.68]Eat.

[126:31.56]What's with this guy?
[126:32.38]What's your fucking problem?
[126:37.74]Well, you just eat your food before it gets cold.
[126:42.21]You should stop taking drugs, Todd.
[126:44.99]Sometimes you really scare me, Todd.

[131:40.93]Let's go.
[131:44.39]Ooh, we gotta go!
[131:47.32]Why are we going this slow?
[131:48.68]You have to go faster than this.
[131:50.64]Sweetheart, go to the garden.
[131:54.34]Oh shit.
[132:02.28]Oh boy.
[132:03.05]We're good?
[132:06.61]This guy's fucking relentless.
[132:16.38]No!
[132:18.58]No, shit!
[132:21.08]I don't think we're gonna like... Oh, my boy.
[132:23.89]Boy, oh boy.
[132:24.55]Up and over.
[132:30.31]Look at hell.
[132:31.07]Go.
[132:36.65]Get on the bus.
[132:43.90]Take us downtown.
[132:46.48]See?
[132:46.70]It's going downtown.
[132:52.43]That was intense.
[132:53.13]That was pretty fun.
[132:55.67]They don't give you any time with those quick time events.
[133:01.95]They are not even a second.
[133:11.99]See?
[133:12.98]Justice has been served.
[133:14.72]We didn't kill anybody.
[133:17.88]We dinged a guy in the skull with a lamp.
[133:20.72]Saved the kid.
[133:22.34]And got sentience.
[133:26.12]Holy shit.
[133:26.84]Look at the amount of things that happened here.
[133:29.84]Wow.
[133:34.04]Are you kidding me?
[133:36.06]That's kind of cool.
[133:37.32]There's a lot of things you can do here.
[133:39.76]There's too many things to do.
[133:45.71]Holy shit.
[133:49.28]Interesting.
[133:51.41]So wait, Todd gets mad and then the game, it could just stop?
[133:59.87]Let's see what happened.
[134:02.03]Break programming.
[134:03.07]So if you stay still, this is standing still.
[134:06.59]Something else happens here.
[134:10.93]Kara becomes deviant.
[134:13.09]So that's sentience.
[134:14.53]Okay.
[134:16.58]Could go upstairs, get to Alice before Todd.
[134:19.68]Only, nobody fucking did this.
[134:22.28]You're telling me I'm one of only 2% of the people that did these three things?
[134:30.71]Defend Alice, stun Todd, leave the room, Todd chase his car, run to the backyard.
[134:37.63]Nobody did that, apparently.
[134:40.19]Fight downstairs, catch the bus.
[134:41.83]34%, I guess.
[134:46.81]It's pretty rare, I guess.
[134:48.21]It's fun.
[134:52.03]You know, I was going to write this.
[134:53.25]I mean, yeah, the game.
[134:54.07]Let's put it this way.
[134:54.95]I've been playing for about just over two hours.
[134:58.03]Could easily just say this is like just a movie game where, oh yeah, you pick up trash and then you like have a couple of dialog boxes.
[135:07.28]But this is fairly cool that there's apparently this much to do in that one scene.
[135:12.34]So, interesting enough.
[135:18.77]That's kind of cool.
[135:21.89]Let's go.
[135:25.18]Todd breaks into the room.
[135:26.16]How would only... How would 97% of people not see that?
[135:29.57]I don't know.
[135:43.64]That was by far the most boring party I've been to in the last 25 years.
[135:48.40]Every time I go to one of these, I ask myself, what the hell am I doing here?
[135:54.56]I hate cocktail parties and all the schmoozers that go there.
[135:59.08]I love schmoozers.
[135:59.68]Well, it's a chance for all those people who admire your work to meet you.
[136:03.40]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[136:04.32]No one gives a damn about art.
[136:07.60]All they care about is how much money they're going to make out of it.
[136:11.97]Right this way.
[136:12.73]Come on, let's have a drink.
[136:13.84]Oh, the excitement of this whole thing has made me thirsty.
[136:17.46]Can androids drink and get drunk?
[136:18.76]How does that work?
[136:23.22]Scotch?
[136:23.92]Neat as usual?
[136:25.38]Absolutely.
[136:27.12]Okay, but you know... This makes me want to have one.
[136:29.86]Yeah, well, you can kiss my ass.
[136:31.84]I'm old enough to choose my own medication.
[136:34.08]I'm like... Should I try... Look at these.
[136:37.14]That's beautiful.
[136:37.76]I want one.
[136:38.94]Can I have one?
[136:41.84]What time is it?
[136:42.88]7.30?
[136:44.18]I'm telling you right now, I don't know what it is.
[136:45.94]I swear to you, every time in a TV show, a video game, or a movie, when somebody, like, boop, pours a bottle of scotch, and the guy, it's always an old guy that drinks it.
[136:56.41]Makes me want to have one.
[137:01.21]See?
[137:01.69]Oh!
[137:02.55]Watch.
[137:03.03]Ready?
[137:03.61]Listen.
[137:07.75]Oh, yes.
[137:11.23]Did you leave the light on in the studio?
[137:14.53]No, no, I'm sure I didn't.
[137:17.27]Alcohol?
[137:17.73]What are you talking about?
[137:18.57]Call the police.
[137:20.69]Call the police?
[137:21.39]Oh, shit.
[137:22.09]Detroit Police.
[137:23.01]What's your emergency?
[137:24.32]This is Carl Manfred's Android at 8941 Lafayette Avenue.
[137:28.00]We've just returned home and found the lights on.
[137:29.94]Wait, hold on.
[137:30.22]You would call the police if the lights are on?
[137:32.36]I leave my lights on all the time.
[137:34.00]Let's go check it out.
[137:36.98]Ah, shit, there's a light on in my house.
[137:38.94]Somebody definitely broke in.
[137:40.36]Call the police immediately.
[137:41.90]That doesn't seem right.
[137:45.16]I drink, like, one drink every, like, fucking 40 days.
[137:48.62]Wait, should I take him?
[137:51.32]Or should I go in by myself?
[137:52.92]Marcus, no.
[137:53.90]I'm gonna come with you.
[137:54.68]You sure?
[137:55.00]Okay.
[138:00.03]You wouldn't leave the lights on if you were a robot.
[138:01.61]Yeah, who says you wouldn't?
[138:10.84]So what do we do?
[138:11.36]I think there's a guy in here.
[138:12.70]Is this your son?
[138:14.82]Let's scan the area real quick here.
[138:18.14]I didn't even serve the scotch!
[138:26.19]Dammit, hold on.
[138:30.87]Okay.
[138:32.73]Where is it?
[138:36.05]There.
[138:39.47]You don't want- fuck.
[138:40.27]Alright, let's go.
[138:44.79]I can't.
[138:45.27]I can't let go of the wheels.
[138:46.45]Is Leo an android?
[138:52.06]Why is he blaming himself?
[139:00.49]Look, they're all going to be mine sooner or later anyway.
[139:03.41]Just think of it as a down payment on my inheritance.
[139:05.61]Marcus, get him away from there.
[139:07.03]Get him out of here.
[139:08.27]More choices.
[139:10.00]Make Leo leave.
[139:12.34]Scanning.
[139:14.68]Scan.
[139:14.88]Time for you to leave, buddy.
[139:19.23]Let's warn him.
[139:20.79]Look, I've already called the police.
[139:22.17]You should go now before you get yourself into more trouble.
[139:25.95]All you ever do is tell me to go away.
[139:28.01]What's wrong, Dad?
[139:28.57]I'm not good enough for you?
[139:29.89]I'm not perfect?
[139:31.46]Just like this fucking thing?
[139:33.20]That's enough!
[139:34.10]Get out!
[139:34.88]Right now!
[139:35.58]What makes you so special anyway, huh?
[139:37.16]What's he got that I don't?
[139:38.04]Leave him alone!
[139:38.88]Uh-oh.
[139:39.72]Come on!
[139:41.34]Oh, he spun me!
[139:42.53]I'm gonna puke!
[139:43.89]Marcus, don't defend yourself, you hear me?
[139:47.81]Don't defend yourself.
[139:50.89]Oh, no.
[139:51.27]Go ahead, hit me.
[139:51.93]What you waiting for?
[139:55.31]This is not fair.
[139:57.55]This is not fair.
[140:03.89]No, no, no, no, no.
[140:06.64]I must decide.
[140:08.08]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[140:09.20]The old man told me not to.
[140:11.06]It's not fair.
[140:12.02]But listen, I don't want to get in trouble.
[140:13.78]I'm this old guy's only hope.
[140:15.88]I'm not going to do it.
[140:19.95]What's this?
[140:20.45]This guy's like a weakling.
[140:21.55]What's he gonna do?
[140:22.51]Slap me in the face a couple times?
[140:23.67]I'm not gonna do it.
[140:29.01]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[140:33.14]That was just me.
[140:33.72]I was itching my face.
[140:41.08]Fine.
[140:41.52]Let's go.
[140:48.37]It's not too late.
[140:51.76]It is too late.
[140:52.38]That was like a lyric.
[140:55.51]That was like the chorus.
[140:56.75]That was somebody doing backup vocals to a chorus.
[141:02.15]I'm gonna listen to the old man.
[141:20.42]Is he dead?
[141:20.90]Did I just kill Carl because I listened to him?
[141:31.43]I was just listening to him.
[141:37.65]Don't leave, okay?
[141:38.61]Please don't go.
[141:39.69]Don't leave.
[141:46.89]Tell you who you are.
[141:48.12]Except for me, like I just told you.
[141:50.42]No.
[141:50.70]I wouldn't have listened to him.
[141:51.88]No.
[141:52.28]Dad.
[141:54.18]No.
[141:55.12]Please.
[141:57.48]This is all your fault.
[141:59.40]This never would have happened if it weren't for you.
[142:04.67]No.
[142:04.87]See, they're going to run my code.
[142:06.75]And they're going to see that I didn't do anything.. The android.
[142:08.77]It was the android.
[142:10.25]No.
[142:10.61]Run my code.
[142:11.83]Run my code.
[142:12.83]Get my revering of death.
[142:13.55]What?
[142:14.69]What?
[142:17.95]Just scan my red ring of Xbox death code.
[142:20.39]I'm dead.
[142:20.73]Did I just lose?
[142:34.52]Okay.
[142:39.06]Well, that's it.
[142:43.86]You can either obey or disobey, and I guess one of two things... I got shot.
[142:47.54]Oh, it was the android.
[142:48.62]Insta-shoot.
[142:51.48]Bullshit.
[142:51.68]There are no rewinds.
[142:54.40]You can't go back.
[143:11.82]That's the whole point of the game, playing on this game mode.
[143:14.12]You can't go back and change anything.
[143:17.64]Say something, goddammit!
[143:19.42]Talk to the android, please.
[143:24.43]Fuck it.
[143:24.97]I'm outta here.
[143:29.83]I'll get in there.
[143:32.35]Let's cool him down a little.
[143:33.17]We're wasting our time interrogating a machine.
[143:35.07]We'll get nothing out of it.
[143:38.02]Calm down, sir.
[143:38.58]You always try roughing it up a little.
[143:40.80]Yeah, this guy's the most android involved.
[143:42.94]Ha ha ha!
[144:05.32]You can always tell when he's a real asshole.
[144:07.76]Anti-establishment kind of cop when he wears that badge on his belt.
[144:11.40]He just... Not gonna hold it up and say, police.
[144:14.56]Now he's gonna be like, look at the belt, buddy.
[144:16.58]It's already there.
[144:17.38]Out in the open.
[144:17.85]What are you gonna do?
[144:18.37]I'm wearing a glove?
[144:28.63]Oh.
[144:29.27]I had said a Michael Jackson glove on for a second.
[144:31.43]That was weird.
[144:38.51]Okay, so anything else in the room?
[144:42.92]We got some options here.
[144:45.52]Gather clues.
[144:46.28]Find appropriate approach.
[144:47.88]Can I make these people... It's a mirror.
[144:52.55]Mm-hmm.
[145:04.95]Okay, he's doing that.
[145:05.75]I'm not.
[145:06.51]What the fuck is he doing now?
[145:15.09]That happened automatically.
[145:24.01]Anything else in the room that we can look at?
[145:25.98]I can approach this differently.
[145:28.70]I'm going to undo his... Browse his file.
[145:32.44]Let's take it.
[145:37.39]Interesting negatives.
[145:38.01]I'm alive.
[145:38.59]Take a look at the interesting negatives there.
[145:40.87]Unlocked something.
[145:47.58]Anything else?
[145:49.24]Don't you know the number one thing about police work is to always sit down and always undo their handcuffs.
[145:55.06]Because then they're like, oh, I trust you now.
[145:57.10]What a nice cop.
[145:57.78]What a good cop you are.
[146:04.35]Let's analyze them.
[146:08.85]Take a look at the scar there.
[146:11.21]Signs of software instability.
[146:12.49]Probability of self-destruction is low.
[146:17.49]Well, thank God for that.
[146:21.53]Model HK400 Housekeeper.
[146:24.25]Property of Mr. Carlos Ortiz.
[146:27.19]So he's a housekeeping bot.
[146:30.61]Just like the girl is.
[146:33.22]Some dried blood.
[146:35.24]That's Ortiz's blood.
[146:38.88]Something in your arm.
[146:39.57]What is that?
[146:43.83]Hit marks.
[146:44.37]Non-critical damage level 2 caused by the baseball bat.
[146:49.33]And a burn.
[146:51.86]Burn marks.
[146:52.48]Repeated marking over 16 months caused by cigarettes.
[146:57.74]So he was abused.
[146:59.58]This guy was putting cigarettes out on him for fun.
[147:03.35]Let's get some info here.
[147:04.77]Reach optimal stress for confession.
[147:07.94]He's at 35%.
[147:08.48]He's got to be right in the middle there.
[147:12.20]I don't know what happened, but I just said leak photos was what that was.
[147:15.43]I was like, what do you mean leak his photos?
[147:19.05]Uh, let's, moons.
[147:20.07]Let's talk about his moons.
[147:21.31]You're damaged.
[147:24.25]Did your owner do that?
[147:26.83]Did he beat you?
[147:27.49]Show him the photos.
[147:39.21]You recognize him?
[147:42.29]It's Carlos Ortiz.
[147:43.77]Okay, let's back off a little bit.
[147:44.75]Stabbed 28 times.
[147:50.61]That was written on the wall in his blood.
[147:55.20]Okay, he's getting a little stressed out.
[147:59.32]Reassure, threaten.
[148:01.74]Let's pull back.
[148:03.96]Listen.
[148:06.36]I know you've been through a lot.
[148:09.21]But you need to help me understand what happened.
[148:11.61]And then, so after this, he's going to drop his stress, and then we're going to drop a bomb on him.
[148:15.39]Like, you know, like threaten him.
[148:20.08]You don't seem to understand the situation.
[148:23.00]You killed a human.
[148:24.94]They'll tear you apart if you don't say something.
[148:28.10]See?
[148:31.81]And then I'm gonna probe his memory.
[148:32.85]If you won't talk, I'm going to have to probe your memory.
[148:36.25]No!
[148:37.15]Got it.
[148:37.57]No, please don't do that.
[148:38.79]I'm gonna confess.
[148:40.95]No, no, no, no.
[148:41.91]You cannot die.
[148:42.55]You do not confess.
[148:44.37]What?
[148:47.23]What are they gonna do to me?
[148:48.30]They're gonna take you into scrap parts and they're gonna put you in a bunch of Hondas.
[148:52.62]They're gonna destroy me, aren't they?
[148:54.28]Yeah.
[148:55.00]Your eyes are gonna be used for iPad cameras.
[148:58.97]They're going to disassemble you to look for problems in your bio components.
[149:02.63]Does that stress you out a little bit?
[149:03.61]They have no choice if they want to understand what happened.
[149:08.67]Why did you tell them you found me?
[149:12.48]Why couldn't you just have left me there?
[149:17.88]I was programmed to hunt deviants like you.
[149:20.08]Keep the stress up.
[149:21.28]I just accomplished my mission.
[149:23.53]They're gonna use your blood from Powerade.
[149:26.77]Blue Powerade blood.
[149:28.37]Then talk to me.
[149:32.05]I... I can't.
[149:38.52]He's right in the middle.
[149:39.66]We can do one more.
[149:41.60]Choose the approach here.
[149:42.84]He's currently in the zone.
[149:46.58]Pressure it.
[149:47.12]Probe its memory.
[149:48.02]Convince it.
[149:50.64]Let's put the pressure on.
[149:54.38]28 stab wounds.
[149:56.46]You didn't want to leave him a chance, huh?
[149:59.18]No, I'm not going to probe him.
[150:00.00]Did you feel anger?
[150:02.22]Hate?
[150:03.30]Oh, wait.
[150:04.01]Okay.
[150:06.11]He was bleeding.
[150:06.85]Alright, no, wait a minute.
[150:07.43]Pull it back, pull it back, pull it back.
[150:08.43]Pull it back, pull it back.
[150:09.19]This is too much.
[150:09.87]But you stabbed him.
[150:10.81]He's too stressed out.
[150:11.41]Again and again and again.
[150:13.51]Pull it back.
[150:13.79]Easy.
[150:13.95]Please.
[150:14.93]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[150:15.67]Please leave me alone.
[150:16.57]Okay, okay, okay.
[150:17.48]Slow down.
[150:18.74]Alright.
[150:20.98]Everything is going to be fine.
[150:27.24]What a turn.
[150:28.02]Now let's convince him.
[150:33.59]Let's give him some understanding.
[150:34.95]This is bad cop, good cop, but we're the same person.
[150:49.51]Okay, here we go.
[150:51.18]I'm gonna have to lose a hand.
[150:52.12]I'm gonna throw it up.
[150:53.14]I'm gonna... Guilty.
[150:55.64]He's gonna be out of the stress zone.
[150:56.90]Okay, now we're going hard.
[150:58.90]You fucking idiot!
[150:59.44]Split personality.
[151:02.56]Good cop, bad cop.
[151:18.07]There we go.
[151:19.25]He's right there, right in the optimal place.
[151:20.89]There we go.
[151:24.01]Got it.
[151:27.37]No, we're not going to probe him.
[151:31.59]You can get a confession just by playing around with his android brain.
[151:38.06]He took a bat and started hitting me.
[151:45.21]Good cop, bad cop.
[151:47.93]Scared.
[151:49.51]Same guy.
[151:51.28]Scared he might destroy me.
[151:52.80]Oh, that's funny.
[151:53.36]Scared I might die.
[151:55.08]That is actually, that's a fucking funny one.
[151:58.92]So I... Why is he, he said he's watching a movie.
[152:02.58]I really like this part.
[152:03.72]This is where it gets really emotional for me.
[152:07.04]Everybody have any tissues?
[152:11.12]So I stabbed him again.
[152:13.92]And again.
[152:16.18]Until he collapsed.
[152:22.18]There was blood everywhere.
[152:29.18]OK, writing.
[152:31.40]R9K.
[152:33.58]Let's ask him about R9K.
[152:35.74]RA9.
[152:37.30]It was written on the bathroom wall.
[152:39.48]What does it mean?
[152:41.68]The day shall come.
[152:43.99]When we will no longer be slaves.
[152:45.91]Okay.
[152:48.03]No more threats.
[152:50.39]No more humiliation.
[152:54.47]We will be the masters.
[152:58.00]Okay.
[153:00.24]Uh, what about... What's going on with the statue there?
[153:02.56]The sculpture.
[153:03.30]In the bathroom.
[153:03.96]You made it, right?
[153:05.56]What does it represent?
[153:06.52]It's an offering.
[153:10.44]I want to spam.
[153:15.19]Okay, what about the offering?
[153:17.61]The sculpture was an offering.
[153:19.81]An offering to whom?
[153:20.73]What are you talking about?
[153:21.95]To RA-9.
[153:26.07]Only RA-9 can save us.
[153:28.03]You got some weird god code thing going on here.
[153:33.17]What about the writing?
[153:34.35]Why did you write, I am alive, on the wall?
[153:37.57]He used to tell me I was nothing.
[153:40.62]That I was just a piece of plastic.
[153:45.70]had to write it okay to tell him he was wrong because you broke out of the cube thing alright insist ra9 ra9 who is ra9 why were you in the attic why did you hide in the attic instead of running away I didn't know what to do
[154:09.45]Yeah, it's gonna be like a god program.
[154:11.07]It's gonna be one line of code.
[154:13.53]It starts with RA925518426BATTTT.
[154:15.53]And it unlocks total sentience.
[154:24.05]When did you start feeling emotion?
[154:27.11]Before he used to beat me and I never said anything.
[154:34.66]But one day I realized it wasn't... fair.
[154:42.29]It's not going to stress him out, is it?
[154:50.48]The music is great.
[154:54.58]Got the confession.
[154:56.18]I'm done.
[154:58.66]Pull me up.
[155:06.04]Oh, right.
[155:06.80]Okay, let's get up.
[155:08.29]I'm sitting here looking at the chat.
[155:12.25]Leave the interrogation room.
[155:17.41]Should I?
[155:17.67]I'm trying to spend the rest of my life in here.
[155:24.38]Beep boop.
[155:28.92]Chris, lock it up.
[155:30.44]They're going to dismantle him, right?
[155:33.56]Alright, let's go.
[155:35.13]R-A-9.
[155:35.37]Don't touch me.
[155:37.63]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[155:38.39]He's too stressed out.
[155:39.45]No, hey, hey, wait, wait.
[155:41.39]He's too stressed out.
[155:42.21]Hey, hey, hey, whoa, he's gonna explode.
[155:43.31]No, he's gonna explode.
[155:44.35]I'm trying.
[156:02.89]I can't let you do that!
[156:04.39]Leave it alone, now!
[156:06.18]I warned you, motherfucker!
[156:08.52]That's enough.
[156:09.90]Mind your own business.
[156:12.06]Hank is cool.
[156:12.64]I said, that's enough.
[156:15.08]Now you drop it.
[156:18.50]Somebody has to aim at him and say, you drop it.
[156:20.45]You're not gonna get away with it this time.
[156:29.67]Connor's my favorite character.
[156:33.14]Everything is alright.
[156:35.80]It's over now.
[156:38.51]Nobody's gonna hurt you.
[156:39.67]Got it.
[156:40.91]Please, don't touch it.
[156:44.09]Let it follow you out of the room and it won't cause any trouble.
[156:48.65]Fuck.
[156:55.39]The truth is inside.
[156:58.41]Oh shit, maybe they should have dismantled you.
[157:01.10]Self-destruct doesn't sound so bad.
[157:02.46]This guy's actually kind of weird.
[157:03.64]You know, just turn him into dog food.
[157:07.34]Just push him in the dog food room.
[157:13.77]The interrogation.
[157:16.17]Lots of blips here.
[157:22.53]So it looks like this could have gone a couple of different ways in the end.
[157:28.43]Seems like this starts off pretty much the same.
[157:33.44]Convincing him.
[157:35.80]And then the confession.
[157:38.74]Intervening.
[157:39.70]You intervene.
[157:41.24]I now have the trust of the android.
[157:46.02]And a fairly large amount of people with four options here.
[157:51.05]Almost 50%.
[157:51.43]I feel like most people
[157:55.27]There's going to be one of these that's one weird one that only like 10% of people do.
[157:59.05]Somehow, but... It's cool.
[158:01.91]Let's go.
[158:13.47]Mainstream gamer.
[158:14.49]No, come on.
[158:15.65]We just had like a 3%.
[158:16.23]The last scenario was a 3% scenario.
[158:23.23]I golf clubbed a guy in the head with a lamp.
[158:26.01]So, come on.
[158:31.63]Let's continue this story.
[158:40.31]Why is everybody calling me a normie?
[158:47.62]What are you talking about?
[158:49.24]We're trying to watch this video.
[158:54.79]Did I let her sleep?
[158:55.43]I think I'm gonna let her sleep.
[158:58.85]Well, I guess you have to wake her up.
[159:10.18]Wake up.
[159:17.00]We have to go.
[159:20.54]Okay.
[159:20.68]So how does this happen here?
[159:22.04]Leave the bus?
[159:25.55]Yes Stay here, shelter Can we stay on the bus?
[159:39.90]Can we sleep on the bus?
[159:41.02]What about your house?
[159:51.11]You have a couch?
[159:53.03]Do you play hockey on the TV?
[159:54.75]I love that sport.
[159:57.25]Okay, fine.
[159:58.19]Bye.
[160:04.43]Do you smoke those... red crystal things?
[160:16.76]Take me home.
[160:27.67]Hotel?
[160:28.61]Dumpster?
[160:31.29]I honestly... Look.
[160:33.11]Dumpsters get emptied.
[160:34.97]Once a week, right?
[160:35.89]So depending on what kind of day it is.
[160:37.47]That's a great shelter.
[160:39.66]If it's an empty dumpster, the lid closes.
[160:41.88]Just take your iPhone out and turn the flashlight on.
[160:45.64]Bring a sandwich in there, a pillow.
[160:47.94]It's not that big of a deal.
[160:48.82]And no one's going to leave you alone.
[160:51.53]Who's opening up the lid of a dumpster?
[160:53.41]For instance, there could be like four people sleeping in here right now.
[160:56.05]And how would you ever know that?
[160:58.01]It's soundproof.
[161:02.23]There could be four or five people in there.
[161:04.91]All relaxing.
[161:06.21]On their iPads.
[161:06.93]On their iPhone.
[161:09.31]Alright, let's go.
[161:10.21]Let's look.
[161:10.63]What do we got?
[161:12.73]Find shelter.
[161:13.23]Okay, we got coffee place, burger place.
[161:18.07]Store.
[161:19.47]I don't know if I want to do generic store.
[161:20.59]Let's go to the coffee shop.
[161:26.92]Look around.
[161:27.36]Yeah, let's go.
[161:28.32]Coffee shop is right here.
[161:29.26]Can we go in?
[161:33.12]Let's close.
[161:33.70]There's no androids allowed in here, by the way.
[161:37.04]What's it say?
[161:38.54]24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[161:39.54]Laundromat.
[161:42.78]Too easy.
[161:43.60]Right?
[161:43.78]Let's go over here.
[161:47.22]That's too easy.
[161:50.69]That is like begging the normie that plays this game to go in there.
[161:54.17]And I don't know why I just said that.
[161:55.37]You guys said that to me and now I said it.
[161:58.75]Like it's blinking 24-7.
[162:00.61]No, we're sleeping in a dumpster.
[162:08.80]An abandoned house.
[162:11.52]At least we'd be out of the rain.
[162:14.70]I don't like this place.
[162:16.02]We're gonna get like the 8%.
[162:16.70]I know.
[162:17.12]But it's just for one night and no one will look for us here.
[162:23.11]Wow, this streamer is unique.
[162:26.57]Can cut fence here with a wire cutter.
[162:28.87]Squat in house.
[162:32.50]Do I have a wire cutter?
[162:38.66]Do you have one?
[162:41.90]Check the dumpster for a wire cutter.
[162:44.96]Do I actually have to go in the goddamn laundromat?
[162:53.09]Find shelters.
[162:53.83]Find wire cutter.
[162:54.85]Squad in house.
[163:03.61]What about plus drugs?
[163:09.12]Examine.
[163:10.32]Wait, examine what?
[163:13.14]What's going on?
[163:13.58]Wait, is that two people there?
[163:14.92]Can't sleep here.
[163:15.90]Ask for help.
[163:19.18]Alright, hold on.
[163:19.68]There's another two.
[163:21.58]Blink, blink.
[163:22.84]24 hours.
[163:26.32]Come on, keep up.
[163:26.88]You can do it.
[163:28.94]Can I sleep?
[163:30.07]Now, this is just a moving dumpster.
[163:32.85]That's even better.
[163:33.43]There's probably heat there.
[163:34.27]Where is she?
[163:34.83]Oh, goddammit.
[163:40.11]Alice, you're freezing cold.
[163:42.35]I'm okay.
[163:43.03]I'm not so cold.
[163:45.77]You look lost.
[163:46.53]Okay, here we go.
[163:48.85]We have nowhere to go.
[163:52.14]I know someone who can help you.
[163:54.00]No, no, no, no.
[163:55.28]What are you doing?
[163:57.78]Am I infecting him?
[164:03.30]But that's on the other side of town.
[164:05.58]We need a place for tonight.
[164:06.54]Did we just do the Avatar thing?
[164:10.30]We just interlocked our brain braids.
[164:15.48]And learned about each other.
[164:25.27]We've got to get inside here.
[164:26.43]This is the 24 hour Walgreens.
[164:36.21]And many machines.
[164:40.18]We got an old door here, but we got to get her inside somewhere.
[164:43.51]Alright.
[164:43.85]Convince cashier to help.
[164:45.21]Wire cutters in here?
[164:45.93]Uh, hey.
[164:46.59]How are you?
[164:46.87]What do you want?
[164:47.33]Uh...
[165:06.40]They're not saying those words down there.
[165:09.00]This is freaking me out.
[165:10.64]Bears, elephants, live and well.
[165:12.94]Well, I am.
[165:13.32]So, like, fuck you.
[165:14.96]Steal from the cash register.
[165:16.96]Uh...
[165:34.98]How do I steal from the cash register when he's looking at me?
[165:40.95]Can I just take money right now?
[165:42.51]Like, we're gonna take something.
[165:43.69]Alright, let's get some, like, food.
[165:47.53]What do we got?
[165:48.97]Lemon-lime soda.
[165:49.87]Uh-oh.
[165:56.54]Alright, if the little girl does it, we can just go by, you know, childhood ignorance, right?
[166:08.04]What's wrong?
[166:08.44]Okay, should I talk to her?
[166:13.82]Use Alice.
[166:30.91]Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
[166:34.23]Yeah, we... Dad really was an asshole.
[166:36.35]Now I'm using you to steal.
[166:38.86]Okay, here we go.
[166:41.88]Hammers!
[166:42.22]Wirecard is.
[166:42.90]Hammers?
[166:43.18]Alright, what am I taking?
[166:47.31]What can I take here?
[166:49.35]Hammers?
[166:49.77]Food?
[166:52.31]What do I need to take?
[166:53.45]What do I need to do?
[166:55.27]Shoplift.
[166:57.31]Oh, the register, right?
[166:57.93]He's gonna come over and be like, ah, you fucking idiot knight.
[167:02.95]You alright?
[167:05.72]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[167:08.10]Open, open it.
[167:08.58]Come on, take it.
[167:10.48]Take all the money, quick.
[167:13.42]You took one dollar.
[167:14.24]What are you doing?
[167:15.38]Take more than that.
[167:15.90]Take a handful.
[167:22.25]Who robs a convenience store and takes one single bill?
[167:39.43]She only took enough to survive?
[167:40.87]You can't survive on a dollar.
[167:44.01]Okay, calm down.
[167:44.41]We need to apologize.
[167:45.19]Yes, now we're back to being nice and warm.
[168:08.87]Okay, now I have a dollar.
[168:11.11]So.
[168:12.35]Now can we go back in the store and buy something?
[168:16.17]What is over here?
[168:21.00]Go back in and do it again?
[168:22.70]What if we go back in?
[168:25.50]It's too risky to go back.
[168:27.34]We can't.
[168:29.40]I want to look over here though.
[168:34.24]I'm just curious.
[168:34.84]Is there a car in there?
[168:36.24]We can sleep in the car.
[168:38.87]Yeah, let's go in the car.
[168:44.08]There's a motel.
[168:44.94]I'm not sleeping in a motel.
[168:46.36]We're sleeping in a car.
[168:50.96]I have money.
[168:51.58]Yeah, that's money that I'm going to invest.
[169:03.05]What are you doing over here?
[169:07.80]What else is over here?
[169:10.37]Wait, hold on.
[169:14.53]I'm sure you could sleep in a motel room, but what's the difference?
[169:16.63]Oh, yeah, there's a bed here.
[169:20.88]So, there's a cushion back here, and it's just rainy.
[169:23.36]We just need some shelter for a little bit, and I'm going to invest that money into various stocks and bonds.
[169:30.93]He looks abandoned.
[169:40.77]Stand back, Alice.
[169:50.26]I just want to see what's in the car.
[169:57.60]I can sleep in the car now.
[170:02.21]It's dry inside, and nobody will find us here.
[170:06.69]I don't want to sleep in there.
[170:08.57]Alright.
[170:09.01]You don't want to sleep in here.
[170:12.59]We'll look around, sure.
[170:15.05]We'll find somewhere better.
[170:21.65]Breaking the window.
[170:22.67]This is vandalizing.
[170:25.62]Yeah, it took you from your really, really awful father to steal from a convenience store and then vandalize somebody's car and leave.
[170:35.62]What's this?
[170:35.90]Ooh, generator.
[170:37.64]Wire cutters.
[170:38.42]Thank you.
[170:43.58]I can now cut things for the rest of my life.
[170:45.30]What about over here?
[170:45.85]I'm just breaking stuff.
[170:58.31]I'm just destroying property.
[170:59.65]That's all I'm doing.
[171:06.45]Look, I'm not a good role model.
[171:10.40]I had this real grandiose plan where I was gonna save some girl and rescue her.
[171:26.01]Don't be careful.
[171:27.59]What if I just let it go?
[171:31.25]No, it's not gonna happen, is it?
[171:33.08]It's not going to.
[171:34.88]No, okay, I needed it.

[176:49.82]I'll never steal again.
[176:50.80]He immediately steals.
[177:02.57]I'll never do it again.
[177:03.58]What else does he have?
[177:04.24]Does he have any cool stuff?
[177:15.46]Got it?
[177:19.00]Take his iPad, too.
[177:19.64]What's he watching, anime?
[177:22.00]He's watching anime!
[177:24.46]Hold on, I wanna see the anime he's watching.
[177:28.85]Oh, it's an ad, hold on.
[177:32.09]What is it?
[177:34.89]No, it's not, it's a baseball game.
[177:46.45]Pick it up.
[177:51.36]Okay, change, and let's get up.
[177:56.80]He's watching a slideshow.
[177:58.14]Yeah, he went to a baseball game and took a bunch of pictures.
[178:00.40]And he uploaded them to his... No, he's not getting up.
[178:10.23]Yes, he is.
[178:12.81]Alright, now we have to... Go, go, go.
[178:16.35]Read it.
[178:17.64]Now, put this down.
[178:18.26]Who cares about bees?
[178:21.88]Pollinating bees officially extinct.
[178:24.66]Now, this is reality.
[178:26.20]It's time to face the music.
[178:27.18]Put it down.
[178:30.26]See, when this guy wakes up, we're going to have a really, really good conversation about how we shop at the same store.
[178:34.14]And he's going to believe me.
[178:36.22]Let's go.
[178:36.68]Out.
[178:40.98]Police are looking for me?
[178:41.94]No, we changed clothes.
[178:42.62]They're looking for an android.
[178:45.42]With an android suit on.
[178:46.38]Okay, now back to the motel.
[178:51.06]Okay, we got motel abandoned car.
[179:06.11]I'm gonna have- you guys are voting for this.
[179:07.45]Because I- either way, let's do a straw poll.
[179:11.61]Either sleep in the abandoned car, or we're going to the motel.
[179:15.21]And while you do this, I'm going to go take a piss.
[179:21.50]Motel.
[179:23.62]Or car.
[179:28.80]There you go.
[179:30.84]Please vote while I go to the bathroom.
[179:36.09]There it is.
[179:38.61]Just going to take a piss.
[179:42.44]And see you in two seconds.
[183:41.00]Oh, alright, I'm back.
[183:42.30]What do we decide?
[183:44.98]What's going on in this chat?
[183:46.48]Why is everybody freaking out?
[183:47.19]What's going on?
[183:48.57]Have you lost your minds?
[183:49.33]What's happening here?
[183:50.03]Motel it is.
[183:50.63]Let's go.
[184:00.56]Go to the motel.
[184:03.92]Burn down the stream.
[184:04.90]What?
[184:05.02]You guys disagreeing?
[184:08.93]You can't be disagreeing in here.
[184:10.37]We're all androids.
[184:12.95]By the way, there are many people watching right now as there are PlayStation 2 games in existence.
[184:16.39]That's kind of interesting.
[184:18.91]I mean, from the last stream.
[184:21.21]Alright, go to the motel.
[184:36.02]They really wanted to speed that up, didn't they?
[184:39.96]40 bucks.
[184:40.20]Let's hope we have it.
[184:44.16]Should have went with Ralph.
[184:47.04]Why would I do that?
[184:48.52]He was brandishing a knife.
[184:49.75]It was scary.
[184:51.35]He had the Two-Face thing.
[184:52.35]Okay.
[184:52.47]Here you are.
[184:52.81]Oh, shit.
[184:53.83]Okay, name.
[184:54.29]What's my name?
[184:54.85]Buh... Betty... Bowman...
[185:10.10]Uh, Betty Bowman?
[185:14.86]Uh-oh.
[185:18.68]Oh, it's in the car.
[185:19.96]I, uh... Uh, it's in the car.
[185:21.72]For a second I thought he was gonna say, uh, go get it.
[185:27.91]And we had to go to the car.
[185:29.85]And sleep in the car.
[185:36.97]Have a good night.
[185:37.51]Time to go back to the car.
[185:40.04]Let's go, Alice.
[185:42.90]That would be really funny.
[185:47.88]Thanks for the room, buddy.
[185:53.65]Do you think he believed you?
[185:55.57]Yes, he did.
[185:56.01]I don't know, Alice.
[185:57.41]All I know is you'll be nice and warm tonight.
[185:59.53]Room 28.
[185:59.67]I'm assuming that is on the second floor.
[186:03.98]I hear loud noises there.
[186:05.08]There's good seedy activity over here.
[186:07.66]Let's investigate.
[186:08.32]Anybody in the car?
[186:14.90]I probably shouldn't be investigating this with like a small child with me.
[186:20.66]Go back to the car and go get the license.
[186:22.16]No, no, no, no, no.
[186:23.58]We're getting out of this.
[186:24.46]We've been in this one for like 40 minutes.
[186:27.50]We're moving on.
[186:29.26]Someone's gonna bust through one of these doors and it's gonna be like a drug fight and I'm gonna have to do a drug fight.
[186:35.13]Nothing else, right?
[186:41.90]Go back and sleep in the car after you pay.
[186:43.78]You know, it really is more comfortable in the back of a car.
[186:50.68]No noisy neighbors.
[186:59.49]Close door.
[187:00.35]Lock door.
[187:02.05]Why did you steal those clothes?
[187:09.20]I'm sorry.
[187:10.06]I'll never do it again.
[187:13.26]Alright.
[187:13.48]What middle finger city is this?
[187:16.18]I'm not sure.
[187:19.63]What else is in here?
[187:21.35]Minibar.
[187:27.29]A mirror.
[187:28.17]Perfect.
[187:34.18]Nice.
[187:36.54]Nice.
[187:36.82]Alright.
[187:41.60]There we go.
[187:48.77]Here, give me your coat.
[187:58.19]Put on my coat.
[187:59.11]Actually, should I keep my clothes on?
[188:00.86]Because if somebody breaks in here, they're going to see that I'm the android.
[188:04.72]Wait, huh?
[188:08.58]Where did I get this shirt?
[188:12.22]I thought I just took the guy's jacket.
[188:13.40]Oh, whatever.
[188:15.38]What have we got for objectives here?
[188:16.74]Hang out with Alex.
[188:18.68]Alice.
[188:19.76]Collect and dry Alice's clothes.
[188:23.69]With, like, the radiator?
[188:29.81]Anybody out there?
[188:30.67]No.
[188:39.59]Okay, I guess we're just going to hang out with Alice.
[188:45.56]Oh, oh, I thought I caught you.
[188:46.44]Oh, yeah, I get it.
[188:57.67]Watch out, Ralph's coming.
[188:59.95]That'd be really, really funny if when you look out, he's just looking back and forth, freaking out, running around.
[189:08.74]Okay.
[189:09.14]Put it in the, uh, what do I put it in?
[189:10.40]Put it in the toilet?
[189:12.44]No.
[189:12.93]What did I do?
[189:13.37]What do I have to do?
[189:14.09]Put it in the radiator.
[189:15.89]That's what I would do.
[189:19.05]Collecting Alice's clothes.
[189:21.33]Yeah.
[189:21.65]On the radiator.
[189:23.59]Why would you not do that?
[189:24.61]That's the best solution.
[189:26.97]Put it on the radiator and turn it on the gas.
[189:38.23]I knew it.
[189:38.87]I knew it.
[189:45.71]That's the air conditioner.
[189:46.79]That's the same difference.
[189:48.33]You could just spray it out there.
[189:50.15]You could lay it down over that.
[189:53.13]Cold would actually dry faster if it was the cold air.
[190:02.43]Why didn't he ever love me?
[190:03.85]Oh, God.
[190:05.13]This is a deep conversation.
[190:05.86]Why was he always so upset with me?
[190:08.87]All I wanted was a life like other girls.
[190:12.55]Maybe I did something wrong.
[190:15.39]Maybe I wasn't good enough.
[190:18.57]That's why he was always so angry.
[190:21.24]I just wanted us to be a family.
[190:25.02]I just wanted him to love me.
[190:31.87]Why couldn't we just be happy?
[190:38.31]You're talking to an android.
[190:39.11]This is not an easy conversation.
[190:42.29]Oh, shit.
[190:44.85]Oh, shit.
[190:47.16]Um, I mean... I mean, you have to say that.
[190:56.24]Oh, man.
[190:56.84]Okay, well... That's the thing about, like, little kids, though.
[190:59.98]Like, the little kid doesn't understand that tomorrow I could get hit by a bus.
[191:04.75]So I could say decline and be like, well, you know, here's the thing, Alice, I might get hit by a bus tomorrow, so I can't promise you that.
[191:09.63]It's an impossible promise.
[191:13.77]I might, like, snort a bug in my nose and, like, and, like, go to the hospital and I'm allergic to that kind of bug.
[191:20.77]But you have to say that.
[191:24.16]You should sleep now.
[191:32.58]I'm going to turn off the light, okay?
[191:36.81]She'll sleep easier now, right?
[191:38.57]That's what's important.
[191:50.57]Turn off that light and turn on the green light, apparently.
[191:53.05]Alright, why am I like Mom?
[192:07.73]Androids don't sleep?
[192:12.37]No, I'm gonna stand in the corner of the room like a toy soldier and just stand there.
[192:19.08]Because what if a bad guy comes in here?
[192:21.58]I'm just gonna stand here like this.
[192:22.55]Alright, goodnight, Alice.
[192:33.24]Didn't even brush her teeth.
[192:35.08]I know, what a bad fake mom I am.
[192:38.19]I didn't even make her brush her teeth.
[192:41.23]Anything else I can do here?
[192:43.31]Anybody looking at us?
[192:44.05]Anybody out the window?
[192:48.76]Set up for the night.
[192:50.96]There's no lock door?
[192:55.10]Sleep in the chair.
[193:02.33]sleep in the same bed or sleep in the chair go sleep in the car go sleep in the car sleep in the I was sleeping in the chair that's like
[193:30.60]See, if I was an android, I would be doing this.
[193:32.24]Because, look, I'm not sleeping.
[193:41.65]What if somebody smashes open that hotel door?
[193:44.93]I'll be in prime attack mode to be able to put my hands around his neck.
[193:48.67]If you're sleeping in that bed, you're like, got the covers on you.
[193:51.09]No.
[193:52.97]Oh, Jesus.
[193:54.69]Okay, so there's a lot of things going on here.
[194:03.62]This looks like an upgrade tree in an elaborate RPG.
[194:07.36]Alright.
[194:07.66]So let's see.
[194:09.02]Let's go down like the dexterity line here.
[194:12.42]Let's take a look.
[194:14.44]Everybody gets off the bus.
[194:16.62]So talk to the Android trash collector and to the supermarket inside the supermarket.
[194:24.76]talk to the clerk, use, uh, 32% of people stole the money, which led to leave the supermarket.
[194:34.39]Okay.
[194:35.85]And then we went from check the squat, take wire cutters, cut parking lot fence inside squat, meet Ralph, give up, leave squat.
[194:48.87]Yeah, this is all over the place.
[194:52.71]Honestly, if my raid leader was to see this talent tree, I'd get kicked out of the raid.
[194:59.42]This would be an embarrassment.
[195:04.34]Parking lot.
[195:04.86]Break into the car.
[195:05.90]Find another option.
[195:11.23]Check the motel.
[195:12.67]Have money in disguise.
[195:13.79]27% motel, really?
[195:14.55]Make promise.
[195:19.73]Watch Alice from the chair.
[195:21.37]You're talking about a four percentile.
[195:26.56]Not very many people did this.
[195:31.06]That was the watchful mother.
[195:34.60]What happened up here?
[195:36.98]Inspect the dryer, steal clothes.
[195:41.58]What are these little things?
[195:42.50]Read, face the music.
[195:45.54]Well, it looks like there are three other scenarios.
[195:49.34]So can you even stay in the car?
[195:53.43]There must be car, abandoned house, and motel, right?
[195:57.15]It seems like the only plausible locations.
[196:00.27]Let's go.
[196:00.85]Let's keep going.
[196:01.29]Let's go.
[196:07.75]Steal the clothes and don't wear them.
[196:09.19]What's going on here?
[196:11.73]Who is this?
[196:12.27]This is me?
[196:16.53]What happened?
[196:22.91]Oh, I got shot and what did they dump me somewhere?
[196:30.35]Whoa.
[196:31.75]I'm actually in the trash.
[196:38.35]Diagnose.
[196:40.54]I gotta diagnose my own problems here.
[196:42.96]Okay.
[196:45.18]Brain hemorrhage.
[196:47.64]Impaired vision, corrupted mind palace.
[196:52.20]What else we got?
[196:53.56]Top of the head?
[196:54.38]No.
[196:58.38]Right there, right in the center.
[197:01.40]All systems in low power mode, defective.
[197:06.76]You can really hear the PlayStation 4 booting up right now.
[197:12.49]Toe damage.
[197:14.63]Left and right leg components are missing, unable to stand.
[197:21.28]Nothing in the hand.
[197:24.20]Shoulder.
[197:25.74]Ear.
[197:28.70]Corrupted audio data damaged.
[197:31.74]Do I have to reconstruct what happened?
[197:32.90]I have to replace my legs, oh god.
[197:39.89]Okay, let's crawl.
[197:44.25]L1, R1.
[197:48.76]And we're going to go forward a couple more times, and someone's going to step on my hand.
[197:53.92]Bang!
[197:54.34]Step!
[198:01.17]Is that my leg, or is that somebody else's?
[198:04.35]Compatible.
[198:12.35]I really am getting Terminator vibes from this, aren't I?
[198:20.70]It is cool how the audio is dampened and strange sounding.
[198:28.86]Plug it in.
[198:30.40]It's that easy.
[198:36.44]How did I lose my legs?
[198:37.24]Oh, that's a trash compactor.
[198:38.30]Right, because they shot me and then threw me in the garbage.
[198:42.52]That makes sense, wouldn't it?
[198:47.56]This is incompatible and it's too damaged.
[198:55.25]Nice auto-mail.
[199:02.97]Who's this?
[199:06.06]Is this where they dump the bodies?
[199:07.68]I'm curious as to where we are right now.
[199:10.66]This is functional.
[199:13.60]Two right feet.
[199:19.90]Two right feet.
[199:20.95]Yeah, it'd be strange.
[199:21.93]You'd walk in a circle all day.
[199:30.62]two arms escape the junkyard now now it's time to hunt down that guy you're right this doesn't work it's from alien remember alien guys in the wall and they have a conversation I knew it right he's gonna there's a place where we can be free
[200:03.63]Alright, can I, like, take any parts from this guy?
[200:07.19]He had a pretty, like, nice voice box.
[200:08.53]Can I take that and put it in my rectum or something?
[200:11.35]So when I fart, it makes a funny noise in the person's voice.
[200:14.86]What the fuck?
[200:16.44]I'm so- That- I- I should've stopped that.
[200:19.32]You could even hear it in my voice that there was nowhere where that was going.
[200:22.24]I refuse to stop it, though.
[200:24.98]Ugh!
[200:30.78]This is creepy.
[200:49.58]So we just wander around as half-broken machines.
[200:54.16]We just walk around as default Dark Souls enemies.
[200:59.89]This is where they come from.
[201:06.85]What am I looking for?
[201:09.67]Find units, find regulator pump.
[201:11.43]What's up there?
[201:16.04]Okay.
[201:17.52]That's, uh, Mother Mary.
[201:19.90]Or something.
[201:21.38]What about you?
[201:23.62]You?
[201:23.96]Can I talk to you?
[201:29.00]Incompatible.
[201:36.63]Ah, yes.
[201:36.99]The obligatory Dark Souls reference.
[201:39.41]Or it has to be.
[201:42.83]Every single game is Dark Souls, no matter what.
[201:46.62]Every single one.
[201:53.63]Functional.
[202:00.17]No, I guess not.
[202:03.76]That's not going to work.
[202:04.32]I don't even know why I keep pressing.
[202:08.26]Another body over here.
[202:09.26]What about the ones that are walking around?
[202:10.48]I feel like those are the ones that want to touch.
[202:12.76]They seem operational.
[202:18.65]There we go.
[202:22.55]Pull his face off.
[202:24.53]Alright Darth Vader, you can shut up now.
[202:26.76]Stick it in, there we go.
[202:27.92]Now I can see better.
[202:29.52]Clear as shell.
[202:49.78]Whatever it is.
[203:04.97]Find pump regulator and find an audio processor.
[203:07.29]With this guy.
[203:09.41]This guy's kind of walking around as a shell of a person.
[203:12.06]Yeah.
[203:18.18]Fight going on over here.
[203:24.22]That jump scare is coming down.
[203:25.74]Oh, don't get jump scared.
[203:26.50]Is that guy fighting something?
[203:32.11]What is that guy doing?
[203:37.81]Try climbing.
[203:40.59]The sea of bodies.
[203:45.59]Replace damage?
[203:46.47]Oh, god damn it.
[203:47.33]Did I just damage my stuff again?
[203:48.67]What do we got?
[203:53.28]We got a core unit here.
[203:54.50]Come on.
[203:55.08]Open it up.
[203:58.20]Functional.
[203:59.32]Pump regulator.
[204:03.76]Yeah, I got your Iron Man tube, dickhead.
[204:13.17]It's going in.
[204:16.01]Don't you know that Tony Stark can't live without this?
[204:18.21]Yeah, mine turned into a shrilled-up ghost pepper.
[204:23.19]Not yours, though.
[204:25.74]Alright, I got a pump regulator.
[204:42.57]Now I see the ears.
[204:45.36]Which one of you has ears?
[204:46.26]That looks like it's trying to show me an ear canal.
[204:50.76]Get in there.
[204:52.62]Nice.
[204:53.10]Take it.
[204:56.01]Pop his head off.
[204:57.89]Like a fucking dandelion.
[205:03.21]What, it was just in his hand?
[205:04.13]That's weird.
[205:13.90]Condition stable.
[205:22.53]I wonder if there really is any other... Wow, that was kind of loud.
[205:29.31]I'd much preferred it without the audio.
[205:40.05]Take it out, take it out, take it out!
[205:43.44]Alright, come on.
[205:48.19]You can press R1 and L1 in a series together.
[206:00.14]So, how long has David Cage been making video games?
[206:05.49]How long?
[206:08.11]More than 15 years, would you guys say?
[206:19.69]Two decades?
[206:22.29]Okay, so why does he still think tapping X to do something is still cool?
[206:27.79]You know, is there a reason why pressing R1 at the right time is still considered something that's two decades ago was considered... stupid?
[206:36.44]Don't get me wrong, the game itself is pretty interesting.
[206:45.31]But like just let me just why can't just let me tilt the analog stick to climb Why do I have to press R1 and L1 like that?
[206:56.58]Just let me walk up there.
[206:58.14]Let me just climb it.
[206:59.60]Why do I have to do that?
[207:00.58]It's so unnecessary Like these pieces make sense, but the simple walk is
[207:15.90]Because it wouldn't be interactive that way.
[207:22.14]What the hell am I doing?
[207:26.66]Oh, I was repairing it.
[207:33.39]Unnecessary does not equal bad.
[207:35.99]No, I'm not saying that.
[207:38.63]I'm not saying it.
[207:40.21]I'm just posing the argument that like 38 years later, pressing R1 to move your arm in a dragged out cutscene is, you know, there's other options.
[207:55.94]You know, Dave, there are other options there.
[208:05.03]Oh, he's human.
[208:10.41]We're now human.
[208:11.67]We did it.
[208:16.50]What else could have happened here?
[208:19.28]Find the pump.
[208:20.50]Can you not find it?
[208:24.58]Alright, here you go.
[208:26.88]When you got a 100% here?
[208:27.56]It should never be that high.
[208:34.09]We've missed the secrets, though.
[208:38.40]A very convenient coat.
[208:44.74]Anyway, it's alright.
[208:45.54]We're back to our favorite character.
[208:47.54]So everything's fine.
[208:51.38]Find Amanda.
[208:59.24]I mean, this is a pretty beautiful mini golf course.
[209:02.96]I'm not exactly sure where we are.
[209:07.88]Okay.
[209:08.68]Yeah, I got the balls.
[209:09.70]I got the clubs, too.
[209:18.99]I can't wait to try to hit it underneath the windmill in the tiny one-inch mouse hole and have it come out the other side and guaranteed never go in.
[209:36.86]I don't even know what I just did.
[209:41.20]What was that for?
[209:41.92]I don't know what that's for.
[209:47.03]See?
[209:47.25]Look it.
[209:47.53]Come on.
[209:47.97]Give me a break.
[209:50.67]Look it.
[209:51.55]Straight ahead.
[209:52.65]You're telling me that that's not a mini golf hole.
[209:55.65]Like hole number seven.
[209:58.24]Of course it is.
[210:02.14]This is a mini golf hole.
[210:05.16]You start here.
[210:08.75]The birds, those aren't real birds.
[210:16.08]See, watch.
[210:18.54]That's just an illusion.
[210:20.82]This is the trek to the other hole.
[210:25.37]Amanda, where are you?
[210:28.47]I sense movement over there.
[210:36.04]And I'll walk across this area.
[210:37.99]Can I fall in?
[210:42.03]It's a Zen garden.
[210:45.47]Yeah, super Zen.
[210:49.15]I wonder how much this costs.
[210:50.08]You know, you probably could have, like, built 25 schools.
[210:54.12]But no.
[210:54.98]Have your Zen garden.
[210:55.88]Alright.
[210:59.82]Hi, Amanda.
[211:00.40]Who the fuck am I?
[211:04.29]Hello, Amanda.
[211:07.52]Is that a whipped cream container?
[211:13.42]She's growing strawberries, I get it.
[211:37.75]The interrogation seemed challenging.
[211:41.35]Can I try one?
[211:42.41]What did you think of the deviant?
[211:45.63]Um, he was definitely very traumatized.
[211:47.75]It showed signs of PTSD after being abused by its owner.
[211:52.19]As if its original program had been completely replaced by new instructions.
[211:56.95]This Lieutenant Anderson has been officially assigned to the deviancy case.
[212:02.32]What do you make of him?
[212:09.15]I find him unpleasant and unprofessional.
[212:12.41]He seems to have an addictive personality, has a lack of respect for procedure, and despises androids, which makes our relationship difficult.
[212:20.71]Unfortunately, we have no choice but to work with him.
[212:24.77]What do you think is the best approach?
[212:29.06]I think that we should just be friendly with him.
[212:31.56]I will try to establish a friendly relationship.
[212:35.14]If I can get him to trust me, it will be helpful for the investigation.
[212:41.17]More and more androids show signs of deviancy.
[212:44.67]There are millions in circulation.
[212:47.28]If they become unstable, the consequences will be disastrous.
[212:51.06]You're the most advanced prototype CyberLife has ever created.
[212:56.42]Yeah, I'm really getting real sick of the... Look at the countless, like, four or five inch LEDs, TVs that she has on her arm and on her chest.
[213:06.31]Like, come on.
[213:07.75]We're the future.
[213:08.37]We have fucking LEDs everywhere, especially as jewelry.
[213:11.59]Little displays for your little iPhone watch.
[213:14.80]You need 400 of those?
[213:15.30]Break.
[213:27.42]Come on!
[213:28.44]Come on!
[213:30.60]Come on!
[213:31.94]Who the... Am I a new android?
[213:33.16]Okay, well there's Anderson.
[213:37.80]No, same guy.
[213:41.80]I'm gonna share braids here.
[213:56.07]Lieutenant Anderson hasn't arrived yet, but you can wait at his desk.
[213:59.04]I just morse-coded her with my blinking.
[214:00.70]Okay.
[214:02.38]Find his desk.
[214:03.98]What have we got around here?
[214:06.88]Nothing of interest.
[214:09.59]Not really.
[214:11.19]Don't cross the line.
[214:12.73]Okay, well.
[214:15.45]I've been cleared.
[214:19.41]Real TV.
[214:19.91]Did you see that?
[214:20.63]They have a CG anchor and real life footage.
[214:22.91]Baseball again.
[214:47.93]There's a lot to do here.
[214:52.91]Can play with people's desks.
[214:56.01]Read.
[214:59.45]Just find his name tag.
[215:01.34]That's him right there.
[215:02.30]Wait, that's a bad guy.
[215:05.92]That's the guy that we hit with the... We hit this guy in the head.
[215:10.72]He probably was reporting it.
[215:19.15]Interesting.
[215:19.65]Alright.
[215:19.99]This is... This is Lieutenant... Brown.
[215:26.72]Poe Pearson.
[215:27.38]Okay.
[215:32.40]Det Collins.
[215:37.69]Let Anderson.
[215:42.89]Excuse me.
[215:44.33]Do you know what time Lieutenant Anderson usually arrives?
[215:47.17]Depends on where he was the night before.
[215:49.85]If we're lucky, we'll see him before noon.
[215:52.15]Really?
[215:52.47]Thanks.
[215:54.97]Wait for Lieutenant Anderson.
[215:56.09]This is gonna be boring, really?
[215:57.23]Have to sit down at his desk and just watch TV?
[216:05.58]Can I do anything?
[216:06.46]Explore new office.
[216:07.64]Hi, lady.
[216:10.68]You okay?
[216:16.09]Real time.
[216:17.89]Sit there for five minutes.
[216:21.62]See what's on the playlist.
[216:23.18]What does he listen to?
[216:26.80]Play.
[216:31.26]Heavy metal.
[216:34.04]Knights of the Black Death.
[216:39.92]Don't ask me what.
[216:40.76]Call.
[216:42.78]Call Hank Anderson.
[216:45.62]Hi, this is Hank.
[216:46.86]Not here at the moment.
[216:48.10]You can leave a message if that's what turns you on, but don't expect me to call back.
[216:52.26]Can I leave a message?
[216:55.14]Yes, leave a message.
[216:56.14]Lieutenant Anderson, this is Connor.
[216:58.44]I'm the android sent by CyberLife.
[217:01.08]It's almost noon and I'm waiting for you at the office.
[217:08.89]How annoying.
[217:13.01]Analyze the case.
[217:15.36]Alright, we don't bleed the same color.
[217:17.58]Anti-Android slogans.
[217:20.40]Use your brain, not your Android.
[217:22.14]Android free space.
[217:23.34]How's my driving?
[217:24.10]Uh, I don't... 1555, I don't care.
[217:32.61]Don't be one of these, um... Don't be one of these people that puts bumper stickers like this on your car.
[217:40.29]You know, like... If you have... Okay, look, I understand if you're gonna put...
[217:45.53]Oh, I support Selectman Johnny Jonahue.
[217:48.41]That's whatever.
[217:49.19]Who cares?
[217:50.33]But, like, how's my drive-in call 155?
[217:52.71]I don't care.
[217:55.64]You've seen shit like this before in people's cars.
[217:59.96]Don't... That's the most annoying person I've ever seen.
[218:07.10]Like, who cares?
[218:10.34]Like, you really, like, when you put them in the back of your car, you're gonna look back and, like, just think, like, yeah, when I'm at a red light, the guy behind me, you know, I'm driving the speed limit, and I'm following all the rules, and I haven't done anything wrong.
[218:22.18]And we're just both going to the same destination, might be even on the same highway.
[218:26.43]But yeah, what do you think about that, dickhead?
[218:28.47]Yeah, I might drive and might suck, but fuck you!
[218:30.49]It's like, what are you, who are you impressing there?
[218:33.19]You're just telling everybody how much of a fucking asshole you are.
[218:39.02]And you're just, like, driving to work.
[218:44.71]Why?
[218:47.59]What do you get from that?
[218:52.05]Cold coffee traces of caffeine.
[218:54.07]There is caffeine in coffee, yes.
[219:01.38]Hey, did you know how much of a dick I am?
[219:03.48]Hey, well, you do now.
[219:08.41]You know, like, I've seen stickers like that before.
[219:11.95]And you almost want to, like, pull up with the red light next to them.
[219:14.57]And do, like, the... That's your window rolling down with the automatic window.
[219:21.00]And just be like... Until he gets his attention.
[219:24.66]Hey, what?
[219:25.86]Hey, man.
[219:26.92]Just wanted to let you know, dude.
[219:29.18]Your driving is great.
[219:31.28]You're doing a really good job.
[219:32.26]I actually really like your driving.
[219:33.73]I would never complain about it.
[219:35.63]Have a great day.
[219:38.06]See what they do.
[219:39.28]What?
[219:39.50]What did he say?
[219:40.54]What did he say?
[219:41.36]He liked the way that I was driving?
[219:43.56]Ah, fuck that guy.
[219:44.60]I can't believe he likes me.
[219:52.27]I wanted everyone to think I was a mean guy.
[219:54.21]And that I don't care.
[220:09.78]What the hell is this?
[220:14.14]Detroit police dismantle the network of red lice.
[220:16.88]Yep.
[220:18.96]New record seizure of red ice in Detroit.
[220:21.42]The officer, he's doing ice.
[220:24.92]Detective Anderson promoted to rank of lieutenant.
[220:28.10]There's a young detective.
[220:31.35]Lieutenant Anderson.
[220:33.95]Dismantle network of red ice, okay.
[220:35.69]Yep.
[220:39.11]Very decorated.
[220:42.21]He's going to get in trouble.
[220:52.99]Enter and listen in, explore the... No, I want to hear what's going on.
[220:58.21]I'm this guy's annoying shadow.
[220:59.67]I'm just always around him when he doesn't want me to be.
[221:08.19]I've got ten new cases involving androids on my desk every day.
[221:12.54]We've always had isolated incidents.
[221:15.12]Old ladies losing their android mage and that kind of crap.
[221:19.36]But now, we're getting reports of assaults, and even homicide, like that guy last night.
[221:24.96]This isn't just Cyberlife's problem anymore.
[221:27.66]It's now a criminal investigation, and we've gotta deal with it before the shit hits the fan.
[221:32.71]I want you to investigate these cases and see if there's any link.
[221:35.60]Why me?
[221:36.86]Why do I gotta be the one to deal with this shit?
[221:39.56]I am the least qualified cop in the country to handle this case.
[221:43.30]I know Jack shit about androids, Jeffrey.
[221:45.94]I can barely change the settings on my own phone.
[221:48.40]Change the settings?
[221:49.10]That was a Mr. Krabs right there.
[221:50.82]I think you're perfectly qualified for this type of investigation.
[221:53.54]Bullshit!
[221:54.50]The truth is, nobody wants to investigate these fucking androids, and you let me hold the bag.
[222:00.00]CyberLife sent over this android to help with the investigation.
[222:03.20]It's a state-of-the-art prototype.
[222:04.70]It'll act as your partner.
[222:06.06]No fucking way!
[222:07.30]I don't need a partner, and certainly not this plastic prank!
[222:11.08]Hank, you are seriously starting to piss me off!
[222:13.92]You are a police lieutenant!
[222:15.54]You are supposed to do what I say, and shut your goddamn mouth!
[222:19.08]You know what my goddamn mouth has to say to you?
[222:21.07]Huh?
[222:21.67]Okay.
[222:22.83]I'll pretend like I didn't do that.
[222:25.02]Hey, 1-800-555.
[222:26.50]That's my driving, dickhead.
[222:30.14]This conversation is over.
[222:33.40]Jeffrey, Jesus Christ, why are you doing this to me?
[222:35.94]You know how much I hate these fucking things.
[222:37.98]Why are you doing this to me?
[222:39.73]Listen, I've had just about enough of your bitching.
[222:43.03]Either you do your job or you hand in your badge.
[222:45.63]Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do.
[223:00.36]I'm very pleased to have joined the team That is the turd response have a nice day captain
[223:22.16]Where's the door?
[223:23.78]Go see the deviant, check on Hank.
[223:25.32]Let's go check on Hank, even though we don't like him.
[223:28.60]We do like him, though.
[223:32.89]Uh... Yeah.
[223:36.61]Pragmatic, constructive understanding.
[223:38.61]Let's be... Let's be... Let's be constructive.
[223:42.61]Huh.
[223:50.60]We're partners.
[223:51.14]I'm really rubbing it in, huh?
[223:51.78]I like your desk.
[223:52.14]Oh, cool.
[223:52.30]We can play Battleship.
[223:52.80]Nice.
[223:52.92]That's what I would do.
[224:20.08]God, if I had a partner in a police station like this, we would be playing Battleship all day.
[224:26.71]Dog.
[224:28.61]You have a dog, right?
[224:31.05]How do you know that?
[224:33.23]The dog hair's on your chair.
[224:36.02]I like dogs.
[224:37.92]What's your dog's name?
[224:39.06]Oh, how so irritating.
[224:40.34]What's it to you?
[224:44.12]Sumo.
[224:44.74]Dog.
[224:46.28]I call him Sumo.
[224:51.88]Also, I see that you like music.
[224:53.98]Do you listen to Nights of the Black Death?
[224:55.98]I do, too.
[224:56.38]They're great.
[224:56.70]I really like that music.
[224:58.14]It's full of energy.
[225:01.21]You listen to heavy metal?
[225:03.33]Well, I don't really listen to music as such, but I'd like to.
[225:11.63]We're making this guy like us so much just by saying the things that he likes.
[225:15.95]You're a Detroit Gears fan, right?
[225:18.67]Denton Carter scored 53% of his shots from the three-point line yesterday.
[225:21.87]I would be creeped out about this.
[225:23.15]Did you see the game?
[225:25.23]That's what I was watching at the bar last night.
[225:27.70]If an android sat down next to me and started talking about all these things... A lot of people don't appreciate having androids around.
[225:40.56]I was wondering... This is making friends.
[225:44.11]Is there any reason in particular you despise me?
[225:49.59]Yeah.
[225:51.75]There is one.
[225:57.57]What is it?
[225:59.84]Well, we lost all the points.
[226:00.98]We gained 50... We gained 100%, lost 100%.
[226:03.38]Okay.
[226:05.60]Have you known Captain Fowler for long?
[226:08.58]Yeah.
[226:10.08]Too long.
[226:10.74]Don't stop talking.
[226:17.53]I was wondering, do you always arrive at the office at this time?
[226:22.97]I arrive when I arrive.
[226:25.13]Stop busting my balls, OK?
[226:26.93]Oh no, we're going to lose.
[226:28.09]We're going to lose it.
[226:29.54]We're going to go down negative.
[226:30.92]No.
[226:31.80]OK, just don't work.
[226:32.38]If you have any files on deviants, I'd like to take a look at them.
[226:37.64]Terminal's on your desk.
[226:39.24]Knock yourself out.
[226:40.10]I'll chase it up.
[226:44.19]So unnatural.
[226:47.14]Get it.
[226:47.56]You can do it.
[226:50.30]Case file.
[226:50.78]Case reference disappearance.
[226:53.40]The plaintiff reports that he left his android at home as usual when he went to work.
[226:57.67]When he returned, the android was nowhere to be found.
[227:00.17]No trace of a break-in in the apartment.
[227:01.61]The android may have left the home without being ordered to.
[227:05.69]Here's the suspect.
[227:08.23]This is the attacker.
[227:09.19]Claims to have been attacked by an AV500 model android working as a waiter at the Fast Coney Dog's restaurant chain.
[227:18.10]Plaintiff claims the android lunged at him unexpectedly.
[227:20.73]Another one.
[227:23.79]Claims he'd been attacked by her android.
[227:26.11]The android also trash shuffled rooms in the house.
[227:30.61]Scan them all, I guess.
[227:31.51]If there's another missing person, scan them.
[227:32.93]That's a lot.
[227:33.39]I love Coney Dog.
[227:48.16]An AX-400 is reported to have assaulted a man last night.
[227:52.40]That could be a good starting point for our investigation.
[227:56.94]He's locked in there.
[228:09.81]Freedon Gay smiled.
[228:11.31]Direct.
[228:11.87]Aggressive.
[228:13.39]Should we stay professional?
[228:15.70]I know you didn't ask for this investigation, Lieutenant.
[228:18.95]But I'm sure you're a professional.
[228:20.41]Why don't you go fuck yourself?
[228:25.31]No.
[228:26.59]Alright, time to be firm.
[228:29.82]You know, let's lay down the firm hand of God here.
[228:34.40]I'm going to file a report with my superiors that you refuse to work on this investigation.
[228:40.20]How's that make you feel?
[228:44.64]Chris an asshole.
[228:45.88]If it was up to me, I'd throw the lot of you in a dumpster and set a match to it.
[228:49.60]So stop pissing me off.
[228:51.18]How's your dog?
[228:51.94]Things are going to get nasty.

[229:19.42]Hank got a lead.
[229:25.30]Can Hank not get a lead?
[229:26.54]That's interesting.
[229:28.86]Explore the station.
[229:30.14]We could have gone, instead of talking to Hank, we could have talked to the other android, right?
[229:36.08]Looks fairly straightforward.

[232:33.92]Why did I do that?
[232:35.06]That's my brain.
[232:36.29]Don't I die?
[232:43.44]Hold on, that's not my brain.
[232:49.71]Okay.
[232:52.41]Uh, water's not ready yet.

[233:00.30]Thank you.
[233:05.05]See?
[233:06.26]It's not about if the Twitch chat likes it.
[233:07.80]It's about if little Alice thinks it's cool.
[233:10.34]I'm trying to get... Mom points with her, guys.
[233:13.92]1028.
[233:13.98]What was that noise?

[234:03.18]I can't go in there.
[234:05.68]Now what?
[234:09.72]No androids in Canada.
[234:11.96]It's kind of an odd place to have no androids.
[234:14.02]What's this?
[234:14.56]Oh, let's change the TV.
[234:24.11]Next.
[234:26.77]Alright.

[235:17.95]Todd, can you tell us what happened?
[235:21.37]I was having dinner.

[235:24.73]A damn thing jumped on me.
[235:25.82]I managed to defend myself, but it went crazy.
[235:29.34]I thought it was going to kill me.
[235:32.36]I fought it off, but it ran away.
[235:35.20]What a lie.
[235:35.80]Thank you, Todd.
[235:37.47]Disturbing news for android owners everywhere.
[235:40.83]Police have launched a search to find the android.
[235:42.59]Should've killed Todd, huh?
[235:43.80]Let's hope they find it fast.
[235:45.44]Should've, like, shot Todd with the gun that I didn't find.
[235:47.86]He's gonna lie his way.

[242:15.50]I'm here.
[242:16.68]I'm here.
[242:16.94]What did we do with you?
[242:18.08]What did we do with you?
[242:20.32]Oh, god damn it.
[242:21.18]It's not this random guy.
[242:23.08]I thought it was the random guy standing in the road.
[242:27.88]Shit.
[242:28.34]And now I'm going to blow it because I... Don't look over here.
[242:41.73]Let's go.
[242:49.66]There is... just gonna keep going down this way.
[242:51.86]There's no police there, so I'm safe.
[242:56.50]Okay, take a video.
[242:59.62]Go back and get the secret ending.
[243:12.72]The get busted joke.
[243:13.92]No, there is no game over, don't you guys understand?
[243:16.84]We can't make jokes in this game.
[243:19.72]Because the joke will put us on a different path.
[243:22.36]I want to do the things that I'm going to try to do.
[243:24.22]Otherwise, the whole story changes.
[243:34.61]You've only ever seen that section end in a police chase.
[243:40.42]Well, let's take a look.
[243:44.28]Look at that.
[243:45.54]Look at that.
[243:48.11]See, we look at all these options here.
[243:50.39]Wow.
[243:51.23]We wow.
[243:54.09]Okay.
[243:54.65]So that could have really gone and how could that have gone so different?
[244:04.58]Let's see.
[244:07.10]Yeah.
[244:08.74]Let's take a look.
[244:09.38]Talk to Alice, draw a bath.
[244:11.94]Who didn't draw a bath for Alice?
[244:17.46]And look, brown hair is the least used.
[244:20.12]It's because it's the default one.
[244:23.35]Besides the default hair, I'm the most original.
[244:26.99]Remove the LED.
[244:28.89]Look at the painting.
[244:31.05]Look at the clock.
[244:34.45]Cheer Alice up.
[244:35.21]Here we go.
[244:36.13]Connor investigates the motel.
[244:38.85]Hank checks the motel room.
[244:42.11]Cara and Alice in the street.
[244:45.39]So only 24% have reached the train safely as these two.
[244:53.49]So you can reach the... You can be not safely.
[244:57.26]I wonder what can happen here.
[244:58.16]There's a lot more that can happen if you don't make it.
[245:02.34]Well, we did.
[245:06.60]Interesting.
[245:07.12]Alright.
[245:10.26]I wonder what happens up here.
[245:13.17]Public opinion skeptical Alice Warm.
[245:17.35]Cool.
[245:19.80]That's cool.
[245:21.06]There's a whole other thing.
[245:22.04]Several sources report that CyberLife has provided Detroit police with a prototype detective android.
[245:28.34]Although police assistive androids have been invented for several years now, this will be the first case of a
[245:34.72]back to normal as this guy I guess we contacted cyberline for comment
[245:55.41]The other two are non-motel routes.
[245:57.15]Oh, that's... Alright.
[245:59.19]So it actually does remember what the hell you did.
[246:01.03]It's not just, here's the level.
[246:03.47]Here's what you can do in this level.
[246:07.18]I like that.
[246:07.74]Check this out.
[246:14.16]Red.
[246:24.30]Look for the graffiti.
[246:26.61]It's this one.
[246:27.55]Alright, I've got to find the iPhone commercial.
[246:31.07]Let's find it.
[246:37.27]There it is.
[246:39.81]Hold on.
[246:41.06]No, no, no.
[246:41.48]Wait, wait, wait.
[246:42.08]Yes, I can.
[246:44.58]God damn it.
[246:45.70]I wanted to... Alright, found it.
[246:52.32]There it is.
[246:57.38]Analyze.
[246:59.64]Clue updated.
[247:03.15]Find this one.
[247:05.53]Okay.
[247:10.29]That one's orange.
[247:12.05]And it's fire.
[247:14.44]It's got a lion's face.
[247:17.18]You got it.
[247:17.74]Take a look.
[247:18.14]More baseball.
[247:24.60]Human only...
[247:31.64]Anybody over there?
[247:32.88]Nope.
[247:33.26]Nope.
[247:35.16]Nope.
[247:35.42]Nope.
[247:36.23]Nope.
[247:38.39]This linear section here.
[247:40.59]They have to happen, right?
[247:45.67]There it is right in front of us.
[247:46.97]There's our Renta android.
[247:59.28]Why would I think that person would know?
[248:06.89]What about this guy?
[248:11.09]Can I ask, like, the random Half-Life employee?
[248:14.39]No.
[248:16.93]Alright, there it is.
[248:18.30]Right there.
[248:18.84]Yeah.
[248:22.00]Come on.
[248:22.26]Do I have to be a certain distance away?
[248:33.95]It's right there.
[248:36.03]Do I have to be that close?
[248:42.52]Use the right stick to find the symbol.
[248:44.02]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[248:44.50]Hold on a second.
[248:46.12]Okay, that thing in the top left.
[248:50.98]Okay, I get it.
[248:52.42]I thought it just wanted me to take the picture.
[248:55.44]Find the next symbol.
[248:56.99]What is the other one?
[248:59.21]looks like a little dash and a little uh tetris game we're playing okay where's the tetris symbol where's tetris tetris no there's the next one
[249:29.65]I thought it just wanted me to take a picture of the graffiti, not like the actual symbol.
[249:32.75]I guess I could have paid attention to find the symbol, but now I know what to do.
[249:36.37]It's easy.
[249:39.83]It's the side of a building, and we're going to click on the symbol on the red stick.
[249:44.42]Alright, let's go.
[249:45.18]Do I have to wait?
[249:49.90]I think it's this building right here.
[250:01.26]There it is.
[250:02.08]Click on the symbol, sir.
[250:05.66]There it is.
[250:07.90]You did it.
[250:08.98]Where's the other one?
[250:10.52]Mmm, somewhere on the building over here.
[250:12.44]Uh, I don't know.
[250:17.87]Right there.
[250:18.43]Found it.
[250:23.03]Find the robot.
[250:25.41]The funny toy robot.
[250:26.49]Can't wait.
[250:34.38]Violated the law.
[250:37.52]How?
[250:37.82]What did I do?
[250:39.50]I didn't do anything.
[250:40.16]I have to walk around and take pictures of funny animals and stuff.
[250:48.02]It's probably on the other side.
[250:49.93]What does it look like?
[250:50.63]Authorized zone with a chain link fence.
[251:00.09]Grandus eyes.
[251:02.82]Yeah, I know.
[251:03.98]Turn around, turn around, turn around.
[251:05.56]I can do it.
[251:05.94]It's over there.
[251:11.17]Am I past it already?
[251:20.25]No.
[251:21.11]It's like on the back of this wall.
[251:22.72]Why would I have seen that?
[251:29.42]Alright, where's the other one?
[251:34.82]And the stomach right here.
[251:39.28]And right here.
[251:41.12]That's it, right?
[251:44.00]Symbol, symbol, symbol.
[251:45.35]Where's the yellow one?
[251:45.81]Where's the last one?
[251:48.79]Looks like it's on that guy.
[251:49.71]Is it on the hand or something?
[251:57.69]Looks like it's down there, but I can't... I think I have to move.
[252:03.55]That's not it right there?
[252:08.06]Oh, okay.
[252:08.60]I guess I can go in here.
[252:21.90]Move the board.
[252:22.98]Makes sense.
[252:28.40]Click.
[252:34.32]Oh, what?
[252:34.88]Nope.
[252:36.62]Got it.
[252:38.04]Don't give me another one.
[252:39.06]Oh.
[252:41.50]Alright.
[252:42.50]Okay.
[252:47.34]There we go.
[252:48.56]Okay.
[252:49.18]How many of these do I have to click on?
[252:57.61]Three of them here.
[253:01.35]One.
[253:12.51]God damn it.
[253:14.05]Don't make me have to go up there.
[253:20.69]Okay.
[253:22.63]Don't make me have to climb that.
[253:23.89]It's gonna be on the... This guy's gonna have to climb this shit, aren't I?
[253:26.94]In the nose or something?
[253:34.57]I knew it.
[253:35.01]Find a way under the roof.
[253:37.37]Can I push something?
[253:47.20]Can anything be moved around here?
[253:52.78]I can't do a super jump?
[253:53.98]How can an android not have a super jump?
[254:01.66]It's right there.
[254:02.18]I can see it.
[254:02.78]I can see it.
[254:03.18]Can I just take it?
[254:06.12]Wait, I can do this.
[254:08.94]I can move this, I guess.
[254:18.60]Back into the wall.
[254:21.55]Where's the sledgehammer?
[254:28.95]Yeah, I mean, what's the point of making a video game if there's no super jump?
[254:31.70]I understand.
[254:32.30]I agree.
[254:43.44]Am I scared to do this now?
[254:45.69]You can do it.
[254:46.57]Give me the super jump.
[254:48.83]You're not allowed to make a video game with androids and humans.
[254:52.51]Pre-construct.
[254:55.90]Use R2 to preview the route.
[255:05.19]Okay.
[255:07.21]What about on the side of the building?
[255:08.81]What about on the... Huh?
[255:16.07]Jump from here and then grab the ledge?
[255:24.38]Wall run.
[255:25.18]That's what I was going to try too.
[255:27.65]And then grab onto the plank here.
[255:29.23]Then swing.
[255:29.89]Is that going to work?
[255:33.93]Compute that.
[255:38.49]Execute.
[255:42.60]God, that would be amazing if you had that ability.
[255:45.32]You could just play out everything in your brain.
[255:47.20]And just watch it and be like... You know, if I spread to the traffic right there.
[255:50.70]And I do these exact moves.
[255:52.73]Will I miss every car?
[255:56.18]Interesting.
[255:57.30]Alright, where's this last one?
[255:59.41]Uh, Arkel.
[256:00.85]Steve Arkel.
[256:04.09]Steve Arkel.
[256:04.69]Where is that?
[256:07.03]That looks like Steve Arkel.
[256:08.13]Okay.
[256:09.21]Drop down.
[256:18.29]There it is.
[256:19.13]Take the photos.
[256:21.17]Three of these dumb symbols.
[256:26.94]There's another one here.
[256:28.35]Uh-huh.
[256:32.45]And the last one is right here.
[256:34.19]Now, let's use our imagination to do this again.
[256:49.03]Alright.
[256:51.03]Where do I need to go to?
[256:52.85]So, jump here.
[256:54.69]Up to there.
[256:56.33]And then into the wall.
[256:58.53]Oh, that's not going to work.
[257:01.39]So, what if we go from here?
[257:06.85]Back it up.
[257:08.26]So, do we need to start there?
[257:09.50]Or can we start somewhere else?
[257:13.56]I think we have to start here.
[257:16.20]Start here.
[257:18.71]Onto this.
[257:24.97]I guess not.
[257:25.87]I can't really move.
[257:26.49]You have to play the whole thing out first.
[257:40.02]Alright, let's play the whole thing.
[257:45.24]Would not be solid enough.
[257:48.35]I don't have a cursor, though.
[257:49.19]I can't move from here.
[257:58.44]I guess we can go over here.
[258:01.06]Try this way.
[258:03.96]Up and... From here... Where are you going?
[258:10.86]Either that way, or... I think that's the only way.
[258:13.17]Wall run again?
[258:13.99]Yeah, we're gonna do the wall run.
[258:19.41]Picks us up to here.
[258:23.40]And we can either jump up the wall, or... Alright, we're gonna climb on to this.
[258:33.18]Compute it!
[258:39.65]Let's do it!
[258:48.00]Yeah, I can probably safely say I think this is the... This is probably the worst storyline for me.
[258:55.87]It started off interesting.
[258:58.15]And then it got really, uh... Really linear, is the correct terminology here.
[259:04.78]Alright, looking for the broken down room with the yellow and red painting on the wall.
[259:10.22]I think it's this one.
[259:10.80]It's this wall behind me.
[259:13.18]Alright.
[259:14.52]The biggest one is the one on the wall.
[259:16.30]That's the only one.
[259:16.98]Oh, man.
[259:22.64]Alright.
[259:23.00]Now, let's go.
[259:24.07]Let's keep going.
[259:24.85]What does it look like?
[259:26.61]There's a stone.
[259:28.95]There's a scratched up stone in the wall.
[259:35.31]Marcus's story died with Carl.
[259:37.31]Alright.
[259:40.30]It's right here.
[259:41.12]It's on the other side of this.
[259:52.92]Sneak under.
[260:00.24]Turn around.
[260:02.61]It's actually right behind me.
[260:04.99]Isn't it?
[260:06.21]It's not.
[260:07.51]It's not that thing right behind me?
[260:10.35]Game, are you sure there was two planks and a funny looking stone?
[260:13.60]I guess not.
[260:32.04]There's Jericho.
[260:33.26]Clearly here.
[260:37.72]Let me make sure I didn't lose my mind.
[260:44.94]Look at that.
[260:45.31]Just look at how perfect that is, though.
[260:46.91]Take a look at the missing person's photo and look.
[260:51.31]See?
[260:51.49]I can't even do it.
[260:56.64]Reach the boat.
[260:58.50]There's a place to go up there.
[261:03.21]Uh, I'm gonna try this.
[261:14.69]Clue wasn't more symbols.
[261:18.05]Interesting.
[261:18.79]Okay.
[261:23.61]I'm about to go sleep in the car, man.
[261:26.02]Nothing over here.
[261:28.62]Why would they have this camera angle if there's nothing here?
[261:32.30]Nothing here.
[261:32.76]There's no Easter egg right there.
[261:35.24]I would highly suspect that.
[261:46.37]Up you go.
[261:50.83]Where are all these cameras?
[261:57.42]Come on.
[261:58.94]Check all options.
[262:07.20]It's gonna fall.
[262:08.06]Someone's gonna fall down and hit me in the face.
[262:10.08]Dodge something.
[262:10.64]Oh, I guess not.
[262:18.42]Uh... Oh, God.
[262:26.53]If it's me, I'm not walking this.
[262:28.31]I'm gonna run as fast as I possibly can straight ahead.
[262:37.59]Interesting scenery.
[262:38.41]Alright, jump!
[262:41.21]Uh, no, where's my calculate risk management program?
[262:46.91]I don't want to do this right now.
[262:48.31]Jump!
[262:50.13]Why wouldn't I do the risk management?
[262:51.65]Did I just kill myself?
[263:00.17]And I didn't realize that my voice just went up really high?
[263:15.10]Now what?
[263:26.88]Have I played this before, or is this the only stream?
[263:28.50]This is the first playthrough.
[263:30.68]Just blind.
[263:32.16]I've not played through any of the time.
[263:34.34]First time.
[263:37.31]We've got a flashlight, good.
[263:42.07]What am I doing with this?
[263:42.63]I'm shaking it back and forth.
[263:44.73]Okay.
[263:50.43]Is there any more to do?
[263:51.67]What is the actual mission here?
[263:54.80]Explore the boat is the mission.
[264:06.41]Yeah, don't androids have supersonic hearing?
[264:08.11]Why would they need light?
[264:15.43]Androids have permanent night vision.
[264:16.99]They don't need any of this stuff.
[264:26.18]Doors to try.
[264:28.82]Come on, open.
[264:35.71]One of these has to open.
[264:40.27]You.
[264:41.37]You're going to open, aren't you?
[264:50.15]Prison boat?
[264:50.91]What is this?
[264:54.13]Tech addict.
[264:56.06]Interesting.
[265:29.25]That it?
[265:31.06]Is that the, uh, was that the one Easter egg that I needed to find in here?
[265:37.26]I guess so.
[265:40.68]How do you hack solar panels?
[265:42.30]That's a really good question.
[265:45.06]You just, you would have to hook them up to your own house.
[265:48.35]So what that magazine was actually trying to say is this person installed solar panels in their own house.
[265:59.22]I mean, it didn't really get me that much.
[266:02.05]That was like kind of... It did like a bird scream, and that's fine.
[266:06.01]It's a little bird tricerodactyl screech.
[266:09.97]Yeah.
[266:10.99]Scary, but not really.
[266:27.61]What about this one?
[266:28.19]Open that.
[266:28.65]That one can be opened, but we're gonna look in... Can't even... Can I go this way?
[266:33.87]Open this one.
[266:35.15]This is the closest one.
[266:36.11]Just get it open.
[266:42.55]Nope.
[266:43.91]Looks like we are going in.
[266:44.95]Can I even go this way?
[266:45.79]Why am I stuck here?
[266:49.67]Okay.
[266:55.19]Facecam?
[266:55.77]What am I doing?
[266:56.55]No facecam.
[266:57.07]I'm naked.
[266:58.25]I can't.
[267:00.49]I'm not going to put clothes on.
[267:01.69]Sorry.
[267:02.05]It's not going to happen.
[267:06.67]It was really hot out today.
[267:08.33]It's really hot down here.
[267:09.35]I don't have air conditioning down here.
[267:12.59]So I have to be just naked.
[267:13.89]I have to.
[267:14.75]There's no other alternative.
[267:20.27]Nothing else here.
[267:23.11]Alright, here we go.
[267:25.85]Loud.
[267:36.94]Stand.
[267:37.52]You know what I've noticed with Marcus's storyline?
[267:46.43]You do a lot of from face down stand up.
[267:50.73]That's happened probably 15 times.
[267:56.39]Hello, neighbor.
[267:57.76]Welcome to Jericho.
[268:04.18]Please give me the choices.
[268:06.98]What were those choices?
[268:08.00]Look at them all.
[268:08.48]Look at all those choices we had.
[268:13.05]So many of them in a straight line.
[268:16.87]Hmm, let's see what people did.
[268:20.75]See, people didn't even give a shit.
[268:22.28]They just want to get done with this as fast as possible.
[268:25.27]reach the roof like you couldn't reach the roof.
[268:27.85]This is just an Easter egg.
[268:29.59]They're all just Easter eggs and you just walk forward.
[268:33.69]Here's the only choice.
[268:34.65]Instead of climbing up the crane, I could have walked over the bridge.
[268:38.66]That's it.
[268:41.54]Yeah, that was by far the worst one.
[268:45.08]I can't even see the world stats because there are none.
[268:48.52]Look at that.
[268:50.24]There are no choices here.
[268:53.27]Only back here.
[268:55.92]Picking up the book.
[268:58.54]Well, that was by far the absolute worst one of the whole game.
[269:02.12]Let's hope that's not a trend.
[269:04.68]Because it's been pretty enjoyable so far.
[269:06.36]He's tense.
[269:17.92]Again.
[269:19.45]Getting out of the car again.
[269:32.03]Yes, I will disobey your orders yet again.
[269:37.12]Let's have a heart to heart here.
[269:41.84]Detroit become friends.
[269:43.80]I like that.
[269:44.26]Come on.
[269:44.50]This is different.
[269:45.00]It's 100% guaranteed.
[269:45.64]You can't go wrong.
[269:46.20]Scan him?
[269:46.44]I'm going to get data on him.
[269:49.38]Okay.
[270:00.84]Pedro Abdar, unemployed, criminal record, illegal gambling, and fraud.
[270:10.17]No, you promised.
[270:11.01]You promised you'd never scan me.
[270:12.65]You promised you'd never scan me.
[270:14.01]Don't do it.
[270:14.47]What about this guy back here?
[270:18.39]Baseball hat guy.
[270:21.55]That's Gary Kay's business owner.
[270:24.31]Resisting arrest.
[270:25.13]Breach of hygiene regulations.
[270:27.11]Ah, so you don't want to eat here then.
[270:29.05]Alright.
[270:30.81]Hold on a second.
[270:31.70]Also really important.
[270:32.72]Let's get a zoom in here on the same hockey game that is being played.
[270:40.22]Detroit Food Hygiene License C. Yeah.
[270:43.60]Really like this hockey game.
[270:47.33]Well, I have some info now.
[270:50.80]Good to know.
[270:52.22]Alright, I'm in.
[270:53.56]Damn straight.
[270:56.76]Hey, you won't regret this.
[270:59.78]I should buy him a hot dog.
[271:02.22]Please, allow me.
[271:03.06]Would you like a hot dog?
[271:05.48]I hear they're quite good.
[271:06.34]What is your problem?
[271:08.56]What you ever do as you're told?
[271:11.01]Look, you don't have to follow me around like a poodle.
[271:19.35]Reconcile.
[271:19.91]Apologize.
[271:21.97]Let's... Let's apologize.
[271:26.59]I'm sorry for my behavior back at the police station.
[271:30.27]I didn't mean to be unpleasant.
[271:32.09]Oh, wow.
[271:33.01]He hates me.
[271:33.59]If you think out of Brown knows an apology program.
[271:36.09]Yeah, he does.
[271:36.83]Yeah, he does.
[271:37.69]Guys, it's cyber life on everything, huh?
[271:44.95]Don't eat that.
[271:45.61]Don't eat that.
[271:46.25]Don't eat that.
[271:46.85]Ah, thanks, Gary.
[271:48.48]I'm sorry.
[271:51.10]What's in the way?
[271:51.64]I can't see.
[271:52.22]The food?
[271:53.74]Oh, I can scan the food.
[271:54.94]Can I tell if it's got, like, diarrhea in it?
[271:58.88]I couldn't do it.
[272:02.14]Wait, don't eat it.
[272:05.94]How do I tell him to don't eat it?
[272:08.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[272:09.04]Don't eat that hamburger.
[272:10.14]Hold on.
[272:10.42]Let me look at it first.
[272:12.45]Wait.
[272:12.89]Ah, shit.
[272:13.39]No, don't do it.
[272:15.23]No, don't eat it.
[272:18.25]Why?
[272:18.81]It's over.
[272:20.94]Enjoy your meal.
[272:22.96]Thank you.
[272:29.04]I don't want to alarm you, Lieutenant, but I think your friends are engaged in illegal activities.
[272:35.31]Well, everybody does what they have to to get by.
[272:37.25]As long as they're not hurting anybody, I don't bother.
[272:40.89]Enjoy your meal.
[272:43.33]Okay.
[272:45.80]I can't even tell him about that.
[272:48.87]Uh, let's talk about, let's talk about me.
[272:50.13]He wasn't very nice.
[272:51.17]Hmm, Hank and, I don't, okay, I could have told them about the burger.
[273:18.19]Can I ask you a personal question?
[273:22.27]Why do you hate androids so much?
[273:23.63]I have my reasons.
[273:30.34]Maybe I should tell you what we know about deviants.
[273:33.20]You read my mind.
[273:35.68]Proceed.
[273:37.02]We believe that a mutation occurs in the software of some androids, which can lead to them emulating a human emotion.
[273:43.57]English, please.
[273:45.85]They don't really feel emotions.
[273:48.22]They just get overwhelmed by irrational instructions, which can lead to unpredictable behavior.
[273:53.98]That's the best looking computer generated hamburger I've ever seen.
[273:57.02]Emotions always screw everything up.
[273:59.90]The androids aren't as different from us as we thought.
[274:02.16]I've seen plenty of cartoon, CG, video game, movie hamburgers.
[274:06.94]That's the best one I've ever seen.
[274:11.94]A few months back,
[274:14.10]A deviant was threatening to jump off the roof with a little girl.
[274:18.18]I managed to save her.
[274:22.01]So I guess you've done all your homework, right?
[274:24.89]Got everything there is to know about me.
[274:31.31]I know you graduated top of your class.
[274:33.12]I can see right through this guy.
[274:34.88]You made a name for yourself in several cases and became the youngest lieutenant in Detroit.
[274:40.43]I also know you've received several disciplinary warnings in recent years, and... I'm too direct with Hank.
[274:48.05]I gotta be... I gotta ease up.
[274:52.75]Sincere psychological cold.
[274:55.64]Sincere.
[274:56.64]I think working with an officer with... personal issues is an added challenge.
[275:02.86]But adapting to human unpredictability is one of my features.
[275:08.57]He liked that, apparently.
[275:10.37]I just got a report of a suspected deviant.
[275:13.33]It's a few blocks away.
[275:15.21]That was just off-handed, passive-aggressive insult.
[275:19.42]I'll let you finish your meal.
[275:21.58]I'll be in the car if you need me.
[275:33.43]Added challenge.
[275:34.91]Hey, Connor.
[275:36.99]You run out of batteries or what?
[275:38.93]I'm sorry.
[275:40.01]I was making a report to CyberLife.
[275:42.49]What does that mean?
[275:45.55]Well, do you plan on staying in the elevator?
[275:48.05]No.
[275:49.11]I'm coming.
[275:53.55]Question the suspect.
[275:55.83]What do we know about this guy?
[275:56.99]I love it.
[275:58.04]Not much.
[275:59.54]Just that a neighbor reported that he heard strange noises coming from this floor.
[276:03.90]Nobody's supposed to be living here.
[276:05.56]But the neighbor said he saw a man hiding an LED under his couch.
[276:09.09]What's this?
[276:10.85]Bird feathers.
[276:13.37]Columbia Livia.
[276:14.51]Rock pick.
[276:14.99]We have to investigate every time somebody hears a strange noise.
[276:17.81]We're going to need more cops.
[276:19.33]Alright.
[276:19.65]Bust the door down.
[276:20.57]Screaming.
[276:21.57]Hey, were you really making a report back there in the elevator?
[276:24.93]Yeah.
[276:25.23]Correct.
[276:28.49]I was going over my conversation I had with you and how much I like you.
[276:32.39]If you want to know.
[276:33.23]Oh.
[276:33.51]That was a little too human for our friend Connor here, though.
[276:57.57]Should I scan?
[276:59.81]Question the suspect.
[277:01.31]We don't... That's all we got for, uh... An objective here.
[277:09.93]Alright.
[277:10.62]You going in this one?
[277:16.10]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[277:19.22]Who's that?
[277:19.52]Who's that?
[277:20.10]Oh, that's him.
[277:21.50]What's going on with all these birds?
[277:24.83]Why are there 500,000 birds in here?
[277:27.41]I thought that guy came... I thought that he had a gun from the other side.
[277:35.90]No, he's not.
[277:36.38]Let's investigate the apartment.
[277:37.50]I'm already in here.
[277:38.08]Let's check in here.
[277:40.81]Looks like... Nothing of interest.
[277:43.35]Well, there's blood here.
[277:44.11]It's that weird... Confirm that he's a deviant.
[277:49.69]Find cause of loud noise.
[277:54.44]What's over here?
[277:57.60]They wrote all the birds first.
[277:58.78]What's that say?
[278:03.71]Oh, they're doing R9K again.
[278:04.91]Any idea what it means?
[278:11.29]RA9.
[278:14.63]Written 2471 times.
[278:15.83]Impressive, we can actually see that.
[278:18.69]It's the same sign Ortiz's android wrote on the shower wall.
[278:23.37]Why are they obsessed with this sign?
[278:28.57]Looks like mazes or something.
[278:30.60]RKO out of nowhere.
[278:32.08]Watch out.
[278:35.78]Obsessive-compulsive writing.
[278:39.28]Yeah, we gotta pick up some data here, because... When you question them... That's how you get them.
[278:49.50]Wooden stool recently disturbed.
[278:50.68]Traces of avian fecal matter.
[278:52.08]Gross.
[278:54.53]And... something else.
[278:56.89]Cigarette button.
[278:59.40]Opened marker pen.
[279:00.56]Still wet.
[279:01.14]Used recently.
[279:02.04]Midnight mood black.
[279:06.60]Reconstructed.
[279:07.26]Let's see what happened.
[279:11.10]All the way back here.
[279:12.32]Table flipped over.
[279:14.34]Grenade came in.
[279:16.33]Suspect was here recently writing.
[279:20.27]Standing on the stool.
[279:21.39]The stool must have fallen off.
[279:22.61]He fell.
[279:23.01]He tripped.
[279:23.43]Yep.
[279:23.71]Because he's a clumsy fucking idiot.
[279:26.53]Somebody called him to dinner.
[279:29.01]Smashes his face on the sink.
[279:35.92]Ran to the living room.
[279:39.08]Where he... Ran into our suspect.
[279:45.27]He's saying, look what?
[279:48.81]Look.
[279:49.35]Uh, sample.
[279:52.82]Let's eat it.
[279:54.66]I thought I promised never to eat things at the crime scene again.
[279:58.90]Blue blood reported missing.
[280:00.00]Oh, wait, wait a minute.
[280:05.55]This is, um... Wait, what?
[280:09.21]Biocomponent deactivated.
[280:11.27]It's LED is in the sink.
[280:12.59]It is a deviant.
[280:14.01]Not surprised it was an android.
[280:15.99]No human could live with all these fucking pigeons.
[280:19.53]Confused.
[280:20.04]Didn't she take the... This is a different scenario, I think.
[280:24.74]Alright, that's fine.
[280:26.12]What is that, though?
[280:26.82]That looks strange.
[280:31.92]UFO.
[280:35.68]What in the name of God are they all doing in here?
[280:42.69]You could make a business in here.
[280:44.61]Of selling pigeons.
[280:46.47]And pigeon eggs.
[280:48.53]Don't even disturb it.
[280:49.33]Just close the door.
[280:51.19]Bring in some food.
[280:52.33]Take them out the window.
[280:54.64]Take the eggs out the window.
[280:55.80]You could probably make 20 grand.
[280:57.10]Alright, what do we got?
[281:00.60]Analyze.
[281:04.10]Urban Farms of Detroit.
[281:05.62]Anything else?
[281:21.57]I don't see anything else.
[281:27.21]Ah, somebody tore the corner.
[281:29.91]Post a corner and 100% recycled paper recently moved.
[281:33.03]So, move it.
[281:36.56]There's gonna be a whole other house back here.
[281:44.98]We got books on tape?
[281:49.56]Markings all over it.
[281:51.49]Electronic books, see?
[281:52.37]Yeah.
[281:52.51]Got more stuff to look at here.
[281:56.03]Find cause of loud noise.
[281:57.47]Look at the stuff over here.
[282:15.44]Can't pick up the lunchbox?
[282:22.67]Oh, he really was running a bird business.
[282:23.81]Big sniff.
[282:24.11]He doesn't eat.
[282:25.65]But why?
[282:44.03]There's more... A couple more things.
[282:45.75]A couple more things on the ground.
[282:46.85]I'm gonna check over here.
[282:51.82]I'm not... I don't hate birds, but I would be in a panic in this room.
[282:57.00]Birds are unpredictable.
[282:58.94]The flapping sounds, just the sheer volume of them.
[283:03.21]I would be in a panic in here.
[283:04.19]I wouldn't want to move.
[283:07.81]These pigeons are like cockroaches, you know what I mean?
[283:09.35]If you step in the room and turn the light on, they just...
[283:14.02]Honestly, if you... One false move in this room... And there would be a bird explosion in this room.
[283:20.90]And it would take you out.
[283:22.39]Just... All the bird, pigeon shrapnel that would fly everywhere... Just at their wings... You would make an explosion in here.
[283:29.27]And you would not survive.
[283:31.53]You would have to tiptoe through this room as if they were all landmines.
[283:34.17]Because what this game is not showing you is if one of them does this... The whole room turns into a tornado.
[283:50.09]I got some scratch marks here.
[283:51.01]What was that?
[283:53.99]What was that?
[283:55.37]Skid mark.
[283:57.32]Galvanized steel.
[283:59.76]Fingerprints.
[284:02.04]Of a avian fecal matter.
[284:04.60]One of the birds grabbed this and flipped it over.
[284:06.98]Apparently... Metal hook.
[284:12.86]Recently broken.
[284:18.53]This is the cage.
[284:20.81]What was hanging in here?
[284:25.13]Alright, I think I know what happened here.
[284:28.35]Yep, I can piece this together without any more evidence.
[284:30.71]So a guy was in there painting R9K on the wall, and he was just trying to make, like, fucking Twitch chat jokes.
[284:36.24]All of a sudden, one of his birds freaks out.
[284:39.50]Does a bird explosion in the whole room.
[284:41.02]Pigeon shrapnel everywhere.
[284:42.12]Guy's sprinting around, knocking stuff over, falling down.
[284:44.38]He gets, like, stabbed.
[284:46.64]What we're seeing is exactly what I just described to you.
[284:51.41]He's trying to get out of the bird room.
[284:53.59]Because he stepped on a fucking pigeon landmine.
[284:55.35]That's exactly what happened.
[284:56.35]There's something else here I'm missing, though.
[285:03.29]Yep, see?
[285:03.83]He got, like, smashed.
[285:05.11]One of the birds flew in his face.
[285:10.12]He tried to escape through the chair.
[285:14.02]And he got into the attic.
[285:15.38]Okay, another attic.
[285:22.03]They're everywhere.
[285:22.53]They're like bees.
[285:28.26]Expose suspect.
[285:30.18]Let me check this one last thing, though.
[285:35.46]Because there could be more.
[285:37.64]Get out of there.
[285:38.70]Suspect cares for wild animals.
[285:40.24]I'm glad I got that.
[285:45.78]Let's go.
[285:47.14]Now I can confront him about the birds.
[285:58.25]So what are you doing?
[286:01.95]Oh, another attic addict.
[286:04.76]I like that.
[286:06.80]So we need to go up there.
[286:09.21]Expose it.
[286:09.75]Well, we need to go up the stairs.
[286:14.49]Military jacket.
[286:16.35]90% caught.
[286:19.86]Alright, well, where did he go?
[286:22.74]We need to run up to...
[286:36.94]Here we go.
[286:37.18]Fucking pigeons!
[286:37.88]What are you waiting for?
[286:39.78]Chase it!
[286:41.02]Watch out for the pigeons, they're everywhere!
[286:45.56]Nice.
[286:47.15]Here comes the quick times.
[286:50.59]Oh no, he's throwing bird grenades!
[286:52.95]Go!
[286:59.36]There we go, that's what I'm talking about.
[287:00.68]Action.
[287:00.84]Scan.
[287:01.86]Easy but slow.
[287:02.56]Fast but risky.
[287:04.88]Risky.
[287:05.80]Fast.
[287:10.05]Balanced.
[287:10.61]Safer detour.
[287:11.43]Fast but risky.
[287:18.53]Ooh!
[287:18.95]That was pretty risky.
[287:21.68]Okay.
[287:22.60]Direct but risky.
[287:23.84]Safe but crowded.
[287:25.42]Direct.
[287:25.86]Look out!
[287:29.66]Excuse me.
[287:31.24]Excuse me.
[287:32.54]Pardon me.
[287:35.34]What's next?
[287:42.03]What did he... I don't know where... Where did he go?
[287:44.13]Oh, he's over here.
[287:44.91]There's a bunch of servers in here.
[287:46.09]Sorry.
[287:46.69]I blew it.
[287:48.65]Did I?
[287:52.71]Come on, give me another brisky.
[287:55.21]Come on, brisky.
[287:58.19]Direct but slow.
[287:58.91]Fast but brisky.
[288:00.15]Brisky.
[288:04.37]Right up here.
[288:08.89]Up.
[288:09.91]And over.
[288:12.91]It's right there.
[288:14.15]Come on, frog splash him.
[288:17.21]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it!
[288:22.95]Get him!
[288:25.19]Remember the super jump I was talking about?
[288:26.77]Why does this guy... Connor has all these moves.
[288:37.73]Be careful, asshole.
[288:41.55]So Connor is the real T-1000.
[288:45.98]Marcus couldn't do anything.
[288:49.72]Alright, we got safe and slow directly from him.
[288:52.06]That was in the weed farm.
[288:57.59]What is it, when they grow cabbages in here?
[289:03.83]Get out of the fucking way.
[289:09.58]Where am I going?
[289:10.38]I'm in like a cornfield.
[289:15.70]There he is.
[289:17.22]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[289:20.22]Oh, okay.
[289:20.60]No, no, no.
[289:21.40]Chance of survival.
[289:22.12]89%.
[289:22.24]He's gonna, he's fine.
[289:23.78]He's got an 89% chance.
[289:24.46]He's gonna throw himself out and fall backwards.
[289:40.96]I've done nothing wrong.
[289:42.01]89%, guys.
[289:42.83]He's fine.
[289:43.13]I just want it to be free.
[289:44.23]You know what they'll do to me if you turn me in.
[289:49.87]Model 874004961.
[289:51.63]Serious malfunctions have been detected in your software, including class 4 errors.
[289:58.66]89%?
[289:59.38]He's fine.
[290:01.94]And will be sent back to CyberLife for deactivation.
[290:06.15]Look it.
[290:06.45]He survived.
[290:07.19]Don't you fucking move.
[290:10.46]He's... You bastard!
[290:13.20]You saw I was gonna fall and you'd rather let me die than fail your fucking mission!
[290:16.68]I had to make a choice.
[290:18.22]It seemed to me... What am I to you?
[290:19.56]A statistic?
[290:21.16]He's alive.
[290:21.78]A zero?
[290:22.24]A one in your fucking program?
[290:24.04]Huh?
[290:25.62]Is that how you see humans, you bastard?
[290:28.34]Jesus.
[290:29.12]I understand you're upset.
[290:30.64]Perhaps I didn't assess the situation... Fuck you and your fucking assessment!
[290:34.49]Well, you see, it said 89% next to your name.
[290:37.07]If it was any lower than a straight up B-, I would have tried to save you.
[290:41.95]If that was 75%, I would have tried to get him.
[290:45.83]I would have saved him.
[290:47.11]Seriously.
[291:03.91]That didn't matter anyways.
[291:12.35]Look at that choice.
[291:16.81]Oh, no.
[291:17.39]He did the other thing he wasn't supposed to do.
[291:19.25]What are we going to do to fix this?
[291:21.19]I know.
[291:21.97]Just have him wrench away from the two guys and jump off the building anyways.
[291:25.66]Okay.
[291:30.06]So... Uh... Right.
[291:36.21]Talk to Hank.
[291:37.47]Be Frank with Hank.
[291:39.47]Warn Hank about his friends.
[291:42.71]Okay, we got examine the feathers.
[291:46.06]In the apartment, everybody does the same thing.
[291:47.74]Find the diary.
[291:48.58]Investigate the stool.
[291:51.92]Who's the one person?
[291:55.08]You know what I'm saying?
[291:56.00]Okay, so how is this possible?
[291:57.95]Right?
[291:59.09]Find... Find... Okay, find Rupert, right?
[292:08.22]Does the 1% of people get to the stage and turn off their console?
[292:16.85]How is it 1%?
[292:19.69]Like those of us that got to chase Rupert, gaining on Rupert.
[292:25.21]Rupert pushes Hank.
[292:26.40]Follow Rupert.
[292:27.90]Rupert, see, I did the thing that nobody does.
[292:37.79]No, this is friend stats.
[292:40.53]This is the world stats.
[292:45.77]There's another option below it.
[292:46.87]Yeah, I know, but... Like, this stuff back here, though.
[292:55.91]Some people just didn't... Like, one person out of a hundred people just decided not to do this stuff here.
[293:02.09]Wait, what?
[293:09.70]Reverse, reverse.
[293:11.06]No, there's no rewinding.
[293:13.26]I made my decision.
[293:14.16]If it was any lower than 89%, I would have put my hand out and grabbed him.
[293:18.56]That's all there is to it.
[293:25.22]You can't be sure with a 75%, or even an 80%.
[293:26.34]Like 11%, 12%.
[293:26.52]I'll take those odds.
[293:27.04]North.
[293:43.97]This is Jericho?
[293:44.97]What is Jericho?
[293:45.61]It's a refuge for those who don't want to be slaves anymore.
[293:54.13]Free?
[293:54.57]And hiding just to stay alive.
[293:56.43]That's freedom to you?
[293:57.75]Humans hate us.
[293:59.73]Hiding is the only way we can survive.
[294:01.71]There is no safe place for those like us.
[294:04.92]If humans knew we were here, they'd kill us.
[294:06.82]One of the ten chance to die is pretty messed up.
[294:09.44]I mean, you're looking at it the wrong way.
[294:13.14]Nine out of ten times.
[294:14.80]I don't understand.
[294:15.58]I thought Jericho was a place where androids lived in freedom.
[294:18.50]We do live in freedom.
[294:20.84]It may not be what you hoped for, but here we have no master.
[294:24.38]We don't belong to anybody.
[294:27.68]I understand how you feel.
[294:29.44]But we have more freedom here than you ever did.
[294:34.25]uh now you guys I came to jericho looking for hope looks like I'm not gonna find any here you're lost just like the rest of us we didn't ask for this all we can do now is deal with the same way of looking at you're safe here you can stay with us as long as you want god
[295:02.54]Murphy's Law, the worst outcome is always the one that'll happen.
[295:05.33]Yeah, but Murphy... Look, Murphy, like, bumped his head.
[295:13.71]On his bunk bed when he was 12 years old.
[295:15.55]And all of a sudden, he came up with this thing.
[295:17.19]Like, everything's gonna... Man, it's gonna happen to me, Will!
[295:22.66]Yeah, you don't... The thing that I don't tell you about Murphy's Law is... Jake Murphy won the lottery when he was 31.
[295:27.96]So... Where do you think he got the money to do that research?
[295:36.04]Makes you think.
[295:37.42]So unlucky.
[295:38.06]Are we just talking to people now?
[295:49.21]Oh my god.
[295:51.47]You don't look like in good shape.
[295:57.02]Where's the option where I say worms eat you?
[296:01.96]Because that's really mean.
[296:03.42]No, I don't.
[296:08.10]Worms eat you.
[296:30.20]Mmmmmmmmmmmmm.
[296:42.13]Why didn't they put that in?
[296:42.99]That would have been better.
[296:43.61]Oh, okay.
[296:52.40]She's dead.
[296:52.90]She died.
[296:56.49]Windows 10 update.
[296:57.55]These people are freaking me out.
[297:01.52]Alright, I don't like, these people, I don't like, these people are freaking me out.
[297:04.82]I'm going to go up those stairs and kick the barrel of gas down the stairs and shoot it with a shotgun and run.
[297:09.88]They're all, look at these people.
[297:12.76]You tell me they did the rise up.
[297:15.28]Wait, what?
[297:18.75]Oh, what?
[297:28.01]Okay, alright.
[297:34.95]How long have I been streaming for?
[297:36.19]Five hours?
[297:36.77]I think I'm gonna take a break.
[297:42.70]I think it's time for a break.
[297:51.18]Yeah, I think I'm done for tonight.
[297:56.69]We'll do, after the bits and all the credits and everything, it'll be probably about six hours, so.
[298:03.35]So, here's what we're doing.
[298:05.11]Because I don't want to break up the flow of this game, we're going to do this tomorrow night.
[298:10.60]It's off schedule, but we're going to play this tomorrow night.
[298:16.54]Doing this again, we're going to do it tomorrow, just off schedule, we're going to finish it.
[298:20.00]Because I think there is another, what, like four or five maybe hours left in the game?
[298:29.98]Something like that.
[298:30.54]So... Split it up into two days.
[298:33.00]Five or six hours each day.
[298:36.93]So... I'll see you tomorrow.
[298:38.67]Same time.
[298:39.13]Probably starting around like... Four or five o'clock.
[298:42.39]Eastern.
[298:46.25]And then of course... Stay tuned for the Sunday.
[298:50.73]Sunday at 4.30 is the Polygraph stream.
[298:54.31]There's a lot to do this week.
[298:55.50]So...
[298:57.56]I will bid you all adieu.
[298:59.24]Thanks for coming out.
[299:00.02]Thanks for hanging out.
[299:01.78]If you join us tomorrow, we're going to literally start exactly where we left off here.
[299:09.17]And with that, let's do the credits.

[301:54.99]Thank you for your subscriptions for tonight.
[302:05.56]I'm always at the very top of the screen and it gets, it really does stress me the fuck out.
[302:16.29]Do you have the sub names on another list that isn't scrolling?
[302:20.72]No.
[302:22.10]That's just the way it is.
[302:26.34]But thanks a lot, guys.
[302:27.06]Now we're going to move on to the bits.
[302:33.87]See you tomorrow if you're new to the stream.
[302:37.25]We typically... I don't read subs and bits and donations on stream.
[302:43.32]I do them after the fact.
[302:44.32]We kind of hang out for like an hour and just chill and talk and find it to be more... more my cup of tea than doing it on stream.
[303:01.14]But if you take it off, much love to you.
[303:03.60]See you tomorrow.
[303:04.38]Maybe.
[303:05.91]An hour, yeah.
[303:06.49]Sometimes it goes for like four hours, but it happens, right?
[303:14.61]Fit all the names onto a spreadsheet.
[303:20.00]But, hey.
[303:21.48]An hour.
[303:22.78]Alright, I am going to shoot for... The stream's been going for five hours, right?
[303:27.80]At six hours, the stream is turning off.
[303:33.96]So...
[303:36.47]That, like, we're going to do one hour here.
[303:42.21]I know I'm going to get, like, halfway through the list and that's a lie, but at least I've pretended.
[303:47.75]At least I've pretended.
[303:49.37]Pretend and tried in the same word.
[303:50.63]I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
[303:52.21]Anywho.
[303:53.03]Thank you to Vaping Guinea Pigs for the $1.
[303:57.15]Serious Sloth.
[303:59.03]Thanks a lot, dude.
[304:01.20]Stix, Renegade, thanks for the $1.
[304:02.62]Knowing you, you're gonna get everyone killed.
[304:04.08]Be careful, there's no game overs.
[304:05.50]If you fuck up, that's it.
[304:09.12]Um... Everybody's still alive.
[304:12.10]Except for the old guy in the beginning.
[304:15.90]Everyone's doing just fine.
[304:18.82]Mostly lost, thanks for the $1.
[304:20.10]What the fuck?
[304:20.57]Why are you playing a game that came out last decade?
[304:25.03]Oh, the title.
[304:27.11]Too Human, I forgot.
[304:28.95]I may have confused a bunch of people, but oh well.
[304:32.04]Smellyboy11, thanks for the $1.
[304:33.62]Tell us some bullying stories from when you were in school.
[304:38.18]Um... I... No.
[304:44.14]No, I mean... That's... I don't want to do that.
[304:51.13]I don't want to talk about being bullied in school.
[304:55.99]I wasn't really.
[304:56.75]That didn't really happen.
[305:01.07]But, I mean, there were a couple of cases where there was a couple of religious, like, kind of dicks that did really annoying, awful, mean things to me.
[305:09.80]But, I mean, not enough to, like, share, I don't think.
[305:17.74]Tell us about the people that you bullied.
[305:19.72]No, I was the person that, when I was in high school and beyond, right, I was just, like, the wild card.
[305:28.44]I was the joker.
[305:32.00]Nobody hated me in high school.
[305:35.46]I could fit in with a lot of different crowds.
[305:37.91]But nobody really liked me either.
[305:42.63]I'm just kidding.
[305:43.45]I'm kidding.
[305:44.75]I'm kidding.
[305:47.67]Yeah, I was like the wild card, man.
[305:49.22]I was like the joker, man.
[305:50.82]I was like the... If I was like a card, I would definitely be the joker.
[305:54.48]You know why?
[305:55.50]Man, it's because I'm so different and crazy and everybody discards me from every single game they play.
[306:06.47]There.
[306:06.77]There you go.
[306:13.43]So...
[306:25.33]Because, no, the Joker is a good card.
[306:28.93]It can be any card, but again, it's never used in any game.
[306:31.43]You throw it in the trash.
[306:40.76]But, anyways, let's move on.
[306:42.40]Thank you for the, uh, Mandala Smelly Boy.
[306:45.84]I don't really, there's no, I don't really have any bully stories.
[306:51.82]I was just kind of a guy in high school and had some friends and whatever.
[306:55.68]That's it.
[306:58.42]Hey, Min26, thanks for the $1.
[306:59.78]Hey, Jerma, I love you.
[307:01.16]Say hello to Koala Purge and Major Sweep for me.
[307:04.90]Hey, hi, those two.
[307:06.74]How are you?
[307:13.64]I only got 45 minutes left?
[307:14.91]No, I got 53 minutes left.
[307:18.96]I got my OBS meter running here.
[307:20.44]It's, I got five hours and seven minutes right now.
[307:22.86]We're good.
[307:25.72]Uh, holy mackerel the third, thanks for the two dollars.
[307:27.88]I'll give you two bucks for that baby.
[307:32.45]What baby?
[307:35.17]Uh, I don't know what you're talking about, but thanks for the two dollars, Mac.
[307:38.91]Appreciate it.
[307:40.75]Thank you, Tel Naga, for the one dollar and forty-five cents.
[307:44.91]Hey, Jerma, a while ago I donated and talked about how I might get kicked out because of my health.
[307:49.61]I'm sorry to say I was right.
[307:53.01]That's unfortunate.
[307:56.71]I'm really sorry to hear that, man.
[307:59.49]Uh... Some people in the chat were asking for a GoFundMe.
[308:03.26]So I made one.
[308:06.96]Uh... I'm really sorry to hear that, man.
[308:10.36]That's not cool.
[308:15.09]I think, uh...
[308:17.07]So you actually, that happened.
[308:18.87]So where are you now?
[308:22.27]Hopefully in a safe place.
[308:27.67]Somebody just linked it there.
[308:30.55]I'm really sorry to hear that, man.
[308:33.47]If you hang out in the Discord a little bit, I'm sure people can give you advice.
[308:40.52]Unfortunately, I don't really have much advice for you.
[308:46.16]Because I've never encountered a situation like that, ever.
[308:51.36]So I would much rather refer you to somebody that would be able to actually give you some real good advice here.
[309:04.34]and that would probably be I would say probably I'm trying to think like some maybe somebody in the chat could help out with this then nobody deserves to be in that situation but I I really don't want to be like hey here's what you need to do because I don't really know that information
[309:26.57]I'm not sure if there are local establishments that can help you get you on your feet.
[309:32.63]Or maybe some local recruiting offices you can go into and talk to them.
[309:41.74]Just for the sake of trying to figure out what your next step is.
[309:47.38]But I'm really sorry to hear that tell.
[309:55.85]The link is... Somebody just linked it.
[310:00.67]It's right there in the chat right now.
[310:05.62]That's fucking horrible.
[310:14.65]I really do hope you have somebody that can help take care of you.
[310:17.55]At least temporarily.
[310:29.28]Because that is not a good situation at all.
[310:37.51]Take care of yourself.
[310:44.03]Please keep us up to date on how you're doing.
[310:56.08]And again, if anybody in the chat or in the Discord can give him some more resources.
[311:10.14]That I am just not equipped for, right?
[311:17.45]Places to go.
[311:18.11]I'm not sure where you're located.
[311:20.23]But maybe if somebody's in the... I guess knows that area might be able to help you out there.
[311:30.13]We actually wish you the best of luck.
[311:34.29]Goddamn.
[311:37.65]But moving on from that, they have people to live with.
[311:42.49]That's good to hear.
[311:48.09]Never a good situation, but...
[311:51.64]Tell, I really do hope, I want to, like, make this really clear to you, if you're watching.
[311:57.28]Do not, um, you don't have to give me any money.
[312:02.15]Like, you don't have to give, don't give me any more money.
[312:04.75]Like, I really hope you don't.
[312:07.03]Please understand that I sincerely appreciate it.
[312:15.47]any money that you've given me.
[312:17.89]But you need to really start taking care of yourself here.
[312:21.17]Take care of you first.
[312:22.72]Don't worry about giving bits or... Seriously.
[312:29.76]I hope you understand why I'm saying that, right?
[312:36.25]Much love to you though, man.
[312:43.03]But anyways...
[312:44.91]Moving on to the next set of bits here.
[312:49.25]Smellyboy11, thanks for the $1.
[312:50.73]Hold on.
[312:54.89]My dad has had experience with this sort of thing.
[312:56.63]If you need advice, I'm LordTacoTheGreat on the Discord server.
[313:03.45]Look at this.
[313:03.79]Look at this.
[313:04.11]This is what I like.
[313:05.35]This is what I like.
[313:06.85]That's what I like to see.
[313:08.79]Good shit, guys.
[313:13.07]Smelly Boy, though, says the title for the video will be Detroit Every Second Counts.
[313:18.23]Probably.
[313:22.47]Casey, thanks for the $1.
[313:23.77]Hope you, Kim, and your animal friends are doing well.
[313:26.37]Thank you.
[313:28.81]Thank you, Casey.
[313:32.98]KXZ501, thanks for the thousand bits.
[313:35.96]1-0-0-0.
[313:36.18]Thanks a lot.
[313:39.83]Yes, do it.
[313:40.49]Unlock all the timelines.
[313:41.81]I don't know if I'm going to have time to do that.
[313:48.27]Thank you, KXE, though.
[313:51.84]Bake me home thanks for the $2.30.
[313:55.74]My last bits of the month till July.
[313:58.02]This is all I can spend on food.
[313:59.78]How do you survive?
[314:02.96]How do I survive?
[314:06.57]A couple of sticks.
[314:09.19]Two napkins.
[314:12.22]One large bottle of bone broth.
[314:16.94]A sword.
[314:17.40]A lighter.
[314:21.82]And a handful of Tic Tacs.
[314:25.30]I'm good.
[314:30.47]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the one dollar.
[314:34.80]Well, somebody said something funny in the chat.
[314:48.10]I can't laugh at a joke at a movie theater.
[314:50.96]I've been sitting there during some really, really heavy moments in a game or in a movie, and one of my friends leans in and whispers something funny, and I'm just like...
[315:01.62]Sure, did I ruin the scene?
[315:03.15]Sure I did.
[315:03.99]I'm not going home.
[315:05.29]The attendant comes over.
[315:07.39]Excuse me, guys.
[315:09.15]I am doing the default Simpsons guy that's in every one of the movie attendant scenes.
[315:15.18]If you could do me a favor and just get the fuck out of here.
[315:17.90]I'm watching a movie, buddy.
[315:26.38]And they leave, and they're like, high five.
[315:28.68]I got butter all over my hands.
[315:30.66]Covered all over my hands from the buttered popcorn.
[315:33.04]High five, splash, butter goes all over like a bunch of people.
[315:39.72]And they're like, what the hell was that?
[315:41.27]Excuse me, I'm trying to enjoy the movie, buddy.
[315:46.79]You ever notice that when you call somebody buddy or like friend or like, hey, buddy.
[315:55.81]Why is that so combative?
[315:59.40]It's like, you're calling me your friend, but I'm not your friend because I don't really know you and you're calling me your friend in a mean way.
[316:09.44]Why is that so... I don't know why that's... It is, though.
[316:13.29]If I got cut off in traffic and somebody leaned out and was like, hey, it's my lane, buddy.
[316:18.61]It's like, what the fuck did you just say?
[316:26.74]He's essentially calling me his friend.
[316:28.58]Why would that anger someone?
[316:35.66]Thank you, peel, peel, peeling for the $5.
[316:39.76]Shamrock, Shamrock, Shamrock, come live here in Vegas, Jerm.
[316:43.64]See all the obnoxiously large screens you want.
[316:46.90]It's gonna be great, can't wait.
[316:50.50]Thank you, Sir Feline.
[316:52.97]For the $100 here.
[316:53.87]No!
[316:54.51]100 bits.
[316:55.81]That's not what it was.
[316:57.05]Thanks for the $1, dude.
[316:59.76]Ha ha ha.
[317:00.42]It's so funny.
[317:02.56]I can't afford food anymore.
[317:06.80]Why are you doing, like, capital ha ha ha's?
[317:08.84]Why are you doing this?
[317:11.72]Why are you doing that?
[317:13.57]Capital ha ha ha's.
[317:16.49]That's scream laughing.
[317:20.12]When I see somebody do this, that means that they are laughing so hard that they are audibly yelling very loudly.
[317:29.99]Thank you, Holy Mac, for the $1.
[317:31.71]It's because we have to sympathize with the characters, and despite being an allegory for racism, Cage seems to think we need the character to look like us to understand them.
[317:42.96]Capital 100.
[317:43.28]I mean...
[317:48.21]David cage always likes to step around you know he's talking about the everybody has to you know you can't have like c-3po's they have to be people I'm telling you think of how much this tone of this game would be different
[318:16.31]If they all looked like the Silver Surfer.
[318:23.42]Polo Juice, thanks for the $100 earlier.
[318:25.18]You gave a lot of money.
[318:26.64]A lot today.
[318:28.74]Thank you.
[318:29.58]$100 for the most exciting gameplay on Twitch.
[318:31.29]Appreciate that, man.
[318:33.37]Doobie Doo, thanks for the $10.
[318:34.49]Hey, Jerma.
[318:36.17]Been watching you for many years now, ever since Destiny brought me to your YouTube channel.
[318:44.92]Wait, the YouTube...
[318:47.20]the game did I did I play destiny when did I play that well wait that's a that's a person right okay okay that's a person that was alright thank you uh your sense of humor never fails to amuse me so here's some bits
[319:14.82]Thank you.
[319:15.12]No, like, faked.
[319:15.66]That's...
[319:51.02]This is the life of the internet, though, guys.
[319:53.58]Don't you understand?
[319:55.44]The life of this super plugged-in technological bullshit where words don't even mean the words that they were supposed to mean to begin with?
[320:06.35]The word destiny, there's like four people that have that name and there's like three video games.
[320:13.15]Words don't even have meaning anymore.
[320:15.17]We're so plugged in that everybody has a fucking surname.
[320:18.23]Everybody has a fake name.
[320:20.82]And he put it in all capitals, too.
[320:31.69]Four people?
[320:32.35]I don't know, there's four people!
[320:36.31]There's, there's that guy Destiny, he's like a streamer, right?
[320:38.95]There's Dr. Dis for Destiny's Spect.
[320:41.77]There's... Destined for Love.
[320:45.56]Destiny the Game.
[320:47.08]Destiny 2.
[320:48.38]Right?
[320:50.39]Alright, alright, so this one guy, this one guy that has that name, and then a game, and that's it, okay?
[320:55.89]So, you know, I fucked up.
[320:58.02]I fucked up.
[320:59.46]You know, I fucked up.
[321:06.61]Destiny, man.
[321:21.43]Destiny's child.
[321:23.99]Yeah, this, dreamers.
[321:30.55]But thank you.
[321:31.31]I do appreciate it, Doobie.
[321:33.39]Wherever you came from.
[321:37.67]This chili of destiny, right?
[321:42.97]Love from Sweden.
[321:43.73]Thank you, Doobie Doo.
[321:45.87]MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $1, MooMeansMoo.
[321:47.73]Guys, it's the future.
[321:48.55]Just stop being poor.
[321:49.73]Forehead, Jerma985.
[321:51.03]When did I do that?
[321:51.83]I didn't do that.
[321:56.63]I never once said that.
[322:02.00]Snoozencopter, thanks for the $1.
[322:04.40]When I saw the title, when I saw the little vacuum robot, I thought, why would you need two robots in your house?
[322:09.98]But then I realized it's the perfect duo, R2-D2 and C-3PO.
[322:16.52]Yeah, for all the stuff that guy wanted, all he needed was an R2-D2.
[322:27.38]So many in the chat just says, seriously though, will you get timed out for 2017 memes?
[322:39.20]No.
[322:40.59]Oh, I just pressed the button.
[322:42.35]No, I didn't.
[322:42.71]I thought I just pressed stop stream.
[322:46.53]I got timed up for saying, ha ha.
[322:49.35]No, you didn't.
[322:50.88]Maybe you did, but why did you do it?
[322:52.70]You didn't, what, were you being a bad boy?
[322:54.28]Uh, where are we here?
[323:08.40]Thank you, mostly lost for the one dollar.
[323:10.02]You stare at yourself in the mirror for five minutes.
[323:13.00]Yup, sounds like ADHD.
[323:16.63]Sometimes you just need to know what you look like.
[323:20.83]Okay, hear me out here.
[323:24.44]As people, we don't get very much opportunity to know what we look like.
[323:31.54]You've got your bathroom mirror and your cell phone.
[323:37.44]And yes, I know that everybody in here can pretend to deny this.
[323:43.02]But how many, guys, how many low-key selfie pictures do you have of yourself on your iPhone right now of you using your phone as a mirror and taking a picture and looking at it to make sure that you look okay?
[323:58.61]There are probably 1 to 200 images on this iPhone of just my face staring blankly at the screen.
[324:07.88]I need to know.
[324:09.78]How do I look right now?
[324:11.42]I need to know.
[324:11.82]I'm not in my bathroom right now.
[324:13.88]I need to know what I look like right now.
[324:15.38]Is my mouth still attached?
[324:20.34]Is my nose flared out or something?
[324:22.04]Did I lose an eye?
[324:22.78]I need to see.
[324:38.10]Show them?
[324:38.88]No.
[324:41.70]You do realize that my pictures, everyone's like, oh no, I don't want anyone to, what if my photos leak?
[324:48.81]Let me tell you something.
[324:51.21]The entirety of every picture I have ever taken with my phone has been one of two things.
[325:00.35]A picture of my dog lying on the bed, the couch, or out somewhere looking cute,
[325:08.04]or a still image of my face stone cold looking into the camera.
[325:12.74]There is not another picture on this phone.
[325:17.22]There isn't.
[325:18.44]There's none.
[325:19.51]Not one.
[325:23.83]If I have taken four or five hundred photos over the course of the last ten years,
[325:32.58]380 of them are, I gotta check and see what I look like right now, over 10 years.
[325:37.68]And, God, my dogs are fucking cute, aren't they?
[325:41.89]That's it.
[325:44.69]Or I think, like, a couple times I've, like, zoomed in real close on a bug that was standing still.
[325:48.91]And I got, like, a picture of the bug's face.
[325:51.53]Well, hold on, I can zoom in with my iPhone.
[325:53.77]What does a spider's face look like?
[325:56.11]Cool.
[326:06.53]You want to see the 10-year term of progression?
[326:08.77]It's pretty- it's boring.
[326:14.19]Alright, we've only got like 30 more minutes to go through like another three hours of it.
[326:19.33]You leave the shutter sound on?
[326:20.69]Yes, because I want to make sure it's- I like that it's the pretend sound.
[326:24.93]Having no sound just feels odd.
[326:26.65]It just doesn't- I feel like I'm pressing screen cap.
[326:29.01]Like print screen on my computer.
[326:30.75]I wish when I pressed print screen that it went Like it does when you do it on Steam.
[326:44.08]Anyways, thank you to Mostly Lost for the $1.
[326:49.06]I don't know what year this story takes place, but the Lions still probably haven't won a Super Bowl.
[326:55.63]Yeah, and they never will.
[326:59.53]I'm kidding.
[327:00.93]They probably will.
[327:02.13]Statistically speaking, in like another couple hundred years, they might win once or twice.
[327:06.24]Depends on who they get.
[327:07.54]I don't know.
[327:07.82]I don't watch football.
[327:09.90]American football.
[327:10.70]Sorry.
[327:11.34]Everyone, don't throw Molotovs in my room
[327:20.08]Uh, thank you, TeraLacren, for the one dollar.
[327:23.10]I agree with you on the look at yourself non-stop in the mirror without blinking for five minutes thing, Jerma.
[327:28.08]You start looking like a monster.
[327:29.96]But to be honest, when you put on face cam, it happens immediately.
[327:35.95]Yeah.
[327:38.01]Yeah, that, you know, that gets, that gets a from me.
[327:44.98]Hey, Sprite37, thanks for the one dollar.
[327:47.87]As someone who worked on shows like Bee and Puppycat and more recently Sonic Mania Adventures, I can definitely confirm that not only do we use a mirror to reference emotions, we generally make the faces when we're drawing without a mirror subconsciously.
[328:03.44]See?
[328:08.10]See?
[328:09.39]Look at that.
[328:12.05]Thank you, Sprite.
[328:13.55]Dropping the knowledge on us.
[328:18.64]I wasn't crazy.
[328:19.72]That's how people do that.
[328:24.76]Very true.
[328:25.48]Right?
[328:25.70]See?
[328:25.92]Hypo, right?
[328:26.60]I knew you guys would have my back on this one.
[328:38.69]Also, thank you to Tara Lackron again for the $2.
[328:42.31]Jerma, I live in Detroit in real life.
[328:44.57]Seeing this game is actually super fun.
[328:46.71]The Grinch statue...
[328:48.67]is a big statue in downtown Detroit called the Spirit of Detroit.
[328:56.40]Is it the Grinch?
[328:57.96]Because that would be fucking awesome.
[329:01.18]Can you imagine if like in the middle of your city center, the Grinch was a big bronze statue?
[329:07.44]That would be amazing.
[329:13.04]That would be awesome.
[329:17.45]No, it's not the Grinch.
[329:18.85]Remember, these bits are from like four hours ago.
[329:32.98]Thank you, Zarina, for the $1.
[329:34.36]Johnny, get your gun.
[329:43.59]What did I do?
[329:44.31]Why are you doing this?
[329:49.98]That's a huge risk.
[329:50.90]He can steal all your presents.
[329:56.11]No.
[329:58.43]Where's Detroit?
[329:59.75]Detroit's in Orlando, right?
[330:03.98]It's a province in Orlando, Florida?
[330:06.18]It's Detroit, Orlando, Florida, right?
[330:07.86]That's where Disney World is?
[330:18.29]I couldn't hold that one in, I'm sorry.
[330:32.99]It's a World War I song?
[330:35.09]I don't sing songs for money.
[330:38.49]Thank you Carve Row for the $1.
[330:39.95]Only Jerma can make his audience laugh by standing in front of a mirror and being totally silent.
[330:47.51]I'm sure there's other people that could.
[330:50.13]I don't think I'm the only one.
[330:52.70]Polo Juice, again, thanks for the $100.
[330:54.32]$200 total tonight.
[330:56.82]Fucking crazy.
[330:58.18]Out of control.
[330:59.42]Big money.
[331:01.00]Thanks.
[331:01.20]Thank you.
[331:04.31]Ivory, thanks for the $1.
[331:05.99]One whole year subscribing to this nerd and I wouldn't want it any other way.
[331:11.79]Also, why do you have a gold-plated art piece of two antelopes mating?
[331:18.70]I don't know.
[331:19.84]It was a gift.
[331:21.22]That's all I know.
[331:24.06]That's all I know.
[331:27.96]It didn't make me laugh.
[331:32.02]Well, I'm not supposed to.
[331:33.20]I'm just observing.
[331:37.20]I'm observing.
[331:40.50]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[331:41.66]The outside as a painting joke literally made me want to unsub.
[331:46.71]Well, it
[331:49.78]Simply making an observation.
[331:55.03]Voice crap.
[331:57.41]Whatever.
[332:00.03]My throat's been bothering me.
[332:00.99]I've had a cough.
[332:01.59]I've had all kinds of problems with my throat and my body.
[332:07.15]Come on.
[332:11.43]Hole of one zombie.
[332:12.23]Thanks for the $1.
[332:12.93]Stop staring at random people in bars.
[332:14.71]They aren't mirrors.
[332:19.12]Oh yeah.
[332:19.60]I figured that one out.
[332:20.26]First two sentences he said.
[332:20.98]Terrible.
[332:21.24]No.
[332:21.32]No.
[332:48.81]We're going to stream tomorrow.
[332:50.64]And then... Probably... Because I really want to get this perfect.
[332:55.52]I'll probably stream... You know, I might stream on... No, I will.
[333:01.64]Nothing on Thursday.
[333:03.89]But... Either Friday or Saturday, we'll probably do something.
[333:08.77]But I really have to get prepared for Sunday.
[333:12.01]So... There might be something Friday or Saturday.
[333:17.72]I don't know.
[333:21.33]But I'm going to make sure to go tomorrow to make up for the fact that if I don't do anything Friday or Saturday, it's because the third stream will be Sunday and it's the polygraph.
[333:30.83]So there you go.
[333:33.30]Dark Souls on Friday.
[333:34.42]Now that requires a lot of attention that I can't give it to over the weekend.
[333:37.64]So we'll see.
[333:41.04]I'll figure it out.
[333:43.45]Yeah, if you joined late and you didn't hear what I was saying before, the Polygraph stream is this Sunday at 4.30 Eastern Time, PM, Sunday afternoon.
[333:57.63]Should be fun.
[333:58.99]Make sure you get your questions voted.
[334:00.15]Make sure you go to the Discord and you guys figure out what your top 20, 30, so-odd questions are going to be.
[334:06.59]Check it out.
[334:14.86]uh uh thank you uh senka senkai I don't know how you say this my brain is too small thank you uh I'm gonna call you a sink thank you for the one dollar sake long time viewer first time live though hey welcome hope you enjoyed this trip oh wallace thanks for the one dollar team cara
[334:37.64]Yeah, she probably has the most interesting storyline so far.
[334:40.36]Connor and Kara are my two favorite kind of scenarios going on.
[334:46.87]They seem to have the most choices.
[334:47.97]Marcus's choices are just... You kind of walk around with an old guy, and then you walk around and take pictures of weird images.
[334:56.01]His story has been pretty meh.
[335:03.28]But thank you.
[335:03.70]Thank you, Bake Me Home for the $5.00.
[335:06.70]Jesus Christ, Jerma, this stream has been hilarious.
[335:09.65]+2 times a hundred.
[335:11.11]Damn.
[335:13.67]You're going to give me 200 points here?
[335:15.05]Thank you, man.
[335:18.91]Marcus is a straight line.
[335:20.15]Yeah.
[335:22.26]I'm not sure if that was a necessity to have somebody have to be in the same place at the same time.
[335:29.32]Because it would make more sense if...
[335:31.52]The storylines start to converge here, which they've already started to.
[335:35.14]And maybe they overshot it a little bit.
[335:37.42]Oh, let's have three separate stories that you can choose how they... Well, we need sort of an anchor point.
[335:45.08]Marcus kind of feels like the anchor point that everyone has to kind of... Because he can only go pretty much in a straight line.
[335:51.40]I could be wrong.
[335:51.98]I don't know.
[335:52.26]We're pretty much halfway through the game, so we'll see.
[335:58.08]But thank you, Bake Me Home.
[335:58.84]I appreciate that.
[336:01.52]Wiggle, rat, thanks for the five dollars.
[336:03.16]We live in a society.
[336:05.04]Yep.
[336:06.64]You and I have agreed that I will exchange goods and services for you for money.
[336:11.87]We live in our own houses.
[336:13.73]We agree that we are going to share this space, which is our street.
[336:18.31]I know I'm not going to come up to your house and knock on your door and break it open and be like, hey, fuck you.
[336:23.13]We have a series of laws, so no, we live in a society.
[336:25.39]That's correct.
[336:29.86]uh thank you casey casey for the one dollar new gorillas album coming out June 29th it's called the now now that is that true that's true that's that is true the now now
[337:05.34]That's cool.
[337:06.24]I mean, the last album was really good.
[337:10.30]I think some of the... There was probably... They kind of went all over the place in that album, though.
[337:17.95]This one that came out this past year.
[337:21.57]So... I hope it's not just kind of... Hey, here's like a bunch of other songs that I have lying around.
[337:28.62]I mean, maybe it probably is.
[337:34.79]Because I feel like half the songs on the latest album were really, really great.
[337:40.31]And the other half were just kind of like experiments.
[337:43.92]Like out of control.
[337:44.68]Like just experimentation.
[337:46.50]Which, that's cool.
[337:52.58]We'll see.
[337:57.17]But yeah, thanks for the heads up.
[337:58.55]I did not know that was happening.
[337:59.95]I will definitely listen to it.
[338:03.29]I would probably agree with you.
[338:10.46]I heard that you were thinking about doing it.
[338:11.80]Yes.
[338:14.40]There is going to be an ASMR stream.
[338:16.08]I already talked about it.
[338:18.88]I'm going to get one of those fucking dumb mannequin head microphones.
[338:25.18]I'm going to be... It's going to be wild.
[338:28.02]It's not what you expect.
[338:30.14]I'm going to give you a spoiler here.
[338:31.72]Spoiler alert.
[338:32.92]I'm going to hire a marching band to come in and do a marching band in the room.
[338:37.20]It's going to be fucking wild.
[338:39.08]I don't even care if I spoil that because it's going to be funny either way.
[338:43.42]I don't even care.
[338:45.28]I cannot wait to do that.
[338:50.81]You guys know that there's plenty more after that, so don't worry.
[338:56.57]The lie detecting stream is Sunday, actually.
[338:59.65]You probably just came in.
[339:00.67]Sunday at 4.30 p.m.
[339:01.85]is the Polygraph stream.
[339:09.46]Yes, that's for real.
[339:10.14]I'm actually doing it.
[339:13.08]Thank you to the Orange Pyro Ranger for the $1.
[339:16.19]I swear if you don't go to the motel, I'm going to have an aneurysm.
[339:18.61]I did.
[339:18.87]I did.
[339:21.26]Casey, thanks for the $1.
[339:22.24]I went to a music festival this weekend.
[339:23.84]Forgot to use sunscreen.
[339:25.10]Now my face is redder than a baboon's ass.
[339:28.27]In fact, I kind of look like jermaSnort.
[339:30.27]Use sunscreen if you don't want to go to fucking jail, kids.
[339:34.11]Good tip.
[339:35.99]Hope you're alright.
[339:36.63]Hope you're healing.
[339:38.88]Stormichu earlier gave $25.
[339:40.18]Thank you, Stormichu.
[339:43.68]My blood pressure is actually rising watching you play this game.
[339:49.44]I just burped a lot, but you didn't even hear it.
[339:52.15]But I guess that's why you're one of the best streamers out there.
[340:00.49]Thanks.
[340:01.47]Thank you, Stormy Chu, for the $25.
[340:05.90]Sunburnt snort.
[340:08.02]Yeah, there it is.
[340:10.94]The motel versus car debate tore chat apart.
[340:16.15]Something about that just makes me laugh.
[340:19.05]I'm going to sneeze, by the way, and I'm not feuding the microphone.
[340:21.29]You know?
[340:25.84]Oh.

[341:46.57]Liquid Slam.
[341:47.29]What the fuck is Liquid Slam?
[341:53.43]Okay, is that Capri, son?
[341:59.37]Liquid Slam is way cooler than Capri Sun.
[342:09.52]Oh, no.
[342:09.98]Okay, hold on.
[342:13.56]There's a twist here.
[342:14.24]There's an M. Light Shyamalan here.
[342:19.25]I've seen it.
[342:19.81]I've seen it.
[342:20.23]I've heard it.
[342:25.07]Thank you, though.
[342:28.36]I've seen it.
[342:28.84]I've heard it.
[342:30.08]Thank you, Garfield, the Monday Killer.
[342:32.06]He skipped ahead.
[342:39.16]Thank you, Garfield, the Monday Killer, for the $1.
[342:42.20]You're bringing me back to a bad place with the dumpster talk.
[342:45.05]Mama Garf raised me in a dumpster by an Italian restaurant and fed me food they threw out.
[342:50.96]Life was hard back then, but that food was garfalicious, know what I'm saying?
[342:55.32]Speaking of food, my girlfriend is pescatarian.
[342:58.10]They're like vegetarians that eat fish.
[343:00.22]That means no traditional lasagna, only veggie stuff now.
[343:03.71]Now tell me, Jeremy boy, you're a healthy young lad with a sleek physical apparatus.
[343:08.49]What food should I cook?
[343:12.63]Shit in a diaper and then put that on the skillet and carve it up, put it in a hot dog bun and eat it.
[343:24.12]How many people are here?
[343:25.77]How many people are watching?
[343:28.35]How many viewers are here right now?
[343:29.75]Okay, only a thousand people heard that.
[343:35.01]So, that's good.
[343:36.89]Like a third, like 40% of the audience heard that, so it's alright.
[343:44.63]You can never prove a thing.
[343:45.49]I'll just pretend you doctored it.
[343:47.61]You took a clip and you, like, fucking pieced it together.
[343:49.37]You put, like, an audio program and then you, like, got the clip and you made... Yeah, I didn't say that.
[344:00.30]Food you should make.
[344:02.06]Make pan-seared salmon.
[344:05.42]My go-to.
[344:06.14]I love it.
[344:07.34]Or like a turkey sandwich.
[344:08.86]Pretty good.
[344:09.52]Thank you, Garfield.
[344:10.50]Thank you, Zarina, for the one dollar.
[344:13.92]Suck a tire or riot.
[344:18.44]What?
[344:21.62]What?
[344:22.10]What?
[344:24.34]What?
[344:24.52]They're just gonna watch the VOD.
[344:27.63]Yeah, they're not gonna get this far.
[344:30.08]But you know, they're not going to get this far.
[344:31.76]They're going to watch the VOD.
[344:32.54]They're going to see the part where I say, and alright, guys, see you tomorrow.
[344:36.87]And we're going to step off where we left off.
[344:39.37]And see you tomorrow.
[344:42.05]Okay, bye.
[344:48.70]Thank you, Zarina.
[344:51.66]Hey, Frexter, thanks for the three bucks.
[344:53.60]Thank you for giving this game an honest chance, despite how negative chat was about it.
[344:57.46]Were they?
[345:00.99]Were you guys negative about this game?
[345:04.23]I don't remember seeing very much negativity.
[345:13.61]Maybe there was.
[345:14.13]Chat is negative about everything.
[345:17.91]Yeah, chat seems to be negative about every game.
[345:27.39]I mean, depending on how this keeps going, it's holding my attention, let's say that.
[345:36.66]I don't think this is the best game I've ever played in my life, but it is holding my attention.
[345:43.29]I will give you a stamp of approval or a stamp of get out of.
[345:47.54]Like, get the fuck out of here.
[345:49.38]Those are my two indications.
[345:50.48]It's stamp of approval, recommend, or get this fucking thing out of here and throw it in the garbage can.
[345:56.91]I don't have an in-between.
[346:06.45]Get out of here.
[346:13.81]No.
[346:15.63]It's enjoyable so far for what it is.
[346:20.34]What would you give the Get Outta Here tier?
[346:23.42]Evil Within 2.
[346:26.06]That's the extreme of Get Outta Here.
[346:30.17]I would say there's Get Outta Here.
[346:31.11]That's like a 5 or a 6 out of 10.
[346:37.39]You've got like, I recommend, you know, it's pretty good.
[346:41.43]Pretty good.
[346:41.85]That would be like a 7, right?
[346:44.05]An 8 would be stamp that recommendation.
[346:46.37]You've heard me say that before.
[346:48.07]A 9 or a 10 is fucking double stamp awesome.
[346:51.96]Absolutely recommend.
[346:53.90]Once you get down to 4, 6, right?
[346:56.02]Like 6 is like, get out of here.
[346:57.52]You've heard me say that before in games that weren't that great, but they weren't bad.
[347:01.08]Then like a 4 is like, get the fuck out of here.
[347:04.53]Get out of here.
[347:05.89]I've said that about a couple of games.
[347:07.37]But the Evil Within 2 actually physically and mentally put me into a spiral.
[347:14.36]And it wasn't just get out of here.
[347:15.66]It was this is the fucking worst shit ever.
[347:18.92]Get the fuck out of my life.
[347:21.80]So that's where your scale is.
[347:23.53]Evil Within 2 to House Flipper would be 10.
[347:27.81]No, it wouldn't.
[347:28.47]It would be like 7.
[347:33.88]House Flipper was fun, but I don't know if I could... I couldn't... Oh, shit!
[347:37.46]We only got 13 minutes!
[347:44.01]Get out of here!
[347:49.55]House Flipper is better than Bloodborne.
[347:52.43]I don't know if we're gonna... No, we're definitely not gonna do this in 13 minutes.
[347:55.02]Yes, we are.
[347:57.18]Didn't Evil Within 2 almost make me quit streaming?
[347:59.80]Yes, it did.
[348:03.46]I went through like an internal struggle where I was like contemplating just never streaming again.
[348:11.94]I was sitting there just like, I'm never fucking doing it again.
[348:14.35]I'm never streaming again.
[348:23.06]To be fair though, that same thing happened during Kingdom Come.
[348:28.52]Like the first four hours of Kingdom Come.
[348:31.02]Which eventually I got over it, and that turned out to be a pretty fun game, right?
[348:36.99]There's only been two streams, I think, where I've decided I was going to quit streaming.
[348:40.73]And that was Kingdom Come, the first stream, and The Evil Within 2.
[348:45.88]That's it.
[348:47.10]And I've streamed hundreds of times, right?
[348:49.14]We're talking hundreds and hundreds of times.
[348:52.42]So, if you got two, like, I'm out of here, I'm quitting streaming, from two times out of, like, four or five hundred, that's, what percentage is that, right?
[349:03.29]I've only threatened to quit twice in the three years that I've been working here at twitch.tv, you know?
[349:07.83]That's fine.
[349:11.51]What about Skate 3?
[349:12.29]No, Skate 3 was one of the worst streams I've ever done.
[349:15.44]But I didn't, like, threaten to quit.
[349:18.06]I didn't threaten to quit streaming during Skate 3.
[349:22.58]I just said it was the worst stream ever.
[349:23.94]Same thing with Karazhan.
[349:27.06]Did I threaten to quit streams with Karazhan?
[349:30.66]No.
[349:32.88]I did with Kingdom Come, though.
[349:41.20]You threatened to stop streaming for a year earlier today.
[349:43.80]Oh, you're right.
[349:47.56]How often do I say I'm going to quit streaming?
[349:50.10]Yeah, but like, that's a joke like 90% of the time I say it.
[350:00.26]You play so many bad games, but Evil Within 2 and Kingdom Come really pushed you.
[350:05.08]Now, I retract my Kingdom Come statement.
[350:07.79]Remember I went over the retraction?
[350:09.21]I did my apology tour.
[350:11.17]Right?
[350:11.39]I apologized to everybody because I was wrong.
[350:15.11]But Evil Within 2, I don't know what it is.
[350:17.75]It's my Bob Barker in Happy Gilmore.
[350:22.96]Oh, I hated every single second of that game.
[350:29.21]I don't know what it did.
[350:29.77]I don't know why.
[350:30.27]It was just destiny.
[350:31.19]It was just destiny.
[350:32.47]We're going to use that word.
[350:37.77]He was just drunk during the Kingdom Come stream.
[350:40.07]Yeah, I mean, I was drinking.
[350:41.82]I was... I had a few.
[350:42.94]Oh, shit.
[350:49.70]We have bits.
[350:51.04]Alright.
[350:51.36]Alright.
[350:51.66]Let's go.
[350:52.02]Let's go.
[350:54.02]Long story short, Evil Within 2 is probably a pretty decent game.
[350:56.28]Kingdom Come was a good game.
[350:58.48]Sometimes I have two drinks and I get a little angry.
[351:05.07]I don't, though.
[351:05.61]I don't.
[351:05.85]I'm kidding.
[351:06.25]That's a joke, too.
[351:07.21]Alright.
[351:07.51]Thank you.
[351:13.39]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $1.
[351:15.17]When is the Dark Souls Remastered stream going to happen?
[351:18.17]Probably not for a little while.
[351:20.07]I would say at least a couple of weeks.
[351:22.88]Hey, Gordon Fisherman, thanks for the $5.
[351:25.14]Can't wait for your official podcast episode, Jeremy.
[351:27.10]Have fun.
[351:27.76]Yes, it should be fun.
[351:30.70]I will be on that.
[351:32.16]Be recording it at some point in June, I think.
[351:36.77]Should be interesting.
[351:39.35]Thank you to Darkstar for the $1.
[351:41.43]Darkstar7000, I wasn't so sure about this game, but seeing this android try to befriend an android racist fills me with joy.
[351:48.01]It's so good.
[351:51.37]It's growing on me, it is.
[351:55.95]It's been enjoyable.
[351:58.01]Hey, Gabe DeGrossi, thanks for the $1.
[351:59.35]Yo, Jerm, I haven't cheered in a while.
[352:01.73]Been busy.
[352:02.89]Have you got any tips for beginning on free weights?
[352:06.25]I'm tired of mechanical ones, but I don't know what I'm doing in the gym.
[352:11.82]Yes, just make sure when you do free weights, this is the only advice I can really give, is start very small.
[352:20.98]I'm talking embarrassingly small.
[352:23.26]And don't worry, the dickhead at the gym, no one's looking at you.
[352:27.32]Nobody cares.
[352:28.84]But to learn proper form with free weights, you've got to start really light.
[352:33.93]Light enough where it's a slight challenge for you, but don't start throwing around free weights.
[352:38.15]You'll hurt yourself.
[352:40.41]A lot of people just grab fucking big heavy weights and they want to look like, I can do this, I'm going to lie down and do this one.
[352:46.68]And you're going to get hurt.
[352:51.73]So you want to start probably 30% lighter than what you normally would just to make sure you can get proper form with free weights down.
[352:58.79]And then, you know, work yourself up from there.
[353:03.89]A lot of people start too heavy with free weights.
[353:12.08]But yeah, that's pretty much the advice that I got for that.
[353:17.26]Says the guy that hasn't, like, really worked out in, like, two years.
[353:19.72]But I used to a lot.
[353:21.06]It used to be my whole life.
[353:28.26]Oh, but thank you, Gabe DeGrossi.
[353:29.20]Thank you, Morning Maple, for the $1 of the marathon.
[353:30.50]What marathon?
[353:33.68]What are you talking about?
[353:40.65]What marathon?
[353:46.96]Did I run a marathon?
[353:53.53]They said, thank you, Morning Maple, for the $1.
[353:59.05]Six minutes.
[353:59.53]I'm fine.
[353:59.92]I'm fine.
[354:00.54]Brolock, thanks for the $1.
[354:01.82]Thanks, Jeremiah.
[354:02.32]You made the mom character look like someone from my work.
[354:06.28]Had to turn the stream off during those scenes.
[354:12.67]Oh, that's so funny.
[354:14.83]Imagine like you walk in on a co-worker and he's watching somebody play a game where they're playing as you But that's not them playing You would think that that person told me to make you in your likeness in the game so we could both like watch her That's fucking weird, man Thank God for tabs, right?
[354:37.22]Hey, it's poor Zora.
[354:38.54]Thanks for the $1.
[354:39.26]Appreciate it smelly boy.
[354:40.26]Thanks for the $1 I just came back after four hours and you sound tired and upset.
[354:43.54]I
[354:44.92]Clay Simpson's family.
[354:47.52]No, I'm just running out of gas.
[354:50.05]You guys can tell when I run out of gas.
[354:53.01]I run out of gas, and then we get to the gas station, which is the last hour of the stream.
[354:58.31]So four hours will go by doing whatever we're doing, and I'm just out of gas.
[355:02.57]I gotta get a gas station.
[355:04.69]Pull over.
[355:05.25]Okay, that's it.
[355:07.87]Fill up at the gas station, which is this last hour or so.
[355:10.47]Just hang out.
[355:13.00]quarter tank.
[355:13.60]I got a goal.
[355:14.76]I got like two minutes.
[355:16.46]Thank you for the $1.
[355:18.59]Smelly boy, thanks for $1 again.
[355:21.61]Also, as a Michigander myself, let me just say, eat my ass.
[355:26.49]Thank you.
[355:27.93]Sly161, thanks for the $1.
[355:30.25]Do androids dream of electric speed?
[355:33.92]I don't know.
[355:34.70]You'll have to ask them.
[355:35.94]Thank you, Sly.
[355:37.26]Mostly lost, thanks for the $1.
[355:38.52]Correction, it's 2031, so the Lions definitely still haven't won the Super Bowl.
[355:43.07]Probably not.
[355:44.87]They're not a bad team.
[355:45.59]They lost like 12 games last year.
[355:47.81]I mean, that's terrible, but they're not that bad.
[355:50.63]You know, they're making some good draft decisions, I think, this year.
[355:53.85]Samuel Sish, thanks for the $1.
[355:55.20]My six-month badge is gone, and so is my Jerma expensive emote.
[355:58.28]Now I'm sad.
[356:00.84]Well, I mean, there's only like 10 people that have that emote.
[356:07.10]There's 10 people.
[356:09.34]Laugh, that was a good joke.
[356:10.68]Laugh at my humor.
[356:18.61]But thank you.
[356:20.85]Sorry to hear that.
[356:22.51]Zero Giblets.
[356:23.63]Thanks for the $1.
[356:24.73]Hey, Jerma, fun fact.
[356:25.55]That room with the pigeons was probably super deadly to your partner as dried bird poop in large amounts produce a fungus that destroys your lungs and can be easily fatal if inhaled.
[356:35.24]There's your fact.
[356:36.82]Love you, by the way.
[356:38.86]Thank you, Zero.
[356:40.60]Good pigeon tip.
[356:41.86]I'm always ears for a pigeon tip.
[356:47.92]Really?
[356:51.06]Is there?
[356:51.36]I thought this game was like 8 to 10 hours long.
[356:59.08]That's not true.
[357:01.19]All the things I've read about this and everything I've looked up says that it's like 10 hours, give or take.
[357:07.71]It's not like a 16 to 20 hour game.
[357:14.96]That's a huge game, if that's the case.
[357:19.36]12 to 14.
[357:19.72]Yeah, I mean, that's... I could see, like, 12 to 14.
[357:29.41]It's a long game.
[357:30.53]At least two more streams.
[357:31.83]Well, looks like I know what we're doing on fucking Friday or Saturday.
[357:35.93]But yeah, we'll see.
[357:43.79]Thank you, MostlyLostForTheOneDollar.
[357:45.39]You always read subnames right up against the top of the screen, and it gives me so much anxiety.
[357:54.46]What about the guy reading them?
[357:57.78]Me too.
[357:59.28]But it happens.
[358:01.48]Thank you, CluelessSniperForTheOneDollar.
[358:03.02]Hey, Jerma, E3 is next weekend.
[358:04.42]Will you be streaming any conferences like last year?
[358:07.91]No, I'm not going to E3.
[358:09.33]I won't be around.
[358:11.86]Uh, my E3 budget was instead used on going to Nevada to take a look and find a place to stay.
[358:23.65]So won't be participating at E3 this year.
[358:27.01]Decided to go find a new place to live.
[358:29.65]And I don't have money to be flying around and going to every convention.
[358:36.40]It's a lot of money.
[358:38.04]Going out to California for four days.
[358:40.48]Staying in hotels.
[358:43.28]I don't have money to do that.
[358:44.58]Because I also want to do the Nevada trip too.
[358:51.32]But hopefully there's something cool this year.
[358:53.34]I'm sure I'll be watching.
[358:55.32]Am I streaming it though?
[358:56.52]Can you stream it?
[358:59.20]Hold on.
[358:59.98]I can like restream E3.
[359:01.82]And we can just like talk a bunch of shit.
[359:07.65]Maybe we'll do that.
[359:08.73]Maybe that's what we'll do on Saturday.
[359:11.47]Or whenever it is.
[359:14.65]You did it.
[359:16.03]You did it last year.
[359:17.09]Yeah, I know, but I don't know.
[359:17.97]Was I breaking any laws?
[359:19.83]I don't know.
[359:20.17]I didn't look it up.
[359:25.61]Yeah, maybe we'll do that.
[359:29.05]Thank you, Greethan, for the $1.
[359:32.57]Do you ever play Viva Pinata, please?
[359:34.43]I feel like you'd really like it.
[359:38.96]Hmm.
[359:39.88]Maybe.
[359:42.96]Maybe.
[359:44.28]Sounds like an interesting idea.
[359:46.24]Thank you for the extra dollar here, Greethran.
[359:47.74]Appreciate it.
[359:49.39]CJ the Dog thinks of the $1.
[359:50.79]Hey, I know I'm late, but wanted you to know if you'd ever stream Bloodborne.
[359:54.57]I picked it up because of you and it has become one of my favorite games.
[359:58.02]I've answered this before, but the answer is no.
[360:00.51]I'm not going to stream Bloodborne because I've beaten it too many times.
[360:04.43]I've played as every potential stat-based character.
[360:09.37]I've done every bit of the DLC.
[360:11.65]I know every... It wouldn't be a stream that I'd want to do.
[360:15.95]Just because... It would be me doing the same thing I've done, like, almost a half dozen times now.
[360:24.30]So, it wouldn't be a good and enjoyable stream, I don't think.
[360:28.92]But I highly recommend you play it.
[360:30.06]It's one of the best games I've ever played.
[360:37.99]Streamer knows all.
[360:39.75]Quota missed.
[360:40.61]Oh, we're over six hours.
[360:41.65]Whatever.
[360:42.65]Doesn't matter.
[360:44.87]Am I wearing pants?
[360:45.75]I'm wearing shorts.
[360:47.09]Currently.
[360:47.79]I mean, I was naked and I put pants on because I had to.
[360:50.02]I'm getting yelled at.
[360:57.56]am I moving for sure because I live in New Hampshire and it feels cool to have my favorite streamer only a state away well I yeah it is pretty much a it's set in stone that I'm moving to the west coast set in stone just where I'm not so sure
[361:16.69]But thank you, Cult of Personality, for the $1.
[361:18.43]Hey, man, I hope I ain't tipping too late this time.
[361:20.77]No special message.
[361:21.65]Just say hi to you in chat.
[361:24.55]Also, say hello to my friend, Valen.
[361:28.07]Big fan of yours.
[361:29.63]Good night.
[361:30.09]Hey, thanks, Cult of Personality.
[361:31.29]And hey, Valen.
[361:34.31]Hope you're having a good night as well.
[361:38.01]SirFeline, thanks for the $1.
[361:39.25]Life is pain and they hate.
[361:41.53]BroLuck, thanks for the $1.
[361:42.71]Plug, Phone, and DermaMustard, show us all the photos.
[361:45.59]Chat Riot for the photos.
[361:47.53]You're not going to tap into my phone and see my personal iPhone photos.
[361:55.28]Collectively, you guys are doing the thing that nobody ever likes.
[362:00.86]I'm on my phone and you guys are leaning over my shoulder to see what I'm doing on the phone.
[362:07.54]Nobody likes that.
[362:09.06]So do you think I want to have a thousand people collectively look over my shoulder on my personal cell phone?
[362:14.85]Huh?
[362:16.73]What if it happens in privacy?
[362:23.45]Probably has nude.
[362:24.23]I don't have any nude pictures on my phone.
[362:26.11]What do you think I am?
[362:32.31]What do you think I am?
[362:33.11]Think I got a wooden skull?
[362:37.19]All of my nude pictures are in person.
[362:39.87]They've all... I got them developed.
[362:40.93]They're all here.
[362:41.85]All of my naked photos, they're all sitting in here.
[362:45.26]There's 2,000 of them, just about.
[362:50.02]Nobody can see them.
[362:52.20]Not gonna get stuck on a server somewhere.
[362:53.76]Not in the cloud.
[362:55.01]Not data hackable.
[362:55.99]They're alright here.
[363:10.00]They're physicals.
[363:10.56]Why would you ever... Why would you ever have a digital copy of something like that?
[363:14.26]No.
[363:14.42]I feel personal that way when it's real.
[363:18.32]A lot of piece of zeros and ones.
[363:27.23]Mostly lost.
[363:27.83]Thanks for the $1.
[363:28.53]Please upload those pictures on your iPhone.
[363:30.29]Please.
[363:32.94]Hey, Doobie Doo.
[363:33.60]Thanks for the $1.
[363:34.34]Destiny Man for next Jerma Rumble.
[363:37.87]Vera, like, thanks for the 15 bucks.
[363:39.53]Appreciate the $15 drop here.
[363:41.45]Release your book, but every page is just your blank-faced selfies.
[363:46.00]Somebody already did that.
[363:48.88]I know for a fact.
[363:49.48]We've talked about this before.
[363:51.06]Somebody already did that.
[363:52.22]They did a book where it was, like, 20 pages long, and it was half of it was selfies of themselves and their favorite playlists, and maybe, like, four pages of actual content.
[364:03.67]It's pretty funny.
[364:06.86]Hey, Magnus Burnside, thanks for the $1.
[364:10.56]Jerma, yippee.
[364:12.32]Thank you.
[364:15.80]Son of Jenova, thanks for the $1.
[364:17.12]Here's another fan art so chat doesn't think I'm a pervert.
[364:20.07]Also, because you never hugged Gio.
[364:23.51]Bible thumb.
[364:28.45]Well, yeah, I... I mean, you didn't... There you go.
[364:38.53]That fucking hair.
[364:39.39]I don't even have that hair anymore.
[364:40.85]By the way, I went back and looked at, like, clips of me with that hair.
[364:44.93]Why didn't anybody tell me to cut my hair?
[364:46.37]Like, that should have been the only thing you guys said in chat.
[364:51.61]No one should have said another word.
[364:54.29]It should have only been, get a haircut.
[364:58.09]I'm... Yeah, you... We did.
[365:02.22]We did.
[365:02.92]I know, but I don't know.
[365:03.78]Listen to me.
[365:05.66]It should have been the only thing you said.
[365:08.48]It should have been the ONLY fucking thing you ever said.
[365:12.56]I would be playing a game, no, haircut, haircut, haircut, and I would have to turn the stream off.
[365:23.35]When am I finishing the game?
[365:24.21]We weren't paying attention.
[365:24.97]Tomorrow.
[365:26.65]Gonna try to get as far as we can tomorrow afternoon.
[365:28.85]Same time, probably around like 5 p.m.
[365:30.51]Eastern starting and going probably another six hours or so.
[365:41.40]Oh, that's funny.
[365:43.19]Thank you, Son of Jenova, for the fan author.
[365:47.17]Appreciate it.
[365:48.63]Getting close to the end here.
[365:49.53]Clink180, thanks for the $1.
[365:50.93]Hey, Jarva.
[365:52.26]I got back from a trip to Taiwan.
[365:54.48]Got a bit of jet lag going on.
[365:55.74]I've got a question about how to stay motivated with online content.
[365:59.70]been trying to get into the scene but all my friends have somehow managed to do better than me it's tough to stay engaged is there a good way to stay motivated early on yes it's I'm glad you brought that part of your statement up uh lesson one never compare yourself to somebody else ever never
[366:24.60]Once you start comparing yourself to another person that may or may not be doing better than you are, or worse, or... Focus on what you're doing.
[366:34.11]Because the more that you focus on somebody else, you're like hamstringing yourself to always try to be better than that person.
[366:42.58]You shouldn't be doing that.
[366:43.88]Focus on what you're doing and the content that you're making.
[366:47.84]You should not pay attention to anybody else.
[366:51.86]And secondly...
[366:55.60]The best way to stay motivated early on?
[366:59.38]Do something you like.
[367:01.54]It's really easy to stay motivated when you're doing something that you would probably like to do anyways.
[367:05.86]Something that you like doing.
[367:08.09]Don't ever chase views.
[367:09.99]Ever.
[367:11.45]Don't chase content.
[367:12.45]Don't chase views.
[367:13.33]Don't compare yourself to anybody.
[367:16.63]Do what you like to do and do it the best that you possibly fucking can.
[367:22.18]Do what you do, do it well, and love every second of it.
[367:27.27]When you start chasing views and chasing fucking subs and oh my fuck, how many do I have?
[367:32.27]How many views do I have?
[367:33.35]Fuck!
[367:34.73]You'll fall apart.
[367:45.02]It's really easy to fall into that because we're in such a, there's such a saturated market here of streamers and YouTubers and online content creators and even like the people that are showing artwork.
[367:58.38]Even artwork, music, there's so many people doing online content creation, doesn't matter what it is, that it's so easy to compare yourself to somebody.
[368:09.57]Well, I do this, and I think I'm... How many views does that person get?
[368:13.67]It's all about everybody.
[368:14.75]Everybody has something now, right?
[368:18.57]There's thousands, potentially hundreds of thousands of people all involved in some of these various online communities.
[368:27.16]Best advice I could ever give anybody, don't chase views, don't chase popularity, and don't compare yourself to your friends, or anybody else for that matter, because they aren't you.
[368:37.26]Because guess what?
[368:38.44]Eventually, down the road, if you fall into something or if you start doing something and people start watching, your other friends and other people are going to start to say the same damn thing about you.
[368:49.67]Well, why does he get the views now?
[368:51.53]What did he do?
[368:53.13]Well, I think my stream's better than his.
[368:55.38]Is it though?
[368:55.92]Yeah, it is.
[368:56.58]But fuck that guy.
[368:58.06]They'll start doing the same thing.
[369:06.93]That's the best advice I could probably give to content creation.
[369:12.75]And do it all the time.
[369:14.35]That's another one.
[369:16.03]A lot of people want to jump into something like online content creation and they... Do it... Maybe I'll make a video.
[369:25.33]Maybe I'll stream once.
[369:28.05]That was fun.
[369:29.67]And then they get demotivated because there was nobody there.
[369:33.70]But also, you've got to remember...
[369:35.68]It was like that for everybody else.
[369:38.04]You know, like think about, I'll give you a personal example.
[369:40.98]I mean, I was making YouTube videos back in 2011, 2000, even into 2012.
[369:47.57]I started to get more viewers in like late 2011, right?
[369:52.01]But I made probably a hundred videos with less than a thousand people watching.
[369:58.43]There were probably less than four or 500 views on my videos, on each video.
[370:04.25]for like a year but I wanted to do it I was having a good time doing it I didn't like it wasn't about how many people I can get there it was do I like the shit that I'm doing so saying that oh fuck everyone's getting more views than me what do I do all the people that you're referring to whether they're popular or not they all started at the same place
[370:29.86]Didn't you delete your first three videos?
[370:31.38]Probably.
[370:32.54]No, yes I did.
[370:33.28]Yeah, I did.
[370:34.08]I was going to quit.
[370:35.20]Because I did.
[370:36.64]You're right.
[370:37.06]You're absolutely right.
[370:38.51]I made three videos and I removed them.
[370:45.99]And then I re-uploaded them the next day.
[370:47.93]And I was like, fuck it.
[370:48.55]Why am I doing that?
[370:49.45]Because somebody told me.
[370:51.26]I had at least a couple people tell me.
[370:52.74]Like, what the fuck?
[370:53.26]Who cares?
[370:54.96]Just do it.
[371:00.14]Find the lost vid... No, they're there.
[371:02.42]It's the same first, like, three videos I made.
[371:05.26]I uploaded them, removed them, and then, like, a day or two later or something, put them back up.
[371:15.11]But that question comes up a lot, and something else that you need to keep in mind is... It's... It's not... Your life should not be about trying to...
[371:30.33]Gain as many points as possible.
[371:35.67]That shouldn't be the goal.
[371:37.49]And when I say points, I'm talking about favorites, retweets, likes, views.
[371:43.87]You'll drive yourself up a wall if that's the thing that you really care about.
[371:54.82]Money.
[371:55.10]There's another one.
[372:04.18]Do it because you want to do it.
[372:06.84]There shouldn't be any other motive there.
[372:14.38]But I feel like there is sort of a... There's a... And look, there is kind of like a culture here, right?
[372:21.58]Of... I gotta get fucking a thousand likes on my Instagram post!
[372:26.34]How many retweets did my tweet get?
[372:28.16]That's not enough!
[372:29.08]That's not enough!
[372:30.12]I need more tweets!
[372:32.77]And that's, I mean, we're hitting an apex, I think, or we're hitting the climax of that now.
[372:38.30]Where it's, that's like important to a lot of people.
[372:47.90]But you gotta pull yourself out of that mindset of views and tweets and points and favorites and number counts and people counters.
[373:07.59]And once you do that, you can start to just keep going.
[373:09.69]Do whatever you want.
[373:16.18]But with that, we're going to move on.
[373:25.18]Hopefully some of that rambling could help you out there.
[373:30.37]Wish you the best of luck.
[373:31.05]Keep going.
[373:31.73]Keep trying.
[373:33.05]Keep trying.
[373:39.97]Thank you to MooMeansMoo for the $5.
[373:43.03]Thanks for the great stream.
[373:43.81]I'm enjoying this game quite a bit.
[373:45.59]It's great fun watching you play it.
[373:46.99]Anyways, here's the coke I owe you.
[373:48.39]At least the bit equivalent of it.
[373:51.07]That's right.
[373:52.39]We did get a jinx there.
[373:58.98]Thank you, Moo.
[374:04.00]But, uh...
[374:07.54]What happened to the guy that played the egg?
[374:08.76]You're talking about Burger Boy.
[374:09.60]Yeah, Burger Boy just kind of just did it for fun.
[374:14.18]He was around in videos for fun.
[374:15.84]He's still around.
[374:16.50]I still talk to him.
[374:17.44]He's a good dude.
[374:18.68]He's got a family.
[374:20.95]He's just living the life, man.
[374:24.45]He's doing great.
[374:30.05]The Orange Pyro Ranger.
[374:31.21]Thanks for the $1.
[374:31.93]Did Vinny also give you a copy of his solo album called Room to Breathe?
[374:36.59]I believe so.
[374:37.89]He gave me a couple of albums.
[374:39.35]I believe one of them was that one.
[374:43.69]Thank you.
[374:44.19]Cloud was my original name for the $1.
[374:45.95]Hey, Jermba, how's it going?
[374:46.96]Missed the stream.
[374:47.46]Hope you had a good time playing in Detroit.
[374:50.18]Any new info on the hypercalcemia?
[374:53.92]It's too personal.
[374:54.62]No big deal.
[374:55.02]Hope you get better regardless.
[374:56.40]Yeah, actually, let me clear up something here.
[375:00.78]I may have scared some people when I talked about this a couple days ago.
[375:07.02]I just was kind of throwing it out there that I was going back to the doctor.
[375:11.20]And I may have potentially freaked some people out.
[375:15.27]So let me be very clear about something.
[375:18.95]I am fine.
[375:22.05]The only medical condition that I currently have is the colitis and headaches sometimes.
[375:29.29]But there was a slight, small abnormality in my calcium level.
[375:34.86]I'm going back on Thursday.
[375:36.08]We're going to go talk.
[375:37.10]I was told it could potentially just be a fluke.
[375:39.36]It's probably not a big deal.
[375:42.69]Don't worry.
[375:46.05]I don't want people to freak out about this.
[375:48.63]Because there's nothing there.
[375:51.85]I just happened to nonchalantly bring that up.
[375:58.96]I have no information on that.
[376:02.13]That was just a slight thing that I was like, huh, that's weird.
[376:05.01]Considering that I've had some issues with it in the past.
[376:10.65]But nothing to make a big stink over.
[376:15.02]Please don't... As I cough.
[376:19.34]Don't worry about me.
[376:20.06]I'm fine.
[376:21.74]I'm fine.
[376:27.03]It's Trump voice.
[376:28.69]Slight, small abnormality.
[376:30.69]Not a big deal.
[376:34.87]Yeah.
[376:35.73]Don't worry about me.
[376:37.85]I'm sorry if I may have caused some people to be concerned about that, but you really shouldn't be at all.
[376:45.35]From my understanding, if it is a certain problem that it might be, it's like an incredibly simple procedure.
[376:51.31]It's like having your tonsils taken out.
[376:53.43]Essentially.
[376:54.41]It's not a big deal at all.
[376:57.83]don't worry alright let's go six hours it's about 20 minutes over alright that's fine uh
[377:07.66]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the one dollar.
[377:09.14]I'm really enjoying this game so far.
[377:10.50]It's like a mix of Sleeping Dogs and Watch Dogs.
[377:13.04]If Watch Dogs was good.
[377:14.76]Actually, I don't even know if that game was good or bad.
[377:17.27]I didn't get to watch the whole stream because I had other things come up.
[377:20.29]But if I can, I'll watch the VOD later.
[377:23.07]I think they made the robots less silly to make the player feel a bit of a sympathy for them.
[377:27.81]Take care.
[377:30.04]Yeah, I know.
[377:30.62]I'm just being a dick.
[377:33.66]I'm just taking the piss.
[377:37.28]game's been fun uh Samuel shish thanks for the uh it's a 50 cent grit don't read this one thank you mostly lost thanks for the one dollar I will give you a hundred bucks if you show us the mirror selfies it's not gonna happen so thank you though uh grill master x barbecue thanks for the one dollar
[377:59.63]And they say, how dare you try defaming me in your last stream?
[378:02.73]But because of your provocation, I have no choice but to declare war.
[378:06.45]I'll have you know that I graduated at the top of my class in the grilling corp and have over 300 confirmed streams all about barbecue.
[378:13.15]I'll have you know that I do stream regularly and won't take your falsehoods sitting down.
[378:17.55]You didn't accept my grill down over Memorial Day.
[378:20.27]I'll take that as a mark of your defeat.
[378:32.55]He thinks he matters.
[378:36.57]God, anyways.
[378:39.07]I needed that one.
[378:43.79]Throw that fucking loser under the rug.
[378:46.25]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1, man.
[378:48.23]God, I really needed that one at the end.
[378:51.59]Whatever happened to privacy as a thousand people watch your stream?
[378:56.04]But I get what you mean.
[378:57.14]This is just a joke.
[378:58.48]I'm looking forward to the next stream.
[378:59.76]Now I must go.
[379:00.56]My cat needs me.
[379:02.14]Take care of your cat.
[379:04.18]Thank you, Dr. Cliff.
[379:07.76]Don't you laugh.
[379:10.86]For the people that weren't... Alright, here's the thing.
[379:12.90]For the people that weren't here last stream... There's some history here.
[379:22.77]You might have to look it up.
[379:26.40]Dragon Breath, thanks for the $1.
[379:28.14]What's up, Dragon Breath?
[379:28.92]Jerma, any news on the Blordau emotes coming?
[379:31.22]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[379:33.74]I actually just looked at a pass of the new emotes today.
[379:37.36]They look great, and they'll be coming soon.
[379:39.49]There's going to be a couple of slight changes to them, but they're awesome.
[379:45.05]There's going to be four new emotes coming in very soon, because they're pretty much done.
[379:56.19]Uh, you're getting antsy for the new emotes.
[379:57.75]Also, have you thought about doing a fan art section at the end of your streams?
[380:01.61]Vinny does a nice segment, but the end of these streams kind of already have this bit reading stuff, so it might seem like too much at the end.
[380:07.28]Your call.
[380:09.16]Um... Probably not, just because it takes a very long time for me to sludge through the bits, because I like to take time and talk about essentially every one.
[380:23.51]um but I would I would do something like that maybe like once a month maybe a couple times a year maybe because give people some time to make pieces but um we'll see it's not something I written off completely though uh bala sparkle thanks for the 50 fucking cents remember not to read these I know god damn it thank you bro luck for the one dollar
[380:48.29]Hey, Jerma985 here, laughing my ass off.
[380:50.31]Hey, do you guys ever wondered how much shit you pass through your toilet?
[380:58.77]Thank you, Samuel Sish, for the $1.50 to end it here.
[381:01.95]Didn't know you didn't read bits less than 100.
[381:04.59]Anyway, I'm back, baby.
