[00:02.37]How's everybody doing?
[00:05.23]Yes, I'm very early.
[00:06.53]There's a reason for that, though.
[00:10.83]You shouldn't go live if you are sick.
[00:15.67]I'm alright.
[00:16.13]This feels kind of terrible.
[00:20.64]Why are you live?
[00:21.44]Get out of here.
[00:21.92]Yeah, right.
[00:24.60]Leave.
[00:26.10]What if I just left?
[00:27.11]I was like, alright, fine, I'll go to bed.
[00:31.77]You sound awful.
[00:34.37]I just wanted to hang out for a few hours.
[00:36.37]Yeah, you haven't seen me in like five days.
[00:41.03]Well, I mean, well, hold on.
[00:41.90]When was Halloween?
[00:45.06]And those of you that didn't watch the Halloween stream on Charlie's stream, you haven't seen me in even longer.
[00:55.87]uh the reason why I'm early for those of you that don't know yesterday um I was in the pre-stream chat I typically am and I talked about how I didn't feel very well I was like oh shit I had all this fun stuff to do and it turned out I didn't feel very good
[01:17.24]So I was like, I got up today.
[01:19.16]I took a COVID test, by the way.
[01:20.14]It's not COVID.
[01:21.86]Or if it is, it's not detectable in a test yet.
[01:26.00]But I've been testing every, I want to say, 12 hours.
[01:30.26]It's not that, apparently.
[01:33.51]But it's something.
[01:35.29]It's annoying.
[01:35.71]I have a weak immune system.
[01:40.99]I actually have a pretty strong immune system.
[01:48.89]Go to bed.
[01:50.73]Well, okay, so I got up and I was contemplating if I was going to stream today.
[01:55.67]But, I mean, I pushed the stream yesterday to today.
[01:59.54]And I didn't want to do it again.
[02:00.50]Because I want to stream.
[02:02.20]I'm here.
[02:02.74]I want to stream.
[02:08.02]So we were going to play Neon White and Frog Detective, but I definitely can't do the Frog Detective voices.
[02:12.44]So we're going to play a cute dog game where you take pictures of dogs.
[02:19.21]I've actually had this in my Steam list for months.
[02:25.03]It's called paparazzi.
[02:30.91]Nice cheese voice.
[02:34.17]Wait, do you mean that's the milk voice?
[02:36.66]I know what you mean.
[02:40.42]Cheese voice.
[02:43.02]This is what you sound like when you eat like a block of cheddar.
[02:48.29]That's so gross.
[02:53.98]Uh, yeah, I'll take the whole milk, please.
[02:56.20]Oh, yeah.
[03:00.09]Yeah, I love whole milk.
[03:01.65]It's so good.
[03:02.29]Does anybody drink whole milk in here?
[03:18.00]Be honest with me.
[03:19.03]Do you drink whole milk?
[03:20.75]To me, whole milk is something you put... You mix with eggs.
[03:24.93]And you make food with it.
[03:26.27]Or, like, desserts.
[03:27.45]Nobody drinks whole milk, right?
[03:32.71]Only two-week-olds drink whole milk.
[03:36.31]It's better for you.
[03:37.42]I actually don't really like dairy milk at all anymore.
[03:46.62]It's crazy because after a while of drinking... I'm going to oat milk Chad, by the way.
[03:52.13]Are there any other oat milk Chads in here?
[03:54.07]I would hope so.
[04:02.44]Yeah, so oat milk...
[04:05.36]When you drink... I put it in my coffee usually or whatever.
[04:08.40]I put it in cereal.
[04:10.16]Going back to real dairy milk tastes like... I don't know.
[04:15.25]It tastes like blood.
[04:17.33]It's weird.
[04:17.93]It tastes like meat.
[04:19.87]Does anyone know what I'm talking about?
[04:22.51]Those of you that did a milk substitute for a long time went back to real milk.
[04:26.09]It tastes like you're drinking meat.
[04:32.82]It's very weird.
[04:38.74]Milk substitutes.
[04:40.48]I honestly, I used to like almond milk.
[04:43.98]But then I kind of read some articles of how like almonds are destroying California.
[04:50.83]And was like, uh, maybe I'll switch to something else.
[05:01.79]I was like, maybe I'll do oat milk.
[05:03.77]And then I tried soy milk.
[05:04.97]Soy milk sucks.
[05:07.62]Let's be very honest here.
[05:09.40]Soy milk is like... I don't know.
[05:11.98]I hate it.
[05:19.01]It's like rice milk, which is okay.
[05:20.71]That's fine.
[05:21.29]It's a little thin for me.
[05:22.97]And then I found oat milk.
[05:25.11]And it's got full of flavor.
[05:27.52]It's a little sweet.
[05:29.42]It's delicious.
[05:31.48]It's great stuff.
[05:35.34]If you wanted me to do a milk tier list, I would.
[05:37.38]And oat milk would be number one.
[05:39.22]S+.
[05:45.88]Are you for real?
[05:46.96]No, actually, you said, are you real?
[05:50.34]Yes.
[05:54.24]Are you for real?
[05:57.54]What did you say?
[05:57.99]Most people what?
[05:59.77]Oat milk is the reason why you're fucked up.
[06:01.33]That's not accurate.
[06:02.43]I started drinking oat milk like two years ago.
[06:05.15]But fucked up for a long time.
[06:08.43]How come there's no milk mode enabled in OBS?
[06:10.86]I don't know.
[06:16.58]Almond milk is really good.
[06:18.56]No, I like almond milk.
[06:21.92]Just almonds take so much to grow.
[06:24.11]And they take so much to harvest and stuff.
[06:27.47]I don't know.
[06:28.15]I've read some articles.
[06:31.39]But anyways, I'm not feeling great.
[06:33.49]But I didn't want to not stream because I wanted to hang out.
[06:35.28]It's been a while.
[06:36.52]So we're going to play paparazzi.
[06:39.12]Let's do it.

[07:23.52]Yeah, I've put the cheese plate away.
[07:25.24]Put the cheese plate away.
[07:26.20]No, I'm gonna finish it.
[07:27.24]Alright, so did I even do face cam today?
[07:33.04]Whatever, I'll be fine.
[07:37.10]I'm fine.
[07:37.36]Alright, this is paparazzi.
[07:43.63]Let's go.
[07:45.53]I'm actually kind of excited for this.
[07:46.59]This is gonna be a chill day.
[07:51.70]Yar, are you the new Popper's Razzo?
[07:54.27]It's about time we sea dogs had someone to photograph our adorable wee faces.
[08:00.71]Will you take a photo of me?
[08:07.48]I feel like I shouldn't be playing this game.
[08:09.90]I don't know, it just hit me like a brick.
[08:12.98]I don't know, it's freaking me out for some reason.
[08:14.96]Why?
[08:15.23]I don't know why this is freaking me out.
[08:20.98]This game's like cute, but I have to like settle down.
[08:23.09]Alright, hold on.
[08:25.03]Use the mouse to look around.
[08:27.93]Aim your camera with the right mouse button.
[08:29.41]Okay, take a photo with the left mouse button.
[08:35.99]There it is!
[08:36.51]Open your journal to view objectives.
[08:39.48]There's just dogs running around?
[08:40.98]Post to dog net.
[08:48.41]This is the kind of photo that gets, like, two thumbs up on DogNet.
[08:54.28]Mm-mm.
[08:56.30]I'm gonna do it anyway.
[08:56.96]I'm gonna do it.
[08:57.34]This photo is blowing my mind.
[09:01.26]I told you it was one person.
[09:03.36]It was literally one person.
[09:08.83]Raise this photo to recycle one film.
[09:10.77]If you have saved it in your favorites, you can view it later.
[09:13.03]Well, it's our first... Okay, it's our first one, so we have to save it.
[09:19.11]Okay.
[09:19.81]Get five followers to... Oh, you actually have to get people to... It's like Instagram.
[09:25.92]Alright.
[09:26.56]Alright, I'm ready.
[09:28.14]Can you take a photo of me?
[09:30.18]I'm the wee grey one in front of me shop.
[09:33.06]Be sure to crouch to catch me best angles.
[09:38.78]Okay.
[09:41.90]Where are you?
[09:42.94]I'm the wee grey one in front of me shop.
[09:47.50]Oh, there you are.
[09:52.90]What's that gonna get on DogNet?
[09:57.30]Hold shift.
[09:57.86]Okay, so I did that.
[10:00.94]Take a photo of Sea Dog.
[10:03.90]I always knew I was handsome.
[10:05.60]You can now pet dogs.
[10:06.90]Walk up to them and hold to interact.
[10:08.28]Oh shit.
[10:10.82]Really?
[10:11.10]That was a very long arm.
[10:19.52]Who is this?
[10:20.10]Is this my arm?
[10:20.98]This doesn't feel right.
[10:25.71]You can pet the dog.
[10:26.78]Okay, so now what?
[10:28.02]I only have 10 pictures I can take?
[10:29.28]Oh, cool.
[10:43.17]That one's going on dog net.
[10:49.39]That one's pretty good too.
[10:50.19]Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[10:51.74]Right there.
[10:52.78]Good.
[10:53.98]Over here.
[10:57.36]Where are all these dogs?
[10:58.36]Where are all the owners?
[10:59.34]Why are there just hundreds of dogs?
[11:03.26]Is this like a dog town?
[11:04.84]Wait, that's not safe.
[11:10.14]They live here.
[11:12.20]Am I a dog?
[11:12.84]Click.
[11:20.83]That one's going in the cringe compilation.
[11:24.97]Okay.
[11:26.19]So...
[11:29.22]Can I do, like, a selfie?
[11:31.38]I need five followers.
[11:37.24]You got two new followers.
[11:40.26]Take a photo of a friendly dog.
[11:42.54]What's going on here?
[11:43.34]Okay.
[11:46.70]Perfect promo material for the shop.
[11:48.02]Oh, I can rotate the camera now.
[11:52.36]You have to, Lala.
[11:53.25]I will.
[11:55.07]Dude, you kind of look like a bull terrier.
[11:59.26]The bull terrier is the one with the... Ooh, that was an ugly sound that I just made.
[12:03.61]Bull terriers are the big, chunky snouts, right?
[12:06.69]I look like a bull terrier?
[12:09.73]Do I?
[12:11.99]It's the target dog.
[12:13.01]Oh.
[12:14.70]Alright, I need five followers.
[12:16.42]I only have two followers right now.
[12:19.20]Can you send me a photo of a dog playing with a stick?
[12:22.90]Okay.
[12:25.14]I love to see my friends play around.
[12:26.46]I can do that.
[12:26.92]Easy.
[12:29.18]And there's a stick right here.
[12:30.12]Alright, who should play with it?
[12:40.05]That's a good one.
[12:44.21]That one's even better.
[12:45.91]Yep.
[12:46.59]Oh, your eyes are closed.
[12:47.35]Hold on.
[12:50.25]Look at that one.
[12:51.03]That one's perfect.
[12:52.33]Okay.
[12:54.17]Yep.
[12:56.21]Oh my god, so cute.
[12:57.63]You got three bunks.
[12:59.21]Use cash to buy items in the shop.
[13:00.93]Alright.
[13:03.75]Alright, which one should go on dog net?
[13:06.31]This one for sure.
[13:08.22]Now this is a good dog.
[13:09.72]Spam?
[13:11.54]Am I spamming people?
[13:20.06]I have six followers.
[13:21.00]Oh, you can't see that.
[13:21.66]Hold on.
[13:23.10]Where should I put the camera?
[13:29.25]I hate doing this because I have to flip it.
[13:32.73]This is a cute game.
[13:38.14]This game's cute.
[13:43.65]Oh my god, he loves you.
[13:44.71]Yes, okay.
[13:46.15]I spam if I do it too much.
[13:47.41]Ahem.
[13:52.26]Alright, that's good.
[13:53.06]So now, what do you need now?
[13:55.45]Five followers.
[13:56.19]I get access to the shop.
[13:57.89]Find a vending machine to use it.
[13:59.17]All objectives here are complete.
[14:01.21]You can leave the area and check back later.

[14:18.91]Sounds good.
[14:22.00]Golden dog bone.
[14:25.24]Don't go into the water.
[14:34.00]What are they looking at?
[14:38.20]I love this dog.
[14:39.10]Look at him.
[14:39.70]Watch out.
[14:40.00]Watch out.
[14:49.12]Unflip it.
[14:50.04]I'm not, why?
[14:51.24]No, I have to be looking to where the gameplay is.
[14:53.38]That's streamer 101.
[14:54.32]Okay, so now, um, camera.
[15:03.33]Ooh, I can get a zoom lens.
[15:04.51]Okay, I have to go to a vending machine.
[15:14.00]Sea dogs.
[15:17.78]There, okay, here's one here.
[15:22.54]This is what would be inside of a dog vending machine, right?
[15:26.68]Oh, okay.
[15:30.22]Film pack.
[15:32.69]Black and white film pack?
[15:34.27]Stylish film pack or fisheye lens?
[15:41.69]Stylish film pack?
[15:44.55]I don't have enough of the fisheye lens.
[15:47.29]I'll get the black and white now.
[15:48.25]Because I think I have to do it for the tutorial.
[15:58.03]Basic color, basic black and white.
[16:00.55]Black and white filtered.
[16:04.86]This looks cool.
[16:05.60]Hold on.
[16:09.70]Now that's actually kind of an artsy photo.
[16:13.66]Look at that one.
[16:19.09]Yep.
[16:19.95]Dog net.
[16:22.23]Take a closer look.
[16:23.29]Zoom.
[16:24.71]Give me some of that food.
[16:29.30]This one's... I'm going to the favorites.
[16:30.62]Alright, just get rid of these.
[16:37.12]I'm not going to, like, lose followers, right?
[16:39.10]Can you lose followers?
[16:47.25]Okay.
[16:49.29]So now, uh... Leave the area and check back later.
[16:52.13]Alright, so I'm going to leave.
[16:58.18]How do I get out of here?
[17:02.61]You're gonna lose him.
[17:10.53]Oh, sitting completely still.
[17:11.93]That was almost a perfect photo.
[17:13.01]Turn around.
[17:14.61]How do I turn around?
[17:16.43]No!
[17:18.56]Sorry.
[17:21.00]Alright, how do I get out of here?
[17:23.60]This way?
[17:28.04]Golden dog bone.
[17:29.16]Sick.
[17:36.45]How do you fix the stream?
[17:37.25]He looks weird.
[17:47.55]Eat a dog treat now.
[17:53.62]Eat a dog treat now.
[17:58.30]People don't like it.
[17:59.08]It's a dog.
[18:01.36]Plus one.
[18:04.04]Apparently I'm spamming DogNet.
[18:10.98]Oh, leave area, okay.
[18:11.96]SCORN.
[18:13.44]What is going on here?
[18:15.60]Wait, what?
[18:16.42]Home?
[18:36.34]Oh, it shows the different dogs in the photos.
[18:39.17]Oh, that's cool.
[18:40.83]Okay.
[18:45.51]Lighthouse Cove.
[18:47.21]Go.
[18:51.29]Are you the pupper Rotzer?
[18:53.70]On behalf of the Doggo Documentation Project, we need your help.
[18:59.20]Someone in our record-keeping department got distracted by a tennis ball and accidentally deleted everything.
[19:04.21]Now I need someone to photograph all the different kinds of dogs for science.
[19:07.55]These photos will be added to our state-of-the-art Puppypedia system.
[19:11.33]Anytime you find something new, you can view the Puppypedia from the home button.
[19:14.99]Alright.
[19:21.09]How do I get out of here, though?
[19:29.78]Find this request hidden somewhere in the area.
[19:33.63]How do I get out of here?
[19:35.81]Is there an envelope in the shop?
[19:43.28]You can't go back.
[19:45.24]I can't go back.
[19:46.58]Go to the sea, dogs.
[19:47.72]Oh, shit.
[19:49.66]Okay, I got it.
[20:01.81]I need swashbuckling spirit.
[20:03.29]Give me a photo of a dog on a boat.
[20:05.29]Take it from below.
[20:06.13]That counts, right?
[20:30.93]Oh, you can submit a photo to the exhibition.
[20:33.83]Okay, a dog and a sailboat taken from below.
[20:35.83]Didn't I just do that?
[20:37.77]That's it, right?
[20:46.34]Too close?
[20:59.17]Okay, there's that.
[21:00.43]Thank you.
[21:00.79]The boardwalk is now open.
[21:02.37]Alright, cool.
[21:03.46]Let's go.
[21:10.34]You know you can save photos that you really like?
[21:15.24]Show me the best photo that you've taken so far.
[21:17.23]Probably this one.
[21:26.70]Let's go to the boardwalk.
[21:28.54]These pictures suck.
[21:30.52]I just started.
[21:36.37]Where's Frog Detective 3?
[21:37.59]Frog Detective 3 got bumped.
[21:40.93]Because I'm kind of sick.
[21:44.17]And I wouldn't be able to do all the voices.
[21:45.85]And when I talk loud, my head hurts.
[21:47.59]Stop asking questions.
[21:52.05]It makes me talk and it makes my head hurt.
[21:55.63]Okay, um, where's this boardwalk?
[22:01.26]Down here, right?
[22:03.42]He's dying.
[22:04.32]Puppy boardwalk.
[22:10.85]Let's go.
[22:14.45]Okay.
[22:17.31]I'm the king of all dogs.
[22:18.81]Your paparazzi programming appears to present potential.
[22:21.73]If you can gain more followers, you may yet impress me.
[22:24.81]What even was that?
[22:25.47]Is that a dog?
[22:27.61]Are there people here?
[22:44.55]Eggnog voice.
[22:50.89]By the way, eggnog is fucking disgusting.
[22:54.81]I can't think of a more disgusting beverage than eggnog.
[23:01.39]Oh, shit.
[23:02.03]Alright, I'm fine.
[23:07.59]You know what?
[23:08.01]Eggnog tastes like raw cookie batter.
[23:11.05]It says something about it tastes raw.
[23:13.39]Like, I shouldn't be drinking it.
[23:15.00]It's like, oh, yeah, and this is a bunch of raw eggs and a bunch of, like, raw.
[23:18.98]This tastes raw.

[27:09.38]Alright.
[27:11.22]Look, I know it doesn't sound very safe, but the scooters the dogs ride have a ton of safety features.
[27:16.09]Those poor arcade games are trapped in the closed arcade.
[27:20.35]Sneak in there and take a photo of an arcade machine?
[27:22.19]Alright, let's go.
[27:23.31]Alright, and a dog with a scooter?
[27:33.08]That's just... Now this is just... This is just abnormal.
[27:37.36]A dog selling yogurt out of a food truck?
[27:40.12]Now, that's not... That doesn't happen that way.
[27:43.09]That doesn't happen that way.
[27:44.25]I'm out of film.

[28:19.79]Film shuffler.
[28:20.47]Should I just do the shuffler?
[28:25.38]Yeah.
[28:25.66]And then I'm going to post this on Facebook.
[28:27.54]It's going to be like, new CEO with like two crying, laughing faces.
[28:37.32]That's my truck, by the way.
[28:38.74]Like, that's my business.
[28:43.10]Like, I own me.
[28:44.60]I own the frog yogurt business.
[28:46.36]And like, I take this photo and I say, new CEO.
[28:56.39]Oh, wait, you're on a scooter.
[28:58.07]Be careful.
[29:07.94]I wanna get you riding.
[29:08.90]Nope, not good enough.
[29:20.64]Close, maybe.
[29:21.58]Fucking influencer dog.
[29:30.13]Alright, here we go.
[29:40.07]I wanted you to be crossing the plane of the camera.
[29:47.63]Fuck.
[29:50.60]Turn around and go this way.
[29:59.36]That's the one.
[30:00.72]There it is.
[30:01.14]Got it.
[30:04.68]Yep.
[30:05.21]Perfect one.
[30:09.78]20 that was a lot of followers and I got three bugs I can take a selfie with the dogs you love you love thirds lower thirds you love thirds rule of thirds I do I'm such a sucker for the rule of thirds I swear to god I am I'm such a sucker
[30:33.77]Alright, so people that don't know what the fuck anyone's talking about here.
[30:37.46]The rule of thirds, rule of thirds, Andy.
[30:39.54]That's fine.
[30:40.06]It fucking looks great.
[30:42.00]Rule of thirds means paint a grid in this square, right?
[30:47.42]It's two lines down, two lines horizontal.
[30:50.29]And what you're doing is you're essentially matching where the cross points are.
[30:56.47]So for instance, you know, that looks like shit.
[31:00.39]You know what I mean?
[31:01.31]But this...
[31:03.45]Looks fucking great.
[31:05.71]That looks cool.
[31:08.23]I love rule of thirds.
[31:11.31]Straight on camera pictures.
[31:13.31]What are you, a fucking amateur?
[31:17.96]I wouldn't want to do this, right?
[31:20.06]I want to get you in the bottom left third and you in the top left third.
[31:23.60]Thank you very much.
[31:24.44]That is a great photo.
[31:25.76]This photo looks like absolute dog shit.
[31:29.26]This photo is a fucking award winner.
[31:32.51]This photo, again, terrible.
[31:34.81]This photo, award-winning.
[31:39.55]Sorry I swore in front of you.
[31:41.67]I'm sorry, YouTube.
[31:46.45]You should let your followers decide what's better.
[31:49.97]And rule of thirds works for other stuff too, for instance, right?
[31:53.96]You might think... What an amateur.
[31:56.78]You might think that I'm trying to take a picture of these dogs.
[31:59.58]And I am.
[32:00.54]And I am.
[32:01.36]But you notice what's in the... What is in the rule of thirds right now?
[32:05.68]What is it?
[32:08.90]What am I taking a photo of to make sure that this comes together well?
[32:13.37]If you said the light posts, you would be correct.
[32:16.37]And I'm talking both light posts.
[32:18.51]I'm talking about the one on the right as well.
[32:21.25]And the pier goes out on the bottom, lines it up in the top left.
[32:27.88]So I've got pictures of dogs in this photo, but I also have a really well juxtaposed photo.
[32:32.60]See this photo, like this.
[32:35.50]Oh my god, delete it.
[32:38.25]That one you can put as a profile picture.
[32:44.25]You explained that better than my photography class did.
[32:48.63]Well, all I said was, like, that's dog shit.
[32:54.02]I don't think, like, a professional, um, like, photo class is gonna be like, take your photo like this is dog shit.
[33:00.88]Like, this is good.
[33:03.10]I feel like that would, you probably wouldn't do that.
[33:05.97]Let's get a good landscape.
[33:06.95]That sounds good to me.
[33:07.89]Let's go ahead and take a look.
[33:10.25]And I want you guys to tell me, is this a dog shit photo or is this a beautiful photo?
[33:15.22]And I want you, I'm not going to tell you which one it is.
[33:19.52]I am going to take a picture of the, of the boardwalk and the buildings and the buildings, right?
[33:25.65]That's what I'm trying to get.
[33:41.27]That was dog shit, you're right.
[33:42.21]How about now?
[33:58.42]It's not- Oh!
[33:59.50]Oh, okay.
[34:00.20]Alright, you guys are good.
[34:05.00]Better.
[34:06.04]Still dog shit.
[34:14.63]How about this picture?
[34:18.38]I just missed a huge opportunity to take a cool photo.
[34:22.94]Dog shit?
[34:26.00]How about now?
[34:28.38]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[34:29.30]I have to delete some stuff.
[34:36.87]How was that photo?
[34:39.51]How was this picture?
[34:45.94]Actually, not great.
[34:48.04]It was okay.
[34:48.96]But this is the subject here.
[34:50.52]I'm going to show you something else too.
[35:02.21]So remember, the subject is... This is the subject here on the right.
[35:10.77]Look at that.
[35:12.15]Look at these.
[35:12.51]Look at that.
[35:14.35]Look at these.
[35:17.74]I spammed.
[35:31.25]I need to stop moving.
[35:34.49]That's not my fault.
[35:51.35]Now that's just cute.
[35:54.39]So also, remember, what's going on with this bench?
[35:59.36]Can anybody tell me what's going on with the bench?
[36:10.47]Can somebody tell me why I'm filming it like this?
[36:12.53]Somebody tell me why I'm doing it like that?
[36:14.73]Because the bench is the subject.
[36:21.06]Bench, the corners are lining up with the thirds.
[36:25.87]Like this.
[36:26.27]Ugh.
[36:27.33]No, that looks terrible.
[36:32.03]I don't f- Why are you following my account if you don't want pictures of dogs?
[36:36.39]Oh, you're spamming me.
[36:37.74]You signed up to my dog- You're on DogNet right now.
[36:40.54]You're on DogNet.
[36:42.74]Who goes to DogNet and gets annoyed at too many dog photos?
[36:48.33]See, look at this one.
[36:49.83]This one just speaks so many things.
[36:57.89]I don't fucking care if I'm spamming you.
[37:05.96]Jeremiah Hawley took all the sunflower photos for you.
[37:08.64]Don't act like you know anything about photography.
[37:16.44]I was there, like, directing.
[37:19.05]I was there directing.
[37:26.57]I was directing.
[37:34.06]Dude, your dog net and your Twitter are complete opposites.
[37:42.09]Why?
[37:42.51]Because... Don't wake the dog.
[37:46.77]Oh my god, you're so cool!
[37:49.09]Hold on.
[37:52.75]Do I have any new bangers for you guys?
[37:55.61]Let's see.
[37:55.97]Let me find out if I have any new bangers for you guys that I've saved.
[37:58.89]What the fuck?
[38:12.04]Okay, I gotta talk about this.
[38:14.98]But first of all...
[38:16.79]I don't know why I wrote this.
[38:17.89]Okay, this is a draft.
[38:18.95]This is the latest draft.
[38:22.62]Hey, I want to try something.
[38:24.44]Can everyone at exactly 3 p.m.
[38:27.12]Pacific time Monday all collectively pray for me and send positive thoughts to me?
[38:33.26]I want to see if I feel good or something when it happens.
[38:37.55]You know what I mean?
[38:38.85]Like, everybody at exactly 3 p.m.
[38:43.03]It's just, like, everyone just, like, prays and, like, says, like, oh, my God, like, Jerma, like, we all, like, love you.
[38:48.23]And, like, I want to see if I, like, feel alright.
[38:49.83]You know what I mean?
[38:50.29]Like, I'm just going to sit there and be like.
[38:54.07]Like, do I feel any different?
[38:55.95]I wonder if, like, I feel, like, cool.
[38:58.33]I imagine, like, a cool feeling.
[39:05.84]It's not an ego thing, I swear to God.
[39:07.70]I was just curious if, like, we got, like, 50,000 people all to, like, just in their rooms, just sit there and, like, just think, like, a positive thing to me.
[39:16.54]Like, would I feel, what would happen?
[39:19.98]No, not a cult leader, stop it.
[39:23.06]No.
[39:24.44]I'm just saying, like, if everybody all collectively did it, would I feel any different for, like, a minute?
[39:39.72]What a narcissist.
[39:40.68]No, you're missing the point.
[39:42.88]The point is, I don't care if you actually believe this stuff.
[39:46.25]I just want to see, like, if, like, I don't know, would I see, like, a dove?
[39:51.73]Would, like, a bird fly by?
[39:54.87]I don't know.
[39:57.43]Everyone pray to me.
[40:04.43]Like not pray, pray is the wrong word.
[40:07.11]The word I'm looking for is like, like send like positive, like messages in your head.
[40:13.09]Like towards me.
[40:14.29]A spirit bomb?
[40:21.48]Good manifest, good vibes.
[40:23.50]Yes, that's what I mean.
[40:24.76]Not pray to me like I'm a fucking idol.
[40:31.55]I got to tell you this story because it's fucking crazy.
[40:34.27]So at the airport, I came when I was, if you didn't know, I was on Charlie's stream.
[40:40.55]I was out on the East Coast hanging out with Charlie.
[40:43.84]It was fun.
[40:44.26]It was awesome.
[40:46.20]Those guys are all incredible.
[40:47.68]Definitely going to be doing some more shit with that group because they're so fun.
[40:50.68]They're so funny.
[40:51.82]And they're awesome to be around.
[40:53.98]But, so, I got home, right?
[40:57.87]So, as I get home, and I'm at the airport, and I have to get into an elevator.
[41:03.87]Oh yeah, I've got my diploma, I'm in Vegas, I gotta get in the elevator, right?
[41:09.27]So, this elevator is... A lot of people use this elevator in the Vegas airport.
[41:16.26]And it goes up and down, it only goes one floor.
[41:19.22]And I have my bag.
[41:22.38]And I'm dragging my... No, no, no, that's wrong.
[41:24.82]I had a backpack.
[41:25.70]So I had a backpack on, didn't have very much luggage, so I was just walking around.
[41:28.18]No, this is not a bit.
[41:29.62]So I have to get in this elevator, and I see there are people already in the elevator.
[41:34.02]And it's like, okay, I'm walking.
[41:36.08]I'm far enough away where I could probably make it.
[41:38.83]The doors are open.
[41:39.65]There's only a few people in there, and they start to close.
[41:43.31]And you know when somebody's coming, right?
[41:46.45]Usually you're like, oh, you put your arm out or something.
[41:48.19]Oh, that person's there.
[41:49.15]But they couldn't see me.
[41:51.05]These people could not see me.
[41:53.37]So... Usually you've kind of... Oh, hold it for the person that you see coming because they're going to get into.
[41:59.01]So I'm walking.
[42:00.11]Nobody's doing that because nobody can see me.
[42:02.52]And I just am like, I think I can make this.
[42:04.22]The doors are closing.
[42:05.82]And as I walk, I perfectly... I have no fucking idea how this happened.
[42:11.26]I have never done this before.
[42:13.48]As I'm walking, I get in right when the doors are in the exact micrometer...
[42:21.13]of space for me to get in and get crushed by the doors.
[42:25.35]I got fucking smushed.
[42:27.65]I just walked in, and I was like, I can make it, I can make it.
[42:31.61]And I went, ow!
[42:32.91]And both the doors went like, on my shoulders.
[42:36.51]And it was like, and then, honestly, I would have laughed, right?
[42:43.09]Nobody's laughing.
[42:45.53]So they're just kind of looking at me like, oh shit.
[42:48.21]And I was like, oh, I said something.
[42:50.88]I was, I don't know what the fuck did I say?
[42:52.30]I said like, oh, I gotta be careful with these doors.
[42:55.52]I don't know.
[42:55.84]I said something like fucking stupid because it was embarrassing.
[42:58.50]And then, so the doors start to close and that's done with.
[43:02.98]And then I hear, oh, you have room for one more?
[43:05.36]And I'm like,
[43:07.74]Yeah.
[43:08.62]And the dude, the door is closing again.
[43:10.59]And again, I get my hand in there right when it is in the worst possible time.
[43:16.85]The doors are closed.
[43:18.46]It was like, like closing on my hand.
[43:22.12]And it was like, oh shit, the doors will open again.
[43:25.04]And like, I should have just let it close.
[43:27.66]But like, I don't know.
[43:28.48]I like, I wanted to let this guy in.
[43:31.43]And this guy had a bunch of stuff.
[43:34.13]And I think the people that were in the elevator with me were just like, like this motherfucker, I swear to God, dude, just like this, it goes one floor.
[43:42.97]It'll be back.
[43:45.76]so he the guy rolls in all of his stuff and I think I I don't know I was trying to be like oh I'm like a weirdo like oh hey like and I think I said like be careful those doors again and then I kind of was like like and I'll tell you right now I was the first person out of that fucking elevator I was the first person out the elevator opened and I was just gone like just like have a good night
[44:12.46]Yeah, the guy had like at least four or five bags that he kept bringing in.
[44:20.30]But I just imagine, imagine you sit there in an elevator and you're just, you've been traveling.
[44:26.70]And just somebody just as the elevator's closing, walks in and gets perfectly to the, to like the millimeter, directly walking into the doorway right when it crushes both of his shoulders.
[44:37.95]And he goes like, ow!
[44:41.86]That would live in my head forever.
[44:43.10]I would think I would laugh at that every day.
[44:47.36]I would laugh at that every single day, I think.
[44:49.33]In the shower, it would just pop in.
[44:55.73]But anyways, any more tweets?
[44:56.99]I actually wrote it.
[45:04.50]I said, walking into an... This is a tweet.
[45:06.62]Walking into elevator, I got crushed like a cartoon sideways.
[45:10.53]Period.
[45:11.59]Audible ow.
[45:12.45]Okay.
[45:18.63]I don't know why I wrote this.
[45:23.85]Watching TV in my hotel room, I just saw two different lactative commercials for two completely different products in a row, followed by a fried chicken commercial.
[45:34.00]What the fuck?
[45:35.52]That's true.
[45:36.14]That was fucking weird.
[45:38.00]I was like, what the fuck is going on?
[45:48.79]Release your tweets.
[45:51.30]No, these tweets are for me.
[46:01.84]This is a fucking really good one here.
[46:04.78]And I mean it is like one of the best.
[46:07.78]And I'm going to post it.
[46:09.56]I'm not going to read that one.
[46:10.60]That one's too good to read.
[46:12.28]That one's going up.
[46:13.72]Eventually.
[46:14.70]It's like the best tweet I've ever written.
[46:16.67]And you're not going to hear it until it's there.
[46:20.19]I use it like a diary, yeah.
[46:26.95]No, I'm not going to tell you.
[46:27.79]I'm not posting it now either.
[46:28.73]It's very specific.
[46:31.47]No, I'm not releasing them.
[46:32.27]No.
[46:32.57]Alright.
[46:33.01]What was I doing?
[46:33.45]I just gave myself like a bad headache.
[46:36.19]Fuck.
[46:38.99]I was supposed to chill today.
[46:40.28]But it was so... I had to hear about it.
[46:41.66]It was so funny.
[46:45.06]I can't post it.
[46:45.84]Alright.
[46:49.82]I gotta... Let's slow down.
[46:50.62]I have to help clean up the skate park.
[46:58.19]See what you can do about the trash.
[46:59.33]There should be dumpsters around.
[47:00.37]Then send me a photo.
[47:01.21]I want to take a picture of this.
[47:11.07]Take it easy, man.
[47:15.49]Oh, I like that one.
[47:21.61]Oh, my God.

[49:36.41]Is it fish eye on?
[49:44.40]Well, this is not extreme fish eye.
[49:51.14]Okay, I need to... Clean up the skate park.
[49:54.26]I only need one more follower and I'm a fucking millionaire, whatever it is.
[49:57.86]Click on the truck.

[50:13.60]You want this?
[50:17.43]Oh, it has a face.
[50:21.56]Look over here.
[50:22.72]Look this way.
[50:23.24]How to survive a falling elevator.
[50:28.82]It's me.
[50:32.12]It's me.
[50:57.51]You know, it's so funny about the green screen stuff and I'm actually very happy about this Like when you're looking for just like just royalty-free shit Actually be kind of hard.
[51:10.33]It could be kind of annoying So I'm actually kind of happy that like people can use it whether it's like a corporate video or any like project whatever like those those green screen pieces of footage
[51:24.39]You could just use them, right?
[51:26.45]I'm not going to sue you.
[51:27.79]I'm just telling you, right?
[51:29.81]That's actually, I like seeing that.
[51:31.33]That's funny.
[51:32.19]That's really funny, though.
[51:37.40]Show it?
[51:37.76]Okay, well, hold on.
[51:45.48]It's like me jumping.
[51:49.34]Hold on, let me put this in here.
[52:02.00]He's against question three.
[52:03.76]So is she.
[52:05.76]And labor unions too.
[52:11.20]Crime is skyrocketing.
[52:19.33]Okay, let me put this on.
[52:29.49]Here's the only...
[52:39.69]only way to survive a falling elevator most people think you should jump right that's what I thought you hit the ground however it'll be difficult to jump while you're falling and secondly if you're falling at a speed of 50 miles per hour and you jump five miles per hour into the air you're still gonna hit the ground at 45 miles per hour now instead of jumping you should just lie flat on your back
[53:03.68]this way the impact is spread equally throughout your whole body but just remember with today's modern safety features your chances of dying are about one in ten million that I love that jump too it's like that's that's a very extreme jump however it'll be difficult people wouldn't jump like this the jump while however it'll be difficult however it'll be difficult
[53:35.61]I love it.
[53:35.99]No, that's what I mean though.
[53:37.09]I it's that's I like that Getting like royalty-free shit is like it's just so it's a it's a pain in the ass There's apparently more in that video Okay, that's cool Hey educational too
[54:12.62]just yeah would you can I just spam this oh yeah smart alright I'm gonna bring uh this one this is probably pineapple oh my god I want it to look so bad oh my god when we were at Disney probably ate seven of these
[54:39.61]I want it so bad.
[54:41.29]Alright, wait.
[54:42.25]I want the yogurt.
[54:45.82]Wait, tennis ball.

[55:09.29]It's pineapple soft serve.
[55:10.35]It's just nobody does it.
[55:14.35]It's pineapple ice cream.
[55:15.97]Pineapple soft serve.
[55:19.10]Why is it only at fucking Disney?
[55:22.46]Yuck.
[55:23.40]Ban that person.

[55:43.55]Alright, fine.
[55:46.18]I'm going to leave the area.
[55:48.68]Wait, I need to save the photos.
[55:52.34]Some of these are really good.
[55:53.12]I don't want to get rid of... Oh, yeah.
[55:54.34]Some of these are going to be huge on DogNet.
[56:03.93]Okay.
[56:04.05]Okay.
[56:08.45]mango dough yeah that one's good too alright some of these would be big what about what's the shop alright what's the best Disney ride I'm gonna tell you right now I actually don't even care about the rides
[56:35.78]I'm going to give you a tip, a Disney and any theme park tip, really, especially like a Disney place.
[56:42.94]I just kind of like looking at stuff.
[56:44.98]I like going to the shops and eating the food and walking around and looking at all the statues and stuff.
[56:56.39]The rides, they're good.
[56:57.77]I mean, Pirates of the Caribbean ride is pretty, pretty pog, right?
[57:00.99]At least at Disneyland.
[57:03.65]but I don't know I don't sitting in a line and usually waiting sometimes like an hour to get on the ride I I've just I'm so I just hate it yeah I'd rather just be an npc no that that's fair it is no you're that's right I'd rather just be an npc
[57:37.11]Disney loves Jerma customers.
[57:39.71]Wait, this is weird.
[57:43.35]Hold on.
[57:53.37]Jesus.
[57:58.92]That was a good one.
[57:59.46]I actually think this one's going to be... This one's going to go really hard on DogNet.
[58:03.22]Of course it is.
[58:04.58]Got it.
[58:05.74]30 followers.
[58:06.71]Wait, what?
[58:09.11]I heard there's some killer waves.
[58:12.59]Oh, it's a new day, so it's... Okay.
[58:14.09]Let's go to the port bar.
[58:20.69]No, I... Okay, so here's my reasoning.
[58:24.23]When you walk around and you look at how long some of these rides take to get on...
[58:29.79]Oh, the Haunted Mansion.
[58:32.54]80 minutes.
[58:33.98]Pirates of the Caribbean.
[58:35.58]40 to 50 minutes.
[58:36.96]Oh, this ride's about 40 minutes to wait.
[58:39.30]And the rides are two to four minutes long.
[58:43.08]You are deleting sometimes four plus to five plus hours per day waiting in line.
[58:52.61]I would rather pick... What are you doing?
[58:59.29]Hmm?
[58:59.81]I can't read this.
[59:01.69]What's your favorite topping for mac and cheese?
[59:03.07]I ask because I'm preparing my 45th birthday party and it's going to be Jerma themed and I want to serve mac and cheese.
[59:07.39]I want to make sure it's germtastic enough for my guests to enjoy.
[59:11.38]Alright, I have all the decorations ready.
[59:13.12]They're all your face and this is like a blocked word.
[59:16.70]This literally is like a deleted word.
[59:20.24]I don't know what it says.
[59:21.42]I'm also giving out little plush dachshunds.
[59:24.34]They're auto.
[59:24.88]We're going to watch every Jerma rumble in the dollhouse stream.
[59:28.39]Breadcrumbs.
[59:34.32]breadcrumbs it's easy anything else is weird breadcrumbs boring oh it said butthole anyways um so here's my here's my reasoning for this I would rather pick one or two things that I want to do
[59:59.58]and go do it they introduced this new thing and I am sorry but it sucks it's like the genie plus it's the new fast pass but it's just like a confusing fucking mess I I do just like what the fuck is this so I don't know I don't think we even used it
[60:24.74]It was just like, oh, you have to decide what ride you want to go on when you get there, and you have to be in the park, and then plan your day.
[60:33.22]You plan your day around the Genie Plus, and I don't... What the fuck are you talking about?
[60:40.84]But, so waiting in line for rides, you pick the one or two per day that you want to do, and you eat six Dole Whips and puke when you get back to the fucking hotel room.
[60:53.11]And walk around and look at all the stuff.
[60:56.08]Don't actually eat six Dole Whips.
[61:01.58]Okay, I'm going to tell you.
[61:03.48]Holly, you were in the chat, Holly.
[61:07.47]Was it three?
[61:09.13]How many?
[61:09.39]That night that we were there.
[61:11.73]Did I have two or three?
[61:16.43]Was it three Dole Whips over the course of like four or five hours?
[61:23.87]How many did I eat?
[61:26.95]Oh, you also helped eat mine too.
[61:28.23]So that's three and a half.
[61:31.19]Four.
[61:36.74]Yeah, and guess what?
[61:37.38]It was great.
[61:38.18]Walked around, ate Dole Whip and looked at all the shops and was an NPC for a little while.
[61:48.35]Rode Pirates of the Caribbean.
[61:49.69]And... Alright, something about Disneyland that you guys... This is fucking hilarious.
[61:55.37]So, the Winnie the Pooh ride at Disneyland... Is always a zero minute wait.
[62:00.61]Always.
[62:01.45]Zero.
[62:02.63]Zero.
[62:04.51]It's... You can just go on it whenever you want.
[62:06.43]It is the shittiest ride at the park.
[62:11.63]But it's... Who cares?
[62:12.65]I rode that...
[62:18.16]It's not even that bad either.
[62:19.22]Okay, what do we got?
[62:23.06]Got the surfing dog.
[62:27.27]How do I sneak into the arcade?
[62:38.32]Also, like, in line for the Winnie the Pooh ride, I remember just being, like, just being Holly.
[62:44.58]Just being like, oh, hey, ma'am.
[62:45.64]So, yeah, I'm glad we got into this line.
[62:47.38]Yeah, it's good that we used the Genie Plus on this.
[62:49.92]Like, this is always swarmed.
[62:51.56]Just, like, saying it.
[62:57.16]You just, like, can feel the eye rolls.
[62:58.92]Alright, let me play the game.
[63:08.20]Alright, old arcade.
[63:11.82]Oh my god, Disneyland also has these cream cheese filled pretzels.
[63:14.87]Holy shit.
[63:15.79]I don't want to tell anybody about this.
[63:18.61]I don't want to tell anybody because then you'll all go get it and I won't be able to get it anymore.
[63:21.77]Yeah, there's like one place.
[63:26.79]Okay.
[63:27.62]There's one place in Disneyland and they move it around.
[63:30.76]It's a secret.
[63:31.76]Fuck, I just told you the secret.
[63:32.82]I'm an idiot.
[63:33.24]Okay.
[63:35.73]This is actually like a Disneyland secret.
[63:37.37]And I just fucking told it to you.
[63:38.33]And I feel like an idiot now.
[63:39.37]Cause like now the line's gonna be long.
[63:43.60]They have a cream cheese filled pretzel and it's literally one of the best things I've ever eaten in my entire life.
[63:50.52]And I don't even know where it is.
[63:55.54]Because they change where it is every single day.
[63:58.79]The cream cheese Mickey Mouse pretzels are the best thing in the world.
[64:01.05]Yeah.
[64:02.07]And... Great.
[64:04.07]Now we're gonna go back to Disneyland, and that line's gonna be an hour fucking long, and they're all gonna be sitting there talking about each other, talking to each other.
[64:11.31]Oh, man, you know this is a secret?
[64:12.69]Don't tell anybody this.
[64:13.55]It's like, I... I fucking told you.
[64:18.48]Ow.
[64:24.10]How do I get into the arcade?
[64:25.18]Ahem.
[64:31.31]Around the back.
[64:36.09]Sneak into the arcade.
[64:39.65]How do I get in here?
[64:46.55]Yeah, I go to Disney for the food.
[64:53.91]That's so funny.
[64:55.05]I'm really the guy in rollercoaster tycoon that walks in, pays the, and you make the fee to get in expensive.
[65:02.50]I'm the one that walks in, has a bunch of money in my pocket.
[65:05.98]I walk around, buy a pretzel and leave.
[65:24.79]Oh, good.
[65:25.99]How'd you get up here?
[65:31.70]Ooh!
[65:38.15]This is the... What the fuck?
[65:42.21]How do I get into the arcade?
[65:50.67]Yeah, cream cheese pretzel is one of the best things at Disney.
[65:55.13]Without a doubt.
[66:01.23]How do I get in here?
[66:03.39]No help.
[66:04.97]I figured it would have been on the roof.
[66:07.49]I do have to get that, so I'm going to go back up there.
[66:17.71]That's a double jump in this game.
[66:18.89]That's kind of insane.
[66:19.63]Alright, arcade.
[66:21.73]So, come on.
[66:22.29]There's got to be a way to get in here.
[66:29.91]Right?
[66:30.81]What about, like, back here?
[66:35.53]I don't know.
[66:43.71]If I saw somebody do that on the boardwalk, I would fucking freak out.
[66:47.96]Okay.
[66:50.64]Sports and dogs.
[66:51.72]What's not to love?
[66:52.48]I have a photo request.
[66:54.04]Give me a pic of two dogs playing with a disc.
[66:55.92]I've heard it.
[66:56.38]This is a common activity.
[66:57.36]Okay.
[67:00.40]Disc right there.
[67:01.00]You gonna go get it?
[67:14.72]Ready?
[67:21.74]Somebody get it.
[67:24.12]There it is.
[67:27.58]There it is, 100%.
[67:28.38]Why is your face in Etalyx today?
[67:33.96]Because I have a crooked face.
[67:38.61]Get over it.
[67:43.19]Alright, submit a photo.
[67:46.39]Dog has to be centered in the photograph and facing the camera for a photo to be considered professional quality.
[67:53.11]That's not the one I wanted to give.
[67:54.18]This photo's bad.
[67:56.16]What about the rule of thirds?
[68:02.44]I didn't want to submit this one.
[68:07.86]Oh, I got the selfie device.
[68:13.84]Selfie mode?
[68:16.73]Wait, what?
[68:21.15]On the camera?
[68:24.12]Okay, that just... I was so confused.
[68:30.28]I thought the camera was floating in front of my face, but that... this is weird.
[68:33.56]Alright.
[68:42.31]This thing is scary.
[68:53.27]Alright, 40 followers.
[68:55.35]42.
[69:03.91]Finally, some good non-dog content.
[69:06.75]I really like that.
[69:07.59]Okay.
[69:21.26]Help clean up the skate park.
[69:25.93]Cool.
[69:26.17]Alright, let's turn that selfie off.
[69:29.79]This game's cute.
[69:30.41]I like it.
[69:36.14]Okay, so now... I'll clean up the skate park.
[69:41.41]Skate park?
[69:43.77]Where's that?
[69:54.56]Why does he always address Holly like a spirit in his house?
[70:00.48]Holly?
[70:01.82]You can hear me.
[70:02.36]Hello, Jeremy.
[70:09.00]My wife's been preparing a birthday... Alright, just delete that.
[70:18.23]Okay, now that I think about like pretzels and shit...
[70:22.28]If there was like a... I found out.
[70:24.28]I got it.
[70:25.78]I'm trying to think of like a food item that I would present to the aliens when they landed.
[70:30.65]Like we had to come together and be like, this is the thing that is the best thing in all of humanity.
[70:35.67]This is the greatest food.
[70:36.67]This is the greatest thing that we could possibly do and eat.
[70:39.85]Because they're going to judge us on it.
[70:43.45]It would be a hot pretzel.
[70:45.67]And I think that the planet would be spared.
[70:48.99]It would be a hot, crispy, soft on the inside, a hot, huge pretzel with salt, a hot thing of like beer cheese, and honey mustard.
[71:00.48]And it would be fine.
[71:04.44]I think it's the single greatest food invention of all humanity.
[71:09.24]I think that's like the greatest thing I've ever had in my life.
[71:16.86]Fuck, beer, cheese.
[71:20.68]Or, we could just A, like cheddar or something.
[71:22.96]Just cheese, like hot cheese.
[71:23.94]Okay.
[71:36.13]Arcade's open now.
[71:38.35]Wait, what?
[71:40.13]Can I play a game?
[71:47.75]If I were the alien, I'd leave.
[71:49.36]The people that are writing gross, we're talking about like a hot pretzel.
[71:53.40]You're doing like a troll face in real life.
[71:57.92]I don't think there's a human on Earth.
[72:00.68]I don't think there's a person that's alive on Earth right now that does not like, would turn down a hot pretzel.
[72:10.57]I can't imagine anybody would ever do that.
[72:16.95]If you're hungry and you know I've got snacks and I go, hey, I got hot pretzels.
[72:21.23]You'd be like, what?
[72:21.91]Oh, OK.
[72:22.61]Nice.
[72:23.47]Really?
[72:24.13]Nice.
[72:24.73]Yes.
[72:29.15]Like if I said, oh, yeah, I've got yogurt.
[72:31.49]I mean, some of you might be like, oh, nice.
[72:32.90]But a lot of you might be like, eh, not really into that.
[72:41.20]If a hot pretzel, everybody would.
[72:42.88]I don't think anybody doesn't like that.
[72:46.23]Pretzels taste like ass.
[72:47.47]They don't.
[72:48.93]Is there a frog in here?
[72:53.95]I'm posting this one.
[73:11.12]Pretzels demonstrate our advance in agriculture and cultivation.
[73:14.08]That's true.
[73:28.07]I mean, it would be, but okay, so I think when he said pizza.
[73:32.31]I don't know.
[73:32.99]I've had some really bad pizza before.
[73:38.66]And I definitely, I don't think I'd want to give the aliens something that's going to give them diarrhea.
[73:43.34]Right?
[73:43.52]So anything else that you could think of.
[73:46.10]Pretzel's not going to give you diarrhea.
[73:48.48]But like a really bad pizza might.
[73:50.00]Because of grease and stuff.
[73:51.94]Or like burger, like we wouldn't want to give the aliens Burger King.
[73:54.38]Because what if they have diarrhea?
[73:55.72]I'd be like, why do they eat this?
[74:08.56]That was a cool photo.
[74:17.99]Where's the skate park?
[74:37.96]You wouldn't want to feed the alien something that was going to give it a gastric upset.
[74:49.80]Pretzels are plain enough, but they wouldn't upset your stomach or anything.
[74:55.56]No, I would not give the aliens Whataburger.
[74:57.24]It's too much.
[75:01.09]Think about it, an alien has not had, like, fucking pizza grease before.
[75:05.69]It's gonna taste it and it's probably gonna shit its pants.
[75:15.97]Taco Bell.
[75:18.72]But you would give them beer cheese.
[75:20.18]No, I didn't say I was gonna give the aliens beer cheese.
[75:22.52]I said that I would prefer beer cheese with that.
[75:36.00]What if the aliens can't process the... I think I cleaned it up, right?
[75:40.79]This is good.
[75:44.03]Is there more trash?
[75:46.19]Oh, hello.
[75:53.37]Yeah.
[75:55.73]What's plain enough?
[75:58.61]Because I'm telling you, what if aliens probably eat... We don't know what their digestive tract is like.
[76:04.97]They might not be able to handle a cheeseburger.
[76:10.55]Banana?
[76:11.25]Oh, that's boring though.
[76:12.25]A baked potato.
[76:15.75]That's kind of plain.
[76:20.17]A crisp apple.
[76:21.38]Actually, you know what?
[76:22.16]That might be the one.
[76:26.94]I don't think you can get, yeah, just like a fresh apple.
[76:33.06]You don't start the aliens with the cheesy gordita crunch.
[76:38.19]The aliens are like, take a bite out of it.
[76:40.67]Cheesy gordita crunch.
[76:42.17]Okay, let's see.
[76:42.87]This is what you are giving us for food.
[76:45.83]And it's the best that you, okay.
[76:51.18]They're gonna like, shit.
[76:52.90]And then they're gonna take their laser gun out and point it at you.
[76:55.52]And like, and liquidate you.
[76:58.24]And then that starts the fucking war, because they're gonna think you poisoned them.
[77:03.33]Way too much fat, too much grease, right?
[77:05.57]And I, trust me, I love these things.
[77:08.03]Spicy ranch would take them out.
[77:16.34]Apple would be probably fine.
[77:17.72]Whoa.
[77:22.12]Give him a ghost pepper?
[77:23.68]They would think- they would see that as an act of war, is what you don't understand.
[77:27.36]They would think that this was poison and you were trying to, like, kill one of their alien ambassadors.
[77:34.62]It's an act of war.
[77:37.36]Give them one single Taki.
[77:42.32]Oh, you need a photo, okay.
[77:51.36]This gate park is now open.
[77:55.08]Of course.
[77:57.88]Oh!
[78:03.47]That looked like it hurt.
[78:04.87]Holy shit.
[78:06.03]Hold on.
[78:35.98]I mean, I got it.
[78:40.56]And what about fluids too?
[78:41.78]Alright, so we figured out like an apple would probably be the best thing to give them first.
[78:47.40]Would it be just water?
[78:49.82]I feel like water is not impressive though.
[78:54.91]Give them Mountain Dew.
[78:56.33]No, that would also be like an active war, I think.
[78:59.29]It'd be like some kind of tea.
[79:04.31]Milk.
[79:12.08]Maybe, like, a lemonade.
[79:13.46]Actually, that might be... What'd you say?
[79:19.84]Strawberry banana smoothie.
[79:21.22]Actually, that might be a good one.
[79:25.56]Red Bull?
[79:27.58]They're not used to caffeine.
[79:29.58]They don't know what caffeine is, and it's like, they take one sip of the Red Bull, they go, Oh!
[79:33.38]Sort of tart!
[79:34.78]What do you call this again?
[79:37.82]And their fucking heads explode.
[79:45.55]We have to be careful.
[79:50.40]I gotta go rest, right?
[79:55.24]Sour warheads.
[80:00.04]No, as an act of war.
[80:09.50]I actually like this one a lot.
[80:17.03]What do you think the aliens would give us?
[80:18.27]I don't know.
[80:22.19]There's no way to know because I don't know.
[80:23.59]I don't have any of their experiences.
[80:24.67]Okay.
[80:28.27]Gain 150 followers.
[80:32.17]The dogs drive cars.
[80:46.91]Is there a dog driving this car?
[80:49.69]Holy sh- Oh my god!
[80:52.59]Ow.
[81:10.46]Posted to dog net right before I got run over.
[81:26.37]I'm the bone seller.
[81:27.55]I need a good photo of our new location.
[81:29.55]Okay.
[81:30.97]And...
[81:39.29]This unit loves dogs, but wonders if it could love ducks.
[81:43.04]A photo of a duck?
[81:46.78]Safety records are lacking.
[81:47.74]We need a photo of a dog with a fire hydrant.
[81:49.54]I already have one.
[81:50.76]Oh, I don't.
[81:51.74]Okay.
[81:53.00]Okay, so we need a photo of a duck, a photo of the shop.
[82:06.11]Down here?
[82:14.21]What if we gave the aliens edibles?
[82:17.03]No, that's an act of war.
[82:18.37]That's cute.
[82:21.01]Okay.
[82:21.87]Is this the store?
[82:23.19]Nice.
[82:23.83]I had 150 followers.
[82:25.09]Can I buy a bone?
[82:26.61]Do you want one?
[82:28.51]Who wants a bone?
[82:30.81]Here.
[82:31.13]Oops.
[82:50.02]I'm trying to get a funny photo where the... Oh, that's funny.
[83:01.74]We can make that... No.
[83:03.96]Anything where the alien would feel different would be a... Why did you... Why do I feel like this?
[83:15.59]And then that's when they would start shooting us with lasers.
[83:29.67]I'm posting this one.
[83:30.67]Just give him gas station sushi.
[83:32.83]Just give him one single olive.
[83:57.03]I'm telling you, a hot pretzel is the way to go.
[83:58.81]Alright, a photo of a duck.
[84:03.63]Sit by the water, maybe?
[84:04.67]Dog with a fire hydrant.
[84:07.65]Oh, I gotta take a picture of a stock chart or something?
[84:26.31]noodles actually might be a big deal just noodles right just like a like a cup noodle like instant ramen yeah I think instant ramen might be a good one to put in there one apple instant ramen
[84:46.59]Because cup noodle in the instant ramen stuff is very, very palatable.
[84:52.77]It's not... It just tastes nice.
[84:56.69]It just tastes nice.
[84:57.79]It's like a broth, right?
[84:58.85]With noodles.
[85:00.57]We don't want to freak them out.
[85:01.43]I mean, that was cool.
[85:24.21]That was fun.
[85:25.57]Good dog.
[85:27.79]Spaghetti?
[85:28.25]I don't know.
[85:30.43]I think the tomato sauce would be a little... would be like an act of war.
[85:35.22]Grilled chicken?
[85:50.65]yeah just grilled seared chicken breast sliced a grilled cheese grilled cheese might be pretty good yeah you got to think of stuff that is very very palatable chicken nuggets maybe
[86:17.49]Honestly, it's like the little kid diet is what we're going to give to aliens.
[86:26.49]Mac and cheese.
[86:28.52]Apples.
[86:30.32]Chicken nuggets.
[86:32.74]Like, noodles.
[86:35.08]But that's why, though, right?
[86:37.66]Like, little kids can sometimes be really picky eaters.
[86:41.31]And those are all very, very plain, very palatable.
[86:43.83]Very...
[86:53.02]I can dress up the dogs.
[86:54.04]Cheese strings, yup.
[87:05.37]Literally anything from this planet would be poison to aliens.
[87:08.15]I don't think so.
[87:08.79]Pixel lens?
[87:15.99]Can I buy another lens?
[87:17.12]I need, uh, there's other lenses.
[87:22.74]Okay, let's get the, uh, where's this weird thing?
[87:27.82]The charts with the up and down lines, I've lost them.
[87:29.84]They should be on an easel near a picnic bench.
[87:32.57]That doesn't give me very much.
[87:39.11]Watch out!
[87:39.97]Why am I moving in real life?
[87:42.16]It's like a cute dog game.
[87:57.35]This is the inception music.
[88:21.84]You did such a good job painting that painting.
[88:24.22]Here's a delicious treat.
[88:39.36]That's a good one.
[88:44.69]This one's going on DogNet.
[89:00.95]Is this like me branching out to other animals?
[89:04.84]Like, oh, I know this is DogNet, but, like, I'm going to be taking pictures of birds now as well.
[89:10.17]That one was popular.
[89:15.19]I like this one.
[89:35.27]Alright, so now find the business cats chart.
[89:40.79]There's a niche duck community.
[89:50.98]What about music?
[89:54.97]Would you introduce breakcore to aliens?
[89:57.89]No.
[90:00.14]I think I would start with a snare drum.
[90:02.90]I would just get into a room.
[90:04.96]Like, okay, everyone relax.
[90:06.66]We're all relaxing.
[90:07.72]Just hanging out.
[90:09.20]There's a drum in here.
[90:10.46]One snare drum.
[90:12.06]And there's two of us in the room.
[90:13.26]Two of the aliens.
[90:15.02]And I want to show you this.
[90:16.88]Just watch.
[90:17.30]Ready?
[90:18.08]Like... And they're going to put their back against the wall.
[90:24.39]And they're going to be fucking terrified.
[90:25.61]And I mean, just very slow.
[90:30.99]And I'll be like, you, you do too, right?
[90:33.05]Like, guh, guh.
[90:35.03]See?
[90:35.72]Kinetic energy.
[90:39.38]I don't think you go full-on band.
[90:42.00]No.
[90:43.00]And not electric guitar either.
[90:47.44]It's one snare drum, and then maybe a flute.
[90:52.10]Just like... That's it.
[90:57.16]And then just relax, because it's going to be a lot for them.
[91:02.43]And then I say, you, pop, pop, pop, you, that.
[91:09.55]And they go, oh.
[91:12.55]And then I go, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[91:16.22]And then it's, that's music.
[91:17.34]That's what we call music.
[91:20.16]And then you can give them a CD of fucking your favorite Alanis Morissette songs.
[91:24.00]You know what I mean?
[91:25.32]Then you give them a CD of all the Blink-182 albums you have.
[91:28.45]And then they'll figure it out, right?
[91:34.54]Can you give him the Slipknot album?
[91:43.06]Okay, so where- I gotta find a park bench?
[91:53.31]Picnic bench.
[91:57.15]Now that's one big hydrant.
[92:08.25]All you guys that want to have like a big band... No, there's too many instruments.
[92:13.79]It's like... Like there's too many sounds that they've never heard before.
[92:20.54]You guys want to have a full drum set, a saxophone, a flute, a cello player, two electric guitars, a piano.
[92:28.12]They would... You... They wouldn't be able to handle it.
[92:32.83]You gotta start very slow.
[92:48.16]That's just a cool picture.
[92:51.56]Maybe some lounge jazz?
[92:52.98]Yeah, that's what I would go to next.
[92:55.39]Just very, very light, smooth jazz.
[92:58.95]I'm talking like the Hey Arnold background music.
[93:01.75]That's the kind of stuff that I would level them up to.
[93:03.84]Just that kind of like...
[93:19.39]I can't find this picnic bench.
[93:22.53]A picnic bench would be like in the park.
[93:23.93]At least that's what I think.
[93:28.23]I mean, this is a picnic bench.
[93:35.63]And there is a cheeseburger here.
[93:41.19]They mastered space travel, but they can't handle a drum set.
[93:50.42]Cheeseburg, people happy.
[93:52.18]You want a cheeseburger?
[93:55.86]No!
[93:56.46]Hello.
[93:56.72]A cheeseburger.
[94:23.55]What?
[94:23.67]That's a huge stick!
[94:25.85]Wow!
[94:26.13]No, watch out, watch out!
[94:28.45]That is the biggest stick I've ever seen!
[94:33.05]Nice job!
[94:55.05]Heisenberg What kind of dog is this?
[94:57.92]Oh, it's a puppy, okay.
[95:28.11]Wow.
[95:28.69]Hold on.
[95:33.77]That's a big stick.
[95:34.79]I'm saving this one.
[95:35.87]Alright, now it's spam.
[95:45.88]This is my favorite one, I think, so far.
[95:47.72]You look really angular.
[95:48.78]I know.
[95:49.12]It's because I flipped the... My face is going like this because I flipped the camera horizontally.
[96:11.71]I want to go... Wait, this is kind of cool.
[96:17.53]Oh, they're watching.
[96:18.95]Perfect opportunity to get an awesome, cool photo here.
[96:21.14]Ready?
[96:22.02]I need to go lower.
[96:44.03]I need a wider lens.
[96:45.29]I love wide angle lenses.
[96:50.47]How do we feel about this one?
[96:59.74]Now that is what I would call an unbelievably good photo.
[97:18.63]Is this your last photo for today, spam?
[97:20.71]Well, unfollow me then.
[97:21.73]Fuck off.
[97:23.27]Wait.
[97:25.11]Stay right there. Stay right there. Stay right there. Stay right there.
[98:03.20]Got it!
[98:04.62]Pick this one apart.
[98:07.66]This is not dog shit.
[98:33.42]I have to go home.
[98:36.76]I gotta find this painting.
[98:39.22]How do I get the new camera parts?
[98:55.58]you've ever played the new spider-man games um I streamed the the new spider-man game that came out it was ps4 exclusive like the spider-man game I didn't play the new ps5 one though I don't have ps5 yeah five years ago
[99:19.49]Miles Morales one is really good.
[99:21.24]It looks good, but I have to get a PS5.
[99:24.58]I'm going to tell you something right now.
[99:27.72]Every time I want to get a PS5, I just can't.
[99:29.34]It's on PC.
[99:30.02]Oh.
[99:45.09]And I'll be really, really honest, I know some of you, I don't want to be like, oh, it's the console war, here we go.
[99:50.81]What's even on PS5?
[99:52.85]Besides Demon's Souls, which is the reason to buy the console, right?
[99:56.19]What's on PS5 that's like an exclusive that's worth getting the console for?
[100:01.48]Because I'll be very, very completely upfront, I have to be incredibly honest with you.
[100:05.24]The Xbox Game Pass is actually kind of fucking unbeatable.
[100:09.28]It's actually amazing.
[100:14.24]Like, I have found so many games through Game Pass just because they're ready to play.
[100:18.98]They're right there.
[100:20.52]And 80% of them, you don't even have to install them.
[100:23.54]You just play them in the cloud.
[100:26.54]I'm being dead serious about that.
[100:29.97]And games like service type shit like that, I'm not bullshitting you.
[100:34.23]I wouldn't bullshit you.
[100:36.22]The games as a service type stuff.
[100:38.64]Think about like the Switch.
[100:40.16]Like the, oh, we're going to release games.
[100:42.36]Like the SNES and N64 type shit.
[100:46.32]Yeah, maybe once every two fucking months you'll see something.
[100:49.70]There are at least three to five new games on Game Pass.
[100:53.38]It feels like every couple fucking weeks.
[100:55.94]I'm dead serious.
[100:59.42]They load that shit up all the time.
[101:01.28]It's actually awesome.
[101:11.67]He's bullshitting us.
[101:12.51]No, I just told you I wasn't.
[101:13.99]Can you play Dark Messiah, Might, and Magic?
[101:17.77]I already streamed it.
[101:19.11]That game is amazing.
[101:19.73]Alright, where is this stupid thing?
[101:21.88]I have to find this picnic bench.
[101:26.84]This person has like stalks all over him.
[101:42.24]I shouldn't have done that into the street.
[101:46.29]They remove them too, don't they?
[101:48.55]So games will cycle through it.
[101:54.19]They have, I think, like a hundred something games that are always getting kind of cycled through.
[102:03.16]But they're there for long enough where you can just play them.
[102:06.90]I actually think you can install some of them too.
[102:12.03]There are a few constraints, yeah.
[102:15.33]Okay, PlayStation Now was garbage.
[102:20.84]It was garbage.
[102:22.58]I remember trying to use it.
[102:24.64]It didn't fucking work.
[102:26.58]I got disconnected like 70% of the time when I used it.
[102:29.54]It was trash.
[102:31.06]It was absolute trash.
[102:32.81]And I really hate to say that because I like Sony's games and I like PlayStation.
[102:39.28]This Xbox, um, cloud service is like everything that Stadia wanted to be and it just works and it's better in every conceivable way.
[102:47.35]Every conceivable way.
[102:49.17]Is it better now?
[102:51.41]When I tried to use it a few years ago, it was like, this is, like, why am I even trying?
[102:56.79]Alright, I'm just gonna reset.
[103:12.62]It's better now.
[103:13.32]Copium.
[103:14.06]It might be.
[103:14.46]It was bad before.
[103:16.14]Am I trying to play Red Dead Redemption?
[103:24.81]I think... Oh my god, I'm getting a flashback.
[103:27.41]Do you guys remember when I told you about that time when I was screaming in the car?
[103:33.86]And I forgot my credit card?
[103:37.20]Like, I went to, like, Walmart or something, and I forgot my credit card.
[103:40.74]I couldn't get the game to run on the Xbox or something.
[103:43.94]And I was, like, screaming, going back and forth in the car, right?
[103:52.65]And then I tried to just play it on PS Now, and it just disconnected every 15 seconds.
[103:57.63]Then I just turned the stream off.
[104:04.55]That might have been the worst stream, like, ever.
[104:07.07]That's probably the worst stream I've ever done.
[104:10.07]Yeah, 100%.
[104:17.41]It was so awful.
[104:18.59]It was just so painful.
[104:19.65]Everything was awful.
[104:20.41]Everything sucked that day.
[104:21.55]It was just so bad.
[104:25.89]Oh, I know what that is.
[104:33.35]It was your first collab with Vinny, too.
[104:35.23]That's right!
[104:42.93]Different artist today?
[104:48.12]Okay.
[104:52.18]Uh, two dogs with bones.
[104:54.28]Dog playing in the playground.
[104:55.52]I find the business cat.
[104:57.80]Alright, the playground's over here.
[105:02.71]Actually, I can buy the bones.
[105:12.62]Playtime activities.
[105:13.90]Oh.
[105:15.74]This is a playtime activity?
[105:19.14]Okay.
[105:20.22]Uhh... Two dogs with bones.
[105:22.14]Okay, so I need to get some bones.
[105:40.09]Alright, come over here.
[105:40.73]I thought that was a chicken.
[105:43.26]Alright, let's get the bones over here.
[105:50.44]Okay, there's one.
[105:55.10]And you want one too.
[105:56.40]Look over here.
[105:57.88]Snowflake!
[105:59.40]Snowflake!
[106:00.06]Snowflake!
[106:00.76]Look over here.
[106:03.97]Snowflake!
[106:15.13]85 followers.
[106:23.66]Picnic bench.
[106:25.76]Okay, is this a picnic bench?
[106:28.72]Or is a picnic bench a picnic table?
[106:30.72]This is like a picnic bench.
[106:39.56]A picnic table is a picnic table, right?
[106:50.69]Found it.
[106:51.29]Alright, I just need followers now.
[106:59.82]What's this?
[107:00.98]Oh, Dole Whip!
[107:02.52]Should I post the stocks?
[107:21.47]How long did it take me to line this up?
[107:23.59]Not long at all.
[107:24.29]Alright, 85.
[107:26.67]Alright, there's a hidden envelope.
[107:35.53]I love the flip.
[107:39.35]Do you guys remember those little dog toys?
[107:43.82]They were kind of scary.
[107:45.99]Where it was a little dog... It looked like a stuffed animal, but it was hard.
[107:50.00]And it was like... And then this thing... Went... And did a full backflip.
[108:01.29]It was kind of terrifying.
[108:06.23]I'm just I'm bringing myself back to an era with a bunch of weird animal like mechanical toys like that do you remember there was like the little gopher or like a ferret that there was a ball and it just kind of rolled around with the ball yeah and they would always be in this little playpen at the mall
[108:27.03]There was a store and in the front of the store was like a little, it probably was about chest high.
[108:33.66]And it was a circle area that they put all this shit in.
[108:37.46]They put two flipping dogs, three ferret balls, two like cat things.
[108:43.10]And they would always fall out.
[108:44.44]They would always flip out of the thing and always fall out of the thing.
[108:48.65]I wonder how hard it would be to track one of those down.
[108:52.09]They were violent.
[108:59.80]Hamsters?
[109:00.32]Yeah.
[109:08.46]They still sell those at flea markets.
[109:13.02]And you could hear it across the mall.
[109:14.87]Yes, you really could.
[109:16.95]You could.
[109:17.79]You would be 60 meters.
[109:20.71]You'd be 100 meters away.
[109:21.95]And all you would hear would be like... Go, go, go.
[109:35.85]That's all you could hear.
[109:36.61]I completely forgot that you could actually hear it.
[109:46.93]How much is a meter?
[109:47.71]A meter is... A yard is three feet.
[109:53.22]A meter... One yard is three feet.
[109:58.65]So that means a meter is 2.2 pounds.
[110:04.46]That's a kilo.
[110:08.34]A meter is... I don't know.
[110:12.18]One yard is three feet.
[110:14.46]2.2 pounds is one kilogram.
[110:19.07]And a meter is exactly... I don't know.
[110:26.07]Three and a half feet?
[110:26.67]3.2 feet?
[110:48.78]I'm spamming, but I don't care.
[110:52.68]3.2 feet.
[110:54.50]So why do we use Yard then?
[110:56.36]Oh wait, is Yard dumb, dope American stuff?
[111:01.60]Is Yard... Oh no, he's American.
[111:08.04]He's American, stupid idiot, right?
[111:25.52]What the hell?
[111:27.04]Hold on.
[111:31.22]He's pissed.
[111:34.36]Get out of the way.
[111:35.83]You're spilling it everywhere.
[111:36.91]They are driving the cars.
[111:40.65]That's so weird.
[111:58.34]What is freezing in Celsius?
[111:59.77]Zero.
[112:01.23]Ask me more of these.
[112:02.03]That's fine.
[112:27.90]How many meters in a kilometer?
[112:29.18]I don't... I don't... You don't even know that.
[112:38.64]Yeah, okay.
[112:39.18]I don't know meters to kilometers.
[112:40.78]I could dodge a fucking battle axe.
[112:43.15]Who gives a shit?
[112:46.09]I don't think you guys understand.
[112:49.63]Like, who cares?
[112:51.52]You don't know what a meter to kilometers to then to, uh, micrometers, uh, then, uh, do that, deduce that to yards?
[113:00.19]No, but I can dodge a battleaxe.
[113:01.87]And, uh, you can't.
[113:08.54]And I'll prove it to you.
[113:11.60]It's in the name.
[113:25.12]Kilobyte.
[113:34.29]What is kilo?
[113:35.49]What is kilo?
[113:36.09]What is that?
[113:37.99]What is that?
[113:39.71]What is kilo?
[113:40.67]What is kilo?
[113:41.71]What is it?
[113:42.09]A thousand, yeah.
[113:44.84]What is it though?
[113:55.09]What is it, Latin?
[113:55.69]Yeah, Elizabeth's Latin.
[113:59.45]I don't know something about Greek God's fucking name.
[114:01.72]So what?
[114:09.83]Yes, the Greek God.
[114:10.85]Kilometer.
[114:21.79]The prefix kilo is derived from the Greek word kilio, meaning a thousand.
[114:26.27]Yeah, uh-huh.
[114:28.53]Oh no, I didn't know that's what it was.
[114:32.55]If I took more than one second... I'm playing a video game, and I'm talking about aliens eating pretzels, okay?
[114:38.48]I'm... I'm busy.
[114:41.64]I don't have time to think about what a kilometer is.
[114:44.46]What a fucked up question.
[114:48.28]Like, imagine you're sitting there...
[114:51.04]Okay, imagine you're sitting there, and somebody just kind of walks up to you, you're busy.
[114:53.94]Somebody's just like, hey, what's a kilometer?
[114:57.52]It's like, I don't know, Frank, fucking leave me alone.
[115:00.60]Like, I'm busy.
[115:04.43]I'd be like, what are you asking?
[115:06.81]How much is a kilo?
[115:08.57]Is kilo Greek?
[115:09.55]Is that what you're asking?
[115:11.29]What are you, what question, why you want, how much is a kilometer?
[115:13.59]Frank, it's a distance of some kind.
[115:26.46]You're a himbo.
[115:29.21]Fine.
[115:32.85]I need to- I wanna buy this new stuff.
[115:44.81]You were a substitute teacher.
[115:46.19]You don't... Guys, I don't need to have... I don't... Substitute teaching was essentially me, like, just keeping the classroom in order.
[115:56.76]It wasn't like, oh, by the way, students, a kilometer is a thousand kilometers, and a millimeter is a million... No, it was just a... Honestly, it was just to make sure, like, the students behaved.
[116:30.19]Millicenty... One one-thousandth, one one-hundredth.
[116:34.29]Yeah, I know!
[116:36.19]Do you think I need to know that for this?
[116:37.79]Do I need to know what a millimeter to ounces is?
[116:44.71]And fuck everybody.
[116:45.53]Fuck everybody.
[116:47.49]You definitely still type into Google, um... Ounces to, uh, to liters.
[116:55.25]Everybody does.
[116:56.09]Don't even, don't even pretend.
[116:58.11]Don't pretend.
[117:00.81]you still type Google ounces to liters um conversion and you type it in and because you don't know don't even tell me don't even tell me you don't do that I don't believe it what's an ounce you look so cute
[117:32.76]I gotta leave the... I'm gonna go to this other quest in the other area.
[117:35.68]They're different measurement units, dude.
[117:40.02]Cognitive Dissonance Danny.
[117:49.95]All metric is easy.
[117:51.01]It's just times 10.
[118:01.77]Yo, I heard Tony Bark is in town.
[118:03.73]I'm really busy trying to stop a different skate park from getting demolished.
[118:07.17]Will you give me a shot of him shredding the pipe?
[118:10.61]Okay.
[118:13.30]The old arcade is open again.
[118:14.44]I haven't heard if it's getting used, though.
[118:16.04]Can you find out for me?
[118:16.88]It's definitely getting used.
[118:20.70]Let's take a look.
[118:21.16]The place is bumping.
[118:27.14]Oh, a close-up of a dog at the arcade.
[118:32.33]That looks pretty good.
[118:35.21]That's a good photo.
[118:41.90]What's your favorite photo?
[118:42.90]That one's better.
[119:09.05]Hey kid, you got some real talent.
[119:10.33]I can see that.
[119:10.79]But your photos, they're severely lacking in the fear department.
[119:14.79]Unleash me from the vending machine.
[119:15.97]I can show you a new world of expression.
[119:17.13]All I have to do is watch.
[119:18.51]Okay, what?
[119:27.25]Oh, there's Tony Bark.
[119:28.86]I gotta get him doing the thing.
[119:37.54]Half of photography is just waiting.
[120:14.94]Got it.
[120:18.64]Uh, okay.
[120:20.66]There's new stuff on the... Hold on.
[120:24.58]Wait, what's wrong?
[120:27.29]Okay.
[120:52.78]Didn't I get it?
[120:53.24]Oh, that's... I don't like... That's sad.
[120:59.92]Oh, no.
[121:01.88]Um... Somebody said, are you going to play Frog Detective?
[121:11.75]Not today.
[121:13.27]I'm very sick.
[121:14.79]Well, not very sick.
[121:18.69]It's okay.
[121:20.92]Wait, where'd you go?
[121:21.52]I want to make sure you know that it's okay.
[121:24.20]Where are you?
[121:25.22]Oh, it's okay.
[121:25.66]Don't worry.
[121:27.98]I'm like, oh, I'm very sick.
[121:30.21]No, I'm sick.
[121:31.91]I have like a sinus cold.
[121:34.19]I don't know what's happening.
[121:36.85]I have to do a bunch of pressure here.
[121:39.51]My throat's all fucked up.
[121:41.35]And my ears are popped.
[121:42.27]So...
[121:45.12]I wanted to stream, though.
[121:45.92]I didn't want to just not stream.
[121:47.76]Because I feel like I've been away from the computer for a while.
[121:50.48]I wanted to at least hang out for a bit.
[121:54.74]I tested for COVID already a few times, so... It is not COVID.
[122:01.28]But, I don't know.
[122:02.40]Maybe, who knows.
[122:03.08]I'll test again tomorrow or tonight.
[122:06.64]If I get worse, then I'm just going to stream tomorrow, but we'll see.
[122:14.45]I need more... I need 150 followers.
[122:15.78]It could be a different virus.
[122:23.24]Zinc up.
[122:24.90]I'm alright.
[122:25.52]I'm good.
[122:27.59]I just took... I feel actually okay right now because I've been taking this, um... This, like, Tylenol cold and flu thing.
[122:36.49]Essentially, it's just kind of pumping myself up.
[122:39.73]It's like the cold medicine.
[122:43.44]I'll be fine, though.
[122:43.98]Don't worry.
[122:45.66]It's literally just probably a cold.
[122:49.28]But if it changes by tomorrow, I'll let you know.
[122:51.76]Alright, I need... I just need 150 followers.
[122:58.26]135.
[123:02.76]They like that one.
[123:04.36]Plus three.
[123:13.03]Oh, there it is.
[123:15.52]To the moon.
[123:19.17]We love the moon.
[123:21.31]I unlocked the moon?
[123:31.00]One inch is about two and a half centimeters, so it's not a huge difference.
[123:36.21]You know, it's kind of funny.
[123:37.17]I've talked so much shit about how there should be a standard buttons on all controllers.
[123:44.15]Because remember I said, oh, pressing A is annoying because if I press A on an Xbox, I'm actually pressing B on a Nintendo.
[123:52.74]Or, you know, like X on a PlayStation.
[123:57.26]Make them all the same, right?
[123:58.42]And then we don't have to worry about it.
[123:59.66]Oh yeah, I did say get Congress involved.
[124:08.60]I distinctly remember what you're talking about.
[124:10.68]I like screamed that too.
[124:16.41]Was that during... What stream was that?
[124:19.65]Yeah, I was like fucking pissed.
[124:23.59]I was really pissed off.
[124:27.33]It was Super Monkey Ball.
[124:28.88]Oh, yeah.
[124:34.30]Whatever.
[124:34.62]Oh, there's new items.
[124:46.71]Imagine somebody on like, um... What is it?
[124:49.59]Like, C... What's that government political kind of like Congress channel?
[124:55.44]Somebody's up there with like a bunch of papers.
[124:56.82]Like, this is what I want to show you.
[124:59.00]We need to standardize.
[125:01.68]C-Span, yeah.
[125:02.52]We need to standardize.
[125:03.44]This is me.
[125:03.84]I'm putting forth a bill.
[125:05.76]Uh... Standardize game controller.
[125:07.58]225.
[125:08.92]I'm getting real sick and tired of pressing B when I want to press A.
[125:14.64]My fellow friends on the other side of the aisle seem to not care about that.
[125:18.38]They want to keep it.
[125:19.52]So when you press X, you might accidentally be pressing B. See?
[125:30.15]They always do that.
[125:31.53]It's so fucking annoying.
[125:33.69]I hate when they do that.
[125:35.55]Okay, so if it's a Democrat talking about a Republican, a Republican talking about a Democrat, they always go, See my friends on the other side of the aisle.
[125:42.01]Stop that.
[125:44.73]Oh, my friend's over there.
[125:46.29]Oh, you see, my friend's over there.
[125:48.36]Like, alright.
[125:49.72]Like, friend, like, come on.
[126:00.49]Politics, baby.
[126:19.20]My evil foes.
[126:21.72]I don't even think that would be like kind of funny though.
[126:24.48]I feel like I would be more, I feel like, okay.
[126:26.32]If all of a sudden, if like one of the Democrats was just like, now my evil foes on the other side of the aisle there, I feel like it'd be like, that's funny.
[126:35.49]You kind of got me there.
[126:36.53]Like I've, that's funny.
[126:46.95]My arch nemesis.
[126:51.22]First enemies.
[126:56.01]I feel like that would make one of those old motherfuckers laugh.
[126:58.99]And then they'd sign your bill.
[127:02.67]You see Senator Davidson over there.
[127:05.03]Senator Stevenson.
[127:06.59]You know, one of my true enemies.
[127:08.67]And then they cut to him and he's like, I'll sign it now.
[127:12.61]I'll sign it.
[127:24.74]Alright, I'm doing the build of my craft house and take it down over and over again.
[127:28.58]I just need to go to the machine.
[127:36.53]The vending machine.
[127:41.11]There's one over here.
[127:44.65]Nice gameplay.
[127:45.39]Yeah.
[128:02.92]Earthy pack.

[128:30.61]Alien.
[128:34.46]C-M-Y-K.
[128:44.17]Predator vision.
[128:48.75]Don't you just wish that, like, on Halloween, you know, one of those, like, senators is in, like, a banana costume.
[128:53.97]You know what I mean?
[128:57.17]Just gets up there and just like, let me tell you, you might think I look ridiculous, but my friends on the other side of the aisle, they're the ridiculous ones.
[129:05.72]You know, I feel like I feel like I was pretty good in late Congress.
[129:08.82]I feel like I would I could do it.
[129:09.96]I think I would be able to do it.
[129:23.54]Where's the pixel one?
[129:27.28]No, you couldn't.
[129:48.06]What is this face?
[129:49.66]What did I just do?
[129:50.40]I just flash banged him.
[129:51.74]What?
[129:52.26]I'm so sorry.
[129:52.82]I didn't mean to do that.
[129:56.05]Oh my god.
[129:56.87]I am so sorry.
[130:03.05]My friends on the other side of the aisle over there.
[130:05.09]Alright, let me leave here.
[130:18.92]He would never get elected.
[130:20.60]I don't think I would.
[130:22.93]Can I keep going this way?
[130:24.55]Oh, new request.
[130:38.10]Do you know that tire swinging is considered an extreme sport?
[130:42.06]I think I know where that is.
[130:42.82]I need a pixel lens.
[130:54.30]I have Arcade?

[132:16.56]Rare, yeah.
[132:33.76]So funny, I love depth of field, but I hate depth of field in video games.
[132:39.28]The first thing that I do, I always just turn off every single thing in the video settings.
[132:46.16]Motion blur, depth of field, chromatic abrasion, they all go off.
[132:52.75]Oh, I'm... Okay, that's cool.

[137:00.80]Um... I... I need to see auto.
[137:04.22]I can't just do it.
[137:05.66]None of these are auto.
[137:06.36]That kind of looks... No, it doesn't.
[137:10.02]I almost did it.
[137:10.54]You heard it.
[137:10.90]It was coming out.

[139:40.79]He's trying to make it seem like it's effortless.
[139:47.41]Stop doing that.
[139:49.67]Pixel lens.
[139:50.09]This looks like shit.
[140:08.32]Is this pixel lens or is this a, um, a 160p stream?
[140:15.36]Photo of a biking- Oh, a dog on a bike.
[140:20.56]That's kind of cool looking.
[140:23.28]Alright, dog on a bike.

[140:49.23]Wait, what?
[140:57.72]Like a rocket ship?
[140:59.00]How do I go to that one?
[141:02.78]Oh, it's the moon.
[141:03.78]The actual moon?

[141:52.39]I think they were just saying, like, thanks for playing.
[141:55.40]Oh, alright.
[141:57.68]It's like an alien!
[142:11.13]Three moon dogs in the Earth.
[142:21.31]Okay.
[142:22.97]Can you show me what a real flying saucer looks like?
[142:24.99]I want every dog on Earth.
[142:31.66]Okay, I want to take a picture of Earth.
[142:35.00]Where's Earth?
[142:36.30]Is that Earth?
[142:39.76]There's actual gravity that's funny.
[142:45.85]A tiny flying saucer you can take photos with.
[142:47.83]Mini UFO.
[142:48.43]Wait, what?
[142:48.83]What?
[142:59.51]Oh, it's like a drone.
[143:01.79]That's cool.
[143:07.55]Picture of the dino.
[143:23.75]I feel like if you posted this to DogNet...
[143:27.12]You should get way more than four likes on this.
[143:30.90]Like, I'm on the moon, man.
[143:32.96]I'm on the moon.
[143:33.74]Like, bro, I'm on the moon.
[143:40.70]I think this deserves at least a thousand likes.
[143:49.87]This is actually a cool dogless pic.
[143:55.63]I'm more interested in close-up shots of dog outfits.
[143:59.15]Didn't like it.
[143:59.76]Okay.
[144:05.32]Yes, the sun!
[144:06.28]Hey, you gave me a like, that's all I care about, even if you're wrong.
[144:14.71]You can be completely wrong, that's fine.
[144:16.25]Alright, what do they have to say about this?
[144:23.73]It's refreshing to see a no-dog phone.
[144:25.71]I'm more interested in close-ups of dogs with outfits.
[144:28.21]I can't believe you aren't more famous.
[144:29.67]Zoom.
[144:34.15]Oh, these are all my fans.
[144:36.65]It's mostly art kits?
[144:55.83]We've made extraterrestrial contact and they come in peace.
[144:59.20]An astronaut and an alien dog just hanging out.
[145:01.22]Okay.
[145:21.30]That's a flying saucer, right?
[145:25.66]Oh, pixel lens shit.
[145:27.60]What?
[145:27.94]That's a flying saucer, isn't it?
[145:55.11]Can you show me what a real flying saucer looks like?
[145:56.81]Be sure to use the pixel lens.
[146:04.88]That's a good photo of a flying saucer.
[146:06.88]Oh, wait.
[146:07.34]Turn around.
[146:08.92]What?
[146:09.24]No, that's like a satellite.
[146:33.00]What's that?
[146:34.74]Like a sled?
[146:35.34]Alright, where's the flying saucer?
[146:54.42]Got it.
[146:56.92]Alright, I need an alien and astronaut.
[147:02.62]This song is really good.
[147:10.86]And they have to be happy.
[147:14.13]I mean, this is one right here.
[147:17.51]That's an alien dog, right?
[147:23.19]That counts, right?
[147:25.83]Did you hear that?
[147:31.45]Do I have a Gatorade sitting on my desk here?
[147:33.77]And it just... popped, it went BOOM!
[147:38.53]I don't know, I have no idea why.
[147:39.51]Those were... 200 followers, nice.
[147:48.03]A challenge, take a really good photo using film from the Stylish Pack.
[147:53.78]Okay.
[147:57.92]Stylish Pack was... like, arcade, right?
[148:02.45]Why not use the alien one?
[148:07.74]Bar out film pack?
[148:09.10]No, stylus.
[148:09.82]Here we go.
[148:10.12]How about mocha?
[148:13.42]We'll do focus lens.
[148:20.10]Wait, actually... That's kind of cool, right?
[148:27.47]That's pretty cool.
[148:30.56]Out of focus on purpose.
[148:32.80]Alien.
[148:33.52]Interesting.
[148:34.54]Staring.
[148:36.08]Creepy.
[148:37.62]Funky.
[148:38.06]Alright.
[148:40.22]I gotta line this up.
[148:59.92]That's kind of cool looking.
[149:08.47]You're doing something cool right now.
[149:15.46]Ah, it's like a shitty photo, but it's alright.
[149:20.77]Three dogs in the frame and the Earth.
[149:32.23]That's actually not bad.
[149:34.09]Could have moved it a little bit to the left.
[149:35.36]I'm going to.
[149:35.86]Nice lock screen.
[149:47.54]Actually, pretty good lock screen.
[149:50.94]Okay.
[149:55.73]Why is there a gas station on the moon here?
[150:07.79]see you later that was radical nice job that was a good trick alright let me check out the other area
[150:38.55]Oh, you unlock daytime and nighttime and stuff.
[150:46.84]This is a cool area.
[150:49.16]It's beautiful scenery.
[150:58.69]I like that.
[151:08.87]get one of these, you know what I mean?
[151:13.56]What do you think about this photo?
[151:17.90]How do you feel about this one?
[151:25.62]Dog shit or good?
[151:27.05]Probably could have zoomed in a little more.
[151:32.79]Uh-oh.
[151:42.00]Alright, what do you want?
[151:42.52]What do you got objectives here?
[151:44.84]Any dog and bird will do, but the dog needs to look like it really loves being there.
[151:48.89]Oh, there's birds.
[151:53.09]Okay.
[151:53.61]Get a picture of a bird.
[151:54.31]I feel like this is the right lens to use.
[152:14.90]It's like the TF2 bird.
[152:19.50]I gotta go up there.
[152:21.72]I need a dog and a bird.
[152:33.20]Can you pet the birds?
[152:45.95]When you take the rule of thirds way too far.
[153:04.22]OK, there is a bird.
[153:05.44]There's one over here.
[153:06.12]I think that works.
[153:16.40]Oh, a friendly dog with a bird.
[153:18.02]Hold on.
[153:18.32]Come over here.
[153:20.10]Come here.
[153:21.46]Come over here.
[153:34.52]I think that's perfect.
[153:36.43]Actually perfect.
[153:37.09]Yep.
[153:38.45]Okay.
[153:43.30]Wouldn't it be cool to have a game of Minecraft?
[153:45.82]Pixelated dog in Minecraft.
[153:51.58]Bird photographer simulator.
[153:56.73]What?
[153:58.57]I'll have to play that soon.
[154:01.15]Pixelated dog in a mine cart.
[154:04.03]And then a fun challenge.
[154:05.43]Photo using film from the far out pack.
[154:08.31]And then a dog in a mine cart.
[154:19.94]Oh, here's the mine.
[154:28.88]Oh, it's not pixelized.
[154:30.30]Shit.
[154:32.12]What?
[154:57.12]Dog shit.
[154:59.18]No, it's not.
[155:02.92]This photo is not dog shit.
[155:09.70]Look at these.
[155:10.30]You think these are bad?
[155:11.28]Look at these photos.
[155:12.02]Okay, photo from the fire watch tower.
[155:25.83]And then safety alert.
[155:28.73]When you do something about them, throw the scoot vac in the trash and send me proof.
[155:36.14]Okay, uh, far out pack.
[155:38.42]Whoa, okay.
[155:40.20]That one.
[156:05.08]This one's cool.
[156:05.86]I like it.
[156:07.96]Alright, I gotta get a scoot back, put it in the trash, and then I have to take a picture of the fire watchtower.
[156:17.60]That one was actually bad.
[156:18.90]Yeah, it was.
[156:25.84]I told you I wanted to do the bird watching stream.
[156:29.00]Where I actually just go and get a bunch of equipment.
[156:32.78]And go to a place where we can really see some actual real birds.
[156:37.56]And set you guys up with a lens.
[156:40.04]So you can see.
[156:41.12]Finagle let's do the bird watching stream.
[156:50.73]Go get lenses that like pro lenses.
[156:58.28]That stream is going to be really awful.
[157:02.72]What if we don't see any birds?
[157:10.53]What is all this?
[157:17.83]Oh, so this is I'm opening it up at night.
[157:28.48]What is this?
[157:30.02]Stripe lens?
[157:30.90]I kind of want to try the candy one.
[157:36.06]You should get an actor to show up in a bird costume.
[157:41.38]I think that's probably what would happen.
[157:47.95]It's like somebody would just be in a huge bird outfit.
[157:52.01]Oh no, fuck that.
[157:53.45]But don't tell anybody this because this is going to be funny.
[157:56.81]I shouldn't say this.
[157:59.01]Because I feel like it would be really funny.
[158:05.73]I'm not going to say it.
[158:06.51]Because it's like the whole stream.
[158:09.23]I'm not going to say it.
[158:09.95]Nope.
[158:10.37]I'm going to keep it in the back pocket.
[158:12.01]But I want to do something on that stream.
[158:14.98]That's going to be really fucking stupid.
[158:18.82]Yeah.
[158:19.40]Now I know why I can.
[158:20.66]This is how I can do this stream.
[158:26.93]And I'm putting it down now.
[158:28.69]I'm going for it.
[158:32.01]We have made jokes about this stream for a long time.
[158:36.36]I'm going to go for it now.
[158:38.02]I'm actually going to go for it.
[158:39.16]It's not going to happen for a while.
[158:40.70]I'm just telling you.
[158:43.10]It's already like shit being planned for the next couple months.
[158:46.37]This is something that is going to have to be later.
[158:49.39]Like probably next year.
[158:53.29]But, I think that's fun to do.
[158:56.14]Alright, I gotta go to the fire watch tower.
[159:05.02]Spring.
[159:05.34]Yeah, spring would be perfect.
[159:16.53]What are these- what are these little weirdos?
[159:18.19]What are these- what are these little weirdos?
[159:19.95]What are these dogs?
[159:20.65]Like the big goofy dogs?
[159:25.06]they're so cute what are they pomeranian yeah they're always they're always doing like they're always like you know what I'm saying you know what I mean good one
[159:55.01]You now go to the cove at sunset for some dramatic magic hour lighting.
[159:58.71]Okay, I need to do the trash.
[160:03.38]Pomeranians are very sassy.
[160:13.71]What?
[160:16.45]How do you feel?
[160:17.81]Um, not good, but not bad either.
[160:20.85]I'm fine.
[160:22.49]I don't think I'm going to want to go for much longer, though.
[160:30.94]A hot dog.
[160:31.64]A hot dog dog with a hot dog in his mouth!
[160:47.05]I like that one.
[160:50.69]Yeah, this one's actually really bad.
[161:00.73]Oh my god, I want that hat!
[161:02.81]There's no hat.
[161:05.96]This is a bot.
[161:09.36]I've paid for bots on my account.
[161:11.51]I'm gonna get fucking thrown off this platform.
[161:29.30]Are you in a hot dog costume too?
[161:31.88]Wow.
[161:36.77]I need one more dog buck.
[161:41.41]Because I want to get the candy pack and see what it looks like.
[161:48.83]What does it look like?
[162:08.34]Bubblegum?
[162:09.02]Wait, I want a better view.
[162:14.10]Bubblegum.
[162:14.86]Oh, that's cool.
[162:16.66]Candy coated.
[162:19.43]Winter.
[162:22.09]Two strip.
[162:23.65]Velvet.
[162:25.57]Let's do the bubblegum filter.
[162:30.27]That does feel like bubblegum.
[162:42.44]So what do you guys think about this photo?

[164:26.13]Oh, you're watching the geysers.
[164:27.31]That's funny.
[164:31.98]Is there even a trash can here?
[164:39.02]Where's the trash?
[165:20.34]I have the same hat.
[165:22.22]Why do you look so sad?
[165:27.22]Um, I don't know where our trash is.
[165:30.06]You'd think there'd be one right here.
[165:47.39]Bottom left?
[165:55.37]That's not a direction.
[166:08.17]It's right here.
[166:09.09]Go left.
[166:15.91]This is just so cute.
[166:16.77]I need a picture of this.
[166:17.49]I don't want to disturb them.
[167:03.49]Out of focus, how do I focus it?
[167:23.80]I can't see any dog outfits.
[167:27.05]I'm your biggest fan.
[167:31.59]Hello there, my little feathered friend.
[167:33.45]This photo is blowing my mind.
[167:45.09]Why?
[167:57.12]You already posted this today.
[167:58.54]What?
[168:01.21]There's one person that wants the dog outfits.
[168:02.99]Hey, when are you gonna do a dog outfit?
[168:07.01]When are you gonna show the dog outfit?
[168:08.35]I want close-ups of dog outfits.
[168:09.73]It's like the person that comes in here every day and says, uh, dude, when are you gonna, when are you gonna play, um, when are you gonna play fucking SCORN again?
[168:22.14]I'm just not gonna.
[168:25.10]When are you gonna play Skyrim?
[168:26.68]I'm waiting for Skyrim.
[168:27.56]Is he playing Skyrim today?
[168:38.02]That's actually cool.
[168:38.54]Alright.
[168:40.20]There's no trash.
[168:41.08]I can't do it.
[168:47.80]I want to go back here to the sunset, right?
[168:52.57]Oh.
[168:53.85]Let's do it.
[168:56.75]Then after this, I'm probably going to take it off.
[168:59.83]I'm starting to... This side of my face is starting to hurt.
[169:09.13]But I had fun.
[169:10.27]I'm glad I could at least straight up a little bit and hang out.
[169:30.55]Drink some tea?
[169:32.69]Nah, I will.
[169:33.37]I'm gonna chill.
[169:36.68]And I'll just keep an eye on the sus.
[169:39.18]If for some reason I get worse, I just will skip tomorrow.
[169:42.93]But I might be fine.
[169:43.99]I don't know.
[169:44.33]We'll see.
[170:11.62]There's a spotted dog who hangs out at Lighthouse Cove after hours.
[170:17.04]You get a close-up photo of her face.
[170:28.77]Look at that.
[170:31.35]Can't you just see text right here being like sunset at the beach or something or whatever town this is or whatever city this is.
[170:40.48]A bad composition?
[170:41.28]No, it is not.
[170:44.46]Like, drifting away with the waves.
[170:46.42]Right there.
[170:47.98]They could sell these for $6 each.
[171:03.24]Alright, does somebody have to take a photo of... Find the Shy Dalmatian.
[171:22.53]I keep forgetting that I'm this weird mascot character.
[171:25.93]I'm probably horrifying.
[171:28.05]Dalmatian?
[171:29.52]Is this Dalmatian?
[172:20.48]Oh, I got it!
[172:21.38]Ow, my head.
[172:22.92]Got it.
[172:43.01]Look at this one.
[172:44.55]Don't tell me this is not a good picture.
[173:01.10]Challenge no dogs.
[173:03.82]Okay, easy.
[173:15.02]Challenge complete.
[173:18.24]There's a dog that sleeps under a boat somewhere in the cove.
[173:22.51]Can you give me a picture of her?
[173:24.29]You'll have to go there at sunset, okay?
[173:27.13]Sleeps under a boat.
[173:28.01]Maybe right here?
[173:37.01]Oh, right here?
[173:45.95]Got it.
[173:46.21]There's one more here.
[173:48.84]There's one of those hidden envelopes.
[174:00.58]On the roof maybe?
[174:01.88]Oh, right here.
[174:10.85]Oh, we didn't have a chance to talk about it, but I was laughing so hard looking at the comments from, uh, the TommyTime stream.
[174:17.62]People were like, that Deadpool was fucking one of the worst things I've ever seen.
[174:21.44]I was laughing my ass off, man.
[174:22.72]Somebody was like, dude, he just is, he's confusing Michelangelo from the Ninja Turtles in Deadpool.
[174:28.98]I was like, oh, actually, kind of makes sense.
[174:31.55]I had a lot of fun.
[174:33.13]I thought it was like a fun, I'll do it again, and I'll fucking do it again.
[174:37.11]I'll do it again.
[174:37.75]I'll put that costume on, and I'll do it again.
[174:44.15]It's funny because I couldn't see the chat really at all because I'm in this costume and I'm not looking over there.
[174:48.81]And I was just having fun pretending to be Deadpool.
[174:54.03]I didn't even care what anybody was even saying.
[175:01.82]People were begging you to stop.
[175:04.42]That's so funny though.
[175:06.52]The fact that people were begging, please stop.
[175:13.85]And I can't see them.
[175:15.48]I have no idea.
[175:22.08]Somebody said, uh, what was it?
[175:23.62]One of them was making me just roll.
[175:26.56]They were like, Charlie's expressions and Charlie's demeanor was like talking to a kid that's dressed up for Halloween.
[175:33.62]Just like, oh yeah, nice job, sweetheart.
[175:36.30]Okay, cool.
[175:37.46]Show him your high kick.
[175:41.64]Like, yeah, show me my high kick.
[175:44.62]It's like a parent.
[175:45.40]It's like a parent that has this kid that's just acting up and just like, okay.
[175:58.32]Nice job, son.
[176:03.12]That was a lot of fun.
[176:05.95]I said it before in the beginning of the stream, but those guys are all awesome.
[176:10.19]That whole group, it was just like a joy to be around.
[176:20.78]He was really calm compared to you.
[176:26.17]Well, he had that unit on his arms.
[176:29.79]That thing was electrocuting him.
[176:43.96]Please do, Lala.
[176:44.56]I already did.
[176:49.55]Oh, wait, everybody has... Wait, you need something.
[176:52.34]You need a toy.
[176:59.08]What is that?
[176:59.74]What happened?
[177:00.92]That was crazy.
[177:07.36]Wow.
[177:11.82]That... Best photo of the whole night.
[177:14.36]Alright, what's this?
[177:16.53]The last objective?
[177:18.58]Take an old-timey photo.
[177:26.33]Okay, so I get a black and white photo.
[177:32.37]Show me your eye kick.
[177:37.57]I just did it.
[177:39.27]I had so much fun, though.
[177:46.26]I'm glad people thought it was fun.
[177:49.82]Alright, black and white.
[178:00.13]The boardwalk is now open late.
[178:02.29]Very cool.
[178:07.33]What is this new emote chain?
[178:09.40]SCORN?
[178:13.97]What is that?
[178:16.39]Dermascorn 1.
[178:19.76]Dermascorn 2?
[178:23.80]What is that?
[178:26.34]Scurn.
[178:30.93]Whoa.
[178:31.39]Whoa.
[178:37.37]That looks cool.
[178:38.27]That actually looks really cool.
[178:47.59]Looks like an old video game.
[178:49.52]Like Myst or something.
[178:53.18]Alright.
[178:53.46]I think I'm going to wrap it up here, guys.
[178:58.41]I'm starting to feel it and I want to make sure I don't stay here too long.
[179:05.53]Hold on.
[179:10.49]So tomorrow, keep an eye on the sus.
[179:12.51]I know the whole schedule got thrown off because of this.
[179:15.73]I'm gonna go chill.
[179:16.85]I'm gonna go take some more of this.
[179:18.27]Take it every four hours.
[179:19.99]Although I really don't like doing that.
[179:21.62]Anybody else get like that?
[179:24.78]Like acetaminophen especially.
[179:25.96]Be careful with it.
[179:26.48]This is not a joke.
[179:28.28]If you take too much acetaminophen in one day, it can actually fuck up your liver.
[179:32.20]So every time it's like, oh, take this every four hours.
[179:33.96]It's like, hmm.
[179:34.64]Maybe I'll do it every six.
[179:41.04]But yeah, I think that's what's making me feel better.
[179:43.40]So we'll see.
[179:44.60]Tomorrow, keep an eye on the sus.
[179:47.56]I would say TBA for now.
[179:49.22]But if I felt okay, then I was going to just go today and I did.
[179:52.60]So the plan tomorrow is I want to play Breath of the Wild again.
[179:57.36]But I also want to do Frog Detective and Neon White.
[180:02.94]And we got a lot of VR going on that next week.
[180:06.63]Pretty much the entire next week from like Wednesday forward is all VR.
[180:14.30]And of course, culminating with the Among Us sus rebranding of the entire channel.
[180:22.76]And I hope you understand I'm selling the fuck out on that stream.
[180:26.56]It's gonna be a joke.
[180:36.33]But yeah.
[180:38.11]We'll do a lot of VR.
[180:40.93]Hopefully this is just something very small, like a head cold or something that just goes away.
[180:44.95]But obviously I'll probably test tomorrow for COVID again.
[180:47.53]And if it's negative, then whatever.
[180:48.73]I just have a cold or whatever.
[180:50.81]But I'll see you guys probably tomorrow.
[180:55.62]Short stream, I know, but I'll see you.
[181:02.60]Let's see what happens tomorrow.
[181:03.74]Keep an eye on Sus.
[181:08.37]Do I have a sore throat?
[181:09.17]Yes, I do.
[181:11.05]It's not that bad, though.
[181:12.07]I can, like, I'm talking for three hours today.
[181:17.80]See you soon, regardless.
[181:20.46]Thanks for watching.
[181:22.22]Thanks for hanging out.
[181:24.76]That was paparazzi.
[181:27.34]That was, like, the perfect game to play, too.
[181:29.23]Just hang out for a few hours.
[181:32.33]Have a great night, guys.
[181:33.49]See you soon.
[181:34.77]Call your mother.
[181:35.21]Take care of yourselves.
[181:42.10]We'll be praying for you.
[181:43.20]I forgot about that.
[181:56.14]Give all energy.
[181:59.94]Give us one more Lala.
[182:02.20]You don't even want me to do this.
[182:03.54]Lala.
[182:06.90]Send positive vibes.
[182:08.50]Pray for me.
[182:09.29]Alright.
[182:11.99]See you guys later.
[182:13.21]Take care.
[182:45.94]Woof, woof, woof, woof.
[183:17.08]you
[183:51.96]you
[184:26.82]you
