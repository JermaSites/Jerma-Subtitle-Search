[00:03.78]Alright.
[00:05.34]Let's like, turn on our facecam.
[00:13.34]Oh, this fucking song is still playing.
[00:19.37]Let's get rid of that.
[00:21.55]That's about enough of that.
[00:24.96]Alright, let me move this.
[00:28.94]This over here, where it belongs.
[00:32.10]Where it belongs.
[00:33.54]Okay, this way.
[00:34.52]Oh, hello there, everybody on the stream.
[00:45.31]I need the chat over here now.
[00:47.15]Wait, wait, wait.
[00:47.63]I've got to make it IRL.
[00:49.03]I've got to make it official.
[00:50.53]Hold on.
[00:50.87]This over here.
[01:01.34]IRL.
[01:02.92]Cool.
[01:08.26]Didn't save game.
[01:11.70]So I'm just here.
[01:13.08]Hi.
[01:13.52]Okay.
[01:28.34]Alright, didn't save game, so it's just me now.
[01:35.43]There.
[01:38.59]Okay.
[01:40.37]Let's move this back here.
[01:41.73]Get this screen captured again.
[01:45.33]Oh, hello there.
[01:49.15]Hi, everybody.
[01:50.07]Yeah.
[01:57.48]I'm not happy right now.
[02:02.48]Jello Thief, thanks for the bits.
[02:04.10]Hey there, Jeremy.
[02:05.94]Me mom thinks that the bugger of $50 to $100 donations are fake and you're bribing people to donate to make us peasants donate the smaller $1 to $10 donations.
[02:17.75]Is this true?
[02:22.69]No.
[02:24.43]No.
[02:25.75]I don't
[02:27.62]I don't.
[02:29.00]I don't.
[02:29.49]You know what I mean?
[02:30.85]Am I growing a beard?
[02:31.59]No, I just have been lazy and haven't shaved.
[02:34.49]Sometimes I do that.
[02:35.31]Sometimes I get lazy.
[02:39.25]Thank you also to Gaming Pug, Jen Betters, and Hyena Dip.
[02:45.28]Bobby Mac also, thank you for the bits.
[02:48.86]I look happy.
[02:49.50]I'm pretty happy.
[02:51.69]I'm not happy right now because obviously all that shit happened.
[02:57.23]All of that was a bunch of bullshit.
[03:01.18]Am I going to go to PAX East?
[03:02.92]Yeah, I go to PAX East every year, guys.
[03:04.94]Every single year because I live around here in the PAX East area.
[03:13.08]Oh!
[03:13.78]Two questions.
[03:14.52]Is there a reason you only mention bits and not subs?
[03:16.74]Yeah, I... Yeah, let's talk about this.
[03:19.97]I might as well.
[03:20.63]This is a fucking IRL stream with, like, my shitty, like, curly Q hair that I have.
[03:28.43]Um... So.
[03:32.47]I'm going to do something where at the end of a stream I think I'm just gonna have, like,
[03:40.62]I don't know how I'm going to do it.
[03:42.48]But I'm going to have like a ticker set up or something at the end of a stream.
[03:45.04]So it's just like, oh, like a very special thanks to these people.
[03:48.02]And I just hit the mic and I'm very sorry.
[03:50.77]I have a thing where it's like a ticker where it's like all the people that subbed and resubbed and how many months that they did.
[03:56.67]If it's possible, I got to try to see if I can get somebody to do it for me.
[04:01.79]But that's the way it's going to be because bits, I will continue to call out bits.
[04:10.39]Cause in my opinion, like a subscription happens every month.
[04:15.11]Right.
[04:15.71]But sometimes somebody pays like a bunch of money, like upfront and is like, Hey, I have a message.
[04:20.82]And it's like fucking 40 bucks.
[04:22.10]You know what I mean?
[04:22.70]That's just like, Holy fuck.
[04:24.06]Like I wouldn't want to, uh, like put that like underneath the rug.
[04:27.48]You know what I mean?
[04:28.98]Um, do it during breaks.
[04:31.06]But the thing is when I, when I take a break, I go pee.
[04:33.06]I'm like going, I'm upstairs, like pissing into a toilet when I take like a break.
[04:36.29]You know what I mean?
[04:40.06]Make that guy getting shot in emote.
[04:42.42]Maybe I will.
[04:43.82]But... I don't want... I'm not gonna lie.
[04:48.30]I'm gonna be very fucking straight with you guys and real with you guys.
[04:52.81]Like, there are enough subs now.
[04:55.49]There are a lot of subscribers now to this channel.
[04:59.61]And I don't ever want to get this channel to a point where it's like... Oh, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[05:05.43]Resub, resub, resub, resub.
[05:06.83]And all I'm doing is calling out names.
[05:09.41]I'd rather just like, I'd rather have like a broadcast be a broadcast and not have to worry about, oh, I got to call out this person's name.
[05:18.51]Did I miss a sub?
[05:20.39]Shit, I missed like three subs.
[05:21.69]You know what I mean?
[05:22.83]I'd rather not do that.
[05:26.58]I'd rather like have the broadcast be, you know, I'd rather pay attention and try to focus on like the stream.
[05:34.28]And I do appreciate everybody that subs.
[05:36.12]I really do.
[05:37.62]But I told you, I don't want to turn into one of those fucking streams where it's just like, Hey, what's going on, man?
[05:46.40]Thanks for the seven months.
[05:48.04]Oh, hey, what's going on?
[05:49.14]By the way, like I'm supposed to be like, there's like, there's something going on on camera right now.
[05:52.69]And I, and I just like blew it.
[05:54.09]You know what I mean?
[05:55.67]Like five, like minutes in a row of just like, Hey, yo subscriber, eight months.
[06:00.59]What up?
[06:01.19]Yeah, I don't, I don't, that's not me.
[06:02.79]That's not the person I am.
[06:04.73]Is there something wrong with that?
[06:05.83]No.
[06:08.28]This is not I don't like some people want to have more of like the the people want to have like more of a stronger like call out kind of connection to like people that are watching and that's not that's not saying I don't want a strong connection with you guys.
[06:23.52]I just
[06:26.20]I just don't want to, long story short, or ramble story short, I would rather just have the stream play.
[06:32.76]I keep fucking touching this microphone.
[06:34.64]I'm going to punch myself in the face.
[06:36.68]Like, in one second.
[06:41.10]But yeah.
[06:43.06]Long story short, it's getting kind of unmanageable.
[06:48.15]And unmanageable, I could manage it for sure, but
[06:53.04]I would rather focus on the streaming and not on like saying names if that makes any sense there you go pay money to watch someone say thanks who pay the money for eight hours yeah it's just I care about like the people watching I just don't
[07:18.31]I come from, listen, I come from YouTube, right?
[07:21.83]I made YouTube videos and while I'm streaming also like these streams are going to be cut up into YouTube videos of most of them at least.
[07:32.28]So if every like 10 seconds or every like 30 seconds, every like minute or two, there was a sub call out.
[07:39.92]editing around these, you know, like, Kalem, for instance, having to, like, edit around these, like, call-out points would kind of be a monumental pain in the ass to, like, make a video from any of these streams.
[07:55.33]Jerma owns YouTube.
[07:56.31]Yeah, I own YouTube.com slash Jerma985 and slash second Jerma.
[08:04.83]I keep like YouTube on the brain when I'm streaming, if that makes any sense.
[08:07.95]Even though I don't even like make, well, that's not, that's not, that's not true.
[08:12.57]It's not true.
[08:17.59]There are a handful of projects that I can't, I have no fucking idea.
[08:24.63]I know that they're being, I know that they're being worked on, but I can't tell you that it's like, hey, check it out next week.
[08:30.84]No.
[08:33.02]Almost said it.
[08:34.02]He almost said that he's not a YouTuber anymore.
[08:40.74]Start whining about revenue.
[08:44.98]Dude, I haven't, like, fucking uploaded a video on my main channel in, like, eight months.
[08:50.26]I don't, like, revenue on YouTube is not something I fucking care about right now.
[08:55.52]Like, making money from YouTube is absolutely at, like, the fucking bottom of the list.
[09:01.30]The absolute bottom.
[09:03.85]I want this stream to be like, here's the thing.
[09:06.41]So here's you got youtube.com slash JeremyStevenson985, right?
[09:11.02]It was doing alright, doing good.
[09:12.16]Okay, cool, cool, cool.
[09:13.48]It's really good.
[09:14.22]Cool.
[09:14.60]Awesome.
[09:15.18]It's at this point here.
[09:16.06]It was like my main source of like income for a while.
[09:19.71]All of a sudden started doing Twitch, started to care about Twitch, started to want the streams to be good, started to want to like put effort into twitch.tv.
[09:25.50]Here we go.
[09:25.92]We've got a little bit of a racer.
[09:26.86]They're coming down.
[09:27.28]They're almost even now.
[09:28.04]Here they are.
[09:28.44]We're like six months into this whole thing.
[09:29.78]We're like fucking a year into this whole thing now.
[09:32.48]And like, this is where they stand.
[09:33.68]Like Twitch is now, I would consider to be more important to me than YouTube.
[09:38.04]It just, that's how it happened.
[09:39.11]You know, that's just the way it is.
[09:43.43]Jeremy Vump.
[09:44.09]I forget.
[09:44.63]It's Jeremy Vump.
[09:48.44]You know what, guys?
[09:49.54]I just fucking forgot my YouTube password.
[09:56.04]I just remembered it.
[09:57.70]Holy shit.
[09:59.52]I just remembered my YouTube password.
[10:01.82]It's coconutwater, A-B-C-D-E-F-G, page up, page down, with one capital, the D in page down.
[10:13.27]Saved it!
[10:17.62]And plus, like, fuck YouTube.
[10:18.98]I'm gonna be real.
[10:19.68]Fuck YouTube.
[10:20.76]Like, let me... Like, really.
[10:24.05]The amount of, like, dumb shit that they've done to that website over the last fucking year and a half.
[10:30.17]It's surprising that, like, people... It's... I'm not... I'm transparent with you guys.
[10:37.52]I'm very transparent.
[10:40.04]YouTube just, like, kept doing things that drove the people making videos away.
[10:47.00]They did.
[10:49.40]They just did.
[10:52.10]It's not like, oh, I can't make any fucking money from you.
[10:54.68]I'm talking about like all the sub bullshit.
[10:56.42]They had like all the sub notification problems.
[10:58.99]They redesigned the site like four times over the course of like fucking five years.
[11:07.41]If you're so transparent, do you eat ass?
[11:09.25]I already answered that question like four months ago.
[11:16.27]I don't like the direction that YouTube took the site.
[11:18.95]They changed like their algorithms.
[11:21.31]They changed like views, like what constitutes as a view.
[11:24.87]They messed around with like all sorts of backend stuff.
[11:28.45]And now it's in a position where I don't think it's, I don't want to use it like as a main platform.
[11:37.19]I like being on Twitch.
[11:38.95]I think Twitch is more fun for me.
[11:40.50]At this point, look, I love making videos.
[11:43.18]And that's why, like, every year you're gonna get on, like, my main, like, channels.
[11:50.00]You're... I'm still gonna make videos.
[11:52.08]I'm just not doing it for my sole purpose of existing anymore.
[11:55.37]It's like, I want to do it because I want to.
[11:57.67]Not because I, like, have to, you know?
[12:00.77]How many bits to make a JermaCraft stream happen?
[12:04.69]Fucking... Zero.
[12:07.27]No, no, no, no, no.
[12:08.11]I mean, like, I mean, I'm not going to do it.
[12:09.31]Don't give me money because like zero, but I don't, not that I'm going to do it for free.
[12:15.88]Not at all.
[12:16.68]Like, I'm going to give you a number that's unobtainable.
[12:19.18]Like 700 million bits is what it would take.
[12:24.00]He'll do it for free.
[12:25.38]That's not what I was saying, but it's okay.
[12:29.06]Wait, somebody else.
[12:30.10]Well, let me see what the question this is.
[12:31.20]Let me look at this question.
[12:33.76]Somebody said that they second this question and I can't see it.
[12:39.37]It's gone.
[12:42.13]It's gone.
[12:45.33]Bill Gates, get in here.
[12:49.75]Make it happen.
[12:50.79]700 billion.
[12:51.31]That's like fucking like $700,000 or something like outrageous.
[12:58.28]So you're telling me there's a chance.
[13:05.20]This is not a comb stream.
[13:06.50]It is not.
[13:09.20]This is just the, I'm, I got really irritated because I forgot to save my game in the fucking game I was streaming.
[13:15.38]And we killed somebody and I went to jail and now I have to stream a facecam for like the next few minutes.
[13:22.32]Just at an end.
[13:25.38]Just to end the stream.
[13:26.64]To take us into the weekend, as you would say.
[13:32.86]Get a Kickstarter fund going.
[13:35.17]That Kickstarter would make like fucking like 68 bucks.
[13:39.03]So don't even, don't even like think about that.
[13:45.29]Make another 3D Movie Maker video.
[13:46.91]I will.
[13:48.85]There are all these things that I want to do.
[13:50.13]I have a million things I want to do.
[13:51.55]I'm just so scatterbrained it's hard to pick one.
[13:57.42]Stream a facecam for 30 minutes is better than three life sentences.
[14:03.99]How unprofessional of not having a comb on comb stream Friday.
[14:09.49]I mean, there's one here.
[14:15.59]Oh, you didn't think there was going to be a comb on this stream.
[14:18.38]Sorry.
[14:20.82]Sorry, there is a comb in this stream.
[14:23.32]You didn't think there was like a brush or a comb at least like fucking 200 feet from me at all times?
[14:30.36]Let's do a little bit of one of these.
[14:31.70]You know what I mean?
[14:32.16]Like,
[14:35.01]Gotta get the right motion.
[14:46.80]That's what I'm talking about.
[14:47.80]Let's get another one.
[14:52.50]It's gone.
[14:55.41]It's just gone.
[14:57.21]It's behind my desk now and I'll never see it again.
[15:02.26]Anyways, this is the content that I subbed for.
[15:11.24]Who's that behind me?
[15:12.02]I don't know.
[15:14.73]Some guy.
[15:16.85]Thank you, Jared Crowder for the $5.
[15:19.75]Hey, Jerry, your jokes really help my depression.
[15:21.57]Love you, bud.
[15:23.55]Thanks for the five bucks, dude.
[15:26.07]Much appreciated.
[15:27.55]Hopefully you feel better.
[15:31.71]I really hope that.
[15:32.58]I really hope and really believe that.
[15:35.96]Insert activity here.
[15:36.84]Thanks for the bits.
[15:38.02]Jermadew shoutouts at the end.
[15:40.06]Yeah.
[15:42.92]That's mine.
[15:43.63]Wait, that was your, Kim, that was your, was it?
[15:46.99]That wasn't part of my like 60 comb pack?
[15:50.59]Ah, whatever.
[15:51.91]We'll get a new one.
[15:52.55]This one will be made out of fucking titanium.
[15:54.05]Don't worry.
[15:55.19]Don't worry.
[15:57.05]Anywho, let's go with the Gaming Pug.
[15:59.77]Thanks for the two bucks.
[16:01.62]So you sit on the toilet and piss into your ass?
[16:05.64]Not in a long time.
[16:08.40]Stormy Chew, thanks for the five dollars.
[16:10.84]Thought what I gave a while ago was all I had.
[16:12.95]Turns out I had more.
[16:13.95]Take it.
[16:17.60]I will take it.
[16:19.80]Then I will say thank you.
[16:20.86]So thank you for the $5, Stormy Chew.
[16:22.52]Appreciate it.
[16:24.51]Angry alien things with the bits.
[16:26.01]Is the snake still on your wall?
[16:27.21]Never found the snake.
[16:27.85]I have no idea.
[16:30.55]Let's see.
[16:32.45]PogChamp Comestream.
[16:33.55]Let's see.
[16:34.53]Let's do a little bit of one of these.
[16:35.97]Let's see.
[16:38.18]How good was it?
[16:39.10]That's pretty good.
[16:42.82]That was a pretty good motion.
[16:44.74]I'm like...
[16:47.56]That was... Wow.
[16:51.70]Wow.
[16:52.16]I mean, like, holy shit.
[16:55.82]That, like, got me going.
[16:57.88]In more than one way.
[17:02.57]Snake is dead.
[17:03.03]The snake is still out there.
[17:05.69]What was the game you said you had for next?
[17:07.23]It's another FMV... It's another full motion video game.
[17:11.49]It's SWAT.
[17:12.67]Police Quest SWAT.
[17:13.73]And this one, SWAT is a little more...
[17:17.21]Less, it's a lot less like detective work and just like random police like breachings.
[17:23.77]And apparently it seems like it's going to be pretty insane.
[17:27.93]So I didn't want to start doing that and stop doing that in like 20 minutes or 30 minutes because I'm going to be out of here very, very soon actually.
[17:37.67]Let's see here.
[17:39.09]Yeah, I got to get going in the next like 15 minutes or so.
[17:44.07]So we got about 15 to 20 minutes for me to hang out.
[17:48.53]Have I ever done a speedrun of something?
[17:50.09]No.
[17:50.35]The closest thing I could say that I've ever done a speedrun of was... I mean, honestly, maybe like Super Mario RPG because I beat the game or Chrono Trigger because I beat the game so many times that I just wanted to like go through them again very quickly, but not like timed or anything.
[18:12.13]Kane Lynch 2 was, yeah, that was last night.
[18:15.69]Do I have ADHD?
[18:16.49]Yes.
[18:17.27]Very, very badly.
[18:19.49]I got diagnosed with ADHD when I was like 14 or 15 or something.
[18:25.41]And I still got it.
[18:26.91]It's still here.
[18:30.01]When's my birthday?
[18:30.80]It's 22nd, September 22nd.
[18:35.52]Play Mountain Blade.
[18:36.28]You know, I've been told to play Mountain Blade like so many times.
[18:41.62]They're like fucking over 2,000 people here.
[18:43.72]I want to hear every single person's response.
[18:46.86]Is Mountain Blade a series that would actually be fun for me to stream?
[18:52.66]Would I be into that game or is that going to be a situation where I play it for 30 minutes and I stop immediately?
[19:04.03]I'm seeing a lot of yeses.
[19:08.30]Alright, this time I didn't really get it.
[19:11.70]I didn't really understand what you guys were saying.
[19:14.30]Emotes only, please.
[19:15.68]I can't, I mean, I'm seeing a lot of things start with the letter N and some of these words are starting with the letter Y. I can't, I need to know from, yes and no, I need to know from emotes.
[19:27.03]I don't understand.
[19:31.95]That actually makes it much easier because I can see like the greens and reds.
[19:34.38]Okay.
[19:37.20]Okay.
[19:39.05]Okay.
[19:42.03]I think I understand.
[19:44.01]Yep.
[19:46.01]So yes, apparently it is.
[19:48.57]Except like 42 of you said no.
[19:57.84]I'm sorry.
[19:58.78]Mods, I am sorry.
[20:00.04]Sometimes it happens.
[20:00.78]What's even going on?
[20:01.57]I don't know.
[20:02.76]We're trying to kill like 15 minutes.
[20:06.64]But yeah.
[20:09.36]I have actually... No, never mind, never mind.
[20:14.72]Not worth saying.
[20:15.49]I'm not going to say that because that's like... That's a secret.
[20:18.83]That's a fucking secret.
[20:20.93]And you're not going to know what that secret is until the secret happens.
[20:23.43]Where's my comb?
[20:25.67]Alright.

[21:29.15]You guys all have it out for me for some reason.
[21:34.75]He absorbs the humidity and grows it.
[21:38.24]Oh, Gummy Monk, thank you for the $5.
[21:39.62]You should try Mountain Blade on your own.
[21:41.22]If you enjoy the combat, you'll like the game as a whole.
[21:42.96]If not, you will hate it with a passion.
[21:45.06]Well, thank you for the honest response.
[21:47.14]And thank you also for giving me $5.
[21:50.35]Thank you.
[21:51.31]That's very much appreciated.
[21:53.23]Maybe I will try it at some point.
[21:57.84]Uh, Pajigalow, I can't... Every time I see your name, I'm gonna call you, I'm gonna call you Paggy.
[22:04.47]I'm gonna call you Peggy.

[22:10.83]Uh, Jeremy, stream Mountain Blade, I swear you'll love it.
[22:12.72]Well, we've got two back-to-back answers that we're contradicting.
[22:15.78]So, please stream it.
[22:17.54]Don't stream it.
[22:19.26]But, we'll see.
[22:24.00]Canjams, thanks for the bits.
[22:25.09]Hey Jerma, I've been watching for about five years.
[22:27.09]Loved every second of it.
[22:27.89]Keep up the great work.
[22:28.57]You've got me through some tough times.
[22:29.81]Thanks for being a great guy.
[22:31.81]Much love.
[22:32.25]Well, thank you so much, Canjams.
[22:33.73]I appreciate that.
[22:35.41]I'm glad you enjoy yourself here.
[22:36.89]Because I don't plan on going anywhere.
[22:41.15]Play Arma 3 on stream.
[22:42.75]I actually wanted to do... What was that weird life roleplay thing?
[22:47.59]I thought about doing that a long time ago and I just decided...
[22:51.06]To never do it.
[22:52.68]But I wanted to.
[22:55.05]But thank you, Angry Alien, for the two bucks.
[23:02.23]Uh... Who else?
[23:03.49]Ghoulchamp, thanks for the bits.
[23:05.53]This person's name is just a smash on a keyboard.
[23:08.64]It's just like... But, uh, thank you.
[23:13.00]I'm gonna call you Deesoid.
[23:14.38]Thank you for the $15.
[23:14.88]Followed you since your TF2 days.
[23:18.36]I'd like to say... And then he mashed his keyboard again.
[23:23.32]Again.
[23:23.58]Ahem.
[23:29.32]Ahem.
[23:32.18]Let me redo that one.
[23:33.90]Hey Jerm, if all of you since you're T have two days, I'd like to say, uh, mash my face on the keyboard.
[23:39.18]Yeah, see?
[23:40.02]It's okay.
[23:40.98]Everybody's gonna make fun of me now.
[23:45.67]Fucking voice crack.
[23:46.49]I'm fucking in my goddamn thirties.
[23:49.13]Look, when you talk, I've been live for three hours and sixteen minutes.
[23:53.59]When you talk for over three hours straight, without really stopping, sometimes you get a little hoarse, and that's why you got a fucking pink lemonade.
[24:06.85]Do some voices.
[24:11.20]What was that kind of answer?
[24:15.36]Thank you, Malaria, for the bits.
[24:17.94]Deathlinger, thanks for the bits.
[24:22.26]What else we got?
[24:22.84]Alright, we got about... We've got... 10 minutes until I end the stream.
[24:24.64]Blood Lemonade.
[24:37.87]You want me to down this?
[24:40.73]Why do you automatically assume this is, like, hard to drink?
[24:45.01]It's like, hold on a second.
[24:49.93]This fucking pink lemonade is... Oh my god, it's so delicious and sweet and tangy, like a perfect summer drink.
[25:01.31]Look at my hands.
[25:11.28]GTA 5 RP stream.
[25:13.44]That's another thing I wanted to do.
[25:15.23]That is another thing I wanted to do.
[25:21.37]Oh, he actually did it.
[25:25.93]Shirtless stream.
[25:26.59]No.
[25:27.75]You're not getting a fucking shirtless stream from me.
[25:29.48]You're going to have to.
[25:30.40]That's big money.
[25:32.88]Shirtless stream is big money.
[25:34.72]And you want to know what big money is?
[25:36.96]Stack about this high.
[25:40.31]Once.

[26:09.44]Sir Feline, thanks for the $15.
[26:10.38]And thanks to this guy for subbing!
[26:15.29]Fuck, I shouldn't have done that, because now I... No, but thank you for subscribing, for real.
[26:19.41]But I just... You guys, we already talked about it.
[26:22.07]You don't even know.
[26:23.57]Sir Feline, thanks for the $15.
[26:25.60]No more comb.
[26:26.60]I lost it at the root behind the desk.
[26:28.62]It's gone.
[26:31.05]It's pretty reasonably priced Game said thanks for the bits been watching since the facecam fortress days.
[26:37.29]Oh, that's a long time ago.
[26:38.95]I know it's dead But the Dr. Pepper joke will always live on in my heart.
[26:43.10]You guys really remember that shit Like one of my sticks as a YouTuber was like hey look I drink soda You know I mean like hey look I drink a soda that's like a popular soda brand
[26:58.21]And I say it like I'm from Boston, because I'm from that area.
[27:04.89]It was fun, though.
[27:05.55]You know, it was fun.
[27:06.49]I liked it.
[27:06.99]I had fun.
[27:09.40]I loved it, too.
[27:09.98]I'm not saying I didn't love it.
[27:10.84]I'm just saying that's like... Think back.
[27:14.46]The soda sprint.
[27:18.26]What game made me the most queasy that I've ever played?
[27:22.27]Uh...
[27:28.67]I don't know.
[27:28.93]I don't, like, get queasy from games.
[27:30.77]That doesn't... I don't get, like, queasy.
[27:35.76]It's really nothing.
[27:37.94]Maybe something in... Maybe something... Maybe, like... Alright, the part in Outlast when... Like, queasy as in, like, oh, I'm gonna, like, throw up because of, like, I don't like the way that the game is designed or queasy as in, like, gore, scary, like, fucked up imagery.
[28:00.57]Because I mean, I get like, queasy playing some games.
[28:06.24]Ugh, speaking of queasy.
[28:09.92]Uh, in general, probably like the part in Outlast when you're like, I'm not gonna be, I'm not gonna give you details, but when you're lying like this, and there's like, there's something right there sticking out, and like, you think that it's just gonna get like fucking ripped off.
[28:23.02]That part was just like, ugh, it was horrible.
[28:28.08]Bubsy.
[28:28.50]Bubsy probably also was just Bubsy 3D.
[28:32.78]Is there a way to watch full past streams?
[28:34.96]For 60 days after a stream, you can just watch them for free down there somewhere.
[28:40.73]Or no, actually like up here.
[28:42.35]You click this like videos tab and then it'll take you to a page where you can watch them.
[28:51.65]Scariest thing I've ever played?
[28:53.01]It probably was like probably was Outlast.
[28:58.14]Outlast was fucking just horrible.
[29:00.94]It's so nerve-wracking.
[29:06.05]Somebody just gave five, Corn on the Rob just gave five bucks.
[29:11.29]And they say, Jerma, hey Jerma, I was wondering if you're still on the strict diet of coffee and two other items that begin with the letter C. Very strict.
[29:26.34]Very strict indeed.
[29:30.32]SCP was fucking crazy.
[29:31.66]That was a long time ago, though.
[29:34.88]That was a long time ago.
[29:35.98]Alright, we got more time.
[29:38.94]I'm about to end the stream here.
[29:42.00]Alright.
[29:42.52]Alright, guys and girls.
[29:46.67]I said it.
[29:47.21]I was, like, reading the donation message, and I just, like, said the first word of the alphabet of the sea, and that was it.
[29:58.53]I do drink coffee every day, so...
[30:02.98]Have you played any of the other Resident Evil games?
[30:04.88]I have.
[30:05.16]I played all of them.
[30:06.56]Resident Evil 7 was fantastic until you got to like the like 60% of the way through the game and then it became a terrible piece of shit game and then like the last like fucking 40 minutes of Resident Evil 7 were pretty good.
[30:20.37]So like yeah.
[30:26.24]Do I still play WoW?
[30:28.08]No.
[30:29.00]I have not played WoW since patch 7.1.
[30:32.22]And I didn't even, uh... I didn't even really play in 7.1.
[30:38.13]I stopped playing World of Warcraft after the catastrophe that was the Karazhan stream.
[30:44.52]That was 7.1.
[30:44.84]That was 7.1.
[30:47.50]I'm not, I shit you not, corroborate that story with anybody that I know that knows that I played that game.
[30:52.94]Talk to Boo, talk to Etalyx, talk to Stealth, talk to fucking Star, anybody that knew that I fucking played that game.
[31:00.27]And after the 7.1 launch day Karazhan stream, I never opened the fucking game ever again.
[31:08.06]Etalyx is in the chat, corroborate it with him.
[31:14.05]Why was that stream so bad?
[31:15.63]Because MLC Stealth was, like, had, like, the flu, and he was, like, puking and burping and, like, making all these cough noises every 10 seconds.
[31:22.87]We got, like, kicked out.
[31:23.77]I thought, like, we were gonna have a group of five.
[31:25.31]We didn't.
[31:26.19]I was, like, launch day Karazhan.
[31:27.57]I was so excited for it.
[31:28.53]We had to get in a group of, like, random fucking people.
[31:30.73]That stream was, like, nine hours long.
[31:32.89]That was a nine fucking hour long stream.
[31:35.33]It was, like, at least eight hours.
[31:37.71]We had to get, like, attuned to Karazhan.
[31:41.10]And, like, that was, like, fucking four hours.
[31:43.30]That was such a pain in the ass.
[31:44.00]It was so boring.
[31:45.32]And then, like, we got into Karazhan, and MLC Stealth, like, had to leave within the first, like, fucking 20 minutes of actually, like, five hours had gone by.
[31:54.03]Stealth gets in.
[31:54.91]He has to fucking leave.
[31:56.25]He goes, like, and then, like, fucking ends and leaves the TeamSpeak.
[32:01.23]And then I was sitting there with a bunch of random people that were not even communicating, wiping at the same boss for, like, fucking two hours.
[32:12.20]So I quit the game.
[32:13.56]Forever.
[32:15.76]Literally forever.
[32:16.54]I never played it again.
[32:20.94]That is a straight up... Like, I was internally screaming.
[32:23.60]You know when you're internally fucking screaming at something?
[32:29.27]I was screaming on the inside.
[32:34.03]Like, you know when you can just feel the fucking... The fire brewing down here?
[32:39.27]Where you're just like...
[32:42.43]I just want this to not be here.
[32:44.59]I want this to be over.
[32:47.35]But I was on stream and I couldn't like fucking freak out because I don't want to get on one of those like freak out reddits.
[32:52.65]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[32:54.81]Streamer freaks out and fucking screams and like his face turns red and he ends the stream.
[32:59.37]I don't want to be on like Reddit.com slash rgamerfreakouts because you know I would be there.
[33:12.75]Wow, current context, content.
[33:14.75]Wait, wait, wait.
[33:15.37]What did you say?
[33:17.01]Bullshromp, thanks for the $10, first of all.
[33:19.11]But then you said, current content sucks.
[33:21.99]Just fish in Howling Fjord.
[33:23.81]Oh, God.
[33:31.93]Gamer freakout.
[33:35.33]R slash comb thrower.
[33:38.73]Alright.
[33:41.24]I gotta make my exit.
[33:42.86]It's about three and a half hours.
[33:46.92]I am upset if you were not here earlier.
[33:49.78]And you don't know why I'm upset.
[33:53.14]But those of you that are here know why I'm upset.
[33:55.18]And why... I mean... You all know what happened at the end of that game.
[34:00.66]And it was fucking... It was getting there.
[34:02.00]We were getting there and...
[34:05.88]It sucked.
[34:07.12]Anyways, before I go, Mystic Player, thanks for the bits.
[34:10.70]I'm from the EU, so it's hard to watch you.
[34:12.66]Like a year ago, I saw one of your old YouTube videos, and since then I watch all your VODs.
[34:17.42]Keep good work and thanks for entertainment.
[34:20.67]Well, thank you, Mr. Player.
[34:23.31]If you can only watch the VODs, then I'm just happy that you can at least watch on your own time.
[34:31.16]I always feel so bad about starting my streams at like 5 to 7, like 6 o'clock, 7, 8 o'clock Eastern Time, like evening Eastern Time, right?
[34:41.89]But that's like when I'm the most active though, like I don't usually stream I don't have like the amount of energy that I have during a Like a morning broadcast in Eastern Time United States.
[34:53.02]I just can't do it.
[34:54.30]I just wouldn't be into it I wouldn't be able to do it.
[34:56.84]So unfortunately like 6 to like 8 p.m Eastern Time is like my prime time for like awake and alertness usually so Sorry, I like I wish I could do more like early streams.
[35:10.24]I
[35:11.51]But I can't.
[35:12.41]But thank you so much for the support.
[35:13.54]I appreciate it.
[35:16.52]And that's it.
[35:19.46]Thank you.
