[ve:60.16.100]

[00:06.35]That looks like it's coming through.
[00:07.91]Look at that.
[00:16.41]One second.
[00:48.07]Why is that only coming through one speaker, though?
[00:50.17]That's what I want to know.
[00:53.15]That's confusing.
[00:58.64]Reset it.
[01:02.18]Because you guys can hear this, right?
[01:03.88]But it's only coming through one speaker.
[01:07.08]That seems like it shouldn't be happening.
[01:09.82]Oh, well.
[01:12.46]I can't hear anything, though.
[01:13.58]Okay.
[01:18.56]Over here come on what a mess what a fucking mess So what's going on why is this only coming through one ear surround sound right here I'm not getting any sound at all.
[01:39.31]Oh Hold on this is why give me one
[02:12.37]Weird.
[02:13.71]I'm going to have to mix this town to something else.
[02:15.85]Hold on.
[02:16.19]There we go.
[02:21.53]Does that sound absolutely fucking terrible?
[02:28.65]We'll find out.
[02:29.35]Oh, shit.
[02:37.02]I can't even hear.
[02:37.60]I can't even see chat now.
[02:39.74]Hold on.
[02:49.24]Oh my lord.
[02:49.94]Give me a break.
[02:51.08]Why?
[02:51.40]It's like taking over my computer.
[02:54.26]Oh, you fucking stupid thing.
[02:59.82]At least you guys get to enjoy this fucking music while I get angry at old 30-year-old technology.
[03:07.88]Just a typical day, don't worry.
[03:13.53]I'm gonna love a god.
[03:19.48]all good it's all good alright we're going you can't hear it I'm gonna I'm gonna turn it up don't worry I'll turn it up if you're not using the gun con why not use the PlayStation 3 to play these what do you mean
[03:49.06]PlayStation 3.
[03:53.54]Was Point Blank on PS3 with a gun con?
[03:58.51]I am not the only person to play this game.
[04:00.01]This game is a classic.
[04:00.91]Alright, here we go.
[04:05.23]There was so many.
[04:06.35]I had to change like three resolutions.
[04:10.13]Sorry, that took a fucking thousand years.
[04:11.42]Alright, let's do it.
[04:15.06]PS3 games play... Well, that's if you have an old PS3, right?
[04:20.24]All PS3.
[04:21.14]I thought backwards compatibility wasn't in the newer PlayStation 3s.
[04:25.82]It has native PS1 support.
[04:27.40]What?
[04:33.82]Yeah, not Light Gun, though.
[04:37.09]I need an old TV.
[04:38.21]I'm playing right now.
[04:39.21]Wait, what's going on?
[04:42.87]Did the game just start?
[04:47.15]What?
[04:48.63]Just throw a grenade?
[04:51.37]How do I shoot the gun?
[04:56.50]Like that, okay.
[04:59.84]I remember this was one of my favorite PlayStation 1 games.
[05:06.52]I loved this game.
[05:10.77]Now we can see that, uh, you just look back and you see just the difference.
[05:19.11]Game's still kind of quiet.
[05:20.77]There's nothing I can really do about it at the moment.
[05:23.03]There is a light gun portion of this game that we were talking about before, but I can't do it, unfortunately.
[05:35.42]This music is so bad, too.
[05:37.35]Awful music.
[05:42.35]Was he right-handed?
[05:43.57]Wait, you mean was... What was his name?
[05:46.89]John Connor?
[05:51.24]Looks like I'm trying to open my eyes underwater.
[06:04.99]That's perfect.
[06:06.69]Let me go down here.
[06:07.61]Yeah, there's three games in one here, guys.
[06:11.06]Just you wait.
[06:14.86]Let me get in the elevator.
[06:18.76]How do I get in?
[06:21.07]Oh, I just exploded.
[06:23.45]Oh, whoops.
[06:26.35]I think he just hit the shooter, buddy.
[06:27.83]That's Detective John Connor.
[06:36.50]Oh, okay, I gotta save that person.
[06:38.74]What is this?
[06:41.10]You know one of my favorite PlayStation 1 games that I was gonna get, but... I figured it was just too late.
[06:47.28]You guys ever played Loaded?
[06:48.76]That top-down game?
[06:50.89]That game was... very, very, very bloody.
[06:54.51]It's like an original top-down PlayStation 1 shooter.
[07:01.31]How do I beat this level?
[07:02.35]Detective John Denver.
[07:12.99]Hostage escaped, alright.
[07:16.46]Wait, oh, sh- no, no, no, okay.
[07:19.64]What, run towards the elevator?
[07:22.67]Okay, I want to play one of the other three games.
[07:31.19]Oh, I thought the guy had a dog.
[07:35.53]That's not a dog.
[07:36.19]That is... Grenades?
[07:42.77]Oh no, those are good guys.
[07:43.61]Okay.
[07:47.41]Is this open now?
[07:48.17]Can I leave?
[07:53.53]I forget how you beat this game.
[07:56.61]I don't think there is a beat this game.
[08:02.46]We have to at least see the next part.
[08:08.40]Alright, I'm dead.
[08:10.94]Alright, so... Now what?
[08:18.47]Oh, that's it.
[08:22.11]What the hell is going on?
[08:25.65]McClane did well.
[08:29.37]What is going on?
[08:29.95]I have to... I have to take... Oh, shit.
[08:33.22]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[08:34.00]Go back.
[08:42.38]Oh, it was M. Here we go.
[08:49.56]You didn't say the F word.
[08:53.62]Here we go.
[08:54.10]Jim.
[08:55.80]They all had first names anyways.
[08:56.98]Alright, Die Hard.
[09:00.18]How do I get to the other Die Hards?
[09:03.42]This is a trilogy on here.
[09:11.68]Where's the trilogy?
[09:13.32]There's three games on this disk.
[09:14.68]That's what it told me.
[09:15.38]There we go.
[09:22.11]Die Harder.
[09:29.18]The F word wasn't invented until 2003.
[09:34.78]I didn't get scammed.
[09:35.66]This is a PlayStation 1 greatest hits.
[09:42.67]This is the light gun game.
[09:45.27]That I have to use the cursor to shoot now.
[09:50.32]Here it is.
[09:50.68]Are you ready?
[09:56.03]Boy What am I need to do I remember playing this is that a bad guy how do you reload that I can't shoot off-screen Major disaster, what's freaky load?
[10:17.52]Okay, it's r2
[10:25.69]I do remember loving this game.
[10:28.33]This game was a lot of fun.
[10:29.29]These people just run out on fire.
[10:32.96]I have a machine gun now, that's good.
[10:46.01]How would you be able to even use the light gun with this?
[10:49.41]You can't even see.
[10:54.73]There's health in here.
[10:55.63]Get the health!
[11:01.03]This is kind of giving me an headache.
[11:04.17]Can I get the grenade?
[11:08.03]Get the health!
[11:08.43]Get the health!
[11:12.38]Yeah, uh, we're gonna... we're gonna be moving away from this one very soon.
[11:15.50]I think this is... I'm gonna throw up.
[11:26.25]Oh, I just shot a ro- Okay, that's how you shoot rockets.
[11:30.88]How many rockets do I have?
[11:38.66]It's like the Beretta.
[11:41.76]We're almost done.
[11:43.20]Don't worry, I promise we're almost done.
[11:53.74]The arcade beat-em-up Die Hard is a fantastic game.
[11:58.40]Here's the problem, though.
[12:00.14]I don't think that is... I think you have to import a PS1 from Japan to play that one.
[12:05.64]But on Dreamcast, which is what we're going to be doing soon here, Dynamite Cop is the sequel to that game.
[12:11.95]They just didn't call it Die Hard 2.
[12:13.63]It's the same game.
[12:19.17]I'm surprised I'm still doing this well.
[12:25.06]Tracing bullets now.
[12:30.58]Shotgun?
[12:34.46]Classic headache, yeah.
[12:40.32]I can't even see.
[12:42.14]Oh man.
[12:53.58]I wish that- I want this to be over.
[12:55.84]But I can't stop playing it.
[12:59.20]How did the car get in here?
[13:02.78]Ugh.
[13:06.44]Secret route.
[13:07.62]Rockets, rockets, rockets, huh?
[13:10.68]Did I do something to get a secret?
[13:16.22]How do I do, uh, the grenade?
[13:18.06]That's how.
[13:23.08]This game is pain.
[13:25.46]It kind of is.
[13:32.97]Full health again, somehow.
[13:44.54]They don't give a shortage of weapons, that's for sure.
[13:48.98]Change the title?
[13:49.66]Oh, we're probably going to be done with the stream here after this.
[13:55.29]I need to take a PlayStation Break.
[14:00.55]What is that?
[14:01.93]Is it... Oops.
[14:05.11]Because there really is something to be said.
[14:08.72]There is only so long you can look at this before your eyes fall down.
[14:13.56]Your eyes trip in your skull.
[14:16.22]And they fall in the back of your throat and go all the way down.
[14:26.37]I feel like I could have done a better job than that.
[14:35.21]Somebody on that dev team could have made a much better screen.
[14:37.94]I understand budget constraints and everything, but... Really?
[14:46.82]The best you got is...
[15:00.84]They probably could have taken five minutes to do a better one.
[15:03.02]Don't miss that.
[15:03.56]That guy's got a machine gun.
[15:06.41]I think this is the boss.
[15:21.96]I couldn't even tell what that was.
[15:24.58]Apparently that was a boss.
[15:25.67]That was the head honcho.
[15:33.09]Yippee ki-yay.
[15:37.91]Nice.
[15:38.29]20, 30, 40, 50, 60%, 70%.
[15:48.91]95% of terrorists killed.
[15:51.79]And innocents saved.
[15:54.09]Sif.
[15:55.23]Half.
[15:57.14]McClane health.
[15:58.14]Okay, we're good.
[15:58.76]Oh, here comes level 2.
[16:04.50]It looks like me.
[16:09.30]That was me.
[16:09.85]That's me right there.
[16:12.37]Somebody rewind that.
[16:15.37]That was as if I did an emote face.
[16:28.74]I want, I want to zoom and enhance on that one.
[16:30.54]Uh-oh, what do you, what's uh-oh for?
[16:46.57]Oh, look out, another Twitch emote just ran by!
[16:55.06]Twitch resolution on their emotes is probably higher.
[17:05.87]I almost don't want to shoot them to see their faces.
[17:11.16]It actually is.
[17:11.94]Who's that?
[17:13.70]What streamer is that?
[17:28.96]Same thing?
[17:29.46]No, that guy's gone.
[17:30.50]WHOA!
[17:31.02]Oh, who we got here?
[17:42.55]That was a different guy.
[17:44.39]Where are you skiing to, man?
[17:47.31]That guy just... What the fuck are you doing?
[17:51.77]What?
[17:52.23]Oh shit, I'm dead!
[17:57.20]Oh, oh well.
[17:59.30]It was worth it.
[18:01.68]Let's take a look at the third camp.
[18:11.03]More than half.
[18:12.67]Ooh.
[18:14.89]Oh.
[18:15.93]Five.
[18:16.19]We got five civilians.
[18:17.23]That's okay.
[18:17.55]Alright, put a name in.
[18:23.53]How long can the name be?
[18:29.24]Alright, come on, I got, wait, I got, I got 34 seconds.
[18:31.25]Can I, I got, can I do it?
[18:32.31]Can I do it?
[18:32.63]I'm gonna try as hard as I can to do this.
[18:39.11]Go back.
[18:42.91]Come on, where's T?
[18:43.81]T, T, T, come on!
[18:51.46]Come on!
[18:58.86]Come on, O!
[19:02.76]Come on!
[19:05.10]Shit, I can't do it!
[19:13.32]I thought I could do a... Whatever, who cares.
[19:18.25]I was trying to do May the Force Be With You as a send-off.
[19:25.67]Oh, yes, I had to shift!
[19:28.40]Let's do the last game.
[19:30.94]And call it a day.
[19:31.82]Haha.
[19:39.79]Those were really long seconds.
[19:44.83]Why am I getting haha'd right now?
[19:46.23]What did I do?
[19:47.86]Is that somebody doing a Ben Affleck?
[19:49.32]No, Ben?
[19:49.66]What's his name?
[19:50.72]No, this is a driving game.
[19:52.20]This should be fun.
[19:52.92]He said it.
[20:19.17]Bruce Will- I know it's Bruce Willis, I'm just being stupid.
[20:22.75]Just messing around.
[20:26.12]Ben F- Ben Affleck.
[20:29.04]We made a Geico reference earlier.
[20:32.54]Three lives left.
[20:35.00]How does one drive the car?
[20:43.78]Oh my god.
[20:46.34]It's first person?
[20:48.29]Why is it first person?
[20:54.03]Oh my fucking god.
[21:01.85]I don't even know where I went.
[21:03.35]Does my car have damage?
[21:19.14]What the fuck?
[21:21.92]How do I do the super speed?
[21:28.90]Oh, there we go.
[21:29.52]Okay, now I can see.
[21:34.16]Revolving?
[21:36.26]What do you mean revolving?
[21:39.40]I've lost all sense of direction here.
[21:41.59]I'm not sure what's going on.
[21:48.09]Okay.
[21:49.81]I think I have to go over here.
[21:50.79]We have one life left.
[21:56.56]Who's dropping like a nuke on New York?
[21:58.40]What the hell is going on?
[21:59.50]Alright, here we go.
[22:03.90]Follow the rainbow.
[22:06.98]What do I do about this?
[22:12.96]Oh, I think I have to get rid of... I have to get rid of those.
[22:26.50]Oh, I don't... They all have the same thing.
[22:34.65]They all go... Even the pedestrian.
[22:41.24]Get out of the fucking way.
[22:47.16]Oh, there it was!
[22:51.52]What is this?
[22:51.90]What do I have to do?
[22:55.19]Okay, I have to ram it.
[22:56.55]Extra time.
[23:02.63]Extra computer time.
[23:05.04]That's right.
[23:08.30]Every time I pick up one of those, I get ten more minutes on the computer.
[23:20.83]Got it.
[23:25.72]Mom tells me, as long as I do my homework.
[23:27.70]I can play math blasters for another 40 minutes.
[23:35.57]Oh, I missed the two turbos.
[23:37.41]Shit.
[23:40.63]Wouldn't this still kill everybody here?
[23:42.69]Yeah, like that person was just trying to get away.
[23:44.72]Bomb car.
[23:47.49]It's a bomb car now.
[23:49.33]Oh, there.
[23:50.01]How do I get rid of it?
[23:51.69]What am I supposed to do?
[23:54.41]No, not rip the fucking wheel.
[23:56.03]Oh my god.
[23:58.13]Jesus!
[24:01.49]Come on!
[24:04.42]Why?
[24:10.36]There he is.
[24:14.22]Come on, give me that extra computer time!
[24:19.34]Time!
[24:19.96]Got it.
[24:23.48]Oh, you... I hate that.
[24:25.00]I hate it.
[24:28.64]Time.
[24:30.22]There it is.
[24:30.54]I got...
[25:03.05]Well, okay, hip.
[25:05.85]We're real hip.
[25:12.76]Well, and with that, we are... I can do this.
[25:20.88]I at least wanna just get rid of the bomb car.
[25:23.68]I really do feel like I am able to, I can complete this.
[25:31.77]Just don't waste any time.
[25:34.69]I want to see what happens when I do the bomb car.
[25:40.59]Straight ahead.
[25:41.13]It's probably time for a turbo.
[25:48.21]No.
[25:49.73]Not necessary.
[25:51.91]Can you get out of the way?
[25:52.74]Why do you have to be just right in my way?
[25:58.08]Why would you walk across at that point?
[26:01.50]There were so many other places you could have walked.
[26:03.94]There were 12 cars there.
[26:11.14]I think now is a good time for me to cross the street.
[26:13.08]Alright, let's turbo this up a little bit.
[26:17.55]Alright.
[26:26.18]Last one and then the bomb cars over here Okay, I'm getting I I turned around again There it is alright here it comes bomb car step on it I
[26:55.14]That actually just helped me, thanks guys.
[27:05.59]I'm concentrating so hard here.
[27:08.05]What was that?
[27:09.95]Oh, was it the bomb car?
[27:10.79]No, here's the bomb car.
[27:14.19]So do I bump him?
[27:17.09]I think I'm supposed to bump the bomb car.
[27:21.20]I am.
[27:27.21]You're gonna- nope.
[27:30.67]Slow down, slow down!
[27:33.87]What?!
[27:36.07]Back it up!
[27:41.29]Where's it showing?!
[27:42.29]Get back in the fucking front- oh my god.
[27:44.99]Dumb game.
[27:56.75]Oh my god.
[27:59.15]It's alright.
[28:00.61]I'd rather be in first person.
[28:05.33]You can't bump him more than once in a second, so you have to bump him and then go, bump him and then go.
[28:08.79]Oh.
[28:12.80]Man.
[28:15.30]OH.
[28:15.88]MAN.
[28:18.96]Why do I care about this more than anything tonight?
[28:29.12]Ah, that's bumpin'!
[28:30.34]That's bumpin' the car!
[28:32.72]No it ain't, don't worry, I didn't bump the car more than like fuckin' 30 times right there.
[28:47.26]Last chance.
[28:53.22]Alright, now let him get ahead of me.
[28:54.64]Bump him again.
[28:56.73]Oh, you fucking dumb mother of all that is sacred.
[29:08.28]Give me some time.
[29:08.96]I got there at a time.
[29:13.48]Double time.
[29:14.82]Right on his ass.
[29:18.04]That was a hard time.
[29:21.33]Sorry, I got plenty of time.
[29:24.84]There he goes.
[29:27.29]Got it!
[29:28.15]I did it!
[29:29.47]I beat the game.
[29:34.29]What are we doing now?
[29:39.08]I don't understand.
[29:40.54]Didn't I get rid of the bomb car?
[29:45.16]I thought it wanted me to go to the garage!
[29:50.98]Oh, come on!
[29:52.61]New car!
[29:55.21]Get the new car!
[29:57.88]Get the new car!
[30:04.76]Well, that's it apparently.
[30:06.40]I got the new car.
[30:07.42]We ditched the old one and it exploded.
[30:09.32]Wasn't I trying to get rid of the fucking bombs?
[30:18.93]Well, I... Oh my god.
[30:22.53]I just killed so many people.
[30:23.65]That was not cool.
[30:29.09]I thought I was trying to save the world.
[30:34.86]Yeah, I guess I kind of am.
[30:42.24]Was that just money?
[30:44.58]Subway.
[30:45.12]I think we made it to a level completion bonus.
[30:50.81]Safety margin.
[30:55.37]Citizen saved for car damage.
[30:59.29]I don't know what that means.
[31:02.69]Last chance.
[31:03.39]What am I looking at on the bottom there?
[31:06.41]Um, yeah.
[31:07.87]This makes perfect sense.
[31:12.35]I can't see a damn thing.
[31:14.87]I'm not sure.
[31:15.49]Am I racing this guy?
[31:20.53]Why is it showing me a Super Mario Kart SNES version?
[31:27.63]Why?
[31:29.08]What the fuck is my car doing?
[31:32.50]God, I have to beat him.
[31:33.42]It's a race.
[31:39.22]It's an actual race where I can't see five feet in front of my face.
[31:52.23]Come on.
[31:53.05]Just stay in front of him.
[31:56.09]Why can he go that much faster than me?
[32:01.25]Just like NASCAR.
[32:06.63]I don't know what the goal here... What is this?
[32:09.58]I think I did it.
[32:11.80]Yay, I beat it!
[32:19.78]I think I broke it, and then I was able to pass him.
[32:25.20]Two lives left.
[32:26.30]New zone.
[32:27.20]This time we're in a taxi.
[32:31.79]Straight ahead.
[32:35.75]Points?
[32:37.12]Yep.
[32:38.24]We're just destroying bomb cars again.
[32:42.76]As we all know, this is really fun for me.
[32:49.57]I am having a fun time right now, though.
[32:51.77]Is that weird?
[32:52.23]It's strange that I'm having fun and playing this game.
[32:57.12]This one in particular.
[33:00.58]Not the other ones I was playing.
[33:02.10]Just this one.
[33:05.08]Take a detour, I think.
[33:10.51]Get that extra computer time.
[33:14.57]Launch.
[33:15.47]What did I just do?
[33:24.68]Okay, so the water is quicksand.
[33:28.46]Don't drive in the water.
[33:31.10]How am I supposed to get over there?
[33:34.72]How do I get across the zone?
[33:42.30]What is this?
[33:45.05]Do I have to destroy the ambulance?
[33:48.95]Why?
[33:51.51]This sounds...
[33:54.36]Oh, I just had to run somebody over.
[33:55.70]Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
[34:02.86]No!
[34:03.56]I'm fine.
[34:05.08]We're good.
[34:06.86]We'll get that extra computer time!
[34:09.10]Come on!
[34:14.46]God damn it.
[34:24.45]Alright, I'm done.
[34:38.85]One tire and you're done.
[34:51.37]My eyes hurt from this game, so do mine.
[34:53.89]Where's Jim?
[34:54.95]Alright, I think that's gonna be it for tonight.
[35:07.34]Ugh.
[35:17.01]R.I.P.
[35:17.77]everybody's messages.
[35:21.59]Yeah, that's going to be it.
[35:23.51]And that's going to be it for PlayStation 1 for a little while.
[35:26.85]We still have, um... We have, like, seven or eight PlayStation 1 games to play.
[35:33.72]But I want to take a break from PS1.
[35:35.22]Because we've had three streams in a row now with PlayStation 1.
[35:38.42]And I would like to move to the current day.
[35:46.88]And I think on Thursday we're going to start Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[35:52.16]That's the plan.
[35:54.86]I'm gonna try to do that.
[36:00.03]And then after we do Kingdom Come Deliverance, there's, uh, Vermintide 2 comes out, by the way, in a few days.
[36:08.27]So I think me and Etalyx wanted to play Vermintide.
[36:11.29]That should be a lot of fun.
[36:12.47]The original game was so much, SO much fun.
[36:15.41]I enjoyed it a lot, so.
[36:18.59]Let's move this out of the way.
[36:20.91]Let's read some bits.
[36:26.32]Turn that off.
[36:27.42]Let me go.
[36:29.76]Move this out of the way.
[36:33.38]The beta was awesome.
[36:34.06]I didn't even get a chance to play it, so I'm really excited for it.
[36:39.85]I saw it at a convention and said, wow, this looks really, really cool.
[36:46.90]So we will hopefully get to play that a lot.
[36:52.97]March 8th ain't a few days.
[36:54.53]I think it's playable in like less than a week.
[37:00.42]I think maybe you can play the beta.
[37:04.94]At least that's what Etalyx was telling me, I think.
[37:07.96]But let's do some bits.
[37:09.72]Let's go back here, back in time to a few hours ago.
[37:13.75]Thank you to SoupOrSeal for $1.
[37:16.03]SwiftRage, ModBanjo.
[37:19.55]I don't have that kind of powerful
[37:22.63]I don't have the power to mod anybody.
[37:24.57]I took it away from myself.
[37:26.59]Couldn't be trusted.
[37:28.57]Thank you Comcast Customer Care for the three dollars.
[37:31.13]So I had an awkward situation with my drill instructor today.
[37:34.59]He asked me to show him my war face, but I ended up showing him my owl face.
[37:43.10]Thanks, dude.
[37:44.17]Mostly lost.
[37:44.71]Thanks for the $1.
[37:45.45]Why not just get a second webcam?
[37:48.53]That's what we did last time.
[37:50.45]I have two webcams.
[37:52.96]That camcorder really did look a lot better.
[37:57.87]It really did.
[37:59.51]I'm not sure how much of the first stream you watched, but I did two webcams last time, and it just looks like shit.
[38:07.08]That camcorder, I wish the battery lasted more than 45 to an hour, but it did look a lot better.
[38:16.68]I can't ban us all.
[38:18.36]But thanks, dude.
[38:23.26]Thank you also to
[38:26.05]Mostly lost again.
[38:27.03]10,000 bits says you ripped the shirt.
[38:31.24]Nope.
[38:32.54]Shirt stays on.
[38:33.28]I'm not ripping this shirt.
[38:34.58]We've talked about this like a... I thought a year has gone by.
[38:37.14]We've gone... A year has passed.
[38:39.18]And I still haven't ripped this shirt.
[38:40.16]I'm not going to.
[38:42.08]Thanks, though.
[38:42.44]Appreciate it, man.
[38:44.90]Thank you to TheLazyGuy for $9 here, 900 bits.
[38:48.14]Been watching you for years, Jerma.
[38:49.50]It's nice to have managed to catch streams recently.
[38:52.63]Also, don't listen to them.
[38:53.57]The shirt is sexy.
[38:55.46]Hey, thanks.
[38:56.70]Thank you, Lazy Guy.
[38:59.12]Welcome to the streams.
[39:02.00]Glad to have you.
[39:03.32]And we are seeing a full-on chat destruction right now.
[39:11.21]Should have killed that me when I had the chance.
[39:14.33]But thanks a lot, Lazy Guy.
[39:16.15]Thanks for sticking around.
[39:16.73]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[39:18.65]Much appreciated.
[39:20.47]Hope you enjoy the streams.
[39:24.40]Got way more where that came from.
[39:27.39]Not dead mod, Kyle.
[39:28.31]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[39:29.19]Here's another bit of random trivia for you, Jeremy.
[39:31.83]In 1999, Furbies were banned from the National Security Agency's Maryland headquarters because it was feared the toys might repeat national security secrets.
[39:42.78]Didn't people think that Furbies had cameras in them and they were being spied on by like the Russians or something?
[39:49.04]There was that rumor floating around where it's like, no, no, don't have a Furby in your house.
[39:52.30]You know the thing that's on their forehead?
[39:54.08]That's a Russian spy camera.
[39:57.07]It's like, fucking Wi-Fi didn't even exist back then.
[40:03.33]That thing was a light sensor to tell your kids goodnight when you turned off the fucking light.
[40:11.40]But thanks a lot, dude.
[40:12.58]Good trivia.
[40:14.28]DragonBreath75, thanks for the $1, please open an arcade where you have all the high scores and Burgah Boy sits there with a beer and laughs at me failing to beat them.
[40:24.67]You know, like, weird, distant pipe dream of something that would be interesting to do?
[40:31.08]I think I would like to run one of those barcades.
[40:35.58]I think it'll be fun.
[40:36.68]We're talking like 75-year-old me.
[40:38.48]No, that's way too long from now.
[40:39.96]You know what?
[40:40.52]Fuck this dream.
[40:41.06]It's never gonna happen.
[40:43.54]There's too much other shit I need to do and I want to do.
[40:46.20]So let's just like somebody else do that.
[40:47.96]Just make like a cool arcade where not Dave & Buster's because Dave & Buster's sucks.
[40:53.38]Dave & Buster's is like extraordinarily overpriced.
[40:55.85]It's like $4 to play a light gun game at Dave & Buster's.
[40:59.25]They do a half-price Wednesdays.
[41:02.15]And it comes down to like $2 to play that game for one life.
[41:06.18]No, you mean regular priced Wednesdays, Dave.
[41:17.21]But thanks a lot, man.
[41:18.19]Appreciate it.
[41:20.65]Thank you to Dome.
[41:24.93]Thank you, Domeishi.
[41:27.33]Thank you, Domeishi, for your $1 here.
[41:32.95]Pasta is health food.
[41:36.96]Yeah, but... I really did eat, like, too much bullshit today.
[41:41.16]That was just an excuse.
[41:42.22]I was just making excuses.
[41:44.72]But thanks, man.
[41:45.32]Thank you to Fred Flintstone for the $1.
[41:47.30]I've been watching since that asteroid struck Earth.
[41:51.17]Yabba dabba doo.
[41:52.95]Yabba dabba doo indeed.
[41:54.23]Thank you, Fred Flintstone, for the $1.
[41:57.55]Eleanor, thanks for the $5.
[41:58.47]They just say, nice.
[42:01.57]Thank you, Eleanor.
[42:02.21]Appreciate the $5.
[42:05.35]Meg, thank you, Megal Madraws.
[42:07.81]Thanks for the $10 here.
[42:09.77]$10 from Meg.
[42:11.69]Always tune in when I have to do commissions.
[42:13.93]You make work a lot more fun.
[42:16.25]Well, thank you, Meg.
[42:18.15]Hopefully you're drawing.
[42:20.43]Oh, it's Meg.
[42:21.53]It's Meg.
[42:23.11]It's Meg LM Draws.
[42:26.25]Like you're drawing.
[42:26.91]Okay, cool.
[42:28.41]Hopefully the commission goes well.
[42:31.03]Appreciate the $10.
[42:31.89]Thank you for sticking around and watching.
[42:35.93]We've lost control of chat.
[42:37.51]Let me do you a fucking quick little favor here, buddy.
[42:41.63]See you later.
[42:44.61]You know, put it in emote only mode.
[42:46.71]Put it in emote only.
[42:48.85]Only emotes are allowed.
[42:51.32]Hey, guess what?
[42:51.80]There ain't no Flintstones emotes.
[42:53.80]Sorry.
[42:56.64]Twitch has not done a sponsorship with the vitamins yet.
[42:59.14]You can't do, like, Fred Flintstone on a vitamin.
[43:05.76]Thanks a lot.
[43:06.26]Thank you so much to Topac, by the way.
[43:07.96]Topac earlier gave $50.
[43:08.92]And they said $50 joke.
[43:14.55]Topac, that's incredibly generous of you.
[43:15.97]I'm not sure what you're referring to.
[43:16.91]But thanks a lot, man.
[43:18.75]That's a lot of fucking money.
[43:22.81]Thank you, Topac.
[43:26.89]uh on top of that we have zangelic or x angelic or x angel x for the one dollar thanks a lot mostly lost thanks for the 30 30 30 one for each story PogChamp 30 bucks for one dollar for every story did I what did I tell 30 stories regardless thank you so much for the 30 dude

[43:58.22]Thank you.
[44:01.59]And I promise it's gonna be spent on old grandma TVs, PlayStations, and no vibes.
[44:06.59]Apparently.
[44:07.05]We're gonna yippee-ki-yay.
[44:09.47]We're not gonna play any fucking actual good games.
[44:12.53]That's not my point blank.
[44:13.59]Excuse me.
[44:14.88]The point blanks are fantastic games.
[44:17.20]Old school Light Gun.
[44:18.84]That's a treat.
[44:19.72]Alright?
[44:20.66]That's a treat.
[44:22.00]I wanted to do it.
[44:22.90]I wanted a little treat.
[44:23.77]I wanted to play Light Gun.
[44:26.05]Real Light Gun.
[44:26.97]Not emulated nonsense half Light Gun.
[44:30.83]I wanted a little treat.
[44:33.63]Why is everybody laughing at me about that?
[44:36.94]Thanks a lot, Lust.
[44:39.46]Thank you, Angel, for the $1.
[44:41.02]More outside jokes.
[44:43.60]There really was only one that was showing itself available.
[44:46.31]Thank you Dark Star for the $1.
[44:47.59]They also said that this problem did not affect any copies of Point Blank 2 or 3.
[45:16.88]I did pretty well in Point Blank 3.
[45:19.06]I love Point Blank 3.
[45:20.04]I was killing it in Point Blank 1.
[45:22.26]Point Blank Pluto, not that much.
[45:25.18]Point Blank 3, I did okay.
[45:28.49]Thanks a lot there, dude.
[45:29.81]Thank you MooMeansMoo for the $1.
[45:31.41]Paul Jex Rent-A-Cop.
[45:33.83]Also, I know your secret, Jerma.
[45:35.19]You can't fool me.
[45:37.87]I don't have any secrets.
[45:40.73]Hydra725, thanks for the $1.
[45:42.69]The window joke is worth some money.
[45:44.27]Here you go.
[45:44.77]Yabba Dabba Doo.
[45:45.83]Thanks, dude.
[45:48.22]Thank you, Topac, for the 10 bucks.
[45:53.21]$1,000 if you can rapid fire a real gun like that without blowing your head off by accident.
[46:02.09]What?
[46:04.35]What does that mean?
[46:04.91]I don't even know what that means.
[46:10.37]Like, leaning forward.
[46:13.14]Ay-yi-yi.
[46:14.72]Thank you, Topac, for the 10 bucks.
[46:16.24]Appreciate it, dude.
[46:18.16]SawDustPunnies.
[46:20.04]Thanks for the $1.
[46:20.80]I miss Jex.
[46:21.66]Me too.
[46:22.39]He was a much more high-quality streamer than me.
[46:26.13]Stix, thanks for the $1.
[46:26.89]What's up, Stix?
[46:28.99]Got any Karash Bandicoot games in that bundle of PlayStation 1?
[46:34.03]Uh, no, I try to stay away from games that are incredibly recognizable.
[46:40.92]Games that we all know, that we all played before.
[46:42.78]I mean, Dino Crisis is one of the games that we have to play, but... I mean, it's still kind of in the obscure realm.
[46:52.87]Because I could play Crash Bandicoot, but they remade them all.
[46:55.75]I don't even need to have a PlayStation 1 to play Crash Bandicoot now.
[47:02.71]And plus, like, all the Final Fantasy games.
[47:06.13]Like, oh, play Final Fantasy.
[47:07.04]They've been remade, like, four times.
[47:09.10]There's another one that's being remade.
[47:10.40]They remade it into a movie.
[47:12.58]Remember that?
[47:13.84]Remember when they remade Final Fantasy VII into a movie?
[47:19.39]I watched it.
[47:22.57]But thanks, man.
[47:24.01]No Crash Bandicoot is on the cards.
[47:26.95]Errorless, thanks for the $1.
[47:28.15]Excited for the Office of Jex movie coming out.
[47:30.99]For your information, this is a joke image, not a real movie.
[47:33.79]Please, please click it.
[47:35.59]Alright, I'm gonna please click this.
[47:43.84]You guys... Here.
[47:45.74]Here you go.
[47:49.40]There's your screenshot.
[47:52.06]There's Office of Jex.
[47:54.12]Coming soon.
[47:58.53]That's fucking funny.
[47:59.57]Thanks, man.
[48:02.57]Thank you to, uh... Thank you to MooMeansMoo for the $1.
[48:08.34]This game is just WarioWare with guns.
[48:10.36]Yeah, it's great.
[48:13.28]If you have a buddy to sit there with you and play, or you can do dual Berettas.
[48:17.81]It's very, very fun.
[48:19.55]Thanks a lot, man.
[48:20.05]Thanks for the $1, Moo.
[48:22.20]Danger Illustrated, thanks for the $5.
[48:24.06]Streamer doesn't know the bullet spread pattern is shaking my head.
[48:26.76]I do.
[48:27.72]I do.
[48:29.58]I do.
[48:33.37]Didn't have it today.
[48:34.01]Didn't have my medicine.
[48:37.73]You know what?
[48:38.67]I didn't drink tonight.
[48:41.59]Figured out the problem.
[48:43.97]Officer Jex has to drink on duty to be able to play that game correctly.
[48:49.02]I just needed two drinks and I would have been fine.
[48:53.54]I drank a bunch of coffee instead of having a couple of, like, beers.
[48:58.62]And it was too jittery, I was too fucked up with oil in my blood.
[49:04.19]Drinking makes me a better shot, it does.
[49:08.77]At least in point blank.
[49:09.81]Yeah, that was coffee versus booze.
[49:16.16]And you got to see how much better I was with booze.
[49:23.19]That's worrisome.
[49:33.62]Thank you, Danger Illustrated, again, for the $5.
[49:35.68]That stage and song will haunt my stress dreams.
[49:44.70]I'm so sorry.
[49:46.19]Thank you for the $5, though, Danger.
[49:47.53]Appreciate it, man.
[49:49.28]Seems like you gravitate towards those kind of games.
[49:50.60]Dude, my... I've wanted to make a video game for so long.
[50:11.12]But it's just the amount of time and money.
[50:15.36]Programmers are expensive.
[50:18.05]And it would take years and years and tons of money that I don't have.
[50:23.89]I would love to.
[50:24.49]If I had any knowledge of programming, maybe in my spare time I'd be able to do something like that.
[50:28.79]But I don't, and I never will.
[50:32.38]That would cost me probably hundreds of thousands of dollars to make a game the way that I would want to make it.
[50:38.46]And I know that's probably over-exaggerating by a shitload because people do Kickstarter games for like 30 grand.
[50:44.32]But that person also knows how to program.
[50:46.62]If you have to pay somebody to program versus you programming a game, it's a little different.
[50:54.55]You got like two guys that make a Kickstarter and they both know Python, that's alright, you know?
[51:01.10]You got a guy like me that doesn't know his ass from his eyeballs.
[51:05.57]I gotta pay somebody a ton of money to do that.
[51:11.39]What about Castle Griffinstein?
[51:12.63]Yeah, but, yeah, I guess that's true.
[51:14.60]I'm a fucking expert programmer.
[51:17.96]Uh, thank you to... Thanks, though, Darkstar.
[51:21.92]Appreciate it.
[51:23.28]Not dead mod, Kyle.
[51:24.20]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[51:25.02]Another bit of random fact to you, Jerma.
[51:26.49]Oscar the Grouch used to be orange.
[51:29.15]Jim Henson decided to make him green before the second season of Sesame Street.
[51:33.41]How did Oscar explain the color change?
[51:36.45]He said he went on vacation to the very damp swamp, mushy, muddy, and turned green overnight.
[51:45.29]Where did you get this information?
[51:48.09]What made you just be like, you know what, I gotta tell you about how Oscar the Grouch used to be orange.
[51:53.30]That was up there somewhere.
[51:55.02]You just pulled it up.
[52:00.49]Thank you, NotDeadModKyle, again, for the 25 cents.
[52:03.95]Jerma didn't feel like posting another random fact, so here's a joke instead.
[52:07.81]Here we go.
[52:08.33]Here you go.
[52:09.63]Judge.
[52:10.09]We're going to judge accordingly.
[52:11.83]Why are there fences around a graveyard?
[52:14.85]Because people are dying to get in.
[52:22.48]You've been found.
[52:23.92]Guilty.
[52:26.56]Guilty.
[52:29.09]Stix, thanks for the $1.
[52:30.07]Stix Renegade, again.
[52:30.95]Burnout Paradise is getting remastered.
[52:32.39]You gonna get it?
[52:33.17]Probably.
[52:35.01]Those games are a lot of fun.
[52:38.79]Didn't Burnout Paradise, didn't that come out not that long ago?
[52:43.45]That was like a PlayStation 3 game, right?
[52:48.32]That can't be more than 10 years old.
[52:51.52]I guess it is, I guess.
[52:54.69]PlayStation 2?
[52:55.79]What Burnout came out on, like, the last gen?
[52:59.45]Burnout was 2008.
[52:59.80]Yeah, it's still less than almost 10 years, yeah.
[53:05.84]That's cool.
[53:06.44]I'd probably play it, yeah.
[53:08.46]Doadward.
[53:09.28]Thank you, Doadward, for the $5.
[53:12.53]Sexy Jerm of full cam.
[53:14.23]Is that what they wanted?
[53:16.03]Is that what I bent over?
[53:18.39]Whoops.
[53:19.59]I was trying to plug it in a device.
[53:22.09]Uh, Uncle Frank, Uncle Frank's, uh, Uncle Frank's Magic Butter.
[53:27.45]That's not your name, but that's how I'm gonna say it.
[53:29.25]Thanks for the one dollar.
[53:30.94]Thanks for being a bueno amigo.
[53:34.62]Hey, thanks.
[53:36.16]Thank you, Uncle Frank.
[53:39.48]Uh, Demi Snake Gaming, thanks for the 25 cents.
[53:42.36]I believe in you.
[53:43.88]I'm glad that somebody does.
[53:45.68]Thanks a lot, man.
[53:47.80]Sticks, thanks again for the one dollar.
[53:49.24]Round one is a huge arcade with a bar.
[53:52.17]They also have bowling, billiards, and karaoke.
[53:55.45]It's at the Galleria Mall in Taunton.
[53:59.93]Hmm, that's cool.
[54:01.87]Where is... How far away is Taunton?
[54:06.84]Oh my god.
[54:09.86]Breaking shit.
[54:12.56]That's probably very far away from me, though.
[54:17.15]I'd have to check and see the exact mileage there, but I feel like Taunton is far away here.
[54:22.82]Maybe.
[54:25.58]But that's cool, though.
[54:26.82]I'll give it a look.
[54:29.94]Thank you to NotDeadModKyle again for the 25 cents.
[54:33.84]Feel like doing a final random fact tonight.
[54:37.64]Last random fact.
[54:39.59]The guillotine remained the official method of execution in France until the death penalty was abolished in 1981.
[54:44.31]The final execution performed by a guillotine was in 1977.
[54:48.10]Google it if you don't believe me.
[54:55.14]That's kind of fucked up.
[54:56.62]That's a good fact.
[54:57.32]I like it.
[55:01.66]SoundSplicer, thanks for the $15.
[55:04.48]Thanks for $15, dude.
[55:05.58]SoundSplicer.
[55:06.58]Hey, Jeremy, it's your mother.
[55:07.94]Don't forget to use your prescription deodorant.
[55:11.19]Love, Ma.
[55:11.73]I don't have a prescription deodorant.
[55:15.79]Although I did used to use the clinical strength.
[55:19.33]Don't do that.
[55:21.04]Here's what happens when you use the, quote, clinical strength deodorant that's at the pharmacy or at CVS or whatever.
[55:28.90]That shit stains your clothes.
[55:31.77]You will ruin every shirt you own.
[55:34.23]You'll put that on.
[55:35.19]Oh, wow, this is great.
[55:37.35]It helps a lot with sweat.
[55:39.55]And then three days later, you'll take a look at that shirt.
[55:41.61]You're going to put it in the laundry.
[55:42.97]And it's ruined.
[55:43.81]It'll have orange stains, like red stains under the armpits.
[55:48.00]Don't do it.
[55:51.34]All you need is just a little bit of powder.
[55:52.62]Just get some spray powder.
[55:54.30]Slap on some Oud.
[55:55.84]You'll be fine.
[56:00.66]Uh, Bob the Dog.
[56:01.82]Zero.
[56:02.24]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[56:03.38]Hate the game, not the player.
[56:06.51]Eh, you can hate me too.
[56:07.31]I was being a baby.
[56:09.31]Asterspace.
[56:09.87]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[56:11.89]Jeremy, I've been watching you for fucking years.
[56:14.37]And through thick and thin, you've always been keeping me sane.
[56:16.33]This is the least I can do.
[56:17.41]Thank you.
[56:19.29]Asterspace.
[56:22.84]You know, the least you can do is not give me money.
[56:27.36]You don't have to do that.
[56:30.15]Trust me.
[56:31.49]If you're just hanging out, you don't have to feel like you owe me money.
[56:37.85]But I do appreciate it nonetheless.
[56:39.27]Thank you, Astrospace.
[56:42.16]Hey, let's make it another few years.
[56:43.40]What do you say?
[56:45.16]That's right.
[56:46.00]I'm going to say it right now.
[56:46.98]I'm going to be streaming and making some video stuff for at least the next year.
[56:52.64]And then that's it!
[56:53.88]No, I'm kidding.
[56:54.36]That's a joke.
[56:57.94]I'm giving myself like... Alright, how about this?
[57:00.28]On like, June 26th of 2025 is when we're gonna have like a Jerm of Retirement party.
[57:08.89]Okay?
[57:10.19]June 26th... When was my first... Yeah, June 26th of 2025 is when we'll do a... I will retire.
[57:25.06]That's like eight years from now.
[57:27.28]Like seven years from now.
[57:28.56]Don't worry.
[57:29.96]We got a long time.
[57:33.39]Everyone's crying.
[57:34.47]Stop crying.
[57:35.13]It's not gonna happen for like another eight years.
[57:41.11]Fuck, I'll still make some fart noises when I'm 45.
[57:43.63]I'll still make like funny fart noises with my mouth and you guys will think it's hilarious, right?
[57:50.84]Banned.
[57:51.78]Alright.
[57:52.38]Take them off emote only.
[57:53.52]I think they've been good.
[57:54.22]They say they're all crying.
[57:55.12]I feel bad now.
[57:57.60]But thank you so much, Asterspace.
[57:58.73]Appreciate it.
[57:59.41]Thank you for the $10, and thanks for sticking around and watching.
[58:03.19]Uncle Frank's Super Butter.
[58:04.43]Thanks for the two bucks.
[58:06.29]Thanks for being a cool amigo.
[58:08.17]I'd let you use my butter anytime.
[58:11.14]Thank you.
[58:11.92]Appreciate that, Uncle Frank.
[58:13.70]Appreciate you letting me use your butter whenever I feel like it.
[58:16.64]I appreciate that.
[58:19.40]Asterspace, again...
[58:23.35]Okay, 10 bucks, and now they have 15 here.
[58:27.23]It's five, so a total of 15.
[58:29.19]Thanks a lot for the $5 here.
[58:31.19]And this is the most... You're the only person I know that can make anything funny.
[58:35.30]Thank you.
[58:38.58]Thank you.
[58:39.20]Thanks, man.
[58:43.22]I think that we just all sit here and laugh at shit.
[58:51.23]I'm just happy that I can share it with you guys.
[58:54.07]I'm happy that we can sit here and just... This is the shit I used to do with my friends.
[58:57.64]I would sit around with four or five of my buddies and we would just talk shit about games and laugh at shit and make jokes.
[59:05.82]We would do dumb shit in the games.
[59:07.12]This is exactly... I love this.
[59:12.64]It's just transitioned to a bigger platform, I guess.
[59:17.73]So...
[59:20.89]glad to be glad to be sharing it with you guys for sure mods are playing cookie clicker uh thanks though dude thank you asterspace niall oreone thanks for the one dollar so this is so this whole stream was just to show off the fact that you made a cameo appearance in die hard worst joke ever oh I want to look at that I want to see that
[59:48.10]To answer your question, Mod Kyle is talking about this.
[59:50.29]I started doing it because I was bored and wanted to see how many... I wanted to see how people would react to me just randomly spouting facts.
[59:58.05]Good old facts.
[59:58.91]Well, you know, it's not like we don't like facts.
[60:03.86]I like facts.
[60:05.76]I'm all about facts.
[60:07.54]Actually, I'm more of an opinion guy than a fact guy.
[60:11.36]I feel like a lot of people will like that.
[60:12.42]You guys like that?
[60:13.84]People give me facts, and yeah, that's fine, but I give my opinions on facts.
[60:19.59]I don't like to tell, I don't like, I don't like facts.
[60:24.69]I like to just talk about how I feel.
[60:26.47]Alright, let me see, Jerma stars in Die Harder.
[60:31.30]Let's just, I want to zoom in on this.
[60:33.80]That was me, that's me right there.
[60:42.53]Yeah, that's like what my face would look like if I was crying.
[60:46.61]Damn, that is fucking pretty close, especially at, uh, three seconds.
[60:51.93]The bottom.
[60:53.07]Holy shit, that's fucking crazy.
[60:57.68]That is really, really weird.
[61:01.52]Um, but thank you.
[61:03.84]Thank you, Niall, for the $1.
[61:05.70]Thank you, Topac, for the $1,000.
[61:08.51]Thanks for the $10 here, Topac.
[61:10.65]More money from Topac.
[61:13.48]I'm not sure if you're immune to shit games or we just have weak eyes.
[61:18.89]Oh, no.
[61:20.01]That Die Hard was giving me a lot of trouble.
[61:24.23]That was not easy for me to do.
[61:27.39]It's crazy because I used to play these games so much when I was younger.
[61:31.59]No wonder everybody's eyes are so bad that are in their late 20s, early 30s.
[61:35.70]We were looking at that all day.
[61:38.26]I used to play that game all the time for hours every day.
[61:43.74]It's a miracle that I can still see colors.
[61:50.52]Thank you, uh... Thank you, Neck, for the $5.
[61:52.40]Thank you so much, dude.
[61:55.08]Hope you stick around for more.
[61:55.88]Because we've got plans.
[61:56.48]We've got plenty of plans.
[62:14.08]I'm a plan guy, you know?
[62:15.74]I'm an opinion planner.
[62:16.92]I plan out my opinions.
[62:19.96]Thank you, though, dude.
[62:21.94]Stick around.
[62:24.04]Moo means moo.
[62:24.60]Thanks for the $5.
[62:25.12]I wanted to share my grandmother's shepherd's pie recipe.
[62:28.20]Don't do that.
[62:29.04]She'll be very upset with you.
[62:32.47]You ever notice on, like, Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, when Guy Fieri is going over what's in the bowl?
[62:39.56]Oh, we got our paprika, and coriander, and hold on, and there's, like, a little thing, a little tube, and they have to cut the cameras.
[62:49.21]If you tell us what's in that tube, your grandmother is going to lose her fucking mind.
[62:54.51]Don't do it.
[62:58.92]Shepherd's pie is awesome.
[62:59.76]What are you talking about?
[63:04.66]Guy Spaghetti.
[63:05.82]It's Fieri.
[63:06.86]It's not.
[63:07.40]It's Guy Fieri.
[63:08.20]Oh, I'm going to puke.
[63:15.84]Ever considered Twisted Metal?
[63:16.78]I love Twisted Metal.
[63:17.48]I just don't think I'd want to stream it.
[63:18.66]A game like that, I feel like you need to play with other people.
[63:23.28]Otherwise, I'm going to be driving around shooting at bots.
[63:26.10]Which, meh.
[63:27.14]I'm not sure I'm into it.

[65:23.29]Because you need to be learning in school.
[65:25.41]And I can't teach you the necessary bits and pieces of American and European and whatever.
[65:32.01]I'm not sure what country you're from, but I can't teach you the history of these countries.
[65:35.51]I can't teach you math, obviously, because I couldn't count on my own stream.
[65:42.05]Your education is important.
[65:43.47]So make sure that's first.
[65:46.37]But thank you for the $10.
[65:47.86]Appreciate it.
[65:50.78]I'm...
[65:54.63]I'm glad you're having a good time here.
[65:57.29]Thanks a lot, dude.
[65:57.69]No, but we're talking about like PlayStation 1.
[66:14.77]PlayStation 1, everybody knows the classics.
[66:17.83]What am I going to play through?
[66:18.65]Resident Evil 1?
[66:19.44]No.
[66:19.56]Am I going to play Tomb Raider?
[66:24.34]No, not really.
[66:25.70]See, to me, the point blanks were really, really good.
[66:34.30]Oh, the camera fell off.
[66:38.54]The thing, I must have bumped it or something.
[66:42.10]Those games are classic.
[66:43.00]Those are classic good PlayStation 1 games.
[66:47.10]Those hold a candle still.
[66:48.08]They still hold up to this day, I would say.
[66:51.96]Those are very good games.
[66:56.01]But thanks, dude.
[66:56.51]Thank you to Samuel.
[66:58.47]Samuel Sish for the $1.
[67:00.45]I work in a secondhand game store.
[67:03.29]If I come across any weird shit games, is there a way to share them with you?
[67:10.43]Um... No, I don't really have, like, a PO box or anything.
[67:14.43]I don't really have a way, means for anyone to send me anything.
[67:18.19]I probably never will.
[67:19.09]I just don't... I don't want anyone to, like, send me stuff.
[67:26.48]I do appreciate the thought that anyone would want to do something like that.
[67:30.94]But... No, I just... That kind of opens up a can of worms for me.
[67:38.50]Because I know, I know, I know you guys are going to tell me it's not possible.
[67:42.94]I know you are.
[67:44.80]But I just foresee an event where I reach into that PO box and I pull out a Mason jar that's been wrapped up a thousand times and somebody shit in a jar and sent it to me.
[67:56.55]And I know that it's not possible, but it probably, somebody will find a way.
[68:00.83]Somebody will find a way to shit in a jar and seal it up and then make it so it can go through scanners and stuff and it'll end up at my front door.
[68:15.87]So no, I don't buy, I don't plan on it.
[68:22.48]This is just a chat full of deleted messages.
[68:29.06]Now it is, yeah, because people are misbehaving.
[68:37.10]But thanks, dude.
[68:37.97]Thank you Molotov Bartender for the 25 cents.
[68:40.07]Just tuned in, did I miss the gun cam meme?
[68:43.55]Yes, you did.
[68:44.89]You did miss the GoPro on the gun, unfortunately.
[68:52.33]Thank you to Nir for the 10 bucks.
[68:57.38]Thanks a lot for the 10 bucks, Nir.
[68:58.28]Good luck.
[68:58.50]Good luck.
[68:58.76]It is an incredibly fun
[69:11.99]but very, very challenging process.
[69:14.32]And you have to go into it with a very particular mindset.
[69:21.14]Never do it for money.
[69:22.94]Never do it for fame.
[69:24.70]Do it because you want to.
[69:26.64]I wish you the best of luck, I really do.
[69:32.44]Mostly lost, thanks for the one dollar.
[69:33.86]Mostly lost!
[69:34.62]Why did I say it like that?
[69:35.62]Hey, mostly lost!
[69:36.54]Thanks for the one dollar, man.
[69:39.34]They say, hey, and then he masters keyboard.
[69:44.28]Yeah, and that's also a very important skill just put in the chat here.
[69:47.10]And remember, if you're good at something, never do it for free.
[69:52.99]Words to live by.
[69:55.65]Topac, thanks for the $1.
[69:56.77]Can you ban bits, OWO?
[69:59.01]No, I can't.
[69:59.61]I don't know how I would even attempt to do that.
[70:07.57]Hey, thanks Fred Flintstone again for the $1.
[70:09.52]You should play Flintstone's Bedrock Bowling for PlayStation 1, lizard man.
[70:18.12]I'm... How... Why is that name available?
[70:21.82]Honest to God.
[70:23.70]Why is Fred Flintstone an available name on Twitch?
[70:28.02]Nobody did that yet?
[70:29.52]Over seven years of this website?
[70:31.96]How?
[70:32.65]How are you the first person to do this?
[70:34.89]How long have you had this username?
[70:37.90]You must have just signed up for this username.
[70:46.52]Did you pay somebody for this?
[70:48.72]That's a perfect Fred Flintstone.
[70:51.23]That's the Fred Flintstone.
[70:58.69]December 20th, 2016.
[71:01.73]No way, I don't believe it.
[71:05.09]Is there a way to see how old the username is?
[71:11.38]I don't fucking believe it for a second.
[71:12.70]There's nobody that was watching my stream named Fred Flintstone for the last couple of years that just happened to be Fred Flintstone.
[71:23.05]Congratulations on getting the official Fred Flintstone username.
[71:26.37]Thanks, man.
[71:26.99]Thank you, Crimbalt, for the $1.
[71:28.35]Have you heard of Ratchet & Clank?
[71:30.43]And if so, does it look like something you'd play?
[71:33.09]I have.
[71:35.21]I have never really played Ratchet & Clank.
[71:40.62]I've watched a lot of people play it.
[71:44.60]But I've never myself spent much time in it.
[71:48.98]Ratchet and Clank to me, and hopefully nobody gets offended by this, but I feel like Ratchet and Clank is the Super Mario 64 type game.
[71:59.16]It's like if Mario had a couple of funny guns.
[72:03.14]Right?
[72:03.84]Am I wrong here?
[72:09.16]Like, you gave Super Mario 64 a chicken gun.
[72:17.66]Is that, am I correct?
[72:20.59]Like, take Super Mario Odyssey, and give him a few rocket launchers and assault rifles and stuff.
[72:30.31]I guess.
[72:30.65]Not even close.
[72:35.27]And, oh, and a main character that talks way too much.
[72:44.22]I said it like it's a bad thing?
[72:45.24]Oh no, I'm not saying it like it's a bad thing.
[72:49.72]I'm not saying that that's a bad thing, I'm just, I'm just, is that an ob- is that observation correct?
[72:55.06]If it's not, I will retract that statement and I will fucking say I'm sorry.
[72:59.66]And I am incredibly sorry for that.
[73:06.54]You just pissed off a lot of people.
[73:09.96]Streamer actually sucks this time.
[73:11.84]No, I'm just kidding, it's a joke.
[73:14.27]There he goes, backtracking again, backtracking.
[73:19.51]I've said like every game sucks.
[73:22.59]Is there any video game that I like?
[73:24.64]Yes, there is.
[73:31.94]Streamer calls beloved PlayStation character shitty Mario.
[73:38.23]No controversy, no controversy.
[73:43.02]Yeah, alright, so... Alright, that's the problem.
[73:45.27]I understand now.
[73:46.35]I thought Jack and Dexter was Ratchet and Clank.
[73:52.63]Holy shit, those are like the same exact game, aren't they?
[73:57.33]Jack and... Like, Ratchet and Dexter.
[74:01.06]Jack and Clank.
[74:01.66]What do you mean they're not?
[74:14.07]Yeah, Dexter's fucking ratchet laboratory.
[74:22.25]The place is like falling apart.
[74:24.89]The shingles are coming off the roof.
[74:30.65]Dexter's... One's edgier.
[74:40.54]Racket and Clankster.
[74:46.89]Have you even... Alright, this is... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[74:50.83]Wait.
[74:51.93]This is a very valid point, and I'm going to be very clear with this.
[74:56.67]Somebody just said, Skill just said, have you even played these games to hold an opinion?
[75:04.11]No.
[75:05.91]So what I'm saying is totally baseless.
[75:10.18]Completely baseless.
[75:11.10]And I am totally admitting this.
[75:20.16]Yes, I am speaking from a incorrect, wrong position, and I apologize.
[75:27.64]I apologize to fucking Daxter and Clanker.
[75:35.90]I haven't played any of the games I criticized.
[75:40.32]That's not true, Darkstar.
[75:41.52]That's not true.
[75:42.80]I've played Twilight Princess, and I criticized that.
[75:52.37]Jax, Jax and Clank.
[75:55.55]Yeah, Jax and Jerma.
[76:05.92]For one minute, that's not true.
[76:07.00]I played it for like at least 40 minutes.
[76:08.98]I got to the part where you turn into the dog.
[76:10.32]That doesn't have to like 30 minutes into the game.
[76:12.00]Alright, let's go.
[76:13.56]Let's move on.
[76:14.04]We're almost done here.
[76:16.83]Uh... Thank you, Topac, for the $1.
[76:18.73]Why burn out when flat out is already available on Steam?
[76:23.33]Well, because... This hasn't been a new flat out in years.
[76:27.45]This is a new burnout.
[76:30.01]KingBot, thanks for the $0.50.
[76:31.23]People in... Um... People in Dubai don't like the Flintstones, but people in... Abu Dab... Oh, it's a Joe.
[76:38.84]He's saying Abu Dab-a-do.
[76:42.56]Thank you.
[76:42.88]Move means move for the $1.
[76:44.06]Nice quote of the stream.
[76:45.97]Quote, If ever there is tomorrow when we're not together, there is something you must always remember.
[76:52.98]You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.
[76:57.36]But the most important thing is, even if we're apart, I'll always be with you.
[77:02.05]When did I say this?
[77:05.35]I said that tonight?
[77:07.07]That's pretty good.
[77:08.61]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[77:09.33]It's AA Mini.
[77:12.07]Have a great night, everybody.
[77:13.19]I thought, oh, well, fuck, I thought I said that.
[77:19.11]It's a nice quote of the stream.
[77:23.83]You said like as if I said that.
[77:28.62]Thank you Lithy for the $1.
[77:30.04]Check out my acapella group.
[77:34.78]I will after the stream.
[77:37.98]Mostly lost thanks for the $1.
[77:39.68]The offer for a 10,000 bits for one ripped Mexico shirt still stands.
[77:43.18]I'm not ripping my shirt for a hundred bucks.
[77:48.47]And yes, I am aware that if you paid me $100 to rip this shirt in half, I could just find where this was and buy another one for like $12.
[77:55.63]Nope.
[77:56.15]Principle.
[77:58.06]In principle.
[77:58.62]Not gonna do it.
[78:00.44]I'm just trying to say a nice quote, man.
[78:06.20]A.A.
[78:06.70]Minnie wrote Winnie the Pooh.
[78:12.10]Um... You mean the worst Disney property?
[78:18.88]Okay.
[78:21.98]It's about a bear that sticks his head in honey and gets stung by bees and shit.
[78:26.55]And there's a little fucked up pig.
[78:27.97]That is just the rabbit from Alice in Wonderland, but a different character.
[78:46.77]Oh, you're gonna wear a shirt, Winnie?
[78:48.51]Where you're not gonna wear any pants and his dick is hanging out?
[78:52.25]That's the most fucked up part for me.
[78:54.23]When I first saw that first episode of Winnie the Pooh and his schlong is just all over the place.
[78:59.13]Put a pair of pants on.
[79:00.63]Even Mickey Mouse wears pants.
[79:02.15]Mickey Mouse wears pants and no shirt.
[79:03.79]Don't you know how to do that as a male?
[79:05.73]You don't walk around with no pants on and a shirt.
[79:07.77]You did it wrong.
[79:08.81]You did it backwards.
[79:10.39]Donald Duck.
[79:13.65]Does Donald Duck have pants on?
[79:15.92]Hold on, wait a minute.
[79:16.74]This is important.
[79:21.14]Does Donald Duck wear pants?
[79:28.99]Oh shit, he doesn't.
[79:33.33]He's doing it wrong!
[79:35.20]Donald Duck doesn't wear any pants.
[79:38.16]Squidward doesn't wear any pants.
[79:41.10]But at least we have... Look, there are some characters that get it right.
[79:45.22]SpongeBob doesn't wear a shirt, but he wears those square pants.
[79:50.32]Wait, does SpongeBob... SpongeBob wears... Hold on.
[79:54.85]Is SpongeBob shirtless?
[79:56.75]He's just like a yellow sponge with brown pants on, right?
[79:59.03]No, he has like a fucking goofy... He has like a red Donald Trump tie.
[80:02.03]Hold on.
[80:03.01]I need to look at this.
[80:06.75]SpongeBob.
[80:11.33]No, I'm sorry.
[80:12.39]Excuse me.
[80:13.47]Excuse me.
[80:14.49]SpongeBob does not have a shirt on.
[80:17.07]That is a pant shirt.
[80:19.09]That shirt is a box that he sticks his legs into.
[80:25.16]That is novelty underwear that he is wearing, okay?
[80:37.06]Yes!
[80:37.72]Look, that's like a jokey novelty pair of boxers.
[80:41.11]Oh, it's like a tie?
[80:42.45]It's a shirt?
[80:42.99]Look at that.
[80:43.53]Look at... He stuffs his legs into his pants, and the shirt is not even a quarter of an inch.
[80:56.88]Do you wear... Of course I wear novelty underwear.
[80:59.62]I have this funny casino one, I have Captain America, I have Aquaman underwear.
[81:05.79]I have underwear with dinosaurs and shit on it.
[81:07.83]Who doesn't wear novelty underwear?
[81:11.49]How do you explain the sleeves?
[81:16.57]But those are just like two... Those aren't sleeves.
[81:24.40]If they were sleeves, they would be connected to the shirt.
[81:28.30]What do you mean I don't?
[81:29.02]I'm wearing novelty underwear right now.
[81:35.70]Yep.
[81:36.58]What is it?
[81:41.02]Yeah.
[81:42.10]It's... I'm wearing... It's Richard Nixon's face.
[81:44.94]On my, like, entire area here.
[81:46.30]Uh, anyways.
[81:55.56]Jeremy, you're trying so hard.
[81:59.90]No, trying hard for what?
[82:07.68]I'm like, I'm reaching here.
[82:09.36]I'm reaching with the SpongeBob shit.
[82:14.51]We need to have more cartoon characters that put pants on.
[82:19.55]We need some other characters that don't wear fucking pants and wear a shirt.
[82:22.14]And we're supposed to be okay with this.
[82:24.44]I need to write a letter.
[82:28.62]I'm just, I'm supposed to be okay with this.
[82:35.58]the... Alvin and the Chipmunks?
[82:39.93]Alvin and the Chipmunks, right?
[82:42.27]No, wait.
[82:42.75]No, they do.
[82:43.57]They wear, like, full clothes.
[82:47.65]Hey, the Flintstones do.
[82:49.23]They have full clothes on them.
[82:50.47]The fully clothed Flintstones.
[82:53.97]Sonic has shoes, but no pants.
[82:55.57]Or a shirt.
[82:56.23]Yeah.
[82:56.67]Fucking weirdos.
[83:03.20]Burgah Boy in the first Rumble wasn't wearing pants.
[83:07.46]Now, Winnie the Pooh is one of my favorite childhood stories.
[83:11.30]You know?
[83:12.46]Winnie the Pooh.
[83:13.94]A.K.A.
[83:15.18]Terrible Calvin and Hobbes.
[83:20.70]Okay, alright.
[83:21.74]I'm just kidding.
[83:22.48]It's a joke.
[83:23.76]It's a joke.
[83:24.24]Let's move on.
[83:26.58]Um... Monty the Moose, thank you for your $1.
[83:31.90]Don't rip your shirt.
[83:34.44]I'm not gonna.
[83:37.26]That's over the line.
[83:39.22]I'm kidding.
[83:40.32]I'm kidding.
[83:40.66]I love Winnie the Pooh.
[83:42.52]When Pooh gets like stuck in the hole and they draw a face on his ass.
[83:46.90]You know, like the rabbit shoves the marker up his ass and like does a funny face.
[83:50.38]And they're like, oh, it's Winnie the Pooh, remember?
[83:53.39]That's funny.
[83:54.93]That's true, true comedy.
[83:59.99]Coconut Lips, thank you for your $1.
[84:02.41]I got all these bits by watching ads.
[84:04.05]Adding this to the Rip the Shirt Fund.
[84:12.65]Wait, you're almost as bad as streamers who purposely do bad at games to get donations.
[84:17.71]What are you talking about?
[84:19.29]You think I'm baiting donations right now?
[84:20.97]I'm not baiting donations, but if you have something to say, you know, go ahead and add it to the conversation.
[84:32.06]Thank you, Coconut.
[84:33.96]Appreciate it.
[84:34.50]Thank you, Lithy, for the $1.
[84:35.64]Jeremiah, how do I get you to listen to my acapella groups?
[84:37.54]I can't post a link.
[84:39.36]I will.
[84:39.60]I'm going to listen to it.
[84:44.61]I will, don't worry.
[84:45.85]Thank you, though, for the $1.
[84:47.13]I, Jerome, or I, Deron, me, thanks for the $5.
[84:50.03]Hey, Jerome, I've been watching your stuff for years.
[84:53.13]Just wanted to give back to you for all the times me and my friends have busted our guts laughing at your stuff.
[84:57.28]Keep it up.
[84:59.02]Thank you, I, Deron.
[85:00.76]Appreciate it.
[85:01.62]Thank you so much.
[85:02.16]Moo means Moo literally just gave you money to tell you he's mad you insulted Winnie the Pooh.
[85:08.65]Baiting donations for, oh my god.
[85:12.24]What the fuck?
[85:14.10]Shut up!
[85:14.82]Don't say that!
[85:16.97]Moo means moo.
[85:17.65]Hold on.
[85:18.17]What?
[85:18.91]One dollar!
[85:20.21]I'm now considering unsubbing.
[85:21.61]I watched the many adventures of Winnie the Pooh on VHS religiously as a child, and you just essentially committed blasphemy.
[85:28.27]I love you, but you hurt me.
[85:29.25]I think we need to- What?
[85:31.14]Whoa, no, dude.
[85:32.26]What the fuck?
[85:35.54]Don't fucking- Oh, wait.
[85:36.76]Baiting donations at ten bucks?
[85:38.68]What did he say?! !
[85:41.48]Oh my god!
[85:42.64]Winnie the Pooh vs. Jerma 2.
[85:54.53]What?
[85:57.69]Dude, did you hear what this guy said about Winnie the Pooh?
[85:59.67]Fucking he said like, yo, don't I dare you.
[86:02.15]What the fuck?
[86:03.95]What am I doing?
[86:04.33]I'm like tapping.
[86:04.87]It's looking on the keyboard.
[86:07.93]Uh, thank you to...
[86:11.26]We're just fucking around.
[86:11.96]We're just having a good time.
[86:12.76]That's all it is.
[86:16.20]Uh, Ian Animator, thanks for the one dollar.
[86:17.85]Hey, I'm working on a video game made using stop motion.
[86:21.25]I'd love to work on something Jerma related, maybe get in touch.
[86:24.17]Game is called Flugen.
[86:25.87]You can see a trailer on Steam.
[86:27.35]You don't need to mention this out loud.
[86:29.63]Oh, well, I just did.
[86:32.20]Flugen.
[86:33.72]F-L-O-O-G-E-N.
[86:38.30]You can tell this guy's a YouTuber.
[86:41.24]Former YouTuber.
[86:44.12]The artist formerly known as YouTuberJerma985.
[86:46.30]No, we'll be back to YouTube.
[86:50.08]Don't worry.
[86:51.54]Maybe someday.
[86:56.30]But stop motion stuff, Ian Animator.
[87:02.32]That's very hard to do.
[87:09.08]Fucking donate, I dare you.
[87:12.29]Does Jerma Rumble then sells out?
[87:14.93]No, never.
[87:17.97]I mean, I don't know what I would want to do if I want to do something.
[87:24.84]The idea is interesting, though.
[87:27.94]I'd have to take a look at some of the stuff you've done.
[87:30.46]I'm going to take a look at Flugen when I turn the stream off.
[87:32.56]We'll see how you're doing.
[87:34.66]Good luck, though.
[87:36.00]Hope it's good.
[87:37.26]Wish you the best.
[87:39.43]O-W-O-342, uh, can the mods ban usernames?
[87:42.99]Thanks for the $1.
[87:43.45]No, they can't.
[87:45.55]So, uh, scoop them up.
[87:48.80]Fred Flintstone with $1, go until you die.
[87:50.82]That's what I said, yep.
[87:51.78]That's a quote from me.
[87:52.58]Thanks a lot, Fred.
[87:54.04]Just gonna call you Fred from now on.
[87:56.96]Uh, we're almost done here at the end.
[87:59.28]Unconquerable, or Unconqueraby, thanks for the $1.
[88:02.14]How do you think the kid felt?
[88:06.01]What kid?
[88:06.31]The kid?
[88:07.49]The kid?
[88:13.91]The kid.
[88:14.45]I don't know what you mean by that, but thank you for the $1.
[88:16.68]Unconquerable.
[88:18.08]Ratuna, thanks for the $1.
[88:19.10]Speaking of FlatOut, a new company made FlatOut 4 last year, but while it was much better than FlatOut 3, it wasn't nearly as good as FlatOut Ultimate Carnage or FlatOut 2.
[88:27.84]I think I played FlatOut 4.
[88:31.48]I'm pretty sure.
[88:37.20]Didn't I make a video on FlatOut 4?
[88:38.80]Or was that FlatOut 3?
[88:41.55]I really just don't remember.
[88:42.55]I think I streamed it
[88:45.58]I don't remember.
[88:47.42]But, yeah.
[88:48.62]I probably agree with you.
[88:51.04]MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $1.
[88:52.60]I'm now considering on Subway.
[88:53.94]I've heard it already.
[88:56.84]MooMeansMoo again, thanks for the $1.
[88:58.40]Wacky Contrarian Uncle Streamer.
[89:02.80]Three was a video you streamed for.
[89:04.20]Yeah, I figured I played it.
[89:08.18]People are getting timed out for adding me.
[89:13.40]Nobody can send you like a personal message ever.
[89:17.28]That's what happens when you make your name an unspeakable chat name.
[89:22.96]Storm, thank you Storm Lorc for the 10 bucks.
[89:26.55]Baiting donations never.
[89:30.73]But that's, we're speaking in irony and ironically.
[89:35.75]I mean, you just ironically gave me 10 bucks.
[89:39.38]But you still gave me the $10.
[89:40.60]So did I bait... Did I ironically, unironically, accidentally, ironically make you just give me $10?
[89:47.45]I hope not.
[89:47.85]I hope that was on your own volition.
[89:49.01]I hope that was on your own free will.
[89:52.73]Thank you though, Storm.
[89:53.39]I appreciate the $10.
[89:56.47]Final two here.
[89:57.11]Moo means moo, thanks for the mandala.
[89:58.39]I'm still miffed, but thank you for the stream, even if you didn't stick the landing.
[90:01.29]Better luck next time, Jeremy.
[90:02.37]Love you.
[90:03.61]I was just kidding around.
[90:04.85]Let's just be clear.
[90:05.73]Winnie the Pooh is a classic tale.
[90:08.71]Christopher Robin, Winnie the Pooh, um, the, the, the pig?
[90:16.48]What's his name?
[90:17.18]Piglet?
[90:19.02]What's the rabbit's name?
[90:22.44]What is the rabbit's name?
[90:24.22]The guy that had the garden?
[90:30.25]What is the rabbit's name?
[90:37.17]Hopper?
[90:40.24]Rabbit.
[90:44.34]It's just rabbit.
[90:49.80]Piglet is a good name for me.
[90:51.30]No, it's... Please.
[90:54.10]Get out of here.
[90:56.93]Monty the Moose, thanks for the 25 cents.
[90:58.66]Hey, I'm Fred, and I'm looking for my dog.
[91:03.24]I don't know what that's a... That's the villain from A Bug's Life.
[91:09.24]Oh, you guys fucking slay me.
[91:11.79]You guys, seriously.
[91:14.85]The villain from A Bug's Life.
[91:20.07]Why would you even know that?
[91:21.91]That's so great.
[91:22.93]I love it.
[91:24.05]Why would you know that?
[91:25.71]What was the tiger's name?
[91:28.01]There was a tiger?
[91:28.83]Oh, you're talking about this guy.
[91:32.37]Oh, that I can... Hold on a minute.
[91:39.38]I need to get a point of reference.
[91:50.37]Alright, let's get it.
[91:52.99]I need to, I need, where's my headphones?
[91:57.57]Don't, don't, don't haha me, okay?
[92:00.39]That was a good impression of a character, a beloved Disney character.
[92:06.08]Don't tell me that was like a cringy, cringy.
[92:09.38]That was an exact replica of a classic Disney voice.
[92:14.94]Listen.
[92:16.32]Listen.
[92:21.58]See?
[92:24.54]I did that perfectly See?
[92:32.16]How about this one?
[92:39.60]No, this is the same video
[92:51.86]I can't tell the difference.
[92:53.19]Oh, yeah, right.
[92:55.57]Alright.
[92:56.03]Good night, everybody.
[92:56.83]I'll see you on Thursday.
