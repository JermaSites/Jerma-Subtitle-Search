[00:05.42]Welcome back.
[00:06.18]I have something for you.
[00:07.86]You do?
[00:08.34]Yeah.
[00:08.46]What do you got?
[00:09.00]Let me see.
[00:10.00]What is this?
[00:11.20]Do we have like a new friend?
[00:12.21]Yeah.
[00:13.77]Is this like our god dog?
[00:14.85]What is this guy doing?
[00:16.49]He's defending the fort, man.
[00:21.09]That's pretty cool.
[00:22.01]Hey.
[00:23.17]Hey, you.
[00:25.93]I'm talking to you.
[00:27.86]He's waiting patiently for Lepter to come out.
[00:32.37]You look at me when I'm talking to you.
[00:33.61]Alright.
[00:35.19]Well, I just hit him.
[00:36.81]He's dead.
[00:38.15]Nice.
[00:39.57]Alright, guys.
[00:40.13]Here you go.
[00:41.07]Armor up.
[00:42.25]He's got an iron sword.
[00:44.59]And I'm over here trying to pass out wooden swords.
[00:48.41]I'll take a wooden sword.
[00:51.56]I will absolutely take a wooden sword.
[00:52.64]It's starting to be daytime now.
[00:55.66]I'm just harvesting.
[00:59.08]Oh, don't use your sword, bro.
[01:04.39]I am a Minecraft pro.
[01:05.87]I know these things.
[01:07.59]I was just making sure you know so you could tell me that you know.
[01:10.47]It's just funny to hear the reactions.
[01:16.53]I'm just using my sword, like smashing stuff.
[01:20.79]It's because you're a true barbarian.
[01:22.39]It's okay.
[01:24.35]Okay, guys.
[01:25.77]So what's the plans?
[01:27.55]Alright, let's go to this one over here.
[01:29.63]I built a trail to it.
[01:34.53]Let me just go over here and drop the resources that I have.
[01:38.65]How did you guys get so much armor?
[01:40.57]I've got two pairs of leather boots.
[01:43.21]That's all I got.
[01:43.95]I dropped some leather in the... I got a hat.
[01:47.31]Here you go, Jerma.
[01:48.57]That's some boots for you.
[01:50.27]Oh, thanks.
[01:51.29]Yeah, now I just need to armor up a little bit.
[01:54.67]Follow moi.
[01:57.33]Shall we go raid one of these shelters first?
[02:00.51]Oh, I have leather pants.
[02:01.42]Where did that come from?
[02:04.36]Oh, it's raining.
[02:04.74]Oh, it started raining.
[02:06.74]Wonderful.
[02:08.10]Good thing I got my ducky boots on.
[02:10.91]Alright, there's a mob spawner in here.
[02:15.11]So, let's go destroy it.
[02:17.35]Alright, guys.
[02:18.31]I just stole the apple.
[02:19.39]Just wanted to let you know that.
[02:20.63]The apples.
[02:21.53]All of them.
[02:22.31]Oh.
[02:22.87]Sorry.
[02:23.13]I wanted that apple.
[02:26.09]Oh, this means the mobs are going to start spawning.
[02:29.67]Why?
[02:29.77]Because it's dark?
[02:31.01]So, are we just breaking in?
[02:32.67]Yeah.
[02:33.34]Are we doing a home invasion right now?
[02:35.34]Yep.
[02:36.01]How'd you get over there?
[02:38.29]There we go.
[02:38.73]Oh, there's a creeper down there, just so you know.
[02:42.11]Where?
[02:42.59]Inside?
[02:42.99]Yes, inside.
[02:46.09]Then wish me luck, good sir.
[02:48.29]Here, Jerma, it's fine.
[02:49.60]Oh, you got it open right here.
[02:50.72]Alright, let's do it.
[02:51.80]Wait, wait for it.
[02:53.68]Break this one below your feet.
[02:55.02]Just don't stand right above it.
[02:56.98]Watch out, move out of the way.
[02:58.20]There you go.
[02:58.84]I got it, I got it.
[03:00.45]I thought you were just- look at your pants!
[03:03.37]You look like Steve Urkel.
[03:05.97]You got your pants all the way up to your belly button.
[03:09.01]Shut the f- Why?
[03:13.42]Look at him!
[03:15.72]He's got a different texture pack on though.
[03:19.86]Oh, there he is!
[03:21.44]Get that- Oh no no no!
[03:23.22]Back up, back up.
[03:26.23]Good job, good job.
[03:27.53]Kite him around a little bit.
[03:29.47]Oh my god, there's a lot!
[03:31.85]Yeah, I think that this is like, uh... One of those areas where there's probably a spawner in there.
[03:39.53]There is a spawner in there.
[03:40.80]Yeah, another creep is coming up right now on the left side.
[03:45.92]Oh, there it goes.
[03:47.56]Did he blow up everybody or just himself?
[03:48.88]Nope, just... Looks like just himself.
[03:52.30]Alright, I'm gonna run in there.
[03:53.92]I'm gonna die.
[03:55.97]Here's my... Yeah, I'm gonna break another block.
[03:58.43]Don't fall in this hole.
[04:00.65]Here, take this.
[04:03.36]No, why'd you break this snow stuff here?
[04:06.12]What?
[04:06.44]I didn't, he exploded.
[04:07.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[04:09.90]The dude, like, exploded.
[04:12.76]Break this one.
[04:13.96]Right over here, the one I'm standing on right now.
[04:18.69]There you go.
[04:21.83]I can't reach it.
[04:22.33]Oop!
[04:23.27]Oop!
[04:24.94]We need a bow and arrow.
[04:26.59]That's what we need.
[04:27.03]Oh, they're going out.
[04:27.79]Alright, I'll just fall in and die.
[04:31.11]Here's my stuff.
[04:33.69]But what I'll do is... Take the iron sword and just like... Wait, wait, wait.
[04:38.43]No, I'm going to drop this on the spawner.
[04:40.86]Yeah.
[04:41.28]Just... Ready?
[04:42.08]Alright, back up, Jerma.
[04:43.52]Back up.
[04:44.70]A lot.
[04:45.00]They're all going to die.
[04:49.38]Yeah, they blew it up.
[04:50.66]Aha, yeah.
[04:52.10]There's a bunch... There's two or three in this.
[04:53.92]I'm going down.
[04:55.71]I'm gonna bring the bow.
[04:57.97]Oh, and then there was one.
[05:00.49]I thought he got him.
[05:01.65]I thought he got him.
[05:02.96]Let's go together.
[05:04.38]Hang on, hang on.
[05:04.88]There's something in here.
[05:06.04]Look, look, look.
[05:07.08]This is what I wanted to explore before.
[05:08.88]I think, was there only one more in there?
[05:11.21]Did you get him?
[05:12.50]Was there only one more creeper in there?
[05:14.00]Yeah.
[05:14.60]He blew up.
[05:15.48]Alright.
[05:16.38]There's nothing in here now.
[05:17.64]Oh god, there's one in here.
[05:20.64]Alright, here's the thing.
[05:21.48]We gotta get back to get our stuff before it disappears, but... Oh man.
[05:30.80]Man.
[05:36.02]Oh god.
[05:38.48]Yeah, that looks bad.
[05:39.78]That looks bad.
[05:40.38]Oh, I just fell again.
[05:41.58]You know, we can break blocks, so this is kind of silly.
[05:49.42]Jeremy, you running over to get our stuff?
[05:52.18]I'm running now, yeah.
[05:53.71]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[05:54.87]Hey, I found like a little... Oh, no!
[05:56.61]Oops.
[05:58.33]Oops.
[05:59.01]I am absolutely running back there.
[06:00.69]My bad.
[06:01.13]That's cool.
[06:04.85]It's like a lily pond.
[06:07.44]A tree?
[06:07.72]Yeah, like ten creepers right there.
[06:09.93]Oh!
[06:11.69]Crops!
[06:13.65]Ah, yes.
[06:14.55]We've got crops.
[06:16.43]Watch out, don't trample them!
[06:19.76]You have to jump to trample.
[06:22.10]No, you can just walk on it.
[06:24.02]No, they changed that.
[06:24.86]Oh, gotta get this stuff.
[06:30.88]Alright, I picked up all the stuff.
[06:31.98]There's a chest in here too.
[06:33.14]Plus we have wood and you can make a hoe.
[06:36.92]Alright, there was a bunch of sand, a stack of sand, a stack of gunpowder, and some Flint and steel.
[06:44.81]Where?
[06:46.03]The chest where we all died.
[06:50.87]And there's a sapling here in the corner.
[06:55.91]Ouch.
[06:56.33]What was that?
[06:58.29]Creeper.
[06:59.15]Oh, okay.
[07:00.56]So where are you guys?
[07:02.08]I'm trying to get back to you.
[07:04.83]Yeah, we were in like a secret area.
[07:09.61]Like in the beginning secret.
[07:11.45]You want to distract him?
[07:16.21]Run.
[07:17.89]Oh god, you made me take damage.
[07:19.99]I made you take damage.
[07:22.22]You made you take damage, sir.
[07:23.64]Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god.
[07:30.65]Watch out, there's another one coming up.
[07:32.87]You want to help me?
[07:34.77]Oh, you hit him?
[07:35.39]I was distracting him.
[07:36.43]It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
[07:37.79]I got him on me.
[07:39.33]I took the aggro, man.
[07:40.59]I took the aggro.
[07:42.57]Aggro.
[07:43.73]Alright, back out.
[07:48.60]Into the open.
[07:49.04]I'm stashing all the stuff that I just picked up.
[07:51.34]Into the rain.
[07:53.60]Across the thin snow bridge.
[07:58.30]I think Jerma has all of our stuff.
[08:01.37]I kinda do.
[08:01.87]You got any extra, any extra armor that I could have, maybe?
[08:06.77]Uh, the only, the only thing that, there was, the only thing that wasn't, what am I trying to say here?
[08:11.43]The only thing that was on the ground was leather boots and a leather cap.
[08:15.88]And a nether brick.
[08:17.62]I got nether brick, snow, glowstone, and then whatever's in, I picked up the sand.
[08:21.16]So we lost all of that awesome stuff.
[08:22.18]Is that what you're trying to say?
[08:23.52]Apparently.
[08:25.78]Here, let's try and, uh, attack this one.
[08:28.46]Wait for me.
[08:32.08]coming which way did you go okay I think I straight up I'd straight up straight up alright so this one has two records alright we did have some glowstone in the house though snowy plains
[08:54.04]Everyone sprint, because we have so much food.
[08:57.66]Yeah, I... Oh, look at all these spiders.
[09:00.58]Yeah, well, stalling planes looks fun.
[09:03.12]This is probably a lot more pleasant during the day.
[09:06.31]There's a crater over there.
[09:08.45]Here, shall we just come back to this during the day?
[09:11.79]Oh, look over there to the left.
[09:12.71]I see a melon farm.
[09:15.47]Melon farm.
[09:16.67]Yeah, look at you with your long view distance.
[09:19.41]It's not that far.
[09:21.26]What is shooting us?
[09:23.04]Oh, it's this guy.
[09:23.82]It's this guy right here.
[09:28.30]Wait, where is this dude?
[09:29.12]He's like behind you.
[09:30.74]To your left now.
[09:34.08]Oh, yeah, I see him.
[09:35.14]Get out of here.
[09:37.10]Why am I... There he goes.
[09:40.12]I don't know.
[09:40.48]I couldn't hit him either.
[09:45.59]We do need to kill some zombies, though, because I could use some zombie flesh.
[09:51.15]That would be awesome.
[09:52.69]Alright, I see a crater in the far right, and I presume there's something over there.
[09:57.69]Alright, I'm kind of out in the middle of nowhere, in no man's land out here.
[10:01.93]Oh, spider going towards you.
[10:03.99]That was not a good idea.
[10:05.39]Yeah, I know.
[10:09.59]I got a hit on the creeper.
[10:11.99]Sweet, I finished him off.
[10:13.67]Wait, why are these two fighting each other?
[10:16.93]Because one of them took damage from the other.
[10:21.55]Taking these guys down.
[10:22.57]I'm almost out of food, though, so... Kind of a problem.
[10:27.59]Get out of here, spider.
[10:30.52]Anybody got any food?
[10:32.02]I need arrows.
[10:32.70]Do you guys have arrows?
[10:34.06]Yeah, I do not.
[10:36.62]Alright, cool.
[10:38.06]Alright, zombies are the primary target here.
[10:41.39]No, there's a lecture.
[10:42.73]Let's just go to the melon farm You know that's then I'm sack the ocean of attack design today.
[10:51.54]Yeah, but where's the fun in that?
[10:55.34]You got a zombie on your left there It just bounced off of it.

[11:12.10]See that guy?
[11:13.63]On the left.
