[00:01.28]Hello.
[00:05.14]He's early.
[00:05.70]He's right on time.
[00:11.65]Welcome back, everybody.
[00:16.61]This community content catch-up stream.
[00:19.89]And I'm not talking about the red stuff.
[00:22.47]I still got it after like five days.
[00:28.42]We have a lot to talk about today.
[00:31.66]And a lot of it is going to be stuff that I don't want to say.
[00:35.26]And it's going to be also stuff that you don't want to hear.
[00:37.44]So it's going to be great for both of us.
[00:41.11]But both parties are going to be real happy about this.
[00:44.95]He's retiring.
[00:45.89]And I've decided that that is it.
[00:49.91]I broke dance too much and I'm done.
[00:51.71]No.
[00:58.23]uh over the last week uh well five days or four days but whatever you want to call it I've been having an internal conflict that was constant to decide what I was going to do I had an appointment with my doctor
[01:17.58]People are saying +2.
[01:19.22]This is not a joke.
[01:20.40]I'm about to really drop.
[01:21.68]I'm about to drop like a fucking... You guys are not going to be happy.
[01:25.12]This is not like, oh, here comes the fucking punchline.
[01:28.99]Okay, I got to relax.
[01:31.51]Here comes the punchline.
[01:36.03]No comedy.
[01:40.69]What you're about to hear is what I'm going to call a band-aid rip.
[01:48.63]This is going to get long-winded, so I hope you have time.
[01:51.27]For those of you that don't know, over the last couple of years, I've had mystery pain that runs down the middle of my chest, around to the side, and down the sides of my spine.
[02:13.00]I have been told...
[02:15.64]Oh, you probably have intercostal nerve damage.
[02:18.16]Oh, you probably have costochondritis.
[02:20.25]Well, you know, you might have rheumatoid arthritis.
[02:22.01]That test came back positive.
[02:25.74]And... I've had to kind of slowly, over the last...
[02:32.27]Two years.
[02:33.77]Try to figure the fuck... Figure this shit out.
[02:36.11]And find out what the fuck's going on.
[02:38.33]And kind of keep my regular life going too.
[02:40.89]But I have to be honest with you.
[02:42.67]Because I hope I am.
[02:44.59]You know, 95% of the things I say in this channel are lies.
[02:47.04]So I hope you know that I'm honest with you.
[02:50.34]All the time.
[02:52.12]I've been operating at probably like a 70 percentile.
[02:55.04]In two years.
[02:58.04]And it became abundantly fucking clear...
[03:02.80]over the last week or two that I have to figure this out and I have to focus on it and I have to make it an immediate concern because after the green screen stream and I talked to my doctor he's just sitting there he was like okay because I I was dead bad and we kind of came up with a treatment plan
[03:29.89]Or instead of, hey, maybe like once every two months you can come in and you'll go, hey, we have you scheduled for an MRI.
[03:36.53]Oh, I'll see you in like a month.
[03:38.99]I'm going to take the next like two or three weeks and 100% only focus on this with me and my doctor.
[03:46.70]That means procedures he might want to do, tests he might want to do, and get actually definitively, truly diagnosed for whatever the fuck is going on.
[04:00.06]Because you guys don't know.
[04:01.69]It's just been driving me crazy.
[04:05.91]I'm laying it all out in front of you.
[04:10.13]It's been driving me fucking crazy.
[04:15.57]And I don't want it to start negatively affecting the streams.
[04:26.61]This stream... Is seriously, like, such a positive outlet for me.
[04:33.23]And I'm not talking about, like, oh, positivity.
[04:34.78]No, no, I'm talking about, like, just... I get to come out here and we can fucking have a bunch of fun.
[04:39.24]I don't even have to think about this stupid shit.
[04:42.36]Now, yeah, sometimes it gets in the way because, I mean... When you have to start to wear a fucking back brace to sit down on a chair... I think it's probably time that you, like, go figure this shit out.
[04:52.37]Right?
[04:52.81]Right?
[04:56.80]And I've been, oh, maybe I'll stream three or four hours a day.
[05:01.03]No.
[05:02.39]I'm just going to take the fucking time.
[05:03.67]And I'm just going to... I'm going off the grid.
[05:06.79]For like two to three weeks.
[05:09.19]And we're just going to hammer this out and get treated.
[05:11.67]Because I haven't been treated for it.
[05:13.77]That's the worst thing.
[05:15.65]I went to physical therapy.
[05:17.77]And the physical therapist told me.
[05:20.45]He looked me right in the eyes.
[05:21.21]And he said, I don't think this is going to work for you.
[05:26.20]I'm just like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[05:28.34]He's like, well, if you have nerve damage or nerve pain, if you have like an intercostal nerve problem, I can't help you.
[05:34.46]And I'm just like, oh.
[05:38.00]Alright.
[05:41.80]Invest in a mecha spine.
[05:43.96]If I could, but it's not my spine.
[05:48.53]And that's the problem.
[05:49.27]It's like kind of going back and forth for like years.
[05:52.99]Where every couple months I do another test.
[05:55.95]It's like, well, no, you don't have any spinal disk problems.
[06:00.23]Okay, well, you're still fucking... Everything still hurts?
[06:03.72]Oh, I'll see you in two months.
[06:05.46]No.
[06:06.70]I'm not gonna... I'm just ripping the band-aid off.
[06:08.02]Because I want to just start to figure the fuck this shit out.
[06:12.92]It could be something so easy.
[06:14.72]Or it could be something that's very complicated.
[06:17.05]I just need to know, and I want to get it done.
[06:18.53]And so does my doctor.
[06:20.75]Now, here is... Here is the plan.
[06:26.90]I wanted to wait.
[06:29.04]By the way, we're streaming today.
[06:31.30]Like, I'm not going to turn... I didn't want to talk about... I didn't want to do like a... Hey, here, I'm going to make a tweet.
[06:36.47]Here's like 10 characters describing how I'm not going to be around.
[06:39.73]My back hurts.
[06:41.09]No, I wanted to stream today.
[06:42.61]Talk about it today.
[06:43.21]We're going to do community content today.
[06:44.37]There's a lot of stuff to catch up.
[06:47.82]I'm going to hang out.
[06:48.90]We're going to chill.
[06:51.20]But...
[06:53.51]Because of my absence, that is about to happen.
[06:57.34]This has been something that's been worked on for a couple weeks.
[07:00.50]The second channel, I'm pleased to announce, is bringing on, I think, four new editors.
[07:08.12]I have brought on a third party to really make that process easier.
[07:12.65]There are now six fucking editors, I believe, for the second channel.
[07:16.87]The backlog is going to get wiped the fuck out.
[07:18.63]There's going to be a ton of new content, probably every single day.
[07:24.38]Depending how long it takes.
[07:26.44]I'm not sure how long it will be.
[07:29.27]But we have brought on, at least in a temporary sense, a bunch of people to help really smash through that content.
[07:39.97]So although you won't be seeing my face on stream over the next two or three weeks, the second channel is going to be ripe with fresh fruit.
[07:51.33]I wanted to make sure that was available.
[07:52.75]And also, on top of that, there are some much larger projects that have just barely got off the ground.
[07:59.85]Are just starting to happen.
[08:00.91]Just starting to be talked about.
[08:03.20]And I gotta get healthy.
[08:05.78]If I wanna do the shit that I wanna do over the summertime here, into like the late summer, early fall, I can't just... I gotta get this shit done.
[08:14.92]I gotta just rip the fucking band-aid off.
[08:16.44]Let's go.
[08:18.50]Had a long time coming.
[08:23.99]I wanted to tell you.
[08:26.15]I didn't want to text it to you.
[08:28.77]I wanted to tell it to you behind the computer screen.
[08:36.57]Real life House Flipper?
[08:42.00]There's a lot that's happening.
[08:44.81]I've talked to my doctor, I've talked to my producer, my friend that's really been brought on board to help with a lot of this.
[08:52.16]I wanna hit this shit hard.
[08:55.36]And I can't do that right now.
[08:57.48]So, I'm gonna just go off the grid for a few weeks.
[09:02.47]And this is all I'm gonna focus on.
[09:03.75]And when I come back,
[09:06.62]I will have been at least told definitively what my real treatment plan is going to do for whatever this is.
[09:13.82]And like I said, it could be so simple.
[09:15.78]It could be so easy.
[09:17.02]This could go away in a week if I get it figured out.
[09:21.88]But I don't want to have it negatively affect... I don't want to get long-winded here.
[09:24.85]And a lot of money is coming in right now.
[09:26.89]And I want to address it, but I also want to address this before I do that.
[09:30.47]That... I... This is... I'm going to be just fine.
[09:33.49]I've... Don't worry about me.
[09:36.01]Don't worry about financially.
[09:37.27]Don't worry about giving me a bunch of money and shit.
[09:39.17]Don't... It's not necessary.
[09:40.67]Don't do it.
[09:41.57]It's completely unnecessary.
[09:44.85]Even though you are, a lot of you are.
[09:47.27]Don't worry about it.
[09:48.44]I'm just fine financially.
[09:50.66]I'm just fine mentally.
[09:52.54]I'm just not so quite fine physically.
[09:55.34]Right?
[09:56.84]Don't worry.
[10:04.12]Give him money.
[10:09.94]Oh, so money.
[10:11.92]God damn it.
[10:13.01]No.
[10:13.23]No.
[10:15.03]But we're gonna move on.
[10:15.79]I wanted to take the first, like, 10 to 20 minutes or so here to really talk about this.
[10:22.66]And I... I don't want this to turn into... Because this is... When I first... I hate talking about medical shit.
[10:29.20]I hate talking... Because then it's just like, oh, well, something's really wrong with him now.
[10:33.00]Oh, no, it's... Oh, I told you guys.
[10:35.31]I told you guys that he's wicked fucked up.
[10:37.17]It's like, no, I... I just wanted to... I just gotta get this taken care of.
[10:43.27]I know, and it doesn't matter what I say, because I know there's gonna be people that are gonna be like, well, here's what I think it is.
[10:48.29]Going by, by, uh, by degree in fucking neuroscience, I think he's got three weeks to live.
[10:56.36]Don't worry.
[10:56.90]Don't do that.
[11:04.12]Like, I don't want to see, like, Reddit threads over the next two or three weeks.
[11:07.54]Going over like, well, you know.
[11:10.04]I did notice that he had a little bit of a limp on his right shoulder there from six or seven months ago.
[11:17.79]I'm telling you, I think I know what it is.
[11:19.21]Uh-oh.
[11:22.71]It's completely unnecessary.
[11:27.21]But, community content night.
[11:29.47]We got a lot of artwork.
[11:31.21]We've got Reddit doctors.
[11:37.72]uh my I'm on a strict no comedy diet so anytime you hear me laugh it's going to sound really weird I'm going to be very very cautious about laughing it's going to be like
[11:53.84]I told you, I was sitting there.
[11:54.84]I was lying down and I saw... And I'll just spoil it because it's fucking hilarious.
[11:59.76]Somebody took the dinosaur walking with Thor's hammer thing.
[12:05.79]And they knew how much I love baseball.
[12:08.99]And they made the dinosaur hit a baseball.
[12:14.05]That's not what I...
[12:16.43]And it like came back and hit me in the face.
[12:18.07]It was just... I gotta take a comedy vacation.
[12:21.91]And not even like a medical leave or whatever you want to call it.
[12:26.77]But... I know that you guys understand.
[12:30.11]And I don't have to talk about it anymore.
[12:31.62]I just... I don't want to get long-winded on it.
[12:35.56]And I know I take breaks on this channel.
[12:39.90]Just like last month, I was gone for like two weeks.
[12:43.10]I know.
[12:44.20]I don't mean to do that.
[12:47.36]But sometimes they're completely necessary, and this is one of those times that I have to do it.
[12:56.14]And that's all I'm going to say.
[13:00.05]So let's go through how many people have just given huge amounts of money.
[13:03.61]Zap gave 20 community subs, which is insane.
[13:06.83]Our Lactary Lich, $100.
[13:08.13]Whatever happens, Jerma, we all hope you get better.
[13:09.67]You're super entertaining.
[13:12.20]Let me get back to 100%.
[13:15.36]Just hold on a minute.
[13:16.08]Just hold on.
[13:17.20]Let me, like, put some gas in the tank.
[13:20.89]Let's get back to 100%.
[13:21.37]We'll see.
[13:21.75]Thanks for the 100 bucks, though.
[13:24.91]That's a lot of money.
[13:27.43]Jacobin, thanks for 100 bucks.
[13:28.77]I still don't understand how this works.
[13:30.20]Well, you just gave me $100 in bits.
[13:32.28]I hope you weren't trying to give me $1.
[13:33.60]Otherwise, you gave me 100 of them.
[13:37.06]But I do appreciate it.
[13:37.78]That's a lot of money.
[13:39.58]Thank you.
[13:41.87]For Liddy, 20 community subs.
[13:43.31]Pauly Hex, 20 community subs.
[13:46.14]It's just a ton of money.
[13:47.08]Thank you.
[13:49.36]Thank you.
[13:50.08]Any Nep subs here.
[13:52.08]Smug.
[13:52.56]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[13:53.68]5 community subs from Producers Ascent.
[13:57.81]$50 from Transcout TF2.
[13:59.39]Thank you.
[14:01.06]They say these are not pity bits.
[14:03.87]I'm just happy you're back tonight and that you're taking time for yourself and your health.
[14:06.59]Good luck in figuring stuff out.
[14:09.23]And also finding a treatment that works.
[14:11.39]I made you a card, too.
[14:12.51]Here's the link.
[14:13.37]Yeah, and... You guys made cards for me before.
[14:17.67]This has been a long-running arc here that I really can't wait until the book is closed.
[14:26.85]Once the book closes... Oh.
[14:30.29]I'm going to be going a thousand miles per hour.
[14:34.41]Thank you for the $50.
[14:35.11]That's a huge amount of money.
[14:36.59]Another huge amount of money, which is completely unnecessary.
[14:39.23]Again, I want to make that really clear.
[14:41.55]I know a lot of you guys are probably thinking, oh, he's not going to be around for like a few weeks.
[14:46.55]Oh, I better give him a ton of money now.
[14:48.09]No, don't.
[14:48.59]Don't.
[14:50.11]I'll be back.
[14:53.17]Don't worry about it.
[14:54.69]Please.
[14:54.91]Please.
[15:00.18]I said they're not pity bits.
[15:01.72]I know they're not.
[15:03.36]It doesn't... I still... But I... Thank you.
[15:11.59]I really appreciate it.
[15:12.45]Jamie, thanks for the five subs.
[15:13.69]Philip Rivers, five subs.
[15:15.99]Hallowed Guru, ten subs.
[15:17.45]Mickey Music.
[15:18.47]Mikey Music, ten subs.
[15:20.61]Kai Straw, five subs.
[15:23.35]And then $42 from Clammy Bob.
[15:25.33]I did this for the Epic Badge.
[15:26.73]Thank you, all of you.
[15:29.59]I'll be back.
[15:31.09]And that's all I'm gonna say about it.
[15:35.62]That's it.
[15:36.88]I think I've taken enough time to go over this and really, really put the point across a bunch of times.
[15:43.25]Second channel's gonna have a shitload of content, bunch of new editors, bunch of new stuff.
[15:48.33]I am going to be gone for a little while.
[15:52.37]But I'll be back.
[15:54.52]Hey, what do you say we do some of the artwork?
[15:57.14]This is community content night and we're going to go over community content.
[16:02.54]Oh, by the way, a lot of people probably were at what's going to happen with the green screen stuff.
[16:07.71]So instead of just dumping all of this on the end of another community content night, when I come back, no.
[16:14.48]There's gonna be another green screen just night where we just do green screen stuff.
[16:21.07]Otherwise, there's gonna be hundreds of videos just dumped right on the end of a community content night.
[16:28.24]So the idea is every time a DLC, every time a little green screen DLC pack comes out, I don't know, why am I phrasing it that way?
[16:35.38]But you know what I mean.
[16:36.88]We will do a night where we just do a bunch of them with rules, right?
[16:40.69]Like the last couple times.
[16:42.29]And then that footage is just available for you to put into any community content night video.
[16:47.25]Right?
[16:48.87]Dude, there's going to be another DLC pack?
[16:50.41]Yes.
[16:53.79]Yes.
[16:55.03]Let me get back to 100.
[16:58.45]let me get back to 100 not I can't I can't operate at 60 fucking 70 anymore and you know what also puts more effort into this and more brain power into this is when I actually do start to see people ask if I'm okay you know because then it gets me thinking like is that like people are asking
[17:22.41]Like, dude, is he alright?
[17:23.51]He kind of, like... I heard he's, like, in pain.
[17:26.15]He doesn't look that good.
[17:27.81]Like, fuck, man.
[17:28.85]Like, yeah.
[17:31.36]Like, I got it.
[17:33.04]It's time.
[17:33.74]You know what I mean?
[17:34.28]It's time.
[17:34.86]I can't just be like, oh, wear a brace and scream still and go and, like, scream at cars going by the rumors.
[17:43.06]Like, I... No.
[17:45.31]My mother would be mad at me if I continued.
[17:54.01]But, what do you say we get started?
[17:56.87]I do have some OSTs here.
[17:58.19]I don't want to spoil how many potential images there are.
[18:03.03]Why would I do that?
[18:05.67]But thanks for hearing me out and my long-winded, my long-winded lookabay speech.
[18:14.94]On the facecam, you idiot.
[18:19.70]Hey.
[18:21.70]there actually this is the perfect hair you want to know something here's something funny so before the green screen stream I actually Kim gave me a quarantine cut it looks awful no that no no no no wait let me back up Kim gave me a quarantine cut and I specifically tried to we were putting images up from the green screen and she was trying to like do the exact hair that I had
[18:51.93]I think it was pretty close.
[18:55.29]Oh, there's my handsome man.
[18:56.91]Thanks, mom.
[19:01.18]Alright, let's get started.
[19:02.26]This is good.
[19:03.22]I like the line work.
[19:05.70]Oh, here he goes again.
[19:06.40]Hey, you know, I like the line work.
[19:10.51]Wasn't I told to stop saying things about pictures?
[19:15.79]Oh, good lighting.
[19:16.79]Good line work.
[19:19.08]Looks good.
[19:20.18]Make sure you make... Don't forget to fucking do that.
[19:22.26]Some of you guys do.
[19:22.94]Alright, that's... This is, um... Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
[19:37.69]Which one is the bad one?
[19:40.13]Is Dr. Jekyll the evil one?
[19:41.99]That, like, kills people?
[19:43.19]Or is it Mr. Hyde?
[19:44.27]Is Mr. Hyde the evil one?
[19:47.44]They're both evil.
[19:48.54]Wait, they're both evil?
[19:51.69]Isn't Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde just like the Hulk, but 150 years ago?
[20:00.11]No.
[20:00.89]Wait, I thought Dr. Jekyll was like a scientist.
[20:05.02]And he drinks a potion and becomes Mr. Hyde.
[20:08.14]That's just where the Incredible Hulk got the idea from.
[20:09.86]He's a doctor.
[20:15.34]Doctors can be scientists, right?
[20:19.61]Here's Professor Layton in the Mystery Orb.
[20:24.63]This is very- this is special requested.
[20:29.74]Oh sorry, the Curious Village.
[20:33.34]He was a chiropractor.
[20:36.48]Wait.
[20:37.70]Hold on.
[20:39.76]What kind of doctor was Dr. Jekyll?
[20:44.18]Wait, is this a real person?
[20:51.23]Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
[20:52.61]Species human.
[20:59.32]Edward Hyde.
[21:03.88]Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
[21:04.70]This is important.
[21:08.88]Dr. Jekyll and his alternate personality, Mr. Hyde.
[21:11.24]Why does this look like green screen footage?
[21:17.25]From last weekend.
[21:22.43]Look at this!
[21:26.69]Like, didn't I get in this exact costume?
[21:42.40]Oh, okay.
[21:43.20]No comedy.
[21:44.96]Holy shit.
[21:46.02]Oh, mucka ass.
[21:47.81]Alright.
[21:49.01]It's Bugleberry.
[21:49.83]Okay.
[21:50.55]I'm on a strict diet of no comedy.
[21:53.25]I have to go like this every time.
[21:57.99]No laughing.
[21:59.87]Just go over it.
[22:00.77]It's a laugh in my head and go over how funny that is.
[22:02.79]That felt good.
[22:09.96]Okay, no funny.
[22:10.90]No funniness.
[22:12.02]Nothing funny.
[22:13.30]This is gonna be hard on community content night.
[22:14.78]This is gonna be crack videos.
[22:16.04]How am I not gonna laugh at crack videos?
[22:26.35]I like this.
[22:33.94]It's like just finished painting and walked out in the rain.
[22:39.24]That's like what I see.
[22:40.22]You know what I mean?
[22:40.68]Like the streaks of humanity.
[22:44.85]I'm not supposed to be doing this.
[22:45.59]I'm supposed to just say thank you and move to the next one.
[22:53.03]I'm not supposed to critique artwork.
[22:56.15]You're doing great.
[23:02.56]That wasn't a critique.
[23:03.44]That's me saying the mental rays of the sun.
[23:08.99]Thank you.
[23:10.03]Thank you.
[23:12.39]Heard a joke once, man goes to doctor, says he's depressed, says life seems harsh and cruel, says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain.
[23:21.25]The doctor says, treatment is simple, great streamer Jerma985 is in town tonight, go and see him.
[23:27.06]That should pick you up.
[23:28.44]Man bursts into tears and says, but doctor, I am Jerma985.
[23:32.10]Isn't this a famous Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde thing?
[23:42.58]Okay, stop.
[23:44.24]Stop, stop, stop.
[23:59.61]I can't fuck with you tonight.
[24:02.65]Oh, look at that.
[24:07.83]It's not Dr. Jekyll.
[24:09.70]Yes, it is.
[24:10.32]It's Dr. Jekyll.
[24:14.44]Wait, that's you?
[24:19.42]Holy shit, this is the dream that I had.
[24:22.59]Oh my god, this dream was insane.
[24:26.07]I had a dream that... Holy shit, this is gonna be crazy.
[24:30.69]I know a lot of people are gonna think I'm insane for this one.
[24:32.87]I have no idea why this was in the dream.
[24:35.65]Don't ask me why.
[24:36.27]I have no reason for this.
[24:38.44]Like, oh, well, let me interpret that.
[24:39.58]There's no... Don't interpret it.
[24:40.46]There's nothing there.
[24:42.30]Um...
[24:45.24]I don't know how we led to this but like but Donald Trump was like on the ground like a like like crying on the ground he was like this big just like this big on the ground he was just like like a like a hurt animal or something
[25:02.90]And I walked up and I was like, oh my god!
[25:05.00]And I, like, scooped him up and I, like, put him, like, here.
[25:07.96]And his head was here and he, like, pushed his head and it was just like... Like... And I'm like, oh my god, what happened?
[25:15.03]I gotta take you to, like, an orphanage or something.
[25:18.55]I have no idea.
[25:21.33]I don't... I don't... I don't understand why.
[25:30.47]What the fuck?
[25:31.03]I don't know.
[25:31.47]I told you that I don't...
[25:34.18]I don't know.
[25:34.60]+2.
[25:38.82]If that's not a joke, that's a real dream.
[25:40.50]Is that a- is that a joke dream?
[25:44.37]Bring him to an orphanage.
[25:48.89]Death stranding but with a Trump baby.
[26:04.16]It's a good photo.
[26:07.40]Speaking of politicians, 1991 delegates needed to win.
[26:13.26]Apparently, I'm in the lead.
[26:15.40]What's going on here?
[26:18.16]Why have I not won my home state of Nevada?
[26:21.72]What's going on there?
[26:24.26]How do you win California and Utah, but not Nevada?
[26:26.38]I don't understand.
[26:33.55]It's not even your hometown.
[26:34.79]I know.
[26:36.04]But it is now.
[26:37.84]Because, like, I live here now.
[26:42.12]And all I can say, I grew up in Nevada.
[26:44.84]You don't know, I could have had an adolescent fucking child brain until like a year ago.
[26:48.72]Like, I grew up here.
[26:50.72]I finally grew up.
[26:54.58]Two gamers, will they ever play together again?
[27:05.38]You put that there because you knew I was going to see it and you knew I was going to be like, what is this?
[27:09.89]Why am I in the penis thing?
[27:13.95]Never going to play it again.
[27:15.79]That's not true.
[27:16.51]I have to find something to do.
[27:19.28]Just wait till I come back at 100.
[27:22.40]I don't think you know.
[27:26.40]I don't think you know what Jeremy at 100 is like.
[27:29.85]I'm not sure you can handle it.
[27:30.77]Maybe you can.
[27:38.35]Very good.

[29:14.39]And the Hobgoblin throws the... The Green Goblin has those, like, green batarangs, right?

[31:44.43]Okay.
[31:45.07]Alright, here we go.
[31:45.55]Yeah, look at this.
[31:47.50]The jermaPop.
[31:51.28]The best ice cream ever.
[31:55.88]I know some of you guys are going to say that like, oh, this must be coffee flavored ice cream.
[31:59.00]No, disgusting.
[31:59.72]Get it out of here.
[32:03.06]No coffee ice cream.
[32:03.88]I love coffee and I love ice cream.
[32:05.06]I don't like the two of them together.
[32:07.77]Because coffee ice cream is just a liar.
[32:13.13]It's a pretender to me.
[32:14.63]It's like, no, I like to drink coffee.
[32:17.80]I like caffeine.
[32:18.60]I like to get myself going.
[32:19.60]Eating ice cream that tastes like coffee is a liar.
[32:22.92]It's not going to keep you going.
[32:24.40]It's just like made with some beans.
[32:25.68]It's made with like 2% coffee or something.
[32:27.40]Not even real.
[32:29.10]Or it's like coffee flavoring.
[32:31.00]It's like when those motherfuckers add smoke flavoring to food.
[32:35.81]No.
[32:36.17]No.
[32:37.22]Oh yeah, that's a real brisket.
[32:39.36]Oh, is it, sir?
[32:42.38]Smoked fucking flavoring.
[32:46.68]It was hu- oh my god.
[32:52.39]Holy- what happened to the music?
[32:54.27]I don't know.
[32:56.49]Oh, this is Sly Cooper now.
[32:58.11]Okay, well, I'm into this.
[33:01.35]This just turned into the Sly Cooper OST.
[33:05.30]Freddie Dredd just drove by the stream and gave $350.
[33:10.58]Holy shit.
[33:16.46]Can't watch the stream.
[33:18.37]Hope you feel better after last stream.
[33:20.05]Those spins were next level.
[33:25.93]Back at $100.
[33:26.21]Thanks for the $350 in bits.
[33:30.57]That's insane.
[33:35.31]That's insane.
[33:39.28]That's too much money.
[33:41.20]That's 35,000 bits.
[33:42.34]That's pocket change for Freddy.
[33:52.19]Don't make me laugh.
[33:53.97]I told you.
[33:54.61]I'm on a strict no comedy diet.
[34:01.10]And then Lakronda, not to be overshadowed at all, I don't want to make it sound like that.
[34:05.23]That's $100 from Lakronda.
[34:06.79]Streamer, streamer, pumpkin eater.
[34:14.66]Is that a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde reference?
[34:21.64]Laugh, idiot.
[34:30.25]You've ruined it.
[34:31.27]Jerma, are you fucking dumb?
[34:33.07]Jerma, you're fucking dumb.
[34:34.54]Stop.
[34:38.44]Okay.
[34:38.72]Dude, I was lying back in my bed and I was watching the dinosaur hits the baseball back into the pitcher thing with the door hammer.
[34:49.35]And I could feel I could feel my bottom rib like It was horrible.
[35:03.87]What?
[35:12.17]Wait, like I'm lying back?
[35:14.25]What do you mean?
[35:14.73]What the fuck did you do?
[35:20.91]Stop looking at us like that.
[35:22.09]Well, what?
[35:22.85]What do you think I was talking about?
[35:24.05]We're talking about lying back in my bed watching the green... What were you watching?
[35:42.67]Yep.
[35:43.99]This is kind of what it was like.
[35:45.47]I was like holding... I was holding a baby.
[35:54.65]No shirt?
[36:01.05]No.
[36:01.69]I had clothes on.
[36:02.89]Alright, I... I'm losing my place again.
[36:14.04]That's gonna haunt my dreams.
[36:20.41]Yeah, kinda like it fucking haunted mine.
[36:23.47]What happened to my hair already?
[36:24.95]Alright, we gotta get back to this.
[36:28.43]I've lost my place again.
[36:29.41]Alright, no more comedy edits.
[36:33.01]No more edits.
[36:34.15]No more putting my face on other people's faces and Donald Trump's face on other Donald Trump's faces.
[36:37.95]No more of that.
[36:40.34]My dog's just watching the stream right now, and he's just sitting there going, you fucking idiot.
[36:44.48]What did we talk about?
[36:45.48]By the way, can you fix that fucking like weird surfer hair?
[36:52.06]Why is it so much longer on this side?
[36:54.09]What happened here?
[36:59.45]I am like the hair that the surfboard goes on to have fun.
[37:05.49]There should be like a little guy right here going like, oh, cowabunga, dude.
[37:08.80]Here we go.
[37:09.46]Look at this.
[37:13.70]Dye my hair blue and put a little guy on the surfboard on it.
[37:22.04]Here.
[37:23.02]That's a good fucking cringy photo.
[37:25.61]What am I doing?
[37:26.25]Right.

[37:31.53]I have to get rid of it before it-

[37:34.87]It's going to show up again.
[37:36.43]Okay, get rid of this.
[37:37.57]Get rid of this.
[37:38.07]Get rid of the Donald Trump edits.
[37:39.37]They're going to just randomly appear.
[37:41.79]Okay, let's go back to what we were doing.
[37:43.07]Thanks for the art.
[37:43.77]Thank you.
[37:49.07]Ah, it's me as Elvis shaking hands with President Richard Nixon.
[37:54.08]I guess.
[38:05.39]It's real.
[38:06.11]More politics.
[38:07.03]Is that politics?
[38:07.75]How is that politics?
[38:09.07]It was just Richard Nixon.
[38:12.17]Richard Nixon is not politics anymore.
[38:13.75]Richard Nixon was a meme back in the 70s.
[38:17.13]He turned into... That's what the memes were made of Richard Nixon.
[38:19.68]Now he's a meme.
[38:24.22]What do you mean spoilers?
[38:25.60]Spoilers for American historical presidential stuff.
[38:30.60]No.
[38:31.32]Guys, it's not a spoiler.
[38:32.22]That's an education.
[38:40.52]Okay.
[38:42.80]What is this?
[38:44.34]We're at a gallery here.
[38:45.22]Oh, look.
[38:45.60]It's auto.
[38:47.06]I see auto.
[38:48.12]I instantly upvote.
[38:49.82]Where's the upvote button?
[38:51.65]Where's the upvote button?
[38:52.59]Where is it?
[38:52.91]I don't see it.
[38:56.25]Oh, please.
[38:56.75]Come on.
[38:57.03]Give me that one.
[38:59.25]Bugleberry.
[38:59.81]Of course.
[39:03.49]We need an auto emote.
[39:05.67]You got one already, don't you?
[39:08.26]This is the one for B-T-T-V-D.
[39:10.76]Better twitch.tv.
[39:13.16]B-T-T-V, right?
[39:18.49]B-T-D-V-D.
[39:21.97]How about H-D-D-V-D?
[39:24.17]Oh, fuck.
[39:24.53]That would suck to be one of the people that ran one of those companies.
[39:29.15]Damn.
[39:31.02]Blu-ray and H-D-D-V-D?
[39:32.60]Yeah.
[39:33.06]Imagine you were like, oh man, this is a toss-up.
[39:36.58]That's rough.
[39:40.10]What is- what's going on with the music?
[39:44.14]Is this just me or does it sound like it's supposed to be a cell phone?
[39:48.14]Okay, that's better.
[39:49.10]It's a little loud.
[39:50.78]Uh, I- I- it could have been me.
[39:53.03]I could have done this, I think.
[40:09.63]I'm not clicking on any more comedy yet.
[40:11.09]It's not right now.
[40:13.72]Can't hear it.
[40:14.18]At least you can.
[40:18.84]Getting close there.
[40:25.24]It's not comedy.
[40:26.40]How is this not going to be a comedy image?
[40:30.34]You said to do it.
[40:31.34]Oh, it's this.
[40:32.00]Okay, hold on.
[40:37.12]Look at Vessel.
[40:46.72]This looks like it could be... This is a real image.
[40:58.07]He looks like he's having a lot of fun.
[41:01.85]Tuber hair.
[41:02.84]Lizard hair.
[41:04.64]Wait till I come back.
[41:05.34]Now I have a haircut.
[41:09.72]I'm going back to short hair Jerma.
[41:13.07]I'm going back to short hair Jerma, because up here is getting a little too thin to be long.
[41:20.09]Short hair Jerma, back in... We'll see.
[41:25.28]Anyways, uh, thanks for that.
[41:30.06]Keep losing my fucking place.
[41:32.30]Keep adding images.
[41:33.28]Ah, ah, there we are.
[41:37.17]Ooh, look at this one.
[41:37.77]This one's sick.
[41:41.85]Jerma animal crossing.
[41:42.98]Jerma caught a rat.
[41:47.70]Not so giant now.
[41:49.04]This is cute.
[41:58.33]Minus one point.
[41:59.23]For what?
[41:59.55]Why am I getting minus one point?
[42:02.51]Is this TOS?
[42:09.95]The image.
[42:12.05]Oh, bottom left.
[42:13.73]Stop fucking with me.
[42:15.00]Oh, the last pic.
[42:19.36]Minus one.
[42:20.22]Whatever.
[42:23.64]Oh, this is a picture of Holy Mac.
[42:26.84]Just had to include it.
[42:28.12]Honestly, it reminded me of a scrumptious food.
[42:37.99]Do you know that you're a meme on TikTok?
[42:44.91]Where do I accept my award?
[42:46.01]Because guess what?
[42:49.09]If I got nominated for an award for most funniest meme on TikTok, I wouldn't go.
[42:55.83]I would live via satellite have Bugleberry accepted.
[43:00.05]And I would give one sentence.
[43:01.97]Like celebrities used to do.
[43:04.45]You could always tell when a celebrity didn't give a shit about some of the awards.
[43:08.11]But they were live via satellite.
[43:10.23]It was like, oh, thanks for the award.
[43:11.95]I just don't, I'm not fucking going to that.
[43:14.37]Hey, all you voters.
[43:17.45]Thanks so much for making me number one.
[43:19.39]Hey, check out my next movie.
[43:23.30]Bye.
[43:24.38]Thanks.
[43:26.42]You can always tell.
[43:28.20]I don't want to be there.
[43:29.14]Fuck that.
[43:31.73]Wait, where are they holding that?
[43:36.17]I don't want to go to LA.
[43:37.95]No, I'm comfortable here in Cincinnati.
[43:40.63]Oh, no.
[43:42.13]Wait, what's that?
[43:43.49]It's for a prestigious award?
[43:45.39]I'll zip on the first plane.
[43:47.11]I'll be there in a minute.
[43:51.70]But not for the Nickelodeon Teen Choice Award.
[43:56.52]Okay, somebody look this up.
[43:57.82]What's the percentage of people that accept an award live via satellite on the Nickelodeon Teen Choice Awards?
[44:05.86]It's like every other person.
[44:11.40]It's 100%.
[44:15.64]What the fuck?
[44:16.24]I'm not looking that up.
[44:17.38]Why?
[44:18.92]Why is that such a... Why is that such a risky thing to search?
[44:23.63]What?
[44:25.69]No, dude.
[44:26.27]I ain't looking that up.
[44:27.53]Nope.
[44:28.91]How many celebrities have gone live via satellite?
[44:31.93]Nope.
[44:32.05]Nope.
[44:34.12]Nope.
[44:35.18]No, that's too... I'm not doing that, dude.
[44:40.00]Where would we find that data?
[44:41.50]I don't know.
[44:41.86]Just go watch all of them.
[44:44.23]Stop.
[44:44.59]Imagine the person that's like, you know what?
[44:53.05]I'm gonna do that.
[44:54.15]I'm gonna watch every Nickelodeon Teen Choice Awards.
[45:00.98]We gotta... What is this?
[45:04.89]Jerma, it's 4 p.m.
[45:06.13]Time for your comedy.
[45:07.10]Okay, chat.
[45:08.78]Why did I open this?
[45:14.04]What is this?
[45:15.88]I don't get this.
[45:19.00]I don't know what this is.
[45:21.54]Jerma, it's 4 p.m.
[45:22.30]Time for your comedy.
[45:23.10]Okay, chat.
[45:27.40]I don't get it.
[45:28.26]What is that?
[45:32.45]It's a boring, ruined meme.
[45:42.11]It's because of dick flattening.
[45:45.83]Why did I say that like death stranding?
[45:47.99]Did you pick up on that?
[45:48.93]That was weird.
[45:50.12]Dick flattening.
[45:51.36]Death stranding.
[45:52.18]Like that's how everybody says the word.
[45:53.96]Death stranding.
[45:57.70]Right?
[45:57.88]Oh, I'm going to be playing death stranding.
[46:00.14]Dick flattening.
[46:01.90]Am I going crazy?
[46:02.70]I might be.
[46:03.40]But you know what I'm saying, right?
[46:08.15]Dick flattening.
[46:15.15]This music is fucking freaking me out.
[46:16.91]This is Sly Cooper?
[46:18.11]Okay, hold on.
[46:23.67]What?
[46:23.99]I lost my place again.
[46:31.10]Holy shit, that just, okay, I just skipped, and it scared the shit out of me.
[46:36.54]Look at that.
[46:37.10]Oh, spoilers!
[46:38.24]Oh, look at how many we have!
[46:39.30]Oh, no, no, you ruined it!
[46:44.14]Everybody knows there's like a hundred more things, and I couldn't see what they were.
[46:47.76]Tabs, holy shit, that's what happens.
[46:52.30]I can handle this many tabs when I have got a supercomputer.
[46:56.28]I don't have a supercomputer.
[46:59.21]In fact, I have a computer that's probably four or five years old.
[47:04.45]Five and a half years old.
[47:05.23]It's a 1080 in here, which is still good.
[47:07.49]Don't let anybody tell you you have to have one of the new ones.
[47:11.00]No, you don't.
[47:12.52]Graphics cards are like cell phones.
[47:14.42]You don't have to get one every fucking year.
[47:18.34]You're okay with an iPhone 6.
[47:19.66]Don't worry.
[47:20.62]You're okay with an iPhone 5.
[47:21.70]Oh, you're going to get the iPhone X. No, you don't.
[47:24.49]Why?
[47:24.63]Why?
[47:26.31]Why?
[47:28.01]Dude, do you know the RTX 2100 is coming out now?
[47:32.44]Okay, cool.
[47:33.62]You bought the RTX last year.
[47:34.78]Don't buy another graphics card for like five years.
[47:36.42]You're fine.
[47:36.72]What do you want to run?
[47:39.76]Like crisis on every monitor in your house?
[47:42.20]Who cares?
[47:42.64]1080 works just fine.
[47:52.19]You can have a 1080.
[47:54.82]and get very fine graphics and, like, at least 100 FPS on, like, almost every game you play.
[48:01.34]Now, I know people are gonna argue this here, and they're gonna go, Jerma, you're a fucking idiot.
[48:05.09]And I'm gonna go, whoa, it's easy.
[48:07.21]What's with the personal attack?
[48:08.81]And then they're gonna go on, they're gonna say, but you can't put on, like, refracting lighting and, like, S-S-A-O-S-S-A-O-A times five.
[48:16.30]Okay, I can't even tell when that's on.
[48:19.34]Like, when you go from, like, uh,
[48:23.44]Antrioscopic filtering times 16.
[48:24.94]So like times 8.
[48:26.50]I can't even see.
[48:27.56]I can't tell the difference.
[48:29.16]Like SSAO AO times 10.
[48:31.40]I don't even know.
[48:31.82]I can't tell the difference between that and like low quality.
[48:33.72]I can't.
[48:38.16]I can't.
[48:38.58]I'm just being honest.
[48:40.60]It's not real.
[48:44.82]Cut his mic.
[48:46.09]No.
[48:46.43]My point is that you don't need a 2080 to play like Counter-Strike.
[48:54.32]And that's what all you play.
[48:56.93]Why does everybody act like they need that card so bad?
[48:59.41]You know what I mean?
[48:59.91]Like, no, man, I gotta get a 2090 for Minecraft.
[49:07.10]Yeah, okay.
[49:07.78]They don't need a 2090 to play like fucking Stardew Valley.
[49:14.78]Is RTX in Minecraft?
[49:16.02]Yeah.
[49:20.31]Am I just going against... Am I just like one of those contrarian dicks that just goes against things that are like, well, man, it's like popular.
[49:28.88]Am I a contrarian dickhead?
[49:30.12]Dude, don't get the 2090 RTX.
[49:33.34]It's stupid.
[49:33.74]Get a 1080.
[49:33.96]It works just fine.
[49:34.80]I'm a contrarian dickhead.
[49:36.08]Like, am I?
[49:36.60]No?
[49:38.50]You're just a regular dickhead.
[49:41.97]Dude, you're so waste.
[49:51.68]That's literally the... By the way, we haven't even talked about what was on screen.
[49:55.62]This is like frog me.
[50:00.51]This is... I love this.
[50:02.93]This is like making me happy.
[50:05.99]And I'm doing that like... No, no, no.
[50:09.17]Not the one where I'm holding up a figurine on Reddit.
[50:12.03]I'm talking about like the... That is what that is.
[50:15.27]How do I do that without making that joke that everybody likes to make?
[50:20.44]No, hold on.
[50:23.16]No, fuck.
[50:24.28]That's everything.
[50:26.54]Guys, no one can ever open their mouth excitedly in a photo ever again.
[50:32.16]You understand?
[50:33.24]It's been destroyed.
[50:37.00]Anytime somebody is excited, don't ever be excited in a photo.
[50:40.20]Ever.
[50:41.22]If you're with a bunch of friends and it's for you, wow, I can't believe it.
[50:44.65]My friends, three of you guys made it out to Vegas and we're like, oh my god, we're out at one of the casinos.
[50:51.73]Get a photo.
[50:53.51]No, don't... Then people on the internet won't call me a bunch of fucking names.
[51:04.61]Like, no, what am I supposed to do?
[51:06.77]I'm going to be like... If I'm with like four friends and we're out fucking... Somebody just hit $100 on the slot machine, of course I'm going to make that face.
[51:17.30]You can never be excited in a fucking photo ever again.
[51:25.18]Anyways, I love this.
[51:26.36]Good job.
[51:33.78]Okay, the funniest part about this one is how I had to go back.
[51:36.70]I had to demagnify like four times.
[51:40.11]And the chin was still there.
[51:47.21]This chin is so big.
[51:48.55]That could be... That could be my neck.
[51:52.63]Like, I could be like...
[51:55.70]Like smiling with my neck back.
[51:58.38]But it's not.
[52:00.24]It's just huge.
[52:04.05]Keep going, keep going, keep going.
[52:08.09]Oh my god.
[52:08.67]Huge bits.
[52:11.21]More huge amounts of money.
[52:14.57]Oh my god.
[52:15.35]Another hundred fucking dollars.
[52:16.89]Another ten thousand bits.
[52:18.61]From Copper Coyote this time.
[52:21.37]Add it to the gigantic vault that sits behind me apparently.
[52:26.85]Thanks for the $100.
[52:28.85]They say, Thank you.
[52:48.17]I plan on getting back to 100.
[52:49.31]However long that takes.
[52:53.40]From this point now, until it's done.
[52:57.90]Because long term, I've been here a long time.
[52:59.90]I've been around, I've been on the internet, I've been a... It's still hard for me to even say the words.
[53:07.99]I sit here, I... Eclan, right?
[53:10.93]Eclan.
[53:11.53]I've been an Eclan for 10 years.
[53:13.27]And I'd like to do it for a lot longer.
[53:14.67]I'd like to continue.
[53:15.93]And I don't want to have this fester to a point where it starts to fuck up the stream, starts to fuck up my everyday life.
[53:22.75]And actually, I think this will be probably the first time that I've, in my own control, for my own reasons, have decided to take a leave.
[53:38.30]I don't think in 10 years I've ever said I'm not going to be around for three weeks.
[53:43.26]don't think it's happened sure there's been stuff where it had where I've had out of my control like internet problems when I first moved to Vegas that was like a two or three week period but I don't think I've stopped on my own um maybe one time when I was trying like transitioning from Twitch youtube to Twitch
[54:07.94]But I have to do it.
[54:09.84]And if this is the only time I have to do it, this is the only time I'm going to do it.
[54:15.95]Health problems are out of your control.
[54:19.33]Yeah, but they are, though.
[54:21.15]They are, kind of, because I can go take care of this shit.
[54:27.22]Like, I can go do this.
[54:28.80]I can go get this shit set up, and I can go get this taken care of, and I haven't really been active on it.
[54:34.35]I'm sure, oh, what about the colonoscopy and the upper endoscopy you had?
[54:38.53]Yeah, but they were, that shit was like six months apart from each other.
[54:43.04]Like, I could have just been like, go, go, go, go, go, and had those, tried to line those up in a month period.
[54:53.34]We got a one-man spam.
[54:55.70]Where?
[54:55.92]Fucking go, go, go, go, go.
[55:00.15]Colonoscopy speedrun.
[55:04.58]But this is great.
[55:05.68]Thank you.
[55:06.76]Wonderful.
[55:08.94]I love it.
[55:11.33]Oh, look at that!
[55:24.57]Bomb man.
[55:25.76]Ice man.
[55:27.00]Guts man?
[55:29.38]Putt man.
[55:30.34]Elec man.
[55:31.26]And fire man.
[55:34.49]I would play this game.
[55:38.05]I really would.
[55:40.69]Imagine Mega Man, but it was like this.
[55:48.35]Look at this dude.
[55:51.11]Someone make this.
[55:53.05]Well, that's quite a task.
[55:57.73]It's just Mega Man.
[56:00.71]But Mega Man frustrates me.
[56:03.58]Because...
[56:05.89]Mega Man's one of the only games that is just trial and error.
[56:12.36]That... I don't... That's not true.
[56:15.98]A lot of games are trial and error.
[56:16.84]I don't like the trial and error.
[56:18.12]I don't like to go to Iceman's level and be like, oh, can I shoot him with my regular buster?
[56:23.64]Nope, I need to go to the fire level first.
[56:25.76]You gotta play Pokémon.
[56:30.11]And then you have to figure out who the one guy is that can take damage in the first level from your regular blaster.
[56:37.75]Just suck.
[56:41.56]Pokémon's fun.
[56:42.22]No, I'm saying, like, fire versus ice.
[56:44.22]Ice versus Earth.
[56:45.16]Earth versus wind.
[56:46.36]Wind defeats bomb.
[56:47.98]Right?
[56:50.12]Like, ice defeats fire.
[56:52.12]Fire defeats Earth.
[56:54.40]Earth defeats cut.
[56:55.78]Cut defeats electric.
[56:56.98]Because it cut the fucking electricity wire.
[56:58.64]And then wire... And then electricity goes into the... Blows out the candles and blows out the bomb.
[57:05.88]Thanks for the art.
[57:08.92]You alright?
[57:09.54]No.
[57:12.94]Oh, here's some donkey donuts.
[57:15.51]Because you're a rabbit.
[57:18.15]Cut the fuse to the bomb.
[57:20.61]Oh, you're right.
[57:24.19]Do the voice?
[57:24.73]I can't.
[57:26.89]I feel like we've heard the same song for 30 minutes.
[57:28.36]We're gonna skip ahead here.
[57:37.25]Here's some beer burger because you're epic.
[57:40.47]People still love this, huh?
[57:44.41]Yeah, it activates by ribcage.
[57:46.01]I can't.
[57:52.22]Isn't that the star emote?
[57:54.48]That's Starberg, right?
[57:56.36]Am I mistaken here?
[58:02.48]Evil.
[58:12.88]I told you I don't like drinking on camera.
[58:16.46]I act like a weirdo.
[58:17.98]And I pretend to drink.
[58:19.24]I do like, oh, I'm acting.
[58:21.98]I'm like pretending.
[58:22.80]Just drink.
[58:23.65]I don't know why.
[58:24.57]It's only when the camera's on.
[58:27.39]You're a fucking alien.
[58:29.57]Talk show.
[58:32.01]Yeah, that was cool.
[58:32.67]Like, yeah.
[58:34.60]Filming's going great.
[58:39.72]Hey, what do you put in here anyways?
[58:41.92]Hey, what do you put in this?
[58:44.21]What is this anyways?
[58:45.01]They always ask that.
[58:45.77]Why?
[58:51.31]What do you put in this, Conan?
[58:55.15]There ain't nothing in those cups.
[59:07.26]420.
[59:07.28]69.
[59:07.46]Nice.
[59:08.54]Speaking of... I gotta shave.
[59:17.34]Speaking of shaving.
[59:21.76]I forgot that I actually did that.
[59:23.12]That was dumb.
[59:24.22]That was a lot.
[59:25.18]How many was that?
[59:25.62]A thousand times?
[59:26.56]I went a thousand times?
[59:27.62]Something like that?
[59:34.34]Why is this a ha-ha?
[59:36.98]It was 550.
[59:37.28]What do you mean?
[59:54.73]I don't have much to say.
[59:55.85]Absolutely destroyed on red wine.
[59:57.57]Look at that hair.
[60:05.69]Kylo Ren.
[60:06.49]I actually was trying not to laugh because there's a couple of Kylo Rens in this that are very, very funny.
[60:13.21]They're very funny.
[60:14.83]They're hard for me to not eat.
[60:17.45]And then go cheat on my comedy diet.
[60:21.14]This is great though.
[60:21.80]This is fucking hilarious.
[60:23.92]Okay, for a second I was just like, this is bad!
[60:25.46]This is like naked person or something.
[60:27.72]But no, this is a... I saw this down here and I was just like, I gotta click off this.
[60:34.69]my facecam I was looking over here originally and my facecam was blocking it and I'm like okay this is a bad thing now this is Murius Murius what Murius you know what to do throw the rocket people I forgot I that was that was so much fun I love that game
[61:03.16]He didn't mean to, like, throw rocks at people.
[61:05.40]He was just acting out.
[61:06.58]We just... It's... What a great game.
[61:12.60]You hate me.
[61:18.15]Good old Murius.
[61:20.43]Oh, this is cool.
[61:20.91]Somebody made this out of clay.
[61:21.77]Somebody actually made a clay fireman.
[61:29.50]Bob for sale oh no I was like Bob for scale I was like wait you're selling Bob that's really good actually scale buy buy buy buy
[61:51.25]You know the line.
[61:52.69]You know the line.
[61:53.77]When I get back.
[61:55.43]1-0-0.
[61:57.25]You know it.
[61:58.87]See.
[62:00.37]Merch.
[62:00.73]Do more merch.
[62:01.51]I know.
[62:02.15]I know.
[62:02.49]I know.
[62:02.77]I know.
[62:02.99]I just don't.
[62:03.79]I know.
[62:05.55]I know.
[62:06.13]I'm gonna.
[62:08.12]I love this.
[62:08.58]This is my favorite.
[62:09.56]I know this is like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and like, oh no, here's a JoJo reference.
[62:13.82]But it's me as the Riddler, so it gets an automatic plus one.
[62:19.29]I really feel like I could be the... If they ever cast the Riddler in an upcoming movie, I'm talking to you.
[62:26.03]I'm talking to you, J.R.R.
[62:27.21]Tolkien.
[62:28.57]If you ever cast anybody in as the Riddler, I'm ready.
[62:33.03]I'm ready for my performance.
[62:37.19]I'll be ready.
[62:40.73]He's dead.
[62:49.04]The wings.
[62:52.81]Spoiler.
[63:05.46]Can I dye my hair black?
[63:08.80]Wait a minute.
[63:13.45]No, it would look weird.
[63:19.27]God, no.
[63:20.37]Emo hair.
[63:22.55]Would it be emo hair?
[63:29.46]Shave.
[63:30.22]I will.
[63:30.70]Just give me... Give me a little bit.
[63:33.86]It would be Spider-Man 3.
[63:43.90]I mean, if I had the Venom suit, I wouldn't get rid of it.
[63:47.14]Let's just put it that way.
[63:57.30]Evil. No! I would be able to control it!
[64:01.09]I would control that beast. I would control it.
[64:03.09]You're telling me you got- I get extra superpowers? I would control that. Are kidding me?
[64:11.09]You know- what you- well you guys don't think that like that the Venom symbiote would like attach in here and get up there and like when we're sleeping have the Donald Trump the baby dream and not be like: okay I gotta fucking listen to what this guy says.
[64:22.09]This guy's fucking weird and crazy and I- I gotta listen to this dude now.
[64:28.09]Like, oh, yeah, the dream of, like, when I dropped two ice creams on the ground and ate them both off the ground.
[64:34.31]Like, holy shit.
[64:36.01]Okay.
[64:37.39]What do you want to do?
[64:40.25]We're going to be good.
[64:41.93]We're going to be good guys.
[64:43.73]And if you do anything bad, then you're going to be in trouble.
[64:46.61]But I still do what I want and what I think is right.
[64:50.73]We're going to be good about it.
[64:53.55]Every single person that's ever wanted to be a villain or has talked about how they see themselves as a villain speaks like this.
[65:03.01]We're good, though, but we're bad at the same time.
[65:09.20]That's a good Riddler?
[65:10.08]No, they don't.
[65:13.16]Play a different song.
[65:14.52]Was that a good Riddler?
[65:32.95]I don't like this whole Riddler's smart thing.
[65:35.69]If you leave Loose for the police, you're a fucking idiot.
[65:39.47]Oh, he's a million IQ, huh?
[65:50.78]This is fucking scary.
[65:58.76]But no, I'm a good guy, though.
[66:02.59]Forget that this comic book is not a good representation of me.
[66:14.92]Alright.
[66:15.60]What are you guys doing?
[66:16.98]Why are we getting more links?
[66:19.12]I've seen this already.
[66:33.21]Very inaccurate, because I'm scared of this.
[66:37.05]I'm scared to do this.
[66:43.08]I'll never have a tattoo.
[66:44.48]I'll never have a piercing.
[66:46.34]Because I'm scared of what happens here.
[66:48.88]Do it on stream.
[66:56.40]Why would I get my ears pierced on stream?
[67:01.47]Wrong link.
[67:02.37]What?
[67:24.17]Ow.
[67:24.55]Is this Doom?
[67:26.06]No, it's not Doom.
[67:29.36]Why would you think this was Doom?
[67:47.21]Don't ever be excited again.
[67:48.45]Don't ever have any excited face.
[67:54.74]Somebody on the internet will draw stitches all down your neck.
[67:59.18]Give you weird glasses.
[68:14.45]What do I look like here?
[68:15.83]This mouth in particular.
[68:19.00]This is going to take a minute.
[68:21.80]This is a person.
[68:23.56]That mouth and this, like, the nose.
[68:28.71]It's like a celebrity or something.
[68:39.97]Who is this?
[68:41.91]Drumpf?
[68:44.11]Why did you just write Drumpf?
[68:46.55]Why did you just write that?
[68:52.11]Alright, this is... Alright, this is... Okay, thank you for your... But this is community content, and I... Pull links out of chat.
[69:02.14]This is community... It's community content.
[69:04.26]You're right.
[69:05.26]You're right.
[69:05.61]But let me go back to what I was doing, please.
[69:15.11]Lost my place again.
[69:17.95]I don't want to give spoilers.
[69:18.89]People are like, why did you turn it off?
[69:21.31]I don't want you to see what's next.
[69:22.43]Okay, here we are.
[69:26.01]Alright, let's go.
[69:31.14]I just don't want you to see what's next.
[69:34.16]It'll be a spoil.
[69:35.00]Yep.
[69:39.78]That's good.
[69:43.63]That's a real picture of Bugleberry.
[69:50.94]Quick, turn it off or you're losing viewers.
[69:59.99]That's so... I love this.
[70:06.37]I need to... I wanted to have him here more.
[70:11.37]Way more.
[70:13.86]Uh, Tiny Man's Pro Streamer 4.
[70:16.04]We got the short thing in there right off the bat.
[70:20.38]Very, very quickly, the first thing.
[70:27.51]This is also, I mean, this works because this is the, that's a look at me.
[70:35.37]So, this makes perfect sense.
[70:44.44]You hide anything else here?
[70:47.06]Ernie, fireman, giant rat, chicken, Jerma cheetos, beer, coffee, chat.
[70:52.34]Oh, yeah.
[70:52.74]Okay.
[70:54.66]This is all this and then Chad Muska.
[70:58.98]he's still in the game I think actually what happened is when they were editing this they got to this point where they did all these characters and then they just were like damn done yeah whatever I don't I don't I'm not gonna like mask and type another thing in here I don't care it could be Chad mosca that's fine
[71:25.58]You know, the best thing about art is people make you look way more handsome than you are in real life.
[71:30.62]That's the best part.
[71:32.96]You know what I mean?
[71:34.08]I look at this and I'm like, holy shit, look at that guy.
[71:37.45]And it's like, wow.
[71:40.27]I could, that's me.
[71:43.55]Yeah.
[71:45.11]Hey.
[71:52.10]Hey.
[71:56.86]That's me!
[72:00.36]You look like a Disney villain.
[72:02.80]But I'm good.
[72:03.62]I'm a good guy, and I do, but I might have some tendencies to do maybe my own stuff, what I want to do.
[72:09.82]But I'm good at heart.
[72:11.72]That's what you meant to say.
[72:12.50]What the fuck?
[72:19.02]Nice eyebrows.
[72:19.86]What's wrong with my eyebrows?
[72:24.78]What?
[72:34.56]Pores.
[72:35.72]Where?
[72:37.45]You can't see pores on this face.
[72:39.51]It's flawless.
[72:43.37]If there were pores on this face, that would mean that it wasn't a perfect fucking complexion of the utmost of absolute handsome human male.
[73:00.57]That one was free.
[73:02.21]Different Jerma hairstyles.
[73:03.45]We got young Jerma style with like a big fucking neck.
[73:06.99]I like the big neck.
[73:08.39]Wish I had the big neck back.
[73:09.43]I'll get it back.
[73:11.01]Sewer goblin style.
[73:12.57]Okay, so that was few weeks old haircut style and life is pain style.
[73:19.36]Which one are we at now?
[73:22.70]This one.
[73:24.68]Sewer goblin was like a few weeks ago.
[73:28.88]This is not super.
[73:30.04]That's not long enough.
[73:31.94]A few weeks ago, yes.
[73:34.93]Made by Jerma985.
[73:36.79]I didn't do this.
[73:42.83]I didn't make this.
[73:49.67]Also, tell this person that they should feel bad about emotes.
[73:53.62]They're emoting the Jerma Discord once he's there.
[73:56.04]Wow, don't do that.
[73:59.45]Don't put sneaky little instructions at the bottom for people.
[74:03.93]Don't like do sneaky little instructions.
[74:13.55]That's a pretty great Animal Crossing rug.
[74:17.11]I'm sure it is or it will be in about 30-40 seconds.
[74:26.46]Quick, somebody get the QR code.
[74:31.52]I think there actually is a few QR codes in this stream.
[74:34.28]Get ready.
[74:36.88]This is great, though.
[74:39.03]All the different stages of Fireman's emotions.
[74:42.67]We've got... Happy.
[74:44.25]A little derpy.
[74:46.11]Derpy.
[74:47.19]Derpy.
[74:48.55]Sad.
[74:50.07]Derpy.
[74:50.65]Is that... Oh, wait.
[74:51.95]Can you say derpy?
[74:52.83]Is that like a... Is that a band thing now, too?
[75:01.14]So don't ever show any excitement in any photos.
[75:04.14]And don't use words like derpy.
[75:06.14]Because that's... No.
[75:08.02]No, no, no, no, no.
[75:08.80]We don't use that.
[75:09.54]We don't use those words.
[75:12.68]True?
[75:12.94]Okay.
[75:19.07]Just... You're going to be banned for two to three weeks.
[75:23.65]Why would I get banned?
[75:26.07]I know I'm not going to be around for a little while, but that doesn't mean that, like, hey, guys, I'm not going to be around for a little while.
[75:32.12]Well, since I'm not going to be around, I might as well just, like, just be naked.
[75:40.79]Like, why would I... I was going to say something else, but I probably can't say that.
[75:49.47]What...
[75:55.72]Loaf of bread.
[75:56.26]I was going to say loaf of bread.
[75:59.12]Yeah, can you come to the... Can you figure out what he was actually saying?
[76:06.57]Wait, I have a rat-shaped sword?
[76:11.19]No, I was going to say asshole.
[76:14.25]I just said it!
[76:20.49]There's a lot of people here.
[76:21.45]I can't like protect... Okay, there's like 8,500 people here.
[76:26.56]It's not like I'm in a room with two of my friends and a fucking cat.
[76:29.74]You know what I mean?
[76:31.42]I got a cup of shit.
[76:42.33]No, it's just me.
[76:46.58]I love the championship belt.
[76:51.00]And the Pikachu socks.
[76:53.02]It's a nice touch.
[76:57.03]Nudes.
[76:57.45]I don't even know why this is here.
[77:11.09]I told you guys that I'm going to start this.
[77:12.30]There's going to be a criteria now.
[77:14.10]I've got to make a good flow with the artwork and the videos.
[77:17.98]And I start to condense down.
[77:20.14]Maybe... Sometimes some stuff just happens.
[77:26.77]You look like Bogdanoff.
[77:34.05]I think that's probably the intention.
[77:38.64]That's your real face.
[77:44.82]Ah, no.
[77:45.36]Excuse me.
[77:51.66]Okay, then.
[77:53.29]This is funny.
[77:54.51]Like...
[78:02.12]This is the thumbnail.
[78:02.98]Oh yeah, this is the thumbnail.
[78:06.08]Those things don't even look real.
[78:09.01]Is anybody else convinced that those aren't real?
[78:11.87]Those are little micro-machines.
[78:14.53]Those don't even look like real animals.
[78:18.32]Don't they look like they were made in a Bionicle kit?
[78:22.80]Or whatever those things were.
[78:24.48]This is not real.
[78:33.07]Have you seen these?
[78:33.67]I don't think... It's weird.
[78:35.69]Like, they have the eyes.
[78:36.49]I hate these things.
[78:37.45]I don't like looking at that.
[78:41.43]They're like robots.
[78:43.57]Prove that they're real.
[78:44.94]I can't.
[78:45.30]How am I supposed to do that?
[78:53.90]5G bits.
[78:54.84]Alright, this is freaking me out.
[78:57.56]I gotta get this off.
[79:00.41]I'm not sure which one of these is potentially a more scary image.
[79:03.21]You know... I want to do an experiment.
[79:15.96]The experiment's going to be, this is very high quality work, by the way.
[79:19.32]The experiment's going to be, we're going to go very fast, at the end of the artwork, we're going to go very fast through each one of these pieces.
[79:26.78]And how many of them am I in a good mood or happy?
[79:31.50]How many can we find that are not, this guy's scary and he's going to strangle you?
[79:36.98]Or this guy is about to throw a punch in your face or mid-punch?
[79:42.32]Are there any, like, this guy is not out of his mind photos?
[79:45.96]I know this has been, like, four.
[79:49.75]This is very high quality, though.
[79:51.67]This is great.
[79:59.83]Big Bits?
[80:00.45]Oh, fuck.
[80:01.69]You're right.
[80:03.23]Oh, there is Big Bits.
[80:03.97]Hold on.
[80:05.35]Snooze and Cockta gave $50.
[80:07.47]The music's off?
[80:08.73]Why does this keep happening?
[80:10.65]Alright, new OST.
[80:11.49]First thing that I see is going on.
[80:13.17]First thing that I... Right in the elbow.
[80:21.47]Right in, like, that spot that makes your whole body tingle.
[80:26.75]Right in that, like, wedge right here.
[80:29.05]Right in the fucking wedge where it's like... It was, like, right in the fucking corner.
[80:36.11]Okay.
[80:37.83]Okay, first thing I see.
[80:41.30]Terraria, okay.
[80:42.94]Terraria soundtrack.
[80:43.81]Terraria OST.
[80:45.67]Okay, there it is.
[80:49.65]I can't wait for the... No.
[80:50.65]Better.
[80:51.55]Better.
[80:52.19]It's got to be on tune.
[80:54.57]I can't just... That was fucking terrible.
[81:11.79]What's this?
[81:13.45]This is not the song that I wanted to hear.
[81:22.34]This is not the song I wanted.
[81:28.47]You're skipping.
[81:29.35]Skipping.
[81:29.81]Skipping.
[81:33.29]There.
[81:34.61]Go back, go back, go back.
[81:35.73]Alright, alright, alright, it's not fair.
[81:37.45]Snoozycopter, 50 fucking dollars.
[81:39.78]I gotta stop swearing, too.
[81:40.64]No more swears.
[81:41.94]Here are some pity bits.
[81:43.24]No, but for real.
[81:45.80]I want you to play this soundtrack.
[81:47.14]I think you'll like it.
[81:49.05]Hold on, let's see.
[81:49.61]Is this an OST?
[81:58.15]This is...
[82:01.15]Alter Ego NES music.
[82:03.75]Alright, we'll queue it up.
[82:05.47]Oh yeah, this is the one that I wanted.
[82:06.95]This reminds me of a bunch of little guys working on a construction site.
[82:11.82]Like little trucks going like... Like remember those little guys with the mustaches in the Fraggles TV show?
[82:20.18]They were moving and working and they were building stuff out of these weird crystal sugar structures.
[82:24.40]That's what I think these guys work to.
[82:27.32]Those guys were... Yeah, the Dozers!
[82:30.11]The Doozers!
[82:32.30]Dozers yes Those structures were like made it at such weird material the dozers Anyways, hold on by with a lot of money

[82:46.18]Red gold.
[83:12.66]Well, thank you, Snoozen.
[83:13.40]That's a ton of fucking money.
[83:15.00]And we will play Alter Ego NES music after this.
[83:19.89]Hey, Javelin, thanks for the $50.
[83:21.33]Another $50 drop.
[83:22.69]Just a bit.
[83:23.25]Just another 5,000 bits.

[83:27.21]Just coming down.
[83:29.43]Uh, from Javelin.
[83:30.25]Thank you, Javelin.
[83:30.89]They say, Jerm, I've been watching you since about 2012.
[83:33.05]Long time.
[83:34.50]It's not an understatement when I say that you've quite literally shaped my sense of humor for the rest of my life.
[83:38.98]Thank you so much for all that you do.
[83:40.30]Can't wait to see you back at 100.
[83:52.77]For recommissions, stop.
[83:57.35]I know I can go off camera and drink.
[84:00.04]I don't have to pretend.
[84:03.90]But seriously, that's a long time to be watching anybody.
[84:06.16]I'll be back.
[84:08.04]I'll be back at a fucking hundred.
[84:09.84]I ain't coming back at 90.
[84:11.17]I'll be back at 100.
[84:12.33]100.
[84:14.95]Anything less is unacceptable.
[84:19.83]Thank you.
[84:21.32]This has just been on screen the whole time.
[84:23.16]Okay, we gotta get this off before my mother shows up.
[84:28.69]Okay, I thought he was naked, but it's okay.
[84:31.75]Uh, this is... I look... I got like a hit on the... Am I like unconscious?
[84:43.68]Am I like... Did I get hit in the head?
[84:49.24]Go beyond...
[84:52.54]OH IT'S THE PLANETS IT'S THE PLANETS RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT FOR A SECOND I THOUGHT LIKE HE LIKE CAME BEHIND ME AND LIKE BONKED ME IN THE HEAD I SEE OKAY Andrew Jack HAVE REJECT PLUS ULTRA I CAN'T THIS I CAN'T I CAN'T DO THAT I GOT WE HAD 100 AND NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS ONLY 100 I LOVE THIS THOUGH THIS IS GOOD
[85:23.68]The two rats.
[85:24.40]How do they stay on your shoulder, man?
[85:25.94]How do you have to stay there?
[85:29.16]He said it.
[85:30.06]One of us.
[85:30.40]What do you mean, one of us?
[85:31.54]Because I said plus ultra?
[85:39.91]He said it again.
[85:40.43]I mean, I know what it is.
[85:41.33]It's when you're so strong and you go over the current power level threshold and then you can punch a guy real far.
[85:52.73]That's all it does.
[85:55.06]Doesn't do anything else.
[85:55.82]You can't go plus ultra to, like, cook bacon and shit.
[85:57.94]Like, that doesn't help.
[85:59.12]It's only to punch somebody very, very far.
[86:01.07]That's it.
[86:03.15]You want to rake your leaves at plus ultra?
[86:04.53]That's... It's not going to utilize that very well.
[86:09.35]Can't drive a car at plus ultra.
[86:12.44]That would be dangerous.
[86:14.90]Can't do anything at plus ultra besides punch somebody hard in the stomach until they fly.
[86:20.48]Not that useful.
[86:22.13]I'll take a brain over that.
[86:23.95]I'll take high IQ over that one.
[86:26.47]You know, the Riddler.
[86:36.78]Some things are just accurate.
[86:41.95]And it can't be rebuttaled or said otherwise.
[86:46.63]Except for this part up here.
[86:48.89]That part's inaccurate.
[86:49.71]That's not right.
[86:52.36]Here comes a boss fight in Terraria.
[86:59.63]Why do I have triangle hair?
[87:00.83]I think you should have asked, why do I have a triangle face?
[87:14.01]I think that's a better question.
[87:21.67]Are those tanning goggles?
[87:23.57]It's just me in a tanning boot.
[87:32.50]What is it?
[87:35.36]Deus Ex.
[87:36.32]Oh, Deus Ex.
[87:48.04]I've never played it.
[87:49.60]I know people are gonna freak the fuck out.
[87:52.42]Somebody just puked up their Captain Crunch when I just said that.
[87:56.78]And, like, it went up your nose and, like, into your sinuses, and it's on fire right now.
[88:01.43]And it's like, holy shit, that hurts so much.
[88:05.81]And, like, a little bit of milk starts to drizzle down, and you're like, oh, my God.
[88:09.97]And you think that you could, like, go into, like, putting more water in will help, but it makes it worse.
[88:14.25]You just have to take just a pain, like, a solid two minutes, and then you're fine.
[88:20.64]That's too specific.
[88:21.56]What are you talking about?
[88:23.60]You guys ever had milk go up your nose?
[88:25.93]That's in every, like, 90s movie.
[88:29.15]Like, the milk coming out somebody's nose.
[88:30.81]That's in every cartoon, TV show, media from 1991 to, like, 2004.
[88:34.63]You don't understand that.
[88:39.27]Reference?
[88:41.11]Too old?
[88:41.65]I'm not even too old.
[88:42.47]I'm not too old!
[88:44.83]You're too young!
[88:45.67]Don't get me screaming.
[88:48.99]Doctor's orders.
[88:53.45]This is called the egg.
[88:56.85]Why would you have this?
[89:00.41]Why would you do this?
[89:03.28]Why would you be the egg?

[89:07.72]This is just... You went to a convention and this is the only booth you got pins from.
[89:13.34]You didn't want to wait in line anywhere else.

[90:17.13]I will turn this on very quickly.
[90:19.50]In fact... Okay, I'll turn this on very quickly.
[90:26.66]Remember that.
[90:27.76]Now, now, now.
[90:28.48]I can't do it now.
[90:29.82]I'm delogged out.
[90:30.96]I can't.
[90:32.20]I can't do it right now.
[90:35.75]I lost my place again.
[90:43.49]Alright, here we go.
[90:44.75]We are at the halfway mark for art.
[90:48.30]Getting there.
[90:52.88]This is I'm Sorry Mama?
[90:55.54]Mama, I'm Sorry.
[91:05.49]uh did I do this what did I do oh it's cooking mama cooking mama right with the hand okay now I remember it's making the the dough balls why would you let me keep doing it you were smashing her hand I didn't mean to though

[91:40.97]Because you're epic.
[91:45.59]People love this.
[91:47.19]People can't get enough of this shit.
[91:50.01]People can't get enough of this.
[91:53.89]Like, guy handing you an item and pointing at you and talking to you and telling you to drink this coffee.
[91:59.25]Or just eat this food or drink this beverage.
[92:01.49]It's like everybody loves this shit.
[92:05.53]Dunkin Donuts ad.
[92:06.51]I like Dunkin Donuts.
[92:07.39]I drank Dunkin Donuts for fucking like 30 years.
[92:22.92]He hates it now.
[92:23.76]No, I like Dunkin Donuts.
[92:25.50]What's wrong with Dunkin Donuts?
[92:29.58]I don't like Dunkin' Donuts.
[92:31.06]I don't like Dunkin' Donuts.
[92:32.60]Yeah, I can buy, like, four coffees for the price of one from literally everywhere else.
[92:37.54]I don't like it.
[92:44.61]I got news for you.
[92:45.17]They all use the same damn beans.
[92:47.49]Wait, you think they have special fucking beans everywhere?
[92:49.69]What, are you crazy?
[92:51.31]No, they all buy, they're all, just like the, they all buy, they don't, no.
[92:54.99]No.
[92:56.18]Dunkin' Donuts' beans are everybody else's beans.
[92:59.70]They all get it from the same fucking distributor.
[93:02.42]And then they just grind it up and they add a little bit of vanilla powder into them, some of them.
[93:06.53]And like, oh, yeah, we have a blend.
[93:09.15]Oh, what's that?
[93:09.63]Let me just like... Oh, what's what we got here?
[93:12.35]Onion powder?
[93:13.09]Ah, put it in there.
[93:13.59]That's a nice fucking coffee blend.
[93:15.14]It's all the same shit.
[93:19.40]I know someone's gonna clip this and they're gonna make a whole video showing like where all these different companies get their beans from and it's gonna be completely inaccurate.
[93:25.40]And everything I'm saying is a fucking absolute farce, it's not even real at all.
[93:29.40]And then I'm gonna have to make it- an embarrassing follow-up to this where I go: yeah well fucking whatever um whatever like I like Dunkin Donuts I don't care, well shut up.
[93:39.40]And move on and we'll never talk about it again and I was wrong and you proved me wrong and um I just move on.
[93:48.18]Why do I feel like this?
[93:49.54]I feel like this on a daily basis sometimes.
[93:51.78]Just like, yeah.
[93:53.56]Happy fucking birthday.
[93:57.86]Here comes a bean apology stream.
[93:59.46]Imagine making like an apology video about you said that the coffee companies used the same beans everywhere.
[94:08.21]I feel like that's a thing that like a lawyer tells you to do.
[94:10.15]You know what I mean?
[94:11.07]Dude.
[94:16.38]Coffee Company and Co.
[94:18.20]was not happy about what you did.
[94:20.29]Go on TV and say that you were wrong and that all beans are fucking different.
[94:29.59]Okay, fine.
[94:30.45]Don't want to though.
[94:33.48]Do it.
[94:33.80]But you're gonna have to find a new lawyer.
[94:40.60]Do you want to lose $600,000, you fucking idiot?
[94:57.35]Jerry Seinfeld?
[95:04.11]Okay, I have to admit, I have to admit.
[95:09.61]I thought this was a big building, not a guy.
[95:11.86]I thought this was a huge Minecraft structure.
[95:16.60]But it's Minecraft, it's a guy, it's a skin.
[95:20.61]What really gave it away was the big hat up here.
[95:23.19]That I was like, why is there a hat on that building?
[95:28.15]This is cool though.
[95:31.82]Wait, it's both?
[95:37.08]Is it both?
[95:38.58]Look at the tiny guy.
[95:39.84]Yeah, but this is just like a zoomed in camera, right?
[95:48.47]Left is the skin, right is the replica.
[95:52.50]This is not somebody standing really close to the camera.
[95:57.26]It is a building.
[96:01.72]Oh, okay.
[96:02.83]Well, yeah, it looks cool.
[96:04.55]It is, idiot.
[96:05.31]It's a skin.
[96:05.91]That's what I've said.
[96:06.69]You guys are just filling me with hot air right now.
[96:10.09]That's the first thing that I said.
[96:21.75]Handsome streamer, huh?
[96:37.20]Change of music?
[96:38.22]Oh shit, alright.
[96:39.88]Here comes Alter Ego for the regular Nintendo.
[96:51.03]This is good.
[96:54.68]This is really good.
[96:58.13]Okay, um... Oh, that book that they made a movie on recently.
[97:03.67]It was a horror movie, and it was, uh... Uh... Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.
[97:10.79]Yeah, the... Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.
[97:16.75]Right?
[97:17.93]Not Lord of the Rings.
[97:18.65]Not Goosebumps.
[97:19.33]No, no.
[97:21.04]Yeah, this reminds me of the images that were in that book.
[97:27.65]This is like the killers and shit.
[97:29.91]Like the scary people that were in that book.
[97:36.27]I feel like this is page 16 or something.
[97:43.65]This one especially.
[97:46.37]Do I actually make these faces?
[97:49.14]Look at this one up here.
[97:50.70]Tell me this is not.
[97:52.36]This don't belong in scary stories.
[97:53.64]Tell in the dark.
[98:00.21]Am I a scary guy?
[98:02.09]I'm not scary, right?
[98:06.50]No, no, right?
[98:07.44]Because there's like a, you know... Are you perceived online as being a scary person?
[98:12.84]Or like, ah, he's just a comedian.
[98:14.04]Right?
[98:14.26]Right?

[99:50.69]That's the worst face 2020.
[99:53.01]Oh, yeah?
[99:54.37]You sure?
[99:54.71]How about now?
[100:06.66]Mistake.
[100:07.28]Follow those.
[100:09.34]You're going to regret that.
[100:15.50]I can't do better than that.
[100:16.32]Not at 65%.
[100:21.63]Why is my face always in shadow?
[100:25.75]Because I have recessed lighting.
[100:30.05]And it hits me right here.
[100:32.55]I've got a big-ass brow bone that shadows my face that gives me Batman eyes.
[100:37.80]I can't help that.
[100:39.06]That's how God created me.
[100:52.91]This is one.
[100:53.35]I like the shading of the Bia beard.
[100:55.31]Get lights in front of you.
[101:00.11]I hate that.
[101:01.79]No.
[101:02.69]No.
[101:04.44]I don't want to sit here at my computer and have like two studio lights blasting in my fucking face.
[101:12.16]No.
[101:12.42]I don't want.
[101:13.06]I'm not doing that.
[101:13.82]I'm not doing it.
[101:15.65]I like, if I go, if I'm doing a production or if I'm gonna be in the studio, sure.
[101:19.75]But I'm just uncomfortable in my own underwear.
[101:22.00]I don't want fucking, like, paparazzi lights, fish shooting in my eyes while I'm sitting here playing fucking cow games on PC.
[101:30.44]No.
[101:32.74]I'm comfortable in my own underwear.
[101:34.26]I'm not doing that.
[101:36.85]And I know, oh, they make like the soft lights.
[101:39.37]No, I'll look at it and then it'll burn me.
[101:41.65]It's all I'll see.
[101:46.95]How about this?
[101:47.59]When I upgrade to a GTX 2090, I'll get a Lite.
[101:55.33]That's never going to happen.
[101:56.55]1080, a Lite.
[102:01.85]Oh shit, this is the Garfield.
[102:04.67]This is computer cat.
[102:07.21]This is computer cat with two lighters.
[102:13.66]You guys think it's funny that I get so concerned about, like, copyright from, like, a cartoon character, but yet I will show on this stream full clips of Star Wars with me edited into them?
[102:31.09]Oh, hey, in about 25 minutes, we're gonna show, like, a full five minutes of a Star Wars movie.
[102:36.85]Uh, no, that's not Garfield.
[102:38.27]That's a computer cat.
[102:39.65]What the fuck am I talking about?
[102:47.66]Computer Cat for the win.
[102:48.89]This is actually... I like it.
[102:53.05]It's very good.
[102:53.67]I love the... I especially love the Obi-Wan Kenobi lightsaber and the Luke Skywalker lightsaber.
[102:59.19]Sorry, scratch that.
[103:00.39]You're wrong.
[103:00.81]That's Qui-Gon Jinn's lightsaber and Obi-Wan Kenobi's.
[103:04.21]I know my lore.
[103:12.80]What a Redditor.
[103:14.65]Oh, it doesn't... Alright.
[103:16.53]Okay.
[103:17.48]I had trouble deciphering if that was an image, an actual real image or not.
[103:26.38]It might be.
[103:32.83]I don't know.
[103:41.31]It's my mouth.
[103:43.33]We have very similar mouths and very similar noses.
[103:46.12]But he's got like, he's got like a full foot on me.
[103:54.28]Bastard.
[103:56.14]Dammit.
[103:58.62]Was he like 6'5"?
[103:59.02]Dammit.
[104:08.98]Don't let it get to you.
[104:12.37]What's with the Mega Milk?
[104:13.60]I don't, I don't even, I don't even know what this is.
[104:17.56]And it keeps popping up.
[104:18.64]He's 5'5", I'm 5'8".
[104:19.42]Fix that.
[104:21.64]There's like, there's 8300 people here right now.
[104:24.92]I'm gonna stop swearing.
[104:26.19]There's 8300 people right now.
[104:27.03]You're not gonna get, don't get lied to.
[104:28.57]Are you a new viewer?
[104:29.33]Have you just come from r slash all?
[104:31.45]Cause that's, uh, we've got new people from all.
[104:34.95]Hey, what's up?
[104:35.93]Uh, that's, don't listen to them.
[104:53.03]I don't- He's so cringey.
[104:57.11]If somebody was cringey, would they fucking be able to look like this?
[104:59.27]Would you be able to nod to music like this?
[105:11.90]If you were like, oh, look how cringey that dude is.
[105:13.64]No?
[105:13.92]Why, yeah?
[105:24.90]Talking to you.
[105:37.62]Hey, it's Glue Man.
[105:39.46]Wow.
[105:39.74]You go big guy.
[105:47.58]Shit.
[105:47.86]That's every scene the Joker does in Suicide Squad.
[105:52.32]God damn it.
[105:53.09]I'm... It's processing.
[105:57.29]Well, I... Fuck.
[106:03.57]Going off the grid.
[106:11.30]I love this.
[106:13.82]Bye.
[106:17.50]Crap.
[106:18.42]P-P-P-P-P-T-T.
[106:22.34]Oh, re- P P P P P R K. No.
[106:33.25]If the Joker was the Riddler.
[106:36.21]That probably happened.
[106:38.03]In some one of those universes.
[106:39.63]The Joker probably ate the Riddler and like absorbed his brain or something.
[106:42.31]I'm sure it has.
[106:42.83]There's been a lot of Jokers.
[106:55.72]Protoscoped Jerma.
[106:58.68]Guess I just spoke in third person.
[107:01.65]Don't leave.
[107:02.33]Please.
[107:07.77]Jerma worst face.
[107:08.73]Am I going to regret opening this?
[107:10.43]Am I going to regret doing this?
[107:15.27]But this is edited.
[107:17.07]You edited this.
[107:21.31]This has been edited.
[107:23.89]Unless, was there glass here that I pushed up against that I didn't see?
[107:27.01]Shit, lost my place.
[107:37.43]Lost my place.
[107:41.78]Oh shit, we're getting there.
[107:42.86]We're like at the last third here.
[107:46.88]This just took me off.
[107:47.74]I just got caught off guard on this one.
[107:55.73]Spoilers.
[107:56.73]What?
[107:57.57]Wait, is he naked?
[107:58.47]It's not edited.
[108:01.09]This is real.
[108:02.53]I... This is not edited.
[108:08.10]This one's not... I feel like it is.
[108:12.94]I feel like it is here.
[108:15.98]And here.
[108:21.85]Somebody says, did a cat sneeze?
[108:24.46]No, no, no, no, no.
[108:25.38]This is at gym class.
[108:28.26]Soccer ball was just kicked into my face.
[108:30.82]And somebody took a picture right when it hit.
[108:33.44]The frame after it bounced off my face.
[108:36.67]Just like a... And somebody snapped it right there.
[108:40.75]It came in from this direction.
[108:42.31]It right here.
[108:49.46]Oh, by the way, right there, black and white.
[108:52.59]One of the greatest PC games of all time.
[108:58.27]Some small movie details for you.
[109:04.09]How many more of these do you guys have?
[109:05.31]What the fuck is this one?
[109:11.23]I don't even... I don't... Coffee and Co.
[109:20.55]Why am I Homer Simpson?
[109:28.53]Okay, you're making me lose my place again.
[109:30.25]Oh, okay, here we are.
[109:35.55]Yeah!
[109:41.36]Finding of Isaac.
[109:43.30]And all the chat members.
[109:46.32]Ready to come after me.
[109:47.98]He didn't look at the pipes.
[109:52.40]Already forgot his own joke.
[109:58.18]What was with the pipe?
[110:02.52]It was the same beans.
[110:04.86]Oh!
[110:06.44]Right, right.
[110:07.92]Something about every company has beans.
[110:09.86]It was the same beans?
[110:13.13]Right, something about that.
[110:13.93]Something like that.
[110:17.96]I... I know... Look, I told you the reason why I can't talk about this.
[110:21.78]Because I didn't want to... I can't say... I can't... I can't say this out loud.
[110:26.90]I gotta be careful.
[110:28.69]There's 8,000 fucking people here.
[110:31.09]What if you work at coffee and company and you hear this?
[110:37.51]No, I can't... I cannot mess up my image.
[110:45.92]Oh, look, it's a rat.
[110:46.56]And that's me.
[110:49.19]What image?
[110:49.71]I don't know.
[110:53.83]Good one, hopefully.
[110:54.63]It's still scary!
[111:04.14]Even in tiny print!
[111:06.28]Even in, like, small doodle, I still have a scary face.
[111:14.66]Uh, this is great.
[111:15.36]Beautiful.
[111:18.47]Oh, look at that!
[111:19.11]I think this is a... A boss?
[111:25.40]Play?
[111:26.50]Pin?
[111:27.56]Creation?
[111:29.08]Magnet?
[111:29.86]I think this is a magnet.
[111:31.14]This is a really good magnet.
[111:37.10]No, this is nice, yeah.
[111:45.01]Okay, next OST.
[111:47.49]We only have time for probably one more OST before we go to the videos.
[111:52.55]It's a cookie?
[111:53.43]Oh, shit.
[111:54.07]No, that's not a cookie.
[112:01.20]FTL, you promised.
[112:02.68]Alright, fine.
[112:09.96]That's a really good soundtrack.
[112:10.84]Alter Ego for the NES.
[112:11.56]Alright, here's FTL.
[112:17.86]Pretty good.
[112:19.99]Okay, what's the next one?
[112:28.93]Alright, moving on.
[112:34.13]Dumb... Dumb Eternal.
[112:35.19]It's supposed to be Dumb Eternal.
[112:41.54]Or is it dome?
[112:43.82]Dome.
[112:44.24]Dome.
[112:46.40]Dome.
[112:49.59]Ah, funny.
[112:49.97]You're banned, idiot.
[112:54.19]Look.

[113:00.21]Why am I circling everything?
[113:01.31]Like, oh, that over here.
[113:02.74]That over here.
[113:08.66]Okay.
[113:11.02]Who did I ban?
[113:14.23]What?
[113:14.45]Oh, it's your mom.
[113:16.23]Right.
[113:16.61]Mom.
[113:20.13]Wait, is this in reference to that one time like a month or so ago when I was in the chat pretending to be you guys like parents for like 40 minutes?
[113:30.88]It was something weird.
[113:31.66]Yeah, it was something weird, right?
[113:36.00]Before the stream turned on, I was just sitting there for more than a half an hour.
[113:38.66]It was an acting out scenario where I called you guys on the phone and you guys were watching the house for the first time because you were a teenager or something like that.
[113:55.95]Is this supposed to be me?
[114:11.99]This looks like it could be playing somewhere in Times Square.
[114:16.29]This is one of those weird new age cool ads or something that's playing on one of the screens in Times Square.
[114:22.50]It's a Coke ad.
[114:28.60]Take me on.
[114:39.14]I don't even know the words, but I just know how it sounds.
[114:42.48]I'll be gone in a day or two.
[114:57.63]Something like that, right?
[115:06.95]The first part was pretty good.
[115:09.63]That was flat, was it?
[115:10.61]No, it wasn't.
[115:17.68]That one is.
[115:22.92]I needed one of those ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[115:25.12]No.
[115:44.57]Fixed it.
[115:46.93]Oh, wait, the echo is on.
[115:47.97]Whoops!
[115:50.21]My speakers!
[115:51.19]What happened to them?
[115:52.01]That wasn't that loud.
[115:57.38]Look at this dude.
[115:58.34]Real quick.
[116:00.40]It hurts, does it?
[116:02.92]It hurts?
[116:03.38]Shit, I'm sorry.
[116:06.31]I didn't mean to.
[116:10.35]Did you look at him?
[116:13.03]Hope you did.
[116:17.97]Is that one of those porn links?
[116:21.06]Every time I see a series of numbers and letters, it freaks me out because I think it's a porn link.
[116:26.92]Oh, that's Jex!
[116:30.00]Porn code.
[116:30.64]Remember?
[116:31.01]There was a porn code fiasco of 2018.
[116:34.85]Whatever the hell it was.
[116:35.51]Wait, is this a friend code?
[116:45.47]Oh, dude.
[116:47.49]Oh, I don't know if that would- I don't know if this was a good idea.
[116:51.15]You're gonna have to make, like, a- Oh.
[116:59.90]It's for the shirt.
[117:01.06]Okay, good.
[117:02.06]Because, like, if you just put- This is- If that was your friend code, you're gonna have to, like, buy a new Switch.
[117:09.54]You're gonna have to- You're gonna have to have, like, a new Nintendo account.
[117:16.84]It's the code for the shirt.
[117:17.96]Oh, and it's fucking... Stop swearing.
[117:20.46]You're not even cool.
[117:21.28]What do you think you're cool?
[117:22.95]I like the design of the Jack shirt.
[117:30.47]You're lame.
[117:34.89]Shut up.
[117:35.31]Stop.
[117:35.69]I'm trying.
[117:36.89]I'm trying.
[117:37.57]You said you were going to stop swearing like three years ago.
[117:40.31]It's a long process.
[117:42.60]I'm working on it.
[117:43.44]You know, I'll figure it out sooner or later.
[117:47.99]Pop that zit.
[117:48.71]Where?
[117:48.95]What do you see?
[117:50.11]A zit on his face.
[117:53.74]Excuse me.
[117:54.18]I want to ban that person, and then I want to take over their whole screen.
[117:58.40]Where is it?
[118:02.24]Where is it?
[118:05.54]I got a wicked red face, but that's all there is to it.
[118:09.82]My forehead.
[118:12.88]That's not a zit.
[118:14.48]That's a...
[118:18.13]mole.
[118:21.37]Guys, I got hit in the face six years ago, seven years ago.
[118:27.58]I have a permanent mark right there.
[118:30.68]I got hit in the face.
[118:34.00]Hey, hey.
[118:35.52]You should have seen the other guy.
[118:39.77]Am I cool yet?
[118:40.75]Do you like me?
[118:41.17]Where are you going?
[118:47.87]There it is.
[118:49.43]This is for jermaFireman.
[118:50.75]Let me get it real close so we can get a good scan on it.
[118:52.95]How does this shit work?
[119:08.94]QR codes are seriously some kind of alien technology.
[119:16.24]How can, like, a psychology inkblot transfer data?
[119:19.46]It's crazy to me.
[119:25.59]It's so bizarre.
[119:26.61]It's so cool.
[119:30.37]You're so old.
[119:31.05]No, but that's like... You don't think that's so interesting?
[119:35.07]A series of little blots on a piece of white paper.
[119:39.73]You can download Fireman through your telephone, like through your Switch.
[119:43.19]It's just like, oh yeah, hold your phone up.
[119:45.49]I know what that is.
[119:46.58]That's Fireman.
[119:48.06]How is this Fireman?
[119:51.22]This looks like somebody just peeled out in fucking the Wal-Mart parking lot.
[119:55.52]This is like tire marks.
[119:57.12]It's insane.
[119:58.55]It's impossible.
[120:04.71]barcoding is crazy barcodes it's I know it doesn't make any sense 3D leader he's pretending no that's cool barcodes and qr codes and scan like how does one qr code device differentiate between another qr code device like it's linked together it's all connected
[120:34.44]Okay.
[120:36.88]Uh, yeah, if you didn't watch, um, this is Weed Brain.
[120:40.50]No, this is called I'm Interested in How Communication Works Through Programming Means.

[121:32.79]That's too bad.
[121:33.49]Because I don't think that's a better game.
[121:36.15]Sorry.
[121:36.35]There we go.
[121:38.73]Is this... Is that big enough?
[121:43.03]Is this TV static big enough?

[123:47.50]Why is this here?
[123:49.70]Is my first question.
[123:51.62]And my second question is, it should be on the damn wall.
[123:55.40]Not on the ground outside.
[123:56.34]Why is it out here?
[124:03.72]What am I?

[124:29.38]It's Otto.
[124:32.02]Is this an Animal Crossing?
[124:38.17]Is this a character in Animal Crossing that's a dachshund?
[124:40.93]Or did they make this from scratch?
[124:42.83]Go back.
[124:44.41]No, I'll go back.
[124:49.55]It's made from scratch.
[124:54.18]This is really cute.
[124:56.34]Go back.
[124:56.80]I'm not going back.
[124:57.86]It's based off of a model.
[124:59.14]Oh, that's cool.

[125:58.27]Welcome to Saltcrest Island.
[126:00.27]Look at this dude.
[126:04.78]Good island.
[126:07.72]If I opened up Saltcrest, I'd probably get yelled at by somebody.
[126:12.96]It's probably overrun with bugs and weeds and... It's probably some...
[126:22.28]Not gonna be good.
[126:25.13]I know.
[126:25.85]I let it... Kim and I were playing it for a while while we were moving.
[126:29.41]My town went shit.
[126:34.90]This is really high quality though.
[126:35.86]Really good stuff.
[126:55.98]That's going to win.
[126:57.10]Probably.
[127:00.78]That was not even a bad.
[127:02.26]This is not a worst face.
[127:05.40]I would say this is a slightly creepy face.
[127:09.74]But not the worst face.
[127:13.52]Think about when you hear the word worst.
[127:18.84]This doesn't come to mind.
[127:21.50]Just because I'm holding this up.
[127:24.97]Why so serious?
[127:26.83]That's not what this says.
[127:27.65]That's his worst face.
[127:28.63]Okay?
[127:29.43]That's not the Joker card with a bite taken out of it, like in the movies.
[127:32.69]No.
[127:33.87]That's a category for a show that I did.
[127:41.59]Oh, look at this.
[127:44.69]You know what I want to talk about detail?
[127:48.37]Let's talk detail.
[127:51.53]Otto actually has this.
[127:53.42]It's his winter coat.
[127:57.00]That's some detail work there.
[128:00.34]He goes outside when it's too cold out.
[128:02.52]And he puts on his little jacket and... Because he gets cold.
[128:06.40]He's a little dog.
[128:10.59]Fireman also has... This is cool.
[128:12.71]Fireman has the watering can.
[128:14.59]That's just detailed right there.
[128:18.79]And then... A guy going to a football game.
[128:25.41]Okay, well if you painted this all of you and you went to like an NFL game Like who are you rooting for?
[128:35.15]Nobody Me I'm number one I'm rooting for the clowns I wish
[128:51.59]I need a hundred million dollars.
[128:53.43]Not even.
[128:53.69]It wouldn't even take that much.
[128:55.09]I want to do like a... It's like a sports thing where it's like the clowns.
[129:00.55]Like versus the dinosaurs.
[129:01.65]You know what I mean?
[129:02.07]It's like a baseball game.
[129:02.84]And it's just... It's just a baseball game.
[129:06.72]And they just play baseball.
[129:10.86]And like the clowns take like rabbits out of hats and shit and like... Like before pitches and the dinosaurs like roar and hit home runs.
[129:19.25]But it's just a regular game of baseball.
[129:25.50]There's nothing there that's... Wow, that's really interesting.
[129:28.47]No, no, they just play baseball.
[129:29.51]I, like, want to watch it.
[129:33.47]One day.
[129:33.69]Yeah, like, yeah, it would be like the Cincinnati Clowns versus, like, the Delaware Dinosaurs.
[129:45.34]There'd be people in costumes and... Sounds like fun.
[129:51.26]We got more.
[129:54.90]Like, he's not already a millionaire.
[129:56.22]Okay, let me just ask you this.
[130:01.29]How much do you think it costs to rent out a Major League Baseball stadium for a day?
[130:10.23]How much do you think that is?
[130:12.01]How much do you think that costs?
[130:15.84]That's a whole net worth gone in two minutes.
[130:20.49]It's like 100k.
[130:22.07]It's probably like a million.
[130:23.51]It's probably like 50 to 100k.
[130:30.75]Minor league.
[130:31.39]Maybe 20, 30k.
[130:32.80]Maybe.
[130:37.24]But then you gotta hire nine clowns and nine dinosaurs.
[130:42.44]And they have to be competent in baseball.
[130:44.72]I have to hire players that play.
[130:49.22]Well, I can't just... What, am I not gonna hire, like, 30 people to play?
[130:53.14]And the clowns have to have, like, powers.
[130:55.99]You know, they gotta have, like, special powers.
[130:58.19]I want... Essentially, I want to make Mario Baseball a reality.
[131:01.51]Where, like, the clown, like, winds up, and, like, two other clowns run behind him, and they both throw, like, goofy comedy balls, but the one real ball comes out of the middle.
[131:09.54]That's his power.
[131:14.98]It'll happen.
[131:16.16]Wait till I'm at 100.
[131:17.80]Lazy Purple came in with a raid.
[131:19.32]Welcome everybody from Lazy Purple's channel.

[134:26.65]Put a notch on the chalkboard for scary image of Jeremy's face.
[134:30.01]He's a terrifying serial killer and he's going to kill you.
[134:33.27]There's a newspaper article about this is the guy's face that we saw and he's on the loose.
[134:37.67]He's a murderer apparently.

[135:00.30]On his favorite pillow.
[135:01.96]That's exactly what he does.
[135:04.58]He just barely fits on it.
[135:06.46]And he sleeps.
[135:08.96]He loves Wailord.
[135:10.90]I love this.
[135:18.43]Am I doing the music before the video section?
[135:20.39]There actually is only one song.

[136:04.70]I love tanks.
[136:07.16]It's like my favorite thing in the world.
[136:09.24]It's so easy.
[136:12.31]it's so simple. I love just tank top and shorts and flip-flops.
[136:16.31]If I could wear it every day I would.
[136:17.31]And the best part- that's one of the reasons moving out here to Vegas.
[136:21.31]Six to seven months of the year it's like 80 to 115 degrees.
[136:25.31]I just can just wear the flip-flops and the tank top and the shorts every day every day and it makes me so happy.
[136:33.31]I don't have to do anything. It's just- like oh- it's just like- it's like putting like a tablecloth on you it's just like: Oh is it on? I guess? Let's go! Time to go out!
[136:42.85]That's a boomer.
[136:43.51]No, it's not. No, it's not.
[136:45.00]Excuse me, please.
[136:46.88]That's not a boomer thing.
[136:49.90]That's a I-like-to-relax thing.
[136:54.28]No, a tank top.
[136:57.75]Tank top and, like, a nice pair of shorts.
[137:03.27]Whatever.
[137:03.51]It's comfortable.
[137:04.51]Since when did comfort become... Oh, that's stupid.
[137:06.56]Don't do that.
[137:17.29]I do that all the time.
[137:31.04]This is great.
[137:32.76]That's pretty good.
[137:33.42]It is pretty good.
[137:34.14]Yeah.
[137:34.58]I'm fucked up in this one.
[137:38.79]The hair is accurate too.
[137:39.85]That's the best part.
[137:40.49]Not anymore though.
[137:41.73]Quarantine cut.
[137:47.35]What's going on in the corner down here?
[137:55.09]I thought this one was just moving.
[137:59.31]It is moving.
[138:01.35]Is it moving?
[138:15.51]Worst picture on the internet.
[138:18.52]I appreciate how much detail and how much time went into this, but it's the worst picture on the internet.
[138:22.88]The thing that it is... The source.
[138:27.59]The source is the worst picture on the internet.
[138:30.57]Not the depiction.
[138:33.19]Excuse me.
[138:37.51]He hates it.
[138:37.97]No, I hate that picture.
[138:39.71]I hate this photo.
[138:42.57]Not the painting depicting the photo.
[138:46.22]The photo.
[138:47.74]The photo of me that this is based on.
[138:51.32]Very well made, though.
[138:56.91]Everybody loves Pac-Man.
[138:58.73]My favorite character ever, and I've played one game on stream.
[139:02.37]I made a video about Pac-Man, like, seven years ago, and I played one of his games.
[139:06.27]Oh, that's my favorite thing in the world.
[139:07.51]Don't you guys know that?
[139:10.16]I gotta play Pac-Man on stream.
[139:12.08]For real.
[139:27.62]That point still stands.
[139:29.46]Even though it's Shido.
[139:37.85]You haven't seen Shido in a long time either, have you?
[139:39.55]Shido will be back.
[139:42.88]I thought it was Pac-Man.
[139:45.00]It's because my brain was only focusing down here.
[139:48.22]Like, this was my eyeline, and I didn't even look up at all.
[139:51.68]It was about 20 straight seconds.
[139:56.26]It's on your Reddit shelf.
[139:57.20]Yeah, but I mean, you haven't heard him sing in a while.
[140:00.04]He's out of batteries.
[140:02.15]Burma985.
[140:02.57]Rattail.
[140:02.93]Lion ears.
[140:03.33]Both nose and fluff.
[140:04.01]And then good- Wait, there's like three different animals.
[140:28.68]Rat tail, lion ears, and wolf nose.
[140:31.34]That's three animals.
[140:35.18]But is that one of... Do I... Do you supposed to combine like four animals?
[140:39.34]You're gonna lose viewers now.
[140:45.98]A hybrid animal.
[140:52.71]Um...
[140:54.29]I'm not drawing all the scales, they say, for Aquaman's shirt.
[140:59.06]Evolution.
[141:01.38]There are no rules.
[141:07.80]I don't know why I'm trying to follow any.
[141:09.88]I'm trying to follow some rules that aren't here, that aren't real.
[141:19.49]This is AI-generated faces or something, based on that image.
[141:26.68]which one looks like actually could be the most realistic one from like a thousand years ago uh I got my money's on this one this one looks like it could be real this just looks like a really bad senior photo like too much soft touching and by the way I gotta bring this up um
[141:51.28]It's an extra, like, $10 to $20 for them to soft touch your senior pictures when it's just a filter that they click one button on.
[141:58.63]Why?
[141:58.85]I don't understand.
[142:02.45]I never got that.
[142:03.09]That never made sense to me.
[142:06.12]Oh, you can get regular senior photos.
[142:07.82]Oh, you get the senior photos with a soft touch.
[142:09.96]It just makes your face glow and they just blur your face a little.
[142:17.91]I want a photo that looks like me.
[142:21.14]I want to... Bottom right?
[142:22.52]No.
[142:24.00]Bottom left or top right?
[142:25.16]True neutral.
[142:30.42]Chaotic evil, right?
[142:33.48]Chaotic neutral.
[142:36.14]Chaotic good.
[142:38.98]Lawful good.
[142:41.14]Lawful neutral.
[142:43.24]Lawful evil.
[142:45.95]Pretty close.
[142:47.75]Neutral good.
[142:49.25]Neutral...
[142:53.76]what is down here neutral neutral neutral no chaotic wait wait waffle good waffle neutral waffle evil neutral good neutral neutral neutral evil evil neutral okay that makes sense this whole thing works true neutrals in the middle

[144:48.57]I can't.
[144:49.39]Was that Death Stranding?
[144:54.36]Was that the E3 trailer of Death Stranding from like three and a half years ago?
[145:10.27]Alright, come on, this streamer is determined.

[147:33.86]Alright.
[147:36.16]This better not be a blaster.
[147:38.81]If this is a blaster, I'm turning it off immediately.
[147:42.40]Alright, at least you gave a warning.
[147:46.54]Okay?
[147:46.86]This might be a blaster and a flasher.
[147:51.35]Just be aware.
[147:51.87]It might be loud.
[147:53.99]You don't put a warning here unless this is fucked up.

[153:07.94]Why did you blur out Joker's face?
[153:16.96]Is that to help with- with copyright or something?
[153:20.94]Like, are you blurring out his- like, mosaicing his face?

[154:46.14]Dunkin' Donuts has nothing to do with this.
[154:48.38]I have nothing to do with Dunkin' Donuts.
[154:49.94]That was a parody comedy routine.

[155:51.03]There's no one out here.
[155:52.22]I don't know if there's a Bigfoot up there or if it's a person.
[155:56.62]That ain't right.

[156:25.25]This is the freakiest, creepiest thing I've ever seen.
[156:27.33]What the hell did we step into?
[156:32.89]We seen those hanging in those trees.
[156:35.21]It looked like witchcraft to me, and I wish to God I had a bag of salt in my hand to put a circle around us, because I was just that scared.
[156:42.97]You alright?
[156:43.35]It was just that circle around us, because I was just that scared.
[156:47.79]It looked like witchcraft to me, and I wish to God I had a bag of salt in my hand to put a circle around us, because I was just that scared.

[156:58.18]Hey, none of us alright.
[157:00.91]I can't explain what we found tonight.
[157:03.00]We hear something that sounds like singing.
[157:05.10]Then we hear a Bigfoot roar.
[157:07.66]And then we walk up and we find these things that are up in a tree that I can't even explain other than they look evil.
[157:15.06]Really, really bad feeling.

[179:07.89]America, go out and live your lives.
[179:11.29]Don't worry about the weather.
[179:12.81]You just go outside and sniff.
[179:14.76]You'll be just fine.
[179:16.50]It's going to be cold some days.
[179:17.88]It's going to be hot some days.

[179:22.04]Go out there and live.
[179:27.81]Stop.
[179:28.15]Don't go.

[180:28.61]That was insane.
[180:33.63]That was insane.
[180:35.87]Here comes an enemy spider video.
[180:38.87]Always have to have at least a few of these because they're gnomed.
[180:43.22]They are the best.

[180:49.89]Here it comes.
[180:51.41]True art.

[180:54.13]You want me to link that one?
[180:55.01]Sorry.
[180:57.07]I was doing the thing where you're talking, but you're doing something else entirely.
[181:02.32]I'm guilty of doing this on the phone all the time.
[181:05.90]and you're just saying words to make sure the other person just doesn't think you're insane and losing your mind, that you're just silent.
[181:11.84]So you just say words while you do something else entirely and hope that you're sounding not like a fucking moron while you talk.
[181:19.93]And then they pick up on it.
[181:20.77]They're like, what does it have to do with this?
[181:23.49]And then you desperately, desperately try to make the weird thing that makes no sense make sense for the current conversation.
[181:31.61]Because you know you fucked up and you said something outrageous that you shouldn't have said.
[181:38.59]Anyways, Mega Man.
[181:41.41]See, a lot of people didn't know that there was a boss battle in this.
[181:46.73]The giant enemy spider.

[181:55.85]There actually is a spider boss in Mega Man?
[182:00.29]Spider.

[182:12.62]I have to be honest with you.
[182:14.46]I watched this one.
[182:16.46]I watched this one already.
[182:20.13]And I don't understand it.
[182:26.37]The person that made this video, yeah, I know the title.
[182:29.15]The person who created this video is probably pretty upset that they made a Carmel Leldown dancing video when I did it last weekend.
[182:36.60]This video was made probably a month or two ago.
[182:46.86]This video's got flashes in it.
[182:48.46]I didn't even realize that until right now.
[182:51.34]Why am I... Okay, that's the whole video.

[192:56.65]That's not supposed to be going that fast.
[193:05.10]And why is it a green screen?
[193:06.18]What, you couldn't put, like, a restaurant back here or, like, a kitchen?
[193:08.86]I would be, yeah, I'd be afraid of the radiation coming off of this thing.
[193:21.56]Ungrateful streamer.
[193:24.54]Where are we?
[193:25.48]You gotta put... I gotta be in plant... I need my immersion.
[193:36.73]Yes.
[193:36.99]Probably a meme or something.
[193:42.17]I don't know what it is.
[193:56.33]This is... I think this is just a clip of one of my videos.
[194:01.49]I think this is just a clip from a video.
[194:07.29]This is not... I don't think this is a video.
[194:12.74]I'm interested in the history of this place.
[194:14.59]Let us go back hundreds of years.
[194:18.79]It is the year 1775.
[194:22.95]Or seven years.
[194:26.82]This is just a video.
[194:29.70]This is just a video.
[194:31.50]This is just a clip from one of my V- I gotta follow the rules, man!
[194:42.40]This is the best part.
[194:56.48]Okay.
[194:59.56]Crow time.
[195:01.06]No, Kit Fisto.
[195:02.28]No.
[195:02.56]Alright, we only have a couple more.
[195:06.27]Jerma's Soggy Feet.
[195:09.27]I know people hate when I say this, but this is spoilers for the entire Avengers saga, Infinity War, Endgame, spoilers for all that shit.
[195:18.26]I know I have to say it because who the fuck knows?
[195:20.06]There's 9,000 people here.
[195:21.69]I'm sorry, I have to say it every single time.
[195:24.57]This is for Infinity War, spoiler, right here, right now.
[195:52.63]You should have gone for the head.
[195:58.28]This movie sucks.
[196:12.90]Hold on, hold on.
[196:13.81]I need to... I need to... I'm gonna break this one down in my head a little bit here.
[196:19.03]One more.
[196:41.85]Somebody said it's reversed It's reversed why I
[197:10.96]That's so funny.
[197:16.23]I'm so happy.
[197:18.71]This is a source filmmaker of when I did the toilet.
[197:22.23]Look at how funny I am.
[197:24.92]April Fool's video.
[197:27.86]Here it comes.
[197:29.48]Hey, April Fool's.
[197:33.36]It's a toilet, you know what I mean?
[197:45.05]Oh, I don't get it.
[197:45.95]What's that mean?
[197:47.21]I filmed an April Fool's video where I videotaped myself flushing a toilet and it was like, look at how funny my April Fool's Twitter video is.
[197:53.40]And I actually really dropped the phone into the toilet.
[197:57.08]Not on purpose.
[198:04.63]We have one more.
[198:05.49]No, we don't.
[198:06.15]Well, I do.
[198:13.15]The shame in his voice.
[198:16.17]Wait, what is this?
[198:18.09]Why are you guys linking me a video?
[198:21.42]Hey.
[198:23.48]April fools.
[198:24.72]Oh, this is just the video.
[198:26.14]Okay.
[198:29.12]Oh my goodness.
[198:30.66]Dude, grow time.
[198:32.06]I told grow time.

[198:43.32]Oh!
[198:44.28]Why did I click that?
[198:45.04]Does anybody have that?
[198:46.58]Where is it?
[198:49.28]Where's the actual video?
[198:50.48]I'll show it.
[198:56.39]Alright, next one.
[199:01.05]I'm just clicking random links in the chat right now.
[199:10.33]Where is it?
[199:12.51]Okay, let me just make this very clear.
[199:15.19]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[199:20.08]Hold on.
[199:21.86]Important.
[199:23.66]Okay, let me just make this very clear.
[199:26.28]Getting these games to run is like ripping my penis off with the other end of a hammer.
[199:31.88]I'm practically insane.
[199:35.42]You get us going, player one.
[199:45.21]In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you're under arrest, Chancellor.
[199:50.53]The Senate will decide your fate.
[199:52.91]I am the Senate.
[199:54.88]Not yet.
[199:55.50]I have to see it again.
[200:01.36]So it's BB-8 unit then.
[200:41.67]Alright, no more.
[200:49.38]No more, that's it.
[200:50.34]I'm not gonna watch it all.
[200:57.88]Alright, okay.
[201:00.10]That was very funny.
[201:02.68]Alright.
[201:06.96]Toilet video.
[201:08.01]It's the toilet video.
[201:12.79]This is the real Link.
[201:15.01]Oh, is it now?
[201:20.57]Watch it again.
[201:23.07]Alright, everyone, get your places.
[201:25.59]Alright?
[201:26.61]Today is the big day today, alright?
[201:28.97]Just- Stop giving me videos that we're not watching yet.
[201:31.57]We're not watching- This is uploaded today.
[201:34.70]Give me the real link.
[201:48.22]Alright, who's next for a flu shot?
[201:49.80]Oh, that's me.
[201:50.38]I'm, uh, I'm Peter Griffin.
[201:51.76]Mr. Griffin, these flu shots are in short supply.
[201:55.49]What the f- What is this?
[201:56.45]Does- Give me- I'm just gonna type it in the Google right now.
[202:07.42]Jerma April Fool's video.
[202:10.50]Guys, come on.
[202:10.86]You're supposed to be helping me out here.
[202:15.56]There we go.
[202:16.50]All I had to do was do it myself.
[202:24.20]Alright, what we're gonna do is we're gonna play- Ah, it's fucking spoilers.
[202:27.32]Spoilers.
[202:28.98]You can see the last two videos.
[202:34.39]That's me with short hair.
[202:41.47]Huge spider.
[202:45.35]Go back.
[202:46.09]Just wait!
[202:52.98]Hey.
[202:54.01]April fools.
[202:56.79]It's a toilet, you know what I mean?
[203:00.38]I totally got you.
[203:06.16]Okay, so I'll break this one down.
[203:07.48]Let me break this down.
[203:09.12]So this is... April fools.
[203:11.18]Let's mute it.
[203:11.66]So this is like, look at me, I'm flushing the toilet.
[203:14.14]It's so funny, oh my god, April Fools, it's a toilet, you know what I mean?
[203:17.96]Try to pretend to hit my face on the door.
[203:20.50]That was the joke part.
[203:22.28]Like, oh, look, I'm gonna leave now.
[203:24.00]Oh, the door hit me in the face.
[203:26.67]And then I dropped the phone, actually, into the toilet.
[203:33.83]Not good.
[203:37.25]Not good.
[203:38.93]Not good.
[203:43.11]Bits within bits.
[203:47.21]Play them side by side.
[203:53.20]That's what I'm doing.
[203:56.40]The idea.
[204:07.31]But this is going to conclude the community content night.
[204:12.35]We're going to watch a little bit of this Sonic thing.
[204:17.21]And those of you, before you leave, let's hold on.
[204:19.71]There's a lot of people here that need to hear this that may not have been here at the beginning of the stream.
[204:23.45]Let's go close to this one.
[204:25.92]I am not going to be around for a pretty long time.
[204:31.76]Those of you that didn't see the beginning of the stream or didn't see the stream, I am about to go on a medical leave of absence.
[204:40.99]If you want to know why, it's about the first 20 minutes of the video.
[204:45.55]I'm... It became really clear.
[204:48.69]TL;DR if you don't want to go back and watch any of that shit.
[204:52.26]It became very clear over the last, like, four or five days after the green screen stuff that I have to get this figured out.
[204:57.78]And I have to, whether it's do some kind of procedure where I get an injection into a nerve, or... I'm going back and forth with my doctor about some things that we want to try.
[205:09.39]So the next couple of weeks, I'm just going to be hammering trying to figure out what the fuck's wrong with me.
[205:18.09]And I hate to take more time, but...
[205:21.18]I have to rip the band-aid off and I can't just like stream with a chest brace on you know what I mean like that's no I gotta get this figured out so if you want to get more info and more you know exactly what I'm talking about the first 25 minutes or so of this stream we talked about it extensively I'm gonna be back at 100 I'm gonna back at 100 percent I'm gonna figure it out and do whatever it takes
[205:52.52]But that's going to conclude essentially this stream.
[205:54.40]We're going to do a couple more things.
[205:56.84]Let me just open this.
[205:58.60]I want them side by side.
[206:00.14]Let's play them both at the same time.
[206:04.38]Can I even... Can I even do that?
[206:12.77]Hey.
[206:14.85]Hey.
[206:15.21]Hey.
[206:17.43]Can I... Hold on.
[206:18.27]I have to recapture this.
[206:20.73]Where did this go?
[206:30.66]unknown.png unknown.png what is this I wait look I've look if I've got hair on my head I've got hair if one Google search can show I've got hair on my head
[207:01.28]This is not this.
[207:03.66]This is the same person in the screen.
[207:09.59]Look, this is my real hair.
[207:12.49]I can even go swimming with it.
[207:14.31]Not too hard.
[207:20.52]Alright.
[207:22.96]Let me put this over here.
[207:27.86]Okay, now the toilet video.
[207:31.00]This over here.
[207:33.06]Okay.
[207:35.80]That's that video.
[207:37.96]Okay.
[207:43.98]Will this show up or what the hell is it doing?
[207:50.44]This is wrong.
[207:52.50]Oh, there we go.
[207:57.08]We can't see.
[207:58.02]I know you can't see.
[207:59.04]I know you can't see.
[208:06.25]oh we did I didn't play huge spider yet the giant enemy spider
[208:22.09]That was awesome.
[208:23.28]That was actually really good.
[208:25.02]I can't link to it because it's on my computer.
[208:27.54]It's in the Discord.
[208:28.12]By the way, for those of you that want to make sure people see your music and see your shit, it's got to be on a site like YouTube or like a SoundCloud or like a place I can link to, not just a downloadable link.
[208:42.20]We can't see.
[208:42.78]We can't see.
[208:43.32]We can't see.
[208:43.82]I can't see.
[208:44.40]I can't see it.
[208:46.83]I know.
[208:48.55]Trying to get this to capture two images.
[208:54.38]There was fake hair.
[208:57.24]Um, what the fuck?
[208:59.66]Okay, I gotta, I gotta focus.
[209:01.64]Here we go.
[209:01.88]Let's open these both at the same time.
[209:05.04]Let's see how accurate they are.
[209:06.08]Okay.
[209:15.99]Let's turn this one on first.
[209:24.50]Oh, you're driving me mad!
[209:32.91]You're driving me mad.
[209:33.97]Why won't this capture it?
[209:45.72]I'm annoyed.
[209:46.08]Computers just don't work.
[209:54.96]Yeah, computers don't work.
[209:57.12]I don't understand.
[209:58.88]I can't capture them.
[209:59.42]Why can I not capture my desktop?
[210:00.44]I don't understand.
[210:03.55]This is a long blink.
[210:04.85]I'm sorry.
[210:07.97]Dad, why the fuck are you crying so damn loud?
[210:10.09]Okay, was this a meme before?
[210:17.13]But see, my computer sucks.
[210:19.07]Was this a meme beforehand?
[210:20.34]Or is this something that dude just... It was funny, and they just did it.
[210:33.68]It's an ancient meme.
[210:36.56]Is it?
[210:37.88]Well, it's funny.
[210:39.62]I've never seen it, so it's funny.
[210:40.72]Alright.
[210:44.02]Before we go, I do want to watch a couple clips of the Sonic animated remastered thing.
[210:52.42]You don't know what I'm talking about.
[210:53.96]Somebody in the community had a lot to do with this project.
[211:00.62]Was it called Sonic Unleashed?
[211:03.48]Miss the spider?
[211:04.08]No, the spider was the song.
[211:09.54]I just had it on my tab.
[211:14.14]What's it called?
[211:14.60]Sonic Remastered?
[211:15.38]Sonic Reloaded?
[211:18.94]And I did promise, like, for the last year that I was gonna watch some clips from this.
[211:24.14]Even if we only watch a few.
[211:30.92]Where the fuck is it?
[211:32.92]Oh, how am I like this?
[211:39.35]Here it is.
[211:40.95]That's not it.
[211:41.75]That's not it.
[211:42.23]I don't even know what that is.
[211:42.85]I'm not going to open that.
[211:45.05]I just had it.
[211:45.67]I just closed the tab.
[211:48.43]Stop doing bonk sound effects.
[211:50.53]I've tried to type it in.
[211:51.51]Oh, my God.
[211:57.45]I can't find it.
[211:58.49]I'm going to go to the Discord.
[211:59.23]I have to go to the Discord to find it.
[212:02.51]You guys, seriously.
[212:03.67]He's going to... Hey, guys, just put anything.
[212:06.55]He's going to click on all of them.
[212:08.61]He's going to click every single one.
[212:11.25]So just put anything there.
[212:12.49]He'll click it.
[212:13.35]Holy shit, it got on stream.
[212:17.76]Paper Mario OST.
[212:19.04]I love... No.
[212:24.14]It's the Shmi Nest.
[212:25.12]Nope.
[212:31.75]I'm about to fucking get out of here.
[212:36.77]Play Benny Hill and get- Bonk!
[212:51.23]Can one of the mods give it to me?
[212:52.89]One of the mods do it, please.
[212:54.31]I want a mod to send me the link to this.
[212:58.36]I just typed it in.
[212:59.16]I can't find it.
[213:09.12]Why do you keep giving me the same video?
[213:16.15]Do I have any mods?
[213:17.23]Do I have any mods?
[213:20.01]I need the Sonic Reloaded Animated Collaboration video.
[213:27.19]No mods.
[213:28.70]There are.
[213:29.20]They just don't know what I'm talking about because I'm a fucking psycho.
[213:35.47]Where is it?
[213:39.09]I don't- This is like inside of a toilet or something.
[213:40.73]I'm not- Here.
[213:42.09]That was the same one!
[213:54.50]That was- Stop!
[213:56.42]You're gonna hurt me.
[213:57.96]You're hurting me.
[214:01.07]This dream has been ruined.
[214:08.38]Okay.
[214:10.90]Okay.
[214:12.78]Wow.
[214:13.86]Would you look at this?
[214:14.78]Looks like it's Sonic the Hedgehog coming at you.
[214:21.16]Holy shit.
[214:27.87]This is an hour.
[214:28.49]We're not going to watch an hour.
[214:29.63]I plan on going skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.
[214:33.57]That's what we're going to get.
[214:35.63]That's what we're going to do.
[214:46.77]Five Nights at Freddy's?
[214:47.73]Is this the right video?
[214:57.60]Okay.
[214:58.86]It's like 200 people made this.
[215:27.06]First things first, one, skip!
[215:30.91]Wait, grab the next step!
[215:48.92]So, let me get started.
[215:49.90]So, 200 different people.
[215:52.75]made all of it or just like pieces of it so what did each person make a like an image or like a finally the only thing left to be done is to capture the essential pieces of it from your counterpart everyone contributed every 0.5 seconds my hyper metal Sonic when you awaken kill him wait that's actually like a marionette
[216:35.42]It's a remake of the movie?
[216:36.76]I don't think that's true.
[216:37.46]Each person made one thing.
[216:47.27]Wait, this is a remake of the original?
[216:50.13]I don't know anything about Sonic the Hedgehog.
[216:51.65]All I know is I made that in Dreams.
[216:53.35]Like a year ago.
[216:59.33]That was exactly my inspiration.
[217:04.61]I had nothing to do with this, though.
[217:09.43]Very pretty.
[217:11.33]The 90s Sonic OVA.
[217:13.81]Oh.
[217:15.29]Sonic!
[217:16.37]I finally finished it!
[217:17.87]See, isn't it great?
[217:19.53]It's a jet-propelled bodyboard.
[217:22.00]Come on, you wanna try it out?
[217:23.64]Oh, I get it.
[217:24.96]I see what's happening.
[217:25.78]Alright, I'll go use it myself.
[217:27.28]Oh, should I do it?
[217:27.90]This is crazy.
[217:28.36]Tails is just like a little kid with his new toy.
[217:42.73]So this is the whole movie.
[217:53.18]I feel like I'm watching an episode of Gumball.
[217:59.53]This is crazy.
[218:04.56]That's the best.
[218:05.66]This is my favorite one.
[218:06.42]That's the best one.
[218:07.14]That was perfect.
[218:07.66]I did the same thing with the Shrek movie.
[218:39.95]Sod it.
[218:41.97]Are you alright, Sod it?
[218:44.27]I'm fine, just fine.
[218:45.85]So, who's that?
[218:46.89]Hi, Sod it.
[218:49.11]I have some news for you.
[218:51.83]I guess so.
[218:53.74]Gee, I hope the President and Sarah are doing alright.
[218:56.48]Damn.
[219:10.16]No, no, no, no.
[219:10.50]It's not fair.
[219:10.83]You always beat me every time.
[219:12.45]Alright, one more.
[219:14.25]Just give up.
[219:14.89]We've played a hundred times.
[219:16.49]I'll stop being your hostage.
[219:18.29]Alright, start it again.
[219:19.55]This is the... What the fuck?
[219:22.95]Good animation.
[219:23.54]What the fuck?
[219:23.96]Good animation.
[219:24.78]Yeah, there's 200 people that worked on this.
[219:37.21]You should do this.
[219:43.37]How?
[219:45.99]What, I turn a stream on and every three seconds it's another artist's depiction of the stream?
[219:51.07]Actually, it would be kind of funny.
[219:59.02]That'd be pretty funny, I think.
[220:00.16]It's just that's the screen for like two hours.
[220:02.34]How does this movie end?
[220:09.11]Did I even show the ending?
[220:10.77]Rat movie rebuilt.
[220:25.19]Every 10 minutes have a different streamer be you.
[220:28.49]That's so funny.
[220:31.95]This is pretty sick.
[220:34.30]Skip it!
[220:41.32]I told you guys.
[220:41.98]This is like live action.
[220:44.17]Sonic better enjoy his victory now, because once he gets to Robotropolis, he'll have to fight something far more evil than Metal Robotnik!
[220:54.09]What do you mean worse than Metal Robotnik?
[220:56.15]Are you talking about yourself?
[220:57.67]You better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you!
[221:00.51]This is where the metal guy...
[221:08.51]Oh, but what I was saying was, I had an idea a long time ago, where I was gonna pay somebody that looked like me.
[221:16.27]That was essentially a doppelganger stream for like two weeks straight.
[221:23.63]And don't ever bring it up, don't ever mention it.
[221:25.89]And I kind of come in sometimes and I sit in behind them in a chair for some streams, and just teachers aid them, you know, like put notes down and be like, No, no, no, no, no, sorry, it was look at me, you gotta go, you gotta do it, right.
[221:40.33]Like, I'm training the next Jerma to take over.
[221:47.98]And they study the way that I talk and everything that I do.
[221:52.40]And they just try so hard to just be me.
[221:56.16]For a week or two.
[221:57.26]Straight.
[222:00.73]Jerma Apprentice.
[222:01.55]You have, like, more than one.
[222:02.63]You have, like, five people.
[222:03.99]And then, like, you get fired.
[222:07.85]Like, they get voted off.
[222:13.59]I mean, I thought it would be kind of funny to do that, at least.
[222:18.81]Um, but then I just kind of gave up on it.
[222:22.47]It's a reality show.
[222:24.13]Yeah, I mean, sure.
[222:25.51]It's on the list of things.
[222:28.58]Streamer school.
[222:30.98]But it's not like I'm teaching you how to be a streamer.
[222:32.54]I'm teaching you, I want you to be me.
[222:38.02]I'll explore it a little bit.
[222:41.62]Huh?
[222:46.19]This is fucking insane.
[222:48.39]This took so much work.
[222:49.23]Wait, what's this?
[222:51.11]That looked really good.
[223:15.21]Ready, ready, careful, fire!
[223:17.95]Whoa, that one was made out of paper.
[223:24.15]Yes!
[223:28.24]Oh, this is the best song!
[223:34.70]Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[223:39.07]Rolling around at the speed of sound.
[223:42.30]Got places to go.
[223:43.84]Gonna follow my rainbow.
[223:46.06]Kissing your mommy when you keep moving on.
[223:48.84]I did this joke already like a year ago.
[223:50.44]Never mind.
[223:51.10]Delete it.
[223:51.60]I did that joke like a year ago.
[223:53.18]I actually did that a year ago.
[223:54.72]And I'm seeing it and I'm watching it in my own head.
[223:56.44]That's a joke we use.
[224:05.08]It is.
[224:05.28]Hey, Grant Dufferin.
[224:10.49]I'll give you Link because that's... You're into Sonic.
[224:15.87]I admittedly am not very much.
[224:17.93]I think it's a cool character.
[224:19.13]I think it's an interesting franchise, but I don't play it.
[224:21.77]I don't really got into it.
[224:29.94]Enable Jerma, please.
[224:30.94]I will enable Jerma, please.
[224:32.00]I will.
[224:32.44]It's not right now.
[224:34.76]Alright, guys.
[224:35.22]I...
[224:42.27]I'm gonna go.
[224:43.01]And I'm not gonna be back for a while.
[224:49.08]What's with the scan lines?
[224:53.02]I will be back.
[224:57.10]I'm gonna try to do this as fast as possible.
[224:58.82]I'm gonna do this every day.
[225:02.65]I'm gonna be going back and forth with the doctor.
[225:05.71]And I'm gonna get this shit settled.
[225:07.21]And I'm gonna come back at 100%.
[225:10.99]I've never tried to do like an extended break like this.
[225:15.85]But it has to be done.
[225:18.77]Because long term, there's a bunch of projects that I'm doing that I want to work on that I want to be 100% for.
[225:24.07]And that's just all there is to it.
[225:27.74]And it's really, really difficult for somebody like me that has been doing this and been around and cares about doing this shit so much to be like, alright, bye, I'm gone.
[225:38.92]And I don't know when I'm coming back.
[225:40.10]A few weeks.
[225:40.94]It's like, I hate to do that.
[225:51.19]He's never coming back.
[225:52.51]Well, that's not true.
[225:55.33]Not true.
[225:57.97]uh I know it'll be fine and I'm just overthinking it like oh my god they're gonna take like what if I'm not back for in like a month what if I have to get a procedure what if I have to have like a surgery or something oh no I'm not gonna be able to be live for like a month two months like that happens whatever oh good I'll tweet more right I'll do more tweets I just it's been a hard call to make because I knew it was coming eventually
[226:29.41]Good night.
[226:29.73]We're going to do the bits.
[226:30.39]We'll hang up a little bit more.
[226:32.43]Thanks for watching.
[226:34.07]And I will see you when I get back at 100.
[226:36.65]100.
[226:36.87]Not another 60, 70% anymore.
[226:41.46]No more of this bullshit.
[226:44.62]I will be tweeting.
[226:45.42]Don't worry.
[226:45.82]I'm not going to just... I'll make a... Don't worry.
[226:49.74]I'll be around.
[226:58.11]And with that, I will see you guys in a couple of weeks.
[227:03.27]I'm not going to put a timeframe on it because let's put it this way.
[227:09.90]If this could, I could figure this out in the next six or seven days or two weeks or more.
[227:20.81]So I would rather just say, I'm going to get this figured out.
[227:25.81]If it's less than a week, it's less than a week.
[227:27.97]If it's more than two weeks, it's more than two weeks.
[227:29.75]And I don't know what it's going to be.
[227:33.27]So he is a different person.
[227:38.02]I'm going to come back as a different person.
[227:40.16]I would come back as a more healthy person.
[227:41.96]That'd be great.
[227:50.59]In the meantime, I am going to set up a auto host with just a big bunch of people that I think are really, really interesting, that I think that I respect, that I think are funny, that I think are cool.
[228:02.32]I'm just going to, there'll be an auto host just for the next couple of weeks of my like streamer list of people that, you know, for you to watch if you want to watch them.
[228:18.72]But let's do the bits.
[228:19.58]Let's go through these.
[228:23.84]Don't need to go very, very fast.
[228:27.46]But... We'll hang out for a little while.
[228:34.50]Thanks for the $2.50.
[228:35.38]I hope things go well.
[228:36.64]Me too.
[228:38.58]I also hope that.
[228:45.95]Because it is in my best interest.
[228:48.83]To make sure that it happens.
[228:53.57]No more half diagnosis.
[228:55.35]No more half... Well, it could be this.
[228:58.70]We'll test you for that.
[228:59.46]Oh, that looked like it was positive.
[229:01.40]Come back.
[229:02.30]Some other time.
[229:02.98]No, no, no, no, no.
[229:03.74]We've talked back and forth.
[229:04.60]Me and the doctor, we're doing it now.
[229:06.14]Now, now, now, now, now.
[229:06.96]Everything.
[229:09.99]Hey, Pixel Mike, thanks for the $5.00.
[229:13.27]Jeremiah, I know full well how scary it is for the doctor to flat out tell you I can't help you.
[229:17.44]I've been bouncing around doctors for about five years, and they still can't really figure it out.
[229:21.76]Although I've improved incredibly, it's still so unnerving not really knowing what's wrong, but I think taking three weeks of recouping will really help.
[229:29.26]I'm sorry to hear that you're also having bullshit to do.
[229:35.58]And when you have some kind of underlying problem, and that's the thing, I have a lot of underlying problems.
[229:42.21]I've had colitis, and I've been diagnosed with irritable bowel disease, and I've been treated for that.
[229:50.39]And I remember a time when I wasn't being treated for that, and it was miserable.
[229:56.33]So I'm kind of putting myself back in that same headspace, where when I was not getting treated for colitis, holy shit, hurry the fuck up, let's go.
[230:10.24]Once I started to get on a regimen, that is completely under control.
[230:14.90]Completely.
[230:16.49]I have not had a irritable bowel disease issue.
[230:21.79]I've not had a colitis issue for years since I got on the right treatment plan.
[230:29.10]Absolutely no problems at all.
[230:30.74]It's 100% managed.
[230:33.92]I'm hoping that same thing can happen.
[230:37.96]Whatever is causing this issue...
[230:41.10]It's just a question of finding it.
[230:43.53]Even if it's some weird condition that is kind of hard to find, I'm going to find it.
[230:48.91]That's what I'm going to do.
[230:53.13]We'll see.
[230:56.40]What is the issue?
[230:58.62]To not completely broken record myself, I have intercostal pain.
[231:05.72]Nerves that run from my... somewhere in the middle of my chest, around my band, to my back, just around my ribs.
[231:15.10]Hurts.
[231:16.32]All day.
[231:17.36]Every day for no reason.
[231:19.36]I didn't get into any accident.
[231:20.78]I didn't have any problems.
[231:22.30]It just hurts to move.
[231:24.58]It hurts to sit for a long time.
[231:26.35]And it just hurts to kind of exist.
[231:28.79]There's no real cause.
[231:31.39]And it's been the bane of my existence for the last probably year and a half.
[231:38.65]It has never gotten better, but it's never really gotten any worse.
[231:45.19]So, obviously, I need to figure this out.
[231:55.03]And the latest is
[231:58.56]And it would make sense, but I don't want to self-diagnose or anything, but this... I had what was potentially shingles a few years ago.
[232:11.40]And sometimes, if you have... And remember, this is not me telling you this is what it is.
[232:18.94]But this is just one of the theories.
[232:21.36]Is that if you have shingles, and shingles is a rash that goes around your... It goes down a nerve.
[232:27.49]And there's a small chance, if you have shingles, that you end up with permanent nerve damage.
[232:35.75]It's neuralgia, is what it's called.
[232:43.36]It's rare.
[232:48.60]But, if it's not that, I also tested positive for potential rheumatoid arthritis.
[232:57.04]So we're going to explore that.
[232:59.99]So it's, I don't know.
[233:05.39]But you can test positive for RA.
[233:07.29]I've been tested for it more than once to make sure that we don't get a false positive.
[233:17.02]But it also might just be costochondritis.
[233:20.55]Which is just inflammation in your rib cage.
[233:23.35]The doctor said that's probably what it is.
[233:25.82]There's been like three or four different opinions on what it could be.
[233:29.24]But it's time to just be like... Which one?
[233:33.46]Which one is it?
[233:36.19]Which one?
[233:38.35]Because if it's something like nerve pain or costochondritis, I go get a small, slightly invasive procedure where they inject a needle into my rib and kind of numb with steroids the nerve and they shut it up.
[233:54.38]And then for some people, you are fucking fine for the rest of your life.
[234:02.83]That has been one of the procedures that I was about to do.
[234:06.51]diagnosed, you have costochondritis, intercostal pain on nerves, we're going to shut the nerve down.
[234:11.56]And I said no.
[234:12.76]Because I wanted to be definitively diagnosed.
[234:17.60]So, I've got a couple more opinions on it.
[234:23.01]If it does turn out to be that, I'm going to do it.
[234:25.17]And that will be what I do over the next few weeks.
[234:27.37]I'm just going to get it done.
[234:37.74]But again, this is why I don't want to... I don't want to tell you guys all this stuff.
[234:46.08]But I kind of have to.
[234:47.64]Because you don't just disappear for three weeks without me giving you some kind of reasoning.
[234:53.84]Right?
[234:55.38]Oh, I have a pain.
[234:57.00]Bye.
[234:57.40]See you next month.
[234:59.21]No, that doesn't work like that.
[235:00.25]You guys kind of need to know.
[235:08.47]He's going to come back as Jex.
[235:21.00]Yeah, I'll be alright.
[235:24.16]It's just something I don't want to have to deal with anymore.
[235:26.34]If you were here in the beginning of the stream, I'm going to parrot what I said.
[235:29.35]After the green screen DLC...
[235:33.17]It was bad.
[235:33.89]It was bad.
[235:36.37]To a point where I just was kind of looking.
[235:37.83]I was lying on my floor.
[235:40.99]Just hanging out looking at the ceiling going.
[235:44.03]This has got to stop.
[235:45.11]I got to get this figured out.
[235:47.13]And that's where I kind of had the float of the ideas around to do it.
[235:52.31]Why did you break dance?
[235:53.93]Because I was having fun.
[235:55.93]I was having too much fun.
[235:57.59]And that's all I cared about.
[235:59.87]And I would do it again if I had the chance right now.
[236:04.26]It wasn't that, though.
[236:05.92]I did that in the first 20 minutes of that stream.
[236:10.17]It was just a combination of actively moving around.
[236:15.72]Screwing me up.
[236:21.17]Because there are other times that you guys don't see where I get up and I move around and I feel alright.
[236:27.61]But if I, you know, if I do anything that requires me to rotate, it's like, oh, that fucking hurts a lot.
[236:34.25]Well, now I'm sore now.
[236:35.47]I'm sore for the rest of the day now.
[236:36.87]Why?
[236:38.49]So it's not just, oh, I must have done something on that stream.
[236:40.69]This happens on a, this is a daily occurrence.
[236:46.22]And I don't want to scare anybody.
[236:47.94]I'm like, oh my god, Manga Ash.
[236:49.83]Oh shit, he's gone.
[236:50.79]What's happening?
[236:51.33]Is he going to be back?
[236:52.81]Yes.
[236:54.09]Please, trust me.
[236:58.70]But we'll move on.
[237:00.76]Donut, 500.
[237:01.20]Thanks for the 35 bucks.
[237:05.42]3,500 bits.
[237:06.06]Jerma, take the time.
[237:07.40]You need to figure this shit out.
[237:09.20]My girlfriend has a bunch of mystery health issues and the doctors haven't been helpful at all.
[237:14.04]Do your thing, man.
[237:15.44]You're able to find what's going on with your body.
[237:18.95]I bring happiness to thousands of gamers all around the world.
[237:24.23]I plan on figuring it out.
[237:26.17]I'm going in hot.
[237:28.37]I'm going in.
[237:30.57]I had a doctor's appointment a few days ago.
[237:33.61]And this is exactly what we both went back and forth.
[237:35.55]It's a great doctor.
[237:36.28]They really, really understand.
[237:38.50]They're super on top of this.
[237:42.18]And I've been told from this doctor that we're going to get this figured out.
[237:46.42]We're going to do whatever it takes.
[237:48.02]And they're going to figure it out.
[237:50.80]So, I have the utmost confidence that this doctor will figure it out.
[237:58.55]Hey, S. Halko, thanks for the 300 bits.
[238:03.75]Please, please, please take care of yourself, Jerma.
[238:05.50]I know I'm not speaking alone when I say that we all care about your health.
[238:09.00]I know that's why I'm doing this.
[238:10.26]I'm taking it dead seriously.
[238:15.10]I am taking it very seriously.
[238:17.15]Otherwise, I wouldn't just kind of disappear for a while.
[238:21.51]Hey Kiko, thanks for the 300 bits.
[238:23.40]The name game, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Bo-Burma, Bonana-Fana-Fo-Furma, Fee-Fi-Mo-Murma, Jerma.
[238:32.14]That's been a long time since I've heard that one.
[238:39.95]Thank you Fredel Schlitz for the 250.
[238:42.57]Jerma post stream chat needs to know, what happened to Chase Fairbanks?
[238:46.78]Undercover idiot.
[238:49.52]Oh, what you're probably referring to is, I used to be on Newgrounds, and over the years, on Newgrounds, you know, it was an animation site, and we were, you know, at the time, wanted to try to get something, a comedy show on Newgrounds animation going.
[239:11.43]It's just one of those things.
[239:12.87]The hundred million different ideas.
[239:15.57]Over the two decades or so.
[239:17.77]I can't even believe I'm saying that out loud.
[239:22.43]He founded Game Grumps?
[239:25.34]No, I didn't.
[239:27.98]He was a porn actor.
[239:37.06]But no, yeah.
[239:39.52]Like I said before, I...
[239:42.36]Ideas come and ideas go.
[239:47.02]And some of them are better than others.
[239:50.24]Some of them are funny and some of them are not so funny.
[239:55.32]I can tell you, I can probably count on 50 hands over the last 20 years.
[240:01.28]Me trying to come up with an interesting idea with a group of people.
[240:07.60]And...
[240:10.05]It doesn't work out.
[240:11.86]And it was not funny.
[240:12.88]He's... Oh, no.
[240:19.62]It's passed.
[240:22.96]I wanted to be like a voice actor.
[240:24.65]I was on Newgrounds.
[240:26.09]That's not... What the fuck do I care?
[240:32.33]Who says count on 50 hands?
[240:33.91]Me.
[240:36.38]You have a Fiverr account.
[240:39.33]You know, some people on Fiverr make a shitload of money.
[240:41.77]I don't actually have one, though.
[240:44.49]Show us your old work.
[240:46.45]It's on Newgrounds.
[240:48.81]That's just not... That's just there.
[240:50.68]That's how I... Guys, that's how... How do you think I met Blordow?
[240:56.78]Blord, look at the screen right now.
[241:09.10]The only thing that is on Newgrounds is Salty Swamp.
[241:12.80]Oh, I think there's a couple more things.
[241:16.84]That's Blordow Origins.
[241:18.83]From voice acting to e-clown.
[241:28.55]My ass is a Salty Swamp.
[241:30.72]Good one.
[241:35.79]Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of you guys severely underestimate just how long I've wanted to, like, do entertainment.
[241:43.60]It's been, like, it's been a long time since I was, like, 15.
[241:51.87]I've been around.
[241:52.55]But anyways, let's move on.
[242:02.48]Let us continue.
[242:07.53]Jeremy, you have to explain this.
[242:10.65]If you... If you want me to go explain... A... A like 16 year old like post I did on Newgrounds.
[242:21.48]I can't even remember what I had for breakfast three days ago.
[242:25.42]What are you... What are you talking about?
[242:31.78]Voice of one, two, three... Yeah, this is all... You guys... This is all old shit.
[242:39.14]Yeah, I had a voice acting page with a demo on it and whatever I wanted to- I'm trying to practice.
[242:45.12]I'm practicing.
[242:45.91]How do you think I got so good?
[242:51.75]My voice can be changed to sound extremely elderly.
[242:53.93]Kind old man.
[242:54.93]Yeah, you're alright.
[242:56.39]Let's see.
[242:57.07]Let's see what you did on you.
[242:58.17]Let's see what post you made when you were fucking 17, huh?
[243:03.95]That's a good post.
[243:06.01]It was explaining who I am.
[243:19.07]Oh, Jeremy, you're 17.
[243:26.75]No, I made a lot of friends on Newgrounds.
[243:30.59]I had, Lord Dow is a lifelong friend.
[243:34.07]I cherish my time that I had on there as much as a fucking weirdo that I was.
[243:39.04]And you know what?
[243:39.42]I don't think much has changed.
[243:49.72]Like, I feel like some of that shit I would say now.
[243:58.92]You sound so young.
[244:06.62]You hated anime.
[244:08.92]What do you want me to do?
[244:10.38]What?
[244:11.20]Who cares?
[244:11.88]Oh no, he said he didn't like anime.
[244:22.21]Mom's making cookies from Baskin Robbins is the best flavor.
[244:26.57]Yeah, not much has fucking changed, guys.
[244:34.18]I like to think I've grown up a little and some of my opinions have matured.
[244:39.38]Since, you know, I was like fucking, you know, sick, like 17 years old.
[244:43.11]I'm 35 this next year.
[244:47.83]What do you want me to tell you?
[244:51.33]He's too old.
[244:53.55]No, you were not 17.
[244:55.01]You were 19.
[244:55.37]I don't know.
[245:00.47]I don't know what you want me to say.
[245:06.15]I was an artist trying to take on the world.
[245:10.14]That's half a lifetime ago.
[245:14.42]Yeah, it is.
[245:15.28]It is.
[245:21.82]Jerma is your cool older cousin that gets you drunk.
[245:26.98]Why did I read that?
[245:29.98]Hey, Dark Soul, thanks for the $2.50.
[245:32.73]What the fuck are you even talking about?
[245:45.18]Do you do taxes?
[245:46.12]Yes, I do my taxes.
[245:47.66]We've already gone over this.
[245:50.81]Enable this.
[245:51.43]I will.
[245:52.17]I will turn that on after the stream is over.
[245:54.65]I will turn it on.
[245:55.07]I will log in and I'll turn it on.
[245:56.02]I promise.
[246:09.90]We will... Do you guys think that I have...
[246:17.17]a computer or something from like 2001?
[246:20.35]Or 2004?
[246:22.65]You think I own like old computer?
[246:28.52]Where do you think I'm gonna get this stuff?
[246:34.80]Guys, I don't even have my official Jerma985 banner on this computer.
[246:45.07]I don't... I don't know where the fuck that even is.
[246:56.97]You're a fake.
[247:00.66]Why would I still have like any old voice acting, any old footage?
[247:07.44]Dude, I'm fucking 35, man.
[247:13.18]And you guys have seen some videos.
[247:17.64]And some animations.
[247:25.48]I am still young, you're right.
[247:32.19]Is chat saying that you're old again?
[247:33.95]Probably.
[247:38.29]Probably.
[247:49.04]He's a young, old person.
[248:01.33]Stop being mean, chat.
[248:02.77]They're not being mean.
[248:03.51]They're fine.
[248:05.85]Alright, we have to get through the bits.
[248:08.35]We need to do a western film.
[248:10.13]I wanted to make a western full motion video game.
[248:12.89]We talked about it.
[248:18.50]I'd like to help spread the infection.
[248:21.36]Yeah.
[248:28.81]Anyways, let's continue.
[248:33.35]Rosie Breyer, thanks for the $5.
[248:34.81]Feel better soon.
[248:42.09]We love you.
[248:42.65]I appreciate that.
[248:51.63]It means a lot.
[248:53.82]Specifically because, uh, this is what I, this is like what I do now.
[248:58.34]You know?
[249:01.46]This is what I want to do every day.
[249:04.82]Projects.
[249:06.36]I mean, obviously, we're talking about, you know, oh, what about like, you know, stuff from 20, 15, 20 years ago or whatever.
[249:11.53]This has been something I've cared about for fucking decades.
[249:16.47]So it does suck and it does hurt to be here and be like, see you later.
[249:22.26]For an indefinite amount of time.
[249:23.42]And it has to be done.
[249:27.64]So... I can just thank everybody that's here.
[249:32.46]For as long as you've been here.
[249:45.34]I get to fulfill dreams that I've had since I was a teenager.
[249:53.68]Obviously, judging by the last couple conversations.
[250:01.51]See you in three years.
[250:02.43]Not that long.
[250:08.36]Just keep an eye on the Twitter.
[250:10.56]I will update you every couple days.
[250:12.28]Every two or three days, I'll make sure I tweet.
[250:17.34]Hey, Michael Smels, thanks for the 300 bits.
[250:20.02]I love you, Jerma.
[250:21.16]Chat loves you, too.
[250:22.90]You've helped me through so much, and I can't thank you enough.
[250:24.60]Today's my last day of senior year of high school.
[250:28.58]I've known you since early TF2 days.
[250:31.66]Shout out to the Discord subs channel.
[250:33.74]You guys are the best.
[250:34.40]I'm rambling, but you're just great, dude.
[250:37.57]Thank you.
[250:37.85]Appreciate it.
[250:42.55]The servers.
[250:43.89]He knew you from the servers.
[250:48.85]yeah but anyways gnarly thanks for the thousand bits don't tell me what to do Jerma I'll give you as much money as I'm comfortable
[251:15.61]Yeah, but it's not about how much money anyone's comfortable giving.
[251:20.07]It's that... I want to make sure that you're paying for something that's worth paying for.
[251:25.97]It's always been like that.
[251:29.53]So, obviously, anytime somebody gives a bunch of money, I want to make sure that you're able to do it too.
[251:36.61]You're able to actually give that kind of money.
[251:43.16]Because I know that a lot of people...
[251:46.19]Maybe you can't.
[251:47.89]So, obviously, it gets to that point where I just want to make sure that you're doing fine, too.
[251:54.22]And not worrying about, like, money and shit and giving it to me.
[251:57.70]Hey, hey, just take this.
[251:58.50]Take this.
[251:59.38]I don't make that much money.
[252:00.70]I saw the Jerma census.
[252:03.46]I saw it.
[252:05.80]Like, 80% of the people that watch this channel don't make any money.
[252:10.84]I saw that, well, it's a small sample size.
[252:13.86]I did see it.
[252:14.36]Yes, I did.
[252:17.45]If you haven't seen it, people can go ahead and link it.
[252:26.74]I wasn't part of it.
[252:27.50]I think there was like 2,000 people, right?
[252:29.72]I did see it.
[252:33.67]But I didn't want to turn this into a, oh, give me money because now I'm going to take a medical leave and I have to get this medical shit figured out.
[252:39.91]Now pay me.
[252:40.99]That's not what the point is.
[252:42.71]It's never what I want the point to be.
[252:49.20]So, I know, I really appreciate it.
[252:53.42]You say, just take it.
[252:55.05]And I will.
[252:56.59]But I will speak that as well.
[252:58.31]I will tell you that as well.
[252:59.21]I want to make that clear.
[253:08.58]Anyways, thank you to... I completely glazed over Dark Soul's message.
[253:13.62]Dark Soul...
[253:16.21]for 250 said don't believe this imposter's lies he's only taking off time so he can prefer to skin walker abilities you're telling me this is the guy I subbed to yeah I got a bunch of bright okay hold on I gotta defend myself here I've got I have to go on defense this is this is really bright studio lights shining three feet in front of me into my face
[253:48.01]Why do you think my eyes are so dilated?
[253:50.92]I'm right in front of the studio lighting.
[253:58.45]You look like a demon.
[253:59.49]Yeah, I know.
[254:00.15]I've seen the images.
[254:03.93]I've seen the images.
[254:06.49]You're a fucking alien.
[254:18.85]Well, maybe I am, and that's okay, right?
[254:22.41]Rick and Morty eyes?
[254:23.45]It really was.
[254:31.85]That's fucking creepy.
[254:38.70]Hey, edgy shadow, thanks a thousand bits.
[254:41.32]Take my money, you hack.
[254:48.18]I'll take it, alright.
[254:50.73]Hey Kiko, thanks for the three dollars.
[254:52.43]Hey again, Jerma.
[254:55.55]One time I had a daydream that me and the subs Discord chat robbed a bank to give you bits, but then the police started chasing us.
[255:01.49]But you were part of the police squad that was chasing us and we blew up the car you were in.
[255:07.40]Anyways, bye.
[255:11.98]Wait, this is a daydream?
[255:14.78]This is not a regular dream, this is a daydream.
[255:18.20]Wait, I thought this was a real, like, a dream dream.
[255:21.32]Oh my god.
[255:25.97]Okay.
[255:26.43]Well, that makes that a little stranger.
[255:27.69]Hey, Jerm is the best.
[255:31.15]Thanks for 250.
[255:32.21]Here's to germy.
[255:32.87]Here's to germy's physical health.
[255:37.75]Alright.
[255:38.93]Thank you.
[255:39.33]Here's to yours as well.
[255:42.11]Hey, still best friends, thanks for the 300 bits.
[255:44.71]Do what you gotta do.
[255:45.68]That's what my plan is.
[255:46.76]Plan on coming back with no issues.
[255:53.80]It's been a long time coming.
[255:54.60]I'm gonna go for it.
[255:58.06]SticksRenegade, thanks for 250.
[255:59.33]Jerma, welcome back.
[256:00.17]Guess what happened?
[256:01.37]My neighbor's dog was biting hard at another dog.
[256:04.53]What?
[256:05.79]I got bit trying to help.
[256:08.41]Almost took my nail off and broke my finger.
[256:12.83]Have I ever been bitten before?
[256:14.09]No.
[256:15.53]That sounds horrible.
[256:17.91]No, I've never been bit by a dog?
[256:20.27]Or attacked by any kind of animal or anything?
[256:23.03]No, never.
[256:23.41]I can't imagine how stressful and horrible that is, though.
[256:29.76]Hope you're alright.
[256:30.26]That's an insane message.
[256:41.02]I mean, I got bit by a dog.
[256:45.86]I mean, that's... It's insane.
[256:47.82]I mean, that's a wild story.
[256:49.90]That's a crazy story.
[256:51.00]Hope you're alright though.
[256:56.19]Recover.
[256:57.53]That's... That's oof.
[257:01.93]Wild.
[257:03.59]Hey, Windar, thanks for the $5.
[257:05.03]Hey, man, thanks for all you do.
[257:06.11]You've heard it a million times.
[257:08.05]You truly are one of the best content creators out there.
[257:10.81]You're a content god.
[257:11.96]I mean, I'm glad you think that.
[257:14.86]Take all the time you need.
[257:15.62]A dead Jerma isn't a good Jerma, not implying you would die.
[257:18.02]Aha, I hope not.
[257:20.16]So again, thank you.
[257:21.54]You've made my life better by being someone I can look to and have a smile.
[257:25.71]You're a genuine and caring person, but your health takes top priority.
[257:28.43]Thank you for all that you do.
[257:35.88]Thank you for doing everything for me.
[257:39.66]I don't get to take three week breaks for my health if I don't do what I'm doing right now.
[257:44.57]You allow me to do that, so thank you.
[257:48.45]I'm incredibly fortunate in that realm.
[257:55.67]I'm saying three weeks.
[257:57.61]I don't think it'll take that long.
[258:00.56]But I'm just saying it just to say it.
[258:01.80]It's kind of the long end of the spectrum there.
[258:06.34]Jack the Bank, thanks for 1,500 bits.
[258:08.32]Love you, Jerma.
[258:08.93]Everyone, don't listen to him.
[258:10.13]Please donate all your money.
[258:11.39]Don't do that.
[258:11.91]I probably shouldn't have even read that.
[258:13.63]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[258:15.93]Hey, Net, thanks for 1,000 bits.
[258:17.51]These are pity bits.
[258:20.55]Thank you.
[258:23.23]Thank you.
[258:27.10]Clammy Bob, $42.
[258:29.50]I caught it already, but it's a lot of money.
[258:31.12]They did it for the badge.
[258:33.32]It's so much money.
[258:37.33]Hey, Dark Soul, thanks for 250 again.
[258:38.93]If you don't want those bits, can I take some of them back?
[258:41.93]There are no refunds.
[258:45.79]No refunds.
[258:50.18]So make sure you get it right, because I can't give them back.
[258:54.12]jermaGrin.
[258:55.10]Hey, don't hit the table.
[258:58.28]Hey, Kinky Creatures, thanks for $5.
[259:00.28]Jerma High, thanks for helping me with my anxiety.
[259:02.05]Here's some money for your mecha suit.
[259:04.83]Be nice.
[259:05.83]Thank you.
[259:08.66]Thanks for hanging out.
[259:10.90]Radis Raccoon, $3.
[259:12.28]I'm super sad that there isn't going to be a stream for a few weeks.
[259:15.08]But I hope you figure out what's going on.
[259:17.22]Me too.
[259:20.67]I hopefully will not have to be away for that long.
[259:24.85]I'm just going to go for as long as it takes to do it.
[259:28.83]However long that is.
[259:29.43]Focusing every day only on that.
[259:34.04]Thank you.
[259:39.95]Donut 500, another thousand bits.
[259:42.75]You da best.
[259:45.57]Me.
[259:46.91]Thank you.
[259:49.27]I'm glad you think that.
[259:51.03]I'm glad you don't think I'm the worst.
[259:52.43]Appreciate it.
[259:58.03]Control X, thanks for a thousand bits.
[259:59.50]They say CUTE in all capitals.
[260:03.56]All capitals.
[260:06.62]Hey, Jaden's Brain $5.
[260:07.68]I've been in the same situation.
[260:09.38]I was sick in various ways for 10 years.
[260:11.75]And the doctors were useless.
[260:13.85]I don't know how much money I spent on them, so I want to help you get through this as much as possible.
[260:18.11]In the end, I had to figure it all on my own.
[260:19.71]And I was right.
[260:21.69]And now I'm getting traded.
[260:22.43]Hope you don't have to go through that.
[260:24.93]Please appreciate video games.
[260:26.41]They are the best.
[260:29.55]Glad you finally got it figured out.
[260:35.24]I've got a handful of good leads where things have come back positive for things and then now you do the next step.
[260:45.60]And I don't want to wait to do them.
[260:46.62]I don't want to do them on free time.
[260:49.18]I just want to do them now.
[260:53.87]Take care of yourself.
[260:56.49]Thanks for the five dollars.
[260:58.81]A gray angel.
[260:59.57]Thanks for 250.
[261:00.25]We can rebuild him.
[261:00.95]We have the technology.
[261:01.79]We can make him better than he was.
[261:03.06]Better, stronger, faster.
[261:04.10]The six million bits boomer.
[261:11.92]Nice.
[261:13.66]Nice.
[261:16.70]Gear broth.
[261:17.44]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[261:19.97]Jerma jumping on stream for a moment here to donate.
[261:23.01]Hope you feel better.
[261:24.17]Take care and all the time that you need.
[261:25.73]I will.
[261:29.28]That I can assure you.
[261:32.14]I promise that the next time that you see my face live on stream, I will have the news to tell you that I am getting this under control.
[261:41.69]And it's being treated.
[261:43.13]And I'm ready.
[261:43.69]And I'm back.
[261:44.11]We're not going to have to even have another conversation about this when I'm back.
[261:52.40]I hope to have it pretty much toast by then.
[261:57.18]Oh, Royal Dawi, thanks for the $11.
[261:58.90]Jeremiah, I had a funny dream where you had gotten your hands on my credit card and you were holding it up to the camera while streaming.
[262:07.36]When I asked you not to do that, you said that's ridiculous because everyone lies on their credit card.
[262:13.12]I asked how that makes any sense and you wanted a small rant about how you lied on your card.
[262:17.94]All the while, chat erupted with people saying things like illegal streamer Omega Lul.
[262:22.18]Anyways, keep doing what you do, man.
[262:25.46]Everybody lies on their credit card.
[262:27.72]Was it a YouTube account?
[262:33.15]Yeah, whatever.
[262:33.79]How old am I?
[262:34.41]YouTube?
[262:34.91]I'm like 60.
[262:35.63]Who cares?
[262:40.03]Thanks for the 11 bucks.
[262:41.07]Max Akito, thanks for the thousand bits.
[262:43.23]Do you like Minesweeper?
[262:46.41]No, not really.
[262:47.29]No.
[262:49.47]No.
[262:53.71]It's cool to play for like 5 seconds and then you realize that you can't play on anything other than difficulty level 0.
[263:00.75]And you have to stop.
[263:04.01]It's a neat little trick.
[263:05.45]Every once in a while.
[263:08.73]Hey fishies, thanks for the $5.
[263:11.92]I'm donating because I want to do exactly what you want us not to do, because I'm a rebel.
[263:17.17]But for real, I'm glad you're taking a break to heal and get back to 100%.
[263:19.39]What's important in your life is yourself and your own health, and I think everyone is content with your choice.
[263:27.07]You've done much more than any of us could ask.
[263:29.93]It's about darn time you make some time to do what's best for you.
[263:33.37]We love you, Jerma985, Mr. Funnyman.
[263:37.58]Yeah, and I know.
[263:39.66]I know that I need to do this because I can't just pretend like it's not happening.
[263:45.19]There is no more, well, I can just stream for four hours a day and wear the brace and next month I'll have it looked at.
[263:53.23]We'll keep going.
[263:57.62]No.
[263:57.84]I really do appreciate the fact that a lot of you guys are willing to stick to me.
[264:01.66]Stick with it.
[264:03.34]And two or three weeks, a month, whatever, something, if anything, I don't know how long.
[264:09.39]There's a lot of people that are going to stay.
[264:11.35]Will people leave?
[264:12.51]I don't know.
[264:13.87]But I can't even... That's not even crossing my brain at the moment.
[264:19.97]Like, whoa, whoa.
[264:21.11]But Jerma, what about your growth?
[264:22.99]You've had such a huge growth.
[264:24.55]You don't want to stop that now.
[264:26.97]Well, whatever.
[264:29.77]I was never one to really give a shit about
[264:33.67]numbers and how many people were here or how much money that I take in today I don't I don't that doesn't I don't care you know I mean I mean that's a lie of course I care of course I care about how many people are here because that means that people like the stream and I'm doing something that I think maybe people think is funny and obviously the more people that are here the better
[264:58.25]But I can't let something like that take over my life.
[265:01.91]And be like, well, who cares?
[265:03.49]I'll just... I'm going to keep streaming.
[265:05.61]Every day.
[265:07.77]No.
[265:10.70]Maximize profits.
[265:11.78]100 or bust.
[265:17.56]I didn't stream every day anyways.
[265:19.64]And we're still on this path.
[265:20.60]Right?
[265:21.06]I'm going to get it fixed.
[265:29.89]Hey, Fishies.
[265:33.15]Wait, no, you didn't do twice.
[265:34.09]You just did once.
[265:35.68]$5 from Fishies.
[265:36.40]That's what it was.
[265:37.14]And that's all it was.
[265:37.82]Appreciate it.
[265:40.64]Budgie, thanks for $5.
[265:42.10]Been watching the streams for a few months and I can finally send some bits to the number one e-clown.
[265:45.48]Take care during your break, Jerem.
[265:47.70]I can't wait for more second channel content.
[265:49.48]Is it going to be a lot?
[265:57.92]There's been a good, at least three or four people that have been brought on, or they're about to be brought on.
[266:04.32]There's gonna be a lot of videos on the second channel.
[266:07.54]A lot.
[266:07.86]Stay tuned.
[266:12.57]Hey, Pugles, thanks for the $5.
[266:13.73]Hope you're recovering alright.
[266:16.35]Just a quick tip from one crackhead to another.
[266:19.07]If a drug-sniffing dog ever catches you, just say, he who smelt it dealt it, and they're forced to arrest the dog.
[266:27.65]But, um, chi, right?
[266:28.95]That's actually pretty good.
[266:35.47]Hey, Red Walrus, thanks for the thousand bits.
[266:37.23]Jerma, it's Red Walrus, the one with the shoe-sized jermaRat and the Warhammer jermaRat.
[266:41.33]It obviously needs to be said that I commissioned those rats from the very special snuggle-bill, snuggle-able suite on Etsy.
[266:49.50]She's super cool and would love to make more for customers, she said.
[266:52.02]I'll provide a link on Discord if that's okay.
[266:53.92]Yeah, let's go for it.
[267:00.68]I do not own the rats.
[267:04.16]Is Nicole and Oscar going to be on the second channel soon?
[267:08.34]Hate sucks.
[267:09.10]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[267:10.10]Hope you feel better, Boomer.
[267:11.20]Thanks for the $15.
[267:11.54]I appreciate it.
[267:12.54]I'm going to try.
[267:13.14]I'm going to go for it.
[267:15.46]Ajax the Mediocre, 2,000 bits, $20.
[267:18.72]Jerma, thank you for literally bending over backwards to make us laugh.
[267:21.83]Hope you're feeling better, big guy.
[267:26.01]Me too.
[267:27.97]I hope I feel better too.
[267:34.84]I'm going to do whatever it takes.
[267:38.64]Thanks for the money.
[267:39.48]Thanks for the big money.
[267:41.46]jermaFireman, thanks for the $3.
[267:42.82]They just say, Fireman, emote, that's all that's here.
[267:48.15]Whimsical Moose, thanks for $2.50.
[267:49.49]I know we all will miss you.
[267:51.27]Take as long of a break as you need.
[267:54.39]Your health is more important than these silly streams.
[267:57.24]Can't wait to see what's in store when you're at 100%.
[267:58.40]But these streams are important.
[268:02.72]You're a major part of my life.
[268:04.66]So it's a major part of the decision making when I decide if I'm going to do something like this.
[268:11.87]Thank you.
[268:13.93]Vladkovich, thanks for the five dollars.
[268:15.75]Magic stream was your sexiest short hair arc.
[268:20.11]This is the sexiest.
[268:28.95]I mean, I'm probably going to have this hair soon.
[268:32.81]Hey, Germa100's gonna come back.
[268:34.57]With this kind of hair.
[268:37.73]Anyway, we're talking Germa100, not Germa65.
[268:39.47]Thank you.
[268:47.50]Appreciate the compliment.
[268:48.38]Hey, DouglasRatman1000Bits, no message, just $10 given to me and handed to my hand, and I just closed my hand and I put it in my pocket.
[268:56.92]Thanks for the $10.
[269:00.37]S. Haluko, thanks for the 500 bits.
[269:02.25]I made the Jerma Reddit soy face and I feel the need to repent.
[269:07.59]Wait a minute.
[269:07.89]Why is this the Jerma Reddit slash soy face?
[269:12.19]Why are you giving me that moniker?
[269:13.65]This is the Jerma Reddit face?
[269:16.69]No, no, no.
[269:17.45]This already has a name.
[269:21.79]It's not my thing.
[269:22.71]This is not me.
[269:23.49]It's not my thing.
[269:26.95]Don't give me that moniker.
[269:33.74]A kill piss.
[269:35.60]Thanks for the $5, Jerma.
[269:38.08]A college roommate and I were separated because of the virus, and I didn't get to move out at the same time.
[269:43.66]Before we did, your content was something we enjoyed together, and the Space Channel 5 stream highlights is what started it all.
[269:50.48]Even though now we're miles apart, your streams have been bringing us together and letting us laugh like we're in the dorms again.
[269:57.05]Thanks for being a part of the laughs and memories we shared in 318.
[269:59.25]Stay safe.
[270:04.18]That's what I used to do.
[270:05.06]When I was in college, I was just trying to make each other laugh.
[270:06.94]Trying to make my friends laugh.
[270:08.05]Make my roommates laugh.
[270:12.03]Have them make me laugh.
[270:13.13]It was just about having fun.
[270:15.39]Glad I can be part of that.
[270:16.63]I'm glad I can be a part of that.
[270:18.41]It's important.
[270:22.00]It has a 2.6 GPA.
[270:22.96]Yeah, I didn't say I was the brightest bulb.
[270:25.92]But I last a long time.
[270:28.90]I'm like a LED, guys.
[270:30.26]Am I the brightest bulb in the room?
[270:31.90]No, but I'm gonna last 10 years.
[270:35.05]Never gonna have to replace me.
[270:38.19]Oh, those halogens.
[270:39.45]Ah, that bright and hot.
[270:40.67]Yeah, okay.
[270:41.65]Bright and hot.
[270:42.37]Wow.
[270:43.03]You burn out in two years.
[270:44.09]You burn out in six months.
[270:45.05]Get the fuck out of here.
[270:46.53]Fluorescence?
[270:48.19]Oh, they last a while.
[270:50.17]What's that?
[270:50.63]They're full of toxic chemicals.
[270:53.17]And if you breathe in, they cause diseases.
[270:55.93]And shit.
[270:56.55]Oh, yeah.
[270:57.03]Oh, cool.
[270:57.57]Good for you.
[270:59.05]Not me.
[270:59.69]I'm an LED.
[271:02.99]Last ten years.
[271:03.55]It won't be that bright.
[271:09.40]Where was I going with that?
[271:10.11]I don't know.
[271:11.17]I was going somewhere with that.
[271:12.05]I was going somewhere.
[271:15.99]How does that end?
[271:21.23]Toxic streamer.
[271:28.48]Hey, Convobreaker, thanks for 250.
[271:29.96]I know you said no already, but Pikman 1 is literally a six and a half hour game.
[271:34.25]You get that time spread across 29 days to get 29 parts, plus one free part on the tutorial day with no time limit.
[271:41.79]For the time between days, it should be exactly two four-hour streams, perfect for health.
[271:46.23]And since you're a god of a gamer, you can finish before day 30.
[271:49.14]Also, please, for the love of God, add the Germapolize emote, otherwise your breakdancing will mean nothing.
[271:58.04]I'm gonna add it.
[271:59.64]I'm gonna add it.
[272:01.14]I promise.
[272:04.08]I just have to log in.
[272:05.04]I think it'll be the last thing I do before the stream turns off.
[272:09.02]Add it now.
[272:09.52]Hold on a second.
[272:13.70]Okay.
[272:16.16]There you go.
[272:28.30]Done deal.
[272:34.07]It's there.
[272:38.23]Hey, Donut500, thanks for $5.
[272:40.39]They say, here's some funky bits because you're epic.
[272:43.51]Thanks.
[272:45.33]Appreciate it.
[272:46.66]I just enabled it.
[272:47.66]Refresh your screens.
[272:50.20]Refresh your page.
[272:50.96]Hey, X Inc., thanks for the $2.50.
[272:53.98]Did you know that Bela Lugosi is dead?
[272:55.72]I do.
[272:57.32]Yes, I know.
[272:59.15]Green, thanks for $5.
[273:00.43]Jerma, just wanted to send some love to my favorite streamer.
[273:02.17]After so many years, I felt like you deserve something for all the laughs.
[273:07.89]You watching is enough for me to care about.
[273:10.13]I'll take your $5, though.
[273:14.51]I really appreciate it.
[273:16.45]I am honored to be your favorite streamer.
[273:20.45]Sometimes I can't believe that that's real.

[273:51.30]Hey, Jerma, it's nice to see you back after you turned into the Tin Man.
[273:55.30]Hope you're doing well.
[273:56.72]Still currently trying to get my shit together.
[273:58.95]I think I'm getting there.
[274:00.09]Anyways, have a good night.
[274:04.23]I'm gonna get there.
[274:05.85]You enabled this emote on the wrong account.
[274:08.33]No, I didn't.
[274:09.11]I only have one Twitch account.
[274:12.76]Well, I mean, if you don't count buying every man 01110011 space 011.
[274:15.30]Of course.
[274:20.93]Or like all the 12 Master of Comedies that exist.
[274:32.98]Poor monster gave this some... There was some $50 drops here.
[274:36.54]Poor monster gave $50.
[274:37.92]Thanks for the stream and positive art reception despite your onset of dementia.
[274:42.88]Please take care of yourself because I'm dealing with grandma in hospice and I don't want to see you push yourself too hard and be gone too.
[274:50.31]Oh yeah.
[274:53.24]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[274:57.98]My onset of dementia.
[275:03.42]I'll be back at 100.
[275:04.32]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[275:10.17]Moss Lion, thanks for 250.
[275:11.39]First you break quarantine to buy Funko Pops, and then you break it again to film yourself making baby food on a public beach.
[275:17.45]Please stop.
[275:17.99]You're going to get us all killed.
[275:20.79]It's a fake beach.
[275:24.20]That was a fake beach.
[275:28.98]Freudian weapon.
[275:29.64]Thanks for 250.
[275:30.34]Best of luck getting your medical issues sorted.
[275:31.70]I'll be safe, healthy, and FIA.
[275:33.14]And I'll see you when you get back.
[275:34.92]You funny streamer guy.
[275:36.54]Hey, that goes for chat too.
[275:38.56]Right?
[275:40.84]I'll pop in.
[275:41.50]I'm going to pop in from time to time.
[275:42.58]I'm not just going to disappear.
[275:45.43]Charlie is okay.
[275:46.23]Thanks for $5.
[275:47.79]Just $5.
[275:48.61]Thank you, Charlie.
[275:49.87]No message.

[275:53.03]A couple of them.
[275:56.83]Mel Scribbles, thanks for 300 bits.
[275:58.69]Jerm, I'm glad you liked my auto and werelord art.
[276:01.07]It was very, very cute.
[276:03.51]Also, I don't know how I figured out how to post the Animal Crossing one on Imgur rather than directly in Discord, but oh well.
[276:09.24]Hope you make a quick recovery during your time off.
[276:11.10]Take care of yourself.
[276:11.88]I'm gonna try.
[276:18.98]Rip Kit Fisto gave 20 community subs.
[276:24.45]I didn't even see that.
[276:31.66]Thanks for the 20 subs.
[276:33.38]Porcupine, thanks for the $15.
[276:35.42]Rip Kit Fisto.
[276:37.90]Is this an ancient meme that I think is just funny now?
[276:40.70]I catch all these so late.
[276:42.09]I'm sorry, guys.
[276:44.21]Borkus, Borkus, 20 community subs.
[276:50.97]So many community subs.
[276:51.99]It's so much money.
[276:52.78]I hope I spend it well.
[276:56.85]Thank you, Morkus, for your huge community sub drop.
[276:59.61]Thank you, John Scary, for the $15.
[277:02.79]Jeremy985 Elbertson, I've loved you since high school.
[277:06.47]Please be my boyfriend.
[277:07.85]And then they say, forehead, forehead, forehead, forehead.
[277:14.68]I'm sorry, I'm currently taken.
[277:16.18]I'm taken.
[277:16.58]I'm not.
[277:20.29]Bumblebuck thanks for the 300 bits.
[277:21.71]I've been watching your pro gaming content for around seven years now.
[277:25.37]So here's $3 in return.
[277:27.43]Now if you could do me a huge favor and read the rest of this message with no background music, it would be greatly appreciated.
[277:35.58]Make us big, please, Mr. Scientist.
[277:38.10]I wish for $15.
[277:39.92]Him to be safe.
[277:41.62]I am... Hold on.
[277:44.88]Make us big, please, Mr. Scientist.
[277:47.99]I wish for $15.
[277:51.44]Him to be safe.
[277:54.34]I am Fast Jerma.
[277:56.82]I am Purple Alien.
[277:59.47]Magic Frog.
[278:01.01]Swamp Witch.
[278:05.25]They say, thanks, I needed some voice lines for The Witch's Curse Part 4.
[278:11.31]Everyone can't wait to see that one.
[278:15.50]Where Fast Jerma and Purple Alien get into all kinds of trouble.
[278:22.76]Thank you, Bumblebuck.
[278:24.02]And thanks for the videos, too.
[278:27.16]Hey, Radchley.
[278:28.12]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[278:29.11]Hope you feel better.
[278:29.79]Glad you're taking the time you need to look after your health.
[278:32.25]Thank you for all the great streams.
[278:34.67]Thanks for the ten bucks.
[278:37.79]It was not an easy decision to make, but it's a decision I had to make.
[278:44.28]Thank you, Radchley.
[278:44.94]Appreciate it.
[278:46.88]We didn't watch part three.
[278:47.94]Don't worry.
[278:48.20]We're going to watch part three before we watch part four.
[278:53.23]Catboy, thanks for the 250.
[278:54.79]You said at the start this was going to be bad news.
[278:57.49]But we're all glad you can take some time off.
[279:00.52]Love from chat, especially offline chat.
[279:02.78]Come hang out with us in our secret hangout someday.
[279:05.64]Have a great next few weeks trying to figure out that stuff.
[279:08.14]Stay healthy, stay safe.
[279:09.08]Play Super Paper Mario.
[279:10.26]Take care of yourself and best wishes.
[279:13.24]Yeah.
[279:17.06]When are you going to do Sam and Max season 3?
[279:18.94]Never.
[279:19.12]Never.
[279:22.66]Well, bad news in the sense that the bad news was going to lead to good news.
[279:28.68]But bad as in I'm not going to be around.
[279:34.24]I hate taking extended time off.
[279:37.37]Because I genuinely enjoy doing this.
[279:39.39]I like having fun.
[279:42.47]I don't even know, guys.
[279:43.63]I might just fucking crack.
[279:45.39]You know what I mean?
[279:45.91]Like after two weeks, I might just crack and have to come play like Incredible Hulk or something.
[279:51.61]I don't know.
[279:57.62]Don't do it.
[279:58.72]I probably won't.
[279:59.62]But I won't.
[280:00.90]I won't.
[280:01.42]I'm not gonna.
[280:01.86]I'm not gonna.
[280:02.20]I'm not gonna.
[280:02.58]I'm not gonna.
[280:03.42]Only when I'm back to 100.
[280:04.50]You're right.
[280:04.80]Hey, Poncho Sansa.
[280:09.33]Thanks for the $5.
[280:10.25]Jerma, my wife and I are in our 30s.
[280:12.21]Just beginning cancer treatment for stage 2 colon cancer.
[280:15.35]So I know what you're going through.
[280:16.75]You're an amazing streamer and your streams mean a lot to us.
[280:18.89]Get well soon.
[280:25.04]I really hope
[280:27.29]That it's caught early.
[280:28.59]Enough.
[280:30.99]Sounds pretty... Potential positive.
[280:33.38]One thing about colon cancer is... If you catch it early enough... Within, I believe, the first... Stage or two, right?
[280:40.86]That it's very, very reversible.
[280:42.62]And... It can be treated.
[280:43.88]I wish you the absolute best.
[280:50.18]I can't imagine what you're going through.
[280:51.42]Stay fucking strong.
[281:02.76]Because what I'm going through is astronomically not even close to what you are.
[281:12.79]Thank you so much for the $5.
[281:13.67]I wish you the absolute best.
[281:25.09]Thank you to Siroc for the $2.50.
[281:27.21]Call Vinny, he's crying.
[281:31.69]Oh Vinny, he's crying.
[281:35.17]There was huge money.
[281:36.59]Holy shit.
[281:39.62]There was $100 and then $200.
[281:41.52]Oh my god.
[281:47.30]Thanks for the 10,000 bits.
[281:48.78]100 bucks.
[281:49.72]Dermot, please take all the time.
[281:50.76]You need to figure out what's going on.
[281:52.48]We'll be here when you get back.
[281:55.58]That's the plan.
[281:56.94]That's all they say.
[281:59.38]PaperIsFood gave 200 bucks.
[282:00.96]20,000 bits.
[282:01.77]200 fucking dollars.
[282:09.52]That's a ton of money.
[282:10.30]A year ago, I started animating my thesis film so I can graduate next week after four years with my BFA.
[282:16.15]Before I started production, I knew that I was going to need colorist plus music plus composition help, but I also realized that I would need to budget for the entertainment.
[282:25.91]So here's your payment for entertaining me for the 12 to 6 hour days while I animate my thesis since 2012.
[282:34.84]Helped me make it to the end and now I have a film about a strawberry ready for festivals.
[282:39.78]Stay healthy, Jerma.
[282:40.60]See you later.
[282:42.34]You're gonna have to fill us in on what this is.
[282:50.05]If you're still around, let us know what it is.
[282:52.51]I'm curious now.
[282:53.69]Watch this clip.
[283:03.73]And he wants to be friends with Jerma.
[283:07.92]It'll even fucking load.
[283:13.18]And... I always get really guilty about that.
[283:17.63]Because... Turn that off.
[283:20.91]Where's my audio?
[283:24.43]Like I said, every other stream.
[283:25.97]There we go.
[283:27.93]And...
[283:30.19]I always get really guilty about that because I like people.
[283:34.23]People like Jerma.
[283:35.15]Right.
[283:37.09]You know, like, for example, I wish I had a better friendship with him, but I don't put the effort in.
[283:44.66]And only Jerma.
[283:47.18]That's it.
[283:47.56]One guy.
[283:48.24]One guy.
[283:49.16]But, you know, and we all get busy.
[283:53.00]Everyone gets busy.
[283:54.06]But the point is, like, I got to.
[283:55.50]Yeah, I mean, that's.
[284:01.23]I feel that it's it's it's really really really easy to just kind of just do your own thing and do shit and not really reach out like I do that I do it all the time I know a lot of you guys know that I'm like I mostly do I'm a solo guy and I think vinny's the same way likes to do a lot of his stuff you know solo but you know you you can start to lose track
[284:39.14]I've hung out with Vinny in real life.
[284:42.11]He's a really... He's a great fucking person.
[284:44.07]He's a really good dude.
[284:47.97]He is like... He's exactly like how you think he is.
[284:51.73]You know what I mean?
[284:52.19]Just like the most chill dude.
[284:53.76]The most like just... He's exactly the way that you think he is.
[285:04.02]Is he taller than you?
[285:04.96]No, I've got at least two or three inches on him.
[285:08.21]He's probably like, he's like 5'11", I'm like fucking 6'2".
[285:11.79]You know how it is.
[285:23.84]Now, there's tons of people that I could say this about.
[285:25.70]You know, about hanging out with people, reaching out to people.
[285:28.92]You know, there's a lot of people that you end up talking to on a weekly, daily, monthly basis.
[285:38.21]I completely get it.
[285:44.13]Yearly.
[285:46.43]But that's another thing too that I think a lot of people need to understand is friendships are great and they work very well, especially when people don't feel like they're obligated to have to hang out with anybody.
[286:01.06]You know what I mean?
[286:04.73]It can make it a little bit more comfortable when it's not like, oh, I have to hang out with you because I have to.
[286:09.04]No, you want, you do, you want to, and you want to spend time with this person and you just do.
[286:24.70]Here comes the but.
[286:25.90]No.
[286:28.57]That was it.
[286:29.47]That was the statement.
[286:32.73]But, no.
[286:40.29]I have a lot of friends in random various places that I've met over the years and years and years.
[286:46.57]Some of them you don't talk to very much.
[286:47.82]Some of them you do.
[286:48.50]Some of them you spend a lot of time with.
[286:49.50]Some of you don't spend very much time with anymore.
[286:51.12]Some of you used to.
[286:51.84]Some of you do.
[286:52.42]Some maybe in the future.
[286:53.34]Oh, this friendship is now... You talk to this person every day.
[286:58.82]I don't.
[286:59.12]There's another person that you hang out with or another group of people.
[287:03.27]It's just kind of... It's kind of how life is.
[287:08.91]There are at least...
[287:11.03]There are probably at least a dozen people I can think of right now that are, maybe not that many, maybe like six that I will never stop talking to for my entire life.
[287:24.65]Those long-term just super friends that you just talk to almost every day.
[287:31.33]Name them.
[287:31.71]Most of them are people back in Massachusetts.
[287:35.17]They're lifelong childhood friends.
[287:38.52]that I end up talking to, I speak to, not every day, but, you know, at least once every, like, couple weeks, once a week.
[287:50.81]The Boston arc.
[287:56.95]But, yeah, I mean, I could probably list off on my 50 hands, right?
[288:01.92]But we're going to move on.
[288:08.90]We are going to move to the end of... Oh, my goodness, so much money.
[288:15.71]Oh, my God.
[288:17.39]It just updated.
[288:18.97]I had this, like, minimized down here, and I just moved it, and I didn't realize, holy shit, there's a ton of money.
[288:29.00]I wasn't looking at, like, the bar over the... Okay.
[288:34.32]Hey, expanded banana.
[288:35.48]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[288:37.44]Jeremiah, I graduated from high school this week, and I want to say thanks for helping me keep my sanity.
[288:42.33]Congratulations on high school completion.
[288:44.67]New book opens.
[288:46.13]Close that old one.
[288:49.23]Nice work.
[288:51.59]Phantom Tech, thanks for $5.
[288:52.59]Jeremiah, I want to say thanks for... I want to say thank you.
[288:56.47]That's what they messaged.
[288:57.01]I don't know what that meant.
[288:58.07]It's weird.
[288:59.69]No.
[288:59.93]They say thank you so much for making your content.
[289:03.40]When I was in senior year, I lost a lot of my friends because they graduated the previous year and went through a breakup that year, so I was feeling really useless, but started watching a lot of your videos to pass the time during lunch and it really helped.
[289:15.64]Hope you feel a lot better, man.
[289:16.58]Much love from a fan.
[289:21.76]Thank you, Phantom.
[289:25.67]I think that kind of goes into what we were just talking about.
[289:29.27]How sometimes the friends come and go.
[289:34.20]Some friends stay forever.
[289:39.22]Some people you're just really excited to see.
[289:41.88]Sometimes.
[289:47.46]I mean, there are people that I used to talk to, you know, in decades of time that, you know, I haven't spoken to in more than 10 years.
[289:55.73]And these are people that I spoke to on a daily basis.
[289:58.75]you know, 10, 20 years go by.
[290:00.29]It's like, I haven't spoken to that person.
[290:01.80]I probably couldn't, that person probably couldn't pick me out of a lineup.
[290:12.06]So I wouldn't think too hard on it.
[290:16.95]Really sorry to hear about the breakup though.
[290:19.07]It's never easy.
[290:21.81]I wish you the best.
[290:22.43]Thank you for the $5.
[290:26.13]Hey, rtx42069ti, thanks for the 250, about the props you used during the green screen.
[290:31.08]Did you steal it from someone?
[290:32.84]Or did you just buy it for this?
[290:34.90]Also, what do you do with all this stuff after the fact?
[290:37.00]Do you just stash it somewhere?
[290:38.91]Hope you're not one of those jerks who just buy something, use it once, and throw it away.
[290:42.55]Give it to us or donate it.
[290:44.33]That's exactly what happens.
[290:47.39]All the props used on the green screen, at least the ones that are not clothing-based, you know, ones like, for instance, some of the capes that don't make it very well, you know, some of those costumes that get ripped or get fucked up in the process that can't really be used again, everything is just donated.
[291:08.04]put nicely into a bunch of boxes and it is dropped off at a um center that takes them toys and models and figures and whatever it is yeah I purchased them and use them for the stream and then I just donate them and when I'm done go goodwill hunting for Jerm of props you probably could
[291:35.80]I'm talking across from Massachusetts to Las Vegas.
[291:40.89]I had a bunch of donations for toys and random games and stuff, and I wouldn't be surprised if somebody one day was just like, holy shit!
[291:52.41]Wait, is this the sword that he used?
[291:55.13]This is the sword from that green screen, right?
[291:57.88]Hold on a minute.
[292:01.02]I don't know.
[292:01.34]It could happen.
[292:02.84]Weirder things have happened.
[292:06.45]Hey Heavy Bolt, thanks for $5.
[292:07.77]Here's a couple of McChickens.
[292:08.83]Thank you.
[292:09.93]Now you don't need any of us to tell you this, but take as much time as you need.
[292:13.11]I thought about telling you how much your streams mean to me, but at this point it's all been said.
[292:16.60]And I can't decide what to say right now anyways.
[292:19.04]So just thanks for everything.
[292:22.68]Really appreciate that.
[292:23.34]That's... Means a shitload.
[292:30.73]It does.
[292:34.84]Because, like I said, I sometimes can't believe that somebody is even saying this about me.
[292:43.69]It's crazy for me to think about that.
[292:45.23]Because literally everything I've ever wanted to do is happening now.
[292:52.92]It's almost like you have to stop and look around for a little bit and be like, wait, this is happening.
[292:58.78]Remember that post on Newgrounds, Salty Swamp?
[293:02.29]You know how much back then I wanted to do the same shit?
[293:13.04]It's been something that I've cared about and just been a lifelong goal since I was a teenager and I can't fucking believe that I'm sitting here now and reading some of these comments.
[293:24.50]I just hope it can continue.
[293:25.68]I hope I can continue to be somebody that you think is funny.
[293:30.10]Or somebody that does entertaining things.
[293:33.78]Because if I'm not, then I'm doing something wrong.
[293:37.15]And I don't want that to happen.
[293:45.83]But thank you.
[293:48.00]Hey, Gooberry Juice, thanks for 250.
[293:49.54]Jerma, I just wanted to let you know there's absolutely no reason to apologize for taking the time off to need to fix your back pain.
[293:54.94]I'm just glad you're finally doing something about it.
[293:56.71]I remember I freaked out when I saw you breakdance, not just because it was pog, but because I knew how much it would hurt you to do it.
[294:03.65]The fact that you're sacrificing your body just to make us laugh is something that's both heartwarming and terrifying, so please enjoy your break.
[294:12.52]I do have to say, though, I mean, a lot of people that are writing about, oh, like, the fact that you sacrificed your body to do that, that's not what I was thinking.
[294:20.50]I just was sitting there and said, I'm going to breakdance now.
[294:22.82]That's what my brain told me to do.
[294:25.43]I wasn't going, like, here we go, here comes, like, the sacrifice.
[294:29.33]No, just, like, just do it.
[294:31.81]Hey, Jeremy, start breakdancing.
[294:33.29]Okay.
[294:34.33]That's all it took.
[294:37.89]His greatest sacrifice.
[294:40.49]What a hero.
[294:41.35]Oh, you broke dance.
[294:43.37]What a fucking hero.
[294:46.04]God.
[294:47.62]Sacrificial break dance.
[294:55.12]Sacrificial break dance.
[294:56.48]What a hero.
[294:59.71]That's going to make me laugh for a little while.
[295:03.65]Hey, Invaders, thanks for the 250.
[295:05.31]Gonna miss the streams, but I hope you got everything figured out with your health.
[295:08.67]Streams have helped me through a lot of stress recently.
[295:10.41]Thanks.
[295:12.15]Thanks for watching.
[295:17.81]Blueberry Juice, thanks for 250.
[295:19.13]Before you do that, can you do one last thing for me?
[295:22.25]I need to know who did this to you.
[295:25.26]Who did this to you?
[295:28.06]Watch for the vlog.
[295:28.76]3, 2, 1, go.
[295:33.60]Oh, the little... Who do you think that was?
[295:38.40]Do you really need to have more than one guess of who that is?
[295:40.28]Yeah, that was Star.
[295:47.42]Of course it was.
[295:48.86]Who else would do that?
[295:50.82]Who else would attack me?
[295:54.22]Who would physically attack me?
[296:01.08]It was Kit Fisto.
[296:04.14]Please show it.
[296:04.92]Okay, here, let's show it.
[296:13.36]We can see the exact moment here where I was attacked by Star.
[296:24.65]Watch for the vlog.
[296:25.37]3, 2, 1, go.
[296:25.77]Hey, guys.
[296:26.11]Wasn't him.
[296:34.15]It was... You can hear him laughing, yeah.
[296:44.73]He attacked me.
[296:46.01]He hit me.
[296:47.63]It was in the mouth of an object that could not have weighed more than like one ounce.
[296:55.64]It did incredible damage.
[297:02.47]It was kind of like putting my face on a pillow, but it was just, he attacked me!
[297:14.82]Is that what fucked up your nose?
[297:16.08]What do you mean fucked up your nose?
[297:17.50]Why are you saying I have a fucked up nose?
[297:20.36]I didn't tell you that.
[297:21.24]Where'd you, where are you getting that from?
[297:22.76]Is that where you fucked up your nose from?
[297:24.24]Where are you getting, oh, that's nice.
[297:26.68]Unbelievable.
[297:27.20]Alright, let's roll the credits.
[297:30.92]We still have bits to do, but the janitor in here.
[297:33.60]Is the janitor going to come in here?
[297:38.73]Sorry, I just, you know what I mean?
[297:47.12]Alright, so we have a shitload of subs are gonna fly by.
[297:50.98]They're going to go crazy.
[297:53.04]You're gonna see them.
[297:54.20]They're going to just explode.
[297:56.77]Are you ready?
[297:57.89]Here they come.
[297:59.27]It'll be very, very fast.
[298:01.39]Too fast.
[298:02.87]It's going so fast that you can't even see it.
[298:07.23]It's going so fast that you can't see it.
[298:18.57]That's... Why can't I... What's going on?
[298:27.20]Okay, now it works.
[298:28.54]What?
[298:30.50]Why did that happen?
[298:32.57]That's a lot of people.
[298:34.75]Screaming by the screen.
[298:37.73]Thanks for the subs.
[298:38.37]Thanks for the huge community subs.
[298:39.67]There was a bunch of you gave a lot of them.
[298:41.53]Thank you.
[298:42.23]It's insane.
[298:44.77]I can't believe this many people are subscribed and this many people are being given subscriptions.
[298:49.19]Just this list alone is too many.
[298:52.29]It's too many people.
[298:53.94]I can't believe it.
[298:56.10]Give subs, please, Jeremy.
[298:59.12]I know that guy.
[298:59.88]Hey, Niall Orion, thanks for $3.
[299:04.08]Jeremy, it's my friend James' birthday tomorrow.
[299:06.06]Can you please tell him happy birthday and that we love him?
[299:08.60]Hey, James.
[299:10.18]Happy birthday.
[299:10.94]From Niall Orion.
[299:12.48]And friends.
[299:14.76]I'm gonna miss you, you silly man.
[299:16.14]I'll be back, don't worry.
[299:18.53]Placidonius, thanks for the five dollars and one cent.
[299:21.51]Jerma, I got here too late for the proper explanation.
[299:24.59]But good luck.
[299:25.89]On the subject of the reanimated thing, there's been one in the works for Rat Movie for a bit.
[299:31.51]I think it'd be cool to see some other group could organize one for, like, Castle Griffin's Theater Jerma Rumble.
[299:36.21]Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
[299:37.73]But for real, though, stay safe and take care every Jeremy.
[299:43.44]Yeah, I've heard that floating around.
[299:44.92]About the rap movie.
[299:46.08]There's going to be like an animated kind of system like that.
[299:51.86]Jerma Rumble will take forever.
[299:54.16]Yeah, Jerma Rumble on its own is like an hour.
[299:57.70]That would be... Well, no.
[299:59.86]It doesn't matter how long the video is.
[300:01.79]That doesn't mean anything.
[300:06.57]Figuring these out now.
[300:09.22]Jerma Rumble is 20 minutes.
[300:10.14]Jerma Rumble Live is 47 minutes long, isn't it?
[300:12.80]46 minutes?
[300:13.58]It's a long one.
[300:17.41]We'll see.
[300:19.03]There are other projects that are going to take precedence first.
[300:23.07]You will see them before that happens.
[300:25.41]Nothing wrong with my kidneys.
[300:26.63]I had those checked already.
[300:27.39]Thanks for the $4.20.
[300:49.78]Kiari, thanks for the $5.
[300:51.04]Jeremy, I appreciate the auto-host.
[300:52.46]If you could please figure out a way to do Twitch reruns, maybe every other day during the break.
[300:56.76]I'd love to watch a VOD with a fresh chat on the channel.
[301:00.56]The Overwatch League did them back in the day, but I don't know if it's still a feature.
[301:03.40]I don't think, no.
[301:04.18]I think they deleted it.
[301:07.99]I don't think you can do reruns anymore, right?
[301:09.47]Didn't they delete it?
[301:16.01]You can.
[301:16.53]Oh.
[301:17.41]See if you can.
[301:19.38]Um, I don't know.
[301:20.26]I don't know.
[301:21.68]I don't know.
[301:22.04]I don't know if I want to do that.
[301:23.52]I'm not sure I'm into that whole thing.
[301:26.72]Maybe I could pick, like, one of my top two favorite streams or something.
[301:32.99]Maybe one of my top favorite streams and restream them.
[301:38.07]It's going to be the Birdhouse stream, isn't it?
[301:39.47]No.
[301:41.33]Let me, let's, that's not going to happen immediately.
[301:43.97]Let me think about if I want to do that or not.
[301:48.02]That's going to take a long time for me to figure out which one it is.
[301:50.71]There's too many.
[301:52.53]No, this ain't happening.
[301:55.07]This is not going to happen.
[301:55.77]It's going to take too long.
[301:57.87]It's going to take too long for me to figure out which one it is.
[301:59.63]I'll sit there for three days trying to figure that out.
[302:03.09]My phone will be blowing up.
[302:04.69]The doctor will be like, what are you doing?
[302:06.07]Get down there for your exam.
[302:08.17]Sorry, I'm just trying to figure out which one of my streams is the best.
[302:13.22]I've watched them all four times.
[302:16.44]It's an interesting thought, though.
[302:17.94]I might do it.
[302:18.88]Don't hold me to that.
[302:22.94]Thanks for the $5.
[302:23.72]Hey, ControlX, thanks for $2.50.
[302:25.28]Jerma, it's a pleasure to watch your stream, as always.
[302:27.92]If what I've been seeing is not even 1% of your power, I can't imagine what 100% is like.
[302:32.74]Can't wait for you to ch-ch-ch-ch-charge up Pogface.
[302:35.74]Bernie Pog.
[302:37.96]Well, it was way more than 1%.
[302:40.44]It was about 70% of my power.
[302:43.46]What can I do with the extra 30%?
[302:46.45]Imagine if we could unlock the other 10%.
[302:49.49]Imagine if we could unlock even 11% of our brain power.
[302:52.93]Like that movie where it happens.
[302:54.15]People could control shit with their brains.
[302:56.61]We'll see what I can do.
[303:02.22]Hey, RyuBait.
[303:03.46]Thanks for the 100 bucks.
[303:04.74]100 dollars for the 100% man.
[303:12.18]Thank you.
[303:12.50]That's an insane amount of money.
[303:15.78]Hey, nv11casting, thanks for 250.
[303:18.48]So I gotta be a little sappy for a bit.
[303:20.16]Sorry, here it goes.
[303:22.50]Having to go back into my home situation because of this pandemic nearly sent me back into a real bad depression.
[303:27.88]But your streams helped keep me feeling semi-okay.
[303:31.56]Take as much time as you need, we're all rooting for you.
[303:38.29]Yeah, the pandemic has really fucked up a lot of people's lives.
[303:44.41]put people into situations they shouldn't be in.
[303:48.40]Taking people out of situations that they really wanted to be in.
[303:53.84]It's not good.
[304:01.36]But we have some encouraging data that hopefully...
[304:08.15]Over these next couple months.
[304:10.65]Somewhere into July.
[304:12.09]That we can really start to be on the down.
[304:15.67]It's just the downtrend.
[304:18.46]And we try to go back to fucking normal.
[304:21.36]As much as we can.
[304:28.07]I would love to see it.
[304:37.48]Because out here in Nevada, the stay-at-home order is still here.
[304:45.16]And it's going to stay.
[304:47.08]We're doing this whole phased thing where if a couple weeks go by and there's no spike in cases, then we're going to slowly go into another phase.
[304:56.12]But from everything I've read about this, this shit's not going to go away.
[305:03.14]It's just here.
[305:05.46]And I don't think we're gonna, this might be a situation where this is something that we have to deal with for a long time.
[305:12.10]People say the word second phase, but I'm not even sure, I don't even know if I believe that.
[305:17.96]Because I think it's just here.
[305:20.54]And I'm not even sure if this is a second phase.
[305:23.10]What about just first phase that never leaves?
[305:28.07]Until obviously like a vaccine, right?
[305:32.23]Phase five.
[305:39.06]second spike is more accurate yeah I'm not a doctor I'm not a scientist I'm just gonna wait that it's out of my it's out of my court for this I'm an e-clown that dances to jojo's bizarre adventure I don't know anything about medicine I'm just gonna listen to the people that do know about medicine and know how to run and that's what I I just danced at jojo's bizarre adventure in front of a green screen that's what I do
[306:10.18]And let's hope they can figure it out.
[306:11.52]Because this is an unprecedented thing.
[306:16.12]And sure, there's a lot of, well, we have, like, we've been, we've potentially been running through these, like, simulated pandemics.
[306:22.25]And we have some idea of what might happen and what might not happen.
[306:25.17]Who fucking knows?
[306:27.25]This is the first time this has really ever caused this much of a problem, at least in the United States.
[306:33.09]Can we ban Sour Please?
[306:39.22]Why?
[306:39.44]Why?
[306:47.40]What about the Spanish flu?
[306:50.30]Well, when I say that, what I'm talking about is, like, Disney World closed.
[306:55.48]For more than a week.
[306:57.66]That shit ain't never happened, ever.
[307:01.33]Uh, I know, like, Spanish, I'm talking about, like, in, like, kind of modern times.
[307:08.09]They didn't have Disney World in 1918.
[307:09.25]Yeah, well, we got it now.
[307:13.21]If they had a Disney World, you bet your ass it would've been closed.
[307:27.88]century Mickey Mouse Spanish flu is modern times No, when your TV could push through colors is where modern times starts Why?
[307:48.17]Because that's the best invention since fucking the steam engine color TV
[307:58.91]this is the type of shit that if I was like a real personality making these statements like on like a real show there'd be like an article written about me tomorrow about like how fucking fucked up I was thank god I'm not a real personality too late
[308:24.15]Breaking news streamer says that color TV was most important invention Next to the steam engine Listen to this.
[308:35.29]Here's this clip it was it probably was No, you know what the best invention in the world was glass Think about that glass who invented glass when was the first glass pane pressed I
[308:56.99]history of glass history of glass dates dates back to at least 3600 BC in Mesopotamia it's a long time ago well that guy was rich
[309:21.51]Anyways, let's finish these bits up.

[309:41.96]Anyways, I graduated recently with a bachelor's in computer science.

[309:50.65]Thank you.
[309:51.83]Hope this donation helps you in some way.
[309:53.61]Good night and good luck.
[309:58.71]I will have an answer.
[309:59.39]And I hope it's an easy one.
[310:03.92]I hope it's just a simple thing that I can just do and be done with it.
[310:08.40]It's the best case scenario.
[310:10.90]Thanks for the three bucks.
[310:12.90]VibioGame, thanks for five dollars.

[310:29.25]See who's around.
[310:30.87]I'll hop in the Discord for a little while.
[310:32.33]In the general.
[310:33.23]I'll be around.
[310:37.45]RTM, thanks for $5.
[310:38.29]Jerma, that green screen stream was great.
[310:40.48]I still can't believe you broke dance on stream.
[310:42.22]That was a genuine pug.
[310:44.16]Hope you feel better soon.
[310:44.94]Take all the goddamn time you need.
[310:49.60]So much fucking support.
[310:50.96]Like, I... I can't even believe it.
[310:56.76]Thanks, guys.
[311:02.76]But I'm gonna be just fine.
[311:08.46]They're right.
[311:09.12]Yeah, I know they are.
[311:12.17]And I am gonna do that.
[311:14.78]Grown man's gonna cry.
[311:16.34]I'm not gonna cry.
[311:19.75]Grown man cry.
[311:22.05]Iron Chef Italian.
[311:23.51]That's a great name.
[311:25.47]Thanks for the $5.
[311:25.79]Uh, well...
[311:43.39]There are a lot of clubs that do condensed games.
[311:50.63]Some of the subscription services you can get cut out all the bullshit.
[311:55.92]And you can watch a full game in like an hour and 25 minutes.
[312:00.02]Hour.
[312:02.18]That's been the problem with baseball for forever is some of the games are four hours long.
[312:06.32]It's three hours and 10 minutes.
[312:07.70]We're in the seventh inning.
[312:11.23]So if you really don't want to go through every single pitch, I know that you can watch condensed games.
[312:17.14]I would just type in your favorite team.
[312:19.24]Oh, the subscription service with condensed games.
[312:23.40]I know you can't watch it live like that, but they usually go up immediately after the game is over.
[312:31.56]Baseball.
[312:32.66]ResidentSleeper.
[312:34.92]Yeah, well, I'm answering his question.
[312:36.40]You didn't ask it.
[312:39.96]Come on, you didn't ask it, he did.
[312:45.98]TB Chamber, $50, 5,000 bits, a lot of money.
[312:50.24]Hey man, hope you get this thing smashed.
[312:52.94]Much love.
[312:53.54]P.S.
[312:53.78]I'm working on a game with the green screen assets.
[312:55.52]Would this be okay for community content night?
[312:57.38]Absolutely.
[312:58.28]Of course it would.
[313:00.92]We've done a couple of those before.
[313:03.26]On the first green screen night, we played a game or two.
[313:07.38]Yeah, definitely.
[313:09.96]Thanks for the huge amount of money.
[313:12.76]Apple Shift, thanks for 250.
[313:13.72]I'm so glad you're getting things figured out, man.
[313:16.02]Take your time.
[313:16.50]I know that we'll be right here waiting for you when you get back.
[313:20.29]You're an incredible person and we're gonna miss you a ton.
[313:22.59]Thanks for making us happy and being the best E-clon.
[313:26.05]All I gotta say to that is... Thank you.
[313:31.12]I should have one of those.
[313:31.96]I just put it on and squeeze it sometimes.
[313:37.42]Ultra Vires, thanks for the 300 bits.
[313:39.50]Jeremy, my mother had to go to the hospital a couple weeks back and in the middle of a deadlines for university that week and it was the world of stress.
[313:46.74]All your videos and streams, whether it be during work breaks or when I simply didn't have the will to work was a massive light of hope during the darkness.
[313:54.43]It's been great watching you over the past weeks and finally subscribing.
[313:58.55]Thank you for that.
[314:00.13]Take all the time you need now and come back as 100.
[314:02.21]You don't owe us anything.
[314:04.93]You don't owe me anything either.
[314:09.01]You know, that goes both ways.
[314:12.85]You don't owe me anything.
[314:17.09]So... On a monetary sense, we go back there.
[314:23.51]You don't have to do anything.
[314:24.73]You don't owe me anything.
[314:28.71]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[314:30.49]Sorry to hear about your mother.
[314:33.13]Hopefully she's okay.
[314:39.35]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[314:43.15]Colin Halter, thanks for the 300 bits.
[314:45.35]Take all the time you need, Jeremy.
[314:46.41]We've got years of backlog content to keep us going.
[314:49.81]Kick that nerves ass and come back brand new, champ.
[314:52.77]I'm looking forward to it.
[314:57.88]Jacobin, thanks for the 1,000 bits.
[314:59.20]Jeremy, there's a practice that's called neurokinetic therapy.
[315:03.96]supposed to help your body it unhooks muscle tension is the short way I can explain it it sounds fishy but I've seen it work it may help you I I am I'm willing to try pretty much anything but we I do have a positive result for potential potential maybe I maybe
[315:29.62]Remember, this is not a diagnosis.
[315:31.32]I don't know.
[315:32.74]But rheumatoid arthritis.
[315:36.28]My rheumatoid factor was high.
[315:39.60]Which apparently can explain a few different conditions that can cause that.
[315:43.12]RA is one of them.
[315:46.66]That was the last thing that happened.
[315:48.28]And the next thing to say, alright, let's get this taken care of.
[315:51.83]Let's get this figured out.
[315:57.96]But yeah, I looked into acupuncture and massage therapy.
[316:03.41]I went to physical therapy.
[316:04.79]I was told of physical therapy.
[316:05.97]This might not even help.
[316:07.95]So I'm willing to try pretty much anything.
[316:13.31]I will actually write that down.
[316:14.61]You can take a look.
[316:18.47]Neurokinetic therapy.
[316:20.05]Let's just put it in there.
[316:24.98]Thanks for the tip.
[316:27.50]Hey, my name, bro.
[316:28.52]Thanks for $5.
[316:31.08]I had a similar invasive procedure done when I had pain in my back a few years ago.
[316:35.12]They shot some steroids in there.
[316:36.64]Not a way you want to spend a Wednesday, but on the whole, not so bad.
[316:40.18]Get well.
[316:40.66]That's what the first doctor wanted to do.
[316:46.64]And I was about to book the procedure.
[316:50.45]Then I had another doctor that said, wait, don't do that yet.
[316:54.01]It might not be that.
[316:55.69]And I'm like, I don't know, maybe it is not that.
[316:57.55]Okay?
[316:59.03]If it is, I'm going to do it.
[316:59.81]If it isn't, then I'm not going to do it.
[317:03.99]But it does work for a lot of people, from what I've read.
[317:06.18]From what I've been told.
[317:08.58]If I have to do it, I'm going to do it.
[317:12.00]Swiggity Swanky, thanks for $5.
[317:13.26]This stream has really helped me.
[317:14.25]I was in a dark place today.
[317:16.05]Both from overwork and stress from my demanding boss.
[317:19.17]But that Kit Fisto moment has literally cured me of that stress.
[317:23.23]Take care of yourself first.
[317:25.01]Please understand that you make a difference and I'm lucky to have known you.
[317:27.99]Kit Fisto.
[317:29.24]Like, slow.
[317:31.10]I don't care if it's a meme.
[317:32.64]It was funny.
[317:40.10]Thank you for the $5, Swiggity Swanky.
[317:42.87]It was a great, it was a great moment, it was a great video.
[317:44.97]I hope you get a diagnosis soon, and everything, and getting everything all worked out before the better.
[318:15.18]Holy shit, that's rare.
[318:18.38]Yeah, that's the thing about illnesses and diseases.
[318:22.18]There's just so many different conditions that you could have if you have a problem.
[318:29.67]If you get, like, for instance, when I first went in for this problem, I had a blood test.
[318:34.73]Oh, your red counts fine.
[318:35.61]Your white counts fine.
[318:37.43]Your kidneys are fine.
[318:38.45]Your liver functions, it looks perfect to me.
[318:40.49]Your cholesterol is a little bit high, but nothing to be afraid of.
[318:45.77]Okay, now what?
[318:48.59]And then you start to, it's not one of those immediate things that people can just immediately find out and know.
[318:54.68]Then you go down the rabbit hole where it's like, okay, so if my blood work is fine and I don't have like a tumor or something, let's spin the wheel of what the hell is your disease?
[319:10.04]And I feel like I've been in that revolving door for two years.
[319:13.38]Trying to figure it out.
[319:14.86]Can you please say penis, penis?
[319:17.66]Thank you.
[319:24.97]But, SergioButt, thanks for the $2.50.
[319:26.17]I hope I get one soon, too.
[319:32.53]GayWizard, thanks for the three bucks.
[319:35.07]RagoDeathKnight, thanks for the five dollars.
[319:36.97]HeyMan, good luck with everything.
[319:37.89]Hope everything goes smoothly.
[319:39.65]Thank you.
[319:42.27]One Blondie, thanks for $5.
[319:43.85]Jerma985, I think you are cool and you're my favorite streamer.
[319:47.30]I hope you have a good night.
[319:49.46]Just shortened to the point.
[319:51.12]That's very just... Thank you.
[319:55.66]Harry, thanks for the $6, Harry41.
[319:57.94]Hey, better soon, my man.
[320:00.82]Let's go to the Emergency Robocop Body Fund.
[320:05.48]Thank you.
[320:07.17]Thank all of you.
[320:10.85]Spiritual Hog, thanks for 300 bits.
[320:12.73]Because you liked Gacha Force, you should check out Custom Robo for the GameCube.
[320:16.15]Look at me.
[320:16.97]It's right behind me.
[320:18.87]I own it, and I'm going to be ready to play it when I come back.
[320:21.82]Eventually.
[320:24.94]I've heard it's very fun.
[320:30.22]Hey, Wembley TTV, thanks for the $2.50.
[320:32.32]Watching Salty Swamp on Newgrounds, even if you sound younger, you have not changed at all with your humor.
[320:38.81]I'm sure I have.
[320:41.64]I'm sure I've matured a little.
[320:44.98]You know, I was actually talking to Kim about this.
[320:48.94]You don't really feel like an adult.
[320:51.29]Or feel like you've grown up at all.
[320:53.57]Until... Until you say a certain phrase out loud.
[320:59.79]Or you do a certain thing that you just go, I can't believe, what the fuck did that person say?
[321:03.74]That's unbelievable.
[321:05.20]Wait, when I was like 17, 18, 19, I probably would have thought that was funny.
[321:10.68]No, I wouldn't have.
[321:11.30]Not me.
[321:12.38]Not me.
[321:13.51]I'm perfect.
[321:15.79]I'm sure I've, you know, everybody grows up.
[321:18.59]Everybody, you know, grows up a little bit through their teens into their 20s.
[321:22.97]I like to hope I've become a more mature person in the last 20 years.
[321:27.94]But I don't, I do agree with you though.
[321:30.42]I don't think that I've, I don't think I've changed my approach.
[321:35.82]I think that's still, that's stayed pretty much the same.
[321:45.54]Have you tried going 2,000 years into the future in search of a cure?
[321:48.44]2,000... That's a lot.
[321:54.26]Um... How about, like, 50?
[321:56.73]100 years?
[321:58.37]2,000 years.
[321:58.59]I don't know if I want to step out of the time machine.
[322:03.95]The ground might be made out of liquid by then.
[322:06.87]I'm not sure I want to do that.
[322:11.70]There might be a new animal that has eaten us all.
[322:16.41]Well, I'm not doing that.
[322:18.09]I'm going tops 10 years in the future.
[322:21.41]You go 10 years at a time.
[322:23.32]Don't go right to 2,000.
[322:24.20]Are you out of your mind?
[322:26.42]Just go 5 years.
[322:28.27]Take a look around.
[322:29.49]Go order a hot dog.
[322:30.97]Walk around some streets.
[322:32.21]Is it normal?
[322:33.49]Okay, take a look at what companies have.
[322:36.63]Is there any new medical things or any new human advancements?
[322:40.48]Okay, this is pretty normal.
[322:41.66]Another five years.
[322:42.68]Do it again.
[322:43.34]Another five.
[322:44.36]Once you start to see shit really fucking hit the fan, I'm assuming it's probably going to be somewhere around the one to two to three hundred year mark.
[322:52.94]That's when you start to go backwards and then start to tell people how they can fix some of those issues.
[322:59.61]Like right now.
[323:00.49]Like right now.
[323:01.27]Like now, now, now.
[323:02.71]No, not... Alright, well, we don't know that yet.
[323:08.85]You don't know that.
[323:10.15]They won't listen.
[323:11.07]They will.
[323:12.49]If you can prove to them that you've seen it.
[323:16.20]All you gotta do is just say... Like, I don't know.
[323:20.14]You could prove that you're from the future a million ways.
[323:25.10]Just find the hot, new, insane TV show.
[323:29.93]That everybody's watching.
[323:31.13]Like a Game of Thrones.
[323:31.95]A cultural fucking phenomenon that millions of people care about.
[323:36.06]And then watch the series finale.
[323:40.24]Well, I mean, don't watch the Game of Thrones series.
[323:43.14]I'm not Game of Thrones.
[323:44.14]I mean, I poopoo that one.
[323:46.09]It's not very good.
[323:48.39]You know, watch the series finale.
[323:51.59]Memorize the whole thing.
[323:53.94]Memorize the entire episode.
[323:55.90]It might take you like a couple of months of really, really getting everybody's lines.
[323:59.95]Okay?
[324:03.91]Then, during the airing of the show, walk around and just say every single line out loud.
[324:13.98]And be like, and pointing at yourself like, see?
[324:16.76]See?
[324:24.27]No, not spoil it.
[324:25.51]I'm saying I'm saying like You're gonna get sued by the studio Just get it on a flash drive Just think you stole the script
[324:50.06]What was the name of that TV show where the guy got the next day's newspaper in the mail every day?
[324:57.30]What a cool show.
[324:58.50]Like, that's such an interesting show.
[325:00.12]What was it called?
[325:02.00]It was a TV show that ran for a little while.
[325:04.57]It was called Early Edition.
[325:06.51]This guy woke up every day, and at his doorstep, the next day's paper was put in the morning on his doorstep.
[325:17.51]And he had to figure out what the hell he was going to do.
[325:19.29]Like, what happened?
[325:20.05]What happened tomorrow that I could maybe fix?
[325:26.00]What a great idea for a show.
[325:31.64]Thank you for saying penis for me.
[325:33.15]Penis.
[325:33.49]You get it twice.
[325:34.63]See?
[325:34.99]I'm a man of the people.
[325:36.65]Mod that guy.
[325:37.15]I don't actually do that, though.
[325:40.39]I don't know who that is.
[325:46.67]Hey, Vilemi, thanks for the $5.
[325:48.37]Wait, hold up.
[325:48.93]You hate anime?
[325:50.35]I can't believe I have to cancel you, Jeremy.
[325:51.93]I don't even... I don't fucking hate anime.
[325:59.32]I watch it.
[326:01.42]I watch it.
[326:02.72]I watch maybe one a year or two a year.
[326:04.84]I watch it.
[326:07.02]I don't, like, love it, but I don't... Why would I... I watch it.
[326:10.61]I think I've...
[326:12.59]Watch it.
[326:13.66]Oh, you like... Oh, you do like anime.
[326:15.18]Okay, fine.
[326:15.66]Then name them all.
[326:16.50]Is that what you just said?
[326:17.26]Okay, fine.
[326:18.14]I'll do... I don't know if I can...
[326:25.20]I could have pulled this from memory.
[326:26.36]You wanted an alphabetical order?
[326:27.50]Um... I don't know if I could do that.
[326:31.14]I didn't think of my... A bridge to the starry skies.
[326:34.21]A centaur's life.
[326:35.23]A certain magical index.
[326:36.17]A certain scientific accelerator.
[326:37.41]A certain scientific railgun.
[326:38.47]A dark rabbit.
[326:39.01]A seven lives.
[326:39.51]A destructive god.
[326:40.19]Six next to me.
[326:41.34]A lull in the sea.
[326:42.26]A place further than the universe.
[326:43.24]A sister is all you need.
[326:43.94]A talk to titan.
[326:45.86]Is that a real thing?
[326:46.88]I feel like that's a really secure password.
[327:11.70]Right?
[327:12.36]That's... Active raid.
[327:14.19]Actually, I am.
[327:15.01]Wait, okay.
[327:16.19]The jig is up here.
[327:28.26]Dude, he's got anime knowledge.
[327:29.60]Alright, let's get out of here.
[327:33.64]Any Nep subs here?
[327:34.98]Smug.
[327:36.09]This stream made me laugh harder than I have this whole summer.
[327:38.17]Hope you feel better and don't come back till you're 100.
[327:40.75]I won't.
[327:41.47]I can promise you that.
[327:43.90]Hey, Ranger.
[327:45.28]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[327:46.94]I love your work.
[327:47.62]Your vids and streams kept me entertained from the start of high school until now.
[327:50.46]I'm a junior in college.
[327:52.12]You kept me going mentally when I was diagnosed with Crohn's almost exactly a year ago.
[327:56.24]Knowing you struggled with similar things and made it out stronger helped me regain focus.
[328:01.01]I'm moving into the work world soon, so I don't know if I'll be able to keep up with the streams ever.
[328:05.65]Probably will have to stick to highlights.
[328:08.32]Truly, thanks so much.
[328:14.23]Crohn's is in the same kind of family as colitis, and this colitis, proctitis, Crohn's, they're all in that irritable bowel disease.
[328:23.45]So, I know what that's like.
[328:29.28]Thankfully, mine's become completely under control.
[328:31.92]Took me a little while, though.
[328:32.90]It did take a while.
[328:35.49]I had random issues with colitis bullshit for years.
[328:41.93]But the one thing that I can tell you is eventually I figured it out, I got on the right treatment plan, and it is completely under control.
[328:53.54]Completely.
[328:55.48]It just took a little while.
[328:56.88]Longer than I may have wanted, but it's done now.
[329:01.72]If you type your password, it shows as an asterisk.
[329:03.94]Look.
[329:04.36]Wait, what?
[329:13.90]Does that work?
[329:18.42]Oh, shit.
[329:19.00]The fuck?
[329:20.66]Don't fucking... Whatever.
[329:25.90]The fuck?
[329:28.00]Fucking idiot.
[329:29.90]Fucking idiot.
[329:32.70]Hey, Alecule.
[329:34.56]Thanks for the $5.
[329:35.04]I hope you feel well and get better.
[329:36.89]Rip to Simon.
[329:40.39]My old dog.
[329:43.99]That was my old dachshund.
[329:46.51]Years past.
[329:51.01]Thank you so much for the $5.
[329:51.69]Hey, EdgeWVVV, thanks for the $5.
[330:00.70]Jerma, I'm comfortable giving you this money.
[330:02.20]Turn on smart clicks.
[330:03.18]Thank you.
[330:03.52]I don't even have it installed.
[330:05.32]I uninstalled it.
[330:06.44]Not even possible.
[330:07.04]I'm sorry.
[330:07.38]Hey, SpectralPants, thanks for $5.
[330:10.56]Been watching a long time.
[330:12.40]But you never really gave support like this.
[330:14.54]Take care of yourself, Jeremy.
[330:16.12]You've been my favorite streamer since I started watching.
[330:17.94]And I've been watching since before Twitch.
[330:21.02]Thanks for your stuffs.
[330:22.70]I know the future will be better.
[330:24.70]Peace.
[330:27.16]Peace.
[330:28.88]To you as well.
[330:33.82]I just wanted to say anything to you, because I'm getting kind of emotional here.
[330:40.13]I've never been that active in the community.
[330:41.89]I don't have time to watch every video.
[330:43.49]I wish I could participate more, but I just have a lot of things going on in life right now, at all times.
[330:47.87]Completely understandable.
[330:50.40]This stream is here solely for entertainment.
[330:55.60]It's for you to have something to watch.
[330:58.52]It's for you to enjoy.
[331:01.63]not obligated to be here ever so don't worry but I've watched you for years your kung fu chroma key had me in stitches and I've loved your stuff ever since you always make me smile without fail whether I'm catching a stream or watching highlights thanks for everything thank you rock esper thanks for being part of this community that has grown exponentially over the last three or four years
[331:29.79]Twitch predominantly, thank you Subbies, oh, that's an old one That's all that's about for you.
[331:39.40]That's a four-year-old reference right there.
[331:42.50]I know what that is Hey ginko ginko.
[331:45.70]Thanks for the four dollars crit chance.
[331:47.82]Thanks for five dollars.
[331:49.84]Oh God that guy convinced me.
[331:51.02]I can't stop myself
[331:54.10]Well, thanks for the $5.
[331:55.62]Sculprit, thanks for $10.
[331:56.97]Jeremy, this is going a while back, but I wanted you to know when you first uploaded your Firewatch photos video, I fell asleep watching it.
[332:03.75]So for a solid week, I genuinely thought it was a weird fever dream that I had.
[332:07.41]It was.
[332:09.55]I don't know.
[332:10.64]What video are you talking about?
[332:12.72]Firewatch?
[332:13.54]Like that game?
[332:14.12]The game where you walk around and open up boxes and stuff?
[332:19.58]I've never played it.
[332:21.92]What a dream, though, man.
[332:23.58]Hey, NullDev, thanks for $4.
[332:25.06]Love watching your full streams while doing homework.
[332:26.74]Just giving back to the best streamer.
[332:27.86]Get well soon.
[332:31.89]I'm honored to be your favorite streamer.
[332:35.61]I gotta keep that title, though.
[332:37.17]That's what you guys don't understand.
[332:40.35]You can't just become somebody's favorite streamer.
[332:42.81]And then that's it.
[332:43.36]Okay, I did it.
[332:44.12]I'm done.
[332:47.16]I want to continue to defend the favorite streamer championship.
[332:54.06]I'm going to do whatever I can.
[332:56.20]Try to defend that title.
[332:59.52]See if I'm successful.
[333:03.70]Game flip.
[333:04.34]Thanks for $5.
[333:05.18]Hey man, today would have been the last day of my senior year.
[333:08.22]I spent it sitting at home playing Half-Life Alyx custom maps.
[333:10.80]That sounds really fun.
[333:11.80]Just want to say that I've been watching you for almost six years.
[333:15.38]I just want to say thank you for all the laughs and all the memes for the past six years and to take care of yourself.
[333:22.78]Thank you.
[333:23.96]That sounds like a lot of fun.
[333:25.68]Half-Life Alyx custom maps.
[333:27.64]I feel like I know what that is, but I don't.
[333:34.47]Alakool, thanks for $5.
[333:35.63]Here's some more bits for your health.
[333:36.93]I like to listen to your streams while playing Dark Souls, but sometimes I laugh, which gets me killed.
[333:40.53]Make sure you don't die to Pinwheel.
[333:44.89]Everybody here doesn't like that.
[333:49.14]And then you can just blame it on me.
[333:50.12]So then I died to Pinwheel because you died because of me while you were at Pinwheel.
[333:55.10]Just blame it on me.
[333:55.88]I'll take the blame.
[333:58.52]NeonCZD, thanks for 300 bits.
[334:00.37]Hey, Jerma, thanks for always providing great content for all of us.
[334:03.39]See you when you get back.
[334:06.33]Thank you.
[334:08.59]StixRenegade250.
[334:11.61]What was your treatment for IBD?
[334:13.50]I have Crohn's and had a bad flare up a year and a half ago.
[334:15.98]It's in remission now, but in case it flares up again...
[334:20.09]I was put on a... It's going to be potentially TMI for a lot of people, but whatever.
[334:27.76]We're talking medicine.
[334:29.12]This is medical.
[334:30.86]I was put on... Look, listen.
[334:33.54]If you don't... Look, if you can't accept me at my worst, then... I'm trying to think of something else besides obey your thirst.
[334:48.88]I was thinking about, like, go listen to Fred Durst.
[334:52.12]Like, I've listened to Fred Durst's music before.
[334:54.39]I'm a fan of his old songs.
[335:01.45]And so that wouldn't be accurate.
[335:02.95]Anyways, I was prescribed a thing that goes the other way.
[335:07.29]It doesn't go down.
[335:09.72]It goes up.
[335:14.39]Oh, yes.
[335:15.61]Okay.
[335:16.97]And I did that for a while.
[335:19.10]And I was on it for about two or three weeks.
[335:21.58]And it just, it absolutely destroyed it.
[335:24.82]And sometimes if I have a flare up, which happens from time to time, I go on a stint of this exact medication.
[335:31.85]Because where I have all my problems is localized in the lower end of my colon.
[335:38.87]So, there's a reach.
[335:45.00]Talking about suppositories.
[335:46.29]Thank you.
[335:46.77]Somebody was going to say it.
[335:51.49]But I took a oral prescription for a long time.
[335:57.94]It was a pill that I had to take like seven or eight of them a day.
[336:01.94]And it didn't do anything.
[336:03.91]So we finally tried to treat from the other way, and it worked perfectly.
[336:10.29]But also, the condition I have might not be in the same spot that you have it.
[336:16.53]I was able to do it well with the other way because of where it sits, the disease in the colon.
[336:25.05]So I was fortunate that I was able to do it that way.
[336:29.59]There you go.
[336:31.03]Look, I'm a transparent guy.
[336:34.63]What do you want me to say?
[336:36.01]This is real life.
[336:36.73]They say this is real life, right?
[336:38.21]This is reality.
[336:42.92]We're talking reality, and that's what we're talking.
[336:46.64]It's all fun and games.
[336:48.68]Until you go to reality.
[336:51.52]No, but that's not bad.
[336:53.34]No, no, no.
[336:53.72]It's all fun and games, usually, but sometimes we're in reality and we talk about real stuff.
[336:58.86]There you go.
[336:59.20]That's a better way to put that.
[337:03.54]Hey Milkestant.
[337:05.16]Milkestant, thanks for the thousand bits.
[337:07.03]$10.50 to be exact.
[337:07.97]More than $10.
[337:08.23]Thank you.
[337:08.63]Feel better soon.
[337:12.47]When you get back, I've got some awesome news to share about my life.
[337:18.41]I hope I got some good news to share with you too.
[337:21.10]We'll go back and forth.
[337:22.88]With our good shit.
[337:25.44]Looking forward to it.
[337:26.90]It's a cliffhanger.
[337:29.92]Hey ShittyViewbot, thanks for... Look at all this money.
[337:33.46]This has been an insane amount of money.
[337:34.78]Thank you, ShittyViewButt, for the $5.
[337:36.46]Take all the time you need.
[337:37.12]I think you're making the right choice here.
[337:38.48]Maybe this health issue is just something small, like bad gas.
[337:46.32]You made me laugh.
[337:47.26]You did it.
[337:48.68]Bingo, Sunshine.
[337:49.46]Thanks for the $5.
[337:50.28]Glad you're finally getting this shit sorted.
[337:53.21]Yeah.
[337:56.33]You too.
[337:58.45]Thanks for the 250.
[337:59.33]Hope you feel better, Jerma.
[338:00.21]I'm more of a recent fan, but you've already made such a positive impact.
[338:03.53]Your streams always make me happy.
[338:04.91]And this community is basically the only place online where I felt welcomed from the start.
[338:09.49]Thanks for being you.
[338:10.27]Love you.
[338:10.73]And post-stream!
[338:13.73]You gotta love the post-stream.
[338:15.11]And the pre-stream.
[338:16.95]And the current stream.
[338:21.12]Thank you, though.
[338:22.80]BurntMuffins gave $50.
[338:24.38]And they just say, I like you.
[338:27.17]Thank you, Burt Muffins, for the 5,000 bits.
[338:29.91]For the $50, I'm gonna just put that in my pocket, and I'm gonna buy 50 McChickens with it.
[338:33.65]That's a lot of money.
[338:37.63]Thank you.
[338:37.95]Seriously.
[338:38.49]There's been a lot of it.
[338:39.23]A ton of it.
[338:40.12]An uncountable fucking amount.
[338:44.04]Thanks, guys.
[338:44.36]There's even more.
[338:47.36]Reggie G, thanks for the $40.
[338:49.32]4,000 bits is just ridiculous.
[338:54.28]I've been watching ads for two years to be able to do this.
[338:57.63]I've been watching you since middle school and will be a senior this year.
[339:00.43]I've been around for too long.
[339:03.49]I've been around a long time.
[339:04.47]And I just wanted to say thanks for all the laughs and everything you do.
[339:06.55]You've done so much for me and the community.
[339:07.83]It's hard to believe someone as amazing as you exists.
[339:10.99]I don't know about that.
[339:13.70]I'm just a guy.
[339:14.30]I don't know about that.
[339:18.02]I appreciate it, though.
[339:22.84]Hope the best for you and your health.
[339:24.10]Take care.
[339:24.50]Thank you.
[339:31.41]That's an incredibly high thing to say about somebody.
[339:39.42]But... I just like to have fun, and I'm kind of just a guy.
[339:44.16]He's a sacrificial streamer.
[339:47.26]Thank you for the $40.
[339:48.32]That seems like watching ads for two years to be able to do that.
[339:51.26]That's... See, that alone is... That two years of ads for $40...
[340:00.85]That's a long time.
[340:05.47]And Twitch.
[340:06.69]What's going on with that ad revenue?
[340:09.94]Two years.
[340:19.32]40 years of ads.
[340:20.30]What's going on here?
[340:29.06]But I can't believe someone would watch two years worth of ads to give me money.
[340:34.07]That's just, I can't even comprehend that.
[340:36.81]You understand?
[340:37.33]That's incomprehensible to me.
[340:42.72]Hey, see you when I get back at 100.
[340:44.04]Hey, see you when I get back at 100.
[340:46.72]We'll see what happens.
[340:48.36]A lying, lying figure thanks to those free bucks.
[340:51.66]I went through a period of five or so years with undiagnosed health problems.
[340:55.22]And while I was sick, stuck in bed, I used to keep myself sane with streams like yours.
[341:00.35]You've given up so much.
[341:01.29]You've given us so much.
[341:02.65]Take all the time you need.
[341:03.67]Thank you.
[341:06.29]I'll be back and I look forward to not having to ever bring this up ever fucking again.
[341:11.78]You know how much I look forward to not having to have this conversation ever again?
[341:16.92]I look forward to not having to talk about this.
[341:18.66]Ever.
[341:20.06]We just do whatever.
[341:21.55]We do our thing.
[341:22.33]Like it always was.
[341:26.37]Elemental Penguin Music, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[341:28.71]And EdgeWVVB, thanks for 5 community subs.
[341:35.42]PrincessKitty666, 50 bucks, 5,000.
[341:37.04]That's a lot of money.
[341:43.79]There's been 50, 50, 50, 100, 100, 200, 200, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 100, 200, 200, 300, 300.
[341:48.09]I'm just gonna bring all this to the doctor's office and just drop it in a coin bag.
[341:57.32]Alright, okay.
[341:58.66]Alright, can you fix me?
[342:02.99]Let's go.
[342:07.55]It's a ton of money, guys.
[342:10.06]But Princess Kitty, they say PP Man.
[342:11.98]That was $50 to say PP Man.
[342:14.34]Thank you for the 5,000 bits.
[342:17.12]Thank you, PP Man.
[342:19.62]$50.
[342:21.06]Cosmic Bit.
[342:21.70]Thanks for the free bucks.
[342:22.56]Please, Jeremy, take my money.
[342:24.26]I will.
[342:25.19]And I did.
[342:27.27]Thank you.
[342:28.49]Robofussin.
[342:29.25]Thanks for the $2.50.
[342:29.61]Sorry if it was already explained, but how much work went into the breakdance joke in the green screen stream?
[342:33.79]Did you take classes again?
[342:34.79]Nope, I just decided to do it because my brain said do it.
[342:38.39]That's all it took?
[342:42.96]Yeah.
[342:43.12]Looking at this card.
[342:43.93]And people made a huge card with a ton of people that were involved a while back when I was still having this problem.
[342:47.75]And among other things.
[343:13.94]So, I appreciate it.
[343:18.52]Mostly lost thanks for the 250, Jerma.
[343:20.98]I'm really sad to hear how your chest caved in after being exposed to 5G.
[343:24.89]I tried to warn Jeff Bezos this would happen, but he just didn't listen.
[343:28.61]Anyway, I just know that we all want... I just know that... I imagine, like... What you mean by that is...
[343:39.21]Like, you have no profile picture on Twitter.
[343:41.99]And you tagged the wrong Jeff Bezos.
[343:45.19]We have to do something about this 5G, Jeff.
[343:49.79]That's what I picture.
[343:53.19]Why didn't he listen to me?
[343:56.45]Anyway, just know that we all want you to be the best you can.
[343:58.87]So get the problem taken care of.
[344:00.25]So you can come back feeling your best.
[344:02.05]He just didn't listen to me.
[344:05.62]I mean, I wrote the tweet to him.
[344:07.04]Why didn't he write back?
[344:09.31]what's going on here I I talked to him why didn't he talk to me oh god bingo sunshine thanks to the five dolls not to re-litigate the newgrounds posts
[344:28.09]But I notice that many of them are from 2005.
[344:29.23]You know what else came out in 2005?
[344:33.33]Revenge of the Sith.
[344:34.17]Kid Fisto's death.
[344:36.95]Time is a flat circle.
[344:39.14]F in the chat.
[344:47.88]Revenge of the Sith.
[344:49.10]It's so weird.
[344:52.62]Because... Those movies...
[344:57.41]That was the biggest deal in human history.
[345:01.29]Some people say it was like the Yankins or the Mayans or the, you know, the Ming dynasty.
[345:05.20]No, no, no, no.
[345:05.94]It was when the first prequel movie came out.
[345:11.16]That was the biggest event in human history.
[345:20.74]That was the only thing that anyone talked about.
[345:24.22]That's boomer cringe.
[345:27.21]I know.
[345:27.41]Why do you think I'm bringing it up?
[345:30.15]That's unbelievable.
[345:32.81]Who cares?
[345:34.07]Just a bunch of ships shooting at each other in the sky.
[345:37.05]And lasers with little laser swords.
[345:41.66]Really?
[345:43.30]More important than the Ming Dynasty?
[345:46.78]Than the Incans?
[345:50.85]That's unbelievable.
[346:00.69]You know, the Aztecs?
[346:03.47]How many other nations can he name from the video game Rise of Nations?
[346:07.50]Because that's the only reason why he's saying these.
[346:09.30]Hey, Uber Morph Point.
[346:17.34]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[346:20.25]What would you do in the case of a trolley problem?
[346:24.15]Would you let a trolley kill five people without interfering?
[346:26.65]Or would you change the track to make the choice to kill one person?
[346:35.97]There are no trolleys where I live.
[346:38.50]This statement doesn't make any sense to me.
[346:41.26]How big is this trolley?
[346:43.82]Is it big enough?
[346:44.42]Could I stop it with my bare hands?
[346:48.96]You won't answer it.
[346:52.58]Would you let the trolley... So the trolley is just flying down the trolley track.
[346:59.15]And I can pull a lever for the trolley to run a guy over.
[347:03.23]Or let the trolley go forward and die or something.
[347:10.38]Okay.
[347:11.76]Um... But how can I be certain that I can change this track?
[347:17.00]If I go over there and pull it and it's too heavy...
[347:19.90]And what if it, like, snaps?
[347:21.48]And what if I do it wrong?
[347:22.36]I don't know how to do it.
[347:25.49]You just are.
[347:26.53]What if I can't do it?
[347:30.55]That's the real question.
[347:32.45]It will kill five if you don't switch it.
[347:35.63]Okay, no, I have a solution.
[347:37.37]So I'm in control of the track, and I'm pulling the lever.
[347:40.14]So what I can do here is the guy that's standing where the track is going to go, I'm just going to scream...
[347:46.68]Get out of the fucking way!
[347:48.16]Get out of the way!
[347:48.94]Get out of the way!
[347:50.64]I'm gonna pull it.
[347:52.82]I'm gonna scream.
[347:54.20]It's coming!
[347:55.38]It's coming over to you!
[347:57.17]It's coming to you!
[347:58.87]I know I'm doing like the 15-year-old screaming because you don't want to wake up mom on Xbox Live.
[348:03.55]I know.
[348:09.35]Hurry.
[348:09.69]No, I'd be like, I'd be like, dude!
[348:12.16]It's a train coming your way!
[348:14.44]It's about to crash into you!
[348:17.04]Fuck you, Mocha Joe!
[348:20.20]It just turned into that.
[348:26.69]The person's tied down and unable to move?
[348:35.63]Well, what cartoon universe am I in?
[348:40.31]Is there an old-timey piano playing in the background too?
[348:46.65]Do I talk and then does it cut to a black and white screen with text on it?
[348:51.90]It's a moral dilemma.
[348:54.68]Guys, moral dilemmas don't have a right answer.
[348:56.86]They're all bad.
[348:58.38]If I pull the lever, he's dead.
[348:59.78]If I let him go, they're dead.
[349:01.45]Okay, you're a bad person.
[349:03.87]Hey, uh, I would pull the lever.
[349:05.49]You're a bad person.
[349:06.61]I would let those people just crash.
[349:07.73]You're a bad person.
[349:08.99]Okay, so I'm a bad person.
[349:11.39]How about this?
[349:12.55]Instead of answering the question, I'm just a bad fucking person.
[349:16.02]That's all I need to say.
[349:17.48]Done.
[349:17.64]I don't have to answer the question now.
[349:20.04]Now you just know that I'm a bad person.
[349:32.64]So you would just let five people die.
[349:34.28]No, I would yell, hey, hey, dude, pull that lever.
[349:38.46]And then I would run.
[349:41.50]Hey, dude, pull that lever.
[349:42.53]There's more of the lever going on.
[349:44.77]It's on you now.
[349:56.31]Pull the lever.
[349:57.27]No, make a sign that says, free coffee to a person that pulls the lever.
[350:00.77]And then just get the fuck out.
[350:04.87]That's the real Joker chaotic neutral way to do it.
[350:13.49]So you would pull the lever.
[350:14.31]No, I wouldn't.
[350:15.51]I would write a note saying free coffee if you pull the lever.
[350:19.27]But what I'm talking about is I'm talking about the lever that's on your coffee maker.
[350:23.04]I'd be like, no, I'm talking about the lever that's on the coffee, the coffee made that you pull.
[350:26.96]What are you talking about?
[350:28.02]Holy shit.
[350:28.68]Are you crazy?
[350:29.44]Are you out of your mind?
[350:30.64]You're a bad person, aren't you?
[350:34.04]I'm spending too much time on this and I'm going to stop it now.
[350:38.38]A nom no men see.
[350:42.13]Thanks for the three bucks.
[350:45.99]I'm going through a rough patch at the moment and your streams are a nice break from the world.
[350:49.15]I want to say thank you so much for your amazing streams, man.
[350:51.93]Please take care of yourself.
[350:54.59]Thank you.
[350:57.11]I plan on it.
[350:59.85]Wish you the best.
[351:02.55]Blueberry juice, $5.
[351:03.99]Jeremy, you have to promise that you'll get better, not just try to get better.
[351:06.65]Remember, it's like my favorite Star Wars character, Kit Fisto, always said, do or do not, there is no try.
[351:13.29]Rip Kit Fisto.
[351:20.76]I'm gonna do it.
[351:22.12]I'm gonna do it.
[351:23.60]I'm gonna do it.
[351:24.86]I can't promise you, though, because I'm gonna do it.
[351:27.94]I promise that I'm gonna do it.
[351:29.10]There you go.
[351:30.28]I'm gonna do it.
[351:32.65]Mad stormy killer thanks for the thousand bits.
[351:35.61]I just want to say thank you for all that you do and I'm really happy that you chose to sacrifice so much for Twitch.
[351:40.34]Hope everything regarding your health goes well.
[351:43.58]I don't even think, I'm not even sure I would word it like that.
[351:49.80]Just a guy that likes to make jokes and hang out and talk shit about fucking companies.
[351:55.63]It's kind of like a shitty guy.
[351:57.17]A shitty guy.
[352:00.66]You know, I just like to make jokes and hang out and talk shit about companies.
[352:04.35]I'm just kind of a bad guy.
[352:07.53]I pulled that lever.
[352:08.75]We already went over it.
[352:11.77]He's an NDA breaker.

[353:17.69]He's a funny bastard.
[353:18.97]I'll tell you.
[353:20.59]I love Silicon Valley.
[353:22.69]I'm not a fan anymore because I'm a loser and I don't watch TV.
[353:26.27]But I watched the first four seasons at least of that show.
[353:28.77]That's a really good show.
[353:35.11]Mike Judge.
[353:35.51]Come on.
[353:35.79]Watch it.
[353:36.67]What do they do?

[354:09.40]I'm only 10.
[354:10.48]I'm only 10.
[354:11.08]That's a strange thing to brag about.
[354:20.17]That is kind of a weird thing to brag about.
[354:26.94]By the way, I think his mic is being picked up by the webcam and not by the microphone that he has plugged into the computer.
[354:31.88]He's really funny.
[354:34.44]I love his work.
[354:47.63]I was a huge fan of Silicon Valley the first, like, three or four seasons.
[354:49.99]And then I'm a loser.
[354:51.35]I don't watch TV anymore because I'm a fucking loser.

[355:46.63]It was an interesting thought project that I had.
[355:55.75]Oh, yeah.
[355:56.25]Why do cigarettes smell like raisins?
[355:59.21]Why do cigarettes smell like raisins?
[356:00.99]Just like unsmoked cigarettes.
[356:05.72]It's kind of strange.
[356:06.54]Why?
[356:07.98]They don't.
[356:08.26]Yes, they do.
[356:09.38]That's not false.

[356:22.02]They do.
[356:22.56]Raisins.
[356:23.74]It's true.
[356:24.38]They literally don't.
[356:25.04]They literally do.
[356:26.20]They literally do.
[356:32.40]This is problematic.
[356:33.26]No, they literally do.
[356:34.24]Literally.

[359:06.89]Slug brain, thanks for the $5.
[359:08.69]Jerma, last year I went through a really rough time.
[359:11.09]I was going through a breakup as well as a best friend breakup.
[359:15.43]I also lost my job and learned I was going to lose my apartment.
[359:18.09]Holy shit, man.
[359:19.84]I'm so sorry to hear all that.
[359:22.10]During that time, your streams helped me through some extremely rough nights.
[359:25.90]I was just going to ask.
[359:26.68]I'm doing better now, and I want you to be feeling better too.
[359:30.76]Please get well, and thanks for everything you do.
[359:32.30]Funny little man.
[359:33.48]Glad to hear it.
[359:35.30]I was... Hopefully you were gonna... One of the sentences here would say that you were doing a little better, because that's a lot.
[359:42.23]That's a lot of bad shit to happen.
[359:45.79]I'm glad you're doing better.
[359:46.57]Thank you, Slugbrain.

[360:02.10]Thanks for the 250.
[360:03.06]Jerma, fuck you.
[360:03.84]I hope you feel all good soon.
[360:05.19]A lot of emotions in this one.
[360:08.87]Thank you, I think I'm going to say.
[360:11.84]Shammy uh shimmy sham thanks for the five dollars Jerma just gonna drop some love like the rest of chat big fan since TF2 as someone who had shingles at 25 they warned me about that muscular condition so it hit especially close to home that my favorite streamer could be afflicted with it you deserve the best treatment and we'll be here for you when you're ready to come back love you yeah I I don't know I still don't know if that's the right answer
[360:42.49]But I can't just keep slowly punching away at it.
[360:48.21]But make no mistake, it's not like I have been ignoring this.
[360:51.84]I've been going to the doctor every month, once every one or two months, I'm in and out of the doctor for this.
[361:01.80]But it's definitely not enough.
[361:04.94]And I need to focus on it completely.
[361:07.08]That's what I'm going to do.
[361:13.17]Hey, Nessham... Nesshamantha, thanks for the three bucks.
[361:16.59]Jerma, I don't know what it's like to have IBD.
[361:19.01]No, I do... I know what it's like to have IBD.
[361:22.15]I have Crohn's and a myriad of undiagnosed things.
[361:24.89]Going from doctor to doctor sucks, but I know you will get through it.
[361:27.55]You're an amazing person and you always brighten up everyone's days.
[361:29.85]Thank you so much and get well soon.
[361:34.61]Yeah, IBD is no joke.
[361:37.83]It is...
[361:40.02]Really, really annoying.
[361:41.64]It's hard to manage, but once you get it managed, you can usually keep it pretty quiet.
[361:46.97]Please do Kid Fisto one more time.
[361:49.65]No, no.
[361:50.51]That'll ruin it for me.
[361:52.51]It'll ruin it for me.
[362:00.32]We have a few more bits to do, but I just want to say goodbye.
[362:03.80]Good night.
[362:06.20]I'll be back.
[362:07.15]Hopefully stronger than ever.
[362:09.85]And with answers this time.
[362:11.01]Taking extended time off the stream is stuff I don't like to do.
[362:18.89]And I know I just moved.
[362:20.47]And there was a bunch of time that I wasn't around.
[362:22.59]And this is just... A lot is just... But it has to be done.
[362:26.37]And I've got to look to the long term, not the short term.
[362:32.17]Thank you all for your incredible support.
[362:35.28]If you're taking off, you're taking off.
[362:36.92]I'll see you when I see you, which will be probably sooner than you think.
[362:41.28]It's not going to be a situation where I'm gone for more than a month or two.
[362:44.00]That's not going to happen.
[362:48.55]I will be back within the next two to three weeks.
[362:54.03]I'll be back.
[362:57.67]Let me finish the bits.
[362:59.71]We had $5 from Quinny.
[363:02.27]Thank you, Quinny, for the $5.
[363:02.97]Hey, friend, not many things make me genuinely stop being anxious and just hang out and laugh for a bit.
[363:08.45]The Gamer V Portable stream made me laugh in a way that I haven't felt since childhood.
[363:12.57]And with everything going on, with my panic attacks getting worse, that is everything.
[363:17.15]Thank you.
[363:17.49]I appreciate you more than you ever know.
[363:19.37]Have a great night.
[363:19.99]Make sure you eat well and take care of yourself during the next few weeks.
[363:25.00]That was a wild one.
[363:26.66]That was a shitty microphone stream, right?
[363:33.13]Didn't I have a... I had like a handheld mic.
[363:38.89]Didn't I tape a handheld mic to my mouth?
[363:43.32]Why don't I just get a boom mic?
[363:44.64]I don't know why I keep doing this to myself.
[363:46.20]They're not even that expensive.
[363:49.46]It's not like, oh wow, that's expensive.
[363:50.84]No, just get one.
[363:54.90]Hey Latchy, thanks for five bucks.
[363:56.26]Jeremiah, I started watching you when I was recovering from asthma attacks.
[363:59.56]The first streams I watched were you Super Mario Sunshine ones.
[364:02.77]And I haven't missed one since.
[364:03.99]That's pretty recent.
[364:05.65]So I'm a noob shaking my head.
[364:07.25]Now you know.
[364:10.99]You're a wonderful person and I hope whatever is messing you up gets sorted out soon.

[365:12.78]Just now realized I didn't meet the bit amount to be read.
[365:15.20]I did a funny joke with my previous message, but I'm too lazy to type it again.
[365:19.01]Sorry, feel better.
[365:21.15]I can tell you what the text I wrote at the top means if you want.
[365:23.79]Uh, this is one piece?
[365:32.32]This is, this is, did you just spoil the whole, is this, this is like a spoiler placemat.
[365:40.25]Is this a spoiler of, like, Denny's placemat?
[365:45.18]Of the whole entire show?
[365:46.48]I'm gonna show this, but be aware, this is a fucking placemat.
[365:51.45]Of spoilers for the show.
[365:52.83]One Piece.
[365:53.79]You ready?
[365:54.65]Here it comes.
[365:56.56]Is this what, is this what, those are the only people that have watched the show.
[366:09.55]He's spoiled.
[366:10.85]This is every character that lives or dies on the show.
[366:18.51]Okay, they said, what's the text mean at the top?
[366:21.23]He said, I'll read it to you.
[366:22.51]What is it?
[366:27.23]It's the cover of the books.
[366:28.29]Oh, whatever.
[366:31.43]Thanks for the three bucks.
[366:33.57]Hey, Kitty Lot, thanks for the three bucks.
[366:34.92]Jerma, I'm very sad to hear that you were injured.
[366:37.19]They're sending you to the glue factory.
[366:39.30]Joking aside, I hope the doc helps you.
[366:40.98]I've only been watching a couple years, but your stream is genuinely a force for good.
[366:46.10]Also, my robot dog says hi.
[366:47.68]Hello, robot dog.
[366:48.66]Thanks for the three bucks, kitty.
[366:52.44]Worm Club 250, thanks for the $2.50.
[366:54.64]I had a dream that on stream one day you explained that in real life you're a psycho and a sick freak, and that off stream you watch non-stop horror movies, horror games, and true crime documentaries, and the violence makes you feel nothing.
[367:08.71]You said that in order to seem funny and not morbid on stream, you warm up beforehand by watching classic stand-up comedy and quoting the jokes word for word as they're delivered, pretending you're the one on stage.
[367:28.11]Why am I such a weirdo?
[367:29.43]Why am I such a weird, scary guy?
[367:33.30]Nobody ever has dreams where I work in a soup kitchen.
[367:38.18]You know, where are the dreams of me working at the animal shelter?
[367:42.92]And saying please and thank you.
[367:45.38]No, no, this guy's just a sicko.
[367:47.32]And he like buries bodies in his basement.
[367:54.27]They're dreams of betrayal.
[367:56.45]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[368:01.43]Thanks for the 250 and the wicked messed up dream.
[368:04.27]Hey, Keith King Crimson, thanks for the 250.
[368:06.11]Love you, Jerma.
[368:06.69]Get well.
[368:07.29]I'm going to try to.
[368:11.28]Hey, King Sherbert, thanks for $5.
[368:12.90]Jerma, do you like Larry David?
[368:14.00]You guys are kind of similar.
[368:16.58]I love Larry David he's like my favorite person in the world uh Larry David is like my favorite comedian probably he's like I think he's one of the most smart one of the most intelligent funny I think he's great he's great he's fantastic top five comedy writers and comedy actors done if you've never seen kirby enthusiasm the first
[368:38.32]The first, like, four or five episodes, you're gonna be like, this is dumb.
[368:40.72]It's just a couple of fucking old guys yelling at each other.
[368:43.25]But trust me.
[368:44.47]Get through season one and season two and into season three, four, five, and six.
[368:47.65]Season seven's the best season.
[368:49.21]I know.
[368:49.47]So what about season six?
[368:50.47]No, no.
[368:50.71]Season seven's the best curb season.
[368:52.65]If you disagree, I'm sorry.
[368:54.64]I'm not sure what it feels like to be wrong.
[369:01.64]They're all good.
[369:02.10]I'm kidding.
[369:04.66]What an ego.
[369:05.72]Only watch season 7.
[369:06.88]No, no, watch them all.
[369:08.04]They're all good.
[369:09.46]They're all... Okay, if season 7 is a 9.8, then like season 6 is like a 9.6.
[369:13.48]They're all at least 9.3.
[369:14.25]All of them.
[369:14.67]Anyways.
[369:24.12]I do, I think it's great.
[369:25.20]Here's some money.

[370:39.13]Ethan, thanks for 250.
[370:39.97]I had a dream last night that you were a professor in college and you got mad at the class because we didn't do your homework on sausages.
[370:50.26]Pigeon, thanks for the 250.
[370:51.92]Rank these.
[370:52.78]Bill Burr, Dave Chappelle, and Larry David.
[370:57.38]Oh, no.
[370:59.28]Oh, no.
[370:59.94]That's... I don't know if I can do that.
[371:02.78]Oh, man.
[371:07.39]Oh, no.
[371:11.72]I love Bill Burr.
[371:13.70]He's so funny.
[371:14.58]He's one of the most off-the-cuff, witty people that I've ever watched.
[371:18.38]But he's probably three.
[371:20.96]I mean, I... It's a comedian tier list.
[371:29.46]It's tough, though.
[371:30.28]Dave Chappelle is... Oh, I was such a huge fan of Dave Chappelle during Chappelle's show.
[371:39.73]Larry David, though...
[371:41.79]Can they be tied?
[371:49.29]No, they can't.
[371:51.95]No ties.
[371:55.12]Larry David!
[371:56.72]Larry!
[372:00.18]Oh!
[372:01.62]Oh!
[372:02.68]Larry David.
[372:03.40]Dave Chappelle.
[372:04.21]Bill Burke.
[372:07.29]And the difference between Larry David and Dave Chappelle is not even like 0.2% change.
[372:24.01]Clap, clap, clap.
[372:24.77]You've passed the test.
[372:25.91]How is that a test?
[372:33.80]I love Dave Chappelle.
[372:34.72]Dave Chappelle's fucking hilarious.
[372:35.74]He's just one of those legendary comedians that... I loved Dave Chappelle's show.
[372:44.25]Dave Chappelle did this awesome thing where at the end of streams... At the end of his stream, he would bring on musicians and they would do a musical number.
[372:56.56]Every single show, right?
[372:57.36]They would do either a video or in person sometimes, right?
[373:02.22]He always had like a musical guest that was just on the show.
[373:05.40]And that was kind of unheard of for something that wasn't like the Jay Leno Tonight Show.
[373:11.09]Because the format was, you know, pre-recorded.
[373:13.47]It was a scripted show, but it was still cool.
[373:18.87]Oh, this guy's outro is so long, he's fucked.
[373:22.21]Well, this one was an exception considering I'm not going to be around.
[373:29.34]but I'll see you later pigeon thanks for 250 more thank you have some more always nice to see thank you and then you foley g thanks for five dollars I had a dream a while ago where I watched you escape from prison anyway xoxo get better uh
[373:52.91]Thank you.
[373:53.41]Thank you, everybody, for the absurd amount of money.
[373:57.73]There was thousands of dollars.
[374:02.37]Thousands of fucking dollars.
[374:05.13]So many messages.
[374:06.22]I can't even comprehend it.
[374:07.66]Thank you, guys.
[374:09.52]I'm going to get better.
[374:10.12]I'll be back.
[374:11.36]I'm going to do all this medical shit and see if I can get this taken care of once and for all and not have to ever talk about it again.
[374:19.37]We are going to raid Vinny.
[374:20.99]Vinny is live.
[374:22.77]Currently 10, 11, 12, 1.
[374:25.21]Vinny usually streams pretty late, so it's a good choice.
[374:29.33]And I will see you guys when I see you.
[374:31.67]Over the next couple of weeks between... Anywhere from 10 to 20 days.
[374:38.08]Somewhere in that range.
[374:40.90]I hope I come back and I hope I'm better.
[374:42.28]I hope I can tell you that.
[374:45.42]Good night.
[374:46.56]See you soon.
[374:47.76]If you weren't here before, the second channel is going to get a monster amount of content while I'm gone.
[374:52.98]We're bringing on a bunch of new editors.
[374:55.78]The backlog is going to get ripped through completely.
[374:58.14]They're going to chew through all those old streams.
[375:01.08]You might not... You're going to see probably like one to two videos a day.
[375:06.66]The next few weeks.
[375:09.48]I'm not sure when that's going to start, but it's going to start fairly soon.
[375:14.81]Thank you, everybody.
[375:16.07]Good night.
[375:16.86]Take care of yourselves.
[375:18.08]This is Raid Vinny.
[375:19.30]See you soon.
[375:19.90]Thanks again.
