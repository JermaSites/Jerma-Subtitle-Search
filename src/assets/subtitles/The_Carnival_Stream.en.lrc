[05:36.35]Thank you.
[06:53.90]Thank you.
[08:07.03]Thank you.
[08:37.24]Thank you.
[09:26.78]Something's on my way over here.
[09:57.66]I get lost sometimes.
[10:10.40]How do I?
[10:13.74]What?
[10:14.10]Hey!
[10:17.70]Hey, how are you?
[10:18.98]Let me just quickly, let me park this thing.
[10:36.76]Can I park here?
[10:37.50]Is that okay?
[10:38.34]Can I park in here?
[10:40.72]It's alright, I'm gonna be here for a few minutes.
[10:48.64]I think that's alright.
[10:51.33]That's good, now that'll be fine.
[11:02.29]It's alright, that's okay.
[11:03.41]That's gonna be fine.
[11:04.86]Hey, which camera are we on?
[11:07.00]You, you, you.
[11:09.20]I don't know.
[11:09.78]I'm not sure.
[11:10.42]This one right here.
[11:11.22]How are you?
[11:11.70]Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Jerma985 and partnership with Andy Mark Carnival.
[11:18.59]Now, I know a lot of you are probably wondering what's going on here.
[11:22.19]I'll give you a brief description.
[11:24.23]I'm so excited for this.
[11:25.63]I literally, this has been a long time coming and I do have to just really shout out a few people here.
[11:32.44]You're going to have a lot of fun.
[11:33.74]First of all, I want to thank Andy Mark for their contracting of the robots.
[11:38.81]They did an insane job.
[11:40.55]You have no idea what you're talking about.
[11:44.31]Listen to me.
[11:44.91]You have no idea.
[11:45.91]We're going to go to this camera, too, because I can't see chat.
[11:49.37]That's my problem.
[11:51.71]We're going to this one.
[11:57.64]I have power.
[11:58.72]I have real power.
[12:01.11]Now I can see chat.
[12:01.85]Yeah, that's my fault.
[12:03.01]I'm an idiot, and I crashed it.
[12:04.25]Whatever.
[12:05.23]I want to thank Andy Mark, especially.
[12:07.57]You don't see them, but they're back here.
[12:09.01]And they did a hell of a job making these robots.
[12:11.75]But what role?
[12:12.27]What are you talking about?
[12:13.69]We're going to be playing games on this stream.
[12:15.15]This is a carnival.
[12:16.57]So what do you do at a carnival?
[12:18.05]You play games.
[12:18.87]And there is not one game.
[12:21.89]There are not two games.
[12:23.65]No.
[12:24.61]There are not three games on this stream.
[12:26.87]Not four, not five, not six.
[12:30.61]Hopefully this doesn't blow away.
[12:32.39]I really hope it doesn't.
[12:33.77]Because we've got strong winds in the forecast.
[12:36.30]That thing goes, fuck it, you know, whatever.
[12:40.06]We get, you know, that type of thing.
[12:42.12]There are seven, seven games that are going to be played.
[12:47.10]That's right.
[12:48.08]And they range from all kinds of different things.
[12:50.40]These games are going to be played by you.
[12:54.01]Not me.
[12:54.31]They're going to be played by you.
[12:57.19]By you.
[12:57.73]Yeah, so I'm seeing some germovenuses over here.
[13:00.35]What are you saying?
[13:02.69]700,000.
[13:02.85]No, no, no.
[13:05.86]I know.
[13:06.20]I know.
[13:06.66]Listen.
[13:07.54]I know I look like a group of soccer coaches banged a bunch of Red Lobster employees.
[13:12.42]But that's beyond the point, OK?
[13:15.68]We are going to move to different games today and some other special surprises as well.
[13:21.43]So stay tuned.
[13:22.39]I hope you enjoy this.
[13:24.25]A lot of time went into this.
[13:26.09]So I mean, if we can really decide when we're going to move to the first game, that's why I have the power here.
[13:32.80]Remember, this is my controller.
[13:34.20]I press this three or four times, and we move to the next game.
[13:37.74]So I am just going to be going like this.
[13:43.02]Somebody gif that.
[13:44.62]Put it on the fucking Reddit.
[13:49.89]What are you saying?
[13:53.14]No, stop.
[13:54.20]No, stop.
[13:54.86]What do you mean stop?
[13:55.50]Why am I stopping?
[13:56.22]Get it quick.
[13:58.03]He's a Redditor.
[14:01.75]So I use Reddit.
[14:03.03]I've been on Reddit like twice.
[14:04.97]Is that a problem?
[14:07.91]There's a bug on the camera?
[14:12.35]Which one?
[14:13.27]Which one of the cameras has the bug on it?
[14:21.42]Top right.
[14:23.92]I don't know which one is my right.
[14:25.46]This up here?
[14:27.68]No, that's a Jerma985 logo, to make sure that you know where this fucking came from.
[14:34.39]Alright.
[14:35.47]So first up, you're going to have a series of controls on your screen.
[14:42.17]Series of controls.
[14:43.37]They're going to be W, A, S, D, up, down, left, right, power, decrease power, increase power.
[14:49.93]You're going to see them on the screen.
[14:51.67]The first game that we're going to do
[14:54.82]is ring toss.
[14:56.68]That's right.
[14:58.64]I'll demonstrate before we go.
[15:00.57]You know, I'm gonna demonstrate the ring toss for you.
[15:03.37]Ring toss is the first one.
[15:05.21]And we got ring toss, we got a pitching machine, we've got, you guys have no idea.
[15:11.27]This is like literally, I'm, can you hear the wind?
[15:16.44]This is gonna be crazy.
[15:18.28]So.
[15:21.94]Are we ready for the first game?
[15:25.19]We're ready for the first game.
[15:26.66]You know, I'm getting worried about having a secret service.
[15:28.72]Do you see this?
[15:29.08]You didn't think I was going to have a fucking secret service thing in my ear.
[15:32.48]I do.
[15:33.40]First game.
[15:34.00]Let's go.
[15:34.60]Ring toss.
[15:35.38]Cue it up.
[15:51.63]Hey.
[15:52.96]How are you?
[15:54.89]You see on the screen right now, you have a series of commands and graphics.
[15:59.07]And those commands are going to directly connotate to the movements of the robot that you will see on the screen here very shortly, right now.
[16:08.02]I will prove that this game is winnable, by the way.
[16:10.30]If I can get a ring over here.
[16:16.46]As we see, exhibit A. I heard a balloon pop.
[16:24.09]Get down.
[16:24.55]Get out of here.
[16:26.09]Take a look at this.
[16:32.88]I'm the carny.
[16:33.60]I got to prove you can do it first.
[16:39.90]Give me another couple.
[16:47.75]OK.
[16:47.89]Three more tries and I'll get it.
[16:56.57]I practiced this for like an hour.
[16:59.91]There you go.
[17:03.32]Yes!
[17:04.52]So it's possible.
[17:05.30]You see, I gotta prove it's possible first.
[17:07.72]As you see here, this is the first of the three Andy Mark created robots.
[17:16.62]Can we get a shot of this robot, please, somebody?
[17:19.18]I wanna get this thing in the camera, because look at this thing.
[17:21.80]It's absolutely stunning.
[17:24.60]This is a launcher
[17:27.06]You have to go where you want it to go to launch by the way.
[17:30.96]Very important.
[17:32.90]This thing is going to have a timer on the screen.
[17:36.04]There's a rumor here.
[17:37.02]I don't know if you heard that.
[17:38.71]There's a rumor here.
[17:40.37]They fucking follow me everywhere.
[17:42.23]I literally flew across the country, and I can hear that.
[17:46.47]Like literally.
[17:47.45]That's un-fucking-believable.
[17:49.41]Anyways, so there's going to be a series of commands on the screen.
[17:52.23]They're right there.
[17:53.79]You have to control this.
[17:55.65]It will only accept inputs when there's the green light on the bottom of the screen.
[18:00.73]When the timer reaches zero, it fires.
[18:03.79]So make sure you get it in the right spot.
[18:05.81]And I'm seeing people spam it already.
[18:08.53]That's not how it works.
[18:09.29]You have to wait.
[18:10.35]Wait till it's ready.
[18:12.07]Green light means go.
[18:14.15]Can we get a demonstration of what it looks like?
[18:18.28]Interesting stuff.
[18:24.76]Well, I'm talking to, oh!
[18:25.90]That was a little overshot, but you get the idea.
[18:32.46]I thought I could do it without looking.
[18:35.72]So, when the command is green, please control the robot, if you will.
[18:43.66]Let's see if maybe we can get it loaded for you.
[18:45.96]I actually have to make sure I collect these.
[18:48.98]I have to make sure I collect them because they're gonna be gone.
[18:53.19]When the timer's on the screen, you see the green light.
[18:54.83]That means you can control it.
[19:00.85]I see green light.
[19:01.52]Go.
[19:11.06]It's actually working.
[19:12.94]It works.
[19:14.53]It's phenomenal.
[19:15.83]When that timer reaches zero, it's going to fire that ring.
[19:28.04]Really?
[19:29.88]OK.
[19:32.00]Don't shoot at the guy, OK?
[19:33.46]I just want to make that really clear.
[19:35.10]Don't shoot at the guy.
[19:36.00]You've got to get three of these, and we're not going to move on until you get all three.
[19:40.66]Oh, shoot at the streamer.
[19:41.90]He's a streamer.
[19:43.08]You've got to get three.
[19:46.34]I've got a drink around here somewhere.
[19:47.56]I don't know what the hell it is.
[19:51.30]How many you got?
[19:51.72]Zero?
[19:52.07]You guys, nice try.
[19:56.05]Disabled commands, by the way.
[19:58.43]Disabled commands.
[19:59.43]Do not write commands when it's at red.
[20:02.48]Because when it's at red, your commands are not going to be taken because we're doing it on a timer.
[20:07.38]That's wonderful.
[20:08.34]Hi.
[20:08.94]Nice to see you.
[20:10.00]Aiming directly at my face.
[20:13.38]You have to win the game.
[20:15.90]You have to play the game.
[20:16.85]When it's green, that's when you do it.
[20:25.79]Win the game.
[20:26.55]Forget about shooting it at me.
[20:32.91]What do we got?
[20:34.75]You think that's a good spot?
[20:36.09]You think that's a good place for it?
[20:39.06]I don't think that's a, it might be a little too high, I think.
[20:42.74]Alright, that was close.
[20:44.28]That was close.
[20:48.06]It was a little too far this way, but you get the idea.
[20:51.18]This is a warmup, guys.
[20:52.96]You are getting warmed up for the inevitable, incredibly complicated events that are gonna take place here soon.
[21:00.09]Seeing some pog jams, that's good.
[21:03.37]What have we got?
[21:03.83]Timer on the screen.
[21:04.77]Let's see it.
[21:05.57]Chat commands have been accepted.
[21:09.55]Anybody going for the back row?
[21:15.08]No, they're going this way.
[21:20.38]Where are you going?
[21:24.62]You're going right in the middle?
[21:27.65]This is insane to see this, by the way, live happening.
[21:32.97]The wind is picking up.
[21:34.21]You guys might get lucky from the wind.
[21:35.79]Oh, shit.
[21:39.28]Strong winds.
[21:42.02]It's going to knock all the bottles over.
[21:43.64]Oh!
[21:47.80]No, that's not a point.
[21:49.00]Not a point.
[21:49.48]Landed in the middle.
[21:50.24]Sorry.
[21:51.96]I should probably show you the prize that you're playing for, but that'll be a surprise, too.
[22:01.82]That was actually pretty close.
[22:03.26]That was as close as you're probably going to come.
[22:04.68]This is hard.
[22:05.18]This is not easy.
[22:11.15]Look at that.
[22:11.87]You can see your movements on screen.
[22:14.81]Remember, there's power as well.
[22:16.43]You're not just controlling left and right.
[22:17.65]You're talking about power level.
[22:20.77]Control your power.
[22:22.51]You've seen Dragon Ball Z. I haven't.
[22:25.03]I mean, I'm never going to watch it, but you've seen it.
[22:27.41]At least like 100 of you.
[22:28.95]Maybe.
[22:30.29]Possibly.
[22:32.51]I gotta get you a better view.
[22:39.23]That looks good.
[22:46.05]Nope.
[22:48.11]That one wasn't even close.
[22:49.89]That was not even close.
[22:55.51]That's so funny.
[22:57.41]So how many are we at?
[22:58.16]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[23:00.76]Oh, like six, a hundred?
[23:02.45]Were there 100 bottles?
[23:05.09]I think there's 100 bottles for you to choose from.
[23:08.59]I'm going to give you a tactic here as the person that's the carny here.
[23:12.44]I would go right in the middle because then it can bounce around.
[23:15.60]You got to do these tactics.
[23:17.32]Get the fuck out of here.
[23:18.50]What a wasted throw.
[23:21.86]Thank you for listening.
[23:23.38]Are you going to listen?
[23:25.62]I don't think you are.
[23:26.10]And you're not going to listen to me?
[23:28.40]You're just going to fire it at my face?
[23:29.46]You're going to just aim this way?
[23:31.26]Good.
[23:31.44]Let's go.
[23:33.34]Let's go.
[23:34.16]Yeah.
[23:34.80]Delete it.
[23:36.42]Delete it.
[23:39.38]I just did it with my mind.
[23:40.60]I looked at it and just snapped it out of existence.
[23:43.91]Just like Big Bird, whatever his name is.
[23:46.43]The purple guy.
[23:47.49]If you've never seen Infinity War, by the way, it's a great movie.
[23:50.81]I would recommend it.
[23:53.81]Just out of nowhere, I just wanted to say that that's a good movie.
[23:56.93]You should watch it if you have a chance.
[23:58.76]No spoilers or anything.
[23:59.72]I don't have a spoiler here.
[24:00.76]It's just a good movie.
[24:05.12]Remember, it's when it's at zero is when it fires.
[24:07.50]You guys are never gonna win this game.
[24:09.54]I'm starting to come to the realization that it's just not gonna happen.
[24:14.16]It's just not gonna happen.
[24:15.46]It's unwinnable.
[24:16.34]Snap that one out of existence too.
[24:21.20]Like Elmo.
[24:24.94]No, no, we got it, we got it, we got it.
[24:32.69]You didn't give enough power.
[24:34.67]You didn't give enough power on that one.
[24:36.35]That was like zero.
[24:38.32]You have to put more power.
[24:40.78]You have to put more power.
[24:43.08]It's got to be at least like, come on.
[24:45.14]You're raising the hammer.
[24:48.52]It's a hammer.
[24:49.68]So you raise it high enough to launch the ring over here.
[24:54.28]It's simple instructions.
[24:56.26]It's very easy.
[24:58.02]You saw me do it.
[24:59.66]I'm surprised that you can't.
[25:01.53]And now you're going all the way down.
[25:02.45]Now you're going all the way.
[25:07.08]Now you're going all the way down.
[25:09.52]You guys are, like, breaking this thing.
[25:11.12]You guys are going too far down.
[25:12.38]Pull it up a little bit.
[25:14.62]Up higher.
[25:15.44]That's not going to do anything.
[25:16.38]Higher.
[25:16.78]Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher.
[25:18.79]I'm just trying to help you here.
[25:20.65]Because, I mean, this is, like, you've got to pull it up a little bit, like, 10%, 20% higher.
[25:23.65]Because, seriously, like, let me show you.
[25:26.29]Like, I'll give you a quick little look.
[25:28.17]Ready?
[25:29.71]That's not going to happen.
[25:32.25]Shit.
[25:40.55]The wind like shot that one.
[25:42.27]The wind just like shot it down.
[25:48.76]I don't want these to fall.
[25:52.38]We got some extreme winds.
[25:55.86]These fall then, this took like 67 minutes to put all these in the right place.
[26:00.69]You understand?
[26:03.15]If the wind picks up high enough, these are gonna fly.
[26:06.65]And then we're gonna have to move on to this next game.
[26:16.08]Let me show you how it works.
[26:20.58]Dammit.
[26:23.82]We're waiting for the wind to settle for a second here.
[26:27.22]If you could believe it, let's go.
[26:29.56]So, let's do it.
[26:33.52]Pull it in.
[26:37.34]Shit.
[26:40.60]I'm not very good at this.
[26:42.02]So the wind,
[26:43.64]is kind of causing a few problems here.
[26:45.38]But, you know, that's what happens when you have 15 million people all at the same time putting commands in with torrential 60 mile per hour winds.
[26:57.23]As you can see, we're trying to accommodate for it.
[27:02.68]But it's pretty difficult.
[27:13.29]There's no way you guys would even get one anyways.
[27:15.61]Not like it was gonna work.
[27:19.49]Chad inputs are now disabled.
[27:25.09]Get a good look.
[27:27.81]Get a great look, because that's what you're looking at.
[27:34.48]I'm gonna make a prediction for you.
[27:37.28]At some point during the stream, there is going to be a scenario where the wind takes something.
[27:44.69]Don't worry, we've got plenty of trained staff on board, and it looks like you've figured it out.
[27:49.95]You've got the machine moving in the right direction.
[27:52.97]There you go, there you go, there you go, there you go.
[27:58.41]Come on, you can get one, please get one.
[28:02.67]This is so insane.
[28:04.64]Two, one.
[28:05.98]Fire!
[28:15.85]That almost went on.
[28:19.39]That's so funny.
[28:22.95]I gotta clear these out.
[28:25.48]I wanna make it easy for you.
[28:26.80]This was perfect.
[28:35.29]Are we ready for commands?
[28:38.33]Are you ready?
[28:39.25]I'm not sure.
[28:41.17]Let's see what happens.
[28:44.21]I just want to see if you get one.
[28:46.37]I want to see if you can get at least two.
[28:52.57]Power, power, change the power.
[28:59.42]Come on, I know you guys can.
[29:01.84]That way, that way, that way.
[29:03.52]Move it this way.
[29:05.67]This way!
[29:06.93]Please!
[29:07.99]Get one!
[29:08.95]Make it worth it!
[29:26.46]I have nothing to say.
[29:27.68]This is just fucking hilarious.
[29:34.84]I'd just like to watch.
[29:41.11]Going for the back left row.
[29:43.59]Interesting choice.
[29:44.89]Let's see if you can do it.
[29:49.43]No, changing your minds, collectively.
[29:53.83]I wonder how many of you are actually trying to... Nice shot.
[30:02.78]I can't even do it from fucking two feet away.
[30:09.49]The wind is like taking balloons.
[30:12.23]This is going to get ugly.
[30:13.21]I don't know if you could just hear that, but there was a very loud crack.
[30:23.58]Right there.
[30:24.72]Right here.
[30:25.02]Try to get in the middle.
[30:25.64]Less power.
[30:26.10]Oh, shit.
[30:32.78]This...
[30:37.18]I don't want to break it before we're done with it.
[30:40.36]Too high.
[30:42.42]Too high.
[30:44.08]Less power is more utility.
[30:50.39]This game is really hard at the actual carnival, let alone one that's controlled by 600 million people right now.
[30:59.29]I don't think you're going to do it.
[31:02.01]I don't think so.
[31:05.81]Good.
[31:06.29]Good.
[31:11.41]You know, I probably shouldn't be standing here.
[31:13.20]That's giving like 60% of the people a target.
[31:24.75]The last one was here.
[31:26.45]That next one was here.
[31:28.41]You got to pull it in a little, just a hair tighter.
[31:31.91]You want it like here, right there, right here.
[31:36.71]You want it right here.
[31:38.31]You want it right here.
[31:40.09]This game's not complete.
[31:47.54]Welcome to the carnival.
[31:50.22]Nothing is winnable.
[31:52.74]Nothing is winnable.
[31:58.70]I want to see one.
[32:12.26]Now you overdid it.
[32:13.72]You overdid it by like 100%.
[32:15.95]Now you underdid it by like 100%.
[32:19.49]Remember, your commands are only accepted when it's a green light.
[32:25.15]I ain't gonna touch anything.
[32:33.89]I'm going to hold this thing down.
[32:35.83]Look, I'll aim for my fucking face, OK?
[32:38.53]We'll make it easy for you.
[32:39.47]Just aim right for my teeth, and then you'll get it.
[32:43.07]Like the 60% of people that want to hit the streamer in the face with a rock, just go right here, right in my face.
[32:50.55]You can do it.
[32:51.72]You can do it.
[32:52.52]I know you can.
[32:54.40]Oh.
[32:59.34]Damn it.
[33:00.12]We had a chance.
[33:03.89]You had a chance.
[33:05.61]Oh, shit.
[33:09.05]It's coming this way.
[33:11.51]It's going to be like a tornado in the background.
[33:22.42]Get away from me.
[33:24.22]You're ruining my carnival.
[33:31.40]Right here?
[33:33.04]I like it.
[33:34.21]I like the idea.
[33:34.91]I will block the wind with my fucking body if I have to.
[33:42.59]Unwinnable.
[33:44.63]Good luck.
[33:50.74]This is going to fly forward and it's going to take up the whole table.
[33:53.80]So I am only here.
[33:55.18]I'm just going to T-pose over here to make sure this doesn't happen.
[34:08.31]There you go.
[34:08.63]No, no, no, no.
[34:10.97]A little more, a little more, a little more.
[34:11.95]You're going too far.
[34:13.83]You're going too far.
[34:14.71]I think that's good.
[34:19.17]Don't listen to me, though.
[34:20.45]I'm a liar.
[34:24.54]No, not enough.
[34:27.28]Well, I like collecting rings.
[34:28.46]By the way, you win this.
[34:42.70]This is what you win.
[34:44.64]It's fallen.
[34:45.10]It's gotten rolled all over the ground.
[34:46.24]It's a goat.
[34:46.92]It's a prize.
[34:47.64]That's what you're looking for.
[34:48.46]You just got to get one.
[34:51.90]I would laugh so hard if this is not even one.
[34:53.74]It would be great.
[34:55.78]It would prove just my total superiority.
[34:58.08]Let's try it again.
[35:07.79]Fuck.
[35:10.25]Ah!
[35:12.20]Too much.
[35:14.48]You guys go too far or too little.
[35:17.14]You gotta go like that sweet spot and you gotta try to hit it right in the middle.
[35:21.12]So bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, land.
[35:23.99]And even if it doesn't, it's hard to do, you know?
[35:26.25]It's hard to do.
[35:28.57]Pay no attention to the guy that's putting his hand in here.
[35:31.39]Remember, this is just to teach you how this works.
[35:35.30]What did I do?
[35:36.16]I think I fucked something up.
[35:38.32]This is a lesson because there are six more games
[35:41.34]coming up here after this.
[35:43.58]This is the tutorial.
[35:45.18]And you failed the tutorial.
[35:46.26]You know how you guys give me shit all the time for messing up tutorials?
[35:50.79]You guys failed it.
[35:53.05]I was really thinking you were going to get at least one.
[35:56.21]Go back and redo the tutorial.
[36:01.57]See?
[36:02.99]See?
[36:03.27]I just did it.
[36:05.63]It's really not that hard.
[36:06.37]You have to do it like 60 or 70 times in a row with varying degrees and angles.
[36:14.90]I think this will be the one.
[36:18.38]I think you're going to go harder than that.
[36:19.46]Remember, it's a mallet that is dropping.
[36:21.79]You're pulling the mallet back to land on the platform to launch the ring.
[36:26.43]So use the force that is there, Luke.
[36:29.23]God damn it.
[36:35.19]Unfortunately, you still can't get it.
[36:37.73]By this point, you guys have already spent probably, like, four or five hundred dollars on this.
[36:42.32]And that goes directly to me.
[36:44.48]That goes directly to me.
[36:50.08]So, I'm gonna give you guys... I'm gonna give you guys a shotgun here.
[36:55.41]Can you shotgun blast this and land on one?
[36:58.55]We've got, like, five rings loaded up, and then you're gonna have to move on.
[37:01.87]It's just you guys can't do it.
[37:03.17]It's very evident, you know?
[37:04.13]Come on.
[37:05.55]We see if we can shot, that's gonna hit me.
[37:06.91]I should probably back up.
[37:09.17]Should I even be in here?
[37:10.51]I'm not sure I should be in here.
[37:16.06]I don't think I should be over here.
[37:17.48]I'm gonna get hit in the eye.
[37:22.44]Can you get one?
[37:22.98]I don't think it's gonna happen.
[37:30.43]Why am I squinting?
[37:35.65]Honestly, it doesn't matter where you put it.
[37:37.21]It's just going to go.
[37:38.53]Oh, shit.
[37:45.47]Not even fucking close.
[37:48.26]Not even close.
[37:50.72]You failed the first game.
[37:52.64]You can't even do the first game.
[37:54.78]Well, alright.
[37:56.64]So what's going to happen here is I'm sorry you don't win this.
[38:01.08]I don't even know where that went.
[38:02.00]Who cares?
[38:02.48]What we're gonna do now is I'm gonna give you guys a special little treat here.
[38:07.93]I'm gonna give you guys a little treat.
[38:10.23]We're gonna move on.
[38:16.73]What kind of carnival exists without, of course, some delicious, nutritious,
[38:29.33]potentially illness causing bacteria infested cotton candy that's right and I I mean I'm gonna need somebody one of you guys one of the people in the chat are gonna have to come up here does anybody does anybody want any cotton candy you'd like something son you over there why don't you come on over here son I am gonna make you a special treat
[38:56.15]I have trained in this, son.
[38:58.45]Is this your brother?
[39:00.86]Daniel?
[39:01.52]Daniel.
[39:01.90]Good to see you.
[39:03.14]So I have trained in the art of making cotton candy.
[39:10.91]And I can't.
[39:12.95]I hope it's just fucking shallow.
[39:18.19]Oh, shit.
[39:19.11]OK.
[39:22.36]Alright, so everything is good to go.
[39:24.94]How big do you want it, son?
[39:28.54]How big?
[39:28.88]You want it big?
[39:30.12]I can do that for you.
[39:31.72]All you can hear is probably a loud noise.
[39:38.06]Does mom want one too?
[39:43.69]Alright, I have actually been trained in this.
[39:46.53]Let's get a good, nice, big cotton candy surprise for you.
[39:54.95]This is not what I thought was gonna happen.
[39:58.25]Alright, I'm not very good.
[40:00.90]I'll get a big one for you and your brother.
[40:08.04]I have no fucking idea how to do this.
[40:10.56]I read the instructions very, very quickly.
[40:17.91]This thing's going to fly off into outer space.
[40:22.35]Okay.
[40:23.09]Well, hey.
[40:24.27]There you go.
[40:26.23]There you go.
[40:27.94]There you go, son.
[40:29.36]This one's for you.
[40:30.30]There you go.
[40:31.38]Take it.
[40:31.76]There you go.
[40:32.22]Jermavetus!
[40:35.80]Jesus Christ.
[40:37.18]Hawkjump!
[40:38.30]Alright.
[40:38.56]Go home.
[40:40.12]Do you want one, too?
[40:44.03]Would you like one, too?
[40:45.01]Would your brother...
[40:47.55]I'm going to get like burnt.
[40:49.07]No, no, no, no.
[40:50.67]Don't do that.
[41:01.06]Just like mom used to make.
[41:03.12]Alright.
[41:05.74]Just like mom used to make.
[41:13.02]I taste soap.
[41:14.14]I don't know why.
[41:19.34]It tastes soapy to me.
[41:23.51]I can't believe you fucking... It's delicious.
[41:31.01]Hold on, let me get some more.
[41:38.76]Here we go.
[41:42.40]Okay.
[41:42.80]Well, I'm going to give you a double there, son, if you would like to take that.
[41:54.16]That's like a bug zapper.
[42:01.26]Alright.
[42:02.98]Look at that.
[42:07.11]Imagine you got this at the carnival.
[42:09.69]I'd be like, I would fucking return it.
[42:11.97]Can you return cotton candy?
[42:16.99]That's like so shitty.
[42:18.81]That's so bad.
[42:23.91]Oh God, this is bad.
[42:26.53]This is bad.
[42:27.53]No, this is not an injury.
[42:28.55]Come here, come here.
[42:30.19]Bring your brother too, come here.
[42:31.63]This is not an injury.
[42:33.19]People think I got like a cut.
[42:35.27]No, it's cotton candy.
[42:37.53]Relax, it's gonna be fine.
[42:43.09]Alright, that looks good.
[42:46.51]I'm gonna need a shower after this, I think.
[42:54.07]That probably looks disgusting.
[42:55.81]I don't know if you can hear anything I'm saying right now because there's a loud machine over here.
[42:59.79]So coming up next, there's all this more.
[43:03.03]There's more, this ain't it.
[43:06.26]Spent $645 million on this fucking project.
[43:08.62]I don't know if I should turn it off.
[43:13.10]Coming up next is, what do we got next?
[43:17.46]That's a good question.
[43:18.24]I'm gonna have to take this off.
[43:21.22]Oh, what a great like fucking joke.
[43:24.09]I made shitty cotton candy for five minutes.
[43:27.15]Wonderful.
[43:29.07]Don't put your hand in here, by the way.
[43:30.41]That's dangerous.
[43:32.13]Like I'm doing.
[43:32.69]I'm a professional.
[43:33.97]There's like 15 people on staff here that taught me how to do this.
[43:37.59]Don't worry.
[43:39.77]Actually pretty good.
[43:45.63]Where are we going next?
[43:47.78]We are going to another game.
[43:50.99]That game is, I've forgotten the game.
[43:54.27]Tell me what it is in my ear, because I don't fucking remember.
[43:56.64]I swear.
[44:00.78]We're going to frog launch.
[44:03.06]Launching frogs.
[44:04.82]I'll see you over there.
[44:14.90]I can't.
[44:15.44]I got.
[44:21.32]Alright, so in this game, this is another hard one.
[44:26.96]We've updated the graphics because they were incorrect on the last one.
[44:30.57]So the graphics have been updated.
[44:33.63]I'm going to need like a cup of water if it's possible.
[44:36.23]Actually, it'll probably help you because these things are probably going to stick.
[44:41.61]So we have... Hold on.
[44:46.67]I'm just going to put it over here.
[44:50.00]We have these frogs, as you know, frogs are here.
[44:53.64]Your goal is to land these on the lily pads.
[44:58.15]You remember this one from when you were a kid?
[45:00.09]I do.
[45:00.95]So if you land on a lily pad, you win.
[45:05.87]If not, then you lose.
[45:08.24]So this one is probably going to be like five times harder than the last one.
[45:13.61]So I would be surprised again if anybody got this at all.
[45:18.03]I mean, these, the first couple are just like impossible.
[45:20.97]And I thought it would be kind of funny if we made the games like just fucking uncompletable.
[45:24.95]But then out of a thank you, sir.
[45:27.64]Thank you.
[45:27.96]If you could just dump that on my hands, that would be wonderful.
[45:30.92]Alright.
[45:31.30]There we go.
[45:31.88]Just a little bit of you taping that.
[45:33.64]Okay.
[45:34.22]Not sure why you filmed that.
[45:36.69]I'm not sure why you had to get that on camera, but I had to have that happen.
[45:40.51]Anyway, so you gotta land the frogs on the lily pads.
[45:42.71]The controls have been updated.
[45:43.57]They may have been incorrect before, but it's a live goddamn show, okay?
[45:48.44]This is all happening live right now.
[45:50.66]And you haven't seen anything like this before.
[45:52.76]I've never seen... Okay, we're good.
[45:58.33]We're good.
[45:58.81]The ground just moved.
[46:00.15]So...
[46:01.44]Again, you have the controls on the screen.
[46:03.44]You're launching the frogs.
[46:04.28]Land on a lily pad.
[46:04.90]If you land on a lily pad, the game ends, by the way.
[46:07.58]You win the game.
[46:09.34]Good luck.
[46:09.62]You're going to need it, because we've actually tested this like a dozen times.
[46:14.41]And I don't think anyone has been able to do this once.
[46:16.91]Back to back, we're giving you hard ones.
[46:18.77]This is the new one of the hard mode.
[46:20.61]You've got it.
[46:21.67]Watch the timer on the screen.
[46:22.65]Chat, commands are only accepted at the green light.
[46:27.70]You've got to get that frog on a lily pad.
[46:31.07]And hopefully in the air, too.
[46:36.91]Fucking cotton candy.
[46:38.78]That was such a waste of time.
[46:42.30]It actually was not that bad.
[46:43.26]It did taste a little bit like soap, but of course, hit the streamer.
[46:47.82]I won't move.
[46:48.32]It'll hit me right in the face.
[46:49.40]It'll hit me directly in the face.
[46:52.02]I don't care.
[46:52.34]Do it.
[46:53.74]Come on.
[46:56.56]Come on, do it.
[46:58.28]You want to make that joke so bad.
[47:00.72]And you actually did it.
[47:02.48]I actually can't fucking believe you did that.
[47:20.77]I mean, did it hurt?
[47:21.53]Yeah.
[47:22.21]Am I going to cry about it?
[47:23.11]No.
[47:24.53]Maybe not.
[47:29.49]That was a direct fucking hit.
[47:34.03]Un-fucking-believable.
[47:35.17]Anyways, now if you could, could you play the actual game?
[47:37.87]That would be fantastic.
[47:42.36]Come on!
[47:43.84]You gotta land on a lily pad!
[47:48.78]Ooh!
[47:51.24]Too much.
[47:52.28]Too much.
[47:53.75]I got some for you here if you need them.
[47:55.63]You got enough back there?
[47:56.31]I'll just toss them in the box.
[47:58.49]I'll toss them in the box when I get them.
[47:59.79]Oh God.
[48:03.30]Wind, you're ruining my whole show.
[48:07.00]Hey, let me show you how easy this is.
[48:12.15]Pretty easy.
[48:15.55]We thought it was going to rain.
[48:16.87]You understand?
[48:17.77]So like, I'm not sure what's worse.
[48:20.06]If it rains, then the whole thing has to be canceled.
[48:22.58]But if it's wind, then you have to compensate for the wind like a golfer.
[48:26.63]You ever play golf?
[48:27.25]You go to the driving range, you have to compensate for the wind?
[48:30.19]You have to do that here.
[48:31.15]I'll give you a good example.
[48:32.15]I'll throw it in the air so you can see.
[48:33.89]See, there you go.
[48:34.45]The wind's going that way.
[48:35.23]Just so you know, the wind's going that way.
[48:36.85]And it's on the bot now.
[48:40.36]You have a... That scared me.
[48:43.02]I got actually startled.
[48:46.10]I actually just got scared by that, so...
[48:54.20]It's coming up all over the place.
[48:57.10]Oh, we got rings, we got frogs.
[49:01.14]It is possible, as you see.
[49:02.36]I thought, fuck, I forgot to prove that.
[49:03.70]I'm supposed to prove that it's a possible game.
[49:06.28]This is, by the way, it's too hot out here.
[49:08.28]It's time for me to de-robe and just be in my fucked up train conductor outfit.
[49:16.93]Okay, that's not gonna be the, okay, that's good.
[49:18.85]I don't want to show the whole fucking Blue Man shirt.
[49:20.97]Wait, oh, I think I just ripped out my mic.
[49:23.49]Can production staff still hear me?
[49:26.41]Can you still hear me?
[49:28.44]I think I may have ripped the mic up.
[49:29.44]Okay, good.
[49:30.42]You guys can hear me.
[49:31.06]Okay, let me help you.
[49:33.80]Too high.
[49:36.32]You gotta find that spot.
[49:37.46]If you guys find a spot that lands on the table, if you find a spot on the table, you wanna try to keep it there.
[49:45.36]You guys are moving it too much.
[49:50.35]I should put my head down there.
[49:54.38]I should put my face down there so you guys actually do it.
[50:01.10]Oh shit, I forgot.
[50:03.03]That's too easy.
[50:08.65]Right in the middle.
[50:15.23]Good, good, good.
[50:17.75]Good.
[50:19.25]Good, more, more, more power.
[50:21.77]More power.
[50:23.85]Oh!
[50:27.37]If I were you, I would aim for the bigger ones because, I mean, these are smaller.
[50:34.53]If you go to the carnival, they're going to try to get you to throw it on the smaller ones.
[50:37.80]Use your thinking phases.
[50:38.74]Use your 6,000 IQ.
[50:39.94]Put it on the big one.
[50:45.90]These don't count, by the way, these frogs.
[50:47.88]They're just there for fun and to squeak when I need to.
[50:50.20]Like that.
[50:52.84]See?
[50:53.74]You want to get them all?
[50:54.52]I'll do them all.
[50:56.26]One more?
[50:59.09]This one sucks.
[51:02.69]Replace him.
[51:04.47]He's not good enough on camera.
[51:08.83]Alright.
[51:11.82]Is it going to be enough?
[51:22.24]Almost at it.
[51:23.94]That was right there.
[51:27.16]Almost there.
[51:29.62]You had an opportunity.
[51:33.40]I wonder if you guys are gonna be able to do any of these.
[51:36.55]I bet you, I bet you don't do one.
[51:40.27]And by the way, the dunk tank is coming up, so good luck with that one.
[51:43.51]I don't think you're gonna be able to do that one either.
[51:46.25]I hope you proved me wrong today.
[51:47.25]I can't believe.
[51:57.28]Oh, by the way, if it bounces and lands, it counts.
[52:00.07]That does count.
[52:01.53]If we go from here to here, you just have to land on it.
[52:04.45]It counts.
[52:11.13]It is really hard, though.
[52:13.23]When we were thinking about these games, and we were designing them, and we were going back and forth with Andy Mark, we were trying to figure out, like, hey, what can we do?
[52:19.47]We don't want them just to win immediately.
[52:21.55]Because that's what I mean.
[52:26.10]Hi, I see, yeah, I know, I know.
[52:27.49]You're gonna go for it again?
[52:28.29]I won't move.
[52:29.41]You think I'm scared?
[52:30.87]No.
[52:33.57]Have you realized that you can't win?
[52:34.74]You're just gonna, okay.
[52:40.34]I may have just cheated.
[52:47.54]That was getting close, but I may have just influenced that a little.
[52:51.60]Now, that was right here.
[52:52.74]It was going right here.
[52:55.30]Don't even give me that bullshit.
[52:59.05]Can I take this hat off yet?
[52:59.93]It makes me look like a dickhead.
[53:04.31]No, that's worse.
[53:05.79]That's worse.
[53:08.07]I think it might be worse.
[53:11.99]This is like don't don't like invite me anywhere.
[53:13.91]Like this is like a scary person.
[53:16.39]What's worse this?
[53:21.19]I'm using the production monitor as a mirror.
[53:23.25]That's how much of a vain fuck I am.
[53:25.98]Oh I'm paying attention to the game.
[53:30.36]I'm like, what do I look like right now?
[53:33.80]Do I look okay?
[53:35.08]Let me see.
[53:36.04]Okay.
[53:36.44]Nice.
[53:38.25]What's that?
[53:39.17]What's that, yeah?
[53:40.54]What's that?
[53:40.82]Yeah, OK.
[53:41.44]I got you.
[53:41.94]Roger that.
[53:47.30]I'm not fucking bald.
[53:48.22]I see it.
[53:48.58]I can see the emotes right now.
[53:50.08]Cut that out, or I'll fucking ban you.
[53:52.68]You want to get banned from the carnival?
[53:53.98]There's two ways to get banned from a carnival.
[53:55.98]One is to puke on a ride.
[53:58.22]And two is by riding the ride too many times in a row, because they get sick of you.
[54:03.81]And they'll just tell you to leave.
[54:05.48]I know this because I did it.
[54:06.82]I didn't puke on a ride.
[54:08.30]I rode a ride too many times in a row because I bought like 150 tickets.
[54:15.18]And they're just like, dude, you can't do this like fucking 20 times in a row.
[54:17.74]So I was like, alright, fine.
[54:20.88]So I left.
[54:21.26]I was just getting back.
[54:25.29]They were sick of seeing me.
[54:27.99]They thought I stole them, all the tickets.
[54:29.87]And I'm like, I didn't fucking do that.
[54:31.77]I paid good money for this.
[54:34.74]I don't want to influence that.
[54:35.52]I'll take it off.
[54:39.91]Something going on that way.
[54:46.27]You guys seem to have figured out the controls, though.
[54:49.51]I like that.
[54:52.63]You got to go for the middle ones.
[54:54.31]Have you done?
[54:56.73]Ah, no, no, no.
[55:00.43]No, that's safe in baseball.
[55:02.65]You're out.
[55:04.45]You can get a photo of it if you want.
[55:05.65]Get a photo of it, because that's no.
[55:10.21]The foot don't count.
[55:10.91]No, you got to get the whole thing on.
[55:11.96]That doesn't count.
[55:14.14]It's got to be on the actual pad itself.
[55:16.48]That don't count.
[55:20.72]That doesn't get you anything.
[55:22.79]That gets you a nice try, not a hole.
[55:30.06]It's not rigged.
[55:31.00]It's not.
[55:32.00]It's not rigged.
[55:33.09]Where have you ever been to a carnival before?
[55:34.69]And it was... I know you... Oh, like, aim at him now.
[55:36.69]No.
[55:37.15]I know you've never been to a carnival, but I have.
[55:40.41]No, a shitload of you.
[55:41.13]Everyone's been to a carnival.
[55:41.87]How have you not been to a carnival?
[55:43.51]I mean, I'm projecting on you.
[55:44.69]I don't know why.
[55:46.05]Everybody that's been to a carnival knows you have to get it.
[55:49.21]There's a very specific area you have to get it on.
[55:56.98]That don't count.
[55:58.10]You didn't win shit.
[56:00.78]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what are you guys pretending?
[56:03.92]Are you guys pretending?
[56:06.26]Huh?
[56:08.23]Stop pretending, chat.
[56:10.25]Right?
[56:11.13]Stop pretending.
[56:12.89]You're doing this hard thing that's really hard to do and you can't do it?
[56:18.63]Stop fucking pretending, chat.
[56:20.49]You know what I'm saying?
[56:23.07]Quit pretending.
[56:26.67]Let's go.
[56:27.87]Get it done now.
[56:35.46]Oops.
[56:51.07]Double.
[56:52.47]Not enough.
[56:54.31]Didn't count.
[57:03.48]I love this so much.
[57:05.06]This is amazing.
[57:08.06]I love watching you guys try to do something, and you can't do it.
[57:11.66]And I just get to sit here.
[57:12.68]I get to be the backseat gamer, because I know how to do this.
[57:15.90]And I just get to watch you guys fail over and over again.
[57:18.70]I get to watch you guys suffer through Dark Souls 3, which I beat on stream.
[57:23.96]I did the DLC, too, if you weren't curious.
[57:25.50]Some of the new viewers that don't know that I beat it on stream.
[57:29.32]I played Demon's Souls.
[57:30.47]I beat it on stream.
[57:32.33]beat Demon's Souls on stream for me.
[57:34.05]Come on, let's go.
[57:43.94]That jumped up and then fell.
[57:51.46]We're gonna leave that there so we can, we'll get a referee to verify that.
[57:56.06]Who's been, by the way, completely independent of anything going on here that I have hired.
[58:03.56]So completely independent third-party reviewer that I have brought on to I've hired so By the way It's me Do it I know you can I'm certain you guys can
[58:25.80]Right in the middle.
[58:26.64]Right in the middle.
[58:27.38]You got to up, down.
[58:29.32]Pull it back a little bit.
[58:30.50]Work together on this shit.
[58:32.25]Work together on this.
[58:34.01]You were right here.
[58:35.19]You were literally right here.
[58:36.59]Now just pull it back.
[58:38.13]Don't even move the fucking thing.
[58:39.45]Just pull it back like a little bit of power.
[58:41.91]Pull the mat.
[58:42.35]Don't go forward.
[58:44.57]You've got it.
[58:46.19]Work together.
[58:49.57]There you go.
[58:50.09]There you go.
[58:51.79]No, no, no.
[58:52.45]Don't move it.
[58:53.25]Don't turn it.
[58:56.35]Somebody fucked it up.
[58:57.07]Who did it?
[58:58.57]Who screwed that up?
[59:03.85]I did.
[59:04.17]Me.
[59:04.39]It was me.
[59:04.82]I did.
[59:05.20]I did.
[59:05.52]It was me.
[59:13.30]Too much.
[59:13.98]Way too much.
[59:14.92]You had it right there.
[59:15.66]You just had to pull it back a little bit.
[59:17.33]And I think there might be some pranksters in the chat.
[59:20.27]There might be some people joking around too much.
[59:23.31]No, it was right here.
[59:24.09]Now I move this way.
[59:25.78]You had it.
[59:27.16]Blame the people in chat that didn't follow along.
[59:31.98]That's what I blame.
[59:34.07]No, that's just extra cotton candy.
[59:35.17]I don't have a cut on my arm, don't worry.
[59:37.63]I have to get this off, I hate it.
[59:39.57]I just saw it over here and I was like, get that fucking thing off my head.
[59:44.34]I look like one of those guys that goes in like surveys.
[59:47.30]This is seriously like a traffic cough shirt.
[59:50.30]I can't take it off though because my mic is hooked into it.
[59:52.28]So I can't take it off.
[59:52.91]I have to look like this for like at least another 30 minutes.
[59:56.41]By the way, look at the glue man shirt.
[59:57.39]That's available.
[59:59.39]Nope, no, no, no, no, no.
[60:02.91]It doesn't count.
[60:03.63]You guys got the feet.
[60:04.43]You got two feet.
[60:06.81]No, does not count.
[60:11.69]If you guys can't...
[60:15.65]No, it doesn't count.
[60:18.45]It needs to land.
[60:19.19]It has to be on the pad.
[60:22.12]Not kind of on the pad.
[60:23.32]You guys get it together.
[60:28.16]I'll leave it, but I'm not going to count it.
[60:30.42]Why would I do that?
[60:33.56]And now the juggling of Jerma at five.
[60:35.80]I have no idea how to do that.
[60:44.67]You guys got to go higher than that.
[60:45.49]It's too low.
[60:47.35]Although it's not my game, so that's not me playing.
[60:55.53]Come on.
[61:01.59]I want you guys to win.
[61:02.79]I do.
[61:03.13]I want you to win so bad.
[61:06.17]I am so desperate for you to win.
[61:08.64]Because if you don't win any, there's no fun.
[61:11.66]Just keep going until you just do it.
[61:14.98]You have it in the right area.
[61:17.60]I know you're completely capable of it.
[61:20.32]So come, do it.
[61:23.46]I know you, look.
[61:25.90]The wind is going this way.
[61:32.18]Do it.
[61:33.80]I have complete faith.
[61:37.22]No, more.
[61:38.38]Pull it back.
[61:40.58]I'm just trying to help you.
[61:41.44]That's it.
[61:42.10]Because I'm seeing this, the complete death.
[61:45.50]That actually was pretty close.
[61:47.55]That was close.
[61:50.22]All these are so close, but so far, to a point where there's
[61:58.89]I don't think it's gonna happen.
[62:00.23]I'm pretty sure you guys can't do the first.
[62:02.13]These launching games are the hardest ones, probably.
[62:04.25]That's why they're first.
[62:06.32]It's like a training thing.
[62:07.76]I'm trying to... I'm trying... I'm the only one holding this.
[62:11.32]I'm trying to train you to win the fucking carnival game, and at the same time, I'm training to hold this before it falls down and crushes me.
[62:21.88]Whichever one of those two things happens first, we'll find out, won't we?
[62:30.78]Same spot.
[62:32.42]Same spot as the yellow one.
[62:41.90]How much is it usually to do this?
[62:43.99]Like five bucks.
[62:46.19]What did you get?
[62:46.63]Like three tosses for like $3, $4, something like that.
[62:50.43]I think it's something like that.
[62:52.01]Was it like $5 for three tosses, three bucks for two tosses usually.
[62:59.37]Oh, this is a different style here.
[63:00.53]You guys are going for a different style.
[63:06.01]This is the one.
[63:06.89]I'm calling it right now.
[63:09.73]Once that time hits zero, what's going on?
[63:12.26]I'm certain of it.
[63:14.26]Don't let me down.
[63:17.96]Don't let me down right now.
[63:29.70]You had a chance.
[63:33.75]We are going to do this only a few more times before you guys have to get thrown out of the carnival here because of what?
[63:41.85]There's a line behind you.
[63:44.71]Only a couple more times.
[63:45.69]You guys have a line forming behind you.
[63:47.73]You can't just hog it.
[63:54.27]It is not completable.
[63:55.69]Rigged just like a real carnival.
[63:59.16]Just like the real one.
[64:02.46]If you hit it, you get something great.
[64:05.23]I just want to, I'm going to put that out there.
[64:08.05]They got one.
[64:09.27]They got one.
[64:12.57]They did it!
[64:13.89]They got one!
[64:15.41]You actually did it.
[64:17.87]And of course, if you win, you get a prize.
[64:25.88]And hey.
[64:27.72]How's this for a prize?
[64:30.28]How's that for a fucking prize, huh?
[64:33.40]You like that one?
[64:35.80]What I have here is some kind of animal.
[64:39.49]Some kind of teeth animal.
[64:42.85]Big brinner.
[64:43.45]I think it's a Pokémon character.
[64:53.61]You'll get it later.
[64:55.67]You did it!
[64:57.15]Actually, I probably shouldn't, that's gonna get dirty.
[64:59.77]Do you want to know something funny about that prize?
[65:01.15]Now, by the way, that's for you, but it's for me.
[65:06.33]That thing's like a hundred bucks.
[65:08.79]Why?
[65:10.09]Why the fuck is that thing, I can't believe you did it.
[65:12.65]I was getting kind of concerned though.
[65:15.83]After the first one, and the wind and everything, I'm just sitting here going, I don't, I don't, they're not gonna do this.
[65:21.11]This is gonna be impossible.
[65:22.49]But you actually did it, and in fact I have to inspect this because, wait a minute.
[65:27.52]It's not on there all the way, I don't think that actually counts.
[65:31.26]I'm not going to touch it, because one of you wants to.
[65:32.86]No, it does.
[65:33.48]It does.
[65:33.96]I'll count it.
[65:34.36]I'll count it.
[65:36.28]I don't want to stifle your victory here.
[65:40.43]So Wailord is your prize.
[65:42.49]It's going in my office.
[65:43.87]I'm going to hang it up behind a door or something.
[65:46.27]I don't know.
[65:47.23]I'm actually surprised that these things all stayed.
[65:51.73]What we should have done is we should have said, if you got four feet, then you get a prize.
[65:57.85]Good work.
[65:58.35]You actually, actually did it.
[65:59.93]I'm so happy about that.
[66:01.31]Can I touch this now?
[66:02.93]Can I put my hands on this?
[66:04.95]Can I?
[66:05.49]OK.
[66:06.49]Get your photo.
[66:10.20]Give me this thing.
[66:11.68]Give me this thing.
[66:13.54]Alright.
[66:14.38]I got those.
[66:14.98]I'll leave that.
[66:15.88]Should I not touch it?
[66:16.44]What are you saying?
[66:19.95]What did you say?
[66:20.31]Oh, you're taking photos.
[66:21.09]Alright, good.
[66:21.73]That's a good idea.
[66:22.83]I see all the you took a picture JPEGs, whatever they are.
[66:28.41]But I have something here for you guys that's incredibly special.
[66:35.10]We're going to move on to something else.
[66:36.88]This is not a game.
[66:38.82]Please, please give an incredibly warm welcome to the amusings of Cuddles and Paulie Polite.
[66:51.83]Molly, come on in and join me, won't you?
[66:53.43]Come on in.
[66:54.87]Oh, yeah.
[66:55.27]Come on in where you can sit right down.
[66:58.40]Cuddles!

[67:14.75]Can I make a balloon for you?
[67:16.89]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[67:21.50]I want a dog.
[67:22.58]Can I have a dog?
[67:23.80]You can have a dog.
[67:24.54]Alright, I'll make a little dog for you.
[67:27.36]I love you, dog.
[67:29.33]I will, I can do that, you know.
[67:31.55]I make top legs and back legs.
[67:34.59]Hello there, little puppy.
[67:35.75]Whoa.
[67:36.91]Yeah, here we go.
[67:40.08]Whoa.
[67:42.94]Ah.
[67:45.16]No.
[67:47.56]Oh, yeah.
[67:48.26]Whoa.
[67:49.88]I'm going to fix it.
[67:51.01]You watch over.
[67:51.67]I can fix it.
[67:52.37]I can fix it.
[67:52.93]I'm watching.
[67:53.41]I'm watching.
[67:53.89]Whoa, yeah.
[67:54.57]Come on, come on, come on.
[67:56.65]Boop.
[68:00.58]I know what I want!
[68:04.37]What?

[70:54.40]That could be a weenie dog.
[70:56.08]It's not a weenie dog.
[70:57.72]It's going to be Old Yeller.
[70:59.96]I'm talking about that new one.
[71:03.06]And the purple one, that's a hound dog.
[71:06.42]Maybe a Yorkie, huh?
[71:07.46]Yorkies are popular.
[71:10.70]A yellow dog cuddles.
[71:13.14]That's gonna be old yellow, yeah.
[71:15.38]Hang on there.
[71:16.06]Stay right there, stay.
[71:31.91]I'm waiting.

[73:03.25]You got a lot of babies going on there, Mom.
[73:20.68]I don't know, but I think it's going to be O' Yeller.
[73:24.50]O' Yeller's got too many legs.
[73:26.46]He's got four.
[73:27.34]That is a leg, right?
[73:28.82]How many legs have you got?
[73:29.62]Yes.
[73:30.98]What?
[73:31.56]Right.
[73:32.34]The only one I know that has more legs is you.
[73:34.54]Look at that.
[73:35.30]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[73:37.77]I have lots of legs right here.
[73:39.73]Right here.
[73:40.25]Are you making fun of my dog?
[73:42.49]No.
[73:43.11]I think he's pretty.
[73:46.64]You want that one back?
[73:47.92]You're an Indian giver.
[73:50.40]Okay, okay, okay.
[73:55.31]Can I have my yellow dog now?
[73:57.69]Thank you very much.
[74:00.15]Good.
[74:05.63]I'm going to take my dogs out.
[74:07.81]Thank you, Cuddles.
[74:09.11]Okay, well, that's the way home.
[74:12.35]Bye, Cuddles.
[74:13.49]Bye.
[74:13.93]You're very welcome.
[74:15.39]Okay, bye.
[74:29.25]Fully polite.
[74:31.17]Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful clowns.
[74:33.15]We got them.
[74:34.11]Oh, you didn't think they were going to be?
[74:35.09]Of course they were.
[74:35.73]You didn't think I was going to have something without clowns?
[74:39.52]Are you out of your mind?
[74:40.56]Anyways, this is it right here behind me.
[74:42.90]I know I got my hair in front of my face.
[74:44.96]This is Dunk Tank.
[74:48.77]So what's going to happen here, very important.
[74:53.07]You have to shoot this thing here while I'm sitting up there.
[74:57.65]And maybe you dunk me, maybe you don't.
[74:59.25]I don't know, we'll see.
[75:00.87]This is the idea that I had two or three years ago.
[75:05.74]And I can't, I'm ecstatic.
[75:07.64]I'm so excited to get up there because I, this is the main event here.
[75:12.74]This is what I did this for.
[75:14.46]And we've got a new robot in play here.
[75:17.81]This is the pitching machine robot.
[75:19.99]It is loaded.
[75:21.17]It is dangerous.
[75:23.37]Do not, under any circumstances, I'm going to make this very clear, do not fire at me.
[75:29.84]That's no, okay.
[75:30.88]Do not.
[75:31.80]Not okay.
[75:32.92]Do not fire at anything besides the red circle over there on the right side.
[75:37.60]Okay?
[75:38.20]You have my understanding?
[75:39.43]Good.
[75:39.93]Great.
[75:40.27]Can't wait for you to break that rule in about 15 seconds.
[75:42.57]Anyways, I'm going to get up there.
[75:45.59]Good luck.
[75:46.67]Because I don't think you got what it takes.
[75:49.15]You bastards.
[75:50.71]Was that good?
[75:51.35]Did I call them bastards?
[75:52.40]Was that good?
[75:52.94]Okay, good.
[76:12.58]So, if you've ever been to the carnival before, I'm not sure which camera I'm looking at here, you got one chance the same exact rules are in place.
[76:24.98]Wait for the timer
[76:27.52]to get down to zero, and then it's gonna fire wherever it fires.
[76:31.59]I'm actually a little bit nervous about this, because I'm excited, but, and yes, I am wearing jeans.
[76:36.23]That's to cover an area that it may have been, I don't want you to see.
[76:41.41]You understand, I got shorts on too.
[76:43.37]So anybody that's typing O-W-O in the chat right now, it's not gonna work, because I've got like four pairs of underwear on, and now I'm gonna leave it at that.
[76:51.18]That's where I'm gonna leave it.

[78:06.29]Those of you that don't think this is real, there's real water in here.
[78:08.65]You can hear it swirling.
[78:14.23]I don't want to pop this because it's going to make a loud noise in here.
[78:19.81]This wind is scaring the shit out of me.
[78:26.63]Good luck.
[78:27.77]I wish you the best of luck.
[78:30.75]Why am I nervous up here?

[78:39.34]That's not fun.
[78:40.34]I don't like that.
[78:41.58]I don't want to go through with that.
[78:43.97]Now, yes, I'm stalling.
[78:45.21]That's what I'm doing right now.
[78:46.33]You figured it out.
[78:48.51]The 15, 16, 20, whatever thousand people are here.

[79:20.40]You're aiming for there.
[79:22.08]You're aiming at the circle.
[79:26.80]At the circle.

[80:28.45]I'm actually concerned that if you aim high enough you're gonna hit me right in the fucking eyes.
[80:33.63]I'm gonna have to duck.
[80:38.19]There should be enough protection here.
[80:39.75]Make sure I'm in the right place.

[83:22.40]That should be it, right?
[83:26.07]Yeah.
[83:28.17]I think I lined it up.
[83:31.47]I should say, I should say, fuck you, streamer.
[83:33.23]That makes sense.
[83:36.03]You guys are not paying attention.
[83:37.17]You know, listen.
[83:42.69]This thing, by the way, this thing feels real new.
[83:46.17]Can I just tell you, this is a new laptop.

[83:54.40]It's got a Celeron, Intel Celeron, whatever fucking denomination they have.
[84:02.00]22, two gigahertz, I don't know.
[84:07.30]How bad would it be if for some fucking reason,
[84:11.87]I was on the computer and we were somehow... What an expensive piece of technology the streamer is using.
[84:22.84]Let me help you get the dunk.
[84:24.12]Oh, how bad would it be?
[84:28.68]Something fell.
[84:31.27]I don't know what it was.
[84:33.01]I have no idea what it was.
[84:34.11]I can't even.
[84:40.49]Whoa, wait, woo!
[84:42.03]You know what I love to do?
[84:42.75]I love to just like toss stuff that's expensive.

[84:57.10]How long is that joke gonna go on for?
[84:58.88]Let's find out.
[85:00.66]What, 20 more seconds, 30 more seconds?
[85:03.10]Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and fire, bud.
[85:06.80]Make it real easy for you.
[85:16.40]It's gone.
[85:17.52]It's gone.
[85:18.12]I can't even... Well!

[85:37.41]Let me get in my computer.
[85:42.54]Use my ex- Did I mention how expensive this laptop was?
[85:45.96]Did I ex- Did I explain that?
[85:46.60]Did I explain- Fuck.
[85:47.78]At this point, I heard there was going to be a little bit of rain.
[86:00.51]Oh, shit!
[86:01.61]Oh, that fucking- That got me.
[86:04.07]That got me.

[86:07.09]Oh, it actually did.
[86:07.79]That- Of all- Honestly-
[86:11.58]Of all the fucking things that injure me on this stream, I... That actually cut my hand.
[86:22.70]Of all the things, this like hurt me.
[86:28.77]The tiny umbrella is the thing that gives me like a welt on my hand.
[86:36.65]Bring it back on the computer.
[86:48.91]This has been tested, right?
[86:50.77]I think so.
[86:53.01]Down.
[86:53.41]Bring it down.
[86:54.13]Bring it down.
[86:54.75]Oh, god damn it.
[87:06.03]Don't, please.
[87:10.53]You fuckers.
[87:15.01]Kill the broadcast.
[87:16.81]End the stream.
[87:17.55]They aimed at the gate.
[87:19.31]That is not alright.
[87:21.40]Let me get back on my computer.
[87:22.84]I can't believe that little umbrella.
[87:29.54]We have machines here that are firing at me.
[87:32.88]And I get my hand pinched by a fucking baby umbrella.
[87:36.46]That hurts me.
[87:37.31]That's unbelievable.
[87:39.79]What a joke.
[87:43.63]Get it!
[87:45.60]Get it so I can put the laptop down.
[87:47.72]Don't you understand the joke?
[87:55.12]They're not going to get it.
[87:56.36]They're not going to get it.
[87:56.94]It's too hard.
[87:58.76]It's too hard.
[88:01.54]It's too hard.
[88:01.96]You're not going to get it.
[88:03.20]You guys, you're not going to get it.
[88:08.56]Oh, fuck.
[88:10.40]That was pretty close.
[88:18.13]If this goes in, that's my whole livelihood.
[88:24.08]So anyways, you are not capable.
[88:28.64]This is the easiest game of the day.
[88:30.92]I want to be very clear on that.
[88:32.92]This is the easiest game of the whole day.
[88:35.40]You did the frog launcher.
[88:37.18]You can't do something as simple as hit the target.
[88:44.08]Hey, do I have nerd neck wicked bad?
[88:47.02]Just say yes or no.
[88:48.76]Do I?

[88:52.68]Should I stand up straight?
[88:55.56]Okay, on a scale of 1 to 10, how bad is my nerd neck?
[88:57.99]Like 10?
[89:05.61]I may as well just drop it.
[89:10.25]They're not going to do it.
[89:12.09]No.
[89:12.15]Way too high.
[89:13.09]Way too high.
[89:13.65]You've got to go lower.
[89:17.70]It's not going to fucking happen.
[89:19.64]I am as safe as you could possibly be.
[89:22.54]It's never going to happen.
[89:24.38]You'll never dunk me, you fuckers.
[89:27.95]Fuck all of you.
[89:29.05]It's not going to happen.
[89:35.72]Oh, no!
[89:36.68]Oh, no, no!
[89:37.68]I can't believe it.
[89:38.66]Not my Dell Inspiron 4100!
[89:40.20]This is burning my eyes.
[89:44.12]This is burning my eyes.
[89:46.33]Oh, shit!
[89:48.13]Not my Dell Inspiron!
[89:51.45]Yeah, actually, congrats.
[89:52.95]Fuck you guys.
[89:54.15]Congratulations.
[89:54.95]I said fuck you, that's why.
[89:56.80]I said fuck you, that's what happened.
[90:09.04]I really didn't.
[90:09.91]I really didn't think that would happen.
[90:12.35]Alright, I'll be back on here.
[90:14.15]We good?
[90:28.02]I'm so embarrassed.
[90:28.84]I can't believe, it didn't take that long.
[90:32.32]Didn't take that long.
[90:34.48]Nice job.
[90:35.52]I'll accept it.
[90:37.86]What I really can't believe is the fact that I have an injury.
[90:41.56]I'm hiding it from you guys.
[90:43.54]Stupid fucking umbrella.
[90:47.84]I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
[90:49.82]I was looking at tiny umbrellas like, oh, what if it was rain?
[90:51.90]I literally pinched my fucking finger and it's like hurts.
[90:54.78]I hurt myself.
[90:57.25]of all the fucking things.
[90:59.36]How disappointing.
[91:00.98]You could have taken like my skull cap off of the ball.
[91:02.92]No, I pinched my hand on a Pauly fucking, whatever it is.
[91:09.02]Good work.
[91:09.40]But can you, how fucked up is my hair?
[91:12.02]I don't know.
[91:12.77]I probably look so bad.
[91:14.29]This is like real Jeremy, you know what I'm saying?
[91:16.73]Jeremy Albert sits in front of you right now.
[91:18.53]I can't pretend, I can't fucking, what are they saying?
[91:20.59]I can see the chat, but I can't, it's too far away.
[91:23.53]Just yell out a fucking word, whatever they're saying.
[91:27.94]He said balding.
[91:28.98]You guys have got my eye on you who have said that.
[91:34.18]Any focus coming out of my nose, just nod yes or no.
[91:36.99]Yeah?
[91:37.19]Are there?
[91:37.51]That's great.
[91:40.13]I thought it was going to take longer than that.
[91:43.98]They're making it harder.
[91:45.54]He's like...
[91:58.19]Just for the next few minutes, I'm just gonna take a nap.
[92:00.12]It's been a long fucking couple days.
[92:05.26]Somebody grab... There's a blanket that's down there, and I can't reach it.
[92:10.56]He can't reach it!
[92:11.30]I actually can't reach this blanket that's over there.
[92:13.40]I'm supposed to... I'm gonna go to bed.
[92:14.86]And, like, good luck.
[92:18.78]People that come to this stream that don't know what's going on, I can imagine if you see a guy sleeping on stream in a clown-like parade thing with a dunk tank underneath him, you're probably going to be like, this guy sucks.
[92:34.37]No, you won't.
[92:35.35]No, you won't.
[92:35.99]You're going to be like, this guy's awesome, and this stream has been awesome, and it's been a fucking awesome day so far, and we got way more to do.
[92:45.35]Somebody get that blanket under these feet.
[92:49.65]Let's go.
[92:51.15]Get out of my face.
[92:51.93]You're fucking blocking the view.
[92:56.03]This thing fucking is so heavy.
[93:11.66]What a bad idea.
[93:12.56]Alright, I'm ready to go to bed.
[93:13.70]Let's go.
[93:34.05]Don't do it again right off the bat.
[93:35.89]Not immediately.
[93:38.98]Can I get some ResidentSleepers in the chat, please?
[94:08.09]You guys are just so, you guys are so bad at this.
[94:10.84]I can fucking sleep.
[94:41.12]I can feel it every time it sucks This joke is like it's funny, but like I actually have to close my eyes, and I don't like that I don't like closing my eyes for this Does my hair look like a fucking rabbit animal it probably does Hey remember how funny it was remember how funny it was when you aimed at the cage You should do that like five or six more times
[95:16.72]Hey, remember how funny that was?
[95:48.45]Hey, that was really funny.
[95:50.93]That was incredibly funny.
[96:01.34]Why is it a package in a package?
[96:07.15]Get out of here.
[96:07.87]Go over there.
[96:26.75]I need a lighter.
[96:33.12]Is my phone in my pocket?
[96:36.66]I hope my phone's not in my pocket.
[96:39.20]That would not be very good at all.
[96:44.00]Hey, how are you over there, sir?
[96:48.41]You got it once, I don't think you'll get it again.
[96:54.71]That's part of the act!
[97:01.49]Hey, why don't I go back to bed?
[97:03.41]Why would I smoke in bed?
[97:14.66]I gotta... I have to, like, swear at you more, because that's the only way you're gonna do it.
[97:20.22]What's wrong with me, a bug?
[97:21.16]No.
[97:21.36]Alright, you guys.
[97:29.20]Got it once.
[97:30.62]I don't know if you'll get it again.
[97:32.40]That was a fluke.
[97:33.66]It was just a fluke.
[97:34.28]That's all it was.
[97:34.77]You broke my fucking computer too.
[97:37.17]You know where I got that?
[97:38.01]This thing.
[97:46.20]This thing weighs like fucking 100 pounds right now.
[97:49.23]Do you like this?
[97:50.59]You do?
[97:50.87]Do you want to see it go underwater?
[97:52.35]Well, then play better.
[97:53.69]It's not that hard.
[97:54.43]Play better.
[97:55.07]And you'll see this go underwater.
[97:56.61]How long do I have to do the ResidentSleeper I'm sleeping on stream joke?
[97:59.92]Do better, play better.
[98:02.04]That's the power of doing.
[98:04.04]Home, whatever the company is.
[98:08.63]Oh, God.
[98:18.54]I don't need the cigar.
[98:19.64]Get the fucking cigar away from me.
[98:23.53]You're not going to do it.
[98:28.31]It's not going to happen.
[98:35.97]You guys can't do it twice.
[98:38.46]Did I think you'd be able to do it two times?
[98:40.40]Absolutely not.
[98:41.28]You only did it once accidentally.
[98:44.34]Accidentally the first time.
[98:46.61]No fucking way you'll do it twice.
[98:51.71]How many people are... Hey, hey, how many people are watching right now?
[98:54.39]How many people are there?
[98:56.47]We have a count on how many people are watching?
[98:59.15]Like 200 of you can't do this?
[99:01.25]200?
[99:01.27]I can't see the chat from here.
[99:02.03]There's at least 125 people here.
[99:03.49]You guys can't figure this out?
[99:05.87]You did it already?
[99:07.63]What do you want?
[99:15.24]You guys are like, there's enough people here to do this.
[99:17.90]And I'm shocked that you haven't been able to do it.
[99:20.08]It's just, it's kind of embarrassing at this point.
[99:23.03]I had like this joke where I was going to fall in the dunk tank with my fucking fellow blanket.
[99:27.31]And you're not even capable of doing that.
[99:29.81]Really?
[99:31.82]Come on.
[99:33.16]Don't show my feet.
[99:33.94]Don't show feet.
[99:34.52]That's like, that's not good.
[99:36.52]I don't want my feet on camera.
[99:38.14]Like that's a big, that's a thing.
[99:40.54]Trust me when I say that.
[99:41.42]Like, don't show my feet on camera.
[99:42.67]Like, people will fucking scream about it.
[99:44.39]Anyways.
[99:45.65]I mean, seriously.
[99:47.83]We're looking for skill here.
[99:49.73]How bad?
[99:51.05]I know you.
[99:51.77]I know you very well.
[99:52.83]How bad's the hair?
[99:54.37]Give me, like, a scale of 1 to 10.
[99:58.69]Hey, whoa.
[99:59.37]I'm going to bed on stream again.
[100:06.37]Come on.
[100:07.27]Come on.
[100:07.89]Do it.
[100:10.03]I'll catch it in the air.
[100:30.49]You got lucky that first time.
[100:32.41]I don't think it's going to happen again.
[100:34.19]There's a smell emanating from this tank.
[100:37.43]It's it's very much like it's it's a it's an ammonia smell I Didn't piss in it.
[100:44.95]I promise I'm gonna keep doing this routine until it works Okay, you're not gonna get it it's not gonna happen I really don't think so Close it's not gonna work
[101:10.84]Oh wow.
[101:13.54]You can't hit a target that's sitting in the middle of the canvas.
[101:17.75]It's right there.
[101:19.55]It's so easy.
[101:21.19]It's right there.
[101:22.55]It doesn't move.
[101:23.95]It doesn't go anywhere.
[101:25.13]It's right fucking here.
[101:27.17]It's a circle.
[101:29.17]You can't even hit a circle.
[101:30.77]That's unbelievable.
[101:35.97]I will hold this against you for the next 10 fucking years.
[101:40.63]You understand?
[101:41.77]I almost fell off.
[101:42.89]I'm slipping.
[101:49.46]I'm out.
[101:49.70]I'm gonna fall off.
[101:51.98]You're not gonna get it.
[101:53.12]You guys know.
[102:04.49]It wasn't enough power.
[102:19.33]You gotta get it in the circle.
[102:24.43]That was me falling, not you winning, by the way.
[102:27.67]Because I'm wet and I'm sliding off the seat.
[102:33.22]I'm just doing weightlifting.
[102:40.03]Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.
[102:45.04]You guys, you guys suck.
[102:47.54]I'll be real honest.
[102:53.40]Oh, wait, wait, wait, no.
[102:55.95]This thing is...
[103:03.86]It's that way, blind streamer.
[103:06.08]It's that way.
[103:06.84]Are you blind?
[103:08.52]Are you guys blind?
[103:09.28]Are you blind?
[103:11.78]You're looking for that.
[103:16.40]Can you see that?
[103:17.16]Can they see the circle?
[103:19.08]I just want to confirm they can see the circle.
[103:21.91]Okay, they can?
[103:28.09]Oh, right here.
[103:28.69]Come on.
[103:30.05]Come on.
[103:31.78]Oh, this is technically a circle, but not the right one.
[103:35.86]Some of you wanted so badly to be in the face.
[103:37.54]It's not going to happen.
[103:38.18]Good luck.
[103:38.96]That was probably really loud for production.
[103:50.72]There are fucking bugs in here.
[103:58.74]Oh, by the way, I was... I was real tired.
[104:05.41]Hey, you want a moth?
[104:07.81]I just swallowed one of those.
[104:09.79]And I'm not gonna freak out about it because it seriously went down my throat and my esophagus and my stomach.
[104:13.83]I would panic right now if I was psychic, but this is not on stream.
[104:16.83]I'd literally fucking start panicking, but I swallowed a fucking moth that was this big.
[104:19.77]You got two.
[104:23.21]Congratulations, I get to do five.
[104:26.89]Fucking animals.
[104:40.26]One more time?
[104:42.70]Okay, this thing is too heavy.
[104:50.30]Actually, it's pretty great that you can do it at all.
[104:57.76]I got jeans on, don't fucking panic.
[104:59.15]Is the GoPro in the right spot?
[105:15.22]Only operate these things if you're a professional, which I am.
[105:28.29]Fucking laptop.
[105:34.08]What happened?
[105:34.44]What happened?
[105:35.68]Jackpot.
[105:39.99]What do you mean chat got me?
[105:40.93]What do you mean chat got me?
[105:41.98]Chat got you.
[105:43.04]How did chat get me?
[105:44.16]How does it work?
[105:44.52]I don't understand.
[105:45.04]I don't know.
[105:49.76]Alright, so... Are we doing another one?
[105:54.86]Let's go.
[105:55.28]Line it up.
[105:55.98]Let's go.
[105:56.84]Come on.
[105:57.44]Give me everything you got.
[106:00.02]Give me the... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[106:01.29]We're not pulling me again.
[106:02.63]No, no, no, no, no.
[106:03.27]We're gonna shoot the robot.
[106:04.99]Chat has to shoot the robot at the circle.
[106:06.91]Don't pull him again.
[106:07.87]I heard that over production.
[106:10.10]I heard that overproduction, they said it, they said pull him again.
[106:12.50]I don't want to do that.
[106:14.80]We're going to do it, we're going to fire the bot.
[106:19.57]I just hear over here, pull him again.
[106:22.35]I'm just like, no, don't pull him again.
[106:30.10]So, um, there's much more today.
[106:32.72]This is, this is not it.
[106:35.45]I'm happy that you could at least get me once.
[106:37.11]The second time was bullshit.
[106:38.25]They fucking... Let's go.
[106:42.69]Try it again.
[106:44.43]I want you to give me everything you have.
[106:47.53]Everything you have.
[106:50.56]First try.
[106:52.38]Get it first try.
[106:53.90]Get it first try or I'm done.
[106:56.72]First try or I'm done.
[107:00.56]First try or I'm done.
[107:02.30]I'll say it five times.
[107:18.34]This is so wet.
[107:20.20]It's so wet.
[107:20.64]It's uncomfortable.
[107:22.86]I'm just going to scream.
[107:30.95]You guys don't got what it takes.
[107:33.07]And that's fine.
[107:34.69]You did get it.
[107:35.17]You beat this more than any other game, though.
[107:37.45]That's the thing.
[107:38.03]That's good on you.
[107:38.65]I'm going to scream the whole time.
[107:43.09]Just be ready.
[107:43.76]This mic is going to be loud.
[107:48.65]I was spellin'.
[107:53.56]No, that didn't work.
[107:54.78]I thought it happened.
[107:55.88]You know when you have, like, a flash of something that's going on, and you, like, you kind of process it in your brain a little bit?
[108:09.20]You know what I'm talking about.
[108:10.18]When you have a flash in your mind and you know what's happening, what's happening right this second, that's like, what the fuck is happening right now?
[108:18.18]Is this a dream?
[108:18.86]Is it... Is this actually, actually happening?
[108:25.18]I guess it is.
[108:26.76]This was a dream that I had.
[108:28.60]And then I decided to turn it into a livestream.
[108:31.13]So technically it is a dream.
[108:33.37]You're coming up here and I'm just, I'm wondering why.
[108:35.01]So you have something to ask?
[108:36.73]You?
[108:37.17]You have something to ask me?
[108:38.61]What is it?
[108:40.75]You know, you're just coming up here.
[108:42.25]You're just like getting in my way for some reason.
[108:45.58]Well, I can tell you a quick little story while we try to have a little bit of a production issue.
[108:52.18]One time, I don't have anything for you.
[108:54.74]I literally, there's like, don't show, I'm telling you, don't do that.
[108:59.07]I told you that like five times.
[109:00.89]You should have listened to me the first time.
[109:03.31]Get this guy out of here.
[109:06.51]You understand?
[109:06.97]Like, twitch.tv has this thing where they fucking just scream the word.
[109:11.25]It's an F word.
[109:12.79]It's not F-U-C.
[109:14.85]No.
[109:18.02]Get the fuck out.
[109:19.32]I'm dead.
[109:19.88]That was intentional.
[109:28.32]That was intentional.
[109:33.17]This is so disorienting.
[109:41.05]You fucking guys.
[109:43.36]No, I ain't showing that.
[109:45.44]I'll get like arrested.
[109:46.46]So what do you think so far?
[109:50.52]You having fun?
[109:51.88]We still got four more games to play and more.
[109:54.95]By the way, I just want to make it very clear how fucking incredible was Cuddles and Polite Polly.
[110:02.78]That was unbelievable.
[110:05.96]That's like the best show I think I've seen all year.
[110:08.10]I saw Far From Home, and that was a better movie than Far From Home.
[110:11.59]I mean, Far From Home was a great movie, though, so I don't know.
[110:29.39]Like, I really think that this, like, look, just look at the water.
[110:32.09]Like, look at this.
[110:32.63]This is disgusting.
[110:34.39]I have to, like, breathe this in.
[110:35.87]Do you understand that this is how, this is, like, green at this point.
[110:38.59]I have to get the fuck out of this.
[110:40.37]I'm gonna go, like, take a shower, and I'm gonna go dry off.
[110:43.59]We're gonna move on.
[110:44.75]And what is next?
[110:46.44]We are going to something very important.
[110:54.42]It's fucking disgusting.
[110:55.36]So when you go to a carnival, there's some things you do at a carnival.
[110:58.36]What do you do at a carnival?
[110:59.66]Let's see it in chat.
[111:01.91]What do you do?
[111:02.41]Look, I can see his dick.
[111:03.27]That's not what you do at a carnival.
[111:04.35]I mean, like, funny, but you play games, you see clowns, and you ride rides.
[111:10.71]You don't think that everyone would have rides ready for you?
[111:15.00]You can nod your head no.
[111:16.28]Enjoy getting onto one of those rides at the carnival.
[111:20.44]Have fun.
[111:21.06]I'll see you in a few moments.
[111:25.41]Go ride the ride.
[111:26.41]And don't show my fucking feet on camera.
[111:56.68]Thank you.
[113:35.36]Thank you.
[115:00.80]Thank you.
[117:17.17]yeah yeah
[119:32.16]music music
[122:03.46]so
[123:28.96]Did somebody puke on the ride?
[123:31.60]Somebody puked on the .
[123:33.66]Come on.
[123:34.20]You puked on a Ferris wheel ride.
[123:39.26]That was supposed to a few minutes.
[123:41.70]Somebody threw up on the ride.
[123:44.55]You puked on a Ferris wheel.
[123:56.88]Do you have the stomach of a fucking two-year-old?
[124:03.12]And I'm fucking huge, by the way!
[124:07.36]Look at how big I am!
[124:13.02]I just kicked the mic so bad.
[124:17.30]How do you puke on a Ferris wheel?
[124:22.39]I'm the biggest motherfucker you've ever seen in your life!
[124:26.45]Check it out.
[124:33.15]See you later.
[124:35.37]Have fun.
[124:35.79]Have fun in the filler segment.
[124:39.11]Take a look outside your screen.
[124:40.35]I know you've seen Las Vegas, beautiful Las Vegas.
[124:42.97]But there's something else.
[124:44.26]There's other stuff here.
[124:46.90]That was cool, too.
[124:47.66]I don't know what that was.
[124:48.86]Was that a sandcastle?
[124:52.28]That was a pretty nice sandcastle.
[124:55.80]Well, I'll give you a reality of what happened here.
[124:58.41]I'm going to break it down for you real easy.
[125:01.09]You broke it.
[125:03.57]You broke it.
[125:04.51]It's okay.
[125:05.41]Too many people were typing at the same time, and you ripped the belt off of the pitching machine.
[125:13.28]So good work.
[125:14.44]I could count on you to do that.
[125:17.32]So don't worry.
[125:17.74]Okay.
[125:18.54]It's going to get fixed.
[125:19.24]We're working on it right now.
[125:21.18]There are many more things that are going to happen here.
[125:25.51]But you have put too many inputs in, and you've crushed the robot that was going to be the pitching machine robot.
[125:31.65]Thank God we did the tongue deck first, by the way, because that would have been bad if we didn't.
[125:36.55]But yeah, we are almost at the point of the show where we're going to do something else very special.
[125:43.78]What do you think?
[125:44.70]We're going to do something for you.
[125:46.84]When you go to a carnival...
[125:48.39]You tend to, like we said, check out the rides.
[125:51.11]Shut this fucking thing off.
[125:52.69]I can hear it.
[125:53.81]And it's irritating me.
[125:55.87]When you go to a carnival, you typically ride rides like you just did.
[126:00.73]You go to the midway games.
[126:03.59]You lose over and over again.
[126:05.15]But you also get...
[126:07.34]This thing taken care of, if you know what I mean.
[126:09.90]So what we're going to do is we're going to paint a picture of you.
[126:13.56]That's right, you.
[126:15.08]You.
[126:15.50]I'm talking about you in the chat right now.
[126:17.82]You're going to get a painting of yourself.
[126:19.86]Do what you want with it, but it's going to take a while because obviously the artist has to actually draw you.
[126:25.23]So they're going to do that.
[126:26.89]They'll take care of that.
[126:29.84]I want you to sit down.
[126:32.48]Have a seat over there.
[126:34.38]And I know I said that a little weirdly.
[126:35.86]I said that like as if you're in trouble.
[126:37.96]You're not in trouble.
[126:39.04]You're not.
[126:39.52]I promise you are not in trouble.
[126:41.49]We are going to go again to the amusings of, again, cuddles and polypolite.
[126:53.54]And they are going to draw a picture of you.
[127:04.57]Hey, Pollyanna, you're supposed to wake up.
[127:06.63]You've got work to do, you know that?
[127:08.16]Oh.
[127:08.96]Yes, you do.
[127:09.58]Oh, my.
[127:10.46]Yes, you have to.
[127:11.14]Oh, my.
[127:11.96]I forgot.
[127:13.14]Yeah, well, you better not forget anymore because you've got to pick out somebody and you've got to draw a picture of them.
[127:18.27]They're one of the people in the home in the audience that are watching the show.
[127:21.47]Oh.
[127:21.63]Yeah, and you've got to do it.
[127:23.37]what I know what I can do well you just wait a minute because I'm going to give you your tickle feather because that's going to make it easier for you yes I am I'm going to help you tickle feather because then you'll be a real artist and yeah that would be good and then you'll do a good job okay okay let me see oh you're looking fine oh pretty dolly yeah you're looking good

[127:53.39]Cause they're waiting.
[127:54.55]They're waiting.
[127:55.35]Alright.
[127:55.69]Thank you so much, cuddles.
[127:58.43]Bye bye.

[128:07.80]I need to find somebody.
[128:10.94]That's me.
[128:12.68]She said I look nice.
[128:17.05]Oh, I do look nice.
[128:20.35]Oh, I look so nice.
[128:23.07]I'm looking like a real artist.
[128:25.21]Yes, I do.
[128:30.87]Have to kiss myself.
[128:31.79]Alright.

[128:45.18]They're too fuzzy.
[128:47.22]Oh, I can find somebody.
[128:57.22]I can look, I can look deep into the homes of my viewers.
[129:03.95]Oh, I gotta find someone.
[129:19.01]Oh!
[129:21.21]Whoa!
[129:22.99]I found someone.

[130:26.98]I'll wait a little time.
[130:31.98]Hey, hey, Polly.
[130:32.66]Polly, wait, wait, wait.
[130:33.62]You're doing such a good job, and you're working so hard.
[130:36.24]I thought I would give you a present.
[130:38.51]I brought you something.
[130:39.89]That's for me.
[130:40.59]Maybe you're a little tired, yeah, because you haven't had a whole lot to eat today.
[130:44.17]So I thought I'd give you a little something for you.
[130:46.37]Is that OK?
[130:47.25]Oh, is that for me?
[130:49.43]That's for me.
[130:50.31]Oh, I don't think so.
[130:51.78]Very much.
[130:53.12]Check it out.
[130:53.68]I know you're going to like it.
[130:55.04]I'm so hungry, too.
[130:56.40]You're going to like it.
[130:58.00]Oh, boy.
[130:58.92]Oh, my god.
[131:00.36]We have quarterback.
[131:03.71]Oh, thank you so much.
[131:08.17]Thank you so much.
[131:10.59]I'm so hungry.
[131:11.63]I know.
[131:12.37]I'm very hungry.
[131:14.05]I'm very, very hungry.
[131:16.34]There it is.
[131:17.06]Open it up.
[131:18.96]Yeah, that's a quarter pounder.
[131:20.28]That's what it is.
[131:21.42]Yeah, see?
[131:22.78]That's a quarter pounder.
[131:24.04]That's a quarter pounder.
[131:26.70]It's a quarter pounder.
[131:28.11]Yeah, see?
[131:29.03]You pound a quarter.
[131:30.99]I got it.
[131:31.47]I got it.
[131:31.95]See?
[131:34.12]Oh, well, cuddles, I can't eat that.
[131:36.40]I thought I could have you some food.
[131:38.43]Is that nice?
[132:02.22]Beautifully beautified.
[132:03.02]Well, we'll see what they come up with at the end of the show.
[132:06.56]Maybe they're painting you.
[132:08.30]Well, they are painting you.
[132:09.64]Of course they are.
[132:10.64]So what we have here is we have a series of images on the backdrop here.
[132:17.23]You've played Down the Clown before.
[132:20.23]You're about to play it on stream, motherfucker.
[132:22.33]That was rude.
[132:23.61]That was really rude.
[132:24.17]But you just dunked me in the tank and I just have to change.
[132:26.21]I had to change my clothes for God's sakes.
[132:29.41]That was rude.
[132:29.87]Was that too rude?
[132:30.77]Should I have been a little bit nicer?
[132:32.54]Was that too rude?
[132:33.86]Was that fine?
[132:34.82]Was that too rude?
[132:35.36]OK.
[132:36.10]I feel like that was a little rude.
[132:37.36]So you need to aim this machine.
[132:40.28]It's the same machine that was at the dunk tank, by the way.
[132:43.26]You need to aim this machine at the various images on the screen.
[132:48.12]And there are quite a few, as you see.
[132:50.32]Knock them down, down the clown.
[132:53.46]You're in control.
[132:55.06]The controls will be on the screen.
[132:56.82]They're pretty similar to what they were in the Dung Tank, so obviously right.
[133:01.20]We've got Jerma Joop 1, Jerma Joop 2.
[133:03.90]Can we see some in the chat, please, by the way?
[133:06.03]We are.
[133:06.83]We can see them.
[133:08.79]I have to get out of the way, because I've been told that this will hit me from any point inside of the cube.
[133:14.59]So I kind of have to get the hell out of here, because you guys will seriously injure me.
[133:19.18]And the only injury I've had all day was from the little umbrella.
[133:24.02]This is true, by the way, all the production people.
[133:26.01]I actually got injured by the little umbrella.
[133:29.31]Like, seriously.
[133:30.69]And we had to wrap it up, and there was blood everywhere back there.
[133:35.75]Do your worst.
[133:36.71]Knock them all down.
[133:37.83]Try to get as many as you can.
[133:39.75]Good luck.
[133:41.11]I will be commenting, and I can see the chat this time.
[133:43.51]I don't trip over this.
[133:46.68]Good luck.
[133:48.14]Make it work.
[133:51.04]Your inputs are disabled at the moment, but they will be active very soon.
[134:00.03]Any food in this carnival?
[134:01.05]Yes, there is.
[134:02.03]There is plenty of food.
[134:14.64]What happened to audio?
[134:15.56]I'm still here, I'm fine.
[134:17.53]I just have to get away from the machine.
[134:25.29]Wow, that was close.
[134:26.31]That was close.
[134:30.43]Right off the bat, almost right there.
[134:32.83]Nice feet, man.
[134:34.02]Give me a break.
[134:38.21]We got a guy here that wasn't aware of the feet thing.
[134:42.39]Take down the Jupiter first.
[134:44.67]There's no feet on camera.
[134:46.51]There's no feet on camera.
[134:48.03]Stop talking about feet.
[134:49.23]There's no feet on camera.
[134:55.73]Jupiter first.
[134:57.27]Take it down.
[135:10.25]Oh, you got it!
[135:12.49]JermaJoop 4 has been knocked down.
[135:14.76]Congratulations, good job.
[135:16.06]I did it.
[135:16.62]No, you collectively did it.
[135:18.08]Together you did.
[135:22.32]Can you get them all?
[135:23.82]Can you get all four?
[135:26.70]No, that was me.
[135:27.64]It was me.
[135:30.00]It was all of you.
[135:30.91]You all did it.
[135:32.45]Can't you just give yourself some credit, all of you, together?
[135:34.43]Ah, let's go!
[135:42.67]Go for Jermajupiter 1!
[135:43.73]Jermajup 1!
[135:44.35]Jermajup 1!
[135:44.91]Jermajup 1!
[135:45.47]Let's go!
[135:50.45]By the way, these robots are all provided by Animark.
[135:54.43]They- What- Oh, that was a fucking terrible display.
[135:56.93]Absolutely disgusting.
[135:58.98]Were you guys even trying?
[135:59.96]Wait, what the hell was that?
[136:03.72]See, I- Right now, I get to be right over here.
[136:06.16]I can see the cameras.
[136:07.66]I can see the chat.
[136:08.94]That was disgusting.
[136:12.71]That was so bad.
[136:14.01]Do better than that.
[136:14.73]Like seriously, I'm watching right now.
[136:16.15]This is the first time I've been able to watch.
[136:19.89]I suck, you suck.
[136:20.77]You mean you, what are you talking about?
[136:23.25]You guys saying I suck?
[136:25.98]I have nothing to do with this.
[136:26.94]I'm just, I'm an observer of what you guys are doing.
[136:30.36]I didn't do anything.
[136:32.40]This is, you have to control this.
[136:37.05]Tilt up, tilt down, aim left, aim right, W-A-S-D.
[136:43.13]Get it!
[136:47.12]Oh!
[136:52.62]That was, oh, it went down!
[136:54.88]It went down.
[136:56.02]That technically counts.
[137:01.20]That counts, I guess.
[137:02.28]200 IQ chat.
[137:12.14]Something like that.
[137:15.32]Alright, by the way, if you get all four Jerma Jupiters down, I will dab in front of the camera.
[137:21.81]Oh, what?
[137:23.01]I ain't doing it unless you get all four.
[137:27.47]I will dab on camera if you get all four Jerma Jupe.
[137:30.69]One Jerma Jupe, two Jerma Jupe, three Jerma Jupe, four.
[137:33.91]How's that for incentive?
[137:38.39]Come on, do it.
[137:39.74]You wanna dab?
[137:44.04]No, no, you got it in the same spot, right in the same spot as before.
[137:49.70]Come on.
[137:51.80]Come on.
[137:54.62]More to the left, pull it over.
[137:59.46]A is left, D is right.
[138:06.70]You have to tilt it.
[138:08.46]W is tilt up, S is tilt down.
[138:12.11]Play by the rules, goddammit, before I cancel it.
[138:16.95]Where are you going?
[138:17.53]Where are you going?
[138:22.88]Where are you going with this?
[138:24.34]There you go.
[138:24.98]There you go.
[138:25.32]Come on.
[138:25.58]Do it.
[138:25.72]Do it.
[138:25.96]Do it.
[138:26.34]Do it.
[138:26.54]Do it.
[138:27.62]You got one second.
[138:29.52]Oh, too far.
[138:30.44]Too far.
[138:30.92]Too far.
[138:31.26]Let me get back there.
[138:33.69]Let me coach you guys a little bit here.
[138:36.33]I feel like if I was on camera, and I was back there, aim at the streamer's face.
[138:40.89]You know what I'm saying?
[138:47.50]It's like, let's go.
[138:49.64]Come on.
[138:50.46]Right here.
[138:52.10]The streamer is now ready to get hit in the face by a fucking ball.
[138:56.12]You actually did it already.
[138:58.22]I mean, surprising, yes.
[139:00.44]Hit the streamer in the face.
[139:02.68]Hit the streamer in the face.
[139:03.70]You can do it, I know you can.
[139:05.95]I know you have it in you.
[139:07.59]Once there's real danger involved, real danger, I could get hurt here.
[139:12.41]Do it.
[139:13.23]Right here.
[139:13.67]Dribble droop three.
[139:15.69]That's not in the right spot.
[139:16.71]Turn it.
[139:20.29]Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[139:28.78]Get it.
[139:34.26]You gotta go left.
[139:36.19]Pull it this way.
[139:37.63]Pull it this way.
[139:39.73]I think the ball got stuck.
[139:41.69]Ball was lodged.
[139:43.97]You see, you guys, if you guys are going, and I feel like somebody's spying on me.
[139:47.29]It's you.
[139:48.39]You're the spy.
[139:50.52]It's always you.
[139:51.68]You're coming in, you're showing my feet and shit.
[139:53.76]You know how long it's gonna take to get over, it's gonna take like three years for this community to get over the fact that you showed my feet on camera.
[140:03.60]You show up my feet on camera and all of a sudden, literally... I gotta shuck the balls.
[140:10.73]Because we're running out.
[140:16.53]It's gonna take like two or three years for you guys to get over that.
[140:19.67]You know when you do something that you regret?
[140:22.96]That's one of those things.
[140:24.44]I regret showing my feet on camera.
[140:29.55]Can I ask you a question, seriously?
[140:31.05]I can't see the chat from here, but what the fuck is the feet thing?
[140:33.99]Like, what are you talking about?
[140:34.83]It's just hands.
[140:36.65]They're bigger and they're longer and they're on the bottom of your body.
[140:39.73]Get over it.
[140:43.19]Wait a minute.
[140:44.06]Have you got it?
[140:45.74]Are you going to get it?
[140:50.18]Come on.
[140:51.64]Come on.
[140:54.42]Get it.
[140:54.84]You got to get the full Jupiter or it's not even worth it.
[140:58.29]The whole Jupiter.
[140:59.19]You can do it.
[140:59.83]No, more to the left.
[141:03.64]More.
[141:04.72]Too much.
[141:05.46]Way too much.
[141:06.76]Way... Let me get some balls for you.
[141:12.58]Yeah.
[141:14.10]Guys.
[141:15.72]I know... I mean, not here.
[141:18.38]Here.
[141:19.12]Here.
[141:19.72]Here.
[141:20.12]Can I demonstrate?
[141:20.76]Can I demonstrate for them?
[141:21.74]Yep.
[141:23.38]Guys.
[141:24.56]Like, you...
[141:26.53]You're aiming so far to the other side.
[141:29.81]Oh, sorry.
[141:30.15]I don't want to knock you.
[141:31.21]Is there any, what are the others?
[141:32.19]Any others?
[141:33.23]Let me show you.
[141:34.13]I'll show it to you.
[141:36.87]You guys, you're going so far this way.
[141:39.33]Collectively try to get it in the right spot.
[141:41.58]Look.
[141:42.46]Easy.
[141:45.46]Go ahead.
[141:53.16]Come on, hit the streamer in the face.
[141:54.54]Remember what you did with the fucking frog game?
[141:57.81]Wasn't that funny?
[142:02.69]That's how we shuck balls to get them so we can continue to play the game.
[142:07.47]Down.
[142:08.63]Further down.
[142:10.16]Get Jerma Jupiter or I'll delete the emote.
[142:15.40]You guys have like 10 minutes.
[142:17.78]I will delete this emote if you do not knock it down.
[142:22.26]You don't want that.
[142:22.96]Nobody does.
[142:30.05]Get the timer, get it!
[142:35.26]What the fuck are you going?
[142:37.28]Where are you going?
[142:39.32]What are you?
[142:42.30]I gotta have a talk with chat.
[142:44.52]I'll be back.
[142:45.38]I gotta go see the chat.
[142:46.14]This is like, this is un-fucking-believable.
[142:52.91]I can see what you're saying now.
[142:56.11]Predicted aim.
[142:57.59]I'm gonna delete the emote.
[143:00.55]It's hard, we're trying.
[143:05.41]Look, I'm like rubbing my hands like, of course it's hard.
[143:08.05]It's really hard.
[143:09.77]Please, we need a crosshair.
[143:12.09]We need a crosshair.
[143:13.25]I'm just sitting here rubbing my hands like this is exactly what I wanted.
[143:17.27]Somebody give 10 community subs.
[143:19.29]Holy shit.
[143:20.82]Evil Crucifix, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[143:23.16]Maybe you'll get it.
[143:26.16]Chat needs food.
[143:28.38]I ain't making any more food.
[143:29.44]I almost hurt myself making cotton candy.
[143:31.75]That's not a joke.
[143:33.17]I truly almost hurt my hand.
[143:35.45]That thing spins at like 400 miles per hour.
[143:38.21]I didn't know that and I almost like fucking burnt my hand off.
[143:41.25]Get it!
[143:44.59]That was really close.
[143:45.64]You had a chance.
[143:51.78]Wee hunger.
[143:57.54]Hold.
[143:58.38]Shift it left.
[143:59.12]I know.
[143:59.38]That's what I'm saying.
[144:02.28]Every time you go left and right, it's one step.
[144:07.91]That's not bad.
[144:08.89]That's not bad.
[144:10.17]Bring it down.
[144:10.77]Bring it down.
[144:11.31]Bring it down.
[144:11.89]Too high.
[144:15.45]Too high.
[144:15.99]Too high.
[144:16.39]Too high.
[144:18.00]Come on.
[144:33.65]It's not, what do you mean rigged?
[144:36.11]How is it rigged?
[144:37.91]You guys are in total control.
[144:39.35]I'm not controlling this shit.
[144:40.53]I'm all the way back here.
[144:50.37]You guys, look at where it is.
[144:52.75]It's rigged.
[144:54.41]It's only rigged if you think it is.
[145:02.44]Let us hit you again.
[145:03.50]I didn't let you hit me.
[145:04.44]You actually did.
[145:06.48]If you delete Jupiter, we'll do only feet clips.
[145:09.98]I'm alright with that.
[145:11.11]That's not bad.
[145:11.65]To the right.
[145:12.03]To the right.
[145:12.31]Come on.
[145:12.59]One second.
[145:13.01]To the right.
[145:15.07]Oh, come on.
[145:17.63]You guys got one so quickly.
[145:19.37]And then you've got two so quickly.
[145:22.71]Come on.
[145:24.15]You guys can do it.
[145:30.02]Feed chat?
[145:31.32]Alright.
[145:32.30]Somebody gave 50 community subs.
[145:35.64]Holy shit.
[145:38.18]AB Joe, you just gave 50 community subs.
[145:40.39]You've got to be kidding me.
[145:43.29]Thank you so much, AB Joe.
[145:44.59]I might have missed a lot.
[145:45.67]I've been up in tanks and over in the corner, but seriously, that's a lot of subs.
[145:49.41]Thank you so much.
[145:50.91]Really appreciate it.
[145:53.20]You guys have to at least get some of these going.
[145:54.74]What about Jerma Payne?
[145:58.80]Come on.
[146:00.65]Work together.
[146:02.41]You guys beat Dark Souls, for God's sakes.
[146:06.48]No, not even, almost there.
[146:08.40]Close, but not really close enough.
[146:14.30]What do you get for Jerm of Pain?
[146:17.18]What do you get for Jerm of Pain?
[146:18.82]Well, what will happen is, if you get Jerm of Pain or all four Jupiters, I'll dab on camera.
[146:24.84]You're talking about, because it's easy to get the top four.
[146:27.70]Jerm of Jupe one, Jerm of Jupe two, Jerm of Jupe, I can't even talk.
[146:32.63]If you get jermaPain, I will dab on camera, I swear to God.
[146:35.48]I promise.
[146:37.98]I'm gonna stand behind the net so I don't die.
[146:39.26]Sounds like a good idea.
[146:44.40]See, now I fucked it all up, because everyone's gonna freak out.
[146:46.10]People are gonna be like, well, now we have to do that.
[146:51.85]I thought an incentive would help.
[146:54.15]Oh, now you're going down there, good, good.
[146:56.47]I'm gonna get some balls here.
[146:58.09]Let me help out here.
[147:00.21]I gotta get a few balls.
[147:02.94]I have faith that you guys might be able to, I don't know, depends.
[147:05.64]How bad do you want me to dab on camera?
[147:07.02]This one is stuck there forever.
[147:12.60]If you guys want me to dab on camera, you're gonna have to get jermaPain or all four Jupiters.
[147:17.37]That's the only fucking way that's happening, no chance any other way.
[147:22.31]Let me try to get this one.
[147:28.23]That's wedged, that ain't coming out.
[147:32.00]I hope I don't break this.
[147:32.80]Get out of here.
[147:39.59]I promise I'll do it.
[147:41.09]Right in the middle.
[147:45.33]Remember, you can only do it when it's the green light.
[147:51.03]If you are doing commands with a red light, it's not gonna work.
[147:58.26]Jerm of Pain, there it is.
[147:59.40]That's not even a real emote.
[148:03.33]I put that up there for you guys.
[148:06.25]That's a community place.
[148:09.33]Oh, they're close.
[148:12.37]Oh, you gotta go up a little higher.
[148:15.59]If you go up even 5%, 10%, I will literally dab on gamer do it.
[148:21.17]We suck.
[148:21.93]We suck.
[148:35.29]No, you dunked me twice.
[148:37.38]That's pretty damn good, I will say.
[148:41.72]Get Germapane.
[148:42.70]Get it.
[148:44.34]I know you can.
[148:45.18]A little bit more to the left.
[148:46.88]Maybe to the right.
[148:52.31]Oh, is that it?
[148:54.33]No.
[148:55.61]More.
[148:57.43]You got to go more.
[149:02.91]It's the wind.
[149:09.11]It's getting caught in the wind and flying forward.
[149:12.82]There is a lot of wind.
[149:13.68]You have to remember that.
[149:15.66]More to the left.
[149:20.74]That's too much.
[149:23.36]Don't overcompensate.
[149:24.77]That's not going to help.
[149:27.57]That's not going to help.
[149:32.17]I wonder.
[149:33.17]That looks alright.
[149:34.51]That's not bad.
[149:36.33]That could be it.
[149:39.23]Did they get it?
[149:41.63]Oh!
[149:43.69]That was so close.
[149:45.59]Don't move.
[149:46.65]Nobody touch anything.
[149:48.89]Do not move.
[149:49.73]Just don't move.
[149:50.33]Don't move.
[149:50.61]Don't move.
[149:50.91]Don't move.
[149:51.19]Don't move.
[149:51.69]Don't touch.
[149:52.17]Nobody touch any buttons.
[149:53.95]Just put somebody press W once.
[149:57.79]If someone presses W one time, it will stop that.
[150:02.41]Just W once.
[150:02.77]Don't move.
[150:04.55]Don't move.
[150:05.53]No, stop it.
[150:08.31]No, stop pressing S. W. It's got to go up.
[150:17.60]Up.
[150:18.12]Right, right, right.
[150:18.58]Stop, stop, stop.
[150:19.18]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[150:19.88]Stop, stop, stop.
[150:20.40]Too much, too much, too much, too much.
[150:22.18]That's too high.
[150:23.48]That is too high.
[150:24.62]Down, down, down, down, down.
[150:27.42]Oh, God.
[150:37.82]I love this.
[150:39.14]This is fantastic.
[150:41.12]I was wrong.
[150:41.82]Alright, I'm not going to say anything.
[150:42.80]You guys just do it.
[150:44.28]I'm not going to say anything.
[150:47.54]I'm not going to talk.
[150:49.48]I'm going to watch, OK?
[150:50.67]Don't listen to me.
[150:51.23]I'm wrong every time.
[150:58.49]I'm coming over here.
[151:00.13]I'm coming around.
[151:00.93]Is the wind causing problems?
[151:05.50]We have to have people hold this.
[151:11.71]That's pretty good.
[151:16.57]Oh man.
[151:17.17]Ah, alright.
[151:20.39]Listen, listen to me.
[151:21.25]This is bring it down like once all the people that are fighting going up, up, up, up, up, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[151:29.14]Just, just, just bring it down.
[151:30.76]Once you have to cut the people, there's going to be overcompensation.
[151:34.34]If you're going to go down, somebody press up because some people are spamming it.
[151:38.06]Go keep it there.
[151:39.74]Bring it up, down a little bit.
[151:41.80]That's all you got to do.
[151:45.66]Down a little bit.
[151:47.98]You wanna dab on camera, that's how you're gonna get it.
[151:52.43]That's the only way you're gonna get it.
[151:57.43]You can see that like, which way do we go?
[151:59.87]I think it's up.
[152:03.65]I love it.
[152:04.69]That's so funny.
[152:05.79]Look at this wind.
[152:11.17]The wind just instantly stopped it.
[152:13.84]That's so funny.
[152:15.81]It's never going to happen.
[152:16.77]Good thing I don't have to ever dab.
[152:18.01]That hit the front.
[152:23.19]It's crazy because you got this one in five seconds and then none for 20 straight minutes.
[152:33.95]There's so much in-fighting.
[152:35.15]I love it.
[152:35.81]I love it.
[152:38.52]Get.
[152:39.38]Oh, no.
[152:40.04]You're changing tactics, I think.
[152:42.63]Going up.
[152:44.17]I don't know.
[152:44.97]Going up, it seems.
[152:45.91]Maybe down.
[152:51.13]You can do it.
[152:59.71]Oh!
[153:03.09]Up.
[153:04.97]Alright, hold on.
[153:05.59]Let me get a few.
[153:06.27]Let me get some.
[153:07.67]Let me get some.
[153:08.15]Can I get some balls?
[153:14.23]Look.
[153:16.45]Here.
[153:17.39]I'm the shucker, so.
[153:21.18]You guys have to do this.
[153:22.36]I mean, come on.
[153:23.94]We got all this stuff here.
[153:24.86]You're gonna get shown up.
[153:28.58]Down the clown.
[153:29.98]You guys can't do this?
[153:33.36]This one is stuck here forever.
[153:35.12]Hold on, let me get it out.
[153:40.33]Yeah, let me throw a few.
[153:43.13]Let me see.
[153:43.45]Look, I have to prove it's winnable.
[153:47.39]With the wind, I know it's hard to prove.
[153:48.81]Let me get two.
[153:49.27]Alright, the robot's right here, right?
[153:54.92]It's a twister!
[154:03.64]Alright, I tried.
[154:04.20]Hold on.
[154:09.22]If I can get one of these and just prove it.
[154:14.84]Alright.
[154:16.22]My own game doesn't work.
[154:17.76]It's rigged.
[154:22.07]Surprise.
[154:23.63]Alright.
[154:24.43]I'll give you one.
[154:35.05]OK.
[154:36.21]I got you one.
[154:44.59]It's rigged.
[154:45.29]It comes back up.
[154:51.53]Here we go.
[154:52.57]Here it comes.
[154:54.70]It's actually rigged.
[154:55.88]Well, that's what happens.
[154:58.10]Let's go.
[154:58.52]Accept it.
[154:59.64]Let's do it.
[155:13.67]10 seconds, come on guys, I know you can do it.
[155:16.73]That's too low.
[155:18.51]You gotta pull it up a hair.
[155:20.33]Pull it up a hair.
[155:24.27]The arrow, oh!
[155:27.98]So close!
[155:36.60]Reloading the robot.
[155:39.96]Alright, we're gonna give you guys two more attempts.
[155:44.65]Two attempts.
[155:45.55]I know you can do it.
[155:47.59]Do it.
[155:48.69]I know you can.
[155:50.51]Please.
[155:52.75]You've only got a hair.
[155:55.09]It's very possible.
[155:56.19]I know it's completable.
[155:57.42]I know you've seen me do it from the same distance as the robot.
[156:02.82]Come on.
[156:05.40]You need to win the prize, which is a dab.
[156:08.65]which I'm going to regret for the rest of my life.
[156:10.35]That's not a bad spot.
[156:12.01]Not bad.
[156:12.65]That's pretty bad.
[156:14.65]And that's pretty bad.
[156:17.72]You get one more shot here, guys, and then I'm going to have to show you how it's done.
[156:22.24]You got one more fire.
[156:24.24]And then we're going to have to move on.
[156:30.79]One more shot.
[156:31.69]You got one right off the bat.
[156:41.43]You got one, and 25 minutes later we can't get any others.
[156:45.77]That's surprising.
[156:51.51]Make this be the one, come on!
[156:58.16]Do it!
[157:00.40]Oh!
[157:02.26]Oh my god!
[157:05.79]Unbelievable.
[157:06.87]I can't believe they actually did it.
[157:08.79]That was your last shot.
[157:10.43]That was the final shot.
[157:13.37]Oh, wait.
[157:13.99]That means, hold on.
[157:15.92]That means I have to dab on camera.
[157:20.70]Well, that's not good.
[157:22.36]I fucking can't believe it.
[157:24.98]It deserves some claps.
[157:26.54]It does.
[157:29.28]Two of us will give you some round of applause for that one.
[157:33.81]Alright, time to dab.
[157:34.68]We're going to move on.
[157:35.82]You did it.
[157:36.16]I actually can't believe you didn't.
[157:40.14]I have to dab on camera.
[157:46.97]Which camera am I on?
[157:49.49]Can I just pretend to do it?
[157:51.89]Do I have to actually do a full dab on camera?
[157:55.30]I have to?
[158:06.05]Why did I say that?
[158:06.71]I should have just said you have to get all four.
[158:09.21]My own worst enemy here.
[158:11.20]So which way?
[158:11.82]Which way?
[158:12.14]Left or right?
[158:14.88]That way?
[158:21.94]OK.
[158:22.06]34 years old, by the way, tomorrow.
[158:23.78]Just in case anyone's curious.
[158:25.35]That's not a lie.
[158:25.95]That's real.
[158:27.17]Bang!
[158:27.71]Oh, that hurt.
[158:33.67]You can tell how many times I've done that by me hurting myself on a dab.
[158:41.53]OK, so we're going to move on.
[158:44.61]Thank you.
[158:45.12]I'm afraid this is going to shoot me in the chest.
[158:46.76]Imagine that.
[158:49.08]It was just like.
[158:51.64]We actually had a joke that we were going to do, but we couldn't because it was too dangerous.
[158:56.52]We were going to load in a little dummy ball, a little foam ball, and they were going to shoot me right in the chest with it right at the beginning.
[159:04.56]Like, oh, yeah, I'm introducing the games, and I get hit right in the chest by a fucking ball.
[159:08.41]But there was just the legal shit.
[159:10.33]It was just that we couldn't do it.
[159:11.93]We could not do that because if there was a chance that a regular softball got in there and I would get hit in the chest, it would be like Happy Gilmore.
[159:20.83]That's not alright.
[159:21.81]That's not OK.
[159:23.11]And medical staff speaking, you know, we've got plenty of people that are over there that are ready, waiting in case I get hurt to find an umbrella.
[159:32.78]But medically speaking, we didn't have the staff to be prepared for me to get hit in the face by a real softball.
[159:38.16]So we didn't do it.
[159:40.30]But we are at the point in the show where, and I know there's going to be a lot.
[159:45.33]You know, I can already see it.
[159:46.21]There's already 100 images.
[159:48.03]I can see them on the subreddit.
[159:49.05]And this is the Jerma N85.
[159:51.97]It's still September.
[159:55.27]What day is it?
[159:56.57]Is it 22nd?
[159:57.63]When does September stop?
[160:01.67]So September stops in the end of September.
[160:04.00]If you feel like subbing to the channel, then don't.
[160:06.54]It's not worth it.
[160:07.32]This channel sucks.
[160:10.28]You're better off fucking buying a pack of bubble gum or something, but just don't either.
[160:13.94]Anyways, we have way more to do.
[160:17.02]Let's talk about these.
[160:19.56]So over the course of the stream,
[160:22.86]How did I hurt myself again with this little shit?
[160:26.74]I don't understand.
[160:28.60]I'm hurt.
[160:30.21]I actually hurt myself again.
[160:32.01]How the fuck is this possible?
[160:34.15]The tiny umbrella, the paper.
[160:36.85]I just paper cut my hand.
[160:39.23]I'm alright.
[160:40.03]I'll just wipe it up my ass.
[160:41.65]On my ass, not up.
[160:42.79]You get it.
[160:44.25]We have been tracking how many bits have come in through the course of the stream.
[160:51.76]Over the course of the stream, there has been quite a few bits that have come in.
[160:55.82]So what we're going to do is I'm going to try to collect as many as I possibly can.
[161:00.49]And we're going to do that with a very, very important task that I will have to do.
[161:06.35]And any bits that I do not collect through this machine are going right to charity.
[161:11.65]You heard it here first.
[161:13.31]So, why don't we... You can take this from me.
[161:18.60]Why don't we cut to...
[161:23.53]The Money Machine!
[161:25.07]And welcome, by the way, to the Jerma985 Arcade.
[161:28.15]This is the arcade.
[161:29.35]We have some cool stuff here.
[161:31.05]We've got an authentic Pac-Man stand-up cabinet, which is, you know, that was... You can get it at Walmart.
[161:36.93]It's not that much.
[161:38.37]Money Machine!
[161:39.25]I have to collect as much of this as I can, otherwise it's going right to charity.
[161:42.71]You understand?
[161:44.17]We also have... Ah, forget about that.
[161:45.78]That's not real.
[161:47.34]I am going to get eye protection first.
[161:52.02]Because if one of them's like right there, you know what I'm saying?
[161:55.51]Let's see how much of this I can actually get.
[161:57.39]By the way, thank you to anybody that has given any bits during the stream.
[162:03.17]I am ready to collect as much as I can.
[162:06.23]And what have we got here?
[162:08.68]Somebody gave two, there was, wait, there was a, somebody gave a hundred, there was $200 donation, a bit donation?
[162:16.36]Two 50s.
[162:18.40]A 10?
[162:19.50]Alright, so we got a lot of money here.
[162:21.76]And there was a lot of money that was given so far.
[162:24.67]It's all in here already.
[162:25.83]And just total transparency.
[162:28.49]There it goes.
[162:28.97]It's in there.
[162:30.07]I cannot see it.
[162:31.89]I can't touch it until, of course, this is closed.
[162:35.67]Which, and then I got 60 seconds to figure it out.
[162:43.70]Let's see how much I can get from me, how much money I can collect.
[162:49.65]Are we ready to turn this fucking thing on so I can embarrass myself in front of my parents some more?
[162:54.84]Because I heard they were watching.
[162:56.26]Mom, I'll take you out to dinner tomorrow night.
[162:59.90]Probably like next week.
[163:02.54]I'm ready!
[163:04.58]Begin!
[163:11.47]I got one cent!
[163:16.77]I got a dollar!

[163:28.28]I'm just gonna try and scoot.
[163:32.14]Where's the 100?
[163:32.68]Where's the 100?
[163:36.05]I need that 100.
[163:40.59]I got a 100!
[163:43.87]No, don't put it in your pants, that's bad.
[163:48.82]It's way harder than it looks.
[163:57.32]I can't see.
[164:00.66]They're all wedged in here.
[164:08.10]Is that it?
[164:09.38]That's it?
[164:13.16]So that's it.
[164:15.18]Okay.
[164:16.74]That counts.
[164:17.12]That counts.
[164:17.42]That counts.
[164:17.70]That counts.
[164:17.98]This one counts.
[164:19.83]So what did I get?
[164:20.27]$1.
[164:20.29]Did I lose the $100?
[164:27.03]I have $0.01.
[164:27.31]OK, $1.01.
[164:27.41]Can we keep track of these?
[164:29.67]Alright, that's gone.
[164:31.72]$1.01.

[165:30.54]Holy.
[165:30.86]Alright, let's do it again.
[165:33.50]Did more come in?
[165:34.08]Oh, more money came in.
[165:39.51]More money came in.
[165:41.05]By the way, this doesn't work sit here for show.

[166:10.43]I'm ready.
[166:16.17]Here we go.
[166:16.71]You wanna lock it?
[166:20.86]I'm ready.
[166:22.56]I'm looking for that hundred.
[166:24.52]I'm only going for hundreds.
[166:27.40]What if I just pick them up now?
[166:30.96]Is that legal?
[166:31.44]No?
[166:31.50]Okay.
[166:31.60]Can I?
[166:35.90]Got it.
[166:38.05]$200!
[166:38.07]220,000 bits!
[166:38.29]20,000 of them!
[166:38.61]Let's go!
[167:07.35]I got enough tactics!
[167:37.50]Oh my god!
[167:38.03]Okay, I need help.
[167:48.51]I'm not helping.
[167:49.99]What do you mean help?
[167:51.02]You're not helping me?
[167:54.28]That one counts.
[168:00.28]Hey!
[168:04.27]I need somebody to take these!
[168:06.33]I did it!
[168:08.91]$10.
[168:08.97]$10.01.
[168:08.99]$10.11.
[168:09.01]$12.01.
[168:09.03]Somebody count.
[168:09.69]What is it?
[168:11.93]$12.02.
[168:11.99]Oh my god, $12.03.
[168:39.00]$12.04.
[168:39.04]That can't be it.
[168:51.24]$12.05.
[168:54.66]That tactic was not good, apparently.
[168:57.74]How did I not end up with 100?
[169:01.00]I was like doing the vacuum.
[169:05.80]This is gonna, hold on.
[169:09.47]No, there's nothing else in here.
[169:10.64]That was it.
[169:16.16]OK.
[169:17.52]Well, that's going to charity.
[169:20.62]We are going to move on to the next game.
[169:22.28]I don't need to still wear these.
[169:24.17]We're going on to the next game.
[169:25.03]The next game is going to be the cheese game.
[169:29.69]Get the fucking ball with the cheese.
[169:31.83]See you over there.
[169:33.91]Let's go.
[169:57.65]This is back in the launcher machine.
[170:00.33]We are going to do get the ball in the cheese, Swiss cheese game.
[170:06.08]I feel like you guys can do this one pretty well because if you take a good look, you will see we have
[170:14.76]There's a lot of holes, but we do have one, two, three, four, five, six green holes and some wiffle balls.
[170:23.03]You have to get the wiffle balls into the green holes.
[170:27.77]That's the only way it counts.
[170:29.57]Nothing else counts.
[170:31.65]You have the launcher at your disposal.
[170:34.97]Make it work.
[170:36.11]You'll be launching wiffle balls.
[170:37.24]Let's go ahead and show a how it works.
[170:40.02]As you see, we got to take a look from here.
[170:46.06]I lost.
[170:47.68]Into the green hole is the only way to get points.
[170:50.86]That's it.
[170:52.29]That's the game.
[170:53.75]All these are worth one point, by the way.
[170:56.95]If you get to five points, I'll fucking tap on .
[171:05.64]What do you want?
[171:06.56]What do you guys want from me?
[171:09.95]Five points, then you get to live with it for the rest of your life.
[171:13.17]And you collectively, I don't even know how many people are watching.
[171:15.51]There could be 100, there could be 100,000.
[171:16.85]How many people are watching?
[171:19.32]You get to live with that for the rest of your life and you won a game with a bunch of people.
[171:23.24]So if you could, work together.
[171:26.48]Make it happen and have fun.
[171:29.96]Good luck.
[171:35.71]We're setting up the bot, making it work.
[171:39.37]I actually, I still can't believe that I only got like $11.
[171:42.87]What, did like 300 bucks come in?
[171:45.57]That kinda sucks.
[171:48.66]I gotta say, this room is very expensive.
[171:50.88]I'm gonna have to flip it.
[171:52.56]I'm gonna have to try, I'm gonna have to take out a loan.
[171:57.00]Alright, let's go.
[171:59.28]Wiffle balls, they travel differently than the frogs, the same machine, different game.
[172:03.64]Keep that in mind, the controls are on the screen.
[172:07.90]You're looking for the green holes.
[172:11.68]Not the yellow ones, the green ones.
[172:13.36]Get them in the green ones only, please.
[172:17.82]Otherwise I'll be very upset with you.
[172:20.40]And I'll start fucking talking shit.
[172:22.64]You don't want to hear that.
[172:23.30]In fact, you probably don't want to hear me.
[172:26.48]Maybe a bit rougher if I stop talking at all.
[172:29.80]Oh my goodness, guys.
[172:31.32]Holy shit.
[172:33.08]Not even on the board.
[172:36.44]That's not good.
[172:39.10]Get your whole family here.
[172:40.02]Maybe they'll help you.
[172:41.98]Call your siblings, your grandfather, your grandmother.
[172:46.16]That was pathetic.
[172:47.92]I'm just going to call it like I see it.
[172:50.20]You fell off an edge in Dark Souls.
[172:51.52]That's what you did.
[172:52.28]That's kind of how I can tell you how that was.
[172:55.91]Green holes.
[172:56.91]I know you can do it.
[172:59.01]Sun is shining.
[173:00.33]You're here.
[173:03.63]You got a little bit more control, I think.
[173:05.37]That's not bad.
[173:08.18]Not bad.
[173:13.04]More.
[173:14.82]You've got to get it in the game board at least.
[173:19.01]You've got to get the right spot.
[173:23.49]Here it comes.
[173:24.11]0.
[173:25.89]All the way in the corner.
[173:29.61]That is not any points.
[173:33.28]You're kind of close, but not really.
[173:36.58]Kind of close, but not really.
[173:43.72]You have a few, you have quite a few chances here.
[173:47.83]Going for green.
[173:50.73]Green only.
[173:52.71]Here.
[173:53.61]Here.
[173:54.45]Here.
[173:55.21]Here.
[173:55.61]There, there, they're random.
[173:58.77]So it's not, they're all in one spot.
[174:02.27]15 seconds, come on.
[174:06.40]Cue it up.
[174:10.08]Do it.
[174:11.80]Win it.
[174:17.09]Fuck off.
[174:18.11]Come on.
[174:26.53]I'm walking around doing a presentation and everybody wants to fire at the presenter.
[174:33.19]Hey, that guy walking around, why don't we take fire at that guy's face?
[174:37.63]Like we did last time.
[174:40.57]You got 20 seconds to do this.
[174:42.96]Line it up.
[174:52.54]Two in the corner, don't aim in the corner.
[175:02.70]Oh, close.
[175:05.62]They're not close enough.
[175:08.42]Now the balls stay, so that helps.
[175:11.22]But you do gotta get three points.
[175:14.42]Otherwise you lose.
[175:17.55]You'll lose if you don't get three points.
[175:23.56]I'll leave it.
[175:33.66]I'm not going to fucking run.
[175:34.56]I'll leave it.
[175:40.51]I would try to go short, not go long.
[175:42.95]Cause then it'll roll.
[175:43.63]Oh,
[175:52.54]Almost, not quite.
[175:54.10]So close.
[175:59.10]So close, so far.
[176:01.10]You don't win unless you get it in the green.
[176:03.68]I'm sorry to say, I hate to crush your dreams here.
[176:07.22]And you gotta get three of these.
[176:11.94]You want a shotgun blast at one of these?
[176:13.98]Maybe, for fun?
[176:17.92]Because remember, once they fill in a little, you have a chance here.
[176:22.00]I would go for the left side, but that's me.
[176:25.62]I'm not you.
[176:40.24]Oh shit.
[176:43.05]It got stuck.
[176:44.77]But you aimed it wrong anyways.
[176:47.65]The wind is like pushing it.
[176:50.05]I'll give you a wind denominator.
[176:51.47]Ready?
[176:51.71]Watch this.
[176:52.05]Ready?
[176:53.63]See?
[176:56.27]Wind's going this way.
[177:01.97]I mean, these balls sure are bouncy.
[177:08.28]Hey, I can't believe how bouncy these balls are.
[177:12.68]Jeez, I can't believe it.
[177:14.84]What the heck is going on here?
[177:17.58]This is bouncy grass.
[177:20.90]I'm a trained magician.
[177:21.64]Let me say pretend to be.
[177:27.50]Right here.
[177:29.08]They'll get it right now.
[177:41.15]Two, one, go.
[177:41.43]Too high.
[177:43.25]Pull it down.
[177:44.13]Let me help you.
[177:53.91]See, normally Akane would not do that for you, but I just filled in a few more slots.
[178:01.57]The hammer is like trying to come down so bad.
[178:06.55]And this is the real deal, by the way.
[178:07.77]Take a look at that, look at that engineering.
[178:09.45]This thing is the actual real deal.
[178:14.53]Not a bad spot.
[178:19.13]You gotta get one point, otherwise what a waste of time.
[178:31.08]Zero.
[178:39.59]You don't get points for getting almost there.
[178:41.83]You only get points for getting there.
[178:48.36]One point is worth a pretend sneeze on camera.
[178:52.08]Just in case you're curious.
[178:54.68]I'll do like a funny, I laugh out loud sneeze on camera.
[178:57.82]That's what that's worth.
[178:59.86]Alright.
[179:00.88]Yeah, that's what that's worth.
[179:08.58]I love watching it just fight.
[179:10.92]I love watching the little, like... Judging... That's not even in a hole.
[179:27.77]You got four.
[179:29.86]in the same corner.
[179:31.91]Judging by how much is in here, I would probably pull it out a little.
[179:35.67]You got to come out just like a full foot this way.
[179:40.71]You guys are going way too far into this corner.
[179:44.15]Pull it back a little.
[179:45.05]Hi.
[180:02.41]Okay, sure, let's see what you do.
[180:11.51]Nice try.
[180:17.58]There.
[180:20.76]I'm just filling holes for you guys.
[180:25.38]These don't hurt like the frogs do, the frog hurt.
[180:31.34]Green means go, red means stop.
[180:34.16]You know the controls by now.
[180:42.06]Right here.
[180:43.97]This way, this way, pull it right there.
[180:46.35]You can do it right here.
[180:51.65]Yes, yes, more.
[180:55.69]That's gonna be the one, that's it right there.
[180:57.25]That's a point I think, that's a point.
[181:10.79]Sorry.
[181:13.05]Sorry, guys.
[181:14.65]I thought you guys were going to do it.
[181:16.39]You tried, though.
[181:17.31]Almost.
[181:18.21]Look at how close.
[181:19.03]Look at this.
[181:21.24]One over.
[181:22.28]One over.
[181:23.38]Two over.
[181:24.48]One over.
[181:42.66]Do it.
[181:44.40]There you go.
[181:46.80]Bingo!
[181:48.48]That's one.
[181:50.04]What did I say?
[181:50.55]Oh, right.
[181:51.15]Sorry.
[181:56.89]Switch to this camera over here.
[181:58.39]Get to this camera here.
[181:59.75]Please, get to this camera.
[182:01.13]This one over here.
[182:03.01]If you can for a second.
[182:04.95]I want it clear.
[182:05.49]Switch this one here.
[182:08.41]Like, yeah, switch this one over here.
[182:10.79]You good?
[182:12.20]Thank you.
[182:19.48]What a stupid fucking shitty prize.
[182:21.00]Whatever, keep going.
[182:27.37]You go to a carnival, and the guy's like, hey, it's $5 for two balls.
[182:32.18]If you get one point, I'll sneeze in front of your girlfriend.
[182:36.40]Okay.
[182:40.34]See you later.
[182:40.98]It was nice to meet you.
[182:46.18]What's your boyfriend's name?
[182:47.98]Greg?
[182:48.32]Hey, Greg, how are you?
[182:49.12]My name's Dave.
[182:51.73]Thanks.
[182:58.00]You got one though, three is worth something else.
[183:04.72]No, I thought it was gonna keep rolling.
[183:07.52]Good, you got one.
[183:10.16]You got one, that's all it takes to get a sneeze from the top 192 variety streamer on Twitch.
[183:24.79]I'll be the top 500 variety sneeze streamers on twitch.tv.
[183:29.75]Very proud of that.
[183:36.02]What did he say?
[183:40.08]Have I dropped down a few spots?
[183:49.77]No.
[183:54.46]Look at that.
[183:58.22]You guys are so close to the connect four.
[184:01.92]Look.
[184:05.94]You need one.
[184:07.28]Look at how good that is.
[184:08.23]It's just not good enough.
[184:12.43]So close.
[184:18.41]Do you think the ball staying there would help?
[184:20.23]Apparently not.
[184:30.19]Good, I like the angle.
[184:32.21]I like the angle being used here.
[184:38.09]What happens if we get three points?
[184:39.19]What do I do?
[184:42.59]Should I like elbow drop the table?
[184:46.23]Come on, shit.
[184:51.74]Should I just like elbow drop right in the middle if you guys win?
[184:55.94]Or break by elbow?
[185:01.60]I want to see what you guys are saying.
[185:03.55]I want to go see the chat.
[185:07.49]How's it going?
[185:09.53]You guys capable of this shit?
[185:10.89]I know you are.
[185:11.37]Come on.
[185:13.09]Give us the goat.
[185:13.75]You don't get the goat unless you get two.
[185:16.49]If you get two, you get the goat.
[185:21.41]We get your feet if there's three balls.
[185:23.17]That's not going to happen.
[185:25.49]I can't.
[185:25.77]I'm so sad that that turned into a thing.
[185:29.05]Say Peter for the next point.
[185:30.96]No.
[185:35.89]No!
[185:36.65]Too low.
[185:37.09]That was such a miss.
[185:44.07]I want to see the goat's feet.
[185:46.91]Why?
[185:48.99]Why do you want to see that?
[185:52.95]That was too low and too high, yeah.
[185:59.15]You guys are crazy.
[186:03.68]Come on, turn it!
[186:06.24]We're not making it easy for you.
[186:17.11]That's not bad.
[186:21.27]No, it's over.
[186:23.01]Way over.
[186:30.09]Way over.
[186:32.73]Not bad.
[186:33.33]You're not gonna do it.
[186:42.01]You're going too low.
[186:56.23]Two is for the goat.
[186:57.63]Yeah, if you get two points, you get a goat.
[187:00.89]And I'll hold it up so you can see it on screen.
[187:03.49]You can screenshot it.
[187:05.04]Because I incented everybody goats.
[187:08.10]That whole corner is now taken up.
[187:10.00]Here, ready?
[187:11.30]Give me your hand here.
[187:13.86]There it is.
[187:21.59]Two, get two.
[187:26.01]You know what, I'll help you out even more.
[187:28.01]How much help do you guys need?
[187:32.32]How much do you need?
[187:46.17]Right there, do it!
[187:48.83]How much coaching do you need?
[187:49.97]No score.
[188:00.08]You're running out of space to put these, but I can see where you're going with them, right?
[188:07.38]We can see where you're going with these.
[188:09.98]Mostly on the right side is where you're going.
[188:13.95]Not a whole lot on the left, take one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
[188:17.45]More than 10 shots on the right, less than six on the left.
[188:21.69]You might wanna go for the left here.
[188:24.53]That would probably help.
[188:25.13]Because remember, it bounces around, so it would bounce into the corner, back over here, but you're going too far.
[188:37.83]Damn.
[188:41.47]At least you got a sneeze.
[188:45.50]At least you got a sneeze.
[188:47.16]Hey, let me help!
[189:03.83]Come on!
[189:11.51]Do it for Wailord!
[189:22.70]Okay.
[189:23.42]Alright.
[189:24.22]Hold on.
[189:26.00]Keep playing, guys.
[189:26.62]I mean, like, for real.
[189:28.12]What the fuck is going on here?
[189:29.90]Here.
[189:30.20]I mean, like, give me a break.
[189:44.15]Guys.
[189:44.95]I mean, if you can't do it, you can't do it.
[190:00.64]I'm gonna, I'm trying to help you, I really am.
[190:06.40]What the hell was that?
[190:09.30]Okay, go on, go on, go, go, go, go, go, let's go.
[190:11.56]You got like six extra spots, come on.
[190:13.00]I know you can, just do it.
[190:14.67]Two points.
[190:22.21]You got like three or four extra spots now.
[190:30.04]Come on.
[190:31.28]Look at how many spots you got there.
[190:38.64]You need two points for a goat.
[190:40.46]Do it.
[190:44.84]Come on.
[190:46.02]At this point, it's impossible to lose.
[190:54.63]Wait a minute.
[191:07.95]Just shoot it in this fucking corner.
[191:15.21]Get it in that corner.
[191:16.89]Just get it in the corner and you can win the game.
[191:19.51]Oh shit.
[191:23.64]Hey, can we get that water jug back over here?
[191:42.80]Just get it in the corner and just please win the game.
[191:48.52]All you have to do is get it in that quadrant.
[192:07.39]That's two points.
[192:20.44]Get three, please.
[192:22.38]Get three.
[192:23.54]Just get three so we can move on.
[192:26.72]Just get three points so we can move on, please.
[192:27.92]Thank you.
[192:29.51]If you aim over here, you're an idiot.
[192:31.71]I just want to make sure we're clear.
[192:34.31]If you aim to the right, you might be an imbecile.
[192:37.03]I just want to make sure that we got to be very clear.
[192:42.94]Go on.
[192:43.74]Let's go.
[192:44.20]Do it.
[192:46.02]Do it.
[192:46.80]Come on.
[192:47.72]Right in the teeth.
[192:48.93]Hit me.
[192:49.23]Break all my front row.
[192:51.01]Break the whole front row of teeth.
[192:53.61]Right there.
[192:54.49]Come on.
[193:09.83]Fucking god damn it.
[193:11.71]Do another one.
[193:12.65]Do another one.
[193:14.69]I can't touch my face.
[193:16.31]I can't touch my face.
[193:18.01]If I touch my face, it's paint on my face for the rest of the day.
[193:21.15]That way.
[193:21.95]That way.
[193:22.31]I'll pick it up and put it over there.
[193:28.10]Go for it.
[193:28.42]In there.
[193:33.36]In there.
[193:35.84]In there.
[193:37.54]There you go.
[193:38.34]There you go.
[193:39.04]There you go.
[193:40.88]You're way off.
[193:42.32]You are so way off.
[193:43.32]It's not even funny.
[193:44.22]More to this way.
[193:45.04]There's like pain over here.
[193:48.56]Good.
[193:49.61]More power.
[193:50.25]No, no, no, no.
[193:50.67]More power.
[193:50.97]More, more, more, more, more, more power.
[193:51.77]More power.
[193:52.21]More power.
[193:52.63]More power.
[193:52.95]That's not enough.
[193:54.67]That's not enough.
[193:56.67]More.
[193:59.47]More.
[194:00.97]More.
[194:03.79]Give me the ball.
[194:09.37]Hey, wow, would you look at that?
[194:10.81]I can't believe you guys won.
[194:12.41]You actually did it.
[194:13.99]Holy crap.
[194:15.03]Holy heck.
[194:16.84]You got a point.
[194:17.62]You got three points there.
[194:18.72]Holy heck-a-rito.
[194:19.86]I can't believe it.
[194:23.00]So coming up next is another group of clowns.
[194:32.25]We've got Cuddles.
[194:33.87]We've got Miss Partly Polite.
[194:36.73]There they go.
[194:38.13]Bring them out.
[194:49.21]Wait, am I on camera?
[194:51.38]Oh shit, I'm on camera.
[194:54.54]Hey, we got cuddles in Polypolite.
[195:02.85]We've gotta go to those two.
[195:04.19]Let's do it.
[195:14.51]You unpack it, put it on the train, and bring it over to me.
[195:17.21]I'm gonna get ready.
[195:18.84]Alright, alright, alright.
[195:23.78]I need my bag.
[195:40.12]Okay, any time now.
[196:02.91]Put it on the tray and bring it over to me.
[196:25.89]I've got it all ready for you now.
[196:28.81]I've got the bandana and everything.
[196:34.49]Magic in a box.
[196:38.25]This is the magic bandana trick.
[197:00.51]The Acme Company wants to thank you for purchasing this month's trick in a box.
[197:07.15]Empty the contents onto a tray and place it in front of you.
[197:13.99]Now, we're going to learn some magic.
[197:20.57]We're going to make bandana disappear.
[197:26.97]First, pick up the bandana.
[197:33.52]Now fold it in half.
[197:38.29]That's right, fold it in half.
[197:47.93]Now fold it one more time.
[197:58.03]Take the folded bandana and secretly hide it in your left hand.
[198:07.53]Keep your hand in a natural position.
[198:10.96]This is known as palming.
[198:16.88]Open up the folded bandana.
[198:21.84]Greet the audience by waving it up and down.
[198:30.66]Okay.
[198:33.36]To prove it's a real bandana, why don't you wipe your face with it?
[198:41.50]Or use it to blow your nose.
[198:51.72]Pick up the red scarf.
[199:04.97]Now gather the four corners together and make a pouch.
[199:18.89]Doing okay?
[199:33.56]Fold the bandana on the same lines that you previously folded it.
[199:41.13]When you have done that, place the bandana in the pouch.
[199:51.10]Squeeze it tightly.
[200:02.92]What the audience doesn't know is that you never really put the bandana in the pouch.
[200:11.16]You kept it in your left hand, right?
[200:14.85]Remember palming?
[200:28.23]Make a magical gesture over the bag and fling it open and await your just applause.
[200:43.01]Where's the bandanas?
[200:43.89]They're all gone now.
[200:45.87]The bandanas gone?
[200:47.84]I ate it.
[200:48.32]You ate your bandanas?
[200:51.08]Yeah.
[200:52.14]Well, I'll tell you, I'll tell you what.
[200:54.90]No, I'll tell you what.
[200:56.34]They look over there because I've got something over here.
[200:59.02]You can turn around and look at me, see?
[201:01.21]Because I want to show you something that I've got.
[201:06.73]Can you see that right there?
[201:08.35]Oh, I can see that.
[201:09.45]I can see that.
[201:10.17]Basically, there's just all of these cards here.
[201:14.53]Now, I want you to concentrate on one of the cards.
[201:16.79]Now, I don't care which card it is.
[201:18.49]Don't tell me.
[201:19.05]Don't tell me.
[201:20.77]I'm going to pick a card.
[201:22.05]I'm going to pick.
[201:22.53]I'm going to pick.
[201:23.05]You don't need to spin around.
[201:24.15]Just pick the card.
[201:28.72]Never mind.
[201:29.30]Don't tell me.
[201:30.98]I got it!
[201:32.22]Well, you're pointing at it.
[201:33.30]That's not good because, you know, see what I'm going to do is I'm going to make that card disappear.
[201:38.05]Because you're going to look at me.
[201:39.63]Yes, you are.
[201:39.99]You're going to look up right there at me.
[201:42.81]Yeah, and you're going to concentrate on the card that you picked.
[201:46.59]Right, yes, stop.
[201:47.55]Not so close.
[201:48.81]I don't trust you.
[201:50.13]Just concentrate on the card, yeah.
[201:53.32]Polly polite.
[201:54.00]Yeah, you be very polite.
[201:55.06]Yes, you is.
[201:55.60]Alright, concentrate.
[201:56.84]You're concentrating on it.
[201:59.12]Alright, I'm gonna make it disappear.
[202:07.49]Is your card there?
[202:08.73]Oh!
[202:09.79]Oh!
[202:10.83]Somebody stole my card, Cuddles!
[202:13.35]It's gone!
[202:13.69]No, it's because I'm smart and I'm very smart.
[202:17.09]Oh, my card is gone!
[202:18.53]I'm a magician.
[202:19.23]I'm a very, very, very good magician.
[202:21.44]You're pretty smart up here.
[202:24.12]You know that?
[202:25.72]Pretty smart.
[202:27.26]You respect your elders.
[202:28.18]Right.
[202:29.34]Okay, well, that's all for right now because I think I'm going to have to get rid of some of that banana.
[202:35.31]Yeah.
[202:36.21]No, okay.
[202:36.87]See ya.
[202:37.31]Bye.
[202:37.45]I like that trick.
[202:41.53]I like that trick a lot.
[202:43.75]Okay.
[202:52.05]Oh, no.
[202:59.14]What is this?
[203:05.77]I think Cuddles used the wrong one.
[203:12.91]Used the wrong one.
[203:15.09]Oh, hi, Cuddles.
[203:17.91]Hi, Cuddles.
[203:20.55]Well, here, wipe it off.
[203:23.99]You can wipe.
[203:26.82]I gotta go get some water.
[203:28.74]I want some water.
[203:29.58]You can get your own water.
[203:31.62]Okay, I can get my own water.
[203:33.12]Alright, thank you very much.
[203:34.92]Thank you very much.
[203:36.15]You're so nice to me.
[203:38.25]Okay, food.
[203:41.19]You know, I gotta tell you, I don't think she's got it yet.
[203:45.93]She did pretty good on that trip, though.
[203:48.67]The secret is, is I never gave her the pandemic.
[203:52.82]Oh!
[203:55.44]fell off the tree and she didn't even know.
[203:59.44]But I gotta tell you, I took a banana because I was gonna eat it.
[204:05.16]I'm hungry.
[204:06.23]It's been a long day and I'm really tired.
[204:11.03]But she took the banana and she went like this.
[204:16.17]She folded it like that.
[204:21.02]And I can't eat it because now it's a folded banana.
[204:27.32]And I don't know what happened to the yellow bandana.
[204:30.30]It disappeared.
[204:31.18]Thank you very much.
[204:38.37]I can bring you back over here to the carnival section, the arcade section of the stream.
[204:43.43]Thank you again.
[204:43.94]That was Cuddles and Polly for Light.
[204:46.79]Doing great work over there as the two best clowns, probably in the universe.
[204:50.99]I still got, I got, I got paint all over me still.
[204:53.63]Anyways, what kind of, we're going to be playing Pac-Man for a little bit because we're in the arcade now.
[204:58.29]Welcome back to the Jerma985 arcade experience.
[205:01.62]As you see, we got Pac-Man and Pac-Man Plus.
[205:03.44]We're going to play, this is a video game stream, right?
[205:06.40]Sometimes has to be for a little bit.
[205:09.66]Do we have audio on this thing?
[205:10.92]Let's find out.
[205:11.50]Does it have audio?
[205:15.68]Can you hear it?
[205:34.97]Don't go for it just yet.
[205:40.83]Bait him around the corner.
[205:41.75]Oh, did you see that fucking play?
[205:42.95]That was the best play I've done all day.
[205:46.60]Remember I told you this didn't work?
[205:48.50]Oh, that was a lie.
[205:52.02]I have one of the top 50.
[205:53.40]Ty, this is so fucking loud.
[205:55.60]I have one of the top 50.
[205:56.84]Okay, I lost, but that's okay because, you know, I have one of the top.
[206:00.97]I don't have any high score.
[206:01.79]I'm just lying.
[206:02.39]Let's go.
[206:04.77]We're doing this for a little bit just so.
[206:07.65]There we go.
[206:08.01]That's better.
[206:08.90]Just so we have an opportunity to set up the next event, which the clowns are.
[206:14.70]The clowns are fucking awesome.
[206:18.24]Give me a break.
[206:23.89]Come in a little tighter.
[206:25.51]I want them to see this.
[206:31.37]You know, they actually sell these.
[206:33.59]They sell these machines at Walmart now.
[206:38.12]And they're really not that expensive.
[206:40.88]You can get one of these for 300 bucks, which is what we did.
[206:43.12]Holy shit, that was good.
[206:57.69]Doesn't even require quarters.
[207:02.53]Come on, level one, level one, level one.
[207:04.11]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[207:13.42]Level one done.
[207:19.06]I've actually never gotten to level two in Pac-Man.
[207:20.72]I don't know what it looks like.
[207:22.54]I guess it looks like this.
[207:32.61]Louder.
[207:36.56]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out.
[207:42.04]I would never do that on screen.
[207:44.10]Or off screen for that matter.
[207:45.56]I lost.
[207:46.06]Alright, I lost, sorry, we'll start over.
[207:52.31]Come on Pac-Man, let's see what you got.
[207:57.65]Don't ever go for the balls first.
[208:01.38]It came off.
[208:01.80]How many things are going to go wrong?
[208:09.67]I don't know.
[208:29.18]One, two, three, four.
[208:32.46]God damn it.
[208:33.26]Get it.
[208:35.76]Yes.
[208:36.18]Inky is faster than everybody.
[208:38.08]I don't need that shit.
[208:40.62]Up.
[208:40.70]Down.
[208:58.48]Right, left, out, up, go.
[209:01.40]No, you guys don't get to play this one.
[209:02.91]This is just me.
[209:03.85]We didn't have the time to set that up, so unfortunately this is just a me thing, not a you thing.
[209:11.39]Sorry.
[209:11.91]Oh, fuck.
[209:26.58]The smallest things are hurting me.
[209:29.00]Got it.
[209:29.66]Two, three, get it.
[209:30.88]What happened?
[209:32.24]What's that?
[209:34.10]What's that mean?
[209:34.68]What does that mean?
[209:35.44]What's the ding, ding, ding mean?
[209:36.36]Did I win something?
[209:37.22]What does it mean?
[209:55.23]I've never seen level three before in Pac-Man, I don't know what it looks like.
[210:03.28]Don't get angry, this is a fucking important stream.
[210:12.28]All the way to the left, up.
[210:15.51]Just go for it, just win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.
[210:29.05]Get it!
[210:29.49]Get the cutscene!
[210:30.01]Quick!
[210:30.63]Get in there quick!
[210:31.33]I want the whole thing.
[210:33.74]Why are you not moving?
[210:39.66]I did it.
[210:40.22]I won.
[210:46.55]Why is it so loose?
[210:48.55]This thing's going to fall off at any moment.
[210:51.29]Seriously.
[210:51.81]Even if I screw it in.
[210:52.55]I fucking ruined it.
[210:54.17]What an idiot.
[210:59.78]Alright, now there's paint on this now.
[211:01.28]I've ruined it.
[211:02.02]That's game over.
[211:09.51]Ah, fuck it.
[211:09.87]I didn't play it again.
[211:11.97]So what's going to happen now is I am going to do something that has never been done before on the platform, on Twitter.
[211:18.40]I'm talking total on Twitch.
[211:20.26]What we're going to do this time
[211:22.40]is we are going to do, sir, you've seen Twitch play Pokémon, you've seen Twitch play, you know, complete Dark Souls, Twitch control robots, but, but, very important, have you ever seen
[211:36.87]Have you ever in your life, and I mean in your entire existence, seen Twitch versus the fucking broadcaster?
[211:48.20]You have not.
[211:49.38]Twitch fights broadcaster with controlled inputs.
[211:52.81]Put it on the screen, please.
[211:55.43]Come on, bring it in.
[211:58.39]Control this thing with your hands.
[212:02.80]Get the commands on screen.
[212:05.83]Twitch fights the guy in real life.
[212:09.40]I'm going to wait for the commands.
[212:10.76]You've got a left punch.
[212:11.66]You've got a right punch.
[212:13.30]Are we ready?
[212:15.76]Tell me when to go.
[212:17.64]Do we have action?
[212:20.45]Are we doing inputs?
[212:22.93]Jesus.
[212:26.65]Ah, shit.
[212:27.59]Ow, my elbow.
[212:31.57]Don't go for the face.
[212:32.33]Don't go for my face.
[212:35.90]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[212:37.20]Stop, stop, stop.
[212:37.88]Stop inputs.
[212:38.38]Stop inputs.
[212:39.72]We didn't even shake hands.
[212:43.20]Please raise the right.
[212:44.44]Thank you.
[212:47.46]Don't trick me here.
[212:50.19]There it is.
[212:51.47]Ow, ow.
[212:51.95]OK.
[212:52.29]Alright.
[212:53.17]Let's go.
[212:54.51]Inputs are taking.
[212:55.35]Let's go.
[212:55.63]Eat that, huh?
[213:04.68]Eat this.
[213:05.24]Eat that.
[213:05.60]Eat this.
[213:06.76]Come on.
[213:07.00]What do you got?
[213:08.04]Right in the face.
[213:08.46]I'll give you a free shot.
[213:09.22]Oh, he lost his head.
[213:18.17]Well, he's regenerated.
[213:19.55]He has regeneration powers.
[213:22.23]Wow, that's unbelievable.
[213:23.59]Come on.
[213:23.95]Right in the face.
[213:24.45]Do A on your keyboard.
[213:30.79]You're going to have 100,000 of you hit A at the same time.
[213:33.49]Alright.
[213:33.81]That was pretty close.
[213:34.83]Pretty good.
[213:36.25]Almost.
[213:37.25]Alright.
[213:37.47]You know what?
[213:38.56]How about this, chat?
[213:39.94]How about this one for you?
[213:41.46]Yeah!
[214:06.09]That means I win.
[214:08.99]You thought you could fight the fucking streamer.
[214:10.65]You thought you could be.
[214:11.31]Give me this.
[214:15.25]Give me this.
[214:25.06]What is this?
[214:34.53]Oh, this looks like some kind of mechanism.
[214:41.06]I win.
[214:42.48]I always win.
[214:43.98]Don't let anybody fool you.
[214:47.00]You got one shot in the face.
[214:48.10]That's all that mattered.
[214:50.06]You lost your head twice.
[214:50.98]And I, like, really, really hurt my hand.
[214:58.53]I have to wear it.
[215:00.65]Do I need to use my right hand anymore?
[215:02.97]Because it seriously hurts.
[215:07.21]God.
[215:13.40]I got you loot.
[215:15.38]Plus one to fucking damage hands.
[215:18.12]I'm going to keep this one on because I really did like, I may have sprained my wrist.
[215:21.92]Because that was a hard punch.
[215:23.82]Somebody fucking sell that on eBay.
[215:26.37]Alright, so now we have
[215:30.42]Another game for you to play.
[215:34.45]Oh God.
[215:35.77]Stay there please, don't fall down.
[215:37.91]The next game is a classic.
[215:43.19]We're gonna move on to the milk bottles.
[215:48.44]Milk bottle game.
[215:49.64]See you over there.
[215:53.48]So this one, all you have to do
[215:58.66]Ladies and gentlemen, you just have to knock the bottles down.
[216:03.75]Right in the middle.
[216:06.01]If you can do that, you win.
[216:08.95]Take them all down.
[216:11.39]The controls are on the screen.
[216:14.81]Can you do it?
[216:16.91]Let me get back.
[216:21.06]There it goes.
[216:23.92]Right in the middle.
[216:28.29]Right in the center.
[216:34.66]Looks a lot easier than it is.
[216:37.38]I can assure you.
[216:40.58]It's aiming directly at me.
[216:45.11]Right in the center.
[216:47.09]You can do it.
[216:49.15]You just have to take him down.
[216:53.01]Probably shouldn't be standing there.
[217:00.01]That's way too far.
[217:02.12]Where are you going?
[217:10.08]Are you going into the sky?
[217:11.20]What the hell are you guys doing?
[217:18.06]I got a net here.
[217:19.98]I am in complete control.
[217:21.69]Yeah, there's a net here.
[217:23.97]Funny, though.
[217:25.21]Would have been funny.
[217:26.99]No, I'm protected.
[217:28.71]Just want to see your reaction when you hit it.
[217:30.89]Because I want to see it fly back.
[217:36.32]Get it in the middle.
[217:36.94]Remember, only when it's green.
[217:58.35]Come on.
[218:00.75]No.
[218:04.69]Pull it in tighter.
[218:06.49]You got to go much tighter than that.
[218:08.29]Otherwise, it's never going to happen.
[218:11.01]But the target's so much bigger.
[218:12.35]OK.
[218:12.73]But the last one like this, the down the clown, there was a small little section.
[218:18.24]You can hit anywhere on these cans.
[218:20.80]Just hit a can.
[218:23.52]Anywhere.
[218:25.28]Anywhere.
[218:25.72]Right in the middle, preferably.
[218:28.66]Should do it.
[218:33.20]Look, I'll be, look, right in my face, come on.
[218:38.40]Right in the center.
[218:41.54]That looks good.
[218:42.96]That looks good.
[218:46.92]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, too high.
[218:51.41]Down, bring it down.
[218:54.47]Oh!
[218:56.27]Darn it!
[218:57.71]Darn it!
[219:00.25]Darn it, that wasn't, you almost had it.
[219:03.08]That was close, very close, very close.
[219:06.24]Let me help you out here.
[219:09.16]You did manage to get one though, that's good.
[219:11.80]You did manage to get that one.
[219:12.92]Let me help him to get it back stacked up here.
[219:16.83]Nice try.
[219:19.11]Darn it, that's unfortunate.
[219:22.39]Too bad, try it again.
[219:26.98]That was close.
[219:29.09]Closer than I got last time I tried this.
[219:37.95]You got the top one though, that's still good.
[219:40.41]It's not bad.
[219:49.05]Still doesn't count.
[219:51.15]Still does not count, unfortunately.
[219:55.03]Not, oh, I'm getting stuck.
[219:58.84]I'll leave it off.
[220:01.02]I'll leave that can off.
[220:02.06]I mean, you just hit the top of it.
[220:03.28]You gotta get the whole thing.
[220:05.30]You can't just hit it right at the top.
[220:09.14]You've got it.
[220:09.62]Look, let me show you something here.
[220:11.60]It's important.
[220:12.90]Look at this.
[220:16.54]So if you hit this thing here, now people think this game is rigged, right?
[220:21.29]Which I mean, obviously you would think that if you were,
[220:24.93]You know, your mind was a lot slower than mine was.
[220:29.01]If you don't hit it directly in the center, these things weigh like 45 pounds, right?
[220:35.48]So this whole thing is like about 50 pounds.
[220:36.96]So you got like four, eight, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32,
[220:43.85]And then a higher one, like 40.
[220:45.90]They're very heavy, so you can't just, you can't just hit one at the top.
[220:49.80]You gotta get it right in the center mass, like right here.
[220:52.84]If you don't do that, it's not gonna fall over.
[220:55.74]Somebody probably says, prove it, prove it, but I want you to do it.
[220:58.06]I don't wanna do it.
[220:59.82]You've dented them, they're very heavy.
[221:01.93]Look.
[221:03.47]See?
[221:04.53]You see how fucking heavy this is?
[221:07.97]You gotta go from straight on directly in the middle.
[221:12.66]Not going to work unless you do it that way.
[221:14.34]I'll leave the top one off.
[221:21.25]And you broke it.
[221:22.99]Second time today.
[221:25.29]You guys are going too hard.
[221:27.71]You popped out the sphincter.
[221:32.94]Just realizing live the word I just used.
[221:37.66]But that's kind of what happened.
[221:39.32]I saw it come out.
[221:41.55]and popped out in the sphincter.
[221:45.21]I think that's actually the technical term for the whole thing.
[221:49.21]Maybe.
[221:49.55]I'm not sure.
[221:52.03]Hey, want to see this?
[221:53.99]How about this?
[222:01.94]Can I not do that, really?
[222:06.08]Let's kill some time.
[222:14.32]How the fuck do people learn how to do this?
[222:16.42]I don't know.
[222:18.54]Can I do three?
[222:23.06]No, no, not a chance in hell.
[222:25.16]I'll try to do three.
[222:35.13]From my understanding, you have to do, no, that's not gonna happen.
[222:40.77]I wish I could just chat.
[222:41.62]What are they saying?
[222:46.28]What are they saying right now?
[222:47.70]I wonder.
[222:49.20]I wonder what things they're screaming at me.
[222:52.02]Jeremy, what the fuck is happening?
[222:54.25]Why can't we play the damn game?
[222:56.59]And I'll just very quickly, there's another balloon popped off camera.
[222:59.67]We've had like a balloon pop like every 15 seconds.
[223:01.67]I'm not sure if you can pick it up on the microphones or not.
[223:05.07]Jeremy, I want to throw the ball at the can.
[223:07.88]And I know you do.
[223:08.66]Trust me, I do too.
[223:11.20]Here's me, look, those of you that say that I'm bald, if you want to take a look at the, take, sure, take a look.
[223:17.93]That's as far back as it goes.
[223:20.65]You're getting real Jeremy Elbridge, there's no substitute right now.
[223:30.04]If it wasn't so windy, oh well.
[223:34.14]What are you gonna do?
[223:36.70]I can see you getting that close.
[223:39.36]Pull it back.
[223:40.36]Get the whole image.
[223:42.17]Let me go like this.
[223:48.38]We're trying to fix it.
[223:52.43]This robot has seen hell.
[223:55.37]It's gotten a ton of inputs.
[223:57.67]The server crashed like three times, but it still worked.
[224:01.35]And it still works very well.
[224:03.33]This thing is a modern Marvel of engineering.
[224:06.79]It's just taking thousands of inputs at the same exact time.
[224:09.89]So, one of the things gets busted, they fix it, and we keep going.
[224:13.74]Not a problem.
[224:16.66]And I think, ladies and gentlemen, I think we're gonna be, we are gonna be close soon.
[224:34.59]Let's go!
[224:43.38]Oh shit.
[224:44.76]I hear it moving!
[224:50.10]I'm getting the fuck out of the way.
[224:52.74]When I hear that noise, it's just like, alright, time to get, I'm time to move.
[225:00.65]Please don't hit me.
[225:15.35]Boom.
[225:18.92]Knock it down.
[225:21.04]You had plenty of downtime there.
[225:22.40]You had at least a two minute, three minute downtime.
[225:25.34]Maybe five minutes.
[225:27.20]Knock it down.
[225:28.68]Get those bottles.
[225:30.24]Get those 45 pound cans.
[225:31.94]The wind's picking up.
[225:36.23]Can you compensate for the wind, I wonder?
[225:47.70]Oh!
[226:04.04]You can see them.
[226:07.44]Oh, those 45 pound cans are really, really taking a beating.
[226:15.69]As you can very reliably tell.
[226:18.99]I don't think you guys are capable of knocking the cans down.
[226:21.77]It's very hard.
[226:35.56]Three seconds.
[226:37.16]Can't you do it?
[226:49.95]Look at this thing.
[226:52.67]Oh, too bad.
[226:53.61]You guys don't get the Wailord prize.
[226:56.39]Oh, shit.
[226:56.69]I'm stuck.
[226:57.07]It's a spider web.
[226:57.79]Oh, they're going to kill me.
[227:06.96]Just like the real thing.
[227:09.52]You can't fucking do it.
[227:12.53]I win.
[227:13.23]I win.
[227:19.49]Don't ever play this game with the carnival because it's impossible.
[227:23.25]You cannot win this game.
[227:24.95]It's not completable.
[227:26.83]It isn't.
[227:28.35]They weigh them down.
[227:30.81]We don't do that here.
[227:32.75]Absolutely not.
[227:41.93]OK.
[227:42.03]Does that technically count as a win?
[228:07.11]That doesn't count!
[228:09.37]I don't know if that's a count or not.
[228:11.29]Should it be?
[228:17.48]No, that counts.
[228:19.22]That counts.
[228:21.04]That's a count.
[228:21.56]Hey, welcome to the carnival!
[228:37.47]Where even when you rig the game, it don't matter because they'll find a way.
[228:49.02]Alright, so we are moving towards another game.
[228:55.82]But before we do, we are going to complete this whole arc here.
[229:02.75]We're going to go back to, who do you think
[229:06.81]Where are we going?
[229:08.63]I wanna see it spammed in chat before I go anywhere.
[229:11.95]Who's coming back out here?
[229:13.76]Hm?
[229:13.86]What do you think?
[229:16.92]Is it a dog?
[229:18.44]No.
[229:19.16]Is it a cat?
[229:19.78]No.
[229:21.44]No, who could possibly be coming out onto the main stage to perform for you guys?
[229:32.18]That's fucking awesome.
[229:33.91]So, let's move it over.
[229:37.13]Once again, to Cuddles and Polly Polite.
[229:44.42]Hey, Polly, bring that box over here.
[229:47.42]I got it.
[229:48.04]I got it right here.
[229:50.92]Oh.
[229:51.70]Oh, no.
[229:52.22]Oh, no.
[229:52.93]Oh, no.
[229:54.99]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[229:55.93]Here.
[229:56.05]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[229:57.61]Right here.
[229:57.97]Put them inside this bag here.
[229:58.93]We'll pick them up and we'll put them inside the bag.
[230:00.47]No.
[230:00.57]What are you doing?
[230:10.12]I'm picking him up.
[230:13.46]I'm picking him up.
[230:14.20]Whoa, I got you.
[230:15.74]I'm picking him up.
[230:17.06]Well, I said put him in the bag.
[230:18.48]Okay.
[230:19.24]Alright.
[230:19.76]Alright.
[230:21.08]Alright.
[230:21.58]Okay.
[230:22.94]Yes, ma'am.
[230:25.75]You know what?
[230:26.23]You want to play a game.
[230:27.21]Balls.
[230:27.53]I want to play a game.
[230:28.77]I want to play a fun game.
[230:30.89]Put all the balls right there in the bag, and then we'll play a game.
[230:33.59]I promise.
[230:34.41]I promise.
[230:35.68]I said, pick them up.
[230:40.92]That's what I said.
[230:42.12]I was being very nice and now you're not being very nice.
[230:47.18]And then we'll play a game.
[230:49.63]Okay?
[230:51.07]Alright.
[230:52.07]Any time now.
[230:53.67]Okay.
[231:00.85]Okay, I'm ready to play.
[231:02.69]I'm ready to play a game.
[231:03.91]I'm ready to play a game.
[231:04.75]Alright.
[231:05.49]Alright.
[231:07.49]Alright.
[231:08.79]Stop.
[231:09.01]Hold on.
[231:10.29]I'll explain to you what's going to happen.
[231:12.13]I'm going to hold the bag up like this.
[231:14.15]You know what?
[231:15.62]All the colors in the balls are.
[231:16.82]What do we put colors?
[231:17.92]What colors do we put?
[231:20.22]Red?
[231:20.46]Yellow?
[231:22.40]Orange, green, and all those colors.
[231:26.14]Colors of the rainbow.
[231:28.96]Now what you're going to have to do is I'm going to hold the bag up here just like this.
[231:32.38]I want you to come over here, and I want you to pick up a ball.
[231:36.29]One ball.
[231:36.63]Don't show me what it is.
[231:38.65]Never mind.
[231:39.65]Can I look?
[231:40.79]Not in the bag.
[231:42.91]Alright, you took a ball.
[231:44.51]Now what I'm going to do is hold still.
[231:49.03]I'm going to hold the bag up just like this.
[231:51.55]I'm going to reach right in there just like this, and I'm going to get them all.
[231:55.11]I've now got one in my hand, okay?
[231:57.15]Ready?
[231:58.19]Are you ready?
[232:00.21]One, two, three.
[232:01.93]Hey, we did it.
[232:03.83]Oh, I'm so smart.
[232:04.95]I'm so smart.
[232:06.87]That was pretty smart.
[232:08.57]That was pretty smart.
[232:10.21]I'm going to hold the bag up again.
[232:11.71]Easy does it.
[232:12.97]I want you to reach right in there, and I want you to get them all out.
[232:22.31]I saw what that was.
[232:23.34]Put it back in there.
[232:24.20]Okay.
[232:25.63]Pick out a ball.
[232:29.31]Alright, you got a ball.
[232:30.37]I got a ball.
[232:30.81]I got one.
[232:31.37]So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to hold the bag up just like this, and I'm going to reach right inside there, and I'm going to get a ball.
[232:37.29]Alright, run around so you can't see.
[232:39.65]Alright, now are you ready to say one, two, three?
[232:41.80]I'm ready.
[232:42.32]You ready?
[232:42.70]I'm ready.
[232:43.28]You ready?
[232:43.70]One, two, three.
[232:44.46]One, two, three.
[232:45.86]Oh, see, I told you I was smart.
[232:48.76]Oh, yeah, I'm good.
[232:51.04]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[232:52.52]So alright, put it down inside there.
[232:53.70]Okay, okay, one more time.
[232:57.42]One more time.
[232:58.68]I'm holding the bag up.
[233:01.02]Hey, come on.
[233:07.65]You took the ball.
[233:08.51]Now I'm going to take the ball.
[233:12.81]I got my ball.
[233:14.69]You got your ball?
[233:15.65]Yeah.
[233:16.27]I got my ball.
[233:17.37]Alright.
[233:17.95]You ready to show your ball?
[233:19.41]Yeah.
[233:19.93]I'm ready to show mine.
[233:22.46]Oh.
[233:29.82]I can't get over that, that I'm so smart.
[233:31.86]I can't believe that I did that.
[233:33.84]Oh boy, that's good.
[233:36.46]Now I'll show you something else if you'd be alive.
[233:38.34]Would you like to see?
[233:39.26]Okay.
[233:39.84]I'm ready.
[233:40.48]Show me.
[233:40.88]Well, I will.
[233:41.78]I want to see.
[233:42.20]Okay.
[233:42.77]Can you turn this right there?
[233:44.95]See, these are my little docuseries.
[233:47.41]Yeah.
[233:48.13]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[233:50.49]If you can count, I'm glad of that.
[233:52.57]Now what I want you to do...
[233:54.62]I'm going to make a prediction.
[233:55.84]When I make this prediction, I know which duckie you're going to choose.
[234:01.38]You think you do.
[234:02.52]Yes, I do.
[234:03.57]So I'm going to take my prediction.
[234:05.71]There's my prediction.
[234:07.23]And I'm going to put it right down there inside the box.
[234:09.55]Okay.
[234:10.17]Alright.
[234:10.59]I'm going to pick.
[234:11.77]Yes, you can do that.
[234:14.35]Come on.
[234:14.77]The duckie.
[234:24.34]No, you have to come over here and pick up the ducky.
[234:29.00]Which ducky are you going to pick up?
[234:33.43]I want.
[234:34.33]Come on, pick it up that way.
[234:36.07]Alright, so you pick it up.
[234:37.89]Now, would you look at the ducky's bottom?
[234:42.45]What's on the ducky's bottom, please?
[234:44.05]There's a number.
[234:45.07]Yeah, there's a number.
[234:46.03]And what's that number?
[234:51.02]They don't care.
[234:52.18]I care.
[234:53.40]See, we got one, two, three, four, five, six.
[234:56.12]But look at that.
[234:56.92]Number three is missing.
[234:58.01]You got a number three on the bottom of your ducky?
[235:06.17]I do.
[235:07.24]I do.
[235:08.24]Where's my prediction?
[235:09.56]Yeah, I got a prediction.
[235:11.14]Okay.
[235:12.16]Let's see.
[235:12.64]Right here.
[235:16.87]It's a three.
[235:17.97]That's right, it says a three.
[235:19.79]What's it say?
[235:20.60]It says this was the ducky that will be wearing the pink sweater with a pink and blue hat.
[235:31.05]I got it, yeah.
[235:32.17]What?
[235:33.19]Yeah, and if you hadn't been dancing around, you know what?
[235:36.28]I was gonna stick a $20 bill in there just to get you going.
[235:40.14]But see, you were just, no, you were just jumping up and down and you made me forget.
[235:45.12]So now forget it, forget it.
[235:48.15]Yeah, right.
[235:51.23]I'll take my ducky boots.
[235:51.99]Thank you very much.
[235:53.49]Thank you very much.
[235:54.53]Okay, here we go.
[235:55.85]Take them.
[235:56.54]On my way.
[235:57.76]I'm thinking of how smart I am now.
[235:59.68]You want to play the boat?
[236:00.60]You want to play the boat?
[236:01.90]I'm the polite one.
[236:02.79]I like to play the boat.
[236:03.83]Let's go.
[236:25.04]Hey, well, can you believe it?
[236:46.71]Thank you again.
[236:48.61]Thank you.
[236:50.13]Thank you.
[236:51.54]We have a very special, special treat for you here.
[236:54.12]This is the final game of the evening, if you were curious.
[236:57.82]What's that?
[236:58.50]What's that?
[236:58.90]Final game?
[236:59.80]Final game?
[237:00.36]The final game is going to be the crane.
[237:02.74]We have a crane here.
[237:06.00]We have a crane here.
[237:07.97]And the crane is going to be controlled by you guys in chat.
[237:16.57]And I hope you can get prizes.
[237:19.81]There are various prizes in here for you to collect.
[237:22.99]You are in control of the game.
[237:24.69]It is you.
[237:26.39]You've got the claw.
[237:27.49]You've got the button.
[237:28.33]You've got the timer.
[237:29.19]Try to grab whatever prizes you possibly can in the time limit.
[237:33.97]This is the last game of the evening.
[237:35.25]But that's not true.
[237:38.03]I'm a liar.
[237:39.21]I'm a pretty bad liar.
[237:40.40]So enjoy the crane game.
[237:42.24]Have fun with it.
[237:42.82]Try to get a good prize.
[237:44.66]I will see you guys in a moment.
[237:55.72]Let's see if we can get something.
[237:59.20]Camera back.
[238:00.46]Crane back.
[238:01.60]Crane back.
[238:02.58]Crane toward.
[238:03.22]Crane left.
[238:03.74]Crane right.
[238:05.06]Got a bunch of various prizes in here that look good.
[238:07.44]Did you just get one?
[238:09.23]No, you didn't really just get one right off the bat, did you?
[238:11.27]Did you get a panda right?
[238:11.97]No, you didn't.
[238:13.29]They didn't just really get it right off the bat.
[238:16.55]No, they didn't.
[238:17.01]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[238:24.73]They won.
[238:25.39]The first try.
[238:26.07]They got it first try.
[238:26.97]You did it first try.
[238:28.71]Really?
[238:30.25]Well, do it again.
[238:30.91]OK.
[238:33.23]That was pretty.
[238:34.33]Wait, is it a pant?
[238:35.00]No, it's a cat.
[238:40.58]Wait, what?
[238:41.40]Hold on.
[238:41.84]Hold on, there was a prize in here.
[238:45.64]What are you going for, the goat?
[238:51.41]I picked up the wrong prize.
[238:55.80]No, you did it again.
[238:56.85]You got it again.
[239:02.83]Holy shit.
[239:04.87]Wow.
[239:11.63]You didn't get this.
[239:14.07]Where's the panda?
[239:17.40]What the fuck is this?
[239:18.34]Oh, there it is.
[239:21.42]You guys are good at this shit, apparently.
[239:23.42]Nice work.
[239:32.24]Going for another goat?
[239:38.24]You guys aren't going to be four for four.
[239:41.76]Is this too easy?
[239:44.18]No, nothing.
[239:45.38]Sorry.
[239:46.32]Not that time.
[239:47.08]Not that time.
[239:53.68]You can see me.
[239:55.26]You can see all.
[239:55.80]Look at you.
[240:02.23]There are some rare prizes in here, as there always are.
[240:07.71]You got some orange and blue stuff.
[240:09.63]I think that's a Fortnite pinata.
[240:12.33]I know a lot of you guys like that game.
[240:15.12]I mean, I would be going for the Fortnite pinata on the right side.
[240:19.50]It's dropping.
[240:20.12]Where's it going?
[240:20.86]No, it's going to get caught.
[240:23.44]Yeah, what?
[240:24.28]No, did it?
[240:26.48]Do you guys like Fortnite?
[240:35.32]Oh, I was trying to get it.
[240:37.40]Never mind.
[240:40.96]No, you didn't get it, unfortunately.
[240:42.66]But you guys have a few prizes here.
[240:44.04]You got a wheel, a cat, a panda, a goat.
[240:46.42]I'm gonna put these down here.
[240:51.24]Only do the commands when it's green!
[241:00.11]Zero!
[241:03.91]Oh, they're going for Fortnite.
[241:08.53]Are they going to get in there?
[241:09.31]Oh, shit.
[241:16.67]Another goat.
[241:20.75]Really?
[241:25.29]Winner.
[241:31.72]I'm keeping all these, by the way.
[241:37.14]Goated.
[241:38.53]The controls are inverted.
[241:41.55]Good.
[241:41.87]Extra hard.
[241:42.41]Remember, toward is toward the screen.
[241:51.50]Back is back towards the mirror.
[241:57.00]Thank you, Invader Lur, for the five community subs.
[241:59.86]Appreciate that.
[242:00.92]You almost got something there.
[242:01.86]What are those?
[242:04.30]Close.
[242:07.34]Those are socks.
[242:09.75]some type of video game that has an RPG from the video game Nintendo.
[242:19.56]That's a Nintendo sock game.
[242:24.26]It's alright though.
[242:25.14]I don't know if you'll get it or not.
[242:26.08]I don't know if it's worth it.
[242:30.16]Going for Fortnite!
[242:33.64]Drop it!
[242:39.87]Oh!
[242:41.33]Is it gonna happen?
[242:42.21]People are saying the controls are inverted.
[242:52.29]Why inverted?
[242:56.70]Yeah, S, guys, remember, S is towards the screen.
[243:00.44]W is back, towards the back of the machine.
[243:04.78]When you press S, it's coming forward, like toward you.
[243:10.86]A should be left, D should be right.
[243:14.54]And thank you 8bitzig for the five community subs.
[243:16.69]Appreciate that.
[243:17.15]I love that you guys like the pretend Fortnite thing rather than the Pikachu socks that I've been lying about for a year and a half.
[243:28.23]It's kind of surprising to me.
[243:29.23]I said the word Fortnite.
[243:30.21]Really, another goat.
[243:34.04]OK.
[243:42.95]They're saying A and D is inverted.
[243:46.73]Is A and D inverted?
[243:49.17]It shouldn't be.
[243:50.83]There's no way to change that.
[243:53.15]D is left.
[243:54.57]A is right, apparently.
[243:55.80]A for Pikachu.
[244:05.46]It's not inverted.
[244:06.22]I'm being lied to.
[244:07.04]OK, well, that's fine.
[244:16.21]What's that?
[244:18.51]Oh!
[244:19.95]You've got Jake from Adventure Time.
[244:22.11]Another balloon just popped.
[244:29.01]Nice work.
[244:29.71]Seriously.
[244:30.15]Oh, there's the panda.
[244:36.22]Take a look at this shit.
[244:39.84]That's the first thing you won.
[244:41.16]I know I'm in the way, but you got two goats.
[244:46.13]Wait, what happened to the thing you just won?
[244:51.73]It's not even in here.
[244:53.21]Where the fuck is it?
[244:55.17]I don't see it in here.
[244:57.68]Uh-oh.
[244:59.12]No!
[245:00.72]Are you going to get it?
[245:01.50]Oh!
[245:06.90]They got it!
[245:10.40]No!
[245:10.92]Drop it!
[245:11.44]Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop!
[245:15.27]Oh!
[245:22.66]You did it.
[245:24.66]Congratulations.
[245:27.04]I'll put them on.
[245:29.20]You got the Pikachu socks.
[245:30.90]Congratulations, guys.
[245:31.98]Excellent work.
[245:33.55]Nice job.
[245:36.99]I have to show them.
[245:42.53]Get the Fortnite thing.
[245:45.33]Come on.
[245:54.30]Get the Fortnite goat, whatever that video game is.
[245:58.08]No, nice try.
[246:00.48]Getting more goats.
[246:07.15]Turns out, out of the four plus hours we've been doing this, you guys have been better at the crane game than anything else, and you got the Pikachu socks.
[246:13.88]Congratulations.
[246:15.16]Nice work.
[246:17.10]But can you get the not licensed
[246:20.77]Bottom of the shelf at the grocery store, cereal, non-branded Captain Crunch character that is Fortnite.
[246:26.73]Can you get it?
[246:27.33]I wonder.
[246:30.77]Can you get the off-brand Fortnite?
[246:32.22]This is not Fortnite.
[246:33.10]Don't sue me.
[246:34.92]Thing.
[246:35.96]I don't know.
[246:38.70]I don't know.
[246:40.00]Can they get it?
[246:46.53]The suspense is killing me.
[246:50.08]Another goat.
[246:53.98]You've got to get the orange Fortnite character.
[247:02.04]Just wait a second.
[247:03.09]Hold on.
[247:03.37]Get Fortnite.
[247:21.01]I love that game.
[247:21.97]I love building and jumping and firing my shotgun.
[247:26.79]Is this the one?
[247:32.91]No.
[247:33.73]That's another goat.
[247:39.35]No way.
[247:41.26]No.
[247:41.62]No.
[247:43.20]No.
[247:49.81]Remember, three goats get you a dab.
[247:51.13]Oh, five.
[247:53.53]Sorry.
[247:54.95]We already have three.
[248:05.23]Oh, this is so fun.
[248:10.49]Come on.
[248:12.31]Get a good prize.
[248:13.17]Now you guys are going for the goats.
[248:23.02]Are you gonna get every goat that's in here?
[248:26.89]No, sorry.
[248:29.89]Goat spotted is one of the things we're seeing here.
[248:34.57]Sorry.
[248:36.89]When less are available to grab, they get harder to get.
[248:40.09]What do you mean rigged?
[248:45.48]It's not rigged.
[248:46.86]You guys, you got like seven prizes.
[248:49.44]How is this rigged?
[248:52.12]Oh, it's rigged.
[248:53.20]You pulled out like eight things.
[249:00.55]Alright, come on, let's see it.
[249:02.83]Get the off-brand cereal Fortnite.
[249:08.04]No, you went for the goat.
[249:11.72]You didn't.
[249:16.16]OK.
[249:17.26]Another one.
[249:18.12]Good job.
[249:19.68]It's going to drop.
[249:20.46]It's going to drop.
[249:21.02]It's going to drop.
[249:22.76]Shit.
[249:23.60]Alright, we got it.
[249:27.10]Here we go.
[249:27.44]There you go.
[249:29.62]You won it.
[249:30.50]Nice job.
[249:31.36]And there's Jake from Finn and Jake fucking throw swords at monsters, whatever that show is called.
[249:41.17]Better than anything else today, funnily enough.
[249:45.57]Chat is very good at grabbing stuff out of a box.
[249:50.01]Not so good at firing a ball or flipping a ball into a hole.
[249:56.38]But very, very good at putting a crane down.
[250:01.70]Did they get it?
[250:03.50]Oh, no.
[250:07.36]Almost.
[250:08.88]You had a chance.
[250:14.24]Guys, I'm telling you right now, I'm not stopping this to get me a Fortnite.
[250:19.31]We're not moving on till I get a Fortnite.
[250:22.05]I gotta stop saying that before I get in trouble.
[250:25.03]A neon orange.
[250:30.29]Jolly Rancher, but that's a brand too.
[250:32.25]I can't say that.
[250:34.03]What's a non-branded orange thing?
[250:37.62]Orange.
[250:39.30]It's just orange, okay.
[250:40.92]An orange dog.
[250:42.82]I can just say that apparently.
[250:46.04]What do you got?
[250:48.52]Pull it up.
[250:51.82]Oh, they got another cat.
[250:55.10]You guys are pretty good at this.
[251:01.36]Cute.
[251:02.93]By the way, all these are going to my office.
[251:06.56]There you go.
[251:08.40]Nice job.
[251:09.02]Nice work.
[251:11.26]All these are going up in my office.
[251:14.44]Whatever you guys pull out of here.
[251:16.72]Anything.
[251:18.40]It's going to be a goat office at this point.
[251:24.64]There's like a zebra in the back.
[251:25.79]You haven't gone for the zebra?
[251:27.81]Come on.
[251:34.25]They want it, but I don't know if they're going to get it.
[251:36.51]They want it, but they're not going to get it.
[251:39.19]Is that a double prize?
[251:41.18]That's a PogChamp right there.
[251:43.58]That's a Garfield.
[251:45.34]That's an orange Garfield and a unicorn.
[251:47.80]I think they got a double prize.
[251:49.36]Are they going to do it?
[251:50.82]Oh, you got to be kidding me.
[251:54.50]You got the orange fucking Fortnite Garfield, and you got the unicorn.
[251:59.34]Unbelievable.
[252:00.76]That's a double.
[252:04.83]That deserves a dab.
[252:13.57]I'll give it to you.
[252:14.29]You get one.
[252:16.13]It was all over me.
[252:22.75]Fortnite Garfield.
[252:30.12]Don't worry, guys.
[252:31.18]That fucking dumb game will add Garfield probably next.
[252:33.56]You're going to double twice.
[252:36.00]That's a quadruple.
[252:39.38]Holy shit.
[252:44.36]No way.
[252:48.22]Wow, you got two shitty dumb, that game sucks, Fortnite characters.
[253:01.03]That's twice in a row.
[253:02.12]Are you kidding me?
[253:02.82]That's two dabs.
[253:09.38]No, you get one.
[253:10.08]You only get one.
[253:10.94]I'm not doing another one.
[253:11.83]Stop saying Fortnite.
[253:15.85]I say whatever I want.
[253:18.27]This is my carnival.
[253:21.45]Zebra.
[253:21.91]Zebra.
[253:23.22]Oh.
[253:24.12]Almost.
[253:28.07]Can you get the Zebra before we move on?
[253:31.75]Can you?
[253:33.03]Can you get the Zebra before we move on?
[253:38.65]Come on.
[253:43.72]Srolliot.
[253:44.52]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[253:45.52]Appreciate that.
[253:48.90]Do it for Srolliot, please.
[253:52.24]Get Fortnite.
[253:52.94]I stopped saying that.
[253:54.14]Get Orange Garfield.
[253:56.16]Or the zebra, please.
[253:57.68]Make it happen.
[254:02.35]He wants another goat.
[254:03.19]No, we got plenty of goats.
[254:04.69]We don't need any more goats.
[254:07.21]But that looks like maybe what you're going for here.
[254:14.98]There's a lot of prizes, though.
[254:36.79]I can't.
[254:41.08]I can't.
[254:42.72]This is fucking awesome.
[254:44.92]I love every second of this.
[254:46.36]I'm so happy about this.
[254:47.70]I hope you guys had fun.
[254:50.04]I want another goat.
[254:56.14]Get me another goat.
[254:58.93]No, no, no.
[254:59.69]Oh, the seal.
[255:00.41]The seal is important to me.
[255:05.51]This is the last one.
[255:06.73]One more.
[255:07.31]Get either the zebra or the seal.
[255:09.33]That's what I require.
[255:10.28]That's what I demand.
[255:12.60]Get the seal.
[255:13.46]Your last chance.
[255:21.40]I demand the seal.
[255:23.32]Get it for me.
[255:27.87]Get the tail, that's all you need.
[255:32.80]Get the tail.
[255:33.82]I know you got it.
[255:34.42]Oh, you got to be shitting me.
[255:35.84]They went double time on this one.
[255:38.84]You got, is that three?
[255:40.22]Oh, you got it.
[255:42.08]Oh, you got it.
[255:42.78]Oh, you got it.
[255:43.76]Oh, you got it.
[255:44.36]Oh, you got it.
[255:48.26]Oh, you got it.
[255:54.57]There's no way that's three.
[255:55.83]Is it three?
[255:57.01]Holy shit.
[255:57.69]You went out with a bang.
[255:58.53]No way.
[256:00.46]No way.
[256:01.30]It's three?
[256:03.96]One.
[256:09.40]Where is it?
[256:12.18]Wait, what?
[256:13.71]No way.
[256:14.89]This is all you got?
[256:17.07]No.
[256:18.33]What?
[256:20.47]This is it?
[256:20.97]No.
[256:25.36]Shit.
[256:27.24]Alright.
[256:28.84]That's it.
[256:30.53]Calling it there.
[256:31.73]Nice work.
[256:35.29]No, we're not going, this thing's saying go over in my ear.
[256:38.27]Alright.
[256:39.75]We are going to do, we've had some more bits come in.
[256:42.99]Let's maybe go ahead and turn on the money machine one more time.
[256:53.12]See, you guys can't hear this.
[256:55.66]Maybe.
[256:56.06]Maybe you can.
[256:57.24]But every 30 or 40 seconds, a balloon pops.
[257:07.05]Everyone just kind of freezes and goes, what the fuck was that over there?
[257:11.87]But we're going to do the money machine one more time to get the bits from the stream.
[257:16.31]And then we're going to move over to something else.
[257:19.47]Just stay there.
[257:20.01]Don't move.
[257:21.40]Hey, there it goes.
[257:22.24]There's the money.
[257:23.82]How much money was it this time?
[257:26.44]I don't know, like 40 bucks.
[257:28.04]40 bucks?
[257:30.26]40 bucks, that's it?
[257:31.65]Why is it not 4,000?
[257:35.89]I need eye protection so I don't get my eye, like, slit.
[257:48.70]40 bucks?
[257:50.70]No, don't lock me.
[257:51.70]Like, you make it so scary.
[257:53.29]That was another balloon.
[257:58.84]I'm ready to get the money!
[258:47.25]Okay!
[259:21.60]Later.
[259:26.31]We got at least a dollar and one cent.
[259:36.73]You know, we should probably cut the cameras.
[259:41.27]Hold on, just wait a minute.
[259:43.35]I've got, no, don't put this on camera.
[259:54.54]No, they can see it over there.
[259:55.80]They can see it in the mirror.
[259:57.42]Just cut to the, cut to the, it's like 15 bucks.
[260:01.42]Alright, so it's like, we got, we got 15.
[260:08.25]We got, which one is it, this one?
[260:09.97]We got $15.02.
[260:10.23]Congratulations.
[260:10.81]No way, I got a 10.
[260:20.19]I got a 10 here.
[260:23.45]Seal, seal, seal, seal, where?
[260:28.71]Where, what?
[260:29.23]What are you talking about?
[260:32.22]What the fuck are you talking about?
[260:33.04]Seal, where, where?
[260:35.14]Trapped.
[260:37.82]Where's the seal trapped?
[260:40.92]What are you talking about?
[260:43.75]Get the seal, get the seal, foot cam.
[260:45.73]No, where's the seal?
[260:48.36]Free the seal.
[260:51.52]You are on top of that today.
[260:53.86]You are literally like making my life trouble.
[260:59.50]He's just like aiming down.
[261:04.87]It's in the claw machine?
[261:08.09]No, you guys lost, I'm sorry.
[261:09.71]You didn't win.
[261:10.65]So what we're gonna do now is we are going to show you
[261:17.63]Somewhere in the beginning of the stream, you were getting a caricature done of yourself.
[261:21.91]We're going to reveal that and show you what the artist has created.
[261:25.89]If we're going to cut back to, who do you think we're cutting back to?
[261:30.88]Cuddles and Pauly Polite.
[261:37.38]Right now.
[261:39.52]What's on that screen?
[261:40.52]Who is the ?
[261:43.62]It's a view.
[261:56.87]I can't wait to see this!
[261:58.29]I did it!
[261:59.17]You did it?
[261:59.91]I did it!
[262:00.67]You finished!
[262:01.39]I finished!
[262:02.45]So you've painted, who have you painted here?
[262:04.53]I have painted a very special audience member.
[262:08.29]Okay, so you've got a special audience member.
[262:10.61]I do, I found one.
[262:12.37]You got one?
[262:12.87]I did.
[262:13.63]Okay, well why don't we show, there's a special audience member here that we're going to be showing.
[262:17.81]Let's see who it is!
[262:19.23]Are you ready?
[262:20.79]Who did you paint?
[262:22.45]Here we go.
[262:24.41]Here it is.
[262:26.23]And there he is.
[262:27.78]That's you.
[262:28.42]Wow.
[262:29.44]She got you.
[262:30.80]That's you.
[262:31.44]Wow.
[262:31.52]Is that me?
[262:33.78]That's you.
[262:34.26]No, I think that might be me.
[262:36.94]Is that me?
[262:38.18]Is that you?
[262:39.18]No, that's you.
[262:39.80]That's you.
[262:40.34]That's you.
[262:41.20]Wow.
[262:42.46]Unbelievable.
[262:45.58]That looks just like you.
[262:46.76]It does.
[262:47.10]I bet it looks like you too.
[262:48.65]Yeah, it really does.
[262:49.53]It looks just like you.
[262:51.65]Well, thank you so much to Cuddles and Polypolite for their wonderful job and a great painting, too.
[262:59.20]Watch out.
[262:59.60]She's going to steal my socks.
[263:01.66]She's going to steal my socks.
[263:02.68]No, these are mine.
[263:03.46]These are mine.
[263:04.52]These are mine.
[263:05.88]These are my socks.
[263:07.16]OK.
[263:07.80]See you later, alligator.
[263:09.28]Bye.
[263:09.80]So what we're going to do now
[263:12.92]is we're gonna do something, that was a pretty good caricature of you, I think so, of me, and there's like a dollar bill going down my underwear right now.
[263:22.52]There's a dollar bill going down my underwear at the moment, and it's currently causing me some discomfort, so I'm gonna go ahead and try to fix that while we move on.
[263:34.75]What we're gonna do now, we're gonna go back to the fan favorite machine,
[263:39.96]Because I know a lot of you are probably saying, Jeremy.
[263:41.76]Yeah, Jeremy.
[263:42.34]Jeremy sucks.
[263:43.18]And I know.
[263:44.16]It's fine.
[263:44.48]But what we're going to do is we're going to do one more segment with the dunk tank.
[263:50.20]Because I know a lot of you wanted to see that again and try to dunk me again.
[263:54.60]So that is what we're going to do when we come back from potentially a few minute break.
[264:00.23]We're going to come back, and we're going to do the dunk tank one more time.
[264:04.77]So if we will cut to a Be Right Back screen.
[264:09.46]We'll be back in just a moment for one more dunk tank extraordinaire.
[264:36.16]Thank you.
[265:05.81]so
[265:45.67]Amen.
[266:29.26]Back where we were a couple hours ago.
[266:32.84]This is the main event, so I figured we'd do it for a little bit longer.
[266:38.69]Try to dunk me.
[266:39.95]We're going to do this until we break the machine.
[266:42.31]So what I think I would like to do is if the folks over at Andy Mark, the supplier of the robots, they did.
[266:49.84]First of all, let me just say they did a fantastic, a fantastic fucking job this whole day with the robots and everything.
[266:57.74]It's been it's been an absolute delight.
[267:00.88]Incredibly talented, fucking awesome people there.
[267:04.36]We're going to try to break this bot.
[267:06.36]So if you could, whoever is in control, drop the slow mode to zero.
[267:12.08]Let's try to break this fucking thing.
[267:13.29]Let's make it happen.
[267:14.53]Drop the slow mode to zero.
[267:15.83]Let's try to kill this bot and try to drop me down.
[267:21.77]If you could.
[267:23.43]Let's see what we can do with one more dunk tank appearance.
[267:27.92]I'm ready.
[267:30.14]I don't know if this is a test or not, but we're going to find out.
[267:36.14]Get rid of slow mode.
[267:37.40]It's been on five, 10 seconds the whole night.
[267:40.36]Get rid of it.
[267:45.23]It's like, holy shit.
[267:54.55]That's not gonna do anything.
[267:55.77]You're gonna send it to space.
[267:58.80]Seven seconds, come on.
[268:04.69]There it goes.
[268:05.63]See you later.
[268:06.27]Come on.
[268:09.89]Where is it?
[268:11.61]Where are you going?
[268:12.31]I think they broke it.
[268:17.33]All it took was one time.
[268:21.31]It's still going.
[268:22.13]Alright, this is freaking me out.
[268:24.35]I'm kind of scared of this.
[268:30.45]Too much.
[268:33.39]Okay, you broke it.
[268:34.52]You already broke it.
[268:36.44]So we're going to go back to the 5 to 10 second slow mode because you've already broke it.
[268:42.18]This thing is seeing so much.
[268:43.76]It's been run through the ringer so many times.
[268:46.78]I can't believe it still works.
[268:49.22]That just shows how well made this thing is.
[268:52.06]It's taking thousands of commands at the same time.
[268:54.54]So you broke it.
[268:56.41]So congratulations.
[268:57.55]You didn't even fire it.
[269:00.03]So we're going to go back to the way it was.
[269:02.36]Dunk me.
[269:03.36]Let's do it.
[269:06.74]I have no monitor, so I don't know what's happening.
[269:11.98]Why are my nails painted?
[269:13.92]Oh, that's paint.
[269:15.02]You know what I mean.
[269:15.70]It's paint from earlier.
[269:17.54]Did you piss in this?
[269:19.02]Remember I made that joke like three hours ago?
[269:20.73]Yeah, you did.
[269:28.15]Dunk me.
[269:28.55]Let's go.
[269:35.52]Uh-oh, that's close, close, close.
[269:37.36]A little more to the left.
[269:38.36]Pull it in.
[269:44.09]Oh, Jesus.
[269:46.47]Oh, God.
[269:47.59]You might as well.
[269:52.55]They're all the toys.
[269:55.21]Everything you guys collected is right here.
[269:58.01]So remember, if you dunk me, you dunk the goats.
[270:02.47]And the Fortnite Garfield.
[270:04.67]And the zebra.
[270:07.17]And the... I don't know.
[270:11.99]Wait a minute.
[270:13.37]I can feel this and I gotta figure it out.
[270:20.65]There's two scents in my underwear.
[270:26.01]Hold on, hold on.
[270:26.57]There's money in my pants.
[270:29.09]I have like... That's a dollar.
[270:32.31]That's one dollar.
[270:34.79]I feel like incredible.
[270:37.42]One dollar.
[270:43.92]If you dunk me, you get rid of all the goats too.
[270:51.74]I'm scared.
[270:53.60]I'm scared.
[270:54.20]I think I've removed all the money from my underwear.
[270:58.23]Have I?
[270:59.67]I think there's one more.
[271:01.75]You know when you go to the beach and you just feel the sand just all over you?
[271:05.29]There's like one cent bit donations all over my underwear right now.
[271:10.20]I think I'm alright.
[271:11.78]We lost somebody though.
[271:16.74]Did it die?
[271:17.30]It killed it.
[271:23.91]For every minute that it's not ready, another goat Garfield goes in the fucking tank.
[271:31.73]There one goes.
[271:33.17]No, I want that in my office.
[271:44.17]Why is it not coming towards me?
[271:47.97]Get the fuck over here.
[271:51.30]These are actually pretty nice.
[271:52.74]These are nice.
[271:58.82]He's in there.
[271:59.38]He's just in there.
[272:00.49]I can't get him out.
[272:03.77]There goes another one.
[272:05.13]No, I want to save these.
[272:06.27]I don't want them.
[272:08.63]I'm going to save Fortnite Garfield.
[272:10.09]That's the most important one.
[272:17.35]Alright.
