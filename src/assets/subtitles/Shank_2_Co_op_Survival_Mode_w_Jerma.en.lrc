[00:05.38]Hello, dissenters!
[00:07.48]My name is Etalyx, and I am here today playing Shank 2 on PC in online co-op.
[00:13.17]Yes, this game just released yesterday, and it is available on both consoles and PC.
[00:18.33]So I decided to give the online multiplayer a go in their game mode called Survival, a two-player co-op mode, and you're gonna see me playing with my friend Jerma.
[00:27.59]Now, what you need to know about Jerma is that he is a cool dude, but more than that, he has a YouTube channel, and it requires your attention.
[00:35.04]So if you would kindly follow the link in the annotation of this video, if you have annotations turned off, there is a link in the description of this video.
[00:41.62]Go check out his channel and tell him that I said hello.
[00:44.90]Also, subscribe if you like what you see.
[00:46.91]So without further ado, I hope you enjoy the video.
[00:51.86]Yeah, so I guess for those of you that don't know what is going on right now, this is not Super Smash Bros.
[00:56.74]Brawl.
[00:57.60]This is... Doesn't it look like it?
[01:00.88]It kind of looks like Smash Bros.
[01:03.20]I got smashed with a boat.
[01:05.70]Yeah, we're on the boat.
[01:06.36]But this is the multiplayer.
[01:08.88]And the multiplayer is you have to defend waves and waves.
[01:11.96]You have to defend against waves and waves of people.
[01:14.80]And I'm assuming it's going to get increasingly difficult.
[01:17.36]So, well, we shall see where this goes.
[01:21.44]We gotta defend these, yeah, these bombs here on the bottom.
[01:24.46]There's one up top too.
[01:25.62]I kinda like this one with Ermin.
[01:29.24]I'm like shooting up into the air.
[01:31.23]I'm like celebrating, I'm just like, yeah!
[01:35.65]Don't worry, I got this like, thing.
[01:38.35]It didn't even matter.
[01:39.15]I'm doing the jump.
[01:41.99]No, no, get off this bomb!
[01:44.93]Uh-oh.
[01:45.47]Oh, he threw me off the boat.
[01:46.67]Oh, my God.
[01:47.15]Are you dead?
[01:47.85]No, I'm still alive.
[01:48.83]Barely.
[01:49.15]Oh, my God.
[01:49.69]I am going to die.
[01:50.91]I'm staying back in my range.
[01:53.06]I'm dead.
[01:53.50]I'm dead.
[01:54.62]I'm okay.
[01:55.00]I'm alright.
[01:55.32]I'm good.
[01:55.90]I'll revive you.
[01:57.54]I got to use some skills here.
[02:00.52]Come on.
[02:00.98]Come on.
[02:01.76]Nice.
[02:03.00]Got it.
[02:03.36]We got it.
[02:03.80]Oh, I'm down now.
[02:05.11]I'm down.
[02:07.89]Get rid of that big hunk.
[02:10.33]Got him.
[02:10.93]Alright.
[02:11.53]That thing's going down.
[02:14.94]We got this.
[02:15.64]We can still save it.
[02:17.42]No, no!
[02:18.64]Come on!
[02:19.18]The longer you hold the revive down, the more health you come back with.
[02:22.68]Really?
[02:23.16]Yeah, I think so.
[02:24.36]Because you're like half health.
[02:26.87]Oh, there's a guy down there.
[02:28.37]He's being sneaky.
[02:30.03]You need to get some health.
[02:31.03]Take some tequila.
[02:32.05]It's good for your bones.
[02:33.03]Alright, disarming this bomb.
[02:35.19]About to...
[02:36.50]buy something from the shop.
[02:37.60]What is the hog?
[02:39.22]I don't know.
[02:39.84]War boar.
[02:40.64]A trained boar that will defend supplies.
[02:43.41]Really?
[02:46.63]I got some health.
[02:47.67]I managed to buy some health.
[02:49.19]We've got one of those explosive boxes up there.
[02:52.51]I think they're just item crates, to be honest.
[02:55.07]Oh, jeez.
[02:55.81]Did you just do that?
[03:00.04]I thought those guys could activate it, but I think you just dropped it on my head.
[03:05.62]It's getting close.
[03:06.52]It's getting a little dangerous down here.
[03:08.00]Yeah, it totally is getting dangerous.
[03:11.42]Oh no!
[03:12.12]I just did the same thing to you!
[03:17.28]Oh, you know what?
[03:17.64]You know what?
[03:18.58]I gotta buy some tequila.
[03:20.56]I'm full health, I'm good.
[03:21.24]You can do that in the middle of a match.
[03:22.76]Oh, awesome.
[03:23.62]Okay.
[03:25.14]You're not going to call it a boar, are you?
[03:27.80]I really want to.
[03:28.49]I have enough money.
[03:29.35]I'm going to do it.
[03:30.39]Here we go.
[03:30.65]Alright, let's see what it does.
[03:32.13]Battle boar.
[03:33.19]That is battle boar right there.
[03:34.65]He's defending this crate.
[03:36.31]Oh, that wasn't a total waste of money.
[03:37.89]Oh, no.
[03:38.35]Oh, there he goes.
[03:40.26]Just sit back here and unload.
[03:42.82]Oh, look at that.
[03:43.52]It's going to be sad when he dies.
[03:45.56]I think he just died.
[03:46.78]Oh, my God.
[03:47.66]I'm going to get back broken.
[03:51.15]Whoa.
[03:51.75]He's going to shoot in the air.
[03:53.35]We almost got him.
[03:54.08]We almost got him.
[03:54.72]Yes.
[03:55.54]Sweet.
[03:55.82]Alright.
[03:56.40]Buy some tequila.
[03:57.22]Buy some tequila.
[03:58.60]Oh, I'm just jumping and dodging all over the place.
[04:01.38]There's tequila lying right here.
[04:02.98]You can get up here and drink that tequila.
[04:05.34]Drink it.
[04:06.58]Yes.
[04:07.34]Yes.
[04:08.16]Oh, no.
[04:12.35]This is it.
[04:14.13]Shock him.
[04:15.17]Oh, he didn't go off.
[04:15.69]How did that not revive you?
[04:16.97]That's ridiculous.
[04:19.05]Oh, I think this might be a good game right here.
[04:22.37]I am just like rolling around.
[04:24.37]You can pull off some nasty moves here.
[04:27.17]There's no way, there's no way.
[04:29.13]Yeah, this is a good game.
[04:32.07]All caches exploded.
[04:33.75]Alright, well, we made it to wave seven, which is pretty pro.
[04:40.33]Winner by 1500 points.
[04:43.12]Wait, I won?
[04:44.76]What do you mean I won?
[04:45.64]You got more bombers killed and you apparently got credit for killing the boss.
[04:50.32]Oh, I didn't know if it was a direct competition.
[04:52.06]We're supposed to be working together.
[04:55.23]I think Battle Boar should have counted in that.
[04:57.45]I think I don't get credit for that.
[04:59.01]Yeah, the Battle Boar was definitely where it came from.
[05:01.79]That would have thrown me over the edge, probably.
[05:04.01]I think you're right, except I am already low on health.
[05:08.26]Yeah, I'm going to buy it just because I want full health.
[05:13.43]I accidentally bought Battle Boar.
[05:17.43]My bad.
[05:18.60]My bad.
[05:20.60]He is protecting that middle ground.
[05:22.16]Look at that.
[05:22.82]Look at him protecting it.
[05:25.71]Activate the fire.
[05:26.69]Step into that.
[05:27.23]Almost.
[05:27.67]You almost got him.
[05:33.06]I am down.
[05:33.66]That was really stupid.
[05:35.14]It's alright.
[05:35.50]It's alright.
[05:35.84]We're good.
[05:36.48]You know why?
[05:36.92]Because Battle Boar.
[05:38.06]Oh, shit.
[05:38.96]You hit Battle Boar, too.
[05:40.58]Well, my play did not work.
[05:42.96]Wait.
[05:43.44]Fire.
[05:44.44]Oh, lady.
[05:45.10]That's how you do it.
[05:45.96]Jump down.
[05:46.42]Jump down quickly.
[05:47.62]He's dead.
[05:48.16]I just jumped on top of you.
[05:50.36]He is dead.
[05:51.54]Wait.
[05:51.70]He's dead?
[05:52.10]You killed him with a fire.
[05:55.73]I don't deserve that money.
[05:58.08]You got me up for about five seconds.
[06:01.46]They're fighting Battle Boar down there.
[06:03.10]Good, good.
[06:03.64]Battle Boar is doing his thing.
[06:05.42]I am going to hold on.
[06:07.74]Mini gun.
[06:08.30]I'm buying it.
[06:09.64]You better pick it up.
[06:10.98]I just picked it up and put it down.
[06:12.48]Revive, revive.
[06:14.66]That's too risky.
[06:17.40]I'm just dead down here, man.
[06:20.17]They've planted on both.
[06:21.13]I'll get the bottom one.
[06:22.41]I'll get the top one.
[06:25.25]No, jump up there.
[06:26.01]What am I doing?
[06:27.61]I got it.
[06:27.93]Alright, alright.
[06:28.71]Defusing.
[06:29.67]Yep, I got it.
[06:30.21]Got it.
[06:31.77]Mini gun.
[06:33.21]Get over that ladder, sir.
[06:36.55]Wow, that is pretty epic.
[06:38.52]Oh, this thing is totally worth it.
[06:40.92]Totally worth it.
[06:41.68]Alright, I'll disarm it.
[06:43.90]I'll disarm it.
[06:44.30]No, no, no.
[06:44.94]Oh, God.
[06:45.44]Okay, okay.
[06:46.34]We gotta distract him.
[06:47.20]I'm gonna lead him up.
[06:48.24]This thing's gonna go.
[06:49.18]It's gonna blow.
[06:49.78]Oh, this thing's gonna blow.
[06:51.54]I'm dead.
[06:53.11]I just barely got away.
[06:54.09]We have to get rid of one of these.
[06:55.17]I got this one.
[06:55.69]Alright, we got that one.
[06:57.89]We've only got one left.
[06:59.13]We've only got one left.
[06:59.76]Just barely.
[07:00.32]Barely got that off.
[07:03.62]Oh, jeez.
[07:06.32]Oh, I'm dead.
[07:07.14]Oh, no, no, no.
[07:08.14]I'm dead.
[07:08.62]Oh, no, no, no.
[07:10.76]Tequila man.
[07:11.58]Tequila.
[07:12.66]I already drank it.
[07:13.30]I already did it.
[07:14.02]Oh, no.
[07:14.50]Oh, God.
[07:15.64]Look out.
[07:16.32]You're still alive.
[07:17.32]You're still alive.
[07:18.78]Oh, wow.
[07:19.12]He is fast.
[07:20.84]Why is he so fast?
[07:21.74]This is ridiculous.
[07:24.94]Okay, you got it.
[07:26.24]Hold on, I gotta do this.
[07:28.44]Oh my god, he's jumping up here.
[07:29.98]I can't believe I just got that.
[07:31.90]I can't believe I just got that off.
[07:34.14]Yeah, turn on the... Oh, no.
[07:35.66]Good, good, good.
[07:37.56]This could be it.
[07:39.83]Oh, yeah.
[07:41.15]Oh, yeah.
[07:41.89]That's what I'm talking about.
[07:43.37]I can't... I'm staying in range.
[07:44.83]I'm not gonna go in front of any... Ow, ow, ow.
[07:47.79]Fire.
[07:48.79]Did I... Okay, you can't... We killed him.
[07:50.85]We got him.
[07:51.23]We got him.
[07:51.61]Done.
[07:52.95]Yep.
[07:53.53]So...
[07:54.75]I think I'm going to bake a turret, man.
[07:56.61]Man, I am just basically just buying tequila at every opportunity.
[08:00.29]I know, me too.
[08:01.77]Buy a turret, quick.
[08:02.85]You've got no time.
[08:04.17]Heavy attacks.
[08:05.77]Heavy attacks, man.
[08:06.51]$2,000.
[08:07.69]I don't got that kind of cash.
[08:12.63]Oh, they've got riot shields.
[08:13.95]What is this?
[08:15.19]What is this, Call of Duty?
[08:16.11]Uh-oh.
[08:17.41]They've got a Call of Duty riot shield.
[08:20.61]Oh, God.
[08:20.93]Is he planting?
[08:21.55]He planted.
[08:22.39]I can't get up there.
[08:23.49]Here we go.
[08:23.79]No.
[08:25.45]Alright, I'm defusing.
[08:27.54]Oh god!
[08:28.26]Oh no!
[08:29.60]This could be the end.
[08:31.28]I'm just throwing grenades.
[08:32.12]I don't even know where they're going.
[08:33.94]I'm down.
[08:35.18]No!
[08:35.78]No!
[08:36.20]Defuse it!
[08:36.64]I got you.
[08:37.04]I got you back.
[08:37.46]I got it.
[08:38.01]I got it.
[08:38.33]Nice.
[08:38.67]That was clutch.
[08:40.65]We're about dead.
[08:41.13]We're about dead.
[08:42.11]Oh yeah?
[08:42.59]Turret!
[08:43.39]I just built it.
[08:44.87]I'm dead.
[08:45.69]What is it doing?
[08:47.87]The turret's not doing anything.
[08:48.95]There it goes.
[08:49.30]It's like a team.
[08:49.92]Oh, there we go.
[08:50.38]There we go.
[08:50.78]Okay.
[08:52.10]I need to revive down here.
[08:55.63]I can't even get down there.
[08:57.87]They're like throwing grenades.
[08:58.65]Oh, my God.
[08:58.89]I just jumped in.
[08:59.79]I'm so confused right now.
[09:01.55]You still got this.
[09:02.91]Nope.
[09:03.59]I'm dead.
[09:04.31]We are dead.
[09:05.30]We just lost it.
[09:05.92]That was way 15.
[09:07.42]Way 15.
[09:08.76]That was pretty good.
[09:09.60]That was pretty solid right there.
[09:12.32]Man, that's embarrassing.
[09:16.71]Money earned, 10,000 to 4,000.
[09:19.59]I got seven disarms, though, so I'll take that.
[09:21.81]Hey, I do have the controller, though.
[09:23.95]Let's be fair.
[09:24.99]You do, you do.
[09:26.41]I think you're just running over all the money.
[09:28.27]I think that's where all your points are coming from.
[09:30.25]I must be like the money bastard that just runs over things.
[09:36.38]I'm pretty happy.
[09:37.58]I'm playing defensively right there.
[09:38.98]You see that 25 bombers killed, seven bombs disarmed?
[09:42.74]Playing defensively.
