[00:01.69]Hello again.
[00:04.99]How are you?
[00:08.91]I'm back.
[00:10.98]Those of you that were here last night, sorry for the abrupt ending.
[00:16.58]Don't know what happened, but they were either doing maintenance or there was some kind of accident or something.
[00:22.29]Maybe, potentially, we don't really know.
[00:24.87]But, internet abruptly just turned off to the whole house.
[00:29.78]And didn't come back.
[00:31.53]Came back for like 30 minutes, and then went down again.
[00:36.21]So, sorry about that.
[00:38.87]But we're back now.
[00:40.45]Everything seems to be back in working order.
[00:45.54]I hope you're having a good day, so far.
[00:48.90]I'm having a good day.
[00:50.54]I'm going to do something today that I said I was going to do a year and a half ago.
[00:58.40]Just over a full year ago, I said I was gonna do this.
[01:02.63]We played Stuntman Ignition on a PS2 night.
[01:08.56]Remember that?
[01:08.96]Remember when I did all those PS2 games in a row?
[01:12.60]Well, Stuntman Ignition was one of them.
[01:14.92]And it turns out, the game looks like shit, and is almost unbearable to play and look at on PS2.
[01:22.33]So I said, Wait, there's a PS3 version, everyone was saying.
[01:25.41]There's a PS3, it's way better, so much better graphics, better handling of the cars.
[01:29.45]So I said, alright.
[01:33.82]I'll get the PS3 version.
[01:36.93]I said I was gonna do that, like, probably in a few weeks.
[01:39.49]It's been more than a year.
[01:40.85]So, Stuntman Ignition PS3 version tonight.
[01:45.32]Been sitting on it for a while.
[01:48.30]Here we go!
[01:50.48]Don't know how long we're gonna play this for, but I figured I would do it because it's here and I'm gonna do it.
[01:56.53]If this takes less than a couple hours...
[02:00.31]Because DOS got disconnected.
[02:02.19]We had disconnected DOS last night.
[02:05.03]I will just go back and we will do more of that.
[02:08.13]I might get addicted to this and I might want to play this all night.
[02:10.93]I don't know.
[02:12.99]I can't tell you.
[02:15.71]So if we go more than 4, 5, 6, 7 hours on Stuntman Ignition, which is possible.
[02:20.93]I can't predict the future.
[02:27.86]We'll see.
[02:29.59]But, we're here.
[02:32.27]And I have to do some tests with you guys.
[02:37.29]Because it's been a long time since I've connected the original Elgato HD to this computer.
[02:45.91]So, we're going to see how out of sync this is.
[02:51.67]You ready?
[02:53.99]There it is.
[02:56.27]So, if you could do me a huge favor, and let me know when you hear the sounds.
[03:02.65]Well, I mean, you can hear the music, but ready?
[03:04.09]So, like, for instance... Let me, like, turn the music off.
[03:13.10]Okay.
[03:14.14]So, you guys hear that, right?
[03:15.24]That, like... Let me ask you a question.
[03:19.66]Ready?
[03:21.88]Ding!
[03:22.40]Don't!
[03:22.92]Ding!
[03:23.18]Don't!
[03:23.40]Ding!
[03:25.90]How bad is that?
[03:31.18]Are we in sync?
[03:32.90]It's fine, is it?
[03:34.77]No way.
[03:39.09]I know I'm louder, but I mean, I can change that.
[03:41.09]Okay, so for instance, ready?
[03:43.57]It's in sync?
[03:49.55]I can't even believe it.
[04:00.31]okay it's a little off but it's a little late this this sound is a little late tell me to check this out let me know about one two three four one two three four yes no no no no no
[04:24.18]No, no, no, no, no.
[04:25.70]What was that?
[04:26.47]Perfect.
[04:27.49]Worse.
[04:29.49]Hey, that's perfect.
[04:31.09]It's way worse.
[04:32.91]The duality.
[04:35.99]Now it's worse.
[04:36.87]What about, hold on.
[04:38.37]Let me try one more thing.
[04:39.81]Just doing a little bit of experimentation here.
[04:46.82]1 2 3 4 ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding... 1 2 3 4.
[04:58.00]Now it's worse.
[05:04.24]It was better the first time. Okay, hold on.
[05:10.24]Hey, welcome to Jerma985.
[05:14.24]I need to- let me see, can I hear this?
[05:19.24]One.
[05:20.16]Two.
[05:21.24]One.
[05:22.14]Duh.
[05:23.12]Duh.
[05:24.11]Duh.
[05:25.15]Duh.
[05:26.13]Duh.
[05:26.27]Duh.
[05:27.09]Duh.
[05:28.09]Duh.
[05:29.07]Duh.
[05:31.33]Alright.
[05:35.70]Yo, now my voice is late.
[05:39.06]It's good.
[05:39.68]Alright, can I mod tell me if this is good?
[05:51.08]Okay, I'm just gonna play.
[05:53.96]No, that's way too loud.
[05:54.98]Ahmad has spoken.
[06:01.88]That's fine.
[06:02.36]Alright, we're good!
[06:06.43]Welcome to Stuntman Ignition!
[06:11.51]Last time we started the first, uh, little bit of the career, we're just gonna do it.
[06:15.29]Remember this part?
[06:16.51]I did this for like an hour.
[06:19.69]Remember we talked about how this was Vegeta?
[06:21.95]It's very blurry It's really low volume for me
[06:47.91]Why is it so low for me and not for you guys?
[06:52.27]Get out of the car!
[06:53.75]Get out of the car!
[06:55.68]You only got five seconds!
[07:04.05]It is low.
[07:04.31]Oh, fuck.
[07:04.47]I remember this.
[07:04.95]We did the first mission and then I gave up.
[07:05.97]Yeah, I'll change it.
[07:06.71]I'll make it flatter.
[07:26.80]Yeah, you gotta do what they say.
[07:28.48]You gotta land it, stick it.
[07:30.00]I remember this shit.
[07:30.92]It's deja vu.
[07:31.42]Yeah, it's gonna be deja vu for the first, like, 20 to 30 minutes.
[07:46.79]More precisely you perform, more points you'll earn.
[07:49.78]Fail a director stunt, and you'll get a strike.
[07:52.26]Five strikes, and Richard will have to go to reshoot, which won't make him happy.
[07:56.36]Once you finish a run successfully, he'll look at the points... I'm getting motion sickness.
[08:00.88]Why is the cameraman doing this?
[08:02.94]Richard's been doing this a long time, and he's well-respected.
[08:06.39]You could get all this from just having a wide.
[08:09.41]You don't have to zoom in on everything.
[08:10.95]Still on with the studio.
[08:12.37]Look, it was nice to meet you.
[08:13.57]I'll see you on the set.
[08:18.06]Alright, kid, let's get you prepped for your work on this.
[08:20.08]Oh, shit, I gotta zoom in and go out of focus.
[08:22.62]You'll drive four different vehicles on Aftershock.
[08:25.81]An RC-1000 sports coupe, an older SUV, a dirt bike, and a fire chief's patrol car.
[08:31.27]Each handles differently.
[08:32.17]He's too close.
[08:32.89]Pull back, man.
[08:34.25]So just relax.
[08:35.59]These sets are big and chaotic with live explosions, projectiles... This cameraman went to the school of 20-year-old YouTubers.
[08:42.58]...or the whole production will have to stop while the crew pulls you out.
[08:45.46]We've got some great stunts planned.
[08:47.18]There's a high-risk sequence racing over burning rooftops, and a huge finale where the town gets ripped apart.
[08:53.21]Before each scene, I'll give you shots of your key stunts with tips on how to pull them off.
[08:56.83]So, just listen to me, and you'll get through this in one piece.
[08:59.35]Alright, I'm good.
[09:01.47]And now it's fucking loud.
[09:03.65]Now it's loud again.
[09:05.45]That's just how it works.
[09:06.61]Remember, every cutscene is its own full-motion video, rendered video, that they put at a certain level.
[09:15.56]Okay.
[09:16.23]All I can do is the Reign of Terror.
[09:22.54]It's gonna be right for the first scene you'll double for the town's troublemaking drifter in his r3000 as he flees the volcanic eruption The highlight will be this huge jump over a burning semi.
[09:32.97]The key is to hit the ramp straight That'll set you up for the stunt that follows Yeah, as soon as you land you'll have a pair of precision drivers coming at you fast and you'll need to gap between them It's dangerous.
[09:43.25]So be careful and don't be afraid of retakes.
[09:45.86]Mr Langston's a picky director and it can take a while to make him happy
[09:52.64]Let's focus and start the film right.
[09:54.80]Over the jump, through the middle.
[09:57.48]Here we go.
[09:57.86]Three, two, one, action.
[10:01.35]Action.
[10:03.07]Gap the cars.
[10:10.43]Oh my god.
[10:12.25]I just, I murdered that person.
[10:15.21]What's handbrake?
[10:16.80]Over the dagger.
[10:23.36]Hold on, hold on.
[10:24.28]I need to see the controls.
[10:29.08]Handbrake is O.
[10:50.31]Gas, brake, steering, right.
[10:52.25]Action is triangle.
[10:53.25]Okay.
[10:54.25]Got it.
[10:54.77]It's circle.
[10:56.51]Uh, Jerma sucks thanks to the five community subs.
[11:00.61]Circle is handbrake.
[11:01.53]I'm ready.
[11:02.99]Three, two, one, action!
[11:05.93]Cap the cars.
[11:09.31]Cap the cars.
[11:13.89]Nice.
[11:15.37]Drift turn right!
[11:19.94]Perfect.
[11:20.40]Over the tanker.
[11:21.40]Tanker, drift turn left.
[11:22.70]Gap the cars.
[11:24.76]Ooh.
[11:24.84]What?
[11:25.12]I went through it.
[11:27.30]Drift turn left.
[11:28.20]Pass close to the car.
[11:33.92]How do I get through that?
[11:37.30]Under the tree.
[11:39.88]Close to the car.
[11:40.58]Can you seriously imagine him having a fucking stuntman?
[11:43.68]Through the gap.
[11:45.76]You're telling him what to do as he's doing it.
[11:48.42]Let's move on to the next shot.
[11:50.02]Oh, hey, you're gonna have to go... Come over here, man.
[11:52.02]Let me talk to you for a minute.
[11:53.08]Yeah, yeah, hey, I'm new.
[11:54.96]I'm the new stunt driver.
[11:56.03]Yeah, come here.
[11:57.25]We need to go through the gap in the cars here.
[11:59.83]Go through that, and it's gonna be the take.
[12:01.31]And then when he gets in the car, you fucking, like, strap him in.
[12:05.03]Lock him in the front seat.
[12:09.22]Drift turn right!
[12:09.92]Guy's, like, fucking screaming.
[12:11.58]You have him, like, locked in, like, straight jacked and stuff.
[12:18.68]Screaming me commands, and you never told me any of this shit before.
[12:24.89]Oh, you guys can't hear me?
[12:27.29]You can't hear what I'm saying?
[12:29.25]Fuck.
[12:32.85]Let's watch the replay!
[12:42.74]Ooh, almost got by that guy.
[12:48.97]Nice.
[12:52.43]He's just like a guy in a mustard dress shirt.
[13:10.26]No, I kind of just said fuck that one.
[13:12.10]I'm not doing that one.
[13:16.64]Alright, let's keep going.
[13:18.04]New scene.
[13:22.07]This next scene is Lava Flow.
[13:24.81]Lava Flow.
[13:27.39]This is just GTA V with a cinematic camera.
[13:30.73]That's just a regular day in GTA V. If you perform a stunt within two seconds of another stunt, that will continue your stunt string and add another number to your multiplier.
[13:44.80]Now you're stunt stringing.
[13:47.02]Be sure to watch your stunt indicator on the upper left.
[13:49.98]It tells you what stunt you just performed and how long you have until your string breaks.
[13:54.56]That looks hard to do.
[13:55.28]Uh-huh.
[13:55.44]String them.
[13:55.72]Fifth star.
[14:19.01]That means keep a continuous string from your first stunt to your last.
[14:22.11]I'm never going to get five stars, guaranteed.
[14:23.48]Your total score should read zero.
[14:26.52]What?
[14:26.82]Wait, hold on.
[14:29.98]My total score should be zero.
[14:31.90]Is he just making fun of me?
[14:37.87]I feel like he was just talking shit.
[14:43.56]Okay, string the scene.
[14:44.70]Let's go.
[14:50.65]I gotta, I gotta hold on a minute here.
[14:53.11]Is there a way that I can make this so the audio, the, the... It's gotta, we gotta keep it all the same level.
[14:59.19]Menu volume is gonna be the, let's just do like this.
[15:02.69]Everything at 60.
[15:04.59]Car volume 6, right?
[15:06.03]Like, then everything would be the same and I can adjust it perfectly.
[15:08.37]You know what I'm sayin'?
[15:11.40]It's the menu volume that's fucking it all up.
[15:13.24]I think that's gonna be good.
[15:13.90]Let's go.
[15:15.28]We alright?
[15:16.40]I think so.
[15:27.62]String it.
[15:30.20]Pretty good.
[15:34.34]What's next?
[15:37.07]Too early.
[15:41.28]Got it.
[15:42.00]That's not bad.
[15:42.52]That's not bad.
[15:42.92]It's going to be four stars.
[15:43.62]Five stars.
[15:45.22]That's good.
[15:46.78]Does anybody remember when I did this the first time?
[15:49.98]I couldn't do this.
[15:53.93]I specifically have this memory of being angry at the game because I could not do this.
[15:59.75]What happened?
[16:03.59]I don't understand.
[16:04.17]What changed?
[16:06.36]Alright, today's run will be the drifter's last scene when he tries to escape the town and gets torched by a lava boulder at the end.
[16:12.70]The feature stunt is the pyro charge.
[16:14.89]As you cross over a certain lava fissure in the ground, which will mark on your HUD, trigger the charge and set your car on fire.
[16:21.63]It'll get hot, but you'll be wearing a cool suit.
[16:24.89]Once you're lit, drift hard to the right and gap through the car wash.
[16:28.31]That'll extinguish the fire.
[16:29.87]Then race on to the big finale.
[16:31.93]And remember, kid, watch out for that lava.
[16:35.65]Yeah, but the PS2 version was, like, unplayable.
[16:37.87]It was, like, 12 frames a second and at, like, 360p.
[16:41.03]What say we give the moviegoers something to scream about?
[16:43.49]Alright.
[16:47.59]String it.
[16:49.32]Here we go!
[16:49.70]Three, two, one, action!
[16:53.66]Hit the object!
[16:55.58]Cut!
[16:56.12]You have to stay out of the lava!
[17:06.75]Hit the object.
[17:07.51]Through the gap.
[17:12.85]Ow, my head.
[17:19.26]Use action.
[17:21.88]Oh, my god.
[17:26.14]That director is not going to be alive.
[17:28.44]Just turn right.
[17:31.76]Through the gap.
[17:32.92]Car wash.
[17:35.63]Oh my god.
[17:36.49]I had an instant fucking headache again.
[17:39.55]I knew it was going to take less than five minutes.
[17:44.66]God damn it.
[17:50.26]That motherfucker's dead.
[17:57.14]That motherfucker's dead.
[18:03.89]Through the burning building.
[18:08.77]It's horrible.
[18:17.88]What?
[18:18.28]Am I alive?
[18:20.18]Cut.
[18:20.76]Check the tape.
[18:21.52]There was some good vermin there.
[18:22.92]I want to see.
[18:35.45]Ignite your vehicle for the first time.
[18:38.64]hot wash and hot wax.
[18:39.78]Okay, cool.
[18:41.51]I got a color customizer.
[18:43.81]Very nice.
[18:44.37]And you unlocked the R3000.
[19:24.33]It's too loud.
[19:33.39]The camera angle's bad because I killed the director.
[19:36.21]Yeah, that's true.
[19:38.10]Oh god, my fucking stomach hurts.
[19:44.28]I did a pretty good job, but I contained myself pretty well here.
[19:56.26]Wait, what?
[19:59.84]What happened to that car?
[20:02.20]That car just flew forward.
[20:05.70]And then they just detonate me.
[20:15.06]That person's not alive.
[20:16.92]There's no way.
[20:24.11]Okay.
[20:26.05]Let's keep going.
[20:33.08]I'm really, really, I'm so glad I actually a year later decided to play this game.
[20:39.70]So this is a volcano climb.
[20:44.23]How can the game be so loud and so quiet at the same time?
[20:48.65]Thank you Klowski for the five community subs.
[20:50.91]Thank you.
[20:53.69]Five subs coming in.
[20:56.44]Alright.
[20:56.66]What are those unique ones?
[20:58.34]How do you do a wheelie?
[20:59.34]Just pull back?
[21:00.15]Yeah, alright, you just pull back.
[21:23.79]Aw, nice.
[21:24.05]That's a lot of info on the screen for just holding left.
[21:26.70]Alright, let's go.
[21:47.39]What are all the diagrams for?
[21:48.65]Yeah, I, this, somebody just had... I mean, it is like a Hollywood movie studio, so this is somebody just making slides for everything.
[21:57.68]They make slides and, like, storyboards and shit for, like, what they eat for lunch every day.
[22:02.06]Doesn't surprise me.
[22:04.20]Three, two, one, go!
[22:07.78]Pop a wheelie!
[22:23.62]Oh, it's hard to do on the bike.
[22:25.33]Ow!
[22:25.65]I didn't know there was going to be a U-turn.
[22:51.77]This is like when you're driving in the car with, like, your mother or something.
[22:54.97]And... Like, oh, can you take me to the bank?
[22:59.29]Yeah, sure, Ma.
[23:00.63]Oh, what bank do you want to go to?
[23:01.79]I know how to get there.
[23:02.71]Just listen to me.
[23:03.50]I'll tell you.
[23:03.96]What's the... Put it in the GPS.
[23:05.46]No, no, no.
[23:05.94]I don't need the GPS.
[23:07.60]I don't need that fucking stupid technology.
[23:10.66]And you get to, like, the turn that you need to go to, and they're just like, oh, yeah, like, so when I... When your grandfather and I used to... We used to smoke every day and... No, take this one!
[23:19.77]It's that one!
[23:24.16]Just tell me the address, Grandma.
[23:31.35]I can do that better.
[23:41.93]Slide under.
[23:45.25]Nice.
[23:45.68]String.
[23:50.80]String.
[23:51.42]String.
[24:05.54]What?
[24:05.84]That was a U-turn!
[24:08.50]I just did it!
[24:09.30]Huh?
[24:11.28]Alright, we're good.
[24:24.78]I got it.
[24:27.26]No!
[24:27.54]Don't play again!
[24:28.14]Next scene!
[24:41.39]That looks so goofy.
[24:47.40]U-turn!
[24:49.66]U-turn!
[24:50.14]No, you!
[24:50.80]No, you!
[24:51.22]I see what you guys are doing.
[24:59.05]There we go.
[25:09.92]I did it!
[25:13.45]Alright, just get me out of this.
[25:19.05]Oh, great.
[25:33.58]Keep it high speed when you land.
[25:35.52]Then a blast will hurl a couple of cars right at you with some serious force.
[25:39.79]Dodge under the flying cars by sliding the bike like we rehearsed.
[25:43.55]After the slide, you'll move real quick into a hard drift left, so be ready for it.
[25:49.13]After that, Grandma will tell you where to go after that.
[25:51.24]She'll tell you how to get back to Grandma's house.
[26:01.92]Wait, hold on.
[26:19.25]Hold on.
[26:20.17]Wait, wait, wait.
[26:20.87]Guys, I can push him over there.
[26:22.18]Just wait a second.
[26:22.96]This is important.
[26:25.94]I gotta be quick about it, though.
[26:44.02]Let's go get grandma.
[26:49.81]Close left.
[26:52.27]Through the gap.
[26:58.41]Alright, come on.
[26:58.87]I can hit this.
[27:05.66]Use action?
[27:07.46]Why?
[27:08.12]Why would I use action there?
[27:15.95]Come on!
[27:18.11]Alright, we got it.
[27:24.34]We got it.
[27:25.14]New color.
[27:25.36]Nice.
[27:25.46]Okay, here we go.
[27:26.22]Let's watch that movie.
[27:54.69]What?
[27:58.47]No!
[28:00.43]No!
[28:09.84]Bad editor, bad editor.
[28:17.10]That's unfortunate.
[28:20.22]Cameraman missed it.
[28:20.94]Well, to be fair, why would the cameraman be filming at the crew?
[28:24.26]There's no reason for that.
[28:25.28]That was like a Tony Hawk rhyme.
[28:30.86]That was way cooler than what they wanted me to do.
[28:32.61]Alright, let's keep going.
[28:43.91]Career meant new scene.
[28:51.22]Three, two, one.
[28:53.40]Earthshake.
[28:54.72]What?
[29:11.31]Can I have a suit of armor?
[29:12.25]I have a t-shirt on.
[29:12.81]Oh my god.
[29:13.11]Yeah, the budget doesn't call for anything besides a red t-shirt.
[29:38.43]Good luck on the 180 foot fall.
[29:40.85]Where do I go?
[29:51.34]Get up!
[29:56.44]Close to the explosion.
[30:11.52]What?
[30:11.74]Was that a jump?
[30:15.14]Alright, I got it.
[30:23.32]I thought I had to drift here.
[30:25.33]No, you see me go through.
[30:26.99]Close call.
[30:32.03]These people!
[30:32.53]Who are these other people?
[30:33.45]I would hate to be one of these other stuntmen.
[30:38.22]Alright, right through the sign, right there.
[30:44.60]Boom.
[30:45.16]Get the jump.
[30:46.32]Why am I still on my ?
[30:47.16]Hard left turn.
[30:48.04]Land in the box.
[30:56.94]I don't even know.
[30:58.00]What?
[30:59.55]Drift turn left.
[31:11.80]You... Come on.
[31:15.36]U-turn.
[31:16.38]U-turn?
[31:20.07]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[31:20.75]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[31:25.27]No!
[31:25.39]God damn it.
[31:46.66]Through the sign, right here.
[31:47.54]And then there's another, where's this other jump?
[31:54.67]Right there?
[31:57.79]Damn, that's hard.
[32:07.59]Why does it have to be real lava?
[32:10.15]You don't have to have real lava.
[32:14.76]It doesn't need to be actual magma.
[32:18.04]How would you even get that here?
[32:30.62]I gotta be going faster than this shit.
[32:38.68]Right there, got it.
[32:40.46]Alright, land.
[32:43.33]In the box.
[32:44.69]Got it.
[32:48.69]It's that frame rate, man.
[32:50.97]Come on!
[32:59.79]Action and then I have to drift.
[33:02.29]U-turn.
[33:05.15]Fuck.
[33:12.67]That was such a shitty jump.
[33:21.78]Why?
[33:22.10]Get out of my fucking way!
[33:23.30]Why would they break in front of me?
[33:27.64]Jump the shack?
[33:34.52]I did it.
[33:35.16]Okay.
[33:38.40]If it's one star, I'm going to laugh.
[33:41.36]Thank god.
[33:49.28]That's two stars.
[33:50.04]That's alright.
[33:52.62]We don't even need to see the replay on this one.
[33:55.02]We have to watch the replay on all of them.
[34:00.97]Not bad.
[34:02.51]Oh, right.
[34:03.51]That person's on fire, too.
[34:10.15]They don't even have like a head protector, mask, or anything.
[34:12.55]Just burning.
[34:20.08]Ooh, that was pretty tricky.
[34:23.18]That was weird, too.
[34:24.28]Why did that speed up?
[34:26.43]Is this going like three times speed?
[34:28.23]What's going on here?
[34:32.57]It's playing this EDF music.
[34:34.17]I could use a little work.
[34:47.97]What did I do wrong here?
[35:07.72]This game is fucking ridiculous.
[35:09.44]I love it.
[35:10.88]We're almost done with the first set of scenes here.
[35:16.40]This is first tremor in the movie Aftershock.
[35:20.91]In this scene, you're stunting for a volcanologist, racing down the mountain to warn the authorities that this eruption is gonna cause even more damage than everyone thinks.
[35:29.17]For the big stunt, you'll off-road to a ramp on a hill, take a long jump over a chasm, crash through the support beams, and land on the bridge.
[35:37.50]Oh, God.
[35:37.96]Gonna have to do this a few times, I think.
[35:39.44]I'll do my best.
[35:39.88]Keep up the speed.
[36:06.49]Like... I... You didn't tell me that was... What the fuck?
[36:19.11]Got it.
[36:20.45]Not bad.
[36:21.88]What?
[36:24.50]Oh!
[36:28.16]Through the gap?
[36:28.86]I don't know what to do!
[36:32.08]I don't know what else to do.
[36:32.76]I don't know what...
[36:42.47]Just kind of like go fucking backwards.
[36:48.23]Go backwards over it.
[36:50.96]String it.
[36:53.28]I went through it.
[37:12.16]I did it!
[37:25.60]Land in the box.
[37:35.18]Nooo, please!
[37:36.86]Oh, goddammit!
[37:50.73]I'm sorry.
[37:53.61]I'm sorry.
[38:05.04]Take him out.
[38:08.42]He's taking me out.
[38:12.58]I got a minute.
[38:13.53]I'm good.
[38:14.03]No more mistakes.
[38:20.29]Come on.
[38:20.85]Oh, the X's.
[38:21.69]X, X, X, X, X, X. I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[38:24.95]Forgot.
[38:25.65]Forgot that to happen in the beginning.
[38:30.13]No X.
[38:52.54]How is that not through the burning house?
[38:55.20]I don't... What happened?
[38:56.62]Why is that not through the burning house?
[39:01.28]Restart it.
[39:21.56]This car sucks.
[39:23.92]Give me my motorcycle.
[39:39.49]Turn left.
[39:41.25]Downhill.
[39:42.96]Through the burning building.
[39:44.08]Hard right.
[39:50.26]Through the gap.
[39:53.03]He's doing it.
[39:59.39]Through the trees.
[40:05.88]In the box.
[40:08.26]Oh!
[40:11.74]Come on, something.
[40:22.05]I love keep up the speed, but it's impossible.
[40:25.31]There's so many turns.
[40:30.03]Alright, crush through.
[40:39.13]We're good.
[40:47.74]Next time.
[40:48.12]What is it?
[40:49.92]Tell me.
[40:56.30]Oh no, am I gonna fake it?
[41:06.07]I got it.
[41:09.67]What?
[41:10.39]There's more?
[41:12.29]What?
[41:14.09]What does it want me to do?
[41:30.80]He was sitting right here.
[41:34.38]Why would you be 10 feet in front of where the guy lands from a huge jump?
[41:45.67]You set the camera up and get out of the way, man.
[41:53.41]Let's take a look.
[41:54.91]Finished product.
[42:03.77]I'm always in the same clothes, too.
[42:09.01]Nailed it.
[42:18.54]GTA V. It's funny because this is playing GTA V online in cinematic mode.
[42:29.19]There'll be helicopters flying around, dropping missiles, people driving around.
[42:32.84]This actually is what this is like online.
[42:37.12]Cars that have just recently exploded on every single street.
[42:57.23]Not even a helmet on me either.
[43:01.29]This is a long scene.
[43:06.62]I messed that up somehow.
[43:14.53]All the doors are open.
[43:16.23]No, all the doors on the right side are just open.
[43:26.08]Did they edit?
[43:29.14]Did they edit that?
[43:29.86]I feel like I was there for much longer.
[43:41.25]They did.
[43:41.65]They fixed it in post.
[43:44.55]That's cool.
[43:47.11]Alright, that's Aftershock.
[43:54.44]Stunt City.
[43:55.70]Fire unlocked.
[43:58.51]No, there's more Aftershock.
[44:03.65]Here comes the escape.
[44:04.69]This is the end, for sure.
[44:07.37]Oh, no.
[44:08.37]I'm gonna blow this so bad.
[44:19.68]First, come to a complete stop, then hold your brake to take off in reverse.
[44:24.57]Once you've gathered some speed, move the wheel hard all the way to one side.
[44:28.86]That'll start your spin.
[44:32.92]talking in the background?
[44:33.90]No.
[44:34.00]Never gonna do it.
[44:35.42]Never gonna do it.
[44:36.16]Okay, I'll try.
[44:36.52]It's gonna take a few attempts.
[44:37.60]I do this in the parking lot all the time.
[44:38.94]Don't do that.
[45:01.44]Absolutely don't do that.
[45:02.80]What are you... Don't do that shit.
[45:04.46]Alright, complete the stunt.
[45:07.81]Let's go.
[45:08.25]Reverse 180.
[45:08.59]That was perfect.
[45:08.97]How was that not correct?
[45:13.29]Reverse 180.
[45:32.05]I got it.
[45:32.46]I got it.
[45:32.82]I got this.
[45:35.02]That's not bad.
[45:35.76]I got this.
[45:37.64]This is the final scene we'll be shooting for Aftershock.
[45:40.61]We've saved the toughest for last.
[45:42.67]You'll be doubling for the town's fire chief, escorting some fire engines across town.
[45:47.07]The marquee stunt here is a reverse 180 on the second floor of a parking garage.
[45:52.14]After you've whipped your car all the way around, like we practiced, you'll need to keep enough speed to crash through the barrier, fly out of the garage, and land on the other side of the lava floor.
[46:01.51]I have to actually break through a concrete barrier.
[46:04.47]So you better give it your all.
[46:06.25]You can't just paint a piece of cardboard gray.
[46:09.52]I have to have enough speed to drive through concrete.
[46:12.94]I want heroics on both sides of the camera.
[46:19.68]Alright, stay with them.
[46:22.54]Gap the cars.
[46:41.08]What?
[46:46.13]Somebody just threw a car at me.
[46:55.83]Where's the reverse 180?
[47:12.98]No, I'm fine.
[47:14.01]I'm fine.
[47:14.55]Why are you standing there?
[47:20.85]That's so dangerous.
[47:22.31]What the fuck are you thinking?
[47:25.07]That's insane.
[47:30.88]Just sitting in the middle of the road with all these explosions.
[47:36.70]I can still make it.
[47:39.38]Just leave this.
[47:47.24]Alright, here we go, here we go.
[47:49.84]Reverse 180, here it comes.
[47:58.26]What?
[47:59.50]Ah!
[48:03.06]Second floor, here we go.
[48:04.42]I gotta remember how to do this.
[48:07.21]Reverse 180.
[48:15.43]Stop and reverse!
[48:23.26]Stop it!
[48:24.74]What?!
[48:31.26]Bullshit.
[48:32.22]I had that.
[48:38.66]I did that perfectly fine.
[48:39.78]How are you supposed to go that fast through the barricade?
[48:50.73]I want to see this.
[48:55.51]Imagine setting all this up for another shot.
[48:57.98]Yeah.
[49:03.10]This scene alone was like a hundred and seventy five million dollars.
[49:08.06]You're not just gonna take it?
[49:09.56]That's the guy.
[49:20.92]There he is!
[49:21.54]He's here!
[49:23.06]That's the moment in the Disney movie when everyone's like, No, is he?
[49:28.70]Where is he?
[49:29.26]He's okay?
[49:30.56]And he's okay!
[49:31.21]And he comes out and sinks with three.
[49:46.22]I don't understand what went so wrong there.
[49:55.17]Why am I in a firefighter outfit?
[49:58.67]It doesn't- wait, am I a fireman or am I a policeman?
[50:03.21]Oh, I'm- okay, I am a firefighter.
[50:17.24]Here it is!
[50:23.96]I'm fine.
[50:26.04]I'm fine with that.
[50:27.59]Come on.
[50:28.17]Really?
[50:29.39]Do it again.
[50:33.93]A little too fast.
[50:40.55]I'm on two wheels right now.
[50:42.11]Okay.
[50:52.17]Stop going too fast.
[50:58.87]Is there a reason why I can't do this now?
[51:00.63]I did it first try last time.
[51:12.30]Explosion coming up.
[51:14.14]Frame rate.
[51:15.16]Nope.
[51:15.74]I'm a liar.
[51:21.52]Oh, shit.
[51:22.20]Mannequin.
[51:22.90]Oh!
[51:23.76]See, I landed from there that time.
[51:25.36]Did you see that?
[51:26.34]I hit my back tires with lava and I didn't fail.
[51:28.68]We call that bullshit.
[51:36.02]There goes another one.
[51:44.44]In the same spot.
[51:46.16]Doing it again.
[51:49.57]You'd think they would have learned from the last shoot.
[51:51.38]I'll have to be the same guy.
[52:04.82]I'm in there.
[52:05.50]I'm gonna get this right.
[52:12.76]I just have to go fast enough to get over the gap.
[52:25.53]Here we go.
[52:27.35]Here it comes.
[52:27.85]Here it comes.
[52:29.39]Here it comes.
[52:31.37]Here it comes.
[52:36.78]Is it?
[52:43.98]What?
[52:44.32]What is it?
[52:44.64]What do they want me to do there?
[52:47.72]What the fuck?
[52:48.20]What do you mean 180?
[52:53.36]I can't fuck anything else up.
[52:58.32]Come on.
[53:14.82]Through the gap.
[53:15.76]Don't touch anything.
[53:25.46]Got it.
[53:25.66]Just barely.
[53:28.82]No.
[53:31.56]We can't.
[53:35.92]Still two stars.
[53:36.54]I'm okay with that.
[53:39.17]Alright, let's watch the actual finished product.
[53:42.61]I know I can't skip.
[53:43.47]People are gonna be like, oh, you don't have to do it.
[53:48.49]Just skip it.
[53:48.85]It's gonna be like, no skipping.
[53:54.63]Earn 300 or more airtime points.
[54:00.83]World Stunt Award.
[54:01.69]Fire down below.
[54:04.89]Color Customizer unlocked.
[54:08.35]Okay, not allowed to skip, right?
[54:10.07]Let's see it.
[54:10.45]Pretty good start.
[54:21.08]You can hear the guy in there going, God damn.
[54:23.98]Shit.
[54:31.09]You see that dodge and it hit that car that was behind me and exploded We don't have to do we watch the whole movie is there any dialogue in this movie Or is it just these six scenes back-to-back I
[54:55.72]I got this pretty well.
[54:57.40]For the first time ever seeing that, it was alright.
[55:01.06]What?
[55:06.57]Oh, it's because I fell down.
[55:07.59]No, I didn't.
[55:12.49]They followed a... A camera guy just ran up the ramp.
[55:14.85]That was awesome, but I didn't even get points for it.
[55:33.24]We just need a gorilla reading a book at the end of this.
[55:53.58]Here we go!
[56:01.08]That hesitation.
[56:02.46]What am I supposed to do?
[56:03.66]This?
[56:04.94]That hard break into... No, no, I have to go forward.
[56:11.70]I'm concentrating so intently right now, because I had four strikes.
[56:15.84]It wasn't crispy enough.
[56:28.43]It's alright.
[56:39.49]I was escorting the fire truck, and the fire truck at the end didn't make it.
[56:43.25]Alright, movie tra- wait, movie trailer unlocked.
[56:55.63]No.
[56:58.68]Really?
[57:07.65]come on little buddy there's nothing to be afraid of so you're going to that softball tournament next Sunday did you guys feel that reports have just started to filter in from around the group we can't give you a solid death if you are anywhere in the county please get out now
[57:37.10]Driving on those roads is suicide.
[57:39.54]Staying here is suicide.
[57:44.20]You better be leaving me here.
[57:49.19]Chuck!
[57:55.37]You trying to be a hero?
[57:57.55]Just trying to stay alive, sir.
[58:09.29]Is that implying that the Earth is destroyed?
[58:37.65]The best part about all that is they make you really feel like you were a part of that.
[58:42.91]But they really only took two or three clips of me driving the straight line.
[58:49.86]Because I must have been so bad that they didn't get anything cool.
[58:54.08]They got me driving down the road.
[59:00.42]Director, intro, stunt coordinator.
[59:01.97]Alright, so.
[59:03.73]We're good, right?
[59:04.25]So I can just go?
[59:06.17]No, no, no, no, no.
[59:06.75]What the hell are you doing?
[59:07.63]Those weren't even my scenes.
[59:08.79]Time to reshoot.

[59:43.52]Oh, alright, I was gonna say, no way!
[59:51.06]Okay, so this is a whoopin' and a hollerin', two.
[59:58.01]Oh, we're going to be here for a while.
[59:59.65]Oh, yeah.
[60:00.86]Okay.
[60:01.30]This was whooping and hollering, too.
[60:05.35]What's up, dude?
[60:05.99]I'm the director, Andy Baxter.
[60:07.65]Andy in the house!
[60:10.27]Hey, guys, this is the stunt driver.
[60:12.58]You're the stunt driver, dude?
[60:14.30]I thought you only had beards.
[60:16.28]Guys, take these fireworks to my butt.
[60:18.08]Jim Boy's playing the lead, so you'll be doubling for him.
[60:20.66]Once for a reality show, we had Jim fly up a bridge in his shopping cart with handcuffs on him.
[60:25.14]That was sweet!
[60:25.72]That goat had it coming, man!
[60:28.73]That's our version of stunt driving, man.
[60:30.85]Anyway, dude, this flick's called Hoopin' and Hollerin' 2.
[60:33.43]It's a backwards, back-roadin' crackerfest with some troublemakin' brothers gettin' in car chases with the cops and all that kinda stuff.
[60:42.22]I can do that one.
[60:44.62]I can do that one.
[60:45.18]Have fun out there.
[60:45.82]I'll see you on the set.
[60:46.94]I don't even know where the set is.
[61:13.56]Look, kid, this director's a clown, so we may have to work double time to give the producers what they want.
[61:18.34]Get a Beigeling four-wheeler?
[61:20.68]You'll mostly double for the Creek Boys and their signature muscle car, the General Stewart, as they try to stop the corrupt sheriff from foreclosing on their family's land.
[61:28.62]You'll also have a scene on a dirt bike as the crazy brother Otis
[61:32.24]A fun scene as Uncle Cletus in his monster truck full of moonshine, and a great run as a bank robber in a hijacked armored truck.
[61:39.54]This will be your first time to shoot chase scenes, so be sure not to fall too far behind the lead car, or we'll have to stop and reset.
[61:46.59]Most of the action happens in the town square, but we've also got some exciting stunts planned in the junkyard and in the lumberyard.
[61:53.05]Baxter and his crew are all about backwoods mayhem, so I hope you're ready to tear things up.
[61:58.75]Literally.
[62:00.45]I'm ready.
[62:00.77]Crush.
[62:01.01]Alright.
[62:35.64]here we go I missed I've missed all the police cars
[62:58.70]No!
[62:59.62]I get a double?
[63:02.88]I'm not going to make it.
[63:05.88]I actually did.
[63:06.62]I just got nominated for an award.
[63:10.36]He's a kind of forklift.
[63:17.81]He's no longer me.
[63:27.46]I can do that better.
[63:32.76]This movie stinks.
[63:43.04]This movie stinks.
[63:44.95]No, I can do that better.
[63:55.42]What the fuck are you doing?
[64:24.28]Two one action hit the police car hit the police cars Hit the police car
[64:55.74]Right here, straight to the middle.
[65:01.77]Okay.
[65:02.05]Police car, straight through.
[65:03.99]Hard right.
[65:04.93]Got it.
[65:05.39]Police car.
[65:07.82]Jump into the tower.
[65:12.12]Hit it.
[65:21.76]Oh, I gotta get the jump.
[65:25.30]Use action.
[65:29.92]The rest of this movie could suck.
[65:31.79]It probably will.
[65:33.11]But it won't even matter because that was perfect.
[65:37.37]Get on, man.
[65:38.03]Whoa.
[65:38.25]It's a 10.
[65:39.09]It's like precision and precise.
[65:44.08]Get more stars.
[65:47.90]I did it.
[65:49.16]Five stars.
[65:50.54]Threader, spring an entire movie scene.
[65:54.10]Five star bonus.
[65:54.94]I'm like a five star replay.
[65:56.60]What does that mean?
[66:09.65]At least it's a better cut.
[66:10.99]I don't know.
[66:23.54]That was pretty clean, though, until we got over here.
[66:27.36]I still snuck it in.
[66:28.16]Look, ready?
[66:29.54]Whoops!
[66:29.93]Yeah, I still got it.
[66:37.97]That was next on the bike, right?
[66:48.25]Car commercial unlocked.
[66:51.30]Wait a minute.
[66:53.88]Is it a car commercial that I can do in this game?
[67:02.76]I'm looking forward to that one.
[67:05.20]In this scene, you'll double for some bank robbers as they try to escape the Creek Boys and the cops in a hijacked armored vehicle.
[67:11.69]The challenging stunt is this double overtake near the end.
[67:15.79]You've got to pass the police car, then thread the needle to pass the semi.
[67:20.51]If you haven't built up enough speed, you'll smash into the semi head-on, so make sure to lay heavy on the throttle.
[67:26.80]And remember, the more collateral damage, the better.
[67:30.08]This is an assault on the senses.
[67:32.40]It really is.
[67:38.96]110,000 points.
[67:39.96]Ah, sorry.
[67:40.22]Scrape the police car.
[68:08.57]Through the gap.
[68:09.17]Yeah, yeah.
[68:10.51]Hit the police car.
[68:12.99]I can do this better.
[68:16.33]Overtake.
[68:16.69]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[68:18.55]Three, two, one, action.
[68:23.43]Scrape the police car.
[68:25.98]Hard left.
[68:26.86]Take him up.
[68:28.32]Come on.
[68:30.90]Oh, dude.
[68:33.44]I gotta be right to the left.
[68:34.48]Three, two, one.
[68:42.70]Take him out.
[68:47.27]There it is.
[68:48.13]Hard right.
[68:52.53]Ripped.
[68:53.09]Still got to... No!
[68:55.94]Got to... Through the gap.
[69:00.70]Don't touch anything.
[69:01.62]Come on.
[69:03.76]You can be great again, really.
[69:08.63]That was bullshit.
[69:13.18]It's okay.
[69:17.18]It's okay.
[69:18.18]I can still finish it.
[69:21.18]I didn't even tell what was gonna happen.
[69:28.45]They just killed me.
[69:43.51]You don't live through that.
[69:47.04]That was driver's side.
[69:49.10]Driver's side.
[69:50.74]Five-star replay.
[70:14.29]That's the scenario, I think.
[70:16.85]It's just, everything turned off.
[70:20.41]The game freezes when you are done with a level, but that is what would happen.
[70:26.49]I'm driving down that road, and then it's off, everything's off.
[70:41.52]Oh, shit.
[70:42.40]Good job, boys.
[70:50.86]I can't.
[70:53.16]I can't.
[70:54.46]I want to see it again.
[70:56.34]One more time.
[71:14.56]Yeah, that was really as if somebody spawned that truck in.
[71:34.56]I might like that more than I might like the last one.
[71:44.15]It's like a perfect cut, too.
[71:49.69]This game is awesome.
[71:57.27]Mail run.
[71:59.80]Next, you'll stunt for Otis Creek, the brother with a couple screws loose.
[72:03.95]He's taking revenge on the corrupt sheriff by disrupting his beloved Catfish County Chicken Day parade.
[72:10.27]Your big stunt is an extended wheelie.
[72:13.00]Gap between these cop cars, then one-wheel it all the way across the porch.
[72:17.16]One wheel all the way across?
[72:18.06]It'll come down hot, so you'll have enough speed to take this final jump.
[72:21.87]And don't let the giant chickens distract you.
[72:25.01]Andy, how come you always get to call that?
[72:26.81]Because I'm the director, dude.
[72:28.09]Shut up!
[72:28.37]Shut up!
[72:28.81]Oh, man.
[72:30.41]You're stuck up.
[72:31.11]You're different, dude.
[72:34.93]Three, two, one.
[72:36.63]Action!
[72:36.79]There's a giant chance.
[72:39.92]Hard left.
[72:42.34]Through the gap.
[72:44.08]Hit the boxes.
[72:46.12]Okay, well... Pass close to the truck.
[72:48.78]Hard left.
[72:51.12]Overtake left.
[73:04.35]Wait, what?
[73:08.93]Did I make it?
[73:09.67]I'm just still concerned about the guy that just got crushed!
[73:31.38]Through the gap?
[73:31.90]What?
[73:33.92]No!
[73:35.70]It's okay.
[73:36.42]It's okay.
[73:37.20]It's okay.
[73:37.52]It's okay.
[73:37.96]It's okay.
[73:38.46]It's okay.
[73:50.29]It's okay.
[73:50.85]No!
[73:51.05]I thought it was going to be on the ground.
[73:54.34]Well, I want to see.
[73:55.20]Let me see what happens here.
[73:58.12]Because somehow I jumped the car.
[74:05.67]Nice POV camera.
[74:11.83]This is sped up.
[74:19.94]Double jump!
[74:26.56]All I can do is, like, laugh at this game.
[74:31.98]Like, I got nothing else to say right now.
[74:51.37]Alright, I can do it here.
[74:57.85]Play again, let's go.
[75:00.64]This guy don't hit the car.
[75:08.22]I gotta go overtake left.
[75:14.63]Over here.
[75:28.83]We both got hit by that fucking truck.
[75:33.39]We both got hit.
[75:35.15]Oh, I need to calm down.
[75:36.61]I can still do it.
[75:46.17]I just don't, don't fuck anything up.
[75:47.98]I gotta get up here.
[75:49.10]Up on the ledge.
[75:50.98]Oh my goodness.
[75:53.60]Okay, damn it's up here, over here.
[75:55.86]Can I float?
[76:06.89]Come on!
[76:08.91]It's alright.
[76:17.43]Jesus!
[76:20.45]Really?
[76:24.08]Okay, I'm gonna take that one.
[76:28.86]I want to see if we both get hit by the semi at the same time.
[76:43.98]That was brutal.
[76:44.78]Everything was going real well up until that point.
[77:12.59]Who is the third dead person?
[77:14.79]There was somebody lying under the tire.
[77:19.27]Who is the other guy?
[77:22.77]He gets back up the...
[77:37.73]Another stuntman came and got on the bike and drove it away.
[77:47.48]So two people got murdered right there, and then behind the truck another stuntman was like, oh shit, get on there and drive away.
[77:53.81]With the same jacket.
[77:58.33]I need, we gotta, I wanna see that again.
[78:00.21]I need to, I wish I could slow it down.
[78:03.68]Is that what actually happened?
[78:10.10]So, there's two people involved here.
[78:19.67]Okay, here we go.
[78:23.80]Dead!
[78:25.68]So, where's the third person?
[78:32.15]I can't even fucking think about that right now.
[78:38.29]That was a hard cut.
[78:40.23]That was a hard jump cut.
[78:42.91]Strike Force Omega Unlocked.
[78:44.37]Alright, we're not done with this one yet.
[78:49.54]Why wouldn't they make another one of these games?
[78:53.44]Where's Stuntman 4?
[78:54.40]Because I know there's one more, right?
[78:59.76]That's not gonna be good.
[79:17.47]It wasn't the third one?
[79:18.09]Yeah.
[79:18.47]I guess.
[79:53.25]I can't believe all Might is talking to Germo.
[79:58.20]Yeah, neither can I.
[80:19.87]Drive on two wheels.
[80:20.77]Oh, you sure you didn't want me to get on the right side and slide?
[80:24.39]No, what the fuck?
[80:32.36]Why is it so hard to do this?
[80:37.60]Every time, hold on.
[80:39.88]It just ripped over.
[80:41.00]Three, two, one, go.
[80:44.50]Drive on two wheels.
[80:53.19]Dude, it's really hard to do this.
[80:55.29]I have to be going slower.
[80:58.79]Three, two, one, go!
[81:01.70]Drive on two wheels.
[81:07.88]Get down!
[81:08.54]Get the wheel down!
[81:12.54]This is actually really hard to do.
[81:14.92]It's really kind of... Three, two, one, go!
[81:21.41]Drive on two wheels.
[81:27.04]But see, I can't turn.
[81:28.17]If I turn, the car starts to fall down.
[81:32.60]And I just technically did it.
[81:33.56]Let me do it again.
[81:36.30]Okay.
[81:36.58]Now you'll double for the Creek Boys, racing to City Hall to save the family farm.
[81:41.58]Other than some two-wheeling at the top... Once the wheels are in the air, if I hit left or right stick, it goes up or down.
[81:47.60]I can't turn the car.
[81:49.89]After a left turn, come in straight and clean with a good amount of heat so you can pull the 180 right as you pass the semi.
[81:56.57]It'll take some practice to learn exactly where to start the drift, so don't sweat a few retakes.
[82:06.44]Three two one action three
[82:35.61]Excuse me.
[82:36.05]What's wrong here?
[82:37.01]Why is this not a U-turn?
[82:39.49]Straight.
[82:40.09]Didn't even hit anybody.
[83:14.74]It's okay, I got it.
[83:15.46]I broke it anyways.
[83:30.26]Hit the object.
[83:33.46]I got it.
[83:39.24]Two wheels!
[83:39.74]No.
[83:46.30]Not bad!
[83:46.96]I did it first pretty much first real try.
[83:49.28]Ow!
[83:49.44]This is so funny!
[83:50.64]This is some shit.
[83:53.64]Yes.
[83:57.35]Oh, I got the nomination.
[83:59.51]First time.
[84:00.09]Bonus unlocked.
[84:05.59]Two-wheeled ramp.
[84:06.39]Bonus.
[84:06.61]Let's take a look.
[84:14.31]Two people in the car now.
[84:18.87]I did do that pretty well.
[84:20.75]That was... And I didn't hit a single person.
[84:26.91]Didn't even hit that guy.
[84:29.09]I was focused.
[84:30.41]Except for that part.
[84:35.53]I had to break the glass.
[84:56.06]Can't wait to see the trailer for this one.
[84:57.42]There's only probably one or two more cities, right?
[85:04.10]I've improved.
[85:04.54]Look at 3-3-2-2-2-2.
[85:04.86]This is 5-4-3-3.
[85:05.20]Getting better.
[85:23.83]This next scene's a race between the Creek Boys and another redneck in his souped-up hot rod.
[85:29.19]The key is to follow the lead car.
[85:31.25]We'll have it clearly marked.
[85:32.96]You can't bump it too hard, can't get ahead, and can't fall too far behind.
[85:37.42]There'll be some jumps, 180s, and other stunts where you'll lose sight of the lead, but relax.
[85:42.34]Long as you stay the course and keep roasting your tires, you'll meet back up with it soon.
[85:47.46]Don't get too close.
[85:48.66]Stay close enough where you're still in the game, and don't overtake them.
[85:53.37]Pretend like you're playing your little brother in Mario Kart.
[85:57.13]Quiet on the set, everybody.
[85:58.71]I'm serious.
[85:59.70]Shut the hell up.
[86:01.20]I have to concentrate on making this movie not suck.
[86:03.66]Alright, let's go.
[86:08.62]Three, two, one, action.
[86:11.70]Follow the lead vehicle.
[86:14.18]I just need to see if he's moving.
[86:16.52]Scrape the vehicle.
[86:19.58]Hard right.
[86:20.04]I didn't even scrape it.
[86:44.16]That was a much better stunt than what they wanted me to do.
[86:46.00]No!
[86:46.12]I did the... how would I even know I was supposed to do that?
[87:10.91]You can't just... you gotta...
[87:23.05]This is gonna be the worst one.
[87:25.41]Jump the logs!
[87:29.13]Okay.
[87:30.29]Sure.
[87:31.15]Just do it again.
[87:34.06]Why would I drive into that if I'm chasing this guy?
[88:00.89]I'll just add my own stuns, fine.
[88:18.94]Big drift.
[88:21.81]Up!
[88:21.95]I'm doing my own stuns.
[88:36.57]No!
[88:36.89]The tree just ruined everything!
[88:39.08]Why did you do that?
[88:40.80]I had like a 4 or 5 star going too.
[88:57.05]What?
[89:02.79]There he is.
[89:03.17]I'm fine.
[89:06.34]Oh shit, I gotta... Oh my god, how... was I supposed to know?
[89:22.61]Oh no.
[89:30.76]It's fine.
[89:32.64]It's okay.
[89:34.71]I was like... Okay.
[89:36.35]Hold on, let me at least finish it.
[89:39.29]No, no, no, no, no.
[89:41.33]Hit the ramp.
[89:42.67]Land on the semi.
[89:54.46]Now what?
[89:55.32]Okay.
[89:59.18]I can't even... We'll just watch the damn replay.
[90:03.06]It doesn't even matter.
[90:03.81]Whatever.
[90:08.91]Bomberjack will lead.
[90:16.16]General Stewart.
[90:19.00]You are average.
[90:21.06]Well, two and a half would be average.
[90:23.16]A little bit above average.
[90:27.46]Let's see it in full motion video.
[90:44.47]Had my own stunt here.
[90:47.69]I jumped this entire semi.
[90:52.01]That's some people moving from ship right there.
[91:13.90]Oh yeah, I did that too on my own.
[91:26.36]The chicken sound was perfect.
[91:30.68]Here we go.
[91:33.32]Hopefully it's a good view.
[91:44.04]See the temptation there to just run that guy over?
[91:46.64]I didn't do it, though.
[91:47.94]I wanted to finish this.
[92:09.02]There we go.
[92:12.30]Hahaha.
[92:14.16]That was actually way, way better.
[92:21.31]The music stops and the music picks back up.
[92:24.51]By design, as intended.
[92:33.08]That was awesome.
[92:38.54]That was awesome.
[92:45.17]Alright, Stunt City Team Unlocked.
[92:57.90]Here we go.
[93:00.14]We are at the final scene of Looping and Hollering.
[93:07.11]This is the other side of the bank robber chase you shot in grab-and-go last scene for this movie this time You'll play the creek boys trying to stop the hijacked armored vehicle to get some reward Do I get a Mario Kart ghost that plays on the screen to the chase scene?
[93:20.65]So remember don't fall too far behind the lead The key stunt is a jump onto the upper deck of a storefront hit the jump and break through the balusters
[93:30.16]Once on top, keep that speed going to hit the jump and clear the semi.
[93:34.50]Alright, let's get out there and break some stuff.
[93:36.70]That would be awesome if it actually is the other car's name.
[93:38.92]Then we can have our freaking wrap party!
[93:40.80]Wrap party, man!
[93:41.94]I'm gonna take my clothes off.
[93:43.22]I'm gonna watch you, man.
[93:48.00]That was all over one radio.
[93:50.24]They're all leaning in.
[93:52.78]Three, two, one, action!
[94:00.56]That's me, right?
[94:02.46]That's other me.
[94:09.37]It's definitely other me, because it's driving like a fucking idiot.
[94:25.48]Scrape!
[94:26.86]Oh, I just barely scraped.
[94:30.55]Scrape!
[94:32.27]Again.
[94:32.53]Okay, good.
[94:36.61]I am.
[94:42.83]That was tricky, but I did it.
[94:44.03]Oops.
[94:45.59]I think I just accidentally killed that person.
[95:04.55]Did I get it?
[95:04.91]I got it.
[95:17.08]Now what?
[95:23.50]That's a real hard left.
[95:37.53]Oh, come on.
[95:39.07]Damn it.
[95:39.81]That's not... That's going to be the end.
[95:41.37]That's going to be the end of me.
[95:47.19]No, not even... Into the tires?
[95:49.96]Um... Do I have to keep going?
[95:56.74]Apparently not.
[96:11.65]We're in a one-star ranking for all season in an all-around, okay?
[96:16.80]Taurus World Stunt Ward.
[96:18.36]Ooh.
[96:20.76]More color customization.
[96:28.17]Don't skip.
[96:28.95]You don't skip it.
[96:51.13]Why is this not there?
[96:51.81]That was pretty tight.
[97:01.16]I do something up here that I'm really proud of, actually.
[97:03.56]I weave in and out of, like, four or five trees.
[97:05.28]Like, right here.
[97:05.82]Ready?
[97:06.64]One, two, three trees, four trees, five trees, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen trees.
[97:12.29]You see that?
[97:25.89]15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 20, 22, 23, 24.
[97:26.35]Most of those were lamps.
[97:56.40]I'm excited for the trailer.
[97:57.32]I'm going to do the commercial.
[97:58.54]Oh, fuck off.
[97:59.34]Nice.
[97:59.50]Three stars.
[98:00.18]Nice.
[98:27.09]Alright, time to be quiet and watch the trailer.
[98:31.12]Alright, alright, now how do I look?
[98:33.34]Do I look mean?
[98:34.40]Oh yeah, you look mean, Sheriff.
[98:36.70]You look mean.
[98:37.79]Well, maybe this will be enough to remind them boys whose town it is.
[99:11.28]Get those boars!
[99:57.20]There we go.
[99:59.92]Ah, that was Hooping in a Hall Room 2.
[100:09.69]Where's the commercial?
[100:12.13]Oddjobs.
[100:12.95]Ooh!
[100:14.23]Stunt City Club.
[100:15.17]Hold on.
[100:16.57]Repersals.
[100:18.01]Hold on, here we go.
[100:19.89]Stunt City Fire.
[100:20.89]Car commercial.
[100:21.85]I'm doing the car commercial.
[100:27.65]In this commercial, you'll play a citizen of darkdom driving the new Venus Vexation sports car.
[100:33.67]The gags that you out-drive Night Avenger because your car is so fast.
[100:38.33]You'll be using Nitro and the key run happens during your second boost.
[100:42.75]Speed past the exploding cars and under the torch semi.
[100:47.45]Then overtake Night Avenger on the left and end with a huge drift right.
[100:51.75]Turning will be hard at high speed, so you'll have to anticipate the stunts early.
[101:00.65]You're faster than Batman in product placement.
[101:03.25]Okay.
[101:04.59]I'm ready.
[101:05.35]There's Batman.
[101:06.93]Alright, I gotta be cleaner than that.
[101:33.85]No failures are allowed.
[101:53.49]What?
[101:54.09]I didn't even know it was over there.
[101:58.68]Oh, come on.
[101:59.36]I can do it.
[102:01.22]Three, two, one, action.
[102:06.85]Drip left.
[102:09.27]Pass close.
[102:13.05]Did I not do it?
[102:18.89]Oh.
[102:19.01]Three, two, one, action.
[102:21.91]Oh, shit.
[102:22.45]This is one of those addicting goddamn games where it's going to make me just sit here for like a hour, isn't it?
[102:27.11]Drip left.
[102:33.46]I tried to pass close, but he flew backwards.
[102:37.10]What's going on here?
[102:56.42]Drip left.
[102:56.78]Am I scraping it?
[102:59.86]Pass close.
[103:00.54]Cap the cars.
[103:02.94]Dude, this car is too fast.
[103:04.48]3, 2, 1.
[103:07.96]Action.
[103:08.70]Drip left.
[103:12.09]Just show them this.
[103:13.65]Who cares about the cars?
[103:17.91]Cap the cars.
[103:19.53]Use action.
[103:21.07]Overtake on the right.
[103:23.91]Drip turn right.
[103:30.23]What?
[103:31.25]Cut.
[103:36.37]I couldn't even... What the fuck are you talking about?
[103:42.69]Get close to the explosion.
[103:43.81]You blew it up on top of me.
[103:45.71]Pass close.
[103:49.86]Cap the cars.
[103:50.58]Use action.
[103:52.58]Overtake on the right.
[104:01.57]I'm faster than Batman already.
[104:03.28]I'm faster than Batman.
[104:06.68]Tell him to speed up.
[104:08.02]Can we switch cars?
[104:09.30]Just paint this one black.
[104:15.79]Just give him this one.
[104:36.36]What happened?
[104:40.94]What happened there?
[104:41.44]What happened?
[104:42.20]I didn't do anything.
[104:44.48]I didn't do anything.
[104:46.30]I overtook him.
[104:47.02]I drove in front of him.
[104:49.80]How else do you overtake somebody besides driving around them?
[105:14.65]Am I going too slow?
[105:24.05]3, 2, 1
[105:33.44]I did overtake this thing.
[105:35.72]He didn't say overtake.
[105:36.94]Big watch, ready?
[105:40.78]So I overtake this guy.
[105:43.16]I did it.
[105:48.77]I literally drive right next to the cop car and overtake him.
[106:16.94]Okay, here we go.
[106:19.43]Ready?
[106:19.77]Did that not count?
[106:27.69]I don't understand.
[106:33.07]Why did it take so long to fail again?
[106:42.74]Why is it waiting until the end of the level to fail again?
[107:04.26]Is that really all of them?
[107:07.38]I got y'all!
[107:14.40]Cut!
[107:14.91]And that's a wrap, boys and girls.
[107:16.87]We've got ourselves a commercial.
[107:22.71]I can pick a five on this one.
[107:24.49]Let's do five.
[107:25.05]I can pick a five on this one.
[107:49.17]That was close.
[107:49.83]That was close.
[107:50.49]That's all good shit.
[107:54.30]I can defend.
[107:56.58]Last try, that's it.
[108:20.86]I crushed- I'm spamming Triangle!
[108:23.12]Why?
[108:24.04]Oh, I'm so angry right now.
[108:25.98]I'm fucking furious.
[108:28.50]Literally sitting there hitting Triangle.
[108:30.16]Doesn't make any sense.
[108:45.66]That is impossible that I didn't get that.
[108:47.92]It's actually impossible.
[108:54.89]Look at the chat, hold on.
[108:55.97]This is it, this is the last one I'm gonna do and then I'm gonna fucking pee and come back.
[111:00.76]Thank you.
[111:50.28]Hey, let's go.
[111:55.86]Fire.
[111:57.70]In this show, you'll drive a bike that's on fire, causing explosions as you drive close to propane tanks and other vehicles.
[112:04.75]The big moment in the show starts with a slide beneath this semi, igniting it.
[112:09.53]Then throw a 180 between the propane tanks, making them blow up too.
[112:14.72]As soon as you've spun around, line up for the big ramp and gun it hard.
[112:18.68]He beat up his pillow into the bedroom, just like... Hey guys, I'm back.
[112:28.60]What's going on?
[112:30.50]Welcome back to the stream.
[112:33.91]Ladies and gents, the Human Matchstick!
[112:40.89]Jesus, this looks dangerous.
[113:01.26]Look at how big that jump is over there
[113:14.40]You're gonna put traps everywhere for me?
[113:15.86]That's not nice.
[113:16.82]That's unsafe.
[113:17.76]Got it.
[113:18.66]That's so good.
[113:35.31]180.
[113:37.73]Oh!
[113:38.05]He got stuck that way earlier.
[113:39.31]He's going too fast.
[113:42.06]Yeah, you're going way, way, way, way too fast.
[113:43.62]I'm gonna start to slow it down here.
[114:12.75]I mean, I technically still did it, so it's okay.
[114:22.99]Jesus!
[114:28.61]That was like going down a roller coaster.
[114:31.85]How do you like that, folks?
[114:33.53]Let's hear it for that inconceivable, unbelievable performance!
[114:37.65]Oh, man!
[114:43.06]Four!
[114:43.58]I'll take four.
[114:53.88]Check it out.
[115:24.60]I landed on the front tire and stuck it.
[115:34.67]That was pretty insane.
[115:37.61]There's one more here.
[115:46.83]Uh, Stunt City Team.
[115:50.85]Might as well do them.
[115:51.47]Back to Batman.
[115:52.00]I'll show the Batman replay after this.
[115:53.50]This one sucks.
[115:54.50]This one's horrible.
[115:55.00]It's okay.
[116:22.39]Only 60,000 points Oh
[116:50.73]You gotta be perfect there.
[116:52.18]Ooh.
[116:53.36]Ooh.
[116:53.62]Alright.
[116:54.30]Do it!
[116:55.96]What?
[116:57.64]I have to keep going all the way back?
[117:21.35]I gotta go start the turn in the box.
[117:23.49]Okay.
[117:25.27]I figured I could just go through the box.
[117:28.39]You're gonna restart because somebody else crashed.
[117:47.81]That's not me.
[117:48.65]The camera's not even on me now.
[117:49.61]The camera's on me.
[117:52.82]close to the first car now push to the second and now stop and reverse 180. here comes the reverse 180. damn it
[118:29.98]Oh, shit.
[118:30.18]Close to the first car.
[118:31.66]Now push to the second.
[118:34.18]And now stop and reverse 180.
[118:36.67]Here comes the reverse 180.
[118:42.77]Come on.
[118:44.15]What the hell?
[118:45.15]3, 2, 1, action.
[118:47.30]Close to the first car.
[118:51.64]Now push to the second.
[118:54.58]And now stop and reverse 180.
[119:06.32]What's happening?
[119:09.10]What the fuck is happening?
[119:13.06]What the hell do you want me to do after that?
[119:14.42]It didn't say... What?
[119:22.64]What happens after the reverse 180?
[119:24.63]Do I have to drive by the drivers again?
[119:34.43]I... Okay.
[119:35.31]I get it.
[119:39.37]I have to drive near that guy.
[119:43.13]Okay.
[120:03.65]Did I do it?
[120:06.48]I did it.
[120:08.36]Oh, no!
[120:08.94]Give me a break.
[120:09.96]I was right there.
[120:12.14]I caught running out of gas at the finish line.
[120:32.07]I'll get it.
[120:34.93]I'm holding right on the pad.
[120:50.40]I was holding right that whole time.
[120:52.14]Unbelievable.
[120:53.12]I can't believe I didn't fucking stop at that.
[120:55.32]Unbelievable.
[120:59.18]Unbelievable.
[121:01.39]I touched him.
[121:02.25]Game over.
[121:06.75]I was holding right trigger.
[121:08.17]I was!
[121:08.65]Dude, I could see, like, 17, 18-year-old me losing his fucking mind.
[121:19.68]I'm 34 losing my mind, too.
[121:22.62]Doesn't matter.
[121:28.94]That age doesn't matter.
[121:39.78]No, I'm frozen.
[121:44.98]When I hovered over this, somebody in all caps wrote, this one is horrible.
[121:52.29]And I was like, what are you talking about?
[122:01.87]Get in there!
[122:02.81]I did it.
[122:03.73]Everything's fine.
[122:07.42]Don't worry about it.
[122:08.06]It's good.
[122:08.54]I'm good to go.
[122:11.20]Everything's perfect.
[122:22.61]I'll take four.
[122:23.41]I don't want to see the replay in this one.
[122:26.28]I don't want to see it.
[122:28.26]It's angering me even smelling this in my vicinity.
[123:06.45]It actually gave me the boost I needed.
[123:07.93]There you go.
[123:21.26]Alright, back to the career menu.
[123:23.86]Where's the Batman ad?
[123:28.18]Overdrive unlocked.
[123:32.48]I can't show you the replay of the Batman.
[123:34.02]I have to... In this commercial, you'll play a citizen of darkdom driving the new Venus Vexation sports car.
[123:40.96]The gags that you outdrive Night Avenger because your car is so fast.
[123:45.63]You'll be using Nitro, and the key run happens during your second boost.
[123:50.05]Speed past the exploding cars and under the torch semi.
[123:54.57]Then overtake Night Avenger on the left and end with a huge drift right.
[123:58.89]Turning will be hard at high speed, so you'll have to anticipate the stunt.
[124:03.12]Nice gag.
[124:04.72]Everyone was saying show the replay.
[124:06.80]Because I skipped it because I freaked out.
[124:11.70]Load.
[124:12.00]I didn't save a replay.
[124:13.02]Alright, here we go.
[124:13.96]3, 2, 1, action!
[124:15.68]Drift left.
[124:19.27]Path closed.
[124:37.59]I swear to God!
[124:38.69]I swear to God!
[124:39.33]You have to understand something.
[124:42.40]There's no way I fucked that up.
[124:43.92]I'm hitting triangle.
[124:45.98]Like this.
[124:46.26]Do you understand?
[124:47.76]Like, that happened twice now.
[124:49.00]Like, in the same spot.
[124:50.28]In the same spot.
[124:50.94]I'm hitting triangle.
[124:52.02]Like, what?
[124:52.56]I've never... What?
[124:53.12]What?
[124:55.85]That doesn't make any sense!
[124:59.09]Tri- Triangle's the button!
[125:00.41]I swear to God, that happened.
[125:01.83]Like, clip this, and clip one from the floor.
[125:04.58]That happened to the same spot.
[125:06.82]That's- I swear, I promise.
[125:09.70]Why would I not- Look, oh, it's triangle!
[125:11.24]Okay.
[125:12.90]I just forget how to play the game.
[125:17.61]Ready?
[125:25.87]That's not five stars?
[125:27.59]Alright, I'm gonna skip this.
[125:45.70]I got the five-star replay.
[125:50.10]Here.
[125:51.09]Just pretend this is like 25.
[125:59.69]The new Venus Vexation, with 850 horsepower, dual GPS navigation, titanium body structure, and bulletproof glass, will make even a superhero jealous with envy.
[126:13.14]Take control of the night with the all-new Vexation from Venus.
[126:17.72]Machismo.
[126:29.35]That was really, really bad at rehearsals.
[126:36.44]Alright.
[126:36.80]Aftershock.
[126:37.24]Here we go.
[126:37.98]Strike Force Omega.
[126:43.20]Oh, man.
[126:43.96]I asked for someone with bigger muscles.
[126:47.54]Hey, I'm Carl Steele, director and star of Strike Force Omega.
[126:51.70]After 15 years topping bills in action movies, they finally let me direct my own.
[126:57.35]I started off as a stuntman like you.
[126:59.87]I should be doing the driving myself, but the studio says no way.
[127:03.43]Guess I'm too valuable, right?
[127:05.29]Bet your ass I am.
[127:07.09]Strike Force Omega's about a special ops unit secretly bankrolled by the U.S., stopping a group of mercs from hijacking some nasty WMDs in the former Soviet state of Kyrgyzstan.
[127:17.72]Is that a missile on the truck?
[127:19.50]The squad's butt-kicking leader, Commander Black.
[127:22.72]You'll drive a souped-up army-style truck with .50 caliber auto turret.
[127:26.62]It's a badass with a capital B.
[127:29.61]Anyway, lots of my fans still think I do my own stunts, so you better be good.
[127:33.49]I got a reputation to protect.
[127:35.86]Now I need to go bulk up for my next fight scene.
[127:37.82]I'll see you on the set.
[127:39.36]What?
[127:40.36]You looking for an autograph?
[127:42.18]Hey, Marcus, get him one of those commemorative eye patches.
[127:48.35]I'll tell you, nothing beats working with a director who thinks he should be driving for you.
[127:53.05]I've worked with Steele before, and trust me, he's not easy to please.
[127:56.94]But the good news is the man knows how to make an exciting action film, so we've got some killer stunts lined up.
[128:02.26]Some of the vehicles in this movie are heavily armed and include a modified dune buggy, a motorcycle, an unwieldy semi towing a giant scud missile, and Commander Black's heavily armed assault vehicle, the Scorpion.
[128:14.37]The location is mostly open desert terrain where you'll be driving on loosely packed dirt.
[128:19.39]But you'll also need to weave your way through the strike force base where there isn't much room to maneuver.
[128:23.91]You'll also have your first chance to use nitrous, giving you an extra punch of speed when you need to make that fast escape.
[128:30.03]Listen to me and hit your marks and you should walk away with some impressive additions.
[128:34.57]You'll start as a Strike Force Omega operative trying to get a stolen Scud missile back to base.
[128:40.23]The focus stunt is a side swipe of a combat bus.
[128:43.91]Don't aim straight for the bus or you'll get drawn out too far.
[128:47.86]Instead, aim for the gap in the bridge ahead.
[128:50.10]Aim for the gap in the bridge.
[128:50.90]That'll run you up so you can veer slightly to side swipe the bus before taking the gap.
[128:56.44]Alright, stuntman.
[128:58.19]Let's see what you can do behind the wheel of this bad boy.
[129:01.83]This thing's gonna launch.
[129:03.20]This is not like an active missile, right?
[129:07.80]I guess it's T-posing.
[129:10.88]Just in case anybody was wondering.
[129:19.27]Whoa, that moves with it.
[129:23.15]Okay.
[129:24.61]That's a tricky turn with this thing.
[129:32.14]Just start over.
[129:48.05]Just start over.
[129:52.20]I was trying to swipe him with the tail.
[130:08.06]around we go great come on get the other one nope didn't get it
[130:42.46]Is this thing gonna blow?
[130:44.36]Oh!
[130:46.73]I just rode across the bridge.
[130:52.25]They blew the bridge that I was crossing.
[131:04.55]Once it became clear that I wasn't gonna go over the jump, why would you still blow the bridge?
[131:09.43]That seems like a bad idea.
[131:25.32]Double.
[131:25.84]Nice.
[131:26.36]Okay, keep it up.
[131:28.87]I gotta go over the jump here.
[131:35.72]That just fucked me up.
[131:57.66]Shit.
[131:58.80]Left, right, left, right.
[132:01.80]That was panic turning.
[132:03.98]Sorry, three stars, I'll take it.
[132:14.01]Let's take a look So what I got caught on something over here
[132:44.46]I didn't kill the other... I didn't hit the other guy.
[132:46.12]I just scraped his friend.
[132:58.51]That was it right there.
[132:59.31]That was the issue.
[133:08.63]Actually, it was not even that bad.
[133:09.99]It was pretty good, actually.
[133:14.90]That was fine.
[133:15.46]There's the gap, yo.
[133:24.23]Motorcycle mission, let's go.
[133:26.01]Now you'll double for a strike force scout returning to base with vital intelligence.
[133:31.07]A challenging stunt is an aerial gap through a passing semi and into its trailer.
[133:36.34]Come over a hill, then straighten up fast so you can aim for the jump.
[133:40.54]Don't make last second adjustments once you're on the ramp.
[133:43.08]That'll mess you up.
[133:44.40]After you land, you'll need to slide beneath a second trailer, so be ready.
[133:48.50]Oh, God.
[133:49.20]If you're any good on a bike, this shouldn't be too tough.
[133:52.46]Okay, I'm...
[133:56.36]I guess we're gonna go... I'm just gonna go for it.
[134:05.81]Okay.
[134:11.47]What a movie scene!
[134:13.79]Our hero overtakes the criminal on the... Bye!
[134:20.42]I'm not even wearing a fucking helmet!
[134:21.78]No!
[134:22.14]I know!
[134:22.64]I'm s- This guy is seriously get- Now what?
[134:27.74]OH!
[134:53.48]What?
[134:53.84]I shot... I just... Did I do that?
[134:55.58]Did I really do that?
[135:13.77]There's no way I was gonna do that.
[135:18.30]Not a chance in hell.
[135:21.04]Absolute zero chance.
[135:28.24]Gap!
[135:28.48]I can't believe I just made it.
[135:35.87]I can do that one better.
[135:40.57]That's three, it's fine.
[136:03.31]The majority of this stream has been him saying a thing that I'm not ready for, and then me shockingly yelling the word he just said out loud.
[136:12.80]This is one of those comedy movies.
[136:15.00]And by the way, you gotta be careful for the gap.
[136:17.40]What gap?
[136:18.88]Gap?
[136:21.36]There it is.
[136:44.62]That was a pretty cool first-person cam.
[136:48.16]What?
[136:51.54]That was a little messed up, but it's okay.
[136:53.58]That first-person cam doesn't work there.
[136:56.62]It sounds like I hit something else, too.
[137:09.98]Okay.
[137:22.38]Pretty good.
[137:22.92]It's alright.
[137:23.98]I'll take three.
[137:30.85]Armor all.
[137:31.61]Commercial unlocked.
[137:33.01]Nice.
[137:35.33]Dogs of War.
[137:37.82]In this scene, you'll double for an enemy Merc, rampaging through the SFO base.
[137:42.64]The key stunt is a weaving triple bullet.
[137:45.95]Once you're in the base, drift left as quickly and sharply as possible so you can set up your line.
[137:51.41]Then thread between the three semis as they come straight at you.
[137:55.15]You'll pass right, then left, then right.
[137:57.75]This is another high-risk stunt, so keep it safe.
[138:01.59]You're playing an enemy Merc in this scene.
[138:03.75]I want him driving wild and crazy.
[138:05.91]Don't let me down.
[138:10.30]270,000 points.
[138:10.94]That's a lot.
[138:11.82]Oh.
[138:11.88]Ah, I'm not going to do that.
[138:46.58]The thing exploded.
[138:49.02]I can't pass it when it's gone.
[139:04.33]What explosion?
[139:05.93]This one.
[139:16.16]I love this game.
[139:17.04]This game is so bonkers.
[139:18.14]Three, two, one, action.
[139:21.04]Close to the explosion.
[139:22.08]Pass close to the explosion.
[139:26.78]Strip turn right.
[139:30.33]Fuck this pole.
[139:31.87]Fuck this pole.
[139:32.57]You know what I mean?
[139:34.33]No, fuck that pole.
[139:35.17]I'm not going to let that run.
[139:35.89]Three, two, one, action.
[139:39.49]Close to the explosion.
[139:49.35]Too much drifting.
[139:50.57]Too much drifting.
[139:52.21]Too much drifting.
[139:53.31]Drifting all over the place.
[139:54.51]Way too much of it.
[139:58.60]Pass this guy.
[139:59.22]Got it.
[140:13.20]Got it.
[140:22.64]Oh shit!
[140:28.42]Which one?
[140:38.96]Sloppy.
[140:39.54]Very sloppy.
[140:41.04]Too sloppy.
[140:42.32]But it's alright.
[140:47.06]This is really bad.
[140:49.57]This is really, really bad.
[140:51.49]This is really bad.
[140:56.79]Oh, man.
[141:03.72]There was a live animal in that car with me.
[141:06.83]That's the only way that I can describe the way I was moving around.
[141:09.28]Three, two, one, action.
[141:13.08]Close to the explosion.
[141:14.78]There was a fucking bear in that car.
[141:19.86]Three, two, one, action.
[141:23.56]Close to the explosion.
[141:26.20]As close to the explosion.
[141:31.03]This guy right here.
[141:34.13]That guy fucks it up every time.
[141:36.19]No!
[141:36.67]I gotta get around that.
[141:37.63]It's just... That pole sucks.
[141:41.75]There's a pole and then there's an exploded car.
[141:49.32]Right there.
[141:50.72]You gotta go around it.
[141:51.90]Here it is.
[141:58.94]Go.
[141:59.24]Pass over on here.
[142:01.33]He just turned into me.
[142:02.68]You're too close.
[142:05.34]3, 2, 1, action.
[142:05.96]Close to the explosion.
[142:36.35]Fuck you!
[142:37.45]No!
[142:39.43]That's such a small area to do that in.
[143:02.83]Too early, it's okay.
[143:20.49]No, that's gonna Not enough I got noted
[143:34.29]Oh, come on.
[143:34.99]I'm trying to line it up.
[143:42.25]That's not a direct turn left.
[143:43.23]I'm gonna fucking break.
[143:49.09]There's too many things going on.
[143:55.01]No, I gotta be in the fucking circle to do it!
[143:57.85]Oy yoy yoy.
[144:00.80]Too many instructions.
[144:02.54]Yeah, it really is.
[144:04.66]I'll get it.
[144:18.59]I'm gonna get an X here.
[144:19.65]No, I got it.
[144:22.41]Alright, smooth it out, smooth it out, smooth it out.
[144:25.58]I got it.
[144:40.27]got it come on okay I'm fine
[145:11.28]That was some good driving.
[145:14.16]Shit.
[145:16.26]Oh, no.
[145:19.31]No.
[145:24.99]Hmm.
[145:39.70]That's the whole reason for the stunt to be here in the first place.
[145:42.91]I went too fast.
[146:10.24]Slow down.
[146:13.93]I can't believe it.
[146:34.96]Okay.
[146:35.66]Come here.
[146:42.93]Please!
[146:43.37]Oh, here we go!
[146:46.09]I thought I was going too fast.
[146:54.51]It's alright, I can do it pretty clean now.
[147:14.20]Left.
[147:14.48]Drive up the ledge.
[147:17.74]Overtake left.
[147:18.04]That went too fast.
[147:18.72]I fucking hate that part.
[147:19.58]Into the fortress.
[147:26.15]Pass close.
[147:42.19]Oh, damn it.
[147:44.73]I gotta... I'm playing Simon Says with cars.
[148:03.49]Come on, that's, I can't touch it.
[148:05.79]I can't touch the fucking thing, even touch the tire.
[148:32.65]That's dumb.
[148:34.31]I'm being so careful trying to get it right.
[148:54.70]I just wanted to hit the helicopter.
[148:56.52]I don't care about anything else.
[148:58.32]Just let me hit the helicopter.
[148:59.42]I don't care!
[149:05.53]Hard left.
[149:07.53]Use action.
[149:10.81]Hit the helicopter.
[149:12.03]Jump into helicopter.
[149:14.44]Get it!
[149:16.08]Oh, no!
[149:17.20]3, 2, 1, action.
[149:20.96]Close to the explosion.
[149:23.50]Pass close to the explosion.
[149:26.26]I'm alright.
[149:27.84]Drift turn right.
[149:30.08]Close to the explosion.
[149:51.28]Fuck you.
[149:51.72]I had him.
[149:57.64]No, no, no, you motherfucker.
[149:59.82]Don't move here.
[150:10.93]No!
[150:11.03]That's when I hit the fucking helicopter.
[150:12.19]I don't care, just give me the fucking helicopter.
[150:14.17]Fuck you.
[150:27.20]Thank God!
[150:27.74]I'm finally out.
[150:31.86]It's worse than before.
[150:40.33]It's okay.
[150:43.87]It's fine.
[150:44.45]I'll be... I'm not... I don't want to see the... I'm fine.
[151:09.64]When do you get to play as Batman?
[151:10.78]That's a good question.
[151:14.49]Probably never.
[151:29.22]When it's cut up like that, it looks way cooler than my panic screams.
[151:50.64]What is this car made out of to be able to handle that?
[152:03.55]this is gonna be a fun one I can already tell now you'll double for commander black protecting a strike force convoy when they're ambushed by the murders a challenging line starts with you hitting two motorcycles at the exact same time which will make them both explode then immediately throw a 180 and quickly line up so you can avoid the semi that's speeding straight for you once you've passed the semi for your left to take out the next bike
[152:31.79]I'm gonna get hit by the truck 200,000 see if I can get it I missed one I was so focused on
[153:10.42]Right straight ahead Damn it!
[153:24.37]Can I still get him?
[153:31.37]Pass under it
[153:48.73]Dude, what?
[153:50.35]What do you want me to do?
[153:51.99]What do you want me to do here?
[153:53.25]Get the jump.
[154:06.82]Redo, redo, redo it.
[154:08.06]Restart, restart, restart, restart, restart.
[154:09.38]I thought that was the end.
[154:10.34]Three, two, one, action.
[154:14.42]Gap the semis.
[154:31.28]Perfect.
[154:32.57]Alright, let's make it happen.
[154:42.33]Pretty good.
[154:59.78]Come here I got it.
[155:03.38]I got it.
[155:04.88]I
[155:21.63]That was x42.
[155:22.67]Unfortunately, that sucks.
[155:26.45]It's alright.
[155:27.46]I'll take it.
[155:28.00]Scorpion unlocked.
[155:29.00]And a 5-star replay.
[155:31.52]Let's check it out.
[155:59.30]That's so bad.
[156:01.59]That's not even a stunt.
[156:02.75]I'm just actually fucking murdering those guys.
[156:19.26]This is so lukewarm at the end here though, really.
[156:35.55]You can't edit this to make this look any better.
[156:51.99]They kept that wide shot.
[156:53.41]That's the awkward shot.
[156:56.77]It's all in there for a little too long.
[156:59.79]That's funny.
[157:10.81]A couple more scenes behind enemy lines.
[157:13.57]In this scene, you'll play as Commander Black, escaping another ambush.
[157:17.30]The highlight is the use of nitrous to aid your getaway.
[157:20.18]There's a tricky line after your second burst of speed.
[157:23.28]You'll smash into the back of a merc buggy, knocking it into the air.
[157:27.33]Then pass beneath the collapsing silo before it falls and immediately let off the gas so you can drift hard left and stay on the road.
[157:35.79]Oh, yeah.
[157:36.87]We're bringing the nitro out.
[157:38.62]This is always my fave.
[157:42.07]Alright, let's go.
[157:42.97]240,000.
[157:44.65]Three, two, one, action.
[157:50.72]Use action.
[157:52.24]Hit the sign.
[157:54.40]Drift right.
[157:56.68]Good.
[157:58.01]That was good.
[157:58.47]Overtake the dune buggy.
[158:03.55]Pass close to explosions.
[158:04.73]I didn't.
[158:05.55]Come on.
[158:06.23]What the hell?
[158:15.35]No, not fast enough I did it.
[158:26.67]I technically still did it through the silo You got to be quick on this one
[158:48.97]What?
[158:50.15]Am I fast enough?
[158:52.55]No, I gotta go all the way to the left.
[158:59.49]All the way to the left.
[159:10.90]Explosion.
[159:14.54]Good.
[159:18.44]Gate.
[159:18.76]Got him.
[159:20.81]Kill.
[159:29.59]Whoa.
[159:29.95]Whoa.
[159:30.31]Whoa.
[159:30.69]Too fast.
[159:31.15]Too fast.
[159:31.57]Too fast.
[159:31.99]Too fast.
[159:33.07]In between dune buggies.
[159:34.31]Ah, didn't count.
[159:40.59]Didn't count.
[159:41.69]Ah, come on.
[159:44.99]That was pretty good so far.
[159:50.22]That was pretty good.
[159:51.00]Hit the sign.
[159:54.61]Drift right.
[159:57.53]Overtake the dune buggy.
[159:58.41]There's an explosion.
[160:02.79]That's close to explosion.
[160:08.14]Drift right.
[160:12.30]Ring through the gate.
[160:12.98]Take out the motorcycle.
[160:17.52]Hit the dune buggy.
[160:19.44]Hurry.
[160:24.93]Ooh, tight.
[160:25.99]Scrape.
[160:26.29]Use action.
[160:28.03]Scrape the vehicle.
[160:37.99]Oh.
[160:38.09]I'm going to miss it.
[160:40.33]Use action.
[160:45.30]No, not again.
[160:48.19]I don't know where the rest of them are.
[160:51.53]Oh, shit.
[160:58.80]It's so easy just to get thrown off the rails in this game.
[161:03.32]Drift right.
[161:04.72]Overtake the dune buggy.
[161:14.93]Alright, I get that star pretty pretty good each time Take out the motorcycle Oh fuck I forgot alright scrape
[161:47.87]Why is that stupid thing there?
[161:50.17]The bus is just in the fucking way.
[161:52.23]Why is the bus there?
[161:53.97]What the hell do you have a bus there for?
[161:55.41]It's just in the way.
[162:06.46]I think it's not good enough.
[162:11.52]No.
[162:11.86]No, no, no, no.
[162:12.36]No more twos.
[162:12.97]I'm not doing it.
[162:15.75]Not good enough.
[162:16.23]It's gotta be this way.
[162:28.37]It's that part with the bus.
[162:29.27]Do I have to go around the bus?
[162:31.06]Because I can't go through it.
[162:33.16]Drift right.
[162:36.34]Overtake the dune buggy.
[162:41.68]Pass close to explosions.
[162:45.23]Same deal.
[162:54.85]Is he going just too damn fast?
[163:05.52]It's too fast!
[163:08.18]You go out of control!
[163:09.54]Use nitrous!
[163:21.20]Stop using nitrous.
[163:22.48]Oh, you're going 180?
[163:23.40]That's alright, you'll figure it out.
[163:43.49]I'm so mad right now.
[163:50.00]That one guy on the bike, he goes so far to the left.
[163:52.80]Drift right.
[163:54.30]Overtake the dune buggy.
[163:57.68]Pass close to explosions.
[164:03.00]Drift right.
[164:11.14]Break through the gate.
[164:11.64]Take out the motorcycle.
[164:17.64]Okay, let's go Whatever
[164:56.04]Give him a chance to land.
[164:58.36]Three!
[164:59.32]Yes!
[164:59.82]I'll take it.
[165:01.60]He killed me in the air.
[165:03.74]That was horrible.
[165:08.66]Let's see it.
[165:19.19]You go too fast, too slow, too fast, too slow.
[165:21.35]When you go too fast, something like that happens.
[165:31.37]I missed this guy, I think.
[165:32.37]I don't think I hit him.
[165:33.97]No, no, yes I do.
[165:38.97]The motorcycle.
[165:39.51]Was the motorcycle on top of my car?
[165:55.69]Yeah, that's the guy I missed.
[165:56.71]I missed him twice.
[166:11.33]I tried to swipe and tried to swipe and then I just took it all out on his friend, apparently.
[166:17.43]Final scene, here we go.
[166:21.42]Final conflict.
[166:24.98]Alright kid, this next scene calls for another difficult stunt you haven't tried before, so let's get you ready.
[166:30.45]It's called the pipe ramp jump, and it uses a specially modified ramp to throw your car into a barrel roll.
[166:36.81]To perform the jump, line your passenger side wheels to hit the raised side of the ramp.
[166:41.85]That's what'll cause your vehicle to roll.
[166:43.87]It's important to hit the ramp fast so you get a high altitude.
[166:47.59]That'll give you enough time for a good full rotation.
[166:50.85]Hit the ramp slow and you're guaranteed to mess up.
[166:53.77]I do this in the parking lot all the time.
[166:55.11]Oh, I see what you guys are doing here.
[166:56.37]You just say that for every single stunt.
[167:22.47]So it's gonna do it just do a roll Yeah, that's pretty self-explanatory Yeah, I got it After your airborne you'll smash through a watchtower mid spin when you land veered to the left and get back on the main road and continue the run I
[167:52.71]That's it?
[167:52.99]That's all you have to explain?
[167:57.15]It's great that they do all this, but then there's 20 or 30 other stunts in the middle of this whole thing that he doesn't even talk about.
[168:07.94]It's a secret.
[168:08.40]325,000, that's a pretty big score.
[168:30.70]It'll never get old.
[168:33.03]It really won't.
[168:37.93]Really?
[168:39.27]I actually did that by a hair.
[168:56.54]Hurry up!
[168:57.42]U-turn again!
[169:06.48]Uh-oh, uh-oh, not fast enough.
[169:08.46]No, it was.
[169:16.48]Dune?
[169:17.00]Ugh!
[169:17.96]Did I get it?
[169:19.38]Smash the pipe!
[169:30.38]Not bad.
[169:39.39]That was as good as you could do.
[169:40.63]Is that it?
[169:56.82]Oh, perfect.
[169:57.84]Is that not five stars?
[170:03.50]That's three stars.
[170:12.63]I had like a x20 or x30, didn't I?
[170:23.05]Why don't we take a look?
[170:29.54]First try.
[170:29.98]This is the first time I've done a first try.
[170:33.94]Felt pretty good.
[170:41.33]Felt pretty good.
[170:47.78]That was way more impressive than just going through it.
[170:49.98]Landing on it and then driving off of it.
[171:19.12]That guy went flying.
[171:26.41]That guy wasn't even looking.
[171:29.73]The guy forgot to say, and go!
[171:31.75]Start firing!
[171:33.36]Be part of the scene, man!
[171:35.50]They didn't even know I was coming.
[171:49.96]That was really good.
[171:57.91]I'll take it.
[171:58.33]Alright, here comes the trailer.
[172:14.27]When the fate of the world hangs in the balance,
[172:17.97]Who will answer the call?
[172:27.31]We come in peace.
[172:29.33]Blazing a trail of justice in a land of corruption.
[172:35.01]Fighting terrorists at the foreign corners of the globe.
[172:40.89]Bring me the weapons or I kill the hostages.
[172:48.54]When a helpless nation has nowhere else to turn.
[172:52.34]If those nukes reach American soil, we'll all be blown.
[172:56.46]They are their only hope.
[172:58.96]See you in hell.
[173:02.82]The guy that narrates the movies in the movies?
[173:04.74]Send me a postcard, scumbag.
[173:07.14]Negotiations.
[173:25.45]That was the second time somebody went through the glass.
[173:27.87]Oh, there you go.
[173:40.98]Coming up next is... What do we have here?
[173:44.67]Some odd jobs.
[173:45.59]Armorall.
[173:46.21]Let's do the Armorall commercial.
[173:53.14]This is an Armor All commercial on the set of Overdrive.
[173:56.18]You'll drive a modern muscle car as it's covered in grime.
[173:59.60]Then it gets instantly cleaned by jumping through three Armor All trailers.
[174:04.08]After the cleaning treatments, your car gains the power of Armor All and you'll plow through a series of vans.
[174:10.26]Wait, why?
[174:11.86]That'll send them flying as soon as you hit them.
[174:14.00]This one should be a lot of fun.
[174:15.82]No, after your car is nice and clean, drive into other cars.
[174:20.41]Armor All.
[174:28.32]That doesn't sound like something I should be doing.
[174:29.86]3, 2, 1, action.
[174:32.96]Turn left.
[174:38.31]Hit the jump.
[174:41.79]Turn left.
[174:43.81]Scrape the vehicle.
[174:47.75]Cod, you're out of the shot.
[174:52.00]It's a metaphor.
[174:52.78]I get it.
[174:53.90]3, 2, 1, action.
[175:01.59]It's just a metaphor.
[175:03.35]What?
[175:03.75]How?
[175:25.60]I remember getting very distraught over this mission as a kid.
[175:30.46]There's a lot of hard turns.
[175:33.04]There's a lot of left, left, left, left, left, scrape.
[175:49.36]No.
[175:53.84]More drifting.
[175:54.36]Okay, I got it.
[176:00.79]Three, two, one, action.
[176:05.23]It's all about the drift.
[176:07.15]Turn left.
[176:09.37]Hit the jump.
[176:10.25]That was alright.
[176:12.40]Turn left.
[176:13.56]Scrape the vehicle.
[176:16.32]Ooh, I still got it.
[176:18.78]That was a pretty cool stunt.
[176:20.68]Turn right.
[176:27.64]Turn left.
[176:27.98]Path under.
[176:34.11]This one's tough.
[176:38.55]Yeah, you do kind of have to nail it.
[177:03.77]It's that scrape that's hard to get.
[177:14.18]Come on, watch out.
[177:20.80]It's a big drift here.
[177:25.31]All the way around.
[177:28.63]What, that was another drift through there?
[177:31.62]I really felt like it did that.
[177:32.80]I don't know.
[177:35.03]I was drifting into it.
[177:36.01]Three, two, one, action.
[177:42.43]Drift turn left.
[177:44.87]Three, two, one, action.
[177:47.73]Too slow.
[177:48.19]That was too fast.
[177:49.35]Drift turn left.
[177:52.87]Hit the jump.
[178:00.31]It's OK.
[178:02.21]In, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in.
[178:03.33]I don't care.
[178:03.63]Turn right.
[178:03.97]Drift left.
[178:04.21]Pass under.
[178:04.61]Turn right.
[178:06.23]Jump through the gap.
[178:22.31]I can't.
[178:22.61]Well, I need to see what's in front of me.
[178:26.48]What are you talking about?
[178:29.85]So, it's 1-2-3.
[178:41.16]Save the slow-mo for the replay.
[178:42.34]You don't have to show me from the cameraman's perspective.
[178:44.76]I'm going to save it from my perspective.
[179:01.16]That one's gonna get me every time.
[179:11.09]Damn it!
[179:15.47]This one's got me.
[179:16.73]This one's got me.
[179:19.41]It does.
[179:19.79]It's got me.
[179:21.31]Hit the jump.
[179:23.41]Turn left.
[179:27.91]Scrape the vehicle.
[179:31.24]That's better.
[179:32.40]Alright, we got it.
[179:43.25]Is it turn?
[179:56.50]Shit!
[179:57.48]One more.
[180:04.95]What strike the truck I thought I had to jump oh no Strike the truck I was so focused on doing all this.
[180:24.76]I forgot that it's part two Sorry
[180:33.85]Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.
[180:37.03]I'm losing it.
[180:50.78]The flask was so much cleaner, too.
[180:52.89]It's not ever good.
[181:05.15]Alright, here we go.
[181:06.44]Strike the truck.
[181:07.92]Strike the truck.
[181:11.34]Strike the truck.
[181:13.16]Hit the truck.
[181:19.07]Cut.
[181:19.43]3, 2, 1, action.
[181:22.19]Turn left.
[181:25.61]I'm like a little upset right now.
[181:32.81]Strike the truck.
[181:34.35]Scrape the truck.
[181:37.62]Don't strike it.
[181:38.44]Armor off.
[181:38.98]Scrape it.
[181:40.24]Be gentle.
[181:40.90]Scrape the side of the truck.
[181:45.08]Moron.
[181:52.80]Out of my way.
[182:00.15]I want that guy fired on the 7.
[182:01.35]That guy'll never work another day again in Hollywood.
[182:05.21]Need to go to that person.
[182:21.82]Get him!
[182:23.08]That's...
[182:26.83]I have to slide into that fucking guy.
[182:29.73]And I don't even know when he comes out.
[182:32.89]Pain in the ass.
[182:51.00]Strike the truck.
[182:51.68]Strike the truck.
[182:52.30]Strike the truck.
[182:52.90]Strike the truck.
[182:53.50]Strike the truck.
[183:15.48]That's bullshit.
[183:17.24]Unbelievable.
[183:18.60]You've got to be kidding me.
[183:21.58]There's no... I can't even believe that happened.
[183:24.88]I have no... It's fine.
[183:29.26]I can't let it bother me.
[183:30.02]I'm not going to let it bother me.
[183:33.63]I get it.
[183:35.63]Ugh.
[183:52.54]Turn left.
[183:53.52]Straighten the vehicle.
[183:57.24]Hit the boxes.
[183:58.72]Very clean.
[183:59.94]Turn right.
[184:01.92]Very.
[184:02.86]Drift left.
[184:04.00]Pass under.
[184:26.87]I think I timed this shit.
[185:01.35]Strike.
[185:08.68]Strike.
[185:10.00]Strike the truck.
[185:12.66]Strike the truck.
[185:17.54]Hit the truck.
[185:19.16]Which one?
[185:21.92]Throw 180.
[185:24.28]OK, I did it.
[185:30.62]A good day's work.
[185:32.02]Let's strike the set and get out of here.
[185:34.64]There were a lot of trucks to pick from there.
[185:40.82]304.
[185:48.09]These commercial ones are much harder than the base game.
[185:51.75]Let's see the replay.
[186:17.01]Sometimes it just seems like the elements are out to get your car.
[186:20.59]That's why there's armor Tire shines for the wheels wash and wax of the exterior and protect and wipes the inside They'll give your car that armor all protection to make sure it looks its best and stays that way Oh
[186:43.52]Go ahead Stare Go ahead Stare I love this
[187:11.57]That was definitely one of the employees of this game company.
[187:17.51]So if you have like a 29 to 31 second spot, definitely make sure that you have a 29 to 30 second voiceover line.
[187:27.57]That was 11 seconds of dialogue.
[187:30.87]Or just make it a 15 second commercial.
[187:35.93]You can't get some marketing guy to write an extra few lines.
[187:41.03]Waited way too long.
[187:41.81]Alright, there's one more here.
[187:44.80]I feel like this is gonna be very hard.
[187:49.63]In this show, you'll be driving the Clawdeen over a frozen track.
[187:53.19]The line itself is straightforward, but the ice will make it very difficult to execute, especially since you're not allowed to make any mistakes.
[188:00.79]Navigate through the course, crashing through each crate and passing under the semis.
[188:05.33]The trick is knowing how to control your drifts on the ice.
[188:08.87]And keep your eye out for those under-the-semi stunts.
[188:11.80]They'll be tough marks to hit.
[188:14.55]Now let's bring out a stuntman fresh off the Hollywood sets.
[188:18.49]Watch him slip and slide across the perilous ice while somehow still hitting his marks.
[188:24.47]Let's get that engine started!
[188:27.40]Jump right off the bat.
[188:29.98]This is not that long.
[188:30.82]Only 100,000 points.
[188:31.16]Three, two, one, action.
[188:34.40]He jumps on the trailer, then down to the ice below.
[188:40.44]Oh, our driver has veered off course.
[188:48.26]This is gonna be one that I Probably don't do
[189:17.44]Action!
[189:18.22]He jumps on the trailer, then down to the ice below!
[189:22.66]Can he hit everyone?
[189:23.58]And under the semi?
[189:24.40]He's gotta control this drift!
[189:33.70]Can he make it under the semi?
[189:39.68]Can he hit a strong wing?
[189:42.04]Try that!
[189:48.16]You don't have to go that fast, Sam.
[189:51.22]I can drive with it.
[189:53.48]This one's not long.
[189:54.48]I can do it.
[190:17.09]Action!
[190:17.85]He jumps on the trailer, then down to the ice below!
[190:21.90]Can he hit everyone?
[190:22.86]Can he hit everyone?
[190:24.46]3, 2, 1, action!
[190:26.50]He jumps on the trailer, then down to the ice below!
[190:29.02]Can he hit everyone?
[190:47.79]Nope.
[190:48.71]Nope.
[190:49.13]That's it.
[190:49.83]No, it's not.
[190:50.25]Oh my god.
[190:51.28]I'm going to be stuck here.
[190:52.74]Just slow it down.
[190:54.78]Don't have to go fast.
[191:19.30]My tongue was out of my mouth that whole time.
[191:22.45]Shit.
[191:22.69]I haven't beat it though.
[191:44.15]I have to beat it, I have to.
[191:45.55]I can't not do this.
[191:46.37]I'm gonna turn the voice off.
[191:48.69]I think I have to disable voice for this.
[192:24.72]Holy fuck!
[192:25.82]Hey!
[192:30.20]Don't go out of bounds!
[192:31.52]It's the ice, holy god!
[192:33.28]Oh, that sucks.
[192:37.56]That really sucks.
[192:41.48]Going through that second semi, you gotta go fast enough and then there's the ice right there, you gotta... I give up.
[193:08.56]What the fuck?
[193:16.99]You got to go really fast through that last spring.
[193:21.06]You have to lead that target, too.
[193:24.38]I have to drive in a straight line, like 200 feet in front of that semi.
[193:28.01]Alright, I can do it.
[193:35.93]Excuse me?
[193:55.38]control this trip
[194:26.34]He jumps on the trailer, then down to the ice below.
[194:31.30]Can he hit everyone?
[194:39.36]He didn't go fast enough.
[194:40.72]3, 2, 1, action.
[194:45.95]I can't even get to the first one anymore.
[194:47.57]Can he hit everyone?
[195:00.57]God, that's insane.
[195:06.53]That's insanity.
[195:10.26]You just got to get lucky to do this one.
[195:11.74]3, 2, 1, action.
[195:12.82]He jumps on the trailer, then down to the ice below.
[195:16.44]I'll do it after another 200 attempts.
[195:17.66]Can he hit everyone?
[195:23.64]3, 2, 1, action.
[195:25.77]He jumps on the trailer, then down to the ice below.
[195:30.81]can he hit everyone dot
[196:02.16]Here we go.
[196:17.15]I can see it in chat and it's fucking messing me up.
[196:22.87]Stop spamming!
[196:23.85]It hurts my eyes!
[196:32.76]That's bullshit.
[196:33.44]I fucking drifted.
[196:58.30]I can't.
[196:58.92]I'm going to have a fucking meltdown from this one.
[197:03.41]You wanted a Meltdown?
[197:05.49]You might get one soon.
[197:07.84]I don't know how much longer I can handle this, as a human.
[197:25.93]Oh, please!
[197:46.79]Yeah, he's under the semi!
[197:48.51]He's gotta control this drift!
[197:54.39]I had it too.
[197:54.91]That was the end.
[197:55.47]That's the turnaround.
[198:02.54]And what a good break from playing the regular game to do like this hard bullshit levels.
[198:08.71]This ain't even a commercial.
[198:18.11]I'm drifting in there.
[198:19.06]I am.
[198:20.46]How do you expect somebody to do that?
[198:23.34]This... I'm drifting.
[198:24.92]And if I drift too much, I just fly out of the goddamn playing area.
[198:34.46]What are you on about, game?
[198:36.64]How do you expect me to do that?
[198:50.69]Oh my god!
[198:51.97]Oh my god!
[198:52.93]You see what I'm saying?
[198:55.07]You see what I'm talking about, right?
[198:57.65]You understand?
[199:01.90]You get it.
[199:02.42]You guys get me.
[199:03.28]You do.
[199:03.60]You get me.
[199:12.30]I know you guys always got my back.
[199:27.09]Motherfucker.
[199:34.07]I love just looking over here and just seeing everybody's got my back here.
[199:49.30]This music playing over and over again too is not helping.
[200:17.09]Hey, what?
[200:21.24]That's... I turned it off.
[200:47.83]Alright.
[201:53.57]Why?
[202:26.73]It's so hard.
[202:27.79]I gotta get it.
[202:29.15]I will.
[202:29.95]Eventually, it'll happen.
[202:35.56]Didn't even give me the...
[203:33.82]It's actually impossible.
[203:35.30]It's impossible to do that.
[203:36.40]It's not possible to do that last semi.
[203:40.04]I don't think it is.
[203:40.66]I think this is a developer joke.
[203:46.29]That's a developer joke.
[203:51.85]Because you have to drift out of that and then you can't straighten up.
[203:56.90]There's no way.
[203:57.62]It's not possible.
[203:59.24]It's a fucking developer joke.
[204:05.75]I'm going to try this one more.
[204:10.55]I get further the quieter this frame.
[204:12.17]Then under the semi.
[204:35.09]He's very close.
[204:42.69]Three, two, one, action.
[204:45.91]He jumps on the trailer, then down to the ice below.
[204:50.96]Can he hit everyone?
[204:58.18]Then under the semi.
[205:01.36]Three, two, one, action.
[205:04.58]He jumps on the trailer, then down to the ice below.
[205:09.56]Can he hit everyone?
[205:16.73]Then under the semi, he's got... Three, two, one, action.
[205:23.69]He jumps on the trailer, then down to the ice below.
[205:28.63]Can he hit everyone?
[205:35.30]And under the semi, he's gotta control this drift.
[205:38.76]Can he make it under the semi?
[205:41.67]Can he hit every- One.
[205:50.39]Two.
[205:51.36]One.
[205:52.12]Action.
[205:52.86]He jumps on the trailer, then down to the ice below.
[205:57.88]Can he hit everyone?
[206:04.68]Then under the semi, he's gotta control this drift.
[206:07.92]Can he make it under the semi?
[206:11.34]Can he hit everyone?
[206:15.44]Under another semi!
[206:17.39]Watch this one!
[206:20.21]Didn't quite make it.
[206:26.99]Three, two, one, action.
[206:30.21]He jumps on the trailer, then down to the ice below.
[206:35.16]Can he hit everyone?
[206:42.04]Then under the semi, he's got to control this drift.
[206:45.13]Can he make it under the semi?
[206:50.33]Can he hit?
[206:50.93]3, 2, 1, action.
[206:54.13]I'm going to lose my mind.
[206:55.69]I'm so glad it's muted.
[206:57.06]Then down to the ice below.
[207:01.02]Can he hit everyone?
[207:07.75]Then under the semi, he's gotta control this drift.

[207:18.51]Under another semi?
[207:21.31]Three, two, one, action.
[207:24.51]He jumps on the trailer, then down to the ice below.
[207:29.62]Can he hit everyone?
[207:36.88]I can't, I can't change the language.
[207:41.47]Change the language.
[207:47.31]Hit everyone!
[207:50.84]Three, two, one, action!
[207:54.04]He jumps on the trailer, then down to the ice below!

[208:41.17]Under another semi!
[208:43.11]Watch this 180!
[208:49.65]I did it.
[208:50.69]I did it.
[208:51.87]I can't believe it.
[208:52.63]Okay.
[208:53.93]Hey, welcome to Stuntman Ignition.
[208:55.71]How do you like that, folks?
[208:57.22]Let's hear it for that inconceivable, unbelievable performance.
[209:00.98]Inconceivable, unbelievable, irreplaceable, irredeemable.
[209:07.84]Spencer, thanks for the five community subs.
[209:09.74]Thanks for the five subs.
[209:12.41]I'm cool.
[209:13.51]I'm normal.
[209:14.39]I'm fine.
[209:15.51]I'm just a normal streamer.
[209:17.09]Hey, welcome to the stream.
[209:21.51]Thank you.
[209:21.91]But no, it's just thanks for the five subs, Spencer.
[209:23.62]Welcome.
[209:25.30]Only four stars.
[209:26.14]I ain't doing that shit again.
[209:29.28]No way.
[209:32.43]I did get a five-star replay.
[209:34.39]So let me actually... I can't even... There's no sound.
[209:38.39]I can't change it.
[209:42.69]Creamcorn, thanks for the five subs.
[209:44.25]Enjoy this soundless replay.
[210:14.03]I can feel it.
[210:14.77]Imagine missing that turn.
[210:17.64]The 180 at the end.
[210:20.04]I was just barely... Almost out of the range there.
[210:24.68]That would have been terrible.
[210:25.66]I would have been so mad.
[210:26.70]Alright, well that's all we can do now.
[210:29.14]Let's go back to the other game.
[210:34.69]There is one more odd job.
[210:36.87]It looks like there's two or three other...
[210:42.34]I think I'm just going to beat this game.
[210:43.72]I'm just going to beat the game tonight.
[210:45.62]I think that's what's going to happen.
[210:46.40]Alright, I need to turn the voice back on.
[210:52.99]No, no, no.
[210:53.57]Not the voice.
[210:54.15]What was it?
[210:59.00]60?
[210:59.04]Everything at 60?
[211:02.46]Put the music at like fucking 40.
[211:08.02]60, 60, 60, 50, music at 40.
[211:11.80]Alright.
[211:14.70]That's fine.
[211:15.84]Music's definitely enough.
[211:16.78]Music's kind of annoying.
[211:22.83]Music and replay only.
[211:25.61]Voice 100.
[211:26.03]No.
[211:26.33]Now here we go.
[211:33.33]Overdrive.
[211:34.11]This looks like an ambulance one, or a firefighter one.
[211:38.61]Hey, how's it going, kid?
[211:39.69]I'm the director of Overdrive, Robert Rodino, okay?
[211:41.70]Overdrive is a street crime movie set in today's San Francisco, okay?
[211:45.28]It's one of those throwback movies to the 70s exploitation films.
[211:48.54]Bombs, car chases, afros, hot chicks, windsurfing, space shuttle, okay?
[211:53.79]You kind of get where I'm going with this?
[211:55.23]We're going to go big with this one.
[211:56.41]We might as well even just call the movie Super Big and Awesome, but it's not going to fit on a poster, okay?
[212:01.21]Alright, you're going to be doubling for our hero Stone, okay?
[212:03.95]Alright, now I want your guy to be tough, but not leather tough.
[212:06.52]That sounds like the Smash Mouth lead singer.
[212:36.62]Cool.
[212:36.84]Nice.
[212:37.08]Ooh, I like that one.
[213:05.79]The film's set in San Francisco, with lots of steep hills and tight alleyways.
[213:10.71]Rodina was known for pushing the envelope in his action scenes, so you'll have your hands full with some complicated lines, including a great scene on a cargo ship, and a massive jump from a parking garage roof that ends with you smashing into a helicopter.
[213:24.30]Excited yet?
[213:25.42]Come on, let's get to work.
[213:28.02]Why do I know what you mean when you say that?
[213:29.62]You said this guy sounds like he's speaking from his chest.
[213:44.38]Then turn left, plow through the gas station, and hit the semi.
[213:48.13]You don't want this crash to stop you, so make sure to aim for the back end of the trailer, not the middle.
[213:54.07]That way you'll turn the trailer and keep barreling forward.
[213:57.25]It's like a lung voice.
[213:58.17]It is very deep and powerful.
[214:11.22]Alright, here we go.
[214:23.03]This is hard turn.
[214:27.17]Oh yeah, I smashed it!
[214:31.71]I smashed into that.
[214:33.71]That was a smash.
[214:34.79]A full smash.
[214:36.22]Oh.
[214:36.64]This is what we call dumb?
[214:41.35]I scratched it.
[214:42.17]It's too loud.
[214:44.62]I told you I was supposed to not have it this loud.
[214:49.10]Hit the dumpster.
[214:57.82]Smash the car.
[215:00.20]Hit the semi.
[215:05.35]No.
[215:06.89]3, 2, 1.
[215:08.87]Action.
[215:09.47]Hit the trolley.
[215:13.58]This is like going from Toad to Bowser.
[215:19.43]I play with Toad and Koopa.
[215:24.81]I don't play with Donkey Kong, I don't play with Bowser, and this is why.
[215:31.41]I have like 2000 hours in Mario Kart.
[215:35.30]And now you make me play fucking Donkey Kong.
[215:49.38]Good.
[215:50.44]How is that not a drift?
[215:54.28]Motherfucker!
[215:59.01]Don't get angry.
[216:02.57]Slow down.
[216:03.69]Don't say the F word again.
[216:20.32]It's too far away What how am I getting X's in the police cars
[216:54.09]What?
[216:54.73]I just got destroyed.
[217:06.17]I want to see that again.
[217:07.79]I need to see.
[217:13.24]This is just GTA.
[217:15.26]It really is.
[217:15.78]It's just, oh, I took a fire ambulance.
[217:18.56]Look at me!
[217:20.99]I'm just gonna hold down R2.
[217:22.45]Whoop-de-doo.
[217:26.17]Excuse me.
[217:28.39]Do you think I'm funny?
[217:29.61]I've got it.
[217:30.23]I'm gonna spray you.
[217:32.27]I'm gonna spray you with the thing.
[217:46.20]So what?
[217:46.59]I don't know.
[217:47.53]I drove close to it.
[217:48.47]Why?
[217:48.65]Did I get too close?
[217:52.06]I don't know.
[217:53.68]Three, two, one, action.
[217:59.22]Hit the trolley.
[218:10.92]How do you miss the dumpster?
[218:11.86]You're as big as the hallway.
[218:14.17]You're as big as that... I'm as big as that thing is tall.
[218:19.01]There's no... Why?
[218:20.57]You know what I'm saying.
[218:21.33]How is that even possible?
[218:25.29]Drip turn left.
[218:42.40]Good.
[218:44.16]Scrape it!
[218:46.01]I didn't... Oh, I thought pillar.
[218:52.33]That's a scrape.
[218:53.93]How does that not count as a scrape?
[219:01.05]Good.
[219:04.33]Pretty decent.
[219:05.47]Not as good as it was in my head or on paper, but hey.
[219:10.95]That's the end of the... Oh shit, that's the end of the mission.
[219:14.71]I'm dumb.
[219:33.00]I thought I screwed something up.
[219:47.71]This just makes me want to play GTA V and just drive around in the firetruck.
[220:03.56]Whenever I do the casino stream, my car of choice will be the firetruck.
[220:17.55]so
[220:22.15]Notorious.
[220:22.85]Alright, here's the muscle car.
[220:24.89]Dude, there's a warm smell coming off of my body.
[220:52.99]I just, I smell like heat.
[220:55.43]I don't smell bad.
[220:56.09]I don't, I'm not like, don't smell bad.
[220:58.51]I smell like warm, like heat.
[221:01.43]My body is just emanating.
[221:03.47]Just fire.
[221:05.21]425,000.
[221:08.57]Hold on, itchy nose.
[221:20.04]3, 2, 1, action.
[221:21.20]Follow the lead vehicle.
[221:24.82]Turn right.
[221:28.24]Jump through the crates.
[221:29.22]Hard left.
[221:32.02]Into the alley.
[221:34.72]Catch up to the lead vehicle.
[221:42.62]You're going the wrong way.
[221:45.28]You stopped me.
[221:49.18]One.
[221:49.94]Action.
[221:51.06]Follow the lead vehicle.
[221:53.09]Turn right.
[221:56.03]Jump through the crates.
[221:59.65]Hard left.
[222:00.49]Into the alley.
[222:01.61]Hard right.
[222:04.24]I thought I was supposed to follow him.
[222:09.16]These little alley turns are not going to be good.
[222:11.82]Hard right.
[222:17.35]Hard left.
[222:19.73]I just knocked it out of his hands.
[222:29.89]Move!
[222:31.10]Where's the horn?
[222:59.29]No, change it back.
[223:00.09]There we go.
[223:05.93]Through the gap.
[223:09.14]Hard right.
[223:25.05]Got it.
[223:27.15]Why did you crash?
[223:37.32]That guy did not need to crash.
[223:44.32]He just drove into the fucking pole.
[223:55.25]There was no chaos.
[223:56.23]There was no problem.
[223:57.20]There was no... I didn't... I wasn't creeping up on him.
[224:00.28]He just did that.
[224:00.96]I was on him.
[224:02.58]Jump through the crates.
[224:08.66]Catch up to the lead vehicle.
[224:11.57]Hard left.
[224:12.25]Into the alley.
[224:12.75]Hard right.
[224:26.11]I'm still making up time.
[224:27.09]Overtake the car.
[224:31.45]What a bad angle that is.
[224:32.81]What a bad camera angle.
[224:39.03]Overtake the trolley.
[224:41.31]I got there before you did.
[224:42.67]Oh, I'm gonna... I got there before you... Like, where's your cue?
[224:49.89]I got there before you... It's alright.
[224:53.04]Jump through the crates.
[225:00.42]That's got so many points, for what?
[225:11.35]Yes, I know, I'm arguing with the video here.
[225:19.34]My mother used to go into my- fuck that.
[225:23.58]my mother used to come into my bedroom and just ask me who I was talking to because I'd be like this is ridiculous I can't even understand it like I would be having a full conversation you did it again motherfucker three two one action follow the lead vehicle turn right honey who are you talking to huh no nothing nobody hard left into the alley hard right

[225:59.80]Through the gap.
[226:00.22]Hard right.
[226:05.18]Hard left.
[226:06.70]You seem to be having a full conversation.
[226:11.21]Drip turn left.
[226:17.41]Overtake the trolley.
[226:22.91]He did it again.
[226:25.68]Close scuttle.
[226:27.02]Catch up to the lead vehicle.
[226:28.11]Into the warehouse.
[226:28.81]You dumb fucking truck.
[226:31.67]You ruined it.
[226:33.41]You ruined it.
[226:34.97]I didn't do anything.
[226:36.17]I just was trying to get through.
[226:37.61]Jump through the crates.
[226:44.48]Jump off the ship.
[226:47.84]Cut!
[226:48.44]That was not a good place to go.
[226:50.45]Rescue team!
[226:54.43]He told me to jump off the ship.
[226:59.47]Sorry, I didn't say Simon Says.
[227:04.72]You lose, Jeremy.
[227:22.87]One off this time.
[227:25.16]One off this time.
[227:28.74]That was good.
[227:29.78]That's a good one.
[227:30.34]Wow.
[227:58.09]I got it still.
[227:58.81]Okay.
[228:00.47]Now you want me to turn this way.
[228:06.04]Hard left.
[228:06.72]Scrape the SUV.
[228:08.24]Oh, come on.
[228:09.40]That was no way I was going to do that.
[228:10.72]Pass close to the car.
[228:11.36]Turn left.
[228:13.46]The car that was there for a tenth of a second and then exploded.
[228:18.81]Use action.
[228:24.53]Use action.
[228:27.38]Catch up to the lead vehicle.
[228:29.80]Jump the car crash.
[228:33.46]Roll 180.
[228:34.02]God, pretty decent.
[228:39.54]Not as good as what I had in my head, but hey, few things are.
[228:43.13]Except those movies with the monkeys and they fight and they truck.
[228:46.71]They're truck-driving monkey movies.
[228:47.93]You guys see those?
[228:49.11]God, that's good acting.
[228:52.73]It's gonna be two stars.
[228:54.89]Three?
[228:56.23]I'll take it.
[229:05.40]Don't skip it.
[229:39.59]Great car chase?
[229:40.53]I don't think we've seen the other car.
[229:42.77]Oh, there it is.
[229:46.33]I thought that was me.
[229:57.30]I was like, did I do that?
[229:59.34]It's happened so frequently that I just assumed that that was me.
[230:17.69]Pass that guy, by the way.
[230:18.78]Pass that guy on the right.
[230:21.46]Go around him.
[230:23.18]Just go around him.
[230:23.98]Why can't you do that?
[230:28.05]Why don't you have an 11 millisecond response time?
[230:46.65]Two stars is unacceptable.
[230:49.21]Three to four is good.
[230:50.39]Is this the bike one?
[231:02.18]Yeah, I love the bike ones.
[231:03.68]They're so much fun.
[231:05.09]Now you'll double for Varga on his bike, escaping a sting operation.
[231:09.11]This scene happens right before he hijacks the fire truck in Big Red.
[231:13.03]The challenge here, gap between two cars, move quickly to the ramp, and jump the trolley.
[231:19.18]Aim your landing to overtake the cop after you hit the ground.
[231:22.72]Then, top it off by sliding under the low-flying helicopter.
[231:26.38]This all happens very quickly, so it's gonna be about... Is that gonna take my head off?
[231:32.41]No jiggling boobs or anything like that just drive like you freaking mean it or catering goes home Yeah, that's a really hard left
[232:06.74]Not bad.
[232:09.60]What?
[232:12.28]That was good.
[232:12.90]I couldn't control.
[232:25.71]Damn.
[232:36.47]I kind of want to, hold on, I need to see what happens here.
[232:43.95]Alright, I'm ready.
[232:49.65]It doesn't matter.
[232:59.76]Have fun.
[233:01.66]It doesn't matter.
[233:02.92]It doesn't just kill you.
[233:05.77]Cleaner than that.
[233:07.13]Come on, Jeremy.
[233:07.49]You can do it.
[233:08.21]Nice.
[233:08.57]Trolley through.
[233:09.67]Grab the needle.
[233:37.21]Well, that's... Still got a... In here?
[233:45.29]I don't... Jeez!
[233:49.46]Into the trolley?
[233:54.26]Wheelie?
[233:58.88]Sorry.
[233:59.89]Why am I apologizing?
[234:00.95]I'm sorry, guys.
[234:02.59]Guys...
[234:04.96]Cut me off.
[234:08.26]Sorry.
[234:08.66]Get out of my way.
[234:19.35]I'll get it.
[234:21.53]I got it.
[234:21.91]I can do it.
[234:26.13]Oh shit.
[234:34.83]Where, where's the next part?
[234:37.43]What?
[234:37.81]Ah, I think I'm gonna lose.
[234:47.14]What window?
[234:47.66]Ah.
[235:11.85]This is so stupid.
[235:15.29]Where did it all go so wrong?
[235:18.83]I didn't get hit by that, which I almost did, and then what happened?
[235:23.36]That's- this is fine.
[235:26.12]That was done fine.
[235:32.64]Where does this go so wrong?
[235:33.86]Right there.
[235:35.30]I thought it would have speed.
[236:05.08]He fucking bounced.
[236:12.19]Oh, I'm sorry.
[236:17.85]Screaming is too much.
[236:25.46]But really though, how are you supposed to go up there?
[236:41.52]Go through the window, and the jump leads you right into the wall.
[236:47.92]OK.
[236:48.94]Oh, hold on.
[236:53.92]Three, two, one.
[236:54.62]OK, I'm going to try this again.
[236:56.34]Action.
[236:57.52]Through the gap.
[237:00.27]Hard left.
[237:01.93]Drift left.
[237:04.49]Fast pull up to the trolley.
[237:07.27]Pull up to the trolley.
[237:08.59]I got you.
[237:09.23]Through the gap.
[237:12.59]Over the trolley.
[237:14.81]Over the trolley.
[237:15.65]Come on.
[237:15.93]Does that count?
[237:16.91]It's alright.
[237:21.01]I can still get three stars.
[237:32.28]Good.
[237:33.38]Wheelie.
[237:33.76]Did I get it?
[237:43.90]I didn't know I had to do that.
[237:45.16]Did it!
[237:54.32]What window?
[238:15.74]I have to move on.
[238:19.32]I have to get out of here before I die.
[238:26.37]That slumping back into the seat.
[238:31.65]Because you're getting an accident.
[238:34.61]And the accident doesn't make you fall off the bike.
[238:36.74]Just delayed reaction a few seconds later, you fall backwards.
[238:40.28]You just pass out from the extreme stress of the situation.
[238:53.87]Like, you can't believe you're still alive.
[238:55.81]And you faint.
[239:01.57]I didn't get it.
[239:02.17]I landed that on the back tire, though.
[239:09.12]Where's the panic to try to do the objective?
[239:11.44]It's coming up here.
[239:13.50]Go through the trolleys!
[239:14.38]Oh shit, I'm gonna just hurt myself to do this.
[239:19.42]Here it comes.
[239:34.79]What was that?
[239:38.41]I made it through though.
[239:39.29]I may have like skinned my whole body, but I made it through.
[239:47.43]I hope that makes it into the trailer.
[239:49.85]Please, have one of those make it into the trailer.
[240:04.61]You know this AI, the algorithm here, is gonna pull a random scene where something like that happens.
[240:11.09]And it's gonna be so funny.
[240:13.64]In this scene, you'll play Stone again as he's ambushed by SUV driving hit squads.
[240:18.38]The feature stunt will be a reverse 180 getaway.
[240:21.43]You'll turn into a narrow alley, then two SUVs will block your path.
[240:25.73]Slam on the brakes and reverse back the way you came.
[240:28.23]As you enter the main street, spin the car all the way around so you can drive forward into the next alley and escape your pursuers.
[240:35.30]You know what Rodino said about making Stone tough.
[240:37.80]This is your last shot to give him some balls.
[240:43.18]The trailers are pre-rendered.
[240:44.18]A million points.
[240:45.00]This is the real deal.
[240:45.80]What?
[241:14.43]Oh, I thought I had to turn right.
[241:15.53]Apparently not.
[241:20.88]Drip turn right.
[241:24.58]3, 2, 1, action.
[241:27.08]Pass close to explosions.
[241:29.22]All the way to the left.
[241:32.48]Drip turn right.
[241:34.24]Right through the glass.
[241:35.20]What?
[241:35.44]3, 2, 1, action.
[241:38.78]Pass close to explosions.
[241:50.19]Close to the explosion.
[241:54.93]Smash out of the convention center.
[241:57.05]Pass close to the SUV.
[241:57.79]I got it.
[242:00.51]Yep.
[242:00.73]Drip turn right.
[242:02.80]Pass close to weapons fire.
[242:04.30]Through the gap.
[242:05.46]Through the gap?
[242:07.50]Close to the explosion.
[242:09.28]Turn right.
[242:10.56]Pass close to the car.
[242:12.58]Into the alley.
[242:14.27]Stop and reverse.
[242:22.94]I did it.
[242:26.47]Nope, not happening.
[242:28.95]Not happening.
[242:43.86]Did I go too high?
[242:58.98]No, he knocked me over.
[243:08.47]Action.
[243:08.77]What does it do?
[243:14.09]That's not bad.
[243:26.42]Oh.
[243:27.66]Did you see what happened to that guy?
[243:28.97]Watch this replay.
[243:32.67]The first car in that explosion.
[243:34.71]Let's see if we get a good view of it.
[243:37.71]There can't be a human in there.
[243:39.98]Watch how fast this gets ripped off the screen.
[243:47.18]Come on.
[243:47.96]See you later.
[243:56.07]The beginning wasn't that bad.
[244:08.95]That was bad placement there, RNG placement for where that was gonna land, physics-based.
[244:17.86]What the hell?
[244:18.70]Oh.
[244:22.88]That was good.
[244:48.22]What's the final part of this?
[244:51.30]I can tell I wanted to go right there, but yeah, there.
[245:03.16]I'll take that over the original.
[245:05.40]I should get some style points there.
[245:25.83]Three, three, three.
[245:26.93]This is called snitch.
[245:29.69]This scene happens at the start of the movie when Stone chases down a bike punk who's hopped up on Varga's new drug.
[245:35.92]You'll double for the punk.
[245:37.54]The key to this run is another well-timed slide.
[245:40.64]After a hard drift right, you'll accelerate up a steep street and pass close to a police car.
[245:46.41]Then you'll slide to dodge beneath another cop car as it comes over the hill and flies straight toward you.
[245:52.29]The vehicle could take your head off, so be careful and make sure you slide on cue.
[245:56.03]Trying to do that though.
[245:58.00]I can't whistle well.
[246:01.29]This one sounds hard Which one?
[246:03.47]Oh shit
[246:30.89]one action pass close to the cop car hey
[246:59.82]Oh, well.
[247:02.57]I didn't even, like, see it.
[247:05.33]Alright.
[247:09.17]I don't... Okay.
[247:27.56]Pass close to the cop car.
[247:28.78]I thought that was pretty close.
[247:32.32]Use action.
[247:36.46]Drift turn right.
[247:37.19]There you go.
[247:41.07]You good?
[247:41.45]Use action.
[247:45.13]Drift turn right.
[247:45.69]Where's the drift?
[247:46.67]Pass close to the cop car.
[247:48.59]It's okay.
[247:48.97]You gotta go.
[247:49.68]You gotta hug the left side there.
[247:52.18]Action.
[247:53.78]Pass close to the cop car.
[248:07.82]Left.
[248:09.40]On the left.
[248:15.01]Good.
[248:20.71]That physics made no sense there.
[248:28.67]Gotta go around it.
[248:31.21]The person's still in there.
[248:32.53]What?
[248:48.93]What?
[248:49.41]How did I get four?
[249:13.19]Something tells me that should not have been like that, but I'll take it.
[249:17.91]I fell down like four times.
[249:23.28]I like that view.
[249:53.51]I'll fix it.
[249:58.44]I'll fix it.
[249:59.88]Here we go.
[250:15.11]How is that correct?
[250:17.73]Nothing about that seemed correct.
[250:35.43]Thank you, Gnarly, for the five community subs.
[250:40.55]Came in right there a minute ago.
[250:41.61]Thank you, Gnarly.
[250:42.83]Five subs.
[250:45.18]Bring to the final mission of Overdrive.
[250:47.06]How do I get four on this and not four on this one or this one?
[250:52.02]Alright, this is the super fast call.
[250:55.70]In this scene, you'll play as Stone, who's commandeered Vargas' prized European sports car, the MVX Spartan.
[251:02.73]The major stunt comes at the end.
[251:04.67]You'll shoot across two rooftops, then take a huge jump and smash into a helicopter in mid-flight.
[251:11.01]You'll need to gun it going into your first jump, or you won't have enough speed.
[251:14.99]Make sure you're lined up and throttle it hard the rest of the way.
[251:18.42]Trust me, kid, pull this off and you'll have some serious bragging rights.
[251:22.79]Now when people see this last stunt, I want their heads to explode straight off their heads so NASA calls us up and go, hey, are you guys launching heads?
[251:29.66]Literally explode.
[251:31.08]Now make it happen or I'll deport your family.
[251:35.38]Three, two, one, action.
[251:43.03]Pass on to the semi.
[251:45.97]Let's go.
[251:46.29]First 180.
[251:47.05]Whoa.
[251:50.39]What?
[251:51.55]Now what?
[251:55.72]Now what?
[251:59.84]Ow Holy shit
[252:24.21]Can I get it?
[252:26.43]Shit.
[252:33.36]That ain't gonna happen.
[252:45.40]Give me a break.
[252:54.54]What happened in the beginning here?
[252:56.86]Besides that.
[252:57.48]So it's go back and then do a 180.
[253:02.46]And then what?
[253:02.84]And then turn back around?
[253:23.90]Holy shit, this car's fast.
[253:57.10]This is intense.
[254:00.38]Awww.
[254:17.35]I'm ready.
[254:18.83]Let's do it.
[254:27.07]Pass under the semi.
[254:28.98]I thought I was going to keep going.
[254:34.98]Reverse 180.

[255:14.32]Turn left.
[255:14.84]Close to the explosion.
[255:27.69]Not bad.
[255:30.75]What's next?
[255:34.79]Something stupid and easy.
[255:39.80]I knew it.
[255:50.87]Fuck!
[255:51.33]Hey listen, you're driving the car from the front, right?
[256:00.11]I'm missing this whole thing here.

[257:40.75]Use action!
[257:42.18]I got it!
[257:46.90]Was that the guy in the helicopter or was that me?
[257:51.08]I don't know if that was me or not.
[257:53.48]Did I fall out?
[258:01.73]I can't.
[258:02.39]I'm sorry.
[258:03.47]That's not enough.

[273:41.98]I just, I have, it's so close.

[273:49.95]Just remember, every time you're about to have a meltdown about, like, a 10-year-old video game, just remember you have 33, you know?
[273:55.04]It's, like, not appropriate.
[273:56.42]So, I'm fine.
[273:57.56]Everything's fine.
[273:59.00]You know, I'm, like, I'm in my 30s.
[274:00.36]You know, you're not supposed to do that.
[274:01.46]What, I didn't get the right piece of candy at the candy store?
[274:04.74]Everything's fine.
[274:05.58]I'm a grown man.
[274:07.44]Grown men don't get angry at things like this.
[274:09.87]They worry about, like, taxes and...

[274:38.32]Pass under the semi.
[274:40.26]Reverse 180.
[274:56.10]Drive near- I know you have to drive near cars, but when I- okay, so this taxi right here, right?
[275:02.20]There's an explosion, and then I- I'm driving close to this car!

[275:10.50]Got it!
[275:15.02]Doesn't matter.

[277:12.35]And when the new designer drug, Gristle, hits the streets, the death toll rises daily.
[277:18.58]One man's rage can only boil for so long, till he explodes.
[277:22.86]Varga!
[277:30.92]barbed wire nerves, bloody fists, and a few marbles short, stone will stop at nothing to get Varga off the streets forever.
[277:43.08]It's Loose Cannon versus Loose Cannon.
[277:53.29]Two men stand, one man falls.
[277:58.02]Well, that didn't happen in mine.

[282:59.15]That wasn't that bad, actually.
[283:00.21]That hasn't been okay, right?
[283:03.23]Three, uh... Let's watch it.
[283:22.63]commercial when you need to ship a package in today's chaotic world you have a lot of options but there's only one delivery service that knocks its competitors right off the map only one service with a worldwide network of experienced drivers giving you unmatched customer service speed and reliability no matter what so whether it's raining cats dogs or giant chunks of lava
[283:51.19]I went too fast.
[284:02.02]See, now you had a couple of few too many lines.
[284:04.50]You could have deleted a few of them and tightened it up so you didn't have to overlap.
[284:09.70]Ayayay.
[284:19.10]Okay.
[284:23.12]We have... two more movies to do.
[284:28.06]Never Kill Me Again and Night Avenger.
[284:35.09]What do you say if we get started?
[284:38.13]Bonjour, I am Jean-Benoît Bernard, world-renowned director of Never Kill Me Again.
[284:43.90]This is the 14th spy movie in this series, and you are thinking, oh, how easy.
[284:48.80]We will slop together some explosions, and boobies, and fancy gadget cars, and not have to think.
[284:54.36]But you are wrong.
[284:55.82]We will have these things, oui, but that is not the point.
[284:58.54]We will revolutionize the series with a post-postmodern mise-en-scène.
[285:03.64]We will delve into the inner psyche of our hero.
[285:06.96]Outside, he is shooting wristwatch missiles, avoiding crotch table saws, making big-breasted women moan with animal pleasure.
[285:15.19]But inside, he is spitting at the gods, despairing over the absurdity of existence, n'est-ce pas?
[285:21.67]I know, I know, you are thinking, oh, Jean Benoit, this is a spy blockbuster, I do not see how you can make it art.
[285:29.05]That is because you are a simple man who lives by his calloused gorilla hands, and not his mind.
[285:34.09]No offense.
[285:35.23]Okay, out of my office, you bore me.
[285:37.31]Bring in my art director, tell her I want to finger paint, I need to be inspired.
[285:41.57]Maintenant, au revoir.
[285:46.65]I don't know if you got this from Mr. Pretentious, but this is a spy movie with a giant fan base.
[285:53.05]In this first scene, you'll double for Simon Crown.
[285:55.46]He was going to do the same thing twice.
[285:59.52]The feature stunt happens on a bridge.
[286:01.86]Take out a couple cars.
[286:03.32]Then take the ramp onto the bridge railing.
[286:06.06]The trick is to keep yourself mostly parallel to the railing when you jump.
[286:10.14]Don't go too fast or turn too sharply to the right, or you'll overshoot and crash into the ravine.
[286:16.47]Okay people, welcome to my set.
[286:19.12]If you did not come to make out, go back home to your miserable little lives.
[286:23.84]Yeah, you do.
[286:25.02]Alright.
[286:26.98]Three, two, one, action.
[286:28.98]No, James Bond.
[286:31.12]Close to the explosion.
[286:35.10]Hard left.
[286:38.42]Good turn right.
[286:40.08]Close to the explosion.
[286:40.72]It's over there.
[286:56.96]If the chute's over, it's tough.
[287:00.83]Trip turn right.
[287:03.99]Cut.
[287:05.17]If you die from the... 3, 2, 1, action.
[287:11.48]Play James Bond in the background.
[287:12.60]Close to the explosion.
[287:13.46]Like that, like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[287:16.46]Hard left, sir.
[287:32.14]I fell all the way down.
[287:33.64]Oh, shit.
[287:41.71]Leaning back.
[287:44.65]Oh, dear.
[287:45.59]I've made a couple of mistakes.
[287:47.79]Looks like I'm going to be in a little bit of trouble here.
[287:50.15]Okay.
[287:51.87]Goodbye.
[287:52.41]See ya.
[288:00.20]Hard left.
[288:03.74]Use action.
[288:09.00]Double to ledge.
[288:10.93]Use action.
[288:15.03]Turn right.
[288:16.65]Overtake left.
[288:28.83]Close to the semi, not under the semi.
[288:31.20]You got it.
[288:33.42]Hit the jump.
[288:33.90]What jump?
[288:34.66]Is it a jump?
[288:36.18]Hard right.
[288:36.64]Throw a 180.
[288:41.74]Through the gap.
[288:43.96]Throw a 180.
[288:49.57]I'm a wheelie.
[288:53.09]Cut!
[288:54.53]I tried to accept your shortcomings, but I cannot.
[288:58.84]So two 180s in a row.
[289:05.87]Let me try to turn quicker.
[289:10.99]That looks better.
[289:13.23]Well, quicker turns.
[289:14.54]Here we go, quicker.
[289:18.38]Nice.
[289:19.66]Quicker than that.
[289:21.10]Nice.
[289:28.74]Looking good.
[289:32.65]Use action.
[289:35.93]Shit everywhere.
[289:36.79]It's alright.
[289:39.67]You're turning right.
[289:46.03]OK, why?
[289:46.83]That seems like it was a cross up there.
[289:48.41]3, 2, 1, action.
[289:50.89]Close to the explosion.
[290:02.02]Alright.
[290:02.60]Part of me thinks I'm playing an action game because it seems like it's shooting bullets at me.
[290:06.71]Am I going to take damage?
[290:08.43]Oops.
[290:12.91]Turn the fucking motorcycle.
[290:15.05]3, 2, 1, action.
[290:19.04]I'm going to get hold of the left.
[290:38.82]Gotta go so much slower.
[290:42.95]I'm just- I'm drawing too fast.
[291:03.62]There we go.
[291:04.75]And I didn't even get it.
[291:05.87]I didn't even get it.
[291:06.67]Unbelievable.
[291:07.31]Why?
[291:07.39]He's not going to get that to me.
[291:08.15]Use action.
[291:10.43]Seriously?
[291:12.13]Good turn right.
[291:17.89]Overtake left.
[291:20.53]Close to the semi.
[291:21.39]3, 2, 1.
[291:24.88]I have to go faster.
[291:27.24]Close to the explosion.
[291:43.54]Bring it together.
[291:46.81]Slow down a little.
[291:50.35]Stupid-ass snow.
[291:54.65]The snow just kills you, man.
[291:57.39]It's like times ten.
[291:59.46]He landed on the snow, and you may as well just drift into the fucking wall every time.
[292:25.96]See, I'm holding left.
[292:36.05]That one part right there.
[292:37.53]Delete it from the game.
[292:39.33]Delete that part from the game.
[292:41.13]Just like fucking shave that off.
[293:07.64]Ah!
[293:08.22]He hit me directly with that.
[293:21.00]180.
[293:21.14]In the snow.
[293:21.68]180 in the snow.
[293:25.47]Through the gap.
[293:25.99]180 in the snow.
[293:27.25]Don't go too fast!
[293:35.25]Oh shit!
[293:39.25]The box?!
[293:40.37]That wasn't even that bad.
[293:42.15]That wasn't even that bad.
[293:43.71]That wasn't even that bad.
[294:17.65]Three with two X's.
[294:18.79]That hit someone?
[294:29.35]That was weird.
[294:41.20]See, right?
[294:41.68]I barely... Director commentary here.
[294:44.68]While I was on this bike, I had almost no control of this.
[294:48.16]The director actually told me, just close your eyes when you do this part.
[294:51.30]Because you may as well... It's going to be the same thing, whether or not you open or close your eyes.
[294:55.16]So I was like, yeah, you know, that makes sense.
[295:06.21]He's such a great director, though.
[295:07.99]Oh, I love him.
[295:10.25]He's so smart.
[295:10.85]He's one of those real smart directors.
[295:15.06]Now you'll play Crown again, chasing the enemy spy through the base.
[295:19.50]We've got a great stunt planned near the missile silo.
[295:22.44]When the explosion blocks the path between you and the lead, you turn and go back the way you came.
[295:28.44]The platform above you will collapse, creating a ramp.
[295:32.02]Dodge the falling platform, throw another 180, and drive up the ramp to the second level.
[295:37.72]Try not to lose speed in your turn so you can avoid the falling road and keep up with the lead.
[295:43.08]Are you gonna crush this guy?
[295:44.94]Spy.
[295:45.02]If you manage to kill them, I assure you, you will not get me.
[295:48.35]That guy just Mario jumped.
[296:12.05]He just Super Mario 1 jumped in the air.
[296:27.49]What do you want me to do?
[296:33.64]Scrape?
[296:34.50]My gun?
[296:36.08]Huh?
[296:38.02]Holy!
[296:38.44]I did it!
[296:39.52]I did that!
[296:40.16]I very, that was so, I did it perfectly!
[296:42.14]I did that!
[296:43.36]I'm so, that's, of anything, I'm... I did that shit.
[296:56.94]You saw my wheels go up, my wheels went down.
[297:21.96]Going faster than the other actor Three two one action use action I was looking to check one action use action Break through throw 180
[297:54.04]Me too.
[297:58.90]Ow.
[298:13.51]Well, get over here!

[298:33.21]Hit the object.
[298:34.55]Ah.
[298:34.65]Use action.
[298:35.05]Smash through the guardrail.
[298:40.03]What?
[298:40.63]The guardrail.
[298:43.95]Pass under.

[298:51.73]Break through.
[299:03.55]Good good start Good start
[299:43.03]Under what here?
[299:50.47]That's very hard you should have said very hard
[300:05.62]Oh no, it's gonna collapse on me!
[300:17.73]I didn't know when they're gonna come up.
[300:19.87]You gotta like trial and error play the match fucking ten times before you know what to do!
[300:31.79]Yeah, right.
[300:35.84]Yeah, right.
[300:36.46]That's not happening.
[300:55.69]I'm so much of a better actor.
[300:56.75]I can drive so much faster than both of you.
[301:01.21]Drip turn right.
[301:02.81]Hit the object.
[301:04.51]Catch up to the lead vehicle.
[301:07.66]Drip turn left.

[301:40.62]Good.
[301:40.92]Alright, here come the 180s.
[302:01.84]Why are you here?
[302:03.08]Why are you here?
[302:07.79]That comes up on you too quickly.
[302:09.59]And all these sounds.
[302:12.65]I'm gonna lose my fucking mind in here.
[302:14.65]Guys, you know what?
[302:20.98]No.
[302:24.64]I'm not going up on two fucking wheels.
[302:31.40]He's coming right at it.
[302:40.18]Three.
[303:08.81]No, I don't want to have it load again.
[303:10.49]It's alright.
[303:10.79]Give me three attempts and that's it.
[303:11.76]I promise.
[303:12.10]Three attempts and we're done.
[303:33.71]No bullshit either.
[303:35.13]Every attempt is an attempt.
[303:36.65]Even if like, oh, I fucked up right here.
[303:39.27]No, every attempt is an attempt.

[305:09.46]That's one.
[305:10.18]That's it.
[305:10.56]That's one.
[305:12.54]Nope, I'm done after two more of these.
[305:17.38]Inside that little area.
[305:18.66]It's so hard to get like a drift You have what amounts to like a studio apartment to fucking turn around Left straight the gun truck two wheel past the missile
[305:46.51]I just forgot that was even here.
[305:47.61]Oh fuck!
[306:17.63]Objective smash.
[306:18.77]Drift.
[306:29.12]I'm trying to keep the string going.
[306:33.10]I'm trying to keep the string going.
[306:52.16]I fucking... My mouse just fell down.
[306:58.38]That's so hard to get in the right spot, man.
[307:07.61]That's too hard to do that.
[307:08.91]You need to be so precise.
[307:10.83]Shit.
[307:14.16]This is the last one.
[307:17.08]How are you supposed to turn on a dime like that shit?
[307:23.38]Scrape you.
[307:44.70]You dumb motherfucker.
[307:45.86]You just ruined everything.
[307:47.35]This was decent.
[307:48.69]It was a decent run.
[307:49.69]And you blew everything.
[308:23.90]It's alright.
[308:32.50]No, no, no!
[308:33.64]Your turn!
[308:34.08]Is this possible still?
[308:46.43]Turn right!
[308:51.95]There's no fucking way.
[308:53.79]I don't think anyone can do that.
[308:56.06]No one.
[308:58.18]How do you drift turn into that and go up on two wheels and do this?
[309:26.14]Fuck that level
[309:42.14]Next, you'll double for crown as he chases his rival over a frozen lake.
[309:46.32]There's a tricky line as you exit the base.
[309:48.92]Jump onto the roof, then keep gunning it as you make the second jump over the base wall.
[309:53.93]As soon as you land, hit your nitrous switch and speed through the narrow pass, ending with a big jump over a ravine.
[310:00.37]You'll be going too fast for big turns, so pick your line early and only make small adjustments.
[310:06.49]This ice, it will be very challenging, but do not fight to me like
[310:12.57]Not completed, didn't finish.
[310:16.31]Three, two, one, action.
[310:20.63]Use action.

[311:50.77]Nice.
[311:51.25]It's slippery.
[311:54.27]It's slippery.
[312:00.49]I technically did it.
[312:01.27]It's alright.
[312:09.36]I did it.
[312:10.34]I technically drifted in the right spot.
[312:12.46]3, 2, 1, action!
[312:21.07]Use action.
[312:23.43]U-turn.
[312:25.21]Close to the explosion.

[312:40.28]Close to the explosion.
[312:43.51]Trip turn left.
[312:46.19]Take a bump.
[312:56.26]Now where?
[312:57.04]Down here?
[312:57.44]I got a bolt.
[313:11.45]Oh, this turn.
[313:12.45]I'm still in a turn.
[313:19.41]Dude!
[313:21.91]Oh!
[313:23.53]It's so...
[313:25.13]Slippery.
[313:27.35]Oh, thank you for saving me, guy.
[313:29.39]Three, two, one, action.
[313:43.22]This is just like going sledding.
[313:45.46]I don't have any control of this car.
[313:49.49]Three, two, one, action.
[313:52.61]Use action.
[314:08.72]I can take like one or two ice levels.
[314:14.24]You can't have a whole zone based around ice levels.
[314:16.88]I'm sorry.
[314:33.16]I just want to finish the damn thing.
[314:37.74]I'm trying.
[314:43.37]Still got it.
[314:49.17]Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me.
[314:51.39]You've got to be kidding me.
[314:53.51]That's just... That's angering no matter how you say it.
[314:58.74]It's infuriating no matter how you look at it.
[315:11.49]I went faster on the rebound there than I did in holding down acceleration.
[315:26.41]This is a Mario Maker level.
[315:29.59]I've played this one already.
[315:49.45]And I'm not gonna lie, I really think I can control a car better than this in real life on a full ice lake.
[315:57.05]It's like they dialed up the slipperiness by like 600%.
[315:59.13]Use action.
[315:59.83]Stay behind the lead vehicle and close to the gun truck.
[316:08.28]Use action.

[316:36.39]No one does this.
[316:37.47]Not even in the movies.
[316:39.57]They drive on roads.
[316:48.28]We're driving down a mountain.

[320:25.47]Dude, you can't turn.
[320:40.63]I gotta go slower over that.
[320:42.05]You can't turn the car.
[320:45.09]I wish you could play this.
[320:46.01]I wish I could give this to you right now so you could be like, oh shit, okay, I get it.
[320:49.59]I see what you mean by that.
[320:51.84]Just you play.
[320:52.54]Just take it for a second.

[321:54.60]God.
[321:58.48]It doesn't... How do you do that?
[322:01.25]How is it... I should have failed that.
[322:05.03]That's why this game don't make no sense.

[323:29.03]I did.
[323:33.17]I could be in here.
[323:33.97]I could sit here and just be like... No, let's do it.

[324:30.21]Okay, here we go.
[324:31.07]Was that enough speed?
[324:33.15]I'm trying not to go so fast.

[328:16.98]We need a facecam?
[328:17.66]I'm shirtless and sweating.
[328:20.43]In this scene, you'll get to double for the enemy spy, chasing Crown as you and your fellow agents try to kill him.
[328:26.80]Our big moment comes at the end... Next level's worse.
[328:29.96]I hated this one.
[328:31.04]Next one's worse.
[328:33.08]As close to a semi as a chopper smashes into it, fire missiles at the cliffs, and knock some glaciers into Crown's path.
[328:41.46]Remember, you are the enemy!
[328:49.38]Ah, okay.
[328:50.07]180 on ice.

[329:57.75]Too much!
[329:59.51]Too... I can't imagine making these levels and then playing them and being like, yeah, people will like this.
[330:11.64]This is good.
[330:17.68]Anybody in the studio have any fucking hair left?
[330:20.72]Oh, no, it's all patchy.
[330:22.00]Everyone's, like, ripped it all out.
[330:23.62]Oh, that's fine.
[330:24.86]3, 2, 1, action.
[330:25.46]Pass close to the truck.
[331:06.85]Fuck this damn movie.

[331:31.56]No, no, no, no, no.
[331:32.62]No way.
[331:33.12]Not possible.
[331:33.76]I'm not going to try to do it anymore.
[331:35.48]That's just not possible.
[331:36.52]No one can do that.
[331:36.98]I don't think anybody could.
[331:44.82]What were they thinking?
[331:45.48]3, 2, 1, action.
[331:47.83]Pass close to the truck.
[331:49.03]Follow the lead vehicle.
[331:50.29]Turn left.
[331:52.79]Use action.
[331:53.05]Close to the semi.
[332:08.63]That's not fair man.
[332:11.08]That's not fair.
[332:12.34]It really isn't.
[332:32.89]I just want to get to the end of this level.
[332:35.13]I'm going to do whatever it takes to just get like 10 points.
[332:38.29]Who cares?
[332:52.06]Cut!
[332:55.82]This is not how a spy would drive.
[333:02.49]No, a spy would not drive on ice.
[333:06.33]He would get a fucking ice pick, goggles, and a ski mask, and he would climb the damn mountain and bring a tent and shit.
[333:13.93]And that's how he would infiltrate, and that's how he would get away.
[333:15.89]Because he'd be smart, he wouldn't be stupid, and drive like 80 on fucking ice.
[333:21.01]Three, two, one, action.
[333:23.35]Pass close to the truck.
[333:26.33]James Bond didn't do this.
[333:29.58]He was smarter than that.
[333:32.44]And why is your entire base made out of ice?
[333:37.17]Where is this supposed to be?
[333:42.21]What?
[333:43.07]Where is... Why is this here?
[333:44.45]There's a base here?
[333:45.77]Cut.
[333:55.56]Your inability to...
[334:02.64]Nobody can drive on it.
[334:04.38]Yeah, even they can't drive on it.
[334:07.44]Oh my god.
[334:10.88]The setting of Goldeneye.
[334:12.38]He used a ski jumper.
[334:13.94]Whatever the fuck the things are called.
[334:15.83]He used a snowmobile.
[334:17.35]He didn't use a street car.
[334:42.67]I'm- it's- you have to go faster than this ship.
[334:46.05]No fucking way.
[334:47.47]You go that fast, you ain't gonna make it at a million years.
[334:53.87]Throw a 180.
[334:54.75]Yeah, okay.
[334:56.37]This is a developer joke.
[334:57.63]Three, two, one, action.
[335:02.66]Pass close to the truck.
[335:03.46]Follow the lead vehicle, shift turn left.
[335:06.82]Use action.
[335:32.35]The whole thing has to be ice.
[335:36.13]The whole course.
[335:39.09]Sonic Racers didn't even have this shit.
[335:41.42]Mario Kart doesn't even have a level like this.
[335:44.78]Across the entire, like, 16 Mario Kart games.
[335:52.16]3, 2, 1.
[335:52.30]Cartoons don't even have this shit.
[335:53.82]Use action.
[336:19.50]no I don't want to watch an instant replay I want to like be out of this terrible terrible very awful bad place
[336:35.44]I'm waiting for the guy to come out of the closet with a camera.
[336:39.04]Hey, we just want to let you know we got you.
[336:41.51]Streamers get bad.
[336:43.91]That whole ice level, that whole thing was made from the ground up just to fuck with you.
[336:47.35]Really?
[336:47.77]No way.
[336:48.91]Yeah, yeah.
[336:49.43]I mean, it's such a dog shit level.
[336:52.09]The whole thing sucks.
[336:53.49]It's not real.
[336:54.26]Look over there.
[336:54.80]There's a camera over there too.
[336:57.38]Oh, in the corner?
[336:58.08]No way.
[336:58.88]How long has that been there for?
[337:00.44]You know, a few months.
[337:01.08]Sorry.
[337:04.07]Oh, OK.
[337:04.27]Pass close to the truck.

[337:16.22]We don't keep any of the footage that we recorded, though.
[337:17.56]Don't worry.
[337:17.80]Drift turn left.
[337:18.18]Use action.
[337:25.30]Drift turn right.
[337:34.28]Please just get me to the end.
[337:36.12]Just please get me to the end of this level.
[337:45.13]There's not a chance in hell that you could do that.
[337:54.55]What?
[338:05.03]180, and then reverse.
[338:07.23]3, 2, 1, action.

[338:30.62]I don't care about anything.
[338:32.38]I just want to get to the end.
[338:42.36]I just want to get to the end.
[338:45.41]This doesn't look fun.
[338:46.85]Oh, I can tell you with 100% certainty, it isn't.
[338:49.27]So, don't worry about that.
[338:53.49]It doesn't look like that.
[338:55.05]Because it isn't.
[339:08.16]Use action.
[339:13.92]Close to the semi.
[339:14.32]Cap the gun trucks.
[339:14.72]Trip turn left.
[339:15.08]You can't, like, touch.
[339:15.90]Play Operation with the cars, too.
[339:18.26]What's up with that horse manure?
[339:19.60]Trip turn right.
[339:21.61]You've got to play Operation with the cars on ice.
[339:23.79]Pass under the semi.
[339:45.42]Put it on easy.
[339:47.01]Are there difficulties?
[339:49.33]There are no difficulties in this game.
[339:51.87]There's only ice.
[339:54.05]There's just ice.
[339:54.61]There's nothing else.
[339:57.03]You got ice.
[339:59.95]And then you got a car.
[340:01.11]There's only one difficulty.
[340:02.43]It's ice.
[340:29.89]No way!
[340:32.49]No way!
[340:33.53]Has anybody completed this fucking game?
[340:38.74]Can I look at, like, the global trophies?
[340:45.50]One.
[340:46.14]Action.
[340:46.34]Pass close to the truck.
[340:47.42]Follow the lead vehicle.
[340:53.45]Have more people beat Orphan than have done this level.
[340:59.39]I can't imagine fucking just playing this casually and then going like, well, I'll never do this again.
[341:03.49]Like that guy.
[341:04.81]Like that one guy earlier.
[341:06.12]Use action.
[341:10.36]Drift turn right.
[341:14.42]Three, two, one, action.
[341:16.22]Pass close to the truck.
[341:29.09]Alright, let this be like a game design 101 lesson for you guys.
[341:38.11]This is how you get people to break their discs.
[341:42.80]You make a whole entire area based on slippery ice in a driving game.
[341:47.94]3, 2, 1, action.
[341:53.94]Pass close to the truck.
[342:09.42]What is... I want to know what the last mission is here.
[342:14.55]Does the game uninstall itself after this part?
[342:24.02]Slowing down doesn't help because you need to get there in a certain amount of time.
[342:55.94]Oh operation Oh
[343:18.99]Oh my god.
[343:23.07]No, no, no, no, no, I'm gonna skip this level.
[343:27.39]I would rather... No, never mind.
[343:41.34]I can't even give you a reason to have this.
[343:48.10]What's the last area?
[343:51.27]What?
[343:51.51]It has to be... Did they just go back to, like, formula?
[343:59.05]This is out-fucking-rageous!
[344:11.29]You can't!
[344:18.89]Imagine doing this on PS2.
[344:20.40]Oh my god, no way!
[344:22.30]This... There was a lot of sad kids when this came out.
[344:28.60]People were probably crying.
[344:30.38]I imagine myself, tears streaming down my eyes, crying.
[344:34.26]As like, at like 17 or whatever.
[344:46.37]So the handbrake just slides you across the whole entire map.
[344:53.41]This is it for this one.
[344:55.55]I'm skipping this level.
[344:57.15]I'll come back to it.
[345:14.28]Oh my god!
[345:17.63]Just get up there!
[345:18.73]How far do I have to reverse?
[345:43.92]Hey, can I tell you this I'm bad at the game joke is and I got four stars Oh get out of here this bad at the game joke.
[345:58.02]It needs to stop Stop leave it alone He killed me
[346:31.21]I hope the next area is you run.
[346:34.47]I don't even have a car.
[346:57.00]I clearly had no idea what I was doing here.
[347:07.75]Thanks for watching!
[347:14.88]And that, holy shit, there's more.
[347:16.06]Oh no.
[347:18.10]Oh no.
[347:20.36]Okay, fresh start.
[347:21.52]The ground is trying to destroy the other hovercraft prototypes in the enemy base and hijack the last one.
[347:27.37]There's a tricky stunt with a crane.
[347:29.79]First, shoot the crane releasing its cargo, then two-wheel through the debris.
[347:34.67]Once you clear the cargo, drift right and gap through the destroyed crane arm.
[347:39.23]It's another high-risk stunt, so keep it safe.
[347:48.40]No, I'm going to relax.
[347:52.20]We're just going to relax and I'm going to get it done.
[347:55.08]Just calm down and play, right?
[347:58.56]Just play it.
[347:59.32]That's alright.
[348:00.02]There's no problem.
[348:02.96]Just relax.
[348:03.60]Throw a 180.
[348:13.81]That's alright.
[348:14.47]It's okay.
[348:15.15]I wasn't supposed to do that.
[348:31.85]I wasn't supposed to do it like that.
[348:35.75]This one is just a mess.
[348:37.63]Okay.
[348:49.43]It's fine.
[348:53.62]Scrape this guy.
[349:19.29]Does he... He already got scraped.
[349:25.10]I actually did that.
[349:25.94]Alright, I can do this.
[349:29.70]I went through him!
[349:39.29]He was a ghost!
[349:41.89]He was a ghost!
[349:43.51]He was a ghost!
[349:44.35]I...
[349:57.72]I had that too.
[350:00.85]I actually had that.
[350:01.67]I didn't miss.
[350:02.63]Replay that.
[350:29.97]alright let's go melt downstream melt downstream melt downstream melt downstream drive on two wheels you can't go that far smash the construction
[351:01.21]Got him.
[351:02.95]Scrape the gun truck.
[351:03.69]Nope, not going to.
[351:04.73]Use action.
[351:05.11]Drive on two wheels.
[351:13.73]That was two wheels.
[351:14.51]Drift turn right.
[351:16.81]Wasn't for very long, but it was two wheels.
[351:26.93]Scrape the gun truck.
[351:29.07]Pass close to weapons fire.
[351:31.27]Through the gap.
[351:32.11]Use action.
[351:32.99]You're turned right.
[351:36.95]Break through the gate.
[351:42.22]Crash through the guard tower.
[351:47.08]Through the gap.
[351:49.20]Uh-oh.
[351:50.52]Pass close to the gun truck.
[351:53.72]Use action.
[351:54.06]Take out the hovercraft.
[351:56.65]Got it.
[351:58.19]That's fine.
[351:58.77]I don't care what it is.
[352:03.00]Like the wise words of Vault Boy says good enough.
[352:08.64]Wise words.
[352:09.30]I don't want to see the replay either.
[352:30.28]Where is my mouse?
[352:34.51]It's like across the room.
[352:35.63]Uh oh, no no no no, easy easy.
[352:38.81]If I accidentally click a few buttons I might stop streaming.
[352:45.27]Alright, there we go.
[352:47.19]What was I trying to do with this?
[352:48.62]I don't remember.
[352:51.06]Alright, this next one's a hovercraft.
[352:52.32]This is the final one.
[352:53.10]In this last scene, you'll double for crown, escaping the enemy's hovercraft.
[352:57.46]For the key stunt, you'll jump into the submarine construction lock.
[353:04.79]This is the final scene.
[353:06.37]La pièce de résistance.
[353:07.77]Man versus man in the great clash of strength.
[353:12.16]Wait, did I just give myself a debuff?
[353:14.80]100% more slipperiness?
[353:15.58]3, 2, 1, action.
[353:19.98]Hit the gun truck.
[353:40.03]That's not the way to go.
[353:42.69]It's okay.
[353:45.81]I got it.
[353:46.19]We're gonna... It's too late to cause screams.
[353:50.15]You know what I mean?
[353:52.07]I got it all out of me.
[353:54.02]I'm not upset at anything.
[353:55.70]That was a fun level.
[354:00.78]I'm just gonna do it.
[354:02.26]But why?
[354:04.20]Why?
[354:11.69]The arrows are pointing in almost every direction.
[354:26.66]That's a jump?
[354:39.26]On the wreckage?
[354:40.14]Up here.
[354:49.71]Ooh, hard.
[354:50.51]Very hard.
[354:58.33]That one?
[355:09.34]Get in that box!
[355:13.78]He went inside the box.
[355:18.65]Unbelievable.
[355:19.57]Get in the box.
[355:32.63]Whatever.
[355:34.38]Whatever.
[355:34.72]Just get in the box.
[355:36.24]Just get in the box.
[355:40.92]Just go in the box.
[355:48.05]We still have one more area after this, and I accept it with open arms.
[356:06.14]The only way they would make this worse is if it was like anti-gravity, like with a spaceship for the next stunts.
[356:31.98]So anticlimactic going over this every time.
[356:38.29]Okay, almost there.
[356:47.31]Alright, into the box.
[356:53.27]Here we go.
[356:56.55]Line it up.
[357:02.79]Here we go.
[357:06.51]That's it.
[357:07.35]It's in.
[357:14.71]That was not even remotely as bad as that third level.
[357:30.24]Just watch the movie.
[357:36.62]night avenger unlocked this is the last area coming up I'm almost done with the game
[358:30.97]If this movie has more than 12% on Rotten Tomatoes, I'll eat a pair of shoes.
[358:39.92]Oh, the whole thing.
[358:45.17]I'm gonna check it.
[358:50.69]I'm not even in this movie, yeah?
[359:11.59]Alright guys enter the Avenger am I prepared for this I
[359:24.88]Hey, kid, Howard Reitman.
[359:26.12]Look, you know who I am.
[359:27.12]That's my wall of fame.
[359:28.14]Work with everyone.
[359:28.92]Tell him, Jack.
[359:29.56]Mr. Reitman's been directing since 67.
[359:31.30]He's incredible.
[359:32.00]They call him Mr. Hollywood.
[359:33.65]Thanks, Sarah.
[359:34.25]You're a doll.
[359:34.77]And handsome.
[359:35.55]Enough, Sarah.
[359:36.25]Jack, coffee, and ring Murphy at Pyramid.
[359:38.13]Sarah, go with him.
[359:38.87]Got it.
[359:39.15]Why does she... Anyway, you've heard of Night Avenger, right?
[359:41.09]Huge comic book.
[359:42.07]Well, we're making that.
[359:43.03]Fans screamed for it for years, but it was trapped in development hell.
[359:45.87]But when I told Pyramid I wanted it, they jumped up and checked.
[359:49.97]I've got Murphy on the line, sir.
[359:51.27]Great.
[359:51.55]Tell him I'll call him back in 40 seconds.
[359:53.33]You've got a decent resume.
[359:54.73]Aftershock, Overdrive, Whoopin' 2.
[359:57.05]Right.
[359:57.69]That Baxter screw-up and his friends.
[359:59.67]What a mess.
[360:00.51]Can't believe it grows 200 mil.
[360:02.23]Mr. Reitman's last film grossed 600.
[360:04.74]That's true, sir.
[360:05.66]She's great with numbers.
[360:06.74]Wardrobe's got a problem with the latex suit, sir.
[360:08.66]Too much room.
[360:09.22]Oh, I just lost him, Snake.
[360:10.40]Where's my guy next to me?
[360:11.76]My friend.
[360:12.66]The jokes are fucking empty at the moment.
[360:14.14]I'm sorry.
[360:15.16]you're known as the best in the world.
[360:16.74]Let me down, and well, Jack here, he was directing summer blockbusters before he got on my bad side, but now we get along splendidly, right Jack?
[360:24.80]You're incredible, Mr. Reitman.
[360:26.20]See you on set.
[360:28.01]It's like, rewind that, like, make it funnier, because he plays Snake.
[360:30.83]Uh-oh.
[360:30.99]Yeah.
[360:31.11]Okay, this is not
[360:58.72]I get to wear the suit too?
[360:59.80]Nice.
[361:01.02]I don't think I could get angry here because I get to wear the suit.
[361:36.43]I thought that was gonna happen much earlier.
[361:48.95]I thought it was gonna be this one, cause I saw the Cocker.
[361:56.51]Did it!
[361:58.19]Nominated for an Emmy!
[362:12.23]I wonder how- really?
[362:13.97]That's so stupid.
[362:17.84]Use action.
[362:19.54]Try action.
[362:26.56]The Avengers!
[362:30.34]No!
[362:30.90]No!
[362:41.31]What the fuck do I do now?
[362:51.90]Ooh, I just barely made it.
[362:56.94]Ooh, whoops.
[363:07.51]I can't, not enough time.
[363:14.36]What the?
[363:25.28]Move.
[363:29.24]Whatever.
[363:40.25]What do I do?
[363:47.75]That was pretty cool.
[363:56.51]I'm okay with two stars at the end of the night here.
[364:03.17]Let's watch that one.
[364:24.05]So I failed that one.
[364:27.03]Collectively come together and find out why.
[364:28.47]It's because you're bald.
[364:43.89]Oh.
[364:45.37]Alright, yeah.
[364:47.47]That makes sense.
[364:50.43]Oh, yeah, okay.
[365:12.79]This is like a college film.
[365:15.67]Alright, what's the next scene?
[365:36.40]Oh, it's more bike.
[365:37.26]I love the bike.
[365:38.46]It is.
[365:41.52]Alright, you'll double as Night Avenger again, trying to stop Big Top from killing the mayor.
[365:46.50]The toughest stunt is early in the run.
[365:48.86]Take a sharp left turn, then line up to go beneath the semi-trailer with enough speed to jump over the cop cars right after.
[365:56.15]Then cross to the next stunt box and fire at Big Top's henchmen, and wipe them out.
[366:04.10]Did I tell you that I know Frank Jones, the leader of the camera?
[366:07.80]He got most of his ideas from me.
[366:10.20]Did I tell you that I knew?
[366:11.24]Three, two, one.
[366:13.88]Action.
[366:14.48]Follow the lead vehicle.
[366:16.00]Overtake right.
[366:16.60]Hard left.
[366:22.65]Pass under.
[366:23.01]Jump the cop cars.
[366:24.45]Use action.
[366:26.91]No, this is... Okay, I'm doing fine.
[366:29.23]Overtake.
[366:34.42]Cut.
[366:37.84]Cut.
[366:38.90]Get back in the shot.
[366:40.18]What are you talking about?
[366:41.30]I'm right behind him.
[366:42.06]I'm right behind him.
[366:43.16]3, 2, 1, action.
[366:45.71]Follow the lead vehicle.
[366:46.93]Follow the lead vehicle.
[366:47.79]I was right behind him.
[366:48.87]3, 2, 1, action.
[366:56.85]Follow the lead vehicle.
[366:58.40]Overtake right.
[367:25.01]I was going the right way and then you dropped the cop car on me and it didn't knock me off the bike and put me on the other side of the road.
[367:35.48]Honestly, he might just say at this point, try not to die.
[367:40.11]Don't die.
[367:41.94]Careful, don't die.
[367:42.76]This'll kill you.
[367:45.74]Trying to kill you.
[368:10.66]I'm impressed I ask a lot of my stuntmen I know that and you sir you pulled it off free the first attempt looked fantastic yeah unfortunately
[368:40.54]Let's see if they edited it up in post.
[368:43.20]Edited it.
[368:45.52]Edited it.
[368:48.56]Edited it.
[368:49.58]That is right.
[368:50.22]That's correct.
[368:50.72]Sounds right.
[369:01.32]Is this Night Avenger or Tactical Intervention?
[369:10.12]They seem to share the same similarities here.
[369:15.24]Very nice.
[369:15.90]Clown car.
[369:28.49]Now you'll shoot the other side of the chase where Big Top is going after the mayor.
[369:32.87]This time you'll play Big Top.
[369:34.51]The focus is a two-wheeling stunt.
[369:36.54]You'll hit the ramp with your driver's side as the tunnel bends to the left.
[369:40.76]Make sure you're in control when you hit the ramp.
[369:43.06]If you're sliding all over the place, you'll mess up the stunt.
[369:45.90]Two-wheel it through the zone and a pair of vehicles will fly right over your head.
[369:50.89]Man, I love Big Top.
[369:52.77]I also like top hats.
[369:54.53]Why don't I have a top hat?
[369:55.83]Jack, go to Wardrobe and find me a top hat.
[369:59.25]Well, my character did lose all of his hair.
[370:01.33]Oh, did you expect me to get over there?
[370:28.55]two one action overtake right follow the mayor's car scrape the vehicle pass close to the cop car oh
[370:57.06]Just turn right.
[371:03.36]Hit the mayor.
[371:04.57]What did he just say?
[371:08.63]Did he say, you hit the mayor?
[371:13.09]Cut.
[371:14.40]Good.
[371:15.38]That's a run you can mostly be proud of.
[371:35.88]Watch out!
[371:36.42]You hit the mayor!
[371:37.92]What is he doing here?
[371:40.24]It's a dangerous set, man.
[372:12.01]Fucking usable footage.
[372:16.98]Ah, my stomach.
[372:17.84]God damn it.
[372:23.27]You keep that if you have the two or three days left of principal photography.
[372:31.82]Dude, we got like four hours left to close principal.
[372:34.32]We have to take the fuck out of here.
[372:35.56]Watch out for the toys!
[373:18.89]What did I do wrong?
[373:32.05]Scrape the police car, but there was no turn.
[373:34.97]Three, two, one, action.
[373:37.04]Close to the explosion.
[373:38.12]Through the gap.
[373:42.62]Scrape the police car.
[373:48.42]Ah.
[373:54.79]Well, that's unfortunate.
[373:58.37]Three, two, one, action.
[374:00.34]Close to the explosion.
[374:02.10]OK.
[374:02.20]Let's go.
[374:03.56]Through the gap.
[374:05.66]Straight to the police car.
[374:08.14]Here we go.
[374:23.51]I can do better than this.
[374:27.69]Hard right.
[374:28.45]Overtake the car.
[374:29.61]I'm throwing overtake here.
[374:32.73]Get close to the weapons fire.
[374:42.32]Two wheels through the traffic.
[374:46.52]Cut.
[374:48.04]Look, I know this is a tricky shot, but you're supposed to be the best, so be it.
[374:55.83]Oh no, you hit the mayor again.
[375:00.58]Boomer reflexes.
[375:04.14]Oh, great.
[375:07.94]Shit is exploding.
[375:10.46]I did.
[375:13.48]I did.
[375:17.14]I hit every... I drove long ways against the railing.
[375:21.76]Oh, fuck.
[375:23.94]Just restarted.
[375:37.55]I went through it.
[375:40.89]I'm serious.
[375:45.55]I've been in constant fucking laughter.
[375:48.24]Just constant stress this whole stream.
[375:56.54]If it's not like stomach stress from laughing, it's just like ice stress.
[376:05.64]Constant comments.
[376:13.22]No, that's not... I... I'm okay.
[376:14.52]I thought that was water.
[376:30.63]Ugh!
[376:40.66]Into the building.
[376:50.71]What?
[376:51.45]Oh.
[376:54.83]Into the building.
[376:55.35]Into the building.
[376:56.11]Do a wheelie.
[376:56.61]Do a wheelie.
[376:59.08]Close to the explosion.
[377:03.22]Operation.
[377:18.86]I did What the fuck
[377:54.38]Use action.
[377:55.48]Use action.
[377:56.68]Got it.
[377:58.34]Trip turn left.
[378:00.80]Follow the ice cream truck.
[378:01.70]Trip turn right.
[378:07.85]Use action.
[378:12.75]Use action.
[378:15.65]Where?
[378:16.03]Got it.
[378:24.28]Two.
[378:24.44]Three?
[378:24.64]Okay.
[378:25.00]Are we on the last two levels?
[378:25.73]Last for the campaign?
[378:26.37]I think so.
[379:03.87]There are two back wheels there.
[379:22.49]That's sloppy.
[379:39.23]You could probably 5-star on the first few.
[379:40.81]Like, I would destroy the first few levels.
[379:42.89]We'll see how much I've improved.
[379:47.33]When I'm done, I'll go back and just do the first few.
[380:14.43]Let's go.
[380:19.28]Only two remain.
[380:20.48]This is with the Batmobile and this is the both last two with the Batmobile.
[380:25.65]Now you'll double as Night Avenger, chasing Big Top in the climax.
[380:29.24]This focus stunt is a jump onto elevated train tracks.
[380:32.64]While you're on the roof, accelerate to crash into a Big Top helicopter and land on the L. Hit the copter at an angle so you'll be prepared to turn right when you land.
[380:42.13]Overtake the first train on the left side, then veer to the right to avoid the second oncoming train.
[380:47.23]This is gonna take a few tries, I think.
[380:50.97]This is almost a million points.
[381:04.69]You told me to kill that guy.
[381:09.11]What do you mean?
[381:09.87]I hit the... Did I touch the lead vehicle?
[381:34.98]I don't think I did.
[382:06.74]Your turn.
[382:13.14]Oh shit.
[382:35.29]Let me see let me see it Oh
[383:24.09]Oh, if only I had enough speed!
[383:32.55]I can do it.
[383:33.21]Let me see if I can do it.
[383:35.46]Let me see if I can get enough speed going back.
[384:11.03]I don't have to do it like this.
[384:13.41]Why am I doing it the same way I did before?
[384:16.63]Here we go.
[384:39.34]Fuck!
[384:40.70]Come on!
[384:41.58]That had to have been close.
[384:46.00]That had to have been close.
[384:49.08]Going through backwards would be so awesome.
[384:51.00]It would have been so cool.
[385:07.26]Motorcycle!
[385:07.58]Break the vehicle!
[385:32.74]I can do it.
[385:34.28]No, it would do that.
[385:35.06]That would make me go forward.
[385:51.04]Cut!
[385:51.62]We don't have cameras over there!
[386:00.87]Nice five point turn.
[386:02.59]I'm gonna get it by a train.
[386:10.30]Ugh, this game is insane.
[386:32.06]Drift turn left.
[386:34.28]Break through.
[386:37.92]U-turn.
[386:41.38]Action.
[386:44.33]What?
[386:46.37]I pressed it.
[386:46.97]It has to happen sometimes, man.
[386:51.41]Drift turn right.
[386:52.95]Pass close to the explosion.
[386:56.69]It's a gyrocopter.
[386:58.07]Overtake left.
[387:02.13]Oh, God.
[387:02.55]The gavel.
[387:35.89]Simpsons hit and run.
[387:36.95]Simpsons hit and run.
[387:39.01]Simpsons hit and run.
[387:42.85]I'm fucking getting flashbacks.
[387:47.66]With the green shit all over the ground.
[387:51.04]Alright, I'm good.
[388:04.37]This is the one.
[388:13.30]This is the one, perfect.
[388:27.58]Perfect!
[388:30.69]Five stars, let's see it.
[388:37.92]Oh fuck.
[388:45.65]I can make it, I can make it, I can make it!
[388:48.37]I'm still on, I'm still on.
[388:50.11]I got it twice.
[388:51.29]Oh no.
[388:52.07]Ugh.
[389:02.68]I gotta d- seriously.
[389:08.02]Look at how good this was.
[389:09.12]I was still on track, too.
[389:19.09]I could have made it or something.
[389:28.23]I cleaned this up good, too.
[389:29.49]Look at his turn.
[389:31.25]That looks so nice.
[389:56.56]I got something to say.
[389:58.36]For all the stuff that Batman does, and all the crazy shit you see in like, oh, in this car racing movie, or this game, or Batman, or Superman when he drives the supercar.
[390:10.63]I don't even know if Superman has a car.
[390:12.41]He might.
[390:14.11]They... That would happen, probably.
[390:18.97]You're talking about like a 1% chance?
[390:21.49]Or like a 0.5% chance?
[390:25.31]to do any of these things even driving by this person in front of me is like a point two percent chance that you'll actually do that I'm surprised Batman's not been hit by more trains it doesn't matter how good you are at driving three two one going this 200 feet right here not possible like no way you will lose
[391:05.66]Superman can fly.
[391:09.60]So what?
[391:09.90]He doesn't have a car.
[391:11.28]What about Clark Kent?
[391:16.36]You think Clark Kent flies around?
[391:18.12]No, he's got a car.
[391:27.79]He doesn't take the bus?
[391:30.53]How much money does Clark Kent have?
[391:32.13]He's not like a billionaire, but he's probably doing alright.
[391:44.81]Clark Kent's net worth is probably... What does he work?
[391:49.15]He has the glasses on, he has the tie and everything.
[391:55.59]Is he a lawyer?
[392:06.05]Somebody look that up.
[392:06.91]What does Clark Kent do when he's not... what does Clark Kent do?
[392:12.44]Maybe he doesn't work at a hot dog stand.
[392:18.82]He's a journalist.
[392:25.65]He's a journal... journalist, journalist, okay.
[392:27.73]He's a newspaper journalist.
[392:35.35]This is where it fucks me up every time.
[392:39.58]Got it this time.
[392:41.66]Oh.
[393:01.81]You actor!
[393:02.53]You actor!
[393:03.28]You actor!
[393:11.42]Did I get him?
[393:24.98]Cut!
[393:26.16]I don't have time to wait for paramedics.
[393:28.18]Jack, get in there!
[393:33.62]Three, two, one, action.
[393:38.19]He's gone.
[393:38.63]Five stars.
[393:39.27]Guaranteed.
[393:39.85]I guarantee it.
[393:41.41]Trip turn left.
[393:45.53]Pass close to the explosion.
[393:50.39]Hit the motorcycle.
[393:50.91]Raise the vehicle.
[394:36.97]I still got it.
[394:38.65]It was a five star up until that point.
[394:43.01]Where am I going?
[394:55.70]Fucking Simpsons hit and run, man.
[395:03.28]It's the same place.
[395:06.55]That guy's just fucked.
[395:11.38]That was a five star fucking run.
[395:13.54]And the stupid turn ruined everything, I guarantee it.
[395:51.07]Eat my fucking ass.
[395:52.67]That was bullshit.
[395:53.41]I was in there.
[395:57.92]You saw it.
[395:58.50]Like, I'm in there.
[395:59.76]Don't even give me that shit.
[396:04.54]Got it.
[396:22.82]Through the gap.
[396:52.39]That was a big... Did I do it?
[397:30.60]Final level.
[397:35.96]Here we go.
[397:37.34]Okay, this is your final scene as Night Avenger tears through Big Top's hideout.
[397:41.51]A tricky stunt is driving on the roller coaster track.
[397:44.45]Shoot Big Top's henchman and get on the track.
[397:46.97]Then drift right around the horseshoe curve.
[397:49.61]As you're nearing the end, take an abrupt left to break through the railing.
[397:53.07]Then maintain your speed so you'll be set for the pass close to an explosion.
[397:56.96]This is your last chance to impress Mr. Reitman.
[397:59.46]Give it your all.
[398:01.07]Okay, boys and girls, time for the finale.
[398:03.73]Let's hurry it up so I can start shopping for my red carpet tux.
[398:11.89]Alright.
[398:13.09]Three, two, one, action.
[398:15.28]Drift turn right.
[398:25.18]Use action.
[398:34.57]What do you want me to do?

[400:41.80]400,000?
[400:41.82]What was that 5 stars?
[400:44.12]Cut.
[400:44.76]Yes.
[400:45.54]Unbelievable, kid.
[400:47.25]Every producer in Hollywood's gonna know about you.
[400:49.93]I know because I've got them on speaker.
[400:57.08]That's how you go out strong.
[401:00.64]Five-star.
[401:11.00]I'm going to get a five-star replay.
[401:24.47]See, the guarantee was for this level, not the last one.
[401:26.99]My guarantee meter was off a little bit.
[401:30.11]That could have been cleaner, but... Just fly right off.
[402:19.92]There it is.
[402:22.04]Alright.

[425:58.27]All light.
[425:59.67]Nothing else.
[426:06.18]Ah, here's chickens!
[426:08.66]Let's see... Start from here.
[426:27.43]Ready?
[426:27.89]One, two, three.
[426:29.01]Damn it!
[426:47.78]Burning construction barrel.
[426:52.00]What is this?
[426:59.19]Clown cars.
[427:01.11]A scaffolding.
[427:04.57]It's like a Mario Maker level.
[427:05.83]It's like a Mario Maker level with just odd pieces.
[427:12.97]Well, I know I'm going to do this.
[427:45.49]Sonic level.
[427:47.91]It really is going to be a Sonic level.
[427:53.89]Not doing this right.
[428:00.59]Nitro here.
[428:01.64]No, go this way.
[428:10.45]Alright, and then you have to give a little bit of room.
[428:24.48]And then I need nitrous over here.
[428:25.72]Alright, that's good.
[428:32.54]Let's spice it up a little.
[428:55.27]That's it.
[428:56.75]Big head top camera ramp.
[429:04.33]Kick ramp?
[429:06.57]No, I need like a special, I need a, what is a nitrous thing?
[429:26.89]Firework crate.
[429:29.34]Remote car.
[429:31.16]Exploding propane tank.
[429:33.32]Train.
[429:34.40]Fire hoop.
[429:35.02]Where is it?
[429:43.08]Should be in special, right?
[429:49.04]Crane.
[429:51.44]Change cars.
[429:55.02]Oh, here it is.
[429:55.40]Nitro box.
[429:56.66]Alright, let's do it here.
[429:57.80]Right there.
[430:04.42]Just get it everywhere.
[430:06.78]In front of each one.
[430:07.40]I don't know, I guess I don't put it there.
[430:12.80]Alright, is this... Can I even do this?
[430:19.70]This is kind of menacing.
[430:38.39]That did not work at all.
[430:41.00]Alright, how do I change the car that I spawn with?
[431:00.89]Hold, I'm gonna hold back.
[431:06.72]Let's go, let's try this one.
[431:07.96]Got it.
[431:43.16]Of course, this is my first choice.
[431:44.54]Yes, of course it is.
[431:45.30]Here we go.
[431:52.55]The door is open.
[431:54.23]The doors wouldn't open.
[431:55.09]The doors are closed.
[431:57.18]I need a muscle car.
[431:58.18]Uh-oh.
[432:16.63]No, I need a fast car.
[432:19.05]A very, very, very fast car.
[432:32.35]Velocity?
[432:33.60]That might do it.
[432:35.46]Let's go with the Black Dragon.
[432:40.04]I want a better... What do I want?
[432:43.69]Nice bright blue.
[432:46.83]Alright, let's go.
[432:52.53]Can I do it?
[432:54.77]Can I actually do it?
[432:59.16]Let me line this up.
[433:22.21]Well, I did one full revolution, so that's good.
[433:31.64]Fix me, fix me.
[433:45.72]One more, let's go!
[433:53.15]Yes!
[433:54.45]That feels really good.
[434:13.05]This car has nitro.
[434:19.64]Wait.
[434:19.90]That means I can use the big one, right?
[434:47.21]I want the... give me this one.
[434:50.77]Okay, good.
[434:56.18]This person's driving around.
[435:09.37]He's going into the STANDS!
[435:12.35]UGH!
[435:38.03]Invisible wall.
[435:44.11]Stunt City!
[435:45.03]That's a cool name.
[435:49.04]Let's try the explosion.
[435:55.08]Cool.
[435:55.46]Alright, I think that's it.
[436:04.79]Let me go back and make sure I didn't miss anything.
[436:13.05]Constructor... What is multi-clash?
[436:16.55]Is this multiplayer?
[436:26.72]We'll do one more on the bike.
[436:31.54]Did you miss the main story?
[436:32.52]Yeah, I went through the whole game.
[436:41.39]I didn't five-star every level, but I certainly completed it.
[436:52.97]That was about the missile.
[436:56.20]Oh yeah, he's gonna give up then.
[436:57.68]Yep.
[436:57.94]He's gonna say, do this, do that.
[437:00.83]Oh, that's cheating.
[437:02.41]No, I'm not gonna cheat.
[437:06.64]Didn't even get it.
[437:07.18]Wait.
[437:09.40]I went too fast.
[437:28.59]No square.
[437:29.13]Am I supposed to land on top of this?
[437:37.44]Oh, I have to jump over it.
[437:41.38]Sideways a few times.
[437:43.14]That counts, right?
[437:47.72]Alright, not bad.
[437:56.72]Ooh.
[437:57.68]Through there.
[437:58.76]Okay.
[437:59.86]Now what?
[438:08.53]I... Come on.
[438:12.17]That one did it.
[438:13.05]Did it.
[438:23.21]That one was actually really cool.
[438:27.69]Do I have to watch the five-star replay?
[438:29.58]I mean, you kind of have to every time, right?
[438:43.02]So LTXT error, that's... Not supposed to be happening.
[438:51.35]Does anyone actually know the difference between a five-star replay and a regular replay?
[438:55.85]You know what I'm trying to say.
[438:57.51]Is there a different thing?
[439:00.11]Do they do it better?
[439:00.81]Bad ending.
[439:14.37]I know I'm not getting any... What's the final one here?
[439:21.39]I already see frost.
[439:22.39]I don't want to do it.
[439:23.67]I do see boat jump, though.
[439:32.62]I would love another one of these games, though.
[439:35.44]This game's a lot of fun.
[439:37.22]Just that one level in the ice place was nearly almost a meltdown.
[439:41.53]I mean, it kind of was.
[439:43.51]That's the one thing that I didn't like about the whole game.
[439:46.67]And has like a seven to eight hour experience.
[439:50.89]I would love another one of these.
[439:52.65]With updated graphics and better engine.
[439:55.29]It'd be so much fun.
[439:57.91]I want to place the cameras.
[440:01.97]Imagine you had control of where you could place the cameras during the actual scene.
[440:05.08]It'd be awesome.
[440:12.72]Pass under the semi.
[440:19.94]onto the ship.
[440:20.58]Did I make it?
[440:21.03]I don't think I did.
[440:22.37]Just barely.
[440:27.27]That was close enough.
[440:30.79]That was close enough.
[440:32.33]Throw a 180.
[440:54.59]Alright.
[440:56.03]That's the first one star in a while.
[440:57.46]So here's what we're going to do.
[441:00.58]Because it's already been about seven and a half hours.
[441:04.22]I think I want to go relax for a little bit.
[441:08.48]Play a couple of rounds of Mario Yacht.
[441:12.25]I think that's what I'm thinking of.
[441:24.19]I'm kind of feeling it right now.
[441:26.00]Just to relax and just chill.
[441:29.04]And that's actually probably how we'll do the bits.
[441:31.92]Because I want to do the bits from last night as well, because they got cut off.
[441:36.49]So I think just playing some Yahtzee, going over the bits, sounds like an interesting way to chill out and end the stream, you know?
[441:45.93]Because we do have a lot of bits to go over.
[441:50.78]But that was Stuntmate Ignition.
[441:51.82]It was a lot of fun.
[441:52.92]That was equal parts hilarious, challenging, interesting.
[441:59.25]That was awesome.
[442:01.71]I'm really glad I played it.
[442:06.70]There is one more thing to look at.
[442:09.14]Behind the scenes.
[442:10.88]Cars World Stunt Awards Movie.
[442:14.13]I unlocked this.
[442:14.75]What is it?
[442:28.38]Did our that's Arnold did all that.
[442:32.37]Oh, is he alright?
[442:33.03]Oh
[442:54.00]I can't handle this anymore.
[442:59.10]Look at how high up he is.
[443:04.98]That's like 5,000 feet in the air.
[443:11.72]It would have taken like a full minute for him to fall.
[443:15.48]Alright, I'm out of here.
[443:21.26]Let's go play some Mario Yahtzee.
[443:25.71]My stomach's fucking killing me.
[443:28.49]Alright, give me a second while I switch over.
[443:33.21]If you're taking off, we'll see you later.
[443:35.59]You will see me again on... probably... probably Thursday.
[443:42.72]I have a lot of stuff to do over the next two or three days, so you'll see me again on Thursday.
[443:51.90]I have a very, very, very interesting stream on probably Saturday.
[444:00.02]We'll go Thursday, Friday, Saturday this week.
[444:03.84]Saturday will be the movies, the you kind of star in the movies stream.
[444:08.68]Not, it's not the same game as it was before.
[444:12.42]This is completely different.
[444:13.35]I had to buy a 360 for this.
[444:16.73]This is a full-on obscure-ass game.
[444:20.93]I didn't even know this existed.
[444:23.95]It's called You're in the Movies.
[444:27.27]It is a bootleg version, essentially, of You Star.
[444:31.92]We'll see how that goes.
[444:32.82]Apparently there's like 60 minigames to play and you make a movie while you play the minigames.
[444:36.76]I don't know.
[444:37.16]But that's what we're going to do on Saturday.
[444:42.89]I have that?
[444:43.53]You have that?
[444:45.25]Well, we'll see how good it is.
[444:48.77]But if you've taken off, see you later.
[444:50.15]We'll see you Thursday.
[444:50.81]And if not, then we'll play some Yahtzee and go over the bits.
[444:56.54]Stay tuned.
[444:57.34]I'll be right back.
