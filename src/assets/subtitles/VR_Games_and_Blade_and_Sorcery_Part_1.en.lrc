[00:00.56]Can you fucking guys see me?
[00:01.56]Am I live?
[00:08.56]Hello?
[00:08.84]What the fuck's happening?
[00:20.66]Alright, that's really weird.
[00:25.44]My stream key.
[00:29.01]Something was fucking weird with my stream key.
[00:30.51]When I was doing testing, remember earlier, like an hour ago, and I was doing like a test to make sure we could stream at the same time?
[00:36.99]I got a stream key issue there.
[00:38.39]That was fucking weird.
[00:40.83]But anyways, hold on a minute.
[00:42.89]Hey, let's do the, just pretend I'm not here for a second.
[02:08.76]Alright, so I think I'm ready.
[02:13.31]I think I'm ready to play.
[02:16.55]I should be good to go.
[02:18.75]Let's just make sure that you can see that.
[02:22.31]And you can.
[02:23.05]Alright, okay.
[02:23.81]We're getting there.
[02:24.65]I have a little cropping issue over here with my OpenVR.
[02:35.12]Is it
[02:37.13]Wait, what's this giant warning?
[02:39.83]If the control buttons don't work, please check the game windows.
[02:43.25]What?
[02:47.58]How do I get rid of this little fucking thing on the bottom left?
[02:56.26]Oh, I got it.
[03:02.63]Almost there.
[03:06.03]Looking good.
[03:12.72]Door exposed.
[03:13.80]What do you mean door exposed?
[03:17.83]Door exposed.
[03:20.93]Oh, hi, guys.
[03:21.65]How are you?
[03:22.13]Welcome to the stream.
[03:26.17]I think that's good.
[03:27.01]No, hold on a second.
[03:33.72]So today, as you didn't know by the point I did, we're doing VR tonight.
[03:42.93]Is that better?
[03:46.89]Well, we're going to do a test.
[03:48.13]Are you ready?
[03:49.44]Here's the test, because I couldn't really tell from before.
[03:53.34]I'm going to blow your eardrums.
[04:12.54]Okay, so you guys need to tell me.
[04:17.78]So I'm in, okay?
[04:20.22]So I had the chat program thing where you go like this and see the chat, but I couldn't get it to fucking work.
[04:25.54]I tried so hard, and I'm going to get that ready for tomorrow.
[04:28.17]But for today, how does it sound?
[04:30.63]Does it sound like shit?
[04:33.47]Why is it that way?
[04:37.47]Why is the game that way?
[04:46.35]Why is the game that way?
[04:51.65]I'm peaking the mic?
[04:52.39]Alright, what about now?
[05:00.64]Desync low quality.
[05:02.22]It's desynced?
[05:05.56]Wait, wait, wait.
[05:06.30]Colin, ready?
[05:07.14]What do you hear?
[05:09.74]Do you hear the clap first or do you hear the clap after?
[05:12.21]After.
[05:19.12]Alright, hold on.
[05:27.97]Hold on.
[05:35.45]How's that?
[05:36.01]Can you still hear me?
[05:37.31]Are we good?
[05:38.03]Is that better?
[05:38.47]It's going to be desynced, but I couldn't tell.
[05:40.55]Hold on, let me move this shit.
[05:44.71]Hold on, sorry.
[05:45.51]Block your ears.
[05:53.02]I'm just like grabbing onto your ears.
[05:55.80]So, so that's better.
[05:56.66]So this is fine.
[05:57.66]You guys ever okay with this?
[05:58.50]Let's try some tests here.
[06:00.34]Are we synced?
[06:02.18]Why the fuck is the game behind me?
[06:04.97]I did like the point to your monitor this way.
[06:06.87]So there's still desync.
[06:12.13]Let me try this.
[06:16.27]That's fucking weird.
[06:17.03]A lot of weird shit.
[06:17.97]Oh, god damn it.
[06:18.93]Of course there's a desync.
[06:21.27]Stupid fucking- I was playing PlayStation 3 yesterday.
[06:23.87]Everything's fine now.
[06:30.56]Okay, so... Here we go.
[06:33.04]Look, I got my controllers here.
[06:34.22]I went like that.
[06:35.92]Like, I pointed this way to the monitors.
[06:37.68]Should I just recalibrate and point that way?
[06:44.09]So I'm just going to recalibrate.
[06:45.05]I'm just going to point the controller this way.
[06:52.51]I'm going to try that.
[06:54.03]What the fuck?
[06:57.28]Alright, let's do room setup.
[07:02.56]What's happening?
[07:04.00]What the hell is that on the... Oh.
[07:07.62]Please take off the headset and follow the... You got it.
[07:09.83]Okay, hold on a second here, guys.
[07:12.63]Alright.
[07:17.69]This will only take a second.
[07:20.53]Alright, turn the controls, place the controls, I just, I did this like three times.
[07:25.07]Why if I point this way at my screen?
[07:28.61]Fucking Valve.
[07:31.04]Locate your monitor.
[07:32.62]Okay, let me locate the monitor real quick.
[07:38.80]Found it.
[07:43.16]Well, I know where the floor is, I sure as hell know where that is, it's right here.
[07:52.42]And there's the floor.
[07:55.18]Okay.
[07:55.50]Now I'm gonna measure, I'm gonna do like the doop doop doop doop doop.
[07:59.84]Here we go.
[08:06.97]I did this shit like five times already.
[08:15.31]I wanted to be like prepared for the VR streams.
[08:18.39]But you never are.
[08:19.89]They expect somebody to fucking buy this?
[08:22.27]You think, like, grandma's gonna play this game?
[08:27.54]Okay, there we are.
[08:29.12]Let's go.
[08:29.50]Uh, your minimum play area is not big enough.
[08:41.81]I just- it was- what- what happened?
[08:43.29]Is it because my monitor's over here now?
[08:46.43]Is that the problem?
[08:49.11]My monitor changed its positions and therefore I don't have enough room to play?
[08:52.25]Fucking virtual reality.
[09:00.74]Give me a goddamn Super Nintendo any day of the week.
[09:14.87]Okay.
[09:15.19]Okay, there we go.
[09:17.37]Play area has been selected.
[09:21.19]Your play area has been selected.
[09:24.86]Done.

[09:27.26]Alright, here we go.
[09:28.22]I'm ready.
[09:29.66]Can you guys hear the game?
[09:33.26]Alright, here we go.
[09:36.69]Alright, I'm going to open the game again.
[09:48.24]What the hell is over there?
[09:52.68]No game, no sound.
[09:53.82]No game, no sound.
[09:56.22]Here it comes.

[10:01.21]What are you doing?
[10:01.99]What the fuck is that?
[10:03.61]Why is that on the screen?
[10:06.59]Why is that on the screen?
[10:08.65]I'm not even in that game.
[10:09.93]I'm not even in this game.
[10:20.74]Fuck, give me a goddamn Super Nintendo.
[10:23.87]I'll take Donkey Kong Country 2.

[10:53.41]I think that's it, right?
[10:54.29]Yup.
[10:55.81]So I just want to make sure we're really clear on this, guys.

[11:06.82]I pointed that way.
[11:09.17]It fixed it.
[11:09.81]Technology sucks.
[11:11.77]Let's go back to fucking books.
[11:12.99]Alright, I'm going in.

[12:15.19]I don't give a fuck.
[12:27.98]Until somebody figures it- there's gotta be like a drink can thing that comes down.
[12:30.57]How are you supposed to hydrate?
[12:38.95]That's on the, uh... That's mono sound in VR.
[12:45.47]I can't do it man, I'll throw up.
[12:47.36]Alright, I'm getting to my zone, here.
[12:49.90]I've made it to the zone, the play area.
[12:53.00]And I'm ready to fucking go nuts.
[12:54.91]I'm gonna turn the game down a little.
[12:59.75]Alright.
[13:01.21]I'm getting in the zone.
[13:02.15]I gotta put these down first so I can get in comfortably.
[13:03.93]I don't like this fucking giant cable.
[13:06.71]How much is the wireless thing?
[13:08.07]300 bucks?
[13:14.42]Fuck off, man.

[13:18.30]I have a giant rat tail that's weighing me down.
[13:20.52]I've never even put it on.
[13:22.52]I wanted it to be blind.
[13:31.27]I adjusted.
[13:33.67]I put the head on, but I didn't put the rat tail on.
[13:36.21]Alright guys, I'm fucking ready to go.
[13:38.69]Where are my hands?
[13:40.33]I'm supposed to be able to see my hands in VR.
[13:42.50]Where are they?
[13:48.70]Alright, let's do it!
[14:03.46]Something happened in here that I'm not necessarily aware of.
[14:12.31]Okay, I think... Okay, I got it.
[14:15.51]I got it.
[14:15.79]My hands... Why?
[14:21.44]You need like fucking four people.
[14:23.12]You gotta hire like three people to help you get into a game.
[14:26.32]Alright, I'm ready.
[14:29.08]It's nice and snug.
[14:30.18]It looks good.

[14:51.25]Okay.
[15:00.41]Okay guys, welcome to my VR, uh, attempt here to try VR for the first time.
[15:05.42]Uh, at least in the Steam version of VR, which I've heard is quite fun and quite interesting.
[15:10.22]We're gonna play this game called Blade & Sorcery.
[15:12.84]Came out, um, probably a couple years ago, but I never had a chance to play it.
[15:16.48]Let's go ahead and create our character.
[15:21.24]It's like got this, what, wait, why is it giving me like a little cube indicator?
[15:25.42]Get out of here!
[15:27.02]I know that I can't go that far.

[16:27.35]Eye rotation.
[16:30.65]Mouth size Is this doing anything
[17:04.57]Okay, I gave him a Mickey Mouse nose.
[17:18.45]Somebody just, like, punched into his face.

[17:27.95]Let's go with, uh, glutes.
[17:30.27]Oh, the glutes.
[17:30.71]Glutes.
[17:36.38]I just heard my computer make a loud click sound.
[17:41.46]I don't know if that's good or not.
[17:42.62]Am I still alive?
[17:43.78]Did my computer, did my motherboard just, like, fry?
[17:47.89]Did I just fry my motherboard?
[17:49.25]I don't know.
[17:50.91]I don't know, because I can't see!
[17:52.27]Who said that?
[17:56.17]I'm like... He's got, like, he's got skin-colored football pads on.
[18:06.54]This is like a joke.
[18:07.47]He went to the party store and got this put on.
[18:09.17]Oh, wait.
[18:17.57]Hold on.
[18:23.18]That's too tall.
[18:24.18]You gotta be smaller than that.

[18:31.34]I'm ready.
[18:32.46]Alright.
[18:33.62]Select this character.
[18:35.37]I've got...
[18:39.39]Is this play area too small?
[18:40.92]Am I going to get yelled at for this every time?
[18:43.48]Can you guys see these bars?
[18:45.52]Can you see these bars?
[18:53.48]I might have to like sit down in a chair and just change it.
[18:56.01]I thought it told me I had enough room.
[19:00.43]Okay.
[19:01.17]Select.
[19:03.91]Calibrate.
[19:04.49]Please stand up, look straight, and click calibrate to set.

[19:24.26]Okay, let's play the game.
[19:25.55]I can't wait.
[19:27.65]Oh my god.
[19:28.51]What the fuck?
[19:36.65]Look at you.
[19:39.57]I've never experienced something that fucking ridiculous before in my life.
[19:43.72]Like, in my whole life.
[19:59.21]That's fucking so funny.
[20:00.53]Okay, so I move around like, how do I move around?
[20:04.39]Did you know, I can't read any of that.
[20:06.24]I have no idea what the fuck that says.
[20:09.64]Did you know you can sheath up to four objects?
[20:13.44]Do I have to walk there?
[20:25.60]Okay, this is actually important because I will walk into a fucking wall.
[20:28.96]I will actually hurt myself.
[20:30.08]So if it's good that I did this, it's here.
[20:35.90]How do I move?
[20:44.81]I don't know.
[20:45.23]How do I move?
[20:59.42]Okay, that's fucking weird.
[21:00.40]I'm sorry.
[21:00.76]Oh you can jump?
[21:09.15]I don't like doing that.
[21:09.97]It's too fast.
[21:10.87]How do I go slower?
[21:17.03]Okay, I'm starting to figure it out.
[21:18.23]Let's see.
[21:19.09]You can sheathe up to four objects and weapons on your
[21:23.13]You can sheath up to four objects slash weapons on you by dropping them over your left or right shoulder.
[21:28.68]What?
[21:31.18]What?
[21:32.64]So you can sheath up to four weapons by dropping them over your shoulder?
[21:40.02]Or on each side of your hips?
[21:44.88]How close am I to this wall?
[21:49.39]Okay, um...
[21:51.62]You can practice this by looking at yourself in the mirror in the home.
[21:55.26]Be aware that some objects are restricted to hips or back only.
[22:02.27]How do I, like, turn around again?
[22:03.71]Okay, there it is.
[22:05.15]Alright, that kind of makes me want to die doing that, though, too often.
[22:11.63]Alright, cool, so I practice a sword.
[22:16.31]How do I grab it?
[22:20.62]How do I get the sword?
[22:23.33]Sword, yeah, I wanna grab it with like, which button?

[27:49.79]The ruins.
[27:51.52]Oh, okay.
[27:52.52]These ruins have been known to protect a mysterious cult practicing dark magic and human sacrifice.
[27:58.30]Make them pay for their crimes.
[27:59.54]Am I facing the right way?
[28:03.47]I'm so disorientated.
[28:10.23]I'm ready.
[28:17.63]I have to like move, otherwise it feels weird standing doing this.
[28:36.40]Is this gonna kill me if I let it go?
[28:39.62]No.
[28:42.88]That's fine.
[28:43.36]Alright, well we don't need that right now.
[28:44.64]This is probably a puzzle that I'm gonna have to do later.
[28:48.91]Can I just, like, can I just hit shit?
[28:51.75]Where's the distance?
[28:52.33]Right, like, here.
[29:02.12]This is the most fun thing I've ever done.
[29:03.82]I'm serious.
[29:05.78]I'm serious.
[29:06.08]This is the funnest thing I've ever done in my whole life.
[29:09.20]I've been to Disney World.
[29:10.23]I've rode roller coasters before.
[29:12.35]I've had teeth pulled.
[29:18.32]Very easy, wave one.
[29:20.52]What's it gonna do?
[29:22.22]Here, put this away for a second.
[29:36.41]Okay.
[29:38.13]Alright, we got very easy.
[29:39.41]I just needed to know how to play the game.
[29:41.63]Start it.
[29:42.63]Fight in progress.
[29:51.04]Oh God.
[29:51.44]Oh my God.
[30:02.03]Oh, he just hit my hand.
[30:33.78]Gotta make sure he's dead.
[30:45.93]I wanna two-hand this.
[30:51.13]Ow!
[30:52.89]I went the wrong way.
[30:59.64]Ah, I dropped it!
[31:53.05]What do we got?
[31:57.43]What is this, a stick?
[32:03.92]Go with the legs, always.
[32:10.70]That works.
[32:28.36]Holy shit, why am I flying?
[32:41.56]We got another one?
[32:42.50]Two more?
[32:46.94]Get in the low center of gravity!
[32:54.80]This fucking room scale!
[33:06.49]But here, earbuds fell out.
[33:16.20]How do I pause the game?
[33:17.10]How do I pause VR?
[33:17.82]I don't have any sound!
[33:46.79]Cut him in half!
[33:53.55]Ow!
[34:03.80]I'm gonna lie on my fucking, like, resume here.
[34:06.34]I'm gonna lie on my SATs.
[34:07.36]That was fun.
[34:10.82]Where the fuck am I?
[34:17.94]I'm going to redo the room scale calibration and pretend the room is bigger.
[34:21.16]There's a coffee after that one.
[34:36.56]Put on the straps.
[34:37.32]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[34:43.84]I forgot I got to put the straps on.
[34:46.99]Alright, is the room scale thing annoying, or is that okay?
[34:49.57]Is that, like, not irritating to look at?
[34:52.15]Because, like, I could just fake it.
[34:53.39]I'm not going to hit the fucking wall.
[35:00.40]Alright, that's on.
[35:02.98]It's fine?
[35:03.32]It's fine?
[35:03.66]Okay.
[35:04.34]Alright, just making sure it's not, like, annoying to see.
[35:09.50]Move your arms in a walking motion to move instead.
[35:13.26]Really?
[35:18.15]You can make it feel less intrusive in the settings, really.
[35:24.66]Just like the SteamVR settings.
[35:26.24]Hold on, let me just see.
[35:27.90]It's like crushing my eye.
[35:30.86]So let me see here.
[35:32.00]I got the SteamVR right here.
[35:33.76]Settings.
[35:38.28]Let's put this up.
[35:41.02]Night mode.
[35:42.94]Locked mode.
[35:45.02]D&D.
[35:49.83]Suppress warnings and alerts when Steam's DR status is minimized.
[35:53.62]It's in the VR settings.
[35:54.80]Yeah, I'm in the VR settings right now.
[35:58.44]That was so much fucking fun.
[36:06.50]No, with your headset on.
[36:09.87]It's the settings while in VR.
[36:11.87]Oh, okay.
[36:14.89]So do I have to go...
[36:17.83]Is there a way I can get to the SteamVR menu?
[36:26.74]It's the button on the side of the headset.
[36:29.49]It's the thing that I pressed before.
[36:31.91]Whoa!
[36:34.65]I gotta recalibrate.
[36:36.11]Recalibrate!
[36:37.93]Uh-oh.
[36:45.87]and then it's the settings in here.
[36:49.23]What the fuck is this button?
[36:54.24]I pressed it accidentally before and now I can't like find the damn thing.
[37:02.02]There it is, okay.
[37:03.68]So, settings, right?
[37:11.23]Stream, okay.
[37:12.77]Night mode, do not disturb.
[37:14.67]It's the chaperone.
[37:16.18]Chaperone bounds opacity.
[37:19.08]Bring it down.
[37:21.48]Okay.
[37:21.74]That's better.
[37:22.14]Alright.
[37:24.21]That's cool.
[37:24.95]Good.
[37:27.33]Intermediate.
[37:28.35]What's that mean?
[37:30.13]Alright.
[37:30.59]Squares.
[37:32.01]Advanced.
[37:34.74]Developer.
[37:36.34]Developer.
[37:38.11]Oh, okay.
[37:38.45]So that makes him go away completely.
[37:40.41]I don't know if I want to do that because that's actually probably dangerous.
[37:43.05]I'll probably get hurt.
[37:44.25]But maybe I don't give a fuck.
[37:45.37]We'll see.
[37:45.71]We'll see how annoying it is.
[37:51.96]Alright, let's keep going.
[37:54.40]I'm going to put both headphones in so he can't hear us.
[37:57.46]You know what I mean?
[37:58.40]He can't hear us!
[38:02.14]I'm so sweaty already.
[38:06.64]Yeah, that's much better.
[38:07.56]Alright, so I need to like, how do I like recalibrate this?
[38:12.97]This is not right at all.
[38:38.51]I might have to back to app.
[38:44.93]What did I do fucking wrong?
[38:48.17]Click window on desktop.
[38:51.71]Holy fuck.
[38:54.55]Alright, we're good.
[38:55.95]Alright, let's get back in one more sip of coffee and we're going to do the next, we're going to do a harder wave, I think.
[39:10.54]Let me get my fucking earphones back in.
[39:16.48]What a... I'm so glad somebody actually made this game.
[39:22.64]No.
[39:23.14]Stop doing that.
[39:28.63]Respell?
[39:29.55]Respell.
[39:30.31]Respell.
[39:31.31]Respell.
[39:32.79]Respell.
[39:34.63]I don't know what spell I did.
[39:35.61]Okay, let's get this back on.
[39:39.27]Alright, let's go.
[39:42.38]Free spell.
[39:45.71]Okay.
[39:45.97]There's my sword, right?
[39:47.21]Alright.
[39:51.93]Let's get this back and put it back where I wanted it.
[39:55.32]Turn it around here.
[39:57.22]They had some cool weapons, though.
[39:58.14]Let me see what they had.
[40:07.15]Some kind of stick.
[40:13.48]Seems pretty good.
[40:14.02]I don't know if it's that good, though.
[40:24.99]Doesn't even break any bones.
[40:26.95]This thing sucks.
[40:29.09]Give me my... Oh, here we go.
[40:30.35]Here's a new weapon, right?
[40:34.32]Is this the same sword that I had before?
[40:36.94]Or is this different?
[40:44.62]Hold on a minute here.
[40:45.78]Fellas.
[40:50.45]Alright, who wants some pork?
[40:54.11]I'm ready for the next wave.
[41:01.09]Fight ended.
[41:01.89]Okay, return.
[41:05.09]Where's like the food game where you can like... I just want to get like... I don't care about... Is there a game with an onion?
[41:12.42]Is there an onion in this game?
[41:13.72]Or in any VR game where I get an onion and just be like... And then, fuck, I'll just like slide it into the pot.
[41:21.99]Alright, we'll do wave, uh, wave two.
[41:35.54]There we go, this guy's got... Jump over the rock, that would've been cool.
[41:50.36]Just wait till he swings, and then come in with a double.
[41:53.62]Just treat him like an onion.
[42:00.46]I gotta get off.
[42:06.98]What's on me?
[42:07.54]What the f- Why did I become the rock?
[42:09.88]Hello?
[42:11.58]What?
[42:16.92]Give me that sword back!
[42:28.76]Where?
[42:29.96]Where?
[42:31.48]Who the fuck is hitting me?
[42:49.63]You wanna get the fucking chef?
[42:52.83]Eat this, you fucking celery bitch!
[43:17.27]I'm wild!
[43:18.03]I'm like a caged fucking beast!
[43:23.04]I got both of you.
[43:24.38]Oh, would that hurt your hand?
[43:25.24]I'm sorry, ma'am.
[43:37.13]Fuck!
[43:37.87]Arrgh!
[43:40.11]What?
[43:41.45]Fucking fuck!
[43:42.13]Come on!
[43:42.91]Wait, how do I do anything?
[43:43.79]Can I grab?
[43:50.24]Oh my god, this is fucking a blast.
[43:58.19]I'm losing my mind.
[43:58.97]I don't even... I don't even have my Twitch dashboard on.
[44:04.45]Sweat check?
[44:05.37]It's gonna get bad here in about like 20 minutes.
[44:09.11]You can throw weapons?
[44:11.99]How do I throw a weapon?
[44:18.28]Hold trigger while using telekinesis.
[44:19.96]Okay.
[44:26.32]It's the relevant controller.
[44:29.00]Drink water, don't drink coffee.
[44:30.72]I got plenty of fucking hydration with that coffee.
[44:33.73]But how do I have, like, hair in my mouth?
[44:39.19]No, stop it.
[44:40.61]Alright, Steam, I'm gonna give you a fucking design choice here that I would change if I were you.
[44:46.41]Don't have the button be here, have the button be like up here somewhere.
[44:51.01]Like up here.
[44:51.81]Because like everybody puts it on like this.
[44:56.56]Or at least I do, so change it for me!
[44:58.80]Okay, let's keep going.
[45:01.50]That was fucking- I love this game.
[45:06.49]So let me get this straight.
[45:12.37]Can I like throw a weapon?
[45:17.15]If I, like, let go of this... That didn't really work.
[45:25.68]So, but like this... With the force power... Just kind of... When I hit trigger, it kind of comes back to me.
[45:40.99]So if I hold trigger and then do it... Hold trigger and, like... I'm holding them both at the same time.
[45:49.76]That was fucking cool.
[45:54.90]Hold and release when you throw it.
[45:56.02]No, that's what I was doing.
[45:57.04]I was holding the trigger down and then letting go.
[46:01.82]Not the trigger.
[46:08.50]It's like this grip button.
[46:10.63]That's how you pull it up, right?
[46:15.51]I do have, like, spells, too.
[46:17.07]Hold on.
[46:17.27]Let me do some, like, fucking fun tinkering here.
[46:22.54]So, walk over here.
[46:25.02]I gotta... It's forced right now.
[46:26.50]So if I hold the grip button down... There we go.
[46:30.40]Okay.
[46:30.98]So it's the grip button.
[46:31.80]It's not the trigger button.
[46:33.48]Cool.
[46:34.14]Let me just play around.
[46:34.88]I have spells, too, apparently.
[46:37.91]So, how do I do a spell?
[46:39.19]Okay, holding that jumps.
[46:43.69]This is walk.
[46:44.03]Walk.
[46:46.14]What is spells?
[46:48.72]That's the other grip.
[46:51.83]I had it up there before, didn't I?
[46:54.29]Maybe it's like the trigger and grip?
[46:57.79]Hmm.
[46:59.51]I didn't even know that existed.
[47:06.18]What about down?
[47:07.28]Does down do anything on the, uh... Okay, that doesn't hurt me.
[47:12.66]Just wanted to make sure.
[47:16.96]Let's get that wave going again.
[47:20.86]Oh, is it a spear?
[47:22.50]Hold on, I gotta, oh, come on, let me, of course I can use the spear, put this back.
[47:29.71]And it's a spear and a shield.
[47:31.75]Thank you very much.
[47:38.05]Oh, this is, okay, now this is what I, this is fucking awesome.
[47:42.49]I can just be a fucking turtle dickhead and just be like this.
[47:47.35]You know what I mean?
[47:48.77]I could be like the... What's the famous group of actors that, like, took on the... Took on the... The Persians... The Spartans!
[48:00.87]Alright, I'm gonna do... I wanna do Spartan.
[48:02.90]Let's start it.
[48:03.34]I'm just gonna... This is gonna be great.
[48:16.30]Jesus.
[48:19.14]Use touchpad or thumbpad stick to scroll up or down.
[48:23.57]Use select a wave to begin.
[48:24.87]Yeah.
[48:26.97]Okay.
[48:30.81]Let's go.
[48:35.18]And let them know that 300 spots.
[48:40.70]Hoo hoo!
[48:50.77]That's right, that's what you do.
[48:51.83]Remember they make the big wall?
[48:52.87]Right in his neck.
[49:04.19]Get out of my town!
[49:39.99]They could give me like fucking 50 people, it doesn't even matter.
[49:42.03]And it's starting to hurt my back.
[49:57.79]Get out of here!
[50:27.65]Get off of me!
[50:28.82]Oh, you wanna play that way?
[50:39.69]Come on, come on!
[50:43.19]Damn it!
[50:46.53]Oh, sorry.
[50:49.04]That was desirable.
[51:06.29]I think I got him.
[51:15.78]What's going on?
[51:16.28]Alright, let's go.
[51:19.00]I like this setup.
[51:23.49]Wave three on very easy.
[51:27.11]Begin.
[51:36.31]Alright, guy up top.
[51:42.29]My hands are covered in water.
[51:47.45]Well, you got the same strategy, but you didn't protect your legs!
[51:49.49]You didn't think I was gonna saw them!
[52:05.93]She's not dead.
[52:13.67]Told ya.
[52:14.24]Told ya.
[52:30.48]Sorry, I'm being like silent.
[52:31.67]I have to.
[52:35.28]Get behind me!
[52:39.56]Come on, like a movie!
[52:40.48]Oops!
[53:02.76]Something's in my eye.
[53:03.60]How?
[53:04.40]Did, like, piece of glass go in my eye?
[53:11.08]Can I just get close enough to do, like, the sweep?
[53:16.40]Now die!
[53:23.90]Who's hitting me?
[53:24.96]I don't know.
[53:26.12]I don't know who just hit me.
[53:28.05]How do I do the health potion?
[53:32.50]Oh, shit.
[53:47.71]I need a different weapon.
[54:02.33]Where's my dagger?
[54:03.71]Where's my dagger?
[54:17.35]You're not gonna fucking do that to me now, are ya?
[54:20.99]Never fuck with a guy with a spear.
[54:31.59]Just take Captain America.
[54:34.63]I went.
[54:43.20]Let me get this straight.
[54:45.88]So... Can I, like... I want to hold this from a different angle.
[54:57.66]I'm letting it go.
[55:01.02]Holy shit.
[55:03.05]I gotta do that to somebody.
[55:03.81]This is like a... This is going right through somebody's head.
[55:27.01]This is def... Oh, this is so worth it.
[55:30.24]If you haven't played VR and you're thinking about getting a Vive, this game is $20, I think.
[55:35.11]Holy shit.
[55:37.61]Alright, I need to get some backup weapons.
[55:41.11]I need to figure out how to do spells.
[55:45.61]Alright.
[55:46.69]Let me come up for a second.
[55:52.82]How much is the Vive?
[55:53.60]It's $4.99.
[55:56.38]there are better games for free I just I'm just getting a taste you know I'm just getting a sample four dollars and 99 cents no so I click in the touchpad I was clicking the touchpad on the right or the left
[56:26.24]With telekinesis you can- oh god, it's going too fast.
[56:30.88]Is there like a menu I can look at?
[56:37.70]You can grab people.
[56:41.45]Just pause and go to help.
[56:42.43]Yeah, I'll just look at it now.
[56:46.97]Let's see what we got here.
[56:47.79]I mean, is there- oh god, it's so hard to get back in once you're out.
[56:53.17]Hold on, is it gonna- I'm gonna look like a fucking psycho, but I gotta-
[56:55.82]Move my hair.
[56:58.98]Holy.
[56:59.42]Let's take a look.
[57:07.46]I just broke out of a coffin.
[57:09.92]You know what I mean?
[57:10.67]I'm not supposed to be alive right now.
[57:12.45]I just broke out of a... They buried me like two weeks ago.
[57:16.79]And I got out.
[57:17.93]I wasn't supposed to be in there.
[57:18.83]I'm still alive.
[57:21.11]Ugh.
[57:22.90]There's like already like grease on this thing.
[57:25.38]Fuck me.
[57:26.20]I can't hold it.
[57:26.64]Don't look my shirt up.
[57:30.34]I've already got like face grease on here.
[57:32.38]My shirt just got like a buzz cut.
[57:38.93]Alright.
[57:45.17]Oh, I'm going to be losing hair in the front of this head.
[57:49.13]You bet you I will.
[57:52.84]Alright, let me try to get back in here.
[57:59.01]Is there like a wet wipe I could get for the Vive?
[58:02.33]There's gotta be like Vive-specific wet wipes, right?
[58:17.46]Somebody's gonna make them.
[58:19.96]Alright, something's not right here.
[58:22.40]This is going to go back around.
[58:23.94]Alright, that's good.
[58:28.70]Okay.
[58:35.75]Alright, let's go take a look at some stuff here.
[58:40.27]Back it up.
[58:43.76]So on this table, there's a health potion here.
[59:07.49]That was delicious!
[59:16.75]Wait.
[59:26.31]I'm going dinner, man.
[59:27.41]Let's go.
[59:27.73]I'm gonna do another one.
[59:32.05]I'm just like drunk shit-faced guy at the bar.
[59:36.24]Alright, now we're going to go to... Wave 3 is this one.
[59:40.86]So, let's do... This is medium.
[59:44.73]Let's do... Let's do, like, wave... Let's just do wave 3.
[59:48.41]Let's just try it.
[59:49.43]Wave 2.
[59:49.71]Alright, let's see if I can't fucking do something cool here.
[60:03.31]Didn't somebody say if I move my hands, I walk...
[60:15.92]I should have a gesture!
[60:24.99]What the fuck?
[60:35.59]Come on!
[60:38.32]What was I doing?
[60:41.74]I was... I was grabbing him by the shoulder?
[60:54.18]Okay, I just, like, did something there.
[61:05.87]It looks like when my hands are grasped... Okay, so when you grasp... Okay, I got it.
[61:26.56]So I have lightning on my hand right now.
[61:29.76]Is that so loud that you can't even fucking hear?
[61:32.44]It might be.
[61:38.97]I might have to lower the fucking volume.
[61:46.45]Okay.
[61:58.56]I need a team of actors to help me.
[62:02.48]I almost just fucking tripped.
[62:03.28]Alright, let's try the lightning.
[62:12.41]So it's grab, let go.
[62:14.97]So I have no spell here.
[62:16.37]So I have this one selected.
[62:21.13]So let's just try it.
[62:22.27]Okay.
[62:56.07]Oh my god, that's too much for me to handle.
[63:26.97]They're gonna do Diablo II-style necromancer.
[63:59.08]Oh my god, that was horrible!
[64:00.99]Don't let him do it!
[64:52.98]It's life or death.
[64:55.76]Which one, which one am I going?
[65:14.62]Give me the potion.
[65:24.55]Don't give them the potion, I'm like handing it to them.
[65:27.36]You idiot, you fucked it all up.
[65:34.08]No!
[65:36.12]Alright.
[65:50.16]That was pretty dramatic, I know.
[65:54.72]Grab, yeah, I gotta get used to the controllers, because it's kind of hard to, so for instance, when you like grab, like when I press these buttons here, it's like, and you kind of have to tilt your wrist a little, because I can't really do it with my pinky, it's like, it's hard to, I gotta get used to the Vive controller.
[66:17.85]So I'm gonna put, I'm gonna unstop that potion.
[66:27.71]My back is, like, fucked up now.
[66:30.59]I've had, like, back problems for a while.
[66:32.75]And I have no idea what the fuck is wrong with me.
[66:34.83]Alright, you stick in there.
[66:40.37]You just stay unstopped.
[66:42.93]For my drink later.
[66:45.35]Let's get this on my person here.
[66:47.11]Okay, I got two daggers.
[66:51.80]Let's get... Okay, let's try that again.
[67:00.22]I'm going to try to just work with this here.
[67:03.51]So, bingo.
[67:12.25]That's so fucking awesome.
[67:13.43]I need to, like, utilize... I've got to start this and get up here.
[67:16.61]Is there... Somebody said there's a bow.
[67:20.77]I have to crush everybody's head with a brick.
[67:23.30]Let me just take
[67:31.52]I got an axe.
[67:34.02]I like that.
[67:34.58]I don't think I picked it up.
[67:39.50]Alright, I like this one.
[67:40.24]This one's pretty fucking cool.
[67:43.80]Alright, I guess I... Okay.
[67:47.07]Yeah, let's replace this.
[67:55.77]Okay, just make sure it works.
[68:03.70]Okay.
[68:05.06]Any more items that I need to be made aware of?
[68:06.58]Let's take a look up the top.
[68:14.86]That's so interesting.
[68:15.86]Cool.
[68:18.46]Uh, that, that over there looks like it could be used.
[68:22.12]What are these, these oil barrels?
[68:25.27]Oh, fuck this.
[68:25.89]Just keep it here.
[68:26.43]I'm going to be throwing these at people.
[68:28.51]Oh my god, this is perfect.
[68:29.45]Why wouldn't I come up here before?
[68:32.75]Is it fall damage?
[68:36.56]No.
[68:38.10]Alright, I'm gonna go for like the throw shit if people take me.
[68:41.22]I'm gonna bring a potion with me up there.

[68:48.24]What the hell?
[68:48.82]Why?
[68:49.00]Who's hitting me?
[68:49.52]Why?

[70:57.96]Just you wait and see.
[70:59.08]Fuck potions.

[72:00.24]What item is this?
[72:01.88]Get off.
[72:03.30]Close the book.
[72:03.94]I'm reading a book in the middle of a fight.
[72:05.90]How could we get back on the right track?
[72:41.84]No, it's spilling!
[72:47.26]What is it, electricity?
[72:50.37]I was like, am I standing in a puddle?
[72:55.91]Get off my sword!
[73:02.92]Oh, fucking god damn it.
[73:08.94]This is fucking so much fun.
[73:16.29]I was like, what, am I standing in electricity?
[73:31.71]Absolute psycho.
[73:33.01]I'm fighting for my life.
[73:34.91]I'm fighting for my life here.
[73:38.49]I had a better tactic when I had this shield in the...
[73:43.26]And the spear.
[73:47.39]I'm actually, we're gonna go easy.
[73:49.35]Like, really, really easy.
[73:52.01]Because... God, I haven't even, like, grabbed the tip of the iceberg, have I?
[73:57.42]This is fucking, this is so much fun.
[74:01.56]What a broken record I am tonight about that.
[74:03.26]But, my God, this is so much different than the PSVR.
[74:05.87]It's, like, unbelievable.
[74:10.21]Does my stomach look fat?
[74:11.99]I mean, like, not in the game, but me?
[74:13.95]It probably does.
[74:14.49]I want to try... I want to try just simply... So, I want to just grab this person.
[74:24.71]I'm just going to try to learn it.
[74:27.75]So, we got... Okay, you're here.
[74:38.27]Okay, so you hold this button.
[74:41.26]Do I actually have to hold it, though?
[74:43.88]Yeah, you do.
[74:44.38]So I gotta hold down the grip, and then... So you can do that.
[75:03.08]I can't!
[75:03.82]How do I do this?! !
[75:32.85]What?
[75:33.84]What?
[75:34.58]This is too... Like, what?
[75:37.04]This is not how... This is not alright!
[75:39.85]It's not alright to, like, let kids do this!
[76:08.55]Alright, I got it.
[76:09.61]You gotta hold the grips down.
[76:10.87]I was just taunting.
[76:15.19]Look who I have.
[76:15.83]I have one of your comrades.
[76:18.42]Alright, let's try that again.
[76:19.70]I almost just fell backwards.
[76:25.26]Not because I'm winded, but because I almost just fell over because I'm moving around too much.
[76:29.46]Alright, let's go back to my bread and butter.
[76:34.65]I have to...

[77:23.92]I can't, like, drink that out of the mug.
[77:38.28]Oh, that feels like... Just that alone.
[77:43.69]Let's put that away.
[77:50.47]What's in here?
[77:52.60]Oh.
[77:56.72]I gotta hit somebody in the fucking head with a chair.
[77:58.74]Like, that's... Yeah, I mean... Give me the... Where is it?

[78:47.33]Who will it be?
[78:51.36]Oh, hello man.
[79:08.62]What?
[79:08.84]Did I catch the arrow?
[79:10.00]I think I just caught the arrow out of the air.
[79:22.54]It's too much fun to just experiment.
[79:24.10]Alright, I'm going for the real deal now.
[79:27.14]I caught the fucking arrow out of the air.
[79:29.82]Alright, give me my shit.
[79:44.16]Let's do it.
[79:45.12]This is what I had the most success with my setup with the protection and complete offense.
[79:53.03]My always-on offense.
[80:01.70]Let's go.
[80:25.64]Get out of here.
[80:26.18]Where the fuck did you come from?
[80:30.75]What?
[80:31.39]You picked a bad place to spawn.
[81:34.19]Come on!
[81:42.13]It's just getting like a water fountain.
[81:49.18]Pick up the dagger!
[82:06.39]I'm getting close to the wall.
[82:17.22]I gotta be careful.
[82:32.59]No!
[82:43.87]Come here, come here.
[83:16.66]Does nobody have anything?
[83:17.99]What?
[83:31.19]I'm stuck!
[83:35.52]I'm wrapped up!
[83:36.42]I'm stuck!
[83:37.62]It's actually wrapped around my whole leg.
[84:39.47]He put a target up for me.
[84:43.40]And I hit it with extreme precision.
[84:45.94]Alright, I gotta, I gotta, hold on a second here.
[84:48.36]This is on my leg.
[84:49.10]I can't, I don't know if I can show you this.
[84:51.86]Can you guys see this?
[84:53.54]No you can't, it's wrapped around, it's like a snake around my leg.
[84:58.42]How the fuck am I gonna get out of here?
[84:59.44]I have to just turn this way.
[85:02.31]Whoa.
[85:05.69]Is it helping?
[85:12.08]Okay, I think that's better.
[85:13.12]That's good.
[85:13.44]Let's get it out of the way now.
[85:16.83]The bow and arrow is fucking fun.
[85:17.83]Alright, let me just come out for a minute.
[85:31.82]Push the menu button for slow-mo.
[85:34.60]There's a slow-motion button.
[85:36.06]Nice shirt.
[85:37.14]It's coming through the shirt.
[85:45.96]Okay, so let me tell you a few things, right?
[85:47.56]A couple of important things.
[85:50.19]You know when like they have the VR set up at the convention and they're like, hey man, you want to check out the VR?
[85:57.73]It's only gonna take like 20 minutes.
[85:58.77]Like, yeah, yeah, sure.
[86:02.31]No, that's why I always decline.
[86:04.03]Because I end up like this and I have to go home.
[86:07.86]Like, I gotta go back to the hotel after like being in there for like 40 minutes.
[86:18.79]Check the face.
[86:19.37]Alright, hold on.
[86:25.49]Let me go grab some water.
[86:28.39]Have I ever been in here for an hour and a half?
[86:30.96]Holy fuck.
[86:31.38]Alright, let's check.
[86:39.96]I'm gonna do like one or two more of these and we'll go on to the next thing.
[86:43.94]What is on my face?
[86:47.39]You look like a homeless guy.
[86:50.73]I need to go look in the mirror and see how fucking bad this looks.
[86:54.37]Alright, give me a sec.
[87:05.14]What is on my... What is on my face?
[87:19.99]Why is that coming off on me?
[87:25.50]Is this poisonous?
[87:29.32]This is... This is from the fucking... What?
[87:32.46]Do I have acid sweat?
[87:34.57]Oh my god!
[87:37.67]This is from the foam here.
[87:41.49]It's from the foam in the visor.
[87:49.40]What?
[87:52.22]Are you fucking serious?
[87:59.50]Okay, well.
[88:04.32]I look fucked up.
[88:05.74]I look like, I look like the forward in a hockey game.
[88:09.27]I might as well like, oh yeah, let me take the break.
[88:12.85]I just got thrown out of the hockey game for fighting.
[88:16.99]I just beat the shit, we just got the shit kicked out of each other, me and whoever else it was that was in the hockey game.
[88:22.66]Oh my god.
[88:23.26]Alright, give me a second.
[88:24.06]I gotta like fucking clean my face up and figure out why the fuck that's happening.
[88:26.60]Alright, I'll be right back.
[92:24.13]Alright, it smells like Pop-Tarts in here.
[92:28.71]I don't know why.
[92:36.10]What is going on?
[92:36.94]Okay.
[92:39.18]I need to figure out how the fuck this is happening.
[92:45.32]So... I've wiped it off.
[92:50.34]But look, ready?
[92:50.94]So I've got a paper towel here.
[92:53.60]Clean paper towel.
[92:54.52]It's like I'm doing a magic trick.
[93:06.99]What the fuck is, why is it doing this?
[93:18.50]Is it just, is it, is that because it's, like, brand new?
[93:21.00]Or, I mean, like, that is very clearly, like, a bunch of shit coming off.
[93:30.08]I mean, I'm sweating in there.
[93:31.40]Like, not, like, crazy.
[93:32.58]I mean, like, maybe I am.
[93:39.52]Did I get, like, a defective model?
[93:42.07]Of course.
[93:42.61]I always get the fucking, like, defective one.
[93:45.31]That's weird.
[93:47.63]Uh...
[93:50.24]Did I do something wrong?
[93:57.28]That happened with mine, too.
[93:58.36]Oh, okay.
[94:01.04]Well, okay.
[94:02.86]I've said... There's like a... I swear to God there was like another piece.
[94:07.59]It's going to keep doing that to me.
[94:12.15]Did you put on the gamer socks?
[94:16.17]Hold on a minute.
[94:18.62]How hard is this gonna be to put on?
[94:19.98]I think I already have one.
[94:21.60]I think it comes with another thing to put on?
[94:25.00]But isn't this just a replacement?
[94:27.32]Hold on, do I need to put this on?
[94:41.69]No, no, this is for a narrow face.
[94:47.81]This is the same material.
[94:51.79]No, it's just, it's the same thing.
[94:54.05]Well, whatever.
[94:54.45]Alright.
[94:54.67]Let's see.
[94:55.23]I'm just going to have to like get, somebody said it looked like I got out of the chimney.
[95:03.00]Alright.
[95:03.60]I got my, I had my water and take the last little bit of coffee in here.
[95:06.70]We're gonna do this one more time.
[95:09.16]I'm going to try to kill somebody with a rock.
[95:11.98]I really want to kill someone with a rock, so I'm going to try.
[95:14.06]And then we're going to move on to probably Beat Saber.
[95:21.31]Either Beat Saber or... I've got like three things lined up for tonight.
[95:28.97]Each one will be about an hour or two each.
[95:31.75]Because like I told you guys before, after like three or four hours in this thing, I've got to go take a bath.
[95:36.84]You're seeing it in real time.
[95:37.72]I'm going to be horrible looking in like another hour or two.
[95:44.04]Alright.
[95:45.76]Let's get back in.
[95:48.34]Although make sure, because I, is that in the right spot?
[95:52.79]Because I had to move.
[95:54.95]No, I think it's good.
[95:56.15]I literally, I can't leave this room.
[95:59.43]And I have to move the lighthouse to get out of the room.
[96:02.92]I'm pissed off and annoyed that I don't have to get this warped paint shit on, whatever it is.
[96:09.78]Like the smears.
[96:12.69]Whatever.
[96:13.63]As long as it doesn't get in my hair.
[96:15.61]Which it definitely will.
[96:16.95]Let me get this untangled.
[96:18.93]This is so tangled.
[96:24.91]I must have spun around so many times here.
[96:35.63]All the way down here, too.
[96:36.79]God.
[96:39.65]I gotta, like, step on this and twist it.
[96:41.49]Hold on a second.
[96:44.47]Sorry.
[96:44.73]Oh, my ass.
[96:48.65]I can't fucking... I'm so glad that this is a, like, waist-up scenario here.
[96:56.83]Where at levels where, like, I could get in trouble if this was, like, a waist-down camp?
[97:06.33]It's like so sweaty and awful.
[97:13.27]No, not that.
[97:14.84]Not that way.
[97:16.02]Alright.
[97:21.06]This should be a little more movable.
[97:24.38]Alright.
[97:24.60]That's good.
[97:25.38]Make sure I can move it out.
[97:26.98]I can.
[97:27.44]Alright.
[97:27.67]Let's get back in.
[97:28.21]I'm ready to do.
[97:28.79]I've got the bow and arrow.
[97:29.81]I'm going to have some interesting fun.
[97:39.27]Oh, the levels are good.
[97:40.29]I'm good.
[97:40.82]Let's go.
[97:42.36]Spin this back around.
[97:43.44]Make sure I'm facing the right way.
[97:45.56]Oh.
[97:48.87]Hold on.
[97:49.29]There's so much water in here.
[98:07.48]I need to get something to help clean this shit up.
[98:12.74]Alright.
[98:13.50]Is this taking screenshots?
[98:15.98]Why does it keep doing that?
[98:24.68]Alright.
[98:25.87]Let's go.
[98:49.56]Audio.
[98:52.72]Audio.
[98:53.46]Right here.
[98:55.20]I don't know which one is which.
[98:56.68]Which is the right and which is the left.
[98:57.76]Alright.
[99:10.27]Let's go.
[99:12.01]I got the where's my bow and arrow?
[99:16.75]Where's my bow?
[99:23.56]Wasn't there like a market?
[99:27.05]What?
[99:28.35]Is it a quiver?
[99:35.51]Give me those arrows.
[99:57.59]Okay.
[99:58.97]What happened to my bow?
[100:01.15]I have a sword back here now.
[100:03.71]Am I missing something here?
[100:06.95]Where'd my cool bow go?
[100:15.58]I haven't even done any environmental stuff.
[100:18.32]Why is it all the way over here?
[100:32.84]Hello?
[100:35.59]Why is it in the ground?
[100:45.93]Whatever, it's not like a fucking stick in the ground.
[100:48.08]That's great.
[100:48.54]Here, you know what?
[100:49.60]Couldn't take these then.
[100:50.76]I'll just throw these at people.
[100:52.96]Fight in it, alright.
[100:55.00]Uh, I can scroll down.
[100:58.16]How do I do that again, right?
[101:01.00]Uh, that was a lot of money.
[101:05.00]Somebody just gave a lot of money.
[101:10.22]I don't even know who it was.
[101:13.48]It was Freudian Weapon.
[101:15.24]Don't mind me just derailing your stream.
[101:18.81]Ha ha ha.
[101:20.45]I saw it.
[101:20.83]Got it.
[101:21.09]Freudian Weapon, thank you so much for the $50.
[101:22.57]And the derail.
[101:25.45]Special.
[101:26.05]Endless.
[101:27.29]No, thank you so much.
[101:28.13]I don't know where you are, but I think you're...
[101:33.30]Uh, you should be, like, here.
[101:35.92]Thank you so much, Freudia Weapon.
[101:38.80]For the 50 fucking dollars.
[101:40.22]Alright, we got 1v1.
[101:41.48]Classic.
[101:43.98]There's a few more things to try here.
[101:47.38]Enemies.
[101:47.84]Let me just do... Group 1.
[101:51.16]What is this?
[101:52.28]Multiple enemies, but only one melee attack at a time.
[101:57.77]Cult versus bandits.
[101:59.05]Random cult enemies against bandits.
[102:07.84]Am I just like the priest that sits here and watches the melee?
[102:13.63]Why is that guy naked?
[102:14.41]They're supposed to be fighting each other.
[102:17.79]Why are you attacking the priest?
[103:00.87]Alright, that's how that works.
[103:02.57]My face is really itchy.
[103:03.97]This fucking coal is on my face.
[103:07.01]And it's itching my face.
[103:09.71]And I can't scratch it.
[103:11.91]Ah, I don't know what to do.
[103:12.65]Get off.
[103:15.07]Remember when I told... Hold on a second.
[103:16.29]Remember when I told you something was going in my eye?
[103:17.93]This is like freaking me out now.
[103:25.80]Remember?
[103:26.22]Like an hour ago?
[103:28.22]Ah, something's like in my eye.
[103:29.26]How?
[103:30.87]This shit is melting off into my fucking eyes.
[103:33.13]Alright, I got the edge scratched.
[103:41.77]Let me go out.
[103:42.79]Let me go back out to like the menu menu.
[103:47.13]This is slow-mo.
[103:50.16]Let me try slow-mo, like hitting somebody in the head.
[104:21.95]Get his weapon!
[104:34.76]I'll do it!
[104:35.54]I'll do it!
[104:36.32]I'll do it!
[104:40.65]I'm trying!
[104:52.14]That was three people.
[104:55.72]That guy's like, oh, whoa, that was weird.
[105:04.17]I'm trying to slit his throat.
[105:07.89]I gotta move on from this game, but there's more to do.
[105:10.21]I'm having so much fun, I can't.
[105:14.96]I gotta hit somebody with another brick.
[105:17.08]Let's get only bricks.
[105:23.12]I'm gonna have plenty of cement blocks.
[105:24.62]Oh god.
[105:28.44]Okay, get them all up there.
[105:42.67]So, spell-wise, right?
[105:45.61]Do I have to like go to town and like buy shit?
[105:49.27]I've really only been doing this like weird arena thing.
[105:52.27]I'm gonna look into that in a second.
[105:53.43]Alright, let's get this started.
[106:00.12]I'm gonna try to just hit people with fucking blocks.
[106:14.31]I'm gonna crush somebody's head in between two logs.
[106:17.95]Are you ready for this shit?
[106:49.01]This is so fun.
[106:50.43]It's too fun.
[106:52.43]They made a game that was too much fun to play.
[107:01.55]Who's on me?
[107:02.35]What the fuck is happening to me?
[107:26.26]Give it to me!
[107:28.32]Put it in my hand!
[107:28.92]This is not how you hold an axe!
[107:32.03]I'm holding this like a fucking soda!
[108:31.46]It's just acting up.
[109:03.90]Dammit, I hit myself in the back!
[109:25.93]How do you block that?
[109:26.83]That's not a blockable move!
[109:28.17]That's a non-blockable move!
[110:04.47]Just run by.
[110:05.03]Come on.
[110:06.34]I'm like I'm in a marathon.
[110:07.46]Give me the camera.
[110:42.92]Get over here.
[110:45.60]Get over here.
[110:46.64]Get over here.
[111:40.19]Give me something!
[111:41.25]Give me the dagger!
[111:54.56]What?! !
[112:25.01]Why did that just happen?
[112:55.15]Oh!
[112:55.57]What happened there, folks?
[113:05.64]Shit!
[113:13.76]Come on, don't have to fucking game fuck me like that.
[113:15.52]I was just sad on this.
[113:43.63]What was that?
[113:55.98]This is intense.
[113:59.48]That was what, medium level three?
[114:03.28]I wasn't really using the slow-mo that much.
[114:04.54]Alright, let me go back to the menu.
[114:10.81]How the hell can I do that?
[114:18.97]What do we got here?
[114:19.75]Notes.
[114:21.17]Controller input.
[114:23.51]All these tips.
[114:30.04]Go to character, go home.
[114:32.44]Let's go home.
[114:36.42]Cool!
[114:37.16]Alright.
[114:39.34]Ugh, my fucking back.
[114:43.34]Let's go... Well now I know I can do this.
[114:49.02]So fun.
[114:49.34]Alright, what do we got?
[114:51.68]There's more things here.
[114:53.78]The market.
[114:54.74]What's the market?
[114:58.18]Someone put a price on your head.
[114:59.62]Now you're ambushed in town with no way out and everyone wants the bounty.
[115:02.76]It's either you or them.
[115:06.70]Okay, what about this one?
[115:07.80]This is the arena and this is the ruins.
[115:09.58]So this is the arena.
[115:11.78]This one, these are locked.
[115:13.20]Oh, these are work in progress.
[115:16.02]Okay, let's go to the market.
[115:26.74]Well, this is cool looking.
[115:31.02]Okay.
[115:36.63]Interesting place.
[115:38.07]What's over here?
[115:38.59]There's like a little blacksmith table.
[115:43.01]At least these weapons... Look at this.
[115:44.07]Oh, that's a big sword.
[115:45.49]That's like a bastard sword, right?
[115:54.16]That's a fine blade.
[116:10.17]It's hard to kind of use it like this, though, because you've got to use both.
[116:19.74]I'll give it a try.
[116:20.28]Alright, what do we got here?
[116:27.68]Let's do Easy Wave 2.
[116:28.64]There's a well.
[116:39.76]You can probably throw people down the well, I would assume.
[116:42.26]Do you ask?
[116:56.47]Two-handed is hard because the controllers are so big!
[116:58.35]No.
[117:01.87]Yeah, two-handed ain't gonna work.
[117:04.73]The controllers are too large.
[117:05.92]They just smash into each other.
[117:19.68]I'm getting like, wrapped up again in this cord.
[117:21.51]I have to like, step over the cord!
[117:30.61]My god.
[117:31.11]I gotta like, how do you pause the game?
[117:34.71]I'm like, wrapped up again.
[117:40.67]Can't pause real life.
[117:43.15]Even if there is a cord in the back of your head that is wrapping around you like going out and having a dog,
[117:49.57]and having another dog meet you, because they're on the same sidewalk, and then you get wrapped up by the fucking other person's leash, and you do the thing where you walk around in circles, the dogs are wrapping you both up now, and you're talking about like the fucking weather, that's what's happening to my body right now.
[118:06.63]There's a dog down here running in circles around two people.
[118:09.31]Two dogs.
[118:24.59]Happened.
[118:24.87]Did the game just like, lag?
[118:56.46]Fucking God, dude.
[118:57.48]Like, really.
[118:58.90]Look at this shit.
[119:20.38]Getting a ceiling hook?
[119:26.92]Get like a ceiling tether.
[119:37.45]No, I gotta get the wireless thing.
[119:43.27]The headset has to come off.
[119:46.41]Because it's just been spun around too many times.
[119:55.96]This cord is like such a thick-ass cord, too.
[119:58.13]Hold on.
[120:04.41]I gotta get that ceiling tether.
[120:19.36]I feel like I'm doing a puzzle right now.
[120:32.19]Oh, I'm sorry.
[120:32.65]People are going to probably throw up from looking at this, aren't they?
[120:37.71]I'm sorry.
[120:38.07]It's almost done.
[120:45.39]Okay.
[120:46.65]Alright.
[120:46.95]Yeah, no.
[120:47.75]Have a nice day.
[120:48.39]No, you got a beautiful dog.
[120:49.55]Beautiful dog.
[120:50.11]Yeah.
[120:50.35]What's his name?
[120:51.57]Oh, Ruff Ruff.
[120:52.73]Cool.
[120:53.07]Yeah, mine's Otto.
[120:54.27]Have a nice day.
[120:55.87]Fucking hell.
[121:13.29]Alright, last one and then we're gonna go to Beat Saber.
[121:27.88]I'm gonna make this one count.
[121:29.98]This game is so much fucking fun though.
[121:37.48]Alright, let's move.
[121:38.50]I'm gonna grab one more weapon that I haven't used.
[121:41.12]No, I want the bow and arrow.
[121:41.70]The bow and arrow is so much fun.
[121:42.83]I have to use the bow and arrow.
[121:46.89]What are you talking about?
[121:47.83]I don't need more.
[121:48.41]Okay.
[122:07.93]Let's get some slow-motion headshots, and then I'm going to call it.
[122:10.19]We'll go to Beat Saber.
[122:12.40]Just do, like, wave three.
[122:13.70]Easy go.
[122:16.08]Let's get a slow-motion headshot.
[122:25.07]Oh!

[126:13.15]It was like mining fucking coal over here.
[126:15.75]That's what I'm doing.
[126:19.33]What's this one?
[126:31.92]Quit this really, quit this reality.
[126:34.80]There we go.

[127:01.16]Well, oh well.
[127:05.06]Let's open Beat Saber.
[127:10.20]Although somehow I can still hear the game.
[127:15.27]Why can I still hear?
[127:20.43]Why can I still hear that?
[127:21.75]You hear the birds?
[127:24.56]Why can I hear birds?
[127:33.86]What just happened?
[127:43.79]Oh, SteamVR had to, like, restart.
[127:45.15]Oh, okay, there we go.
[127:50.68]Wait, what?
[127:53.56]Oh, this is, like, the home thing.
[127:55.66]Okay, SteamVR Home has the birds.
[127:57.42]I thought it was the other game.
[127:59.64]Let's do Beat Saber.
[128:01.06]Here it comes.
[128:08.71]We got a health and safety warning.
[128:14.42]Alright, let's get back in.
[128:16.78]Playing Beat Saber is dangerous and you're going to get hurt.
[128:20.24]You're going to mine for coal on the pole.
[128:22.78]Hopefully I didn't fucking cause a problem on that.
[128:25.10]Those things are expensive.
[128:28.46]I think we're good though.
[128:31.53]Stay healthy?
[128:32.01]I'm good.
[128:33.01]I'm good.

[128:54.82]Oh, I gotta change the, is there a mod here that can change the game to Beat Saber?
[129:00.66]Because I can't fucking do it.

[129:16.20]Let's see here, guys.
[129:19.69]At least this one I don't have to move around.
[129:21.11]Alright, let's see.
[129:30.29]Oh, okay, hold on.
[129:34.70]We'll get it in a second.
[129:35.52]Oh fuck, I don't think I can get it.
[129:39.24]Alright, we'll change that.
[129:54.98]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[129:58.66]This is gonna make me puke if I do this like this.

[130:30.85]Alright, here we go.
[130:31.41]Virtual world.

[130:45.86]Let's do it.
[130:46.38]Get in the game.
[130:47.34]Let me show you some of my fucking skills.
[130:52.50]This time I'm not gonna ding over there.
[130:53.92]Alright, please read health and safety warnings in your VR headset instruction manual before playing Beat Saber because you may be encouraged to perform intense actions with your controllers.
[131:05.71]Make sure to review your surroundings and clear any obstacles in your play area.
[131:10.19]AKA you.
[131:14.11]High physical activities have all the same habits as doing a regular workout.
[131:17.43]Don't forget to stretch before playing and rest regularly.
[131:21.86]Don't worry, I'll be fine.
[131:22.64]Alright, we got free play, party, levels played.
[131:29.75]Welcome, thanks for purchasing our game.
[131:30.97]We're a small team working hard to bring you the best VR and rhythm experience possible.
[131:35.37]Cool, alright.
[131:37.55]Is that free?
[131:38.29]Let's just play for free.
[131:41.08]Let's do this tutorial.
[131:51.31]Holy shit, this is cool.
[131:54.27]Ah, something about pork.
[132:03.01]Cut.
[132:09.59]Match the color and the direction.
[132:21.07]This is just like Space Channel 5!
[132:32.47]Do not cut or touch with sabers.
[132:40.02]Just like Fruit Ninja.
[132:46.18]Whoa!
[132:48.66]Make sure I'm in the right spot.
[132:54.45]How's the audio?
[133:00.01]Loud enough?
[133:02.84]I can barely see.
[133:03.92]Do like a funny emote if the audio is loud enough.
[133:14.58]I'm not seeing any funny emotes.
[133:15.76]That must mean... Okay, hold on.
[133:22.76]There's no audio.
[133:23.86]What the fuck?
[133:36.81]What the fuck is that?
[133:38.81]Why did it do that?
[133:41.37]Alright, we should be good.
[133:43.76]Alright, I'm ready.
[133:45.34]Let's play Beat Saber.
[133:46.84]I'm going to stand right here.
[133:51.70]Free play.
[133:53.28]Uh, Pop Stars.
[133:54.16]This is from, uh, wait, this is the one from League of Legends.
[133:59.39]Let's play Pop Stars from League of Legends.
[134:02.09]What?
[134:02.35]Whoa, what?
[134:02.73]Hey, I don't want to join anybody's group.
[134:04.45]Why is this on?
[134:05.17]Why is this on here?
[134:47.23]I'm losing the audio in my ear.
[134:50.64]It's gonna fall out.
[134:51.92]No, no, no.
[135:31.24]I love this song!
[136:06.03]Ain't nobody bringing us down, down, down.
[136:35.69]times eight bonus.
[137:37.71]B for Boomer.
[137:41.07]Nice KD.
[137:45.93]It's a little loud.
[137:46.77]Alright, yeah.
[137:47.55]It does look a little loud, doesn't it?
[137:50.49]That's better.
[137:53.49]It was way too loud.
[137:55.16]It's alright.
[137:55.56]B for Boomer.
[137:56.14]I'm going back in.
[138:00.50]This is really, really cool.
[138:02.78]I mean, I kind of have to, like, close my mouth and just play it, but this is fucking fun.
[138:07.48]You just, like, kind of zone in.
[138:18.12]How am I doing?
[138:20.64]How's the hair look?
[138:22.56]Let's do it again.
[138:23.06]Another one.
[138:23.76]What's, like, a good song?
[138:24.62]What would you guys say is the best Beat Saber song?
[138:29.00]Let's take a look.
[138:29.90]Let's do... Let's cut it on hard.
[138:31.98]And I gotta get ready.
[138:32.72]Okay, this is... Let... No.
[138:34.05]Get...
[138:35.75]Valve, who made that?
[138:37.76]Okay, what does this mean?
[138:40.18]Just single, solo?
[138:42.92]Standard, one saver.
[138:44.36]Okay, no arrows.
[138:45.82]Oh, I don't know about that one.
[138:48.48]Let's hear it.
[138:49.76]Is this one artist?
[139:04.17]Do I... How do I play like other ones?
[139:11.34]Is this all songs I have?
[139:22.56]Let's try it.
[140:18.94]Ah!
[140:19.12]God damn it!
[140:20.73]I don't... Get out of my head!
[140:51.05]Fucking Steam notifications.
[140:52.39]I don't know how many times you have to turn off Steam notifications and like delete it from your goddamn inventory, but it never stops.
[141:02.26]This one's better.
[141:10.83]I like this one.

[149:46.92]Where's the custom shit?
[149:48.32]How do I do the custom stuff?
[149:54.00]What's happening here?

[150:54.17]Oh, alright.
[150:57.17]Well, let me just get this installed then.
[151:00.87]And then where do you get the songs?
[151:02.59]From BeatSaver.com?
[151:04.63]No, that's not real.
[151:05.51]That's a fake website.
[151:16.62]Is it really?
[151:17.28]BeatSaver.
[151:22.70]So install them from in the game.
[151:24.18]Okay.
[151:26.62]So let me just get this then.
[151:33.72]Alright.
[151:34.56]How do I do this?
[151:34.94]Probably install custom mods.
[151:37.03]This uses Mod Saber to get the latest approved and manually verified mods, the latest version automatically.
[151:41.35]Okay, so Mod Saber.
[151:44.07]This program currently supports every approved mod on modsaber.org.

[152:28.87]I'll get a bunch of good songs.
[152:34.22]We can play Country Road.
[152:39.18]And I also need to get the mod that lets me look at my hand and a Discord channel to suggest songs.
[152:45.66]Yeah, I have the program.
[152:49.37]I have that VR Drop program.
[152:52.51]But I couldn't get it to work.
[152:54.51]I could get it to open up chat, but I was trying to get it to stay on my hand.
[152:57.31]And how do I...
[152:58.70]You know, there's a lot I need to kind of do before that.
[153:01.22]I look haggard.
[153:02.06]I mean, it's because I have this shit on my face.
[153:04.52]Alright, let's do it.
[153:06.35]I'm going to do like a couple more, just the default ones, and then we'll move on to... What's the other game that I got here?
[153:13.75]I got... I have budget cuts.
[153:22.51]Let me do a few more.
[153:27.59]Yeah, this super hot VR.
[153:28.71]I've got so much to play.
[153:31.47]I'm going to try to do like three games.
[153:34.24]Three to four games a night.
[153:36.36]Each game for about an hour.
[153:38.56]And then we're going to... I'm going like two or three days straight here, guys.
[153:43.62]Let me do one more of these fun ones.
[153:47.37]And we'll go to budget cuts.
[153:50.25]For like an hour or two.
[153:54.05]I just didn't know that you had to...
[154:16.19]I'm a living legend.
[154:17.79]You ain't heard yet, you not get the message.
[154:20.47]From the moment that I step in and I get a couple weapons, yeah, I turn to a beast when I'm reppin'.
[154:26.84]I'm a living legend.
[154:28.48]You ain't heard yet, you not get the message.
[154:31.17]From the moment that I step in and I get a couple weapons, yeah, I turn to a beast when I'm reppin'.
[156:09.86]I did expert first try on that, that's a C, but it's the first time I've ever heard that song.
[156:15.17]I've never even heard that song before.
[156:16.55]Let's go, come on.
[157:09.27]I started to get it.
[157:10.03]I started to figure it out.
[157:10.75]Let's do that one on hard.
[158:00.18]that.
[158:30.34]I think I've got to the place of no return here.
[158:31.86]And I'll tell you what I mean by that in a minute.
[159:25.44]So here's what I mean by that.
[159:27.02]Once you do hard in Expert, and especially Expert, certain sections... Certain sections of every one of these levels now, not on Expert, feels too easy, and certain sections are way too hard.
[159:40.87]You know what I mean?
[159:41.81]Like, I should have just done... But normal is... Easy is too easy.
[159:45.51]I went... I did... I got... I went point and overturn.
[159:49.91]Last one.
[159:51.43]Here we go.
[159:53.39]Country Road.
[159:56.73]Did I already do this one?
[159:59.46]No, I didn't do this one, did I?
[160:38.27]See, like this is too easy.
[160:39.33]You know what I mean?
[160:41.21]I've ruined it.
[160:42.25]Now I have to play this on expert.
[161:47.53]I got cocky.
[161:48.62]Don't get cocky.
[162:46.79]BA!
[162:48.59]A B!
[162:49.07]How do you get a B with 293 out of 295?
[162:52.21]That's an A. That's an A+.
[162:53.09]Alright, now let me, like, eat my words.
[162:57.08]Let's do Expert+.
[163:35.80]That's fucking hard.
[163:40.42]Do it again?
[163:41.46]Again?
[163:41.72]No, we'll do this tomorrow.
[163:43.70]Holy fuck.

[185:14.12]Beware.
[185:14.76]Do not do anything weird.
[185:16.20]Top secret.
[185:21.76]Move your controller to equip the translocator.
[185:28.91]Okay.
[185:33.09]Now it's time to go.
[185:33.73]I got to get to the... Let me take these because I'm scared I'm going to need them.
[185:37.18]I'm going to forget how to do everything.
[185:39.78]Reading emails.
[185:40.82]Filing files.
[185:41.78]So your desk, go out, find the elevator, go to the third floor, and find me.

[185:48.03]Third floor, elevator.
[185:58.57]How about...
[186:11.82]I can only show you the door.
[186:13.60]You are the one that must walk through.
[186:16.78]There's an open window.
[186:25.73]Fruit travels through the air similar to a banana.
[186:28.15]Okay, so everything travels through the air similar to a banana.
[186:45.83]What is considered great at one point in time may not have connection to something previously considered small.
[186:55.60]I made it.
[186:57.94]Every day is taco day.
[186:59.60]Yeah, sure.
[187:00.86]Alright, we're in.
[187:12.45]Find the elevator, go to the third floor.
[187:14.78]Itchy nose, hold on.
[187:16.30]Every day is taco day.
[187:20.00]What do we got?
[187:25.13]Soda?
[187:27.01]I didn't know you could do that.
[188:13.17]Whoa there.
[188:17.31]No, no, no, no, no.
[188:18.79]Go back out.
[188:27.16]Oh, whoopsie.
[188:43.57]Fuck off.

[189:25.07]I can't kill him.
[189:37.76]I'm trying.
[189:38.08]I'm trying to kill him.
[190:00.49]Give me the fucking ashtray.
[190:09.62]Hey, look over here.
[190:14.00]Your point.
[190:17.10]This is a fucking ashtray, dude.
[190:18.54]How many?
[190:22.27]Oh, fuck, what'd I hit?
[190:23.09]I don't know.
[190:35.29]Running out of time.
[190:35.84]Let's go.
[191:05.12]Get out there.
[191:08.27]Where is she?
[191:15.33]Tell me where she is.
[191:17.57]This is like... Alright, what do I do?
[191:28.58]I'm gonna go to the elevator, right?
[191:40.02]I'm fighting back.
[191:41.16]I don't know where I am in my room.
[191:47.19]No, it's okay.
[191:47.67]Another person is throwing a window.
[191:52.71]Cookie?
[191:55.39]Alright, I need the elevator.
[192:06.36]Can I get a water?
[192:19.60]Was that?
[192:20.18]Oh, there's coffee right there.
[192:21.46]Give me that.
[192:22.90]Give me coffee.
[192:33.05]I want the coffee.
[192:36.48]How do I get fucking coffee out of this thing?
[192:54.24]Alright, let's go.
[192:56.57]Uh, what can you do for me?
[192:59.85]Anything?
[193:00.57]Rex.
[193:01.97]Gold cup.
[193:02.25]What did I say?
[193:03.63]I don't know.
[193:22.73]Now serving 75, lost and found.
[193:28.07]Do I need to get something from you?
[193:36.28]Another day, another dollar.
[193:40.78]No.
[193:43.01]Hello, human.
[193:43.99]I am very busy with my tasks.
[193:46.09]Can we be friends?
[193:48.87]I don't know.
[193:49.75]You got anything under there for Elbertson?
[193:55.21]Fuck you.
[193:56.13]Here's the elevator.
[193:56.67]I found it.
[193:57.21]Level 3.
[193:57.43]Do I need money?
[194:08.10]That's a wall.
[194:08.72]Alright, do I have a soda?
[194:13.00]Alright, hold on.
[194:14.74]Wait, wait, wait.
[194:15.30]Get rid of this.
[194:15.74]I don't need that anymore.
[194:16.61]I don't need this anymore.
[194:18.31]I need to know what you look like, though.
[194:19.57]Let's get a couple sodas.
[194:20.49]Let's get some sodas.
[194:22.65]At least one or two.
[194:23.29]I need to have a whole lunch.
[194:27.65]I got a whole lunch now.
[194:28.51]We got apple, cookie, two sodas.
[194:31.85]Perfect American lunch.
[194:33.26]There's a wall.
[194:37.90]What am I going to touch?
[194:42.26]I don't know, but I'm going to be very slow.
[194:43.76]Floor three, right?
[194:54.59]Bingo.
[194:55.05]Let's go.
[194:59.03]360 degrees of fun.
[195:06.68]Supervision Acquisitions HR comm team.
[195:10.72]And that guy.
[195:12.39]That guy over there.
[195:15.53]We got a new, wait, mission objective updated.
[195:17.55]2041, okay.
[195:28.63]2048.
[195:29.27]Isn't that like an iPhone game?
[195:33.00]No.
[195:35.94]No!
[195:39.80]Right, you made it.
[195:41.34]The quickest way to the exit is via the acquisitions department, but there are robots of the unfriendly kind ahead.
[195:47.44]Transcorp insists on using military-grade assault robots for supervisor duties.
[195:52.11]So efficient.
[195:53.85]Not.
[195:55.02]Use the stealth feature on the translocator to avoid alerting them.
[195:57.90]Stealth feature?
[195:58.58]Oh, you'll need an access card.
[196:00.28]I think the manager on this floor might have one.
[196:02.24]Grab it and head to acquisitions.
[196:04.32]Good luck.
[196:05.34]Okay.
[196:08.02]So I have a... Is this stealth?
[196:12.71]Is this my stealth right now?
[196:16.79]This is like a bug net.
[196:17.99]I don't know what to do.
[196:20.49]The stealth feature.
[196:30.22]Oh.
[196:32.46]I was going to call you back.
[196:34.10]Get to acquisitions.
[196:34.96]Might need a keycard.
[196:35.76]I have a keycard, didn't I?
[196:36.76]I have a keycard.
[196:39.02]What happened to one?
[196:39.58]Did I throw the keycard down?
[196:44.17]Okay, watch out.
[196:45.15]That guy's going to shoot at me.
[196:47.91]And there's a stealth.
[196:48.97]I don't even know what this does.
[196:54.29]Use the stealth feature.
[197:11.79]You know... I'm just gonna fucking go over there.
[197:16.89]I'll get a tutorial right now, won't I?
[197:18.47]Alright, where's my tutorial?
[197:21.78]Friends, I'm sure you have noticed your brand new supervisor colleagues at late.
[197:27.54]They have a difficult enough job keeping everyone focused on the task at hand.
[197:32.58]So don't let their methods concern you.
[197:35.54]No, really.
[197:36.70]Don't.
[197:44.23]I don't know.
[197:45.93]I thought it was like a fucking scrambler.
[197:49.15]Hold both pads to reapply.
[198:05.18]Alright Mission objective updated.
[198:09.85]Yeah, but how do I do the thing?
[198:20.30]Hello, listen again Alright, you made it
[198:25.63]The quickest way to the exit is via the acquisitions department.
[198:28.23]Right.
[198:28.61]But there are robots of the unfriendly kind ahead.
[198:31.73]TransCorp insists on using military grade assault robots for supervisor duties.
[198:35.72]They use a handout.
[198:36.42]So efficient.
[198:38.14]Not.
[198:39.30]Use the stealth feature on the translocator to avoid alerting them.
[198:42.36]Stealth feature?
[198:42.86]Oh, you'll need an access card.
[198:45.17]The stealth feature.
[198:47.55]They didn't tell me this last time.
[198:55.09]When portal is open, press and hold to translocate silently.
[198:57.82]It didn't tell me that before.
[199:04.78]Friends, I'm sure you've all noticed your brand new supervisor colleagues have late.
[199:10.55]They have a difficult enough job keeping everyone focused on the task at hand.
[199:16.15]So don't let their methods concern you.
[199:18.56]No, really.
[199:19.72]Don't let their methods concern you.
[199:24.12]Don't look, don't look, don't look.
[199:25.10]I don't know what that is, but I'm gonna take it.
[199:28.24]Achievement unlocked.
[199:29.00]I got a crab.
[199:32.24]Everything seems quiet.
[199:34.74]Maybe too quiet.
[199:39.04]Is that a window?
[199:39.62]Fucking god, I thought it was an open window!
[199:45.52]I thought it was an open- I thought it was- ha ha!
[199:51.76]And why would that have helped anyways?
[199:53.46]How would he have even done anything about that?
[199:55.66]He would have, I thought he was gonna look down like Metal Gear Solid or something.
[199:58.14]Alright, I got it, I got it, I gotta turn it on.
[200:07.34]I know, I know, just look, I'm gonna dial the number.
[200:26.25]Okay, here we go.
[200:27.81]What's in there?
[200:28.95]Manager.

[201:13.27]Okay, I'm at the manager's desk.
[201:17.67]Don't have the urge to throw a fucking rock over there.
[201:19.59]I know you want to.
[201:23.15]Anything in the filing cabinets?
[201:24.13]No.
[201:27.71]Alright, manager's desk.

[204:40.59]Alright, I'm looking for the key card.
[204:48.31]Colleagues, I've received a few notes about your supervisor's complaint.

[207:19.92]Hi!
[207:42.03]What does this say?
[207:44.01]Placeholder text for a lazy dev who forgot to replace the proper text string thing.
[207:50.97]So you suck, whiz dev.
[207:54.47]Wow, it takes effort to write more than a couple words for some reason.
[207:57.11]I just wanted to fill an A4 with things.

[211:31.59]Two.
[211:34.15]Three.
[211:35.29]That didn't do anything.
[211:36.01]Okay.
[211:50.85]What else we got?
[211:54.15]Got to go across there.

[212:31.24]Interesting, we're gonna go that way.
[212:32.52]It's not in, yes it is.
[212:43.93]Ah, well this seems to be a dead end.
[212:46.29]No it's not.
[212:56.16]There's no animals in here.
[213:00.66]The brush is mightier than the sword.
[213:04.38]That's what they're describing, okay.
[213:20.35]That exploded.
[213:22.77]That thing was already ready to blow.
[213:39.08]Can you guys even fucking see me right now?
[213:46.80]Am I feeling on camera?
[213:51.35]Buttons, what do these do?
[213:52.07]I don't think they do anything.
[214:02.04]No, I have to do something with this.
[214:10.62]How do I?
[214:15.42]Oh, hello.
[214:19.83]Bathroom, we made it.
[214:22.01]Wow, you have an appearance.
[214:36.13]Whoa!
[214:36.67]Twitter.
[214:40.71]Ah, soap.
[214:41.19]I gotta play with the soap dispenser.
[214:42.34]I mean, it's a VR game.
[214:43.40]You gotta click on everything, right?
[214:44.44]They didn't even program soap to come out of the soap dispenser?
[214:47.88]What, are you fucking kidding me?
[214:50.66]Let's go in the trash.
[215:01.23]Anybody in here?
[215:09.94]Alright, well, let's get in.
[215:24.14]Oh, don't mind me.

[215:35.15]Ready?
[215:35.31]Go!
[215:55.85]Alright, let me get out of the bathroom.
[216:02.13]It's just like the other one.
[216:03.73]Need some TP?
[216:05.33]Sure, I'll get it for you.
[216:12.96]How do I get out of this?
[216:14.06]I gotta... Alright, no fucking way.
[216:23.62]Is there a wall?
[216:25.69]There's a wall coming up.
[216:28.91]I don't know where I am in the room.
[216:47.30]I was slamming that on my knee.
[216:48.80]It was like right on my knee.
[216:50.06]My knee was right there.
[216:51.26]It hurt.
[216:57.81]The stalls open out this way.
[216:59.93]There's going to be a guy in here, right?
[217:15.33]He's going to be like, oh, excuse me, right?
[217:21.78]No, nobody in here.
[217:25.02]Nobody even in the bathroom.
[217:28.33]What am I ever going to do about all my fucking moments?
[217:41.47]Alright.
[217:46.60]Alright.
[217:49.98]I gotta get out of the bathroom before I do something that I'm going to get in trouble for.
[217:53.06]Get me out of the bathroom now.
[217:55.02]I don't care about an item.
[217:55.96]Get me out.
[217:56.60]Leave.
[217:56.86]Bathroom now.
[217:58.38]Bathroom out.
[218:03.54]Today's work is to live by?
[218:05.24]Defy expectations.
[218:07.90]You know, they used to hear me talk and think I was as dumb as my hair.
[218:11.00]Lost and found again.
[218:12.64]But look at me now.
[218:14.22]In my own tech empire, we knew this motivational note in my favorite hat.
[218:19.05]So remember, we're all in the same boat.
[218:21.81]Except mine is probably bigger and more expensive.
[218:26.95]So what is our objective right now?
[218:30.45]Something, right?
[218:31.51]Home sweet office.
[218:37.51]Hey!
[218:38.39]The microphone doesn't work.
[218:40.19]Can I be back?
[218:40.63]Can I get back here?
[218:42.43]I guess I can get back here.
[218:43.55]It's a fucking secret.
[218:45.65]You guys didn't think I was going to get the fuck secret.
[218:48.13]The early bird.
[218:50.11]Look at this shit.
[218:50.76]Why, hello, human co-worker.
[218:54.30]What's going on on my shelf?
[219:04.47]No, I need something heavier.
[219:06.03]Excuse you.
[219:09.73]Oh, whoopsie.
[219:12.31]Okay, bye.
[219:15.70]This one needs a level one security code.
[219:17.72]I have that.
[219:18.24]Give it a swipe.
[219:30.08]What happened?
[219:31.46]Oh, five, seven, 11.
[219:37.06]Five, seven, one, one.
[219:39.92]Yeah?
[219:40.88]I'm not sure if this line is tapped, so there's a package of letter openers waiting for you in the distributions department.
[219:49.15]Distributions?
[219:49.59]They're shiny, sharp, and stabby letter openers that will definitely help you to escape.
[219:55.27]Distributions?
[219:55.89]I'll just say that a manifest that said, safe, totally harmless letter openers, and another manifest that said, sharp, pointy knives, magically got switched around.
[220:07.56]hilarious alright I mailed you a box in the distribution center which is over here here we go should I like do more like VR should I get like really into it and like have you guys see like for instance like that's pretty cool right like it's actually got weight to it would morpheus be here
[220:36.43]Alright, distribution center.
[220:38.93]The brush is muddier than the sword.
[220:40.21]You've seen this already.
[220:47.18]Can't do anything with this.
[220:48.84]Can't do anything with this.
[220:51.92]This is fucking Daffy Ducks, like three nephews, whatever they are.
[220:56.46]Tweedlee, Tweedledum, and Tweedledoo.
[220:59.77]Fuck them.
[221:01.25]Alright.
[221:05.56]I don't think there's anything in here.
[221:06.50]Wait, there might be an Easter egg right here.
[221:11.56]No.
[221:24.22]No, nothing in here.
[221:25.14]Wait, wait, wait, what's that?
[221:35.06]Alright, distribution center is over here.
[221:37.04]That's Joan Tacey's office.
[221:42.63]There's Nikki Hortense.
[221:46.25]That's not, I don't think it's going, do I have to go in everybody's office and see what they have on the desk?
[221:55.81]Wait, there's a note here.
[222:01.74]Oh my goodness.
[222:03.98]My dear Nikki, I hope that your travels have brought you new perspective as to... This is too... I can't read it.
[222:10.68]Look, here, just take a screenshot.
[222:11.76]Ready?
[222:13.92]Take a screencap, and then you can read it later.
[222:15.55]Alright, let's go.
[222:33.74]Distributions continue.
[222:35.64]Hello!
[222:37.86]I'm just a bully.
[222:39.50]Alright, you need that notebook?
[222:46.95]I just did the magic trick.
[223:06.71]Oh, no, it's not coming in here.
[223:07.63]No, no, we're good, we're good.
[223:11.93]Two big cans of soda you got here.
[223:16.61]The Transforms.
[223:17.91]Who is Dr. Gimble Locke?
[223:24.08]Howdy.
[223:24.82]Cool.
[223:25.04]Can I help you?
[223:25.44]Alright, this is a secure area.
[223:32.38]Level one key, I got that shit right here.
[223:35.04]Distributions is this way.
[223:44.90]Oh, he opens the door!
[223:52.47]Holy fuck, man!
[223:54.79]Oh my god, he's gonna shoot me with a gun!
[224:01.32]I thought... I didn't know he opened the doors.
[224:07.70]So you guys are that way, right?
[224:10.52]We're not.
[224:11.82]You guys are over here?
[224:14.76]No, you guys are this way.
[224:18.36]Hey, guys.
[224:19.53]How are you?
[224:25.93]Okay.
[224:26.11]I don't understand what that other thing is for.
[224:27.49]It's a door.
[224:45.05]Oh, wow, that doesn't look right.
[224:48.91]That doesn't look right at all.
[224:50.61]Where am I?
[224:54.13]What year is it right now?
[224:55.15]Five, seven, do I have to call the number again?
[224:57.47]I have to call the number again.
[225:08.14]Oh boy, we're getting some problems here.
[225:15.71]Okay, I'm gonna open these all.
[225:16.73]These are all open, right?
[225:17.57]Get them all open.
[225:18.88]Keep them open.
[225:20.12]Because they're escape pods.
[225:22.16]They're wasting me to get the hell out of here.
[225:27.98]Alright.
[225:30.26]Uh, hello.
[225:30.86]When you feel down, look up!
[225:31.88]Can I not do anything about that?
[225:49.14]Alright, let's just get back out here at Distribution Center.
[225:51.16]Give me that key.
[226:27.28]What is this?
[226:27.64]Did I save this?
[226:30.08]The office?
[226:31.10]Dear friend at the office, I'm very happy to be live here on my vacation.
[226:34.36]Please don't look for me.
[226:38.42]Desk 132B.
[227:33.08]He doesn't come down here, does he?
[227:38.37]Does he come in here?
[228:12.73]Distribution.
[228:13.33]Alright, I made it.
[228:14.37]Look at the knives.
[228:15.97]Letter openers.
[228:16.61]Hey, excuse me.
[228:17.49]Okay, unbox pens, call mom, smile.
[228:19.75]Alright, what is it?
[228:20.83]A bear?
[228:42.23]One, five, nine, eight.
[228:48.31]So there's only two?
[228:49.39]Another day, another dollar.
[228:50.91]How do they work?
[228:57.12]I'm not even holding it right.
[229:01.10]Okay, why do you have like three microwaves up here?
[229:04.34]What is it?
[229:05.02]Uh, one, five, nine, eight.
[229:07.72]They have better people skills than how they worked with actual people.
[229:13.32]Hi, so the good folk of distributions have already distributed the knives.
[229:19.03]I mean, the letter openers to all the office supply rooms.
[229:22.77]Grab some on your way through to the cybernetics department.
[229:25.51]I know it seems a bit ominous, but it's the quickest path to the exit.
[229:29.45]Good luck.
[229:31.41]You and then I have to go to cybernetics.
[229:33.79]Oh, God damn it.
[229:34.93]What did I hit?
[229:35.69]The fucking wall.
[229:37.51]Okay.
[229:42.01]Cybernetics.
[229:45.90]Watch out, okay?
[229:46.50]I'm taking a break.
[229:55.42]I need to locate a caffeinated beverage.
[230:00.64]Hello?
[230:01.40]Did you eat something?
[230:02.16]I'm trying to put the head on you like in Skyrim and then steal from you, right?
[230:04.94]That scared me.
[230:06.18]Sorry.
[230:07.99]Alright, cybernetics.
[230:08.95]Let's go.
[230:11.21]Well, actually, what's in here?
[230:16.24]Any more letter openers in here that I need to be made aware of?
[230:26.75]What key is that?
[230:28.33]Just locked.
[230:32.29]No phone in here, though.
[230:34.95]No, same, 1598.
[230:35.63]Come on, I need some more, any more letters?
[230:44.91]Not that I can see.
[230:45.85]Let's just go to cybernetics.
[230:47.13]Alright.
[230:52.19]Here we go.
[231:01.97]What?
[231:05.14]Can I not open this door?
[231:10.80]Oh.
[231:16.05]I guess we're going over here.
[231:20.10]Well, found them.
[231:26.42]How many knives am I gonna need?
[231:33.86]Nice, okay, well, I kinda need all these.
[231:57.74]Shut up.
[231:58.62]Alright, so yeah, you can throw the knives.
[232:04.91]The knives actually have weight to them and they move, cool.
[232:24.57]Cybernetics, let's make our way over there.
[232:26.41]What do you say?
[232:31.46]Watch out.
[232:31.84]This is one, right?
[232:32.62]Give me that key card.
[232:39.42]You got scissors.
[232:40.21]Can I throw the scissors at somebody?
[232:41.33]I have to be able to, right?
[232:43.31]Like, fucking gouge somebody's eyes out?
[232:44.89]I thought that was the actual wall and it scared the fuck out of me.
[232:49.95]I can't take these.
[232:50.57]I'm just gonna walk around them.
[233:01.34]Anything outside?
[233:03.94]No, just keep going.
[233:09.35]I hear somebody moving around.
[233:10.33]There we go, okay.
[233:29.58]There is somebody in here.
[233:31.85]One of those bad guys.
[233:32.97]Uh... Can I throw this at him and hit him in the face and knock him out?
[233:43.28]I'm going back to the first area.
[233:47.24]I'm so confused right now.
[233:48.10]Hold on.
[233:49.20]This is the first area, isn't it?
[233:52.82]I made it back to the first place.
[233:55.52]Good news, employees!
[233:57.12]Your HR catch-ups with Adam are just around the corner.
[234:01.28]What the hell happened?
[234:02.34]Did I?
[234:02.78]Floor six?
[234:03.12]Did I do it?
[234:03.56]Where am I going?
[234:37.49]Okay, I'm still going.
[234:39.43]Okay.
[234:40.53]There are more knives here.
[234:44.55]I gotta try to throw a knife at somebody, right?
[235:00.08]I gotta hit this guy with a knife.
[235:05.06]What's that?
[235:05.38]There's a wall here.
[235:07.18]Back it up.
[235:07.62]Back it up.
[235:07.96]Back it up.
[235:08.32]Back it up.
[235:08.62]There's a wall right there.
[235:11.88]What the fuck is going on down there?
[235:20.35]Wait for him.
[235:22.15]Wait for him.
[235:38.20]Wait for them.
[236:07.13]Hey, thanks, buddy.
[236:09.50]I owe you one.
[236:41.33]No, turn the lights off!
[236:45.25]Oh, you hit me right in the face!
[237:13.70]That was a chimpanzee.
[237:16.22]Should've used knives more often.
[237:18.56]Yeah, I... How's the coal?
[237:32.23]Splinter Cell.
[237:35.27]How was your latest session?
[237:38.64]That was pretty sick.
[237:45.89]Not as bad?
[237:47.04]Nah.
[237:47.52]I must have acid-sweated through the whole thing.
[237:53.96]Angle the camera down?
[237:55.20]What, so when I go like this?
[237:57.34]And I'm, like, sneaking down?
[237:59.34]If I angle the camera down, then you won't be able to see me when I'm, like, back here, or, like, over here, or moving around here.
[238:03.58]Uh... Alright, I'm gonna give it another attempt.
[238:07.80]I'm gonna go one more time.
[238:08.94]And then I gotta take a break.
[238:11.61]This is fucking fun, though.
[238:13.83]What a blast.
[238:15.15]Virtual reality.
[238:18.60]Turn the webcam sideways.
[238:20.40]I can't, like, mount it.
[238:22.94]Ugh.
[238:27.48]Alright, let's do it again.
[238:28.32]One more time.
[238:28.72]Let's see if I can get to at least the end of this little section here.
[238:30.96]There's so much hair is bunching up and it's being ripped out.
[238:34.51]Look at this.
[238:36.13]Okay, so remember those infomercials where it was the vacuum that cut your hair?
[238:41.21]If I pull this up, it's all coming out.
[238:58.97]Hey, how's everybody doing?
[239:00.29]How are you?
[239:01.27]Yeah, it's been rough, but it's alright.
[239:02.89]I'm doing alright.
[239:03.52]I'm doing good.
[239:04.94]How are you doing?
[239:05.56]How's everything going?
[239:06.24]How are the kids?
[239:08.94]Yeah, you know, I'm like the guy that screams at people under the bridge now.
[239:11.68]You know, that's what I do.
[239:13.26]It's been really, you know, it gets the job done.
[239:16.79]Ow.
[239:35.60]I'm gonna have to take a hose to this.
[239:45.45]My poor hair.
[239:46.21]It was already struggling.
[239:48.49]It's just gonna come out.
[239:50.32]Let me get another sip of this drink, and we'll try it one more time.
[239:57.32]He thinks he's streaming.
[240:07.57]So I see that there's been barely any dropped frames in about four hours, so that's a good sign.
[240:18.42]This patient thinks he's in a stream in VR.
[240:22.30]I need to get like a beanie or a goddamn haircut would do too.
[240:35.27]Alright, let's get back in.
[240:40.28]I'll do one more death.
[240:43.02]Or one more attempt.
[240:43.96]Get this back behind me.
[240:54.09]So, tomorrow... is more.
[241:00.65]I gotta think about a situation to untangle this fucking cord.
[241:08.52]I'm going to have to figure out a solution.
[241:10.97]Is this left or right?
[241:11.85]I don't know.
[241:12.63]I don't know if this is left or right.
[241:17.71]Okay.
[241:18.63]This one is left.
[241:23.27]I expect you to die.
[241:25.07]I expect you to die.
[241:29.95]It's not.
[241:32.56]It's the wrong game.
[241:38.62]What's happening here?
[241:41.76]Oh, right.
[241:46.44]One.
[241:47.59]Two.
[241:48.23]Don't touch that one.
[241:56.31]So the object... Am I going to be all the way back?
[241:58.33]No, I have to be at a checkpoint or something, right?
[242:02.52]No, this is perfect.
[242:03.24]Alright, I'm in a good spot.
[242:05.62]I have... Let's knife this motherfucker.
[242:10.65]I'm not even going to be scared about this.
[242:12.69]Do you think I'm scared?
[242:14.81]What are you going to do about that one?
[242:20.08]He's just like pissing over here.
[242:22.58]No, that doesn't count.
[242:23.76]That didn't count.
[242:25.08]That didn't count.
[242:43.48]He was just letting it ride over here.
[242:54.92]Get me back in.
[242:57.02]Do it again.
[242:57.48]I gotta hit him right in the face.
[243:07.29]Right in the face.
[243:22.57]Do it again.
[243:26.61]I'll do another one.
[243:27.17]I'll throw a second one.
[243:38.60]Please wait.
[243:40.30]Please wait.
[243:57.45]Dead.
[243:57.73]Give me that knife back.
[243:58.63]What?
[243:58.91]Oh.
[243:59.15]Okay.
[243:59.51]I'm making it through.
[244:00.15]Welcome to the 7X Division of Transcar.
[244:02.41]I almost had a dream about robots.
[244:05.45]About making robots.
[244:06.54]It was beautiful.
[244:27.35]I ain't getting fucking caught here.
[244:33.80]Where's that wall?
[244:36.30]Make sure I don't touch that fucking wall.
[244:41.78]Why did I just kill that?
[244:42.79]Why did I do that to that guy?
[245:12.68]Fuck.
[245:13.92]This one's gotta count!
[245:17.86]I'm freezing!
[245:45.25]He could have talked, okay, he could have talked.
[245:47.23]One, five, nine, eight, no, not yet.
[246:19.07]That's two.
[246:19.71]I need two level two.
[246:23.20]Work hard, get one access.
[246:25.94]Anybody have like a key card over here?
[246:27.32]Can I get in that?
[246:34.30]No, I can't get in the production thing.
[246:35.61]Stop that.
[246:45.85]Maybe go back up?
[246:46.93]Let me just check some desks.
[246:50.29]No.
[246:51.25]If you go in here.
[246:54.59]Eh.
[247:22.63]I guess I'm gonna go back up.
[247:33.91]Was I back here yet?
[247:34.67]I don't think I was back here yet.
[247:40.21]Somebody's desk?
[247:40.97]Anybody got level two in here?
[247:44.21]Oh, that's where you find the money!
[247:53.54]Beautiful.
[247:54.67]Level two.
[247:55.03]I gotta go for, like, a bouncing shot here.
[248:04.47]Just like that.
[248:05.23]Alright, back down.
[248:06.27]Where is it?
[248:06.65]Over here, right?
[248:12.10]I'll get that later.
[248:14.40]Level two.
[248:18.72]Is there a wall?
[248:19.24]Yeah, there is.
[248:19.64]Be careful.
[248:20.08]Alright, uh...
[248:40.46]Got to be prepared for this shit.
[248:41.76]I'm almost out of this.
[248:57.01]Oh, he can see me through the portal.
[249:25.51]Fuck you!
[249:26.47]Oh no, oh no, oh no!
[249:40.99]He's alive?
[249:41.51]Ahhh!
[250:09.24]No, I don't mind if I do.
[250:22.63]That was just fucking mean.
[250:27.21]Hey!
[250:33.41]I love her!
[250:39.56]Don't kill him.
[250:42.46]I'm going to need these.
[250:44.25]I'm going to need these later.
[250:51.57]Meeting room bull.
[250:54.67]Meeting room bull.
[250:57.51]Something going on?
[250:58.30]Is something happening here?
[250:59.34]Hang in there.
[251:06.46]Well, that sure isn't...
[251:09.62]We may need to move out of the way.
[251:11.76]Alright, so what we got... We made it to the front door.
[251:44.70]Oh come on!
[252:14.42]I was trying to be so careful, too.
[252:15.58]Where's the knives?
[252:16.16]I just put them on.
[252:17.10]Your phone number?
[252:17.84]No, no.
[252:18.30]I'm gonna hit that one over there a shitload of times.
[252:38.56]I need, like, a better solution to that.
[252:40.73]I'm going to have to move my lighthouses, I think.
[252:43.21]Because I'm going to fucking break that thing.
[252:44.77]No?
[252:51.19]Okay, here we go.
[252:58.86]Electricity, electricity, electricity.

[258:05.93]No, no, I'm alright.
[258:06.59]I'm going back in.
[258:07.25]I'm going back in.
[258:08.93]I'll be just fine.
[258:09.49]Don't worry about me.
[258:10.15]I'm going to go back in.
[258:13.01]Jeremy, you haven't shown up to work.
[258:15.57]I'm going back in.
[258:17.83]Jeremy, your school called.
[258:19.89]That's alright.
[258:20.39]I'm just going to go back in for like another five minutes.
[258:25.33]Jeremy, you haven't eaten in fucking two days.
[258:29.01]That's alright.
[258:29.49]I'm just going to go back in.
[258:35.26]Hey.
[258:35.50]Friends, don't fear failure.
[258:38.12]As I like to say, failure is simply the chance to start again at the bottom of someone else's company.
[258:44.90]And he loves to work anywhere other than
[258:47.95]Oh, that hurt my head.
[258:48.83]Can I use this?
[258:55.25]Do I need to... No.
[259:03.35]That way.
[259:05.81]8,008.
[259:06.89]Backspot is broken.
[259:08.03]Use John Smith's machine instead.
[259:09.79]What the fuck is the number? 8,008.
[259:20.34]No, 8,000.
[259:20.66]I don't like this office.
[259:47.79]I'm not coming to work tomorrow.
[259:50.91]John Smith's office.
[259:53.81]Let me in.
[259:55.41]Map of pre-production department.
[259:57.87]John Smith, fax room, elevated lobby, mess hall, production department.
[260:01.27]Auxiliary Johns.
[260:05.51]Hello?
[260:14.75]Ah!
[260:33.46]Is there a wall?
[260:33.98]Where's the wall?
[261:10.96]excuse me I like that, I like that back uh oh
[261:53.15]Who shot?
[261:59.96]Who shot?
[262:00.42]Was somebody behind me?
[262:01.52]He was behind me.
[262:13.18]Alright.
[262:14.54]I think it's time to take a break.
[262:19.09]Ugh.
[262:20.19]I'm having too much fun, but I gotta, like, I gotta, like, fucking rest my eyes.
[262:28.61]Rage?
[262:29.07]No, no.
[262:29.69]I'll probably start with this tomorrow.
[262:31.91]There's so many VR games, though.
[262:36.27]Oh, there's so many VR games that I have to play.
[262:41.44]So, we're gonna be tomorrow.
[262:44.06]I'll see you guys tomorrow with more VR.
[262:45.26]So, we're gonna be able to go three days in a row.
[262:48.30]Just because I wanna...
[262:52.12]oh I mentioned like you can't even take me seriously with this like fucking toupee oh my god let's get a real talk going here guys this is like this is a toupee they used to wear back in like the fucking it's 1800. uh
[263:14.37]I got to go get like food and just relax for a little bit.
[263:16.73]Like a couple hours.
[263:18.25]I can only stay inside these things for like four to five hours before like I got to get away from it.
[263:24.44]So tomorrow we're going to pick up again.
[263:26.88]We're going to do more VR tomorrow.
[263:33.72]So I will see you guys tomorrow around 3 to 4 p.m.
[263:39.59]Pacific.
[263:41.75]Get the camera out of here.
[263:45.43]I doubt I could even go that long.
[263:47.71]It really depends on the day.
[263:50.39]Sometimes it's like one hour is enough for me to have to stop, sometimes like four to five.
[263:56.29]You're still in the game?
[263:57.27]Yeah, it saves it, right?
[263:59.52]Do I have to do anything in particular to save the game?
[264:07.58]That was a blast.
[264:09.70]I'm very satisfied.
[264:17.64]Kiwo can stream VR for like 13 hours straight.
[264:20.74]Oh my god.
[264:23.03]How?
[264:24.43]How is it possible?
[264:30.89]13 hours in the helmet?
[264:36.89]Yeah, first impressions of Vive is absolutely worth the money.
[264:40.37]It was a blast.
[264:41.41]I just, I need to like take a few hours after that and just kind of get my eyes off of it.
[264:49.97]But tomorrow, we're going to pick up again.
[264:52.35]I'll see you tomorrow.
[264:57.23]More VR.
[264:57.55]I'm going to get some more games.
[264:58.93]I'm going to get some Beat Saber stuff.
[265:04.92]But I'm tapped out for now.
[265:08.36]By the moving seat.
[265:12.02]This Discord link.
[265:14.03]This coal miner link.
[265:22.32]That's so stupid.
[265:27.76]I'll see you tomorrow.
[265:28.78]We've got some bits to go through.
[265:29.88]I'm going to try a different... I might move the lighthouses because I don't want to break these things.
[265:38.44]And I hit the lighthouse on the back portion of the room twice.
[265:45.65]So, see you tomorrow.
[265:47.85]Let's get the outro on here.
[265:48.99]Let's take that off.
[265:52.79]Thank you for joining me.
[265:55.88]And what do you say we go down here?
[266:04.38]Move as far as I can into the corner.
[266:06.14]Yeah, the only problem is I have a big L-shaped desk.
[266:11.40]And the desk is, uh...
[266:14.15]It kind of takes up a large portion of the back and left wall.
[266:18.67]So trying to get the lighthouses... I mean, the room is big enough to do it.
[266:22.62]And obviously, I was taking at least... What?
[266:26.00]Two or three steps in any given direction without hitting a wall?
[266:32.50]Why do my knees hurt?
[266:33.45]I have, like, red, raw knees.
[266:36.87]What?
[266:38.13]Why?
[266:45.00]Oh, it's from crawling around.
[266:46.14]Alright, so, uh, let's start a few, uh, let's see, about four and a half hours ago.
[266:53.83]We had a ton of gifted subs that came in from Guild Hero.
[266:56.77]I'm not sure if you still hear Guild Hero, but thank you.
[266:58.49]There's like at least 25 to 30 gifted subs here.
[267:02.45]Thanks a lot.
[267:08.67]Yeah, I did lie in the ground.
[267:11.73]But thank you so much, Guild Hero.
[267:14.37]Let's start back here.
[267:19.57]We had... Hey, Alec, thanks for the $1.
[267:24.64]I got the Starry Night Night Sky shirt, and it's epic.
[267:28.86]Yeah, it's a great shirt.
[267:30.38]I highly recommend it.
[267:33.60]If you don't know what I'm talking about, if you just have a Teespring store, a couple of shirts are there.
[267:38.43]If you feel like buying them, cool.
[267:41.29]They're very, very well made.
[267:42.39]The designs are very good.
[267:45.37]It is available.
[267:51.51]Wow, we just went to zero.
[267:54.43]That was like a full-on zero.
[267:57.85]Damn, okay.
[267:58.59]Well, refresh, I guess.
[268:00.51]That was weird.
[268:02.93]But yeah, the shirts are available.
[268:04.39]They're really cool.
[268:07.02]I highly recommend them.
[268:09.69]Uh, thank you Sad Vega for the one dollar.
[268:11.29]So I did the idiot remark at Taco Bell while ordering food.
[268:14.07]I said, I'll have cheese gordita crunch, idiot.
[268:17.30]They looked at me for a second in shock.
[268:19.48]Then I repeated it and the manager came and told me to apologize and leave or he'd call the police.
[268:23.64]I apologized profusely and blamed you, saying you were encouraging people to do it.
[268:29.04]He looked at me and said, if he told you to jump off a bridge, would you?
[268:32.18]And I said, yes.
[268:35.89]Uh, here's the thing, though.
[268:37.51]I explicitly told everybody NOT to do that, because it was incredibly rude, and it wasn't a nice thing to do.
[268:48.92]Sorry to hear that you got reprimanded at Taco Bell for being what any normal person would see as being a dick.
[268:58.20]But thank you for the one dollar.
[269:01.22]Uh, Raise and Rise, thanks for the three bucks.
[269:03.73]Divas, thanks for the two bucks.
[269:06.14]Dork Cube, thanks for the $1.
[269:07.46]My dad always said, measure twice, cut once.
[269:10.33]But this stream proved that sometimes, even when you measure 10 times, you may still slice your finger off.
[269:20.60]I'm getting a feel for the room, too.
[269:23.04]Because remember, this is the first time I've ever experienced VR.
[269:27.64]Standing up with a Vive.
[269:29.77]My only real experience was PSVR, and I had to stand in the same spot.
[269:35.01]So you guys watched live my first real ever room VR experience.
[269:40.85]So you kind of have to get used to it.
[269:45.95]Do I still have PSVR?
[269:47.05]I do not.
[269:48.49]I actually gave it to a friend.
[269:51.10]So I no longer have access to it.
[269:52.84]But now I have a Vive, so... There's really no reason I don't think to have it.
[269:58.64]There are a few PSVR exclusives that look interesting, but... I have a Vive, so anytime I want to do VR, I'm just going to use that.
[270:07.61]But thank you, DoorQ.
[270:08.97]Good advice.
[270:10.53]Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the $1.
[270:12.89]And you say...
[270:15.64]Hey, Jeremy, can you do a stream where you just watch Willem Dafoe talk about himself for 30 minutes?
[270:19.18]Willem Dafoe breaks down his most iconic character for 35 minutes.
[270:26.90]Um, well, no.
[270:27.78]35 minutes.
[270:41.98]I would watch that on your own time.
[270:43.10]It's probably great.
[270:44.82]He's one of the greatest actors we've ever seen.
[270:49.22]But thank you, Superintendent Chalmers.
[270:50.40]Thank you, DeviantXS, for the one dollar.
[270:52.60]Might be a good idea to put some straps on, bro.
[270:56.90]Smashly, thanks for the four community subs earlier.
[270:59.58]Tiggy, thanks for the one dollar.
[271:01.62]You had us in the first half with the most fun thing you've ever done, until you mentioned riding roller coasters.
[271:07.13]Everyone knows you must be this tall to ride.
[271:14.87]You know that you could be like 48 inches tall and still qualify for like the Superman ride of steel.
[271:23.52]You know that, right?
[271:25.50]So even if I was like four foot six, I would still qualify for the Superman ride.
[271:33.85]That's not true.
[271:34.49]What are you talking about?
[271:38.30]Five goddamn eight.
[271:39.50]Five nine with heels on.
[271:42.67]Thank you.
[271:43.03]Trust no one for the three bucks.
[271:45.38]Hello, Jeremy.
[271:45.90]It's me again.
[271:46.58]Last time we met, I was kind of obliged to follow the same road as I had before.
[271:52.02]That's all because of you.
[271:52.90]Let's see where this road leads us this time.
[271:54.64]Let's see where this road leads us.
[272:01.35]Uh, this is 11 scariest germs caught by drones.
[272:07.21]Wait, what?
[272:09.50]What the fuck is this?
[272:11.26]I...
[272:13.97]Hold on.
[272:14.23]I gotta play.
[272:14.79]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[272:18.57]Let me see.
[272:24.24]Is Willem Dafoe's video still playing?
[272:28.96]Oh, I see what's going on.
[272:29.82]Okay, I have to get the HTC Vive.
[272:32.06]I'm gonna go to my regular speakers.
[272:35.29]Okay, there we go.
[272:39.17]Now this should be playing.
[272:40.67]Alright.
[272:44.63]Shit, why can I not hear this?
[272:49.29]Yeah, the Vive kind of takes over your whole setup.
[272:51.17]It takes over your mic, takes over your headphones.
[272:54.91]Let me just put this back to, okay, is that better?
[273:02.66]There we go, okay, now I can hear this.
[273:04.16]Alright, we're gonna put this on.
[273:05.70]Let's do a browser capture here and let's just watch this.
[273:12.02]Because I am just chilling right now.
[273:14.20]Just trying to relax out of the VR.
[273:16.26]Let's watch a video.
[273:24.01]This is the 11 scariest drones.
[273:27.61]Let's go.
[273:29.67]11 scariest things caught by drones.
[273:32.35]Watch it.
[273:33.85]I'm not going to watch that.
[273:36.15]No.
[273:41.43]This is going to turn into the same joke again.
[273:45.51]Yeah, this is the dirtiest hit.
[273:54.41]This is a great Buzzfeed video.
[274:07.28]Is that a demonic?
[274:11.99]Oh, come on.
[274:19.80]How is that a drone?
[274:25.16]He was testing his new drone in the forest.
[274:29.46]What a terrifying man these are.
[274:39.84]That's not even me.
[274:43.50]Loch Ness is famous for its myth of water smells
[275:16.90]Not an employee.
[275:19.84]That guy just climbed in the fucking window and just started using the computer.
[275:40.82]The next drone footage was too gruesome.
[275:42.76]While in the air, the whole balloon crew were being eaten alive by this thing.
[276:00.84]You had to crop, you had to frame by frame crop that shit up.
[276:26.29]That was wonderful.
[276:30.75]Jeremy, please forgive me if I got you upset by using your image in such unpleasant ways.
[276:35.00]I didn't mean it.
[276:36.62]No, that's fine.
[276:38.22]This guy did.
[276:40.52]Probably.
[276:43.81]Hey, look, I wonder what's gonna happen in like a week.
[276:49.47]News bloopers!
[276:54.31]And no, I'm not going to watch that video.
[276:57.85]So, not going to watch the best 2017 news bloopers.
[277:03.59]See you in a week or two when we watch another one of these.
[277:10.85]I'm not going to watch news bloopers.
[277:17.09]The cycle continues.
[277:20.44]That was fucking hilarious.
[277:22.10]That was great.
[277:23.58]Thank you for that.
[277:27.18]That was really, really, really fucking funny.
[277:29.70]Thank you, trust no one.
[277:30.68]Put $3 in that video.
[277:34.96]Jess, you got it.
[277:35.66]Thanks for the $1.
[277:36.42]You look like a chimney sweep.
[277:38.85]Mm-hmm.
[277:41.21]I gotta go, like, wash my face.
[277:42.31]I gotta get in the shower and, like, condition my hair.
[277:48.99]Thank you, SuperSeal, for the $2.50.
[277:50.89]Drink orange juice after brushing your teeth on stream or scared.
[277:54.48]That's gonna ruin orange juice for me.
[277:59.08]I don't put alcohol in my orange juice, and I don't brush my teeth and drink orange juice, because it ruins it.
[278:08.57]I also need to look up how to clean the inside of your Vive visor, because it is disgusting.
[278:15.89]If somebody was here and they had a cotton, like, swab or something, or like a Q-tip, and you just went, you dragged across the front of that glass in there, you would have enough to probably make a whole nother, like, species of fucking mutants.
[278:30.27]It's filthy in there.
[278:34.78]But thank you, SuperSeal.
[278:35.64]Thank you again.
[278:36.12]FrodeonWeapon gave $50 earlier.
[278:37.52]Thank you so much again.
[278:41.26]Big money from Frodeon.
[278:43.45]Timmy Tim Tim, thanks for the $1.
[278:44.73]They say crazy person.
[278:51.57]Crazy person.
[278:52.53]No, this is just somebody playing VR.
[278:56.62]Okay, if I didn't have the VR helmet or the helmet hair, I need a haircut.
[279:05.56]Look at that.
[279:06.00]Look at that fucking helmet bedhead hair.
[279:12.96]No, that's somebody just playing VR.
[279:15.54]But thank you, TimmyTimTim.
[279:17.46]Uh, Guild Hero, again, huge amount of community subs.
[279:20.64]Renex, thanks for the five dollars.
[279:22.72]After you download mod installer, you can download songs in-game.
[279:25.94]Okay, cool.
[279:27.16]I'll get that set up before we stream tomorrow.
[279:31.08]Uh, thank you, Gibbler, for the three bucks.
[279:32.97]Jerma, I didn't know that you were a coal miner.
[279:35.47]That's the one we just looked at.
[279:40.01]That's fucking wild.
[279:41.51]Thank you so much, Gibbler.
[279:44.43]Mentosium, thanks for the $4.20.
[279:46.07]Hey, Jerma, got you featured on the Yogscast Jingle Jam.
[279:49.43]Was wondering if you've seen Harder, Better, Faster jermaOn YouTube.
[279:52.60]I think you'll enjoy it.
[279:56.20]I think I do remember the Yogscast thing.
[279:58.76]It was green screen footage, right?
[280:03.26]It was good shit.
[280:05.94]I'm here.
[280:06.20]I'm right here.
[280:06.64]I'm right here.
[280:06.98]You don't have to beep.
[280:07.51]You don't have to beep.
[280:09.61]I'm here.
[280:12.19]Better, Faster, Jerma.
[280:12.89]I think... Did we watch that, like, last week or something?
[280:18.22]The name is familiar.
[280:19.06]I'm not sure if I... Maybe we have.
[280:24.18]No, me.
[280:25.28]I vaguely remember.
[280:26.42]I don't think we did.
[280:34.83]Better, Faster... Hold on.
[280:36.07]What's it called?
[280:37.77]Better, Faster...
[280:42.10]Harder, better, faster, Jerma.
[280:43.54]Let me take a look and see.
[280:57.55]Oh, it's a green screen video, okay.
[281:07.18]I'm gonna save this and I know I've said this a bunch of times but the green screen encore stream is actually gonna happen here probably next week or the like the week after it's actually gonna happen I've talked about it for like the last three and a half weeks and it's time to actually compile them and do like another encore green screen night so in like maybe like a maybe like two weeks
[281:36.54]I'm actually going to talk to the mods about it.
[281:38.57]We'll figure it out again.
[281:43.43]But this one is not another submissions thing as much as it is like a couple hours of ones that have come out since.
[281:51.51]So it's not going to be another... Alright, here's a ton of submissions here.
[281:54.31]We're going to watch like 500 videos.
[281:57.21]I'd like to keep it a little... Maybe we'll do it at the end of one stream in particular.
[282:03.02]Might be fun to do.
[282:06.18]It's like Christmas morning.
[282:07.41]My hair, if I grab the front of my hair and if I pulled even with like a quarter of a pound of pressure, the whole tuft is going to come out.
[282:19.39]I'm going to have to do like a treatment to my head.
[282:24.82]But we will watch that.
[282:25.74]I will make sure it's saved.
[282:26.96]I'll bookmark it.
[282:29.16]Because green screen stuff I'd like to watch in a better setting where we're all ready for it.
[282:38.77]But thank you so much, Mentosium.
[282:43.48]We will see it soon.
[282:46.78]Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the $4.
[282:49.26]Random question, but I'm making a video game themed workout playlist.
[282:53.02]Any action-y game OSTs you could recommend?
[282:56.38]Love the VR stuff.
[282:57.06]Can't wait to see the upcoming craziness.
[282:59.20]Have a good night.
[283:04.19]A video game themed... Any action-y game OSTs?
[283:11.47]I mean, the easy one is probably Hotline.
[283:12.77]Somebody already said it.
[283:14.21]Hotline Miami is really, you know, will really pump you up.
[283:19.20]Both OSTs.
[283:20.04]I would just get them both.
[283:27.16]Any other OSTs?
[283:28.40]That's what I would say those first.
[283:34.37]Doom.
[283:34.81]Doom is more... Maybe.
[283:38.27]Maybe.
[283:41.86]Just go get the whole Smash Brothers.
[283:44.92]Go get the entire Smash Brothers OST.
[283:50.60]But yeah, probably I would say Hotline Miami.
[283:54.12]Flammable Cow, thanks for the $5.
[283:55.18]I recently started playing Chrono Trigger after you mentioned it and enjoyed it.
[283:59.50]I didn't have the privilege of growing up in the boomer generation and was wondering what's an old underrated game that you recommend.
[284:05.13]Much love, The Neighborhood.
[284:07.23]I'll say that every single time.
[284:09.09]Mario RPG, Chrono Trigger, The Neverhood.
[284:12.60]Some of the other old ones.
[284:16.88]That's probably top three.
[284:20.88]It's really hard to get a hold of The Neverhood, though.
[284:27.19]Earthworm Jim.
[284:28.09]I don't know if I... I'm not so sure Earthworm Jim still holds up.
[284:34.01]It's been a long time since I played it, but I remember trying to play it again within the last five or so years, and it was like, I wasn't really enjoying it.
[284:46.38]The soundtrack for Earthworm Jim is amazing.
[284:51.20]But The Neverhood is... I just love that game.
[284:59.20]Add Desert Bus VR to the games to play tomorrow.
[285:03.12]Well, I want to go through the most requested ones first.
[285:07.58]Because stuff like Blade and Sorcery, Beat Saber, Budget Cuts, like SUPERHOT VR, there's a couple of like the... There's at least like five that people really, really wanted to see and that I was really wanting to play.
[285:23.27]So we'll do some other weird random ones after we go through like the top ones.
[285:30.44]Gorn.
[285:31.24]Yeah, Gorn's another one.
[285:36.83]Yeah, there's so many to play that I don't want to really overwhelm myself because here's what's going to happen, right?
[285:43.94]So when we're doing these VR streams...
[285:49.70]I'd like to only do like a few of them each night.
[285:53.56]Maybe like two or three of them each night because I want to get the whole experience from these games.
[285:59.42]I don't want to just open like budget cuts and play for 20 minutes and be like, alright, what's the next one?
[286:03.82]I got like 15 of these.
[286:04.86]It's not like the PlayStation 2 streams or the Dreamcast stuff.
[286:08.93]I want to give each one at least like a couple hours or like at least one to two hours so I can get the whole experience out of them.
[286:19.52]And I'm not exactly sure how long something like budget cuts is, but it feels like I'm getting at least enough of a package there where I've had enough fun in it, where I'm ready to do something else.
[286:34.33]But we'll see.
[286:36.70]I will have another list of about three or four, maybe three or so tomorrow.
[286:44.02]But thank you, Flammable Cow.
[286:45.02]Thank you, Buster Boy, for the three bucks.
[286:47.14]How can I gift you Steam games?
[286:48.52]There's a game called Jet Island that is an amazing VR game that I'd like you to play.
[286:53.49]You don't have to do any gifting or anything like that.
[286:57.31]If you have a recommendation for a game, I have a Discord.
[287:01.29]If you want to go to the Discord, there's a recommended channel.
[287:04.91]You can go there and just put anything that you think you'd like to see on stream.
[287:09.68]It's not a discussion channel.
[287:11.94]It's just a place to put recommendations.
[287:14.40]And I look at it all the time.
[287:16.16]I look at the recommended channel at least once a week.
[287:19.02]And I kind of scroll up and see what's been said.
[287:20.82]And if I want to do something and I, you know, pinpoint things that I'd like to do.
[287:25.19]So, yeah.
[287:26.47]Recommend a channel in the Discord.
[287:28.37]If you have anything you'd like me to check out.
[287:31.07]But thank you.
[287:32.15]BusterBoy for the three bucks.
[287:34.51]Hey, something or other, and there's no music, is there?
[287:37.15]No, get back here.
[287:39.59]Something or other, thanks for the $1.
[287:40.81]Agent Smith voice.
[287:42.29]You can't escape the Matrix, Mr. Elbertson.
[287:47.37]I'll get out.
[287:52.53]Hey, for real though, thanks for the $2.50.
[287:53.99]Did you eat your Rice Krispies this morning?
[287:57.07]Did I eat my Rice Krispies?
[288:01.66]Kellogg's Rice Krispies.
[288:03.12]It's the only cereal that talks to you, and that makes for a great company in the morning.
[288:07.45]How do you know we don't just fucking run?
[288:09.03]I don't know what that is.
[288:16.79]I don't know if I want to play that.
[288:18.03]I don't know what that is, but thank you for the $2.50.
[288:24.53]Because, you know, living one life sucks enough.
[288:27.17]Going through the hardships of one life is bad enough, but to do it again...
[288:32.24]God I read this pamphlet at my doctor's office one time There it is you get into you really do see context there's no context of the audio It's just that makes no sense.
[288:50.71]It'll make perfect sense if you watch it.
[288:52.53]Oh
[288:54.95]Thank you for real, though.
[288:55.87]Thank you, Tingy, for the $1 on my last bit, so I might as well use them before it goes to $2.50.
[288:58.89]Just want to say that I love this community and you, Jerma.
[289:02.00]You guys make each stream a great experience.
[289:05.28]Thank you so much, Tingy.
[289:07.56]Yeah, the $2.50 minimum is just... It's just going to happen here probably tomorrow.
[289:14.48]I will probably continue to read...
[289:20.01]under 250 for at least maybe like one or two more streams after the change just because there's no way with the amount of people that are here that everybody will know you know what I'm saying so it's changing tomorrow but I'm going to continue to read under 250 for at least another two or three streams because I mean it's hard to keep everybody aware what's going on
[289:50.95]But thank you for the $1.
[289:55.25]It's a pleasure to have as many great people here as there are.
[289:58.85]So, thank you.
[290:01.39]Put it in the stream title.
[290:04.07]Maybe.
[290:04.45]I don't know if I want to, like, blow it up the stream title.
[290:06.49]Though it already has, like, the shirts thing there.
[290:09.03]And I don't want to be, like, one of those, you know, like... Exclamation point shirts!
[290:12.43]Exclamation point stream changes!
[290:13.87]Exclamation point prime!
[290:15.23]Exclamation point... Once you start adding exclamation points, they just keep going.
[290:23.62]Everyone knows about the shirts, though.
[290:24.86]It's not necessarily true.
[290:29.39]But thank you, Tingy.
[290:31.37]Thank you, Rajasil, for the $1.
[290:33.23]Hey, Jerma, I've been standing outside your window trying to get your attention for about two hours.
[290:36.95]But you're not noticing me.
[290:37.83]I've been revving up my engine and honking my horn and everything.
[290:42.44]Well, you did get my attention.
[290:43.46]I didn't know it was you.
[290:46.38]But thank you for the one dollar.
[290:47.20]Thank you Clueless Sniper for the one dollar!
[290:49.46]Appreciate it, thank you.
[290:51.30]And finally here we add a dollar for a multi-trip.
[290:54.32]I don't know if it's on the list, but you should definitely play Hot Dogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades.
[290:58.24]It's basically like that first game you played, but with guns and tons of game modes.
[291:05.97]Absolutely.
[291:08.96]I am 100% on board with any and all of these really, really interesting VR games.
[291:16.00]Because I am... You know what?
[291:17.38]It's great.
[291:18.70]It's like... Okay, so if you... I'm like two and a half, three years late to this shit.
[291:26.22]There's such a huge compiling of awesome VR games.
[291:30.02]This has to be what it feels like.
[291:32.16]If you're... Let's say you're like 11, 12, 13 years old right now.
[291:36.64]You grow up, you know, you're 13, you turn 14, 15, get your Steam account.
[291:40.50]When you're, you've got like, think of all the shit that like a 15, 16 year old that gets their hand on Steam for the first time.
[291:47.72]This backlog of a decade of incredible experiences that they have.
[291:54.67]Wow.
[291:58.46]That's how I feel right now.
[291:59.40]I feel like I'm 12.
[292:00.42]I just made my Steam account.
[292:03.31]And, Radgesil, if you're gonna drive by, at least, like, make it, uh, know it's you.
[292:08.23]Uh, but, I feel like I'm 12.
[292:11.91]And I just made my first ever Steam account.
[292:13.29]And, like, The Witcher 3.
[292:15.49]Holy shit, I've never, what's that one?
[292:17.67]What, there's three of these?
[292:18.43]I can play one, two, and three?
[292:20.59]I don't even know what this is.
[292:23.95]What's this game?
[292:24.41]The Team Fortress?
[292:26.07]What the fuck is that thing?
[292:28.57]I've never even been inside this game once.
[292:31.66]That's how I feel right now with VR.
[292:36.78]By the way, I've never played through any of The Witcher games.
[292:39.36]I'm just pretending to think they're cool so people will think I'm, you know, they can pretend to think I'm cool.
[292:44.74]That's the only reason why I said that.
[292:51.32]I'm just pretending to know what they are.
[292:57.34]You are not cool.
[293:02.61]It has a horse?
[293:06.67]And at the very end here, we got Double D. Doubled 11 for the $2 here.
[293:12.42]Hey, are you also going to do VRChat with Kiwo?
[293:15.25]Yes.
[293:15.89]But that's going to have to be at a different time.
[293:19.31]Because I was told, I was under the impression, I think that Kiwo is not available.
[293:24.61]I think that Kiwo is doing something.
[293:26.71]She's gone or not around or something.
[293:30.57]I was going to get the VRChat tutorial from Kiwo as a stream.
[293:35.65]That is not going to be part of this, you know, two or three streams in a row of VR.
[293:40.52]That's going to be, I just have it and when we can... Because remember, she's EU, right?
[293:45.78]So that's going to be a little fucky trying to get that to work because I am like almost eight to ten hours behind her.
[293:55.75]So we'll figure it out.
[294:01.50]But I look forward to the VR tutorial.
[294:08.29]Streams like 12 hours a day.
[294:11.51]God, I wish I had the energy.
[294:12.49]Like, I put, like, laser beams into my eyes for four hours, and I have to, like, go lie down.
[294:20.18]And they all say, I have a 200-word essay due, and I'm here watching Jerma.
[294:22.74]What am I doing?
[294:24.26]You added 50 words.
[294:26.64]Hey, BusterBoy, thanks for the $1 at the very end.
[294:28.40]I got my Oculus Rift a month ago and I know exactly what you're saying.
[294:31.28]Yeah, it's great.
[294:34.42]I have like a year and a half worth of experiences that I haven't done.
[294:38.68]So it feels great.
[294:41.96]And let's run the credits.
[294:42.84]That's the end of the bits.
[294:49.46]I will see you find a group of people.
[294:54.25]Tomorrow.
[294:57.96]Tomorrow is the day for more VR.
[295:05.49]He's pretending that joke wasn't made in the last stream.
[295:14.45]Really short post-stream today.
[295:16.97]Yeah, I gotta figure it's because of VR.
[295:20.43]Because the stream labs wasn't really on, I can't really see anything anyways.
[295:28.60]But no, it's all good.
[295:31.00]It's good shit.
[295:31.42]Are you going to have OVR drop working next time?
[295:36.00]Do you need any help to get it attached to your hand?
[295:39.43]I might.
[295:41.21]I didn't really do a proper tutorial, so... I did get the chat to be on the screen, but I want to get it in that position.
[295:48.23]But here's the weird part though, right?
[295:50.34]So getting the chat on your hand, wouldn't that conflict with doing actions in the game?
[295:57.80]So let's say I was in budget cuts, right?
[296:00.46]How do I make it so I... Because I have the gun on my hand.
[296:03.46]Oh, I lift up my hand.
[296:04.42]There's the gun.
[296:06.78]Is the chat just always going to be on the hand?
[296:12.01]Or do I have to do like a certain... I have to rotate my hand to see it.
[296:16.69]Okay.
[296:17.11]Okay.
[296:19.16]Yeah, I plan on watching a couple of tutorials, but if I'm still having trouble, then I'll be in the Discord.
[296:23.78]You bet your ass tomorrow at like 2.30 I'll be in the Discord like, Look, I tried it and I don't understand how it worked.
[296:35.65]But I'm gonna give it a try.
[296:37.63]Hey, Pigeon, thanks for the $1.
[296:39.75]Just got my interviews with mods and newbie done, and I'm ready to start banging out that essay.
[296:44.17]Sort of.
[296:44.55]I need to compile that information into sections.
[296:48.14]Make sure you use the quote where I said, eat your vegetables, eat plenty of high-quality proteins like salmon and tuna fish.
[296:56.62]And if you're going to work out, make sure you give yourself enough rest.
[297:02.28]You know, if you work out, let's say you lift and you do bicep curls, don't do bicep curls for at least like three, four days.
[297:08.60]Let your body recover, get that high-quality protein, and that's how you do good working out.
[297:16.12]For... Wait, that was... Okay, that was... You could still use that quote anyways.
[297:18.91]Just use a section of that and use it as a quote.
[297:22.41]What are the plans on the Encore green screen night?
[297:23.97]We just were talking about it.
[297:25.91]We were talking about how it's probably gonna happen in a couple weeks.
[297:28.39]I said that really fast.
[297:30.28]Too fast.
[297:30.76]I gotta slow down.
[297:37.30]Just eat french fries only.
[297:38.98]And only french fries and you'll be fine.
[297:43.63]That is very bad advice.
[297:51.52]Hey, that's me.
[297:54.87]Hey, double D thanks for the $1.
[297:56.41]It's a YouTube link.
[297:57.29]Let's see what it is.
[298:01.31]I want one bit of Jerma wisdom.
[298:03.89]That's what we're going to do.
[298:06.49]It's a lot.
[298:06.95]It's a lot of value.
[298:11.26]That's pretty good wisdom.
[298:12.06]You know?
[298:15.40]Don't.
[298:16.92]Be careful.
[298:20.83]You're not gonna get out.
[298:26.42]Alright, guys.
[298:27.42]I will see you tomorrow with more VR.
[298:29.60]I'm gonna clean up.
[298:30.36]I'm gonna clean my shit up.
[298:32.95]There's shit all over the place.
[298:33.81]I gotta clean it up.
[298:35.71]And the VR helmet needs a little bit of TLC here.
[298:39.13]I'm gonna take a shower.
[298:42.95]See you tomorrow.
[298:43.51]Have a great rest of your night.
[298:45.80]Take care.
[298:47.10]And ta-ta.
[299:05.44]Thank you.
