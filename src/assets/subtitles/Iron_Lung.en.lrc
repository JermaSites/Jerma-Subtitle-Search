[00:05.42]Hey, how are you?
[00:08.10]Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[00:09.76]Listen, I don't know what it is about my body.
[00:13.83]I don't know why my body does this or why it's like this.
[00:17.63]Well, I mean, I think I could take a guess.
[00:20.39]At like 3.58, almost every day, I have to go to the bathroom.
[00:27.05]It's something the way that, like, my pipes are in my body.
[00:30.17]It's just like, alright, okay, 355.
[00:32.18]Let's go.
[00:32.60]356.
[00:32.62]Okay.
[00:33.98]357.
[00:34.36]I gotta go.
[00:37.48]It happens every day.
[00:40.18]You know what I have to start doing?
[00:42.66]I have to start just make... I've gotta start eating an hour earlier.
[00:46.85]At least.
[00:49.71]Yes, I... Yeah, hold on.
[00:51.43]I know.
[00:51.87]My microphone is changed.
[00:55.19]I... Well, we're gonna work on it in a minute.
[01:00.04]My microphone, I fucked with a bunch of settings.
[01:03.37]So, I'm trying to figure out how fucked up it is.
[01:06.63]I'm peaking?
[01:10.25]You sound like the Joker?
[01:14.99]Sounds fine.
[01:20.17]How does it sound?
[01:22.75]It's really loud?
[01:25.32]Yeah, I mean, I've taken the criticism.
[01:29.83]I turned myself way up, and I made sure that I was loud as fuck now.
[01:35.09]You know what I'm saying?
[01:41.96]He went from being way too quiet to really fucking loud.
[01:45.44]Does it sound alright?
[01:49.58]Should I drop it a little bit?
[01:50.56]Because I have... Let me see what happens if I do this.
[01:54.24]I sound louder?
[01:56.52]Let me know if this is a better place.
[01:58.86]Is this better?
[02:00.97]Dropping the gain a little bit.
[02:01.99]How does it sound?
[02:05.31]Better?
[02:07.61]Is it fine?
[02:09.63]You sound like you're canned.
[02:12.19]I'm canned.
[02:18.91]You know what I think I want to do one of these days?
[02:20.67]Maybe even today, I don't know.
[02:22.73]Is just do a stream where I sit there and just mess with settings until you guys give me all thumbs up emotes.
[02:27.71]And I have another dead pixel on this monitor and it's really not making me happy, I'll tell you.
[02:40.30]What do the mods say?
[02:44.06]Okay, let me ask you this.
[02:45.74]Do I sound better or worse than I did two days ago?
[02:54.91]Better or worse than two days ago?
[02:59.00]Better with question marks.
[03:00.96]Okay, I need to test this too, because I need to make sure I'm not going to hurt anybody if I, like, do, like, the patented Jerma985 yell at the thing on screen.
[03:08.12]I'm going to yell, and I want to see if the compressor catches it, because I need to make sure that happens, because I don't want to hurt anybody's ears.
[03:13.93]So turn me down a little bit, and let's test this to see how bad this sounds.
[03:16.89]Okay, you ready?
[03:21.85]I'm going to make a loud sound.
[03:23.71]I'm warning you alright now.
[03:27.15]What the?
[03:27.77]What is that?
[03:28.99]What is that guy?
[03:30.23]Oh my god!
[03:31.29]He just killed me!
[03:33.11]Bad.
[03:39.64]Are we okay?
[03:40.36]Did it catch it?
[03:41.18]Did it not?
[03:45.50]Is that right?
[03:48.70]That's not a fan?
[03:49.10]Alright, cool.
[03:49.40]Yeah, because when you mess with a compressor like this, or you mess with audio settings, if I yell and the compressor doesn't catch it, it's actually going to be bad, and it'll be really way too loud and just fuck up everything, so.
[04:03.63]Alright, alright, alright, let's go!
[04:05.79]Alright!
[04:06.07]So here's the plan, here's what we're doing today.
[04:09.47]Today, today, we are going to be doing Iron Lung.
[04:21.18]Which people have been saying, you got to do that, you got to play it.
[04:23.60]I believe this is by the Dusk devs.
[04:27.14]Or Dusk dev.
[04:29.48]So, it's only an hour long.
[04:31.42]This is only like maybe an hour to two hours long.
[04:33.50]Total.
[04:36.22]I loved Dusk.
[04:37.66]I thought Dusk was one of my... You know what?
[04:39.52]Thinking back to Dusk...
[04:43.24]I would put that probably high up on some of my favorite games I've played on stream.
[04:46.85]That game was so much fun.
[04:48.57]It was great.
[04:49.09]It was unbelievable.
[04:51.03]So, I mean, obviously, if the person that made Dusk or the group that made Dusk, I want to play their other game.
[05:02.12]But it's only going to be like an hour or so.
[05:04.82]This game is not like Dusk.
[05:06.09]Oh, no, I know, I know.
[05:08.45]I know it's a scary, scary game.
[05:10.15]I know it's very scary.
[05:11.11]There's going to be a face cam.
[05:12.31]Okay, look at the streamer.
[05:13.41]He got really scared.
[05:16.99]So, we'll do kind of like a scary game thing today.
[05:20.70]Then after that, we're going to play Glover.
[05:24.60]For the N64.
[05:25.34]They ported it to Steam.
[05:28.40]And here we go again.
[05:30.72]Glover was ported to Steam.
[05:33.15]And it was voted on by pre-stream chat.
[05:34.97]So, that's what we're going to do.
[05:42.08]And then if Glover sucks, and I gotta tell you, uh, Glove Buddies, the same rules are going to apply for Glover when I kind of, I mean, maybe, we'll see.
[05:53.69]If I love the game and I think it's like the most fun I've ever had, I'm gonna keep playing it.
[05:57.01]But after an hour or two in Glover, the strawberry magic rules are gonna apply.
[06:01.88]And we're gonna have to see how powerful the Glove Buddies are.
[06:07.72]You are sus.
[06:08.66]Yes.
[06:10.02]Ha ha ha.
[06:12.70]But, okay, first thing is first.
[06:17.74]Wits play Iron Lung, right?
[06:20.22]Because that's what we're doing.
[06:24.55]What about eating a glove?
[06:25.87]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[06:27.01]Alright, let me address that.
[06:27.99]Alright, let me address it.
[06:30.47]I'll address it.
[06:31.35]I gotta tweet this.
[06:31.99]I'll address it in a second.
[06:32.69]Be right back.
[07:25.69]Okay.
[07:27.59]So, um, a couple of years ago, I made a comment saying, uh, maybe embarrassingly, that the Three Stooges were going to be added to Fortnite by April 24th, uh, 2022.
[07:42.98]And, I mean, that was probably back in, like, 2019 or so.
[07:48.30]And I said I would bet anything.
[07:52.22]And what I bet was...
[07:57.03]uh I bet that I would eat a glove on stream um if they weren't in the game by by tomorrow so uh so we'll see we'll see what happens well we'll see we'll see you know we'll see what happens they could they could get added tomorrow it's possible we'll see
[08:29.20]So, if they're not adding, and look, it's probably like a licensing issue, right?
[08:32.88]They probably were going to.
[08:33.92]It's a licensing problem.
[08:36.82]Without a doubt.
[08:40.08]So, I'm sure they tried to add the Three Stooges, but Paramount Pictures or whatever, probably whoever owns Three Stooges were like, nah, we want a little bit, whatever the drama behind the scenes was to make it so they weren't in the game.
[08:52.48]I don't know.
[08:55.68]But I'm going to have to eat a glove eventually here.
[09:01.24]Alright, I'm going to play around with some audio settings.
[09:02.68]You guys let me know how it sounds.
[09:04.26]You ready?
[09:07.26]Let's do a couple of tests.
[09:09.46]You ready?
[09:09.72]Here we go.
[09:11.71]Here's the first test.
[09:14.77]Hi, guys.
[09:17.33]This is Jerma.
[09:18.21]Hold on.
[09:21.25]Hey, guys.
[09:21.93]It's me, Jerma985.
[09:23.78]Coming to you from my studio.
[09:26.70]And I'm ready to say hi.
[09:27.66]I'm ready to say what's going on.
[09:29.52]Ready to
[09:31.30]Check in on how everybody's doing.
[09:35.54]How are we?
[09:35.76]Are we good?
[09:36.20]How are we?
[09:40.58]Is it better than it just was?
[09:45.60]In his studio.
[09:48.63]Is that actually better?
[09:49.41]The mic is too hot.
[09:51.99]Alright, so how about... How about now?
[09:55.59]How's everybody doing?
[09:56.17]It's me, Jerma985, here coming at you from my studio.
[09:58.97]Wanna check in on how everybody's doing.
[10:04.26]Want to see how crispy this sounds, how crunchy it might sound?
[10:09.87]It's a podcast.
[10:11.29]Wait, good?
[10:12.27]You guys can't say good to everything.
[10:15.66]These are too bassy.
[10:17.08]Alright, hold on.
[10:17.76]How about... How does this sound?
[10:23.33]Hey guys, it's me, Jerma, coming at you here from my studio.
[10:28.71]Just checking to see how crunchy this sounds.
[10:33.87]If we've got some opinions on how I sound, I would love to hear them.
[10:39.13]They sound the same.
[10:42.79]Test with a wheeze laugh.
[10:43.83]Okay.
[10:48.19]Better?
[10:48.43]First one was better?
[10:53.12]Sounds like you're very ugly.
[10:54.38]Oh, dude, I don't know about this one.
[10:59.67]You sound really ugly.
[11:03.89]The first one was... Okay, wait.
[11:06.55]How about now?
[11:08.95]How about now?
[11:09.61]Hi, guys.
[11:10.71]How's everybody doing?
[11:12.35]We having a good time here?
[11:13.25]We chilling?
[11:16.39]This is shit now, okay?
[11:20.54]How about this?
[11:21.28]Hey guys!
[11:22.48]How we doing now?
[11:23.09]We chilling?
[11:23.81]Having a good time?
[11:25.57]Everybody having a relaxing evening?
[11:27.55]I'm seeing a lot of betters.
[11:30.87]I'm seeing a lot of betters.
[11:36.13]Let me see what this sounds like.
[11:37.64]Hey.
[11:38.42]How does it sound?
[11:38.88]Hey guys, how you doing?
[11:39.92]Oh fuck, this actually sounds like shit.
[11:41.30]Hold on.
[11:42.48]Hey guys!
[11:43.56]Hey guys!
[11:44.88]Hey guys!
[11:45.56]Hey guys!
[11:46.22]Hey guys!
[11:46.84]Hey guys!
[11:47.42]Hey guys!
[11:50.18]Hey everybody, how's everybody doing?
[11:51.94]My name is Jerma985.
[11:52.80]Hi everybody, how you doing?
[11:56.34]My name is Jerma985.
[11:57.20]This is so fucked up.
[12:00.81]Look, you can like change, you can change how you sound.
[12:04.25]It's so, like look at this.
[12:05.35]This is ridiculous.
[12:08.01]Okay, I actually think this one might be the best one.
[12:12.01]If everyone wants to disagree, they can.
[12:13.47]I think this actually might be pretty good.
[12:17.13]Are we in agreement that this one sounds better?
[12:22.10]To me, this one sounds fine.
[12:23.38]This one sounds okay.
[12:26.98]Yeah, I think this is fine.
[12:28.20]For now.
[12:29.36]I'll figure it out.
[12:31.20]You're a bad audio quality streamer.
[12:37.12]He's trolling?
[12:37.88]No, I'm not.
[12:38.38]I'm scrolling on shit.
[12:40.60]I think this actually sounds fine.
[12:42.24]Can I get a confirmation from the mods that this sounds fucking pog before I go?
[12:46.23]It's still a little compressed.
[12:49.03]How about... Actually, this actually sounds better.
[12:51.59]Oh, yeah.
[12:51.83]I think I got it.
[12:53.09]Bingo.
[12:53.50]Got it right now.
[12:54.08]This is it.
[12:54.50]This is the one.
[12:56.18]This is absolutely the one right here.
[12:58.90]Yep.
[12:59.78]It sure is.
[13:02.12]Alright.
[13:02.32]Let me turn it up.
[13:04.60]There we go.
[13:05.26]Guys, I got it.
[13:05.80]I think I got... This is the one.
[13:06.77]This is the one right here.
[13:07.61]This is the one.
[13:09.57]This is the one.
[13:10.03]Nobody move.
[13:10.63]I got it.
[13:10.91]This is the one.
[13:15.27]Yep.
[13:15.59]I got it.
[13:15.93]This is good.
[13:17.73]Let's fucking go.
[13:18.43]I'm ready.
[13:21.93]Audio is so fucking hard to work with, it really is.
[13:25.09]Like, fuck audio, you know what I mean?
[13:28.52]You know, the worst thing I ever did was, like, get, like, a fucking real microphone.
[13:31.78]I should just have a thing taped to my mouth the whole- who cares?
[13:34.40]You guys ready?
[13:38.40]Let's go.
[13:42.77]The biggest mistake you can ever make as a streamer is like, oh, I gotta have like a professional microphone, and I've gotta have a setup where it goes into a compressor, and then it goes from the compressor into the computer, and then I go into my audio settings and change the equalizer.
[13:52.93]No, just give me a tape fucking microphone in my mouth, and who cares?
[13:55.93]And now you can hear when I move.
[14:01.25]I fucked up.
[14:02.23]God damn it.
[14:02.79]Do I have the other profile that I had saved?
[14:04.87]Of course not.
[14:07.17]Shit.
[14:07.93]Oh, I fucked it up.
[14:09.37]I fucked it up so bad.
[14:14.72]Alright, hold on.
[14:17.41]Yep, got it.
[14:19.51]Alright, let's go!
[14:21.89]Fucking shitty audio, Andy.
[14:23.33]Whatever.
[14:24.49]What do you see?
[14:25.77]You gotta have a professional setup.
[14:30.35]Alright, let's go.
[14:35.05]How you doing?
[14:36.60]You doing good?
[14:38.22]Let's play Iron Lung.
[14:43.76]This is loud.
[14:49.12]DJ Andy.
[14:51.57]This is really fucking loud.
[14:52.91]Alright, is this game gonna scream at me?
[14:55.49]Is this a screamer?
[14:57.65]Or am I fine?
[15:01.35]Lights off.
[15:10.03]It's like 4 o'clock in the afternoon, guys.
[15:12.93]It's not gonna do anything.
[15:13.93]Maybe later.
[15:47.34]Okay.
[15:47.48]There you go.
[16:09.75]That just made a mess.
[16:10.57]No, I didn't.
[16:10.91]I'm fine.
[16:12.21]It's just soap.
[16:12.85]That's all it is.
[16:13.37]Oh, it's on my hand.
[16:19.72]Alright, so there you go.
[16:20.48]I ate a glove on stream.
[16:21.74]What was I doing?
[16:25.56]I don't even know what I was just doing.
[16:26.64]What was I just doing?
[16:27.53]What was I just doing right now?
[16:29.37]Somebody help me.
[16:33.27]Turning the lights off.
[16:33.91]Right.
[16:34.73]Okay.
[16:42.01]They're already off.
[16:42.75]The lights are already off.
[16:44.37]They're not on.
[16:49.71]The lights are already off.
[16:54.39]Are we ready?
[16:55.49]Okay.
[16:57.49]I know, stalling, stalling, stalling.
[16:59.57]My microphone sounds like stupid.
[17:02.03]I'm sorry.
[17:06.23]I thought I was fixing things and I just made it worse.
[17:08.39]Alright, you guys ready?
[17:09.03]Let's go.
[17:10.60]New game.
[17:23.64]That was huge!
[17:26.99]I'm ready, let's go.
[17:30.59]Decades ago, every known star and habitable planet vanished, leaving only those who were on space stations or starships.
[17:38.70]This event became known as the Quiet Rapture.
[17:42.40]With supplies dwindling and infrastructure crumbling, survivors are searching for any trace of natural resources in a universe of barren moons, lit by the ghost light of vanished stars.
[17:54.38]One such moon holds a strange anomaly, an ocean of blood.
[17:58.64]You are a convict, tasked with exploring this anomaly in a makeshift submarine nicknamed the Iron Lung.
[18:07.69]It was not designed for this depth, so you will be welded inside and the forward window will be closed.
[18:14.25]There was no time for training.
[18:15.33]If successful, you earn your freedom.
[18:20.03]So every planet disappeared and got destroyed.
[18:26.06]Drink the bubble mix.
[18:32.82]You're just coming up with all kinds of stupid shit, aren't you?
[18:35.84]Like, for me to do.
[18:37.98]Why would anybody do that?
[18:42.79]That's not happening.
[18:43.95]Don't do that.
[18:44.47]Why would anybody do that?
[18:48.11]Take care of your bodies.
[18:49.01]Don't drink fucking shit that can hurt you.
[18:51.77]Alright, so let me get like a... Let me get a TL;DR here.
[18:54.87]This like fucked up voice Andy is still reigning supreme here.
[19:00.03]Uh, so I'm a convict.
[19:02.11]Everybody, all life died and we like got stuck on a space station.
[19:06.47]You got it.
[19:09.03]Beginning at descent.
[19:13.18]Cruising depth in roughly 40 seconds.
[19:14.96]Standby.
[19:21.48]I'm seeing some voltage irregularities in the instruments, so keep an eye out for Sparks or flames or anything like that.
[19:28.99]I've got a better mic than I do.
[19:31.55]Approaching maximum depth.
[19:33.91]The hull's feeling it, but it's still holding strong.
[19:39.07]Closing porthole shielding.
[19:47.33]Roger, can you repeat that please?
[19:49.41]View ASD as move, interact, tabs, and map.
[19:51.00]Whoa.
[19:51.30]Briefing.
[20:13.82]Two weeks ago, we conducted an exploration of Moon 85 for the first time since the Quiet Rapture, leading to the discovery of a fourth blood ocean.
[20:22.07]The trench beneath the ocean's surface has several points of interest.
[20:26.47]Your task is to photograph these points of interest with the SM-13's forward camera.
[20:32.03]Photos must be taken within two units of the specified position and 10 degrees of the specified angle.
[20:37.37]You can also use the camera to help with navigation.
[20:39.97]Only photos taken at the specified points of interest will be saved.
[20:43.63]Since you can't navigate by sight, pay attention to your coordinates and consult the map.
[20:48.49]Proximity indicators next to the sub controls will trigger if you're getting close to an obstacle.
[20:55.31]Okay.
[20:58.62]Hepe laughed.
[20:59.10]This guy wanted to ban geometry in classrooms.
[21:09.02]Am I gonna need some help?
[21:11.44]Ahem.
[21:17.19]Alright, so I have to go take pictures of this stuff.
[21:18.99]And I have this forward-facing camera.
[21:27.55]Okay.
[21:29.03]What does this do?
[21:32.98]Alright.
[21:36.12]Can I open the... How do I take... Can I look through something?
[21:41.38]Alright, so this is... What was it?
[21:45.16]Okay.
[21:45.62]Points of interest.
[21:50.44]Okay, so... X325, Y741.
[21:58.75]X325.
[22:05.25]Dude, I actually, like, can't see because it's too bright in this room.
[22:08.19]I should have played this, like, in two hours.
[22:10.25]I'm playing this game at the absolute worst possible time because the sun is, like... It's, like, four o'clock in the afternoon where the sun is, like, at its fucking apex.
[22:20.21]Okay, that's a... There's so much glare on my screen.
[22:23.16]What was that?
[22:32.48]How do I change X?
[22:33.00]Alright, what was it?
[22:35.54]It was... I'll go here first.
[22:37.65]X 180... Y 576.
[22:58.22]Can I look out the window?
[23:05.91]I'm in a submarine.
[23:06.87]Yeah.
[23:17.69]Do I know where I... Okay.
[23:18.89]Hover over... Y5... A184.
[23:20.96]Where's A?
[23:21.34]Is this A?
[23:35.38]Oh, no, I'm going south.
[23:40.42]Okay.
[23:41.64]How do I change X?
[23:44.96]I'm in a submarine.
[23:45.87]Yeah.
[23:48.53]Yeah, I know, but how do I, like...
[23:53.73]Oh, shit.
[23:54.95]This is not an expedition.
[23:56.05]It's... It's an execution.
[23:59.07]When they put you in here, they don't want you to return.
[24:01.21]And even if you do... And even if they keep their promises, what freedom waits for you?
[24:06.41]A few dying ships in a sea of...
[24:10.15]Dead stars?
[24:10.85]How do I take a picture?
[24:11.39]Okay.
[24:36.50]Oh, these are the buttons over here.
[24:37.82]What's this?
[24:38.80]Ooh, this is the... Okay, this is where I am.
[24:41.74]I just took this picture, right?
[24:47.68]We've got an anomaly!
[24:52.03]How do I move?
[25:02.37]Oh!
[25:02.55]Okay, I get it.
[25:05.87]Alright, so now, what's like close to me right here?
[25:09.97]I need Y, I need something, X in like the hundreds, right?
[25:13.49]Am I close to anything?
[25:18.62]Alright, I'm gonna go for, so, okay.
[25:21.74]Help me.
[25:22.72]We're talking about an axis here, so like X, Y, right?
[25:32.21]Yes.
[25:32.69]Yeah.
[25:34.04]So, like, um, when I'm talking about the x-axis, I'm talking about, like, left and right, and then y up and down.
[25:42.18]They should fucking remove geometry from school.
[25:45.64]Teach people how to do their taxes.
[25:47.59]Not, like, what that line and that line does.
[25:51.15]Okay, so I want 180x, which is pretty much there.
[25:54.71]Let's go a little bit further back here.
[26:04.40]180.
[26:07.44]So, 180X is here.
[26:12.28]So, I don't know.
[26:12.98]Where am I in Y?
[26:14.48]178.
[26:14.56]So, I'm, like, right here.
[26:17.59]178.
[26:17.61]So, I'm, like, down here.
[26:22.53]Ooh!
[26:26.13]Okay.
[26:27.92]So, I'm, like, right here.
[26:30.10]So, if I go to the right.
[26:35.61]So I need 186, 322.
[26:36.11]Am I high?
[26:37.47]What, what?
[26:39.21]I don't get it.
[26:42.07]This is X and Y, right?
[26:43.10]Isn't this like where I am right now?
[26:46.78]Wait, what are you talking about?
[26:51.28]The numbers.
[26:52.70]This is X, right?
[26:55.36]X, 1.
[26:56.53]This is where I am right now.
[26:57.55]X, 180.
[26:58.27]Y, 178.
[26:58.35]X, 180.
[26:58.57]Y, 178.
[26:58.67]So I'm like right here.
[27:06.80]I'm, like, right here.
[27:07.52]What are you talking about?
[27:11.75]Yeah, I'm reading this correctly.
[27:16.05]I gotta stop doing that.
[27:16.85]Because people, like, I look like an asshole.
[27:22.36]How many times have I, like, done the, like, I'm, like, coming into the camera.
[27:26.16]Like, I'm going into the camera.
[27:29.26]Okay, so I just have to go this way.
[27:32.83]So let's go that way.
[27:37.58]So I need to stay at 180.
[27:38.88]So if I'm here, I need to go like this.
[27:46.12]So I need X322.
[27:52.19]And I'll adjust it.
[27:54.01]What?
[27:54.29]What?
[27:54.85]What?
[27:55.47]What?
[27:56.11]What's wrong?
[28:07.23]Is that a wall?
[28:12.67]Oh, shit.
[28:13.49]Um... So, I'm at X200?
[28:16.11]Why?
[28:18.53]Wha- So, is this- Okay, is the dark solid?
[28:22.25]This- Is this, like, solid walls?
[28:25.71]This- This dark area?
[28:29.23]No, okay.
[28:30.93]So, I just have to, like, turn.
[28:34.87]Okay, so what if I take a picture here?
[28:36.27]Is it safe to go that way?
[28:41.91]I think so.
[28:42.31]Okay, we're good.
[28:49.51]X322.
[28:49.81]Let's go.
[29:15.21]What was that?
[29:17.63]I'm not going to hit that wall.
[29:20.69]Okay, we're good.
[29:21.51]Put the curtains down.
[29:22.78]Put the curtains.
[29:44.55]X322Y186.
[29:46.36]What is A?
[29:51.14]What's A?
[29:53.58]Angle.
[29:54.90]So this is angle.
[29:56.12]Okay.
[30:08.29]Fine.
[30:08.59]Alright, almost there.
[30:09.91]X322Y186.
[30:10.03]I'm almost at 322.
[30:14.49]So I gotta start going down here.
[30:17.97]322.
[30:17.99]Almost there.
[30:23.17]Alright, 133.
[30:23.71]Angle 33?
[30:24.23]What the fuck are you talking about?
[30:27.81]322, 180. 33.
[30:47.78]I can't do the curtains!
[30:48.70]186.
[30:51.51]I'm pretty much there.
[30:53.21]I gotta change the angle.
[30:55.91]33... 22, 186.
[30:56.71]What's that?
[31:16.57]I found something.
[31:30.08]What's that thing?
[31:34.12]I gotta go down a little more, I think.
[31:35.32]322.
[31:35.86]I'm not quite there.
[31:47.94]Okay.
[31:51.83]No, no, no.
[31:52.19]Other way, other way, other way.
[31:53.49]322.
[31:53.69]I gotta go this way.
[32:03.55]322.
[32:03.77]And then I have to go up.
[32:10.35]322, 186.
[32:10.71]So I have to go up or down.
[32:13.97]I don't know.
[32:16.35]You don't have to be perfect.
[32:17.23]Oh, okay.
[32:21.16]I'm almost there.
[32:21.66]186, right?
[32:22.38]33.
[32:22.52]It's a rock!
[32:51.24]So I just go forward?
[32:58.97]Oh, I got it.
[32:59.71]That was it?
[33:02.29]Oh, shit.
[33:02.81]Alright.
[33:03.85]That was good.
[33:09.99]So we're gonna go from here to here.
[33:11.19]So I got the picture, right?
[33:14.52]Do I have to print this?
[33:16.12]Or does this count?
[33:17.22]Like, do I have to print this out?
[33:23.33]No, okay, alright, counts.
[33:24.77]Alright, so now I'm gonna go 378, 263.
[33:29.07]I think I can just do this.
[33:32.29]Wait, am I gonna crash into the rocks?
[33:35.98]Oh my god, okay.
[33:37.24]I need to turn.
[33:42.42]Just move out of the way.
[33:46.90]Okay.
[33:47.16]378, 263.
[34:16.04]Nothing.
[34:16.34]378263.
[34:17.68]Game saved.
[34:18.12]That means something happened.
[34:20.30]I'm almost there.
[34:21.18]Alright, let's go up a little higher.
[34:42.95]263.
[34:42.97]Alright, alright, alright.
[34:44.97]263.
[34:44.99]Let's go more to the right here.
[34:46.95]378.
[34:47.07]Okay.
[34:47.35]Angle 50.
[35:12.78]So what's here?
[35:13.22]Kind of another rock formation?
[35:27.28]Yeah, okay.
[35:28.12]Anything here I need to see?
[35:29.14]Make sure I get a closer look.
[35:31.47]There's like a slug there.
[35:43.85]Okay, I got it.
[35:46.90]So, should I... Okay, I'm thinking head up this way and wrap around and end, like, down here.
[35:55.24]Or go this way and wrap around and end here.
[36:01.90]I wonder.
[36:05.29]I think I'm gonna go up this way.
[36:08.43]This way seems like a good route.
[36:13.02]Or this, which closer?
[36:16.60]Okay, this is 259, 406.
[36:17.36]So, I gotta go up.
[36:25.79]Yeah, 406.
[36:26.55]We gotta go up high.
[36:33.75]Hey, it's alright.
[36:34.33]No, I'm not near it. 406.
[36:43.77]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[36:45.39]What is it?
[36:45.91]What's wrong?
[36:52.44]Alright, it's just a brush.
[37:03.44]It's just a little bit of brush.
[37:07.70]We're good.
[37:14.26]406.
[37:14.32]I gotta be careful.
[37:17.44]I gotta change this to 259.
[37:18.72]So I gotta go... 304.
[37:19.50]So I gotta go left a little bit.
[37:20.96]Hang a left.
[37:43.95]Wait, why is that?
[37:44.39]Okay, yeah, yeah.
[37:47.60]That's a wall, dude.
[37:49.16]I mean, it was like... What?
[37:53.62]What does that mean?
[37:57.26]How do I increase oxygen?
[38:04.77]Okay, fuck.
[38:05.29]What's that?
[38:07.75]I'm not gonna... Whoa!
[38:15.95]Oh my goodness.
[38:17.23]Okay, wait, no, no, no.
[38:18.07]Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[38:32.01]Okay, can I go around?
[38:40.23]How do I get oxygen?
[38:45.50]I'm almost at the right height here.
[38:46.82]4-0- Okay, that's fine.
[38:48.48]4-0-6.
[38:50.42]So here- I'm like- Where am I?
[38:51.92]2- 3-78.
[38:53.80]So I'm here.
[38:57.58]I need to just go left now.
[38:59.78]But I have to wrap around.
[39:04.04]God damn, where am I?
[39:05.04]I'm like in a cavern.
[39:08.78]Okay.
[39:11.40]Can I go this way?
[39:19.98]Am I gonna hit this?
[39:21.58]How close do I have to be to hit something?
[39:25.76]Alright, pull it back a little.
[39:30.05]Turn your lights off.
[39:30.85]I can't.
[39:41.69]Yeah, I gotta... There's something in the way here.
[39:43.41]I gotta go all the way around it.
[39:52.93]What number I'm looking for?
[39:53.89]Looking for 259.
[39:55.39]God damn, that's far.
[39:56.80]And then I'll have to go down.
[39:59.50]Alright, and then I'm gonna wrap around and go down.
[40:10.56]This is scary.
[40:20.66]Okay, um... Should I go?
[40:24.32]I'm gonna have to go this way still.
[40:30.08]Oh, fuck!
[40:31.44]Can I make it through this?
[40:33.80]Can I make it through this?
[40:35.42]If I just like sneak through?
[40:37.25]Can I make it through that?
[40:45.13]That's a wall.
[40:46.07]Is it a wall?
[40:46.75]Like a full wall?
[40:54.98]Shit, it's a big wall.
[40:56.40]How do I get around this?
[40:58.68]Fuck.
[41:04.68]How do I approach this?
[41:13.20]It's on the map?
[41:13.96]Use the map.
[41:14.64]But... I thought you guys said that the dark outline didn't mean anything.
[41:20.41]I asked.
[41:20.97]I said, are these walls?
[41:22.07]And everyone said no.
[41:30.61]The white is the walls.
[41:32.55]Oh, I asked if this was important.
[41:34.05]I thought this was just like a, like pools or something.
[41:37.00]I'm inside of this area.
[41:39.18]Alright, I thought this was like, like an interesting looking map.
[41:42.56]Alright.
[41:43.42]I get it.
[41:43.80]Alright.
[41:44.04]But I asked, like, are these walls, is this like solid?
[41:46.60]And everyone was like, no, no, no.
[41:49.60]I asked if these were walls.
[41:52.33]It was the reverse.
[41:57.95]The pools is the ocean.
[41:59.99]How am I supposed to get here, then?
[42:02.79]Why did you guys tell me to go this way?
[42:04.24]I can't even go up here.
[42:04.96]This is blocked off.
[42:07.60]Alright, okay, alright.
[42:08.62]Let's fucking go.
[42:09.46]So, right now, a 312, 457.
[42:10.26]312, 457.
[42:10.34]I'm, like, here.
[42:11.58]Like, here.
[42:12.04]457.
[42:12.06]Alright, so I'm, like, looking at this wall right here.
[42:27.21]So if I go all the way left and pull it this way, I should be alright, right?
[42:35.08]If I go like this, this should be okay, I think.
[42:45.96]Dude, this shit got real thin.
[42:52.20]Alright, here we go.
[42:53.51]You guys confused me.
[42:54.67]Alright, I had from the very beginning,
[43:04.30]Alright, I'm close now.
[43:06.38]259, 406.
[43:10.21]So I need to kind of pull it up this way a little.
[43:38.39]What the fuck?
[43:43.21]There's something like- What the fuck is going on?
[43:53.32]What is this?
[44:22.04]What's the angle?
[44:22.62]296 What is that?
[45:01.55]What the fuck is that?
[45:19.34]Ugh!
[45:21.78]Did I not get a picture of it?
[45:22.86]406... Do I have to get closer?
[45:42.80]Oh, angle.
[45:43.34]259.
[45:43.36]Okay, but it's 259.
[45:45.82]Angle 296.
[45:47.96]Oh, fuck.
[45:49.16]I'm mixing them up.
[45:49.79]I have to go this way, though.
[46:12.24]backwards.
[46:13.20]Navigation is like, I don't fucking do it.
[46:14.72]I can't plot land and shit.
[46:17.68]Give me a fucking dodge roll and I'll beat it up again.
[46:23.85]259.
[46:28.55]Alright, this is close enough.
[46:30.11]So now I need 296.
[46:53.18]Alright, so what is that?
[46:56.30]Oh, shit.
[46:57.14]I have to navigate out of here.
[46:58.16]Fuck.
[47:02.76]It's the worm.
[47:07.12]Okay, so now I gotta go... If I keep going down and wrap around, I'll get there.
[47:15.63]Can I get up here this way?
[47:18.75]I wonder if I can go up there.
[47:22.97]Or should I try just go... I have to go this way.
[47:26.96]Maybe I can.
[47:29.70]I'll try.
[47:30.06]Because I'm like right here.
[47:39.77]Is there like a disconnection on the map?
[47:50.45]No, I can't.
[47:51.05]Alright.
[47:51.55]I can't.
[47:51.89]Alright.
[47:52.15]Alright.
[47:52.41]So I'm going to turn around and go down.
[47:53.47]Because I'm like right here.
[48:03.96]I'm just going to go straight down.
[48:13.17]Use the third dimension.
[48:17.00]That sounds like something they said in, like, 1995.
[48:20.30]Or, like, 1996.
[48:22.30]Or, like, a character.
[48:24.36]So, like, you use the third dimension!
[48:26.46]And it's like, oh, they turn into, like, 3D, like Homer Simpson did.
[48:35.85]Okay, so I'm at 256, 377.
[48:36.49]I'm 370.
[48:36.79]I'm, like, here.
[48:37.35]So I gotta pull it to the right a little.
[48:50.00]Head this way.
[48:55.81]I know, I know.
[48:56.47]I'm like right on the edge here.
[48:57.61]Alright, 280, 338.
[49:01.23]280, 338.
[49:01.29]I'm like right here.
[49:21.18]So I gotta keep going down to the right?
[49:26.56]Ah!
[49:27.24]I'm fine.
[49:27.76]Okay.
[49:51.88]Nothing!
[49:53.40]Are you real?
[49:59.40]A CG character can't do that, okay?
[50:01.70]We're not at CG technology where like they can do this and it looks like that.
[50:07.32]CG doesn't look like that.
[50:09.00]See?
[50:09.98]Like skin, they don't have technology to do skin yet.
[50:14.28]No, they don't.
[50:14.70]Like hair?
[50:16.40]No, that's real hair.
[50:17.48]CG hair looks fucking ridiculous.
[50:20.36]All CG hair looks like the person's underwater moving around.
[50:24.16]Sorry, I'm real.
[50:24.90]Look at this.
[50:27.48]CG can't do that yet.
[50:42.00]This guy's jiggle physics are insane.
[50:48.55]You can't be real, you don't understand basic geometry.
[50:52.21]I don't know how many times I have to say this, but... When you, okay, when you're in your 30s, I would like for you guys to remember what you did in high school.
[51:03.15]I have not, okay, when you're out of high school, you're out of college, you've been out of a classroom for like fucking 15 years.
[51:11.19]There is no, there is no thing that I am ever doing in my life that needs me to plot X and Y, ever.
[51:19.64]For any fucking reason.
[51:21.40]Ever.
[51:22.94]It's not like, oh, hey, man, what are you doing today?
[51:24.54]Well, you know, I'm just plotting X, Y, and angles.
[51:27.94]No, I'm cooking.
[51:29.33]I'm doing my taxes.
[51:31.35]I'm doing fucking chores.
[51:33.83]I'm sleeping on the couch.
[51:34.65]You know what I mean?
[51:36.74]There's no reason why I would ever do this.
[51:40.60]It's been like 20 years.
[51:45.79]And I tell you, your hard drive starts to fill in other shit and like... Geometry 2 is... You keep moving and it gets lost and the hard drive writes over it.
[51:57.37]When you're 30 fucking 5 you... Whoa.
[52:00.99]When you are 35, you tell me how you do.
[52:03.11]Yeah, I can plot the fucking right angle of a fucking acute triangle.
[52:07.35]No, you won't.
[52:15.65]No, you got more important shit to worry about.
[52:18.50]Like, you know.
[52:22.48]Like how long the grass is outside.
[52:31.02]And like, is there a hummingbird that you saw?
[52:36.63]And what's the early bird special at the breakfast place?
[52:41.59]When I go to the early bird special at the breakfast place, the waiter or waitress doesn't come over and give me a worksheet and say, hey, can you solve for X?
[52:48.42]No, they go, here you go, sir.
[52:49.46]Here are your two sunny side up eggs.
[52:58.50]Okay, where am I?
[52:58.98]363, 284.
[52:59.02]363, 284.
[52:59.84]I'm like here.
[53:00.42]363.
[53:00.44]Alright, I gotta go up a little.
[53:02.84]Okay.
[53:03.24]Ooh, easy.
[53:03.96]Where am I?
[53:04.50]376, 292.
[53:04.54]376, 292.
[53:30.56]Alright, I'm like right here, so I gotta go up a little more.
[53:41.75]I'm not gonna hit this, right?
[53:52.46]Okay.
[53:52.74]386, 314. 386...
[53:57.01]314.
[53:57.15]Okay.
[53:59.32]I think I can just go up a little and then right.
[54:08.24]A lot of people's jobs involve geometry.
[54:11.53]Okay.
[54:14.19]Fine.
[54:16.13]So, do the geometry job.
[54:28.31]Are you mad at me?
[54:29.76]What just happened?
[54:31.94]What's going on?
[54:32.38]How do I fix this?
[54:37.34]How do I fix this?
[54:37.84]What happened?
[54:44.23]Do I have to fix that?
[54:52.03]Four... Okay, I'm through the tunnel, I think.
[54:53.97]438, 322.
[54:59.69]I'm through the tunnel.
[55:01.37]Alright, so I'm right here.
[55:02.25]So I just kind of have to go, like, right and then down.
[55:05.63]So we'll go like this.
[55:07.07]Bingo.
[55:08.57]You have to solve equations.
[55:12.14]No, no.
[55:12.90]God.
[55:16.42]So I need to hit... 560.
[55:18.90]Okay.
[55:19.18]You need to solve the math quiz.
[55:35.19]All these math problem Andys.
[55:37.95]They tell me, oh, I gotta solve a math problem.
[55:39.28]I know how to do math.
[55:41.02]Math problem Andy.
[55:42.42]I'm sorry.
[55:42.72]500, 300.
[55:42.76]Alright, I'm close.
[55:45.64]500, 562, 77.
[56:16.96]562.77.
[56:17.36]I gotta go up.
[56:19.11]Did I pass it?
[56:49.17]277.
[56:58.02]Oh, this way.
[56:58.76]Alright, I'm almost there.
[56:59.94]Let me see, what does this person say?
[57:07.56]Bitches be like, I ain't never gonna use the Pythagorean theorem and then stream for a living like you are right, but regular people, sane people use it sometimes.
[57:16.86]No, don't quit the fucking game.
[57:23.88]I didn't always stream for a living.
[57:26.28]Or even worse, I was a substitute teacher.
[57:34.82]Do I need to know the pipe bagorean theorem to do this?
[57:40.48]No, who cares?
[57:46.22]Whatever, whatever, I don't care.
[57:47.84]I win, I win, I win.
[57:52.01]Alright, 43, 560, I'm there.
[57:54.70]So I need to turn to 43.
[57:55.38]But the Pythagorean Theorem, man, like, what are you talking about?
[58:01.62]I don't need to know the Pythagorean Theorem to order from the Wendy's drive-thru.
[58:06.61]Like, who cares?
[58:12.17]Like, okay, I understand if you're like a contractor, you're like an architect or something, right?
[58:17.69]Or you're like making blueprints, or you're like doing work in 3D design.
[58:21.64]Alright.
[58:26.24]It's specific work.
[58:33.03]That's like a big fish.
[58:40.09]Did I get it?
[58:40.51]Okay, I got it.
[58:41.49]So we gotta go- Wait, I wanna see another angle of this.
[58:48.44]That was crazy.
[58:53.71]Yeah, I'm sorry, but I- I'm a clown for a living.
[58:57.49]Do you- okay, when the clown blows b- Do you understand what you're fucking- what you're asking?
[59:01.95]Who you're talking to?
[59:02.61]Do you understand who you're talking to right now?
[59:05.37]Like... Honestly?
[59:08.03]Like, if you do go to the clown show, or the magician show, and they do, like, balloon animals, you don't, like, raise your hand, and the clown's like, alright, yes, you.
[59:17.44]Um, can you, like, solve this for X?
[59:21.28]The guy's gonna be like, what do you want from me?
[59:23.82]I don't fucking do that.
[59:26.82]I fucking make balloon animals for a living.
[59:29.40]What do you want me to do?
[59:30.10]No, you're not gonna have the clown do a fucking complex math problem.
[59:40.10]Alright, so we're gonna go down here.
[59:42.54]This is open water, too.
[59:56.57]Alright, 55.
[59:57.39]Let's go there.
[60:04.00]Why is this... What if he's a math clown?
[60:06.92]You'd get booed.
[60:10.84]A math clown would get fucking booed off the stage.
[60:14.74]Are you serious?
[60:17.89]He comes on up there like, I can't... Yay!
[60:21.77]Oh, yeah, I can't... Okay.
[60:25.01]Okay.
[60:27.23]So you see the right angle here.
[60:29.19]What I want you kids to do is I want you to take out your pens and papers and I want you to write down, this is 90 here, okay?
[60:35.20]And then this is 180 times those three angles together and I want you to solve, uh, what the area is.
[60:41.66]It'd be like, kids would start crying.
[60:44.46]Kids would be fucking crying in the audience.
[60:47.24]You gonna make a bunch of kids cry?
[60:50.86]The parents would leave shitty Yelp reviews.
[60:53.99]It'd be like, we ordered a clown, and the guy did, like, math problems.
[60:56.48]And, like, it was fucking terrible.
[60:58.34]I wish I could have gotten my money back.
[60:59.82]613.
[61:03.15]What's the... 190.
[61:05.87]Okay, I'm on the right track.
[61:21.71]Alright, I'm getting there.
[61:23.89]197.
[61:30.05]That's literally a Family Guy joke.
[61:31.40]You stole that from the show.
[61:32.54]No, I... I... Guys, I don't... I didn't... I didn't... I... No, I didn't.
[61:40.78]No, I didn't.
[61:41.26]That's not even in Family Guy.
[61:43.81]That's not in Family Guy.
[61:44.97]You're a liar.
[61:45.57]Okay, 55.
[61:55.22]It's not.
[61:56.18]No, it's not.
[61:59.83]The thing is, everybody will believe you because Family Guy, like, that could be a Family Guy joke.
[62:04.43]And everyone will believe you because Family Guy's made a bunch of just, like, random references to every single thing ever.
[62:11.51]Skeleton.
[62:13.19]A ribcage or something.
[62:13.91]I need to get a little closer. 613197.
[62:40.58]Okay, is that close enough?
[62:41.66]195.
[62:42.48]Alright, 55.
[62:43.80]Is that close enough?
[62:57.83]Holy shit, it's like a dinosaur.
[62:59.48]Hold on.
[63:05.16]Holy shit.
[63:05.72]Okay, wait, a little more.
[63:11.87]Whoa.
[63:15.56]That's kind of cool.
[63:19.20]Alright.
[63:20.74]This is going to be a pain in the ass.
[63:25.84]So if I go from here, I just go that way.
[63:27.56]I don't want to crash into this, though.
[63:33.14]That's kind of cool.
[63:37.40]I even checked for scurvy.
[63:38.38]I'm kind of concerned.
[63:40.63]Guys, I drink, like, a green tea drink that has, like, vitamin C. I'm fine.
[63:44.53]Alright, let me just make sure I know where I am.
[63:52.33]640, 195.
[63:52.37]640, 195.
[63:54.75]So I'm, like, here.
[63:58.48]So from now, just go boink.
[64:00.74]And I should be fine.
[64:01.28]For a little while.
[64:17.06]I'm confused about what's happening.
[64:19.30]I am somebody that is locked in this submarine.
[64:23.53]And it's my job to go take pictures of anomalies that are on the bottom of the ocean.
[64:27.87]All life has been removed from the planet.
[64:30.95]And there's like a space station that they have created.
[64:34.82]And then people that were on space stations stayed alive, I guess.
[64:38.52]Because like everything on planets died.
[64:40.06]I don't know.
[64:40.78]It's interesting.
[64:48.95]Alright, I should slow down here.
[64:50.31]7, 10... Eggs.
[65:01.67]7, 10, 250.
[65:04.77]7, 10, 250.
[65:06.03]I'm about right here.
[65:07.21]Alright, still on the right path.
[65:09.84]Keep going.
[65:16.32]I'm gonna- This is gonna be so hard to navigate in this little hole.
[65:22.40]Okay.
[65:24.60]I think... So, 732, 270.
[65:27.35]732, 270.
[65:28.49]I'm, like, here.
[65:34.73]Alright, so this should be alright.
[65:38.97]Now I just have to weave through this.
[65:53.65]Yo.
[66:05.76]Are you scared?
[66:07.10]Yeah, it's kind of weird.
[66:13.90]Okay, seven.
[66:14.76]I gotta make sure I'm in the tunnel.
[66:16.78]Which I might not be.
[66:18.38]Two, seven, sixty, two, sixty-eight.
[66:23.88]I'm in the tunnel.
[66:25.24]I'm like right here.
[66:25.78]Yeah, alright, easy.
[67:20.62]Seven... Alright, I think I'm in.
[67:22.78]788, 271.
[67:22.82]788, 271.
[67:23.30]Alright, I'm like here.
[67:26.50]So I gotta go right and then... Yeah, okay.
[67:30.00]We're good.
[67:30.24]We made it through.
[67:34.02]What the fuck?
[67:35.20]There's a wall right there?
[67:36.04]Where am I?
[67:36.46]Huh?
[67:50.41]Eight, okay, 8275.
[67:55.39]800... 275.
[67:58.93]Where is this?
[68:09.28]Birth canal?
[68:16.83]Oh, I'm gonna be coming out of the birth canal, just wait.
[68:26.13]Okay.
[68:26.49]864, 258.
[68:27.69]Getting there.
[68:28.45]This is kind of far out of the way.
[69:32.60]8... I'm close.
[69:39.46]What is that?
[69:39.94]864... 258.
[69:39.98]864... I gotta get closer?
[69:43.45]How am I gonna get closer?
[70:10.58]864, 258.
[70:13.52]Is it this?
[70:14.06]Should I just turn the angle a little?
[70:15.27]There's like a log in the way.
[70:56.21]Am I not in the right spot?
[70:57.17]864209.
[71:02.51]864258209.
[71:02.63]I mean, this is like almost exactly where it is.
[71:29.01]Oh, I got it.
[71:29.47]That was weird.
[71:30.65]What is that?
[71:31.11]It's like a log?
[71:35.20]So I gotta get out of here and go up.
[71:37.26]Oh, this is gonna be a huge pain in the ass.
[71:41.38]Looked like a house.
[71:42.66]Yeah, it kinda did.
[71:46.67]It's like a building.
[71:47.33]Yeah, that was weird.
[71:51.57]Alright, I gotta get out of here now.
[71:59.76]You should crash.
[72:00.44]It's funny.
[72:07.10]Alright, so I'm here.
[72:07.96]I need to go, like, left.
[72:13.04]Gotta be careful I don't hit anything.
[72:16.14]This is a little tight area, too.
[72:17.62]830, 300.
[72:17.66]830, 300.
[72:18.92]830, 300.
[72:28.35]Alright, I'm like, I gotta go down left here.
[72:31.58]I'm way too high up.
[72:40.12]Easy.
[72:40.48]Alright, here it is.
[72:42.94]Alright, yeah.
[72:54.75]I think I'm in the tunnel right now.
[72:56.31]Yeah, I definitely am.
[73:00.99]What are you guys copy pasting here?
[73:02.79]What the fuck?
[73:10.34]What is this?
[73:23.02]Alright.
[74:10.11]People don't minus to me.
[74:11.57]I just read it.
[74:18.89]You didn't even comment on it.
[74:19.97]How am I supposed to comment on it?
[74:21.57]Well, that was a crazy one, man.
[74:23.49]Yeah, that's crazy.
[74:25.77]People have fucked up dreams about me.
[74:27.05]I don't know why.
[74:27.65]Okay.
[74:46.31]Worst one guy moment?
[74:47.81]No, no.
[74:48.97]We don't do worst one guy moment.
[74:51.07]We don't do worst.
[74:51.83]We only do best one guy moment.
[74:53.63]That's not how it works.
[74:54.45]Did I just hit something?
[75:04.82]What did I just have?
[75:05.28]What happened?
[75:06.96]I didn't hit.
[75:07.30]Nothing was on the radar.
[75:12.72]Alright, where am I now?
[75:13.40]560, 350.
[75:17.06]560... 350.
[75:17.12]How did I end up up here?
[75:20.30]Wait, what?
[75:21.72]563, 350.
[75:22.08]Oh, okay, right.
[75:22.44]563... 350.
[75:22.48]I'm here.
[75:22.80]Alright, so I just gotta go up.
[75:25.34]If I see a wall, be careful.
[75:55.24]Ayy, alright.
[75:56.99]Is it blood?
[75:58.13]Alright, 400.
[75:59.27]Why 400?
[75:59.97]We're about here.
[76:00.51]556.
[76:00.53]Okay, so I just need to... I'm going through here right now.
[76:06.55]So we need to go up and then right.
[76:12.34]What happened?
[76:13.48]What happened?
[76:13.98]What the fuck just happened?
[76:14.96]What?
[76:18.24]What the fuck happened?
[76:20.60]Where was I?
[76:26.02]Jesus, how did I crash?
[76:28.60]I was... What?
[76:41.79]What's going on?
[76:48.29]What the fuck's happening?
[76:51.27]I got some soft locked?
[76:55.39]How?
[76:56.07]No, I'm not.
[76:57.01]It's an auto-save that- Oh, my God.
[77:12.98]Oh, shit.
[77:17.08]Oh, come on.
[77:18.26]I was, like, halfway- I was, like, more than halfway through the game.
[77:22.78]Is there a save I can pull somewhere?
[77:24.20]Is it like an autosave thing?
[77:27.56]Is there an autosave?
[77:33.43]That, like, is in sections or something?
[77:41.83]Speedrun it.
[77:45.33]Shit.
[77:46.31]That's so sad.
[77:48.01]That's so sad.
[77:52.20]Oh my god.
[77:53.08]Let me see if I can speed run it.
[77:54.68]Fuck!
[77:55.46]That sucks.
[77:58.16]That sucks so bad.
[78:01.02]What the fuck?
[78:02.24]Okay.
[78:02.94]What happened?
[78:03.70]I'm so... I... Okay.
[78:07.82]I understand the game.
[78:08.44]I'm just gonna go fast and I'm gonna get it done.
[78:11.95]Go watch somebody's Let's Play.
[78:14.17]You can do it.
[78:24.24]See you in 20 minutes.
[78:26.02]No softlocks in Glover.
[78:27.46]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
[78:31.40]Is this a tweet?
[78:34.60]Someone tell Jerma I can tell them how to fix their save.
[78:37.44]How do I do it?
[78:38.00]How do I do it?
[78:39.06]How do I do it?
[78:39.62]That's so funny.
[78:41.54]How do I fix my save?
[78:43.99]The dev literally just tweeted this.
[78:48.23]Alright, I'm going to refresh the dev's Twitter and see if he gives me a solution.
[78:56.94]It's in the game files.
[79:03.51]It's too late.
[79:07.43]Replace the newest autosave with a previous one.
[79:11.19]Okay.
[79:12.97]Is it not too late?
[79:13.63]Did I?
[79:13.93]I didn't just do it.
[79:14.47]I didn't just fuck it up.
[79:15.03]Did I?
[79:17.79]What do you say?
[79:27.17]Hehehe, he's so silly.
[79:29.19]Quick, he's reading!
[79:29.95]He's watching your tweets, go!
[79:32.57]Oh shit, he's playing it.
[79:33.65]Thank- okay, alright.
[79:34.87]How do I do it?
[79:38.27]Jerma softlocking himself through the game halfway is probably on brand.
[79:48.79]Okay, new tweet, new tweet!
[79:49.85]What do we got?
[79:55.97]Hold on, Jerma.
[79:56.65]I'm typing a solution.
[79:57.85]Alright.
[80:04.97]He can DM a mod.
[80:06.03]Yeah, DM one of the mods.
[80:07.55]They'll help.
[80:10.07]Close the game?
[80:10.65]I'm just gonna close the game, right?
[80:13.81]Okay, closing the game.
[80:16.94]Tech support.
[80:19.94]Alright, game is closed.
[80:24.86]Okay.
[80:26.06]What do we do?
[80:27.49]What do I do?

[92:07.07]No, no, no.
[92:07.83]Z330.
[92:09.09]Oh, beg, leave me alone.
[92:10.45]I beg you, I forgot how to do math.
[92:12.73]Somebody replied and said, are you defusing a fucking bomb?
[92:22.63]People don't know what he's talking about.
[92:26.78]He just looks fucking unhinged.
[92:33.85]That's so funny.
[92:39.34]Are you diffusing a bomb?
[92:43.40]I mean... I don't know.
[92:47.96]Okay.
[92:49.28]We're in the tunnel.
[92:53.41]Jerma, how come you can't just have a normal playthrough of a game?
[92:55.83]I don't know, dude.
[92:58.65]I feel like there's been a few.
[93:00.21]Mario Sunshine was a normal playthrough.
[93:03.31]That was a normal playthrough.
[93:08.01]What happened with that one?
[93:08.81]That was fine.
[93:09.33]Okay, I think I'm through.
[93:16.88]5... 430... 573.
[93:16.94]430, 573.
[93:17.48]I think if I spit on that, it would blow a level.
[93:41.61]Almost.
[93:43.73]It looked like it.
[93:46.15]It was really glossy.
[93:47.06]It could have been.
[93:50.96]Okay.
[93:51.22]573 is 428.
[93:54.07]So I'm just going to go up.
[93:54.77]I'm right there.
[93:55.25]I'm through.
[94:09.05]Oh, geometry.
[94:09.97]I'm so fucking happy.
[94:12.13]I'm in my 30s.
[94:13.01]I haven't done it in a long... Yeah, I know, man.
[94:15.09]I know.
[94:15.85]And I... I'm telling you.
[94:18.25]I feel so good right now.
[94:21.27]I feel great.
[94:22.10]Like, I'm so happy that happened.
[94:30.26]Okay.

[94:47.58]Okay.
[94:47.70]So this thing is at 623, 520.
[94:48.56]So I gotta start pulling it this way.
[95:31.04]Alright, where am I, sir?
[95:31.87]623, 520, incoming.
[96:01.06]that.
[96:02.96]That was like I was about to do it, but I realized it was like not really called for.
[96:06.08]63.
[96:06.10]Okay.
[96:08.48]Whoa, it's another like dinosaur skeleton.
[96:25.70]It's a dinosaur skeleton.
[96:26.80]I need to back up.
[96:40.68]Turn to the left.
[96:41.48]I think I'm too close.
[96:54.92]That should be it, right?
[96:55.64]No.
[96:55.84]623, 520, 63.
[97:15.55]Alright, that's as close as it's gonna get, man.
[97:18.53]63.
[97:18.57]Alright.
[97:30.25]Got it.
[97:30.49]It's like another dinosaur bone.
[97:32.95]So how do I get up here?
[97:35.68]This way and up?
[97:36.88]This is not on the map.
[97:44.64]Like, can I go this way?
[97:45.56]It looks like maybe I could.
[97:46.38]Alright, I'm gonna go this way.
[97:50.53]So I just have to turn- I just have to turn- My mouth is, like, soapy.
[97:53.44]I'll be right back.
[97:55.30]Give me one second.
[98:38.17]Thank you.
[99:49.89]Alright, I'm back.
[99:50.73]I'm better.
[99:52.41]I'm better.
[99:57.57]Very cool.
[100:00.91]Let's go.
[100:07.94]Both headphones have to go in.
[100:08.88]I feel better.
[100:10.56]Yeah.
[100:11.88]Don't try that at home.
[100:12.48]Don't fucking do what I did.
[100:13.44]I was trying to catch a bubble on my lips and blow it back out.
[100:18.44]Didn't work.
[100:20.20]Don't do that.
[100:21.46]Unless you're a certified professional clown like me.
[100:24.80]Well, professional in, like, quotes.
[100:26.27]Like, I give myself that term, right?
[100:32.75]Alright, let's go.
[100:33.71]So, where am I?
[100:34.24]I need to go just left.
[100:53.87]I don't want to crash.
[100:57.81]He sounds kind of sad.
[100:59.05]Is he okay?
[101:04.03]Bro.
[101:05.82]I'm fine.
[101:06.52]I just ate a bunch of KFC.
[101:10.44]I'm good.
[101:11.98]That fucking extra crispy bucket.
[101:13.40]I'm telling you.
[101:22.03]He looks like a greasy butt.
[101:23.15]I don't care.
[101:23.75]Whatever.
[101:26.19]Alright, five, six.
[101:30.72]Five, six, one, five, ten.
[101:32.02]Five, sixty, one, five, ten.
[101:34.96]So, I gotta go kind of left.
[101:36.97]Like, down.
[101:37.65]Okay, let's go.
[101:51.87]Alright, what am I looking for?
[101:52.57]I'm looking for like four, like 350x.
[101:56.91]While staying at about 500.
[101:57.95]Yeah.
[102:11.21]Don't.
[102:15.97]Don't.
[102:16.27]Where even am I?
[102:18.39]What's going on here?
[102:21.61]Okay.
[102:30.47]I'm really close to a- what wall am I close to?
[102:50.38]4-30-5-14.
[102:50.60]4-30... 5-4... There's no wall here.
[102:52.41]What happened?
[102:53.31]Am I gonna die?
[103:18.26]Okay, there's bubble solution all over my keyboard and it's like I'm sliding around it.
[103:21.34]Oh well.
[103:29.05]Good thing I'm playing Glover with a controller.
[103:32.99]It's soap, it's fine.
[103:34.11]It's literally soap.
[103:35.55]I gotta clean the keyboard anyways.
[103:37.47]It's probably been a while.
[103:42.81]The dev said they're gonna patch the bug that I just saw in the next update.
[103:50.47]It's fa- it's- it's not- it's alright.
[103:55.27]Okay, three- what am I looking for?
[103:56.47]300.
[103:56.49]Or like 350, 500.
[103:57.71]Alright, keep going.
[103:58.78]Is this a wall?
[104:20.45]It's a tree, okay.
[104:24.05]Watch out for trees.
[104:30.89]What the?
[104:37.69]How do I get, what?

[105:48.17]Can I?
[105:49.03]Am I?
[105:49.27]Is this like not what I'm supposed to be doing?
[106:13.35]Oh shit.
[107:01.97]You're a beta male.
[107:02.85]Okay, well, um, correct me if I'm wrong, but, uh, beta male is a higher version than alpha male.
[107:14.94]Beta would be 0.1, alpha would be 0.01.
[107:17.98]So, do you think I fucking care?
[107:32.66]so what I get to be a like a bigger like a more like a better version a more complete version no I'm not a beta male okay yeah yeah you think that's a beta okay I don't know what drugs you're taking
[108:02.18]Just wait till I get to, yeah, wait till I get to release 1.0, man.
[108:04.72]Alright, I think I'm through.
[108:14.61]367, 619.
[108:14.69]Three, wait, 619.
[108:22.94]So I'm like right here.
[108:25.70]Let's just go up.
[108:29.48]I want Jimbro Jarva back.
[108:32.78]Uh, Jim Broderma was like ten fucking years ago.
[108:35.73]Okay?
[108:38.40]It's never coming back.
[108:55.86]Okay, so I just gotta go straight up here.
[108:59.22]This is gonna be so hard to navigate.
[109:00.82]Oh my god.
[109:03.11]So just 325, 741.
[109:03.39]325, 741.
[109:29.79]You just got unfazed by the fire.
[109:35.23]I mean, I saw the... I almost said Axtinguisher.
[109:38.74]Like, fucking the pyro.
[109:40.46]I saw the Axtinguisher over there, so I knew it was gonna probably happen eventually.
[109:44.80]What is the baseball stream, by the way?
[109:46.64]You'll find out.
[109:47.92]The baseball stream.
[109:50.31]That's it.
[109:50.57]741, 325.
[110:18.75]Okay.
[110:20.29]What's the angle?
[110:23.30]18.
[110:33.44]That's definitely gonna get removed.
[110:35.09]That's gonna get removed from the moderator.
[110:37.69]But it was fucking crazy.
[110:57.28]Oh my god, it's a big crab.
[110:59.38]That got auto-modded?
[111:00.48]I know, I know, I know, but I don't get it.
[111:04.00]It was fucking weird.
[111:06.34]It got auto-modded, alright.
[111:07.54]Whatever it was, it got auto-modded, that's all you need to know.
[111:10.51]It was, whatever.
[111:15.47]What the fuck is that?
[111:16.87]Can I get a better view?
[111:23.50]Ugh.
[111:25.43]We have to know.
[111:26.07]I have to know.
[111:26.63]What was it?
[111:27.33]Yeah, I was... Yes, in the mod chat, that's what it was.
[111:31.76]That's what it was.
[111:34.69]I don't, I'm not gonna encourage this behavior, but I'm gonna tell you something right now.
[111:38.33]Don't fucking, this is not to be encouraged, but it was just like, what the fuck, man?
[111:43.42]Uh, somebody asked what the baseball stream is.
[111:46.34]And I said, whatever.
[111:47.20]And then, like, it's been, like, five minutes.
[111:49.04]It's been, like, at least five minutes.
[111:50.56]Somebody, like, added that person, I think, and said he's gonna shove an entire baseball up his ass on stream.
