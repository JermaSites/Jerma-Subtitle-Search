[00:02.61]Alright, well, we're doing Turmoil.
[00:04.33]I want to try Turmoil.
[00:10.05]Peglin.
[00:10.41]Yep, Peglin's on the list.
[00:13.17]Turmoil looks really cool.
[00:14.39]I'm really interested.
[00:25.48]This is a game where you get oil or something.
[00:32.42]Do a wow stream?
[00:33.44]No, it's not going to happen.
[00:46.84]Okay.
[00:48.96]So.
[00:53.81]Start new campaign, right?
[01:03.31]Let me do the settings.
[01:05.16]Graphics.
[01:06.74]Good.
[01:07.48]Very good.
[01:08.32]60 FPS.
[01:10.42]Yep, yep, yep.
[01:12.12]Okay.
[01:14.10]Audio is fine.
[01:15.60]Everything seems good to go.
[01:18.66]Okay, let's start.
[01:30.05]Okay, so select... choose your character.
[01:32.11]I'm gonna play as... Joshua.
[01:39.26]Howdy, partner.
[01:40.50]This dude has been herding cattle long enough to know that nights on the prairie are cold and lonely.
[01:45.90]Hope earning money with oil is as easy as throwing a lasso.
[01:49.67]Yes.
[01:51.23]Hi there, future oil baron.
[01:52.39]Welcome to my soon-to-be lovely town.
[01:54.05]The oil industry will be booming here.
[01:56.57]Let's get to work.
[01:57.11]Click on the wagon and I'll show you the basics of oil drilling.
[02:03.53]Hop on and I'll take you to the oil site.
[02:08.15]Welcome to your first oil mining operation.
[02:09.91]Just follow my instructions and the oil will be flowing in no time.
[02:13.43]Before you can start drilling for oil, you have to know where to drill.
[02:16.07]Hire a dowser to take care of this.
[02:43.04]He found oil.
[02:43.68]It's time to start drilling.
[02:44.42]Select the oil rig.
[02:47.78]Oil can always be found somewhere below a dowser.
[02:50.80]So place the rig right here.
[02:54.73]He's literally hitting the head with a wrench.
[02:56.95]Drag downwards from this point and release at the other point to connect the oil.
[02:59.97]Drag downwards from this point and release at the other point.
[03:09.88]How far down should I go?
[03:16.18]Oh, okay.
[03:21.29]I know I'm going to love this game.
[03:22.47]I'm going to be obsessed.
[03:25.97]You struck oil, but where should you take it?
[03:27.95]The left ink, of course.
[03:31.37]It's like the horse wagon.
[03:32.29]Put a wagon here.
[03:34.39]I'm going to click oil and unload it at my company.
[03:36.44]Cha-ching.
[03:37.08]They wouldn't have said that back in the 1100s.
[03:50.22]This introduction ends when you brought the cash amount back up to $13.50.
[03:52.94]Okay.
[04:01.55]Got it.
[04:03.53]Back to town.
[04:04.01]Good job.
[04:05.75]Now it's time for the real work.
[04:07.29]Come to town hall and meet your rivals and get yourself a parcel of land for your next venture.
[04:11.61]Oh, no.
[04:12.07]Don't make me do it.
[04:13.80]Don't make me do the thing that won worst impression of the year last year.
[04:16.66]I want to do it.
[04:19.44]I will.
[04:27.83]Hello there.
[04:28.25]Does being a lawyer sound interesting?
[04:30.89]Well, in truth, it's kind of boring and I couldn't handle it.
[04:35.14]I've got a serious case of oil fever and the only cure is finding oil.
[04:45.43]That's what literally lost.
[04:46.79]Um, that was the worst thing I ever did last year, apparently.
[04:49.13]20 grand for what?
[05:00.44]It still is.
[05:01.02]I know.
[05:01.58]I'm just reminding you.
[05:02.82]You can't vote for that twice, though.
[05:04.18]It's important to know.
[05:18.36]Why can I barely hear this? ...
[05:31.78]He used to profit.
[05:32.78]He used to support a lot of people.
[05:35.36]He knew what was there and he found it.
[05:37.00]Prosperous little business.
[05:38.10]Three wells per dookie.
[05:39.26]Your birth.
[05:40.40]Virtuous.
[05:41.64]Pursing you, poor Eli.
[05:43.26]Not a band is sound.
[05:46.03]That land has been had.
[05:47.45]Be by you, milkshake.
[05:49.43]A mice.
[05:51.57]Have a straw.
[05:52.23]There it is.
[05:52.85]That's a straw, you see.
[05:56.42]Drink your milkshake.
[06:01.61]I drink it up!
[06:09.04]Oh my god.
[06:10.40]I just came to a really crazy realization about the way my brain works.
[06:14.42]The reason why that's the way that I do the Daniel Day Lewis I drink your milkshake routine is because I'm skipping through the fucking video.
[06:33.37]That's why I'm doing that.
[06:34.96]Like, I... What the fuck?
[06:37.34]Don't...
[07:02.83]insane it's from me skipping through the movie because I like want to maybe get to a scene or maybe I'm skipping through a certain scene that's that's really weird to think about that anyways let's play this game
[07:34.96]It's like this.
[07:37.65]Yeah, I've seen this.
[07:38.65]This is one of my favorite videos.
[07:59.77]It's not possible for me to not laugh at this video.
[08:01.61]I'll try.
[08:01.99]I'm going to try as hard as I can to not laugh at this video.
[08:05.67]It's cheating, though, because it's impossible.
[08:12.79]I genuinely think this is impossible.
[08:20.85]Let's see if I can do it.
[08:25.81]What do I get if I make it?
[08:28.16]What do I get if I make it?
[08:42.25]Oh, no.
[09:18.23]Yeah.
[09:43.91]stupid like soy pointing meme god damn it he does the like the point thing god damn it really unbelievable unbelievable I can't believe it man whatever okay I'll just I'm gonna try from here
[10:15.82]I just spit all over this.
[10:18.60]It's the microphone.
[10:19.94]Put the microphone right here.
[10:39.11]Once Macho Man shows up, it's over.
[10:40.77]Because I know he will.
[10:48.56]Macho Man's is the best, without a doubt.
[11:18.79]I think I'm good.
[11:19.79]I'm good.
[11:20.09]I'm good.
[11:20.35]I'm good.
[11:20.67]I'm good.
[11:21.05]Help them.
[11:21.61]Help them.
[11:33.48]The same guy?
[11:43.23]Oh my god dude!
[12:18.45]It's like a Banjo-Kazooie character.
[12:20.71]Like a bellows with eyes on it.
[12:23.30]You know what I mean?
[12:31.95]Is it Logan Paul?
[12:34.03]What?
[12:35.17]No, it does, does it?
[12:55.29]I'm in the back with, like, the thing.
[13:05.07]Older Logan Paul.
[13:06.61]Wow.
[13:08.07]That's insane.
[13:08.73]Alright, I gotta play the- I'm gonna play the one that- I'm gonna move on in a second, I promise.
[13:18.18]Let me get this one real quick.
[13:23.10]This one's short, I promise.
[13:42.47]Where is he?
[13:45.97]There it is.
[14:14.57]Why is there Superman in this?
[14:23.16]Oh, for a second, I thought all the, I thought Superman was going to be like, I thought they're going to do it with the Superman movie.
[14:30.46]I was like, what?
[14:31.16]I was like, no, they're not.
[14:38.33]Ready?
[14:41.99]If you can hold your breath!
[14:52.13]What the fuck is this video?
[15:22.78]Okay, I've had enough.
[15:23.98]I've had enough.
[15:24.98]I've had enough.
[15:25.72]I can't do it anymore.
[15:27.86]I wonder if somebody did that with my stream.
[15:32.69]What would that sound like?
[15:35.15]Would it be as fucked up?
[15:45.69]It would be worse.
[15:47.03]I'm trying to think of how I talk.
[15:48.44]Like... Hey, what's going on?
[15:49.90]I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.
[15:50.92]I made a nice living in real estate, but it's time for a new business plan.
[15:53.78]I'm... I do it.
[15:54.92]Now I'm going to think about that a lot.
[16:05.02]Okay.
[16:05.28]We have to play a game.
[16:08.34]Okay, so let's get to work.
[16:10.26]Uh, Buenos dias.
[16:10.88]I have sailed the world as a ship captain for years and I can't even swim.
[16:13.80]I don't... I don't want to worry about drowning anymore unless it's in money.
[16:18.25]Let me assign you to your own piece of land.
[16:20.15]The first one is on the house.
[16:21.91]Oh, is this like a risk?
[16:29.23]Okay.
[16:30.93]Today, to celebrate the opening of my brand new bank, I've opened an account for each of you.
[16:41.36]If you need to borrow extra cash or come by to view a financial report of your last venture.
[16:44.94]Okay.
[16:49.54]So this is me, right?
[16:53.80]Let's get that oil.
[16:54.62]We're taking $2,000 with us to cover the start costs.
[16:57.50]Are you ready to go?
[16:58.24]Alright, let's do it.
[17:01.66]I need dowsers.
[17:07.36]Got something?
[17:13.79]Got something?
[17:16.69]Let's go!
[17:18.41]How far down should I go?
[17:26.64]Should I go- Wait, what did I do?
[17:37.64]Did I screw this up?
[17:49.45]What just happened?
[17:50.79]How do I have no money?
[18:29.54]I had 20 grand!
[18:43.08]When did I spend 914 dollars?
[19:02.76]What?
[19:05.90]Because I have to... Okay.
[19:13.39]Wit.
[19:15.39]I found a way to increase the capacity of pipes.
[19:17.17]Highly recommend it.
[19:18.27]Okay, so I have to find that shit.
[19:22.09]Alright, no.
[19:24.74]Get out of here.
[19:25.38]I'm not going to spend seven grand right now.
[19:29.50]I'm a piece of land at the town hall.
[19:32.30]Oh yes, I was expecting you.
[19:33.10]What can I do for you?
[19:34.19]Land auction.
[19:34.83]Let's gather all the tennis together in the... to get... to auction.
[19:38.81]Okay, let's go.
[19:41.37]In turns, you decide which plot of land you get to mine next year.
[19:45.29]On your turn, click on a parcel to bid on it.
[19:46.97]You can outbid others by clicking on their parcels.
[19:50.01]The numbers on the plots that have been mined... they indicate how much oil was in that plot.
[19:58.58]Okay.
[20:02.18]So there's probably oil here and here.
[20:03.76]I'm gonna say here.
[20:06.82]I'm going here.
[20:07.28]That's it, right?
[20:14.17]Okay.
[20:18.69]Yeah, all you got no money left.
[20:22.29]I got 17k left.
[20:22.75]Wait.
[20:33.60]I feel like everybody else did that too.
[20:40.60]Alright, I understand how it works now, I think.
[20:42.50]So, to upgrade a pipe's capacity, just click on it.
[20:54.80]Price is always right, at right ink.
[20:56.46]I mean, it is more, it is better.
[21:03.27]I don't know, by one cent though, I don't really care.
[21:05.35]Alright, so where would it be?
[21:16.86]Where should I dig?
[21:19.98]Left and right Twix.
[21:22.86]You got something?
[21:50.46]Why would you make me do that for money?
[22:38.42]What do I do?
[22:38.96]How do I stop?
[22:39.88]Stop!
[22:40.30]Stop!
[22:40.54]Stop!
[22:40.76]How do I stop the thing from going?
[22:42.86]Did I not hit oil?
[22:44.22]Oh, thank God I did.
[22:45.03]Alright.
[23:05.51]Deliver.
[23:05.89]85 cents go that way.
[23:07.79]How do I do this?
[23:10.85]How do I deliver?
[23:11.93]How do I deliver to that way?
[23:12.79]How do I... Where?
[23:15.01]Click the up arrow?
[23:19.19]90 cents over there.
[23:19.67]Let's go.
[23:26.30]92 cents a gallon or whatever the hell it is.
[23:34.08]What do I do about this?
[23:36.42]What the fuck is happening, dude?
[23:38.58]I just spent all that money on like a second drill.
[23:43.39]I didn't mean to do that.
[23:44.59]Should I do it over here?
[24:12.74]Stop going that way.
[24:13.42]Stop this way.
[24:14.14]What does this swimming pool do?
[24:40.78]Okay, how can I go down branch limit reach?
[24:43.56]Can I delete this?
[24:44.30]Does that mean it's gonna explode or something?
[25:54.12]Stop, stop, stop.
[25:59.23]Everybody go this way.
[26:00.93]I got 2,500.
[26:31.43]Spoilers limited.
[26:32.19]Yeah, well, there's probably plenty over here.
[26:33.85]There's probably a shitload over here.
[26:38.27]This is filling up.
[26:54.82]That's for a year, right?
[26:56.04]I got plenty of time.
[27:06.25]um yeah yeah the one yes dude what are you talking about um what the fuck just happened
[27:38.28]They're spilling oil.
[27:39.20]Fix it by buying new wagons or by reducing the number of wagons selling oil?
[27:43.18]What do you mean reduce the number of wagons when I want more wagons?
[27:54.71]It's blown into here too.
[27:55.65]I have three things that just don't work.
[28:34.66]What does this do, then?
[28:36.50]I thought this was going to take the overflow.
[28:42.49]Oh, they take from the overflow.
[28:48.15]I thought this was going to spill into here.
[28:49.35]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[28:59.70]Fill it up, fill it up.
[29:00.36]Take all the oil.
[29:01.04]Take it all.
[29:11.29]It's $1.12 right now.
[29:11.87]Get rid of all of it.
[29:13.13]No, don't store it.
[29:14.27]Why are you storing it?
[29:16.25]Go sell it that way.
[29:18.03]Sell it.
[29:18.55]Sell the oil.
[29:19.57]Why don't you pick up the oil and sell it over here?
[29:31.80]Oh my god.
[29:36.26]I got 6k.
[29:36.82]I'm alright.
[29:39.77]$2,500 in profit.
[29:40.59]I'm alright.
[29:45.73]Paid more than this fucking moron.
[29:51.67]What the hell did she do?
[29:53.27]Okay, nice to meet you.
[30:00.38]I'm Edward and I'm a bit of a handyman.
[30:02.02]I like to experiment with stuff that can help you find oil.
[30:04.88]Make sure to check out my inventions.
[30:10.15]Yeah, of course I want the mole.
[30:13.87]I'm broke now.
[30:14.41]I have no money.
[30:14.99]I'm in trouble.
[31:01.91]Going up here.
[31:05.95]That's what I just bid on.
[31:08.94]How much is this for?
[31:10.04]3,000?
[31:10.28]Oh my god.
[31:18.98]You guys are dumb.
[31:21.76]Okay, I got five grand.
[31:27.61]You have cash to pay back, William, before your current loan becomes final.
[31:36.40]You want me to go pay the guy back $5,000 that just gave me $5,000 and be left with $142 left?
[31:39.70]How would I do that?
[31:47.12]Okay.
[31:48.56]I have a mole now.
[31:50.47]Mole.
[31:51.09]Click somewhere in the ground.
[31:52.39]The mole will uncover this spot.
[31:54.39]And then dig around to uncover five more random spots.
[31:57.56]Okay.
[31:58.36]Right here.
[32:00.18]Let's see if this is worth it.
[32:02.20]Worth it?
[32:35.80]Oh, hi, yeah.
[32:37.46]Yeah, sure.
[32:40.76]Okay.
[32:41.90]Very important that I get this right.
[32:44.88]I'm gonna say right here.
[32:50.44]Right here.
[33:00.49]Perfect.
[33:01.49]Perfect!
[33:02.37]Perfect!
[33:06.80]Increase the fucking width on this thing, please.
[33:19.83]Extend, extend it.
[33:21.33]How?
[33:21.59]I don't know how to do that.
[33:24.57]Open it?
[33:26.80]What do I do?
[33:30.28]The mole got eaten by an alligator or something.
[33:32.86]He's not doing anything anymore.
[33:33.84]What happened?
[33:35.62]Why is the mole gone?
[33:36.36]Is the mole dead?
[33:37.22]Hold the end of it.
[33:42.62]Oh, shit.
[33:43.52]Okay.
[33:45.39]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh!
[33:59.06]I have no money.
[34:19.94]Oh, I get it.
[34:20.52]Okay.
[34:20.72]Come on, dig something!
[34:37.23]Shit!
[34:40.71]Have one horse never sell.
[34:48.60]Why?
[35:05.12]So it just stores.
[35:05.92]Shit, really?
[35:08.28]Oh, I see what you mean.
[35:18.24]So it just goes like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[35:21.96]Where is the oil in this map?
[35:24.72]How much did I pay for this?
[35:57.00]Uh-oh, this is almost gone.
[36:08.89]What happens if this bullet fills up?
[36:10.03]Does this overflow?
[36:13.94]It probably doesn't, right?
[36:33.08]Why did you do that many horses?
[36:34.14]Because they're not going to be... I need to sell this oil.
[36:40.12]And they are not doing it fast enough.
[36:43.69]Okay, this is done, right?
[36:44.73]So now what?
[36:45.19]Just close this out?
[36:48.69]Or is that it?
[36:49.81]Should I dowse?
[37:04.88]I gotta get more horses.
[37:06.10]I'm not gonna be able to sell all of this.
[37:07.38]I need to go deeper, deeper, deeper.
[37:22.36]Okay, that's right here.
[37:33.82]Yeah, I found it before you did.
[37:35.32]Why even use that person?
[37:42.86]Can you fire horses?
[37:44.30]Can I get rid of people?
[38:12.94]Alright, now we're going to get started loading oil up like crazy.
[38:25.43]I need more.
[38:25.99]I want more.
[38:26.59]I need more.
[38:43.94]Alright, we need somebody to store some oil.
[38:49.06]Let's store it.
[38:50.94]And then... Oh shit, I can do double?
[38:55.73]Has this guy not found oil yet?
[38:57.51]This guy's been walking around for 10 minutes straight.
[39:05.20]Oh, final month.
[39:05.96]Okay.
[39:11.22]Sell all, sell all.
[39:12.62]How?
[39:14.16]Can I sell the horses?
[39:51.02]Okay, I'm going to pay the loan off immediately.
[39:52.53]It's too late to change to the left side.
[39:55.61]Oh, right side, I mean.
[39:58.35]Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell!
[39:59.81]Sell it!
[40:07.59]Bullshit.
[40:08.15]There's a lot of oil here.
[40:09.39]It was literally two or three patches.
[40:12.27]What?
[40:15.66]Did I pay it off?
[40:19.73]$15,000 in earnings.
[40:20.39]I spent $5,000, banked at $6,000.
[40:22.07]I didn't pay the bank yet.
[40:27.39]I didn't pay the bank yet.
[40:28.33]Hello there.
[40:33.73]I'm Rainer, the trainer.
[40:34.89]I take care of the horses to keep them healthy and ready for work.
[40:37.17]Drop by my stables.
[40:38.02]Maybe we can help each other.
[40:42.20]Blowing.
[40:43.76]Did I... Wait.
[40:48.26]I paid it back already?
[40:50.52]Why would it cover my debt right away?
[40:51.90]What if I didn't want to do that right away?
[40:53.16]Keep track of how many horses you have with this handy horse counter.
[41:03.34]Is it worth $5,000 to know that I have six horses?
[41:08.87]Okay, here we go.
[41:09.55]Depth.
[41:11.65]Dowsers can surge deeper.
[41:15.50]They find oil faster.
[41:19.47]Size.
[41:22.43]Oh, I like that.
[41:23.09]I don't have enough money, though.
[41:24.59]I don't have enough.
[41:38.33]Okay, let's go.
[41:38.95]I'm going up.
[41:40.87]Up top here.
[41:54.15]Alright, now let's... I'm ready.
[41:56.94]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[42:04.82]Let's get some profit here.
[42:05.88]No more loans, no more bullshit.
[42:11.03]Go find me some oil so I can get started right away in January.
[42:15.21]And get the silo down too, immediately.
[42:16.85]Right in the middle.
[42:18.33]Go, I'm ready.
[42:20.81]You know what?
[42:21.09]Put a mold
[42:29.36]Make it snappy.
[42:35.35]Ooh, mole found oil.
[42:36.61]Look at that.
[42:46.18]I'm putting one here.
[42:51.88]I gotta hit... I gotta strike something here.
[42:55.38]Thank God.
[42:55.96]Alright, we're good.
[42:56.42]Wait, wait, wait.
[42:56.86]Put it down a little bit more.
[43:06.57]Alright, I'm ready to rock and roll.
[43:08.53]Why do I keep saying that?
[43:11.37]I've said that like five times.
[43:19.32]I'm gonna get the guaranteed one here.
[43:27.93]Oh, shit.
[43:29.15]Oh, shit.
[43:29.89]Oh, shit.
[43:30.53]Oh, shit.
[43:31.13]Oh, shit.
[43:31.71]Oh, shit.
[43:32.65]Oh, shit.
[43:33.71]Oh, shit.
[43:34.23]Come on.
[43:34.61]Come on.
[43:34.91]Come on.
[43:35.19]Come on.
[43:35.43]Come on.
[43:35.91]Come on.
[43:36.27]Give me 150.
[43:36.73]Come on.
[43:36.91]Come on.
[43:37.21]Come on.
[43:37.51]150.
[43:37.53]Dude, come on.
[43:47.11]Just suck it up already.
[43:48.99]Nobody... Just deposit it for now.
[44:03.61]Alright, we're going left because I need- I have to go left.
[44:06.10]I don't care if I lose out on money.
[44:09.26]It's the fastest way to sell so I can get some more horses.
[44:19.49]Holy shit, this thing is flowing.
[44:21.35]Look at how much this is just flowing.
[44:33.37]Alright, I think we're in good shape.
[44:34.73]I'm gonna have two people sell.
[44:37.51]Now we can start to really flow some money.
[44:39.04]Here we go.
[44:45.72]I'm getting the guaranteed one over here.
[44:55.73]Expensive, but it should be alright.
[45:13.87]Beautiful.
[45:14.43]Nice job, Mole.
[45:16.61]Nice job, Mole.
[45:37.92]Raking the dough.
[45:45.70]Nice!
[45:47.52]Good find.
[45:48.36]Good find!
[45:50.81]Alright, start selling it.
[46:04.91]I'm gonna start to see a huge amount of flow here now.
[46:10.51]This is gonna get wacky.
[46:12.07]I need more horses.
[46:17.01]Prices are pretty much the same.
[46:19.01]We'll do half and half.
[46:22.57]Prices are pretty close.
[46:23.25]Shit.
[46:23.35]Yes!
[46:58.65]Alright.
[46:59.19]Stop selling.
[46:59.87]Stop selling.
[47:00.61]It's dog shit prices.
[47:02.63]Stop selling.
[47:03.43]Dog shit prices.
[47:13.00]Stop selling.
[47:13.96]Prices are dog shit.
[47:19.76]Uh-oh.
[47:34.56]Jesus!
[47:35.42]Okay, hold on.
[47:36.74]Don't sell anything until it's at least a dollar!
[47:52.65]Ugh!
[48:07.47]You look green.
[48:09.87]Gremlin, that's why.
[48:12.41]Do I need more horses?
[48:19.31]They gotta start taking from the reserves, right?
[48:20.73]I need more horses, don't I?
[48:32.81]They're not, they're not, look at these, well, these tanks are full.
[48:37.90]This game is awesome.
[48:39.88]I love it.
[48:40.58]I knew I was going to get stuck.
[48:56.11]The prices are crazy right now.
[48:57.35]Come on.
[48:57.79]Final month.
[48:58.39]Everybody get over there now.
[49:00.77]No more drilling.
[49:02.01]Yeah, no more drilling.
[49:02.77]Just sell.
[49:05.11]Everybody just dump all your load over here.
[49:12.53]More horses?
[49:13.19]Put this down!
[49:22.57]Hurry up!
[49:23.72]Come on, come on, come on!
[49:42.85]Come on, hurry up.
[49:45.27]Only like 10 days.
[49:46.03]$12,836.
[49:47.47]That's how we get it done.
[50:18.49]Oh, the last 50 cents.
[50:19.66]Alright.
[50:20.06]I got $1,000 in fines.
[50:21.14]Who cares?
[50:21.56]10 grand.
[50:26.74]Did anybody... No one even came close.
[50:28.84]I should get a prize for that.
[50:30.22]Welcome to my bar.
[50:33.59]Make yourself comfortable and mingle with the crowd.
[50:35.05]They may have some interesting offers.
[50:38.65]I like this game a lot.
[50:40.91]Okay.
[50:41.21]Okay.
[50:44.67]Okay.
[50:44.95]That's not bad.
[51:13.28]I can offer you a 50% discount on those hefty spilling fines for one year.
[51:18.90]No, how much is a fine?
[51:21.94]I spilled 10 times or so, and that's not worth it.
[51:24.30]No, get out of here.
[51:27.22]All you can just... All you can fuck off.
[51:31.90]Alright.
[51:36.66]More... With three?
[51:41.20]Double, um... Capacity?
[51:45.61]I can have two.
[51:50.04]Yeah, this is it for sure.
[51:51.22]Yep.
[51:52.84]This is it.
[51:57.60]I won't have that much money left, though.
[52:00.50]I think I'm going to do size two.
[52:06.62]Size two makes sense to me.
[52:17.69]I'm going up here.
[52:22.01]Why do I get to go last every year?
[52:24.39]That doesn't seem fair.
[52:25.05]I have to go last every year?
[52:31.96]I'm not bidding more money for that.
[52:42.46]Upgrade the mole?
[52:43.82]How do I upgrade the mole?
[52:49.57]There's no mole 2, is there?
[52:50.75]I don't think there's a mole 2.
[52:54.35]Alright, let's go.
[52:58.77]I'm ready.
[52:59.91]Click the button above the silo to upgrade the storage capacity of your silo against a small cost.
[53:06.13]Okay.
[53:08.13]From now on, levels will run from January 1st to December 31st.
[53:11.90]If there's no more oil left in the ground, click on the calendar and withdraw your land lease.
[53:20.20]Oh.
[53:23.04]So if I go to the last month and there's nothing left, I get some of the money back.
[53:30.17]Alright, let's go for it.
[53:31.27]What do you want?
[53:33.39]Oh, there's a Sims fast forward button.
[53:35.07]Okay.
[53:37.35]Cool.
[53:45.32]Get this started right.
[54:01.97]Is that oil right there?
[54:02.77]I can't tell.
[54:04.39]Is that oil?
[54:07.13]That looks like the edge, right?
[54:10.26]Is that an edge?
[54:20.50]Yes.
[54:21.74]Right there.
[54:22.04]Alright.
[54:22.30]We're good.
[54:22.54]We're good.
[54:22.88]Good start.
[54:23.48]Good start.
[54:36.00]Whoa, slippage!
[54:40.52]Not slippage, spillage.
[54:49.38]Go over here.
[54:50.19]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[54:51.53]This way.
[54:59.83]Okay.
[55:26.41]No, yeah, it's expensive as shit.
[55:28.71]Bring it over here.
[55:51.84]Yeah, no shit.
[55:52.54]There's oil there.
[55:54.68]Dope.
[55:58.10]Alright, I'm going to bring it back here.
[55:59.80]Okay.
[56:01.90]Start depositing it.
[56:03.38]Or start bringing it right.
[56:04.10]Okay.
[56:18.99]How is there nothing over here?
[56:19.93]I'm thinking this game sucks.
[56:22.37]Play something else.
[56:22.99]No way, man.
[56:23.53]This is great.
[56:30.08]great oh shit alright we're good alright hear me out I'm not gonna go all the way down because I'm afraid I'm gonna go through something and screw it up
[57:00.19]No, nothing there.
[57:01.07]Is it still sucking from there?
[57:04.72]Is it still getting it from there?
[57:28.48]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[57:29.94]Store it, store it, store it.
[57:30.90]You do the big rush at the end when it's like $1.50.
[57:32.48]There's some moles down here.
[57:58.87]Alright, let's start selling a little bit.
[58:00.77]78 cents is fine.
[58:02.84]There we go.
[58:08.43]Here we go.
[58:08.81]Perfect.
[58:34.49]Alright, let's go, sell.
[58:39.79]I'm gonna be taking a ton- I'm gonna be making a lot of oil now.
[58:51.04]Sell.
[58:54.32]More horses, I need more.
[58:55.34]Alright.
[58:58.56]Let's go!
[59:01.52]It's literally a dollar two right now.
[59:03.30]Speed it up.
[59:03.96]Suck it out.
[59:04.38]Alright, I'm gonna end.
[59:15.99]I'm gonna leave after this.
[59:19.27]We just drained the whole thing.
[59:20.27]Alright, I got 22 grand.
[59:22.90]Watch this.
[59:25.28]I'm out.
[59:25.64]I'm out.
[59:26.00]I'm gonna get a refund.
[59:28.22]Upgrade the pipe.
[59:29.04]Wait, what?
[59:31.20]Wait, it's only August.
[59:32.12]September, October, November.
[59:33.08]That's not... Okay, hold on.
[59:36.51]There's no more juice on the ground, guys.
[59:40.59]Is there some?
[59:40.93]Wait, there's some here.
[59:41.47]A little bit of extra at the bottom of the thing here.
[60:08.00]I'm out.
[60:12.94]I'm out.
[60:20.69]I'm out.
[60:23.18]I'm out.
[60:35.54]I just, there was one more over here.
[60:36.76]That's fine.
[60:37.12]It's a good call.
[60:37.60]I got my, I got literally, I got my money back.
[60:39.70]Look at this.
[60:40.10]Look at that.
[60:43.56]It's literally 50% off.
[60:44.62]It was a big one.
[60:46.46]It was, it was decent medium size.
[60:48.39]It was okay.
[60:56.47]Okay.
[61:00.09]Mayor's tips.
[61:03.61]That's a big deal.
[61:07.47]$4,000 to make it so its left ink will only be always $0.91.
[61:10.66]I'm going to build everything over on the left side.
[61:17.06]Nothing's even going to go close to the right side.
[61:19.92]Ooh, that's not bad.
[61:23.92]$400 for the slippage.
[61:27.86]Why do I keep saying slippage?
[61:31.32]Does a lower interest sound interesting?
[61:32.82]Pay me some cash and I'll reduce next year's interest rates by 42%.
[61:38.33]I got 30.
[61:39.36]Jeez.
[61:39.58]I'm fine.
[61:40.80]I'm going to do this one, though.
[61:43.76]91 cents permanently on the left side.
[61:45.46]I think that's a good deal.
[61:52.10]Here's tips.
[61:52.80]Come on.
[62:03.55]Tip 1 of 20.
[62:04.13]Daphne's Deals.
[62:07.59]Okay, so that's good to know.
[62:08.23]Thanks for the tip.
[62:08.85]Okay.
[62:09.05]What?
[62:44.83]You get more money for getting all the oil, for selling all the oil, and withdrawing your land lease early.
[62:49.83]Cool.
[62:53.88]Well, thank you, Mayor.
[62:54.56]Appreciate it.
[62:59.88]Uh, what else do I want to do?
[63:02.08]Size 3.
[63:02.46]Timer 2.
[63:02.80]Wide.
[63:03.41]Rewide.
[63:15.58]Or more horses?
[63:17.42]Mole sells two, I'm begging you.
[63:28.17]Where?
[63:28.95]Mole sells two.
[63:32.03]What's the mole s... Oh.
[63:36.77]Ten grand, though.
[63:37.79]Alright, I'll do it.
[63:38.77]That's like the most money I wanted to spend in this entire time.
[63:42.89]Moles dig faster.
[63:47.02]I want horses.
[63:47.66]Why did I just... I don't have enough money.
[64:17.52]I want this one.
[64:20.81]Really?
[64:21.09]You're gonna outbid me?
[64:24.55]You piece of shit.
[64:28.35]How much is it going for?
[64:29.17]Four grand?
[64:31.58]Get out of my way.
[64:37.42]You don't even have that much money.
[64:39.80]Oh yeah, you do.
[64:40.52]Whatever, fine.
[64:41.42]Who cares?
[64:44.27]I'm going over here.
[64:53.02]Go.
[64:56.56]Bulls will now uncover nine cells instead of six.
[65:00.34]I think they're probably better than the dowsers at this point, right?
[65:02.45]Let's get four going.
[65:10.67]Who needs a dowser?
[65:13.43]Left side only.
[65:14.43]This is a huge one, too.
[65:22.99]Oh my god.
[65:31.01]What a start.
[65:32.59]What a start.
[66:00.56]Oh, yes.
[66:09.13]No.
[66:11.61]Right there.
[66:53.08]God damn it.
[66:53.76]There's not enough.
[66:54.76]Oh, this is bad.
[66:55.73]This is bad placement, but whatever.
[66:57.21]It's alright.
[67:49.00]There's no oil on this side.
[67:50.87]Alright, we're in a good spot.
[68:11.96]Beat it up.
[68:24.03]Um, excuse me.
[68:25.21]Take it.
[68:25.53]Don't take it.
[68:26.19]Go.
[68:26.60]What are you doing?
[68:27.14]Get out of here.
[68:27.84]Look at that.
[68:46.49]Look at that money coming in.
[69:23.73]Alright, I need, uh, down here.
[69:25.97]See, wait, you see something?
[69:51.66]What do you see?
[69:52.54]You see something?
[70:27.10]$1.39.
[70:27.18]Look at that.
[70:27.78]Come on.
[70:28.34]Come on.
[70:28.70]Come on.
[70:28.94]I need to make more money.
[70:29.84]$1.50 per pound or whatever it is.
[70:42.59]Come on.
[70:42.95]This is so much.
[70:46.31]Is there no more oil left in this goddamn place?
[71:00.39]I think this place is dry.
[71:01.45]I think it's dry.
[71:08.36]I think I got everything.
[71:10.66]It's dry.
[71:11.06]Let me check one, a few more places.
[71:32.01]I'm pulling up.
[71:34.23]Got it all.
[71:40.27]Thousand for a bonus early withdrawal.
[71:42.15]Thousand for all oil.
[71:43.21]Thousand for all oil sold.
[71:45.62]Bingo.
[71:49.74]Did it.
[71:55.12]Feels good.
[71:57.42]Okay.
[71:59.80]I got money to play with now.
[72:04.32]What should I do?
[72:08.48]I think it's stable, right?
[72:12.97]Yeah, so I can buy less horses.
[72:15.03]Makes sense to me.
[72:17.37]So the horses can just take more.
[72:20.89]And I want them to be faster.
[72:22.03]That's $25,000.
[72:25.59]I'm done.
[72:33.21]Left is 80.
[72:34.05]Nah, 90 cents.
[72:35.55]I don't get out of bed for anything less than 90 cents.
[72:40.88]No.
[72:43.76]Nah, sorry.
[72:45.98]No, not worth it.
[72:52.26]Okay, let's keep going.
[72:59.33]34.
[72:59.37]That's not bad.
[73:00.07]You don't have to fight all the people over here.
[73:04.40]Hmm.
[73:08.50]It looks like the trend is up here is more.
[73:14.16]Let's go higher.
[73:16.76]The higher you go, it seems like the more there is.
[73:22.18]Green on this guy is crazy.
[73:23.66]I'm green?
[73:26.65]Am I actually, like, green?
[73:27.83]Like, my skin is green?
[73:29.33]What do you mean?
[73:30.25]Is it?
[73:35.93]It shouldn't be.
[73:36.57]Alright, let's move.
[73:41.81]From now on, you can upgrade your wagons to carry more oil.
[73:47.52]You can buy it by clicking it here.
[73:49.50]Remember, this upgrade only lasts for the duration of the level.

[80:51.26]I just spent $30,000 on moles.
[80:55.48]They dig faster and they do way more.
[80:57.04]I hope this is worth it.
[80:59.37]I only have $6,000 left.
[81:03.97]Wait, anybody have anything?
[81:09.35]No, 100% discount.
[81:12.86]Loans, no.

[82:33.29]Alright, stop, stop, stop.
[82:36.35]Left side, left side, left side.

[82:56.14]This is this big.
[82:58.64]Got one here.
[83:02.91]That's a long way to go.
[83:03.87]Oh shit, there's some right here.
[83:30.22]I didn't even see it.
[83:34.61]I'll get it.
[83:34.95]I'll get it.
[83:35.21]Don't worry.
[83:37.23]Nothing on the right side at all.
[83:46.29]Wait, I can connect them?
[83:48.77]Should I not do this?
[84:06.83]I need to sell it!
[84:40.48]Hurry up!
[84:50.38]Stop that bullshit!
[84:54.76]I can't move these anymore?
[84:55.64]Oh, come the fuck on, dude.
[85:06.77]What do I do about this?
[85:09.82]This is too much money to be made on the right side.
[85:11.51]I can't store it yet.
[85:20.19]What the hell?
[85:20.81]Can I close this?
[85:25.63]Close one rig.
[85:35.74]What do I... How do I do this?
[85:48.77]You can't.
[85:50.15]I can't.
[85:50.97]I guess you can't.
[85:52.43]Oh.
[85:57.82]Really?
[85:58.08]Oh.
[86:02.90]I think I'm alright.
[86:05.38]I'm okay.
[86:07.52]Let's start storing oil.
[86:16.59]I think I'm alright.
[86:22.77]Alright, store.
[86:23.55]Store, store, store, store, store.
[86:24.95]Or go left, go left.
[86:33.82]I gotta come back up and get this.
[86:40.84]Dude, this land sucks.
[86:42.58]It's not my problem.
[86:43.60]This land is terrible.
[86:44.54]I got the worst land in the game so far.
[87:09.01]You're gonna think I'm insane, but I'm not.
[87:10.23]Alright, store it.
[87:30.54]Bottom left too, yup.
[87:35.53]This land is terrible.
[87:38.79]I'm going to have to go from here that way.
[87:42.37]It's so long, but it's going to be the same length.
[87:49.71]Do not sell.
[87:50.41]These are dog shit prices.
[87:55.25]Don't sell.
[87:55.65]These are dog shit prices.
[87:56.81]I refuse.
[88:12.59]Don't sell.
[88:12.99]We're going to do a huge sell at the end.
[88:18.67]Okay.
[88:23.09]Alright.
[88:23.29]I'm going to keep going this way.
[88:24.06]63 cents.
[88:43.44]69 cents.
[88:43.83]Hold.
[88:44.49]Everybody hold.
[88:44.91]Hold.
[88:45.07]Hold.
[88:45.21]Hold.
[88:45.33]Hold.
[88:45.49]Don't move.
[88:45.81]Don't move.
[89:02.28]Oh.
[89:02.40]84 cents.
[89:02.72]85 cents.
[89:03.54]87 cents.
[89:04.38]88 cents.
[89:06.22]89 cents.
[89:06.60]Get the horses ready.
[89:08.66]Get the horses ready.
[89:11.30]Once this goes over a dollar.
[89:13.92]I'm going in.
[89:17.28]And it's time.
[89:21.31]Not yet.
[89:21.65]Go.
[89:55.13]Okay, the run is saved.
[90:02.65]135 on the left, too.
[90:03.43]Alright, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[90:21.89]Let's go!
[90:30.20]What year is it?
[90:31.18]Stop selling.
[90:31.84]Store it.
[90:46.90]I think that might be it.
[90:48.32]Let's get another couple of... I think this is it.
[90:54.01]If you want 20 cents, I'm not doing that.
[90:59.65]I think we're dry.
[91:00.15]Let's just hold on a second.
[91:07.03]50 cents.
[91:07.54]I gotta sell.
[91:16.90]Oh, I don't care.
[91:17.54]Final month is fine.
[91:18.26]I'll make more money.
[91:19.24]Hold, hold, hold, hold.
[91:20.10]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[91:21.28]The price is climbing.
[91:22.02]Don't do that.
[91:27.79]I'll make more money.
[91:28.47]I'll make more money.
[91:51.53]Got it.
[91:52.43]Five grand, that was bad.
[91:53.85]Okay.
[91:59.80]Oh.
[92:22.66]Alright.
[92:26.10]Diamond hunting moles?
[92:30.18]That's pretty cool.
[92:31.50]I can work with that.
[92:36.22]Anthony might be in the saloon to help you out in exchange for a diamond.
[92:39.35]He'll point out an oil-rich parcel to you.
[92:44.19]Really?
[92:44.51]What do you guys think?
[92:51.50]I'm thinking right.
[92:52.38]I'm thinking all the way to the bottom right.
[92:57.28]Yeah, either top right or bottom right I think is what I'm going to do.
[92:59.34]Right in the mid?
[93:05.81]I should ask the guy.
[93:08.85]Well, I need a diamond.
[93:09.51]I don't have a diamond.
[93:13.79]I'm going right here.
[93:14.43]Let's hope it was worth it.
[93:18.56]Alright, I got some money.
[93:22.13]Moles will dig even faster.
[93:23.65]I can have a scanner.
[93:26.43]If you want to know exactly what sits where under the surface, use the scanner.
[93:29.97]That sounds really good.
[93:33.64]Diamonds?
[93:36.32]I can train moles so they dig up diamonds.
[93:41.96]That's expensive.
[93:52.25]Left will never be 81.
[93:57.17]Always over 70.
[93:58.19]That's bad.
[93:58.85]It's also bad.
[94:03.67]I thought it was 20 bucks.
[94:05.61]I was like, wait, hold on.
[94:06.39]Alright, factory.
[94:11.19]Drill.
[94:11.73]Found a new drilling method which allows you to drill through rocks.
[94:15.84]Uh-oh.
[94:20.76]That's not good.
[94:24.23]Well, I hope they find some diamonds.
[94:27.37]This is a long stream for you, Jerma.
[94:29.27]I told you we were doing gamer weekend.
[94:33.27]I don't want to leave.
[94:34.13]I'm having a great time.
[94:35.35]I'm going to stay.
[94:37.12]I'll stay for a while.
[94:39.86]That's why I started early.
[94:42.30]This game's... I love this game.
[94:43.98]Should I beat this game?
[94:44.80]Like, right now?
[94:47.06]Should I go eat food, come back, and just beat this game?
[94:53.68]Put a mole directly on it if you find a diamond.
[94:57.76]Alright.
[94:58.98]Well, get to work, guys.
[94:59.98]Mole friends.
[95:12.23]That's rock.
[95:16.48]I'm concerned about this.
[95:29.75]Because I can't drill through that.
[95:31.07]Okay, there's no... I think I'm alright.
[95:51.67]$70?
[95:52.95]Alright, let's go.
[96:01.91]Change sides.
[96:02.45]Alright, stop.
[96:12.07]Store it.
[96:14.59]Now... I'm going to go here.
[96:17.66]And here.
[96:23.28]Just slowly kind of make my way down.
[96:28.36]Double this up.
[96:29.44]Another horse.
[96:30.00]I need more horses right now.
[96:34.96]71 cents.
[96:35.22]It's alright.
[96:36.38]It's not ideal, but I'm gonna do it.
[96:38.02]I need the money.
[96:40.12]Okay, store it.
[96:42.50]I need more horses.
[96:49.04]What's the point of the game?
[96:50.17]Make a bunch of money and become an oil tycoon.
[97:10.49]Alright, start selling left side.
[97:11.99]Okay.
[97:22.82]Some more mole action.
[97:23.62]I still want to hit rock.
[97:34.95]It might break it.
[97:45.81]This is a big one right here.
[98:05.37]Oh.
[98:05.51]Alright, start storing it.
[98:10.73]Can I drill around this?
[98:13.41]How do I get around this?
[98:21.67]Or can I not?
[98:26.42]I don't... I think that goes all the way... I think I have to go right.
[98:28.28]Shit, I gotta get down here.
[98:45.35]This better not go all the way around.
[98:51.15]So much shit over here.
[98:51.93]Alright, 92 cents right side.
[98:54.89]Start selling it.
[99:06.98]Go.
[99:07.18]Whoa!
[99:09.86]Stop!
[99:10.26]Go the other way.
[99:20.80]Actually, perfect.
[99:22.06]Alright, we're good.
[99:25.60]Now I can slow down a little, because I need to get around here.
[99:30.10]Question is, where do I want to go from here?
[99:31.42]There's no rock here, right?
[99:50.27]It might not be anything else over here.
[99:58.61]I'll dig.
[99:59.13]I don't want to spend too much money digging down.
[100:00.39]There's nothing there.
[100:02.01]I could go this way.
[100:02.86]OK.
[100:24.45]I think this is stuck.
[100:40.11]Spending money to dig a hole to make money.
[100:45.06]I mean, kind of.
[100:54.03]I'm literally getting this game right now.
[100:55.93]This is addicting.
[100:58.07]It really is.
[100:58.71]It just is.
[101:04.35]It's great.
[101:07.62]Not too complicated.
[101:08.50]It's just kind of... You gotta make... There's some RNG, right?
[101:12.32]You gotta find the thing to dig into.
[101:13.98]I don't... I click...
[101:20.71]Oh, shit.
[101:23.31]Alright, I'm gonna go from... What does that mean?
[101:31.94]What does this mean, though?
[101:39.06]Wow, close and open.
[101:40.99]Is it to divert or something?
[101:45.73]I don't want to make another one just for a tiny little thing.
[101:48.06]How much is it gonna cost to get over there?
[101:49.20]278?
[101:51.04]It might cost the same amount of money.
[101:56.99]Just build one.
[102:14.69]Caught it on the way down, but it's alright.
[102:17.59]Left side.
[102:37.71]Branch from second node on the middle well.
[102:39.37]I don't have... I didn't upgrade that.
[102:50.15]This might actually be it.
[103:00.86]That was it.
[103:03.78]Fuck.
[103:05.68]That was a terrible plot.
[103:11.19]That was such a bad plot with rocks all over the place.
[103:14.07]Who picked that?
[103:20.08]Okay, that is the worst plot in the entire game.
[103:24.56]In the entire two hours I've been playing this.
[103:28.35]24.
[103:29.51]Even the tutorial zone had more.
[103:46.40]77 cents.
[103:48.04]No.
[103:50.18]No.
[103:54.66]Save for the drill?
[103:55.42]Yeah.
[104:03.89]I don't even use the dowsers.
[104:05.69]They're too slow.
[104:11.43]Alright, yeah.
[104:11.91]I can't spend any money.
[104:13.05]That was a bad one.
[104:15.31]Alright, where?
[104:15.81]What do you think?
[104:17.35]I don't want you to see my yellow stained armpits.
[104:21.97]So I'm going to move over this way.
[104:27.52]I still work out in this shirt.
[104:28.86]I hope anyone is figuring that out.
[104:31.64]Top left.
[104:33.16]Top left.
[104:44.43]Good.
[104:45.01]We all picked one.
[104:45.81]Okay, hopefully mine was right.
[104:47.32]This could be huge.
[104:50.00]This could change the rest of the course of the entire game.
[104:57.79]I gotta play efficiently.
[105:17.21]Not bad.
[105:36.79]Stupid!
[105:37.21]You're an idiot!
[105:38.23]Why did I do that?
[105:49.63]Sell right.
[105:58.33]Sell right.
[105:58.91]Keep going.
[105:59.64]Keep selling right.
[106:00.22]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[106:06.90]Left side.
[106:11.98]Alright.
[106:13.70]It's still pretty good.
[106:14.52]Let's start putting this together.
[106:20.76]I hope there's no rocks here.
[106:21.68]That would be bad.
[106:22.14]Alright.
[106:35.89]It's going to start flowing pretty hard now.
[106:45.21]Oh my goodness.
[106:46.09]I need some more horses right now.
[107:01.93]Not prepared.
[107:02.77]I wasn't prepared.
[107:03.61]I'm not getting a fee every time this happens, right?
[107:10.33]Why are you storing it?
[107:12.47]Oh my God.
[107:13.75]What a disaster.
[107:14.75]Okay.
[107:25.76]What a disaster.
[107:43.68]There we go.
[107:44.28]This is huge.
[107:45.08]I'm going this way.
[107:45.66]This is a monumentally huge one.
[108:20.88]Oh, shit.
[108:21.66]Okay, there's more.
[108:40.43]Connect these two.
[108:41.19]Alright, this is looking pretty good.
[108:43.47]Found some money over this side, on the left side.
[108:49.80]Some mole action.
[109:01.78]Still over a dollar.
[109:02.72]A dollar seven still over on left side.
[109:04.18]Okay, that's better.
[109:16.80]I wonder if I should... Okay, there we go.
[109:18.58]Right here.
[109:18.82]Alright, I'm going to stop selling here.
[109:37.33]Alright, stop selling.
[109:39.57]You go to the right side.
[109:40.29]There's more over this way.
[109:47.30]I might connect these two together.
[109:48.42]Start selling right side.
[110:11.69]All back on the right side.
[110:13.75]After this batch.
[110:14.33]Alright.
[110:16.75]Back to depositing.
[110:17.45]We're going to wait till it's over a dollar and then we're going to go for it.
[110:19.85]We're going to go super mode.
[110:32.39]Oops.
[110:39.09]Alright.
[110:49.55]Start selling.
[110:50.21]Uh-oh.
[110:50.54]Uh-oh.
[111:07.89]What are you going to do?

[111:49.13]Oil patch far left.
[111:49.91]I got it.
[111:50.57]Going for it.
[111:57.15]I'm okay with 84 cents.
[111:58.23]That's good.
[112:02.97]September.
[112:03.43]Is there anything down here?
[112:06.90]If there's something down there, then you know what I mean.
[112:16.20]We've got to be careful.
[112:20.95]No, this is it.
[112:21.73]It's just this here, and then I've got to wrap back around and get this.
[112:27.70]Alright, start storing it.
[112:28.38]Store it.
[112:30.64]This one's almost drained completely.
[112:37.07]I'm going... I know I'm an idiot, but whatever.
[112:39.65]I need it.
[112:40.31]I want the thousand dollar bonus.
[112:50.92]Shit, there's one below it too.
[112:53.48]Oh, come on.
[112:54.26]Really?
[112:54.54]Really?
[113:15.69]There's nothing else over here.
[113:16.49]$700 to get a bonus of a thousand.
[113:52.67]I think that's it.
[113:58.36]This looks like shit, but whatever.
[114:00.68]Alright, get it.
[114:03.36]Hurry up.
[114:06.45]Suck it up, suck it up, suck it up, suck it up.

[114:11.05]Oh, did I get it?
[114:32.71]What should I do?
[114:34.33]The rock drill is really important, yeah.
[114:39.19]Where's that factory?
[114:39.93]30,000.
[114:42.55]You found a new drill method which allows you to drill through rock.
[114:47.29]Yes.
[114:48.79]And that's all I'm going to do for now.
[114:51.35]Anything cheap?
[114:56.73]Sure, I'll get it just to get it.
[114:57.79]Why not?
[114:58.11]Okay, I can go through rock now.
[115:03.97]Oh, the branch.
[115:05.03]Oh, right.
[115:07.71]Okay, remind me to do that next time because I can't just not do that.
[115:14.35]That one was really good.
[115:15.85]It was like 40 grand.
[115:18.15]I'm staying up here.
[115:18.87]Probably right here, right?
[115:21.67]This is 48, 54.
[115:23.25]This has to be at least like 50.
[115:26.03]Or probably up here.
[115:26.75]All the way to the top.
[115:30.29]Let's try this one.
[115:34.32]Outbid, huh?
[115:35.90]Fine, I'll just outbid you.
[115:39.68]Really?
[115:40.54]Fine, I'll just outbid you.
[115:45.60]Stop!
[115:50.29]Who has more money?
[115:57.95]I'm not going higher than 6k.
[116:03.51]What are you guys doing?
[116:06.55]What are you doing?
[116:17.90]He scammed me!
[116:18.83]He did it on purpose!
[116:19.67]Okay, what did I just do?
[116:21.65]10,000?
[116:25.13]Okay, I'm in trouble.
[116:26.27]Because it cost...
[116:29.82]2,000.
[116:30.14]No, I'm alright.
[116:31.87]And I got the drill, too.
[116:32.75]Alright, we're good.
[116:33.33]We're good.
[116:33.59]I just gotta get... These moles gotta do work right now.
[116:36.91]Put them strategically.
[116:40.77]Okay.
[116:41.29]Let the moles do their thing.
[116:48.53]Good job.
[116:49.81]Nice work.

[117:15.22]Start right here.
[117:20.54]Right there.
[117:21.02]A couple of horses.
[117:23.50]I'm going to do... I'm going to sell on the one and one.
[117:32.34]Don't upgrade this shit yet until I can handle it.
[117:34.98]I do this every single time.
[117:35.96]Okay.
[117:58.87]Start storing it.
[118:00.78]I'm now prepared to upgrade these.
[118:02.21]I'm gonna go with a second drill here.
[118:30.92]No, it didn't spill.
[118:31.92]That's such horseshit.
[118:32.74]I'm gonna go this way.
[119:22.22]I was scared that I wasn't going to make it through this.
[119:24.72]I thought there was going to be a wall here.
[119:25.82]Alright, we're good.
[119:46.70]You don't have it?
[119:47.37]I thought you did.
[119:47.87]You do now.
[120:11.37]Alright, store.
[120:11.91]This is where we're gonna start to make tons of money.
[120:26.97]I paid 10 grand for this spot.
[120:28.41]There better be more than this.
[120:29.45]This is a joke.
[120:54.77]What's happening?
[121:01.04]I was too lasered in.
[121:04.12]I was lasered in to just that spot right there.
[121:09.34]And I wasn't paying attention.
[121:10.20]I'm in trouble.
[121:10.74]This is bad.
[121:11.44]So quick!
[121:30.69]Everything's fine.
[121:51.31]What a trash fucking place to do this in.
[121:54.18]What a garbage place.
[121:56.52]I paid $10,000 for the amount of oil that would fit in a Capri Sun.
[122:03.37]Are you kidding me?
[122:22.05]See anything over there?
[122:28.11]We're at a standstill.
[122:29.03]I think I got everything.
[122:30.92]Wait.
[122:31.16]There's no oil to get anymore.
[122:39.95]There's no more oil.
[122:44.09]I paid $10,000 for this place.
[122:52.44]Look at this.
[122:53.78]There's one snot rocket down here.
[122:56.08]Great.
[122:56.30]This guy hasn't found shit.
[123:14.19]Unleash the moles?
[123:26.55]Alright, unleash the moles, I guess.
[123:29.61]You got something?

[123:58.86]Uh-oh.
[124:03.86]November.
[124:09.04]What happened over here?

[124:27.19]Let's see.
[124:28.97]I think I got everything.
[124:32.95]That was not worth $10,000.
[124:35.41]It was empty over here.

[124:59.89]45, I guess it was okay.
[125:02.55]Not worth 10,000.

[133:15.74]Unless there's something over here.
[133:16.74]No, that's it.

[133:32.31]Everything's empty, right?
[133:34.33]Alright, let's get the thousand bucks back.

[134:30.87]I don't really use them.
[134:33.29]We could do moles.
[134:34.87]Faster moles for the scanner.
[134:38.53]Thicker pipes.
[134:39.41]Yeah, that's probably the best to play.
[134:42.19]With three, size three.
[134:44.27]With three, yeah.
[134:47.61]We can really just drain it.
[134:49.57]Alright.
[134:50.55]With three.
[134:56.17]Yeah, that was pretty bad.
[134:57.63]That's where I just was.

[135:20.70]I'm at 35, 28.
[135:24.97]42.
[135:25.05]The adjacent ones are going to be terrible.
[135:27.50]I'm just going to go right down here.
[135:32.56]Yeah, they're going to... I knew it.
[135:33.70]I knew that's what was going to happen.
[135:37.04]I'm not getting involved.
[135:46.83]Oh, they're upgrading stuff.
[135:48.05]I get it.
[135:48.39]Okay.
[135:49.75]Alright, let's go.
[135:55.25]You can upgrade pipes twice.
[135:56.21]Alright, moles.
[135:59.87]I like the moles more than the dowsing people.
[136:06.07]Alright, don't go overboard.
[136:07.27]I'm going overboard so bad.
[136:08.81]Stop.
[136:09.09]Okay.
[136:18.57]Start.
[136:21.71]And here's my plan.
[136:31.22]Is this stupid?
[136:35.02]Is this stupid?
[136:35.58]Because then I'm gonna go bang, bang.
[136:42.67]Is that stupid?
[136:56.05]What's happening?
[136:56.83]I fucked up bad.
[137:00.26]I don't have a fucking horse.
[137:07.33]Did I lose?
[137:08.39]Is the game over?
[137:11.49]Oh.
[137:12.65]Okay.
[137:13.13]I'll take a $500 loan.
[137:14.11]Thank you.
[137:17.56]I thought I actually just lost the game.
[137:56.98]This is dumb what I'm doing, isn't it?
[138:00.90]Maybe not.
[138:20.39]Oh, there's so much money on that left side and right side.
[138:32.00]Alright, thank God.
[138:35.49]Okay, back in the game.
[138:36.67]Let's go.
[138:40.15]Something right there.
[138:45.24]No diamonds, though, weirdly enough.
[139:02.49]Pay the loan?
[139:07.41]How do I pay the loan?
[139:08.21]Total debt, 700.
[139:09.01]How do I pay the loan?
[139:12.43]Can I pay it from here?
[139:22.30]I don't think I can do it from... You pay it at the end, yeah.
[139:24.36]It's alright.
[139:25.98]It's not gonna be too bad.
[139:34.44]Alright, this is level three.
[139:43.46]I need to.
[139:43.96]OK, is there any more oil?
[139:50.87]This one's a lot, so OK, this is going to be overflowing soon.
[139:59.45]I knew it.
[139:59.89]I'm trying to get in front of it.
[140:00.63]OK, we're good.
[140:02.39]Don't sell anything.
[140:03.19]These are terrible prices.
[140:07.61]Alright, I'm going to go... Right here.
[140:16.79]Got something?
[140:17.35]Oh, of course you do.
[140:18.23]Why am I hiring that guy?
[140:21.75]I'm going to be in trouble.
[140:22.80]These prices are bad.
[140:31.86]Look at this.
[140:32.76]What's with this price?
[140:33.84]Huh?
[140:37.46]Just close it?
[140:38.08]30 cents?
[140:41.54]No, you can fuck off.
[140:42.66]I'm not... 30 cents.
[140:43.86]40 cents?
[140:54.48]I have to dump it.
[140:58.12]I actually have to dump this.
[140:59.14]Because it's going to start spilling.
[141:00.98]I'm going to have to pay.
[141:02.84]Make another silo.
[141:05.54]Just... I'm...
[141:12.89]Of course, of course the price literally is fine now.
[141:18.36]No, I'm not selling.
[141:19.26]Stop.
[141:19.82]Stop it.
[141:20.54]No selling.
[141:24.38]Actually, no, this is okay.
[141:25.16]That's alright.
[141:25.50]Dump, dump, dump, dump, dump.
[141:26.32]Get rid of it.
[141:26.68]Dump it all.
[141:28.97]Wait, hold on.
[141:29.45]No, no, no, no.
[141:30.01]Stop.
[141:30.25]Hold on.
[141:30.53]Don't do it yet.
[141:30.95]95 cents.
[141:33.55]It's going to be like a dollar something.
[141:41.67]Okay.
[141:42.83]Hold on.
[141:43.31]Almost time.
[141:46.12]Go.
[141:54.06]Oh, yes.
[141:57.27]Oh, yes.
[141:57.93]Look at that.
[141:58.83]Look at that one.
[141:59.79]Oh, we did it at the perfect time.
[142:01.49]Perfect timing.
[142:03.99]Let's go.
[142:11.38]I need to figure out where more oil is.
[142:13.88]Alright, hold it.
[142:23.60]I think it's time to hold it.
[142:36.39]Alright, stop.
[142:36.93]Alright, stop selling.
[142:38.86]Start storing now.
[142:40.46]I think I'm out.
[142:46.68]Check over here.
[142:47.20]That might be it.
[142:58.61]See anything?
[143:00.95]It's a lot of wagons.
[143:01.69]Yeah, I kind of freaked out.
[143:02.53]It's alright, though.
[143:03.13]You're only 150.
[143:06.40]September.
[143:07.36]Okay.
[143:07.82]At the end of October, I can start selling.
[143:14.45]76 is a good floor price now, don't you think?
[143:16.51]Yeah, that's true.
[143:17.39]That's true.
[143:26.69]I wonder how big this is.
[143:27.41]Let's find out.
[143:31.33]Oh, shit.
[143:32.35]That might be it.
[143:35.69]Do I just hold this oil until November?
[143:37.15]Because I don't think there's anything else here.
[143:39.09]I mean, I'm going to check.
[143:46.64]This is it.
[143:46.96]Let's see.
[143:54.26]That's it.
[143:54.46]There's nothing else here.
[143:55.79]22 cents over here.
[143:58.77]Yeah, there's nothing here.
[144:04.83]Okay, November.
[144:05.56]Oh, we're going to get a good price.
[144:07.14]120.
[144:07.16]125.
[144:15.76]Wait till like 150.
[144:18.32]Okay, go, go, go, go, go.
[144:23.65]It's not coming up.
[144:29.89]Alright, I'm good.
[144:33.63]That was worth it.
[144:34.25]The $1,000 I would have gotten is not a big deal.
[144:36.63]That was like 10 grand.
[144:37.61]There's nothing else here.
[144:43.41]No.
[144:46.78]Another terrible one.
[144:48.88]I keep picking the winners, don't I?
[144:53.12]That's sad.
[145:04.73]This doesn't look correct.
[145:06.45]This looks like I'm doing something wrong.
[145:10.41]This looks like a weird food budget list.
[145:14.69]Yeah, what are you getting for food?
[145:16.62]Well, you know, 80% bread.
[145:22.04]And then, like, a head of lettuce.
[145:28.90]Here's the cabbage.
[145:30.52]Here's a cabbage slice.
[145:37.01]There's like a weird food pyramid.
[145:43.65]Maybe I'm spending too much money.
[145:48.27]Can't see the cursor?
[145:49.39]That's weird.
[145:49.89]Why not?
[145:51.45]Have you guys not been able to see the cursor the whole time?
[146:01.22]What?
[146:08.82]Oh.
[146:11.14]Well, that's weird.
[146:14.84]So you were probably guessing what the hell I was doing this whole time.
[146:20.31]There's been no cursor.
[146:24.91]Okay.
[146:29.69]Um...
[146:34.57]Has there been a point it was fine?
[146:37.53]Okay.
[146:38.83]We weren't even watching, dude.
[146:48.53]Okay.
[146:49.15]I have an announcement to make.
[146:49.89]I will soon retire as mayor.
[146:51.63]My successor will be the one who has the most shares of my town, which I will gradually sell at the new stock auction.
[147:01.89]What?
[147:04.84]I'm selling my shares of the town.
[147:06.23]Let's go to the auction and see who takes a step closer to becoming the new mayor.
[147:15.87]Press the start button to start the auction.
[147:17.19]The first one to press the buy button acquires 2% of the town's shares.
[147:20.25]What do they cost?
[147:21.13]Is it $36,000?
[147:23.18]How much money do I have?
[147:35.07]Okay, I have 32,000.
[147:39.77]Is it 36 grand?
[147:58.83]I own this fucking town.
[148:00.02]Let's go.
[148:04.62]Did I pay too much?
[148:05.48]Did I just pay way too much?
[148:11.22]That was for only 2% of the shares?
[148:20.24]That doesn't sound like a good idea now that I think about it.
[148:25.77]I could have waited till like less than 5k probably.
[148:28.25]Oh well.
[148:32.43]Imagine getting 2% of the shares and you think you own the town.
[148:39.86]Well, I can't upgrade anything.
[148:40.92]Turned out that was really dumb.
[148:47.55]Do I do it again?
[148:48.09]No.
[148:48.15]Okay.
[148:49.21]The town is evaluated at $800,000.
[148:52.85]So I actually just didn't really do anything.
[149:04.43]I'm going to hold on to the money.
[149:12.47]Again, look at this trash.
[149:16.93]Junk, junk, junk.
[149:18.05]I need something that's not junk.
[149:21.04]These are all bad, though.
[149:22.30]I'm just going to go over here.
[149:27.12]Somebody said near the water.
[149:34.52]Hope you're right.
[149:35.00]Okay.
[149:46.99]Write ink.
[149:48.33]It'll never go under a dollar.
[149:56.19]That's ridiculous.
[149:57.29]I have to do it.
[149:59.95]Okay, so I gotta be ready to sell because it's never going under a buck.
[150:07.13]Let's do it.
[150:09.19]Okay.
[150:09.79]Let's go.
[150:10.13]Hurry up.
[150:11.39]Write ink.
[150:12.81]I hope it's all on the right side.
[150:17.91]Get a dowser out there too.
[150:18.99]We gotta go now.
[150:23.37]Got something?
[150:23.81]Good.
[150:24.15]Alright.
[150:24.69]Let's start.
[150:53.89]Go, go, go.
[150:54.39]Let's go.
[150:55.03]Sell, sell.
[150:55.71]Just do... I'm never gonna... I'm not gonna even buy a storage unit.
[150:58.95]Why would I?
[151:00.23]Just sell permanently.
[151:01.15]Always sell.
[151:11.41]Where's this guy seeing this oil?
[151:32.79]Move!
[151:34.55]Guys!
[151:35.01]Uh...
[152:11.26]Oh boy.
[152:14.28]Oh boy.
[152:15.26]Go and buy it and sell it on the market over there.
[152:18.52]Oh shit.
[152:30.61]Oh no.
[152:31.11]Okay.
[152:38.65]What?
[152:38.95]I freaked out.
[152:48.45]I've not seen a single diamond, by the way.
[153:05.37]This one was junk, too.
[153:24.83]This one was junk too.
[153:25.65]Great, I got a dollar.
[153:53.61]You got anything for me here?
[153:58.96]You do got something.
[153:59.98]Finally!
[154:00.50]My God!
[154:03.13]What is going on here?
[154:46.50]Thank you.
[154:46.84]I never would have seen that.
[154:52.31]What do I get?
[154:52.71]A diamond?
[154:56.03]Got it.
[154:56.93]You picked up a diamond.
[154:57.91]If you're ever short on time, use this button to play a little bit longer.
[155:01.03]Exchange for a diamond.
[155:06.16]Okay.
[155:06.62]Well, no.
[155:07.08]I don't want to do that.
[155:26.00]What a dumb... Really?
[155:42.06]Ooh, the facecam?
[155:45.87]Where?
[155:51.43]Can't really go anywhere.
[155:52.27]No, it blocks too much.
[156:01.98]Left of... Wait.
[156:04.34]I guess I could go up here.
[156:10.98]Like... Here?
[156:14.52]Then you guys can't see me selling stuff.
[156:17.89]I just don't think I fit anywhere.
[156:19.61]Maybe here?
[156:20.01]I don't fit anywhere.
[156:28.25]No, I don't fit anywhere.
[156:29.17]It's too bad.
[156:31.19]I don't really fit anywhere.
[156:36.51]Put myself right in the middle?
[156:37.85]I could do, like, here.
[156:41.71]Next to the prices on the right.
[156:46.18]I could just... I mean, that's weird.
[156:54.58]This is strange, though.
[156:57.18]No, I don't fit anywhere.
[157:01.82]I'm just going to stay down here.
[157:05.22]I shrunk that a little bit.
[157:13.21]Not enough oil here.
[157:13.99]I got absolutely just ruined.
[157:19.27]I think it's actually probably empty.
[157:27.02]They're all just crowding this one thing.
[157:29.42]Nice, a dollar.
[157:30.62]Fantastic.
[157:36.73]We're in September.
[157:38.01]I think it's empty.
[157:39.07]There ain't nothing here.
[157:51.94]Dowser's not finding anything.
[157:53.02]Did he find anything?
[157:53.70]15k.
[158:06.93]I spent five grand to make it so I could sell this shit for one dollar each.
[158:12.29]I got a diamond, though.
[158:13.31]Alright, well, let's just end, though.
[158:26.88]How did you not find that?
[158:29.25]He didn't find it.
[158:29.97]Uh-oh, stock auction.
[158:59.61]Oh, what the fuck?
[159:00.89]Who got it?
[159:01.49]I clicked it and closed the menu.
[159:06.08]1%, yeah.
[159:11.20]I got 2%.
[159:13.29]Pound for pound, I spent less than you did.
[159:29.10]Um, I kind of want the scanner.
[159:38.51]No, this is important.
[159:39.75]This is important.
[159:43.03]These things just get in the way.
[159:43.95]I'm buying it.
[159:48.43]What do I do with the diamond again?
[159:56.99]I can give this to somebody, right?
[160:01.40]Diamonds.
[160:03.48]Your diamonds are worth $25.41 a piece.
[160:05.80]Sell me one?
[160:06.58]Get out of here.
[160:07.92]Kidding me?
[160:08.28]It's a solid... It's a solid diamond.
[160:10.38]It's worth like $50,000.
[160:10.90]Get out of here.
[160:18.21]Looking for a piece of land with lots of oil?
[160:19.85]Give me one of your shiny diamonds and I'll point it out.
[160:21.91]Is this guy a liar?
[160:23.15]I also don't have... I'm not doing this yet.
[160:34.12]I don't have enough money.
[160:35.98]Yeah, I'm not going to do that because if I do that right now, I only have 7K to work with.
[160:41.51]I need 2K.
[160:43.01]So I only have 5K to work with if somebody wants to outbid me.
[160:45.51]Does Mary have any more tips?
[160:52.49]If a dowser with all the depth upgrades walks out of the screen, it means that there are no more new untapped oil pockets in the ground.
[160:59.47]Okay.
[161:01.33]Well, so that was the problem.
[161:05.66]If you're running out of silo space, don't forget you can also use your wagons to store oil.
[161:09.31]Yeah, I mean, I've been doing that.
[161:12.43]Drilling around rocks can be cheaper than spending money on the rig upgrade.
[161:15.65]Keep in mind, however, that longer pipelines are more expensive to upgrade.
[161:19.57]Yeah.
[161:20.99]Judging by the pie chart that we all looked at.
[161:25.17]Connecting pipes from an upgraded rig to pipes from a non-upgraded rig will copy... Wait a minute.
[161:35.68]We'll copy all the upgrades to the new network.
[161:41.44]Wait, hold on.
[161:44.08]So, if I just connect to this, I don't have to buy that.
[161:52.89]But you have to go a long way for that, though.
[161:55.25]Okay, going from here to here is probably like $600 or $700.
[161:58.77]How much would it be to upgrade this?
[162:00.05]$300 or $400? $300?
[162:11.41]Probably cheaper than buying the drill rig.
[162:13.17]Probably.
[162:14.09]Well, I'll keep that in mind.
[162:16.65]Cancel the scan in progress by clicking anywhere above ground or just click the right mouse button.
[162:20.75]Good to know.
[162:22.59]Actually pretty useful stuff.
[162:27.06]Okay.
[162:29.18]I should probably eat.
[162:29.68]Okay, I'm going to do one more.
[162:31.90]Here's what we're going to do.
[162:32.70]I'm going to do one more day.
[162:34.22]So I'm going to do one more day.
[162:36.92]And then I'm going to go eat and I'm coming back.
[162:43.07]I need to eat something.
[162:52.15]Well, hold on.
[162:55.41]I have a question.
[162:57.72]Question.
[163:00.16]Would you rather... Let's do a poll.
[163:04.34]Would you rather me just to keep streaming...
[163:11.05]all the way for like at least another couple of hours at least another like two or three hours let's say like let's say at least 10 hours 10 to 12 hours or would you rather we stop now and pick it up tomorrow afternoon and go again like would you rather have like a 12 hour stream tonight or would you rather have like two six to eight hour streams two days in a row
[163:42.02]What do you think?
[163:44.16]I mean, this is Omega Weekend.
[163:46.41]So... Should we do 12 hours tonight?
[163:50.41]And then I won't be live tomorrow.
[163:53.77]Because that would mean I probably would go until like 2 plus o'clock in the morning.
[163:58.57]And I definitely would... If I were to stream tomorrow, it would be like in the afternoon.
[164:05.54]What do you think?
[164:17.81]do tomorrow okay okay I'm gonna I want to play this more though don't burn out I won't burn out I'll be alright um I want to play this
[164:51.61]okay alright so here's what we're gonna do it looks like it's pretty much uh it's decided I am going to do one more day here so I'm gonna do another another day and then we're gonna start with this tomorrow how much longer is the desert oh but what if I want to go what if we just go man
[165:22.88]You know what I mean?
[165:23.38]What if we just go?
[165:24.40]And, like, fuck it.
[165:25.00]Who cares?
[165:25.38]Let's just, like, go for, like, 15 hours or something.
[165:34.20]Is that crazy?
[165:34.88]Should I not do that?
[165:35.76]Okay.
[165:37.17]Hey.
[165:38.53]Hey.
[165:38.75]Hey.
[165:40.19]Hey, you over there.
[165:40.81]Guess what?
[165:49.33]Should I go?
[165:50.31]I want to keep playing though, but I don't want to... It's been like almost nine hours.
[165:57.06]It is Omega Weekend.
[166:03.86]I'm staying.
[166:05.28]I'm not going anywhere.
[166:06.64]I'm staying.
[166:07.80]I'm going to go eat some food.
[166:08.96]I'm coming back.
[166:10.19]This may be... I'm just going to make a decision.
[166:12.51]This could be.
[166:14.59]This is Omega Weekend.
[166:17.69]Can we stop on Omega?
[166:18.93]Did I?
[166:19.25]Oh, it's Omega weekend.
[166:20.25]I'm going to stop.
[166:21.35]You stop on Omega gaming weekend?
[166:23.51]I don't think so.
[166:26.18]I'm going to keep playing this.
[166:27.24]I'm going to keep going.
[166:28.36]Because I still want to play this.
[166:29.50]I'm still really into this.
[166:30.28]I think I'm having a great time.
[166:32.24]So like, oh, I'm going to leave.
[166:33.76]And all I'm going to be doing when I'm sitting there eating is just going, I want to play that fucking oil game.
[166:39.65]Right now.
[166:39.95]I'll be right back.
[166:44.21]I'll be right back.
[166:45.77]I'm gonna eat a little bit of food.
[166:47.79]Get some water, stretch a little bit.
[166:50.07]And I'm coming back.
[166:50.57]We're gonna at least finish the desert.
[166:51.59]We're gonna finish the desert at least.
[166:59.78]You should refund those points.
[167:03.26]Oh, yeah, turn off the channel points to re-vote again.
[167:06.12]Yeah, because people are spending their channel points.
[167:14.27]Alright, here we go.
[167:15.47]Let's plan this out.
[167:16.55]I'm going to at least beat the desert tonight.
[167:19.01]Can somebody tell me what my longest stream ever was?
[167:21.75]What was it?
[167:23.05]What was the longest stream ever?
[167:24.07]You thought I was fucking around when I said I'll make a weekend.
[167:26.79]I just want to prove this to you guys.
[167:28.31]What's the longest stream I've ever done?
[167:30.30]Was it 12 hours?
[167:39.62]We're beating that record tonight.
[167:41.44]I'll be right back.
[167:42.24]I'm going to eat and stretch.
[167:43.02]This is going to be the longest stream I've ever done.
[167:45.50]I can already feel it.
[167:46.22]I'm telling you right now.
[167:47.00]This is going to be the longest stream I've ever done.
[167:49.53]Stamp it.
[167:49.87]I'll be right back.
[167:54.29]Is it going to be... I want the exact time that Lord of the Rings was because I'm beating that shit tonight.
[168:01.29]That will be... Wait, hold on.
[168:01.99]Wait, wait, wait.
[168:04.14]9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[168:07.09]That would be 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2.
[168:10.07]Oh, we can fucking do this.
[168:12.93]We can do this.
[168:13.97]I'm going for it.
[168:16.64]I feel great, by the way.
[168:17.92]It's not like I feel okay.
[168:18.92]I'll be right back.
[168:52.65]Thank you.
[170:41.55]Thank you.
[172:30.50]Thank you.
[174:19.38]Thank you.
[176:08.29]you
[177:57.19]Thank you.
[179:46.11]Thank you.
[181:35.45]you
[184:44.71]So, I didn't eat yet.
[184:49.79]I'm having food as being put in the oven.
[184:55.65]I did jog in a circle.
[184:58.77]I peed.
[184:59.69]I refilled my tea here.
[185:03.33]Got a bunch of water.
[185:06.86]Uh, I literally, I did zoomies.
[185:08.32]I did the thing the dogs do.
[185:10.12]I literally ran in a circle.
[185:11.86]I'm kind of out of breath.
[185:14.20]Because if you're gonna sit down, right, for like 15 hours or like 14 hours or something, you gotta... You've gotta get up and move.
[185:22.02]Eventually.
[185:26.50]Just microwave your food.
[185:29.18]Well, no, it's... Okay, Holly is making French bread pizzas.
[185:35.18]So...
[185:36.97]I don't want to put the French bread pizza in the microwave.
[185:40.02]I'd rather be in the toaster or the oven or something.
[185:45.38]Alright.
[185:45.76]Yeah, there's other stuff too, but I think that's the fastest thing to make.
[185:51.14]So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[185:58.09]Okay.
[186:01.27]I've ran in a circle for like five minutes, and I may have tired myself out for the stream.
[186:06.77]Wow, that was a mistake.
[186:07.69]Why did I think that was a good idea?
[186:09.87]Oh, yeah, dude.
[186:10.54]I've been, like, uh, I've been streaming for, like, nine hours.
[186:13.34]Oh, yeah.
[186:13.84]Let me get up and run in a circle for five minutes.
[186:17.54]I'm kidding.
[186:18.26]Don't worry.
[186:18.72]I'm just kidding.
[186:20.96]Okay, so, oh, yes.
[186:22.66]Okay.
[186:23.97]I got, if there's ever a time that I'm gonna break that, like, what, 12 hours, 13 hours, it's gonna be right now.
[186:31.39]There ain't no fucking way I ain't gonna do it.
[186:34.82]Unless I shit my pants.
[186:36.18]Which I would just stay here.
[186:37.24]I wouldn't leave.
[186:37.97]And I wouldn't tell you.
[186:38.49]Alright.
[186:41.69]Are you still streaming tomorrow?
[186:42.93]That is a great question.
[186:44.19]If I cross 14 plus hours.
[186:46.65]And it's like 3 o'clock in the morning.
[186:48.11]Pacific.
[186:48.61]I'm going to say probably not on Saturday.
[186:54.69]We'll see.
[186:55.17]Okay.
[187:13.90]Played Diablo II.
[187:14.78]It's my birthday.
[187:16.88]You lied about Omega Weekend.
[187:19.36]Hold on here.
[187:20.38]Hold on here.
[187:21.76]Wait just a second.
[187:23.66]Before everybody gets a little annoyed with me.
[187:27.85]Omega Weekend.
[187:29.35]Omega Weekend.
[187:30.31]I'm about to break the longest stream I've ever done.
[187:34.17]Ever.
[187:35.09]I think that's Omega Weekend.
[187:36.35]That's Omega Friday.
[187:38.65]That's an Omega stream.
[187:40.05]That's Omega Weekend.
[187:45.84]We'll see.
[187:46.50]If I might get up tomorrow, I'll be fine.
[187:52.28]Omega Friday equals Omega Weekend.
[187:54.17]Well, hold on.
[187:56.07]I'm technically... I will be technically streaming on Saturday for like three or four hours.
[188:00.65]Excuse me?
[188:04.43]Omega Friday?
[188:11.32]Omega... Omega Weekday.
[188:21.05]But hold on.
[188:22.21]Let's go over this really quickly.
[188:24.17]We're going to chill.
[188:24.93]This is going to be a chill.
[188:25.67]It's getting late, and I don't want to be loud and screaming at people and stuff.
[188:28.39]But I don't know.
[188:29.05]We might play something else in a little bit.
[188:33.38]A typical stream that I do, forget that it's Omega weekend, is what?
[188:38.66]Between 5 and 7 hours?
[188:41.50]7 and 7 is 14.
[188:42.14]That's like streaming 7 hours on Friday, 7 hours on Saturday.
[188:48.10]And then an extra epilogue stream on Sunday to like just smoke a bowl and hang out.
[188:53.80]It's not happening, by the way.
[188:56.74]Semantics.
[189:05.75]Alright, let's play.
[189:06.39]Let's play.
[189:07.29]I'm having a lot of fun.
[189:08.33]This game is fucking awesome.
[189:09.19]Did this game come out this year?
[189:11.09]Did this game come out in 2022?
[189:12.11]Because it's like this is one of my favorite games that came out.
[189:17.56]This is great.
[189:18.18]I love this.
[189:19.16]Came out last year?
[189:20.08]Oh, shit.
[189:20.56]Well, whatever.
[189:20.92]Alright.
[189:21.28]I'm gonna go over here.
[189:26.74]The... Pretty slim at the moment.
[189:29.93]Pretty slim.
[189:31.21]I'm gonna stay here.
[189:35.81]It was early access in 2016.
[189:36.87]Really?
[189:37.05]Damn.
[189:37.17]Okay.
[189:37.33]Damn.
[189:57.49]Jeez.
[189:58.11]Okay.
[190:01.33]Okay, let's go.
[190:07.14]What are your thoughts on In-N-Out raising their double-double price?
[190:15.40]Well, you're eating at In-N-Out.
[190:16.26]That was the first mistake.
[190:32.46]Okay.
[190:33.00]Can upgrade silos twice?
[190:34.18]How do you go?
[190:36.96]Okay.
[190:37.50]For the audio levels?
[190:38.36]I mean, we're getting to the later hours, right?
[190:43.38]Should we have, like, not the loud, like, you know, the music, the sounds in the background.
[190:49.75]What do you guys think?
[190:50.27]How do you guys feel?
[190:51.43]We should probably lower the lights here, too.
[190:53.95]Don't you think?
[190:56.63]Is it okay?
[190:57.81]These, uh, kind of sounds.
[190:59.17]You okay with these?
[191:06.66]Candles?
[191:07.62]Candles?
[191:11.62]Turn it down a little.
[191:12.72]Okay, yeah.
[191:13.32]I think that's okay.
[191:14.75]That should be good right there.
[191:16.81]Get the nice music, the ambient sounds.
[191:18.61]I think that'd be alright.
[191:20.71]Yeah, let me turn the lights off.
[191:22.52]Come on.
[191:36.89]How's that?
[191:37.21]Is that better?
[191:38.35]Although I'm kind of like low FPS, aren't I?
[191:48.91]It's okay.
[191:49.49]It's doing automatic gain adjustment.
[191:52.89]So the lower I... That's annoying.
[192:00.44]Hold on.
[192:11.82]Is that comfy or is that scary?
[192:23.13]It's too scary?
[192:29.97]Well, fuck.
[192:36.43]Never mind.
[192:41.57]I tried.
[192:44.29]I tried.
[192:44.99]I tried.
[192:56.34]Oh, well.
[192:57.02]What are you doing?
[193:02.69]That looks okay.
[193:03.21]That's okay.
[193:03.81]That's fine.
[193:08.35]Here's a little weird, though.
[193:15.06]Wait, I think I know what I can do.
[193:16.48]Oh, I can do this.
[193:20.62]Ugh.
[193:34.04]No.
[193:37.80]This one is called Hearth.
[193:41.34]No, this looks like shit.
[193:56.12]Is that better?
[193:56.54]A little darker?
[193:58.38]That looks... That's comfier.
[194:07.02]Yeah, that's much comfier.
[194:08.56]That feels better.
[194:17.17]My face is, like, flickering.
[194:20.95]This camera is so bad.
[194:24.06]I haven't said what this camera is, because, I mean, why, I don't really care that much, but, like, this thing sucks.
[194:30.09]It genuinely sucks.
[194:31.79]It sucks.
[194:32.41]It's because it's too cropped.
[194:43.16]I don't really want to say what camera this is.
[194:46.94]But it sucks.
[194:55.14]I know I'm stalling really bad.
[195:01.14]I know.
[195:04.15]Fine.
[195:04.41]What if I do this?
[195:07.53]Is it still flickering?
[195:10.33]Why is it flickering?
[195:17.98]I don't get this.
[195:28.24]There's tons of flicker.
[195:29.30]This gain sucks.
[195:30.32]Stop cropping it and do the zoom instead.
[195:32.00]What do you mean?
[195:37.29]Zoom?
[195:41.81]Do two cameras.
[195:46.90]Oh, fuck.
[195:47.88]Hold on.
[195:48.96]Don't make me do this.
[195:50.84]That's so dumb.
[195:53.34]No, it's too late for this.
[195:54.62]It's too late for this.
[195:55.44]I'm just gonna go.
[195:57.65]It's far too late for this.
[196:03.32]Let me turn this, this will help.
[196:09.76]There, it's not, there, there, it's not flickering anymore.
[196:12.52]Is it better?
[196:15.76]I don't see the flicker anymore.
[196:19.23]I mean, maybe a little.
[196:27.76]Let's go.
[196:32.32]Resume game.
[196:34.42]Alright, so let's do it.
[196:35.24]So this is the new, uh, new year.
[196:38.95]What did I just upgrade?
[196:39.73]I just upgraded something, didn't I?
[196:44.19]Welcome to the, uh, cozy string.
[196:49.19]I need two.
[196:54.52]I got some of that right here already.
[197:00.64]I'm going to go this way and then maybe that way too.
[197:03.06]Let's get a mole over there just to make sure.
[197:12.55]Looks like everything is on the right side.
[197:24.61]I spent $1,000 on moles.
[197:26.27]I know, but it's alright.
[197:28.89]um should I I'm gonna it's gonna overflow isn't it alright we're good okay so now let's build one here and I'm gonna do the connect thing right
[197:58.41]If I go like this... And then I eventually connect these two.
[198:06.58]Cell left.
[198:07.30]I can't go... Cell left.
[198:08.66]95, 98.
[198:08.74]We're good.
[198:09.28]I'm gonna do silo right here.
[198:18.94]That makes sense to me.
[198:21.27]There we go.
[198:21.61]Cell right.
[198:22.61]Cell right.
[198:23.33]Cell right.
[198:27.16]Sell right.
[198:27.62]Okay, I need more.
[198:30.51]It's time to upgrade.
[198:31.21]This is where it gets scary.
[198:34.13]I'm gonna have at least five horses.
[198:37.73]Be prepared to sell right.
[198:42.85]There's so much here.
[198:43.74]Alright, so now... I'm gonna keep moving this over here.
[198:48.22]We're gonna double drain this, and we're gonna split this guy this way.
[198:52.68]Yes, we are.
[198:53.76]We're gonna split you this way.
[198:57.44]I'm gonna upgrade this.
[198:58.64]Is this- is that- do I want to do that?
[199:04.23]Alright, question.
[199:07.49]If I connect this to this, is this going to become one pipe or would they still be draining from here?
[199:14.15]You just said yes.
[199:28.74]Don't connect.
[199:31.58]Okay.
[199:31.74]I'm going to need some more horses in a second.
[199:39.98]Actually, no, I don't.
[199:41.86]I keep buying.
[199:42.66]I'm horse Andy over here.
[199:44.00]Seriously.
[199:44.36]Alright.
[199:52.73]Hold up.
[199:56.36]Alright, there's a lot coming out of here right now.
[199:58.54]I actually think I'm going to need more horses.
[199:59.86]So far so good.
[200:06.58]Mole action over here on the left.
[200:15.59]Don't.
[200:16.47]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[200:17.31]Let's do another one here.

[200:39.81]Hold it.
[200:45.82]I'm not... No, hold it.
[200:46.96]Seriously.
[200:48.60]This is going to go to like... This is going to come down.
[200:50.34]This is going to go to like $1.50.
[200:53.26]Alright, this one here.
[200:53.94]Bring in the money.
[201:02.53]Okay, alright, we gotta do it.
[201:03.89]Wait, I gotta sell.
[201:04.49]We gotta go.
[201:04.91]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go before it goes down.
[201:13.47]Don't spill.
[201:15.05]Okay.
[201:18.56]Right side, right side, right side.
[201:19.70]No, no, no.
[201:20.22]Hold it.
[201:25.62]Oh my god, there's no oil coming out.
[201:27.04]Oh shit.
[201:27.56]Okay, what do I do?
[201:29.46]Uh, this way.
[201:34.06]Hold that.
[201:34.64]Check this out.
[201:40.90]Connect this.
[201:42.52]This is level 3 shit.
[201:44.43]Right?
[201:47.03]So that is gonna do it?
[201:50.07]Did that work?
[201:53.05]$1.15.
[201:53.11]I'm not doing it.
[201:53.81]Did that not work?
[201:57.65]What?
[201:57.85]Oh, isn't this gonna upgrade everything to level 3?
[201:59.55]Am I... Is that not how that works?

[203:13.04]There's nothing on the left side.
[203:22.45]That might be it.
[203:25.11]I think that actually is it.
[203:26.25]September.
[203:31.20]I think that might be it.
[203:33.12]Maybe check here.
[203:36.60]What do you guys think?
[203:37.68]Left?
[203:40.94]Somewhere in the middle?

[203:48.21]Holy shit.
[203:48.63]What was that?
[203:50.09]Did I get a diamond?
[203:51.07]I got a diamond.
[203:51.87]So who found a diamond?
[203:58.67]That's probably it, though.
[204:04.88]Okay, November...
[204:08.97]Check over here.
[204:10.35]Get a couple right.
[204:11.11]Okay, that's it.

[204:19.78]Oh, this is done.
[204:22.14]This is done.
[204:22.96]That's it.
[204:23.86]Oh, shit.
[204:24.42]Doesn't matter.
[204:25.22]Well, it's okay.
[204:25.84]Top middle?
[204:31.88]I didn't even see it.
[204:32.40]Oh, really?
[204:35.91]Really?
[204:40.42]It's okay.
[204:42.42]I'll take 20 grand.
[204:46.93]He's still streaming?
[204:47.61]Yep.
[204:48.01]If you're joining us for the first time, or you're joining us back from earlier.
[204:53.67]The dude was waving you down.
[204:55.23]Yeah, but I thought he was seeing the one I was already tapped into.
[205:02.69]The longest stream I've ever done was... Does anyone know the exact number?
[205:09.68]I got two diamonds.
[205:11.87]13 hours and 4 minutes and... 13 hours, 4 minutes, 32 seconds.
[205:16.58]Uh, if you're joining us, I'm going to break that tonight.
[205:20.31]I'm going to, uh...
[205:23.04]I'm breaking that longest stream ever in seven years.
[205:28.76]I don't really do, and then people go, what, a 13-hour stream?
[205:32.88]Like, that's really, like, in the grand scheme of things, like, people do 24-hour, people do, like, 12 to 24-hour streams all the time.
[205:39.49]Not me.
[205:41.19]Not me.
[205:44.45]I don't, I never do that.
[205:47.52]Are you going to do turmoil the entire time?
[205:49.40]I'm going to assume I'm probably going to beat this in the next few hours.
[205:54.84]Maybe the next two hours or so.
[205:57.94]And then we'll move on to something else.
[206:01.16]You're going to die.
[206:02.23]I'm not going to die.
[206:11.13]Is French bread pizza a bad choice if you want to stream still?
[206:14.35]Oh yeah, there's vegetables on it.
[206:17.66]No, I'll be fine.
[206:19.50]Get the food coma.
[206:24.89]Eat a big French bread pizza and then fall asleep.
[206:28.31]No, I'm up.
[206:29.13]I'm not going to bed.
[206:29.85]Don't worry.
[206:34.44]Yeah, I don't really do this.
[206:35.62]I never do it.
[206:37.36]I'm a four to five hour Andy.
[206:40.48]I guess I don't really have to explain why, but I am.
[206:42.94]Alright.
[206:46.28]Is this worth it or no?
[206:47.36]Because all the 50s are probably gone by now.
[206:51.94]That's pretty good.
[206:56.47]I think I'm going to do this.
[206:58.17]It's never going to go below 83.
[206:59.91]Left ink.
[207:01.59]I'm doing it.
[207:01.89]25 horses.
[207:12.00]Dowser stops waving when you tap into what he found.
[207:14.78]If he's still waving, you haven't found it.
[207:16.13]That's actually a really good tip.
[207:23.35]That's a good tip.
[207:23.89]Uh-oh.
[207:28.37]I have 24 grand.
[207:51.54]It's mine.
[207:52.00]1% share.
[207:55.92]Oh, but it's okay.
[207:58.30]I have to start to make money.
[208:00.72]Okay.
[208:01.04]Land auction.
[208:03.28]Let's move.
[208:04.84]I'm going to stay right there.
[208:05.68]Right in the middle.
[208:07.20]I know.
[208:12.08]So I'm drinking a lot of water.
[208:13.74]I'm doing a, I'm drinking a bunch of super hydrators.
[208:17.33]I've got my hydration.
[208:18.23]There's a ghost in the room.
[208:24.02]Use the diamond for the good land.
[208:25.36]I don't think there's any good land left.
[208:29.44]It was all up here.
[208:30.16]It seems to be spreading thinner down here.
[208:34.85]So, I think I'm alright.
[208:43.72]Yeah, let's just go.
[208:44.44]I'm good.
[208:46.24]Hope I got a good one.
[208:50.58]Alright.
[208:52.18]Tell me to stop doing moles after I spend a thousand bucks.
[208:56.18]Okay.
[208:58.87]Thousand bucks?
[209:02.07]What do you think?
[209:02.95]Should I spend like one thousand on moles?
[209:06.09]I don't want to go too far.
[209:13.14]Jeremy, you should record the don't call the sus guy at 3am.
[209:16.54]This is your only chance.
[209:21.30]Alright, what did I buy?
[209:22.24]Hey, hold on.
[209:24.40]What side did I buy that was never going to go under 87 cents?
[209:32.59]Was it right or left?
[209:33.37]Because they're both high.
[209:37.99]Left, okay.
[209:41.03]So this worked out perfectly.
[209:41.93]Turn it up a little bit.
[209:58.25]You might be thinking, what are you doing, man?
[209:59.95]Well... Oh, okay, we got one over there.
[210:02.05]I want to be able to start making money now.
[210:04.83]Okay, let's go.
[210:12.37]Start moving.
[210:13.37]God damn it.
[210:29.53]Okay.
[210:31.77]No, I'm not doing a silo yet.
[210:50.19]I love the moles.
[210:50.83]This is so fun.
[211:02.56]Silo's going right here.
[211:04.06]Very close.
[211:09.62]Everybody's gonna be delivering to the left.
[211:11.21]Okay.
[211:15.23]Is that enough horses?
[211:17.75]Oh, look at this.
[211:19.39]This is a huge one.
[211:20.13]I gotta go two here.
[211:23.73]This is a big one.
[211:37.67]It's empty.
[211:38.52]Okay, I gotta go here.
[211:39.82]And then I'll go a little bit down this way.
[211:42.56]Need more moles?
[211:48.72]No, I don't want to do more than $1,000 in moles.
[212:06.20]It's very possible that this is it.
[212:07.46]There's probably only a couple more here.
[212:18.38]This silo turned out to be kind of not really helping.
[212:28.80]Bring a dowser out.
[212:37.24]Easy, easy with this bullshit.
[212:39.20]Easy.
[212:47.13]Some of you deliver and some of you store.
[212:49.27]Did you find something?
[212:59.98]More of you need to come over here.
[213:05.88]Got something?
[213:10.92]I need to start selling.
[213:22.60]What do you got?
[213:23.44]What do you got?
[213:25.66]There's nothing here.
[213:26.22]Sell right.
[213:34.87]Um.
[213:36.31]It's too late.
[213:41.22]It's too late.
[213:50.99]Nothing over there?
[213:56.65]Come on.
[213:57.66]Nothing?
[213:57.96]What about all the way down?
[213:59.48]There's got to be something, right?
[214:04.06]It's too late.
[214:04.84]I can't go.
[214:05.58]It's too late.
[214:05.92]I can't go right.
[214:18.95]It is too late.
[214:20.47]Is there anything left?
[214:23.91]Why do I keep getting such shitty ones?
[214:31.94]Dowser didn't find anything.
[214:34.72]I think I'm pulling out.
[214:35.42]Should I pull out?
[214:38.98]Would you pull out if you were me?
[214:46.14]Would you pull out?
[214:54.31]I'm going to just have two more, three more moles.
[214:57.45]Then I'm pulling out.
[215:12.35]I'm out.
[215:16.04]Oh, fuck off.
[215:17.38]Really?
[215:17.64]It's fine.
[215:22.87]I don't care about the shares this time.
[215:24.43]I need to start upgrading.
[215:30.20]Pizza's ready.
[215:30.70]Alright, let me go grab my french bread pizza.
[215:34.74]I'm going to eat it on stream.
[215:36.56]I'm going to be off cam maybe for a little bit.
[215:39.43]I'll be literally back in two seconds.
[215:40.93]Give me one second.
[217:04.19]I honestly don't really want to spill this or get this on anything.
[217:07.45]Make sure I have enough room.
[217:11.80]You guys want to see it?
[217:12.52]It's pretty basic.
[217:15.50]It's pretty generic.
[217:16.10]It's just the... What is it?
[217:18.94]Who makes this?
[217:21.22]Okay, hold on.
[217:22.78]Hold on a second here.
[217:25.70]Make sure I'm ready.
[217:31.87]Want to see?
[217:32.83]Oh, Pog!
[217:35.88]Actually, it looks pretty good.
[217:39.99]It's like a commercial.
[217:44.87]First bite, let me give you a review.
[217:46.81]This is what... Who makes this?
[217:49.87]Who makes this?
[217:50.84]Holly, who makes this?
[217:53.40]Who makes this?
[217:59.62]We need it closer.
[218:06.21]Red Baron?
[218:06.65]Alright, this is Red Baron peppers, pepperoni, sausage, cheese, tomato sauce, and bread pizza.
[218:17.62]Real review.
[218:18.22]It's been a long time since I've had a Red Baron French bread pizza.
[218:21.58]Let's give it a review.
[218:24.11]Here we go.
[218:24.41]I'm kind of nervous.
[218:25.79]It's too hot to bite.
[218:33.05]Give me a second.
[218:39.01]Too hot.
[218:39.23]That's how you tell if it's too hot.
[218:42.45]If I had just bit that, it would have been a bad experience.
[218:51.88]Okay, here we go.
[218:53.66]And I'm going to give you an honest review.
[219:13.91]Okay, that's good.
[219:16.15]Very good.
[219:17.32]Okay, honestly, there's a lot of peppers flavor.
[219:22.58]Big crunch.
[219:26.06]Actually, I'm getting the peppers, sausage and peppers.
[219:28.95]Let's try over here.
[219:51.21]Oh, I swallowed that way too early.
[219:52.95]Oh, fuck.
[219:54.51]Oh, I hate that.
[220:00.19]You know when you eat something, especially something crunchy, and you swallow it too early, and you just feel it just attack your entire insides?
[220:13.40]Is that a soundboard, or is that real?
[220:17.17]Is it a soundboard?
[220:19.39]Do you think that crunch is a soundboard?
[220:30.05]You think so?
[220:36.09]It's fucking delicious.
[220:42.82]It's not a soundboard.
[220:49.22]Try that again.
[221:18.10]God damn, it's good.
[221:18.84]I wonder... I mean... Yo!
[221:38.29]Minecraft dirt?
[221:44.69]Minecraft... Minecraft... Minecraft eating sound effect?
[221:56.53]Let me... Mine's better.
[222:01.81]Mine's better.
[222:23.18]That's way better.
[222:24.30]They should use that.
[222:56.65]Was it a soundboard?
[222:58.45]No.
[223:02.60]I can record, I can record myself talking and play it.
[223:09.80]I can play it back.
[223:10.82]I can play it back.
[223:12.16]That was a real crunch.
[223:13.24]That was, I recorded that.
[223:15.74]Damn.
[223:17.29]That sounds good.
[223:21.67]Really?
[223:22.15]That sounds great.
[223:25.54]Did they make commercials for Red Baron Pizza where it sounds like this?
[223:28.99]Because that actually happened.
[223:31.23]That really happened.
[223:33.30]So, like, this is not horseshit.
[223:57.93]That one wasn't good?
[223:58.79]Well, that was a lot of sauce.
[224:06.53]You're not going to get crazy crunches from the sauce.
[224:08.77]Not going to happen.
[224:16.00]Hold on.
[224:18.30]I'm going to try to get a fucking crazy one.
[224:20.14]Hold on.
[224:20.40]This is going to be crazy.
[224:21.46]This is going to be the most ridiculous crunch you've ever heard in your whole life.
[224:30.22]You ready?
[224:49.92]Somebody has to do that.
[224:51.42]I'm realizing.
[225:04.83]This would be such a fun job.
[225:10.82]Oh my god, I'm still wearing this.
[225:15.86]What a cool, like, Foley artist.
[225:17.54]That sounds like such a great time.
[225:20.35]You just get to hit bags of ice with hammers.
[225:23.71]And step on glass with boots.
[225:27.31]And bite pizzas and shit.
[225:29.17]And record it.
[225:36.94]I think I could do it pretty well.
[225:55.61]Do a Foley stream.
[226:04.45]That's actually a really fun idea.
[226:08.51]just get a blank slate of some type of video or some public domain movie or something and do fully work to it.
[226:20.64]This is, no, this is good.
[226:21.40]This is really good.
[226:22.38]I haven't had one of these in a long time.
[226:25.32]This is, I would say, pretty high up there.
[226:33.39]I should have, like, watched a video or something.
[226:34.57]What am I doing?
[226:48.40]Okay.
[226:49.47]Good.
[226:52.29]Make a bunch of free sounds.
[226:55.51]That is kind of a cool idea.
[226:58.25]Just do a four or five hour stream where you just do a ton of fucking sound effects.
[227:03.38]And make them sound good.
[227:04.30]And just release them all.
[227:06.70]Just creative, what, creative commons zero.
[227:09.00]And just anybody can use them for anything.
[227:11.72]I like that.
[227:12.08]I kind of like that.
[227:12.56]That's a fun idea.
[227:14.35]Just royalty free Andy.
[227:15.63]Yeah, just have like 5000 things that you'll never get claimed for.
[227:19.54]I don't know.
[227:32.07]Open source Andy.
[227:52.74]Too foley for Nosferatu this Halloween.
[228:04.06]Mmm.
[228:05.96]Good.
[228:24.05]License it for free for three years, then when those sounds go viral for being free, people start paying for them.
[228:30.68]We should be free.
[228:45.12]I mean, look, if you're gonna buy a signed baseball for 50 bucks from me, a lot of you guys, that stuff's not gonna be fucking... I gotta give you something, right?
[228:57.12]I gotta give you back.
[229:16.64]You guys have been getting them, right?
[229:20.75]My signature, I tried to... Okay.
[229:24.81]So way back in the day, I used to... Before I was at a convention, it was actually pretty rare for someone to come up to me and be like, Hey man, can I get a signature?
[229:33.45]I'd be like, yeah.
[229:37.33]Why?
[229:37.65]You want my signature?
[229:41.37]I just really didn't know what to do.
[229:44.08]So, a long time ago, I used to just write in just generic print, Jerma.
[229:51.55]And then I would put a, like a little swoosh under the A. And I did that for a long time.
[229:57.83]And after a while, I kind of realized, I was like, that's just the Amazon logo.
[230:03.18]I don't want to do that anymore.
[230:07.53]It was the A with the thing?
[230:09.07]No.
[230:10.38]So then, for Dollhouse, I was like, what if I did, like, a big, like, swooping J in the 985, right?
[230:15.62]I was like, okay, that's, I can do that.
[230:18.42]I can consistently do, like, a J. It's like a cursive, big, like, 985.
[230:22.83]I was like, yeah, okay.
[230:25.45]And then...
[230:27.90]I started doing them for baseball, and I realized it's really hard to draw on a baseball.
[230:34.05]And I know some of you already sent, like, pictures of, hey, dude, like, the J's wicked fucked up on this one.
[230:40.97]And I'm just like, oh, shit.
[230:46.51]And, like, the J's, like, kind of goes like this, and then out and around.
[230:51.05]So then I tried to change it a little more.
[230:53.03]I was like, okay, what if I add, like, a little tail to the J and then the 985?
[231:03.26]I don't know.
[231:03.74]I'm bad with this kind of stuff.
[231:04.70]I don't sign stuff.
[231:06.34]I really don't.
[231:08.96]That's the best part is your shitty handwriting.
[231:10.54]Something stuck.
[231:17.73]It's authentic.
[231:18.31]And then I was going to do one of them was going to be just like a crack ball.
[231:28.06]I was gonna draw just fucked up stuff all over it just like crazy shit just markings and like hieroglyphics or something and write like in all capitals huge across the ball you got the crack ball but I then one of you would have gotten it and it's not that would have been like okay who's who got the crack ball because there's only one
[232:02.16]Dude, I could have gotten a better signature at a Little League game.
[232:25.67]I don't think you could.
[232:36.92]We got robbed of the crap.
[232:38.12]No, I hope people are happy with them.
[232:39.31]I really do.
[232:40.25]Every time I sell anything, I just go like, ooh, this is suck.
[232:42.99]Do people think it's okay?
[232:43.83]I hope people think it's alright.
[232:47.95]I like doing it.
[232:48.51]It was fun.
[232:50.27]Hope you guys whoever got one.
[233:05.02]You're a scammer.
[233:08.59]You know, I will tell you.
[233:10.29]I'll tell you right now.
[233:12.67]If there was, if anybody ever really, like genuinely, like now I'm fucking around.
[233:17.25]If people were genuinely like, dude, he like, I feel like I fucking got scammed.
[233:22.62]I got scammed.
[233:24.62]And a bunch of people were like, yeah, dude, we got fucking scammed.
[233:28.16]I would be, I would be freaking out.
[233:31.30]I'd be like, how do I fix this as fast as possible?
[233:33.74]How do I make sure this is fixed immediately?
[233:37.53]I would never want anyone to think that I genuinely was just trying to take their money or something.
[233:42.67]I would try to, you know, not scam people.
[233:45.79]If people really thought that it was, oh, wow, dude, this is, like, kind of fucked up.
[233:49.95]I would not sleep until that was fixed, at least enough.
[233:56.89]I hate that idea.
[233:57.59]It kind of keeps me up at night sometimes.
[233:59.35]Where it's like, okay, wait, people are buying a bunch of shit.
[234:04.71]Okay.
[234:04.83]Okay.
[234:07.62]What if they don't like it?
[234:10.32]It kind of keeps me up.
[234:12.08]Sometimes.
[234:12.44]Are you going to do the signed playing cards?
[234:18.16]Hold on a minute.
[234:20.12]Are you going to do signed playing cards for the Mr. Green stream?
[234:26.59]Where'd you get that?
[234:27.17]Who told you that?
[234:28.93]Who told you there was going to be a Mr. Green stream?
[234:32.47]I don't remember anybody ever saying that.
[234:36.73]I did I don't remember ever saying I don't know who told you that that I was going to get into five to ten thousand dollars of prosthetics and be Mr. Green's doing something I mean why would you get that idea who would who would tell you that I don't think it was me whoever it was they're in trouble
[235:12.59]Overleaked that.
[235:15.02]I'm not happy about it.
[235:20.32]Wink wink.
[235:25.16]That's the next stream.
[235:26.86]That's the next stream.
[235:27.50]Okay.
[235:28.06]Hey, this is late night.
[235:28.86]No one's here.
[235:29.57]No one's... This is literally... It was almost hour number 10.
[235:35.81]It's like 11 o'clock Pacific.
[235:36.85]No one's even here right now.
[235:39.48]There's 12,000 people here.
[235:41.68]Yeah, but there is a lot of people here.
[235:43.99]That's a lot of people still here.
[235:47.99]Oops.
[235:50.27]I'm not going to announce anything about it yet.
[235:54.49]Mr. Greens is going to do a stream and it should be a lot of fun.
[236:02.84]Wait, you said, you said so.
[236:05.23]You said you're going to dress up in a big, a big fat suit and paint your body green and... Wait, hold on.
[236:12.61]You said this after you smoked three joints.
[236:16.19]When did I smoke joints on stream?
[236:20.95]I did?
[236:21.37]Is it going to be this year?
[236:24.27]I hope so.
[236:32.67]trying to make it this year the hope is that somewhere into December this would be happening he's gonna shove a dick you said this during the Bugsnak stream yeah but I know it was never real it's real now
[237:00.11]Alright, let's go.
[237:01.01]Let's play.
[237:01.59]Let's play.
[237:01.93]But yeah, I'm not going to give any details on it until I really want to.
[237:07.57]But the next big thing to do is Mr. Greenstream.
[237:14.15]And just like baseball, you'll know about it.
[237:16.33]But you won't really know about it until it happens, really.
[237:21.63]So, it should be fun.
[237:23.97]A lot of ideas.
[237:25.37]A lot of things that I want to do.
[237:26.21]Let's see if it works.
[237:29.75]Okay.
[237:37.46]I have 30 grand.
[237:39.10]What do I want to do with it?
[237:40.46]What are your thoughts on sherbet ice cream?
[237:44.09]I love sherbet ice cream.
[237:44.81]It's fantastic.
[237:48.11]I wish I was in the mood for it more.
[238:01.93]I will tell you this.
[238:03.47]No, no more leaking.
[238:04.81]I just said, alright, that's it.
[238:05.81]You're not going to hear anything else.
[238:06.91]And now I'm just like, well, you know what else I want to tell you?
[238:09.37]32,000.
[238:14.21]This is a 5%.
[238:14.45]I want it.
[238:14.73]20 grand.
[238:15.01]Give it to me.
[238:19.06]I'm at 8%.
[238:41.24]I still got 10 grand?
[238:43.87]Alright, let's do it.
[238:46.53]Land auction.
[238:47.37]Okay, so I'm gonna say right in the middle.
[238:53.07]That's the idea.
[238:53.67]Got it.
[239:01.24]He wants to talk about it so bad.
[239:02.58]Nothing will ever match the pain of having to keep the dollhouse completely under wraps for almost a full year.
[239:10.49]It was so painful.
[239:12.81]I want to just scream it every day.
[239:15.51]But I think it made that show way more fun.
[239:29.19]Okay.
[239:30.41]No more.
[239:31.41]No more leaking.
[239:33.39]And no more moles.
[239:34.95]Okay.
[239:43.63]Not a bad start.
[239:45.97]This is right here.
[239:47.07]Perfect.
[239:51.70]I need to make some cash.
[239:52.90]Let's go right side.
[239:57.76]I'm not going to upgrade this pipe yet.
[240:00.04]It's probably a bad idea.
[240:03.09]Alright, right here.
[240:03.69]Alright, let's get some... Go left.
[240:14.94]Yeah.
[240:17.66]Yeah.
[240:22.38]I just don't want this to overflow.
[240:24.24]Which it really shouldn't, because... It's only level... What, level two?
[240:28.57]Or level one.
[240:32.23]Go right.
[240:34.23]Once I get about... Two grand is when I can really start to do some stuff.
[240:40.23]Well, I'm not gonna do anything yet.
[240:45.12]Over a dollar, man.
[240:49.12]Okay.
[240:49.70]So now...
[240:56.20]Stay on the right.
[240:57.12]There's no reason to stop.
[241:00.15]Upgrade the vans.
[241:01.79]Okay.
[241:06.09]Let's get a... No.
[241:08.09]Bulls.
[241:12.85]Remind me to upgrade the bulls after this.
[241:19.75]Alright.
[241:19.99]Hold it.
[241:21.19]Hold it.
[241:21.47]Alright.
[241:24.52]Straight down.
[241:26.99]I think I'm just gonna do another one.
[241:35.68]Yeah.
[241:36.92]Alright, let's upgrade these.
[242:03.02]Okay.
[242:04.22]Uh, should I sell?
[242:06.20]Moles, moles, moles.
[242:08.46]Oh, shit.
[242:09.72]This is a huge one, too.
[242:10.80]I'll connect this one down there.
[242:14.56]67.
[242:14.58]That's not terrible.
[242:17.04]It's not great, either.
[242:18.06]I need money, though.
[242:26.15]Come on.
[242:26.55]71.
[242:26.57]69.
[242:28.83]Come on.
[242:29.05]70.
[242:29.07]70 cents.
[242:33.20]70 cents.
[242:43.22]God damn it.
[242:43.62]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[242:47.25]Not right side yet.
[242:54.95]Yeah, this is a big one.
[242:55.83]Let's double drain it.
[243:05.88]Okay.
[243:06.86]Double drain incoming.
[243:07.82]Some moles out here.
[243:24.59]That has 90.
[243:25.01]I'm doing right side.
[243:26.11]Close enough.
[243:47.46]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[243:56.30]Just do them all.
[243:56.82]Just get them all out here.
[243:57.56]Okay, well, this can go this way.
[244:03.42]And this can go this way.
[244:04.42]Alright.
[244:08.31]Sell.
[244:12.93]Yeah.
[244:15.15]Oh.
[244:20.73]Is there anything else down here?
[244:21.41]What are you going to be for Halloween?
[244:26.67]A ninja.
[244:39.69]Is it even worth doing this?
[244:40.65]Yeah.
[244:47.42]Find something?
[244:53.12]The good part about splitting this is you don't have to upgrade the drill twice, which is good.
[244:59.62]Although I don't know how much there really is left.
[245:09.69]Should I upgrade the dowsers?
[245:10.67]I feel like I haven't really been doing it at all.
[245:15.11]This might be it.
[245:18.12]November.
[245:18.52]This is probably it.
[245:27.59]Yes, yeah, I got it.
[245:29.13]Let's get out of here.
[245:29.69]Sell it.
[245:40.50]Alright, is there anything else?
[245:42.52]I don't think so.
[245:43.14]I mean, I guess I could check here.
[245:46.34]I think it's empty.
[245:50.50]Zero planning Andy?
[245:51.92]What do you mean?
[245:53.78]I got it all.
[245:56.12]Yeah, zero planning Andy.
[245:57.34]I'm good.
[245:58.90]I'm going to get the bonus too.
[245:59.78]15 grand.
[246:04.34]Oops, sorry.
[246:07.68]Also too, you guys have had about 10 hours to hear this.
[246:13.05]Is the audio actually better?
[246:15.35]Is this mic better?
[246:16.63]Are we happy with this?
[246:19.37]Does everybody think this is good?
[246:22.63]Yeah?
[246:24.87]Okay, cool.
[246:26.75]Perfect.
[246:27.43]It's so much better.
[246:30.10]Alright, that makes me happy.
[246:34.84]Stock auction again.
[246:35.84]I don't think I want to participate.
[246:40.08]I want more money.
[246:40.62]I already have 8% of the shares.
[246:42.43]That'll be fine.
[246:42.89]I mean, they're all going to be bad, but I'll try this one.
[246:53.88]Never mind.
[246:56.11]I guess I'll take the terrible one.
[246:57.27]This is the end of the desert.
[247:08.81]48 chi- no, no, no, four.
[247:16.03]If this guy's gonna buy it, it's like, that's me.
[247:19.85]Hold on, I can just wait till it gets all the way down.
[247:22.00]They don't have any money.
[247:28.85]Okay.
[247:29.81]Thanks for the 4%.
[247:30.61]I got 12% now.
[247:32.67]That's perfect.
[247:33.47]That was me up there.
[247:36.79]I got money.
[247:37.25]I'm in a good spot.
[247:57.66]Begin.
[247:57.84]Begin.
[248:00.83]Got some over here.
[248:03.56]Pretty big one on the left.
[248:07.57]Alright.
[248:24.92]I can just barely make it.
[248:25.72]You need coffee?
[248:28.23]Um, don't drink too much coffee too late, though.
[248:29.95]It's actually really... Shouldn't have too much caffeine too late.
[248:38.39]Really?
[248:38.65]Right when the price goes down?
[248:56.75]I'm just gonna farm this for a second.
[248:57.81]Whoa!
[249:04.50]Left side.
[249:05.08]Get you about two grand.
[249:20.02]Alright.
[249:21.81]Uh, there was one over here.
[249:22.57]This is a little one, though.
[249:35.97]I'm obsessed with the moles.
[249:47.17]One there.
[250:04.89]Alright, right side.
[250:16.06]Left side.
[250:35.75]Okay.
[250:37.37]Now, you need to go this way.
[250:40.07]I'm gonna, it's gonna, straight down.
[250:47.93]Can you put your channel on television so I can watch with my parents out in the living room?
[250:52.59]Um, go get the app.
[250:53.61]There's a, there's a TV app.
[250:55.79]You can put it on TV.
[250:56.93]It's on Apple TV, it's on Xbox, it's on PlayStation.
[250:59.43]You can put it on TV.
[251:14.13]Alright, good find.
[251:14.81]Shit.
[251:27.85]Okay.
[251:30.05]Stop delivering.
[251:31.04]Okay, start storing.
[251:33.30]September.
[251:33.84]Alright, get the storage up.
[251:39.16]I don't know if there's anything else over here.
[251:51.31]Fully upgraded.
[251:51.99]Yep.
[251:58.07]Store it.
[251:58.43]Store it to the very end.
[252:05.21]Here we go.
[252:05.75]Check this out.
[252:06.15]This is gonna be huge.
[252:06.79]$1.30 or $1.40.
[252:08.17]Come on.
[252:08.33]And... Not yet.
[252:08.78]Not yet.
[252:21.06]Not yet.
[252:23.24]Oh, it's on the left side.
[252:24.20]Hold on.
[252:24.46]No, no, no.
[252:24.90]Not yet.
[252:25.14]Not yet.
[252:25.40]Not yet.
[252:25.70]Not yet.
[252:26.02]Not yet.
[252:31.54]Go.
[252:41.09]There's no more.
[252:41.85]There's definitely no more.
[252:43.19]That's a good haul.
[252:48.19]Even if I missed it, it's too bad.
[252:50.44]I just want to know.
[252:51.22]Send a mole over there.
[252:51.86]There's nothing else, right?
[252:58.74]Yeah.
[252:58.94]Give me that bonus.
[253:00.20]18 grand.
[253:07.57]You want to know where the gas is?
[253:09.11]I'll train my moles to sniff it out.
[253:10.97]Gas.
[253:12.37]Buy my new machinery to use gas to your advantage.
[253:16.55]We're moving again this time.
[253:17.29]We're going to the plains, which has the profitable but tricky natural gas.
[253:24.51]Nope.
[253:25.39]Not yet.
[253:26.71]We're using a diamond.
[253:30.14]Gas is not worth much if you let it escape through a rig.
[253:33.26]Be sure to close valves to direct it.
[253:37.54]Before you can sell gas to a company, visit Fred and buy the left link or right link upgrade first.
[253:46.06]Oh, Jesus.
[253:46.74]Really?
[253:52.35]Let me do this first.
[253:53.11]Alright.
[253:56.33]Point me in the direction of a insane.
[254:01.81]Oh, that's good.
[254:04.07]Write.
[254:04.49]Okay, so write ink.
[254:10.03]Okay, write ink.
[254:12.94]Upgrade the mold.
[254:18.32]What about this though?
[254:19.22]Moles will look for gas near every cell they uncover.
[254:23.36]What is it?
[254:23.70]Do I need a different thing to upgrade it?
[254:26.68]Or to pull it out?
[254:27.48]Why does he look away every time chat erupts?
[254:37.35]It's the natural order of my head movement to the screen.
[254:44.13]You need the connector for 30k.
[254:55.38]What else is available?
[255:02.56]Oh.
[255:03.84]Okay, so it's from the bottom.
[255:08.46]I don't have enough money.
[255:09.14]I could take a loan out.
[255:12.43]I'm taking a loan out.
[255:24.33]I'm taking out a lung.
[255:25.33]Because remember, I got that guy to tell me where the best place was because I gave him a diamond.
[255:43.99]And remember, I bought this too.
[255:46.58]So if there's gas down there, I want to be able to get it.
[255:51.08]We're doing right link because the right one is the one that is at 80 something cents.
[255:59.30]Alright, so just don't lose.
[256:00.42]I'm not doing the stock unless it's... I mean, why not?
[256:07.06]5%?
[256:08.86]No, I'm not doing it.
[256:13.14]Alright, so I got enough to go for it.
[256:17.26]Wait, I have to do that.
[256:18.76]Oh shit, I have to do this.
[256:27.01]What if they're stupid and they didn't buy it?
[256:29.21]I could probably just buy it.
[256:33.95]I can't believe so.
[256:34.59]It's a 5% share of the company.
[256:36.31]I can't believe no one's done this.
[256:37.33]You're not going to let me do it, right?
[256:40.01]Oh, of course not.
[256:42.33]I can't believe that.
[256:43.23]I would have bought it.
[256:44.21]I just would have taken another loan out.
[256:45.45]Alright.
[256:53.16]So he said that this is the place to go.
[256:56.52]Right here.
[257:01.90]Alright, they don't even care.
[257:02.92]I got the insider info.
[257:04.60]So there's apparently a shitload of stuff here.
[257:06.10]This is probably a huge one.
[257:09.14]Okay, let's go.
[257:09.65]Alright, let's come on.
[257:13.83]Let's do it.
[257:16.79]Use a pipeline to transport gas to right ink and oh no, we'll make the oil price more right than ever.
[257:23.75]Alright, let's do it.
[257:24.49]So that's a hazard.
[257:54.72]That gas, what does it look?
[257:55.89]It's a good blue, right?
[257:59.71]That's a major deposit right here.
[258:08.30]Don't go too far so I can't get it right.
[258:18.11]Because I could get in trouble here and not be able to cross.
[258:21.26]Yeah, you can't intersect.
[258:23.16]Shit.
[258:23.58]So I gotta make sure there's a path to go this way.
[258:26.64]This is a huge deposit, too.
[258:27.70]We're gonna do two here.
[258:38.85]Yeah, this is a big one.
[258:39.93]In fact, let's go like this.
[258:40.98]Because then I'm gonna go bang, bang.
[258:55.62]gas holy that would have been bad go deposit it
[259:35.98]Look at this.
[259:36.40]This is perfect.
[259:54.18]Companies cannot drill.
[259:55.64]What?
[259:55.84]Wait, what?
[259:58.32]What do you mean?
[260:02.71]What do you mean?
[260:03.95]Left.
[260:04.15]What do you mean?
[260:04.71]Hold on.
[260:06.33]I can't connect this to what?
[260:07.95]What are you talking about?
[260:09.61]Left is 126.
[260:10.21]That's fine.
[260:14.41]You have to connect your pipe to it.
[260:19.47]I do?
[260:29.54]Wait, what?
[260:36.81]Now this has to go... So this, uh... What have I done?
[260:43.82]Is it okay?
[260:47.26]Um... Fuck.
[260:50.48]What if I go like this?
[260:51.28]Can I connect?
[260:51.68]I'm gonna connect these two.
[260:52.46]I might have just blown this.
[260:55.52]Maybe.
[260:57.02]And then... Uh-oh.
[261:02.58]Ah, wait.
[261:02.96]I can do that.
[261:03.76]Is this gonna work?
[261:04.18]Okay.
[261:13.06]Engine gas is now escaping through a rig.
[261:14.94]Close the rig to prevent this inlet.
[261:22.45]How much is this worth?
[261:28.55]What's happening?
[261:32.50]Oh, it's a... It's a buff.
[261:43.59]It's a buff.
[261:45.23]It's like an overheal to your price.
[261:48.82]Okay, I get it.
[261:52.42]Oh, that's kind of sad.
[261:58.49]That was so much money.
[261:59.99]What a waste.
[262:03.17]What's going on?
[262:18.51]Do you understand it now?
[262:19.33]Yeah.
[262:25.06]That's true.
[262:27.70]Let's store some of this now.
[262:53.06]This is a big one Big money on the left here
[263:23.41]Don't let that spill.
[263:37.06]Alright, pull back from the left.
[263:38.54]Pull back from the left.
[263:39.44]No reason to do that.
[263:40.02]People can go to the right if they want.
[263:46.32]20 grand so far.
[263:46.89]This is pretty good.
[263:54.64]Okay, nice.
[263:55.47]Is this even in there?
[263:56.15]Is this in?
[263:59.88]I feel like it's not sucking anything.
[264:01.84]It is, okay.
[264:18.49]26 grand.
[264:18.95]I'm doing good.
[264:19.71]What are these?
[264:20.23]Upgrades?
[264:20.99]This looks fucking terrible.
[264:23.47]This is real.
[264:25.11]I just looked over and I'm realizing just how bad this looks.
[264:35.05]I forgot that people were watching me play.
[264:38.96]This is really ugly.
[264:46.93]This is supposed to be a mega deposit.
[264:50.24]I'm just going to go this way, whatever.
[264:52.76]Okay.
[264:53.24]Gas!
[264:57.42]Gas!
[265:09.11]Almost got it all.
[265:11.57]It's okay.
[265:12.57]25 grand is pretty good.
[265:20.29]I don't think I want to buy another stock auction.
[265:22.69]Shit.
[265:25.27]28 grand.
[265:25.67]Okay, I'm going to... This is for 1%.
[265:28.47]You guys can have it.
[265:29.05]Who cares?
[265:29.81]I'll buy it at $1.
[265:33.36]If you were a fish, what kind of fish would you be?
[265:45.43]Hmm.
[265:47.61]Who you are, the dumbest person in the world.
[265:50.03]Okay.
[265:52.21]Enjoy your, uh, 2% or 10, like $9,000.
[265:56.71]Um, I'd probably be a an electric eel.
[266:00.84]Seems like the funnest answer.
[266:18.19]Hulls will look for gas.
[266:19.35]I think that's good.
[266:20.57]I'm going to get it.
[266:29.84]Paid my loan back, right?
[266:30.90]Yeah, I did.
[266:37.48]You'd be an ocean sunfish.
[266:39.08]Hey, that's kind of cool.
[266:41.06]Ocean sunfish?
[266:47.23]Okay, do they know that this was great?
[266:49.33]Can they see that?
[266:49.93]Okay, they can see the same map.
[267:10.54]Junk.
[267:13.27]Junk.
[267:15.15]Junk.
[267:17.73]Alright, now I understand how gas works.
[267:23.21]That's what an ocean sunfish looks like.
[267:24.93]I thought they were going to be this beautiful orange and yellow and fire.
[267:32.77]It's been 10 hours.
[267:33.39]Give me a break.
[267:35.14]Okay, when a mole smells gas nearby, we'll uncover it for you.
[267:48.06]gas gas okay don't touch the gas whoa is that gas I don't know if that's gas or not I hope this is not gas
[268:19.68]Is it?
[268:20.40]Don't be gassed.
[268:22.34]Alright, nice.
[268:25.60]We're good.
[268:28.40]Alright, hold off, hold off, hold off.
[268:37.84]Alright, I need to upgrade this.
[268:46.90]Not yet.
[268:47.24]Hold on.
[269:12.55]Sell it!
[269:15.88]Hurry!
[269:18.44]There's so much to make on that right side right now.
[269:20.84]Thank God.
[269:21.28]Alright, we're good.
[269:21.99]Cool.
[269:26.97]Alright.
[269:30.48]I think I'm just gonna double this up.
[269:45.00]Gonna start to get crazy here.
[269:45.86]Alright, gas.
[269:46.62]I gotta be ready.
[269:53.01]Is it gonna start to fill up?
[269:55.17]Fine.
[269:56.07]Both dog shit prices.
[269:57.43]I'm not gonna do that.
[269:59.65]Terrible prices.
[270:12.14]Can I get something better than 70 cents, please?
[270:16.91]78, come on, it's climbing.
[270:18.11]85, alright, go.
[270:33.68]Good haul.
[270:36.36]Alright, now, where is there more of this shit?
[270:40.04]Could've done the gas.
[270:40.74]I could've done the gas, I don't have it on the left side.
[270:44.11]Um, alright, I need some more moles.
[270:58.63]Good.
[270:59.87]Yep.
[271:00.61]Okay, and this is rock.
[271:04.91]Find something over here.
[271:05.59]That'd be perfect.
[271:11.82]You're gonna do it.
[271:12.72]Go, uh, go right side.
[271:14.36]A few of you.
[271:21.12]Anything?
[271:21.40]Okay, there's something this way.
[271:23.22]There's two gas piles right here.
[271:30.92]How big are they?
[271:31.54]It's got a diamond knife.
[271:46.23]Don't hit the gas.
[272:13.02]Use the gas?
[272:14.50]It has to go this way.
[272:18.70]Salt is too far away.
[272:30.72]I guess I could put... Could I connect?
[272:32.22]I don't know.
[272:32.86]I guess I could connect to here.
[272:33.96]No, it's too far away.
[272:40.22]Hold off.
[272:41.00]Hold off.
[272:41.44]Hold off.
[272:41.74]Hold off.
[272:42.82]Left side.
[272:44.74]Looking a little crazy.
[272:48.29]There's so much over here.
[272:56.35]I dicked around way too much in the beginning.
[273:11.19]Okay, I started on the wrong side.
[273:12.41]The left side was so much better.
[273:18.18]The right side was terrible.
[273:19.70]It was two deposits and then no gas.
[273:23.90]That sucked.
[273:24.36]Let's get this out of the way.
[273:28.39]Another 1%, 40 grand.
[273:30.31]Imagine clicking on that.
[273:32.41]Just build more oil wells.
[273:33.37]Yeah, I gotta build more of those.
[273:41.16]I'll buy it at a dollar.
[273:49.89]God.
[273:51.65]Ricardo again.
[273:52.37]Alright, that's fine.
[274:02.19]Maybe upgrade the joints.
[274:03.83]I can do three.
[274:06.69]That seems like amazing.
[274:08.26]I think I need this.
[274:11.78]I need that.
[274:12.70]I can go one, two, three.
[274:13.86]The branches just get so much bigger.
[274:15.08]Alright, save the rest.
[274:28.71]That's a good upgrade.
[274:29.65]Yeah.
[274:37.93]Well, right here seems like a good idea.
[274:42.97]that's hot real estate right there come on dude really I want that alright I'm good alright I can do three branches now I want to take my pants off so bad you know I do just sit here you can now can you now can connect five pipes to each joint
[275:24.94]perfect place for gas right there this is a big one alright I gotta plan this out this is a big one look at how huge this one is so I'm thinking bang right like right here yep so it's gonna go bang
[275:43.10]right here wait wait okay so should I go short and then be able to have okay so listen should I go just don't go all the way down should I go a little bit down so then I can connect three to that that makes sense doesn't it see what I'm saying like go like this and then be able to go one two three
[276:14.65]That's not dumb.
[276:15.33]So I go like, I'll go this way.
[276:22.34]Right?
[276:25.84]It's kind of one, two, three.
[276:28.44]One, two, three.
[276:31.60]This is the gas line.
[276:32.66]No, I wanted a horse.
[276:44.95]Yeah, so that's the gas line.
[276:46.43]You know what I'm saying?
[276:47.99]This one's going to go this way.
[276:49.25]Could be another gas line.
[276:51.19]He just wasted a year.
[276:52.09]No, I didn't.
[276:52.51]I'm good.
[277:08.66]Same deal with this.
[277:09.50]I don't want to... Oh, careful.
[277:12.52]Careful.
[278:16.54]Alright.
[278:16.94]It's about to get real.
[278:25.85]77 cents.
[278:26.15]It's enough.
[278:27.07]Start selling.
[278:30.31]Alright.
[278:30.56]Stop, stop, stop.
[278:31.14]No, no, no.
[278:40.28]Make some balls.
[278:47.26]Two people sell.
[278:56.69]I need the cash flow.
[279:10.16]You know what to do.
[279:10.72]Let's go.
[279:13.78]Everybody.
[279:14.54]Dollar.
[279:15.62]The dollar.
[279:16.06]Dollar.
[279:22.57]Nice.
[279:22.73]Alright.
[279:25.76]Back over here.
[279:26.30]Right side.
[279:26.76]80 cents.
[279:39.03]Oh, we don't hit any gas.
[279:43.01]Shit.
[279:43.37]There's another one right here.
[279:55.89]I need some more horses and I need another one of these.
[279:59.01]For sure.
[280:05.64]You know what?
[280:06.00]Just so I don't have a problem.
[280:21.58]So much gas.
[280:23.22]Alright, speaking of gas, I think it's time... It's time to hold.
[280:30.93]Let's store a bunch of shit.
[280:32.19]I'm gonna make a... I'm doing gas.
[280:34.63]And I'm dumping it onto the right side here in a little bit.
[280:47.40]Okay, so how am I gonna do this?
[280:50.48]I'm thinking, so I connect this through here to there, right?
[280:54.30]If I go like that... No.
[280:58.06]This.
[280:59.66]Okay, so this is what we're doing.
[281:01.94]Everybody, shh!
[281:04.46]This is gonna go like this.
[281:07.13]We're gonna start to dump.
[281:17.03]This is dumb, but who cares?
[281:22.06]Wait, I gotta be ready.
[281:22.96]I gotta do this.
[281:23.54]I'm not ready to do this now.
[281:25.02]Am I ready to do this?
[281:29.59]Alright, hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[281:30.93]Pause the game.
[281:31.47]What am I doing?
[281:32.91]Okay, this is gonna connect.
[281:34.91]It's gonna... I gotta close the valve.
[281:46.07]It's gonna go... I have to close this valve.
[281:52.43]Close them now.
[281:54.67]Wait, hold on.
[281:55.73]If the gas comes through here, then it needs... This one needs to be closed?
[282:01.76]No.
[282:02.56]This has to be closed.
[282:05.82]And that's it.
[282:06.22]So if I do this... I'm just gonna try it.
[282:09.38]Who cares?
[282:09.83]Fuck it.
[282:10.19]Here we go.
[282:12.19]You guys ready?
[282:12.71]I fucked it up.
[282:17.63]I blew it.
[282:17.99]I upgraded the stupid...
[282:46.56]I mean, I blew it really bad, but I made 27 grand.
[282:51.12]I really fucked it up.
[282:55.08]Oh, I could have gone up here.
[282:57.68]Is there any more?
[282:59.02]I don't know.
[283:03.36]I thought I blew it.
[283:12.95]No, I got it all.
[283:13.75]Okay.
[283:14.71]What is that?
[283:15.19]A diamond?
[283:16.85]I got it all.
[283:21.00]You only wasted a little bit?
[283:22.12]That wasn't that bad.
[283:24.04]Stop spending money on dumb things.
[283:25.42]I don't even know what that means, though.
[283:27.04]Like, I'm a dumb person.
[283:29.92]Okay.
[283:34.16]Now, the stock auction.
[283:35.16]This is 4%, so I'm going to be ready.
[283:43.97]I would be at 16% of the company.
[283:45.89]Alright, if this goes under 15, I'm doing it.
[283:57.09]Shit.
[284:00.15]Did he buy his own shares back?
[284:01.58]Ah, this thing is... I need more money.
[284:24.76]Only 1,100 bucks for this.
[284:27.00]Uh, I'm gonna ax... Okay.
[284:33.64]One diamond.
[284:35.15]Yeah, let's do it.
[284:35.87]70 cents on the left?
[284:38.85]No.
[284:39.03]That was some lone shit.
[284:42.89]Get the left link.
[284:45.51]Actually a good idea.
[284:48.98]Do I have enough money to... Okay, I do.
[284:51.10]I don't wanna go broke, though.
[284:51.90]I have gas on both sides.
[285:00.51]Ooh, really?
[285:01.35]Okay, no one is gonna go that way.
[285:02.61]They're gonna think I'm stupid.
[285:11.69]Okay.
[285:13.84]Alright.
[285:17.86]Let's do it.
[285:21.34]Use a pipeline to transport gas to left ink and Kyle will raise the oil price.
[285:25.10]Okay.
[285:26.56]So... Let's be smart.
[285:31.42]And I'm going to stop fast-forwarding.
[285:32.66]I feel like it's getting me in trouble.
[285:36.34]Gas.
[285:39.58]Gas in the middle.
[285:40.28]Okay, this is kind of shitty.
[285:46.80]There's a lot of gas.
[285:47.88]Okay, please tell me there's a big deposit right here.
[285:49.76]Because I could go wham, wham, wham that way and make it like $5 a share.
[285:53.68]There's one down here.
[286:28.36]Shut up.
[286:29.16]Really?
[286:47.15]When I sell to the left Twix, the right Twix starts being a better price.
[286:50.65]Okay.
[286:53.90]Now, stop fast-forwarding.
[287:01.62]and then I can go wham okay gas is here I could go like that that alright I gotta find something over here I get a little bit this way
[287:28.99]55 cents.
[287:29.35]Fuck off.
[287:31.23]Bullshit.
[287:42.37]Better.
[287:42.63]Have you people seriously been watching this for ten and a half hours?
[287:54.11]Not this.
[287:54.67]I've only been doing this for about two and a half.
[288:04.98]I'm just going to go down.
[288:05.78]Start getting this upgraded.
[288:11.52]There's a ton of gas, so I could really make like 50 grand if I do this right.
[288:16.64]If I plan this correctly.
[288:17.66]I need more horses.
[288:26.81]This is triple now.
[288:37.32]oh boy oh my god okay it might be time for gas but no it's not what am I talking about
[289:09.26]Dogshit prices.
[289:10.15]Give me a break.
[289:13.25]Can you not be 30 cents?
[289:15.07]Go up.
[289:17.45]Seriously, what is this bullshit?
[289:21.27]Oh boy, oh boy.
[289:22.69]It's gonna break.
[289:23.19]Snap a gas?
[289:36.99]Do a rig just for gas.
[289:38.32]But when I touch it, doesn't it start going?
[289:47.62]I'm going for this.
[289:48.22]I'm going to try this.
[289:48.94]Let's see if this is a bad idea.
[290:00.21]I'm going to go for gas on the left side here in a second.
[290:01.95]Alright, suck up some more oil.
[290:11.74]OK, here we go.
[290:17.79]OK, it's time.
[290:19.79]Let's go.
[290:36.74]Help!
[290:41.50]That's 50 cents there?
[291:15.00]I'm going bang, bang, bang.
[291:22.18]I have so many silos.
[291:24.23]Alright, are you guys ready?
[291:34.09]This is going to be fucking crazy.
[291:42.55]right side it's November alright I gotta make this happen now here we go oh I didn't even connect that
[292:22.03]Oh, come on.
[292:22.99]Ah, shit.
[292:26.57]Why do I have to just make 20 grand in the last five seconds?
[292:30.45]Just, I plan it better.
[292:32.01]Shit.
[292:38.04]He's pretending.
[292:38.94]I wish that were true.
[292:40.76]Eyelid was just weird.
[292:47.49]Okay.
[292:50.75]What, 3%?
[292:53.58]I'll do it under 10.
[292:54.24]Need to go to bed?
[293:01.18]I'm good.
[293:05.85]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[293:07.45]Under 10, under 10.
[293:11.69]Ricardo, okay.
[293:12.91]He's actually climbing.
[293:20.37]Moles.
[293:21.79]Faster.
[293:24.64]And another diamond.
[293:28.54]Close the valve before you drill into the gas.
[293:31.34]I know, dude.
[293:32.16]It's just like when you're on a timer and you're a fucking brain slug like me.
[293:40.31]I get caught up.
[293:44.65]Stop being stupid.
[293:45.47]I know.
[293:47.49]Pause to think.
[293:48.27]When I pause to think, I just go and then I forget.
[293:54.47]Uh, I am gonna do this, though.
[293:59.30]Oh, that's junk.
[293:59.92]Okay.
[294:02.60]Show me where the best one is.
[294:03.62]Oh, okay.
[294:08.06]Alright.
[294:08.76]So this one's apparently huge.
[294:10.89]Don't bid on that.
[294:12.75]I gotta make at least 30 or 40 grand this time.
[294:19.83]My moles are better.
[294:20.57]Okay.
[294:38.14]Good.
[294:38.42]Alright, that's a big one.
[294:40.08]Gas right there.
[294:42.30]Gas right there.
[294:43.90]Okay, let's get this started.
[294:46.82]This is perfect.
[294:47.38]What, it's going to go straight down?
[295:02.38]Get the horses out already.
[295:03.54]I want to make sure that I don't get a bunch of bullshit.
[295:06.48]Look at how much is over there already.
[295:10.77]It's gonna be a big head start here.
[295:12.01]That's a head start.
[295:19.19]Actually, probably the best thing that could happen.
[295:20.41]Alright, slow down.
[295:22.77]Now.
[295:25.75]Silo.
[295:26.59]Right here.
[295:29.43]That's... Three... Okay, two of you start storing.
[295:36.67]Gas here.
[295:40.60]Okay.
[295:43.04]Moles.
[295:43.58]Get back to work over here.
[295:44.56]Gotta find something on this side.
[295:47.26]Stop selling over there.
[295:56.43]Just store it.
[295:57.39]Okay.
[296:02.18]Cool.
[296:02.78]Alright.
[296:04.16]So... Oh, shit.
[296:05.92]People are just sitting there.
[296:08.32]Pause it.
[296:11.19]This way.
[296:11.65]I'm going to do some gas.
[296:28.28]Okay.
[296:28.72]Now, where is it?
[296:29.80]Alright.
[296:30.60]Stop this.
[296:40.25]I hope that's not gas.
[296:44.79]This here.
[296:45.12]I hope that's not gas.
[297:09.68]Not gas.
[297:10.30]Okay, we're good.
[297:10.88]Okay.
[297:17.45]Alright, so this is going to be the gas valve.
[297:20.39]There's another one right there.
[297:21.31]Yeah, fuck that.
[297:25.32]Let's go.
[297:25.68]Check this out.
[297:39.99]Start the flow.
[297:40.61]Come on.
[297:41.67]Fill it up.
[298:04.49]Keep filling it.
[298:07.89]Good.
[298:08.03]5k.
[298:08.07]Let's go.
[298:08.31]Keep going.
[298:19.24]I might do some... I gotta fill up... Let's get another one of these.
[298:21.50]It's only July.
[298:24.00]I'm fine.
[298:27.18]I got 10k.
[298:30.96]Alright.
[298:32.68]Start storing it.
[298:33.78]Start storing it.
[298:34.66]Because I want to be able to do a gas run.
[298:54.86]Okay, there's more here.
[299:01.41]August.
[299:06.56]Alright.
[299:10.62]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[299:11.96]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[299:12.60]Enough, enough, enough, enough.
[299:13.32]Alright, let's fucking do this.
[299:14.96]It's September.
[299:15.90]I got a full... I've got... I got five Mega Man tanks full of energy.
[299:20.54]I'm going for it.
[299:21.96]Here we go.
[299:22.34]Almost.
[299:23.14]Not yet.
[299:23.78]Um... Uh, wait.
[299:25.40]Okay.
[299:25.90]What do I... What do I... What do I do?
[299:27.88]Here we go.
[299:28.24]Alright.
[299:28.62]Pick up... Wait.
[299:31.99]I want to close... What do I want to do?
[299:33.71]Close this one.
[299:35.57]Whoa!
[299:37.53]Um... I want to close this.
[299:40.83]Oh shit.
[299:41.82]Oh shit.
[299:42.96]Oh shit.
[299:44.70]Pause it.
[299:45.20]Pause it.
[299:45.60]What do I do?
[299:48.94]This is gonna go over here and then I have to close this.
[299:53.14]Right?
[299:53.38]So I go over here.
[299:57.68]It sucks it up here and then I close this one.
[300:01.29]And then I'm gonna buy a fucking shitload of horses.
[300:03.25]I don't even care about the... I don't care.
[300:11.38]Oh my God, I'm going to be in trouble.
[300:12.72]Here we go.
[300:39.61]Yeah!
[301:39.43]I gotta, okay.
[301:41.79]I'm sure you could use a bit more oil storage capacity.
[301:43.93]Guess what?
[301:44.25]I've invented something for that.
[301:47.15]You do?
[301:48.91]A super silo?
[301:50.05]I don't have enough.
[301:55.53]Oh, man.
[301:56.25]Okay.
[301:57.07]I actually really need that.
[302:03.41]Is it for 2%?
[302:03.77]Not a whole lot.
[302:11.51]Take the loan.
[302:13.83]I'm scared of the loan because if I take the loan, let's say I take like 10 to 20 grand.
[302:18.38]I have to make sure I can pay it.
[302:23.46]2%.
[302:24.38]I have to buy the next one, no matter what it is.
[302:28.14]Alright.
[302:36.91]Should I just take like a $10,000 loan?
[303:14.64]I have to make a big, big, big, big, big one.
[303:23.14]This counts.
[303:31.87]I actually have to get this right.
[303:36.36]Okay.
[303:37.46]That's a good start.
[303:38.66]Really good start.
[303:41.20]No gas yet, though.
[303:42.20]Gas down here.
[303:44.90]Put this here.
[303:45.50]Let's go like this.
[303:48.16]Gas can grab this way.
[303:59.84]That.
[304:03.70]Looking good.
[304:05.32]Make some money.
[304:08.74]This is going to go over here.
[304:09.86]This one's going to go down.
[304:12.20]No, it's not.
[304:17.06]There's no reason to do that right now.
[304:29.34]I know the Omega silo.
[304:30.34]The Omega silo is going to go over here.
[304:31.74]I just wanted to have more storage.
[304:45.76]Good start.
[304:46.20]Come on.
[304:46.58]Keep it going.
[304:52.92]That's a triple right now.
[304:55.78]Really good start.
[304:56.56]Come on.
[305:01.46]Phenomenal start.
[305:02.28]Alright.
[305:02.94]Actually phenomenal start.
[305:03.90]Start snoring.
[305:15.97]Go straight down.
[305:27.98]Okay.
[305:35.80]Don't sell anything.
[305:36.92]Hold it for another few minutes.
[305:39.55]Go this way.
[305:43.09]And go this way.
[305:48.43]Some moles out.
[306:02.26]Okay.
[306:03.16]That ain't going anywhere.
[306:04.10]Okay.
[306:15.31]Nothing else down here?
[306:16.15]I need some more moles.
[306:17.01]Get over there.
[306:18.51]Check that shit out.
[306:19.13]There has to be something over there.
[306:22.70]I don't need money.
[306:28.92]Gas over there.
[306:29.54]Okay, right in the middle.
[306:31.94]Start selling.
[306:37.09]I need the money.
[306:40.13]That was a good time to do it.
[306:41.91]Alright.
[306:42.53]Perfect.
[306:42.83]13k.
[306:43.59]Now...
[306:54.78]I don't know if there's anything else over here.
[306:56.06]I'm gonna go this way.
[307:13.88]August?
[307:14.24]Okay, I got time.
[307:25.49]Dumbass.
[307:27.19]I'm just kidding.
[307:27.67]I'm not stupid.
[307:30.35]Gas is here.
[307:30.97]There's gas here, too.
[307:38.01]Left, idiot.
[307:41.75]I don't have any oil.
[307:42.57]Okay, this is pumping now.
[307:52.96]Store it.
[307:53.52]I'm getting ready for a gas run.
[308:01.08]Gas run coming up on the right side.
[308:02.62]It's October.
[308:03.60]Okay, time for a gas run.
[308:19.09]Is there any more shit left?
[308:21.27]Oh my god, I gotta do a gas run now.
[308:22.57]Go go go go go go go go!
[308:32.22]What?
[308:43.71]Oh my God.
[308:49.41]I think I got it.
[308:54.27]I'm good.
[308:56.54]Like there might be something here or like down here, but I think I got most of it.
[309:09.20]One tiny little thing.
[309:10.26]I paid the debt back.
[309:12.36]Alright, I got 20 grand.
[309:14.90]I'm consistently making more money than all of them.
[309:17.48]But I have to win this auction.
[309:21.32]2%.
[309:21.34]I have to buy it.
[309:40.46]stupid I was about to click I just couldn't do it I couldn't pull the trigger right okay yep 92 cents on the right side that's a huge deal especially if there's chaos
[310:12.52]Somebody got screwed.
[310:13.38]Did I get scammed?
[310:26.81]Okay, no, we're good.
[310:34.54]Thank God.
[310:36.60]Close the well before the gas.
[310:38.78]You're right.
[310:47.54]The right side is not ever going below 91, 92, whatever it was.
[310:52.04]That's a good place for gas.
[310:59.81]Alright.
[311:00.49]Come on, man.
[311:01.27]This is going to be huge.
[311:03.43]This is going to be a big deal.
[311:07.29]Go like this.
[311:09.45]I'm going to go wham, wham, wham.
[311:14.11]I'm going to prepare the gas lane first.
[311:17.88]You know what you see what I'm saying?
[311:35.54]Let's go.
[311:55.92]Beautiful.
[311:57.26]Beautiful.
[312:01.46]That's never gonna go below 92.
[312:02.52]Good start.
[312:25.56]Very good start.
[312:41.42]Okay.
[312:41.70]I need a silo.
[312:44.62]Yep.
[312:45.06]It's going to go.
[312:46.03]It's going to be a mega silo going right here.
[312:55.94]Okay, now it's time.
[312:57.04]Um, yes.
[313:38.07]I went overboard, but it's alright.
[313:41.47]July, we're good.
[313:42.25]Timing's fine.
[314:03.22]There's nothing over here.
[314:04.60]Wait.
[314:05.32]Hold on a second.
[314:05.78]Did you hear this?
[314:06.56]That was kind of... Alright, I almost did it.
[314:18.22]Please, please store it, you dummy.
[314:19.88]It's $1.20.
[314:20.36]It's $1.27 right now.
[314:20.78]Now we store it.
[314:21.38]Is there any more?
[314:50.62]We're empty.
[314:54.53]November?
[315:51.42]Always $25,000.
[315:51.98]Your camera looks like found footage.
[315:58.55]Well, you just found it.
[316:00.77]You're here now, aren't you?
[316:01.55]Alright, this is important.
[316:09.62]I have to get this.
[316:12.38]I've got the most money.
[316:16.60]This is 6%.
[316:17.70]I have to buy it.
[316:18.98]I'm going to buy it probably around...
[316:23.62]Right now.
[316:24.28]Like in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[316:29.76]Fine.
[316:30.82]6%.
[316:31.48]I'm at 18%.
[316:34.75]I can afford that.
[316:49.31]I can afford the horses though, but I haven't really been using them that much.
[317:03.81]Bright ink is never going under $1.01.
[317:05.43]Alright, give me something good here.
[317:19.70]Where?
[317:20.68]I don't know.
[317:29.08]This is right next to a 24, though.
[317:30.32]That might suck.
[317:37.98]Maybe right here.
[317:40.74]Top middle.
[317:43.18]This is probably the safest place.
[317:50.86]Either that or over here.
[317:56.65]It's not a shitty one.
[317:57.55]Okay.
[318:09.56]We really want to uncover right because that's where we're going to spend most of the time.
[318:15.37]Gas, two gases.
[318:16.33]Okay, I could make up literally everything right now.
[318:20.49]This is going to be a huge fucking deal.
[318:22.43]Okay, this is a big deal.
[318:24.88]Here we go.
[318:26.58]Let me plan this.
[318:28.20]If I go here, I can go one.
[318:39.14]I need to take a loan out.
[319:58.41]Yes, yes.
[320:04.27]Is the plan.
[320:04.63]The plan is to go here.
[320:06.40]And then here.
[320:09.64]And that's going to.
[320:11.06]I mean, you're talking about a million dollars.
[320:37.64]Alright.
[320:38.02]Maybe we should start the storage process now.
[320:50.14]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[321:02.35]Half and half.
[321:02.79]So I'm going to use store because I need to have enough for the gas.
[321:12.90]11 hours?
[321:13.18]Oh, shit.
[321:13.66]Nice.
[321:21.45]Okay.
[321:21.73]Should I store now?
[321:23.51]In June?
[321:24.01]Let's fill up one of these.
[321:24.81]Let's fill the super silo up.
[321:40.14]Perfect.
[321:42.52]Perfect.
[321:55.13]Dude.
[321:57.17]Gas.
[321:58.19]Three gases.
[321:59.20]What, it's August?
[321:59.84]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[322:13.98]Store everything.
[322:15.90]It's August.
[322:21.06]Okay, here we go.
[322:21.92]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[322:27.37]So now... This is almost sucked up.
[322:33.33]Two super silos.
[322:34.37]I got... One, two, three gases.
[322:44.83]You're gonna fuck it up?
[322:45.43]Alright, let's fucking go.
[322:59.65]You ready?
[323:01.11]I got two months to do this.
[323:02.50]I got two super silos full of fucking stuff.
[323:06.58]Alright, it's November.
[323:07.34]Here we go.
[323:08.70]Um, pause it.
[323:11.81]So, this is going this way.
[323:13.33]It sucks up here.
[323:14.47]Just close this.
[323:16.55]This one's gonna go this way.
[323:18.05]Just close this.
[323:21.33]Fuck it.
[323:21.65]Whatever.
[323:22.21]Who cares?
[323:22.63]This is gonna come up here.
[323:26.41]I think this is correct.
[323:32.30]Just close the rig.
[323:33.32]Don't do anything else.
[323:34.60]Just close the top and yolo it.
[323:37.28]Just close the rig.
[323:38.08]Just close the rig.
[323:38.62]Don't do anything else.
[323:41.49]Just close this.
[323:44.73]All you have to do is close the rig.
[323:46.73]That's it.
[323:47.05]Oh my god.
[324:25.01]Clean 50k.
[324:27.37]That's a clean 50k right there.
[324:32.31]Oh, that feels good.
[324:33.07]I'm good to go.
[324:36.67]I don't think there's any more oil.
[324:37.47]Actually, there might be one right here.
[324:43.77]But I'll take 50,000.
[324:44.17]I don't care.
[324:44.51]Oh.
[324:57.59]Alright.
[324:59.25]I'm way ahead now.
[325:05.87]Bank's gonna be looking to me to get loaned some money.
[325:08.52]Alright.
[325:18.44]I was a little more efficient this year.
[325:21.60]My pipes were not $38,000.
[325:22.38]They were just $3,800.
[325:30.69]Our mole expenses, obviously, are pretty good.
[325:40.03]Sounds good.
[325:45.95]3%.
[325:46.95]Not unless it comes way down here.
[325:49.50]I'm pretty far ahead.
[325:53.10]Ricardo's the only one that I'm worried about.
[325:54.52]I might just snipe it from him.
[326:00.53]If it goes underneath 20.
[326:08.15]That's 3% more.
[326:10.99]About 21%.
[326:12.00]Alright, I'm 10% higher than Ricardo.
[326:14.46]That's all I care about.
[326:18.30]Should I finish some of this stuff?
[326:19.90]Hold on.
[326:23.08]Longer timer.
[326:23.94]I think I need it, but what else can I do?
[326:29.49]Oh, 79 cents.
[326:30.03]Eh.
[326:30.15]He's never going to do scanner.
[326:41.84]Expense too expensive.
[326:45.28]I'm going to hold on to the money.
[327:15.94]Right here or right here?
[327:18.44]Everyone's gonna go for right here.
[327:19.96]Going this way.
[327:27.15]Dickhead.
[327:28.15]Um... Right here.
[327:33.47]Alright.
[327:39.74]Thanks to the timer upgrade, rigs will now take longer before they spill over.
[327:43.52]Good.
[327:57.51]Right side's looking pretty juicy.
[328:07.79]There's nothing over on the left side.
[328:09.77]Nothing.
[328:11.37]That's good for me, I guess.
[328:30.00]Gas are already right there.
[328:40.04]Hold off.
[328:51.56]Mega silo going to go over here.
[328:56.23]Store it for now.
[329:03.57]I need more horses.
[329:04.27]Jeez, 134.
[329:10.62]Are you kidding me?
[329:11.22]What's going on here?
[329:11.82]What's going on with these prices?
[329:13.98]Jesus.
[329:29.18]Is there really nothing over on the left side?
[329:34.06]Okay, this one's something right there.
[329:48.11]Alright, silo time.
[329:54.29]85 cents over there.
[330:05.21]Sell.
[330:16.24]That's a lot of money.
[330:16.90]Start the storage process.
[330:18.78]Left side.
[330:19.44]Yeah.
[330:20.00]Sell it on the left side.
[330:20.76]Why not?
[330:27.65]Okay.
[330:27.91]I got 11 grand.
[330:29.61]Start storing.
[330:35.49]Two Omega silos.
[330:39.61]I'm happy with that.
[330:40.21]Hit the right side.
[330:51.52]Okay, fine.
[330:55.54]It's a sure thing.
[331:00.93]Alright, I need more...
[331:05.32]I'm out of juice here.
[331:08.85]I'm out of juice.
[331:09.89]Where should I go?
[331:39.43]Gas.
[331:42.18]Three ga- I just blanked so hard.
[331:46.43]Okay, wait a minute.
[331:47.85]It's December.
[332:23.63]We're good.
[332:27.09]It's a little scary, but we're fine.
[332:28.13]21%.
[332:31.23]Alright, where was the last part?
[332:36.65]30% again.
[332:36.91]So wait, there's only, there's 100% of the shares are being sold.
[332:44.12]So let me take inventory here because I think I could, I could seal the win, couldn't I?
[332:53.26]With a certain percentage?
[332:54.04]It's alright, Ricardo got it.
[333:00.30]21... When is it mathematically not possible for either one of these to win?
[333:07.12]I just have to get to 51.
[333:07.84]Oh.
[333:11.19]What if I can't get to 51?
[333:11.85]20, 30... 31, 35...
[333:21.60]So 42% of the shares are out right now.
[333:25.17]Do you land before stock?
[333:30.44]Why?
[333:32.58]You need a majority or a plurality?
[333:47.54]They have, it's less money each.
[333:49.86]Really?
[333:50.48]Okay, I didn't know that.
[333:51.32]Interesting.
[333:54.88]Alright, what do you got?
[333:58.41]80 cents, left ink.
[333:59.37]I think it's worth it.
[334:05.95]More horses.
[334:12.17]Timer 3, no.
[334:13.31]Okay, so I have more horses now.
[334:16.83]Alright, there's only two more rounds in this, then we're at the home stretch.
[334:24.68]You know what?
[334:25.08]I'm gonna... Yeah, I'm bidding you on here.
[334:29.89]That's 38.
[334:30.09]This might be 40.
[334:30.71]Yeah, this is mine.
[334:46.87]Fuck all of you.
[334:47.91]It's fine.
[334:48.23]There's nothing in there.
[334:48.95]You're gonna find an old shoe.
[335:01.90]25 wagons.
[335:12.14]Left side was the one that's gonna be good for what we're trying to do, right?
[335:19.22]Left side is can't go under a certain amount.
[335:21.84]Diamond.
[335:22.14]I don't want to see more.
[335:25.84]Big one over there.
[335:44.52]Alright, let's just get some money.
[335:53.78]Come on, man.
[335:56.32]Hurry up.
[335:57.12]150.
[335:57.76]Come on.
[336:20.80]You're killing me here.
[336:22.84]Thank you.
[336:25.80]Don't shut that valve off.
[336:31.86]Okay.
[336:32.20]Nothing.
[336:42.03]Should I get some more moles?
[336:51.47]Yeah.
[337:01.71]Gas.
[337:03.95]Good, OK.
[337:06.49]I can do a double gas on the left, which would be awesome.
[337:27.01]Really?
[337:28.07]Shit.
[337:46.61]I mean, it was crazy what I just did, but whatever.
[337:49.52]August.
[337:49.82]Alright, we're good.
[337:52.88]Not enough oil to really do a silo.
[337:56.84]I might just do gas now.
[338:06.85]I'm doing gas now.
[338:15.38]September, man, September already.
[338:27.34]I'm doing gas now.
[338:28.20]Let's go.
[338:28.54]Oh, whatever.
[338:42.20]There's a rock here.
[338:42.80]That's fine.
[338:51.98]I can do it again.
[339:00.31]Not bad considering.
[339:01.55]I'll be honest.
[339:02.33]Not bad considering.
[339:03.83]Is there any more oil?
[339:13.52]There is down here.
[339:14.22]I want the thousand bucks.
[339:18.18]One little spot left, but I got the thousand.
[339:24.12]11 and a half hours, damn.
[339:25.28]This is what, almost the second longest stream ever?
[339:29.78]Getting there.
[339:35.64]Okay, land auction first.
[339:42.66]Um, this is the last one here.
[339:43.86]Did Ricardo literally have like no money there?
[339:52.50]I'll go here.
[339:57.85]Fine.
[339:58.27]I'll take the terrible one.
[339:59.37]That's okay.
[340:05.17]2% 40.
[340:05.41]Alright.
[340:06.05]Ricardo has... Ricardo's broke.
[340:08.71]Can I buy him out?
[340:12.81]Okay.
[340:13.43]If Blanche buys this, I don't care.
[340:15.63]It's nothing.
[340:18.62]But if it does go below 10 grand, I'm sniping it because Ricardo's going to try to get it.
[340:22.62]I'll go for a snipe.
[340:32.39]Sorry.
[340:32.99]Blanche, you have 2%.
[340:34.33]Congratulations.
[340:35.03]I'm saving money.
[340:44.74]There's no reason to do anything crazy.
[340:46.30]This is one of the shittiest plots.
[341:04.01]Not bad gas placement.
[341:10.08]Oops, made a lump.
[341:31.27]This one's going to have nothing in it.
[341:32.38]It's fine.
[341:40.28]Okay.
[341:47.27]Gas right here.
[341:48.05]This might be gas over here, too.
[341:53.27]I don't really care, though.
[341:55.39]Nice.
[341:56.05]Alright, that was a good find.
[342:16.66]nope alright horses are good make some money for a little bit if I leave here with 10 grand I'm fine
[342:49.12]Okay, now.
[342:50.00]Get some mole action here.
[342:52.78]Looking good.
[343:05.89]Why, you, why?
[343:07.83]Looking good.
[343:18.50]I got three gases here.
[343:19.70]OK, three gases.
[343:23.62]Sell a little bit.
[343:31.41]Sell a little bit.
[343:40.86]September, it's almost time to activate the gas.
[343:56.55]Build a silo up for another month.
[344:10.04]Alright, I want one full silo.
[344:13.36]And then I'm just grabbing gas.
[344:14.30]I'm going to grab gas everywhere.
[344:17.30]Okay, here we go.
[344:17.75]Let's just do it.
[344:28.72]Don't go yet.
[344:46.50]Don't go yet.
[345:02.35]Pretty good.
[345:03.23]Pretty good for... Pretty good considering.
[345:06.06]Pretty good considering.
[345:09.06]Oh my god, that was a huge one.
[345:10.38]I didn't see it.
[345:10.82]Whatever.
[345:11.70]Pretty good considering.
[345:14.88]What did I say?
[345:15.18]I wanted 10 grand from that?
[345:15.94]That'll be fine?
[345:19.20]I would be totally happy with 10 grand.
[345:24.09]My factory has new equipment on offer to increase the size of gas pockets.
[345:28.37]What?
[345:30.90]Winter is coming, we're moving to the snow area.
[345:33.18]It has smaller gas pockets, but there's a way to make them bigger.
[345:35.77]Alright, this is it.
[345:46.48]I'm ready.
[345:58.61]75 cents, 86 cents on the right side.
[346:04.62]That's good.
[346:05.26]I'm going to take it.
[346:05.90]We're going to get the best plot in the game.
[346:11.74]So I got to be prepared for this thermal.
[346:20.77]Activate all joints in a pipeline that encircles gas.
[346:23.67]This will cause the gas to expand.
[346:36.55]I don't know if we're going to do that.
[346:39.85]Drilling faster?
[346:40.97]Yeah, that's huge.
[346:42.87]Drill faster.
[346:43.83]It takes so goddamn long.
[346:46.11]I might take a loan out for this.
[346:47.13]Alright, well apparently this is it.
[346:59.29]This is probably one of the best ones.
[347:04.62]2%.
[347:04.66]Just go all in on the first run.
[347:10.98]That's the plan.
[347:28.21]Daisy, really?
[347:29.09]I was waiting for it to get there.
[347:30.13]Whatever.
[347:36.66]Let's do it.
[347:37.49]I gotta go all in.
[347:44.51]Okay.
[347:47.77]This is apparently one of the best plots in the entire video game, so I gotta get this right.
[347:57.82]Holy shit, look at that right side.
[348:00.00]What side is never gonna go under, um, which one is it?
[348:02.62]Right side?
[348:03.08]That's awesome if that's true.
[348:15.21]Right side?
[348:15.87]Perfect.
[348:36.35]Look at how big this is.
[348:37.39]I gotta go double here.
[348:45.64]um class should I connect these just connect them where's that bad idea no just go right in I'm just gonna go right in I could run I could absolutely run away with it
[349:15.75]No, forget about the right side.
[349:16.73]The left side, I mean.
[349:40.48]Okay.
[349:43.22]Alright.
[349:55.96]I don't see any gas.
[349:56.76]Got a little bit of gas here.
[350:06.35]Already at 16k and it's June.
[350:59.67]Start storing.
[351:02.39]It's only July.
[351:02.93]We're good.
[351:15.37]It's August.
[351:16.13]It's August.
[351:17.19]Oh, we're filled.
[351:17.77]Okay, gas time.
[351:18.65]Gas on the right side.
[351:20.67]Or left side.
[351:21.15]It doesn't matter.
[351:21.61]Hold on.
[351:37.13]What side?
[351:39.19]Right side, I think?
[351:46.54]Shit.
[351:47.12]What side?
[351:47.58]What do I do?
[351:48.26]What side?
[351:48.92]I'm gonna go.
[351:49.52]Alright.
[351:49.78]I have no way to put anything!
[352:07.69]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[352:08.81]Slow down, slow down.
[352:12.45]Um, okay, so... 38 cents!
[352:24.46]Not doing that yet.
[353:58.09]You can't be serious.
[353:59.39]It's fine.
[353:59.85]Look at this.
[354:02.86]I'm untouchable right now.
[354:06.32]I have almost 100k.
[354:09.78]And... Another diamond.
[354:12.19]We're doing that again.
[354:12.73]81 cents on left.
[354:14.61]You think it's worth it?
[354:16.87]Yeah.
[354:17.77]Anything over 80 I think is worth it.
[354:31.34]That's mine.
[354:32.38]I'm willing to pay at least 10 grand for this.
[354:35.29]Sorry, Daisy.
[354:43.97]Thank you.
[354:50.19]Everyone's broke.
[354:51.91]Look at how broke everybody is.
[354:52.81]4%.
[354:52.83]I can just sit here and wait.
[355:00.13]Alright, I think I'm comfortable taking 4% when this goes to 20k, just to seal it.
[355:08.96]Right before 20k.
[355:09.40]25%.
[355:09.44]And... Grilling speed...
[355:30.53]I can do drilling speed.
[355:31.73]I could do... Finally get the scanner.
[355:35.49]Alright, I got the scanner.
[355:41.71]I'm gonna upgrade this scanner's size.
[355:44.73]Twice.
[355:46.77]This thing better be worth it.
[356:08.19]Try our new scanner.
[356:09.11]Click the scanner icon.
[356:12.33]Point your mouse cursor in the ground.
[356:13.91]Wait until the size is right and then click the reveal area.
[356:20.67]What side do I want to be on?
[356:21.67]Left?
[356:29.95]What happened?
[356:30.57]I just... Oh, okay.
[356:34.62]Left side, right?
[356:52.27]Are you kidding me?
[357:07.52]It's only a hundred bucks to start that!
[357:33.88]Alright, I got more horses.
[357:34.92]It's going to start to overflow a little flow here.
[357:36.97]No, guys.
[357:52.78]Okay, I'm good.
[358:08.20]Start some storage here.
[358:09.14]Okay.
[358:22.20]Right side?
[358:22.84]No!
[358:33.58]Oh my god, this thing is fucking crazy.
[358:37.44]There's no gas in this level.
[358:43.61]Why did I buy those upgrades?
[358:44.77]What was the point of that?
[359:11.75]Zell!
[359:12.13]Before that goes down.
[359:41.84]Does rock, uh, crush?
[360:10.49]Door, door, door, door, door, door, door, door, door.
[360:18.70]The scanner is broken.
[360:20.60]It's so good.
[360:25.11]Gas.
[360:25.71]Alright.
[360:26.21]What about down here?
[360:26.67]Alright.
[360:32.69]We got double gas down here.
[360:35.53]I need another Omega silo and then we're going to get ready for the, uh, December.
[360:40.38]Okay.
[360:43.01]Don't sell anything.
[360:44.11]Store only.
[360:44.85]Forever.
[361:07.57]Here's one.
[361:08.07]We're gonna go wham wham.
[361:16.50]And go to bed.
[361:17.34]I'll go to bed when I break my streaming world record.
[361:27.22]This is it over here.
[361:28.00]Alright, this is it.
[361:28.56]I gotta focus on here.
[361:33.56]There's three gases.
[361:34.60]There's one, two, three.
[361:42.04]Alright, prepare.
[361:53.76]September.
[362:01.61]Don't drop down to 20 cents.
[362:05.63]Oh my god, what a disaster.
[362:09.77]I can ride this out till November.
[362:20.17]Here we go.
[362:52.25]Was that $75,000?
[362:57.75]$65,000.
[362:57.83]Oh, I didn't get it all.
[363:02.17]Shit.
[363:02.39]Oops.
[363:04.65]I forgot it was closed.
[363:05.59]It's alright.
[363:06.23]I'll take $63,000.
[363:06.79]What am I?
[363:07.63]Over $100,000?
[363:14.38]I'm on track to beat the game.
[363:15.42]For sure.
[363:15.98]Do I have any more diamonds?
[363:21.78]Alright, yeah, I'm 73.
[363:29.95]Everybody wants this one.
[363:32.01]Do you think this one here, which one down here?
[363:38.27]I'm going to save this one.
[363:38.99]This is probably safe.
[363:44.63]Or this one here.
[363:47.21]Left up like this one.
[363:51.37]Right of 73.
[363:51.79]Like up here?
[363:56.69]That's close to 34, though.
[363:57.93]That could be scary.
[364:00.61]That could actually be scary.
[364:02.91]Oh, my elbow!
[364:06.33]What is that?! !
[364:11.42]Oh, it's resting.
[364:12.84]Oh, it's because I'm resting.
[364:14.12]It's fine.
[364:14.58]I'm fine.
[364:14.86]It doesn't hurt.
[364:15.40]It's fine.
[364:16.16]It's a rash.
[364:18.32]It's from sitting leaning for an entire episode of this game.
[364:21.87]I'm alright.
[364:28.29]I'm scared to go to the top right.
[364:29.67]Oh, because you can't see.
[364:32.29]There's a 34 right here.
[364:35.47]That's scary.
[364:38.90]I think I'm going to go right here.
[364:43.33]Everyone wants the top ship.
[364:44.42]That's fine.
[364:45.58]I'll be fine with 60.
[364:46.14]I'm way ahead.
[364:52.16]Uh, herd size.
[364:53.14]40 horses?
[364:54.14]I don't think I need that.
[365:00.56]Oh, yes.
[365:01.58]Right ink.
[365:02.83]98 cents.
[365:03.27]Can't go below it.
[365:04.19]Perfect.
[365:07.51]Alright, 64k.
[365:07.81]This is for 6%.
[365:08.37]I gotta buy this.
[365:14.34]Alright, 6%.
[365:15.06]I'm gonna pull the trigger right now.
[365:26.36]I need... I'm gonna do it.
[365:28.30]I'm at 31.
[365:28.52]I have tons of money.
[365:31.42]I'm at 31%.
[365:34.44]I cannot risk anybody else getting that, especially you.
[365:38.14]Because you'd be at 16%.
[365:45.18]Alright, I'm good now.
[365:45.90]Let's go.
[365:49.10]You look tired.
[365:50.38]Um, I would, I mean, I'm a little, a little drained.
[365:53.45]I'm fine though.
[365:55.01]I wouldn't say I'm tired.
[365:59.53]Okay, let's make sure I don't blow this.
[366:01.95]Uh, right side.
[366:08.12]Not great.
[366:09.22]Not great.
[366:09.90]Let's get some moles.
[366:20.77]Okay, we're going to go right.
[366:21.54]There's a lot in the middle.
[366:22.54]Alright, we're going to go right here and I'm going to go wham, wham, wham.
[366:28.52]Start getting some cash, please.
[366:55.10]Come on.
[366:58.84]Come on.
[367:13.72]Okay, that's good.
[367:14.54]Let's upgrade.
[367:16.40]Ready?
[367:16.62]Getting on the horse.
[367:18.58]Staying on the right side.
[367:19.24]I don't care about left.
[367:27.94]It's going to start to get funky here.
[367:29.18]Look at that money rolling in.
[367:53.13]Can't.
[367:59.35]good but I want to see it's all upgraded all the way alright now let's do scan over here look at the gas now wow alright holy shit
[369:06.19]Time for the big money.
[369:09.31]Time to begin storing.
[369:10.11]Alright, we're in August.
[369:14.98]Fill those tanks.
[369:15.68]September.
[369:31.19]Fill them up.
[369:35.80]Alright.
[369:37.22]Do I even do the gas?
[369:38.54]There's only one gas here.
[369:40.48]Is it really only one gas?
[369:59.21]It's alright.
[369:59.98]It might be one here.
[370:06.39]Shit.
[370:07.03]Wait.
[370:15.77]Son of a gun.
[370:17.13]Son of a gun!
[370:23.99]Who needs the gas?
[370:38.34]Alright, let's go!
[370:40.54]I have a gas.
[370:55.13]S-s-sell on the left side!
[370:56.81]Left side!
[370:58.47]Go to left side, all of you!
[371:02.96]Change it!
[371:04.44]Right side!
[371:05.84]Right side!
[371:17.31]We're good.
[371:21.87]40,000.
[371:22.13]I got everything.
[371:22.63]I got the bonuses.
[371:23.29]All of it.
[371:24.13]3k.
[371:27.39]Why not?
[371:30.83]At least you still got it all sold.
[371:32.05]Yeah.
[371:35.01]This is in the bag, by the way.
[371:35.99]There's no way I don't think I can lose.
[371:37.33]This is too weird for me.
[371:41.03]I don't think I even want it.
[371:55.78]Going over here.
[372:01.36]Do the super gas.
[372:04.20]Thermal could be mega OP.
[372:05.89]I'll try it.
[372:06.99]I'll try it.
[372:07.39]I just don't... I want to make sure I have enough money to not care.
[372:10.55]I have 80,000.
[372:10.75]I want to make sure I... I'm not going to buy anything.
[372:15.65]60k.
[372:24.49]No, that's too much.
[372:26.11]That's too much.
[372:28.27]84 on the right side.
[372:39.29]Sure.
[372:44.51]I'll do speed 3, though, because the drill can go so fast, I think.
[372:48.63]6%.
[372:48.65]Uh-oh.
[372:57.63]You're not going to spend literally your entire net worth on this.
[373:01.17]But you might.
[373:01.73]I'm almost there.
[373:12.38]Elbow?
[373:14.58]I'm telling you, it's also because the camera is set up a certain way.
[373:17.45]Stop playing Fart Simulator?
[373:35.76]Are you really saying this is an art simulator game?
[373:50.64]Start.
[373:56.35]Good start, Andy.
[373:57.05]There's gas down here.
[374:11.17]Jeremiah, I'm begging you.
[374:12.47]I don't know what you're begging me.
[374:13.49]What are you talking about?
[374:14.51]Alright, this is super drill now.
[374:41.75]I'm gonna use this thing, right?
[374:44.21]Let's go over here.
[374:50.53]I think that's gas.
[374:58.72]Very nice.
[374:59.58]Very nice.
[375:21.60]one of these things here and connect it, or is there any reason to do that?
[375:25.53]Should I put one, like, another one and connect it here?
[375:28.33]Would it pump faster?
[375:29.13]Or no?
[375:34.91]Nah.
[375:35.83]Yes.
[375:37.11]Left.
[375:37.67]No, I don't care about left.
[375:39.59]No, we're good.
[375:39.99]We're good.
[375:54.01]120?
[375:54.03]I don't know, I don't care
[376:46.55]Oh yeah.
[376:49.63]It's August, we're good.
[377:09.36]What?
[377:10.34]Let's go this way.
[377:24.10]Alright, let's go.
[377:24.80]Why is he sweating so much?
[377:29.03]I've been sitting in the same chair for 12 hours, dude.
[377:33.61]No, my hair just went down.
[377:34.95]You're fine.
[377:36.71]I'm fine.
[377:37.09]You're going to be fine.
[377:45.74]November.
[377:50.38]I'm not gonna kill that.
[377:53.14]That's not gonna happen.
[377:56.53]Bottleneck Billy.
[378:00.19]Um, I just need to... Whatever, where's the gas?
[378:03.38]Bottleneck Billy.
[378:20.29]I made it with 17k.
[378:23.95]Okay, so that's not efficient.
[378:25.97]It's fine.
[378:26.43]I got money.
[378:26.93]Uh-oh.
[378:37.44]Oh.
[378:48.18]8k for this?
[378:49.71]God, dude.
[378:50.67]10k?
[378:53.65]Okay.
[379:06.92]She's smart.
[379:07.40]I'm going up here.
[379:08.02]This is going to be like probably 50.
[379:13.62]Alright.
[379:15.77]I have to make sure I... This is for 4%.
[379:19.26]Okay.
[379:19.94]Do it now.
[379:21.58]Spend all your money.
[379:26.30]You can afford it.
[379:26.84]Buy it right now.
[379:30.85]You can afford it.
[379:31.37]Buy it.
[379:31.59]Yeah, good.
[379:32.63]$27,000.
[379:37.07]I have 37%.
[379:37.37]You'll never match my share count.
[379:47.12]That's fine.
[379:50.72]By the way, don't ever forget who, uh, vetoed the diet soda machine.
[379:54.94]This guy.
[380:00.04]Oh, you voted for that?
[380:01.50]Oh, yeah, we're gonna have a diet soda machine.
[380:03.37]We're gonna have a diet... No.
[380:04.41]I put my 3,700,000 shares.
[380:05.09]I vetoed that.
[380:05.73]12-hour Andy?
[380:06.19]Yep.
[380:31.67]What a whiff.
[380:32.73]Alright.
[380:34.50]I see gas right there.
[380:35.46]Leave me alone.
[380:39.88]I'll pay it back.
[380:40.52]It's so easy to pay back.
[380:41.94]I'm not going to be a bottleneck berry.
[381:31.47]Shut up.
[381:32.44]Pow.
[381:50.53]Okay.
[381:50.85]Fill up that silo.
[381:52.01]Now.
[381:53.95]Canning.
[382:19.29]Oh, there's no more.
[383:20.68]Start filling it up.
[383:32.12]Nothing, really?
[383:34.98]This one sucks.
[383:38.52]Not even worth getting that fucking gas.
[383:39.80]Look at that.
[383:40.20]Not even worth it.
[383:40.74]I'm just going to sell, man.
[383:42.08]It's not worth it.
[383:45.88]There's nothing else.
[383:51.97]Unless there's something right here.
[383:54.23]Then I gotta start selling.
[383:57.17]What a terrible map.
[383:58.65]What?
[383:58.87]Alright, just store until I get a good return potential here.
[384:06.60]Left side looking pretty good.
[384:10.20]Everybody go, left side.
[384:17.12]Good.
[384:17.80]Very good.
[384:18.76]Very good.
[384:19.72]Very good.
[384:20.18]Now I'm gonna end early.
[384:24.98]Look at how shitty this was.
[384:35.36]Falling off.
[384:35.86]Show me where a good one is.
[384:56.57]Yeah, no shit it's gonna be that one.
[384:58.93]Why did I give this guy a diamond?
[385:05.39]Where's the most money?
[385:11.90]Somebody outbid me on that.
[385:12.80]Somebody outbid me on that.
[385:15.74]Oh my god, you idiot.
[385:16.84]$12,000.
[385:18.00]I'm just gonna go steal this from you.
[385:29.08]I think... Everyone's snoozing on the left side.
[385:31.64]57, 65, 59.
[385:32.30]Are you kidding me?
[385:37.05]I just screwed you.
[385:38.45]You just got screwed.
[385:40.83]Let's go.
[385:43.43]8%.
[385:46.19]I gotta lock it in.
[385:47.65]I gotta lock it in right now.
[385:49.50]I'm gonna lock it in right now.
[385:50.56]1, 2, 3.
[385:51.06]I'm gonna lock it in right now. 45%.
[385:59.36]I'm almost the mayor of the city.
[386:02.20]It's gonna be close.
[386:07.26]And this is probably a really good spot.
[386:09.70]Let's go.
[386:12.66]Five more percent and I win.
[386:26.19]Oh boy, that's bad.
[386:26.97]It's actually really terrible.
[386:29.15]I'm going to take a loan out.
[386:30.99]Okay, this is not bad.
[386:41.85]Let's get some gophers.
[386:50.80]It's all in the middle.
[386:52.00]We're going to stay on the left side.
[386:52.96]It's all in the middle.
[386:53.88]It's alright here.
[387:20.98]Go somewhere with it.
[387:21.69]I just sounded so angry.
[388:03.65]We're going straight down from here.
[388:04.67]How do I cancel that?
[388:06.45]Cancel! Cancel! Cancel! Cancel! Cancel!
[388:27.45]That's not serious? It is, cause I don't want to lose the game.
[388:31.45]I'm about to beat the game.
[389:32.25]Bottleneck Billy?
[389:33.03]It's not that bad, is it?
[390:12.94]Alright, fill it up.
[390:56.64]already gone it's already worse oh my fucking god I didn't I didn't even pay attention
[391:24.37]I think that's it.
[391:25.07]I think all the resources are gone.
[391:26.09]I have to drain this.
[391:30.73]Drain it, drain it, DRAIN IT ALREADY!
[391:31.96]Alright, are we at zero?
[391:38.66]All the resources are gone, right?
[391:40.56]Oh, fuck.
[391:41.96]Ew.
[392:21.72]He told me about that spot.
[392:22.94]It's my secret place.
[392:24.16]I win the game if I do this.
[392:55.23]Uh-oh.
[392:58.82]I have to make some money.
[393:01.70]Could I have just taken out a loan of, like, 50 grand and just been the mayor?
[393:09.37]Oh, shit.
[393:09.91]This is really bad.
[393:10.73]Alright.
[393:11.63]This better... Hopefully, chat was right.
[393:16.97]I'm not gonna blow, like, two grand with the scanner.
[393:24.01]Seems pretty promising so far, right in the middle here.
[393:40.90]Seems pretty promising right off the bat.
[393:42.38]Two big ones.
[393:45.02]And a gas right there.
[393:59.19]Let's do this.
[394:27.37]Don't overflow.
[394:28.53]Not on me now.
[394:29.15]Okay.
[394:47.52]Door.
[394:47.70]Scan.
[394:57.20]I'll take the diamond.
[394:59.42]Alright, this is alright.
[395:00.22]I'm just gonna go down from here.
[395:04.62]Keep this one running.
[395:20.63]Whole lot of nothing.
[395:27.08]I need some money.
[395:37.45]Alright, 11 grand.
[395:39.43]Actually, everyone keep selling because I need the cash bad.
[395:56.67]Place is dry, guys.
[396:00.61]Place is dry, man.
[396:04.73]Place is dry.
[396:17.54]Guys, place is dry.
[396:18.10]Right, right.
[396:19.46]What do you mean right?
[396:20.30]This place is dry, man.
[396:25.96]Ain't nothing here.
[396:26.54]Sell right.
[396:30.02]There's nothing else to sell.
[396:30.86]I don't have any.
[396:31.50]There's nothing else.
[396:33.84]Sell right.
[396:35.22]The oil is gone.
[396:51.77]This place was junk.
[397:07.61]I got 40k.
[397:10.69]Alright.
[397:11.67]I am in a position to get that.
[397:14.05]Hold on.
[397:20.07]71 cents on left side.
[397:21.15]Not enough.
[397:22.37]80 cents on right side.
[397:23.77]No.
[397:31.85]This is... Really?
[397:32.55]Okay.
[397:33.59]They're gonna think I'm stupid.
[397:45.05]That's fine.
[397:47.67]I got 34k.
[397:48.63]4%.
[397:50.37]Alright.
[398:09.20]I fucked up.
[398:13.00]I clicked a little too late.
[398:26.26]The Patriots just got like three safeties in a row.
[398:30.04]That was that reaction.
[398:33.09]Like Tom Brady fumbled the ball 15 times in the first quarter.
[398:37.75]That's like what that is.
[398:39.05]That's what I just did.
[398:43.45]Alright.
[398:45.42]No scanning.
[398:46.68]No scanning.
[398:48.28]This might be a good one.
[398:51.46]We're doing gophers.
[398:59.79]It's gonna be the big one.
[399:01.51]I see gas over here.
[399:05.43]I'll take a loan.
[399:05.97]I don't fucking care.
[399:07.23]No.
[399:18.30]I don't want to go in there yet.
[399:19.44]I don't know.
[399:19.94]Okay.
[399:25.69]So, of course.
[399:32.34]This one sucks.
[399:33.32]I know it does.
[399:33.86]This one sucks.
[399:49.46]There's gonna be two or three little dumps.
[399:51.87]And that's it.
[400:15.21]Start storing.
[400:15.75]Alright, I need to make a move here.
[400:17.93]Scan.
[400:20.04]Is there anything down here that I can get?
[400:21.98]Over here?
[400:22.34]Oh my god.
[400:27.54]Look at all this gas, but this place sucks.
[400:39.86]It's already June.
[400:40.72]I don't have shit.
[400:43.44]There's three gases, though.
[400:54.63]Oh my God, this place is ass.
[401:30.51]This place is ass.
[401:43.45]Just store.
[401:45.21]There's no reason to do this right now.
[401:46.31]Just store and wait for the big thing at the end.
[401:47.93]This place is absolute ass.
[401:58.87]Fill up this silo.
[402:25.42]Look at how terrible- I bet you this is 15.
[402:29.30]It's probably 10.
[402:29.78]This shit's probably 5.
[402:33.42]It's gonna be the lowest of the whole game.
[402:35.82]I should've just bid another 5 grand and taken it from that guy.
[402:39.82]That might have lost me the game.
[402:42.68]That may have just lost me the whole game.
[402:44.96]Alright.
[402:45.82]Let's go.
[402:46.39]Here we go.
[402:47.55]This way.
[402:52.63]It's time to open up the gas.
[403:17.92]What are you talking about?
[403:19.10]It's 21 still bad
[403:41.73]I have to win this auction.
[403:43.19]Whatever it is.
[403:49.05]I need 5%.
[403:49.31]Okay.
[403:49.75]I'm just kidding.
[403:58.26]I won the game.
[403:59.00]I won the game.
[403:59.44]I just won the game.
[404:01.80]I'm at 50%.
[404:02.26]I own the company.
[404:03.48]I own the company.
[404:04.24]You're fired.
[404:05.28]You're fired.
[404:06.18]You're fired.
[404:07.18]You're all fired.
[404:08.24]And by the way, I'm taking a vacation.
[404:11.91]I win 50 it's 51 no it's not he said 50. what are you talking about
[404:39.19]This could be a good one.
[404:41.07]Oh yeah.
[404:43.91]Oh yeah, this is a big one.
[404:45.49]Let's go double here.
[404:46.33]Oh shit.
[405:48.20]This is gonna be the big one.
[405:49.24]I know it.
[405:49.79]There's two huge veins right here.
[405:54.17]Left?
[405:54.83]I see light.
[406:01.90]A meteor just hit the Earth.
[406:04.02]There's nothing even over here.
[406:06.50]Really?
[406:08.97]What the fuck?
[406:37.93]nothing I think this actually might be it oh there's a little one down there dude it's empty forget about the gas I just need over like 30k or 20k and I win the game
[407:24.41]30k?
[407:24.93]I'll take it.
[407:27.77]Unless there's something over here.
[407:28.65]Oh, no way.
[407:34.50]30k is enough for me.
[407:40.50]That's fine.
[407:43.90]Let's just check.
[407:44.44]It's only August.
[407:54.64]I don't think so.
[407:59.64]No, that's it.
[408:00.06]I'm out.
[408:04.20]Yeah.
[408:04.73]This is diamond right there.
[408:05.71]Alright, 25,000.
[408:08.53]That puts me at 28k.
[408:13.87]Do I not own the company yet?
[408:15.13]I only have two more rounds left.
[408:20.61]Do I- I don't own the company?
[408:55.49]What were you doing all game?
[408:56.61]Alright, I'm just gonna try to bank money.
[409:00.47]I'm gonna try to bank money.
[409:02.85]That's all that matters right at this very moment.
[409:04.40]Only two rounds.
[409:07.92]Okay.
[409:40.08]Diamond.
[409:56.82]Hurry up, get some selling.
[410:25.13]Alright.
[410:25.73]Store.
[410:36.65]Sell on the right side.
[410:37.58]I need a little bit of cash.
[410:41.36]Okay.
[410:42.98]Actually sell everything over there.
[410:44.38]Sell everything.
[410:44.82]Got a buck?
[410:49.88]Sell everything.
[410:55.58]Okay, hold off.
[410:56.42]I'm going to do double super silo over here.
[411:07.89]Junk.
[411:17.38]It was worth it.
[411:18.90]Don't tell me that wasn't worth it.
[411:21.48]It was.
[411:22.34]I think it's empty now.
[411:24.22]Let's check.
[411:51.48]I have 32 grand.
[411:52.00]This is the final round.
[411:57.74]This is it.
[411:58.32]I have to win this auction.
[412:04.05]Alright.
[412:06.91]I have to win this auction.
[412:11.91]She's gonna buy it.
[412:22.21]Oh my god, Blanche.
[412:23.99]Blanche!
[412:28.75]You... You're out of the game already.
[412:30.93]Don't do that.
[412:33.84]You're out of the game already.
[412:38.54]You don't land... Okay.
[412:40.70]I'm sorry.
[412:41.86]But, like, you landed on, like, Park Place in Monopoly.
[412:45.98]You have two random-ass properties.
[412:48.98]I have Boardwalk.
[412:51.00]And I also own Monopolies.
[412:53.51]I own three Monopolies.
[412:56.09]The other person over here, my friend over here, has three Monopolies.
[413:00.03]And you just took Park Place.
[413:02.87]And you just won't concede the game.
[413:04.31]And now you just, like, ruined it for me.
[413:06.73]I just got blocked.
[413:07.59]Yeah.
[413:08.17]I hate that.
[413:13.25]It's like, the three of us are playing.
[413:16.57]You have, like, 30 bucks after buying Park Place.
[413:38.08]No, don't throw.
[413:38.88]I can probably still win.
[413:40.56]There's probably one more auction.
[413:50.48]Drink some water, dude.
[413:51.16]I've drank like 150 ounces of water over the last 12 hours.
[413:56.75]Alright, this is dog shit.
[413:57.99]It's absolutely terrible.
[414:01.25]But I gotta make a little bit of cash.
[414:12.74]It's so bad.
[414:35.43]I'm just trying to make some at least a little bit of money.
[414:37.03]Check far right for oil.
[414:54.10]There is gas over here, but I don't think I can I'm not gonna be able to get enough I don't think
[415:39.73]I just figured out that you can go like this with the mouse scroll.
[415:43.43]I've been like... That might be actually... I don't care.
[416:22.50]Okay.
[417:28.53]gas 10 grand and I get the bonuses very nice alright 11 grand what does that put me at 41 what happened to um what happened to blanche
[417:56.59]Oh, yeah, right.
[417:58.26]Blanche, you... You bought Park Place.
[418:02.72]And then you, two or three turns later, got up to go to the bathroom and get a drink.
[418:11.24]And then started talking to somebody in the hallway at whatever family get-together we're at.
[418:17.85]And you never come back and sit down at the table.
[418:21.95]And then you sit on the couch and the TV is on.
[418:28.87]And then we just kind of say, let's stop playing, I guess.
[418:33.55]It's over.
[418:35.05]The game's over.
[418:35.65]It's a tie.
[418:38.61]+2 farming.
[418:39.37]You know it.
[418:41.60]Alright.
[418:41.90]So do I win?
[418:42.94]That was it, folks.
[418:46.54]I'm out of land.
[418:47.30]Now let's see who would become the new mayor.
[418:49.46]Did I actually not do it?
[418:53.89]There is no winner yet.
[418:55.87]This means the stockholder with the smallest share and the least money, in case of a draw, will have to go.
[419:02.25]So Blanche will have to pack up and leave, and we will auction off their 11% shares.
[419:09.81]Meet me at the stock auction to decide who gets the remaining 11% of the stock.
[419:18.75]Oh, I thought I was trying to take out like $100,000 alone.
[419:24.06]Hey.
[419:26.74]Oh, do you want it?
[419:30.14]Hey, Ricardo, do you want it?
[419:30.98]Hey, Ricardo, do you want it?
[419:33.17]Alright.
[419:34.91]Ricardo, do you want some shares?
[419:37.53]I'm the mayor.
[419:38.27]I win.
[419:42.05]Great job.
[419:42.53]You have secured more than half of the town's shares.
[419:46.68]You have won the campaign and you'll be the new mayor.
[419:49.98]I've got something special for you as a reward.
[419:51.54]Meet me at the town hall.
[419:58.73]What do you mean, land auction?
[419:59.93]What is this?
[420:01.54]I have a special present for you.
[420:02.88]See that island over there?
[420:07.72]It's yours to mine.
[420:14.85]We're done.
[420:15.51]Let's go back outside.
[420:16.93]Private island?
[420:21.27]Mine?
[420:23.40]Are you serious?
[420:27.95]Are you ready for your final challenge?
[422:15.75]Kylo.
[422:49.13]Oh!
[424:11.94]Oh my god!
[424:13.07]Hurry, hurry!
[424:47.36]I'm gonna break the counter.
[424:58.87]I can't count that high.
[425:20.27]I can't count this hive.
[425:26.83]Okay, hold on.
[425:35.78]I'm gonna break the counter.
[425:37.32]What?
[425:37.60]105?
[425:37.62]Did I win?
[425:38.22]Who cares? 110?
[425:51.67]I made $100,000.
[425:51.91]He's tripping.
[425:57.29]Congratulations, you've won the game.
[425:58.75]You can now play Turmoil on Expert Mode.
[426:01.29]Where the characters have special powers and the competition is tougher.
[426:05.24]Give it a try.
[426:05.98]Great job, you've worked like a horse.
[426:07.90]You get some horseshoes.
[426:10.50]Me and the moles are very happy for you.
[426:13.74]Ooh, party time.
[426:14.88]I'm sure you'll buy everyone around.
[426:17.70]Well done.
[426:18.39]I'm sure you'll make almost as good a mayor as me.
[426:21.94]Oh!
[426:22.06]Okay, that's interesting.
[426:22.78]Let's check it out.
[426:23.34]Oh...
[426:52.34]Not one million.
[426:54.22]So close.
[426:57.18]All these goddamn blockbuster late fees that screwed everything up.
[427:01.90]I would have had over a million.
[427:10.39]Sorry.
[427:12.43]Crafts not available.
[427:13.43]707,000 barrels sold.
[427:22.10]$761,000 earned.
[427:23.62]Average price of $1.08 per barrel.
[427:25.43]That's pretty good.
[427:26.31]$110 per barrel on the right.
[427:38.44]I think this is pretty good.
[427:39.66]That's actually pretty good.
[427:41.44]Right side.
[427:42.18]Oh, right Twix ended up winning.
[427:47.00]I went, that's funny.
[427:47.76]Not by very much though.
[427:50.00]What's the, oh this is total.
[427:58.39]You have streamed longer than the viewer count.
[428:01.25]That's funny.
[428:01.63]Alright, this is interesting.
[428:07.44]Poor dowsers.
[428:09.22]I didn't do, I didn't, okay after the tutorial zone.
[428:13.06]I didn't buy them ever again.
[428:16.52]What was the thing I spent the most money on besides pipes?
[428:21.14]Pipe upgrades?
[428:21.88]Pipes?
[428:22.20]I feel like I did that a little... A little less ideal than I could have.
[428:28.74]Rigs?
[428:30.54]Valve usage?
[428:31.92]Half of those were mistakes.
[428:35.98]Moles?
[428:36.38]I thought that would be more.
[428:39.88]I spent more money on moles than silos.
[428:41.60]That's kind of crazy.
[428:46.51]I spammed so many moles.
[428:48.87]Screenshot.
[428:52.21]Oh.
[428:53.23]Cool.
[428:56.17]What's the thing I spent the least on besides dowsers?
[429:03.96]Tier three silo upgrade.
[429:08.86]Valve usage.
[429:10.71]Pretty good.
[429:11.91]Cool.
[429:13.77]Really cool.
[429:14.39]That was awesome.
[429:15.99]That was such a fun game, and I think there's DLC.
[429:21.55]Maybe I'll play the DLC another time.
[429:23.83]Stream is not over yet.
[429:28.41]What's the countdown to beat the old record?
[429:30.88]13 and what?
[429:38.16]About a half an hour.
[429:39.84]Dude, I gotta beat the old record.
[429:47.63]What does the DLC even look like?
[429:50.15]How do I get there?
[429:50.85]Start new campaign.
[430:01.52]Okay.
[430:01.94]The heat is on.
[430:03.02]I just want to see.
[430:08.08]Lots of oil.
[430:08.70]New area.
[430:09.26]I just want to see.
[430:13.33]Welcome to my town.
[430:13.99]I'm the mayor here.
[430:14.73]Is this me?
[430:15.23]Is it me?
[430:17.86]What happened to me?
[430:21.68]Holy shit.
[430:25.23]Wow.
[430:26.11]Okay.
[430:28.95]Yeah, I just wanted to look.
[430:29.75]Start with 200 grand.
[430:35.03]That's a lot of content.
[430:35.81]That's cool.
[430:39.13]Yeah, we all start with like 200,000.
[430:40.74]Okay, yeah.
[430:41.32]No, I'm not doing that.
[430:47.02]Alright, what can we do for like 20, 30 minutes?
[430:50.44]That was a very, very enjoyable experience.
[430:55.51]What do we got here?
[430:59.69]No, I'm not doing tier lists.
[431:01.81]Not now.
[431:06.39]20 Minutes Till Dawn?
[431:08.54]Not a bad idea.
[431:10.06]Yeah, we'll go back to that.
[431:11.40]Although that's a little intense.
[431:17.97]Is that too intense?
[431:22.47]Hmm.
[431:31.56]Maybe not.
[431:32.84]I think I can just probably sit there with my mouth open.
[431:37.44]Let's try it.
[431:37.96]Let's see if I can do it.
[431:43.35]That was really cool, though.
[431:45.11]What a great game.
