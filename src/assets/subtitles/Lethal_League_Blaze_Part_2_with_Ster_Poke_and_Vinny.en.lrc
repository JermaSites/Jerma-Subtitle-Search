[06:12.65]Yeah, you can hit it up.
[06:13.57]You can, like, angle it, I remember.
[06:28.13]This game gets crazy.
[06:28.67]It's like Smash Baseball.
[06:33.15]It is dodgeball where you don't want to get hit by the ball.
[06:36.88]So when I swing and I hit the ball, if it touches you, you're dead.
[06:47.02]You can catch the ball and throw it.
[06:54.27]You can bunt it.
[06:54.99]You can do little goofy shit.
[07:01.96]I like goofy shit.
[07:03.04]I want to see what kind of goofy shit I can do.
[07:05.56]This is going to be crazy with four people, though.
[07:13.29]Poke just joined on me, so you just join me on Steam.
[07:15.74]Okay, cool.
[07:20.64]Also, the Mycopunk game, I'm probably going to check out sometime like weekend or next week.
[07:27.93]So I'll hit you guys up.
[07:29.22]I probably won't stream it.
[07:30.62]I'll just play it.
[07:32.06]But either, you know, that's another of your types of games.
[07:36.33]It looks fun.
[07:37.45]I was looking to stream it.
[07:38.67]Do you not want it streamed?
[07:39.91]Do you want to be like incognito?
[07:41.00]No, no, I'll stream.
[07:41.62]I'll record it if it's like a thing.
[07:47.89]What is that tweet?
[07:51.53]I don't know.

[08:15.71]It looks like him.

[10:43.46]I'm curious.
[10:44.54]Yeah, I think you and Jerma would like it too.
[10:46.50]It's a good game.
[10:47.10]I'll play it.
[10:48.28]It's a Steam game.
[10:49.24]It's really good.
[10:51.44]I'll see if I can get you guys some codes.
[10:53.31]I'll pull up my string.
[10:55.56]this is a free-for-all you guys are doing a free-for-all yeah actually free-for-all is probably good to start with that's fine it does look like a story game hold on I could unplug my I don't have enough usb slots for what I'm doing right now I'm an idiot alright I kind of want to play that guy
[11:21.75]Wait, so what's the teams?
[11:23.35]Is there any teams or we just are all free for alright now?
[11:27.19]Be on the lookout.
[11:27.94]Be careful.
[11:29.58]I'm going to put us in the training room.
[11:34.54]Up a random.
[11:35.75]I'm a random guy.
[11:36.99]Random is good.
[11:38.11]I don't even know what the game is yet, so.
[11:41.45]Are you ready?
[11:42.55]Oh, you're about to learn.
[11:45.58]That's the ball.
[11:46.64]You take damage.
[11:51.70]What is going on already?
[11:56.63]It's nuts.
[11:56.85]Why is it happening?
[11:57.27]People forget that this is my game.
[11:59.59]People forget that this is the one that I was good at.
[12:05.34]Okay, so on the bottom left, you see the release bar?
[12:09.02]When it's a long charge up, you'll see the release bar charge up and you can tell when to hit it.
[12:15.09]See, like, boom.
[12:16.33]I got so many cords on me.
[12:17.68]Hold on.
[12:18.30]Now.
[12:22.60]Are we on teams or is this free for all?
[12:24.46]Free for all.
[12:27.50]So the more you hit the ball, the faster the ball goes until it reaches like pause the game giga mode.
[12:32.93]And then you have to like jump in people's faces to parry them or start bunting it.
[12:45.99]What the heck?
[12:47.43]Special.
[12:48.75]Oh, fuck.
[12:51.73]Who caught it?
[12:52.19]Somebody caught it.
[12:54.99]Jeez.
[13:00.67]What?
[13:04.38]Don't even think about it.
[13:08.32]You're playing the alligator.
[13:09.30]This is my game.
[13:10.08]Yeah, you're playing the alligator.
[13:11.00]Then they could hold the ball forever in his mouth.
[13:12.79]Cheating character.
[13:13.67]S-tier character.
[13:14.37]Cheating character.
[13:15.25]S-tier character.
[13:16.21]Oh, wow.
[13:16.79]That killed me.
[13:17.99]Yeah, S-tier cheater character.
[13:19.55]I agree.
[13:20.33]Latch is OP.
[13:24.07]Alright, Candyman player.
[13:26.84]Candyman is annoying too, true.
[13:29.30]Damn it.
[13:32.26]Look at my aura.
[13:41.63]Someone said, I'm sorry, Vinny, but I think you're too old for this.
[13:44.23]Me and Jerma are the same age.
[13:49.02]Oh, come on.
[13:49.78]I tried to turn.
[13:50.48]Yeah, what do you mean we're too old for this?
[13:55.75]Ster is awesome at this.
[13:57.63]I was really good at this.
[13:59.35]He was really good at it.
[14:01.74]Ster is playing his favorite character.
[14:03.68]He has like 5,000 hours in this game just this last six months.
[14:09.49]Dude, the eating thing is weird.
[14:11.83]No, no, no.
[14:13.17]It's skill.
[14:13.89]It's skill.
[14:15.14]What the fuck?
[14:20.20]By the way, how dare you play Latch at game one with two new players?
[14:25.74]I'm not new.
[14:27.16]Wait, have you played this before?
[14:28.32]Yeah, I played in a tournament once.
[14:30.74]Wait, why did you quit?
[14:31.58]I think you have to join on me again.
[14:33.57]It said rematch or quit.
[14:35.21]And I thought rematch would be like the same characters in the same map.
[14:38.65]I don't know.
[14:39.11]Oh, what the heck?
[14:42.74]I rage quit.
[14:44.08]No.
[14:48.37]I rejoined.
[14:51.51]Because apparently I'm not allowed to play Latch.
[14:53.75]You can play whoever you want.
[14:54.59]Now that I've had one game, I'll be ready to go.
[14:58.66]Yeah, you'll be Reddit to go.
[15:02.56]I'm waiting for you.
[15:14.00]Everybody's a special move too and they do something a little different.

[16:10.80]It says waiting for player for me.
[16:12.30]I don't see Vinny.
[16:14.70]I don't think Ster's picked anything yet.

[17:42.81]I've been there.
[17:44.29]Criken with his pinched nerve from sleeping.
[17:47.78]He went to see a doctor and he had to wear a neck brace because he was sleeping.
[17:53.33]That's scary.
[17:54.25]It's fun.
[17:56.51]This is actually volleyball.
[18:00.98]Oh, yeah.
[18:01.40]You have to keep it off the ground.
[18:09.58]That's good.
[18:18.97]I get it now.
[18:19.65]I see.
[18:21.52]Oh, that was not the right move.
[18:23.34]Sorry.
[18:25.40]My team is throwing.
[18:27.48]Benny, you're doing good.
[18:34.59]It's a PS5 controller.
[18:36.73]I'm the number one.
[18:45.12]Up, up, up.
[18:46.52]How do you go up?
[18:48.41]Up, up, up.
[18:50.49]How do you go up?
[18:50.95]Big, big, big, big, up.
[18:53.25]Big.
[18:54.27]Where'd it go?
[18:55.71]I don't know.
[18:56.73]I don't know what happened.
[18:59.04]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[19:03.60]Now you've hit it to me?
[19:04.54]Up, up.
[19:10.05]Oh, God.
[19:12.05]That was actually pretty sick, Vinny.
[19:14.86]We can win by not moving.
[19:15.78]I feel like we can win by just not moving.
[19:22.48]Oh, hit it up.
[19:24.41]Shit.
[19:25.03]I'll get it.
[19:25.37]I'll get it.
[19:25.73]I promise.
[19:32.75]Alright.
[19:33.61]Hold on.
[19:34.68]Let me.
[19:35.06]Oh, my God, dude.
[19:35.92]What the fuck is happening?
[19:38.04]It's harder than it looks.
[19:41.16]Stop.
[19:45.42]Oh my God.
[19:46.38]I thought it was you.
[19:46.96]I thought it was you.
[19:47.64]Yeah, fuck.
[19:49.22]I think you just keep doing that.
[19:50.06]You'll win.
[19:54.93]I think it's actually harder with two people on a side of the team.
[19:58.49]Oh my.
[20:01.42]Does 10 mean you lose?
[20:11.19]Nice Jerm.
[20:13.51]No, why does it go down?
[20:14.57]Why does it go down?
[20:15.88]I think that was the parry sound, but I can't remember how that mechanic works.
[20:21.32]Oh, come on.
[20:22.03]That was a good stuff.
[20:25.33]That's GG.
[20:30.22]Oh.
[20:30.30]That kind of felt like... Like it really showed how bad everyone was.
[20:39.13]Wait, I was scoring not... That's what I was feeling.
[20:42.22]I need just a new character.
[20:43.36]I'm good now.
[20:43.90]We're going to be great.
[20:45.58]So volleyball or no?
[20:47.34]No volleyball.
[20:48.34]Let's do the teams.
[20:49.87]Okay.
[20:50.25]I think teams normally is the best way.
[20:52.05]You got to click your name to choose a team.
[20:57.41]Alright.
[20:57.91]Me and Vinny Green.
[20:59.54]Alright, Ster.
[21:01.02]Let's do it.
[21:02.68]I'll let you down.
[21:03.62]Ster, I like you well enough.
[21:06.30]Well, at least one of us do.
[21:09.44]Don't worry.
[21:10.30]I can handle him, okay?
[21:11.54]I can handle him, guys.
[21:12.72]Don't worry.
[21:14.40]Wait, the two pros on the same team?
[21:17.93]Well, we better not lose.
[21:19.71]What, me and Vinny?
[21:22.11]Mm-hmm.
[21:23.02]I've been gaming for 30 years, 35 years, 38 years.
[21:27.54]How do I set ready?
[21:28.54]Oh.
[21:28.96]You click on the set ready.
[21:30.69]What's your favorite game console?
[21:35.55]Super Nintendo.
[21:36.71]And you know why.
[21:37.44]N64.
[21:39.93]That's a good answer.
[21:40.89]Don't say PC.
[21:43.37]Minus PC, Star.
[21:44.61]Let's say you couldn't say.
[21:46.30]I hate you.
[21:46.76]Oh.
[21:56.21]You know what to do?
[21:57.03]Yep.
[21:58.69]Did you?
[21:58.97]Come on, Vinny.
[22:01.41]Oh.
[22:02.81]It's okay.
[22:13.22]Damn it!
[22:18.39]This is not a good colorblind map.
[22:19.51]I can't see anything.
[22:21.78]Oh my goodness!
[22:25.08]We just got eked out of here.
[22:27.83]Holy shit.
[22:47.23]That got heated.
[22:48.91]It's not my game.
[23:13.99]Cheats.
[23:14.65]Can you dance?
[23:16.19]I'm dead.
[23:28.52]Oh, here it comes.
[23:31.26]What button am I supposed to press when that happens?
[23:35.17]You could parry it with circle, knock it into the air.
[23:38.99]You could grab it with triangle.
[23:42.04]Best of three.
[23:45.72]I like this character.
[23:47.54]Best of three?

[25:06.28]No!
[25:13.01]Where is it?
[25:15.99]What?

[28:12.29]Still haven't had that.
[28:20.68]Yeah, you have.
[28:21.89]Most of the time you've killed it, you've pressed it.
[28:24.55]Really?
[28:26.49]Yeah.
[28:30.86]Alright, pull it back.
[28:32.52]Candyman's special is it goes through walls instead of bounces on them.
[28:38.78]No.
[28:41.15]I'm dead.
[28:41.69]I'm a dead guy.
[28:45.60]Vinny, it's just you.
[28:50.00]Why did my dude sit down?
[28:51.07]He just sat.
[28:55.39]I'm actually just out forever.
[28:56.64]I don't understand the health.
[28:59.54]oh shit you have stocks at the top like uh smash brothers wait how do I use the special oh you have to hit uh yeah after you hit it you press hit again
[29:29.56]Oof.

[29:39.65]I think I mixed us up.
[29:41.69]Yeah.
[29:41.99]Was that his special?
[29:43.99]I don't know what that was.
[29:45.12]I didn't even see the ball.
[29:47.52]Wow.
[29:47.92]I think I figured it out, guys.
[29:51.70]I've got this dead weight on my team.
[29:53.28]I'm sorry.
[29:54.42]I was alive more than you were.
[29:56.45]Wait, guys.
[29:57.17]Apparently...
[29:59.04]Hover over a Sonata, Raptor, Switch, Candyman, Raptor, Dice, and then latch for a secret character.
[30:08.13]Is that real or should I ban this guy?
[30:09.30]Let me see.
[30:10.54]You're going to get a secret?
[30:14.12]Oh, never mind.
[30:14.62]Only in challenge mode.
[30:15.91]Never mind.
[30:16.29]Go next.
[30:20.79]Are we doing teams again?
[30:21.51]Should we switch it up?

[31:53.02]Nice
[32:05.81]oh there we go oh in my face that's usually where it is
[32:33.77]What the hell did you just do?
[32:35.31]You did a combo in the air.
[32:42.78]Man.
[32:44.30]Oh.
[32:48.16]Damn.
[32:48.36]Damn.
[32:49.12]Yeah.
[32:50.68]I want to do that move again.
[32:54.01]I was looking at the meter too.
[32:55.13]I just didn't time it right.
[32:59.97]Oh, god damn it, dude.
[33:01.45]I thought I was going to throw it to the...
[33:03.79]oh we got destroyed Ster wow yeah they're stepping on us they nerfed latch in the last patch I think yeah they just nerfed latch like two seconds ago they saw you play him they were like nope emergency this is elder abuse should we all click random one time yeah sure alright random

[34:15.37]dude that was pretty good Ster that was pretty good teamwork I will say shit oh oh don't do it
[34:44.77]Get your own ball, man.
[34:48.57]Oh my god.
[34:53.52]Highest number.
[34:55.80]What the fuck?
[34:56.61]Why did it go so fast?
[35:00.53]Wait.
[35:03.58]I don't think I actually used my special.
[35:05.66]You guys go left, we go right next round.
[35:11.39]Ooh.
[35:20.16]Is there a mode for that?
[35:25.48]Oh!
[35:26.22]Shit.
[35:27.40]Come on, Ster, we gotta win one.
[35:28.82]No one hit it, no one hit it.
[35:30.02]Oh wait, I'm dead, never mind.
[35:33.61]I'm out.
[35:41.37]This game is like League of Legends.
[35:43.52]It's just like that.
[35:48.84]Uh-oh.
[35:57.74]Oh, man.
[35:59.08]What is that power?
[35:59.58]Didn't you just use it?
[36:07.97]What happened?
[36:11.91]I just undercut all of my goodwill from my chat.
[36:14.88]They were like, wow, he's so good.
[36:16.38]Never mind.
[36:18.48]You were doing so, so well, too.
[36:22.52]That was like exceptional work.
[36:25.21]Thanks, man.
[36:29.66]Uh, free-for-all for a bit?
[36:31.37]See what that's like?
[36:31.99]Yeah, let's do free-for-all.
[36:38.40]Rando free-for-all, or what do you guys think?
[36:41.59]Uh, just pick character, whatever.
[36:45.83]What is the robot's special?
[36:47.38]What does he do?
[36:47.80]He, like, flips the ball around, doesn't he?
[36:49.22]Does, like, a skateboard trick.
[36:51.68]Yeah, I can figure out what it does, though.
[36:54.52]I kind of forget what everyone does except for like latch and boombox girl Instant hit at a shallow angle And right on walls.
[37:10.50]Oh shit.
[37:10.94]Really?
[37:11.60]And again, how do you do your special?
[37:14.16]After you hit the ball, you instantly press the hit again.
[37:16.44]So you're kind of mashing the hit buttons.
[37:17.77]You're just getting naturally
[37:27.46]Wow, I got killed real real quick.
[37:31.29]Oh my god, it's What how is your so fast you're special that's what my guy does yeah, that's that's okay Oh, come on
[37:54.48]Turns out poke was the lynchpin.
[37:56.74]Without poke, I can't win.
[38:00.26]Wait, it's a free-for-all.
[38:01.70]Yeah.
[38:09.53]I forgot already.
[38:12.07]Oh, shit.
[38:13.23]Oh!
[38:20.02]Oh, no!
[38:21.16]Holy shit, that was fast.
[38:35.16]Nice poke.
[38:41.43]Yeah.
[38:41.87]Thank you.
[38:48.50]Don't let him farm.
[38:50.46]Don't let him farm.
[39:00.33]Oh.
[39:04.71]Wait, that was a bad thing.
[39:05.49]I shouldn't have done that.
[39:10.46]Woo!
[39:10.56]Oh, I'm alive.
[39:20.41]He's doing his down-ball thing.
[39:23.77]Oh.
[39:23.93]Down-ball.
[39:25.55]Oh, really?
[39:36.10]Jesus.
[39:39.26]Holy shit.
[39:42.39]What?
[39:43.09]Whoa.
[39:44.62]You parried or something?
[39:49.81]Yeah.
[39:50.55]That was crazy.
[39:52.59]Ster, you killed us all.
[39:54.84]Hey, for parrying.
[39:57.33]What is that?
[39:58.29]So what happens is when you're doing those charges and it's like, oh, it's coming, it's coming.
[40:02.43]If you press B, the bunt button, while you're doing your big swing, you create like a circle around you that parries.
[40:10.64]While you're doing your big swing?
[40:12.52]Yeah, so if people just stand on top of you and they're like, oh, I'm going to hit it right at the end, then you can parry.
[40:18.71]Okay.
[40:22.07]Hey, this is your game.
[40:22.79]Were you talking about a different game you were good at?
[40:24.20]This is a different game.
[40:25.12]I thought this was a different game.
[40:34.77]oh my god I don't know why that was so fast that was my killer move
[41:03.46]Oh shit, I thought it was going the other way.
[41:08.77]I guess I just stood there.
[41:10.27]I kind of stood there too.
[41:11.55]Yeah.
[41:30.38]Whoa.
[41:36.65]Holy shit, I don't even know what happened.
[41:39.66]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[41:53.30]Fuck.
[41:56.91]Why?
[41:58.57]I feel like Ster is leaning into his fucking monitor right now.
[42:03.42]I've I've awoken I remember I I like this character a lot sir it's over for you oh so wait you did you press ferry while you're charging yeah and you just oh and then you jump into it you try and take it and it makes the blue circle around it that is uh you might need meter for it I'm not sure
[42:39.94]Someone in my chat wants us to play the train level.
[42:42.48]They've been saying it a bunch.
[42:43.76]Train level?
[42:45.54]Yeah.
[42:46.46]Okay.
[42:51.47]Yeah, we could try the train level.
[42:53.85]Which one's the train level, though?
[42:57.82]Is it the one where you're on a train?
[43:01.04]Literally.
[43:01.38]Is it a bus or a train?
[43:03.66]It's a huge-ass train.
[43:09.04]Oh, this is the song.
[43:14.37]No, Ordinary Days is the song.
[43:21.52]Oh, he does the cool thing.
[43:23.35]Yeah, he does the spin.
[43:26.25]That should be my guy then.
[43:33.86]Yeah, man, I am not.
[43:36.81]I am not doing good again.
[43:43.20]Let's just 1v3, like, do teams 1v3 against her.
[43:50.29]This guy's good.
[43:52.65]That move is crazy.
[43:53.99]How do you even defend against that?
[44:04.90]My old eyes cannot follow.
[44:12.03]Really?
[44:12.31]Nobody got hit by that?
[44:20.85]The berry thing is broken tell me how to do it The one that turns it into the blue ball the be the purple shit What am I doing
[44:58.73]Oh, damn.
[45:00.72]I threw so hard.
[45:07.51]Still anyone's game.
[45:13.59]What do you think here, Vinny?
[45:14.56]We got, uh, we got Ster on the offensive here.
[45:17.76]Oh, how the fuck did you deal with that?
[45:21.14]How did you deal with the special that wrapped around you?
[45:24.85]Ster is leaning real hard into that monitor.
[45:28.82]he's he's gonna get severe eye damage on this one dude that's why you know they told you to do close to the TV he's real up there gosh why is he like goofy why is the commentator goofy hey aren't you the dark part of sephiroth's heart oh wait is that a real quote
[45:50.49]no he go hey cloud aren't sephora you're the dark part of cloud's heart I don't remember what he says I've never played it as long as it's close enough is it true that there's 600 000 lines of dialog in that game I've never played kingdom hearts just corrupt really yeah it's not okay I'm a huge Final Fantasy guy not a kingdom hearts guy just didn't I don't like Disney I have no whimsy in my soul
[46:20.54]Ow.
[46:22.67]This dude hit up.
[46:28.19]I don't really care for Disney.
[46:29.66]I thought the Keyblades were cool.
[46:31.56]Keyblades were cool.
[46:32.18]That's cool.
[46:33.34]I would have enjoyed Kingdom Hearts if I played it when I was younger, but I just didn't buy it.
[46:41.93]But yeah, Jerm, to answer your question from before, SNES is my favorite because of, you know why, Chrono Trigger.
[46:49.24]That's the one.
[46:51.44]and super metroid and link to the past and Super Mario world I never you know I never played super metroid really besides when um you'd rent it at blockbuster or whatever and I know the feel there'd be a save file that was like halfway through the game and I just kind of would walk around
[47:18.32]Let's try to go for a fast ball.
[47:20.35]Oh, I didn't get that.
[47:23.49]Huh!
[47:24.89]Shit.
[47:25.81]You guys want to just try to go for a volley?
[47:27.98]Just do it straight back and forth to each other and see how fast we can get it to go?
[47:32.10]Yeah, no parrying.
[47:42.38]Oh!
[47:44.18]Oh, it's me!
[47:45.50]We all are using specials and shit!
[47:48.44]I mean, that's just button bashing.
[47:52.97]Well, don't do charged hits if you wanted to go fast.
[47:55.57]Wait, Frank Paki did this song?
[47:57.13]The guy from Command and Conquer?
[48:00.56]Just play Tempest Rising today.
[48:01.84]Oh my god, scary.
[48:03.44]It did go too fast randomly.
[48:13.43]I'm getting owned.
[48:14.02]I'm getting farmed.
[48:16.93]Ster versus Vinny.
[48:19.07]Ster's got this.
[48:19.79]Ster versus Vinny here, Jerma.
[48:22.31]What do you think is the strategy that Jerma needs to incorporate in his build here?
[48:28.62]Well, Polk, it's great to say that, but I'm Jerma, by the way.
[48:32.33]I'm up here doing commentary with you.
[48:34.29]Who's down there is currently Ster and Vinny.
[48:38.83]Why are there double balls?
[48:40.20]We got the double ball scenario coming out here, which is a multi-ball, which is a power-up that looks like Ster activated without him knowing.
[48:46.97]And it looks like Vinny's going to take that.
[48:48.37]Oh, you're going to get hit while you're in your attack animation.
[48:50.81]Like, it's John Fishing versus Vinny here.
[48:53.54]Is he going to go and do something?
[48:54.78]He's just not moving.
[48:56.80]Oh, sorry.
[48:57.58]I had my hands on my head.
[48:58.60]I was doing commentary.
[48:59.60]I forgot I still was in the video game.
[49:01.63]Looks like I'm going to go down there and, you know, pull the sleeves up a little and see what I can do.
[49:05.13]Looks like I just kicked his ass.
[49:08.43]The AFK guy won.
[49:09.77]He fucking... He PUBG-rated it out in the corner.
[49:15.14]Alright, it was a good match, but, you know, ultimately, whoever had the chutzpah was able to do... You gotta make sure... Yeah, I gotta make sure.
[49:23.55]What can I do for you?
[49:24.31]Raise your highs, raise your lows, and lower your mids a bit.
[49:29.61]I did that last time, and it hurt my head.
[49:31.69]Yeah, I'm gonna do that.
[49:33.47]Hang on.
[49:33.77]I'll do that.
[49:35.72]Hang on.
[49:36.06]It's the radio voice.
[49:40.83]Alright, just a moment here.
[49:41.99]So raise your highs, raise your lows, and lower the... Hey, everybody.
[49:47.00]Welcome to Mitch and Mitch in the morning, and we're going to be talking about traffic.
[49:52.71]Wow.
[49:53.57]Wow, fellas, this is amazing.
[49:55.19]Wow, I've got a new tool in my arsenal to annoy my audience.
[49:58.29]What do you say, fellas?
[50:00.12]Dude, I wish... Wow, what is that?
[50:02.63]I wish the traffic guy in the morning was like that.
[50:05.48]Wow.
[50:05.84]We're going to talk about the traffic and it is clogged up out there.
[50:08.68]Whoa.
[50:09.38]It is clogged up on the BQE.
[50:11.95]There's a number of accidents on the BQE and they are going mental.
[50:17.17]Well, I'm going to stop doing this now.
[50:20.62]Sounded good.
[50:22.00]Like what you learned?
[50:24.28]Oh, that's great.
[50:25.39]Thanks, man.
[50:31.85]Oh no, your setup is ruined.
[50:33.84]Clogged up like a Chipotle bathroom.
[50:35.86]Does Chipotle get the same kind of, oh, Taco Bell makes you shit your pants.
[50:44.93]Ha ha ha.
[50:45.49]Does Chipotle have that same reputation now?
[50:49.10]There was a chat member that said that one.
[50:50.74]So yeah, I'm going to assume...
[50:53.80]It's the spices, I guess.
[50:55.92]There's no way.
[50:57.86]I was gonna say, I've had Chipotle a handful of times.
[51:01.25]I thought it was fine.
[51:02.27]Yeah, it's fine.
[51:03.83]It's a little overly, like, spiced for my liking.
[51:07.46]I think it's fine.
[51:09.90]I don't think Chipotle is like, oh, dude, Chipotle, yes!
[51:13.16]Oh, it's so good.
[51:14.61]No, it's fine.
[51:16.09]It's fine.
[51:20.77]You know what I did have?
[51:21.67]I don't know.
[51:23.15]Do they have the habit on the East Coast or no?
[51:27.25]No, I don't think I've ever heard of that.
[51:29.78]Have either of you guys had the habit?
[51:31.72]I've heard about it.
[51:33.22]I've heard about it.
[51:34.02]Dude, it is good shit.
[51:35.32]It is, I think, S tier.
[51:36.39]I think it's the best chain fast food burger there is.
[51:41.19]Period.
[51:41.53]Hands down.
[51:42.11]Did you leave your mic settings on?
[51:44.64]Me?
[51:45.58]No, Jerma.
[51:46.00]Do you have those settings on still?
[51:47.74]The lows and highs?
[51:49.16]I never turned the settings on.
[51:52.56]I think my brain just went mind sickness.
[51:54.86]I swear I'm just hearing it.
[51:56.54]The mind sickness consumes.
[52:00.63]Do I just sound like that now?
[52:03.43]I'm just hearing more bass in your voice.
[52:04.74]You sure you're not doing anything funny?
[52:06.98]Am I?
[52:07.14]Maybe I'm putting on a voice.
[52:08.06]Am I?

[52:10.93]How do you not know?
[52:12.01]I don't know.

[53:21.93]Shake Shack has been sick around here.
[53:23.60]Really?
[53:24.00]I feel like the last time I... Shake Shack used to be S tier for me.
[53:29.43]But it went down to like S. They're kind of old for me.
[53:32.41]Hold on, I can't talk and play.
[53:34.63]How am I dead already?
[53:36.48]Shake Shack went from like S to like D plus for me.
[53:42.50]It just kind of got, like, greasy and... Dude, I got it with a burger with lettuce.
[53:46.24]It's like, oh, lettuce, tomato.
[53:47.73]The piece of lettuce that I would get on this burger was such a sad, miserable, one tiny leaf.
[53:53.37]Like, somebody was making a joke of how bad it looked.
[53:56.70]And it was, like, three times, three or four times in a row that I went there.
[53:59.42]I was like, well, this place sucks now.
[54:01.44]That sucks.
[54:04.77]Bro, sir, you gotta stop parrying.
[54:06.47]You're just too good, man.
[54:09.01]You're smurfing.
[54:11.71]Then he gets it.
[54:13.71]I did and now I forgot.
[54:14.73]Oh, I see the ball now.
[54:15.57]Am I dead?
[54:18.02]I'm not playing good this time.
[54:24.25]But dude, if you get opportunity to get the habit.
[54:27.91]It is the best it is doesn't nothing else even comes close.
[54:34.70]Oh, this is our ball.
[54:39.08]Wait, did I parry that and then you'd knock the parry out?
[54:42.67]Is that how that worked?
[54:43.71]Yeah.
[54:44.69]Okay.
[54:46.89]You know what ruined Shake Shack for me?
[54:48.68]This place in Manhattan called Hamburger America.
[54:50.90]I might have mentioned it.
[54:52.32]That place ruined Shake Shack.
[54:55.45]It didn't ruin it, but I'm like, this is okay, but that place is way better.
[54:59.76]That's the place with the onion burger, right?
[55:01.74]yeah it's sick it's so good my god I want it so bad I've seen so many videos of that guy and like him making it and talking about it yep yeah I when I discovered that place like when it first opened I was there like five times so I had to stop I had to slow down because it was like getting sickening for me but um it's really good yeah sounds so amazing but um you were talking about like the the comedy food that gives you the shits and it's like yeah Taco Bell and now chipotle dude white castle
[55:31.97]It's worth it, though.
[55:35.54]I crave White Castle like once every three years at this point in my life.
[55:40.83]White Castle is... That's one of the only places where I think I actually could eat 20 of them.
[55:48.64]One time I went to a party I was invited to.
[55:51.02]I wanted to make a good impression.
[55:52.26]I brought the Crave Crate, which was 50 burgers.
[55:56.59]You brought the Crave Crate to the party?
[55:58.69]They were so happy.
[56:00.35]I made such a good impression.
[56:02.40]I got invited back.
[56:03.06]Holy shit.
[56:03.50]That would be like... You would be invited to every... If a dude showed up with a Crave Crate to the party, that dude is getting invited every time.
[56:11.45]Yeah.
[56:12.77]I was invited a lot, and then the toilets were all clogged up, but other than that, it was great.
[56:16.76]White Castle makes me explode.
[56:20.32]I've never had it.
[56:21.42]Yeah.
[56:23.16]There's a place in Jersey called White Manor, which White Castle, I think, was kind of based off of.
[56:27.79]It's like a legit, like, real burger version of that, and it's good.
[56:31.89]It's really cool.
[56:33.84]But when you leave that place, you smell like onion, so...
[56:45.52]Oh, I tried to get cute with it.
[56:47.95]The wiper.
[56:48.87]The wiper.
[56:51.45]Me.
[56:57.31]Oh my god.
[57:03.42]What's the ghost guy's special?
[57:05.84]He passes into a ghost on the ground sometimes.
[57:09.01]I've seen.
[57:28.34]Oh my god, I tried to time it and it just didn't work.
[57:40.39]Oh!
[57:44.07]White castle's older than white mana?
[57:46.17]Oh, never mind.
[57:47.34]Oh my goodness, I suck!
[57:52.66]Well, let's poke and Ster with a full stock.
[57:58.24]Can we get commentary?
[57:59.66]Yeah, Vinny, let's do commentary.
[58:01.78]Alright.
[58:03.36]So, they got two stock each.
[58:07.35]Polk and Sturge.
[58:08.67]I don't know what's happening.
[58:09.85]Jerma?
[58:10.75]Yeah, it looks like the two stock is... He looks like Polk just fell down there.
[58:15.18]At least it looks like on my screen there.
[58:19.22]That's fantastic.
[58:20.52]I see the ball.
[58:21.81]It's going fast.
[58:22.45]It's going real fast.
[58:22.99]We got a little corner action, folks.
[58:24.39]Corner action, folks.
[58:25.96]And, you know, the alligator that's native to Florida.
[58:30.41]I don't know if you know that, but the Florida alligators, they're crazy from what I hear.
[58:35.94]I hear about that, too.
[58:36.84]That smiley emoji also.
[58:38.30]Did you ever see the Emoji Movie?
[58:40.66]The Emoji Movie.
[58:42.80]Oh, I've certainly seen that one.
[58:45.53]The game is sponsored by the Emoji Movie.
[58:47.75]Check it out.
[58:48.27]That's right.
[58:49.25]But Poke seems to be doing his feet keep moving around and looks like the alligator over there who's... I can't see the number on his jersey.
[58:57.64]What am I doing?
[58:58.32]Oh, he stinks, it seems.
[58:59.74]I got the video game.
[59:00.98]You thought I didn't know how to parry.
[59:02.18]You've been dead for three lives.
[59:03.77]Oh, he stank a little bit, but don't worry about it.
[59:05.53]We got another match coming right up, folks.
[59:09.07]You know the name Bob Euchre?
[59:12.75]Do you know the name Bob Euchre?
[59:14.64]It's vaguely familiar.
[59:16.64]He's like a baseball announcer.
[59:20.32]I know, uh, what's his name?
[59:23.56]The Red Sox announcers were Don Orsello and Jerry Remy.
[59:29.74]Those are the two that did all the Sox broadcasts.
[59:33.80]Yeah, we say Sox around here.
[59:36.15]I know.
[59:37.53]I know.
[59:38.53]Well, I knew who the Yankee guys were, but I don't remember their names now.
[59:41.63]Is that the guy that goes, Steer!
[59:45.02]Derek Jeter with a big home run.
[59:47.16]Steer!
[59:48.42]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:50.02]I forget that dude's name, but... I'm just ducking.
[59:56.31]I'm just ducking.
[60:01.43]That's a skill.
[60:02.05]Commentary like that kind of shit and like keeping it interesting and like knowing what's going on in the game.
[60:07.32]That shit is like tough.
[60:09.36]Especially in art form.
[60:10.46]For like 50 years.
[60:12.90]You just always have something interesting to say.
[60:15.25]Yeah.
[60:17.85]Just like I got killed.
[60:20.86]Just like you, man.
[60:28.65]Red Sox fans, glad to hear it.
[60:31.15]The Boston Red Sox are world champions.
[60:35.32]I'm dead.
[60:42.93]Oh, whoa.
[60:44.67]Oh, whoa.
[60:54.50]Why?
[60:55.61]I think chat lied to me and it's been getting me killed.
[60:59.00]I read chat and it was... What'd they say?
[61:02.21]That grabs can't be parried or something.
[61:04.87]I don't know.
[61:05.23]Then I go to do the grab and then I just get like auto parried.
[61:10.02]Hey Vinny, remember when the Red Sox swept the Yankees in 2004?
[61:14.08]I do remember that.
[61:15.66]I do actually remember that, yeah.
[61:17.02]And I also remember the Diamondbacks winning against the Yankees in 2001.
[61:20.83]And that was like a blow to the nation.
[61:24.03]That was like, everyone was focused on that and like people were crying in school the next day.
[61:28.28]Dude.
[61:28.96]It was sort of like fucked up.
[61:31.10]Hey Vinny, focus on this.
[61:35.83]That was so slow.
[61:38.43]Dude.
[61:38.55]Why did I try to grab that?
[61:42.29]See, because someone in chat told you to.
[61:47.54]The Yankees, I haven't followed baseball in many years.
[61:53.99]What were you going to say though?
[61:56.13]are the yankees any good anymore like I feel like it wasn't a steinbrenner right I feel like they've gotten close oh he quit a couple times can you go back sir ended up I can't go back oh yeah sorry what happened oak left he left I'll watch for a game they won in 20 2009 and then never again since then
[62:30.89]Jerma, did you play Scrandall?
[62:34.05]Scrandall?
[62:34.79]No.
[62:36.46]It's, like, mortal, but, um... It's, like, stadium food.
[62:44.53]No.
[62:45.03]I figured that would be something you'd be interested in, because, like, you like baseball, but... That sounds kind of cool.
[62:51.00]It's a fun thing.
[62:51.82]Yeah, Northernlion really liked that.
[62:54.34]I like Scrandall.
[62:54.78]Check it out.
[62:56.35]You played Scrandall, Poke?
[62:57.91]Yeah, but sometimes it's just, like...
[63:00.05]Sometimes it just don't make no sense.
[63:02.47]Yeah, that's true.
[63:04.49]We should do a group scandal.
[63:06.32]Yeah, that would be fun.
[63:09.94]It's like, what's better, this hot dog or this piece of pizza from this shitty stadium?
[63:15.51]Is it based on reviews or is it just... It's other people that are just, like, you have to kind of imagine which one looks better.
[63:23.74]That's it.
[63:24.36]And you compare it against other people's opinions.
[63:26.88]Oh, funny.
[63:28.40]Sir, are you a sports guy or no?
[63:31.22]Ping pong.
[63:33.01]No, I'm serious.

[63:48.99]I don't know if I believe this.
[63:53.19]Ask me a question.
[63:54.26]Test my knowledge.
[63:56.06]Alright.
[63:57.14]What's it called when the ball is short of the net?
[64:02.92]Short of the net?
[64:04.43]Short of the net.
[64:05.93]Short?
[64:06.51]It's... No.
[64:09.47]No, it's called gazpacho.
[64:11.87]Oh, Ster.
[64:13.13]He got you with the gazpacho.
[64:18.30]Uh, we got getting poked in here?
[64:19.78]Why, Vinny, I'm not lying to you.
[64:21.18]Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

[67:08.07]Y'all see that?
[67:08.71]Is it the Ninja Swirly, by any chance, Polk?
[67:11.57]Yeah, yeah.
[67:14.17]Oh.
[67:14.33]Can you, like, do a video on that?
[67:16.23]Yeah, I wanna make videos on it and make really stupid drinks and ice cream.
[67:20.32]Dude, ketchup.
[67:22.26]I'm down.
[67:22.70]Do you want me to do it for you?
[67:24.11]Nah, don't do ketchup.
[67:25.83]Dude, you can make some banger stuff.
[67:26.75]I was thinking, like, making a video of, like, getting you guys' suggestions.
[67:30.38]Like, send a video in.
[67:32.06]Like, hey, make this for me.
[67:33.86]And I'll make it and try it.
[67:35.34]I would do.
[67:35.78]I would come up with something for you.
[67:37.65]Really?
[67:38.03]Grenadine and shepherd's pie.
[67:39.95]Ooh, no.
[67:41.05]What?
[67:41.35]I thought you were going to say ice cream.
[67:43.07]How can I make it food, though?
[67:44.51]I mean, a drink?
[67:45.34]No, no, no.
[67:46.20]We'll figure something out.
[67:47.08]We'll figure something out.
[67:47.86]It's got to be liquids.
[67:49.64]Yeah.
[67:52.91]But I'm down.
[67:55.50]Yeah, Poke, you wanna know something?
[67:57.38]I'll give you a couple of swirly tips, okay?
[67:59.60]Well, you have one?
[68:00.86]I may or may not have had access to one.
[68:03.84]Okay.
[68:05.37]Yeah, this guy got a lot of swirlies in high school.
[68:06.93]He's so cagey about it.
[68:08.63]Yeah, I mean, how is it?
[68:09.91]Is it your friend?
[68:11.01]Your friend has a good one?
[68:14.85]Your friend?
[68:15.22]You know, I have one.
[68:15.94]The thing's fucking awesome.
[68:18.52]Yeah, I knew it was a good idea.
[68:19.64]Jerma has one.
[68:21.10]Dude, me and Holly make ice cream all the time.
[68:24.62]Like, all the time.
[68:26.28]Oh, man.
[68:28.47]Do I have to get one now?
[68:29.77]I seriously thought it was just like a... I mean, the thing is a gigantic... I thought it was just a huge gimmick.
[68:36.10]But it makes soft serve.
[68:37.96]Like, okay, when you think of an ice cream maker, like, oh, yeah, this thing makes soft serve.
[68:42.36]They all suck.
[68:43.35]They've all been terrible products.
[68:44.95]Awful products.
[68:46.69]So making soft serve at home is like, okay, go fuck yourself.
[68:51.67]That's not possible.
[68:52.41]Yeah, yeah.
[68:53.49]It makes... It's awesome.
[68:56.30]It is literally, I can't believe it, that it's that good.
[68:58.10]What's the name of this thing?
[68:59.27]Swirly.
[69:00.77]Swirly?
[69:01.97]See?
[69:02.09]See?
[69:03.30]Dude, remind us to click a like.
[69:05.28]If you follow the recipes, you don't... I mean, you could put, like, crazy shit in there if you want, but... If you actually do, like, the signature vanilla soft-serve ice cream, it is as good as any other... And you make it at home, you know what's in it.
[69:18.94]You know what's going in there.
[69:23.01]There's no barcode on it, no chemicals in the back of that box.
[69:26.60]You know where it came from.
[69:30.99]Damn, I just stood there while y'all died.
[69:34.84]This is a crazy match.
[69:35.64]Look at look at the stock.
[69:36.68]We're all one Flipper dies.
[69:44.59]Okay.
[69:44.95]Wow.
[69:45.25]I just got picked on Son of a gun
[70:05.62]Why?
[70:06.20]Why?
[70:11.06]I see ninja swirl.
[70:12.87]Dude, you can put, you can put, take canned pineapples, take a banana, mush it up, put coconut milk or coconut cream and like vanilla extract and you make literally a like fake Dole Whip from Disney and it's fucking amazing.
[70:30.37]It's funny that you should say that.
[70:32.02]Not the same thing, but they sell those.
[70:33.54]I have one.
[70:34.44]I have a package of them.
[70:36.06]The Dole Whips.
[70:37.28]They're pretty good.
[70:37.82]I just had them for the first time recently.
[70:39.44]But you can just kind of make your own, like, the way they do it in Disney.
[70:44.91]It tastes pretty close.
[70:46.19]You can make it pretty close.
[70:48.43]That's cool.
[70:51.12]The freezer ones aren't as good.
[70:52.68]Okay.
[70:53.06]Yeah, they're good, though.
[70:53.94]But, I mean, I enjoyed it, but apparently the Disney ones are, like, amazing.
[70:59.46]Oh.
[71:01.21]you make coffee stuff with it yeah I think you can make like coffee ice cream oh coffee you can make like an ice cap I saw a video yeah you do um it's ice cap oh you you just put uh you brew coffee let it cool down put it in there I think you put a little bit of heavy cream some vanilla extract some milk and you can make yourself extract pretty sure it's in a lot of stuff they have a whole recipe book it's it's pretty good vanilla extract is the shit
[71:26.69]Now, I mean, this thing is expensive.
[71:27.99]This thing is, it is like a, and by the way, Poke, when you use this thing, um, your whole house is going to shake.
[71:34.14]Really?
[71:35.77]Yes.
[71:36.27]It's like, it's like one of the loudest machines I've ever, it's louder than a vacuum cleaner at full speed.
[71:42.22]Oh God.
[71:48.83]It was like $300.
[71:49.71]It was like $300.
[71:51.45]Yeah, I mean, it's expensive.
[71:52.81]It is.
[71:53.09]For something that just makes ice cream?
[71:56.44]No, but that's how you know it's good, too.
[71:58.72]Because if you buy one thing that does one thing, and it's that much money, it's got to be good.
[72:04.94]I was very skeptical.
[72:06.40]Me and Holly were incredibly skeptical.
[72:09.09]And that's kind of why I wanted to buy it.
[72:11.01]Because I heard people talking about it like, oh man, no, it's actually really good.
[72:14.18]It's like, yeah, you follow shit.
[72:15.36]You can't make ice cream at home.
[72:16.62]I was the guy in the infomercial that comes in when they're doing the demonstration like, you can't make ice cream at home.
[72:21.87]That's impossible.
[72:29.68]How did I get killed by that?
[72:31.32]I saw you farming.
[72:32.89]Oh, shit.
[72:33.41]This is a big conversation that we have not talked about.
[72:37.15]Can we get our take on the boo-boos?
[72:40.62]The boo-boos?
[72:41.62]I hate that one.
[72:44.08]Have you guys heard of the stuff called the boo-boos?
[72:48.57]Oh, okay.
[72:49.65]Yeah, yep.
[72:50.94]The monster faces.
[72:53.05]Yeah, have you guys... Vinny, have you heard of it?
[72:55.53]I... I feel like the name is familiar.
[72:58.16]LeBooBoo.
[72:58.84]Let me... Dude, it is, like, taking over the world.
[73:02.92]You have no idea.
[73:03.62]What do you mean, taking over the world?
[73:05.00]LeBooBoo.
[73:05.96]Bro, it is insanely big, and you have no idea how big they are.
[73:09.79]Like, it is... It's like... It's like, um... You go to a store called PopMart, and you... PopMart's like a mall store, right?
[73:18.10]Yeah, yeah.
[73:18.64]It's like a mall store.
[73:20.08]And you just gamble a doll...
[73:22.50]Like a blind box?
[73:23.68]Yeah, a blind box.
[73:24.34]It's a blind box.
[73:25.88]Just look up a Labubu.
[73:28.17]And everyone loves them right now.
[73:29.73]Why are they loving them?
[73:31.99]Are they like rare ones?
[73:33.78]I don't know.
[73:34.64]I really don't know how deep it goes, but I just know they are so popular.
[73:38.16]It's just... Beanie Babies for Zoomers is what a chat member of mine said.
[73:42.13]Is that accurate, you think?
[73:44.45]Yeah, I mean, it's just the biggest market.
[73:45.77]It's like the biggest thing right now, I'd say.
[73:47.65]Well, that and Dubai Chocolate.
[73:50.12]Yeah.
[73:51.30]But yeah.
[73:52.55]I held the button for too long.
[74:00.17]How'd you get this character?
[74:07.42]Holy shit!
[74:21.16]Yeah, I think they're so ugly.
[74:23.44]Yeah, they're gross.
[74:25.86]You saw it?
[74:26.32]Yeah, I looked it up.
[74:27.22]I hate it.
[74:29.33]It's like troll dolls.
[74:30.69]I had my tonsils removed when I was in second grade.
[74:33.19]And it was, you know, like the first time I was in surgery for something.
[74:37.51]And my parents bought me a troll doll for the Philadelphia Eagles.
[74:42.60]And it was the worst gift I ever could have received.
[74:45.12]I hated it so much.
[74:48.06]Oh.
[74:49.04]Is it like a Furby?
[74:52.06]It's like a troll doll, just like a little... Oh, trolls!
[74:54.62]I remember with the hair, with the hair on the back.
[74:56.36]The ugly motherfucking things.
[74:57.56]I hate them.
[74:58.08]Yeah, yeah, trolls.
[74:58.74]Yeah, yeah.
[74:59.88]So I associate tonsil pain with troll dolls now.
[75:07.75]What was that up there?
[75:10.51]Power up.
[75:11.97]Those don't... They only show up once in a while, those power-ups, don't they?
[75:16.28]Yeah, I don't know why.
[75:19.38]I don't remember that mechanic either.
[75:20.70]Maybe there's a setting.
[75:23.48]You know, down below you have like six of them.
[75:24.82]GG has like one or two Labubus.
[75:30.77]I don't have a Labubus.
[75:31.45]Oh my god, I was fucking stupid!
[75:33.83]I was trying to... I got super addicted to, and still am, the Final Fantasy Magic the Gathering cards.
[75:42.20]I keep trying to get like a Gold Chocobo or a Vivi.
[75:46.11]And it's like, that's been a money sink for me.
[75:48.71]So, I can't really complain if people are buying garbage.
[75:52.70]So...
[75:54.44]There was this little place that was down the strip in Vegas here.
[75:58.15]It has a bunch of those... You put in a token and you turn it and you get a little ball and it's a little weird toy.
[76:05.06]A gacha machine?
[76:08.06]Yes.
[76:09.32]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[76:10.16]They had a ton of them.
[76:11.51]There's a huge, huge place in the strip where it just has at least one to two hundred of them.
[76:17.72]At least.
[76:18.04]I got this creamsicle guy and I was like, holy shit, I got a cool creamsicle guy now.
[76:24.34]Yeah, I've spent more money on those things than I should probably tell you all about.
[76:28.99]I just love tchotchkes.
[76:30.33]I don't know.
[76:32.01]There's a Bandai Namco store.
[76:34.65]A couple of them nearby.
[76:36.30]And they have those.
[76:37.82]And they have, like, officially licensed.
[76:39.44]Well, they have, like, Ape Escape ones.
[76:40.74]You get a peepo monkey.
[76:42.48]Oh, cool.
[76:45.04]How did I jump into that like an idiot?
[76:47.04]Yeah, I want to publicly apologize to the Labubu fan base.
[76:49.59]I'm sorry for what I said.
[76:50.37]They're attacking me right now.
[76:51.83]Are they?
[76:52.11]I'm freaking out.
[76:53.19]I'm in a lot of anxiety right now.
[76:56.05]And I'd like to apologize to the Dubai Chocolate fans for saying that it existed.
[77:03.10]Sorry to Dubai.
[77:05.27]Yeah.
[77:06.50]What is it again?
[77:07.98]What is it again?
[77:08.68]I don't know.
[77:09.24]It's green.
[77:09.94]It's green and chocolate.
[77:11.17]What is it?
[77:11.57]Is it pistachio?
[77:12.95]I think I tasted a drink.
[77:15.91]That was like a Dubai chocolate milkshake.
[77:18.62]And it tasted 100% like Frosted Mini Wheats.
[77:22.34]Really?
[77:22.58]That's... Okay.
[77:24.73]So dumb that it became a trend.
[77:26.19]The dry side.
[77:27.77]Not even the white... Oh, the dry side.
[77:30.34]The dry side.
[77:31.54]I get it.
[77:33.70]What are we doing?
[77:35.02]What is that?
[77:35.59]What the fuck am I doing?
[77:44.91]I tried to parry you.
[77:54.47]Oh, gotcha!
[77:55.27]Frosted Mini-Wheats are good, though.
[77:57.30]Frosted Mini-Wheats are one of the best cereals, in my opinion.
[77:59.46]Frosted Mini-Wheats are good, but you have to eat them within 10 seconds.
[78:02.33]Like, the first three bites are good, and then the rest of it's, like, soggy.
[78:06.13]True.
[78:07.95]Skill issue, though.
[78:08.62]I mean, I don't know.
[78:09.58]Yeah, just don't put so much in the bowl, you dumbass.
[78:14.28]How many did you put in there?
[78:15.27]Three?
[78:17.17]Well, you just do a little bit, and a little bit of milk, and a little bit, and a little bit of milk.
[78:22.28]You don't need to do, like, a gallon of milk.
[78:28.63]When's the horseman RTS?
[78:30.27]My special move.
[78:32.89]We were talking about doing Warcraft 3.
[78:34.92]It'll happen.
[78:35.94]I know it'll happen at some point.
[78:37.36]There's no way we're going to not play Warcraft 3.
[78:41.38]I have a bunch of custom games that have the map files, but when I was testing them out,
[78:48.14]It was... They were kind of bugged.
[78:51.28]So, I don't know if it's a reforged thing or you have to play Classic with some of these, but Darwin's Island I tested.
[78:57.07]And the heal sound, there's just somebody being healed loud in your ears over and over again.
[79:04.88]And I don't know how to turn it off, and I think it's a bug on the map with reforged.
[79:08.40]It might be a reforged thing, yeah.
[79:09.96]Yeah.
[79:10.93]That's a shame.
[79:11.77]Original Warcraft 3 people are saying is probably what we need to do.
[79:15.21]I think we should do Mario Party.
[79:17.30]That would go nuts.
[79:19.48]I wouldn't.
[79:20.38]There's going to be a Switch 2 version of Jamboree.
[79:23.85]Any of you guys have a Switch 2?
[79:26.37]I'll get one.
[79:27.51]I'll read it tomorrow.
[79:28.81]No, I heard there was one game.
[79:31.34]Oh, you mean the Mario Kart machine?
[79:35.04]There's one game.
[79:36.60]Yeah, I heard it's like a plug-and-play machine with one game on it.
[79:40.42]Donkey Kong comes out next week so I'm pretty excited but yeah it's Mario Kart machine but uh Mario Party Jamboree I could play the switch one version too but it's a good game it's really that'd be fun to play I think we'd get some fun times out of that it actually has one game still right right now it's got a couple like versions of third party games but yes it's got like one Nintendo exclusive and that's Mario Kart it's good I like Mario Kart it's not
[80:06.86]like fucking mind blowing.
[80:08.34]It's just a good game.
[80:09.16]But yeah, I don't know if it's worth the price.
[80:12.25]The knockout mode seems like kind of fun.
[80:15.18]I will say.
[80:15.56]Knockout mode's awesome.
[80:16.86]Yeah.
[80:19.97]Damn.
[80:21.54]I really want to play the Donkey Kong, but I don't think I can justify playing a $550 whatever video game.
[80:27.31]That thing just disappeared.
[80:29.65]You know what you do, Star?
[80:30.83]Just give it another year.
[80:32.31]Wait until it has more than two games, and then see what happens, you know?
[80:37.98]Yeah, just see what happens.
[80:39.30]See what happens.
[80:42.61]I bought a PS5 Pro for GTA 6.
[80:45.37]Oh.
[80:45.57]You guys are going to need one too.
[80:52.20]PC version, no?
[80:54.14]That doesn't come out at the same time, no?
[80:56.23]But what game?
[80:58.41]GTA.
[80:59.79]Oh, GTA 6.
[81:01.03]Yeah, judging by the last few Rockstar releases, the PC version probably wouldn't be out for like a year.
[81:06.90]Goddamn.
[81:08.30]Well, it should still work on PS5 regular, yeah?
[81:11.52]It probably will.
[81:12.56]Performance mode.
[81:13.65]Yeah.
[81:15.11]It's fine.
[81:15.55]I can just deal with it.
[81:17.49]I'm playing Death Stranding 2 on performance mode, and it's a really nice looking game.
[81:26.24]I'm a DLSS Andy.
[81:27.89]I hate it.
[81:28.83]I can notice the blurs and stuff.
[81:31.35]I don't know what it is.
[81:34.17]It's annoying.
[81:35.14]I don't disagree with that.
[81:38.34]I played Cyberpunk with the DLSS and there were some, it was like an earlier form and it was, yeah, it was rough.
[81:44.69]This thing is going to go very fast.
[81:48.66]Wow.
[81:49.52]I have two stocks still.
[81:51.12]Dude, you just kind of owned us.
[81:52.75]When the ping pong guy dies, he says, and that's actually accurate.
[81:59.12]Why is he talking so much shit about Stirr?
[82:02.64]I'm not I just said he's I said he's no talking about me y'all want to hop on Fortnite no let's do it you guys would not do it I'll be down I would not do it I wouldn't not do it okay how about we do it next time for like one game no Fortnite only if I could play as Thanos
[82:32.22]be Peter Griffin is that not okay that actually is kind of good enough but I don't want to play Fortnite so so I played Fortnite to try to get to the ai Darth Vader to hear him say weird and it was a nightmare to do that I tried for like an hour and I just gave up honestly me too I thought it would be a good stream bit but I just didn't it wasn't worth the time
[82:58.54]It was off stream chat.
[82:59.57]Yeah, I just played on my own.
[83:00.75]It was... Did nothing.
[83:01.91]You had that still in your mouth still?
[83:04.97]Ow.
[83:10.68]Also, in terms of RTS games, there's not really a lot.
[83:13.42]But I just... Today I played two hours of this game called Tempest Rising.
[83:17.71]And it's like a new Command & Conquer type game.
[83:20.61]Like an indie game.
[83:22.41]Yeah, I've seen that.
[83:23.55]Really good.
[83:24.78]Really good.
[83:25.18]I really enjoyed it.
[83:30.84]I played Bio-Forge, that game was sick.
[83:35.37]Bio-Forge is a great game.
[83:36.93]I was watching you play that game.
[83:38.63]What's Bio-Forge?
[83:39.85]Jeremy, I was watching you play that game and then there was like this one part where it was like steel drums being spammed like crazy.
[83:47.46]And I was like, why does he not care about this more?
[83:52.43]The amount of people in the comments of like YouTube videos and stuff that were like, man, this game was so fucking awful to listen to.
[83:58.31]Like it was painful, some of these scenes.
[84:01.96]Maybe I am getting old.
[84:03.40]I'm just like, what are they talking about?
[84:04.76]I can't hear it.
[84:05.40]1995 action-adventure game?
[84:11.99]Yeah, it was.
[84:12.79]It was kind of just like... It sounded like it was bugged out.
[84:18.40]Like something was corrupted.
[84:23.60]Oh, shit.
[84:24.18]Vinny, you're the fucking OG of corruptions.
[84:28.51]That is actually crazy, because I remember like...
[84:30.97]eight years ago downloading the software that your community made to do corruptions and I I do that stuff sometimes that's crazy I love the corruption stuff yeah it was fun it's been harder to kind of keep up with it because like after you've seen all the crazy like where do you go yeah so but yeah no the corruptions were were good to me and uh it was fun
[84:53.60]Vinny, I don't know how you hit that because I was trying to fake them out to hit you and you ended up being one millisecond brain speed and got it.
[85:18.11]I don't know how you did that.
[85:19.35]don't know either man sometimes things just happen right just happen yo oh I tried to parry good shit Ster Ster is pretty good
[85:52.73]Whoa.
[85:54.65]Oh, the twirly, the swirly.
[85:57.73]This guy.
[85:59.44]Years of swirlies paid off.
[86:04.34]I just gave you that, didn't I?
[86:06.04]Kind of, but... Make it go the highest... We have not seen a high number, by the way.
[86:14.90]Really?
[86:15.84]Yeah, I feel like when I was playing a long time ago...
[86:19.10]lot easier numbers like crazy but you want to know what it is it's Ster Ster taught us the parry mechanic in 1v1 it's actually a lot easier to get it to go faster when you know people can parry because then wait I think it's because it's actually not just four places kind of crazy ones yeah that's why yeah 1v1 is a lot simpler how did I not
[86:52.96]Oh, I was trying to get it.
[86:55.30]Couldn't.
[86:57.00]Mmm, parried backwards.
[86:59.70]How is this an unction?
[87:00.70]What is an unction?
[87:05.21]Bunch of old people playing a game?
[87:06.47]Is that what an unction is?
[87:08.33]I think that's what that's called.
[87:09.30]I think that's what he's saying.
[87:11.30]I see.
[87:11.92]An unction?
[87:12.80]Hocus is like the baby of the groupies.
[87:17.20]This dude's got his whole life ahead of him.
[87:20.47]Oh, I'm older than everyone I know.
[87:23.75]I come here, I'm the young guy.
[87:25.49]You know us, yeah.
[87:26.96]I was the young guy once too, Poke.
[87:29.40]I was the young guy.
[87:30.42]That happened, I said to myself, and now I'm dead.
[87:32.96]We don't got a room full of cigars and like a poker table in front of us.
[87:38.29]How old is Poke?
[87:38.89]Like 18?
[87:39.59]I'm 32.
[87:42.15]I don't like cigars, but the idea of playing poker with you guys with like a glass of whiskey and like having a cigar in the room would be fantastic right now.
[87:51.28]Dude, I was saying... Yeah, dude, it's fun.
[87:56.30]Poke, we talked a long time ago.
[87:57.58]Remember when you talked about breaking the geodes?
[88:01.16]Yes.
[88:02.19]I still want to do that.
[88:02.95]Yeah, I mean, that was some of the most fun I've ever had on stream in my life.
[88:06.91]Oh, when you did the geode thing.
[88:09.03]It was like five years ago, right?
[88:10.27]Yeah, like 2021, 22?
[88:11.95]I think three or four years ago.
[88:14.16]Three.
[88:18.88]Oh, here it comes.
[88:20.64]Dude, it's at 2,000.
[88:25.85]That shit is too fast.
[88:32.21]Oi.
[88:34.80]Oi, don't parry, don't parry.
[88:35.64]Just go for it.
[88:37.16]Oh.
[88:40.05]Wait, this is the guy.
[88:40.93]Hideki Naganuma.
[88:42.95]That's the guy who said he's not Jerma.
[88:44.73]That he wasn't Jerma.
[88:45.59]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[88:46.05]Apparently he's a shit poster.
[88:48.52]Oh.
[88:50.08]I don't know that guy I'm out
[89:25.24]Stairs locked, uh, out.
[89:28.64]Locked out.
[89:29.04]So you could have locked in, then you died.
[89:31.20]I died.
[89:32.53]I'm locked out.
[89:33.51]But we could do, we could do open up geodes, and then move immediately after that to a table with cigars and whiskey, and play poker, and have an unction.
[89:45.40]I would actually genuinely fly out to Vegas.
[89:48.03]I'll fly out.
[89:50.33]I've been, like, I've wanted to do that for so long and yet I haven't.
[89:54.42]But one day, I would like to.
[89:56.90]I live in Vegas.
[89:58.38]If you plan on this Geo thing, I will fly out for it.
[90:03.27]I'll just watch.
[90:03.87]I don't even need to be on camera.
[90:05.07]I'll just hang.
[90:05.73]That stream will just be called The Unction.
[90:08.18]Ster, you're coming to fly with me.
[90:11.40]Yeah, Ster.
[90:12.42]Ster, we gotta hang, Ster.
[90:15.23]Ster, we really do need to go to Wildwood, though.
[90:18.07]Oh, dude, I fucking grew up in the Wildwood.
[90:23.16]I know we talk about this like a lot, but we really like that would be the best.
[90:29.52]That would be pretty crazy.
[90:30.54]It's been a long time since I've been there.
[90:33.09]It sucks just as much, if not more.
[90:36.31]I like you love it.
[90:37.71]Maybe I didn't know better.
[90:40.75]No, we definitely I know better and I still go there every year because I'm insane, but I just I like it's fun.
[90:52.50]I think I've only died to Ster parrying it.
[90:55.98]He's too good at this thing.
[91:03.57]Oh my goodness.
[91:04.64]I was turtling.
[91:07.78]Kill him.
[91:11.79]Oh yeah, we actually did kill him.
[91:13.33]Yeah, but now it's going to be an uphill battle.
[91:21.15]Alright, you guys try to get it.
[91:22.61]You stay in left and right.
[91:24.32]You guys try to get it to go like 10,000.
[91:27.54]Only do sidewards.
[91:28.74]That's like harder to do.
[91:32.31]What, you don't want to challenge?
[91:33.55]Oh, I don't want to like hurt him.
[91:39.35]Oh, Ster got hit.
[91:40.79]Oh, Ster's getting hit.
[91:47.63]You did, you ate it.
[91:49.33]Why'd you eat it?
[91:50.49]Accident.
[91:51.33]I did by accident.
[91:58.10]Do a couple more?
[92:00.06]Yeah, that sounds good.
[92:02.37]Alright.
[92:02.59]I'm getting kind of to the point where I have to make a decision on if I want to continue streaming or play RimWorld now.
[92:09.38]Yeah.
[92:11.22]I'm addicted to Tarkov right now, I think.
[92:13.26]It just wiped.
[92:15.59]Dude, I saw someone say Wipe Day is my favorite on the social media platforms, and I was like, what the fuck are they talking about?
[92:24.46]They wipe once a week?
[92:27.24]It's like they blow up their ass?
[92:29.71]I know, I thought they were talking about their ass, though.
[92:34.31]Alright, poke, poke.
[92:36.90]You've gotta give me the two or three sentence elevator pitch.
[92:42.08]I keep hearing, dude, don't fucking play Tarkov.
[92:44.79]That game sucks.
[92:45.91]Like, don't do it.
[92:46.81]No, it's so good.
[92:49.21]Tell me about it.
[92:51.25]It's just genuine, true horror.
[92:55.26]You'll never experience horror like that.
[92:57.64]It's just so immersive.
[93:01.46]Okay, so it's like a horror game.
[93:04.29]This pitch is amazing.
[93:07.53]I don't know.
[93:07.89]It's a scary game.
[93:09.98]It is scary.
[93:10.82]I think it is scary.
[93:12.18]When you're about to lose your loot that you've worked so hard to get, yeah, it's kind of scary.
[93:16.33]Not even that.
[93:17.49]Dude, it is a scary game.
[93:19.23]Like, the ambience and everything like that, you have to hide.
[93:22.62]Okay.
[93:23.02]Not make any noise.
[93:24.40]If you right-click your gun, some Chad will hear you.
[93:27.40]Do that from, like, you know what I'm saying?
[93:31.51]The more you play, the better it gets, for real.
[93:34.09]I don't know.
[93:34.69]I'm bad at selling it.
[93:37.00]I think you did a pretty good job selling it.
[93:40.50]What the hell was that?
[93:41.18]It has a lot of bullshit.
[93:41.91]It has a lot of bullshit.
[93:43.29]He parried me.
[93:44.01]And the devs are confusing and they make the game worse.
[93:48.16]But it's fine.
[93:48.48]I've heard that.
[93:49.20]I've only played it like two or three times, but I... You know what?
[93:53.10]Jeremy, did you play Dark and Darker?
[93:54.31]I did.
[93:55.49]We played together.
[93:56.49]Dude, I heard they keep... Okay.
[93:57.99]I heard they keep changing that game every three months.
[94:00.94]It's like to be a different video game.
[94:03.52]Does anybody know anything about this?
[94:05.48]Yeah.
[94:07.13]have a theory but it might not be right but I think it's right that's right they lost a lawsuit oh yeah the lawsuit yeah yeah they lost the lawsuit big time oh that's okay I just don't think they're motivated to make uh money
[94:22.42]Because I went to the, I was checking it out like, I want to say like a few weeks ago, and it was just like, oh, I wonder how this is doing.
[94:27.87]It's like, oh, a bunch of this stuff has changed.
[94:29.41]People are not happy with the changes.
[94:31.37]Solo doesn't work anymore.
[94:32.33]They added an adventure mode that's PvE, but people don't like that.
[94:35.40]It was just kind of, seemed like a lot of stuff was all over the place.
[94:39.08]There's no stats on gear anymore either.
[94:40.54]What happened to, like, just Super Mario?
[94:46.50]Back in the old days.
[94:47.54]That really is super good.
[94:49.17]Dark and Darker, I think, really was like the... It was so fun.
[94:53.21]It was just such a fun game.
[94:56.46]There were some games that did a similar thing that I played demos of, and I don't remember the names of them, but Dark and Darker was like... I was really fucking into that, and nothing has recaptured that.
[95:07.04]I agree.
[95:09.26]I agree.
[95:13.96]I would say Tarkov is like the shooters of that to me.
[95:16.66]Yeah.
[95:17.60]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[95:22.69]Well, wasn't Tarkov kind of the original extraction kind of popular game that went like that?
[95:28.84]Yeah.
[95:30.40]I mean, if you don't count like Arma mods, I guess.
[95:32.98]I think they had shit before.
[95:35.32]Arma mods started a lot of different things, if I'm not mistaken, right?
[95:39.33]Arma was a hugely popular modding platform.
[95:42.43]It started as much stuff as, I guess, Warcraft customers.
[95:46.87]Warcraft and Half-Life are the patron saints of starting new games from their modding community.
[95:55.90]If more games allowed modding, we'd have way more games.
[95:58.63]You think that's true or no?
[95:59.95]Yes.
[96:00.43]We'd have new genres by now and stuff?
[96:02.79]Yeah, for sure.
[96:03.43]100%.
[96:05.32]But so many developers are very insular about that kind of thing.
[96:09.75]Kind of sucks.
[96:10.33]Yeah.
[96:11.71]Oh, Doom.
[96:12.56]Quake.
[96:13.00]Quake and Doom.
[96:14.36]Those are two pretty important ones for modding, too.
[96:16.62]Yeah, of course.
[96:18.35]Quake invented Team Fortress.
[96:21.21]For me, it's all about StarCraft.
[96:22.83]Those maps from StarCraft growing up.
[96:25.76]Yeah.
[96:26.04]Making mazes.
[96:27.30]Did either one of us get that?
[96:31.24]Yeah, Starcraft was a big one for me too.
[96:33.53]Warcraft 2 was one I was like... Do you remember this weird Starcraft map where you turn off the lights and you turn off the fog of war and you spam turrets on a bugged spot and you can make a million turrets in a maze?
[96:47.25]I don't know.
[96:47.53]It's like a specific maze TD thing.
[96:49.47]Did I throw?
[96:50.37]I don't know.
[96:54.08]Now that one I don't remember.
[96:55.14]I do remember a lot of the Starcraft stuff I liked ended up becoming Warcraft 3 mods.
[97:00.25]So it's like that kind of started a whole thing.
[97:04.96]And then obviously Dota came from that.
[97:06.84]You played Dota shit, right?
[97:08.73]Poke, like League?
[97:09.57]Yeah.
[97:10.67]Yeah, I dropped out of high school to go to an internet cafe and play Dota all the time.
[97:15.32]Oh my god.
[97:16.90]Well, you got the last laugh.
[97:18.72]Yeah.
[97:19.48]To be fair.
[97:23.15]I wish I stayed, I'll be honest.
[97:25.89]Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's good.
[97:28.13]To anyone listening in all the streams, just stay in high school.
[97:30.37]It's so worth it.
[97:31.96]Stay in high school.
[97:34.80]College is your choice, but high school, just finish it.
[97:38.59]It is just... Trust.
[97:41.69]Probably a good idea.
[97:44.52]Yeah.
[97:50.68]Yeah, Warcraft 3 was so fun.
[97:53.52]I got some of those old Tower Defense line war games.
[97:58.61]Do you guys remember the hero line war?
[98:01.11]Yep.
[98:01.61]I got the one I remember.
[98:04.30]It's awesome, but I just don't know if it's going to work great on Reforged.
[98:07.42]That's why we probably should just get the classic one and just try to figure that out.
[98:11.45]Could do that.
[98:13.83]There's a lot of standalone games now of those maps, right?
[98:16.72]I think so, yeah.
[98:17.34]There are, yeah.
[98:20.68]All that stuff has been mined.
[98:22.20]I just farmed Vinny so hard in the corner.
[98:27.15]Hero Line Wars does work on Reforged.
[98:29.17]I have a couple mods that are big Warcraft 3 fans.
[98:31.31]They might be able to guide us in the right direction.
[98:33.29]Ooh.
[98:33.99]As well.
[98:34.58]Yeah, they could probably help if we do something like that.
[98:42.63]Really, sir?
[98:44.09]Just cheat.
[98:45.15]Okay.
[98:46.15]Cheat.
[98:46.31]Cheat.
[98:46.89]Aeon of Strife for StarCraft 1.
[98:48.95]That's the original.
[98:53.72]I never played it though.
[98:55.14]I'll do one more.
[98:56.46]My brain is starting to glaze over from this game as much as I'm enjoying it.
[98:59.81]Yeah, I'm just hitting the ball.
[99:00.65]I'm not even thinking about what I'm doing anymore.
[99:02.49]Yeah, I'm just enjoying the conversation at this point.
[99:06.79]I used to make a bit of Starcraft customs, but I never ventured over into Warcraft.
[99:13.62]Did you upload them or did you just kind of make them?
[99:19.18]I made them and I uploaded them.
[99:20.57]It's not like they got popular or anything.
[99:22.89]Oh.
[99:26.00]Because I made Warcraft 2 maps and Warcraft 3 maps, but I never ended up sharing them anywhere.
[99:31.03]I got pretty complicated with it.
[99:32.45]I remember trying to make some, like, pretty wild stuff.
[99:36.84]There was legitimate scripting in those editors.
[99:39.88]They were no joke.
[99:40.98]Yeah, they got crazy.
[99:43.98]I made some of those Starcraft, I forget what they were called, where you would just, like, move a Zergling through, like, the explosions.
[99:52.25]And you had to, like, time the explosions to get to the end.
[99:57.37]cool ever play this like Mario and luigi one where it's like each continent is like a Mario character no dude you play with their party is that's reminds me with your party yeah with their party it was good that one was awesome I have it I I downloaded almost all of these that we're talking about I just we just we have to pull the trigger on it one day you ever guys ever play I don't know what the name of the game is either where you like
[100:20.98]you get a constant stream of like marines or zerglings or whatever your like basic unit is and you have to like combine them on different pads there's like four pads and depending on the combo you get yes new units I love that I don't remember the name of that but I enjoyed that one footman wars was so much fun sounds like that dude kirby n64 game was amazing oh yeah that was fire that game is awesome the combining elements oh my god you could make the darth maul lightsaber in that game
[100:51.20]Well, yeah time to hit that well I think so folks build the next unction We're falling at that now Or if maybe there's like a yellow hell we can find I
[101:18.71]alright green hell yeah green hell again I I ain't gonna lie I laughed at the first hour of green hell I laughed I think harder than I have in the last like three or four weeks at least crocodile can we spawn in and run to it oh I'm gonna I'm gonna go watch your clip later you guys were even doing because I'm just like alone in the woods and you guys are all laughing wait you really you want to just spawn in to see the crocodile and that's it it takes so much work

[101:59.10]Are you guys still going?
[102:02.05]Who's still going?
[102:03.49]Probably not.
[102:04.01]No, I'm done.
[102:06.61]I'm thinking about it, but I'm not sure yet.
[102:09.00]No, you're going to pick RimWorld.
[102:10.04]Let's do it.
[102:11.71]I know, I do, but I also could... I've been streaming for four hours.
[102:15.22]I could use a little time off, too.
[102:17.00]If anything goes off, I'll eat a pizza.
[102:18.81]Poki, you still going, or are you done after this?
[102:22.35]Uh, yeah, maybe.
[102:23.63]I don't know.
[102:26.22]Everyone's so indecisive.
[102:28.18]Well, then, I won't raid any of you.
[102:31.52]Alright.
[102:32.05]Nice.
[102:32.29]That's fine.
[102:35.99]Perfect.
[102:36.23]None of you get a raid.
[102:39.02]But, yeah.

[102:52.86]Yeah, I'll do Dreamcore this week.
[102:55.85]This week coming up.
[102:57.47]Scrandle.
[102:58.15]Yeah, write all these down.
[103:00.07]Remind me of these.
[103:00.63]I want to remember these.
[103:03.82]That was fun though.
[103:04.48]I just figured it's been about four hours.
[103:07.10]I don't really know if I want to start anything else right now for like an hour or two.
[103:11.89]What about ToeJam & Earl?
[103:13.91]Alright, yeah, let's do it.
[103:16.61]What about Indiana Jones?
[103:17.78]Alright, yeah, let's do it.
[103:27.73]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[103:30.39]I'm hungry too.
[103:32.59]I'm gonna eat something.
[103:34.61]Take care of yourselves, thanks for watching.
[103:35.83]You will see this stream again...
[103:39.87]on Saturday.
[103:42.23]Me and Ster didn't even talk about it, but Ster and I are going to play Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 remake.
[103:50.57]And, you want to know something cool about that?
[103:54.67]Sponsored to play it.
[103:56.44]Isn't that fucking cool?
[103:59.02]Stern I gonna play a couple things on Saturday.
[104:01.31]We're gonna do Tony Hawk three and four and then We're gonna play do you guys remember?
[104:08.73]Dark Alliance Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance
[104:16.30]Ster and I are going to just chill after the Tony Hawk segment, which I don't know.
[104:20.81]I mean, it just depends on how much fun we have with Tony Hawk.
[104:24.07]We might play it for a while.
[104:26.22]But after the Tony Hawk segment, we're going to play some Dark Alliance.
[104:32.66]Some more nostalgia gaming.
[104:35.25]And I think that's going to be more of just kind of a hangout, chill kind of session where we're just playing it.
[104:40.71]So it should be fun.
[104:42.95]I've been thinking about playing it for a long time.
[104:45.25]Holly and I played it not that long ago.
[104:48.24]And I forgot just how fun it was.
[104:50.50]It was fun just to play it.
[104:53.81]Yeah.
[104:54.43]See you Saturday.
[104:55.61]Take care of yourselves.
[104:56.41]See you soon.
[104:57.73]Call your mother.
[104:58.47]You know the whole thing.
[105:05.16]Watch the clip.
[105:06.10]Okay, hold on.
[105:06.46]Let me see the clip.
[105:11.94]Let me get this.
[105:13.32]So this is the clip that Poke was laughing at?
[105:15.56]Alright, hold on a second.
[105:18.63]Hold on a second.
[105:19.33]Let me get it over here.
[105:27.63]This is THE clip.
[105:32.58]Give me a sec.
[105:39.79]That game's fun.
[105:40.29]I forgot how fun Lethal League was.
[105:47.14]Okay, so this is Poke's perspective, and this is the clip of the crocodile apparently killing me.
[105:54.59]Find out.
[105:59.66]What?
[106:00.80]You, what?
[106:01.90]Scorpion, on the floor.
[106:03.09]Scorpion.
[106:04.95]I'm poisoned.
[106:07.63]God, this is my alcoholic character, I swear to God, man.
[106:11.02]We need to make you an anti-venom.
[106:12.32]I'm on top of him!
[106:13.10]I'm on top of him!
[106:15.78]What is happening down there?
[106:23.25]What is going on?
[106:25.53]I've never heard him laugh like that.
[106:28.50]Okay.
[106:29.62]That was pretty funny.
[106:35.37]This is my alcoholic character, I swear to God.
[106:37.57]It was pretty good.
[106:38.17]It was good.
[106:39.65]I'm on top of him.
[106:40.72]I'm on top of him.
[106:41.62]I'm on top of him.
[106:42.68]Why do I sound like a weirdo?
[106:47.77]What is happening?
[106:48.87]Yeah, it really is like a baby tantrum.
[107:00.27]That's so funny.
[107:02.77]Down there.
[107:04.59]Alright, one more time, one more time.
[107:12.08]What is happening down there?
[107:14.49]Vinny's reaction is great, too.
[107:16.59]What is happening down there?
[107:18.39]Alright.
[107:27.98]I'll see you guys later.
[107:28.96]Take care.

[107:37.53]So we're going to get to those as well.
[107:40.51]See you Saturday.
[107:42.51]Bye, Tom.
[108:04.60]you
