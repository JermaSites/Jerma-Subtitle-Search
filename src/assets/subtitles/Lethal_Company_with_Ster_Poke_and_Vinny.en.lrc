[00:22.28]Hey, everybody.
[00:25.54]Currently, this is going to be very quick.
[00:27.78]We're ready to go, essentially.
[00:29.84]How you doing?
[00:32.36]Good to see you.
[00:33.04]We're five minutes early instead of being 45 minutes late.
[00:39.95]We got Vinny.
[00:41.61]We got Poke.
[00:42.89]And we got Ster.
[00:45.11]Lethal Company.
[00:49.29]Never played it before.
[00:50.85]No idea what's going on.
[00:55.11]I did hear that it's, it's, it's quite a, it's quite a scary game.
[00:59.10]It's quite a fun experience is what I've heard.
[01:00.80]Uh, go, I'm going no cam too.
[01:06.74]I want to get totally immersed.
[01:08.46]Maybe I'll turn it on later, but I'm going no cam to start.
[01:11.44]Alright, ready?
[01:20.00]We're ready.
[01:20.36]We're ready to go.
[01:23.68]Ah, who cares?
[01:25.94]Okay.
[01:27.02]I'll fix it.
[01:28.02]I'll fix it right now.
[01:29.02]No, you're good.
[01:29.52]You're good.
[01:30.12]Are we good?
[01:30.98]How's everybody doing?
[01:33.18]Holy shit.
[01:34.40]Alright.
[01:36.46]Yeah, but hey, my resolution sucks.
[01:38.02]It's our A. I'm playing on a giant fucking television, alright?
[01:40.51]Everybody relax.
[01:43.03]So, so Polk, did you hear Jerma's microphone just now?
[01:46.93]Yes.
[01:47.93]Was it weird for you or was that just me?
[01:51.41]I mean, it's Jerva.
[01:52.90]Jerva, talk.
[01:53.40]Hey, what's up?
[01:54.36]You went a little robot for a second, too.
[01:57.58]No, I think that just sounds normal.
[01:59.24]It's just maybe sometimes.
[01:59.90]Once in a while, a game gets robo for me.
[02:02.10]Like, robo once in a while.
[02:03.10]Yeah, you're robo right now for me.
[02:05.52]Oh, man.
[02:05.84]But not anymore.
[02:07.16]I think it's intended to be, like, poopy sometimes.
[02:09.77]Well, it's creepy.
[02:12.67]It's deliberate?
[02:13.59]Really?
[02:14.55]Yeah.
[02:15.73]Huh.
[02:17.25]Where's, uh... Where's the other guy?
[02:22.37]Oh, yeah.
[02:24.79]Ster, Ster.
[02:28.67]Where's the other guy?
[02:29.61]Alright, so Poke, you play this game a lot.
[02:37.28]No, I actually play it very little bit.
[02:38.72]I have no idea.
[02:40.17]Oh, really?
[02:41.79]Yeah.
[02:44.01]I've literally seen you play this.
[02:47.03]Yeah, didn't you play it last night?
[02:48.89]Yeah, no, we just could never get a lobby going.
[02:51.35]It was just sitting here waiting.
[02:52.59]Has Ster played this?
[02:58.81]I guess we'll find out.
[02:59.63]Let me invite him again.
[03:00.69]Vinny, you have no time for this, right?
[03:03.15]Zero.
[03:03.57]This is first.
[03:05.63]We're new.
[03:06.59]We're new.
[03:08.23]And this game blew up.
[03:09.15]It's got like 100,000 concurrent players.
[03:11.35]It's so weird.
[03:11.83]It's more than Starfield.
[03:13.23]Wow.
[03:13.41]Damn.
[03:15.61]Damn.
[03:17.79]Chat, we're keeping this vanilla today.
[03:20.09]We may eventually do non-vanilla and expand the lobby and get different suits, but today this is pure vanilla, whatever this game is called, legal company.
[03:31.45]Lethal.
[03:32.79]So what's in here?
[03:33.43]It's played by one guy, and of course it's a furry, so it's going to be a very good game.
[03:37.41]Oh, okay.
[03:38.63]Alright.
[03:44.47]So, Polk, what are some do's and don'ts?
[03:52.30]I'll tell you after we go to the bathroom in one second.
[03:56.23]Oh!
[03:56.35]I turned the lights off.
[03:57.07]I'm using the bathroom right now.
[03:59.13]How do I turn the lights back on?
[04:03.35]Where's that on the wall?
[04:04.09]It's somewhere on the wall.

[05:36.40]I'm being prepared for it.
[05:37.32]There's like Freddy Fazbear when he comes at you.
[05:39.72]It gets pretty loud.
[05:40.80]Have you seen the movie?
[05:41.72]I can hear my voice through someone's mic.
[05:44.28]Is it me?

[16:18.78]I jumped off.
[16:20.32]I didn't know it was like a hundred foot drop.
[16:22.14]I jumped off over the banister when the thing was chasing me and I fell like a hundred feet.

[17:46.95]No.
[17:50.27]No, I'm letting you guys do the work because you're like ensigns.
[17:54.47]Actually, it goes the other way.

[23:34.89]Dude, this is going to be a huge haul.
[23:37.04]How come every time I come back, you also come back?
[23:39.52]I don't know, because it's scary.
[23:40.48]I don't want to get killed by something.
[23:41.48]I don't know what's in this game.
[23:44.96]This ain't a game, bud.

[24:00.56]Okay, um, I have... What did I just pick up?
[24:03.24]I got a Rubik's Cube.
[24:04.89]Do you think I could be... Do you see in the corner of the room, the red door?
[24:07.53]Yeah.
[24:07.83]As well?
[24:08.93]Yep.
[24:09.11]That's, uh, there's a fire exit on all levels.
[24:11.51]Okay.
[24:12.39]Um... It's a second exit.
[24:15.33]Uh... You're gonna get lit up by that thing.
[24:20.02]Warning, increased levels of radiation.
[24:21.82]Okay.
[24:23.30]Let's get out the door.
[24:24.92]What door?
[24:27.68]Okay, I got the tea kettle.

[24:49.11]Are they okay?
[24:51.55]We can check when we get back.
[24:55.79]We can see where they are on the ship map.
[25:03.78]I don't know how we're going to get back.
[25:05.06]We like walked down a cliff.
[25:06.84]Wait, can we not get back up that way?
[25:09.98]The emergency exit might have been better.
[25:11.96]We can probably go this way.
[25:15.51]I love how the hall is pickles and beer.
[25:19.76]What do I got?
[25:20.14]No, I got a Rubik's Cube.
[25:21.42]I got a teapot, pickles, and a Rubik's Cube.
[25:23.91]Don't watch out for the bees.
[25:25.05]Watch out!
[25:25.47]Oh!

[26:50.08]How do I get on the ship?
[26:50.92]How do I get on the ship?
[26:51.68]How do I get on the ship?
[26:52.54]How do I get on the ship?
[26:53.16]Alright, I'm on the ship.

[27:15.35]Okay.
[27:15.83]Alright.
[27:16.29]Alright.
[27:16.63]Should we just drop this stuff inside?
[27:19.03]Yeah.
[27:24.29]Ooh.
[27:25.09]Got scrap.
[27:25.81]Rubik's Cube.
[27:27.02]That's worth something.
[27:29.00]What's that worth?
[27:29.74]Yeah, if you scan here, it'll show you the total.
[27:31.76]We got 264 already.
[27:33.59]Nice.
[27:33.85]Alright, so let's get could we call them?
[27:36.05]Yeah, here you check the you switch the camera.
[27:40.57]Oh, they're alive.
[27:41.13]Yeah, they're good.
[27:41.67]The red dot you see that coming at him that they're getting attacked.
[27:44.47]Should we help them?
[27:46.27]We can't.
[27:46.77]We don't normally if we have money we can get a teleporter and we could teleport them back to save them.
[27:51.46]Do we leave?
[27:52.28]They drop everything though.
[27:54.18]I think looks like he died.
[27:56.18]Oh no, are they just right out here?
[27:59.05]No, they're in the base somewhere.
[28:00.39]Oh no.
[28:04.33]You just scanned it.
[28:05.61]Wait, what happened?
[28:10.07]They just scanned it so we can figure out what's killing him.
[28:15.40]Monitoring bug.
[28:17.04]Yeah, he's being chased.
[28:18.42]It's literally like a game of fucking.
[28:21.24]This is like an Atari games.
[28:24.03]That aren't very.
[28:24.81]They're not hostile unless you take their thing.
[28:29.07]I think they're fighting.
[28:29.95]I think Vinny took its thing.
[28:34.63]But we could we could wait for poke to get back or we can we can go grab more.
[28:38.83]There was a lot more.
[28:39.93]Yeah, there's some stuff in the main entrance.
[28:42.23]There's some really scary stuff out here though.
[28:46.14]Uh, do you want to make money or you want to fucking cry and wet your pants, your little diaper, your little baby?
[28:50.58]Do you want to cry and wet your little diaper?
[28:52.32]This is enough.
[28:53.24]This is like, this is enough, isn't it?
[28:54.92]For level one?
[28:56.82]It's getting late.
[28:57.54]Yeah, but the more that we get, the more flashlights and stuff we can get.
[29:00.44]How, what time is it?
[29:02.64]Isn't it like eight o'clock at night?

[29:07.82]Are the creepers going to come out at 10 o'clock or something?
[29:11.48]Poke is dead.
[29:12.44]Oh no.
[29:13.47]Oh, he's not.
[29:13.93]Oh my god.
[29:14.69]Okay.
[29:15.39]Wait, no.
[29:15.85]Poke might be dead.
[29:18.41]Wait.
[29:19.67]Do you hear a scream?
[29:21.30]Scream?
[29:22.20]No.
[29:22.36]I think Poke's dead.
[29:34.07]Is that you?
[29:34.63]Is that you walking around?
[29:35.71]No, get inside.
[29:36.53]Get inside.
[29:37.11]Is that you?
[29:37.59]I heard something walking around.
[29:38.51]Something was just walking around.
[29:39.84]We're leaving.
[29:40.68]We're leaving, but... Is that... Did we get money?
[29:43.70]Did they get money?
[29:44.56]Look at the map.
[29:45.12]Do you see that big red?
[29:46.38]Uh-huh.
[29:46.96]Do you see how big that is?
[29:48.94]Uh-huh.
[29:49.76]Do you see the situation?
[29:52.41]Which one of those is us?
[29:53.93]Oh.
[29:54.61]We're the little blue circles.
[29:57.19]Oh.
[29:57.43]So there's something horrible out here.
[29:58.83]Do you want to go out there?
[30:01.23]What if you just open the door?
[30:02.11]What happens?
[30:06.66]You can go investigate.
[30:07.50]I just want to see money if we don't recover your body.
[30:11.04]I just want to see it.
[30:17.41]Yeah, that's funny.
[30:18.23]Really funny.
[30:21.95]Oh I got killed.
[30:27.51]Good one, good one, good one.
[30:28.43]Let's go.
[30:33.35]Then we made some money though.
[30:34.49]That's good.
[30:35.64]Yeah, that was a good run.
[30:36.89]That was a nice haul.
[30:40.59]Cool.
[30:44.17]Proud of you.
[30:45.59]Dude, I can't wait to pick all four streams and watch every perspective and see what the heck happened out there.
[30:55.84]The laziest employee.
[30:57.26]Why?
[30:58.34]Jarmo, it was bad out there, buddy.
[31:00.16]It was bad.
[31:01.63]Oh, man.
[31:03.46]You wouldn't even know the horrors that we faced in those corridors.
[31:07.50]The only thing we had to deal with was a beehive.
[31:09.52]We were like in a Winnie the Pooh episode.
[31:12.24]We had to make a bargain with the monster and give up a... What was it?
[31:15.42]A brush?
[31:16.22]We gave up... First, you gave him a key, and then I tried to give a brush, and then we died anyway because we couldn't find our way out.
[31:23.95]Yeah, we got a lot of stuff, though.
[31:25.63]We were way over quota.
[31:27.97]We did get a lot of good stuff.
[31:30.30]It's a shame, too, because we took a light source that could have been worth a ton, and... Oh, the generator.
[31:36.48]The generator, but it cut the lights, which is why we got lost.
[31:39.14]And then my battery died.
[31:40.56]That actually helped us, because we were in a room with a turret, and you turned the power off.
[31:44.90]Oh, is that what happened?
[31:46.56]Oh, shit.
[31:47.00]People saying, buy walkie-talkies.
[31:52.09]How much money we got?
[31:52.85]We have $10, and it is... Yeah, we need to... We have no money.
[31:58.23]We have no money.
[31:59.28]This one is just gonna be, uh, we gotta go to an easy moon.
[32:01.62]Get as much money as we can.
[32:03.92]We have one flashlight.
[32:04.84]That's fine.
[32:05.32]Uh, how do I charge the flashlight?
[32:09.26]Oh, right here.
[32:14.44]Oh, Jesus.
[32:15.30]That scared the fuck out of me.
[32:19.14]So why Jerry?
[32:21.32]Uh, Jerry.
[32:22.99]Jerry was a race car driver.
[32:30.66]That's cool.
[32:31.16]Does anybody else want to take the flashlight?
[32:33.32]What the fuck?
[32:34.16]What just happened?
[32:34.60]Yeah, that was weird.
[32:35.18]You can move that?
[32:38.08]Whoa.
[32:39.30]Whoa!
[32:41.28]Hey, cut it out!
[32:43.84]The feng shui is just not good here right now.
[32:47.01]Yeah, this is not... I don't... I don't... You need to chill.
[32:56.04]I'm trying to return these to their natural position so we can get good cheat.
[33:00.42]Come on!
[33:00.88]We got a prankster on board.
[33:02.44]You can move the switch away.
[33:04.46]Alright, so what moon?
[33:09.80]Where are we going?
[33:11.72]Cut it out!
[33:14.89]We went to a Val.
[33:16.07]Uh oh.
[33:17.71]This is bad.
[33:18.31]What's bad?
[33:22.53]Just look at all of them.
[33:24.45]Huh?
[33:25.54]Just look at him.
[33:26.18]Look at the reports on the computer.
[33:28.06]Look at the reports.
[33:31.24]Oh, man.
[33:31.94]Population abandoned.
[33:33.56]It's humid and windy.
[33:35.14]Hazard level C. Humid and windy?
[33:37.74]I think this is going to be okay as long as there's no spiders here.
[33:44.10]I can't see.
[33:44.90]It's hazy, too.
[33:47.21]It's a little too hazy.
[33:49.27]I couldn't see the ground, but there is ground.
[33:51.81]Be careful because you could just fall and die here.
[33:54.83]What?
[33:55.65]That's not good.
[33:57.33]And we can't see more than three feet in front of us.
[33:59.41]I don't like that.
[34:00.33]Hold hands.
[34:00.87]Hold hands.
[34:01.27]Get a leash.
[34:02.71]Don't go too far.
[34:03.31]You're just wandering in a random direction.
[34:05.71]What?
[34:05.95]What?
[34:06.13]What?
[34:06.45]Oh, is that you?
[34:08.69]I'm making a noise.
[34:10.31]Oh, I lost you already.
[34:11.33]There you are.
[34:14.79]Uh-oh.
[34:16.75]I'm falling in something.
[34:17.55]Looks like a way down.
[34:22.38]I don't know where I am.
[34:23.16]This is just mist.
[34:24.82]I can't see anything.
[34:25.84]I think we went in the wrong direction.
[34:27.49]I don't know.
[34:28.97]No, big hair.
[34:31.13]Sorry.
[34:32.33]Oh, God.
[34:32.89]No, we're going to be just fine.
[34:33.87]I know we are.
[34:36.27]We're going in circles.
[34:37.23]Don't fall down here.
[34:38.05]Just be careful.
[34:39.23]How are we going to find our way back to our ship?
[34:42.45]Just scan.
[34:43.13]Wait, Polk, where'd you go?
[34:44.03]Oh, the scan.
[34:44.71]That's right.
[34:45.13]There's a ship scan.
[34:46.23]Okay.
[34:46.87]The ship shows up.
[34:47.49]You do still have to kind of be near it.
[34:49.23]Oh, there.
[34:49.87]Polk?
[34:50.17]Yep.
[34:51.65]Hello?
[34:52.27]Where'd you go?
[34:52.69]This way?
[34:53.91]I'm like right here.
[34:55.45]Poke, are you down or up?
[34:57.38]I don't know.
[34:57.92]I don't know.
[34:58.60]I don't know.
[35:00.56]Oh, there you are.
[35:01.38]Oh, I see.
[35:01.86]Poke is in a crevasse.
[35:03.24]Wait, can you see the light?
[35:04.74]This could be a bad crevasse though.
[35:07.30]This looks like a bad crevasse.
[35:09.08]Oh, hey.
[35:09.34]Yeah, this is a diff crevasse.
[35:12.95]Any shit on the ground?
[35:13.67]We went like totally the wrong way.
[35:16.93]Okay.
[35:17.25]Let me try signaling the moon.
[35:19.62]That shit's going to run out of batteries.
[35:21.56]I have 100%.
[35:22.38]Past this tree, perhaps?
[35:29.08]Where we were before?
[35:30.30]I'm past the tree.
[35:35.54]You're like mom before going to the airport.
[35:37.80]How much battery percentage do you have?
[35:39.08]98%.
[35:40.16]That's not enough.
[35:42.42]Okay, you can see where the ship is with a scan.
[35:44.88]We went in a circle.
[35:45.96]Oh, got it.
[35:46.50]Where is everybody?
[35:47.44]I don't think we can climb up there, though, no?
[35:51.74]Oh.
[35:52.94]Hello, Jerry.
[35:54.06]We're fine.
[35:55.34]But we, uh, poke, Ster?
[35:58.38]Uh-oh.
[36:00.06]Oh, I don't like the sound of that.
[36:01.64]Uh... Poke!
[36:03.50]Ster!
[36:07.04]Look for the bat signal!
[36:10.35]Guys?
[36:11.49]Guys!
[36:13.35]Uh... That's bad.
[36:14.05]I don't know.
[36:15.47]Alright.
[36:17.35]What the fuck was that?
[36:18.27]Uh...
[36:19.61]Shit.
[36:20.71]I just heard let go.
[36:21.43]This is where we were.
[36:22.29]That's a circle.
[36:23.03]That's a circle.
[36:23.71]Okay.
[36:26.73]Maybe this way.
[36:27.49]Maybe this way.
[36:28.09]Maybe this way.
[36:30.45]I found a rock.
[36:32.13]Found more rocks.
[36:33.05]Okay.
[36:33.49]Rocks.
[36:34.63]We're going down, it looks like.
[36:36.05]The ship is... We're going to the ship.
[36:41.92]That's good.
[36:43.16]Hey.
[36:44.66]Look at the signal.
[36:47.20]I can't see it.
[36:47.94]I can't see it.
[36:52.45]Is poke here?
[36:53.87]He went off in another direction.
[36:56.17]I don't know how he moved this here.
[36:57.87]Come over here.
[36:58.29]You can charge your flashlight in this.
[37:03.03]You press B to move it.
[37:07.24]So we just walked in a giant circle and lost poke.
[37:11.76]Alright, here everyone.
[37:13.82]This direction.
[37:15.65]Let's just walk.
[37:16.81]Straight line.
[37:17.37]And let's harmonize our voices to make the echo go much further so Poe can hear us.
[37:22.35]Okay.
[37:23.35]We'll do some harmonies.
[37:25.11]Do you want to go low or do you want to go high?
[37:26.49]Vinny?
[37:30.05]I don't know.
[37:30.55]I don't know, man.
[37:31.75]Hallelujah.
[37:34.15]Hallelujah.
[37:35.61]Cliff?
[37:36.51]Beware of Cliff.
[37:39.42]Hello?
[37:40.22]Yep, we're here.
[37:41.66]I'm ready to leave.
[37:42.94]I hate this.
[37:45.04]This is the worst planet of all time.
[37:47.34]Are we missing an item to clear this or something?
[37:51.16]Poke!
[37:52.78]Oh, can you hear us?
[37:57.18]Where are you?
[37:57.58]Where are you?
[37:59.94]The water.
[38:00.44]I hear you.
[38:01.89]You're down a cliff, man.
[38:03.01]Can you see the light?
[38:10.63]I might just die, guys.
[38:14.10]You good?
[38:15.86]No.
[38:18.76]Of course not.
[38:21.02]Hey, man, we're going to throw some Doritos down there in a small sub.
[38:25.33]You'll be alright.
[38:27.95]Just go on without me.
[38:29.57]If you don't hear me in four seconds, I'm dead.
[38:34.29]Oh, hot.
[38:35.60]Hey!
[38:36.68]I think I fell down here with you.

[39:18.92]How do I get out?
[39:21.00]How do I get out of the water?

[40:41.62]Worst planet.
[40:43.98]But we have enough money.
[40:45.80]We did it!

[42:00.05]Try to get the exact amount so you have more money for next quota, says a chat member.
[42:06.31]You gotta ding the bell.
[42:11.41]But also the money that we could get to buy us flashlights.
[42:14.33]Can you fix the the visor at some point too?
[42:16.91]What's that noise?
[42:19.37]What is that?

[43:54.62]I let him do it, though.
[43:55.64]He won.
[43:56.08]Can you move the computer away from him?
[43:59.24]I already got one walkie-talkie, so if you get more... Here.
[44:05.14]Vinny, can you put Markiplier in the corner for engagement?
[44:11.96]Just like a realistic Markiplier VTuber that you just have there.
[44:15.80]And thens like MrBeast's smiley face.
[44:18.97]Guys, I dealt with Ster.
[44:21.11]I'm learning.

[45:11.51]Okay.
[45:14.09]I mean, I kind of stepped in.
[45:15.52]I didn't know what was happening.
[45:17.92]I just heard a loud noise.
[45:18.92]I looked up and it's just bright.
[45:25.30]Is he trying to sell Jerma?
[45:27.46]What?
[45:28.00]Yeah.
[45:29.36]You got to press the bell a bunch of times.
[45:31.40]Am I worth it?
[45:32.13]Am I worth it?
[45:33.89]I know what that does and I'm not going to do it.
[45:35.61]Sorry.
[45:36.72]What do you mean?
[45:37.90]I know what happens.
[45:39.21]Why did it come back twice?
[45:42.53]That's inefficient.
[45:43.31]You could have put that in one package.
[45:45.03]I don't think they want him.
[45:46.73]They want him.
[45:47.33]Trust me.
[45:47.73]Give him a minute.
[45:52.01]OK, they.
[45:53.37]Wait.
[45:54.47]I took him.
[45:55.31]Yeah, it's gone.
[45:56.19]He's just worthless.
[45:58.41]So now what?
[46:03.71]Did they turn me into like juice back there?
[46:05.49]Uh, do you guys got, how many walkies are there?
[46:07.93]What happens to me?
[46:09.82]I have.
[46:14.64]Monitoring Jerry.
[46:17.96]Uh, do we want more stuff or you just want to go?
[46:19.62]I think we're good.
[46:21.62]Maybe one shovel to deal with that parasite thing, but maybe, I don't know.
[46:26.74]You know what I mean?
[46:27.49]One shovel while we're here.
[46:29.63]Yeah.
[46:31.99]Oh, wait, I'm just dead.
[46:44.56]You were abandoned.
[46:45.58]Oh, when they leave, okay.
[46:55.19]Alright.
[46:57.17]Ready to go, boys.
[46:57.99]Round it up.
[46:59.49]Beep-a-da-boop-bop-bop-ba-boop.
[47:01.83]It's a respectful inventory.
[47:06.47]Alright, so how do you do this?
[47:11.32]So you go moons?
[47:13.28]Yep.
[47:14.42]And then... Uh-oh.
[47:19.10]What's the word route to learn about moons?
[47:25.00]Rend.
[47:26.23]Hey, you might have to move me.
[47:28.23]Dude, when I come back, it's already watching.
[47:29.47]It's going to be really funny.
[47:31.70]Nice.
[47:33.30]Hey, you're back.
[47:33.82]We heard you.
[47:34.34]Dude, oh!
[47:36.68]I can't... Ooh, $12.
[47:40.38]It's not moving.
[47:41.44]Uh-oh.
[47:46.67]Oh, thank God.
[47:47.61]Oh, there you go.
[47:48.05]I just pressed the wrong button.
[47:50.61]That is scary.
[47:52.47]The cause of the route to 61 March is zero.
[47:55.42]It is currently mild weather on this moon.
[47:57.12]Is that where we just were or no?
[47:58.54]No, we were on a different one.
[47:59.56]That sounds good.
[48:02.25]It doesn't matter.
[48:04.85]How do you use the walkie talkie?
[48:06.37]Oh, like this?
[48:07.46]Top right of your screen has all of the buttons in turn.
[48:11.78]OK, so is it a push to hold or push to talk?
[48:14.68]You gotta turn it on.
[48:17.62]And then you hold the button to talk.
[48:21.04]And if you don't say over, you get fired.
[48:22.88]OK.
[48:24.48]OK, over.
[48:27.52]Try it out.
[48:29.02]Where's my walkie?
[48:30.04]Trying it out over.
[48:33.11]uh hello over hey over you hear me over this is under over over okay so here's the thing you imagine you drop these they're they're worth like we paid for them my flashlight is still somewhere in that place where we die yeah I gotta I need you guys to be careful so who's using the shovel
[48:59.40]What's the shovel do?
[49:01.00]I don't know.
[49:02.28]What can you actually kill with the shovel?
[49:05.82]Like that thing that killed Jerma?
[49:07.60]Or Mini?
[49:09.78]The head thing?
[49:10.90]One of you guys take it.
[49:12.14]I'll be the melee fighter.
[49:13.58]Did you pick the moon?
[49:15.24]I'll be the melee fighter.
[49:16.72]I pressed it and then something happened, but I don't know what's going on.
[49:19.49]Then you gotta land the ship.
[49:23.79]I'll be the melee fighter.
[49:26.33]Make sure you guys charge your stuff.
[49:27.39]The more items I have, the less inventory you have for valuables.
[49:31.33]I'm going to put the flashlight down.
[49:34.61]You have a flashlight and I don't have a walkie.
[49:37.25]I have a walkie, no flashlight, and the shovel.
[49:41.03]Hazard level B. What's better?
[49:44.64]Is the 2 better with the shovel or the 3?
[49:46.10]The whirlwind spin.
[49:50.38]What do you mean?
[49:52.34]Don't go down there, guys.
[49:53.12]They're dead.
[49:55.97]Oh, my.
[49:57.23]I'm glad I didn't jump down there.
[49:59.39]It's not me and you this time.
[50:01.20]Hey, I see you guys fell down.
[50:05.00]Over.
[50:05.16]I see a dead body.
[50:09.32]Over.
[50:10.30]Oh, they're actually dead.
[50:11.18]Are they dead?
[50:17.45]We didn't last really fast.
[50:19.23]We didn't even last 10 seconds.
[50:21.74]Oh my fucking god.
[50:23.10]Alright, well, can we at least go get like a burrito on the ground or something?
[50:27.24]Can we get one thing?
[50:28.10]Let's just speedrun it.
[50:29.42]Five seconds.
[50:29.96]Okay.

[50:49.84]I'm sorry.
[50:50.26]I have high blood pressure.
[50:52.00]I can't play this game.
[50:57.66]It's just me.
[51:03.19]Alright.
[51:03.49]Alright.
[51:03.79]Alright.
[51:04.03]Alright.
[51:09.65]So we just got to get like one thing.
[51:11.01]Something valuable.
[51:12.81]Load.
[51:15.30]What the heck?
[51:16.14]What is it?
[51:17.80]It's weird.
[51:25.94]Be careful.
[51:27.80]There's like bombs in here.
[51:28.82]There's bombs in there?
[51:29.94]Yeah, landmines.
[51:32.62]Oh god, that's not good.
[51:34.39]Let's check up here.

[51:58.15]Where?
[51:58.75]You have any space for the sheet right here?
[52:00.17]I got one.
[52:00.99]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[52:01.63]Got it.
[52:02.61]Alright, let's get out of here.
[52:06.57]Oh, my God.
[52:10.34]Be careful.
[52:15.51]Alright, we made it.
[52:16.31]Nice.
[52:16.59]Okay, we actually have stuff.
[52:22.47]They're gonna be so proud of us.
[52:23.53]Watch out for those bugs.
[52:28.33]I'm very heavy.
[52:37.52]Yeah, me too.
[52:39.34]I'm 38 pounds.
[52:39.82]I'm 45 pounds.
[52:44.01]Yeah, that's awful.
[52:44.77]Grown-ass pounds.
[52:48.53]Wait, that hurts you.
[52:50.81]I hit you in the back of the head with a shovel.
[52:52.42]I was just seeing what happened.
[52:54.06]I'm sorry, but I won't say it again, okay?
[53:08.39]The rumors are true about you, ma'am.
[53:10.83]I'm sorry.
[53:19.20]cool okay nice alright let's just you want to get it out or I think we should just get out right yeah we should bring them back because we need to make fun of them for their failure it was a complete failure they voted to get out
[53:45.97]What the hell was that?
[53:46.73]It's so funny they died the same way we died.
[53:48.59]That's so funny.
[53:51.55]Dude, there was like an animal in here for a second.
[54:01.31]That was weird.
[54:02.55]Alright, so now we're... How did you make more money than us?
[54:05.43]That doesn't make any sense.
[54:08.43]You guys need to step it up.
[54:11.55]Yeah, turns out you can't swim.
[54:14.13]Yeah, we got two oxygen tanks on our back and we can't survive underwater for more than three seconds.
[54:23.69]I was one second away from hitting you with the shovel.
[54:25.61]I was about to hit him with the shovel.
[54:29.03]Yeah, I'm almost dead.
[54:29.99]I definitely should not have this because I'm going to comedy hit somebody and it's going to be bad for everything.
[54:35.10]Can you recharge health?
[54:38.50]In between missions?
[54:40.26]I don't know actually.
[54:41.06]I think you do automatically.
[54:43.50]I think when we land, your health will be back.
[54:48.12]Yeah, I profusely apologize.
[54:49.66]I mean, it's okay.
[54:52.26]Just check your DMs I sent you.
[54:54.22]Let me see.
[54:56.34]Oh, fuck.
[54:58.77]Oh, fuck, dude.
[55:01.25]Make sure all your stuff is charged.
[55:03.19]You can sleep on the bunk if you're injured, says a chat member.
[55:06.01]Oh.
[55:07.43]Oh, what?
[55:08.17]There's a bunk?
[55:09.25]You can sleep on the bunk.
[55:10.23]Bunk?
[55:11.23]Wait, really?
[55:15.26]I'm going to grab a walkie-talkie.
[55:16.71]I'm going to stay behind and give you guys advice from here because I don't have a flashlight or anything, so I'm going to be your guide.
[55:24.53]Okay.
[55:25.47]I'll have the walkie-talkie.
[55:28.23]Okay.
[55:28.81]Did you heal, Poke?
[55:29.55]I think only Poke has a walkie-talkie.
[55:31.88]I can't heal.
[55:32.40]Yeah, I don't know what to do with this either.
[55:35.74]Maybe the chat member lied.
[55:36.70]Shit, now I actually feel really bad about hitting you now.
[55:40.19]It's a scratch, man.
[55:41.65]It's nothing.
[55:42.85]Do you want to hit me?
[55:44.17]That's fair.
[55:47.09]There's like bees here, I think.
[55:48.51]Yeah, there's already bugs.
[55:53.73]What's happening?
[55:55.07]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[55:55.53]That was weird.
[55:56.47]What?
[55:56.89]Is it quicksand?
[55:57.47]I don't know.
[55:58.03]What was that?
[56:00.69]That was weird.
[56:04.14]Quicksand, quicksand, quicksand.
[56:05.46]I'm drowning.
[56:06.46]Hey, is this place flooded?
[56:10.00]Uh, it said rainy.
[56:11.08]It didn't say flooded.
[56:12.46]Where's Vinny?
[56:14.22]He needs to stay on the ship with Milwaukee.
[56:16.50]Oh, okay.
[56:17.10]You can see where items are on the ship so he can like tell us if we're near something.
[56:20.80]He, he... What's up, Vinny?
[56:22.52]Hey, uh, Vinny, can you do a quick scan on the computer and tell us what you see?
[56:29.37]Just type scan.
[56:36.29]It's awfully quiet.
[56:37.05]What do we got?
[56:40.03]We're really gonna have to get a new guy this guy Roger that we're gonna be turning off the walkie-talkie for a minute to save battery.
[56:52.65]I'll see you in a minute Are we not
[57:11.27]I got the shovel in case things get a little hairy.
[57:15.62]I see a bolt.

[57:37.35]You can drop it off?
[57:37.87]Alright, we're going to be right in here.
[57:41.26]Nah, we think we got that place.
[57:43.46]Oh, there's a big thing right here.

[58:42.50]What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?
[59:06.55]That bug might come take our shit.

[59:11.05]Yeah, what do you need?
[59:11.91]Open that door.
[59:12.55]Go straight.
[59:21.70]There's a bug in here.
[59:22.74]How do I close?
[59:25.18]Look out, look out, look out, dude.
[59:26.26]There's a giant spider over there.
[59:27.74]You're the one with the shovel.
[59:29.64]I have a shovel, not a machine gun.
[59:35.56]Are you scared?
[59:36.62]Hey, uh, no.
[59:37.50]Of course not, man.
[59:38.56]I'm the muscle.
[59:39.28]It's me.
[59:41.26]I saw how you picked that thing up.
[59:42.42]That thing must have been like 300 pounds.
[59:45.20]Should I attack this thing?
[59:49.14]Do whatever you feel is best.
[59:50.66]I don't know what's best.
[59:51.87]Scan it.
[59:54.05]You got a walkie?
[59:55.31]I do have a walkie.
[59:56.87]Bunker spider.
[59:57.75]Call it in.
[59:58.61]Call it in.
[60:01.31]Hey, Vinny or Poke, I've got a bunker spider down here in the bunker and I just want to know if you could look that up and let me know where I should hit this motherfucker.
[60:15.33]Say the whole thing again?
[60:16.05]You want me to repeat the whole thing?
[60:25.36]Hey, anyone there?
[60:26.97]Yeah, yeah, over here.
[60:28.34]There's a bunker spider down here.
[60:29.42]Hey, there's a bunker spider over here.
[60:31.06]Don't do that.
[60:38.48]Did I hit it?
[60:39.96]Is it dead?
[60:40.42]I think it's if you piss it off, it gets pissed type shit.
[60:43.73]Hey, hey, hey, hey, careful there, Buster.
[60:47.05]Hey, put the light on it for a second.
[60:50.85]Hey, hey, bunker spider, I got my mom on the phone.
[60:52.89]You got anything to say?
[60:53.85]I got my mom on the phone.
[60:54.73]Anything you got to say?
[61:02.90]Oh.
[61:03.26]Good job with that spider.
[61:06.01]Holy shit.
[61:08.91]Oh my god, I've never seen that.
[61:12.85]Jerma's dead, over.
[61:15.45]I don't know who he's talking to.
[61:16.61]Can you get him down?
[61:19.09]Oh shit, you died.
[61:20.11]Vinny, what happened to you?
[61:21.11]There's quicksand.
[61:24.03]My anger, it might... We gotta get him down!
[61:27.49]Just do it, keep hitting it.
[61:33.05]Hold on, I'm getting a grab prompt, but only sometimes.
[61:37.05]I can't get it.
[61:37.85]It's not working.
[61:38.55]Just whack it.
[61:39.05]You have to whack it.
[61:39.69]Wait, no, I think I have it.
[61:40.87]You got killed by the quicksand?
[61:42.09]I don't know.
[61:42.61]It's being weird.
[61:43.65]Yeah, I was trying to bring back one of those objects, and I was trying to avoid the locust, and there's quicksand.
[61:49.94]Oh, that's why you weren't responding.
[61:52.38]Okay, because we were trying to talk to you through the walkie.
[61:54.94]I was like, hey, give us some info about the bunker.
[61:57.32]That's so funny.
[62:04.13]They think you're alive.
[62:05.27]Yeah, we're not going this way.
[62:09.13]It's all webbed up.
[62:10.19]Like, there is no way you are dead to them.
[62:12.29]Like, it's impossible.
[62:13.77]Let me try the shovel.
[62:15.51]How could I be?
[62:19.88]They are just hitting me in the head over and over.
[62:21.74]I ain't going to wake up from this.
[62:24.57]This is just like... If I wasn't dead, I'm... This is like a break room.
[62:29.83]You just take out all your frustration.
[62:32.83]The spider's still not dead, by the way.
[62:35.19]I'm going to save you.
[62:37.98]No.
[62:38.12]I'm leaving.
[62:38.46]Where is the spider?
[62:39.54]I'm not leaving.
[62:40.12]I'm going to look for some shit.
[62:43.76]That's so funny.
[62:53.20]This game is insane.
[62:54.50]This game is outrageous.
[62:55.75]Yeah, it's really good.
[63:05.63]Yeah, this is the spider right there.
[63:07.25]The rest of the compound's behind him.
[63:09.11]What do you think Vinny's doing?
[63:13.18]Wait.
[63:14.08]Hey Vinny, what are you doing?
[63:15.12]I can't, I can't help him.
[63:17.92]You there?
[63:19.70]Are you able to clear the web with the shovel?
[63:21.58]Oh, they probably just think you don't know that the walkie talkie is off or something, right?
[63:25.11]Yeah, because that happened to me earlier.
[63:26.41]I was trying to talk to you guys and your walkie talkies were off.
[63:29.51]Oh my God.
[63:30.15]Why would he do that?
[63:31.37]He doesn't like that.
[63:32.11]I'm out.
[63:33.19]I'm out.
[63:33.63]I'm out.
[63:35.13]Are you good?
[63:38.12]He made it out.
[63:40.38]Yeah, yeah.
[63:40.88]I'm in the back over.
[63:41.66]That thing is running at him.
[63:43.58]It's coming back to me over.
[63:44.76]It's on me.
[63:49.71]Hey, I want to get around it.
[63:52.20]Yeah.
[63:53.94]I'm getting past it.
[63:56.60]We got a leaf back here.
[63:57.54]We can't see shit.
[63:58.26]Okay, it's on the left.
[63:59.80]I'm going to run to the right.
[64:01.56]I'm going for it.
[64:02.74]Are you sure?
[64:03.36]Here.
[64:03.64]Are you sure?
[64:04.96]Should I keep the walkie?
[64:06.11]Do you want it?
[64:07.53]Here, take it.
[64:09.33]Yeah, the running animation is so funny.
[64:12.39]Look, vote to leave early so that way they have to leave.
[64:16.33]It didn't move.
[64:17.57]He got by it.
[64:18.56]He got through it.
[64:19.93]Wow.
[64:20.88]Hello?
[64:22.14]Uh oh.
[64:33.27]Yeah, I'm out.
[64:35.29]I don't think Ster's getting back to the ship, Jerm.
[64:37.22]I don't think he is either.
[64:38.30]He's getting in a little too deep.
[64:43.56]Someone is going to poke or Ster on the way back to the ship is also going to die in the quicksand.
[64:48.90]It's going to happen.
[64:49.64]Perfect ending.
[64:53.64]Alright, poke's going for it.
[64:54.50]Let's see.
[64:58.70]Wait, he's going back.
[64:59.40]He's going back.
[65:01.46]Okay, here we go.
[65:02.06]Here we go.
[65:02.94]okay here we go is this is about where you died like I did he's gonna jump like I did yeah and then he's gonna go straight into the quicksand oh god isn't he don't do it don't do it it's right there it's right there that's the quicksand what
[65:35.43]What?!
[65:36.21]Yeah, that's how I died about five and a half minutes ago.
[65:39.44]Did I just drown?
[65:40.96]Yes, you did.
[65:41.56]That was quicksand.
[65:43.36]Oh, that's so funny.
[65:45.22]The reason why he wasn't talking to us through the walkie-talkie is because he died so fucking early.
[65:49.77]Oh.
[65:52.12]From the exact same way you did.
[65:56.18]And now Ster has no idea.
[65:57.58]Ster thinks you're completely safe.
[65:59.26]He's going to do the exact same thing on his way back.
[66:01.32]Yep.
[66:01.60]He's going to go straight to the quicksand, just like I did and you did.
[66:04.76]It's going to be wonderful.
[66:05.54]He thinks we're both alive, just living it up right now.
[66:10.53]What is this like nuclear reactor he's holding?
[66:14.35]So that's what we were trying to bring back earlier when we died to the spider.
[66:17.73]Almost midnight, man.
[66:24.51]He might pull this off, but he's probably just going to die to the quicksand.
[66:28.33]Yeah, he might not make it out of the building though.
[66:31.37]What time is it in the game?
[66:33.21]Fucking sucks.
[66:37.69]Ship leaving in one hour.
[66:40.86]Oh wait.
[66:42.62]Oh so he's gone.
[66:43.54]Yeah.
[66:50.51]Oh, no.
[66:52.05]Hey.
[66:55.27]Oh, man.
[66:56.49]Oh, Polk, you died?
[66:58.24]Yeah.
[67:00.06]So, Ster, there's quicksand.
[67:02.76]Yeah, there is.
[67:03.66]Yeah, there is.
[67:04.78]Yeah, that's how me and Polk died.
[67:06.10]They both died in the same exact way.
[67:07.18]You didn't get anything back?
[67:08.72]No, I tried to walk it back.
[67:10.02]I slow walked and I just drowned.
[67:12.36]Walked.
[67:14.07]Me and Jerma watched it happen and we were like it's gonna happen and he just went straight into the quicksand.
[67:20.42]It was wonderful.
[67:21.10]Yeah it was perfect.
[67:21.78]So we are out of flashlights and we are out of walkies and we have no shovel.
[67:26.72]We've lost everything.
[67:28.06]Well let's just go to the easy level and just go pick up a bunch of like tea kettles.
[67:31.89]This is the one day left quota easy day.
[67:34.21]We have to get 200 from this place.
[67:36.35]Get that finger out of my face.
[67:38.77]We can do it.
[67:39.03]I know we can do it.
[67:39.71]We can just grab a bunch of quick stuff.
[67:42.02]Quick mission in and out.
[67:43.08]Five minutes.
[67:43.62]Yeah.
[67:44.46]Okay.
[67:44.66]We're all going to sprint together.
[67:45.70]We're all going to run and pick up this stuff, run back, and deposit it.
[67:47.98]That's it.
[67:49.22]Yes.
[67:49.88]Yes.
[67:50.24]That's it.
[67:51.98]Okay.
[67:57.14]Don't do anything fancy.
[67:57.99]Just run in and run out.
[68:04.27]Oh.
[68:04.77]We have to take off.
[68:06.61]Or do we?
[68:13.94]I ordered one for... What the fuck happened to you?
[68:17.58]Did anybody hear that?
[68:21.06]Somebody unplugged him.
[68:25.28]I ordered one for... It's like somebody went in his room and like snapped his neck.
[68:32.50]Me?
[68:33.16]Yeah, that was crazy.
[68:34.90]My whole camera turned off.
[68:37.92]Okay, guys.
[68:38.80]Guys, guys, guys.
[68:39.64]Come here, come here, come here.
[68:40.78]Yo.

[68:44.57]Wait.
[68:46.55]Is there a way to... Hell?
[68:47.85]I think this one is raining.
[68:49.33]I think the rain does that.
[68:50.93]Okay, it's not rainy.
[68:51.75]You're right.
[68:52.15]Thank you.
[68:52.59]Sorry about that.
[68:59.15]I just know that it was like, um... There was like an incline, and then I just started drowning.
[69:04.22]There's an ice cream truck?
[69:04.98]You know what?
[69:05.28]Stuart can get those items.
[69:06.76]We've ordered.
[69:08.02]What's your ice cream from the ice cream truck?
[69:09.86]What do you get?
[69:10.26]Do you get the Spongebob?
[69:12.10]Or you get the ice cream sandwich?
[69:13.22]You get the soft serve?
[69:15.60]I would like some soft serve, like vanilla or chocolate.
[69:18.58]Just... Just... Bro, let's go.
[69:21.36]We gotta hurry.
[69:22.66]Guys, this is it.
[69:23.70]We're gonna be fired if we don't do this.
[69:25.20]Did you Uber eat something to the house and not ask anybody if they want anything?
[69:31.14]Let's get some stuff.
[69:32.98]I got the only flashlight.
[69:35.75]Okay, Wacky.

[69:50.32]Wait, who are you talking about?
[69:53.54]Oh, God.

[71:14.37]Run!
[71:15.43]Run!
[71:20.16]We were supposed to run.
[71:21.28]He's really hurt.
[71:22.02]I had him, I whacked him in the head like eight times.
[71:29.65]I will finish his job.
[71:31.45]At least bring the sign back and get like four bucks.
[71:41.39]It's nice knowing you guys.
[71:46.21]Where are you?
[71:46.65]Hello?
[71:47.67]I don't know where I am.
[71:48.25]I'm stuck in a web.
[71:48.97]I'm stuck in a web.
[71:49.57]Luigi!
[71:51.05]He's stuck in a whip!
[71:52.15]He's standing up and it's weird!
[71:54.97]Oh!
[71:57.16]Jesus!
[71:57.62]I killed it!
[71:58.16]I killed it!
[71:59.62]No, no, I didn't!
[72:01.58]Excuse me.
[72:02.52]They can't hear me.
[72:03.06]I'm a fucking ghost.
[72:04.22]I did all the work.
[72:05.26]I did all the work.
[72:06.14]That was me that did that.
[72:08.27]You got him.
[72:08.77]You got him.
[72:09.37]One hit in the head.
[72:13.45]Hey, Vinny, I unscrewed the pickle jar and then somebody did the last turn, you know what I mean?
[72:19.96]We don't want him to get... We need $200!
[72:21.38]Okay, you're late.
[72:24.64]Light him.
[72:25.22]Light him up!
[72:28.97]That's a bad thing.
[72:29.51]What the hell is that?
[72:30.55]Get him!
[72:37.01]Good.
[72:37.37]Good.
[72:37.95]Good.
[72:38.45]He's down.
[72:38.93]He's down.
[72:39.27]He's down.
[72:39.69]Alright, let's loot.
[72:41.03]I don't know if this is the goofiest shit ever.
[72:45.07]Key.
[72:45.58]Key.
[72:45.76]It's so goofy.
[72:48.76]Trying to conserve flashlight.
[72:50.76]It's like a mothman.
[72:52.42]Oh, we got fire exit over here as well.
[72:57.80]I'm almost dead.
[72:59.92]What happened to him?
[73:03.52]He fell and he was like, I'm almost dead.
[73:05.62]But he fell in such a comical way.
[73:08.62]Oh, I was on Ster.
[73:13.34]This is just like comedy after comedy.
[73:15.52]At least we got a sign.
[73:16.64]I got a bolt.
[73:18.26]Yeah, that's not bad.
[73:19.40]I got a bolt.
[73:20.49]I got a bolt.
[73:21.33]I barely see anything.
[73:24.45]We just need about like 10 more of those.
[73:29.21]Hey dude, you're gonna play WWE 2K23.
[73:31.29]I'm feeling a little heavy.
[73:32.91]Um, I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[73:34.81]I hope this area is clear.
[73:35.75]Trevor, did you ever play SCORN?
[73:44.39]I did.
[73:44.83]What the fuck was that?
[73:46.15]Yeah.
[73:46.65]Where is it?
[73:47.11]Oh god, oh god, oh god.
[73:52.97]You gotta keep hitting that fucking thing.
[73:54.21]I got it, I got it.
[73:55.63]Oh my god.
[73:56.49]Oh my god.
[73:56.89]You thought 3K.
[73:58.15]Oh my god.
[73:59.75]I'm just imagining this in real life.
[74:01.39]Like, this is what they're saying in real life.
[74:03.49]There's no way the company fires this after this.
[74:07.29]Hey, I enchanted it with my soul.
[74:09.15]Plus five damage.
[74:10.55]Oh!
[74:11.69]You missed a key.
[74:13.37]You're fired.
[74:13.99]Yeah, SCORN was ridiculous.
[74:15.70]I'm gonna... What happened?
[74:23.02]Is he gone?
[74:24.74]Hey, I dropped the bolts out there.
[74:26.52]Oh, can you go out there for a second?
[74:28.89]I come right back.
[74:29.81]Just testing something.
[74:35.49]But we heard that.
[74:36.91]What?
[74:37.97]It's 4.30.
[74:38.57]Did he not?
[74:39.53]He didn't want to hear.
[74:40.89]Nah, true though.
[74:41.69]True.
[74:42.07]Yeah, I feel you.
[74:42.77]True.
[74:43.13]Absolutely true.
[74:45.23]Even in a situation like this, I ain't farting in front of anybody.
[74:49.09]Yeah.
[74:50.03]Life or death, I'm holding that shit in.
[74:52.77]I went to see Oppenheimer.
[74:54.07]I think we're doomed.
[74:54.65]And I held a fart for like three hours.
[74:56.32]Yeah.
[74:58.70]Because I didn't need another bomb to go off in the theater and that's not a joke, that's real.
[75:03.92]There's another one!
[75:04.58]Another spider?
[75:05.48]Dude, it's... I... You're one of those non-public farters, huh?
[75:09.86]What's that noise?
[75:10.34]Do you hear this?
[75:11.52]I mean... I do, I don't see it.
[75:12.80]Yeah, for the most part, yes.
[75:14.18]I don't know, let's get out of here.
[75:16.94]We're dead if we don't find the spider.
[75:18.54]I feel like this is a crazy lobby because this is three non-public farters.
[75:23.12]Jesus Christ!
[75:23.58]What is it?
[75:25.04]I don't know!
[75:26.00]What is it?
[75:28.14]Ahhh!
[75:29.12]What is it?
[75:30.91]Oh, fuck, man.
[75:33.83]I'm thinking I need a new job.
[75:35.61]What was it?
[75:36.05]What was it?
[75:36.99]I don't know.
[75:37.65]I've never seen it.
[75:38.39]There's one of those fuckers on the ceiling right here, though.
[75:41.59]Tick or something.
[75:46.23]Wow, what a fucking Chad.
[75:48.27]Holy shit, he's killing everything.
[75:51.41]Oh, man.
[75:51.77]I don't know.
[75:52.09]It had like this big circular toothy face.
[75:54.95]I think it's straight this way.
[76:02.18]Wait, did we come from here?
[76:04.52]Yeah, I feel like we've been everywhere.
[76:06.46]I always feel that, though.
[76:09.96]Oh, what is this?
[76:12.44]What is this, huh?
[76:13.78]It's new.
[76:14.64]New?
[76:15.80]Oh, there's items in here.
[76:16.98]Oh, there's the good stuff.
[76:17.99]What did you do?
[76:18.59]Oh, look at that.
[76:20.13]Okay, okay.
[76:21.83]Wow, they did it.
[76:22.93]Let me get this Ed Beater.
[76:24.07]Maybe there's hope.
[76:25.73]Okay, I think there is hope.
[76:29.74]They don't have much time though, I think they've got probably another couple minutes.
[76:32.72]Are you gonna carry the big thing?
[76:33.82]Oh my god, I'm so jumpy now.
[76:36.02]That's you!
[76:37.74]It's me, it's me, hey.
[76:41.50]We could save the company.
[76:45.36]Something's in the fence.
[76:48.79]What is that?
[76:49.63]What, what, what, what?
[76:50.89]I don't, what is it?
[76:51.61]Oh, there's two?
[76:53.13]There's a steering wheel here.
[76:54.03]There's a blob, there's a blob monster coming!
[76:57.29]Oh, blob.
[76:57.91]Okay, we gotta find the fire exit.
[77:02.46]Oh, this shit's gonna be worth millions of dollars.
[77:05.52]Oh, yeah.
[77:05.88]This will save the whole company.
[77:06.86]Maybe we just go straight.
[77:09.30]And left.
[77:11.93]Oh, God.
[77:12.39]And then left.
[77:13.71]Oh, God.
[77:14.83]And then... Oh, crap.
[77:15.69]That's not the way.
[77:16.69]That's not the way.
[77:18.63]They're boxing themselves in over here.
[77:21.45]I should have dropped the key for one of the other items.
[77:25.73]Oh, I don't like this noise, man.
[77:27.59]Blob is following them.
[77:30.55]Oh, no.
[77:30.71]It's gonna be this way.
[77:32.52]No.
[77:33.62]I think it's definitely down this way where the murder pile is left.
[77:37.35]Yeah.
[77:39.43]Oh, here!
[77:40.49]Nice.
[77:41.21]We're home!

[77:43.49]They're almost home free.
[77:45.09]Alright, let's make it back.
[77:45.97]We might be able to save this.
[77:46.89]How much time do they have?

[77:52.67]I'm gonna grab a key.

[80:39.10]You saved our careers.
[80:41.64]That last minute decision saved everything, sir.

[80:52.24]Wow, I can get half of like a donut.
[80:55.10]You bet, you bet, you bet.
[80:56.94]Oh, tickets to the company.
[81:00.53]Let's go.
[81:01.21]What are you lackeys doing?
[81:02.52]I've done enough work.
[81:04.10]Alright.
[81:05.04]Digesting in a spider.
[81:06.60]Okay.
[81:08.20]How many poke?
[81:09.94]Most kills?
[81:11.30]Oh, man.
[81:11.70]I killed so many things.
[81:13.10]You got like four kills.
[81:14.98]I ran back to Jerma's body to get the shovel.
[81:17.26]What do I type in?
[81:20.98]You go to moons and then it's the top one, the base.
[81:25.40]The company building?
[81:26.85]Whatever it is.
[81:27.47]You guys missed it during the chaos but a fucking sandworm from Dune almost ate him as he jumped onto the ship.
[81:33.43]I saw that.
[81:35.33]You didn't see that?
[81:37.87]No, I didn't see it.
[81:39.37]It was crazy.
[81:40.61]As you jumped on the ladder, you should have died.
[81:42.75]That's what I'm saying.
[81:44.59]You should have died.
[81:45.13]Let me check the clip.
[81:47.18]That was truly unbelievable.
[81:50.68]this needs to be like an edit because that was like a movie oh my god there was there was a sandworm from doom you should have died yeah you should have died you got a second lease at life oh that was a movie alright let's go
[82:16.53]Put it in the trailer Devon chat.
[82:18.45]That's one of my chat members.
[82:19.85]Yeah, seriously.
[82:20.37]Very cool.
[82:26.40]Alright, I'm just like I just want to live.
[82:29.56]Maybe we can like do a mission where I live.
[82:31.62]That would be cool.
[82:32.42]This is us just selling, right?
[82:33.90]You got it.
[82:34.66]Yeah, just so I'm gonna look at this list.
[82:40.07]Will take care of it.
[82:41.13]Do you take a load off for a little while?
[82:43.83]Yeah, don't start.
[82:44.75]You can just relax.
[82:46.03]You're going to have to do that exact same thing in like 10 minutes.
[82:51.35]Running away from sandworms.
[82:53.37]Should we keep the sign?
[82:54.31]Yeah, I like the sign.
[82:56.73]Wait, we might need every dollar.
[82:58.43]Oh, okay.
[82:59.19]Shit.
[83:00.19]Do we lose money because of bodies?
[83:01.49]Let me see.
[83:10.55]I've never seen that before.
[83:11.93]What the fuck?
[83:15.26]That is a whole ass dune worm.
[83:18.64]I mean that- You saw it?
[83:19.92]Yeah.
[83:23.20]Yeah.
[83:23.58]Are we missing items?
[83:24.78]It's like we were making a machinima.
[83:26.52]That's like how like crazy that was.
[83:28.96]Yeah, that was like movie quality.
[83:31.55]Like that would be unrealistic in a Marvel film.
[83:41.09]Cool.
[83:41.53]There's a hatch behind the containers.
[83:43.25]I saw that, but what do you do with it?
[83:44.37]Anything?
[83:46.50]um and you still got the flashlight and it's fully charged professionals I think we're short I shouldn't be there might have been a death penalty for us oh we might have got death penalty no it said we do you guys have any items to sell no no I got a flashlight
[84:18.19]I don't know if they're worth anything.
[84:20.93]And then we could put some bodies in.
[84:23.01]Death penalties are only for the bank, not the quota, apparently.
[84:25.79]Wait, wait, wait.
[84:26.09]If we die, do we get a penalty after we tell the bodies?
[84:31.66]I don't think so.
[84:32.54]If you eat me right now, just... The manual is worth $5, apparently.
[84:38.18]What about these crayons?
[84:43.30]I don't know.
[84:44.40]It's a penalty to your money, not your quota.
[84:47.07]Yeah, I think we're fine.
[84:51.13]Where's the quota?
[84:51.81]How can we find it?
[84:53.45]That didn't even count for anything.
[84:54.57]0.
[84:56.07]Yeah, we're short guys.
[84:59.22]We're short by like $5.
[85:03.84]How much is the manual?
[85:06.34]It should have been 230.
[85:06.82]We had like 250 bucks actually.
[85:10.22]Yeah, we checked.
[85:17.78]Is that worth anything?
[85:21.92]Apparently the bolts are missing.
[85:25.50]Check under the red shelf.
[85:27.48]Is there anything under there?
[85:31.30]No.
[85:33.61]Where did the bolts go?
[85:34.49]Are they already sold?
[85:42.47]Sell the shelf.
[85:44.21]He didn't drop bolts from inventory.
[85:47.26]It says Ster was left behind.
[85:49.68]I counted as left behind.
[85:52.88]That's what happened.
[85:54.54]Oh, so you died or something.
[85:57.06]But I was on the ship.
[85:58.71]I think the cut scene was... Oh, that's too bad.
[86:01.33]Okay.
[86:02.55]Well, I get it.
[86:05.21]Well, that's unfortunate.
[86:06.09]We're failures.
[86:08.25]Well, let's just do it again.
[86:09.01]That's easy.
[86:10.47]Yeah, we all know how to play now.
[86:12.53]Yes.
[86:12.87]Now I'm very aware of how the game is played.
[86:17.51]Ster, have you gone to the other planets or no?
[86:19.61]Uh, I've never made it past like the first three.
[86:26.11]Yeah.

[90:29.83]Not, no, it'll be further.
[90:31.01]Okay.
[90:33.29]I mean, this is probably already quota.
[90:36.95]If we can actually get it back.

[93:40.19]Yeah, we noticed.
[93:47.71]Always the most paranoid.
[93:49.77]Injuries, too.
[93:50.39]Alright.
[93:55.11]I don't want to choose the planet.
[93:56.53]I got it.
[93:57.85]I like typing in this.
[93:58.87]It makes me feel like, you know, I'm... What was that guy's name in Goldeneye?
[94:03.69]Boris.
[94:04.71]Boris.
[94:05.67]I am invincible.

[94:12.42]Yeah, what was that noise?
[94:14.20]Did you guys hear that?
[94:16.56]I do hear it.
[94:17.12]It's the guzzler.
[94:18.68]Wait, did you guys hear a hey?
[94:19.98]Or am I tripping?
[94:20.56]It's the guzzler.
[94:22.08]Hey.
[94:27.69]What's that?
[94:28.29]What's that?
[94:29.97]Oh.
[94:31.86]Alright.
[94:32.16]Alright, everybody.
[94:33.30]You know the drill.
[94:34.06]Did someone put the... Did someone put it through their mic?
[94:38.13]Nope.
[94:38.55]The hay?
[94:38.91]No.
[94:41.39]Somebody's like... No.
[94:43.97]Anybody do it for real?
[94:45.13]Own up to... What?
[94:47.83]What was that?
[94:48.59]Oh, no.
[94:51.28]Gordon Freeman.
[94:52.28]I thought I'd never see the day.
[94:54.52]What the fuck was that?
[94:55.42]Alright.
[94:57.44]We might have landed on someone.
[95:02.84]Gorgonzola.
[95:04.10]We're going, uh... We're going this way.
[95:06.16]Right behind you.
[95:14.93]Isn't Gorgonzola cheese?
[95:17.17]That's right.
[95:17.85]Very good.
[95:18.43]It's a giant-ass pumpkin.
[95:27.69]What the fuck was that?
[95:32.81]Was that you or the game?
[95:34.93]That was me.
[95:35.23]Half-Life, but Gordon Ramsay instead of Gordon Ramsay.
[95:36.89]I think that was his Yoda impression.
[95:41.17]Oh, there's the domino.
[95:45.71]Let's go.
[95:49.39]Alright.
[95:51.17]Whoa, whoa.
[95:52.39]What the fuck is going on?
[95:53.77]Somebody banging on the door?
[95:56.49]Oh.
[95:56.77]There's a turret on the other side.
[95:59.54]What are we supposed to do?
[96:00.10]We just turn the power off?
[96:02.83]I'm not going to open it.
[96:03.77]I just wanted to see where it was.
[96:05.96]Don't open this.
[96:07.32]Who opened it?
[96:08.00]Who opened it?
[96:08.78]That's crazy.
[96:10.30]It was Vinny.
[96:12.40]Yeah, it was me.
[96:13.08]Sorry.
[96:13.80]Okay, let's keep moving.
[96:14.98]Stop doing it.
[96:16.22]Stop.
[96:16.62]Perfect comedy timing, Ster.
[96:22.20]No problem.
[96:23.85]Ster, I'll go down with you.
[96:24.59]Alright, grab this.
[96:27.47]You got the muscles.
[96:28.45]Probably could have grabbed it.
[96:29.75]I'm bringing this up.
[96:34.16]Oh, we ain't got a flashlight.
[96:35.42]I need you to go first.
[96:36.40]Wait, I'll go first.
[96:37.26]I got a stop sign.
[96:38.04]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[96:38.78]Let me put this down first.
[96:40.08]Alright, where... Ster, where are you?
[96:45.84]Okay, this is empty.
[96:46.88]This is empty.
[96:49.78]Shut this door.
[96:51.81]Nothing in there at all?
[96:53.67]Nope.
[96:54.21]Dead end.
[96:54.45]I can't find you anymore.
[96:55.23]Wait, where was I?
[97:01.43]Oh, okay.
[97:01.65]This is...
[97:03.89]I think they went down this way.
[97:05.01]It's quiet down here.
[97:08.62]Yeah, we don't we don't got any flashlights.
[97:15.54]What the hell was that?
[97:20.74]Oh, there they are.
[97:22.96]Hey guys.
[97:25.74]Stop!
[97:26.98]Hey, we need a key.
[97:28.38]Stop, collaborate and listen.
[97:34.82]We don't have any light.
[97:35.60]Can you flash your, like... your scan?
[97:42.44]You can see it a little bit.
[97:44.39]Yeah, it's still pretty dark.
[97:47.45]I mean, I'm not disagreeing.
[97:50.23]Pope, can you let us know if it's worth going over there?
[97:52.59]Yeah, I think it is.
[97:53.55]We have to jump?
[97:56.01]Oh, we have to jump.
[97:56.91]Okay.
[97:57.73]I don't want to do this.
[98:00.09]Be careful of your weight.
[98:01.85]It's not worth it.
[98:03.27]Fuck.
[98:03.73]Just a locked door.
[98:05.73]But this is a big area out there.
[98:08.18]We need to go in there.
[98:09.88]There's nothing even here.
[98:10.78]Wait, yes, we're good.
[98:13.26]Yeah, jump over.
[98:13.86]We'll jump over.
[98:15.48]Do you have the key?
[98:17.66]Just jump over.
[98:18.94]I really don't want to.
[98:20.50]We found a warehouse, like an Indiana Jones-style warehouse.
[98:24.40]Alright, sir, if I can do it, you can.
[98:26.18]You know that.
[98:30.19]Excellent.
[98:30.51]That was way too slow.
[98:32.77]That was so slow.
[98:33.37]I got the sign!
[98:37.21]Locked.
[98:41.60]Come on!
[98:41.80]Uh, I know I'm coming, I'm coming.
[98:43.78]Guys, I... You're gonna get left behind.
[98:45.40]I heard a weird squeak.
[98:47.90]I keep hearing this, like, scientist scream.
[98:50.04]Oh!
[98:50.28]Oh!
[98:50.34]Oh!
[98:50.70]What's wrong?
[98:52.20]I heard I saw something.
[98:53.84]Something.
[98:54.56]Something.
[98:54.76]Something's got glowing eyes and it's coming this way!
[98:57.08]What?
[98:57.38]Why?
[98:59.86]Is anyone here brave?
[99:01.54]Okay, listen.
[99:02.49]Here, I'll go first.
[99:03.29]Someone take the sign.
[99:04.17]Yeah, but we have a stop sign.
[99:05.45]You use the sign because that's how you fight.
[99:07.17]You have to smash it.
[99:08.05]There's some things you can't fight.
[99:11.39]Are we running by this?
[99:14.17]Someone in my chat said don't look in the eye.
[99:17.65]Oh, somebody, something happened.
[99:20.91]There's people getting killed in here.
[99:22.33]Oh, this is locked.
[99:24.61]I think it is.
[99:28.04]Oh my god!
[99:28.46]Oh my god!
[99:28.79]It's an Enderman!
[99:29.57]It's an Enderman!
[99:30.31]It's an Enderman!
[99:30.75]Don't look at it!
[99:31.59]Don't look at it!
[99:33.15]Oh my god!
[99:34.15]It's an Enderman!
[99:35.63]Don't look at him!
[99:44.12]Oh!
[99:45.70]What is your phone doing?
[99:46.98]What is your phone doing?
[99:47.94]It's freaking me out!
[99:48.92]What happened?
[99:49.98]Wait, what?
[99:50.30]What happened?
[99:50.90]What did I fall through?
[99:57.95]uh brush as well there's a brush here holy what happened to me I walked off the ledge we need to leave because it is late it's probably not that late your cat
[100:23.49]There was a gap.
[100:25.37]Chat, I think you're gonna get the most paranoid.
[100:28.45]It's so dark.
[100:28.81]We have a stop sign.
[100:29.75]We have a stop sign.
[100:31.55]I'll kill it.
[100:33.17]We gotta make this jump.
[100:39.32]Yeah, I'm gonna talk about how I fought the monster.
[100:42.08]And I found a... I found like a sign or a shovel in the ground.
[100:47.10]And it was so insane.
[100:48.40]I was like jumping around and I hit it five times.
[100:50.66]And then I ran into another room.
[100:54.74]Oh boy.
[100:57.00]It is still... It's going to kill him.
[101:02.66]Oh, he's gone.
[101:03.30]No, he's alive.
[101:05.48]Oh, Ster it.
[101:23.61]I can't believe they all made it.
[101:28.31]I can't believe I fell.
[101:30.11]I'm so pissed.
[101:37.53]Why do I have to die by falling?
[101:42.78]The bottles are heavier.
[101:44.96]Is it really?
[101:45.42]Yeah, it's fine.
[101:46.04]Don't worry about it.
[101:46.52]Let's go.
[101:46.92]Does that make any sense?
[101:48.14]I don't know.
[101:48.52]It doesn't make any sense.
[101:49.34]There's just a couple bottles.
[101:50.36]Oh.
[101:58.27]I think our ship is past the pumpkin.
[102:04.04]You got punished by the lightning God.
[102:09.66]I was just so scared.
[102:10.84]Oh, they're not real.
[102:20.74]Nice.
[102:25.43]Okay, I have to.
[102:27.35]What is it?
[102:28.15]Show me that phone right now.
[102:30.03]What the heck is that thing?
[102:32.49]It just keeps screaming.
[102:36.59]No, this is like a curse.
[102:38.03]This summons something.
[102:41.00]Yeah, so Jerm is definitely dead, right?
[102:43.52]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[102:44.94]100%.
[102:46.08]You see, he isn't moving.
[102:47.88]Eventually we can buy a teleporter and bring his body back.
[102:51.88]Okay.
[102:58.00]You have to make up a monster attack.
[102:59.74]It's the only way they'll respect you.
[103:08.45]Guys, I should not be alive right now.
[103:11.55]That weird creature, the homunculus, got me several times.
[103:16.29]Oh, did you scan it?
[103:18.37]I don't think I scanned it, but I got fucked up by it pretty badly.
[103:23.64]That was rough.
[103:25.02]That was really rough.
[103:25.78]Yeah, nobody scanned it.
[103:27.08]How'd you die?
[103:28.46]So that Enderman thing was looking at me, and I turned and looked the other way to get away from it, and another monster was in the hallway, so I had to run by that monster, and at that point I was just surrounded.
[103:39.15]So I banged right as fast as I could, and I just found a shovel on the ground.
[103:44.65]I was swinging, swinging, swinging.
[103:45.97]I killed one thing, one of those little bugs, but the Enderman thing killed me eventually.
[103:50.94]I don't know, did you guys hear me screaming?
[103:51.88]I was screaming what was happening.
[103:54.06]I was getting killed by that other creature, so I didn't really hear you.
[103:59.31]he's lying by the way don't trust him oh he tripped fell and broke his hip they're not even watching my stream um going to uh doing a little bit of a victory lap we got three three three already going to the country gonna eat a lot of peaches
[104:25.61]Yeah, there was a gap in the floor that we were running around.
[104:28.13]What did you say?
[104:31.54]I don't know.
[104:32.76]Can I do the store right now?
[104:36.26]I think so.
[104:36.64]Flashlights?
[104:39.42]Yeah, I think you should get some flashlights and also maybe... I don't know.
[104:43.76]Oh, no, because we haven't spent money.
[104:45.92]We haven't actually turned in yet.
[104:47.20]That's the issue.
[104:49.20]Oh.
[104:51.64]But we can get lit too.
[105:01.68]Yeah, we got flashlights coming.
[105:03.58]Two flashlights.
[105:04.58]Two flashlights?
[105:06.37]Um, what the fuck is that thing?
[105:09.35]That thing was running on the ground.
[105:10.45]That was like a roadrunner.
[105:11.25]What?
[105:11.47]Oh.
[105:11.55]What the fuck is that?
[105:13.57]Yeah, it's like sprinting.
[105:17.47]What's what?
[105:18.72]These things.
[105:19.64]What?
[105:20.64]What is going on?
[105:21.34]I don't see any of them.
[105:22.92]What are they called?
[105:25.56]Watch out!
[105:27.94]Alright, let's go.
[105:30.71]You can get that.
[105:37.03]You can get it.
[105:40.71]It's almost midnight.
[105:41.51]Your chat's, like, scared it's getting late already.
[105:44.13]It's 9.30.
[105:46.89]Vinny, abandon mission.
[105:48.11]Quick, get back to the ship.
[105:49.21]And I'm gonna play as the Pirate Speed.
[105:53.01]Well, you're allowed to play however you'd like.
[105:57.09]It was a funny video.
[105:57.73]Gordon Ramsay, so good to see you.
[105:59.83]Alright, let's go.
[106:03.23]You ready?
[106:05.10]Get in there.
[106:09.42]Whoa.
[106:10.54]Smacked ass.
[106:13.52]Alright, what do we got?
[106:15.28]Key on the ground.
[106:17.74]A good find.
[106:18.55]What's in there?
[106:19.05]I don't know.
[106:20.31]Not sure.
[106:24.81]What's wrong?
[106:38.65]Hi, there was something behind me, I think.
[106:48.83]There was something behind me and I closed the door.
[106:52.66]I heard a weird noise.
[106:54.34]It was like a finger cracking noise.
[106:57.10]There's something straight ahead here.
[107:00.14]Are you sure?
[107:00.78]Yeah, I'm positive.
[107:02.80]What the hell was that?
[107:05.00]What just happened?
[107:08.39]There's something in here.
[107:09.39]Oh, fire exit right here.
[107:14.50]It's us.
[107:15.24]We're in here.
[107:15.80]It's four of us.
[107:16.76]In this door right here, there's a monster behind here, by the way.
[107:19.30]Like, I don't know what it is, but it was... There is.
[107:21.60]I assure you.
[107:22.80]What kind of monster?
[107:23.70]I don't know.
[107:24.18]I made a loud noise and I ran away.
[107:26.18]Can you describe it?
[107:26.88]Describe the noise?
[107:28.70]Can you recreate it?
[107:30.02]I think I can.
[107:31.68]Go, go!
[107:39.78]Yo.
[107:41.28]Yo.
[107:42.98]What's the dealio, as they say?
[107:44.58]Can we open this?
[107:46.80]Can we go back and open this door?
[107:47.76]Yeah, I was gonna ask, how does that work?
[107:50.84]I'll go back.
[107:51.32]Okay, let's wait here, guys.
[107:53.10]C7.
[107:54.32]C7?
[107:54.64]Okay, good.
[107:55.04]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[107:57.20]Try and get, like, another door number if you can, too.
[108:00.12]I can see on the camera, don't worry.
[108:01.94]There is something.
[108:02.66]It's one of these little shits.
[108:04.30]Do we have anything to kill it with?
[108:06.73]Don't waste your flashlight.
[108:08.41]Does anyone have a stop sign?
[108:09.82]It's here.
[108:10.52]It's like right here.
[108:11.36]It's right behind.
[108:13.96]You don't need to worry about it.
[108:14.92]Okay.
[108:16.28]I trust you.
[108:17.00]We're waiting for a punk to open this door from the ship.
[108:23.09]Just chill.
[108:24.33]Calm your nerves.
[108:27.15]I'll stab it with the key if it comes close.
[108:29.49]It's right there.
[108:30.05]Dude, it's right here.
[108:32.01]Yeah.
[108:32.39]Calm down.
[108:32.77]Calm down.
[108:35.49]Oh.
[108:35.61]Where'd Vinny go?
[108:36.89]Oh.
[108:37.79]Hey.
[108:38.07]Hey.
[108:39.97]I don't know.
[108:42.05]Get in.
[108:43.75]I thought you told me to com- Whoa!
[108:48.59]Oh, goddammit, man.
[108:49.67]So when you said Vinny, you literally walked around that door.
[108:52.27]Oh, yeah.
[108:55.05]Yeah, this is just a- Well, that's still helpful.
[109:02.21]I don't know.
[109:02.58]I'm not finding anything in here.
[109:04.54]I have a key, but I don't know.
[109:06.08]There's nothing on the ground or anything.
[109:08.16]Just gotta find a door.
[109:10.20]Let's see.
[109:12.93]Yeah, keys you can use between planets as well.
[109:16.87]Alright, you ready?
[109:17.37]Yep.
[109:17.49]Okay, I'm ready.
[109:19.85]Come on, come on, come on.
[109:21.25]And it looks like... Nothing.
[109:30.83]Oh, nice.
[109:31.55]I've never seen a key used that was helpful.
[109:34.99]Personally.
[109:35.84]Where's Poke?
[109:37.68]He went back to the ship to open the door.
[109:39.60]Oh, that's right.
[109:40.30]Has anyone made this jump?
[109:43.04]I thought Poke did, but that was the fire exit.
[109:45.34]I don't know if it's the same thing.
[109:46.70]I think this is a different one.
[109:47.80]I guess this is a different one.
[109:49.23]I'm gonna... Okay, you next.
[109:58.79]Is it worth it?
[110:01.08]Uh, no.
[110:02.86]Shit.
[110:04.42]There's nothing in here.
[110:07.83]We don't need none of this.
[110:10.35]But there's a key.
[110:12.01]Oh, was there?
[110:12.43]Am I blind?
[110:13.03]Yeah.
[110:25.28]There was another door that required a key not far back.
[110:27.74]I think we could use it.
[110:28.74]Something's probably saying we should look at the monitor to see where loot is before we come in.
[110:32.69]Oh, oh, oh.
[110:34.45]Oh, bingo.
[110:35.75]Oh, in here, in here, guys.
[110:36.69]Guys, guys, come back.
[110:38.15]In here, too.
[110:38.79]We got shit in here.
[110:39.63]Oh, we got a ton of stuff.
[110:41.63]Really?
[110:47.38]What else is in here?
[110:49.29]Oh, there was a big, uh, spindle.
[110:52.21]Let me get it.
[110:52.66]A spindle?
[110:55.32]A big spindle.
[110:58.28]Oh, there's a metal scrap on the floor in this strange David Lynchian room.
[111:04.40]I can't pick that up.
[111:05.45]Hold on.
[111:08.69]Okay.
[111:09.25]Okay, we gotta find the exit.
[111:10.39]We're good.
[111:11.77]We're all very heavy.
[111:12.63]Tell me about it.
[111:17.05]I prefer the term chunky.
[111:21.72]This is probably some big money, right?
[111:30.49]I don't know where I'm going.
[111:31.61]Just to let you all know.
[111:32.45]Yeah, just keep going.
[111:33.33]Here's a... You get it?
[111:37.83]Yeah.
[111:38.21]Oh, we got bottles.
[111:39.13]Bottles too.
[111:40.25]Hold on.
[111:41.11]Unless we get poked back, I don't think we're going to be using those bottles.
[111:45.49]Hey, what's worth more?
[111:46.19]The bottles or the engine?
[111:49.49]uh if you drop it and scan it you can see 48 bottles are worth more than engine my chat today okay I'll just take the bottles there's there's a engine up there if uh any folk can get it I think folks probably chilling at the base he might even be dead possible we're in pretty deep I don't know how to get back
[112:16.70]I think we gotta make that jump again, right?
[112:18.76]But we're counting.
[112:19.58]Maybe, maybe.
[112:20.68]Well, we don't have a locked door here, but I can solve that problem.
[112:23.68]Okay, that might help.
[112:25.00]Oh, this one's locked too.
[112:30.93]What the hell?
[112:32.31]A lot of locked doors here.
[112:35.71]Who would do that?
[112:37.11]There's another key.
[112:39.05]Is there?
[112:40.17]Yeah, got it.
[112:43.13]This is going pretty well so far.
[112:46.52]There's going to be a bunker spider in here.
[112:49.38]Is there a bunker spider?
[112:51.02]Not in here.
[112:51.60]Oh, generator.
[112:53.02]There's an apparatus thing.
[112:54.66]Those are worth a lot, right?
[112:56.14]Yeah, let me grab that and then we'll path back to the locked door.
[113:02.87]How much is it?
[113:04.25]Okay, I still... Warning, there's radiation.
[113:08.79]Oh boy.
[113:09.55]Don't go that way.
[113:12.16]Stop breathing that thing in!
[113:13.28]I have a key for that locked door, so... I just don't remember where it was.
[113:20.07]Same.
[113:21.75]This door.
[113:37.89]I can leave with the light.
[113:40.07]Yeah, you should be.
[113:40.61]Yeah, please do.
[113:41.19]Please do.
[113:41.45]We get a little bit of vision.
[113:46.19]If I die, you guys gotta get this.
[113:48.09]I'm seeing like hundreds of MonkaS's right now.
[113:50.59]Chill, chill, chill.
[113:51.13]It's fine.
[113:51.66]It's fine.

[114:06.91]Okay, I'm stupid.
[114:08.83]Get out of here.
[114:13.77]Okay, yeah, then it must be this way through the door.

[114:25.06]Oh, oh.
[114:26.82]Nice.
[114:27.10]Got it.

[114:36.39]This is the biggest hall yet.
[114:40.67]Be careful.

[118:52.64]Is it Eclipse?
[118:53.32]Okay.
[118:53.58]No, all three of them were unsafe.
[118:54.86]Should we start with flashlights or Bukovskis or whatever?
[118:57.14]Um, how much money do you start with?
[118:59.12]Oh, we can.
[118:59.38]Do you start with money?
[119:00.16]Yeah, like 50 bucks, I think.
[119:01.16]Oh, okay.
[119:19.93]There are two flashlights and, uh... What is this emote?
[119:26.44]Wait, we were told not to trust the trees.
[119:30.09]Uh, only at night.
[119:32.75]Alright, we got an order coming in.
[119:48.41]Great asset.

[120:03.47]There's one flashlight.
[120:04.31]Who wants the shovel?
[120:05.63]I'll take the flashlight.
[120:07.87]I don't want to be responsible.
[120:08.89]Also, remember that's here.
[120:12.46]We'll get it on the way out.
[120:14.26]Oh.
[120:14.58]They're worth money.
[120:16.02]Beehive.
[120:16.34]Alright, we're good to go.

[120:17.52]It's this way over here.
[120:19.28]Alright there.
[120:24.95]Go for it.
[120:31.07]Fellers, where have you gone?
[120:32.97]Over here.
[120:35.45]Just across.
[120:38.76]Isn't it scary to be on this bridge?
[120:43.26]Maybe we should not be on the bridge all the same.
[120:45.12]Oh my Jesus Christ, dude.
[120:47.32]You guys OK?
[120:55.40]Yeah, yeah, just the sprained ankle.
[120:58.90]There's a giant pumpkin.
[121:15.21]That's kind of cool.
[121:17.04]How much health do you have?
[121:19.78]Red.
[121:21.20]Okay.
[121:22.36]Hey, hey, Poke.
[121:23.20]How much health do you have?
[121:25.36]I'm great.
[121:25.92]I feel healthy.
[121:29.03]Take this.
[121:33.09]Because I am a monster breathing on me away from dying.
[121:39.73]Yeah, same here.
[121:43.42]I will protect you guys.
[121:45.24]Thank you, Pope.
[121:46.22]Just look for loot.
[121:48.73]Down this way, there's some barrels.
[121:53.03]Oh, we're separated.
[121:54.57]We're going over here.
[121:57.23]We're over here.
[121:57.71]We've got some barrels.
[122:00.56]Oh, nice, nice, nice.
[122:03.54]I don't know what that sound is.
[122:07.38]What is that sound?
[122:09.58]Pioneer killings.
[122:13.15]Oh, a dead end.
[122:13.77]Nice.
[122:14.51]Oh, come on.

[122:31.09]Can you carry these bottles?
[122:33.27]I have a light.
[122:33.69]Do you have a flashlight?
[122:34.19]Do you want to take the flashlight?
[122:36.29]You can use both.
[122:37.73]Oh, you can.

[123:17.13]Help us get out of here.
[123:18.43]Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

[123:32.63]You clocked him.
[123:33.83]You clotheslined him.
[123:35.91]I'm so sorry.
[123:37.29]No!
[123:41.02]Should I pick him up?
[123:42.26]Oh, we have so many items.
[123:44.98]I'll pick him up.
[123:45.97]Someone take the shovel.
[123:47.35]It was pretty far back this way was the main entrance.
[123:51.61]Is the fire exit close?
[123:53.69]77.
[123:53.71]77.
[123:56.39]The body dies.
[123:57.95]I mean, this is worth more than the bottles.
[123:59.37]I'll pick this.
[123:59.75]I'll take this.
[124:00.65]You came from this way, sir, right?
[124:01.93]So it should be this way, no?
[124:04.31]I came from... Yeah...
[124:10.78]I think it's here.
[124:12.80]Where you guys go?
[124:14.84]Come, come, come, come.
[124:15.62]Oh, I see.
[124:16.00]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[124:21.00]If you hear me, Vinny, I'm sorry, man.
[124:22.46]Dude, you threw him off the ropes.
[124:24.12]He came back and you clotheslined him.
[124:26.42]There's a bridge down this way.
[124:32.01]Let's do that.
[124:33.41]The body.
[124:34.75]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[124:35.93]One at a time.
[124:37.51]wait no this is the good bridge he gave me the shovel too the dam well hey I'm gonna make a can I make an executive call here what is it yeah there's a uh there's a beehive near the ship we said we'd grab the beehive and leave why don't we deposit this stuff first
[126:02.06]Jesus Christ!
[126:07.55]What is that thing?
[126:08.93]Where's my shovel?
[126:10.49]Don't leave.
[126:11.25]What happened?
[126:12.35]Why did you scream?
[126:13.71]You screamed and he killed me.
[126:18.01]Wait, I... Wait a minute.
[126:19.79]Who screamed, sir?
[126:22.95]Yeah, he might have doomed you, but that's alright.
[126:28.51]Oh my god.
[126:29.97]I need to, um...
[126:32.30]pass you up the heavy stuff.
[126:34.38]Mister, the door opens.
[126:40.42]Oh, that's so sad.
[126:42.17]Did you see what that looked like?
[126:44.33]That monster's mouth was awful.
[126:47.57]It was so bad.
[126:52.21]oh it was so scary apparently some of the okay so some of the outside enemies can hear and some of them can see that I was so quiet and I got to the very edge and poke just goes get in here and the guy grabbed me that one has vision oh might have vision yeah he's he's oh god I don't like that
[127:20.68]I think that's the loudest I've screamed.
[127:23.13]Jesus Christ.
[127:24.49]He can't get in now.
[127:27.39]I think he couldn't get in.
[127:32.69]He's up on the ship, though.
[127:34.81]He's not even outside.
[127:35.97]He climbed the ladder.
[127:37.67]Why are they still here?
[127:39.97]I had a propane tank.
[127:41.07]It was worth 77 bucks.
[127:44.53]No.
[127:44.71]These guys are scary, man.
[127:46.19]We just can't.
[127:48.63]Everyone was so quiet.
[127:49.97]This doesn't seem at all safe.
[127:52.15]But there's like a hundred dollars worth of stuff right there.
[127:56.57]They left most of the loot outside.
[127:58.75]Oh, that's so funny.
[128:00.27]He's just gonna grab me through the wall somehow and we're just gonna die.
[128:08.99]This is some serious greed.
[128:10.41]Yeah, this is dangerous.
[128:11.67]It's totally dangerous.
[128:15.82]Wario would approve.
[128:17.82]You know what these are called?
[128:22.11]I'll scan it right now.
[128:22.81]I was trying to get a scan.
[128:24.81]It wasn't working.
[128:28.01]That sounded real.
[128:29.13]Is that a scientist scream?
[128:32.79]No.
[128:33.65]The fart.
[128:34.69]Hey, come here.
[128:36.27]I think we got time.
[128:37.11]I'm going to pass this up.
[128:39.11]I'm telling you, he probably ate.
[128:41.31]He's coming back.
[128:43.71]Oh, he's running now.
[128:44.51]He's sprinting.
[128:45.51]Holy shit.
[128:46.35]It's so hard to get up the ladder with that fucking thing.
[129:02.58]He was close.
[129:03.80]God.
[129:04.24]He was close.
[129:06.80]Oh, Ster.
[129:08.53]Yeah, I know Poke ditched me.
[129:11.43]That was so, so sad.
[129:13.28]We were all so quiet too, and it just all fell apart at the end.
[129:17.32]He's an alcoholic.
[129:18.22]He needs a beer.
[129:20.46]I'm not sure that being quiet matters for them.
[129:22.20]I was trying to get the scan.
[129:25.50]That was so funny, Poke.
[129:27.08]I thought we all had to be quiet, and I get right to the banister, and I just hear you scream, Get in here!
[129:34.27]Just like, oh my god.
[129:36.59]No, but he was chasing you before I said that.
[129:39.45]That's so funny though.
[129:40.53]I thought I was being quiet and good.
[129:44.01]So some enemies can see far away and not, you know, it's not hearing based.
[129:50.01]That's so goddamn funny.
[129:53.06]Yeah, those ones can see.
[129:56.22]Yeah.
[129:58.56]Apparently some of the levels that we go on, like that one in particular, the enemies show up sooner.
[130:04.69]Yeah, that was 4 o'clock.
[130:05.73]What was going on there?
[130:06.53]There was a ton of them.
[130:11.61]Help!
[130:12.33]Help!
[130:13.37]Where's the... Where's the lights?
[130:15.89]I found it.
[130:19.05]Alright, let's see where to go.
[130:21.44]Get in here.
[130:22.60]Like, I must have looked so stupid.
[130:24.50]Like, hey, oh, I'm being so quiet and sneaking.
[130:26.62]It's like the guy can see you.
[130:27.92]He's coming after you right now.
[130:32.11]it's it's very hard when your hands are full it does not let you the map geometry is like lower than the floor I got a key in there out of light alright that's something at least somebody pumpkins here somebody brought a hairbrush back so that's good at least yes that's what I got alright um we found the pumpkin land geez what does this mean
[131:01.04]I think it means that Halloween's over.
[131:06.14]There are a lot of pumpkins here.
[131:08.00]It's true.
[131:13.96]This was the Halloween update.
[131:15.28]Oh, that explains it.
[131:16.46]Is it January?
[131:21.16]Yeah, it feels like it.
[131:26.96]Alright.
[131:28.58]Okay.
[131:35.80]There's loot right here in the beginning.
[131:38.32]Oh, we all split up.
[131:44.04]At least I did.
[131:45.28]I don't have any lights or anything.
[131:46.24]Hello?
[131:48.82]We have one flashlight among us.
[131:51.50]I have the flashlight.
[131:53.23]Oh, free generator!
[131:54.41]Here, take the gen.
[131:56.83]I got it.
[131:59.11]I'm back.
[132:05.01]There's a Pac-Man ghost chasing me.
[132:06.77]Something weird just happened.
[132:08.17]Someone come to the main entrance.
[132:10.14]No, I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go.
[132:12.52]Oh, someone.
[132:13.54]What's up?
[132:14.94]Let's do a run back because we already have a lot of stuff.
[132:17.52]Let's bring all this back.
[132:21.30]Really, really nice work fellas.
[132:22.48]Make sure we don't like bring it all back at night when there's like four trees and dogs around the base.
[132:29.29]Who has nothing?
[132:29.93]I have nothing.
[132:31.45]I'm almost dead.
[132:33.11]Who has nothing?
[132:34.03]There's no quicksand here or anything, right?
[132:41.13]No, it doesn't look like it.
[132:43.50]Here's my pro strat, Starwatch.
[132:46.60]It's run and jump, I think.
[132:48.66]Yeah.
[132:49.26]Okay.
[132:50.36]Yeah, that was pretty good.
[132:52.92]So this is worth a lot then.
[132:55.16]That's worth 80, so that's excellent.
[132:57.28]Okay, cool.
[132:59.67]That's really good.
[133:00.29]Alright, let's go back.
[133:03.63]I'm going to stay.
[133:04.96]No, you know what?
[133:06.60]No, you're coming.
[133:08.26]OK, you're an intern, but my legs are almost broke.
[133:11.90]I'm coming too.
[133:12.32]Oh wait, I think it's poke.
[133:16.94]Is this you?
[133:21.08]Oh no, it's Vinny.
[133:23.80]Are they in here?
[133:26.35]Not yet.
[133:53.97]We're coming in here with no light, no walkie talkies, no nothing.
[133:58.37]Nothing.
[134:01.25]Any?
[134:01.35]I don't know why I did that.
[134:04.11]Just got really quiet.
[134:06.12]Yeah.
[134:11.36]Guys?
[134:11.96]Is that you?
[134:13.90]Hello?
[134:16.02]Poke?
[134:19.08]Oh boy.
[134:27.81]Should we turn?
[134:29.47]I don't know.
[134:32.29]They're not in here.
[134:33.39]Are they outside?
[134:33.95]I'm just going to look around, I guess.
[134:36.97]Be careful.
[134:37.49]Just going to get a little death jerk.
[134:44.33]Steve Lee infected.
[134:45.70]Oh, God.
[134:46.90]Okay.
[134:47.08]I'm not going to be out that way.
[134:52.10]What was that?
[134:54.58]Please tell me that was you, sir, or Pope.
[134:58.70]Let's go back.
[134:59.28]Let's go back to the front.
[135:01.90]Go back to the front.
[135:02.34]Go back.
[135:02.54]Go, go, go.
[135:02.90]Back to the front.
[135:06.82]Anybody out here?
[135:09.28]Hello?
[135:13.23]Why would they do this to us?
[135:14.43]We're fucked.
[135:17.13]Alright, maybe we'll just go back.
[135:18.69]It's fine.
[135:20.57]We'll just go back.
[135:27.79]Yeah, we can look in the ship, right?
[135:30.76]Yeah, I'm just going to go into the ship and that's fine.
[135:33.62]We can just go there because I think we're getting real close to the enemies appearing.
[135:37.82]Yeah, and I don't want to mess around with that again.
[135:41.96]We already made so much money.
[135:43.22]We don't even need to be here.
[135:44.16]This is stupid.
[135:48.07]I don't think they're in here.
[135:49.49]Where did they go?
[135:50.63]Are they dead?
[135:51.87]Are they?
[135:52.25]Let's see.
[135:57.69]They are inside, currently, it looks like.
[136:00.55]And they're picking up yet green Doritos, which means that they're, you know, they're doing God's work.
[136:06.04]Okay, so they're alright.
[136:07.82]How do we unlock that door?
[136:08.90]There's a door.
[136:09.44]I think it's... Oh, yeah.
[136:11.46]How do we... On the terminal?
[136:16.18]Um... Other... We're gonna scare the shit out of them, by the way.
[136:20.19]They're gonna hear that and freak out.
[136:26.23]Ster is going...
[136:29.28]How do I switch cameras?
[136:35.14]I almost just started the ship.
[136:36.16]Oh, the white button.
[136:37.18]The white button.
[136:39.98]So if there's a door that has a number and it's red, we can open it by typing press open and then door number.
[136:47.92]Oh, okay.
[136:51.92]I almost pressed start ship.
[136:54.54]That would have been so awful.
[137:00.65]Oh my god.
[137:03.15]Nice.
[137:04.97]Wow, you came with plenty.
[137:07.52]Yeah, I did that.
[137:10.58]Ster's out there like a hero.
[137:12.28]Yeah.
[137:14.60]How do we ping Ster?
[137:15.56]Is there a way?
[137:16.12]You see the Doritos?
[137:17.40]That's loot.
[137:20.17]He's gonna see it.
[137:20.69]Oh, come on.
[137:22.73]He didn't see it.
[137:23.17]There we go.
[137:32.56]So how you guys feeling?
[137:34.84]Pretty good actually.
[137:36.06]This time we actually didn't all die.
[137:38.76]Yeah, we kind of ran back to the ship because it was getting late and we were like, no, this is bad.
[137:43.56]We were afraid.
[137:45.14]Yeah, just cowards.
[137:46.88]It's alright though.
[137:52.49]The doors can't open or close without the apparatus.
[137:55.55]Oh.
[138:03.07]6 o'clock.
[138:06.91]No sign of Ster at all.
[138:08.53]That Ster is kind of getting lost.
[138:10.29]What is he doing?
[138:11.17]He needs to come home now.
[138:18.12]Where is he?
[138:18.76]Going in circles.
[138:22.84]Oh wait, wait, he's outside.
[138:23.84]He's outside.
[138:24.32]He found the fire escape or fire exit, I think.
[138:28.10]We might we might alright.
[138:29.16]We might be right if Ster Ster can just find the ship.
[138:33.70]Come on Ster you can do it.
[138:37.18]Come on.
[138:39.13]We could teleport him with a teleporter.
[138:51.20]Oh 7 o'clock.
[138:54.94]He made it.
[138:57.30]You did it, Star.
[138:57.98]I can't believe it.
[138:58.82]We were watching your progress.
[139:00.04]I got like one thing.
[139:02.03]Hey.
[139:03.25]I got a key too, I guess.
[139:04.65]You're a hero.
[139:05.23]But I used the key.
[139:06.17]It's better than nothing.
[139:08.15]Teleporter only brings the body and not the items I found out.
[139:12.07]Yep.
[139:13.30]Which is still good because you lose money for not recovering bodies.
[139:16.66]Hey guys, we're rich.
[139:18.32]Almost.
[139:18.52]Alright, let's get out of here.
[139:20.18]Oh, hell yeah.
[139:20.72]Alright, let's go.
[139:29.29]Hey, do you guys mind if this next round I sit in the base with the walkie-talkie and eat my Chipotle?
[139:36.65]That's fine by me.
[139:37.69]What's your order?
[139:38.49]What did you get?
[139:39.81]I don't know.
[139:40.15]I got a burritos.
[139:40.85]I haven't had one in a long time.
[139:43.48]Alright.
[139:45.88]A burrito with like just... I don't know.
[139:49.08]I'm craving a burrito.
[139:52.14]Wait, so you don't have it yet?
[139:53.92]It just got here.
[139:56.53]What's in it?
[139:57.01]Yeah, what's in it?
[139:59.98]uh I think it's rice and stuff like just I don't know did you order it I didn't order it it's a surprise I'll let you guys know surprise burrito should we sell and get walkie-talkies so he can guide us even mean wait how much money do we have actually do you check the store
[140:22.15]Oh, we have no money.
[140:23.49]Yeah, let's go sell this stuff.
[140:24.55]We should sell, get stuff, and then Poke can guide us, no?
[140:29.55]If we sell now, though, it's less money if it's not on the last day.
[140:32.89]Oh, God.
[140:33.07]Got it, got it, got it.
[140:35.70]But, I mean, it'll still be enough for Yoda.
[140:37.42]I mean, we gotta get you a walkie-talkie, though, because then you can eat and guide us, right?
[140:41.80]Did we just land back on the same planet?
[140:45.50]It's the only one that isn't eclipsed in, like, something.
[140:48.18]Let me check.
[140:51.51]It's always dark, people are saying.
[140:53.13]I mean, fuck yeah.
[140:57.25]I'm just going to speed run this burrito while we're in there.
[141:00.59]No.
[141:00.83]Well, I mean, enjoy your meal.
[141:02.47]You can open doors for us and then when you're done, you can come back.
[141:05.35]Yeah, you're right.
[141:06.31]Enjoy your food.
[141:07.09]We'll be good.
[141:10.38]Alright.
[141:14.80]Okay.
[141:16.00]Leave loot at the front and I'll go pick it up.
[141:17.68]Okay.
[141:18.72]Okay.
[141:18.88]Alright.
[141:21.30]Good luck, gentlemen.
[141:21.86]Do not die.
[141:23.20]Enjoy your burritos.
[141:24.24]We'll do our best.
[141:27.28]I'm going to say that.
[141:31.72]Sighted against it.
[141:34.32]There are bees.
[141:34.92]There's a beehive right next to the ship.
[141:37.78]Make sure we get that after.
[141:39.72]Hey, hey, hey.
[141:41.72]Here's the thing with beehives is I learned this the hard way.
[141:45.02]If you try and collect the beehive and put it in the ship, the bees come inside the ship and kill everyone.
[141:48.90]So you have to get them at the end.
[141:51.06]So you put the beehive in the ship and then press mash the take off button?
[141:56.99]Pretty much.
[141:57.37]You gotta shut the door.
[141:58.19]Don't let the bees in.
[142:01.43]That is a terrifying thing to do.
[142:08.41]Yep.
[142:09.11]I found nothing, never mind.
[142:13.42]Nothing in here?
[142:14.30]Alright.
[142:15.10]It looks like there would be stuff in here, right?
[142:18.92]Uh, sir, what does this do if I flip the switch?
[142:21.74]Uh, it turns off the lights.
[142:24.44]Everything should be to the left.
[142:26.00]We're good.
[142:27.46]But, like, if there's guns, turrets at some point, you can shut the power.
[142:30.62]This is a weird room.
[142:34.14]This is like, uh, Ludwig's room in House Flipper.
[142:37.38]Oh, yeah.
[142:39.51]This doesn't belong here.
[142:41.79]This is actually, like, the room.
[142:45.04]I was going to say, this is like David Lynch room.
[142:47.44]It's just like some weird meat baby exists in there.
[142:50.40]By the way, in a week or so, I'm going to be setting up some teams for the House Flipper 2 Invitational.
[142:57.59]If you want to be in it, if you want to play, please, by all means.
[143:00.51]Ster, you weren't in the first one, but you... Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[143:03.75]Ah, that guy can come.
[143:05.09]What happened?
[143:05.73]Stay in here.
[143:06.31]Trust me.
[143:07.13]What was it?
[143:08.07]Stay in here.
[143:08.57]Trust me.
[143:08.97]I don't see anything.
[143:13.35]Okay.
[143:20.62]He's probably not going to come get any of this.
[143:34.52]Are you going to allow people to use glitches in this one?
[143:36.59]Are you going to let people fucking cheat in this one, Jerma?
[143:41.39]The rules will be... This is one of those things that you don't look at them.
[143:46.89]Where's Vinny?
[143:47.23]I'm not looking.
[143:48.13]I'm not looking.
[143:48.65]I'm here.
[143:49.09]I'm here.
[143:49.69]I got a key.
[143:50.49]I'm not looking.
[143:51.11]Ster, where are you going?
[143:54.09]I'm buying items.
[143:59.64]Are you guys scared of like a little Slender Man?
[144:01.50]It's not.
[144:02.48]It's like a Liminal Man.
[144:03.82]Like a Skibidi Liminal.
[144:05.48]A Skibbital.
[144:08.88]Sorry I said that.
[144:16.41]What do I do?
[144:16.89]Can I get it off him?
[144:18.43]It's on his head.
[144:18.99]One of those things is on his head.
[144:20.43]Ster, where are you?
[144:22.09]Ster, where are you?
[144:24.63]Ster, where are you?
[144:27.11]I can't help you.
[144:29.17]I can't help you.
[144:31.51]You're dead, dude.
[144:32.55]Ster, where are you?
[144:35.60]Hey, there's a... But don't come in here.
[144:38.78]There's one of those things behind me.
[144:41.14]What?
[144:41.48]What?
[144:42.02]One of those things is behind me, the things that you don't look at.
[144:43.82]It's right behind me.
[144:44.74]Just be careful.
[144:45.46]Right next to me, to the right behind me, to my right.
[144:49.52]Don't put that flashlight in here.
[144:52.24]Back on me.
[144:53.06]Oh, he actually did get it.
[144:54.18]Yeah, Vinny's dead.
[144:57.03]We gotta bring his body back.
[144:59.03]You wanna grab his body?
[145:00.15]Yeah, yep.
[145:01.19]I don't know if you can make this jump with a body, though.
[145:07.77]Do you have any items?
[145:10.11]No, I haven't found anything.
[145:12.14]Okay, well... There's a key here.
[145:18.99]Okay, can you do anything if somebody has one of those things on their head?
[145:22.21]Uh, I don't know.
[145:24.59]Maybe you can shovel hit it.
[145:26.39]Oh.
[145:28.39]You'd have to scan the hook behind the spine.
[145:30.39]Don't look at it.
[145:31.23]Yep.
[145:31.47]Yep.
[145:31.79]Yeah.
[145:32.01]I'm not looking anywhere.
[145:32.63]I'm looking right at you.
[145:33.61]Look at me.
[145:33.97]You and me.
[145:34.69]We're here together.
[145:35.23]We're going forward.
[145:35.91]We're working here.
[145:37.19]We're going to get some stuff.
[145:37.95]We're going to bring Vinny back.
[145:38.63]We're going to bring him back to life.
[145:39.83]Let's go back.
[145:40.55]Let's try and find our way back.
[145:41.61]I got a metal sheet.
[145:42.31]But back up.
[145:42.93]Yeah.
[145:43.39]Don't look.
[145:44.03]Back up.
[145:46.09]Okay.
[145:46.87]Oh, okay.
[145:47.73]Okay.
[145:48.93]Should we back up and not look?
[145:52.49]Um... If I back up and just go backwards, will he see me?
[146:01.58]Keep going.
[146:02.52]You're good.
[146:03.13]Turn around and run to the door.
[146:09.39]Oh god, okay.
[146:10.05]I think we gotta go left.
[146:15.45]Oh, I didn't scan it.
[146:16.51]Shit.
[146:19.15]It's on game.
[146:19.73]We're out.
[146:21.01]I was too afraid to scan it.
[146:22.43]I'm sorry, guys.
[146:24.54]We're gonna leave the body for poke.
[146:27.68]Are you going back in?
[146:29.06]Should we go back in?
[146:30.00]That's kind of funny.
[146:31.48]That's very funny.
[146:32.20]He's going to come.
[146:32.68]He's going to be eating his burrito.
[146:33.74]He's going to come to do a collection and he's going to be like, oh, fuck.
[146:36.30]Okay.
[146:39.90]Up to you.
[146:40.28]Up to you, boss.
[146:41.04]If you want to go back in.
[146:41.84]I think we're already over quota.
[146:43.10]That's true.
[146:43.66]We are.
[146:43.90]Alright, let's go.
[146:46.62]Plus, it's already three o'clock.
[146:56.21]What about the beehive?
[146:59.03]uh we can try and get that but I would like to just do quota one so we can get some money so where do you want to do it we uh we lost them yeah I think we're gonna go uh turn in get uh some flashlights and stuff
[147:32.55]163.
[147:32.57]Nice.
[147:34.67]Please use the shelf.
[147:35.91]The shelf is for flashlights and accessories, not for junk.
[147:41.60]You don't neatly stack your junk.
[147:45.36]You ever watch Hoarders?
[147:48.44]Do you guys like beans?
[147:50.77]I like beans.
[147:51.77]What kind?
[147:53.95]Just like black beans.
[147:55.39]Oh, yeah.
[147:59.05]It to me a burrito.
[148:00.63]I want it fully loaded.
[148:01.69]I want beans, salsa, queso, chicken.
[148:07.60]Cilantro, sour cream, everything.
[148:16.36]I want to be able to hold that thing with two hands.
[148:20.38]Tell me about it.
[148:24.47]Story of my life.
[148:26.45]It sounds cool, but like it's too much.
[148:35.40]Jean lit.
[148:36.80]Someone called me a Jean lit because I said cilantro tastes like soap to me.
[148:42.41]No, you have that.
[148:43.31]You do have the gene.
[148:45.25]Yeah, Jean lit.
[148:47.17]What is going on?
[148:58.10]Ding!
[149:01.08]Guess who's back?
[149:02.16]Me.
[149:03.11]Back again.
[149:04.27]Nice.
[149:08.13]We can deposit our stuff.
[149:10.41]I still have cilantro on things from time to time.
[149:12.73]I like a little soap in my burritos.
[149:15.44]I don't like a lot, but a little is good.
[149:17.02]A little goes a long way.
[149:18.76]A little is good, yeah.
[149:22.66]You don't like soap?
[149:27.12]Not usually on my tongue, but you know.
[149:30.68]I do have pizza soap.
[149:32.64]These are all being counted, right?
[149:39.04]It's like a novelty soap that smells like pizza and you, you know.
[149:43.83]It's weird.
[149:44.41]It's real dumb.
[149:46.23]Everything good to go?
[149:48.93]That's me.
[149:49.33]Can you smash that like button?
[149:52.64]Can you buy that or does someone send it to you?
[149:54.96]Do you want to smash the bell?
[149:56.64]Smash that bell.
[149:57.92]Smash the bell.
[149:59.00]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[150:00.61]What would you do to a subscribe button?
[150:03.29]I would unsubscribe from your channel.
[150:08.99]Okay.
[150:09.39]I don't want to see those notifications from you anymore.
[150:12.47]I feel like I've been very helpful today.
[150:14.29]I don't want to press the bell on your video.
[150:16.77]Is your name short for sternum?
[150:19.11]Oh my god, we're rich.
[150:25.69]Wait, I think we lose the money.
[150:26.79]Do we?
[150:27.87]We lose the money?
[150:28.77]No, we got $400.
[150:29.27]What do you want to buy?
[150:30.65]Do you want to buy the teleporter?
[150:32.71]And some walkies.
[150:33.45]Do we keep the extra after the quota?
[150:37.05]Uh, yeah.
[150:38.59]Oh, shovel's 40% off.
[150:40.67]That's a steal.
[150:42.91]How much is it?
[150:43.47]Get two of those.
[150:44.19]Get one for me.
[150:46.85]Let's just get the teleporter.
[150:48.23]Let's get four of them.
[150:49.03]Let's just go in there with a fully load out, fully loaded.
[150:52.69]They are heavy.
[150:54.24]We should save some money for the crazy planet though.
[150:57.58]I think that could be worth.
[150:59.46]Stern is expensive.
[151:01.97]Short for sterile.
[151:03.67]Are you guys worthy of pro flashlights?
[151:06.59]Yes.
[151:07.41]I don't know what that means.
[151:09.37]Gangster.
[151:10.37]Can I just use the kids one?
[151:15.39]Stenis.
[151:17.51]What?
[151:20.75]Chat, you're saying weird things.
[151:22.41]Stop that.
[151:23.38]Gotta go grab it.
[151:24.36]Gotta go grab it.
[151:31.60]Yeah, so my name's short for sternum.
[151:36.90]Where's the stuff?
[151:39.57]Uh, I think... Oh, grabbed it.
[151:41.11]There's gonna be another one coming.
[151:42.85]Oh, he already got it.
[151:47.07]You want the shovel?
[151:51.97]Why would you drop it down there?
[151:59.81]That's a good one.
[152:01.11]Hey, high five.
[152:02.69]High five.
[152:04.79]Nice, dude.
[152:07.49]That is a bright flashlight.
[152:09.37]That's a prank.
[152:13.54]Just a prank, bro.
[152:16.94]So what if I have four flashlights?
[152:22.87]I got all the flashlights.
[152:23.73]This three, right?
[152:25.42]Alright, go put them in the cabinet.
[152:27.42]Yep.
[152:32.28]Oh my goodness, that thing is bright.
[152:35.42]There should have been four.
[152:37.23]I have some here.
[152:43.19]We did it.
[152:44.47]We got a lot of money.
[152:45.79]I don't even know what half the stuff is.
[152:47.07]The inhalant?
[152:47.87]I don't know what that is.
[152:49.26]Boombox?
[152:50.20]Why would you need a boombox?
[152:53.34]Extension ladder.
[152:55.47]Ladder?
[152:55.87]That sounds kind of good.
[152:58.37]Oh yeah, charge up the flashlights.
[153:02.59]That's true.
[153:03.99]We do need walkie-talkies.
[153:05.99]I'm ordering walkies and we'll leave and poke and eat his burritos.
[153:09.69]I'm done.
[153:10.09]I'm done eating.
[153:10.79]Already?
[153:11.86]I'm full.
[153:12.30]You inhaled that burritos.
[153:14.22]I really did.
[153:14.96]It was not the best one.
[153:17.32]I'm sad for you.
[153:19.12]What was the protein?
[153:20.08]Was there any protein in there or was it just bean?
[153:22.06]It was like steak.
[153:23.99]Okay, like steak.
[153:25.81]Oh, steakums?
[153:26.73]It's coming from Chipotle.
[153:28.72]Hey, you never know nowadays.
[153:30.16]They put fake meat everywhere.
[153:31.80]All this fake meat is not real.
[153:34.08]Do you remember when Taco Bell, there's accusations that they combine beef with oats and like cream to create their beef?
[153:42.29]Wasn't it like horse?
[153:43.89]Yeah, horse and like oat.
[153:45.59]That was Wendy's, right?
[153:46.41]I don't know.
[153:48.09]I didn't hear about that being Wendy's.
[153:49.49]I heard horse and... I think it was Wendy's.
[153:50.99]I don't want to get in trouble.
[153:54.78]I don't think Wendy's... Yeah, if Wendy's were to sue over that, that would be like an omission of guilt.
[154:00.20]So I think you're probably okay.
[154:02.23]Alright, let's go.
[154:03.19]We can always order more later.
[154:09.15]You guys ready to rock and roll?
[154:11.77]Yeah.
[154:12.01]I don't know if you guys know this, but STER is short for, uh... Stereotype.
[154:18.60]Oh, that's pretty good.
[154:20.78]I always thought it was for a stenographer.
[154:23.48]Did anyone say sternum?
[154:25.34]Yeah, I kind of did.
[154:27.70]Steroids.
[154:28.74]That's the bit.
[154:34.36]What a rage!
[154:35.60]Don't minus tune me in my own chat.
[154:37.74]You can do that anywhere else, but not here.
[154:40.67]Alright, we got to get 244 in this.
[154:42.67]We got three days for 244.
[154:45.49]We got this.
[154:46.11]We're going to be going down to a foggy map.
[154:50.25]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[154:51.23]Is it the only option?
[154:54.23]I didn't go foggy.
[154:55.89]I'm not doing that ever again.
[154:57.06]Do we all have a powerful flashlight now?
[155:01.30]What?
[155:01.86]We all have a powerful flashlight now, right?
[155:03.28]Are we all going to... Oh, yeah.
[155:05.76]There's troubles.
[155:06.54]We can use them to bury the bodies.
[155:08.08]I mean, the moth bugs.
[155:10.83]Wait, which one is powerful?
[155:12.65]Yeller.
[155:13.33]The yellow one is the pro flashlight.
[155:15.43]I'm colorblind.
[155:16.81]I don't know which one's yellow.
[155:17.91]I really don't know.
[155:20.37]I'm going to hit you in the head with the shovel.
[155:21.53]I'm size blind.
[155:22.39]I don't know which one's more big.
[155:24.33]Yeah, well, I'm a size queen.
[155:29.01]You grabbed the shovel post.
[155:30.01]You killed four.
[155:30.79]I feel like you're the shovel guy.
[155:32.07]I've been told by my chat that two talkies at a time is good enough.
[155:37.43]Okay, so who has a talkie?
[155:39.23]I want room.
[155:40.09]I got one.
[155:43.69]I have a flashlight and a shovel.
[155:44.81]Should I put the shovel down?
[155:47.99]Roger.
[155:50.45]I'll take a talkie.
[155:51.11]I'm going to put the shovel down and take a talkie.
[155:53.79]Okay.
[155:54.11]And I'll have a key.
[155:57.37]Let's go.
[155:57.85]Let's get this money.
[156:00.36]I'm trying to buy a Lambo.
[156:04.56]I think it's this way again.
[156:06.30]What's Lambo short for?
[156:07.42]Lambography.
[156:10.50]Lambonguini.
[156:11.58]It's a type of pasta.
[156:13.17]I would know.
[156:13.59]I'm Italian.
[156:15.07]I never had that though.
[156:18.96]Hey, did you know that spaghetti is the singular of spaghetti?
[156:24.25]I did.
[156:24.56]What's your guys' favorite kind of pasta?
[156:26.18]Spaghetti.
[156:30.77]I like angel hair.
[156:31.85]I fooled your wife into thinking you're Italian.
[156:33.71]Really?
[156:34.01]Yeah, I don't know how it happened.
[156:35.73]This bridge is going to kill us.
[156:36.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[156:40.17]One by one.
[156:40.95]I don't remember a whole lot, buddy.
[156:42.73]When I talked about my parents thought they were Italian because they watched The Sopranos and they lived in New Jersey.
[156:47.57]Oh, we did talk about that.
[156:48.73]No, we're running.
[156:49.19]We talked about like various places.
[156:50.93]Alright.
[156:51.53]One at a time.
[156:55.65]Is it safe for me?
[156:56.17]This thing is shaking a lot.
[156:58.85]Let's shake it and scare him.
[156:59.89]Hey.
[157:04.84]Alright, guys, let's get that quota.
[157:06.20]Let's get that money.
[157:06.86]Everybody in.
[157:07.36]Let's go.
[157:07.74]Let's go.
[157:08.08]Let's go.
[157:09.44]We're in.
[157:13.64]We don't want to go that way.
[157:15.06]Whoa!
[157:18.13]Hey, missed me.
[157:19.01]Huh.
[157:23.70]Maybe we do want to go that way.
[157:25.48]Maybe that's where all the loot is if we run by it.
[157:28.33]There's some glowing eyes right down there.
[157:31.71]That's your problem.
[157:33.47]I am not going that way.
[157:35.23]Hell no.
[157:36.87]I'm farming the minus twos tonight.
[157:38.64]I love it.
[157:39.54]Where are the eyes?
[157:40.12]Yeah, where are the eyes?
[157:40.92]The eyes are down this way.
[157:48.00]I would rather go past the turret.
[157:50.50]Are we going to run by the turret?
[157:51.90]What was that?
[157:53.02]Another turret.
[157:53.62]Be careful.
[157:54.10]Don't go this way.
[157:54.73]Don't go this way.
[157:55.87]Or if you do, run.
[157:57.57]Oh, there's another turret.
[157:58.57]There's a guy.
[157:59.19]There's a guy.
[157:59.81]There's a guy.
[158:02.59]What's happening?
[158:03.29]There's a guy over there too.
[158:05.55]Around that corner.
[158:11.74]Wait, that wasn't a guy?
[158:12.72]That was a shadow of a guy that was on the corner.
[158:14.52]It was a scary monster.
[158:15.42]It's a shi- It's a- That's how light works!
[158:18.92]Alright, watch this.
[158:19.60]Alright, here we go.
[158:22.31]Watch this.
[158:26.41]Oh shit!
[158:28.65]The guy was around the corner!
[158:30.81]I told you there was a guy and nobody believed me!
[158:33.55]Nobody believed me that there was a guy!
[158:34.63]Here we go.
[158:37.62]I told you there was a guy!
[158:41.40]I want a written apology from Starthus.
[158:46.08]Jesus!
[158:46.58]Oh, God.
[158:48.00]Yup, duh, there it is.
[158:49.54]There's Tarthus everywhere, though.
[158:52.22]Where's the guy?
[158:53.02]Don't look at him.
[158:55.33]Oh, shit.
[158:56.33]Oh, oh, oh, oh!
[158:59.53]Is he dead?
[158:59.95]Is he dead?
[159:00.47]Is he dead?
[159:00.77]I'm gonna- I'm gonna- I'm gonna pick up his- I'm gonna- He got fuckin' electrocuted.
[159:06.57]Dude, something just, like, evaporated him with electricity.
[159:10.09]Hey, guys, guys, guys, guys.
[159:11.33]Jerma, you want a tag team?
[159:12.81]Give me the shovel.
[159:14.27]Uhhh, hold on.
[159:14.89]This seems like a terrible idea.
[159:18.28]Open this door, I'm gonna sprint to- I'm gonna sprint.
[159:20.04]Okay, go!
[159:20.66]This seems such a bad idea.
[159:22.34]Ah!
[159:31.74]Metal Gear Solid
[159:52.66]Because it was like higher than a crouch.
[159:54.24]That was solid fucking snake.
[159:55.40]Sharma got turned into a blood mist.
[159:57.02]And I got hit by the Skibidi bliminal man.
[159:59.52]So.
[160:01.82]Oh, we lost everything.
[160:03.22]No, no, no.
[160:04.76]Look.
[160:06.28]We're good.
[160:06.96]Well, we got a couple things.
[160:09.40]Okay.
[160:10.02]This is.
[160:10.74]I don't want to misquote it again.
[160:11.92]We need to get to the later stages.
[160:13.27]Oh, my fucking stomach hurts.
[160:16.59]Oh.
[160:17.73]How did I die?
[160:18.31]Do you guys see it?
[160:19.13]You.
[160:19.73]Yeah, you got grabbed by the Slenderman.
[160:22.13]Oh, my God.
[160:22.73]Your voice when you got grabbed, Polk, it was like... You got zapped out of existence.
[160:30.37]It was fucking so funny.
[160:31.25]You got grabbed by Slender?
[160:32.95]Yeah, yeah.
[160:33.77]Okay, me too.
[160:34.59]Gotcha.
[160:37.35]The neck snap that he did to you, Vinny, was so perfect.
[160:41.25]He waited for the... The comedic timing of this game is unreal.
[160:44.49]What a piece of shit that guy is.
[160:45.61]This game has the screaming before death thing perfect.
[160:48.55]Like, just perfect.
[160:51.09]Ugh.
[160:58.43]I think it was a dead end, too.
[161:00.27]Like, I couldn't... I don't think there was anywhere to go.
[161:06.68]Is it me or Ster keeps deciding to speak when it's loading?
[161:09.74]Every time.
[161:11.18]Every time.
[161:11.62]Every time.
[161:12.12]You guys look at the sun?
[161:18.15]Up there?
[161:18.83]What about it?
[161:19.49]Um...
[161:20.31]Is that kind of weird looking?
[161:21.23]A little bit.
[161:22.27]It's alright.
[161:22.55]It's probably fine.
[161:23.67]Just look at it.
[161:24.21]Enjoy it.
[161:24.55]It's like a radar blip.
[161:25.41]Does anybody have a walkie-talkie?
[161:26.91]I'm being told that that slender enemy... No.
[161:29.79]We lost them all.
[161:31.13]We got two.
[161:32.41]We got two walkie-talkies.
[161:33.39]We got two.
[161:34.37]You got a flashlight.
[161:35.09]I'm listening.
[161:36.17]I'm being told that that slender enemy, you have to look at it for a little bit, but not too long.
[161:42.23]Oh, my God.
[161:43.09]Look away.
[161:43.91]No, no, guys.
[161:44.37]Come here.
[161:44.61]Come here.
[161:46.33]Come here.
[161:46.72]I'll hook up you.
[161:52.56]I mean, I'll say, I mean, okay.
[161:53.92]Yeah, just type.
[161:54.82]We'll do it next time.
[161:56.10]We'll do it next time.
[161:57.08]Sorry, sorry.
[161:57.60]Daylight's burning, man.
[161:59.02]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[161:59.92]Poke, you have a walkie-talkie, right?
[162:02.14]No, I have nothing.
[162:02.86]That's fine.
[162:03.97]I have a flashlight.
[162:05.31]What do you think about games using a... I'm the only person with a walkie-talkie.
[162:11.93]I gotta get rid of this thing.
[162:17.05]I'm talking to myself.
[162:20.95]Oh, fuck bugs.
[162:22.19]I'm fine.
[162:31.47]Wait, Ster has one shit.
[162:45.67]OK.
[162:45.79]Why is it so quiet?
[162:52.78]Yeah, you're fine.
[162:53.60]I'm here.
[162:54.46]Jeremiah, there are landmines.
[162:56.96]There are land... They're in here?
[162:59.83]Landmines.
[163:01.11]What do they look like?
[163:02.79]Oh, God.
[163:03.49]If you want to come down here, it's beeping at the corner of the door.
[163:06.87]It's a dead end.
[163:07.75]You don't need to go in, but that's what it looks like.
[163:10.41]Oh, okay.
[163:10.69]So it's like a frisbee on the ground.
[163:12.11]Whoa, it blinked.
[163:18.04]Dead end.
[163:18.56]Dead end.
[163:19.02]Dead end.
[163:19.32]Who builds these places?
[163:20.78]Uh, guys, there's two landmines up here.
[163:22.34]I don't know if we want to... Go back there.
[163:24.48]Go back there.
[163:29.24]Now I'm paranoid about landmines.
[163:31.32]Yep.
[163:31.70]Yep.
[163:32.32]Be careful.
[163:33.84]I'm going to step on one of those fucking things.
[163:35.38]I know it.
[163:35.90]There's a lot of them.
[163:38.30]Oh, is it dead?
[163:38.64]Okay.
[163:41.66]People are saying... I mean, if we could pick up and sell landmines on this whole place, it's like, where are we going?
[163:45.62]Can you actually pick them up or no?
[163:49.09]I don't know.
[163:50.25]Can they be disarmed?
[163:52.29]To my knowledge, no, but maybe there's an item that lets you.
[163:54.99]An engine.
[163:56.61]Oh my god.
[163:56.85]You alright?
[164:00.94]You scared me.
[164:04.14]Let's go this way.
[164:09.68]I'm right behind you, Ster.
[164:12.60]It's the soundproof room.
[164:14.72]I haven't seen anything on the ground.
[164:18.15]Where the hell is everything?
[164:20.57]Shut the door behind you.
[164:23.50]Ow.
[164:24.84]Not a good idea.
[164:25.98]You guys okay?
[164:28.58]Yeah, I'm okay.
[164:30.42]You jump down here.
[164:34.45]Right here.
[164:35.81]Ster, hold on a minute.
[164:36.65]I'm going to die if I fall down here, right?
[164:40.01]Yeah.
[164:40.79]Can you give me a light?
[164:42.77]I'll miss this if I don't.
[164:47.61]You're good.
[164:47.95]You're good.
[164:48.37]You're good, Buster.
[164:54.93]It's really quiet when you do that.
[164:56.23]I thought I saw something, you know?

[165:49.99]There's a gurgling.

[166:19.70]Right back behind you guys.
[166:22.24]Let's go to the fire exit.
[166:23.12]Let's do it.
[166:26.54]Let's make a run back.
[166:31.22]Do you have... Who has room?
[166:33.48]I need to turn.
[166:34.28]I got room.
[166:34.74]I got room.
[166:35.64]I got room if you need me to grab some stuff.
[166:38.79]If you want to make a run back, I want to keep looking.
[166:41.27]Anybody got anything else?
[166:41.93]I want to recharge the flashlight.
[166:43.25]I think two of us should go back.
[166:46.50]Two of us should stay.
[166:47.22]Alright, Vinny, we'll go.
[166:48.12]Ster, do you want the shovel?
[166:49.92]In case there's any danger?
[166:50.88]Sure.
[166:51.20]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[166:52.24]Any more items?
[166:53.90]I have a flashlight, but it's about dead.
[166:55.76]So I'm going to recharge it.
[166:58.90]Here, come back with that flashlight as well.
[167:00.75]There's something here.
[167:02.49]Something was running at me.
[167:07.16]Okay.
[167:07.40]What was it?
[167:08.26]What was it?
[167:08.86]I think it was the... It was like a... It sounded like the one guy.
[167:11.54]Alright, Vinny.
[167:13.98]We'll deposit.
[167:14.52]We got to make sure we make some money.
[167:15.84]Yeah, we got some stuff we got to do and then we'll... We'll come back to you.
[167:21.00]It's past four.
[167:22.42]I don't think they should be back in... Oh, boy.
[167:27.99]We're... This is going to be scary.
[167:31.35]Yeah, and it's already getting kind of late for them.
[167:34.19]So, I don't think it's a great idea.
[167:40.55]Find this on the ladder.
[167:42.19]On the ladder.
[167:48.73]You good?
[167:50.31]Yeah.
[167:59.88]That's a long fall.
[168:02.32]Oh no!
[168:03.74]Don't watch my stream.
[168:10.05]I don't think we can get these flashlights back to them.
[168:12.41]I don't think so either.
[168:12.91]Because by that time it's going to be past 6pm.
[168:17.25]Well, at least we can deposit this.
[168:19.35]Yeah.
[168:23.46]Something.
[168:26.12]Okay, money.
[168:27.50]Tickles.
[168:29.98]Charge the light.
[168:30.68]Should we go try to help them?
[168:32.88]Probably not.
[168:33.52]It's a terrible idea.
[168:35.32]Well, how about this?
[168:36.56]Let's take a look and see what's going on on their screen there.
[168:39.18]Yeah, where are they?
[168:40.58]They're already outside.
[168:41.56]Oh shit, they're headed.
[168:43.56]Yeah, they're headed this way, so I think we'll be alright.
[168:47.38]Kind of a boss town.
[168:48.34]There's nothing really in there.
[168:50.90]Yeah, oh wait.
[168:52.51]Oh, they're there.
[168:54.19]Anything?
[168:55.65]A little bit.
[168:57.05]How much?
[169:05.31]What the fuck just happened?
[169:06.83]Oh, my head.
[169:14.07]I'm going back.
[169:15.05]I'm going to rush.
[169:16.53]No!
[169:16.95]You get on the monitor and tell me if you see anything.
[169:20.01]Wait, Sturt, take a flashlight.
[169:21.45]Do you have a flashlight?
[169:23.95]No, he's going to tell me where to go.
[169:25.09]I got a walkie.
[169:26.03]What?
[169:26.23]Take a flashlight.
[169:27.23]Are you mad?
[169:28.11]Oh.
[169:30.43]Sturt, this is a bad idea.
[169:32.01]He's gone already.
[169:37.60]I don't know what you just said, but copy that.
[169:48.35]Okay.
[169:50.23]Roger, go in and then I can do that.
[169:57.31]Wilco Schmilko, got it.
[169:59.29]Roger.
[170:00.38]Oh, check this out.
[170:01.72]There's a Dorito.
[170:04.14]It's to your left.
[170:06.18]There's a monster coming out behind you.
[170:08.18]There's a red dot soon.
[170:10.42]Ster.
[170:10.94]Go in the computer and type view monitor.
[170:15.25]I mean, Ster.
[170:17.71]Anybody type it.
[170:20.01]It's straight ahead and then to the right.
[170:22.15]However, there's a red dot and then there's another red dot.
[170:30.29]He's so dead.
[170:31.09]You got this.
[170:31.97]Just go and then make a right.
[170:33.39]Yeah, make a right when you can.
[170:34.57]There's just a red dot, so you're gonna die probably.
[170:36.94]Cool.
[170:37.62]Over.
[170:39.02]I think it's the blob.
[170:40.56]Does he not see it?
[170:41.08]It's the blob.
[170:41.86]Okay, there's a green Dorito straight ahead.
[170:45.00]And then to your right.
[170:49.88]This is like the silent movie equivalent of this game.
[170:52.41]Just watching this.
[170:54.34]um you're that's because it's in a different spot over uh you probably want to go into that long pipe room and then there's some some green doritos over it's it's straight ahead and to the right over okay so it's to your right now if you can get on one of those pipes but there is a fast red movement over uh oh
[171:22.25]Fast red movement to your right!
[171:27.15]I need to play Pac-Man music over this.
[171:29.31]The autopilot is about to kick in, so you're fucked, but there are Doritos there, so you can get those and bring them back.
[171:41.90]Return to base now, Roger.
[171:46.02]Straight ahead!
[171:46.42]Go straight!
[171:46.68]Not that way, buddy.
[171:54.81]You want to go back where you came from?
[171:57.45]Make a right.
[171:58.19]Make a right.
[171:59.27]Straight ahead.
[172:03.98]Keep going in that direction.
[172:09.90]What was that noise?
[172:12.16]It's down.
[172:12.52]Watch it start playing.
[172:13.73]There's the blob coming up in a moment.
[172:15.41]Careful.
[172:16.17]Careful.
[172:16.57]And then you should be close to the exit, I think.
[172:18.69]Is that Pac-Man?
[172:20.22]WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED?
[172:24.18]WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING?
[172:25.30]WHAT HAPPENED?
[172:25.80]What the fuck happened?
[172:44.08]What?
[172:46.31]Oh my god, there's so many.
[172:54.27]I don't know.
[172:54.79]We were talking in there.
[172:56.29]What, we can't talk inside?
[172:58.48]We can't talk?
[173:01.10]We can't talk in the fucking, in the ship?
[173:04.58]What?
[173:09.96]I thought something was wrong!
[173:27.40]Maybe I'll play a funny alarm sound.
[173:31.19]The loudest noise coming from this mic and the dogs rush out.
[173:36.25]I was playing Pac-Man music over.
[173:38.21]I was watching the monitor and we were watching you do Pac-Man shit.
[173:43.83]I got out with something.
[173:45.45]I found a whole bunch of stuff, but it was midnight, like exactly when I left.
[173:48.83]Yeah, you were pretty much done anyway.
[173:51.33]It was really loud.
[173:52.97]We lost all of our money and we need $240 in a day.
[173:55.33]Yeah, we have one day.
[173:59.44]I need everyone's game face on.
[174:00.98]Dude, I didn't know.
[174:02.32]I thought we were safe.
[174:11.35]Playing Pac-Man sounds attracts the entire game to aggro to the ship apparently.
[174:15.29]Can you not close the door up to the ship?
[174:16.95]Oh, you can.
[174:17.98]We should have closed the door next time.
[174:21.04]Oh, but it has a timer until it opens again.
[174:23.52]Killed all of you?
[174:25.48]Yes!
[174:26.60]We should look at the clip or something, what happened?
[174:29.52]Yeah, they're turning into noise.
[174:31.25]Hold on, I gotta watch this.
[174:33.65]I just started hearing people screaming.
[174:34.93]I thought you guys were fucking with him over the walkie-talkie.
[174:39.09]Oh.
[174:47.91]Watch Poke- hold on, let me watch Poke's clip.
[174:51.39]I gotta get a different perspective here.
[174:52.73]Wait, sir, did you hear me screaming over the walkie-talkie?
[174:55.75]I wanna see... I wanna see, uh... I wanna see Vinny... Holy shit, guys.
[175:04.76]You're just on the fucking monitor, like, not knowing there's a dog behind you.
[175:12.54]He heard you screaming.
[175:13.54]Okay, you did hear it.
[175:14.50]Like, low-quality walkie-talkie.
[175:16.19]Yeah.
[175:17.60]I got, like, a last glimpse.
[175:19.70]Okay, we gotta land.
[175:20.99]This is... We really need, like... I'm so sorry.
[175:25.21]Yeah, we need everything.
[175:26.11]Hold on.
[175:31.43]I wanna see this other clip.
[175:36.11]There are 15 objects totaling 1,500.
[175:39.02]We can do this.
[175:42.40]We lost... I'm crying.
[175:46.04]I'm crying.
[175:50.41]I need to see from this perspective like oh which what is the wisdom where's oh we gotta go we gotta go we gotta go I'll put it up later oh my god where is everybody
[176:21.55]Where'd everybody go?
[176:22.13]Hello?
[176:24.82]Hey, where'd everybody go?
[176:29.28]Fuck!
[176:33.26]Where is everybody?
[176:33.94]Shit!
[176:34.86]Hey, where... Where... Where is everybody?
[176:46.53]Am I going the right way?
[176:51.77]Can anybody hear me?
[176:53.01]I don't know where I am.
[176:53.93]I have no idea which way I'm going.
[176:59.31]Oh.
[177:07.66]Ster.
[177:12.16]Poke, Viddy, does anybody have a walkie-talkie on them?
[177:15.32]I wasn't paying attention where you guys went.
[177:16.52]I was laughing at a clip, a funny thing that I saw.
[177:28.56]Guys!
[177:28.94]Alright, I'm gonna go back.
[177:32.11]I'm gonna go back.
[177:36.91]Nobody has a walkie-talkie.
[177:49.55]I'm just gonna go to the base.
[177:51.25]I'm gonna go to the base and watch the clip.
[177:52.71]That sounds fun.
[177:56.13]We can watch.
[177:57.95]I want to see it from the other perspective because I had no idea what the hell was going on.
[178:10.74]Okay, let me see.
[178:21.19]In a moment.
[178:27.36]God, that's so fucking loud.
[178:29.60]I didn't know it was coming through that loud.
[178:31.16]That's coming through insanely loud.
[178:37.22]Hold on.
[178:45.17]God damn, that's funny.
[178:49.75]Oh, shit.
[178:50.21]Okay, hold on.
[178:59.49]Okay, I'm getting it on stream, I promise.
[179:04.48]Okay.
[179:07.64]You should be able to see it.
[179:08.80]Well, not yet.
[179:09.28]I have not, I've yet to see this, so.
[179:19.89]Oh.
[179:27.61]Why is this crop so weird?
[179:28.97]Okay.
[179:37.26]okay there we go alright I haven't seen this yet let's see it's going to be loud so just be aware coming up in a moment careful and then you should be close to the exit I think what the is happening
[180:06.50]Oh my god, that's fucking ridiculous.
[180:09.28]Hold on.
[180:11.68]I lost you guys and we were watching the clip.
[180:20.03]I know, but I got lost and I didn't want to fucking kill myself with you and not have, you know what I mean?
[180:24.29]I didn't want to die.
[180:26.16]That is so goddamn funny.
[180:27.64]Alright, I'm ready to help.
[180:30.20]I'm ready to help.
[180:30.64]No, we're not.
[180:31.24]We're fine.
[180:31.62]We're fine.
[180:32.38]We're fine.
[180:33.02]We're good.
[180:33.32]We're good.
[180:35.77]I was calling on the walkie-talkie, nobody had one!
[180:37.55]I, I, I, does nobody have a walkie-talkie?
[180:46.22]I pinged like a thousand times.
[180:47.90]No, we're out of things.
[180:51.90]Oh, that's so funny.
[180:56.28]It's already 3 p.m., man.
[180:57.30]We haven't found a single thing in there.
[180:58.76]I'm gonna be in the shower later and just gonna think about that happening.
[181:04.04]This guy's getting a demotion and he's already like an intern.
[181:07.94]Oh, who cares?
[181:08.76]OK.
[181:21.13]So where is everybody at?
[181:24.51]Yeah, there's also a big spider right behind him I told you there's a spot for a key if you follow me we can possibly we could use it The door was closed
[181:53.69]I know, spiders can open doors.
[181:55.43]They can?
[181:56.29]Yeah.
[181:59.35]I thought you opened it.
[182:01.31]Brave jump.
[182:02.87]That's a brave-ass jump.
[182:04.79]The bravest man making a brave-ass jump.
[182:07.09]Such a grown-ass jump, honestly.
[182:09.67]My fucking head hurts.
[182:12.47]God damn it.
[182:15.11]I've been thinking about it, man, and, uh, listen, like, what I said about Bandcamp was so wrong.
[182:21.67]Oh, that's cool.
[182:22.95]Um, I don't remember what you said.
[182:24.09]Take the cookies!
[182:27.82]Take the cookies!
[182:28.76]Take the cookies with me!
[182:30.20]Take the cookies with me!
[182:33.18]Where are you?!
[182:35.54]He's like holding a tray of muffins!
[182:37.04]I didn't see what happened here.
[182:39.34]Oh, there's only two left.
[182:41.16]He's got a fucking muffin tray!
[182:42.68]Like, that's not gonna be any money!
[182:45.44]No, if he brings the muffin tray back, we win.
[182:50.01]No, we need like all, we need like a hundred, 230.
[182:52.47]Yep.
[182:53.05]That thing is not worth 230.
[182:59.23]I'm sorry.
[182:59.97]I just, I can't get over the last 15 minutes.
[183:02.17]It's just hard for me to get over it.
[183:08.79]I think we're going to get a, he would have to recover all three bodies.
[183:11.33]You should just vote to leave early.
[183:13.39]Yeah, but we get to see Poke's fun ending here.
[183:16.41]He's very scared.
[183:22.28]Hello?
[183:22.50]Hello?
[183:22.70]Oh man.
[183:24.28]I'm surprised there's no first person
[183:52.21]spectator that would be that would be helpful um he's running in circles but I mean he can send it even with the cookie try he can't save us or we're in yeah there was what 15 objects we found one yeah one I found like like one or two more but uh by then it was too late I was just got a really really awful one I was stun locked in the in the ship I'm sorry I'm so stupid I was waiting for him to open the door and it's right
[184:30.01]Just walk past whatever was on the ground.
[184:33.06]Poke needs to find a solid gold bar or it's over.
[184:35.96]Yeah.
[184:40.46]Hair dryer.
[184:44.97]It actually works.
[184:45.69]That'll save us.
[184:59.45]You should see Ster's perspective of you getting Pac-Man-ed.
[185:02.85]Oh yeah, I should.
[185:06.17]At the end, when I'm done.
[185:07.07]So how long are you guys planning on playing for?
[185:09.85]Just out of curiosity.
[185:11.25]I have to go to the spider bed.
[185:22.13]He's gonna give him curls.
[185:26.28]Oh god.
[185:28.19]I mean I didn't hear him but it's okay.
[185:30.65]He's got us.
[185:36.72]Oh my god.
[185:37.70]Do we get an air dryer?
[185:48.15]Now he just needs to make it back at this time.
[185:50.75]Yeah with a thousand of those huge things.
[185:55.21]It's Jover.
[186:06.99]What's a hair dryer worth?
[186:08.11]Five bucks?
[186:11.48]At least five bucks.
[186:21.40]Oh dear.
[186:24.44]What the fuck?
[186:25.78]What just happened?
[186:27.58]What?
[186:28.40]God damn it!
[186:30.98]Did you get hit by a grenade?
[186:33.08]I don't even know.
[186:38.28]oh that's why the hair dryer would have saved us yeah that was it man what what happened what happened to you guys I got a spider yeah I went through hell man dude when you're alone it's just so scary it is so horrifying it's a different game it's a different game it's just damn it
[187:07.26]so so what's the plan fellas we run it back and we go again and we beat this what's the quickest way to reset what do we do here I gotta watch this one more time I'm sorry alright um I'll do one more then with you guys can I um get that link in chat of Ster's perspective again
[187:32.41]uh launched and equipped and then you should be close to the exit that actually would be faster if you guys are done though we have to play again though I don't care oh yeah yeah but I'll I'll do one more with you guys like right now and then you know as then when we all fail I'll just go and leave okay quit and uh join off me
[188:01.76]Oh, we're restarting?
[188:02.59]Okay.
[188:07.79]Oh my goodness gracious.
[188:14.18]Alright, so we're rejoining?
[188:15.06]Yep.
[188:19.60]I'm curious about Ster's perspective too.
[188:22.67]Probably still funny.
[188:28.47]Alright, so is he going to invite or just join off?
[188:33.41]Can you just join off people in this game?
[188:37.09]Maybe?
[188:40.76]Every POV is funny there?
[188:41.96]Yeah.
[188:42.24]I haven't even peed.
[188:51.44]You should be able to join off friends.
[188:52.70]Let me try.
[188:57.78]Does he have it open?
[188:58.42]I don't even see Ster on my list of people playing.
[189:29.74]Ster's in the lobby.
[189:30.50]How come it says he's not even in a game?
[189:31.50]Alright, tell Ster to invite me because I don't see him even playing a game.
[189:41.38]While I go pee.
[189:48.72]He's online, it just doesn't say he's in a game.
[189:52.02]Oh wait, hold on.
[189:52.63]Maybe that works now.
[189:55.15]Oh, maybe that'll work.
[189:57.17]Huh?
[189:58.03]Did it work?
[189:59.67]I think so.
[190:02.67]So I went into the server browser and I saw someone's server.
[190:06.13]It was called Sterority.
[190:07.39]I thought you were making a joke about like your name being long and it was not you.
[190:14.21]Yo.
[190:15.23]Hey.
[190:15.62]Yeah, no, it's friends only.
[190:19.90]Okay.
[190:20.64]Dude, I'm P-less today.
[190:22.18]Isn't that weird?
[190:23.38]On my first time playing this, I made it to like the fifth quota.
[190:26.99]I need us to step it up.
[190:28.55]Oh my god.
[190:29.49]Yeah.
[190:31.81]Listen, I really, really, really want to go to the other planets.
[190:39.79]That's how I dealt with my depression, guys.
[190:42.49]Thanks.
[190:44.39]That's one way to do it.
[190:45.41]Why are we landing?
[190:46.09]Oh, I just landed us?
[190:49.40]Hey, let's go.
[190:51.09]Okay, let's go.

[190:54.01]Where are we going?
[190:57.10]We're picking up stuff.
[190:57.92]We're gonna get at least a thousand dollars.
[191:00.50]Bugs.
[191:01.52]Bugs.
[191:02.34]Fucking not already.
[191:04.88]That didn't take long.
[191:05.98]Do you know how much beehives are worth?
[191:08.28]Like 150 for some shit?
[191:10.08]That's a lot.
[191:10.68]Yeah.
[191:11.48]That's like our full quota, man.
[191:13.08]Do you want to just get the beehive and close the door and just leave?
[191:17.94]Yeah, and then we could just go to the next thing.
[191:19.56]It'd be amazing.
[191:20.46]Grab quick.
[191:23.10]Got this.
[191:24.32]Okay.

[193:03.61]I already took damage.
[193:04.43]I shouldn't do it.
[193:13.69]So we go one more planet and get more money and then we go to the crazy planet.
[193:16.13]What do you think about that, sir?
[193:21.09]I mean, we can just we can do that.

[193:39.58]Well, wait, wait, hold... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[193:41.82]We need to deposit stuff.
[193:42.78]It's only 12.
[193:43.10]We need to both... We need to be able to be full sprinting.
[193:48.54]I'll close the door when you get in.
[193:53.10]Okay, so somebody aggro and somebody grab?
[193:54.72]Or do you want to... How does this want to work?
[193:56.36]Um, well, the aggro has taken place.
[193:59.45]Um, oh god.
[194:01.58]Grab this stuff.
[194:02.20]Someone grab this stuff now.
[194:03.44]Alright, I got it.
[194:04.84]Alright, Polk.
[194:05.42]Are you... Okay, Polk.
[194:06.66]Grab aggro.
[194:11.36]I got it!
[194:13.16]Run!
[194:13.24]Run!
[194:13.42]It's going fast!
[194:17.77]Get up!
[194:18.05]Run more!
[194:19.93]No, no, no!
[194:21.97]Can we go?
[194:22.77]Drop it!
[194:25.27]No, I'm gonna die!
[194:26.35]Open the door!
[194:27.47]Polk!
[194:27.77]I'm going to the ship!
[194:28.77]I'm gonna die!
[194:29.19]No, open the door!
[194:29.96]We need him!
[194:33.46]Oh shit!
[194:35.92]I was pressing close door!
[194:46.06]Probably worth it.
[194:54.35]That 256, that was enough to beat the other one.
[194:56.77]Hey guys!
[194:58.27]I'm sorry, Polk.
[194:59.61]How did that feel?
[195:00.45]I was pressing close door, not open door.
[195:03.25]I'm a fucking idiot.
[195:05.93]That did not kill me.
[195:08.11]Do you want to go just turn this in or do another mission?
[195:10.67]We turn it in at zero days, get the max profitus.
[195:14.79]This is a scream game.
[195:15.82]This is a huge scream game.
[195:18.72]Lots of good screams, too.
[195:20.72]I said we get more money.
[195:23.44]Go for it.
[195:25.42]As long as...
[195:28.24]not all of us die we have the duffy confirmed so like one person needs to play it safe and like watch the monitor and just leave if everyone else dies uh the duffy the duffel bag it's a kid's thing ew sorry about that that's a good noise
[195:55.03]People saying go to a tier 3 moon, there's new monsters.
[195:57.61]If we all die and it's inside the shelf... Nevermind.
[196:02.07]Guys!
[196:03.94]What just happened?
[196:05.26]He jumped.
[196:06.18]Oh, he jumped.
[196:08.50]Did he just die?
[196:09.28]He jumped off.
[196:10.36]I think so.
[196:11.56]Yeah.
[196:13.54]I'm almost dead.
[196:15.04]So I'm just gonna stay back at the ship.
[196:17.06]Okay, that's a good call.
[196:18.76]I'll open doors and things.
[196:21.04]Well, we can't tell you the door codes.
[196:23.32]We don't have walkies.
[196:25.35]Maybe we can get walkies.
[196:27.39]Just open them randomly.
[196:28.85]Just go over there and just open them.
[196:31.71]Just start typing like D6, C5.
[196:34.53]Just go crazy.
[196:35.59]Yeah, how many can there possibly be?
[196:37.55]I'm getting two walkie-talkies.
[196:41.29]Oh, then I'll wait for one.
[196:42.85]Okay.
[196:44.59]You can see the door codes on the map.
[196:46.23]Oh, people are saying do a spin in front of the door if you want them to open it.
[196:50.70]Oh, you can see it.
[196:52.20]You can see the door codes on the map.
[196:55.96]He's still on the way.
[197:06.55]I think I can see one at the.
[197:10.71]Here we go. 2.
[197:21.93]Alright, let's move.
[197:23.73]I'm the last person to ask.
[197:47.17]New creature data.
[197:49.29]Did Poke scan a creature?
[197:52.13]I think I just did by accident.
[197:59.20]I don't think it's this way.
[198:00.42]I don't know this map well.
[198:04.02]I'm just following you.
[198:06.32]Yeah, I know.
[198:11.91]Oh, here we are.
[198:13.02]I'm just here to cheer you on, right?
[198:15.16]I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
[198:19.06]I'm just here to say, like, hooray when you do things that are interesting.
[198:21.52]Okay.
[198:23.11]I'll try and do something interesting then.
[198:26.35]Hey, hey, let's go.
[198:27.19]We got a walkie set up.
[198:28.91]What's happening?
[198:30.95]You okay?
[198:31.41]It's so scary.
[198:33.07]Do you want to go down the fire exit?
[198:34.89]Yeah, I think it's safer.
[198:36.09]The bad guy is right in the front, man.
[198:42.08]This is a really scary idea.
[198:43.74]Okay.
[198:52.08]Listen, he might be here, though.
[198:54.59]Oh, the key right there.
[198:55.55]I got a key.
[198:56.65]I got a key.
[199:02.81]It's kind of dark, so we don't have a flashlight if you have any directions.
[199:06.21]Over.
[199:15.24]Oh yeah, right here.
[199:17.42]Nice.
[199:17.86]We got another key.
[199:19.31]Key.
[199:22.99]Anything else?
[199:28.07]Uh, where from whatever?
[199:29.55]Where do I go?
[199:30.07]Oh my God.
[199:44.41]Wait, wait, where?
[199:46.67]This is R2.
[199:47.67]It should show on the monitor.
[199:52.08]Nice.
[199:55.20]Yeah, good job.
[200:05.01]We got a generator.
[200:05.71]Let's take this and get out of here.
[200:07.73]Yeah, good money in here, guys.
[200:08.91]Big axle, too.
[200:09.71]Should we take this as well?
[200:13.21]Alright, let's do it.
[200:13.97]My hands are going to be full trying to walk us out.
[200:23.68]We all got something, right?
[200:32.94]Yep.
[200:33.38]I think I looked at him.
[200:35.60]It's the blob guy too.
[200:39.24]The blob.
[200:46.76]Oh, oh, oh.
[200:50.05]He said left.
[200:51.69]Oh, this is bad.
[200:52.89]I'm just running.
[200:59.63]I don't know where I'm going.
[201:00.65]Uh-oh.
[201:03.79]We need directions from here.
[201:04.85]There was a spooky thing, so we ran too far.
[201:08.48]Guys?
[201:11.54]Something's sniffing over there.
[201:27.42]we're going back oh wait we don't split don't spread out where are we going what is happening what is going on
[201:48.39]Can you call Vinny and say, Vinny, where are we going?
[201:51.91]Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, sir.
[201:54.70]Eyes.
[201:55.40]Okay.
[201:56.56]Okay.
[202:01.12]Okay.
[202:01.78]God damn it.
[202:02.50]God damn it.
[202:03.12]Good.
[202:06.96]You probably want to run like right now.
[202:12.04]Not that.
[202:12.78]Okay.
[202:13.86]Straight ahead.
[202:14.28]Straight ahead.
[202:14.68]Straight ahead.
[202:17.71]That is the right way.
[202:19.83]We have to stare at him.
[202:21.59]Oh, I thought we were not supposed to look at him.
[202:24.79]Yeah, I'm confused.
[202:27.78]We went and that was the right way.
[202:29.06]That's where I was trying to get them.
[202:30.28]That's so funny.
[202:31.08]We literally walked was literally where I was trying to get them the whole time.
[202:33.62]I feel like we went in four directions and it was in the directions because I have four compute blocked ways, right?
[202:39.78]Oh God.
[202:41.24]He's an aggro.
[202:53.70]Oh, smart.
[202:54.34]Okay, good.
[202:54.98]He's good.
[202:57.26]Give directions like a clock face.
[202:59.88]Oh, that's tough.
[203:00.90]Look at him, but not for too long.
[203:02.20]Oh, God.
[203:05.60]What's too long?
[203:06.38]Two seconds?
[203:07.30]Three seconds?
[203:08.04]Sir, I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm hearing strange noises around the ship.
[203:18.01]scan the creatures and yeah, I keep forgetting to scan stuff.
[203:20.51]I just get so scared that I just turn around and run.
[203:26.57]Hey.
[203:27.93]I don't mean to alarm you, but when you said good job, everyone around me was dead in like corpse piles.
[203:34.14]I know you don't have to talk in the mic.
[203:36.50]I'm right here.
[203:38.76]Correct over.
[203:43.92]Roger that.
[203:44.32]Are we going to leave then?
[203:46.78]I think it's time to leave.
[203:51.28]Sorry for my shit directions.
[203:52.88]Um, I think we should do clock.
[203:54.38]Someone recommended, like, clock.
[203:57.16]Yeah, we had no, um, no flashlight, so we were basically just... That was so funny.
[204:03.65]Yeah.
[204:05.01]Yeah, I mean, it was really, really hard, because every time you would turn, it would be like, oh, no, wait, go right.
[204:09.81]No, no, no, go turn right.
[204:10.73]It was just impossible.
[204:12.25]So, um, the best way to do it is to go in a direction and stay still, and then I could say, well...
[204:18.66]I tried to but then we see the the two white eyes in the hallway so like we had to sprint in a random direction I think everything else it felt like you were giving good directions it's just when we had to run from the slender man go right no no go left uh down up stop stop okay cool hi
[204:48.26]okay that you opened a lot of doors too for us though that was that was a good run it was you know I guess so we made it final day uh we've got we got some here 14. so uh just again make sure one person lives you got it I I opened one door stirothy yeah it helped a lot we would have been like totally dead-ended if you didn't
[205:19.92]Do you want to stay back again?
[205:21.61]We can do the same bit.
[205:23.49]I don't know if you need my terrible directions again.
[205:26.63]I think you're getting better.
[205:27.57]I think we're just running from the monster.
[205:32.39]Yeah, we should go one more time.
[205:35.09]Cherry tomato boys.
[205:36.09]Did you even read the instructional manual?
[205:47.36]It's up to you guys.
[205:48.00]Do you want me to do the directions again?
[205:50.32]Yeah.
[205:51.36]I'll do it one more time.
[205:52.72]It's worth it.
[205:53.50]We're trying hard.
[205:55.54]I may give clock directions.
[205:57.48]So like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[205:59.64]You know what I mean?
[206:02.44]So I may do that.
[206:05.04]If you have to say quarter circle forward, just do 2, 3, 6.
[206:08.48]2, 3, 6.
[206:09.56]What?
[206:11.98]I see what you mean.
[206:12.68]Okay, no.
[206:14.68]Good luck out there.
[206:17.20]Let's go.
[206:17.80]Let's do it.
[206:19.98]We just need some good stuff.
[206:21.10]I need to get rich.
[206:22.02]I need to get rich.
[206:30.93]Something in my eye.
[206:35.20]Can we get a haiku for some motivation?
[206:38.66]What is the haiku?

[208:32.95]No.
[208:33.65]Okay, because I dropped it right here.
[208:34.73]Okay, is there a locked door over there?
[208:40.26]Is that it?
[208:42.86]Any locks?
[208:44.80]Should we go to the side door?
[208:48.68]What's going on here?

[209:00.93]Okay, for the landmines.

[209:23.93]What's the Ster?
[209:24.51]What's the Ster?
[209:24.87]You gotta tell us what's going on, man.
[209:26.47]Ster or we don't... Oh, dear.
[209:32.20]Guys?
[209:32.84]What's up?
[209:34.08]Hey, I found a... Oh, turn, turn.
[209:37.58]Turn off the turret.
[209:39.62]Oh, shit.
[209:39.92]Something, a monster.
[209:40.44]A monster.
[209:41.06]There's a monster in there.
[209:42.10]Is there a monster in there?
[209:42.85]In that door.
[209:43.47]In the door?
[209:44.21]Oh.
[209:47.49]Oh, shit.
[209:48.19]Oh, shit.
[209:48.69]Well, can it open the door?
[209:50.57]I don't know.
[209:50.91]I don't know what it is.
[209:51.65]It's like a weird thing.
[209:55.13]Look at his face.
[209:56.35]Things are looking really bad here, Chief.
[209:58.66]Sturge is on the phone.
[209:59.76]He's not even talking to us.
[210:01.82]Dude, Sturge.
[210:03.18]I'm stuck behind the turret.
[210:04.36]Okay, he turned off.
[210:06.28]How?
[210:08.58]That turret is on.
[210:09.72]Okay, guys.
[210:12.24]Let's just get back to the base.
[210:13.80]Yeah?
[210:15.12]What the heck?
[210:16.72]He's turning it off.
[210:18.78]On a cooldown.
[210:20.30]Oh, it's on.
[210:20.84]It's on.
[210:21.10]It's on.
[210:21.44]It's on.
[210:21.74]It's on.
[210:22.60]This fucking mine's everywhere.
[210:26.79]Let's go.
[210:27.33]Watch out for the spider.
[210:29.01]It's coming, it's coming, it's coming.
[210:32.15]It might walk into one of those mines.
[210:33.85]Watch out for the mines.
[210:34.73]Holy shit.
[210:39.64]We're a little stuck here, boss.
[210:43.84]Nothing you can do to help us.
[210:45.76]Okay, does anyone have a flashlight?
[210:48.52]No, I have a key.
[210:51.10]Okay, look.
[210:52.94]I'm gonna... You dare me to bring you to the bottom?
[210:57.36]You're talking about you want to try to drag it over there and make it run into a landmine?
[211:00.86]I think it will run over the mines.
[211:04.78]But we have to not run over the mines as well.
[211:07.28]It's going to be very panicky.
[211:34.63]Let me just distract it and then you guys run left.
[211:38.49]Okay.
[211:38.83]You ready?
[211:39.31]I'm gonna like run right in front of it.
[211:40.97]We gotta pick that- What the fuck?!
[211:43.69]Oh shit!
[211:44.59]Oh god!
[211:44.97]Oh god!
[211:46.04]Let's do it!
[211:46.82]Oh my god!
[211:47.24]Let's do it!
[211:49.32]This is dead end.
[211:51.60]Okay.
[211:57.70]I'm six.
[211:58.28]I think Poke is dead.
[212:02.40]Trying!
[212:08.24]How do we die every time?
[212:12.89]The scream.
[212:14.69]Oh, my God.
[212:18.17]Are you dead?
[212:19.79]Sir?
[212:24.13]I'm still alive.
[212:24.97]I have something.
[212:25.95]It's going to be hard to talk with my hands full.
[212:27.61]I'm surprised we didn't run into a landmine, honestly.
[212:30.13]Okay.
[212:30.77]So basically, I believe, yes, Jerma and Polk are dead.
[212:35.49]Yes.
[212:35.95]Tom and Jerry scream.
[212:38.41]Okay, go straight, go straight, keep going straight.
[212:42.98]Wanna make a right?
[212:44.48]I'm shocked that we didn't run into a... No mines, nothing?
[212:47.92]Careful of the turret.
[212:49.66]You might not even run into the turret.
[212:50.91]Okay, unfortunately, the path you need to go to return is blocked by a red dot.
[212:56.29]So... Yeah.
[213:01.52]Yeah, which way is it?
[213:02.58]Left or right?
[213:04.11]Uh, it's to the right.
[213:05.45]Sorry, it's to your left.
[213:06.67]It's to your left and down a hallway to your left.
[213:08.57]So you can probably just run very quickly.
[213:11.86]Straight ahead.
[213:12.52]Keep going straight.
[213:13.34]Run fast now.
[213:15.58]Make a right.
[213:21.24]Oh, Jesus.
[213:22.06]He jumped over it.
[213:24.44]That was... Oh, no.
[213:33.70]Oh, what is he doing?
[213:34.78]I don't know why.
[213:35.64]Make a left here.
[213:36.46]Make a left here.
[213:38.40]He's the body.
[213:39.08]He's the body.
[213:40.97]He's the body.
[214:02.08]Take him right here.
[214:05.54]He's still guiding him.
[214:09.57]That's... They left the treasure outside.
[214:23.65]Oh, I forgot about that.
[214:25.82]Oh man, that was ridiculous.
[214:28.16]I kind of forgot about that treasure.
[214:30.66]Sorry about that.
[214:32.83]Don't ever give me direction duty again, thanks.
[214:36.17]You still giving him directions.
[214:37.81]It's good directions, it's just the element of a spider chasing you while receiving directions.
[214:44.31]Let's just tell him enough for the quest.
[214:49.86]Yeah, we gotta go back.
[214:53.49]Oh, I see.
[214:53.97]Like, we're gonna, like... No, we have zero days, so we should go to the company.
[214:57.82]They were totally blocked by enemies.
[214:59.20]Yeah, that's the problem.
[215:01.18]I'm sure it's not the directions problem.
[215:03.48]The beehive only.
[215:05.50]Beehive only.
[215:06.73]I missed a turn because I jumped over a spider's head and kept running straight.
[215:09.93]You said, keep going straight, and I ran all the way to the end, and you were like, oh, you missed a turn.
[215:14.22]Yeah, there is a sharp left.
[215:16.70]You have to, like, kind of predict.
[215:18.28]Like, when you're doing the Pac-Man, you have to very, very clearly predict, like, where someone might have to go.
[215:23.76]There's a radar booster.
[215:24.66]I don't know what it does, but it might help to, like, see more around us.
[215:28.50]People want me on direction duty, but what you have to understand is you guys are dead in 30 seconds when you go in.
[215:34.18]We're not.
[215:35.48]You can do direction duty if you want.
[215:37.12]It's fun.
[215:38.12]I'll try.
[215:39.30]We got to land.
[215:40.05]I took us to the...
[215:45.24]the company right?
[215:46.34]yeah okay uh so we're selling just enough for quota and keeping the rest?
[215:57.36]yeah I think it's a good idea just beehive?
[216:03.44]yeah just beehive is enough 150 right?
[216:06.59]you fellas have fun what does that mean you leaving?
[216:11.95]no I'm just I'm just gonna chill
[216:15.68]Vinny, it was so funny when you were still giving directions.
[216:19.32]The spider was moving his dead body for at least 20 to 30 seconds and you were still trying to tell him where to go.
[216:25.96]It was so goddamn funny.
[216:30.75]At one point, I was monitoring you guys.
[216:32.65]I'm like, why aren't they moving?
[216:34.13]I disabled the turret like seven times in a row.
[216:37.39]I was just standing behind it.
[216:42.85]Me and Polk ran into a dead end and that was just it.
[216:46.54]This was a firing squad.
[216:48.36]We need to put something else in.
[216:49.34]That was only 130 value.
[216:50.78]I'm gonna go put bottles.
[216:53.08]But yeah, then I saw the spider had cocooned him and I thought it was quite irregular behavior.
[216:58.63]I was like, wait, why is he just spinning in place?
[217:16.25]You can type view monitor on the terminal so you can type in door codes as you watch them.
[217:21.02]Really?
[217:22.92]Let's see.
[217:25.66]This monitor is way clearer too than this one is.
[217:29.00]Yeah, come on.
[217:29.94]The contrast is better.
[217:40.48]What just happened?
[217:46.47]I don't know.
[217:48.53]That was kind of scary.
[217:49.93]Did Ster just get eaten?
[217:52.08]Ster?
[217:52.84]Wait, what?
[217:54.36]Ster?
[217:55.90]Ster?
[217:56.76]What the fuck happened to him?
[217:58.62]Ster?
[218:00.18]Ster?
[218:00.82]Well, he's dead.
[218:01.36]Let's just go.
[218:02.18]Yeah, he's dead.
[218:03.24]There's blood everywhere over here.
[218:05.13]There's blood everywhere.
[218:07.03]Do you have a walkie-talkie on you, Vinny?
[218:12.31]Oh, no.
[218:12.73]I put it back in the cabinet.
[218:14.97]We have one.
[218:15.53]So let's just buy one right now.
[218:16.67]So we have two.
[218:17.83]Okay.
[218:27.20]Shovels on the sail.
[218:28.62]Do we need one?
[218:30.88]Somebody should take one in there.
[218:31.84]I feel like just having something to defend yourself with is worth it.
[218:40.08]chat member you can post that link you made some chat member made like a quick edit of each angle into one video oh really that's cool probably just gonna be a rickroll oh no no okay no it's good it's the pac-man incident from every angle okay yeah that's cool alright I'm ready
[219:03.70]Alright, do we have two walkies?
[219:06.14]Just one walkie.
[219:06.82]There's another one I think, so we're good to go.
[219:09.54]I'll try giving directions in the terminal.
[219:11.70]So when I'm looking at the terminal, I type what like open C2 or C3 or is it just open space door number or do I have to type like open space door?
[219:22.18]You just type the door number.
[219:23.36]That's it.
[219:23.80]That's it.
[219:24.12]Okay.
[219:25.02]That's it.
[219:28.50]Wait, get back on the ship.
[219:31.05]Oh, scared me.
[219:32.07]Whoa, whoa, okay.
[219:34.51]Wait, did you buy something?
[219:36.09]No, no, no, no.
[219:36.99]We got it, right?
[219:37.61]You got the object that you bought?
[219:39.71]Yeah, the one, the thing, yes.
[219:41.41]Okay.
[219:43.04]This is like, this is like pigtails.
[219:49.02]Yeah, what happened to you?
[219:50.94]What happened to me?
[219:52.02]Yeah.
[219:53.38]I got eaten.
[219:54.98]Oh.
[219:56.99]That's cool.
[220:04.43]Alright, I will try to guide.
[220:05.89]I'm trying to guide you guys to green Doritos and away from red dots.
[220:13.02]No, you're not coming?
[220:14.62]I was going to be the guide.
[220:15.60]He's going to be the guy.
[220:17.50]Who's going to be the walkie-talkie recipient?
[220:19.69]I got it again.
[220:20.61]Good, good.
[220:21.07]Okay, good.
[220:21.89]I don't want to do that.
[220:23.09]Keep in mind, it does run out of batteries eventually.
[220:26.61]Can you charge it?
[220:29.14]I'm just saying that like if I stop responding and I'm running around, I might be out of batteries or a spider might be pulling my body.
[220:37.15]Did we pick a moon?
[220:38.89]Yeah, we're here in offense.
[220:41.21]Landing?
[220:42.65]Yep, let's do it.
[220:44.17]Oh, this is one of the harder ones?
[220:45.99]It's like fourth.
[220:48.86]I don't think I've been this far.
[220:49.76]I'm not sure.
[220:51.06]Oh god.
[220:53.27]Okay.
[220:53.39]That's what I'm saying.
[220:54.15]I think we should all go.
[220:55.35]No, keep Jerma here.
[220:56.85]Because we don't want to lose all this stuff.
[220:58.69]We already have 140 on board.
[221:01.17]You're right.
[221:02.09]You're right.
[221:02.93]Can I swap between people?
[221:04.04]Jerma, Jerma, are you a tech guy?
[221:05.70]Can you type view monitor?
[221:06.94]Yeah, I just did.
[221:08.22]Can I change perspective?
[221:09.28]How do I change perspective?
[221:12.02]I don't know.
[221:12.32]You ask your chat, maybe?
[221:14.42]um no but that would be going in uh we're raw dog oh yeah you guys didn't buy flashlights oh yeah do you guys get a one walkie talk I mean get off the monitor get off the monitor get off I'm off I'm off wait is the flashlight worth it if we just right click the spam you know uh I ordered four okay yeah that to me signals it's probably worth it I agree how do I get all this shit off the screen
[221:52.30]Yeah, I really should just buy the yellows.
[221:54.38]I'm conditioned because Shore 4 was such a boss.
[222:06.37]Okay.
[222:06.87]Oh, I'm ready.
[222:08.73]Well, you know what?
[222:09.27]Yeah, I'll put it back.
[222:10.37]Uh, if you have one, that's yours.
[222:14.96]Yeah, but you ordered four, right?
[222:16.92]Yeah, OK, I put another one back here.
[222:19.80]Alright, let's go guys.
[222:20.78]Does Polk have one?
[222:22.02]Oh shit.
[222:23.30]They're on the ship.
[222:23.92]If you don't have them, they might be one on the ground.
[222:25.90]I'm pretty sure both are on the ship though.
[222:28.84]OK, I got the walkie up.
[222:31.39]I'm ready to guide.
[222:33.61]Let's go for it.
[222:36.31]Mic check mic check over.
[222:38.73]I can hear you loud and clear.
[222:39.89]Don't waste battery.
[222:41.51]Don't be a fool.
[223:00.11]How do I... What are you guys up to?
[223:08.73]Uh, what are you up to?
[223:18.74]Sir, what are you up to?
[223:28.83]Okay, Sturt, can you hear me?
[223:30.21]Over?
[223:31.09]Uh, yes, over.
[223:33.21]Okay, so, uh, straight ahead there, you've got a couple of rooms, you've got some, uh, they've got a corridor here.
[223:40.76]To the left, there is, uh, a, what number, that's two, what is it, T2?
[223:49.38]Is it open?
[223:49.94]Oh, that's open.
[223:51.36]On your left, there's going to be two Doritos, there's going to be stuff in here, go check it out.
[223:54.51]Okay.
[223:56.63]Two Doritos, by the way.
[223:58.37]Right in front of you.
[223:58.85]There's stuff right in here.
[223:59.89]In this room.
[224:00.24]Uh, direct me back to the main entrance just in case.
[224:06.94]Okay, come out here and take a right.
[224:10.50]Straight ahead.
[224:10.96]You're going to take another right when you get to the end of here.
[224:13.46]Right here.
[224:15.82]And then straight through there.
[224:18.98]And then you're back in the main entrance.
[224:20.08]No, no, no.
[224:20.28]Turn around.
[224:20.52]Turn around.
[224:23.91]Take a left.
[224:25.53]You're back here now.
[224:27.81]Pretty damn good directions, I think.
[224:36.42]There is an enemy.
[224:37.32]Be careful coming in right now.
[224:38.62]He's where Poke and Vinny just came from.
[224:44.32]There's a small red dot.
[224:45.72]Be careful.
[224:47.44]I'm on it.
[224:59.97]I'm going to pick up the items.
[225:01.31]Actually, no, I'm not.
[225:02.07]I actually have no idea where it is.
[225:03.21]I'm going back in, Jerma.
[225:11.22]Okay.
[225:11.50]I got you.
[225:12.46]There's still a monster there.
[225:15.58]It's a bunker spider to my right.
[225:17.36]That is what that is.
[225:18.94]There's more than one.
[225:20.34]There's two things over there.
[225:22.90]It is sprinting at you right now.
[225:24.59]It is literally running.
[225:26.23]Straight ahead.
[225:26.57]Straight ahead.
[225:27.69]There's a monster straight ahead.
[225:29.13]Right straight ahead.
[225:29.61]There's a huge thing.
[225:30.33]I don't know what it is.
[225:33.01]Monster, can you hear me?
[225:36.68]Yeah, it's a noose.
[225:39.94]Okay.
[225:40.80]If you go right, there's something right on you, man.
[225:43.28]There's something on you right now.
[225:46.26]You okay?
[225:46.46]Okay.
[225:53.74]Are you good?
[225:54.44]You seem to be standing still.
[225:56.86]He's dead.
[226:02.58]Um, should I go?
[226:05.60]Should I go to try to find Vinny and them?
[226:07.80]Ster's dead.
[226:24.38]I don't know if you can hear me, but Ster is dead.
[226:25.84]Ster died.
[226:31.04]Ster died!
[226:31.76]That's a bad idea.
[226:46.15]They're coming back, so I'll be fine.
[226:50.27]Yeah, they're coming back.
[227:03.29]What happened to Poke?
[227:08.57]They're very separated.
[227:09.49]Why are they so separated?
[227:17.70]What just opened the fucking door?
[227:22.06]What just opened the door?
[227:22.70]What just opened the door?
[227:39.47]Oh, it auto-opens.
[227:40.43]Oh, okay.
[227:49.18]You guys alright?
[227:50.92]What's go- What's going on?
[227:58.90]What is going on?

[228:07.58]Guys?
[228:10.43]What is making a... What are you guys doing?
[228:20.93]What the fuck are you doing?
[228:23.15]I was like, what is happening?
[228:28.39]That was horrifying.
[228:29.51]Are you making that noise?
[228:32.97]That is a Jerm, it's a robot.
[228:35.17]Yeah.
[228:37.25]Let's just shut up, shut up.
[228:40.22]oh my god how do I make it work I don't know it normally just wait why did it stop yeah why did it stop uh Ster's dead Ster died Ster died very early he ran he's coming to us wait
[229:13.70]Jesus.
[229:15.50]Esther is dead.
[229:16.22]He died.
[229:16.52]He's been dead for a long time.
[229:20.10]Within, I want to say 60 seconds, he was dead.
[229:24.60]Alright, I guess we're leaving.
[229:36.77]Yeah, I lost communication with he walked in a room and it was a big but slime thing.
[229:47.92]He died by a cockroach?
[229:51.44]Sir, did you die from a little cockroach?
[229:54.86]I have absolutely no idea who killed me.
[229:56.86]I had text-to-speech going and I alt-tabbed it and it instantly died, but something spurred it at me.
[230:01.18]I didn't see.
[230:02.04]Yeah, something ran at you.
[230:03.54]I was trying to scream it to you, but... Yeah.
[230:13.99]We had to go to March.
[230:22.72]Flower man or coil head?
[230:25.52]Sell stuff?
[230:27.12]I read that it's self suck.
[230:29.61]I mean, hey, I had that.
[230:36.49]Should we sell stuff?
[230:38.91]Oh wait, we're on another planet.
[230:40.13]It's less money if we do it now.
[230:41.47]It's like 50%.
[230:43.25]Uh, is there only one walkie talkie?
[230:45.23]I don't think we can do the guiding anymore.
[230:48.27]We can order another one.
[230:50.03]I say we just all go.
[230:51.01]Yeah, let's all go.
[230:53.54]I'm taking a flashlight.
[230:54.38]Alright, grab a flashlight and we will do this.
[230:58.00]Let's go for it.
[230:59.32]OK, but if you think things are going South, someone needs to survive.
[231:03.50]OK.
[231:06.60]Straight to the right.
[231:09.94]Yeah, no, I got it.
[231:10.70]I won't make that mistake again.
[231:22.97]Lethal Company.
[231:23.65]Does anyone have a walkie-talkie?
[231:24.93]What about a good bit?
[231:26.37]No, we left it in there.
[231:28.39]Don't feel bad.
[231:29.75]I brought it for some reason.
[231:30.55]I'm gonna leave it right here.
[231:38.44]It's okay, you can use the walkie-talkie for electromagnetic voice phenomena.
[231:42.56]Which you can talk to ghosts.
[231:46.36]Oh, fire exit is right here.
[231:48.30]Nice.
[231:50.62]what the hell oh my god I thought it was a I thought it was a whale or something I was I don't know this game makes all kinds of wacky ass noises
[232:19.33]You're going to get the horde is going to attack us.
[232:22.45]Sorry, sorry.
[232:23.85]Every spider in a 10 mile radius is going to be crawling up on him.
[232:31.16]Stop sign.
[232:38.90]Yes.
[232:41.26]Yes.
[232:43.00]Yes.
[232:46.14]Fucking love that bit.
[232:48.38]I did it.
[232:50.39]Yeah.
[232:53.49]Vinny, have you seen Saw 10?
[232:56.19]No, I'm not.
[232:57.02]Jeremiah, you're not going to believe this.
[232:58.22]I've never seen a single Saw movie.
[232:59.88]Oh, well, you have at least, you know, like a month's rate of viewing.
[233:05.12]Is it worth it?
[233:06.24]Oh, yeah.
[233:07.22]Well, okay.
[233:07.88]Hold on.
[233:08.50]1, 2, 3, 4.
[233:09.70]Yes, absolutely.
[233:10.86]A+.
[233:11.02]5, 6, 7.
[233:13.33]Not so much.
[233:14.01]The Saw 3D movie dog shit.
[233:17.47]Spiral?
[233:18.37]No.
[233:18.93]No, not at all.
[233:20.75]Saw 10?
[233:22.15]Brilliant.
[233:22.73]Beautiful.
[233:23.41]Unbelievable.
[233:25.35]Probably the best one in the whole franchise.
[233:28.44]Wow.
[233:32.16]What about the Saw game?
[233:34.10]That's a banger.
[233:38.28]5, 6, 7 is fine.
[233:39.54]It's just, you know, if you know, you know.
[233:41.50]I like 1, 2, 3, 10.
[233:43.77]Or, you know, who cares?
[233:47.47]Nobody knows what we're talking about.
[233:48.35]Okay, I'll let you know, Jeremiah.
[233:51.55]If I watch my first Saw movie, I will report back.
[233:54.85]The first one's definitely worth watching, for sure.
[233:56.41]If you've never seen it before.
[233:58.35]Okay.
[233:59.30]I remember when Saw was becoming a thing, there was also the movie Hostel.
[234:04.82]And that one I was forced to watch and I thought it was fine.
[234:08.13]It was just murder porn.
[234:10.43]I would say Saw is a 100 million times better movie than Hostile.
[234:15.15]Gotcha.
[234:16.47]Good to know.
[234:24.95]Big apple!
[234:26.31]Is that a screw?
[234:27.15]I found a screw.
[234:28.13]Nice.
[234:29.98]I'll take it.
[234:32.46]I have a can of soda.
[234:36.11]Wait, let me see that soda.
[234:37.21]Is that name red?
[234:38.53]No, it's just soda.
[234:39.83]Oh, it's soda.
[234:41.95]You don't call it pop, right?
[234:42.89]Did you grow up calling it pop or soda?
[234:44.81]Soda.
[234:46.23]Yeah, me too.
[234:47.17]Well, I guess Boston.
[234:48.41]Polk, where are you from originally?
[234:51.30]Canada.
[234:52.96]And you said soda up there, yeah?
[234:55.32]Yeah, soda.
[234:55.96]I think they say pop too.
[234:58.42]Okay.
[234:59.68]New York is pretty much exclusively soda.
[235:01.76]I think Boston's about the same too, yeah?
[235:05.29]Say Bepsy.
[235:07.11]Bepsy.
[235:08.27]Some people say, um, pop, or they just call every soda a Coke.
[235:12.68]I was gonna say that, yeah.
[235:14.44]Some places just call everything a Coke, even if it's a Sprite.
[235:17.83]Oh, look, guys.
[235:21.01]You giving this to me?
[235:21.99]Oh, we have two of these.
[235:22.71]I have two.
[235:25.39]Nintendo actually put out a statement in the, like, late 80s saying, dear parents and everybody, just so you know, not every gaming console is a Nintendo.
[235:35.44]Because people were, like, using it the same way they use Kleenex and Dumpster.
[235:41.40]Try to, like, just call everything Nintendo.
[235:44.67]We have a lot of stuff.
[235:48.79]Yes.
[235:50.23]Is Ster okay?
[235:51.29]We should probably return.
[235:53.77]Is Ster going to be alright?
[235:56.61]there's probably like next planet already yes dumpster is a brand chat it's not actually like now what about people that say Super Mario
[236:12.78]I grew up saying it Mario because as in New York here, I know Mario's and they pronounce it as Mario.
[236:22.07]And then I started saying that on the internet and people were like, this wrong is Mario.
[236:27.41]So now I say Mario because I'm ashamed into it.
[236:31.42]Yeah, say Mario.
[236:33.96]Well, I mean, he does go, it's a me.
[236:36.96]And he does not say Mario.
[236:40.34]Wait, how do we get home?
[236:44.66]Guys?
[236:46.72]I don't know.
[236:47.92]Is this the wrong way?
[236:49.80]Probably.
[236:52.28]We have about an hour and a half in-game and we can probably make it, I think.
[236:57.18]Try.
[236:57.45]This looks correct.
[237:13.68]It's like a big crater.
[237:15.82]I remember the crater.
[237:24.02]Yeah, you can fall on this thing and it's scary.
[237:29.48]You just die.
[237:32.18]You just freaking die.
[237:38.61]Oh, what's up?
[237:40.39]You alright?
[237:41.43]This way, this way.
[237:41.83]Follow my voice.
[237:42.45]Follow my voice.
[237:42.77]Oh, nice!
[237:43.09]What's going on?
[237:43.49]You alright?
[237:47.51]What's... Oh, okay.
[237:50.85]Sir?
[237:56.47]Aren't all the Jurassic Park dinosaurs different horns?
[238:00.52]Oh, the Jurassic Park dinosaurs?
[238:02.54]Isn't the T-Rex a horn?
[238:03.42]Not like the dinosaurs.
[238:04.34]Not like... They're the ones from Jurassic Park.
[238:06.72]Yes, the movie Jurassic Park.
[238:08.64]The T-Rex is a horn.
[238:14.48]The T-Rex in Jurassic Park was made with various horns and effects and elephants.
[238:19.99]Are we leaving?
[238:20.97]Oh, you mean the sound, right?
[238:23.83]Yeah, the sound effect.
[238:24.69]Slow down the sound of some animals.
[238:26.65]Combine them at a horn.
[238:28.17]I gotcha, I gotcha.
[238:30.54]Yeah, good job, guys.
[238:31.54]We did it.
[238:31.86]Look at this.
[238:32.16]Look at all this stuff.
[238:33.12]Did you know that the seagulls in Wind Waker were actually like elephant noises sped up or something like that?
[238:38.30]They're not actual seagull noises.
[238:39.72]It's weird.
[238:40.20]Could have just recorded a seagull.
[238:45.05]That is weird.
[238:47.07]We said you made that up.
[238:50.19]No, I think I think it's real.
[238:51.63]No, no, this thing I made up the fact that it's horns.
[238:58.62]You made that up.
[238:59.46]We have to go to offense.
[239:01.88]Are we going to the scary one?
[239:04.48]Are we going to order some flashlights or a talkie?
[239:10.46]OK.
[239:14.70]Some of them are dogs.
[239:20.17]And some pro flashlights.
[239:26.07]About two flashlights.
[239:27.53]We have 18 bucks.
[239:30.18]One walkie talkie.
[239:34.32]Fortnite after this?
[239:35.22]Nah, it's not Fortnite Friday, sorry.
[239:38.53]Oh, come on.
[239:39.55]Did you bring that one walkie talkie?
[239:40.51]Why does he play it every Friday?
[239:41.99]I have one walkie.
[239:43.22]I play it every Friday.
[239:44.16]I play Fortnite every single Friday.
[239:46.58]Do you want to do a Starcraft 2 ladder climb with me to Grandmaster?
[239:51.19]I'll play one custom game with you.
[239:54.15]How do you say no in every single language?
[240:00.48]How about this, how about this, Ster?
[240:02.72]Let's do what I did back in the day.
[240:04.44]We'll do a custom where we do, um, we, we fight against bots and then we betray our human allies.
[240:13.52]I don't, I don't want to play Starcraft.
[240:17.24]I was just trying to pick like the number one thing Jerma would say no to, but also I don't, I don't want to.
[240:22.39]Jerma, have you, you're not into any real time strategy?
[240:25.74]Uh, Command and Conquer Red Alert was my absolute jam because it's just, you know... Yuri's Revenge?
[240:33.04]No, that's a good one.
[240:34.16]No, that was good, but... No, no, I played Yaoi.
[240:37.14]Yaoi's Revenge.
[240:37.96]What the fuck did you just say?
[240:39.80]What the fuck?
[240:47.12]I was hoping it was going to kill him.
[240:49.44]Don't see what we're worth.
[240:57.44]Hey guys, here's a walkie-talkie.
[241:00.30]Somebody get this walkie-talkus.
[241:01.54]Wait, I think there's a flashlight missing.
[241:05.16]Actually, no.
[241:06.06]I have a flashlight if someone needs one.
[241:08.00]Uh, I gotta charge mine.
[241:10.96]You guys better, you're burning daylight.
[241:17.79]Uh, but I played Red Alert, the original, because it was really fun to just build power plants and then build Tesla coils across the map into the other person's base.
[241:27.61]Oh, then you zap them in Yowie's Revenge.
[241:30.01]If you... If you know, you know.
[241:34.38]Who's gonna... I'll be on the monitor.
[241:35.80]Because I took a fucking stop sign to the head office.
[241:39.78]That's true, you did.
[241:40.66]Yeah, okay.
[241:41.12]Here, take this then.
[241:41.84]Take this.
[241:43.63]Do you have a... Do you have a... Okay.
[241:45.19]I got one.
[241:47.13]Here, sir.
[241:47.57]Take that.
[241:49.91]Vinny, you good?
[241:52.35]Vinny, bees!
[241:55.93]Alright, we're good.
[241:56.51]Let's go.
[241:57.23]Are we good?
[241:58.27]This way.
[242:01.36]Alright, where are we going?
[242:03.26]Oh.
[242:04.34]You good?
[242:05.84]I'm good, dog.
[242:06.76]What the fuck?
[242:07.20]You just teleported to me.
[242:09.14]No, no, no, dog.
[242:10.12]I'm just chilling.
[242:12.10]Also, the Tanya strat was unbelievable in Red Alert.
[242:15.80]You just made a bunch of Tanyas and just sent them in and just blew up everything.
[242:20.43]I... God.
[242:22.27]Yeah.
[242:22.67]I fucking... The original Command and Conquer...
[242:25.98]Red Alert.
[242:26.34]I never played Red Alert 2.
[242:28.88]But there's Tim Curry in that one.
[242:30.66]And he's, you know, he says the meme.
[242:32.92]Yeah.
[242:33.16]Oh, that's right.
[242:33.68]There was all the live action FMV stuff.
[242:36.31]Yeah.
[242:36.83]Yeah.
[242:37.03]The original Command & Conquer and Red Alert are two great games.
[242:40.15]Still, they hold up.
[242:49.24]That's Red Alert 3?
[242:49.82]Oh.
[242:54.04]Here, Vinny.
[242:55.18]Oh, you have one, okay.
[242:56.50]Where's Ster?
[242:57.14]We dumped Ster.
[242:58.80]Hey, were you talking?
[243:01.73]We had you off the whole time.
[243:02.95]Hey, what's up?
[243:07.27]Yeah, okay, got you now.
[243:08.93]Oh yeah, there's already a monster.
[243:18.43]Okay.
[243:21.81]Fight.
[243:18.81]Fight!
[243:31.81]Is he gonna scan?
[243:38.81]Is it just a little shit? I'll get it.
[243:45.81]There's another one!
[243:55.93]Did I get it?
[243:56.41]Are you live?
[244:02.37]Oh, the disappointment in your voice was so good.
[244:10.49]Wait, wait.
[244:11.15]Oh, there's already two monsters.
[244:13.54]Oh, shit.
[244:15.20]Look for a short while.
[244:15.94]I just looked for a short while.
[244:18.22]Okay.
[244:18.36]Oh, my God.
[244:25.64]Polk, Polk, are you in here?
[244:27.70]Polk?
[244:29.32]Polk?
[244:30.46]Oh, Polk?
[244:31.82]Polk?
[244:33.66]Oh, I'm the only one.
[244:37.32]You're alive.
[244:42.53]No, I'm here.
[244:42.95]I'm here.
[244:43.15]I'm good.
[244:43.35]I'm good.
[244:46.31]Yeah.
[244:46.69]No.
[244:47.13]Shit.
[244:54.97]Okay, so it killed Vinny.
[244:56.73]We didn't scan it.
[244:58.35]But we're going to try scanning it.
[244:59.97]Okay, I'll scan it.
[245:01.45]Where is it?
[245:09.00]Hey, maybe you shouldn't go.
[245:11.12]You don't think so?
[245:12.62]Which way did it go?
[245:14.50]It killed Vinny here and then I ran away.
[245:18.00]Scan it.
[245:18.39]Scan it.
[245:18.69]I'm going to scan it.
[245:25.17]Where is it?
[245:25.51]It just went this way.
[245:33.27]Where is it?
[245:33.75]It has to be this way.
[245:38.53]Do you have the walkie talkie?
[245:43.69]Yeah.
[245:43.85]Do you see any rabbits or no?
[245:48.35]It's right there to the right.
[245:49.19]It's right there.
[245:51.30]Right to the right?
[245:52.38]You talk to him.
[245:53.20]You talk to him.
[245:55.53]Take the walkie-talkie.
[245:56.23]Okay, okay.
[245:56.67]Hey, bro.
[245:56.95]What's up?
[245:57.17]Where is it?
[245:57.41]Right in front of me.
[245:58.09]It is right in front of you.
[246:01.28]There's a red dot.
[246:01.70]It might be on the ceiling.
[246:05.92]It's one of those ticks.
[246:12.25]You're almost right on top of it.
[246:16.33]Oh!
[246:16.43]Got it!
[246:19.37]Come here, you little shit!
[246:20.33]Another one!
[246:26.26]Get over here!
[246:27.80]What the fuck is happening?
[246:30.04]What the?
[246:30.84]Oh, what?
[246:31.16]Scan it!
[246:39.79]Oh.
[246:41.07]Yeah.
[246:41.75]Did I get it scanned?
[246:43.97]I think it's scan- I think it was scanned.
[246:51.25]I just chased a fucking like cockroach around the house.
[246:54.43]What the hell am I doing?
[246:55.37]How many times did you hit that?
[246:56.47]It looked like you hit it like five times.
[246:58.19]I don't know.
[246:59.09]And it's gone.
[247:02.35]What the?
[247:02.69]This is looking like a bust.
[247:05.15]Um.
[247:07.87]Yeah, that's not good.
[247:09.31]That's probably not good.
[247:10.77]That's a huge, huge thing.
[247:16.25]Oh, it's down there.
[247:23.00]Hey, there's... Are you just coming back?
[247:28.13]Your little baby?
[247:31.71]Yeah, I got full loot, but there's the tree monsters out here, bro.
[247:34.05]Uh, okay.
[247:43.49]Yeah, I did... Hey!
[247:45.17]I chased that thing around, like, Tom and Jerry, like, with a frying pan.
[247:49.71]That was so stupid.
[247:50.15]That's not a good idea!
[247:56.08]uh you look clear nothing here I got one item I lied you ran into spike the dog okay well that's it then well I got these though it was looking like a dead end and you guys were just completely blocked by like three or four things you had to go that way alright it's okay one bad day
[248:25.24]Well, not that bad because we got something and we got money.
[248:28.57]We got an A. Grade A?
[248:49.90]That's pretty good.
[248:52.01]Oh, because it thinks we fucking got all this from that area.
[248:54.77]No, we didn't.
[248:57.31]Uh oh.
[248:59.19]We have to sell this stuff now, yeah?
[249:01.53]Yeah.
[249:06.54]Well, that was a higher level moon, right?
[249:10.50]Yeah.
[249:12.56]So I have to pee.
[249:14.92]I'll be right back.
[249:17.16]Okay.
[249:21.28]How do I mute myself in the game?
[249:51.83]okay well I'm just I'm just gonna be quiet alright well my mic's not gonna be muted whatever I'm peeing grab the horn rotate wildly while pressing it
[250:22.19]I don't hear anything different.
[250:23.89]You don't get the Doppler?
[250:26.77]No.
[250:27.69]It's that Unity thing.
[250:29.73]Yeah.
[250:32.03]Oh, I hear it when he did it.
[250:37.12]There's like a fucking 0.1 sense.
[250:41.28]Someone in my chat said that the horn is actually like a porn star moan.
[250:47.45]I don't believe it.
[250:48.09]I don't think it is.
[250:49.43]I don't think it is.
[250:52.34]You can't just blast your horn at the company.
[250:55.88]Oh, God.
[251:32.17]Wait, was that loud?
[251:33.01]I don't know.
[251:39.51]I'm not grabbing.
[251:40.39]Okay, I grabbed it.
[251:41.53]I think that's quota for us.
[251:45.57]Sorry about that.
[251:47.77]This is a horn type game.
[251:51.39]Do we have flashlights?
[251:56.06]He asked me to make loud noises to cover up his piss.
[252:00.08]I was gonna say it.
[252:06.74]Oh, we're a little bit off the teleporter.
[252:11.24]Oh, really?
[252:12.42]Yeah, we could sell, like, two more things.
[252:15.33]One more, maybe?
[252:16.55]One of my chat members said for us to go to, like, Endgame planets.
[252:19.85]Is this a terrible idea?
[252:21.87]We have to.
[252:23.49]Okay.
[252:26.28]Chat, I don't believe I will be streaming Mario RPG tonight.
[252:38.49]If I did, it would only be like an hour.
[252:40.27]We could do part two tomorrow or something like that.
[252:42.01]I can't tomorrow.
[252:44.86]Or whenever you're ready.
[252:48.34]It's Mario night.
[252:49.44]We can't not do Mario.
[252:50.64]No, it's okay.
[252:51.40]It's okay.
[252:51.84]Mario night can...
[252:57.55]We don't have to buy a teleporter.
[252:58.51]We can just get money.
[253:01.66]I think it's a good idea if we just make our goal right now.
[253:04.84]Get like 500 bucks.
[253:06.16]Or how much is it?
[253:06.86]Let me see.
[253:08.56]I fucking hate that company.
[253:12.45]$700.
[253:12.53]Or 500 bucks.
[253:15.41]And go to Endgame Planet and experience it.
[253:18.77]What do you think about that?
[253:19.83]I'm down for that.
[253:20.79]And I can do, instead of an hour of Mario night, I can do Mario night another night.
[253:25.55]Like, and do more Mario.
[253:26.83]I mean, we might be able to do it really fast right now if we get money and then go there next.
[253:34.34]Okay.
[253:35.62]I'll see.
[253:36.42]But yeah, I'm not, I have no problem with that.
[253:38.75]I'd rather do like a decent amount of Mario than only a little.
[254:06.48]Can Vinny not stream tomorrow or something?
[254:09.02]I have practice tomorrow, and I don't think me doing voices in a Mario game is going to be all that great for me.
[254:16.88]I think I might try to stream Wednesday.
[254:20.28]I remember there being a cooldown.
[254:23.84]Are we good?
[254:24.40]What's up?
[254:28.22]Do we have two walkies?
[254:31.30]We've got one.
[254:32.02]Unless someone else has one.
[254:34.28]We've got two.
[254:34.68]Uh-oh.
[254:37.26]Alright, then we're ready to go.
[254:41.96]Oh shit.
[254:42.40]Uh, we got the teleporter now.
[254:44.12]If you are stuck, you spin in circles, I can pull you back.
[254:48.23]What button did I press to mute?
[254:53.13]Is there a keyboard shortcut that muted?
[254:55.49]What the fuck did I do?
[254:59.69]I've been told we bought the wrong teleporter.
[255:03.40]I bought the inverse teleporter.
[255:04.85]That's the only teleporter I saw.
[255:07.25]What does this one do then?
[255:08.15]You can hear them.
[255:08.83]Yeah, what the fuck is happening?
[255:14.71]This is the one that puts you in the building.
[255:16.80]This is the one that puts you in the building.
[255:18.10]All my, like, audio.
[255:27.78]That teleports you to danger.
[255:29.28]No, no, like my windows has the X like muted.
[255:33.72]What's the keyboard?
[255:35.36]Unmute.
[255:35.78]Random spot inside.
[255:36.96]I sound like a fucking idiot.
[255:39.35]What did I press?
[255:41.31]Oh, well.
[255:44.01]M?
[255:44.47]Jerma.
[255:46.25]Jerma.
[255:51.35]Dude, okay.
[255:51.97]Now I can hear, I can hear, I can hear.
[255:57.49]That was really, I don't know, that was strange.
[256:01.77]OK, I am ready.
[256:05.32]OK, so I bought the wrong teleporter I want.
[256:08.90]Who who wants to go into a random location inside the base?
[256:13.80]I do.
[256:15.38]You take the walkie with you, whoever is going and we're going to blast you in.
[256:19.86]OK, where are we landing?
[256:21.02]Are we doing an end game planet?
[256:24.51]I heard there's some cool monsters.
[256:31.98]380.
[256:33.72]Let's do March and let's try out this teleporter.
[256:38.82]Okay.
[256:45.46]Jeez, that's a lot of people.
[256:46.70]Thanks for the rain, Snuffy.
[256:47.54]I'm back.
[256:49.17]Who has the walkie?
[256:53.13]Who has the walkie?
[256:54.82]What happened?
[256:55.98]I do not have the walkie.
[256:57.42]I think Jerma has it, but I don't know if Jerma's doing okay.
[257:00.20]No, no, I don't have it.
[257:01.18]I'll do the walkie.
[257:02.20]He went to the bathroom and took a fucking... I'm right here.
[257:06.14]Hey, only one of those things is true.
[257:15.81]I got this.
[257:17.13]I'll take the teleporter in.
[257:20.60]Charge your rechargeables, everyone.
[257:22.74]Get ready.
[257:23.16]Everybody charge.
[257:23.94]Yep, yep, yep.
[257:25.54]Alright, what are we picking up here?
[257:28.32]I want a big flashlight.
[257:29.60]I'm teleporting Vinny in.
[257:31.41]I'm going in, fellas.
[257:32.55]I'll see you later.
[257:33.63]Be aware you might be next to danger.
[257:36.29]I'm being told you can't take items.
[257:37.75]Am I muted?
[257:40.31]Really?
[257:40.75]Yeah, no, that makes sense.
[257:41.77]What the fuck is going on?
[257:43.19]I told you something weird was going on.
[257:45.47]Send me in alone then.
[257:47.85]Oh, okay.
[257:49.35]Let's go.
[257:51.15]No flashlight.
[257:53.37]Poke, you going?
[257:54.79]Yeah.
[258:00.59]I don't have a mic anymore in the game.
[258:02.89]OK, Jerma.
[258:09.08]Can you hear me right now?
[258:11.90]Yes, OK, for some reason I have no idea why it it like disabled my microphone in the game.
[258:18.74]There's a push to talk option and settings.
[258:20.51]Maybe press it like there's a cheese to talk.
[258:22.51]I don't know if you did something weird.
[258:23.65]They're already in the base.
[258:25.97]I'm trying to watch my boys.
[258:28.27]OK, should I go with him?
[258:30.57]You should go.
[258:31.21]Yeah, take a walkie or a flashlight walkies right here on the floor.
[258:34.93]Give me a walkie.
[258:40.75]Alright.
[258:43.03]What's the easiest way to get over there?
[258:44.35]OK.
[258:55.04]Over there, I think.
[258:57.66]I think I'm going the right way.
[258:58.62]Over.
[259:14.44]There's a beehive.
[259:21.84]Bleh bleh bleh bleh bleh bleh.
[259:31.55]Are you guys in here?
[259:41.68]You guys in here at all?
[259:46.33]Ster Ster they in here.
[259:50.61]Like.
[259:53.37]What do you mean?
[260:17.65]It's probably down.
[260:18.25]You're right on it.
[260:23.70]I got it.
[260:25.78]I got it.
[260:26.18]And there's something in this other room that you were going to go into next.
[260:32.24]Yeah.
[260:35.03]Alright, there's a big thing here.
[260:36.33]I'm going to come back.
[260:46.80]Hey, no, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me.
[260:48.56]You alright?
[260:51.47]Where are you?
[260:56.23]It's me, it's me, it's me, it's Jerma.
[261:00.81]Yeah, what's up?
[261:07.56]Yeah, they're yelling at me.
[261:09.86]Where are you guys?
[261:10.40]Up or down?
[261:10.98]We're at a fire exit right now.
[261:12.94]Wait, there's like... Hold on a second.
[261:14.46]There's more than one fire exit.
[261:16.12]He forgot his name.
[261:17.26]No, I don't know.
[261:19.74]Wait, there's more than one fire exit.
[261:22.14]Jerma, you might be like above us somewhere because we are at a fire exit.
[261:26.14]I must be.
[261:26.76]Let me ask Ster.
[261:31.12]Ster, where are they in regards to me?
[261:33.90]Jerma, here.
[261:35.14]Where?
[261:35.40]Up?
[261:35.52]You guys up?
[261:41.39]Hey, are you guys alright?
[261:49.68]I'm dumb above you guys for sure.
[261:50.86]OK, I'm just going to go back.
[261:56.88]Not talking to him.
[261:58.58]Alright, I'm heading back with stuff.
[262:23.49]Going the right way, right?
[262:29.65]Oh, shit.
[262:38.84]There we go.
[262:53.23]Okay, where the fuck is the ship?
[262:57.25]There it is.
[262:59.49]That's a rock.
[263:00.45]Uh-oh.
[263:02.35]Where's the ship?
[263:05.53]Am I going the right way?
[263:06.17]I actually don't know where I'm going.
[263:13.57]I think it's over here.
[263:14.31]I don't remember where it is.
[263:19.55]I literally don't know where I'm going.
[263:22.80]Everything's so misty.
[263:23.94]I can't see anything.
[263:25.18]I came from over there?
[263:41.37]There it is.
[263:45.10]Oh, fuck.
[263:45.84]Shh.
[263:46.28]Quiet.
[264:15.99]Okay.
[264:19.09]Alright, I made it back in.
[264:20.31]It took me way faster than you think.
[264:35.08]Are you, uh... You teleport back in there, right?
[264:37.44]Let me see if I can find you.
[264:44.82]Uh...
[264:50.66]Oh my- Get off the fucking computer!
[264:59.48]What the fuck?

[265:17.24]Alright, bye.
[265:28.58]Who just blew a referee whistle?
[265:30.66]What was that?
[265:31.18]Hi, everyone.
[265:41.98]Okay.
[265:43.40]So that was some of the scariest shit yet.
[265:48.93]Oh, man.
[265:51.73]Referee, I'm sorry.
[265:57.04]Where are we at on quota?
[265:58.62]We got to step up.
[266:03.62]Thank you for the follows, new chat members.
[266:05.60]I appreciate it.
[266:08.13]Also, this place is a mess.
[266:11.07]It is.
[266:13.13]But it's very profitable.
[266:15.17]Very profitable mess.
[266:17.09]Yeah.
[266:18.01]We already have a pretty decent collection of things.
[266:19.99]How did the teleporter go?
[266:23.42]Scary as fuck, but me and Poke did find each other, and then we found that there were two fire exits stacked on top of each other, and it was just confusing and scary, and we wasted so much time that we got sandwiched between a dog and a slender.
[266:36.34]Or a different enemy.
[266:39.09]I fucking hated it.
[266:41.09]What he said.
[266:41.93]Hey, you didn't ask me what I did.
[266:44.51]I saw a rock.
[266:48.27]You saw a rock?
[266:49.03]It was big, and I took a picture of it.
[266:53.53]oh also that map had two fire exits apparently three according to a chat member oh wow damn okay uh I'm gonna teleport in I don't know what okay Ster you brave soul I'm gonna drop this light hey I'll see you inside

[267:40.92]Flashlight.
[267:43.36]Should be just up here anyway, so.
[268:08.24]The colors are so nice in this game.
[268:10.82]Like this yellow.
[268:11.54]Yeah, everything looks really nice.
[268:14.40]Very pretty.
[268:24.15]It was a little jarring at first, but I kind of like it now.
[268:34.61]Alright.
[268:34.93]Alright.
[268:36.69]What are we working with?
[268:37.39]Um... Ster?

[270:04.59]Okay, get ready to run to my boys, okay?
[270:10.91]They're all the way down.
[270:11.63]Jeremiah, what happened to you?
[270:28.05]There's nowhere I can really go.
[270:29.39]I think it's a dead end.
[270:34.84]I can go in here.
[270:35.72]No, there's nothing here.
[270:36.40]Am I crazy?
[270:38.28]There's nothing here, right?
[270:39.94]No.
[270:46.14]What the fuck was that?

[271:19.22]Why jump off?!
[271:20.62]Oh my god!
[271:21.56]Why is your reaction to run forward and jump off?
[271:24.51]Did- Did you not see what it did to me?!
[271:27.91]I'm talking about Jerma!
[271:29.13]It- Dude, I- It- It fucking- I don't know what I- I don't know!
[271:33.59]I don't know where to go!
[271:34.47]All treasure gone.
[271:36.27]All of it.
[271:36.89]I don't even know what happened.
[271:37.89]That, like, teleported into my face.
[271:40.49]I didn't know it could do that.
[271:41.47]Okay.
[271:46.71]That's not great.
[271:48.21]I had no... Okay, but behind me, there's nowhere to go.
[271:50.31]I don't know what's wrong.
[271:52.87]It was all just terrible.
[271:54.03]That's what that was.
[271:54.65]It was just terrible.
[271:55.37]We have one day to get, like, what? 380...
[272:01.25]It was a dead end behind me.
[272:03.79]I got a lot of stuff, I just couldn't find my way out.
[272:05.95]I had three stop signs.
[272:09.70]It's this fucking teleport that is killing us.
[272:13.90]Someone in my chat said all four teleport for the final mission.
[272:17.08]Let's go.
[272:17.36]Alright, let's do it.
[272:18.34]Dude, okay.
[272:22.36]Behind me, it was a dead end.
[272:24.66]So I was just dead.
[272:26.56]After he killed you, he was going to kill me.
[272:27.72]I had to try to jump.
[272:28.40]I had to try to jump for something.
[272:31.45]Yeah, you think you're dead no matter what.
[272:33.65]That coilhead guy, you have to stare at him or otherwise he comes at you.
[272:37.49]Guys, this island has 1,458 worth of items.
[272:44.79]Okay, everybody in the teleporter.
[272:49.15]14 items.
[272:50.35]Get in here.
[272:51.92]What the fuck?

[273:51.84]There's nothing in there.
[273:54.68]Anybody hear me?
[274:06.41]I see light in there.
[274:07.17]I'm going up.
[274:22.47]Hello?
[274:22.79]I got nowhere to go.
[274:29.97]I have to go this way.
[274:31.15]Oh, thank God.
[274:42.86]Wait, was I already?
[274:43.42]No.
[274:53.19]Sir?
[275:00.61]Somebody... Somebody collected an item?
[275:07.36]Fuck.
[275:11.64]Oh god.
[275:13.00]Oh my god, I don't know where I am.
[275:23.44]What's happening?
[275:24.04]I'm stuck.
[275:28.14]I'm actually stuck.
[275:32.60]Um... Okay, um...
[275:57.72]I just can't see anything.
[276:04.32]Ah!
[276:07.90]Oh, god damn it.
[276:09.10]I'm like... I put my hand on the walls to even know where I... what direction I could even go.
[276:16.09]Are they back in the... are they back in the truck laughing at me?
[276:33.07]Person.
[276:33.67]Somebody.
[276:34.31]Where are you?
[276:38.63]I don't know.
[276:38.97]I don't know where I am either.
[276:40.09]There's a bunch of steam.
[276:41.07]Oh, that's.
[276:44.90]Hold on.
[276:45.16]Wait.
[276:45.38]I'm going to try to.
[276:45.82]Can you still hear me?
[276:50.54]Secure door.
[276:51.58]Can be access.
[276:52.26]Oh, it's a door.
[276:55.56]Can you still hear me?
[277:06.52]Where is it?
[277:06.92]Can I touch the valve?
[277:13.13]Can I turn it off?
[277:17.47]Oh, shit.
[277:17.89]I didn't know I could do that.
[277:21.57]I found a fire exit and a bunch of beer.
[277:23.89]You got... Bro, you got bruised?
[277:26.88]I got bruised and I found a fire exit.
[277:29.76]Bro.
[277:29.96]Alright, we're good.
[277:31.86]Okay, okay.
[277:33.22]We just need to get you, uh, go that way, and then up and across, and we'll bring the beer back.
[277:38.71]You got it.
[277:46.75]Holy shit.
[277:47.97]I almost just... I almost just walked off the edge, dude.
[277:53.69]Alright, I'm coming up.
[277:57.29]Okay.
[277:58.17]I'm coming.
[277:59.71]Yep.
[278:03.87]Uh, wait, where?
[278:05.84]I'm here, somewhere.
[278:07.48]I'm down the ladder.
[278:09.98]I just can't see.
[278:10.86]I'm terrified to even move.
[278:12.58]Oh, here, here, here.
[278:14.60]Is it?
[278:14.98]Okay.
[278:20.85]Okay.
[278:21.03]Everything's so dark.
[278:22.13]You know what?
[278:22.43]I look over at my preview on OBS.
[278:23.97]It's brighter over there.
[278:25.27]Why?
[278:25.51]I don't know.
[278:27.49]I don't know.
[278:29.31]I'm going to play with my OBS monitor.
[278:31.33]There's some beers right there.
[278:32.47]Beers.
[278:35.01]Yeah, let's get them.
[278:36.99]Alright, so we got those.
[278:38.11]There's the fire exit.
[278:39.92]I'm just going to take a quick look and see if there's anything else at end.
[278:45.38]There's also this room.
[278:55.03]Nothing.
[278:55.55]Alright, let's bring the bruise back.
[278:56.75]Yeah, let's at least have a little bit of a party, you know what I mean?
[279:01.75]I also put some brews over here, but I don't think we're going to be able to get those.
[279:05.55]I'm imagining they die.
[279:06.61]We've got one hour.
[279:10.07]Oh my God.
[279:10.87]I'm just laughing like it's tickling you.
[279:25.58]I know I'm laughing because Vinny crouched and he's fine.
[279:28.06]No, he's not.
[279:34.37]well that's that oh my god that was terrifying you know you know someone in my chat a while back told me to hide behind a tree when those enemies appeared it seemed like it was working but you gotta you kind of gotta run when it's eaten I was stuck in the steam room and just running in a circle panicking it was really really bad
[280:01.76]If you hit it with a shovel, it'll drop the person it's hitting.
[280:08.69]Well, it worked until you ran.
[280:11.07]Well, we're back.
[280:12.99]We're back to level one now.
[280:14.13]Is there anything that we keep permanently?
[280:16.94]Nope.
[280:18.14]These cool radios.
[280:19.00]Alright, so we reschedule to come back and beat this thing next time?
[280:28.24]No, this is fun.
[280:29.16]I definitely want to play again.
[280:30.22]We have to keep the teleporter.
[280:35.95]But yeah, this is great.
[280:36.81]I would love to play this again.
[280:39.57]And I think there is a mod for bigger lobbies, so we'll investigate that.
[280:45.32]And more suits.
[280:47.02]Yeah, and more suits too.
[280:48.44]And there's one with swimsuits.
[280:52.74]That's even better.
[280:54.24]Yeah, I mean, if you guys want to do a total fuckface run and just get 15 people in one game, I'm down to try it.
[281:02.16]I think Criken was saying like 8 people is still really good.
[281:06.24]So I'd be down for like a good 8 people lobby.
[281:07.95]So yeah, there's later levels we didn't get to that cost $600 to even travel to.
[281:13.33]Yeah, we need more people actually if you think about it at this point.
[281:16.79]It's true.
[281:17.23]That was, I mean, that was hilarious.
[281:20.92]I had a great time.
[281:22.74]That was unbelievable.
[281:24.00]This was one of my favorite streams I've done all year.
[281:26.36]Honestly, this is one of the best things I think I've done all year.
[281:29.44]Okay, then why are you leaving?
[281:32.18]Because it's been five hours.
[281:36.64]I got to do something in real life too, so yeah, actually it's a good point.
[281:39.24]It's a good time.
[281:41.34]It's great though.
[281:42.36]We'll play it again.
[281:44.53]I really want to play this again, so as soon as you guys are ready.
[281:47.87]Hell yeah.
[281:48.71]I have Thanksgiving things to do, but after Thanksgiving we can reconvene and I would love to play more.
[281:55.65]So thanks guys.
[281:56.69]This was great.
[281:57.48]Hey, I have an important question before you go.
[282:00.34]When is Thanksgiving?
[282:03.13]Thursday?
[282:04.60]Okay, that's helpful.
[282:08.28]Yeah, you gotta get those mashed potatoes, the stuffing.
[282:15.30]And yeah, play Pac-Man music while you're cooking.
[282:18.64]The Pac-Man thing, oh my god.
[282:21.90]Alright, guys.
[282:22.43]I can't wait to watch all those goddamn clips.
[282:24.11]Take it easy, guys.
[282:26.11]Take care.
[282:26.89]Bye.
[282:27.05]Bye.
[282:27.27]Bye.
[282:36.08]Oh, that was fun.
[282:37.21]That was really fun.
[282:40.31]Yeah, I'm going to call here too.
[282:48.52]Well, that was an absolute hoot.
[282:53.46]Thanks for hanging out.
[282:54.10]Thanks for watching.
[282:57.62]It's less scary and more thrilling.
[283:00.89]It's still pretty scary though, especially when things run out behind a corner and grab you.
[283:06.77]That was a lot of fun.
[283:07.75]Obviously, that group of guys is really fun to mess around with and play stuff with, so always a pleasure.
[283:17.70]Hope you guys had a good time.
[283:18.84]That was Lethal Company.
[283:21.86]It's very, very popular right now for a reason, obviously, because it's very good.
[283:34.64]Did you play Super Mario RPG?
[283:37.24]I did.
[283:37.46]I think I told you guys I was going to do that on my own time because it's one of my favorite games ever.
[283:42.32]So I can give you the assessment.
[283:48.50]So Super Mario RPG remake, I have pretty much 100% completed everything.
[283:54.18]Yes, even the, you know, we don't have to say it, but yes, I've done pretty much 100% of the entire game.
[284:02.82]Uh, I love, love, love the... I'm gonna call it the end of Super Mario RPG Remake.
[284:15.56]Without saying anything more than that, if you know, you know.
[284:20.97]It was actually really, really cool.
[284:24.33]What they, you know, the end.
[284:31.61]There's no VOD.
[284:32.65]I'll publish it.
[284:33.09]I don't know why I started doing that, but I think the real assessment, it's kind of, it's a little too easy.
[284:41.90]And they added and changed some things, how the combat works.
[284:44.44]You build a meter now and the meter goes to 100% and you do a super move that does tons of damage to every enemy.
[284:52.40]They added splash damage, which just kind of, it makes a lot of the just regular fights pretty trivial.
[285:01.10]I almost wish they had, because they have a normal and they have an easy mode.
[285:05.74]I almost wish that there was a classic mode or something where you didn't have, there was no like super meters or anything.
[285:13.73]But I thought it was good.
[285:14.45]I thought it was great.
[285:15.23]Especially the last two or three hours was a really welcome, interesting, very cool thing.
[285:23.06]And I wish you luck when you get there because it's really, really cool.
[285:35.17]What are you talking about?
[285:35.71]Super Mario RPG remake.
[285:37.99]Mario RPG is one of my favorite games of all time.
[285:41.36]It was weird to play it.
[285:43.42]Weird to see kind of everything the way you remember, but not quite really, just a little different.
[285:54.38]Is it worth playing the remake?
[285:56.60]I will say, for those of you that have played the game dozens of times, there is an absolute reason to play the remake.
[286:04.01]Not just for the remake, but there is a reason to play it if you've seen the same stuff over and over again.
[286:12.91]Yeah, I'll publish the VOD.
[286:13.62]I'll make sure it's there.
[286:21.60]Were you Zonked during this?
[286:23.78]No.
[286:24.77]Just scared.
[286:25.83]Especially the last couple.
[286:27.07]I just panicked.
[286:28.29]That's what happens.
[286:37.04]Did you write your Discord thing yet?
[286:38.46]No, not yet.
[286:40.22]Eh, you'll see it soon.
[286:41.74]I haven't really been paying that much attention to it.
[286:45.32]But yeah, I do plan on posting a big update in the Discord.
[286:50.22]What about the Game Awards?
[286:51.42]Um... When are the Game Awards?
[287:02.99]December 7th.
[287:04.97]I mean, but maybe.
[287:07.23]Next time I stream, I don't know, maybe this after Thanksgiving?
[287:11.77]Maybe like the 25th or 26th or something.
[287:16.26]Maybe this coming weekend.
[287:19.12]Might try to get another big lobby together or something.
[287:21.18]Mod it.
[287:21.82]Leave the company.
[287:26.52]But, happy Thanksgiving if you celebrate it coming up this weekend.
[287:34.64]And I'll see you later.
[287:35.12]Thanks for hanging out.
[287:38.12]Do a 32 player lobby.
[287:44.19]What's your game of the year?
[287:46.65]Um.
[287:51.42]Honestly.
[287:51.90]Probably Pizza Tower.
[287:57.44]Resident Evil 4 Remake was unbelievable, but... I mean, if... Pizza Tower was a completely holy original game.
[288:04.91]Came out of nowhere.
[288:05.58]It was really fun, really super interesting.
[288:09.40]I think it's probably that.
[288:17.24]Yeah, the music was phenomenal.
[288:19.38]The game was phenomenal.
[288:21.38]The little story, the fun characters.
[288:23.56]It checked every single box.
[288:25.66]Gameplay-wise, I'm not good at those kinds of games, but it doesn't really matter.
[288:30.12]I still think it was a blast to do.
[288:37.31]Baldur's Gate 3?
[288:39.31]Yeah, I'll be honest though, I haven't really gone through Baldur's Gate 3.
[288:45.83]Baldur's Gate 3, I started, me and Holly started playing it, but we only got maybe six or seven hours in.
[288:53.68]Got kind of busy.
[288:59.58]Maybe, I'm sure if I played all the way through Baldur's Gate 3, I might have a completely different opinion for you, but as of right now, it's probably Beatstar.
[289:15.80]I gotta look at some other stuff that came out.
[289:17.28]Because I had a lot of fun with some stuff this past year.
[289:21.76]Stuff that came out this year.
[289:27.41]I've heard Alan Wake 2 is unbelievable.
[289:32.15]What about Sorcery?
[289:33.55]Yeah, we do have to finish it.
[289:34.45]There's probably only another 5 or 6 hours left.
[289:40.88]We'll see.
[289:41.28]We'll talk about it after Thanksgiving.
[289:43.52]One of the streams I do after Thanksgiving.
[289:48.33]Did you remove the VOD?
[289:49.45]No, no.
[289:51.13]Twitch just started unpublishing all my VODs.
[289:53.45]I don't know.
[289:53.77]There's probably like a copywritten song or something that got me unpublished.
[289:59.95]But I'll do it right when I turn the stream off.
[290:01.27]Alright.
[290:04.07]See you guys later.
[290:04.51]Take care.
[290:05.47]Have a good Thanksgiving.
[290:06.62]Celebrate it.
[290:07.96]And see you soon.
[290:35.89]Thank you.
