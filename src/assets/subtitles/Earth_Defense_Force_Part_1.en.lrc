[ve:60.16.100]

[00:08.90]I'm gonna mute the whole thing.
[00:11.28]We're not here yet.
[00:12.06]We're live, but we're not here yet.
[00:13.58]Hold on.
[00:13.86]Give us a minute.
[00:42.94]Are you ready?
[00:45.18]We're here.
[00:45.61]Hey, guys.
[00:48.55]Welcome to Fun Friday.
[00:52.17]You know how we do on Fun Friday.
[00:54.83]Get a special guest.
[00:56.50]Here he is.
[00:56.98]Oh, that was so loud.
[01:02.30]You just killed everybody.
[01:03.16]Sorry.
[01:08.44]I just want people to be excited about me.
[01:11.66]Yeah, well, hey, welcome to Fuck You Friday.
[01:15.65]I've never been on a stream before, so I was excited.
[01:18.03]Alright, uh, you ready to do the first mission?
[01:23.97]Do you have any idea how to play this game?
[01:26.53]You point, you click, and you shoot bugs?
[01:29.30]Close enough.
[01:32.00]Okay.
[01:32.90]Hold on, let me make sure this is gonna show up here.
[01:35.94]Oh, it is.
[01:36.82]It is showing up, isn't it?
[01:41.23]Okay, I wanna make sure this doesn't... We're gonna be hit with some fat 50 field of view, some 20 ting rate.
[01:49.08]No, it's 60 FPS and it's third person, so... It's gonna be good.
[01:55.20]It's gonna be good!
[01:56.82]Alright, are you ready?
[01:59.10]Yeah.
[01:59.64]Select mission, we're gonna do reconvenience.
[02:03.39]We're on hard difficulty.
[02:05.63]The game is squash the bugs.
[02:10.30]Why is that funny?
[02:11.64]Is that the actual name of the game mode?
[02:13.74]Squash the Bums.
[02:14.83]That's what we're doing, isn't it?
[02:17.51]I think you're going to get into this game because you shoot the same grey ant over and over again and then you get like an item drop at the very end.
[02:24.97]Oh my god.
[02:27.37]Sounds like a blast.
[02:30.90]Preparation complete.
[02:33.06]Here we go.
[02:34.72]The first ever.
[02:36.42]Crash.
[02:36.88]Are you serious?
[02:38.70]No.
[02:39.80]I didn't even pick my class.
[02:42.98]That's too bad, you'll... No, no, okay, we're both the same person.
[02:46.36]That's fine.
[02:46.78]Alright.
[02:48.55]But my armor is way cuter than your armor.
[02:50.27]Now, you can fly by... Have you played the game Overwatch before?
[02:53.03]Yeah.
[02:53.71]No?
[02:54.81]Well, you have a rocket launcher.
[02:57.25]Just like that character, Pharah.
[02:59.76]Who?
[03:01.84]Uh, your other... Actually, I have different... I'm shooting the people, but they're not dying.
[03:05.56]You're not supposed to be shooting the people.
[03:11.07]I'll squash those bugs.
[03:13.49]This might be a little loud.
[03:14.67]Alright, cover me for a second.
[03:17.07]Cover me while this fucking game is blowing up my eardrums.
[03:20.43]Covering fire.
[03:21.75]Covering fire.
[03:22.79]I have it at 1%.
[03:23.81]Covering fire.
[03:26.27]You are shooting me right now.
[03:29.71]All I hear is... Covering fire.
[03:37.69]I love how you just did like 70 damage to me.
[03:41.33]I don't know what I'm doing.
[03:42.91]You gotta kill the ants, not the people.
[03:45.73]I'm killing the ants.
[03:46.94]We have to protect the city of Townsville.
[03:50.50]That's what this is.
[03:51.12]Oh, Townsville?
[03:53.22]With Doug Dibbenohm?
[03:54.42]No, no.
[03:55.40]Oh no, the Dimmsdale Dibbenohm?
[03:59.54]This is just a warm-up for you.
[04:00.73]Okay.
[04:03.57]Make sure when you fly, don't expel all your gas, because you won't be able to do anything for like a full minute.
[04:09.03]I'm not expelling any gas.
[04:12.19]Make sure you don't expel too much gas.
[04:13.65]Where are you?
[04:14.95]Are you dead?
[04:15.93]I got knocked out because you shot me with a rocket.
[04:17.97]No, I didn't.
[04:19.03]Yes, you did.
[04:20.07]I did not shoot you with a rocket.
[04:21.19]Can I pick you up?
[04:21.69]Well, there's no answer over here.
[04:23.23]Press the vehicle rescue button.
[04:24.47]What the fuck is the vehicle?
[04:25.56]Okay, I got you.
[04:30.50]I can use my laser more often.
[04:31.66]I just got this.
[04:34.34]By the way, there's like shit that falls on the ground.
[04:35.92]There's like health kits and stuff.
[04:37.82]Make sure to grab those, man.
[04:40.73]Oh, I'm going to go grab this armor.
[04:41.79]Do you see the armor over here?
[04:42.71]I'm grabbing this armor.
[04:43.39]I'm going to press the vehicle access button.
[04:45.59]You can see right up my skirt.
[04:49.57]Why did you die?
[04:50.47]This is not battle ready.
[04:51.43]I don't know.
[04:51.91]I picked up the armor and I died.
[04:53.53]I think I just laser beamed you in the face.
[04:57.25]What is going on with this fucking building?
[04:59.41]Alright, we're good.
[05:05.22]The first mission is going to be easy.
[05:06.44]This is just a warm up.
[05:07.34]Don't worry.
[05:09.25]Can you get in the tank?
[05:09.97]I think eventually, maybe.
[05:11.15]Alright, that's it.
[05:13.89]No, we got a little bit more.
[05:14.93]Any health packs that you've stolen from me?
[05:18.25]Yes.
[05:19.77]No.
[05:19.95]I could just rain hell on you right now, but I'm not gonna.
[05:26.12]I feel like this game is one of those games where it's too soft.
[05:30.84]What killed you?
[05:32.72]You did.
[05:34.93]How?
[05:35.35]You airshot me.
[05:36.47]Come lift me up.
[05:37.09]Oh, okay.
[05:38.15]I didn't think I hit you.
[05:39.45]I was trying to, though.
[05:40.37]You gotta come press E on me.
[05:43.78]There's health right there, buddy.
[05:45.42]I'm so slow.
[05:46.72]Alright, we gotta, like, stay separated, because we're gonna end up killing each other a hundred times.
[05:53.09]Check the minimap to make sure you know where the bugs are coming from.
[05:55.05]I see there's lonely bugs on my screen.
[06:01.80]Oh, checking mini-map?
[06:03.26]Check the mini-map to make sure you know where the bugs are.
[06:06.75]Oh shit, I ran out of a thousand.
[06:10.39]You're batting a thousand?
[06:11.69]I ran out of my one thousand.
[06:13.67]That's pretty good.
[06:17.71]Everything is just... Where am I?
[06:18.85]Okay, I'm like in the building.
[06:21.04]Make sure you don't kill the wrong people.
[06:27.12]Ah, fuck.
[06:27.52]I was in the air for too long.
[06:30.03]I know.
[06:31.77]Give me that health pack, quick.
[06:34.37]You think we're ready?
[06:35.09]We're just doing the... No, I mean, as a species, do you think we'd be ready if ants started doing this?
[06:41.72]No.
[06:43.62]We don't have laser lady wingsuit people.
[06:47.42]I know, but we have more than one person willing to fight.
[06:51.63]It's me, you, and this tank.
[06:52.99]Why did that happen?
[06:53.79]Why did that happen?
[06:57.71]That whole building just came down.
[06:59.55]Kill that last ant!
[07:00.51]Before he shits!
[07:06.85]You're causing more damage to the city than the ants.
[07:10.40]Also, thank you, uh... Alamoban for seven months.
[07:13.56]Saiko of Meerkat.
[07:14.86]Yeah.
[07:15.70]SAB 3600 for eight months.
[07:16.52]Um... So, you get under a building and I'll blow it up.
[07:20.18]How about that?
[07:20.80]No!
[07:23.30]We're on a hard mode in the tutorial.
[07:24.62]This is the hard tutorial.
[07:27.66]That's all you need to know.
[07:31.60]Just wait till you get... Just wait till I watch.
[07:33.08]I'm gonna blow this lady up.
[07:36.14]Why?
[07:37.11]You're dead.
[07:41.59]Were you the lady?
[07:43.31]Apparently.
[07:45.27]Come get me.
[07:45.81]Thank you.
[07:53.32]I'm gonna just use my regular fucking stupid beam.
[07:59.61]I don't think that these ants would have enough food to feed their queen.
[08:03.93]Because people aren't a great food source.
[08:05.82]We're very small compared to them and usually they're carrying whole caterpillars back to their lair, you know what I mean?
[08:11.50]I guess.
[08:13.46]But I think they're going to starve and we don't even have to fight them.
[08:16.40]I think we got the tutorial done.
[08:20.32]That's it.
[08:21.66]There's not a large enough food source anywhere in the world for these.
[08:27.54]No, that's not the end of it.
[08:28.30]There's a little bit more tutorial.
[08:29.60]There's a little bit more.
[08:32.85]Somebody said, as a kid, I genuinely had a reoccurring nightmare that was similar to this.
[08:39.61]What, you're fucking playing a game with Jerma?
[08:46.01]Yeah, I kept having the same nightmare where I was playing with this guy.
[08:49.80]I fucking hated his guts.
[08:52.72]I didn't like him.
[08:56.76]Alright.
[08:59.86]Easy.
[09:00.40]Be careful.
[09:01.26]This is the true test.
[09:02.42]They know that we're beating the tutorial too fast.
[09:05.94]Oh, it's scalable difficulty.
[09:08.23]It is.
[09:09.09]What's happening?
[09:14.21]Okay, I have no... Watch out.
[09:15.35]I'm dropping a bomb.
[09:17.69]Ooh.
[09:18.88]Ooh.
[09:19.42]How do you drop a bomb?
[09:20.84]I'm just in the air doing fucking justice.
[09:23.32]Oh.
[09:26.88]Okay, when you find a box that says weapon on it and you don't get anything, what does that mean?
[09:35.41]No, no, no, it's like, uh, hold on, help me, help me, I'm out of juice, I'm out of juice!
[09:40.13]Uh, at the end of the mission, if we complete it, we get items.
[09:47.38]Get in the air!
[09:48.90]Gotta kill this thing, I'm getting, like, eaten right now.
[09:53.71]God, this is, I've had this nightmare.
[09:56.69]Let me come res you.
[10:02.86]What is happening to my character?
[10:04.42]I'm just being slammed into the ground over and over again.
[10:08.50]Alright, don't kill this owl.
[10:11.82]It's still eating me.
[10:15.28]Okay, it finally got done eating me.
[10:19.24]There's like 40 ants chasing me.
[10:21.22]Get up here quick.
[10:28.29]Oh, you're almost here.
[10:31.03]Nice.
[10:31.55]Wow, that was such a cool move you did.
[10:36.04]You can actually shoot me.
[10:36.86]Where are you?
[10:37.80]You just shot me.
[10:40.72]Wait, what?
[10:41.92]Why did I get shot?
[10:46.42]Help me.
[10:48.95]I have one HP.
[10:50.95]Res me.
[10:53.05]The hard tutorial.
[10:54.79]I can't.
[10:55.55]I can't.
[10:56.55]I can't.
[10:57.73]Why not?
[10:58.41]I don't know.
[10:58.71]I'm like standing next to you and I can't do it.
[11:01.37]Apparently I can't.
[11:04.15]Give me the health before I fucking get eaten.
[11:07.17]Oh, thank god.
[11:07.75]Alright, that was actually scary.
[11:10.07]Alright, we're good.
[11:13.63]Look at all this shit that's over here.
[11:16.27]That was kind of scary, actually.
[11:19.31]Especially at the end.
[11:19.93]Give me that last thing.
[11:27.08]right you see items dude level 11. yeah well what a thunder bow what is that that's kind of cool uh this is level two there you go I think I think that is that equipment for your character or equipment for somebody else
[11:45.55]I wonder.
[11:46.73]But I got to say thanks to some people.
[11:48.35]Start.
[11:48.63]Just give me one sec.
[11:49.97]Oh, yeah.
[11:50.43]It's a big shout out.
[11:52.35]But for real, though, I want to say thanks to Sab3600 for eight months to save our Mother Earth from any alien attack.
[11:58.65]Thanks, Sab.

[12:56.58]Let's keep going.
[12:59.78]Alright, go into your class equipment and see what you have.
[13:02.56]Yeah, if you change classes, like, I didn't get any weapons for the other classes, but I wanted to try one, you know what I mean?
[13:07.98]Alright, well, let's... But, like, you don't know what I mean.
[13:13.15]Air Raider is... No, I do.
[13:14.63]So, what is this?
[13:15.13]What is Limpet Gun?
[13:18.65]A device which launches a sticky bomb that attaches to whatever surface it strikes.
[13:25.16]Okay.
[13:25.26]Okay.
[13:27.57]What are you gonna play this time?
[13:30.55]I'm gonna play the same one with new weapons same one our howitzer artillery squad Because you have level zero weapons, and I have a level 17 weapon that sounds higher.
[13:41.35]I Mean these I have level zero on this guy right now because yeah, that's what I mean Well, I level 17 is a lot higher than zero so I figure if you play one mission with a character one time your character locked No Just play with it.
[13:54.32]Who cares play with another person
[13:57.25]That's the same thing you said when we broke up.
[13:59.75]Well, we got back together again.
[14:01.99]That's what, that's what matters.
[14:03.79]It won't.
[14:05.30]All right, so I have like sticky launcher grenades.
[14:07.44]Let me see what these look like.
[14:08.30]Okay, how do I detonate?
[14:10.94]Oh, that's kind of cool.
[14:12.62]So I detonate with right.
[14:13.98]Okay, I detonate them all though.
[14:15.26]That's the one weird thing.
[14:16.92]So can I launch them over?
[14:19.12]What the hell are you doing?
[14:20.08]All right, what is this?
[14:25.41]Yeah, see, this is why I didn't want to play a different character.
[14:30.08]Because this weapon seems broken.
[14:32.36]I think, okay, I don't know what that does.
[14:33.76]I'm just shooting, like, stickies and detonating them right now.
[14:38.12]I think I just threw, like, a grenade.
[14:44.28]What the heck?
[14:45.20]Who nuked the city?
[14:52.86]I think I might need you to help me.
[14:56.97]Turn around and come get me.
[14:59.51]Can I flop around like a fish?
[15:03.06]Quick before the... Dinner soon.
[15:05.00]Alright.
[15:05.46]That's what that does.
[15:06.04]You're just going to keep playing the nuke character.
[15:08.94]Okay, I don't have another one.
[15:10.40]It's reloading.
[15:11.10]It takes a while to reload apparently.
[15:12.84]I have like a tank or something.
[15:13.86]Let's get a tank in here.
[15:17.86]Does it drop?
[15:18.52]Where does it come from?
[15:20.00]How do I get in the tank?
[15:24.73]Come on, quick.
[15:25.63]I need to get in this tank.
[15:32.34]Watch out, this thing right here.
[15:34.80]Got it.
[15:38.46]Where is it?
[15:40.04]Oh, okay, right there, okay.
[15:41.34]Get in the tank.
[15:41.94]I'm dead.
[15:43.40]How do I get in the tank?
[15:47.76]Please, please revive me.
[15:49.45]The tank is fucking exploded.
[15:51.49]I don't know how to get in the tank.
[15:53.17]We lose.
[15:56.23]How do you enter the tank?
[15:59.15]I was pressing E. It wasn't doing anything.
[16:04.75]All right, I'm gonna throw that down immediately.
[16:06.19]10 out of 10.
[16:11.94]This is the first two missions.
[16:14.04]Give us how it, hold on.
[16:17.02]Give us how it.
[16:17.92]Just wait a second.
[16:18.92]Just wait a minute, I'm gonna throw one of these super grenades.
[16:22.98]Okay, I'm just going to stand back and watch.
[16:24.58]No, I threw it real far.
[16:25.96]My guy has a fucking arm of steel.
[16:28.31]Just watch the city's skylines get destroyed.
[16:32.43]Watch this.
[16:33.03]You watching?
[16:33.97]I'm watching.
[16:34.83]You got your eyes on the prize?
[16:35.83]Because all those ants.
[16:38.39]Oh, oh.
[16:39.41]Yeah, I did that.
[16:41.31]All right, now get me inside of this thing.
[16:44.98]It looks like none of the ants died.
[16:46.28]All right, I'm in the tank.
[16:49.14]Can you get in here too?
[16:51.54]How did you get in?
[16:52.48]There's like a big circle.
[16:54.66]Are you using a fire hose right now?
[16:57.48]I just shot like a pedestrian.
[17:01.12]I asked you how to get in the tank, and you just told me to press circle?
[17:04.55]No, just get in the- there's a big circle!
[17:06.33]I'm just gonna ram this guy.
[17:10.97]Where did he go?
[17:11.45]Alright, that guy disappeared.
[17:12.81]Alright, can you get in?
[17:18.34]There's no circle.
[17:21.24]Well, then I'll give you covering fire.
[17:23.10]You take all the big guys.
[17:25.77]I'm going in.
[17:27.29]That gun's kind of cool.
[17:28.15]What is it, like a lightning gun?
[17:30.65]Yeah, and I have like a super lightning shotgun.
[17:32.81]I need to like turn this.
[17:33.79]Hold on.
[17:36.59]I can like actually hear now.
[17:40.37]It's hard for me to get random one-offs like this guy.
[17:44.04]No, he's dead.
[17:46.28]I kind of like this character knowing now how to actually play with it.
[17:51.62]I don't want to pick up all these healths.
[17:52.76]How are you doing?
[17:56.06]I'm fine.
[17:57.04]Alright, nice.
[17:58.58]Hard.
[17:58.96]This game's not even hard.
[18:01.31]Watch out, watch this guy.
[18:01.93]Look out for this guy.
[18:08.43]He's not even dead, he's still alive.
[18:11.45]Kappa!
[18:13.94]You're a funny streamer.
[18:19.36]Why do I feel like this game keeps lowering and raising the volume mid-fight?
[18:22.94]Yeah, I can't hear what this guy is saying.
[18:27.30]They have evolved!
[18:29.30]Alright, the tank makes this kinda easy.
[18:31.40]I suggest a tank.
[18:34.66]I suggest the hold down left click lightning laser.
[18:37.82]Do you?
[18:38.26]By the way, this gun is called a sniper.
[18:43.54]Can anybody hear anything?
[18:46.90]Alright, now the audio is back.
[18:49.49]Maybe when the people are talking, somehow?
[18:58.16]Wait, there's actually voice commands?
[19:00.06]I'll have to check those out.
[19:07.08]I tried using the voice commands, but they're not saying anything.
[19:10.15]Can you stop dropping buildings on me?
[19:11.97]I'm not doing that.
[19:15.43]I kind of want to get out of the tank now.
[19:16.93]And drop it on the giant thing.
[19:18.57]Yeah, alright.
[19:19.75]Yeah, there's a lot of guys up there in the park.
[19:23.21]That might be too close.
[19:24.69]That's a little too close, I think.
[19:26.55]Back it up.
[19:28.53]Back it up by like 300 feet.
[19:29.51]I think that should clear them all out.
[19:35.83]At least I think.
[19:38.19]That's too bright to look at.
[19:39.65]This guy kind of feels a little overpowered.
[19:45.94]Well, I mean, at the same time, nothing actually died.
[19:48.78]I guess so.
[19:50.60]Like, all those bombs, there's still the same amount of ants right here.
[19:56.27]Watch out for the building!
[20:01.63]Somebody said that... Okay, that bug just shit on me.
[20:04.61]They have, like, honey.
[20:05.25]They squirt honey at you.
[20:06.17]Watch out.
[20:07.73]I don't think you ever released that video.
[20:09.87]Oh, no, I remember.
[20:10.71]I deleted the clip.
[20:11.49]But they're doing your soldier impression.
[20:13.72]What soldier impression?
[20:16.04]I'll protect you.
[20:17.44]I'm your soldier.
[20:19.15]I need ammo.
[20:20.13]This thing's out of ammo.
[20:22.81]I guess the green is the ammo?
[20:25.73]At least I thought so.
[20:27.01]Maybe you can only have a certain amount before you can't use it anymore?
[20:29.81]The tank might just be done.
[20:31.37]Yeah, it might be.
[20:31.89]Because the green is just getting weapon unlocked.
[20:34.81]I have another one.
[20:36.11]I'll put it over here.
[20:37.99]I'll use my detonators.
[20:40.89]Alright.
[20:43.68]This thing's kind of cool, actually.
[20:46.06]It ain't bad.
[20:50.20]One more ant.
[20:51.82]Ooh!
[20:52.28]That didn't even kill him.
[20:57.33]And we did it.
[20:58.41]Tutorial part two complete.
[21:01.25]No.
[21:07.39]This is not funny to do that.
[21:08.59]I'm sorry.
[21:09.01]I don't know why I keep doing that.
[21:11.45]I wish I could hear what this guy was saying.
[21:13.47]Me too.
[21:16.27]Why is this, like, the second game this week that has, like, weird audio problems?
[21:22.53]Confirm for third worst stream ever?
[21:24.31]And then there's a gorilla reading the book.
[21:29.10]I wish I could just put that up.
[21:29.98]Okay, new tank.
[21:33.24]I guess.
[21:33.54]Let's check it out.
[21:36.64]Alright, now we're in Winged War Goddess, apparently.
[21:40.86]let's see olympic launcher 18 it's just like a better version let's put it on and then I'm gonna try boring guy olympic launcher eat that tank what the fuck is going on I just joined this ants and tanks
[22:04.45]Here we go.
[22:05.19]Armored vehicle.
[22:05.91]Armored grape vehicle.
[22:08.55]Grape?
[22:09.17]I guess if we get to have some grapes.
[22:11.25]I don't know what it is.
[22:11.77]We're going to try it.
[22:15.97]I want to change my color too.
[22:17.09]I want to look like blue.
[22:18.39]I'm going to do the germa colors.
[22:21.06]Oh, can we get a shout out to some of the germs in chat?
[22:24.70]Anybody here a germ?
[22:26.44]Can't even do it.
[22:27.66]Raise your germs.
[22:30.68]Did you adjust your armor too?
[22:32.96]Yes.
[22:33.59]Okay, let's go!
[22:38.50]Limp Biscuit Launcher?
[22:44.18]I tried playing with this guy.
[22:46.12]He's so slow.
[22:48.06]I can't do it.
[22:48.78]Ranger?
[22:49.16]Spencer.
[22:51.46]Oh.
[22:52.78]I'm trying the Ranger.
[22:54.02]Ranger.
[22:54.52]Ooh, he's got a big old roll.
[22:56.92]Oh, this one is on me.
[22:58.18]Did you see me drop that bridge?
[23:02.45]Like, this game is... I need... I can't even hear.
[23:08.09]But then now, like, it's too loud.
[23:09.83]I have no idea.
[23:14.19]Hopefully you guys can hear the game and us talking.
[23:16.11]Alright, I'm gonna see what this is.
[23:19.77]We're gonna go with the grape.
[23:22.27]Watch out for the grape.
[23:27.03]No, that was me.
[23:27.71]I did that too.
[23:28.93]No.
[23:29.69]What do you mean no?
[23:30.19]I threw a grenade, and I didn't know it was a sticky grenade, and the ant in front of me was just holding on to it.
[23:35.23]Okay, so you have to have at least 50% HP to resurrect somebody.
[23:41.58]This new rocket launcher is fucking awesome, by the way.
[23:43.48]Alright, what is the grape?
[23:48.16]I think you can get in this.
[23:51.12]Yeah, you can definitely get in this.
[23:51.94]Did you just hear that?
[23:52.86]No, what happened?
[23:55.37]Get in the grape.
[23:56.85]Hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[23:58.02]Stop driving the grape.
[23:59.08]Don't shoot, it's Pac-Man balls!
[24:02.30]Oh, I can't do anything, I'm just sitting in the back.
[24:04.48]Excuse me.
[24:05.62]What do you mean you can't do anything?
[24:07.76]It's like a transport vehicle.
[24:09.18]Like, I just sit in the back and wait.
[24:11.30]You can't do anything.
[24:12.80]No.
[24:13.31]Alright, well watch this.
[24:21.49]Also, this character sucks.
[24:23.53]Who are you playing as?
[24:26.55]Ranger.
[24:28.17]I thought that character was, like, THE EDF character.
[24:31.99]Pretty much, but, like, why wouldn't you want to be able to fly?
[24:34.25]I don't know, maybe because she... And now I'm not rolling anymore.
[24:37.54]Maybe at later levels she's not that good.
[24:38.88]Alright, they're gonna come down this hallway, right?
[24:42.34]Alright, artillery howitzer.
[24:45.56]One, two... No, that's way too far.
[24:47.77]Right there.
[24:48.95]Here we go.
[24:50.45]Watch yourself.
[24:52.43]As we're about to light up the sky!
[24:58.11]Here it comes!
[25:02.17]Why did it land here?
[25:05.31]No, why did it land there?
[25:06.67]That was stupid.
[25:08.60]Hold on, I'll get you.
[25:11.68]You are so fucking far away.
[25:14.84]My corpse may have been whipped away by explosions.
[25:19.18]I don't know who's to be held responsible.
[25:21.47]I threw that pretty far away too.
[25:22.91]It's alright, we both have no health.
[25:28.48]I'm so slow.
[25:30.48]This character is useless without his vehicle.
[25:36.71]Oh, I thought I could get him with a big air shot.
[25:41.83]I'm coming.
[25:42.29]I'm getting back in my car.
[25:45.81]Step on the gas.
[25:49.08]Find the voice commands.
[25:50.04]Why is this thing smoking?
[25:52.86]I have voice commands.
[25:57.89]I'm just not hearing myself say anything out loud.
[26:01.51]Why are all of our crew members all the way back there?
[26:04.70]Shouldn't they be up here with us?
[26:06.40]They're scared.
[26:07.06]Tell them to get the fuck over here.
[26:10.96]Watch out.
[26:11.36]Watch out.
[26:11.64]We got a cretin.
[26:16.27]This thing's kind of hard to control.
[26:17.47]I like the other one better.
[26:26.39]That looks like it's auto-targeting.
[26:27.55]That's weird.
[26:34.98]Alright, let's keep going.
[26:35.82]Remember guys, we're playing on hard difficulty.
[26:41.91]That means we're light.
[26:42.65]This is not to be taken lightly.
[26:44.39]No, it's not.
[26:50.17]I didn't know it was blowing up.
[26:54.53]There goes my tank.
[26:59.67]This is a bunch of Legos.
[27:03.82]Hey, it's alright.
[27:04.20]We got health here.
[27:07.50]There's plenty of health for us.
[27:09.28]I got another grape.
[27:13.71]You need some health, buddy.
[27:14.49]Yeah, pick this health up.
[27:15.81]Well, how are you doing?
[27:16.61]You good?
[27:17.55]I'm 20.
[27:19.08]Wait for my tank here.
[27:24.02]One more.
[27:24.36]You get that health.
[27:24.94]You're the one that's on the ground.
[27:25.86]I have a giant armored tank.
[27:29.28]Alright, drop it.
[27:29.84]I wanted to make sure that it couldn't hurt me.
[27:38.57]No, not in the back.
[27:41.87]Maybe eventually I can get a plane or something.
[27:45.18]There's just two ants left that are stuck inside walls over here.
[27:48.34]Oh, well.
[27:49.84]This can't be it.
[27:56.39]One more?
[27:57.07]In that alleyway, I think?
[28:00.63]We'll hold the thing up.
[28:03.97]Hold on.
[28:04.47]I'll take care of this.
[28:06.13]No, it's gonna take like 30 minutes for me to take care of that.
[28:08.45]Alright, yeah, there's more over there.
[28:12.41]Yeah, get in.
[28:12.89]Just get in.
[28:13.59]I can go faster than you.
[28:24.85]Straight ahead I'm gonna cut on the left here I Actually can't see a thing This is like we're in urban right now
[28:42.53]We're in urban, guys.
[28:43.33]We're in urban right now.
[28:45.25]This is a one-way street.
[28:46.53]Okay.
[28:47.75]Get out.
[28:49.10]No.
[28:54.52]They're fighting.
[28:54.96]They're on the tank.
[28:56.38]I think I can just, like, attract them on me.
[28:58.18]And you can take care of them.
[29:01.43]Uh, this guy does no damage.
[29:04.05]With the gun that I have.
[29:05.57]Well, let me just level it up, then.
[29:09.57]I have to shoot a full clip of about 140 shots to kill an ant.
[29:14.38]Is what I learned from the ones that were stuck in the buildings.
[29:16.38]It's actually not a bad place for them to be, because they just trickle in, and they're only hurting me.
[29:25.58]Not terrible.
[29:26.22]As long as I stay in this.
[29:29.46]Oh.
[29:30.94]Okay, right when I say it, huh?
[29:32.13]You gonna do that to me right when I say it?
[29:36.67]No!
[29:37.77]Get the fuck away from me!
[29:42.57]Alright, buildings are just going down.
[29:45.63]Where are you?
[29:47.45]Roll.
[29:49.06]I'm in the nasty.
[29:51.76]Oh, shit.
[29:52.46]I'm in trouble.
[29:53.36]He's got me.
[29:56.60]He's got me.
[29:57.00]I don't know where he's taking me.
[29:58.66]I'm dead.
[30:02.30]I'm so far away.
[30:04.56]I've been back rolling down the street throwing grenades.
[30:09.71]Oh.
[30:15.62]No!
[30:18.11]There's so many!
[30:21.13]Well, that's a mission fail.
[30:22.29]Wait, can one of the civilians pick us up?
[30:28.79]Oh, no.
[30:30.00]I want to re-prep.
[30:31.88]I do too.
[30:36.62]I don't like that tank.
[30:37.46]I also want to be... I don't like having level 0 weapons.
[30:41.52]I'm going to be Ranger.
[30:46.55]I don't like having level 0 weapons either, but I feel like the rocket launcher is good.
[30:49.52]Yeah, we'll get him next time.
[30:58.30]Um... Yeah, I'm going to go ranger.
[31:00.96]He's going to do straight up defaults.
[31:08.78]Enjoy.
[31:09.22]Yeah, but I feel like this guy... No, fuck that.
[31:12.58]Enjoy!
[31:12.82]I'm gonna go back to, uh, Wing Diver.
[31:15.42]At least I, like, have good weapons with the Wing Diver.
[31:18.30]Come on, can we just do Karazhan?
[31:20.68]Let's go!
[31:21.30]Go.
[31:23.94]Thrust, parry, smash.
[31:25.70]You reading up on this?
[31:31.18]Yes.
[31:31.44]Somebody said I smell like pee.
[31:32.66]Is that true?
[31:33.30]You've seen me in real life.
[31:34.77]Oh, does the fencer have melee weapons?
[31:37.77]I think it's possible.
[31:39.99]Yeah, you had on my loading screen.
[31:44.15]Okay, look at how much better this is.
[31:54.01]Holy shit, you are shitting me.
[31:54.91]This character is ridiculous.
[31:56.79]You are shitting so many of those.
[31:58.35]Remember, we used to have the plasma gun only.
[32:00.73]Now it shoots three at once, and you're going to tell me to play a ranger.
[32:05.64]I didn't know that.
[32:12.38]I have this beam gun.
[32:14.06]I really like that.
[32:14.94]This guy's over here.
[32:15.72]Watch out for the ant to the right, left, I mean.
[32:21.04]Can't kill that guy, okay.
[32:26.70]Alright.
[32:28.07]Well, that went way more smoothly.
[32:30.27]Alright, cool.
[32:31.75]We're actually doing damage.
[32:33.03]Looks like we're gonna be these characters for a little while.
[32:35.11]That's what I'm saying.
[32:37.29]Unless you find items for another character while you're playing as this...
[32:42.54]Yeah, it's pretty damn good.
[32:45.10]Straight ahead.
[32:45.71]Arc your missiles.
[32:48.59]Whoa.
[32:56.51]Whoa.
[33:01.67]Fuck these buildings.
[33:03.03]Yeah, they're kind of just getting in the way, aren't they?
[33:09.26]Nice.
[33:10.62]Oh.
[33:12.36]Yeah, where we got into trouble is we flew up there with my tank.
[33:15.72]That was a stupid idea.
[33:18.81]That was dumb.
[33:19.49]I wonder what the bosses are like in this game.
[33:30.42]They're gonna be huge.
[33:31.60]I hope they're, like, enormous.
[33:32.82]If they're not big, then I'm gonna be very mad if there even is bosses in the game.
[33:36.22]I am pretty sure there are, and I'm pretty sure they're huge.
[33:43.22]Ooh, that was a good shot.
[33:45.66]Watch out, there's one coming around.
[33:46.68]Where the hell is he?
[33:48.72]Oh, he's on top.
[33:53.71]Now, either play the generic soldiers or play the rain-from-above death lady.
[33:59.41]I kind of like the soldier's movement like I did.
[34:01.39]But not having a weapon form makes it worse.
[34:04.35]I'm gonna see some pogchamps for that one.
[34:05.79]What were you saying?
[34:11.52]Sorry.
[34:13.37]I liked the ranger's roll.
[34:15.25]I did.
[34:15.95]But his weapon took like a hundred shots to kill one ant.
[34:21.05]So unless I get a not level zero weapon... I'm character locked.
[34:25.35]I said it.
[34:26.21]I could tell.
[34:26.65]What's game design?
[34:30.25]Come on.
[34:31.41]Why don't you have full health?
[34:34.47]We need to be in full health.
[34:35.71]Oh, perfect.
[34:36.29]Right down fucking main street.
[34:38.03]Oof.
[34:39.95]Oh, that's so satisfying.
[34:46.03]But, okay, did you get like a fucking legendary or something?
[34:48.71]I don't understand.
[34:49.10]I have the same thing you have.
[34:50.58]It just shoots three.
[34:53.06]Really?
[34:53.80]Yeah, I got a legendary.
[34:54.76]Where's my legendary?
[34:58.86]You played as the other character.
[35:00.32]That was your mistake.
[35:01.95]Your character locked you.
[35:03.89]Pick one and play it.
[35:06.53]Ah, shit.
[35:06.99]And the missions are just gonna get harder than this, too.
[35:09.69]Yeah.
[35:10.63]Oh, can I just tell you how fucking giant flying that is?
[35:14.47]Fucking lady.
[35:20.81]Holy dude, that lady flew by the screen.
[35:22.99]That was so giant flying.
[35:25.31]What the fuck is your problem?
[35:26.85]Did you see that air shot, dude?
[35:31.66]That was so giant flying.
[35:33.00]That was so giant flying.
[35:34.10]Alright, I'm done with that one.
[35:39.74]One more cleaned up.
[35:40.40]I don't think you are.
[35:41.24]No, I'm done.
[35:41.94]Alright, this is where we got in a lot of trouble.
[35:45.68]Onto the basketball court.
[35:48.84]I think it's pretty inaccurate though, the thing you're using.
[35:51.78]Doesn't matter when there's that many ants and you can fly up in the air and shoot down at them.
[35:57.15]Easy.
[36:01.71]Just shoot the buildings head on.
[36:04.45]Alright, well, we'll back it up.
[36:06.29]Stay with the troops, because it seems like if you don't do that, you kind of screw yourself over.
[36:12.17]Yeah, support our troops.
[36:13.31]Oh my god.
[36:15.55]What are you using for a secondary?
[36:18.45]Some weird homing laser gun.
[36:27.33]I have this weird direct damage thing.
[36:29.19]It's pretty good.
[36:34.86]Pick up the green boxes to get new weapons.
[36:36.70]Oh my god, is this the school where Kagome went?
[36:39.28]Oh, okay.
[36:41.00]Make sure you pick up every single green box.
[36:43.46]That's what I'm saying.
[36:44.30]Yes.
[36:44.94]Obviously.
[36:45.38]Yes.
[36:45.78]I thought that was like ammo.
[36:48.84]No, I said before that's how you get new weapons.
[36:51.29]Shut up.
[36:51.65]Shut up.
[36:53.17]God, when you go over those green boxes and you hear like the ding-ding, you know what that is?
[36:57.67]No, it's really interesting.
[37:03.94]It scratches some weird itch when you pick it up.
[37:06.37]So, it's like, something about it is very... I can't... I don't have the right word for it.
[37:11.43]Easy, I'm down here.
[37:15.23]I am down here.
[37:16.05]I don't like how long you have to wait between some of these shots, though.
[37:21.18]But you are like a nuker.
[37:24.88]I think I'm going to bite the bullet and just pick Ranger next time.
[37:28.28]I feel like there's some fun stuff with him.
[37:31.57]I kind of want to try Fencer.
[37:32.57]Hey, how about this?
[37:33.59]Yep.
[37:34.88]Let's both be, like, losers.
[37:37.30]Okay.
[37:38.26]And play the first mission again as different characters.
[37:41.52]That we can get new weapons, and then we can, like, see if we enjoy it.
[37:44.92]Because I don't think we're going to be able to beat a mission like this unless we have at least something that's not level 0.
[37:50.24]Yeah, probably not.
[37:51.64]Alright, let's do level 1.
[37:52.57]I'm going to beat Ranger.
[37:54.39]Because it goes from level 0 to level 10 from one mission.
[37:58.81]Oh, look at all that goodies.
[37:59.81]Look at all those goodies.
[38:00.45]That is a lot of shit, though.
[38:01.45]Wait, is it... Yeah, that's a lot of stuff.
[38:04.25]Okay.
[38:04.97]I already have, like, level 20 weapons for this.
[38:06.87]Why would I want to be level... Yeah, that's not satisfying.
[38:09.42]That's not... That is not... That is not... Not... Hi.
[38:14.94]Hi.
[38:16.00]Alright, give me a second.
[38:19.82]Alright, while we set up the next one, I just want to say a very special thanks to Zombieman4 for eight months.
[38:24.61]I love this game.
[38:25.33]It's freaking awesome.
[38:26.01]It does seem like it's pretty fun.
[38:28.52]It feels like a little grindy, but that might be a good thing because you want to get cool items.
[38:32.02]I don't know.
[38:33.44]Bizcasual, four months.
[38:34.40]Thanks a lot.
[38:34.88]Oscar Take.
[38:36.82]Ender Rourke.
[38:38.02]The Fresh Breath.
[38:38.83]Arkham Cats.
[38:39.73]Real Grayson for three months.
[38:41.01]Hey, Real Grayson.
[38:41.93]How are you?
[38:42.57]I've seen you in the chat before.
[38:45.39]Much love, dude.
[38:46.75]I think I already said hi to Solair777.
[38:49.33]Lucky number seven.
[38:50.25]Ace Trainer.
[38:50.77]Alex2.
[38:51.35]Alamobin.
[38:51.83]Psycho.
[38:52.17]Meerkat.
[38:54.05]Alamobin was seven months, by the way.
[38:56.64]I think I got everybody.
[38:57.48]What about on the bit department?
[38:59.64]Jörg with 420 bits.
[39:01.93]Todd with the 500.
[39:02.77]Todd, you are the king of the 500 bits.
[39:07.55]You are like the king and queen of 500.
[39:09.35]Thanks a lot, guys.
[39:11.67]And then Mukawa250, thanks a lot.
[39:13.24]Is this the set of the new German film, Spatuli Saloon Ant Edition?
[39:18.76]Yes.
[39:20.74]Alright, we're gonna go do the first mission again.
[39:25.57]uh somebody says you get absolutely ridiculous guns if you play on the hardest difficulty that's what we're doing oh inferno I mean should you want to try doing inferno on the first I want to I want to just do the first mission normal and get some guns and see how I like fencer okay
[39:40.70]Just so you chill out for a second, we're going to ramp this stream up in 10 seconds.
[39:43.87]You know what I'm talking about?
[39:44.81]Speaking of the stream, the audio sounds really weird to me.
[39:48.29]Weird?
[39:48.97]What?
[39:51.39]On the stream, people watching, does it sound okay?
[39:54.51]Can you hear the audio and shit, or is it terrible?
[39:56.55]Because I feel like it's awful.
[39:57.95]Just because I think it's awful when I listen to it.
[39:59.54]Alright, let's go.
[40:04.56]Inferno or Riot?
[40:06.32]We'll eventually do it.
[40:07.91]Did you select the first mission?
[40:09.03]I don't think you did.
[40:09.89]Oh, I didn't.
[40:10.29]Yeah, okay.
[40:12.92]We can do the second mission.
[40:14.58]The first mission is so brainless.
[40:20.66]Okay.
[40:21.40]It's good?
[40:21.92]It's alright?
[40:22.42]Okay.
[40:22.62]Do you believe these guys are level 0?
[40:26.20]I can, because we haven't played with them.
[40:31.27]Game sounds a little quiet.
[40:37.90]Fencer is the best option in the later levels.
[40:39.56]Oh my god, he's so slow.
[40:40.68]Yeah, that's what I was saying.
[40:41.58]He's fucking so slow.
[40:45.92]But I have Blast Hole Spears.
[40:48.26]Oh no, he has a dash?
[40:49.57]No, he has like, um... There's like five abilities with that guy.
[40:55.13]Well, he gets two weapons.
[40:57.29]And you can switch weapons and have one on each hand.
[41:02.01]Oh my goodness.
[41:02.63]I like this guy's dash.
[41:03.91]This Gatling gun is so hard to control.
[41:07.49]The dash is good, but this thing's pretty weak.
[41:13.13]Oh my god, that game, we're getting a little overwhelmed here.
[41:18.12]Grenade out!
[41:23.22]Be careful, I might have just, no.
[41:24.94]You're good, you're good.
[41:29.51]I like the Dark Souls dodge.
[41:31.35]That works for me.
[41:31.99]Yeah, that's what I'm saying, I like the Ranger, it's just that I had the worst weapon ever.
[41:39.61]This looks like a great arcade game.
[41:42.33]Yeah, it kind of is.
[41:43.03]There's somebody behind us.
[41:48.05]Shit, it takes two rockets to kill- what?
[41:49.63]Are you serious?
[41:51.77]What the fuck?
[41:53.66]I insta-died.
[41:55.30]You dead?
[41:55.86]Oh no.
[41:56.04]Uh, hold on.
[41:58.66]When I get a second, I'll get you.
[42:00.04]And that's what I'm talking about, the low-level weapon.
[42:04.06]It takes you so long to kill the ants.
[42:07.98]Compared to fly around and blast super bombs.
[42:13.21]I don't want to get up there too far.
[42:14.63]I don't want to kill myself getting you.
[42:18.01]Coward.
[42:19.39]Also, you can only roll left or right, so you have to turn your camera to roll forward.
[42:24.01]Yeah, I noticed that too.
[42:27.23]Any green packages?
[42:28.31]Oh, get this, get this.
[42:28.97]There's like a full first aid over here.
[42:32.93]There it goes.
[42:35.85]Ooh, yummy.
[42:36.62]How much health do you have?
[42:37.48]What's, like, your actual health pool?
[42:40.58]Um, I think it goes up to 200.
[42:42.16]Maybe about a 250.
[42:45.42]Everyone's calling me a coward.
[42:48.30]Why?
[42:48.58]Because I, like, waited to get you.
[42:50.42]I wasn't even leading my shots right.
[42:53.15]I'm fucking so dumb.
[42:55.05]Let me kill this guy.
[42:55.93]Yeah, over here.
[42:59.41]Yeah.
[43:03.57]No, maybe not.
[43:05.09]I don't see any greenies.
[43:08.95]I'm so confused.
[43:10.01]I don't have a dash anymore.
[43:11.69]Now I only go up in the air.
[43:13.51]Do you have like a separate bar?
[43:14.63]For the dash?
[43:19.04]I don't know.
[43:22.40]Alright, watch out.
[43:23.22]I'm just gonna start fucking whipping grenades.
[43:25.18]Oh fuck, watch out!
[43:25.76]What?
[43:26.08]God damn it!
[43:27.88]Why did that detonate instantly?
[43:30.62]Why did that explode in one second?
[43:33.42]I'm dying.
[43:35.92]Help me?
[43:36.92]I am, I am.
[43:38.44]He's still- you're still in his mouth after I shot him fucking four times.
[43:41.68]Well, see, because you suck and we don't do any damage.
[43:45.86]Why did that- dude, I threw a grenade on the ground, it was like- I do not like this character.
[43:53.14]Oh boy.
[43:54.56]I think we'll complete it.
[43:56.34]I don't know, go ahead, call me a coward, but we're gonna win.
[44:00.66]There's no timer for me to pick you up, right?
[44:04.38]Coward.
[44:05.64]Just side-roll at me, then side-roll out.
[44:08.46]No!
[44:08.72]You think there's so many of them?
[44:11.93]I'm staying with the troops.
[44:13.03]We need to win this.
[44:13.79]We need the weapons.
[44:15.09]I don't want to start this over again.
[44:17.31]Alright, I'm coming.
[44:24.52]You are very far up, actually.
[44:26.38]You're not in a good place.
[44:29.13]I think I'm in a different place on my screen than on your screen.
[44:31.74]Did I just teleport?
[44:32.74]Yeah, you did.
[44:34.18]Where are the green boxes?
[44:38.86]Bullshit.
[44:39.86]Alright, watch out.
[44:43.23]Here come the grenades.
[44:49.25]These things take a while to detonate unless you throw them in front of your face.
[44:53.68]Which is kind of bullshit in its own way.
[44:58.29]Just fly up in the air and shoot super bombs.
[45:02.01]This will be worth it.
[45:04.11]Watch out to your left.
[45:06.67]Good.
[45:11.09]I am Iron Man!
[45:12.83]Take out this bridge in front of us.
[45:14.37]This overpass thing.
[45:15.50]Just get rid of this.
[45:16.38]Can we just knock this down?
[45:17.44]Okay, good.
[45:19.90]Nothing is just getting in the way.
[45:21.94]Dead.
[45:23.00]What?
[45:24.55]What keeps killing you?
[45:26.16]They shot the cheese puffs at me and I can't move and I have no health.
[45:29.16]I can't resurrect you.
[45:30.72]I need a health pack.
[45:34.30]Is there a health pack up there?
[45:38.26]Oh, there's a weapon pack.
[45:39.28]There's a weapon pack up there.
[45:42.77]I'm going to play this so... Watch out.
[45:46.51]Oh, two rockets and still alive?
[45:48.31]Oh, shit.
[45:50.17]Oh, God.
[45:50.95]So each ant takes three rockets to kill.
[45:53.17]Let's do mission two.
[45:55.42]You underestimated severely how bad the level 0 weapons are.
[45:58.48]I underestimated the fact that you died like four times.
[46:02.76]I didn't die.
[46:04.08]Game sucks.
[46:07.88]Oh, yeah?
[46:08.28]Well... Ha ha ha.
[46:14.50]Fine, we'll do the first mission.
[46:18.56]Whoa, no, I don't want to open up my Steam menu.
[46:23.62]Preparation complete.
[46:24.86]No.
[46:24.92]Select mission.
[46:26.86]Fine.
[46:27.06]Here you go.
[46:27.86]There we go.
[46:28.58]We're in the first mission.
[46:30.32]A star can't fucking handle the heat.
[46:33.36]You better get out of the fucking kitchen.
[46:34.58]You know what I'm saying?
[46:41.44]You gonna stay on fencer?
[46:42.20]Hold on.
[46:43.92]I might try the... No.
[46:46.24]Fuck him.
[46:49.18]It's only gonna get harder.
[46:50.04]We need to make sure we pick the characters we want to play with.
[46:55.22]Try the steam controller.
[46:57.80]That might not be terrible.
[47:02.89]Hard difficulty ramps up.
[47:04.27]The difficulty is so hard after a little bit.
[47:06.33]Oh, God.
[47:08.93]I think we'll be fine, though.
[47:09.83]As long as we get items.
[47:12.06]I'm just going to be air diver for life.
[47:14.90]What?
[47:16.02]Why are we doing the first mission, then?
[47:19.20]Let's just rush you through it and get you an item.
[47:23.82]Jeremy, you're acting like a fucking wheelbarrow today.
[47:26.38]I agree.
[47:28.68]What does that mean?
[47:31.61]It means I'm just sticking shit in you and pushing you around, and you're letting me do it.
[47:35.49]Okay.
[47:39.21]All right, well, you're going to have to be the carry here.
[47:47.39]Yes, that's why it's called hard.
[47:49.49]No, I want to play on hard.
[47:51.19]I don't want to play on easy mode.
[47:53.13]It's more fun that way.
[47:55.85]What a wheelbarrow streamer.
[47:58.74]Mods, do me a quick favor and ban for life people that say wheelbarrow streamer.
[48:04.00]Because I don't like that tone at all.
[48:08.60]It's making me feel inferior.
[48:10.94]Inadequate?
[48:11.56]Inferior.
[48:15.75]No one's ever called me that, and I'm a pretty bad streamer.
[48:17.63]Yeah, no one's ever called him that.
[48:19.33]Gonna call me that?
[48:21.66]No, I wanna be called... Good stream, dude!
[48:28.42]Oh my god.
[48:29.62]Okay, now this gun is awesome.
[48:32.02]The rapier?
[48:34.29]It's like a level 20 rapier.
[48:36.11]Yeah.
[48:37.37]You gotta be really close for it, though.
[48:39.65]Okay, he's dead.
[48:41.79]Well, this one's doing... It's making, like...
[48:46.61]You know that sound in Source when you're stuck in a wall and it just keeps hitting things way too many times or something?
[48:53.08]Yeah.
[48:55.64]I do.
[48:55.74]Help me.
[48:58.52]You're just clearing things.
[48:59.80]No green boxes, though.
[49:02.46]Behind me, behind me.
[49:03.14]Please, help me.
[49:04.78]I'm going to get scooped up.
[49:06.21]Oh, wow.
[49:06.89]Does that even hurt me?
[49:07.63]Yeah, I think it does.
[49:10.31]Do you ever get any upgrades that are, like, not just weapons?
[49:12.39]Help me, help me, help me, help me.
[49:20.79]Okay, that was some Garry's Mod level fucking cartwheels there, okay?
[49:26.13]Somebody had those thrusters on my back in Garry's Mod.
[49:29.59]That's what just happened.
[49:31.75]Okay.
[49:40.29]Why does this game put a million screaming civilians in the way?
[49:43.82]That is kind of annoying.
[49:45.22]That's why I turned the voice down.
[49:46.16]That makes it better.
[49:47.76]No, after a while... Well, not the screaming.
[49:49.42]That's what I'm saying.
[49:51.52]The people is fine, but the fact that they all go like this... It's like, okay.
[49:58.16]No, that was way more annoying.
[50:00.29]No, it wasn't.
[50:01.27]Listen.
[50:05.15]That's all I hear.
[50:08.23]It's the same lady screaming.
[50:11.18]Rocket jump?
[50:12.86]Don't tell me to do that.
[50:13.72]That sounds dangerous.
[50:14.74]I was about to just try it.
[50:16.27]And I was like, no, wait a second.
[50:17.97]They're just jerking my chain.
[50:21.77]Also, isn't this level different than what the first level was for the first time we played it?
[50:28.74]Did we get RNG'd?
[50:31.08]I don't know.
[50:33.30]Take out this bridge.
[50:34.68]It's causing me distress.
[50:38.14]What's with you and bridges?
[50:39.74]They're in the way.
[50:40.74]We can knock them down.
[50:41.42]There's a better line of sight over here.
[50:43.98]No green boxes.
[50:49.08]Is there a way to increase the chances of a green box to show up?
[50:57.10]Ooh, got him.
[51:00.12]Come on.
[51:00.42]There's got to be a box somewhere.
[51:01.54]Can you see anything?
[51:02.16]Nope.
[51:04.94]Yeah.
[51:08.18]No.
[51:09.20]Just a couple of these dumb things.
[51:13.57]If I even got one upgrade.
[51:14.91]God, this is so slow.
[51:17.09]Where's my booster?
[51:18.33]Oh, no.
[51:18.59]Yeah.
[51:19.03]This is the same area.
[51:23.51]Millions in property damage.
[51:24.78]Well, it's hard to say.
[51:28.84]We're being invaded by an alien race.
[51:31.42]And there's millions of ants.
[51:33.04]A couple of buildings are going to have to come down.
[51:35.76]I'm going to die.
[51:36.42]I'm going to die.
[51:36.78]What do you mean you're going to die?
[51:38.95]One of them grabbed me.
[51:40.29]You can go way faster than I can.
[51:42.01]You're way ahead of me.
[51:43.25]Well, I'm getting green boxes for you.
[51:46.09]Oh, green boxes?
[51:53.55]All I see are red boxes.
[51:55.03]Really?
[51:55.31]I... Yeah.
[52:03.25]All I see are red boxes.
[52:04.49]No greens.
[52:06.41]Maybe you can't carry me.
[52:07.03]Well, I picked them up for you.
[52:09.28]I've already gotten you, Greenbuck.
[52:11.25]Just fucking listen when your dad talks.
[52:17.45]Go in the air again.
[52:26.73]No, I was going to try, but no.
[52:28.59]We're like at the end here.
[52:29.55]I am going to throw grenades, though.
[52:31.91]And you're in somebody's mouth.
[52:36.19]Are you all right?
[52:40.77]You're okay, right?
[52:41.21]Oh my goodness.
[52:42.09]Yeah.
[52:43.01]You're, like, kind of in the middle of so many of these right now.
[52:47.32]They're swarming below me like the Hydral Scourge thing.
[52:51.02]God, yes they are.
[52:52.96]Oh.
[52:54.78]Oh.
[52:57.70]Oh.
[52:58.94]They're kind of everywhere right now, in every direction.
[53:01.81]And I don't want to blow myself up with a fucking g-g-g-gaga.
[53:08.91]Am I okay?
[53:09.55]I think I'm alright.
[53:10.15]Yes.
[53:10.37]I'm fine.
[53:18.07]What was that?
[53:18.55]I love how you're using the ring in your ears gun.
[53:29.96]Oh, green boxes.
[53:31.04]I see them.
[53:34.12]I'm going for it.
[53:34.74]Got one.
[53:36.66]Okey-dokey.
[53:38.08]Yeah, let's hope one of those is a new rocket launcher rapid-fire Don't die we're not gonna die there's only like three ants left wait wait what oh?
[53:53.53]Get that green box You get it you got it yeah all right come on give me some new shit
[54:04.90]Oh, man.
[54:06.36]All right.
[54:07.36]Grenade launcher, fusion blaster, AF-16, reverse gun.
[54:11.43]That's what I'm talking about.
[54:13.13]You play the first mission one time, and your power, like, six tuples.
[54:19.25]Okay, I'm looking at the chat right now, and I was just freaked out because I never wrote that shit.
[54:25.01]And I don't, like, I was like, when did I write ha, ha, ha?
[54:28.75]I didn't.
[54:29.05]All right, ranger.
[54:30.90]Ranger.
[54:32.55]Stingray.
[54:34.19]Grenades, grenade launcher.
[54:36.79]High rate of fire, launches successive grenades with incredible speed.
[54:41.77]What is a reverse gun?
[54:45.11]A piece of equipment that launches a special capsule full of nanomachines.
[54:49.16]On impact, the capsule bursts and spreads the nanomachines across the area where they repair friendly armor and vehicles.
[54:57.00]Okay.
[54:57.70]So, if you wanted to play the tank guy, I guess I could be battlefield support on you.
[55:05.01]Wait, what do you do?
[55:06.17]It, like, heals tanks in vehicles.
[55:08.09]Oh, who cares?
[55:08.79]I'm gonna fly.
[55:10.03]Well, the only thing I really got of value was the grenade launcher, then.
[55:14.99]Wait, fusion blaster?
[55:17.38]AF-16, the better one.
[55:20.84]What's a fusion blaster?
[55:21.84]Let's try this one.
[55:24.64]All right.
[55:25.40]Cool.
[55:25.60]Adjust the armor maximum.
[55:29.68]Ooh.
[55:30.08]All right.
[55:30.80]Let's go to the mission we were at before.
[55:33.12]Setting sun.
[55:35.16]I remember the first time we held hands.
[55:39.34]Reverse wheelbarrow.
[55:43.26]All right.
[55:46.63]I'm ready.
[55:49.64]Well, I appreciate that, Redhead.
[55:50.64]I also appreciate the fact that you're just here watching.
[55:52.74]Monetary contributions are one thing, but just being here hanging out is a huge thing.
[55:55.16]So thanks.
[55:55.40]I can't play this.
[55:55.92]I have a deep bridgeophobia.
[55:57.52]I'm starting to live just under a bridge.
[56:20.39]What's happening?
[56:20.83]What am I doing?
[56:22.17]What am I doing?
[56:22.59]The bridge!
[56:23.57]Why was that happening?
[56:24.25]Uh, I'd expected you to have walked forward by then, I assume.
[56:27.93]No, no, dude, it like sucked me into the- THERE'S GIANT SPIDERS!
[56:30.26]Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was- SPIDERS?!
[56:33.52]There was a cutscene and it was zooming in on them, but I expected you to not- Oh, this game just- Holy shit, this- Oh, this game just got, as Jorm would say, inherently better.
[56:47.05]It did!
[56:47.51]Look at this!
[56:49.23]Does that phrase make sense?
[56:50.83]I don't know.
[56:51.93]I do not have the weapons to fight these.
[56:55.47]Spiders!
[56:56.07]Nice voice crack.
[56:58.55]This is inherently better.
[56:59.41]Oh, this is inherently better.
[57:00.89]Spiders!
[57:04.16]Now what is this, plasma blaster?
[57:09.50]Get out of there!
[57:11.60]Get out of there!
[57:12.56]What is in there?
[57:13.88]Why is there a bad guy you?
[57:16.94]Oh no, that's a good guy you.
[57:17.86]That's a good guy you.
[57:21.27]It's a good guy here.
[57:22.71]Watch out, don't get sucked in by the spider web.
[57:26.13]I think that fusion blaster might be better.
[57:31.33]I inherited that spider.
[57:32.49]I can't stop shooting this, by the way.
[57:33.67]It won't stop.
[57:36.20]I have to switch guns for that to stop shooting.
[57:37.76]Alright, that's how many more spiders?
[57:45.14]That's so cool.
[57:46.02]Dude, this game just got inherently better.
[57:53.50]I love this rapid fire fireworks gun.
[57:55.86]This is great.
[57:59.89]Dude, you see that one?
[58:03.79]They can't really do much to us from down here.
[58:05.35]I flew into the web help.
[58:07.86]What?
[58:08.84]I'm dying.
[58:13.92]That was the plan.
[58:14.38]The plan was to shoot you down.
[58:19.17]Yeah, I think it worked.
[58:22.78]No, it's inherently more shattish-fying.
[58:25.60]These guys take a lot of hits.
[58:33.30]Oh, I'm getting pulled into another web.
[58:35.05]What?
[58:35.97]This is getting inherently more scary.
[58:39.65]Just proton beam him.
[58:43.07]Shit, I wish I could turn it off.
[58:44.65]It doesn't stop shooting.
[58:47.49]Slowly but surely, don't do anything.
[58:48.87]Wait, wait, we gotta pick up stuff, don't we?
[58:52.40]Bigger spiders, bigger scary.
[58:53.54]I can't wait till we get the giant, huge spider for the boss.
[58:56.56]Oh, the towers.
[58:58.70]Huh?
[59:01.47]Are you stuck?
[59:02.19]No.
[59:03.17]Yeah, there's only like a few more.
[59:08.39]I haven't seen a single green box.
[59:11.95]And I don't even have like a long range weapon to shoot these guys.
[59:15.77]I do.
[59:16.73]I have spread launcher and shotgun.
[59:21.33]Can we take out the actual webs?
[59:23.57]Can that web fall?
[59:24.45]Yes.
[59:26.45]You know how our people were stuck in the webs?
[59:28.69]I mean, like, the whole web can be shot down, is what you're saying.
[59:30.77]Yeah.
[59:33.60]Oh, he's coming down.
[59:38.94]Cool.
[59:39.28]I think I'm close enough with this.
[59:41.04]I am.
[59:41.20]I'm going to burn him.
[59:43.36]Oh, did he drop?
[59:43.92]Nope.
[59:45.46]Although I am going to get that health, or you are, because you're faster than me.
[59:51.00]People are saying the green dots on the mini maps are the items That would make a lot of sense would make a lot of sense.
[59:57.38]Thank you chat for helping us play through this video game I Feel like don't fucking backseat game.
[60:04.74]You know what I'm talking about You should be the designated collector of those things because you can fly I'm going to some of the green dots.
[60:16.14]I mean, they're not all weapons.
[60:17.28]I
[60:20.43]Hey, there's one.
[60:21.81]Yeah, no, this is definitely... They're right.
[60:24.49]This is a weapon rider spell.
[60:27.93]And then the stream cuts to a gorilla in a car crash.
[60:34.29]Wow, that mission was inherently short.
[60:35.79]It wasn't that shattish flying.
[60:37.17]But they were just introducing us to a new enemy.
[60:39.23]The buzzy bee spider.
[60:42.26]Mmm.
[60:44.62]Wideshot.
[60:45.22]Okay.
[60:46.60]What was that?
[60:51.13]I don't think I like the grenade launcher very much.
[60:52.73]It's a shotgun.
[60:56.77]Special shotgun scatters rounds over a horizontal arc, making it extremely effective against enemy groups.
[61:03.55]Must be careful not to catch your fellow soldiers in the line of fire.
[61:06.90]Okay.
[61:08.92]I like the fusion blaster.
[61:09.78]It does... It does a lot of good.
[61:14.48]Alright, you ready?
[61:16.62]Yep.
[61:17.14]Windshear.
[61:20.36]Wait, wait, wait.
[61:21.96]Didn't we just do this?
[61:25.22]No.
[61:25.86]Yeah, we did.
[61:27.90]We just did sunsets.
[61:28.88]Did we?
[61:29.28]Okay.
[61:29.82]Maybe I'm just seeing the thumbnail and thinking we already did it.
[61:33.06]Yeah, it's clickbait.
[61:35.98]How fast do you think I can fucking drink this?
[61:41.20]Two seconds?
[61:41.54]Patiently.
[61:42.32]Patiently over the next 15 minutes.
[61:44.33]Okay.
[61:50.19]Thanks for that.
[61:52.17]All right, wide shot!
[61:56.63]That is a really wide shot, actually.
[61:58.49]This takes a long time to reload, too.
[62:02.03]Wait, what?
[62:04.81]I didn't see this coming.
[62:08.51]Oh, no, what is it?
[62:09.11]Is it a spider?
[62:09.95]Is that the giggle gun?
[62:11.13]What is that thing?
[62:14.44]Dude, I'm a toddler, and that's my, like, toy firetruck.
[62:22.98]Yeah, it's not always a weapon.
[62:25.08]But that's where the items are.
[62:31.88]I think that might have been a person that was there, by the way, that was making that noise.
[62:38.85]God, I wish I had a... I need to travel to get, like, a travel item or something.
[62:41.61]This is horrible.
[62:44.71]What is making that noise?
[62:47.54]That's not your gun.
[62:49.26]No.
[62:49.42]I don't know what it is.
[62:55.84]Yeah, that's a shitty wind-up ambulance.
[63:00.66]I guess they just weren't close to here.
[63:02.82]They're doing a combo on us.
[63:04.29]Ants too.
[63:06.17]Ant combo.
[63:11.51]Watch out!
[63:14.35]Shotgun is kind of good.
[63:16.51]It's kind of good ripping these webs apart I Am I am ripping them apart so satisfying to just get in there and do that much damage I'm done with that now by the way, but The satisfying thing is a weapon got it Guys on the way get out of the way god, that's so satisfying That's a full heel
[63:46.31]The one bad thing about this weapon is I can't turn it off.
[63:49.99]Oh, that's a broken up car.
[63:52.75]Anything else?
[63:53.17]Any other items we missed?
[63:54.79]No?
[63:57.84]No, I'm caught in the... One more shot.
[64:10.09]Blaster.
[64:12.21]Whoa, almost got me there.
[64:13.25]Almost snuck up on me, didn't you?
[64:14.77]What?
[64:16.08]Ooh.
[64:16.56]Where are you?
[64:18.44]I don't want to split up.
[64:22.52]I don't want to split up too much.
[64:24.71]We'll become a giant insect planet.
[64:29.13]I have my volume turned down.
[64:32.06]Every once in a while I can hear them talking.
[64:33.62]I like it.
[64:37.57]Just get fucking blasted.
[64:40.00]I love how that pushes them.
[64:40.82]It's great.
[64:42.36]Those ragdolls.
[64:44.92]They are crazy.
[64:48.08]Here comes the little kid's wind-up toy again.
[64:49.74]Might be a weapon some of the ADF is using.
[65:01.17]Any more green boxes?
[65:05.45]Oh shit!
[65:07.41]Help me!
[65:08.05]Help me!
[65:10.93]I'm coming to you!
[65:11.64]I just walked in with the laser grid.
[65:15.92]I didn't even understand what was happening.
[65:17.64]Okay, well that was fun.
[65:23.10]Save me!
[65:23.96]Save me!
[65:24.41]Save me!
[65:24.77]Save me!
[65:25.31]Save me!
[65:28.89]I'm not really going to be useful anymore.
[65:31.75]It's pretty much up to you.
[65:32.89]I don't have any more of my gun.
[65:34.45]That's good.
[65:37.30]You don't have infinite ammo?
[65:39.42]Not on that weapon.
[65:40.02]Apparently not.
[65:45.06]Yeah, I can't reload it.
[65:47.98]They're making Atari noises.
[65:55.04]I think that's it after this, right?
[65:56.44]Any green boxes we missed?
[65:58.67]What's the green R?
[65:59.73]Oh, the R is you.
[66:01.31]The green what?
[66:03.17]The R on my map is you.
[66:05.12]My weapons suck.
[66:05.88]No, they don't.
[66:08.11]The blaster is awesome.
[66:10.99]The blaster is amazing.
[66:12.19]It just can't be turned off.
[66:17.13]Hey, thanks for bowling that into me.
[66:18.85]That was good.
[66:26.84]Flying insects, I guess.
[66:34.00]Okay.
[66:35.24]You ready for probably a boss?
[66:36.48]Are you ready for some loot?
[66:42.00]Those are some big spooters.
[66:45.05]Slugshot.
[66:47.37]Okay.
[66:47.85]Probably another shotgun.
[66:50.13]Underground cave.
[66:51.35]A giant insect nest is spread out under the city.
[66:53.94]Alright.
[66:55.94]Class and equipment.
[66:57.66]Wideshot versus slugshot.
[67:01.56]Okay, this one is every half second.
[67:04.02]450.
[67:04.66]This is 22 times 20.
[67:05.73]4 second reload.
[67:08.27]Range 50.
[67:08.75]I got an A+.
[67:11.39]Okay, so this is a lot lower range, but it's not a huge spread.
[67:21.12]It just does a flat 450 damage.
[67:23.34]I'll try it.
[67:23.82]We'll give it a go.
[67:24.36]Okay.
[67:26.82]What about this?
[67:27.54]The AF-16.
[67:28.52]I'll do that.
[67:30.56]Ready to go to church?
[67:32.34]I am.
[67:32.58]I'm not satisfied enough.
[67:37.02]I need a Snickers.
[67:38.62]You need a Snickers?
[67:40.25]Yeah.
[67:40.77]Use the slug shot?
[67:41.45]I'm definitely going to use the slug shot.
[67:42.73]Why wouldn't I?
[67:48.33]Grinding inferno difficulty is by far the best way to get good guns.
[67:51.45]It's hard though, says Corporal Small.
[67:54.31]Oh shit, we're actually underground.
[67:55.69]This is kind of scary now.
[67:56.99]What are you doing?
[68:11.30]Sorry, I had to increase the volume a little bit.
[68:16.60]Only five shots and that's a long reload too.
[68:20.23]Holy shoot.
[68:25.35]Sick Resident Evil 5 mission here.
[68:30.19]What's the rate of fire on this?
[68:31.49]That's pretty good.
[68:35.45]Where are they?
[68:38.31]How come I don't see any enemies?
[68:39.37]Because you're blind.
[68:42.65]Alright, good job guys.
[68:43.85]You did it.
[68:45.50]I did it.
[68:45.98]I'm a god.
[68:49.95]Slugshot.
[68:52.03]He's so much faster than me.
[68:53.65]Give me my fucking rocket shoes.
[68:54.89]Can I get rollerblades?
[68:56.45]Bye.
[68:57.49]Give me my rollerblades.
[68:58.55]This is not fair.
[68:59.05]I don't want you to see an ant this mission.
[69:01.75]No, this is a cool place.
[69:02.99]God damn it.
[69:04.53]You are so far ahead.
[69:07.55]I'm going to get you killed though.
[69:22.15]Please don't do that when I'm standing underneath you.
[69:25.65]Please don't stand underneath me.
[69:27.41]Where do you want me to stand?
[69:28.85]You got a better place for me to go?
[69:30.59]Just go wait and spawn.
[69:32.48]Fucking wheelbarrow streamer.
[69:38.78]Weapon!
[69:41.08]Got it, that helped.
[69:42.60]I kind of like the machine gun, even though it sucks.
[69:47.88]I like it.
[69:48.20]The slugshot is too long to reload and it's one big...
[69:51.58]Oh boy, this is kind of scary.
[69:55.54]Keep rolling.
[69:59.62]What does Q do?
[70:00.56]It does like a marker or something?
[70:01.71]I guess it's just like, look over there.
[70:09.65]What is that?
[70:10.13]Do you hear those people singing?
[70:14.68]No.
[70:15.46]You did not hear that chorus just sing.
[70:17.64]No.
[70:18.08]Okay.
[70:19.00]That was weird.
[70:22.58]You are just lighting up this whole cavern.
[70:26.60]Oh cool, you're doing this dazzling laser light show and killing all these ants.
[70:37.97]I'm gonna die.
[70:40.44]So you don't die.
[70:42.52]I may have overextended.
[70:44.82]Overextended?
[70:45.42]You're like all the way back there.
[70:52.46]I will say you're making a pretty cool fraggle rock down this corridor.
[70:57.54]And thank you for hurting everyone.
[70:59.26]You're just killing all of us.
[71:02.56]You're orbital striking down this hallway and it's killing all of us.
[71:05.56]I have 72 HP now.
[71:16.14]You don't get anything.
[71:22.11]Go to the chat menu and sing?
[71:23.59]Why are they all shooting a wall?
[71:32.78]What are they doing?
[71:33.34]Somebody said you can do it in the chat menu.
[71:36.78]They're all shooting the wall.
[71:51.83]He's screaming, just dancing.
[71:56.37]What are these guys doing?
[71:57.43]There's ants behind the wall.
[71:59.61]Oh shit, oh god, okay.
[72:04.74]What a fucking awful soldier.
[72:07.84]Oh my god, I'm dying.
[72:09.28]You see these moves?
[72:13.54]Oh, these things are fucking terrible.
[72:14.82]I am actually scared of these things, I'm not kidding.
[72:18.06]This is like fucking seriously tapping into some type of fear right now.
[72:21.41]I don't like these at all.
[72:22.73]I don't like these.
[72:23.67]I really don't.
[72:26.25]They're too real looking.
[72:29.61]They have like that spider face.
[72:32.21]You ever get real close to a spider and you see its face?
[72:35.53]Yeah, right now.
[72:37.36]I'm in deep shit here.
[72:41.26]Where are you?
[72:46.34]This thing sucks.
[72:55.81]Jumping spiders are cute.
[72:56.93]They're terrifying, man.
[72:59.74]Because even if you're not trying to, like, swat them... We're both very close to dying.
[73:03.84]Yeah, we are.
[73:04.36]Just stay back.
[73:06.54]I'm not going to be able to resurrect you if you... Yeah.
[73:09.04]Me either.
[73:10.34]I think all of our friends are going to die.
[73:14.10]This is not a good weapon combination.
[73:15.34]I don't like this thing.
[73:16.00]This lug shot's not good.
[73:17.90]I wish I didn't have the destroy the walls to the left and right of me gun.
[73:25.47]Hope nobody has a phobia.
[73:26.51]It's kind of tapping into mine.
[73:27.79]I don't have a real bad spider phobia, but... Talking about these guys' faces are seriously freaking me out.
[73:42.32]Careful.
[73:43.50]That's not wise to be down there.
[73:46.42]That is unwise.
[73:56.74]There is a big health kit I died inside of, around the corner.
[74:00.84]Is it still there, or did you die?
[74:02.22]Yep, still got it.
[74:03.35]Is it going to be really risky?
[74:04.33]I can't do it right now.
[74:11.07]I think I can get it.
[74:11.95]There's one spider here.
[74:20.82]Go, don't shoot me, guy.
[74:22.04]Alright, where are you?
[74:25.42]I don't know.
[74:26.08]Oh, you're right there.
[74:26.86]I just want to get that other health back.
[74:29.08]Come back to me!
[74:29.94]You spawned right in front of one.
[74:32.42]We're on top.
[74:33.67]Oh, jeez.
[74:34.49]Whoa!
[74:37.91]What happened?
[74:40.95]We both instantly died.
[74:41.93]I don't know.
[74:44.09]Like four spiders ran around the corner and just... Their webs hurt you, so... I don't like these weapons.
[74:50.34]I'm going to change these weapons.
[74:51.16]Me either.
[74:57.29]Oh yeah, I resurrected you and then it was just dead.
[75:03.61]Okay, let's change that out.
[75:11.32]I don't like this lug shot.
[75:12.22]I'd rather take this thing.
[75:13.84]The fusion blaster does way more damage.
[75:15.84]It's just more reliable.
[75:16.68]These guns kind of suck.
[75:24.55]I'll take the wide shot over the slug shot any day of the week, you know what I mean?
[75:29.83]Be a fast guy out here.
[75:31.54]I want to get some weapons for the ranger.
[75:35.14]We'll be fine.
[75:36.00]I'm shooting walls more than I'm shooting them.
[75:38.94]And then again, I can't get close to those spiders, but only have pretty much a shotgun.
[75:42.30]Right.
[75:46.24]Okay, hold on.
[75:46.90]Don't move for a second.
[75:53.22]I'm moving.
[75:54.08]I'm moving.
[75:57.07]Go to shout and go to sing.
[76:01.53]And there's also scream.
[76:08.49]What button?
[76:11.58]It's just you hit the arrow keys up.
[76:17.22]It's like the voice lines are so low and the game sounds... It's cool, but...
[76:22.44]Not cool enough.
[76:23.44]Because I have to actually raise the volume on it.
[76:26.92]I like the dancing better.
[76:27.90]The dancing is more fun.
[76:29.21]Okay, this grenade launcher blows up, like, a lot.
[76:33.33]But I can actually aim it.
[76:35.45]I'm dead.
[76:38.81]Whoa!
[76:39.19]Why?
[76:39.59]What hit me?
[76:40.09]Why did you die that fast?
[76:43.31]It looked like a steel girder whipped out of the wall and hit me in the back.
[76:46.90]You did?
[76:49.31]Okay, on my screen, you were doing the scream emote.
[76:53.71]And I thought you just did the scream emote.
[76:55.67]You died this time.
[76:56.63]I thought it killed you if you did it too many times.
[77:01.85]If you scream too many times, it kills you.
[77:06.92]Well, now we both have half health.
[77:08.26]This is not going to go well.
[77:10.74]Sing with the squad.
[77:11.70]Call for depth crawlers to support the assault unit.
[77:19.94]They're not doing it!
[77:22.82]Where are my squad members?
[77:25.21]This weapon is awesome, but I think I killed most of our squad.
[77:29.29]Is that what happened?
[77:30.69]Yeah.
[77:34.51]It was seriously just... I gotta hold on to that thing.
[77:39.10]That thing is so strong, but not on these shitty grey ants.
[77:44.18]That's not a good idea.
[77:47.76]When we get into some trouble is when I pulled out that big Larry, you know what I mean?
[77:59.20]So many giant insects.
[78:00.92]They need a better term than giant insects.
[78:03.36]You want to get one of these health packs, please?
[78:07.13]Where?
[78:08.99]Before you make me concerned, because here come the scary real-life bugs.
[78:13.13]No, not yet.
[78:21.40]That character is so much more fun than one that you're playing.
[78:24.96]Yeah.
[78:27.14]I hope eventually I get some really cool weapon to make me being as slow as I am worth it.
[78:34.81]I know what I'm saying.
[78:35.65]I'm going the wrong way, but I was curious what was over here.
[78:40.13]Nothing over here?
[78:40.59]There's not like a shortcut or anything?
[78:45.23]Are you sure?
[78:46.92]I don't know.
[78:48.28]It might be, but... Earth Defense Force.
[78:55.24]Alright, I've made it.
[79:02.45]I just inhaled a burger, some fries, and a milkshake, and I'm regretting it.
[79:05.85]How would you regret that?
[79:06.87]That sounds like... That sounds like a great Friday night to me.
[79:15.54]This thing kind of fills the whole hallway, that's why I like it.
[79:17.96]Alright, I'm bringing the big gun out.
[79:25.97]What's behind us?
[79:28.65]Ragdolls of ants.
[79:35.13]Sometimes you just need the right tool for the job.
[79:38.41]Food's not meant to go in your lungs.
[79:42.21]No, it is not.
[79:43.71]It's not meant to go inside your lungs.
[79:45.21]You're right.
[79:48.74]This is where we got to last time.
[79:56.10]No, not quite.
[79:56.82]Let's get this health.
[80:00.50]I can spot the health packs for you.
[80:03.35]That's good.
[80:08.14]Come get the health pack.
[80:10.96]I'm helping when I can pull out this gun, but I can only use it for a little while.
[80:16.55]Here come the fucking scary ants.
[80:17.81]Should we let them feed down the hall like we did last time?
[80:33.70]I hate when they say giant insects.
[80:36.00]Why?
[80:37.14]The amount of giant insects is more than we can handle.
[80:42.52]Just call them fucking bugs.
[80:45.17]Yeah, I'm going for it.
[80:45.99]I'm gonna aim it down the hall and just burn the fuck out of everyone that comes down it.
[80:49.95]Oh, I'm... I overexerted myself.
[80:57.60]Watch out, Jeremy.
[80:58.60]There's a giant bug to your six o'clock.
[81:00.32]Don't use my fucking real name!
[81:03.10]It's German95, dude!
[81:05.78]Don't use my fucking name, man!
[81:07.76]We got any germs in the chat, guys?
[81:09.44]Watch out!
[81:09.96]I killed myself.
[81:11.06]What are you doing?
[81:13.24]Why?
[81:14.06]Friends me.
[81:14.52]Give me a second.
[81:20.24]That guy said I was doing great.
[81:25.89]Well, look what you've done.
[81:30.46]Look what you've done.
[81:32.14]What have I done?
[81:33.52]You caused them all to be able to get through.
[81:34.92]That's fine, because I can just stand back here and bomb them.
[81:38.03]I'm gonna cover the right, you cover the left door, okay?
[81:41.81]That doesn't work, because they're like on top of these pillars.
[81:45.01]It does work.
[81:45.49]It works, you just have to have faith.
[81:59.93]Dude, you just dropped a fucking missile on me.
[82:02.59]Watch your six, man.
[82:05.05]Sacrifices must be made.
[82:07.01]No, it's called you dropping bombs on top of my head, and now I have six.
[82:11.99]I'm gonna die.
[82:13.95]I'm gonna die because you just are so negligent in how you're aiming that weapon.
[82:19.78]Whatever, I don't see you doing anything.
[82:21.78]I was doing lots.
[82:23.64]But it's all you now.
[82:25.30]I'm out of my cool weapon and I can't go up there because you're going to rain plasma bombs on me.
[82:30.28]I'm done using it.
[82:31.37]Yeah, right, liar.
[82:35.03]Okay, they're back to shooting the wall.
[82:37.25]I'll kill you!
[82:38.11]Alright, this is health.
[82:39.23]I'm getting it.
[82:40.17]Cover me, please.
[82:47.30]I rolled by it.
[82:47.92]It's okay.
[82:51.41]Come on, Styr.
[82:52.07]Ah, fuck.
[82:56.49]Where is it coming from?
[82:57.49]There's only a few left.
[83:01.55]I feel like this is the end of the mission here.
[83:03.03]Could be.
[83:05.18]You're kind of going way far away.
[83:06.88]There's one guy over here.
[83:10.94]Would you rather run over here and do it?
[83:12.92]No, I guess there's a couple here.
[83:15.00]I'm too scared.
[83:15.96]There's a health pack right there, but I'm not confident to go get it.
[83:18.44]I can res you.
[83:22.98]There's only two left.
[83:23.60]Is that it?
[83:32.21]Did we win?
[83:38.33]Please get out of the way.
[83:42.20]Thank god.
[83:43.38]I guess we could have gone down that path.
[83:46.12]I just got exposed.
[83:49.50]Stop exposing me!
[83:53.07]Ooh, ME3 Emerald level 15.
[83:55.80]Ooh.
[83:58.28]Let's see what that is.
[84:02.85]Mute, you're being so loud right now.
[84:09.53]Okay, what is it called?
[84:11.00]Emmy Emerald.
[84:11.60]Okay.
[84:12.04]Damage 260.
[84:13.34]1.5 second.
[84:13.58]Reload.
[84:14.30]Powered up Emerald Missile Launcher that allows for locking onto three targets at once if so desired.
[84:19.94]It's destructive power and lock-on distance are so satisfying.
[84:23.76]Put it on.
[84:27.95]Alright.
[84:29.51]This one is Eruption.
[84:37.56]And while we have a second here, I'm going to say thank you to Yabby11, thanks for the sub.
[84:42.61]Farrakus227 for two months, thanks.
[84:44.55]AnalGoblin for four months.
[84:46.81]GiantBugs, where's the giant rat?
[84:49.17]This is a bug game, man.
[84:51.13]ParagonSheep, thanks for four months.
[84:52.57]BingleJilly, thanks for four months as well.
[84:55.35]Sigil, thanks for the sub.
[84:56.90]UniWuskiDemoMan.
[84:58.98]MrMcSister.
[85:01.62]You know the rest.
[85:02.58]I'm not going to say that out loud, but thank you.
[85:06.09]Suicidal Spree, thanks for three months, ya boi pug, Trish, Krish312, Zombieman4, Bizcasual, Oscar Trek, and we're losing.
[85:14.82]I don't like these guys at all.
[85:16.44]What happened?
[85:23.68]Wow, this gun's cool.
[85:24.56]I like this gun a lot.
[85:28.19]I don't even have to play the game.
[85:29.13]This is fucking the best gun in the game.
[85:32.01]What is it?
[85:33.03]The gun where it just does it for you.
[85:34.45]You don't even have to play the game.
[85:40.02]It's the auto-lock-on gun.
[85:46.32]This thing is amazing.
[85:48.83]Alright, we're bringing this thing out right now.
[85:56.71]We gotta get some damage here.
[86:09.93]The triple black box?
[86:11.95]It kind of does look like that.
[86:13.19]You're right.
[86:14.93]Wow, that hurts.
[86:16.19]Was that you that shot me?
[86:17.21]I think it was.
[86:18.59]Might have been.
[86:23.79]He plays for you.
[86:30.08]One more.
[86:31.26]Where are you?
[86:33.40]Hey, do you see any green boxes?
[86:40.07]How's your health?
[86:40.55]Is it full health back right now?
[86:42.93]Or a big one?
[86:43.29]I'm saying full for some reason.
[86:44.71]Hey, you want to pick up these red boxes.
[86:47.07]Yeah?
[86:47.35]Because they give you more armor.
[86:48.85]Yeah.
[86:48.99]That you can go to the next mission with.
[86:50.93]I've been picking them up as I see them.
[86:53.47]Okay, it seemed like you were walking by like a pile of them.
[86:55.59]This is so far away.
[87:00.17]This is so far away.
[87:01.31]Where the fuck is my transport?
[87:06.04]Have fun, Star.
[87:06.72]Hope you have fun playing the game.
[87:08.24]I am.
[87:12.30]But thank you, what I was gonna say is thank you to the Fresh Breath, don't do that.
[87:16.14]Don't fucking do that!
[87:17.64]That's not a funny joke!
[87:19.15]Do you want a PvP?
[87:20.55]No, that's not a funny joke, because now we might not be able to win, because I'm the real gamer here.
[87:30.43]Thank you to Ender Roark for two months, and the Fresh Breath, and Arkham Cats.
[87:34.47]Those are the last three I believe that I missed.
[87:36.11]Thank you very much.
[87:36.93]Welcome back, and welcome to the channel!
[87:40.38]My name is Jerma985, and this is how we do on this channel.
[87:47.51]Um, the last time we played this game, we played the old game, and I hated every moment of it.
[87:51.73]Yeah.
[87:52.39]But I'm having fun.
[87:54.01]This one's fun.
[87:54.97]No, I wouldn't be playing it right now if I didn't think it was fun.
[87:59.76]Yeah, like Skate 3.
[88:01.50]No, we don't talk about Skate 3.
[88:04.13]You played that longer than this?
[88:05.19]No, we don't talk about Skate 3.
[88:06.15]Okay.
[88:07.53]That is a... What happened to that spider?
[88:11.71]That guy... We don't talk about Skate 3.
[88:17.28]I haven't played that game.
[88:19.46]What are you talking about?
[88:20.54]There's no evidence.
[88:21.22]That guy is so good.
[88:31.71]Thank you.
[88:34.88]Yeah, we played the one that came out in, like, 2010.
[88:36.34]Yeah.
[88:39.52]There's something just inherently satisfying about this game.
[88:46.20]You know, there's something just inherently satisfying about this game.
[88:49.31]It just makes it so inherently more fun.
[88:53.21]Oh, God.
[88:53.83]You got me.
[88:55.45]You got me.
[88:58.59]Yeah, I will admit, you got me.
[88:59.61]It's okay.
[89:01.74]Only old Jerma fans will remember.
[89:05.64]Can I shoot three of these, please?
[89:10.64]Where are you?
[89:11.08]Are you helping me?
[89:11.79]Help me!
[89:13.89]Am I helping?
[89:14.57]You help me.
[89:17.33]I don't like these ones.
[89:19.21]Where's my team?
[89:20.01]Yeah, I'd rather be shooting ants.
[89:23.19]They cooperate.
[89:24.64]Show of Shad is fucked.
[89:30.11]Is this gonna go around the building?
[89:31.67]No, of course not.
[89:32.29]I'm just gonna destroy a landmark.
[89:34.91]Oh god, I'm sorry.
[89:35.85]I didn't mean to do that.
[89:36.61]Are there any bullets left in this thing?
[89:40.75]Of course I don't.
[89:42.66]Where is he?
[89:46.46]Oh, fuck!
[89:50.58]I just wanted to get the one bug, not destroy it.
[89:53.49]That's gonna crash on me, isn't it?
[89:54.91]Inherently good.
[90:03.13]I love this thing.
[90:03.95]I love this thing, but I hate this thing.
[90:06.61]I'm not using it again.
[90:11.81]Where you at?
[90:13.07]Mega Meta Pizza?
[90:14.01]What's the Meta Pizza?
[90:15.65]Meta Pizza?
[90:18.25]Meta Pizza Alfredo?
[90:19.77]Why is there one guy?
[90:21.12]Oh boy, this might be lost.
[90:21.96]Wait, we left a whole bunch of boxes back there.
[90:24.20]I think there's one blip over there that looks like potentially a big scary guy, maybe.
[90:30.87]Probably just one dumb spider.
[90:32.91]When you see a mosquito in your room.
[90:35.29]Stop missing all the boxes.
[90:37.61]Look, where is it?
[90:39.07]I'm standing on top of one right now.
[90:41.55]Oh.
[90:43.09]Shut up.
[90:43.79]Hey, did I tell you that I beat Dark Souls 3 on stream that time?
[90:49.37]Remember that?
[90:50.87]I do.
[90:50.97]Yeah.
[90:51.47]Well, that spider just was more inherently easy to kill.
[90:57.44]That was inherently easy?
[91:02.00]Yeah, I have four health.
[91:08.96]I hope that's not going to fuck it up.
[91:10.24]Okay, good.
[91:12.82]What a stream barrel wheeler.
[91:14.78]Stingray M2.
[91:15.84]That's a level 20 weapon.
[91:18.58]I got the Pandora beta.
[91:20.67]I got into the beta for Pandora.
[91:22.21]What about Skate 3?
[91:23.11]We don't talk about Dark Skate 3.
[91:28.46]You guys remember when I beat Dark Skate 3?
[91:33.58]Yeah, Dark Souls 3, no summons, come on!
[91:35.80]It's hard.
[91:39.42]Alright, I get to pee really badly, so give me a minute.
[91:43.16]I just got a super weapon.
[91:44.53]I know, will you just oogle it for a few minutes?
[91:46.99]I'll be right back.
[91:49.95]Hey, I'm muted with him, but I'm still here because I want to say thanks to some people.
[91:53.49]Thanks to XtenantX for four months.
[91:54.91]Yabby11 for the new server.
[91:56.05]I'm eating a Snickers bar.
[91:57.32]He's going to interrupt me.
[91:58.14]Every time I take a bite.
[91:59.80]Never trust a purple.
[92:00.58]Thanks for 250 bits.
[92:02.06]Eight slices of Mega Matter Pizza.
[92:03.70]Stay hungry, friends.
[92:05.32]He doesn't know I'm doing this, but who cares?
[92:07.00]Thanks, Purple.
[92:08.14]Thanks to all the guys that came with the bits.
[92:10.64]You guys rock.
[92:11.84]Much love.
[92:13.06]Much love.
[92:14.17]Much love.

[92:18.15]Whatever.
[92:19.17]I'll be right back.
[92:25.09]You're not, you're like unmuted.
[92:26.39]So like if you do anything fucking dumb or you crinkle any dumb fucking bags with your hands, they're gonna hear it.
[92:31.68]And now he's muted.
[92:32.64]That's how you get muted.
[92:33.80]That's how you get muted.
[92:34.42]All right, I'll be right back.

[95:12.20]Hello?
[95:13.36]Yeah.
[95:14.22]I just peed in my pants.
[95:16.91]Did you?
[95:17.41]I was rushing back to get... Okay, so you know when, like, you go to the bathroom, and you pee, and you're done?
[95:23.07]And then you button up, you zip it up, you're ready to go?
[95:26.25]Alright, and then, like, because I'm rushing, I was fucking rushing.
[95:28.79]But you're, like, still going.
[95:29.73]You're still going, and you're zipping up, and you keep going, and you come down, and you're, like, still going.
[95:33.82]No, no, no, no, no.
[95:36.38]Like, I was rushing to get back down here, and I was, like, pissing as hard as I can, and I sat down, and, like, yeah, a little came up.
[95:42.52]Because, like, I was rushing.
[95:45.03]This- I made this story up.
[95:46.11]This isn't even real.
[95:47.17]Let's- let's fucking get back to the game, please.
[95:51.13]I made that fucking story up.
[95:52.47]Everyone thinks I'm like some kind of fucking weirdo.
[95:55.43]Made it up, guys.
[95:56.45]That's not real.
[95:59.25]Come on.
[96:00.63]Let me select my... Okay, we got a big spider.
[96:05.86]Well, I got a nuclear bomb.
[96:06.92]I made that up.
[96:07.62]I got the Pandora beta.
[96:09.56]I'm in the beta.
[96:11.26]I don't like this thing anymore.
[96:12.30]Stingray M2O.
[96:14.08]Baby boy.
[96:16.31]This is just the shitty rocket launcher, but better.
[96:19.61]Ooh, baby boy.
[96:21.81]Why am I saying baby boy?
[96:22.91]Alright, I'm good.
[96:25.77]Wait, no I'm not.
[96:30.67]233.
[96:33.88]Alright.
[96:36.00]Let's keep the EDF going.
[96:42.50]Oh yeah, okay, let's get this going.
[96:46.77]Why is this taking longer to load than the other ones?
[96:52.60]Can I see what this thing does?
[96:56.24]You dancing?
[96:58.18]What is it?
[96:59.82]Okay.
[97:00.80]Whoa!
[97:01.38]Jeez.
[97:03.04]That's not stopping.
[97:04.56]It's the thing that ruined Tribes of Send.
[97:06.48]The big ricochet grenade.
[97:10.12]That's really annoying and it's not stopping.
[97:12.40]I think you're hitting civilians.
[97:16.28]That is so annoying.
[97:17.37]I hope you're not going to be using that because it hurts my head.
[97:21.61]I'm on the damn ground while you're using it.
[97:25.64]Oh, can that hurt you?
[97:27.12]Maybe.
[97:28.36]This new rocket launcher is sick, by the way.
[97:31.90]Faster.
[97:37.00]Remember we were talking about how I wasn't very good?
[97:39.60]Yeah.
[97:40.02]Did you just get good?
[97:40.90]Not anymore.
[97:41.46]Just got good at the game.
[97:44.76]Why's that guy aiming at you?
[97:47.82]Yes, sir!
[97:49.00]The death blossom.
[97:49.86]That's what he did.
[97:50.26]That's what he's talking about.
[97:51.02]The death blossom.
[97:56.73]More big spiders.
[98:03.56]This thing is awesome.
[98:07.20]I love the blue trail too.
[98:09.78]I unlocked a new skin for it.
[98:10.97]A blue skin.
[98:15.03]This is like super loud in my head.
[98:21.39]That thing is just annoying.
[98:23.42]I thought it was going to be like a big bomb.
[98:25.02]They killed so many things right there.
[98:29.98]Yeah, that is freaking me out.
[98:30.98]I keep thinking that's an enemy fighting, shooting me.
[98:36.89]Really hope you turn off also the shots bounce like if I use that inside one of the like inside one of the tunnels That's probably where it's supposed to be used TBH Thank you for getting and putting in the game the you have a graphics card texture problem with your card.
[98:52.94]You need to replace it That's what that thing is It's not what it is it's actually the Pandora beta no it's not look it up and that that guy got in the way you saw that I
[99:05.77]Get the boxes, get the boxes.
[99:08.21]Don't forget to pick up the boxes.
[99:10.53]There's a lot of them.
[99:12.07]Why is it my job?
[99:12.71]Why don't you slowly walk at them?
[99:15.60]Can you pick these up for me too?
[99:18.56]Can you be item collection person?
[99:21.88]I'm doing more damage than the spiders.
[99:25.40]Shit, that was my kill.
[99:26.72]You stole that from me.
[99:28.36]Can we kick this guy?
[99:31.77]I wanted to see the pogchamps.
[99:32.95]I can still see the pogchamps.
[99:37.80]What?
[99:39.26]Come on.
[99:40.68]Okay, I'd like to see the pogchamps for that one.
[99:43.22]It's a fun game.
[100:01.74]I think we should dial up to harder difficulty.
[100:04.96]You want to join the Inferno?
[100:06.50]Not Inferno.
[100:07.22]It is hard and it's hardest, I think.
[100:10.96]But it's not the hardest if there's Inferno.
[100:12.80]It is Inferno.
[100:13.56]It's Diablo 3 Inferno.
[100:15.34]Well, can't you have like up to four people?
[100:18.10]Does it scale for how many people?
[100:21.19]Why is this thing so big?
[100:24.39]Is this one bigger than all the others?
[100:25.45]I think it is.
[100:25.89]Look at how big this one is.
[100:28.77]Come on, jump in the air.
[100:33.54]You stole my thunder, steer.
[100:37.28]Oh, steer.
[100:38.58]Somebody said, good luck.
[100:40.40]You're going to do hardest during the kernel.
[100:44.09]Apparently that requires the utmost skill.
[100:45.47]This is feeling...
[100:48.81]Kinda easy.
[100:50.22]There's a bunch of boxes.
[100:51.14]Two green boxes over here.
[100:54.06]Oh, I have like a kind of a showdown with this guy.
[100:58.46]Criiiiick, champ.
[101:01.22]Oh wow, I almost got there before you.
[101:03.14]And I came from like two streets away.
[101:07.52]How can you get to play the fight?
[101:08.50]There's a lot of boxes over there.
[101:13.34]I want to share my knowledge, but Twitch chat is such an insufficient medium.
[101:17.11]Corporal Small, what do you know?
[101:18.45]Give us the deets.
[101:20.25]Just, um... I mean, if you want German to read what you say, you, like, have to give him money.
[101:25.91]Because he's, like, a greedy guy.
[101:27.35]That is not true.
[101:28.70]Don't even make that joke.
[101:35.38]Oh, what a dick.
[101:41.87]I almost want to play the other guy so I can get in the fucking car.
[101:46.75]I feel so inadequate.
[101:49.69]Where's their box?
[101:50.33]I'm just going to be box collector guy.
[101:55.97]These guys need a commander.
[101:56.95]What are you doing?
[101:58.67]Where's this box?
[102:00.45]Oh, there's one up here.
[102:01.77]Is it up top?
[102:03.67]Oh my god.
[102:04.07]This is not going to be on your screen.
[102:06.75]I don't know where this is.
[102:10.23]Where's the- oh, it's just a shitty health box.
[102:13.47]Glad I spent all that time doing it.
[102:17.33]Wha- you were way- why are you way over there?
[102:18.73]Getting green boxes.
[102:21.13]Oh.
[102:22.97]You could at least read every message.
[102:25.47]Also, I'm already caught up to you.
[102:28.11]Hold on, did you just ask me to read every single chat message?
[102:31.53]Could you?
[102:33.29]I could, but guess what?
[102:34.91]I'm not looking at the game, I have no idea what's happening.
[102:38.17]Do it to prove that you care.
[102:39.80]No.
[102:41.00]This is important.
[102:41.62]We can't lose here.
[102:45.41]In fact, I'm bringing out the big gun here.
[102:50.02]The annoyo gun in my face of that too, that's so horrible We all we both need to play this class and just throw those Get like five people from the same spot.
[103:12.43]Somebody is just like through some yarn over here my fucking ears.
[103:16.21]I
[103:18.84]Not only is that the most annoying visual in the game, it's the most annoying audio cue in the game.
[103:26.16]Fuck, this is too loud.
[103:29.68]Nice shot.
[103:30.22]Am I gonna turn this shit down again?
[103:31.40]I think I do.
[103:40.35]Ah, my eyes and ears.
[103:42.93]Hold on, I...
[103:46.86]Son of a gun.
[103:47.64]You haven't even read a single message.
[103:49.43]Yes, I have.
[103:50.05]Wheelbarrow Street.
[103:51.53]That's the one I picked out to read.
[103:52.95]You're supposed to be reading all of them.
[103:55.31]Get that fucking pogchamp to the chat for that one.
[104:10.44]This is hurting my tinnitus.
[104:11.98]I'm so sorry.
[104:12.57]I'm going to annoy these guys.
[104:15.38]Don't use the annoy gun, please.
[104:18.92]I died for it.
[104:19.66]Are you serious?
[104:21.02]I don't even want to go get you.
[104:27.02]Read out the pogchamps.
[104:30.80]Read out all the pogchamps.
[104:32.26]This guy didn't even read.
[104:35.54]We got copyright TM with a pogchamp.
[104:37.36]What's cracking?
[104:38.10]Pogchamp, yes, pogchamp.
[104:39.10]Stop reading my chat.
[104:39.96]You want to get rezzed?
[104:45.05]You wanna get res?
[104:45.65]Quit reading that chat.
[104:46.55]I'm not even reading pogchamps.
[104:52.95]I know, what a piece of shit.
[104:57.51]God, this is so loud.
[104:59.31]It's at like 3% volume and it's still that loud.
[105:03.93]When will they ever learn?
[105:05.06]Did we win?
[105:09.28]Big problem.
[105:12.76]What'd you say?
[105:13.44]What'd you say?
[105:17.63]There's so many fun characters here.
[105:20.35]Look at all my guys.
[105:21.07]They all have like 30% health.
[105:23.37]All your guys are flying around with 100% HP.
[105:25.25]It's bullshit.
[105:36.92]At least they're resilient.
[105:45.25]Not that resilient.
[105:49.29]I imagine the higher level artillery girl stuff's pretty fun.
[105:52.13]Yeah.
[105:54.27]There's a weapon crate in the river?
[105:55.05]Are you serious?
[105:56.37]No, whatever.
[105:58.95]Whatever.
[105:59.79]Wow, that's a lot of new items.
[106:01.13]Holy shit, do you have this many too?
[106:02.37]Yeah.
[106:03.07]Yeah.
[106:03.45]Oh boy, this is gonna be... Oh boy.
[106:06.98]Oh boy, I don't know about this.
[106:09.30]Yeah.
[106:13.38]Okay, who can do a better job actually talking into a car?
[106:19.53]No.
[106:21.91]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[106:23.27]That's not happening.
[106:24.25]What are we fucking... What are we... What is this?
[106:26.31]What is this?
[106:26.99]Violence?
[106:27.19]What is this?
[106:27.67]What is this?
[106:27.99]Violence?
[106:28.51]What?
[106:28.61]AF-17, huh?
[106:28.77]Hmm...
[106:44.45]Kinda wanna try it.
[106:50.71]Bottle stream?
[106:55.43]No duck noise?
[106:56.19]Yeah.
[106:56.47]Thanks for doing the duck noise.
[106:57.43]Now people are gonna not stop talking about duck- Dude!
[106:59.65]A virtual reality headset.
[107:04.20]Buffalo fingers up.
[107:06.24]Buffalo G3 burst.
[107:10.00]Uh...
[107:11.80]Shit, there's a lot of weapons in this game.
[107:13.47]Sniper rifle?
[107:14.41]Okay.
[107:16.19]4500 damage.
[107:17.23]Guys, I want to try that for sure.
[107:20.05]Oh my god.
[107:21.23]There's some cool stuff I got.
[107:23.27]I feel like we'll fail this mission though, trying these things.
[107:26.92]Use firecracker, you wheelbarrow.
[107:28.88]First of all, hey, thanks for the tip.
[107:30.38]Ban that fucking guy for life.
[107:33.86]Use wheelbarrow.
[107:34.62]No, use firecracker.
[107:37.55]What does he want me to use?
[107:40.60]The firecracker?
[107:41.66]I don't even know what he said.
[107:43.66]I forgot already.
[107:48.18]It was the firecracker, wasn't it?
[107:51.20]Why would you ban him?
[107:51.86]I'm just kidding.
[107:52.30]A lifelong ban is 10 seconds in this channel, if you're new.
[108:07.22]I'm going to do Nova Buster and the Firecracker too.
[108:10.72]I picked a Battering Rim.
[108:13.20]That apparently depletes all of your energy at once.
[108:16.02]And I'll never hit anything with it.
[108:18.86]I'm ready.
[108:19.26]Maybe it'll be loud.
[108:20.58]Forgetful streamer.
[108:21.55]I hope it's really loud.
[108:23.57]I'm pretty forgetful, it's true.
[108:24.81]I think we're ready to go, right?
[108:28.73]Yeah, let's make it together.
[108:30.89]Let's do it together.
[108:32.29]Dark Skate 3.
[108:43.13]Nova Buster But I don't I only get one shot and I just whoa that has one bullet and I just killed them over here What were these trucks I think I can only shoot that one time all I have a grenades now What about the trucks?
[109:09.83]It's gone.
[109:10.13]I don't even know where it is.
[109:12.39]Oh, you're pushing them.
[109:15.61]Let's try the firecracker.
[109:19.36]This thing is fucking stupid.
[109:25.34]That's kind of cool.
[109:26.26]No, it's not cool.
[109:28.48]Wait, wait, wait.
[109:29.52]It's the stupid pop rocks thing.
[109:30.94]You know those snappers you got from the general store when you were 10 years old?
[109:38.16]Good job defending Earth with that one bullet.
[109:40.22]I know, right?
[109:41.36]How far can I throw them?
[109:42.16]These things are fucking stupid.
[109:48.87]Okay, well Star, good luck.
[109:49.99]You have to kill every enemy.
[109:52.17]Because all I have are the Pop Rocks.
[109:55.29]At least they can be crispy and crunchy in your mouth.
[109:57.41]What's your other weapon?
[109:58.51]I had one shot and it's empty.
[110:02.35]What did it do?
[110:04.05]It does 4500 damage in one shot and I can't use it again for the rest of the level.
[110:08.28]And I used it sniping one of our own teammates in the head.
[110:12.77]Now all I have are these little firecrackers.
[110:16.85]Okay, can we restart Return to Lobby?
[110:21.55]I don't want to do the whole mission myself.
[110:23.03]Oh, I have to rejoin the whole thing.
[110:24.39]I left the whole thing.
[110:29.65]Why did you leave?
[110:34.95]Why did you leave?
[110:35.91]I don't know.
[110:38.00]What the hell are you thinking?
[110:40.14]Can you join me?
[110:41.26]No, just join me again.
[110:42.59]You know where it is.
[110:44.35]The name of the game is Pizza Hut.
[110:46.29]Hurry up, get in here before somebody else does.
[110:48.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[110:54.14]I seriously can't reload that gun.
[110:56.00]It's one 4,500 damage shot.
[110:58.52]Unless I'm missing something completely.
[110:59.88]Let me look at that again.
[111:01.06]Choose loadout.
[111:03.11]Lasergun with destructive power equivalent to a tank boasts a tremendous amount of stored energy that can be released instantaneously to obliterate the target.
[111:10.51]However, the output is so extreme that it melts the body of the weapon when fired, meaning you only get one single shot.
[111:17.62]Okay, so we're going to replace that for now because we're not like a boss.
[111:20.72]I feel like a boss.
[111:21.16]Can you turn weapon limit off?
[111:26.02]What?
[111:27.94]There's a limit to the level of weapon that we're allowed to equip.
[111:32.76]I think it's based on the level.
[111:34.98]Isn't it based on the level we're on?
[111:37.09]I guess.
[111:38.19]I don't know if I might have something higher that we haven't found already.
[111:41.75]That would be really weird if we did.
[111:42.89]I don't think I could change this even when I had...
[111:47.00]I don't think I can change this.
[111:48.36]No, it's great.
[111:50.02]Okay.
[111:51.18]I might do it for like Harden and stuff like that.
[111:54.28]Whatever.
[111:54.56]Let's go.
[111:55.61]Hold on.
[111:55.99]Wait, wait, wait.
[111:56.95]I don't want the Nova Busters.
[111:58.53]Alright, this one's gas operated.
[112:02.23]Alright, I'm going to do Sparrow Shot.
[112:06.41]Firecrackers.
[112:08.72]High Cycle Reverser.
[112:11.90]No, I don't want that.
[112:12.78]What about the other ones over here?
[112:13.92]Slugshots, Barrow Shot, Buffalo G3, AF-17.
[112:16.96]I'll give this one a try.
[112:21.43]Edit the save file.
[112:23.91]I like that callback to last night.
[112:25.29]It was a good callback.
[112:29.39]Now we're cooking with C plus gas.
[112:31.74]What is C plus gas?
[112:34.56]It's better than D. Is it D gas?
[112:37.58]Oh, is that weapon a C plus?
[112:39.72]Well, give me a second.
[112:44.44]All right, that's cool automag not that long a reload either what's the a of seven What oh my god, this is a really long cool down you don't have another like annoying grenade do you oh no no no, okay, so you are a
[113:08.72]You're like Cell.
[113:10.08]Okay.
[113:10.38]I'm- I'm Goku.
[113:12.20]And you're like, ah, fuck.
[113:23.00]Okay, here's the difference.
[113:24.96]I'm- I'm- who's the guy that's from Earth that sucks?
[113:29.16]Um... The guy that's like the strongest man on Earth but he sucks in the grand scheme of things.
[113:33.28]Gohan?
[113:33.58]No, Master like... Strongest in the universe.
[113:35.56]No, Master like fucking... What's his name?
[113:37.98]He's got the big hair and he's got the big goatee face.
[113:40.18]Hey, let me tell you something.
[113:41.78]I'm the strongest man in the world.
[113:43.72]Come on.
[113:44.42]I've never even seen the show.
[113:46.68]Ah, the spirit bomb!
[113:47.46]I'm gonna try to fight.
[113:48.48]Mr. Satan, right?
[113:54.36]Let me tell you something.
[113:55.50]You know, I'm the strongest man in the whole world.
[113:57.05]You're not going to be able to fight me in a one-on-one combat.
[114:00.03]Hercule.
[114:00.55]Hercule.
[114:01.47]See, I'm Hercule now.
[114:08.65]You're the strongest man in the universe.
[114:10.55]It's not going to happen.
[114:12.29]It's not going to happen.
[114:14.15]You're dropping asteroids.
[114:16.76]Boom.
[114:18.50]It still didn't kill it.
[114:20.56]Can we restart?
[114:22.12]Why?
[114:22.74]Because look at our health!
[114:23.70]We have enough to spawn door!
[114:26.96]Just come over here for a minute.
[114:29.35]Let me do my joke.
[114:30.31]You got to do your joke.
[114:30.95]Don't make me Goku you again.
[114:32.41]You got to do your joke.
[114:33.27]I didn't... Misses all his... Do you see how inaccurate this fucking gun is?
[114:43.49]What do you mean misses all his shots?
[114:44.79]Come on!
[114:45.19]Do you want a PvP?
[114:47.24]Hey, do me a favor.
[114:48.18]Stand still down here.
[114:49.76]I want to show you that I'm the strongest man in the whole world.
[114:52.82]Goku.
[114:54.18]Okay.
[114:56.24]Oh, you're already... I'm out of your range.
[115:00.18]Get fucked.
[115:00.76]Oh, my God.
[115:01.39]Hey, that's it.
[115:03.27]I'm the strongest man in the world.
[115:06.15]That didn't even hurt you.
[115:11.76]This is where the game gets derailed.
[115:15.90]Why did I not do any damage to you?
[115:18.15]You did like half.
[115:19.41]No I didn't, you had full health.
[115:21.73]I lost some health.
[115:22.41]Alright, no more fucking around.
[115:23.57]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[115:25.15]Let's go.
[115:27.47]Good joke.
[115:29.05]Yes sir!
[115:29.52]The meteor's incoming!
[115:37.02]Why do you get such cool moves as that character and I get like default machine guns?
[115:41.79]Hey, you want to see my cool move?
[115:42.91]Hey, wait, wait, stop right there.
[115:44.05]You have like fucking asteroids and giant like super big explosion.
[115:47.02]Yeah.
[115:50.76]You picked the ranger.
[115:51.82]The ranger is like the dumbest thing.
[115:57.22]I just had a shotgun shoot.
[115:59.74]What do you got giant acid bombs?
[116:01.63]Oh, watch this.
[116:05.71]You should have played tank girl.
[116:07.35]No, it's too slow.
[116:09.82]I picked the default machine gun guy.
[116:10.76]Oh, I know what that sound means.
[116:11.48]I know, what was I thinking?
[116:13.88]I could carry you for a mission, and you'll get it in tank girl.
[116:17.08]I don't want to be tank person.
[116:19.16]Look, just get in the wheelbarrow.
[116:20.46]Alright, I'm gonna be tank person.
[116:21.95]Where's the wheelbarrow?
[116:22.73]Get me in it.
[116:26.53]That's such a fucking cool move.
[116:30.13]He can roll, he can roll, you're right.
[116:34.01]This gun's actually pretty good.
[116:36.97]I was talking shit before, but now I'm not going to talk so much shit.
[116:40.57]I am playing as Hercule.
[116:42.99]I'm dead.
[116:46.83]I'm going to die.
[116:48.51]What's happening right now to me?
[116:52.19]Star?
[116:53.25]Vegeta will save you!
[116:54.57]Star, you're going to have to drop a spirit bomb on me.
[116:56.21]I don't even know what... What are these linking... What does this mean?
[117:01.66]What does this mean?
[117:06.91]God.
[117:08.31]Pick Tank Girl.
[117:09.35]I'm being Tank Girl.
[117:11.54]Air Raider.
[117:12.28]I already have this.
[117:12.88]Level 18.
[117:13.12]Actually, I'm okay.
[117:14.90]I'm okay.
[117:15.28]I have the level 16 Grape.
[117:18.42]You gotta protect me, though.
[117:19.98]But wasn't the Grape just, like, worse than the tank?
[117:22.46]Yeah, but it's still level 16.
[117:23.67]I'm not gonna be useless.
[117:27.43]He can't even roll?
[117:28.21]What are you talking about?
[117:28.79]He can't even roll.
[117:30.27]I was rolling.
[117:35.21]Spider grab?
[117:35.84]Yeah, I know, I'm just being an idiot.
[117:36.96]Okay, so I'm alright.
[117:38.38]Let me get my vehicle, make it make rape.
[117:42.68]The artillery thing actually is pretty damn cool.
[117:44.72]I don't know why I was playing as the default shotgun person.
[117:48.49]Come on, college boy.
[117:49.33]You were hoping he was going to get something better, and you were disappointed because I started shooting spirit bombs.
[117:53.63]Somebody called me college boy.
[117:55.13]I'm not sure if that's an insult.
[117:56.69]I think it might be.
[117:58.67]Yeah, I have a college boy.
[118:00.05]These goddamn city slickers.
[118:04.16]I like his weapons better, too.
[118:05.50]Yeah.
[118:05.94]I hate these spiders.
[118:06.90]Plus, you're not going to be that much faster than me anymore.
[118:10.74]I'll be fine.
[118:15.57]Alright, here we go.
[118:19.07]Oh, boy.
[118:20.13]Why is there... There's a spider right there.
[118:23.03]I'll take care of it.
[118:23.71]Don't worry.
[118:29.23]These are just free shots.
[118:30.33]Eventually, it'll die.
[118:40.44]It's in a really weird spot, but I kind of don't want to go get it.
[118:42.98]I'm just going to wait until it dies.
[118:45.54]It's not dead.
[118:54.44]Well, okay.
[118:59.16]Oh, God.
[119:01.06]It's like a million health.
[119:10.92]What the hell are you?
[119:11.92]I'm trying to kill one spider with the tank.
[119:14.80]I've done like half the level.
[119:16.16]Okay, so that was fun.
[119:18.66]I had to shoot a hundred rounds to kill that one spider.
[119:22.46]You're in like a support drive me thing.
[119:25.41]I know, but I'm just saying.
[119:26.55]And this spider's everywhere now.
[119:29.49]Yeah, fuck this thing.
[119:34.65]Don't spirit bomb yet.
[119:35.45]Wait till I get out.
[119:35.93]Okay, you can do whatever the fuck you want now.
[119:44.93]The mothership is going to land.
[119:48.25]I like this weapon though.
[119:49.07]Sure.
[119:50.11]Where is it?
[119:53.80]Play as jetpack woman?
[119:54.90]No, I don't want to do that.
[119:56.58]I want to play as like transport tank man, but I feel like eventually he's going to destroy the ship.
[120:02.37]As soon as you get like some actual higher level artillery.
[120:07.39]When the mothership comes, you just artillery it, you know?
[120:10.21]I just got insulted.
[120:11.87]This person named this slowpoke after me in their game.
[120:17.43]I want you to make me your Ratatouille.
[120:19.41]That's, like, better.
[120:20.06]All of them are just using this thing to drive.
[120:26.04]I feel like that's probably what I should have been doing in the first place.
[120:31.10]Okay.
[120:32.48]Get back in the car and drive over there.
[120:40.67]Is that going to reach from here?
[120:41.47]I guess it is.
[120:42.90]I ran that lady over, but who cares.
[120:50.22]Come on, Ratatouille.
[120:51.02]Right in the head.
[120:56.56]That was a headshot.
[120:58.66]I don't know what happened.
[120:59.74]Revive me.
[121:00.44]I don't know what happened.
[121:03.50]Game sucks?
[121:04.23]No, my character exploded.
[121:08.34]Did I hit, like, an imaginary wall?
[121:09.00]Shit.
[121:10.10]Watch out.
[121:15.30]Oh, it's a pile of the boys.
[121:17.94]That is a pile of boys, and that's what we're gonna do.
[121:21.15]Watch out.
[121:22.35]I'm just throwing a fucking artillery deck.
[121:23.31]Daaaaaaap!
[121:26.75]Wah!
[121:32.05]Watch out, watch out, get out of there.
[121:33.57]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[121:34.69]Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[121:35.97]Get out, get out.
[121:38.93]You missed the artillery.
[121:40.47]No I did, I killed all those things.
[121:42.94]Just come get me, you little shit.
[121:48.54]Alright, I'm fine.
[121:54.45]I can scope this idiot out.
[122:00.08]No, don't get hit by that shit.
[122:01.56]Okay, this guy has the dodge too.
[122:03.58]He's like just as good as the soldier, but he has machine.
[122:06.46]Machine.
[122:06.90]He has machine.
[122:08.40]He has machine.
[122:09.15]Okay, good to know.
[122:09.95]He has machine.
[122:12.15]He's just as good, but has machine.
[122:16.17]How many of these in the head do I have to hit before this fucking thing is dead?
[122:20.59]I'm in a bad spot right now.
[122:21.87]I really feel like I am playing Dark Souls with these things.
[122:28.33]There we go.
[122:29.91]Shit.
[122:30.39]I didn't even know he was right there.
[122:31.51]I'm in trouble.
[122:32.01]I'm dead.
[122:36.31]Why are you all the way back there?
[122:37.19]Because there are two stragglers I want to go kill.
[122:40.00]Why are you dead for a third time?
[122:41.32]Because there's fucking spiders everywhere.
[122:43.84]And this is the way we need to go.
[122:45.38]Yeah, so I killed the stuff in the back so our soldiers would come forward and get shot by the spiders instead of us.
[122:50.61]I dare you to come rescue me.
[122:57.85]I just saw somebody do a fail fish and that's like just making me very upset right now.
[123:01.96]Maybe you're just bad at the game, ban that guy forever.
[123:08.28]No, I'm playing a character that I don't have any items for.
[123:13.34]Sorry we all can't be the fucking overpowered fly lady.
[123:19.05]I want variety.
[123:26.85]Sorry, we all can't be in wheelbarrows.
[123:28.36]Alright, how come when you attack these things, they die, but when I have to shoot them like a hundred fucking times?
[123:37.94]Because you have nuclear bombs.
[123:40.06]Okay, speaking of nuclear bombs, get the fuck out of there.
[123:44.17]I would make my way away from that if I were you.
[123:50.55]Here we go, this is gonna be fucking mayhem.
[123:54.98]Yeah, and what'd you all say?
[123:56.58]You all say I wasn't good?
[123:58.66]And do you see my plan?
[124:00.05]I just launch Star closer to me.
[124:03.63]I put that on his body.
[124:10.71]Oh, wait, I can assess the situation.
[124:12.08]Do you even have enough health to revive me?
[124:15.28]Yes.
[124:16.68]There's health up here.
[124:17.42]Let me get you first, and then you can...
[124:24.88]Go for it.
[124:31.30]Can't shoot it that close to me.
[124:35.86]I didn't die again.
[124:36.56]I'm fine.
[124:39.81]Come on, man.
[124:40.43]How much health do you got?
[124:49.37]You good on health?
[124:52.36]I'd rather be alive than have you be alive.
[124:55.18]That wasn't very nice.
[124:59.40]Alright, I'm getting the tank down.
[125:00.26]You want to get in the tank?
[125:02.54]No.
[125:03.52]I don't.
[125:04.40]You shitty grape.
[125:06.04]Alright, well, we just beat it.
[125:12.86]Believe me.
[125:13.48]I wish they had, like, at the end of a lot of things where it shows, like, kill percentages.
[125:18.41]Yeah?
[125:19.47]Where's the scoreboard?
[125:20.41]I didn't even get a goddamn...
[125:23.23]I didn't even get one.
[125:25.69]Well, destroy the giant creatures in the city.
[125:28.39]The mothership is approaching.
[125:29.41]Uh-oh.
[125:34.56]This is a boss.
[125:36.00]Are you going to want to get some items first?
[125:37.62]Or do you want to just get carry?
[125:41.60]Oh yeah, because your howitzer is level zero.
[125:43.71]I know, that's what I'm saying.
[125:44.87]Let's just do an older mission real fast.
[125:47.23]Let's just do, what was an easy one that we already did?
[125:49.13]Like retaliation or something?
[125:50.17]Or like wind shear?
[125:51.47]Let's just do wind shear.
[125:58.39]Get the sniper.
[125:59.17]Yeah, the sniper.
[125:59.73]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[126:00.82]Go back.
[126:01.36]No, not this one.
[126:02.14]What's that?
[126:02.86]One without spiders.
[126:04.54]The more ants, the more item drops there were.
[126:06.66]All right, this one.
[126:11.42]Winged war goddess.
[126:12.34]Yeah, that's me.
[126:13.26]Use the super soaker.
[126:20.87]It's been approaching for five missions.
[126:25.21]Somebody just said, I'm pretty sure this is the one with no crates.
[126:29.26]it might be I agree with chat mission two had a lot of a lot of guys straight alleyway yeah mission two is pretty easy on inferno as well oh no this one's fine careful I'm shooting up there and blowing up I'm gonna detonate the uh bridge just in case you were wondering I'm detonating the bread
[127:02.38]Give me those crates.
[127:06.89]Oh, sing the crate song.
[127:08.59]Shit, that's right in front of my face.
[127:09.83]Don't not detonate that while I'm standing in front of it.
[127:15.27]Any crates yet?
[127:16.31]No?
[127:23.04]Okay.
[127:24.92]A spider got you.
[127:29.21]Yep.
[127:31.05]Cell's right there.
[127:32.93]There's health everywhere, actually.
[127:34.27]There's a big one right there.
[127:37.01]Get that one.
[127:41.96]Spider bit you.
[127:44.58]Spider bit me.
[127:46.12]Alright, hold on now.
[127:47.64]Be careful where you go right here, because I'm doing an artillery all the way down there.
[127:52.45]Okay.
[127:55.96]That's gonna get it like it marks on the map.
[127:58.05]Yeah, just watch out I'm gonna get like in the area of effect of it on the map isn't Okay.
[128:02.85]Now wait, depending on how I rotate my map I just raised hell right there Complete hell-raising
[128:24.57]This manual detonation thing is really great.
[128:28.08]I like this character, but I want more options.
[128:31.74]You get unhealthy.
[128:32.44]I want you to get a better artillery.
[128:37.96]Then I'll respect you.
[128:41.03]But not before then.
[128:41.89]Have you picked up any green crates?
[128:44.59]Nope.
[128:47.25]Shit.
[128:49.57]We did it.
[128:49.89]We saved the city.
[128:56.42]Sometimes you gotta crack a couple eggs to quench your thirst.
[129:00.40]That's your joke, right?
[129:01.04]That's not how it goes.
[129:03.99]Sometimes you gotta crack a couple eggs before the egg shows up.
[129:10.75]Uh, where's this?
[129:14.23]Sorry I just destroyed your whole building, but there's a box over here somewhere.
[129:17.72]Oh, sorry, it was just a health pack.
[129:22.06]Sorry for destroying your whole fucking city.
[129:24.30]Why'd you take the health pack?
[129:25.34]They were gonna need it.
[129:31.77]Dude, no, no, what the fuck, dude?
[129:35.65]Come on.
[129:36.65]Let's do mission two.
[129:37.67]No, why did you do that?
[129:38.95]Mission two, mission two, mission two.
[129:40.89]Mission two on hardest.
[129:43.59]We were gonna get... There were still like two more things after that.
[129:48.34]You're gonna drive me to the moon.
[129:50.16]It was an accident, it was an accident.
[129:54.40]All right, mission two on Inferno, right?
[129:57.48]Yeah, yeah, let's do it.
[130:00.04]Where do I do difficulty?
[130:03.88]I'm even taking off my suicide blade.
[130:07.16]Okay, we're on Inferno now.
[130:09.12]So, in case you were curious.
[130:11.56]Yeah.
[130:12.98]Okay.
[130:18.19]Son of a gun.
[130:18.95]Why does it keep showing me this guy breaking through glass here?
[130:32.34]If you do Mission 2 on Inferno, you won't be able to use any of the weapons you get on Hard.
[130:37.72]What?
[130:40.12]Hold on.
[130:40.62]Are we being double manipulated?
[130:44.19]I think we might get really high level weapons here and then we can't do anything but Inferno maybe.
[130:50.23]Somebody confirm in the chat if we're like fucking ourselves royally right now.
[130:55.43]I'm throwing an artillery down there.
[130:57.20]Watch out.
[130:58.58]All the way down.
[131:03.27]That's right in the middle.
[131:04.09]That's right in the whole thing.
[131:05.19]It's gonna be good.
[131:11.59]Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[131:14.00]Oh my god.
[131:15.48]And the thing is, it's infernal.
[131:18.00]They're not dead.
[131:18.86]None of them died.
[131:20.36]All I did is just spread them around.
[131:24.10]Oh, it's your level zero thing, apparently.
[131:26.05]It doesn't do enough damage.
[131:28.43]It didn't do anything.
[131:29.37]I'm just gonna hide in here.
[131:32.75]Give me my tank.
[131:34.49]Oh, no, tank's dead.
[131:35.47]Tank died.
[131:36.59]Tank died in one second.
[131:39.51]Okay, yeah, this is gonna be a pain in the ass.
[131:41.67]I'm dead.
[131:42.55]We're not gonna be able to do this.
[131:44.19]I'm dead.
[131:53.42]I think I got hit one time.
[131:54.60]Yeah, me too.
[131:55.40]It was instant death.
[131:57.25]Oh, shit.
[131:57.97]Okay, well... Maybe we should just do hard again?
[132:02.75]They one-shot kill.
[132:05.79]My lord.
[132:06.39]Okay, well... Wait!
[132:11.06]Oh.
[132:11.86]Hard or hardest?
[132:15.72]Hardest.
[132:17.46]Same mission?
[132:18.00]Try it again?
[132:18.42]Just would not instantly lose?
[132:20.08]Yeah.
[132:22.92]Let's go.
[132:27.82]Look at these whale barrel streamers.
[132:31.28]I know.
[132:31.56]Who are you mashing your keyboard to right now?
[132:41.55]I'm WSAD-ing to, like, get in the zone.
[132:44.17]Hold on, hold on.
[132:44.65]Even on hardest, I don't think you can use the weapons you get on hard.
[132:48.87]Huh.
[132:50.59]Well, that's good to know.
[132:53.91]Kind of.
[132:58.26]I'm just going for it again.
[133:00.80]I'm just going to drop it right there.
[133:05.70]Is that far enough?
[133:06.36]It is.
[133:06.68]Alright, give them the grape.
[133:09.86]And pray that these guys don't get launched all the way across the map to come get us.
[133:19.14]Oh, come on.
[133:20.92]That's not going to work.
[133:21.72]It's not going to happen.
[133:22.70]That thing is so weak.
[133:29.54]it really is such a piece of would you like to um your crate coming down I shot and it killed me he just like skidded in front of me I think we might actually do this this is doable it's just they're all but hopefully we can actually use these items no it's inherently a little bit spread out
[134:00.78]It's only mission two.
[134:01.54]There's not a whole lot here.
[134:02.52]Can I get some bailfishes in the chat?
[134:10.04]Oh shit.
[134:11.68]That just freaked me out.
[134:17.44]I got one.
[134:19.52]I got one shot.
[134:20.76]Jesus, did you really?
[134:23.06]I can get you.
[134:23.54]Hold on.
[134:24.62]I didn't want to... I just had to switch my rep red.
[134:27.48]Oh fuck, there's a guy right here.
[134:31.38]And... 50 health.
[134:33.58]Look at all these crates, though.
[134:34.52]There's a shitload.
[134:37.09]What is... Where's this enemy?
[134:43.85]What is going on?
[134:45.59]He's under the ground.
[134:47.01]His legs are coming up behind you.
[134:50.89]Okay, by blue... No, there he is.
[134:54.61]Jesus.
[134:55.27]At least pick up the armor.
[134:57.22]That's good.
[134:59.21]Great behind.
[134:59.79]Was there one?
[135:00.27]Oh, there it is.
[135:00.63]There it is.
[135:00.95]Yep.
[135:01.33]Oh, look at that chat.
[135:02.15]Look at this great chat.
[135:05.46]Could you please not call out when you see purple rocks?
[135:09.20]Huh?
[135:10.16]The blue rocks.
[135:12.16]Please?
[135:12.68]Wow, the streamer missed a purple rock.
[135:16.32]Called him purple too.
[135:17.80]Just driving in a straight line.
[135:24.01]Hopefully I hit somebody with this.
[135:28.59]Hopefully that person is not you out of the air for some reason.
[135:37.75]Artillery going all the way down.
[135:39.31]No, don't, don't, don't.
[135:40.47]No, no, I did.
[135:41.19]It's way far down.
[135:41.99]Don't worry.
[135:42.31]You're going to be fine.
[135:43.49]No, I mean, it's just going to push them around.
[135:45.27]It's way easier to kill them when they're not, like, spread around.
[135:47.59]That's going to hit you.
[135:48.11]You've got to back up.
[135:48.69]You're going to get hit by that, like, right now.
[135:50.61]Back up, please.
[135:52.69]You lucky son of a gun.
[135:55.09]No, it's killing them.
[135:56.67]That guy will get at least two or three.
[136:00.02]Shut up.
[136:00.44]All right.
[136:01.02]Come on.
[136:01.48]Give me a break.
[136:03.61]Now you have to go find the stragglers and go kill them.
[136:07.65]There's health there, but I don't feel like it.
[136:19.01]Ooh, knock the building down at least.
[136:20.45]Any more crates?
[136:24.35]You know those things we need?
[136:31.88]Sorry, I'm not helping I'm going a mile away to where these insects got blown that wasn't even me You're abandoning me there's a lot of these ants here Oh fuck watch out right behind behind behind mine
[137:01.32]Intense this is Halloween.
[137:03.94]This is well, we're not even at the hardest part yet I just watched a weapon chest go through the ground I'm scared to shoot over there.
[137:21.36]Oh, whoops.
[137:22.20]I used up all my thing.
[137:23.71]Oh
[137:29.63]I want to use my shit, but I can't.
[137:31.23]It's not going to do anything.
[137:33.63]It's just going to make it worse.
[137:34.45]This guy's trying to wrap around us.
[137:40.46]This ant over here on the right.
[137:44.44]Ooh, that was not bad.
[137:45.52]That wasn't bad at all.
[137:47.16]You know what they say.
[137:50.72]What do they say?
[137:55.77]I see a lot of crates.
[137:59.79]Let's go back to hard.
[138:02.23]Because all we're trying to do is get you one goddamn weapon.
[138:05.51]I just die shit.
[138:07.89]I can get you it.
[138:08.53]No, I can't.
[138:08.99]I'm instantly dead.
[138:12.99]These cheese puffs, man.
[138:14.23]Like, if I'm going in to actually do damage with the weapon I have equipped, if one cheese puff hits me, I die.
[138:19.11]You call them cheese puffs?
[138:21.13]Yeah.
[138:24.03]Somebody said, Elabo, the streamer is getting carried.
[138:28.05]Obviously.
[138:28.53]Yeah, like if we had two people doing that mission, it would be better.
[138:31.79]I need weapons.
[138:35.49]Alright, this is on hard.
[138:42.56]He tripped.
[138:43.06]Sorry, you tripped.
[138:45.74]I thought this guy beat Dark Souls 3.
[138:47.26]I did too.
[138:47.80]I'm going to mute for a second.
[138:54.35]Thank you to Soviet Solid, Benji the Sponge, for your new subscriptions.
[138:58.39]Grandmaster Engineering for three months.
[138:59.87]I don't know what I'm looking at, but I love it.
[139:01.23]I love you, Germa.
[139:02.33]Well, thanks, man.
[139:03.71]Thanks for three months.
[139:05.41]Thrillville for five months.
[139:06.57]How was the Snickers?
[139:07.47]You're talking about Starla.
[139:08.49]I'll make sure to ask him when I get back.
[139:12.88]And then we had some bits from a bunch of people.
[139:18.52]Thanks for the bits, guys.
[139:20.94]You guys are dropping fucking bits.
[139:27.46]How was the Snickers?
[139:28.78]Yeah.
[139:29.56]Good.
[139:30.16]Was it good?
[139:31.46]Yeah.
[139:33.82]There you go.
[139:34.10]Gains my life.
[139:35.18]Yeah, it was great.
[139:39.27]Alright, let's get this done.
[139:40.97]Here.
[139:41.43]I have a cool artillery attack I'm gonna use.
[139:44.09]Me too.
[139:49.48]Look, you do your artillery and then I do mine.
[139:51.00]I just did mine.
[139:52.54]Mine's all the way in the back lines.
[139:57.93]What happened?
[139:59.43]What?
[140:00.89]Did it?
[140:01.77]There we go.
[140:04.10]Oh man, it still didn't do any fi- this is like... Alright, I ain't gonna even use that until I get another one.
[140:12.64]Because even though I hit it, it just launched him around again.
[140:14.98]Not hard.
[140:17.97]Where is this ant?
[140:19.17]There you are.
[140:22.37]Was it inherently satisfying?
[140:26.49]Clutch or kick?
[140:29.32]I hope we do it.
[140:30.14]I'm going to get this box while you carry me.
[140:38.32]You want me to call someone else?
[140:39.26]That's what's happening.
[140:40.44]You're the guy with the good items.
[140:41.54]I'm the new guy.
[140:42.30]There's one dumb ant over there.
[140:46.64]Got him.
[140:49.34]There's like one in our spawn.
[140:50.72]Okay.
[140:56.15]Use the howitzer.
[140:58.46]We just need to do one mission where I get at least one or two weapons.
[141:01.29]And then I can pick between what the hell I want to actually have for a loadout.
[141:03.65]Because right now I only have these little things.
[141:07.43]My character's not very good.
[141:13.91]I'd like to see the thing that I always ask to see.
[141:17.68]If I could see it.
[141:20.12]You know that thing that I always ask for?
[141:21.42]When things happen?
[141:24.86]There's an ammo crate right there.
[141:28.39]Where?
[141:29.65]I'm about to get it.
[141:30.21]I got it.
[141:34.41]There's a box over there.
[141:39.30]Easy.
[141:39.66]I love that Failfish is taking over.
[141:53.97]What box is that?
[141:56.67]The weapon.
[141:57.73]Was it?
[141:57.97]Good.
[142:00.48]I'm just going to drive around.
[142:03.87]Good luck.
[142:05.89]Once I get up there far enough though.
[142:07.33]Actually, I'll just throw this up there.
[142:09.09]How far up are they?
[142:10.11]Don't, don't.
[142:10.97]Please don't.
[142:11.77]It can go really fucking far, dude.
[142:13.43]I don't think you... And just push this thing around.
[142:15.47]I don't think you understand how much more work it's making me do.
[142:19.43]Hey, I'm doing this on purpose.
[142:20.99]I'm trying to hit him.
[142:21.53]What are you talking about?
[142:24.75]It doesn't like push them that far.
[142:35.02]Can I drive this?
[142:35.68]What the fuck, man?
[142:36.38]Let's go.
[142:40.19]I can't even drive this thing up the goddamn hill.
[142:44.75]Hope you're having fun playing the game.
[142:47.17]I can't drive up this fucking hill.
[142:48.67]Get out.
[142:49.03]Let's just go.
[142:50.29]We're going to beat this before... By the time I get there, it's going to be over.
[143:01.06]A lot of people over there.
[143:08.00]Remember, I'm just on box duty.
[143:14.57]That's not the box I want, but I'll take it.
[143:21.13]Hello?
[143:23.19]Hello?
[143:24.39]I'm gaming.
[143:25.71]I'm gaming.
[143:26.43]I'm gaming.
[143:28.27]I thought I was still muted.
[143:31.51]No, I'm just gaming.
[143:33.90]I love, like, grinding this shit.
[143:35.18]You know what I mean?
[143:36.18]It's fun.
[143:42.00]Okay, Star is playing a shoot bugs game.
[143:44.44]I'm just playing Stardew Valley.
[143:46.75]We're gonna pick up my crops.
[143:48.99]Boy, that was a good crop.
[143:50.41]Help me pick these up.
[143:51.05]That was a good crop.
[143:52.15]I'm not fast enough to pick up these other ones.
[143:53.59]Quick, quick, quick, quick.
[143:54.13]There's, like, there's one more right in front of me.
[143:55.19]There's one more area that we have to do before we... Oh, that was it.
[144:00.21]You have to go to the park and then they rush, they do a big... No, that's it.
[144:03.29]Oh, I thought there was the park up ahead.
[144:05.37]Not on this mission, this mission too.
[144:06.43]Oh no, yeah, that mission's quick and you do get a lot of boxes.
[144:09.24]Yeah, we should have some new items here.
[144:10.74]Let's take a look.
[144:13.50]Alright, there we go.
[144:15.74]Satellite blaster, 150mm cannon.
[144:18.34]This thing's called Attack Whale.
[144:22.14]Bike?
[144:23.38]Yeah, you had me at bike.
[144:27.77]Uh, bike.
[144:29.85]Two people on this bike.
[144:31.41]We're about to play GTA.
[144:32.75]I'm doing the bike.
[144:33.27]I don't even care what it is.
[144:36.15]Okay.
[144:37.54]This is cannon A artillery.
[144:40.20]This one's the highest level.
[144:42.73]Okay.
[145:08.36]So this is for like a one shot there.
[145:11.40]It's not necessarily... You don't want that for a big area.
[145:14.51]Make the whale proud.
[145:15.25]AC-130.
[145:15.95]A laser guide kit that transmits coordinates to the satellite.
[145:20.35]Nothing to direct satellite blasts.
[145:21.77]Okay.
[145:26.89]I'm just going to... We'll give it a... It's a sniper though.
[145:33.70]We'll try the attack whale.
[145:34.72]Why not?
[145:37.17]Okay, let's go kill Mother.
[145:38.51]Hold on.
[145:39.75]Limp it gun, limp it sniper.
[145:41.03]Ow!
[145:46.26]I'm gonna try the sniper.
[145:47.72]And I have the new- I have the bike too.
[145:50.68]And I have new armor.
[145:52.28]And I gotta make up the German 985 colors.
[145:54.50]Cause that's my channel, you know what I'm sayin'?
[145:56.17]Alright.
[145:59.19]That's his channel!
[146:00.81]Know what he's sayin'?
[146:02.55]Let's do- you wanna do the one before that?
[146:04.51]The tenth mission?
[146:07.22]I don't want to do that spider one again.
[146:08.96]You want to do... Wait, you don't want to do this one again?
[146:11.66]The number 9?
[146:13.60]No, number 9 was really boring.
[146:15.76]Alright, do you just want to try number 10?
[146:18.36]Yeah.
[146:19.32]Alright.
[146:21.90]Let's see.
[146:22.32]This is number 10.
[146:24.88]I want to progress the storyline.
[146:28.08]Yeah.
[146:32.68]I mean, I have the whale.
[146:34.72]I wonder how much damage it does.
[146:37.80]What level were they?
[146:39.04]I level large, number 9.
[146:40.30]Oh my god, that makes me so hungry, dude.
[146:42.56]Number 9 from D'Angelo's is like the greatest thing.
[146:46.96]Fuck, what time is it?
[146:48.60]No, they're not open.
[146:49.42]Shit.
[146:51.76]Self-promotion on your own screen.
[146:58.80]Damn.
[147:00.18]Alright, there's a... I can have three bikes?
[147:03.86]I'm confused.
[147:09.89]Can I give you a bike, too?
[147:11.01]That's kind of weird.
[147:17.87]This thing takes a long time to reload.
[147:19.63]Where's my bike, man?
[147:28.26]Oh, look at this.
[147:28.80]Okay, get in the machine gun seat.
[147:32.72]Have you just been summoning that thing this whole time?
[147:34.80]No, I haven't.
[147:36.76]I'm trying to drive it.
[147:37.44]Here we go.
[147:37.72]Alright, get on it.
[147:39.10]I need my gunner.
[147:42.34]Come on!
[147:45.60]Wanna kill the thing over here, because you're not gonna drive over there.
[147:47.87]I can't even drive straight with the wheels fucked up on this thing?
[147:54.79]This thing is like not driving.
[147:56.05]Okay, I'm coming.
[147:57.53]Honest to god, what is wrong with this fucking bike?
[148:01.35]It's like the wheels have been buttered.
[148:05.50]I can't turn the gun.
[148:06.45]I can only shoot straight.
[148:07.23]I can't drive!
[148:08.33]It's not letting me drive.
[148:10.45]When I hit W, it just skids out.
[148:16.45]Why is it such a piece of shit?
[148:20.82]Oh, I can't aim it.
[148:21.48]It was just really awkward.
[148:23.90]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[148:25.14]That thing sucks.
[148:25.92]Get out.
[148:26.22]I'm going with the attack, Will.
[148:33.79]Holy shit!
[148:37.15]Okay, that thing's kind of crazy.
[148:39.73]I missed it.
[148:41.37]I didn't expect it to come in that fast.
[148:42.61]Yeah, within like three seconds it just fires a massive shotgun at the ground.
[148:54.15]Same key for gas and brake?
[148:55.83]I don't know what the hell was going on.
[148:57.15]It was weird.
[149:01.51]Spirit Guide is the way all that is.
[149:02.85]You're right.
[149:07.60]The explosion radius is tiny on this thing.
[149:13.57]We're good.
[149:13.81]I thought it was going to be... That would be awesome if it was a bicycle.
[149:19.07]It would be better.
[149:19.57]Maybe it wouldn't skid out.
[149:21.90]Oh, this gun is terrible.
[149:22.94]I tried to use the gun on it.
[149:31.09]It only takes 300 credits to reload the wheel.
[149:33.65]That's actually pretty awesome.
[149:36.15]I would ride my bike there, but there's no way to ride it.
[149:41.53]Let's try.
[149:42.15]No way to ride it.
[149:43.23]Look at this.
[149:44.65]I'm just trying to turn.
[149:48.35]I'm holding W right now.
[149:49.91]There's some really, like the grenade that I was throwing, I really hate.
[149:52.88]Just because the aiming reticle, you have to like trick it into aiming it where you want to.
[149:57.58]Oh, I didn't even see that ship in the sky.
[150:00.61]You guys might think I'm like a moron right now, but I swear to God, I am not doing anything real.
[150:07.07]I'm just trying to press W. Let, fucking, watch out.
[150:12.04]Get out of the, no, watch out!
[150:13.76]Watch out for him!
[150:36.57]I thought that was the regular grenade.
[150:39.81]I was trying to make a point that... Fuck me.
[150:45.76]I'll do that all again.
[150:46.72]I thought it was this thing and I was going to just wait until we got away and I was going to detonate it.
[150:54.20]Oh boy, oh fucking boy.
[150:58.02]I dropped the fucking whale on it.
[151:01.49]You guys think I'm a moron.
[151:02.79]God damn it.
[151:06.56]I had this nightmare once.
[151:11.21]I had this nightmare this one time, I was playing with this guy.
[151:13.89]Although I can do two of these at the same time.
[151:23.52]I love how that... It was like... I have no excuse there.
[151:40.23]You get to be the fun character.
[151:42.45]You could play it too.
[151:43.59]No, but that's not cool.
[151:45.27]That's not fun.
[151:46.23]They kept zapping us and zapping us and zapping us.
[151:48.77]Idiot!
[151:57.27]R.I.P.
[151:58.19]His last words were, you might think I'm a moron.
[152:03.44]And you know, when you do it live, you can't hide.
[152:06.33]You can't hide the fact that you're a fucking klutz.
[152:12.99]Just embrace it.
[152:13.75]Yeah, I gotta embrace it at this point.
[152:19.76]There's another vehicle I can pick to.
[152:24.92]Are you doing anything?
[152:27.46]No, because you're much faster than me and my bike doesn't work.
[152:30.02]I've almost killed this whole thing already.
[152:33.35]Sorry I don't have a working vehicle.
[152:39.41]They're still carrying me until I get an item that's good.
[152:41.61]How long is that going to take?
[152:44.97]I don't know.
[152:45.75]I'll see you at like a fucking 24 hour stream, confirmed.
[152:47.91]Nice job.
[152:54.34]Yeah, you showed up just in time.
[152:57.64]I was doing things.
[152:58.40]This is a very long range weapon.
[153:00.74]Hey, you want to get in the bike?
[153:02.81]Wanna get on the bike that takes like 30 seconds to get here?
[153:06.65]And then we'll drive it.
[153:07.59]Wanna drive the bike on the road?
[153:09.31]How about you play something else?
[153:13.42]No!
[153:13.64]Like the ranger was fun, right?
[153:17.84]Alright, I wanna prove... How about you play slow as fuck flanker?
[153:20.16]I need to prove... Play flanker.
[153:21.72]That I'm not stupid.
[153:22.72]You know how important this is right now?
[153:24.76]Okay.
[153:25.36]Okay, it's extremely important.
[153:28.54]When this gets here... I'm gonna get in the driver's seat...
[153:32.71]I almost want to turn on a fucking facecam for this.
[153:35.61]Right?
[153:35.83]Okay, here we go.
[153:36.61]I'm not touching any buttons.
[153:39.01]W. That's W. That's W. That's W. You understand that's W?
[153:44.95]W. This is me pressing W. It just, it doesn't want to, it just, this is W. What kind of W is that?
[153:55.53]Why is this place on fire?
[153:57.40]Uh, because the mothership is destroying the whole city while you're driving around in circles.
[154:01.04]Press shift or tab?
[154:04.56]What?
[154:05.52]Tab?
[154:06.02]That doesn't make any sense.
[154:10.56]Remember the joke I was gonna do?
[154:12.20]It was that.
[154:13.88]That was the joke.
[154:14.82]I'm glad it was funny.
[154:16.57]I was moving the mouse, too, without... Holy shit, that's huge.
[154:22.99]Space?
[154:23.41]I was trying a bunch of... You know, you think that... This tapping W would make you go forward.
[154:31.67]There's a brake on?
[154:33.97]No other vehicle has done that to me.
[154:35.47]I don't know why it would start happening now.
[154:41.61]It's just cheap, that's the problem.
[154:43.01]Well, whatever.
[154:49.23]It's just like Independence Day.
[154:52.21]Alright, ready?
[154:58.37]Attack wheel.
[154:59.88]Check this.
[155:02.02]It's gonna hit it right in the center.
[155:03.74]And we're gonna win.
[155:09.57]Where did it go?
[155:11.61]It just missed.
[155:12.67]No, it didn't.
[155:13.11]Look at that.
[155:13.73]Now they're like, oh shit, he's using the wheel.
[155:15.45]We gotta close our fucking wine opener.
[155:19.44]Oh no, get us out quick.
[155:21.18]Oh fuck, hold on.
[155:21.76]This is not good.
[155:37.98]I'm just doing chores.
[155:56.32]Yeah, how do we destroy these?
[155:57.52]Can they be destroyed?
[156:05.46]I'm being surrounded here.
[156:06.30]This is not good.
[156:13.10]Got the wheel?
[156:16.57]Shit, I'm in trouble over here.
[156:22.91]Big trouble over here.
[156:24.49]Big trouble.
[156:25.29]Where are you now?
[156:29.27]Oh, well, bad, bad, bad, bad news.
[156:44.64]Time to do the whale?
[156:45.24]Nah, I'll kill myself with the whale.
[156:58.27]You wanna use the fucking whale?
[157:05.10]Come on a rez here.
[157:06.60]Yeah, come help me.
[157:09.09]This character has nothing that can do... The only thing I have is the whale that does damage, and it just kills me.
[157:16.49]This litbit sniper is fucking awful.
[157:20.38]I can only shoot two out at a time, and it maybe will kill one thing with a, like, four second reload.
[157:31.18]Oh.
[157:32.55]Yeah.
[157:36.37]That's all I can do.
[157:39.93]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[157:41.21]Someone's playing Starcraft over here.
[157:43.77]I'm going to need your help, Jerma.
[157:45.66]I would love to do that.
[157:47.72]I would seriously love it.
[157:52.00]Take all these Aussie bits.
[157:53.88]Thanks a lot, man.
[157:54.46]I appreciate it.
[157:58.21]I wish I had a bike that could drive fast to get to the mothership.
[158:03.59]Oh, God.
[158:05.01]Alright, hold on.
[158:06.57]I got this.
[158:10.05]Watch out, watch out, watch out!
[158:10.99]Get out of the way, please!
[158:17.36]Alright, I got someone.
[158:21.32]All I can hope for is to attach this shit to one person and blow it up.
[158:25.83]I'm actually really going to need help.
[158:31.84]I can't fight these guys close range, and that's like the whole thing.
[158:35.21]If I just put two of these on them, I can do it, but... Like, this guy sucks so bad, there's no way I'll be able to kill anything.
[158:42.15]I'll be able to kill one every, like, eight seconds.
[158:46.18]That's how it's working.
[158:51.90]As long as you guys... I can long range them.
[158:53.10]What level were your weapons?
[158:54.94]Twelve and, like, sixteen.
[159:03.69]Nice detonation.
[159:05.01]They're all swarming me right now like fucking bugs.
[159:10.31]Like giant insects.
[159:12.30]Yeah, like insects.
[159:15.78]Oh no, he's going to pick me up in his fucking seat mouth.
[159:22.24]Alright, I got two.
[159:22.83]No, I'm going to be honest here.
[159:28.89]I've been doing some work for the last couple of minutes.
[159:30.85]I swear to God, I promise you.
[159:35.77]I'm gonna die.
[159:37.17]Oh, I can't die this far away from you either.
[159:39.59]We'll take you a millennia to walk here.
[159:41.74]Fly to me as fast as you can.
[159:42.86]Is that guy still alive?
[159:45.44]I can't even see.
[159:46.76]There's a giant explosion.
[159:51.99]Didn't hit him.
[159:52.47]Fuck.
[159:56.05]Oh, shit.
[159:58.73]Mmm.
[160:05.70]Oh, fuck.
[160:05.94]There's only two more left.
[160:12.50]There we go.
[160:13.08]Alright.
[160:15.02]I... Oh, my.
[160:16.68]I really turned it on in the end there.
[160:18.54]I turned it up.
[160:21.20]Maybe we picked up accidentally one item.
[160:26.93]Thank God.
[160:27.41]Alright.
[160:28.41]Some of these are level, like, 22.
[160:33.84]Charma.
[160:35.16]I need you.
[160:36.80]What, you're gonna get me now?
[160:37.48]Oh, it's because your Limpet Sniper is level 12.
[160:40.23]That's not... Don't make fun of my limp.
[160:42.71]Don't make fun of my limp rifle like that.
[160:45.83]Get rid of that fucking bike.
[160:48.45]Don't you talk about my limp rifle like that.
[160:51.41]I'm done.
[160:51.87]I'm talking about the bike now.
[160:52.99]How big is your limp rifle?
[160:54.23]16.
[160:55.77]It's definitely not 12 inches.
[161:00.43]Okay.
[161:01.89]This thing sucks.
[161:04.57]stationary weapons hold on a minute give me a second I want time to read zero gun no this is 21. an upgraded y10 impulse mine I don't care why it doesn't let you find weapons for other classes yeah me either
[161:32.08]What complicated?
[161:33.00]I know.
[161:33.50]Well, this thing's level 21.
[161:34.66]Might as well put it on.
[161:37.34]22... I mean, I could just be Mr. Support.
[161:42.05]All I have is this stupid fucking Limpet Launcher.
[161:47.89]I could do two huge explosions.
[161:52.34]Go for it.
[161:52.86]Just be AOE guy, and I'll be Dasher on Clean Up guy.
[161:57.10]Maybe I'll do Zero Gun, too.
[161:58.32]Get rid of this stupid bike.
[162:01.80]Neagling self-propelled rocket XM for a vehicle.
[162:10.18]What the hell does that mean?
[162:11.70]We're gonna try it.
[162:13.42]The mine is useless?
[162:20.61]Is it really?
[162:21.05]It's level 21 though.
[162:22.15]It's like the only thing I really have that's any good.
[162:25.17]What about Sprite Ball?
[162:32.03]Okay.
[162:32.89]Just be useless, guy.
[162:34.84]No, I don't want to be useless guy again.
[162:37.74]Use the power suits?
[162:41.43]Power suits?
[162:41.99]What are you talking about?
[162:45.38]No, I don't want to do the power suit guy.
[162:46.80]I want to do this awful shitty support, kill all your friends in the game accidentally huge nuke guy that sucks.
[162:54.00]That is very you.
[162:56.85]Let's just give it a go.
[162:57.51]Let's go.
[162:58.89]I mean, if any, if worst case scenario, I'll beat the mission for you.
[163:04.83]Yeah, that's true.
[163:07.13]The mothership is launching flying drones.
[163:08.99]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[163:09.69]Let's just see.
[163:10.33]Your weapon 2 now is level 11.
[163:12.51]Power?
[163:12.95]Wait.
[163:13.93]Your Zergu or something?
[163:16.91]It's a vehicle?
[163:20.03]I want to try this one.
[163:24.92]I don't want to do the power armor thing.
[163:27.26]I want to do this first.
[163:28.48]There's a bunch of options.
[163:29.38]Let me do my options.
[163:31.32]No, you're doing it wrong, streamer.
[163:33.02]Have fun the way I would have fun.
[163:39.12]Alright, let me see what this thing does.
[163:40.12]Alright, they're like claymores.
[163:44.27]Don't step on those.
[163:46.45]Ooh, I want to.
[163:47.63]Oh, okay, I can reload them.
[163:50.63]They can be reloaded.
[163:51.49]Alright, what is this one?
[163:52.29]Self-propelling rocket?
[163:55.55]We're all going to die, but I want to see what this does.
[163:57.97]I need to know.
[163:58.41]I'm curious.
[163:59.17]By all going to die, do you mean like I'm going to kill everything?
[164:03.03]Oh, these are like sentry guns.
[164:07.73]Ooh, these things are probably going to be pretty cool.
[164:11.56]You have claymores against the flying things?
[164:15.20]No, no, no.
[164:16.18]I deleted them.
[164:17.92]Do I have to do something else to these?
[164:20.55]Well, I know, but I just mean in general, you brought claymores to this fight.
[164:30.06]How come I don't understand what that was?
[164:36.14]Okay.
[164:38.11]Why did the sentries not build?
[164:40.51]I'm sort of confused, but whatever.
[164:43.35]Dude, alright.
[164:44.41]Oh, y'all thought I was bad, huh?
[164:47.13]Y'all thought I was, like, terrible?
[164:49.95]Says the guy that's got the fucking V2 red alert rocket.
[164:56.01]This thing's awesome.
[164:57.85]This is perfect for this mission.
[165:04.33]It's fucking causing chaos.
[165:06.75]I really, really, really, really wish in this game there was a, like, kill count at the end for each of us.
[165:14.20]That's all I want.
[165:15.90]I just, I don't understand what these things do.
[165:17.88]Like, how do I... Okay, now they want to activate.
[165:22.72]These things are awesome.
[165:23.40]Alright, now it's right-click to activate them.
[165:25.27]I didn't know that.
[165:31.45]I was gonna stay alive and these things will do my work for me.
[165:38.12]Yeah, it's a good thing I have the mines for the... Somebody's going to accidentally step on those.
[165:41.73]Just reload them so they don't fucking kill anybody.
[165:43.65]Can you guys see how many air shots I'm getting?
[165:52.63]What is that?
[165:53.86]I can almost do my V2 rocket again.
[165:59.96]There's a lot of boxes around too.
[166:16.30]It's the enemy!
[166:22.20]Yeah, I feel like this guy's not that great.
[166:26.52]You play air girl, and I'll play that guy.
[166:32.46]Everything I have has only got reload right now.
[166:39.43]Yeah, man.
[166:44.96]You know what, I feel like this character is, if you play with like four people.
[166:50.75]Reload the character.
[166:51.61]Yeah, actually, yeah, hold on.
[166:53.43]Can we restart?
[166:54.49]Because I want to get rid of some stuff.
[166:55.81]Because this is like useless.
[166:57.07]Do it.
[166:59.41]This character is like 100% useless.
[167:02.37]In fact, this class seems 100% useless.
[167:06.89]Are we going to run like mission two again real quick for you?
[167:09.38]To switch characters?
[167:10.22]No, no, no.
[167:15.69]Melt Buster?
[167:16.49]What is Melt Buster?
[167:18.77]This chat is going to go crazy if you don't try the mech before you quit it.
[167:23.74]They're actually going to die.
[167:25.82]They'll be fine.
[167:30.44]Alright, Power Suits.
[167:31.56]Alright, Vegeta Heavy Cannon.
[167:34.78]Should I put on the Vegeta Heavy Cannon?
[167:36.07]I kind of like these, though.
[167:43.23]Yeah, we'll go with just the regular Linted Launcher.
[167:48.26]Alright, so you're telling me if I get inside this?
[167:51.02]You want me to do the Depth Crawler or the Vigelta?
[167:55.12]Which one of these power suits is better?
[167:57.18]Which one's higher level?
[167:58.44]Well, this one is, obviously.
[168:00.30]Take that one.
[168:02.28]I'm going to use my regular launcher, the turrets.
[168:07.06]Let's give it a try.
[168:16.08]Vigelta.
[168:23.02]You were just saying you hate it, don't say you love it.
[168:29.64]I believe in you.
[168:31.09]The Zergun is terrible.
[168:33.45]Well, yeah, your Zergun's level 11.
[168:34.99]Yeah, but I mean, it's... Use middle mouse button to fly?
[168:39.95]Alright, let's see.
[168:43.89]Vigelta Heavy Cannon.
[168:47.81]Okay, let's see what it does.
[168:51.23]Let's get an R for Vigelta.
[169:00.00]I thought that scream was you dying.
[169:03.24]Wouldn't that have been something?
[169:08.63]Middle mouse is not doing anything for me right now.
[169:11.39]When you're in the mech, I assume you're talking about... Oh my god!
[169:17.27]Holy shit!
[169:18.38]Okay, this character is fucking amazing!
[169:20.00]And you weren't gonna pick it.
[169:22.10]What is happening?
[169:26.88]What did I... This just turned into MechWarrior.
[169:34.01]It's really slow though.
[169:35.77]That's the only problem.
[169:37.68]Who cares?
[169:38.20]It's fucking awesome.
[169:41.14]Like it's hard to aim this shit.
[169:45.12]Why do you have to play the cool classes?
[169:47.14]Holding middle mouse and like left and right mouse doesn't really work that well.
[170:03.17]Okay, I'd rather just stay stationary.
[170:07.49]I can't... Revolver cannon?
[170:08.80]How do I do that?
[170:11.98]Holy shit.
[170:12.30]Do you have a 1 and 2 to switch weapons?
[170:13.90]No.
[170:15.06]Shift.
[170:19.04]My goodness.
[170:21.26]It's like kind of a slug, but it's really, really powerful.
[170:27.39]Well, there it goes.
[170:32.07]That thing is pretty cool.
[170:46.77]That was like a quadruple kill right there.
[170:51.52]Damn it.
[170:51.98]Damn it.
[170:52.48]Damn it.
[170:52.86]Damn it.
[170:53.54]I gotta get under the bridge.
[170:55.80]Yeah, under the bridge is... What the fuck?
[171:00.84]The mothership shoots down.
[171:01.88]Okay, my hands are in the air because I thought I did something bad.
[171:04.62]No, the mothership just blew everything up.
[171:09.86]That's fine.
[171:10.20]Let's go back to the lobby for a second because I want to change a weapon out.
[171:12.74]Okay.
[171:18.22]Choose a class.
[171:19.60]Wing Diver.
[171:20.82]Ranger.
[171:23.20]Choose loadout.
[171:24.56]Rangers can equip two weapons.
[171:33.93]Recycler.
[171:36.87]No, what is the... This thing.
[171:42.05]That's probably not even that good.
[171:52.82]You ready?
[171:54.82]Yeah.
[171:55.90]Try this.
[171:58.65]Mech is boring.
[171:59.67]It's just hard to control.
[172:00.45]It's just slow.
[172:02.57]I feel like in a place where there's not constantly these huge mech things surrounding you.
[172:09.46]Use the lock on wrong.
[172:10.04]This mission is kind of a fuck fest.
[172:12.56]Is there like a telegraph on the ground?
[172:16.24]Telegraph?
[172:16.70]I didn't write one.
[172:18.74]No, like when the mothership shoots.
[172:22.19]I don't think so.
[172:22.77]But she shoots out there and I was just way in the back last time and didn't hit either of us because you were standing around doing nothing.
[172:29.33]Well, I will do things now.
[172:34.96]Yeah, just don't walk forward under the bridges.
[172:37.06]Let's stay behind these buildings back here and try and funnel them into the building choke.
[172:43.55]Sounds like a plan.
[172:44.37]Yeah, now is not the time for a class experimentation.
[173:00.92]We need to get kills.
[173:09.25]Didn't yeah, I changed classes.
[173:10.53]I'm not playing the weird support dude anymore.
[173:14.47]No, what are you playing this back to Ranger?
[173:19.79]Did you even have good weapons on Ranger?
[173:21.47]Yep Somebody help me
[173:36.40]I hate the way they spin.
[173:37.72]They're such goofy mechs.
[173:51.53]I don't wanna die.
[173:54.19]Please.
[173:54.77]Alright, the mothership is fucking moving down here.
[174:02.17]Retreat.
[174:02.67]I don't know how wide of an area that is.
[174:10.01]Hopefully it's not this big.
[174:17.66]God, I'm so scared that it's going to still hit us.
[174:23.28]We're such wusses.
[174:24.28]We're just going so far back.
[174:26.62]We're at the edge of the map right now.
[174:29.72]Did it shoot?
[174:31.12]I think so.
[174:33.38]No, it didn't.
[174:34.64]It's shooting now.
[174:37.61]Wow.
[174:38.01]Wow.
[174:39.98]There you go.
[174:42.12]That's what killed us.
[174:44.89]Look at how many more units are here.
[174:54.73]Call of Duty.
[174:58.01]Alright, come back to near me.
[174:59.77]Let's stay together.
[175:00.53]This would be bad if we split up.
[175:01.89]Damn it.
[175:03.97]I keep throwing this anti-air grenade and it's going through the ground and not doing anything.
[175:15.55]Wow, they all just came over here.
[175:17.35]Holy shit.
[175:23.39]This is not good.
[175:25.89]I'm gonna die.
[175:35.46]Holy shit.
[175:37.92]I can't sustain shooting at them long enough because I run out of energy.
[175:42.31]Are you dead?
[175:43.45]Yep.
[175:43.99]Look at the mini-map.
[175:44.99]Yeah.
[175:45.55]This is crazy.
[175:47.05]This is so many people.
[175:52.25]There's like 200 enemies on the screen.
[175:55.45]I can't shoot fast enough.
[175:59.19]I have a weapon, I think.
[176:00.35]It's not high level, but it's good.
[176:02.87]Can we do a mission 2 run real fast?
[176:06.80]A good old mission 2.
[176:09.00]Yeah.
[176:10.20]On hard?
[176:11.58]Yeah.
[176:16.30]Just a grind run?
[176:18.45]Yeah.
[176:19.07]Because I don't think the wing diver stuff I have is... I can't shoot enough.
[176:24.27]Do the other mech suit.
[176:30.39]Mech, mech, mech, mech, mech, mech.
[176:34.44]Bring something that can actually kill things.
[176:36.14]Yeah, I want to... We have to be Ranger Boy, because Ranger Boy actually can get kills for me.
[176:43.27]Can you hear me?
[176:45.67]Okay, I'm muted.
[176:46.13]Good.
[176:47.77]Thank you to JGus88.
[176:48.95]Oh, hey, JGus.
[176:51.07]How's life treating you?
[176:53.75]Good to see you again.
[176:55.71]Lit.
[176:57.48]Thanks for the two months in a row, dude.
[176:59.82]A wizard, 13 months.
[177:01.82]There are not enough wizards in your mod party.
[177:04.32]That is true.
[177:06.36]Dog to go.
[177:07.46]Pinkato a memes core monster, and I'll get the rest in a few minutes after we do this Forgive me Yeah, you've got to go back to mission 2 we got to get better weapons I couldn't hear you if you're saying something.
[177:33.62]I'm here now, right?
[177:36.78]I'm here now?
[177:38.04]Yep.
[177:38.36]Good.
[177:45.76]Actually, this isn't even worth it.
[177:46.76]I'm gonna get, like, a level 10 weapon.
[177:48.72]No, it's just... I got, like, a level 18 from here, I think.
[177:55.27]From what I remember.
[177:57.79]What are you playing as?
[178:06.67]ranger ranger has like the good direct hit things damage moves direct damage like I was doing really good damage to the drones but they're spawning faster than I can shoot because I like everyone's small like oh I have to wait back for my energy to recharge and then next time I come around the corner there's 10 more of them
[178:33.82]This shotgun is disgusting too.
[178:36.58]It's so far.
[178:37.36]I can shoot across the whole map.
[178:39.95]The G3.
[178:40.31]But you also get to have the fun job to run everywhere.
[178:44.83]Mm-hmm.
[178:53.94]If only we had someone with like a car we could drive in.
[178:57.54]The thing that before I started streaming, like people that have played this game a lot said that you'd have to kind of grind old levels to get better stuff and to get better armor and stuff like that.
[179:09.47]So I think that the level we were currently on was way over our current heads, I think.
[179:14.61]Okay.
[179:26.47]Someone just give me a TLDR, like, of this game?
[179:31.08]Shoot bugs.
[179:31.86]Shoot the bugs.
[179:33.74]That's pretty much it.
[179:41.80]That is such a long range.
[179:43.16]This is the same stir from Overwatch?
[179:46.56]Uh, is it?
[179:50.43]That sounds adorable.
[179:59.72]Dude, I'm gonna just keep- fuck this rocket launcher, this thing is ten times better.
[180:02.74]It can hit more than one person, it's like almost an instant kill with one hit.
[180:06.77]What the hell are they?
[180:14.17]Where are they, he says, as they're surrounding every second of him.
[180:17.83]Every second of his life.
[180:20.99]This one in the middle is freaking the fuck out.
[180:26.37]I picked up at least one weapon.
[180:29.19]Ooh, one weapon.
[180:30.15]I picked up at least like two now.
[180:38.61]Reminds me of starting Ranger Warriors.
[180:39.98]Eh, it does a little bit.
[180:42.80]Kinda does.
[180:43.50]I can see that.
[180:44.18]I haven't really played one before though.
[180:46.80]You've never played Dynasty Warriors?
[180:49.25]oh man those games are fucking awesome well not a lot of them were on steam or a pc or anything yeah but here's the thing they made like 12 of them yeah and they had two good ones yeah there's like two ones that are actually fun the rest are just the same game over and over again like but not as good you're writing a final paper dive beetles that's doing two hours while watching please give me strength
[181:19.41]How do I give him strength?
[181:23.27]Give him strength already.
[181:24.82]Chat, can we give him some strength, please?
[181:30.44]I got it.
[181:30.80]Oh yeah, I got a level 20.
[181:34.40]That's new.
[181:36.44]Level 17, MF4, 42, MF... A couple of M's and a 40.
[181:37.56]A couple M's?
[181:47.57]Okay, if I'm going to replace something, it's going to be this.
[181:51.09]MMF42.
[181:54.19]Sniper rifle.
[181:56.20]Ooh.
[181:58.64]I think I might have gotten the weapons you got.
[182:00.52]I don't know.
[182:03.34]That might be good here.
[182:07.30]Drink some more water.
[182:09.74]You can never drink enough water, man.
[182:12.39]Yeah, I pretty much have two weapons I can use.
[182:15.81]You want to do it again?
[182:17.88]Uh... Go forward again.
[182:23.16]Oh, and the armor that you get is only applied to the class you got it on.
[182:27.47]It seems like.
[182:28.75]Maybe I'm crazy.
[182:30.69]If that's the case, then that would make more sense as to why we died instantly when we were playing the different characters.
[182:37.49]Why would you shoot a bug with a sniper?
[182:39.37]Because they're huge!
[182:40.29]Oh yeah, I got the shotgun that you got.
[182:44.62]The G3?
[182:44.78]Yep.
[182:46.88]Oh yeah, the thing's amazing.
[182:47.90]Let's just run one other mission.
[182:49.12]I want to see what these weapons even do.
[182:52.36]And then maybe we can go try and fight the entire skybox.
[182:57.05]Also, I did have one of those bouncy grenades that only shoots up, so it's supposed to destroy things in the air.
[183:03.29]But every time I threw it, it fell to the ground.
[183:05.07]Let's just do three.
[183:06.27]Deploying.
[183:18.89]Snipers destroy tanks.
[183:28.50]You're using the one-shot sniper rifle, by the way.
[183:31.20]I only have two weapons that are above level 10, so I picked those.
[183:35.48]Make sure you use that one shot wisely.
[183:39.46]Oh, that's the... Yeah, that's the I get to shoot the gun one time and then it melts.
[183:46.80]Oh, shit.
[183:49.03]Oh, yeah.
[183:54.75]Does it pierce targets or anything?
[183:56.89]I have no idea.
[183:57.57]Okay.
[184:00.92]Yes, sir!
[184:06.99]Okay, this thing doesn't seem like it's doing very much damage.
[184:12.01]It's a sniper rifle, but, like, kind of sucked.
[184:16.45]It's not an instant kill, it seems.
[184:19.87]Two shots to kill one of these shitty gray ants?
[184:21.91]It's level 17.
[184:22.73]Oh, this shotgun is really good.
[184:28.92]Yeah, this thing is... Dude, look, okay, look at how far away I am shooting these guys with the G3.
[184:34.04]I have the same one as you.
[184:35.18]Yeah.
[184:37.21]I'm sniping guys with a sniper rifle that's level 17, and it takes two shots from that far away to kill.
[184:42.63]From this far away, with the fucking shotgun, I killed him in less time.
[184:48.45]Okay, can we exit out of this so I can have a second gun?
[184:52.55]All you need is the shotgun here, man.
[184:54.93]This is like level 3.
[184:55.59]We're gonna just blow through this.
[184:59.14]Not worth like seeing the loading screen again.
[185:01.54]Just pick up the armor and shit.
[185:02.88]I kind of wanted to do it as artillery person.
[185:05.04]See if I get something for them because they seem... We'll do it again.
[185:10.31]We'll do it again.
[185:10.71]Okay, we'll do a mission two.
[185:13.41]Yeah, just do a quick mission two.
[185:16.77]Hey, you help you guys in the stream signed up for this.
[185:18.53]We're doing like redoing mission two seven times.
[185:21.08]Hey, don't even worry about it.
[185:24.24]People watch speedruns.
[185:28.94]Super House of Dungeons?
[185:30.00]Dungeons?
[185:30.40]Great game.
[185:30.96]Great game.
[185:32.14]This thing... This thing sucks.
[185:34.08]Am I... Chad, am I doing something wrong here?
[185:35.84]Or does this thing just suck, asshole?
[185:43.19]Like, why would I do that when I can just do this?
[185:57.99]Authentic EDF experience.
[185:59.27]You have to replay the same missions ten times.
[186:08.04]Don't scare me like that.
[186:08.84]Is that thing alive?
[186:10.60]What the fuck?
[186:12.30]It was, wasn't it?
[186:13.60]That was weird.
[186:15.56]Yeah, this shotgun sniper.
[186:26.78]See ya.
[186:30.92]Wouldn't want to be ya.
[186:32.22]Ha ha ha.
[186:33.10]Alright, any boxes?
[186:33.90]That we missed besides these ones?
[186:43.81]The same... Yeah, this is the same scream every two seconds.
[186:48.21]Yeah, I think... Is that it?
[186:54.56]Or is there one more?
[186:55.12]Guy in the back.
[187:01.65]There's one more thing to run.
[187:03.29]Yep.
[187:05.65]Have we seen one green box?
[187:09.67]Maybe one.
[187:10.17]At least one.
[187:11.49]Like.
[187:36.09]We need a wing diver, Star.
[187:37.03]You're not a wing diver.
[187:38.71]I know.
[187:39.03]I know.
[187:43.71]Never did they say, we need rangers.
[187:46.95]Get those rangers in there, please.
[187:48.15]We need more of those rangers.
[187:52.85]The fencer is really good.
[187:53.92]Too slow.
[187:57.88]I...
[187:58.91]Maybe it will be just with different items or something.
[188:01.49]I Depending on what weapons he has later.
[188:03.51]It could be fun for me.
[188:04.43]But like the gatling guns he started with word It was not fun at all I Know he gets like as a little loading screens.
[188:15.88]He has like an axe which seems really cool The fencer is hot garbage Let's see.
[188:26.48]We got some mixed
[188:31.89]I'd rather go fast than be good.
[188:34.86]Miss any boxes?
[188:36.40]Usually being slow means you're bad.
[188:38.54]Oh, there's a box on this roof.
[188:39.68]We'll never get it.
[188:40.74]No, we're not wingers.
[188:44.06]Fencer has a dash?
[188:45.28]Yeah.
[188:46.58]The Fencer starting weapons are complete garbage.
[188:51.34]Maybe it'd be worth it if we just... I was going to say, just play the Fencer and just do Mission 1.
[188:56.14]And just see what we get.
[188:59.27]See if we get something good.
[189:04.28]My frame rate just tanked because somebody knocked down all these trees.
[189:17.48]Somebody help me!
[189:23.37]Dude, if you guys think this is bad, dude, you should try fighting a titan.
[189:28.89]Yeah, are we talking like titanfall or attack on titanfall?
[189:31.49]Attack on- you should fight a titan.
[189:35.81]Where's this one ant?
[189:40.26]Over here, apparently.
[189:42.80]Come here, stop running away from me!
[189:44.02]I'm just hanging out on a roof, fuck off.
[189:48.80]I bet you guys have never fought a Titan.
[189:51.28]This game on console gets 5 FPS.
[189:53.86]I could imagine it probably does, just because of the... so many enemies on screen.
[190:00.97]Skeet shooting.
[190:04.88]Do I still have a GTX 780?
[190:06.32]Of course I do.
[190:06.92]I'm not getting a new computer till, like, January.
[190:14.12]Jerma likes to keep it old school.
[190:16.39]Yeah, good old GTX.
[190:24.53]That's what I like about Jerma.
[190:26.09]What?
[190:27.15]Keeps it old school.
[190:29.86]Like, you guys are all like, oh, check out my iPhone.
[190:31.86]He fucking, he, like, has to go to, like, find a payphone.
[190:36.29]Holy shit, I just instantly... Ow.
[190:49.06]That's what you get for talking shit about me.
[190:50.88]Oh, there we go.
[190:57.22]Oh hey, the level 18 I got, Nova Buster.
[191:03.06]These are all new, but they're all so shitty.
[191:07.35]AF 16 RA.
[191:08.13]Let's see what that one is.
[191:10.65]It's a level 16, but... This thing is terrible, that's for certain.
[191:22.76]Improve rate of fire.
[191:26.62]So this thing does more damage, but... How much damage?
[191:31.16]12, 23.
[191:31.28]Hmm...
[191:36.80]A plus accuracy.
[191:37.84]That's apparently his new grenade launcher.
[191:47.59]Why does this have to be so low?
[191:53.37]Stingray M2 is just level 20.
[191:54.81]It's just too good to get rid of.
[192:02.79]What if I just had two of these shotguns?
[192:05.04]No, that's stupid.
[192:09.04]Are we going to do it again?
[192:11.72]Or are we going to try it again?
[192:16.89]I want to try and take Fencer through level two real fast and just see what they actually have.
[192:24.23]If we can get something better or different.
[192:27.82]Okay, this is deflection shield.
[192:29.76]Let's just, whatever this shit is, it doesn't even matter.
[192:34.35]It's going to get replaced anyways.
[192:35.65]We'll just do mission.
[192:36.81]Well, you can put two Gatling guns on.
[192:38.73]You want to do mission one or mission two?
[192:41.05]Two.
[192:42.44]Two is like a lot shorter than one it seems as well.
[192:44.68]All right.
[192:45.16]Let's see if we can get something.
[192:48.34]You just get to shoot into a pile.
[192:49.64]That mech does seem fun though.
[192:56.03]It's just slow.
[192:59.59]It doesn't matter.
[193:00.13]You don't have to go anywhere on some missions.
[193:02.07]Yeah, that's true.
[193:03.93]These guys might actually be really good on that mission we're trying to do.
[193:06.85]Just because they can stand still and fire a thousand miles per hour.
[193:12.93]Oh, fuck.
[193:13.35]I didn't add the German 95 channel color scheme.
[193:20.14]All right, butthole spear.
[193:25.94]Oh, I don't have the dash.
[193:30.40]I have the frog jump.
[193:33.37]How do dash cancel?
[193:35.73]Dash, dash cancel?
[193:37.11]I'm just shooting civilians.
[193:44.66]Am I advanced enough to play fencer?
[193:46.22]Yeah.
[193:51.22]Oh look, that's kind of advanced.
[193:53.48]Advanced shooting on the roof.
[193:56.64]Oh, no!
[193:58.04]Destroy this building, quick.
[193:59.44]The one to the right.
[194:00.12]Just blow this fucking thing to hell.
[194:01.42]There's a weapon right there.
[194:09.30]We gotta get this building down somehow.
[194:15.17]There is a weapon on this little shelf here.
[194:22.41]Well, how do you bash with the shield?
[194:26.98]Uh, shift?
[194:28.90]I really have no idea what the hell it does though.
[194:35.61]Oh, I see.
[194:36.31]It keeps your momentum if you dash like that.
[194:39.83]So he's actually faster than the ranger.
[194:47.01]He's a lot, actually we've got like a bunch of weapons that dropped right now.
[194:52.19]Shield bass will cancel the animation at the end of you dash, letting you spam it.
[194:55.72]Yeah.
[194:57.26]I'm doing it.
[194:57.86]It's pretty cool actually.
[195:04.02]You picking up the boxes?
[195:04.74]Well, just on that alone I might play fencer now.
[195:08.48]So what is the Blasthole Spear?
[195:10.40]Blasthole Spear.
[195:12.56]Asshole Spear?
[195:15.30]It just says single target.
[195:17.78]It's kind of like the shotgun book.
[195:27.08]Oh, I died.
[195:28.00]You died?
[195:29.16]Yeah, I was, I was, yeah.
[195:36.14]Let's try the asshole spear again.
[195:37.34]Oh no, no, no.
[195:48.98]I dashed over you.
[195:50.04]I don't know what did I... Did I just knock you out?
[195:55.64]Did we miss any box?
[195:56.50]Get that box!
[196:06.45]Now I see how it works.
[196:14.68]That is kind of insane, that you can just do that.
[196:21.52]Yeah, that makes some... fun.
[196:23.88]But you have to have the shield to do that, I'm assuming, right?
[196:26.78]Oh my god.
[196:27.66]You died again?
[196:29.84]Oh, you're really gonna make this fucking hard for me, dude!
[196:38.89]No it isn't.
[196:41.23]I'm still alive.
[196:47.55]I didn't get any health kits.
[196:48.63]None of the health kits dropped from that last fight.
[196:50.64]You're gonna have to give me a second.
[196:55.88]EDF!
[196:56.42]EDF!
[197:10.47]I wish this guy would get out of the way.
[197:11.89]He's like walking right in the fucking way.
[197:21.85]Okay.
[197:23.65]People are chanting EDF in the chat.
[197:25.73]EDF.
[197:26.83]EDF.
[197:27.91]Green box left.
[197:28.59]I got it.
[197:29.95]Oh, you got it good.
[197:32.15]We're getting too many weapons.
[197:33.67]Not enough health.
[197:40.75]The asshole spear actually is kind of good.
[197:43.19]You can hit it.
[197:44.29]It's just... Okay, what?
[197:45.27]Did you just kill me?
[197:46.65]Fucking god.
[197:47.25]You just shot me right in the fucking head, didn't you?
[197:49.44]I shot you with the spear.
[197:55.94]Hey, thank you Lunar Days for the subscription.
[198:00.50]Cyrus... Oh, I thought you were resuming.
[198:02.12]Cyrus Dexter, thanks for the bits.
[198:04.68]Thanks for the bits, Yellowbelly.
[198:05.62]Thanks for the bits, everybody.
[198:08.77]You guys are, you guys are being bit heroes right now.
[198:14.88]Dying at level two.
[198:15.68]Come on, we're on hard difficulty.
[198:16.84]This ain't on normal.
[198:17.56]This ain't on easy.
[198:18.44]With level zero weapons.
[198:19.74]Level zero weapons, hard difficulty.
[198:21.36]Come on.
[198:23.78]I can just watch Star get his ass kicked now.
[198:34.29]There are so many health packs right here, though.
[198:37.17]If you just dash the hell in here, you would probably get full health.
[198:41.66]There's like a medium pack, there's a small pack just sitting right next to my body.
[198:46.40]They're all sprinting at you now.
[198:48.10]You're in deep shit.
[198:53.51]I'm glad it's hard to walk through double gatling gun.
[198:55.75]Oh, and they spawned a health pack here.
[199:04.79]They're almost all dead.
[199:12.73]They just go, where's the leader?
[199:14.17]Alright, you're good.
[199:27.14]Make sure you get that.
[199:28.41]There's one more wave, right?
[199:29.85]Or is that it?
[199:30.51]There's like at least two weapon crates up here, I think.
[199:35.44]There's a bunch back here.
[199:36.44]Yeah, do not kill that last snake.
[199:39.28]Bug.
[199:41.12]Don't kill the last snake, Star.
[199:42.66]Whatever you do.
[199:44.40]Okay.
[199:50.83]That looks so dumb.
[200:01.27]Alright, we got him.
[200:07.59]Alright.
[200:11.19]One more.
[200:11.55]We got so many weapons.
[200:12.91]I know.
[200:13.15]We really did.
[200:19.41]Is that it?
[200:22.42]We get it all?
[200:28.94]I think that's it.
[200:30.28]That's it.
[200:31.96]Don't do that.
[200:32.46]You could have just killed us both right there.
[200:42.24]Haha, I did it first.
[200:43.41]I win.
[200:44.31]Yeah, you did it first.
[200:45.05]You win.
[200:46.51]Pretty good for a level 0.
[200:47.77]Oh, apparently.
[200:49.69]Oh, I got 21, 20, 20.
[200:50.41]That's a big haul.
[200:52.51]I got the dynamo blade.
[200:54.01]There's too many things to look at here.
[200:56.02]I got, yeah, two dynamo blades.
[200:57.80]I think I'm going to do double dynamo blade.
[200:59.98]What do you think?
[201:00.38]That sounds awesome.
[201:04.06]Do you need, like, a shield, though?
[201:05.58]I don't think so.
[201:06.94]You probably do.
[201:08.82]To do the dash.
[201:09.74]And then, if I'm not doing the dash, character sucks, game sucks.
[201:12.68]Okay, force blade.
[201:13.70]There's a dynamo blade.
[201:15.97]You get a mortar.
[201:16.73]Okay, right hand.
[201:21.65]Power shield.
[201:23.09]Javelin catapult.
[201:26.21]High altitude impact launcher.
[201:30.50]Lightweight cannon.
[201:33.14]Ugh, this...
[201:36.37]Shield, or Dynamo Blade.
[201:37.87]Yeah, we're gonna do Dynamo Blade, Dynamo Blade.
[201:41.07]We'll take Dynamo Blade off this one, and we'll do, uh, Hadouken.
[201:44.19]Whatever this is.
[201:45.65]Special Hammer?
[201:47.96]Tower Shield.
[201:56.76]I think I was gonna do the Gatling Gun again.
[201:58.50]So it's Gatling Gun, and I just have much better shit now.
[202:00.90]Alright.
[202:07.13]I mean, honestly, I have better items now than any of the other characters.
[202:10.81]I have, like, level 21.
[202:11.37]That was... I know, that was ridiculous.
[202:14.29]No shield?
[202:14.79]I'm not... Let's just try double dynamo.
[202:17.53]Two swords.
[202:17.91]Well, then you're never going to get close to anything, unless they all run at you and you just start swinging.
[202:22.20]Well, I mean, is that what it is?
[202:23.54]Is it just, like... Just do a mission 2 again, so it's quick.
[202:26.76]I just want to try the weapons.
[202:27.82]This isn't even, like... It's just... It's over really fast.
[202:33.51]Colors, colors, shit.
[202:36.09]Everyone's so upset that I haven't done my German 985 colors.
[202:39.58]I can't dash cancel anymore.
[202:42.18]Yeah, that kind of sucks, but... Swords against flying enemies?
[202:46.34]Well, we're not doing that mission.
[202:47.76]We just want to try the weapons.
[202:56.80]I am pleasantly surprised by how much I'm enjoying playing this.
[203:00.15]Me too.
[203:00.93]I expected this to be an awful experience.
[203:03.71]Did you really?
[203:04.45]I thought it was going to be good, I didn't think it was going to be fucking terrible.
[203:07.33]Last time we played I had high hopes too and it was not that fun.
[203:11.25]Holy shit.
[203:15.18]That was.
[203:15.54]This is a big can opener.
[203:19.68]This does not look like it's supposed to be this size.
[203:23.64]Okay, you can re-load them.
[203:27.02]This is crazy.
[203:28.10]Oh my goodness.
[203:33.03]Alright, what about this new cannon?
[203:35.37]Oh my goodness, this gun is awesome.
[203:40.29]It's like the artillery you had on the other character, but not stupid.
[203:45.09]Dude, we can just fuck shit up, man.
[203:46.83]Like, we'll just be just standing turrets.
[203:49.89]Just play these two characters.
[203:52.23]And if they get close in, pull out the two fucking Swiss Army knives.
[203:55.51]I just wanna see what it does.
[204:03.85]Okay, I'm kind of like dying here.
[204:08.51]Make sure you pick up those fucking crates.
[204:11.83]Oh boy!
[204:12.37]Whoops.
[204:19.09]Oh no!
[204:21.05]Star shot me again!
[204:24.35]You can charge the melee attacks?
[204:25.77]Alright, that's awesome.
[204:33.65]Yeah, I like the uh, the high altitude impact one Big fan two of those you're walking artillery like your artillery gun As seems completely pointless because this character's in the game Yes
[204:54.03]Alright, I guess you can hold down the button and charge him up.
[204:56.93]Oh, yeah, and it has a charge on the side.
[204:58.25]Holy shit.
[204:59.06]Okay, that's amazing.
[205:00.28]That's awesome.
[205:02.44]That's so cool.
[205:04.48]You mean he can't dodge?
[205:05.76]No, he can't cancel anymore, but... What does the shift actually do besides make you awesome?
[205:14.32]Makes you awesome.
[205:14.92]That's all I need to know.
[205:18.54]Can you charge both swords?
[205:19.70]Oh, dude.
[205:20.88]You can charge both swords at the same time.
[205:24.98]Oh my god!
[205:26.08]You can charge it while dashing too.
[205:27.73]Yeah, but look what happens if you charge both at the same time and you hold it down all the way.
[205:32.39]You do this crazy super double dash move.
[205:38.63]That is pretty awesome.
[205:40.57]That's cool.
[205:42.75]I love how they have ammo.
[205:45.09]That's funny.
[205:50.85]Let's give it a try.
[205:51.51]I'm just going to charge it the hell up and get in there.
[205:56.04]You can dash while charging too.
[205:57.64]Alright, let's just do it!
[205:59.80]I missed everybody.
[206:01.12]I didn't hit one.
[206:01.69]I'm dead.
[206:03.67]Me too.
[206:08.99]Alright, well that's how those things work.
[206:10.91]Yeah, we just wanted to learn.
[206:12.22]We just wanted to learn.
[206:13.10]We were just curious how that worked.
[206:15.46]Give us a break.
[206:19.68]What else is there?
[206:26.41]Alright, definitely these can't.
[206:27.71]I'm going to keep those.
[206:28.75]These are cool, but what else do we have?
[206:32.98]Power shield.
[206:33.66]I'm going to put the shield on.
[206:34.68]Lightweight cannon.
[206:35.16]Can you just do two shields?
[206:36.64]Force blade.
[206:36.98]Javelin catapult.
[206:37.86]I'm just curious what this does.
[206:57.82]colors.
[206:58.50]I can actually make this one.
[207:00.88]Look at that.
[207:01.56]Perfect.
[207:03.16]Oh no, there's... Yeah, there we go.
[207:12.37]Okay, I'm gonna be, um... I'm gonna be useless.
[207:15.57]You're gonna be useless?
[207:16.15]I'm gonna do one-to-one with Air Raider and see what I get.
[207:18.99]Okay.
[207:19.31]And then we can move on with our lives, I think, after this one.
[207:21.49]I think we can move on with our lives.
[207:25.98]I did the colors.
[207:27.59]Yeah, the sword did seem to shoot a projectile.
[207:29.97]Yeah, it does.
[207:34.02]Are you ready?
[207:38.50]Hopefully you can kill everything.
[207:42.04]Javelin catapult plus melee is better.
[207:43.86]Dash cancel?
[207:44.64]Okay, that's cool.
[207:47.08]Oh, that's... Okay.
[207:51.10]Jacket.
[207:51.48]I'm back at my computer.
[207:52.47]I'm ready to ban everyone.
[207:56.77]What's happening?
[207:58.37]You guys are still playing this game?
[207:59.59]Well, I mean, yeah.
[208:02.13]Yeah.
[208:02.99]Yeah, just like Shadow Warrior 2.
[208:06.36]I'm having more fun in this game than I was in Shadow Warrior.
[208:08.96]Actually, yeah.
[208:09.58]Me too.
[208:11.16]Alright, let me see.
[208:11.92]How do I call in... Oh, I see.
[208:19.94]The tower shield has... Okay, I see.
[208:24.38]What?
[208:26.17]Oh my god.
[208:28.87]Are you shitting me?
[208:29.69]That's not really happening, is it?
[208:33.23]It is.
[208:34.45]How can I even tell where these are going?
[208:39.65]I have 300 rounds, but where are they going?
[208:44.29]They're landing in the ants.
[208:45.58]Are they?
[208:46.84]Yeah.
[208:48.16]What if I just got two of these?
[208:51.22]The thing I had, the...
[208:54.73]The air missiles, like it would lock on six times, launch them up in the air and they'd come down like artillery.
[208:59.43]I was gonna put two of them on.
[209:07.08]Are you shitting him?
[209:15.04]So much destruction.
[209:17.20]I don't think I can dash with this on.
[209:27.61]I feel like I can't really tell where these are actually landing.
[209:31.05]Oh, they don't even explode.
[209:32.33]They are seriously just spikes.
[209:37.24]There's a whole bunch of spikes in the side of that building.
[209:39.36]So you just have to rain?
[209:40.44]That's so stupid.
[209:41.44]That's funny.
[209:44.78]They are just exploding behind us.
[209:46.04]Tank man.
[210:00.94]Panicking citizens just run into your line of fire.
[210:02.98]Yeah, I don't know.
[210:03.64]They're pretty dumb.
[210:12.77]I can't really dash with these for some reason.
[210:18.43]When you have two weapons that only shoot you up in the air, you don't dash.
[210:22.43]Use the 30mm heavy cannon instead of the lightweight one.
[210:25.01]Yeah, I'm just checking out the weapons.
[210:26.86]Because...
[210:29.04]I don't know.
[210:29.38]Sometimes I find different playstyles are more fun to me than the one that's the best.
[210:34.45]Usually.
[210:34.83]Depends.
[210:37.97]But, like, for instance, these... I have not figured out, like, the actual trajectory of how this works.
[210:43.35]They kind of just shoot in a random direction forward.
[210:46.33]Did we miss, like, a million boxes?
[210:49.76]Um... No.
[210:52.12]Yeah.
[210:52.86]Oh, we did.
[210:53.20]We missed one.
[210:54.40]I'll get it.
[210:56.32]I'll get it.
[211:06.21]Yep.
[211:10.17]Yep.
[211:14.39]This game is 50 bucks.
[211:16.35]I believe it is... It was 35 on the Steam sale.
[211:20.12]But I don't think it's on sale anymore.
[211:23.56]But... Isn't the Steam sale still going?
[211:26.02]Actually, it's been a while since I've looked.
[211:27.48]This is not on sale anymore. ...
[211:38.60]Although, I mean, this did just come out, like, this past summer.
[211:43.36]So, this isn't, like, a 10-year-old game.
[211:46.83]Although, EDF 5, isn't that, like, actually coming out at some point here?
[211:51.11]Or does that already exist?
[211:52.39]I thought so.
[211:54.59]They're making EDF 5 now, yeah.
[211:57.01]So, I guess this is, like, the latest version.
[211:58.43]It's on Steam.
[212:02.16]Don't buy this if you have a Phenom CPU.
[212:04.08]You can't run it 50 bucks down the drain.
[212:06.56]Well, you can refund it.
[212:09.30]At least Steam refunds exist.
[212:12.02]So if you actually can't run it, then by all means, you can return it.
[212:19.93]Are you doing an airstrike?
[212:21.33]Yeah.
[212:28.16]How does the Olympic gun work?
[212:31.02]You can detonate it with bright.
[212:33.96]Oh, I haven't been detonating.
[212:35.12]I was trying to figure out what button it was and nothing was doing it.
[212:37.93]If it has more than one, you can shoot them all out and detonate them with right click.
[212:44.19]I'm getting fucking killed here.
[212:45.47]Is this guy behind us?
[212:55.31]I didn't know there was a fucking guy behind us.
[212:57.55]How did I miss that many times in a row?
[212:59.15]I don't know.
[212:59.49]I can't tell you.
[213:03.16]I don't like this weapon.
[213:05.50]It just feels way too random.
[213:09.38]Maybe if you have a situation where there's like a million things in the road or something.
[213:12.24]Oh, come on.
[213:12.84]It's so satisfying.
[213:14.34]It's a re-release from PS3.
[213:16.04]Yeah, that's true.
[213:20.98]Uh, you get them all?
[213:23.76]Make sure you pick up the armor packs.
[213:26.14]I'm too slow.
[213:37.54]Blast Twin Spears, level 20.
[213:39.82]That's what I like to see.
[213:42.06]What does that mean?
[213:45.44]I got the bike.
[213:49.50]Oh, good.
[213:49.72]You got the bike.
[213:50.78]Good luck driving that bike.
[213:52.53]Hope you have fun.
[213:57.37]Jesus Christ.
[214:00.69]Cool.
[214:02.01]Let me look at the other...
[214:04.68]I kind of want to... I want to do a run with the girl.
[214:08.80]Hover girl.
[214:11.12]The who?
[214:11.81]Hover girl.
[214:13.33]Oh, okay.
[214:13.97]I mean, I already have a level 20 weapon on her already.
[214:18.43]Range attacks.
[214:19.39]Plasma launcher three times.
[214:26.26]D2 plasma launcher.
[214:34.19]Yeah, I want to try her.
[214:34.91]Alright, you ready?
[214:39.42]Ready for a mission two?
[214:40.26]Hey, you guys ready to go to mission two again?
[214:42.82]Hope you guys are having a good time in the chat.
[214:44.26]It's fun.
[214:44.56]Dude, when I played Warframe, the amount of times that I did fucking whatever it was called, I can't remember the name anymore.
[214:50.89]It was just fun to shoot things.
[214:54.39]Yeah.
[214:56.73]How does it run for a port?
[214:57.91]It looks surprisingly smooth.
[214:59.13]It's been running pretty flawlessly for me.
[215:05.16]Colors.
[215:06.94]Where's the germa colors?
[215:10.42]Yeah, watch me call on the bike and just fucking murder everyone.
[215:16.04]I would be very surprised.
[215:20.95]Do I get the Super Saiyan?
[215:22.41]That's what the Super Saiyan is, isn't it?
[215:23.75]Yeah, it is.
[215:27.69]Dude, the Super Saiyan is like the coolest move.
[215:31.07]Is that your blast grenade?
[215:32.10]Yeah, I just put it on to try it.
[215:38.16]This character's fucking so cool.
[215:40.30]It's really hard to aim it.
[215:43.52]But holy shit, this character's awesome.
[215:46.54]Yeah.
[215:49.90]I mean, this character that I'm in, really dumb.
[215:55.00]If only they had something cool.
[216:00.85]How do I use the shoulder howitzers?
[216:02.43]Oh, I just got, like, way too overzealous.
[216:04.13]I gotta get out of there.
[216:06.45]Uh, shoulder howitzers?
[216:07.15]What do you mean?
[216:09.56]I figured it out.
[216:13.38]Actually, how do I use the one on the... Okay, so you use this.
[216:18.76]Right?
[216:19.96]Oh, yes, yes, yes.
[216:20.83]That is one of the most awkward things to control.
[216:23.67]How do you shoot the howitzer?
[216:26.29]Shift is one of them, but that's only from one side.
[216:28.65]Maybe, like, right shift?
[216:29.95]I don't know.
[216:37.61]You need like a sensitivity of 4,000.
[216:40.65]Yeah, it's really awkward to drive.
[216:42.57]That's why I didn't want to use it.
[216:46.79]It's cool, but it's hard to control.
[216:48.93]Oh, yeah.
[216:55.06]But that's... Yeah.
[217:00.38]Make sure you're picking up any of the boxes.
[217:02.58]Oh, you kind of can't, so I'll just do it.
[217:04.44]No, I can't.
[217:07.95]Get those buildings out of the way.
[217:12.09]You're kind of the building destroyer right now.
[217:14.39]Yeah, the only thing I don't care about this... I don't like how little ammo it has.
[217:20.72]But I feel like I'm going to get out of this very soon.
[217:30.12]This character is so much fun, just to fly around and zap people.
[217:34.24]Oh yeah, and you're using this for the first time against all those flying things?
[217:38.70]No.
[217:39.56]You can't aim that thing.
[217:45.53]Any boxes that I missed?
[217:46.47]I don't think so.
[217:54.43]And explosion!
[217:56.27]I went overshadowed a little bit.
[217:58.68]It's really annoying.
[217:59.56]I don't get why they made it the way they did.
[218:02.52]Really?
[218:04.61]Like, it has that line coming out of you, right?
[218:07.29]But the line, like, points up.
[218:10.25]Not where you're looking.
[218:13.55]Yeah, and when you move your mouse, it's very sluggish too.
[218:16.17]You kind of have to, like, really drag it over.
[218:29.01]Oh, lots of ants over there.
[218:30.77]There's a weapon.
[218:40.34]How did I land inside of this guy?
[218:43.02]Look out, a bridge.
[218:45.92]Let me get these items.
[218:49.27]I saw a box somewhere, an item box.
[218:51.29]There it is.
[218:52.77]Got it.
[219:02.65]Weapon box near you Like how do you I Guess yeah by the time about a family you can call on the other one
[219:24.16]Honestly, that thing and the level we're going to be doing here is... It gets destroyed instantly.
[219:29.32]There's just too many things going on.
[219:30.28]I know, but I'm just seeing what the classes have.
[219:33.73]It's fun to try the new things out.
[219:35.59]Yeah, see, my problem was I was trying the new thing out in the hardest mission we've seen so far.
[219:41.05]Probably not the greatest fucking idea.
[219:44.51]I mean, I've had some bad ideas in the past.
[219:47.46]Maybe that time I was playing basketball with...
[219:52.94]uh the president and accustomed me like playing basketball the president metal gear I'm not sure he realizes yeah he's muted right now he killed me I don't think he knows metal gear nice job nice work that metal gear
[220:20.45]I got the same weapon twice.
[220:22.81]A level 12 weapon.
[220:24.57]I got the attack wheel.
[220:27.71]I got a blast grenade.
[220:28.93]Have you... On Fly Girl, blast grenade?
[220:31.43]Blast grenade?
[220:33.61]Yeah, that's what the Kamehameha is.
[220:36.03]Is it?
[220:37.21]Yeah, you didn't even use the real one.
[220:40.35]But you don't even know what I'm talking about when I say it's really annoying to aim.
[220:47.50]Really, so blast grenade and D2 plasma launcher are different.
[220:51.79]Yeah, very different.
[220:53.43]Really?
[220:54.49]Okay.
[220:55.52]Well, I like the launcher.
[220:57.80]Geist?
[220:59.26]Look at how fucking huge this thing is.
[221:00.76]Oh no, that's just pointing in the camera.
[221:05.04]Another one?
[221:07.68]You want to do it again?
[221:09.99]What is this rapier thrust?
[221:11.49]I have a level 21.
[221:11.81]Is it any good?
[221:15.14]That's what I use all the time you just fly straight into things and it's kind of like a constant shotgun It barely uses up any energy and only uses energy when you reload and has 600 shots.
[221:24.54]It shreds everything.
[221:25.58]I'm gonna try this Try the sniper in the rapier thrust All right, let me change the color scheme.
[221:31.95]Hold on There we go, that's much better
[221:39.46]Oh god, no, it's too short range.
[221:40.70]No, that thing is awesome.
[221:41.92]Just quiet everyone.
[221:42.78]Here's some variety.
[221:43.54]You guys looking for variety?
[221:44.90]We're gonna go to mission two now instead of mission three.
[221:49.40]That's what I used 90% of every mission we played.
[221:52.96]Really?
[221:54.16]Yep.
[221:57.87]Whose fit points are these?
[222:01.83]Later missions get new drops.
[222:02.87]Well, we're not gonna be able to do the later missions with some of the shit we have now is the problem.
[222:08.28]Now that we have a standard set of gear for everybody.
[222:10.90]Yeah, that was the main thing.
[222:13.36]Get the anti-air weapon.
[222:14.88]Yeah, I'll take a look at it.
[222:18.13]Corporal Small says, Sturred dissed me.
[222:21.49]What did you say?
[222:22.09]What did you do?
[222:24.03]Oh, he was the one that said that the gun you're using sucks.
[222:31.88]Wait, I'm... What the fuck is going on?
[222:36.54]I have never used the attack whale before.
[222:38.62]Oh, so that's what happened.
[222:42.69]No, I'm always curious.
[222:43.43]What is this?
[222:45.03]What is this thing?
[222:47.43]Oh, that's the sniper I was using.
[222:50.47]What the fuck?
[222:51.17]This is the fucking best weapon in the whole game.
[222:55.98]Are you shitting me?
[222:57.74]I like the cannon.
[222:58.70]The whale is awesome.
[223:00.42]Okay.
[223:01.46]Now I know why you were killing everything.
[223:04.66]That thing is fucking nuts.
[223:06.78]You can just stand in one spot and just hold the beam on somebody.
[223:09.34]Instantly kill them.
[223:12.55]That gun you're using right now, it pretty much one-shots these ants.
[223:17.45]And it has the fire rate of forever.
[223:20.41]It's insane.
[223:21.87]We should just both be playing these characters.
[223:26.12]I really like this.
[223:27.32]The attack whale is incredible.
[223:29.64]Yeah, it's cool, but you can only do it once every three minutes.
[223:33.36]I've got two of them.
[223:37.68]Oh, this thing is cool too.
[223:40.20]I'm coming at you with the bug.
[223:41.96]Bug V Bug, it's fair now.
[223:49.70]Staples.
[223:50.66]That one's easy.
[223:52.28]Hey Jerva.
[223:53.20]Yep.
[223:54.14]Bug V Bug.
[223:56.40]Where'd you get that thing?
[223:59.20]How come you got the cool weapons and I got like the shitty mines?
[224:03.30]That has two flamethrowers and a gatling gun?
[224:07.18]You get the bike.
[224:08.60]I got the dumb bike that can't drive.
[224:10.19]This thing turns really fast too.
[224:11.79]This thing's great.
[224:13.77]It's just kind of low level.
[224:18.51]Ooh, and it does have a dash.
[224:19.49]Holy shit.
[224:21.53]It doesn't need that.
[224:24.72]Ghost in the shell.
[224:25.48]That kind of does look like the, uh... What are those enemies and ghosts in the shell?
[224:31.48]Tamagotchis.
[224:33.08]And they go... Oh, yes!
[224:35.42]Oh, boy!
[224:37.10]Right.
[224:38.74]Yeah, Tommy got you.
[224:40.80]No, I ran out of juice there.
[224:42.08]I was expending it too much.
[224:44.04]Holy shit.
[224:53.39]I just had a magnifying glass on that guy's face and it didn't kill him.
[225:06.06]This thing is fucking awesome.
[225:13.30]Come on, dude!
[225:14.38]Stop dropping a fucking whale on me!
[225:16.94]You see?
[225:17.46]You see?
[225:18.26]It's hard not to.
[225:20.27]You were talking all this shit.
[225:21.75]I know.
[225:22.07]You were saying all this fucking shit about me dropping whales.
[225:24.83]And you've killed me with the whale twice.
[225:25.95]That's different because I was standing right next to it.
[225:28.13]Come on.
[225:29.45]Come on.
[225:31.69]You're dropping another one.
[225:34.64]Dropping tons of them.
[225:36.54]I seriously have no idea what you're talking about.
[225:38.58]Apparently you can climb buildings Yeah with the spider.
[225:42.28]Yeah, it goes up slants and everything.
[225:44.36]Yeah, you got the cool fucking weapons for that class The attack wheel is the cool weapon Yeah, the cool weapon that you've killed your only teammate with two times in a row the two times you've used it Oh, no, I've been using it a ton.
[225:56.69]Yep.
[225:57.29]No That was such a lie.
[225:59.85]No
[226:01.48]That was like the... No!
[226:02.36]I'm taking all the health too.
[226:05.92]You just dropped a bomb on me.
[226:07.06]Not there.
[226:12.44]I think that's it for you.
[226:14.51]Does it run out of ammo?
[226:15.43]Because the reloads are like stuck.
[226:17.01]You have all those things?
[226:19.13]I didn't even get like... Okay, he like did the random generation.
[226:22.43]Like what was he going to try?
[226:23.33]The random what was I going to try generator.
[226:26.45]I picked the dumb shitty thing.
[226:31.88]Come on, give me a little break.
[226:37.34]Yeah, nice try.
[226:57.06]You just suck, Jerma, in all caps.
[226:59.72]How dare you.
[227:02.99]I think we're ready to do this.
[227:04.81]I'm going to use this character.
[227:05.91]I like this setup.
[227:10.37]The same problem I ran into, though, was I was sniping everything, but there were so many things I was running out of energy.
[227:15.88]But now that we're both killing things, maybe it won't happen.
[227:18.00]All right, let me see.
[227:19.34]Where's that anti-air?
[227:25.25]I think I have an anti-air cannon.
[227:28.15]An anti-aircraft Pandora model designed to be fired upward, and this especially effective against flying enemies, discharges balls of energy which hang silently in the air and fire off arrows of light.
[227:38.66]Pressing and holding the attack button will determine distance, and releasing the attack button will discharge.
[227:47.15]Okay, I'm gonna have to give this a... Wait, what was that called?
[227:50.47]Pandora Anti-Air Custom.
[227:52.89]Yeah, that's the thing.
[227:53.93]You throw out the bomb and it shoots lasers everywhere.
[227:56.41]But that one only shoots it straight up.
[227:58.52]Okay, well, I mean, should I use it in this air mission?
[228:01.24]Try it, but don't throw it into the ground because it'll go through the ground and not do anything.
[228:05.14]Well, I'm gonna pick a different weapon then because...
[228:08.89]We're doing the level... I'm not going to use this character.
[228:12.37]I just want to see if this is any good.
[228:15.13]It's the... Yeah, it's the thing I don't like, but it might be good here.
[228:21.71]It's level 13, though.
[228:22.78]Is that really worth putting on at this level?
[228:26.36]I don't know.
[228:27.16]You're only going to be using the sniper, really, and throwing that out when it's off cooldown.
[228:30.68]But it's level 13.
[228:31.88]That's what I'm saying.
[228:35.78]The sniper is all you need for this mission.
[228:38.65]you're right let's try to do level 11 and kill like 200 giant floating ships I want to see how this works use the geist it's decent for the flying enemies let's give this a try I don't this might be really good or be really terrible I gotta pee again you know when you gotta pee and it sucks
[229:08.60]I wish I could just piss my pants and not... I know, like, I really just wish, like, we had the technology to solve this.
[229:15.04]Yeah, right?
[229:18.68]Why can't I just be sitting on a toilet?
[229:21.54]Right now, in front of my computer.
[229:28.82]Is it too far away?
[229:34.44]I hope these actually hit them.
[229:38.64]I'm just like the dentist right now.
[229:40.88]This thing is so good.
[229:53.99]Oh, I don't even get a dash.
[230:01.02]I'm gonna throw that up there.
[230:03.46]So is that gonna... I guess it's working, right?
[230:06.74]Somewhat?
[230:08.02]I'm just gonna throw it up in the air.
[230:13.26]You guys see how many cavities I'm taking care of right now?
[230:15.46]No, I can't.
[230:20.78]I gotta hold back on this for a minute.
[230:24.87]When does she do the thing where she explodes?
[230:26.71]You fly fast enough that you'll get out of it and they announce it.
[230:29.75]I'll let you know.
[230:32.61]I need to recharge.
[230:41.43]Help me!
[230:52.27]Almost killed myself.
[230:54.88]Watch out, oh fuck, okay.
[230:56.28]I gotta pay attention to the mini-map.
[231:01.60]Alright, we're kind of, we're doing alright.
[231:05.39]Alright, how far away are we gonna get?
[231:06.63]That's the question.
[231:16.12]I don't know if I'm gonna be able to.
[231:17.80]Actually, no, I have the dash.
[231:28.45]God, there's so many cavities.
[231:37.26]Oh, you have to get away, get away.
[231:38.18]I'm right next to you.
[231:41.05]Not far enough away.
[231:45.81]I'm gonna wait until this charges up.
[231:47.35]I got my thing coming down the alleyway here though.
[231:49.13]Get the guys above us.
[231:54.98]As long as they don't get like surrounded, we'll be fine.
[231:56.82]Alright, here we go.
[232:00.44]Oh, that's a melee weapon.
[232:02.06]Fuck.
[232:03.16]I had no idea.
[232:06.95]Just a little too far away.
[232:12.63]There's so many in the air.
[232:18.25]These fucking TIE Fighters.
[232:20.71]I'm trying- Oh my fucking god, there's so many!
[232:24.54]There's so fucking many of them!
[232:28.12]I have to wait for a recharge.
[232:31.05]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[232:32.01]That's what was happening to me.
[232:33.01]Like, you can kill them, but then out of nowhere... Jesus!
[232:35.83]Why are there so many of them?
[232:37.53]We can't even go... We gotta, like, get away.
[232:39.51]I'm dead.
[232:41.17]Are you?
[232:41.99]Holy shit!
[232:46.49]Um... So, do you need four people?
[232:48.91]This is... Okay, um... Well...
[233:02.02]That was, uh... That was like we died within 10 seconds of phase 2.
[233:10.74]I think I should play something else.
[233:14.42]I felt like I was killing a lot of fucking things there too.
[233:17.39]It's hard for me to tell if I was killing things.
[233:19.51]Because the way this weapon works... It's probably not the best against air.
[233:23.83]Was that anti-air thing doing enough?
[233:30.15]The problem this thing definitely might see now is you're using the sniper rifle and you're running out of energy and all of your weapons Take energy.
[233:36.41]I know what about this guy?
[233:40.38]Maybe if we both like our dentists, what if we just have double dentist?
[233:44.66]No, you can't do that Yeah, I think I'm honestly dude with if we do double dentist we might be able to do it Did you ever try the g3 shotgun
[233:58.08]Yeah.
[233:59.28]It's only eight shots, though.
[234:02.26]So, when you shoot that thing eight times, and if you kill eight things, or four things, that laser rifle that we have is the wing lady.
[234:11.90]Okay, let's try double dentist.
[234:13.36]Let's do double dentist, and I'm going to try this geist.
[234:16.88]Even though it's only level 13.
[234:21.14]Alright, double dentist.
[234:22.64]Let's try it.
[234:29.10]Oh, I have an 18 level Geist.
[234:31.12]It wasn't that good.
[234:32.72]No.
[234:35.18]I'll change it then.
[234:37.30]I would say just get stuff that's at least level 16 or 17 or something.
[234:42.85]This thing's 18.
[234:45.93]Was your anti-air thing hitting anything?
[234:49.09]I mean, it might have been, but at level 13, I feel like it's not really doing that much.
[234:52.92]What is the Thunder Bow?
[234:54.66]This is 18.
[234:58.05]This looks like 275 meter range.
[235:00.21]It's just kind of like a... It might be good.
[235:03.00]I think it was like an AOE kind of close range, just super lightning blast.
[235:07.80]Whatever.
[235:08.08]A double dentist is going to be the winner here, I believe.
[235:11.96]Cavities beware.
[235:13.00]All right, let's do it.
[235:17.02]Double dentist.
[235:20.85]Especially because you can start killing them way before they actually land.
[235:25.83]Yeah.
[235:28.47]thunder bow oh I forgot to pee zappo is actually really good yeah we'll try it see how good it is I love how the graphics haven't changed since the first game they really haven't they're a little bit better but no I mean I feel like the one we played like last year was really ugly looking it was
[235:58.31]It was.
[236:00.20]Oh, double dentist.
[236:01.74]Nice germicolor.
[236:03.36]Thanks.
[236:04.12]They're not in range yet.
[236:05.96]Dentalist?
[236:15.99]Holy shit, double dentist seems like it's gonna be good.
[236:30.78]We get like tunnel vision and they give up a couple of minute of getting in I Still feel like second phase we might just get totally overwhelmed maybe because we get into these situations where you can only like okay after shoot for like a second then stop and
[237:01.73]How far does the lightning bolt gun go not that far Think of it as like a shotgun
[237:29.10]Can this guy shut up and help?
[237:32.13]Yeah, all I hear are those people screaming in my ears.
[237:34.55]Alright, here we go.
[237:41.63]Back it up!
[237:43.79]Use this time to let your fucking thing go up cooldown.
[237:50.07]You're in there kind of deep.
[237:56.55]Wait, does he want to buff me?
[237:59.71]This is the part where there's a lot in the air and they haven't quite come down yet.
[238:10.09]I ran out.
[238:11.67]There's one above us that's kind of being annoying.
[238:13.49]Alright, I got full charge.
[238:18.94]There's one behind us.
[238:28.67]Might even be good to just completely split up.
[238:31.01]Like, you go left, I go right.
[238:32.53]So we don't have a giant horde on us.
[238:36.65]They're struggling to come down the street right now.
[238:39.26]I'm all the way, pretty much going down the left alleyway here.
[238:47.92]Look at this guy.
[238:54.17]Jesus.
[239:03.91]See, now you have to run, and in order to run, you can't shoot them.
[239:08.65]My god!
[239:09.51]You remember the Petri dish?
[239:24.75]This is G2A Petri dish.
[239:28.09]This is the G2A Petri dish.
[239:33.09]Use code petri dish.
[239:35.21]I feel like we need to like activate something You know what man okay, he yells something at us.
[239:44.69]I'm dead Doesn't he go like activate the fucking detonator didn't he say something like that alright?
[239:50.34]They're all coming to you.
[239:51.22]There's like a dozen there like two dozen that are on the way to you right now Yeah, this is impossible.
[239:57.82]There's too many.
[239:58.60]Look at the mini map
[240:02.28]Wait, hold on a minute.
[240:04.98]Are you still alive?
[240:08.99]No, I'm dead.
[240:10.19]Activate artillery, is what it says.
[240:12.09]Is there something on the map we can go to?
[240:16.12]I think on the other side from where we started, there actually is something that they're fighting right now.
[240:19.74]Yeah, there's... Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[240:22.38]Do it again.
[240:22.90]Just go again.
[240:23.96]Okay.
[240:25.66]As soon as we get to that second phase, we have to go across this field, and there was, like, missiles all shooting them out of the air.
[240:30.51]I got the guys on the left.
[240:32.39]Let's make this, like, democratic, you know what I mean?
[240:35.01]I think we won't have a problem as long as we do that.
[240:53.71]I'd listen to him more.
[240:54.65]He'd fucking speak up.
[241:08.35]If they get in too close, it's like one or two shots from that and they're dead.
[241:14.15]Shit, I ran out of fucking boost on the video.
[241:18.63]Gonna let it charge all the way.
[241:24.11]EDF!
[241:26.17]EDF!
[241:27.27]EDF!
[241:36.04]Behind you there's a guy.
[241:43.34]Oh, I'm very low on health.
[241:45.00]I don't want that to happen.
[241:46.78]Alright, back it up.
[241:51.13]No, actually, let's start out, make our way over there, because she's going to do the detonation thing, right?
[241:55.13]In like a second.
[241:55.59]No.
[241:57.27]Well, we have to go back, because their mothership shoots.
[242:00.35]Yeah, but I mean, can we avoid it from... No.
[242:03.04]No, we can't?
[242:04.32]Nope.
[242:06.84]Are you sure?
[242:08.07]Wouldn't want to risk it just come back.
[242:10.21]Oh boy.
[242:11.07]I'm like as soon as soon as it's the motherships done shooting We're gonna go to the other side Okey-dokey Oh
[242:37.18]Here comes the shot.
[242:40.46]Yikes.
[242:41.36]All right.
[242:42.94]You ready?
[242:43.38]Let's start going.
[242:44.12]Yep.
[242:44.50]Okay.
[242:50.42]Oh, I'm out of fuel with 20 health.
[242:53.10]That's not good.
[242:56.74]I got it.
[242:58.04]I'm right behind you.
[243:02.30]Duh!
[243:03.12]There's health right there, but don't even stop.
[243:10.40]Ahhh, this round it goes?
[243:16.12]That guy's got a Nagel Ring?
[243:19.71]Ah, shit.
[243:20.61]I'm in trouble.
[243:22.31]I fucking accidentally hit R. I think I'm gonna be fine though.
[243:27.23]Are you sure?
[243:27.61]Like, what the fuck are we going?
[243:29.43]Why are we going over here?
[243:31.39]I swear I saw missiles shooting at him.
[243:33.23]Missiles shooting at him?
[243:35.09]You sure about that?
[243:36.93]I am positive I saw it.
[243:39.61]There's so many people looking at me.
[243:42.27]Please find those missiles.
[243:43.25]Are you sure it's not the green blips?
[243:49.13]Oh, I'm dead here, dude.
[243:51.15]I have all of Independence Day fighting me.
[243:56.28]I'm dead.
[244:06.82]What did I see then?
[244:08.68]What did you see that was over here?
[244:11.57]Last time when we died, a whole bunch of homing rockets in the distance from over here shot up and killed a whole bunch of them.
[244:18.87]They don't appear until the guy on the radio says that they're in position.
[244:22.76]Apparently.
[244:23.50]Oh, so game sucks.
[244:26.04]so I think we just need to stand back and wait we should we shouldn't have been flying there may be a certain amount we have to kill before he activates it well okie dokie because we were running for a long time and I feel like they should have shown up
[244:58.63]Alright.
[245:00.63]Is the green blips?
[245:02.49]No, the green blips are fucking medkits.
[245:04.57]Like they've always been.
[245:06.35]Somebody's really mad at you for saying that.
[245:23.46]Come on, get in range.
[245:24.74]Come on.
[245:26.16]Come on.
[245:37.66]I need to recharge.
[245:47.53]I got a charge up here.
[246:06.87]So I just can't do what we were doing before Yeah Just try and hold them off kill as many as we can up until we hear them talk and let's listen and hear what they say Wait, what?
[246:35.62]One asshole behind us.
[246:36.62]Okay.
[246:47.94]Such focus.
[246:49.28]Alright.
[246:51.18]I don't want to use a bunch of my rifle if we have to fly somewhere.
[246:55.40]No, we're not flying.
[246:56.06]We're just gonna stay here and kill them when they come down this alley.
[247:07.09]I feel like I've made that noise like five times.
[247:14.29]Okay, you hear what he said?
[247:18.01]Yeah.
[247:18.70]Where is it?
[247:18.96]Deploy the Nagel Ring.
[247:20.02]Deploy the Nagel Ring.
[247:21.78]I think it isn't deployed yet, though, because he said that last time, because I made the Nagel Ring joke.
[247:26.58]Okay, so what do we do?
[247:27.20]Just keep fighting?
[247:30.10]There's a lot of, like, green blips across the map, dude.
[247:33.08]Cause that's because we've been killing things that have all been dropping armor and shit.
[247:36.90]I'm, like, we're, like, instantly dead here.
[247:38.70]Yeah, I'm dead.
[247:45.85]Oh, I ran out of fucking energy.
[247:50.33]That was the order to deploy it.
[247:56.47]Deploy the bagel ring.
[248:00.46]Kill more dudes to the NPCs.
[248:01.82]I mean, but... Almost a hundred enemies come over here.
[248:07.74]I think one of us could play Fencer and just distract everything with the infinite dash at this point.
[248:17.67]Get an airstrike?
[248:18.33]Will an airstrike actually hit them?
[248:20.99]Yeah.
[248:23.91]Like the, um... Whatchamacallit?
[248:30.89]Apparently it's in position.
[248:31.91]How are you still alive?
[248:37.45]There's a lot of health kits here.
[248:40.37]I'm just flying from health kit to health kit in the middle.
[248:43.03]Okay, now, yeah, they're all getting annihilated.
[248:45.88]So we just have to, like, just fly around, stay alive?
[248:47.64]I'm for health.
[248:49.06]Oh, got it.
[248:50.32]Yeah, I think if we had a fencer at that point, because you wouldn't die if you just dashed circles around.
[248:54.82]It's just that I'm running out of energy and I can't do it, so let me play fencer and you just do what you're doing.
[249:00.60]I want to change a weapon.
[249:05.76]But yeah, it killed probably half of them.
[249:08.14]In the, like, couple seconds it was active.
[249:09.74]Maybe we should just both be fencer.
[249:14.98]I feel like that might be a good idea.
[249:16.16]Just use, like, the machine guns and just annihilate everything.
[249:23.41]Lightweight cannon.
[249:24.75]Just do two lightweight cannons.
[249:26.03]What do you think?
[249:26.81]I think you're really better off just being a dentist.
[249:32.71]Just stay on her.
[249:40.12]Stay with the dentist?
[249:41.65]Yeah.
[249:45.35]I almost feel like I was, uh... I'll stay with this, just because I feel like it's better for me.
[249:52.07]When that time comes... Just go between buildings and... I'm just gonna fly around, yeah.
[249:59.20]Try and get in the middle if they push you out that way and get the health bits and blah blah blah blah.
[250:02.24]Alright, let's do it!
[250:03.99]This is it.
[250:05.91]If we beat this, then I have to fucking pee, dude.
[250:08.57]It's not good.
[250:09.87]No.
[250:12.78]You're only allowed to pee when we beat it.
[250:14.40]That's what I'm saying.
[250:15.62]We have to win now.
[250:21.34]Dude, take a tea break.
[250:22.24]You gotta go.
[250:23.12]Go, go, go.
[250:30.45]Put the rapier on.
[250:32.98]It's you're spending all your energy flying at them then Well, if they when they get in because I mean someone was saying they hovered just out of range.
[250:40.09]I was trying it before I killed a couple but it wasn't very consistent Oh, that's what this gun is
[251:00.96]PDF Die
[251:31.15]On second thought, this gun actually does seem to work very well.
[251:34.23]What is it?
[251:36.17]High altitude impact launcher.
[251:37.51]Shoots a whole bunch of missiles up and they all come down.
[251:40.25]So I'm shooting 12 missiles.
[251:41.49]It's just if they hit them or not, but they're doing a lot of damage if they actually do.
[251:47.27]Cool.
[251:52.36]So you're saying I should just not even attack, just fly the fuck around, just get away?
[251:57.60]When the giant wave of everything comes, yeah.
[252:13.20]Get a rifle!
[252:14.10]Is grenade on the switch?
[252:19.26]Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
[252:19.94]I'm gonna put the grenade on and run.
[252:31.19]Get away!
[252:34.61]Oh god, I don't have the dash.
[252:37.37]We don't dash with this gun?
[252:38.51]We're far enough away.
[252:40.57]I know, but I'm not gonna be able to stay alive if I don't have the fucking dash.
[252:45.73]Uh oh.
[252:50.60]Alright, here we go.
[252:52.30]I'm gonna throw out the grenade in one second.
[252:59.63]And right about... No.
[253:06.99]Oh, well, during this, before they actually start deploying it, we're going to have to kill a couple.
[253:13.41]I fucked that up.
[253:15.51]I thought they were coming immediately after that shit.
[253:20.71]God, I'm going to piss my fucking pants.
[253:23.16]Fuck.
[253:27.06]That guy came all the way fucking around.
[253:30.66]I'm just going to the building.
[253:33.09]I'm dead.
[253:33.59]I don't have the dash with this weapon.
[253:36.21]I could not have known.
[253:37.11]Because I have the shield.
[253:39.81]This weapon is awful.
[253:42.47]It's not what I thought it was.
[253:51.40]I gotta pee.
[253:52.06]I gotta pee right now.
[253:54.22]Just lose.
[253:55.88]I did.
[253:57.60]Before I seriously shit my pants.
[253:59.04]Go!
[253:59.24]Go!
[256:00.82]All right.
[256:01.72]Yep.
[256:01.82]So what's the deal here?
[256:04.32]Um, you died.
[256:05.54]I don't know why you died.
[256:06.98]And I didn't have the dash.
[256:09.75]Let's just do the same thing, but don't die.
[256:15.85]So what's the end goal here?
[256:17.55]Like, are we trying to go to like the middle?
[256:21.16]Just avoid them for as long as you can.
[256:22.82]Kill a couple so that they deploy the rockets, and once the rockets are deployed, we'll be fine.
[256:27.04]And I'm playing Fencer with the shield dashed because they can't catch you ever and you don't run out of energy with it.
[256:39.54]I should even equip just like double shields.
[256:47.41]Thank you to drones.exe.
[256:50.62]That's a very fitting name.
[256:53.62]To Quickie Surzik.
[256:55.80]Left side of town for 10 months.
[256:56.86]Thanks, left side of town.
[256:59.20]Captain Block Flex Retro for nine months.
[257:03.10]Lunar Days.
[257:04.14]Thanks, you guys, for the subs.
[257:08.24]I'm in love with you.
[257:13.65]The armor limit for the mission is like 900 and you have less than 200 health is what somebody just said.
[257:21.86]We might be like underleveled for this, I guess, maybe.
[257:35.69]Oh my god, it doesn't work with this.
[257:37.13]I don't dash with this either.
[257:41.07]Quit.
[257:42.27]What?
[257:43.09]I'm sorry.
[257:45.01]I thought I had dashed with this item before.
[257:46.72]I mean, are we like just severely underleveled?
[257:54.96]Is that like what the problem is?
[257:58.49]No, I think we can do this.
[258:00.31]I'm just curious here, hold on.
[258:02.79]Armor limit 893 or less.
[258:05.95]For, like, level 10.
[258:10.52]We actually might just be really fucking underleveled.
[258:15.04]And by underleveled, like, we need more ammo packs.
[258:19.42]One more try.
[258:19.94]Alright, you ready?
[258:20.96]One more try.
[258:23.41]I have faith in the strategy.
[258:25.13]Okay.
[258:25.27]Okay.
[258:38.27]I don't know why, but the font of this game bothers me.
[258:42.20]It is sort of weird looking, isn't it?
[258:51.50]It's too... It's too regular looking, isn't it?
[259:00.60]It's doable.
[259:01.26]It's definitely doable, but... I mean, it might not be terrible if we were to get another 20 or 30 armor points or something.
[259:09.37]What?
[259:09.65]Alright, you got the right shit on?
[259:11.55]Yep.
[259:17.22]Yeah.
[259:40.25]The ones that, like, get behind us are the ones that, like, this guy, somehow, flying all the way around us.
[259:54.80]Get caught in my Ghostbusters goat-catching ray.
[259:58.93]Goat-catching ray.
[259:59.73]I can't even talk tonight for some reason.
[260:05.57]Help me!
[260:14.57]There goes the artillery.
[260:21.00]I need to recharge.
[260:37.97]Not yet.
[260:43.36]no way okay here we go here comes the genocide gun all right so now just kill shit and run away
[261:18.14]I'm sure I have enough jetpack to get out of here if I need to.
[261:36.89]Now should we stick together?
[261:37.59]A little bit.
[261:39.51]Make sure you're full.
[261:40.35]There are too many!
[261:53.33]Okay, okay, I'm fucking gonna die.
[262:00.88]Just kill a couple and up until they say that it's been deployed.
[262:04.96]I mean, I'm just trying to get the fuck away.
[262:10.26]I'm dead.
[262:14.33]For as fast as they get over here, I feel like we're doing something extremely wrong.
[262:20.38]Because it's like, oh, here they come.
[262:23.15]Like, there's a hundred people here.
[262:27.47]I almost had it on as a sky person.
[262:36.01]One more try is me flying around.
[262:37.97]I don't think we need to back up that far to avoid the blast.
[262:44.60]because it doesn't matter aren't the things that we need to do like in the middle no no you have to kill a couple when there's a million of them you have to kill like five to ten of them and then the things actually spawn and then you go to the middle I want to go back on and do something uh I want to get rid of the laser rifle because it's kind of just fucking me up I want to use this thing I feel like this is there's so many people that I could just launch it
[263:14.47]And I'll do, like, this right here.
[263:21.42]Plasma ram?
[263:32.80]Turn right.
[263:33.22]Hide between the buildings.
[263:34.26]Nothing can hit you so long as you don't blow up the buildings.
[263:38.42]That's not true.
[263:40.16]It helps, but yeah.
[263:46.30]I'm gonna try this, because this huge explosion I feel like could do a lot of good.
[263:51.30]Especially when it gets to that point where it's just insane.
[263:53.76]Alright, you ready?
[264:03.05]Yep.
[264:03.65]Plasma 8 gigabytes of RAM.
[264:15.08]short range.
[264:17.12]I mean, they're like right in your face, they come up like this is on hard.
[264:23.83]Because even the explosion radius of this thing could hit like 10 of them in one blast, right?
[264:42.57]Potentially.
[264:44.65]That's what I'm assuming.
[264:45.67]I mean, at this stage I'm not going to be very good.
[264:52.66]Because obviously it's like, these things are so slow and I... I'll just fly into them at this point.
[265:00.98]Get some air shots.
[265:02.66]Air shots.
[265:08.80]And this doesn't take a whole lot of that stuff.
[265:12.52]That's a little too short though Can't really tell how much the foot break the spread is when they hit somebody Yeah, it's a little hard to hit anybody with this thing in the air
[265:42.18]God, God fucking damn it.
[265:44.50]Like this guy just like crept up on top of us and I shot myself in the fucking face because he like- I was thinking of myself the whole time.
[265:50.71]He's gonna shoot it.
[265:52.21]God damn it.
[265:52.77]Don't shoot it.
[265:54.63]Restart.
[265:55.37]Cause like, not gonna be able to do this with fucking 55 health.
[265:57.79]No, no, no, no.
[265:58.65]Get me out of here.
[265:59.33]I wanna do this too.
[266:00.97]That guy- Why did that guy- How did that guy even get fucking behind us?
[266:04.80]I'm just behind you.
[266:05.42]I'm gonna creep up right in your field of view and then you just killed yourself.
[266:11.01]It's his fault.
[266:12.25]It is his fault.
[266:13.67]Get the dice on, be quiet.
[266:31.70]Air Raider healing and shield machine.
[266:36.90]Somebody said.
[266:39.85]I'm gonna use the Ranger.
[266:41.25]You can't really move.
[266:45.07]This mission, it's like... If you stand still for more than three seconds at that phase two, you're just guaranteed to die.
[266:57.91]Unless we're missing something really, really huge, which we might be.
[267:03.14]He's going hollow.
[267:11.26]That tactical nuke?
[267:12.18]Yeah, that's another thing.
[267:22.62]What does this thing even do?
[267:28.28]I've never even used this item.
[267:29.34]I'm not sure what the hell I'm thinking trying to use it.
[267:33.10]What is it?
[267:33.88]I guess it is just like a
[267:36.68]homing I might just be able to this thing's actually pretty great that's a spinner the geist guys too
[268:06.12]He's kinda slow though.
[268:15.11]Watch out for the guy that fucking comes right up your ass.
[268:20.81]That one sneaky asshole.
[268:41.61]No need to aim, but yeah, but look how slow this is and that barely will hit them Yeah, I don't like this it's it's kind of good now because I don't really have to worry about it But once they group up at the end, yeah, that's the most important part All right, the genocide guys work we're taking care of this bond I Really don't you have to be this far away for this.
[269:09.57]I
[269:13.16]Let me regen a bit.
[269:27.07]I'm going between the building.
[269:38.55]Look at those little alleyways.
[270:04.40]Now I'm running.
[270:24.92]I'm just kiting so many of them over here.
[270:26.98]Hopefully you can do things.
[270:31.78]How you doing over there?
[270:34.16]Decently.
[270:34.70]I'm almost out of juice.
[270:41.96]They haven't even said the dialogue line about the things being placed out.
[270:47.15]There was never the duh.
[270:48.61]Oh, fuck.
[270:49.35]I'm in trouble.
[270:49.77]I don't know what's happening.
[270:51.69]I'm in trouble.
[270:52.15]I'm in trouble.
[270:52.55]I'm in trouble.
[270:52.93]I'm in trouble.
[270:54.07]Where are those health packs?
[271:02.05]Keep doing what you're doing, though.
[271:02.87]I'm killing a lot of them.
[271:05.67]I'm just, like, skimming along the edge.
[271:18.65]Oh, health pack, health pack, health pack.
[271:20.51]Lots of health packs.
[271:30.62]That took a while.
[271:31.04]Why did that take so long?
[271:31.80]Wow, look at how many there are.
[271:33.32]Ugh!
[271:37.12]I can only do what I'm doing for so long.
[271:44.88]Why did it take that long?
[271:46.18]I don't know.
[271:54.47]I'm still just flying around.
[271:55.57]I'm just saving all my energy just to skim around.
[271:59.29]There's no more health packs though and I'm running out of juice.
[272:05.59]Me too.
[272:09.37]I'm dead.
[272:09.69]Oh, God.
[272:12.03]Like this, we fucking had it.
[272:15.25]Except for the fact that it took a year.
[272:17.48]I guess we just didn't kill enough, I guess.
[272:19.70]Okay, so maybe if we didn't kill enough because you didn't have a fucking doctor-dentist.
[272:31.45]I feel like this shouldn't be this difficult.
[272:36.60]Why should I have to ski around to avoid the 200 enemies?
[272:51.13]You know what I mean?
[272:52.09]Why do I have to fucking do that?
[272:54.49]If I stand still and attack, I'm dead.
[272:57.57]Low the difficulty.
[273:00.60]Well, okay, mission 10 to mission 11 is like, for some reason, 10,000 times more difficult.
[273:07.38]Yeah, the other missions were quite baby.
[273:09.50]Every single other mission up until 11 has been like, this is not a problem at all.
[273:20.11]I honestly think we would have done it that time if he actually deployed the rockets first.
[273:28.82]It didn't take a year.
[273:29.71]And the only reason it might have taken as long as it did was because you didn't kill anything in the beginning.
[273:35.65]Lower the difficulty for this one mission.
[273:42.71]In higher difficulty, you have to act as a tank and decoy and 1B the damage.
[273:45.87]Well, that's kind of what we were just doing right there.
[273:47.93]And we kind of still lost.
[273:54.74]Let's go back for a second.
[273:58.38]Changed it to Inferno?
[273:59.30]Holy shit, no way.
[274:00.24]Let me... Hold on a second.
[274:08.73]Laser guide kit.
[274:09.93]Sprite fall.
[274:14.39]I don't think I have anything interesting.
[274:25.89]Stream's gonna end with a gorilla reading a book.
[274:27.94]He is.
[274:28.30]Do you want to just be a coward and put this on normal?
[274:32.90]Whatever.
[274:34.12]I don't care.
[274:34.50]Call us cowards.
[274:38.02]Call us fucking piece of shit cowards.
[274:42.04]Normal.
[274:45.60]Let's beat this.
[274:46.15]Oh god.
[274:47.13]We can't even use our weapons.
[274:51.37]We can't use the weapons.
[274:54.05]Well, that's because it's way easier.
[274:55.23]Yeah, but we can't use it.
[274:56.49]So it makes you use, like, shittier weapons.
[274:58.17]Change it?
[274:58.53]Are you sure?
[275:00.10]Yeah, change it.
[275:05.08]We can say up to level 4 weapons.
[275:09.06]Uh, I don't know.
[275:16.62]Uh, up to... 1700 or less?
[275:18.60]I'm very confused here.
[275:20.52]Edit the save file.
[275:25.99]I kind of just want to get past this mission.
[275:27.57]This mission is like real fucking annoying.
[275:29.35]Change it to normal real quick.
[275:30.55]It is all normal.
[275:31.99]No, it's not.
[275:32.59]Because it's hard for me.
[275:39.80]Yeah, your weapon level limit is up to level four.
[275:44.02]I don't think I even have any of those.
[275:46.14]No.
[275:46.92]I have like level zeros.
[275:49.37]Can we do one more where you just use double dentist and then we run the way we were?
[275:55.55]Alright.
[275:55.93]Alright, this is it.
[276:00.90]This is the one.
[276:03.36]I'm doing dentist.
[276:07.08]But then I can't like... Having dentist means I can't really fly around that much.
[276:11.20]Having dentist means we'll kill enough that it happens way sooner.
[276:14.49]Alright.
[276:16.49]Because you weren't killing anything.
[276:18.50]Oh, I was up until that.
[276:20.50]I want to be... Alright.
[276:25.82]Dentist.
[276:26.30]Now, what about... I feel like this can buy some time, potentially.
[276:29.04]Double down on the double dentist.
[276:48.98]This might be enough of a distraction, even though it's not that great.
[276:55.26]You gotta kill phase one, and then skater boy phase two.
[276:58.14]Alright, so here's what's gonna happen.
[277:00.14]The second I hear the, Oh, here it comes, deploy them!
[277:03.69]I'm just gonna ski, and that's all I'm gonna do.
[277:06.47]Yeah, that's a duh!
[277:07.83]Yeah, when he goes, duh!
[277:10.33]Alright, so, duh!
[277:11.67]I'm not fighting any more enemies, I'm just gonna ski around.
[277:17.02]Let's go.
[277:25.84]Bet double dentist on double zero.
[277:28.72]All right, put it on.
[277:30.26]Get yourself ready.
[277:31.22]We're like going to beat it this time.
[277:34.34]And I'm going to bed.
[277:35.22]I thought having a dentist meant something else, but I guess dentists have many different roles.
[277:43.95]That's true.
[277:46.27]The dentist.
[277:57.02]Alright.
[277:59.01]I'll get the left side.
[278:10.17]F. E. D. F. E. D. F. What the fuck?
[278:17.50]Why did that just... Okay, that was weird.
[278:20.58]Apparently, I hit the mouse button?
[278:24.31]Tell me how that happened.
[278:30.19]Glad I did that right there rather than later.
[278:33.45]How did I hit my middle mouse button?
[278:35.55]What does middle mouse button even do for you?
[278:41.40]I, like, scrolled somehow.
[278:43.48]Oh.
[278:50.04]And here comes next phase.
[278:54.63]Not yet.
[278:55.03]Keep killing them.
[279:02.71]I need to recharge.
[279:07.58]Time to fumigate.
[279:08.66]Understood.
[279:09.22]I need... Watch out, this guy.
[279:13.91]There you go.
[279:21.57]Does it feel like you're killing twice as many?
[279:25.86]Yeah.
[279:31.73]I need to recharge.
[279:33.87]Like, we've killed pretty much all of them.
[279:35.17]I feel like there was a lot of leftovers last time in this phase, because we were getting pushed back and they were all... Alright, so after the explosion, wait, and then I'm just going to start fucking sprinting around the map.
[279:47.66]You don't have to start sprinting immediately after the explosion.
[279:50.20]I don't mind.
[279:52.55]But watch the right here.
[279:53.71]We're going to get at least a couple here coming in.
[280:06.31]Meet dumb aliens.
[280:08.25]What?
[280:08.41]Who just make lots of things.
[280:09.99]They're too dumb on their own.
[280:11.79]Alright, this is where it gets a little weird.
[280:19.71]Just making sure I have, like, enough to ski.
[280:30.09]Comes a fucking shitload more.
[280:33.60]Alright, bye-bye.
[280:37.06]Yeah, you see this time we got the duh like way early because we actually killed some.
[280:41.10]Alright, have fun killing things.
[280:45.57]He deploys the Naglering.
[280:54.23]There's a lot of them.
[281:02.29]I'm just trying to use like, ayayay, go the other way.
[281:15.09]Oh, fuck.
[281:18.43]There's so many on me.
[281:20.73]More than the last time.
[281:21.89]There's a health pack right here.
[281:23.15]Fuck, I'm gonna die.
[281:23.96]I'm dead.
[281:31.28]They're all coming to you.
[281:34.30]I know.
[281:37.24]My grenade was not on cooldown.
[281:39.16]Oh, my God.
[281:40.70]Well, I had to fight for one second because they were just in front of me.
[281:45.45]There's not a... Is there a manageable amount there?
[281:48.31]No.
[281:49.33]I can't believe I was able to even do that one time now.
[281:52.54]Because we did that so much better.
[281:55.30]You want to try it again?
[281:57.26]Nah.
[281:58.56]We can lower the difficulty or just play some more missions.
[282:03.59]Nah.
[282:05.33]I just... It's just too many of them and we just die too quickly.
[282:17.46]Yeah, let's play level 10.
[282:19.38]Level 10?
[282:19.62]Yeah.
[282:22.84]It's just... It ramped up to a point where it's almost physically impossible for us to beat this from level 10 to 11.
[282:31.35]So, alright.
[282:33.69]Select a mission.
[282:48.75]Somebody said that the ramp up is kind of crazy.
[282:52.28]I'm seeing you need way more armor.
[282:59.36]Look, it's one thing to have it to be difficult, but we die in one fucking second.
[283:09.56]When they all come over there, even if you ski around, there's only so many times you can do that.
[283:13.94]You get by like three bullets, bing, bing, bing, you die.
[283:31.47]But I think I'm going to take a break and head to bed here after we do this.
[283:40.99]Yeah, I bet.
[283:45.37]Play with four players.
[283:54.38]use the lock on rocket launcher I mean that that's fine but we still die in one second like it's one thing to kill like a couple more than we would but even if running away is more important than the rock but even running away it's you die so quickly that it doesn't even matter like eventually I will run out of boost and instantly die this is gonna happen
[284:36.27]Does it actually show how many credits you have as the engineer man guy?
[284:40.55]I don't think it does.
[284:42.69]I'm not seeing it anywhere.
[284:44.93]People tell me it'll cost this many credits to blah blah blah.
[284:47.67]Credits what?
[284:50.64]Woo!
[284:53.28]Pick up those armor crates.
[285:01.89]This used to be a DBC stream.
[285:04.27]Noooo!
[285:27.07]I'm just gonna throw that out there I'll back up Don't kill us Come here you little shit This is this isn't funny games anymore
[285:57.51]Serious business.
[286:02.01]Red crates are the most important crates.
[286:04.69]This is so much easier compared to the last time we did this, though.
[286:07.97]I feel like I'm getting help.
[286:10.98]Proud of you.
[286:14.98]They really just turn it up on you, huh?
[286:17.42]This is like mission 10.
[286:18.36]Mission 10 to 11, it's like, oh yeah, by the way, you're gonna fucking lose a hundred times.
[286:27.33]Now I'm starting off got to try hard.
[286:29.73]Yeah, we really did get to try hard here in the last like hour or so I Was having fun mission doing I was having fun.
[286:37.97]I'm still am having fun You know fucking super buyout
[287:02.90]Hello!
[287:05.10]It's the dentist!
[287:10.10]Where's this last little ant?
[287:26.02]Behind?
[287:26.70]Yeah, there's like two behind.
[287:35.92]Die, you ant.
[287:37.84]There's one left.
[287:38.96]Wait, wait, wait.
[287:39.34]Before I kill this guy.
[287:40.18]Do we need any more red packs?
[287:46.60]Oh, fuck it.
[287:47.04]Who cares?
[287:50.71]Okay, did I floss today?
[287:51.75]No.
[287:54.21]I didn't even brush my teeth today.
[287:57.01]I ate four Snickers bars.
[288:00.29]Did you really?
[288:01.79]No, of course I didn't.
[288:03.92]No, of course I did.
[288:04.74]Of course I brushed and flossed.
[288:05.98]Come on.
[288:11.66]Miss any?
[288:12.04]I'm just looking around to see if we... I'm stuck inside of my tank.
[288:16.93]Okay.
[288:17.99]I have a super tank.
[288:19.75]Super tank?
[288:20.85]It can't drive.
[288:21.45]It's stuck.
[288:22.17]Didn't we win?
[288:26.95]No.
[288:31.01]There's a weapon right here.
[288:34.66]This new weapon I like this new weapon It's completely fucking stuck.
[288:43.63]Oh, well, that's not good I think it's huge though It does have 6,000 armor well Those stinking aliens come over here.
[288:57.19]Maybe you'll take them out.
[288:58.51]I can get into what can I even do in here?
[289:01.67]Oh Shit, I can shoot
[289:04.80]Maybe this is the strat.
[289:06.58]Is this the strat?
[289:09.06]I mean, I can shoot like once every... No, this is not the strat.
[289:11.54]I can shoot like once every fucking five seconds.
[289:13.16]Well, if I could drive, we could actually kite them.
[289:19.61]But for some reason, I can't drive.
[289:21.23]Also, I have no idea what this howitzer's doing.
[289:37.70]Ahhhh!
[289:39.02]Bugs!
[289:39.88]Bugs!
[289:41.34]Bugs!
[289:42.99]I shouldn't have had this thing on my loadout, it was stupid to put it on.
[289:51.81]It was dumb to put this shit on.
[290:00.40]You're dumb.
[290:01.02]Don't call me fucking dumb.
[290:13.39]Boop.
[290:18.11]I keep having trouble using the dentist rifle because it takes a lot of boost.
[290:21.60]Oh, whoops.
[290:22.96]Don't do, do, don't do.
[290:26.32]It was an accident.
[290:27.40]Oh, you scare me.
[290:28.76]Well, don't you get hit by it.
[290:34.91]Get this ship before we get overwhelmed here.
[290:55.54]Have a lot of experience killing these now I know honestly as long as they don't come in waves of 10 million When they come in manageable waves, they're not insane I
[291:08.32]Manageable?
[291:09.32]Manageable ways.
[291:13.14]Oh, there was a dove.
[291:14.10]I can fly away.
[291:15.12]That's what I do, right?
[291:16.82]Yep.
[291:24.14]Now we start running.
[291:37.08]Somebody said I could really go for some acid soda?
[291:41.96]What?
[291:42.66]I'm just gonna throw this out there, Kira's.
[291:48.95]It's coming at me.
[291:49.97]Get hit by it.
[291:51.23]So I can justify putting it in my loadout for this Michonne.
[291:58.33]I'm just gonna be collecting... I wish the giant tank I spent the entire level building up to could have driven...
[292:07.30]I'd be in that right now.
[292:08.22]EDF 4?
[292:13.80]We're getting boxes.
[292:15.28]Isn't this EDF 4?
[292:17.08]EDF 4.1.
[292:17.94]Oh.
[292:18.42]That guy must love the classic version.
[292:25.11]It's only started changing and Jeff Cracklin's just an idiot.
[292:31.07]Boxes, boxes.
[292:32.11]I see a box down there.
[292:45.92]I see another box over here.
[292:50.44]Okay.
[292:51.26]Oh, there's one on the roof.
[292:55.07]Oh, did we get them all?
[292:55.95]I think I... There's two over here.
[292:57.41]Ah, no, I don't have a boost.
[292:59.57]I can't get it.
[293:02.11]Shit.
[293:02.55]Okay.
[293:03.13]Damn.
[293:06.74]I got new things.
[293:08.58]I did too, but they're all kind of bad.
[293:09.78]Ugh.
[293:12.50]Ugh.
[293:15.04]All right.
[293:17.32]I'm going to mute you for a second.
[293:20.36]Get muted.
[293:23.20]Hi, guys.
[293:26.20]Do level 10 on higher difficulty.
[293:27.95]Will it affect drops?
[293:28.67]I think it will.
[293:30.53]Yeah, we hit this wall in level 11 where it just got really, really, really hard on hard difficulty.
[293:37.75]But that's kind of a good thing because that means that it's not just a game you can steamroll.
[293:43.91]So that's good.
[293:47.35]But yeah, just wanted to try it.
[293:50.67]Might play some more off stream.
[293:52.05]Might play it on stream.
[293:52.96]I don't know.
[293:53.24]It depends on how much more me and Star continue to play it.
[293:57.76]But that's going to do it.
[294:00.36]Thank you everybody for sticking around.
[294:01.62]We're going to have the talk now.
[294:03.74]The birds and the bees talk.
[294:04.70]Yep.
[294:06.26]No, I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[294:08.04]Tuesday is going to be a crazy stream because that's when The Last Guardian comes out.
[294:14.03]And I plan on playing The Last Guardian.
[294:16.33]I've been waiting for that game for a long time.
[294:19.35]So, I don't have any plans to do any weekend streams.
[294:24.39]But, we'll see.
[294:26.42]Maybe.
[294:27.56]It depends on how I feel.
[294:29.34]If not, then The Last Guardian Tuesday.
[294:30.68]And then Dead Rising 4 comes out also on fucking Tuesday, doesn't it?
[294:35.49]There's a lot of shit to do, potentially, over the next three or four days.
[294:43.89]Is Guardian on PC?
[294:44.79]No, it's PS4 only.
[294:47.13]So hopefully the last Guardian will be worth waiting for.
[294:49.81]It was supposed to come out a long time ago.
[294:54.30]24-hour stream.
[294:58.16]Depends on how much fun I'm having.
[294:59.10]I don't know.
[295:01.28]Nobody's talked about Dead Rising 4.
[295:02.80]I know, it's crazy.
[295:05.65]It just kind of crept up on everybody.
[295:11.03]But before I go, I want to say thanks to Draconian Argonian for the sub.
[295:16.38]Axton Daily for eight months.
[295:18.22]And Meandstar Best Friends Forever.
[295:19.66]Maybe like a six on the friend meter, I'd say, at this point.
[295:25.03]It's not terrible.
[295:25.69]That's not great.
[295:26.17]It's not bad.
[295:26.99]It's not good.
[295:27.95]But, you know, it's good.
[295:28.65]It's good enough.
[295:30.97]Skate 3 Saturday?
[295:32.15]Not a fucking chance, man.
[295:36.99]But yeah, thanks a lot, guys, for the subs.
[295:38.53]Drones, EXE, 2Quickie, Sirzik, I think I got these guys already.
[295:41.21]Thanks a lot, everybody.
[295:44.23]TacoTurt for 310 bits.
[295:45.75]Here's to my 1,000th bit badge through ads only.
[295:49.97]Well, that's very kind of you, dude.
[295:52.97]That's dedication.
[295:57.59]But that's going to be it for tonight.
[296:01.28]Much love, guys.
[296:01.86]See you on Tuesday.
[296:02.54]And make sure you follow Star.
[296:05.16]He's a fucking streamer.
[296:08.35]I might also do the movies too.
[296:10.15]That was a ton of fun.
[296:12.99]Only a six.
[296:13.67]He's like a fucking seven.
[296:17.27]Good night, guys.
[296:17.73]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[296:20.60]I don't know why I just did that.
[296:21.64]I don't know why I'm blowing you kisses.
[296:23.90]Well, it happened.
[296:25.62]Have a good night.
[296:27.14]Goodbye.
