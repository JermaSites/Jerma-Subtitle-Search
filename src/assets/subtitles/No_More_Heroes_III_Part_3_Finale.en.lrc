[00:03.20]hello yeah sorry about that I was I was ready to go uh but uh Mr. Otto I did the thing where he runs around the circle sprints dive bombs your knees says get me outside now I did being early yesterday really took it out of him
[00:28.85]You're a baby.
[00:30.23]I'm not the baby.
[00:31.16]I'm taking care of my baby, Otto.
[00:33.94]Did you understand?
[00:34.54]Oh, pound it.
[00:43.34]You got it.
[00:43.70]Alright, yeah, so today, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I tweeted.
[00:49.26]We're good.
[00:49.82]I'm proud to tell you, look, my tweet was ready.
[00:52.20]My tweet went up before the stream went up.
[00:54.48]That's how you know I was ready.
[00:58.70]Every other stream, I sit there, I press live, and I go, oh, I forgot to tweet.
[01:06.35]Hold on, give me a second.
[01:08.15]That's my proof to you that I was ready.
[01:12.64]But we're going to do No More Heroes 3 finale today.
[01:16.26]I believe there's only about two or three more hours left in the game.
[01:20.22]And then from there, we're going to move back to WarioWare.
[01:25.49]Hopefully get to level 50 in Super Hard.
[01:31.57]You said Spore?
[01:32.41]Oh, you're talking about the title.
[01:36.08]It does say, it does say like Spore save file.
[01:42.70]Okay, maybe I should change that.
[01:45.32]It says Suda51's Spore save file.
[01:48.60]But that's like a reference to like how fucked up this game is and all the characters are like Spore characters and like WWE 2K characters.
[01:55.56]That was a joke.
[01:56.88]Is it misleading?
[01:57.96]Alright, I'll change it.
[01:58.88]I'll change it.
[01:59.40]I'll change it.
[01:59.86]I'll change it.
[02:00.30]Is that misleading?
[02:02.50]You think it's too misleading?
[02:03.68]That was a joke we made like a week ago.
[02:09.81]How about I... Okay, how about this?
[02:11.47]I got it.
[02:11.95]I got it.
[02:12.45]I got it.
[02:12.77]I got the fix.
[02:14.45]How about I change the title to What I Imagine Suda51's Spore Save File Looks Like.
[02:23.46]That's so wordy.
[02:24.72]I actually kind of like it Yeah, I like that I like that it sucks We just place for I'm gonna put what I am yeah, yeah, okay.
[02:38.61]I got it.
[02:38.97]Don't worry.
[02:40.77]I'm gonna change the title I can't change the title of my own stream.
[02:46.90]Why?
[02:50.09]I don't understand.
[02:51.89]Edit stream info is grayed out.
[02:56.41]What is... Okay, I just hit... I just pressed the cancel button.
[03:01.22]I don't know what happened.
[03:02.32]Did something happen?
[03:05.52]It was just a cancel button that I could press on the top of my screen.
[03:09.56]And I just pressed cancel.
[03:11.98]Did I just log off?
[03:13.26]I have no idea.
[03:13.81]Here we go.
[03:15.07]Here we go.
[03:18.22]How about here?
[03:18.68]What I imagine Suda51's forced save file looks like.
[03:24.50]There, are you happy?
[03:34.97]I like that.
[03:40.77]I like that.
[03:41.29]Alright, let's go.
[03:49.57]Hey, can you not stream?
[03:54.76]Why is it in brackets?
[03:55.70]Because, like, that's me thinking.
[03:58.56]That's, that's what I imagine a suda51 spore save file looks like.
[04:07.11]That's internal monolog.
[04:12.27]Oh, don't, okay, now here we go.
[04:13.45]Now you're all gonna tell me you don't have an internal monolog, right?
[04:17.44]Chat can't rotate a cube in their head, omegalol, right?
[04:21.04]Is this, are we gonna go down this road again?
[04:23.32]If they laugh.
[04:36.33]Alright, let's go.
[04:36.95]A title's fixed, it's fine.
[04:40.87]Everyone was like, holy shit, how did you get that?
[04:44.15]What?
[04:47.32]Whatever.
[04:47.60]Alright, we're going back.
[04:50.08]Alright, let's play.
[04:51.86]By the way, I need to make this really clear.
[04:53.36]This is the end of the game.
[04:57.76]If you are very excited to get your hands on No More Heroes 3 eventually, you're about to see the last third of the whole game.
[05:05.43]Just want to make that really clear.
[05:09.71]You ready?
[05:09.93]Okay.
[05:12.31]Okay.
[05:17.52]And then after this, we are going to go... Dude, I almost said no more heroes.
[05:24.43]But that's what we're doing right now.
[05:26.47]WarioWare.
[05:28.37]On the same console.
[05:29.15]It'll be a very easy switch.
[05:36.93]Okay, so first things first, I'm going to try to get to at least 20.
[05:40.28]Because I had 20 before.
[05:47.29]This just is WarioWare.
[05:48.39]I might as well be playing WarioWare again.
[05:50.03]Those of you asking for a facecam, nope.
[05:58.54]It's not going on until WarioWare.
[06:00.54]Maybe if you're good, it'll turn on once this stream here for the next like two hours.
[06:04.74]Dude, you forgot to start streaming.
[06:15.24]Facecam on no balls.
[06:16.70]It doesn't matter.
[06:17.26]I don't care.
[06:19.50]Facecam does not matter to me.
[06:20.52]It's not going on.
[06:23.34]What if I say please?
[06:30.04]Okay.
[06:31.73]Okay.
[06:32.15]They said please.
[06:32.67]They did.
[06:33.95]You did.
[06:34.19]You said please.
[06:35.79]That one person said please.
[06:39.09]In the sea of demanding chatters.
[06:41.63]What's up, huh?
[06:45.34]There you go.
[06:48.98]I'm going back to 2012 Jerma when I wore just muscle shirts every day.
[06:52.22]Remember that?
[06:52.56]Remember that arc?
[06:53.18]It's coming back.
[07:04.81]By the way, you get this until this minigame is over.
[07:17.82]This is boring.
[07:19.90]Oh, that was not you guys saying that.
[07:22.06]That was the game saying that.
[07:23.58]Space game's going off.
[07:24.97]Thanks, everybody.
[07:25.43]Now we're going to play the game.
[07:28.55]Just have to get ready.
[07:30.23]I got 20 points in that.
[07:35.95]It doesn't matter.
[07:36.37]What was the last thing we were just doing in No More Heroes 3?
[07:43.12]How much money do I have?
[07:45.48]Alright, I just had done the last thing, so let's go.
[07:56.84]Or I'll have the beard.
[07:57.50]No, the beard actually has to get shaved.
[08:00.10]Tonight.
[08:01.36]The only reason why I didn't do it last night, or the night before, is because I knew I was going to probably have the facecam on for a portion of the stream.
[08:07.92]And as you all know, I don't like the way that I look with a clean, shaved face.
[08:12.90]I don't like it.
[08:13.40]It makes me look weird.
[08:15.38]So I have this rule where I am not, and this is, I'm not kidding.
[08:18.61]People think this is a joke, but there's a lot of new viewers.
[08:20.43]I need to make sure the new viewers know this too.
[08:23.63]I only go into public, and I only show my face to people after two days have gone by after shaving my face.
[08:33.22]So I have, I plan my get-togethers around if two days will have gone by after shaving.
[08:40.56]So let's say I get invited to do something.
[08:42.58]Hey man, what are you up to on Saturday night?
[08:45.70]And it's Friday.
[08:46.88]Like Friday afternoon.
[08:48.48]I'm like, oh, I got some stuff going on.
[08:53.30]Oh, you sure?
[08:53.90]No, I got some stuff going on, sorry.
[08:56.58]What are you doing on Sunday night?
[08:57.80]Or Monday afternoon?
[09:01.80]Uh, nothing.
[09:02.48]Perfect.
[09:02.96]I'm going to be free on Monday afternoon.
[09:05.51]Exactly two to three days after shaving.
[09:12.13]conventions and get-togethers, meetups, every time a TwitchCon happened or every time a PAX would happen,
[09:19.68]I would shave... Okay, so on day one of a PAX, right, most people are kind of coming in.
[09:27.17]And people aren't necessarily seeing each other.
[09:30.69]It's like, oh, you come in, you travel, it's a travel day.
[09:32.65]Everyone's like, oh, I'm gonna get in, it's gonna be like 8 o'clock, I'm sleepy, I'm gonna sleep at the hotel.
[09:36.47]I would shave that morning, because it was guaranteed I wasn't gonna see anybody.
[09:40.80]Except, like, whatever, people on the plane, but I don't care.
[09:43.49]And then, like, a full day would go by.
[09:45.25]Day one.
[09:45.86]Like, that's day zero, Pax.
[09:47.14]Like, day one of Pax will be one full day.
[09:50.56]I know that all the people do stuff on the Saturday nights, which would be two full days.
[09:54.98]So, therefore, like, for the actual time when I know I'm gonna see people, I look my best.
[09:59.34]Two full days go by.
[10:00.73]I get that slight five o'clock shadow.
[10:02.71]Go watch the Dollhouse streams.
[10:05.03]Go turn on day one of the Dollhouse streams.
[10:06.81]That was exactly 48 hours.
[10:09.49]To the moment the stream started.
[10:12.11]That I shaved.
[10:15.80]Just get a trimmer.
[10:16.92]No, I can't get a... I don't like trimmers.
[10:19.38]Trimmers make me break out bad.
[10:23.01]I've tried to use an electric... And by the way, half the time those things don't even fucking do anything.
[10:29.05]I have had nice beard trimmers and electric razors.
[10:32.59]You just... Your face is a hair minefield.
[10:35.54]They don't do anything.
[10:36.48]I've never had one that actually works well.
[10:40.68]I will go by... And it's like, okay, there's still all the hair is still there.
[10:48.03]And now my face just is stinging and hurts, and I'm gonna have like a breakout tomorrow.
[10:52.81]I've tried every kind of... I've tried it every time.
[11:01.40]Is this the... Have I done this one?
[11:13.33]Just get a beard.
[11:15.03]No, I can't grow beards.
[11:16.33]It has to be two days without shaving.
[11:22.05]Then it's perfect.
[11:30.85]It's a pretty good song for this.
[11:49.75]Oh, got it.
[11:52.17]Shave on screen.
[11:52.99]I already did.
[11:57.97]By the way, I'm in one of those moods again today.
[12:01.55]I don't know what it is.
[12:02.58]Where is it?
[12:03.08]There it is.
[12:24.16]Trash.
[12:25.08]Trash.
[12:27.04]Come on, trash.
[12:29.16]Trash.
[12:33.14]There's still trash over here.
[12:35.40]Oh my god.
[12:37.01]I don't like these missions.
[12:37.75]These are my least favorite.
[12:42.19]These are my least favorite missions in the whole game.
[12:51.27]Where is it?
[13:00.57]That's got to be close, right?
[13:07.52]Well, I didn't get it all.
[13:10.44]I didn't get it all.
[13:16.38]Whatever.
[13:16.64]I don't like these ones.
[13:20.44]Trying to make money.
[13:26.19]Bronze, whatever.
[13:28.63]It's money.
[13:34.26]That's money.
[13:36.79]If level 3 opens up, I just really don't want to do it.
[13:38.63]As much as I love this game, and I love, like, completing a lot of the stuff, yeah, Nuvala, whatever, I'll do it.
[13:44.11]Fine, it's right here.
[13:44.79]I don't care.
[13:46.77]I'm gonna pay attention to this.
[13:53.20]Oh.
[13:54.18]Does that mean that there's one hidden somewhere?
[14:02.64]I don't get it.
[14:09.04]I think that's what that means that sucks oh get out of here
[14:26.16]Hey, get out, get out of here.
[14:27.12]Get out of here.
[14:28.52]No, we have to move on from that.
[14:29.88]I love that reference and it's a really funny video and it's a really interesting community joke.
[14:35.24]But I can't just do the seal every day.
[14:37.26]I have to, I can't, I gotta move on.
[14:43.40]Maybe it's just so interesting that I'm allowed to do it more than once a week.
[14:52.81]I don't want to go too far up because I want to just go through the middle.
[15:02.80]What do you guys think?
[15:03.32]What's the amount of time that we're allowed to be stuck on one reference or one joke for the streams?
[15:10.22]Now that I'm only live like once or twice a week.
[15:14.13]I think it's probably two weeks.
[15:22.95]Three months!
[15:27.86]I think that's too long.
[15:32.21]Come on, where is it?
[15:36.29]How are you ever supposed to reliably do this in this amount of time?
[15:39.82]Depends on how funny you think it is.
[15:50.22]That's a good point, you're right.
[15:56.99]Eren should be forever.
[15:57.95]Eren was supposed to be, like, a day.
[16:05.29]Eren way overstayed its welcome and became something that you guys now actually want to hear all the time, which is bizarre to me.
[16:13.41]And Lala, too.
[16:15.61]People unsubscribed because of Lala.
[16:18.33]You understand that?
[16:18.89]Do you know that that happened?
[16:23.13]Oh, fuck.
[16:24.33]I'm gonna lose.
[16:36.01]Almost lost.
[16:39.53]3, 2, 1.
[16:40.15]Got it.
[16:41.67]Okay.
[16:42.27]I don't care if it's bronze.
[16:43.17]I'm just trying to get through them.
[16:46.03]Get the non-believers out of here.
[16:51.66]I just want the medal so I can unlock the next level.
[16:53.54]3,500.
[16:53.56]Nice.
[16:56.46]Level 4.
[17:05.69]Alright.
[17:07.33]I don't need to do it again.
[17:08.01]Bronze.
[17:19.92]Is there anything else I can do?
[17:21.34]What do we got going on here?
[17:22.81]Head to the Thunderdome.
[17:23.91]Okay.
[17:25.03]Fine.
[17:27.19]Just trying to make a little bit of extra cash before we go.
[17:29.87]Thunderdome.
[17:37.92]Can a kangaroo walk backwards?
[17:40.76]Probably hop backwards.
[17:45.75]Maybe?
[17:50.49]Or can they?
[17:50.89]I don't know.
[17:51.45]I have no idea.
[17:51.91]Alright, back in the Thunderdome.
[17:58.80]Alright.
[18:00.04]Head to the Thunderdome.
[18:01.26]Find it.
[18:01.64]Okay, we just have to do designated matches.
[18:04.78]I gotta remember how to play the video game because it has been a while.
[18:11.55]Let's go to these ones up here.
[18:12.21]Looking for a match.
[18:21.49]This game sucks.
[18:22.65]With two C's.
[18:28.35]Can I ask you guys something?
[18:30.91]I think we have a fairly... There's a fairly large zoomer population here, I think, right?
[18:35.91]What do you, as the potential zoomer population...
[18:40.48]What, like, kind of your generational slang or your generational terms do you not like the most?
[18:47.88]What do you think?
[18:49.88]What's like your, like, not even like slang, but what's your, like, generational thing that you guys have that you like the least?
[19:00.24]Blit?
[19:01.31]Fringe?
[19:03.31]Sus?
[19:05.19]Fortnite?
[19:11.95]Sus.
[19:14.29]I'm not sure Sus will continue to... I don't know.
[19:16.65]I don't think Sus will live as long as we think it will.
[19:19.67]Hold on.
[19:22.77]Hold on.
[19:23.23]Hold on.
[19:23.53]Remember how to play the game Andy, right?
[19:27.08]That's not even a place where that works.
[19:30.94]Hey, you know what my favorite is?
[19:32.82]My favorite is Andy.
[19:34.52]That's my favorite.
[19:38.74]I have like a powerful move right now.
[19:45.97]Oh my goodness, we're about to kill everybody in the room.
[19:53.41]Right, I have these moves.
[19:54.33]Okay, cool.
[19:56.07]Game's a little loud, I think, isn't it?
[19:58.14]I think it's loud.
[20:04.84]Handy.
[20:06.68]Oh my god, I got it again!
[20:08.34]All green mode?
[20:09.06]Alright, I gotta get in the middle.
[20:10.42]Everybody can see me.
[20:13.18]And... Ha!
[20:19.68]It's you!
[20:20.40]You gotta be the worst.
[20:22.04]What are you talking about?
[20:22.92]Wait, hold on.
[20:25.86]You just threw me off big time right now.
[20:28.90]What do you mean?
[20:32.01]I just freaked out.
[20:32.67]What are you talking about?
[20:33.87]Me?
[20:40.17]I'm the worst zoomer thing?
[20:44.73]Is that technically true?
[20:50.55]You got me all fucked up right now.
[20:53.27]That's technically a true statement.
[21:03.50]Eee!
[21:05.78]Ego obliterated.
[21:07.28]I'm d- Oh, I'm dead.
[21:08.94]I- You just really screwed my whole thing up here.
[21:12.32]You just shattered my entire world view of everything.
[21:16.67]Let me turn the game down a little.
[21:18.83]What the fuck?
[21:25.34]Damn, that's based.
[21:31.08]I don't think based is a zoomer thing.
[21:32.32]I think that was around when... Like, more than 10 years ago, wasn't it?
[21:35.72]Alright, let me get back into this.
[21:39.12]Okay.
[21:50.11]Sussy Baka is the worst one.
[21:51.83]Why is it giving this shit to me?
[21:58.46]Why is it giving this to me?
[21:59.74]I must be really mad that I'm like doing so poorly.
[22:02.65]Based is old.
[22:07.65]Yeah, based is really old.
[22:08.99]Based is not even like in the last 10 years.
[22:17.73]He's not dead?
[22:18.29]What just happened?
[22:32.93]Based, based, cringe, cringe.
[22:42.84]That was $10,000 for that?
[22:43.84]What the hell?
[22:48.91]Onions, onions.
[22:53.48]Hey, dude, I think we need a rock outbreak.
[22:55.24]It's been 15 minutes.
[22:57.78]I think I'm confined.
[22:58.60]I think I'm gonna be okay.
[23:08.24]There's a bike there.
[23:09.78]And we're off.
[23:18.34]I was trying to drive- I thought I could drive over that.
[23:26.72]You know, I want there to be studies done on things.
[23:30.38]Like, for instance, has- is pepperoni, like, has there been a percentile lossage in if pepperoni is everyone's favorite topping generation to generation?
[23:40.63]You know what I mean?
[23:43.05]Like, okay, from boomers to millennial to zoomers, is pepperoni- did we lose any percentage points?
[23:50.10]What's a zoomer's favorite pizza topping, right?
[23:53.60]What's a millennial's favorite pizza topping?
[23:55.08]Fuck.
[24:01.85]Is that universally the best pizza topping that everyone agrees on?
[24:08.60]I wonder.
[24:09.00]That stuff kind of intrigues me.
[24:24.48]Black olives?
[24:25.04]Because, like, those tastes don't change.
[24:35.11]Like, pepperoni universally, like, 80% of people like on their pizza.
[24:38.81]Like, doesn't matter what generation or who you are, where you are.
[24:41.95]That's interesting, isn't it?
[24:48.10]Start the game!
[24:53.07]Three of these guys.
[24:53.81]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[24:55.55]These guys are horrible.
[25:02.38]These guys are the worst enemy.
[25:11.03]Jesus.
[25:14.51]I can't see.
[25:15.03]I've been jumping around.
[25:15.87]It freaks me out.
[25:16.63]I don't like the jumping.
[25:24.91]I feel like I just play... I'm in a game of Overwatch right there.
[25:33.17]Do we talk about particle effects in games and how, like, they've gone way too overboard?
[25:37.26]Have we talked about that yet?
[25:41.64]I know that I've talked about that.
[25:43.06]Like, I want less particle effects in video games, not more.
[25:50.76]I'm fucking dead.
[25:52.78]Those guys, I was on the ground, I just got comboed.
[26:00.51]Alright, this is a good warm-up period.
[26:01.75]I'm just warming up.
[26:02.39]I haven't played this game in like a week.
[26:09.87]Give me a break.
[26:19.35]Wait.
[26:24.37]Alright, that's better.
[26:34.82]Come on, come on in.
[26:36.59]Come on, wait.
[26:39.21]Did I miss?
[26:40.67]What happened?
[26:42.40]Get over here.
[26:56.08]Anyways, what was it?
[26:56.66]Oh, yeah.
[26:57.35]Particle effects in video games.
[27:00.15]For some reason, a trend started happening in the last 10 years that I'm really not a fan of.
[27:05.15]And it's when particle effects take over the entire video game.
[27:10.11]I'm going to say something here that's going to make a lot of people probably upset.
[27:13.43]I don't know.
[27:13.89]It might.
[27:14.35]Because I don't think I've talked about this specific instance in this.
[27:18.13]I just remember...
[27:23.00]Personal opinion.
[27:23.90]Personal opinion.
[27:24.82]This is not... I don't care.
[27:25.80]I think it's a great series.
[27:27.28]It's an incredible franchise.
[27:28.98]I love it.
[27:29.46]I played hundreds, if not potentially thousands of hours of this franchise.
[27:33.15]I'm going to die if I stop talking.
[27:35.77]I'll talk about it after.
[27:36.67]I'm going to die.
[27:38.11]And it's going to be your... No, it's not.
[27:39.77]It's my fault.
[27:42.53]I brought this up.
[27:43.23]It's not your fault.
[27:47.35]Okay.
[27:47.51]Anyways, listen.
[27:49.26]So... Super Smash Brothers...
[27:54.00]The new iterations of the game, the last two iterations, the particle effects are so outrageous to me, in my brain.
[28:02.69]Like punching and kicking and jumping, they like, these huge, massive particle effects.
[28:13.53]I like the game, I think it's a really great game, but every time I like punch and kick somebody, it's like, you see these giant flashing clouds appear over everybody's head.
[28:31.75]It's almost, like, hard sometimes to see, like, okay, I'm doing a combo.
[28:35.23]I see these, like, two or three giant flashes of big, bright clouds of sparkles and explosions of people.
[28:40.91]I want less.
[28:44.94]And now that I said that, I'm sorry that I just, I, people that are gonna, you, if you play that game, and you're a fan of it, you are now going to see what I'm talking about, and I may have just fucked up your entire view of that game.
[28:55.06]I'm sorry.
[29:09.58]I think that's why I like the Souls series.
[29:13.04]You may have just come up with a reason why, even though those games are kind of hard and somewhat frustrating and annoying to me, that it is one of my favorite franchises ever.
[29:25.31]That's a really good point.
[29:27.91]Because there's no extra shit added on those games.
[29:31.39]If I punch somebody, or if I slash somebody with a sword, in, um, what the fuck?
[29:37.16]In Dark Souls, the sword just hits them.
[29:40.22]A gigantic, bright particle cloud of bright colors and explosions don't come out of their body.
[29:46.30]I don't like that trend.
[29:51.11]Over-stimulation.
[29:51.99]Yeah, it's just over-stimulating.
[29:53.59]Like, headache-inducing in a way.
[29:58.41]He hates this game.
[29:59.69]No!
[30:03.51]This blood?
[30:04.63]Yeah, but there's a difference between like blood coming out and like bright sparkly explosions and huge smoke particle effects coming out when you touch somebody.
[30:20.39]I heard that Mass Effect 2 does not have that.
[30:28.30]So, this is a roundabout way of you saying that this should be blood and smash.
[30:33.94]Oh my god.
[30:37.65]I'm sorry.
[30:48.26]I'll be really honest with you.
[30:50.91]And I have to be, because if I'm not honest with you, then I can't be honest with myself, right?
[30:56.25]If there was blood and smash besides the giant, huge, bright flash of particle effects every time you hit somebody, I would probably like the game more.
[31:04.13]It's very easy to say that.
[31:19.81]Not I'm not listen to me.
[31:22.53]I'm not saying that I would prefer it I'm just saying that like there would be less on the screen I Just want less stuff on the screen when I hit stuff.
[31:32.79]That's it I'm going this way He wants to see Mario bleed no, I just want to see Mario have I want less stuff on the screen I
[32:00.20]You want Mario dead You're a psycho I'm not though I know this people here that agree with me that want to see less Obscene particle explosions every time they I every time they see anything.
[32:14.88]Oh, I thought the game crashed Spin death throw
[32:25.27]I know these people would agree with me.
[32:26.43]I know they're into it.
[32:28.13]What did happen?
[32:30.49]I come!
[32:31.15]You're literally the only one.
[32:36.97]No, I can't do this.
[32:39.67]I can't be.
[32:40.34]That's why I couldn't really... That's why I didn't care about Overwatch.
[32:54.67]It's the way that you phrased it.
[33:09.95]What, because I said I would rather there be blood in Smash Bros.
[33:12.68]than bright particle effects?
[33:15.86]I'm not talking about Mortal Kombat levels of blood.
[33:20.90]Oh shit, this is bad.
[33:21.98]This is a horrible place to fight everybody.
[33:27.89]Are they gonna get... Yeah, be careful here.
[33:31.37]Invincible.
[33:32.22]Oh, thank god.
[33:44.65]What?
[33:45.31]Why are they staying alive after that?
[33:47.73]I'm...
[33:56.97]All the stupid particle effects!
[33:58.61]Are these my screen?
[34:01.14]Whatever.
[34:27.04]Pretending to be bad again.
[34:36.99]Do the mission.
[34:38.61]This is the mission.
[34:39.47]This is the game.
[34:40.11]I have to make enough money from doing the jobs in the mission.
[34:42.35]Come on!
[34:50.76]That's so stupid.
[34:54.96]Oh, whatever.
[34:56.29]Who cares?
[35:06.33]What else do you want blood in?
[35:08.13]I don't want blood in Smash Brothers.
[35:10.75]I just said that I prefer less stuff on the screen.
[35:14.09]And like a blood like splatter would be way less than like the smoke explosions.
[35:22.58]Let's get this over
[35:24.46]You're putting words in my mouth.
[35:25.72]Stop it.
[35:33.39]Let's kill.
[35:35.16]I gotta get rid of these guys first.
[35:36.38]These guys are the worst.
[35:53.17]What about Wii Sports?
[35:55.99]I don't know what you're talking about.
[35:58.99]Why would there be blood in Wii Sports?
[36:08.72]Ouch.
[36:09.60]Come on.
[36:11.38]What about boxing in Wii Sports?
[36:12.90]But there's... Okay.
[36:15.88]Comedy violence is different than mature violence.
[36:21.43]Dude, Tom and Jerry.
[36:23.35]Tom used to get like a hammer smashed on his hand.
[36:26.37]And like shot in the face and stuff.
[36:29.71]Like Jerry used to fucking torture that guy.
[36:32.77]But there was no blood.
[36:44.32]I think he may have gotten like a black eye or something, right?
[36:58.21]But when Tom hit Jerry with the hammer, sparkly, gigantic particle smoke did not come out of Tom's hand.
[37:06.53]That's the point.
[37:15.90]He got his teeth knocked in.
[37:22.86]No, it didn't.
[37:23.86]There was no, like, big flash particle, like, camera flash.
[37:30.13]And, like, sparkles and big smoke.
[37:33.11]Boom!
[37:34.07]No, he just got his hand smashed with a hammer.
[37:54.37]Why?
[37:54.81]Okay.
[37:56.59]Alright, I'm moving on from this.
[37:58.23]We've been on this for too long.
[38:07.51]I'm going to try to do this one again.
[38:13.15]How will you know if it's next gen if there's not millions of particles?
[38:18.47]You know, that's probably the reason why a lot of games slow down too.
[38:23.63]Is that what happened?
[38:25.33]Have we plateaued in graphics that we have not plateaued in the amount of shit that they can put on the screen in particle effects?
[38:30.29]I think you figured it out.
[38:49.76]Style is becoming more important.
[38:53.69]Today is the particle rant stream.
[39:01.19]Not.
[39:01.43]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[39:04.94]Yeah, it takes way too long.
[39:10.26]Alright.
[39:11.18]I don't want to fall in the lava, but man, you gotta fight the people down there.
[39:13.67]That sucks.
[39:22.84]Is this game good?
[39:23.48]This game is very good.
[39:25.96]It's really difficult for me to rate it and tell you what you shouldn't.
[39:31.06]This game is really not very good at all.
[39:33.61]I really recommend you don't purchase it.
[39:36.37]It's probably the worst in the series, out of the three at least, in the main series.
[39:54.10]No, it's good.
[39:54.86]It's really good.
[39:56.24]I think this is probably my favorite one out of the three.
[40:09.06]This is my last time I'm going to try this.
[40:10.32]Okay, the amount of time I've taken trying to do this mission, I could have already made $10,000 doing the fight missions.
[40:21.35]Ow.
[40:24.10]So, let's not screw it up this time.
[40:32.17]Hang a right.
[40:32.83]I don't even want to know what level 3 this is, or level 4.
[40:42.51]It's probably so awful.
[40:43.51]Alright, nothing this way, right?
[40:46.28]I have plenty of time.
[40:49.66]I'm not worried about the time.
[40:55.43]Move!
[40:55.57]Out of the fucking way!
[40:56.63]Alright, let's go this way.
[41:03.27]Fight!
[41:03.61]Fight!
[41:04.67]Oh, he did a Lord of the Rings beatbox!
[41:11.52]Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
[41:14.04]He's done that like a thousand times!
[41:15.54]I've heard that a million times before!
[41:17.20]He doesn't have any other material in his jukebox!
[41:21.98]Hey!
[41:22.10]Raspberry!
[41:23.04]Double kick!
[41:30.41]Do the Tom.
[41:36.15]No.
[41:37.22]My voice is already fucked up this morning.
[41:39.86]Yelling at WarioWare.
[41:40.92]The 35 year old man.
[41:44.90]That's something I have to live with you know.
[41:53.93]I'm not 36 yet.
[41:54.67]Stop saying that.
[41:55.73]It's not accurate yet.
[41:58.31]Alright, what about up?
[42:03.55]Yeah, there's one up there.
[42:04.69]Is there anything left over here?
[42:05.83]God, I don't know.
[42:08.08]Jesus.
[42:11.70]Oh my god, it didn't register.
[42:14.44]It didn't register the click.
[42:15.84]Holy shit.
[42:16.62]Okay, I'm good.
[42:17.30]Alright, I gotta go up this way.
[42:24.88]Where is this?
[42:26.38]There it is.
[42:30.24]Four.
[42:32.30]Okay.
[42:38.79]Five, six.
[42:41.05]Don't fall in the middle.
[42:42.13]It's so easy to not fall in the middle.
[42:44.09]I don't- There's no timer right now.
[42:48.83]Oh my goodness.
[42:54.71]Don't dodge into the fire.
[42:57.71]Nice suplex into the fire.
[42:59.23]Where am I?
[42:59.71]Where am I?
[43:00.79]Where am I?
[43:22.43]What the fuck?
[43:23.79]Alright, I'm good.
[43:32.00]Five.
[43:32.30]Okay, there's one more.
[43:33.18]I don't know where it is, though.
[43:34.18]Wait for this to explode.
[43:36.88]Do I still eat dairy?
[43:40.61]A little.
[43:40.89]I don't drink any real milk or anything.
[43:44.01]Except for like a milkshake or ice cream or cheese.
[43:46.19]I mean, I don't.
[43:48.87]Not really.
[43:52.13]There it is.
[43:52.43]Alright, get me out of here.
[43:54.53]Yeah, I mean, I do.
[43:58.29]I still eat dairy.
[44:01.28]It's only from cheese and ice cream, though.
[44:03.32]That's really it.
[44:14.47]You see that?
[44:16.69]If I want milk in my coffee or milk with a brownie or something, it's usually almond milk or oat milk.
[44:24.27]One of those two.
[44:32.60]Cheese tier list.
[44:33.32]I've already did all the tier lists.
[44:43.38]New level is unlocked.
[44:44.40]Alright.
[44:44.92]Let's just see what it looks like because it's here.
[44:50.77]Oat milk is filled with canola oil.
[44:52.29]Omega low.
[44:52.77]Yeah, and apples have cyanide in it.
[44:54.13]Whatever.
[44:54.57]I'll see you in 10 years when they realize.
[44:56.29]See you in 25 years when drinking coffee actually kills you.
[44:59.19]I don't care.
[44:59.57]This is the banana radiation thing again.
[45:13.26]I don't care.
[45:18.94]Coffee's supposed to be good for your heart.
[45:20.10]Yeah, whatever.
[45:20.90]I'll see you in 50 years when they realize that there's a microorganism in coffee that is giving us all diseases.
[45:28.39]Okay, here's the real point.
[45:29.57]Everything sucks.
[45:30.85]Everything is bad for you.
[45:32.25]Eventually.
[45:42.96]I canceled it.
[45:43.54]I'm good.
[45:52.02]Alright, well that was cool.
[45:53.60]I need 50,000.
[45:54.00]I need to do a couple more missions.
[46:00.41]Coffee's worms.
[46:01.21]It has worms in it.
[46:01.97]Yeah, I don't know.
[46:02.47]Whatever.
[46:02.77]Here's the point.
[46:06.18]Treat your body well with whatever data and science that we have now.
[46:13.19]And that's it.
[46:14.53]Just, you know, eat what you want.
[46:17.41]Eat however you feel.
[46:18.46]Do whatever you want.
[46:20.20]Moderate it.
[46:20.78]Don't be crazy.
[46:21.76]Don't be out of your mind and like, oh, I only eat fucking McDonald's number twos.
[46:25.40]Like, don't do that.
[46:26.20]That's a dumb thing to do.
[46:32.41]Some light exercise if you need to.
[46:33.77]And you look.
[46:34.31]And then in like 100 years, they'll look back and they'll be like, are you kidding me?
[46:40.33]They were putting sugar.
[46:42.17]They were eating sugar?
[46:45.07]What were they thinking?
[46:49.03]Just wait.
[46:49.45]There will be a what were they thinking reference for the generations in 100 years.
[46:56.50]Hold on a minute, guys.
[46:57.88]Are you serious?
[47:01.54]They were eating the fruits off of trees?
[47:04.99]What?
[47:05.95]No, they were not.
[47:06.87]Why would they do that?
[47:09.07]We'll see in like 200 years.
[47:15.84]They were eating, they were eating, wait, meat from a cow?
[47:18.84]What the fuck?
[47:19.58]No, they were not.
[47:20.38]I don't believe that for a second.
[47:21.62]How could they do that?
[47:24.09]There'll be something.
[47:25.31]You just wait.
[47:26.53]We'll see what it is.
[47:37.45]They were drinking water?
[47:38.51]I don't know, man.
[47:42.03]There'll be something that we're doing right now that generations in the future are going to be shocked that we even thought it was a decent idea in the first place.
[47:50.37]I don't know what it is, but we won't know.
[47:55.63]Ooh, got a whole combo on him.
[48:28.66]I saw somebody say that oxygen was poisonous.
[48:33.70]I don't want to get too into this.
[48:35.66]Who said that?
[48:47.69]It is.
[48:48.25]I don't know.
[48:49.15]That's an unconfirmed statement.
[48:50.91]I can't agree or deny that one.
[48:54.62]It's unconfirmed.
[48:57.42]We read that shit every day.
[48:58.80]That's unconfirmed to me.
[49:06.35]I mean, technically it could be.
[49:09.35]Yeah, but isn't it like a blend?
[49:12.71]Don't we have an air cocktail that's not just oxygen?
[49:15.93]So, okay, maybe that might be accurate.
[49:17.67]I don't know.
[49:22.19]Yeah, we have an air cocktail.
[49:23.44]I get it.
[49:23.82]Yeah, whatever.
[49:24.58]It's like, I don't know, like hydrogen, oxygen...
[49:36.27]coriander, cadmium, whatever they are.
[49:40.47]There's all kinds of shit in our ear.
[49:42.51]Dust.
[49:46.92]Dude, Jeremiah, you are on hard drugs.
[50:04.84]No, you are right now seeing the reason why I was always afraid of ever doing a hard drug.
[50:10.62]Ever.
[50:12.26]I am completely drug-free.
[50:15.32]With the exception of Tylenol, Caffeine, and, you know, a little bit of Marijuana.
[50:20.04]I'm feeling okay.
[50:23.37]No, drug-free, man, I don't... I have no way.
[50:40.17]Don't do those all together.
[50:41.27]Okay.
[50:48.04]No, I'm talking about in separate occasions.
[50:56.46]No, look, you don't need more than that.
[51:00.06]Let's be really realistic here.
[51:03.77]Really, really hard shit that, like, really fucks you up and stuff.
[51:06.15]No, no, just, I'll take, a little bit of weed is fine.
[51:08.70]That's it.
[51:10.00]That's, I don't need, alcohol maybe a little bit sometimes.
[51:16.54]No, that's, anything more than that, no.
[51:19.29]It's not, it's not good.
[51:20.27]It's not good for you.
[51:20.99]It fucks up your head.
[51:22.13]Screws with you.
[51:23.09]This is what, like, no.
[51:27.15]I need an ATM.
[51:28.55]Where's there an ATM?
[51:29.42]Oh, right here.
[51:50.76]What about psychedelics?
[51:53.42]Um, I don't, I don't know enough about them.
[51:57.08]I know that there's some preliminary data, right, of people, um, there being some drug companies or some pharmaceutical companies that are experimenting with like low dose of psychedelics to treat some mental disorders, mental health problems, right?
[52:13.60]I don't know.
[52:16.98]I've heard that.
[52:21.93]I don't know.
[52:22.29]We'll see in like another 20 years what happens.
[52:24.08]15 years.
[52:29.52]I'm afraid of them.
[52:30.82]And I don't ever want to do them.
[52:41.39]They're experimenting with shrooms?
[52:43.11]I mean, I know that there is some drug companies that are, that have programs.
[52:47.13]Let's study.
[52:49.95]Very, very low doses of... Some psychedelics can actually help.
[52:55.64]I don't know.
[52:56.02]This is just really random shit that I have read.
[52:59.10]I have that correct, right?
[53:07.86]How nostalgic.
[53:09.70]We used to drink this after school.
[53:13.73]I always got Muscat, and you always got Kyoho.
[53:18.37]The sweetness of a grape really invigorates a tired body.
[53:22.80]It was a little treat to myself for working hard.
[53:27.38]Oh yeah, that stuff was good.
[53:30.56]It's all coming back to me now.
[53:32.96]So you remember things too, eh?
[53:35.14]You have, like, good memories and all?
[53:38.46]For most things, I sort of have to gather the pieces together, or I can't remember.
[53:43.58]I see.
[53:44.78]So you are a victim too.
[53:47.56]In that case, can't you just give up on this planet?
[53:51.29]Sonic?
[53:52.67]Are you... are you being serious?
[53:55.51]Yes.
[53:56.71]I think it's worth considering.
[53:59.25]I can't back down!
[54:00.51]You should know this!
[54:01.97]My family's destiny!
[54:04.28]Oh, that stuff again.
[54:05.44]Is that Charles from Red Dead?
[54:07.32]It is.
[54:07.66]That's not going to work.
[54:10.98]Are you backing out on me, Sonic?
[54:14.16]I will not back out.
[54:16.18]I will follow your orders.
[54:18.60]But I do hope that you will back out.
[54:22.56]The future?
[54:23.90]Can you see it?
[54:24.64]I... I'm not sure.
[54:30.55]I must go.
[54:32.51]What's the future like?
[54:34.07]I will tell you when I get back.
[54:37.15]Make sure you come back, Sonic Juice.
[54:40.29]Next time, let's try some peach juice.
[54:50.38]I can't do psychedelics.
[54:51.97]I would never do it.
[54:57.11]Because I like to be close to... I don't like the idea of being able to be potentially disconnected from reality.
[55:03.32]I feel like I would have a panic attack.
[55:05.64]I think I would have a meltdown or something.
[55:07.74]I don't know if I could do it.
[55:11.44]No, I don't think so.
[55:13.22]And that's okay, right?
[55:14.72]That's completely fine.
[55:16.26]I don't have to do any of those things.
[55:22.71]I know the things that I know that I can do and I can handle.
[55:28.10]Obviously, I don't, you know, I want to make sure I'm not, you know, like get hurt or hurt myself or something in the process, right?
[55:34.10]You want to, even with something like that, like, like marijuana or alcohol, you're going to be careful.
[55:41.04]You don't want to just like fuck up and fuck your head up and shit.
[55:43.30]And, you know, I think about how many times, um, or people, you know, have you heard of somebody that like, you know, you drink too much, right?
[55:50.04]That's, that sucks.
[55:52.48]That sucks.
[55:56.71]All these things come with potential consequences, so just be careful.
[56:04.58]Alright, do I have enough to do this?
[56:08.64]I definitely do.
[56:09.26]Alright, do I care about health or damage?
[56:19.44]I feel like I'm whooping everybody's ass, so might as well dial that up to 100.
[56:32.31]What's the best way to lose weight?
[56:37.60]I really don't know.
[56:38.28]I've never been in that position before where I've had to.
[56:42.80]So, I'm not the one that can answer that question for you.
[56:45.24]Do I have enough to do this?
[56:51.04]Oh!
[57:06.65]Do I have enough money to buy any of these?
[57:09.23]Calories in, calories out.
[57:11.73]Yeah, I was, I mean, if I were to try to do it, which I'll be honest, probably, I'm probably gonna have to do that.
[57:19.39]Because I like slingshotted myself.
[57:28.14]I lost a bunch of weight a year or two ago.
[57:31.52]All the medical bullshit.
[57:35.08]And then I gained it back, and I tried to get on a program to get it all back, and then it kept going, and then I kept going.
[57:41.39]So I went from 129, I think my lowest was 128 pounds.
[57:50.31]And then I went from that to like 145.
[57:51.63]And I was like, alright, this is perfect.
[57:54.29]I'm done.
[57:54.83]I did it.
[57:56.01]And then like a couple, like three or four months later, I looked at the scale and I was like, holy shit, I'm 163 pounds.
[58:01.63]How?
[58:02.10]When did that happen?
[58:05.30]Like I went way too far back and way too far forward.
[58:11.00]I gained like an extra 10 pounds in like three or four months somehow.
[58:18.48]So now I have to kind of do, eventually here, I got to do the pullback, where I get a little bit more physically active.
[58:28.13]Some more weight training maybe, maybe very lightly, but it's hard because... Kind of chest and back problem that I have.
[58:36.86]It's kind of a pain in the ass to exercise for more than a few times.
[58:41.51]Because I'll exercise, and I'll be like, okay, cool, that was a nice workout.
[58:44.77]And the next two or three days, it's like, oh my god, I can't even move.
[58:47.94]So it's actually kind of hard to do that.
[58:50.54]But I need to get, I'm doing some light stuff.
[58:53.40]Maybe like kind of doing an elliptical or jogging or something, just to drop a little bit of the weight.
[58:57.89]Come back down to like 155, 150.
[58:58.55]Maybe, I'll be happy at like 155.
[58:59.63]I will.
[59:09.39]You used to be so yoked.
[59:11.17]Yeah, I was.
[59:14.35]I was.
[59:14.61]I was an absolute stack of shit.
[59:17.67]Like, ten years ago.
[59:18.79]So I get to be that person now that's like, Hey, you know, ten years ago you should have seen me.
[59:24.85]I didn't know what that was going to be like to actually say that, but now here we are.
[59:32.64]That's a weird feeling.
[59:41.07]This is versus the Sonic guy.
[59:42.55]This is number three, right?
[59:47.89]The number three ranked assassin is Sonic Juice.
[59:50.85]Sonic Juice.
[59:52.49]Demon God.
[59:54.17]He is known as Fu's right hand.
[59:56.59]He is like the Guan Yu to Fu's Liu Bei.
[60:00.96]He is even called the Guan Yu of space.
[60:04.66]Let all your madness out, Travis.
[60:07.56]Welcome to the Garden of Insanity.
[60:11.83]As long as you're healthy?
[60:12.64]Yeah, that's the point.
[60:14.90]I never want to go too far or too... too low, right?
[60:19.86]I want to be somewhere in the middle.
[60:26.19]Like, look, I still... I still want to enjoy, you know, oh, I'm going to go eat out.
[60:31.45]Yeah, I'll take... I would love, like, a fucking nice, big, like, juicy cheeseburger.
[60:37.03]Or also, like, you know, I would enjoy... I'll take, like, a grilled chicken salad with some, you know, fresh greens and stuff.
[60:44.96]I don't want to have anything off-limits to myself, right?
[60:55.13]Okay, I only have... Okay, I got the heals.
[60:56.79]Remember, you're going to look like a boxing glove soon.
[61:00.71]I'm trying to picture what you're trying to say, and I'm having trouble.
[61:06.94]Because what does that mean?
[61:10.73]Like top heavy and like big, like big up top and small.
[61:15.13]A boxing glove is just big all around.
[61:23.44]Big?
[61:29.76]Remember, you have really long teeth.
[61:31.12]Can I have one of them?
[61:37.00]The day that I, like, sell a tooth to a viewer is the day where I have truly... It's truly over.
[61:43.88]It's just over.
[61:45.32]And it's time to pack up, shop, and close the door.
[61:51.68]Alright, let's do it.
[62:05.42]Oh, it's this guy!
[62:08.36]Oh, he's inside of that thing.
[62:10.38]I didn't even know he was in there.
[62:11.53]This is taking way too long.
[62:18.93]How long is this guy gonna walk?
[62:20.71]Just be patient.
[62:23.02]This is actually starting to freak me out a little.
[62:54.29]Is he smoking?
[62:56.67]These are bong rips.
[62:57.80]Who's doing that?
[63:00.96]Oh, it's the cat purring.
[63:05.24]Oh, the slowed down music.
[63:06.68]This is like a high scene.
[63:09.28]Gene, it's time.
[63:22.69]Sorry for the wait.
[63:25.71]I'm fine.
[63:26.81]But the younger gamers don't like waiting for shit.
[63:29.73]And that five minutes probably caused a lot of them to scrap this game.
[63:34.03]Yeah, good point.
[63:35.81]Hey, young gamers.
[63:37.92]I'm terribly sorry to make you wait.
[63:42.58]You don't have to go that far.
[63:45.62]And you've probably gotten cold standing out here.
[63:49.85]Don't worry about it.
[63:51.19]I've hated the sea since I was a kid, that's all.
[63:58.60]So even Earth has some good soldiers, too.
[64:01.65]I'm no fucking soldier.
[64:03.53]I'm a goddamn killer.
[64:05.45]Anyone getting in my way gets killed.
[64:07.95]I'm a passing assassin.
[64:09.79]I like this area.
[64:10.77]You don't look like a bad soldier.
[64:13.94]Either way, if you're going to take us down, you must be pretty tough.
[64:19.60]Fuckhead.
[64:20.70]This ain't the pub.
[64:21.98]I didn't come here to shoot the shit with coworkers and have a few beers after work and go home.
[64:27.32]We're gonna fight to the death.
[64:29.68]Then let me ask you this.
[64:31.86]Why do you want to kill me?
[64:34.98]If you're gonna fuck up my town, I don't give a shit who you are.
[64:39.26]You're my enemy, so I gotta kill you.
[64:42.16]That's all.
[64:43.70]I'll be honest with you.
[64:45.30]I don't agree with Fu.
[64:47.32]But because this planet is evil, it must be conquered and ruled over.
[64:52.73]But for some reason, I am unable to find the roots of evil in your people.
[64:58.80]So join me.
[65:00.18]I wonder why.
[65:02.28]I believe you may be a good species after all.
[65:04.76]And together we can destroy the sea.
[65:07.60]I'll never join you.
[65:11.21]Even if that were indeed the case, I cannot deny that I am unable to ascertain the point of fighting you.
[65:18.65]What's he got to say about it?
[65:21.15]Whom do you mean by he?
[65:25.64]I got no idea how this works.
[65:29.73]It is an avatar.
[65:31.49]A physical and a robot.
[65:33.79]Wait, is it an avatar?
[65:34.69]Wait, he kind of looks like avatar.
[65:36.55]Okay.
[65:37.83]I think I get it.
[65:38.55]Is this an avatar joke?
[65:39.55]I also kind of don't.
[65:41.93]Now then, let us negotiate this.
[65:45.79]No need for any of that.
[65:46.87]Captions are wrong.
[65:47.85]You just get the fuck out of this town.
[65:50.43]You willing to back off?
[65:53.98]That is going to be rather difficult.
[65:57.80]Fu is terrifying.
[65:59.54]If I were to disobey him, my entire species would be wiped out.
[66:03.24]Airbender?
[66:03.80]No.
[66:05.30]Like Avatar.
[66:06.04]James Cameron Avatar.
[66:07.50]A place as beautiful as this?
[66:10.38]This world was purged.
[66:12.40]Its civilizations decimated.
[66:15.09]Left with nothing but a legacy of death.
[66:18.75]I guess that settles it then.
[66:20.43]We're destined to fight.
[66:22.76]In that case, let's do it this way.
[66:25.50]I am no good with action type stuff, so let's do this RPG style.
[66:30.71]Oh, God.
[66:31.25]Why not fight in the genre of our liking, right?
[66:35.75]Speak for yourself, buddy.
[66:37.61]I'm all action or GTFO.
[66:42.33]Well, now you're trying to push your own preferences on me.
[66:46.69]Allow me to demonstrate my power.
[66:50.33]Encounter!
[66:53.56]Ah yes, that's nice.
[66:55.50]This is how we fight.
[66:57.87]Hey, what the hell?
[66:59.57]I can't move.
[67:00.27]What the hell is going on?
[67:02.61]Oh, come on.
[67:03.53]You're a gamer, aren't you?
[67:05.17]I shouldn't need to explain this to you.
[67:08.45]My beam katana won't fucking move.
[67:11.50]It's gonna be a turn-based fight.
[67:14.36]Legendary water!
[67:17.84]Shit!
[67:18.66]We gotta attack with command input?
[67:21.05]Do we really?
[67:21.73]We take turns attacking.
[67:23.55]It's an extremely fair way to do battle.
[67:27.66]I don't like this.
[67:28.96]So this is RPG style, huh?
[67:32.24]Maybe break my damn controller, so... What?
[67:36.66]So you don't know... What?
[67:39.36]You're certainly behind the times.
[67:42.51]Nope.
[67:43.27]Even if they... I'm not going anywhere near it.
[67:46.78]What are they bleeping?
[67:48.14]Why not?
[67:49.33]What reason could you have to be so stubborn about it?
[67:52.17]It's supposed to be Final Fantasy?
[67:53.15]Because the characters look fucking... Are they bleeping Final Fantasy?
[67:57.57]The characters look... But do the characters look... The characters look... You know, you're right.
[68:11.72]They look so...
[68:13.59]So what?
[68:13.99]Is it saying shitty?
[68:42.57]And at the same time, the characters do look f***ing shit.
[68:47.28]Nobody's at fault here.
[68:48.68]Not even f***ing designs are at fault.
[68:50.64]Wow.
[68:51.80]I feel like this is like a shot take here.
[68:53.76]You are really something, Travis.
[68:56.02]Looks like you really are a crazed psycho killer after all.
[68:59.81]This is really Suda51's Willy Wonka Castle.
[69:02.43]Like, this is just everything.
[69:03.67]I'll follow your lead.
[69:05.09]Off to the world of RPGs.
[69:13.40]Okay.
[69:14.10]So, here we go.
[69:21.11]Are you serious?
[69:22.39]Okay.
[69:24.99]Fight.
[69:27.52]Fight.
[69:32.32]Two damage.
[69:33.08]That's it?
[69:36.78]Building power up.
[69:39.07]This one looks tough.
[69:41.00]Okay, what about item?
[69:44.10]Herb times 10.
[69:46.50]Run.
[69:47.26]Can I just run?
[69:47.92]You can't run away.
[69:49.30]I wasted a turn.
[69:53.87]Oh, shit.
[69:56.85]65 damage.
[69:58.53]Alright, hold on.
[69:59.27]Magic.
[70:00.35]Fire, blizzard, thunder.
[70:01.70]I'm gonna try fire.
[70:03.66]Fire.
[70:04.48]Not enough MP?
[70:05.58]What?
[70:06.42]Sonic Juice Special Attack!
[70:09.16]Legendary Water!
[70:10.70]Why do I not have enough MP?
[70:15.39]Alright, that hurt a lot.
[70:20.75]Is it battery?
[70:22.63]Summon.
[70:24.75]No, not yet.
[70:25.35]Charge.
[70:27.11]Oh, okay.
[70:27.67]Do I have to have full charge do anything?
[70:30.57]Building up power.
[70:33.23]Okay, magic.
[70:35.84]Fire.
[70:38.62]What do you mean not enough MP?
[70:40.30]What are you talking about?
[70:41.32]Where's my MP?
[70:42.46]Okay, how about summon?
[70:51.38]I'm just going to summon somebody.
[70:53.84]Summon Bahamut.
[70:55.14]Bahamut is off on vacation.
[70:58.08]Sonic Juice Special Attack!
[71:00.84]Legendary Water!
[71:03.79]Okay, I think I just have to hit him.
[71:05.21]Fight, summon, charge.
[71:10.42]Okay, fight.
[71:15.36]System window?
[71:16.46]Wait, I can attack?
[71:18.02]Wait, what?
[71:20.28]What the fuck is this?
[71:24.13]I don't...
[71:31.35]Are you serious?
[71:32.23]Okay, that's funny.
[71:34.47]But wait, I don't want to do that first.
[71:35.93]Because then I won't be able to see what I'm doing.
[71:39.17]150 damage.
[71:42.06]I have herb that can heal.
[71:46.78]Alright, item, item, item.
[71:52.52]Take an herb.
[71:53.17]1000 HP restored.
[71:55.97]Okay, cool.
[71:56.49]Sonic juice special attack!
[71:59.25]Legendary water!
[72:04.36]I'm gonna attack the thing on the left first, because that's info I don't really care about.
[72:07.89]160.
[72:13.21]Summon again?
[72:23.32]Summon Knights of the Round Table.
[72:24.72]The Round Table meeting has gone into overtime.
[72:34.91]Alright, fight.
[72:39.01]I want to kill this thing.
[72:41.12]Alright, that thing's dead.
[72:43.40]But I want to be able to still fight.
[72:46.52]So if I get rid of that, will I... Wait a minute.
[72:51.65]If I get rid of this... Oh, shit.
[72:59.53]If I kill this, will I be able to move?
[73:08.22]I wonder if I just kill this, I can move around.
[73:17.25]Try a different magic.
[73:18.17]I don't have MP.
[73:19.15]Blizzard.
[73:24.11]I don't have MP.
[73:30.78]Try thunder for a clean machine.
[73:32.32]I'm, oh yeah, I just, I got, let's try thunder.
[73:37.44]I can do thunder.
[73:38.08]Your beam cannon is overflowing with power.
[73:40.58]Holy shit.
[73:42.84]Alright, hold on.
[73:44.14]Can I attack him?
[73:44.82]I'm gonna kill the system window.
[73:50.60]Attack doesn't reach.
[73:51.82]Fuck!
[73:52.66]Wait, what?
[73:54.15]Can I do thunder again?
[74:00.67]What should I hit with this?
[74:02.17]Him?
[74:08.50]Oh, that's a critical hit.
[74:09.44]That does damage.
[74:10.86]That's 700 damage.
[74:15.28]Okay.
[74:17.67]I don't think I want to kill the thing on the bottom.
[74:27.55]If I kill the command window, can I even attack him?
[74:29.49]I'm going to try.
[74:31.13]We'll see what happens.
[74:31.65]Whatever.
[74:36.25]I wonder if it lets me move around.
[74:37.76]Okay.
[74:38.20]Yeah, I'll heal.
[74:38.84]I don't even know how much health I have.
[74:52.71]Let's see.
[74:53.37]Probably like 1400?
[75:11.87]Alright, what happens if I do this?
[75:14.64]Gone.
[75:19.37]That's enough of this JRPG bullshit.
[75:21.85]Okay, here on out.
[75:23.85]We're having a good old boss fight now.
[75:26.23]I can move around Yeah
[75:50.25]Let's go.
[75:51.70]We're going to push it to the limit.
[75:54.74]Limit.
[75:55.32]So this is the power of light.
[76:00.59]Let's go.
[76:17.44]I hope this song is an absolute banger, you know what I mean?
[76:25.19]Oh, that hurt.
[76:28.05]Where is it?
[76:32.57]Fuck, alright, I gotta time that better.
[76:33.81]Fuck!
[76:41.60]Dodge better!
[76:42.22]There we go.
[76:47.54]Ooh, that hurts.
[76:49.34]Can I kick him from here?
[76:59.59]Nope.
[77:00.45]Okay, that was a bad idea.
[77:03.47]Alright, that hits him.
[77:15.34]One Punch Man!
[77:20.98]There it is.
[77:25.93]There's the dodge.
[77:28.11]Can I get him here?
[77:29.95]I can reach him from here.
[77:31.55]When he leans in, I can get him like that.
[77:32.65]Alright, good.
[77:33.03]Let's go.
[77:40.26]Can I hit him with anything else?
[77:41.24]I don't think so.
[77:48.44]He's gone.
[77:48.82]Almost dead.
[77:53.97]There it is again.
[77:54.77]Go.
[77:59.60]Mustang mode.
[78:00.30]Oh, my God.
[78:00.90]It's unfair.
[78:01.90]It's so unfair to get this in a boss.
[78:09.20]This is so unfair.
[78:11.13]That's a whole phase gone.
[78:13.95]Oh, my goodness.
[78:14.47]What did I do?
[78:23.97]Whoa, it takes up the whole screen.
[78:25.21]Get up!
[78:34.88]I don't even know what movie's doing.
[78:35.92]Oh my god.
[78:38.56]Okay, don't die.
[78:39.14]I just got a free phase gone.
[78:40.87]Left side.
[78:54.68]Stay all the way up jump.
[79:00.21]What?
[79:00.45]Oh, you gotta go in the middle.
[79:01.33]I get it.
[79:01.59]Okay Alright, let's get in there
[79:24.64]Alright, two, and then in the middle.
[79:26.30]Alright, I got it.
[79:29.08]Sonic juice!
[79:30.28]Special attack!
[79:35.96]Damn it, I missed.
[79:40.40]I'm in good shape though, I'm fine.
[79:41.31]That wasn't a perfect dodge, how?
[79:44.21]Eat this!
[79:49.35]There is an MMO fight.
[79:50.87]Legendary water!
[79:56.29]Alright, I gotta get perfect dodge, come on.
[80:08.76]Oh fuck, I was trying to dodge through it.
[80:10.14]Alright, he's slow.
[80:20.29]No!
[80:21.31]Get in there quick!
[80:30.13]Alright, don't fuck this one up.
[80:31.97]That one's easy to avoid.
[80:36.45]Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
[80:44.67]Oh.
[80:45.26]Alright.
[80:47.40]Eat this.
[80:50.14]Ooh, in the middle.
[80:54.44]He's almost dead.
[81:02.73]Get in the clothes, come on!
[81:09.09]What is he saying?
[81:09.89]Comi testo?
[81:10.99]Is it?
[81:13.23]He's done.
[81:17.20]That was a cool fight.
[81:31.50]I like that one a lot, actually.
[81:32.82]That was really cool.
[81:39.60]Fuck off!
[81:40.50]Wait.
[81:41.68]What?
[81:42.92]I submit.
[81:44.56]I give up.
[81:46.24]I cannot fight pointlessly any longer.
[81:48.78]Begging for quarter, huh?
[81:50.70]So even aliens have that sort of thing.
[81:53.66]There are people waiting for me on my planet.
[81:56.79]I cannot die yet.
[82:02.69]Fine, you're an interesting guy.
[82:10.69]You fucking dick prince!
[82:14.41]You're getting soft, assassin.
[82:16.83]You can't beat me like that.
[82:18.85]You're too soft.
[82:24.93]Wasn't that your friend?
[82:27.31]I've forgotten about all that old stuff.
[82:29.83]We're in different positions now.
[82:32.68]whatever let's settle this here yeah who's two looks like we've got the stage all set bring it prince foo as this goes against ranking battle rules you will be stripped of the number one position do you still want to fight what the fuck is going on with her hold on to this bloodlust till the actual fight
[83:03.58]You just wait.
[83:04.74]She keeps being upgraded every time we see her.
[83:07.02]Congratulations.
[83:08.71]You have been recognized as number two in the galactic rankings.
[83:13.27]Next up is the final battle against Prince Fu.
[83:17.41]All of a sudden, I'm number two?
[83:19.72]What happened to two?
[83:20.30]Number two was Paradox Bandit, but Prince Fu killed him.
[83:24.70]Deep down inside, it looks like he's sick of this conquest game.
[83:30.16]Travis, it means he's recognized you as a threat.
[83:34.35]He is scared of you.
[83:35.99]Oh, yeah.
[83:36.99]I could feel it.
[83:37.67]Those eyes.
[83:38.25]This falls out bloodlust.
[83:40.77]I've never seen anything like it.
[83:42.99]He is waiting for you at Daemon Tower.
[83:49.85]What's that ship?
[83:51.51]I borrowed it.
[83:53.39]A certain benevolent third party said I could use it.
[83:56.51]Here's the copyright-related stuff.
[83:58.47]Thanks a lot, Yura-san.
[83:59.87]With that kind of technology, I could have come to this planet without full armor.
[84:06.98]Oh, eyes are gone.
[84:40.78]Give me an S. C. That's too bad.
[84:52.03]Alright, so the thing about this game that we're realizing, spoilers by the way if you don't know what we're doing.
[84:58.40]This whole list was just here for a joke.
[85:03.02]None of this even mattered.
[85:03.86]And that's kind of funny to me.
[85:04.90]Like, oh, the top 10 cosmic assassins.
[85:08.82]It didn't even matter.
[85:10.56]That's not even who we fought.
[85:11.98]More than like two thirds of the time.
[85:13.84]That's hilarious.
[85:20.93]You fight only like half of them, yeah.
[85:29.31]So I'm really just kind of wondering what the last arc of this game is going to be then.
[85:35.14]If this game's entire storyline here so far has been Suda51 just doesn't give a shit and he's going to do whatever he wants.
[85:43.32]What happens at the end?
[85:44.04]I have no idea what they're going to do.
[85:46.20]I have no idea what happens.
[85:48.46]I'm more interested in what the last boss fight is even going to be than anything that we've done so far.
[86:01.10]Like the story of what happens at the end is more important to me than the entire game.
[86:22.04]There's probably gonna be like three or four people that kill each other in a row.
[86:26.31]We're gonna get the dollhouse lawyer joke except in the actual game.
[86:47.68]it's gonna be a pog ending um oh I'm sorry I bumped you very curious everyone's just a lawyer we're gonna get overstimulated again oh sh don't talk through the intro
[87:34.22]The chair is the same.
[87:44.11]You know what makes Miike perfect?
[87:47.11]He's even good at period pieces.
[87:49.19]Here it is.
[87:50.33]The big three period pieces.
[87:52.57]The best one has got to be 13 Assassins, right?
[87:56.02]After that, it's Ninja Kids.
[87:57.98]Harakiri, Death of a Samurai is a masterpiece, too.
[88:01.92]The casting is amazing.
[88:03.90]Who's this cool-ass Japanese dude?
[88:06.83]Yeah, Takayuki is great.
[88:08.99]That sort of instability is awesome.
[88:11.57]Takayuki isn't acting.
[88:13.77]He's swimming in the sea of imagery.
[88:17.34]Kubota's gonna go places, too.
[88:20.11]Kuvota from Kitai Investigator 7?
[88:23.81]That's one good looking dude.
[88:25.20]Is that the medic?
[88:26.46]Nobuaki from Crow Zero 2 freaked me out.
[88:29.22]He's awesome.
[88:30.66]But Nobuaki is hella sweet.
[88:34.07]Not enough can be said about Miyake's delinquent movies.
[88:37.71]He totally gets the fine line between delinquent and Yakuza.
[88:42.14]The Yakuza and his delinquent movies are stand-ins for the world of grown-ups.
[88:47.06]He really burns depth and fear into his imagery.
[88:50.90]Fuck, Miyake is so awesome.
[88:54.48]For reals.
[88:56.72]I felt a bad chill.
[89:00.06]I haven't even started over your dead body yet.
[89:03.84]I'm going to go outside real quick.
[89:09.07]I will just go on record here.
[89:10.85]I think that of any voice actor I've ever heard, I think Robin Atkin Downs is the absolute best.
[89:19.96]He's got the best exclamation sound.
[89:25.30]No one comes close in the entire industry.
[89:29.91]I'm not going to be able to do it, but that like, literally nobody can do it but him.
[89:37.29]He's got the best exclamations in the entire industry.
[89:46.94]You know the one I'm talking about too.
[89:50.36]His yelling and his exclamatory way of talking is just unbeatable.
[90:08.00]He's the best in the English VA scene.
[90:11.71]Yeah, I would say he's probably up there in the top five.
[90:14.41]At least.
[90:15.67]Top ten.
[90:19.77]Without a doubt.
[90:22.23]Alright, let's change the clothes here.
[90:27.19]I feel like this is going to be one of the last... This is going to be one of the last t-shirts.
[90:36.01]Let's make it count.
[90:44.73]I kind of like this one.
[90:51.06]That's the new one.
[90:51.64]Are we going to need anything else besides that?
[91:14.06]Hmm.
[91:16.08]Put on the fuck racism one?
[91:17.52]Yeah.
[91:18.88]Yeah.
[91:19.57]Yeah, I think so.
[91:21.27]Yeah, this is the one.
[91:27.13]Yeah, I think we end the game with this.
[91:44.45]I want some more color.
[91:46.47]I want, like, reds, teals, blues, robin's egg blue, bright green.
[91:53.92]All the t-shirts are, like, just white with black.
[91:57.16]It's just a white t-shirt with, like, a black print.
[92:02.14]I want more than just white t-shirts.
[92:03.50]I have to find them, probably, right?
[92:07.91]The ones that you just get for doing the game.
[92:10.13]All the t-shirt aliens, I need to find them.
[92:18.66]I want, like, a bright orange shirt.
[92:21.80]Or, like, bright yellow or something.
[92:25.94]The boss t-shirts are all white with black logos.
[92:28.20]Ah, that makes sense, yeah.
[92:36.33]Whoa, this is different.
[92:38.85]You got a mail from someone mysterious.
[92:41.95]Okay, what is it?
[92:46.66]Order of the Emerald Knight.
[92:47.90]Wait in the motel parking lot.
[92:50.34]My cross sword craves your blood.
[92:52.53]Once you're ready, come out to the motel parking lot.
[92:57.75]Uh... Okay.
[93:02.67]Let's check on bad girl.
[93:28.48]Hey old man, I got a bad feeling.
[93:29.72]What is it?
[93:29.98]You gonna tell me my fortune or something?
[93:31.71]If you were getters, then I'd believe you.
[93:33.95]But anything else is just bullshitting.
[93:35.31]I got no idea what that means, but this town is filled with evil.
[93:39.80]You better watch your back.
[93:42.22]Whatever may come will protect this town.
[93:43.54]You don't have to worry.
[93:52.79]I just walked around that room like it was Resident Evil 2.
[93:59.91]Seven viewer Andy.
[94:02.15]That's because I don't stream long enough.
[94:04.79]Do you understand?
[94:05.37]I turn my broadcast on and turn it off in 30 seconds.
[94:08.40]You're not going to get engagement that way, Travis.
[94:13.72]Do I want to do this right now?
[94:14.54]I guess.
[94:17.06]Yeah, let's do it.
[94:30.29]You should do a one minute stream.
[94:32.43]I've thought about doing that joke before where I turn the stream on and it turns off in five minutes.
[94:35.79]But, I mean, people's notifications don't even come in.
[94:39.25]It's just awful.
[94:40.63]It just fucks up everybody's timeline.
[94:41.99]Who the fuck is this?
[94:58.64]Thanks for watching!
[95:07.21]But even so.
[95:08.69]You know, having a brother like you?
[95:11.38]It's fucking embarrassing, you retweaked asshole.
[95:16.12]How many times must I say this?
[95:18.72]I saw a movie about God, and it just flowed through me like electricity.
[95:24.01]I realized the anguish of having such a good-for-nothing little brother, and came to the conclusion that I have to stop you.
[95:30.83]Yeah, no thanks.
[95:32.53]Quit getting in my way with your personal bullshit.
[95:36.12]Hey, do you remember?
[95:38.14]Nope.
[95:42.18]Listen, little brother.
[95:43.63]It was a snowy day.
[95:45.51]We three siblings made our escape from our serial killer father.
[95:49.32]In TSA, he watched the movie Thor and joined a cult because of it.
[95:54.74]And you were crying as you ran.
[95:57.60]We spent days and days in the woods.
[96:00.36]We built an igloo out of the snow to escape the cold.
[96:04.35]We had finally found our way to a major road.
[96:07.73]Those huge cars moved in and surrounded us.
[96:11.26]We heard the sound of the locks.
[96:14.32]The adults.
[96:15.34]They took us.
[96:16.32]And they tied us up.
[96:17.84]After that, I lost all my memories.
[96:21.26]And had them overwritten with those of a child born to the Cooldown family.
[96:28.22]So fucking what?
[96:29.88]This is something you gotta bring up right here, right now?
[96:32.66]Right here, right now is exactly why I bring this up, little brother.
[96:37.42]You were always crying.
[96:39.18]Keep on crying as you live, as you always have.
[96:42.68]Now, keep on crying as you die.
[96:46.96]You really turned out fucked up, you know that?
[96:49.63]The fuck is all this dark side bullshit?
[96:52.19]Before worrying about me, first kill that asswipe.
[96:56.27]Fool.
[96:58.10]Okay, well again motel parking lot.
[97:03.40]Ow.
[97:26.13]Fuck him up!
[97:26.65]You can't even get out of my 30-hit combo, buddy.
[98:02.68]Why am I on fire?
[98:03.34]Alright, phase two.
[98:06.40]We're gonna go into space?
[98:10.98]I hope not.
[98:11.38]Whoa!
[98:11.74]Okay, that was bad.
[98:30.21]Awww.
[98:30.47]Stun.
[98:31.07]Alright.
[98:32.57]Oh.
[98:32.89]Crap.
[98:33.55]Nice bit rate.
[98:35.63]I can imagine how bad it looks.
[99:18.76]Mustang mode, it's over.
[99:20.10]This is cheating at this point.
[99:27.03]Okay, that was annoying.
[99:29.31]I couldn't touch him.
[99:35.01]Shit, okay.
[99:35.41]I don't have any heals left.
[99:36.67]Fuck!
[99:36.89]Alright, just play well.
[99:39.45]You'll be fine.
[99:40.69]There it is.
[99:42.07]This is the end for him.
[100:19.04]I wonder how much more difficult this is on hard.
[100:23.52]I wonder if it's gonna be one of those cases where it's like way too hard on hard and way too easy on normal.
[100:30.19]I wonder.
[100:41.89]Henry, cooldown, dead.
[100:44.77]You just killed your brother.
[100:50.07]This fight was brutal on Carolina Reaper.
[100:52.59]Because it's two more difficulties after you beat the game, right?
[100:55.28]This isn't over yet!
[101:04.64]Don't cry, Travis!
[101:07.96]Don't cry!
[101:12.61]This is horrifying.
[101:23.25]Oh, Smash Brothers!
[101:27.97]That's not what I was talking about, by the way.
[101:29.97]And that's what people thought I was.
[101:47.75]Okay, well, so that counts as two.
[101:49.39]Congratulations, Travis.
[101:51.05]This has nothing to do with the rankings, but how does Fratricide feel?
[101:56.43]Refreshing.
[101:58.07]That is great.
[101:59.37]Yeah.
[102:00.79]Just one left.
[102:03.23]Prince Fool is waiting.
[102:05.03]What the hell is going on?
[102:08.17]She lives here?
[102:08.81]Sylvia, once all this fighting is over, will you listen to me?
[102:12.13]I need to talk to you.
[102:14.70]They're married.
[102:15.34]So now I have to go to Fu Tower.
[102:17.16]Oh, no.
[102:17.28]Okay.
[102:21.76]What?
[102:44.73]Are they clones?
[102:52.99]Okay.
[102:53.98]Wait, that was the whole episode?
[102:57.00]Man, the runtime on that one.
[103:04.10]That's quite a short episode.
[103:07.51]That's not the standard 22 minute runtime.
[103:10.55]It's the non-standard 4 minute runtime.
[103:15.25]That was half of an Aqua Teen episode.
[103:29.48]It was filler.
[103:32.86]Non-canon filler.
[103:34.27]That's so funny.
[103:35.09]I hope that's accurate.
[103:53.96]Somebody just said, uh-oh, budget's running low.
[103:56.60]Be careful.
[104:00.28]You know, if I were a game company or a media company, I would make the last two episodes first.
[104:06.55]Wouldn't you?
[104:06.83]Huh.
[104:14.69]They do that sometimes.
[104:15.65]Yeah, like make sure you get the whole last two or three episodes done with a ton of the money.
[104:22.98]And then you cut, you know, then cut corners when they're like having tea in the laundry room, right?
[104:28.78]We don't need the budget for that one.
[104:31.34]I'm sure they do.
[104:32.16]I hope they do.
[104:39.23]Most writers start at the ending.
[104:41.67]Yeah, but does production start at the ending?
[104:43.82]Not a lot of times, but maybe not.
[104:44.74]What?
[104:44.86]What?
[104:45.12]Am I stuck in the bathroom?
[104:59.35]Huh?
[105:00.13]Iwasaki?
[105:02.35]You're not there either?
[105:03.95]You gotta keep the save-related stuff in working shape, man!
[105:08.11]Who the hell debugged this shit?
[105:10.27]Don't tell me it was .
[105:12.09]Their checks are way too lax.
[105:14.05]Should've gone with .
[105:18.79]Wait.
[105:19.84]This is no bug.
[105:24.01]You assholes.
[105:25.29]Are you Henry's buddies?
[105:27.11]You dirty fucking cosplayers.
[105:30.51]Boy, I can't fight in the bathroom?
[105:34.08]What?
[105:36.68]You screwed up.
[105:38.75]We just killed him.
[105:39.67]What?
[106:18.76]Age 99.
[106:19.64]Three lives left.
[106:21.10]Okay.
[106:24.53]This is Deathman.
[106:25.27]This is the beginning of the game.
[106:31.05]He was talking about this game that he played.
[106:32.59]This game I played.
[106:34.37]It's called Deathman.
[106:37.45]Oh, he died in one hit.
[106:39.39]Alright, I gotta be aware of that.
[106:53.99]Good thing I had blinking so I couldn't get hurt.
[106:58.31]Oh my god, you die by the spikes.
[107:09.25]Okay, well that's good to know.
[107:14.08]I can't hurt that guy.
[107:21.20]Is this cube?
[107:24.90]I think I have to collect them or something.
[107:26.14]I thought that was a pizza.
[107:28.12]That's cool.
[107:28.50]Okay.
[107:39.63]Yeah, oh, it's death.
[107:40.59]Okay, the word's death.
[107:45.89]I love the SEGA Genesis sounds, though.
[107:53.18]Death.
[107:55.80]What's that doing?
[108:01.29]Death.
[108:06.09]What the hell is going on?
[108:08.81]Oh jeez, alright.
[108:11.55]I need that sword.
[108:17.35]Alright, kill.
[108:20.99]Well, alright.
[108:22.23]I like this game.
[108:22.99]This game's fun.
[108:24.55]Alright, hit him a couple times.
[108:40.28]What the fuck hit me?
[108:41.10]Drop it.
[108:51.48]Give me the sword!
[108:52.34]Dark Souls 2 hitboxes.
[109:14.37]No!
[109:14.69]Don't get hurt.
[109:15.11]There's too many enemies on the screen.
[109:17.33]I gotta clear.
[109:25.81]Oh, how much health does he have?
[109:35.13]Oh, fuck you.
[109:40.15]Give it to me.
[109:41.29]Shit.
[109:56.19]Got him, alright.
[109:56.75]I think I have- this is just a- it's scripted.
[110:00.13]You're supposed to get hurt.
[110:08.76]Uh.
[110:12.72]Okay.
[110:20.00]Who are you?
[110:20.44]Just a passing assassin.
[110:23.72]Well, a dead assassin now.
[110:26.32]Welcome to the world of Death Man.
[110:28.58]Let us raise a glass to death.
[110:31.97]So this is the land of death, huh?
[110:34.21]I'm not even going to try.
[110:35.57]He's unmatched.
[110:37.59]Looks like something from an 80s arcade game.
[110:41.37]What hardware does this run on?
[110:43.19]A death drive?
[110:44.21]No, I can't.
[110:44.86]They're not even worth it.
[110:45.74]You can't imitate, like, literal gold.
[110:50.08]It's impossible.
[110:52.53]Here, take this.
[110:54.75]What's this?
[110:56.05]Blood wine.
[110:56.67]100 year old death emperor wine.
[110:59.09]Enjoy.
[111:03.47]You got any beer?
[111:04.32]I don't have kids drinks here.
[111:08.64]Okay, fine then.
[111:10.52]Cheers.
[111:15.47]Congratulations, Travis.
[111:17.29]You're an uninvited guest here.
[111:18.99]Return to the piss-smelling world from whence you came.
[111:24.96]Right on.
[111:26.56]Send me back.
[111:37.06]Why does he keep having his head cut off?
[111:42.89]If you die in the game, you come back to life.
[111:46.26]That's not the joke.
[111:59.74]Hey!
[112:01.06]Anybody there?
[112:02.28]Hey!
[112:03.12]I'm still alive down here!
[112:04.89]Somebody give me a hand, huh?
[112:07.05]Hello?
[112:09.11]Anybody there?
[112:10.19]I'm buried?
[112:11.13]Gravekeeper!
[112:14.49]Hey!
[112:15.49]Hey!
[112:20.81]Somebody!
[112:22.20]Seriously, I'm gonna die!
[112:23.68]Let me out!
[112:24.74]Help me!
[112:30.76]Wait, not even buried, just sitting in a cement casket?
[112:33.78]Yeah, thanks a lot.
[112:35.04]Wait.
[112:35.62]Seriously?
[112:37.52]I was buried, okay.
[112:39.28]What a peach, huh?
[112:41.18]Getting buried alive like that.
[112:45.65]No way.
[112:46.33]For reals?
[112:47.79]You're... My name is Miike.
[112:51.20]You're a friend of his, right?
[112:53.70]Mr. Miike.
[112:55.30]Miike.
[112:55.70]You're really Takashi Miike.
[112:59.02]Are you shooting something here?
[113:00.18]Are you finally making your Hollywood debut?
[113:04.22]Andromedia 2.
[113:06.19]No, that's not it.
[113:07.31]Ichi the Killer 2.
[113:08.77]Oh shit, I hella want to see that.
[113:10.35]Real person, Omega Lo.
[113:12.31]Apocalypse 2.
[113:13.71]Or something totally new.
[113:17.01]No.
[113:17.97]In Japan, it's called Nanakaiki.
[113:21.16]In Buddhism, the number 7 is very important.
[113:25.42]So, we visit our friend's graves after a full 6 years have passed.
[113:31.68]And so, as I was walking by, I heard your voice.
[113:37.77]Mr. Miike, I know you just totally saved my life, but I've got a request.
[113:43.53]Do you mind?
[113:44.99]What is it?
[113:46.37]I'd be happy to do whatever I can.
[113:48.75]Could you film a live action version of No More Heroes?
[113:52.76]They're not going to do that, are they?
[113:58.16]No, they're not.
[114:01.16]did they do that did they actually do it did they do at least they please tell me they did that do it do it do it this is a bit everyone's here this game goes up a full letter grade if they do it master you're alive chernobyl our defensive battle was a success the champ's here too welcome back grandpa you're here too
[114:28.48]Do a live action bit, please.
[114:29.44]Oh.
[114:29.50]I don't know if they're gonna do it.
[114:30.78]I hope they do.
[114:31.32]Please.
[115:03.63]It's about time for the climax.
[115:08.61]Oh, they don't.
[115:10.05]That's too bad.
[115:10.95]Can you imagine if all of a sudden we saw a trailer for No More Heroes?
[115:16.22]That's alright.
[115:21.02]That's alright.
[115:21.70]That's alright.
[115:26.12]Wait, don't write it off yet.
[115:27.04]We're not going to share it.
[115:30.30]What was the point in killing him?
[115:31.36]Yeah, I don't... What was that?
[115:32.98]What just even happened?
[115:44.35]How bleak.
[115:46.07]It wasn't that long ago, but it somehow feels nostalgic.
[115:49.78]It feels like it was years ago.
[115:52.95]Give it up for Travis.
[115:54.99]Humans aren't all bullshit after all.
[115:57.53]He's no representative of humanity.
[116:00.11]He's just a street punk.
[116:02.23]Why do you hate him so much?
[116:05.63]I hate punks.
[116:07.69]They're violent, evil psychos.
[116:10.28]Kinda like you, Fu.
[116:12.38]This is my fight.
[116:14.02]But it's Travis' fight as well.
[116:16.30]As fighters, we understand each other.
[116:19.18]Somewhat.
[116:21.28]But you, you don't fight.
[116:24.94]That's right.
[116:25.88]I have nothing to do with this.
[116:27.74]I was simply dragged into it all.
[116:31.38]You really believe that?
[116:34.08]Think about it.
[116:35.56]Why would Travis come here?
[116:37.89]Was it a coincidence?
[116:39.87]He's... because he's an assassin.
[116:43.21]No.
[116:44.91]You brought Travis here.
[116:47.19]You wanted me to do it.
[116:49.53]He wants Foo to die.
[117:17.77]This is like WWE.
[117:33.32]Yeah.
[117:33.54]Travis beats up Damon in TSA.
[117:44.16]Skipped TSA.
[117:45.32]Irma window.
[117:53.18]This game doesn't feel like it's about anything.
[117:58.51]Master, I'm sorry for the trouble.
[118:02.07]It's cool.
[118:02.93]Let's watch some movies.
[118:05.09]Today, we're doing a Miyake and Hideaki viewing party.
[118:09.83]So, how are your arms doing?
[118:12.77]Slowly but surely, I'm getting used to the sensation.
[118:16.60]I can't hold my sword just yet, though.
[118:19.34]No need to rush.
[118:20.78]I want to hurry up and help you out.
[118:23.86]What do you like, Shinobu?
[118:25.04]What do I like?
[118:28.33]I like my master.
[118:29.63]It kind of almost feels like Suda51 was told by his parents that you can dress yourself today.
[118:33.33]So you're a real straight shooter, I see.
[118:35.63]It's like what this whole game kind of feels like.
[118:37.21]What kind of movies do you like?
[118:38.77]Like little kids.
[118:39.44]Chi-style stuff.
[118:41.20]Chi-style?
[118:42.40]Gundam type?
[118:44.08]Terraformers!
[118:45.06]It's just insane.
[118:45.88]There's a bunch of combinations that don't make sense next to each other.
[118:49.78]Or did you see the movie first and then the original?
[118:52.58]Terra?
[118:54.16]I don't know what that means.
[118:55.94]You got your dad's, like, size 10 shoes on.
[118:58.78]Barbados sword play.
[118:59.72]You're wearing, like, a big, like, a big, like, styled, like, peacock hat.
[119:03.04]Are you trying to get some practice in?
[119:05.02]Yes.
[119:05.94]The broadsword action.
[119:07.10]Your mother's blouse is on.
[119:08.28]It's, like, going down to your knees.
[119:09.39]You're a real studious one, huh?
[119:10.75]You have four pairs of underwear on.
[119:12.07]One way is the way of the sword.
[119:14.57]Wow.
[119:15.47]What a line.
[119:16.75]For times like this, Ike and swords means blade of the immortal.
[119:23.13]Huh?
[119:25.73]I love the original.
[119:27.17]I'd like to watch that one.
[119:28.97]Please show me the film.
[119:38.84]It's just everything just so mushed up together.
[119:41.66]It's like no rhyme or reason to anything but somehow there is.
[119:49.00]You can play death man in your room.
[119:50.72]Oh cool.
[120:01.24]This is way too deep for you, bro.
[120:03.66]I'm afraid to save the game.
[120:04.70]Do I get a pee break?
[120:20.27]Uh, yeah, we'll do a pee break.
[120:21.83]It's been about two hours.
[120:23.07]Do I have any money?
[120:28.30]I have enough money to do this.
[120:30.70]I'm going to spend some of the money.
[120:33.47]And then we'll take a break.
[120:35.25]I'll be right back.
[120:35.69]I might get another coffee too.
[120:37.77]I'm in like a coffee mood right now.
[120:51.76]Nice.
[120:52.80]It's so funny because this game...
[120:54.66]There's probably been a few times where I could have told you I didn't like something in the game, but I can't tell you that.
[120:59.86]It's weird.
[121:02.68]It may have been a handful of opportunities where I really could have been like, yeah, this is like this.
[121:06.11]I don't like this part.
[121:08.19]But my vocal cords and my lips cannot tell you that.
[121:11.43]They can't speak it to you for some reason.
[121:14.33]I don't know why.
[121:22.92]I think...
[121:35.58]Let's just dump it into the cooldown.
[121:39.47]It's not in his programming.
[121:46.95]Okay, the real thing that I could tell you, which is just like, holy shit, this looks awful, is a lot of the graphics really do feel like they're from, like, the Wii.
[121:54.14]It just feels like a Wii game a lot of times.
[121:56.08]But, like, who cares?
[121:56.94]Like, I really don't care.
[121:58.48]It's not a problem to me.
[122:13.97]Okay, it would be a problem if the game slowed down a shitload.
[122:18.73]And if it ran at a terrible frame rate or something.
[122:22.42]And if it actually impeded the video game.
[122:24.52]I'd be like, wow, this sucks.
[122:27.30]But I really don't care.
[122:28.02]Alright, let's take a few break.
[122:34.06]I'll be right back.
[122:34.46]Give me like two or three minutes.
[122:36.22]I'm going to make another coffee.
[122:37.75]Be back in like a few minutes.
[122:39.15]See you soon.
[129:15.97]Hello, hi.
[129:18.97]Oh, I fucking fell in.
[129:20.79]What, did you fall in?
[129:23.22]What, did you fall in?
[129:23.94]Uh, hey, who's in the, hello, who's in the bathroom?
[129:27.82]I'm in here.
[129:28.24]Yeah, you've been in there for a while.
[129:29.98]What, did you fall in?
[129:32.18]Ha!
[129:34.16]What's this chant?
[129:42.93]Alright, let's get back to it.
[129:43.73]This is the final, probably last half an hour or so of this game, I would assume.
[129:50.52]Find out.
[129:52.88]I am ready to play.
[129:58.94]Oh, I just did that.
[129:59.78]Stop doing that.
[130:17.78]Make a convention about yourself and call it JermaCon.
[130:22.48]I got like fucking shit-faced one night and I talked about, I'm gonna rent out a whole section of one of the casinos here and we're gonna have a convention.
[130:30.80]I literally made that reference.
[130:32.22]That just didn't happen.
[130:35.93]Alright, congratulations on rank two.
[130:37.21]We're coming to inform you the entry conditions for the next battle.
[130:39.35]$60,000 is the final amount of money you need.
[130:53.43]So designated matches are... Where exactly?
[130:57.59]Anywhere?
[130:58.09]Just any of the ones that I've done already?
[131:01.54]Where is that, um... Where is Fu's castle?
[131:05.74]Wherever it is.
[131:08.66]Over here.
[131:09.02]There's two here.
[131:13.69]I think I can just do them anywhere then.
[131:17.83]Where am I?
[131:18.31]Alright, so there's a couple here.
[131:20.29]Well, let's do the one here.
[131:22.58]Two that I haven't done yet.
[131:23.34]Pre-recorded stream.
[131:28.02]Got me.
[131:35.10]What is this thing you guys are writing?
[131:37.09]Women want me.
[131:38.61]Fish want me.
[131:39.25]What is this?
[131:39.69]What's this a reference to?
[131:41.15]I don't get it.
[131:50.31]It's just because of unfunny spam?
[131:52.79]Huh.
[131:56.65]Okay.
[131:59.28]Um... Streamer just told you to do something.
[132:03.94]So I suggest you fucking do it.
[132:05.44]I said stop.
[132:08.26]Streamer literally just told you to do something, now fucking stop doing it.
[132:26.27]The mod started it?
[132:28.27]Really?
[132:31.53]MonkaW.
[132:34.37]MonkaW is not a chant, it's a face.
[132:37.71]I'm sorry.
[132:39.14]MonkaW is not like... It's everybody collectively in the stadium all going like...
[132:54.74]Oh, wait, if it was MonkaW, it'd be... Imagine if it was like, oh, look out, the stadium's doing MonkaW right now.
[133:05.93]There's a bunch of people.
[133:06.63]The whole stadium is just doing that.
[133:11.23]That's not a chant.
[133:12.83]It's an expression.
[133:14.27]The game is very loud now.
[133:24.82]Got sniped by your own teammate.
[133:30.12]You guys can't even work together.
[133:34.60]Verbally chanting MonkaW.
[133:45.43]Why would you chant MonkaW?
[133:48.49]MonkaW!
[133:49.53]MonkaW!
[133:50.57]MonkaW!
[133:51.59]MonkaW!
[133:52.29]It'd just be like, what the fuck are these people doing?
[133:59.98]Aw, suplex machine!
[134:03.24]Isn't that somebody's actual move in wrestling?
[134:16.72]Suplex city.
[134:18.22]This guy's almost dead and this guy's a huge pain in the ass.
[134:27.74]Alright, come on.
[134:28.20]Kill them both.
[134:28.84]Nice.
[134:37.39]How does that move?
[134:40.63]Awww.
[134:43.39]Nobody does Jerma Suplexes.
[134:48.35]Did they not do them anymore?
[134:49.73]Did they not do Jerma Suplexes in wrestling anymore?
[135:04.72]Brock Lesnar does them all the time.
[135:10.44]It's too dangerous.
[135:13.05]Come on, swing.
[135:13.75]Swing!
[135:16.83]Fuck!
[135:20.25]You're too slow.
[135:20.93]I don't like slow enemies.
[135:21.79]I have no health.
[135:26.41]I don't like slow enemies.
[135:27.32]They're hard to predict.
[135:33.23]I'm gonna fucking die.
[135:50.48]Stars!
[135:51.50]Yes!
[135:53.78]Invincible load activated!
[135:58.11]You can't hurt me!
[136:03.92]Yes!
[136:06.50]Funny because he showed up yesterday in SmackDown.
[136:08.35]I didn't see what the rating was.
[136:23.17]Was it good?
[136:23.51]I was looking at chat.
[136:25.11]Do you still watch wrestling?
[136:28.91]I do not.
[136:34.32]I used to like wrestling because wrestling to me was like a cartoon.
[136:39.62]It was superheroes fighting each other and just wild outrageous shit going on.
[136:44.08]It was never supposed to be real to me.
[136:46.66]It was always like almost theater in a way.
[136:50.38]In recent years, wrestling has tried to be a like taken as seriously as baseball.
[136:57.53]So it's like I don't care.
[137:06.35]And yeah, I have heard that, like, AEW is, dude, watch AEW, watch AEW.
[137:10.63]I know, but I think I'm probably just kind of over it, too.
[137:12.65]In a way.
[137:15.37]I gotta go that way?
[137:25.96]Which way am I going here?
[137:26.60]Yeah, over here.
[137:29.02]He's a jaded old man.
[137:41.49]WWE is still hitting record profits.
[137:44.01]I mean, I didn't say that you should not watch wrestling and it's not popular and everybody hates it.
[137:50.53]I just said the reason why I used to watch wrestling was not because of the fact that they were wrestling.
[137:55.75]It was like Ken Shamrock being locked in a cage and Incredible Hulk bending the bars like Superman.
[138:05.69]It was Mick Foley being three different people.
[138:09.35]Even though you knew he was just one guy.
[138:11.40]Oh, here comes Cactus Jack!
[138:13.52]Dude love!
[138:14.28]They were two different people, but it was literally just him being three or four different characters.
[138:28.87]It was like the promos.
[138:31.39]Wrestling promos.
[138:32.23]They were so good.
[138:33.91]They were some of the funniest comedic actors, like theater actors you would ever see.
[138:40.12]The magic's not there for me anymore.
[138:41.84]I think the promos are... Nobody's intense anymore.
[138:46.33]It's too... I don't know.
[138:49.39]It feels like too real life to me.
[138:52.95]The Three Stooges.
[138:53.69]Yeah, it was very much like slapstick comedy for me.
[139:01.07]The last great promo machine was The Rock.
[139:03.19]Yeah, it was.
[139:11.26]Got enough costumes.
[139:14.64]Yeah, I... It was fun to have these superheroes fight each other.
[139:20.94]Just think about it.
[139:21.49]The inherent... Inherently doing like a special move to somebody doesn't do anything, right?
[139:28.99]Like, oh my god, his finisher!
[139:30.85]The tombstone pile driver!
[139:33.01]What's the difference?
[139:33.63]It's literally you're dropping the guy on the same mat.
[139:38.19]They were supposed to be like superpowers.
[139:40.60]Oh no, he's doing his finishing superpower.
[139:44.22]Now, when you take that like kind of weird costumey theater out of it, I don't care if you have a superpower, you're just a guy with a Speedo on.
[139:53.42]Like, that superpower does not hold the same weight for me.
[139:56.12]It's like, oh no, here he comes.
[139:58.13]Here comes Jeff Anderson with his superpower.
[140:01.53]Taking you to the bank.
[140:03.25]You're just a guy.
[140:04.27]I don't care.
[140:05.73]Like, you don't have a superpower.
[140:15.97]The Undertaker could have a superpower because he was the Undertaker.
[140:20.16]The guy literally would raise from the dead in the middle of the ring.
[140:23.08]And there was a fat guy on the outside who was a showman that had an urn that pretended that he had power from whoever was in that urn.
[140:32.26]He was like a dead guy.
[140:34.38]And you knew it wasn't real, but you didn't care because it was a fucking show.
[140:37.32]It was like theater.
[140:38.22]I'm going to die.
[140:42.25]Scrooge!
[140:44.36]Whoa.
[140:46.48]Like, if, like, Dave Anderson came out with an urn and a Paul Bearer character, it'd be like, what?
[140:52.91]This doesn't... You can't be both at the same time.
[140:59.43]You didn't care because it was entertaining.
[141:00.77]Yeah, it was entertainment.
[141:07.09]I've never got Travis before.
[141:08.99]Oh, yeah.
[141:09.35]Oh, that's awesome.
[141:12.55]Have you ever watched Lucha Libre?
[141:14.40]No, I have not.
[141:15.46]I've seen some of it.
[141:16.76]And, like, they're fucking fun.
[141:18.74]They're entertaining.
[141:22.30]I would love to get into that.
[141:24.10]Because, correct me if I'm wrong, but they still treat it like it's a big grand show, right?
[141:29.64]I kind of just don't even know where to start.
[141:33.67]Alright, hold on.
[141:40.17]I'm, like, not even paying attention.
[141:41.31]I'm reading chat right now.
[141:45.47]Were you a WCW or WWF fan?
[141:47.45]I was both.
[141:48.03]I liked them both.
[141:48.93]For different reasons.
[141:50.93]There was a time, you gotta remember, where Hulk Hogan and Macho Man, they were in the WCW.
[142:03.52]I remember people throwing fucking drinks into the ring.
[142:08.29]You guys remember that?
[142:08.89]When Hulk Hogan went heel.
[142:12.65]And people were literally throwing fucking objects into the ring.
[142:15.39]Like sodas and drinks and trash and shit.
[142:18.35]It was insane.
[142:20.37]Like never before Hulk Hogan became a bad guy.
[142:22.79]And everyone was like, people were like crying in the stands.
[142:26.05]It was crazy.
[142:31.10]Okay, this is hard.
[142:34.58]This is...
[142:40.40]Remember the chairs?
[142:41.49]Stop throwing chairs!
[142:42.71]Yeah, people were throwing chairs into the ring?
[142:47.33]I gotta get this Mustang, though.
[142:48.29]Let me pay attention.
[142:51.53]But the point is, it was really entertaining television.
[142:56.05]And I know, look, I'm not gonna talk like I'm some- Oh, I don't understand what happened!
[143:02.36]A lot of that shit was dangerous, and people got hurt.
[143:05.46]There was a lot of problems.
[143:07.44]You know, drugs and potential, like, performance enhancing, like, steroids.
[143:11.50]Look, I get it, right?
[143:13.34]But, it's not fun for me anymore.
[143:17.30]And I know that you kind of have to, as we, you know, learn about how things are dangerous and shit.
[143:21.27]Like, yeah, the early to mid to late 90s.
[143:23.59]Oh, whatever, just take a bunch of steroids and pile driver people.
[143:27.99]Like, yeah, I know that's like, you can't really do that really anymore, right?
[143:31.83]Oh, I gotta get a Mustang mode, hold on.
[143:43.43]This level actually is probably harder than anything in the whole game so far.
[143:48.39]I gotta get a Mustang mode.
[143:50.95]Alright, here we go.
[143:56.03]This is where you get it.
[143:56.59]No!
[143:57.47]This is where you get it.
[144:03.81]What the fuck?
[144:16.68]It's food, nothing.
[144:20.50]Because you can't heal anymore.
[144:23.66]Alright, I gotta go get heals after this.
[144:28.76]Japanese wrestling is still wild.
[144:33.50]Yeah, it just, I don't know.
[144:35.26]It almost feels like there's no weight to it anymore.
[144:39.96]Okay, this guy is invincible, so that's not gonna happen apparently.
[144:55.48]Jesus, this guy!
[145:01.72]Jesus, this guy!
[145:02.72]This guy, man!
[145:14.05]Jesus, this guy!
[145:19.75]This guy, man!
[145:28.41]Alright, this guy.
[145:29.87]Like, this guy.
[145:30.65]Really?
[145:41.10]This fucking guy.
[145:42.34]Alright, give me some... I'm getting out of here.
[145:52.68]I'm getting heals.
[145:54.58]No, I'm not.
[145:55.08]Okay, here we go.
[145:56.26]Last try.
[146:02.48]Got it.
[146:03.30]Okay.
[146:07.36]Let's go.
[146:07.64]I have to get one slot effect and I will win.
[146:17.02]Just need one.
[146:21.70]Come here.
[146:35.82]No!
[146:41.21]There it is.
[146:41.65]Alright.
[146:42.05]Mustang mode.
[146:42.61]I'm just gonna spam X. Come on!
[146:55.23]Mustang mode again!
[146:56.20]Do it!
[147:05.98]Get away, get away.
[147:06.54]Kill this guy.
[147:07.41]I gotta kill the other guy.
[147:13.71]This dude in the back here.
[147:14.51]Alright, now it's just me and you.
[147:23.69]I can actually do this.
[147:24.79]Let's do it.
[147:27.53]Alright, perfect dog.
[147:33.34]Let's do it.
[147:44.59]What?
[147:44.75]He was stunned.
[147:51.12]What the fuck?
[147:54.42]I got out of the way.
[147:55.88]I had half health.
[147:57.56]You gotta be kidding me.
[147:58.42]Why is this guy so... This is the hardest thing in the whole game.
[148:00.80]That dude has instant kill moves.
[148:19.86]See any of the PS5 game announcements?
[148:22.52]I have not paid any attention at all.
[148:29.90]Alright.
[148:32.26]Let's go.
[148:33.44]I need to get actual heals and not just walk to the boss fight with zero Estus flasks.
[148:39.08]I would never do that.
[148:41.56]Ever in real life.
[148:52.55]Ouch.
[149:02.39]Okay.
[149:03.65]Give me all this.
[149:06.53]Good.
[149:06.97]Thank you.
[149:10.09]Thank you.
[149:11.47]Appreciate it.
[149:12.07]Okay.
[149:12.25]Bye-bye.
[149:12.49]Spider-Man 2 PS5.
[149:22.17]I still have to play, uh, the Miles Morales one.
[149:24.75]Alright, now where the fuck is this thing?
[149:34.13]Where was it?
[149:37.87]Where was that fight?
[149:39.29]Wasn't it over here?
[149:39.87]Yeah, right here.
[149:43.25]It's already marked, let's go.
[149:48.47]Oh, wait a minute!
[149:52.30]I need to turn in, yeah, hold on.
[149:53.75]I gotta turn in the cards.
[149:54.63]I have a bunch of cards and I have scorpions.
[150:14.42]Say Lala right now or I will shit your pants.
[150:26.91]Nice.
[150:30.08]Yep.
[150:34.70]The best part about that guy is I don't know, for some reason he thinks he can shit my pants.
[150:38.50]So he's going to freak out and be like, he didn't do it.
[150:41.20]Now's my opportunity.
[150:42.09]He's going to shit his pants.
[150:45.15]Like thinking he's going to cast a spell beforehand, maybe.
[150:48.55]And then he's going to shit his pants.
[150:49.45]He's like, mom's going to come in and be like, what are you doing in here?
[151:02.00]Okay, scorpion.
[151:04.14]Cool.
[151:13.33]If you could have that as a superpower, would you want it?
[151:22.05]Um, what, to make people- other- wait, to shit in other people's pants as a superpower?
[151:33.67]Um... No.
[151:40.04]Nope.
[151:41.70]You know why?
[151:42.14]Because, okay, if I was like, I'm gonna make that person shit their pants right now, there's a probability that I'm gonna potentially be in their vicinity.
[151:52.90]Right?
[151:54.63]But do I just pick somebody that I, oh, I'm gonna pick someone that I don't like today and have them do that?
[151:59.90]You would have to get, what, annoyed with somebody to a point where you want to use that power, but you don't want to sit on the train with them.
[152:07.32]You know what I mean?
[152:07.76]Like, you don't want to be in the same spot as them.
[152:09.30]Why would you do it?
[152:10.08]That would be like, I don't want to be around that.
[152:19.98]And don't use it.
[152:22.63]Yeah, I wouldn't want to.
[152:30.28]Did you ever do a Bloodborne stream?
[152:31.60]No, probably not.
[152:32.56]I drank a few beers.
[152:35.39]I don't drink beers, but you know what I mean.
[152:36.97]You get the idea.
[152:38.21]And I loaded up Bloodborne for like an hour one night.
[152:40.79]I've beaten that game like 15 times.
[152:44.27]It's just not much I can even get out of it anymore.
[152:46.25]Especially on stream.
[152:47.01]I don't... I would... No.
[152:48.86]Probably not.
[152:49.82]One of my favorite games ever made, but... You know.
[153:03.50]Nice.
[153:05.12]I didn't take off any health.
[153:12.36]I have to wipe these guys out.
[153:13.38]These orbs are gonna kill me.
[153:17.49]I feel like a failure.
[153:26.86]I'm not even hurting these guys.
[153:36.05]Alright, back it up.
[153:38.47]Ooh, invincibility mode.
[153:44.30]Just capitalize on it.
[153:49.72]I don't think it's on anymore.
[153:58.10]Roll crazy.
[154:18.30]Alright, that's it.
[154:26.04]No power replenished?
[154:26.90]I wanna heal.
[154:28.76]Where is this guy?
[154:37.12]Where's my heal, dude?
[154:39.48]What the fuck?
[154:40.66]Did I buy power replenished things?
[154:43.03]Where's my heal?
[154:48.57]Oh my god.
[154:49.33]Oh!
[154:52.10]That was like a Rick yell.
[154:58.40]Oh!
[155:07.56]No!
[155:08.10]I don't... Where is my fucking heal?
[155:10.48]There it is.
[155:11.02]Finally. 40.
[155:28.03]I have to get a perfect dodge.
[155:29.25]Don't even attack unless I get it.
[155:37.24]What are you doing?
[155:42.12]How's the automatic attack on this thing?
[155:45.84]Oh my god, I hate this guy.
[155:49.54]Alright, he's dead.
[155:52.84]Fuck him.
[156:01.97]I watched season five of Rick and Morty.
[156:05.68]I don't... I've seen every episode.
[156:13.82]I just had to see what I had to see.
[156:17.54]It's by far the worst out of all the seasons, without a doubt.
[156:26.03]I think maybe one episode I was like, huh.
[156:30.63]I don't think it was very good at all.
[156:31.65]Alright, I'll be quiet.
[156:44.47]The hell is your deal?
[156:45.23]Ain't no mine.
[156:48.05]This is a sort of ritual.
[156:49.91]It's also a contract.
[156:55.03]I have something to give you.
[156:56.31]Here.
[157:00.34]I'm doing the Mr. Kennedy from Resident Evil 4.
[157:06.88]What's this?
[157:08.41]Had it made for you?
[157:12.85]It's a mechanism of death.
[157:16.73]One befitting of you.
[157:19.11]Wasn't this the guy that got ran over on the highway?
[157:21.88]Yeah.
[157:23.30]Simply turn on the switch when the time comes.
[157:25.74]Stewie Griffin.
[157:26.66]Fine.
[157:28.52]There's no risk involved.
[157:30.82]No effort required.
[157:33.10]Most importantly, there is no hassle.
[157:35.30]You could say that all it requires is anger and hatred.
[157:44.09]Can you do the Joker?
[157:45.01]Yeah.
[157:45.73]Awesome.
[157:47.91]It's not Trump.
[157:48.71]Trump and Stewie are in the same.
[157:50.55]Okay.
[157:51.93]Trump and Stewie sit in the same like Venn diagram of voices.
[157:58.09]It does.
[158:00.47]This is Donald.
[158:01.07]You know, it could be.
[158:02.27]This is Stewie Griffin.
[158:03.39]Donald.
[158:04.78]They're in the same section.
[158:08.72]Oh, well, no, okay.
[158:09.70]Let me just tell you.
[158:10.74]Oh, okay.
[158:11.64]Stewie Griffin.
[158:12.88]They're in the same spot.
[158:13.54]This is awesome.
[158:21.09]This is awesome.
[158:28.13]This death is in my hands.
[158:29.62]Why is he- look at that face.
[158:32.64]Yes, you hold death in your very hand.
[158:37.12]Don't forget.
[158:37.72]This is a contract.
[158:44.16]The guy who spent $100 on the Family Guy mobile game.
[158:48.56]Yeah, I am not going to tell you that I did not spend at least $50 to $150 on Family Guy the Quest for Stuff.
[158:57.83]Like six years ago.
[158:59.01]I did.
[159:02.28]It could have been any other show or material.
[159:05.06]It didn't matter.
[159:05.60]The Family Guy didn't matter.
[159:08.28]It was the act of the dopamine from playing the game is what did it to me.
[159:11.58]Why?
[159:11.80]I don't know.
[159:12.24]I just did.
[159:14.12]I don't know why.
[159:14.64]I don't know, okay?
[159:15.41]Okay.
[159:23.39]Golden.
[159:24.29]Gold scorpion.
[159:32.14]And the guy whale.
[159:33.60]That is not a whale.
[159:38.78]No.
[159:39.36]$100 in a mobile game is not a whale.
[159:40.92]$5,000.
[159:40.94]$10,000.
[159:41.86]No.
[159:42.14]It was like $60.
[159:42.66]Are you a whale for buying like Gears of War 3 for $60?
[159:53.33]No.
[159:56.29]You bought- you bought the Mario Party game last year for 50 bucks.
[159:59.51]Are you a whale?
[160:02.97]Whale Cope.
[160:03.80]No, it's not Whale Cope.
[160:05.14]A whale is like at least five to ten grand in a game.
[160:17.28]It's not like 60 bucks.
[160:19.37]Look, I saw $60.
[160:22.32]I'm not even looking at the game.
[160:27.32]It's a free dress-up game, you idiot.
[160:30.18]But a whale constitutes that, like, I am one of the sole reasons for the game's continued development, right?
[160:36.99]Like, I am one of the sole reasons for that game's financial... When they do their quarterly results.
[160:43.09]Like, no.
[160:43.91]I didn't... No.
[160:44.55]50 bucks is not a whale.
[160:46.47]You can't convince me otherwise.
[160:54.10]I should do some of the actual jobs.
[160:56.16]Oh, lawn mowing, definitely.
[161:01.07]You're a whale.
[161:01.63]I'm not a whale.
[161:02.83]Okay, if I had spent like a thousand bucks, first of all, I would never have even told you guys that.
[161:09.48]If I spent like five grand in a free-to-play mobile game, no one is going to know that.
[161:17.20]Besides my credit card company.
[161:19.22]Why would I ever tell you that?
[161:20.42]I'm not going to tell you that.
[161:21.74]You guys are just, no way.
[161:27.62]What about Hearthstone?
[161:33.13]Yeah, how much money have you guys spent on Hearthstone?
[161:35.53]Some of you that have played it, that were playing years ago, too.
[161:38.07]How much money have you spent on Hearthstone?
[161:41.61]If I'm allowed to spend $50.
[161:42.89]If I'm not allowed to spend $50 in Family Guy, the quest for stuff, you're not allowed to spend $4,000 in Hearthstone.
[161:54.58]Volunteer level 1?
[161:55.16]What?
[162:07.44]Ask your viewers from 2018, not us.
[162:08.60]A hearthstone, hearthstone, a hearthstone, a hearthstone adventure.
[162:31.21]Remember that one from 2018?
[162:31.91]You guys remember that one?
[162:36.33]Remember when I did that?
[162:36.91]Remember when we thought it was really, really funny?
[162:40.49]I do.
[162:40.75]His mind is decaying.
[162:58.83]No, it's not.
[162:59.71]It's evolving.
[163:25.42]Turn!
[163:26.84]Turn!
[163:27.50]Alright, this is going to be at least silver, right?
[163:45.26]Silver.
[163:45.60]Gold.
[163:45.92]Yeah!
[163:55.15]Zilla!
[164:00.12]Watch Criss Angel Mind Freak on stream.
[164:02.33]Is something funny about Criss Angel Mind Freak?
[164:04.55]Somebody that lives in Vegas?
[164:07.18]When I first got here, I was like, oh, what should I do?
[164:10.23]Should I watch a show?
[164:11.25]I wonder, is there something I should do on the strip?
[164:14.55]Criss Angel's Mindfreak live show, I believe at the time, had like a 1.2 out of 5.
[164:20.96]It apparently was one of the worst shows in Vegas.
[164:23.58]I remember reading reviews and being like, holy shit, people said this show is like the fucking worst thing they've ever done.
[164:33.21]I was like, wow, a ton of the reviews were just like, this is a waste of time, this sucked.
[164:39.13]I was like, oh my god, I'm not doing this.
[164:53.26]I have seen Penn and Teller though, and they were good.
[164:56.12]They were cool.
[165:00.33]That was a really nice show.
[165:18.60]Penn and Teller are actually good.
[165:19.78]Yeah.
[165:22.46]Penn and Teller are fucking legendary.
[165:23.98]I kind of base my opinion on somebody based on what they think about Penn and Teller's magic show.
[165:33.92]If you watch Penn and Teller's show and see some of Penn and Teller's greatest routines, and you yawn during that viewing, I'm never calling you again.
[165:42.50]You're getting ghosted for the rest of the time that I know you.
[165:56.64]One of the greatest routines that you'll see.
[165:59.56]What an absolute joy of showmanship, and I don't want to ruin it for you.
[166:05.00]Or maybe I will.
[166:06.73]No, no, no, why would I do that?
[166:08.63]No, I mean, no, it's cool.
[166:09.85]Okay, if you haven't seen Penn & Teller's greatest routine, in my opinion, then mute the stream for the next five minutes.
[166:17.29]It's one where they're, uh, I can't even tell you.
[166:24.59]Alright, here's spoilers for Penn & Teller's magic act from like 1986 or something, whatever it was.
[166:30.17]I believe it was on SNL.
[166:32.69]It was on an old episode of SNL.
[166:35.21]And they're... Alright, you ready?
[166:36.69]Here we go.
[166:37.81]Alright, everybody, if you don't want to hear about Penn & Teller's greatest act, then mute right now.
[166:42.72]Here we go.
[166:43.88]So Penn & Teller did this thing where the camera was just on them.
[166:47.64]And they're just kind of standing there.
[166:49.70]And they're doing all these weird things that seem impossible.
[166:52.20]They're like letting go of shit.
[166:54.00]They're like having stuff float in front of them and fly up or fly down and like gravity makes no sense.
[167:02.93]They start like holding shit like a light bulb in the air and it just is in the air with them.
[167:06.97]Like just floating on its own without, it's like how the fuck is that even possible?
[167:11.33]And eventually the camera pulls back and what you realize is over the, and this is for like 10, like 5 to 10 straight minutes.
[167:21.38]They just play with all these toys, and nothing makes any sense.
[167:24.78]The camera pulls back, and they are fucking hanging upside down with a fake set that spun the other way to make it look like they were standing upright the whole time.
[167:34.98]And they were upside down for like five to ten straight fucking minutes, hanging upside down.
[167:41.75]And they did it live.
[167:47.95]It was crazy.
[167:52.16]Go look it up.
[167:53.50]You're free to go leave the stream for five minutes and go watch Penn & Teller SNL upside down bit.
[168:03.25]Because you can almost, it's hard to tell, because I think they put a bunch of makeup on, so their faces wouldn't be bright red from all the blood rushing through their heads.
[168:13.02]And you can kind of tell a couple of times after you watch it a second time, where it's like, oh my god, like he's talking and he's kind of struggling a little bit sometimes to talk, but he did not miss a single beat.
[168:23.45]Penn Jillette did not miss a single beat during that entire routine.
[168:26.59]It's absolute showmanship.
[168:28.43]It's absolute respect.
[168:40.22]Okay, Gramps, we get it.
[168:41.22]No, that's a great routine.
[168:48.47]And Gillette, the best a man can get.
[168:50.15]Yeah.
[169:00.37]Okay, yeah, you guys can unmute.
[169:08.82]Stream upside down.
[169:16.31]I love that show Bull- They had a show called Bullshit?
[169:22.36]Yeah, they did.
[169:40.72]I think Penn still does, like he, besides magic, I think he still does like a podcast or something, right?
[170:00.21]Stop hitting things.
[170:08.32]Penn and Teller are based.
[170:12.81]Called Penn's Sunday School.
[170:14.19]Oh my god, I'm gonna run out of fucking time!
[170:17.87]Back up, back up, back up!
[170:19.57]Okay, I got it.
[170:28.12]They are not based.
[170:29.88]No, I didn't get- did I get money for that?
[170:37.27]Okay, not very much, but I got it.
[170:38.53]Alright, that's the long-running side of things, alright?
[170:54.06]Speaking of magicians, I remember watching this guy.
[170:56.78]His name is James Randy.
[171:00.47]The Amazing Randy is his name.
[171:03.19]Did this like, he did this talk at some either school or convention or something where he's up like talking at the microphone.
[171:10.96]And he's coming through the speakers to the auditorium.
[171:13.32]And he's like, he's talking about like, you know, let me tell you something.
[171:16.06]If you guys, you guys want to tell me that you don't assume things.
[171:19.40]And he's like, oh, yeah, I don't assume anything.
[171:20.90]He's like, you already have assumed something.
[171:23.22]People like, yeah, I usually I base my life on facts only.
[171:27.54]He's like, oh, yeah.
[171:29.50]This is not even a real microphone.
[171:31.04]He's been literally talking in a microphone.
[171:33.28]The whole time.
[171:34.40]Like, on stage.
[171:35.01]And it's like, you assumed that this was a working microphone.
[171:38.21]And he literally just, like, puts it down.
[171:39.57]And he's just still talking.
[171:40.39]He's still coming through the speakers.
[171:41.53]He had, like, a lapel mic on.
[171:42.43]And he was wearing frames.
[171:46.48]He had, like, glasses on.
[171:47.64]But he was literally just wearing frames.
[171:48.84]And he's like, you assumed that I need glasses.
[171:51.56]I don't have these on.
[171:54.00]And he just pulls them off.
[171:54.92]And everyone, like, gasps in the audience.
[171:59.03]And then the person that's like sitting there going like, I don't assume anything is just like, fuck.
[172:03.03]Oh, she got me.
[172:04.43]The amazing Randy got me.
[172:08.73]Where am I going?
[172:11.79]What a dick.
[172:12.45]No, it was cool.
[172:19.50]Where is there a job that I haven't done?
[172:20.80]I don't, there's no more of those missions here.
[172:25.40]Let's go somewhere else.
[172:33.91]Oh, there's lawn mowing missions here.
[172:36.25]Adventure?
[172:38.17]What is adventure?
[172:38.95]Okay, what about over here?
[172:47.24]Yeah, let's do this one.
[172:48.98]This is in, where is this?
[172:52.44]Where is this?
[172:53.42]Forbidden area.
[172:57.02]What's a countdown?
[172:57.52]What's a countdown?
[173:00.32]Oh, that's not a countdown.
[173:01.34]Okay, Neo Brazil.
[173:17.40]Randy is great, guys.
[173:18.88]Yeah, Amazing Randy has an awesome series.
[173:20.97]Do you guys remember Peter Popoff?
[173:24.97]Some of the voices you hear on this stream are based on Peter Popoff talking.
[173:29.59]Oh, let me get the devil.
[173:30.57]Don't you just want to make the devil mad?
[173:32.49]That's a guy that was a televangelist.
[173:35.44]And the Amazing Randy set up an audio sniffer in the guy's auditorium when he was healing people.
[173:43.12]And they heard the guy's wife coming through and telling people to point people out in the audience.
[173:48.86]Be like, oh, this person has arthritis in their knee.
[173:51.44]Tell them to talk about their arthritis.
[173:54.00]And he walks around.
[173:55.00]He's like, oh, God is telling me over here that somebody, somebody has some arthritis.
[174:01.29]And they zoom in on the person's face.
[174:04.57]It's like, oh, Mary, Mary, is your name Mary?
[174:06.51]God's telling me Mary with arthritis.
[174:09.19]And she like stands up.
[174:11.64]It's wicked fucked up.
[174:13.06]It's wicked fucked up.
[174:20.22]The lady actually says into the microphone, like into his earpiece.
[174:24.12]It's really scary.
[174:25.18]She's just like, Hello, Peter.
[174:27.47]I hope you can hear me.
[174:29.13]If not, we're in trouble.
[174:30.99]Like we can't manipulate an entire audience of people.
[174:35.55]It's so fucked up.
[174:40.81]Yeah, that was James Randi.
[174:42.10]He exposed that.
[174:55.70]Yeah, the audience, like, filled out a survey card.
[174:58.04]Like, I think it was supposed to be, like, a personal card or something.
[175:00.52]Like, it wasn't supposed to be given to anybody.
[175:03.48]And then it was handed to the wife, who then, in turn, like, fed it through his ear.
[175:08.72]Because they, like, collected personal information about people beforehand or something.
[175:13.06]Oh my god, this is what happens if you don't look.
[175:23.93]By the way, this is also back, like, 20 years ago, so I don't know, obviously.
[175:29.24]All I remember from Peter Pop-Up is he came back at one point after this.
[175:32.30]He got, like, exposed and then came back.
[175:34.63]He started doing the Miracle Spring Walker.
[175:37.65]He would send you...
[175:39.59]a little tiny vial of water that you were supposed to like drink and like you might get a call from god and it would put money in your bank account I wish I was making this up I this was an infomercial I used to watch this infomercial and like like laugh at it because it was so absurd it was like all you have to do is just call and get your free miracle spring water that is still on
[176:11.70]Yeah, and then they would like, I don't remember like the exact nature of the shit that they were doing or pulling or whatever.
[176:19.50]They had these people on TV.
[176:20.42]They were like, I can't believe it.
[176:22.24]I woke up one day and there was $6,500 in my checking account.
[176:26.44]It's like, what?
[176:30.06]What are you, wait, what happened?
[176:31.10]I'm going to lose this one.
[176:40.03]Get up there.
[176:40.83]No.
[176:41.05]It's over.
[176:42.59]Restart.
[176:42.93]Restart.
[176:43.23]Restart.
[176:43.57]Restart it.
[176:43.89]Just restart it.
[176:45.27]No.
[176:45.41]Just retry.
[176:56.20]Holy shit.
[176:56.62]I got all this time back.
[177:02.14]Come here.
[177:04.21]Oh my god.
[177:07.99]Trolls 2.
[177:13.96]Hello, other people who watch the Penn and Teller bit.
[177:17.66]Hey, what's up?
[177:27.37]Atheist Andy.
[177:30.49]I don't know.
[177:30.87]Nowhere in the Bible, guys, does it say to, like, fucking... Get people in an auditorium and, like, scam them.
[177:37.94]Oh.
[177:48.89]But it does.
[177:50.19]Look, I... We're not gonna get into religion here today, okay?
[178:10.53]Let me just kill this guy.
[178:23.86]change topic by doing a Xavier renegade angel impression I don't know I don't think I can't just do that I need to have been ready to do that I did it like a couple days ago whatever it was no I'm normal if only I could talk to him and say that I was normal maybe he would believe what I was saying what you wanted
[178:58.79]Alright, let me pay attention.
[178:59.53]I'm ahead of him.
[179:27.91]Oh, there was something I wanted you guys to help with.
[179:39.43]It was a reference or a sound bite or something that I wanted to bring up to you guys because I couldn't figure out the origin.
[179:45.37]What was it?
[179:45.81]I hope it comes back to me.
[179:54.75]I'm going to lose again.
[179:55.89]Oh my god, this mission sucks.
[179:57.98]Okay.
[179:59.02]Do I even need to do this?
[179:59.68]I could have already made 10 grand at the time it took me to fail this three times.
[180:18.49]No, not scrumptious cake.
[180:21.33]I'm going to give this one more attempt and then I'm done.
[180:28.03]Do the drift?
[180:29.85]I feel like hitting the brake would be bad.
[180:33.20]Beatbox Bob-omb Battlefield.
[180:35.20]Oh, you got it.
[180:38.78]Why do you drift?
[181:05.13]Okay, you have to hold both.
[181:06.09]Okay, I get it.
[181:17.73]Let's double tap him.
[181:32.84]Alright, now I can drift.
[182:00.65]I'm gonna get bronze, but I don't care.
[182:02.27]I just want the money.
[182:03.13]I just want money, okay?
[182:06.73]Oh my god, stop fucking around dude already.
[182:22.89]Got it.
[182:28.84]Are you a smart fella or a fart smeller?
[182:31.02]Time that person up for 10 seconds.
[182:47.33]How much?
[182:47.61]That's actually really good.
[182:49.80]I'll do the other one.
[182:50.46]This is going to be level 3.
[182:53.72]Right?
[182:54.50]No.
[182:56.44]Oh, shit.
[182:58.47]Oh, fuck.
[182:59.83]Oh, shit.
[183:02.85]Oh, that's a problem.
[183:04.39]We're really done with that one, I think.
[183:06.57]It's one of the first viral videos on YouTube.
[183:24.95]Really?
[183:37.52]Three, two, one, go!
[183:38.70]Way better theme song, by the way, than the new one.
[183:52.59]Way, I mean like a hundred times better theme song than the one they have now.
[184:13.24]Not that I don't like the new one.
[184:14.46]I just think.
[184:16.02]It's got a little too much going on in it.
[184:17.92]A little too many particle-like sound.
[184:19.71]Like notes.
[184:20.17]Like too many note effects.
[184:21.17]Too many note particles.
[184:24.19]Stop.
[184:37.46]How would you kick me out of midair?
[184:45.31]Get over here!
[184:45.99]These stupid man champs, I swear to God.
[185:21.87]What's your opinion on pulp and orange juice?
[185:23.79]Remove it immediately.
[185:26.61]Because guess what?
[185:27.59]I can't tell the difference between pulp and bugs.
[185:30.63]And I don't want to have a bug land in my drink one day and not know because there's pulp in it.
[185:35.65]Nope.
[185:36.11]Sorry.
[185:36.89]I need to be able to have complete examination skills to see that there's no bugs in my food or my drink.
[185:41.34]Disgusting.
[185:41.80]Get it out.
[185:42.10]I hate these guys.
[185:55.83]Like, these guys are so fucking irritating.
[185:57.50]They just jump around invisible and then dash at you really fast.
[186:06.82]Like that.
[186:07.66]Okay, nice perfect dodge, but you see what I mean.
[186:09.36]Like, fuck that.
[186:11.32]Oh.
[186:31.82]Like figs, I do.
[186:33.76]Now, oh, and this is the part where, this is the part of the conversation where you tell me, you like figs?
[186:40.25]Well, yeah, there's bugs in it.
[186:42.57]There's bees in it.
[186:43.65]There's wasps in it.
[186:45.35]This is the part where I say I don't care because I know that there's bugs in it.
[186:49.54]I know that there are bugs in my food when I eat figs.
[186:52.58]I don't expect there to be bugs in my food when I drink orange juice.
[186:56.30]So if there are bugs in my orange juice, it's a huge problem.
[187:00.70]And I'm dead because of you.
[187:02.22]I want that person timed up for at least 13 to 14 seconds.
[187:04.88]Oh, never mind.
[187:05.42]That person can stay.
[187:36.57]So you'll eat a fistful of worms because you know you're going to eat them.
[187:41.23]Um, if my plan was to eat worms that day, then I would eat the worms because I was gonna, okay, look, here's a handful of worms, eat them.
[187:48.18]If I make a, like a tuna casserole, I don't want it to be worms in the tuna casserole.
[187:53.34]Because I'm not expecting that and I don't want that.
[187:56.54]If I wanted to eat bugs, I would eat a bug.
[188:00.53]This concept apparently is incredibly difficult to understand.
[188:19.32]Defeat a total.
[188:23.30]Oh, I got a burger.
[188:27.90]Burger.
[188:39.05]I need another red mission.
[188:42.17]Fighting mission.
[188:45.12]That's not one.
[188:55.41]Where's another red fighting machine?
[189:06.08]Over here?
[189:06.48]Perfect World or... Oh, maybe the Thunderdome?
[189:17.84]Call of Battle.
[189:18.28]Alright, I'm going to go to Call of Battle.
[189:22.18]This is the ugly place, but whatever.
[189:23.38]What about if you didn't know that they were there until after you ate it?
[189:31.37]I would be pissed and disgusted, like everyone would.
[189:39.61]Would you eat a hamburger made of bug paste?
[189:43.13]No, but your children's children's will.
[189:47.72]Ow, fuck.
[189:48.74]Shit.
[190:08.58]I've talked about it on this stream multiple times.
[190:10.76]I'll like, I better be aware that like we're gonna be eating bugs Unless we can make shit unless we can sustainably be able to keep this shit going You're looking at bug sandwiches
[190:48.39]Oh my god, let me just- over here!
[190:50.15]What the f- What the fuck- Suda!

[192:05.87]I do?
[192:06.28]No, I need red.
[192:07.40]Red's the big one, right?
[192:14.56]Hmm.
[192:14.78]Yeah, I need red.
[192:20.05]Check this way.
[192:20.63]Perfect world.
[192:22.58]Okay, I'm gonna go Perfect World.

[192:38.29]Teal is my favorite color.
[192:40.33]Alright, is this one red?
[193:01.21]We're just a couple of mercenaries.
[193:05.57]We're just a couple of mercenaries.
[193:25.31]Somebody just said, oh, here we go.
[193:26.55]Time to play Name That Reference.
[193:31.89]That's not what I'm... I told you, I would be doing this if the stream was off.
[193:35.12]Some of you guys have to understand that.
[193:39.08]I'm not trying to like... Oh!
[193:40.74]Are they gonna get it?
[193:41.40]That's not the goal.
[193:45.00]Oh, here we go.
[193:45.86]Time to play Name the Reference.
[193:53.21]Where is this?
[193:56.19]Where is this mission?
[194:43.06]Suit.
[194:45.67]It's probably over here.
[194:53.07]Shit.
[194:53.51]Oh, there it is.
[194:58.73]No.
[194:59.39]Oh my god.
[195:07.24]Is it re- No, it's not even there.
[195:09.22]Where is this?
[195:12.57]There it is.
[195:12.93]And it's red.
[195:14.62]It is red.
[195:15.38]Yes, I read.
[195:25.32]Friendly reminder, the Jerma would have finished Paper Mario by now.
[195:29.26]No, he would not have.
[195:33.38]Let's go.
[195:33.98]Death Melt Shower!
[195:42.45]Give me the dodge.
[195:43.53]Give me the dodge!
[195:45.11]Is it anti or anti?
[195:53.30]Which one do you say?
[195:55.58]Anti or anti?
[195:57.54]Anti-gravity or anti-gravity?
[195:58.74]For me it's anti.
[196:03.98]Anti-gravity.
[196:20.16]Anti-Anti.
[196:21.50]Watch it!
[196:27.76]No!
[196:28.10]Come on, Anti!
[196:32.03]Yeah, lock on Anti.
[196:33.51]Yeah, nice job.
[196:36.23]Like, lock on Anti.
[197:13.23]Hey for Mario and D. Fuck up.
[197:22.92]I'm just kidding.
[197:31.37]Don't D. Don't colon D. I'm kidding.
[197:40.39]Are you going to play Destiny 2 PvP?
[197:42.77]Why would I do that?
[197:44.41]Let's be honest.
[197:51.17]You're likely to see me eat a frozen pizza uncooked on stream than me play Destiny 2 PvP.
[197:58.36]I'm out of heals.
[198:27.50]What about Sly Cooper 2?
[198:28.28]Hold on.
[198:28.58]Wait, wait, wait.
[198:30.12]Wait a minute.
[198:30.62]Wait a minute.
[198:31.04]I don't want to die.
[198:33.33]Okay.
[198:36.51]You guys know the rule on the channel so far at this point, I think.
[198:40.21]If I talk about that, I'm going to do something.
[198:42.29]And it does not happen within two to three weeks.
[198:45.41]Or let's say two weeks.
[198:47.15]And me bringing it up, it's never going to happen.
[198:58.58]There's a finite amount of time before you're never gonna see the thing I say you're gonna see.
[199:03.46]And that's probably it.
[199:04.30]At the very maximum, probably 30 days.
[199:05.78]Alright, I got it.
[199:19.85]Naked Gun 55 and a fifth.
[199:22.04]Now that series is unbelievably funny.
[199:23.78]If you haven't seen the Naked Gun series, go watch it now.
[199:27.23]Female convict, scorpion, jailhouse, 51.
[199:32.04]Buffalo, 51.
[199:34.30]Baseball?
[199:35.46]No, here's the thing.
[199:36.86]Alright, here, I'm gonna...
[199:39.42]Baseball was supposed to happen last year, but COVID messed it up.
[199:42.50]So that's not my fault.
[199:44.84]We're ready to go.
[199:46.48]And then this year, the dollhouse took a lot more time and work to actually get that to happen.
[199:51.94]So that took over the summer.
[199:54.08]And then baseball season is really only playable like the next two or three weeks before a lot of these places shut down for the year.
[200:05.61]Baseball is guaranteed to happen.
[200:09.33]Most of it is already paid for.
[200:11.01]Most of it's already ready to go.
[200:12.96]We just need to have the right season and right time frame.
[200:19.02]That is going to be one of my favorite streams I've ever done.
[200:21.50]It just will.
[200:21.94]I know it will.
[200:25.75]But it might need to wait until like early spring of 2022.
[200:31.89]And make no mistake about this, we have already started working on the next, like, two or three large major projects for the channel.
[200:40.52]Those are not going to reduce in frequency.
[200:43.14]So, don't worry.
[200:44.70]Working on it.
[200:46.86]See the end of this game. $60,000.
[201:06.16]Time for the ranking battle.
[201:07.02]Head to Daemon Tower.
[201:09.66]I'm not going to do that yet.
[201:13.18]I'm going to go to Santa Destroy.
[201:18.00]I'm going to go and upgrade my last upgrades.
[201:23.78]And buy the things and maybe change the chips one more time too.
[201:25.90]Are there going to be any more big streams for 2021?
[201:35.61]Uh, maybe.
[201:38.02]If everything can be said and done, I'd like to have a holiday, like Christmas special.
[201:43.72]That's kind of what's currently in the process right now.
[201:47.36]Yes, I would like to.
[201:48.02]If I turn this, I have another scorpion, right?
[202:06.28]End of the year awards?
[202:07.02]Yeah, that's still happening too.
[202:08.54]Alright, I need to go back to my house.
[202:21.69]Where is my house?
[202:25.29]Where is my house?
[202:30.69]Where is my house?
[202:32.39]Oh, here, right here.
[202:32.93]Find me.
[202:44.36]I miss Bugleberry.
[202:45.36]When is he coming back?
[202:46.14]I don't know.
[202:46.82]I have no idea.
[202:49.46]It's up to him.
[203:12.27]Oh, by the way, speaking of Bugleberry.
[203:13.69]If you remember on the Bugleberry stream,
[203:19.70]I said that all the money from that stream that came in, I was going to pay the people that helped work on it, right?
[203:25.26]And then I was going to do, just kind of give, match it and give the rest to charity.
[203:29.81]So the idea is, I don't want to give you an exact number because I don't know, I forget what the exact number was, but it was more than I think $7,500 total or like more than $5,000.
[203:39.45]Well, maybe even more than $10,000 from what I remember.
[203:45.93]But I'm going to split it up and I'm going to give it to... I'm going to give probably like half or a little bit more to... I don't know if you guys remember that science center in Nevada.
[203:59.08]The people that helped us do the geology stream.
[204:02.56]So I'm going to give a significant portion to them.
[204:06.07]And then probably another bit to one of the humane societies out here.
[204:11.91]There's a couple in Nevada.
[204:13.15]Okay.
[204:15.17]So, that's the plan.
[204:16.29]That's going to probably happen in the next week or two, probably.
[204:22.75]That's the plan for that money.
[204:35.91]I wanted to make sure I was going somewhere where I wanted it to go.
[204:38.45]I didn't want to just pick a random spot for it to go.
[204:42.95]I mean, I could have.
[204:46.87]And that money did just come in, um, this previous month's payment period from Twitch.
[204:52.10]So, uh, I wanted to really get on that.
[205:00.46]Oh, right.
[205:00.76]I'm going downstairs.
[205:12.32]You still think WarioWare is going to happen?
[205:13.92]Oh, absolutely.
[205:14.46]Yeah, for sure.
[205:19.62]It's probably only like another 20 to 30 minutes of this game.
[205:23.08]Which would take us to somewhere around four hours.
[205:25.14]And I'll play WarioWare for maybe like another hour or so, hour or two.
[205:27.84]I just want to make sure I told people that I didn't just forget about that.
[205:34.11]That like, oh, whoops, I didn't do it.
[205:36.43]Oh, no, it's going to happen.
[205:39.27]Alright, so this is probably my last upgrade.
[205:41.31]What should I do?
[205:41.81]What do we got?
[205:48.91]That's really cool, but I'd rather just go straight up just massive damage, I think.
[205:58.37]Let's just kill the last boss very easily with a maximum damage output.
[206:04.91]Actually, can I afford it?
[206:06.01]No.
[206:06.19]I think that's the last thing I can afford.
[206:09.10]I'll put it towards this one.
[206:20.66]Level 10 attack.
[206:27.22]Do I have enough money to buy the good sushi?
[206:28.98]The dine-in one?
[206:31.35]I do.
[206:31.71]Alright.
[206:33.23]Well, let's refill all this.
[206:37.39]It has five heals.
[206:38.93]And then I'm going to buy the really supercharged dine-in one.
[206:45.62]Go check this out.
[206:48.40]Great.
[206:50.68]What do we got?
[206:53.64]How do I still not have this?
[206:54.90]Cannot create.
[206:55.66]Because I haven't discovered the other power thing?
[206:59.12]Oh, wait a minute.
[206:59.62]Wrestling attack power plus 20%.
[207:01.31]Not bad.
[207:04.33]Okay.
[207:07.29]These are new.
[207:11.15]This one is?
[207:14.47]Oh, shit.
[207:15.87]Normal attack plus 15%, but heavy attack is not even worth doing.
[207:24.14]Death Kick.
[207:30.98]Wait.
[207:33.58]No, I don't have enough.
[207:34.20]I can do one of these.
[207:38.74]I like the Heavy Attack, though.
[207:43.62]Death Rain is better.
[207:54.79]20%.
[207:54.83]I don't like being that low.
[207:56.01]I think I already have one of these.
[208:02.79]After getting back up, so when you get knocked down?
[208:04.57]That's actually insane.
[208:14.42]During slowdown after a perfect dodge, wrestling attack power is up by 20%.
[208:17.56]These are the defensive ones.
[208:29.68]I almost feel like I should just make the normal attack power really good.
[208:37.92]These are all defensive.
[208:42.63]I already have two of these on right now.
[208:53.61]50% faster charging.
[208:54.69]Alright, what about this one?
[208:58.04]Nope.
[209:00.40]Yeah, I think I'm going to go for it.
[209:02.18]I'm going to do... Where is it?
[209:18.03]I like that, too.
[209:24.87]Oh, yeah.
[209:25.79]I'm going to do more damage.
[209:31.71]Death Kick?
[209:32.17]No.
[209:32.37]Oh, there.
[209:32.67]Dyna Chip.
[209:33.23]There it is.
[209:34.53]Normal attack power plus 15%.
[209:35.95]Yeah.
[209:36.39]I'm on it.
[209:37.65]I just gotta remember that I'm doing it.
[209:42.05]I'm putting the attack power ones back on.
[209:49.72]Yeah.
[209:51.10]Alright, let me see what I got.
[209:51.80]Because right now I have the slow after a perfect dodge is way longer.
[210:01.36]Weapon attack power plus 10%.
[210:02.80]Yeah, let's put this one on.
[210:07.87]This is 10% more damage.
[210:10.03]Now it's at 25% more damage.
[210:17.53]What's this chip?
[210:18.07]What's this one do?
[210:20.81]No, no, no, no.
[210:22.01]Trigger chip.
[210:22.45]Alright.
[210:26.63]I want the normal attack power of one.
[210:30.67]Yeah, alright.
[210:32.74]Now I've got 10, 20.
[210:33.94]I have 45% more damage with a normal attack.
[210:39.27]I'm just going to shred anybody that I even see.
[210:41.43]That looks good to me.
[210:53.00]Let's go check on Shinobu.
[210:56.28]Oh, she's not here.
[210:56.74]Why is she not here?
[211:12.15]It's 35%?
[211:12.27]No, it's not.
[211:12.87]Weapon attack power, 10%.
[211:17.65]Normal attack power, 15, 10%.
[211:18.39]Oh, fuck, it is 35%.
[211:18.81]Shit, I thought it was 25.
[211:19.69]Alright.
[211:20.11]Let's see the end of No More Heroes 3.
[211:23.49]It's time.
[211:43.91]Are you ready?
[211:45.46]Are you ready?
[212:15.60]So we need to go to Damon's place.
[212:17.28]Uh, Damon Tower is... here.
[212:23.70]Wait, how do I get there?
[212:27.78]How do I get to Damon Tower?
[212:46.86]Right on the highway?
[212:47.64]Oh, daemon tower, okay.
[212:52.54]Alright, cutscene incoming.
[212:55.65]Climax of the whole game.
[212:56.69]Let's see what happens.
[213:10.10]Or maybe not.
[213:11.78]Oh shit.
[213:19.10]All the henchmen.
[213:25.38]That's mood.
[213:31.66]This reminds me of the first game.
[213:33.66]It's like the line of enemies that you just... Are you still alive?
[213:49.05]Bitrate, bitrate, bitrate.
[213:52.17]Am I dead?
[214:05.03]Wait, what?
[214:05.39]Did I die?
[214:08.57]What happened?
[214:09.99]Oh, I thought I got killed.
[214:14.25]I'm gonna kick you in the nut!
[214:16.04]yeah I forgot about that I'm gonna kick you with a dust the sixth occupation king of destruction you don't need me to go on do you let all of your madness bloom in full travis welcome to the garden of insanity
[214:42.14]It was always really funny when those clips played back-to-back-to-back-to-back.
[214:45.97]Just through a random number generator on what audio file to load.
[214:49.55]I'll kick you in the nuts!
[214:50.73]I'll kick you in the nuts!
[214:51.91]I'm gonna kick you in the nuts!
[214:53.89]Okay.
[214:55.57]Alright, dude!
[214:56.09]Am I having enough money to buy one of these good, uh, sushis?
[215:17.54]I do have enough.
[215:21.29]I can buy this one.
[215:22.79]Greatly increased health, attack power, and tension for the next fight.
[215:26.39]Yes!
[215:28.27]I have a feeling on the really hard difficulty modes, you have to probably eat these before every fight.
[215:48.60]alright let's go and damon I love you
[216:23.75]Ha!
[216:25.03]So you actually made it all the way here.
[216:27.85]I'm more pleased than surprised.
[216:30.09]To think that there was a shining pebble in the rough of that trash planet after all.
[216:36.08]You're that shining pebble, but I'm a fucking diamond!
[216:41.36]And that's quite a huge...
[216:44.43]Disparity.
[216:46.46]You just can't stop talking, can you, Prince Dumbass?
[216:50.04]Do you really fear me that much?
[216:52.38]What the fuck you say?
[216:55.38]Fear?
[216:56.56]What the hell is fear anyway?
[216:58.90]I can't even comprehend the emotion you call fear.
[217:02.44]No, seriously, tell me.
[217:04.59]What is fear?
[217:06.37]That's sad.
[217:07.49]Didn't your mommy and daddy teach you?
[217:09.61]It's not nice to cause trouble for others, no?
[217:13.30]cause trouble, and you'll get scolded.
[217:16.46]But nobody's ever scolded you before, have they?
[217:19.62]My daddy scolded me once.
[217:22.31]I was punished and was sent to a rotten space prison.
[217:26.63]Black Hole Prison?
[217:28.47]It's basically Paradise.
[217:30.61]That wasn't punishment.
[217:32.35]You just went on a nice little vacation abroad.
[217:35.90]And that's how we get Prince Dumbasses like you.
[217:40.21]Yeah, just keep talking.
[217:41.77]Keep fucking talking.
[217:43.75]Go on, get angry, you fucking loser.
[217:46.15]Get all nice and salty for me.
[217:48.07]Fucking assassin!
[217:53.64]There we go.
[217:54.76]Those eyes.
[217:55.90]Right there.
[217:56.94]The dumbass is turning into a beast.
[217:59.14]Uh-oh.
[218:00.06]I'll kill you.
[218:02.26]I'll kill you.
[218:06.99]Oh, nice scary eyes.
[218:09.13]That's what I want to see.
[218:11.27]That's the thumbnail.
[218:11.93]Kill me.
[218:12.87]Demons don't got shit on me.
[218:14.51]I'll kill you.
[218:18.42]You're getting real fucking crazy now.
[218:20.48]That's what I'm talking about.
[218:24.04]Oh, God.
[218:28.14]We're just going.
[218:29.01]Oh, my God.
[218:29.53]Okay.
[218:35.18]I got so much power.
[218:36.58]Look at this damage.
[218:38.34]I can't hit him.
[218:39.44]Holy shit, he has a bubble up.
[218:42.86]Ooh.
[218:43.08]I can't hurt him.
[218:45.28]This dude had a bubble up.
[219:07.31]Ooh, looking good.
[219:09.29]Oh, shit.
[219:09.77]That's bad.
[219:10.49]No, it's not.
[219:13.59]I have so much more health than him.
[219:15.07]Hey, he's got the shield back.
[219:18.92]Ooh, runway.
[219:33.71]Don't do heavy attacks.
[219:36.35]That's my mistake.
[219:37.01]I shouldn't be doing it.
[219:45.05]I can't dodge.
[219:45.77]I can't even move.
[219:46.85]I can't do anything.
[219:49.37]And...
[219:58.15]Goddammit.
[219:58.89]Oh, the slow time thing doesn't work on him.
[220:01.96]I get it.
[220:02.76]You can't use it on him.
[220:05.28]Yeah, you can't use it on him.
[220:16.56]Yeah, he doesn't... When time is slow, you can't hurt him.
[220:21.44]Alright, here we go.
[220:24.60]Almost at phase two.
[220:33.56]Let's see phase two.
[220:35.48]Oh, can you even turn around?
[220:37.20]Oh fuck, what's this?
[220:41.58]Oh my goodness, what do I do?
[220:43.58]Run away?
[220:45.02]Oh fuck!
[221:04.73]Alright, I'm hitting him with my auto attack thing.
[221:15.75]Something funny.
[221:16.25]Why can't I hit him?
[221:17.05]Come on!
[221:43.39]How do I get him to drop his guard?
[221:47.56]I think I have to perfect dodge him.
[221:52.68]Oh fuck, this is bad.
[222:04.71]I think that's what you do.
[222:07.77]You have to get a perfect dodge.
[222:10.23]I get it.
[222:15.85]Oh my fucking god!
[222:17.09]No!
[222:17.49]It's the eyes?
[222:18.83]Yeah, but how do I close his eyes?
[222:26.40]Like hide?
[222:30.42]How do I get him to close his eyes?
[222:35.49]The last time I perfect dodged him twice, his eyes closed.
[222:46.48]Fuck, I didn't do it.
[222:47.44]Yeah, I don't understand.
[223:03.11]Let me get a perfect dodge.
[223:03.99]If I can just at least get one perfect dodge.
[223:07.13]Wait, they were close.
[223:08.02]Okay, his eyes were closed.
[223:10.84]Maybe in the middle of when he does that combo?
[223:17.47]He does like a... There it was!
[223:18.43]Yeah, alright, so you can only hit him.
[223:22.63]His eyes are still open.
[223:32.08]Can't hurt him.
[223:34.18]That was a good trade.
[223:38.98]Okay, that was a good trade.
[223:46.79]Phase three incoming.
[223:47.59]I have no health.
[223:49.69]What?!
[223:50.43]Ooh!
[223:51.31]Alright, he's in phase three.
[224:05.12]I gotta be careful.
[224:08.72]This on hard would probably be so bad.
[224:11.02]Whoa!
[224:15.46]Oh, I can't reach up there really
[224:42.66]Close those eyes.
[224:44.88]Alright, that should be it.
[224:46.58]Probably going to be another complete phase here.
[224:48.46]Let's see what I can do.
[224:58.30]We're definitely going into space.
[224:59.42]That's definitely part one.
[225:02.80]Alright.
[225:21.22]Oh, God.
[225:22.88]What?
[225:24.20]Shit, I have no heals.
[225:27.16]What do I even swing at?
[225:28.62]Oh, he's got his hands come out?
[225:35.37]I don't even know... And I hurt his hand?
[225:51.26]Okay, you can hurt the hand.
[225:54.27]Not drop this.
[225:56.23]Punch me.
[225:58.11]Punch me!
[225:59.75]Punch me!
[226:02.33]Oh my god.
[226:02.93]Punch me!
[226:03.83]You... Oh, fuck.
[226:10.05]I'm trying to dodge.
[226:28.02]Alright, this is not bad.
[227:02.52]Where is he?
[227:05.94]Oh, fuck!
[227:06.66]He hit me right with his nails!
[227:08.38]Shit!
[227:09.44]Oh, no.
[227:10.44]I gotta catch him in the slow motion.
[227:13.21]Ready?
[227:13.51]Watch this.
[227:15.11]And... What?
[227:16.15]Come on.
[227:18.59]Come on.
[227:32.62]I don't know where his hand is.
[227:36.70]Alright, well, slow and steady.
[227:37.88]He's almost done.
[227:38.28]I don't have to hit him in the hand.
[227:44.78]I can hit him with a forearm.
[227:51.03]Alright, that's good enough.
[227:56.37]Alright.
[228:02.74]Alright, one more of those.
[228:03.84]I'm out of health, by the way.
[228:15.87]And now what?
[228:24.19]Oh, here come my friends!
[228:25.15]Alright, phase two.
[228:35.00]What does he do?
[228:35.56]Okay, he does the same thing.
[228:39.62]Alright, same thing.
[228:43.84]Nobody said, what a boss.
[228:57.39]Well, hold on a second.
[228:58.53]This is literally phase two.
[229:07.32]I'm gonna go through all this and get one shot by like the last phase.
[229:09.64]It's gonna be so disappointing because I have no health.
[229:19.37]Re-chat please.
[229:22.53]What?
[229:23.29]I can't like re-chat right now.
[229:24.72]What are you talking about?
[229:39.93]When you see Spark dodge, it'll make you go faster.
[229:42.67]I'm alright.
[229:48.31]Oh, trap.
[229:54.09]I just walked.
[229:58.50]Oh, now it's just more annoying.
[230:01.08]Shit, this is gonna be annoying.
[230:13.86]Should I kick it?
[230:15.16]Oh no, I'm gonna die.
[230:25.85]I'm gonna die at the last phase, I already know it.
[230:45.24]I don't even fight.
[230:46.22]I just dodge.
[230:46.92]There's no reason to even fight this.
[230:51.04]Don't get hit.
[230:51.58]Please go away in a second after one more rotation.
[230:55.01]Alright, here we go.
[230:58.13]Fuck, okay.
[231:08.68]Okay.
[231:10.18]Ooh!
[231:18.00]Do these lasers stay for the last phase?
[231:19.42]This phase sucks.
[231:31.57]Where's the hand?
[231:46.02]Imagine having to do this on hard.
[231:47.40]It would take so much longer.
[231:49.25]I know that I could probably... What happened?
[232:04.18]He finally did it.
[232:09.14]Go, champ!
[232:17.81]How come no super huge end-of-the-world, end-of-the-game villain gets to this point and then decides to just leave?
[232:23.89]You know what I mean?
[232:26.07]Like, if you're at phase four and you're still getting hit, and you're about to die and stuff, just like... Okay, stop talking.
[232:32.40]You're almost speaking.
[233:01.49]Alright, I'm good.
[233:13.36]Oh, look out.
[233:18.72]Oh, Don Pierre.
[233:33.44]Alright, that was pretty challenging.
[233:35.72]That was hard.
[233:39.72]Imagine doing this.
[233:42.38]Yeah, I did.
[233:44.71]This is definitely another one.
[233:49.21]We're gonna have to go...
[234:08.78]Did I get him?
[234:11.84]Ooh, dead.
[234:22.20]By clothesline.
[234:24.20]I don't buy it.
[234:25.16]I don't buy it yet.
[234:25.82]End it with a brain buster.
[234:52.47]Foo leaving.
[234:53.97]Foo go home.
[234:58.98]I wanna see my daddy.
[235:03.30]I love you, Damon.
[235:05.48]I love you, Damon.
[235:07.62]I love you, Damon.
[235:10.93]I loved you too, Foo.
[235:12.85]Damon?
[235:14.45]Damon?
[235:15.87]Goodbye, Foo.
[235:17.51]Now fuck off!
[235:25.18]What the hell?
[235:29.46]That's too bad Aftis family's secret treasure So he's finally dead nice work Travis
[235:43.81]So this is what it was all about?
[235:46.87]Looks like my hunch was right.
[235:49.32]You... you're a friend of his, right?
[235:52.10]His friend?
[235:53.18]Are you kidding me?
[235:53.96]That crazy alien bastard was just a pawn.
[235:57.72]I'm the real king!
[235:59.54]Uh oh.
[236:33.55]TSA lore.
[236:34.43]Alright, we hit him, we punched him in the face and Travis strikes again and he came back and he got super alien mutant powers.
[236:47.16]Now we're gonna get a go-go Power Rangers sequence.
[236:50.36]Nobody told me about this.
[236:52.34]What the fuck is happening?
[236:54.77]Hey, that Glastonbury thing!
[236:56.77]Call it!
[236:57.71]That's been decommissioned!
[236:59.03]Too much dark matter!
[237:00.39]It deteriorated!
[237:01.91]Okay, then.
[237:02.91]What the hell do we do now?
[237:04.37]Juvenile, please do something about this!
[237:07.76]I cannot do anything right away.
[237:10.14]If I had around two years, I could help.
[237:12.82]That's not gonna work.
[237:14.52]No more heroes?
[237:16.58]The death gauge is going off.
[237:18.70]It is transferring something over from another dimension.
[237:22.60]Transferring?
[237:23.72]Transferring what?
[237:24.96]Some sort of unknown huge object.
[237:29.94]Starting countdown.
[237:31.16]It's not a monster or something, is it?
[237:32.84]We get one more monster or demon or whatever, and this town is screwed.
[237:37.40]Yeah, more like this planet.
[237:39.32]Three, two, one.
[237:42.97]Here it comes.
[237:44.81]In a second, the transfer is complete.
[237:48.23]An Arsenal roll-off model has arrived.
[237:50.42]What is this?
[237:51.68]The mech from Damon X. Makina?
[237:54.10]From the Japanese publisher Marvelous?
[237:56.26]An Arsenal?
[237:57.84]And it's the roll-off model.
[237:59.46]The model with the same coloring system as the Glastonbury.
[238:02.30]Travis, hurry up.
[238:03.73]Use it.
[238:05.53]I got no idea what the hell I'm doing.
[238:07.87]Is it a crossover?
[238:08.57]Oh my god.
[238:08.83]Was this whole game a shitpost?
[238:11.17]Probably, yeah.
[238:12.61]It was.
[238:12.83]The entire game.
[238:13.89]What?
[238:44.49]This thing is huge.
[238:57.57]It's the credits.
[239:01.55]Oh, it is the credits.
[239:13.02]It's the credit sequence.
[239:14.69]Okay.
[239:26.68]It's the quick time event credits.
[239:30.28]What if I fail?
[239:31.19]What happens?
[239:43.29]He's what I stabbed him in the chest Oh, I okay that was interesting Where the hell are we?
[240:10.29]Oh my god.
[240:40.00]I thought... It's a Smash Brothers reference?
[240:41.98]Are you fucking kidding me?
[241:04.39]Are you serious?
[241:05.89]He didn't get him to smash, brother, so they made their own end of... Oh my god, this is glorious.
[241:13.47]Hold on.
[241:13.99]Do I have all my moves still?
[241:24.64]Knock him off the stage.
[241:25.48]Let's go.
[241:27.26]Oh, you shipped me full armor mode.
[241:28.86]Let's go.
[241:29.12]Do I have it?
[241:35.60]Where is he?
[241:38.88]Oh, that did a shitload of final smash after that.
[241:49.15]Ravus confirms the smash.
[241:56.45]This game is fucked.
[241:58.22]This game is just like, I don't even, how do I even, how do you even give this game a rating?
[242:04.62]I don't want to die.
[242:06.52]I don't want to die.
[242:07.28]I don't want to die.
[242:09.32]I don't want to die.
[242:11.36]I don't want to die.
[242:15.31]I've still got somewhere to go home to.
[242:17.97]But you, you don't.
[242:20.09]I don't want to die.
[242:32.03]Be sure to apologize to Juvenal and have fun hanging out with Prince Dickhead in hell.
[242:45.70]I'll be honest.
[242:46.26]They're not making another one of these.
[242:52.50]How?
[242:53.22]How would you make another one?
[242:57.83]This is the shotgun blast of all video game genres and all No More Heroes lore.
[243:03.73]How do you even do another one of these?
[243:07.05]Suda said this was the last one.
[243:17.90]You can't have another one.
[243:34.74]Yeah, that was hilarious.
[243:38.18]You end the game on a Smash Brothers joke.
[243:48.67]Even the final boss fight was a joke.
[243:52.43]Yeah, this is way different than the other games.
[243:54.67]The other games were jokes, in quotes, and jokey and weird.
[243:58.92]But like somebody said, this entire game is a shitpost.
[244:03.51]Like, I just, like, blinked and I was in my bed reading, like, our shitpost.
[244:07.34]Like, whatever the top post was.
[244:08.38]Yeah, there's definitely an after-credits scene.
[244:22.79]I'm not going anywhere.
[244:38.74]It's kind of sad in a way.
[244:40.60]Because, I don't know, I like this character and I like this universe.
[244:43.84]It's funny.
[244:45.36]Interesting.
[244:47.50]I mean, the gameplay might be pretty similar to a lot of stuff that, you know, a third person sword fighting action game where you dodge, you dodge enemies.
[244:56.67]I love this concept.
[244:59.63]It's really cool.
[245:03.25]I hope this is really not the end of Travis Touchdown.
[245:06.55]I would play another one of these.
[245:07.47]You know, it doesn't have to be immediate, right?
[245:10.65]Even if it was just like an action game and you just did like another one of these.
[245:13.22]I don't know.
[245:13.64]It's sad to see it go.
[245:16.68]But it was great.
[245:17.68]Alright, shh.
[245:32.25]Nice place for the home run king, huh?
[245:35.51]Workin' hoe, buddy.
[245:37.61]Fuckin' dyin' on me like that.
[245:41.49]Daddy, I was never able to say this, but you always looked so cool hitting home runs.
[245:49.19]You always bought me marble fudge ice cream after your games.
[245:53.43]I actually wanted coffee flavor, but you always assumed that a little kid would want marble, so I never said anything.
[246:02.35]TSA Skipper feels nothing here.
[246:20.72]Good night, Daddy.
[246:22.62]My own no more hero.
[246:37.26]I wonder if the game keeps going.
[246:40.16]Because I got money at the end.
[246:41.26]Is there another after after credits scene?
[247:01.87]There's completionist stuff.
[247:03.05]Yeah, I imagine there's t-shirts and collectibles and other fights probably on mock.
[247:16.82]Still gonna get to level 50 in WarioWare?
[247:18.50]I'm gonna try, maybe.
[247:19.74]Gotta warm up to it, though.
[247:21.60]Yeah, it's been four hours.
[247:28.95]I'm not done.
[247:33.43]I planned on at least spending like an hour or two in WarioWare.
[247:36.13]Let's see how it goes.
[247:41.44]I don't have to go far.
[247:42.36]It's just the menu and then second tile.
[247:46.00]But I am going to go pee though.
[247:46.80]I'm going to take one more break.
[247:48.82]And I'm going to come back.
[247:49.78]But after the credits.
[247:50.84]I'm going to see what happens.
[247:54.00]Does this game meet your expectations?
[247:56.68]I don't think it could have met any expectations.
[248:01.31]Because the game was so outrageous and just unlike anything that I thought was ever going to happen with the game.
[248:07.17]That I don't... Like I said, I can't even give this game a rating.
[248:16.83]I would say it's definitely worth playing, and it's definitely probably the most fun and interesting of the three.
[248:26.74]I think the first game is a better video game, but I think this is a better experience.
[248:44.97]Worth playing out of 10.
[248:45.87]Yeah, that means at least it sits somewhere in the 7 to 8, 7 to 9 area.
[248:49.01]It was great.
[248:49.75]I loved it.
[248:50.51]You said it was a 9.8 on the first stream.
[249:01.44]No, I said 9.4.
[249:09.22]I didn't say 9.8.
[249:19.51]This game feels more like a novelty.
[249:21.30]Yeah, it was almost, it was almost a big toy.
[249:23.40]If that makes any sense.
[249:29.20]It was a big, watchable, cartoon toy that I could watch and play.
[249:35.04]Which is just a video game.
[249:37.90]No.
[249:38.74]I just described what a video game was.
[249:40.64]Is.
[249:40.96]Okay.
[249:45.08]That's stupid.
[249:50.10]Yeah, it's this digital, uh, digital toy where you see and watch what's happening on the screen and you control stuff.
[249:57.55]Yeah, like a big digital toy.
[249:59.99]A video game.
[250:10.96]It was basically the Paw Patrol movie.
[250:17.49]Give it a number.
[250:19.35]I can't.
[250:20.60]I love this song though.
[250:21.80]This song is like a 9 out of 10.
[250:43.96]um I don't know because it it changed directions seven or eight different times each one of the boss fights was its own sort of encapsulated joke that was taken away from the rest of the game so I don't know it's hard to even tell us tell you what this was
[251:20.69]Alright, let's see what we got.
[251:23.43]Yeah, the only thing I can tell you is I really liked it.
[251:27.38]It was very good.
[251:28.60]I very much enjoyed the whole time here.
[251:30.10]Alright, here we go.
[251:54.60]Okay.
[251:57.96]I am King Just Baptiste the Fifth.
[252:03.57]I've come to this world as a divine messenger.
[252:07.13]Foo's dad, huh?
[252:09.31]Well, someone kills your kid.
[252:12.09]I guess you're gonna get mad.
[252:13.59]Hold up now.
[252:15.01]Do not jump to conclusions.
[252:17.95]I have traveled vast distances to come to this planet, Earthling, to enter into a peace accord.
[252:25.86]Representative, Earthlings?
[252:28.22]Do I fucking look like it?
[252:30.58]In that case, it would appear that peace negotiations have failed.
[252:35.07]W-w-what?
[252:35.85]Wait a second!
[252:37.37]First you gotta talk with some actual representatives, and then... Under Baptiste interplanetary law, I hereby seize the planet, Earthling.
[252:48.44]Do it!
[253:06.77]Who the hell are you dad?
[253:13.18]It's me
[253:14.55]Have you forgotten what your own kids look like?
[253:16.80]What a shitty dad.
[253:18.34]Hunter and Jean?
[253:20.56]Is that you?
[253:21.14]Who?
[253:22.54]Master's children.
[253:23.76]The twins.
[253:24.82]Wow, you guys have gotten big.
[253:26.78]They're from another world.
[253:28.90]Wait a second.
[253:30.20]Hunter and Jean?
[253:31.88]Is it really... you?
[253:34.38]We came from the future.
[253:36.16]There's no time to explain.
[253:37.56]Just look at the situation.
[253:41.66]Mommy, I took out every single one of them.
[253:44.74]Good boy, Scott.
[253:46.16]Dad, let me introduce you guys.
[253:48.43]This is Gene's son, Scott.
[253:50.43]He's your grandson.
[253:52.53]I didn't mean to hide it, but getting to fight you, I was so happy.
[253:59.26]You're so tough, Grandpa.
[254:01.72]hold up this is like the actual final for reals ending what the hell is going on somebody explain this to me it feels like one of those like quick history videos is not over yet your next opponent is up to the north you came from the future to kill uncle Henry
[254:21.66]That cosplaying dickhead killed you and is counting down to this planet's destruction?
[254:26.30]Oh, snap!
[254:27.74]My great uncle teamed up with some super messed up aliens and was attempting to conquer the planet.
[254:33.91]So we have to change the future.
[254:36.35]Come with us!
[254:37.57]Come with us, otherwise you're gonna die.
[254:40.73]Oh, snap!
[254:42.19]Welcome, Travis, to the Garden of Insanity.
[254:47.04]Next stop, Family War.
[254:53.31]Alright, Suda, you wanna know how you make No More Heroes 4 and you make it funny and fun and you can do another one?
[254:57.80]Make it a party game.
[254:59.88]Just make it a four-player, like, Mario Party game.
[255:02.80]That's how you do it.
[255:10.99]Perfect.
[255:16.60]I would love a No More Heroes universe.
[255:20.06]No More Heroes 4-esque.
[255:22.63]Just jokey party game.
[255:24.17]And you can throw all this crazy lore in there.
[255:25.91]You can do all kinds of weird shit.
[255:31.91]Suda said if he does continue it, it would be in like 10 years.
[255:34.55]Oh, so like this one.
[255:38.98]Every 10 years, he just gets the itch to be insane.
[255:44.40]Which I can respect.
[255:46.22]I respect it.
[255:46.70]Alright, there's the higher difficulty.
[255:51.22]I want to see the shirt.
[255:53.90]Ooh.
[256:00.01]Every 10 years, he does acid.
[256:04.43]Alright, let's see.
[256:07.77]Alright, so we have some new clothes here.
[256:14.45]Ooh, I like that purple.
[256:25.78]No More Heroes 2, yep.
[256:29.08]Is the original.
[256:35.57]What about shirts?
[256:39.15]I gotta get the jacket off.
[256:51.04]There he is.
[256:56.94]Death man.
[256:58.94]Uniform of Dia.
[257:00.06]Burger.
[257:00.46]Burger suplex.
[257:01.26]Yep, that's the one I want.
[257:07.68]That's cool.
[257:09.46]Alright, that was really cool.
[257:11.04]New game plus, you can make the game really hard.
[257:13.38]Let me just take a look and see what it looks like.
[257:21.17]I would wear the Baptist shirt.
[257:24.73]I would love a Fu shirt.
[257:26.97]It's just him pointing like a lightning bolt into the camera.
[257:30.29]You know what I mean?
[257:36.14]That was cool.
[257:38.36]I love the concept too.
[257:39.58]Okay, you know when a concept really just grabs you and it's really interesting?
[257:44.00]I love the... the alien that lands with the rocket ship and they did that little intro.
[257:49.52]It turns out he comes back 20 years later and he's just like, oh, I'm coming to take the fucking planet over.
[257:53.76]That's cool.
[257:54.72]It's, you know, it fits in a trope somewhere, but whatever.
[257:57.59]I think it's cool.
[257:58.17]I liked it a lot.
[258:03.45]Speedrun the game on Carolina Reaper.
[258:12.28]Yeah, because how do you do a No More Heroes 3?
[258:14.16]You just make it aliens and you make it superheroes and shit.
[258:16.56]That's... It was great.
[258:19.04]Two thumbs way up.
[258:20.84]Very good.
[258:21.30]Now, hold on a minute.
[258:29.00]Forbidden area.
[258:31.82]Does this ever... Did this ever open up?
[258:36.33]I already beat it, right?
[258:37.37]I already did it?
[258:37.77]I don't know.
[258:40.09]Alright.
[258:40.71]Let's move to WarioWare.
[258:41.57]I'm gonna pee.
[258:44.59]It's DLC.
[258:47.43]I didn't even think about that.
[258:48.56]Maybe there will be DLC.
[258:54.54]Huh.
[258:55.60]They were just cut from the game?
[258:56.86]I wonder if there'll be DLC.
[258:58.88]Probably not, though.
[259:01.55]Well, if it's there, I'll play it.
[259:02.63]DSA had three DLCs.
[259:06.45]Oh, shit.
[259:06.91]Alright.
[259:07.25]Well, maybe we'll play it.
[259:12.75]Alright, I am going to go pee.
[259:14.59]I'll be right back.
[259:15.66]We're going to open up WarioWare for like an hour or so.
[259:18.16]And I'll play a little bit more.
[259:19.14]I'll be right back.
