[00:37.66]Hey.
[00:38.35]Hey, we're live.
[00:41.91]We are live right now.
[00:43.75]I promise you.
[00:45.39]I pressed the button.
[00:48.37]So, give me a second.
[00:49.71]I gotta make a tweet.
[00:50.97]My phone is dead.
[00:52.75]Upstairs.
[00:54.33]So, you're gonna have to give me a minute.
[00:55.81]The stream is gonna be in orbit soon.
[00:57.33]We'll talk about E3.
[00:59.47]Just give me one second.
[01:00.67]Everybody calm down.
[01:01.83]There's no reason to fray.
[01:03.29]There's no reason to fray.
[01:06.36]Gimme like another two and a half minutes.
[01:08.48]I'll be right back.
[03:43.19]Okay.
[03:45.57]I'm so scared.
[03:46.45]Why are you scared?
[03:47.59]You don't have to be so scared.
[03:48.66]Tonight, we're going to be playing Little Nightmares.
[03:53.16]I just got back from E3.
[03:54.20]Employee, my arm's tired.
[03:55.24]You know what I mean?
[03:57.68]Oh, look, I fucked up that.
[03:58.62]It's, uh... Yo, I... Hey, everybody.
[04:01.28]Just flew in from, uh... Just flew in from Los Angeles.
[04:05.33]I could use some sleep.
[04:06.93]No, um... I just...
[04:09.57]Hey, I just... Tired.
[04:11.10]Got it.
[04:11.68]Alright.
[04:12.50]What is that noise?
[04:15.76]Hi.
[04:16.08]Uh, the cat apparently is, like, in here.
[04:18.60]I'm getting, like, hissed at.
[04:19.64]What's going on?
[04:20.28]Hey!
[04:20.86]Alright, you wanna, like, get... Alright, I didn't know, like, the cat was in here.
[04:26.30]Go on.
[04:26.98]Go out the door.
[04:28.98]This way.
[04:30.56]Go on.
[04:30.94]Go.
[04:31.36]I didn't even, like, do anything.
[04:40.09]I literally turned around and I heard like... Okay, so.
[04:44.73]It's plugged in.
[04:47.02]I'm going to have to wait to do a tweet, you know what I mean?
[04:51.23]Cat is snake.
[04:53.01]I know.
[04:54.47]Snake was having like fucking 60 children in my world.
[04:57.21]Alright, let's switch over.
[04:57.95]I'm going to have to make a tweet later.
[04:59.67]We're going to be playing Little Nightmares.
[05:03.86]I don't know very much about this game.
[05:06.76]It was just... Is that a good temperature?
[05:09.50]What do you guys think?
[05:10.18]Is that a good temperature for you guys?
[05:12.76]And by temperature, I hope you know I mean like sound.
[05:16.30]Hold on.
[05:18.64]Turn it down a little and then turn it up for you guys.
[05:20.62]That's probably better.
[05:24.18]How's that water?
[05:24.76]Is that water okay for you guys?
[05:27.60]Let me get my stream thing here.
[05:31.16]Oh, I hate when I do this.
[05:33.00]Alright, scary game.
[05:36.17]Is it a scary game?
[05:38.79]I heard it was a little interesting, but we'll talk E3 for the few seconds that I have.
[05:43.74]Uh, who cares?
[05:44.28]E3 was dumb.
[05:45.50]Like, E3 sucks.
[05:46.90]It was like two games that were even worth talking about.
[05:48.95]And that's the new Lord of the Rings game.
[05:50.57]That's the new Shadow of War game.
[05:52.57]And Cuphead.
[05:53.27]Who cares about anything else?
[05:55.51]Like, really, who cares?
[05:56.65]You know, actually, who had the best booth was Mattel, actually.
[06:00.63]I got an opportunity to check out Mattel.
[06:03.91]They have a lot of cool new Cars 3 merchandise and video games coming out.
[06:08.93]I got a pretty good picture of the Mattel booth.
[06:11.31]I'm going to be tweeting that out later.
[06:12.91]Mattel was probably best in show.
[06:16.95]That's true, Monster Hunter: World, right?
[06:19.75]That's cool.
[06:24.21]Alright, new game.
[06:26.19]Empty, empty, empty, just like my song.
[06:32.55]It was probably a cutscene, but everybody calm down.
[06:49.84]So Shadow... So here's the thing about Monolith, right?
[06:53.70]They may... Oh, I'm sorry.
[06:54.60]Hold on.
[06:54.84]I'll wait.
[06:55.12]I was just laughing at the cutscene.
[06:56.46]Hold on.
[07:12.29]Ooh.
[07:13.95]Oh, this is the new South Park game.
[07:16.59]You play as Kenny.
[07:17.98]Kenny's brother.
[07:19.96]Carl.
[07:22.06]This is so cool.
[07:22.96]The Stick of Truth 2.
[07:23.86]Okay.
[07:28.90]Let's get the buttons down here.
[07:29.90]We live in a suitcase.
[07:30.74]That's cool.
[07:33.40]Alright, let's just go this way.
[07:36.28]Just get rained on for a second.
[07:37.52]Alright.
[07:41.69]I'm knocking over cans.
[07:46.75]My game's kind of running like shit, but I'm not going to complain about it.
[07:50.06]Even though I just did.
[07:55.20]I don't think I get a tutorial.
[07:58.28]I think there's...
[08:01.46]I gotta light this place up.
[08:03.24]I get it.
[08:04.42]I just guessed on how to do that, so I figured it out.
[08:09.56]Oh, okay, so I have a lighter.
[08:12.58]Alright, well.
[08:18.41]Uh... Is there something I can light back here?
[08:24.43]Heat up some of these soup cans?
[08:29.47]Did the water move?
[08:30.11]Okay, I guess...
[08:34.76]This is a very spooky game.
[08:36.68]What's crouch?
[08:38.08]It has to be a crouch.
[08:39.22]Okay, there's crouch.
[08:42.06]Where's the tutorial?
[08:43.26]What's going on here?
[08:43.94]Tell me how to do these buttons.
[08:49.16]Where's the tutorial?
[08:50.72]Where's the tutorial?
[08:51.92]Okay, so let that... I guess I can just go in here.
[09:01.27]Okay.
[09:01.71]Well, that's a bad idea.
[09:02.81]This might be gas in here.
[09:10.13]Okay.
[09:11.71]Watch out.
[09:12.15]Don't drop that.
[09:12.88]Don't drop that in the lighter fluid that's in these vents.
[09:14.74]Alright.
[09:19.34]I can go up.
[09:20.08]Can I like wall jump?
[09:21.50]Can I do like a Super Mario?
[09:25.94]I did that as a joke because I fucking make a Mario reference every stream.
[09:29.52]Don't worry about it.
[09:30.20]You're going to be fine.
[09:32.70]Here comes the first monster.
[09:33.62]I can already tell.
[09:34.26]It's going to open up the door and it's going to be a big daddy.
[09:41.65]Alright, you can do that.
[09:49.20]Where am I?
[09:49.68]Okay, that's fine.
[09:50.66]I just wanted to see if it was possible.
[09:51.92]I wanted to see, like, what happened.
[09:53.44]And we all knew it was going to happen.
[09:54.62]We're fine.
[09:57.64]Up the stairs.
[09:58.18]Here comes the first... That's actually kind of cool.
[10:00.76]I'm going to take a second to figure this out.
[10:04.25]What a fucking puzzle.
[10:06.41]Oh, you had to go up the stairs.
[10:07.59]How to find a puzzle.
[10:10.75]um can I grab this okay I can like I can pull it I don't think I can move it though no not really okay weird figure over here person I grab okay I can pick this up can't use my lighter at the same time come on where's your strength kid
[10:42.48]I don't know why I'm carrying this.
[10:43.92]There has to be a reason.
[10:46.18]Is this gonna be, like, mousetrap?
[10:47.24]Do I put this inside of here?
[10:49.10]Oh, fuck.
[10:52.64]I don't think I was... Maybe I was... I don't know.
[10:54.50]Maybe I was supposed to do that.
[11:00.54]Another bed.
[11:01.28]A bowl.
[11:04.27]Is this inside?
[11:05.09]No, this is called Little Nightmares.
[11:10.91]Come on.
[11:11.99]No more jumping on the bed.
[11:13.19]What's that song?
[11:18.63]Bad ending.
[11:21.21]Holy shit.
[11:22.69]What is that?
[11:25.45]There's a guy hanging there?
[11:27.65]Okay.
[11:30.61]Get him to move.
[11:31.25]Just you watch.
[11:33.39]Get a little fire under his feet.
[11:36.43]Can I pick this up?
[11:42.04]What if I held this here for a second?
[11:43.36]He was just like, oh, oh, oh!
[11:44.31]He's moving his feet up and down.
[11:45.43]Alright, well, let... I'm just gonna move this out of the way.
[11:51.33]I think this is what I have to do.
[11:52.70]There's like a letter on the ground over this is.
[11:58.38]Can't, like, pull this open.
[12:05.63]Uh, this cannot be moved.
[12:08.39]The chair can be pulled over here, though.
[12:10.33]I'm intelligent.
[12:11.33]I know these things.
[12:18.51]No, he's fine.
[12:19.03]He's just, like, in the attic.
[12:22.03]I'm gonna end up going up the stairs and walking into his head or something.
[12:25.03]Okay, I'm actually starting to get a little frightened.
[12:31.43]Not that much, though.
[12:32.25]I'm a big boy.
[12:37.32]That person's hand's in there.
[12:38.48]It's gonna pop out.
[12:44.04]Come on, open the fridge.
[12:45.00]Here it goes.
[12:50.54]Do I do anything in here?
[12:51.78]Is that dad's shoes in there again?
[12:53.16]Okay.
[12:55.48]Somebody's shoes.
[12:58.89]I can... No.
[13:00.43]Can I go that way?
[13:01.01]I can, but what's over here?
[13:03.35]Yeah.
[13:08.53]Where am I?
[13:09.77]What's going on?
[13:14.84]Well, whatever.
[13:15.34]I feel like this is just a fairly linear experience until we get a little further on.
[13:23.28]Close the fridge.
[13:24.98]No.
[13:29.53]These people get scared.
[13:31.75]So these people like the... Yeah, well, you're apparently coming with me.
[13:40.68]Are you coming with me?
[13:43.80]Yeah, if you pick them up, they walk around with you.
[13:49.28]Alright.
[13:52.00]So I need to take him this way?
[13:55.90]Maybe the other way, back into the fridge.
[13:57.96]Should I put this guy in the fridge?
[14:04.81]I have no idea.
[14:05.71]We'll just go this way for a second.
[14:12.44]I'll just put him in the way.
[14:13.78]Come here.
[14:18.02]Will you follow me back this way?
[14:19.28]I hope so.
[14:20.52]No?
[14:22.51]Come on.
[14:26.51]Yeah.
[14:30.03]I don't think there's anything over here.
[14:31.15]I think I just have to keep going.
[14:34.58]Close the fridge door.
[14:39.50]Is there anything of value over here?
[14:42.48]What is that?
[14:44.24]God.
[14:45.98]Come here.
[14:46.36]Close.
[14:50.26]Close.
[14:55.73]Climb the fridge.
[14:56.57]I just tried to do that and it didn't work.
[14:59.65]I was trying to climb up the fridge and it wouldn't let me.
[15:01.37]Oh, please.
[15:03.99]I don't believe that for a second.
[15:05.80]I tried to do that earlier.
[15:10.62]Who has a fridge like that, by the way?
[15:12.03]You have like fucking 12 shelves in your fridge?
[15:13.99]Nobody does.
[15:14.59]Sorry.
[15:16.07]And now there's a mucus monster.
[15:21.51]Whoever has that fridge, all you can put in there is soda cans.
[15:26.04]There's no room for a turkey in there.
[15:27.40]There we go.
[15:36.70]Okie dokie.
[15:38.02]I probably have to touch this.
[15:43.39]That opens that.
[15:46.39]Light this because we have to light all the oil drums.
[15:50.21]I believe that's a save point.
[15:52.15]If I were to take a wild guess.
[15:55.99]Alright, this one's going to be tricky.
[15:56.99]We've got two upside down question mark slug monsters and a jump.
[16:02.57]Let's get it.
[16:05.39]Never mind.
[16:05.77]That was really easy.
[16:08.54]Let's look at the Harry Potter newspaper and see Sirius Black screaming.
[16:12.40]Nice.
[16:13.70]Let's see the whole thing about Dumbledore gives Harry Potter the goblet.
[16:18.54]Nice.
[16:18.82]I've seen those movies.
[16:21.57]Let me climb this.
[16:25.43]No, we don't.
[16:26.11]Do we climb this?
[16:31.47]Do I pull on this?
[16:34.79]What's that?
[16:35.15]Can I burn this?
[16:39.26]I can pull it off.
[16:42.56]That was a pretty funny joke.
[16:43.46]Thanks!
[16:44.38]Hey, by the way, while I hang here, CookieCRM, thanks for the ten bucks.
[16:48.92]Yo, GermBro, love you to bits.
[16:52.39]Oh, thank you, Cookie, for the ten dollars.
[16:53.85]MetalClaw, thanks for the bits.
[16:55.59]Here's a good one-fifth the money needed to buy a 24-count of Pepto-Bismol at Walmart or something.
[16:59.87]Well, thanks.
[17:01.32]Machete Mario, thanks for the bits.
[17:02.48]Welcome back, Dad.
[17:03.30]Welcome back, son.
[17:05.26]Ghoul Champ, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[17:06.94]They just say cheer 1,000.
[17:08.11]And there was one more person.
[17:11.61]Give me a sec.
[17:12.47]Oh, God, I think I just crashed the game.
[17:16.69]Jen Betters, thanks for the bits for $200.
[17:19.23]200 bits.
[17:21.27]And Super Hot Berry.
[17:23.33]Super Bradberry.
[17:25.54]Did I break it?
[17:26.10]Did I break the game?
[17:26.66]Are we good?
[17:27.56]Yeah, we're good.
[17:27.92]Okay.
[17:30.92]Thank you guys for your... for your bits.
[17:34.49]Much appreciated.
[17:35.01]$200?
[17:36.37]Yeah.
[17:36.91]Alright, climb in here.
[17:44.58]How is this a... Alright, let me ask something.
[17:47.24]Let me ask you guys something.
[17:48.06]How is this Little Nightmares?
[17:50.26]When... Just walking around like an old addict.
[17:54.76]Okay, that's what I was talking about.
[17:56.57]Where are the nightmares?
[17:59.84]Are we at the first nightmare?
[18:00.82]Uh-oh.
[18:05.75]Uh-oh.
[18:07.69]I talked a bunch of shit.
[18:11.59]And look at that.
[18:13.51]People tell me I'm not a fucking grade A gamer when I do shit like that.
[18:21.42]Put it around, run, take it out, run.
[18:24.83]Jump this way.
[18:25.99]Bait him that way.
[18:27.59]Over here.
[18:28.53]Drop it.
[18:29.61]Open door.
[18:37.70]That's me.
[18:38.56]The great A-gamer.
[18:42.36]Nightmare?
[18:42.74]I don't see it.
[18:44.10]That was barely a nightmare.
[18:49.15]Light the fucking thing.
[18:49.91]What are you doing?
[18:54.44]I got my gamer license revoked from Dark Souls.
[18:56.88]That's not fair.
[18:59.82]That's not fair.
[19:00.70]I disagree.
[19:03.60]Beating Dark Souls 3 on stream is the equivalent of getting your Mack truck license.
[19:09.32]Not everybody is going to get a Mack truck license.
[19:11.08]You know how fucking hard it is to drive a Mack truck?
[19:13.66]I'm talking an 18-wheeler.
[19:14.96]That's not easy to do.
[19:16.96]So, I have my regular car license.
[19:23.26]You know?
[19:24.52]Getting a Mack truck license is a little more difficult, and I've had it.
[19:28.52]I still have it.
[19:33.80]I still have that license, so... Jump into the bucket.
[19:39.09]Nah.
[19:42.51]Wait.
[19:43.13]Okay.
[19:49.52]I'm going to just cut up the middle man.
[19:50.64]That's the speedrun strategy.
[19:52.08]I almost just jumped off.
[19:54.90]Almost.
[19:55.34]That's the key word, right?
[19:57.28]That is the key word.
[19:58.20]What's over here?
[19:58.84]Some kind of door?
[20:02.80]I'm looking for monsters.
[20:05.76]The atmosphere of this game is pretty cool, but where are the monsters?
[20:11.46]I have such a low attention span, I require huge monsters.
[20:16.96]If I don't see one in the next 30 minutes... It's gonna... Of course it's gonna do that.
[20:24.00]Okay.
[20:24.88]Here we go.
[20:25.34]1, 2, 3, go.
[20:26.44]No.
[20:27.40]Put it up.
[20:29.02]No, don't close the door, you fucking dummy.
[20:33.14]So where is this?
[20:33.90]Hold... Made it!
[20:41.93]I actually got a prompt this time.
[20:45.17]Can I open this?
[20:46.09]What's in there?
[20:49.75]No, just a fucking rat person.
[20:51.71]Should I be chasing these guys or something?
[20:53.15]I don't understand.
[20:53.91]Whatever.
[21:00.35]Anything else?
[21:02.97]No, but E3 was fun.
[21:04.49]I just got back yesterday.
[21:05.73]Spent a couple extra days in California.
[21:10.03]It's a great place.
[21:10.97]I love it out there.
[21:13.52]In fact, like, eventually, I think over the next couple of years, ow, my fucking kneecaps.
[21:19.08]I might want to, like, live out there.
[21:21.45]I don't know.
[21:22.99]I really like it out there, though.
[21:27.29]Monster?
[21:30.03]I think so.
[21:31.21]Yup.
[21:36.26]Let's get up there.
[21:37.44]Let's get up there and see the monster.
[21:41.11]California is expensive.
[21:42.63]Didn't vlog or anything.
[21:43.53]No, I don't really vlog anymore.
[21:47.27]Not really.
[21:48.37]Not usually.
[21:48.99]So what's in here?
[21:54.67]A couple of rats.
[21:58.27]Can I catch the rat?
[22:00.37]No.
[22:03.73]Vacation vlog.
[22:04.91]MIA.
[22:07.29]I can't get in the trash.
[22:09.20]Can I burn the toilet paper?
[22:14.76]go to Washington?
[22:17.62]I don't know.
[22:18.12]I kind of want to live somewhere.
[22:21.23]I want to go somewhere.
[22:22.29]I mean, obviously, that's how you get that.
[22:30.15]You can move this, right?
[22:34.52]Have I played Limbo or Inside?
[22:35.82]I actually played Inside on stream from start to finish.
[22:39.23]And that was a fun, fun game.
[22:41.97]I enjoyed that one.
[22:43.37]That's only for a certain amount of time.
[22:45.33]What?
[22:46.95]Oh, it's electrified.
[22:47.69]I get it.
[22:51.93]Blocks.
[22:52.43]I'm going to have to do a seesaw thing here.
[22:54.51]I'm going to launch stuff in the air, I'm assuming.
[23:01.31]What's this?
[23:05.53]Um...
[23:09.30]What's the point of this?
[23:10.90]Let me just look.
[23:14.38]So I get onto the shelf.
[23:16.72]But, like, who cares?
[23:20.40]Why does that even matter?
[23:23.60]Intelligent streamer.
[23:24.62]Watch out, guys.
[23:25.40]I know.
[23:25.82]I told you.
[23:26.26]Did I knock something off?
[23:33.41]Um... Well, let's just try that again.
[23:42.32]Try not to get too spooked.
[23:44.58]I'll try.
[23:44.96]What am I supposed to be doing in this room?
[23:54.84]How big is this room?
[23:57.72]What the hell is this?
[24:01.12]Keep going?
[24:10.64]Alright, so... I just have to keep going.
[24:14.66]All that shit is... There's nothing in there means anything, by the way.
[24:17.74]I just got bug zapped.
[24:22.60]Very cool, okay.
[24:27.70]So I just have to... Look at all the weird swings and seesaws and stuff.
[24:35.93]Look, none of you guys know how to drive a truck, alright?
[24:37.81]I do.
[24:41.04]Oh, yeah?
[24:42.00]By a show of hands, people in this chat, how many of you guys know how to drive a standard?
[24:45.22]Hmm.
[24:45.54]I don't know how to drive a standard either, so... I'm with there.
[24:52.46]I'm with there with you guys.
[24:55.04]Alright, keep going.
[24:57.34]I guess that was just there for fun.
[25:00.20]What was the point of that?
[25:02.13]And what's with the Scooby-Doo doors?
[25:06.63]Can any of these be opened?
[25:08.03]I don't think so.
[25:15.58]I'm getting tired.
[25:16.24]Oh, there's the Eye of Sauron!
[25:23.32]I died.
[25:23.64]Alright.
[25:34.93]I've never driven a car.
[25:37.63]When the ice iron opens up, Kristen McCormack, Kenny McCormack's sister that wears the yellow, freezes.
[25:45.51]Oh my god, they killed Kristen.
[25:46.89]You bastards!
[25:50.09]No fucking streamer or YouTuber has made that joke.
[25:52.85]Only me.
[25:53.53]Don't forget it.
[25:54.17]Okay, now we go.
[25:56.87]Hide behind the dirty bed.
[25:57.91]Okay, go.

[27:14.40]I just get out of the shower with a towel on.
[27:20.51]I'm sitting there to accept my Emmy.
[27:22.49]And I just got out of the shower and I still have a towel around my waist.
[27:27.73]Hey, I'd like to thank everybody that made this possible.

[29:47.75]Okay.
[29:50.89]Okay.
[29:55.51]You know what?
[29:56.23]Fuck going on an airplane.
[29:57.19]Can I say that?
[29:58.03]Like, every time I go on an airplane, like, every one of my devices changes.
[30:03.13]You know, you like, you turn on, like, an airplane mode, you're like, disable Bluetooth, and just to get on a fucking plane.
[30:09.53]And then, like, I sit back down here, and I'm, like, wondering why I'm at, like, 1x right now.
[30:13.72]Like, what the hell happened?
[30:16.84]I don't think anything over there was important, so whatever, let's just go.
[30:24.16]You know when you go on a ferris wheel?
[30:29.06]I can open this, I think.
[30:31.95]No, I can't.
[30:33.55]Am I beating this game on stream, by the way?
[30:34.99]Is this one of those games that takes like two hours to play?
[30:39.62]Oh, there's a monster.
[30:40.26]There's a monster.
[30:40.70]We got our first monster.
[30:43.10]Hide under the bed.
[30:43.68]Okay.
[30:45.08]Okay.
[30:55.84]This guy's fucking freaking me out.
[30:58.48]I love how I have a lighter right now.
[30:59.92]It's like he can't see the lighter.
[31:03.72]I wonder where that lighter is under the bed.
[31:05.86]This is where I have to rescue all the kids, right?
[31:10.64]Come on, I gotta rescue the kids.
[31:13.54]That's what this game's about.
[31:14.34]It's about rescuing everybody.
[31:18.50]No, it's not.
[31:18.96]Just go.
[31:19.70]Don't make a fucking dumb stream joke.
[31:23.84]Everybody knows the joke you're trying to make and it's not going to work, so don't even make it.
[31:36.32]No.
[31:36.92]Wait.
[31:37.12]There's an Easter egg over here, I guarantee it.
[31:41.35]That's going to get this over so I can open the door.
[31:42.67]Come on.
[31:43.25]Give me the Easter egg.
[31:43.79]Come on.
[31:45.89]One of these boxes can be pulled.

[32:15.47]Hey, Surreal Electric, thanks for the $5.
[32:17.61]Jeremiah, I had a dream that a delivery guy was bringing giant boxes filled with knickknacks, a live horse, a suit of armor, and the Mona Lisa into your house, and you have no memory of buying these things.
[32:27.06]Well, I've done that before.
[32:28.52]That's a very, very real, literal dream you had.
[32:31.36]I've bought things on Amazon that show up, and I'm just like, what is this?
[32:35.00]And I throw it away because one of my other me's bought it, and I'm just like, I don't want this.
[32:41.72]And then the other me wakes up and goes, like, oh, where's that thing I bought?
[32:44.34]Cool!
[32:45.46]And can't find it.
[32:48.42]But, uh, thank you.
[32:49.20]That's surreal.
[32:51.71]Thank you for your five dollars.
[32:52.61]Also, no name Bob, thanks for the five bucks.
[32:54.95]Come to California, we can go on a play date.
[33:00.15]I mean, I do like to go on adventures.
[33:09.54]Well, I think we're just dropping.
[33:11.99]Yep.
[33:12.59]Rats.
[33:14.88]I can't wait for Rat Movie 3.
[33:17.52]It's gonna be fucking great.
[33:19.56]Why do I keep doing that?
[33:21.28]Oh, got a stomach ache.
[33:25.06]I think that really is what this is.
[33:26.72]I have, like, diarrhea.
[33:28.96]Oh, God.
[33:30.82]Don't put diarrhea in a game that I play.
[33:33.30]That's not a good idea.
[33:35.02]You're giving me material.
[33:37.46]No, don't give me material.
[33:42.04]They're giving me material.
[33:49.08]Oh, look.
[33:50.19]It's a guy I know.
[33:52.51]Guaranteed this guy has an English accent.
[33:55.27]You have to make it out of the darkness.
[33:57.91]Watch.
[33:58.13]Ready?
[34:01.93]Are you going to feed me?
[34:03.62]Oh, thanks for the big potato.
[34:10.90]Is that why I have to eat in this game?
[34:17.00]You have to find the exit!
[34:19.36]It's that way!
[34:23.22]And there's gonna be a little piano.
[34:25.23]Here comes the piano.
[34:27.35]Like the Tim Burton piano.
[34:29.41]You guys all know what that is.
[34:31.27]Remember, this is like a weird, goofy, scary, strange, like out of this world in quotes game.
[34:36.21]There better be like the far right end of a piano.
[34:41.87]Better be.
[34:47.76]What is that?
[34:48.92]What is this?
[34:51.90]What's this?
[34:53.64]Any more monsters?
[34:58.52]I can move this thing.
[35:03.16]Don't ask me why I'm doing this.
[35:06.06]I don't know.
[35:08.50]I have to get up there, I think.
[35:14.84]Playing Devil's Third?
[35:18.21]You're not actually asking me to play Devil's Third, are you?
[35:23.39]Why are you asking me to play Devil's Third?
[35:26.95]A game that I was told to stop playing, like, four times.
[35:35.26]We're gonna play Devil's Third.
[35:36.62]What the fuck?
[35:40.50]You guys don't know, I, like, smashed my Wii with a hammer after that.
[35:43.22]You don't understand.
[35:46.23]I was so frustrated at shit with the Wii and like trying to get it to work and like the whole like Elgato thing.
[35:50.39]I smashed my Wii with a hammer.
[36:00.18]Is this board joke still relevant?
[36:01.48]No, because I played it and it didn't work well.
[36:08.99]This takes a little while for this game to get going.
[36:11.01]You know what I mean?
[36:11.63]Alright, can I make this jump?
[36:17.73]I'm all the way up from downtown.
[36:18.85]I just broke my bones all so badly.
[36:35.25]My legs and my feet, just all my bones went up into my head.
[36:42.22]Stuck to landing.
[36:43.42]Oh, fuck.
[36:43.90]I have to do that again.
[36:44.62]We're not doing that again.
[36:47.14]Just get up there quick.
[36:48.77]Don't fuck around.
[36:50.87]Turn on facecam.
[36:51.85]Why?
[36:52.13]There's no reason to have a facecam on right now.
[36:55.09]Nothing, like, jumpy and scary is happening.
[36:56.87]It's just abnormal.
[37:01.03]It wasn't scary.
[37:02.39]It was just abnormal.
[37:04.11]Alright, five points to whoever knows what that is.
[37:10.41]You know, it wasn't scary.
[37:11.55]It was just abnormal.
[37:15.83]Ah, I love it.
[37:21.08]Yep, that is true.
[37:21.98]Somebody got it.
[37:22.50]I almost just didn't make that.
[37:25.90]I would have been very sad.
[37:29.95]Facecam or riot?
[37:31.19]Why would I turn a facecam on right now?
[37:32.91]There's no reason to turn it on.
[37:39.45]please make it hey pickled llama thank you for the 15 bucks and you just say cheer 1500 thank you thank you so much for the 15 bucks hope I hope it's worth it for you hope you're enjoying yourself hopefully I can entertain you as much as I can and if not then fuck me I mean fuck me
[38:05.25]I can't do anything with this.
[38:06.55]It's too powerful.
[38:08.43]That's going to turn that off down there.
[38:10.27]And I'm going to have to sprint.
[38:12.03]I can't do anything with all this.
[38:13.05]Oh, no.
[38:13.37]It's going to clicker.
[38:18.12]Okay.
[38:20.26]Should I do that again?
[38:23.80]No.
[38:24.54]I mean, I could go on the ladder.
[38:28.10]I don't even know why I tried that.
[38:35.97]God damn it.
[38:38.21]Don't start me- AHHHHHH!
[38:52.36]Oh, come on.
[38:53.63]What the fuck?
[38:55.33]I knew I just was trying to skip time.
[38:57.17]I was just trying to go faster because I'm getting bored.
[39:04.21]You guys know me.
[39:05.11]If I start to get bored, shit goes really wrong.
[39:10.16]I understand they're trying to build the atmosphere.
[39:11.76]I get it.
[39:13.34]And I'm... My stamp is not here yet.
[39:17.72]Oh, man.
[39:18.10]Now I'm irritated.
[39:21.45]Facecam, please.
[39:22.07]I want to see your handsome face.
[39:23.31]No, I don't have a good face today.
[39:27.06]I'm one of those people, I feel like I have a different face, like, every day.
[39:29.62]You guys feel like that?
[39:32.11]You look in the mirror, and you, like, see some guy's face, and you're like, oh, that kind of looks like me, I guess.
[39:40.65]And then the next day, you look in the mirror, and you're like, there's that guy, there's me, I know me.
[39:47.36]And then, like, the third day goes by, and you are just completely fucking different.
[39:53.84]No more of this.
[39:55.36]I need to go on the ladder, I think.
[39:56.56]Just climb down.
[39:57.28]Don't be an idiot.
[39:59.22]No, seriously.
[40:00.00]Don't... That sounds abnormal.
[40:07.31]Hey, thank you, RadicalCorky, for the $1.
[40:10.25]How was my vacation?
[40:11.01]My vacation was good.
[40:12.83]It was very nice.
[40:13.79]I love California.
[40:14.47]I think Jerma might be crazy.
[40:17.17]I don't think he is.
[40:17.85]He's just a little... He's just abnormal.
[40:23.18]So can I grab onto this from the ladder?
[40:33.33]Is there something I can do here?
[40:37.29]I don't think so.
[40:45.67]Can I move this thing now?
[40:50.37]Yeah, I love California.
[40:53.03]I swear to fucking God if I'm dead.
[40:55.45]I just... Just climb over.
[41:01.29]Just climb over it.
[41:02.35]I... Swear to God.
[41:07.48]Fucking climb over this.
[41:09.98]I just was on it.
[41:11.90]I was just on it.
[41:12.78]I'm getting angry.
[41:14.02]Please.
[41:16.12]Please, God.
[41:16.86]Thank you.
[41:20.96]Move it this way.
[41:26.14]Uh, now what?
[41:27.88]I... Oh, God.
[41:48.19]Okay, we're fine.
[41:50.67]No, we're not.
[41:51.65]Shit.
[41:52.15]I have to push the lever and then jump on it.
[41:56.47]Nice depth perception.
[41:57.51]I know.
[41:58.03]Seriously.
[41:58.53]I have to push it and then jump.
[42:04.78]This is going to be a real pain in the ass.
[42:06.20]Here we go.
[42:08.30]Just go like this.
[42:10.32]And go.
[42:13.74]I got it.
[42:14.22]That was very, very lucky.
[42:19.58]I almost didn't make that.
[42:23.94]Keep on moving.
[42:26.72]Hey, thank you.
[42:27.60]Oh, Baza.
[42:28.52]Baza Gaza.
[42:29.98]Baza Gaza.
[42:32.41]Ladies and gentlemen.
[42:34.87]Very, very cool dude.
[42:36.61]He makes YouTube videos.
[42:38.09]I just met him for the first time.
[42:40.13]I was also meeting you at E3.
[42:41.39]Despite the rumors, is it actually 6-5 at least?
[42:47.42]It's true.
[42:48.76]I didn't say that.
[42:49.36]He did.
[42:51.41]But it was a pleasure hanging out with you, dude.
[42:53.75]Thank you for giving me $20, by the way.
[42:55.80]I just gave you $20.
[42:59.88]He's a cool dude.
[43:01.14]I was viewing Muse Elk.
[43:03.40]I hung out with at E3.
[43:05.56]I saw a lot of people at E3.
[43:08.83]There were a lot of human beings at E3 that I ended up seeing and hanging out with.
[43:13.77]Some YouTubers, some not.
[43:16.79]Okay, I'm doing something wrong here.
[43:19.09]Can I, like, open this?
[43:21.64]That one can't be opened.
[43:22.40]What about this one?
[43:24.36]See, smart.
[43:25.60]See, I'm going to make a joke here.
[43:27.58]Get yourself ready for a joke because it's coming very soon.
[43:33.12]You know, I trust my tax attorney to lock my filing cabinets.
[43:37.98]You know what I was trying to go with that one.
[43:39.24]It didn't work out so well, but you know what I was trying to say.
[43:41.54]That was like a funny joke.
[43:43.18]It would have been.
[43:44.52]Bazzacazza, ladies and gentlemen, showed up into the chat.
[43:47.93]He's a cool dude.
[43:54.63]Go.
[43:57.43]Fuck you.
[43:57.95]Don't bump into that shit.
[44:01.13]Go on.
[44:03.77]Go on, go on, go on.
[44:04.69]Anything else?
[44:05.31]No.
[44:09.59]Oh, somebody locked in there.
[44:10.37]How do I ever save them?
[44:14.75]This is probably a good ending and a bad ending, I'm sure.
[44:16.89]Should I Indiana Jones this?
[44:19.59]And close this and be safe from the explosion in the fridge?
[44:25.38]That was very timely.
[44:30.42]Okay.
[44:35.40]Imagine that I just got stuck there forever.
[44:37.90]I think I'm going to have to push this and then jump on it.
[44:51.19]I do think that's what I have to do.
[44:53.41]Oh, god damn it.
[44:59.60]Uh, can't they put me in the other room?
[45:01.33]I lit the lighter already.
[45:04.73]Like, I lit the thing.
[45:05.75]What is the point?
[45:06.73]Uh, whatever.
[45:11.73]Rage montage?
[45:12.41]What are you talking about?
[45:13.05]I'm fine.
[45:19.29]No rage montage here.
[45:20.66]Just us people.
[45:22.74]Just us having funners.
[45:27.34]Alright.
[45:29.38]I'm just going to push this and see what happens.
[45:32.36]Something else has to probably... One of these other weights is going to be up here, I assume.
[45:35.27]Yeah, there it is.
[45:36.59]Just going to grab that and drop.
[45:38.89]Let out the little gnome.
[45:42.51]And grab this.
[45:46.43]I thought I just didn't get that, and I was about to be very angry.
[45:49.21]Is there a person in there?
[45:59.50]Where are the nightmares, by the way?
[46:00.74]This is just a lot of pushing blocks.
[46:08.14]I saw one interesting nightmare.
[46:16.97]All we're getting is these weird slugs and some creepy guy that crawls around.
[46:20.63]Are we going to see that guy again?
[46:33.16]don't don't how because I was looking at chat I looked over a chat I don't you know I don't need an excuse okay it it happened that's all you need to know it happened that's it you don't need to know anything else wasn't I just here yeah and I guess this was electrified we turned off the electricity
[47:01.86]And now we go with, uh... Oh, come on.
[47:09.03]Oh, no, watch out for the fucking janitor.
[47:10.69]Watch out for the evil, spooky janitor!
[47:12.95]Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[47:16.59]Some say the janitor still roams these halls.
[47:21.66]Boo!
[47:23.92]Fuck, hold on.
[47:37.51]Are you okay?
[47:38.29]I'm fine.
[47:39.07]Are you okay?
[47:42.13]I think... I don't know.
[47:47.01]Whatever.
[47:49.57]I have to, like, run with the janitor can.
[47:51.51]I get it.
[47:52.31]I know.
[47:59.68]I'm actually an idiot.
[48:00.60]No, I just have... I know what I have to do.
[48:03.91]I have to move with the janitor can.
[48:06.69]That's fine.
[48:07.23]I get it.
[48:12.75]Just watch.
[48:13.73]I'll get it right now.
[48:15.45]Here comes the janitor can.
[48:18.72]Just have to go like this.
[48:24.74]See?
[48:25.06]Whoa!
[48:27.66]We're good.
[48:28.45]Stay right here.
[48:30.13]And then give it a move.
[48:34.00]There it is.
[48:35.00]Sorry, I was making a fucking joke.
[48:38.32]Not allowed to make those on twitch.tv.
[48:41.54]Uh-oh!
[48:44.97]Things are getting intense here!
[48:46.57]Alright, somebody give me, like, the spoiler.
[48:54.16]No, don't give me any spoilers.
[48:55.22]What am I talking about?
[48:55.90]Don't do that.
[48:59.09]Alright, I made it out of the tutorial.
[49:03.53]It's time to play the game.
[49:08.37]Thank you, Funky Berlin.
[49:11.79]I want to tip a hundred bucks, but based on your jokes today, I feel like this is it so far.
[49:17.14]Come on, you didn't like the Kenny joke, the fucking South Park joke in the beginning?
[49:20.40]That's worth at least $200.
[49:21.90]No, I'm kidding.
[49:24.94]Thank you, Funky.
[49:32.04]I can go right or I can go up.
[49:33.48]Let's go right.
[49:34.12]Another office building.
[49:42.44]Am I supposed to do anything with these guys?
[49:49.11]Isn't this how that movie starts?
[49:50.71]It is.
[49:55.73]This is, this is like the, the... What's that, what's that fucking movie, that famous like movie where like the people go inside like the cupboard and they go to like a far off land?
[50:02.93]Neverland?
[50:04.37]No, what is it called?
[50:05.19]Uh... Narnia!
[50:07.35]That's how we get to Narnia.
[50:13.09]I like this.
[50:19.30]What's the point of these things?
[50:24.19]Do I just burn this place down?
[50:25.53]I don't know.
[50:27.47]The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.
[50:30.79]This doesn't do it for me.
[50:31.69]I don't know why I'm taking this in here.
[50:35.20]I'm going to move this out of the way.
[50:40.52]There's going to be some Narnia shit over there, but whatever.
[50:46.20]We'll figure it out in a minute.
[50:47.00]I can open up that.
[50:51.09]I can also go up, too.
[50:52.15]Let me just make sure I'm not missing anything.
[50:55.67]Might be.
[50:56.03]Hold on.
[50:58.59]Gonna put up these tax attorney files.
[50:59.99]Ow.
[51:03.07]That would probably hurt.
[51:05.03]Oh, I win.
[51:16.30]Okay.
[51:17.98]Hold on.
[51:18.56]Not yet.
[51:24.34]Can I climb this?
[51:26.86]I probably can, but, you know, whatever.
[51:29.07]Let's just go.
[51:31.33]But wait.
[51:32.79]It didn't go up yet.
[51:33.53]Let me see.
[51:34.93]This is the first, like, non-linear part of this game.
[51:36.99]Let's explore and see what it is.
[51:39.65]Might as well.
[51:46.88]Duh.
[51:48.60]Alright, who cares about that?
[51:51.22]You need that file on your desk for tomorrow.
[51:52.82]What file?
[51:53.20]What are you talking about?
[51:57.37]Don't skip the optional path.
[51:58.71]I'm not.
[52:01.61]The closet was actually the secret.
[52:05.62]Well, I... I can come back.
[52:08.02]I just want to see what's in this room.
[52:15.56]That might have been the secret.
[52:18.64]Okay, I hope it puts me back.
[52:24.77]Put me at the bottom of the stairs.
[52:26.49]It's going to skip.
[52:28.10]No!
[52:28.82]Shit!
[52:30.00]What are you doing?
[52:31.16]Put me back!
[52:32.68]I don't want to be here.
[52:33.58]I don't want to be in this room.
[52:36.06]Oh, come on.
[52:37.08]What?
[52:38.88]Oh, my God.
[52:39.72]I missed this.
[52:40.74]Okay.
[52:41.48]That was... For the love of fucking God.
[53:03.00]What am I supposed to do?
[53:10.48]You sit on your PC all day playing video games?
[53:13.27]No, I do not.
[53:15.31]No, I don't.
[53:19.39]No, I do not.
[53:22.09]Didn't I make that clear like a stream ago?
[53:35.26]Clearly not.
[53:36.34]Alright, well, like, I wish this fucking giant asshole would get out of the way.
[53:45.35]Can I, like, open one of these?
[53:51.57]Man, I went for sushi that one time.
[53:53.11]Man, it's true.
[53:58.25]I really wish this guy would get out of the way.
[53:59.47]The picture frames?
[54:01.89]Well, can I, like, grab onto this guy's pants?
[54:21.67]The amount of times I've broken this person's bones.
[54:26.79]It isn't a guy.
[54:27.59]It's pants.
[54:28.05]This is clearly a guy.
[54:29.15]This is clearly a very short person in those pants.
[54:44.44]Alright.
[54:44.76]I'm going to vote over here.
[54:52.32]Can I open this?
[54:55.50]Wait, hold on.
[54:56.12]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[54:57.18]Do I have to bounce off the suitcase?
[55:03.40]Like fucking Operation Dumbo Drop.
[55:07.40]Remember the name of that dumb movie was?
[55:08.86]I think I have to do that.
[55:09.54]Let's see.
[55:13.54]Yeah.
[55:39.43]Hey, you missed.
[55:41.17]I don't know if you saw that.
[55:47.09]Right there.
[55:47.49]I just gotta jump first.
[55:49.49]I just gotta jump a little farther than I just... If you don't blame this guy's fucking dirty laundry that's in the way.
[56:10.29]Try another.
[56:12.99]Am I missing something here?
[56:14.13]I feel like I am.
[56:16.13]This is not a funny joke.
[56:17.33]I swear to God, I'm just trying to fucking do this right.
[56:19.41]Third time's the charm.
[56:22.03]Here it is, like right here.
[56:25.82]Is there something that I'm missing?
[56:27.34]There's like a light bulb over there.
[56:30.46]I swear to God, if I'm not supposed to be doing this, I really feel like I'm not supposed to be doing this.
[56:43.12]No, I'm not supposed to bounce off the suitcase.
[56:49.28]That's not what happens.
[56:52.01]Okay.
[56:52.89]Oh, god damn it.
[57:00.75]It was so much less complicated than I was making it.
[57:04.32]I just have to push the fucking lever.
[57:06.50]Come on.
[57:10.88]Suitcases and trampolines.
[57:12.14]Yeah, this is like a cartoon.
[57:13.20]This isn't supposed to be real life.
[57:16.24]Sorry, guys.
[57:17.44]We're not talking about real life here.
[57:19.34]We're talking about like a video game.
[57:25.93]Yeah, there's like a bunch of like weird monsters and a guy with a goofy hat on.
[57:34.22]Don't give me shit because we're playing a cartoon game.
[57:37.24]And like, in the cartoon world, I would have bounced off that suitcase.
[57:40.58]Tommy Pickles would have bounced off that suitcase.
[57:44.48]And you know it.
[57:46.75]Okay, there's like a weird, there's a thing up there I gotta smash.
[57:56.87]Making a mess.
[58:04.75]I just wanted to pick up the plunger, but I picked up everything around it.
[58:07.21]So, there you go.
[58:08.70]Anything else?
[58:09.28]Get the key.
[58:10.42]And let's get the fuck out of here.
[58:13.30]Holy shit.
[58:14.20]That would have been bad.
[58:17.70]Alright, give me the key.
[58:19.54]And where does this key actually go?
[58:21.70]Is there like a door?
[58:22.52]Am I missing something here?
[58:25.60]Does it just bring it down?
[58:31.29]A little keyhole or so?
[58:32.41]I don't know.
[58:32.79]Whatever the fuck this is.
[58:35.09]Some magic key.
[58:35.97]Okay.
[58:50.47]There it is.
[58:51.49]Yeah.
[58:57.04]And... Unlockable, downloadable, unlockable content.
[59:01.31]What?
[59:02.25]Oh.
[59:06.11]Should I bring this again?
[59:06.91]I'm just going to bring this just in case I need to fit this somewhere.
[59:10.73]Oh, God.
[59:11.44]Fucking get... Okay, get it.
[59:18.68]Bring it in here.
[59:20.24]Just in case I need this for something.
[59:23.68]Watch out, there's a monkey right here.
[59:29.96]Alright, got it.
[59:35.25]Got that first try.
[59:36.97]You're welcome.
[59:42.31]I have to bring this to the end to get the DLC.
[59:44.05]That's what this is.
[59:44.67]Nope.
[59:54.14]I can climb this.
[59:54.92]No, the lights are turning off.
[59:59.51]That's how you can tell something's going, something's happening.
[60:07.13]Thanks, Jimmer, for never wasting our time.
[60:08.77]What do you mean?
[60:09.95]See, I knew I was going to need this.
[60:13.53]Wasting your time.
[60:14.11]I don't want to waste anybody's time.
[60:15.23]I want you guys to be like, wow, my time was very much appreciated.
[60:18.83]And it is.
[60:19.55]It is very much appreciated.
[60:25.27]I can hit that button again.
[60:26.61]Is there another button over here?
[60:30.25]Why am I holding this like such a fucking dickhead?
[60:31.93]What am I doing?
[60:32.39]Let's go get the button.
[60:47.00]Hi-ya.
[60:48.82]I didn't get that first try.
[60:49.72]It's alright, though.
[60:55.19]Can I even do this again?
[60:57.07]Yeah.
[60:58.17]Yeah, smash that fucking like button.
[61:00.36]Alright, now we chill.
[61:10.08]I guess I have to be in the perfect spot.
[61:24.95]Alright.
[61:25.47]How much more do we got in this game?
[61:27.39]What should I take with me?
[61:29.45]Should I take the Shovel Knight main character or should I take the Clasping Monkey?
[61:35.72]Nah, we're done with Shovel Knight tie-ins.
[61:37.86]I'm taking the Monkey.
[61:44.92]Oh, no.
[61:47.34]Okay.
[61:53.02]What's wrong with me?
[61:57.52]Am I going to be alright?
[62:00.86]You guys know I have to do this, right?
[62:05.26]I just needed to see what happened.
[62:07.42]That was purely for scientific purposes.
[62:12.85]I know.
[62:13.15]I needed to see what happened.
[62:14.79]Who knows?
[62:23.97]Tommy Pickles.
[62:27.65]Okay, I gotta turn that off, obviously.
[62:30.67]Get him.
[62:30.89]Alright, there's like poison gas and, you know, I need to eat.
[62:36.67]That's what it is.
[62:37.23]There's a hunger system in this game.
[62:39.51]The more puzzles you solve, the more food you need to eat.
[62:42.15]Very interesting.
[62:46.61]Very interesting stuff.
[62:47.85]Because you're using your brain and you get hungry.
[62:56.73]Am I just... Am I dead?
[63:00.29]There's nothing to eat right here.
[63:02.09]No?
[63:02.29]I'm still moving.
[63:06.47]Uh... I think I might have to pick up a rat.
[63:10.25]I do.
[63:10.87]Yep.
[63:11.37]I gotta eat one of the rats.
[63:21.18]Okay.
[63:21.68]I made it.
[63:22.06]I made it to the rotten meat.
[63:29.60]Alright, we're like a little bit more than an hour into this game.
[63:33.78]And finally, we're able to play.
[63:37.38]There's a trap.
[63:47.29]No, no, it's Mr. Longarms!
[63:53.75]Um, I can't move.
[63:59.95]Alright, I woke up.
[64:02.63]Here comes, like, the Monty Python character.
[64:10.11]Okay, that worked.
[64:16.04]No, we're facing our fears head-on.
[64:17.86]This game's about, like, fears.
[64:19.62]Face them head-on.
[64:23.80]Get out here, Dad!
[64:34.40]Sorry, I'm gonna have to use you for a second.
[64:38.84]Sorry, little Johnny.
[64:39.66]I'm gonna have to use you as bait so I can pull the lever.
[64:43.90]That's all this matters.
[64:46.06]I know that your life is probably pretty important, but I have to grab this dumb fucking puzzle lever.
[64:51.62]Sorry.
[64:56.17]Sorry about that.
[65:01.97]Shit.
[65:04.67]Oh, I gotta get something to hang on there.
[65:06.05]Okay.
[65:12.67]Sneak back here.
[65:15.67]How long is this game?
[65:18.65]Anybody know?
[65:20.47]What's the length?
[65:25.54]Uh, I can't go this way.
[65:33.40]Is there a point to this?
[65:35.31]No.
[65:41.03]Okay.
[65:41.47]Let's go back there.
[65:42.09]I guess there's something there.
[65:43.11]It's about three to four hours.
[65:44.23]Alright, well, we're beating the whole thing on stream tonight.
[65:50.62]Um... Okay.
[66:00.82]I can move.
[66:03.10]No, I just need to throw myself.
[66:09.17]I love how it's giving me this tutorial.
[66:11.93]Like, you couldn't have told me this when I was hanging on it last time?
[66:30.30]Okay, we saw how that happened.
[66:33.98]Oh no, it's Mr. Snake Man!
[66:37.61]I did it on, that was fun purpose, I wanted to see what happens.
[66:41.71]It was a joke, yes it was, it was, I promise.
[66:47.81]What, like 10 to 12 hours?
[66:49.15]No, this game's not gonna take 12 hours.
[66:58.48]No, Mr. Snake Man, not Mr. Snake Man.
[67:00.28]Mr. Snake Man would never hurt anybody.
[67:09.81]It's going to take 12 hours.
[67:10.77]It is not going to take 12 hours.
[67:14.78]I've never played a Tim Burton right side of the piano platformer game that took more than three hours.
[67:19.65]So, no.
[67:20.23]There's no way that's the case.
[67:33.25]Thank you, Ghoul Champ, for your bits.
[67:38.71]Pity bits to repair your bones.
[67:41.58]Well, thank you.
[67:44.38]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[67:45.38]What's this?
[67:49.02]I don't know.
[67:51.00]May have just locked myself in the room.
[68:04.08]Can I just push the door open?
[68:08.66]I don't think so.
[68:09.17]There's a hole up there.
[68:12.89]I guess I can climb this.
[68:15.17]Yeah.
[68:19.21]Bathtub.
[68:25.11]Anything in the bathtub?
[68:29.07]Confirmed.
[68:29.65]Nothing in bathtub.
[68:33.76]What do we got for a rating for this game right now?
[68:35.76]What do you guys say for a rating for this game?
[68:39.25]Out of 10?
[68:41.25]So, I mean, I'm probably... Okay, well, this is the... Okay, this guy's like... This guy's actually kind of funny.
[68:49.75]This guy has these, like, little tiny arms.
[68:51.37]What is he doing?
[68:55.42]Is he smelling me?
[68:57.45]He can smell me.
[68:59.39]Oh, okay.
[69:01.15]Can he fit down here?
[69:03.05]Oh, he can fit down here.
[69:05.35]Oh, God.
[69:10.62]Yeah.
[69:11.14]What do you do now?
[69:18.59]Let me...
[69:26.23]Yeah, I mean... I'm probably just gonna... Let's just see what he does here.
[69:36.68]He gets like three or four pieces of toilet paper.
[69:42.43]And... He wraps up the person.
[69:49.63]And he puts them into the hamper.
[69:52.39]Alright, that's it.
[69:57.71]right yeah he does it again and they go that way so he's like he reaches for something in here okay oh god damn it let's just go I think I just have to run
[70:26.78]Yeah, there's a little hole here.
[70:27.86]Alright, I get it.
[70:31.20]I was gonna get in the cage.
[70:38.98]You know what I was trying to do.
[70:40.24]I was trying to get in the cage and have him be like, oh, there's another person here.
[70:53.26]Fucking stupid ass dumb physics.
[70:57.91]Okay, nice slide.
[70:58.97]Alright, this is obviously for this.
[71:09.03]Turn it.
[71:15.33]Yeah, like, what was that slide?
[71:17.13]Why am I blaming... Okay, there's a guy coming again.
[71:19.09]Let's slide again.
[71:20.03]Is this gonna hurt?
[71:23.27]No, it didn't hurt.
[71:27.58]I'm good.
[71:35.10]Watch out.
[71:35.64]He's throwing stuff in the trash.
[71:44.31]Leave the shoe on the ground.
[71:45.13]What the hell are you doing?
[71:47.69]Oh, no.
[71:48.25]More dad shoes.
[71:54.06]Don't you guys know?
[71:54.58]There's no fall damage when you land on dad shoes.
[71:59.16]And clown shoes.
[72:07.18]I know this part from Star Wars.
[72:09.34]This is where they're in the trash thing, and the guy... This is gonna be just like Star Wars.
[72:14.26]These people watched a little too much Star Wars.
[72:16.16]It's gonna be like a... I told you.
[72:19.03]When they get in the trash heap, and they're like, What is that thing under there?
[72:21.73]Wookie!
[72:22.93]His name's Chewie, but you know what I mean.
[72:31.18]And they start, like, shooting, and it bounces around the room, and Luke is like, Hey, what are you doing?
[72:34.52]You trying to kill us?
[72:40.44]I mean, don't you guys wanna know what it is?
[72:41.46]I kinda wanna know what it is.
[72:48.86]But we'll never know, because I, like, did that well.
[72:53.16]Hey, look guys, it's me!
[72:54.84]It's the Scrooge McDuck of shoes!
[73:01.38]Yeah, that was good.
[73:07.94]Fucking DuckTales, remember that show?
[73:15.37]Good joke.
[73:16.61]It was okay.
[73:21.55]And he's back.
[73:23.01]Here comes a slide.
[73:24.95]Yep.
[73:26.15]Didn't even need to give me the tutorial for that one.
[73:27.69]Wait, can I get his, like, should I smash his arm in there?
[73:30.95]Oh, fuck.
[73:34.74]Oh, fuck.
[73:36.30]Oh, no.
[73:38.14]Oh, no.
[73:40.44]Oh, no.
[73:42.16]Oh, no is right.
[73:43.34]Maybe he won't see me.
[73:50.31]He doesn't see me.
[73:53.37]Okay, we're safe for now.
[73:57.85]What is he?
[73:58.99]I think I might see him over there.
[74:01.31]Which one of these boxes is he in?
[74:05.67]Is he behind this box?
[74:09.01]No, I'm just looking right at him.
[74:10.57]Yeah.
[74:13.03]Hey!
[74:19.27]What?
[74:20.25]Wait, wait, wait.
[74:25.81]What?
[74:29.25]That was fucking bullshit.
[74:33.53]I don't believe that for a second.
[74:40.58]He used the force.
[74:46.08]Hold on.
[74:46.64]I'm doing that again.
[74:48.46]We're breaking this fucking game.
[74:51.48]Because I'm going to assume, like, we're not going to fall.
[74:55.04]If you're on the wall, his AI just doesn't understand that you're, like, holding onto the wall.
[75:00.38]Right?
[75:01.28]So I can literally just be right here as long as I'm not falling.
[75:03.86]And when he presses the button to open it, I'm going to start running.
[75:06.59]I feel like he has no idea because the game was not programmed to know about things on the wall.
[75:22.03]Okay.
[75:23.13]Go.
[75:25.86]Okay, so he can't.
[75:33.50]He's blind, but it doesn't matter.
[75:35.22]So wait, what if I just don't... Alright, I'm going to do the thing it wants me to do.
[75:47.32]I'm going to go into the...
[75:53.06]He's blind, dumb idiot streamer.
[75:59.80]He wants me to like sit in here and get really scared because he comes over and it's like, oh, you scary guys in here.
[76:12.78]He actually just doesn't have any eyes.
[76:19.52]There you go, and then he hears the other guy and he's gonna chase the other guy and then I can leave I get it Anybody else feel like that they could just do a running like punt into this guy's head and like be okay?
[76:39.84]Okay, let's go What was that all about?
[76:47.00]Alright, he's like right here somewhere
[76:54.18]Where the fuck is he?
[76:54.88]Alright, I'm safe.
[77:08.26]Um, so... That's a pretty good slide, I agree.
[77:15.31]Nothing can be done with this, so I guess I just have to get in here?
[77:19.23]No, I can move this.
[77:28.34]But why?
[77:28.92]Oh, okay.
[77:30.36]That's why.
[77:30.82]I feel like I should take this guy with me.
[77:43.98]No, throw him over there.
[77:47.72]Oh my goodness.
[77:48.56]Please, just throw him over there.
[77:49.70]I'm going to need to throw him at a button or something.
[77:57.81]Okay, we move.
[78:00.69]We move.
[78:01.33]Through here.
[78:03.40]There he is.
[78:10.36]He's measuring his finger next to his spoon.
[78:12.46]This guy's got a lot of lights on upstairs.
[78:18.03]Or he's doing his own personal puppet show in the mirror of the spoon.
[78:25.58]Okay.
[78:26.50]Now he's going over there.
[78:27.22]I guess I can go up this way.
[78:28.74]I think I can distract him, right?
[78:29.86]Like, I'm going to throw this over here and he's going to hear the noise.
[78:34.34]And, like, that's not what worked.
[78:37.30]Okay, that's fine.
[78:40.90]Like, how do I get up here?
[78:44.52]Like, yeah, I guess I can't go that way.
[78:47.59]Over here?
[78:48.01]Uh...
[78:58.23]There's a thing to smash.
[79:00.01]Got it.
[79:10.00]I mean... I don't know.
[79:16.47]Did I miss, like, a spot over here I could go up in?
[79:18.83]I guess, like, over here?
[79:19.57]Yeah, I can go up here.
[79:21.95]Yeah, we're gonna have to make some noise.
[79:27.91]So we make noise, like, throw this over here.
[79:31.55]Go listen to that.
[79:32.23]Okay, yeah, so this carpet, I get it.
[79:44.46]I throw that over there, I wait for him, I sneak by, I grab the shrine of the silver monkey from Guts, and then I get grabbed by one of those guys hiding in, like, the closet.
[79:54.92]I got you.
[79:57.69]Oh, fuck.
[79:58.77]I gotta, like, jump this.
[80:01.57]Oh, please!
[80:02.62]Now I'm in fucking trouble.
[80:10.78]I need to get this up there so I can have another monkey.
[80:14.91]Whatever.
[80:18.33]Just sitting over there anyways.
[80:24.07]I need to get to that monkey.
[80:29.20]He doesn't hear that.
[80:29.84]Okay.
[80:32.32]Got it.
[80:32.72]So now throw this.
[80:35.96]Where do I want to throw this?
[80:37.62]Like over here?
[80:39.85]Like over there.
[80:50.79]Okay.
[80:51.05]Get out of the way.
[80:53.64]Get out of the way.
[80:54.10]Out of the way.
[80:54.46]Go.
[80:54.74]Go.
[80:54.98]I don't even care about the fucking monkey.
[80:56.04]Go.
[80:56.16]Go.
[81:01.59]Oh shit, he's got long arms.
[81:04.35]Oh shit, he is Mr. Long Arms.
[81:06.43]Push!
[81:07.17]Push it!
[81:08.07]Push this!
[81:10.35]Push this!
[81:10.89]Okay, we're good.
[81:23.14]Alright, have I beaten the game yet?
[81:31.45]10 out of 10 observation.
[81:32.79]Yeah.
[81:35.21]What the fuck?
[81:35.87]I did more than one of these guys.
[81:36.93]I don't understand.
[81:42.80]Yeah, I guess I can make it over there.
[81:47.40]Is he going to fall?
[81:55.02]He's going to hear that.
[81:57.25]Yep.
[81:58.53]He's like, alright, just stay on the carpets.
[82:02.11]And just, like, stay over here.
[82:03.01]I have to throw a shoe at that.
[82:09.02]Give me a shoe.
[82:10.66]Give me one of dad's shoes.
[82:12.70]Mm-hmm.
[82:15.40]What was that?
[82:15.84]Come on, it's my chance.
[82:17.28]It's my chance.
[82:23.43]Oh, no.
[82:24.01]Oh.
[82:26.21]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[82:28.13]My finger is slipping off the controller.
[82:34.78]What are you doing?
[82:36.86]What are you doing?
[82:40.16]Knock this over, right?
[82:43.14]No.
[82:43.59]Okay, don't knock that over.
[82:44.43]Just go.
[82:45.03]Just move.
[82:45.29]There's a door?
[82:51.75]There's a door?
[82:55.05]Climb this and jump from book to book.
[83:00.79]It's a giant piano.
[83:01.93]It's an Acme piano.
[83:03.05]Cool.
[83:07.23]Like that.
[83:09.17]Come on, you know how to do it.
[83:09.95]Mm-hmm.
[83:14.59]Can I keep grabbing, or do I have to just go from here to here?
[83:16.84]I believe, yes, I do.
[83:19.90]Then drop.
[83:20.34]Yeah, I'm going to have to drop the piano on his head.
[83:22.02]Alright.
[83:24.07]That's how you kill the bad guy.
[83:27.98]Yeah, he's gonna fall down there, and I need to drop the fucking piano on him.
[83:33.30]Just like a goddamn cartoon.
[83:34.92]Alright, is there any... Look over there.
[83:42.83]Okay, I need to jump this.
[83:49.52]I need to get that piece.
[83:50.64]I can't see, though.
[83:51.46]Where is he?
[83:53.39]He can't see.
[83:54.35]That's fine.
[83:55.37]Easy.
[83:57.71]He's picking up a book.
[83:58.49]I need to climb this.
[84:02.88]Oh, fuck.
[84:03.60]What?
[84:04.34]What?
[84:04.92]What?
[84:07.08]What is going on?
[84:07.64]Where the fuck is this dumb camera?
[84:11.30]Oh my fucking god, please.
[84:13.26]Like, honest to god.
[84:14.70]That fucking camera was stupid.
[84:16.08]Ah!
[84:21.32]Ah!
[84:24.74]We're fine.
[84:33.00]Stupid.
[84:38.33]Strats.
[84:44.11]I think I might just have to walk by him.
[84:46.31]No, that's wood.
[84:50.79]I don't understand.
[84:51.79]What am I supposed to do then?
[85:01.33]Don't you feel like it wants me to go, like, climb up here?
[85:05.23]Yeah.
[85:06.53]Maybe.
[85:06.91]Let's grab this.
[85:10.79]Okay.
[85:12.09]Well, there we go.
[85:12.71]What?
[85:18.27]What?
[85:18.81]What's the matter?
[85:28.05]Can I just say, by the way, this guy's not scary.
[85:31.79]He's just kind of goofy looking.
[85:38.26]So I'm going to make noise if I go across this.
[85:44.29]Let him go that way and then throw the... I don't even know.
[85:48.91]There's a lot of random noisemakers.
[85:55.24]Probably just need to throw this behind me, so he gets out of the way.
[86:00.62]Oh, fuck!
[86:01.46]No!
[86:02.02]Pick up the fucking monkey!
[86:04.36]Oh, you stupid shit!
[86:09.31]You know what?
[86:09.79]Like, fucking... Why are there blocks here?
[86:13.63]Did you see that fucking juke?!
[86:15.47]Did you take that, Winnie the Pooh?!
[86:19.39]He doesn't know where I am!
[86:20.87]He keeps, like, hearing noises!
[86:37.10]Where am I?
[86:43.30]Got it.
[86:45.08]We're good.
[86:48.24]Nice suitcase.
[86:49.86]Should I turn the TV on?
[86:53.54]I gotta turn the TV on, right?
[86:54.64]There's gotta be something to do with the TV.
[86:56.13]Yeah, here we go.
[86:58.59]Oh, no.
[86:58.91]Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[87:00.27]He's gonna hear that.
[87:00.73]He's gonna come in the door.
[87:02.63]Where do I go?
[87:03.55]What do I do with this?
[87:05.29]Why did I just turn the TV on?
[87:06.45]Of course he's gonna hear the fucking TV!
[87:09.31]Oh no, where do I hide?
[87:10.41]Right here.
[87:12.97]No, I should've hid behind that fucking suitcase!
[87:14.97]Shit!
[87:24.39]That's like what I just heard.
[87:30.01]I gotta hide behind the other suitcase.
[87:36.50]Is this his favorite show or what?
[87:37.96]What's he doing?
[87:41.12]God damn it.
[87:53.13]I guess I can get by him like this.
[87:55.27]I hope the show doesn't end.
[88:05.80]He has to open the door again, doesn't he?
[88:07.02]That door's closed, right?
[88:09.30]Is the door closed?
[88:11.65]I can't tell if that door is closed.
[88:15.57]I can't see.
[88:18.35]I think it's open, right?
[88:20.11]Yeah, it is.
[88:32.34]Come on.
[88:34.83]Avoid the glass.
[88:36.77]It don't even matter anymore.
[88:38.41]Oh shit, I'm running out of breath.
[88:40.48]Slow down.
[88:47.08]There we go.
[88:47.62]Okay.
[88:50.24]Now I put this in here and turn the knob and we continue our quest to get the fuck out of here.
[88:55.62]You know what I mean?
[89:02.13]Am I playing on easy?
[89:03.15]There is no setting.
[89:05.15]Let me just play.
[89:15.33]Yeah, I almost just lost right there.
[89:16.65]That would have been so disappointing.
[89:18.15]You all know it.
[89:18.63]That would have been excruciatingly disappointing.
[89:26.22]Okay, watch out for the steam.
[89:29.12]Steam's gonna blow up into me and kill me.
[89:31.00]Yep, we avoid that.
[89:32.84]Pull off the lever here.
[89:34.40]No.
[89:36.39]Can't reach the door from there.
[89:39.57]Need the mine cart.
[89:42.43]Dude, what are you playing on?
[89:43.17]Fucking normal?
[89:46.33]Yeah, what's the matter?
[89:47.84]Book?
[89:53.06]Please turn on your facecam.
[89:55.85]No, no facecam right now.
[89:57.77]There's no reason for me to have a facecam.
[89:59.39]This game's not that scary.
[90:01.47]It's not a scary game.
[90:02.39]It's just like an interesting game.
[90:09.41]And then get behind here and push it.
[90:10.71]Mm-hmm.
[90:15.55]Get it past the steam.
[90:21.63]Yup.
[90:24.45]Facecam, interest cam.
[90:26.17]Oh, an interest cam.
[90:28.47]It's very interesting.
[90:31.02]It's a very interesting game.
[90:32.40]Put on an interest cam.
[90:40.19]Get up there.
[90:52.88]What?
[90:54.20]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[91:00.27]Why?
[91:02.25]Oh, goodness fucking gracious.
[91:07.01]What's behind the door?
[91:07.87]Yeah, everybody probably did that.
[91:10.23]I can't be the only one.
[91:16.97]Such skill.
[91:21.12]You're gonna give me like an Alice in Wonderland door right now?
[91:24.74]It's been like an hour and 30 minutes of just kind of puzzles, not like fake doors.
[91:32.85]Point the facecam at the screen.
[91:35.47]No.
[91:39.77]Get in there.
[91:43.17]Okay, hang on to it.
[91:44.83]Don't let go.
[91:46.71]Okay, now let go.
[91:48.98]Here comes Grandpa Slenderman, whatever the hell you want to call him.
[92:02.31]Up, up, up.
[92:03.89]Let's get some light in here.
[92:04.69]Yeah.
[92:06.81]Mmm, I'll jump with the grill.
[92:10.93]Oh, no!
[92:17.27]Okay.
[92:18.95]Now they're adding the joke, I grab you when you don't know thing.
[92:25.07]Very cool game.
[92:26.81]I'm glad you started doing that.
[92:28.57]Wait, why didn't he grab me from that?
[92:32.91]I don't get it.
[92:33.40]There it is.
[92:41.98]Okay, we're good.
[92:45.06]He's going to do it again.
[92:45.82]This time he's going to accidentally grab a rabbit.
[92:48.62]Watch out for those pills on the ground.
[92:51.51]How's it going?
[92:51.85]It's going well.
[92:52.61]How are you?
[92:53.55]Also, thank you to Violet for the bits, Jeremy.
[92:55.49]Here's a dollar for you not to turn on your facecam.
[92:57.77]There it is.
[92:59.71]Assbag.
[93:01.27]Hey, Jeremy, fan since 2012.
[93:02.23]Love your humor and dedication.
[93:05.20]Usually can't make Tuesday streams because of work, but I made time.
[93:07.98]Keep on rocking.
[93:08.54]Well, thank you, Assbag.
[93:09.58]Uh-oh.
[93:11.38]Uh-oh.
[93:12.56]Uh-oh.
[93:15.46]Whoa, what is going on here?
[93:17.96]Internet's dead.
[93:24.26]What's going on here?
[93:30.01]My internet's kind of crap on the bed.
[93:31.35]Are we good?
[93:31.67]Is the stream alright?
[93:35.23]I think my internet might be shitting the bed.
[93:39.75]Maybe, is it okay now?
[93:41.79]That was weird.
[93:44.35]Well, hopefully we don't have a Comcast strikes again problem, but... Alright, well, I'm just going to say... If for some reason Stream just tanks and dies, I apologize.
[93:58.04]I'm sorry about that.
[93:59.22]I really hope it doesn't.
[94:01.20]But I'm sorry if it does.
[94:03.86]So, let's just keep going, I guess.
[94:08.12]But thank you, Aspeg.
[94:10.14]We come back to, hey, thanks, Aspeg.
[94:13.51]I think I just ran into, like, a weird... Oh, shit, he's coming in.
[94:17.23]Okay, okay, we just gotta move now.
[94:18.70]And he's gonna grab me.
[94:20.34]Fucking Comcast is, like, throttling me.
[94:26.10]Why slide there?
[94:27.28]I don't know what the hell I'm even doing.
[94:32.02]What?
[94:32.38]What?
[94:32.88]What?
[94:34.96]I don't know.
[94:37.38]We seem to be back to normal, though.
[94:41.35]Go up here.
[94:41.85]He can't reach me up here with his fucking spaghetti arms.
[94:43.81]He'll be alright.
[94:46.45]Right?
[94:47.27]At least I hope he can't.
[94:52.63]This isn't going to crush his arms, right?
[94:54.19]Oh, look at his little hands!
[94:57.96]He was like slowly coming up there.
[95:00.28]Alright, do I like just fucking smash this?
[95:05.88]No, you don't.
[95:06.76]You don't just smash this.
[95:13.10]I'm not sure what to do here.
[95:19.72]Here is the good part.
[95:29.51]Can I move anything?
[95:36.29]How do I smash that cage?
[95:38.47]Because I can sit here for a second.
[95:43.68]And then he stops, he comes over here with this hand, right?
[95:50.27]Can I move this?
[95:52.15]No, I would... I can't, I can't move that.
[95:57.37]Doesn't seem like I can move it.
[96:00.15]He switches hands.
[96:00.97]Should I just... I don't know.
[96:14.04]Alright, I got when he moves his hands.
[96:23.73]I'm just going for it.
[96:25.99]I guess I don't know Smash that jump up and get down I think
[96:41.59]So he's gonna hear me and grab me no matter like where I go here, right?
[96:47.28]I don't get it He comes over with this hand Let's just do it slow
[97:06.29]You know, I would love if holding R2 fucking actually grabbed the goddamn fucking thing.
[97:13.19]Like, I did that right, but the game just didn't want me to grab the cage.
[97:20.16]In fact, I don't even need to do what I'm doing right now.
[97:22.26]But I'm gonna do it again.
[97:26.72]Oh my god.
[97:28.28]Like, honest to fucking god.
[97:33.92]Like, please, please grab the cage.
[97:37.48]Please.
[97:38.78]Please.
[97:44.19]What the fuck was that?
[97:59.59]Like, just let me fucking grab the goddamn cage!
[98:03.16]I don't understand.
[98:04.16]I've put my hands on this fucking cage three times.
[98:10.63]And he just let go of it.
[98:12.93]Yeah, I let go.
[98:20.50]He goes like this.
[98:21.74]Yeah.
[98:44.16]Fucking damn it, dude.
[98:48.54]I fucking pulled it out too.
[98:51.17]He comes back with this hand.
[98:53.09]Have to wait for that.
[99:06.22]What is happening?
[99:09.04]What the fuck was that?
[99:16.63]I had my hands on it and I was pulling backwards.
[99:19.69]Why?
[99:20.97]Why?
[99:24.85]I literally was just fucking pulling.
[99:31.18]I was pulling backwards and nothing happened.
[99:37.00]I did nothing wrong there.
[99:44.45]How did I?
[99:44.93]Don't ask me.
[99:45.29]I have no idea.
[99:46.04]You saw the animation.
[99:47.02]I was leaning backwards.
[99:54.46]Look.
[99:55.44]There it is.
[99:55.96]I did it.
[99:56.24]Okay.
[100:01.38]Now what?
[100:01.70]Now I have to get the other side.
[100:04.64]He does it faster now.
[100:08.34]Does he reach back with this hand again?
[100:09.94]He probably does, right?
[100:12.15]Does he?
[100:12.43]Yeah, he does.
[100:13.23]Okay, here we go.
[100:23.13]Uh-huh.
[100:28.82]Oh, shit.
[100:34.76]Fuck your arms.
[100:36.72]Fuck you.
[100:38.27]Oh, you wanna grab me now?
[100:39.41]No, you can't.
[100:40.71]I win.
[100:49.40]Alright, I'm gonna be real.
[100:50.50]I did exactly what I was trying.
[100:52.94]Like, I would love to jump.
[100:55.24]Just jump.
[100:58.22]This game's got a 4 out of 10 right now.
[101:00.00]Like, this game has a fucking 4 out of 10.
[101:03.05]Because of these shitty fucking controls.
[101:06.58]The game's like an 8.
[101:08.46]But it's a fucking 5.
[101:21.95]Where's the bonfire?
[101:22.87]I don't know.
[101:29.87]I feel like we've done this a lot.
[101:32.37]This, like, kind of go through the vents trope.
[101:35.31]Anybody else think that that's a bit kind of overdone in this game so far?
[101:38.29]I'm going to crawl through the vents.
[101:53.75]I'm going to get on this.
[101:54.42]I obviously have to grab on one of these hooks.
[101:59.76]Yep.
[102:02.18]This game is 5-8.
[102:05.62]I can see that.
[102:11.65]Is that a new monster?
[102:12.95]Oh, we got a new monster.
[102:14.33]That was like a butcher.
[102:19.72]That was like a pig butcher.
[102:20.76]Alright, I'm interested again.
[102:31.09]The game is taller than me.
[102:34.67]Come on.
[102:37.94]Get me the food.
[102:38.64]I gotta get the cheese off the mousetrap.
[102:43.18]I gotta get that one little piece of, like, black cheese.
[102:45.80]Nope.
[102:51.63]There's no cheese there.
[102:52.51]Somebody already ate it.
[102:56.81]The one piece of moldy cheese.
[103:02.62]That's one resilient rat.
[103:04.00]I have to eat the rat.
[103:16.53]Damn.
[103:17.49]Wow.
[103:20.80]Thank you, Brungerton, for the bits.
[103:24.92]Mary had a little lamb is a true story from a town in Massachusetts.
[103:30.84]That's, well, did not know that.
[103:34.10]Interesting information.
[103:34.88]Thank you, Brungerton.
[103:40.77]Hey, thanks, Assbag, again, for the bits.
[103:42.29]Comcast screwed up the shout-out.
[103:44.53]Here's another dollar to say Comcast sucks.
[103:47.37]Well, thanks, man.
[103:49.11]Also, Captain Dark for the five dollars.
[103:51.29]What did you say, though?
[103:53.46]He said, thanks for the five bucks, dude.
[103:55.14]Give my prime sub.
[103:57.54]Gave my prime sub to Seagull this month, so here's some bits I farmed to make up for it.
[104:02.68]Well, thank you, Captain Dark.
[104:04.44]Also, thanks again to Bia345.
[104:07.20]Thanks for the two dollars.
[104:09.18]Two dollars to turn on facecam.
[104:12.20]No, I'm not turning facecam on.
[104:15.40]No facecam.
[104:18.70]There shouldn't be a facecam for this game.
[104:20.46]It'll take it away.
[104:20.98]You're gonna be looking at my, like, shitty face.
[104:24.11]The floor is lava, by the way.
[104:34.50]I definitely have to push this.
[104:42.48]There we go.
[104:46.87]So we killed Mr. Longarms.
[104:48.91]So that leaves the pig monster, right?
[104:50.83]I guess.
[104:51.99]I guess.
[104:54.46]New area.
[104:57.56]Thanks for the cart.
[104:59.52]Whoever you are.
[105:00.12]Anything over here?
[105:06.09]Nope.
[105:06.97]Just blood.
[105:07.93]We're on a boat, by the way.
[105:08.77]Just figured that out.
[105:11.53]If anyone's curious, we are on a boat.
[105:12.89]We have to be on a boat.
[105:16.37]That shit's moving back and forth.
[105:19.61]Do I have to hide in these...
[105:22.80]And I hear the guy fucking sharpening his knives.
[105:25.94]Alright, so one of them's gonna be blind, the other one's gonna be deaf.
[105:30.06]This guy's gonna be deaf.
[105:31.48]Right?
[105:35.28]You got a blind guy, you got a deaf guy.
[105:36.69]This guy is awesome.
[105:48.75]Oh, what are you?
[105:50.85]Ah, you got a new ingredient in my soup.
[105:58.27]It's Eric Cartman.
[106:04.19]Yeah, it was Kenny and Cartman.
[106:07.45]Eric Cartman.
[106:16.12]He looks like something, I just don't know what.
[106:20.00]He's just, this guy's not even scary.
[106:21.12]He's just a weird, funny, fat looking guy that's making steaks.
[106:25.71]That's not that big of a deal.
[106:34.75]Oh, shit.
[106:37.88]What?
[106:41.92]So this guy can see and hear.
[106:43.98]So what's wrong with this guy?
[106:46.74]He's faster than the other guy, too.
[106:53.21]This guy's just a scary fat chef that looks like a melted fucking cabbage patch, kids.
[107:06.05]Okay.
[107:07.89]Can this guy, like, go away?
[107:08.97]Not very much cooking.
[107:11.17]Ah, just throw it in there.
[107:12.39]Whatever.
[107:13.35]Didn't even season that.
[107:18.21]I want to, like, open this.
[107:18.99]Can I pull this open?
[107:21.96]Apparently not.
[107:29.20]Why is that little guy just still standing there?
[107:33.36]Uh... I don't know.
[107:43.52]Give me the hiding spots.
[107:45.60]What?
[107:49.24]There's your seasoning.
[107:54.26]Here he's going.
[107:54.95]He's got it.
[107:55.27]There you go.
[108:00.55]Sprinkle it on the fish.
[108:01.51]Rub it in real nice.
[108:06.11]Is it weird that I would eat this?
[108:11.08]There's nothing bad about this.
[108:13.19]He was making these really nice looking steaks.
[108:15.95]And now he's got a freshly caught fish, I'm assuming.
[108:19.45]I don't see the problem.
[108:21.98]If you wanted to make this scary, they should have been like body parts.
[108:25.66]Right?
[108:25.86]Because there's something very not human about like consuming another human, right?
[108:31.44]So what's the big deal?
[108:34.09]Like why?
[108:35.05]He's just making regular food.
[108:42.50]This guy's too fat to get up here.
[108:43.72]What do I care?
[108:48.03]He so badly wants to get me.
[108:50.27]Oh, yeah?
[108:52.51]You need some of this in your food, buddy?
[108:54.15]Eat shit!
[109:04.40]I think you need a little bit more vinaigrette in there!
[109:11.71]I think I might need that at some point here soon.
[109:20.92]What's that?
[109:21.34]Bread?
[109:24.74]I swear to fucking God.
[109:27.36]Shit, I can't make a joke anymore.
[109:28.44]I have to go.
[109:30.88]He's going to do the elephant noise.
[109:31.86]Okay, we're good.
[109:37.87]Guy's got a really thick skull.
[109:38.99]He does.
[109:47.37]Alright, what is... Anything supposed to be here that I need to do?
[109:51.19]I've got a French baguette.
[109:56.05]Hmm.
[109:56.71]Oh.
[109:58.25]Fucking... I swear to God, dude.
[109:59.81]Really.
[110:00.39]Where's this key?
[110:03.09]I don't see a key anywhere.
[110:07.15]Drop the swordfish through his skull.
[110:09.71]Where's this fucking magic key?
[110:18.07]It's probably this way, whatever.
[110:19.47]Forget about the French baguette.
[110:26.95]Can I, like, knock that thing on him?
[110:29.39]I don't think so.
[110:29.99]I think he's just there for show.
[110:36.30]Fucking... Okay.
[110:40.12]I don't think I can knock him out or anything.
[110:42.36]Just gonna keep going left.
[110:46.34]He's just deboning a fish.
[110:48.04]I guess we go up.
[110:53.25]No other place to go.
[110:54.05]Just crawl up.
[110:56.97]That was the introduction to the guy.
[110:58.43]Cool.
[111:04.49]I guess, can I go over?
[111:05.67]No.
[111:07.72]Just take the tried and true way through the vents.
[111:11.42]This guy has two toilets.
[111:12.92]He shits so much that he has to have two toilets pressed together so the shit goes in different toilets.
[111:21.02]This is supposed to be scary, not funny.
[111:25.62]This guy has to get two airplane seats.
[111:31.02]No, but hold on.
[111:32.02]Let's examine this for a second.
[111:33.13]Just wait a minute.
[111:34.61]If that's the case, if you're sitting down here, there's a cheek right here, there's a cheek right here.
[111:39.63]His asshole is here.
[111:41.57]He's just shitting into the seam, down into the ground.
[111:46.21]This doesn't accomplish anything.
[111:51.37]There's nothing there that actually does.
[111:54.19]Hold on.
[111:56.53]I want to light this.
[112:01.71]Light it.
[112:03.19]There we go.
[112:07.29]Dual anuses?
[112:08.19]No.
[112:10.83]And I'm standing on the spot.
[112:12.77]When you're right, you're right.
[112:14.63]And you're right.
[112:19.61]Well, I just need to see what this is.
[112:27.10]What is it?
[112:28.48]What's in here?
[112:28.98]There's an elevator.
[112:30.12]I shouldn't have gone in here yet.
[112:32.22]But I did.
[112:40.15]We're back here.
[112:43.37]Did I miss a key up here?
[112:45.47]Or something?
[112:46.13]I just got a weird shortcut.
[112:48.96]Okay.
[112:55.18]Okay.
[113:04.37]He sits sideways, shitting into one toilet and pissing into the other.
[113:08.09]Oh, man.
[113:12.34]What a strange life.
[113:19.02]Is that eyes?
[113:19.66]Is that a slug?
[113:20.28]What is this?
[113:20.64]There's the key.
[113:23.91]Yeah, slugs are gonna come.
[113:24.73]This is another new monster.
[113:28.65]It's like Muddy the Mudskipper.
[113:29.97]Wait, there's another guy?
[113:31.05]It's a second one?
[113:38.03]Wait, how is he... It is two of them.
[113:42.75]Oh, come on.
[113:43.57]It puts me all the way back here.
[113:48.68]I hope I can just go right up.
[113:50.24]Yeah, I can.
[113:50.72]Good.
[113:53.57]So they go to the bathroom right next to each other.
[113:57.89]That's not terrifying.
[114:06.16]So, we just walk to the left.
[114:09.36]Yeah, they're just melted.
[114:10.21]They're just cabbage patch kids.
[114:11.39]They're just fat, melted cabbage patch kids.
[114:19.63]What's going on?
[114:20.31]Get up.
[114:28.62]Okay, well, obviously, just fucking get under here.
[114:37.47]This guy's different.
[114:38.21]This guy's a little different.
[114:41.35]They sleep right next to each other, too.
[114:43.31]Alright, well, that's the second chef.
[114:45.47]Which way does he go?
[114:49.12]He probably goes down in the kitchen.
[114:55.54]Oh, fuck.
[114:56.70]I think he's coming back.
[114:58.66]Is he?
[115:05.05]I don't know.
[115:08.38]I don't know what the fuck this guy is.
[115:10.06]It's like freaking me out though.
[115:17.35]Fuck, what was that noise?
[115:22.11]I guess he went this way?
[115:23.41]He went to the bathroom.
[115:32.36]I was hoping we were gonna like see him sitting on the toilet.
[115:39.16]That's too bad.
[115:40.54]I would have loved to have seen that.
[115:50.26]Okay.
[115:56.23]So now there are two in here.
[115:59.51]One over here.
[116:00.05]Where's the other one?
[116:06.93]Just move from table to table.
[116:10.21]I hopefully am not spotted with this.
[116:12.05]I think I'm gonna be fine, but you never know.
[116:15.57]Does he come back in here?
[116:18.09]I think I'm okay just to hang out right here.
[116:27.75]Oh shit.
[116:33.47]Where did the other one go?
[116:36.28]I feel like the other one's going to walk behind me right now.
[116:38.26]It's going to freak me the fuck out.
[116:39.33]I'm going to get terrified.
[116:40.69]Okay, we're good.
[116:41.29]Just don't knock anything over.
[116:45.89]Is he looking over here?
[116:47.81]Oh, fuck.
[116:50.85]Oh, fuck.
[116:56.42]Okay, we're good.
[116:56.96]We're good.
[116:57.20]We're good.
[116:57.56]Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
[117:05.18]We're good.
[117:09.82]They're a vaulting slob from Crashbox.
[117:12.76]Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
[117:15.26]Ho, ho, ho!
[117:17.48]Ho there!
[117:18.00]Ho!
[117:18.98]Come on!
[117:19.52]Ho!
[117:22.28]Put that down!
[117:27.85]Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
[117:30.49]Oh, we got... I think I have to jump from here to there.
[117:44.20]Can't move that.
[117:46.25]Put that cookie down.
[117:48.35]Now.
[117:50.43]Put that cookie down.
[117:52.03]Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[117:54.09]Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[117:57.51]What does this do?
[118:04.32]I guess you put meat in here and it grinds it up.
[118:06.74]Gotcha.
[118:08.84]Okay, there we go.
[118:10.32]Grind it up.
[118:15.52]Make sausages?
[118:16.89]He's gonna probably come pick this up.
[118:21.63]Oh, no, I have to... Alright, I get it.
[118:24.53]I have to climb on the sausages.
[118:30.00]I would assume, right?
[118:31.02]Did anything come down?
[118:34.86]What?
[118:37.94]What?
[118:40.06]What the hell?
[118:43.24]I'm supposed to make a sausage swing, right?
[118:48.99]What am I missing here?
[118:56.99]Do I have to do anything with this?
[118:59.35]Maybe I need more meat?
[119:02.04]I don't know.
[119:02.32]I guess.
[119:09.42]So here's a thing of meat.
[119:13.61]Let's drop it in here.
[119:16.29]Looks like it.
[119:18.77]Let's get it in the right spot.
[119:24.18]Okay.
[119:26.64]I just got here.
[119:27.10]Are you playing Ratatouille?
[119:28.78]Kind of.
[119:30.72]Kind of.
[119:37.47]Mm-hmm.
[119:38.15]Got to make the meat swing.
[119:40.31]Got to make the meat swing.
[119:43.50]Nope.
[119:43.82]Whoops.
[119:44.38]Pull it down.
[119:44.82]Nice.
[119:47.64]Thick cut.
[119:48.18]That's a thick prime rib.
[119:52.14]Hopefully this gives me more than one.
[119:53.34]Nope.
[119:53.70]I need more meat.
[119:54.56]Great.
[119:56.94]Well, I gotta go over here.
[120:00.43]Hey!
[120:00.59]Thank you, Lelidoria, for the 1500 bits.
[120:04.13]Just right now.
[120:05.75]No message.
[120:06.23]Just says, cheer 1500.
[120:07.47]Thank you, Lelidoria.
[120:10.27]Much appreciated.
[120:13.45]And thank you to Mick James.
[120:15.83]Mick Jams.
[120:18.53]Big ups from Canada.
[120:19.35]Well, thank you.
[120:20.50]Thank you for the 100 bits.
[120:21.68]Also, thank you to Crodon.
[120:23.44]I'm on a boat.
[120:24.04]Just thought the cameraman was drunk.
[120:27.00]What's the weather for me like now?
[120:28.22]Thank you, Spriteake.
[120:31.02]The weather's actually pretty nice recently.
[120:35.14]It's okay.
[120:38.77]Okay.
[120:40.77]I was in a Markiplier video.
[120:44.17]I was?
[120:45.89]What did I do?
[120:49.13]What did I do?
[120:53.94]Smash you.
[120:57.58]Yes, I was.
[120:58.60]I was in a Markiplier video.
[121:01.74]Hello everybody, my name is Markiplier here, and today we've got a great game coming at you.
[121:05.36]It's gonna be Five Nights at Freddy's 2.
[121:07.83]He's got a really booming radio voice.
[121:14.09]You ever notice that?
[121:19.04]He has a perfect voice for radio.
[121:26.88]What am I supposed to do about this?
[121:27.90]I don't know.
[121:35.63]I mean, I guess if I could see what the fuck I was doing, I could run and jump onto this.
[121:40.66]But I can't.
[121:42.83]Maybe I'll just open up the freezer.
[121:45.06]Okay.
[121:52.30]So, right.
[121:53.74]About that.
[122:00.40]He was watching a Try Not To Laugh compilation where he played Superhaunt.
[122:04.38]Well, I played Superhaunt.
[122:05.47]No.
[122:07.29]That game was really fun.
[122:09.94]Okay.
[122:12.16]Anybody else, like, notice, like, what I'm doing wrong here?
[122:20.19]Because, I mean, I feel like I should be able to grab something here, but I can't.
[122:27.49]No.
[122:33.62]I can't.
[122:33.94]I don't think I can do anything here yet.
[122:37.58]Try one more time.
[122:38.20]Like, up here?
[122:45.81]Okay, I can grab those, but I don't want to, like, pull myself into this.
[123:01.16]No.
[123:08.81]I don't think so.
[123:09.99]I don't think I can do anything here yet.
[123:15.87]Can I jump into this guy?
[123:20.73]I don't think I can grab this random body bag.
[123:28.16]No.
[123:33.68]Blind streamer.
[123:35.20]Wait, what?
[123:36.47]What am I supposed to be seeing that I'm not seeing?
[123:43.29]Grab that auto.
[123:46.12]That was an interesting video game.
[123:53.68]Jump onto the bag.
[123:55.52]I don't think I can.
[123:56.26]I'm going to go in the other room.
[123:57.50]I can't grab this.
[123:58.93]Not going to waste any more time in this room.
[124:00.21]There's nothing here.
[124:00.93]Not going to do yet.
[124:08.87]Hmm.
[124:09.41]Hmm.
[124:14.01]Can I climb up here?
[124:18.51]Hmm, I can get up here.
[124:19.89]Can I climb all the way up here?
[124:22.15]Hook.
[124:23.51]Ooh, I see a beat right here.
[124:26.41]Perfect.
[124:35.49]There we go.
[124:36.63]Got it.
[124:41.60]I gotta unlock the jetpack.
[124:47.05]This should be three, so I think that's enough to rope swing.
[124:54.18]Thank you to the random person that gave a dollar.
[124:57.06]Your name is not showing up for some reason.
[124:58.54]Hey, Jeremy, have you ever played through the DLC for Bloodborne?
[125:01.14]I'm getting frustrated fighting the Orphan of Kos, and you are helping me get through it.
[125:07.46]Orphan of Kos was one of the... I think I spent more time on Orphan than any boss.
[125:11.68]I didn't stream any of Bloodborne, but yes, I have played the DLC through it a couple of times now.
[125:18.12]And Orphan of Kos is just extremely frustrating.
[125:21.96]He has a ton of health.
[125:24.62]He has way too much health, in my opinion.
[125:26.80]But, you know, whatever.
[125:29.10]I think that's enough to grab onto.
[125:30.28]Let's find out.
[125:31.84]Yes, it is.
[125:38.69]Okay.
[125:40.43]Back to the vents.
[125:44.95]But yes, you are referencing Bloodborne is...
[125:49.83]I remember me and Star were sitting, trying over and over again, together, to beat that boss.
[125:56.69]And we both couldn't do it on either one of our accounts.
[125:59.78]It just got to a point where it was so frustrating.
[126:03.14]We could not do it.
[126:04.10]It was just not possible.
[126:05.30]We tried dozens and dozens of times.
[126:08.60]And then one day, randomly, I just decided to turn it on and I beat Orphan Acast.
[126:15.02]I think he did too at some point one day.
[126:16.58]I have no idea.
[126:19.76]But, yeah, he's not easy.
[126:26.52]Uh, okay, another key.
[126:32.99]Another, like, another last guardian lever to pull to open a door.
[126:40.87]Uh, okay.
[126:41.45]There's a guy here now.
[126:49.00]Okay, well, that was not what I wanted to do.
[126:51.82]At all.
[126:52.66]But, we're fine.
[126:58.88]Okay.
[127:01.12]So... Blind.
[127:06.24]This guy's blind.
[127:11.97]Wall hacks.
[127:14.01]Well, now that I know that's gonna happen, I can, like, fucking run away.
[127:16.79]Preemptively.
[127:19.51]And slide into this little canister.
[127:25.21]Into the grinder you go.
[127:26.21]Can I meat grinder this guy?
[127:27.89]I'm assuming I can.
[127:33.14]What are you, fucking sifting for gold, buddy?
[127:36.78]Cheese!
[127:40.35]Why did he need to shake the container for that?
[128:00.12]Come catch me!
[128:02.42]Haha, haha.
[128:05.42]We're up even higher.
[128:11.96]Wait, he's probably coming up.
[128:19.38]Does he come up the stairs?
[128:22.47]Which way, where does he go?
[128:29.21]Should he press... Maybe I should follow him when he presses the button.
[128:31.42]What does that actually lead to?
[128:36.36]Have I been in this room?
[128:38.00]Okay, that's just the food room.
[128:44.48]Um... What?
[128:50.57]I need... Where's the fucking key?
[128:56.81]Is this a different kitchen?
[129:02.25]This is a different kitchen.
[129:06.17]Okay.
[129:08.28]Is this a different... I don't know.
[129:13.30]Oh!
[129:14.52]That's not how you debone a chicken.
[129:18.13]Oh, the key's on the table.
[129:20.49]Guys, this guy obviously didn't watch the fucking Jacques Pepin on how to debone a chicken.
[129:23.91]Oh.
[129:38.81]Oh, shit.
[129:46.96]Oh, shit.
[129:48.14]Oh, shit.
[129:51.25]Alright, I gotta wait.
[129:51.81]When he turns around, I gotta get on the stool over there.
[129:55.83]He can't see over the table, right?
[129:57.09]No.
[130:00.07]Oh, wait, wait, he's wearing a mask.
[130:03.69]He's wearing a mask.
[130:06.95]Oh, fuck, that's disgusting.
[130:08.23]Okay, that's not his face.
[130:14.08]There's another face under there.
[130:17.68]These guys are way cooler than Mr. Longarms.
[130:24.78]That makes this way more interesting.
[130:28.66]Alright, turn around and go touch the sausage back there, man.
[130:31.28]What are you doing?
[130:33.96]He just keeps leaning, peeking corners, looking at the meat on the ground.
[130:38.75]Okay, come on.
[130:41.37]Roll the dice, random AI controller, and make him turn around.
[130:50.91]You've already done that quite a few times.
[130:57.87]Alright.
[131:00.39]Okay.
[131:02.93]Please turn around.
[131:12.04]Okay, so maybe I can't be here.
[131:15.42]Maybe he won't turn around.
[131:22.73]Maybe I should, like, lure him away, or... Maybe I fucked up his, like, pathing.
[131:28.43]Because I got, like, too far over there.
[131:34.67]I don't know.
[131:35.97]Is he gonna see me when I'm over... Yeah, he sees me.
[131:51.06]I fucking missed.
[131:51.58]He missed!
[132:06.89]What the fuck?
[132:13.24]Fuck it, he wouldn't stop doing that stupid thing.
[132:18.22]He literally wouldn't stop looking at the meat, just staring at it.
[132:23.71]Look at this.
[132:24.41]Let me stare at it and not give the player a chance to do what you're supposed to do.
[132:29.49]I have a mask on, by the way.
[132:50.52]Alright, I'm just gonna go behind him.
[132:53.67]Sounds like he shits himself every time he sees you.
[132:55.51]I know.
[132:57.39]Okay, let's fucking sneak around the whole place again.
[133:05.85]Yep.
[133:06.43]And he walks over here and he tastes a piece of fucking cheese or something.
[133:11.75]And then I gotta go around.
[133:13.05]There we go.
[133:15.81]Yep.
[133:19.25]I'm pretty much touching him.
[133:23.48]That way.
[133:24.26]Sure thing.
[133:25.24]Keep doing your thing.
[133:26.10]Do what you do.
[133:31.02]What's over here?
[133:32.66]Anything of interest.
[133:34.98]A button.
[133:36.58]Press it.
[133:41.43]Oh my god.
[133:41.99]Okay.
[133:42.13]Okay.
[133:48.92]My god, I fucking hate that so much I Hate like in physics games like this when you bump into anything and it takes like four seconds of you to like you'd be You know what I'm trying to say.
[133:58.70]I hate that Let's take the damn key and get the hell out of here Wait What is this key for?
[134:06.69]Oh right here Open open open open open
[134:25.57]It's a pretty good spot.
[134:32.62]Where did he go?
[134:33.54]I don't know.
[134:35.36]Into the fryer later.
[134:39.76]Can I play something else?
[134:40.82]No, I mean, we're kind of... We're kind of at the point where we're like, oh, we're going to be done with this game.
[134:49.11]You know?
[134:50.13]Like, this game is going to be over very soon.
[134:53.79]We're more than halfway done with this game, I would say.
[134:57.87]I guess I have to go in there.
[135:05.28]Into the trash.
[135:11.64]Anything else of interest?
[135:12.58]I don't think so.
[135:18.62]I can climb this, I think.
[135:19.76]Yes, I can.
[135:23.02]But why would I do that?
[135:31.52]How about over here?
[135:34.77]Star Wars monster.
[135:36.53]I'm not halfway.
[135:37.45]Well, whatever.
[135:37.95]I'm almost halfway.
[135:46.98]Another chef.
[135:50.97]Oh, they're washing the dishes together.
[135:53.60]That's cute.
[135:56.22]It's Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
[136:02.58]Hey, fellas!
[136:08.66]Only one of them cares?
[136:09.59]I do like the elephant noise, though.
[136:16.43]They make a really funny elephant sound.
[136:18.15]Alright.
[136:25.27]Alright.
[136:26.03]They broke up.
[136:28.75]Up here.
[136:35.68]Okie dokie.
[136:38.38]Anything of interest in this?
[136:41.92]What is this?
[136:43.58]What do I have this for?
[136:45.08]Why am I holding this?
[136:45.78]Oh, he's looking for the brush.
[136:49.63]Oh, shit!
[136:50.65]He doesn't see me.
[136:52.75]He doesn't... Okay, I took the brush from him.
[136:54.45]Now where is he going?
[136:58.69]Do I keep the brush?
[137:05.14]I think I did it.
[137:06.12]Kind of.
[137:07.94]Does he walk back to the left?
[137:15.02]Here he goes.
[137:20.44]Take this in here.
[137:22.48]Oh shit, I'm stepping on eggshells.
[137:29.08]Oh shit, I'm breaking eggs.
[137:32.03]Fuck.
[137:32.61]This way, this way.
[137:33.15]Get up, up, up, up, up.
[137:35.73]Oh, fuck.
[137:36.27]Oh, fuck.
[137:44.04]Oh, there's the brush.
[137:45.82]I was looking for this.
[137:48.10]Where is it?
[137:49.40]No...
[137:56.72]Alright, I gotta pull this.
[137:57.53]I don't know what this does.
[138:03.55]I gotta... I gotta... What?
[138:07.08]What?
[138:07.46]What?
[138:07.76]What?
[138:08.12]What?
[138:09.96]Slide!
[138:10.80]I'm dead.
[138:14.25]Maybe not.
[138:14.55]I can, like, wedge myself in the box and he won't know.
[138:23.48]He was looking for the brush.
[138:25.15]Alright, so I have to put something on this and move it all the way over, so we have to move it.
[138:28.29]Okay.
[138:30.45]So I have to move this and then hide.
[138:34.71]Get the fuck out of here.
[138:35.69]Yep.
[138:35.85]Don't step on any eggshells.
[138:39.29]Push it over there.
[138:39.91]I gotta attach something to this, whatever it is.
[138:43.02]Make it move this way.
[138:48.88]Okay, right?
[138:50.02]I guess...
[138:53.89]Do I need to move?
[138:54.59]No, no, no.
[138:55.03]I know what to do.
[138:55.91]No, no, no.
[138:56.51]I just have to hold on to one.
[138:59.11]I thought I had to put a piece of meat on this.
[139:04.50]Can I climb up here?
[139:07.56]I can't get up there.
[139:14.05]I wish I could fucking get up this.
[139:18.03]Apparently not.
[139:26.38]Oh, he can see me.
[139:30.60]Don't think he is a fucking idiot.
[139:37.32]What is he doing?
[139:41.54]Use the brush?
[139:42.46]What do you mean, use the brush?
[139:47.53]Use the brush for what?
[139:50.91]I don't get it.
[139:51.35]What do you want me to do with the brush?
[139:58.08]The brush is like in the fucking wall.
[140:06.47]Use the plates?
[140:13.85]What the fuck?
[140:18.67]Chat troll.
[140:23.28]No, I don't want to climb.
[140:24.98]I don't think I can do anything right now.
[140:29.51]He's going to come in here.
[140:33.55]Climb the plates?
[140:34.97]What are you even talking about?
[140:36.45]I can't get on those.
[140:47.35]I've carried the brush to plus 10.
[140:48.81]Climb the brush.
[141:00.08]Use the karaoke machine.
[141:01.46]What?
[141:09.25]Climb the guy.
[141:10.05]I need to wait for him to move.
[141:25.14]Use the brush to climb the plates.
[141:29.45]Hey, you don't have a brush, dude.
[141:30.43]You can't do that.
[141:31.01]Alright, get out of here.
[141:42.40]Don't, like, shove a plate up your ass.
[141:48.34]Oh, my fucking god.
[141:51.06]I can't, like, even pull myself up over here.
[141:54.53]Where is he?
[141:58.93]Why can I not get up here?
[142:00.93]I can't do that.
[142:05.17]I'm just gonna fucking run around circles and just look at stuff.
[142:27.65]Why did I just fall?
[142:30.81]Come on.
[142:31.63]Come on.
[142:32.03]Come on.
[142:32.23]Come on.
[142:32.40]Come on.
[142:32.72]Come on.
[142:32.88]Come on.
[142:33.04]Come on.
[142:36.00]Move.
[142:39.62]Steal all the brushes.
[142:47.72]I got people in chat telling me to use the brush.
[142:50.14]I'm sorry.
[142:50.78]I got confused.
[142:55.04]Is that another guy?
[142:57.16]He's going to grab me.
[143:01.45]Oh!
[143:03.27]Oh!
[143:04.02]Oh!
[143:07.48]Oh!
[143:08.96]Ayo!
[143:11.46]Why is it throwing shit?
[143:13.16]Come on!
[143:15.40]Come on!
[143:17.35]Ooh!
[143:20.71]Nice try.
[143:24.95]Alright, made it away from the fat guys.
[143:26.13]That's a victory.
[143:33.48]Alright, that's the end of the game.
[143:41.42]Now, what's the third monster gonna be?
[143:46.17]This one, hopefully, is huge.
[143:50.87]It's a bird?
[143:52.83]It kinda sounds like a bird.
[143:55.85]Where am I?
[143:57.71]That was weird.
[144:05.07]No, I want you to fucking go faster.
[144:06.79]Don't jump off.
[144:09.79]We didn't get to see them without the masks.
[144:11.15]Well, they might show up again.
[144:12.03]Hey, BF345, thanks again for the 150.
[144:17.70]Why does he wear the mask?
[144:18.58]If you take that off, you think he'll die.
[144:21.10]Always he... Anyways, he's a big guy.
[144:22.84]He is a big guy.
[144:26.22]Wow.
[144:28.96]I told you we were on a boat.
[144:31.86]I told you we were on a fucking cruise ship.
[144:37.18]It's a bunch of fat people.
[144:38.20]This is like a weird cruise where they eat people.
[144:41.66]Yeah, it's going to be one of those scenarios where, hey, we're going to go on this random species of weird alien people.
[144:49.32]They go on a cruise.
[144:50.54]They're just taking a boat bath.
[144:52.74]And they eat children.
[144:53.96]It's just like fucking Fraggle Rock.
[144:55.78]Fraggle Rock did it first, and now they're just doing it again.
[145:16.47]Well, there's the big reveal.
[145:19.51]Back to the vents.
[145:24.17]It really is just a bunch of, like, fat fucks.
[145:29.26]Where are they all going?
[145:30.18]Why are they all wearing masks?
[145:34.80]Can't wait to try the menu today.
[145:45.38]Fat shaming.
[145:46.40]No.
[145:48.62]We're just making fun of these fat people.
[145:50.96]What are you talking about?
[145:59.45]More vents.
[146:09.68]They make this shit a little too slippery, if I'm going to ask you.
[146:13.18]If I'm going to be so certain of something.
[146:15.42]The game is a little too slippery.
[146:20.51]Like maybe 5% slipperiness.
[146:24.17]It's going to happen again.
[146:25.79]Because I have to hold left on the analog and it's being weird.
[146:31.11]Wait a minute.
[146:34.03]Come on.
[146:34.59]It's not going to show me land on somebody or they're going to freak out or something.
[146:41.28]What the hell?
[146:41.88]Like, you're not going to let me... I just want to see.
[146:43.68]I want to, like, land on one of the fat people's heads.
[146:51.26]Alright, let's just go.
[146:53.07]Let's go get the twist.
[146:56.59]Let's go see the twist.
[147:04.67]Are these people wearing masks?
[147:07.01]The really fat ones?
[147:08.21]I can't tell.
[147:11.97]Oh, damn.
[147:12.37]Alright, so can they see me?
[147:14.17]I want to get on one of their heads.
[147:19.87]Well, there's, like, there's fucking Mother Goose.
[147:28.26]This is definitely going to be one of those weird, like, oh, look out, Mother Goose is evil.
[147:32.32]Now let's, come on, I have to try, right?
[147:35.06]I have to try it.
[147:35.74]That guy didn't even...
[147:45.68]That guy didn't even care.
[147:47.00]Okay.
[147:47.74]That's fine.
[147:50.79]At least have them grab you out of the air and eat you or something, right?
[148:01.11]Yeah, slip through here.
[148:06.98]All kinds of pies.
[148:08.44]I'm assuming there's another chef.
[148:10.88]Right?
[148:13.60]This is a lot of food.
[148:15.91]Yeah, but these aren't, like, children.
[148:19.11]You know what I mean?
[148:20.31]This is, like, steaks and different meats and... What the fuck?
[148:32.80]These really are just revolting blobs.
[148:38.88]I can't get on the table.
[148:40.94]Can I, like, grab him by the legs?
[148:44.98]No, I can't do anything.
[148:45.78]I'm just going to watch him eat raw meat.
[148:50.70]There's another one.
[148:54.05]What the fuck?
[148:55.93]Oh my god.
[148:56.97]Okay, that guy just ate me.
[149:01.83]That guy just ate me.
[149:04.59]That's what I was looking for.
[149:12.17]Okay, that was really fucked up.
[149:14.19]Oh, well.
[149:16.37]Hey, a human!
[149:17.97]Oh, shit.
[149:18.17]Okay.
[149:42.74]Throw the wine at him.
[149:44.32]Alright, we're done.
[149:44.92]We gotta move.
[149:51.37]We gotta move.
[149:51.93]Okay, so don't hit anything.
[149:53.19]Just sneak by.
[149:54.85]Oh, okay.
[149:55.39]He's gonna... I have to run away from this guy.
[149:57.27]Alright, just fucking move.
[150:06.96]Not a mask.
[150:08.08]That's true.
[150:08.88]Not a mask.
[150:12.77]I gotta be very careful, because if I knock into this... Does he just see?
[150:21.09]Where the fuck am I?
[150:26.52]I don't... I must just have to run by him.
[150:33.06]There's no... I don't think I can... There's nothing else.
[150:38.17]This makes me sick to my stomach.
[150:39.45]What if I just go back in?
[150:42.34]I'm just gonna go back in.
[150:43.88]I can't.
[150:49.26]Oh!
[150:50.22]Okay, we're good.
[150:53.80]Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god!
[150:57.99]Is the guy gonna fucking slurp up?
[150:59.15]Yeah, he is, isn't he?
[150:59.89]Of course he is.
[151:13.81]This is ridiculous.
[151:15.97]Look at this lady.
[151:19.61]Oh.
[151:21.45]Her neck has a neck and it also has a neck underneath the neck.
[151:28.92]Look at the guy in the back left.
[151:31.88]That dude is just cookie monstering that food.
[151:35.78]Look at that shit.
[151:40.58]Let's go.
[151:42.89]Oh.
[151:43.31]Oh.
[151:49.41]She's bent so far back.
[151:54.53]I want to like see this lady.
[152:02.95]Will she just stuff me in her mouth if she gets me?
[152:04.96]I want to see.
[152:06.86]Come on.
[152:07.98]Come on, you can do it.
[152:17.06]She's just bent backwards.
[152:21.28]Alright, well, it's alright, we're good.
[152:26.86]This is freaking me out, though.
[152:28.80]It really is.
[152:30.58]This game just got way better.
[152:32.51]Over the course of the last, like, 25 minutes.
[152:35.29]It became like a fucked up weird Wallace and Gromit.
[152:39.47]Like the Triplets of Belleville type shit.
[152:43.23]We just turned into the fucking Triplets of Belleville.
[152:46.74]Over the course of the last 25 minutes.
[152:58.92]I think I have to move the chair.
[153:04.14]Or do I?
[153:04.58]I don't know.
[153:14.66]I mean, I kinda need to know.
[153:25.51]That is fucking scary.
[153:27.99]OH Jesus!
[153:29.85]Alright.
[153:37.18]I think this is something I can get to over here though.
[153:43.00]Let me pull the chair out from underneath this guy, come on.
[153:49.65]Oh, whatever.
[153:52.13]I'm going to assume there's a secret over there.
[153:53.61]There's probably one of those dolls I can smash.
[153:56.69]Where's it going to go?
[153:57.23]Can I climb up the sausage links?
[154:01.65]I don't think so.
[154:09.39]Am I sacrificing this guy?
[154:12.93]Yeah, I am.
[154:16.16]Whatever that means.
[154:17.42]Come on, let's go.
[154:19.39]You have a place to be.
[154:20.63]No, I gotta climb up this stuff, don't I?
[154:22.35]Let me not.
[154:26.37]Come over here.
[154:31.68]Is this guy like a distraction?
[154:40.91]I mean, I do have this little guy right here.
[154:49.28]Can't move this.
[154:51.70]It's obviously something to do with you, so get over here.
[154:56.95]I have to just put this guy over here.
[154:59.21]And it's going to be a feeding frenzy.
[155:00.51]Right?
[155:08.24]I mean, that would make sense, right?
[155:12.18]Can you get up here?
[155:17.52]Come on.
[155:22.20]Come here.
[155:27.92]I need to fucking sacrifice this guy.
[155:31.29]You're getting fucking sacrificed.
[155:32.83]I'm sorry.
[155:33.35]Like, there's only one way for me to get up there.
[155:36.07]And it's you being consumed.
[155:37.47]Alright, you know what?
[155:42.52]Fuck it.
[155:43.66]I think I just have to go.
[155:47.80]Maybe I just have to sprint?
[155:51.88]Hey, Dedo!
[155:54.46]No more.
[155:55.52]Oh, God.
[155:57.46]Thank you, Dedo, for the fucking 20 bucks.
[156:01.84]Okay.
[156:08.52]I guess I'm just gonna run.
[156:17.18]Yeah, so I was supposed to do that.
[156:19.15]Okay.
[156:20.87]And jump over to the wires over here and grab them and get up there.
[156:25.80]And that's where you fucking have a shitty program.
[156:29.96]Because I was on it and then I just glitched off and fell off.
[156:32.88]I didn't stop holding R2.
[156:33.86]That didn't happen.
[156:36.20]It just literally made me come off.
[156:38.30]And now I have to do this again and I'm probably going to get grabbed from this shit.
[156:42.25]Fucking wonky ass control system.
[156:55.21]No, look.
[156:57.01]That was so hard.
[156:57.79]Okay, back up to the dinner table.
[157:15.36]Is one of these guys going to slug off the table and run at me?
[157:17.66]This guy is.
[157:20.02]One of them is.
[157:22.82]Maybe.
[157:23.10]I don't know.
[157:28.60]It's like Statler and Waldorf.
[157:30.10]Whatever his name is.
[157:30.64]Statler and Waldorf.
[157:33.86]Uh... I guess?
[157:37.30]We're going this way?
[157:38.14]Yeah, here he comes.
[157:40.22]Oh, God.
[157:42.64]Oh, they're all coming after me.
[157:45.11]Holy shit.
[157:50.83]Is he gonna keep coming?
[157:53.33]I hope he does.
[157:53.99]He's getting closer.
[157:58.70]Oh my god, this is so scary.
[158:03.30]How far does he go?
[158:04.21]Oh, he's getting so close.
[158:10.43]Oh!
[158:15.97]Okay.
[158:17.59]I don't think he can get me.
[158:18.71]Oh, fuck he can.
[158:19.71]Alright, I was hoping he was gonna... I was hoping... I was hoping he was gonna fall forward.
[158:29.84]I was really hoping he was going to keep going forward and fall off.
[158:32.38]That would have been really funny.
[158:35.62]But he didn't.
[158:36.20]It's okay.
[158:36.42]Here we go.
[158:45.63]So what is with this?
[158:46.47]I don't understand the storyline here.
[158:49.69]All these fat people are on boats.
[158:52.27]They're all coming to eat you.
[158:53.67]There's little children that are being taken by Slenderman.
[158:58.63]And... Great.
[159:06.37]Oh!
[159:07.72]His head is wedged in there?
[159:09.56]I think I can jump... I can jump over him now, right?
[159:15.24]Ooh!
[159:15.82]Okay, yep.
[159:17.80]Oh, shit.
[159:19.50]Oh, shit!
[159:22.70]Okay, I'm good.
[159:24.66]Damn.
[159:27.04]Now where the hell am I going?
[159:30.37]Just going all over the place now.
[159:33.12]Oh, come on.
[159:36.16]Fucking really?
[159:38.46]Why are you here?
[159:40.64]Why are you here?
[159:46.98]And there's just toilets in here.
[159:48.23]Okay.
[159:58.29]Well, I guess I've just got to go this way and figure out what to do.
[160:01.09]There's a mirror?
[160:07.23]Anything with a mirror?
[160:09.75]There's toilet paper in the way so I can't get under here.
[160:11.70]That's fantastic.
[160:15.76]Wait a minute.
[160:17.18]This dude's not about to use the bathroom, is he?
[160:18.66]Okay.
[160:26.74]Okay.
[160:29.02]I don't know what that was for, but whatever.
[160:30.60]I don't think there's anything in here.
[160:31.48]I gotta just go in the elevator, right?
[160:38.50]Can I go in here?
[160:39.72]No.
[160:42.26]I can't just jump up and grab the door?
[160:47.19]I swear to God, if I have to flush myself down a toilet, I'm gonna be very upset about it.
[160:57.11]Um...
[161:05.15]Yeah, okay.
[161:17.96]Oh.
[161:19.42]It wasn't a mirror after all.
[161:21.68]It was a two-way mirror.
[161:22.54]By the way, if you ever want to know if a two-way mirror, if you're looking at one just for your security, take your fingernail, go to the mirror that's in question, and put your fingernail directly into the glass.
[161:34.33]If your fingernail on the other side is touching, it's a two-way mirror.
[161:39.08]And fucking be aware of your surroundings.
[161:41.98]If...
[161:43.00]Your finger is like, you know, slightly, maybe like a quarter of an inch apart from the other fingernail.
[161:49.11]That ain't a two-way mirror.
[161:50.89]Just fucking be aware of that.
[161:51.85]In case, you know, in case you get, you know, something's happening, you know.
[161:54.11]Be careful.
[161:57.54]Uh, climb.
[162:05.66]That trick was debunked?
[162:06.74]What are you talking about?
[162:07.66]No, it wasn't.
[162:08.13]What do you mean, was debunked?
[162:14.38]I've tried it before.
[162:15.18]It works.
[162:17.37]Now, hold on.
[162:18.25]Let me explain.
[162:18.81]Let me explain.
[162:19.81]What am I doing with a two-way mirror?
[162:21.41]No, listen.
[162:22.99]At, like, the supermarket.
[162:24.15]At my local supermarket.
[162:26.05]A friend of mine worked at the local supermarket.
[162:28.03]And they had one.
[162:30.16]The employees could go behind and just, like, sit there and watch.
[162:34.78]I tried it on this because he worked there and he was just like, try it.
[162:38.26]I don't have a fucking two-way mirror in my house or anything.
[162:41.10]Everybody calm down.
[162:48.32]There he is again, slashing meat.
[162:50.77]And I'm going to fall off this because it's so hard to do this.
[162:54.53]Because I can't tell perspective-wise if I'm even still on the damn thing.
[163:03.14]So what?
[163:03.68]Oh, okay.
[163:05.64]Smash this.
[163:10.99]And let's go.
[163:14.84]Do I have to pull this, or is it just available?
[163:16.46]Alright, no, it just wants me to go.
[163:18.42]My phone has a two-way mirror?
[163:26.39]What?
[163:28.27]Wait, what?
[163:31.35]Okay, any more patrons?
[163:32.41]I'm sure there are.
[163:37.48]Of course, this guy in the weird mask.
[163:40.38]They are piling on top of each other now.
[163:46.93]This is so fucking weird.
[163:49.79]Oh my god.
[163:52.43]This is too much.
[164:04.24]Somebody just turned on a faucet of fat people.
[164:10.99]Get up there!
[164:12.41]Get up there!
[164:13.57]I just got like dogfiled.
[164:19.29]Oh god, come on.
[164:26.81]Okay, here we go.
[164:27.89]Go.
[164:28.49]They don't even want to eat me, they just want to land on me.
[164:43.06]Move, move, move, move, move.
[164:48.56]Watch out for the big... And then the meat is right in the way.
[164:50.64]Good thing it disappeared.
[164:52.98]Nice.
[164:53.48]Nice.
[164:54.20]Nice.
[164:54.48]I'm running out of breath right now.
[164:56.62]And I somehow... Somehow turned and got stuck inside of that fucking stool.
[165:03.36]My sweaty-ass thumb is sliding off.
[165:07.52]God fucking damn it.
[165:08.98]Seriously, like...
[165:15.37]Like, right now, my thumb is so far to the right.
[165:30.38]Yep, keep going.
[165:32.32]Watch out for the meat.
[165:32.88]It's gonna land here.
[165:35.09]Turn around, go this way.
[165:40.05]We're inside my palm right now, where my thumb is.
[165:56.04]Come on!
[166:08.22]What happened?
[166:09.54]Why?
[166:10.00]What the fuck was that?
[166:19.15]Seriously.
[166:20.85]I ran out of steam!
[166:22.33]My guy slowed down!
[166:27.14]When am I not supposed to be sprinting in this occasion?
[166:29.18]Like, I don't understand this.
[166:34.74]Because right now, my stamina is running out.
[166:37.26]But I can't slow down.
[166:40.22]You know what I'm saying?
[166:41.66]Like, right now I'm running very slowly.
[166:45.66]I have to, like, catch my breath right here, I guess.
[166:52.75]Okay, now let's sprint again.
[166:59.12]Got it.
[166:59.62]Okay.
[167:02.18]The same lady goes down.
[167:07.05]I jumped too early.
[167:08.41]Yeah, I know.
[167:11.05]Now I'm hungry again.
[167:11.87]Are you serious?
[167:17.57]Anybody else find it ironic that there was just...
[167:20.61]like thousands of pounds of food that I decided not to eat.
[167:27.68]It's sort of odd.
[167:30.34]You couldn't have grabbed a sausage on the way out?
[167:33.08]You could have ran with that in your hand.
[167:39.37]Alright, let's go.
[167:40.09]Here we go.
[167:40.83]Here's a sausage.
[167:41.55]I got this for you.
[167:46.38]Thanks.
[168:02.69]Well, my insatiable hunger for human flesh just decided to start right now.
[168:11.16]Thanks for nothing.
[168:16.90]Okay.
[168:18.46]This is where we get weird.
[168:27.56]That was a bit extreme.
[168:28.42]It was.
[168:31.06]Here's the last... Great.
[168:33.15]Great game.
[168:35.49]Here's the last monster, I assume.
[168:37.89]It's... Mother... Mother Maggie.
[168:46.18]From The Simpsons.
[168:52.58]It's going to open.
[168:53.08]It's going to go... She's going to go...
[169:01.77]Uh, let's go this way.
[169:10.35]I don't... I'm picking this up and... I'm picking this up and smashing the thing.
[169:14.11]What am I... Okay.
[169:24.98]I'm bringing this can of worms with me.
[169:31.06]Final area of the game here.
[169:32.90]We go guys.
[169:33.82]My name is Jerma.
[169:34.70]Welcome to the video This is gonna be a tactic and a solution of how to beat Mother Maggie from The Simpsons so as you see here I'm coming out gotta be careful cuz the carpeting in this area is your safe your safe zone So be careful of the mannequins on the left if you've moved too quickly they will follow you so if you follow me to the right here just do you want to get a little bit of a pace and
[169:57.59]And eventually here, the first monster, the eye is going to watch you up the stairs.
[170:02.97]Take a load off here.
[170:03.79]This is your one area.
[170:05.82]Over here, you saw earlier in the game when we had the Slenderman-looking monster.
[170:10.10]The key, don't worry about that.
[170:11.46]We'll find that later.
[170:12.42]Just come up the stairs on the top floor.
[170:13.86]You're going to watch to the left, and there will be a scenario that you will see unfold in front of your eyeballs in front of the television screen.
[170:22.22]So into this room, there she is.
[170:24.90]Watch out for the singing.
[170:26.44]This is the most important part here.
[170:29.28]Getting behind her is very tricky.
[170:32.16]She does one comb, two combs.
[170:33.60]You're going to wait for the third comb.
[170:34.98]That's when you go in and grab the doll off the table.
[170:40.70]And that's how you do it.
[170:54.13]Alright, let's go.
[170:58.97]Can I open this?
[171:02.73]Can this be opened?
[171:03.37]Can I throw any rocks or anything?
[171:06.54]Okay, I guess I can't go that way.
[171:11.56]Maybe I can, but let's just explore the rest of the house.
[171:13.96]That's what you want to do when you get in the house.
[171:16.28]Explore the rest of the house.
[171:20.22]I guess we do have to go that way.
[171:24.58]Okay.
[171:27.76]Maybe I do have to go find her.
[171:32.57]By the way, my name's been Jerma.
[171:34.65]Check me out sometime.
[171:36.87]I do my own thing over on YouTube.
[171:38.31]If you want to check me out, check him out in the description.
[171:41.67]Check him out.
[171:48.24]He makes videos.
[171:48.90]He's cool.
[171:49.40]You know, check him out.
[171:55.66]I do all kinds of like wacky, funny videos.
[171:58.10]You know what I mean?
[171:58.55]By the way, can I say something?
[172:01.17]If you ever describe yourself as like funny and like interesting in public, chances are you ain't funny or interesting.
[172:14.70]That's not for you to decide.
[172:17.02]You know what I mean?
[172:24.76]Should I smash this?
[172:28.44]Okay, well, let me just see what else is in here.
[172:29.90]Uh, paintings?
[172:39.28]Fucking burnt to a crisp.
[172:42.44]You say you're funny all the time.
[172:43.80]No, I don't.
[172:44.72]I've never said that I'm funny.
[172:53.75]The bed.
[173:04.32]Now that's how I would react if I heard something smash in my bedroom.
[173:07.56]I would be fucking quiet.
[173:09.78]I would go grab my bat and slowly open up this door.
[173:26.37]Okay, can she like teleport or something?
[173:34.42]She's not standing over there anymore.
[173:35.64]This is weird.
[173:43.87]She's actually going to end up being one of these mannequins.
[173:46.31]That biad just scared me, by the way.
[173:48.17]That actually scared the fuck out of me.
[174:02.94]Sit that for a second.
[174:04.10]I need to break this.
[174:10.32]Throw it.
[174:12.02]Okay.
[174:20.97]Confirm for coward?
[174:22.03]What are you talking about?
[174:22.61]I just don't want to die.
[174:24.21]I don't think she's even in this room anymore.
[174:28.95]Okay.
[174:29.07]Okay.
[174:31.43]She's going to rip off one of these things and be the person.
[174:33.93]I know it.
[174:35.57]She's going to be like one of these people here.
[174:39.36]That's why they have all these random mannequins and random spots.
[174:43.62]Because it's me.
[174:46.82]I'm one of them.
[174:52.10]She's not that one.
[174:52.92]I'm going to laugh if she's under the chair.
[175:12.51]I knew it, I knew it, I knew she was one of them.
[175:13.95]I just don't know which one.
[175:18.53]Oh god, she's right there.
[175:20.21]Yep, there she is.
[175:24.03]Huh?
[175:26.70]God damn it!
[175:28.04]Ah!
[175:28.48]I fucking, like, thumb slid off!
[175:33.50]I'm like, pushing over it, like, as... It's... I hate that.
[175:42.50]I hate needing to hold fucking right for an extended period of time.
[175:48.68]If anybody else knows what I'm talking about, please give me a hell yeah.
[176:00.19]She's gonna... Ah, I hate this.
[176:02.17]I hate that she could be any one of these.
[176:06.05]She's right here.
[176:06.83]I see the hair.
[176:09.27]You're not gonna fool me with the hair.
[176:10.57]Oh no, now they all have hair.
[176:13.20]Now you will fool me with the hair.
[176:14.30]Let's use that one.
[176:23.26]I think.
[176:24.26]Which one is she?
[176:25.87]Is she that one?
[176:32.09]I don't know which one she is.
[176:35.81]Not gonna sit around and find out.
[176:42.36]What's this?
[176:46.99]I don't even know why.
[176:47.89]I don't know.
[176:49.51]Hold on.
[176:49.97]Can I like... I know what I'm gonna have to... I know.
[176:51.75]I get it.
[176:52.13]I get it.
[176:52.61]I understand.
[176:53.55]Okay.
[176:53.93]Here's what's gonna happen.
[176:55.41]So she... When she comes out, she's gonna shoot her little fucking dark beam at me and I'm gonna hold the mirror up.
[177:00.10]It's gonna bounce off and hit her and I'm gonna fucking be able to move because she's gonna get incapacitated.
[177:03.68]That's exactly what's gonna happen.
[177:06.36]If you don't think that's the case, then why the hell would this stupid mirror be here?
[177:10.17]Yep.
[177:10.67]This is a hold it up, bounce it back at her and win.
[177:13.79]Win.
[177:17.73]Check this.
[177:20.65]Here it is.
[177:20.93]Here we go.
[177:22.41]Yep.
[177:22.97]Here's the final boss.
[177:25.14]Hold the mirror in front of her.
[177:28.64]Hey there.
[177:29.42]What's up?
[177:31.42]Oh shit.
[177:31.92]She's gonna be like behind me and I'm gonna have to fucking aim it at her.
[177:38.50]Ah!
[177:38.70]Eat that!
[177:40.32]Told you.
[177:42.54]Told you.
[177:48.63]Told you.
[177:51.37]Do it again.
[177:51.87]Come on.
[177:53.91]What?
[178:12.62]Don't worry.
[178:13.16]Sometimes it takes more than one try.
[178:19.52]I got backstabbed.
[178:22.00]Alright, we do it again.
[178:23.04]See, I know where she's gonna be now.
[178:30.93]She's right here.
[178:31.55]Got ya.
[178:35.77]There she goes.
[178:43.04]Back into the light.
[178:44.94]And then, who knows... I'm gonna just constantly... Just constantly moving.
[178:47.72]Just constantly moving.
[178:48.50]Never know where I'm gonna fucking be.
[178:52.72]Never know.
[178:53.84]Never know where I'm gonna be.
[179:01.00]Again.
[179:04.38]Never know where I'm gonna be.
[179:05.10]This is how they do it in the fucking pros.
[179:09.17]They always be unpredictable.
[179:17.82]Huh?
[179:18.94]Got it.
[179:26.97]Always be facing in directions so they don't know.
[179:30.27]Like right now, here we go.
[179:30.97]Like bang.
[179:31.75]Could be over there, could be over here.
[179:33.37]What's that?
[179:33.63]Go to the left.
[179:36.46]What's that?
[179:37.32]Could be anywhere, right?
[179:38.12]Could be anywhere.
[179:38.54]Could be anywhere.
[179:42.64]Could literally be anywhere.
[179:45.82]Got it.
[179:53.52]How many more times do I have to do this?
[179:58.80]That was a little bit louder of a scream.
[180:08.35]I win.
[180:08.77]I beat the game.
[180:09.75]Congratulations, we win.
[180:12.77]Thank you for playing.
[180:18.31]That's the end.
[180:22.61]Wait, is it gonna be like the situation where you have to get to the gun?
[180:25.25]Oh shit, I have to get to the gun first.
[180:28.47]Like every horror movie.
[180:30.45]Get to the gun.
[180:32.49]She's gonna be crawling and like, oh, get to the gun first.
[180:37.28]I gotta get to the gun.
[180:44.02]Yeah, I got to the gun first.
[180:48.30]That's not even a gun, that's a hat.
[180:49.48]Okay, just bite her neck like fucking Count Dracula.
[181:05.04]Okay, now do I become the bad guy?
[181:06.49]Is that how this works?
[181:10.23]I guess.
[181:14.39]Now I turn into the mother.
[181:25.99]I guess.
[181:26.39]I think.
[181:26.63]I'm getting fatter.
[181:38.86]I am the little nightmare.
[181:49.94]Now what?
[181:57.19]Alright.
[181:59.89]Now I'm the singer.
[182:00.85]Okay.
[182:01.21]We just walk down.
[182:01.95]We've got perfect Tim Burton piano on the right side of the piano only.
[182:14.12]Or a xylophone.
[182:14.80]That's important too.
[182:15.68]Tim Burton, right side of piano and xylophone.
[182:23.45]He's dead.
[182:31.89]Now I absorb all the fat people's souls.
[182:35.43]This is why they came on the cruise, right?
[182:38.46]Because now I get like 50,000 souls.
[182:44.39]Then I finally get my dex upgrade.
[182:48.57]Sorry.
[182:59.47]Feels kind of powerful.
[183:00.51]Alright, so now what's the, um... So, when does it... We start playing the game, like, now, right?
[183:12.03]Now I get to control and use the powers on things, right?
[183:23.46]You can't jump or anything.
[183:26.80]That's just the intro.
[183:27.62]I can leave?
[183:31.13]Where am I leaving to?
[183:32.49]There's more?
[183:39.75]Now it just turns into an open world super power game.
[183:42.11]That would be fucking hilarious.
[183:43.27]I just got a save.
[183:49.40]So I'm not sure what the save would be for.
[183:51.58]It's just an illusion.
[183:57.30]Now I'm not moving.
[183:58.50]The game's taking over.
[184:06.00]Just climb the brush.
[184:11.21]Okay.
[184:20.98]There's some meaning here, right?
[184:25.02]They never explained the mushroom people.
[184:28.34]Who are these people?
[184:31.42]What was with all the fat people on the cruise?
[184:36.29]That's it.
[184:36.57]I beat the game.
[184:42.34]So what, what, what's the, what did I do there?
[184:52.00]You are the mushroom?
[184:57.72]Okay.
[185:04.03]I'm still confused.
[185:05.19]Wait, you've been, yeah, is it... Is it some big metaphor?
[185:09.43]I don't know.
[185:09.91]Whatever it was.
[185:11.77]Um...
[185:17.51]Is there any more?
[185:18.05]There's extras.
[185:19.65]Let's check out the extras.
[185:26.43]How much was this game?
[185:27.39]Somebody check.
[185:28.38]Somebody do a check for me.
[185:29.50]A price check.
[185:35.48]Let me get a price check.
[185:44.18]20?
[185:45.86]How much was this?
[185:57.25]20, uh, it was 20 bucks?
[185:58.23]Okay.
[186:02.83]Mm-mm.
[186:04.95]I mean, I felt like, I felt like I wasn't in any real danger this whole time.
[186:14.78]Maybe, like, a couple times, and obviously, like, the big fat guys were cool, like, the whole gluttony part and the food part, there was some pretty cool shit there.
[186:23.82]Um... No, no.
[186:31.77]I mean... That was... That was alright.
[186:38.01]There's a spider on my desk I have to get rid of.
[186:39.71]Hold on.
[186:41.52]Just went underneath my iPhone.
[186:43.78]Now it's on my iPhone.
[186:45.60]Oh, this is great.
[186:46.26]Ow.
[186:51.38]Okay.
[186:52.76]Okay.
[186:54.65]I do not recommend.
[186:57.05]There you go.
[186:57.85]There it is.
[187:00.41]I do not recommend this game.
[187:03.71]Sorry.
[187:03.97]It's just the way it is.
[187:09.76]I mean, it was cool.
[187:11.40]It was cool.
[187:11.78]I thought it was interesting in a lot of places, but I don't know.
[187:16.14]I don't think I can recommend the game.
[187:25.03]I don't think the game's bad, but I don't think I could recommend the game.
[187:31.35]Especially when you put this in the same category as Inside, which was... Inside was like... It was a lot of crazy shit in Inside.
[187:40.40]I felt like I was only allowed to go, like, only in very specific places.
[187:46.28]And what I mean by that is... If you're gonna have, like, a monster in a game, like, chase you around and be scared of the monster...
[187:54.09]I mean, it really was only, like, one room you, like, avoided the scary monster in.
[187:59.19]You know what I mean?
[187:59.78]Like, they locked you in this one area, and it really was just a question of how to distract said monster to walk around said monster.
[188:08.98]It wasn't really... I wasn't really scared about anything.
[188:11.48]It was just kind of... It was just kind of abnormal, you know?
[188:20.68]I do want to get to the end of this so I can see what the, um...
[188:25.23]This is like extras, I think.
[188:26.53]I want to see what they are.
[188:33.25]Wasn't inside a side scroller?
[188:34.80]Yeah, but I feel like... The monsters were so cool.
[188:39.10]I feel like we only got to see them in very small snips.
[188:42.88]The first hour of the game was walking around and pushing boxes and stuff.
[188:46.50]And there wasn't really anything to it.
[188:53.37]Credits last a long time.
[188:57.44]How do you speed up the credits?
[189:00.34]What's the speed credits button?
[189:06.21]It's short is what the issue is.
[189:09.15]Yeah.
[189:11.03]They were just kind of getting into it with the whole second monster.
[189:14.59]The two, like, Tweedledee and Tweedledum fat people were like, that was getting cool, that was getting weird.
[189:20.23]And then that ended and you got to that whole, like, cruise ship thing.
[189:22.97]And then it's like, here's the end!
[189:24.53]Watch out for the fucking Disney villain.
[189:28.00]Watch out for, like, Maleficent.
[189:29.76]And then aim a mirror at her face four times and you win.
[189:33.68]I don't know.
[189:44.42]It was very well designed.
[189:46.96]Like, the areas were cool.
[189:51.63]Speed it up with the controller.
[189:52.71]I can't really do anything right now.
[189:54.11]I'm pressing every button I can press.
[189:58.70]When's your full gameplay walkthrough?
[190:01.24]No, I mean... How many people worked on this game?
[190:09.15]I don't mind when games are short.
[190:11.73]But I felt like I didn't really do very much.
[190:15.41]And even the cool things that played out, I feel like I was kind of in the backseat just watching.
[190:22.93]Press the power button.
[190:23.73]Okay.
[190:29.77]What about the power button?
[190:38.42]Yeah, an open storyline.
[190:41.44]Look, okay.
[190:42.36]If the story here is this open-ended interesting story, which it felt like it was, we didn't really get very much.
[190:49.69]There's an after-credits scene.
[190:56.71]Well, it sure has taken a long time.
[190:59.98]These are senior close QQC, close quarters combat.
[191:05.16]Dude, they had like fucking 15 people on the team to test close quarters combat.
[191:10.95]There's a customer service manager for this game.
[191:14.77]There are four customer support representatives.
[191:16.93]Is there like a phone number I can call?
[191:22.95]What?
[191:28.58]Assistant localization producer.
[191:32.74]Associate project manager is Yoko Ono.
[191:37.14]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[191:39.52]Like, like, like Yoko Ono.
[191:41.98]What?
[191:43.14]Hold on a second.
[191:43.96]Wait, hold on.
[191:52.90]That, that seems, that seems odd to me.
[191:55.98]If that's for real.
[192:01.06]Okay, Yoko Ono.
[192:02.10]What's the name of this game?
[192:02.84]Little Nightmares.
[192:05.94]What if that was her singing?
[192:20.35]Is this her right now?
[192:23.43]That would be so fucking funny.
[192:26.69]If this was Yoko Ono singing.
[192:32.42]Just the Yoko Ono.
[192:40.46]I don't know.
[192:43.00]That explains it.
[192:48.37]Okay.
[192:51.03]I'm going to give you the real, the real opinion on the fear right now.
[192:57.32]There were way too many people on this team for this to be like a 2 hour and 45 minute game.
[193:01.96]With like not a whole lot in it.
[193:04.06]There's fucking like, there's like a thousand people on this team.
[193:06.92]There are more people working on Little Nightmares than like fucking Overwatch.
[193:11.43]What?
[193:16.21]How can there be this many fucking people?
[193:20.81]More people are working on this game than worked on fucking Skyrim.
[193:23.41]What?
[193:26.28]What?
[193:28.99]Okay, alright, I'm gonna back up a little bit here.
[193:30.77]I'm gonna back up a little bit.
[193:33.25]The end credits theme song is not even long enough for the fucking credits.
[193:42.98]How many executive producers do you have?
[193:45.22]Like, there was a chef?
[193:46.84]Did I just see that there was a chef?
[193:50.82]Okay, I've seen executive producer like fucking 40 times.
[193:55.15]You have one executive producer.
[193:57.91]Here we go.
[193:58.27]Hold on.
[193:58.87]We got more.
[193:59.73]Little Nightmares is using Ponchion fonts.
[194:03.60]Licensed by Ponchion C. The Japanese typeface is included here.
[194:06.74]Solely developed by Dynamic Homeware.
[194:08.74]There's a lot there.
[194:09.46]There's a lot there.
[194:11.24]And fucking Norton antivirus as well.
[194:15.71]They had the whole Norton team on this.
[194:22.65]Okay.
[194:24.61]Here we are.
[194:30.26]And wait, we got... There's more.
[194:31.54]We got it.
[194:32.54]You guys thought that was the end.
[194:33.61]Nope.
[194:34.61]You just have to wait through the fucking Yoko Ono credits.
[194:40.25]Thank you for playing.
[194:46.08]Okay, what else?
[194:49.68]Back.
[194:55.62]Alright.
[195:04.08]BioShock.
[195:06.82]Alright, now let's... Here we go.
[195:08.38]Look at this.
[195:10.04]Chapters, extras.
[195:15.01]I only unlocked a few things.
[195:16.91]Okay, there's... I remember that scene.
[195:22.01]Cool.
[195:22.37]I remember this one.
[195:25.41]This wasn't in the game.
[195:27.50]What's up with this?
[195:28.76]This wasn't in the fucking game.
[195:31.69]You would have had a full letter grade higher if this was actually in the game.
[195:34.57]And you could clean a fat person.
[195:38.73]Really?
[195:42.27]Oh, god damn it.
[195:43.15]No.
[195:43.41]No credits.
[195:45.74]Okay.
[195:49.20]There's the brush.
[195:52.42]Chapter selection.
[195:57.98]I mean, it was cool.
[196:00.31]Kind of talking a lot of shit right now, but okay.
[196:02.19]I'm going to talk a bunch of shit.
[196:04.33]Alright.
[196:05.61]This whole part, this whole chapter was just, it was nothing.
[196:09.27]It was barely anything.
[196:10.10]It was opening doors and like walking in vents for like 45 minutes.
[196:15.42]This was where it started to get cool.
[196:16.84]The guy with the arms.
[196:18.42]He was kind of a bag of shit.
[196:19.46]It wasn't even that scary.
[196:21.10]Here's your meat and potatoes of the game.
[196:22.87]This is where it got really cool.
[196:24.13]This is where it got interesting.
[196:25.03]You had the two cabbage patch fat fucks with the masks on.
[196:27.89]The meat thing.
[196:29.13]It's always scary when somebody's eating humans.
[196:32.69]In this part, you got even more into the Wallace and Gromit kind of triple to Belleville weird shit.
[196:37.74]I'm really into that.
[196:39.06]These two chapters were the ones I can stay.
[196:41.12]This one could just go.
[196:43.86]I could do without this one.
[196:44.92]So, like, expand upon, like, this.
[196:47.12]And get rid of this.
[196:49.90]And then get rid of this.
[196:51.39]Over here.
[196:52.81]And there you go.
[196:53.57]You've got a perfect game.
[196:57.33]Anyways.
[196:57.73]I guess you could be a completionist and... Find all the gnomes if you really wanted to.
[197:07.24]There's nothing even in here.
[197:08.16]There's one statue.
[197:13.91]Well, there's this thing called story.
[197:15.31]Well, I mean, there was a story, but they didn't tell anything.
[197:22.57]I mean, they were telling this really cryptic story, and I'm all for cryptic stories, but when a cryptic story is cryptic just to be cryptic, and there's nothing really there, is where it's like, okay, what are you trying to tell me?
[197:35.84]People in cages, and look for the fat people at the cruise ship, and then there's a mother.
[197:41.24]And you have a yellow.
[197:42.34]Yellow might signify anger.
[197:45.32]Whatever.
[197:55.11]I'm sure you could look into it some more.
[197:57.09]Look, I don't think this is a bad game.
[197:59.97]I wish there was more to do.
[198:04.59]And with that, I'm going to call it a night.
[198:07.65]Speedrun the game.
[198:10.05]Yellow is fear.
[198:10.99]Yeah, you could do that.
[198:14.85]New game.
[198:18.22]Wait for the game theorists.
[198:19.32]I mean, this game's been out for like a couple months.
[198:22.86]This didn't just come out.
[198:27.84]We live in a world where you can get Hollow Knight for $15.
[198:32.16]Yeah, but Hollow Knight's, like, a different kind of game.
[198:33.94]There was a lot of, like, scripted events in this game.
[198:35.98]Hollow Knight's more about, like, just jumping around and slashing things and exploring.
[198:41.14]And although, yes, Hollow Knight, I would say, is, like, probably the best game to come out this year.
[198:46.48]Yeah, you can't make, like, those kind of comparisons.
[198:49.98]Like, you're talking about Hollow Knight is one of the best games to come out in the whole year.
[198:53.39]And this is just, like, a little side project of, like, Bandai Namco that they thought was, like, fun and interesting.
[198:57.67]And that's fine.
[199:03.79]But that's going to be it, guys.
[199:06.73]I will see you dudes on Thursday.
[199:09.39]And on Thursday, we're going to do one of two things.
[199:13.36]There is... I can either start Until Dawn or we can play Get Even, which came out, which is another kind of little side game, which I might be able to beat in one day.
[199:26.92]Who knows?
[199:29.31]Persona 5.
[199:29.85]I don't know about that.
[199:31.31]Those games are really cool, but I don't know if I could play them.
[199:35.42]But, yeah, we'll see.
[199:38.45]Hopefully I have my shit together on Thursday.
[199:43.87]Yeah, Get Even is the name of the game.
[199:47.15]But, make sure I didn't miss anybody on the bits front.
[199:51.19]I think I got everybody.
[199:54.35]Thank you, KillGannon, for the bits.
[199:57.61]Also, funny relatable username.
[199:59.35]Thank you for the bits as well.
[200:01.85]And with that, I'm going to sign it off.
[200:07.22]Play Persona.
[200:07.96]I don't know if I can play Persona.
[200:10.90]Not on stream.
[200:15.37]But have a good night, guys.
[200:17.03]I will see you soon.
[200:39.07]Actually, I just cut my microphone off.
[200:41.43]I was trying to say something.
[200:44.59]You don't like my taste in video games.
[200:47.05]I don't know.
[200:52.25]I don't think I have particularly great taste.
[200:54.43]I think I like certain games.
[200:56.43]I like certain genres.
[201:00.71]But, you know, whatever.
[201:04.05]Thanks.
[201:04.57]By the way, happy Father's Day to all you fathers.
[201:06.92]I wasn't here.
[201:07.42]I was in Los Angeles, so...
[201:10.02]He came back to read negative comments.
[201:11.88]That wasn't a negative comment.
[201:13.14]That was an opinion.
[201:16.88]Alright, goodnight guys.
[201:17.90]See you on Thursday.
[201:18.94]We'll figure it out.
[201:41.83]you
