[00:17.17]I mean, I got this.
[00:18.92]We'll do this.
[00:19.48]We'll do this until I don't give a shit anymore.
[00:22.44]I don't even know what this is.
[00:24.18]Hopefully I don't need to move controllers because they're not charged.
[00:30.56]If you need move controllers, I'm not going to be able to do it.
[00:43.43]Are you sure you want to start in English?
[00:45.39]Yeah, I'm pretty sure I do.
[00:53.50]Play the Zoe DLC.

[25:02.06]Yes.
[25:08.22]I felt like I was wearing socks.
[25:20.65]Like black socks.

[26:57.92]You don't have to punch.
[26:59.54]Oh, I see what you're doing.
[27:00.44]High five, man.
[27:03.16]Here, make yourself useful.
[27:16.86]This is really fun.

[27:34.09]You got it.
[27:35.79]You're fucking idiot.
[27:50.21]Oh, this is what fun is like.
[27:57.74]That was so dumb.
[28:02.76]I don't know what's happening.
[28:05.88]I lost control of the gun.
[28:10.72]I can hear it behind me.
[28:23.68]Where is it?
[28:26.14]I can hear it.
[28:38.79]He crashed.
[28:39.93]See ya.
[28:47.61]Oh, that guy's dead.
[28:50.47]So is that guy.
[28:51.27]Who's left?
[29:04.64]Uh-oh, armored car.
[29:14.48]What do I do?
[29:18.66]Gas tank in the back.
[29:24.18]Right in the back.
[29:30.43]There's explosives in the back.
[29:34.54]There's infinite ammo, dude.
[29:39.92]Come on, get it!
[30:02.60]This is like probably the most fun VR game I've played, and it's like a fake video game.
[30:18.99]Told ya.
[30:25.61]Get it!
[30:34.23]That was cool.
[30:39.07]That was cool.
[30:39.65]Get your drive!
[30:42.14]Oops.
[30:42.54]What's the big deal here, man?
[31:04.89]Car breakdown?
[31:05.43]I agree.
[31:05.61]I would add something.
[31:06.41]I just don't have anything really important to say.
[31:11.31]You're the one with all the dialog.
[31:12.75]Serena.
[31:36.79]We got Frank's beloved Serena.
[31:41.21]And he wants her.
[31:43.15]Grab it.
[31:44.29]So when he comes to get her, I'm going to fucking kill him.
[31:50.27]Damn.
[31:51.29]That's intense, man.
[31:53.15]New scene.
[31:58.10]Where are we going now?
[32:00.22]East London lockup against 658.
[32:01.66]Okay.
[32:07.09]This is long.
[32:17.36]What else you got?
[32:17.86]Another cell phone call?
[32:21.56]Can I listen?
[32:26.46]He's just pretending to be on the phone, so he doesn't have to talk to me.
[32:32.97]Sorry.
[32:34.29]Frank can't come to the phone right now.
[32:37.09]He's busy with a couple of mugs that know something about his fucking diamond.
[32:41.57]Let's have a bit of privacy, shall we?
[32:44.27]Now, as you might know, there's a lot riding on this.
[32:46.95]A lot for you personally.
[32:50.39]So do I have to get my hands dirty, or does one of you two want to tell me what the fuck happened?
[32:55.11]I don't know anything, man.
[32:57.69]I'm just about to get going on a fucking blowtorch.
[32:59.79]You've gone mad.
[33:00.47]It's not the dark ages, Mickey.
[33:02.35]Oh, Frank.
[33:04.31]Fight, fight, fight.
[33:13.25]Hey, I don't want to alarm anybody here, but you should probably put the gun down.
[33:22.00]Put it down.
[33:22.78]I'm supposed to be sitting, but I need to be fucking very clear.
[33:27.38]Don't do that.
[33:27.82]Hey.
[33:41.51]Oh shit!
[33:42.37]Oh fuck!
[33:47.75]Fuck!

[34:12.75]Oh, I almost caught it.
[34:20.18]There's a gun, there's a gun.
[34:36.29]Still got the gun.
[34:39.58]Do we?
[34:40.16]Alright.
[34:40.38]Yeah.
[35:15.88]I didn't even think.
[35:17.30]I shot that guy without thinking.
[35:25.84]Wrong choice.
[35:28.13]Yeah, that's just like default British music.
[35:38.51]That was fun.
[35:40.14]Why can't they make an entire game like that?
[35:45.51]Take the phone.
[35:46.71]Complete chapter three.

[37:18.43]That sounds fucking perfect.

[39:04.64]No, there are no consequences.
[39:06.76]It's just a dead body going down a hill.
[39:13.50]Okay.
[39:15.40]Cut it.
[39:17.40]Cut it.

[39:47.47]Let's do it.
[39:53.66]This thing's gotta get like recalibrated or something.
[39:55.58]This thing is fucked up.
[40:02.39]See what I'm talking about?
[40:03.17]Like this is all fucked up.
[40:07.19]How do I reset this shit?
[40:14.14]Press R2 to fire.
[40:15.00]Targets in red can be hit.
[40:15.96]I don't know how much longer I'm going to last in here.
[40:21.59]Scavenger's Odyssey.
[40:23.03]What?
[40:23.23]Oh.
[40:41.57]Oh, cryogen.
[40:42.40]Nice.
[40:42.78]It's going to be these two hands, right?
[40:46.50]Perfect.
[40:48.54]Going to get an injection in the arm.

[41:48.57]I am like a weird alien being, huh?
[41:52.35]Welcome back, scavenger.
[41:53.87]Looks like we're really going looting in the Forbidden Belt.
[41:58.27]Alright, fuck the story, let's go.
[41:59.45]Disembarking.
[42:26.05]I didn't do that.
[42:27.73]I thought I just did something wrong.
[42:29.05]Okay, nice.
[42:29.59]This is really good.
[42:30.45]This is really intuitive.
[42:31.23]It actually feels like it's very smooth.
[42:34.37]How do you move?
[42:55.74]Move faster by holding L1 to sprint forwards.
[43:01.99]This ship's not gonna hold together for much longer.
[43:05.09]Escape.
[43:11.66]Airlock doors have taken a hit.
[43:13.30]Open!
[43:15.52]Use the energy grapple to pull the emergency bolts off the door.
[43:19.24]How do I do that?
[43:20.94]Energy grapple?
[43:27.66]What do you want me to do?
[43:29.00]Use the energy grapple.
[43:44.21]I didn't see it.
[43:44.87]I didn't see it, alright?
[43:46.09]I couldn't see it.
[43:46.85]What am I doing here?
[44:04.79]What do you want me to do like I did too fucking much stimulation in my brain it's too much stimulation I Can't it's too much stimulation.
[44:15.20]I can't do it.
[44:16.80]It's like actually gonna make me die.
[44:19.08]I'm gonna die.
[44:19.58]I
[44:28.70]That's too much stimulation.
[44:30.72]That's a little... I'm overstimulated.
[44:32.58]Oh, God, I'm overstimulated.
[44:34.02]This is too much.
[44:34.52]Like I'm inside the movie right now.
[44:36.06]Oh, God.
[44:38.04]Oh, God.
[44:52.65]Surely not all these craft were just looking for an artifact.
[45:00.45]We're taking hits.
[45:01.73]Shields down to 75%.
[45:05.72]53%.
[45:07.54]Shields critical.
[45:08.28]We need a safe landing spot.
[45:09.90]Down to 26%.
[45:10.36]Is that a person in a wedding gown?
[45:15.38]Deploying emergency thrusters to slow descent.
[45:19.56]That was a lady in a wedding dress.
[45:23.07]Shields holding.
[45:24.29]Surface contact in five, four, three, two, one.
[45:33.90]Cool.
[45:37.42]That was really cool.
[45:38.86]That was really great.
[45:39.54]Let's go play the shark one.
[45:44.31]Lightning round, lightning round.
[45:45.33]It's about the fucking lightning round, guys.
[45:55.42]Ocean descent, danger ball.
[45:57.06]Alright, ocean descent.
[46:01.36]Wow.
[46:02.90]Of course we're doing this fucking shark encounter.
[46:04.60]Are you kidding me?
[46:08.78]Why does it think it's backwards?
[46:16.04]You see the life I have to live here?
[46:18.29]Why does it think it's... Just look all around you and enjoy the view.
[46:22.63]There's this one.
[46:27.47]Alright, shark's gonna come and jump in our face.
[46:32.35]My throat is getting a little groggy.
[46:35.15]Oh fuck, what'd I do?
[46:36.09]None of these are London heists anymore.
[46:39.93]A big shark.
[46:54.13]No one's been exactly authorized to run salvage operations in these waters, so we gotta act fast.
[46:58.87]There it is.
[46:59.39]There's a shark.
[47:01.65]No, that's a tortoise.
[47:05.79]Rookie, I'm sending you down with the recovery drones.
[47:09.16]They'll grab anything that isn't nailed down.
[47:11.72]I just need you eyes on to assess if there's anything of value once we hit bottom.
[47:16.44]You know, if you put your dad or your grandmother or something in this...
[47:23.37]They would shit their pants.
[47:26.09]It's unknown waters down there, but we'll be with you every step of the way.
[47:30.82]Alright, let's go.
[47:31.58]Get me in there.
[47:39.28]Hey, JJ, can I get a systems check?
[47:41.24]Roger that.
[47:41.78]All systems A-OK, Cal.
[47:43.26]Establishing link to salver suit in 3, 2, 1.
[47:47.58]They all got to have a boring backstory.
[47:49.72]Scopes are live and on screen.
[47:50.88]I get it.
[47:51.28]They're building lore.
[47:58.02]I need to be standing or something.
[48:00.68]Because this thing keeps going in and out.
[48:03.84]Looks like we're good to go.
[48:05.97]JJ, lower away.
[48:09.41]Can I control this?
[48:12.05]No, I can't control this.
[48:13.83]Stay sharp.
[48:15.45]We may be able to ID what's going on from drone footage.
[48:18.41]We'll relay anything interesting to your comms unit.
[48:22.07]next floor basement level did you really say basement level okay we're reading a lot of movement on the scopes you're in for a good show oh I actually get a little helmet cam here I get a little helmet light the scopes are lighting up something big definitely went down here crap
[48:51.93]I like it.
[48:52.31]Spongebob, I like it.
[48:55.08]I just saw him.
[48:56.24]I looked up, I got the Easter egg.
[48:58.06]Where?
[49:24.71]Wow, beautiful.
[49:28.89]This is just stunning.
[49:31.73]Where's my camera?
[49:34.67]You can almost smell them.
[49:42.05]It's just real sad that we'll be eating them real soon.
[49:49.77]They're so majestic, especially those like crispy fins.
[49:55.31]With beer batter.
[49:56.09]And barbecue sauce.
[50:10.13]Is it cool?
[50:10.69]Sure.
[50:11.05]Is it the best thing I've ever seen?
[50:12.51]Yeah.
[50:12.87]Yeah, it is.
[50:15.81]It truly is.
[50:20.37]Lots more debris.
[50:22.09]Something big definitely went down here, and it looks recent, too.
[50:26.11]There it is.
[50:26.63]Connor, where the hell have you sent me this time?
[50:32.88]Whoa, the seismometer's just lit up for a moment, Cal.
[50:36.28]Something's moving around down there.
[50:40.78]I can imagine the amount of necks that are in the chat right now, but I would know.
[50:46.61]I want to see the big shark.
[51:00.08]Deeper down.
[51:02.92]What's this, like, it's a small world Alice in Wonderland shit?
[51:09.82]Are these real?
[51:11.77]Who's that?
[51:12.67]It's people, like, inflating balloons over here.
[51:15.59]Is that a real animal?
[51:18.81]Oh, well, you fucked up.
[51:25.69]This is Dr. Seuss horns.
[51:28.34]That's in Green Eggs and Ham.
[51:29.50]I've seen that fucking cartoon.
[51:35.46]They're gonna... They're gonna fucking... They're gonna turn it on.
[51:40.93]The shark's gonna be right in my face.
[51:44.55]Got a jellyfish.
[51:46.67]With this one jellyfish, that means there's like a hundred.
[51:48.83]So where are the other 100 jellyfish?
[51:52.82]Oh, this might be a bait and switch.
[51:54.94]We're going to be looking at this.
[51:55.68]It's so beautiful and so awesome looking.
[51:57.22]And then Bang Shark, the light's going to come up in the back.
[52:00.48]Told you.
[52:00.92]I fucking told you.
[52:05.77]I mean, these are cool, but don't touch these.
[52:06.93]You'll die.
[52:07.99]Just if you're curious.
[52:18.65]I mean, we have pretty good Harry Potter revelation music in the background.
[52:23.04]I like it.
[52:34.28]There you go.
[52:35.62]Shark.
[52:35.82]Three, two, one.
[52:37.28]Shark.
[52:37.92]I tried.
[52:38.86]Not the crab.
[53:04.19]Where in the hell did that come from?
[53:06.39]Is it a ship?
[53:07.43]It's not on any chart I've seen.
[53:08.61]No wonder Connor was so damn cagey.
[53:12.11]Oh, wow.
[53:12.77]JJ, any ideas on the origin of that?
[53:14.37]It's a submarine.
[53:16.35]Uh, none, boss.
[53:17.13]There's no signature coming from her, and no report of anything at large going down in this sector.
[53:23.34]Guess we'd better take a damn good look at her, then.
[53:26.32]Oh, no.
[53:26.86]I don't... No, no, no.
[53:27.62]Where's the shark?
[53:30.40]I don't want to do a fucking treasure hunt.
[53:32.06]This is putting me to sleep.
[53:39.95]This is putting me to fucking sleep.
[53:52.67]So we finally hit the jackpot and she's a damn nuclear sub with no known origin.
[53:57.77]Great.
[53:59.07]Just great.
[54:01.01]Looks like Connor's got us doing his dirty work.
[54:04.38]Okay, rookie, let's hustle and get as much intel as we can on this route.
[54:07.72]No, no, intel.
[54:08.18]I'm not walking away with nothing.
[54:09.44]It's time for a start and get out of here.
[54:11.54]Now what are we doing on max dive time?
[54:13.66]Dive time's good, Cal.
[54:15.32]Radiation could be more of a problem.
[54:19.32]Shit, the seismometer just lit up again.
[54:24.37]No, no, no.
[54:27.17]Just, where's the shark?
[54:28.27]I clicked on fucking shark attack.
[54:29.45]Yeah.
[54:29.55]Just build this shit up the whole time, man.
[55:00.01]You know, don't you know the first thing about video games?
[55:02.39]No dead air.
[55:07.76]Don't bring it in my face.
[55:09.46]Are you kidding me?
[55:11.84]Oh, it's just full of fucking radiation.
[55:15.16]Let's drag it by the main character's mouth.
[55:17.07]You just wafted radiation into my... I probably don't like... That's bullshit.
[55:31.05]Hold on.
[55:31.83]We're picking up something large moving towards you.
[55:34.15]Yeah.
[55:35.13]Oh, there it is.
[55:36.49]There's the shark.
[55:41.82]Not even that big.
[55:44.74]That's not even that big.
[55:45.54]That's not even scary big.
[55:52.88]Sorry.
[56:00.37]Is there lava down here?
[56:01.39]We got to see what's up.
[56:12.66]Alright, we saw the shark.
[56:16.24]I'm just kidding.
[56:16.96]I'm not going to skip it at the shark part.
[56:51.46]Let's go to somebody's shirt.
[57:00.07]Watch out for those rocks!
[57:03.03]Watch out for those rocks!
[57:06.21]Hey!
[57:08.77]Whoa!
[57:19.42]He's a big boy.
[57:21.68]Alright, I'm done.
[57:35.27]That was fun for like five seconds.
[57:42.36]There's one more thing we have to do.
[57:44.16]It's like throw the ball, right?
[57:49.71]Danger ball.
[57:50.55]That's the last one.
[57:57.21]Danger ball!
[58:14.24]Turn your head to move the paddle.
[58:17.20]So you have to get hit in the face?
[58:24.58]Alright, this is it.
[58:37.87]What is going on here?
[58:39.55]Whoa.
[58:46.58]Oh, I get it.
[58:56.83]I got into the fucking play area.
[58:58.19]That was bullshit.
[59:03.67]I turned my head like the wrong way.
[59:04.89]Whatever.
[59:05.19]Alright.
[59:16.46]One more try.
[59:17.18]Last try.
[59:18.26]I'll give it one real go because that was stupid.
[59:44.74]How come I can't do that?
[59:45.70]Try to put spin on it.
[60:10.24]Why the fuck does he keep doing that?
[60:14.67]Stop doing that, dude.
[60:19.84]I'm trying to fucking put... This is...
[60:45.31]I mean, this is cool.
[60:46.05]It's fun.
[60:46.77]But, I mean... It's only so much fun.
[60:49.43]Until it's not.
[60:50.67]Alright, I'll win.
[61:08.74]What are we even playing to?
[61:09.74]Like, seven?
[61:15.00]I don't know.
[61:15.44]I guess five.
[61:28.47]Well, this is, uh... You know, if you could plug in two VR headsets and play this against somebody, that might be pretty cool.
[61:37.67]But that would require, like, 19 cables.
[61:42.03]And we all know how fucking fun that is.
[61:46.24]I win.
[61:46.82]Alright, that's fun.
[61:49.52]Nice work.
[61:56.94]Alright.
[62:00.86]That is going to wrap it up for tonight.
[62:03.96]Because I can only spend about three and a half hours or three hours or so in a VR headset before I need to take it off.
[62:13.17]Ugh.
[62:17.19]London Heist was fucking awesome.
[62:23.21]Oh, boy.
[62:23.97]I got mad at VR Pong.
[62:27.09]I didn't get mad at VR Pong.
[62:28.43]I got, like, irritated.
[62:34.69]Streamer Rage quits playing Pong.
[62:40.71]I mean, sort of.

[64:11.87]Resident Evil 7 DLC was pretty interesting for a free game.

[64:21.42]We're gonna start from the bottom.

[64:35.97]Otto has a new jacket now, and it's fucking perfect.
[64:38.89]It's like a puffy gray vest.
[64:41.79]It's getting really cold here.
[64:43.55]Let me move this over here.
[64:44.77]You can hear me better.
[64:46.60]It's been getting to be like 16 to 25 degrees out every day now, so it's not fun.
[64:55.52]It's not okay to be outside, especially if you're a little dog.
[64:59.53]AutoCam, I don't... He's not down here right now.
[65:03.23]He's upstairs, probably sleeping.
[65:05.97]But thank you, Alezzo Genova.
[65:08.89]Thank you also to Anzius Music for the $1.

[65:35.28]Otto got... He got here to read some bits with you.
[65:37.84]Oh, Otto wants to read bits?
[65:41.97]He's, like, not... He's, like, not about this at all.
[65:43.95]He's, like, get me out of here.
[65:45.11]I think it's because he was, um... begging for table food.
[65:50.49]Well, he doesn't get me.
[65:52.61]Oh, come here, dog.
[65:54.53]This is Otto.
[65:56.03]Who's never seen Otto?
[65:58.56]Probably some of you.
[66:01.14]Look, there he is.
[66:04.70]There's Otto.
[66:07.38]Alan showed me Midas earlier and I was like freaking out.

[66:20.64]Just reading the B-I-T-S.
[66:25.31]Otto's the best streamer?
[66:26.17]Don't fucking say that near me.
[66:31.57]I'm the best goddamn fucking streamer.
[66:35.24]Talking dog?
[66:36.22]Classic dog.
[66:40.76]Otto's a live adventure.
[66:43.68]He's gotten fat.
[66:44.94]He definitely has.
[66:47.58]Do the Otto voice?
[66:48.46]I'm not going to do the Otto voice right now.
[66:51.50]I just spent three hours in a drunk VR cam.
[66:56.67]He spelled bits I can spell.
[67:00.17]What?
[67:03.36]Ugh.
[67:04.82]You know what's weird?
[67:06.72]Coming out of that, because I didn't take a break for three hours.
[67:08.84]I was in there for three full hours.
[67:11.88]I feel like I shouldn't even be live right now.
[67:14.20]Does that make any sense?
[67:15.76]I feel like I need to open up that window and put my head outside.
[67:18.95]Outside in the cold fucking air.
[67:20.79]It's like, breathe.
[67:22.79]Breathe.
[67:27.06]uh anyways what did I just click on I don't know thank you to yeah it's the end of the stream stream's over technically thank you to captain clutch for the five dollars and eighty cents can't stay for the whole stream well you're probably not here anymore but I start my new job in the morning but I always enjoy watching the stream and hanging out with the people in chat
[67:50.40]We're glad to have you, Captain Clutch.
[67:52.67]If you're not here anymore, then maybe if you see this at some point, thank you for the $5.80.
[67:56.97]Much appreciated.
[67:58.85]Much appreciated.
[68:00.85]Scott713TF2, thanks for the $10.
[68:03.37]Hey, do you ever been a fan since your Lob Slobs video three and a half years ago?
[68:11.02]And I wanted to express my appreciation for your content with these bits.
[68:14.36]I was curious as to what games you play off-stream, if any.
[68:18.09]Also, would you consider playing Fistful of Frags or Hollow Knight again in the future?
[68:22.13]Thank you for being such an incredible entertainer and providing hundreds of laughs over the years.
[68:26.16]Thank you.
[68:27.10]First of all.
[68:28.76]Second of all, um... What do I play off-stream?
[68:35.10]Nothing lately.
[68:36.98]And that's mainly because of the holidays.
[68:39.20]Just friends and family.
[68:40.54]There's all kinds of events and get-togethers going on over the last three or four weeks.
[68:45.74]So I actually have not been playing a whole lot of games.
[68:48.86]You guys have pretty much seen me play all the games I've been playing.
[68:51.68]I haven't really played anything off-stream.
[68:55.12]Well... That's not technically true.
[69:00.42]Because I did play...
[69:03.96]I did play a little Destiny 2 for a little while with Etalyx.
[69:08.10]And then while Etalyx was here, we played... He did the VR.
[69:12.88]He did Resident Evil 7 for a little while, so... But I played Destiny 2 for maybe like 12 or 15 hours.
[69:19.94]And I was like, yeah, I don't care.
[69:21.68]It was alright, I guess.
[69:24.42]I've been grinding out Zumbinis.
[69:27.56]No.
[69:29.26]Destiny 2 is ResidentSleeper.
[69:31.71]Yeah, I mean, it's...
[69:33.96]It's, but, Resident Evil 2, this is like, this is VR syndrome, you know what I mean?
[69:39.23]Like, I'm fucking, like, brainless right now.
[69:43.13]Destiny 2 was... There you go.
[69:44.87]That's your perfect word for it.
[69:45.73]It was just brainless.
[69:47.08]You could just sit there and fucking hold down left trigger or left click on people and then pick up items and then keep walking.
[69:53.70]It was very much a turn your brain off video game.
[69:55.96]So something that was at least interesting enough.
[69:58.96]ResidentSleeper 2.
[70:01.58]Is that what I said?
[70:02.68]Oh my lord.
[70:04.52]I need to like go get a fucking coffee or something or go to bed.
[70:08.48]Either one of those two things is like ideal right now.
[70:12.12]But thank you so much, Scott, for the 10 bucks.
[70:14.86]Appreciate it.
[70:16.86]Gatorhead, thank you for the $6.05.
[70:18.87]Here's an early crimpus present for the best compact streamer on Twitch.
[70:24.75]Thank you.
[70:25.81]Appreciate it, Gatorhead.
[70:28.37]I don't say that I'm not a slightly shorter than average person.
[70:34.68]But Etalyx was here.
[70:36.90]He was here.
[70:38.82]And Etalyx is like 511 and you saw me stand right next to him.
[70:42.85]No magician's fucking secrets.
[70:44.71]You saw it.
[70:46.31]You can make your own decisions.
[70:52.29]I actually pronounced... Yeah, I did.
[70:54.47]Because I remember last time you corrected me and it was wrong.
[70:57.04]I had been saying it wrong for like the last six months or something.
[71:01.58]Gator head.
[71:02.14]Thank you.
[71:03.58]Also, thank you to Peaceful Haley.
[71:05.43]Hey, Jerma, I hope you have a good Christmas and New Year's.
[71:07.23]Well, I hope you do as well.
[71:08.63]I hope you have a good, happy and safe New Year's, happy and safe Christmas.
[71:15.63]Pleasant... PleaseNotToday gave $2.
[71:20.08]Hey, Jerma, I have a huge crush on you.
[71:22.44]You're super handsome.
[71:24.26]You should consider playing Sub Rosa with Kryken.
[71:27.79]Also, I'd love to watch you play Trouble in Terrorist Town.
[71:30.87]If you played that with friends, it would probably be a lot of fun.
[71:33.05]I hope you and Kim have a good Christmas.
[71:35.77]Thank you, PleaseNotToday.
[71:36.95]Appreciate that.
[71:40.75]I've actually been following SubRosa for a little while.
[71:43.80]SubRosa was... What are you doing in here?
[71:54.10]Why are you in here?
[71:55.06]What...
[71:58.58]Fucking cat.
[71:59.34]Random cat's in here now.
[72:02.90]Come in.
[72:03.82]Get in here.
[72:07.64]Come on in.
[72:08.18]If you want to come in, come in.
[72:10.08]Get in.
[72:10.86]Come on.
[72:16.65]She don't... She don't want to come in.
[72:20.81]Well, get in here.
[72:21.43]No, I... Alright, hold on.
[72:23.99]I gotta... She's supposed to go out.
[72:25.89]Come in.
[72:26.05]Come in.
[72:38.05]She came in here to specifically tell me that she wants to leave.
[72:44.51]She's like, hey, can you let me leave?
[72:45.93]I was like, okay.
[72:50.72]That's all she wanted to do.
[72:54.66]She actually is an orange cat, but she's not fat.
[72:57.53]She's very small.
[72:58.39]She's tiny.
[72:58.91]She's like this big.
[72:59.82]She's like a little cat.
[73:03.92]She's already gone.
[73:04.94]No, she wanted to leave.
[73:05.54]The cat, like, wanted to leave.
[73:06.60]The cat was down here and was like, hey, excuse me, can you let me out of the room over here?
[73:12.00]And I was like, alright.
[73:13.96]You didn't want to be in here.
[73:14.64]You don't want to hang out.
[73:15.36]It's not Garfield.
[73:16.85]It's a compact Garfield.
[73:18.95]There you go.
[73:19.49]There's your joke for, like, the next, like, six years.
[73:22.67]You got, like, a six and a half year joke from that.
[73:25.61]It's a compact fucking small Garfield.
[73:28.01]And, of course, Jeremy will have, like, the small Garfield, right?
[73:31.93]Come on, let's hear it.
[73:33.76]Put it on Reddit.
[73:35.22]Tweet me fucking 100 times a day.
[73:38.68]Send me some, like, Photoshop pictures with, like, my face on that cat.
[73:47.34]Just like their owner.
[73:48.26]There it is.
[73:48.86]Yeah, yeah, there it is.
[73:49.94]You guys are fucking assholes.
[73:58.62]I'm just kidding.
[73:59.26]I love you guys.
[73:59.76]You guys are fucking great.
[74:01.14]Anyways.
[74:02.80]Thank you to... Thank you to Tot.
[74:07.13]No, no, no, no, no.
[74:07.79]Hold on.
[74:07.97]There were a couple more here.
[74:10.45]Where was I?
[74:11.25]Oh, please not today.
[74:11.95]Thank you.
[74:12.35]Please not today.
[74:12.93]That was the... That was the person that said to play Sub Rosa with Criken.
[74:17.44]I've been following Sub Rosa.
[74:19.76]Looked like it was a funny game, but it was like perpetually not released.
[74:23.58]And I just forgot about it, so... Maybe we will.
[74:26.62]Maybe I'll hit him up.
[74:27.50]I don't know.
[74:29.03]There is no schedule of when I play with certain people.
[74:33.91]We're just kind of like, hey, do you want to do it?
[74:35.33]I guess so.
[74:35.95]Maybe we'll do it next week.
[74:36.95]Alright.
[74:37.39]I'll hit you up and we'll talk.
[74:39.58]It's not really much more than that, to be honest.
[74:42.72]But Rampaging Scrub gave $50.
[74:45.06]That was a long time ago.
[74:49.53]About two or three hours ago, they gave 50 bucks.
[74:51.71]So, Rampaging Scrub, thank you for the 50 fucking dollars.
[74:54.57]And they say, jermaJup 3, jermaJup 4, Holiday Cheer, 5,000.
[74:59.25]So, there was like a, I think there was like a Jupiter, there was a middle Jupiter there with Holiday Cheer.
[75:06.38]So, thank you so much, Rampaging Scrub.
[75:10.72]That's very, very kind of you.
[75:13.09]Official Ponystar, thanks for the $1.
[75:14.31]Don't put next.
[75:16.19]I beat the whole thing.
[75:17.20]Didn't next it.
[75:18.46]Thank you, Tot, for the $4.
[75:20.74]Fucking next, dude.
[75:24.00]Did everybody just hate that Resident Evil 7 DLC?
[75:27.30]Did everybody just fucking hate that or something?
[75:29.88]What was so wrong with it?
[75:31.05]Everybody fucking hated it.
[75:34.39]It was a cute little free game.
[75:38.99]Yes.
[75:39.85]Really?
[75:40.37]Everybody fucking didn't like that?
[75:44.17]It was okay.
[75:46.33]Not really.
[75:46.93]It was... It was kind of boring.
[75:51.52]Damn.
[75:52.56]I didn't even know.
[75:53.34]I was inside of the machine.
[75:57.02]Well.
[75:58.05]It's done now.
[75:58.75]You won't see it again.
[76:01.89]Hey, look, if we didn't play Resident Evil 7, that means we wouldn't have been able to do the London heist, which was absolutely the funnest part of the whole stream for me.
[76:10.62]That was like the best part of the whole stream.
[76:12.22]If we didn't do that first, we wouldn't have an opportunity to play that.
[76:17.40]Come on.
[76:17.89]Give me a break.
[76:21.09]Close the game?
[76:21.95]Oh, this thing's been on the whole fucking time?
[76:23.75]What the hell?
[76:24.19]It's true.
[76:27.99]It's true.
[76:30.32]Anyways, thank you to Darkstar7000 for the $2.50.
[76:34.52]Jingle Bells, Jerma Smells, Burger is the Egg, VR Stream lost its steam and Etalyx got away.
[76:43.07]That's another Resident Evil 7 joke.
[76:49.69]Damn, alright, I guess Resident Evil 7 is just kind of nobody cares anymore, I guess.
[76:55.31]I still thought it was alright.
[76:59.26]The game music's in the background.
[77:00.32]I muted it.
[77:00.94]You can't hear it.
[77:03.48]Official Blue Apron, thank you for the pretend sponsorship.
[77:08.92]Thanks for the bits too.
[77:09.78]As long as Twitch keeps letting me watch interactive ads, I'll keep getting you to advertise Blue Apron.
[77:15.21]A better way to cook.
[77:19.19]But you're not real though.
[77:20.37]You're not like actually from Blue Apron.

[77:54.53]Actually, I did do that.
[77:58.22]That did happen.

[84:12.11]One of them was broken.
[84:12.89]Remember I remember Etalyx held it up and I like I punched through one.
[84:16.13]I don't know which one it was.
[84:17.07]I think they were both his paintings.
[84:19.03]So I think I still have my paintings.

[84:24.06]Do I?
[84:24.36]I don't know.

[84:27.86]Maybe I would do something like that for fun.
[84:29.96]Do it like for charity or something.
[84:32.90]But thank you, Stix.
[84:34.60]Tabby256, thanks for the $10.
[84:38.22]Hi, Jerma.
[84:38.72]It's my birthday today and I caught your stream just in time.
[84:42.07]I'm a long time watcher and you've given me so many laughs and good times over the last four years.
[84:47.53]Thank you so much.
[84:49.01]Keep being you.
[84:51.23]Thank you for the $10, first of all, Tabby.
[84:54.45]Second of all,
[84:57.73]This is for you.
[84:59.73]None of this happens without you.
[85:01.37]None of this happens without you.
[85:03.33]Without you, this is no longer happening.
[85:07.06]So, give yourself credit.
[85:10.46]Because if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be doing it.
[85:13.06]Thank you so much.
[85:15.08]For the ten fucking dollars.
[85:18.22]Rolly Polly, thanks for the one dollar and fifty cents.
[85:20.11]Notices bulge.
[85:21.39]Oh my fucking god.
[85:25.69]Thank you, Toby, for the $2.
[85:27.42]Do you prefer your yucky sand to be dried or moist?
[85:31.30]Moist.
[85:32.42]Moist sand is way better.
[85:34.48]It feels nicer.
[85:35.62]It kind of feels like floam.
[85:36.74]It's not gross.
[85:38.42]Dry sand feels like dust and like it feels like an old sneeze.
[85:41.47]I don't like it.
[85:43.83]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $1 total.
[85:47.07]And you say, OWO, so you're not ruling out Rat Movie VR.
[85:50.71]No, I'm not.
[85:52.51]Maybe we'll do it one day.
[85:55.09]And only four more to go.
[85:56.51]We got Hi Lord Nameless for the 50 cents.
[85:58.75]Where's the damn Jerma apparel?
[86:00.91]Showed my friend your content and he loves it.
[86:03.32]Wanted to surprise him with a priceless gift.
[86:05.52]Holiday cheer, 50.
[86:06.52]There might be something super, super cool soon.
[86:23.03]Shirts and emotes.
[86:27.55]Gonna do something weird.
[86:31.24]Been talking to some mods about it.
[86:35.00]You'll see.
[86:37.04]Hopefully before the new year I can figure out that shit.
[86:42.11]Hopefully soon.
[86:43.73]If it ever ends up actually fucking happening.
[86:48.91]Uh, never trust a purple.
[86:49.89]Thank you for the $5.
[86:51.25]Can we please get cheese nips, cheese it, and antidote emotes?
[86:56.57]Uh, I'm not sure I can do that.
[86:58.47]I probably like can't put those through to Twitch.
[87:01.35]I'm sure they would reject them.
[87:02.37]They'd be like, uh, no, you don't, you can't like have like cheese it's like the cheese nip brand.
[87:07.91]Like that's not going to happen.
[87:09.35]I'm sure they would immediately reject it, but we could try.
[87:13.35]Thank you.
[87:13.89]Mostly lost for the $1.
[87:14.85]Five more LUL.
[87:20.97]Darkstar7000, you missed two of my bits, meme streamer.

[87:54.14]Colla- What collateral?
[87:58.56]Did we get like in a superhero fight and like break a bunch of buildings and shit?
[88:03.75]No, is that collateral?
[88:04.51]What is that?
[88:05.19]That's collateral damage.
[88:06.01]Yeah, it is.
[88:06.55]Okay, just making sure.
[88:08.35]Make sure I have my fucking superhero terms right.
[88:11.97]Melancholy, thank you so much for $100.
[88:16.69]I'm not sure how long ago is not long ago.
[88:19.45]But regardless of how much time you've been here, it's never, ever, ever expected for somebody to do that.
[88:25.89]So thank you so much, dude.

[89:58.58]I know we're still about a week and a half out, but have a good holiday.
[90:03.10]For some reason, you do not see this stream again.
[90:07.32]Dearly beloved, thanks for the three bucks.
[90:09.78]Hey, Jerma, went through a bad breakup a couple months ago back and have been regularly watching your stream since.
[90:15.54]It's not much, but you help a lot through some bad times and I wanted to give back a bit.
[90:21.19]Thanks for being here and being you.
[90:23.71]Hope you feel better.
[90:26.07]It's not easy to do shit like that.
[90:28.59]Bad breakups.
[90:30.67]They stay with you for a while, especially when you have trouble getting over them.
[90:34.03]So hopefully you're getting over it healthily, healthily, healthily is what I'm trying to say because it is not easy.
[90:43.72]So if I can, if the chat, if the Discord, if I can be here to alleviate some of that pressure of getting over a relationship, then, you know, glad to be here.
[90:56.01]I'm sure a lot of people would say the same.
[90:58.62]But good luck to you.
[90:59.54]Thank you so much for the $3.
[91:02.26]Thank you.
[91:04.62]And with that, Scott713TF2, thanks for the bits, and RolyPoly, thanks for the bits.
[91:11.32]And SirFeline, thank you for the bits as well.
[91:15.02]Have you considered playing Dead Cells?
[91:16.76]Probably not.
[91:18.41]It's not really my type of game.
[91:21.75]Although I wouldn't be opposed to playing it.
[91:24.15]I just don't think I would stream it really at all.
[91:26.25]But, you know.
[91:28.92]And, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the stream.
[91:35.34]Thank you for coming and hanging out to this VR stream.
[91:37.54]I'm sure I'll be in the shower folding hairs out of my hair.
[91:43.07]And we'll just accelerate our balding process as fast as we can, right?
[91:50.81]But,
[91:53.85]Have a good night.
[91:54.88]I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[91:55.80]I'm not sure what we're going to do on Sunday, but if for some reason there's no stream on Sunday, then I might have to push it to Monday.
[92:05.58]I'm not sure.
[92:06.08]I don't think I'm going to have to do that, but you should see me on Sunday.
[92:10.24]I will let you know.
[92:12.11]Thank you.
[92:12.51]Take care, everybody.
[92:14.63]God bless you.
[92:16.49]Or if you don't believe in that,
[92:19.77]Gesundheit.
[92:20.47]Because, like, fucking bless you.
[92:21.81]You know what I mean?
[92:22.35]Like, bless you.
[92:23.33]Like, if you fucking are chewed.

[92:33.62]Thank you so much.
[92:35.44]Take care, everybody.
[92:36.56]See you soon.
[92:38.12]Much love.
[92:45.76]Give a time?
[92:47.28]I can't give you a time.
[92:48.82]It's definitely going to be at some point on Sunday afternoon.
[92:52.89]Not on Sunday morning.
[92:55.47]It's going to be Sunday morning.
[92:57.41]No, it's going to be Sunday afternoon between like 3 p.m.
[93:03.12]and like 7 p.m.
[93:04.90]Somewhere in there.
[93:05.86]Or Monday between like 4 p.m.
[93:08.52]and like 8 p.m.
[93:10.80]Somewhere around Sunday to Monday.
[93:15.95]Applying people with ADHD can set schedules.
[93:19.17]It's fucking impossible.
[93:24.83]Why?
[93:25.13]What do you mean why?
[93:28.21]Between you vague potato.
[93:31.88]I don't know because I don't like given times anymore because I can never meet them.
[93:36.79]Like, even today.
[93:37.41]Today's a scheduled stream.
[93:39.65]And I sat down and I was like, I started at like 7.50 because I had to download four updates for my piece of shit VR.
[93:48.56]I don't have a clock in my house?
[93:54.26]I actually don't have a clock in my house, you're right.
[93:56.24]That's not a joke.
[93:57.96]There is not a clock in my house.
[94:00.58]I just look at my phone.
[94:04.70]Good night, everybody.
[94:06.62]See you soon.
[94:34.86]Thank you.
