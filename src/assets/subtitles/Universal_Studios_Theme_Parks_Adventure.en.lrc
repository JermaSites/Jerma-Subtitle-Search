[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.58]Okay, so I have a couple of options here that I think we could pivot to that would be fun.
[00:06.82]I don't know which one to do because there's this very real possibility that one of the two of these things that I want to just throw in here are going to be so bad.
[00:16.67]I'm not sure which one.
[00:20.91]I have Universal Studios Ride the Rides for GameCube.
[00:25.51]I don't know why I bought it.
[00:26.77]I don't even know how I bought this.
[00:31.11]Or another Cooking Mama game that was on the Wii.
[00:36.62]The Cooking Mama 2 for the Wii.
[00:38.90]And then go to Animal Crossing in another couple hours.
[00:43.98]I'm not sure which one of those I want to do right now, but they both sound very interesting to me.
[00:49.84]Should we ride the rides at Universal?
[00:53.78]Universal Studios?
[00:55.08]Look,
[01:02.07]I'm just looking up GameCube games that look like they could be fun and interesting.
[01:07.95]And I'm like, when am I going to have an opportunity to play this fucking game?
[01:11.05]Ever.
[01:13.07]Because this is a game that I will never play for more than an hour or two.
[01:18.58]So, seems like a pretty good spot for it.
[01:26.30]Right now.
[01:28.21]And look, if this game is absolute dog shit, then we can just keep moving around.
[01:35.77]I'm open today.
[01:36.43]I'm open to whatever.
[01:38.83]But this is all already set up, so it's gonna have to be something for the GameCube or the Wii.
[01:44.06]We want to go on rides?
[01:44.94]Okay.
[01:46.62]Let's go on some rides.
[01:52.78]We might have to do some changing of the audio.
[02:01.72]Let's see.
[02:03.90]Do we have to do any changing of the audio?
[02:12.34]Universal... This game is not a true representation of Universal Studios theme parks.
[02:15.56]What?
[02:16.98]I missed... Oh, I missed $50 bits.
[02:19.16]Holy shit.
[02:21.24]5,000 bits from Phylactery Lich.
[02:22.79]That's 50 more bucks.
[02:25.35]Please, play Gacha Force, you sexy BLT clown.
[02:28.69]Gacha Force is probably going to be like a 10 hour stream.
[02:32.03]And that was not on the plans for today.
[02:33.54]This is going to take too long.
[02:42.52]This is fucking loud.
[02:47.56]Oh, there he is!
[02:49.98]Wait.
[02:51.46]Why is he in there?
[02:54.30]Why is he in there?
[02:56.88]Are we going to get a... Please be the person that takes us around the whole park.
[03:03.69]There's no dialog.
[03:08.31]Are you guys ready to ride these rides?
[03:22.17]This game's gonna be very bad.
[03:23.27]I can already tell.
[03:30.03]You know, in hindsight, I'd like to uncheck the box when this is in my cart.
[03:38.36]To remove it from my cart.
[03:41.29]But I can't do that.
[03:48.56]Alright, you ready to test the audio?
[03:49.50]We're gonna do some audio testing here.
[03:50.72]Ready?
[03:50.92]Boom.
[03:53.23]Boom.
[03:55.75]Boom.
[03:58.79]Boom.
[03:59.51]Oh, shit.
[04:00.27]Boom.
[04:02.85]Boom.
[04:05.15]It's alright.
[04:10.43]Just skip and play Cooking.
[04:11.67]How is this game hard?
[04:16.77]Rumble feature.
[04:17.39]I don't know.
[04:17.69]I hate Rumble.
[04:19.81]Universe Studios Theme Park Adventure Name, what's your name?

[08:43.32]E.T.
[08:43.72]is in trouble.
[08:45.36]He has to go back to the green planet and there's hardly any time before the spaceship takes off.
[08:51.56]You need to hop on the bicycle and take E.T.
[08:54.34]to the spaceship.
[08:56.16]On the bicycle, press the A button to pedal and the B button to brake.
[09:01.25]Steer the bike by moving the control stick up and down.
[09:04.91]Do a wheelie by moving the control stick to the left.
[09:09.32]I didn't get any of that I don't know how this works I don't know how to play the game all I heard was somebody sticking a needle into my ear and hitting like the right side of my brain
[09:39.32]Wait, I actually have to do- this is not how the ride works.
[09:42.68]I thought I was just gonna ride the ride.
[09:44.02]Wait, it like put me in E.T.

[10:20.24]Alright, to be fair, I used to do that shit all the time on my bike.
[10:24.64]Even when I wasn't rushing to deliver an alien to his spaceship.
[10:28.44]Oh my god.
[10:40.47]This ride sucks.
[10:43.37]This is really sh...
[10:47.11]What a shitty ride.
[10:48.59]Hey, kid!

[10:53.25]You have four minutes to ride a regular bike down the street!
[10:58.71]Cool!
[10:59.38]I have three and a half minutes to get there.
[11:12.04]How do I speed up?
[11:19.00]At what point is there adult intervention?
[11:22.89]He keeps falling down.
[11:25.53]But now they're trying to kill him.
[11:28.73]Crunchy.
[11:46.29]This is fucking terrible.
[11:49.30]I need to... Hold on.
[11:50.26]We're getting into the hard part.
[11:54.04]Holy shit.
[11:55.48]They're dropping the... They're doing, like, Bowser.
[11:57.78]Every Bowser boss fight.
[12:05.53]All again, Jerma.
[12:06.25]It's funny.
[12:07.45]I'm just pedaling, dude.
[12:12.55]I'm gonna get there.
[12:14.62]By the way, somebody said they guarantee I don't... They guaranteed I don't beat the first level.
[12:18.90]Somebody said that.
[12:19.44]I want to make sure that that's on the line now.
[12:41.76]This is...
[12:45.12]He actually did it, yeah.
[12:48.80]We're almost at the end.
[12:49.38]I have two minutes to get, like, 15 feet.
[12:53.66]It's not over yet.
[12:54.46]I know.
[12:54.72]I can't see.
[12:55.56]This is a loading spring.
[12:59.91]Yeah, it was a loading spring.
[13:01.15]Did I go over this?
[13:07.65]Go!
[13:13.04]Okay, I will tell you, I promise, if the next level is this exact same level, this exact same game, with a different coat of paint on it, it's a side-scrolling racer, with a goal at the end, if that's the next game, I will take the disk out immediately and I will throw it away.
[13:32.22]Okay?
[13:33.70]I promise.
[13:40.74]I have a recycle.
[13:41.70]I have a recycle disk.
[13:43.12]If that's the case.
[13:49.47]Eat the disk.
[13:50.37]No.
[13:50.59]Alright, how did it end?
[14:01.62]Is this a ride?
[14:02.92]Or is this a really, really, really rich kid's expensive birthday party?
[14:12.44]This is all for me.
[14:13.34]Holy fuck, man.
[14:19.00]It took some of you motherfuckers an hour to do this?
[14:21.44]59 minutes?
[14:34.21]That's impossible.
[14:35.07]That's not even possible.
[14:36.85]Some?
[14:37.61]All, actually.
[14:38.35]All.
[14:38.93]Did I get a stamp?
[14:41.68]Oh, we can do a quiz.
[14:43.55]Alright, I got the E.T.
[14:44.15]stamp.
[14:44.41]Alright, I'm not done.
[14:55.41]Is there a map?
[14:57.87]Maps.
[14:58.71]Where's map item?
[15:03.09]Is there a map?
[15:04.31]Can I go in the mailbox?
[15:07.13]Go do Jurassic Park?
[15:08.25]I mean, I have no idea where to even go.
[15:10.23]I'm like a lost kid.
[15:13.74]Motion picture.
[15:14.80]Magic.
[15:15.96]What is this thing?
[15:16.62]Can I do this one?
[15:21.85]Press tab, noob.
[15:22.89]There's no tab on a GameCube.
[15:26.91]Wait, somebody wanted to talk to me.
[15:27.95]What do you want?
[15:31.29]Someone was handing out maps at the park entrance.
[15:42.75]I mean, he looked.
[15:43.87]Looked at what?
[15:45.77]Alright, there's the park entrance right here.
[15:46.99]Where are the maps?
[15:50.41]Map!
[15:50.61]Do you have a cap?
[15:52.03]You can enter some attractions whenever you want if you have a cap.
[15:57.61]What the fuck are you talking about?
[16:02.63]This music, not like this.
[16:04.27]Alright, give me a map.
[16:09.38]Hello!
[16:11.48]There are letter tiles hidden inside the park.
[16:14.59]You'll receive a stamp if you collect all the tiles.
[16:16.41]You'll earn points if you click.
[16:18.25]Uh-huh.
[16:21.16]Alright, Woody, give me a map.
[16:23.96]Right now, every attraction is at full capacity and nobody can get in.
[16:27.24]I'll give you this E-Pass.
[16:29.14]You can only have one E-Pass, but you have priority to enter any attraction that you want.
[16:33.86]So if you decide to use your E-Pass, choose the attraction wisely.
[16:38.49]What?
[16:38.73]I have to use an Express Pass?
[16:41.69]I want to exchange my points.
[16:52.90]E-T-Cap.
[16:55.63]T-Rex shoes?
[17:00.72]No, no, no, no, no.
[17:01.48]I want to come back.
[17:02.14]This is just Animal Crossing, yeah?
[17:06.32]Where's the entrance to this park?
[17:07.52]Somebody has a map for me.
[17:10.49]Overpoint's 40,000 points.
[17:12.73]Get the fuck out of here.
[17:16.23]Unlock everything.
[17:17.45]I'm not going to do that.
[17:22.44]Where do I get this map?
[17:24.86]I heard somebody was handing out maps at the entrance.
[17:26.92]Well, where the hell are they?
[17:32.29]Is there a sprint?
[17:37.17]Can I go right?
[17:38.35]No.
[17:40.09]I'm just going to keep following the road.
[17:41.83]What's the worst that could happen?
[17:44.63]Right?
[17:44.83]What do you mean?
[17:45.37]There?
[17:45.51]There?
[17:45.75]Right there?
[17:46.37]Where?
[17:49.21]Who has a map?
[17:49.63]Who has a map?
[17:53.41]Who's going down the road?
[17:56.65]You're gonna get hit by a truck.
[18:02.14]Do you have a map?
[18:03.62]No!
[18:03.96]Okay, I don't have a map.
[18:05.16]If you don't have a map, get one back at the park entrance.
[18:48.31]The red lady?
[18:51.53]Nobody has a map.
[18:54.43]There's no- This lady?
[18:56.71]This lady didn't- Hey, hello.
[18:58.23]Nobody has a map, guys.
[19:00.13]Nobody has a fucking map.
[19:02.67]Red to lady.
[19:03.51]This is a blast.
[19:05.23]I'm having so much fun.
[19:08.05]I need an- I need an adult to help me do this.
[19:10.65]Where's their- I'm at the park.
[19:12.02]This is the park entrance right now.
[19:13.78]Red.
[19:14.86]Do you know where you're going next?
[19:16.46]I don't know.
[19:19.30]I don't know where to go.
[19:19.98]Help!
[19:22.98]Which attraction should I go see now?
[19:24.42]I don't know.
[19:24.80]I need help.
[19:26.54]I'm lost.
[19:28.12]Wait, I can go down here.
[19:28.92]Wait.
[19:32.20]Just get the shit out of me.
[19:47.42]Map.
[19:47.62]Alright, this is the park entrance.
[19:51.16]I'm supposed to go into the fucking parking lot.
[19:55.55]Where is the map person?
[19:58.11]I'm in the parking lot!
[20:03.87]Do you have maps?
[20:06.62]The weather is always nice.
[20:10.18]Don't leave.
[20:11.16]I'm not gonna just leave.
[20:13.34]You think this kid has enough to, like, survive walking down?
[20:16.98]No, he's got, like, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and, like, Ritz crackers in his backpack.
[20:21.28]I'm not, Lee, I'm not going anywhere.
[20:22.58]This map doesn't fucking exist.
[20:36.19]It doesn't.
[20:36.49]I just have to walk to the next ride.
[20:40.24]I'll just walk into the next row.
[20:41.20]I don't even care what it is.
[20:41.96]Do you have a Ritz sponsorship?
[20:44.80]No, but they're fucking utterly delicious.
[20:49.26]When you put a Ritz cracker in your mouth, you can eat them by themselves.
[20:53.14]Wait, am I blind again?
[20:54.00]The guy in blue.
[20:54.86]What?
[20:58.54]Here, have a map.
[21:07.03]Alright, we're going to...
[21:09.62]We're going.
[21:10.08]Here we go.
[21:13.41]When you put a Ritz cracker in your mouth, this shit disintegrates.
[21:16.64]It's so buttery and flavorful and it just disintegrates in your mouth.
[21:20.34]You put one little cube of cheese on it.
[21:23.76]You put a piece of salami on it.
[21:26.64]Ritz crackers are seriously some of the best snack you could ever have.
[21:30.52]You can eat them by themselves.
[21:32.38]They're fulfilling.
[21:33.26]They're satisfying.
[21:35.32]I fully endorse Ritz crackers for a snack president, I guess.
[21:46.89]Alright, where am I going?
[21:47.49]Alright, let's go this way.
[21:56.55]I got it!
[21:58.94]I-L.
[22:00.68]Oh, what's that up there?
[22:04.86]New ride.
[22:05.38]It's not even a ride.
[22:12.51]It's not even a ride.
[22:17.91]Got it.
[22:21.33]Can I find something?
[22:22.44]Can I please?
[22:29.92]I think I found something.
[22:33.44]Jaws.
[22:33.88]Alright, let's get on Jaws.
[22:40.21]You can't enter this attraction because there are too many people.
[22:44.49]Wait, you have an E-Pass.
[22:51.24]Let me know whenever you want to try this.
[22:53.84]Just wait in line?
[23:10.14]I can go once.
[23:12.18]Alright, let's fucking go.
[23:13.18]Jaws, this is going to be the coolest one.
[23:16.40]Let's go.
[23:17.76]I'm going to Jaws.
[23:24.06]From the movements to the voice to the... I feel like this is a VRChat avatar.
[23:51.35]If you're about to fall off the boat, push the A button repeatedly to get back on the deck.
[23:57.49]Stop Jaws before he sinks the ship.
[24:03.69]I don't even know how to play.
[24:04.75]I have no fucking idea.
[24:08.57]A and B?
[24:09.37]Wait, I'm Jaws?
[24:10.53]Alright, let's go.
[24:13.95]Pick up barrel.
[24:15.33]And throw barrel at Jaws.
[24:26.77]Get out of here.
[24:31.33]Oh shit, he took a bite.
[24:49.54]Uh, starboard, right?
[24:54.34]Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!
[25:02.23]Oh my god he's gonna eat me!
[25:05.37]Oh shit a kid fell off on the Jaws ride turn it off!
[25:24.90]Is this not even hitting him?
[25:27.60]How do I open shit?
[25:28.94]Can I open these boxes?
[25:32.60]He's wrecking the boat.
[25:33.46]Yeah, I mean, I have to hit him with these things, but he keeps... That was so dumb.
[25:59.08]Come on.
[25:59.56]Come on.
[26:00.10]Come on.
[26:00.74]Come on.
[26:01.22]Do it again.
[26:12.60]I'm running out of Donkey Kong barrels to throw at this guy.
[26:31.44]Are the yellow ones worth more damage or something?
[26:49.82]Imagine ping.
[26:52.11]Like, a hundred and fifty million dollars to license all the shit in this game?
[26:56.63]And you throw boxes of Jaws off the boat?
[26:58.70]I have thirty seconds to continue.
[27:25.19]Wait, which one's selected?
[27:25.99]Alright, here we go.
[27:28.71]I'll get it.
[27:31.05]Now I understand the mechanics.
[27:36.03]I don't know if it was, like, depressed or not.
[27:46.93]Please, no more.
[27:47.69]No, no, no.
[27:47.93]I'm not done.
[27:48.35]I'm not done.
[27:50.87]I'm not done.
[27:58.25]Please no more.
[28:03.78]That zoom in on his face.
[28:06.60]That perfect zoom in with the thing hitting him in the fucking head.
[28:10.86]Oh.
[28:11.00]Throw it!
[28:18.31]Look at Jaws in the top left.
[28:21.87]What?
[28:29.65]Fuck out of here jaws Please no more
[29:20.57]Don't fall, kid.
[29:28.45]There's only one guy saying no more?
[29:34.88]Alright, alright, alright, okay.
[29:37.08]Alright, that's fine.
[29:46.32]It's so dumb.
[29:48.14]It's so dumb.
[29:49.20]It's so dumb.
[30:12.21]Only one guy said, only one guy was saying no more.
[30:15.71]Wait, what?
[30:17.09]Only one guy was saying, only one guy was saying no more.
[30:23.13]You're going through too many layers of one guy.
[30:26.74]I can't, I can't follow you that well.
[30:39.91]There's only one spot?
[30:41.01]No, there's like four.
[30:54.83]Let's go!
[30:55.45]What's he doing?
[30:55.99]He's circling the boat.
[30:56.93]Let's go, man.
[31:09.49]Oh, oh, because he's, oh, yeah, okay.
[31:14.13]Yes, yes, I see what you're saying.
[31:18.60]Because there's only one green spot left on the boat.
[31:21.20]The game is so stupid that it has to be here.
[31:24.62]Get boxed, motherfucker.
[31:47.77]He just leaves.
[31:48.35]Yeah, you're done.
[31:48.79]Yeah, you're done.
[31:59.21]Got the stamp.
[32:01.56]Good job.
[32:07.66]Is that loud?
[32:10.02]Wait, that was... Oh my god, that is very loud.
[32:13.56]Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
[32:14.50]I didn't realize it was going to be that loud.
[32:18.04]I'm sorry.
[32:18.66]I'm actually very, very sorry about that.
[32:20.68]I did not know it was going to be that crunchy and that extreme.
[32:23.93]Sorry about that.
[32:24.71]I really am.
[32:27.43]I didn't mean to do that.
[32:30.31]My neck?
[32:38.08]Hold on, guys.
[32:38.58]This game's giving me a stiff neck.
[32:50.41]My hands are a little sore.
[32:55.33]That feels a little better.
[32:56.27]Okay.
[32:56.37]We had $50 come in.
[32:59.63]We had a 50, a 50, 50, 50, 50.
[33:05.61]5,000 bits from Goiki.
[33:08.71]Jersey, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[33:09.85]Thanks for the $50, Goiki.
[33:11.61]This game is fun in a stupid way, but it reminds me of the countless nightmares I've had about falling into the Jaws ride and it being a real shark.
[33:20.12]I remember, here's a quick story for you.
[33:22.42]I remember being really, really scared of the Jaws ride when I was like 10 or 11 years old or something like that when I went to Universal.
[33:29.14]And I hyped myself up so much, and I was so terrified of it, that when I actually got on the ride, I kind of closed my eyes for almost the entire duration of the ride, but I heard my brother laughing.
[33:42.53]and he thought it was really funny and I didn't understand why he was laughing so hard and he like kind of like open your eyes open your eyes and the job he does love you that don't know the jaws animatronic is so old it was so old and so shitty it was just like a sock puppet going like this and then it would turn and go like
[34:09.53]It was not scary at all.
[34:10.99]It was a- it was- the thing was on fucking springs at that.
[34:15.16]It was like the thing was built like in the fucking 70s.
[34:16.88]Didn't even look like a shark.
[34:22.14]And it's gone now.
[34:22.92]Yeah.
[34:24.66]Unfortunately.
[34:25.14]Do y'all remember that?
[34:26.52]Me and my brother just were laughing.
[34:27.72]We were like laughing and fucking high-fiving each other and shit.
[34:32.28]But I will tell you that the alien ride at Disney World, I did not fuck around on that one.
[34:37.38]There was a ride at Disney World, and I'm not sure if it's still there, it was at Epcot.
[34:39.98]It was something, it was like, um, Escape, Alien Escape, whatever it was called.
[34:44.38]This is back before they rebranded it.
[34:46.21]They made it a Men in Black ride.
[34:48.19]Before it was a Men in Black ride, it was just like an alien escapes from a fucking tube, the ride.
[34:54.63]And I remember doing this.
[34:56.15]So I heard how scary it was, there's an alien in the fucking tube and it breaks out, right?
[35:01.15]And the lights go dark, there's like scientists all screaming, like, he's out!
[35:04.91]He got outrun!
[35:05.67]They have these weird sensory things where it breathes on your neck and shit.
[35:09.10]I remember going like this, well, here's a strategy.
[35:10.76]If you're ever scared, and you don't want to fucking see anything that's going on in the ride, here's a strat.
[35:15.00]It's the pinky and the thumb.
[35:16.34]Pinky and the thumb.
[35:17.42]Pinky on the eyes, make sure your eyes are tight and closed, thumb in the ears.
[35:23.38]And you won't, there's no sensations.
[35:27.08]So, absolutely, I didn't hear, I didn't see anything.
[35:30.12]It's a foolproof tactic.
[35:32.04]Boom, boom.
[35:33.64]Like this.
[35:37.38]Because everyone goes, oh, no, no, no.
[35:39.74]Nope, you got the pinky and the thumb technique.
[35:42.78]And I did that the whole ride.
[35:43.64]And I didn't even see it.
[35:46.22]I got out of there.
[35:50.79]Professional coward.
[35:55.55]Professional coward.
[36:00.01]I was... I was like eight!
[36:04.42]You guys act like I was there like a couple months ago being like a scary alien!
[36:11.72]No!
[36:13.40]I was like eight or nine years old.
[36:14.94]I was like fucking 30!
[36:15.96]Although I probably still would use that technique, you know.
[36:18.97]Oh, this is the Wild West world.
[36:25.58]Why are you giving us tips?
[36:26.70]I'm telling you, in case there's any nine-year-olds that you know.
[36:32.50]You know, when I'm getting really into it, I go like this, I put my hand like this.
[36:35.75]Alright, let's play.
[36:36.39]If you have like a little brother, I don't know, like, I don't know.
[36:43.09]Can I skip this line?
[36:46.12]You can't get in here because there are too many people.
[36:53.40]How are you supposed to ride a ride?
[36:55.12]Do I have to buy?
[36:56.00]So you're telling me I have to buy.
[37:00.02]People should throw garbage in the garbage cans.
[37:03.16]It's pure common sense.
[37:04.82]There's a quiz.
[37:05.44]I don't even know what the quiz is.
[37:07.90]I have to go get a pass.
[37:13.00]Get another e-pass.
[37:18.14]Why would you gate this game behind fucking e-passes?
[37:21.78]I picked a trash...
[37:25.35]You have to deposit the trash into the trash receptacle.
[37:29.69]Oh, nice.
[37:32.81]Do you know where you're going next?
[37:34.38]No idea.
[37:38.08]So I'm going to go buy another... How many points do I have?
[37:41.16]So I'm going to go buy another E-Pass.
[37:42.94]And then we're going to go do the quiz.
[37:45.12]And then I'm never going to open this game ever again.
[37:55.10]Why is a kid picking up trash?
[37:59.24]You shouldn't be doing this.
[38:00.07]Oh, I got another stamp.
[38:02.15]Go on Jurassic Park.
[38:04.77]It's gonna be tough.
[38:05.77]Did you hear that?
[38:11.38]There's a big crunch up here.
[38:16.04]Jurassic Park is good.
[38:22.98]Jurassic Park.
[38:24.35]Omega Lull.
[38:26.99]Alright, do I really need a pass to do this?
[38:30.37]Why do I have to do... That's stupid.
[38:38.42]Can I just buy it from Woody Woodpecker?
[38:40.02]Do I have to actually go to the very beginning?
[38:41.54]I don't have to go to the very beginning of the entrance, do I?
[38:44.58]Oh, why?
[38:47.16]Why?
[38:49.26]You can't get in here because there are too many people.
[38:51.00]Okay, so I would like to purchase a pass from you.
[38:58.05]Just go in.
[38:58.57]Just fucking just go in.
[38:59.27]Just go in.
[38:59.69]I have to go all the way to the beginning of the entrance.
[39:04.90]This is so...
[39:20.85]Dermot, there are two hour waits in most theme parks.
[39:25.77]Not if you do the, um... The Easy Pass.
[39:30.84]Not if you do the Easy Pass.
[39:36.32]The E-Pass.
[39:38.26]Go get the Jurassic Park hat.
[39:39.72]No, I need a pass first.
[39:44.46]You missed bits, coward.
[39:47.51]I did, actually, right?
[39:48.53]That was from another fucking huge money drop.
[39:52.55]5,000 bits from YesIsOnline.
[39:56.96]Another 50 bucks.
[39:58.84]Thank you for your insane contribution.
[40:01.04]Remember, that was part of the Great Movie Ride.
[40:03.02]It was a compilation of movies with actors and animatronics.
[40:06.06]They tore it down.
[40:06.86]I pay in hand.
[40:12.64]Yeah, they did a lot of... They changed a lot of shit, didn't they?
[40:19.28]Didn't they replace it with like a Fast and the Furious ride or something?
[40:22.46]Where the hell am I going?
[40:29.40]Yeah, is it like a... You ride with the screen or something?
[40:33.80]Alright, this map is so bad.
[40:35.44]I can't even tell you where I am.
[40:37.12]I have to go this way.
[41:08.98]Why am I so far away?
[41:11.92]There's no entrance and no exit.
[41:16.61]No, I didn't get a cap.
[41:17.77]Get out of my way.
[41:21.54]Okay, we're almost done.
[41:22.56]Now I gotta go this way.
[41:28.22]I can't even go this way.
[41:30.14]Left?
[41:34.90]What the fuck?
[41:41.51]I have to go there.
[41:44.83]What is this Final Fantasy VII map?
[41:49.75]Yeah, it actually is.
[41:58.15]Dude, where the fuck?
[42:02.73]Jaws is over there, so I have to go back from Jaws, but isn't that what I'm doing?
[42:19.12]Go to animation or riot.
[42:20.80]I can't go anywhere.
[42:27.63]Okay, we're all the way out here.
[42:28.77]I need to go down that way.
[42:31.67]Back up and bang a left.
[42:38.15]This makes no fucking sense.
[42:40.80]This makes no sense.
[42:44.04]So I need to... I'm just going straight again.
[42:55.60]I saw, I just saw in the chat, the funniest thing I've seen all week.
[42:58.85]The funniest thing I've seen all week, absolutely, without a doubt, in like the last five plus fucking streams.
[43:05.77]The funniest thing I've seen all week.
