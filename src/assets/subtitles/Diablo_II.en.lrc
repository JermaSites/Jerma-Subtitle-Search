[00:01.20]Hello.
[00:02.90]Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[00:04.18]Hope you're having a good afternoon, everybody.
[00:08.64]I'm having a pretty good afternoon.
[00:12.02]Show yourself.
[00:12.78]Nah.
[00:16.36]Nah.
[00:21.69]He's early?
[00:23.27]Well, the schedule changed a little bit today.
[00:26.45]It's gonna be around like 4 or 5 p.m.
[00:29.03]Pacific.
[00:31.23]But, uh, change of plans, as you see.
[00:36.91]Apparently Joel is having PC problems.
[00:39.61]He got some new audio equipment that's, like, fucking up on him.
[00:43.19]So he's like, I'm just gonna troubleshoot it, and I'm like, go for it.
[00:48.27]Computers suck, how I understand.
[00:49.93]PC gaming?
[00:53.51]When you set up your setup... He hates OBS.
[00:58.75]Ha ha ha.
[01:02.81]What was he using before?
[01:05.07]XSplit or something?
[01:07.03]Here comes the substitute teacher voice.
[01:10.04]Good morning!
[01:10.80]Welcome class.
[01:12.26]I'm your substitute teacher.
[01:13.52]Today we're gonna learn how to do math problems.
[01:18.00]Okay?
[01:20.52]Thank you.
[01:22.75]Alright, so what we're gonna do instead is something I've wanted to do for a while.
[01:26.77]And it should be interesting.
[01:31.85]Interesting as in it could go very very very poorly very quickly or I'm gonna beat the whole damn game I'm gonna play Diablo II straight up vanilla Diablo II Hardcore and you guys decide every single thing you pick class you pick stat points and you pick the skill points and
[01:59.28]You're already dead.
[02:00.62]You are already dead.
[02:02.34]Yes Something like that.
[02:07.86]Oh That's a terrible idea I Actually was freaking out about this because I brought this up to be like a month or two ago and Somebody in the chat said dude, you're gonna die to corpse fire I'm like don't fucking say that
[02:26.55]Don't say that.
[02:28.33]Because I might.
[02:29.31]And it's... If you know, you know.
[02:33.86]When Corpse Fire dies, it's like eight minutes into the game.
[02:37.52]There is a chance that the computer will hang for three seconds.
[02:42.18]And he's going to explode and you'll die.
[02:44.76]It just... It happens.
[02:50.03]I have to be very careful.
[02:52.63]But I'm going to leave most decisions up to you.
[02:55.87]Now, you will not have the decision of choosing weapons and items.
[03:00.89]Because if you give me a complete and total dickhead build and make me use a club as a source verse or something, like, I mean, I'm going to pick the items.
[03:12.38]I'm not just going to be naked and shit.
[03:13.72]Like, that's not going to happen.
[03:18.04]But it should be fun.
[03:19.98]I also found out something interesting today that I didn't know because why would I know this?
[03:25.24]My Diablo II account is banned from Battle.net for some particular reason.
[03:32.59]I don't know why.
[03:33.61]I can't... I've apparently been shadow banned.
[03:39.75]I didn't do anything.
[03:47.64]I don't know when this happened.
[03:49.26]I haven't played Diablo II in at least a couple of years.
[03:55.76]But apparently I did something wrong.
[04:00.26]I'm not sure what it was.
[04:03.29]And here's the worst part about that.
[04:06.65]Diablo II is in a funny position right now on Battle.net where I can't buy another copy.
[04:15.99]I can't.
[04:17.41]To get a new CD key, I can't purchase another copy.
[04:25.30]Maybe it was a mod?
[04:26.28]I don't know.
[04:30.28]But I can buy a copy for a friend.
[04:33.78]So I'm going to have to eventually, if I want to play online, buy a copy for a friend, send it to their email, and then tell them to give me the CD key.
[04:52.45]Why would you buy again?
[04:54.89]Well, what am I supposed to do?
[04:56.25]Call Blizzard support?
[04:58.07]Hey, uh, I don't know what happened like four years ago.
[05:01.19]I have no idea, but I think I've been shadow banned on Diablo II.
[05:04.59]What are they gonna do?
[05:07.53]They don't give a shit about Diablo II anymore.
[05:18.24]You know, if...
[05:20.51]I would assume if they could just delete Diablo II off the store, they would.
[05:27.69]I'm not going to call Blizzard.
[05:32.99]But anyways, so I was under the assumption that I might be able to get a little help if I needed it.
[05:39.20]No, no, I have to do this alone.
[05:43.34]For the best, maybe.
[05:47.36]I was thinking maybe, oh fuck, this is gonna be impossible for me to do this alone.
[05:53.02]Hey, I know some of you guys have D2.
[05:54.93]Get on, like, just kill, kill Andario for me.
[05:58.23]Whatever, it's for the stream.
[06:00.73]I can't do that now.
[06:01.53]I have to do it all myself.
[06:06.16]Nope.
[06:06.28]Without further ado.
[06:09.01]We are gonna get started.
[06:11.47]Please do me a quick favor.
[06:14.05]I need to make sure that you guys can click on the screen.
[06:17.79]So... Uh-oh.
[06:23.79]Uh-oh.
[06:24.83]I just realized something very important.
[06:29.46]Okay, this is gonna be tricky.
[06:30.88]It's gonna take a little finagling.
[06:32.50]I just realized...
[06:34.93]that I can't can't alright how do you in windows 10 how do you pin a window to not be minimized anybody know is there like a shortcut because every time I click off the screen the window drops is there a way to just pin a window so it never uh never it gets minimized you have to do it in the task manager all I have is closed window oh that's complicated is it
[07:06.77]Make it windowed?
[07:07.57]It is windowed, but I have... It doesn't matter.
[07:12.21]Every time I minimize the window... Every time I minimize the window... No, no, no.
[07:18.16]Look, I'll just show you in real time.
[07:20.82]I'll just show you in real time.
[07:23.34]So, for instance, here.
[07:27.38]It's Diablo II, right?
[07:29.10]But, here's my cursor.
[07:30.68]If I click off the window at all... Bye-bye, here's my desktop.
[07:34.45]How do I do that?
[07:34.99]How do I keep that there?
[07:35.93]How do I keep it from doing that?
[07:37.17]How do I keep it there?
[07:38.91]Pretty sick background, I know.
[07:45.15]But to turn on click maps, I have to click out of the window.
[07:47.93]You know what I'm saying?
[07:49.35]There's got to be a way.
[07:51.95]What is this background?
[07:54.15]I don't know.
[07:54.53]Alright, we're not ready yet.
[07:58.42]Hold on.
[08:00.66]That's a boomer wallpaper?
[08:02.04]No, it's a default basic wallpaper.
[08:04.22]Sorry.
[08:04.68]Alright, where is it?
[08:06.44]I have to download a program?
[08:08.61]Do I have to download more programs for this?
[08:11.29]I think it'll be fine.
[08:12.03]I just have to, like, make the window maximize again when I turn on clickmaps.
[08:15.09]So anytime clickmaps turns on, just wait, like, five seconds before you click anything.
[08:20.99]I know that's asking a lot.
[08:27.04]It's an 800x600 boomer wallpaper.
[08:33.53]This isn't a joke background.
[08:34.87]Do you know how hard it is to find?
[08:36.83]I got three monitors.
[08:39.98]And it's kind of hard to find one that doesn't hurt my eyes.
[08:42.64]Because you get attacked from all angles.
[08:50.04]Just three.
[08:50.66]Just three monitors.
[08:52.05]Only three, Omega Lull.
[08:53.15]What do you mean only three?
[08:56.19]That's a ton.
[08:58.01]I'm under attack from my right screen.
[09:00.01]Because it's just there.
[09:02.69]What do I need?
[09:03.25]Who needs more than three monitors?
[09:04.62]What do you need it for?
[09:05.32]I'm not, like, watching TV on something.
[09:10.00]Maybe, I mean, that'd be kind of fun, actually.
[09:12.06]Alright, uh, we're gonna test to see if this works.
[09:15.26]Let me just see what happens.
[09:16.08]Here is Diablo II.
[09:17.00]Remember what happens if I die in Hardcore?
[09:18.98]I die.
[09:20.01]When you die, you die.
[09:20.87]When you die, you're dead.
[09:21.57]There it is.
[09:26.03]So, get the volume on.
[09:30.17]Okay.
[09:30.29]Okay.
[09:31.50]No, let me make sure the click maps works.
[09:34.06]Otherwise, that would be bad, wouldn't it?
[09:39.05]Yeah, you're going to get the mountains every time there's a decision that needs to be made.
[09:43.85]You're going to get these beautiful mountains.
[09:45.51]Alright, does click maps actually even work?
[09:49.42]It does.
[09:51.94]Well, this is just a test.
[09:58.98]Any people clicking?
[10:03.57]That's me on the right.
[10:04.59]Oh, look at that.
[10:06.46]It's pretty good, actually.
[10:09.10]You have scuffed maps.
[10:12.40]Well, the reason why I have scuffed maps is because it's actually easier for the bubbles to not run into each other.
[10:20.71]Alright, but this is not the choice.
[10:22.35]This is just us hanging out for a second.
[10:27.61]Click fire.
[10:28.27]I want you to be fire.
[10:29.25]Be fire.
[10:29.67]Be fire.
[10:32.01]just so you guys know, um, I really am actually looking to you to not ruin this whole thing.
[10:37.94]And I know you give, I'm giving this to thousands of people.
[10:42.62]So this is not, this is not at all.
[10:44.46]Take a look at those mountains for a second.
[10:48.01]Um,
[10:50.15]This is... And fine, if you want to have a 200 strength sorceress that has a melee for a move, I mean, I'll try to work with it, but just know, if I kill the last boss with this shitty character, I think I deserve something there.
[11:09.22]I think I deserve at least a little bit of credit.
[11:13.08]Don't do melee at shit.
[11:15.00]Well, alright, that's not up to me.
[11:17.78]Are you ready to pick the class?
[11:18.68]Here we go.
[11:19.22]Pick the class.
[11:20.92]I'll go over them, just in case people don't know.
[11:23.32]Diablo, it's been a while.
[11:24.71]Diablo II is an old fucking game.
[11:26.71]Amazon.
[11:28.01]Bows.
[11:29.17]Spears.
[11:30.11]Ranged, mostly.
[11:31.87]Javelins.
[11:33.25]Assassin.
[11:34.67]Traps.
[11:35.71]Bombs.
[11:37.04]Martial arts.
[11:38.42]Mostly melee, with a little bit of electricity involved.
[11:41.26]Necromancer.
[11:42.66]The meme character.
[11:44.32]Diablo II, if you don't know, has this thing where you can have, like, a hundred companions on the screen.
[11:49.66]This is the summoner.
[11:50.32]You can have, like, 85 fucking people running around with you.
[11:54.85]Okay.
[11:55.31]Cool.
[11:55.93]It kind of sucks, though.
[11:57.39]So, just to let you know.
[11:58.99]Barbarian melee.
[12:00.07]Very easy.
[12:02.19]Or you could put 20 points into potion find.
[12:05.67]And I'll be completely useless.
[12:07.09]That sounds fun.
[12:08.12]Melee.
[12:08.42]Paladin.
[12:09.68]Paladin.
[12:15.08]That's all you need to know.
[12:16.22]That's literally it.
[12:18.24]Sorceress.
[12:19.92]Magic.
[12:20.76]Casting.
[12:21.16]Spells.
[12:23.31]Fire.
[12:23.93]Lightning.
[12:24.41]Ice.
[12:25.49]And Druid.
[12:27.19]Summoning.
[12:27.79]A little bit of summoning.
[12:29.13]Also, shapeshifting.
[12:30.55]Bears.
[12:31.25]Turning into a wolf.
[12:34.41]You guys know?
[12:35.65]You guys get your ideas?
[12:37.68]This is it.
[12:39.54]Majority rules here.
[12:40.44]Whoever has the most percentage.
[12:42.58]And by the way, if you click on fire or exit, your vote is useless.
[12:47.38]We're not doing it again.
[12:49.80]Don't start yet.
[12:50.40]I'll tell you when.
[12:52.88]Look at those mountains.
[12:55.95]Those mountains are fucking beautiful.
[12:57.17]Here we go.
[13:08.06]I don't know, use window capture?
[13:09.22]That doesn't work.
[13:21.82]Okay.
[13:23.92]Well.
[13:32.27]Seems like a lot of people want to do necromancer.
[13:38.87]You're on an old version of Diablo.
[13:40.59]I'm on 1.14D and I have the glide wrapper installed.
[13:43.63]I shouldn't be doing this, but it is.
[13:44.95]And there's not much I can do about it at the moment.
[13:54.00]Alright, looks like we're doing Necromancer.
[13:57.30]Which... I'll work with it.
[14:01.38]Why do you guys want to do this?
[14:02.50]Do you really want to do this?
[14:09.35]This is going to be so... This is going to be the most boring playthrough ever.
[14:13.47]I'm not going to... Alright, this is also important.
[14:15.59]No, we're doing another vote.
[14:16.73]No, are we?
[14:18.11]Okay, listen, listen, listen.
[14:19.59]Important.
[14:22.85]I can't kill bosses.
[14:24.83]I know what you're going to do.
[14:26.39]I know what you guys are going to do.
[14:27.25]I can't kill bosses.
[14:29.71]Literally, this will be unbeatable.
[14:32.37]I'm going to have to hit the bosses with a wand or a stick like 600 or 700 times and run back into a portal.
[14:42.74]Alright, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[14:43.98]God damn it.
[14:45.86]Fine.
[14:46.26]Alright, let's go.
[14:49.28]Veto it.
[14:49.94]Veto it.
[14:50.66]I can't.
[14:53.15]Why did I say that in the beginning?
[14:55.35]By the way, this is the worst thing you could do.
[14:57.67]Actually, it's not.
[14:58.51]So, you just got baited.
[15:00.13]Congratulations, guys.
[15:04.42]Yep.
[15:05.08]Let's go.
[15:06.00]Check out those mountains for a sec.
[15:06.92]Okay.
[15:10.38]Okay.
[15:12.76]Barbarian actually would be the worst thing in the world if you did barbarian potion finding.
[15:16.36]I literally don't want to have moves.
[15:18.68]Or a melee sorceress with like 800 strength.
[15:21.67]Completely worthless.
[15:22.99]I can work with this.
[15:25.03]I need a name.
[15:33.55]Maybe I should pick the stats because otherwise this is gonna be fucking impossible.
[15:40.42]No, not sans.
[15:41.48]Of course somebody's gonna say sans.
[15:43.72]Unbelievable.
[15:44.62]I am actually fucking mad about that.
[15:46.88]I am actually upset about this.
[15:50.26]Tommy Pickles?
[15:51.02]How about, uh... Why Tommy Pickles?
[16:02.87]Makes no sense.
[16:07.03]Tommy Pickles does not make any sense.
[16:14.38]Chucky?
[16:21.86]Chucky the Necromancer?
[16:26.75]Okay, I like that.
[16:27.53]Here we go.
[16:29.71]Diablo II Hardcore as a Necromancer.
[16:32.47]Good luck.
[16:35.07]No.
[16:36.51]Too late.
[16:37.03]That's a bad name.
[16:37.74]It's too late.
[16:38.44]This guy's gonna last five minutes.
[16:46.08]It's a bad name.
[16:51.31]And, okay, Chucky's a bad name, but Sans is a good name.
[17:01.99]Tommy Lee Bones.
[17:06.78]Sans.
[17:12.62]Tommy Lee Bones?
[17:14.46]That's very elaborate.
[17:19.06]I like Tommy Lee Bones.
[17:23.81]And it fits.
[17:25.15]Tommy Lee Bones.
[17:28.41]Morning.
[17:28.73]Once a hardcore character dies, it cannot be played again.
[17:30.75]Are you sure you wish to make a hardcore character?
[17:32.31]Yes.
[17:32.49]Here we go.
[17:35.57]Can you guys hear it?
[17:37.27]I love this game.
[17:48.88]No doubt you've heard about the tragedy that befell the town of Tristram.
[17:52.72]Some say the Diablo walks the world again.
[17:57.15]I don't know if I believe that, but a dark wanderer did travel this route a few weeks ago.
[18:04.70]He was headed east to the mountain pass guarded by the rogue monastery.
[18:09.10]Maybe it's nothing, but evil seems to have trailed in his wake.
[18:12.92]I didn't skip anything.
[18:13.54]You see, shortly after the wanderer went through.
[18:15.48]Guys, everybody knows the fucking story.
[18:16.46]Do we really have to do this?
[18:17.04]The monastery's gates to the past were closed, and strange creatures began ravaging the countryside.
[18:22.70]Until it's safer outside the camp and the gates are reopened, I'll remain here with my caravan.
[18:27.98]I hope to leave for Lutgolane before the shadow that fell over Tristram consumes us all.
[18:33.66]If you're still alive, then I'll take you along.
[18:36.53]Mute the game audio.
[18:37.21]You should talk to a car, too.
[18:38.07]You've never played Diablo II, ever?
[18:39.53]She seems to be the leader of this camp.
[18:41.29]You're in for a treat.
[18:42.15]Maybe she can tell you more.
[18:46.59]Okay, so I'm a necromancer.
[18:51.44]We don't need the help on there.
[18:52.34]I already know how to play the game.
[18:54.16]Right now, as you can see, I've got my inventory.
[18:56.24]I've got a wand, which is plus one to raise skeletons, so I can have raised skeletons.
[19:03.36]None of this matters.
[19:03.94]I'm dead in fucking five minutes.
[19:05.02]I'm going to lose.
[19:07.22]Get rid of the wand.
[19:07.92]What do you mean get rid of the fucking wand?
[19:09.37]What are you talking about?
[19:13.19]Why would I get rid of the wand?
[19:16.45]See, this is why I'm so glad you have nothing to do with the items I can equip.
[19:20.19]Here's your stash.
[19:22.09]I can't wait.
[19:22.69]I love this game so much.
[19:25.05]Just like you played D3.
[19:26.97]Drop wand.
[19:28.09]No, I can't.
[19:30.22]I do have to do this, though.
[19:33.77]So, you, uh, reanimate a Skeletal Warrior from a target corpse.
[19:36.51]If something dies, you can bring it back to life as a skeleton.
[19:38.93]Right now, I have one total skeleton.
[19:40.47]It'll have 20 health.
[19:41.29]20, 20.
[19:42.00]1 to 2 damage.
[19:46.60]Drop the wand.
[19:48.20]Chat picks everything.
[19:50.94]To an extent, though.
[19:52.16]No, I'm not dropping the fucking wand.
[19:54.26]I'm not dropping the wand.
[19:56.20]I am Akara, High Priestess of the Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye.
[20:01.33]I can't summon a... I can't.
[20:02.87]What are you talking about?
[20:05.57]You can't punch things in the Necromancer in the level 1.
[20:07.85]You see...
[20:11.24]Our ancient sisterhood has fallen under a strange curse.
[20:15.90]The mighty citadel from which we have guarded the gates to the east for generations.
[20:22.78]I'm not dropping the wand.
[20:23.82]You're not going to convince me.
[20:25.84]This is hardcore, man.
[20:26.76]I don't want to die to corpse fire.
[20:27.98]If I die to corpse fire, then I'm not going to stream for a week.
[20:32.78]I'll just turn the stream off.
[20:33.52]I'll get out of here.
[20:34.38]No way.
[20:35.12]That's too embarrassing.
[20:35.90]Now the last defenders of the sisterhood are either dead...
[20:40.10]are scattered throughout the wilderness.
[20:43.03]I implore you, stranger, please help us.
[20:46.67]Find a way to lift this terrible curse.
[20:48.91]There's a terrible curse on this town.
[20:50.47]There is a place of great evil.
[20:53.23]There is a place of great evil in the wilderness.
[20:56.48]Kasha's rogue scouts have informed me that a cave nearby is filled with shadowy creatures and horrors from beyond the grave.
[21:05.10]You predicted it?
[21:05.66]Yeah.
[21:06.26]I've only done what you're seeing right now.
[21:08.04]Probably realistically 500 to 600 times.
[21:12.43]If you are sincere about helping us, find the Dark Labyrinth and destroy the foul beasts.
[21:20.34]May the Great Eye watch over you.
[21:21.94]Alright, so, Diablo II works like this.
[21:24.26]You get six quests in each zone.
[21:26.29]There are one, two, three, four, five zones.
[21:30.37]That's six.
[21:30.87]No, just five.
[21:32.27]Doesn't even know his own game.
[21:33.49]So the six quests in every zone.
[21:34.69]This is the first one.
[21:35.25]Look for the den in the wilderness outside the rogues camp.
[21:37.20]We're going to change a couple of things just to make sure.
[21:38.90]Because I don't like that.
[21:40.88]I don't like that at all.
[21:41.98]We're going to go into the options.
[21:43.00]We're going to go into the mini map controls.
[21:46.04]We're doing the small map.
[21:47.56]I'm going to fade everything.
[21:50.40]So then we just keep it on the screen there in the top left.
[21:52.68]Now we got a mini map.
[21:54.30]You click to move in this game, which is interesting.
[21:56.88]Click to move in this game.
[21:57.74]Alright, let's go.
[22:01.48]Let us pick the options.
[22:02.60]I'm not picking the fucking options.
[22:06.78]We gotta find the Den of Evil, guys.
[22:08.32]Are you ready?
[22:11.06]I'm so ready.
[22:15.60]This is a pre-recorded stream.
[22:16.82]That would be funny.
[22:18.10]Go get a Stone of Jordan.
[22:21.92]Just wait till you see the drops in this game.
[22:23.52]That's sick.
[22:25.14]I'm so nervous.
[22:25.78]I can't, like, walk around.
[22:26.84]So I got posters down here, obviously.
[22:28.28]You click on things to attack.
[22:31.43]Alright, we got one skeleton.
[22:32.97]His health is up there.
[22:33.71]Actually, I actually don't mind this.
[22:37.47]Hold Alt to see everything.
[22:39.91]Turn the game down?
[22:44.53]Is it allowed now?
[22:50.39]How's that?
[22:50.67]Better?
[22:50.85]Is that a little more bearable?
[22:57.21]Alright, looking for the Bloodmoor.
[22:59.47]No, we're in the Bloodmoor.
[23:07.94]Is your video buffered?
[23:09.04]What are you talking about?
[23:10.32]Buffered?
[23:13.95]It's Goldilocks.
[23:15.09]Too much!
[23:17.63]The game works just like... I don't... Why do I feel like I need to describe Diablo to you guys?
[23:22.36]It's... Every single human.
[23:25.72]Even people that don't play video games know this game.
[23:33.41]Every human.
[23:37.25]I literally don't.
[23:38.19]Do I need to explain Diablo II?
[23:39.78]Do I?
[23:40.18]Alright, here we go.
[23:41.52]You guys are gonna have some choices here.
[23:42.80]And you're gonna have to pick.
[23:45.90]That's the ultimate rumor.
[23:47.50]That's an air rumor.
[23:49.54]That's a fucking... That's flying, like, over the house.
[23:52.72]That's... Okay.
[23:56.15]We're good.
[23:57.93]The way that skills work in Diablo is every time you level up, you get a skill point.
[24:01.07]Each one of these can have up to 20 points each.
[24:04.89]Summoning spells, poison and bone, curses...
[24:08.54]As you can see, you have a lot of choices.
[24:11.32]Each one of these can hold 20 points.
[24:17.10]If I were you, if I was watching this stream right now, I would go open up a Diablo II skill calculator.
[24:26.80]Find out what you'd like to pick.
[24:30.20]If you guys choose nothing, if all of you guys click on the X, then I get to choose.
[24:40.28]Turn on 3D audio.
[24:47.45]That feature doesn't exist anymore.
[24:49.21]Alright, I need some items.
[24:59.48]We gotta find the little cave.
[25:00.56]We're looking for a little cave.
[25:01.60]It's a little... And by the way, I'm gonna level up soon.
[25:05.70]You guys will have an opportunity to fuck with me.
[25:07.26]It's alright.
[25:09.85]imagine min maxing every playthrough LOL yeah it's diablo man you gotta be careful he's listening to the he's listening to this in 2d
[25:29.75]I can't fucking believe this.
[25:30.81]This is not gonna work.
[25:31.47]You know how many times I've tried to do... Okay, you can only play as a summoning necromancer if you have like four friends to carry you.
[25:41.08]Oh, shit.
[25:42.34]Look at that.
[25:45.26]You wanna see?
[25:48.26]Show all items.
[25:49.14]Show all items.
[25:49.90]Alright, look.
[25:51.62]Low quality leather armor.
[25:52.78]That's a fucking PogChamp right there if I've ever seen one.
[25:56.34]Here's your belt.
[25:56.92]Your belt can only hold four potions at the moment.
[25:59.80]And these potions are not instant.
[26:02.76]You have to eventually end up spamming these.
[26:05.02]Here's the first thing.
[26:09.90]Alright, guys.
[26:11.82]Let me get to... Here's the thing.
[26:13.80]I can't just, like, stand still.
[26:15.70]Because this is hardcore.
[26:16.66]I'll die.
[26:17.24]Just wait a minute.
[26:19.43]We'll do this... Give me a sec.
[26:21.63]Alright.
[26:23.07]Is this safe?
[26:25.01]Is this safe?
[26:27.32]I think.
[26:27.62]Okay.
[26:29.64]We'll do the skill point first.
[26:32.97]So, the first thing you need to do... Is you have to pick a category.
[26:37.89]So it's gonna be category first.
[26:39.89]Okay?
[26:41.41]Once you pick that category, don't select anything.
[26:43.47]You're picking a category first.
[26:47.43]Is this a... Yeah, this is LOD.
[26:50.22]Don't touch anything.
[26:50.98]I'm gonna show you some mountains for a second.
[26:54.60]Okay, please choose a category.
[27:07.34]Right.
[27:10.94]I click this one.
[27:13.69]I choose Skeleton.
[27:15.05]I like Skeleton.
[27:16.25]He looks cool.
[27:21.21]Alright, point number one is going to go into summoning spells.
[27:23.70]It just is.
[27:25.00]It's too much.
[27:26.12]Alright.
[27:26.88]I'm going to show you a cool fucking mountain for a second.
[27:30.04]Okay.
[27:30.34]Where do you want me to put the point?
[27:39.38]There's only one place it can go.
[27:42.74]You can only put it.
[27:43.68]There's only one place it can go.
[27:46.34]I can't touch this yet.
[27:50.04]Gee, I fucking wonder where it's gonna go, guys.
[28:00.50]Well, okay.
[28:02.60]I wanted to raise Skeleton.
[28:08.50]now I got two pretty cool alright now we go dude I gotta figure out how to keep this thing from alright the stat points thing this is gonna be hard because this is so important like uh it's so important
[28:36.40]If there's somebody watching right now that's played this game, and I know this is probably up high in the categories on Twitch right now, you're about to see something that's gonna make you fucking just curl up into your chair, and I know, and I can't fix it, nothing I can do about it.
[28:50.27]Uh, by the way, this is for all five points.
[28:53.15]We're not gonna sit here and do each individual point.
[28:57.17]One at a time?
[28:58.07]This stream isn't gonna be all day.
[29:00.43]This stream is never gonna turn off.
[29:03.09]Every single point has to be voted on, but what about the mountains?
[29:10.69]Alright, this is for two at a time.
[29:12.52]Two at a time.
[29:17.78]Two points at a time.
[29:18.58]Where's it going?
[29:28.94]I'm not even sure it's far away enough.
[29:30.96]Make sure you're clicking on the right spot.
[29:32.44]Thank you.
[29:37.23]It might be too far away.
[29:38.31]I might have to decide these.
[29:41.64]I might have to decide these, these two.
[29:43.04]Wait, hold on.
[29:47.10]Mountain, waiting, zoom it in.
[29:48.99]I got, no, hold on.
[29:50.03]I gotta like... Zooming, it's gotta put those mountains.
[29:54.45]Hold on.
[29:55.25]I can't zoom in.
[29:56.21]I can't zoom in.
[29:58.13]I can't.
[30:00.91]All five.
[30:01.31]This is for all five points.
[30:02.49]I'm not doing, I'm not doing individual mountain voting.
[30:04.73]No.
[30:08.78]Okay, I'm going to take a screenshot and I'm going to zoom the fuck in.
[30:11.38]That's a good idea.
[30:11.92]Alright, screenshot.
[30:14.18]Print screen.
[30:18.89]Fucking didn't think this one.
[30:19.91]Alright, I got a print screen.
[30:25.01]Take a look at those mountains.
[30:29.55]Alright, hold on.
[30:30.03]Give me one second.
[30:30.97]Give me one second.
[30:31.57]This will be much easier.
[30:32.49]In fact...
[30:39.54]Yeah, this is going to be so much easier.
[30:40.76]Here comes the longest stream of 2020.
[30:43.70]Or the shortest one, I'm not sure yet.
[30:45.16]We'll find out eventually.
[30:52.31]Okay, hold on one sec.
[30:59.55]Okay, you guys will be able to see them both.
[31:02.07]That, okay.
[31:02.75]Okay.
[31:07.56]I just wish I could keep the window up.
[31:09.08]I don't know why it's doing that.
[31:10.14]I have it in windowed mode.
[31:14.14]I cannot play this game online.
[31:15.26]My account is banned.
[31:17.16]For no reason.
[31:20.00]I didn't fucking do anything.
[31:21.16]Alright, let's save this.
[31:31.82]Yep, yep, yep.
[31:32.67]Okay.
[31:36.01]Alright, here we go.
[31:38.31]So now I can just do this.
[31:39.67]This will be much easier.
[31:42.39]Should I do this for each individual skill tree too?
[31:44.51]So we can just go bang bang?
[31:46.37]I got a good idea.
[31:47.13]Hold on.
[31:47.49]Okay.
[31:48.23]I got a good idea.
[31:48.81]This is going to be a good idea.
[31:50.39]No, don't do that.
[31:52.23]No, that's a good idea.
[31:53.25]I mean, this is a fucking window shit.
[31:54.51]It's going to be all over the place.
[31:55.88]Alright.
[31:56.12]Just get, you know, here, like the stream hadn't even started yet.
[31:58.06]Just fucking hold on.
[31:58.96]I'm right back.
[33:47.25]Alright.
[33:48.87]I believe I'm ready to start doing this.
[33:54.64]Okay, for a second I just had a panic attack.
[33:58.98]Because I realized that this has been minimized the whole fucking time.
[34:03.96]And I could be dead right now.
[34:09.57]Okay, hold on.
[34:10.93]That just scared the shit out of me.
[34:13.01]Alright.
[34:14.01]Let me just get these loaded up.
[34:17.31]Alright, just hold on a second.
[34:18.41]The stream's starting in just a minute.
[34:19.75]Pick where you want five points to go.
[34:22.13]Go for it.
[34:22.53]Nice JPGE.
[34:31.51]Yeah, I know.
[34:32.27]I know.
[34:33.15]Trust me.
[34:45.09]Frank, okay.
[34:45.51]Of course.
[34:49.94]We did it!
[34:50.56]Hooray!
[34:53.02]Once we work the kinks out, this is going to be a lot of fun.
[34:56.06]Well, good for you guys, I guess, right?
[34:59.83]Okay.
[35:00.85]Five points in strength.
[35:09.21]Pay no attention to these.
[35:10.07]I'm just getting them ready.
[35:15.44]Don't click on any of these yet.
[35:22.42]Don't pay any attention to these.
[35:24.60]These are just putting my, getting my pages ready.
[35:33.89]Mountains?
[35:34.37]No.
[35:34.63]We're trying to minimize the amount of mountains we have to have.
[35:42.79]Okay, let's get that on there.
[35:44.11]And bone.
[35:48.15]Okay.
[35:49.55]Alright.
[35:57.81]I know it's going to be all stretched out, but it's going to be easier for you to click.
[36:01.19]Alright.
[36:26.78]Sounds good.
[36:29.35]Everything should be good to go, right?
[36:30.85]Now, very important.
[36:34.95]Turn that off.
[36:37.37]Sorry, guys.
[36:37.93]I didn't realize this was going to be as much of a pain in the ass as this actually is.
[36:44.94]All because I can't fucking get off my damn minimization.
[36:49.86]Don't get mad.
[36:50.56]I'm good.
[36:50.86]Okay, this is called... What is this called?
[36:57.69]This is poison and bone.
[37:02.88]Bone.
[37:05.34]Which one is this one?
[37:06.14]This is curses.
[37:14.07]Okay.
[37:14.69]What the fuck is this one?
[37:19.49]I promise we'll actually do something in a minute.
[37:26.43]Blame Blizzard for literally not giving a shit about the games they made 15 years ago.
[37:32.39]Unless they can resell them for $40.
[37:33.91]Oh, hey!
[37:38.05]We got some community subs.
[37:38.93]We had 20 community subs from ZapX.
[37:43.86]ZHapX.
[37:46.18]Wait, hold on.
[37:46.86]A bunch of money came in.
[37:48.66]Thanks for the 20 subs.
[37:49.46]Thanks for the $50.
[37:49.88]From AB Joe.
[37:56.77]Give me one moment.
[37:57.61]Well, I gotta get this stuff going.
[38:01.55]Kind of against the clock here trying to get this to work.
[38:04.19]Alright, now I just have to add it to the stream deck.
[38:10.07]Okay.
[38:14.18]We're just like, just look at the screen for a minute.
[38:19.38]Blizzard!
[38:20.78]Fuck your old games!
[38:21.68]Unless you can, 15 years later, sell them for $50.
[38:34.29]Alright, we're going to call this one phone right now.
[38:44.57]I wonder how many sad people buy, because they sell it on battle.net.
[38:50.17]They sell this shit on battle.net.
[38:53.43]I wonder how many disappointed people go to buy this and then go, wow, this is fucking like not even remotely close to being what it should be in 2020.
[38:59.28]Alright, hold on.
[39:03.08]Let me see if this works.
[39:05.59]Alright, there's the bone.
[39:08.39]This is all for a purpose.
[39:09.33]Trust me, I promise.
[39:14.60]There's a curse.
[39:19.16]Uh-huh.
[39:21.54]Last one, I promise.
[39:29.51]Summon.
[39:30.29]Here we go.
[39:32.24]Imagine there having to be third-party mods to have the game run in a fucking window correctly.
[39:38.99]Blizzard Entertainment.
[39:42.35]This ain't the same, is it?
[39:47.23]Alright, here we go.
[39:49.55]I'm ready.
[39:50.63]I'm ready.
[39:51.47]I'm actually ready to fucking do this.
[39:52.85]What the hell is this thing called?
[40:09.27]If I'm dead, I'm gonna fucking be so mad.
[40:12.47]Alright, we've finally crossed the threshold where I can do this.
[40:16.02]Sorry for the 500 people that left.
[40:18.46]Blame Blizzard.
[40:20.56]Always.
[40:20.95]Here we go.
[40:42.03]I'll be shocked if I get past fucking Act 1.
[40:44.07]I've probably not found the Den of Evil yet.
[41:01.53]I'm gonna blame the dumb idiot streamer.
[41:06.87]You could.
[41:07.37]You could, but don't.
[41:10.31]Holy shit, everyone came back.
[41:15.76]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[41:19.52]Hold on.
[41:20.64]Like, 700 people left and they all just came back instantly.
[41:23.29]Like, they all came back at the same time.
[41:30.47]They were all just like, alright, I'll come back in like 20 minutes, I'll get this shit figured out.
[41:38.61]Hey, what's going on guys?
[41:42.36]Not a big deal, don't worry, everything's good to go.
[41:44.54]Wait, I got two skeletons.
[41:46.30]I'm gonna have to use a sword.
[41:49.94]Where's the Den of Evil?
[41:51.04]It never takes me this long.
[41:52.18]I've played this game 2,000 times!
[41:55.02]Where's the Den of Evil?
[42:05.73]Do I have a stamina- I'm already- I already had a stamina.
[42:13.19]I didn't lose already.
[42:14.15]Your health has to go to zero to lose.
[42:15.53]Give me vitality next time, please guys, for the love of God.
[42:27.66]No, no, no.
[42:33.54]Use the bow.
[42:34.34]I don't have any arrows.
[42:40.18]This is the longest I think it's ever... This is the type of RNG you get where if I was speedrunning this game, I would just smash my fingers on the desk and then quit.
[42:53.45]What is it?
[42:53.77]A car door?
[42:55.97]Yeah, I smash my fingers at my car door on my desk.
[43:04.25]Ah, there it is.
[43:07.99]Help!
[43:10.11]Dammit.
[43:11.59]Why aren't you saying it?
[43:13.83]HELP!
[43:14.33]HELP ME!
[43:15.05]HELP ME!
[43:15.76]HELP!
[43:16.24]HELP!
[43:16.78]HELP ME!
[43:17.56]Got it.
[43:17.82]Alright, we have to kill every single monster instead of evil.
[43:22.16]Oh god, no, I died.
[43:23.38]Wait a second, let's do it.
[43:26.64]Good thing I got my two skeletons.
[43:29.61]Alright, I got a dagger.
[43:30.25]Shield.
[43:37.93]You're doing a pet build.
[43:40.43]No, pet build would be... I can't believe we're actually doing this.
[43:44.11]This is actually a dog shit.
[43:45.11]This is going to be so bad.
[43:46.54]Alright, hold on.
[43:49.96]What'd I get?
[43:52.46]Ooh, two sockets?
[43:55.16]Yeah, yeah.
[43:58.57]One to three.
[43:59.71]Go to four.
[44:00.21]No.
[44:02.51]You're a summoner in hardcore by myself.
[44:08.36]This early in the game, I mean, you get carried as a summoner to late game.
[44:13.30]I'm not going to be able to beat the first boss.
[44:16.14]I'm actually kind of glad you guys are doing the meme and putting points into strength, because I'm going to have to hit the fucking first boss with a wooden stick until the end.
[44:31.61]Alright, do I have any... I'm actually paranoid.
[44:37.02]This is so loud too.
[44:38.33]Why is this so loud?
[44:41.73]Blizzard, come on.
[44:46.11]Level up.
[44:46.97]Ooh!
[44:50.21]Amulet.
[44:51.77]Just to let you guys know, white is the lowest quality.
[44:56.66]Actually, grey could be, technically.
[44:58.32]It could be damaged.
[44:59.98]Blue is magic, just standard.
[45:01.73]Yellow is rare.
[45:03.07]And then gold is unique.
[45:06.69]Not legendary.
[45:07.29]You can call it legendary if you want.
[45:08.61]I know we leveled up.
[45:09.35]Just hold on.
[45:10.21]We know how Diablo works.
[45:12.01]Do you?
[45:12.57]I got like 10 people.
[45:13.83]There's like fucking 5,000 people here.
[45:16.82]Yeah, look it up.
[45:17.34]Just look up Diablo II rules.
[45:19.16]There's like a whole list.
[45:19.92]You can read them.
[45:25.06]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[45:27.06]There's a little mini boss in here.
[45:30.79]I gotta heal.
[45:31.61]Diablo II rules.
[45:33.07]It's great.
[45:34.73]Yeah.
[45:34.97]Alright, I gotta kill.
[45:37.60]Where's the shaman?
[45:49.21]Leather armor.
[45:49.69]And you have to identify shit in this game.
[45:51.19]Actually, let's identify this.
[45:52.97]Hey, +2 to strength.
[45:55.13]You guys are doing that already.
[45:56.13]Might as well just keep it going.
[46:02.67]Is there even any skills that the Necromancer has?
[46:11.55]Two to seven.
[46:12.55]I lose a skeleton, though.
[46:14.43]No, not worth it.
[46:15.98]I'm too scared to lose another skeleton.
[46:19.11]Alright, time to level up.
[46:21.63]So, here we go.
[46:26.67]Where are we going?
[46:29.75]Actually, I'm going to do it like this.
[46:39.99]So you guys never have to see the mountains again.
[46:45.78]I don't want you guys to have to see the mountains again.
[46:48.22]Alright, what are we doing?
[46:50.08]That's first.
[46:54.92]Oh, thank God.
[47:01.17]The mountains are the best bit of a stream.
[47:02.85]No, I don't... That's like jarring.
[47:05.47]Are we actually going to put points into vitality for the love of God?
[47:09.97]Thank you.
[47:10.99]Seriously, thank you.
[47:11.63]You're not going to regret this.
[47:17.73]Alright, thank you.
[47:21.68]No energy.
[47:22.46]Well, actually, that's not that important right now.
[47:27.60]Very cool.
[47:28.16]Thanks, guys.
[47:29.78]Back to it.
[47:30.16]Here we go.
[47:32.02]So.
[47:37.23]Yes.
[47:39.65]Good work.
[47:40.01]Alright, now for the skill.
[47:41.85]The skill point.
[47:43.79]First of all, you gotta pick a category.
[47:48.80]but uh wait why is this all up hold on a second it should be spread across the whole thing no what the block this in place for the love of god I don't want you to see the goddamn mountains I don't want you to see the mountains
[48:17.78]Okay.
[48:18.46]It doesn't matter.
[48:19.54]It doesn't matter.
[48:20.14]It doesn't matter.
[48:32.79]Alright.
[48:33.89]I know this is real ugly.
[48:41.28]Okay.
[48:42.10]You ready?

[49:11.85]Am I going crazy?
[49:14.72]Okay, am I going crazy?
[49:15.94]Why does this keep doing this?
[49:26.18]Okay.
[49:28.31]Fucking Blizzard Entertainment.
[49:31.37]Can you believe it?
[49:31.93]Where are we going?
[49:41.95]Why can I not see this?
[49:46.74]I didn't spend the point.
[49:49.28]Alright, we're going summoning.
[49:51.18]Good.
[49:52.24]Now where?
[49:56.09]Now what do you want me to do?
[49:57.43]It only took an hour.
[50:05.50]And then for me to say that I hate Blizzard for this to work.
[50:14.26]We can only go... Alright.
[50:15.40]We can't even go anywhere for this.
[50:21.01]I can show you what these things do.
[50:22.85]If you want.
[50:30.15]Alright.
[50:32.75]Three skeletons.
[50:33.41]Let's go.
[50:52.16]Dude, that's a 50% increase.
[50:54.82]Yeah, it is.
[51:09.43]Skeleton squad, moving on.
[51:10.59]How many more do we have?
[51:11.95]Money.
[51:19.57]Am I allowed to click on shrines?
[51:20.69]Yes, I am.
[51:21.47]Alright, group boost.
[51:24.21]Alright, so I had three points.
[51:29.45]He's still the same amount of health.
[51:30.71]Better attack and defense, though.
[51:31.63]That's good.
[51:43.60]I feel like we're gonna walk into a corpse fire here in a second.
[51:46.31]And I should hopefully get some good items.
[51:50.21]Players at 8.
[51:54.25]Players at 8?
[51:54.81]Did I do that?
[52:02.98]Players, how about players... No, that's... I'm gonna die.
[52:06.70]That's like the quickest way for me to get destroyed.
[52:12.09]four that's cheating that's reverse cheating that's seven times the difficulty you're gonna get more experience alright no no alright we'll do four players set to four that's more experience what if I die though alright I might I might revert this I'm kind of scared about this how many what if I how many okay it hurts
[52:44.04]It's power leveling.
[52:48.73]Yeah, it's simulating four people in the game.
[52:55.51]There he is!
[52:55.80]There he is!
[52:56.32]There he is!
[52:56.82]Alright, alright.
[52:57.26]No, no, no.
[52:57.64]Don't fuck this up.
[53:03.03]You guys get in there and that's corpse fire.
[53:04.57]He's fucking scary.
[53:07.25]He has electricity.
[53:08.07]He just fucking one-hit killed that guy.
[53:10.22]Come on.
[53:12.52]Hit the fucking thing.
[53:21.22]Oh no.
[53:23.90]He explodes when he dies and it's going to kill me.
[53:26.14]It's going to kill me.
[53:27.44]It's going to kill me.
[53:28.24]I'm already panicking for no reason.
[53:29.74]How much health does he have?
[53:31.34]alright get him get him
[53:44.57]You have the AFK build on.
[53:46.25]This is actually not that big of a deal.
[53:50.65]I'm good.
[53:52.15]He's going to watch this.
[53:52.83]Ready?
[53:53.03]Watch all three of these skeletons.
[53:54.25]Wait, does he not have that move?
[53:58.21]Oh, shit.
[53:58.67]He doesn't have that move in normal.
[54:00.21]Okay, well, we're fine.
[54:01.80]Level up again.
[54:05.76]There is one more monster left.
[54:07.20]What are you doing?
[54:09.62]Skeletons?
[54:10.14]You're going off on skeletons here.
[54:18.95]Where's this last one?
[54:27.48]We got a haha copypasta.
[54:29.94]Oh.
[54:31.96]Well... Cut it out!
[54:42.73]You're a monster.
[54:47.93]They're an underrated type of mon- I've never even seen this before.
[54:50.07]Alright, we got a bunch of dog shit we gotta throw away.
[54:54.34]Gonna kill one more monster, we're gonna- We're gonna get this down.
[54:58.40]So I can actually- Who the fuck is calling me?
[55:05.26]Alright, I swear to god.
[55:08.24]People only call my phone when the stream is turned off.
[55:13.46]Nobody fucking calls me at any second of the day unless I'm live.
[55:18.34]Alright, where's this last monster?
[55:30.07]They're trying to network with you.
[55:33.13]Why would you do... No, not when I'm working.
[55:40.07]You stream for eight hours, though.
[55:41.41]Yeah, but I start the stream around the same time.
[55:43.67]Like, between, you know, two in the afternoon, three in the afternoon, four in the afternoon, five in the afternoon.
[55:49.35]Sometimes one in the afternoon.
[55:50.23]You know, it's a big window.
[55:51.03]You're right.
[55:51.35]Alright, I gotta find this last monster.
[55:58.03]Where is it?
[55:59.63]Oh, wait.
[56:01.83]Alright, cool.
[56:03.61]Get all this gold.
[56:11.17]I'm not happy with Blizzard at the moment.
[56:14.85]I'm like actually annoyed by this I didn't do anything Greetings
[56:31.43]So, if we're doing the Den of Evil, we get a skill point.
[56:34.17]We're going to have two points to put in.
[56:41.19]Thank you.
[56:42.38]Alright, so, again, where would you guys like to go?
[56:49.04]It's so ugly, but it has to be like this.
[56:51.96]I refuse to show you the mountains.
[56:53.62]Where are we going?
[57:05.46]Okay, cool.
[57:08.64]Summoning, we got 2,000 clicks already.
[57:11.00]Show the available skill paths.
[57:14.02]Yeah, I'll do that too.
[57:16.04]I think I know where everyone wants to go.
[57:17.30]I want to go to summoning.
[57:20.23]Very cool.
[57:21.63]So from here, I wonder what you want to do.
[57:24.99]Yeah, so we're going to put it in.
[57:32.60]Skeleton build.
[57:33.36]Fucking dumbass boring chat.
[57:42.70]I didn't say that.
[57:44.18]Oh, yay, more skeletons.
[57:47.85]It's alright.
[57:48.39]It's okay.
[57:48.83]We're gonna be good.
[57:49.37]Alright, we're gonna put it into skeletons.
[57:53.95]Let's take a look at what these points actually do first.
[57:59.03]So, as you can see, here are the paths.
[58:04.37]oh you probably should have seen that first okay let's actually let's go over this first let's go over this first we've opened up some stuff alright so you right let's do we're gonna do it again ray skeleton skeleton mastery is what you can do as well because this path has gone over this way uh it's a passive
[58:29.87]Increases the life and damage of raised skeletons.
[58:32.77]So, you just make them better.
[58:34.99]More.
[58:36.05]Better.
[58:36.85]More.
[58:37.59]Better.
[58:38.57]At level 12, we can go down to Skeleton Mage.
[58:41.10]At level 6, we can do Clay Gaunt.
[58:44.04]More.
[58:44.58]Better.
[58:45.92]Poison and Bone.
[58:46.58]What is available is Bone Armor, which is just a shield of bone that absorbs and shit.
[58:51.38]It's pretty good.
[58:51.88]It absorbs 20 damage.
[58:53.08]As you see, I have 59 health.
[58:55.71]Which, that's pretty great, actually.
[58:57.15]Okay.
[58:58.96]Teeth, which I can explain as just it goes... That's seriously what it is?
[59:07.01]There's no other way for me to describe this.
[59:10.65]It's just a damaging spell.
[59:11.75]It shoots little goo balls out.
[59:17.01]Curses.
[59:17.88]Necromancer can cast curses on people that do various things.
[59:20.88]Like, for instance, amplify damage increases the physical damage that they take.
[59:25.76]They take 100% more damage from all physical attacks.
[59:30.14]Remember, 20 points can go into all of these.
[59:34.16]The reason why I'm doing this is because you see the screenshots we have.
[59:39.30]gonna have to remember uh we'll go over it before we do it obviously but for instance curses like that's what we have available but it's going to be grayed out but you see the path right alright so with that knowledge of knowing what we can do we'll do another we'll do one more here we go it's it's race it was race yellow okay that's okay now we have another there we have another point where's it going pick some pick a category
[60:18.09]You gotta pick a category for it.
[60:19.47]Alright.
[60:20.05]Okay, does it count if you pick the category and then you pick the skeletons?
[60:27.57]You're already just going to skeletons.
[60:37.73]It's already been decided.
[60:38.77]Like, I can't even... It's just going to skeletons.
[60:40.49]It's supposed to be category first and that's just not... Alright.
[60:47.04]Okay.
[60:52.53]We're making a huge -2 joke.
[61:01.63]Not me.
[61:04.74]By the way, we still only have three skeletons.
[61:12.26]Fixed stats.
[61:17.01]Five points.
[61:28.47]Why am I so boring?
[61:33.15]What?
[61:42.75]Whatever.
[61:43.43]Whatever you say.
[61:44.15]Alright, we're going with Vitality.
[61:50.76]Thanks for Vitality.
[61:51.50]Appreciate it.
[61:57.01]Thanks for the Vitella.
[62:03.67]Stupid chat.
[62:04.62]It's stupid.
[62:08.30]Go over what the stats do?
[62:09.32]I will.
[62:10.06]That's not a bad idea.
[62:14.16]Strength is just melee damage and able to wear heavy armor.
[62:19.57]Right?
[62:20.55]You can wear heavier shit.
[62:23.22]Dexterity is attack rating, which is how often you will hit something, and your defense rating.
[62:28.85]So, I mean, kind of useless for a Necromancer.
[62:32.35]Vitality is health and stamina.
[62:34.07]Stamina becomes absolutely useless.
[62:35.71]It doesn't matter anymore after, like, 50 points.
[62:38.63]And energy is mana.
[62:40.60]So this is health and mana.
[62:52.56]Kill NPCs.
[62:54.60]Stop going around, like, slashing.
[62:56.24]Alright, let's keep going.
[63:02.30]I need to do this.
[63:02.83]Let's sell some stuff.
[63:06.95]Kill NPCs.
[63:07.85]Alright, I gotta... Let's identify this ring.
[63:11.81]That's a pretty PogChamp right there.
[63:13.13]Pretty cool.
[63:14.63]I can't use this.
[63:15.33]This is sorceress only.
[63:16.50]I need to get a book, too.
[63:17.50]What do I have?
[63:19.12]90? 90?
[63:22.66]Oh, I'm not going to use a bow.
[63:26.06]I have to identify this shit.
[63:36.91]You can reset your skills once per difficulty, right?
[63:41.87]Is that correct?
[63:42.85]I don't have enough.
[63:44.21]Was it 360?
[63:45.19]What?
[63:47.93]There we go.
[63:49.35]What?
[63:56.31]350 or 360?
[63:57.22]360.
[63:57.30]I want to identify this because it'll be worth more.
[63:59.06]How the fuck do I not have 360?
[64:04.48]Alright, there we go.
[64:05.12]Now I can sell this for 840.
[64:06.16]You have to identify every single magic item.
[64:08.60]Now we got money.
[64:09.82]Town portal scrolls.
[64:11.23]This book allows you to travel back and forth from town.
[64:13.25]It's pretty useful.
[64:13.91]It's pretty good shit.
[64:15.97]Don't get the identified book.
[64:17.85]Cain does it for free.
[64:18.75]Well, I need it.
[64:20.67]Cain's not here yet.
[64:22.69]I'm doing this for the money.
[64:34.86]Alright, we're looking good.
[64:37.46]Continue.
[64:38.96]Let's do players... Players six.
[64:45.17]I'm going hard.
[64:45.65]Yeah, we don't have cane yet.
[64:49.51]We get cane later.
[64:55.64]Alright.
[64:57.10]So the next quest...
[64:59.41]After completing this, which it'll be completed, we have one here.
[65:01.78]Everybody skips this.
[65:03.50]Here we go.
[65:04.02]Okay.
[65:15.05]Remember you support Satan and worship him on stream.
[65:17.53]Why the fuck?
[65:17.87]Here comes 30 minute slow mode.
[65:19.21]Alright, we gotta go get Bloodraven.
[65:20.85]I'm not gonna put her on 30 minute slow mode.
[65:22.05]You want another reason for people to leave?
[65:23.60]Add a player when you add a skeleton.
[65:45.01]Alright, so we're gonna go out.
[65:50.61]How far, how close was the Den of Evil?
[65:51.97]I think it was pretty far away.
[65:54.00]30 minute bone mode.
[65:56.22]I can't have four skeletons.
[65:57.54]You guys need to read up on the lore.
[66:00.18]Look.
[66:02.36]I can't believe there's five points in Rey's skeleton right now.
[66:04.28]Okay, the next point in Rey's skeleton, we'll get a fourth skeleton.
[66:07.77]And they're just gonna die because they're weak and they're fucking worthless.
[66:25.99]He hates them.
[66:30.57]Geltons are cool.
[66:32.40]They can be pretty cool.
[66:35.24]Alright, so how far away were we?
[66:36.50]Let's get a good indicator.
[66:37.82]So we gotta go to the Cold Plains.
[66:40.18]Look for Bloodraven in the Burial Grounds next to the Cold Plains.
[66:42.86]In the world of Diablo II, every single thing is connected to itself.
[66:46.87]So, Bloodmoor is connected to the Cold Plains, which is connected to the Stony Field, which is connected to the passage to go to the Darkwood, which is connected to... Everything is in a row.
[66:55.39]And everything is sort of, kind of, sort of randomly generated.
[67:00.41]There's like seven different patterns.
[67:05.99]Alright.
[67:11.01]Got a waypoint.
[67:11.60]First waypoint of the game.
[67:12.52]I can't believe it's taking an hour to do this.
[67:14.78]Fuck.
[67:15.12]God damn it.
[67:16.48]Hey, stamina shrine.
[67:17.24]That means I can run forever.
[67:18.14]Alright, how many plays are it?
[67:19.80]Okay, be careful.
[67:20.98]I have it on hard mode.
[67:22.24]This might be too hard.
[67:27.48]Ooh, chipped emerald.
[67:30.87]Armor plus 3 to dexterity.
[67:33.81]Fuck it, let's go.
[67:43.51]Drop it.
[67:43.87]It's a bad item.
[67:46.11]I'm just going to use it.
[67:51.49]This is going to be bad.
[67:55.04]It's taking too long.
[67:55.82]I have to drop the difficulty.
[68:02.32]Name the skeletons.
[68:03.60]I can't.
[68:06.70]The gloves just go on automatically.
[68:12.39]They just get...
[68:14.48]Reanimated anyways.
[68:19.60]Power level.
[68:21.74]I mean, look at the EXP bar.
[68:25.85]Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[68:28.05]I gotta drop him.
[68:29.17]Four of us are whacking on the same guy and we can't do anything?
[68:37.07]I'll take it to players four.
[68:46.75]I can do one more skeleton.
[68:52.44]That's a skill shrine, by the way.
[68:56.88]Alright, moving to the burial ground.
[69:05.38]I have to be careful.
[69:06.34]I really do have to take this slow, because you can't just die in a second, but we're going to go find it.
[69:13.97]Alright, don't just run.
[69:14.81]Don't just fucking run.
[69:16.80]That's bad.
[69:18.82]That's unsafe.
[69:19.86]Why do you hate skeletons?
[69:22.86]There's one inside of you.
[69:28.71]That's actually scary.
[69:32.15]That's scary.
[69:40.37]Okay, I have five skeletons, guys.
[69:43.76]Don't I count?
[69:45.30]Technically.
[69:45.72]Aerial Grounds, what do you think?
[69:53.88]Induced and Legolas Pill.
[69:56.69]Why do you keep... Why do you guys keep showing that?
[70:09.99]Rejuve Potion is an instant heal.
[70:19.83]An instant mana heal.
[70:21.17]So that's good.
[70:22.27]It's very, very good.
[70:40.52]Burial grounds?
[70:41.90]Stonyfield!
[70:42.68]God damn it.
[70:43.32]No, that's wrong.
[70:44.43]We don't want to go this way yet.
[70:48.13]I'm sure he said worse.
[70:50.83]I don't... Have I said worse?
[70:53.05]I'm not even sure why that would be the worst thing I've ever said in my whole life.
[70:58.43]Okay, this is stupid.
[70:59.55]I'll just run up and... Alright, okay.
[71:01.29]This is bad.
[71:01.65]Very bad.
[71:01.99]Very bad.
[71:02.35]Very bad.
[71:02.65]I have no stamina.
[71:03.19]Do I have stamina potions?
[71:08.37]Okay, this is where it ends.
[71:10.53]Is there a champion in there?
[71:11.55]Oh, my skeleton!
[71:13.45]Okay, this is a battle.
[71:17.77]I have to be very careful.
[71:20.27]I'm gonna level up for this.
[71:21.57]Come on, level up.
[71:22.91]What do I have?
[71:23.65]Three?
[71:51.66]Is the red orb the health?
[71:53.78]Yes.
[71:54.00]Red orb is health and blue orb is mana.
[71:58.49]He's actually doing it.
[72:09.87]This is the slowest way to play this game.
[72:13.80]This is the absolute slug way to play Diablo II.
[72:23.21]Just stand around and hit each other in the face with rocks.
[72:26.83]It would be more... Alright, here we go.
[72:30.40]Necromancer gameplay.
[72:36.78]Here we go.
[72:37.16]You ready?
[72:39.70]Skill.
[72:40.60]Take a look at what we've got available.
[72:42.42]Summoning.
[72:43.14]Poison and bone.
[72:43.96]Remember, we've got like... And this shield.
[72:49.57]Curses.
[72:50.07]That's available up here.
[72:51.05]Amplify damage.
[72:53.09]Also, Rey's skeleton is available, and so is Skeleton Mastery.
[72:58.12]Please, if you could, pick a category.
[73:00.32]Pick a category now.
[73:02.32]Okay.
[73:22.63]This is gonna end real quick.
[73:25.73]Okay.
[73:27.61]Uh, we're already here, so what skill would you like?
[73:30.59]Remember, the one to the left is available.
[73:38.41]Oh, mastery is available.
[73:42.03]Holy shit, really?
[73:49.30]Okay.
[73:49.48]Okay.
[73:53.37]Okay.
[73:54.27]Gelt Mastery's really bad.
[73:56.19]I mean... Yeah.
[74:01.57]Well, no, I mean, it could be.
[74:04.68]Now we make the Bone Boys strong.
[74:09.36]Thank you for voting.
[74:11.96]We'll put that in Skeleton Mastery.
[74:15.00]Please choose where the five step.
[74:16.56]Fucking goddammit, I showed the goddamn fucking mountains.
[74:18.80]I'm actually pissed about that.
[74:19.89]Alright, where are we going?
[74:22.03]By the way, keep in mind, those are not what the points are right now.
[74:25.05]That's just because Blizzard Entertainment sucks, and I can't capture the window.
[74:28.77]You know what I mean?
[74:29.25]I've said that like three times now.
[74:30.33]Who cares?
[74:41.31]Vitality again.
[74:42.14]Hypers.
[74:48.56]We like mountains.
[74:50.36]We like mountains.
[74:51.22]Hype.
[74:55.43]So I can just click?
[74:56.43]Yeah, you become part of the vote.
[74:57.85]We're doing vitality.
[74:58.67]Thanks for voting for vitality.
[75:00.15]It's very useful.
[75:09.33]Alright.
[75:09.91]Vitality.
[75:10.63]Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[75:12.19]We now have 30 vitality.
[75:14.35]Which is... Okay.
[75:15.17]That's pretty good.
[75:15.61]We now have 81 health.
[75:16.87]Skeleton mastery.
[75:17.57]So our skeletons are going to have plus 8 life, plus 2 damage.
[75:21.23]Pretty good.
[75:22.23]Okay.
[75:22.93]Now they're just stronger.
[75:24.54]We still only have 3, though.
[75:25.96]Never mind.
[75:32.80]Actually, they are a lot stronger.
[75:34.28]Good decision.
[75:34.86]Nice job.
[75:44.94]I can't wait to do the equivalent for grinding for vials in Bloodborne.
[75:50.46]When everybody dies and there's like 30 people on the screen and I have to go grind for skeletons for fucking 15 minutes.
[75:56.04]That's going to be a lot of fun.
[75:59.37]Oh, alright.
[76:07.91]Wait, there's a champion.
[76:09.01]Champion.
[76:14.20]Of course they're king.
[76:14.88]They're doing much better.
[76:16.78]Yeah.
[76:16.96]They're doing alright.
[76:19.62]Alright, come over here.
[76:22.70]Fight this thing.
[76:23.94]Does he have, like, electricity?
[76:25.38]Okay, he's immune to fire.
[76:28.28]Alright, just gang up on him.
[76:30.30]Does he explode?
[76:34.99]Does this guy explode?
[76:36.05]I don't know.
[76:38.13]He might.
[76:40.75]Okay, he does.
[76:41.33]Thank god I moved away.
[76:49.35]I'm gonna die from that guaranteed.
[76:51.19]I guarantee it Skeletons don't suck I do Fresh skeleton
[77:06.37]Oh yeah, we had big money come in too, like a few times.
[77:10.01]We had 10 communities up from SuperBruce right now.
[77:11.85]Thank you, Bruce.
[77:14.35]And we also had enough- 5,000 bits from Phylactery and A.B.
[77:19.30]Joe.
[77:19.72]Thank you, both of you.
[77:20.48]Jesus.
[77:21.56]I fucking love skeletons.
[77:25.94]Make sure we go over in detail those at the end of the stream.
[77:33.58]Thank you guys, seriously.
[77:35.14]I probably missed more, too.
[77:36.06]I was too busy yelling at the ceiling.
[77:39.18]Alright, we need to find the barrel.
[77:44.03]We're going for a boss.
[77:46.83]Still on single-digit skeletons.
[77:50.47]What a rookie.
[77:53.97]How is that a rookie?
[77:58.73]It's not even possible to do what you're describing.
[78:04.77]Alright, is this better?
[78:05.35]I lose a point in skeleton, but I'll be able to kill things.
[78:10.75]Two to four.
[78:12.14]Three to six.
[78:13.12]I'm going to lose... Alright, I lose a point in skeleton.
[78:15.38]No.
[78:15.76]Okay, fine.
[78:19.44]Poor health.
[78:21.00]This thing's broken.
[78:21.76]Fuck it.
[78:23.70]Let's put this... Let's take that.
[78:26.83]I'm running out of room here.
[78:27.65]Four to nine throw damage.
[78:33.11]Would I have her head on three?
[78:34.66]Same thing.
[78:35.30]Alright, let's go.
[78:42.52]Is this guy streaming Diablo?
[78:44.08]Is this guy watching skeletons play Diablo II while he streams Diablo II?
[78:50.44]Alright.
[78:51.06]Careful.
[78:51.70]He's a champion.
[78:53.81]They're harder.
[78:54.93]Uh, yes.
[78:58.35]That is kind of what's happening.
[79:09.28]No, I can't.
[79:20.59]I can't do well.
[79:22.21]Alright, we gotta level up.
[79:23.09]We're not gonna use it yet.
[79:29.19]Alright, we came from... It's flabby over here.
[79:31.55]We came from this way, right?
[79:33.99]So...
[79:35.80]Yeah.
[79:36.54]Look for the burial grounds.
[79:37.58]Every single... They're all in the edges.
[79:41.12]Essentially, if you follow the road on here, you see, you'll eventually find something.
[79:46.49]Put a face cam on a skeleton.
[79:54.07]This is a random dungeon.
[79:55.01]I don't want to go in there.
[79:58.36]In fact, let's find this shit while I have the stamina potion.
[80:00.78]I can run forever as long as I... No, it's not over there.
[80:06.29]I wanna get swarmed by a bunch of fucking people.
[80:08.22]Dying here is bad.
[80:09.72]If I don't make it through Act 1, then... I gotta think of some kind of punishment, because that... Come on.
[80:16.48]I have to do Act 1.
[80:17.28]Aerial Grounds?
[80:21.74]Got it.
[80:22.08]Okay.
[80:24.31]Alright, if I do not... If I die before Act 1 is over, I will do a... I will do a Mountain Scream.
[80:34.46]Or, like, at least five minutes with, like, calm music in the background.
[80:37.26]Who cares?
[80:37.66]What's that punishment?
[80:40.96]Alright, hold on.
[80:43.69]Let me go back.
[80:45.39]Town portals work the same way they do in the other Diablo games.
[80:51.37]Gotta kill Bloodraven.
[80:53.97]Greetings.
[80:55.73]Alright, let's sell all this shit.
[80:57.77]One.
[80:58.75]Sell.
[80:59.77]Sell.
[81:00.53]Sell.
[81:04.87]This is a... I need a belt.
[81:07.23]I can only hold four potions at a time.
[81:08.71]Do you have a belt?
[81:10.91]Who has a belt I can buy?
[81:16.19]Why did I just fucking identify that?
[81:17.47]Alright, give me a couple of these.
[81:22.07]Alright, no, no, no, no, no.
[81:22.79]I need a belt.
[81:23.87]Otherwise, I'm just going to hold on to these potions in my inventory.
[81:26.53]Belt.
[81:30.57]Force, strength, mountain, stream, promise.
[81:33.59]Will I have to beat Act 1?
[81:34.31]I sold the last one?
[81:37.63]What am I, stupid?
[81:40.69]$1,000.
[81:40.79]Alright, this is $200.
[81:41.45]See, now I get another slot here.
[81:52.13]Alright, not bad.
[81:53.99]Still have town portals up here.
[81:56.29]Alright, I'm ready.
[81:59.31]Alright, let's take a look at what we have available.
[82:00.63]I'm level... Alright, so I just... I'm level 6.
[82:04.01]We have Unlocked.
[82:05.97]And we have, obviously, Ray Skeleton.
[82:07.60]Skeleton Mastery.
[82:08.96]We also now have Clay Golem.
[82:10.68]Rates a golem from the Earth to fight at your side.
[82:12.74]It's just a little buddy.
[82:19.18]60 attack, 100 defense with 100 life.
[82:23.88]2 to 5 damage, and a 20% attack bonus.
[82:27.04]And it slows enemies.
[82:28.24]Just to give you an indicator of what that means.
[82:30.94]So, attack 95 and 95, and 50 health.
[82:35.36]And they do 3 to 4 damage.
[82:38.44]There's the difference.
[82:40.84]We've also unlocked Poison Dagger.
[82:42.96]That's poison to your dagger attacks.
[82:44.82]I don't have a dagger, but it will make me do a lot more damage if need be.
[82:48.84]We have unlocked that.
[82:49.57]We still have Teeth.
[82:53.25]We've also unlocked another curse.
[82:55.02]Dim Vision.
[82:56.48]The curse is a group of monsters reducing their vision radius.
[83:01.46]I have no comment on that because that's... I am not going to give you a comment because I don't want to influence anybody's opinion.
[83:11.80]So, what category would you guys like to go to?
[83:27.27]Sure.
[83:30.61]Okay.
[83:33.41]Now, in this category, remember you have the top three are available.
[83:36.45]Clay Golem, Skeleton Mastery, and Skeletons.
[83:41.79]We're going back to summoning.
[83:43.17]Where here would you like to go?
[83:45.83]He's an Influencer.
[83:48.07]Okay.
[83:48.79]Alright.
[83:49.15]We've got it.
[83:49.57]Now we've got it.
[83:50.72]Now we've got it.
[83:56.55]Now we've got some actual... You know, people actually have to think about this shit now.
[84:07.20]They're assembling the squad.
[84:11.96]More skeletons.
[84:12.86]Fuck goblins.
[84:13.62]Well, it's a golem, not a goblin.
[84:18.17]Golem.
[84:18.81]Not golem.
[84:19.53]What did I... I'm stupid.
[84:20.51]Alright, what... Whoa!
[84:24.27]What just happened?
[84:26.00]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[84:29.79]What is going on?
[84:35.15]Okay.
[84:36.19]Alright.
[84:36.55]Something... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[84:39.43]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[84:41.43]Do it again.
[84:42.91]Something fucked up just happened there.
[84:44.17]Do it again.
[84:56.22]Something's fishy there.
[85:07.55]What is happening?
[85:11.29]What are you?
[85:11.89]Wait, why?
[85:12.53]Why is this possible right now?
[85:14.09]There's no 10,000 people didn't click.
[85:18.79]One vote per viewer.
[85:22.43]Start click map.
[85:28.94]Alright, now we got it.
[85:40.13]Now it's actually working.
[85:42.63]Somebody was cheating.
[85:44.91]Yeah, there was some... This is... Ugh.
[85:56.53]Do it in mastery.
[85:59.15]We'll do it... I don't know.
[86:03.43]Why would you clickbot a Diablo II stream?
[86:05.51]Because you really want four skeletons on the screen.
[86:13.62]I don't know what the fuck to do here.
[86:14.68]Because this is... I mean, technically... Technically, there's a winner.
[86:19.70]Okay.
[86:20.36]Three.
[86:22.18]Two.
[86:22.42]One.
[86:26.86]Done.

[86:32.60]Thank you for voting.
[86:34.86]Please choose the stat points.
[86:36.85]Five are going in.
[86:47.85]Now all of a sudden everybody wants strength, huh?
[86:50.66]Now magically, randomly, people decide that that's what they want.
[86:58.93]You did vitality twice.
[87:00.23]That's good.
[87:01.27]Okay.
[87:05.02]Attack raises skeletons.
[87:06.70]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[87:08.30]Let's go.

[87:10.54]Easy on those mountains for a second.
[87:17.58]Call them.
[87:19.90]And then...
[87:26.23]Worst possible thing you could possibly do.
[87:27.67]Would you like to see our new friend?
[87:35.41]He's perfect!
[87:41.88]Okay, keep going.
[87:42.62]Now we have to fight the boss.
[87:49.50]Everything looks good.
[87:50.20]Everything looks good.
[87:52.84]It's not a skeleton.
[87:54.92]No, it's not.
[87:56.26]But I have town portals, right?
[87:57.94]Alright, it's time to get blood-braiding.
[87:59.68]Everybody good?
[88:04.50]Let's go.
[88:07.01]You made it.
[88:08.95]This is a poop monster.
[88:10.19]No, it's a clay monster.
[88:12.33]It says it in the title of the guy's stream.
[88:17.21]Here we go.
[88:17.99]Go!
[88:21.44]There she is.
[88:21.88]Alright.
[88:22.32]I can actually die from this.
[88:23.18]Like, very, very, very easily.
[88:25.35]Is there anyone?
[88:25.91]We got three and... Get in there.
[88:40.51]look at he's absorbing he's absorbing so much damage he's just a skeleton with extra steps he's a chat
[89:04.51]I'm doing just fine.
[89:08.93]This is fine.
[89:11.75]I'm not in any danger at all.
[89:15.06]I love it on my friends.
[89:16.10]I'll say that now.
[89:18.82]Nobody even died.
[89:21.80]Alright, warm up.
[89:26.57]Get in there.
[89:27.99]Let's go.
[89:32.93]Surround!

[89:39.46]Don't let her get away!
[89:44.50]Somebody said, get the dagger, please!
[89:48.24]I'm gonna be here for a while.
[90:12.02]Three, two, one.
[90:20.70]I can't use this, but it's pretty cool.
[90:22.38]Oh, there's a dagger.
[90:22.99]Nice job, guys.
[90:24.49]You did a good job.
[90:25.15]Yeah, first barrier of the game.
[90:30.61]Uh, 40 strength required.
[90:32.01]Don't take that as an opportunity.
[90:32.97]Don't take that as an opportunity.
[90:34.97]Um...
[90:43.82]Charms just have to be in your inventory.
[90:45.54]And they get whatever is the bonus that's on it.
[90:47.68]So I plus the root of strength as long as it's in my inventory, I get it.
[90:54.24]5% chance to cast level 1 amplified damage on striking.
[90:57.44]More damage to demons.
[90:59.29]More attack rating, which means you hit more often against demons.
[91:03.53]Fire damage and 4% life stolen per hit.
[91:05.71]Cool.
[91:09.23]Oh, we also get a... We're doing the Bloodraven quest.
[91:12.65]We get a companion.
[91:14.23]Kyle.
[91:14.83]Not Kyle.
[91:15.18]Kyle's back.
[91:15.44]Mod her.
[91:40.11]Uh, she needs a bow.
[91:43.95]Alright, now it's time to go get Cain.
[91:49.41]I'm gonna go get Deckard.
[91:52.56]You must go through Tristram and find him.
[91:59.38]We know.
[91:59.66]Alright, we gotta go through the Darkwood.
[92:02.96]There's a tree.
[92:05.54]This is where it gets a little... This is where the game actually gets a little bit more difficult.
[92:08.63]Especially when we go to Tristram.
[92:11.79]Uh, this is her inventory.
[92:13.59]Need to give her something.
[92:17.89]Let's go get a bow.
[92:22.35]Even if it sucks, doesn't matter, as long as you just have one.
[92:25.61]Uh, $177?
[92:25.69]Take it.
[92:26.15]Uh, what is... 10 mana.
[92:33.36]Do I have anything that has a socket in it?
[92:35.68]No.
[92:37.04]Let's just stash it for now.
[92:42.90]I'm not going to sell this.
[92:44.16]Maybe I just should sell it.
[92:46.40]This is just giving you guys incentive to fucking make me have 40 strength.
[92:49.10]Control click on an item?
[92:56.31]What are you talking about?
[92:58.75]I can't use that.
[93:00.13]You can't use that.
[93:01.97]You need to be level 5 to use this piece of shit?
[93:03.91]What?
[93:08.74]Oh, come on.
[93:14.49]Alright, let's go get Deckard Cain.
[93:17.93]The level 2 companion.
[93:19.41]Oh, that's the problem.
[93:20.41]That's a huge problem.
[93:22.65]Okay.
[93:28.10]I have three portals.
[93:29.24]That should be enough.
[93:31.32]Everyone's good to go?
[93:31.91]Let's move.
[93:38.02]So we need to go through... Alright, memory serves me correctly here.
[93:42.90]We gotta go to Stony Field, and then through the Underground Passage, right?
[93:48.91]Go to the Underground Passage through the Darkwood.
[93:50.57]Okay.
[93:56.11]Turn your facecam off and play ads.
[93:57.47]I don't think I'm gonna do that.
[94:01.74]That doesn't sound like something that I would want to do.
[94:04.52]Ah!
[94:08.99]Alright, going good so far.
[94:09.91]Let's move.
[94:12.73]Can we use this?
[94:15.71]What level do you like to be for this?
[94:17.81]Alright, you can use this.
[94:19.61]I'll put that to good use.
[94:21.15]Every act has a different companion, by the way.
[94:24.57]And we're not even going to care.
[94:28.90]We're going to have 50 companions anyways.
[94:31.66]Or maybe not.
[94:33.80]What's this Jermacraft?
[94:34.68]What are you doing?
[94:36.96]Wait, wait, wait.
[94:43.13]Why did I need to see this?
[94:48.13]What's the point of me seeing this?
[94:58.30]Is me holding a diamond pickaxe?
[95:16.81]Alright, follow me.
[95:25.36]The real test is if I can kill Andariel coming up here in a little bit.
[95:39.13]I got excited for the club because I just kept seeing me using it.
[95:48.87]Was this an armor?
[95:49.66]10 mana?
[95:50.20]Yeah.
[95:50.92]Give me this shit.
[95:53.14]Look at that.
[95:54.00]Just go up by 10.
[95:55.02]Fucking sick.
[95:56.02]Wait!
[95:56.38]You can wear this, can't you?
[95:58.82]Yes, you can.
[96:02.33]That one's even dying.
[96:03.05]This is actually going pretty well.
[96:05.69]Andario Poison is going to one-shot your minions.
[96:07.65]Yes, that's true.
[96:09.25]It's actually going to be probably a fucking nightmare.
[96:10.96]It's going to be an absolute nightmare.
[96:17.88]We shall see how this goes at home.
[96:39.57]Everyone good?
[96:40.69]Three skeletons, golem, yep.
[96:44.54]Do not die to Rakanissu.
[96:51.74]Imagine if I killed fucking Diablo with this shit.
[97:11.26]Alright, we need to go down and then up.
[97:13.14]Ooh, that's what I wanted.
[97:17.88]Now I'm gonna get past the burial.
[97:20.54]Oh, sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-
[97:56.94]Is skeletons OP like in Path of Exile?
[97:59.14]It depends on what you mean by that.
[98:01.40]Because the answer is no.
[98:03.22]But it could be yes.
[98:05.88]It's possible.
[98:13.98]A loud game.
[98:14.76]Yeah, why is it doing this?
[98:23.27]Grunts are so loud.
[98:24.41]I'm crying.
[98:24.99]I don't know why it's doing that.
[98:37.94]Yeah, music's fucking awesome in this game.
[98:39.42]Alright, let's go.
[98:43.02]Oh, I'm gonna make my run for it here.
[98:45.16]This is a little ballsy, but, you know.
[98:49.99]Okay.
[98:51.55]That's a little too ballsy, potentially.
[99:01.23]Where's that at?
[99:02.40]Level 2?
[99:04.10]I don't want level 2, though.
[99:06.69]I want the Darkwood.
[99:09.13]Oh, f***.
[99:09.61]Don't go that way.
[99:12.15]Don't be a fool.
[99:12.95]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[99:13.83]But if I have the Stamina Potion, though.
[99:16.60]If I have the Stamina Shrine, then just go for it.
[99:20.10]You know, you can run faster than everybody else.
[99:24.52]Oh, his CD key is banned.
[99:25.98]Yeah, I know.
[99:26.96]That's what I'm saying.
[99:27.79]Why?
[99:28.19]I didn't do anything.
[99:32.43]That could have been real bad.
[99:43.06]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[99:47.28]Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.
[99:56.62]Holy shit.
[99:57.84]Okay.
[99:58.44]This is bad.
[99:58.90]This is very fucking bad.
[100:00.36]I, I, this is a... Why did I do this?
[100:03.10]Oh, right, no, I'm good.
[100:04.98]Holy shit.
[100:07.04]Help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help.
[100:08.88]I can't die right now.
[100:09.60]I don't want to do a mountain stream for ten minutes.
[100:14.32]Where's everybody?
[100:23.17]Oh shit, that's it.
[100:23.87]Okay, alright, alright.
[100:24.75]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[100:25.82]Oh my god, people are dying.
[100:42.62]We're good, we're okay, we're okay.
[100:44.16]Quick, use homeward bone.
[100:46.18]Nah, we're fine, we're fine.
[100:47.58]Everything's gonna be just fine.
[100:51.67]Where's my- where are my skeletons?
[100:59.23]Alright, just stay over there for a second.
[101:01.53]How am I already full?
[101:15.20]Alright, I gotta get out of this.
[101:18.76]It's probably right up here.
[101:20.54]My boots are broken?
[101:25.47]That's too ballsy.
[101:35.31]Stop.
[101:35.59]No!
[101:46.40]Part of me is actually kind of glad this is happening like this, because otherwise this would be... I'd be all alone in here.
[101:53.46]I don't want that.
[102:02.31]Good, good, good, good, good.
[102:03.99]Good work.
[102:24.93]I almost had a stamina.
[102:27.15]Oh, this is a bad idea.
[102:28.41]Oh, this is a bad idea.
[102:30.19]What am I doing?
[102:30.79]What do I do?
[102:31.13]I gotta slow down, slow down, slow down.
[102:32.41]Town portal.
[102:33.99]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out of the game.
[102:40.42]Get out, get out.
[102:41.62]I need health, health, health, health right now, now, now, now, now, now, now.
[102:43.48]Okay, I almost just died.
[102:52.81]That was actually... Yeah, because if I... That's it.
[102:54.79]If I'm dead, I can't really seriously have to be careful.
[103:00.94]No, leave.
[103:01.76]Like, actually, leave over here.
[103:03.06]Okay.
[103:12.42]What is it on?
[103:12.92]Player count?
[103:13.44]Like, six?
[103:18.38]I should probably turn that off.
[103:20.96]Ten health.
[103:24.24]Is that on four?
[103:25.08]Alright, I'm going to set it to three.
[103:39.05]I got body blocked by everybody standing around.
[103:41.57]I got body blocked by my own friends.
[103:47.38]Alright.
[103:48.74]Let's pick something.
[103:53.48]2,000 playthroughs and he has to play on three?
[103:55.37]I didn't make any of these decisions.
[103:57.97]There's 30 points in strength right now as a necro.
[104:01.61]Do you understand?
[104:02.81]What do you want me to do about that?
[104:09.65]That's what I'm saying.
[104:10.15]When people come to this stream and they see like, oh, Diablo II.
[104:13.18]Sick.
[104:14.76]Wow, there's people watching this.
[104:16.68]I love Diablo II.
[104:17.64]What's this fucking idiot doing?
[104:19.64]Somebody help him.
[104:20.84]Please help him.
[104:23.81]Alright, what are we doing for, uh, you know what to do.
[104:26.02]Well, actually, take a look.
[104:29.14]Remember, here's what we have.
[104:30.98]Gray Skeleton.
[104:33.37]Clay Golem.
[104:35.13]You know the point of Clay Golem.
[104:36.19]It'll increase the health and everything, make him better.
[104:38.39]Poison and Bone.
[104:39.37]Same ones are available.
[104:40.38]Poison, Dagger, Teeth, and Bone Armor.
[104:44.98]This is survivability.
[104:46.08]This is me actually being able to do anything else besides stand around and hit with a stick.
[104:51.70]And we also have dim vision and amplify damage.
[104:55.63]Seeing what they do.
[104:56.71]Okay, here we go.
[104:59.07]Where are we going?
[105:10.14]Hmm.
[105:15.54]I'm gonna keep quiet.
[105:17.28]I don't want to influence anything.
[105:27.01]Alright, why does this keep happening?
[105:40.03]Again, alright, I have the checkbox set for only allow one click per user.
[105:45.81]But if I reset the poll, I have to do that.
[105:47.95]Okay, here we go.
[105:48.65]Here it is again.
[105:57.76]You need an updated screenshot.
[106:02.04]I might as well just open up like a web page and just show it on there.
[106:11.12]Alright, I'm closing it in 10 seconds.
[106:18.12]Poison and bone it is.
[106:20.44]Okay.
[106:26.50]Remember, I'll show you again what we have available here.
[106:34.65]Teeth.
[106:36.91]Bone armor.
[106:39.09]Poison dagger.
[106:42.30]That is what's currently available right now.
[106:46.60]God damn it.
[106:47.70]Whatever.
[106:47.98]Alright, what do you want?
[106:50.92]It's up to you.
[106:53.46]Nice background.
[106:59.95]Whatever.
[107:09.76]Hey, Jeremiah, I don't mean to backseat, but this is not a good build.
[107:17.76]Really?
[107:18.06]Damn.
[107:20.51]I thought this was going to be really good.
[107:23.03]I thought I was going to be able to get the first boss.
[107:26.17]Alright, let's do teeth.
[107:26.81]Good choice.
[107:28.21]Except, not really.
[107:29.89]Because I have no mana.
[107:36.07]So how the hell am I going to cast this?
[107:41.10]Two teeth come out.
[107:41.82]It does two to four damage.
[107:49.19]Now... Here we go.
[107:53.35]Here are my current stats right now.
[107:54.65]Just to make sure you guys see that what damage you're going to see is a little outdated.
[107:57.13]Okay.
[108:02.75]Take a stat.
[108:07.97]You're using the F keys.
[108:08.89]You have to.
[108:15.52]Alright, alright.
[108:17.16]Not bad decisions so far.
[108:19.34]Not bad.
[108:20.06]Could be way worse.
[108:33.55]Energy sucks.
[108:40.11]Alright, alright.
[108:43.67]Five points are going in energy.
[108:44.83]Let's go.
[108:47.10]Thanks for voting.
[108:49.10]Let's do it.
[108:58.46]Let me repair.
[108:59.44]And... Okay, so this is a very dangerous portal, right?
[109:02.84]This portal will kill me.
[109:09.21]I have to be careful.
[109:14.14]I'm going to make a portal immediately when going through this portal.
[109:17.24]And we're going to cast teeth at you.
[109:21.95]Let's do it.
[109:23.39]3, 2, 1, go.
[109:37.08]Dude, fog.
[109:37.98]I have to level up again?
[109:44.53]Wait, why am I leveling up so fast?
[109:46.31]Wait, what?
[109:47.03]What just happened?
[109:53.73]How did I level up so fast?
[110:01.29]Is he cheating?
[110:02.43]Am I?
[110:02.71]I don't think so.
[110:14.00]How we doing?
[110:14.36]Skeleton Doll alive?
[110:15.04]This is how you got banned.
[110:21.61]I was so pissed off when I saw that.
[110:26.42]And I can't even get another CD key.
[110:28.08]That's the worst part.
[110:28.80]I have to buy the game and send it to somebody else.
[110:34.14]But then they have to open it and give me their CD key.
[110:50.93]Make a new account.
[110:52.03]Yeah, I would have to make a brand new account on Battle.net to buy Diablo II again.
[110:57.03]Alright, this is going really well.
[111:09.99]I'm going to make a prediction.
[111:12.09]I'm going to beat Andariel.
[111:15.55]He's the first major boss of the game.
[111:16.95]By the way, we're probably going to get a first unique of the game.
[111:18.77]We should be excited about that.
[111:25.48]It's gonna be very hectic.
[111:26.46]I'm gonna be very scared.
[111:28.65]It's okay.
[111:29.05]Because I'll have a couple of friends.
[111:39.99]Large axe.
[111:42.33]35 strength.
[111:43.77]Can't use it.
[111:46.77]I do more damage just by swinging because I have so much strength.
[111:49.61]Okay, so this is why this is so dumb.
[111:52.14]So you pick teeth, which is fine.
[111:54.70]But I do more damage by swinging because I have 30 strength.
[111:59.38]So...
[112:07.73]I may as well put on that two-handed weapon.
[112:10.71]You know what I mean?
[112:11.43]At this point, it's sort of a lost cause.
[112:15.75]We're going to have multiple points.
[112:22.50]Your hit rate is 10%.
[112:25.68]Yeah, that's right.
[112:26.40]Alright, Darkwood, here we are.
[112:29.94]Get this out of here.
[112:30.48]I don't want this.
[112:34.19]Now we're looking for the tree.
[112:42.78]Get away from me.
[112:43.48]There's somebody with electricity in it.
[112:45.36]Somebody with electricity.
[112:45.98]Electricity is the worst thing in the whole game.
[112:47.58]Who has electricity?
[112:49.64]Who has electricity on him?
[112:50.70]I don't see anybody in there with electricity, but why did that come up?
[113:00.66]Who has it?
[113:01.50]Yep, there's somebody in there that has it.
[113:02.91]I see them.
[113:04.68]Oh my god.
[113:06.40]Okay, run.
[113:10.96]One skeleton?
[113:11.58]That's not good.
[113:12.28]We're good, we're good.
[113:27.53]Don't get hit by the lightning.
[113:30.03]I gotta kill this shaman somewhere.
[113:31.41]There you are.
[113:31.83]There's two shamans.
[113:38.92]It's too stressful.
[113:40.16]Why do I want to do this?
[113:42.77]This is too stressful.
[113:43.79]It really is.
[113:44.93]Especially when you get a little bit later here.
[113:54.21]I have to kill the guys with the staffs.
[114:05.65]Help me, skeleton!
[114:06.81]Alright, he's one dead.
[114:10.83]Where's my golem?
[114:13.99]Alright, my golem is... He's doing a good job.
[114:16.49]He's currently surrounded.
[114:17.23]Do you have mana?
[114:19.37]What?
[114:19.81]Where?
[114:20.67]Okay.
[114:21.31]Where's another shaman?
[114:21.85]Shaman dead?
[114:24.94]There you are.
[114:26.00]Oh, you motherfuckers.
[114:27.08]This is ridiculous.
[114:28.64]Oh my god.
[114:36.64]This is a mess.
[114:38.46]This is an actual mess.
[114:39.82]I have to leave and level up again, I think.
[114:49.81]Yep.
[114:50.47]Get out.
[114:53.38]Get out, get out, get out, get out.
[114:55.34]No.
[114:55.84]What?
[114:56.20]Yeah, actually, put a safe teleporter down here.
[115:06.21]Okay.
[115:07.07]Do I have any money?
[115:08.19]Get rid of this.
[115:10.79]No, saw.
[115:11.17]Wait.
[115:11.35]22 attack rating.
[115:14.33]Should I just put it in?
[115:15.01]Who cares?
[115:17.02]Alright.
[115:18.24]I need load up potions.
[115:21.22]How many do I have?
[115:21.92]I'll get some more.
[115:27.28]Okay.
[115:27.74]What level are we now?
[115:28.48]We are level 8.
[115:30.74]We have opened up a couple of new things.
[115:35.03]because you put a point to teeth one point is in teeth right now at three you know it just increases the amount of teeth and the amount of damage armor as well there's corpse explosion cast on the corpse of a slain monster it explodes damaging nearby enemies okay pretty good poison dagger that's what's available in poison and bone
[115:59.35]We still have the same curses available, Amplify and Dim Vision, and we still have the same summoning abilities.
[116:05.40]You do not get new ones until level 12.
[116:06.88]Scroll over so you can see what would happen if I put a point into these.
[116:21.04]Okay.
[116:23.43]Alright.
[116:24.21]So you've seen it.
[116:25.61]Please choose a category.
[116:31.18]If you would.
[116:35.78]He thinks anyone cares.
[116:40.66]Well, I mean, that's kind of the point of the stream.
[116:44.13]Is to have people pick something crazy for hardcore.
[116:47.53]He thinks anyone cares.
[116:51.19]Don't be so mean.
[116:51.95]Why are you being so mean?
[117:04.93]Okay.
[117:07.07]Kind of torn, but it looks like summoning.
[117:08.27]Okay, good.
[117:14.91]Alright.
[117:16.05]We're still in summoning, so you only have three choices here.
[117:19.39]Two into Clay Golem, another one into... You only have three options.
[117:23.67]Go ahead and pick one.
[117:32.54]Well, that's 100%.
[117:35.64]This will make four skeletons.
[117:38.38]He's going to start crying.
[117:44.88]Well, there's no coming back from this.
[117:47.88]76% won another skeleton.
[117:53.29]Okay.
[117:54.55]Let's go.
[118:02.34]This will be a level of six points into skeleton, which will get us to four skeletons.
[118:11.05]It is now time to choose some... Well, I'll show you here.
[118:13.03]Here's where the stats currently stand.
[118:14.73]30, 25, 30, 30.
[118:15.29]A... 30, 25, 30, 30.
[118:15.51]Those are where the stats are right now.
[118:20.98]Where am I going?
[118:45.72]Okay.
[118:45.88]You know, I've never done anything like this before in this game, so this is kind of an interesting... I mean, I guess I can hit things harder.
[119:01.73]Does that... Well, I'll be able to wear some really, really heavy armor.
[119:10.06]Okay.
[119:12.42]Five points into strength it is.
[119:14.82]Thanks for voting, everybody.
[119:16.97]That'll bring us to... 35 strength.
[119:20.35]Can I, uh... One to- look at the- okay.
[119:33.61]1 to 27 damage.
[119:34.03]That is so terrible.
[119:45.59]Alright, let's bring... Let's resurrect Kyle.
[119:48.93]Alright, we need to... How many... What do I have for... Alright, let me get some more portals.
[119:54.88]I only have one.
[119:55.40]Okay, I feel safe now.
[120:07.42]Fresh.
[120:08.36]I can get four skeletons.
[120:15.15]Can I resurrect anybody here?
[120:16.27]No.
[120:16.63]Alright.
[120:17.75]Let's go.
[120:18.55]Three, two, one.
[120:20.05]Let's go.
[120:31.47]Oh my god.
[120:31.95]Don't do it.
[120:38.08]The champion's almost dead.
[120:44.54]Get in there.
[120:44.98]What are you doing?
[120:45.80]Get in there.
[120:50.05]He's just standing around.
[120:51.03]Get in the fight.
[120:57.21]She's still alive?
[121:02.42]She's in here somewhere.
[121:04.46]Is she dead?
[121:05.12]I don't know.
[121:06.74]Just kill the archers.
[121:19.63]Dude, I can't even walk over there.
[121:28.02]Don't, please.
[121:33.32]Kill her.
[121:34.37]Kill.
[121:35.19]Demon lightning enchant is the worst.
[121:42.97]Die.
[121:45.19]I leveled up again.
[121:49.69]Nice.
[121:50.15]Good work.
[121:53.82]This hard leather armor here.
[121:54.92]God damn it.
[121:56.56]I didn't mean to do that.
[121:59.06]Fifteen.
[121:59.98]Two strength.
[122:01.88]What's he got?
[122:02.58]Twenty-one defense.
[122:03.48]I'd rather have that than health.
[122:15.31]You see what?
[122:15.83]Okay.
[122:15.95]Go ahead.
[122:30.73]If I put on the huge axe, I lose a skeleton.
[122:33.29]That's true.
[122:35.23]Keep that in mind.
[122:39.72]Do Bugleberry right now or Riot.
[122:45.58]I'm not going to do that.
[122:48.50]Okay.
[122:50.94]You do have another point to put in.
[122:53.71]Let's go ahead and do this first.
[123:00.97]I mean, if you... Look.
[123:04.59]If you're gonna make me do this, then I have... Look at 2 to 5.
[123:06.47]2 to 40.
[123:06.63]That's... This is good.
[123:08.98]But I lost a skeleton.
[123:19.30]Here's what's available.
[123:20.06]The same ones from last time, obviously.
[123:21.96]Corpse Explosion, Teeth, Bone Armor, Skeleton, which we lost it because we had plus one from the Wand.
[123:30.33]And also one and one in Skeleton Mastery and in Clayton.
[123:34.55]Please choose a category if you would.
[123:38.37]I'd appreciate it.
[123:51.47]We lost a friend.
[123:52.75]Bring back friend.
[123:54.33]Yeah.
[123:56.97]Use that skill point and compensate.
[124:00.51]I'm actually going to be pretty useful, though.
[124:06.09]Okay.
[124:06.47]Well, what do you want to up?
[124:10.09]You could do skeleton mastery, clay golem, or replace the skeleton that we just lost.
[124:25.49]You're going to get clapped in the dirt before Endario.
[124:32.05]I don't think so.
[124:37.63]Okay.
[124:46.77]Four skeletons.
[124:48.33]This is what they currently have for a bonus.
[124:53.48]We are level nine.
[124:54.32]Let's go.
[124:56.29]How slow is this?
[125:03.98]It's pretty slow.
[125:05.06]But I feel like it's going to be kind of good.
[125:06.46]I'm going to look for the tree.
[125:13.80]This thing actually kind of... Don't get surrounded.
[125:19.81]There's too many people.
[125:22.29]I'm one-hit killing everything, though.
[125:24.03]So it's not terrible.
[125:28.38]He's not picking up the gold.
[125:30.72]I'm trying to stay alive.
[125:31.74]Actually, not that bad.
[125:37.52]Swolemancer.
[125:39.10]Oh, she leveled up.
[125:57.04]Grand Charm, get it.
[125:57.78]He's running around with a two-handed sword as a natural answer.
[126:07.63]Alright, let's keep going.
[126:11.27]We need to find the tree.
[126:13.35]And when I find the tree, it's instantly run away from the tree.
[126:18.41]Because you're guaranteed to die if you do not run instantly away from the tree.
[126:32.44]The tree is scary.
[126:33.22]Yes, it is.
[126:40.54]Carge?
[126:41.00]No, I don't want it.
[126:46.03]Tree fist is gonna kill him.
[126:47.27]Don't say that, because it's potentially accurate.
[127:00.85]It's so scary when you find the tree because they just sprint at you.
[127:05.86]Alright, that's good.
[127:18.95]Six to life.
[127:21.35]What do I have right now?
[127:22.37]Is it strength?
[127:23.07]No, keep the strength on.
[127:31.55]Trying to pay attention to him.
[127:35.96]He's still... Still... It was like a week ago, but he's still recovering.
[127:43.00]He's okay.
[127:44.84]Show us that... If I don't see at least a thousand cog champs right now, I will turn the stream off.
[127:51.49]I'm going to count...
[128:01.06]I am overburdened.
[128:02.92]Nice work.
[128:03.26]I knew you guys could do it.
[128:07.35]Ooh, they're terrible.
[128:08.73]10% faster.
[128:10.49]One to dexterity.
[128:11.29]At least it's cold resistance.
[128:15.85]Better than what I had on.
[128:16.67]I have six cold resist.
[128:19.55]Holy fuck, that's a lot of pogs.
[128:21.80]Alright, give me the gold.
[128:24.70]People are yelling at me for not picking up the gold.
[128:26.30]Yes, I know.
[128:26.98]I agree.
[128:29.02]I need it.
[128:35.22]I'm gonna put another, uh, I just need another pug.
[128:38.96]I don't know why.
[128:44.94]Give Kyle stuff.
[128:48.96]No, I'm gonna dump Kyle pretty soon here.
[128:52.60]Large axe?
[128:56.54]Alright, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[128:58.22]What do I have?
[129:00.70]Um... This shit's...
[129:11.86]He hates Kyle.
[129:12.84]No, I don't.
[129:13.28]Level up.
[129:21.01]This actually might make Andariel easier.
[129:25.77]Because I can actually swing.
[129:30.32]And I'm going to do damage.
[129:32.68]I'm not scared at the moment.
[129:34.64]I will be in a little bit, though.
[129:40.41]Playpoint, thank god.
[129:41.27]Alright, give me a second.
[129:48.87]It's all part of the plan.
[129:49.75]Trust chat.
[129:52.51]Well, it's hard to do that.
[129:53.35]Alright, I still have no sockets, right?
[129:59.83]When I get the cube, you can eventually combine these, but they're going to be worthless in about 40 minutes.
[130:07.21]How many keys do I have?
[130:08.05]I don't want to
[130:13.23]There's too many mana potions.
[130:14.44]Why do I even have these?
[130:18.00]It's absolutely useless.
[130:21.30]Oops.
[130:26.92]Dude, two minutes of gameplay, ten minutes to level it up?
[130:29.70]Yeah, you know it!
[130:30.62]Let's go!
[130:31.06]Alright, well, we got this.
[130:37.97]We got the same choices.
[130:41.55]Same choices are available.
[130:43.66]We still have four skeletons.
[130:44.98]Skeleton Mastery is available.
[130:46.26]Golem is available.
[130:48.46]We still have Corpse Explosion, which is available.
[130:50.34]Bone Armor.
[130:52.00]Poison Dagger.
[130:53.96]There's still Curses available.
[130:59.47]Here's what will happen if you put a point into this.
[131:01.89]Damage goes up by a little bit.
[131:04.95]It also happens here.
[131:05.73]Increases life and damage of raised skeletons and revived creatures.
[131:10.66]And then Amplify Damage is incredible, but it's not my choice.
[131:14.22]Okay, go ahead and pick.
[131:17.60]These will start slowing down as we level up, though.
[131:21.33]So don't worry.
[131:31.73]As always, it looks like we're going to Skeletons.
[131:40.95]are we or do I just assume the worst okay well we're on the right page uh which one okay alright alright okay okay
[132:06.89]Corpse Explosion, ResidentSleeper, Skeleton Population Explosion, PogChamp.
[132:15.85]It is going into Skeleton Mastery.
[132:22.87]Okay.
[132:25.39]Uh, what about stats?
[132:26.13]Strength, Dexterity, Vitality, Energy.
[132:31.14]Which one?
[132:48.92]Getting smarter.
[132:49.68]They're getting smarter.
[132:51.52]That's good.
[132:59.40]Okay.
[133:01.98]No, I'm not.
[133:02.63]Yes, you are.
[133:03.21]Don't downplay yourself.
[133:05.29]You just pick the one that is good.
[133:06.99]Alright.
[133:17.59]So, we're doing Skeleton Mastery, which will go up from life to 8%.
[133:21.25]This is just doubling their life.
[133:23.85]Potentially.
[133:26.28]Damage.
[133:26.74]So, now let's see.
[133:27.50]What do they do?
[133:28.30]3 to 5 damage.
[133:29.58]And they have 60 health.
[133:30.70]6 to 7 damage.
[133:34.54]And they have 68 health.
[133:35.80]So, now they're going to be pretty good.
[133:39.20]Not a terrible play.
[133:41.20]And then... Vitality.
[133:47.98]Everything else looks good.
[133:50.06]Let's go.
[133:55.65]Dude, Pog.
[133:56.41]Three minutes of gameplay.
[133:57.33]Here it comes.
[133:57.77]Pog.
[134:07.28]Magic find is really good, but I'll keep the strength on.
[134:13.16]Oh shit, watch out.
[134:15.00]He's a chump.
[134:16.18]Let's kill him.
[134:21.68]Best opportunity to get rares and uniques is from named enemies, obviously, right?
[134:36.05]Fucking ResidentSleeper gameplay.
[134:37.95]What is this shit?
[134:39.39]I want to see you level it up.
[134:45.90]Where's the tree?
[134:47.86]I think it's right over here.
[134:51.52]Stamina Shrine, good.
[134:52.90]Very useful, let's go.
[134:55.48]Don't get overwhelmed.
[134:57.81]Tree, tree, tree, tree, tree.
[135:09.73]Still no tree.
[135:11.27]This house is burning, but... Tree!
[135:19.82]I would take that skill shrine, but I don't want it because I want to be able to run.
[135:27.36]Where the hell is it?
[135:27.91]I got the waypoint.
[135:31.87]What's the over-under on me screaming when tree fist appears?
[135:35.91]It depends.
[135:37.55]Does the game lag and does he instantly teleport next to me?
[135:42.44]Is that what happens?
[135:46.92]Probably this way.
[135:50.06]Depends on who sees who first.
[135:52.09]Yes, it does.
[135:54.43]Alright, slow down.
[135:55.93]I need another skeleton.
[135:59.28]There he is, there he is.
[136:00.10]Okay, yeah, alright.
[136:02.10]There he is, there he is.
[136:03.16]I didn't scream.
[136:03.92]I didn't scream.
[136:12.95]He's not even that bad.
[136:13.67]He's fine.
[136:16.01]This is fine.
[136:16.83]I'm good.
[136:19.85]He walked right into the... Okay, he just got destroyed.
[136:24.99]That wouldn't even... That wouldn't even scare him.
[136:27.26]That was easy.
[136:28.24]There's the tree.
[136:29.22]What did he drop?
[136:33.42]Anything good?
[136:45.54]Am I already?
[136:49.20]Free defense.
[136:50.08]That sucks.
[136:51.42]Pen?
[136:52.68]No, I'll keep that on.
[136:53.60]You wear this.
[136:55.17]There's a scroll.
[136:58.53]Look at all these potions I have.
[136:59.83]What a waste of space.
[137:02.13]Waste of space these are.
[137:03.77]Alright, I'm gonna sell some shit.
[137:09.29]Alright, now we gotta go to Stonyfield and go to Tristram and hopefully not lose.
[137:15.38]Hey, are you winning?
[137:20.21]Are you winning?
[137:24.89]Yes, we do.
[137:26.73]Go to the cairn stones in the stony field.
[137:31.27]Touch the stones in the order of the scroll.
[137:36.13]What was the thing everyone was saying?
[137:37.51]Well, there was at least a few people that said, will he get past Rakanishu?
[137:44.03]This is the real test, I think.
[137:46.95]Coming up right now.
[137:47.65]Alright, let's get rid of some of this shit.
[137:48.93]Like, get out of here.
[137:53.90]Put the magic find on instead.
[137:55.50]Sure.
[137:58.86]Okay.
[138:07.51]Stash some of this shit.
[138:21.09]Should I keep this stuff on?
[138:22.23]Eh, it's fine.
[138:25.25]Okay.
[138:26.55]Now we have to go to the Stony Field, which is further back.
[138:31.06]Coal Plains, Stony Field.
[138:32.82]I think I already did it.
[138:33.40]I found it, didn't I, already, before?
[138:34.60]Yeah, it's right down here.
[138:38.56]Look at that.
[138:39.20]We're already ready to go.
[138:41.46]Wrong.
[138:46.43]Did I do the Countess?
[138:48.27]I did not.
[138:50.74]I may skip the Countess and go right for Enderrealm.
[138:54.49]I know that's a terrible idea, but sometimes you gotta go for the hard play.
[139:02.41]Look at the stony field.
[139:03.95]Oh, EXP shrine.
[139:05.13]Kill.
[139:05.33]Come on.
[139:09.19]You get like triple the amount of experience.
[139:18.25]How do I have no stamina?
[139:20.39]Doesn't make any sense.
[139:23.26]Kill something quick, please.
[139:24.12]I gotta get back on the road.
[139:30.64]He's got- count his skip equal- equals skipping levels.
[139:34.15]Yeah.
[139:38.91]I mean, the- the end of Act 1... is actually pretty hard.
[139:44.05]It is.
[139:47.76]Is this Stonyfield or is this Burial Grounds?
[139:53.67]Is that Burial Grounds?
[139:55.63]It's Burial Grounds.
[139:56.15]Alright, it's up there.
[139:57.33]Hold on, I gotta stand still so my stupid ass stamina can refill.
[140:01.94]Why don't you stack stamina potions?
[140:03.14]Because I forgot that we have 40 points in strength.
[140:07.28]I forgot.
[140:23.82]Go, go, go, go, go.
[140:26.28]Pause the game.
[140:26.80]I have to go.
[140:27.18]There is no pause in Diablo.
[140:29.12]Yes, there is.
[140:30.31]What?
[140:30.77]Oh, I'm not playing online.
[140:31.71]Right.
[140:36.53]Yeah, there is.
[140:37.21]Pause the game.
[140:39.47]Not yet.
[140:40.51]Our first break is coming soon.
[140:43.90]After I go through Tristram, we'll do our first break.
[140:48.82]I'm in it for the long haul tonight, guys.
[140:50.68]I want to see just how far I can get.
[140:52.48]Before reliably turning the stream off and being safe.
[140:59.51]Pause.
[141:00.03]What about my pizza roll?
[141:02.73]You'll be okay.
[141:03.09]Looking for the stones.
[141:06.79]You'll know when I find the stones when you see a blue guy.
[141:11.31]Looking for the blue guy.
[141:25.93]Give me that.
[141:26.25]I'd rather have that right now.
[141:28.32]Who cares about the experience?
[141:29.22]I'll get it.
[141:31.82]Stones, stones.
[141:32.98]Found it.
[141:33.24]Okay, okay.
[141:33.88]Run, run, run, run, run.

[143:23.42]So, I gotta be careful.

[143:26.32]Nope.
[143:27.74]Actually, I did that.
[143:30.12]Oh, that's right.
[143:30.68]This thing has a 5% chance to amplify damage.

[144:56.36]Alright, here we go.
[144:58.62]Where's work?

[145:14.23]One to twenty seven.
[145:16.91]I could... Alright, I might actually use this.
[145:25.76]I might just put, like, three gems in it.
[145:37.30]Go get Deckard Kane.
[145:42.67]He's in here, surrounded by people.
[145:44.35]HELP!
[145:46.03]HELP!
[145:50.42]Deckard Cain, move quickly.
[145:52.65]And that's Barbarian.
[145:53.71]Wrong person.
[145:55.61]Where is he?
[146:03.34]He didn't even say the rest.
[146:19.04]Good, good, good, good, good.
[146:20.32]Alright, we got two levels up.
[146:27.87]Am I level 10?
[146:29.47]Level 12!
[146:29.77]Wow, we're moving right along.
[146:32.03]Level 12?
[146:32.51]Are you kidding me?
[146:34.33]This is fucking easy.
[146:38.17]It's not even fucking hard.
[146:39.65]Alright, let's get out.
[146:50.68]I get a lot of redeeming.
[146:51.48]We made it.
[146:52.34]Here he is.
[146:57.53]Regrettably, I could do nothing to... I play this game every day.
[147:01.23]Our greatest fear has come to pass.
[147:21.72]Chat has made a necromancer with 40 strength.
[147:23.16]You might as well just go home.
[147:24.82]Let one of the adults take over.
[147:26.18]There's no way you can beat Diablo with that shit, Bill.
[147:52.60]Alright, bye.
[147:53.08]Hey, I ate some food and you're still alive.
[147:54.68]Good job.
[147:55.23]Yeah, we're doing fine.
[147:56.89]Oh yeah, you get a ring for doing this.
[147:58.81]And it always just sucks.
[148:01.33]Nice magic damage reduced by one.
[148:19.82]There's probably more nutritional value inside that ring from a box of Lucky Charms.
[148:26.53]You know what I'm trying to say.
[148:27.27]Alright, let's sell.
[148:28.97]And we got what Levels Up to do.
[148:31.43]And we're going for it.
[148:32.27]We're going for Undariel.
[148:33.19]Fuck it.
[148:33.89]We're going right for it.
[148:34.69]This is where it gets hard.
[148:45.81]I have a Keyport's Leg.
[148:52.21]It's time to gamble.
[148:57.01]He's getting too confident.
[148:59.89]It's fine.
[149:02.33]Hey, Geed.
[149:03.73]Good day to you, partner.
[149:05.83]I'm Geed.
[149:06.78]Oh.
[149:08.42]He didn't even do it.
[149:09.48]Gambling is you don't know what it is, but it could be a rare.
[149:22.82]I have $5,000.
[149:23.24]What do I need to replace?
[149:26.44]This is shit.
[149:28.06]Belt?
[149:28.42]Should I try to get a better belt?
[149:33.26]I still have gloves.
[149:34.32]These gloves are so bad.
[149:35.36]Gloves.
[149:35.66]Alright, that was bad.
[149:47.23]Heavy armor?
[149:48.25]Yeah, I can wear it, can't I?
[149:50.47]I think I can wear it.
[149:52.62]Sword?
[149:52.98]Should I go for a sword?
[150:01.75]Or a club?
[150:02.91]Rings?
[150:03.19]The rings are 63,000 gold each.
[150:07.59]New armor.
[150:10.43]Yeah, let's see if we can get some armor.
[150:11.70]Alright, chain mail.
[150:13.78]18,000.
[150:13.80]Alright, here we go.
[150:15.76]I don't have enough money.
[150:19.92]This shit just drops on the ground.
[150:22.90]Does he hate the music that I should be turned up?
[150:33.06]Oh, I want this.
[150:33.86]Alright, that's better.
[150:36.30]Now I'll have more slots.
[150:38.40]Seven life, three mana.
[150:39.18]Let's go.
[150:39.84]See, that was worth it.
[150:41.46]Alright, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
[150:50.26]put this shit in here my favorite part about this game is organizing gems it's just somehow satisfying to me alright we got potions I need another row yeah I'm gonna just buy like two or three wait I'm just I'm buying back the ones I sold what the fuck is going on
[151:25.67]Alright, so we have 10 stat points to put in.
[151:30.92]Where do you want me to put 10 stat points?
[151:34.50]We're doing them all.
[151:36.54]10 points.
[151:37.00]Where do you want them?
[151:38.18]Take a look.
[151:38.50]That's what it looks like.
[151:46.37]Which one?
[152:07.21]mountains any mountains hey Otto what are you doing over there any any mountain fans in here alright ten points are going to strength I'm gonna be the heaviest acrobanza ever
[152:36.36]Okay.
[152:37.50]What about, uh, we have two points.
[152:40.70]Let's take a look at what we have in some new stuff, though.
[152:43.50]So, check it out.
[152:45.59]First, let's do this.
[152:51.09]That was painful to do.
[152:54.87]So, we have a couple of new things here.
[152:58.99]Again, we have, uh, here's what happens with Rey's skeleton.
[153:01.49]We have skeleton mastery still.
[153:03.84]We do not get a fifth skeleton.
[153:08.61]Play Golem.
[153:09.77]We've... Golem Mastery has unlocked.
[153:13.53]Enhances speed and life of your golems.
[153:16.50]More health and more attack.
[153:18.44]And they walk faster.
[153:21.98]Or Skeleton Mage.
[153:25.28]Just like regular skeleton, it revives a... This adds to your skeleton pool.
[153:30.33]And it's a mage, not melee.
[153:32.21]It shoots ice, fire, lightning...
[153:35.51]etc they're a lot weaker but they still get skeleton mastery still get a bonus from this uh you can't do anything here because no one's picking anything here
[153:53.60]This all remains the same.
[153:54.70]Poison dagger, teeth, bone armor is the same.
[153:57.12]Curses has not been clicked on once, so we can't go further down.
[154:00.70]But if you did, this weaken, which makes everybody that you touch with this do 33% less damage.
[154:08.55]This iron maiden, which when they do damage, it hurts themselves.
[154:13.93]It's a thorns.
[154:15.35]So they do 200% damage returned back at them.
[154:19.95]Terror just makes people run away.
[154:23.09]Nobody wants to do curses, apparently.
[154:24.77]So.
[154:26.15]And now that you see these, you know what they do.
[154:28.19]Where would you like to go?
[154:31.85]This is for the first point, by the way.
[154:34.13]Please pick the category.
[154:48.82]People are already clicking it.
[154:50.10]Watch out.
[154:53.32]Hey, you.
[154:55.00]Hey, you little... Hey, you little dork.
[154:58.48]Alright.
[155:01.62]Okay, we're on skeletons.
[155:04.39]We're on summoning spells already, and that's where you want to go.
[155:07.17]Which one?
[155:07.59]Okay.
[155:20.57]Okay.
[155:23.63]Skeleton mage it is.
[155:24.37]So that's the first point.
[155:29.25]Where would you like the second point?
[155:32.53]What category?
[155:39.04]Or we just do it again.
[155:45.68]I guess we already know.
[155:49.23]I guess we already know.
[155:52.71]Hey, dude, great Necro build!
[155:56.09]This actually is not even that different than just making a summoning build anyway, so... Not too big of a problem.
[156:05.34]Okay.
[156:07.94]We're doing another point into Skeleton Mage.
[156:12.22]See, a lot of you guys think you're doing some crazy, weird, impossible build, but you're just going to make it hard for me to beat bosses, and then I'll have to figure it out on my own.
[156:23.85]So, we've got Skeletal Mage.
[156:26.00]One.
[156:26.76]Skeletal... Uh-oh.
[156:29.82]We have to be level 13 for this one.
[156:33.04]Uh-oh.
[156:41.43]Take something else.
[156:55.24]Now you could save points too.
[156:57.56]You don't have to spend them until you figure out what you want to do.
[157:00.52]You don't have to spend them right now.
[157:06.70]But we can do curses.
[157:09.03]Okay.
[157:10.37]Don't influence us.
[157:11.77]I'm just saying you don't have to spend your points until maybe you figure out what you want to do.
[157:15.41]You don't have to spend every point.
[157:21.63]Alright, so just to refresh your memory because this is an inaccurate list.
[157:26.18]Very currently available curses.
[157:29.64]Dim vision and amplify damage.
[157:33.02]Everything takes 100% more damage.
[157:35.28]Or make them so they can't see very well.
[157:40.91]Any mountain fans in the area?
[157:44.87]Which one?
[157:59.61]Curses equal lame.
[158:01.09]Well, it depends how you use them.
[158:05.81]This actually will be very, very good.
[158:13.40]Okay.
[158:14.70]Good choice.
[158:16.58]And I mean that actually.
[158:18.08]I don't mean that as a joke.
[158:19.14]That's actually a really good thing to have with summoning build.
[158:26.02]Put it on the bar.
[158:27.12]I've got a couple things to put on the bar.
[158:29.58]So we're going to do F1.
[158:33.35]And then 2, F3, F4.
[158:35.13]Okay.
[158:41.19]We have a Skeletal Mage now we can summon, which is a different button.
[158:45.06]I'm also going to go P. So let's take a quick little break for the first time.
[158:48.90]I will be right back, and we'll continue.
[158:50.40]Be right back.
[158:55.68]Thank you.
[161:43.08]Thank you.
[162:24.86]Thank you.
[165:42.08]Okay, sorry about that.
[165:43.10]I need to take care of Otto.
[165:50.48]Make sure he was doing okay.
[165:55.26]Alright, we've selected everything, right?
[165:57.22]I'm going to keep an eye on him.
[166:02.74]He's my special boy.
[166:03.69]Alright, let's go.
[166:14.52]uh what there we go alright what was on tap here I don't remember I'm dario greetings when I fled the monastery alright malice my enchanted smithing hammer if you can retrieve it for me I'll use its magic to strengthen your equipment
[166:40.06]Okay, so... This is so odd seeing this as a fucking necromancer.
[166:47.74]Oh, we did that one.
[166:49.10]We could do this, but nah.
[166:50.28]We don't need it.
[166:52.78]This is on the way.
[166:56.40]Idiot streamer sucks at Diablo.
[167:00.80]We gotta get...
[167:08.39]I need... Okay, we gotta go from here to here.
[167:11.11]It's gonna be quite a journey.
[167:13.32]Do all quests with an angry face.
[167:19.06]We don't need... I'll go back and do them.
[167:24.86]Alright, we're looking for the... What's it called?
[167:33.51]The Black Marsh?
[167:37.49]The one.
[167:40.39]Ooh, a ring.
[167:45.13]Oh, yeah.
[167:48.09]Light radius and attack rating.
[167:49.35]That's good.
[167:51.12]Why are there so many skeletons?
[167:53.02]Well, because Chat wants to have Chat on screen.
[167:59.88]There's going to be a bunch of them.
[168:04.75]Somebody redeemed a wing?
[168:05.71]No, they didn't.
[168:07.85]Not right now.
[168:09.19]Did they?
[168:09.47]Did they?
[168:36.52]Oh, it was fucking fake.
[168:38.28]God damn it.
[168:42.36]I need to- I need a way to track that on my own screen, seriously.
[168:46.84]I have to- I guess I gotta track that, otherwise people will just keep doing that forever.
[168:53.78]Alright, with me, with me, with me, with me, with me.
[168:57.82]Black Marsh.
[168:59.90]We're making a run for it.
[169:03.36]Read the chat.
[169:05.49]Um, but when there's 5,000 people in the chatroom, and somebody redeems a wink, and one second goes by, it might be off the screen.
[169:17.95]So I need a way to keep track of it.
[169:33.04]Oh, look, there's another one.
[169:34.76]Oh, really?
[169:35.26]No way.
[169:45.36]Come on, run on the edge.
[169:51.45]Damn it.
[169:55.59]No, there was no real wink.
[169:57.01]I would have saw it.
[169:57.65]It'll show up on my dashboard.
[170:03.20]that for real?
[170:06.21]Where reward requests?
[170:12.33]Is that it?
[170:12.77]Okay, reward request is currently on.
[170:25.94]I don't see anything.
[170:31.88]Don't ever alt-tab during a hardcore game.
[170:34.50]Seriously.
[170:34.92]I wonder if he's going to die to Andariel.
[170:39.88]No, no, no.
[170:40.16]I'm going to alt-tab and die to one random person hitting me.
[170:43.15]Alright, it's up there.
[170:58.66]I didn't bring very many of these.
[170:59.66]I only got one.
[171:02.64]I'm gonna go buy more of those.
[171:03.58]I'm gonna spend, like, all my money on it.
[171:07.41]Great.
[171:10.43]At least I have an army protecting me.
[171:12.11]Yeah, that's true.
[171:15.84]But if I go too far ahead of the army, and they don't teleport quick enough, I'm gonna die.
[171:24.56]Here we go.
[171:24.88]Black Marsh, right?
[171:25.81]Yes.
[171:34.66]Now, you really should get the waypoint, but the only waypoint that matters is Catacombs level 2.
[171:42.06]But this is hardcore, and you can't just die.
[171:44.00]So, I'm going to just hold on.
[171:45.92]I'm going to relax for a second.
[171:59.61]Neolink.
[172:09.47]That's pretty good.
[172:13.97]Lightning and poison resist.
[172:17.08]Block rate, 35% chance to block.
[172:19.18]Oh, I can't really use it.
[172:23.52]Wins the paladin scepter.
[172:24.64]Wait, that's a necromancer only item.
[172:31.33]No plus to skills, so it's absolutely worthless.
[172:37.97]I keep going.
[172:39.71]Is that a waypoint?
[172:45.66]Oh, you leveled up.
[172:49.66]Remember, there's a bug on your camera.
[172:52.96]Ugh!
[172:56.12]Ugh, fucking ew!
[173:02.78]Hey!
[173:02.88]Look, the waypoint.
[173:03.56]Alright, outer cloister.
[173:09.60]I think it's over.
[173:13.66]Nope.
[173:15.94]Kill the bug.
[173:16.56]Kill the bug.
[173:17.14]Kill the bug.
[173:19.34]No, this bug is going to live.
[173:22.91]You guys ever do that?
[173:23.49]You guys ever have a bug in your house?
[173:24.61]Like a spider or something?
[173:26.95]And it's in a spot where you know it's probably not going to bother you.
[173:29.75]And you just go, alright, man.
[173:32.01]You get to live.
[173:33.29]You stay there.
[173:37.15]You can just hang out up there.
[173:40.05]But if you don't do any encroachment, the further you come out with that web, the more chance that there is that I'm gonna- I'm gonna fucking get rid of it.
[173:47.41]Alright, that's- that's just, uh... Lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning.
[173:54.79]Careful.
[174:02.70]Oh, fucking people are dying.
[174:07.46]I'm so- Ooh!
[174:09.82]That's good.
[174:10.32]That's really good.
[174:10.98]Come on.
[174:12.44]Plus the skills.
[174:13.70]Plus the skills.
[174:14.38]Okay.
[174:21.63]+2 to corpse explosion.
[174:24.21]Plus one to weaken.
[174:25.55]Alright.
[174:30.13]But I lose my actual damage.
[174:31.89]Hold on.
[174:32.17]I'll look at that later.
[174:32.87]Okay.
[174:44.06]It's going to kill people around you.
[174:46.20]Why am I doing such a little damage to you?
[174:48.98]Alright, speaking of damage.
[174:56.53]I'm going to be doing that way more often.
[175:05.91]Amplified damage.
[175:06.68]2 to 40 damage is a hell of a range.
[175:08.14]Yeah, and it is.
[175:10.10]It is.
[175:15.46]Portal shrine.
[175:17.10]Pretty portal.
[175:18.30]We'll take it.
[175:31.39]Range damage really can kill you without... Wait on.
[175:36.79]I got to still get everybody with my troops, right?
[175:43.10]Love the bone squad we got going on right now.
[175:46.32]The ever-increasing... Wait, I got six people?
[175:52.34]I do feel a lot safer.
[175:55.84]Having six friends.
[175:57.14]Yeah, I can't play it online.
[176:00.39]But I can play with my pretend friends here.
[176:04.01]Alright.
[176:08.09]Monastery Gate.
[176:09.51]Oh, that sucks.
[176:25.79]But wait.
[176:26.70]Alright, give it to this.
[176:30.12]Talk it.
[176:32.78]Uh... Who cares about the man?
[176:40.82]This dude's been playing since the beta?
[176:43.86]Yeah, dude.
[176:44.97]Alright, this shit actually does get dangerous in here.
[176:48.11]This is like one of the first parts of the game that you can actually get truly, truly, truly broken.
[176:54.68]A lot of tiny little corridors.
[176:57.14]A lot of random people that just run through.
[176:59.48]Let's just stay alive.
[177:02.66]That's all it's about.
[177:03.98]Alright, so we're good.
[177:17.62]I do have to keep reminding myself that this is hardcore.
[177:23.27]I can't just... I have to be careful.
[177:31.52]Okay, there's a demon up there.
[177:38.78]We still got all of our friends, right?
[177:40.10]Yep.
[177:44.08]Fuck, I missed.
[177:44.52]Alright.
[177:45.42]Move.
[177:48.86]Move up.
[177:49.48]Move up.
[177:50.08]Let's move.
[177:51.28]Move.
[177:51.50]Move up.
[177:52.44]Are you guys being revived by something?
[177:56.90]Where is he?
[178:04.74]Alright, I was just going to say, oh thank god I got that in case I die.
[178:07.04]That's not how this works.
[178:10.38]Alright, easy.
[178:13.10]No control.
[178:13.34]Hold up.
[178:17.88]We're going to hold off on leveling up for a minute.
[178:22.82]I want to keep getting in.
[178:27.72]Just in case I die, I'll be able to run back.
[178:34.07]No, you won't.
[178:34.69]Because that's where the game ends.
[178:41.52]The butcher tube might kill me.
[178:43.40]No, I have to get through at least Act 1.
[178:48.54]Otherwise, what the hell?
[178:57.41]Lost my mage.
[179:08.08]When are you going to do Seaman 2?
[179:19.08]Is this Seaman 2?
[179:22.99]Wait, isn't... wait.
[179:23.83]Isn't that one Japanese only?
[179:28.31]And then only come out in Japan?
[179:37.68]How am I going to play it?
[179:38.94]There's no English version of it.
[179:52.24]You know where I really think I'm going to have a huge problem?
[179:55.96]The Arcane Sanctuary.
[180:01.20]That's the worst place in the whole game.
[180:09.37]If you don't play the Arcane Sanctuary with at least four people, life sucks.
[180:13.81]Okay, easy.
[180:23.34]In the barracks.
[180:30.43]I'm just running around sniping the Shaman.
[180:36.67]What?
[180:36.93]What the fuck?
[180:37.61]How did I take that much damage?
[180:51.30]I want them to go in first.
[180:52.94]I hate these little doors.
[181:17.42]This is the worst because you could just open a door and get hit three times and die.
[181:23.26]Are we good?
[181:30.27]Okay, we're good.
[181:34.49]22 gold, 23 gold.
[181:40.32]Looking for the jail level one.
[181:48.54]Okay, back up.
[181:49.40]I'm starting to get a little clenched.
[181:56.38]Just a little.
[181:57.02]All it takes is one person.
[182:17.60]Okay, what do we got?
[182:19.22]That's a lot of money.
[182:23.14]Hold on a second.
[182:24.18]I... I gotta do something about this.
[182:26.54]What about one guy?
[182:38.93]A lot of potions left.
[182:42.63]Tell the miners...
[182:51.19]this is such a weird build I have way more potions than I need why are all these rejuvenation potions dropping I don't remember this being a thing this feels weird and new I why are there so many rejuvenation potions
[183:19.44]Okay, just put this over here.
[183:22.16]I'm going to store this.
[183:33.03]Use him for the cube?
[183:35.71]That is right.
[183:36.19]Alright, what do we got for skill points here?
[183:40.38]We've unlocked Iron Maiden.
[183:44.40]I'm just saying.
[183:45.34]We've unlocked it.
[183:46.24]Here are the... We have Dominic's Bells.
[183:48.77]We still have the same amount.
[183:53.75]And then here's the Poisoned Bone.
[183:56.97]One point in teeth.
[183:58.45]Don't worry.
[183:58.83]It's not useless or anything.
[183:59.89]Alright.
[184:04.06]Where are we going?
[184:20.13]He's got one tooth.
[184:21.52]Looks like we're staying in the summoning tree.
[184:34.34]Everyone's got one good can-opening tooth.
[184:46.77]Alright, well, what are we doing in here?
[184:48.27]And by the way, if you put another point into Golem, it does not give you two Golems.
[184:51.86]It just makes your one Golem much better.
[184:53.60]I want to make sure everyone's aware of that.
[185:08.43]Remember, one Golem.
[185:14.99]Second Skeletal Mage.
[185:18.87]it's golem I know but ever since I was like 15 playing this game I just I say golem I know alright that's thanks for voting that's there's no way anything's coming back from that and what about stats is it bogus voting or am I unable to vote because I'm mobile I don't think extensions work on mobile
[185:47.16]So, I think that's probably what's going on.
[185:54.58]Some do.
[185:55.39]Yeah.
[186:01.55]Vitality.
[186:04.55]Still no points in Dex.
[186:06.35]But that's a... Actually, that's probably going to be a bad thing.
[186:10.22]If there's this many points in Strength already... I have Vitality.
[186:13.74]Thanks for voting.
[186:15.80]With this many points...
[186:18.97]Yeah.
[186:21.26]Alright, we're gonna get a second skeleton mage.
[186:26.08]Cool.
[186:27.50]And, uh... What was it?
[186:29.58]Vitality, right?
[186:30.28]Yeah.
[186:32.96]26 dexterity.
[186:33.60]Alright, five points.
[186:42.05]If I was a barbarian or something... No, this is a terrible build, whoever you are.
[186:45.91]Okay.
[186:47.99]Okay.
[186:51.33]Go.
[186:53.13]Make sure I've got everybody.
[186:59.94]One, two, three, four.
[187:01.00]So I got seven companions.
[187:06.42]Let's move.
[187:09.38]Gonna start to get messy very quickly.
[187:11.88]He's almost broken.
[187:24.03]Yell if on the mini-map you see a... Okay, something's in here.
[187:29.27]Go in.
[187:36.84]The only way to play hardcore.
[187:38.20]The guy who watches.
[187:42.94]Ooh, skullcap.
[187:48.64]Golem's in there.
[187:49.41]Everyone's alive still, so this is okay.
[187:52.47]Okay.
[187:57.62]Ring.
[187:58.89]Anything else?
[188:02.07]I want to check that skullcap.
[188:05.25]Everyone's still alive.
[188:05.87]We're fine.
[188:07.99]Let's take a look.
[188:11.79]Better.
[188:12.67]Stick to energy.
[188:13.33]That's pretty useful.
[188:16.25]And lightning resist.
[188:17.09]Yeah, put it on.
[188:17.97]Just better.
[188:19.40]Straight up.
[188:26.83]Alright, stay with me.
[188:31.46]What level am I?
[188:35.24]I'm 13.
[188:40.30]Potentially a little under-leveled for what is happening in the next section here.
[188:47.47]But, you know, sometimes you gotta go for it.
[189:01.37]I know you're 13.
[189:01.77]What level is your character?
[189:05.01]Yeah.
[189:08.65]You have to grind?
[189:13.84]I haven't had too much of a problem yet.
[189:18.28]If this starts to become a problem... This is still on player's set at 4, right?
[189:21.62]Yeah, it's at least 3 or 4.
[189:24.42]If this becomes a problem, then I will grind.
[189:30.63]Almost tricked him with that rank.
[189:32.47]Almost.
[189:42.66]Is playing hardcore in Diablo foolish if you've never played it before?
[189:47.35]Uh, yes.
[189:50.50]It's so easy to accidentally die in these games by just some random explosion.
[189:55.60]Or some random champion enemy that springs at you once and you die.
[189:58.18]Okay, speaking of kind of an insane room.
[190:03.73]People are dying.
[190:04.29]Come on.
[190:06.29]People are getting creamed.
[190:07.59]What is creaming everybody?
[190:13.87]Oh my god, people are dead.
[190:15.71]Get up here.
[190:16.11]Up, up, up.
[190:16.47]Back up, back up, back up.
[190:18.21]Golem's dead.
[190:26.52]no it's not the smith okay I'm sorry I probably just scared the shit out of everybody that was a mistake I forgot that what that did there's something in here what is in here that's causing so much damage they're all down the corner oh this is oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god this is where it ends this is where it ends alright maybe it's time to grind
[190:59.23]There's like five champions down there in the corner.
[191:05.15]I can't see.
[191:11.32]Everybody okay?
[191:22.56]Okay, this is bad.
[191:24.34]This is bad.
[191:24.82]Let him come to us.
[191:26.43]Alright, Larry, it's just me and you.
[191:29.03]I gotta move.
[191:29.43]We have to leave.
[191:31.13]I gotta get out.
[191:38.27]Okay, now we have to do the fun thing called be a necromancer.
[191:43.21]We're gonna go out to the Bloodmoor and we're gonna get a full party again.
[191:46.79]That's a wink.
[191:47.74]There is no wink.
[191:51.40]No, there's no... I can look... I can see it now.
[191:57.52]Yes, there is.
[191:58.08]No, there isn't.
[191:58.56]I'm looking right now.
[192:07.63]It was a scam.
[192:11.93]I like identifying on the fly, even if it's a waste of money, I know.
[192:16.43]Okay.
[192:16.79]Alright, let's...
[192:20.66]Get some new friends.
[192:21.26]Go gamble?
[192:33.69]I might in a second.
[192:37.75]And repair.
[192:38.30]Yep.
[192:38.62]Refilling shrine.
[192:39.34]Let's do it.
[192:40.92]That almost was very bad.
[192:48.92]Alright, just give me some... I need to just build my army back up before I go back in the door for them to instantly die.
[192:53.41]Alright, come on.
[192:58.81]Is that seriously the only body that's around here?
[193:00.97]How can that be the only body?
[193:01.97]There's gonna be a JermaWink Market Correction soon.
[193:10.08]Probably.
[193:11.78]Probably.
[193:22.52]Alright, Den of Evil.
[193:23.50]I was in there already.
[193:24.24]We just need two more things.
[193:26.98]Come on.
[193:29.30]Mana Recharge Station.
[193:31.87]Eh.
[193:37.11]There's that.
[193:39.71]We have our Golem, and now we have... Let's need one more of these.
[193:43.06]In fact, we're good to go.
[193:44.64]Let's go.
[193:52.53]I used the... It's alright.
[194:02.44]It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[194:03.30]Everything's fine.
[194:04.64]I almost just had a panic attack.
[194:08.42]In fact, this is better, because then I can... Yeah, this is fine.
[194:14.26]I didn't repair.
[194:14.77]I will, I will, I will.
[194:19.83]After I get through these dickheads up here...
[194:22.83]We gotta go slow and I gotta run in the room?
[194:25.51]No.
[194:25.81]We have to have the golem has to go in the room first.
[194:29.33]I ain't going in there first.
[194:41.19]Okay.
[194:41.73]Where is it?
[194:46.85]The shithouse has to go in there first.
[194:49.00]There they are.
[194:49.50]Alright.
[194:49.98]Get them.
[194:51.42]Get in.
[194:51.74]Everybody in.
[194:53.40]Everybody get in.
[194:56.56]Kill.
[194:57.42]Holy fuck.
[194:58.06]There's still a lot of people in there.
[195:04.46]We good?
[195:06.62]Oh my god.
[195:07.44]Oh my god.
[195:07.80]Oh my god.
[195:08.16]What do I do?
[195:08.64]What do I do?
[195:10.86]I'm fine.
[195:11.12]I'm fine.
[195:11.36]I'm fine.
[195:11.58]Kill this guy.
[195:15.33]I'm going to overwhelm them.
[195:16.29]Overwhelm.
[195:20.90]Callum's doing a good job.
[195:21.82]Nice.
[195:27.68]Everyone's fine?
[195:33.37]Alright, kill him.
[195:41.43]He is pounding him, right?
[195:42.29]This is perfect.
[195:42.79]Alright, nice job.
[195:44.17]That was almost a disaster.
[195:58.33]Almost a disaster a second time.
[196:02.25]What have we got?
[196:04.27]Almost level up.
[196:06.97]Everyone's OK?
[196:08.91]We continue.
[196:23.32]Found it.
[196:28.30]Gale level one.
[196:32.57]Safe.
[196:35.17]Okay.
[196:35.57]I'm gonna... Where's, uh... Is that really in such a stupid place that I can't click on it?
[196:45.56]Did I really do that to myself?
[196:56.18]I'm gonna go gamble, too.
[197:02.06]I'm not gonna repair.
[197:02.64]It's a lot of money.
[197:15.95]Try to get some heavy armor.
[197:16.89]Well, this chain gloves.
[197:22.63]Which are probably better than what I have.
[197:26.25]How much... It's too expensive.
[197:40.28]Couldn't be much worse.
[197:43.89]I'm alright.
[197:45.21]It's not terrible.
[197:46.75]I have more defense now.
[197:50.07]Does he know that it's not pronounced... It's pronounced dual... It's not dual-weld.
[197:54.42]Yeah, I know it's wield.
[197:56.34]Dual wield.
[197:58.24]Dual weld is easier for me to say.
[198:01.72]Dual welding.
[198:03.06]Dual welding.
[198:06.61]Dual welding.
[198:13.71]Dual wielding.
[198:14.51]I know.
[198:16.11]Alright, we're just gonna level up.
[198:17.35]I think that's good.
[198:18.82]Let's go back in.
[198:20.76]I'm prepared.
[198:24.31]Duel Weld Golem Bad.
[198:27.03]It's okay.
[198:28.73]Alright, shoot.
[198:34.30]Place your bets, actually.
[198:36.28]I want to know real opinions.
[198:37.62]Do you guys think I'm going to beat Andariel?
[198:40.48]Do you think I'm gonna?
[198:43.84]How do we figure this out?
[198:44.62]How do we do an actual figure this out test?
[199:05.01]Heavy gloves.
[199:05.45]There it is.
[199:08.61]What are you doing up there?
[199:17.34]Are you okay?
[199:19.56]Hold on.
[199:20.60]Actually, I have to pause the game.
[199:22.30]I'm going to help him.
[199:23.32]He needs a blanket.
[199:24.30]Hold on.
[199:59.22]he has this uh you got a cone we got him one of the soft cones you know things so he doesn't get his stitches so but he can kind of get stuck then when the when the cone because it's a soft cone it can press down and he's like I need to help him sometimes that was a real wink
[200:26.54]really was that was actually okay that actual yeah you're right it's it you're right here hey thanks a lot the prophecy has been fulfilled how we doing
[200:51.60]Dude, I can't wait to kill Andario the first try.
[200:55.05]I'm losing.
[200:56.69]Stay back.
[201:26.00]Too bad that's not a weapon.
[201:28.26]It's Paladin only, so... I guess I could save it.
[201:32.06]Hold on.
[201:33.76]Six.
[201:35.56]Wait.
[201:39.58]So many potions!
[201:40.40]Do they, like, up the amount of potions you can have?
[201:44.36]I swear to God, the last time I played this, there wasn't this many potions available.
[201:50.53]Don't keep kicking those.
[201:51.71]Bring... Jail level 2.
[201:53.17]Alright, easy.
[201:55.23]Easy, easy.
[201:56.03]Skill shrine.
[202:03.19]I might be able to get more skeletons with that.
[202:20.50]Does it let me do six?
[202:23.10]Four and a third.
[202:24.80]Yeah, a third.
[202:25.40]Wait point.
[202:38.91]Almost at the inner cloister.
[202:40.65]Almost at a major boss of the game.
[202:44.27]We're almost there.
[202:57.98]There are so many potions because the game is trying to drop enough of the three players you have.
[203:02.78]Jerma hacker.
[203:05.53]I guess that's true.
[203:11.58]Antidote potions.
[203:12.66]I know.
[203:13.28]I know.
[203:13.80]I've played the video game.
[203:15.50]I know Andario's got poison and you have to be careful.
[203:18.97]Because it'll kill you.
[203:21.09]I'm going to be so terrified.
[203:22.45]You guys want to know something about this?
[203:26.30]Here's a true story.
[203:28.56]I have never once and I truly mean ever over the course of thousands and thousands and thousands of hours across diablo one through diablo three thousands thousands of hours I've never played one single character on hardcore this is the first time you're ever gonna see this never taken a shower I have never ever taken a shower
[204:01.64]Hardcore to me was always too stressful because there's so many ways to die in these games.
[204:06.58]Especially when you get onto a higher difficulty, like Nightmare of Hell.
[204:09.81]You can die in one hit.
[204:11.31]Just... From something across the room.
[204:14.57]I hated it.
[204:16.77]I hated taking showers.
[204:32.03]The level of mine?
[204:32.53]14?
[204:32.69]Not bad.
[204:38.75]You guys going first.
[204:43.34]Thank God you guys selected Amplified Damage.
[204:50.43]Come on, get in there.
[204:52.89]Get in there.
[204:53.31]Papping.
[204:53.75]Let's go.
[204:59.98]What the hell are you doing?
[205:05.26]Dude, 14?
[205:06.48]What?
[205:06.82]Are you serious?
[205:08.19]Yeah.
[205:09.21]Oh, he's dead.
[205:15.49]Not anymore.
[205:19.39]Look at that ring.
[205:24.21]Am I wearing a bathing suit?
[205:29.43]Why would I be wearing a bathing suit?
[205:33.74]Spin time?
[205:45.94]Will somebody kill somebody over here, please?
[205:49.60]I can't even see who's over here.
[206:01.41]He's going to explode.
[206:02.21]I think he's going to explode, right?
[206:08.28]Do eight players or riot?
[206:11.44]No.
[206:11.58]I'm on four right now.
[206:19.99]You're at level two.
[206:20.59]Come on.
[206:24.35]No, it's not over there.
[206:25.09]It's down here.
[206:46.86]Players 99.
[206:47.70]I mean, if I do players 8, I'll level up faster, but it's too dangerous.
[206:55.73]That's way too dangerous.
[207:02.74]Level 2.
[207:04.96]This game is 20 fucking years old.
[207:08.50]Yep.
[207:08.74]It's very old.
[207:10.38]Time to get dangerous?
[207:19.37]No.
[207:19.91]No.
[207:20.71]No.
[207:22.82]I can't let it end like that.
[207:23.88]I'm going to put it on eight players and die.
[207:26.25]And then I'm going to sit there and go, why did I... What's the point of that?
[207:30.03]What, to make myself look cool?
[207:35.78]Attack rating 15.
[207:37.12]Yeah, that's better.
[207:39.70]Poison resist?
[207:41.02]I need poison resist.
[207:48.90]The good thing about this hardcore run, if this character dies, you're not going to care about losing him.
[207:54.95]Yeah, that's a pretty good way to put it.
[207:56.87]That's not a bad way to look at it.
[208:02.09]Don't put eight until after Andariel.
[208:03.86]Plus, I might get some really good items from Andariel.
[208:07.08]Hopefully.
[208:07.64]Hopefully I get at least one or two uniques.
[208:11.18]That's the real goal here.
[208:16.27]When you see that first gold text drop, it's like, I wonder what that's going to be.
[208:22.42]Alright, be careful.
[208:27.82]Watch it.
[208:29.72]Oh my fucking god, don't run in there, you idiot.
[208:33.04]Alright, stone skin demon.
[208:35.54]Amplify that damage.
[208:36.95]Stay over here.
[208:41.21]Try to get a set.
[208:43.53]Well, once I get the waypoint, I can do end aerial runs and just try to get a couple of cool items before I get killed in Act 2.
[208:51.43]Anyone still alive?
[208:54.11]Alright.
[208:58.53]Hang up on him.
[209:02.07]Come on.
[209:06.59]No.
[209:07.27]Give me something.
[209:08.99]Give me anything.
[209:09.57]It's not a leather.
[209:10.25]Hold on.
[209:14.19]no go back and sell look at all this crap they had to they did something weird with these potions somebody did they actually did patch this
[209:41.41]This is a lot.
[209:47.99]They patched it on Otto's birthday.
[209:50.04]Oh, that's nice of them.
[209:55.76]What's even in the stash?
[210:00.04]Nothing.
[210:02.68]Alright, six and six, that's fine.
[210:04.08]Alright, jail level two.
[210:08.20]Okay, what happened?
[210:09.32]I'm good.
[210:13.65]Don't know why but that I got the same reaction for that that if my character died in hardcore I don't know why I thought something happened Good
[210:39.74]I'm going to be able to level up twice here in a minute, which is probably better than pausing the game for like five, ten minutes.
[210:48.83]Hey, Vaude, Jerm is going to die soon.
[210:51.81]What's your prediction?
[210:52.71]Yeah, I mean, you've got to give your prediction after that.
[210:56.47]Right?
[210:57.07]You can't just say soon.
[210:58.23]When?
[210:58.45]Give us time.
[211:04.08]When?
[211:06.17]in 15 minutes from right now.
[211:08.37]We're 3 hours and 32 minutes into the stream, so we're 3 hours and 47 minutes.
[211:16.68]Okay.
[211:18.58]We'll see.
[211:27.97]As long as I have an army, I might be okay.
[211:36.53]He just opened the door by himself.
[211:37.91]No, you gotta let Dad open the doors.
[211:41.11]Don't open doors for no reason.
[211:48.67]I have to be in control of that.
[211:59.18]Once we get to the inner clusters, then I'm going to start to deal with it.
[212:03.40]This game is actually kind of scary.
[212:09.49]Okay, a level 3... No.
[212:12.23]What is that?
[212:12.93]Resist fire?
[212:13.61]Sure.
[212:15.49]I'll take it.
[212:18.61]That makes me take 75% less damage from fire.
[212:23.07]I think.
[212:23.86]Although I've never really known what that does.
[212:25.36]I've been promising the green screen since November.
[212:30.14]What's the holdup?
[212:30.72]For those of you that don't know, I have costochondritis.
[212:38.99]Which means I can't move around that much.
[212:41.29]And until I find a solution for that problem, I cannot jump around and fly around and do the things that I want to do in front of that green screen.
[212:51.88]I'm... I gotta... Hold on.
[212:52.52]I gotta apply damage on me.
[213:02.32]It might include a few things.
[213:03.20]I might have to have surgery on a hernia.
[213:05.22]And I might have to get an injection of steroids.
[213:07.65]That's pretty much the only way you treat it.
[213:11.95]Unfortunately.
[213:13.75]This is going to be really bad.
[213:14.87]I have to focus here.
[213:18.03]Don't kill me.
[213:19.00]Why can't you guys be fired?
[213:20.00]Okay.
[213:30.09]Alright, to the guy that said this is gonna end in 12 minutes, how dare you spawn these enemies here.
[213:35.02]Go in!
[213:36.12]Like, physically go in the door!
[213:39.09]Get in there!
[213:39.63]Somebody go in!
[213:41.35]Go inside!
[213:42.11]Alright, kill!
[213:43.43]Fight!
[213:55.98]I need a mage.
[214:00.11]I need a mage.
[214:02.37]I need a mage.
[214:15.64]Why do you get to have amplified damage too?
[214:17.30]It's not fair.
[214:28.48]Kill it!
[214:34.84]Alright, slowly but surely get in here.
[214:39.61]Ayayay.
[214:40.79]Where's my golem?
[214:52.93]I need somebody.
[214:53.77]I need somebody.
[214:54.55]I need somebody.
[215:00.20]Back up.
[215:03.02]Any corpses?
[215:06.84]No.
[215:11.55]You got to get in there, man.
[215:12.81]You got to get in there.
[215:14.29]Come with me.
[215:14.59]You got to get in here.
[215:17.81]Get in there.
[215:18.69]He's coming to us.
[215:19.31]He's coming to us.
[215:20.95]Look at his health.
[215:26.68]Inside of the gate.
[215:28.36]In the gate.
[215:30.94]Get in the gate!
[215:31.98]You're just getting hit for free.
[215:34.22]Thank you.
[215:34.68]At least somebody has a brain.
[215:49.94]What if he explodes?
[215:51.12]Alright, I'm ready with another golem.
[215:56.64]This is too scary to do this on my own.
[216:04.61]He just lowkey called them dumb.
[216:08.25]Well, yeah.
[216:10.03]He's kind of dumb.
[216:12.89]He's going to explode into cold.
[216:16.68]I know it.
[216:17.54]I'm staying all the way back here.
[216:23.84]Come on.
[216:31.30]One more.
[216:32.10]Hit him.
[216:33.71]Yep.
[216:34.09]Okay.
[216:34.57]I knew that was going to happen.
[216:39.37]Nice work, you two.
[216:40.23]You did it.
[216:46.03]Okay.
[216:48.26]I'm going to kill like two more things and level up.
[216:51.28]No corpses over here.
[216:55.17]Promote that golem to iron.
[216:59.01]I probably will.
[217:00.67]Well, actually, no, I won't because it's not my decision.
[217:06.13]Don't let me influence you.
[217:08.07]I'm going to have two levels up here.
[217:12.92]Alright, be careful.
[217:30.24]I don't want them to... Ice, they explode, and that's terrible.
[217:33.78]Because I can't turn them into corpses after that.
[217:51.87]Delete this character?
[217:52.99]You've ruined the purity of the run.
[218:02.79]level up I will I will I will I'm gonna put this down I just want to get jail level three
[218:40.33]We got everybody?
[218:41.19]Yes.
[218:44.60]Kill up here.
[218:45.98]Alright, don't even fight that.
[218:46.76]That's death.
[218:47.52]Down here.
[218:47.88]I think it might be in here.
[219:13.35]There it is.
[219:14.41]I knew it was down here.
[219:16.09]Yeah, level three.
[219:19.29]Alright.
[219:20.23]Time to level up.
[219:22.84]We got two levels up.
[219:24.30]I'm going to put ten points in.
[219:27.00]Where should we put our ten points?
[219:28.14]Time for you guys to make a good decision here.
[219:35.90]See what we got?
[219:36.84]We got ten.
[219:42.80]Where's it going?
[219:51.25]You're looking a bit low.
[219:56.00]I'm talking about coffee, Cheetos, and what?
[220:02.48]I'm actually not sure where that is being clicked.
[220:11.64]Oh.
[220:12.86]No.
[220:14.66]No, no, that's terrible.
[220:16.86]That's the worst thing I could put 10 points in right now.
[220:25.26]actually is the worst you need hit chance imagine putting one point in dexterity get influenced okay get influenced get influenced
[220:58.66]10, 9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[221:05.73]Done.
[221:09.21]Vitality, 10 points in white.
[221:13.66]Yeah, done.
[221:14.54]Look at that.
[221:20.05]39%.
[221:20.09]Thanks a lot, guys.
[221:30.45]Ah, I feel so much safer.
[221:31.57]Alright, we have two points to put in, but we have potentially some new shit to look at here.
[221:40.13]Raise Skeleton, Skeleton Mastery, make it a better Skeleton.
[221:43.90]Make Clay Golem a little better, or make it plus 20% health.
[221:52.94]Skeletal Mage is a third Skeleton, permanently.
[221:56.74]We don't have enough to go down yet.
[222:00.86]one point in teeth.
[222:01.96]It's just so... It's haunting me.
[222:07.87]Or we have, again, amplify damage.
[222:10.59]Also, keep in mind, putting a second point in amplify damage does not make it do more.
[222:17.19]It's always 100%.
[222:19.31]It just makes the radius bigger, so you don't have to cast... It gives you a huge wide area and duration.
[222:26.71]All of them.
[222:29.26]So, Iron Maiden is... I believe Iron Maiden does go up.
[222:35.25]Explosion is here.
[222:37.99]Still have not picked anything in this, really.
[222:40.15]Besides some of you just making a joke a few hours ago.
[222:44.73]And then, again, take a look at what you have available for summoning.
[222:48.31]Alright.
[222:49.33]Where do you guys want to go?
[223:12.91]Summoning, looks like.
[223:15.95]Not a bad choice.
[223:19.29]Where would you like to go inside of that?
[223:31.40]Summoning memes are so 2019.
[223:42.11]Hmm, you seem pretty set in... Well, we have another point to put in, so this is the first one.
[223:45.88]What about the second one?
[223:48.20]We'll take a look at what it looks like afterwards.
[223:49.58]Alright, here we go.
[223:50.94]Skeleton Mage.
[223:53.26]Some of you want to do a better Golem, which I don't disagree with you.
[223:58.26]Not a bad choice.
[224:00.17]But you're going to deal with the 43% of these guys.
[224:03.21]Trying to put a... Well, a third Skeleton Mage is good, too.
[224:05.29]I'm fucking into this.
[224:08.97]I'm beating Andariel first try.
[224:17.37]Alright.
[224:17.75]Alright.
[224:18.01]Alright.
[224:18.29]Alright.
[224:18.53]Alright.
[224:18.75]Okay.
[224:18.99]Okay.
[224:19.29]Okay.
[224:19.51]Okay.
[224:19.87]Alright.
[224:20.31]Alright.
[224:20.51]Let's go.
[224:25.07]Third skeleton mage.
[224:27.48]We have enough.
[224:29.18]By the way, keep in mind, this is going to make them stronger defense-wise, but it's not going to add another mage.
[224:41.06]See?
[224:41.46]Take a look.
[224:45.23]Take a look and see what it does.
[224:46.55]Make sure you're certain of what you want to do.
[224:49.68]ResidentSleeper actually making a real build.
[225:00.92]But... Are they, though?
[225:05.26]You know what I mean?
[225:11.73]I mean, it could be, kind of.
[225:15.48]Alright, you know what's available.
[225:17.56]I don't have to show you.
[225:21.83]Again, I will very much implore you to open up a Diablo II skill calculator and go to Necromancer.
[225:30.17]You can take a look on your own time, you know, so I don't have to show you this.
[225:33.99]You can be certain of what you want.
[225:36.50]No, no, no, no.
[225:37.78]Alright, Jesus.
[225:39.58]Just give me a suggestion.
[225:40.62]What the fuck?
[225:41.68]Alright, where are we going?
[225:48.54]Why would I do that?
[225:49.26]I just click on X.
[226:26.22]Oh, okay.
[226:27.80]Summoning it is.
[226:29.40]Silence.
[226:30.90]Summoning it is.
[226:31.68]What are we doing in summoning?
[226:40.10]Real build.
[226:41.02]Real build.
[226:42.82]What is this real build?
[226:43.96]I wanted to do 20 points into Dim Vision.
[226:49.32]Why?
[226:49.76]No, he's going to kill Andariel.
[226:58.88]You had an opportunity, and you didn't take it.
[227:05.73]I actually completely... I have to apologize to you guys.
[227:10.95]I was under the impression that you were going to put one point into Skeletons, and then 20 points into Skeleton Mastery.
[227:23.00]I thought you were going to do 20 points into teeth.
[227:27.33]You guys are actually working pretty well right now.
[227:31.33]Let's get all the mastery.
[227:33.69]I don't want to give you any ideas, but you're already going on a build here.
[227:41.70]Okay.
[227:45.64]All the mastery.
[227:46.11]Let's go.
[227:53.04]Which, as you see, life is at 100.
[227:56.54]This is an attack bonus.
[227:57.68]Take a look at the attack.
[227:58.42]It's at 20.
[228:00.02]So he's at 80 and 100.
[228:00.88]Let's do a bang.
[228:04.76]So he's got 120 health.
[228:08.30]The attack is a little bit better.
[228:09.78]He's just going to live a lot longer.
[228:12.14]He walks a lot faster, too.
[228:15.96]You're doing cockpit build.
[228:39.43]this is literally the build I did in middle school yeah and guess what it's fun to look at but you'll see when we get to a boss it's only me well who knows they may have patched it here we go jail level three let's do it thanks for voting
[229:08.44]You guys won't even give me bone armor.
[229:10.09]If I'm gonna be melee... Necromancer, like, you at least give me some defense.
[229:18.63]Am I running faster?
[229:29.94]Why do I feel like I'm faster?
[229:43.26]It's kind of a suboptimal build, I would say.
[229:45.62]Yeah.
[229:46.36]It's very suboptimal.
[229:49.99]But that's just the way it is.
[229:50.83]Now we get a champion down here.
[229:52.49]Nice job.
[230:22.73]Oh, that's right.
[230:23.59]You're right.
[230:23.93]I do have another mage.
[230:25.61]You're right.
[230:31.49]We got eight friends.
[230:38.06]Yeah, the Golem lasted a lot longer.
[230:42.44]Golem's name should be Clay.
[230:55.46]Well, the thing about the golems in this game is if you beef them up, they will survive at bosses and they will... It is just you watching somebody else play the game.
[231:07.35]Just hypothetical.
[231:08.13]If you guys put like 20 points into the golem shit, we're going to be watching somebody else watch somebody play a video game.
[231:21.98]I will be the camera pointing at the golem.
[231:27.28]Come on, Drew Crew.
[231:28.46]Why can't he just be dead in 10 seconds so we can play Nancy Drew?
[231:35.07]That's not even... That's not gonna happen.
[231:39.69]If I were to die in 10 seconds, we would have played Paperclip Empire.
[231:44.21]Or whatever that thing was called.
[231:59.33]Crew, crew, crew, crew, crew, crew.
[232:04.27]Look, we got a new crew.
[232:09.07]Look at this crew.
[232:09.97]You don't like this crew?
[232:26.32]Skeleton crew.
[232:29.28]Calcium crew, come on.
[232:44.62]Milk mob?
[232:50.72]Alright, here comes a battle.
[233:00.56]This gets so hectic when you don't even know who's on your team.
[233:11.36]Once there's 10 skeletons, 15 skeletons, and 5 different... It's just hard to determine what's going on.
[233:23.54]I've got an item.
[233:24.20]Did they patch like good items or what?
[233:30.67]Where are my cool items?
[233:32.98]I haven't seen one.
[233:40.22]Bones are made of solidified milk.
[233:43.06]This is where I die.
[233:44.58]Game over.
[233:44.90]This is game over.
[233:45.36]I lose.
[233:48.45]Holy fuck, that was terrifying.
[233:54.05]Get everybody in there.
[233:58.51]Bones equal frozen milk.
[234:05.35]Yeah, I gotta bind portal.
[234:06.47]If I'm playing on hardcore, I gotta bind portal to something.
[234:11.56]I'll just stand there and open up the inventory.
[234:14.04]Alright, that's a lesson I need to learn right now.
[234:17.39]Alright, I'm binding F5 to town portal.
[234:24.91]Okay, good to know.
[234:33.96]That was so stressful.
[234:35.24]When they all run at you like that.
[234:37.04]Did I say that Adam Sandler got snubbed for best actor?
[234:41.06]I did.
[234:41.46]It's a joke.
[234:44.96]Oh, it's not bad.
[235:08.82]I'm actually getting a little nervous.
[235:11.27]I just heard the blacksmith's voice line and got nervous.
[235:16.93]What did he say?
[235:19.69]He said, I will crush your bones to dust.
[235:23.03]Something like that.
[235:23.63]But I'm scared now.
[235:26.05]I will grind up your bones.
[235:34.67]Don't open...
[235:41.20]What a room.
[235:42.00]Bad room.
[235:44.25]Are we doing everybody alive?
[235:48.27]Don't get stuck in there.
[235:48.97]Don't get stuck in there.
[235:49.49]I don't want to die.
[235:54.51]Come on.
[235:58.07]Stay alive.
[235:59.86]I'm just a coach.
[236:05.94]I'm just a football coach.
[236:19.08]Diamond, I'll take.
[236:22.40]Teleporter?
[236:23.50]Old and enchanted.
[236:25.18]Are you seriously going to give me paladin shields?
[236:33.89]Why?
[236:34.15]Give me anything else.
[236:36.03]This sucks.
[236:45.20]That sucks.
[236:45.64]It's okay.
[236:51.61]It's alright.
[236:56.37]Diablo II, Paladin's chapter.
[236:59.61]I was just paraphrasing.
[237:05.56]That wasn't actually me actually doing it.
[237:06.82]It was me paraphrasing it.
[237:08.20]Found it!
[237:08.56]Alright, inner cloister.
[237:11.30]Time to get scared.
[237:20.55]Almost another level, that's right.
[237:22.17]I'm so glad I'm not a potion find barbarian.
[237:28.43]This would not have lasted very long.
[237:29.69]This would have been horrible.
[237:36.52]It might be going a little faster if I was source first or something, but even still, I think that would be horrible as well.
[237:53.98]This is just stupid and shitty enough to last long enough to have fun.
[238:00.94]But thanks for that.
[238:03.57]It's because you are one.
[238:10.13]I am one.
[238:10.57]What?
[238:16.97]Alright, this is kind of funny.
[238:22.88]This is kind of funny.
[238:23.94]I'm gonna put this on screen.
[238:44.95]That's funny.
[238:52.48]This stream was worth it just for that.
[238:54.12]Oh, whatever.
[238:57.24]I just want to do this.
[238:58.00]I think this is fun.
[239:07.64]+2 to the artist.
[239:11.18]Alright, here we go.
[239:13.22]Where's the waypoint?
[239:13.90]It's like right here somewhere, isn't it?
[239:23.69]+2 to the art is -2 to me.
[239:26.89]I didn't say anything.
[239:27.99]Can't you just give us two to the art?
[239:29.09]What?
[239:29.51]I didn't... You didn't do it to the art.
[239:32.46]Why do I have to get a minus?
[239:36.34]That seems kind of unfair.
[239:40.24]Inner cloister, there it is.
[239:41.52]Alright, time to get scared.
[239:43.68]Seriously.
[239:44.42]Actually scared because this is the part where the... Monastery barracks.
[239:51.23]Coming up here.
[239:57.77]I have a lot of friends.
[239:58.77]It's over here.
[240:10.53]Is there no max level?
[240:13.93]Uh, there is no max level.
[240:15.71]Wait, is it outer cloister?
[240:16.73]Wait, where is it?
[240:17.94]I didn't know.
[240:22.02]It's outer cloister, isn't it?
[240:23.02]Yeah, it's the barracks.
[240:28.84]Okay.
[240:32.87]Well, I'm going to do this because I want the... I want to be able to do the thing.
[240:36.31]Time for you to die.
[240:46.19]Barracks, okay.
[240:47.91]Yeah, I was in here before.
[240:48.77]Alright.
[240:55.86]I hate this.
[240:56.90]I hate hardcore.
[240:58.24]I do.
[241:00.38]Any one of these doors, I'm just going to hear the voice line.
[241:03.94]It's going to scare the shit out of me.
[241:05.66]He's going to sprint at me.
[241:06.38]He's going to hit me once.
[241:07.76]Curtis, Curtis.
[241:12.18]Kill him.
[241:22.06]I'm trying to get around.
[241:25.52]Alright, golem, tank him.
[241:29.42]Still alive, right?
[241:36.92]Good, kill him.
[241:40.24]Okay.
[241:47.32]I am so paranoid.
[241:50.25]Roger this.
[241:52.18]We bring this back to, uh, Charcy.
[241:56.20]This is actually pretty good.
[241:57.06]Alright, bring it back to Charcy, and then we can imbue any weapon in the game.
[242:05.43]As long as it's white.
[242:07.85]We can make it magic.
[242:10.61]Good to see you.
[242:11.81]Oh, thanks so much for returning the Horadric Malice.
[242:15.42]I will now imbue one of your items with magical powers.
[242:19.04]Thank you.
[242:19.52]So the idea here is you do not just do this for no reason.
[242:25.58]You find something that's really high quality, and you bring it.
[242:30.21]So you don't just want to throw one.
[242:31.51]Oh, yeah, a random pair of socks.
[242:33.69]No, no, that would be terrible.
[242:34.71]That would be a waste.
[242:36.77]Almost level up.
[242:39.24]Yep, yep, yep.
[242:39.92]Kill Andariel.
[242:40.46]Find Andariel's lair in the depths of the monastery catacombs.
[242:44.18]We are there.
[242:44.48]I'm ready.
[242:45.04]I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.
[242:47.12]Let's go.
[243:08.21]I'm ready.
[243:10.85]We need to get the Catacombs level 2 waypoint so I can farm for items if I want to.
[243:17.25]Do not ever, under any circumstances, play Diablo II and not get the last waypoint.
[243:22.81]It would be a mistake.
[243:23.99]Don't do it.
[243:26.10]I know some of you just want to run through, but you have to get that waypoint.
[243:29.08]Otherwise, this is great.
[243:43.88]Worst mistake of my entire life.
[243:46.60]Oh my god, he's... I would be so scared if I was doing this with anything else.
[243:58.48]Oh, there's a lot of people in here.
[244:00.74]Slow, slow.
[244:01.44]Good thing I was... We got our first... Boys and girls, we got our first unique.
[244:07.33]And a jewel.
[244:09.19]Oh yes, don't die.
[244:11.53]That's a unique over there.
[244:12.81]Uniques in this game are not like Diablo 3.
[244:14.45]They're actually cool.
[244:16.50]It's not just like 700 strength, 700 intelligence, 750 health.
[244:22.40]No.
[244:22.94]They're actually cool.
[244:32.94]What is it?
[244:33.26]I don't... Oh my god.
[244:35.32]Our first fucking legendary!
[244:39.91]I want to identify him right now, but that's a mistake.
[244:46.66]700 IQ glove.
[244:49.14]Player of the room, don't be an idiot.
[244:51.30]Don't be a fucking idiot.
[244:53.02]No reason to put myself in danger.
[244:54.86]Alright, who's reviving?
[245:00.44]Where are you?
[245:00.86]Where's the shaman?
[245:01.40]Where's the shaman?
[245:10.98]Okay, that's a champion.
[245:14.53]Woman.
[245:20.23]Spectral hit.
[245:33.92]Thank you, Coke Gaming.
[245:37.58]It's so funny how that just became a thing randomly overnight.
[245:43.78]It really did.
[245:44.50]Alright, let's see.
[245:46.36]Heavy Gloves.
[245:51.60]Pretty fucking good.
[245:52.90]Blood Fist.
[245:53.53]10% increased attack speed.
[245:57.16]40 health, 10 defense, plus 5 to minimum damage.
[246:04.91]Let's see what this does when I put him on.
[246:07.31]Look at the health.
[246:13.42]Ready?
[246:15.72]150.
[246:15.86]190.
[246:16.02]30% faster hit recovery, which is huge.
[246:21.70]40 health is huge.
[246:24.35]Yep.
[246:26.39]Nice.
[246:33.31]seems kind of bad um for a for a random just normal act one it's pretty good shaking my head bullshit gloves let's go to the catacombs
[247:01.75]You're not going to beat Act 2.
[247:05.13]Well, there's a way I'll beat Act 2.
[247:09.19]And that is... I know it's going to be me versus Durial.
[247:14.62]Right?
[247:16.18]So, I just have to grind until I have, like, 80 cold resistance.
[247:20.50]That's just the only way.
[247:25.82]What about the maggot lair?
[247:26.96]Oh, man.
[247:27.80]I forgot about the maggot lair.
[247:30.06]That might be the run ender.
[247:33.52]Alright, catacombs.
[247:36.07]It sucks.
[247:40.35]It's a really shitty jewel.
[247:48.27]Like, you're gonna make it to the maggot lair?
[247:52.72]I think I'll make it to the maggot lair.
[247:54.62]I mean, unless something really bad happens now.
[247:56.84]And we're gonna find...
[248:02.35]Am I screaming tomorrow?
[248:03.57]Yeah.
[248:05.05]Another jewel.
[248:06.31]Durial is going to kill 100%.
[248:08.71]I don't know.
[248:09.41]This is going to be tough.
[248:11.45]This is better than what I have on.
[248:33.35]9 to 15, 1 to 27, but... I'm out of, I'm out of, um, town portals.
[248:45.70]That's horrible.
[248:51.26]I have, okay, I can't go back to town.
[248:55.33]Shouldn't I be paying attention to that stuff?
[248:59.00]Don't go drop one.
[249:11.95]Ay-yi-yi.
[249:15.79]Stay back.
[249:16.31]Don't do anything dumb.
[249:21.87]So identify, that's not what I wanted.
[249:23.35]Whatever it means, they're going to drop.
[249:36.03]Come on, scroll.
[249:37.35]Scroll the town portal.
[249:38.51]You can't be a rat, man.
[249:43.21]Hold on.
[250:05.21]Are you alive?
[250:15.20]I am overburdened.
[250:16.02]How am I overburdened?
[250:17.06]Oh.
[250:17.22]Alright, is this better?
[250:20.10]If I put... Alright.
[250:21.70]If I just put a bunch of dumb shit in here.
[250:24.40]3 to 4 fire damage.
[250:25.30]Can I make this better?
[250:26.00]15, 16 to 18.
[250:27.48]No.
[250:44.02]Fire resist and cast.
[250:48.00]No.
[250:49.62]Doesn't Daryl have fire?
[250:51.80]No, it's poison.
[250:52.50]Is it poison and fire?
[250:54.20]It might be.
[250:56.16]Town portal, there it is.
[251:03.52]Yes, poison?
[251:04.12]OK.
[251:06.78]Greetings.
[251:16.33]It sells junk.
[251:18.91]Junk, junk, junk, junk, junk.
[251:21.77]This shit is junk, too.
[251:23.79]Yeah, it's taking up too much space.
[251:24.97]Get the hell out of here.
[251:26.93]It really is taking up too much space.
[251:30.55]This guy's a psycho?
[251:33.51]What did I do?
[251:41.27]Psycho.
[251:47.35]14,000.
[251:47.37]Should I gamble?
[251:48.99]Maybe.
[251:51.71]Okay, we'll level up.
[252:00.21]I'm going to need to do it every time.
[252:19.22]I need... I'm looking for... I need armor.
[252:22.56]Alright, what's the worst thing I possibly... What's the worst thing I have on me?
[252:25.78]These boots suck.
[252:27.46]Level 3.
[252:29.78]This belt sucks.
[252:33.72]Everything kind of sucks.
[252:35.22]The boots are probably the worst, though.
[252:39.70]I don't need gloves anymore for a while.
[252:58.90]Mmmmm... Claymore?
[253:04.27]Boots.
[253:08.61]Boots, Geed.
[253:09.43]Come on.
[253:13.71]Better belt.
[253:14.57]Gonna be another slot.
[253:15.55]Where are the boots?
[253:17.41]Anything.
[253:19.35]Geed, come on.
[253:22.43]Here we go.
[253:24.33]Heavy boots.
[253:29.07]Fuck.
[253:38.78]This is still awful.
[253:40.26]Why level four of all the things?
[253:46.56]I'm so focused on this game, you won't notice.
[253:48.16]Ah, yes, I do.
[253:57.46]Alright, chain boots.
[254:02.26]Bad.
[254:02.54]I can do this, like, one more time.
[254:06.10]I don't want to completely broke.
[254:13.58]Alright, chain boots.
[254:14.14]Come on, rare.
[254:30.08]Well, that didn't work out.
[254:31.72]Here are the points at this point.
[254:34.37]Where am I putting these stats?
[254:43.54]Take a look.
[254:45.24]Okay, here we go.
[254:57.76]What does dexterity do?
[254:58.78]It makes you hit more.
[255:01.06]It increases your attack rating.
[255:03.71]And technically your defense.
[255:05.43]But it makes it so you hit more.
[255:06.99]Your hit percent chance goes up.
[255:12.69]Did you die and restart?
[255:13.87]Why are your stats so bad?
[255:18.17]That's not a question for me.
[255:26.08]Okay, we're doing dexterity.
[255:37.44]See, defense... Average chance that Dark Shaman will hit you, 40%.
[255:42.02]When this goes up again, it's not going to go up again, is it?
[255:46.71]90.
[255:48.93]Still at 40%.
[255:49.21]Not bad.
[255:51.85]Only 27 mana.
[255:53.05]I have 80 mana, but I've... It's chance you're hit and chance to hit things.
[255:58.89]Alright.
[255:59.13]Alright.
[256:06.70]We are, uh, when's the next level of, uh... 18 is when we get more stuff.
[256:13.85]So at 18, Blood Golem will make an appearance.
[256:16.47]We can do Skeleton Mastery, which will... Skeleton Life damage.
[256:25.38]Improve Missile damage.
[256:26.46]It essentially just makes everybody better.
[256:30.32]Uh... More health on Golem.
[256:37.51]Pack bonus gets to 40%.
[256:39.13]Health goes up by a lot, because this is synergizing, obviously, with Mastery.
[256:51.15]uh not quite have not enough to do another mage and not another melee potentially though maybe make the skeletons better we put a point anywhere here absorbs 20 damage as you see that's pretty useful but you haven't put one point in it yet so like thanks or a curse and you've seen this already before
[257:23.15]Imvision, Iron Maiden.
[257:32.81]Choose wisely the category you'd like to point into.
[257:51.22]Ugh.
[257:56.02]Poison Dagger is the meta.
[258:03.20]It's not your choice, it's your choice collectively.
[258:11.91]He wants bad choices to make it more interesting.
[258:14.35]How does giving me a shield that absorbs a bunch of health, a bunch of damage, me trying to meme you guys?
[258:20.21]I'm trying to live.
[258:22.67]I want to see the end of Act 1.
[258:26.29]Alright, summoning.
[258:33.52]Which skill?
[258:50.38]No, we're not choosing categories anymore.
[258:57.98]If he dies in Act 1, we get a 10 minute mountain stream.
[259:00.34]Yes.
[259:01.36]That is still on the table.
[259:10.05]Skeleton Mastery.
[259:15.87]Okay.
[259:25.22]to be with the level three which will increase the life 24 prove missile damage yeah I mean okay let's see six to seven and there doesn't say how much damage they do but six to seven with health at 168 so let's see eight to ten now and 76 health better defense they're just better all around
[260:00.19]I have... I have what I need, right?
[260:06.29]I just want to say, you betrayed the Dru crew.
[260:09.30]I'm going to be honest.
[260:16.32]Well, we're... We're milk mob now.
[260:22.05]Sorry.
[260:35.92]I do feel a little stronger.
[260:38.10]Sick.
[260:41.65]Sick.
[260:43.41]I think they're a little stronger.
[260:44.35]Sick.
[260:45.99]Sick.
[260:51.39]Level two.
[260:52.73]I got everybody, right?
[260:56.29]So fucking mad.
[260:56.95]I'm so fucking mad.
[260:57.73]I'm so fucking mad.
[260:58.53]I'm so fucking mad.
[260:59.25]I'm so fucking mad.
[261:04.73]Oh, I don't know what to tell you.
[261:07.03]Besides, Drew Crew has their time.
[261:11.81]And they continue to have time.
[261:14.01]But it's not just only about Drew Crew.
[261:16.27]It's about other crews making an appearance, being able to have fun.
[261:29.77]Watch out for that explosion.
[261:30.59]It's going to happen.
[261:35.85]Kill it.
[261:37.35]Ooh.
[261:37.87]Ooh.
[261:41.25]Crystal sword.
[261:47.02]Come on.
[261:49.00]Alright.
[261:50.29]That's better.
[261:50.95]Seven to 24.
[261:51.27]One to two...
[262:05.88]Take a look at that.
[262:08.87]Alright.
[262:09.77]I get corpse explosion now.
[262:13.07]At least temporarily.
[262:14.27]20 to 44 damage.
[262:18.37]I'm good with that.
[262:35.61]And... Let's get Corpse Explosion on... I don't know.
[262:39.53]Let's say... No, not Q. I gotta redo this bar.
[262:47.16]I'm gonna get... F1 is gonna be Skeleton.
[262:50.00]No, no, no.
[262:50.72]F1 is... No.
[262:54.80]Hmm.
[262:56.43]F1, Amplify.
[262:57.03]F2, Corpse Explosion.
[262:59.99]F3, Weaken.
[263:01.11]No.
[263:02.03]No.
[263:03.29]yeah and then f4 f5 f6 so these are my offense moves and then here my yeah so f4 f5 f6 I can also scroll too but it kind of is hard to do miss things very easily alright now I have corpus explosion so I can do this
[263:33.77]This just became possible to beat this.
[263:36.91]As long as I never take this weapon off.
[263:39.55]Find portal again.
[263:40.41]Shit, you're right.
[263:54.88]Okay.
[263:55.54]Uh, F7.
[263:57.76]Please, Jerma.
[263:58.50]Please, Mokka S. Find your portal, Mokka S.
[264:11.55]Level 2, where is it?
[264:12.37]I feel like I'm missing somebody, am I?
[264:14.71]No.
[264:19.73]Dude, there have been exactly 5200 people here for the last hour.
[264:28.43]That's kind of crazy.
[264:33.35]Jerk!
[264:36.27]That's a dagger.
[264:47.23]Yep, but I can't do corpse explosion that much because I don't want to lose bodies For summoning It's tricky
[265:06.50]Not up in the top right corner.
[265:08.28]I mean, it's probably going to be lower left.
[265:14.45]That's where I think it is.
[265:19.29]Easy.
[265:21.61]I like the sword.
[265:27.45]It adds to my attack rating pretty well.
[265:36.87]Nice try.
[265:38.23]Almost.
[265:44.03]Do not let me leave here without the waypoint.
[265:48.29]Did you see me go down?
[265:50.33]No, I have to get the waypoint.
[265:52.51]Or else it's a waste of time.
[265:59.27]Corpse explosion is a broken skill.
[266:01.69]Yes, it is.
[266:03.98]Yes.
[266:08.70]Nice volume.
[266:18.46]Fact.
[266:20.72]It is pretty good.
[266:22.93]Can you turn up my volume please?
[266:29.87]Yeah, sorry about that.
[266:31.99]I'll be over in five minutes.
[266:34.59]I know you don't want to get out of bed.
[266:38.06]You want anything else?
[267:01.71]I never seen this build on forums before.
[267:08.47]Look at that.
[267:13.09]Look at how good it is.
[267:17.84]Don't overuse it.
[267:19.00]Unlimited power.
[267:30.14]Unlimited power!
[267:32.54]Who says that?
[267:37.87]I know who says it.
[267:38.81]I just wanna know if you know who says that.
[267:58.38]If my game were to crash right now, would it... It's not like I lagged and I died, right?
[268:10.77]It would just save and exit the game where I am?
[268:14.65]I think so.
[268:29.28]Not bad.
[268:31.14]Not bad.
[268:35.09]I'm gonna close this out before I pick build, man.
[268:42.11]Stop.
[268:45.65]Stop teasing me.
[268:48.83]Come on, waypoint.
[269:02.19]Don't waste it.
[269:03.35]Shit is trapped everywhere, too.
[269:31.17]How long have I been streaming now?
[269:32.13]Like four hours?
[269:32.79]Four and a half hours?
[269:35.22]Something like that.
[269:42.77]Come on, waypoint.
[269:53.46]Bro, please fucking clear Act 1 already.
[269:57.01]I knew somebody was going to say that.
[269:59.11]I knew it.
[269:59.87]When I said, oh, you know, four and a half hours.
[270:02.19]I was waiting for the four and a half hours.
[270:03.89]You still haven't killed one Daryl.
[270:06.78]Come on.
[270:07.22]Look at me.
[270:07.94]Get with the program.
[270:09.10]Look at me.
[270:23.10]Dude, get through Act 1 already.
[270:25.34]What the fuck, man?
[270:28.76]You're really starting to piss me off.
[270:31.24]I'm sorry.
[270:45.89]I am a good level, though. 16?
[270:52.71]16?
[270:52.75]You really want to be somewhere around level 20 for accuracy.
[270:58.46]Like 15 to 20 is what you want to be.
[271:02.26]Usually.
[271:08.26]Careful.
[271:11.09]I hate these spiders.
[271:12.49]Alright, I'm going to kill this motherfucker down here.
[271:36.79]I'm just trying to get a feel for it.
[271:47.00]Where is this waypoint?
[271:50.50]What, are you going to do Diablo 3?
[271:55.63]Ow.
[272:01.01]No, I don't want to play D3.
[272:03.59]Careful.
[272:09.25]Three SOJs in chat.
[272:16.46]Stones of Jordan were... It really was crazy how that was just the currency of the game.
[272:26.54]I told you guys that I got scammed out of a pre-patch worm skull before, right?
[272:30.22]I don't want to- alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[272:41.71]I got scammed.
[272:50.05]Yeah, it's because... I don't know, I was an idiot.
[272:54.85]Is he dead?
[272:55.53]How strong is this thing?
[273:03.08]Is Diablo II worth paying $20 for?
[273:06.66]Well, he missed the first part of the stream.
[273:09.82]Instead of a lot of bad things.
[273:12.11]Level up.
[273:19.67]We cannot kill this.
[273:30.27]Kill that thing right there.
[273:31.65]The thing's lightning enchanted.
[273:32.59]I will die if I go in here.
[273:36.59]Kill it.
[273:36.93]Come on.
[273:37.23]I know you can.
[273:38.25]Get a couple more people in there.
[273:39.07]Get in there.
[273:41.60]Alright, easy.
[273:42.18]Can't cast.
[273:49.60]Here we go.
[273:53.34]I can't go in here.
[273:54.22]Oh, it's too bad if I do.
[274:07.88]You're in such a shitty spot.
[274:10.18]Come out of that spot.
[274:12.08]No, don't just go in.
[274:12.86]What are you, dumb?
[274:18.25]There's no corpses?
[274:19.35]I'll be back.
[274:21.51]No.
[274:21.89]Stay there.
[274:22.25]Stay there.
[274:23.19]How much health does he have?
[274:26.21]He's got too much health.
[274:27.03]Alright.
[274:27.43]We have to kill some stuff.
[274:28.29]Let's run.
[274:34.36]Oh.
[274:35.40]I found it.
[274:36.04]But I can't leave.
[274:47.19]I'm so useless without the army.
[274:48.91]Oh, there he is.
[274:51.99]He's already got his health back.
[274:57.23]Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me.
[274:58.25]He regens?
[274:58.79]How am I going to kill this?
[275:06.71]Shoot teeth at him?
[275:08.29]No.
[275:09.15]That's the best bet I do.
[275:18.31]I'm gonna go in there and just smash him.
[275:19.53]Let's wait it out.
[275:29.42]Look, he's regenerating faster than I can kill him.
[275:31.56]He's regenerating faster than I can kill him.
[275:34.54]Should I pull out the teeth?
[275:35.78]I'm going teeth.
[275:36.32]Let's do it.
[275:54.50]Not ideal.
[275:55.52]Not ideal.
[276:01.01]I have to... How much am I lightning at?
[276:03.29]Ten.
[276:03.75]No.
[276:04.21]It's dead.
[276:05.11]I'm going to die.
[276:06.99]What do I do?
[276:07.35]Did I hit him once?
[276:10.27]No.
[276:10.55]That's death.
[276:11.72]See, look.
[276:12.24]One little of those bolts.
[276:13.38]No, no, no.
[276:14.10]This is hardcore, guys.
[276:14.88]You can't make a stupid mistake like that.
[276:17.36]He's going to follow us around, but that's fine.
[276:18.50]I'm going to get an army.
[276:28.43]No bodies anywhere?
[276:29.23]No bodies.
[276:31.01]We have to find one.
[276:38.91]There.
[276:42.70]You can't wait to see this boomer's gonna get owned.
[276:46.04]That's what you think.
[276:47.64]But it's probably not gonna happen.
[276:49.68]I'm gonna be very careful.
[276:51.78]I know how dangerous this is.
[276:53.32]I'm gonna be very, very, very careful.
[276:58.06]Okay.
[276:58.60]On the waypoint.
[277:00.72]Good.
[277:02.48]We're fine.
[277:04.02]I need to kill this fucking spider.
[277:15.69]Good.
[277:16.13]Okay, wasted it.
[277:16.75]Alright, this is enough.
[277:19.61]This is enough.
[277:20.03]Let's go.
[277:20.60]Come on, boys.
[277:29.04]Where you at?
[277:33.84]Where you at?
[277:34.18]You're hanging out over here somewhere.
[277:40.00]Where is he?
[277:40.38]In here?
[277:42.62]Get him!
[277:46.82]Get him!
[277:47.92]Get him!
[278:07.64]God damn it.
[278:09.98]Come on.
[278:11.88]He's melting.
[278:13.84]My golem.
[278:15.18]Every time.
[278:17.10]Kill.
[278:17.58]Holy shit.
[278:18.08]I thought the game crashed.
[278:18.80]Now it's about to fucking scream.
[278:20.69]Don't let him run.
[278:21.23]Kill him.
[278:24.45]He's almost dead.
[278:26.77]Alright.
[278:32.95]Good.
[278:33.29]Well, that wasn't worth it.
[278:34.83]Oh, well.
[278:38.92]Give me a skeleton.
[278:40.58]How many times does this Jerm says, Get him!
[278:48.27]This stream?
[278:49.55]Oh, probably a lot.
[278:51.39]Get him.
[278:52.65]Get him, guys.
[278:54.59]Get him.
[278:55.69]Get him.
[278:56.73]Get him.
[278:57.47]Yeah.
[278:57.63]Alright, let's get lucky and find level 4 immediately and then fight the major boss of the video game.
[279:07.59]I need more.
[279:08.07]Easy, easy.
[279:09.11]Don't just go on running in.
[279:12.09]This is bad.
[279:13.91]This is bad.
[279:14.65]Get him.
[279:15.32]This is bad.
[279:15.96]Get him.
[279:17.54]Get him, guys.
[279:18.16]This is bad.
[279:18.88]Get him.
[279:26.62]I don't feel safe without a full crew.
[279:29.16]And why would I?
[279:29.70]It's the only thing this points at.
[279:42.58]God damn it.
[279:43.68]How about over here?
[279:44.42]Top left?
[279:52.95]Get him and resurrect him.
[279:56.59]There we go.
[279:58.63]Perfect.
[280:02.13]Stop shattering them.
[280:03.35]I need these guys alive.
[280:12.38]Because one of these magicians has the freeze.
[280:16.86]Kill it.
[280:17.16]Don't... Blow it up.
[280:18.42]Good.
[280:18.66]Why did I just... I'm an idiot.
[280:22.27]Alright, now I need two more mages.
[280:29.81]Undead, extra strong.
[280:30.97]That means we did it once.
[280:33.61]We're in trouble.
[280:43.63]Kill it!
[280:43.95]Get it!
[280:44.97]Kill it!
[280:45.81]Get it!
[280:46.75]Kill it!
[280:47.33]Full team.
[280:48.17]Alright, I'm back to being confident again.
[280:51.37]I feel good.
[281:13.63]There's like a zit on my face that's coming up.
[281:15.89]Where did that come from?
[281:17.73]You know when your face is normal and then 10 minutes later there's just a zit on your face?
[281:22.04]Why does that happen?
[281:29.98]I hate that.
[281:38.87]Nothing in here.
[281:39.71]Oh, where is level 4?
[281:44.47]That's stress?
[281:47.65]Yeah, probably.
[281:53.89]Superior studded leather.
[281:54.95]We can turn that into something if I really want to.
[281:57.91]Do I want to?
[281:59.01]I don't know.
[282:00.15]Should I view that?
[282:01.27]No?
[282:05.95]You don't think so?
[282:07.55]I know I can come back here and do it.
[282:11.88]They don't have to fight anything Oh, I can get that to Kyle
[282:55.01]Okay, longbow.
[282:55.81]Lots of money.
[282:58.50]We need one more.
[282:59.98]I don't like how they're dying.
[283:01.14]They're dying to regular enemies, which I don't like.
[283:03.70]I really don't like that at all.
[283:14.48]Level up.
[283:15.00]Re.
[283:15.94]I will.
[283:16.22]Before we fight Andariel, don't worry.
[283:17.46]I just want to get there first.
[283:24.71]I'm so sorry, I just punched you in the face.
[283:29.48]Oh, let's go up this way.
[283:32.96]Level up, reee!
[283:34.16]Level up, reee!
[283:36.48]These guys suck.
[283:48.79]Come on, where is it?
[283:55.08]Diamond?
[283:55.46]Ooh.
[283:57.46]Chest, chest, chest.
[284:00.60]I've explored the entire left side and you're telling me it's not over here?
[284:06.02]What did I say?
[284:06.62]Blizzard sucks.
[284:10.81]The first like 30 minutes of this stream is just anger.
[284:29.96]It's true, though.
[284:33.74]I think Coolsville sucks.
[284:39.79]Please, I just want to do it.
[284:41.17]It's taken me five hours to kill Endariel.
[284:44.45]Come on.
[284:44.95]I can't have it cross five hours.
[284:48.03]I know we've spent like 40 minutes picking abilities.
[284:56.49]Come on, it's right here.
[284:58.82]And then we're going to make a safe point.
[285:00.00]Everyone's alive.
[285:08.17]There it is.
[285:09.79]Catacombs level four.
[285:11.61]Kill Andariel.
[285:15.05]Oh, I just clicked that.
[285:17.72]Thank God.
[285:18.92]Okay, easy.
[285:25.50]Tricky room.
[285:26.66]Tricky room.
[285:28.14]Tricky room.
[285:28.58]I'm scared.
[285:30.88]I hate hardcore.
[285:31.74]I don't like hardcore.
[285:32.62]It's too stressful.
[285:43.52]You OK?
[285:52.03]I got to go in here with a full team.
[285:57.58]Get him.
[285:59.14]Hold enchanted.
[285:59.74]I gotta run up before he does anything.
[286:01.49]Get out!
[286:01.71]Get out!
[286:01.93]Get out!
[286:02.13]Get out!
[286:07.09]I can't carry anymore.
[286:08.37]How?
[286:09.19]What?
[286:10.31]Oh, right.
[286:14.33]Alright.
[286:14.79]Go back to... Go back to town.
[286:17.14]Okay, we're gonna get the archer.
[286:21.72]Give her the bow.
[286:24.26]Greetings.
[286:24.98]Hold on.
[286:25.48]Isn't she like level 3?
[286:29.48]Well, that was a stupid thing to do.
[286:30.70]You're gonna die instantly.
[286:33.89]Level 7.
[286:41.15]You haven't been leveling Kyle.
[286:45.67]No, because why would I?
[286:50.94]I want the Act 3 companion.
[286:54.86]I'm gonna... Should I imbue this?
[286:55.98]It's hardcore.
[286:56.60]It's hardcore.
[286:58.17]You know what I'm saying?
[286:58.91]It's hardcore.
[287:00.53]I gotta take the opportunity.
[287:01.59]Superior studded leather.
[287:02.55]Just imbue it and make it a rare.
[287:05.27]I can't just hold on to it.
[287:06.27]What if I die?
[287:09.89]Save it?
[287:10.29]There's better armor at Tarsi.
[287:14.34]Is there?
[287:16.34]But then you loser.
[287:18.16]Jesus Christ.
[287:25.26]Okay.
[287:25.46]Okay.
[287:28.80]Right, get rid of the dirk.
[287:42.52]If he dies, he dies.
[287:43.92]Yep.
[287:44.22]Let's all build it up to this moment.
[287:50.46]I need antidote potions.
[288:00.67]how much are they they're expensive it might be overkill but it's not trust me
[288:38.01]Okay.
[288:46.90]We're gonna be such a coward.
[288:49.78]What am I doing?
[288:50.44]A stack when you drink.
[288:53.26]What are you talking about?
[288:56.82]You really don't need to do this.
[288:58.04]Yes, I do.
[289:03.17]Yes, I do.
[289:06.90]If I get poisoned, I'm gonna die.
[289:09.24]So I have to instantly just take it off.
[289:14.20]And I'm gonna make the portal in a place where I can just run the fuck away.
[289:23.46]You can't die from poison?
[289:24.56]No, but I can die from a swing to my head!
[289:26.66]That's a coward strat.
[289:29.55]This is hardcore, man.
[289:31.21]Alright, gamble.
[289:45.51]This is hardcore and I'm alone.
[289:54.16]I have my pretend friends here.
[290:08.21]You don't have to be.
[290:11.21]No, I mean, for today I do because I was shadow banned from Battle.net.
[290:17.43]And I have to make a new account and buy the game again.
[290:23.10]We went over this.
[290:25.02]Alright, so... No, I'm not going to buy this from Charcy.
[290:36.18]You can't rely on multiplayer.
[290:37.66]No, I can't.
[290:40.87]I gotta accomplish it.
[290:42.35]Gotta achieve it on my own.
[290:48.01]Got a leather.
[290:48.47]Come on.
[290:49.65]Let's see it.
[290:50.01]Ooh.
[290:54.75]Ooh!
[290:55.75]Oh.
[290:59.56]Ooh.
[291:19.57]Come on.
[291:20.11]Alright, what am I putting points into?
[291:28.66]That's what we got so far.
[291:32.78]50 vitality, 48 strength, 32 dexterity, 36 energy.
[291:51.07]How do you get banned for a 20-year-old game?
[291:55.73]Oh, no.
[292:05.13]Did he die once?
[292:06.03]If I die once, the character's gone.
[292:13.04]Did you use map hacks?
[292:14.28]No.
[292:17.50]The only thing I've ever used was...
[292:20.53]The glide wrapper.
[292:23.29]Is that illegal?
[292:24.93]I don't know.
[292:25.29]What are we doing, though?
[292:34.71]Wait, it is?
[292:37.59]Wait, the glide wrapper is illegal.
[292:40.09]And that's why I got banned.
[292:43.61]It's just to make it so you can see the 3D shit.
[292:48.51]No, is that... Are you for real?
[292:56.18]I don't believe that for a second.
[292:57.44]Alright, we're doing vitality.
[293:12.69]All the glide wrapper does is just make it so you can actually see the effects and the 3D stuff and everything, right?
[293:18.35]I don't know.
[293:28.34]That was so disappointing when I saw that though.
[293:30.06]Alright, let's do a skill.
[293:30.98]Let's take a look.
[293:32.98]Again, here we are.
[293:36.16]So you can see.
[293:39.88]These are fake.
[293:42.14]Just to make sure you understand.
[293:43.40]They're fake.
[293:49.62]Next level we open up some stuff down here.
[293:54.58]Now it looks like we can... I don't know.
[293:57.48]It's up to you.
[293:59.53]Poison Dagger.
[294:00.17]Bone Armor.
[294:02.58]We still have Iron Maiden.
[294:05.72]Weaken.
[294:09.00]Up to you.
[294:16.32]Pick the category.
[294:23.55]Hold on.
[294:24.23]It screwed up.
[294:28.64]Blizzard fucking sucks.
[294:34.43]Alright, you know when you say something and you know you're like, I probably just don't say it, eh, who cares.
[294:40.49]Me angrily saying Blizzard sucks four hours ago is like, eh, oh well.
[294:46.05]Whatever.
[294:46.35]Oh well.
[294:49.35]Oh well.
[294:55.46]Oh well there.
[295:00.85]Top 40 streamer without sponsors.
[295:04.53]I don't think I'm going to get invited to the next Overwatch mixer.
[295:09.43]Oh.
[295:11.05]Uh oh.
[295:26.44]Okay.
[295:27.84]Poison and Bone.
[295:32.35]Cool.
[295:33.11]Um, what do you want?
[295:35.75]Pick something good.
[295:36.51]Why would you pick teeth right now?
[295:47.58]Why would you pick teeth right now?
[295:48.84]Are you trying to fucking kill me?
[295:51.20]Yes, but don't answer that.
[295:58.16]Yeah, you're giving me bone armor.
[296:00.06]Good.
[296:00.24]Good.
[296:02.60]That's just 20 extra health.
[296:04.62]Permanently.
[296:07.82]Nice job.
[296:11.28]Thank you.
[296:12.76]Thank you so much, guys.
[296:19.67]I'm going to show you some of the other category stuff down here, just so people that don't know what the hell's going on, they can make a more informed decision.
[296:27.30]So, bone armor receives plus 15 absorption from bone wall and bone prison.
[296:35.65]Here's bone wall.
[296:37.28]Bone wall just makes a gigantic, annoying wall of bone.
[296:43.20]It's a way to block stuff off.
[296:50.69]One and one.
[296:52.19]And then bone prison can hold anything.
[296:54.05]Creates a barrier of fossilized bone around your target.
[296:57.17]So it just traps them.
[297:07.77]Okay.
[297:10.27]Bone wall is great in the maggot lair.
[297:13.69]It can help a lot.
[297:17.38]But watch.
[297:17.72]Look at how cool this is.
[297:21.40]now that that just stays on forever until it comes off I'm gonna make it f8 alright no more fucking around no more dicking around let's see if I can kill the first boss in the game look what you guys have presented alright
[297:52.05]Get rid of the runes beforehand.
[297:53.29]Get rid of the shamans.
[298:14.18]Look at that bone armor.
[298:14.90]It's just helping so much.
[298:15.86]I feel safe.
[298:19.58]Okay.
[298:23.70]Alright.
[298:24.08]Let's go.
[298:24.92]Not yet.
[298:25.34]Not yet.
[298:25.64]No.
[298:25.76]Hold on.
[298:25.94]I want to make sure I've ever... I want to make sure I've ever full health.
[298:29.30]We good?
[298:29.70]Okay.
[298:32.69]I think we're good.
[298:33.97]Here we go.
[298:34.51]I'm actually kind of nervous.
[298:35.81]I've never done this before.
[298:41.65]Do you remember when you poured a two liter in your friend's humidifier?
[298:49.06]What the fuck are you talking about?
[298:50.70]I didn't do that.
[298:56.98]Interesting though, I wonder what... In a humidifier?
[299:03.65]A two liter of what?
[299:06.35]Sprite?
[299:07.57]What would happen if you did that?
[299:11.59]That's so stupid.
[299:17.61]I just took damage because of that.
[299:19.31]Alright, let's go.
[299:20.01]Here we go.
[299:24.29]On Dariel.
[299:24.83]No more... No more sitting around.
[299:26.30]Let's go.
[299:26.64]Everybody in.
[299:34.30]There's Shaman.
[299:43.10]We haven't killed her yet, that's good.
[299:47.38]Any more shamans over this way?
[299:49.67]Kill that shaman right there.
[299:51.05]Oh god.
[299:53.67]Kyle's dead.
[299:59.61]Everybody's dead.
[300:00.41]Everybody's dead.
[300:01.55]Everybody's dead.
[300:02.05]Everybody's dead.
[300:02.53]Run.
[300:03.95]Run, run, run, run, run.
[300:05.27]Back to town.
[300:17.08]You didn't even use an antidote?
[300:18.24]No, man.
[300:18.72]I don't want to get killed.
[300:19.66]I don't want to take one punch and die.
[300:24.03]I need... Okay, we need corpses.
[300:26.13]Everybody stand still.
[300:31.25]Stay, stay, stay.
[300:32.29]Okay.
[300:35.17]Okay.
[300:45.27]Where is she?
[300:48.61]Alright, everybody get up.
[300:49.83]Pull it, pull it, pull it, pull her in here.
[300:51.53]Alright, get her, get her!
[301:08.99]What's going on?
[301:18.08]She instantly killed everybody.
[301:20.61]Get me out of here.
[301:21.87]Get me out of here.
[301:27.93]Get me out of here.
[301:30.77]Okay, I'm fine.
[301:32.51]Let's refill the potions.
[301:35.68]Alright, somebody just wrote... Pathetic.
[301:45.06]Hey...
[301:48.99]Fuck.
[301:49.53]It's alright.
[301:50.09]It's okay.
[301:51.07]Alright.
[301:51.41]Alright.
[301:51.73]Alright.
[301:52.07]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[301:53.96]We're not doing that.
[301:55.52]I'm going in with a full army.
[301:56.66]I'm not going to get killed.
[301:59.98]Let's just go to the Darkwood and just get people.
[302:03.66]I'm not going in with just my clay buddy.
[302:07.25]That would be absolute death.
[302:10.77]Just do not use a town portal under any circumstances.
[302:25.10]I need bodies.
[302:30.10]It's just me and you.
[302:31.63]I can't wait to see what items we get.
[302:33.93]I'm so excited.
[302:35.77]But nervous at the same time.
[302:36.93]Let's go get blood vials.
[302:40.21]Ooh, stamina shrine.
[302:46.48]Doesn't matter.
[302:49.36]You guys just kill.
[302:50.24]I'm not going to hit anything.
[302:50.86]I don't want to break it.
[302:55.06]Don't use a town portal.
[302:55.90]You're being idiots.
[303:02.07]Same deal.
[303:02.45]Then I'm going to swarm her.
[303:03.35]I'm going to go for it again.
[303:07.55]Alright, let's go.
[303:11.63]Follow me.
[303:16.05]We got the crew back.
[303:22.59]You ate a bunch of Oreos and threw up in your mother's bed.
[303:24.41]I drank a bunch of... I drank a bunch and puked in a friend's bed with brothers.
[303:31.51]I don't think that's the same story.
[303:37.76]I don't think those two things are connected.
[303:40.70]Alright, give me some mana potions.
[303:43.92]No, I don't need them.
[303:45.50]Alright, good.
[303:47.56]Alright, here we go.
[303:50.61]back in.
[303:51.31]I still have town portals.
[303:53.03]Oh, fucking god damn it!
[303:55.18]Why?
[304:01.32]It's so... Alright, here we go.
[304:03.28]One, two, three.
[304:08.00]Get in.
[304:26.08]Get out!
[304:32.15]Okay, wait.
[304:33.01]She's almost dead.
[304:33.89]She's almost dead.
[304:34.65]She's almost dead.
[304:35.36]I'm fine.
[304:36.12]I don't... Am I?
[304:38.86]I've never done this before.
[304:39.92]I don't know what I have to say...
[304:52.36]Ah!
[304:52.48]He's hit me, he's hit me.
[304:57.44]Yeah!
[305:24.84]back to the hell that spawned you and dario I did it wait kane will do this for free
[305:39.52]This is a great victory indeed.
[305:42.26]Loot the chamber?
[305:42.91]Yeah, I will.
[305:43.31]Many more battles await.
[305:45.51]I will accompany you on your journey.
[305:47.91]Finally.
[305:48.23]Lending what assistance I can.
[305:50.79]Remember, Diablo is still out there, seeking something in the desert.
[305:58.52]On your way to loot Golane.
[306:00.42]And Daryl's death brings about renewed life for us all.
[306:04.60]Yes.
[306:06.72]Now we talk to, uh, Wariv?
[306:08.95]Not yet.
[306:12.68]Finally, we may rejoice.
[306:14.92]We owe you a debt we can never repay.
[306:17.88]I only hope that in time, we will be able to rebuild our order.
[306:21.68]Skipping quests.
[306:30.69]He must just be watching a video.
[306:34.57]What can I do for you?
[306:35.55]Alright, let's get these identified and see if there's anything worth using.
[306:40.27]Good to see you.
[306:46.07]6 to 23, no.
[306:47.33]Sorcerer's Only, no.
[306:48.04]9 to 22, no.
[306:55.82]No.
[306:56.62]Sell it all.
[307:01.14]Got a regular ruby.
[307:08.05]That's pretty good.
[307:15.71]All that shitty items.
[307:17.76]Well... Uh... Not necessarily.
[307:24.02]Because... I mean, I guess I could, uh... I might just do it again.
[307:35.80]I might just kill Undario again.
[307:41.82]What you need?
[307:57.06]At least you get a normal ruby.
[307:58.70]That actually will come in handy.
[308:00.50]If I get a weapon with a socket, that's just 20 plus extra damage.
[308:05.27]That's pretty great, actually.
[308:11.39]Oh, come on.
[308:13.47]Is that better?
[308:13.91]No.
[308:14.39]Alright, let's go to Act 2.
[308:20.72]Oh, hey, you want to watch a cutscene?
[308:36.13]I didn't lose the chamber.
[308:38.51]We traveled east, over the mountains and into the vast deserts of broken lands.
[308:46.92]As the days passed, my companion told me of himself, that he had once been a great warrior, and that a dark and secret burden now weighed heavily upon him.
[309:04.32]we traveled for an eternity across that arid wasteland how long I couldn't say and always a dark cloud seemed to follow us just yeah finally the journey ended we climbed the last bridge there below us lay our destination
[309:33.21]The shining jewel of Root Lane, with a great sea beyond.
[309:43.84]We made camp there last night.
[309:46.14]It looks like Kenshi.
[309:47.74]Perhaps it was the warm desert wind or the sound of the ocean, but for the first time in many weeks, I slept.
[309:57.52]However, the dreams return, but these were clearly not my own.
[310:03.25]I beheld the vision of a great man, the mage Tarasha.
[310:08.23]You were there too, Tyrael.
[310:10.49]I remember seeing you in my dream.
[310:13.95]His brethren had courted a great demon.
[310:17.23]Baal, Lord of Destruction, had been set loose upon the world.
[310:23.63]They attempted to imprison the demon within a sacred stone.
[310:31.68]Yet when their attempts failed, Tal Rasha selflessly volunteered to contain the demon within himself, completing the prison.
[310:44.00]He instructed his brethren to bind him within a tomb buried under the sand there to wrestle with the demon for all eternity.
[310:57.41]How long is this?
[311:00.53]This is pretty long.
[311:02.77]I'm not even sure why we're watching this.
[311:05.75]Now you know what I seek, Marius.
[311:08.90]This is my brother.
[311:11.59]Sleep now.
[311:12.93]We set out with the dawn.
[311:20.53]The next morning, we walked over the hill toward Lut Gullain.
[311:26.65]I had no idea then of the horrors that were in store for me there.
[311:38.19]Welcome to Lut Goleyn.
[311:39.59]Greetings, honored traveler.
[311:41.37]I am Jaren, Lord of Lut Goleyn, and I bid you welcome to my fair port city.
[311:47.02]I'm glad to know that once again, caravans are free to travel through the Western Pass.
[311:51.93]For some time now we have been under siege by an evil power that I cannot identify.
[311:58.50]Strange, it all began when a dark wanderer came this way, looking for the tomb of Tal Rasha.
[312:05.08]No one knows exactly where Tal Rasha, keeper of Baal, is entombed, but it is certain to be far off in the desert.
[312:12.76]Now my people whisper tales of the Dead Rising from their tombs, and horrible creatures lurking amongst the moonlit dunes.
[312:21.15]Even I have witnessed things which I cannot explain.
[312:25.23]Okay.
[312:30.53]It's you raising the dead.
[312:33.26]How do I know I can trust you?
[312:34.30]Better potions now.
[312:51.63]I'm running out of money.
[312:52.29]This skeleton needs to calm the fuck down.
[312:57.12]He's fine.
[312:57.32]He's just... Look, he just had a bath, okay?
[312:58.94]That's why he's doing this.
[313:18.04]Alright, so the first thing you do here is, is obviously you gotta make the townspeople of Lutgo Lane trust you.
[313:26.64]You gotta clear out the sewers.
[313:27.82]Only noobs do every quest?
[313:29.32]Alright, the portal is still there.
[313:30.46]That's right, I can just, I can go loot still.
[313:49.91]Okay, do the sewers.
[313:50.49]The sewers actually can kind of suck.
[313:52.89]Enemies are not easy.
[313:57.01]Yeah, let's just go.
[313:57.65]Let's go loot the chamber.
[313:59.41]Yeah, it's still here.
[314:10.96]Ah, we can still do it.
[314:11.82]Alright, let's go to the back.
[314:39.80]I can't do that until the elbow's dead, right?
[314:42.05]Or is that only after I have one?
[314:44.81]I don't remember.
[314:45.89]It's been so long.
[314:47.49]Just do the cowliver?
[314:48.33]Can I do it?
[314:49.03]Can I?
[314:49.65]No, I can't do it yet.
[315:10.80]Yeah, he's still bailed.
[315:11.78]Yeah.
[315:11.98]Alright, was there anything back here?
[315:16.58]Nothing was even back here.
[315:19.86]But I did get companions, though.
[315:25.10]You have so much gold.
[315:26.04]Yeah, I don't mind having that much gold on me, because... It's not if I... Oh, if I die, I'm gonna lose it.
[315:33.00]No.
[315:33.78]I'll be fine.
[315:34.20]Yeah, we're good.
[315:40.95]Please pick up the gold, I beg you.
[315:42.83]I just did.
[315:48.61]Okay.
[315:50.22]Let us do the sewers.
[315:53.22]Remember, say bail.
[315:55.48]Bail.
[315:59.69]Uh, where's Atva?
[316:04.96]They're being attacked and harassed by enemies underneath the sewers.
[316:10.18]And it's your job to take care of them.
[316:13.08]There's the guy to gamble with.
[316:18.73]How much money do I have?
[316:19.65]I don't have that much money at all.
[316:20.81]Okay.
[316:37.28]Watch me just die here.
[316:50.27]Easy.
[316:50.71]Don't get too cocky.
[316:51.79]How's my fire resistance?
[317:01.74]Not very good.
[317:03.70]Not very good.
[317:07.50]Did we just get two raids coming at the same exact time?
[317:14.02]Wait, what?
[317:17.86]A double raid?
[317:19.70]Was this intentional or is this unintentional?
[317:24.51]Boxbox came in with a huge raid and so did XFSN Saber.
[317:32.41]That's pretty crazy.
[317:36.66]Welcome, guys.
[317:38.10]Hope both of you had a good stream.
[317:44.07]He's on slow mode, follower only.
[317:46.45]Oh, well, that's not good.
[317:47.47]Alright, turn it off.
[317:55.03]Back of demons.
[317:57.11]If you're wondering what you're doing, why are you playing Diablo II?
[318:00.69]It's 2020.
[318:00.89]What are you doing?
[318:02.39]And it's vanilla Diablo II.
[318:03.47]I don't know.
[318:03.95]I just felt like doing it.
[318:06.01]This is hardcore.
[318:08.08]And Chad is picking every stat and skill.
[318:11.06]And they picked the clats too.
[318:12.98]So blame them for the 48 strength and 32 dex I have.
[318:19.64]But welcome.
[318:20.06]Thanks, guys.
[318:23.85]They're free.
[318:24.53]Push them back.
[318:25.92]What do you mean no we aren't?
[318:26.86]I could have just died right there.
[318:30.72]You almost just killed me guys.
[318:32.96]You almost just fucking killed me.
[318:36.90]Alright, that's a lot of arrows.
[318:38.16]I actually... That's a lot of enemies and a lot of arrows.
[318:43.71]I don't think this is going to last very much longer.
[318:45.63]I'll be completely honest.
[318:59.08]Hey, I'm new here.
[318:59.58]What kind of streamer are you?
[319:01.38]No, you know, I like to dabble in fucking all kinds of fun, fun stuff, you know.
[319:06.16]Nintendo.
[319:09.26]Big Mega Man fan.
[319:11.30]I just love Mega Man.
[319:13.56]Wait, how many people are alive?
[319:32.38]I have to pay attention.
[319:35.29]Why is it so loud?
[319:36.43]Is it still that loud?
[319:38.39]Even after turning down to almost a zero?
[319:45.10]After all this?
[320:13.01]Turn up my voice.
[320:14.93]Like that.
[320:15.27]Is that better?
[320:16.51]Can you hear me now?
[320:19.26]Hello?
[320:19.62]Hi?
[320:20.14]How are you?
[320:25.66]Yes!
[320:27.84]Now I'm too loud.
[320:29.40]What is this?
[320:37.02]A thousand times better than what I have on right now.
[320:46.58]Yeah.
[320:47.96]We get a skill point for this too, by the way.
[320:51.99]I can't believe I'm fucking swinging at people with a weapon.
[320:59.63]I still can't believe I'm doing this.
[321:08.87]Where is everybody?
[321:09.45]Get over here.
[321:21.97]Where is everybody?
[321:22.95]Are you body blocked?
[321:23.95]Get over here.
[321:27.23]Look for level two.
[321:46.37]Oh no, I can hear the game.
[321:47.85]Where do I go?
[322:01.12]Down here?
[322:01.46]Forgot about the bone armor.
[322:13.62]Well, look at how I'm so spread out with skills.
[322:17.18]Yes, I forgot about the bone armor.
[322:19.98]There's a point in teeth, guys.
[322:22.38]I forgot.
[322:23.12]I'm sorry.
[322:40.42]Just wait till we get the cube.
[322:50.54]I think we're doing alright.
[322:51.26]Let's go.
[323:05.97]I forgot my name was Tommy Lee Bones.
[323:16.96]Who came up with that?
[323:28.64]He's got X aura enchanted.
[323:29.64]Get away from him.
[323:32.60]Does he explode?
[323:49.70]No.
[323:50.70]I always think people explode, but you have to.
[323:52.93]You have to be so careful.
[324:02.27]This is a stalemate.
[324:03.35]This is a stalemate.
[324:06.80]That's better.
[324:11.26]I can't hurt anybody.
[324:12.34]I can't hurt anything.
[324:17.72]This is where it all collapses.
[324:24.32]They're starting to win.
[324:42.32]Any healing potions, too?
[324:43.74]Goddammit.
[324:50.10]Yeah, we can level up.
[324:56.57]Where'd your potions go?
[324:58.13]I've been using them.
[325:04.23]Alright, stat points.
[325:04.91]What do you think?
[325:12.93]Here's your look.
[325:15.29]Go ahead.
[325:27.68]You need another tooth.
[325:30.74]No, one is fine.
[325:33.98]One tooth is fine.
[325:38.72]Pretty split.
[325:43.13]Strength, vitality.
[325:58.56]Guys, energy is useless.
[326:01.58]Well, that's sort of accurate in a way.
[326:04.34]Alright, close it in 10 seconds.
[326:14.15]Alright.
[326:14.47]So.
[326:18.76]We're getting indecisive.
[326:25.26]What is going on?
[326:26.85]What the fuck is going on?
[326:30.11]Why is this so fucked up again?
[326:45.62]It's fixed.
[326:53.53]Sorry, I'm clicking a million times a second.
[327:00.67]Use a straw pole?
[327:01.43]Yeah, but I have to make a new straw pole for every new stat point.
[327:04.21]Alright, that's good.
[327:14.89]Vitality.
[327:22.43]That's a lot of vitality.
[327:25.19]In fact, that might be too much.
[327:26.17]I don't know.
[327:27.21]Alright, let's take a look at where we've unlocked some new things.
[327:34.34]We've got a bone wall.
[327:36.20]Bone armor still.
[327:37.20]We're in the bone category here.
[327:41.36]Keep in mind, if I put one point into this, it's going to make this increase by plus 15 absorption.
[327:46.64]Just letting you know.
[327:48.84]Just letting.
[327:49.60]I'm going to put it out there in case anybody was curious.
[327:55.37]You cannot have more than one golem out at a time.
[327:57.69]Keep that in mind.
[327:59.36]This is Blood Golem.
[328:01.48]It's a golem that shares with you the life it steals and damage it receives.
[328:06.36]Right.
[328:07.32]Okay.
[328:09.12]So, this is... We share health.
[328:12.44]And... I forgot.
[328:15.10]I forgot about this one.
[328:28.52]It converts 86% damage to life.
[328:32.24]And we also share damage.
[328:33.62]So that's a thing.
[328:39.56]In the curse category, we can't even go down past Iron Maiden.
[328:45.35]You can do lifesteal.
[328:51.69]And of course, we still have points into mastery and free skeleton and
[328:57.04]Whatever it is you guys want to do.
[329:02.50]Pick a category, please.
[329:09.33]You didn't... You don't mention the teeth.
[329:12.81]No, I said don't do teeth.
[329:19.13]Well, hold on a minute here.
[329:19.93]Just because you guys pick it doesn't mean I have to use it.
[329:23.95]You understand that, right?
[329:26.98]If you guys select Blood Golem, I don't have to summon him.
[329:31.37]What do I mean wrong?
[329:32.89]You guys could put 20 points into Blood Golem and I won't summon him once.
[329:42.92]No, but we can waste 20 levels in it.
[329:47.38]Okay, well, here we go.
[329:48.64]Summoning.
[329:50.42]What am I doing?
[330:03.95]Why would I use Blood Golem on Hardcore?
[330:11.37]You want to see what it does?
[330:12.11]Because we want to get to Fire Golem.
[330:19.01]Yeah, alright.
[330:29.76]Alright.
[330:30.22]Let me show you guys the other Golems, too.
[330:35.42]So, Blood Golem.
[330:38.25]Iron Golem.
[330:40.21]Transforms a metallic item into a golem that gains the properties of the item.
[330:44.47]And it also has thorns.
[330:48.91]So you have to throw an item on the ground.
[330:51.99]And then at the very bottom is Fire Golem.
[330:54.93]Creates a golem that converts the damage it receives from fire into life.
[330:59.39]And it's just a beast.
[331:01.39]You can only have one golem out at a time.
[331:07.24]Grief people's drops with Iron Golem.
[331:10.72]Well, that's if you are a sicko.
[331:18.43]So, uh... Blood Golem gives life to every Golem.
[331:24.47]As you see.
[331:27.30]Play Golem is attack rating.
[331:28.92]Fire Golem is damage to every single one.
[331:31.48]But you picked Blood Golem, so I'm gonna do it.
[331:37.63]He does look actually pretty cool, though.
[331:39.41]Let's see what he looks like.
[331:40.13]Gross.
[331:56.93]He just doesn't have any skin.
[331:57.95]Pizza Golem.
[332:03.68]Spaghetti... Spaghetti sauce gold.
[332:07.31]Alright, let's move.
[332:09.25]I didn't go that far, did I?
[332:37.73]Go get him.
[332:43.01]Can I heal him somehow?
[332:50.01]I need more.
[333:01.94]I'm taking it pretty well.
[333:03.96]I'm still getting my ass kicked, though.
[333:15.43]When's he gonna die already?
[333:16.65]I don't know.
[333:21.06]I might be okay for a little while.
[333:36.10]Alright, everyone's here.
[333:40.22]This was supposed to be a disaster stream.
[333:43.25]But here we are.
[333:44.09]Gotta rune.
[333:49.05]You didn't think I was going to do... Okay.
[333:51.41]Well, to be fair, you guys did pick.
[333:56.13]Not... Pick 20 points into Dim Vision.
[334:00.80]We went over this.
[334:04.09]Yes, yes, yes.
[334:04.77]Get emotionally invested.
[334:07.88]Wait, is this so you can just pull the rug from underneath me?
[334:12.22]Alright, no town portals.
[334:13.72]That's great.
[334:14.84]Good job.
[334:17.02]Could have made him play assassin.
[334:18.28]Yeah, I didn't say it in the beginning of the stream, but I hate assassin.
[334:23.78]I'm so bad with assassin.
[334:25.28]I don't like the movesets.
[334:26.48]I hate it.
[334:27.20]I'm so glad you guys didn't pick assassin.
[334:29.20]I would have died in the bloodmourne.
[334:38.90]Yeah, I gotta get the Act 2 Mercenary.
[334:40.34]Alright, everybody stop in there.
[334:52.81]Stop in the hallway.
[334:56.79]He's picking up minor plots.
[335:01.55]Stop.
[335:03.17]I know.
[335:03.51]I pick up everything.
[335:08.38]Oh, he's dead.
[335:19.40]Get in there.
[335:27.55]Oh, I got clay.
[335:28.31]Clay's back.
[335:28.77]Oh, right, right, right.
[335:30.95]Because it's not.
[335:32.19]I'm going to change to blood.
[335:36.35]You used Blood Golem one time.
[335:37.67]No, he's back.
[335:38.13]He's back, see?
[335:38.55]We got a full team.
[335:53.18]Taking a minor potion.
[335:56.00]Now you got in my head.
[336:03.63]I feel like this is going to start to move a little more smoothly though.
[336:05.49]Because we're not... I think you guys have an idea of what you're doing.
[336:09.15]And what you want to do.
[336:10.29]I think we might start rolling here.
[336:26.16]Almost to the boss.
[336:28.04]This boss sucks if I remember.
[336:30.91]He just resurrects everybody over and over again.
[336:32.83]And there's like a hundred people in the room.
[336:43.88]Once you see the quest marker pop up, that's when you have to freak out and make a portal.
[337:04.27]spam skeleton yeah make it so you can't do anything those are the plays and then do I get a streamer's choice skill point no fine like really come on no
[337:36.65]Alright, fine.
[337:52.10]You can't have that as your title, then.
[337:53.52]Yeah, yeah, you're right.
[337:56.96]You're right.
[337:57.30]Fine.
[337:59.04]Fine.
[338:12.30]You can do it for a wink.
[338:14.84]Combat trying, I do more damage.
[338:21.46]Is that morning star any good?
[338:30.11]Hmm?
[338:31.53]Nope.
[338:33.51]Get rid of this too.
[338:34.23]Fucking drop it on the ground.
[338:35.37]Who cares?
[338:38.27]Where is this guy?
[338:47.27]Show... Show... My skill point.
[338:53.48]I know I can just pick it, right?
[338:55.12]I mean, it'll break every rule, but I can do it.
[339:04.71]They're still alive, yeah?
[339:10.67]Oh, my God.
[339:10.89]It has to be down here.
[339:11.71]There's no other options.
[339:17.04]It's always the worst thing in these games when you look at every single possible avenue and it's the one tiny little spot that you didn't go down.
[339:25.01]Right here.
[339:25.39]This little sliver.
[339:28.05]These shit don't die.
[339:37.82]Wink?
[339:39.46]Did a wink come through?
[339:40.22]No.
[339:48.59]Alright, I need to... It's not even it.
[339:53.11]Where is the right place?
[339:57.02]Top left?
[340:01.90]No.
[340:03.70]What the fuck?
[340:14.21]Lower left?
[340:14.73]I think it's the only place that's not...
[340:18.54]I think it's down here.
[340:21.04]Am I correct?
[340:25.96]Uh, yep.
[340:27.80]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[340:29.46]Hold on, wait, I can't, I don't want to die.
[341:11.43]Apologize what?
[341:12.42]I didn't do anything There we go weaken see how much of an area that is Ow
[341:42.33]Alright.
[341:58.17]Get him.
[342:15.20]he's got a lot of health book of skill and scale mail here we come I love that sound
[342:40.43]That's pretty good.
[342:44.11]17 health.
[342:47.09]2 mana after each kill.
[342:49.41]Free skill point.
[342:55.64]Hey, that strength is coming in handy somehow.
[343:02.82]I might just put life in it.
[343:05.56]Oh, I can't leave.
[343:10.97]Haradric scroll.
[343:11.79]This tells you where the cube is.
[343:17.53]The Haradric cube.
[343:18.73]Get that socketed sword.
[343:22.89]Superior crystal.
[343:23.99]Ooh.
[343:28.05]Ooh.
[343:28.99]7 to 24.
[343:29.27]5 to 15.
[343:31.77]Eh.
[343:32.90]Wait, hold on.
[343:33.86]Let's go examine this.
[343:46.37]Imbue it?
[343:48.93]What level is it?
[343:52.01]43, 5 to 15.
[343:54.03]If I imbue it, it's probably just going to turn into this.
[343:56.21]I can't imbue it.
[343:56.98]You can only imbue white items, right?
[344:09.70]Here we go.
[344:11.60]Wait until hell to imbue anything?
[344:18.71]You think I'm gonna make it to hell with this character?
[344:22.33]You're putting a lot of faith in me.
[344:27.17]You couldn't do it?
[344:28.27]Gotta get there first.
[344:29.87]Hmm.
[344:55.70]Yep.
[344:56.16]Get the shaft.
[344:56.86]Get the head.
[344:57.40]Get the cube.
[345:00.39]Played the game before.
[345:01.35]Uh, his name's not Dylan.
[345:06.35]Alright.
[345:07.21]Here's where we get weird.
[345:08.93]Because should I... Should I... I could add 8 to 12 fire damage in this.
[345:18.68]That's kind of good.
[345:20.58]That makes it better than this.
[345:24.02]And I could add 5 to 8.
[345:30.29]This could be like 30 or 40 damage.
[345:34.77]It's fire damage, man.
[345:38.69]Save it for a better weapon.
[345:39.63]Yeah, but these gems just suck anyways.
[345:51.90]I'm going to get the cube and I can start making stuff.
[345:53.80]Yeah, that's true.
[345:54.50]Hold on.
[345:54.84]Let's organize this.
[346:26.40]Alright, that's better.
[346:28.46]Stop moving the gems.
[346:29.68]What?
[346:30.06]What?
[346:31.06]It's not by color, it's by quantity.
[346:33.88]Quantity.
[346:38.52]Outward, red is fire, yellow is lightning, blue is cold, white is undead, green is poison, and purple is attack rating.
[346:50.48]And then there's lifesteal.
[346:52.66]Which is good.
[346:53.68]Very good.
[346:56.16]And then you have these ruins.
[346:57.40]You can make ruin words.
[347:00.92]Very, very, very powerful.
[347:01.94]But we're not going to do that now.
[347:05.07]Or potentially ever.
[347:11.33]Need potions.
[347:20.88]And, give me, max out the scrolls.
[347:22.74]I want 20.
[347:23.44]Just do 20 and 20.
[347:24.16]Yeah, I know Cain does it all, but I want to be able to do it on the fly.
[347:30.14]Alright, so now... We return to Atma for rewards.
[347:36.40]Makes it so it's less expensive to do everything.
[347:38.28]And, gee, and here, where is she?
[347:42.51]Where is Atma?
[347:42.99]Down here?
[347:47.43]Yep.
[347:49.17]Quest completed.
[347:54.13]Now we have to go... This is kind of a painful part of the game.
[348:03.22]Because you have to go run around the giant wasteland.
[348:11.64]the rocky waste.
[348:14.16]You have to run around and it can be really kind of a pain in the ass.
[348:22.39]And all the bugs have electricity.
[348:29.23]So already painful.
[348:42.63]Oh, we just have to move.
[348:43.41]We're going to walk around.
[348:46.47]Get a mercenary.
[348:47.97]I will.
[348:48.29]I'm going to come back to town.
[348:49.53]We're going to have two points.
[348:52.11]All of Act 2 sucked.
[348:54.61]Oh, I mean... Act 4 is probably my favorite Act.
[349:01.35]Act 4 and Act 5 are awesome.
[349:02.63]Just because Act 4 is such a mess.
[349:04.41]It's just hundreds of enemies.
[349:12.26]It's just a giant open world with a ton of enemies.
[349:16.80]People are dying.
[349:23.06]I would say Act 3 is worse than Act 2.
[349:24.36]For me.
[349:38.33]Hold Enchanted Run.
[349:45.39]There it is.
[349:45.73]Level up.
[349:48.31]Really want to be somewhere around 20 here.
[349:49.69]20 to 25.
[349:50.41]Is it dead?
[349:57.92]Kill it.
[350:00.96]Another rune.
[350:04.58]What is an Eldrune doing?
[350:05.28]76% damage to undead.
[350:11.29]I mean, you could have an undead killing weapon if you have a six slot weapon.
[350:15.00]That'd be pretty cool.
[350:15.60]I almost just did these out of just habit, and people almost just freaked out.
[350:19.18]Alright.
[350:20.82]We've got two skill points to put in.
[350:23.84]Well, you can take a look at what we have.
[350:26.12]And to refresh your memory.
[350:34.06]You want to just see it again?
[350:35.28]You kind of know how this all works at this point.
[350:40.83]Bonewall.
[350:44.62]Poison Dagger.
[350:45.72]Heath.
[350:46.46]Bone Armor.
[350:51.40]I don't really care about curses in this chat, I don't think.
[350:53.77]Okay.
[351:03.51]Let's pick something.
[351:06.84]Pick a category.
[351:24.75]Not very clear at the moment.
[351:27.45]Okay, it is.
[351:35.00]Okay.
[351:38.32]Done deal.
[351:46.59]What skill?
[351:56.56]Fun not found.
[351:58.41]Fun not found.
[352:06.77]Do bone wall.
[352:07.71]Well, convince your fellow chatters to select bone wall.
[352:10.70]You got to do that.
[352:11.98]Another point is going into Blood Golem.
[352:29.79]Okay.
[352:31.01]Please pick a category for the second skill point.
[352:34.13]Okay.
[352:58.27]Some of you want curses.
[352:59.61]I feel bad for you guys.
[353:01.17]Because I don't think you're ever going to get what you want.
[353:04.45]I'm not sure you guys are ever going to get what you want.
[353:09.28]Poison and bone.
[353:10.00]I think I know where you're going.
[353:17.96]I'd be wrong though.
[353:32.78]We want teeth.
[353:33.94]We want teeth.
[353:36.78]I've actually tried to make teeth work before.
[353:38.94]You can kind of make it work.
[353:43.08]It's really stupid, though.
[353:47.13]Alright, bone ball.
[353:47.73]Did we do stats yet?
[353:53.65]We did not.
[353:54.09]Alright, so we got...
[354:00.39]Bonewall and Blood Golem 2.
[354:05.20]Alright.
[354:10.76]Wanna see what Bonewall looks like?
[354:17.79]Kinda cool looking.
[354:36.12]Jesus Please be unique Skeletons are dying guys.
[354:57.76]Skeletons are not lasting very long
[355:03.01]I repeat.
[355:04.39]Skeletons are not lasting very long.
[355:06.60]I repeat.
[355:14.41]Skeletons...
[355:19.51]I told you we need to buff them, you danguses.
[355:23.45]I'm just... I'm just gonna put it out there.
[355:26.27]If you're gonna have skeletons, the game is getting progressively more health, more damage on enemies.
[355:31.31]You can't just go spend it where... You can't just blow it on bone walls.
[355:39.40]Alright, let's do the stats.
[355:51.24]Who does he think he is?
[355:54.64]Jelani.
[356:12.87]Strength.
[356:14.49]Or energy.
[356:18.51]Or vitality.
[356:22.61]Bad influencer.
[356:23.59]He's a bad influencer.
[356:25.37]He's a bad influencer.
[356:27.56]Alright, strength.
[356:29.16]Thanks for ruining the game.
[356:29.92]Again, appreciate it.
[356:45.98]Look at all these abilities.
[356:47.98]It's just all over the place.
[356:50.25]I have to redo this.
[356:51.11]I'm never going to do weaken.
[356:52.47]Amplify damage is always going to be done.
[356:53.95]Okay.
[356:55.61]F1 is bone armor.
[356:57.29]F2, amplify.
[356:59.27]F3, bone wall.
[357:00.77]F4, blood golem.
[357:02.66]F5, skeleton.
[357:03.90]F6, skeletal mage.
[357:05.88]That's a little bit better.
[357:06.92]Okay.
[357:08.18]Let's go.
[357:20.82]Alright, where we at?
[357:23.94]We're gonna be in the far hills with cube.
[357:25.64]I want the cube so I can mess with the, um, recipes.
[357:28.58]It's a lot of fun.
[357:37.62]Can you wink at me in person?
[357:46.38]That just doesn't...
[357:49.42]Alright, the marshmallow wall does not do very much here.
[357:51.62]I don't even know why I'm going to... Why would I use that?
[358:03.87]Alright, it's cube hunting time.
[358:17.83]I got to get it.
[358:19.91]Where would I go?
[358:20.95]Alright.
[358:21.51]Rocky Waste?
[358:22.19]We need the far hills, right?
[358:25.35]Falls of the Dead.
[358:26.90]Under the dry hills.
[358:28.68]Okay.
[358:29.10]Up this way.
[358:29.52]He's gonna move.
[358:43.23]Don't run into people.
[358:48.81]Cast to cast right?
[358:49.99]No.
[358:50.13]Keep that on.
[358:54.65]Actually, I probably should use Bonewall here.
[358:57.74]Oh!
[359:09.57]Dry Hills.
[359:10.43]Come on.
[359:12.15]There it is.
[359:22.05]Wait, mage?
[359:24.31]Low on mage.
[359:24.75]Should have got the cast right.
[359:31.24]I'm summoning necromancer though.
[359:32.98]I'm not going to need it.
[359:44.85]Wait.
[359:46.51]I'm dying.
[359:52.62]last I need them to be strong so we can fight the boss I need to be strong this is up to the I'm looking for what I'm looking for the halls of dead find it find it
[360:23.14]Dude, this dude chugged that entire bottle.
[360:27.49]Yeah.
[360:30.59]Why do I think that's so funny?
[360:39.37]I played a ton of Diablo 3, now you're making me get Diablo II.
[360:42.99]Diablo II is a fantastic game.
[360:45.31]It's an incredible experience.
[360:46.77]It's one of the best games ever.
[360:50.19]It's one of the best games ever.
[360:53.27]Found it.
[360:54.19]Also dead.
[361:00.78]Let's make a little spot here.
[361:01.98]Oh, we don't have any more mages, so let's get them.
[361:07.24]Sapphire.
[361:07.74]I burnt.
[361:21.82]an embarrassing amount of time in these games.
[361:29.43]There's truly, truly so much time.
[361:34.60]I don't remember much from when I was 16, except for playing Diablo II when I got out of school.
[361:48.64]Uh, every day.
[361:49.60]Every single day.
[361:51.27]And even out of high school into college, every day.
[361:59.41]Uh, this is a bad room.
[362:04.35]I gotta get in here.
[362:04.93]I gotta help.
[362:09.43]Too many people.
[362:12.49]Uh...
[362:20.84]in these rooms.
[362:21.38]I gotta kill the guy resurrecting.
[362:34.73]Get over here.
[362:39.19]Come on, hit this.
[362:41.33]I have no dexterity.
[362:44.53]Right.
[362:45.18]I forgot.
[362:59.21]How we doing?
[362:59.55]Just one mage?
[363:03.11]How fuck does this build for late game?
[363:09.26]On a scale of... We're gonna hit a wall when I get to the boss of this act.
[363:19.66]It's really gonna determine if this is gonna be even humanly possible.
[363:29.79]No good items.
[363:31.79]Annoying.
[363:35.22]I really wish I had more skeletons.
[363:38.00]I wish that I had more skeletons and they were stronger.
[363:42.32]You know, I mean, if we're going to put 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 points into skeletons, I really, you know, just wish they were just a tad stronger than they are now.
[364:01.58]Bonewall's cool, don't get me wrong.
[364:10.53]You guys are indecisive.
[364:14.27]Fucking boomers.
[364:25.17]Dex and teeth.
[364:26.74]Got it.
[364:29.83]Uh-oh.
[364:30.43]Uh-oh.
[364:30.83]Uh-oh.
[364:31.17]Uh-oh.
[364:31.52]Uh-oh.
[364:31.90]Uh-oh.
[364:32.14]Uh-oh.
[364:32.64]Uh-oh.
[364:32.90]Don't be an idiot.
[364:34.02]Don't be an idiot.
[364:34.58]Don't be an idiot.
[364:35.10]Don't be an idiot.
[364:35.62]Don't be an idiot.
[364:37.46]There's a fucking... There's a trillion people in this room.
[364:40.60]I gotta go around the corners.
[364:41.44]Okay, we're good.
[365:00.23]OK, we're good.
[365:06.89]Use bone wall?
[365:08.67]For what?
[365:12.71]I already have a bone wall.
[365:13.99]Just standing around swinging at stuff.
[365:19.32]We have a level 2.
[365:36.94]Alright, now's my opportunity.
[365:38.84]Good.
[365:43.62]I gotta wrap or run.
[365:44.90]What is this?
[365:45.22]How many players is this set to?
[365:51.44]Four?
[365:58.80]Come here.
[366:06.61]Only one unique this whole game so far.
[366:09.85]Sad.
[366:10.13]Yeah, well...
[366:30.17]It's arguably one of the reasons why I'm doing okay.
[366:32.19]Because it's just a dump of health, a ton more hit recovery, which is a huge deal in this game.
[366:39.75]Hit recovery will kill you more than anything else.
[366:56.82]I remember pre-expansion never getting a unique.
[367:00.41]It happened.
[367:02.13]It did happen.
[367:03.49]Once you start playing on Nightmare in Hell, though, they drop all over the place.
[367:06.13]Especially from the bosses.
[367:07.06]A boss will drop a unique.
[367:11.06]Or a set.
[367:13.16]At least one out of every... Especially if you have Magic Find.
[367:16.04]Magic Find is so important in this game.
[367:18.76]And if I'm going to be a... Why am I talking like I'm going to be able to do this?
[367:24.95]Once we get to Nightmare in Hell, I'm going to have 200% Magic Find.
[367:33.63]It's not happening.
[367:34.29]I'll be lucky to get the axe free.
[367:43.60]You're underestimating the bones.
[367:46.30]It is good.
[367:46.82]Alright, we're just level 2.
[367:55.71]Looking for the cube.
[367:57.11]It's in here somewhere.
[368:02.32]Like, if I was a... Now he's getting class jealous.
[368:08.01]He's getting class jealous.
[368:09.03]This is bad.
[368:11.53]If I was a sorceress right now, I would melt this whole room in one second.
[368:15.40]It would just be like...
[368:32.11]be very interesting.
[368:33.13]If I had Nova right now, I would just walk in a room, right-click three times, and run to the next room.
[368:40.38]It'd be great.
[368:52.08]He doesn't respect our choices.
[368:54.52]No, I do, which is why I'm playing it.
[368:58.06]I could have said at the beginning of the stream, no, no, no, no.
[369:01.20]I don't... I don't want to do skeletons.
[369:03.76]No, stop.
[369:05.04]Stop.
[369:05.70]No, I'm done.
[369:07.22]Hey, we're still here.
[369:14.74]We kind of did.
[369:15.46]No, I didn't.
[369:19.39]Why am I so good at beatboxing?
[369:20.93]I'm not really.
[369:24.13]I can just go like this and this and this pretty much it resist fire
[369:47.83]I got a taste in my mouth.
[369:50.27]What was it?
[369:52.10]I just sensed a flavor of some sort.
[369:55.26]I'm trying to figure out what it was.
[369:56.38]I just smelt it and tasted something.
[369:59.02]It was like a chard.
[370:02.50]What is that?
[370:04.07]I just got like this random memory of a flavor.
[370:09.19]And it was like a charred kind of meat flavor, but it's not meat.
[370:12.17]What was it?
[370:12.93]I don't know.
[370:13.43]This is freaking me out.
[370:14.87]What is it?
[370:19.26]Like a smoke?
[370:20.10]Like a smoky flavor?
[370:28.18]Very charred though.
[370:39.67]Stove.
[370:42.59]Oh, shit!
[370:44.53]It's been on all day!
[370:45.51]Hey, waypoint.
[370:54.91]Now, I can run my friends through the whole game in less than 40 minutes.
[371:02.28]Oh, but I can't play online because I was banned from Battle.net.
[371:19.29]Oh, I had a dream about this stream, actually.
[371:23.09]So, I had a dream that... So, I got this wallet.
[371:26.69]No, this is the dream happening.
[371:28.33]Okay, so I got this wallet recently, and I actually really like it.
[371:32.93]It's great.
[371:34.43]It's this shiny, metal, small, like, travel wallet, right?
[371:40.23]It's... My dream's happening right now.
[371:43.00]It's called The Ridge.
[371:46.40]It's actually a great wallet.
[371:47.76]It's fantastic.
[371:50.05]It's really good.
[371:52.64]I had a dream last night that I was sponsored by this company that makes this wallet.
[372:00.75]I don't know why.
[372:01.33]For some reason.
[372:03.03]And I was nervously doing a presentation for it while the chat... And there were like 30,000 people here for some reason.
[372:12.63]And it was just a wall, a spam of like, I'm fucking out of here.
[372:17.70]Unsubbing loser, you piece of shit.
[372:20.18]Fuck you.
[372:21.28]Fucking loser.
[372:22.10]How dare you?
[372:22.90]And it was like, no, no, people weren't joking.
[372:29.65]It was like, last stream I'll ever go to, just a wall of just, everyone was so mad.
[372:36.62]And I'm sitting there going like, and did you see the... And I kept looking over and going, oh, if... If fucking anyone hates this, but like I am doing it.
[372:45.17]And as you can see, you can fit like 10 credit cards in here.
[372:47.85]I was getting so nervous.
[372:51.57]It was a sponsored dream.
[372:52.98]Yeah.
[372:53.20]I don't have any friends.
[373:00.98]Where'd they all go?
[373:07.76]He'll help hide, okay.
[373:09.48]Give me the cube so I can get out of here.
[373:36.23]He thinks we hate him in his dreams.
[373:41.29]You know, I think dream you.
[373:46.39]Dream you, at least I'm gonna give you some of the benefit of the doubt here.
[373:49.75]Dream you guys?
[373:50.79]It just came out of nowhere.
[373:53.56]I didn't say, hey guys, like tomorrow's gonna be a sponsored segment.
[373:56.50]Or, hey guys, this is gonna be a stream tomorrow.
[373:58.20]Hey guys, this is company.
[373:59.92]No.
[374:00.70]It was just, I turned on my webcam and started going and was stone-faced just doing an ad.
[374:05.37]That wasn't a joke.
[374:07.25]So it was just like, what is this, Jeremy?
[374:10.81]My face was like kind of red.
[374:16.28]The wallets are great.
[374:18.04]They really are.
[374:18.90]I love it.
[374:25.69]This is pretty scummy.
[374:26.88]Seems like we were right.
[374:36.10]No, but it wasn't even stuff like, oh, unsubbed.
[374:40.04]I'm out of here.
[374:41.06]It was real mean, horrible shit.
[374:47.41]It wasn't just like, oh, unsubbed.
[374:48.71]LOL.
[375:03.24]You know.
[375:03.60]Kefe hands.
[375:07.34]Where is the cube?
[375:09.53]Where is the cube?
[375:12.75]I'm getting so unlucky.
[375:13.73]You wonder why this has been six hours into Act 1.
[375:17.55]Act 2.
[375:17.89]Whatever.
[375:18.21]It's because I keep... My RNG is so bad.
[375:20.48]I can't get... Okay.
[375:21.46]I think this is it.
[375:40.36]What should I have for dinner?
[375:41.40]Hm?
[375:44.90]Any food suggestions in the chat here?
[375:48.18]Only good ones, please.
[375:53.33]No, not pizza.
[375:56.51]No, no, not pizza.
[375:57.51]Someone else.
[376:08.86]Japanese salmon.
[376:10.14]I don't really have an idea.
[376:15.92]Ster fry?
[376:16.48]That's not bad.
[376:16.96]Sounds pretty good.
[376:24.02]I wonder what that flavor was, though.
[376:27.18]I don't remember.
[376:29.74]This is still not the cube room.
[376:37.32]How have I not found the cube yet?
[376:38.86]I have no idea.
[376:43.91]Oh, the cube.
[376:44.51]I already found the cube.
[376:45.55]It's in the room down here.
[376:46.51]What am I... Did I not see it?
[376:50.74]How did I not see this?
[376:57.68]Cube.
[377:03.24]Okay.
[377:04.08]There it is.
[377:04.58]The Horadric Cube.
[377:10.25]You have quite a treasure there in that Horadric Cube.
[377:13.87]You have... You have quite a treasure there.
[377:16.91]You have... I'm trying.
[377:18.09]I'll get it.
[377:18.75]You have quite a treasure there in that Horadric Cube.
[377:27.91]You ready?
[377:31.75]Bingo.
[377:35.24]more flawed sapphire hey he's available he's available he's a yes I'm available
[378:08.58]Anymore?
[378:08.96]Nope, that's it.
[378:13.42]What am I holding onto this for?
[378:24.26]These rings are terrible.
[378:27.42]Sell it.
[378:36.27]Get rid of this thing.
[378:37.23]It's taking up space.
[378:50.65]Okay prepare Save the money
[379:11.89]You can convert three rings into an amulet.
[379:13.61]Yeah, that's true, but... No.
[379:19.31]No.
[379:19.73]Alright, let's go.
[379:25.47]Time to find... Oh, the maggot lair.
[379:30.61]The best place in the game.
[379:34.74]Best place in the game.
[379:36.34]Damn it.
[379:53.81]Like, that's so hard.
[379:55.70]Ugh, god damn it.
[379:58.08]Ugh.
[379:58.80]I have to... Somebody watched my stream for like 60 hours.
[380:02.16]I have to turn on my camera and go like this.
[380:05.93]God damn it.
[380:06.73]It's like such a... So hard to do that, apparently.
[380:23.52]Stony Tomb.
[380:24.60]Alright, Fire Oasis.
[380:27.44]I'm making pretty good time in Act 2.
[380:30.18]What, did Act 1 take like 6 hours?
[380:31.82]We're like... We're almost like halfway through Act 2 and it's been like 40 minutes.
[380:49.94]Shit, stamina.
[380:50.46]Stamina.
[381:01.90]Because you didn't spend a half an hour allocating stats.
[381:05.39]Well... But you guys had to do that.
[381:10.83]You guys had to know the tree.
[381:12.43]Now you guys know the tree.
[381:14.45]You know kind of the direction you want to take the character.
[381:16.61]And we can move forward.
[381:26.10]You're blaming us.
[381:29.50]Yes.
[381:30.42]Yeah.
[381:39.02]Every time I hear the ring drop, I just want it to be unique so bad.
[381:44.02]These little shits are the worst.
[381:58.39]Has he died yet?
[381:59.67]Nope.
[382:01.77]I have not.
[382:21.70]Arctic Binding.
[382:24.92]Plus 40 cold... Hey, and guess who that's for?
[382:28.04]Guess who that's going to be great for?
[382:29.82]The boss of this act.
[382:35.67]30 defense and 40% cold resistance.
[382:41.18]Take a look at this shit.
[382:44.58]It's almost 60.
[382:45.54]Oh, I lose a slot, but it's alright.
[382:48.56]Almost 60%.
[382:50.38]Hold resist.
[382:51.16]Good, ResidentSleeper.
[382:52.24]Wake up!
[382:52.70]Wake up, man!
[382:53.44]Wake up, bro!
[382:54.96]Wake up!
[382:57.79]Alright, don't stand still in hardcore, would you, dumb?
[383:03.11]Alright.
[383:15.24]I need more mages for that.
[383:23.52]Wake me up when we're at 100 strength.
[383:31.91]Where's my pancakes?
[383:34.85]How am I responsible for getting new pancakes?
[383:38.65]You got to take care of your own pancakes, if you will.
[383:50.62]What time is it?
[383:51.52]It's not that bad.
[383:52.10]It's like 9.30.
[383:52.40]Oh, there's a Nephilim.
[384:05.69]It's 2.20.
[384:06.19]Ah, right, right, right.
[384:07.27]I live on the other side of the world.
[384:09.01]Um, well...
[384:12.48]It's been six and a half hours.
[384:13.32]We'll see where we're at in like 30 minutes.
[384:23.59]What do you guys think?
[384:24.41]You guys want a conclusion to this?
[384:27.85]I mean, I feel like we kind of have to see the conclusion.
[384:39.27]Gotta keep going until you die.
[384:44.99]Alright, I need bar or waste.
[384:46.89]I think it's bar.
[384:47.55]Is bar or waste connected to dry hill?
[384:50.78]Don't get off until you die.
[384:51.72]Well, that's probably not going to happen.
[384:59.54]I'm going to get back up here.
[385:06.31]How are you even still alive?
[385:07.97]Because chat accidentally made a character that wasn't completely useless.
[385:11.39]Oh.
[385:24.29]That sucks.
[385:29.96]We knew what we were doing.
[385:31.26]Yeah, that's why I'm still alive.
[385:34.30]I don't think 14 or 15 points in teeth would get us this far.
[385:46.31]It just wouldn't.
[385:47.39]It just would not have happened.
[386:00.77]Yes, it would have.
[386:03.29]Ridge wallets are real.
[386:07.74]Yeah, I have one.
[386:09.02]I know.
[386:11.26]But I didn't mean that it wasn't part of the dream.
[386:13.89]Part of the dream was not that the wallets weren't real.
[386:28.90]Stupid ass.
[386:30.54]Get out of here.
[386:32.60]Look at the Ridge Wallet in my spaghetti.
[386:44.71]I only talk about products that are actually useful.
[386:52.03]JetBlue.
[386:52.91]Useful product.
[386:54.23]Ridge Wallet.
[386:55.31]A very useful actual product that you should probably get if you need a wallet.
[387:01.74]Nothing to do with them.
[387:02.90]I just know.
[387:03.28]Because I use them on them.
[387:13.73]This is my last time being here.
[387:30.06]This stamina is killing me.
[387:34.46]Commit to the joke.
[387:35.16]Show the wallet on the camera.
[387:39.49]I mean, I do... You really want me to go get my Ridge wallet?
[387:44.45]And show you?
[387:46.39]I mean, it's... It's not much to see.
[387:48.65]It's just a wallet.
[387:57.04]No, yeah.
[387:57.98]I've got, like... I've got, like, credit cards and my license in there and shit.
[388:01.84]I'm not doing that.
[388:02.54]What?
[388:06.40]I'll just, I can just take, I'll take him out.
[388:10.94]There we go, far oasis.
[388:11.72]I'm walking so slow.
[388:17.85]Actually not a terrible charm.
[388:22.73]Pretty good charm, actually, for right now.
[388:33.07]Champion in there, watch it.
[388:40.83]They're getting melted.
[388:42.01]Jesus.
[388:48.80]Oh, it's because this guy's here.
[388:53.74]Ah!
[388:54.28]OK.
[388:56.08]Ooh, a jewel.
[389:09.09]Sucks.
[389:09.41]I can sell it, though.
[389:15.55]He's lying about the wallet.
[389:20.31]No, I own one.
[389:21.71]I'll get it in a minute.
[389:22.72]Well, when we take break two, that's the last break of the night, I will get the Ridge wallet and I will show you the wallet.
[389:40.92]The picky bugs.
[389:42.00]Yes, lots of bugs.
[389:46.52]This is why this part sucked.
[389:48.46]Because there's so many random enemies everywhere.
[389:51.34]I'm close to the maggot though.
[389:59.09]Ooh, the zombie head.
[390:02.19]You're right, this could be plus to something good.
[390:05.36]Okay, alright.
[390:06.70]Well, now, thank you for telling me to go get that one guy.
[390:09.80]Because this is +2 to Ray Skeleton, one to Clay Golem, and one to Bone Wolf.
[390:17.44]I lose Corpse Explosion and weaken, don't care, I didn't use them anyways.
[390:21.77]Go.
[390:25.73]How many can I have now?
[390:30.29]That's it?
[390:31.67]With eight points?
[390:32.99]Oh, the next point is five.
[390:58.76]let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go oh the bugs I forgot about the bugs
[391:14.73]swarm and yeah they're killing everything oh off you ridge wallet shill
[391:47.99]Alright, I'm gonna get it.
[391:49.57]I'm gonna go get it.
[391:50.21]Just hold on.
[391:53.23]I also want to get the enact two.
[392:00.05]Up here.
[392:01.49]That's higher.
[392:04.71]We're about to kill Kyle, by the way.
[392:06.19]Alright, defensive.
[392:09.86]We want offensive, defensive, or combat.
[392:12.60]That's the aura.
[392:13.84]Probably defensive.
[392:19.98]I want a level 19... 19 defense.
[392:25.80]Doesn't exist.
[392:27.10]Offense?
[392:28.46]Level 19 offense.
[392:33.77]Alright, yeah.
[392:38.05]What are the different auras?
[392:38.77]Combat is probably better.
[392:43.87]Combat's like Blessing of Might, whatever it is.
[392:46.03]Combat aura is healing.
[392:47.92]Healing.
[392:50.87]It's the regen aura.
[392:51.69]Probably not a bad idea.
[392:59.27]Let us pick it when you piss.
[393:00.89]Defense is just pure defense.
[393:03.01]And offense is, I think, attack power, right?
[393:04.55]Alright, let us pick.
[393:06.70]Yeah, I'm going to go pee.
[393:07.60]I'll let you guys pick and I'll come back.
[393:10.42]I'll make the pull.
[393:12.78]Wait one second.
[393:22.21]Let's drop hole.
[393:24.81]Bring the wallet back?
[393:25.61]I will.
[393:28.82]And we can... We'll play for another 30-40 minutes and see how everyone's feeling.
[393:34.98]It's going to start to get late.
[393:52.57]Okay, vote on this, and I'll be back in about two or three minutes.
[393:58.63]See you in a minute.
[395:23.97]Thank you.
[396:00.25]Thank you.
[397:00.10]Guys the wall is not real.
[397:34.78]I fucking made it up.
[397:44.02]Or did I?
[397:48.92]This is the wallet right here.
[397:54.03]Here it is.
[397:54.41]Look at how thin this is.
[398:04.31]This opens to store cards.
[398:06.99]You can slide, I believe, up to 20 cards in here.
[398:10.38]And it looks like an SSD.
[398:12.72]There's all kinds of styles with this thing.
[398:16.32]You can see the little thumb thing here.
[398:18.90]If you get cards in here, you just push, slide them when you want out, slide it right back in.
[398:24.51]It's easy.
[398:25.03]Cast strap on the back.
[398:26.25]Secure.
[398:32.55]Ridge wallet.
[398:35.68]pick one up maybe if you feel like getting a new wallet right they're really good they're very good they're secure they're they fit into pants you can actually put this into like a jacket pocket
[399:00.30]You put your essentials in here.
[399:01.56]It's light.
[399:02.60]It's got a nice click to it.
[399:04.52]It's very sturdy.
[399:06.76]Never coming back.
[399:07.50]I'm never coming back.
[399:08.54]Well... Alright.
[399:12.94]What did you guys pick?
[399:18.27]Offense.
[399:19.53]Apparently it's offense.
[399:23.95]Alright.
[399:24.11]Alright.
[399:27.16]Uh, look for 11-19 offensive.
[399:28.42]There we go.
[399:30.04]Uh, Leharas?
[399:32.68]Or... What's his offense?
[399:38.17]Ilzan?
[399:40.45]Zanari?
[399:42.87]Or, uh, Vikyat?
[399:46.65]Vikyat.
[399:47.15]Life 270 versus 270-155 are either the same.

[400:56.08]Phylactery Lich, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[400:58.65]$50, they say.
[401:01.19]Derm of the Ridge is fucking $75.
[401:02.99]It's quality.
[401:10.52]It's a quality product.
[401:11.98]The thing's made out of fucking steel.
[401:22.06]You can get the same thing for $15.
[401:23.26]This thing's made out of fucking steel, guys.
[401:37.34]Does it protect against card skimming?
[401:39.30]What a great question.
[401:41.26]What a great question.
[401:42.62]Seriously.
[401:56.99]It does.
[401:57.41]It has RFID blocking inside of it.
[402:07.65]There you go.
[402:08.25]Blocks RFID.
[402:19.06]Does it do your taxes?
[402:20.42]It's also got an integrated expandable track.
[402:25.77]section of the wallet's pure metal plates.
[402:29.81]The T-design of the track secures cards from the bottom as well as the sides, so nothing accidentally falls out of the bottom of the wallet.
[402:36.45]It'll snugly hold one card or expand to hold numerous cards.
[402:40.95]The track is made out of a robust elastic material that has undergone several strength tests.
[402:46.60]It can expand to hold up to 15 cards.
[402:49.62]And when the cards are removed, it will contract to hold a single card securely with the most pure of fucking iron and aluminum, metal, and steel.
[402:56.80]And it's pure steel.
[402:58.94]15 cards.
[402:59.66]Your actual, your local Walmart little compact wallet cannot hold 15 fucking cards securely.
[403:04.35]Sorry, I'm sorry.
[403:05.11]That's completely incorrect.
[403:14.91]That was a sneaky way to do an ad.
[403:22.26]Adblock isn't working.
[403:25.96]I like it.
[403:26.50]I like it.
[403:27.54]Nobody gave... I... Nobody gave me... I like these things.
[403:31.16]I like this thing.
[403:32.43]I like it.
[403:33.31]I like it.
[403:37.17]Next, you're gonna send me, like, a review of that I can't piss in my Berkey.
[403:42.27]Okay.
[403:43.13]Alright.
[403:43.51]Fine.
[403:44.25]That's fine.
[403:44.83]Whatever.
[403:57.88]Things made out of solid fucking like carbon steel or something.
[404:00.74]I don't know.
[404:03.39]The Berkey?
[404:03.77]It's my water filter and everybody made fun of me because I said it sucked.
[404:06.55]But you can clean... You can literally take food dye out of water.
[404:10.61]Alright, I'm not even going to get started on that.
[404:16.83]What race do I have?
[404:22.30]There's nothing the right portion can't cure.
[404:34.37]Show the water filter.
[404:35.57]Yeah, let me go get the water filter.
[404:37.63]Let me go and pick up this clunky, huge, hard-to-move-around thing and bring it into this office.
[404:44.45]It quotes it's an office in quotes, of course.
[404:47.54]Of course.
[404:49.36]I'm not going to go get a Berkey filter and filter as... No, I'm not doing that.
[404:55.16]No, no.
[404:55.76]Do you know how hard that is to move over here?
[404:57.93]This thing's huge.
[404:58.61]It holds like two gallons of water.
[405:08.65]What, you want me to go get the Berkey filter and pour chocolate milk in it and see what happens?
[405:13.07]I'm not gonna do that.
[405:15.49]Find the YouTube channel that already did.
[405:17.14]Alright, let's go.
[405:22.44]Pick some stats, please, if you could.
[405:25.81]Oh, there's still time.
[405:37.80]water filter stream.
[405:45.86]Why would that be cool?
[405:49.02]It would be me just drinking water, it would be drinking water.
[405:55.69]What would what's the you want me to bring the Berkey up here and filter water through it, and then drink the water.
[406:10.97]Do you want me to tell you how it tastes?
[406:22.73]Yes.
[406:24.67]Doing a water review.
[406:28.46]Or milk and coffee in it.
[406:31.14]I'm not going to ruin my water filter.
[406:43.35]no it's that you want to talk about expensive it was expensive it was like a hundred something dollars for the that is just thirsty alright we're putting this into decks no which one come on get a pick one just buy a new one
[407:18.72]What would happen if you filtered Gatorade?
[407:21.30]I don't know.
[407:21.82]I don't know.
[407:24.04]It would get clogged up.
[407:27.64]And it would just be a waste.
[407:33.34]Let's find out.
[407:34.20]This is not going to be as interesting as you guys think it is.
[407:45.73]Alright, we're doing Vitality.
[407:52.72]What about skill point?
[407:55.70]Category, please.
[408:06.29]That's a worse stream of the new decade?
[408:08.11]I guess I did build a birdhouse on stream.
[408:17.32]That's true.
[408:21.05]Yeah, I built a birdhouse.
[408:24.47]I could filter fucking Gatorade.
[408:26.27]Oh, waste of time, that's gonna be and then tell you what happens.
[408:34.39]100% of you are.
[408:38.92]So what?
[408:39.16]What do you want me to?
[408:40.94]What do you want to do?
[408:57.05]Oh, you want the fifth skeleton.
[408:59.05]Would you look at you guys picking things that'll help us through our journey.
[409:07.47]And then Bugleberry drinks it.
[409:10.16]And then he has to give a review.
[409:13.22]Alright, let's get the next skeleton.
[409:28.41]Thanks for voting.
[409:33.75]Vitality.
[409:34.37]65 vitality.
[409:35.03]Kind of good.
[409:36.75]215.
[409:36.77]Alright.
[409:39.70]We have five skeletons now.
[409:44.60]Finally.
[409:45.06]It only took a million years.
[409:55.67]This is a good charm.
[409:59.25]recovery and lightning resistance is very important I'm gonna save the rings no because I'm going to I don't need to tell you a reason for everything that I do I have to tell you a reason for everything to explain everything I have to do wait how are you still alive this is how
[410:27.86]I'll show you a few ways that this could have been a disaster.
[410:30.69]This, if you... You could have just put every single point into this.
[410:35.67]And I would have no moves.
[410:36.51]Okay?
[410:37.31]Same with here.
[410:38.39]You could have put every point into Bonewall.
[410:41.23]You could have put... Every point into Terror.
[410:44.87]And I would just have people run around and scream while I find a way to kill them.
[410:50.65]I mean, even Bone Prison is... Some of these are bad.
[410:56.11]You could have put all your points into Golem Mastery and put one point in Clay Golem and that's it.
[411:00.55]And then max out Skeletal Mage.
[411:03.61]It would have ruined everything.
[411:05.41]Don't give ideas.
[411:06.29]I'm just telling you.
[411:06.89]You guys are doing a pretty good job.
[411:19.73]Remember to look at chat.
[411:20.59]I am.
[411:22.05]What do you think I'm not?
[411:27.71]our new friend out here.
[411:29.01]We get five skeletons now.
[411:39.54]The plan, though, is once you get more than 15... Why was I going to say community subs?
[411:52.93]When you get more than 15 community subs, you will start overwhelming people.
[412:00.52]That's when it's a battle.
[412:01.66]That's how you know you've made it.
[412:14.86]How you guys doing tonight?
[412:15.72]You guys doing good?
[412:17.14]You guys chilling?
[412:18.62]I'm just chilling.
[412:21.70]Ooh, superior zombie head.
[412:23.02]Leave it.
[412:23.28]Alright, we're looking for the, uh, maggot lair.
[412:33.89]So I can hate my life.
[412:41.96]You know, I want to keep playing, but it's getting late.
[413:00.61]Do this again tomorrow.
[413:03.35]Um, I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.
[413:06.83]The reason why we did this today is because Joel was having computer problems today.
[413:10.23]I was like, you know what?
[413:11.53]I thought about doing this a while ago.
[413:12.79]Why don't we just do it now?
[413:13.57]I don't know what his schedule is like over the next couple of days, but we're probably going to do keep talking.
[413:19.02]Nobody explodes.
[413:21.36]If not tomorrow, then the next day.
[413:23.04]We have that tomorrow, the next day, whenever, over the next few days, we just got to figure it out when his computer is good to go.
[413:31.50]Do the filter stream tomorrow.
[413:46.87]Joel's streaming right now.
[413:48.11]Well, then that means he must have figured it out.
[414:07.96]Do a water filter test.
[414:10.58]Test different water filters.
[414:17.61]What a weird stream.
[414:29.92]Water filter test.
[414:33.12]Where I break down how- what the flavor of the different water filters is.
[414:38.19]Pure, Brita, Furky.
[414:40.15]I mean, you're talking about expensive jokes.
[414:47.33]That's- I mean, that's- What am I gonna do with them all?
[414:54.39]I guess I could donate them?
[415:02.88]I don't know what I would do with them.
[415:11.58]Did I not find the Magetalir yet?
[415:22.62]No, no, I mean, no, I'm talking about... Guys, I'm not gonna put anything, like, fucked up in these filters.
[415:33.21]Let's see what happens when we filter orange juice.
[415:36.18]This is gonna come out as orange juice.
[415:38.40]This is gonna taste gross.
[415:49.78]How do you know?
[415:50.32]I don't know.
[415:51.00]I don't know.
[415:51.76]I actually don't know the answer to this question.
[416:04.47]Alright, where's this?
[416:05.21]Where is it?
[416:06.87]It's the maggot lair under the far oasis.
[416:09.49]Come on.
[416:12.61]Right here somewhere.
[416:15.37]You need to figure this out.
[416:16.39]You have to be a scientist.
[416:32.32]Anybody see a little hole in the ground?
[416:40.81]No, I can't pee in the Berkey.
[416:46.21]You do realize that if I pee in the Berkey, I'm going to get banned from Twitch.
[416:54.70]Even if I do this off camera, I'm gone.
[417:00.06]I'm out.
[417:00.40]I'm gone.
[417:14.40]Derma985 so obsessed with proving to his loyal audience that the Berkey filter is legit, pees in water filter on stream and drinks it to prove a point.
[417:26.41]And then gets permanently suspended from twitch.tv and his partner status revoked.
[417:30.23]Alright, where the hell is this place?
[417:44.82]It would be infamous.
[417:49.19]Yes.
[417:50.83]Sure.
[417:51.15]Oh, I hate running so slow.
[418:02.05]Dude, you would be a fucking legend.
[418:09.79]I don't give a shit.
[418:13.55]about being the guy that peed in the Berkey.
[418:17.23]Do you think I care more about that or being able to like continue to stream and hang out and have fun and continue doing what I'm doing?
[418:27.80]What do you think is more important to me right now?
[418:38.12]Wait, hold on a minute.
[418:40.52]You're telling me that I can be the guy that pisses in a water filter and drinks it.
[418:46.66]Everybody remembers me.
[418:48.66]And laughs at that crazy thing I did.
[418:51.72]Oh, I lost all my partner status.
[418:58.57]And eventually after that... I lose everything.
[419:05.07]Every cent I own.
[419:11.50]The only reason why people will even talk about it is to laugh at me.
[419:19.24]Or I could have just played Diablo II and enjoyed myself.
[419:26.44]No, good thing I pissed in that thing and one person every six months remembers me for 15 seconds.
[419:38.50]Yeah, it was me.
[419:40.44]It was me.
[419:46.55]Oh man, those were the days.
[419:53.21]Grandpa, grandpa!
[419:54.31]Yeah, yep.
[419:58.37]Grandpa, wait.
[420:01.70]You're... You're pissing Perry?
[420:03.76]Yeah, that's me.
[420:06.68]Wow, no way!
[420:09.28]Are you serious?
[420:11.02]Yeah.
[420:12.20]I've seen so many top techs, bottom techs about you.
[420:18.31]Wow, I can't believe that's so crazy.
[420:20.15]We were talking about you the other day for 15 seconds and then didn't bring you up for like a year.
[420:24.11]Yeah.
[420:26.33]I lost out on like 7 million dollars.
[420:30.39]Wow, cool.
[420:31.72]Cool, Grandpa.
[420:32.42]Okay.
[420:52.05]We saw you in this funny meme compilation video.
[420:59.88]It had 20 million views.
[421:02.82]Yeah, I don't get any of that money.
[421:05.18]I don't get any of that.
[421:07.15]Oh, but people saw it.
[421:08.13]Yeah, they did.
[421:09.69]No, no, haven't seen a dime of that one.
[421:20.31]Just piss and parry.
[421:25.38]Son, do your grandfather a favor and go get him his favorite Berkey.
[421:32.03]Grandson goes and gets it.
[421:33.17]He's like, oh, this thing sticks.
[421:45.93]But what's in there?
[421:47.67]Ah, you know.
[421:49.49]Piss.
[421:52.99]I've learned to love it.
[421:54.35]In fact, it was crazy because right after that stream, I could never drink regular water again.
[422:00.12]All I could drink was filtered piss.
[422:11.31]So delicious.
[422:23.31]I'm gonna die.
[422:24.37]I'm gonna die.
[422:24.95]I'm gonna die.
[422:27.13]The grandson has the YouTuber voice.
[422:29.03]Because the grandson is probably a YouTuber.
[422:52.16]Found it.
[422:59.74]Two decks get out of here.
[423:03.20]Here it comes.
[423:04.04]Here comes the end of the character.
[423:06.34]No, no, no, no.
[423:09.13]It's gonna be fine.
[423:10.07]This place sucks notoriously.
[423:11.67]Let's just be real.
[423:18.49]We're getting into arguments about stuff.
[423:22.52]Yeah, pissing Perry over here.
[423:23.90]He couldn't even figure out how to keep his channel going.
[423:28.21]You don't even have 5,000 subs on YouTube, you little shit!
[423:35.42]You know how many subs I had before the great pissing of 2020?
[423:38.64]More than you'll ever have in your life, kid!
[424:03.85]And what I don't know is he recorded that.
[424:07.66]The whole thing.
[424:09.02]And he uploaded it to his YouTube channel.
[424:11.68]And it got 20 million views.
[424:20.37]And then he makes five videos after that.
[424:24.69]Talking about it and laughing about it.
[424:26.71]So do all of his YouTube friends.
[424:29.15]All of them.
[424:30.05]Are making, like, reaction videos to this.
[424:33.26]We're talking, like, six to seven hundred million views across, like, fifty different channels.
[424:37.90]And Pissing Perry just sits in his fucking rocking chair.
[424:39.90]Doesn't see a dime.
[424:46.25]Doesn't see a dime.
[424:49.45]Get over here, everybody.
[424:50.17]Come on.
[424:59.62]Don't get stuck.
[425:00.42]If anyone's gonna get stuck, it's gonna be one of you.
[425:10.57]No!
[425:11.27]Come on, Vik.
[425:13.09]He's okay.
[425:14.33]He's doing alright.
[425:14.89]He's actually pretty good.
[425:25.31]Who thought this was gonna end here?
[425:27.01]You were wrong.
[425:33.56]We're good.
[425:33.94]How many people we got?
[425:34.78]We need more.
[425:35.25]Alright, we got eight, nine, we got ten companions.
[425:45.19]It's not gonna end here, it just sucks because it takes forever.
[425:48.81]This is why if I was a sorceress I could just right-click and do Frozen Orb and just walk forward.
[425:58.49]Tell us more about how you love- when did I say I love doing that?
[426:07.11]Alright, I'm not going to get justification for why I can pee into a Berkey on stream.
[426:12.73]I don't know who did it.
[426:14.59]I don't know who drank pee already.
[426:17.14]I'm not... Hey, you know this guy drank pee already.
[426:20.52]That's okay.
[426:21.44]That's fine.
[426:22.64]Oh, good for you.
[426:23.58]Good for whoever that was.
[426:24.92]I'm not going to drink piss on stream.
[426:28.44]You're trying to somehow justify me being able to drink pee on this stream.
[426:35.28]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[426:41.06]Are you serious?
[426:43.22]Are we actually talking about that?
[426:48.63]You can't be serious.
[426:50.79]Bear Grylls did it.
[427:05.43]He didn't even use a filter.
[427:06.61]Yes, he did.
[427:07.03]He buried it into the ground.
[427:08.11]He peed in the ground and buried it and then the soil sucked up the fucking... ...ammonia that's in the piss and he was clean or whatever.
[427:15.07]I don't know.
[427:15.39]I saw like a- I've watched that like a year- Alright, we're gonna have to stop putting people up here.
[427:30.78]Put people in front.
[427:35.03]This is going to take forever.
[427:36.61]That's fine.
[427:38.41]Just stuff everybody up there.
[427:39.97]Come on.
[427:44.21]Push through.
[427:46.37]He's thought about this already.
[427:47.99]No, Bear Grylls peed into the ground.
[427:50.44]He dug a hole and he peed into it and he waited like three days or something.
[427:55.62]And then when he opened up the hole, the pee was clean.
[427:59.40]Something like that happened.
[428:01.90]Something like that happened.
[428:02.74]I don't know.
[428:03.00]Something weird like that.
[428:04.18]What was it?
[428:04.60]I'm telling you.
[428:06.36]It was like there was pee in the ground and it was like he buried it.
[428:09.06]And on the third day, his piss rose.
[428:13.72]Nothing like that happened.
[428:14.74]What?
[428:15.90]That was one episode.
[428:17.04]Yes, I know.
[428:17.52]A lot of people think I'm crazy.
[428:26.08]I swear to God, this happened.
[428:41.65]That is so dumb, is what somebody said.
[428:43.97]No, he did not do that.
[428:50.09]He did not pee.
[428:54.45]He did not pee up.
[428:55.63]That would be such a shitty survival technique.
[429:01.45]Imagine telling somebody to just sit down and pee in the air.
[429:09.83]No, that's not how you survive.
[429:11.57]That didn't happen.
[429:12.31]Alright, we need... Where's my Blood Golem?
[429:29.06]Get in there.
[429:31.42]Get in there and cause some mayhem.
[429:33.34]We need to cause some mayhem.
[429:36.87]Turn around.
[429:37.47]What, you can't even see the person behind you?
[429:39.11]Spaghetti!
[429:40.11]Turn around, Mr. Spaghetti!
[429:41.75]Alright, now you're in the way.
[429:53.76]What year is this?
[429:57.06]I knew that I was going to piss so many people off.
[430:00.22]I knew that I was going to just piss like a thousand people off.
[430:04.44]the second they heard it was just like oh no shut up dream is dehydrated oh hey don't worry I'll take care of that in a minute
[430:41.80]17 max stamina?
[430:44.70]Nice, man.
[430:46.90]Pretty cool.
[430:48.38]Nice.
[430:49.84]Actually, I'm starting to lose my mind.
[430:51.20]Whatever.
[430:53.91]It's the maggot lair.
[430:54.87]It does it to you.
[431:10.60]You are making me want some water, though.
[431:12.70]What's your guys' favorite water?
[431:13.98]Favorite, like, bottle of water.
[431:19.13]Am I a rich asshole if I say Fiji?
[431:20.69]No, a lot of people are saying it.
[431:25.55]A lot of people are saying it.
[431:29.63]No, a lot of people are saying it.
[431:30.76]I saw, like, at least 100 people say it.
[431:41.98]Guys, BG is filtered with rocks.
[431:44.74]It naturally gets filtered over the sediment of the rocks.
[431:49.03]That's fake, too.
[431:49.35]Don't die.
[432:12.13]In fact, you gotta be in front of me.
[432:23.10]No, I'm... No, I'm not talking about... I'm not talking about every day.
[432:28.86]I'm talking about just like sometimes.
[432:32.04]Sometimes I'll see it and I go, you know what?
[432:34.53]That sounds good.
[432:36.59]This isn't every day.
[432:44.99]Drink smart water, then.
[432:46.62]I don't think you want to say that.
[432:49.04]I think you just angered a lot of people.
[432:50.74]I don't know what it is.
[432:53.14]For some reason, if you don't drink water out of your tap, and you say, I like this.
[433:02.28]Careful.
[433:04.72]Like, if you don't turn your bathtub on and turn your head over and drink out of the bathtub, apparently you're a crazy person.
[433:15.01]Are you guys drinking out of a garden hose?
[433:16.67]Yeah, seriously.
[433:17.45]No, you know, I don't drink tap water.
[433:24.46]It has fluorine in it.
[433:25.66]I don't want that.
[433:45.32]No, I clicked an ad one time and it told me that I don't want fluorine.
[433:49.32]I was like, alright, I don't want that.
[433:51.43]I stopped buying it.
[433:53.05]Stopped drinking it.
[434:02.11]This place sucks.
[434:03.33]It really does.
[434:09.93]Will somebody get up there?
[434:11.07]I'm so glad I have these mages.
[434:22.37]I need enough potions.
[434:23.51]Alright, wait, wait.
[434:29.75]Hmm.
[434:32.71]15 Ds.
[434:32.91]Should I stick it in there?
[434:33.83]Whatever.
[434:35.79]Not a bad thing.
[434:43.87]I mean, L runes, they drop, like, rain.
[434:46.21]It'll be fine.
[434:52.54]Yeah, just, whatever.
[434:53.22]I'm just going to do it.
[434:55.20]That's 15 plot.
[434:55.80]There's more defense and light radius.
[434:56.96]It's fine.
[435:00.38]We did level up, but we have to get to the end of this.
[435:02.85]I bet that's damaged.
[435:12.08]My tap water is hard water and it's awful tasting.
[435:14.12]Yes, I agree.
[435:16.00]Vegas has really hard water.
[435:19.75]It smells like rust.
[435:35.77]California's got hard water too, yeah?
[435:38.61]That's why those filters exist.
[435:40.49]I don't want to drink rust.
[435:41.51]Jerma, this is the east coast.
[435:56.17]Um...
[436:02.30]I'm not sure I necessarily would have wanted to drink that much tap water in Massachusetts either.
[436:07.27]I don't think Massachusetts has very good water.
[436:08.91]I'm pretty sure it ranks kind of low.
[436:21.31]I'm pretty sure tap water in Boston is really not that great.
[436:24.11]Go dig a hole if you want clean water.
[436:35.67]I need more mages.
[436:36.69]Here we go.
[436:39.77]Here comes the fun part where we sit here while a hundred flies get stuck in the wall.
[436:51.14]Anybody even up there?
[436:51.82]Alright, I'm going to put you up here.
[436:54.00]Get in there.
[436:55.94]Fight.
[437:04.51]Nice gameplay.
[437:08.91]It's at this point that I will agree with you.
[437:13.03]This guy's immune to physical damage.
[437:15.12]That's why.
[437:19.04]Got a guy immune to physical.
[437:21.14]That sucks.
[437:36.88]Come on, mages, get him.
[437:47.09]Alright, I made it through.
[437:55.15]Alright.
[437:58.67]Alright, okay, okay, okay.
[438:01.06]Some more mages.
[438:06.87]Alright, kill Moonbite.
[438:13.74]Jesus.
[438:15.79]I get two hits.
[438:16.59]I get a cell.
[438:39.21]Hey, I can make one.
[438:43.13]And... Four to seven cold damage or mana.
[438:47.66]Nice.
[438:47.92]That's three rings, right?
[438:53.30]Does it make an amulet?
[438:55.72]Yes, it is.
[438:59.10]Filter tier list.
[439:00.96]How does that even work?
[439:04.14]It's like five.
[439:18.27]I gotta get a bunch of these.
[439:26.72]I am starting to run out of mana.
[439:27.86]Alright, let me get through the maggot lair and then we can do points.
[439:38.00]Level 3 is probably up here.
[439:44.47]Yeah... No... If I was a sorceress and I had teleport... You know, I really just wish I was a sorceress, to be honest.
[440:01.80]Who had a sword?
[440:02.46]Oh, fuck, you're right.
[440:09.33]Well, you're not, so... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[440:16.54]Not as good.
[440:19.10]Not as good.
[440:21.56]Kind of sucks.
[440:26.49]If you had to teleport, you would teleport into death.
[440:36.75]Also kind of true.
[440:38.61]That is... Yeah... I would teleport into a bunch of enemies and die.
[440:51.53]I saw the tier list.
[440:54.48]Save it.
[440:54.68]I do tier lists all the time.
[440:57.30]I'm not going to do it right now.
[441:04.62]Come on.
[441:09.26]Just get me to the next level.
[441:12.89]Claw of Hyper Temple is actually going to be painful.
[441:15.61]It's not in here either.
[441:16.53]Shit.
[441:17.89]Let me in.
[441:18.13]Let me in.
[441:31.91]What tier is hose water?
[441:34.58]Of all the tap water, hose water is probably up pretty high.
[441:36.82]I would say.
[441:47.53]There's something about taking a hose that's turned on and tilting it so it makes that arcing fountain and just putting your mouth up and...
[441:57.62]They really can't be beat.
[441:58.50]I put that pretty high on the list.
[442:05.63]Boze Water is dangerous.
[442:08.43]Why?
[442:10.65]Boze Water can kill you.
[442:16.84]It has bacteria and mold in it.
[442:26.61]What's with all the Debbie Downers?
[442:32.40]I have a Berkey.
[442:33.86]Berkeys suck.
[442:34.74]Not even real.
[442:36.70]I love drinking out of a hose on a hot summer day.
[442:38.68]It's going to kill you.
[442:39.20]Bananas are my favorite fruit.
[442:43.52]Radioactive.
[442:44.12]Gross.
[443:06.43]I got this ridge wallet.
[443:07.77]Oh, shit!
[443:09.01]Too expensive.
[443:09.95]It is.
[443:11.09]But still.
[443:26.66]An honest shill.
[443:32.14]No, I was a shill in my dream, but I'm not in a shill in real life for that.
[443:39.64]Hold on a second.
[443:48.64]Am I getting told... How many... Let's be honest.
[443:52.61]How many of you guys vape?
[443:55.13]How many of you guys have a jewel in your pocket right now?
[444:02.70]I know a lot of you do.
[444:03.48]You know you can get pneumonia.
[444:09.80]From fucking vaping, you know that, right?
[444:33.43]I stopped, okay?
[444:35.39]Good.
[444:40.12]Jeremy thinks his fanbase is all Zoomers.
[444:45.32]Well, considering how many of you guys didn't know the game I was playing until about two hours ago, yeah, sometimes.
[445:02.59]Don't run forward here.
[445:03.35]This is bad.
[445:03.77]There's a boss in here.
[445:12.96]It's the 1999 Zoomers.
[445:17.63]Are you a Zoomer if you're 1999?
[445:19.91]What's the cutoff here?
[445:20.57]I thought it was like 90... I thought it was like 97 or something.
[445:24.47]Like 96.
[445:25.89]What's the cutoff here?
[445:27.13]Yeah, it's 97, isn't it?
[445:37.40]96 is probably the cutoff point.
[445:43.22]You guys get such an interesting childhood.
[445:51.11]Think of all the stuff that's been developed in the last 15 years.
[445:53.67]I mean, we went from... I went from the regular Nintendo to cell phones.
[446:02.15]But the cell phones were kind of shitty.
[446:03.43]You know what I'm saying?
[446:06.35]We got iPhones.
[446:07.37]We got like... I was gonna say Google Stadia.
[446:12.39]But that would be... That's not a very good... That's not a very good thing to say for a tech... I don't know why I was gonna say Stadia.
[446:21.62]You know, we've got cell phones.
[446:22.64]We've got Stadia now.
[446:23.82]Like that's such a big deal.
[446:39.51]No, Google, this is a long play for Google, guys.
[446:41.49]I know Google makes a product and then pretends it doesn't exist like two years later.
[446:47.79]But really, I'm going to die.
[446:52.76]I'm fine.
[446:56.20]They are waiting for when the internet is a hundred times better than it is now.
[447:02.51]So they can be the first people that has the streaming video game console in 30 years.
[447:08.17]We've heard this before.
[447:09.07]We've heard you say this before.
[447:10.11]Yeah, but not everyone was here.
[447:11.09]This could be a completely different audience.
[447:17.60]Alright, this is it.
[447:28.80]Get everybody in here.
[447:31.43]Respawn everybody.
[447:34.09]Get up here.
[447:35.68]He ran into things to say.
[447:37.58]Listen, I never run into things to say.
[447:40.60]I can talk all day.
[447:53.35]We know, we know.
[447:56.56]Oh.
[448:02.50]You kind of ruined my thing.
[448:03.50]I was going to not talk for like five minutes.
[448:11.18]You spent an hour talking about expensive water.
[448:13.11]Expensive water.
[448:25.71]Sorry, the term is airport water.
[448:29.66]Airport water.
[448:30.46]Come on.
[448:32.49]What do you drink at the airport?
[448:34.17]Okay, watch out.
[448:40.66]Alright.
[448:41.52]Low and slow, low and slow, low and slow.
[448:45.33]Like a pot roast.
[449:06.80]Good.
[449:08.16]Oh man, there's so many people in here.
[449:10.44]Alright, I need more.
[449:12.86]Mano?
[449:18.91]Big mommy bug, that's right.
[449:22.07]Eggs everywhere and shit.
[449:23.15]This is why this place sucks.
[449:26.05]Ring?
[449:26.45]Come on, give me something better than that.
[449:31.12]If I didn't have all these people, can you imagine?
[449:33.00]This is solo, right?
[449:34.94]Imagine if 40 or 50 things were shooting at me at the same time.
[450:06.55]Alright, immune to cold and all of my mages are cold, so that's good.
[450:16.88]Done.
[450:20.68]Staff of Kings.
[450:23.85]I remember when I first played this game with friends a long time ago.
[450:27.85]I mean, it's not a terrible, very fast attack speed.
[450:33.53]It's two-handed, but I remember a friend of mine used this.
[450:35.83]They had this equipped for a very long time, and they didn't realize they were running around with this thing on, and I had to try to tell them that that's not what it is.
[450:48.02]You don't use this thing.
[450:49.22]It's part of a... The thing is, though, it's really pretty good.
[450:53.72]Look at how fast this swings.
[450:59.58]For a two-hander, that's really great.
[451:02.90]But they used it for a long time and they couldn't figure out how to get out of Act 2.
[451:14.32]Why not use it?
[451:15.08]Because you have to get rid of it to get out of Act 2.
[451:27.25]In quotes, his friend banned that person.
[451:29.92]The staff.
[451:36.62]Oh, let's make an amulet.
[451:47.89]That's funny that you can use it at all.
[451:48.93]You can use the hammer, too.
[451:50.45]From Act 1.
[451:58.56]Can we take a pee break?
[452:00.80]You can take a pee break when I level up again, because it'll be about five straight minutes of us picking stuff.
[452:06.34]So...
[452:08.60]You'll have that opportunity very soon.
[452:12.02]Cold Resist is more important than Magic Find right now, because Durial.
[452:14.74]59.
[452:17.02]Cold Resist.
[452:21.68]Alright, we're almost there.
[452:24.52]Almost to Durial.
[452:27.12]Please, I have to go so bad.
[452:28.34]Well, just go.
[452:29.51]It's okay.
[452:47.07]You guys are good.
[452:47.55]Alright, now we need the head.

[456:25.88]Thanks for the permission!
[456:33.88]Yes, excellent.
[456:41.73]It's taking a lot longer to kill things, though.
[456:43.77]That's starting to concern me a little.
[456:48.72]Just a little, getting a small amount of concern for how long it's taking me to kill anyone.
[457:03.85]You got two levels up?
[457:04.77]Yeah, yeah, yep, yep.
[457:08.37]Oh, there's an ancient tunnel here.
[457:09.83]That could be a chest.
[457:10.61]Who cares?
[457:10.99]Uh, can I go up?
[457:18.42]I can.
[457:27.08]Yes, this is still on hardcore.
[457:28.46]We've not given up on that one yet.
[457:32.16]Plus the price for a wink, it's 75,000 channel points.
[457:58.83]Alley of the snakes.
[458:00.13]Come on.
[458:03.89]I'm going to sneeze.
[458:04.99]Don't kill me by a trap.
[458:06.07]That would be... I'm going to sneeze.
[458:07.91]I can't pay attention.
[458:08.47]I'm going to sneeze.
[458:13.92]I promise that was real.
[458:18.50]Alright, where the hell am I?
[458:24.58]I don't have any antidotes.
[458:26.48]No.
[458:37.14]Kill something.

[458:50.69]Will somebody die?
[458:58.07]There was a wink?
[459:27.19]Thanks for the free wink.
[459:31.17]Yeah, you're welcome.
[459:33.90]I'm devaluing the winks by accidentally giving up free winks.
[459:40.14]That's not good.
[459:49.88]Alley the snakes.
[459:51.89]Come on.

[460:13.41]I W L I
[460:18.76]Y E 2 T I S M That's his Wi-Fi password.
[460:52.80]This DaVinci code shit.

[461:05.17]I need it.
[461:05.67]I need it.
[461:06.33]I need it.
[461:06.87]I need it.
[461:07.81]I need it.
[461:08.49]I need it.
[461:12.31]I want to filter some water and also review the filters on stream and then maybe pee in the filters.
[461:16.57]Not quite.
[461:17.39]Not really that close.
[461:19.64]Try again.
[461:31.99]And then maybe drink the filters.
[461:35.96]Where's this?
[461:36.36]I need a valley.
[461:38.38]I thought it was up here.
[461:39.02]I'm wrong.
[461:41.04]That was not it.
[461:41.54]Honestly, that was so long ago, I didn't even know what it was.
[461:51.00]I live my life in dog years, guys.
[461:55.39]Like one year is seven years for a dog.
[461:57.39]It's kind of the same way.
[461:58.23]Like one minute is like 45 minutes for me in my brain.
[462:23.25]Wait.
[462:24.35]Six sockets.
[462:24.95]Let's go.
[462:26.21]Actually, these sell for a lot.
[462:30.89]I can gamble.
[462:43.68]Valley of the snakes.
[462:47.38]Looking for valley of the snakes.
[462:49.66]Just want to find it.
[462:54.06]And I'd love to have stamina.
[462:57.81]Oh, God.
[462:59.25]Don't let this be the end.
[463:00.87]Don't let this be the end.
[463:01.69]Don't let this be the end.
[463:02.39]Don't let this be the end.
[463:11.70]Yeah, these self... Look at how much these self... Let's go gamble.
[463:38.83]Just tuned in is at the end.
[463:41.68]No, not yet.
[463:42.88]I'm still alright.
[463:43.76]I'm still chillin'.
[463:47.70]This stream has been chill enough where it's not like I'm exhausted right now.
[463:52.44]I still got my guy.
[463:58.51]Yeah, we'll level up, too.
[464:00.21]Let's do some gambling.
[464:02.40]Um, I need... What's the worst thing I have?
[464:04.10]I need boots.
[464:05.60]Boots and an offhand or something.
[464:06.80]Boots.
[464:07.36]These boots are so bad.
[464:08.46]These are from, like, level three.
[464:12.76]Level three boots.
[464:15.98]Come on.
[464:26.84]I could probably get a better weapon, too.
[464:35.85]Well, they're better.
[464:37.79]Not by very much, but they are.
[464:44.81]Ooh!
[464:54.64]Magic Find is crazy good in this game.
[464:58.64]Once you cross 1-200% Magic Find, Rares, Sets, and Uniques drop all the fucking time.
[465:09.49]I'll wear them.
[465:12.89]I'll put a bit of helm.
[465:14.09]Yeah.
[465:14.35]Try to get a helmet.
[465:20.17]Here we go.
[465:21.77]Two sockets.
[465:28.09]22, 25.
[465:28.87]Hold resist.
[465:36.36]I could put some stuff in there.
[465:37.40]There's two sockets in here.
[465:43.20]Do you want to try for something else?
[465:46.33]Maybe a weapon?
[465:46.79]This thing's level six.
[465:50.19]Oh, it's got to be one-handed.
[465:51.13]One-handed.
[466:10.96]Three to nineteen.
[466:19.26]What are you talking about?
[466:20.52]My job after streaming?
[466:22.08]What do you mean?
[466:22.70]I don't turn off the stream and go to work.
[466:26.71]What?
[466:28.11]Wait, what are you going to do?
[466:29.07]Is he going to go to his job today?
[466:39.21]He's not relatable.
[466:40.21]What do you mean I'm not relatable?
[466:49.32]12 alright no more alright that's it he's all suck last one terrible terrible let's go alright I got 10 points to put in where do you want me to put them take a look what we have so far remember strength is damage and gear dexterity is attack rating hit chance defense health stamina just mana that's all it does he got fired
[467:19.35]No, I've actually never been fired from a job in my life.
[467:24.15]This has never happened.
[467:24.77]Alright, what do you want to put?
[467:31.50]10 points.
[467:31.78]Take a look.
[467:33.16]Which one?
[467:33.38]You're going to get fired from streaming if I ping a filter on stream.
[467:44.82]So yeah, we'll make it one out of one.
[467:58.13]Alright, so it seems like now we're actively trying to fuck up the whole thing.
[468:01.21]Okay.
[468:01.45]I mean, this is... What do you guys want to do?
[468:12.36]What happened to engineering school?
[468:17.76]Uh... What are you talking about?
[468:25.13]Engineering school.
[468:27.63]Alright.
[468:27.79]Alright.
[468:32.79]Five, four, three, two, one.
[468:35.61]Dexterity it is.
[468:36.55]Ten points into dexterity.
[468:38.90]I might as well pick up a bow if you're going to do that shit.
[468:55.56]You're not having enough meltdown, so it all has to go into dex.
[469:01.32]Ay-yi-yi.
[469:03.00]Alright, take a look.
[469:03.48]This is what we got so far.
[469:04.12]Remember, blue means it's being... There's plus skills on it, so if you're like, what the fuck is that blue, dude?
[469:13.63]We have two points to spend.
[469:21.53]There are two points that we can spend.
[469:33.17]Don't want to influence the vote at all, but, you know, we have poison and bone.
[469:36.29]Here are the curses.
[469:37.05]You know where they are.
[469:37.71]Bone wall.
[469:44.61]Already has two points in it.
[469:48.98]Alright, where do you want to go?
[469:49.82]First point.
[469:52.04]Pick a category on the right.
[470:05.03]Bone wall.
[470:16.21]He already fucked up his decks?
[470:20.13]Yes, they did.
[470:20.59]Okay.
[470:31.48]Summoning.
[470:35.37]Which one?
[470:47.82]Hmm.
[470:55.72]Better skeletons.
[470:58.63]Hmm.
[471:01.41]Skeleton mastery?
[471:02.69]Is that where you guys are going?
[471:08.26]Okay.
[471:09.60]What about point number two?
[471:11.36]Please pick a category on the right if you want to pick a new one.
[471:14.04]You know, I'm sorry I just hit you in the mouth.
[471:17.05]Don't get mad at me.
[471:26.09]I guess you don't want to pick a category.
[471:27.61]Okay.
[471:33.02]Nobody wants to pick a new category.
[471:34.38]They want to stay right here.
[471:40.73]So we're going double skeleton mastery.
[471:42.27]Okay.
[471:56.32]Alright.
[472:00.61]I may have done it a little differently, you know, if it were me playing.
[472:03.62]If it were me playing.
[472:06.12]But, you know, going from, you know, increasing life and damage, let's say, for instance, 13 to 14 damage.
[472:12.84]Bang.
[472:14.36]16 to 17.
[472:15.82]Bang again.
[472:16.82]Skeleton Mastery again.
[472:17.96]19 to 20 damage.
[472:20.62]And they'll live longer, they'll have higher defense.
[472:22.51]I mean, it's not a terrible play, I don't think.
[472:25.97]This is the same build you were going to make anyways.
[472:31.46]Uh, no it is not.
[472:39.02]Some of this is all wrong.
[472:44.24]We don't know.
[472:45.16]We don't know.
[472:46.44]We don't know anything about the game.
[472:49.67]Okay.
[472:56.17]Cool.
[472:59.45]Tell us what you would like so we can avoid it.
[473:02.39]Well, I said Skeleton Mastery was better.
[473:04.93]And everybody clicked it.
[473:07.60]So... We want to have... Well, that's up to you.
[473:12.82]Okay.
[473:17.63]How do I... Potions are alright.
[473:19.13]Snakes.
[473:20.65]Snakes.
[473:25.49]Holy shit.
[473:26.47]What happened here?
[473:27.29]Oh, right, right, right, right.
[473:28.42]Okay.
[473:29.08]Yeah, I panicked and left.
[473:32.62]I forgot about this.
[473:51.51]Uh-oh.
[473:52.99]Heal him, heal him, heal him.
[473:55.29]You can drop a potion on companions and heal them.
[473:58.02]I just didn't do it to Kyle because I didn't care because he was like level 5.
[474:01.40]We were fighting like level 15 enemies so it was not even worth doing that.
[474:20.71]Still no valley.
[474:22.05]Is that a little spot up there?
[474:23.21]Did I miss a spot up here?
[474:26.60]Am I crazy?
[474:28.98]Damn it.
[474:38.24]Yep.
[474:38.38]It's actually probably right over here.
[474:55.17]You missed a spot.
[474:55.85]Alt-tab and turn off your computer.
[475:00.75]One of these days, somebody's going to say something like that, and I'm just going to do it.
[475:07.56]What?
[475:19.87]No skeletons are dying.
[475:24.65]Please, I'm stuck here.
[475:30.56]What happened?
[475:31.20]What do you mean you're stuck here?
[475:40.64]How is it possible to be stuck in that chair?
[475:45.98]Did you... Are you like... Are you like bare ass sitting on a wet piece of ice?
[475:54.61]what happened there it is there it is there it is found it found it found it found it yeah
[476:27.35]Yeah.
[476:29.01]I miss Frank.
[476:33.59]Yeah.
[476:48.82]We don't have any Dead Rising friends?
[476:51.96]How would... I just played that like a month or two ago.
[477:01.69]We don't have any Dead Rising friends.
[477:07.03]Friends?
[477:07.73]Is that what I said?
[477:08.31]I'm gonna beat Durgle first try.
[477:12.54]And then I'm gonna alt-tab my computer.
[477:38.04]I think this is a quick one, it's just right around level 2.
[477:41.76]Oh no.
[477:43.34]I feel the Arcane Sanctuary.
[477:49.22]Forgot, we can't just skip that part.
[477:55.73]Arcane Sanctuary is... so bad.
[478:13.99]Look at 5-3.
[478:14.37]Yeah, look at this.
[478:15.39]Look at how much these guys are staying alive now.
[478:17.41]There's so much beef here.
[478:20.58]Let's increase their potential by 40%.
[478:24.04]Overnight.
[478:27.92]Overnight.
[478:35.49]Easy.
[478:35.93]Alright, everyone get in there.
[478:38.75]Alright, here comes the battle.
[478:52.43]What's my hit chance on these guys?
[478:53.61]I'm curious.
[478:54.09]95.
[478:58.08]5%.
[478:58.20]Okay, that seems way higher than I thought it was.
[479:07.28]No level 2 in here.
[479:13.86]Bone mage gang?
[479:14.68]I think it's pretty much all bone.
[479:19.79]All bone gang.
[479:22.70]Not just mages.
[479:23.46]There's random skeletons.
[479:28.24]Tonight I'm going to sleep.
[479:29.76]Well, maybe we'll see tomorrow.
[479:33.78]Or the next day.
[479:34.46]Or whenever.
[479:36.08]Have a good sleep.
[479:41.11]Superior two-handed sword.
[479:42.17]Hold on.
[479:42.41]Eight to seventeen.
[479:45.45]Two sockets.
[479:46.15]Crash.
[479:47.95]+2 to weaken.
[479:49.13]No.
[479:49.23]Crash.
[479:49.43]Crash.
[480:00.33]In there.
[480:08.12]First, kill it.
[480:09.14]Worth using?
[480:11.96]No.
[480:28.15]It's probably right here.
[480:29.05]I always hate when it's right next to the door.
[480:43.84]I have to train them around.
[480:45.18]I'm gonna get stuck on somebody.
[480:58.78]Hmm... That could have ended very badly.
[481:09.57]Why do I hate gold?
[481:24.00]Um...
[481:27.78]No, ask him.
[481:30.12]Deflect him.
[481:39.12]These rooms have so many people in them.
[481:45.07]Get in!
[481:48.91]Get in!
[481:54.33]Why does your mouth taste like blood?
[481:56.90]Because you bit your lip?
[481:59.16]You're chewing too fast and you're trying to eat your food too quickly.
[482:03.22]Slow down.
[482:28.67]I drank from the 5G garden hose.
[482:42.41]Oh.
[482:47.88]Alright, level two is very quick.
[482:58.13]Right here.
[482:59.65]No, it's not.
[483:00.79]I thought it was right around the corner.
[483:02.05]It's not.
[483:09.13]How long is this stream going to be?
[483:14.62]I don't know.
[483:15.14]I don't know.
[483:16.56]Probably not that much longer, I don't think.
[483:18.18]Probably not much longer.
[483:23.55]But I got addicted to Diablo II.
[483:26.81]Which I kind of knew this was going to happen.
[483:41.96]Alright, let's go.
[483:42.90]Right to the end.
[483:43.42]Why is it not over here?
[483:47.18]Seems impossible.
[483:47.90]Let's try it on the... Again, see, look at this.
[483:54.13]Look at the RNG I'm getting here.
[483:57.19]It's in the one spot again that I didn't look.
[483:59.15]The one place.
[484:09.75]He's not going to be able to play D2 online with us.
[484:14.09]Um... Well, not with this character, but... I don't... Yeah.
[484:25.63]What does Vic have for armor?
[484:27.33]Actually, I don't think anything.
[484:29.00]Actually, nothing.
[484:31.66]So... Just here.
[484:33.38]Put this on.
[484:39.74]The skeletons are us.
[484:43.93]Yeah, think of it that way.
[484:49.81]I still seriously can't believe I got fucking banned from this game.
[484:53.25]I don't think I've ever been banned from my whole life.
[484:54.73]Alright, be careful here.
[484:57.10]This is danger.
[484:59.84]I've never been banned from a fucking video game, ever.
[485:02.00]I've never had any, like, problems.
[485:03.20]I got banned from Diablo II.
[485:05.22]Alright, okay.
[485:08.04]This is actually... Slow down.
[485:11.14]They can run up on you real quick.
[485:25.65]This place on a higher difficulty than normal is hell.
[485:30.25]It's so bad.
[485:30.87]I have been spawn camped in this room on hell.
[485:37.27]And had to restart the game like more than three or four times.
[485:54.13]Isn't this game hell, though?
[485:55.21]I mean, I have no idea.
[485:56.37]Can we level up?
[486:01.49]There he is.
[486:01.99]Fang skin.
[486:06.48]Hit.
[486:13.50]We have completed the staff.
[486:16.80]Here's the amulet.
[486:17.48]The Amulet of Kings.
[486:18.14]10 life, 10 mana, poison resistant.
[486:21.33]Thought we were going to turn into the staff anyways.
[486:27.45]Time to die.
[486:27.89]Die.
[486:28.03]Time to die.
[486:32.22]Die.
[486:32.30]How do I do that?
[486:32.70]What is it again?
[486:44.58]Time to die.
[486:45.84]Time to die.
[486:47.16]Die.
[486:48.36]Time to die.
[486:49.78]Goodbye.
[486:51.18]Where's- Help!
[486:52.86]Help me!
[486:54.26]Help!
[486:55.24]Help me!
[486:56.14]Forgive me.
[486:57.46]Come on.
[486:58.36]Thanks.
[486:59.37]This is for you.
[487:00.67]Where is it?
[487:01.21]Run!
[487:04.05]Thanks.
[487:05.33]Help!
[487:05.87]There it is.
[487:06.37]Help!
[487:07.19]Help me!
[487:08.47]Help me!
[487:09.61]Help!
[487:11.59]Follow me.
[487:12.63]Help me!
[487:23.32]I know all the voice lines from Samurai Warriors 2 Empires.
[487:31.47]Alright.
[487:34.15]Here we go.
[487:42.28]The Haradric Staff...
[487:45.02]I can now go to the passel.
[487:47.06]The passel?
[487:47.62]The palace castle.
[487:49.60]Oy.
[488:13.32]Let's get some, uh, actual armor and weapons for this guy.
[488:18.76]How about a trident?
[488:21.01]Trident?
[488:21.55]Yeah.
[488:24.01]And a, uh, regular shitty helmet.
[488:27.75]And, uh, that's fine.
[488:32.55]3096, that's pretty good, actually.
[488:34.11]We're gonna talk to, uh, Frogman.
[488:48.19]Potions are fine.
[488:53.03]Is Path of Exile similar to this?
[488:55.81]I would say very.
[488:58.82]The Path of Exile is a little newer.
[489:00.26]This is pretty dated.
[489:03.38]Still does very, very well.
[489:05.04]Still holds up very well.
[489:06.04]Somebody said they bet 50 channel points that I die to the Arcane Dudes.
[489:18.81]Only 50?
[489:18.93]Yeah, I'm going to go to the Summoner.
[489:20.21]Find a stupid... I hate this part.
[489:21.09]Look for the Arcane Sanctuary within the palace.
[489:22.45]I do have a lot of friends, though.
[489:54.98]Goodbye.
[489:55.44]Get the staff into Tal Rasha's tomb, find Tal Rasha's tomb.
[489:57.87]Here we go.
[489:58.67]Who do you hate more, Vinny or Joel?
[490:26.60]You know you just love when you get RNG like this one.
[490:28.26]Level 2, let's go.
[490:42.95]Uh, why do I have to hate someone?
[490:46.77]Is there a reason why I have to hate someone?
[490:52.69]This is the part of the game where I become kind of useless.
[490:54.51]I'm not going to be able to hurt anything.
[490:56.11]I don't have any moves.
[491:00.89]But I do have friends that can hurt for me.
[491:09.31]Where is it?
[491:09.67]Down here?
[491:22.40]It's like the Red Dead stream when you just showed up.
[491:24.38]Yeah, that was funny.
[491:26.24]There it is again.
[491:26.94]Nice.
[491:29.24]Quickly doing this.
[491:30.90]Good, because Arcane Sanctuary is a pain in the ass, so I'm glad to get this out of the way.
[491:45.93]I need one more mage.
[491:46.75]I'll block.
[491:52.96]The whole team is here now.
[491:59.57]Oh, Vinny is here.
[492:01.85]I wish that Red Dead stream worked better, but it's always good to play games with you, Jermo.
[492:05.01]What's going on, Vinny?
[492:09.39]Good to see you.
[492:11.77]Look at this.
[492:12.21]We're getting such good random rolls.
[492:21.19]Vinny, I'd love to play Diablo II with you, but I'm not sure if you're here, but I've been shadow banned from Diablo II for a reason I can't figure out why.
[492:37.10]I have to buy... I have to have a new account.
[492:42.23]It's weird.
[492:42.57]I don't know.
[492:43.49]Who knows?
[492:52.56]Yeah, I went off on it.
[493:00.85]I talked a little bit about Blizzard earlier.
[493:04.95]But if I actually got banned for trying to get the game to run... Like... Get out of here.
[493:16.68]Nope.
[493:16.82]Don't want to go that way.
[493:22.41]I'm so starved of stamina, so bad.
[493:31.83]I streamed this last year and I still love it.
[493:33.19]I was not banned, however.
[493:35.14]I'm glad to hear you weren't banned.
[493:36.74]I don't know, maybe it's sort of like... I don't think if I ever... I don't think it's... I usually play this game once every couple years.
[493:49.34]Once every two or three years, I'll just turn this on and do Act 1 and then uninstall it.
[493:53.52]It happens like every couple years.
[493:56.46]I don't think there's ever a time where I was like, you know what, I'm going to install level 99 cheats.
[494:00.66]I don't think so.
[494:11.95]It's just kind of what you do with this game.
[494:18.40]If anyone's been keeping track, I think that's like the 12th or 15th composite rare bow in a row.
[494:26.02]Can I get anything else?
[494:29.18]That'd be happening.
[494:39.10]Act 1 is the ugliest environment.
[494:42.49]I would say Act 3 is probably uglier than Act 1.
[494:46.26]Factory has a couple of places that have just... And they spread out weirdly.
[494:50.51]Come on, sir.
[494:52.09]Alright, speedrun time.
[495:01.83]Let's go.
[495:04.53]This better not kill me.
[495:05.15]This better not kill me.
[495:05.71]This better not kill me.
[495:06.27]This better not kill me.
[495:08.95]I'm okay.
[495:09.87]Don't open that door.
[495:10.55]Don't open that door.
[495:11.29]Vic, don't open that door.
[495:11.97]Look at how smart you are.
[495:15.91]I'm so glad that you're smarter than the pizza.
[495:18.35]Because the pizza just opens every single door.
[495:20.05]Alright, I'll open the door now.
[495:29.04]Now that we're all here.
[495:31.16]Can I even open this door?
[495:33.80]No, you can't even open this door.
[495:36.74]Wait, yes you can.
[495:37.46]What?
[495:42.96]I couldn't do it before.
[495:49.26]This is not a... This is a mistake to do.
[495:51.56]I found it.
[495:51.92]It's right there.
[495:52.26]It's right there.
[495:53.36]Okay, I gotta go up and then left.
[495:54.97]Make sure you have stamina for this shit.
[496:01.47]Ah, almost got it.
[496:03.29]You almost got it.
[496:04.23]That was close.
[496:08.07]That was real close.
[496:24.41]Alright, get in.
[496:26.93]On our way to the Arcane Sanctuary.
[496:31.94]I hope I don't die here.
[496:33.32]You know, if I wanted to, I could just completely game this stream.
[496:44.65]And I could turn the stream off whenever I want.
[496:48.29]Oh, shit, I died in Arcane Sanctuary.
[496:50.11]Well, hardcore.
[496:51.43]See, that's it.
[496:52.17]See you later.
[496:56.32]I'm not gonna do that, though.
[497:06.19]Holy fuck, there's so many people in here.
[497:18.12]Just going, just going.
[497:22.52]It's right here.
[497:27.16]Arcane sanctuary here we go find the journal I wish I had time to study this bizarre dimension
[497:34.44]So if you don't know about Arcane Sanctuary, how this place works is you have four directions.
[497:40.36]Usually you play this with four people or at least four or five people.
[497:42.92]Sometimes if you have eight, that's great because you go in groups of two.
[497:47.56]It sucks, but because I'm alone, I can do it in groups of one.
[497:52.37]And you pick a direction and you go all the way.
[497:54.49]It takes about 15 to 20 plus minutes per direction.
[497:58.45]And you might hit a dead end and only one of them is corrected.
[498:05.17]Which way do I go?
[498:07.27]This way.
[498:19.02]And now we wait.
[498:26.83]Let us vote.
[498:27.43]What the fuck?
[498:28.13]Chat picks everything.
[498:29.21]What the fuck?
[498:30.97]It's all good.
[498:33.43]You would have picked this way anyways.
[498:34.85]Ooh.
[498:37.43]What?
[498:38.91]Am I overburdened?
[498:42.65]But I am.
[498:43.07]I gotta go back to town.
[498:52.80]Uh... Can't do that for free, Jeremy.
[498:55.90]What the fuck are you doing?
[499:02.69]Not a bad helmet.
[499:03.17]One of the decks is already terrible.
[499:05.18]Four to mana.
[499:05.66]Get out of here.
[499:06.06]I need mana potions.
[499:08.74]Eh.
[499:09.64]Okay, I don't.
[499:15.04]Trimmer is ignoring his viewers.
[499:21.29]Did you put the cube in your stash?
[499:25.83]Yeah, what?
[499:29.11]What?
[499:30.41]I don't like it in here.
[499:34.06]I don't like the way it looks in here.
[499:45.05]Free inventory space.
[499:46.05]I know.
[499:47.05]But... I don't like it in here.
[499:53.79]I remember back in the day... Perfect skulls went for a lot.
[499:59.31]Oops.
[500:00.69]Let's do some stats.
[500:07.06]Alright.
[500:08.72]You can see what we have so far.
[500:09.84]Five points going in what?
[500:10.80]Please decide.
[500:11.68]Yeah, perfect skulls.
[500:14.90]If you had 20, 30 perfect skulls, they were pretty good currency.
[500:18.18]Yeah, I'll show you the bones.
[500:31.41]I remember when FDR was president.
[500:43.84]Alright, vitality.
[500:49.04]Good choice.
[500:52.36]Now we also need a skill point here, so... Have we unlocked anything new?
[501:03.81]Not yet, no.
[501:05.13]Same deal.
[501:07.71]We're almost at 10 points in raised skeleton.
[501:11.66]A bunch of random points in Blood Golem and Golem Mastery.
[501:14.56]Just to give you a look.
[501:28.53]And we are actually, we're going to kill Durial and I'm going to turn off the stream.
[501:37.00]It's going to be over after that.
[501:44.48]So, well, we're at eight and a half hours.
[501:54.80]It's a long time.
[501:58.33]I'm not aiming for another 13-hour stream today.
[502:02.03]Alright, we're in the same category.
[502:08.93]What do you want?
[502:23.99]What are you guys doing?
[502:29.53]What are you guys doing?
[502:36.45]Guys?

[503:25.29]You guys already picked the category.
[503:30.37]What is happening right now?
[503:39.60]We want to change category.
[503:45.40]It's broken?
[503:46.12]There are 320 votes so far.
[504:00.01]We want different category.
[504:02.54]We want new category, different category, different cat.
[504:05.32]Well, you picked it already.
[504:13.59]No new category.
[504:15.07]Now we want, we want blood.
[504:25.79]I'm going to give you guys one more chance.
[504:27.48]If you really want to change categories, it's your only opportunity.
[504:29.86]Otherwise, I'm picking something.
[504:37.03]Alright, fine.

[505:32.87]We're already in summoning spells.
[505:49.54]Someone else is doing this.
[505:53.26]He doesn't know.
[505:54.56]What would I know?
[505:55.23]No, this isn't bots.
[505:59.13]Bots wouldn't do this.
[506:06.59]Okay.
[506:08.75]Alright.
[506:09.13]Alright.
[506:09.37]That's it.

[506:48.02]Nice work.
[506:50.44]It only took you six straight minutes to figure that out.
[506:58.54]I need two more points to get another mage to get to four.
[507:06.09]Trying to artificially inflate, you know, how long the stream is.
[507:08.91]I see, I know what you guys are doing.
[507:14.52]Back to the sanctuary.
[507:15.36]Am I gonna play this again?
[507:31.35]I'll be honest, I didn't think this was going to last this long.
[507:33.21]So, I mean, I... I'm still alive.
[507:51.20]I'm still alive.
[507:52.80]Although I can probably give that... 60.
[507:55.02]Alright, yeah, I'm going to give this to... Nice.
[508:00.25]Good.
[508:03.23]Alright, let's get lucky here and have this be the right one the first try.
[508:07.76]Why are you doing the TP's?
[508:08.68]What's going on with the TP?
[508:21.49]All I can do is sit back here and just cast Amplified Damage and just wait for them to die.
[508:26.13]Karma's TP looks like an Ender Dragon.
[508:38.56]I don't see it.
[508:39.02]I don't see it.
[508:43.77]In fact, I actually don't really know what an ender dragon looks like.
[508:50.09]Five skeletons, there's four.
[508:56.06]What does the ender dragon look like?
[508:59.76]I feel like I know what it looks like, but I don't at the same time.
[509:12.26]Arcane Sanctuary is also a place you cannot just run through.
[509:14.86]I wish it weren't the case, but you have to actually play this because the corridors are three squares wide.
[509:32.17]And we find the correct tomb of Tal Rasha.
[509:34.81]And then we kill Duriel.
[509:37.06]And turn the stream off.
[509:59.41]I'm just here to watch you die to Durial.
[510:02.79]Well, that would be a long nine hours, wouldn't it?
[510:04.77]I could just die to Durial.
[510:10.68]He sucks, though.
[510:13.28]Durial sucks.
[510:14.64]It's just a tiny little area.
[510:19.17]I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.
[510:20.15]You know, I'm going to have to go in.
[510:21.57]And here's the plan.
[510:23.59]The plan is bring an absolute shitload amount of mana potions into the dungeon.
[510:30.44]And have Durial just fight my Blood Golem.
[510:34.82]It's going to take like 30 minutes to kill him.
[510:36.98]But that's the only thing I can do.
[510:51.36]You're really supposed to one-hit kill you.
[510:52.74]No, he's not.
[510:53.16]Look, I have 49 cold resist.
[510:56.18]I'll just stack it.
[510:57.20]Yeah, I'll just boneball myself into a corner.
[511:04.03]And let the blood golem... Just keep respawning the blood golem with like 100 potions.
[511:07.23]I'm going to fill every slot in my inventory with potions.
[511:16.56]Stop pretending this isn't hard.
[511:20.60]What did I do wrong?
[511:22.44]I'm playing a summoning necromancer.
[511:24.54]What are you talking about?
[511:28.00]What more am I supposed to do right now?
[511:31.20]What more am I supposed to do right now?
[511:33.42]I have just a bunch of people.
[511:35.36]I can't do anything.
[511:52.01]Corpse Explosion is a summoning build.
[511:58.25]I just... I don't have it.
[512:07.96]This is all I have.
[512:08.86]This is all I have to work with.
[512:18.10]I mean, it wouldn't be Chat Picks Everything if I go, you know, let me sneak a corpse explosion in here.
[512:22.22]That sounds good.
[512:24.84]I got lucky.
[512:25.26]I actually just got lucky.
[512:28.04]First try.
[512:37.17]Get him.
[512:40.11]Get up the stairs and get him.
[512:42.55]Alright, this is Pinwheel.
[512:43.55]If I die to the summer, that's literally dying to Pinwheel.
[513:01.56]Kill him!
[513:02.18]Somebody hit him with anything.
[513:03.19]Alright, we're good.
[513:11.31]Oops, I just skipped everything.
[513:12.35]Alright, we did it.
[513:15.31]Canyon of the Magi.
[513:16.58]That didn't take 20 minutes.
[513:18.32]Because I got really lucky.
[513:19.92]I didn't have to go through all the portal shit.
[513:25.70]You don't know how annoying that could possibly have been.
[513:31.45]Did you know that the Summoner is the mage from Diablo 1?
[513:34.95]Yeah.
[513:36.87]Free skill?
[513:39.33]No.
[513:39.59]I already got it with Radim and Slayer.
[513:50.48]The reason why you have to go through all that is because there are a bunch of dungeons that all have symbols in front of them.
[513:55.96]And this is the correct symbol.
[513:57.48]It's the only one that has burial in it.
[514:02.52]Can't wait.
[514:03.54]I really hope I don't die here.
[514:04.44]It would be a nine hour fucking stream to just die to the Act 2 boss.
[514:11.05]This is why hardcore sucks.
[514:20.07]Alright, do I have any... Okay.
[514:20.79]24 health and a helmet?
[514:39.48]Cold Resist?
[514:40.12]I don't have a shield.
[514:45.49]What do I have right now for Cold Resist?
[514:47.29]49.
[514:47.31]That's not bad.
[514:48.45]Normal.
[514:48.73]That's okay.
[514:53.45]Let's go.
[514:56.85]But I played Diablo 1.
[514:59.41]Diablo 1 doesn't hold up for me like Diablo II does.
[515:01.80]It's still a good game.
[515:06.26]But I can replay Diablo II many times.
[515:10.96]Make sure you bring the staff.
[515:15.39]Yep, I got it.
[515:18.95]Uh, what do I put in here?
[515:19.81]I'm just gonna put health in there.
[515:23.21]Fuck it.
[515:23.73]I'll get more rubies.
[515:24.41]Okay, I did it.
[515:25.53]It's already done.
[515:32.87]Okay, now I need... A shitload of mana potions.
[515:54.03]Why can't you pop in this game and don't you lose all your items?
[516:05.59]I remember people used to do that.
[516:06.87]That was a scam that existed back in the day.
[516:09.50]It was, oh man, let me show you how to dupe.
[516:13.03]They said if you put the items that you wanted on your character and you filled your body with potions like three times and died... Yeah, and eventually if you die like three times with a full belt, full potions and everything and no slots for anything, your character popped and all your items landed on the ground.
[516:30.92]There was a lot of Diablo scams.
[516:33.40]Another scam in particular was the switcheroo.
[516:36.86]So there's only, I think, three or four different pieces of art for Diablo II's rings and amulets and weapons and swords and stuff.
[516:43.64]So what would happen is somebody would... You had to check a box.
[516:48.39]And that other person had to check a box.
[516:51.77]to be able to have a transaction go through you, both at a trade window.
[516:55.25]And somebody, let's say this was the Stone of Jordan, one of the most sought-after rings in the whole game.
[516:59.06]And it would have this art, because they all have the same art.
[517:03.70]They'd put it in.
[517:04.36]Yeah, I want, uh, two worm skulls.
[517:07.98]And you're like, okay, yeah, sure, here's my worm skull, here it is.
[517:10.98]And then you, I would check the box, and they would go, oh, hold on a second!
[517:15.38]I, uh, I need some inventory space!
[517:17.80]And they would go back and they'd do this bullshit, they'd walk over and pretend to go to the fucking stash.
[517:23.47]then they come back and they say okay hey and they go put it in the window check the box and then you would put your thing in the window check the box and it was like oh no oh and it was one of these and this worked all the time why would you trade I don't know because you don't you don't it's a scam
[517:53.89]That's like saying, oh, hey, dude, when Microsoft calls you and tells you that the IRS is looking for $50 in iTunes gift cards, why do you do that?
[518:03.28]The scams work, man.
[518:13.48]This is how he was banned.
[518:14.74]No, this is shit that happened like 20 years ago.
[518:17.70]I didn't do this shit.
[518:18.78]It happened to me once.
[518:21.34]I was like fucking 14.
[518:28.80]I got scammed out of a pre-patch worm skull.
[518:31.11]I told you guys that.
[518:31.85]That thing was worth a shitload.
[518:33.71]And I remember just DMing this person over and over again, telling them that my brother gave it to me.
[518:38.67]That was a gift from my brother.
[518:45.61]I got scammed.
[518:46.29]Yeah, it was horrible.
[518:49.23]And I said, like, me and my brother don't talk anymore.
[518:51.07]And that was, like, one of the things that me and my brother did.
[518:53.48]And we love Diablo.
[518:54.38]We don't talk anymore.
[518:55.18]And sometimes he logs on and, like, we play.
[518:58.64]And that's his worm skull.
[519:00.28]And the guy was like, fuck off.
[519:08.38]I mean, what I was saying was total horseshit.
[519:10.52]But still.
[519:11.96]What a dick.
[519:21.29]I'm not even sure there was a report button in the game, guys.
[519:24.89]See, nowadays, when you play, like, League of Legends and somebody tells you to, like, to go, like... Ah, fuck you, buddy.
[519:30.31]You, like, report.
[519:31.61]And somebody sees it.
[519:34.76]And then that person gets a... I don't think that even was possible.
[519:41.48]You could do the ring scam a hundred times and it was just like, ah, that's the ring scam guy.
[519:45.48]There he is.
[519:47.12]He joined another server.
[519:54.93]I think you actually had to email support.
[519:58.67]But I think there was a thing that said, like, you're not gonna get your items back.
[520:02.65]Uh, be careful.
[520:03.41]It worked, though.
[520:11.88]Alright, what was I doing?
[520:13.10]This.
[520:14.72]Prepare.
[520:15.92]Let's go kill Durial, and then we'll turn off the stream.
[520:21.37]I'm ready.
[520:22.59]What's the symbol look like again?
[520:25.12]Circle with the smiley underneath.
[520:26.48]Okay.
[520:29.38]Alright, I hit the waypoint.
[520:30.10]I hit the waypoint.
[520:39.62]What the hell am I over here?
[520:43.42]He doesn't need a ring?
[520:45.18]He needs another ring.
[520:52.25]Alright, is it weird that I don't give a shit because that ring is like plus one to maximum damage or something?
[521:00.35]I'll find a better one.
[521:01.89]Probably right now.
[521:08.92]We aren't fighting anything.
[521:09.72]Let's go.
[521:11.46]I know the symbol.
[521:24.59]Not the one.
[521:25.11]There's a circle above it.
[521:34.76]Not the one.
[521:41.14]Why do you keep ignoring gold?
[521:42.96]Because once you get to Act 4, Act 5, the gold is meaningless in this game.
[521:53.70]Once you get to, like, Nightmare Act 1, gold has no value.
[522:03.51]Don't die to this.
[522:05.11]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[522:07.83]Important.
[522:09.69]I gotta... Okay, we need some skeletons and shit.
[522:22.20]I almost just walked in here with nothing.
[522:23.54]That would have been horrible.
[522:31.02]Alright, you leveled up.
[522:32.44]Good for you.
[522:46.01]Don't run out of st- oh, there's a well.
[522:47.79]Frank, run the well.
[522:55.66]Uh, wrong.
[522:57.48]Is there one more down here?
[522:58.28]I don't think so.
[522:59.10]Yes, there is.
[523:00.56]Wrong.
[523:08.14]Wrong.
[523:09.68]Right.
[523:12.12]There it is.
[523:20.99]Boss time.
[523:29.39]Because this is a pretty big apex of the stream here, I don't know how many people have any confidence in me beating this.
[523:35.99]Let's see.
[523:38.83]Am I going to beat Durial?
[523:49.96]I'm actually curious.
[524:03.43]Yes, yes, yeah.
[524:04.23]Alright, actually, we're getting a lot of yeses.
[524:14.82]No more levels up?
[524:16.30]Oh boy, easy.
[524:20.52]75%, alright.
[524:22.16]Thanks for the confidence boost.
[524:27.94]It's going to be very boring, and you'll beat him and pretend it's hype.
[524:32.48]Oh, I turned off hype trains, by the way.
[524:33.97]You're probably noticing why you haven't seen one.
[524:36.23]I turned it off.
[524:43.51]They don't exist anymore, right?
[524:48.49]I turned mine off, too.
[524:49.61]Yeah, I just...
[524:56.99]This is going to be incredibly disappointing if he loses.
[524:59.39]Um... Yes, it will be, because that would be nine hours of a total waste of fucking time.
[525:06.14]Because I can't log on to this character again.
[525:08.04]Alright, let me in.
[525:27.45]What are you going to put in that wallet now?
[525:29.13]What do you mean?
[525:29.49]Because I turned off hype trains?
[525:45.00]It's a... This is a tricky zone.
[525:48.34]It's an interesting idea.
[525:50.86]It's just... Even when you put it hard to do, it still happens.
[525:58.62]It's sort of just... Game of... Focus on the game.
[526:12.31]Alright.
[526:12.97]Alright, alright.
[526:13.65]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[526:14.85]We're gonna have to do that.
[526:17.99]We're gonna have to focus on the game.
[526:19.79]Otherwise, I'm gonna die.
[526:21.13]If we're getting to even to the... Holy shit!
[526:23.57]Holy shit!
[526:24.39]Holy shit!
[526:27.05]Ring mail!
[526:41.25]That's a couple of greens.
[526:48.12]Is this Arctic?
[526:49.32]Arctic?
[526:51.60]Oh, it's angelic.
[526:54.62]Oh, these little normal difficulty shitty sets.
[527:00.03]Nah, I'll give it to you.
[527:01.51]Better than what you have on.
[527:18.90]Too bad.
[527:26.15]Oh, scary room.
[527:28.47]Scary room.
[527:29.19]No, no, Vic!
[527:30.67]He's dead.
[527:32.43]What the fuck is even in here doing that?
[527:37.53]What the hell is in here?
[527:43.58]Nothing.
[527:43.90]Nothing.
[527:45.77]Nothing.
[527:46.03]A whole lot of nothing.
[527:47.59]I'll get him back before I do Daryl, don't worry.
[527:49.01]I'm gonna keep him alive.
[528:03.14]Looking for bail.
[528:07.40]Looking for bail.
[528:08.80]Looking for bail.
[528:18.00]You're going to die to a chest trap.
[528:20.18]You probably... That's why I'm not kicking over any chests.
[528:25.70]Because that's bad.
[528:28.02]I don't want to die to a chest trap.
[528:30.80]Ow.
[528:31.02]Oh, right.
[528:32.80]I kind of feel naked without Vic.
[528:43.39]That aura was actually pretty key.
[528:48.05]Alright, everybody get in here.
[528:52.99]Oh, oh, oh my God.
[528:54.03]Oh my God.
[528:58.69]It's itching my eye.
[529:08.83]Hardcore is horror, especially in Act 2.
[529:10.43]Because Act 2's light radius sucks.
[529:15.29]So you'll just open up one of these doors and there's 40 people standing behind it just waiting to kill you.
[529:21.63]And half of them shoot lightning out of their ass.
[529:24.25]That's fun.
[529:28.55]Act 3's not going to be any better.
[529:31.27]No, it won't.
[529:43.44]We're doing alright.
[529:44.26]I think it's safe to get in here now.
[529:47.60]And go for a kill myself.
[530:00.09]Nothing?
[530:00.43]Anything drop?
[530:01.11]Anything good?
[530:02.35]Can't carry anymore anyways.
[530:04.53]Bone one.
[530:05.17]Let's take a look.
[530:11.08]Uh...
[530:17.87]Wanted teeth.
[530:18.51]Teeth.
[530:19.91]Get the fuck off.
[530:21.53]Claws.
[530:21.71]I have to go back to... Stay back.
[530:48.40]When they die, replace them.
[530:49.38]Number five.
[530:51.02]Good number.
[530:59.96]Looking for a room within... There's an orifice.
[531:02.34]Probably not this way, but let's go.
[531:20.19]Why are all the mages dying?
[531:30.26]Fuck, this room's so bad.
[531:36.98]Jesus.
[531:43.04]I can't even walk in here.
[531:59.49]How did you get back?
[532:00.09]Where are they coming from?
[532:01.17]Where are they coming from?
[532:02.91]Back to town.
[532:05.09]Back to town.
[532:14.62]Tell this shit.
[532:26.70]more mana potions equip the ring it's not whatever alright let's go get our buddy back
[533:03.92]$3,000 to bring you back.
[533:04.56]Come on.
[533:05.00]Stay alive.
[533:05.36]Alright.
[533:12.32]Vic being here now, we're going to be doing just fine.
[533:15.82]Everybody get in here.
[533:16.66]Go in.
[533:16.92]Go.
[533:20.49]Jeez.
[533:22.59]Okay.
[533:24.73]How's everybody doing?
[533:26.59]Go party.
[533:27.49]Go party.
[533:32.53]I gotta keep an eye on Vic's health, because he's probably the most important person here.
[533:37.19]You see this?
[533:39.16]Vic shows up, and he just instant kills four people.
[533:46.18]Another wink?
[533:47.29]What?
[534:00.77]Another stupid room where we just stuff in.
[534:05.68]Vic, get in there.
[534:07.34]You're the only person here worth anything.
[534:09.30]Alright, I'm gonna get in there now.
[534:28.70]I'm gonna go snipe the guy back here.
[534:38.99]Where am I going?
[534:39.61]Probably to the right.
[534:48.21]Let's go.
[534:51.15]Come on.
[534:52.21]We're almost there.
[534:55.28]Can't get lazy on hardcore either.
[535:06.78]As long as Vic is in there.
[535:07.74]Fake wink?
[535:15.59]Yeah, I can see the channel points.
[535:22.91]I'm going in.
[535:25.16]3, 2, 1, go.
[535:30.72]Good?
[535:31.44]Yes, we are.
[535:32.14]Hang a right.
[535:37.28]Stay with me.
[535:37.86]Don't attack the one person over there.
[535:39.68]Don't be idiots.
[535:48.84]I got him.
[535:51.20]Stay back.
[535:59.37]I'm just replenishing.
[536:07.06]Looking good.
[536:07.60]See, this is summoning Necro right here.
[536:10.48]This is what it's all about.
[536:12.54]You just don't do anything.
[536:18.55]Well, if you're in a party with a summoning Necro, it's great.
[536:24.61]Because all the minions just eat every hit.
[536:28.51]And you're just free to smash on people.
[536:47.52]Poison Nova Necro is fun too, yeah.
[536:51.14]Because you just run in a room, right click, and then run away.
[536:54.22]And just let everything die.
[536:57.85]You have to do every synergy though, or you're useless in hell.
[537:04.27]I can sell this.
[537:13.62]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[537:15.98]Vic?
[537:34.48]I have to sit on still 4.
[537:36.04]He's leveled up.
[537:42.87]Maybe the spear's better.
[537:48.07]2 to 24.
[537:52.67]No.
[537:53.23]Hold resist, though.
[537:56.77]Here.
[537:56.93]Is this better than... 32 to 92?
[537:59.98]That's better.
[538:05.15]yeah alright well I'm gonna check just check over here just I want to look it might be right here oh god damn this place is huge place is enormous
[538:37.49]Too many people Sweat check?
[538:42.41]Not really
[539:17.81]This game is a goddamn mess.
[539:30.02]Eyes and hearts.
[539:32.22]Another shitty one.
[539:34.92]Eyes and hearts case.
[539:36.66]107.
[539:38.02]With magic damage reduced by 2.
[539:40.46]Unless you get it.
[539:41.59]This is bad.
[539:42.05]What do you have on?
[539:48.18]I mean, this is just better.
[539:48.96]Waste Tal Rasha's?
[539:54.23]You don't get that till, like, Nightmare.
[540:05.89]Or Hell.
[540:06.25]I think that only dropped from Hell.
[540:11.26]Balloon's going down.
[540:16.84]get to level up one more time before durial be nice lod improves the game significantly yes it does at this point I think that I'm not sure I'd want to play just regular Diablo II without lod it's just too much better too much too many improvements
[540:44.95]So many more items.
[540:46.73]So many more runes.
[540:49.71]As much as the charm system is kind of dumb, it's still there and it's kind of interesting to find stuff that works for your character.
[540:55.87]Can this be a yearly thing?
[541:10.02]Um...
[541:22.99]I love this game so it's not gonna take very much to convince me to play it I just want to see if it was possible for me to get into the first because you guys know I'm not I don't play games like hardcore I play them just kind of to do them don't go down that high by yourself what are you thinking
[541:49.94]I'm about to make a full circle line, I think.
[541:59.99]Here comes the full circle.
[542:08.01]Pick is doing work, yeah.
[542:30.44]We're still alive.
[542:31.14]We're okay.
[542:35.68]Sneak around.
[542:38.54]Don't go too far.
[542:46.75]Where am I?
[542:47.39]23?
[542:47.43]This is exactly where I wanted to be for Durial.
[542:51.27]Right about 24, 25 is when you should be kind of going through...
[542:55.56]I would say Act 3, you really want to... What would you guys say?
[542:58.66]Does it get played in 25, 30 for Act 3?
[542:59.78]Something like that?
[543:09.65]I've got to be close.
[543:10.52]This is getting ridiculous.
[543:11.62]Come on.
[543:11.90]How big is this?
[543:16.18]This build puts us at about level 50.
[543:21.34]Well, I mean, there are points in Bonewall.
[543:24.25]And there's a point in Teeth, a point in Bonewall.
[543:27.65]Don't even check yet.
[543:31.03]What else is there?
[543:31.63]Points in Blood Golem?
[543:35.13]Golem Mastery?
[543:36.30]There's at least five points here that are not being utilized well.
[543:40.06]You guys can think about what the hell you want to do.
[543:54.84]Those are well-spent points.
[543:59.32]We can agree to disagree on that.
[544:11.63]What about a snow golem?
[544:14.31]I don't think they exist, but that would be cool.
[544:17.13]An ice golem?
[544:25.36]As someone who lives and breathes this game, this is painful.
[544:29.78]This is what happens when you give 5,000 people or 6,000 people earlier the power to choose a character in World of Warcraft.
[544:48.09]Wrong franchise!
[544:53.19]We're down 4k now.
[544:54.74]Yes, we are.
[544:55.86]It's also midnight Pacific.
[544:56.68]It's also very, very late.
[544:58.92]I'm actually surprised this many people are still here.
[545:04.48]So, thanks for sticking around.
[545:06.94]Hope you like it.
[545:08.36]I'm having fun.
[545:08.88]Alright, there's only one place.
[545:13.60]Again, look what happened.
[545:17.38]Every single place uncovered except the one spot where it is.
[545:20.29]Again, it happened again.
[545:29.88]Please don't beat the boss.
[545:34.26]I'm done after this.
[545:37.66]There it is.
[545:37.94]There it is.
[545:38.22]There it is.
[545:38.52]There it is.
[545:38.80]Don't get stuck.
[545:43.87]E, U, A. No, I'm done after this.
[545:49.33]Whatever happens here, this is the end of the stream.
[545:51.85]I'm either going to die to Durial or we're going to have beaten Act 2 and we can keep going another time probably.
[546:00.44]I really hope I don't die though.
[546:01.47]Cause this would be, that would be sad.
[546:03.13]It's not even here.
[546:21.74]What is tomorrow's stream going to be?
[546:23.04]Well, I got to talk to Joel.
[546:26.66]Because I know he said that he wanted to keep talking.
[546:29.95]But he couldn't do it today.
[546:31.21]So we're either going to do that tomorrow or the next day.
[546:34.15]Let me stop for a second and get you my breath.
[546:51.89]Where's the one place I didn't go?
[546:55.33]Where the hell is it?
[546:59.23]Top left?
[547:01.55]Shit.
[547:07.01]Do I know about the dupe glitch?
[547:08.45]It's not a scam.
[547:09.95]Well, I want to do this legit.
[547:11.43]If I'm going to beat Diablo hardcore, I want to be for real.
[547:14.59]I don't want to dupe 50 million gold or something.
[547:23.24]Up there.
[547:40.92]Oh no!
[547:41.38]It's here.
[547:42.46]It's here.
[547:43.30]I found it.
[547:44.17]He's here.
[547:47.18]Cry my Duke glitch.
[547:48.06]It's not a scam, I promise.
[547:50.82]Just stand on the outside of the Rogan camp and drop your best item on the ground.
[547:59.15]Oh, sorry.
[548:00.05]I'm a sorceress with telekinesis and I'm just going to pick it up.
[548:03.83]See, if you're outside the camp, this is for security so I don't get it.
[548:07.21]I know all the tricks, but...
[548:12.81]Yeah, drop.
[548:13.39]You guys remember that too?
[548:14.13]Yeah, I do.
[548:15.23]I remember just being in the rogue encampment with eight people that are strangers.
[548:19.73]And I don't know why the fuck we did this.
[548:21.07]We were psychos.
[548:22.03]I don't know what was wrong with us.
[548:25.05]But everybody would stand around and you would just run to this because no one's paying attention.
[548:28.50]You don't tell anybody this.
[548:30.36]And you just drop one of the best items in the whole game and pick it back up quick.
[548:34.98]You just, oh hey, there's like 10 people there.
[548:36.28]I don't know.
[548:36.62]I'm strangers to fucking all of you.
[548:39.00]I'm going to drop the best weapon in the entire game over here, like 100 feet away, and wait until somebody runs over here and pick it up.
[548:46.41]And sometimes somebody would get it.
[548:48.29]And at that point, you just exit and quit game.
[548:51.61]You're not getting it back.
[549:00.83]But it always was so fucked up when you did that right next to somebody and they just missed it.
[549:08.07]Now, this game was taken dead seriously back in the day.
[549:10.79]It was 15, 20 plus years ago, guys.
[549:13.51]If somebody were to get a grandfather two-handed greatsword without even trying, and it was a great roll, that took hundreds of fucking hundreds and hundreds of hours to find that.
[549:24.22]Just rolling dice.
[549:31.72]Now imagine if it was right in front of you.
[549:34.16]And you had an opportunity.
[549:35.00]It was this far away.
[549:36.28]And you didn't get it.
[549:39.40]That shit happens all the time.
[549:40.28]People are crazy.
[549:51.59]I'm not even over here.
[549:52.27]This is the biggest dungeon I've ever seen in my whole life.
[549:55.85]Why is this dungeon so huge?
[549:58.11]Why is it so big?
[549:58.73]I don't remember being this big.
[550:02.23]There it is.
[550:05.75]I think he missed.
[550:12.10]Is it always this big?
[550:13.86]Maybe.
[550:14.14]Okay.
[550:18.56]I need to make a town run.
[550:19.64]Parents of hate level two on hell says hi.
[550:26.91]Yeah.
[550:31.32]That area is such a blur to me, though, because I have like a 300% magic find sorceress.
[550:36.77]And you just... Level 3.
[550:41.71]Static, static, static, static, static.
[550:43.23]Nova, nova, nova.
[550:44.10]Give me my items.
[550:44.72]Do it again.
[550:45.44]You do it like 100 times in a day.
[550:58.04]Alright, I need to get this actually situated.
[551:00.88]We need... Uh, what is it for rejuvenation potions?
[551:06.11]It is... Come on.
[551:11.17]It's three of each, right?
[551:13.05]Okay.
[551:23.75]Is this even necessary?
[551:25.17]Not.
[551:26.43]I don't need like a full stack inventory of potions.
[551:30.87]Just mana.
[551:32.37]Put this in the stash.
[551:35.11]I'll figure it out later.
[551:38.62]Okay, here we go.
[551:44.20]Kim subbed?
[551:44.90]Did she really?
[551:48.51]Kim, thanks for the sub.
[551:50.01]Oh, somebody gifted her a sub.
[551:51.65]Okay.
[551:53.17]Hey, Spleen.
[551:53.55]Thanks for gifting Kim a sub.
[551:59.07]Alright, so remember the plan here is to spam potions with the inventory open.
[552:04.67]And just make sure I keep my Golem and Vic alive.
[552:08.44]That's the plan.
[552:10.60]How many town portals do I have?
[552:11.68]Plenty?
[552:12.60]Okay, I'm ready.
[552:31.11]Level up.
[552:31.43]Yeah, yeah.
[552:32.05]Level, level, level, level, level, level, level.
[552:34.07]Yes, yes, yes.
[552:34.71]Stop, stop.
[552:35.21]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[552:35.79]No, no, no.
[552:36.63]Alright.
[552:36.97]Hold on.
[552:40.69]Do I need this many potions?
[552:42.73]No, but I've died to Durial dozens of times on normal running around in a circle.
[552:46.66]So, yeah.
[552:47.42]Maybe I do.
[552:48.00]Fix that.
[552:58.50]Five points.
[553:12.19]All good things must come to an end.
[553:18.81]If you can win here against Uriel, you can beat Bael.
[553:24.65]Without dying once to the Ancients, that's going to be tricky.
[553:36.88]Vitality.
[553:38.70]And pick a skill.
[553:50.23]The ancients are actually a joke for Skelemancer.
[553:52.25]Are they really?
[553:53.95]I'm not sure I've ever played a summoner all the way that far.
[554:01.44]I usually just get bored and give up because you just watch 20 people fight on the screen and I'm always like, yeah, I'm done.
[554:09.16]And then I make a paladin or something.
[554:14.50]What is corpse explosion is under poison and bone.
[554:24.74]Yeah, I have Amplify damage already.
[554:34.18]The Burning Souls in Act 4 that one-shot you, yeah.
[554:37.34]Hopefully we'll have some decent items by then if that happens.
[554:42.19]Okay.
[554:44.29]You guys want to go Poison and Bone?
[554:48.27]Is it because somebody came in and said that they had 5,000 hours in the game?
[554:52.10]And now you're embarrassed that you didn't pick the best spell in the game?
[554:54.36]Is that what's going on?
[555:04.70]Okay.
[555:09.16]No, no, no.
[555:10.04]You pick something from here.
[555:11.64]You pick something from here.
[555:12.78]I'm not going back to summoning.
[555:15.15]You've already made your choice.
[555:16.47]You pick something from here.
[555:17.31]I'm not going back.
[555:19.62]Corpse Explosion.
[555:20.64]Which one is Corpse Explosion?
[555:23.26]Why?
[555:23.86]This is not going to do anything for Durial.
[555:34.44]No, no.
[555:34.74]We're not going.
[555:35.24]We're not doing the back and forth.
[555:36.58]Like, he, he, he, back and forth.
[555:38.33]We're going to go summoning.
[555:39.47]No, just kidding.
[555:43.57]Alright, Corpse Explosion it is.
[555:48.06]I know there's at least 8% of you, they're clicking on teeth, but... Corpse explosion.
[555:54.44]Okay.
[556:01.24]It was vitality and corpse explosion.
[556:03.93]And you guys, didn't you guys, wait, wait, no, wait, wait, wait, we've leveled up, we've leveled up.
[556:07.65]And you guys didn't even know you could, oh, we've leveled up, we've leveled up.
[556:10.11]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[556:12.75]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[556:17.61]We're going to revote because I didn't show you.
[556:22.05]Iron Golem is available.
[556:24.85]And so is Summon Resist.
[556:28.69]This gives Resist all elements to all of your summoned creatures.
[556:35.40]Or Iron Golem.
[556:37.58]Transform a weapon or item into a Golem.
[556:41.70]And it has thorns.
[556:47.61]Well, you could do bone wall.
[556:51.41]You've already put one here.
[556:54.43]Can I interest you in dim vision?
[556:56.81]Do that again.
[557:07.65]Where do you want to go?
[557:26.86]That was very quick.
[557:35.52]Iron Golem is a fancy way to save a robot.
[557:38.52]Alright, we're staying in summoning.
[557:45.93]Durgle doesn't do elemental damage.
[557:47.65]Durgle does a lot of cold damage.
[557:49.01]What are we doing?
[557:54.20]Ooh, he's going to be tight.
[557:56.28]New golem?
[557:58.34]Or resist?
[558:03.96]Swings for physical.
[558:05.67]He has a frost aura.
[558:08.31]Everything's going to get one shot anyways, including me.
[558:14.17]40% of Duriel's damage is cold.
[558:15.55]That's what I thought too.
[558:27.27]Okay, are you ready?
[558:29.58]I'm calling it.
[558:30.22]We're doing summon and resist.
[558:42.25]It was vitality, right?
[558:43.33]Summon and resist 28% to all elements.
[558:50.15]And then it was vitality.
[558:53.25]Well, this is the shot.
[558:54.50]Take it.
[558:59.32]What was it?
[558:59.96]It was... No, it was Vitality.
[559:02.14]Was it?
[559:03.50]No, it was.
[559:04.02]It was.
[559:04.24]I remember.
[559:04.52]Okay.
[559:05.44]Okay, here we go.
[559:20.32]Blood Golem on queue.
[559:23.80]Page open.
[559:26.46]No, that's too distracting.
[559:27.66]Go, get in.
[559:44.76]Okay.
[559:45.40]Ball him.
[559:45.76]Get him.
[559:47.25]I threw off the poacher on the ground.
[560:27.62]That was something.
[560:28.46]I don't have a chance.
[560:30.96]Well, hold on.
[560:34.84]Let me... Let's... You think I can fight him one-on-one?
[560:50.89]I have to go one-on-one.
[561:10.05]Is he gonna one-hit kill me?
[561:10.85]He's not gonna one-hit kill me, right?
[561:31.68]Alright, fight him.
[561:37.98]Is this doing anything?
[561:56.91]This is gonna take forever.
[562:04.94]If I drop below 50% health, I'm running.
[562:06.74]I'm just spamming potions.
[562:22.21]Get him.
[562:23.45]Double team him.
[562:49.50]Thaw!
[562:49.78]Thaw!
[562:50.04]Thaw!
[562:50.38]I'm in the corner!
[562:50.94]I'm in the corner!
[562:51.68]TP out of here!
[562:52.18]TP!
[563:01.61]This doesn't do anything.
[563:03.99]I need Skell- Alright, alright.
[563:05.07]Here's the plan.
[563:06.23]I'm gonna load the fuck up on everything.
[563:08.31]I'm gonna go in.
[563:08.95]I'm just gonna spam him for a little bit.
[563:14.37]That's the plan.
[563:21.28]If we... Actually, that's not a bad place to be.
[563:23.20]Because we're all going to be stuffed in the same area.
[563:27.36]And maybe I'll take aggro.
[563:29.09]I need aggro for this to work.
[563:36.97]Hopefully he attacks me first.
[563:41.93]I'd love any enemies on the ground.
[563:43.14]Didn't I kill... Alright, let's go back to Tal'datum.
[563:50.97]Should I just go get like a kite shield?
[563:56.16]Yeah, let's go get the mercenary too.
[563:59.06]Also, by the way, I think he regenerates HP.
[564:10.10]Yes, he does.
[564:18.30]I need to just...
[564:21.16]Oh, these don't do anything.
[564:22.02]This is a waste of time.
[564:22.72]That's a total waste of time.
[564:25.98]I need healing potions.
[564:35.05]Bone wall.
[564:35.59]Bone wall is not going to do anything. ...
[564:50.00]Okay.
[564:51.44]I lose two points in Ray's Skeleton, though.
[564:54.00]If I just put on a shield.
[564:54.80]30 cold... I have 85 cold resist.
[565:06.00]From what?
[565:08.96]Oh!
[565:09.92]That's what Thawing Potion does.
[565:11.02]How long does that last?
[565:15.25]I don't even know if that's what that did.
[565:17.09]I thought it just instantly took cold off.
[565:23.50]Oh, right.
[565:24.55]Okay, well they are worth it then.
[565:41.58]Okay, let's go to the waypoint and get a full army.
[565:48.62]Played Diablo II for 20 years and you don't know what the items do.
[565:52.36]I've never purchased a thawing potion in my whole life ever playing this game.
[565:55.64]There was never a reason for me to.
[565:56.78]I just didn't.
[565:57.60]Ever.
[565:59.96]Alright.
[566:00.95]Let's get the team back together.
[566:02.25]Aren't you guys glad you put a point in the teeth?
[566:34.22]Alright.
[566:35.29]We got the team back.
[566:36.05]Let's get out.
[566:42.63]Five skeletons, three mages.
[566:45.11]Let's go get our mercenary back.
[566:51.70]And then there were ten.
[566:56.12]And I make eleven.
[566:58.42]If I can get in there and tank this.
[567:04.09]Hopefully we can do it.
[567:06.37]Alright.
[567:07.93]You good?
[567:08.65]You good.
[567:09.21]You got some pretty decent things.
[567:12.42]I have 12.
[567:14.18]Alright, you ready?
[567:14.86]3, 2, 1, action!
[567:21.22]I'm tanking him, I'm tanking him.
[568:09.64]Am I gonna die?
[568:11.36]Alright, he's dead.
[568:17.84]We got it, we got it, we got it.
[568:22.24]Kill him.
[568:29.39]Yeah.
[568:30.91]That wasn't that bad.
[568:31.55]That was fine.
[568:33.83]I'm scared for no reason.
[568:41.32]I was scared for no reason.
[568:42.38]That wasn't even that bad.
[568:43.40]That was not even hard.
[568:45.06]That was not even that bad.
[568:53.03]And seal.
[568:53.71]Hopefully this is good.
[569:13.27]Well, uh, plus one to golem mastery.
[569:19.64]Three to bone spear.
[569:26.26]It causes monster to flee.
[569:27.86]Bone spear is pretty good, but it's, I, I, this character's, this character's all over the place.
[569:34.41]I can't even use bone spear.
[569:42.11]Step on the maggots?
[569:51.95]Because I want to have a faster cast rate.
[569:57.68]That's a light radius.
[570:02.24]I have too much strength to have this be worth it.
[570:10.22]Here comes a loud cutscene.
[570:15.02]This is going to be horrible if I keep doing this on Nightmarrow.
[570:20.42]Hell.
[570:23.60]I thank you for my freedom.
[570:26.24]But I did expect you earlier.
[570:28.74]I am the Archangel Tyrion.
[570:30.64]I came here to prevent Diablo from freeing his brother, Bael.
[570:34.50]But I have failed.
[570:36.67]Now, terror and destruction roam free throughout your world.
[570:39.95]Diablo II's got a pretty good story.
[570:41.87]Diablo II's got a good story.
[570:42.91]Towards the eastern capital of Korast, to the very heart of the Zakarum Temple.
[570:47.70]There they hope to find their eldest brother, Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, who was imprisoned there ages ago.
[570:54.59]If the three prime evils unite, they will be invincible.
[570:58.88]Though it is unclear as to what their aims are, it is certain that they must be stopped at all costs.
[571:07.00]This is stupid.
[571:07.90]Okay.
[571:08.70]Sorry you feel that way.
[571:10.26]Time is running out.
[571:11.02]Alright.
[571:12.44]Alright, let's go back.
[571:13.54]13 to 24.
[571:36.29]fire damage and a stolen lots of attack rating better than this right slow attack speed kane can do this for free yep
[572:04.23]Let us choose your weapons.
[572:09.15]That would be an absolute disaster.
[572:14.99]That wouldn't go over very well.
[572:19.01]Let's go to Act 3, and then we can do... End of the stream.
[572:26.25]Let's go.
[572:39.89]Please show stats and stuff?
[572:40.87]I will.
[572:42.17]I will show you exactly what people have decided to do.
[572:47.46]Play Act 3 real quick.
[572:51.96]No, I'm going to kill Andariel one more time.
[573:00.18]Just YouTube this cutscene.
[573:01.36]It's pretty good.
[573:03.90]Welcome to Khoras, traveler.
[573:06.29]Few come willingly to this ancient city anymore.
[573:10.13]I hope you brought your wits with you, for sanity is in short supply here.
[573:19.54]Mephisto's running rampant on here.
[573:20.94]This lore.
[573:22.08]Yeah, but it's 20-year-old lore.
[573:27.68]It's 20-year-old lore.
[573:28.70]You now speak to Ormus.
[573:32.20]So?
[573:32.98]I'm kidding.
[573:36.98]I just want to speed this up because it is getting late.
[573:42.44]Okay, we'll go over a full what happened in Diablo II.
[573:44.98]I promise.
[573:45.42]Next time.
[573:45.94]The potion guy.
[574:03.97]That's a lot of money.
[574:12.12]Alright.
[574:13.58]Alright, alright, alright.
[574:17.48]Alright, let's go kill on Dariel.
[574:19.02]I'm going to try to do it as fast as I can.
[574:20.92]Why would you want to watch Act 3?
[574:27.37]Good question.
[574:27.89]Alright, let's go.
[574:35.63]How does it look so weird?
[574:52.67]Alright, let's go.
[574:53.05]Quick.
[574:53.19]Quickly.
[574:53.77]Quickly.
[575:07.64]Wait.
[575:09.98]If you play the game on single player... Does it?
[575:19.10]Can you act... Can... Is this... Do I need to see this for the rest of the... Really?
[575:33.66]Went the wrong way.
[575:39.93]Usually, if you reset a game, doesn't it... I thought that it reset the dungeon, too.
[575:47.13]You have to exit the entire game.
[576:05.36]Oh, so this is... Undariel's not going to be down here.
[576:10.73]It's only on B-Net if you close the game.
[576:12.41]So is Andariel not going to be down here?
[576:20.48]He is going to be.
[576:21.22]Oh.
[576:24.08]That makes this way easier.
[576:25.34]Holy shit.
[576:29.06]Alright.
[576:29.44]Wow, I thought that was going to take a lot longer.
[576:33.79]You can just farm the fuck out of bosses on single player.
[576:37.09]Okay.
[576:45.75]Alright, get in there.
[576:53.25]There's also no lag, either.
[576:55.69]So, even though I was shadow banned from Battle.net for some reason, I'm actually not that concerned about it, because when you play it on old Bnet, sometimes the game would just hang for five straight seconds, and that happened all the damn time.
[577:09.22]There was this weird, like, half-second lag on everything you did.
[577:14.86]Actually, I'm kind of glad I am playing it on here.
[577:20.52]Change to eight players.
[577:25.86]Not a bad idea.
[577:27.77]Alright, we're good.
[577:37.45]Ow.
[577:47.52]If you guys would like to see the original loot box, look no further than what I'm doing right now.
[577:54.74]Except this is free.
[578:07.51]Oh shit, she just killed my friend.
[578:21.80]and we're gonna get oh too bad too bad 21 uh
[578:54.36]Do it again.
[578:54.70]One more time.
[578:56.30]Do it again.
[578:56.68]One more time.
[578:57.24]Do it one more time.
[578:58.00]One more time.
[578:58.38]That's it.
[578:58.66]One more time.
[579:00.34]That's it.
[579:00.76]That's actually it.
[579:01.59]One more time.
[579:02.03]That'd be 30 times.
[579:02.93]Done.
[579:03.67]And that's it.
[579:07.95]Okay.
[579:13.07]And I'm not doing Act 3.
[579:16.88]No.
[579:17.72]It's 10 fucking hours.
[579:18.56]No.
[579:18.64]I'm not.
[579:18.94]We're gonna call it.
[579:33.89]Alright, let's go.
[579:39.89]I want to open another loot box.
[579:40.93]I just want to get one more unique.
[579:42.79]You know what I mean?
[579:43.71]What the hell?
[579:54.99]Wait.
[580:07.14]I swear to God, this is the last time.
[580:09.12]This is not happening anymore.
[580:10.00]It's actually true.
[580:13.09]Not happening.
[580:14.01]Not gonna happen.
[580:17.03]I figured it was gonna take me at least 20 minutes to get over here.
[580:19.45]I didn't realize I could keep doing this until we reset difficulty.
[580:25.15]That's awesome.
[580:29.55]He said that with Lord of the Rings.
[580:30.88]No, this is different, though, because with the Lord of the Rings stream, I wasn't planning on streaming the next day.
[580:36.34]I'm streaming today.
[580:38.74]I'm streaming today.
[580:40.48]So I'm done after this.
[580:53.33]Alright, let's go.
[580:56.87]You've got kids to take care of.
[581:02.27]It's not too bad.
[581:03.01]We're good.
[581:06.00]Come on.
[581:14.42]Don't get fucking... I can still get trapped and killed.
[581:27.94]EU's just waking up.
[581:28.99]No, this is it.
[581:31.87]We're gonna get a decent unique right here.
[581:34.68]It'll carry me all the way through Act 3 and then we can beat normal hell.
[581:40.45]Let's go.
[581:58.85]Hold on, there's an extra strong here.
[582:05.11]Soul Sludge.
[582:05.87]You're gonna sneeze.
[582:09.39]I just get slapped in the face while I sneeze.
[582:15.92]No, it's like, don't sneeze, don't do it!
[582:17.36]Somebody just fucking cracked me.
[582:40.39]get in there kill oh don't don't come after me don't come after
[583:09.20]Unique.
[583:13.00]Fuck.
[583:21.57]Sucks.
[583:24.93]Sucks.
[583:26.31]Sucks.
[583:26.55]Alright, I'm out.
[583:27.37]Save.
[583:27.87]Just leave.
[583:29.83]Done.
[583:30.77]Okay.
[583:32.83]Oh.
[583:33.85]Good.
[583:34.62]Alright.
[583:35.40]See you tomorrow.
[583:36.24]Or later today.
[583:36.84]Whatever you want to call it.
[583:40.83]That was a lot of fun.
[583:41.55]I did not think I was going to get that far.
[583:43.87]I thought that we were going to get destroyed.
[583:46.14]I thought I was going to make it through the first two hours of the game, but turns out, still going.
[583:57.70]That's pretty good.
[584:00.75]We'll have to continue that.
[584:13.21]So before we play that again, I'm going to try to do a better way to have you guys interact with that instead of having weird images pop up on the screen.
[584:22.42]Good old-fashioned coward strategies.
[584:23.88]They work every time.
[584:24.62]Have you ever tried hardcore?
[584:27.94]No, that's the first time I've ever played hardcore in any of the Diablo games.
[584:33.19]Never done it.
[584:34.91]But I thought it was great.
[584:37.33]That was fun.
[584:45.25]Was it fun to stream?
[584:48.11]Yeah, I mean, games like this are easy to stream because... I mean, yeah, it's hardcore and I don't want to die.
[584:54.84]But the menial minute-to-minute is that we can just talk about whatever.
[584:58.96]Just chill and just do whatever.
[585:00.00]Nice change of pace.
[585:01.96]The game was just playing itself.
[585:17.08]But let's do the bits.
[585:19.80]I'm going to go through these fairly quickly.
[585:23.96]For obvious reasons, because it's getting very, very late.
[585:25.86]I'm not going to do it super duper insanely fast to the point where I blow through everyone's donations.
[585:30.47]But fast enough where we go bing, bing, bing.
[585:38.83]And then tomorrow, I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.
[585:43.78]I have to talk to Joel.
[585:45.38]We'll see if tomorrow is going to be keep talking or it could be the next day after that.
[585:50.74]I will let you know before the stream starts tomorrow.
[585:53.02]You will know.
[585:53.42]Alright, let's go.
[585:58.13]We had a thousand bits from acidic vengeance.
[586:02.53]They say for your Diablo II unbanned fund.
[586:06.85]Still can't believe that.
[586:12.78]Fucking crazy.
[586:15.08]And I found that out 20 minutes before the stream started.
[586:22.17]Oh well.
[586:23.55]I've got like a scratchy voice today too.
[586:25.03]I don't know what's going on.
[586:25.79]I've been drinking plenty of water.
[586:29.60]Weird.
[586:30.72]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[586:33.16]potion dweller thanks for the 250 uh congrats on duping chat into one giving you necromancer two giving you summons instead of worthless curses you may actually win this without dying now chat I'm very disappointed in you for not going throw barbarian so many classes and so many combinations would have been so terrible for this
[587:06.28]Yes, potion find barbarian would have been the absolute worst thing possible.
[587:14.61]I wouldn't have any moves.
[587:16.91]I would have to default click on people.
[587:22.28]This sucked.
[587:36.30]A.B.
[587:36.60]Joe gave 5,000 bits earlier.
[587:41.37]I think we talked about it, but they said... There's a paste bin here.
[587:45.51]It's a dream.
[587:46.69]Holy shit, this is long.
[587:50.35]I got a dream for you.
[587:54.54]Let's see.
[587:54.84]Let me... This is very long.
[587:58.72]What happened?
[587:59.40]What did you eat before this dream?
[588:02.30]Okay, I'm going to go through this because this is actually interesting to me.
[588:07.23]Uh, I had a very odd dream the other night.
[588:08.67]This might be kind of long, but please bear with me.
[588:11.17]It was evening and I had come home early.
[588:14.01]You had set up some sort of obstacle course at the beach with all sorts of odd challenges.
[588:17.48]You were at the beginning of the obstacle course, ushering people in with a big grin, but when I tried to initiate a conversation, you ignored me.
[588:24.84]I decided to carry on.
[588:26.63]There were many obstacles in your course, one of them you had to drive an actual train down some cartoon tracks at speeds that would in no way allow that train to remain on said tracks, and in another, you literally just had to bend down and grab an empty can of Monster Ultra with sunglasses drawn on paper taped to them, and hand one over to Gabe Newell, also wearing sunglasses, who was apparently running that segment.
[588:49.49]After that, you had to slide up a water slide to the top, which was about 50 feet tall, and had to jump into the ocean to get back down because landing in water doesn't give you fall damage.
[588:59.26]There were other people there also attempting to complete your obstacle course, although I don't remember much about them other than the fact that they were there.
[589:05.80]I was going through a...
[589:17.07]These streams are becoming creative writing exercises.
[589:24.14]Sorry, stop for a second.
[589:29.64]Where are we?
[589:30.26]Where were we?
[589:31.54]I went... I was going through, okay... A jungle section, jungle gym section that you would find at one of those old McDonald's play places.
[589:43.70]And I saw the kid in front of me go through a clear, thin plastic roof above me that had air holes poked in it.
[589:50.36]I asked him how he did that, and he asked me if I had the right version.
[589:53.00]I said I didn't know.
[589:53.90]He told me that I needed the right version of the map to continue this section of the challenge as that was the way through.
[589:59.12]I had no idea what he was talking about, so I did the only thing that came to mind and cut through the plastic with a serrated pocket knife I had on my person.
[590:09.09]Telling the kid to be careful as he was still there, even handing it over at some point, telling him where to cut, as he couldn't see what he was cutting because we were on different versions of the game.
[590:23.42]After that, I had run into another obstacle later down the line, and the same kid showed up and asked me which power-up I had chosen at the station at the beginning of the obstacle course.
[590:32.73]That you had manned.
[590:33.55]I said, I didn't have one.
[590:34.61]He said, you need to choose one to complete the obstacle course.
[590:37.95]He then T-posed over a pit of mud that was in our way.
[590:41.72]Not sure what to do next.
[590:43.24]I decided that I was going to probably... That going around probably wouldn't hurt anyone.
[590:48.26]But as soon as I did, a bunch of germous suns surrounded me and forced me back on the path.
[590:51.38]And people behind me booed until I tried jumping over it, only to fall to my death.
[590:57.47]Fake dream feels weird.
[591:26.65]Dude, dreams are so fucked up, you never know.
[591:30.53]It could be completely real.
[591:35.10]That sounds pretty, that could be accurate.
[591:40.46]Keeping a dream journal is the most fun things you can do.
[591:42.44]Well, you heard the dream about the tiger is in the plane and shit like that.
[591:45.94]The only reason I even remember that happened is because I wrote it down.
[591:51.24]So yeah, this wild shit happens.
[591:59.00]Snarbosis, so Snarbosis, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[592:01.90]20 from Zap.
[592:04.34]You caught Zaps, I remember that.
[592:06.38]We didn't see Snarbossises.
[592:07.87]Snarbossises, yeah.
[592:10.59]Thanks, both of you.
[592:13.57]Uh, Friedelschlitz.
[592:16.37]It's Friedelschlitz, thanks for the 250.
[592:17.85]Can you tell me to stop procrastinating and go do my homework?
[592:22.52]Go, just get out, go, go, get out of here, go.
[592:24.44]What are you doing still here?
[592:27.24]Oh wait, this is like 8 hours ago.
[592:28.38]I hope you did it.
[592:30.12]I hope you did it.
[592:35.64]Uh, Futanari.
[592:36.70]Thanks for the 1500 bits.
[592:38.71]Yay, mountain stream.
[592:45.63]Potion dweller, thanks for the 250.
[592:47.03]I apologize to chat as it's clear they wanted to keep you alive.
[592:50.25]Now that's out of the way, you owe it to yourself to try Path of Exile.
[592:52.63]Uh, I've played Path of Exile before.
[592:55.69]I do not like it.
[592:58.05]The reason I do not like it is I do not like the camera.
[593:02.26]I think the camera... I don't like it.
[593:04.24]It's kind of close and too high.
[593:05.64]It's one of the only pet peeves I have of the whole game.
[593:10.28]I do not like the camera in Path of Exile.
[593:15.59]That's it.
[593:17.01]I've tried to play it two or three times now.
[593:27.13]sad camera noises remember you just said a porn term what I don't know I'm supposed to know what porn terms are okay whatever whatever alright fine fine sure alright
[593:57.48]Have gone thanks to the 250.
[593:58.78]Hey, Mr.. Elbertson chat keeps telling me to watch the streamer called jermaOn 85 The stream is bland and his fans only like him because they have Stockholm syndrome Watch this other streamer called BF Bugleberry instead.
[594:11.33]It only does 11-minute streams Out the joke is over.
[594:16.47]I think you should watch Jojo at some point Also watch redline
[594:31.00]We had a long conversation about JoJo.
[594:32.71]Listen to my voice right now.
[594:33.73]This is kind of fucked up.
[594:34.69]Why?
[594:36.17]I know you just heard like an explosion or like a gunshot at my room.
[594:40.39]That was a battery.
[594:44.77]Nine hours?
[594:45.29]No, it was like this before too.
[594:47.25]It was like this like six or seven hours ago.
[594:53.16]My throat.
[594:53.62]I can feel it.
[594:54.54]I don't know why.
[594:57.34]Oh yeah, we talked about JoJo already.
[595:00.33]My anime for 2020 is... What was it?
[595:11.21]Ping Pong.
[595:11.79]That's what it was.
[595:12.57]Ping Pong.
[595:16.22]We deliberated for a while.
[595:19.30]In San Diego, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[595:20.84]Appreciate it.
[595:24.70]10 subs.
[595:25.40]A lot of money.
[595:30.29]People drop 5 and 10 subs on this channel.
[595:34.05]Dozens of times the stream.
[595:35.37]Just 10, 10, 10, 10, 5, 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20, 20.

[595:54.20]I appreciate it.
[595:59.24]All the love.
[596:05.48]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[596:09.88]Espada Escalada 250 doing this for the channel points.
[596:12.96]What do you mean channel points?
[596:14.32]250?
[596:22.60]Wait, you get channel points for giving bits?
[596:28.36]Is that how some of you guys have gotten to 75,000 so fast?
[596:37.83]Holy shit.
[596:38.79]I didn't know that.
[596:41.23]Once a month.
[596:41.91]Oh, okay.
[596:42.21]Oh, that's cool.
[596:44.78]Phylactery gave $50 and they said Jerm of the Ridge is fucking $75.
[596:50.12]Well, Phylactery, thank you for almost buying me a second one.
[596:53.90]I need a second one.
[596:54.90]This time I'm going to get the chrome one.
[596:58.54]I like that one.
[596:59.13]I was going to get that one.
[597:01.93]There's another wink.
[597:04.57]Where?
[597:04.71]Oh, there wasn't.
[597:08.83]Oh my fucking god, somebody actually did.
[597:10.47]You guys getting this shit so fast?
[597:28.54]What a shitty fucking thing for channel points.
[597:32.00]I'm realizing this now.
[597:33.88]What a bad thing for channel points.
[597:43.09]We will continue.
[597:43.95]Hey, but thank you, Phylactery, for the 5,000 bits.
[597:59.43]$50.
[597:59.45]Phylactery gives money.
[598:05.46]An insane amount of money.
[598:06.76]Almost every single stream.
[598:12.01]Every single fucking time.
[598:16.07]Thanks, phylactery, again.
[598:18.11]And always.
[598:21.47]Appreciate it.
[598:23.47]LM, man, thanks for the thousand bits.
[598:24.63]Jerma, if you were a chef, would your signature dish be ratatouille?
[598:30.54]No.
[598:31.56]It'd be a pan seared salmon.
[598:37.68]Pan seared salmon with lemon and oil.
[598:43.87]Good.
[598:45.41]LM, man.
[598:45.85]Again, 500 bits.
[598:47.19]Don't drink water.
[598:48.03]Drink oil.
[598:48.65]Why would I drink oil?
[598:58.11]Tingy, thanks for the 250.
[599:01.17]Hey, Dermot, I just want to say thanks to you and your banana advice, I have beat my 30-year crippling nicotine addiction and stopped vaping.
[599:08.41]Bananas are all I eat now, all day, every day, 365 days a year.
[599:12.48]I eat, sleep, and breathe bananas.
[599:13.88]Thanks again.
[599:14.64]You've changed my life forever.
[599:17.20]Good for you.
[599:19.20]You learned that eating bananas is all you have to do.
[599:23.54]Don't eat too many.
[599:24.78]Don't get radioactive.
[599:32.58]Deadly SP.
[599:33.52]Thanks for the 1500 bits.
[599:35.66]$15.
[599:37.40]Jeremy, it's me, Alex Cora.
[599:39.50]Why the hell haven't you answered my calls?
[599:41.08]Things aren't good, Jeremy.
[599:42.21]I had to step down because of you.
[599:44.37]You said no one was going to find out.
[599:45.69]You said it was going to work out.
[599:47.41]The commissioner thinks I'm the one who came up with this.
[599:50.05]But I'm going to tell the truth.
[599:51.51]I'm going to tell the whole world that you, Jerma985, were the one who came up with the sign stealing.
[599:57.10]Even your buddy chat can't stop me.
[599:58.76]You won't.
[599:59.22]I gotta go out of this.
[600:04.24]Half the people in this chat don't know what you're talking about.
[600:08.20]I do.
[600:13.74]How dare you.
[600:19.58]Zeroni, thanks for the $10,000 bits.
[600:21.74]Jeremy, it's Andrew from Ridge Wallet.
[600:24.38]We're having trouble with the corporate account, so we're dispersing your first payment in bits.
[600:29.24]The whole team is looking forward to your next endorsement.
[600:31.33]Thanks for the $10,000.
[600:41.84]It is like a nice wallet.
[600:43.22]It's it's clean it's Sleek I know there's a buzzwords for when you bought something that was expensive But I really do like these and I've used stuff like this before I've used a wallet that was supposed to be a little tiny little steel wallet before and I think was a piece of shit This thing is not a piece of shit It's clean it's nice high-grade steel
[601:13.75]Hey.
[601:16.75]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[601:18.51]Those of you that have been to Las Vegas that took me up on my go-to hash house a go-go in the link and get the blue cheese burger.
[601:27.23]I know at least six or seven people have done that over the last year.
[601:31.08]And what did they come back and say?
[601:34.98]What did they come back and say?
[601:38.30]Oh, that was the best thing I've ever eaten in my life.
[601:43.00]So,
[601:46.36]I'm not bullshitting here.
[601:47.70]This is a good wallet.
[601:49.22]You can trust me.
[601:59.09]Trust me.
[602:00.27]Blue cheese is gross.
[602:01.19]I'm sorry.
[602:02.05]You don't have to apologize for being incorrect.
[602:05.93]You just have to feel shame in what you said was wrong.
[602:16.10]Thank you, too.
[602:17.66]We got another one.
[602:19.54]Mr. Goido, thanks for the $2.50.
[602:21.02]I had a dream that Jerma drank his own piss on stream.
[602:23.36]Haha.
[602:24.34]Oh, my God.
[602:25.19]Why are there so many of these today?
[602:35.39]Look how annoyed I look.
[602:39.85]Hey, it's been 10 hours.
[602:40.93]We just crossed 10 hours.
[602:50.69]Let's get the credits on screen.
[602:52.73]That's what we do.
[602:54.51]I have no idea what's going to happen tomorrow.
[602:57.31]Hopefully I wake up.
[602:58.85]I should.
[603:01.00]Money changed this guy.
[603:02.34]He used to be so fucking nicer.
[603:05.30]He was so much cooler.
[603:06.34]He didn't have Ridge wallets.
[603:07.72]He didn't drink Fiji water.
[603:09.18]He didn't buy original hardware to play his Wii games on.
[603:17.58]I don't even remember the last time that I heard him sneeze.
[603:24.26]Come on.
[603:24.54]Come on.
[603:24.96]Damn it.
[603:25.36]That would have been funny.
[603:28.24]Would have been funny.
[603:28.78]Sneeze is coming on.
[603:29.36]It's okay.
[603:32.86]That would have been funny.
[603:33.86]Come on.
[603:34.54]Let's get the credits rolling.
[603:41.72]Like I said before, thanks for all the subs, everybody.
[603:48.14]That dream is really fucked up.
[603:52.22]Old Jerma would have sneezed.
[603:55.70]Yeah, we'll see what we do tomorrow.
[603:56.94]I gotta... Let me look.
[603:59.32]If me and Joel don't do anything tomorrow, we do it the next day.
[604:01.58]So much good shit over here.
[604:10.13]There's so much good stuff over here.
[604:15.41]I don't even know what to choose.
[604:16.27]There's so many good games.
[604:20.30]deadly creatures for the Wii.
[604:23.02]We play the fucking Scorpion.
[604:34.15]I don't know.
[604:34.41]We'll see.
[604:34.81]We'll figure it out.
[604:40.06]But anyway, the credits are supposed to be on.
[604:41.14]What the hell am I doing?
[604:48.58]Is tomorrow going to be more D2?
[604:50.05]We'll probably take a break from it.
[604:51.89]This was a long session here.
[604:55.85]10 hours of Diablo II.
[604:56.85]I don't want to have Diablo II exhaustion.
[605:06.05]We will probably do Diablo II again.
[605:12.48]At some point this weekend, probably.
[605:18.17]Why are the credits not running?
[605:22.61]What time is the stream going to be tomorrow?
[605:25.83]Well, I have to eat.
[605:26.79]I'm probably not going to get to bed until about... I'm probably not going to get to bed until about 3.
[605:31.71]So I don't think this is going to be like a 1 p.m.
[605:35.29]or a 12 p.m.
[605:36.15]stream tomorrow.
[605:38.49]So I got to talk to Joel, too.
[605:39.59]Joel, is he streaming?
[605:48.31]Streaming right now?
[605:48.89]Okay.
[605:48.99]I wonder if he said anything on Discord.
[605:52.39]Let me just check.
[606:00.20]Why are the credits not rolling?
[606:01.20]I'm getting upset.
[606:02.44]There they are.
[606:03.84]And they're incredibly fast.
[606:05.02]Glory.
[606:06.22]Alright, uh, let's see.
[606:07.64]Anything on Discord from Joel?
[606:08.61]Thanks again, everybody.
[606:09.29]Seriously.
[606:09.71]Another long one.
[606:13.63]But this was long because I was kind of addicted to the game.
[606:20.35]Last thing that we said was... Let me see.
[606:26.04]We said... Just have my computer upgraded.
[606:38.27]I have a ton of issues.
[606:40.97]Alright.
[606:41.31]So we'll see.
[606:42.39]I'll be around the next few days.
[606:43.41]Alright.
[606:45.77]Yeah.
[606:45.87]Let me just hit him a line.
[606:55.04]I'm going to say, I'm going to be around tomorrow, the next day, whatever's better for you.
[607:00.43]And then... We'll go from there.
[607:08.53]Bits just came in right now.
[607:10.85]Or a couple minutes ago.
[607:11.73]It was Flugboy.
[607:13.30]What's going on, Flugboy?
[607:15.32]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[607:16.58]$10 right at the end here.
[607:21.05]They say, hey, Jerma, gonna drop you some moderately sized bits tonight.
[607:25.03]It's always kind of weird to me that I've been watching you for this long, and it's always wonderful to see new people.
[607:28.83]I agree.
[607:30.86]I love seeing new people.
[607:33.08]There was this huge Destiny puzzle that came out recently, and it brought literally the entire community's heads together.
[607:39.66]And it kind of reminds me of the Hive Mine.
[607:41.98]That is chat that pulls together to just poke some fun of you.
[607:44.74]It's really amazing.
[607:46.24]Keep up everything you do.
[607:47.22]It's always nice to talk to you.
[607:51.02]That's part of the fun.
[607:55.51]Thanks a lot, Floodboy.
[607:57.97]That's part of the fun, though.
[608:03.19]The splendor of the piss, Berkey.
[608:07.81]Alright, goodnight, guys.
[608:08.59]I'll see you tomorrow.
[608:09.99]Whether we do Keep Talking or something else, I'll be around tomorrow afternoon.
[608:16.96]Once I figure out what's going on, this stuff will be updated accordingly.
[608:23.38]And I'll see you tomorrow or later today.
[608:26.30]Good night, guys.
[608:26.74]Take care.
[608:28.41]See you soon.
[608:52.03]you
[609:26.91]you
