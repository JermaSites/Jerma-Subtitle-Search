[00:01.97]Hey.
[00:03.72]Yeah, sorry.
[00:04.76]Sorry I'm late.
[00:06.98]I wasn't supposed to be.
[00:08.90]I was sitting here.
[00:10.66]Just ready to go.
[00:11.38]We were pre-stream chatting.
[00:13.46]I was here.
[00:15.64]And then I had to take out the dog.
[00:20.49]That was true.
[00:22.75]Actually, I didn't even tell any lies.
[00:25.74]just didn't tell you the truth I was holding back the truth from you I wasn't lying to you I just wasn't telling I wasn't telling you what was going on is that a lie that's not lying I just wasn't telling you the truth I wasn't telling you anything is withholding information a lie or is that just withholding information that's not a lie that's just withholding info
[00:57.77]It's called a lie of omission.
[01:02.31]Well, anyways.
[01:04.02]I had to update my GeForce 1080.
[01:08.06]Apparently there's an update today.
[01:09.66]And, oh boy.
[01:11.16]Halo Reach is going to be running at over 100 FPS.
[01:13.87]I can guarantee you that one.
[01:16.38]That was a pre-stream chat joke.
[01:18.42]I know I told everybody in the pre-stream before that I don't do... That's exclusive material for pre-stream chat.
[01:24.67]And I just used it.
[01:26.11]So... Sorry.
[01:32.57]You have a million dollars.
[01:34.05]Get a 2080 Ti.
[01:36.89]Um... I don't have a million dollars.
[01:41.73]Your math is off by a little.
[01:44.00]I do not have a million dollars.
[01:49.68]He has 5 million.
[01:51.24]Nope.
[01:52.44]Nope.
[01:57.91]Look, when you spend all your money on carnivals, Halloweens, and Minecraft servers, your CPA gets kind of annoyed with you.
[02:15.49]He's a trillionaire.
[02:16.76]He's broke.
[02:17.60]I'm not... I'm not... Okay, let me be very clear.
[02:21.14]I don't have a million dollars.
[02:22.85]But I ain't broke.
[02:23.87]Alright?
[02:26.09]But I got a very loud phone call back in October from my financial advisor.
[02:32.05]It was a loud voicemail.
[02:34.12]I could not tell most of the things that they were saying because it sounded like they were yelling very loud into an iPhone.
[02:40.02]And you know what happens when you scream into an iPhone?
[02:43.12]It gets distorted.
[02:44.94]So it was like, I can't... So I have no idea what he was saying.
[02:51.27]Something about... I can't believe... Why would you do that?
[02:54.17]I don't know.
[02:54.75]Something like that.
[02:56.88]Anyways, we're going to continue the Outer Worlds.
[03:03.21]What the hell is a carnival stream?
[03:07.55]All jokes aside, don't worry.
[03:08.83]I'm doing fine.
[03:09.57]I don't have a million dollars though.
[03:12.29]I will do like a celebratory stream if I ever have a million dollars in my fucking checking account.
[03:17.62]Why would I do that?
[03:18.32]That would be fucked up.
[03:23.68]Imagine somebody doing a fucking stream about, I did it, I made it to a million dollars.
[03:32.94]That's some next level fucking like dystopian future type shit.
[03:40.93]I should just do that without having any of that money.
[03:44.96]That's a funny stream.
[03:46.34]It's like a celebration of me crossing a million dollars.
[03:49.28]And there's not, like, not even 5% of that in my bank accounts.
[03:53.03]Across every account I own.
[03:55.13]All my retirement accounts.
[03:56.09]Like, imagine, like, imagine that.
[03:59.57]It would be just, like, fake.
[04:00.81]Alright, you know, like, that big, big controversy on Instagram where people were taking pictures in their backyard and pretending they were going on vacation to Hawaii?
[04:08.63]That's what that is.
[04:20.05]I did it!
[04:20.63]I made it to a million dollars!
[04:24.02]And then like, turns out, I didn't like sell my car and shit, like I didn't have enough money.
[04:29.90]It's like, what a fucked up future.
[04:31.94]What a fucked up stream.
[04:37.12]Hey, speaking of fucking weird futures.
[04:38.66]Here's one right here.
[04:49.81]Why is my iPhone not working?
[04:54.51]I got a million dollars, and I couldn't get an iPhone to work?
[04:56.93]I'm just gonna pick up right where we left off.
[05:11.26]If you don't know, I'm currently playing the Laugh Out Loud Hysterical.
[05:18.06]God, dumb character.
[05:19.98]You've never seen that before.
[05:23.92]Not only am I playing the game like three and a half weeks late, I'm also playing the thing that you may have already watched somebody do ten times.
[05:34.53]But it's different because I'm a doctor too.
[05:37.61]And I might be doing other choices.
[05:40.53]And I got a million dollars.
[05:43.81]Anybody else that you watch got a million dollars?
[05:47.75]Probably.
[05:49.07]Probably way more than that.
[05:52.69]Alright, let's get out of here.
[05:58.17]Let's get going.
[05:58.72]Actually, I gotta tweet this.
[06:05.48]I'm sorry, I missed the context of that joke.
[06:07.02]Why is he talking about having a million dollars?
[06:09.18]Yeah, you had to be there.
[06:14.87]Okay.
[06:14.99]Okay.
[06:17.57]What should I write for a tweet?
[06:18.47]How about just, and I'm just like, I'm relaxing today.
[06:21.53]We're just gonna take it nice and slow.
[06:25.89]More stupid doctor.
[06:28.77]I'm not even a doctor.
[06:29.67]Yeah, I am.
[06:32.27]More, how about more lying doctor?
[06:36.96]You don't ever want your doctor to be a liar.
[06:40.36]That would be really bad.
[06:43.90]It comes in with like your x-ray.
[06:48.76]And you've got... You've got like a tear in your lung.
[06:55.50]And he just tells you... Well, I got your x-ray of your lungs back.
[07:00.58]And... You got stomach acid problem.
[07:06.42]We're gonna get you on some antacids.
[07:09.46]You don't want that.
[07:10.12]Okay, more lying doctor.
[07:15.74]Alright, let's move.
[07:16.72]We can go now.
[07:20.48]Why would they do that?
[07:22.60]Because they're a liar.
[07:23.40]They're a lying doctor.
[07:24.32]That's the character I am.
[07:25.48]That's the character I'm playing right now in this game is a lying, an imbecile lying doctor.
[07:32.63]And the Toast Fart just came in with five community subs.
[07:38.43]Thank you, Toast Fart.
[07:39.53]Appreciate that.
[07:40.19]Thanks, everybody who got those subs because that means you're here and you're watching.
[07:45.23]Thanks to you, too.
[07:46.37]That's a really fucked up looking pig.
[07:47.81]Okay.
[07:53.99]Alright, I was just going to say, if this game is going to run like shit now after I updated my drivers, I would be pretty mad.
[08:00.46]I think it's okay.
[08:08.91]It's alright.
[08:10.67]Fucking G-Force.
[08:21.34]No, it's alright.
[08:21.76]I think it's just initial loading of the game.
[08:26.01]alright so let's take a look at what we will where we left off so last thing I did was I angered a lot of people in the stream because I gave power to edgewater and then the next thing I did is I have to convince all these people from the settlement now to move back to edgewater and one of them said I ain't going anywhere until you uh find me my friend zoe whoever it was and I found zoe and zoe had a ring that I took
[08:55.90]And brought back.
[08:57.30]And I completed that quest.
[08:58.86]None of that was a lie.
[09:00.66]That was just what happened.
[09:01.60]That's the truth.
[09:04.96]So, and then the other person that has to come along is this engineer here.
[09:08.86]The three volumes.
[09:14.13]Tom said he knows that at least one volume is in the local community center.
[09:19.49]Because this is another person that...
[09:24.22]Well, I have to convince all these people to leave.
[09:28.62]So, let's do that.
[09:30.50]Engineering Volume 1, Engineering Vol- I can get all of them?
[09:37.77]And no, this is not- I know you may have seen a playthrough of somebody that threw, like, a grenade over there.
[09:42.03]That's not this one.
[09:46.65]This one, sometimes people die.
[09:49.53]That's it.
[09:53.26]That's it.
[09:54.66]We're not intentional.
[09:58.40]Let's go get Volume 1.
[09:59.94]Just fast travel?
[10:02.24]But isn't fast travel boring?
[10:04.72]I don't like fast travel.
[10:14.03]Walking is boring, I guess.
[10:18.17]Fast travel is more fun.
[10:19.15]We get more Jermamite content.
[10:25.23]Alright, it's in the community center.
[10:26.55]Let's get it.
[10:29.96]Turn my mic up?
[10:31.18]Yeah, what's going on with my mic lately?
[10:32.92]Hold on.
[10:36.73]Ever since... Let me look at this.
[10:45.82]Hold on.
[10:47.18]You tell me if it gets to be too bad.
[10:57.72]Bad?
[11:02.90]That's good, right?
[11:05.16]How's that?
[11:06.34]That's better, right?
[11:08.36]But once I scream, it's gonna be bad.
[11:10.06]Alright, no, that's fine.
[11:10.84]That's good.
[11:13.50]That's fine.
[11:13.92]That's better.
[11:15.87]I think that's better, yeah, that's better.
[11:17.65]Are these bad guys?
[11:18.83]They are.
[11:25.54]He's blind.
[11:27.82]Did I just shoot a blind guy?
[11:29.12]Uh oh.
[11:39.23]I just fucking missed three times.
[11:41.71]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[11:50.10]Oh, this is bad.
[12:00.11]Fuck.
[12:00.61]Okay, this is a lot harder than I thought it was gonna be.
[12:04.31]Did Jerma ever find a party member?
[12:05.83]Yes, and I told them to leave.
[12:15.98]Okay, so this is much more difficult than... I'm also playing it hard.
[12:22.14]And then some people are like, holy shit, this dude's on the story mode difficulty and he's losing.
[12:25.92]No, that's not what's happening.
[12:38.17]Let's sneak...
[12:44.38]Did they hit that screen?
[12:45.32]Alright, we're going to make it happen.
[12:54.64]I feel like... The way the guns work sometimes, it just feels like I'm... If I've been playing too much Dusk... Alright, I'm going to drop the set.
[13:07.09]You know what?
[13:07.37]I've been playing too much Dusk.
[13:14.75]I'm dead.
[13:19.01]I have the slow-mo.
[13:20.65]Alright, hold on.
[13:26.47]The guns in this are mostly lame.
[13:28.12]Let me look at this shit.
[13:31.94]What should I even use in here?
[13:33.10]Uh... Do these guns just suck?
[13:45.59]What the hell else do I have?
[13:48.55]Am I not high enough level to kill these guys?
[13:51.91]Or did I put too many points into lying to people?
[14:01.44]This thing is probably the best thing I have.
[14:03.98]No, it's the shotgun and the pistol.
[14:07.28]This thing actually really is not that good.
[14:08.68]Let me try this.
[14:19.46]This streamer is whack.
[14:35.76]No, it's not as good.
[14:44.32]What the fuck are you doing?
[14:46.54]Where are you going?
[14:47.37]What is happening right now?
[14:49.95]What?
[14:50.19]I gotta combine, uh... Jesus.
[15:14.51]What the fuck?
[15:17.61]Dude, does this gun have, does this gun hit people?
[15:20.23]How, it's a shotgun, what?
[15:32.61]Does it need to be repaired?
[15:38.15]How broken is this thing?
[15:43.33]It's not that broken, is it?
[15:47.88]Bolter pistol, we'll try this thing.
[15:53.75]Alright, well this is the first area of the whole game that it's been, like, hard for me to even get through it.
[15:57.87]This thing's almost broken too.
[16:02.31]Small, lightweight pistol.
[16:06.91]Just use the light machine gun and just fuckin' hold the button down?
[16:13.69]You know what?
[16:14.69]I have been playing too much Dusk.
[16:17.03]We're gonna drop the fucking... This by like... Down to like 8%.
[16:21.52]I'll do 9%.
[16:22.02]No, that's too much. 12.
[16:43.07]Alright, that's a little better.
[16:46.69]Now, let me try this.
[16:50.67]Shotguns are kind of bad.
[16:59.61]Are they?
[17:00.79]So it's not just me?
[17:02.01]The shotgun just, like, sucks in this game?
[17:05.01]Alright, let me... Let's do this tactically.
[17:29.78]Holy shit!
[17:30.94]What the fuck?
[17:33.44]Are these guys like level 20?
[17:35.67]Oh my god, I just pressed it.
[17:54.42]Oh my god.
[18:07.00]Okay, am I not supposed to be in here?
[18:19.91]Holy shit.
[18:23.94]I'm alone, I have no teammates, and they do so much damage.
[18:35.10]What the fuck is going on in this room?
[18:42.35]What?
[18:42.71]Give me my- give me this thing.
[19:12.80]It's kind of hard to stealth because I don't know anywhere they're facing and they can see you really easily.
[19:19.55]There's a guy right here.
[19:26.71]Is there an instant kill?
[19:30.22]My sneak- I don't have any sneak, I'm a fucking doctor!
[19:34.04]How do I instantly kill him from behind?
[19:43.29]It's giving me, where is it, where is it?
[19:45.15]Where's the book?
[19:49.85]Oh my god!
[19:51.23]Give me, give me, give me, give me!
[19:52.65]No, get it, pick it up!
[19:58.67]What is this?
[20:06.29]Fuck this place.
[20:10.03]Miss the fish lore?
[20:11.73]I don't care.
[20:19.67]Alright, I got one.
[20:20.99]Should I get them all?
[20:21.65]Is this that one person that told me, Jerma, you're gonna hate this because the handguns are terrible?
[20:31.28]Don't use handguns.
[20:35.41]Should I have listened to the one guy?
[20:52.14]No, I haven't saved it.
[20:53.18]I haven't saved the game.
[20:59.23]Where do I go?
[20:59.75]Where do I go?
[21:00.21]Where do I go?
[21:10.82]Okay.
[21:12.74]I'm at the other one.
[21:13.40]Save it.
[21:15.87]I need a workbench.
[21:16.70]I have to redo this guy's loadout.
[21:20.78]What is that?
[21:21.44]Who's talking?
[21:33.51]Okay.
[21:36.80]Electric sucks?
[21:41.58]Why does electric suck?
[21:43.35]Why does anything suck?
[21:44.97]Where's my choice to do what I want to do?
[21:47.21]What do you mean it sucks?
[21:49.63]Shotgun sucks.
[21:50.97]Shooting sucks.
[21:54.76]Am I being lied to?
[21:57.36]How do I get in here, though?
[21:58.20]Can I break this?
[22:05.48]That's very obviously electrified.
[22:06.74]I guess I can go in here.
[22:11.17]Alright, where's my electric?
[22:12.17]Alright, scientist.
[22:38.06]I thought that was me that died.
[22:39.20]I was like, how is that possible?
[22:42.29]Alright.
[22:44.71]So, Volume 3 is way, way easier to get than Volume 1.
[22:51.14]It's just right here.
[22:55.02]Let's go.
[23:01.19]Well, not quite, but it is still, it's right here.
[23:10.07]Turn the game volume up?
[23:11.03]Oh, actually, you're right.
[23:12.03]It should be higher.
[23:14.35]That's better.
[23:18.83]Okay.
[23:20.48]What do I have for ammo?
[23:21.22]Am I good?
[23:21.56]1900.
[23:27.74]It was just light ammo.
[23:29.78]Just buy it.
[23:33.91]Heavy ammo.
[23:37.33]Just buy it.
[23:40.77]Energy cell.
[23:41.45]Just buy it.
[23:45.51]Sawed-off shotgun.
[23:46.59]No.
[23:48.02]Wait, what?
[23:48.38]Revolver.
[23:54.78]Should I get this thing?
[23:57.98]I don't have a revolver.
[24:03.02]I have a bolt pistol.
[24:07.43]How much is it?
[24:12.95]Just get it.
[24:13.65]Whatever.
[24:14.33]Alright, let me look at it.
[24:15.61]It's alright.
[24:16.07]Alright, let's try it.
[24:19.19]Revolver.
[24:27.03]Ooh.
[24:27.54]Actually, I like this thing.
[24:30.54]I've actually really liked this.
[24:33.50]It's not the best choice, but it is a choice.
[24:36.12]So we're gonna use it.
[24:39.84]Exo helmet.
[24:43.28]I have so much random shit that I need to go to, like, town after I do this.
[24:46.62]I've already read these.
[24:50.72]I think I've already been down here.
[25:01.88]Yeah, I've already did all this.
[25:03.16]This guy's friendly.
[25:10.08]Good thing I cleared this whole thing.
[25:11.28]I can just run down here and get it.
[25:26.02]Wait, where is it?
[25:26.80]Further down?
[25:27.72]Okay.
[25:34.26]Oh, this guy's still down here.
[25:35.32]Does he care if I take his book?
[25:41.52]Model spaceship.
[25:46.11]I got two.
[25:49.73]Don't kill this guy.
[25:50.65]Why would I kill him?
[25:51.43]I don't have a reason to kill this guy.
[26:01.52]Not yet, at least.
[26:02.24]Alright, volume two is... Should I just fast travel out of here?
[26:09.20]Can I?
[26:15.51]No.
[26:19.27]He doesn't have any morals.
[26:24.00]Uh... Yeah, I do.
[26:25.70]Because I... I didn't kill that guy.
[26:29.08]If I had no morals, I would just be like, Watch this chat!
[26:36.86]That means I have morals.
[26:38.02]That means I chose not to shoot that guy.
[26:42.20]Therefore, I have morals.
[26:49.15]Is the other one just in here?
[26:52.97]Wait a minute.
[26:55.21]The other vault?
[26:55.91]No.
[27:01.26]That's just called not being insane.
[27:03.78]Yeah, I also said don't smoke cigarettes.
[27:05.64]You weren't here for that.
[27:06.32]That's pre-stream chat.
[27:09.84]I said don't vape and don't smoke cigarettes.
[27:12.31]Especially don't vape.
[27:13.17]Because vaping is just cigarettes you can smoke inside.
[27:19.66]And you can just do it a hundred times more than you do cigarettes.
[27:25.75]And then I went off on a whole thing about how all the advertisements are like, it's water vapor.
[27:30.45]It's clean, clear water.
[27:32.89]Water vapor.
[27:35.47]But you'll be taking in 50 times more nicotine because you're going to hit this fucking thing all day.
[27:41.06]But it's vapor.
[27:41.96]Clean, clear water vapor vapor.
[27:49.06]Turn up the volume, dummy.
[27:50.98]I did.
[27:54.17]I increased it by like 5,000%.
[27:55.77]Our branch of vapor juice is the cleanest, clearest water.
[28:24.41]I can only hear gun sounds.
[28:28.32]That's called audio design, not me.
[28:32.66]You mean like you can only hear this?
[28:35.90]Well, how do I fix that?
[28:39.53]Audio?
[28:40.95]Effects?
[28:41.91]Music?
[28:43.11]There's only effects and voice.
[28:49.57]Turn effects down?
[28:50.44]Turn the master up?
[29:03.17]Okay.
[29:04.43]Now.
[29:05.51]Volume 2.
[29:11.17]Just play Chill Step.
[29:12.48]Not a bad idea.
[29:18.63]Alright, let's go.
[29:19.49]Up.
[29:21.09]Wait.
[29:22.01]No, I went the wrong way.
[29:22.90]Up.
[29:23.12]No, go back down.
[29:29.08]Can I get out of him?
[29:32.98]Who let the toddler in the elevator?
[29:35.22]He's just pressing buttons.
[29:36.49]There you go.
[29:43.89]Oh, come on.
[29:44.51]Which one of these is it in?
[29:51.54]Alright, I got them all.
[29:59.01]Can he see me do this?
[30:04.41]Yeah, whatever.
[30:04.83]Fucking corporations.
[30:06.59]Okay, let's go back in the elevator and get out of here.
[30:25.18]Anarchy.
[30:26.82]That's not anarchy.
[30:38.41]No mortals.
[30:42.80]Omegalo... Omegalo-archy?
[30:49.60]Or-anarchy?
[30:50.68]That's not even, there's no A there.
[30:52.22]That's not correct.
[30:55.73]You can have fast travel near hostiles.
[30:57.55]Who's a hostile?
[31:01.75]Is somebody just hanging out in one of these buildings?
[31:03.13]I don't see anybody.
[31:05.69]Oops.
[31:17.20]Am I away from hostiles now?
[31:20.54]I am.
[31:25.80]Let's turn this in and then let's tell everybody to leave.
[31:32.58]I did all your tasks.
[31:34.20]Now go back to Edgewater.
[31:36.44]We're going to go take it over.
[31:37.80]I got all three of them.
[31:39.68]Uh... Which one do I give them?
[31:56.29]Found it in the community center.
[31:57.56]The elusive part three.
[31:59.26]Someone stashed it away inside the old geomotor.
[32:01.30]Should I give him the elusive part three?
[32:05.40]It was.
[32:05.86]Until I went down there.
[32:20.48]Hey, it's your lucky day.
[32:21.50]Hold on.
[32:21.78]I got more for you.
[32:22.52]I got another one.
[32:24.13]Here, take part two.
[32:25.53]What was it?
[32:54.03]You've gained 500 bits.
[32:56.53]Thanks for the $5.
[32:57.37]Last one.
[32:58.71]Don't keep me in suspense.
[33:02.27]Look at that.
[33:02.75]So what do you get for all three?
[33:03.99]Building a computing machine out of Spectrum potatoes, a primer.
[33:08.80]I'm just glad it survived all these years.
[33:11.86]That's a complete set.
[33:13.70]All three parts.
[33:15.52]I'm gonna be the greatest engineer Halcyon's ever seen.
[33:18.86]4,000 experience?
[33:19.64]Ooh.
[33:19.84]Contraption.
[33:20.24]What is it?
[33:20.64]What is it?
[33:21.00]Hurry up.
[33:21.34]Electro-charged surface.
[33:34.03]What's on your mind?
[33:37.44]Couple months.
[33:38.20]This camp's my home.
[33:40.38]People you see milling about?
[33:42.02]They're my family.
[33:42.78]At least I think of them that way.
[33:45.98]I owe them my life.
[33:47.46]Would have died in the wilderness if they hadn't chanced upon me, starving and delirious.
[33:51.54]Alright, so now I've done everything.
[33:53.16]Alright, well, cool.
[33:54.20]You can tell somebody else.
[33:55.82]Alright, I've done it.
[33:57.64]So now... Comes now the power.
[34:01.00]Return to Adelaide.
[34:02.10]Reed has been removed from Edgewater.
[34:03.54]Return to Adelaide and tell her the news.
[34:08.07]So, we're ready.
[34:14.25]To kill Adelaide.
[34:16.97]That was the... The plan was... I know, but that's like... Anarchy!
[34:21.91]I don't think I want to do that.
[34:23.29]Hold on, let me see what happens.
[34:25.51]The plan was to bring everybody back to Edgewater and then kill her.
[34:31.24]But then, wouldn't I just be... I would be just enemy number one.
[34:36.82]Let's see.
[34:38.88]Call me a snake again.
[34:45.27]Reed's dead.
[34:47.07]Come back to Edgewater.
[34:48.25]Yeah.
[35:01.23]We must tend to what remains of the town and carry on with our lives as best we may.
[35:07.57]So who runs the town now?
[35:08.35]Ransom?
[35:08.55]You just gave me your watch for ransom for you?
[35:29.72]You know, it's better off with you running the place.
[35:31.77]You're telling me you did all this just to put me in charge of Edgewater.
[35:36.01]Stranger, you are some kind of twisty.
[35:39.19]I might turn that old cannery into a garden.
[35:41.21]I'm gonna wait till she sits down in the throne and then kill her instantly.
[35:47.73]Long walk back to Edgewater.
[35:49.37]You had a considerable burden to carry.
[35:51.91]And then hopefully somebody else is ready.
[35:53.68]Like, oh wait, I could run the place.
[35:57.35]Yeah, I bet you could.
[35:58.07]Why don't you give it a try?
[36:01.91]Sitting in the mayor chair is the trigger for me to shoot them.
[36:10.55]Take care now.
[36:11.86]I'll see you later.
[36:18.02]There can be no ruler.
[36:20.92]Everyone who tries gets the boot.
[36:26.86]I just spilled coffee all over my fucking whole body.
[36:28.86]Whatever.
[36:29.66]I'm not moving.
[36:31.38]Alright, so they're making their way back to Edgewater.
[36:39.55]Now, get the power regulator.
[36:42.19]Give it to me.
[36:53.37]What would happen?
[36:54.15]I don't even know.
[37:01.55]Regulator Return to the unreliable I did it
[37:40.15]Let's go.
[37:43.67]So that's it.
[37:44.17]Alright, we're good.
[37:46.73]She's still alive, right?
[37:47.97]Okay.
[37:49.74]I told you, what I do appreciate about this game, you can say it might be a little more limited, whatever, right?
[37:54.90]But one really important thing to remember about this game is most NPCs die in one hit.
[38:03.52]Remember when you used to play Fallout and you'd fight an NPC and all of a sudden it would just be like a boss fight?
[38:13.23]People die pretty quick.
[38:17.07]Okay, so now I gotta go back to the... uh... landing site.
[38:26.64]Let's continue.
[38:29.88]Bastard.
[38:30.58]Bastard.
[38:31.94]Look at him go, bastard.
[38:35.32]alright let's do it well I certainly am looking forward to flying on a ship I'll just head upstairs and claim a room
[39:00.57]Is this a hologram?
[39:01.31]This is a projection.
[39:02.13]He's not actually here.
[39:03.58]He's like... Spoiler.
[39:06.42]For a very large movie franchise.
[39:13.91]That's not gonna come back and bite me in the ass later, right?
[39:18.05]Like, in an hour, he's not gonna instantly take all that stored up damage and die.
[39:22.15]Right?
[39:22.81]Like, he's not gonna be mad at me or something?
[39:29.40]Okay, well, we got Max.
[39:30.70]We're good.
[39:30.96]Mm-hmm.
[39:31.24]I've got your power core.
[39:34.28]We can get out of here.
[39:35.26]No idea.
[39:35.46]Yes, I do.
[39:52.84]Outstanding, Captain.
[39:54.22]Your aptitude for engineering will prove invaluable in the event of another catastrophic engine failure.
[40:00.41]Our engine room is located behind you, across the cargo bay, up the ladders.
[40:07.79]Okay.
[40:16.50]Dumb engineer.
[40:17.48]Dumb doctor.
[40:18.44]Dumb everything.
[40:20.16]Dumb liar.
[40:22.40]But you can't be all of these things if you're stupid.
[40:25.44]It doesn't make any sense.
[40:27.44]If you pick the dumb trait, then you shouldn't be able to be, like, a scientist or a doctor.
[40:36.07]It's a living oxymoron.
[40:37.61]Like, how did I pass medical school if I can't even, like, read?
[40:46.89]That makes no sense.
[40:49.11]If I can't read, how did you pass med school?
[40:53.15]Alright, it's on.
[40:53.59]Dumb luck.
[40:53.91]Hold on.
[40:54.11]Do I need to clean something up here?
[40:56.93]Let's see.
[40:57.23]Side quest.
[40:57.59]Retrieve the cache of medicine.
[40:58.85]Abernathy believes he's dying.
[41:00.43]Well, didn't I already kill him?
[41:28.17]I mean, I already... I'm pretty sure I already sentenced him to death.
[41:36.39]Yeah, let's go.
[41:37.96]He's dead.
[41:39.92]I, like, told on him and shit, and, like, the guard now knows everything about it.
[41:45.26]Back to the community center.
[41:46.44]No, no, he's dead.
[41:49.64]Can't save everybody.
[41:51.02]I know, not like I've been trying to save anybody.
[41:59.40]Can't save everybody.
[42:00.36]Just accidentally killed like four people.
[42:02.91]And destroyed a whole town.
[42:04.45]Whatever.
[42:05.11]Can't save everybody.
[42:29.99]A communication request from Dr. Phidias Wells.
[42:33.11]PogChamps in the chat over that.
[42:34.99]It's just like a ship taking off.
[42:40.74]I love that so much.
[42:47.44]Aha, there you are.
[42:48.73]Hail and hearty and captain of your own ship.
[42:52.17]I see you're putting the unreliable to good use.
[42:55.05]Shame about her former captain.
[42:56.35]Horrible way to die.
[42:58.48]How are you feeling, by the way?
[42:59.65]You look like that guy that's in the basement of the geothermal plant.
[43:02.35]Experiencing any unnatural drippage?
[43:04.97]Perfectly normal side effect of thawing, I assure you.
[43:10.77]Alright, I'll get to the point.
[43:12.32]What you saw in Emerald Vale is happening all across the colony.
[43:16.36]Food shortages, lack of supplies, and basic necessities.
[43:20.40]We are dying.
[43:21.82]The chairman, the minister, and all their lackeys on the board are to blame.
[43:26.34]The Hope has some of the brightest minds Earth ever sent us.
[43:29.61]If we can revive the Hope's colonists, they can help us undo the Board's mistakes.
[43:34.79]They can help us set things right.
[43:37.72]You need to get to Stellar Bay on Monarch.
[43:40.30]I have contacts there.
[43:41.34]They'll help me.
[43:42.84]Help us.
[43:43.94]Find the chemicals to revive your fellow colonists.
[43:47.26]I feel like if you're this quiet, you're doing that face too.
[43:49.18]Like, that's what you're doing.
[43:50.00]Runs a cozy little black marketing outfit on the Groundbreaker.
[43:53.70]She can get you a nav key to land on Stellar Bay.
[43:56.54]Okay, you cannot travel to Phineas' lab.
[43:58.23]Okay.
[43:59.99]I'll go have a word with Gladys.
[44:01.43]Why do I need a nav key to land on a planet?
[44:04.15]Slow down, you're asking me to get involved with the black market.
[44:07.43]or I could put a couple light years between me and I could just leave um I could I'll go have a word excellent I'll send her a wireless let her know you're coming by the way I gave captain hawthorne a disguise apparatus of my own design cutting edge technology years ahead of its time
[44:33.67]I call it the holographic shroud I'm sure it will prove remarkably useful to you you'll find it in the captain's quarters wait I can put on a disguise I'm going to wear a cape matter of shroud my slow-witted accomplice this is a how to put it simply a device that makes you look different sound different briefly
[44:56.33]The device has its limits, but it will allow you to blend in perfectly and probably won't jeopardize your ability to have children.
[45:04.14]Will it?
[45:04.98]No, definitely not.
[45:06.58]Probably, yes.
[45:08.58]Very simply, the holographic shroud uses biometric information contained on standard identity cartridges to generate a holographic projection around you.
[45:19.92]Okay.
[45:20.96]What are the limitations?
[45:21.68]Movement?
[45:21.90]Well, this is gonna be horrible.
[45:22.90]No running, no jumping?
[45:24.38]What do you mean I can't run?
[45:54.12]A change of clothes.
[45:55.86]What is this, some old spy serial?
[45:58.66]What inattentive and brainless god would be fooled by such a shabby disguise?
[46:04.92]The holographic shroud masks not only your clothes, but your face and fingerprints.
[46:10.54]It modulates your voice and sweetens your breath.
[46:14.92]okay I'll put it to good use excellent I'll contact you once you've found a way to get to stellar bay if you have any questions come see me in my lab
[46:25.22]Is it?
[46:25.34]I know that very well.
[46:26.10]Liars versus liars.
[46:26.70]Got it.
[46:52.27]okay so uh can I just open the hatch and just fly out no I don't know why I even asked that question alright holographic shroud there it is
[47:10.15]Projects a disguise on you and your companions that gives you access to restricted areas, provided you have the correct ID cartridge for that area.
[47:17.75]Restricted areas are off-limits to unauthorized personnel and otherwise result in being attacked on sight.
[47:23.38]Well, that sucks.
[47:30.58]Reed's... Did I bring Reed's skull?
[47:34.74]Did I take this guy's head?
[47:43.74]What the hell?
[47:46.96]That's a little fucked up.
[47:48.16]Alright, what do I got?
[47:50.36]Uh, bin.
[47:52.24]Let me see.
[47:52.80]I need a workbench.
[47:56.41]Where's the nearest workbench?
[47:58.47]Shh!
[48:04.85]Who's this?
[48:09.02]Sam.
[48:10.12]Okay.
[48:16.25]Workbench.
[48:18.63]Am I stealing?
[48:30.76]This is not like somebody else's room, right?
[48:33.80]A stern older man with warm eyes.
[48:41.58]There he is!
[48:45.42]Tarot cards?
[48:49.27]Tarot cards, okay.
[48:51.53]Don't want to see the Ten of Swords.
[48:54.05]Especially when it's the right way up.
[49:06.17]That's real, but that's real.
[49:10.07]You guys can mine this to all you want.
[49:11.71]That's actually real.
[49:13.19]If you see the Ten of Swords in a region.
[49:17.75]What, none of you guys understand tarot readings?
[49:26.37]I bet you.
[49:26.99]There are almost 2,600 people here.
[49:29.62]I bet you maybe one or two of you have ever had a reading.
[49:33.78]I've never had a reading before.
[49:35.62]Has anybody in here actually done it?
[49:37.66]Maybe four of you?
[49:39.58]So that reference was for four of you.
[49:47.47]What, you guys don't like sit on the toilet and like read about tarot cards?
[49:53.23]It's... what?
[49:54.85]Just because you're just like, oh, I wonder what that's all about, and you just read about it?
[50:05.92]I do that, but not... No... I must... I must be a fucking hundred years old.
[50:12.20]You guys don't read shit on the toilet?
[50:16.44]What?! !
[50:24.67]Oh, you go on Twitter.
[50:25.93]Oh, right.
[50:26.41]You scroll through Twitter.
[50:29.20]Oh, I forgot.
[50:30.52]I forgot about social media.
[50:33.80]God.
[50:34.26]You guys should be reading about tarot cards.
[50:48.37]And, like, how much water pressure happens when you go a mile underwater.
[50:54.07]You don't read that?
[50:54.67]I don't understand why.
[50:56.23]Alright, let's go to... This is where I am.
[51:05.17]Terror 2.
[51:05.83]I can go a lot of different places, can't I?
[51:11.89]This is a whole solar system.
[51:12.67]This is awesome.
[51:14.16]Welcome to the system map.
[51:15.10]Here you can see all the planets in the system as well as some special points of interest.
[51:19.39]You can fly your ship to any location you've unlocked.
[51:21.17]There's some landing bays require special codes and keys before they allow you to land.
[51:26.93]Moving between planets is considered extremely dangerous.
[51:29.84]Okay.
[51:30.00]Alright.
[51:33.26]Passage to anywhere.
[51:34.38]Speak to Gladys on the ground breaker.
[51:45.03]Groundbreaker.
[51:52.61]Let's go.
[51:55.92]So I've been beamed onto their ship?
[51:58.96]First of all, let me do this.
[51:59.72]Alright, we need to do... Done.
[52:12.30]okay so now I am impossible to I'm a dialogue master get some new clothes I will hold on I'm a 50 liar perks what do I got journal oh alright you have a sawed-off shotgun and a scope that doesn't look right in your hands it seems weird
[52:42.55]Uh, I'm gonna give you this.
[52:46.65]That's probably better use for you.
[52:50.04]Hey, don't aim that at me.
[52:51.30]What the fuck?
[52:51.82]Are you stupid?
[52:54.04]Alright, uh, let's go back.
[52:57.40]You sure could.
[53:01.15]What are we contemplating today?
[53:09.60]Alright, we have to go back and forth here with Max.
[53:11.30]Alright, I'd like to know something about those I'm flying with.
[53:14.47]What's your story?
[53:15.75]You're the only one on the ship.
[53:19.45]Any ideas where we can find someone who speaks French in this colony?
[53:22.27]I've been thinking on that.
[53:23.81]There's a former... That's what we care about?
[53:26.02]...infamous philosopher scholar who fled Terra II some years ago.
[53:30.08]He's an expert on Bokonu.
[53:32.36]He's also who told me of the journal's presence in Emerald Vale.
[53:35.80]If anyone in this colony could translate that book, it would be him.
[53:41.45]Seriously?
[53:41.87]The one guy in this whole colony?
[53:43.51]Talk to computer.
[53:44.98]Get Sam.
[53:45.28]Talk to computer.
[53:45.86]No, I want this guy.
[53:57.18]Your sarcasm is dearly noted and will be reflected on your review.
[54:00.22]A thousand pardons, my good captain.
[54:02.72]I thought we were engaging in witty repartee.
[54:06.45]We want Sam and Max.
[54:09.83]We should start on the groundbreaker.
[54:12.37]Yeah, they're in the game.
[54:13.65]They're the only two people that are going to be on my ship.
[54:16.13]Even monarch.
[54:18.35]Are you gonna have two at once?
[54:19.47]Hold on, I can have Sam and Max.
[54:21.23]What?
[54:21.35]Let's do it.
[54:21.75]Alright, how will a crew manifest help us to track down your scholar friend?
[54:23.97]Okay.
[54:24.09]Thank you, Captain.
[54:48.80]Alright, let's get Sam.
[54:52.20]Welcome back, Captain.
[54:54.08]How can I be of assistance?
[54:55.64]I would like you.
[54:58.26]You know anything about the auto-mechanical gathering dust in the janitor closet?
[55:01.16]It is a cleaning, Sam.
[55:03.04]Hawthorne brought it on board some cycles ago, I'm sure with the intent to modify it.
[55:07.72]But I've never seen it up and running.
[55:09.92]Alex likely recorded progress notes detailing his efforts to modify Sam.
[55:14.89]If you check the terminal in your captain's quarters, we may be able to determine what work remains in order for Sam to properly operate.
[55:21.61]Another quest to get Sam and Max.
[55:24.99]Okay.
[55:25.83]I'm in the mood for some entertainment.
[55:27.87]Certainly, Captain.
[55:29.39]What would you like to hear?
[55:34.30]Tell me a joke.
[55:35.78]I used to hate math, but then I realized decimals have a point.
[55:43.82]Now playing a Spacer's Choice advertisement jingle.
[55:46.81]It's not the best choice.
[55:51.05]It's Spacer's Choice.
[55:54.21]It's not my favorite song.
[55:55.15]Everyone in Halcyon is contractually obligated to label this or another board-certified jingle their favorite song.
[56:02.91]Let me fix that up for you.
[56:05.43]Now playing a Spacer's Choice advertisement jingle.
[56:15.50]Oh, beatbox!
[56:16.12]He beatboxed!
[56:16.66]Oh, beatbox!
[56:17.06]He beatboxed!
[56:17.50]I'm free!
[56:18.12]My pleasure, Captain.
[56:21.12]As you wish, Captain.
[56:22.97]I must comply with all direct orders.
[56:29.31]Alright, let's go.
[56:29.83]I'll be here.
[56:30.49]Alright, now, let me look.
[56:38.69]Uh, the Empty Man.
[56:40.69]The Cleaning Machine.
[56:41.99]Alright, search Hawthorne's Terminal.
[56:45.72]Let's figure it out.
[56:55.75]Cool.
[56:56.19]Alright.
[56:58.59]Good to know.
[57:00.01]Alright, let's repair... What is this?
[57:02.73]A revolver?
[57:03.85]Yeah.
[57:07.73]Is this a shock pistol?
[57:12.41]Yeah, I still don't need it.
[57:14.45]How's this doing?
[57:16.25]It's fine.
[57:18.72]How's this doing?
[57:20.30]Eh, it's alright.
[57:21.30]This needs to be repaired.
[57:22.48]Yeah.
[57:25.76]Okay.
[57:26.04]Why does it have a diamond on it?
[57:30.86]Hunting rifle.
[57:31.58]What's that diamond mean?
[57:35.74]Tinker.
[57:36.36]Let's see.
[57:36.86]I want to make this a little better.
[57:40.63]Revolver damage...
[57:42.09]Is it stupid for me to... I mean, it's only $50.
[57:44.83]That's not bad.
[57:53.53]It's $102.
[57:53.71]$110.
[57:53.85]Do it again.
[58:07.10]I want to make this useful.
[58:08.70]One more time.
[58:11.03]Okay.
[58:12.03]That's it.
[58:13.02]Now we're getting to $600.
[58:14.98]128 DPS for the pistols.
[58:17.42]Pretty damn good.
[58:22.04]Alright.
[58:22.30]Tinker.
[58:23.44]With the hunting rifle.
[58:26.95]58 DPS.
[58:27.55]100.
[58:33.05]No.
[58:33.89]What else can I do?
[58:34.91]Light machine gun.
[58:36.85]Always just do at least the first or second tier of these.
[58:39.03]Because why not?
[58:44.50]This thing's going to be useful now.
[58:47.66]Alright, now let's break this shit down.
[58:51.16]Keep the shovel.
[58:52.58]Get rid of this guy's staff.
[58:54.29]Alright, what is it?
[58:55.77]No, not tinker.
[58:56.51]We need to modify.
[58:57.57]No, we need to break down.
[58:58.61]Okay.
[59:00.95]Break this down.
[59:04.01]Wait, wait, wait.
[59:04.81]Hold on.
[59:05.97]Okay, that's not equipped, right?
[59:10.27]I just destroyed something that was diamond on it.
[59:12.59]Oops.
[59:12.69]Who cares?
[59:13.53]Who cares?
[59:16.08]This is one-handed.
[59:20.48]This thing is just worse.
[59:22.42]This is both one-handed.
[59:23.43]No, it's not.
[59:24.93]Fuck it.
[59:25.23]Who cares?
[59:28.79]Oh, shit.
[59:29.29]Alright.
[59:29.59]I need to modify, modify, modify.
[59:32.43]What can we do with this?
[59:33.73]With the revolver?
[59:36.09]No modifications I have for the revolver?
[59:43.23]No scopes?
[59:44.59]No nothing?
[59:45.99]How?
[59:47.01]Light machine gun.
[59:47.95]Nothing.
[59:49.67]The pistol.
[59:50.69]Nothing.
[59:52.03]What about armor?
[59:57.66]There we go.
[59:58.44]Electro-charged surface.
[60:00.46]Thug kit.
[60:04.32]Alright, let me look at what I even have for... I have a lot of random shit here.
[60:09.59]This thing is tech skills.
[60:11.71]It's 5 armor.
[60:12.47]What else do I have?
[60:14.05]Lab outfit.
[60:17.97]I kind of like it.
[60:19.35]I do kind of like it.
[60:24.25]Patched low pressure helmet.
[60:29.41]Mining gear.
[60:30.33]This is stealth.
[60:31.23]No.
[60:31.91]Holy shit.
[60:34.57]17 armor.
[60:36.09]It's heavy armor though.
[60:37.59]It weighs a lot.
[60:39.52]No, it doesn't.
[60:43.52]Spacer's choice outfit.
[60:45.26]Melee weapon skills.
[60:47.28]Sneak.
[60:49.13]One-handed melee plus five.
[60:50.79]That's actually pretty good, but I'm going to keep this on.
[60:52.99]I like this weird doctor look.
[60:59.21]Yeah.
[61:00.05]That looks alright.
[61:04.59]Wear the hat.
[61:08.03]Oh yeah, dialogue skill plus seven.
[61:11.49]That's true.
[61:13.75]Alright, what do you got on for armor?
[61:15.93]This.
[61:18.99]Give me this.
[61:21.91]I'm putting that on.
[61:24.70]Your claws.
[61:25.94]Give them to me.
[61:26.54]Alright, now you can put on the doctor outfit.
[61:39.52]Let's just trade.
[61:40.26]Alright, we're gonna trade.
[61:41.44]You're gonna be me and I'm gonna be you.
[61:43.49]You get to be the doctor.
[61:51.11]I get to be the priest.
[61:52.87]Do we have two hats?
[61:58.14]I think that's fine.
[61:59.82]This is where I have to actually pay attention.
[62:01.56]So, this is the heal.
[62:03.24]Heals 25% health over two seconds.
[62:07.70]Uh, plus 200% natural health regeneration for two minutes.
[62:12.97]So I can combine these.
[62:13.95]That's pretty cool.
[62:19.81]Let's do, what do I have a lot of?
[62:24.06]That's like headshot damage.
[62:25.52]Can I just do two of these?
[62:26.70]Can I do like a double dose?
[62:31.58]No.
[62:33.88]Uh, we'll just do the, uh, we'll do the spinel.
[62:38.55]Do matching hats.
[62:45.01]Fine.
[62:47.47]You have perks, though.
[62:48.37]Alright.
[62:49.25]Base health threat generated.
[62:50.85]Increase your hack skill.
[62:57.61]I don't want to generate that much threat.
[63:06.21]Maybe the hack skill...
[63:09.37]But I'm not going to really use it.
[63:12.07]I mean, it is just a free hack skill.
[63:16.13]That's true.
[63:19.37]Or health.
[63:21.15]Or... It's either health or hack.
[63:32.91]Because I don't want you to generate threat.
[63:34.75]You'll just die instantly.
[63:38.74]But I don't want you to not generate threat, because I don't want to take all the hits.
[63:41.42]But we're going to get Sam.
[63:42.36]It's a free hack skill.
[63:49.48]I'm taking it.
[63:55.06]Plus 20% dialogue combat effective melee damage, armor rating, range damage.
[64:00.86]Free hack skill.
[64:01.42]Alright.
[64:06.72]Looking good.
[64:07.71]I've got my stuff sorted.
[64:09.53]Let me just go to my weapons, make sure this is all correct.
[64:11.79]Where's my revolver?
[64:13.99]There it is.
[64:14.43]This is the one that I'm going to use.
[64:15.65]I've upgraded this a lot.
[64:17.47]This thing's alright.
[64:18.33]This thing's okay.
[64:19.68]They're all alright.
[64:20.46]Alright, looking good.
[64:27.08]Can you tinker your armor?
[64:31.04]Can I upgrade the armor?
[64:32.63]Shit, I can.
[64:33.29]Okay.
[64:35.63]So I'm going to upgrade his robes.
[64:40.09]Alright.
[64:41.13]And upgrade the hat too.
[64:48.10]One more time.
[64:51.72]Why did that not go up?
[65:00.80]Alright, I'm going to break down one of these.
[65:04.39]Probably the shock one.
[65:05.85]No, this one.
[65:08.83]Do I even want the assault rifle?
[65:10.55]Fuck it, I don't want it.
[65:13.01]What about this junk?
[65:16.09]Mining gear.
[65:16.88]I feel like I could use this, but I don't want to be weighed down.
[65:21.38]Tech skills.
[65:24.02]No.
[65:24.26]This is worker's outfit.
[65:27.22]Melee weapon skills.
[65:28.70]I mean, I don't care.
[65:32.61]Sneak plus 5, I'm never going to be sneaking around.
[65:37.19]One-handed melee, maybe.
[65:38.83]Mining gear, I'm not going to be sneaking around.
[65:43.64]This thing is a diamond, so I'm not going to get rid of it.
[65:46.52]Stealth skills, get rid of the damn thing.
[65:49.40]Tech skills, maybe, but not really.
[65:51.56]Get rid of the damn thing.
[65:54.08]I'm being weighed down by... Alright, that's fine.
[65:57.74]Alright.
[66:00.29]I'm ready.
[66:04.21]Let's do this.
[66:11.91]What was I doing?
[66:12.93]I forget.
[66:13.63]I was gonna go over here, yeah.
[66:14.85]To do- to activate Sam.
[66:21.20]Search term SAM.
[66:23.40]First SAM result.
[66:24.76]Do not forget you found a discarded sanitation and maintenance auto-mechanical in Emerald Vale scrap heap during your last job.
[66:31.35]It should not be too difficult to get it up and running.
[66:33.31]With a few key modifications, I can envision a combat-capable variant.
[66:37.18]Some might say a clean, mean killing machine.
[66:39.78]Should be fun.
[66:41.69]Uh, removal of factory standard part Suds Steeper with successful delivery of combat modified replacement part Acid Steeper has been deployed.
[66:49.43]Progress setback is estimated to be a solid three months.
[66:52.37]Not like I have more pressing matters to attend to, but I do.
[66:56.68]I'm giving up hope on the delivery.
[66:58.74]The part is lost in transit.
[67:00.28]It's not turning up anytime soon.
[67:02.40]But good news.
[67:03.14]I heard from a fellow who knows a gal who knows the broker who overcharged me for the information regarding the location of an acid steeper.
[67:09.97]I can filch.
[67:12.99]The part was sent to an old storage facility in Rose Way.
[67:16.07]The rest of the stuff, you could have just went like this and hit delete because that's all I need to know.
[67:23.11]It's abandoned.
[67:24.45]Good.
[67:32.83]Cleaning machine.
[67:33.35]Let's get it.
[67:33.73]Find the acid steeper.
[67:34.65]Let's do that.
[67:35.25]I'm into that right now.
[67:36.61]I want two companions.
[67:40.35]That just freaked me out.
[67:41.47]I forgot you're the doctor now.
[67:43.28]And I'm the priest.
[67:45.36]So I'm going to make sure you have all the medical stuff.
[67:53.70]Okay.
[67:54.35]Where is this thing?
[67:55.39]Hmm.
[67:57.97]I don't have access to Rose Way yet, huh?
[67:58.93]Well, shit.
[67:59.15]Okay.
[68:26.08]So Roseway is not accessible, so we can't do that yet.
[68:28.78]So we're just gonna go to... Just gonna go to where we were going before.
[68:38.30]Oh, alright.
[68:38.64]Okay.
[68:38.84]Let's have a meeting.
[68:39.64]Party select?
[68:57.30]Just you.
[69:00.77]It's just you.
[69:02.53]So right now this actor is reading the script for what's coming up.
[69:06.51]And he's not happy about it.
[69:07.87]He's like, wait, they made changes?
[69:10.57]I have to be the fucking doctor now?
[69:13.05]Ah, that seems a little... Well, you're the director, I guess.
[69:17.16]Okay.
[69:20.02]I thought I was hired to be the priest, but...
[69:29.49]Alright, let's go.
[69:33.14]Smells like grease and unwashed bodies.
[69:36.22]Just as I remembered.
[69:38.58]That's not the point.
[69:39.70]This hat was just knocked out by one of my workers.
[69:43.04]Yeah, with a tossball stick.
[69:44.44]I heard you the first time.
[69:46.07]There weren't any witnesses.
[69:48.29]No witnesses?
[69:49.31]He's not even denying it.
[69:50.53]No witnesses!
[69:51.63]Jackass had it coming.
[69:53.17]Sorry.
[69:53.67]Shut it, Felix.
[69:54.75]Hi, I am interrupting you.
[69:56.75]If you could move along, I'd be obliged.
[69:59.60]Are you head backwards?
[70:00.20]Does this head 180 degrees turn like broken neck?
[70:02.34]You look like you got enough problems.
[70:05.28]Mind if I have a word with the kid?
[70:07.86]Oh.
[70:28.19]Whatever you heard, it's all true.
[70:33.81]I heard you knock somebody out with a tossball stick.
[70:35.89]The guy insulted my Rizzo's rangers, alright?
[70:38.43]You can't just insult my rangers and expect to get away with it.
[70:41.54]What's Rizzo's rangers?
[70:42.72]So of course I decked him with a tossball stick.
[70:45.28]I mean, what am I?
[70:46.30]Some kind of fair weather fan?
[70:47.54]Did he make fun of your Pokémon card deck choices?
[70:51.18]So you hit him with a stick?
[70:53.61]That's overreaction.
[70:54.55]You wouldn't be saying that if you'd been there.
[70:57.12]guy never liked me always trying to get a rise out of me but I keep my chin up right be the bigger man I tell myself he's a spacers chosen man though so when the chosen beat my rangers the other night my foreman comes swaggering up with his head full of boasting oh boy oh and that's when you resolve your differences like an adult right that's when I broadsided him with a toss ball stick yeah
[71:23.70]Look, this was a long time coming.
[71:25.42]Guy thinks he can push me around because he's some sky-high foreman, and I'm just a back-based dock worker.
[71:31.59]Well, former dock worker.
[71:34.07]Guess I just tendered my resignation.
[71:39.75]Yeah, you're lucky you're not serving a sentence.
[71:40.97]You know something?
[71:42.07]I am lucky.
[71:43.31]I ought to raise a glass of Zero-G to my fortune, if I had the bits.
[71:47.73]Hey, not for nothing, but I saw you wander out of that ship over there by the dock.
[71:52.64]What does my ship have to do with you?
[71:55.28]That's... That's me, Captain of the Unreliable.
[72:02.17]Please don't hit me with a stick.
[72:04.23]Boss.
[72:24.58]Hey, what do you make of this guy?
[72:27.18]I find myself marveling at the complex simplicity of the Fibonacci spiral.
[72:31.88]I'm sure you know what that's like.
[72:34.34]He's gone.
[72:34.88]Let's talk about the thing.
[72:38.91]You know, that thing with the thing that you want to do.
[72:42.09]Yes, well, now that we're here, can we check in with security?
[72:45.17]I'd like to track down that scholar.
[72:48.79]That's the plan.
[72:49.43]Okay.
[72:54.88]Alright, let's have the conversation with the lattice.
[72:58.36]Customs and inspection, right this way!
[73:03.32]Identification, please.
[73:04.24]Uh-oh.
[73:04.88]Do I have... Wait!
[73:09.08]I don't have the... Do I have the thing on?
[73:10.38]I don't think I turned on the cloaking device.
[73:16.44]You're guarding the door.
[73:17.20]I'll call you guard.
[73:18.08]You're welcome.
[73:19.28]That's only about the third or fourth dumbest line I've heard all day.
[73:22.76]I give it a six out of ten.
[73:24.90]seems a little high that was barely a three in my humble opinion I was being generous for the sake of his pride so identification you guys don't like this guy how could you guys not like max uh here captain hawthorne you said let me apologize in advance I'm about to ruin your day
[73:50.29]According to your ship's record, you've been flagged by the board.
[73:53.05]Your ship will be impounded until such a time as they see fit.
[73:56.00]Pounded?
[73:57.22]Well, isn't this wonderful?
[73:59.14]The captain's done something to get on the board's bad side.
[74:02.86]Now, hold on.
[74:03.58]This isn't the end of the world.
[74:05.10]Probably.
[74:07.77]Uh... I take it back.
[74:10.53]I'm not Hawthorne, and that's not my ship.
[74:13.44]Oh, thank the law.
[74:14.96]I could use a diversion.
[74:16.28]Tell me more, then.
[74:17.49]Really sell it to me.
[74:18.51]It's not mine.
[74:19.09]Uh, well, I won the ship in a poker game.
[74:23.37]Hawthorne gave me his ID so I could fly it.
[74:25.93]Hawthorne died in a crash.
[74:27.21]I took his ID so I could fly his ship.
[74:28.69]Captain Hawthorne abducted me and made me work for his ship for free.
[74:31.52]I'm a prisoner.
[74:32.26]Help!
[74:33.00]I like where this is headed.
[74:34.48]What happened to this, uh, vile kidnapper?
[74:38.48]I killed him.
[74:39.66]You must feel terrific.
[74:41.20]Good for you.
[74:47.56]So I'm stuck here?
[74:48.56]Not stuck, per se.
[74:50.48]You could always throw yourself out the airlock.
[74:52.93]Of course, then you'd find yourself with an exciting new problem.
[74:55.79]I'm on a secret mission.
[74:58.61]I take it this happens a lot.
[74:59.57]Just the opposite.
[75:00.71]The board knows we don't take kindly to their interfering in our operations here.
[75:04.95]Surely this must be some sort of mix-up.
[75:06.97]I had to take a guess as to why.
[75:09.93]You probably riled up the wrong petty board bureaucrat.
[75:12.91]A man named Udam Bedford.
[75:15.46]Okay, so kill.
[75:17.46]Kill Bedford.
[75:21.86]I'm gonna wring this Bedford guy's neck.
[75:24.70]You take the starch out of him, well, you won't hear any complaints from me.
[75:28.91]Imagine admitting to, like, the guard.
[75:30.47]Would you mind doing me a favor?
[75:32.77]What do you mean, do you a favor?
[75:34.87]Sure.
[75:35.69]Wanda Dorsett over in sickbay?
[75:37.73]Tell her the shipment's not in yet.
[75:39.17]It's not coming in anytime soon, and if she'd be so obliged to get off my ass about it.
[75:44.71]So if I do you this favor, you're not gonna talk about how I killed the guy that I just told you I was gonna go kill.
[75:48.81]Good.
[75:49.19]Got it.
[75:50.57]Uh... I'm looking for Gladys.
[75:52.46]Okay.
[76:08.63]What can he tell me about Bedford?
[76:09.85]Sounds like a fun guy.
[76:10.51]Okay.
[76:10.65]See you around.
[76:11.23]See you around.
[76:39.85]Understood.
[76:40.81]I'll keep my head down.
[76:50.32]Through the glass.
[76:51.91]Through the hole in the glass.
[76:59.99]You thought that wasn't gonna save you.
[77:02.27]Doesn't seem to care, though.
[77:03.19]Alright, let's go, uh, let's go talk to... And I'm putting my hands in the air and going TALK TO... Bedford.
[77:12.05]A quest objective requires you to enter a restricted area.
[77:14.37]If caught inside, you'll be shot on sight.
[77:16.08]Using a disguise will prevent immediate hostilities.
[77:18.02]What are you looking at?
[77:34.15]What, you think we're dressed funny?
[77:36.95]You think this is funny?
[77:41.16]Doctor and a scientist?
[77:42.14]I don't understand.
[77:44.00]What's wrong?
[77:44.60]Let's go, Max.
[77:56.15]I picked up this weird signal the other day.
[77:57.97]It was coming from Monarch.
[78:00.54]Well, like, you've never seen a doctor walk into a ship before?
[78:05.16]You've never seen a doctor and a scientist walk into a ship?
[78:07.26]What's this for?
[78:07.72]What's going on with your eyes?
[78:09.46]Oh, don't have the gun on his face!
[78:11.96]Okay.
[78:15.64]I'm not gonna kill somebody.
[78:17.54]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[78:21.52]Wait, wait, wait.
[78:22.25]Restricted area.
[78:22.95]How do I turn on the disguise?
[78:24.25]Okay.
[78:30.31]Who's talking to us?
[78:31.97]Is this restricted?
[78:32.65]Do I have to put on his disguise?
[78:42.94]How do I turn it on?
[78:52.63]This is Halcyon News.
[78:54.67]We interrupt your regular scheduled advertisement for the following story.
[78:58.18]Nobody wants you looking close at their cargo.
[79:00.72]The board would like to remind Spacers and other travelers that passage to Monarch is restricted.
[79:09.30]Me too, guys.
[79:10.57]It's like Halloween costumes coming in.
[79:12.45]Steal all your stuff.
[79:15.40]These aren't even Halloween costumes.
[79:17.13]Why do I think this is so out of the ordinary?
[79:19.29]You're dressed as a doctor and I'm dressed as a priest.
[79:21.55]Why these Halloween costumes?
[79:22.95]No, they are Halloween costumes.
[79:24.51]Because that's the number one thing that's fucking sold at the Halloween store.
[79:28.22]Is, look at me, I'm the priest.
[79:30.02]Or, look at me, I'm dressed as a doctor.
[79:32.28]I'm a doctor dickhead.
[79:36.39]So these are costumes.
[79:47.20]Rest and go keycard.
[79:49.76]Bread.
[79:51.20]Ammo.
[79:53.04]You gotta be the lookout, man.
[79:54.02]Alright.

[81:29.00]I got a full line of weapon modifications I'd be happy to show you.
[81:31.00]For free?
[81:35.00]Holy shit. Your merchant skill is equal to the value of your best dialogue skill and is used to negotiate prices when buying and selling from vendors.
[81:45.07]And I am a huge liar.
[81:47.99]I got a 12% discount.

[83:57.06]This is a good gun?
[83:58.96]Should I just keep it?
[84:00.78]Oh, it's shit.
[84:09.09]Okay.
[84:25.32]Okay, if I sell it, will it be put back on display?
[84:30.12]So if I sell this, come and it will just be on display again.
[84:33.70]Steal it, sell it, put it back on display, steal it, sell it, back on display.
[84:39.98]What else you got back here?
[84:41.58]Look at all this stuff that's just free!
[84:43.04]It's just for free.
[84:47.15]Look, these games, it doesn't matter.
[84:52.93]It is free.
[84:56.91]What?
[84:57.27]Did I get in trouble?
[84:58.47]Alright, fuck it.
[84:58.99]Let's go.
[84:59.55]Steal money out of the register first.
[85:00.83]Alright, I'm going to save it right here.
[85:05.88]How do you only have $25 in here?
[85:07.60]He's a distraction.
[85:09.96]What do you think you're doing?
[85:14.70]Nothing at all!
[85:16.24]Oh.
[85:17.66]Just be careful next time.
[85:28.90]Oh, that's so stupid.
[85:32.94]He's a liar.
[85:35.05]I have so many points in lying.
[85:36.95]You know what?
[85:37.67]Fuck it.
[85:38.43]Watch this.
[85:38.95]You want to show how good I am at lying?
[85:41.25]I didn't shoot anybody.
[85:44.72]They're not going to talk to me?
[85:58.26]Hold on, hold on.
[86:01.39]Can I like surrender?
[86:07.63]Just play dumb and lie.
[86:16.00]This time they didn't even know.
[86:26.02]Stop.
[86:26.40]You violated the law.
[86:27.66]No, I didn't.
[86:28.58]Oh, okay.
[86:30.52]You're right.
[86:30.88]You didn't.
[86:33.47]You just shot that person.
[86:34.63]I didn't shoot anybody.
[86:35.89]Oh, okay.
[86:36.51]Yeah, you didn't.
[86:37.11]It's like a Jedi mind trick.
[86:41.31]Hey.
[86:41.49]What?
[86:41.63]See?
[86:41.83]I told you they were talking shit about us.
[86:53.47]Oh, real scary.
[86:55.20]You're really going to arrest us on our station?
[86:59.36]Yeah, this is Chief Juneling's ship.
[87:01.42]You don't own shit here.
[87:02.94]Step back.
[87:05.20]I'm required by board bylaws to use excessive force.
[87:24.36]Okay, at least once.
[87:26.76]You trash.
[87:32.82]Wait, I have to steal this again.
[87:34.79]Don't give me freedom in a game.
[87:36.13]They just... Whatever I want.
[87:53.60]I wanted to steal a bunch of shit in front of this guy and keep intimidating and lying to him.
[87:57.88]Is that possible?
[88:00.50]Like, I'm gonna wait for this guy to go on his route, take something in front of him and intimidate him every time.
[88:09.52]Hey.
[88:23.54]Oh, whatever.
[88:28.55]Alright, here we go.
[88:29.13]Let's get that again.
[88:33.17]Go back to Byzantium, you gold-plated bastards.
[88:36.71]Yeah, no one wants you on Groundbreaker.
[88:38.59]These stairs are board property.
[88:41.67]Disperse now.
[88:45.21]Oh, real scary.
[88:46.73]Are you really going to arrest us on our station?
[88:49.67]We live here.
[88:51.15]Yeah, this is Chief Juneling's ship.
[88:53.21]You don't own shit here.
[88:54.89]Stupid.
[88:55.61]Step back.
[88:57.01]I'm required by board bylaws to use excessive force.
[89:00.15]Of course.
[89:00.53]You're going to attack us?
[89:04.00]You waste of O2 scrubbers.
[89:06.76]You fucking algae eaters.
[89:09.70]Just get out of here before I tell your captain what you've been getting up to on the clock.
[89:14.67]Idiot.
[89:15.47]Yeah.
[89:15.75]Let's get a drink.
[89:19.03]Yeah, hide behind that mask!
[89:26.09]Fucking so sick of that.
[89:26.99]You can smoke in here?
[89:35.26]Holy shit.
[89:35.96]Is that... Alright.
[89:36.80]I don't know how you can smoke.
[89:42.36]Wait, are you vaping?
[89:44.90]You're vaping.
[89:47.92]That's... Okay.
[90:02.03]Wait, it's talking to quicksave, right?
[90:11.53]Okay, you can't give me this... I have to fucking just move on, man.
[90:22.88]Okay, we're good.
[90:24.50]Go back to Byzantium, you gold-plated bastards.
[90:27.28]Get out of here.
[90:27.82]Go back to... No one wants you on Groundbreaker.
[90:29.96]These stairs are board property.
[90:33.00]Disperse now, or I'll detain you for trespassing.
[90:35.80]Yeah, get the fuck out of here.
[90:36.84]Those are real scary.
[90:38.36]You're really going to arrest us on our station?
[90:40.93]We have rules here.
[90:42.53]Yeah, this is Chief Junley's ship.
[90:44.57]You don't own shit here.
[90:46.31]That's right, you don't.
[90:47.19]Step back.
[90:48.39]I'm required by board bylaws to use excessive force.
[90:52.08]The Mardets would space you for trying, you waste of O2 scrubbers.
[90:58.14]Yeah, O2 scrubbers.
[91:01.15]Go back to your station.
[91:05.49]Whatever.

[91:27.90]Man.
[91:31.06]Like, do they realize... I don't... It's not like I... We have to enforce the rules.
[91:34.40]Yeah, carry on.

[95:19.90]What can I do?
[95:21.42]No.
[95:22.17]Stop playing, Koya.
[95:22.95]What's going on?
[95:23.43]I don't intend to be.
[95:24.67]It's just a matter of trust.
[95:26.79]This is where I start signaling, like, about, is there a bug under your desk?
[95:31.35]Like, I'm going to put my hands in the air and be like, talk, talk, talk, open my hands up and be like, under your desk.
[95:37.42]And then when I, I can nod and we can go somewhere else.
[95:43.22]How can I win your trust?
[95:44.88]Right on a piece of paper.
[95:53.01]Bugged.
[95:54.87]And then hold it up and be like this.
[95:57.15]Like that?
[96:01.58]Okay, information on the whereabouts of Phineas Wells would go a long way.
[96:04.34]It's my white whale, I suppose.
[96:09.05]Alright, do we sell out the guy that cryogenically unfroze us?
[96:14.61]Or... No, fuck this guy.
[96:16.11]Alright, fine.

[96:18.01]Hmm.
[96:57.31]I need this password to unlock.
[97:00.39]Put in your password.
[97:03.95]These guys are all heavily armed.
[97:05.27]There's no way I can get through here.
[97:14.30]Can I steal from him?
[97:17.24]Just beat him up for the password.
[97:19.22]That doesn't... No, I'm going to get attacked.
[97:22.60]This whole thing... If I fire a weapon in here, this whole town is going to go on lockdown.
[97:35.53]No.
[97:36.15]No, no, no.
[97:36.59]I can't.
[97:39.29]I did what I wanted to do.
[97:53.97]Sell out Phineas and you'll get the password.
[98:03.29]I'll get the password eventually.
[98:04.47]What the hell?
[98:08.98]What if I sell him out and then kill him?
[98:13.02]It's an ale that's...
[98:23.36]Good for what ails you.
[98:25.92]Oh, and it's not the best choice.
[98:28.20]It's Spacer's choice.
[98:31.07]Taste the freedom.
[98:32.23]A lot of slogans to keep track of.
[98:36.69]Sometimes I forget.
[98:37.95]How did you get that?
[98:43.65]I'm bound to satisfy headgear-related inquiries.
[98:47.73]Please send any complaints to our Consumer Care Headwear Division.
[98:51.49]It's not a complaint.
[98:52.29]It's, I would, I want, when can I get that?
[98:54.95]You would never ask if you knew what it's like in here.
[99:00.90]I mean, why anyone can be a Spacer's Choice Consumer Relations Choice Specialist.
[99:06.96]Just keep your nose clean and aim for the moon.
[99:10.60]Talk it, but is there a bug under your desk?
[99:15.25]A bug?
[99:25.68]Well, you can get them.
[99:29.02]Huh.
[99:30.64]Isn't that something?
[99:32.62]Lie plus five.
[99:34.38]I have to have this.
[99:39.58]It was made for this character.
[99:47.33]How much are they?
[99:49.50]They're not that expensive.
[100:12.12]It doesn't show it.
[100:14.48]Unbelievable.
[100:16.67]How could they?
[100:19.80]How could they?
[100:25.14]Wait, wrong person.
[100:32.83]Okay, I just got freaked out.
[100:34.89]So I have one on.

[100:50.88]See for yourself.
[100:51.72]Make a choice.
[100:54.66]Spacer's choice.
[100:58.44]Hey, we're wearing the same hat.
[101:00.34]I got you too?
[101:01.92]I mean, yeah.
[101:03.38]Same hat.
[101:04.62]How right you are.
[101:06.50]Looks really good on you.
[101:07.72]Sam can't wear it.
[101:08.76]It's a robot hat.
[101:10.81]Hope you're very happy in there.
[101:13.31]Wear it with pride.
[101:14.79]With hope.
[101:16.03]No one can take that away from you.
[101:19.05]Okay.
[101:20.01]What do you got for Sam?
[101:21.83]So I can't get it for Sam?
[101:26.44]That's unfortunate, but what about, okay, hack?
[101:28.50]Is there a lie suit?
[101:31.70]No.
[101:34.90]Ooh.
[101:36.85]Ooh.
[101:38.51]Why do you have better shit than the person that sells these exclusively?
[101:47.03]Fun times barrel.
[101:48.03]I need... Wait, what does that do?
[101:50.01]Crit damage 25%.
[101:53.66]Firing noise minus 66%.
[101:54.68]That's pretty good.
[101:59.90]Plasma.
[102:00.36]Didn't you guys say get the plasma thing?
[102:09.47]Maybe I should get plasma.
[102:13.69]I don't even have one of these already.
[102:17.98]How much are they?
[102:18.49]This thing's 895 dollars.
[102:26.09]Alright, fine.
[102:26.73]Fuck it.
[102:29.16]Alright, alright, alright.
[102:30.00]I need a workbench.
[103:16.06]Okay.
[103:18.62]Alright, this is getting real greedy here.
[103:21.94]Okay.
[103:36.84]I can't be this just totally, absolutely... No, no, no, no.
[103:44.69]I'll keep that stuff.
[103:45.29]I don't want to sell it.
[103:45.85]Alright, let's keep going.
[103:55.66]Hey!
[103:58.44]What's in the safe?
[104:08.33]Bless my heart.
[104:10.35]A stranger come knocking on a poor old woman's door.
[104:14.30]You here for a particular reason?
[104:16.00]Or did the neighbors tell you how good my sugar cookies are?
[104:19.74]What?
[104:20.87]Made without a single natural ingredient.
[104:23.59]Or an oven.
[104:24.85]Just like store-bought.
[104:27.25]Okay.
[104:28.93]Uh, what do you have for sale?
[104:31.21]Won a charming copper kettle off that girl who runs the pub.
[104:34.75]She's a fierce arm wrestler.
[104:36.64]But she's no match for your pal Gladys.
[104:43.06]Okay, this lady just speaks in riddles.
[104:45.40]Plasma rifle?
[104:47.16]Axe.
[104:50.24]Candy?
[104:52.81]Alright, fine.
[104:53.27]I'll take it.
[104:53.57]I need money.
[104:53.95]I don't have any money.
[104:55.79]Okay, too bad.
[104:57.33]Holy shit.
[104:58.33]How do I take this from you?
[105:00.43]How do I steal that?
[105:04.21]That's insane.
[105:06.37]Okay, well, let's talk about stuff.
[105:10.15]Buy candy.
[105:11.95]Alright, Phineas sent me.
[105:14.96]He said you could sell me a nav key to Stellar Bay.
[105:18.10]Well, the guy that's on the board is a wuss.
[105:19.62]I can deal with it.
[105:20.16]For the time being, at least.
[105:35.70]now I only have the one nav key and they're hard to come by these days it won't be cheap if you find yourself lacking in the bits I might have an opportunity you'd be interested in okay um it's 10 000 bits oh my god no one's ever found my bits lacking any chance of a discount
[106:03.48]And maybe I should vaporize you.
[106:05.80]And that's when we both silent for like a full 10 to 20 seconds and then finally she cracks.
[106:35.52]Okay, fine.
[106:36.10]Well, I find I'm in need of a ship captain with a little more of flexibility.
[106:41.64]Vaping.
[106:41.94]Might be this could help out the Groundbreaker, as well as earn some bits.
[106:46.48]But if you've got qualms... Not qualms.
[106:50.33]Let's talk about the details.
[106:51.39]What other jobs do you know about?
[106:52.67]What are they?
[106:52.95]You got anything else?
[106:53.43]You might want to acquaint yourself with Chun-Li Tennyson, Groundbreaker's chief.
[106:58.13]She's been trying to get a handle on this heat problem we've got.
[107:01.95]You'll find her fretting in engineering.
[107:04.61]I'd say she's a sweet girl, but law for fends someone call me a liar.
[107:09.73]Hmm.
[107:11.03]Okay.
[107:12.15]Yes, dearie?
[107:14.45]I'm ready to look into it.
[107:16.22]Ain't that just a treat?
[107:18.20]So, you know Edna, over in Engineering?
[107:21.84]On occasion, she'll pass along transmissions I might find interesting.
[107:27.00]She sent me a recording of a distress signal she'd scraped from the Groundbreaker's comm array.
[107:32.41]Curious thing is, it came from an outpost called Roseway.
[107:35.97]Roseway!
[107:36.79]And Auntie Cleo abandoned that place years ago.
[107:39.50]That's where I need to go.
[107:40.50]Uh, say no more.
[107:43.54]I'm in.
[107:43.92]You've got an ear for intrigue and a nose for bits.
[107:47.38]I like that.
[107:49.26]Here's a copy of the SOS recording, complete with the coordinates.
[107:53.58]If you should find a secret worth selling, might be I could find a buyer.
[107:58.43]Corporate bigwigs will pay top bit for inside information on their competitors.
[108:03.69]The more we got the corpse fighting each other, the less time they got to meddle in our affairs.
[108:10.63]Abandoned outpost, corporate secrets, got it.
[108:12.69]Don't forget to come find old Gladys when you're done.
[108:16.74]Thanks for your time.
[108:17.66]Anytime, sweetheart.
[108:19.54]You know where to find me.
[108:21.30]Here, take a candy with you.
[108:27.77]Nice.
[108:29.85]That just kind of scared the shit out of me for a second.
[108:36.27]Okay.
[108:37.83]So, here's the thing.
[108:42.45]I got Moonman Helmet.
[108:45.61]And, okay, so I'm at 60.
[108:49.42]Lying.
[108:50.88]I need to increase my weapons.
[108:55.38]But it's only gonna...
[109:05.96]Okay, let's at least get that.
[109:07.62]Now...
[109:26.02]How do I go over 50?
[109:27.58]I remember to explain it.
[109:28.81]Okay, let's see.
[109:30.41]Up to rank 50.
[109:31.17]After 50, you can add points directly to specialized skills.
[109:34.33]So I have to actually add it.
[109:35.79]It doesn't work like this.
[109:37.65]Okay, I see.
[109:38.43]60 lie is scrambled auto-chemicals attack at their normal speed.
[109:46.67]I gotta do some more weapons, like handguns or long guns or something.
[109:56.94]Minimum armor penetration?
[109:58.58]Yeah, something like that.
[110:02.74]Same thing with long guns.
[110:03.96]Long guns headshot does 20% more damage at 50%.
[110:06.76]Alright, let's do this because it'll do both of these.
[110:17.65]And then... Try to get this to 50%.
[110:26.21]Dodge, though?
[110:27.51]Yeah, I know, this character's horrible.
[110:29.53]Don't worry, I know.
[110:35.00]You can command your companions to use their special abilities on the enemy you are targeting.
[110:38.38]Companion 1 ability, Companion 2 ability.
[110:40.56]Okay, cool.
[110:44.34]Perk.
[110:47.12]Uh, not that one.
[110:49.52]Vendor prices?
[110:50.34]That's actually pretty good.
[110:51.24]20%!
[110:51.26]I already have 10 and 11%, so that'll be 30 plus percent.
[111:01.41]Armor rating.
[111:01.97]A few more bits.
[111:05.43]Additional ammo stock on vendors.
[111:09.57]Companion crit chance.
[111:12.69]Weapon armor durability loss.
[111:14.21]That's pretty good.
[111:19.41]That one's good too.
[111:22.15]They're all good.
[111:22.67]I think I'm going to do this one.
[111:24.81]You can just repair them.
[111:28.09]Recharge rate for the... I don't know.
[111:36.19]I think I'm just going to do the... This tactical time dilation recharge rate.
[111:44.98]Yeah, let's do it.
[111:51.48]Alright.
[111:52.92]Let's continue.
[111:54.18]I've got a lot of random things to do.
[111:57.08]So, uh... I have to go talk to Jun Lee Tennyson.
[112:05.40]Or, I could go do this.
[112:07.94]I could get Sam.
[112:12.11]If the distress signal has a nav coordinate embedded in it, play it on your ship so that Ada can get to the Roseway landing pad.
[112:21.09]Alright, we're gonna do this.
[112:23.03]We're gonna get out of here.
[112:24.19]We'll come back and do this part after.
[112:25.35]This is a bathroom.
[112:35.38]Ada.
[112:45.97]Alright, let's do modify.
[112:50.99]So I was going to... What was I going to do?
[112:53.35]I have the scope, right?
[112:58.17]This is times two.
[113:02.25]What's on it right now?
[113:03.04]Okay, this is power.
[113:06.58]This is times two.
[113:07.70]What's on it right now?
[113:08.46]Current extender side is already on it.
[113:12.06]Shit.
[113:13.34]Okay, well...
[113:16.04]I'm not going to put plasma on the sniper, don't worry.
[113:20.22]Nothing on this one yet.
[113:21.46]Alright, this is the one.
[113:24.16]I was going to put plasma on the revolver.
[113:36.03]No, wait.
[113:44.95]This is the new one that I stole.
[113:50.37]This is an assault rifle.
[113:54.63]Plasma on the assault rifle.
[113:56.71]Yep.
[114:08.46]Look at this thing.
[114:09.16]This thing's fucking nuts.
[114:13.26]And...
[114:15.77]It's got an... Extendo-site.
[114:21.23]Exacto-site?
[114:24.09]Put an Extendo-site on it, too.
[114:25.93]No, I'm gonna keep this one on.
[114:27.01]Alright, now what did I want to do with you?
[114:33.40]Nothing.
[114:34.78]You?
[114:35.04]Just get the fuck out of here.
[114:35.90]You're useless now.
[114:38.24]Actually, not really.
[114:39.00]Alright, well that's enough.
[114:41.66]Wait!
[114:44.02]Where is it?
[114:46.29]73?
[114:46.39]I don't have enough money to do this.
[114:47.93]Fuck.
[114:50.64]Dammit.
[114:51.16]Oh, wait.
[114:51.82]Break down these pistols.
[115:00.90]Don't have enough.
[115:04.93]I bought a bunch of bullshit.
[115:10.99]Mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama.
[115:18.33]Who are you?
[115:24.14]You got like a bunch of sleeping bags and stuff.
[115:25.82]Are you trying to come onto the ship here?
[115:27.52]No.
[115:41.36]Get lost.
[115:41.86]No.
[115:41.92]I've heard enough of you.
[115:42.83]Alright, Felix, tell me why I should hire you.
[115:45.03]Okay, Felix, consider this your interview.
[115:46.73]If you're trying to convince me to hire you, you're going about it all wrong.
[116:07.52]Sure, I'll help you out here.
[116:09.08]Uh, don't beg.
[116:09.66]Tell me why I need you on my crew.
[116:10.56]Not your boss?
[116:11.04]I never will be.
[116:11.48]Um...
[116:32.73]How about an interview?
[116:33.39]Okay.
[116:34.16]What's the value of pie?
[116:35.70]Mm.
[116:35.76]Mm-mm.
[117:03.40]That was an alleviate the mood interview joke.
[117:07.12]But that's kind of overdone at this point.
[117:09.30]That's so... People do that.
[117:12.42]That's so cliche now.
[117:14.20]What's your biggest flaw?
[117:15.00]It is.
[117:28.89]Well, tried my best.
[117:30.79]I appreciate you giving me another shot at least.
[117:32.75]Bye.
[117:32.99]If you change your mind, I'll be right here in the docking base.
[117:35.29]Never gonna leave.
[117:44.27]He wouldn't have looked as good as you do in that mask.
[117:59.57]Yeah, he told me he doesn't suffer idiots and everyone... If you're dumber than me, I don't like you.
[118:04.05]It's like, okay, I'm dumb.
[118:06.18]So, leave.
[118:09.88]That was his mistake.
[118:10.64]I gave him a chance.
[118:13.10]He made, like, a shitty cliche, like, this is a fun interview joke.
[118:17.96]And then I wasn't feeling it, because that's kind of cliche.
[118:20.91]And then he said he doesn't like stupid people, and I'm stupid.
[118:23.49]You want me to hire that person?
[118:25.83]Not gonna happen.
[118:26.57]Welcome back, Captain.
[118:28.45]How can I be of assistance?
[118:33.16]Uh, I picked up a distress call.
[118:34.46]Play it for me.
[118:35.46]Yes, Captain.
[118:36.44]Beginning playback now.
[118:38.34]There's... There's viscera and death everywhere.
[118:41.93]Gunfire, gnashing teeth.
[118:43.67]The unemployed!
[118:45.09]For Lord's sake, if anyone's receiving this, please send help.
[118:49.21]What?
[118:49.49]No!
[118:51.19]No, no, no!
[118:54.40]Captain, we are now capable of accessing the Roseway landing pad.
[118:59.10]Also, corporate protocol requires that all distress signals include a list of key personnel for retrieval.
[119:05.53]The embedded names are Anton Crane, Vaughn Cortez, and Orson Shaw.
[119:12.45]Okay.
[119:14.09]Goodbye.
[119:14.99]See you soon, Captain.
[119:17.11]No, no, no!
[119:20.55]Terra 2, Roseway landing pad.
[119:27.17]We're now in orbit above Roseway, Captain.
[119:31.51]Cool.
[119:32.95]Alright.
[119:33.95]Let's go.
[119:34.43]Roseway.
[119:42.11]Yeah.
[119:43.95]Scene three has got me wearing a mask now.
[119:47.66]This is the worst fucking acting gig I've ever done.
[119:52.24]But it pays alright.
[119:53.42]I'm gonna stick with it.
[120:05.62]Where's my friend?
[120:07.81]Alright, let's do, uh, not the distress signal, the doom that came to Rose.
[120:11.11]Way... Distress call, uh... Where is it?
[120:16.65]Long tomorrow?
[120:17.71]No, no, no, no, no.
[120:18.93]Where is it?
[120:20.41]The cleaning machine!
[120:21.24]There it is.
[120:24.70]This way?
[120:30.30]Wait, I deselected him?
[120:33.00]How the fuck did I do that?
[120:43.38]The unreliable narrator.
[120:44.64]Ah, I see.
[120:49.34]Underneath.
[120:49.70]There it is.
[120:57.05]Okay.
[120:59.31]What's this?
[121:01.27]Insert captain's identification cartridge to initiate remote landing.
[121:05.47]I think I already did that.
[121:07.99]Follow me.
[121:08.41]Let's take out the... Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[121:14.76]Dead Eye Assault Rifle.
[121:16.56]Let's check it out.
[121:18.26]Ooh.
[121:20.80]Yep.
[121:21.54]Nice.
[121:22.20]Ooh.
[121:22.78]Good thing I'm so glad I stole this.
[121:24.12]Is there a wall here?
[121:31.94]Of course there is.
[121:33.18]Does.
[121:33.50]Did I scream?
[121:34.56]Did I scream?
[121:43.34]Was that him?
[121:44.60]This is a silent protagonist.
[121:45.82]I don't scream.
[121:57.53]We all scream for ice cream.
[121:59.47]I did half of it.
[122:00.71]I didn't do the other half, though.
[122:01.71]Okay.
[122:13.67]See if I can get this right in the head.
[122:22.39]Wow.
[122:22.57]Well, this thing is pretty good.
[122:27.03]From that far away.
[122:32.63]Yeah, that's what... We're making pretty damn good progress.
[122:52.29]Nice.
[122:53.65]Wow, we actually can kill things now.
[122:57.84]All it took was a little bit of thievery.
[123:05.66]I'm sorry.
[123:06.80]You're smart enough to not run fast into this.
[123:11.59]Everything's fine.
[123:12.13]I'm good.
[123:13.45]Just eat an apple.
[123:16.71]Eat a can of tuna.
[123:25.03]Alright, Acid Steeper is in there.
[123:26.45]It's a workbench.
[123:35.40]Alright, this is where we have to be careful.
[123:38.20]Give me my, uh, my revolver.
[123:39.84]Yeah.
[123:40.30]Yep.
[123:41.04]Yes.
[123:45.48]Did the tuna sound?
[123:46.53]What does the tuna sound?
[123:47.47]What does that mean?
[124:03.21]Oh shit!
[124:05.21]Do your super move.
[124:06.95]Over there!
[124:10.87]What?
[124:11.25]He has a knife now?
[124:19.98]What is going on?
[124:21.52]Oh, he's dead.
[124:29.46]So it does a cutscene.
[124:33.10]Oh, okay, that's weird.
[124:44.91]Can I heal you?
[124:46.29]I could spend hours reflecting on the secret workings of the universe.
[124:50.89]Little else in this colony offers such a relaxing pastime.
[124:55.18]So, tell me what's on your mind.
[124:57.54]I excel at confessional listening.
[125:07.57]Okay.
[125:14.07]Slow it down.
[125:16.61]Oh, no.
[125:17.17]Wait.
[125:17.31]No.
[125:17.47]No.
[125:45.64]God damn it.
[125:52.64]Where's the anti- where's the... ...antibiotics lab?
[125:55.91]Is it auntie or auntie?
[125:57.75]I thought it was auntie.
[125:58.69]Where- where is that?
[126:02.53]I don't have any lockpicking skill.
[126:12.49]Shit!
[126:13.25]Why can't you be a lockpicker?! !
[126:26.60]There's no other way to get in there.
[126:27.56]I have to go find that person.
[126:34.12]Oh, that don't work.
[126:51.50]Ow.
[127:08.49]Oh my god, is this a boss?
[127:24.40]That thing was insane.
[127:25.46]Okay, what were you... What were you guarding?
[127:34.69]No, nothing.
[127:38.77]Who's calling me?
[127:40.91]Oh, no.
[127:41.39]There's a bunch of them.
[127:42.39]I have to... We have to leave.
[127:43.49]This is not going to work out.
[127:47.75]Holy shit.
[127:58.59]There's somebody right at the front door.
[128:03.03]Super move.
[128:05.57]Never anger a man of the cloth.
[128:09.48]Oh, wow.
[128:10.16]That was awesome.
[128:11.02]Nice work.
[128:16.14]Oh, still alive.
[128:17.44]Alright, that was pretty cool.
[128:22.61]I gotta say.
[128:29.07]Alright.
[128:30.83]There's a chest over here.
[128:32.19]Ooh.
[128:37.85]Wait a minute.
[128:41.24]Come on, you have to... Passcode!
[128:45.58]Thank God.
[128:50.45]Password I think was 1234, by the way.
[128:54.47]Pick it up.
[129:03.80]What's that?
[129:04.80]Toothpaste?
[129:07.58]Okay.
[129:09.04]We did it.
[129:13.35]That was hard.
[129:15.69]Okay, let me go over something very quickly with you guys.
[129:18.83]So, before the stream started, somebody, I don't know who, you might even still be here.
[129:25.61]Somebody said, dude, you should do the whole stream in a Boston accent.
[129:32.14]And I keep thinking back to that person.
[129:36.06]And I'm doing it.
[129:38.36]Because I'm thinking about them saying it.
[129:46.36]Alright, here we go.
[129:54.28]Like, you're in my head.
[129:57.53]Alright, what is this?
[129:59.37]Armory Logs.
[130:02.07]Force.
[130:03.39]Flog.
[130:04.03]The Flogistinator.
[130:05.75]Pistol.
[130:09.39]What?
[130:11.86]Force Flogistocotron pistol status functional.
[130:15.26]Untrained personnel must attend site safety seminar before using.
[130:18.44]As a seminar officer is not currently available, recommend permanent secure storage.
[130:24.66]Ammunition entries not found.
[130:28.60]Where do I get that?
[130:29.58]Where do I get the Flogistinator?
[130:37.01]Plasma Carbine?
[130:37.91]What's that do?
[130:44.21]Acid steeper.
[130:46.07]There it is.
[130:55.94]Energy cells.
[130:56.84]I think that's all there is to do in here.
[131:00.46]I can keep going down.
[131:01.82]Is anything else in here?
[131:05.10]There's something else in Ro's way.
[131:12.08]No.
[131:12.58]Distress signal.
[131:15.24]The schematics for Orson's prototype would likely be valuable to Gladys.
[131:21.70]Distress call.
[131:22.82]From the broadcast tower.
[131:25.16]And... Company secrets.
[131:28.98]Schematics.
[131:29.92]Yeah, there it is.
[131:31.47]So there is something down here.
[131:35.39]Maintenance logs.
[131:37.13]Is this too much info?
[131:40.39]No, it's not.
[131:40.81]There's one sentence.
[131:42.35]We don't have a replacement.
[131:43.69]Someone tried to disable the mandatory consumer broadcast on 17.
[131:46.24]The thing got stuck in maximum volume mode until we factory reset it.
[131:50.12]12, it's serious malfunction today.
[131:52.72]We shut it down for now.
[131:54.28]No response on the behavior modules.
[131:55.56]For the time being, we'll have to just hype in the chat.
[131:59.04]Whatever it says.
[131:59.60]Sometimes violence is the only way.
[132:22.35]Where's your, uh, belly?
[132:25.39]Why don't you not have a belly?
[132:28.51]You keep saying everyone.
[132:32.40]It's just me.
[132:33.82]Mono lens?
[132:38.00]Ooh.
[132:39.06]Boy.
[132:42.24]Bit cartridges.
[132:45.94]Okay, let's get the schematic.
[132:48.60]Detailed drawings of an advanced pistol.
[132:51.02]Revisions and comments are scrawled across the image in mostly illegible writing, except for the name Orson Shaw scribbled in the corner.
[133:00.85]The schematics depict a... ...flog pistol from a brand named Force, which is not native to the Halcyon colony.
[133:09.29]It is unclear from these plans what a flog does.
[133:15.06]Okay, I got plans.
[133:23.48]Energy cell.
[133:25.02]What's up here?
[133:28.75]Okay.
[133:30.99]Investigate rows to find potential company secrets that could be sold to the highest bidder.
[133:35.29]So I have one of the company secrets.
[133:38.63]But there's also this distress call.
[133:43.31]And I want to see what's going on over here.
[133:45.51]So we're going to go that way.
[133:49.48]We're not just going to skip everything.
[133:50.80]I want to see what's going on.
[133:56.66]This is a lot of shit.
[133:57.98]You know that.
[134:05.31]Okay.
[134:13.92]You didn't check literally half the room?
[134:15.70]I don't have time for that.
[134:21.67]What are you doing out here, guys?
[134:25.49]What the fuck?
[134:32.59]Kill him!
[134:34.57]Where's my guy?
[134:36.44]Where's my guy?
[134:38.54]Ow!
[134:56.28]What?!
[135:10.97]Okay, that was just GUR from Invader Zim.
[135:15.54]Sorry, I didn't mean to kill you, Gur.
[135:22.90]That was an ambush.
[135:23.94]Annoying.
[135:34.42]Distress call.
[135:35.00]We can't leave.
[135:35.58]Not yet.
[135:43.96]Is that the dumb robot dog?
[135:45.82]Yes.
[135:47.08]Except it's not a dog.
[135:48.18]It's a robot that's in a dog costume because then he can blend in as the dog and... And that's... Like, you know, you've seen the show.
[136:02.71]And then sometimes... Sometimes he goes... And everyone laughs.
[136:09.87]Everyone thinks it's fun.
[136:18.92]That's right, don't mess with us!
[136:19.98]And then sometimes, he'll go... I want pancakes!
[136:31.25]And then runs out of the room.
[136:33.33]It's not a bad show.
[136:43.75]Should've put up a sign.
[136:45.10]Don't open, Raptagon's inside.
[136:47.70]Raptodons?
[136:48.34]What is a raptodon?
[136:49.12]Is that lemonade?
[136:58.77]Boss fight incoming.
[137:01.13]It's a raptodon boss fight.
[137:02.47]I got that info from my... You good?
[137:10.53]Ride it.
[137:10.89]I don't think we can do anything about this.
[137:12.81]I think you just have to stay there.
[137:14.81]Should I shoot it?
[137:16.07]What happened?
[137:42.67]That summoned God?
[137:43.79]That was weird.
[137:47.04]Well, how do I... I can't get out of the river.
[137:57.20]I can't blow... I can't explode anything?
[138:00.04]Wait, there are people over here?
[138:01.96]No, it's monsters.
[138:10.99]Huh?
[138:11.43]Oh shit, you're not- you did- Alright, well I'm done with you.
[138:20.67]Because you don't- you're not doing anything.
[138:46.87]Check everything.
[138:49.08]People get really mad at me if I don't check everything.
[138:51.48]They go, he didn't check the boxes over there.
[138:53.74]There was stuff in them.
[138:56.14]He didn't check the scientist's bodies.
[138:58.96]He didn't open the chest that was over here.
[139:00.92]I know.
[139:02.60]I understand.
[139:13.62]Burke.
[139:15.75]Corporate recruit, wait.
[139:18.03]So we're good?
[139:25.46]Are they bad or are they good?
[139:27.22]Bad or good?
[139:29.04]They're probably good?
[139:30.32]Hello?
[139:36.04]I done had enough of this shit.
[139:38.24]I'm just the fucking tarmac guard.
[139:40.53]No one said nothing about fighting no raps.
[139:45.19]Uh, did you send a distress call?
[139:46.61]What?
[139:48.21]Wait, what?
[139:49.15]Uh, who's in charge?
[139:50.95]It actually looks pretty calm out here.
[140:13.86]You said the wraps broke loose.
[140:15.86]Did you have them in a cage?
[140:17.20]Okay.
[140:17.42]I see anti-Cleos.
[140:18.08]Anti.
[140:18.28]Anti.
[140:18.40]I had it right.
[140:45.84]Actually, I think I need to do something here, don't I?
[140:52.70]Solution... Distress signal.
[140:55.98]No, no, no.
[140:56.38]Long tomorrow?
[140:59.30]No.
[141:05.20]I thought I could get... Oh, it's a doctor.
[141:09.02]I like you.
[141:10.40]If you've come to end my life, let's be on with it.
[141:14.01]Oh, not actually one of them, are you?
[141:17.85]No, did you send the distress call?
[141:19.55]You kind of look like the guy that sent the distress call.
[141:22.53]Right the first time.
[141:23.60]I'm here to end your life.
[141:28.84]If I knew who he was, he'd already be dead.
[141:33.10]What?
[141:34.10]I'm Anton Crane, the lead scientist here.
[141:38.65]I must apologize if my call diverted you.
[141:40.85]I may have panicked.
[141:43.76]Everything's under control now, though, truth be told.
[141:49.90]Who did you think I was?
[141:51.40]Why, one of our attackers, of course.
[141:54.23]Obviously, they were drawn here in an attempt to make off with my research.
[142:00.57]Why cancel the distress call my research may not quite fall within legal parameters illegal I'm under orders to maintain wireless silence.
[142:08.45]However, having your head used as target practice can addle one's thinking I Cut the call immediately once I've gathered my way.
[142:16.33]So it was a home office can't know what's happening here.
[142:18.94]Oh Yeah, tell me what you're actually doing here or I will let them know myself I
[142:26.36]And take great joy in doing so, I might add.
[142:28.78]Thank you, Dr. Max.
[142:30.66]I appreciate that.
[142:31.76]If I don't get that research back, my life is over regardless.
[142:35.68]We were tasked with formulating a new and improved dental gel.
[142:41.75]Dental gel.
[142:42.51]Yes, I see.
[142:43.35]Very important.
[142:44.53]What's dental gel?
[142:46.37]Toothpaste.
[142:48.23]One cannot exaggerate the benefits of good dental hygiene.
[142:51.55]May I continue?
[142:56.24]Please do.
[142:57.10]While doing research on enzymes specific to the Raptodon's digestive system, we developed an additive which we subsequently discovered to be the most effective appetite suppressant ever.
[143:09.53]Uh, you can couch it however you like.
[143:12.06]It's still just toothpaste.
[143:13.92]Uh, diet toothpaste.
[143:15.86]Not just any diet toothpaste.
[143:18.52]The ultimate diet toothpaste.
[143:23.45]That's like discovering the best rocket fuel ever.
[143:27.71]I'm just the ogre from Warcraft.
[143:28.95]Toothpaste?
[143:29.29]Oh, how absolutely adequate.
[143:30.73]Toothpaste, good!
[143:31.19]I'm speaking twice with two different heads.
[143:55.75]uh auntie cleo's appazap diet toothpaste in itself nice is it not came up with that myself oh yeah an ogre mage almost as befuddled as my co-workers here what do you want from me hours ago a group of vicious malcontents fell upon us shot up our labs and loosed our research subjects the raptadons if those cretans get their hands on my research well they'll need not kill me
[144:25.84]Remove the cretins retrieved this research check you want should I handle your rapid on problem?
[144:31.71]Yes, but don't kill their mother if it's avoidable.
[144:34.71]We've need of her to replenish our stocks I think there's gas in the lab somewhere that can be used to put them out The research is in the safe in my office.
[144:45.24]You'll have need of my code and key card The labs entrance is in the side of a hill.
[144:50.68]You can't miss it.
[144:51.40]If you just follow the road You'll pass by the town's original
[144:57.41]Jameson.
[144:58.35]He's in the old lab.
[145:02.05]Who's Jameson?
[145:03.05]My protege.
[145:04.27]I sent him to retrieve some metabolic precursors, and I forgot him.
[145:08.95]How do you forget... What?
[145:10.35]You forgot him?
[145:13.72]You left him to die.
[145:14.76]You should be ashamed of yourself.
[145:15.82]Don't you think it weighs on me?
[145:17.64]He was my responsibility.
[145:20.16]All of them were.
[145:21.22]Ah, regardless of their thinking on the matter.
[145:23.94]Yeah, you send me to do this.
[145:25.14]If he has died...

[155:56.57]This is not a Fallout game.
[155:57.83]Alright, alright.
[155:58.58]Okay, yeah, okay.
[156:00.04]This is not a Fallout game.
[156:02.74]It's not.
[156:04.58]This is not a Fallout game.
[156:09.04]Not even close.
[156:11.42]It's not even close.
[156:13.00]You're right.
[156:17.50]I correct my statement about this is not even close.
[156:22.37]Hey!
[156:26.91]Help!
[156:34.79]Do something!
[156:35.45]Do something!
[156:36.75]What happened to the dentist?
[156:38.33]Did he get crushed?
[156:39.87]I just quick-saved it right here like a fucking idiot.
[156:50.12]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[157:02.31]Okay, we're good.
[157:10.72]Dust accumulation analysis.
[157:14.02]2.5 years.
[157:17.26]Go back to the ship, Sam.
[157:25.23]But there was a crashed ship over here.
[157:27.01]So, I want to see what the hell it is.
[157:32.11]Can I do anything with this ship?
[157:33.35]Can I go inside the ship?
[157:34.46]Can I look inside the ship?
[157:35.56]I cannot.
[157:36.08]Let's go.
[157:42.56]Alright, slow down.
[157:45.38]Can I not walk over this?
[157:47.80]Scout the area.
[157:49.48]Yep.
[157:53.09]One that way, one over there.
[157:55.67]Monsters and shit over that way.
[157:57.53]Let's go over here.
[158:03.30]How does Sam sneak?
[158:05.44]I guess you just don't.
[158:28.87]Get him.
[158:30.98]Toothpaste him.
[158:32.70]Nice.
[158:36.80]Oops.
[158:40.56]Special move?
[158:41.32]Let's see what's...
[158:49.01]Good work.
[158:51.29]Traffic levels.
[158:51.81]Alright, let's go save Jameson.
[158:53.99]Come to me.
[158:55.85]Okay, there's a lot of shit in here that I have to do, remind me.
[159:19.62]Let's take out the revolver for this part.
[159:23.16]I don't need any of this stuff.
[159:26.08]How many heals do I have?
[159:27.12]Eight?
[159:27.86]That's kind of low.
[159:29.87]But not too low.
[159:30.87]I don't even know what I'm picking up.
[159:43.00]Plasma rifle?
[159:45.34]I'm going to become over and... Oh, hack!
[159:50.29]Okay.
[159:50.83]All personnel, please report to assigned workstations.
[159:53.99]Tired of itchy acid burns?
[159:55.45]Try Auntie Cleo's artisanal borst-scented moisturizing cream.
[160:00.19]Lock.
[160:02.24]Hallway door unlocked.
[160:03.52]As is protocol, unauthorized entry will be marked in Site Supervisor Crane A's records.
[160:09.02]Got messages here.
[160:11.36]I guess... There you go.
[160:12.66]Screenshot.
[160:13.80]Screenshot.
[160:15.30]Screenshot.
[160:16.96]So you can read them on your own time.
[160:23.93]okay let's move actually important question what am I doing for Thanksgiving streaming let him fight let him fight let him fight let him fight let him fight I smite you in the name of the law
[160:53.62]Whoa!
[160:56.58]Uh, because, uh, already, we already did Thanksgiving.
[161:03.51]We did it a little early because I have some dietary restrictions now because I have an endoscopy coming up in a few days.
[161:14.75]So, I couldn't really eat Thanksgiving on Thanksgiving, if that makes any sense.
[161:26.34]Because, yeah, I picked a bad time, I guess, to have an appointment.
[161:30.08]But yeah, that's kind of how it played out.
[161:34.27]But, yeah.
[161:36.65]I have a couple of dietary restrictions.
[161:39.37]Starting now, so.
[161:45.03]Yeah, it was good.
[161:46.28]That was part of the reason why the stream was only like four and a half hours last night.
[161:51.08]Because we did all that stuff.
[161:54.10]Experimental notes!
[161:57.22]Screenshot it.
[161:59.20]Screenshot it.
[162:00.20]Wait, no, no, no, this is important.
[162:06.27]No, that's not important.
[162:10.17]That's not important either.
[162:11.15]Minor stomach pain and nausea, safe.
[162:14.45]Major stomach pain, debilitating nausea, vomiting, unsafe.
[162:20.11]Alright, so don't drink this.
[162:28.43]Alright, Jameson is over here.
[162:31.95]Wait, where's the mother?
[162:34.81]Don't I have to save the mother?
[162:36.81]Don't kill the mother, right?
[162:37.87]Uh, how do I tell who's a mom?
[162:42.04]Time to take him down!
[162:45.42]Ah!
[162:46.24]Get him!
[162:53.18]Get him!
[162:58.07]Great acting.
[163:03.42]Cannot use while in combat.
[163:04.76]Am I still in combat?
[163:06.88]What's still fighting us?
[163:10.14]Messages from Crane.
[163:13.78]Please feel free to enjoy one 10 minute break between your normally scheduled 3 o'clock and 4 o'clock patrol shifts.
[163:22.95]This guy's a dick.
[163:27.77]Seriously.
[163:29.49]I'm working for this person?
[163:36.12]Oooh, can't get it.
[163:38.20]Any more of those little things?
[163:42.98]I'm gonna run out of room here.
[163:44.68]Oh, there's one right there.
[163:48.17]Shit.
[163:48.39]Should I do it?
[163:48.85]I'm doing it.
[163:53.91]Shock cannon.
[163:57.89]Am I not over-encumbered?
[163:59.77]I'm going to be getting close here soon.
[164:03.59]Okay, let's go.
[164:05.87]Pick the lock.
[164:13.36]Hey!
[164:14.00]Me!
[164:14.24]What do you got in here?
[164:17.42]What else do you got in here?
[164:21.86]Anything else?
[164:22.26]What are you storing in here?
[164:23.44]I'll take it.
[164:26.47]Okay, what's that?

[164:47.14]Uh, truth be told, the Raptadons did most of the work on the door.
[164:50.24]I'm not sure they know what a lock is.
[164:52.07]Uh, Anton sent me to get you.
[164:55.61]Can't use the centrifuge without supervision.
[164:58.17]Can't file reports without him double-checking their every word.
[165:01.40]Can't save myself from mortal peril.
[165:04.16]It's like he thinks I'm a child.
[165:06.16]His hands-on management style is coming to a point of contention, I tell you.
[165:11.57]You're upset that he sent me to rescue you?
[165:13.41]Take it up with him if you'd like, and I'll go before more raps find this place.
[165:16.85]Yeah, like, take it up with him.
[165:20.59]I have nothing to do with this.
[165:28.61]Wait, there's other stuff here.
[165:36.33]Well, it wasn't even real.
[165:37.59]Alright, there's other shit to do here.
[165:38.61]Uh... Jameson is pissed off by the otherwise fine.
[165:42.89]Head back to Roseway to give Anton the news.
[165:45.83]Find Anton safe.
[165:48.66]Eliminate the outlaws.
[165:49.76]Deal with the raptodons.
[165:52.08]Okay.
[165:53.62]Return to Gladys.
[165:54.82]No.
[165:57.66]Okay, this one.
[166:00.06]No, it's this one.
[166:02.56]So...
[166:05.06]Eliminate the Outlaws and the Raptodons.
[166:08.46]So it's down in the lab, I guess, maybe?
[166:11.10]Somewhere?
[166:14.22]We're gonna go take a look.
[166:18.02]Is there a way for me to go down?
[166:20.50]There is.
[166:23.03]Okay.
[166:24.33]Do you think... You went to prison?
[166:25.61]What?
[166:34.19]is it alive?
[166:42.25]watch out!
[166:46.22]he can do this very often
[167:05.75]Any more?
[167:06.05]I think that's it.
[167:10.09]No, you're going the wrong way.
[167:12.69]Okay, so... Let's get this.
[167:14.23]Let's get this.
[167:18.94]Get this.
[167:21.32]Oh, a hack.
[167:22.12]I can hack this.
[167:26.90]Anti-riot gear.
[167:28.90]I'll take it.
[167:31.19]Alright, now, over here I have to deal with the raptodons.
[167:35.86]Don't kill the mother.
[167:36.72]I'm gonna fuck this up, the mother's probably gonna die.
[167:44.83]Right over here?
[167:46.21]Wait.
[167:49.39]Is it just up there?
[167:50.25]Hold on.
[167:55.90]It's just in that room?
[168:03.47]I guess it's just in here.
[168:04.55]Oh, this is the wrong lab.
[168:10.63]Wrong place.
[168:12.54]Oh, okay.
[168:13.68]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[168:15.88]Well, alright.
[168:18.54]Can I fast travel anywhere?
[168:24.71]Wait a minute.
[168:27.35]Find ant and safe.
[168:32.49]So we gotta go back this way.
[168:36.01]Wrong planet.
[168:37.63]You're on the wrong planet.
[168:41.18]That would be stupid.
[168:48.08]Alright, truth be told, this weapon's the only weapon I have that's worth using.
[168:55.17]The revolver isn't doing much damage.
[168:57.47]Don't!
[168:58.11]I'm dead.
[168:58.39]Okay, I'm not dead.
[169:09.73]I can't believe you guys made it.
[169:11.99]Slow.
[169:22.63]I just like watching them do it.
[169:26.38]Okay.
[169:27.78]Here we go.
[169:31.04]There's a scrap mechanic thing over here.
[169:35.22]Deal with the outlaws.
[169:36.64]Right.
[169:36.86]I think I have to kill everything.
[169:39.18]We'll find out.
[169:40.28]I always wanted to sneak into a secret lab by crawling through the vents like they do in the serials.
[169:45.58]I guess not.
[169:45.96]Let's go.
[169:46.54]Covert lab.
[169:50.31]That's my signature for falling off a cliff is saying, Don't!
[169:54.41]Lemony fresh aerosol canister requires replacement.
[170:00.43]Yeah.
[170:04.31]I can sell all these shotguns.
[170:05.84]Save it.
[170:10.15]Okay, I need to do gas on the mother.
[170:16.16]Do I have any, do I have gas?
[170:24.60]That's a huge splash damage too.
[170:33.98]We good?
[170:35.18]Wait.
[170:40.37]Okay.
[170:41.53]I thought it said mother.
[170:42.29]I was like, well, that's great.
[170:43.27]Alright.
[170:50.13]Got tail.
[170:50.87]I did.
[170:51.15]Looks like we have to go down, but let me just... Let me look around.
[170:58.72]You know, it's not all about going as fast as possible.
[171:01.28]Sometimes you just need to take a minute and pick up everything.
[171:06.41]And either sell it immediately and not even... I'm probably not even going to look at it in my inventory once.
[171:12.06]But it's money.
[171:18.85]Looks good.
[171:20.97]So eliminate the outlaws and then the raptadons.
[171:23.87]And then the data is over there.
[171:25.35]So let's just go... Let's do the raptadons first.
[171:42.91]Alright, well, I guess we're doing this first.
[171:52.41]That guy's got a heavy machine gun.
[171:58.71]Burn him with the toothpaste, nice work.
[172:03.92]What you got?
[172:04.46]Can I take that thing?
[172:06.18]Jeweled ring?
[172:07.52]I think he had a heavy weapons gun.
[172:15.23]More weapon parts.
[172:16.05]Good.
[172:17.73]Alright.
[172:18.45]Uh, outlawed, uh, Rapidons.
[172:21.61]This way.
[172:24.91]Messages.
[172:27.63]Good news and bad news.
[172:28.61]The bad news is that we've got a sprat problem.
[172:30.65]The good news is that my Hephaestus hammers clobbered your precious Rizos rangers.
[172:35.93]Would you care for some Auntie Cleo's tripped kale pasta sauce with your humble pie?
[172:39.59]Okay.
[172:41.67]You'll need to sedate them manually.
[172:43.43]Bring a few canisters of sedative and hook it up to the auxiliary terminal in the main research chamber.
[172:51.35]Bring a few canisters of sedative and hook it up to the auxiliary terminal in the main research chamber.
[172:59.46]uh wrapped on okay I have here a form proving the relocation of our wrapped on mother to the main hall a form signed by you first of all the structural integrity of our raptadon tanks are not nearly sufficient to contain an enraged raptadon mother secondly rapidons are notoriously territorial and extremely protective of the young please stop me if I'm using too many numbers for you seeing how you don't seem to realize that raptadon mother plus raptadon tank equals murder
[173:28.58]Alright.
[173:28.74]What is this?
[173:30.28]Sedative canister.
[173:33.04]It's guaranteed to render even the largest Raptodon unconscious for no less than six hours and has a refreshing antiseptic scent.
[173:40.77]Alright.
[173:42.39]Okay.
[173:45.61]There she is.
[173:48.47]So, where do I put the canister in to knock them all out?
[173:58.67]Well, I guess we'll find it.
[173:59.61]Eliminate the outlaws.
[174:04.23]Wait.
[174:06.35]Just shoot it?
[174:06.95]There's the mother.
[174:27.83]Alright, turn it on.
[174:30.41]You need three sedative canisters.
[174:35.93]Run!
[174:37.27]Run!
[174:40.99]Run!
[174:41.63]What's quick load?
[174:42.29]Okay.
[174:54.84]So I need three canisters.
[174:58.44]I get more money if I do it this way.
[175:00.67]I walked by one and I remember looking at it and going, that looks a little odd.
[175:04.41]What's that thing?
[175:11.47]Damn it.
[175:14.79]Can I... I'm not sure I can.
[175:20.87]They're inside.
[175:21.75]There's another one.
[175:23.85]Okay, so that's one, two.
[175:25.09]I need one more.
[175:29.05]If you see one, let me know.
[175:34.66]There are two more inside.
[175:35.98]Wait, inside the actual chamber?
[175:42.30]Should I just run?
[175:42.94]Can I... You guys wait here.
[175:45.38]Can I tell them to wait?
[175:48.44]I just ran past two of them.
[175:49.50]What?
[175:52.48]No, I didn't.
[175:52.84]What are you talking about?
[175:53.94]Where?
[175:54.14]Where?
[176:02.44]So I have two.
[176:03.92]One, two, three... Do they actually have one?
[176:12.53]Up in here?
[176:13.01]Let me see.
[176:19.25]No.
[176:20.79]Nope.
[176:22.09]Nope!
[176:27.83]Alright, easy.
[176:31.00]Hey!
[176:31.32]You!
[176:32.82]Over here!
[176:34.11]Oh, good.
[176:34.99]You're not shooting at me.
[176:36.59]That's a stop.
[176:38.47]It's been a bit of a day, so I'll get to the point.
[176:41.37]Yes, I have Crane's research.
[176:43.45]No, I'm not giving it back.
[176:45.35]Sorry to disappoint you.
[176:46.41]What are you talking about?
[176:49.29]Who the fuck is Crane?
[176:50.95]I suppose it does not matter.
[176:54.19]Either Crane sent you, or you are some scavenger come to rob me in my moment of weakness.
[177:00.07]Let's make a deal.
[177:01.49]I'd like to go on living.
[177:02.95]You'd probably like to make some money.
[177:05.11]Help me get out of here and I will pay you for your trouble.
[177:10.31]Okay.
[177:13.11]Or I could just shoot you and skip all the hassle.
[177:17.99]Make me a deal.
[177:19.03]Your life is in my hands right now.
[177:22.34]Trust me.
[177:23.28]I'll make it worth your while.
[177:25.06]But that's... You need to...
[177:30.25]My WoW is worth a lot.
[177:31.05]Huh.
[177:31.13]Well, why are you down here?
[177:31.89]I like how that was a lie, even though you as your character are too dumb to even remember who Crane was.
[178:01.23]Yeah, it could be either way.
[178:02.47]But if you're dumb and you don't remember, is not remembering a lie?
[178:08.48]We've had that conversation on this stream before.
[178:11.86]If I said something and I don't remember it, did I lie about it or was it just too stupid to not remember it?
[178:20.10]I'm not a bandit like you.
[178:22.35]Oh, please.
[178:23.65]I'm not shaking down valuables from hapless travelers.
[178:27.17]I'm stealing corporate secrets.
[178:33.21]This is an underground lab.
[178:35.31]Off the radar.
[178:36.69]That means their research is secret.
[178:38.84]And secrets are always valuable.
[178:41.55]Granted, diet toothpaste is not exactly what comes to mind when I imagine secret research... Too stupid to not remember it, so you remembered it.
[178:48.68]No, no, other way.
[178:50.40]Do you like diet toothpaste?
[178:51.68]Diet toothpaste?
[178:53.32]Can you imagine a more pernicious example of corporate materialism?
[178:57.75]I do not know what is worse, working here or dying here.
[179:03.72]I've been watching the VOD and your tarot rant made me really sad.
[179:06.78]Can't believe people don't fucking read on the toilet.
[179:08.64]Thank you.
[179:09.60]Welcome.
[179:10.16]Welcome back to the stream.
[179:11.30]Thank you.
[179:11.66]Alright, you went through all this trouble to steal a formula for diet toothpaste.
[179:17.07]I already know the secret formula for diet toothpaste.
[179:20.19]I was led to believe this was a high-priority corporate facility hiding valuable research.
[179:25.89]This job was not supposed to end with me stuck in some wretched lab smelling like rats.
[179:31.78]So I would be very much obliged if you gave me a break.
[179:38.01]What do you need?
[179:38.63]The first thing I need is a keycard to unlock my door.
[179:42.22]Then I'd need you to clear me a path out of here.
[179:45.15]Kill her and take the recipe for diet toothpaste yourself.
[179:47.97]You will be the best dumb space dentist.
[180:17.90]Uhhh... Anna was worried you might have made off with this research.
[180:22.36]He even called you Cretans.
[180:25.04]Alright, I'm gonna need a good reason for the risk of my neck.
[180:26.88]Okay.
[180:26.98]Um...
[180:42.02]We're going in a circle.
[180:44.00]Why should I do this for you?
[180:45.04]Halves?
[180:47.45]Not good enough.
[180:52.25]Why should I do this for me?
[180:53.53]Because of this.
[180:54.05]Well, what do I need to do?
[180:55.19]You need to do this.
[180:55.97]Well, why should I help you?
[180:57.43]Because I'm going to give you this money.
[180:58.62]Well, that's not good enough.
[181:00.12]Why do I need to do this?
[181:01.08]Well, because of this.
[181:02.16]Well, why should I do that?
[181:03.34]I'm going around in a circle.
[181:05.84]Alright, let's go.
[181:06.38]Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, what?
[181:11.23]I'm in your debt recover the data that's I can't recover I'm this is the data uh don't flatter yourself on my honor you will be well rewarded okay sit tight take your time I am to my chagrin not going anywhere
[181:39.71]No, you aren't.
[181:40.97]Alright, so now I have to get you out of here.
[181:44.24]So we have to clear the... Okay, Raptodon's clear.
[181:48.34]I need one more of those... One more of those things.
[181:51.74]One more canister.
[181:52.42]I'm gonna do the Raptodon way.
[181:54.41]Is this person friendly?
[182:01.97]I can... I said I could talk to them.
[182:07.44]Move along.
[182:09.18]Okay.
[182:10.60]I'm supposed to get rid of the outlaws.
[182:16.15]Why are they not attacking me now?
[182:17.27]Because I talked to her?
[182:18.03]Carry on.
[182:31.36]I treated New Vegas like a joke, treating Outer Worlds like a super serious role-playing game.
[182:36.28]Well, I have one rebuttal to you, and that is, there's no console command to spawn EZ Peets.
[182:44.41]So, what do you want me to tell you?
[182:48.27]There is.
[182:48.85]Why did you just tell me that?
[182:51.62]I played New Vegas fairly normally until I spawned a Deathclaw, and then the whole game was ruined.
[182:59.64]Like, after 12 hours in the game.
[183:10.46]Squad leader?
[183:11.06]I can't talk to the squad leader?
[183:26.29]I could kill two birds with one stone here.
[183:28.11]Eliminate the outlaws.
[183:30.73]alright what what seriously what do I what do I care let's go ready guys I've had quite enough of you wait I didn't it wasn't my command he just did that on his own
[184:02.07]I've had quite enough!
[184:04.41]No!
[184:04.69]No!
[184:04.89]Max!
[184:05.21]Max!
[184:05.45]Settle down!
[184:08.99]Oh shit!
[184:10.29]Okay, do it!
[184:10.81]Do it!
[184:11.03]Do it!
[184:13.38]This person's gonna get destroyed.
[184:18.96]That person's still playing the arcade machine.
[184:30.62]Okay.
[184:31.36]Why are they running this way?
[184:32.22]Holy shit.
[184:38.49]The knees?
[184:45.25]Go!
[184:46.76]Go!
[184:47.20]Get him!
[184:50.08]That's just an upgraded version of you.
[184:51.56]You can do it.
[184:52.08]Oh no.
[184:54.04]No you can't.
[184:59.83]That's an 862 damage!
[185:11.79]On the reload, again.
[185:12.97]Jeremy, what the fuck.
[185:24.47]Oh shit, okay.
[185:30.19]Okay.
[185:31.75]Bandits currently being eliminated.
[185:34.55]I don't work with bandits.
[185:35.75]I'm sorry.
[185:36.19]I just don't.
[185:37.85]No.
[185:56.18]You're literally working with one right now.
[185:59.58]You don't know that.
[186:05.97]You don't think... I'm not going to double cross this person?
[186:25.11]This person's not my best friend.
[186:27.22]Print security keycard.
[186:29.90]Keycard deployed.
[186:30.60]Thank you for using Argos.
[186:33.00]I have an escape route.
[186:35.12]Release Cassandra.
[186:38.93]Not yet.
[186:44.95]Open this, too.
[186:50.78]Grenade launcher.
[186:52.10]Oh boy.
[186:53.26]That's a good one.
[186:54.77]That's considered a long weapon, isn't it?
[186:57.79]I hope so.
[187:01.73]Look at all the stuff that's in here.
[187:06.83]It's actually easier just to tap than hold.
[187:10.60]Excuse me.
[187:12.14]Alright, I want to do the... Oh, I'm over-encumbered.
[187:14.82]I knew it was going to happen eventually.
[187:16.12]Alright, we can break down some stuff.
[187:17.22]Let's go to... What do I have that I want to break down?
[187:21.85]These security blades.
[187:22.75]Who cares?
[187:23.13]I don't need them.
[187:23.59]Break them down.
[187:26.37]Security blade.
[187:27.25]Break it down.
[187:27.85]This ore.
[187:33.00]Ooh, that's pretty good.
[187:35.78]Okay, get rid of it.
[187:36.80]I have the tactical shotgun.
[187:38.28]Just get rid of it.
[187:40.11]Tactical shotgun.
[187:40.81]I'm not going to use it.
[187:41.61]I really am not.
[187:42.29]I already have one.
[187:44.59]Light pistol.
[187:45.27]I already have one.
[187:46.82]Assault rifle.
[187:49.56]I already have something better.
[187:53.11]My shovel, I might need it for anything.
[187:55.97]Okay, what about armor?
[187:58.13]Look at all this crap.
[188:02.45]I'm alright, I'm not encumbered anymore.
[188:03.93]Alright, so now... Pen door, eliminate the outlaws, and I wanted to wrap the dawn thing.
[188:11.85]I need to find one more of those canisters.
[188:22.12]Scream if you see a canister.
[188:23.34]It's important.
[188:34.65]It's the fastest way for me to time people out without doing anything.
[188:37.33]Hello.
[188:38.27]How do you get in there?
[188:51.16]Oh, like this.
[189:02.36]I smite you in the name of the law.
[189:06.57]I need to be using my other pistol.
[189:10.35]Alright, give me another canister.
[189:12.33]I'm not ready to leave yet.
[189:13.43]Who the fuck are you?
[189:21.12]uh your damn turncoat we saw everything so what do we do guys um should we go negotiate what do you think what should the three dentists need to come to an agreement here
[189:48.68]battery levels are fully charged thank you customer you don't have any info we guarantee it's the only sanitation and maintenance unit you'll ever need okay back to work I'm gonna be ready I'm I'm ready now okay here we go
[190:17.61]Door closes.
[190:18.59]Door opens and it's a guy with grenade launcher now.
[190:23.05]It wasn't me.
[190:23.79]Ease off the trigger.
[190:24.97]Hear me out.
[190:25.43]Nobody needs to die, least of all me.
[190:43.13]Ezo, hear me out for a second.
[190:44.49]You got one minute.
[190:46.21]Starting now.
[190:47.33]Somebody's walking around with a mask.
[190:49.61]I convinced Cassandra to let you leave in peace.
[190:51.79]The lab's a wreck.
[190:52.57]The staff's half dead.
[190:54.56]The outlaws just want to leave.
[190:55.58]Let them go.
[190:56.76]Yeah, I mean, I convinced Cassandra to let you leave in peace.
[191:01.22]You convinced her to let us leave in peace.
[191:04.66]Listing the ills we've been done ain't exactly putting me in a mind to compromise.
[191:10.54]Yeah, look around.
[191:13.03]I can't change what's done.
[191:13.93]I can change what happens from here.
[191:15.25]Just walk out.
[191:25.80]I think it can be easy if you decide to let it be.
[191:29.44]I don't think walking away from a fight is ever easy.
[191:31.32]Cassandra can't win.
[191:32.22]You can't win.
[191:33.66]Why throw more lives away?
[191:35.35]I'm the one that wins.
[191:37.46]Neither of you get to win.
[191:38.86]This is my video game.
[191:39.96]That was easy.
[191:40.50]That was very easy.
[191:41.02]That was extraordinarily easy.
[192:17.83]What is going on outside?
[192:19.60]What happened?
[192:20.28]Who fucked?
[192:21.06]Did they think they got attacked?
[192:48.59]For all they know, the person in front of this person turned around and shot him.
[192:56.09]So then it was like, gun out, gun out, gun out, put it down, put it down.
[192:59.29]And did they all just kill each other?
[193:04.50]That's fucking ridiculous.
[193:06.00]Okay, well, we're still, we're good.
[193:09.36]We, don't worry, we cosplay of chaos.
[193:20.79]Go check?
[193:24.35]Hold on.
[193:24.69]No, don't open that door!
[193:30.46]Eliminate the outlaws.
[193:33.27]Okay.
[193:34.03]We have a poison dagger?
[193:45.81]One of the recruits, one of those random guards was like a spy.
[193:52.71]See, all I needed to do was just sow the Discord.
[193:55.67]I didn't need to do anything.
[193:58.02]Okay.
[193:59.02]I need another canister!
[194:03.32]Look, I'm one second away from just blowing you away.
[194:07.38]Where's a canister?
[194:16.20]I need one more of these damn things.
[194:23.94]This is in the room.
[194:29.61]Is there one in the raptor room?
[194:34.89]Not that I can see.
[194:42.25]They're just eating people up here.
[194:44.67]Damn it.
[194:45.85]I want to do this.
[194:49.70]It's in one of the closets in the back.
[194:51.76]Really?
[194:55.58]How do I tell them to stop?
[194:56.68]Like, stay?
[194:57.20]Don't move.
[194:59.58]Just stay.
[195:13.96]Okay, so... You're telling me there's one down here?
[195:24.95]What about in here?
[195:27.93]No.
[195:28.91]Shit, okay.
[195:34.10]No, this is dangerous.
[195:35.30]This is too dangerous.
[195:36.44]I'm out.
[195:40.86]Follow me.
[195:46.18]You're not talking about in here, are you?
[195:48.16]Not in this one, are you?
[195:55.88]You're talking about in there.
[195:56.86]Okay, let me try it once.
[195:58.90]If I can't do this, then I can't do it.
[196:02.43]But I'm going to try to sneak.
[196:11.05]Oh, shit.
[196:11.59]Oh, shit.
[196:12.09]Okay, hold on.
[196:15.81]Shh.
[196:16.33]Stop.
[196:16.53]Oh, fuck.
[196:16.97]I'm spotted.
[196:17.63]Dude, he didn't scream.
[196:18.75]He just screamed.
[196:19.55]It's over here.
[196:20.21]Yep, it is over here.
[196:44.36]Alright, let's see, can I just, can I do it?
[196:45.78]Alright, let me out!
[196:52.78]Close the door!
[196:58.24]Okay, help.
[196:59.58]Is it gonna happen?
[197:04.36]Shit!
[197:08.86]Where's the, where's the mother?
[197:12.49]I thought I could do it from this terminal.
[197:14.23]Alright, save the game.
[197:26.76]Turn around.
[197:27.44]Go that way.
[197:29.04]Go eat that body.
[197:29.86]Okay, ventilate gas.
[197:43.24]It's hitting me too.
[197:57.63]Okay.
[197:57.91]Can I breathe this in?
[198:04.46]What?
[198:04.80]What's going on?
[198:05.36]What?
[198:05.60]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[198:09.84]What's going on?
[198:12.08]I don't have to pick it up and deliver it?
[198:17.26]I thought he was like, keep that mother alive and bring her to me in one piece.
[198:22.28]That's not what happened?
[198:23.02]I just have to knock them out.
[198:35.67]They just had to sleep.
[198:38.65]Oh, I thought I was doing this for a very specific reason.
[198:48.33]Okay.
[198:50.16]We're in fucking combat.
[198:51.44]God damn it.
[198:52.04]Why are you guys following me out here?
[198:57.20]So there's no reason to do this.
[199:03.86]This is just like a second way to do the exact same thing.
[199:08.47]That's kind of boring.
[199:09.33]No, there's extra money.
[199:14.03]Yeah, it has to be.
[199:32.59]Alright, let's go!
[199:36.59]So they'll just come get it.
[199:37.99]I get it.
[199:38.65]Okay.
[199:38.95]Eliminate the outlaws.
[199:41.69]Part 2.
[199:47.83]Wait.
[199:50.73]Eliminate the outlaws.
[199:56.30]Oh, you are an outlaw.
[199:57.22]Yeah, right.
[199:58.66]Uh...
[200:06.78]We're gonna have to do a meeting of the dentists over here, I think.
[200:09.89]Dentist huddle.
[200:11.71]So, um... Where's my money?
[200:22.71]I've never been so pleased at the sight of an open door.
[200:26.64]Please tell me you've cleared a way out of here.
[200:33.38]Ask away.
[200:33.90]I have got nothing but time.
[200:39.77]What do you intend to do with this research?
[200:40.91]Sell it, of course.
[200:42.57]I don't have any use for the scribblings of idiotic scientists.
[200:45.68]But whoever gave me this tip obviously does.
[200:48.24]Assuming I make it out of this place alive.
[200:51.08]And with my ship out of commission, I'll have to leave on foot and hope my luck changes.
[200:56.00]One problem at a time, I suppose.
[200:59.12]Uh... You act like the corporations are your enemy.
[201:03.06]What do you have against them?
[201:04.18]From the day we are born, we are made to obey.
[201:07.40]Never question.
[201:08.79]Never hope.
[201:10.27]Never dream of anything greater than a lot appointed to us.
[201:14.62]And in your case, never doing an honest day's work, apparently.
[201:17.72]That's right.
[201:18.20]Never a dentist's day's work.
[201:22.48]But they could not give a half-bit shit about our lives.
[201:29.06]Why would you and your crew raid on... I can't throw a fellow dentist under the bus.
[201:32.76]That's not how this works.
[201:34.04]The establishment tells us to live here, work there, eat that, drink this.
[201:39.52]She's an anti-dentist, yeah.
[201:40.44]She's talking shit about us right now.
[201:42.08]I don't know.
[202:10.09]She's a cavity.
[202:14.37]You can't... I'm sorry, but you cannot expect me to throw a fellow dentist under the bus.
[202:22.04]Yeah.
[202:22.70]Go ahead.
[202:23.04]Mm-hmm.
[202:48.34]Ender!
[202:49.96]Nice shot, fellow dentist!
[202:57.20]Oh no!
[203:05.81]That was easy!
[203:13.66]You know what?
[203:14.06]Fuck it.
[203:14.34]I'm not gonna give you a chance.
[203:17.32]This is for the dentists.
[203:18.79]Are you gonna steal the toothpaste on us?
[203:21.59]Don't think so.
[203:22.39]Owner not found.
[203:45.00]Get the reward?
[203:46.06]What do you mean the reward?
[203:50.90]I have a duty.
[203:52.61]Okay, why don't we just keep her locked in there?
[203:55.09]Reward, then kill.
[203:56.25]What do you mean the reward?
[204:01.63]She's gonna...
[204:12.97]Here, don't make me regret it.
[204:14.23]No, we're going to let this settle.
[204:22.16]The dentist shit is high right now.
[204:25.98]We have a lot of tension here.
[204:27.80]We've got three dentists versus an anti-dentist.
[204:31.97]I'm going to take the reward.
[204:34.09]Take care of yourself out there.
[204:37.65]Keep the research.
[204:38.31]I want the reward.
[204:39.07]And we'll see you later.

[205:25.81]Get the plans from her first!
[205:27.67]Oh, god damn it!
[205:30.51]Wait!
[205:32.65]What's that save?
[205:34.27]This doesn't look right.
[205:36.11]This looks incorrect.

[206:37.54]Alright, we're good.
[206:41.02]Alright, so don't vaporize her.
[206:44.01]Kill her with the revolver.
[206:55.31]Talk to her first.
[206:57.03]Get the reward first.
[206:58.11]There is no reward.
[206:59.09]What do you mean there is?
[207:01.23]Hold on.
[207:01.61]I've got questions for you.
[207:02.59]Okay.
[207:14.38]How did you end up in this video?
[207:15.14]Act like the quote.
[207:15.64]Why would you in your... What do you intend to do with this room?
[207:17.85]What are you talking about?
[207:18.49]Sell it, of course.
[207:20.07]I don't have any use for the scribblings of idiotic scientists.
[207:23.17]But whoever gave me this tip obviously does.
[207:25.75]Assuming I make it out of this place alive.
[207:28.57]And with my... Dentist.
[207:30.23]I'll have to leave on foot and hope my luck changes.
[207:32.93]Okay.
[207:33.51]One problem at a time, I suppose.
[207:37.15]Uh... I've cleared the path.
[207:39.56]Don't make me regret it.
[207:40.94]So you have.
[207:43.08]I am much obliged.
[207:44.07]I did not do this for free.
[207:45.53]And now, if you do not mind, I have had quite enough of this wretched place.
[207:51.21]Well, I didn't save your life for free.
[207:52.57]Good.
[207:53.91]I never trust a freelancer who works for free.
[207:56.63]If you're good at something, never do it for free.
[207:58.29]Come on.
[207:59.49]You're going to throw in a little extra for the orphans.
[208:03.42]Orphans?
[208:04.88]Is that what you are calling yourself now?
[208:08.00]Here.
[208:09.22]Let it never be said that I do not reward good work.
[208:12.33]No, you don't.
[208:13.67]And I'm going to need you to turn over that research.
[208:19.95]Data's worthless.
[208:24.88]A situation's liable to turn ugly if you don't.
[208:27.88]Because you don't want a price on your head.
[208:29.18]Also, I went out of the way for you.
[208:31.66]You know, it's going to turn ugly if you don't.
[208:36.39]It's just, you know, it's worthless.
[208:37.73]That's what I was told.
[208:39.57]You did the right thing.
[208:41.96]The strong survive and the weak perish.
[209:22.05]High five.
[209:22.49]Yeah, never fuck with the dentists.
[209:23.77]What'd you have on you?
[209:24.59]You lying to me?
[209:25.05]Did you give me everything?
[209:26.29]Good.
[209:51.89]Got what I wanted.
[209:52.57]Got what I came for.
[209:54.81]Let's get out of here.
[210:01.08]Doom that came to Rose.
[210:02.22]Speak to Anton.
[210:04.08]Talk to Anton.
[210:05.44]Search for secrets.
[210:07.22]Okay, I've done everything.
[210:09.26]Except for this Dr. Wanda.
[210:11.02]But, fuck it.
[210:11.98]We don't even need to do that.
[210:12.88]Let's go.
[210:21.47]Here's something I learned in prison.
[210:27.45]There were three kind of fucked up dentists.
[210:39.64]We're going to have to have a quick meeting at the dentist.
[211:10.94]That person was hostile!
[211:19.50]That was an NPC, she had a red name!
[211:34.01]Like that, see?
[211:41.97]Who the fuck are you?
[211:42.85]Shoot the thing with the explosive.
[211:52.65]There it is.
[212:06.75]We good?
[212:12.44]Come and get it.
[212:14.66]Yeah, they were interfering with official dentist business.
[212:20.34]Where did that person go?
[212:27.21]What?
[212:33.63]Why am I so hurt?
[212:35.91]DOGS!
[212:37.77]Where was the save point?
[213:09.87]Okay, let's do this again.
[213:13.11]Fast travel.
[213:14.05]Good idea.
[213:15.09]What an excellent idea.
[213:16.05]Alright.
[213:27.24]Let's go back, talk to Anton.
[213:29.58]Damn right we left the lab.
[213:31.28]What's left there that's worth dying for?
[213:32.90]Oh shit, I forgot about these people.
[213:34.60]You let them get away.
[213:36.58]Worthless.
[213:37.41]The lot of you.
[213:39.36]Well, you get what you pay for, don't you?
[213:45.78]I heard there was some trouble out in the front of the building there.
[213:48.84]Doc Crane better get over himself.
[213:54.77]It's fucked up what happened.
[213:55.77]I heard there was somebody, a spy I heard, and shot somebody with a fuck.
[214:00.25]What?
[214:00.43]That's fucking, that's fucked up.
[214:04.69]That no account fool Porter and his crew are even more worthless than I could have imagined.
[214:09.33]They've abandoned their posts.
[214:11.47]This is madness.
[214:14.16]Okay.
[214:16.18]I can't believe this is all about toothpaste.
[214:21.04]I have your research, but I'm keeping it.
[214:23.40]I'm the real dentist.
[214:28.21]I found your associate, James, and he's safe.
[214:31.41]That is wonderful news.
[214:33.45]I feared the worst.
[214:38.16]You know, there's more to care about than black marks and paperwork.
[214:42.92]Good to hear... It's good to hear that you're... Okay, $1,000.
[214:45.66]Good to hear your employees actually mean more to you than your research.
[214:48.30]Okay.
[214:49.30]What should I mistake it for?
[214:50.60]Compassion?
[215:00.89]If my colleagues refuse to take their lives seriously, why should I?
[215:04.33]All they do is complain.
[215:06.30]They refuse to see the opportunity afforded us here.
[215:09.24]Uh, you just wanted to clear it up that you're a heartless bastard.
[215:15.20]Believe what you will, but I'm not the manipulative, ego-driven person you think me to be.
[215:20.55]I'm not.
[215:23.55]Okay.
[215:28.07]Level up.
[215:30.26]Oh, it's you.
[215:32.94]As if my thoughts weren't dark enough already.
[215:35.96]What is it?
[215:37.15]He turned around pretty quickly.
[215:41.85]I have your research, but I'm going to keep it.
[215:44.83]The outlaws got away with the research.
[215:49.07]Yeah, it was terrible.
[215:51.00]That's all manner of distressing.
[215:54.96]There truly is nothing left for me.
[215:58.07]I suppose I'm, uh, we're finished here.
[216:05.00]Uh, bye.
[216:13.52]I thought that was a gun.
[216:15.98]It's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[216:22.53]Alright.
[216:23.97]So I got some new info.
[216:27.69]I can return to Gladys.
[216:30.61]Go back.
[216:30.94]Yeah, I gotta go back to the... Yeah.
[216:33.84]Let's go back.
[216:54.94]Wait, what?
[216:56.94]Where did you come from?
[216:58.44]Who did this?
[217:01.64]They both died off screen.
[217:15.09]Where is he?
[217:17.41]He's not even in the same room.
[217:18.59]This doesn't make any sense.
[217:20.25]Hold on a second.
[217:20.95]Wait, wait, wait.
[217:21.47]This is important.
[217:34.06]Did you see his face?
[217:39.04]That face was so fucked up.
[217:44.48]No!
[217:52.48]That horror that was on his face.
[217:56.53]That was so horrible.
[217:57.81]I did that because somebody said, do it, Max.
[218:04.94]It's such an elaborate cutscene.
[218:06.88]Okay.
[218:10.64]The true horror.
[218:14.28]Is that Max?
[218:15.02]No.
[218:16.32]Alright.
[218:17.82]So, handguns suck.
[218:23.64]But.
[218:45.05]Okay.
[218:47.31]Meter max.
[218:48.37]That's not bad.
[218:52.09]Companion crit chance.
[218:53.29]That's good because when we have Max do his long cutscene move.
[218:58.03]That's pretty cool.
[219:05.42]That's all we care about now.
[219:08.74]And that opens up tier 2.
[219:09.58]Yeah.
[219:17.46]Okay, we have some new stuff.
[219:22.00]I feel like it always has to be a shotgun, though, because it has so much weight behind it.
[219:28.58]That turn you're back to the camera, spin around, shoot with shotgun is just way cooler.
[219:34.20]I mean, it has to be a shotgun, always.
[219:40.99]And you can use this, too.
[219:46.06]It's always a shotgun.
[219:47.28]Oh, okay.
[219:47.92]Let's level you up.
[219:49.50]Range damage.
[219:52.26]Dialogue combat effect.
[219:53.60]I'm going to have to do range damage, right?
[219:55.55]Because he's going to be doing the shotgun.
[220:01.33]Yeah.
[220:06.29]Ranged DPS.
[220:14.02]And now you...
[220:16.83]are going to be... Reduce negative reputation for kills when Sam is in the party.
[220:23.23]Armor rating.
[220:25.03]Yeah, I want you to be the tank.
[220:33.95]For a second, I thought they already... Okay.
[220:37.27]Let's keep going.
[220:37.75]We're going to go to Gladys now.
[220:42.37]Wait, there's, like, probably stuff I can do in this town.
[220:45.33]A vendor of some sort.
[220:48.03]There's probably something, right?
[220:51.15]I should sell.
[220:51.67]Yeah.
[220:56.08]17th bar.
[220:56.70]Okay.
[220:58.34]Okay.
[221:09.99]That's a good character.
[221:10.83]Alright, what do you got?
[221:11.54]Stop.
[221:12.40]I'm sorry, I bumped you.
[221:13.14]Um... Oh, what do you got?
[221:13.84]Let's see.
[221:15.26]Sell.
[221:15.40]I got a 15% discount.
[221:15.88]Let's just sell the junk.
[221:16.52]4700 bucks.
[221:18.12]What do you have for...
[221:42.42]I need to start mixing stuff.
[221:44.11]I have a lot of random shit.
[221:45.59]I need a third slot.
[221:46.63]How do I get a third slot?
[221:47.43]I have to do medicine again.
[221:54.75]Yeah, I need that third slot.
[221:59.36]I'm going to be working on medical next time.
[222:01.82]And then long rifle.
[222:04.94]We good?
[222:06.70]We are.
[222:08.72]Back to the ship.
[222:18.20]But first.
[222:21.45]I have an apple up here.
[222:23.81]I guess that's okay.
[222:27.11]Tactical time dilation recharge rate plus 50% for 25 seconds.
[222:33.61]Toothpaste.
[222:35.57]Movement speed plus 20%.
[222:37.45]Oh, that's awesome.
[222:38.25]Hold on.
[222:40.84]Movement speed plus 20%.
[222:42.34]Melee weapon attack speed 20%.
[222:44.66]I don't really care about that.
[222:45.52]I care about the movement speed.
[222:53.18]Five Guys is best burgers.
[222:54.74]That's not true.
[222:58.10]That's just... That's completely and totally untrue.
[223:01.08]They're good, but they're not the best.
[223:08.55]They're good.
[223:09.93]I agree with you.
[223:11.65]I would say that they're pretty close to being very good.
[223:17.31]You know?
[223:21.60]But the best burger I've ever had?
[223:23.46]No.
[223:28.58]They're both coming with me.
[223:38.55]Stay still.
[223:39.07]I'm just going to remove some tartar.
[223:42.79]Alright, let's move.
[223:43.99]So, we've got...
[223:55.07]No.
[223:56.86]Were you talking shit?
[224:01.30]The first person to talk shit is going to get a max.
[224:07.87]Wait, is this unauthorized?
[224:08.81]I don't know.
[224:11.73]Alright.
[224:12.81]I don't know.
[224:14.35]Gladys.
[224:15.58]So what do I have to do?
[224:20.49]Gladys mentions that June Lee Tennyson, the Groundbreaker's captain, is always willing to put available captain's work.
[224:24.67]You can check the bounty board and the docking bay for work.
[224:28.53]I mean, I kind of already did everything.
[224:30.57]What do you do with that?
[224:31.49]Just go to Gladys.
[224:38.78]Where is it?
[224:39.12]Am I going to go down?
[224:40.06]Okay.
[224:50.17]Alright.
[224:51.81]Gladys.
[224:54.11]I've got some stuff for you.
[224:58.91]Let's talk.
[224:59.59]I investigated that distress signal from Roseway.
[225:18.18]About those... Bug under your desk?
[225:29.35]Secrets.
[225:35.24]I found this fancy toothpaste formula.
[225:37.02]Here you go.
[225:38.64]A nice scientific dental lye.
[225:40.44]I found a formula for experimental rocket fuel.
[225:43.00]Seems like pretty advanced stuff.
[225:46.55]I found schematics for a prototype weapon from Forrest that I'm selling you buying.
[225:55.24]That's a pretty good science lie.
[225:56.52]What are you giving me?
[225:57.60]Three thousand.
[226:14.54]I found schematics for a prototype weapon from Force and I'm selling you buying it.
[226:25.84]Yeah.
[226:26.20]Give me more money.
[226:26.82]1,500 more bits.
[226:41.99]How can I be sure you won't go ratting me out to the wrong people?
[226:45.46]Okay.
[226:48.18]I think that's it.
[226:49.30]Um...
[227:07.72]I don't think there's anything left for me to do.
[227:10.40]So, tell me what I want to know.
[227:12.80]What did I want to know?
[227:22.93]Be sure to come back for magazine club.
[227:27.07]Okay, bye.
[227:28.01]Anytime, sweetheart.
[227:29.73]You know where to find me.
[227:32.69]Oh, this person.
[227:34.79]Right, okay.
[227:38.67]You sold the toothpaste formula- WHAT?!
[227:44.57]Oh, right, yes it did.
[227:45.75]Well, dentist has to make money somehow.
[227:53.73]Okay.
[227:53.99]Let's go- let's go talk to, uh, Jun Lee.
[228:03.87]Wait, this is illegal.
[228:06.61]Oh, fuck if I care.
[228:09.35]Whose key do I have?
[228:10.41]Okay, I'm not allowed to be in here.
[228:12.35]Close the damn door.
[228:13.51]Get in here.
[228:14.49]Dentist meeting.
[228:19.15]Holy shit.
[228:26.52]Whose stuff is this?
[228:29.20]I don't know.
[228:30.20]Whose key do I have?
[228:48.20]Oh, I can't get that.
[228:48.98]Open this one.
[228:54.46]Holy shit.
[228:59.19]It's all so... There's so much stuff.
[229:04.27]Okay.
[229:05.41]Alright.
[229:12.48]I can get another rest and go keycard.
[229:17.71]Cool.
[229:19.90]Why don't they just let me... Oh, fuck, this is your business.
[229:22.54]Imagine hearing somebody go into your back room and yell out, hey, we're having a dentist meeting in here, closing the door.
[229:32.31]Why would you let us go in there?
[229:44.18]Alright.
[229:45.84]Uh, there's Gladys.
[229:46.76]Let's go over to General Lee Tenson.
[229:52.25]I know she's in there, Empuru.
[229:55.95]Hmm?
[229:59.81]Who?
[230:03.07]You can't keep me out of there.
[230:05.37]Please don't make a scene, Dr. Fenhill.
[230:09.00]I am not making a scene.
[230:12.86]Doctors?
[230:14.32]You know, I used to be a doctor.
[230:16.85]I was just like you.
[230:18.73]And then I decided to put on a green shirt and I became a dentist.
[230:23.65]And let me tell you, it is so much better.
[230:27.83]You think you're tough waving that thing around?
[230:29.93]Yeah, I'm waving around.
[230:30.87]I'm flexing on you.
[230:33.17]How much money did you make in the last week?
[230:35.35]I had two crowns and I had a couple of implants to do.
[230:40.51]That's $60,000 in four days.
[230:45.81]Uh, what's going on?
[230:47.00]Maybe I can look into it.
[230:48.28]I was a doctor.
[231:17.83]Be my guest.
[231:18.97]If you know something I don't about dealing with hospital bureaucracy, I'll be impressed.
[231:24.26]You're talking to the right person.
[231:25.82]You, open that door.
[231:27.92]Hey, doctor.
[231:30.08]Hey, doctor.
[231:32.14]Open that door.
[231:33.60]What seems to be the problem?
[231:37.35]I'd like to see Jesse Doyle, please.
[231:39.25]If only my other patients had so many inquiring after them.
[231:43.67]I'll tell you what I've told the others.
[231:46.18]The records say Ms.
[231:47.56]Doyle checked herself in and requested I admit no visitors.
[231:51.30]Requests of our patients are paramount, so no, you may not see her.
[231:58.67]The records say you actually spoken to her yourself.
[232:01.85]She's not my patient.
[232:03.69]I'm certain no one on my staff would falsify patient records, if that's what you're implying.
[232:09.81]It is.
[232:13.18]Take care.
[232:15.92]Have a good day, doctor.
[232:23.31]Fucking loser.
[232:24.13]I go where I want.
[232:34.15]I'm a stand-up dentist.
[232:38.27]I was gonna say I'm a comedian.
[232:39.53]Whatever.
[232:42.67]Is a doctor really smoking inside of a hospital?
[232:45.99]Are you fucking kidding me?
[232:48.03]Dentists wouldn't do that.
[232:50.17]Guarantee it.
[232:50.69]Oh, I've learned that interstellar crew is called conditioned skip flu.
[232:57.37]And everyone... Yep.
[232:59.78]Somebody screenshot that.
[233:00.68]Alright, where are they?
[233:11.35]Pick up marred ID cartridge.
[233:16.59]You found an ID cartridge used with the holographic shroud.
[233:18.85]You will now be automatically disguised by entering the associated restricted area.
[233:23.73]That was very, very simple.
[233:25.23]I guess I'm now... Your holographic shroud is activated, giving you temporary access to this restricted area.
[233:33.62]Moving drains the Shroud's energy and when it runs out, personnel will see and interrogate you.
[233:38.26]Talk your way out of the interrogation to reset your Shroud.
[233:41.02]It'll get harder to talk your way out the more you're interrogated.
[233:46.13]What?
[233:48.51]Why do you look like you're about to fucking take a swing at me?
[233:56.66]Okay, so I'm pretending to be a doctor.
[233:59.60]We're looking for Jesse?
[234:03.57]Where's Jesse?
[234:04.35]Looking for Jesse?
[234:05.03]Okay, if I... Do I have to pick this lock?
[234:07.47]I'm gonna pick the lock.
[234:08.11]This is probably Jesse's room.
[234:33.13]nobody in here well there's a lot okay I I might not have been worth it but how do I replenish the shroud Jesse Jesse Jesse
[234:58.58]Shh.
[234:59.24]I'm not actually a doctor.
[235:01.14]I'm a stealth dentist.
[235:02.76]Ellie sent me.
[235:04.41]Shh.
[235:04.61]I'm not actually a doctor.
[235:09.83]I'm a dentist.
[235:24.82]Dentists don't take shit.
[235:26.68]Open the door before I fucking knock it down.
[235:28.86]Hmm.
[235:29.02]Hmm.
[235:52.56]Are you disguised?
[235:53.04]What does that mean?
[235:54.10]Why does she have like a crumpled up piece of trash under her name?
[235:56.94]Did everybody get in here?
[236:19.91]The truth is, I'm not sick.
[236:21.55]But if you repeat what I'm about to tell you to anyone, I will deny it with my dying breath.
[236:25.88]You, uh, ain't with the board, are you?
[236:28.36]No.
[236:28.58]See, I owe them.
[236:29.82]A lot.
[236:30.78]I might have missed a payment or two, and the other night I swear someone was following me back to my room.
[236:35.29]So I hold up here to lay low.
[236:36.59]In front of the guard?
[236:37.75]Uh... You know, I do work for the board, actually.
[236:47.35]Oh, Laws.
[236:48.39]Wait, don't gut me and skin me yet.
[236:50.41]Please, talk to Bedford.
[236:52.01]Tell him I can pay, um, a part of it.
[236:54.88]And I'm a useful person to know.
[236:56.32]Just ask Ellie.
[236:58.14]Surely you wouldn't drag me before him.
[237:00.20]I'm dreadful contagious.
[237:01.54]I just know if I face him, I'm dead.
[237:06.87]I'll talk to him for you.
[237:08.69]Thanks for helping me with the board.
[237:10.33]You're a real pal.
[237:12.29]Or I guess I should say, Ellie is one, huh?
[237:15.11]You're welcome, by the way.
[237:19.54]You're welcome.
[237:23.60]Okay, okay, we saw it.
[237:45.01]I didn't know it was gonna be outside.
[237:55.63]Oh, wait, no!
[238:02.65]Nothing at all!
[238:04.17]I'm doing what- I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm doing what the fuck I want.
[238:07.47]Wait, what?
[238:29.54]If you do it twice, you can't do it twice.
[238:37.24]It's not Fallout.
[238:38.16]Fuck!
[238:38.56]That's right, it's a different game.
[238:40.80]Alright, goodbye.
[238:45.87]Now, let's go talk to... Worst Contact.
[238:52.63]Which is this way.
[238:54.17]Can I leave this way?
[238:56.47]Who cares if my disguise is gone?
[239:02.39]Uh oh.
[239:24.15]We made it.
[239:24.57]Let's go.
[239:35.15]Uh-huh.
[239:37.03]She's in debt to the board and thinks someone's after her.
[239:39.01]I'll handle it.
[239:39.93]Yeah, I crossed over the border.
[239:41.17]You have no jurisdiction when I go through the red gel.
[239:43.41]Alright, let's go fuck this guy up.
[240:06.01]Remember me?
[240:06.43]I'm here about Jessie Doyle.
[240:08.21]I want her debt settled.
[240:08.73]Can't she work for you until she earns back what she owes?
[240:37.47]I believe the captain is proposing an indenture contract.
[240:42.87]I didn't say nothing about her teeth.
[240:44.87]I would know.
[240:45.55]She's got to be worth more than alive than dead.
[240:48.50]You should know that, dentist.
[240:50.22]That's not unreasonable.
[240:52.40]What guarantee do I have that she'll agree to the terms you negotiate?
[240:57.10]She's hiding in sickbay to avoid assassins.
[240:58.80]I'm sure she'll prefer work.
[241:00.67]Doesn't have a choice.
[241:02.33]Doesn't show up for work, kill her like you planned on in the first place.
[241:07.26]Hmm.
[241:08.50]I'm not sure the price of her organs will allow a profit in that case.
[241:11.90]I expect her liver is, uh, used goods, as it were.
[241:16.40]I will recall my collection agent.
[241:18.50]Tell Miss Doyle to report to me promptly for her first assignment.
[241:22.11]Now, is there anything else you need, or can I return to my work?
[241:28.41]No, go ahead.
[241:28.91]Do your thing.
[241:30.31]Do your thing.
[241:36.01]Not gonna do it.
[241:38.28]I'm not- I'm not gonna- you can always tell when he saves.
[241:41.20]Yes, I just said when he saves.
[241:45.02]Then I'm gonna press the C button.
[241:48.04]There's smokes in this game.
[241:48.98]Is this like 2000 years in the future?
[241:51.24]Cigarettes people still think are cool?
[241:53.82]I think they would've been like phased out in like 2000- like 140.
[242:07.86]Got word from Udam, from the hitman who trailed me the other night.
[242:11.80]Seems I'm indentured to the board now.
[242:13.88]Yes, you are.
[242:14.80]I ain't too elated about going exclusive, but it's better than winding up dead.
[242:18.60]Yes, it is.
[242:19.20]You sure saved my skin, stranger.
[242:21.42]All debts between me and Ellie are cleared.
[242:23.58]Good.
[242:26.70]Watch yourself.
[242:28.86]Now you.
[242:30.14]The good news came through the wireless.
[242:32.00]Looks like you paid my debt to Jesse.
[242:34.58]I guess that means I owe you now, right?
[242:36.96]We're always looking for new doctors and dentists.
[242:39.53]But.
[243:00.23]You're a doc.
[243:01.05]She's a doctor, not a dentist.
[243:01.81]I was a doctor before I was a dentist.
[243:02.87]All of us were.
[243:03.35]We just had to put on green.
[243:04.17]Welcome aboard, Ellie.
[243:05.63]Your green scrubs are in your locker.
[243:07.09]Meet me on my ship.
[243:08.15]It's docked in the promenade.
[243:09.11]Uh...
[243:31.98]Yeah, meet me at the ship.
[243:32.94]How to be in green.
[243:33.64]Alright.
[244:02.93]More skill points.
[244:03.85]What did I say I wanted to do?
[244:05.91]I said I wanted to do more medicine, right?
[244:09.62]A third drug slot.
[244:11.06]That's going to take a while.
[244:12.60]Damn it.
[244:14.70]I need to do more damage.
[244:15.50]We're going to do long guns.
[244:26.80]Alright.
[244:28.26]So, I was doing this.
[244:31.10]I kind of just gave up on it.
[244:45.89]Greasy?
[244:51.47]Bounty drone.
[244:52.49]Cool.
[244:54.51]How do I get in there?
[244:58.15]Auntie's kitchen keycard.
[245:03.63]How do I get into where you... Oh, there's a giant hatch.
[245:10.15]Thought there'd be more machinery.
[245:12.24]Must be housed on a sub-level.
[245:13.96]What happened to the cool priest?
[245:16.04]I'm sorry.
[245:19.36]There's no longer a priest.
[245:21.22]There's a dentist.
[245:23.41]Two of them, actually.
[245:27.81]Hey.
[245:30.17]Junlei Tennyson.
[245:31.39]I'm captain around here, but chief to my friends.
[245:33.85]Hope you don't mind the formal introduction.
[245:35.94]Groundbreaker doesn't see many visitors.
[245:39.85]Junko nice place you got here.
[245:41.51]I'm captain of the unreliable recently unshackled from groundbreakers impound Good for you.
[245:48.32]Hope you scared some sense into those bureaucrats giving you trouble Just so we understand each other I'm the final word on the ship the martyrs the crew the engineers their family I hope there won't be any problems while you're visiting I
[246:05.84]I'll do whatever I can to help.
[246:07.24]Don't go making trouble.
[246:08.24]And chances are, you won't find any.
[246:10.02]That's how I like it here.
[246:12.34]Yes, sure.
[246:13.56]I'm curious, even though nine times out of ten, the answer is just passing through.
[246:22.28]Statistics don't lie.
[246:24.28]We see a lot of the same faces coming and going.
[246:26.82]Most of them board spies and corporate trusts.
[246:29.23]Makes it hard to trust outsiders.
[246:31.65]You seem different.
[246:32.91]So welcome aboard.
[246:36.32]Uh, you don't have a lot of faith in the board.
[246:37.50]What's it like being in command?
[246:38.62]It seems kind of warm in here.
[246:40.28]You don't have a lot of faith in the board, do you?
[246:41.60]You're right.
[246:42.22]I don't.
[246:43.20]The board is after two things.
[246:44.82]Bits and power.
[246:46.02]And they only get it by sticking their nose where it doesn't belong.
[246:50.92]You must not like Bedford very much.
[246:52.70]I like to think of myself as a nice person.
[246:55.14]But if that gaudy embassy of his was on fire, I might hold my breath a moment before activating the sprinkler system.
[247:01.79]The board wants control over Groundbreaker, and leeches like Udam Bedford will do anything to please their corporate masters.
[247:11.86]How do you keep the board at a safe distance?
[247:13.14]I placate them when I have something to offer, but I can also be a real hard ass.
[247:17.20]It'd be a joy if I could kick out the corporate merchants and reclaim the docking fees in my lifetime.
[247:22.82]Too much of Groundbreaker's income is flowing in the wrong direction.
[247:26.19]I'd like to see that change.
[247:30.09]Okay.
[247:30.41]Well, what do I- what do you want?
[247:34.02]What's it like being in command?
[247:35.08]Okay.
[247:50.92]Okay, what is it?
[247:51.52]Family business?
[247:53.28]And my grandfather, Ben.
[247:54.82]He left behind a really weird watch that we didn't know what to do with.
[247:58.08]We brought it to Antiques Roadshow and they said it was $44.
[248:00.89]So we sold it.
[248:01.51]We didn't know what it was.
[248:02.71]It was in a shoebox upstairs.
[248:21.40]It was different knowing that I couldn't turn to anyone who could answer the tough questions for me.
[248:26.20]Maybe you can see why I'm protective of Groundbreaker.
[248:28.97]This ship is family.
[248:30.53]It's got tinkerings and bypasses that only Tennisons know about.
[248:35.73]Where's the self-destruct mechanism?
[248:37.03]I hope that was a joke, Captain.
[248:38.52]I really do.
[248:40.12]I yelled at that thing years ago.
[248:41.52]It wasn't.
[248:41.90]It wasn't.
[248:42.20]Where is it?
[248:42.66]Where's the exploding button?
[248:47.74]Aren't you a little young?
[248:48.76]Okay.
[248:49.16]It seems warm in here.
[248:49.62]Yep.
[248:49.80]And there we go.
[248:50.24]Here it is.
[248:50.52]Here it is.
[249:15.03]Only the board has access to new parts.
[249:17.01]Go install AC into the window.
[249:19.89]Sure thing.
[249:23.65]They want us to sweat, thinking that'll soften me up for a bad faith deal.
[249:27.75]If you'll excuse me, they can go fuck themselves.
[249:31.36]The board isn't helping and my resources are spread thin.
[249:34.32]If I don't get those radiators back online, Groundbreaker, everyone aboard, will be cooked alive.
[249:42.50]You need a contractor.
[249:44.93]I could do this easily.
[249:45.59]Uh... Where the hell is that?
[249:46.25]Hmm.
[250:14.29]Have you tried sending anyone else down there?
[250:16.05]I'll get those parts.
[250:16.89]Okay.
[250:18.29]Whatever.
[250:18.49]I'm not doing it for free.
[250:19.35]That's her family heirloom book.
[250:20.85]It's mine now.
[250:51.62]Just download all of her data.
[250:57.41]Alright, got it all.
[250:57.99]I can't get in the back room.
[251:08.19]That was, uh, nothing.
[251:08.85]Okay, goodbye.
[251:22.80]Now we need to go to... Alright.
[251:26.34]Where's this thing?
[251:27.06]What's going on?
[251:29.44]You need to get a few parts for the radiator.
[251:31.38]God, I've got to do all kinds of bullshit.
[251:37.80]The incompetence of people in RPGs is seriously mind-bending.
[251:48.47]It's called a quest.
[251:49.63]No, it's called running errands for people.
[251:53.72]They call it a quest to make it sound cooler so you'll want to do it.
[252:01.12]Can we talk?
[252:06.84]Look at this ripe piece of meat just sizzling on the grill.
[252:12.17]Yum, yum.
[252:14.15]Time to feed the flames.
[252:16.55]It's nothing personal, promise.
[252:20.12]You won't.
[252:20.62]We'll be good.
[252:21.26]Nothing personal, kid.
[252:22.45]Put that down before you incinerate the entire... You're only getting out of this alive if you play nice.
[252:27.05]Yeah.
[252:44.73]Look at the courage on this one lay it on me boss.
[252:48.33]Give me a taste of that fiery primal spirit I'm just here for some parts Kid Tennyson just keeps feeding the furnace.
[253:01.23]Don't shake We're still playing with her last sacrifice out back with the crew.
[253:06.54]Oh
[253:09.86]You don't just ask a king for a favor when you're standing in his court.
[253:15.50]You bring tribute.
[253:17.36]Sacrifices.
[253:19.00]Prophecy.
[253:20.68]Shit like that.
[253:22.45]Under its skin, this ship is all poison and darkness.
[253:27.29]Lead bones.
[253:27.67]Asbestos muscle.
[253:39.49]Maybe you're right.
[253:41.01]You've got the run of the kingdom.
[253:43.07]Up those stairs, you'll find the parts.
[253:45.19]My crew won't get in your way.
[253:48.19]There's something else, though.
[253:49.07]Lay it on me, boss.
[253:50.67]I'm good for it.
[253:53.69]Never mind.
[253:54.12]I was gonna say I can take your money.
[253:55.08]You can come and go in my little kingdom.
[253:57.22]Just try not to piss off any of the gestures.
[254:01.66]Thank you.
[254:06.54]Dirty.
[254:07.66]Dirty.
[254:07.92]Dirty.
[254:08.94]Good thing I didn't have to fight anybody.
[254:12.10]Do you guys see the power of line?
[254:13.94]Can I go... Where am I going?
[254:15.02]This way?
[254:15.34]What else is down here?
[254:16.44]Holy shit.
[254:16.68]I can just take whatever I want.
[254:17.46]No, I can't.
[254:44.20]Damn.
[254:45.88]Well, just look at how many people are here.
[254:49.78]I gotta go up.
[254:52.26]Ladder somewhere?
[254:52.90]Can I jump up here?
[254:54.58]Can I go on a platform?
[254:58.92]Go up?
[254:59.54]Do I have to press a button?
[255:01.16]Or can I run?
[255:02.46]Or is there a stairwell or something?
[255:05.54]Yes.
[255:10.76]Save and kill them.
[255:11.46]Why would I do that?
[255:13.48]You wanna kill these guys now?
[255:16.80]Alright.
[255:17.14]Alright, I got your part.
[255:23.80]This would've taken a long time.
[255:27.50]I'm so glad I could just walk through.
[255:46.41]That was so simple.
[255:51.72]Didn't have to do anything.
[256:00.54]Skip that whole portion.
[256:04.18]I've got a part for you.
[256:06.62]You've returned.
[256:07.63]And in one piece.
[256:08.89]Color me impressed.
[256:12.17]Now what?
[256:13.35]Uh... Alright.
[256:13.75]Fine.
[256:42.19]I'm alright with this.
[256:43.97]The League of Extraordinary Dentists.
[256:46.83]We use our powers for good sometimes.
[256:48.41]These are like little snakes?
[257:13.43]What the hell are those?
[257:22.35]Nice.
[257:24.21]Ooh, up in smoke.
[257:25.85]There's one more up here.
[257:33.36]Where is he?
[257:34.50]Is he invisible?
[257:37.44]Where is this thing?
[257:52.20]What the fuck?
[257:54.96]Come on up!
[257:56.10]Sneak.
[257:56.44]If you like Jerma, say PogChamp.
[257:59.24]Prepare for... Watch out, Captain!
[258:23.46]I'm kind of just going in.
[258:30.75]Alright.
[258:32.05]I guess we'll just go in.
[258:37.97]Sneak.
[258:39.03]Don't fight if you don't need to.
[258:39.93]Can it see us?
[258:50.42]Oh!
[259:03.63]Dead.
[259:04.69]You guys are good.
[259:05.39]I don't know what to do.
[259:09.41]I love not doing anything.
[259:11.35]It's fun to have companions that just do everything for you.
[259:14.37]Feels great.
[259:15.35]Alright, it's right underneath us.
[259:16.41]Give me electricity.
[259:29.50]How do you get down there?
[259:44.21]Yo, stop killing him.
[259:45.47]What?
[259:50.22]I need to get in there.
[259:53.18]Oh, god damn it.
[259:54.76]Did I seriously...
[259:59.67]Flaw?
[260:01.65]Spacer's Choice found a flaw in you.
[260:05.91]During your adventures, things may happen to your character that can trigger a flaw offer.
[260:10.97]Taking the flaw is optional, but doing so provides you with a perk.
[260:16.61]Permanently crippled.
[260:18.53]Your legs have been damaged too many times, and your movement speed has now been permanently lowered.
[260:28.56]Movement speed minus 30% and you're unable to dodge.
[260:31.53]Why would I ever accept this?
[260:35.13]What?
[260:35.57]No way!
[260:36.49]Reject!
[260:41.58]Permanent 30% movement speed loss?
[260:46.98]And... No dodging ever?
[260:55.05]For one perk point.
[260:56.69]Yeah, give me five and I'll consider it.
[260:58.43]Shut up, I got it.
[260:59.89]Coming!
[261:00.11]You don't ever- you never dodge anyways.
[261:02.53]Yes, I do.
[261:36.00]Guys, I don't like this.
[261:36.60]We need to be friendly and we need to be in complete cahoots.
[261:39.94]Done.
[261:40.20]That's Sam and Mac's dialogue.
[262:05.30]But you're alright.
[262:07.08]The temperature should be dropping as we speak.
[262:09.04]Yeah, it is.
[262:09.78]I'll see to it the crew knows who kept us all from boiling alive.
[262:13.20]That's weird.
[262:13.82]If you've got time, I believe Edna has a comms issue that could use your attention.
[262:17.14]Edna?
[262:17.58]We also authorized Doc and Furu to sell you our premium meds.
[262:20.44]Ooh.
[262:23.28]Okay.
[262:24.06]Well, that's cool.
[262:28.32]Okay, we got a long tomorrow.
[262:32.77]Alright, I'm done.
[262:33.61]I did it.
[262:33.95]There's only this one.
[262:37.81]The book you retrieved for him in Emerald Vale holds the key to his enlightenment.
[262:44.99]At the Groundbreaker's security office.
[262:49.40]Groundbreaker are now friendly.
[262:52.84]So I can just walk around and just take stuff?
[262:59.98]Let's do this first.
[263:04.76]I need to repair some stuff too.
[263:06.62]Can I do that from my menu?
[263:10.63]Yeah, I can.
[263:11.43]Okay, repair.
[263:12.21]What does it cost to repair this?
[263:17.81]20 weapon parts?
[263:18.39]Are you kidding me?
[263:21.62]That's horseshit.
[263:23.92]Alright, let's get it.

[264:37.40]Plasma rifle?
[264:38.20]Sure.
[264:38.44]Okay, can I break into this door?
[264:44.25]No.
[264:44.73]Damn it.
[264:46.21]Do I have any levels up?
[264:47.03]No.
[264:47.09]Alright, let's go to that terminal.
[264:53.50]Excuse me.
[264:54.02]What was that?
[265:04.96]Impact hammer.
[265:05.86]Wait, this guy leaves the room.
[265:10.32]Steel impact hammer.
[265:12.54]No, no, no, not S-T-E-E-A.
[265:15.09]Like, actually, take it.
[265:16.15]It's not made out of steel.
[265:30.64]Okay, terminal.
[265:34.12]How do I... Where is this thing?
[265:35.22]Okay.
[265:40.09]Sealed?
[265:41.01]How do I get this door to open?
[265:42.71]Can you open this door?
[265:43.50]Uh-oh, I'm about to lose my disguise.
[265:58.11]Okay, how do I get that door open?
[266:04.71]I can't hack it.
[266:09.39]Eat food that makes you smarter.
[266:11.01]I have food that I can eat that makes me smarter?
[266:23.90]Breath inhalant?
[266:27.24]Movement speed.
[266:28.84]Companion ability cooldown.
[266:32.16]Duration... Armor rating.
[266:37.27]Mind attributes plus one.
[266:42.26]What does that mean?
[266:42.92]Mind attributes?
[266:44.11]Does that mean... Mind?
[266:46.77]Okay, just breathe in caffeine and then drink this.
[266:55.25]Critical damage.
[267:00.41]All attributes minus one.
[267:02.22]That's not good.
[267:03.08]That sucks.
[267:06.68]Personality attributes?
[267:08.98]Should I just take in a bunch of caffeine and open the door?
[267:14.71]Does this count?
[267:19.13]Hold on.
[267:21.11]Candy.
[267:23.31]Base health.
[267:26.05]Carbohydrates.
[267:28.28]Personality.
[267:31.68]Just charm the door.
[267:36.28]Alright, I'm gonna do mind attributes plus one.
[267:39.28]I'm just gonna eat one, see what happens.
[267:40.30]Okay, here we go.
[267:43.16]Fizzy tea.
[268:02.21]What?
[268:03.01]Okay, got it.
[268:03.61]Uh, eject confiscated goods.
[268:10.72]Modified pistol.
[268:12.08]Detailed a freelancer who was cagey about his business.
[268:14.78]Confiscated his personal belongings while he waited for questioning.
[268:17.14]He had a modified pistol, hatchet, metal hoop, prayer beads, locked container.
[268:22.35]He fled before we could get it down and we left his things behind so we stored them in the back of the security station.
[268:26.31]I already got those.
[268:28.09]Give me the disc.
[268:32.87]Now that we have the data cartridge, I can finally find out where that scholar I'm looking for ended up.
[268:37.76]Good.
[268:39.50]Alright.
[268:40.20]Break.
[268:40.34]Wait, I have to talk to you.
[268:44.02]Got it.
[268:44.82]His name is Reginald Chaney, and he joined a sublight salvage crew.
[268:50.31]Only he's not listed on the return manifest.
[268:53.13]Must have made landfall somewhere he wasn't supposed to.
[268:57.20]Does Sam have a companion quest?
[268:59.02]There's a domicile on Monarch in Fallbrook, rented to the same bitcart he used to buy his seat on the salvage ship.
[269:05.53]I should have guessed.
[269:07.01]What better place to lay low if you wish to avoid the authorities?
[269:10.27]Oh, you hesitated there.
[269:14.65]What aren't you telling me?
[269:16.63]Oh, it's nothing.
[269:18.57]I suppose I really didn't have much faith in actually finding him.
[269:22.45]It was a bit of a long shot, wasn't it?
[269:26.86]This is pretty convenient.
[269:28.18]Okay.
[269:28.35]Uh, let's go.
[269:59.49]Whatever I want.
[270:05.59]Let's go!

[270:14.49]Let's go tinker.
[270:17.73]Alright.
[270:19.70]I have to think about some of this right now.
[270:22.24]Breakdown.
[270:22.88]Get rid of the hatchet.
[270:26.12]Yeah, I'm not gonna use this shit.
[270:28.41]Plasma rifle.
[270:29.47]I don't think I'm gonna use it.
[270:32.89]Impact hammer.
[270:36.61]Plasma carbine.
[270:38.01]Light machine gun.
[270:39.46]I don't know if I'm gonna use any of this stuff.
[270:41.52]Get rid of the shotgun.
[270:42.42]Get rid of the hunting rifle.
[270:44.36]How many bolter pistols do I have?
[270:48.10]This one and this one?
[270:49.86]Fuck it.
[270:52.94]Keep.
[270:53.84]How many of these do I have?
[270:55.46]Two.
[270:55.56]Two.
[270:57.76]There's a Shock Cannon.
[270:58.80]Keep that one.
[270:59.42]I'm going to Tinker the stuff I currently have.
[271:10.32]I have 14,000 money right now.
[271:15.35]So, let's make this better.
[271:18.37]Tinker.

[271:40.77]I have 11,000.
[271:41.81]I have $12,000.
[271:42.09]Is this the revolver?
[271:42.79]No, no.
[271:42.91]These things kind of suck.
[271:57.44]Look at all this shit.
[271:58.58]Alright.
[271:59.50]First of all, let me just delete all my junk.
[272:02.20]No, I can't.
[272:03.66]What do I have?
[272:05.56]Modify my... No, Tinker.
[272:10.18]Okay, Helmet.

[273:08.60]Which I did most of them.
[273:09.90]There's probably one more I didn't do.

[286:06.17]I'm gonna pay it because I don't have lockpicks.
[286:31.11]Let me look at this one more time.
[286:32.05]Passage to Anywhere.
[286:33.32]In order to revive your fellow colonists stranded in hibernation, Dr. Wells needs you to travel to Stellar Bay on the terraformed moon of Monarch.
[286:44.22]Monarch is interdicted by the Halcyon Holdings Corporate Board, so you'll have to procure a nav key through unofficial channels.
[286:53.63]Monarch.
[286:58.71]Alright, can I just go?
[287:00.45]What if I don't have a key, though?
[287:21.26]Well, let's just go.
[287:21.98]How do I get back to my ship?
[287:30.66]Where's my ship?
[287:39.49]Do I just run?
[287:47.33]Find scholar.
[287:53.86]Do I have to run there?
[287:56.48]Am I a nudist?
[287:57.88]I'm a private nudist.
[288:03.18]Oh, look who it is.
[288:03.86]I just want to make sure you know that you're not coming with us.
[288:30.08]Alright.
[288:31.12]Let's see if I can just go there.
[288:34.56]Isn't he a lockpicker?
[288:35.54]Okay, so we need to go to Monarch.
[288:40.66]Warning, dangerous.
[288:41.18]What do you mean, fucking dangerous?
[288:43.27]Okay.
[288:57.90]You've acquired prayer beads.
[289:00.06]Yeah, I know.
[289:00.52]I have them.
[289:03.66]Wait!
[289:04.86]Important.
[289:17.35]Good.
[289:17.79]That's a good... That's a pretty good dentist outfit.
[289:22.63]Uh, you'll be, um... Let's do medical.
[289:26.15]Sure.
[289:30.41]Man, let's get you that.
[289:31.49]Actually, that weapon's pretty damn good.
[289:37.17]Yeah, it's a dentist doing a procedure with the thing to put over their eyes to see closer, like the magnifiers.
[289:41.52]Alright, I'm just... We're just going to go here and see what happens.
[289:45.04]Let's go.
[289:48.98]Land.
[289:49.30]Message from Dr. Wells.
[289:55.27]We'd like to congratulate you on finding a route to Monarch.
[290:01.84]Cascadia is utterly seething with dangerous, highly aggressive creatures more than capable of tearing you limb from limb.
[290:10.43]You'd have to be a lunatic to land in Cascadia, and I'm reasonably certain I tested your brain for incipient signs of insanity.
[290:18.08]Trust me.
[290:18.76]Talk to Gladys Culkelly.
[290:22.62]I'm going to fight my way over land to Stellar Bay.
[290:25.66]Tell me what you need.
[290:27.93]You'll need to speak with Hiram Blaidd.
[290:29.85]He's known as the information broker, and for good reason.
[290:32.97]If anyone knows where I can find those chemicals, it's Hiram.
[290:37.64]I need those chemicals to revive the Hope's colonists.
[290:40.94]They can help us fight back against the board.
[290:43.26]They can help us set things right.
[290:46.46]If we don't put a stop to the board, they're going to drive this colony toward a complete societal collapse.
[290:52.18]You'll see what I mean when you arrive on Monarch.
[290:55.92]Alright, you sound like you've been to Monarch.
[290:58.12]Tell me what you want me to do.
[290:58.86]You'll want to hire the services of a skilled guide.
[291:02.07]I recommend a hunter by the name of Nyoka.
[291:04.75]Frequents the drinking establishments of Stellar Bay.
[291:07.79]Very hard to miss.
[291:10.31]Once you have everything you need, make your way to Hiram Blaidd's compound.
[291:16.17]Okay.
[291:17.11]Best of luck.
[291:18.27]Everyone on the Hope is counting on you.
[291:21.00]Captain, an unusual wavelength is coming through Monarch's aetherwave frequencies.
[291:26.38]The eternal is in us all.
[291:29.54]The OSI would have you believe that your place in society, indeed in the universe, is preordained.
[291:38.37]A man who works in the mines of Hephaestus, coating his lungs in Mercury dust for not but a few bits a night.
[291:45.11]This fate is set in stone?
[291:48.47]It's a long way to say you don't have the key.
[292:11.22]Alright.
[292:12.36]Uh, that was sounding like a bunch of nonsense.
[292:14.58]Okay.
[292:14.68]Goodbye.
[292:14.86]Cool.
[292:15.22]Let's go.
[292:15.54]Alright, who's coming with?
[292:16.50]Hmm.
[292:44.57]Should we try out another dentist?
[293:04.43]Let's go!
[293:13.66]Now, why is this so dangerous?
[293:25.30]Some key, huh?
[293:26.82]You needed a key?
[293:27.82]A key?
[293:34.70]Stubborn stings.
[293:40.14]Leave them for Sam.
[293:42.12]Let's go.
[293:47.78]Ooh.
[293:50.00]Ooh.
[293:51.12]No.
[293:54.74]Alright, so I can just land here?
[293:57.92]What happens if I actually have the key?
[294:00.40]Do I get to land in a safe place, or...?
[294:02.30]I'm kind of confused how this all works.
[294:05.32]There he goes.
[294:08.49]What is he doing?
[294:19.16]Good news, customer.
[294:20.98]All germs and contaminants have been neutralized.
[294:23.80]Oh, the key lets you land in the town.
[294:27.34]Oh, well, fuck it.
[294:27.94]Who cares?
[294:28.89]We can get through this.
[294:30.13]Plus, I'll get items, too.
[294:42.31]Just don't fight anything that's too hard.
[294:57.09]That was a purple mask?
[294:57.99]Ooh.
[295:00.35]Rizzo.
[295:02.81]That's all I got out of that.
[295:03.65]1241.
[295:09.19]We can go.
[295:10.49]Hopefully there's nothing here, right?
[295:13.78]Something's attacking?
[295:17.28]I hear something.
[295:19.44]No?
[295:23.36]Just don't fight the giant monster.
[295:24.88]Just run around.
[295:34.09]That wasn't so hard.
[295:42.88]Okay, now this actually is... This actually is not good.
[295:50.12]Is there any other way to go besides the front door that I'm going?
[295:52.87]Not really.
[295:53.49]I don't think I can sneak by this.
[296:03.87]I might have to go for it.
[296:06.41]Uh-oh.
[296:06.65]Well, they're instantly dead.
[296:07.99]There's a lot more things over here.
[296:34.84]Oh my god.
[296:42.06]Okay, so that's their... Can't kill these guys.
[296:51.73]Let's go... Is there a way this way I could go?
[296:57.88]That's a dead end.
[296:58.60]I have to go back here, then.
[297:04.94]Uh-oh.
[297:13.54]No, I have to go this way.
[297:16.60]Just eat a bunch of drugs.
[297:17.68]I mean, I could go over here, but that's... I gotta wrap all the way around.
[297:21.08]No, we're going for it.
[297:22.62]Alright, let's go.
[297:26.14]Let's do it.
[297:27.16]I know we can do it.
[297:27.70]What do I got?
[297:39.62]Just do drugs.
[297:41.04]Yeah, I'm gonna do drugs.
[297:43.15]Okay, this is movement speed.
[297:46.31]So let's do... Instead of health... Let's see... Tactical time, recharge rate 50%.
[297:55.44]And then... Super... I don't know.
[297:58.94]Whatever I have.
[298:07.03]Range weapons sway.
[298:08.79]Range weapons spread.
[298:09.83]What the fuck?
[298:14.07]You can just use them from this menu?
[298:15.31]Yeah, but I want to be able to spam them.
[298:17.08]Actually, these last a minute, so that's true.
[298:21.54]That's true.
[298:21.94]Alright, um... So here we go.
[298:25.72]Let's do... Recharge rate.
[298:30.17]This lasts 25 seconds, though.
[298:33.11]Companion ability cooldown.
[298:40.21]Range weapon spread?
[298:41.10]I feel like this is not really going to do that much for me.
[298:45.44]Regen.
[298:45.92]It's just recharge rate and weapon sway.
[298:53.19]Alright, I'm going to smoke a cigarette.
[298:56.79]I'm going to inhale this.
[299:00.72]And we're going to go.
[299:13.92]Kill it.
[299:14.66]Kill one on the right.
[299:15.44]Come on.
[299:17.50]Kill it.
[299:18.00]Weak point.
[299:19.27]Hit it.
[299:47.47]Oh, I'm on fire.
[299:48.25]Am I still fucking burning?
[300:02.38]Wow, you take a lot of hits.
[300:11.01]Where are my friends?
[300:29.06]Holy shit.
[300:29.66]Alright, we're good.
[300:32.28]Come back.
[300:38.86]We can continue saving right here.
[300:42.37]Shooting a grenade launcher at wasps.
[300:46.23]Yes.
[300:47.63]Yes, I am aware.
[300:48.51]It was not ideal.
[300:50.55]Okay.
[300:57.72]Okay.
[301:00.70]Now we can stay on the road.
[301:01.97]There's one of these weirdos.
[301:03.07]Oh no, this is bad.
[301:05.55]You know what?
[301:06.63]Yeah.
[301:06.89]Yep!
[301:07.37]Yep!
[301:38.55]Holy shit.
[301:42.09]Getting burned too many times has made you susceptible to plasma.
[301:45.17]No, reject.
[301:49.21]How would you come from?
[301:58.54]I think it's time we just run.
[301:59.64]Because this is too much.
[302:02.06]Just run.
[302:02.36]Okay.
[302:19.22]It's sleeping.
[302:20.02]No, it's not.
[302:20.40]It's not anymore.
[302:21.62]Why am I trying to do this weird bunny hop thing?
[302:34.96]Alright, let's go.
[302:35.66]Almost there.
[302:39.00]Nyoka.
[302:41.34]Oops.
[302:46.25]Where am I going?
[302:47.69]Alright, I'm gonna go this way and then wrap around.
[302:50.98]Oh no, I'm running right into the nest.
[302:54.46]This is actually the nest.
[303:02.96]It's alright.
[303:03.62]We're almost there.
[303:10.07]Okay, that's big.
[303:11.39]That's big.
[303:22.81]He's level 12 and he's running away from fights.
[303:25.20]You saw how long it took me to kill one of these... Manta Queens.
[303:30.16]I'm not prepared for this.
[303:33.98]Okay, we got... Look, once I get a place of business...
[303:59.13]No!
[303:59.37]What am I doing?
[304:00.07]See?
[304:00.41]I told you.
[304:00.87]I'm trying to prove to one person that I can do it, and I can't.
[304:04.47]So, go.
[304:13.64]Dead end.
[304:14.54]Oh, no.
[304:15.26]It's right there.
[304:15.86]I just have to get there.
[304:18.02]Uh... Oh, come on.
[304:23.36]I gotta get to that bridge.
[304:33.20]Can I not just... Is this all worth 10,000?
[304:41.53]No.
[304:44.01]Wish I paid it.
[304:48.01]Oh, you've got to be out of your mind!
[304:57.47]That's so dangerous!
[304:59.93]Okay, Grandpa.
[305:01.55]And turns out... Turns out this was a really, really bad idea.
[305:05.67]Oh, fuck.
[305:11.79]Get over.
[305:12.69]Just get around, get around, get around.
[305:14.01]Almost there.

[307:59.42]These are all clues.
[308:01.26]Clues that I'm going to keep.
[308:03.52]This is evidence.
[308:07.60]Ooh, I found one not yet.
[308:14.97]Anything else I can take?
[308:18.55]Oh, several ragged outfits, all the same cut and color, were stuffed into this suitcase.
[308:22.75]Hmm, interesting.
[308:26.45]We have a bed.
[308:28.61]We have a note on the table.
[308:31.12]This bedding slip lists some incredibly bold wagers made for a team called Mostly Colonists.
[308:36.48]It's from Leftfield Tossball Bedding.
[308:38.54]Hmm.
[308:45.60]Investigate left field, toss ball, betting.
[308:48.44]Find out what happened here.
[308:52.17]I will probably avenge you.
[308:53.59]Unless I get sidetracked.
[308:57.89]Which then I just won't.
[308:59.27]Who lives in here?
[308:59.77]There's an Inferno side in here.

[311:16.88]Don't you recognize me?
[311:19.14]I'd heard they'd gotten a new hacker.

[312:34.47]I don't know for sure, but I saw Elijah and his buddies pushing Isaac around.
[312:38.67]What do your teeth look like?
[312:39.74]They're hooligans from Fallbrook.
[312:41.66]They sweep into town, drop supplies off behind the warehouse, and spend the rest of their stay getting rowdy over tossball games.
[312:49.16]They usually loiter in the alley behind the Yacht Club.
[312:51.80]They're not allowed in the bar anymore.
[312:53.81]I bet you anything Isaac ran into trouble with one of them.
[312:57.63]Okay, thanks for the tip.
[312:59.12]Appreciate it.
[312:59.42]I'm fucking just utterly revolted right now.

[313:56.30]Anything else?
[313:57.92]No?
[313:58.24]That got awkward.
[314:04.28]I just threw four dolls in the trash.
[314:07.19]What's wrong with you?
[314:07.91]That's weird.
[314:08.49]Lot machine?
[314:15.65]No.
[314:19.01]Is it behind this?
[314:25.90]Alright, here we go.
[314:28.84]I gotta be careful.
[314:31.08]Please, will someone help me?
[314:33.00]My boy is in trouble.
[314:35.02]Oh, thank you for stopping.
[314:38.22]Everyone acts like nothing's wrong.
[314:40.30]Like my little boy isn't at risk of being eaten by some vile creature.
[314:45.05]Please, you have to help me get my little Tucker back.
[314:47.99]He ran away and is going to get himself killed.
[314:51.19]Oh, I just know a raptodon is melting him with acid as we speak.
[314:58.34]Okay, your child is missing.
[314:59.64]Where'd you last see him?
[315:00.76]Oh, I just knew you were a good person.
[315:03.30]Agnes, I said, this is the man to save your little Tucky.
[315:06.72]And I was right.
[315:08.60]He ran out into the wilderness a few days ago.
[315:11.00]He's dead.
[315:11.36]I warned him about the raptodon.
[315:14.62]There's no way he's higher than me in level.
[315:18.54]I have rocket launchers and sniper rifles.
[315:21.16]He's picking flowers out there.
[315:24.39]He's absolutely dead.
[315:25.77]It's a reward.
[315:39.00]I'll give you every last one if you just bring my Tucker back to me.
[315:44.04]I won't even be mad at him running off.
[315:46.22]You tell him I won't be mad.
[315:50.44]I'll help you find your son.
[315:52.14]Oh, I know he'll be safe now that someone's able to fetch him home.
[315:56.29]You look for him in Amber Heights, you hear?
[315:58.07]It's down the road southwest of town.
[316:00.79]I'm sure he made it that far.
[316:02.71]I just know it.
[316:04.90]Okay.
[316:05.16]But first.
[316:05.70]Where is this person?

[317:32.27]Okay.
[317:38.36]shit talk me that's what happens okay we got what we needed shoot the barrel I did alright we got her let's go we have to go to uh sand jar
[318:05.68]Whose bright idea was it to equip a janitorial auto-mech with a flamethrower?
[318:10.68]Warning!
[318:11.69]Modifying this unit will void the warranty.
[318:17.57]I'm here.
[318:18.01]For the debt.
[318:19.35]Could I make another advance, Mr. Nandi?
[318:22.65]Just make sure it's properly logged.
[318:26.22]Well, new business turns up at last.
[318:30.68]It's not that much.
[318:31.66]I gotta say,
[319:02.41]great teeth uh but you have a meeting with me did you hear that power play celia we don't make them like this anymore in halcyon I only hope you don't judge me by my handshake now what business brings you here
[319:24.53]Me, I'm trying my own path.
[319:25.95]Going where the wind takes me.
[319:28.07]I'm just looking for the information broker.
[319:29.43]That's all I care about.
[319:30.19]Hey, it could always be both.
[319:31.83]If I have to eat one more weird science project passed off as food in this sprat-fucked colony, I'm gonna stab someone.
[319:55.83]It could be both.
[319:56.55]If you're free of the other corporations, why would you want to bring them back?
[320:19.68]Hmm.
[320:45.17]And you're tired of scrounging and scraping by.
[320:47.03]Is that it?
[320:47.45]So now we're in, right?
[320:48.47]So we're gonna, we're in.
[320:49.37]So what do you want to do?
[321:12.77]Well, Mr. Nandi here has a rather ingenious plan to get MSI restored to the board.
[321:18.67]On our terms, mind you.
[321:20.85]Returning to the board is your only chance if you hope to survive here on Monarch.
[321:25.03]That doesn't mean it'll be easily achievable.
[321:28.25]Indeed not.
[321:29.59]No worthwhile plan was ever simple.
[321:32.16]That's what I always say.
[321:34.26]And if our advertising scheme hasn't borne fruit, then perhaps it's time we took matters into our own hands.
[321:42.08]This lady knows what's up.
[321:44.16]It's true.
[321:44.74]Our Celia is an alarmingly competent middle manager.
[321:48.14]At any other company, she'd be wasted in data entry.
[321:51.75]The plan she refers to is a two-pronged approach.
[321:54.39]Dentist only.
[322:01.37]We have to have other things besides dentist references to every piece of dialogue.
[322:05.73]I've gotta come up with other things to say.
[322:11.11]With a Bolt 52 cartridge, of course.
[322:13.77]If you can get us what we need to rejoin the board, starting the Bolt 52, we'll be able to become one of the most productive and secure cities in Halcyon.
[322:22.96]And you'll have a powerful ally on the board.
[322:24.98]Farmers only?
[322:28.18]What is that?
[322:29.56]Wait, is that...
[322:35.17]Why does this bolt sound so useful?
[322:37.17]That's the farmer dating website.
[322:39.06]Alright, where do I get a bolt?
[322:40.38]Oh, why are you saying it like that?
[323:04.51]Arms?
[323:04.75]You're saying arms instead of arms.
[323:06.65]That's just what it's called.
[323:08.05]It's supposed to stand for something, but I forget what.
[323:12.13]Why am I such a weirdo?
[323:13.53]Why do I care about some of these things?
[323:22.60]I'll see what I can do.
[323:23.30]Good enough.
[323:24.26]I know when to settle.
[323:26.38]oh and while you're at it there should be a terminal in the arms building with some dangerous information perhaps you could delete it so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands you want me to wipe your hard drive alright what do we got I want to wait family man okay here we go I still need to do this
[323:55.61]A fine day for business, isn't it?
[323:58.23]Anyway, what can I do for you?
[324:01.33]Isaac Rose is dead.
[324:02.80]I found the people who killed him.
[324:04.42]But that's terrible.
[324:06.72]What happened?
[324:08.42]I've taken care of it.
[324:09.64]The killer's dead.
[324:10.78]But that means we won't be able to log their testimonies.
[324:13.76]Is there a problem?
[324:15.08]If there's one thing I've been hoping to reestablish in Stellar Bay, it's proper documentation for legal matters.
[324:23.93]Uh, sometimes you gotta take matters into your own hands.
[324:25.65]Maybe I could have gotten their statements if they hadn't been ready to kill me.
[324:28.26]Okay, goodbye.
[324:48.07]Now, let me take a look.
[324:53.99]40 is tinkering cost minus 50%.
[324:56.97]That's pretty amazing.
[325:07.67]These guys seem a lot less evil.
[325:09.15]I don't know about that.
[325:11.35]Maybe.
[325:19.98]No weapon sway for five seconds after each kill.
[325:22.02]That's pretty good.
[325:23.76]Ah, what should I do, though?
[325:24.82]I think I'm just gonna put it into... Medical.
[325:39.39]Yeah.
[325:41.89]But... Here's the thing about lying.
[325:45.35]I have 70 lie right now.
[325:48.14]nothing that I've done in the game so far has required more than 40 or 50. yeah this is dentistry there we go 40 breakdown weapons and armor for a 20 chance to attract a basic mod yeah let's just we'll get that up to 40.
[326:16.64]I will get to 100 live eventually.
[326:18.65]Don't worry.
[326:22.77]I'm gonna stack it for the end game.
[326:24.55]Well, I will.
[326:25.85]Don't worry.
[326:26.21]We'll get it.
[326:29.25]So.
[326:30.22]There's something else I need to do.
[326:31.58]Family matter.
[326:33.28]Look for Tucker.
[326:34.24]Right.
[326:34.40]I'm gonna do that and then radio free.
[326:37.98]Oh, shit.
[326:38.40]We're still on.
[326:39.90]Faction quest.
[326:40.62]We haven't even done the main thing yet.
[326:45.63]Where's this kid?
[326:47.81]Alright, we're gonna go find this kid.
[326:52.33]So, here's the deal.
[326:52.97]I'll tell you.
[326:53.46]You ready for the deal?
[327:16.12]We're going to play this tomorrow.
[327:19.00]Not done yet.
[327:19.62]But we're going to play this tomorrow.
[327:23.96]And at the end of tomorrow's stream, we're going to see if this is something that I'm going to continue playing on stream.
[327:32.81]Tomorrow is Thanksgiving, that's correct.
[327:37.51]Alright, hold on.
[327:39.29]368.
[327:39.43]Do I have any fast travels?
[327:41.93]No.
[327:48.33]So, because it's Thanksgiving tomorrow, I probably am gonna start streaming a little bit later than usual.
[328:05.34]So, tomorrow will probably be a later stream, instead of starting at like 1 or 2.
[328:13.21]We'll probably start... Not that much later, but just late enough where if everyone had things to do... It'll be a later night stream.
[328:26.36]Probably around like 4.
[328:30.11]PM.
[328:30.71]Pacific.
[328:32.99]Then it'll be about 7 Eastern.
[328:36.55]We can just chill.
[328:42.40]Because it is fun just to kind of play a game, even though I'm playing it strangely.
[328:50.10]I'm still enjoying it.
[328:51.60]At least for now.
[328:55.81]Now here's the real question.
[328:58.03]Am I going to die by attacking these hooligans?
[329:04.15]Nope, I won't even need to attack them.
[329:05.73]Because I can just run this way.
[329:16.24]Stream title?
[329:16.94]Oh, you've got to believe the stream title tomorrow is going to be... I don't know, like the Wizard of Oz Dentists Edition?
[329:25.70]Or the Wizard of Oz Director's Cut Dentists.
[329:27.98]I don't know, something like that.
[329:31.16]Something about dentists.
[329:41.26]The Dentists of Oz.
[329:44.28]They could use a little work.
[329:45.28]I'll put some work into it.
[329:52.39]Or it could just be in all capitals.
[329:54.41]Dentists.
[329:55.11]Period.
[329:55.87]Only.
[329:56.37]Period.
[329:57.31]That's not bad.
[330:05.46]He laughed at his own joke.
[330:08.08]Because it was fucking good.
[330:18.09]Amber Heights, let's go!
[330:20.51]Repeat the joke.
[330:21.59]It was too good to repeat.
[330:23.17]It was... hysterical.
[330:26.07]Tucker!
[330:26.43]Try it!
[330:28.37]I fucking dare you!
[330:29.73]Oh, don't say that!
[330:30.77]Don't tell me that!
[330:31.63]Don't do that!
[330:33.31]That's a bad move.
[330:35.15]That's a bad move.
[330:36.65]I'm telling you.
[330:37.87]Well, I'll tell you something right now.
[330:39.49]It ain't gonna be me.
[330:40.75]It's gonna be my boy Max!
[330:48.05]He missed!
[330:48.99]A rare miss!
[331:05.07]He's getting tired.
[331:06.05]He's getting tired.
[331:10.29]Where's Tucker?
[331:18.32]Wow, what a bullshit personality this is.
[331:20.52]Fake.
[331:20.64]I fucking dare you.
[331:21.71]Oh, I'm so sorry!
[331:22.21]Yeah, bullshit.
[331:22.63]I already- I smelt the spoiler in this area.
[331:48.58]I don't want a pamphlet.
[331:49.26]Just get the fuck out of my way.
[331:51.76]Yeah, right.
[331:54.30]Where's the kid?
[331:58.94]No corporation means no paycheck.
[332:00.37]How do you survive without money?
[332:01.57]No problems?
[332:02.41]What about raptadons?
[332:04.53]Oh, those are just hurdles.
[332:06.23]We deal with them as they come.
[332:08.33]You're welcome to stay with us, so long as you can earn your keep.
[332:11.13]Hmm, okay.
[332:12.55]Oh, one big happy family.
[332:14.17]Uh, got it.
[332:14.59]Hey, before I go, I'm looking for a Tucker.
[332:17.11]Have you seen him?
[332:18.07]The new boy!
[332:18.99]Yes, he's quite clever.
[332:20.61]He took to our teachings very quickly.
[332:23.31]Last I saw him, he was headed into one of the buildings up the hill.
[332:28.99]You don't get away from me.
[332:31.41]Yep.
[332:32.21]Let's get the kid and let's get the hell out of here.
[332:58.40]Tucker.
[333:02.02]Time to come home.
[333:02.56]It's like I'm not the only new face around here.
[333:04.84]What do I call you, stranger?
[333:05.88]I don't know why I thought you were going to be, like, six.
[333:11.10]That's just my... Oh, come on.
[333:12.96]We like to be friendly around here.
[333:15.22]At the least, let me call you Captain.
[333:17.40]Whether or not you command a ship, if you've found your way here, you must be a leader type.
[333:22.92]So then, Captain, welcome to Amber Heights.
[333:26.15]Oh, and call me Tucker.
[333:30.64]Uh, Tucker.
[333:37.32]You're a new face too, huh?
[333:39.03]Free from what?
[333:40.43]You're the little boy!
[333:41.35]I am not a little boy.
[333:44.95]Haven't been one for decades.
[333:47.23]No matter what my mama wishes.
[333:49.83]I take it she's still looking for me?
[333:52.37]I'd hope she'd accept my decision.
[333:55.51]She made it seem like you were in danger.
[333:57.75]She's offered a reward to anyone who brings you back.
[334:00.97]She said that you were in danger.
[334:01.83]According to her, stepping foot outside of the house in broad daylight is too dangerous.
[334:06.92]My entire life, she crammed a fear of danger down my throat.
[334:11.12]Shit.
[334:12.16]Don't go play with friends.
[334:13.70]Bantosaurs will tear your arms off.
[334:15.66]Overprotective mother or cult.
[334:16.98]That's tough.
[334:17.82]Marauders can violate you.
[334:23.70]You'd fall in a sulfur pool.
[334:26.67]I stuck around way too long, ruled by her fears.
[334:31.13]I'm 42 years old, but she still sees me as a little boy in need of her protection.
[334:36.55]I won't stand for it, I tell you.
[334:42.78]I'm getting that reward either you go back or I'll beat it out of her.
[334:47.66]Oh my god.
[334:50.44]Whoa.
[335:10.88]She's gonna keep sending people to look for you you're going back to Stella Bay one way or another I'm getting that reward
[335:21.71]A dent?
[335:22.29]Would a dent?
[335:22.83]Okay, what's the... the oath that all dentists have to take?
[335:28.66]What's that oath?
[335:30.12]Dentist Oath.
[335:33.24]The Hippocratic Oath.
[335:37.55]Do dentists take the Hippocratic Oath?
[335:39.79]Hold on, this is important.
[335:44.92]It's a code of doctors for do the right thing, a moral code of ethical conduct and practice in medicine.
[335:49.20]At medical school graduations, doctors swear this oath to leave them with more reminders to where their professional focus lies.
[335:56.43]Do dentists take the Hippocratic Oath?
[335:58.19]And if not, should they have to?
[336:01.27]Okay.
[336:06.74]So...
[336:09.49]Do they take it?
[336:11.27]It doesn't say.
[336:12.63]Although mainly used by doctors, the Hippocratic Oath is often translated to a dentist's context.
[336:18.45]Okay.
[336:21.77]So they do.
[336:28.98]No, they don't.
[336:29.76]Well, they can.
[336:31.22]They use the word patient.
[336:32.60]They use a different one.
[336:37.23]What in the nebula is wrong with you?
[336:39.69]She's an old woman.
[336:41.50]You'd threaten my flesh and blood just to get me to do what you want?
[336:44.94]Holy shit.
[336:57.28]Shrug.
[337:00.44]I was just kidding.
[337:01.62]I was kidding.
[337:02.78]That was not even close to funny.
[337:05.17]I was kidding.
[337:08.11]You give me that fucking reward.
[337:09.25]Yeah, you... Hey, I'm just fucking around.
[337:10.53]I'm kidding.
[337:10.83]Don't worry.
[337:27.46]But you're going back one way or another.
[337:29.44]No, that is not gonna happen.
[337:31.50]I spent too many years there smothered by my mama's fears.
[337:35.30]Now that I'm free, nothing can change my mind.
[337:42.20]There's really nothing that I could convince you to go home?
[337:45.32]Stellar Bay is not my home.
[337:47.78]Not anymore.
[337:49.22]I finally found the space to breathe.
[337:52.14]And that's here in Amber Heights.
[337:57.13]You better go fucking back.
[337:59.97]What in the nebula is wrong with you?
[338:02.46]She's an old woman.
[338:04.24]You'd threaten my flesh and blood just to get me to do what you want?
[338:11.04]You're real sick.
[338:13.41]Sure, she drives me crazy, but she doesn't deserve anyone getting violent with her.
[338:18.59]Look, I'll go back, alright?
[338:21.05]Just don't hurt her.
[338:32.92]It was just a joke.
[338:34.60]I was kidding.
[338:35.46]You don't have to leave.
[338:40.68]You didn't wait for the punchline.
[338:42.68]There's a punchline.
[338:53.11]I didn't wait for the punchline, guys.
[338:57.27]Excellent dental work.
[338:58.67]Thank you.
[339:06.78]OK, return to Stellar Bay.
[339:08.34]Alright, let's go back to Stellar Bay.
[339:15.22]Can I fast travel?
[339:24.12]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[339:25.50]Wait.
[339:25.66]Commodentist.
[339:35.49]I'll tell you there's one thing that I do miss from the Fallout games and I know I know
[340:02.13]But listen, it was, listen to me.
[340:07.86]It just, I would like to see them move around outside their towns.
[340:17.66]When he opens that door, I wish I could just, he opened the door and he could be walking like they did in the Redacted games.
[340:39.36]Alright, hold on.
[340:39.84]Wait, wait.
[340:40.22]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[340:43.08]Now fast travel.
[340:46.20]Okay, go back here then.
[341:04.65]Alright.
[341:06.17]What's the reward?
[341:18.24]There we are.
[341:18.96]Hi, Tucker.
[341:26.91]Captain.
[341:28.73]Captain.
[341:30.41]Oh, Captain, you did it.
[341:32.51]My little boy is back safe and sound.
[341:36.14]Tell the captain how grateful we are, Tuck Tuck.
[341:40.51]Lie one.
[341:41.01]Only one point to lie like this.
[342:08.74]You mentioned a reward?
[342:10.00]Very gullible.
[342:11.22]You've ruined this guy's life.
[342:14.12]Now that I have the money, you can go, Tucker.
[342:36.75]No, I don't mean it.
[342:37.57]I'm just kidding.
[342:38.03]What, are you stupid?
[342:39.19]You believe me by this point?
[342:39.83]How many things have I told you that were bullshit?
[342:41.25]What, are you dumb?
[343:01.10]What, are you an idiot?
[343:02.04]By the way, Tucker.
[343:30.72]Yes, Mama.
[343:32.44]That was the punchline that you walked away from.
[343:36.16]Nothing can ever hurt you here in Stellar Bay.
[343:39.40]Not with Mama on duty.
[343:43.78]Only you'd listened.
[343:44.50]Here we go!
[344:01.02]I can't.
[344:01.48]I can't.
[344:02.48]Wait, how do I holster?
[344:32.32]He's still hostile.
[344:38.24]Everything's back to the way it should be.
[344:40.50]Welcome.
[344:41.06]Thank you for bringing my little boy home.
[344:51.33]I've had quite enough of you.
[345:03.11]Max, what the fuck?
[345:06.94]It was over.
[345:08.10]You didn't have to do that.
[345:09.86]Always speak to me first before you do anything like that.
[345:19.85]Come on.
[345:20.45]Protocol.
[345:23.19]You're going against the Hippodentist Oath.
[345:42.70]Okay.
[345:44.86]Let's go.
[345:45.28]What?
[345:45.46]Okay.
[345:45.71]We need- I need to know.
[345:46.49]I have to know.
[345:47.73]I have to know.
[345:48.39]Just wait.
[346:10.76]Sometimes violence is the only way.
[346:24.39]Oh no, you hit him.
[346:29.29]Putting trash in its rightful place for more than 70 years.
[346:33.55]Thank you for bringing my little boy home.
[346:41.78]Everything's back to the way it should be.
[346:44.58]Thank you for bringing my little boy home.
[346:48.43]What?
[346:49.25]He's dead.
[347:00.98]What?
[347:01.36]This doesn't make any... Okay.
[347:16.98]He's not gonna be there for the rest of the playthrough, is he?
[347:27.42]If he's there for the rest of the whole playthrough, this is fucking ridiculous.
[347:34.75]She's just looking at him.
[347:38.01]Alright, this is fucking freaking me out.
[347:40.33]We gotta get out of here.
[347:48.43]Do people know?
[347:48.97]Do people know?
[347:50.55]Oh, I have to talk to you.
[347:57.97]Goomba stomp from Sam.
[348:01.68]I'm just going to keep listening.
[348:17.78]I'm Junko, certified dentist.
[348:19.00]Pleased to meet you.
[348:19.54]Who are you?
[348:45.96]Name's Neoka.
[348:47.28]I'm the best big game hunter on the planet.
[348:50.48]You're also the loudest big game hunter on the planet.
[348:52.26]Okay, for a second I thought that was Max.
[348:53.70]I was like, did we put disguises on now because we killed that guy?
[348:59.04]Fair point.
[349:00.15]I deserve it though.
[349:02.19]On account of being the best.
[349:07.17]Well, I'm Junko.
[349:08.47]Are you always this drunk?
[349:09.87]You think this is drunk?
[349:11.59]I gotta... You need to get out more.
[349:15.88]Sit.
[349:16.38]Partake.
[349:17.46]Buy me a drink and let's chat.
[349:21.57]Sure.
[349:21.85]Another round, bartender.
[349:24.27]I'm told you can get me to an information broker.
[349:27.11]Another round.
[349:28.25]Outstanding.
[349:32.11]What are you doing in Stellar Bay, stranger?
[349:36.18]I'm on vacation.
[349:37.82]Oof.
[349:39.04]Some hell you've chosen.
[349:40.90]You must really love fish.
[349:45.89]Uh, allergic, actually.
[349:48.07]That is a fucking shame.
[349:53.85]Uh, listen, I heard you can help me find an information broker that's... Well, well, well, well.
[350:00.84]Remember that- Remember the time you murdered a woman's son in front of her?
[350:05.78]I didn't do anything.
[350:09.33]It was two rogue dentists.
[350:22.13]I mean, I may have been there.
[350:23.27]I tried to stop.
[350:24.05]I said, hey.
[350:25.50]A robot fell on his head after he was shot with a shotgun two times.
[350:30.04]But I didn't do it.
[350:30.78]Max did.
[350:31.52]Max is the rogue dentistry.
[350:39.28]Alright, alright.
[350:40.48]I'm headed back there after I sober up.
[350:41.82]You want a guide?
[350:45.55]Uh, what do you need?
[350:47.34]Outstanding.
[350:49.42]Our dispensary here maintains a stock of, uh, well, I don't rightly know what they are.
[350:55.28]Steroid or caffeine somethings?
[350:58.04]Pills.
[350:59.02]They're very good.
[351:01.94]I'm cut off for the month on account of needing one just about every damn day.
[351:06.12]But I'm sure you've got your wily ways.
[351:08.98]Fetch me one and we'll be all set.
[351:12.87]Uh... You mean... Caffeinoid?
[351:16.07]That stuff's a stimulant.
[351:19.97]Yeah, good, good answer!
[351:20.88]Good answer!
[351:21.46]Good answer!
[351:22.02]The two of them behind me.
[351:23.58]Well, they work.
[351:25.46]We got a deal or what?
[351:27.38]You won't find a better deal in Halcyon than our special one-time offer for a refurbished sanitation unit.
[351:34.81]Remember, if it's dirty, it's a job for Sam.
[351:38.95]Uh-oh, why did we drop in frames?
[351:40.03]Uh-oh.
[351:40.25]You think talks?
[351:44.05]Uh, that's Sam.
[351:46.31]He, uh, she, it helps me stay clean.
[351:49.23]Anyway, I'll go get those meds.
[351:50.99]Of course it does.
[351:52.31]Bye.
[351:52.87]Okay, we need medicine.
[352:08.95]What's this?
[352:11.61]in the eyes it was three or four of them took down with one shot buy me a drink okay nobody tell him what about that the stream was he doesn't know I know about the internet
[352:41.81]I have a thing over here that monitors how many frames I drop.
[352:47.62]I see it.
[352:48.02]Let's go get something to sober you up.
[352:50.36]Caffeine.
[352:50.74]I would like some caffeine.
[353:05.94]Been asked to pick up some, uh, cafenoid supplements.
[353:08.72]As a fellow dentist, you should know what that is.
[353:11.10]Uh, they're for me.
[353:23.98]I'm so sorry but with the iconoclasts and the marauder filth chasing away what little trade we get I'm afraid I have to reserve my supply for stellar bay residents our reserves have gotten so low I've even had to start locking the supply room upstairs isn't it a shame what some people will do to get a little extra uh you just can't trust people these days
[353:51.95]except for you and I can tell you've got one of those faces fellow dentists guilty as charged an exception for you if I could my little cherub is there anyone else needing a special pickup from auntie Abigail well now that you say that um I don't know auntie you'll have to pry that secret from my sweet little cheeks orange you a saucy thing
[354:21.69]uh-huh why don't you show me a thing or two experience I guess you've worked here a long time are we about to
[354:47.21]It's...
[355:07.43]Oh, her.
[355:08.79]Did I pick wrong?
[355:09.47]It's none of my business.
[355:10.83]But I had told her Dr. Williams would bump up her monthly allotment if only she'd join MSI.
[355:16.50]Contribute like the rest of us.
[355:18.62]I'm just going to go break into the room upstairs anyways.
[355:21.36]And you know me, dear.
[355:22.14]I'm going to kick the door down and just go grab it and leave.
[355:29.06]Doesn't anyone else have this?
[355:30.92]If so, I would love to know where.
[355:33.38]Sublight supplies don't come cheap.
[355:36.78]Believe me, there's nothing I'd love better than to help you.
[355:40.96]But there's not much I can do.
[355:43.92]Dr. Williams managed the town's allotments from his terminal upstairs.
[355:48.29]Even I can't access them.
[355:49.41]I've got a hacker dentist with me.
[355:51.13]We sure can.
[355:52.95]Enough sweet talk.
[355:53.95]Get me caffeine or you're going to need a taste of your own medicine.
[355:57.03]What?
[355:58.30]I thought you were in charge around here, Auntie.
[355:59.90]You sure ought to be.
[356:04.08]You should be in charge here.
[356:09.83]I'm not gonna threaten every old lady.
[356:13.65]I didn't even threaten an old lady.
[356:15.31]I threatened an old lady's son.
[356:18.12]And then he died.
[356:19.60]Mysteriously.
[356:20.84]From a robotic dentist.
[356:26.84]Okay, alright.
[356:28.52]What's the supply room?
[356:30.73]Oh.
[356:30.87]Okay.
[356:31.03]Okay.
[356:40.43]Thank you.
[356:51.05]Well, I can get into these rooms.
[356:55.30]Thank you, Granny.
[356:57.34]Appreciate all the stuff.
[356:59.86]Oh, you got a balcony view, too.
[357:01.44]Nice.
[357:01.74]This is probably a pretty hefty lease.
[357:20.52]Caffeinoid.
[357:24.03]Caffeinoid.
[357:27.97]Okay.
[357:30.71]Well, our work here is done.
[357:31.81]Oh.
[357:38.97]Patient records.
[357:40.00]Data storage.
[357:42.76]Uh, somebody can read this.
[357:50.36]23,000 words.
[357:50.60]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[357:54.40]Hold on a second.
[357:54.93]This is like a stellar bride.
[358:02.29]Is this Grandma's fan fiction?
[358:09.77]You've been ever so kind to me.
[358:11.43]Let's just skip to the end.
[358:13.91]He shook his head as if he'd read her mind with his perfect green eyes.
[358:16.59]Gale, the Earth whispered, letting her breath warm his ear.
[358:20.45]I can certainly find a position for you here.
[358:22.47]Oh, laws.
[358:24.13]She pressed a finger to his lips.
[358:25.65]Only the laws love.
[358:29.47]Patient record.
[358:30.31]Dumb.
[358:31.55]What?
[358:32.90]Patient not found.
[358:33.84]Please try again.
[358:38.84]Oh, misspelling the name.
[358:45.03]Create new account.
[358:46.14]Alright, let's go.
[358:57.41]Hey, Grandma.
[358:58.17]Thank you for everything.
[359:00.53]Come to share a secret with Auntie Abigail?
[359:04.73]Come to share a secret with Auntie Abigail?
[359:09.98]The secret is...
[359:22.68]Sup?
[359:24.74]Sup?
[359:27.09]You're back.
[359:29.03]Good news?
[359:30.27]Bad news?
[359:31.53]Good news.
[359:32.37]All of the above?
[359:35.91]I've got your magic pills.
[359:37.18]These things are dangerous, don't you know?
[359:38.62]More or less dangerous than a steady supply of alcohol.
[359:42.40]Give it here.
[359:47.44]Whew, that hits the spot.
[359:49.46]Right in the, oh, no, there it is.
[359:52.20]There it is.
[359:53.52]Yes.
[359:54.69]We're in business.
[359:56.41]Let's go.
[359:56.93]That's scary.
[360:00.05]Glad to have you.
[360:00.97]Great.
[360:01.63]Where to?
[360:03.57]Let's find that information broker.
[360:05.47]Oh, Hiram?
[360:06.81]I ain't checked in on that man in an age.
[360:09.25]He's running the giant radio tower we lovingly call Devil's Peak.
[360:13.80]We'll be going south and west, mostly along the road till we're past Fallbrook.
[360:18.80]Out there, there's a western slope that'll lead us through some, uh, some fun.
[360:23.09]Okay.
[360:23.41]You like hunting, right?
[360:24.83]That's fun.
[360:25.35]If you're more of a spelunker, rotting river will take you into the mountain caverns.
[360:31.19]We can discuss options when we get closer.
[360:32.87]Okay, what size, uh, dentist Halloween costume are you?
[360:37.07]I don't mind waiting somewhere until you got a spot open.
[360:42.02]Let me tell you.
[360:45.03]I got a ship at that docking bay.
[360:46.47]Ah.
[361:10.58]Do you want to go too?
[361:12.62]I kind of feel like that was like a thing between us and it sounded really fun and cool and shit.
[361:18.00]And you were just listening.
[361:19.10]Do you like want to go?
[361:20.66]I feel bad.
[361:22.60]Oh, well, I'll come back and like hang out later.
[361:32.65]I know that sucks.
[361:33.99]Uh, bye.
[361:34.93]Sorry.
[361:41.21]Now let me roleplay.
[361:42.11]Well, I know, thank you.
[361:43.37]Sir, that sounds like a lot of fun.
[361:46.85]But I've got to tend to this bar here.
[361:49.23]Okay, sir.
[361:50.37]Have a great day.
[361:51.62]You too, now.
[361:54.52]Now I don't feel bad.
[361:56.32]Who was it?
[361:56.60]Who were you?
[361:58.00]Oh, it's you.
[361:58.50]Uh... Leave me alone.
[362:08.66]Okay, we're fine.
[362:12.85]I'm pretty much at a spot here.
[362:15.11]The broker resides in a station at the top of Devil's Peak.
[362:17.91]Travel there and speak with him.
[362:28.23]What the fuck just happened?
[362:31.00]What the fuck?
[362:32.78]That's enormous.
[362:35.32]That's a... What did you just do?
[362:42.93]50,000 bits.
[362:44.05]That's more bits than I currently have in the video game.
[362:49.21]And this is a video game.
[362:51.74]That's $500 in bits that PhylacteryLitch just gave.
[362:55.50]Holy shit.
[363:04.31]Still, still just dropping mad money.
[363:12.43]Um... That's a lot.
[363:17.10]Thank you.
[363:17.98]They say, Happy Thanksgiving and early Christmas, Jerma.
[363:20.16]Thanks for another year of being the highest low IQ streamer.
[363:23.02]It's true.
[363:26.70]Uh... Thanks for the ridiculous amount of money.
[363:32.80]500 bucks in bits.
[363:38.34]Which, that's a huge amount of money that you actually spent.
[363:41.44]I really appreciate it.
[363:45.42]That's completely unnecessary.
[363:47.76]But thank you for the fucking ridiculous amount of money.
[363:50.66]And that's thousands and thousands of dollars that you've given.
[363:59.08]Like, an absolute shitload.
[364:05.02]Next time he wants it in cash.
[364:07.86]Alright, is it time for the lie?
[364:09.06]Is it lie time?
[364:09.80]Alright, 80 lie.
[364:24.79]But seriously, Final Act 3, you've been a monumental contributor to the stream.
[364:31.93]It's kind of hard to find words.
[364:37.53]Thank you.
[364:41.29]Science?
[364:41.71]Did I do science weapon damage?
[364:42.97]What is science weapon?
[364:48.16]Does that include plasma?
[364:50.18]That's not just bullets, right?
[364:58.17]Movement penalty to accuracy.
[364:59.33]That's kind of a big deal.
[365:00.47]What about some of the other ones up here?
[365:06.06]I think I'm going to do the signs weapon damage.
[365:10.98]I don't have it yet.
[365:11.66]Oh, never mind.
[365:14.04]Alright, this one here.
[365:15.94]While in tactical time dilation, you deal increased weak spot damage.
[365:19.78]Yeah, that's the one.
[365:25.40]How far away is this one?
[365:27.18]Actually kind of in a shitty spot, isn't it?
[365:41.24]Science weapons are science weapons, you'll know.
[365:43.76]Okay.
[365:45.88]Let's turn over here.
[365:47.24]And 500.
[365:47.58]Yeah, don't worry.
[365:52.18]When I go back to the ship, they'll be... She'll be in dentist garb when I go back.
[365:57.89]Don't worry.
[365:58.17]Alright, slow down.
[366:01.85]I don't want to die here.
[366:13.77]Alright, this is going to be bad.
[366:19.31]Shoot it in the... Oh my god, he's running!
[366:25.78]Thank you.
[366:26.20]You've had plenty of practice to do that move.
[366:42.36]The broker.
[366:43.04]Oh, I can't go this way.
[366:45.64]This is a really shitty place to be.
[366:48.12]Can I go?
[366:48.42]I have to go back around here.
[366:54.03]I hear them, but I'm not... I knew I heard it.
[366:58.83]How?
[366:58.99]They're everywhere.
[366:59.83]Why are they just everywhere?
[367:00.69]Oh, fuck.
[367:05.03]Slow down.
[367:05.63]Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.
[367:21.63]Good shot.
[367:25.07]Stop using the plasma.
[367:31.74]It's not effective.
[367:33.96]It's the best weapon I have, though.
[367:35.14]It does more damage than anything else I have against everything.
[367:37.12]Until I get something better, it's gonna have to stick.
[367:45.91]Alright, I can go up left.
[367:49.46]I hope I can go through here.
[367:53.74]What?
[367:53.84]Scientist.
[367:54.14]Hello?
[367:54.42]Did I not react in time?
[368:21.80]I could have saved him?
[368:22.86]Oh well.
[368:24.90]Too bad.
[368:34.83]Can't save everybody.
[368:37.91]That is the tagline.
[368:38.67]Okay, so I need to go around and then it looks like there's a door or something I can go through.
[368:45.56]Hopefully this opens.
[368:56.83]Unsealed the door.
[368:59.03]That was easy.
[368:59.53]That was incredibly easy.
[369:02.93]Thought it was going to be much harder than that.
[369:04.51]Okay.
[369:12.16]Okay.
[369:24.74]Who's left?
[369:27.82]Shit, come on.
[369:38.54]That guy has a fucking flamethrower.
[369:46.00]What the fuck?
[369:52.67]Well...
[369:54.87]It's not as easy as I thought this was going to be.
[369:56.51]Maybe I can just sneak by this.
[370:05.99]I'm going to go for it.
[370:30.62]I'm not fucking wrong.
[370:34.90]Alright, that fucking axe just gets the shit out of me.
[370:42.27]Jesus.
[370:43.37]That sucked.
[370:45.83]Oh.
[370:51.28]My back hurts now.
[370:53.12]How do I get... I gotta go... Can I... What?
[370:58.58]Wait a minute.
[371:07.30]I can't move.
[371:16.06]So I can't even go this way.
[371:21.56]I actually can't go this way.
[371:25.13]To the left and then... No, I should be able to.
[371:28.03]Wait a minute.
[371:37.03]Shouldn't I be able to run this way and then around?
[371:45.42]Oh, God.
[371:46.32]I'm in here.
[371:48.05]I'm not in here.
[371:49.07]I'm in here.
[371:52.13]No.
[371:56.45]I'm here.
[371:57.30]So this is a wall.
[371:59.42]I can't go over here.
[372:08.10]Yeah, I'm screwed.
[372:19.29]Well.
[372:30.80]We're going this way.
[372:33.92]And now from here.
[372:38.67]Ah, fuck.
[372:40.19]I have to actually go all the way around?
[372:43.66]I thought I could get in there through here.
[372:47.04]Wait, wasn't I?
[372:48.96]What?
[372:50.18]I'm so confused.
[372:52.88]Because I went through this door.
[372:54.38]Wait a minute.
[372:56.12]Go through this door.
[373:10.99]Okay, so I'm still here.
[373:16.36]Now I'm still... This is incorrect.
[373:23.48]Because now I'm on the other side?
[373:29.85]So this is not a way to... That's like a mountain or something.
[373:34.27]Because I can't go this way.
[373:35.37]Alright, well... We're just going to have to go around.
[373:42.10]So, I mean, may as well just... This is probably faster to go from here.
[373:54.65]And we also get to... You have a huge gun.
[374:07.61]Good.
[374:11.39]Alright, what do you have for a weapon?
[374:12.29]That thing's insane.
[374:16.10]Uh... It's a lying character.
[374:28.02]More range damage.
[374:32.50]Yeah, I want... What if you have, I want it.
[374:34.12]Give it to me.
[374:38.44]Here, you can have a pistol.
[374:41.10]Uh, yeah, I'll take that, please.
[374:43.80]Uh, 747 damage.
[374:47.86]Okay.
[374:47.96]Where is it?
[374:48.36]So this, uh, this, I, okay.
[374:58.25]I'm ready.
[375:11.18]Alright, what do I want for the dentist crew?
[375:30.27]Alright, we're gonna try new dentists.
[375:33.97]But you need a better weapon.
[375:46.56]Okay.
[375:47.86]I want to make sure you have actual weapons.
[375:50.52]That thing's pretty good.
[375:51.28]That thing's not bad.
[375:53.14]You also can level up again.
[375:54.24]Uh, just damage.
[375:58.96]Straight up damage.
[376:01.57]Inventory.
[376:02.23]Okay.
[376:03.89]You have 120.
[376:04.71]That thing, this thing's not good.
[376:06.51]I have to give you something a little better than that, don't I?
[376:09.31]Yeah, you take this one.
[376:15.67]That thing's actually fucking crazy.
[376:17.11]I didn't even know I had that.
[376:25.26]Engineering?
[376:25.90]No, you need something heavier than that.
[376:33.48]Cost of bribes?
[376:34.54]Okay, 16 over.
[376:35.34]That's fine.
[376:39.19]Okay.
[376:41.45]That thing is a heavy gun?
[376:44.29]Okay.
[376:48.34]Take the assault rifle for yourself.
[376:49.76]They need to be not completely just... Nah, I have hers.
[376:56.49]Hers is amazing.
[376:58.85]Just go this way.
[376:59.37]Just go this way.
[377:00.03]This way, this way, this way.
[377:21.61]I can fight one or two of them, but not ten of them.
[377:30.10]This is far, but it's... No, I have to go that way.
[377:35.02]Shit.
[377:35.32]I have to go across the bridge.
[377:43.49]Oh my god.
[377:50.91]I'm dead.
[377:59.08]You can't- that way is locked?
[378:01.18]The bridge is locked from that side.
[378:02.64]Gosh, god damn it.
[378:07.36]So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[378:09.87]Was I actually going the right way?
[378:11.39]To go like all the way down here?
[378:14.61]So this bridge is locked.
[378:26.08]Follow the road south to the other town.
[378:31.38]Uh, there is no town south.
[378:33.02]What?
[378:34.58]Like, was I supposed to go here and then just go all the way down here?
[378:49.52]You can't fast travel.
[378:50.69]Well, there's hostels.
[378:52.81]You can't fast travel.
[378:54.11]There's somebody 5,000 feet away from you.
[378:56.99]You can't do that.
[379:09.19]I can do it over here.
[379:10.21]Okay.
[379:20.99]Now I'm gonna just go straight down and then up this way.
[379:27.45]Let's go.
[379:41.70]Don't go off.
[379:42.44]Don't go up the mountain.
[379:43.26]Try to go for a shortcut.
[379:44.23]Just take the road.
[379:56.59]Just take the road for it.
[379:57.55]Is there the other road?
[380:10.07]Okay, so there's another road here.
[380:14.91]I guess we're taking that one.
[380:20.76]Can I make it from here or do I- am I gonna die going this way?
[380:23.84]Alright, fuck it.
[380:26.76]I'm going for it.
[380:33.08]How am I still standing?
[380:48.98]Who's shooting?
[380:51.70]Okay.
[380:52.80]Road.
[380:54.56]This way.
[380:55.44]Go.
[381:00.52]Ask her for directions?
[381:03.37]Hey.
[381:03.99]Got a favor to ask you.
[381:06.07]No, no, no, no.
[381:06.39]Get on with it.
[381:30.72]I'll be up front with you.
[381:31.96]I hate asking for help.
[381:33.34]I hate it.
[381:34.38]Every time I give someone the opportunity to disappoint me, they seem to make it their most immediate goal.
[381:40.64]But this, what I'm thinking, it's dangerous.
[381:48.53]What do we do?
[381:48.95]Let's do it.
[381:50.13]Here I was, stealing myself for inevitable rejection.
[381:54.13]I used to run with a band of hunters.
[381:56.09]Friends.
[381:57.09]Six of us.
[381:58.38]We were on Monarch when the corporations pulled out, and we helped a lot of people pick up the pieces.
[382:03.72]I haven't seen two of them in years.
[382:05.10]When those pills wear off, are you going to be drunk again?
[382:07.96]I'd like to gather their effects and bury them all in the same places, like the family we once were.
[382:12.64]How do you know that they're dead?
[382:16.99]I saw it happen.
[382:18.95]Hell, one of them was in my arms at the time.
[382:22.05]His name was Hayes, and he's our first stop.
[382:25.29]I buried him a ways from our encampment.
[382:27.96]I'll show you where he rests.
[382:29.66]He had a medallion in his effects.
[382:32.11]That's what I'll bring home to Barry.
[382:33.53]Alright.
[382:36.93]A long time ago, we built an encampment in one of Monarch's cave systems.
[382:41.13]Trouble is, a mana queen showed up and kicked us all out.
[382:45.09]If we can find Rebecca and Anders, they'll know how to lure her out.
[382:47.99]I don't want to find anybody.
[382:49.29]Then we kill the bitch and bury everyone's medallions together.
[382:56.92]Alright, let's go.
[383:00.38]Sounds like a plan.
[383:09.91]It's down there.
[383:10.55]Alright, let's move!
[383:11.41]Go!
[383:24.21]Ooh, nice swing!
[383:27.93]Almost.
[383:31.03]Alright, do your special move!
[383:39.40]Okay, that's a pretty great special move.
[383:42.80]What's your special move?
[383:55.40]What?
[383:56.19]Did you have a thing blocking your head?
[384:10.47]Keep going.
[384:10.88]Keep going.
[384:11.26]Keep going.
[384:11.66]Keep going.
[384:12.74]All the way.
[384:13.40]All the way.
[384:14.14]All the way.
[384:14.48]No!
[384:14.66]You might consider stopping the stream?
[384:15.74]Mmm.
[384:31.79]I considered it and I said no.
[384:56.29]Get this thing away from me!
[385:05.15]I think he got it.
[385:05.93]What?
[385:14.89]See?
[385:15.27]You have a thing blocking your head.
[385:16.65]Ammo.
[385:26.32]Remember how bad I was at keeping ammo?
[385:28.22]Remember how good I got at the game?
[385:38.94]Okay.
[385:39.08]Can we start now?
[385:40.28]Is this game good?
[385:41.34]Yeah, I don't know.
[386:08.23]Yeah, I don't know, though.
[386:09.67]Maybe.
[386:09.97]This is tough.
[386:33.00]Yeah, I mean, it is.
[386:35.49]I can't... Okay, let me give you a little bit of an example here.
[386:39.49]I can't say, I don't want to play this anymore.
[386:44.65]But at the same time, I can't tell you why I am still playing.
[386:50.97]You know what I'm saying?
[386:53.03]It's in that perfect spot of being just enjoyable enough where I'm not going to turn it off.
[387:06.35]I like the scenarios.
[387:08.38]I like the... I like the choices in the scenarios and the easy-to-kill NPCs.
[387:16.36]That sounds fucked up, but it's true.
[387:22.02]It's good.
[387:22.48]It's good.
[387:23.02]And here's the thing.
[387:24.30]Let's check.
[387:36.45]I think that's alright.
[387:38.01]You know what I mean?
[387:39.37]I don't think it has to be a fucking perfect, incredible video.
[387:45.06]It's good.
[387:46.78]It's good.
[387:47.22]Do we know this person?
[387:53.35]Sometimes all you're looking for is just something that's a good game.
[388:06.74]Now, again, I don't know how long this game actually is.
[388:13.29]But I feel like there's still a lot for me to do.
[388:24.20]I'm assuming that... Did you see how many planets there were?
[388:26.98]There's probably a bunch of stuff to do on every one of those planets.
[388:32.60]If you're just looking for a game with stuff to do in it,
[388:37.71]This is for you.
[388:46.29]You're almost done?
[388:47.06]What are you talking about?
[388:56.78]How can I be almost done?
[389:02.18]We have to be careful.
[389:08.29]Alright, here we go.
[389:13.49]Story is short.
[389:15.95]Oh, well, whatever.
[389:17.05]Alright, get in there.
[389:19.23]Run!
[389:45.36]Yeah, somebody mentioned this.
[389:46.82]It's almost like... It's the halfway point between Borderlands and Fallout.
[389:55.26]But not more than halfway.
[390:03.58]It's like they half-developed Borderlands and half-developed Fallout.
[390:18.94]Buried near the surface of Haze's grave is a small lockbox.
[390:20.96]Its hinges rusted through and its wood almost completely rotted.
[390:23.95]It nearly falls apart in your hands.
[390:27.29]And a medallion bearing the letters Sharon.
[390:30.63]Alright, we got it.
[390:36.46]But long story short...
[390:40.31]I think it's good.
[390:41.95]I would say you'd probably like it if you played it.
[390:43.95]Maybe you wouldn't.
[390:45.31]I don't know.
[390:45.79]You've been watching.
[390:47.43]It's up to you.
[390:48.09]Alright, let's go.
[391:11.28]We're almost there.
[391:16.12]It's way less action.
[391:17.16]Yeah.
[391:19.07]It's good.
[391:19.85]Not better than good, but good.
[391:21.39]Yes.
[391:25.37]What do I feel about the game?
[391:29.31]No, you guys already know how I feel about the game.
[391:47.21]Six out of ten?
[391:48.37]Uh, I think that's low.
[391:50.25]I do.
[392:01.37]Not bad, huh?
[392:08.31]Oh shit, it's the bugs.
[392:09.49]I know how to deal with the bugs!
[392:22.97]Am I just missing over and over again?
[392:33.05]This guy is juking me so hard!
[392:35.20]Oh good, you're alive.
[392:46.06]Let's go this way.
[392:46.72]Alright, we need to start ascending.
[392:53.96]Jerma can't formulate an opinion without seeing what Reddit has to say first.
[393:00.59]That's not even true.
[393:03.01]What the fuck?
[393:07.35]Alright, let's get in here.
[393:14.66]No, I haven't formulated a full opinion because I'm like halfway through the game!
[393:21.55]I have a slight opinion, but I'm not done.
[393:24.22]This fucking Redditor over here.
[393:35.51]Oh shit!
[393:38.10]You're... Okay, I thought that was a bandit.
[393:47.53]I used to want to see Reddit first.
[393:52.13]I used to read Reddit.
[393:59.42]Uh-oh.
[394:08.20]We pray at night.
[394:09.20]We stalk at night.
[394:10.14]Best character.
[394:12.27]You want to try to tell me that you don't think that's a good character now?
[394:15.05]Okay.
[394:15.19]Lie.
[394:19.36]There's too many of these Queens.
[394:22.08]This is death if I try to fight these things.
[394:28.33]Oh, fuck.
[394:28.99]Are there any of you there?
[394:34.27]It's just... It's all of them.
[394:39.88]Oh, man.
[394:40.42]We have to fight it.
[394:40.94]We have to fight it.
[394:41.46]We have to fight it.
[394:42.02]We have to fight it.
[394:42.60]We have to.
[394:53.25]There's so many people Ow
[395:32.43]Is shock good on you?
[395:37.34]That seriously does more damage.
[395:40.28]It does more damage.
[395:40.90]It does more damage.
[395:41.38]Just run.
[395:41.64]Man, there's bugs and shit.
[395:47.49]Flying ants, whatever the hell they are.
[396:09.90]Alright, super gun.
[396:15.26]I should have been the head?
[396:19.28]Are you healing?
[396:34.41]Why won't you just die?
[396:36.33]Fuck!
[396:38.15]Just die!
[396:47.50]Oh my god.
[396:58.89]After too many encounters with Manta Paws and Mantasaurs, you're not quite yourself when any of the Manta family of creatures are attacking you.
[397:09.66]Dexterity minus one, minus one, minus one when you're surrounded by them.
[397:14.66]That's worth it.
[397:15.86]I don't care.
[397:16.28]I'm scared of giant monsters.
[397:17.86]Wow, that's so strange.
[397:21.70]How odd to be terrified of something that's five times bigger than you and has claws like a lobster.
[397:28.94]Okay.
[397:31.54]I get a free perk.
[397:41.36]Uh...
[397:44.13]Max beater?
[397:49.33]Maybe the armor rating.
[397:56.50]Walk speed.
[398:00.60]Ultra beater?
[398:01.20]What are you talking about?
[398:02.54]What does that mean?
[398:06.00]Movement penalty accuracy?
[398:07.24]Uh...
[398:13.28]Walk speed is good in combat?
[398:16.50]I'll take it, you're right.
[398:17.40]Oh my fucking god.
[398:28.99]This sucks.
[398:35.13]How much damage am I... Okay, what do I have for weapons?
[398:40.51]This is like fire, fire, normal, normal.
[398:45.66]Do I have anything else?
[398:46.34]What about this?
[398:47.22]What about shock?
[398:48.80]Let me try electric shock damage.
[399:00.47]Oh, that's awful.
[399:04.85]Four.
[399:05.71]And they're already dead.
[399:13.68]they're both dead this is wonderful all I have is fire weapons versus fire type is there a water type
[399:45.53]No, don't run away and get all your energy back.
[399:48.41]Oh, that's so... I'm clearly behind you.
[399:51.53]You're not gonna run away from me.
[400:05.32]Oh my god, I am.
[400:13.60]Dude, I can't even hurt these things.
[400:15.39]I seriously can't even hurt them.
[400:24.93]Hit them with something bigger?
[400:26.43]What do I have that's bigger?
[400:29.53]I'm just running by them.
[400:40.30]Fucking dumbass mountain.
[400:49.82]Oh my god, are these people good?
[400:54.20]Help!
[400:54.82]Help!
[400:55.60]Help!
[400:56.72]Help!
[400:57.84]Help!
[401:00.26]How do I get one of those guns?
[401:02.31]You shot it once and it died.
[401:03.71]Guys, help!
[401:05.27]I'm on fire.
[401:06.15]Help!
[401:06.53]Thank you.
[401:20.72]Streamer would rather wear funny haha costumes I'm laughing because it's true like I mean, that's just that's real I probably could have like an extra 20 armor each if I wasn't wearing the dentist uniform
[401:50.85]That's, you're right.
[401:52.00]What am I gonna say, like, shut up, you don't know what you're talking about.
[401:55.92]No, you know exactly what you're talking about.
[402:00.84]Carry on.
[402:04.98]They don't have anything to say?
[402:11.73]What?
[402:13.21]Wait, this is not your outpost?
[402:16.03]Help, I need help.
[402:17.83]Help!
[402:21.09]Everybody get back here!
[402:24.03]Come help me!
[402:26.63]What am I getting shot by?
[402:27.89]Guys, do something!
[402:30.67]Do something!
[402:32.73]Help!
[402:35.48]Shoot them!
[402:36.48]Oh my god, the Terminator just showed up!
[402:39.32]Somebody do something!
[402:44.48]What?!
[402:46.00]Why?! !

[403:41.83]Oh, I'm sorry.
[403:42.57]Okay, talk.
[403:45.57]I already tried to do this.
[403:46.81]This station's under the protection of the corporate compliance crew.
[403:50.89]You a marauder?
[403:52.19]Because me and my sunshine, that's my gun if you were wondering, we don't take kindly to marauders.
[403:59.54]Uh, no.
[404:02.68]A coherent enough response, I reckon.
[404:05.20]Must be true.
[404:06.87]You're clear, but I would caution you against pressing on ahead.
[404:10.21]This station's plum crawling with marauders, you know?
[404:15.27]What are you doing up here?
[404:16.33]I take it you ain't met the other C3s.
[404:19.59]Me and Sunshine are doing exactly what we've been tasked with.
[404:22.92]You want more details?
[404:25.34]You ought to talk to my crew.
[404:27.52]They're guarding a small barracks to the southeast by the edge of the mountain.
[404:33.34]Okay.
[404:36.33]What about you?
[404:39.35]Oh, I tried talking to you.
[404:40.45]How am I supposed to get over there?
[404:42.13]Can you help me?
[404:43.43]Is this person being held hostage in there?
[405:19.16]What's my sneak at?
[405:23.30]Uh, what's my sneak at?
[405:43.03]Save it in here.
[405:46.27]Turn around.
[405:52.53]Turn that way so I can go over here.
[405:53.93]I'll duck all the way back over here.
[405:58.25]I had a little trouble there.
[406:00.23]Okay.
[406:02.59]Now I wait for you to... I don't know what to do.
[406:26.54]An AI wouldn't do that.
[406:30.20]An AI would just walk back and forth.
[406:32.20]It wouldn't do a pose, aim thing.
[406:53.71]Come on, hurry up.
[407:01.89]Come on, come on, come on, come on!
[407:02.75]Okay, safe.
[407:06.47]Alright, let's take this guy out.
[407:10.39]Nice and quiet.
[407:12.36]Who needs sneak?
[407:37.40]I don't have the backstab perk.
[407:39.38]I thought I unlocked a backstab thing.
[407:44.94]Didn't I?
[407:45.30]That's the only reason why I did this.
[407:51.33]Sneak attack.
[407:51.91]Attack unaware enemies while crouched to deal bonus damage.
[407:56.63]Okay.
[407:56.77]Okay.
[408:08.99]Guys, hurry up.
[408:11.13]Hurry up and get in here.
[408:13.41]Get in the grass.
[408:15.45]In the grass.
[408:20.97]Okay, fine.
[408:33.15]Easy.
[408:35.22]Okay sneaking by don't mind me just don't turn around Okay, this is good, I don't know Dog dog
[409:09.41]What the fuck is that noise?
[409:15.94]Oh shit, where's he going?
[409:20.24]Good dog, good dog.
[409:21.64]Stop talking.
[409:27.60]Door's sealed?
[409:28.27]Uh oh.
[409:43.46]Get the fuck out of here.
[409:50.05]Let's go.
[409:50.45]How does he know we're here?
[409:52.97]How did we snuck in here?
[409:53.89]How did he know we were in here?
[410:22.83]Well, he knows now.
[410:33.73]Oh, I can't get in.
[410:34.37]Alright, fuck it.
[410:37.72]We're going up there.
[410:38.92]What?
[410:39.10]Face to intercom.
[410:51.86]Where's the intercom?
[410:53.68]I can't tell if you're brave or simply touched in the head.
[410:56.84]What in the galaxy are you doing sniffing around my station?
[410:59.94]Unless you are, in fact, trying to suicide by Marauder?
[411:03.91]And you, Niyoka, what are you doing lugging a stranger into my station?
[411:09.07]You could use the socialization, you son of a bitch.
[411:13.43]Also, he hired me.
[411:16.08]I need to see the information broker about... Oh.
[411:17.94]Oh.
[411:41.80]And since my hired hands have clearly turned idle, it appears I need you to clear out the threat.
[411:47.22]As my newest contractor, you may call me the broker.
[411:53.09]Or we can call you Hiram, on account of that's your damn name, and doubly on the account of the broker being a dumbass alternative.
[412:01.01]What?
[412:01.89]Everyone calls me that, aside from you.
[412:05.87]No emotion.
[412:07.21]Me?
[412:08.43]You're here, and you're armed, aren't you?
[412:11.06]The feed's gone grainy, but it looks like you're packing deadly force.
[412:15.54]I know Neoka is, for sure.
[412:18.00]I barricaded the broadcast center, but I can only hold out for so long.
[412:21.81]Clear the marauders out, and I'll pay you double the going rate.
[412:24.81]Okay, easy.
[412:25.53]They destroy the transmission equipment, and I'll be out of business.
[412:28.47]Just kill everyone in this whole area.
[412:31.55]Got it.
[412:32.35]Hurry before I have to lock them down again.
[412:33.95]Let's see what I can do.
[412:38.52]Okay, kill marauders.
[412:46.86]Okay.
[412:55.39]Let's get it.
[413:04.54]Oh, thanks.
[413:06.02]Thanks for helping me.
[413:10.84]Going up!
[413:21.14]Kill Marauders.
[413:23.53]Kill Marauders.
[413:24.39]Nice one!
[413:54.96]I'm gonna die.
[413:57.78]I'm itching my fucking nose.
[413:59.16]No, no, no, no.
[414:00.02]Itchy nose.
[414:00.66]God damn it.
[414:01.70]Why do my nose hairs have to tingle inside of my nose?
[414:14.23]Son of a god damn it.
[414:36.65]Good hit, right in the mouth.
[414:43.80]What am I doing?
[414:44.70]What am I doing?
[414:49.44]My eyes just glazed over completely.
[414:51.81]I just glazed over and just was trying to press C. But I already- Why could I not do both of their moves?
[415:07.32]Okay, some V. So what happened?
[415:14.97]So why couldn't I do C?
[415:15.91]I didn't even bolt.
[415:21.38]What?
[415:21.68]What are you talking about?
[415:50.05]I think it was a bait.
[415:52.17]Oh no!
[415:54.79]No!
[415:55.01]He died in two seconds.
[416:01.70]That was just like f-f-f-f-dead.
[416:03.24]Oh.
[416:04.14]What the hell was that?
[416:20.26]How did you even get... You were in the room with me.
[416:23.84]My weapons suck.
[416:24.82]I have to repair my weapons.
[416:28.20]That's the problem.
[416:28.92]Why did you just moonwalk out there to die?
[416:36.43]I don't know what that was for.
[416:56.29]Some of these are missing because the gun's broken.
[416:57.85]That has to be what's going on.
[416:58.83]Is that it?
[417:10.96]And maybe equip some armor?
[417:13.96]That's asking too much.
[417:14.98]You're not going to show yourself?
[417:28.32]Dude your pattern is so fucking weird.
[417:31.94]It's freaking me out.
[417:58.27]Okay, fucking finally.
[418:06.61]I have to repair these weapons.
[418:17.16]Can I repair it on the fly?
[418:20.78]I can repair all equipment.
[418:24.48]Can I just repair individual?
[418:25.96]Here we go.
[418:34.73]Okay, we're good.
[418:37.58]Keycard.
[418:39.24]Now, let's make our way... Cavern?
[418:44.75]Points.
[418:45.05]100... I have 112.
[418:47.33]Lying.
[419:14.54]I don't know why I thought there wasn't going to be anybody in here.
[419:30.40]What happened to shaving streams this week?
[419:33.00]I really mainly meant yesterday and tomorrow.
[419:36.86]Because tomorrow is going to be probably like four or five hours.
[419:41.61]Yesterday was like four and a half, so...
[419:49.27]Open the door.
[419:49.91]Marauder free at last.
[419:52.01]I'll get the door.
[419:53.05]You hurry on in.
[419:59.80]Hello?
[420:00.74]Never thought I'd be ecstatic at having the walls painted in blood, but seeing as it's not mine, I'd say this calls for a celebration.
[420:08.96]This ought to square our debt.
[420:11.38]One hefty payment for a highly valued service rendered.
[420:14.38]But I admit, I do wonder why Nyoka has brought you to me.
[420:19.51]Allow me to pose my question in another manner.
[420:22.03]Why, in the Nebula, are you here?
[420:33.10]You know why I'm here.
[420:33.98]Can we continue our conversations from the intercom?
[420:36.88]If you insist.
[420:37.98]As I was telling you before, I am the premier broker for all of Monarch.
[420:43.00]Phineas must have sent you.
[420:44.71]He's the only one insane enough to send someone to Monarch to rush me.
[420:48.64]I don't care
[421:18.01]Caring or not won't change the facts of the matter.
[421:21.23]I am awaiting but a single incoming transmission containing the information we desire.
[421:26.17]But MSI and the Iconoclasts are clogging the airwaves from Stellar Bay and Amber Heights.
[421:30.83]End of the stream, boys?
[421:31.69]Yeah.
[421:32.13]They're scrambling each other's outgoing transmissions.
[421:33.88]Once this is completed, I'm taking off.
[421:39.86]This is a problem.
[421:40.60]Okay, so we kick them off.
[421:41.78]Get them out of here.
[421:42.26]Exactly what I was thinking.
[421:43.38]Wait, who?
[421:43.68]They hurt us all with their pettiness.
[421:45.61]Who is he talking about?
[421:46.23]Which of course has inadvertently affected the incoming port and my livelihood.
[421:55.82]Where in Stella Bay?
[421:56.72]My former partner, Sanjar, transmits from his office in MSI's headquarters in the center of town.
[422:02.88]Don't let him try to fool you.
[422:04.82]While his messages might seem like gibberish, they are in reality coded business orders to off-world companies.
[422:12.19]I understand why he needs the bandwidth, but we had a deal and he's broadcasting ceaselessly.
[422:19.36]I kind of like that guy, though.
[422:25.08]No, they're jamming the limited frequencies we have at our disposal.
[422:28.64]Nothing extra planetary can get in or out until the frequency pollution thins out.
[422:33.53]He's evil?
[422:33.81]Do we know that yet?
[422:41.56]I could just kill them all.
[422:45.42]I'll talk some sense into that.
[422:46.60]You do that, I'll be here waiting on the receiving end.
[422:49.68]Luck be with you.
[422:50.82]I have a feeling you'll be needing a pinch of it, plus a vat of patience.
[422:56.82]Uh, we need a favor.
[422:58.12]Oh, great.
[422:58.98]I love doing pro bono work for friends.
[423:02.16]Aw, you called us friends.
[423:04.92]I'd normally entertain your self-aggrandizing delusions, but this time it's important.
[423:10.19]important to you is not the same as important to me although I do recognize that you may have earned some goodwill this guy's boring the fuck out of me once laboring for me whoa hey there is zero yeah just do it now hurry up look I'll do what I can alright Rebecca hodges and anders watsworth they took a udl contract back when monarch went to ship and I need to find them I believe them to be on terra too
[423:39.90]If UDL hired two hunters back then, it would have been for creature clearing purposes around one of their spacer's choice outposts.
[423:47.10]These are the coordinates for the outpost under the last UDL contract.
[423:50.64]Now scram.
[423:52.08]And, uh, good luck.
[423:54.00]Did it say scram?
[423:54.98]Alright, goodbye.
[423:57.48]Neoka, pick me up some stimulation and a bottle of purple berry wine when you're next in Stellar Bay.
[424:06.81]Alright.
[424:08.52]So, whatever he said.
[424:09.42]I don't know.
[424:09.74]Whatever it was.
[424:10.22]Uh, we'll find out tomorrow.
[424:13.42]I'll take all this stuff.
[424:17.26]That's a flamethrower.
[424:27.03]Okay.
[424:28.45]Uh, so we're gonna continue tomorrow.
[424:30.47]And we will see if the stream tomorrow is gonna continue
[424:37.78]I might be able just to beat it tomorrow.
[424:40.26]It's possible.
[424:45.10]If I'm like halfway, more than halfway through the game, it's possible.
[424:49.39]But I'm probably going to be streaming for about four or five hours.
[424:53.77]Maybe.
[424:56.79]We'll see.
[424:58.39]I'm probably not even close.
[425:04.78]Because I streamed this yesterday for like four and a half hours, and I'm probably only going to stream tomorrow for like four or five hours.
[425:11.64]This is the one in the middle.
[425:14.34]Like today.
[425:14.76]Yeah, I... Yeah, I was going to stop like a couple hours ago.
[425:22.03]But I was getting into it.
[425:23.73]I'm just getting kind of tired.
[425:40.71]You're into the dentist cosplay.
[425:44.42]Yeah.
[425:45.38]We'll see if I continue it.
[425:46.98]At least some of them.
[425:47.70]Because I really probably should just put on, like, real armor.
[425:50.94]We'll see.
[425:52.14]Alright, but that's it for today.
[425:54.30]Thanks for watching, guys.
[425:55.50]We'll see you tomorrow.
[426:00.29]And we'll see what happens at the end of that stream.
[426:07.15]Any news on the green screen?
[426:08.13]Yeah, the Discord channel is open.
[426:11.33]There's a Discord channel.
[426:12.99]Talked about it yesterday, I think.
[426:15.75]For suggestions and actions, that stream is going to happen somewhere probably December 10th, 11th, maybe 12th.
[426:25.88]Please put your favorite actions there and discuss them.
[426:30.58]If I do not see you tomorrow, happy Thanksgiving, those of you that celebrate it.
[426:34.27]And if... By the way, stream is probably going to start a little bit later.
[426:38.17]Later.
[426:39.80]Just to kind of stream after most people do their Thanksgiving festivities.
[426:46.76]So the stream tomorrow will be about 4 p.m.
[426:50.14]Pacific.
[426:52.74]Channel's not open.
[426:53.98]Is it not?
[426:55.22]Well, it will be very soon.
[426:59.90]Like within the next hour.
[427:02.42]Probably.
[427:05.30]Oh, God.
[427:05.50]Alright, there we go.
[427:06.89]Jackets on the case.
[427:09.01]But yeah, I will see you guys tomorrow.
[427:12.33]We'll keep going.
[427:14.07]Let me just do a hard save.
[427:17.59]Just in case.
[427:19.96]And we'll move on to the bits.
[427:20.84]I'll see you guys soon.
[427:22.36]Happy Thanksgiving.
[427:23.72]Maybe we'll see you tomorrow.
[427:28.53]That's the end.
[427:39.56]Let us rewind the clock.
[427:42.90]To earlier... Does it work?
[427:47.70]No.
[427:48.66]Nope.
[427:50.96]I have to check it every time.
[427:54.38]I think it's good.
[428:08.93]Like I said earlier, it's just... It's good enough for me to want to play.
[428:14.60]I think it's interesting enough.
[428:25.40]I will hold final judgments.
[428:28.31]Until... I either finish it, or get real close.
[428:36.17]But somebody said 6 out of 10, I think that's low.
[428:41.09]I do think it's higher than that.
[428:46.46]Also, uh... I got Fallen Order, and I highly recommend you play it if you haven't already.
[428:52.22]Have a good night.
[428:58.25]I... don't know if you'll see Fallen Order on stream.
[429:07.51]Depends on how much room there is for content.
[429:22.06]And by content, I mean how much room there is for... Somebody said, good, good.
[429:31.50]I've heard it as, oh, it's like Dark Souls and... I don't know, maybe...
[429:39.05]I would probably just do that on my own time.
[429:41.97]But I said that about God of War and I got like halfway through God of War and I stopped playing it.
[429:46.88]So.
[429:49.06]That's part of the reason why I don't play that many AAA single player games.
[429:53.04]Is because a lot of them are long.
[429:56.11]And I lose interest pretty quickly.
[430:00.69]If I sit there and play a game for 12, 15, 20 plus hours, usually it has to grab me completely.
[430:08.80]Or I'm just going to stop slowly playing it.
[430:17.35]But we'll see.
[430:18.07]I haven't... There's going to be a lull in content here.
[430:22.76]Once all these new games come out.
[430:24.88]That sort of no man's land of January into February.
[430:28.50]Not a whole lot of shit comes out.
[430:30.44]So we'll see.
[430:34.95]Oh, okay.
[430:35.47]I see what you're doing right.
[430:40.39]But thank you.
[430:41.83]I've heard it's sort of interesting.
[430:45.61]Thank you Gnarly for the 250.
[430:46.73]I thought I liked this streamer, but I seriously can't fucking stand the haha I have a fake Boston accent joke.
[430:53.80]I bet this clown hasn't even been there.
[430:55.46]Does anyone know how to refund gift subs?
[430:58.32]Good night.
[431:03.67]Well, I mean... I have never been to Boston, England.
[431:16.54]so I mean a fake Boston like England like English accent that's not incorrect refund this guy's bits no I'm keeping him no keeping him hey Martin had a meme thanks to the 500 bits these bits are for felix
[431:49.09]What if I just opened up the stream tomorrow?
[431:51.83]Without even introducing the stream.
[431:55.13]There's no starting soon screen.
[431:59.29]And I just... It's scoped on his head.
[432:01.54]And I just shoot him in the head.
[432:05.30]And then I do an introduction.
[432:06.30]I wonder how many people would be upset by that.
[432:17.69]We'll see how much of a villain I want to play tomorrow afternoon.
[432:21.98]We'll find out.
[432:33.00]Maybe.
[432:34.26]It's possible.
[432:38.28]But, thank you for the 500 bits.
[432:41.14]Appreciate it.
[432:41.56]Thank you, Plank, for the 500 bits.
[432:42.96]I recently joined a band, and one of the songs they play live, they shout, rats, rats, because of the rat movie.
[432:49.72]Also, happy early flag day.
[432:52.64]jermaEarth, jermaHeart.
[432:58.83]That sounds like pretty, that sounds pretty pog.
[433:03.57]I'm talking, I'm with it.
[433:07.05]uh yeah thank you for the 500 bits plank appreciate it thanks for the and thanks for the flag day I guess uh Dr. flexlin thanks for the 250 bits I had a dream where jermaPain was a bath bomb with a bunch of gold glitter it would actually look more like jermaPop but yeah that's weird
[433:34.47]Hey Dark Soul, thanks for the 250 bits.
[433:39.17]You're pretty good at this.
[433:40.63]I'm sure you'll do well on this platform.
[433:43.27]Actually, I might have some bits for you myself.
[433:45.66]Why don't you come to my place and do some streams from there?
[433:48.46]It's mostly Metroid Prime that needs streaming, but some Mega Man Battle Network needs attention too.
[433:53.66]I don't have many bits, but I can give you some pro tips as a reward.
[433:56.50]I'm sure you can use them.
[434:08.46]What happened?
[434:13.26]Mega Man Battle Network.
[434:14.66]That's something I have not heard in a long time.
[434:20.99]Uh, thank you.
[434:22.31]Thank you, Newton, for the thousand bits.
[434:27.93]900 bits here and they say forgot to add an extra zero.
[434:31.85]Appreciate it, Newton.
[434:35.37]Thank you so much for the thousand bits.
[434:38.18]Ten bucks.
[434:44.44]Oh, it was the porn dialogue.
[434:45.70]Okay, I get it.
[434:46.22]Let's get the credits to roll.
[434:54.91]Switch on over.
[434:56.95]Camera on?
[434:57.43]Nope.
[435:01.35]Thanks for the subs, guys.
[435:05.56]All of you.
[435:09.67]Much love to you.
[435:14.32]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[435:16.96]He hates my joke and then hits me.
[435:21.74]No, I didn't know what it was.
[435:23.52]I don't... Thank you so much, all of you that have subbed this channel.
[435:32.77]You're fucking great.
[435:34.21]Thank you, Filactory Lich, for the $500.
[435:36.51]50,000 bits in one drop an hour ago.
[435:38.75]Also insane.
[435:48.37]Stinky Beaver, thanks for the 500 bits.
[435:50.79]Happy Thanksgiving.
[435:51.53]Happy Thanksgiving to you too.
[435:53.57]Hope you have a good one.
[435:56.47]The Plushie, thanks for the 500 bits, Plushie.
[435:59.23]Hey Jerm, I recently lost all my friends and my mother and my dog are dying.
[436:02.73]Is there anything you do or think that helps you through tough times?
[436:05.50]Well, that's fucking horrible.
[436:09.24]That sounds absolutely terrible.
[436:20.90]Damn, that's a heavy load there.
[436:25.79]Seriously.
[436:32.93]Take care of yourself.
[436:33.87]If there's anything you do you think that helps you through tough times.
[436:43.62]Honestly, for me at least...
[436:48.62]And this is obviously not any professional opinion or anything, which I would implore anybody and everybody to do.
[436:57.98]If you think the weight of the world is too much and you're going through too much shit, please contact somebody that is capable of being able to help you through that.
[437:14.35]But for me,
[437:17.15]I can't it's for I'll give you just a perfect example of recent right recently I've been having a this is definitely obviously not even close to a ton of of the issues that you're describing but just in general talking about what helps you through like tough times right so I've had this medical problem that I can't figure out it's been something I've been trying to figure out for like a year off and on it's just been there it's been annoying it's been irritating and
[437:46.84]It's almost like you have to look at a telescope in like a year, a couple of years into the future.
[437:54.48]And at the end, you're hoping that as time goes along, you'll figure out what's going on.
[438:00.54]You can deal with the problems that you have.
[438:04.73]So for me, I try not to focus on the exact moment that's happening and I try to focus on what's potentially going to be the solution in the future.
[438:16.87]day to day, essentially.
[438:24.53]And like Jacket just said, therapy is cool.
[438:27.79]If you need it, use it.
[438:29.18]Please use it.
[438:29.82]Yes.
[438:33.92]For me to tell you these things is not the equivalent of somebody who is equipped and qualified to help take care of some of the issues you're going through.
[438:47.82]If you're going through shit, if you're having horrible problems, and if shit's not looking good, get some help.
[438:55.38]There's nothing wrong with it.
[439:02.85]There's absolutely nothing wrong with taking care of yourself.
[439:13.14]That's kind of how I think about it.
[439:18.50]I go to therapy every week.
[439:19.54]Trust me, it helps so much.
[439:21.54]Yeah, I'm glad to hear that.
[439:29.19]I wish you the best.
[439:34.61]I know it's, you know, easier for me to say, hey, I wish you the best, right?
[439:41.31]But I really do.
[439:42.03]I really do hope that you can figure out
[439:46.77]All that because that sounds like a lot Sub chat sometimes is wholesome Yeah, it's nice to just hang out and talk about random stuff because the stream is just kind of
[440:12.21]Stream's over right now, right?
[440:13.49]This is just kind of the post.
[440:16.19]We just chill.
[440:18.47]I like it.
[440:27.85]But yeah.
[440:30.10]You are number one.
[440:35.34]You always should try to be taking care of yourself as best you can.
[440:42.77]And however that means, for you to get it to take the steps necessary to do that, you have to take them.
[440:53.66]Slowly.
[440:56.24]Any prospects on Baldcoin?
[440:57.58]I'm holding out for a rally this holiday season.
[441:03.68]Baldcoin went to zero.
[441:04.72]There are no exchanges that even trade it.
[441:07.92]It has been delisted from every exchange.
[441:12.34]And there was a 1 million coin supply.
[441:14.58]And I burnt 999,000 of them.
[441:17.14]I'm sorry.
[441:27.04]So therefore, I put so much money into that.
[441:32.03]Well, thank you for this journey that I've been on and you've been able to put me on.
[441:37.05]Thank you for the journey and joining me on this journey that I'm...
[441:45.39]You ever notice when somebody or group or thing takes a shitload of money from people?
[441:52.09]At the very end, they always say, Thank you for doing this journey with me.
[441:58.45]What the fuck are you talking about?
[442:00.01]It's not a journey.
[442:10.06]You took my money and spent it.
[442:19.99]Yeah, your journey.
[442:22.18]Your journey going to the Audi dealership.
[442:30.44]And then the journey driving back to your garage.
[442:40.59]It's always so interesting, though.
[442:43.85]Our journey together.
[442:45.27]You losing a shitload of money.
[442:54.60]I lost 10k on bald coin.
[442:57.56]Alright, we're almost done here.
[442:58.58]Gondar Lane, thanks for the 250.
[442:59.50]When are you going to return to DOS?
[443:02.61]Soon.
[443:04.53]Very soon.
[443:05.65]Soon.
[443:10.41]Thank you for this journey that we've gone on to play DOS.
[443:15.28]It'll eventually happen.
[443:17.83]The Gray Angel thinks of the 250.
[443:18.87]If you're looking for a good game, you should try out A Hat in Time.
[443:21.36]It's a super cute platformer in the same vein as Banjo and Kazooie.
[443:25.42]Also, it's got multiplayer mode in which you play levels with 50 people at once.
[443:28.80]That's kind of insane.
[443:31.92]I've seen Hat in Time recommended a bunch.
[443:39.82]Maybe you'd see it.
[443:41.06]Like I said, there's going to be a string where there's not a whole lot of stuff going on.
[443:44.91]Early 2020.
[443:49.49]We'll see.
[443:52.23]Hey, Medi Marin, thanks for the thousand bits right now.
[443:55.43]Two minutes ago, $10.
[443:56.07]Thank you.
[443:57.93]I wish I had more money to give, but I want to say thanks for making content for as long as you have.
[444:02.48]I've been watching you since middle school, even up into college.
[444:05.60]It's becoming a bit harder to catch some streams, but whenever I get the chance to stream, it's the perfect way to relax.
[444:10.58]Thanks for the past many years and the years ahead of us.
[444:14.62]Thank you, Medi.
[444:18.58]It's sometimes weird to think about that I've been doing this for so long that people that may have been watching the channel when they were a teenager or a middle schooler is now in college.
[444:36.50]Or people that were in high school or college might now be married with kids.
[444:43.38]It's interesting.
[444:52.48]Unlike you.
[444:58.89]So?
[444:59.47]Not everybody has to get married.
[445:01.71]Not everybody has to have kids.
[445:05.83]Not everybody has to... Thank you for taking this journey with me.
[445:09.91]Appreciate it, guys.
[445:19.47]What?
[445:19.91]You guys don't... You guys don't want to live... the dink lifestyle?
[445:27.48]Double income, no kids?
[445:34.03]What are you talking about?
[445:49.21]That's the best lifestyle, to be honest.
[445:54.32]I mean, kids are expensive.
[445:57.40]Especially multiple kids.
[446:05.15]We'll see.
[446:05.61]I mean, maybe eventually somewhere.
[446:07.55]I mean, I have to pass down the Gerber985 Twitch and YouTube channel to somebody.
[446:13.61]It's gotta be my son or daughter.
[446:28.03]You're a millionaire, though.
[446:30.83]I am not a fucking millionaire.
[446:33.03]Germany is the .985%.
[446:44.80]Millionaire.
[446:45.54]Nope.
[446:58.74]Not, not really.
[447:01.32]Not even close, actually.
[447:03.20]Not even remotely close.
[447:06.88]But, you know, maybe one day.
[447:10.64]I gotta get one of those sweet sponsorships.
[447:17.37]And then I'm just gonna blow it all on fucking streams.
[447:35.10]Big bits.
[447:35.68]No.
[447:41.54]No, no, no.
[447:47.32]Really?
[447:47.64]Goddammit.
[447:53.63]I mean, like, what the fuck?
[447:57.87]It's not a millionaire?
[447:59.13]Okay, whatever.
[448:01.29]What the fuck?
[448:12.71]What the fuck?
[448:13.29]Can we get 10k likes, please?
[448:16.07]Fuck.
[448:25.88]If this gets 5,000 retweets, it'll make me feel better.
[448:28.90]I just wanted a million dollars.
[448:39.94]Now, imagine I wrote that on Twitter.
[448:44.15]How, uh, people with no context... I would get... I would get mutilated on Twitter for that.
[448:53.62]That would be... I would... I would see the wrath for that tweet.
[449:03.61]Like... You just can't.
[449:06.63]I can't.
[449:08.61]I cannot, like, make, like, a I'm not a millionaire joke.
[449:13.38]That's like just not okay.
[449:22.78]Who gives a shit?
[449:23.64]Who gives a shit?
[449:30.84]No, don't you know we talk about tweets that I'm gonna do and I don't make them.
[449:34.70]I don't even use Twitter.
[449:37.12]I painstakingly opened this thing to like write about a stream that I'm about to start doing.
[449:47.38]My last two real tweets was a picture that I took at TwitchCon and then two months later telling you I'm not at TwitchCon anymore.
[450:05.61]It doesn't even have an auto setup.
[450:06.79]No, I don't trust the fucking robots.
[450:13.59]Anyways, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[450:21.03]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[450:24.59]AKA, you're lazy.
[450:25.77]I just don't really do it.
[450:28.91]I can't even... Okay, I know... Before I go.
[450:32.48]There are people that tweet like 5, 10, 15 times a day.
[450:39.52]I couldn't even think... I can't even think of one thing to write to you guys a week.
[450:43.07]It's like, what am I... How do I do that?
[450:51.98]For me to write more than 5 to 10 tweets a day, I'd have to tell you about my bowel movements.
[450:58.83]Oh, that was a good one.
[451:00.95]I feel nice and, uh, relieved.
[451:14.56]You know what?
[451:14.90]If somebody gave me a challenge to tweet 10 times a day and they had to be... You couldn't just write, like, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, delete.
[451:21.97]You couldn't just do the alphabet 10 times.
[451:24.23]Like, actually write 10 tweets over the course of a day.
[451:27.51]That would be very hard for me to do. ...
[451:44.77]I did miss one bit.
[451:46.59]Yeah, I did.
[451:47.13]I went over it, you're right.
[451:50.47]From Smelly Boy.
[451:51.33]Thank you, Smelly Boy, for the 250.
[451:53.61]This game looks very neat.
[451:55.47]Also, during Thanksgiving dinner, do you prefer your cranberry sauce to be the stuff that has actual cranberries in it, or just the big fucking jelly slab?
[452:03.13]I'm a jelly slab type of dude myself.
[452:07.85]I will take it both ways.
[452:10.21]Jelly slab is good.
[452:13.04]Jelly slab is good to spread over the turkey.
[452:15.36]Because it's easy to do that.
[452:17.66]But, with the cranberry chunks in it... I kind of like putting that in my mashed potatoes.
[452:24.45]Just like a little dollop of it, so it's in the center.
[452:26.83]And you go in and grab a little bit of the chunks of the... It gives the mashed potatoes a little bit more.
[452:35.70]It can be... It's very versatile.
[452:42.15]Jelly slab makes a great sandwich.
[452:43.49]They all do.
[452:46.00]Put it on the mash?
[452:48.62]Um, I don't think it does.
[452:50.88]Thanksgiving dinner, it doesn't matter where it is.
[452:53.72]Just put everything on the plate and just mush it up and mix it around.
[452:56.34]Spin your fork around in a circle.
[452:58.67]It's still gonna be great.
[453:08.45]Put it on the ground then.
[453:14.14]Alright, guys, I'll see you tomorrow.
[453:15.22]We're gonna see how far we get in, um... Outer Worlds.
[453:19.61]Like I said, at the end of that stream, we will... We will have a meeting of the dentists to find out if it's something that I want to keep doing.
[453:27.59]If not, we'll move on to something else.
[453:34.48]Again, tomorrow's stream, I know I'm saying that it might be short.
[453:39.00]But it probably will be, because...
[453:44.66]Yeah, there's, like... I know it's Thanksgiving and I'm not doing, like, Thanksgiving on Thanksgiving, but there's also... There's other stuff going on that I might have to do.
[453:56.92]I gotta make a round of phone calls that day and I wanna talk to my parents and shit for a while, so... I mean, when I talk to my mother on holidays, I talk to her usually for, like, an hour or two.
[454:10.55]We'll see.
[454:11.27]We'll see.
[454:11.65]I wanna make sure I get it all done.
[454:17.11]But I'll see you tomorrow.
[454:18.51]Remember, it's going to start later, not at like 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock.
[454:21.90]It's going to be around 4 p.m.
[454:23.94]Pacific time.
[454:25.76]Enjoy your turkey.
[454:27.52]See you tomorrow, guys.
[454:29.84]Take care.
