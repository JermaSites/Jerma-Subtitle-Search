[00:10.39]Hello, my constituents.
[00:14.05]Welcome.
[00:17.20]To favor the king.
[00:20.20]It is I, Jerma985, your king, your ruler.
[00:26.46]And I just have one thing to say.
[00:27.94]Bonjour.
[00:31.83]Can we get a bunch of bonjours in the chat, please?
[00:43.51]What a glorious day it is for favoring your king!
[00:49.96]Those of you that don't know how this is gonna work, uh, this one's only actually gonna work.
[00:55.40]Last time we did this, uh, it was a little bit of a problem.
[01:00.75]This server is fucking clean!
[01:05.37]Yes, it's not- it is not the other one.
[01:08.23]It is not the F-word.
[01:10.66]Somebody just threw me an emerald.
[01:13.22]People throwing me jewels?
[01:17.18]I don't want to get rid of this.
[01:19.90]Of course you would send jewels to your king.
[01:21.98]What am I speaking of?
[01:22.96]Where are you getting the snowballs?
[01:31.55]Where are these?
[01:32.67]There's no snow on this map.
[01:36.99]How many people are in here? 10,000?
[01:39.60]Is it 8,000 people in this game right now?
[01:41.04]Something like that.
[01:44.18]But we have some events to do.
[01:45.74]We have a lot of things to do today.
[01:47.32]I ain't just going to run around and let you shoot me with arrows.
[01:51.00]Not like last time.
[01:55.36]Wait, there is snow.
[01:56.48]Oh, there is.
[01:56.94]Yeah, there is.
[01:58.95]There's snow here.
[01:59.51]You're right.
[02:02.59]I don't know.
[02:03.59]That's not enough snow to make snowballs.
[02:08.21]There's 10,000 people here.
[02:09.65]There's not 10,000 people worth of snowballs over there.
[02:14.21]Anyways, the first thing we're gonna do... This is gonna be a fucking shit show.
[02:18.41]Uh, you can guarantee yourself that.
[02:20.03]By the way, welcome to Minecon, right?
[02:22.29]It's Minecraft Day!
[02:24.85]Didn't, uh, mean to do that at all, actually.
[02:27.61]That was just an actual coincidence.
[02:29.69]I had no fucking idea that today was like Minecraft Day.
[02:35.13]Remember, we were supposed to do this like two or three weeks ago.
[02:37.69]This got... Is that your dog?
[02:41.53]Otto!
[02:57.76]He was like, let me in!
[03:01.28]Alright, the first thing we're going to do...
[03:04.29]We're going to kick this off.
[03:06.17]This is going to be a mess.
[03:08.36]The first thing that I need to tell you is if you get in this game, you have 10 lives.
[03:15.10]Once you die 10 times, you're out.
[03:17.52]And you have to re-queue.
[03:19.94]So try not to die.
[03:20.92]It's going to be kind of hard.
[03:23.08]During the course of the next few hours, you're going to see plenty of death.
[03:28.91]Not from each other either.
[03:30.75]We'll see.
[03:33.13]The lag.
[03:33.89]Here comes the lag.
[03:35.73]For so many people in the same spot.
[03:39.99]Holy shit.
[03:40.81]It's handling it, though.
[03:42.44]It's actually handling it.
[03:49.40]Somebody said, nice stream, idiot.
[03:57.05]It's client lag.
[03:58.39]It's because the game was never supposed to allow you to have 5 million people in the same spot.
[04:02.87]But anyway.
[04:05.80]Nice fucking stream, honk honk.
[04:07.36]Alright, anyways, the first thing we're gonna do.
[04:14.30]Let's get the first thing started.
[04:16.10]Everybody in the server.
[04:17.05]By the way, if you want to play.
[04:18.87]It's germaf.tk in the Minecraft client.
[04:21.21]You gotta have Java.
[04:24.96]Java client, not the Windows client, not the Switch client, gotta be the Java client.
[04:33.29]And once you do that, you'll be put into a queue.
[04:38.65]When somebody dies in this server, in this game, they'll be knocked out, you'll take their place.
[04:45.65]So let's get started.
[04:47.57]You get 10 lives.
[04:48.65]Hope you, I wish you all well.
[04:51.60]The first one, we're gonna do a build.
[04:53.00]That's the...
[04:56.10]What was that?
[04:59.29]I didn't do that.
[05:00.73]I didn't do that.
[05:01.45]I mean, I can do that.
[05:07.09]I have this thing.
[05:07.79]Gonna get a good look at this.
[05:13.62]Version 1.8.8 through 1.16.
[05:16.36]You can join any of those.
[05:25.13]Who's driving an ice cream truck in the background?
[05:30.55]I mean, I can do that.
[05:33.92]Can I?
[05:34.22]I think my stick of lightning is broken.
[05:40.42]I can no longer cast lightning.
[05:41.86]Lightning just strikes randomly in the fucking server.
[05:44.26]Alright, so the first thing we're gonna do, we're gonna build.
[05:51.99]Everyone's gonna get blocks in their inventory.
[05:55.44]You're only going to get 10 blocks.
[05:56.76]You all have to make a statue of your king.
[06:02.14]If you place a block, it's there forever.
[06:05.36]You cannot have them be destroyed.
[06:07.02]They cannot be picked back up.
[06:09.36]You want to build me a statue?
[06:10.64]Forget about the lightning.
[06:16.43]Why is it the flag of Italy?
[06:18.99]That's like the Aquafresh logo.
[06:20.51]What are you talking about?
[06:21.23]Italy?
[06:22.15]Italy?
[06:27.02]Alright, are we ready?
[06:27.78]Are we ready to start?
[06:29.46]Are we confirmed that we're ready to begin the build process where you have to build me a statue?
[06:33.51]Work together!
[06:34.23]Please, your king.
[06:37.01]Please, for the love of God.
[06:49.39]Minecraft sucks.
[06:53.46]Don't say that on Minecraft Day.
[07:02.52]You guys ready?
[07:13.23]I'm going to fly away for a second.
[07:15.39]Here comes the build back.
[07:16.91]Here's the thing.
[07:17.37]If you guys make anything that's phallic shaped, it's getting deleted.
[07:21.69]I'll just delete it.
[07:23.01]I'll just delete it.
[07:28.29]Are you supposed to build with all the client lag?
[07:30.03]I don't know.
[07:30.99]Good luck.
[07:34.48]Why is this pre-recorded?
[07:35.56]It's not.
[07:36.80]I'm right here, dude.
[07:42.37]It looks like mafia graphics.
[07:46.01]Yeah, from my perspective, it's going to be laggy.
[07:49.71]But not from other perspectives.
[07:51.72]Don't worry.
[07:53.58]This is like 10 FPS.
[07:54.62]Yeah, it is.
[07:55.56]Because we're capturing it through something else.
[07:58.12]But my perspective doesn't matter.
[07:59.40]We're going to switch.
[07:59.92]Don't worry.
[08:00.26]Don't worry.
[08:03.74]Am I hosting the server?
[08:05.14]No, wait, what?
[08:09.82]I am not hosting the server robot in my like garage.
[08:28.19]Everything is laggy.
[08:29.50]Well, don't worry.
[08:31.22]Once we do the actual events and we let the server rest, it's going to be fine.
[08:46.03]Did I get a better computer?
[08:47.73]Oh, this is running over the course of... I think there's like 10 servers.
[08:53.87]I think there's like 15 servers this is running on right now.
[09:04.88]Travis Scott burger?
[09:05.76]Yeah.
[09:07.34]I haven't had it yet, but... What is it?
[09:11.38]Lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard, mushrooms, onions, ketchup, mustard, and bacon?
[09:15.86]Something like that?
[09:19.07]It's your five.
[09:21.09]My five's not the problem.
[09:31.70]It's running at two frames per second.
[09:35.37]Oh, that's weird.
[09:44.25]Alright, we have a solution.
[09:45.87]We have a solution.
[09:46.75]Hey, look at me.
[09:49.39]Welcome to Technical Difficulties.
[09:52.11]We have to restart the server.
[09:56.15]And it'll be fixed when we restart it.
[09:58.19]We have to cut the player count by like 100 people.
[10:02.12]Alright, let's go.
[10:02.96]Turn it off.
[10:04.76]Put us on the BRB screen.
[10:06.02]We'll be right back.
[10:06.80]Hey, last time we started the stream two hours late.
[10:09.60]I was here on time at 3.01 with technical difficulties.
[10:12.42]Just cut it.
[10:13.12]We'll be back in 10 seconds.
[10:15.73]I was two and a half hours late last FTK.
[10:18.03]It's only been 15 minutes.
[10:19.39]Everybody chill in your seats and relax.
[10:20.93]We'll be back in fucking 10 minutes.
[15:30.43]Hey, dude, is it your VPN?
[15:31.71]No.
[15:33.17]No, that was a joke.
[15:35.15]Hi.
[15:35.41]Hi, everybody.
[15:36.07]Hey.
[15:36.71]How's everybody doing?
[15:40.77]It's me, Laggy.
[15:41.91]Somebody said, and I will give you this.
[15:43.83]I'll give you credit.
[15:45.09]Somebody said, VOD watchers skip 30 minutes.
[15:49.34]Yeah.
[15:49.68]Alright.
[15:50.28]Sure.
[15:50.96]You get it.
[15:51.82]You get that one.
[15:54.44]Hadn't even been 30 minutes yet, though.
[16:00.09]Okay, so I think we are ready to start.
[16:06.08]Keep in mind, the first person view for me, for inventory purposes, is going to be... It's a lower frame rate.
[16:14.96]Everything else should not be.
[16:19.19]You know what?
[16:19.51]Just skip 10 minutes.
[16:20.59]If you do have to evolve right now, just go 10 minutes from now.
[16:23.37]And look, you'll see it.
[16:24.31]You'll be happy.
[16:25.71]You should have listened to that one guy like 25 minutes ago.
[16:28.03]He was right.
[16:31.37]Alright, everybody's gonna get blocks placed in their inventory.
[16:35.90]And you are going to be- look at it, it says- look at how clean this is.
[16:41.56]Jeremiah Windows destruction.
[16:43.24]Everybody has blocks in their inventory.
[16:44.86]I want a statue.
[16:47.72]I want a statue built of me.
[16:49.03]Place those blocks.
[16:49.81]They do not come up when you place them, so don't fuck it up.
[16:54.55]Here, look, I'll get you started.
[16:59.41]Oh shit, I can't, can I pick that back up?
[17:01.93]Look, I'm starting it.
[17:06.49]Watch out for the flowers.
[17:08.19]They can't be, the flowers can't be removed.
[17:13.72]Alright, go.
[17:16.58]You only get 10.
[17:26.57]Why would you go straight up, dude?
[17:36.56]The stream is in 1080p.
[17:37.40]Nice 2008 YouTube video.
[18:05.81]This just looks like a level in Super Mario Sunshine.
[18:16.28]This is not a statue.
[18:17.46]Why does this guy have dirt?
[18:27.88]Unregistered Hypercam.
[18:35.09]No, this is not a statue.
[18:37.92]You guys got it all wrong.
[18:42.34]What?
[18:42.70]Whoa!
[18:43.56]That's actually pretty sick.
[18:44.70]Wow, that's actually kind of good.
[18:45.78]It's got water.
[18:59.10]This is supposed to be a statue of me.
[19:02.68]Not what it feels like to step on a Lego.
[19:08.68]Water.
[19:09.14]I just spit.
[19:09.98]I spit fucking water everywhere right there.
[19:12.97]I spit out so much.
[19:21.61]You're a pause to buffer.
[19:23.85]What?
[19:24.39]What do you mean pause?
[19:29.77]How's that?
[19:30.19]Is that better?
[19:33.02]Oh shit!
[19:33.50]Be careful!
[19:33.95]You can die!
[19:34.71]You can die!
[19:35.35]You can die!
[19:35.95]I can hear the CPU fans from here.
[20:01.91]Yeah, what you're seeing is what happens when hundreds of people are in the same spot.
[20:05.71]It's all client-side lag.
[20:07.66]It will even out once we do the next couple of events.
[20:10.06]Don't worry.
[20:10.46]This is such dog shit.
[20:17.20]Are people just writing fuck?
[20:25.85]I don't know.
[20:26.21]I'm going to be honest with you.
[20:28.95]I don't know why I want so badly to have like a collaborative statue build.
[20:33.11]This is the kind of shit that those little weird guys used to make in Fraggle Rock.
[20:40.44]This is not even like a statue.
[20:43.06]Oh, I want to build a statue.
[20:44.52]That's never gonna fucking happen with like hundreds of people in the same place.
[20:47.53]Ever.
[20:50.53]This is absolutely... Dream fixed?
[20:57.61]Pog, pog.
[20:58.19]We got a pog moment here?
[21:02.65]It's fixed?
[21:03.09]Look at that.
[21:07.11]Alright, keep going.
[21:10.59]Somebody said, hey, dog shit stream.
[21:13.89]Hey.
[21:15.45]Whatever.
[21:16.91]What do you want me to say?
[21:18.91]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[21:20.75]Look at this, we're good.
[21:26.20]Hey, I told you it was going to take 30 minutes.
[21:27.68]I told you, everybody.
[21:29.28]Why did somebody start a fire?
[21:31.76]This is not going to work.
[21:32.54]The build section is going to be fucking stupid.
[21:35.10]Like, it was always going to be stupid.
[21:36.22]Somebody's trying to burn it down now.
[21:40.62]Wait, actually, are you making arms?
[21:42.49]Oh, shit.
[21:43.41]You actually are making arms.
[21:48.83]How do we stop them?
[21:52.69]Well...
[21:58.67]I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
[22:00.45]I did.
[22:00.81]It's burning.
[22:04.89]Dude, come on.
[22:10.43]I don't know, okay, in my dreams last night, I was lying there going like, oh man, they're gonna build, when people work together, like Twitch plays Pokémon, Twitch plays the carnival.
[22:19.68]Make a statue.
[22:20.70]Yeah, and I could see the arms being built and the head and the face.
[22:24.58]They're probably gonna do like a funny like face.
[22:28.69]No.
[22:33.15]This is just a series of lines.
[22:35.27]Up and down.
[22:39.82]And I keep striking it with lightning.
[22:42.12]That's too wishful thinking.
[22:43.36]Yeah.
[22:43.94]Expectation versus reality.
[22:48.50]Like, you...
[22:56.84]I'm going to call this in about two minutes.
[23:01.68]We're going to move on to event number two out of like 30.
[23:03.78]I got to change.
[23:10.01]How do I turn clouds off?
[23:13.35]Alright, clouds off.
[23:14.15]Alright, so let me get a good view of this.
[23:20.47]Nice.
[23:21.66]Yeah, just good.
[23:23.92]Very good.
[23:27.08]It just... That... This is not what I thought.
[23:30.61]This is not what I saw in my dream.
[23:37.17]Can somebody please build, like... Hold on.
[23:39.53]We got something going on up here.
[23:42.15]Good statue of just cobblestone.
[23:46.30]Og?
[23:47.52]Ar?
[23:49.44]This is...
[23:56.49]This is a randomly generated structure.
[23:59.65]Like Google AI from 1998 made this.
[24:03.50]And it was astonishing back in the late 90s.
[24:06.92]Like holy shit, did you see what Google AI 2000 just did?
[24:16.65]I want everyone to be very aware of something.
[24:18.17]This is the warm-up.
[24:19.83]This is the warm-up.
[24:22.43]The first two little events here are a very small warm-up.
[24:26.32]Just to get the server running and everything's going.
[24:28.52]You ain't seen nothing yet.
[24:30.66]Don't you fucking worry.
[24:34.34]Yeah, alright, I think it's time to call the statue here.
[24:36.92]I mean, this is, look, this is terrible.
[24:42.63]Don't you feel like you're gonna drop a coin in the top of this thing?
[24:45.85]And it's gonna be a cool display to see where it goes.
[24:48.90]And then you get the gumball at the end.
[24:55.91]I mean, that's kind of cool, I guess.
[24:57.07]I don't know why people are getting lava.
[25:01.74]Where are people getting lava and water?
[25:04.06]How does somebody already have lava?
[25:05.34]The server's been on for like five seconds.
[25:10.10]Wait, somebody wrote the word ass.
[25:12.12]Where?
[25:12.30]Somebody said cock.
[25:16.27]Alright, I have to turn off the chat for me.
[25:21.65]I gotta turn that off.
[25:23.49]Where is it?
[25:23.95]Turn it off.
[25:27.88]just a bucket alright what's what does it say this is on fire this is pretty cool not a statue but oh it's just pain okay I see so far so good dude you're standing in there can I even hurt people with my stick of absolute lightning alright that's pretty good you guys wanna move on to the second uh second event
[25:57.54]You've made it a great thing here.
[26:07.19]It's done.
[26:07.85]It's done.
[26:08.53]It's over.
[26:08.91]It's done.
[26:09.53]This statue's done.
[26:14.69]Auto smile.
[26:16.50]I guess that kind of is like a face down here.
[26:18.10]It's one of those like Mario mushrooms up there.
[26:31.12]Alright, I would like everybody to follow me.
[26:33.08]Thank you for participating in the build event.
[26:35.84]Why do I think I could go through the fucking front door?
[26:40.32]Thanks for participating in the build event, everybody.
[26:41.94]That was really fun.
[26:44.50]We're going to move on now to the second event here, which is going to be a pog event.
[26:52.07]You can follow me, everybody.
[26:53.93]Everyone in the server, please.
[26:54.85]We're going to go over to the Coliseum and we're going to start the tournament.
[27:00.22]It's going to be a tournament between people in here.
[27:03.82]Heading over to the Coliseum.
[27:05.66]It's a PogChamp event.
[27:06.50]You're free to say PogChamp.
[27:10.18]If you want to.
[27:15.77]Follow me to the Coliseum.
[27:20.39]What's going on?
[27:20.75]Otto, you want to go outside?
[27:23.49]He's like, let me in, let me out, let me in, let me out.
[27:26.85]Take a look at this.
[27:29.43]Two are going to enter.
[27:30.49]One at a time.
[27:33.81]You will fight to the death.
[27:34.71]Those of you that remain will be tiered based on how many people you've killed.
[27:44.12]And don't even try to go down here because you can't.
[27:48.70]You can.
[27:49.64]You can't.
[27:50.16]You cannot.
[27:50.88]There you go.
[27:52.34]Don't even try it because you can't.
[27:57.90]I really wonder how this is gonna play out I don't think this is gonna play out the way that we think it is So to enter why wait people can just jump up you can't go in though good luck It's just a glass ceiling No the tournaments not just everybody go in here and just start killing each other that's not the tournament
[28:23.12]He's training Psycho- Wait, somebody's dead!
[28:25.54]Wait, what?
[28:28.40]No, it's the tournament!
[28:30.44]Don't kill each other!
[28:37.27]Why are people on fire?
[28:42.07]This is the tournament.
[28:43.21]If you die ten times, by the way, you're fucking out of here.
[28:46.19]I need to make that very clear.
[28:51.45]If you type slash duel, you are going to be queued up to be participating down there.
[28:56.54]It looks like we got somebody already there.
[28:58.32]Who's there?
[28:58.74]I can't even see their name.
[29:06.55]Somebody queue up and fight this guy.
[29:11.09]Is he fighting anybody?
[29:11.91]Is somebody else even down there?
[29:17.81]Dick Dashley Richard versus who?
[29:21.89]Wait, why are we all like flying blocks?
[29:27.09]Who is he fighting?
[29:27.89]There's no one.
[29:28.55]Oh, wait, here we go.
[29:29.15]Yep.
[29:29.37]Okay, okay, okay.
[29:29.91]Here we go.
[29:30.23]Let's go.
[29:30.55]Come on, Dick Dastardly Richard versus 847.
[29:33.47]I don't know what the fuck that number is.
[29:45.37]Are they fighting?
[29:45.97]Alright, you guys get to fight.
[29:50.01]Fight to the death.
[29:50.59]Let's go.
[29:52.80]I guess what if they just don't fight?
[29:57.18]This guy has a sword.
[30:05.82]Well, why did you queue up for the duel if you didn't have anything to fight with?
[30:14.03]I think he's gonna win.
[30:14.71]Does this guy have armor too?
[30:16.79]Why does this guy have armor?
[30:21.09]Who's he fighting at?
[30:26.02]Why is he swinging at us?
[30:31.68]He thought he was going to be supplied.
[30:33.38]Oh, wait, there's people spawning.
[30:35.44]Where did this guy come from?
[30:36.34]Can't join, can't join.
[30:39.80]Well, the server's probably full right now.
[30:47.39]No one can connect to the server?
[30:51.11]It's probably because everyone's, it's full, right?
[30:58.15]Why are we all ghosts?
[31:03.71]Wait, hold on.
[31:04.31]Peter Griffin just saved the stream because he showed up.
[31:06.01]People being kicked?
[31:14.87]Why are we all floating around as ghosts?
[31:22.13]Hold on.
[31:22.39]I'll tell him to go outside.
[31:23.19]One sec.
[31:24.81]Come here.
[31:40.58]So wait, the server's down?
[31:48.24]Connection lost.
[31:49.30]Oh shit, the whole thing is down.
[31:52.04]Wait, is it actual next duel?
[31:59.15]This is the most interesting thing I've ever seen.
[32:03.53]Why is everybody's heads just floating around as ghosts?
[32:11.54]I don't remember seeing this before.
[32:12.92]This is insane.
[32:21.60]It's just spectator mode.
[32:22.94]Oh, okay.
[32:38.65]Oh, I'm getting something in my ear.
[32:51.03]Alright, so there's too many people in spectator mode, which is crashing the whole client.
[32:55.43]Alright.
[32:56.77]Let's just move on to the main event.
[32:58.43]No more stalling.
[32:59.61]Let's move on to the main event.
[33:01.61]Let's do the main event.
[33:03.85]The main event is going to take like three hours.
[33:06.52]And none of this shit will happen in the main event.
[33:08.58]I just wanted to give some padding.
[33:09.78]There was supposed to be a little tournament, but there's 50 trillion people here.
[33:18.28]Worse than Bugleberry.
[33:19.58]Yeah, that's alright.
[33:20.91]Yeah.
[33:22.35]Yeah, it is.
[33:23.89]It's worse, but that's fine.
[33:33.26]We wanted a fight.
[37:03.18]Hello.
[37:04.82]Hi.
[37:06.51]Welcome back.
[37:10.31]Okay, if a stream is the worst stream of 2020, guaranteed.
[37:14.75]We can remove it from the list, right?
[37:15.97]Like, everything else is an honorable mention at this point, right?
[37:21.60]Like, this could just sit as, like, the worst stream of 2020.
[37:25.50]And then, you know, we can vote on another one.
[37:29.38]That's fair, right?
[37:30.44]That's fair.
[37:33.46]That's fair, right?
[37:36.90]We all agree, alright?
[37:38.16]I agree.
[37:38.56]We all agree.
[37:41.84]So what's the point of having to vote for it?
[37:43.60]It's already stamped and thrown out.
[37:45.74]Alright, here we go.
[37:47.34]We are going to move on.
[37:48.47]We're going to try to do the actual main event of this stream.
[37:55.11]Oh!
[37:58.19]No!
[37:59.75]No!
[38:01.83]It's dead.
[38:04.12]I'm going to put in Ratatouille quick.
[38:17.87]Should I open up the Ratatouille level?
[38:24.37]I can't.
[38:25.59]I'm not even streaming.
[38:27.23]Did you believe that?
[38:29.12]Emergency Ratatouille stream incoming.
[38:46.70]Imagine the FTK stream becomes emergency Ratatouille stream.
[38:51.30]Holy shit, that might be the most ridiculous thing ever.
[38:53.65]Alright, we're gonna try this again.
[38:59.95]There's so much cool shit in this.
[39:02.23]There's so much cool shit in this.
[39:04.50]You have no idea, guys.
[39:06.02]You gotta see it, alright?
[39:07.22]We just have to see it.
[39:08.48]It's fucking awesome.
[39:09.66]Alright, we just gotta get there.
[39:16.26]Do another Diablo II playthrough?
[39:17.84]Okay.
[39:18.90]Eh, maybe.
[39:25.08]Alright, I'm in!
[39:27.08]Are we good to go?
[39:28.08]Are we good to try?
[39:28.90]Go play Genshin Impact.
[39:41.81]I don't even know what that is.
[39:43.51]But... Maybe.
[39:54.88]You just said two words back to back.
[39:56.62]I don't even know what they were.
[39:59.67]You said Genshin and then Impact.
[40:06.84]Please do.
[40:07.32]Please do.
[40:07.64]I don't even know what it is.
[40:21.52]It's a gotcha game?
[40:23.90]I don't know.
[40:24.20]I don't know.
[40:24.58]Did somebody have this up?
[40:25.98]Did your skin say stream sucks?
[40:28.50]Oh, no.
[40:28.90]Jerma sucks.
[40:29.72]Okay.
[40:35.31]Alright.
[40:35.59]We're going to try to do this.
[40:36.63]We're going to try to start this.
[40:39.07]Everybody pretend to be excited.
[40:41.59]Everybody pretend to be floored by this coming up.
[40:44.45]Alright?
[40:46.61]You ready?
[40:46.97]We're going to act.
[40:48.19]This is acting class.
[40:49.10]One on one.
[40:51.58]Oh, what have I?
[40:52.26]There's a dragon!
[40:53.70]Quick to the battlements!
[40:55.88]Get yourselves a bow and arrow and some kind of... We're being attacked!
[40:59.94]The tournament has been interrupted by a dragon!
[41:04.78]Hurry to the armaments!
[41:08.45]My inventory is full of dog shit!
[41:11.27]I don't want any of this stuff!
[41:12.63]I need a bow and arrow!
[41:18.75]Grab all you can!
[41:26.50]Why do I have apples in my fucking- I don't want- I have flowers and apples and shit.
[41:32.76]People throwing snowballs.
[41:36.40]This is the Argent Tournament.
[41:38.56]Wow reference.
[41:41.27]Shut up!
[41:42.37]This is a lot of time.
[41:45.69]Alright, let's go.
[41:47.39]I got my bow and arrow.
[41:49.75]Wait, I need arrows.
[41:50.63]I actually need an arrow.
[41:52.49]You only need one arrow, it's a magical bow.
[42:10.64]Oh shit, we just killed like five people.
[42:12.90]Alright, we did it.
[42:14.32]Victory.
[42:16.14]The dragon has gone into hiding.
[42:17.80]Would you look at that?
[42:18.66]What a surprise that would have been if it happened in the middle of a fucking tournament.
[42:25.20]Holy shit, a lot of people died.
[42:32.04]Look at all this stuff on the ground.
[42:34.36]Jesus Christ.
[42:35.28]Alright, here we go.
[42:38.66]Let's go back to the town.
[42:39.80]What do you say?
[42:43.12]Let's go back to the town.
[42:44.08]Let's get this shit figured out.
[42:48.69]That dragon just attacked the town.
[42:50.53]Turn him into a... I sense something strange.
[42:59.25]I don't know about any of you guys, but I sense something strange happening in the air.
[43:07.54]Real tragedy?
[43:08.36]What?
[43:08.52]Alright, let's head back.
[43:15.63]Anybody else sense something?
[43:17.13]Especially, potentially, somebody on the production staff might sense where direction I should be heading.
[43:28.26]I don't know where it is.
[43:29.76]Where is it?
[43:30.76]Where is it?
[43:31.52]Where is it?
[43:32.96]Where is it?
[43:36.11]Where's the thing that I have to touch?
[43:47.47]Oh, my dream.
[43:48.97]I was like sleeping going, oh, wow.
[43:51.11]The dragon attacks and there's a statue and wow.
[43:56.45]Hey, where's this thing that I have to touch, guy on production staff?
[43:59.90]Help me.
[44:05.08]That didn't happen in my dream last night for this game.
[44:15.32]Where actually is it, though?
[44:18.73]This is... Okay, when you're like a little kid, and you... In your mind, you have this elaborate thing play out.
[44:25.71]The way that you're talking... Oh, wait!
[44:26.81]Hold on!
[44:27.59]What's that?
[44:29.69]Hey, fellas!
[44:30.93]Fellas, I found it!
[44:32.23]What is it over...
[44:38.46]Hey fellas, I found it.
[44:42.18]What's this over here?
[44:43.40]There's a cave system over here.
[44:54.33]Look out, the dragon escaped.
[45:00.07]Come back to the Coliseum and check it out.
[45:04.85]Something happened here.
[45:06.58]Why is nobody listening to me?
[45:07.62]I'm just the only person over here.
[45:11.24]I'm just playing it alone.
[45:15.50]Is anybody listening?
[45:24.65]Ow.
[45:25.59]Ow.
[45:26.27]Ow, my chest.
[45:27.21]That's so fucking sad, but funny at the same time.
[45:30.09]No one's listening to me.
[45:33.03]Oh.
[45:42.46]We are here for Steve.
[45:48.22]I see people.
[45:48.92]I see people.
[45:49.94]Wait, I gotta go in.
[45:50.88]I want to experience this too.
[45:52.20]I want to see this.
[45:53.10]I'm on fucking fire.
[45:54.93]Why am I on fire?
[45:56.89]How do I put myself out?
[45:58.07]I'm on fire.
[45:58.59]How do I put myself out?
[45:59.13]I'm on fire.
[45:59.51]Alright, everybody, quick!
[46:10.97]Into the portal!
[46:14.00]Okay, what I was gonna say is, you know when you're like a little kid, and you, inside of your head, when you're like 10, 11, 12 years old, and you just see and hear this elaborate thing that you're making up.
[46:25.76]Like, you have a dragon flying by in your head, and you're fighting with a sword outside, it's like recess or whatever, and it's like real life out there.
[46:35.46]That's how I felt it was gonna be, but, like, in reality, when, like, the teachers look out the window to recess, they see, like, two, like, little shits just, like, moving around in circles, going, like, DRAGON!
[46:45.90]LOOK OUT FOR THE DRAGON!
[46:47.54]AHHHHH!
[46:50.20]But in their head, it's like a fucking movie.
[46:52.21]That's how I felt today.
[46:57.61]Uh, anyways, welcome.
[46:59.17]Uh, we're in some kind of dungeon right now.
[47:00.93]I think we need to find our way out of this fucking dungeon.
[47:08.82]We need to go find the king's sword.
[47:10.78]I just can't even.
[47:14.36]We're going to RP right now.
[47:16.07]Find the king's sword at recess.
[47:22.23]Everybody in.
[47:26.65]You got to get in one at a time.
[47:28.29]Not too many people go in the hot tub.
[47:31.62]Be careful.
[47:32.06]You can die in here.
[47:32.90]This actually is dangerous in here.
[47:34.14]Be careful.
[47:39.02]We gotta make our way and find the king sword.
[47:43.30]Careful, careful!
[47:45.32]What the hell?
[47:45.84]What the hell is that?
[47:49.26]Alright, there's like a super creeper over here.
[47:55.09]Kill it!
[47:58.03]It's like Harry Potter.
[47:59.59]It's the creeper king.
[48:01.67]Oh shit, fuck that.
[48:07.03]Is this the new update?
[48:08.37]No.
[48:08.83]No, it's not.
[48:10.21]No, it's not.
[48:10.87]This is Minecraft 1.8.9.
[48:11.55]Someone feed in the pool.
[48:21.34]Kill this thing.
[48:24.00]Can we hurt this thing?
[48:29.23]He's kind of just looking at people.
[48:30.51]Is he going to explode?
[48:39.31]Pool's closed.
[48:40.43]No, the pool's open.
[48:41.13]You just gotta go in it.
[48:48.25]Oh, no, I see what's happening.
[48:49.09]People are killing each other.
[48:50.13]This guy has a... Don't fight each other.
[48:57.44]Fight the Creeper King.
[48:59.96]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[49:01.34]We're supposed to be working together.
[49:09.06]Did anybody even hurt him?
[49:10.68]Is he just an NPC for fun?
[49:17.54]I think he's invincible.
[49:18.40]Do we need to do anything in particular?
[49:20.94]Do we need to, like, dump, like, water on him or something?
[49:23.22]People are trying to leave.
[49:23.96]I think we have to kill this thing, but how do we kill it?
[49:29.96]Oh, shit, he's on fire.
[49:30.64]Wait, wait, wait.
[49:30.98]Shoot him with arrows.
[49:37.80]I think I just headshot somebody and killed them.
[49:40.84]Whoa.
[49:41.34]What was that?
[49:43.29]What was that?
[49:44.57]I hear explosions now.
[49:51.09]Where are the explosions?
[50:03.36]I can't even tell if we're hurting them.
[50:08.11]This guy just lives here.
[50:09.10]We're just like fucking up his whole house.
[50:17.40]I think there's explosions too.
[50:24.11]Oh, I think we have to hit the bottom part.
[50:26.99]Hit the bottom part?
[50:27.83]Come on.
[50:46.53]Where is he?
[50:47.29]He kind of blends in with people that have diamond armor on.
[50:49.99]Wait, there's two of them.
[50:53.05]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[50:54.35]There are two of these guys?
[50:56.73]Oh, this guy's bigger.
[50:59.28]Oh, shit.
[51:01.04]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[51:08.78]Oh, fuck.
[51:09.20]Alright, I'm going this way.
[51:09.96]I can't tell who's like a friend or a foe.
[51:28.60]I literally just headshot somebody and killed them.
[51:34.56]How much health does he have?
[51:38.91]RDM.
[51:41.47]There's so many arrows everywhere too.
[51:44.69]This is fucking ridiculous.
[51:52.10]Why am I throwing snowballs at him?
[51:53.34]That's not gonna work.
[52:00.95]Is he dead?
[52:03.19]I'm gonna die in a second.
[52:08.03]I'm dead.
[52:09.23]Oh shit.
[52:09.81]Why do I have ten lives?
[52:10.77]I'm supposed to have a thousand.
[52:14.49]Oh my fucking god.
[52:15.35]There's stuff all over the floor.
[52:17.08]I don't even know what I picked up.
[52:18.48]What happened?
[52:19.24]I'm naked.
[52:25.32]Do I still...
[52:30.49]Oh shit.
[52:31.95]Is he spawn- No!
[52:34.53]I don't- Nine lives.
[52:35.81]That's not- I'm flying around.
[52:39.49]Someone- Oh shit!
[52:42.27]Someone has my lightning stick!
[52:45.45]Oh fuck, they do!
[52:51.39]Somebody has the stick!
[52:56.42]That's why I'm dying!
[52:57.72]That's what the lightning strikes are!
[53:02.65]What are you doing?
[53:04.62]I can't.
[53:05.50]I can't, man.
[53:08.10]Alright, hold on.
[53:08.70]I died.
[53:14.32]I can turn on god mode, but I don't think I need it right now.
[53:18.01]How much health does he have left?
[53:42.25]Somebody said, somebody, one of the family people has their sound way up and it's blowing out of his throat.
[53:50.29]We gotta kill this motherfucker.
[53:54.00]How do we kill this guy?
[53:56.88]Why is there an Enderman in here?
[53:58.98]Does anybody have a weapon I can borrow?
[54:06.65]Why do I not have a fucking weapon?
[54:15.03]Do it louder, please.
[54:17.69]Is there audio to turn down?
[54:18.71]There we go.
[54:26.07]Do we know how much health this guy has?
[54:27.15]I feel like we're playing Destiny.
[54:36.54]Destiny 3.
[54:55.12]I'm killing this motherfucker right now.
[54:56.70]How do I do it?
[55:03.12]I can turn on- I can turn on- I'm in god mode?
[55:05.24]Alright.
[55:10.00]Yeah, let's kill this motherfucker.
[55:11.54]Oh, I'm gonna hit him once.
[55:15.54]Kill him!
[55:17.76]Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[55:21.08]I can't PvP here.
[55:30.42]Final phase?
[55:31.32]I can't even hurt him.
[55:36.03]Fix the queue?
[55:36.85]Is the queue server fucked up?
[55:49.91]Yes, it is.
[55:53.02]They're saying the queue server is fucked up.
[55:56.82]Game server is alright.
[56:03.60]You can TP to people?
[56:04.74]You can.
[56:05.06]Alright, how do we instantly kill this guy?
[56:16.41]How do we kill this thing?
[56:17.75]We're just like bullying this fucking creeper.
[56:19.77]Jerma, just swallow your pride and play Ratatouille.
[56:33.25]Look it works.
[56:34.35]We're in well.
[56:35.49]I'm staying How did everybody get all this diamond armor?
[56:46.66]Alright, let's move he's dead He's been killed
[57:02.55]Uh, we gotta go through this, through here?
[57:05.97]I'd kill all.
[57:11.85]Where's, where's the next room?
[57:22.90]Oh, it's all the way back here?
[57:26.46]Am I looking the right way?
[57:27.12]I actually can't believe this many people are in here right now.
[57:35.34]So, all the way to the back wall here.
[57:36.40]Oh, here we go.
[57:45.50]Alright, follow me next row.
[57:47.46]We gotta find that sword.
[57:53.79]Wait, easy, easy, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, don't go so fast.
[58:08.93]I can't see anything.
[58:10.07]There's too many people.
[58:13.48]It's a giant maze.
[58:15.12]There's too many people in here.
[58:17.30]There's too many.
[58:18.36]I'm fucking claustrophobic right now.
[58:26.99]You can't break it.
[58:27.73]Somebody's gotta find the exit.
[58:29.34]It's a maze.
[58:39.28]Alright, split up, split up.
[58:40.58]Don't all go the same way.
[58:41.74]We have to split up.
[58:43.10]Is there a fucking... Is there an Enderman in here too?
[58:49.36]Alright, split up, split up.
[58:52.68]We gotta find the exit.
[58:53.68]Does somebody have an Enderman skin?
[59:01.17]Alright, good.
[59:04.79]Progress, progress, progress.
[59:15.69]I see nameplates everywhere.
[59:16.91]Good.
[59:17.17]Spread out.
[59:17.79]Spread as far out as you can.
[59:31.45]That way?
[59:31.81]No?
[59:31.97]Let's go this way.
[59:37.51]Why am I seeing omega lulls right now?
[59:39.24]Why is everybody laughing?
[59:45.45]I see Omega Lull, Omega Lull, Omega Lull, Omega Lull.
[59:48.33]Really?
[59:48.59]You put a maze in here?
[59:49.55]You're insane.
[59:50.19]I think there's like a couple.
[59:54.11]Good luck!
[59:54.57]Yeah, it's not nothing.
[59:57.65]This is some fucking hard shit here.
[60:04.27]Alright, we have to be getting close to the end.
[60:06.59]I hear the Enderman.
[60:07.43]It's huge!
[60:17.48]I feel like we're making really good progress.
[60:29.41]I stream Hong Kong.
[60:30.51]Yeah, alright.
[60:31.17]I watched Beetlejuice 2.
[60:32.03]It was a funny movie.
[60:36.83]Oh, wait.
[60:37.33]There's a bottleneck here.
[60:38.76]I don't have time.
[60:44.13]Progress towards what?
[60:44.93]Towards the exit.
[60:45.47]We're gonna go through the dungeon.
[60:55.88]How far... How much progress have we made?
[60:58.46]Anybody on production want to tell me?
[61:04.98]I'm curious.
[61:05.78]I wonder.
[61:10.28]Black Friday POV.
[61:13.44]Get in there, I gotta get a new Wii.
[61:16.57]How far are we?
[61:23.81]Oh, we're almost halfway there.
[61:31.75]I told you, splitting up was a good idea.
[61:40.07]Oh, I just turned around.
[61:41.19]I got turned around.
[61:43.11]Wait, am I going the wrong way?
[61:43.89]Oh, shit.
[61:45.91]Wait, where... I was going the right way, but then I got turned around.
[61:51.23]I have no idea.
[61:53.37]Oh, stop whispering me that shit.
[61:54.99]Alright, time that... Ban that person!
[62:04.80]The queue server limit's 400 right now.
[62:07.46]Should be a lot more than that.
[62:10.35]Is this the wrong way?
[62:12.35]Oh, shit.
[62:13.01]Hold on.
[62:13.51]Guys, we're going the wrong way.
[62:14.29]Wrong way.
[62:14.67]Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[62:15.24]Turn around.
[62:21.18]Yeah, if you're not in the maze, by the way, guys, if you're not in this current room, if you type slash die, you're gonna lose a life, but you will end up at the beginning of the maze.
[62:31.57]So, if you're all the way back, you're like, oh, shit, I can't fucking go anywhere.
[62:35.37]You do slash die.
[62:39.63]You will end up at the beginning.
[62:40.83]Of the maze.
[62:44.07]Shit.
[62:44.41]I- alright, I gotta pay attention.
[62:47.49]Am I going the- which- this- ah, people are walking forward, backwards.
[62:52.12]Oh, fuck.
[62:52.66]Is anybody- is anybody close?
[63:02.14]Once somebody beats it, we all win.
[63:09.86]This way, this way, this way.
[63:10.56]Yep, yep, yep, go, go, go, go, go.
[63:20.17]I'm so close.
[63:20.81]Keep going.
[63:21.19]Yeah, yeah.
[63:24.29]Shit!
[63:24.59]I'm turning chat off.
[63:28.95]Like fucking WALL-E.
[63:29.99]Alright, I gotta turn this off.
[63:36.26]Somebody said that.
[63:37.48]Why did I read that shit?
[63:40.19]God damn it.
[63:40.75]Alright, wrong way, wrong way, wrong way.
[63:42.23]Turn around.
[63:48.83]I feel like we're just ants.
[63:49.93]Isn't this how ants work?
[63:52.31]One ant picks a direction and lays down like ant fluid and all the other ants follow the ant fluid?
[63:57.36]Who's the lead ant right now?
[63:58.58]Somebody has to be lead ant.
[63:59.50]Alright, why don't you take over lead ant?
[64:02.94]It's not going to be me.
[64:03.92]Somebody take over.
[64:04.82]I'm going to bless one of you.
[64:08.50]Alright, uh... I can't see.
[64:11.16]About... Alright, Scales.
[64:15.30]Scales7744.
[64:18.25]That's the new lead ant.
[64:20.13]Everybody follow him.
[64:21.23]He's got like a green t-shirt and jeans on.
[64:23.37]Follow the guy with the green shirt on.
[64:29.94]You know where you're going?
[64:39.56]Is somebody there?
[64:40.22]Did somebody do it?
[64:46.39]Oh, they- somebody got- somebody got really close and then they- they turned around and got fucked up.
[64:52.35]Shit!
[64:52.83]Oh my god.
[64:53.53]Alright, this way.
[64:58.93]I don't even know if I'm going the right direction or not.
[65:01.27]I think we just wanna circle.
[65:06.37]Oh my god, okay.
[65:13.15]Over here.
[65:14.27]And then right.
[65:17.32]Yup, right here.
[65:17.80]Okay.
[65:20.82]And then... And then... This way.
[65:24.40]And then left.
[65:26.18]Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.
[65:27.26]Follow Tingey.
[65:27.82]Tingey's got it.
[65:28.34]Tingey's got it.
[65:38.28]Welcome to... By the way, welcome to Minecraft Day, everybody.
[65:40.54]Didn't know that was today.
[65:46.74]Minecon 2020!
[65:56.46]Oh no, I just got... I just got word in my ear, guys, that we are going the 100% wrong direction.
[66:03.56]We turned around and went the wrong way.
[66:05.54]We're running backwards now.
[66:09.10]Uh, not going the right way.
[66:12.10]At all.
[66:16.71]Back this way.
[66:17.43]Alright, I'm gonna give this ten more minutes, five more minutes before I start taking walls down.
[66:20.79]Holy shit, that guy's huge!
[66:34.21]What happened to the one guy that was almost done?
[66:35.67]Is he, is he still getting close?
[66:51.29]Is everybody just hopelessly lost?
[66:52.89]This is just a way to keep us busy?
[67:00.17]Somebody said career ending stream.
[67:04.36]Oh, whatever.
[67:05.42]That was a good run.
[67:17.64]Sir, you are fired.
[67:19.89]Eh, it's alright.
[67:20.47]It was pretty good.
[67:21.09]It was pretty fun.
[67:26.49]He's talking about me.
[67:27.33]Alright, I'm taking walls down.
[67:32.07]I'm taking walls down.
[67:32.73]I want to go to the next room.
[67:33.63]I don't want to do this anymore.
[67:34.41]I want to go to the next room.
[67:35.44]How do I do this?
[67:43.92]It's too hard.
[67:45.42]I don't know where we're going.
[67:46.60]Nobody knows where they're going.
[67:57.37]Okay, so... I'm just gonna start taking walls down.
[68:00.77]I don't have a pickaxe.
[68:06.15]What?
[68:07.07]Somebody give me- I need a pickaxe.
[68:09.57]Somebody give- Somebody give me a pickaxe?
[68:19.09]I can't- I can't break walls.
[68:22.98]Fuck.
[68:23.72]Can I actually not cheat?
[68:30.33]Oh shit, alright, I got it, guys, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[68:33.07]Hopefully I'm facing the right direction.
[68:37.33]Oh shit, I fell through the world!
[68:40.55]Oh shit!
[68:45.82]No!
[68:46.54]Please tell me you can see this!
[68:48.92]I'm killing everybody!
[68:52.66]I'm sorry!
[68:54.62]I'm sorry!
[69:20.70]I'm sorry, I tried.
[69:22.53]I tried.
[69:22.97]I killed like 10 people.
[69:24.37]20 people at least just died.
[69:26.49]Alright, don't look at the ground and hit the ground.
[69:37.00]Alright, wait, I made it to the end of the maze!
[69:39.69]I made it to the end of the maze, guys.
[69:40.97]I did it!
[69:46.11]Pog!
[69:48.17]Look!
[69:54.49]Oh shit, hold on, I gotta change this.
[69:59.26]Alright, come on in.
[69:59.86]Look where I am.
[70:01.68]Hey, I made it to the end of the maze, guys.
[70:03.74]Is anybody even close?
[70:08.96]Nobody's even remotely close.
[70:10.80]Why is there somebody on top?
[70:14.28]Alright, if you hit slash die, you're going to come to me.
[70:20.51]Put it on easy mode.
[70:23.23]Yeah, I kind of did, didn't I?
[70:29.54]What's the next room?
[70:30.98]There's a bear in here.
[70:31.78]Oh, no, that's a
[70:35.67]Alright, uh... Careful, careful, careful, careful, careful.
[70:39.27]This is... This is a jumping map.
[70:48.76]The queue thinks that there's four... Well, there is only 400 people in the server.
[70:52.26]How the queue system works is it pulls you in when somebody else here dies.
[70:56.48]You'll be in the queue until somebody here is gone.
[70:58.20]At least that's how it's kind of supposed to work.
[71:03.33]Oh, there goes somebody.
[71:04.25]Okay.
[71:04.90]Okay, this is a jump map.
[71:05.86]Be careful.
[71:12.30]Let us out.
[71:12.94]There's only two.
[71:15.34]Oh, the server.
[71:15.90]Okay, right.
[71:16.54]The server thinks there's 400 people.
[71:19.10]I see.
[71:19.40]I see what you're saying.
[71:22.73]So the server, the queue server still thinks there's 400 people.
[71:26.23]So it's booting people because it thinks there's supposed to be 400 in here.
[71:30.57]But there's only 250 from the kind of extreme thing we had to do at the very beginning of the stream.
[71:37.43]Alright, let me turn this off.
[71:47.78]How are you guys even making these jumps in the first place?
[71:53.28]I can't even see to make the first jump.
[71:58.74]Somebody's already doing very well.
[72:03.50]How can you even see this first jump?
[72:05.98]I...
[72:15.91]Oh, hold on.
[72:16.60]People are falling, but not dying.
[72:20.56]You can climb back up.
[72:24.48]Okay, this guy is seriously beating the whole thing.
[72:28.45]How are you this good at this?
[72:30.19]Half of us can't even get past the first jump.
[72:33.97]Are you fucking kidding me?
[72:34.89]Did this guy beat it already?
[72:44.77]Wow!
[72:45.37]Look at this guy go!
[72:53.29]Did he just beat it?
[72:53.89]He can just sit here and taunt us.
[73:05.95]Hold on.
[73:06.69]I want to get a good view of this.
[73:08.71]How do I do that?
[73:12.61]I'm actually really surprised that he was able to do that.
[73:24.20]He's the real king.
[73:28.00]Yeah, well, no, I'm the real king.
[73:29.60]But he can be the one that's on camera because he's doing something interesting instead of just falling off the same first jump.
[73:41.73]You can tell where the bottleneck is because it's where every single person is here.
[73:47.85]There's a major bottleneck at this jump here.
[73:57.52]people's heads.
[73:58.10]Alright, you gotta jump to get a good view.
[74:02.62]I'm afraid if I walk forward, I'm gonna die.
[74:04.72]Yep.
[74:05.38]Okay.
[74:10.66]I'm good.
[74:17.69]He could just sit here and taunt us.
[74:24.51]What's that command to make it so you can't see anybody but you?
[74:36.88]Oh, did that work?
[74:37.82]Slash hide.
[74:38.64]Oh, one word.
[74:40.44]Oh, shit.
[74:40.82]This is way easier.
[74:41.64]I can actually see what the hell I'm doing.
[74:44.82]Oh, this is awesome.
[74:45.70]This is cool.
[74:50.44]Just cut away from me.
[74:51.30]Cut away from me.
[74:51.84]Cut away from me.
[74:52.34]Cut away from me.
[74:52.78]I don't want anyone to see anything that I'm doing.
[74:58.07]Fucking give me a break.
[75:05.21]How do you get that first one there?
[75:09.53]People are making pretty good progress though.
[75:10.89]I got it, I got it, I'm good, I'm good.
[75:21.88]Got it.
[75:26.86]Are they throwing shit at me?
[75:28.47]Alright, I'm good here.
[75:33.89]There's a lava portion.
[75:35.01]How many people are at the lava portion?
[75:41.39]Oh, fuck.
[75:41.91]It's okay.
[75:42.55]It's alright.
[75:43.07]I'm good.
[75:47.88]No.
[75:48.82]What happened?
[75:51.40]He didn't make it in the water?
[75:52.42]He didn't make it?
[75:53.04]I don't know.
[75:57.00]I'm trying to win.
[75:57.80]I don't even know.
[75:58.70]I can't see what you guys are looking at.
[75:59.82]I can try to jump.
[76:17.74]This looks right.
[76:19.86]Oh, shit.
[76:20.32]How do I jump on this?
[76:20.98]Wait, what?
[76:28.70]Oh, he fell?
[76:29.67]He fell at the cactus.
[76:31.31]No!
[76:35.75]Really?
[76:36.11]That's too bad.
[76:36.83]I don't understand this jump here.
[76:49.86]I kind of want to turn... Okay, I'm going to turn my ship back on because I can't tell what to do here.
[76:53.52]Hide all, right?
[77:03.53]So how do you jump around this?
[77:18.73]Oh, you have to go down!
[77:19.65]Oh shit, okay.
[77:23.76]What?!
[77:24.10]No you don't!
[77:27.80]Hold this- you have to grab the ladder.
[77:29.04]Shit, okay, I wasn't paying attention to that.
[77:41.67]Oh my fucking god, whatever.
[77:49.71]These are all- these are all the rejects down here?
[77:51.58]Aww.
[77:53.82]Dammit.
[77:56.18]You didn't sprint?
[77:57.28]Oh.
[78:04.09]Somebody said they just got banned.
[78:06.01]Well, what did you do?
[78:21.21]Is there any... He's going to the end?
[78:26.63]Is there any way we can make the server queue system be actually 250 and not 400?
[78:32.63]Because what's happening is it's getting to... Somebody's going to be being allowed to be let in, but it's immediately booting them because the server thinks that there's supposed to be 400 slots.
[78:41.15]I don't know if they can look into that somehow.
[78:48.06]Did it?
[78:51.41]I actually did it!
[78:54.31]Who did it?
[78:54.67]Which one?
[78:57.29]They deserve a gold helmet for that.
[78:58.53]Peasant.
[79:02.53]LNV... LNV-42.
[79:07.29]Where are you?
[79:10.07]This is what you get for completing the mission.
[79:13.94]LNV-42.
[79:16.86]Yeah, they... TP me to LNV-42.
[79:22.51]Oh, are they right behind me?
[79:27.55]Oh, there you are.
[79:28.53]Here, take this gold helmet.
[79:29.71]You deserve it.
[79:30.15]Did you get it?
[79:34.85]Nice job.
[79:40.14]Congratulations.
[79:40.96]You completed the jumping map.
[79:43.88]Somebody has two lives left.
[79:45.00]Well, be careful.
[79:45.66]Alright, let's keep going.
[79:49.84]Let's continue.
[79:55.09]Follow me.
[80:02.68]Is this a maze?
[80:03.42]Wait, is this just a long... Remember, if you have lives remaining, hit slash die and you will start at the beginning.
[80:09.65]This is a maze again.
[80:10.23]Yeah, this is a maze.
[80:12.59]This one looks easier though.
[80:14.65]Take that though.
[80:15.25]Alright, I mean, why wouldn't I?
[80:25.54]Don't open.
[80:26.58]Why not?
[80:26.84]I can do hide all again.
[80:38.71]Yeah, those of you that can... You guys listening for the... On the server side of stuff.
[80:44.79]Can somebody look into the whole queue thing?
[80:46.30]Because I think people are actually getting just booted for no... Just by being brought in.
[80:49.48]Okay, cool.
[80:56.89]I don't want to hide all players though, because then I can't cheat and follow somebody.
[80:59.31]Is it... Redstone?
[81:25.80]Why are people saying, holy shit?
[81:30.12]This is an algorithm maze?
[81:34.29]Somebody said this is going to take hours?
[81:35.85]No, the other one took like 10 minutes for someone to get to the end.
[81:54.21]What do the pressure plates do?
[81:55.61]I... What do... I don't know.
[81:57.15]What do they do?
[82:00.02]I see nametags.
[82:07.98]Shit.
[82:08.24]We were already here.
[82:08.86]This is wrong.
[82:11.23]I remember this is the diamond.
[82:12.09]That's where I got the diamond.
[82:18.49]Shit.
[82:19.99]Uhhh...
[82:23.93]This way?
[82:24.41]Everyone wants to get TP'd to the end of the parkour course, say, in chat.
[82:36.08]Well, if you wanna- Wait, why can I see you?
[82:40.30]Wait, did I beat it?
[82:40.88]Oh no, shit, this is the beginning of the level.
[82:44.83]This is the very beginning of the game.
[82:47.05]Great.
[82:48.01]I went all the way in the back.
[82:53.12]I went all the way back.
[82:54.48]Okay, I'll get it.
[82:55.20]Here we go.
[83:00.53]If you do slash die, you will appear right at the beginning of the maze.
[83:08.11]This way.
[83:10.01]There's the diamond.
[83:10.91]I'm going to make some Hansel and Gretel shit here, okay?
[83:12.93]Yes, I can.
[83:17.73]No, this way.
[83:23.70]It's gonna last six hours.
[83:24.82]No, it won't.
[83:25.56]I have the magic of the fucking staff.
[83:27.36]I can just break through a wall if I want.
[83:39.39]Okay, yeah, they're working on the queue thing right now.
[83:41.25]That's what they're telling me.
[83:42.93]So, we'll see.
[83:45.90]Yeah, people can still come in, but there's just a problem with the actual number.
[83:50.90]Like, it's running into itself, essentially.
[83:53.14]They're trying to figure it out.
[83:56.41]Stop cheat- I'm not- I'm just collecting samples.
[83:58.35]Alright.
[84:03.41]This- how did I go the wrong way?
[84:08.65]Here, come on- come this way.
[84:10.61]I know I just fucking cheated, but it's alright.
[84:12.67]How did you guys- how did you guys do that?
[84:27.91]That was kind of unfair.
[84:30.05]That was unfair.
[84:33.53]And I even blocked it too, so they can't go that way.
[84:39.01]I'm just checking on how people are doing, and I don't have to beat this.
[84:41.72]I just have to check on people.
[84:43.72]Oh, fuck, you got in.
[84:44.58]It's alright.
[84:44.94]Alright, let me see where people are.
[84:58.64]Oh, nice.
[84:59.36]That's a pretty cool costume, dude.
[85:09.47]Alright, hey, how close are we?
[85:11.29]How far away from the end are we?
[85:14.69]At this stage now.
[85:17.69]We are absolutely nowhere near the end of this maze.
[85:22.21]Not even close.
[85:22.77]Alright, well, what if I do this?
[85:35.32]Somebody might actually beat it, he said.
[85:42.55]Wait, do people... Am I the only one that can do this?
[85:48.49]I got banned and the reason listed was A. A, we'll cut it out.
[85:57.73]I'm just a helper.
[85:58.50]I'm just helping.
[86:05.08]Somebody is apparently close to the end.
[86:07.71]Or at least close enough.
[86:10.25]I kind of want to see.
[86:11.59]I want to look over here.
[86:12.49]Can I see?
[86:12.93]I want to see where everybody is.
[86:15.73]I have no idea where the hell I'm supposed to be going right now.
[86:32.25]Is that a Snorlax?
[86:33.07]That's a Snorlax costume.
[86:34.59]Hey guys, I found another way!
[86:39.03]That person has a Minecon cape?
[86:42.33]Yeah, this is today!
[86:43.21]Why are we doing this?
[86:45.17]It's a Minecraft day!
[86:51.22]Can I be TP'd to the maze, please?
[86:56.14]Type slash die.
[86:58.26]You will be at the very beginning.
[87:05.12]Hey, what if I had to take this wall down?
[87:09.14]Is it Minecraft Minecon 2013 shirt?
[87:13.78]That's the rare one.
[87:19.72]I feel like I'm making this harder.
[87:20.72]Did somebody beat it?
[87:32.99]Who beat it?
[87:38.61]Hold on, what was it, GM3?
[87:45.13]Oh my fucking god.
[87:58.34]There are people that are really are right at the end, you're so close!
[88:10.55]Oh wow, you guys are so close!
[88:13.89]You're almost there!
[88:15.07]It's right here!
[88:15.71]Oh, you did it!
[88:19.23]Somebody actually did it!
[88:20.19]I can't... A lot of you did it!
[88:21.57]Holy shit, almost all of you did it!
[88:24.82]Where was I?
[88:25.28]What the hell was I doing?
[88:28.54]How far was I?
[88:29.40]How far away was I?
[88:34.36]I was like three quarters.
[88:35.22]This is a cool looking level.
[88:44.31]TPing to you.
[88:46.39]Oh, it's dead on.
[88:53.14]I wasn't here.
[88:53.70]This is, uh... Oh, we got a boss battle.
[88:58.94]All the servers, uh, queue servers are down.
[89:00.53]Yeah, I think they're coming down because I think they're trying to apply a fix so that these people can get in.
[89:17.39]What's his name?
[89:18.11]The Enderknife?
[89:22.55]If you hit slash die, you'll get teleported into this room, everybody.
[89:24.87]This is unfair.
[89:30.29]This dude is... He can't even move!
[89:38.18]We keep going into these people's really cool looking houses.
[89:43.24]Oh, wait, fuck!
[89:44.18]Look at this stuff!
[89:54.70]Did we just cheese him?
[89:55.56]No, he still has health.
[89:59.38]Stun lock penetration.
[90:08.80]So he's shitting out these little bugs.
[90:10.02]Do these bugs hurt?
[90:25.50]They're everywhere!
[90:27.12]I can't even kill them fast enough!
[90:32.08]Get him, yeah.
[90:33.06]Get him.
[90:41.21]Alright, did the Ender Knight just win with a walk-off Grand Slam in the World Series?
[90:55.73]I don't even know where he is.
[90:59.55]Everybody's swarming this guy.
[91:00.93]I'm just waiting for a Gatorade jug to be dumped on his head.
[91:06.58]Just kill him.
[91:07.00]Don't even let him do anything.
[91:07.64]Just don't even let him move.
[91:20.88]Is anybody even dead?
[91:24.14]I don't think he's hurt anybody.
[91:25.29]I don't think he can.
[91:27.49]I think he's been stunlocked the whole time.
[91:31.73]Don't you die if an Enderman looks at you for like five seconds?
[91:34.68]He can't even look at anybody.
[91:50.85]He's like, he's almost, he's gonna be dead here in a second.
[92:00.44]Wham?
[92:01.90]Wham?
[92:04.74]Oh, oh, okay.
[92:05.64]I know what you're doing.
[92:11.52]How did everybody get diamond armor this quickly?
[92:14.45]Is there armaments that they could get into?
[92:16.49]Somebody said, sorry, but I'm officially lost in the maze.
[92:23.12]Yeah, man.
[92:23.72]I feel you.
[92:24.50]I feel you, dude.
[92:25.46]I know.
[92:26.56]If you want to give up a life, you can do slash die and get in here.
[92:30.30]I know, man.
[92:31.00]It's fucking rough.
[92:38.34]Are you in the first maze?
[92:42.75]If you're in the first maze, I know, man.
[92:44.35]It's hard.
[92:44.83]It's really hard.
[92:49.35]We kill him?
[92:53.11]I think we killed him.
[92:57.55]Hello?
[93:00.33]Wait.
[93:00.75]What?
[93:02.30]Oh, he's dead.
[93:02.94]We got it.
[93:05.20]Alright.
[93:06.00]Nice.
[93:06.18]We got it.
[93:06.76]Look at this.
[93:07.08]Look at that dragon.
[93:08.30]That's a pretty sick dragon.
[93:13.36]Wait until maze three.
[93:14.82]Well, we'll see.
[93:16.24]Alright.
[93:19.16]Coming up next, we have, I think, another... Is it another jump map?
[93:33.79]Oh, god damn it.
[93:34.49]I fell already.
[93:34.99]Alright, I actually want to do this one right.
[93:45.91]This looks fun.
[93:46.45]This looks fun.
[93:46.81]I want to do this right.
[93:54.41]You only get 10 lives.
[93:55.45]Keep that in mind.
[93:56.09]Be careful.
[94:01.89]Oh shit.
[94:06.91]Are we going to get a jump maze?
[94:08.25]That'd be really funny actually.
[94:12.09]Anyone else getting, I'm not going to say that.
[94:13.72]This is a mine cough, uh, mine, uh, guy, mine con stream.
[94:21.68]I almost said conference.
[94:35.80]god damn it what alright whatever let's go I'm Bob gotta play mine con day stream not mine conference day
[95:04.46]Career ending blunder.
[95:07.81]Stop.
[95:10.57]What?
[95:11.91]How did you beat it already?
[95:13.23]What the fuck?
[95:20.55]Look at this guy.
[95:28.06]Oh my god.
[95:29.26]No way.
[95:34.62]There's a couple people that are doing really well.
[95:38.89]This is not a paid actor.
[95:40.55]Now, cut to my camera.
[95:47.23]This is us normal people.
[95:51.99]Okay, some of you are not even jumping.
[95:53.79]You're just walking off and dying.
[96:12.26]I just kind of like watching.
[96:13.36]This is... Oh, they can't see the edge?
[96:16.44]Yeah, I guess that's true.
[96:21.10]What the fuck is that?
[96:23.28]Wait, I thought that was in the wall.
[96:24.70]Wait, that's a person.
[96:34.83]Paid actors.
[96:37.95]No.
[96:38.19]No.
[96:42.44]This is the first jump with the ladder people have a lot of problem with.
[96:47.16]I'd get down there and do it myself, but you know.
[96:48.70]It's kind of fun to see what people do.
[96:54.00]Yeah, if you got... Try to hold on to those lives.
[96:58.19]They're precious.
[97:08.21]If I go down here, it's really interesting to see...
[97:13.68]This group right here is really, really doing pretty well.
[97:16.22]I think they're working together.
[97:17.01]I think they're playing together.
[97:20.29]Oh, that guy tried to just flex so hard and he dropped.
[97:22.67]That was a huge flex that guy was trying to do.
[97:27.47]He was going like World 1-1 Mario strat.
[97:29.95]You just don't stop moving.
[97:30.83]Somebody's shooting an arrow at me.
[97:38.92]It's not going to work, man.
[97:48.71]Alright, I'm going to try.
[97:49.51]I want to try now.
[97:52.78]Do some shoutcasting.
[97:53.92]Okay, yeah, sure.
[97:57.52]Welcome to the entrance of the dungeon here.
[98:00.24]We have quite a few players.
[98:03.08]We've got... Co-Hagen here.
[98:06.79]Co-7.
[98:09.55]Gohagan here, taking a look over the edge of the world here, like a few of his fellow players.
[98:15.65]We also have him and his team there.
[98:17.42]There's 16 teams of 25 people at the same time.
[98:24.96]Palmsteel making a big jump for it, gets to there.
[98:27.68]I'm not sure what happened next.
[98:28.54]He looks like he's stuffed underneath all the players.
[98:31.66]Really, really bad spot to be in when you can't see.
[98:33.70]Hopefully he has his hide slash all activated.
[98:37.38]We've got El Querti keyboard up here.
[98:40.18]Nice jump onto the tire.
[98:42.25]Nice jump onto the tires.
[98:44.51]Can he make it all the way up around?
[98:46.49]He can go over the top.
[98:49.39]Here comes one of the hardest jumps of the entire event.
[98:51.20]Can he?
[98:51.50]Got it!
[98:52.90]El Querti.
[98:55.16]Showing us how to do it.
[98:58.35]Falling down into the pool.
[98:59.69]This is the tough part.
[99:00.94]And he makes it too.
[99:01.80]We're following Qwerty here, folks.
[99:05.02]Doing an excellent job.
[99:07.60]Now he's got this.
[99:08.70]He gots the double ladder jump to make.
[99:10.56]Now crouching.
[99:11.22]Make sure to fall off.
[99:12.13]If you don't play Minecraft, if you crouch, you don't fall off.
[99:15.69]He's using that to his advantage.
[99:16.59]And no!
[99:18.45]Qwerty.
[99:18.83]Qwerty gone.
[99:22.41]Now we have the court jester.
[99:30.06]When he's naked?
[99:34.27]There are people that aren't even trying.
[99:35.29]They're just shooting with arrows.
[99:41.49]Come on.
[99:42.01]Come on.
[99:44.07]Super Daza.
[99:44.81]Super Daza.
[99:45.97]That was a couple of really good jumps in a row.
[99:49.64]Let's see it.
[99:55.60]Line it up.
[99:56.48]Oh, got it.
[99:57.52]Got it.
[99:57.86]Dude, no!
[100:01.68]Hey, come on.
[100:02.36]Quit hogging the little steak here, man.
[100:07.60]Is this person just naked?
[100:08.60]No.
[100:13.14]This looks like the hard one because you have to balance on this and then jump to here.
[100:20.00]That person has a +2 JermaCraft joke?
[100:25.12]I'm going for it.
[100:28.82]I wanna be one of the people here.
[100:37.10]This is what it's like.
[100:37.78]How do you grab a ladder?
[100:47.21]It's whole W, right?
[100:57.74]Oh, I just told you I was cheating.
[101:03.49]What is A?
[101:04.25]Why are people being banned for A?
[101:06.69]I don't know.
[101:07.69]I have no idea.
[101:08.43]What does A mean?
[101:13.09]What a jump that was.
[101:14.01]Oh, I had some lag there.
[101:16.62]Having a little bit of lag.
[101:18.70]I'm okay.
[101:20.20]Seems kind of laggy.
[101:21.16]It's probably the server issues.
[101:22.92]There's a server problem sometimes.
[101:24.32]Alright, I'm on.
[101:27.46]Yeah, I think that's... I don't know what A means.
[101:29.48]Because we had to quickly just turn off the server and make it 250 instead of 400, something got messed up, and they're trying to figure it out.
[101:40.02]But I will tell you this.
[101:41.34]This server is just going to be on after this is over.
[101:45.32]This stream essentially is a gigantic advertisement for the fact that this is going to stay turned on for 24-7, and it's going to just kind of turn into like a Minecraft server.
[101:53.60]There's a giant advertisement for it.
[101:54.86]You're going to be able to play through this whenever you want.
[102:02.14]Sellout.
[102:02.60]It's not a sellout if it's the server that's my name.
[102:15.27]What, are you gonna do a fire festival stream?
[102:19.99]I don't want to play your damn maze.
[102:22.73]Stay!
[102:31.94]Ego maniac sellout, that's so funny.
[102:39.52]Alright, this is a hard one.
[102:47.47]Just fuckin' watch out for the wind, there's Mario wind.
[102:50.77]You fall off the edge, but there's a- watch out for the wind.
[103:01.32]See?
[103:05.18]What a recovery.
[103:10.12]I want to try this jump here with nobody here.
[103:12.09]Let me turn it off.
[103:16.39]That didn't work.
[103:18.99]Yeah, remember, if you're stuck somewhere, if you're in an old game, type slash die.
[103:31.32]Oh, fuck.
[103:31.66]I actually made it.
[103:38.05]This is a fire festival stream.
[103:40.27]Yeah, that's alright.
[103:42.42]At least it works.
[103:45.38]An hour ago, I didn't think it was even going to work.
[103:50.64]It's actually kind of cool.
[103:51.40]It's actually fun.
[103:59.41]Can you pause the stream?
[104:01.63]Can you pause the stream?
[104:02.37]I need to eat my pasta.
[104:06.52]Uh... Just go.
[104:10.52]What?
[104:16.75]It's alright.
[104:17.21]You're not gonna miss much.
[104:18.85]I'm still gonna be falling on the same jump every time.
[104:20.73]Oh, fuck.
[104:32.16]He hates his viewers.
[104:33.28]What?
[104:36.76]No, I can't.
[104:37.92]These people that have beat it.
[104:40.36]That's over 50%.
[104:41.26]I think we can go to the next arena.
[104:49.73]Yeah, that's a lot of people.
[104:50.95]Yeah, that's enough to keep going.
[104:54.25]Pause it.
[104:54.63]Pause it.
[104:54.93]I've actually seen one of them.
[105:02.73]Holy shit.
[105:06.33]Final Fantasy 6?
[105:07.13]8?
[105:07.37]Alright, how do we keep going?
[105:10.53]7, right, right, right.
[105:21.26]How come I can't see anything?
[105:31.74]It said the ones in between.
[105:32.82]Yeah, yeah.
[105:35.28]Alright, what is this one?
[105:46.13]King's Armory is this way.
[105:53.46]Oh, this is where we got the diamond shit.
[105:55.58]Nice.
[106:01.21]How do I put- I gotta put this all on.
[106:03.40]What am I stuck in cement?
[106:32.83]There's fire all over the ground.
[106:34.75]Do you have a health bar too?
[106:59.88]What about the raid loot?
[107:01.80]Is there any raid loot?
[107:02.67]I think there might be something falling out of them.
[107:27.46]He just destroyed that guy.
[107:31.32]That guy was nothing.
[107:44.34]This area is like really cool looking.
[107:52.85]That looks awesome.
[108:00.54]Uh, where's the next room?
[108:01.28]Down here?
[108:11.21]Here we go.
[108:13.15]Boys and girls, it looks like it's gonna be time for a maze.
[108:21.28]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[108:22.04]No, never mind.
[108:43.12]Turn the OST back up.
[108:45.36]Not too loud, though.
[109:00.38]Man of three voices, man of three minigames.
[109:14.61]good that was pretty good that was that was really funny but ban that person for an hour okay the guy uh I just got in my ear maybe that's working on this stuff on the other side and just said are you just shooting into the crowd I didn't realize that yeah I'm I'm just shooting into the fucking crowd
[109:51.53]So who... This... It's ice blocks.
[109:56.97]Oh, fuck that.
[109:57.91]I ain't gonna be able to do that one.
[110:02.71]Oh, nice try.
[110:14.34]Yeah, you can barely even see the blocks.
[110:17.16]Someone will get it.
[110:25.78]Cycle of life.
[110:26.88]Man of three voices.
[110:28.18]Man of three minigames.
[110:31.97]I nominate that for a moment.
[110:41.91]Melon boy.
[110:43.59]Wait, no.
[110:43.91]That was what you're supposed to do.
[110:45.69]Was it?
[110:56.04]Some of the guys that were parkouring really well.
[110:59.38]This looks tricky for them.
[111:05.62]And green tea sips.
[111:06.64]He's killing people.
[111:09.00]Oh, well, at some point somebody got my lightning stick and just started casting it at random people.
[111:18.57]I don't even know where that is now.
[111:20.43]I have no idea where it is.
[111:33.13]Alright, four or five people have made it here.
[111:42.54]Here are the saviors of this level.
[111:57.19]Green T Sips has committed A, get rid of him.
[112:11.31]What does any of this have to do with the king?
[112:13.01]Well, it had something to do with it, but everything kind of broke multiple times, so we just skipped all the lore just to get into the video game.
[112:27.12]It was significant lore here.
[112:34.42]shit they're almost here once you go all the way around then you just go from here you go oh that sucks wow that sucks it's a look yeah that's so funny look at how many people are just waiting at the bottom waiting for someone to beat it these guys are just hanging out this might as well just be minecon
[113:01.35]Everybody's in diamond armor, has diamond swords, just walking around.
[113:05.01]There are people that are really trying to... There's a significant amount of people that are attempting the first part.
[113:18.18]Yeah, and some of them are just kind of like walking into each other and walking around.
[113:33.10]Everybody else?
[113:35.64]Are you the guy that's from Boston that beat Dark Souls 3 on stream?
[113:38.98]I hope not.
[113:41.00]I am.
[113:41.78]Sorry to say.
[113:50.38]Mental anguish from the queue.
[113:53.07]I wish there was something that I could do about it.
[113:55.13]But I cannot do anything about it.
[113:58.15]All I can hope is that maybe they can figure out what the problem is?
[114:04.72]I am just participating.
[114:07.84]I am just participating with you all.
[114:16.35]Apparently there are thousands and thousands of people that are trying to do it.
[114:21.31]And that's fine.
[114:22.17]That should work.
[114:23.63]But the problem is when we changed it from 400 to 250, it fucked up all the stuff in the server.
[114:28.67]So they're trying to figure it out.
[114:31.13]A true king would have freed us by now.
[114:34.44]I can't.
[114:36.04]I'm king in name only.
[114:38.08]Understand?
[114:39.34]What's that movie?
[114:43.08]Isn't there a movie about a guy that's not a real guy?
[114:46.90]He's like, he's not the real... Fuck the king.
[114:55.73]He's the useless king.
[114:57.23]Worst king.
[114:57.75]Puppet king.
[115:01.29]Yeah.
[115:11.49]This is why you should do practice streams.
[115:13.21]We did, many of them.
[115:15.78]Just don't know.
[115:25.02]Shrek 4D incoming.
[115:26.83]The Discord is absolutely mauled right now.
[115:32.79]I don't even want to go over there.
[115:35.67]It's like going home with a bad report card.
[115:37.41]I don't want to go in there.
[115:39.45]I'm gonna go to my friend Dave's house for like an hour.
[115:49.25]Hey, son, are you coming home to show your report card?
[115:51.87]Yeah, yeah, I, um... Yeah, I will.
[115:56.72]Dave, do you have this exact black ink that matches the report card so I can change this to a B?
[116:05.39]I just need to put a line through the D. We need to make it a perfect B. Is somebody making progress?
[116:22.58]Did he do it?
[116:28.03]He did it!
[116:34.49]New king!
[116:35.07]No, he gets an item.
[116:36.33]He gets the golden boots of, the golden boots of Ratatouille stream incoming.
[116:47.14]Keep those on.
[116:53.64]No, nice work.
[116:54.80]Let's go!
[117:01.71]I actually know what one of the mazes is.
[117:04.23]And if everyone's going to fucking flip out.
[117:08.77]Everyone's going to lose their minds.
[117:11.42]In fact, we should probably just skip it.
[117:13.26]Because people are going to get very, very mad at me for having it.
[117:15.98]They're going to be very mad at me.
[117:17.26]I'm going to get screamed at.
[117:21.99]Just shoot into the peasants.
[117:25.69]Why am I listening to you?
[117:30.01]So many arrows, yeah.
[117:31.05]Alright, are we moving on to the next one?
[117:35.03]Do you ever flab with a guy that makes poop jokes?
[117:42.07]Poop jokes?
[117:42.84]I do that.
[117:43.26]That's me.
[117:43.52]Is this the entrance?
[117:52.76]Can we not get through this?
[117:58.20]Oh, there we go.
[117:58.56]Oh, yeah.
[118:01.33]Dude, maze three, pog!
[118:04.69]Maze three, pog!
[118:15.60]Pog, maze!
[118:19.12]Pog, maze, found it!
[118:26.83]So fake.
[118:29.92]Let me just find the exit real quick.
[118:37.88]How many more rooms are there?
[118:38.96]I think there's only like five more rooms or something.
[118:48.68]Grandma, I am sad.
[119:02.14]Get in here!
[119:06.44]By the way, this is a three level maze.
[119:08.64]There's staircases between each maze.
[119:11.85]This is three tier.
[119:13.01]This is a three tiered cake maze.
[119:14.93]This is the hard one.
[119:16.87]And don't worry, if nobody figures it out in the next 30 to 60 seconds, I'm cutting through the bottom of the cake and I'm gonna pop out like a fucking birthday party.
[119:29.87]Irma's torturing his fans.
[119:34.40]I keep like laughing too much today.
[119:37.08]I'm gonna be in pain.
[119:42.25]Just like torture people.
[119:52.21]It's so funny.
[119:52.95]It's just you guys are just roasting me right now and it's fucking hilarious dude.
[120:08.58]Wait, how?
[120:09.02]People are actually getting up top.
[120:11.44]They shouldn't be able to do that, right?
[120:18.09]You can get up.
[120:25.79]This is a great view though.
[120:27.25]This is what a scientist feels like when he looks down.
[120:29.77]Like the mouse and the cheese and shit.
[120:34.78]Outplayed.
[120:38.58]Where's the staircase?
[120:41.17]Would you ever make a Gouda Cheese review?
[120:42.75]Yeah, I'll do it right now.
[120:43.97]It's alright.
[120:54.18]We are but rats in a maze.
[120:57.12]Actually, did this... Being just an observer is much better.
[121:00.59]I can just see people's progress.
[121:06.98]Maze experiment.
[121:07.92]It's the Stanford... I just puked.
[121:10.90]Stanford maze experiment?
[121:14.64]Somebody already got to it.
[121:15.81]Somebody made it up to the next tier already.
[121:17.87]This one's not even that bad.
[121:26.21]Oh, he's trying to see where the staircase is.
[121:31.63]I have, like, god mode.
[121:33.03]I can't even see where it is.
[121:47.21]The cruel torture of your viewers.
[121:51.57]Forcing you to do a bunch of gigantic mazes and shit.
[121:59.38]Just torturing everybody.
[122:05.92]When do you release the creepers?
[122:07.36]Yeah, I feel like I should be the AI director.
[122:12.66]Why are there holes in the ground?
[122:13.94]Oh my god, that's evil.
[122:17.10]Holy shit, that's fucking evil.
[122:18.56]Because then you have to do the whole thing at the bottom again.
[122:20.78]Oh my goodness, that's evil.
[122:31.19]Is this Star Wars music?
[122:32.27]I don't think so.
[122:32.77]I think it's copyright free.
[122:38.62]Oh, there it is right here.
[122:43.08]So there's another layer up top.
[122:49.15]Somebody's already at the top.
[122:53.03]This did not take as long.
[122:54.49]Why is this one taking so few amount of time?
[122:58.38]But the other ones were so much harder.
[123:01.46]Oh, right, because you could peek.
[123:03.20]Oh, right, right, right, right, right.
[123:06.34]Guys, I promise you there's only one more maze and it's the worst one.
[123:11.06]And this, it's going to be horrendous.
[123:14.38]I've seen it already.
[123:15.76]There's only one more maze.
[123:28.03]It's absurd.
[123:29.11]You guys are going to lose your minds.
[123:30.87]It's going to be worse?
[123:31.69]Yes.
[123:32.85]Way worse.
[123:35.61]You don't even know.
[123:37.73]Way more difficult.
[123:51.17]Oh, there's no cheating on level 3.
[123:57.59]We're losing consciousness.
[124:04.73]So.
[124:07.66]Realm of the Mad King.
[124:09.22]Yeah.
[124:10.38]Oh, shit.
[124:10.72]I have my lightning again.
[124:12.90]Oh, I'm sorry.
[124:13.36]I didn't mean to do that to you.
[124:15.96]You're my favorite fuckbang streamer.
[124:19.52]Thanks, man.
[124:24.10]Somebody said, I rescheduled my SATs for this shit.
[124:27.96]Dude, oh man.
[124:29.22]Did you?
[124:29.54]Did you?
[124:35.79]Did you?
[124:36.15]You've reskilled your SATs?
[124:37.99]You gotta take those, man.
[124:39.29]That's important knowledge you have to have.
[124:58.72]Dude, I rescheduled my fucking... Dude, I rescheduled my SATs.
[125:13.10]I lost my Saturday.
[125:14.56]Stop!
[125:15.16]Alright.
[125:16.52]I'm climbing out.
[125:17.28]I'm climbing out.
[125:17.82]I'm climbing out.
[125:18.32]I'm climbing out.
[125:18.80]I'm out.
[125:19.08]I'm out.
[125:19.32]I'm climbing out.
[125:25.02]I'm gonna get out of here.
[125:26.04]And I'm gonna find the exit and I'm gonna win.
[125:29.30]Oh shit, you can't go through bedrock.
[125:30.63]Not even God can go through bedrock.
[125:32.47]Shit!
[125:42.08]You're on your honeymoon right now?
[125:45.86]Well, dude, close the laptop.
[125:48.82]Like, slam it down right now.
[125:50.29]Don't get caught watching this stream.
[125:56.28]Oh shit, ow.
[125:58.38]Alright, I'm using god powers.
[126:04.92]Where's the exit?
[126:08.58]Cruel punishment.
[126:13.43]It's so cruel.
[126:23.21]Somebody, oh no, that's, okay, that's like the AI director.
[126:29.05]There ain't nobody even up here.
[126:35.18]Discord is crying.
[126:37.20]Oh shit, I found the exit!
[126:38.22]What do- what do you mean they made it?
[126:57.07]What?
[127:02.27]How the fuck did you two do this?
[127:05.91]There's no way.
[127:06.57]There's no way you two did this.
[127:07.97]How did you do this?
[127:10.33]It's like... That seems impossible.
[127:22.29]Bring them all over here.
[127:23.11]It's time for John... Oh, I'm gonna die.
[127:25.07]No, I can't die.
[127:25.67]I have god mode on.
[127:26.29]I forgot.
[127:30.71]No, wait.
[127:31.01]What?
[127:38.41]Oh shit, did I just break the whole thing?
[127:40.95]I think I may have broken everything.
[127:52.82]Jumping pog, let's go.
[128:00.21]I missed my son's birthday for this.
[128:02.47]Well, you should be a better father instead of skipping your son's birthday to watch a Minecraft stream.
[128:12.51]You should play Minecraft with your son.
[128:14.63]Alright, if you do slash die, you will TP to the beginning of this final parkour map.
[128:26.03]Sick, sick, sick.
[128:38.46]I missed my prostate exam for this.
[128:42.79]Well, reschedule it and go back.
[128:52.83]I got two lives left now, thanks.
[128:55.16]Well, don't worry.
[128:55.92]We're nearing the end of the dungeon.
[129:04.20]You missed your heart surgery for this?
[129:05.61]Well, rip.
[129:06.99]Sorry.
[129:10.55]This is the prostate exam, you motherfucker.
[129:16.57]God damn it.
[129:22.10]People are actually doing really well on these though.
[129:39.56]I miss nothing for this.
[129:40.78]You're all I have.
[129:41.58]Hey, well, thanks for sticking around, man.
[129:47.49]Thanks for watching our Minecon coverage.
[129:54.66]What else are they adding to Minecraft?
[130:01.08]What can you add to Minecraft?
[130:08.15]Cave update.
[130:08.77]Is that cool?
[130:09.85]What does that do?
[130:12.67]Adding swearing to Minecraft.
[130:14.25]That'd be weird.
[130:19.09]Everyone going into the queue is immediately being kicked.
[130:21.06]Yeah, I know.
[130:21.70]I know.
[130:22.90]It's all fucked up.
[130:25.78]It's all fucked up.
[130:36.89]It's literally what people have been waiting for for a long time.
[130:39.65]Wait, does it make the actual... Okay, when you dig down in Minecraft and you get the cave, did they change how that works?
[130:47.40]Did they make that cooler and better?
[130:49.20]Because that's kind of huge.
[130:50.79]If that's more fun, it already was kind of fun.
[131:05.95]Releasing next year.
[131:13.56]Caves have better generation and unique biomes.
[131:15.78]Holy shit.
[131:16.76]That sounds fucking interesting.
[131:26.86]I miss playing Mario Kart with my girlfriend's husband for this.
[131:42.17]Is somebody beating it almost again?
[131:45.55]Somebody's getting close.
[131:49.69]You're almost there, man.
[131:52.71]Why did you read that?
[131:53.81]Wow.
[131:55.47]Wait, wait.
[131:55.99]This is just the big jump.
[131:57.23]This is the big jump.
[131:57.85]You got to get this.
[132:01.19]Got it.
[132:02.00]You did it.
[132:03.78]Wait, is that not it?
[132:05.06]Oh, that's not it.
[132:06.00]Oh, shit.
[132:06.38]There's more.
[132:06.76]This person's really good.
[132:23.75]No!
[132:27.15]That was close.
[132:31.21]Damn it.
[132:34.38]What's left after that?
[132:35.30]Just a little bit more, right?
[132:44.79]Check link.
[132:45.35]Let me see.
[132:54.89]What's the link?
[132:55.39]Let me see.
[132:58.81]Unknown Pog, what?
[133:06.56]Unknown Pog?
[133:13.28]Wait, unban for $40?
[133:15.28]Wait, what is this?
[133:19.61]That's not here.
[133:20.37]That's not this stream.
[133:30.10]That's not this stream.
[133:34.39]It is?
[133:35.17]No, it can't be.
[133:42.75]There's no... You don't just pay and get unbanned from this server.
[134:11.58]It's global?
[134:15.18]That's not me.
[134:16.14]I didn't tell you to do that.
[134:18.96]I didn't say buy a $40 unbanned.
[134:21.94]I didn't say that.
[134:32.05]Yeah, I've just been piped into my ear.
[134:34.09]It is not for this server.
[134:39.84]It was your suggestion.
[134:41.06]It was not my suggestion.
[134:42.44]Hey, now you're putting words in my mouth and you're taking them out of something else that never existed in the first place.
[134:50.69]We all agreed.
[134:52.49]No, I didn't.
[134:57.33]I'm just trying to get people's money.
[135:04.32]He's scheming with Senator Dave State again.
[135:16.49]Zombie Eater gave $100.
[135:17.41]They said, hey, I got banned.
[135:19.03]Here's $100.
[135:19.55]Please unban me.
[135:20.41]God damn it.
[135:32.45]His eyes are bulging with imagined riches.
[135:52.47]I should have just opened it in OnlyFans.
[135:54.07]Oh, fuck.
[135:56.39]Fuck.
[136:05.44]We have a finisher almost here.
[136:07.54]They're almost at the very end.
[136:08.70]What, do they have two, four more jumps?
[136:15.18]You can do it to get us to a... You can do it.
[136:17.34]You're almost there, man.
[136:18.22]Come on, you can do it.
[136:33.95]He's deflecting so he can scam us.
[136:37.39]Do not deflect.
[136:38.33]PsychoStreamer tortures his viewers for hours.
[136:46.34]I would watch your OnlyFans.
[136:48.28]I'm not going to have an OnlyFans.
[136:49.52]Why the hell would I have an OnlyFans?
[136:52.62]31.
[136:57.88]Oh, thank you.
[136:58.64]We have a winner.
[137:00.70]Hermit Spy Crab, excellent work!
[137:02.54]You won yourself a piece of golden armor from me, the king!
[137:07.48]Where are you, man?
[137:08.54]Let's get you front row, so the strain can see you.
[137:24.28]Where are they?
[137:29.96]Okay, where are you, man?
[137:34.79]Okay.
[137:36.87]There you are.
[137:37.49]Here you go.
[137:37.93]You've got golden apples from the king.
[137:40.67]Remember, this is gonna say, was given to you by Jerma985.
[137:44.23]So hold onto it forever.
[137:48.04]Oh, I just gave them to like all of you.
[137:52.76]It was stolen.
[137:57.22]Did you get any?
[138:01.48]Did you get any?
[138:04.80]Show me a gold apple.
[138:05.64]Make sure that you got one.
[138:06.84]He didn't get any.
[138:10.80]Well, how about a pair of... This is gold.
[138:15.12]This has gold on it.
[138:16.00]There, yeah.
[138:19.96]See, this is gold.
[138:20.50]There's a gold tip on there.
[138:22.94]Illegal.
[138:25.10]Oh, you guys are gonna love this one.
[138:26.36]You guys are gonna love this one.
[138:28.52]You guys are gonna love this one.
[138:30.10]It's a maze?
[138:30.94]Yeah.
[138:31.50]It's mirrors.
[138:33.28]Some of them have empty spaces.
[138:34.86]It's impossible.
[138:37.36]This shit's impossible.
[138:40.95]Good luck.
[138:43.25]Let the torture commence.
[138:46.15]Ow.
[138:54.76]He rips off the prize winner.
[138:56.16]No, I'll give him.
[138:57.14]Don't worry.
[138:58.56]I didn't know.
[138:59.00]I tried to give it to him.
[139:07.04]I think this is the end.
[139:07.82]I think there's one more room after this.
[139:20.72]I've had a nightmare like this.
[139:21.94]Yeah, I have too.
[139:34.29]End of career voice.
[139:35.43]No, my career is just fine.
[139:38.51]I think I just killed somebody accidentally.
[139:53.50]This sick fuck is making his viewers relive his nightmares.
[140:06.96]All I've been doing is like laughing this whole stream.
[140:09.74]I've been laughing at like just the roast job.
[140:14.21]Every time I look over a chat, there's like a new like top of our roast me comment.
[140:34.50]He's a Redditor?
[140:35.20]Yeah, y'all are Redditors too.
[140:37.18]Everybody here's a Redditor.
[140:43.85]I'm gonna go take a look.
[140:44.91]Let's see where everybody is.
[140:54.43]Alright, alright.
[140:55.62]For all the things that we're talking about, some of you guys are really good at this shit.
[141:04.07]Some of you guys actually are very good at doing this.
[141:08.85]Like, look at the people over here.
[141:09.71]These guys are just on a mission.
[141:19.72]Redditing?
[141:23.18]You're ruining the immersion.
[141:24.36]Well, I'm having you see.
[141:25.18]F...
[141:32.62]That image is just... Can you pull that image up on stream?
[141:43.64]That's funny to me.
[141:46.32]The image that they're spamming in the chat.
[141:47.88]Is it possible to get that shown on the stream?
[142:05.58]He knows what it is.
[142:12.04]Would you be upset if a cow fell through your ceiling?
[142:15.19]Yeah, that would be horrible.
[142:16.49]That would be a terrible thing to have happen.
[142:18.27]What are you talking about?
[142:26.15]If a cow fell through the ceiling right now, that would be a disaster.
[142:39.05]Alright, we got somebody's close.
[142:42.03]Don't look up.
[142:59.70]Where's the closest person?
[143:06.88]I think I would die.
[143:07.94]Yeah, I mean, you would.
[143:11.09]If a cow landed through the ceiling on top of you, or you were sitting at your chair, you're dead.
[143:14.91]You're going to instantly die.
[143:15.87]It's going to break every bone in your body.
[143:17.43]Aren't cows like 700 pounds?
[143:24.84]A cow is like 1,000 pounds.
[143:27.80]That's like half a car dropping on your head.
[143:40.44]He did it!
[143:41.76]See, you guys are actually good at this.
[143:43.18]Some of you guys can actually do this shit really, really well.
[143:53.34]1,400 pounds.
[143:53.90]That's a car, man.
[143:54.92]That's a small car.
[143:55.68]That's one of those gerbil cars.
[143:56.68]Is it called the Kia Gerbil?
[144:03.84]What's the song name?
[144:04.66]I actually don't know.
[144:11.29]Congratulations to those of you that went through.
[144:12.99]Clueless sniper, nice job.
[144:19.04]Thermomobile?
[144:20.74]What?
[144:23.64]Alright, let's move on to the next encounter.
[144:31.97]We're about to enter one of the final rooms.
[144:40.76]Serious Sam?
[144:41.54]Fuck!
[144:41.86]I want to play Serious Sam too.
[144:47.40]Yeah, we can go.
[144:49.11]Where's the actual end?
[144:51.19]I still can't.
[144:51.75]I'm flying around.
[144:52.43]I can't even find the end.
[144:58.93]I have no idea where the end is.
[145:00.25]And I can fly through a building.
[145:01.89]Oh, there we go.
[145:10.42]Alright, here we go.
[145:11.66]This is the final boss.
[145:14.48]The two yetis.
[145:17.52]Oh, fuck.
[145:17.92]These guys actually look like they're attacking.
[145:19.70]Yeah, this is actually dangerous, I think.
[145:23.73]I think people are going to die here.
[145:24.63]What the fuck was that?
[145:34.07]Alright, I'm turning off my god mode.
[145:36.57]I want to get in.
[145:40.90]I thought that was in the game and I just freaked out.
[145:43.26]Another raid boss.
[145:51.43]This is the last raid boss.
[146:01.12]Did they share health?
[146:11.27]This is Cod Zombies.
[146:18.58]Why is someone just jumping in my camera?
[146:20.00]Get out of here.
[146:24.67]I have a diamond sword, don't I?
[146:25.81]Somewhere?
[146:26.13]Where the hell is it?
[146:39.94]Focus one at a time.
[146:44.35]We're splitting our damage up.
[146:45.39]Kill one at a time.
[146:52.31]I need a weapon.
[147:04.16]Try that.
[147:14.78]Let's see if I have any yeah we go oh shit Wait what happened to it I just had it it turned into a bow Oh there we go alright I got my I got my I got my weapon back
[147:45.24]This really is just recess.
[147:47.18]This is what I would feel like this is what recess is like.
[147:51.97]I get it now.
[147:52.55]I know what it's like to be a teacher.
[147:54.21]This is just outdoor recess.
[148:01.09]Just replace the bows with little balls or nerf balls.
[148:13.93]No tanks, all DPS.
[148:15.48]I can't even hurt this guy like this.
[148:21.46]It's just one Chad walking around beating everybody up.
[148:31.41]Where is the bad guy?
[148:36.19]All DPS.
[148:40.43]One of them has two hearts down.
[148:48.56]What the hell kind of school did Jeremy go to?
[148:50.52]No, I'm not, I'm not saying it's like an all-out brawl outside.
[148:54.48]It's just kids like throwing rocks at each other and biting each other and punch all of them or punching each other.
[149:03.83]Yeah, that would be really kind of a fucked up place to be.
[149:08.89]You're right.
[149:16.14]The amount of people just looking and waiting and watching is so funny.
[149:26.91]Bones Brawl?
[149:28.11]Alright, how much health does he have left?
[149:34.91]He's not even rendering on my screen.
[149:44.04]Anybody else feel like that some of these clips can be taken to make it seem like your Minecraft clan is really fucking cool?
[149:58.51]You'll take some of these with the music in the background?
[150:03.71]And look at this, this is like clan chaos.
[150:10.85]Don't fuck with us.
[150:12.23]We're Clan Carnage.
[150:13.63]We don't fuck around at all.
[150:26.42]We're just really, really, really... We're just not intimidating at all.
[150:34.50]Plan cringe?
[150:38.56]Okay, I'm going to start lightning this fucking guy.
[150:41.56]I'm taking 10 health bars down right now.
[150:43.27]Where is he?
[150:53.21]He only has two hearts.
[150:54.39]They would be really close to the microphone.
[151:03.81]Sign up on our website clan carnage dot com.
[151:06.51]If you think you have what it takes.
[151:25.19]Wait, I can type what?
[151:26.33]This is not going to kill.
[151:30.69]If I type slash, does that kill everybody if I do slash kill?
[151:38.12]Can I get confirmed what that does?
[151:39.52]What happens if I do slash kill?
[151:42.94]Yeah, it would be a WordPress or blog spot.
[151:45.64]That's true.
[151:50.52]Ow.
[151:55.38]Plan carnage.
[151:56.70]Accepting applications now.
[152:04.56]Only kill mobs?
[152:09.07]Can I get a manual kill on this guy?
[152:11.63]How come I can't even see him?
[152:22.04]Why is it still in my own game?
[152:23.70]I feel like I'm not even here.
[152:31.56]Why is my lightning stick not killing anything?
[152:36.33]He's gone invisible.
[152:39.07]Oh, it works on players only.
[152:40.27]Okay.
[152:45.59]Remember, you never existed.
[152:53.59]Oh, did I get him?
[152:54.67]Did I actually hit him with something?
[153:07.48]Welcome to Clan Carnage.
[153:14.95]Oh shit, what?
[153:21.58]Wait, did we kill it?
[153:22.68]Did we win?
[153:38.31]Mystical sword.
[153:39.80]Whoa!
[153:46.20]Oh my god, people are dying.
[153:47.66]People are dying.
[153:48.72]What do we do?
[153:50.08]What do we do?
[153:50.40]What's going on?
[153:50.90]Did somebody put like a kill block here?
[153:54.86]How do I move them?
[154:03.87]Is it dead?
[154:12.40]Oh, they're being telefragged.
[154:20.47]Dude, I can't even see.
[154:23.79]I'm just getting colors.
[154:25.17]It looks like the beginning of the stream.
[154:26.23]It looks like the structure that they made.
[154:27.68]That work?
[154:40.26]I'm stuck on a block with somebody.
[154:44.31]Yeah, one of these blocks.
[154:45.55]I'm at times 10 speed right now.
[154:52.32]Alright, I have this dragon sword.
[154:53.58]Am I gonna go kill this dragon?
[154:55.00]Alright guys, it's time for the end of recess.
[155:08.38]Hopefully the bell doesn't ring before we go pretend to kill the dragon.
[155:16.54]All of a sudden, it's gonna be like, No!
[155:19.68]We're about to kill the dragon!
[155:24.89]Come on in, you little bastards!
[155:32.08]No!
[155:32.48]We're not done with the dragon!
[155:34.50]You had- I had the fucking dragon!
[155:37.00]Yeah!
[155:38.56]Now get the fucking class!
[155:41.94]Uh... Okay.
[155:49.55]Dragon coming?
[155:54.31]It's a dragon.
[155:55.41]Oh, whoa!
[155:56.21]Oh, boy, we got extra time in recess!
[155:58.15]The principal came out!
[156:00.69]Hey, kids.
[156:03.28]It's me, the principal.
[156:04.68]I know that you guys wanted to play some more outside, and frankly, I need another 20 minutes in my office.
[156:11.90]Recess has been extended by ten minutes.
[156:18.77]Go have fun and slay whatever dragon you want.
[156:24.11]That's right, remember me!
[156:26.13]And tell your parents to vote for me.
[156:27.71]I'm running for Selectman 2 next year.
[156:30.93]Don't tell them that Principal Danny Davidson won't even have an extra 15 minutes at recess.
[156:40.20]And by the way, I'm getting rid of taxes in this whole county.
[156:45.96]Tell them that too.
[156:50.04]I can't see.
[156:56.06]There's two dragons?
[156:57.64]Holy shit!
[156:58.46]Kill him, kill him, kill him!
[157:09.96]They're fighting each other!
[157:15.00]They're fighting each other!
[157:17.14]It's two dragons!
[157:19.20]They're killing each other!
[157:22.20]Where did this one come from?
[157:26.56]Get off me.
[157:27.98]Get off me.
[157:28.74]One of the cafeteria ladies jumped on me.
[157:31.26]You can't give them extra time outside.
[157:34.30]They need to learn.
[157:34.98]Get off me.
[157:37.50]Kids, don't worry.
[157:38.16]I'll take care of this.
[157:41.97]Oh, shit.
[157:42.19]She's throwing trays at me.
[157:46.21]You idiot.
[157:47.89]Ow.
[157:54.22]Everyone get back in class!
[158:04.58]And remember... Mystery meet today!
[158:13.99]Get her!
[158:16.83]No, get away from me!
[158:19.63]You little shit kid!
[158:22.31]Have some more sloppy juice.
[158:28.83]I made an extra sloppy for you.
[158:31.74]Oh, I know how you kids like a sloppy.
[158:38.54]We got her!
[158:42.65]We got him!
[158:49.09]We did it.
[158:51.39]We killed the dragon.
[158:57.29]Hey, let me get off here and say, let it be known that kids now rule the school.
[159:13.09]No more nap times, no more math homework.
[159:17.71]We run the school.
[159:20.31]Recess all day.
[159:24.15]And French fries only for lunch.
[159:33.10]Kids, come on in.
[159:37.14]It's time for recess to be over.
[159:38.96]It's me, Principal Davidson, just a regular person, not anything weird going on.
[159:43.92]I'm just normal.
[159:46.30]Oh, what the heck?
[159:48.44]Okay, yeah, it's gone.
[159:49.29]I've got to go.
[159:49.89]I've got to go into school now.
[159:59.39]For the kindergarten!
[160:02.80]This structure is perfect for the kindergarten, by the way.
[160:07.24]This is just kindergarten scream.
[160:11.06]This was just, this was keep.
[160:13.40]Oh, we went to, we went to kindergarten school.
[160:16.70]Mm-hmm.
[160:17.28]This is just the plot of Billy Madison.
[160:20.40]Here, go build something with these blocks, like a bunch of you.
[160:23.50]I'm not going to fucking pay attention.
[160:24.68]Just go do it.
[160:26.22]Hey, look, I made a really, really hard maze that none of you kids are going to be able to do.
[160:30.29]It's going to buy me like an hour.
[160:33.63]Walk around for a little bit.
[160:36.21]Here, here's some like foam swords.
[160:37.77]Pretend somebody's a skeleton king.
[160:42.05]This is what you built.
[160:43.39]This is what would be built in a kindergarten class.
[160:55.34]Oh, is that the plot for Billy Madison?
[160:56.98]It isn't.
[160:57.26]I don't know.
[160:57.82]Close.
[161:01.21]Kindergarten stream.
[161:04.17]How did I think this was ever going to work?
[161:07.59]Like, honest to God.
[161:10.97]Turn PVP on, by the way.
[161:14.10]And give me that Skyrim music.
[161:22.60]The stream was just a daycare.
[161:32.69]Recess versus reality.
[161:34.61]That should be the title of this stream.
[161:37.13]Recess versus reality.
[161:48.86]We got PvP on?
[161:57.85]Change title.
[162:06.30]I missed my son's birthday.
[162:09.82]Hey, Nintendo Wii music, you know what that means?
[162:11.64]That means wait for the 2.4 gigahertz connection, which is like actually ends up being on the Wii like 400k down to download an update for your system or to download a game that you know is like 40 megabytes and it's taking like 45 minutes.
[162:35.79]And then they decide, Mario starts to walk by and hit coins with his head.
[162:42.43]And when he gets to the second box with the coins in it, that means you're at 50% downloaded.
[162:49.26]And then when you get to about 75% downloaded, he spams the last coin box until you turn the fucking volume down on your TV.
[162:56.68]You can't just have a bar there that says 10, 20, 30%.
[163:01.24]Why?
[163:07.12]I'm acting like this is happening now.
[163:11.88]That's not currently happening right now.
[163:15.12]PvP on?
[163:16.68]Yup.
[163:17.39]That guy's gone.
[163:20.61]Wait, is he?
[163:42.25]Murderer?
[163:43.35]Murderer?
[163:48.00]What the fuck, what?
[163:51.44]You're gonna visit your kingdom.
[163:53.52]Yeah, you know what, let's take a look around.
[163:55.66]See what people built last time.
[163:59.81]Sorry, I just have to fucking kill people.
[164:01.21]Alright.
[164:06.45]What did you make?
[164:06.97]This guy's person has a fort up here.
[164:13.70]Oh, no, what I just did, okay, what I just did is the equivalent of, like, the dad or, like, the principal or, like, the other teacher coming out and seeing, oh, look, they're doing a little, they're doing a little session where they're pretending to slay the dragon.
[164:25.83]And they're using sticks and pretending they're wands.
[164:29.06]See, in those kids' heads, they have their own headcanon how those wands work.
[164:33.32]If I walk out here with a wand in my hand as like just Principal Dave, and I start waving it around going like blast, blast, blast, blast, power move, power move, power move, power move, power move, power move, power move.
[164:44.55]It's like no, no, you can't do that.
[164:46.13]That's not how it works, it's a three second charge.
[164:48.66]Three second charge, oh, you mean like this?
[164:52.66]No, get out of here.
[164:53.62]Oh, I zapped you.
[164:56.08]No, I zapped you.
[164:57.46]Oh, no you didn't, you missed, I zapped you.
[165:03.71]I'm just ruining their time.
[165:09.35]Is PPP on?
[165:13.59]And then you go full throttle Harry Potter mode.
[165:17.64]You say like, oh, I zapped you.
[165:20.04]Oh, I zapped you and you died.
[165:21.02]No, I didn't.
[165:22.90]I didn't.
[165:23.56]What?
[165:24.10]No, I didn't.
[165:24.98]I'm still alive.
[165:25.96]I'm still praying.
[165:26.78]No, I zapped you.
[165:28.84]You have no life left.
[165:30.34]No, that's...
[165:32.38]What are you talking about, no?
[165:35.66]You lost all your HP.
[165:38.65]No I didn't, I have dad shield.
[165:41.85]Mom!
[165:51.12]Let's go, let's go.
[165:59.14]Dude, I got the fucking dragon sword.
[166:00.62]You don't want to mess with the guy with the dragon sword.
[166:03.67]Loot, dude.
[166:04.73]You think you're going to get away with that?
[166:05.67]You think you're just going to take loot?
[166:07.29]All of it?
[166:08.23]No.
[166:10.36]Who got it?
[166:13.18]Oh, look at the fireman church.
[166:14.64]Alright, cool.
[166:15.10]Let me just...
[166:28.98]There.
[166:30.60]See, it didn't really even kill anybody.
[166:32.44]It's still the worst item in Binding of Isaac.
[166:34.56]Alright, where's the fireman church?
[166:49.20]Where's the church?
[166:51.85]Damn.
[166:52.65]Oh, man.
[166:53.23]No, fuck that.
[166:53.83]You guys may be the most dangerous slide at an amusement park.
[166:59.37]This is such a big water slide.
[167:00.49]This thing would be insane.
[167:01.43]Somebody said pog, diamond, sword.
[167:05.95]I'll take care of this.
[167:09.45]This is kind of fucked up.
[167:19.88]Alright, where is it?
[167:27.84]Where's the Church of Fireman?
[167:32.94]Can we build a pyramid over here?
[167:44.31]Oh, shit.
[167:44.79]Alright, here we go.
[167:45.31]The Church of Fireman.
[167:53.91]Jeremy's going to unban me for $200,000.
[167:57.87]$1200?
[167:57.95]No, you're not getting unbanned.
[168:01.83]Irma finished black and white, too.
[168:07.13]The flower given to Fireman by his wife, Flargal.
[168:18.60]The workbench used by Fireman during the great... Yep.

[168:42.62]It took you like three hours to do that, by the way.
[168:44.64]Make sure that everyone's aware of that.
[168:45.69]It took about three hours.
[168:46.87]And now what's over here?
[168:49.03]Is there more to the Church of Firemen?
[168:54.85]Where's the rest of the tour?

[177:45.87]Really cute little... Minecraft is such a fun game.
[177:57.17]Can I unban that person?
[178:00.60]Can we bring that person back?
[178:02.28]I don't know why I did that.
[178:03.70]Can we bring that person back?
[178:13.53]There's like a look at the log of the last person that I killed.
[178:15.57]Can you bring them back?
[178:19.57]This was like a cute thing they were doing too.
[178:21.27]I just like struck him with lightning and pushed him off the edge of a cliff.
[178:28.84]Holy shit.
[178:32.26]This is something I can't show on stream.
[178:46.51]Get that off stream!
[178:48.37]Get that off camera, dude!
[178:50.21]Get that off, get that off!
[179:01.29]I don't think you can... I mean, that's... I don't know.
[179:05.09]It's like a guy with a clown in his dick.
[179:07.19]What are you... I don't... Can I... I don't think... This is supposed to be like Minecon friendly.
[179:13.09]Wait, you have to say, you have to click mature audience when you click this stream, right?
[179:16.85]Alright, can we, can we take, can we take off his, uh... Oh, come on, dude.
[179:32.95]Come on, man.
[179:34.81]Come on, man.

[179:47.29]This is absolute fucking nonsense.
[179:50.55]Okay.
[179:56.83]Anybody got anything else that we can see?
[179:58.37]Ugh.
[180:08.69]Go read the signs at the church.
[180:10.35]Okay.
[180:11.65]It sounds... Wait, there is actually... It's like a little store here.
[180:15.99]What is this place?
[180:18.65]This looks kind of cool.
[180:27.74]A machine gun was shooting.
[180:31.12]What the fuck was that?
[180:32.46]I just heard a machine gun firing at us.
[180:35.24]What the fuck?
[180:36.76]What was that?
[180:46.11]No, it's not this person.
[180:47.17]That was like... Somebody's shooting!
[180:59.76]What am I hearing?
[181:04.68]Oh, it's this.
[181:06.30]Somebody's opening a door.
[181:16.07]Idiot trap.
[181:17.43]Idiot trap.
[181:18.71]Idiot trap.
[181:28.88]Oh, shit.
[181:29.40]It did work.
[181:30.04]I didn't know.
[181:31.24]I thought it was going to kill you.
[181:37.41]I thought it was going to spin and be like a blender.
[181:39.67]Ooh, what's this?
[181:42.15]Something new.
[181:46.05]Rat dens.
[181:47.67]Okay.
[181:49.01]The Rat King's lair.
[181:53.45]Oh, shit.
[181:55.57]Watch out, watch out, watch out for that, watch out for that.
[181:57.85]Watch out for that, watch out for that.
[182:01.14]It's the Rat King.
[182:05.42]Damn.
[182:05.76]Yeah, give him some gold.
[182:10.90]Is he eating the gold bars?
[182:13.74]What do you got in the back room?
[182:20.11]Lieutenant rat den.
[182:21.11]I think I killed.
[182:24.28]I killed somebody.
[182:24.82]I think I can't right click.
[182:27.74]I think.
[182:28.06]Okay.
[182:28.24]Oh shit.
[182:30.74]Look at this.
[182:31.14]What do you got in here?
[182:32.06]Mr. Rat King.
[182:33.20]Hmm.
[182:36.06]We'll take some of that.
[182:38.40]I mean, no, why not?
[182:48.32]Why?
[182:48.50]Yes.
[182:48.58]Yes.
[182:51.45]Yes, I'm taking it.
[182:52.25]Are you trying to hit me with that?
[182:57.53]Don't forget who has the fucking cigarette of death.
[183:00.49]I do.
[183:00.97]It's this one.
[183:07.03]What do we got back here?
[183:07.71]This is pretty sick.
[183:11.09]Turn off... Turn off PvP, please.
[183:15.87]I'm dying so much.
[183:21.11]I'm sorry, man.
[183:22.21]I'm sorry.
[183:28.51]That was a plea.
[183:32.19]Please.
[183:32.67]Alright, what else we got?
[183:38.28]I'm stuck in the Coliseum.
[183:39.40]How do I... Wait, are you still... Is somebody still in a maze?
[183:43.40]Can somebody check?
[183:44.04]Is somebody still doing the maze?
[183:50.52]That's not real, right?
[183:51.34]Is somebody actually still in there?
[184:00.75]Poor kid.
[184:01.35]Wait, he's in maze 1?
[184:04.39]No.
[184:04.85]No, there's nobody in maze 1, guys.
[184:09.98]He's like... He's like 50 feet into maze 1 and it's like 5 miles long.
[184:18.11]Hey, but guess what?
[184:18.65]He's having a ton of fun.
[184:19.79]He doesn't even know.
[184:21.03]He doesn't even care.
[184:25.37]Maze 1 to this person, guys, that's... That's a lot of content.
[184:31.94]Alright, this is called My House.
[184:40.46]Alright, well, whose house?
[184:42.64]Please read the signs of the church.
[184:43.86]I'll read the signs of the church.
[184:44.78]I will.
[184:46.02]Is this your house?
[184:47.04]Oh, that's Chester the Cheeto.
[184:51.19]Can I turn?
[184:51.61]I want to see your face.
[184:58.33]That's pretty sick, dude.
[185:01.97]That person spit on me.
[185:03.05]Alright.
[185:04.05]L Mushroom.
[185:04.64]What does this say?
[185:06.50]Alright.
[185:08.18]I'm going to go read the signs of the church.
[185:10.14]Pretty cool house, though, man.
[185:11.20]Pretty sick house.
[185:25.20]It's supposed to be windy today, be careful.
[185:33.61]That's a pretty big building though.
[185:36.43]Your goons are ruining the house.
[185:38.11]What do you mean my goons?
[185:41.73]I'm gonna come to the pea shop.
[185:49.01]That's fine.
[185:49.37]That's okay.
[185:50.49]Don't worry.
[185:53.08]Nice work though.
[185:54.80]Good job.
[185:56.10]Oh, dog.
[185:57.12]Dog house.
[185:57.90]Look at this one.
[185:58.62]Holy shit, this is awesome.
[186:02.87]Jeremy is tall.
[186:03.73]No one typed that.
[186:05.17]Yes, they did.
[186:06.31]Whoever made this sign.
[186:07.51]What's in here?
[186:24.52]That's a rat.
[186:26.06]This is so cool.
[186:27.02]Alright, this is cool.
[186:28.72]I'm gonna sneeze, but I cannot mute my microphone.
[186:40.03]That was fucking horrible.
[186:41.81]Oh my god.
[186:47.87]That's the worst thing I've... That's the worst sound I've ever made.
[186:53.22]Oh, that was horrible.
[186:55.96]He was faking it.
[186:57.02]No, I was... Okay, let me... I gotta tell you what happened there.
[187:00.51]That was fucking nuts.
[187:02.97]So... I started to sneeze.
[187:05.61]I don't like when people are looking at me.
[187:06.61]I gotta go somewhere else.
[187:07.99]So when I started to sneeze, I felt it coming.
[187:10.94]And then sometimes if you make noise and you just act weird, you can make it not happen.
[187:15.30]I can't mute the microphone.
[187:17.52]I have no way to mute myself.
[187:20.50]So I have no button to press.
[187:22.91]Because I'm not technically streaming through my computer.
[187:26.25]So, I turned this way and it stopped happening and then I, like, as a joke, like, made another noise.
[187:31.78]Like, oh, it's okay.
[187:32.52]It's not gonna happen.
[187:33.50]And then I made another one after that of real noise.
[187:36.24]And then I sneezed and it hurt.
[187:37.46]I don't know what happened there.
[187:39.82]That was fucking bizarre.
[187:40.94]Alright, let's go to a village.
[187:48.84]When are you gonna stop recording this pre-recorded video for the stream?
[187:54.58]Whatever.
[187:55.34]I don't even know what you're trying to say.
[187:57.50]Hello.
[187:57.82]Hey.
[187:58.12]Welcome to the village.
[188:01.27]You just blew out your septum?
[188:02.55]No.

[188:46.43]You're gonna get like a million messages.
[188:49.85]Right, you're going to get like 5,000 messages a second for the next like three days.
[188:56.21]I'm just saying.
[188:58.33]A dense wall of trees would help keep the village hidden.
[189:01.13]Communal mineshaft.
[189:09.54]Hey, but if you contact him, if you want to be part of the village, then that's what you should be.
[189:13.66]Don't fucking contact him for any other reason.
[189:16.72]I'm getting out the stick of lightning.
[189:17.94]Don't fucking make me use it.
[189:21.29]What was that?
[189:24.87]PlayStation?
[189:27.05]Play... Play Sly Cooper.
[189:33.92]Wait, is this the other way?
[189:36.48]Is it Nightwing?
[189:43.82]Wait, I didn't even see the rest of this village.
[189:55.13]What's in this house?
[190:00.77]Open.
[190:01.21]What do you got?
[190:02.49]Apples.
[190:05.50]I'm stuck out of bounds.
[190:06.76]His cronies have destroyed everything.
[190:09.52]Aren't you all cronies?
[190:12.76]I don't have like a group of people that are like, yeah, yeah, go mess the place up while you're at it.
[190:17.34]Go mess them up.
[190:19.26]Aren't we all cronies in here?
[190:25.69]This is a cool house, though.
[190:26.57]I like the design on this one.
[190:33.22]Statue of King Jerma.
[190:35.42]Oh, nice!
[190:36.60]Is somebody in there?
[190:42.86]No.

[195:35.46]That's really what you have to do?
[195:37.35]I mean, that's a stick, but that's not the right one.
[195:39.35]Anybody have a stick?
[195:42.93]What the fuck is going on here?
[195:44.33]Are you trying to be calling me?
[195:50.95]Yes, this is like Zeus and his son Thor talking to each other.
[195:58.58]That was a weird way to say that.
[196:01.64]Zeus and his son Thor.

[199:47.52]Did I get my answer?
[199:48.36]Did I get my question answered?
[199:56.61]Isn't it over here somewhere?
[200:04.06]Yeah, I need to see the church and I need to see what platform they want me to play Sly Cooper on.
[200:11.98]Play... Tunia?
[200:24.15]Why do you live in this sign?
[200:27.38]Does a guy live in a billboard?
[200:29.02]Play Neptunia.
[200:32.68]This is where I live.
[200:35.93]My house billboard.

[201:05.18]Wait, that's, that's, that's, that's unlucky.
[201:08.32]You don't take somebody else's rabbit's foot.
[201:09.64]That's cursed.
[201:13.83]There you go.
[201:14.23]I should show feet.
[201:15.29]There it is.
[201:18.95]Alright, let's go back to the church.

[202:15.35]What'd I do?
[202:20.56]Alright, so go to the front of the church again.
[202:23.68]It has been changed.
[202:25.76]Quite a bit.
[202:28.86]Yeah.
[202:34.18]Hello, Germs.
[202:35.32]Can't believe Jeremy Craft is real.

[202:39.64]It's gonna have eight signatures.
[202:42.42]Moo Crew Round 2.
[202:44.42]You gotta be this tall to enter.
[202:45.62]No one is that tall, so none of us can go in.
[202:50.96]Does it say play the Age of Mythology OST?
[202:53.94]Put it on.

[203:13.48]Through the jermaFireman and the flames we carry on.
[203:17.00]Jerma, play rock band drums.
[203:20.20]You want to talk about my immersion being broken?

[203:50.80]Is that what's going on right now?
[203:52.32]Well, yeah.
[203:52.62]Excuse me.
[203:53.40]No one's allowed back here.
[203:54.92]So what else is going on?
[204:21.70]Is this, wait, this is a tomb?
[204:28.15]Alright, you're gonna, you're gonna desecrate the grave with Toontown Wen.
[204:41.94]Do you guys remember VH1's pop-up videos?
[204:45.46]It was a TV show.
[204:48.63]And it would play a music video.
[204:51.79]And it would be like... It'd be like Michael Jackson would be dancing on the... And it'd be like... Michael Jackson was born.
[205:01.13]And it'd give you, like, random info and facts about, like, the set.
[205:03.86]About, like, who is the musician or whatever.
[205:07.50]This is just pop-up video of the stream.
[205:10.36]I just keep getting... Hey, Jerma, when are you gonna play Garfield card?
[205:16.44]Jerma's small.
[205:21.56]You know what's really funny?
[205:22.81]I think... I think it's time to hire somebody to, like, do a pop-up video on a video that gets uploaded to, like, the second channel.
[205:33.37]Just have them be fucking horrible.
[205:37.61]We'll do a pop-up video on some upload coming up in the next whatever.
[205:41.76]What's this?
[205:46.34]What's the deal with
[205:50.77]Sterners sign.
[205:52.99]I... What does it say?
[205:55.39]I don't think it's even... I'm glad it's being blocked.
[205:57.91]I think it's just nonsense.
[205:58.79]I pee.
[206:03.93]I forgot.
[206:04.37]They forgot about where they pee or something.
[206:05.79]Whatever.
[206:06.55]Alright, let's go.
[206:06.95]That's it?
[206:12.41]Wait.
[206:13.33]Secret.
[206:19.72]This is a really bad house.
[206:32.88]Don't give me that.
[206:34.44]I'm just saying.
[206:40.45]Is that rude?
[206:41.27]No, it was bad.
[206:41.97]Let me put it this way.
[206:46.27]Incomplete.
[206:47.99]It's a little incomplete.
[206:51.43]I didn't mean to say bad it's just not done toxic you're a psycho no I didn't mean bad in that way I meant bad like as in like man it's bad because you don't this you don't have enough stone to put up I wish you had more stone to use come to the throne room for golden what

[207:18.35]Ayaya, you are really cool, dude.
[207:20.07]We actually love mazes.
[207:21.21]We were joking.
[207:21.87]Best maze stream of 2020.
[207:23.01]This was made by Farmers Guild.
[207:25.25]Play Garfield Kart.
[207:27.21]Thanks.
[207:28.31]For... Uh, alright.
[207:30.47]Read these.
[207:31.25]Hey, thanks, guys.
[207:34.57]I think my favorite part about the stream is, like, guy with the piston dick.
[207:38.41]I mean, that was probably my favorite part.
[207:44.43]I literally put it in your hands.
[207:54.33]What is this?
[207:57.01]Read these.
[207:59.39]Read.
[208:00.21]I'm here.
[208:00.85]I'm reading.
[208:02.07]Read these.
[208:02.85]Jesus Christ.
[208:04.35]I feel like I'm in a nightmare.
[208:05.53]Weren't these the same ones?
[208:07.89]This is the throne room.
[208:21.12]Guards, kill him.
[208:24.42]So it's a mutiny then.
[208:32.15]Just like the emperor.
[208:37.55]Just like this.
[208:46.47]Wrong line.
[208:51.54]I thought that was an Enderman.
[208:52.77]It is, actually, isn't it?
[208:57.13]Alright, I think it's time to can this.
[209:00.23]I think it's time to can this.
[209:04.92]Fly Cooper answer.
[209:15.88]Yeah, where is it?
[209:17.04]I'll answer it.
[209:28.62]End of career stream?
[209:30.44]No.
[209:31.37]No, it wasn't.
[209:32.53]Alright, where's the answer?
[209:41.93]There it is.
[209:42.25]Okay.
[209:43.77]On... Let's see.
[209:54.43]Look at this guy.
[209:55.15]On...
[210:03.73]Where is it?
[210:09.13]Otto?
[210:13.49]Why?
[210:14.01]Did he remove it?
[210:17.12]We're just desperately looking for it.
[210:18.58]Is that it down there?
[210:21.48]No, it was up high, wasn't it?
[210:24.02]Wait.
[210:25.72]What was that?
[210:33.94]by the peaceful village?
[210:37.60]Play Lego Island.
[210:38.52]I mean, that's pretty creative, considering you did it on an island.
[210:51.75]Peter.
[210:53.39]Okay.
[210:55.89]Alright, so, above church on cobblestone.
[210:58.72]Best joke of the whole stream.
[211:02.28]Above church on cobblestone.
[211:03.96]Best joke of whole stream.
[211:07.98]What is it?
[211:13.61]What is it?
[211:15.47]That's cobblestone right here.
[211:16.41]Take the sword.
[211:28.03]Oh, shit.
[211:28.88]Thanks.
[211:32.82]Alright, pick this up.
[211:33.30]I pressed Q too many times.
[211:56.25]Okay, well here's this answer.
[212:01.27]Somebody said it's over here?
[212:02.28]There it is!
[212:08.08]Place Sly Cooper on... P2?
[212:10.04]You didn't even answer.
[212:16.24]Did somebody make this and then leave the server?
[212:24.25]On PC.
[212:27.41]Oh, okay.
[212:27.63]Okay.
[212:30.15]Yeah, dude, sure.
[212:30.95]I mean, I might as well.
[212:37.41]PC.
[212:38.39]Alright, yeah.
[212:39.49]I'll play Sly Cooper on PC.
[212:40.85]I mean, I'm going to answer your question, man.
[212:48.47]Alright.
[212:49.55]I am... Actually, we spent a lot of time just after doing all the random minigames.
[212:59.25]I'm surprised we spent this much time just doing this.
[213:00.83]This has been fun too.
[213:01.77]Play Age of Mythology on PC.
[213:06.02]That's not a bad idea.
[213:06.74]Yeah, it is.
[213:11.88]I'm just seeing if I missed anything over here.
[213:24.09]Murdered.
[213:25.77]Please do not kill me.
[213:30.93]There's nobody here.
[213:31.33]What are you hiding?
[213:42.75]Yeah, what are you hiding?
[213:46.41]You have a little secret base.
[213:47.69]Death.
[213:52.86]Okay, well.
[213:57.66]That's his shitter, dude.
[214:03.22]Far Cry 1, Jerma, we've been waiting for years.
[214:05.00]Alright, I'll play Far Cry 1 on Monday.
[214:11.81]How's that sound?
[214:12.79]You just got Ultimate One Guide.
[214:15.19]You got Ultimate One Guide right there.
[214:17.07]I'm going to play Far Cry 1 on Monday.
[214:18.43]There you go.
[214:25.57]Play on PS2.
[214:26.89]Wait, this was changed.
[214:33.48]Go to the Santa house?
[214:34.68]It says PS2, please.
[214:48.59]Come see my auto statue.
[214:57.34]Alright, I think that's it.
[215:02.54]We had to skip all the lore in the beginning of the stream.
[215:06.18]And it was very hard.
[215:09.48]But it was still fun.
[215:12.12]So here's what's going to happen now.
[215:14.29]This was just a gigantic advertisement stream for this server.
[215:19.53]Fuck the king.
[215:20.53]What?
[215:22.19]Oh.
[215:25.88]The... We're out of space here.
[215:34.21]This server is going to stay on.
[215:37.85]For at least a little while.
[215:39.84]You'll be able to do pretty much what you want.
[215:41.48]You can play through the mini-games if you want again.
[215:44.98]You can just have a little server here.
[215:46.66]Hang out, chill.
[215:53.92]Please come to the Farmer's Guild one more time.
[215:55.88]Alright, one more time at the Farmer's Guild.
[216:06.21]Yeah, so the server is going to be off the next probably couple of hours.
[216:11.64]Because they're going to reconfigure a few things, I guess.
[216:17.32]But it will be on.
[216:18.32]You can just play on it.
[216:25.27]I just immediately thought this was a dick.
[216:27.51]And I didn't even... This is like a space invader thing.
[216:35.64]Is it $40?
[216:36.20]No, it's not $40.
[216:37.94]If you get banned from the server, you can't pay $40 to come back.
[216:41.06]I know that for a fact.
[216:41.82]I've been told that for a fact.
[216:43.75]No, that's not here.
[216:46.05]What is this?
[216:56.17]And we'll probably... It might be fun just to have a place.
[217:00.69]Just like a server.
[217:02.51]Kind of add to this.
[217:03.89]Just for fun.
[217:10.93]It's 50 now.
[217:11.79]No.
[217:11.95]Alright, where was that farm?
[217:15.09]It's the last thing I want to say before we get out of here.
[217:18.47]Thanks for watching, though, guys.
[217:19.43]I mean, it's still sort of experimental, a lot of this stuff.
[217:26.78]But it was still fun, regardless.
[217:30.30]It was still chaotic.
[217:37.20]Save the Colosseum.
[217:39.93]What do you mean, save the Colosseum?
[217:43.79]What's wrong with the Colosseum?
[217:47.55]Get that guy out of the maze.
[217:58.24]I feel so bad for that person.
[218:01.50]What do you mean, save the Colosseum?
[218:05.41]Oh, save the guy from the Colosseum.
[218:07.29]Okay, I will.
[218:10.34]Where is he?

[252:10.73]You just go like this.
[252:11.45]And you zoom way the fuck in and you crop that right there.
[252:14.74]And then you blow it up and you upscale it.
[252:17.26]God, if you see this, spam Sour Towers.

[257:27.82]What's the game?
[257:33.46]Paper Mario for the Nintendo Wii Jira.
[257:48.82]It really was just a game recommendation.

[258:15.19]Okay, let's see.
[258:15.71]Let's see if we're going to ban this person from chat.
[258:19.34]No, it doesn't because I don't know.
[258:20.16]Everyone started doing it.
[258:25.40]I don't even know who you are.
[258:28.30]You're not the only person spamming.
[258:34.00]TP for Farmer's Guild Throne Room.

[258:50.42]Panic Room.
[258:54.38]Okay, yeah.
[258:58.53]Panic.
[258:58.91]Now, I wouldn't want to be in here, don't you know?
[259:01.41]Everyone that thought that was a good idea, playing Survival and Left 4 Dead, you all go in the bathroom.
[259:06.13]Once the tank shows up, you all die.
[259:08.63]Seems like a good idea.
[259:09.55]Good stream, Jermimus.
[259:11.11]Thank you.
[259:14.27]That was the original meta for Left 4 Dead because nobody understood.
[259:18.13]Never scored.
[259:19.43]Jumped from here at the end of stream.
[259:21.23]Saint Moped.
[259:25.01]What?
[259:30.18]Did he just die?
[259:30.98]He just jumped off.
[259:38.60]What the fuck?
[259:40.36]The dude just... literally just jumped off of the castle.
[259:45.12]Why?
[259:45.50]Why did you do that?
[259:48.10]Why did you do that?
[259:51.30]Wrong person, throne room.
[259:52.48]So wait, that person lied?
[259:54.94]He forgot.
[259:55.62]Defend your throne room.

[260:51.64]And stay out.
[260:54.18]How many people died?
[260:54.92]We got rid of them.
[261:00.10]Still wrong person.
[261:00.84]You haven't helped the people stuck in the maze.
[261:02.42]I'm so addicted to this.
[261:07.93]I'm sorry.
[261:08.35]Okay, are we going late?
[261:09.27]Let me ask everybody over here.
[261:10.77]Are we going late here?
[261:11.95]Should I end this?
[261:14.47]I'm addicted to doing this.
[261:20.59]Okay.
[261:22.73]Not easy being the king.
[261:25.61]TP to me, sure.
[261:34.95]You idiot.
[261:36.95]I'm gonna let you live.
[261:39.85]But, you get to live if you, with your bare hands, get us out of here.
[261:47.42]If I see a tool,
[261:52.92]Oh.
[261:54.94]I thought we were like 5,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[261:57.54]Okay.
[261:58.86]Yeah, you're good.
[262:00.26]I thought we were like two miles down near bedrock.
[262:05.21]Okay, let me see.
[262:06.63]To me, to me, you keep confusing the fuck out of me.
[262:11.05]Help Otto.

[262:15.11]Who am I TPing to?
[262:21.95]Farmers get thrown from I'm dying.
[262:23.65]Okay, we'll do that one.
[262:30.84]To the Farmer High Council.
[262:37.20]Okay.
[262:39.01]Nice skin.
[262:41.13]For the High Farmer Lando Brando.
[262:44.25]Yeah, we're a little premature and he died from it.
[262:48.52]A little premature.
[262:50.26]A little premature.
[262:54.74]He tried.
[262:55.64]And then your engineer over there.
[262:57.22]It's okay.
[262:59.75]I'm invincible.
[263:00.51]This is what you wanted so bad?
[263:08.69]Well, no, king.
[263:10.37]False king, by the way.
[263:12.01]Get on in there.
[263:15.01]You're going to be killed by your own contraption.
[263:26.61]Oh, you know what?
[263:30.45]Who did that?
[263:33.61]Come to my house.
[263:34.25]Come to my house.
[263:34.81]Alright.
[263:35.65]Only a few more.
[263:36.15]Can I have a TP, please?
[263:39.15]You never answered my question.
[263:41.00]No, Super Paper Mario.
[263:42.12]I'm not going to play it yet.
[263:44.48]TP to me.
[263:45.02]TP to me.
[263:54.16]Where the hell...
[263:56.78]What did he just do?
[264:00.87]You abandoned me in the maze.
[264:01.99]You... Well, that's how you hide that.
[264:12.34]That's how that gets hidden.
[264:15.90]How did you guys get here?
[264:20.40]This guy made a portal to the nether so he could trap me here.
[264:27.23]Well, it worked.
[264:28.18]And then he jumped into the lava and died.
[264:29.86]EP to Dave Kapp.
[264:36.00]Okay.
[264:49.04]Incredible Marble for iOS comes out October 8th.

[267:18.51]Why?
[267:19.29]Psycho streamer thrown.
[267:20.49]Fuck you, Jerm.
[267:22.25]You abandoned me in a maze for four hours.
[267:24.53]I almost died.
[267:25.05]I was eating dirt and sucking water out of moss and grass.
[267:30.78]You could have just slash die.
[267:32.08]Alright, fine.
[267:33.56]I'll sit on it.
[267:36.32]I'm sitting on it.
[267:38.74]How do I sit on it?
[267:40.22]Is there a way to sit?
[268:05.18]Did he forget where the switch is?
[268:10.99]You're not going to drop me in lava?
[268:17.63]I think he's surprised I'm still here.
[268:47.30]Where'd he go?
[268:59.76]Oh, it's the penis guy's house.
[269:00.76]Okay, yeah.
[269:01.08]I should have killed him.
[269:02.06]Alright, TP.

[269:53.54]I'm going to go back to Jerma985.
[269:56.00]Or, no, apparently we're going to Jerma's son.
[269:58.80]Your father, Jerma, loves you.
[270:00.50]Oh, he wasn't done.
[270:01.32]He was setting it up.
[270:02.20]He wasn't done.
[270:02.94]He wasn't done with his joke.
[270:06.76]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[270:07.80]I went to the wrong Jerma.
[270:11.22]Once upon a time, there was a man named Jeremy.
[270:12.62]Jeremy.
[270:14.24]He's but a humble e-clown playing video games on Twitch.
[270:16.73]One day Jeremy decided to torture his viewers.
[270:19.03]He created hundreds of mazes and forced his viewers to traverse through them.
[270:22.43]It took them years of pain and suffering.
[270:24.45]Play Lego Racers.

[287:43.50]Okay.
[287:44.92]Play TF2 on PC.
[287:46.32]It's a fun class-based shooter with tons of maps and game modes.
[287:48.82]Did I mention it's free?
[287:50.46]Sounds like a kind of cool game.
[287:56.63]Alright.
[288:02.30]Come on, dude.
[288:03.04]My store is dying.
[288:04.24]Here we go.

[288:21.55]Here, you want some iron?
[288:23.25]Take some of this iron.
[288:26.49]So what do you do here?
[288:34.70]Alright, Demon, I'll take PDU to end it.
[288:37.78]End Furfur.
[288:38.76]Demon and Furfur, that's it.
[288:40.50]That's a pretty good piss shop.
[288:47.52]This is my base I made with my new friend, Sorakio.
[288:51.97]He had to leave before the stream started, but I wanted to give him a shout out here.
[288:56.17]Alright, nice.
[288:59.65]Who are you for Halloween?
[289:01.07]Splash?
[289:03.55]What's down here?
[289:10.96]Wrong person?
[289:12.44]That was a wrong person.
[289:14.70]What was the last person's name?
[289:24.09]Wait, why is there a 984 now?
[289:30.24]Sufan, okay.

[289:42.66]Who am I killing?
[289:47.43]Kill him.
[289:48.99]Is somebody behind here?
[289:49.85]Somebody said kill him.
[289:53.13]Jim?
[289:59.18]I told me to kill this guy.

[290:18.65]Yeah, you weren't here when we went to this.
[290:20.97]We've already been here.
[290:22.43]We found this accidentally.
[290:31.55]You're breaking my heart.

[299:43.97]Come read my- Alright, this is it.
[299:45.73]This is the true final one.
[299:48.14]Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode 1 of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[299:51.08]This is going to be a single player Let's Play, and when I say Let's Play, I say that term pretty loosely.
[299:56.54]Because I'm an idiot in this game.
[299:57.70]You're going to see lots of fails, you're going to see lots of triumphs.
[300:00.31]At least I'm hoping so.
[300:01.19]So grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, a hot cup of cocoa.
[300:04.39]I got apple cider right here, freshly brewed.
[300:06.31]Let me take a sip.
[300:07.59]That's good cider.
[300:08.99]Also, love you Jerma, make us genuinely happy.
[300:13.97]Now time to disconnect.
[300:14.91]You thought you could hide?
[300:17.86]You thought you could hide?
[300:18.58]Alright.
[300:24.06]I'll see you guys on Monday for Far Cry 1.
[300:26.06]I did say that.
[300:28.76]Thanks for participating, everybody.
[300:31.22]The server's staying on.
[300:32.73]This has been a giant ad for the server.
[300:34.39]It's not turning off.
[300:35.87]They're gonna close it for a few hours and change a few things.
[300:38.17]They're gonna bring it back.
[300:38.97]The server's just gonna be online.
[300:40.97]This is just a Minecraft server.
[300:42.69]It's just a server.
[300:48.36]So, you can play on it.
[300:51.92]This was a giant ad for this server.
[300:57.74]I got about one guy.
[300:59.03]I did?
[301:05.65]He hates sprite dude.
[301:06.87]Oh shit.
[301:07.35]What are you guys doing?
[301:24.02]I think I caught them in the middle of something.
[301:26.80]Hey, that's my stream.
[301:27.64]You want to help?
[301:29.59]Alright.
[301:29.83]I don't know what we're doing, but I guess I'm going to help.
[301:43.07]Yeah, we can edit here.
[301:44.11]Let me just... Yeah, so I'm talking to... I'm not talking to chat right now.
[301:49.95]I'm talking to somebody else.
[301:53.14]So when this turns off in what, like a few hours maybe?
[302:02.29]Will it be able to be joined again?
[302:09.08]Yeah, so in a couple of hours this is going to turn back on and it's just going to be available.
[302:13.02]I'll probably check back in with the server just to see what you guys have done.
[302:18.07]Sort of similar to what we just did right now.
[302:21.46]That was fun.
[302:22.14]That was actually really fun.
[302:23.52]Just going around seeing the weird shit people made.
[302:24.96]So I'll see you guys again on Monday.
[302:30.40]I'm going to play Far Cry 1.
[302:31.51]I guess for some reason.
[302:41.35]On stream or your own time?
[302:43.67]I don't know.
[302:44.70]Yeah, on stream I would assume.
[302:46.68]I'm going to play it on stream.
[302:48.60]I'll have a backup in case I don't want to play it anymore.
[303:02.22]raid raw is raw streaming right now is Ross actually live right now yes yes yes alright let's uh let's let's raid Ross we played with Ross
[303:20.93]In the Phasmophobia stream.
[303:25.79]And they are... What are they doing?
[303:32.59]This is Late Night Among Us.
[303:37.21]I feel like I probably would really like this game.
[303:38.87]I... But... I... Dwill I?
[303:40.79]I would probably hate it.
[303:46.55]I would like it in theory.
[303:50.70]But yeah, let's go show Rossum love that we actually played with them.
[303:54.92]And it was a lot of fun, so.
[303:59.96]Let me... Because I need to be... Am I logged into my Twitch?
[304:04.64]Let me see if I can do this.
[304:05.50]Before you guys kill the stream.
[304:07.08]Because I am not streaming right now, guys.
[304:10.58]Weirdly enough, this is a remote thing because we have people working cameras and stuff, so it's going to be impossible.
[304:17.30]So let me do this.
[304:24.59]Raid.
[304:25.03]Is that gonna work?
[304:29.01]It should, yeah.
[304:29.53]Alright, thanks for watching, everybody.
[304:36.00]We'll see ya.
[304:40.44]That was me on the computer.
[304:41.50]That was me.
[304:42.66]I grew a beard.
[304:47.34]Shared hallucination.
[304:49.88]It was something.
[304:50.52]It was a real fucking... That was a real something.
