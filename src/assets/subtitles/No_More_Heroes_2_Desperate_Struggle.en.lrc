[00:48.36]Don't.

[00:52.65]No, not right off the bat.
[01:00.66]Okay, I gotta relax Hey, what's going on?
[01:07.76]Did you order me?
[01:08.62]Jerma985?
[01:10.67]Oh my god No, it's it's me coming to your birthday fuck I can't oh well today
[01:27.88]Today we're going to play No More Heroes 2, one I've been putting off for a long time.
[01:35.20]When did I play No More Heroes 1?
[01:36.44]Anybody know?
[01:42.36]I said I was going to play this probably 200 or 300 times.
[01:47.19]Since about three months ago, yeah.
[01:50.15]This has been the game I said was going to happen next week for three months.
[01:55.35]So I'm playing it.
[01:58.15]Here we are.
[01:58.61]That's based.
[02:05.18]Veto this shit.
[02:07.22]No, if I was going to veto it, I would have vetoed... No, you can't... Not everything in this stream is a veto.
[02:15.18]You guys get one... Make the streamer angry enough to turn his stream off once every six months.
[02:22.93]That's not happening today.
[02:29.60]Beautiful Joe.
[02:30.82]I got Beautiful Joe 2 back here.
[02:32.22]What am I going to do with it?
[02:32.93]I'm going to have to display it on the shelf.
[02:39.29]But yeah, let's get started.
[02:40.37]This is No More Heroes 2.
[02:41.99]Welcome to a new week.
[02:46.26]Hope you had a good weekend.
[02:48.42]We should be live here Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[02:56.00]Alright, for a second I saw, I thought I saw Kim's name go by.
[02:59.50]Doing Jerma Walk.
[03:01.18]Jerma Walk.
[03:02.61]And something about the Drew crew.
[03:03.75]I was like, I don't even know, I don't think she even knows what that is.
[03:05.99]I was going to say, what the hell?
[03:07.27]How?
[03:08.03]That quickly?
[03:08.69]Like, why is Kim doing the Jerma Walk?
[03:15.66]Anyways, let's get started.
[03:16.40]This is No More Heroes 2.
[03:17.68]Welcome.
[03:18.96]We're going to play.
[03:21.38]I love this game.
[03:22.30]I don't actually remember this game as much as I remember the first one.
[03:26.33]I very vividly remember almost the whole first game.
[03:30.15]Not this one.
[03:32.41]Let's see.
[03:34.25]Give it a look.
[03:41.77]The music is good.
[03:42.61]Yes.
[03:42.97]Oh, I know.
[03:44.63]Should we watch the opening cutscene?
[03:48.47]Or should I just skip it?
[03:57.08]Don't ever skip.
[03:57.96]Colonel.
[03:59.80]But shadows from the wilder days still linger.
[04:24.51]or grandpa a man who slashed his way to the top then walked away has become an urban legend many even doubt was real here the strong devour the weak the weak kneel before the strong and those who wield true power watch and count their gold
[04:44.77]When's the third game coming out?
[04:45.55]And in this mass-produced savagery, one truth is constant.
[04:49.03]It's here, right?
[04:49.59]With each shattered life, the same vow is uttered.
[04:53.06]I will have revenge.
[04:55.44]Tomorrow.
[04:56.60]And no assassin can ever walk away from that.
[04:59.72]He must draw his beam and stand against the madness.
[05:04.58]This is Travis Touchdown's Desperate Struggle.
[05:09.08]Hold it, you violence-loving bastards.
[05:13.26]Travis, I already did.
[05:24.12]What I did before the stream turned on.
[05:29.86]Oh, I saved my game at the beginning of the stream.
[05:31.64]What happens... Do I have to start back at the beginning again?
[05:35.00]Holy shit, saving in real life would suck.
[05:52.57]Why?
[05:54.17]Yes, it would.
[05:54.57]Because then you would just second guess literally everything you've ever done.
[06:00.54]You would have so many save files in your brain back to when you were fucking 14.
[06:06.46]Should I pick the french fries?
[06:07.92]Or should I pick the casserole?
[06:12.34]Let me save it here first.
[06:14.40]And half these people wouldn't delete their saves.
[06:15.72]You would accidentally load a save in your 40s that was from you when you were 17.
[06:21.14]And you just fucking wake up and like your 7, 18 year old, 16 year old, whatever body just like... But no, but you wouldn't even remember anything.
[06:29.65]Right, because that's how I save a work, right?
[06:32.93]You wouldn't remember the forward.
[06:34.07]You would just be screaming knowing you were going back.
[06:39.43]You'd hit the button and go back to like 14 and be like... Teenage me.
[06:48.79]I can't pick... I'm not going to sweep.
[06:54.98]I'll never forget quick load accidentally at night for the first time in 120 years Snow fell on Santa destroy It was a sign nice fetish Another change both beautiful and deadly making a shitload of save files in your head is what?
[07:26.16]Yeah, you guys would not want that.
[07:29.68]You would retake your driver's test a thousand times to make sure you got an S rating on it.
[07:35.69]You know, think of everything you've ever done and how many times you've gone back to save points to fix even, even like the smallest thing.
[07:43.21]I didn't do that good enough.
[07:44.05]I'm gonna restart that.
[07:44.85]I could get like 10 more EXP.
[07:46.03]It's called fashionably late fuckface.
[07:53.87]travis touchdown this place bring back any memories it's only where my last killing spree started all those screwed up fights now why would I remember that it'll be your blood this time when I avenge my brother draw that's a cool weapon who don't you remember the man you fought here
[08:19.44]Um, no.
[08:21.08]Can't say I do.
[08:22.64]Guess he didn't make an impression.
[08:24.00]Must have been crazy weak.
[08:26.67]You insensitive prick!
[08:29.05]You killed him and you don't even remember!
[08:31.55]You know how humiliating that is?
[08:35.67]Sorry.
[08:38.73]Let's go.
[08:39.13]It's been too long, Travis.
[08:40.35]Here we go.
[08:40.59]High strike.
[08:40.99]Low strike.
[09:09.38]I like the scenery.
[09:17.46]B is high strike attack.
[09:20.50]Upward dump.
[09:30.43]Z is lock on, right?
[09:34.89]Beam katana recharge.
[09:35.75]You shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.
[09:40.83]I don't think I need it right now.
[09:43.27]Okay, emergency add is a dodge.
[09:45.75]Why's it not doing anything?
[09:50.01]Good!
[09:51.83]Oh, yes.
[09:53.18]Now I remember how much fun it was.
[09:58.52]Charge slash.
[10:05.48]Swing the Wiimote while running is a running slash.
[10:07.68]Yep.
[10:11.14]This guy sucks.
[10:16.83]Reset the camera.
[10:19.01]Oh, the battery's on the other side.
[10:22.73]Right, right, right, right, right.
[10:26.01]Button mashing.
[10:26.85]Recover from takedown.
[10:28.47]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10:32.09]Get it up!
[10:33.65]It takes so much longer in this one!
[10:35.13]What?! !
[10:39.62]Oh my god.
[10:40.92]It takes forever.
[10:41.86]I don't remember it taking that long.
[10:46.80]Press B. When you're down enemy, yeah, you go stars.
[10:57.04]Duplex.
[10:58.18]Argh!
[11:09.09]Just reload your save, Sy.
[11:10.44]You know how many times I would restart streams?
[11:14.00]Guys, think about how many times you've taken a Photoshop of my face, or taken a screenshot of my face.
[11:20.83]I would have just, I would have like every five minutes a quick save.
[11:24.65]It would take me like six hours to stream three hours.
[11:33.19]But then you'd be kind of boring though, wouldn't I?
[11:36.41]If I went back and corrected every dumb thing I've ever said on every stream, I would just kind of just... Your experience would just kind of be like this.
[11:47.38]There's a door.
[11:49.02]Number 13.
[11:54.40]Excellent choice.
[11:54.98]Oh, there's a guy over here on the right.
[12:09.48]Stream scumming.
[12:14.75]Oh god, it's him.
[12:15.45]Yeah.
[12:35.64]Get rid of that cigarette.
[12:37.32]By the way, what's with the filter on that cigarette?
[12:38.93]It's half the cigarette.
[12:42.47]So what should I tell you this time?
[12:45.47]Oh, it was snowing today.
[12:47.87]Extra filter.
[12:48.67]It means it's less bad for you.
[12:51.61]I'll never forget.
[12:52.45]At night, for the first time... At some point, someone's getting ripped off paying for filters.
[12:58.65]Snow fell on Santa Destroy.
[13:00.68]It was a sign...
[13:04.50]another change both beautiful and deadly was coming blanketed in white the city never looked so beautiful this is me on the phone so pristine nice porn game that's it's a dumb cut scene white turned to red and he lost his mind
[13:35.13]Oh, King of Spades.
[13:38.33]Oh, we're still going.
[13:39.19]Ooh, you got a guffa gun.
[13:46.29]Here's a gun.
[13:56.16]Do it!
[13:59.00]Oh shit, that sounds like a stream skunk.
[14:01.96]That did kind of sound like a stream skunk.
[14:04.66]I already did it.
[14:06.12]What you guys don't know is I've lost this fight 35 times in a row.
[14:11.39]But you'll never know because I've just been stream scumming.
[14:14.33]Remember that time that I beat all those Dark Souls bosses on the first try?
[14:21.21]Nope.
[14:22.09]Those were 200 and 300 attempts.
[14:26.75]But I have to make it believable.
[14:28.81]So I have to lose a bunch on some of them and then scream scum half of them.
[14:32.19]So then you think I'm like, okay.
[14:46.84]There goes his head.
[14:51.74]That was Jevil.
[14:55.23]It landed right then.
[14:57.53]Skelter Helter.
[15:00.06]Dead.
[15:02.50]Somebody gave a hundred bucks at the beginning of this.
[15:05.12]I'd like to address it.
[15:08.12]Right after this cuts in.
[15:08.78]Oh, it's this lady again.
[15:28.92]So you finally resumed work as an assassin, and still a hygiene-impaired slob, I see.
[15:37.49]Sylvia.
[15:39.25]Is that it?
[15:41.07]You gotta be kidding.
[15:42.83]I haven't seen you in three years, and that's the welcome I get?
[15:45.80]How much content on everything that's happened since the last game?
[15:50.38]We're not gonna be satisfied until you do, right?
[15:54.96]Oh, give me a break.
[15:56.36]We're gonna get a recap.
[15:56.98]There are people starting from the sequel who don't care about continuity, you know?
[16:02.60]Besides, it would take forever if I recapped every detail of your fall from greatness.
[16:08.60]Players would skip it.
[16:10.08]It's so boring.
[16:12.14]Well, I guess you got a point there.
[16:15.92]Yeah, that's what I do.
[16:19.19]Now, may I?
[16:20.59]This man was the 51st ranked assassin.
[16:23.65]Since you've killed him, that officially makes you 51st.
[16:27.57]And that means you are qualified to fight in the ranking battles again.
[16:32.13]So, how about it?
[16:33.86]If you're a real man, you'll do anything to climb back on top.
[16:37.74]Because, trust me, the view is still very satisfying.
[16:42.70]Hold on.
[16:43.82]Why would I have to start from rank 51 this time?
[16:47.25]More competition.
[16:48.77]The last game's success made assassination trendy.
[16:52.11]Yeah, but I already fought my way to number one before.
[16:55.96]Shouldn't I get a special fast track to the title fight?
[16:59.58]No, but you will get a special prize.
[17:03.55]Shut up.
[17:06.92]You can't bribe me this time.
[17:08.76]I've already tasted those goods.
[17:11.18]But just a taste.
[17:12.50]This time, you'll get the five-course meal.
[17:16.50]Five-course?
[17:19.02]Wait, I don't get what that means.
[17:21.60]Did you know I am a yoga master?
[17:26.63]You don't say?
[17:30.11]Are you familiar with any yoga positions?
[17:33.31]Like a downward dog?
[17:36.11]The dog can do all sorts of things.
[17:38.75]So can the cobra, the rabbit.
[17:41.53]Cobra?
[17:41.91]The rat?
[17:42.65]The rabbit?
[17:43.73]The rat?
[17:45.26]Oh, hold on.
[17:46.18]Oh, yeah.
[17:49.36]I'm in it to win, baby.
[17:50.92]Number one, here I come.
[17:59.70]Wait, he's still alive?
[18:00.49]I've got a message for you.
[18:04.65]Oh my, he's still alive.
[18:07.69]Pain in my ass.
[18:08.79]Why aren't you dead yet?
[18:10.27]Such blind arrogance.
[18:12.29]Like the naked emperor.
[18:13.95]Seriously?
[18:15.17]I cut off your head?
[18:16.45]Travis!
[18:17.74]You are the loser.
[18:19.64]This fight was only part of our plan.
[18:22.70]Our plan?
[18:23.86]I said I'd avenge you killing my brother, didn't I?
[18:27.14]Well, who's been a brother to you?
[18:29.38]What?
[18:29.86]Travis.
[18:31.46]Don't think you can kill without suffering consequences.
[18:35.71]To kill someone is not simply to end their life.
[18:39.77]One must risk their entire being in order to destroy another's.
[18:45.47]Up until now, you've had it easy.
[18:48.58]I'd love for there to be another camera shot of the cameraman down here during this just spinning around in circles with a fucking camera.
[18:55.96]Now it's your turn to be burdened with another's death.
[19:00.39]it has destroyed me and it will destroy you too this is the ultimate vengeance that ruins the illusion yeah it's supposed to porn and gore
[19:33.78]Yeah, they like stab each other and cut each other's faces.
[19:38.00]There's gonna be some blood.
[19:38.96]There's no porn here, though.
[19:42.47]That part, you're wrong.
[19:47.91]Yeah.
[19:48.03]Where the fuck is Super Mario Kart?
[20:02.69]You never have fucking copies of this shit.
[20:06.89]Nah.
[20:08.31]We're just here to collect.
[20:11.57]Travis.
[20:13.53]You got like 20 Maddens.
[20:16.73]But only four?
[20:20.09]You guys could do better than that.
[20:26.35]Madden 0- Madden 96.
[20:29.87]What the fuck just happened?
[20:40.20]That was always such a pain in the ass, though.
[20:42.98]You'd go to a place like Blockbuster, and... They have the same game that nobody wants.
[20:48.88]Taken up two full shelves.
[20:51.70]And they're all in there.
[20:53.08]There's not one that's taken.
[20:54.46]Not one's been rented out.
[20:56.32]And you're just like, wait, come on.
[20:58.02]You can't give me more of these that are being actually rented?
[21:00.58]Is this a Scott Pilgrim game?
[21:07.25]Um... Uh...
[21:11.96]Alright.
[21:18.17]Are you saying that because there's retro video game beep sounds?
[21:26.59]Hey, you can tell when this is going out of style.
[21:30.13]Like, right now.
[21:31.23]When you start seeing this shit in car commercials.
[21:34.73]And insurance commercials.
[21:36.05]How many times have you heard the, like, regular Nintendo sound?
[21:42.37]That's how you can tell it.
[21:43.07]Oh, wait.
[21:43.41]Oh, we got it.
[21:43.99]This is going in style.
[21:46.53]TurboTax.
[21:51.93]You guys, you never heard that before?
[21:53.25]You haven't seen that in... I've seen it.
[22:04.32]I haven't seen a commercial in years.
[22:27.31]He gets a notification on his phone from Amazon.
[22:30.94]Your package has been delivered.
[22:36.56]There's a photo to prove it.
[22:37.58]It's just your shattered fucking window.
[22:59.90]The heavenly dust returned to its maker, leaving in its place a blanket of sadness that covered Santa destroy.
[23:09.09]Then the sun returned, and with it, deafening gunfire and cranking swords, the battles had resumed.
[23:21.64]demons disguised as men running wild in an orgy of ultra violence as if to purge their souls of the hatred that blighted them a lot of cigarettes put out over there see she's got to smoke way more because the filters are too big I have set up the next ranking fight where are you I don't care who the it is just give me someone to fight
[23:51.32]You sound passionate.
[23:53.02]What's gotten into you?
[23:54.16]Put subtitles on?
[23:55.40]Someone kill Bishop.
[23:57.76]I understand.
[23:58.74]I will if I, you know, can.
[24:00.26]Wait for me at Burger Suplex.
[24:05.60]Remember, you have a girlfriend.
[24:06.62]Why are you playing this?
[24:10.19]Wait, you mean like why am I streaming when I have a girlfriend?
[24:13.25]What are you talking about?
[24:19.75]Do I have any shirts?
[24:25.14]I do.
[24:25.56]Okay, let's get some good clothes.
[24:33.67]I can't see it because of the jacket.
[24:34.85]I don't know what that is.
[24:38.93]Okay.
[24:39.33]I want a different jacket.
[24:43.16]Shit, I'm going to have to buy it.
[24:47.98]Is this the only pants?
[24:49.62]Yep.
[24:49.74]Yeah, this is the only everything.
[24:52.54]Okay.
[24:55.27]the volume up.
[24:57.91]Okay.
[24:59.21]There you go.
[25:00.45]You should be able to hear sounds.
[25:06.38]Perfect.
[25:07.24]That's way too loud.
[25:11.86]That was a... Yeah.
[25:12.84]I put it back down where it was.
[25:14.36]Sorry, one guy.
[25:15.16]Okay.
[25:20.03]Hold on.
[25:20.29]This is important.
[25:20.93]Is that a Reddit shelf over there?
[25:34.36]That doesn't count.
[25:38.59]This is a Reddit show.
[25:41.81]So what's the difference between... This is what you would consider... No, it's not?
[25:45.98]How am I saying no?
[25:59.86]Jean's getting way too fat.
[26:01.40]Try to get her to lose some weight.
[26:03.32]Making Jean go on a diet will put her in a foul mood.
[26:08.27]Dieting in a bad mood will lower the effectiveness of the diet.
[26:11.87]Give her a snack from time to time.
[26:14.57]Jean doesn't like doing the same things over and over, so once a menu has been selected, it won't be available for a while.
[26:20.14]Okay.
[26:21.40]24... 24 pounds!
[26:22.92]Alright, let's do some jumping.

[57:05.55]I'm stuck in here.
[57:06.43]How do I do this?
[57:07.31]I need another set of hands.
[57:08.93]I need somebody else's hands.
[57:10.51]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[57:11.83]I forgot.
[57:12.17]I can just take the wall down.
[57:13.03]Okay, we're good, good, good, good, good.
[57:20.08]Hey, look at that.
[57:22.20]I did it.
[57:22.60]I used every single piece.
[57:33.39]Holy shit, his fucking brain.

[58:09.37]Oh, it's already here.
[58:10.01]It's already here.
[58:10.41]It's already there.
[58:10.79]It's already there.
[58:11.19]It's already there.
[58:11.59]It's already there.
[58:15.91]And then... And then we gotta go... This, I guess.
[58:39.33]Like this.
[58:40.75]Like this way, and then that way.
[58:48.26]And then check this out.
[58:49.46]Other way?
[58:50.58]It's too fucking late now.
[59:08.93]It's too late.
[59:13.33]This is what I'm working with.
[59:16.25]And then we go... like this?
[59:17.63]I- I- How did I- What are you talking about?
[59:21.56]I fucked it?
[59:22.02]What are you talking about?
[59:22.72]How is it fucked?
[59:23.98]What are you talking about?
[59:26.14]How?
[59:30.12]How is this fucked?
[59:33.17]How is this fucked up?
[59:38.32]It's fine.
[59:40.96]Then this goes up.
[59:46.06]All the way through here.
[59:46.83]Yeah, how is this fucked up?
[59:50.93]This is correct.
[59:51.93]I did it right.
[59:52.59]Oh, look at all these naysayers.
[59:56.89]Okay.
[60:09.47]Everybody said I blew it.
[60:14.84]Chat's actually the dumb one.
[60:16.68]Really?
[60:24.97]Okay, I think I call it here, right?
[60:27.09]That's $25,000.
[60:27.37]I'm done.
[60:27.73]If I lose, I lose it all.
[60:28.83]Good.
[60:40.77]Okay.
[60:42.57]Let's go to the gym.
[60:47.62]Oh yeah, I gotta get the cat food.
[60:54.24]Okay, let's do our first training.
[60:55.71]I haven't even played one mission yet, and I'm just- this is fun.
[61:00.25]Uh, stamina.
[61:00.59]How much money do I have?
[61:01.41]71,000.
[61:01.43]Stamina.
[61:01.81]Yes, I'm ready.
[61:02.15]Ready, set, go!
[61:23.70]Oh, this is cool.
[61:29.14]What happened?
[61:39.01]Run off the treadmill?
[61:42.31]Turn it on, man.
[61:43.98]You don't say three, two, one, go, and then tell me you're going to turn it on and just don't.
[61:49.49]I was of the opinion that I had to outrun the treadmill thing because of how fast it was going to be going at cartoon speeds.
[61:57.05]Can I just lose $2,000?
[62:04.74]I ran the wrong way?
[62:05.84]Wait, why am I facing this way?
[62:08.74]What are you talking about?
[62:12.88]Oh.
[62:13.00]I didn't think you could change a treadmill's direction.
[62:20.38]I thought those things in the bottom were just LEDs.
[62:22.72]Make it look cool.
[62:34.25]Do it faster.
[62:35.05]No, why?
[62:46.23]Gwe- Somebody said gwe- Gwe- Gwebrain?
[62:51.60]Stamina increased.
[62:52.39]Okay, what's that one?
[63:01.93]Muscle.
[63:03.84]How fast can I tap the button?
[63:07.88]Up with the control stick.
[63:08.82]Let's do it.
[63:09.30]Was there a jump?
[63:16.35]I didn't look.
[63:22.11]Wait, how... How am I not ducking?
[63:24.87]Wait, how are these hitting me in the fucking head?
[63:28.99]Oh, I thought... Wait, what?
[63:34.20]I didn't want to catch his kisses?
[63:38.58]Catching with my brain.
[63:40.64]I'm getting hit by dumbbells.
[63:43.36]I thought I had to duck.
[63:52.27]Hey, Nearshu, thanks for the five communities.
[63:57.03]Yeah, use your forehead to block the weights.
[63:59.38]Is this Happy Gilmore?

[65:02.93]It's not all about violence.
[65:07.23]God, some of you guys only care about the violence.
[65:09.63]Alright, we've done everything.
[65:19.16]Let's go back to the motel.
[65:21.89]Because I'm going to feed the cat.
[65:23.57]Otherwise, this whole chat is going to revolt against me.
[65:26.51]And I won't... I will not be able to stream ever again.
[65:28.53]Because I didn't feed the cat.
[65:33.73]Alright, feed.
[65:39.98]Premium quality cat food.
[65:44.18]Only the best.
[65:44.82]See?

[66:00.04]That's why the cat is fat.
[66:03.50]But we can maintain.
[66:04.57]We can maintain.
[66:05.41]Alright, here we go.
[66:08.75]Wait.
[66:12.05]There's so much to do.

[66:20.34]I'm gonna play the first mission of the game.
[66:22.82]It's been an hour.
[66:23.76]Travis effing touchdown.
[66:28.10]I haven't seen you since my last door was closed.
[66:30.14]Take your time.
[66:33.15]Alright, I want a new jacket.
[66:34.31]I don't want to be default Travis touchdown.
[66:40.83]What?
[66:44.23]This is a different style.
[66:45.59]I don't want this one.
[66:49.86]New old school.
[66:52.48]I need different pants.
[66:56.60]I don't like these.
[66:59.42]What?
[67:02.42]Never mind.
[67:04.60]Dude, you gotta check on your disk, bro.
[67:13.09]I think it's stuck.
[67:15.39]Oh, hit the top of your city player.
[67:23.49]okay that just like reminded me there was this one time where when I was in college where there was somebody in in in the dormitories right everyone we all shared space right it was it was a line of doors and we lived with somebody maybe you had a roommate maybe you didn't maybe you had a solo room whatever um but on my on my area where I lived on campus
[67:50.74]one time this dude had it just he left his room he always listened to music very loudly and he left this room one day and the door obviously locking his door and left his music on like blaring really loud but the problem was the cd or something got stuck so it was just going just over and over for like 30 straight minutes
[68:20.73]Until, like, the building manager had to come and, like, and fucking open his door.
[68:26.50]Because he was gone for, like, four hours at that point.
[68:28.62]And it was, everyone was just like, this is driving us fucking crazy!
[68:35.97]Like, the campus, like, police had to, like, get involved.
[68:42.43]It was fucking insane.
[68:46.36]Where's the video of that?
[68:51.51]I don't remember recording of this.
[68:57.44]But I just remember laughing my ass off.
[69:00.33]I mean, it was really fucking annoying, but at the same time, it was so funny.
[69:07.88]Because it's, like, what do you do?
[69:24.18]It's like a locked door.
[69:25.44]What the fuck are you doing, man?
[69:32.53]Ooh, new music.
[69:35.91]Now I can't stop thinking about it.
[69:37.07]I can't stop thinking about me sitting there and how funny I thought this was.
[69:40.73]C or 2.
[69:40.85]Switch target.
[69:50.88]Kinda hard to do that.
[69:51.50]Go!
[69:52.56]You fuckin' asshole!
[69:59.04]You fuckin' asshole!
[70:00.48]Ah, I missed it.
[70:02.06]The tiger on the bottom right of the screen is the ecstasy gauge.
[70:05.66]Your gauge will increase each time you attack an enemy.
[70:08.62]Your gauge will decrease each time you get hit.
[70:11.18]When your gauge goes up and the tiger turns red, you can connect your slash combos longer.
[70:18.56]You can activate the high-speed slash attack mode by pressing the minus key.
[70:24.88]Okay.
[70:27.33]Here's the twist, let's look at the blood.
[70:36.45]Still here?
[70:47.95]You get what you're looking for?
[70:51.34]Shit.

[70:55.06]Yeah, I know.
[70:55.52]It's Pog, huh?
[70:56.74]How do you even see it?
[71:06.07]Am I just holding the button wrong?
[71:12.81]Oh, you can turn into the tiger.
[71:15.67]Holy shit, I forgot about this.
[71:22.09]Kill everyone.
[71:27.04]Oh, letter grade?
[71:27.70]This is not a... This is not a car.
[71:33.60]This is awesome.
[71:42.01]It's basically a car.
[71:43.13]Well, I mean, it kind of...
[71:52.30]to see gauge increased.
[71:55.78]Money.
[72:00.74]I like this song, too.
[72:01.84]I like this music.
[72:04.43]Alright, let's go.
[72:11.25]It's the title theme.
[72:12.17]Alright, I have a superpower.
[72:15.11]Okay.

[72:41.01]Stop!
[72:41.45]Back it up!
[72:41.91]I'm, like, blocking this without looking.
[72:51.27]Did they even say that in this game?
[72:59.55]They have to, right?
[73:02.21]There's no way they don't.

[73:48.46]He has a fantastic screaming voice.
[73:51.21]There's just so much behind him.
[74:09.72]I carved that fucking guy up.
[74:14.28]Battery?
[74:21.91]Wait.

[75:25.01]Very talented.
[75:25.65]Very, very, very good at what they do.
[75:27.77]Why are we here?
[75:49.29]Come on, I need three in a row.
[75:50.89]I'm not satisfied without three.
[75:52.15]Hey, what you got there?
[75:57.34]It really is too bad.
[76:19.87]There's no more.

[77:47.66]I came to the determination that I don't think so.
[77:51.18]Not, no.
[77:51.82]I was thinking about it, though.

[88:02.12]$50. $50.
[88:09.28]Jeremiah, I just got a big ass unemployment check, so I figured I'd stimulate the economy.
[88:13.48]Go get yourself some McChickens.
[88:14.68]You were spectacular.
[88:16.56]Better hurry.
[88:17.50]You think?
[88:17.83]Like you said, I don't want anybody getting to that bat bastard first.
[88:22.21]When are you gonna do Rat Movie 3?
[88:23.77]I don't know.
[88:26.01]Tomorrow?
[88:27.45]Never?
[88:28.23]Somewhere between there.
[88:29.03]Nothing's gonna hold me back.
[88:30.92]Good.
[88:31.64]I'll arrange the next fight.
[88:33.76]It's going to blow your mind.
[88:36.02]Can't fucking wait.
[88:46.48]Dude, the jobs are not fun.
[89:01.60]Rat Movie 3 date confirmed.
[89:02.72]You heard it here first, guys.
[89:03.70]Spread the news.
[89:05.12]Yeah, it'll be somewhere between tomorrow and the day that I die.
[89:13.08]Hopefully somewhere in the low hundreds.
[89:18.69]I'm really shooting for 110 to 120.
[89:21.21]Cool.
[89:21.39]You're not going to make it to 80, man.
[89:38.52]Try this.
[89:43.60]It's you.
[89:45.04]Who am I killing?
[89:47.13]You'll see.
[89:48.35]It's definitely going to be unusual.
[89:51.39]Come to my office.
[89:52.41]I have forwarded the directions to your map.
[89:54.67]I'm busy, so hurry up.
[89:58.43]Gotcha.
[90:07.20]Okay.
[90:09.30]Oh, it happened again.
[90:10.16]It's a spell joke.
[90:11.80]Fuck.
[90:18.85]What's on the shelf?
[90:22.63]Oh, we've already seen that.
[90:23.57]Another $50 just came in.
[90:27.55]Watch the anime.
[90:29.01]I got a backlog of animes to watch.
[90:30.83]I'll watch it eventually.
[90:33.69]A one true roadie thanks to the $50.
[90:35.61]I haven't been able to catch many streams lately.
[90:43.36]Landing my dream job.
[90:44.86]I'm a full-time mechanic.
[90:47.94]That's fucking awesome.
[90:50.24]Thanks for the near decade of laughs and many more to come.
[90:52.96]If you ever play Monster Hunter: World with the Iceborne expansion, that's something I'd love to see.
[90:58.98]Uh... I probably won't.
[91:01.69]I haven't played any Iceborne.
[91:02.99]I haven't played any Monster Hunter: World for... It's been like at least seven or eight months.
[91:10.43]It's a great game.
[91:11.29]I beat it.
[91:11.95]I completed it.
[91:12.83]I went through the next couple of small things after the final.
[91:15.90]And that's not alright.
[91:19.21]That's what the cat was seeing when it was being shook back and forth.
[91:26.25]No, thanks for the huge money.
[91:27.89]There's lots of back-to-back-to-back money right now.
[91:32.16]Guys, spoil the fuck out of it.
[91:36.76]We can do sorting algorithm awful sound effects.
[91:42.52]Uh, no.
[91:44.46]Coconut grabber!
[91:49.98]Oh wait, pizza!
[91:51.02]Wait!
[91:52.22]Oh, pizza!
[91:53.64]Wait, hold on.
[91:55.95]I gotta feed the cat.
[92:01.89]Okay.
[92:03.01]How many?
[92:03.39]I gotta... One's in chat.
[92:05.81]If you prefer a plain cheese pizza.
[92:20.31]Okay.
[92:21.17]Now let's play.
[92:22.47]At least pepperoni?
[92:26.64]Yep.
[92:28.26]Yep.
[92:30.46]Okay, how many of you guys, um, enjoy, like, for instance, like, a margarita pizza?
[92:37.68]It's the only difference.
[92:38.54]A margarita pizza really is just like a cheese pizza.
[92:42.08]With a little bit of basil on it.
[92:46.75]I like it.
[92:47.11]I think it's good.
[92:52.15]Tomato so yes, so does it every pizza has tomato.
[92:57.74]This is not squished up Let's do some scratches What lobster pizza
[93:21.80]Not all pizza has tomato sauce as a base.
[93:24.92]Yeah, but if you order 100 pizzas, 90 of them are going to have red tomato sauce on them.
[93:32.07]Sometimes, you know, you get a white pizza or a pesto sauce.
[93:36.43]Most people will put pizza sauce on their pizza.
[93:39.01]Is this something we actually have to argue?
[93:42.31]That a majority of pizzas sold on Earth have tomato sauce on them?
[93:49.50]You guys realize that, like, most people, like, order pizza from Domino's?
[93:55.52]More than... And I'm on a rant.
[94:02.60]No, there's no rants.
[94:04.80]It's not like 30% of people put tomato sauce on their pizza.
[94:09.18]It's, like, close to 100.
[94:10.00]Okay.
[94:10.12]Meow, meow.
[94:24.54]Guys, don't talk about pizza.
[94:25.46]That means he ends the stream.
[94:27.74]Oh, shit.
[94:28.18]You're right.
[94:28.92]Stop doing that.
[94:31.18]Yeah.
[94:34.37]That's gotta do it.
[94:36.21]21 pounds.
[94:36.61]Alright.
[94:37.19]Bad mood, though.
[94:40.05]A good massage will do it.
[94:41.95]There, there.
[94:42.61]There, there.
[94:45.25]There, there.
[95:01.19]And this is all it took.
[95:10.17]20!
[95:10.21]I got a 20.
[95:10.51]21.
[95:10.53]That's gotta do it.
[95:14.04]Alright, now we're gonna feed you the most high quality food.
[95:18.52]Premium.
[95:18.74]Premium.
[95:22.80]Only premium for my cat.
[95:32.34]She's not breathing anymore.
[95:43.84]Stop stacking them!
[95:44.80]Why are you stacking four or five of them?
[95:46.32]What the fuck are you doing?
[95:47.36]Hmm.
[95:56.59]Anime, watch the anime!
[95:58.87]No.
[96:03.36]No, Netflix has ruined me.
[96:05.72]I'm not waiting a week for an episode ever again for any TV show that's ever been released from here going out.
[96:10.46]I can't, I'm not doing that anymore.
[96:13.76]The whole thing's just there.
[96:16.48]I want to be able to watch an entire series run in three days.
[96:24.17]I'm watching one episode and then waiting like three hours.
[96:30.42]Oh, we have to go here where the sword upgrades are.
[96:38.90]JoJo is on Netflix.
[96:40.98]I don't want to watch that right now.
[96:48.16]Oh, it's you.
[96:48.84]I'm not finished with that new toy you asked for.
[96:52.14]What?
[96:54.48]50,000 for a Camellia MK3.

[98:19.33]Whoa, he's changing it on me!
[98:20.43]He's changing it on me real quick!
[98:27.11]This makes me really, really excited for the third game.
[98:30.95]I hope it's just as weird and interesting and with some cool things to do.
[98:41.40]It's the funniest movie of the year.

[100:19.18]Because what wasn't the thing with the one on PC was it was not that great.
[100:22.86]It was still okay.
[100:23.76]I fucking blew it again.
[100:26.90]I can take one hit, right?
[100:39.58]It's good?
[100:40.00]There we go, yeah, you can get hit once.
[100:44.92]Okay, but it's not the same.
[100:47.71]TSA is more about the lore.
[100:52.95]TSA was a vent post by Suda.
[100:57.17]Wait, what do you mean?
[100:59.42]A vent post?

[105:52.34]What the hell would I do that for?
[106:05.57]This reminds me of Super Mario.
[106:06.89]I was gonna say Super Mario.
[106:28.75]You know what's a bad thing when I hear the word super and I want to say Mario?
[106:32.73]I don't think of Mario, I think of Super Frog.
[106:41.44]Come on, get it!

[108:03.87]Pizza bat's putting all the family pizzerias out of business, the most beloved of them all.
[108:07.63]Pizza suplex has been a fixture of this town for generations, but now it's about to go bankrupt.
[108:12.03]They need top-notch delivery men to turn things around.
[108:14.31]Deliver the pizzas to all the customers within the time limit.
[108:25.56]Pizza with a vengeance.
[108:27.66]Accelerate, that's another fun one to do.
[108:29.46]Brake, change gear, steer.
[108:33.64]Celebrate, break, change gear.
[108:36.08]I can do nitro.
[108:38.86]What do you do?
[108:45.22]This is pizzas?
[108:51.94]Alright, high gear.
[108:54.86]I don't know why I thought that was a hamburger on the road that I had to pick up.
[108:58.89]I thought that was a hamburger on the road.
[109:01.27]It was very small.
[109:03.84]Like, that's not food or anything.
[109:05.20]That's a rock, right?
[109:06.06]Okay.
[109:11.85]See?
[109:12.33]I told you.
[109:13.21]There's stuff in the road.
[109:15.71]They look friendly until they get real close.
[109:18.61]God damn it.
[109:22.61]That's not a car, right?
[109:24.39]Those are cars.
[109:26.23]What the fuck?
[109:27.98]What is this?
[109:28.50]Nintendo.
[109:31.70]Nintendo.
[109:43.61]Duh!
[109:47.77]Oh, letter grade.
[109:48.31]Yeah, of course.
[109:52.52]They don't give you very much leeway there.
[109:58.10]I can do better than that.
[110:07.74]Dude, what was that- that game?
[110:08.80]I gotta- I wanna play that game.
[110:09.80]That Super Nintendo game with... Um... It's like Mon- when Montana Max, it's a Tiny Toons game.
[110:15.42]We have to spam A and like cut down trees and it's like the Olympics.

[110:24.37]I haven't played that on stream, have I?
[110:26.41]Oh, this is one of my- one of my favorite games.
[110:27.45]Ah, that's my favorite game ever.
[110:29.67]It's the Tiny Toons Olympic Games game.
[110:32.83]The Tiny Toons and the games!
[110:37.12]Somebody will know what I'm talking about.

[111:21.62]Thanks, Chunky Bologna, for the $50.
[111:26.26]Hi Jerem, I'm pretty sure that was me who left the music on, but I was pissed at one of our suite mates so I did it on purpose.
[111:32.71]However, I didn't know the CD would skip.
[111:34.99]It was just supposed to be for like 30 minutes, not 4 hours.
[111:40.76]Hey, my bad.
[111:54.18]Oh, that's so funny.
[111:55.84]Oh, it's CD guy!
[112:05.15]That's so fucking funny.
[112:07.05]The stage just got bigger, but thanks for the $50, dude.
[112:08.93]You don't have to do that.
[112:12.94]You guys pay me huge fucking money.
[112:14.86]For me to get run over by cars?
[112:27.25]How the fuck did I miss that?
[112:34.91]Dude, this stage is going to spin horizontal.
[112:37.31]It's going to be stage five of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[112:42.96]Turtles in time.
[112:48.18]What comes first?
[112:49.98]It's a fucking Mack truck.
[113:03.96]It's hard to determine when the toads evolve into cars in front of your screen.
[113:13.56]Too fast.
[113:25.19]Why are they all going the same direction?
[113:26.83]I don't know, but I can't wait to spam.
[113:30.17]I got- I'm playing that, like, very soon.
[113:34.15]Tiny Toons.
[113:36.05]Outdoor games.
[113:38.63]That game was hard as shit.

[113:42.17]Yeah, Wacky Sports Challenge.
[113:43.28]You got it.
[113:43.60]That's the one.
[113:51.10]Cancel the green screen for Tiny Toons.
[113:52.62]Wow, here we go.
[114:03.39]How did I do that?
[114:04.55]What do you think I am?
[114:06.81]I missed it.
[114:10.53]Why are there so many cars going the wrong way?
[114:35.05]I'm the one going the wrong way.
[114:38.36]What?
[114:39.10]No, there's a middle divider.
[114:40.46]You're the yellow line.
[114:45.54]They're going the wrong way.
[114:54.59]What?
[114:58.65]That was actually shocking to me.
[115:08.40]I'm trying to rip the fucking wheel, man.
[115:15.30]I got 30 seconds to get the hell out of here.
[115:18.01]Alright.

[115:19.03]Go.
[115:19.13]Finish it.
[115:20.49]No more bullshit.
[115:32.83]There was no control.

[116:22.72]No, I don't like the cartoon games.
[116:29.83]No.
[116:30.91]I don't like when the game is based on the cartoon.
[116:32.71]I like for the game to be just the game.
[116:46.55]No, what I'm saying is like the TMNT game the new ones are like tie-ins with like Nickelodeon It's not like oh Konami just made a Ninja Turtles game.
[117:01.01]Oh

[117:29.76]What do you mean, so?
[117:32.00]Okay, I'll give you a hand here.
[117:33.94]Hulk Ultimate Destruction versus Hulk the Video Game for Wii.
[117:39.02]Somebody just made a Hulk game because they wanted to.
[117:40.96]They didn't base it on a cartoon character.
[117:42.31]They didn't base it on a currently running cartoon TV show.
[117:45.85]I'm an agent.
[117:46.79]Anything less would be uncivilized.
[117:49.63]Now, take a seat.
[117:50.47]Let's get started.
[117:55.45]Right.
[117:56.39]So, who's next?
[117:58.45]Charlie and his groupies.
[118:00.62]Groupies?
[118:01.66]What's that supposed to mean?
[118:03.36]Thanks.
[118:04.32]If I told you now, I'd ruin the surprise.
[118:07.66]Go see for yourself.
[118:09.09]Fine.
[118:09.75]Whoever they are, I'll make sure they get a nice close-up of my beam katana.
[118:14.63]All you feel is ecstasy when you kill.
[118:17.15]It's like you're getting off.
[118:19.45]Seriously.
[118:21.09]You need help.
[118:22.47]Everybody deals with grief differently, right?
[118:25.09]Some people fuck at funerals.
[118:27.31]I cut off heads.
[118:31.38]Do what you must, Travis.
[118:33.66]What the hell?
[118:40.02]Who does that?
[118:40.76]I don't know.
[118:45.94]Alright.
[118:47.42]So.
[118:48.46]Do I have... Let's go get some new clothes.
[118:58.79]You do, psycho streamer.
[119:00.11]Did you find something yet?
[119:06.32]Hope so.
[119:13.77]Oh, I don't like this.
[119:15.34]This is the only one that's different, though.
[119:29.10]It's $35, whatever.
[119:30.36]No, I don't like this one.
[119:33.60]It feels like I'm too fat for this jacket.
[119:35.40]It feels like the zipper won't go up anymore.
[119:43.99]Blue shirt.
[119:44.45]Can I just take the jacket off?
[119:48.91]And be in a graphic tee?
[119:55.01]Ice cream.
[119:55.33]Yeah, I want the ice cream.
[119:58.21]I'll take it.
[120:04.73]Please give me new pants.
[120:06.52]Alright, at least they're...
[120:13.11]Alright, this screaming in the background is kind of getting to me here.
[120:22.41]This is Haunted House CD Track 12.
[120:32.18]Reobate?
[120:34.70]15 community subs.
[120:35.72]Thank you, Reobate.
[120:37.16]Appreciate it.
[120:40.42]That's 15 subs.
[120:42.17]It just dropped right fucking high.
[120:50.35]I'll take it.
[120:51.73]I don't even like this belt.
[120:52.75]Why did I just get it?
[120:53.63]I'll take it.
[121:00.00]I just spent all my money on stuff that I don't even want.
[121:04.98]Sing along?
[121:06.58]Sure.
[121:08.96]Oh.

[121:20.14]Simpsons?
[121:20.64]Where's the next Simpsons game?
[121:22.20]Time for a ranking battle.

[121:53.64]What do we got?
[121:56.76]This guy plays Tiny Toon Adventures.
[122:03.70]Why do they even need to click on this?
[122:07.54]I kind of want that shirt now.
[122:14.99]I kind of want this.
[122:16.19]Alright, I got a new weapon, right?
[122:22.67]There it is.
[122:23.16]Let's see it.
[122:26.94]Oh, it's like from the last game.
[122:28.50]It's like a katana.
[122:45.63]Who the fuck is this guy?
[122:46.75]Wait, this is just a good worker.
[122:54.03]Who was that?
[122:57.33]I think, wait, it's like a... Oh, Reborn!
[123:10.04]Yeah, that guy was making a delivery.
[123:12.54]It was like a pizza delivery.
[123:14.92]I mean, why would you get out of the car?
[123:19.67]Sean, this looks like a place where I'd want to be right now.
[123:28.29]Is that a limo?
[123:35.55]I don't know.
[123:37.19]See, special delivery.
[123:40.54]Anything else?
[123:46.08]Could be a secret.
[123:50.44]I can do the super slash in a second here.
[123:51.80]I haven't done it in a while.
[124:08.25]Hey, I've been PvPing for fucking decades, kid.

[124:58.01]Alright, take his ass.
[125:02.19]It doesn't do any damage.
[125:06.71]Secret!

[126:09.97]I heard him sing.
[126:28.94]I queued up.
[126:29.76]I was going back and forth about to do it.

[130:18.04]The phone booth or something.
[130:20.82]And I get out and I'm like, look at me!
[130:23.26]Something like farting and screaming sounds.
[130:30.93]I could probably be putting cheese in my mouth and heating it up with my oven in my mouth.
[130:34.01]I wouldn't tell that to my mother.
[130:35.77]She'd be like, what's happening to you?
[130:42.65]Able to make himself sound like a fucking psycho in a single level.
[130:52.80]Is able to complete Doug's hopes in three sittings on stream.
[131:05.48]It's a chair!
[131:06.98]It's a statue!
[131:08.48]No!
[131:09.40]It's a live streamer!
[131:18.88]Alright, there's another chest up here.
[131:30.19]Gotcha!
[131:31.41]At McDonald's!
[131:36.92]Oh my god, wait, you're the streamer?
[131:38.84]Yup, it's me.
[131:39.56]I'm talking about my secret identity, which is just me with glasses on.
[131:47.45]Apparently people are this dumb.
[132:05.36]Well, they are.
[132:09.76]Cool, crisp LT.
[132:13.22]Fixed cameras.
[132:14.62]We just got to see it.
[132:16.18]You saw it happen.
[132:17.96]That's why I don't like fixed cameras in Resident Evil video games.
[132:26.39]Play ads now.
[132:28.01]That's not what you've been listening to for the last, like, two or three straight minutes.
[132:32.17]The last, like, ten minutes has been an ad for McDonald's.
[132:34.03]What are you talking about?
[133:10.65]After this, I'm going to touch you down.
[133:16.39]A butt-kicking day to you all.
[133:18.63]It looks like Samus with the helmet on.
[133:22.19]Mr. Touchdown, it's an honor to face you.
[133:25.31]Man, I love your name.
[133:27.07]You're going to fight me with all your hoes?
[133:29.59]That's my game, but we need a better arena, don't you think?
[133:33.77]Let's go, ladies.
[133:35.72]Santa Death Parade!
[133:46.32]Oh, God.
[133:49.26]Oh, God.
[134:02.43]I thought something like this might happen.
[134:04.95]Time to bust out the toy Naomi made.
[134:07.21]Ooh.
[134:09.03]Rocket ship?
[134:09.58]His long-awaited debut.
[134:12.70]Glastonbury.
[134:14.40]Let's pop.
[134:22.29]I don't remember this at all.
[134:35.22]Gotcha Force 2.
[134:36.44]Yeah, we get to play Gotcha Force.
[134:38.64]What?
[134:40.59]A is slash.
[134:42.11]B is jump.
[134:43.51]Z is guard.
[134:44.87]Press A or B while jumping to jump attack.
[134:48.74]I see when the Exe is full and needs a special move.
[134:58.08]Guard is okay.
[134:58.60]Can I jump over it?
[135:03.15]He's kicking the shit out of me.
[135:06.01]Where am I?
[135:08.89]Alright, block.
[135:15.94]Guard.
[135:23.45]You can jump over it.
[135:28.49]No!
[135:29.65]Jump!
[135:35.36]See!
[135:35.58]I saw the background.
[135:39.38]I thought I was going to have to do a pipe dream again.
[135:49.60]No!
[135:50.20]Jump over it.
[135:53.10]No!
[136:06.49]Fuck.
[136:09.16]Fuck.
[136:13.53]Why wouldn't you fight everybody in this suit?
[136:16.33]That's a good question.
[136:17.39]You gotta be close, right?
[136:24.45]Wait, he just said it twice.
[136:28.81]Did you hear that?
[136:34.32]Oh, fuck!
[136:34.84]I'm trying to jump, but he's still slow.
[136:47.72]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[136:48.96]He's dead.
[136:54.64]He's slow to move.
[137:03.77]I feel like if he shrugged his shoulders hard enough, he would squish his head.
[137:13.35]And it would just explode.
[137:28.55]A, B, C, Z. I'll hit them all at the same time.
[137:37.59]God, that was just like the skip thing fucked it up.
[137:39.35]That was like in the middle of an insanely important part of the story.
[137:43.05]The thing on the bottom right pops up and it's like Peter Griffin and Lois.
[137:46.17]It's like Family Guy.
[137:49.15]9pm on TBS.
[137:51.05]Like, I don't fucking ever want to see that again.
[137:57.42]Well done, Travis.
[137:59.35]You are now 26.
[138:06.52]I should make some of those.
[138:07.70]And just have them pop up randomly.
[138:13.20]Just made up shows and shit that I do.
[138:15.66]Whoa, whoa, wait!
[138:21.97]I mean, they weren't that harmless.
[138:24.57]You can tear some shit up with a pot of pop.
[138:27.73]Yeah, I'm gonna do it.
[138:30.35]We'll get some maid from the green screen incoming.
[138:35.04]The hell you will!
[138:37.28]It is too big and it is a public nuisance.
[138:40.46]You gotta be kidding!
[138:42.45]Man, I had this baby custom made.
[138:44.77]I'll do something like point at the camera.
[138:46.07]Walk into frame.
[138:47.17]Look around.
[138:47.51]Look at the bottom.
[138:48.07]Point at the title of the fucking game or something.
[138:51.41]Yeah, look at that.
[138:52.55]Thumbs up.
[138:53.63]Then like walk back off.
[138:54.75]There are just as many below as above and they all want you dead.
[139:13.22]Charlie McDonald?
[139:22.46]Travis, touchdown.
[139:26.41]How do you pick your nose with gloves on?
[139:27.87]Um... That's kind of disgusting.
[139:36.11]Well, you take your glove off, you pick your nose, and then you put your glove back on.
[139:50.37]Fingerless glove.
[139:59.38]Skippable optional boss coming.
[140:00.96]Do it.
[140:01.28]Okay.
[140:01.70]Whoa there, Ice Queen.
[140:03.30]What's with the harsh treatment?
[140:14.50]Anime time.

[140:27.75]I like her better when she's horny.
[140:34.80]ES2 feet.
[140:37.36]You guys are fucking crazy.
[140:56.30]hands and feet in all old games were just like lego blocks that's all they were like all feet in all games before like 2007 was all like dinosaur feet
[141:18.14]And then, like, mittens for hands.
[141:31.63]No.

[141:34.28]Watch the anime.
[141:35.08]I'm not watching anime.
[141:38.50]No.
[141:43.14]This thing would be fun to have in your bedroom.
[141:44.48]Just get up in the morning and just fucking roundhouse kick this thing as hard as you can.
[141:47.88]That's how you start your day.
[141:49.50]I would start every day like that.
[141:50.56]I would get up in the morning and kind of get in the shower, comb my hair, and then just do the hardest spinning roundhouse kick I could and fucking destroy this thing.
[142:01.70]And then I'm ready for the day.
[142:10.04]Let's go.
[142:11.97]Jump.
[142:15.37]You can do it.
[142:19.79]You can do it.
[142:20.75]You can pull your hernia every morning.
[142:27.51]I already have a hernia, man.
[142:32.90]I'm fucking falling apart.
[142:38.88]Alright, let go.
[142:43.90]Let go!
[142:45.94]Lost 0.3 pounds.
[142:47.16]Okay.

[144:16.12]Go, go, go, go, go!
[144:33.39]That was pretty good, lined up like that.
[144:37.40]Beat my record.

[146:56.70]You missed the boss?
[146:58.16]You're lying to me.
[146:58.96]There's no boss at the end of a tape.
[147:02.52]Supernatural gateways in Center Destroy.
[147:05.80]Have you heard about them?
[147:10.33]and lead to different planes of existence.
[147:14.33]Like a sacred forest inhabited by not only evil, but something else in between.
[147:22.23]I read about it online, and I laughed it off.
[147:26.49]Lost souls who escaped death through deals with the devil, ending up in hideous forms.
[147:34.74]You don't believe me.
[147:37.94]You can believe what you want.
[147:44.10]We're telling the truth.
[147:45.14]You're being manipulated.
[147:50.06]Put another video over the cringe.
[147:53.84]Okay, fine.
[148:27.84]Hang tight for a sec.
[148:45.60]Sit right here for a minute.
[148:46.53]I'm going to turn it on in just a moment.
[148:54.83]Let me just move this.

[152:28.66]Yeah, this is not time sensitive.

[153:13.92]Rare, medium, well done.
[153:16.54]Man the meat.
[153:21.81]Medium.
[153:22.77]Medium.
[153:25.93]Oops, that was right out of the... That was right out of the back... Rare.
[153:35.77]There we go.
[153:36.29]Well done.
[153:44.94]and and that's two done perfect
[154:25.33]Help me out here.
[154:26.23]When you go to a restaurant and there's steak on the menu, is it rude to order a steak well done at a restaurant?
[154:34.01]Are you saying that, hey, I always thought that was like, oh, the chef's an asshole or something, right?
[154:40.29]Like, hey, I'm ordering a steak.
[154:41.25]Well done at your restaurant.
[154:42.91]I think you're an asshole.
[154:45.19]Right?
[154:46.05]That's kind of how it's seen?
[154:48.13]That's the etiquette?
[154:54.92]That's a fuck you.
[154:58.84]Fuck you.
[155:02.68]They hate it.
[155:05.38]Why do I always have this image of some chef, some waiter coming over with a ticket being like, hey, the guy at table seven wants a well done steak.
[155:12.85]Steak, well done.
[155:13.57]And they just start trashing the place.
[155:16.41]Fucking steak welder.
[155:19.59]Pots all over the place.
[155:20.49]Is that like what happens?
[155:21.45]Do I watch too much fucking cooking American TV where everything is a constant problem in the kitchen?
[155:30.26]See, as somebody that watches American TV based on cooking shows, it's fucking mayhem back there.
[155:37.20]Every second of every hour.
[155:38.66]Is it true?
[155:39.20]This is constant conflict.
[155:47.59]What was wrong with that?
[155:59.11]Like, is there always- is this just drama?
[156:04.51]Like, do the chefs all hate each other?
[156:05.77]That guy wanted medium?
[156:09.11]What?
[156:12.62]Just a quick little sear!
[156:25.22]Disgusting.
[156:28.41]Absolutely revolting, if I'm honest with you.
[156:34.69]Taking out of the package, putting it on one side for five seconds, on the other side for five seconds.
[156:40.37]No.
[156:41.69]That's not for me.
[156:43.29]Blue.
[156:47.18]Oh, it's cooking faster.
[156:51.22]What do you mean tastes like shit?
[156:52.48]That was well done.
[156:53.50]What was wrong with that?
[157:02.17]That's fucking well done!
[157:03.99]That shit's green, mate!
[157:06.21]I cooked it till it was green!
[157:13.49]That's well done!
[157:14.31]Yeah, but raw steak.
[157:24.40]That's disgusting.
[157:31.43]Perfect.
[157:33.57]Ding ding!
[157:34.47]Why does everybody want well done steak here?
[157:38.75]There we go.
[157:39.49]Gee, I'm an actual human.
[157:41.19]Medium!
[157:41.51]Give it to me raw!
[157:43.89]Whoa!
[157:59.51]You're gonna be burnt!
[158:00.52]What the fuck?
[158:01.22]Die!
[158:01.82]We're all insulting you.
[158:09.75]Well done!
[158:15.74]I don't even fucking like steak.
[158:16.88]Steak sucks.
[158:17.66]Like, I don't even eat it.
[158:19.38]Why am I pretending like I'm some kind of... Well, you know, uh... Did you say you got an order from a chef?
[158:24.48]Does the chef like you?
[158:25.87]I don't even... What the fuck?
[158:26.77]What do I care?
[158:29.59]I don't even like steak.
[158:42.45]I like some steak.
[158:47.30]Some of it.
[158:47.86]I mean, I like steak and cheese subs, but that's just like a carved up fucking hamburger.
[159:02.25]Steakums.
[159:02.99]Yeah.
[159:04.41]And I would like someone to come to tell me the problem with a steakum.
[159:08.01]I'd love to know what it is.
[159:10.21]Take a look at the back of the box.
[159:11.65]Oh, Steakums?
[159:13.83]Look at the back of that box.
[159:14.69]You want to know what's in it?
[159:16.03]You want to know what's in Steakums?
[159:19.72]100% just beef.
[159:22.52]There's nothing else in it.
[159:23.44]There's literally nothing else in it.
[159:24.48]It's just meat.
[159:25.48]There's no fucking fillers and emulsifiers and oils.
[159:29.82]It's just frozen meat.
[159:30.98]That's all it is.
[159:31.40]I'm not doing this exact joke.
[159:34.06]This is not a joke.
[159:34.62]This is me telling you real life.
[159:37.06]This is not a comedy routine.
[159:39.46]This is me telling you to look at the back of the box next time you go to the grocery store and you get steak.
[159:42.66]It's just 100% beef.
[159:44.39]It just is.
[159:44.83]I don't know.
[159:45.39]But does that mean it's like eyeballs?
[159:47.07]I don't know.
[159:47.35]I have no idea.
[159:49.55]But it's real.
[159:50.55]There's nothing else in it.
[160:00.02]Look it up.
[160:00.46]Look this up.
[160:03.10]What is really in steak ovens?
[160:06.62]Okay.
[160:12.09]New lawsuit reveals the world's grossest meat products are probably steakums.
[160:17.30]Okay.
[160:17.46]It's 2012, by the way.
[160:18.40]Uhh...
[160:46.29]Okay.
[160:46.87]In courtroom proceedings, the composition of the meat came to light.
[160:49.39]The Daily News reports that it's chopped, formed, and emulsified meat product that is comprised of beef trimmings left over after an animal is slaughtered, and all the primary cuts, such as tenderloin, fillet, and ribeye, are removed.
[161:01.78]The emulsified meat is pressed into a loaf and then sliced and frozen.
[161:05.34]Okay.
[161:07.20]Yeah, steakums are not ribeye steak.
[161:11.68]Um... That's...
[161:16.35]Who cares?
[161:16.69]Yeah.
[161:16.81]That's fine.
[161:27.63]Not emulsified.
[161:28.65]Did I say that?
[161:32.41]Well, no.
[161:33.89]What did I say?
[161:34.83]I said there were no emulsifiers in it.
[161:37.99]I said no emulsifiers.
[161:39.19]That doesn't mean it was not emulsified previously, but not in the package.
[161:42.15]There's no emulsifiers.
[161:45.58]There are no... Like, for instance, there's no, like, egg yolk.
[161:51.48]Or there's no, like, oil.
[161:54.78]Could they have crushed it up and emulsified it in a big machine?
[161:57.50]Yeah, but not here.
[161:58.40]Not when it's in the package.
[162:00.70]Why am I defending it?
[162:01.56]I don't know.
[162:01.88]I like them.
[162:05.08]Is something wrong with me liking steakums?
[162:08.13]Yeah, it's like fucking... It's like trimmings.
[162:14.87]Guess what's in a McDonald's hamburger?
[162:17.64]Not filet mignon.
[162:18.56]You know what's in a Wendy's hamburger?
[162:22.62]Yeah, all pure filet mignon meat.
[162:24.91]I got some money for that, though.
[162:36.85]What am I talking about?
[162:38.33]You eat McDonald's and you eat Wendy's and you're telling me that I'm crazy for eating Steakums?
[162:42.05]It's the same shit, just one's different.
[162:44.57]One's like shaved and put in a different box.
[162:56.44]My best tile layer actually fell.
[163:03.30]You're eating dog food.
[163:04.70]Please.
[163:08.55]They make the patties thicker and they send the fucking rest of McDonald's wherever they go This is just Tetris Okay rotate oh boy wait Wait what do I have to fill this whole thing in?
[163:38.91]Oh, this ain't, this is never gonna happen.
[163:52.66]They could get it all up.
[163:54.70]Sorry, I got worked up because the people were fucking flaming steakums.
[163:58.46]Yeah, that sounds pretty good, actually.
[164:11.98]Oh, man.
[164:12.88]Let's pick it all up.
[164:19.14]I need to look at this again.
[164:26.06]Okay.
[164:26.92]Now.
[164:30.62]Dog food brain?
[164:32.38]No, I'm not out of the dog food brain.
[164:42.86]Fuck.
[164:58.03]Turns out this dude sucks.
[165:00.41]Well, whatever.
[165:01.45]I don't have trouble with this shit.
[165:05.15]What, I can't have a little bit of trouble with some shit?
[165:09.72]Of course I can.
[165:11.08]I can have trouble with whatever I want.
[165:12.78]I don't know, just a square?
[165:24.93]You have to be perfect, I know, and...
[165:34.04]I don't know.
[165:34.54]I have no idea.
[165:34.92]I don't know.
[165:35.34]I'll get it eventually when I get- I'm not doing level 3.
[165:37.60]I can't do it.
[165:39.18]I can't do it.
[165:39.64]I can't even pay attention to this right now.
[165:41.22]It's like too much for me right now.
[165:46.39]Maybe like this?
[165:47.11]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[178:43.20]Perfect, perfect, perfect.
[178:45.84]No, you linked me this before and it's wrong.
[178:47.68]It's not even accurate.
[178:51.18]Just play the beat game.
[178:52.15]No, I have to beat this.
[178:58.40]and that that image is wrong it's the one two three four five one two three four five it's not even right so what was wrong with this one somebody gave me a fake one
[179:31.54]You guys are giving me fake ones.
[179:44.09]This dude is so disappointed in you.
[179:58.08]He's too high.
[179:58.93]No, I'm not.
[179:59.83]I'm not.
[180:01.91]I'm taking a small dose to see how it works for pain relief, and it actually works pretty very, very good so far.
[180:08.53]I'm gonna give it a week.
[180:49.03]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[180:51.64]AHHHHH!
[180:54.34]WAIT!
[181:08.72]Hey, look at me!
[181:13.30]That was- I can't fucking believe it took that long.
[181:40.25]alright I just had to prove that I wasn't like the dumbest person you've ever watched on live stream I just needed to make sure I would I wanted let's do the hamburger one you still are ban that person how dare you say that to me
[182:12.25]Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot.
[182:18.84]There you go, there's your... This is your brain on drugs?
[182:30.93]No, I'm on a very small dose, okay?
[182:35.60]I'm on like, it's three grams of CBD, okay?
[182:40.00]It's like, it's not even like a quarter of a regular one.
[182:50.23]That's a shitload.
[182:51.63]What?
[182:55.04]No, three milligrams.
[182:56.96]No, not three.
[183:01.60]CPD doesn't make you hide this THC in this thing that I have.
[183:14.59]It's 3.3 milligrams of THC.
[183:16.13]Nice.
[183:31.15]Which is not a whole lot.
[183:33.17]But I don't want a whole lot.
[183:34.95]I just want to try to do a little trial for pain relief.
[183:48.86]Yeah, the goal is for me not to get... I'm not trying to get fucked up.
[183:55.98]He really wants us to believe him.
[184:05.16]Share your weed brownie recipe.
[184:07.72]I don't have one.
[184:08.52]Jerm, you're doing fine.
[184:14.31]Hey!
[184:15.85]Play Jump King?
[184:23.33]What?
[184:27.09]I can't play Jump King ever again!
[184:28.69]I deleted my- I'm not starting at zero.
[184:33.96]Heard nothing but good things about CBD and inflammation.
[184:37.36]Yes.
[184:38.94]And especially... The idea is... If I have... Neuralgia.
[184:45.67]If I have nerve pain, just nerve damage somehow...
[184:49.66]and there's only a few things I can really do to try to counteract it so um there it's you know it's out there that for potentially uh nerve pain THC and CBD can maybe help so I'm trying
[185:14.71]I wasn't gonna talk about it, but... Yeah, why would I care to even bring it up if I'm doing, like, a small dose of CBD and THC?
[185:22.96]Like, well, I don't care.
[185:23.84]But, like, if you can't do a children's puzzle in, like, 30 minutes, then, like, I should probably tell you.
[185:39.69]Started a week ago?
[185:40.45]Yeah, I'm gonna give it like two weeks.
[185:43.43]Just doing like a very small dose.
[185:45.83]And... I don't know.
[185:49.19]I'm not gonna tell you that it's... I don't want a placebo effect to happen here.
[185:52.58]But we'll see in like a week.
[185:57.71]How do I feel?
[185:58.29]I feel pretty good.
[185:59.71]I feel good.
[186:01.79]And I guess thankfully... That was fine.
[186:05.19]The really good part is... It's medium.
[186:11.44]That's a medium stick.
[186:17.04]It's legal in Las Vegas.
[186:19.82]So... How is that not well done?
[186:24.89]Well done.
[186:29.15]You want it more than that?
[186:31.43]That?
[186:31.99]You don't want to eat that, right?
[186:33.17]That's why he moved there.
[186:42.04]It was becoming legal in Massachusetts, too, before I left, so that's not why.
[186:53.40]That was well done.
[186:54.24]I don't believe it.
[186:56.04]He just couldn't wait.
[187:02.07]I feel like I'm playing, somebody's in Monster Hunter.
[187:09.65]I feel like I'm playing Monster Hunter right now.
[187:13.78]Oh, fuck you.
[187:26.74]Play the actual game?
[187:27.68]Yeah, I will eventually.
[187:29.90]What is this?
[187:38.74]From a click link now.
[187:44.65]Click link now.
[187:45.49]Click link.
[187:46.07]Stackem emerges as unlikely coronavirus misinformation watchdog.
[187:54.78]What?
[188:09.40]During a crisis, people turn to many different places for advice, wisdom, and comfort.
[188:12.87]During the global coronavirus pandemic, many are tapping an unlikely source, a processed meat brand.
[188:18.71]Steakums, the decades-old maker of thin-sliced frozen beef used in cheesesteak sandwiches, has garnered considerable attention on social media during the coronavirus crisis, with a Twitter thread warning people to question their news sources amid a torrent of misinformation about the virus.
[188:37.57]Did I just eat the onion?
[188:41.53]Is this real?
[188:42.47]This is real, right?
[188:43.09]Okay, now it's real.
[188:53.24]Oh, steak him.
[188:53.86]Yeah, steak him.
[189:01.51]Alright, now let's do the actual mission.
[189:08.80]Who uses a craft Facebook?
[189:11.52]Who uses like Stackem's Facebook as their news source?
[189:22.67]That is a little odd.
[189:26.92]Go to the university?
[189:27.72]I'm gun eyes.
[189:28.12]I need to save the game.
[189:34.26]Secret boss.
[189:34.84]You can miss it.
[189:35.38]Go to the university.
[189:36.18]I'm going.
[189:41.01]Oh, steakums.
[189:41.91]Okay, well, whatever.
[189:46.51]Alright, university.
[190:02.74]To the university.
[190:09.42]Is this the university?
[190:10.22]Where's the university?
[190:11.30]Is that the university?
[190:21.37]Wait, that's the university.
[190:22.54]It's right here.
[190:23.20]Wait, what are you talking about?
[190:27.64]It's just the next mission.
[190:29.12]Oh, is this a secret?
[190:42.13]I had to unlock.
[190:48.25]Are you prepared?
[190:53.96]You found the hidden boss?
[190:58.32]Are you fucking kidding me?
[191:00.78]Do you think I should try to swear less?
[191:02.94]Like, really?
[191:03.36]Should I be active about it?
[191:04.85]Should I just think about it?
[191:06.03]What am I saying here?
[191:07.53]Should I stop swearing?
[191:10.93]Place words.
[191:14.70]Instead of saying, like, fuck, should I say, like... Look out, or... Shit.
[191:22.42]Shit's fine.
[191:23.60]My mother told me she wants me to stop saying the F word.
[191:29.18]By the way, big fan.
[191:35.21]Look at you.
[191:38.51]Swearing is for CBD users.
[191:43.31]What the hell was that?
[191:47.17]Oh, it must have been the secret boss.
[191:57.87]What the fuck?
[191:58.85]What the fuck?
[192:00.66]Sorry, mom.
[192:01.82]We both did it.
[192:12.83]Damn.
[192:13.43]Alright, get in.

[192:26.58]Come on, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick.
[192:51.80]Why am I laughing at that?
[192:54.77]I shouldn't be laughing at this.
[192:56.07]Way harder than the regular enemies.
[193:04.42]Oh my god!
[193:06.56]This guy was a pain in the ass.
[193:29.31]I'm ready for this shit.
[193:30.19]These guys have so much health Yeah
[193:47.00]If you read this, you are stoned.
[193:54.24]That means I must be... What the fuck was that?
[194:11.58]Next battery.
[194:14.18]Extra cranked.
[194:16.65]Wasn't there a movie with Jason Statham where if his blood pressure dropped or his heart rate dropped by a certain amount, his heart exploded?
[194:28.72]That movie must have been crazy.
[194:31.06]I wish it was public domain.
[194:32.32]I would love to watch it.
[194:33.20]Can I do that on Amazon?
[194:36.84]The Amazon Twitch watch party thing?
[194:40.12]Can we watch Crank?
[194:51.97]Terms of service.
[194:56.48]Comes a secret boss, boys.
[195:02.12]Frank was made public domain by Donald Trump.
[195:05.90]Gonna sign an executive order.
[195:08.59]In a movie crank.
[195:09.29]To be put in the Library of Congress.
[195:11.35]Can I call you Travis the Great?
[195:14.05]Travis Ravenous?
[195:15.62]Cool hand, teasy greasy?
[195:19.20]I'm sorry.
[195:19.96]I've always been a fan.
[195:23.27]What?
[195:24.27]A fan?
[195:25.55]Of me?
[195:27.66]Yes!
[195:29.12]I watched your fight with Charlie, too.
[195:31.50]Oh, you were hardcore.
[195:33.80]So cool.
[195:35.18]Oh, no.
[195:36.56]I feel really nervous.
[195:38.59]I think I'm gonna puke.
[195:39.63]OMG, I bet you hate girls who puke.
[195:42.53]Uh, never really thought about it.
[195:48.07]Don't stare at me.
[195:49.81]You're staring at me.
[195:50.95]If you get me preggers, promise you won't ditch me, okay?
[195:53.73]What the fuck?
[195:54.55]Anyway, I wrote down all my feelings in a letter.
[195:57.25]Here, take it.
[195:59.41]Your, uh, feelings?
[196:01.17]So this is a love letter?
[196:03.49]Take it, take it, or I'll totally die.
[196:07.84]Okay, thanks.
[196:09.32]I could use a dose of innocence.
[196:11.34]That last fight got a little sick, even for me.
[196:17.74]Um, aren't you going to read it?
[196:20.24]Huh?
[196:21.86]Read it?
[196:22.44]Now?
[196:23.38]Here?
[196:24.42]Yes!
[196:25.48]You have to read it out loud.
[196:26.82]No, I wasn't even going to open it.
[196:28.33]I was going to shred it.
[196:30.77]So you read and I'll play it on my flute, okay?
[196:34.71]You're joking, right?
[196:36.77]Read this here?
[196:37.49]Here we go.
[196:39.25]Get into it.
[196:45.31]To my dearest Travis the Great.
[196:47.69]Hi there, Travis the Great.
[196:49.71]I am the girl who loves you the most in the entire world.
[196:52.75]What the hell is going on?
[196:53.43]But in order to prove that I'm your number one fan, I need some kind of evidence.
[196:57.62]Because no matter how much I insist that I'm your number one, any other chick or bitch can approach you and say the exact same thing.
[197:04.80]That is why I've decided that I should become strong.
[197:08.95]By doing so, I knew that someday I'd be able to get closer to you.
[197:13.29]Putting my title as Travis the Great's number one fan on the line, I embarked on this path and ended up winning the National Student Assassin Championship.
[197:22.68]I really did my best.
[197:24.62]But you know, in hindsight, it was a cinch.
[197:27.66]I guess I'm just blessed.
[197:29.30]I could master in one day techniques that would take others years to do.
[197:33.80]Pretty awesome, right?
[197:35.49]And then I got greedy.
[197:37.49]A new urge, a vision, that just maybe I could win a fight against Travis the Great.
[197:43.28]Now my goal is to behead Travis the Great, therefore surpassing my hero.
[197:48.45]Oops, did I actually write that?
[197:51.11]It's kind of embarrassing, you know.
[197:53.13]Well, anyways, I've made up my mind.
[197:55.67]I made an oath.
[197:56.81]I won't be killed by anyone.
[197:58.69]I shall defeat Travis the Great in battle.
[198:01.27]Only then will Travis the Great become mine and mine only.
[198:05.09]Love, Travis the Great's number one fan, Kimmy Howell.
[198:09.79]Okay.
[198:14.33]Okay.
[198:15.37]So much for the dose of innocence.
[198:17.66]But you've got the bloodlust.
[198:19.34]I'm sure about that.
[198:20.80]The flute?
[198:21.42]Yeah.
[198:21.92]Flute weapon?
[198:22.34]I'm legit.
[198:23.04]And way tougher than I look.
[198:25.30]So, uh, don't hold back, okay?
[198:28.94]Because one mistake will mean you're over.
[198:32.39]Darth Maul!
[198:35.01]If you're trying to give me a headache, it's working.
[198:37.63]She was putting that thing in her mouth.
[198:38.93]Imagine hitting the wrong button.
[198:40.53]You're just dead.
[198:42.69]That's a really bad oopsie if you have potato chip fingers.
[198:45.13]That hurt.
[198:49.29]Can't block that shit?
[198:52.52]So this is Secret Lost?
[199:12.76]Cookies?
[199:14.70]I love cookies!
[199:17.54]Suplex?
[199:18.10]Suplex, suplex, suplex.
[199:21.00]Suplex!
[199:43.40]Ain't got nothing.
[199:45.62]Sorry.
[199:46.10]Looks like you're not good enough.
[199:50.14]Oh, look at that.
[199:51.44]Full moves.
[200:12.87]Show me what you're made of.
[200:16.18]I am.
[200:18.06]Currently kicking your ass.
[200:20.72]Dammit.
[200:21.28]Almost done.
[200:21.94]And there you go.
[200:39.64]Nice backflip, then.
[200:41.28]Take the boss dead.
[200:43.50]And there's Cheshire Trests over there.
[200:45.02]There are.
[200:45.38]There are two Cheshire Trests.
[200:52.61]This is a real fight with real consequences, sweetheart.
[200:58.91]Oh, fuck.
[201:03.06]Do it.
[201:03.84]Oof, that hurts.
[201:10.75]Travis the Great.
[201:16.17]Is he leaking?
[201:24.22]Screw this.
[201:25.14]I can't kill a co-ed.
[201:26.46]Come see me after you graduate and I'll school you again.
[201:35.44]Stake-up's brain, Omega Law's stake-up's brain.
[201:39.64]Why did I even say that?
[201:40.62]It's just another thing.
[201:41.68]It's another spammable saying.
[201:44.40]I missed those chest or chest?
[201:48.20]Oh, you're right.
[201:50.42]Not 100% for me.
[201:53.92]I'm gonna pee.

[211:05.99]And every point of damage I take, a community sub gets paid for.
[211:10.52]I'm just... I will never take a single hit in that game.

[229:52.70]Because no, I did not.
[229:53.94]Why would I ever say that?
[229:55.54]When did I say that?
[230:02.46]I was drunk when I said it.
[230:06.10]No, I said I will play the first game that people write.
[230:09.40]And somebody wrote Jump King.
[230:10.42]And then a thousand people wrote TF2.
[230:11.91]And they thought they were first, but they weren't.
[230:15.73]I don't think I remember that.
[230:25.59]You said Cinco de Mayo, TF2.
[230:27.55]No, I did not!
[230:29.67]No!

[231:31.84]He farted, ha ha ha.
[231:34.34]Oh my god, get that cleaver, where are you farting?
[231:44.41]That was easy.
[231:49.33]How can one chat be so wrong?

[231:54.99]Tell me.
[231:56.01]You're in it!
[231:58.90]Play TF2, play TF2, play TF2, play TF2.
[232:04.15]Let's see the validity of this.
[232:07.77]Uh, that's, you just, you clipped that from 35 seconds ago.
[232:14.51]Not a really good pace you're making here.
[232:20.93]Please.
[232:22.41]Mega lull.
[232:22.99]It's right there.
[232:23.65]What do you mean it's right there?

[232:26.95]I'm not going to... No!
[232:28.04]I'm not doing that.
[232:30.38]It's right there.
[232:32.88]It's close, but it doesn't matter how close it is.
[232:35.06]I'm not doing it.
[232:36.14]I promise.
[232:43.23]Nobody can come up with a clip of me saying this.
[232:45.75]Weird.
[232:52.54]Usually you guys are really, really quick about this.
[232:57.02]Not today, apparently.

[233:58.84]What is it?
[233:59.42]Say it.
[234:06.21]Oh, fuck.
[234:20.11]I said it's TF2.
[234:22.84]Um, but I- I- hold on.
[234:27.82]I didn't say I was gonna play this.
[234:31.06]On Tuesday.
[234:31.86]I drunkenly said, say any game, and then people wrote TF2 and I said, no.
[234:38.74]So, what are you talking about?
[234:40.04]That was like, a week ago.
[234:41.62]Holy shit, I'm gonna die.
[234:50.15]Get up!
[234:52.91]You're gonna knock me back to normal.
[234:57.19]Play TF2.
[235:03.82]Play TF2.
[235:04.88]Play TF2.
[235:06.88]Now... You said, do you play any game?
[235:10.40]I said, yeah, that night.
[235:11.52]And then I said, I don't want to play TF2.
[235:13.04]And I was like, and Jump King was the one I played.
[235:14.96]And I deleted my save file.
[235:29.41]Instead it was because of the download time?
[235:37.79]Yeah, it is.
[235:42.11]It's big.
[235:49.68]Get them all!
[235:51.21]Yes!
[236:00.54]That's a bad excuse.
[236:02.42]Oh, here.
[236:03.12]I've got a really good excuse for you.
[236:06.44]I don't want to play it.
[236:07.54]Okay.
[236:10.39]Let's go.
[236:10.99]Alright.
[236:12.49]We've got it.
[236:13.19]Alright.
[236:15.59]Is this like a fucking homework assignment that I didn't turn in?
[236:17.97]Damn it.
[236:33.55]It only takes 1 hour and 30 minutes to download.
[236:36.41]No, I can probably get it in like... No, alright.
[236:41.14]Silence.
[236:41.60]Silence.
[236:42.48]Silence.
[236:44.37]Silence.
[236:47.36]I don't want to play fucking TF2.
[236:49.90]I have no, no bone in my whole body right now wants to download and install and play Team Fortress.
[236:56.62]I don't have a bone in my body.
[236:58.79]Right now.
[236:59.43]That's like, that's, do that.
[237:00.87]No, that's not going to happen.
[237:02.73]I have to be honest and real with you.
[237:05.83]No, and no amount of dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
[237:07.97]Maybe he'll turn his face cam on and poop on us or whatever we're going to want him to do.
[237:11.38]Maybe he'll turn face cam on if we go dot, dot, dot.
[237:20.70]Nope.
[237:21.54]That's not going to happen.
[237:28.36]Oh, you said silence.
[237:29.64]Well, yes.
[237:30.60]Stay that way.
[237:34.77]I don't want to hear it.
[237:35.85]I don't want to hear it.
[237:37.39]I don't want to hear it.
[237:38.19]No, I like... Talk to me.
[237:49.72]You shouldn't be doing THC.
[237:52.12]It's a dose.
[237:53.70]It's a fucking like quarter dose I did like six hours ago.
[237:57.91]It was an excuse as to why I couldn't do a four-year-old's puzzle.
[238:15.71]Quarter ounce of it?
[238:16.77]No, it wasn't a quarter ounce.
[238:21.29]Alright, alright, no more.
[238:23.07]No more.
[238:23.53]I demand silence again.
[238:26.24]Who's this boss?
[238:48.25]That's a really good image there.
[238:54.62]It's just what it looks like through his glasses.
[238:57.62]Take him off, dude.
[239:20.93]He looks so stupid.
[239:29.08]It really is a Minecraft skin.
[239:44.13]Either that, or a Powerade bottle.
[239:59.01]What the hell?
[240:02.19]Flamethrower?
[240:02.95]Alright.
[240:10.66]Fight.
[240:11.34]Fight!
[240:12.38]Attack!
[240:27.57]Alright, what do you do?
[240:29.57]What do you move?
[240:30.41]Let's see, you got a... Oh boy, an overhead slash!
[240:35.63]Ooh, another overhead slash!
[240:37.54]Can't dodge it.
[240:38.34]Ooh, nice overhead slash!
[240:49.16]Ooh, magnetic!
[241:02.75]I dodged it?
[241:03.90]I think yeah, no I didn't.
[241:05.90]Alright, don't be cocky here.
[241:09.24]One, two, three, back it up.
[241:11.90]What the fuck?
[241:22.47]Emulator sounds.
[241:26.15]Tricked you, it's Egypt.
[241:27.15]Oh fuck, I'm gonna die.
[241:34.68]Push it out of the way, man.
[241:36.17]Oh, I'm dead.
[241:44.11]Run.
[241:47.26]Okay, it felt like I had a lot of health for a second there, and now I don't have any.
[241:52.78]What happened?
[241:56.48]I just got killed by a pyro.
[242:01.68]What the f?
[242:15.13]This is f'n stupid!
[242:25.84]Alright, this is f'n stupid!
[242:39.73]Can I dodge underneath this?
[242:40.93]I guess I can.
[242:44.03]I can do three and then... I can't tell if that's hurting me or not.
[242:51.42]Fuck that!
[243:07.99]Alright, get out, get out, get out.
[243:08.91]Get the fire, I think.
[243:09.85]Yep.
[243:10.15]Alright, and... Shit.
[243:23.50]What the fuck?
[243:32.68]Fire?
[243:33.30]Okay.
[243:37.82]Ooh, I caught it.
[243:39.54]Hey!
[243:41.50]I was spinning my hand around.
[243:48.20]Dude, I was spinning around like crazy.
[244:11.03]Fucking Drupal, I'm dead.
[244:18.08]Bagel?
[244:18.52]No, you gotta spin.
[244:19.50]You gotta spin it.
[244:20.94]I'm just gonna just run around in a circle.
[244:38.91]Yeah, that's not hitting him.
[244:42.47]How do I get away from that one, though?
[244:49.42]What if it's a board?
[244:51.70]There's so many stupid fucking boxes everywhere here.
[244:55.54]They just block your path.
[244:56.64]Let's destroy them all.
[244:58.78]Like, just cut the whole fucking place down before we even fight.
[245:02.47]Clear the Wii area.
[245:03.69]Didn't you learn anything?
[245:18.13]What is happening right now?
[245:22.91]I'm doing it!
[245:32.19]I can't block it.
[245:34.09]It's like when you move, the camera moves with you, so it's like just kind of all over the place.
[245:47.43]If you want to dodge to the left, it actually ends up making you dodge in a weird place that you don't want to go.
[245:58.81]I'm going to swing once and then run backwards.
[246:03.00]You have to get perfect dodges.
[246:17.01]Damn it
[246:41.56]Okay, is a perfect dodge actually hitting the dodge button or is it just sidestep?
[246:58.91]Sidestep.
[247:03.53]Kind of hard to even tell if I'm dodging.
[247:12.10]Let's see if I can... Nope.
[247:18.06]Sideslash is the one that's not dodgeable.
[247:21.80]I can't walk it, right?
[247:26.30]Dodge at the right time.
[247:27.32]Which would be... Rework.
[247:40.03]Dark Step is way harder in this game.
[247:41.98]Yeah, because isn't it like they raise their hand up and you... I've done it once or twice already.
[247:53.04]Do I even have the... Do you have to lock it or something or no?
[248:07.09]Eh, fuck it.
[248:07.45]I'll just run.
[248:16.81]This area sucks such ass.
[248:19.64]This area sucks such ass.
[248:21.32]A lot of S's in that one, I don't wonder.
[248:38.51]Say it ten times in a row.
[248:40.63]This area sucks ass.
[248:48.02]Maybe it's that one I have to dodge around?
[248:49.26]No, not really.
[248:54.56]These darks, I'm trying.
[248:56.84]It's just, you just hit left, right?
[248:58.50]Like, there's no... Do I have to press a button with it, or just hit left?
[249:02.10]I'm just getting close to death.
[249:07.48]That shit doesn't work, like, 50%.
[249:09.64]I just did the exact same thing I did last time I did it, and it didn't do anything.
[249:18.47]Alright, just kill me.
[249:24.50]Can your center bar see you naked?
[249:28.60]I don't know, can it?
[249:30.04]Alright, here we go.
[249:53.10]Get the fuck out of the way!
[249:54.88]Oh, this place sucks!
[249:56.02]There's fucking objects everywhere you just bump into!
[250:09.80]No, and I'm trying to dodge the other way, and you can't.
[250:13.50]You can't do that.
[250:14.46]Because your body... Fuck this place.
[250:35.20]I'm trying to dodge left, why is it going backwards?
[250:44.84]This is a mess.
[251:17.04]The dark stuff don't work.
[251:20.20]Okay, I'm
[251:36.34]Forget the dodge, just step in.
[251:38.24]Get the health chest.
[251:43.43]No, that wasn't a good run.
[251:53.48]I'm just going to cheese the fuck out of this boss because I hate this boss.
[251:56.32]I don't like it.
[251:57.74]I don't like his area.
[251:59.52]I don't like this boss.
[252:00.28]It's fucking stupid.
[252:01.48]It's stupid.
[252:02.34]It's fucking stupid.
[252:03.29]This boss is fucking stupid.
[252:04.49]The game is fucking stupid.
[252:05.99]Everything about this is stupid.
[252:28.42]DO ANOTHER FUCKING MOVE!
[252:30.56]WHAT THE HELL?!
[252:32.42]WHAT?! !
[253:06.22]Fire.
[253:13.31]Oh, my God.
[253:14.07]The fucking lock-on is just so stupid here.
[253:19.57]It's such a dumb fucking area where it just... Actually mad?
[253:27.14]Yeah!
[253:28.38]It's fucking stupid!
[253:43.61]What?
[253:45.01]Get up!
[254:11.68]Burn the gacha force disk.
[254:17.43]How do you actually avoid getting hit by that?
[254:21.59]You're actually burning.
[254:22.29]Oh my fucking god.
[254:23.83]Just run around in a circle, I think.
[254:24.91]I don't know.
[254:25.39]Is it working?
[254:27.53]God damn it.
[254:44.41]That was so loud.
[254:57.20]Get in the- Oh.
[255:00.89]My.
[255:01.73]God.
[255:01.85]Get- No, no, no, no.
[255:02.87]I want the health.
[255:06.61]Get these fucking boxes out of my way!
[255:10.15]Oh, he's starting to actually get mad.
[255:12.20]He's starting to actually get mad at me.
[255:16.06]Get the fuck out of here!
[255:27.40]Use the other sword?
[255:30.06]I'd love to see what video game I'm playing right now.
[255:32.31]Anybody have any fucking idea what game is going on on the screen?
[256:07.39]Get out of this fucking rope.
[256:09.89]Why are you in here?
[256:10.89]No, I'm trying to dodge backwards.
[256:16.06]What the fuck?
[256:18.78]Why is it making me dodge towards her?
[256:20.54]I'm trying to go.
[256:21.20]I'm hitting down on the fucking D-pad, man.
[256:35.03]Did that hit me through the cork and wall?
[256:39.01]Better not.
[256:44.35]Get away!
[256:47.67]You're already spraying fire?
[257:03.06]When did you start doing this?
[257:12.53]I... I... Okay!
[257:26.68]Stand up!
[257:32.00]Where the fuck am I?
[257:33.22]Just die!
[257:34.84]God damn it!
[257:38.03]Die!
[257:38.47]Ah!
[257:43.43]The fuck did you get that fire?
[257:55.28]Stupid, fucking stupid, fucking stupid, fucking stupid, fucking stupid, fucking stupid, fucking stupid, fucking stupid, fucking stupid.
[258:20.61]Alright, let's see that image.
[258:26.85]Fuck off.
[258:27.25]Fucking stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.
[258:36.46]What?
[258:37.38]What's a kid doing here?
[258:39.50]I'm going to kill you.
[258:42.48]What's that?
[258:45.95]Oh, that was a. Oh, the kid.
[258:54.70]It's perfect.
[259:09.51]It's absolutely permanent.
[259:11.05]Hey, Felantine Greggs, thanks for the five community subs.
[259:13.05]Thanks a lot.
[259:13.33]Five subs.
[259:34.25]Now you are ranked 24th.
[259:36.49]Still a ways to go until the top.
[259:38.85]You are not getting tired?
[259:40.13]Huh.
[259:41.32]I haven't even broken a sweat.
[259:43.44]Why don't you bring me a real challenge?
[259:45.20]24.
[259:45.70]Omega low.
[259:46.84]Fuck that boss.
[260:00.41]That boss was dumb.
[260:04.31]I will not let anybody sit here and tell me that that boss wasn't dumb.
[260:10.32]Dumb.
[260:10.82]Hold on.
[260:11.58]Dumb.
[260:12.42]That was very dumb.
[260:19.44]I can go lower.
[260:24.09]Alright.
[260:37.98]Go lower than that?
[260:40.12]Alex Jones!
[261:03.39]Yeah Fifty people left when you did that?
[261:04.85]Whatever
[261:33.99]They'll be back when I get to the last boss and beat it in three swings.
[261:37.97]Travis, it's me.
[261:40.29]I have set up your next battle.
[261:42.49]Check out the map and go when you please.
[261:44.97]Oh, and by the way, I thought that was her face for a second.
[261:47.52]I just thought that was like her head and neck.
[261:51.42]The association can pay for everyone.
[261:53.72]I was looking over at you guys and I was like, oh, that's her head.
[261:56.44]Hold up.
[261:56.94]I'm shelling out all this cash and you can't bring the bus fare?
[261:59.89]I'm Vicky.

[263:25.00]Oh, because I was going up, up, up.
[263:39.28]Frito Man!
[263:40.76]Thanks for the hundred bucks, Frito Man.
[263:43.06]And they say...
[263:47.22]That's a huge amount of money, Mr. Frito.
[263:49.00]That won't be cool.
[263:50.14]It's a fun game.
[264:13.55]I gotta break my record. 26!
[264:45.96]You just lost almost a full pound.
[264:50.08]Alright.
[264:51.86]Let's play.
[264:59.30]Thank you, FritoMan, for the, uh, we're living in a weird simulated world.
[265:07.10]Thanks for the 10,000 bits.
[265:07.98]Thanks for the 100 bucks.
[265:08.98]You just gave it to me, and I'm gonna use it on Gacha Force figurines.

[265:29.20]Isn't a cat, what, 12?
[265:32.72]15?
[265:32.74]12 pounds?
[265:33.80]10 to 14?
[265:35.86]10 pounds?
[265:36.18]Yeah, I said like 12.
[265:53.54]Alright, let's go with just more minigames.
[265:54.80]The funnest part of this whole entire franchise.
[265:57.38]Do they have these in the PC one?
[266:04.09]Getting Trashed is now available.
[266:05.47]Okay, Getting Trashed.
[266:21.19]We cleaned our streets by rocketing all of our garbage into space.
[266:25.11]It worked like a charm, but now the trash could fall back to Earth and kill us.
[266:28.70]We don't really... didn't really think of that through.
[266:30.82]Will you go into space and collect the floating junk?
[266:34.30]Have all the debris floating in space and store it in your space shuttle.
[266:38.24]They'll dump it in the ocean or something later.
[266:40.66]Use your air jet booster to control your position.
[266:42.63]It takes some skill.
[266:43.37]If you get too close to Earth's atmosphere, you'll be pulled in by the gravity.
[266:47.69]Be careful.
[266:54.14]I'll be careful.
[266:55.98]Getting trashed.
[266:57.34]Turn on air boosters.
[266:58.36]Release.
[266:59.90]Control boost direction.
[267:04.65]Alright.
[267:07.45]How do you... How do you grab stuff?
[267:31.61]Can I put it in?
[267:34.11]Release.
[267:35.69]This one's kind of fun.
[267:38.15]You're bad at it.
[267:40.21]Oh.
[267:40.53]Oh, am I?
[268:07.90]Alright, I'll play this, but I won't play Super Frog.
[268:13.03]This is a minigame inside of another game!
[268:16.07]Get in there quick!
[268:32.29]gravity suck for the meatball I see him I got a meat boost yeah that was pretty
[269:05.15]Ten thousand?
[269:05.97]Did you guys ever wish that Isaac Newton didn't invent gravity?
[269:15.43]What?
[269:16.48]He didn't invent it.
[269:18.76]He patented it.
[269:19.96]Has anybody had a patent on gravity?
[269:22.12]Well, this sucks.

[271:08.80]Done.
[271:11.28]How's the booger wall story?
[271:16.82]No!
[271:17.14]Where?
[271:17.46]Oh, no!
[271:18.04]It's another stage!

[271:36.95]This one.
[271:56.02]Can you tell us that Skurr's apartment is a jungle story?
[272:04.06]Grandpa really does tell the same five stories.
[272:08.78]The kids, all the kids at Christmas just want to know when he threw up in his mom's bed that time.
[272:14.39]Got you.
[272:22.05]Alright.
[272:24.49]Got you.
[272:26.24]Tell us the Super Frog story, please.
[272:29.30]One time, I bought a game that said there was almost a million games in it, and it wasn't correct.
[272:36.92]It only had, like, a hundred.
[272:39.65]One of those games was a game called Super Frog, and I thought it was really cool.
[272:43.71]Best game on the disk.
[272:52.74]That was a very generous rounding.
[272:54.00]700,000 to 1,000,000.
[272:54.50]Eh, but he's still... Yeah.
[272:56.34]Uh, yeah.
[272:56.60]He's gonna make a ton of money.
[273:21.85]Nice.

[275:21.26]No.
[275:24.82]Online spin class.
[275:26.76]Online pottery classes with Bugleberry.

[276:27.43]Oh.

[276:29.09]Oh my god!
[276:29.91]Damn it!

[277:14.75]Yay!
[277:15.19]Thank god.
[277:19.25]That's not even the hardest one.
[277:20.15]Alright, let's get the beam katana upgrade.

[277:58.54]You got, what, 300... How much is this?
[277:59.50]Ugh.
[277:59.64]It's $300,000.
[278:00.70]I can get that.
[278:01.10]I can make that.
[278:11.72]I'll just make hamburgers for a while.
[278:25.82]Lay the pipe.
[278:27.48]Coconut grabber.
[278:29.10]Eat so with a vengeance.
[278:33.22]Hmm.
[278:34.84]Hmm.
[278:45.60]Do you need revenge?
[278:47.78]Yeah, I'll do the other one after this.

[309:12.61]It's hard to...
[309:34.90]Even retar- I- I'm not gonna fucking make it, am I?
[309:43.50]Too slow.
[309:45.42]No, it's too fast!
[310:06.68]You have to pull as hard as you can to the other side, but if you're not in the right spot when the road just rips in a direction, you're gonna get fucking crushed.

[312:16.38]Kind of.
[312:24.06]Can you match this pitch?
[312:30.61]Probably not.

[314:23.16]Is there an appeal there?
[314:23.88]Like, what is it about it?
[314:34.32]Blue.
[314:34.79]Would you guys eat a purple steak?
[314:37.81]If the top and bottom was seared and inside was purple, would you eat it?
[314:45.89]Oh, yes.
[314:46.47]It'll melt in your mouth.
[314:48.65]I don't feel like it would.
[314:58.03]Is it grape flavored?
[314:59.49]I don't know.
[315:00.17]Why would it be grape flavored steak?
[315:10.16]And well done.
[315:15.00]It's a purple steak.
[315:18.30]Yo!

[316:53.16]Um, in Who'sville.
[317:01.19]Is that enough money?
[317:02.71]It's not enough money.
[317:03.27]I need to go suck up like a few bugs.
[317:23.77]We tried a dodo steak.

[318:15.49]Uh-huh.
[318:20.25]They mean well done.
[318:22.71]What?
[318:23.53]That's not what they meant?
[318:33.41]This reminds me of the Ghostbusters game.
[318:36.98]Holy shit!
[318:41.22]That was horrible.
[318:42.50]That hurt me looking at that.
[318:52.89]Change the subject?
[318:53.65]What do you mean?
[319:05.82]I have enough money, but why does it keep going?

[321:12.90]It's gonna happen.
[321:18.72]Have like a toilet flush ten times.
[321:21.46]Because you wouldn't even have to get up to go to the bathroom.
[321:27.10]You could just piss right into the ball.
[321:28.76]I wouldn't have to get up.
[321:30.38]I would just mute my microphone and make sure that the camera's on.
[321:47.33]What?
[321:48.09]The camera?
[321:48.75]Okay.
[321:54.26]The peony.
[321:56.40]Buy it.
[321:58.87]Alright.
[322:07.01]Let's go do... Has it really been five and a half hours?
[322:10.36]Damn.
[322:11.74]Time just kind of screamed by.
[322:13.82]Holy shit.
[322:15.22]Time flies when you have the time.
[322:35.68]Oh, right.
[322:38.28]Get new clothes?
[322:49.29]McDonald's.
[322:52.35]I don't want new clothes, though.
[322:53.23]I like the clothes I have now.
[322:55.72]I just spend all my money.
[323:03.95]These threads suck.
[323:10.85]I don't have enough money for this.
[323:20.38]I'll take it.
[323:21.78]That's all I can afford.
[323:22.46]Can I get purple pants?
[323:29.97]Alright, that looks good.
[323:37.91]He's the Joker now.
[323:38.97]I'm sure there's been a version that looks just like this.
[323:43.35]Sorry, I had to mute.
[323:55.06]Alright, ranking battle.
[323:55.82]Let's do this.
[323:58.58]Try our new weapon.
[324:01.29]And then after this, I'm going to call the stream and I'll see you tomorrow.
[324:04.91]Do it again.
[324:13.18]Infiltrate the prison island.
[324:15.04]Slip past the tight security if you're seeing you're dead.
[324:17.11]Wait, do I... Am I accidentally doing this?
[324:35.84]Guys, he's over here!
[324:38.38]Guys, he's over here!
[324:39.82]Hey, what's up?
[324:40.66]Hey, what's up?
[324:44.12]Thought I said I was dead.
[324:52.17]Am I dead?
[324:53.39]Don't think so.
[324:57.42]Yeah, I'm fine.
[325:13.52]Never been better.
[325:25.07]Uh, this is not the right weapon.
[325:29.19]Hold on.
[325:29.55]I gotta run away.
[325:30.57]Oh my god.
[325:31.39]Please move the camera.
[325:33.03]Please move the camera.
[325:35.77]Please.
[325:36.16]You fucking, you fucking, you fucking with me?
[325:53.71]Ooh, it's orange Okay, let's go Where the fuck is he?
[325:59.77]This thing is slow
[326:19.48]This is a heavy two-hander.
[326:22.40]Damn, they only even hit me one time.
[326:26.03]One hit and they're dead?
[326:45.60]Wow, this thing's insane.
[326:47.00]Anybody else alive?
[326:49.28]This thing is nice.
[327:07.63]Oh yes, time for a tiger.
[327:40.08]Now we kill everyone.
[327:45.34]I think that's it.
[327:46.22]Oh, no, one more.
[327:46.71]Come here!
[327:52.89]Yeah!
[327:53.25]Alright, out of tiger mode.
[328:01.05]Okay, no more tiger mode.
[328:17.90]I need health?
[328:18.94]That's important.
[328:25.80]Why was it so hard for me to do that?
[328:30.86]Yeah, full health, good.
[328:32.43]Okay, easy.
[328:42.34]Okay... Come here!
[328:48.55]I'm out of my time!
[328:52.73]It's so slow, but it's so good.
[329:04.80]Alright, run!
[329:09.83]It's so much fun just to slash people with this thing.
[329:15.47]Ooh, yes.
[329:22.00]A lot of health.
[329:23.28]Kill!
[329:24.96]Kill!
[329:42.35]Holy shit.
[329:43.31]I don't even know what's happening, but it seems to be working.
[329:48.15]Don't let him shoot me.
[329:49.22]Go, go, go, go!
[330:18.30]This thing is so crazy.
[330:23.12]More?
[330:23.66]What's happening now?
[330:26.90]Holy shit.
[330:27.76]Did I win?
[330:38.11]Peony's a lot of fun.
[330:39.09]It really is.
[330:39.61]This thing's great.
[330:41.37]Wait.
[330:42.07]It's... Trinkets.
[330:44.45]Did I get all the Trinkets?
[330:48.15]I think so.
[330:50.87]What about Wind Roar?
[331:07.05]Reset.
[331:08.67]Pain.
[331:09.33]I gotta look at these cards.
[331:17.33]Winrar.
[331:22.49]Pain Blastenberry?
[331:26.03]What's that?
[331:41.29]Yeah, I can do a charge shot on this too, right?
[331:42.91]Let's see what it looks like.
[331:45.72]It's pretty insane.
[331:46.58]That's a stupid range!
[332:07.57]I think I cleaned the whole thing up.
[332:53.48]Just swinging wildly in every direction.
[332:58.46]Being his best item.
[332:59.90]You're a pain.
[333:00.39]What a joke.
[333:04.23]You're a pain.
[333:04.91]Go ahead.
[333:31.76]I'm gonna hit you with a nut!
[333:34.31]I'm gonna hit you with a nut!
[333:35.67]I forgot about that one.
[333:37.11]Yeah, that's not in here.
[333:38.17]Okay.
[333:39.33]It's time to save.
[333:55.75]Fight time.
[334:04.81]Big cheese pizza?
[334:06.39]No, save the game, please.
[334:15.78]Oh, that's a bunch of gross noises.
[334:17.94]I didn't want to hear.
[334:18.52]Ah...
[334:28.01]What's the game time?
[334:30.63]533?
[334:30.65]My streams on live are 535.
[334:32.89]Wow.
[334:33.83]I'm going to sneeze.
[334:35.07]This is what I can do about it.
[334:36.25]I think I got it.
[334:37.79]This is what I can do about it.
[334:39.08]Got it.
[334:56.88]So the damsel's in here.
[335:07.59]I already don't like this.
[335:12.59]Chicks put out for their rescuers, right?
[335:23.22]You know, you're lucky I don't have a bondage kick.
[335:41.19]Acid spit.
[335:43.35]What are you doing in there?
[336:00.40]You'd be even more dashing if you were writhing in agony.
[336:04.88]Come closer to me.
[336:07.26]Huh?
[336:07.40]No, no, no.
[336:07.76]Don't let her touch you.
[336:08.36]Don't let her touch you.
[336:08.88]What are you doing?
[336:09.28]Show me your face twisted in pain.
[336:11.69]My body.
[336:21.49]Yeah, that's right.
[336:22.87]The peony.
[336:35.83]Poison?
[336:37.51]How do I get poison off?
[336:39.69]Oh no.
[336:40.43]Okay.
[336:41.17]Is there a run I can do?
[336:44.21]Get away!
[336:44.75]This is just me what I look like when I play VR.
[336:49.93]Where's the antidote?
[336:56.00]Alright, heal.
[337:01.38]Stay away from the gas.
[337:03.80]See you in a- Don't touch the gas.
[337:19.26]Now that I get the R.P.
[337:20.88]in me, this game just got way easier.
[337:23.02]What are you gonna do?
[337:24.28]I spent $300,000 on this.
[337:24.90]I did mini-games for like two hours.
[337:31.39]Look at the fruits of my labor.
[337:32.56]Bosses don't mean shit.
[337:36.08]Alright, just go.
[338:03.65]She's dead?
[338:04.07]Did I really just kick the shit out of this lady with the peony?
[338:08.31]Alright, I'm gonna do a sloppy hit to win.
[338:13.26]Oh, sorry.
[338:16.10]Dead.
[338:18.10]Oh, did I bump you?
[338:23.24]What are you doing?
[338:24.44]Don't come in the room.
[338:25.16]Don't knock on the door before you come in the room.
[338:26.95]What the fuck?
[338:27.51]Are you alright?
[338:45.34]I didn't even know their name Chloe Walsh That weapon is unbelievable You are not ranked 23rd
[339:03.38]Nice.
[339:03.84]What the hell?
[339:05.68]Dodge, duck.
[339:30.85]What the hell?
[339:31.21]That was bullshit.
[339:39.61]I got the best weapon in the game.
[339:41.83]I spent the money.
[339:42.45]I did the work and I spent the money.
[339:46.90]The new minigames?
[339:48.56]I love these games.
[339:49.36]They're so much fun.
[339:54.08]Huh.
[340:03.95]Okay.
[340:06.52]Here comes a Scorpion minigame, is that real?
[340:16.30]I'll take care of the cat, don't worry.
[340:18.80]Don't build things up.
[340:19.90]Just tell me already.
[340:21.55]Get your dumb ass to my office now.
[340:37.32]Don't listen to me.
[340:37.86]Bought this sword with his inheritance.
[340:41.46]How did you get a $300,000 inheritance?
[340:44.28]And you buy a beam katana replica?
[340:52.88]Watch the anime.
[340:53.47]We already did.
[340:53.89]Alright, cat.
[340:59.94]16.3 pounds.
[341:00.30]Let's go.
[341:02.10]Get it.
[341:02.66]151.
[341:03.92]That was huge.
[341:10.11]Got more leaf.
[341:35.96].3 pounds.
[341:36.46]Okay, do some stretching.
[341:39.85]That was close.
[342:04.13]Fine, I'm not breaking anybody's spine.
[342:06.73]You're a lot 13 can I look at them?
[342:09.53]Okay Oh
[342:15.36]Alright, now it's time for a massage.
[342:17.16]Cut.
[342:18.30]Keep going.
[342:40.42]I don't think I'm gonna break any records, but I'll do okay.
[342:43.08]Yes, this is my speaking voice now.
[342:46.40]This cat is paralyzed with fear.
[342:54.91]Rigor mortis is setting in.
[343:01.79]Stop.
[343:22.89]Get it.
[343:23.83]Yeah.
[343:26.33]Alright, 13.9 pounds.
[343:30.59]I eat the highest quality food.
[343:37.90]There we go.
[343:39.60]Look at how fat you were when we first started.
[343:41.88]Alright, do we get any new minigames?
[343:46.31]I just only care about that right now.
[343:52.89]Yes.
[343:54.05]Sting So Good is now available.
[343:55.83]I just want to see what it is.
[344:03.05]I just want to see.
[344:04.25]And then we'll come back tomorrow.
[344:06.75]This is the absolute worst one.
[344:18.62]It's the worst in the first game, too.
[344:21.68]Hey!
[344:25.46]Wait a minute.
[344:31.58]What?
[344:35.50]What is this bullshit?
[344:36.38]It's not a minigame?
[344:37.74]It's a... This sucks.
[344:48.17]This is intentional.
[344:51.13]Gotcha.
[344:54.77]That was a blue scorpion.
[344:55.83]Is that worth more?
[344:56.47]Who are the scorpions?
[345:13.97]Gross.
[345:23.38]Okay, I'm fine.
[345:26.06]Couldn't you sprint?
[345:29.83]Pick!
[345:34.49]Pick it up!
[345:36.77]Oh my god, pick him up!
[345:51.75]I can't use this more than once.
[345:52.67]But we saw this one.
[345:54.84]I won't be playing this one ever again.
[345:56.98]Cool.
[345:57.56]Alright.
[346:11.94]One more out of the gym.
[346:13.94]See you tomorrow.
[346:16.86]I hate you with all of my hatred.
[346:20.44]Let's see you tomorrow.
[346:24.24]This is the worst game.
[346:27.28]What?
[346:30.54]Oh, I don't have any money.
[346:31.56]We'll have to pick this up tomorrow.
[346:33.56]Alright.
[346:35.04]I'll see you guys tomorrow for more No More Heroes 2.
[346:37.05]Gonna keep playing it.
[346:39.23]I think it's a lot of fun.
[346:41.13]It's very quality.
[346:47.06]This puts us right exactly at about the five to six hour mark, which is exactly what I thought was going to happen.
[346:51.32]That's good.
[346:54.13]I'm ready.
[346:56.29]Better play more.
[346:56.85]We're playing tomorrow.
[346:59.25]Thanks for joining me.
[346:59.85]Hope you had fun.
[347:00.91]I did.
[347:02.83]We'll see you tomorrow.
[347:05.31]Those of you sticking around, we'll do the bits.
[347:07.45]Hang out with the subs.
[347:11.22]I'm going to keep this song up.
[347:13.20]Why not?
[347:16.73]No, I'm not really into the Homestar Runner thing.
[347:20.29]It just doesn't do it for me.
[347:21.23]But Wallace and Gromit, though, got me interested.
[347:47.03]You do have me interested in Wallace and Gromit, of course.
[347:54.09]Probably very easy.
[347:56.01]Designed for children.
[348:00.39]So, maybe I'll try it.
[348:03.57]Hey Gnarly, thanks for the $2.50.
[348:04.57]Speaking of games you haven't played yet that you intend to, are you still going to stream Chrono Trigger?
[348:11.36]Yes.
[348:12.60]Just not immediately.
[348:13.52]Not right now.
[348:16.84]There are a couple of sequels that we have to get through.
[348:19.14]There are a couple games that I really need to beat and be done with.
[348:22.22]This is one of them.
[348:25.42]I've been putting this one off for months.
[348:27.36]I'm happy to play it.
[348:29.59]One game at a time.
[348:30.41]And then Resident Evil 3 is after this.
[348:32.21]So I've got quite a backlog.
[348:39.23]Let's see.
[348:39.53]What was the thing?
[348:40.19]Oh, Tiny Toon Adventures.
[348:42.11]My Summer Sports.
[348:45.01]Another one.
[348:45.80]That has to happen immediately.
[348:46.82]Yeah.
[348:53.12]Hey, Smelly Boy, thanks for the $2.50.
[348:54.60]What do you think is the worst chat?
[348:56.08]We hate this game?
[348:58.66]What do you think is the worst chat we hate this game saying?
[349:01.19]Veto or Next?
[349:03.63]Also, please bring back Next.
[349:06.97]Next is way worse because I created that.
[349:10.12]That's my own fault.
[349:12.10]Veto is just, hey, I'm going to veto this.
[349:14.42]Oh, you're going to veto that.
[349:15.56]Next was like a joke that I created that monster with the fucking iPad stream.
[349:26.13]That's where it came from.
[349:26.97]So I would say Next.
[349:35.10]That emote existed for less than 30 days.
[349:38.38]No, no, no.
[349:43.54]A whimsical moose thanks to the 250.
[349:46.21]I've been waiting for this for three months.
[349:48.01]I'm really excited for three.
[349:49.77]And I'm 99% sure that Travis will be in Smash.
[349:53.27]I believe that as well.
[349:55.75]I think Travis will be one of the DLC characters.
[350:01.51]I'm pretty sure that'll happen.
[350:04.96]Followed by the Three Stooges.
[350:08.15]As one character.
[350:14.51]What if they did the Three Stooges?
[350:17.21]And it was the first three characters.
[350:19.47]It was Moe, Curly, then Larry for 1, 2, and 3 in the Fighter's Pass.
[350:24.16]Can you refund the Fighter's Pass?
[350:37.95]Thank you.
[351:05.42]Thank you, Freakout, for the $5.
[351:06.82]Don't forget about the secret boss, Jerma.
[351:08.62]I got the secret boss.
[351:11.66]Here's a detailed description of where to get that boss.
[351:18.45]And then they list a bunch of songs.
[351:21.21]Okay, thanks for the $5.
[351:27.10]Which of the normal music-wise are you freaking out?
[351:34.70]Back to our Star Wars.
[351:36.17]Is this not good?
[351:37.39]You don't like it?
[351:38.79]What's wrong with it?
[351:45.85]Better?
[351:48.97]Better?
[351:52.84]More normal?
[351:53.38]More relaxing?
[351:59.28]Freaking the fuck out.
[352:03.63]But thanks for the five bucks.
[352:06.15]Hey, Christmas95, thanks for the $10,000 bits.
[352:09.61]His brain?
[352:11.03]No.
[352:11.77]His heart.
[352:13.39]With a big heart.
[352:18.43]Sometimes I feel like they're replaced.
[352:20.53]Sometimes I feel like my brain is down here in the middle of the chest, and my heart is up in the brain.
[352:26.59]And then it's way bigger up there.
[352:28.80]And then the brain is tiny.
[352:29.96]It's like the size of the heart.
[352:32.32]They flipped.
[352:32.78]They're in the wrong places.
[352:39.62]No, and actually, I don't mean that as... My heart is so big, it, like, replaces my brain.
[352:44.72]I'm so... I love everything, and I want to make sure everyone... No, no, no.
[352:49.93]I'm not talking about that.
[352:50.83]I'm just talking about, I think, like, just physically speaking, it's way larger than my brain is.
[352:59.56]He's hippie Jerva.
[353:02.26]Dude, my heart is so much bigger than my brain.
[353:05.64]God, it gets me in trouble sometimes.
[353:12.29]I care too much about stuff.
[353:16.01]That would explain the Tetris part.
[353:21.74]Hey, Swiggity Swanky, thanks for 250.
[353:23.58]Nice, happy Venus meter.
[353:26.44]Oh, you're a weapon.
[353:31.45]Noodle is bad at gaming, thanks for a thousand bits.
[353:34.34]Since we're quarantined, I haven't actually been buying anything, so I have more money to dump on my favorite streamers.
[353:40.12]On another note, this is giving me flashbacks to laughing my ass off in the bath, hearing you read my sex dream message out loud on the New Year's Eve No More Heroes stream.
[353:57.00]Yeah.
[353:58.50]Yep.
[354:02.23]Thank you NoodleIsBadAtGaming for the thousand bits.
[354:04.70]Ten dollars.
[354:06.92]Seriously though, eight dollar large is a steal.
[354:08.36]Especially since Little Caesars is five to six dollars and it isn't even fresh.
[354:26.62]What do you want me to tell you?
[354:27.94]You want me to rebuttal that?
[354:30.58]I can't.
[354:31.94]I can't.
[354:35.55]It's $8 for a large pizza.
[354:36.73]That's not worth it.
[354:39.73]It probably is.
[354:41.25]What am I going to say?
[354:41.83]No?
[354:45.67]In some places, it's like $16, $17 for a large.
[354:47.15]It's like $15 plus for a large in a lot of places.
[354:56.84]Do I like dominoes?
[354:57.94]No.
[354:58.92]Do I think dominoes is gross?
[355:00.90]Eh, maybe kind of.
[355:03.20]If I was presented with dominoes and was said, hey, I got dominoes.
[355:07.32]I'd be like, okay, this is fine.
[355:08.84]I'll eat it.
[355:11.64]Do I love?
[355:12.14]No, I don't love it.
[355:13.24]I don't hate it.
[355:14.84]I think it's good.
[355:19.75]Thanks for the, thanks for the, uh, thanks for the $2.50.
[355:25.05]It's fine, yeah.
[355:27.25]Hey, alum, thanks for the $5.
[355:28.85]No message, just $5.
[355:33.61]Leon X, thanks for $5.
[355:35.33]Psycho streamer cooks his food using his own body heat in his mouth.
[355:39.83]Oh, I just... Oh, is it a thought project?
[355:48.50]Just a thought project, man.
[355:53.46]I lost the...
[355:56.58]There it is.
[355:58.20]Pepper the Doctor, thanks for 10 bucks.
[356:00.90]I cannot stop watching this.
[356:02.34]What a legend.
[356:03.08]You do realize this, right?
[356:04.72]Thanks for all the entertainment.
[356:05.74]We really do appreciate it, boss.
[356:15.84]It's me falling down in the chair.
[356:20.79]We saw this the other day.
[356:22.13]It's me falling down in the chair.
[356:31.86]Wait, that was supposed to be that rap That's the part they're talking about
[357:02.93]Remember that.
[357:05.49]How many times have I fallen out a window?
[357:08.63]Is that a pretty normal occurrence?
[357:13.43]Thanks for the ten bucks.
[357:15.71]And then Pepper the Doctor.
[357:16.89]Again, three more dollars.
[357:18.03]I almost forgot.
[357:18.61]People at work are singing the We're Rats song.
[357:21.50]I asked them how they knew the song.
[357:23.40]Apparently it's becoming a popular TikTok meme song.
[357:26.14]Like I said, it's fucking legendary.
[357:29.80]Yeah, I... The rats are their own thing now.
[357:33.09]They've flown away.
[357:34.17]They've flown off.
[357:35.93]Some people know that it exists and they don't even know that I exist, which is fine.
[357:40.95]That's fine with me.
[357:43.69]It's taken on... It's its own thing now.
[357:46.11]It's... It's become its own little fun thing that people think is fun and cool.
[357:53.19]And I like that.
[357:53.71]I'm happy about that.
[357:59.00]So...
[358:00.56]People show me, hey, what do you think about this?
[358:01.78]This person put the rats here.
[358:02.98]This person said this about the rats.
[358:04.18]This person did a rat song.
[358:05.36]It's like, that's fucking cool.
[358:07.92]I'm happy that people are using it and playing with it and having fun with it.
[358:11.44]That makes me happy.
[358:18.51]Kim wants McDonald's.
[358:25.15]I don't think you can do that.
[358:31.94]It's food.
[358:33.20]We have food in the fridge.
[358:39.55]Alright, you guys realized something.
[358:42.41]If Kim and I were up to our own vices, we would eat McDonald's three times a week.
[358:48.40]I would eat McDonald's two or three times a week.
[358:51.72]If it was like... I mean, I guess I could, couldn't I?
[358:56.66]I could.
[358:57.00]I could.
[359:05.80]Do Americans really?
[359:06.88]Yeah, we love it.
[359:10.96]We love it.
[359:14.69]Tim and I get so excited going to McDonald's.
[359:17.65]You guys, everyone, oh, wow, I wonder what, like, expensive tastes this streamer has.
[359:22.91]I bet he eats lobsters and crab dips.
[359:28.46]No, no, we get excited in the drive-thru to McDonald's.
[359:33.72]That's what excites us.
[359:37.54]We don't wonder that.
[359:38.90]Well, now you do.
[359:41.26]Nobody wonders that.
[359:42.02]Yes, they do.
[359:43.16]Somebody does.
[359:44.56]I'm sure one of you did.
[359:45.38]One of you beamed that into my head.
[359:51.64]Expensive taste says the guy that loves steakums.
[359:54.24]We didn't think this.
[359:58.23]Oh, yeah.
[359:58.63]All the evidence has kind of just been there, huh?
[360:07.02]Whatever, who cares?
[360:08.58]I love McDonald's.
[360:11.32]I love that place.
[360:13.31]Back when I was a kid, there was like the play place.
[360:15.53]You could play there.
[360:16.39]There was like all kinds of toys.
[360:17.79]You could go in the ball pit and stuff.
[360:22.85]And then the hamburgers were awesome and the chicken nuggets.
[360:33.34]But I don't do this anymore.
[360:34.32]Why is everybody calling me a child?
[360:36.20]I don't go to the ball pit anymore.
[360:43.07]Oh god, I'm about to get fucking... I'm about to get roasted right now.
[360:48.03]Bingo Sunshine, thanks for the 250.
[360:49.84]Blaming CBD for making you misinterpret the position of the light blue block in the second image is like when teens give someone a joint with just plain grass in it so that they'll pretend they're getting high.
[361:02.11]Of course, as I was writing this you clarified that there is actually THC in the oil you're using, so I'm the clown.
[361:14.70]I was certain that there wasn't going to be any mind-using things today.
[361:18.30]McDonald's is beta fast food.
[361:24.31]That's unbelievable.
[361:25.15]Oh, come on.
[361:27.09]The Big Mac is the best thing ever.
[361:31.55]Now, if you weren't here, I have been small dosing CBD with THC in it.
[361:42.76]Or to try to shut my nerve pain up.
[361:51.50]Osteochondritis is incredibly annoying.
[361:54.69]Seeing if it works.
[361:56.51]Seeing if it calms it down a little bit.
[361:59.71]He's baby dosing.
[362:00.93]I'm not looking to get messed up.
[362:15.31]Weed.
[362:15.85]Laugh my ass off, I guess.
[362:17.71]He's micro-dosing weed.
[362:18.97]Yeah, I'm just using it for pain relief.
[362:23.65]I'm testing it to see if it helps me with pain relief.
[362:28.75]What's wrong with that?
[362:38.28]Is it working?
[362:39.44]I can't tell you that it is or isn't.
[362:41.48]Because I've only...
[362:44.66]It's only been something I've been doing for a couple of days.
[362:47.66]So, I'm going to see what small doses that this does every once in a while.
[362:53.18]See if it helps.
[362:53.64]We'll see.
[363:00.43]Smoke weed instead.
[363:01.31]I don't want that much EHC.
[363:06.15]I don't want that much.
[363:08.58]Because what I'm doing right now is only a couple of milligrams.
[363:13.82]So I don't really want... If you guys thought I had a problem with a children's puzzle today... I don't think I would be capable of live streaming.
[363:25.52]I mean, like, oh, when Gerber has a few drinks... Oh, yeah, he's drunk.
[363:30.02]He said... Oh, look what he did.
[363:32.36]Look what he's saying.
[363:33.16]Oh, look at the stream.
[363:34.08]It's fun.
[363:35.80]If I were to be, like, higher or something, I don't want to do that.
[363:38.98]That would be funny.
[363:40.70]I'm not sure that would work.
[363:43.73]I would forget I was streaming and sit here and just kind of... I wouldn't even talk to you guys.
[363:48.55]I'm not sure I want to do that.
[363:57.61]Of course he's a lightweight.
[363:58.57]He's 5'2".
[364:02.08]I don't want to take in a bunch of THC.
[364:09.59]I don't want to be completely screwed up.
[364:14.58]I'm using it for a therapeutic measure, not to talk about how big the solar system is.
[364:25.04]Although, what?
[364:25.44]We did that today.
[364:26.14]We talked about aliens, right?
[364:27.63]What did we talk about today?
[364:28.91]Something weird.
[364:31.19]We did that today.
[364:31.83]We did something weird today.
[364:34.71]What did I do?
[364:36.85]Long story short, we'll see how it goes in a week.
[364:40.05]find out a flat mctragic thanks for the five dollars Jerma enter the sun sundiverse the pseudiverse enter the pseudiverse you could replace half of the characters that pseudo comes up with with Jerma rumble characters it's kind of his Jerma rumble uh what do I want to make a mutant man
[365:09.46]There's a guy, there's a mutant.
[365:11.86]He's got horns coming out of his ass.
[365:14.44]Alright.
[365:14.84]Perfect.
[365:15.72]Can you guys, can we make that?
[365:16.75]I feel like that's kind of what he does.
[365:29.53]Yeah.
[365:31.17]Hey, Robofussin, thanks for the 250.
[365:33.78]You changed after that week-long CBD binge, bro.
[365:37.98]We never hang out anymore.
[365:39.00]You only come around asking for bits.
[365:40.98]Now I find out that you spent five figures on some carnival.
[365:44.93]That's some help, man.
[365:53.59]Goddammit.
[365:55.80]Fomenting dregs thanks for $20 2,000 bits I tried playing TF2 just out of curiosity recently after long absence had at least a thousand hours in the game prior and One guy was like have you played before when our team lost?
[366:12.05]So basically the community is what I remember if you rejoin it It will be like the chat Dude have you played before?
[366:26.05]No, you always say no.
[366:29.33]Don't get defensive to that.
[366:31.14]Say, no, this is my first time.
[366:32.48]Because then that person, from then on out, will... That you're at the bottom there.
[366:39.98]Anything you do after that would be like, oh, this guy's a fucking fast learner.
[366:44.14]Holy shit.
[366:45.78]He top-fragged?
[366:46.56]This is like his second game?
[366:47.58]Whoa.
[366:50.40]I respect this guy.
[366:53.12]And then 10 years later, when they're the best man at your wedding, you can tell them this story.
[367:00.09]Man, we were almost enemies.
[367:01.05]Thanks for the 20 bucks, though.
[367:12.97]Hey, ruined bloodline, thanks for the $5.
[367:14.72]Jerma, please say something funny.
[367:17.82]I lost almost all my money investing in Jerma stocks, and I need to make that money back.
[367:21.38]Please, I beg you.
[367:32.22]Trading Jerma... Jerma comedy currency.
[367:35.91]Because I am not a comedy advisor.
[367:39.95]I am not somebody to tell you when you should and should... Should and should not laugh at a joke.
[367:46.99]I can't tell you those things.
[367:48.44]You have to be in control of that, and you are.
[367:50.36]It has nothing to do with me.
[367:54.42]All I can say is...
[367:58.92]Nothing.
[367:59.96]I've said what I needed to say.
[368:02.84]Thanks for the $5.
[368:05.20]Trading.
[368:06.36]Just be careful.
[368:09.05]It's a wild world out there.
[368:14.35]Hey, SoupGG, thanks for the $2.50.
[368:16.79]Jerma, I enjoyed your Diablo II playthrough, but I think it had the worst joke of the decade.
[368:21.91]And no one's brought it up yet.
[368:23.63]It made me physically cringe when I heard it.
[368:26.53]What are you talking about?
[368:29.56]What's so bad about this?
[368:30.24]This is the worst joke of the decade?
[368:34.72]I don't know how new you are to the channel, but you're going to have an issue every single day.
[369:01.36]What you have just linked me, I believe happens 30 to 40 times an hour on this stream.
[369:09.74]I don't know.
[369:10.23]I'm not sure you're going to be... I'm not sure you're going to want to... How dare you?
[369:21.51]Those are the only jokes he makes.
[369:22.99]That's not even true.
[369:26.29]I make equal parts.
[369:28.23]Say a name and a noise.
[369:30.44]Versus like, and let me tell you this.
[369:33.64]Give me some credit here.
[369:34.58]I deserve it.
[369:35.42]I deserve this credit.
[369:37.90]50% of the jokes are a name and a place, a noun and a verb.
[369:42.64]Noun and a verb.
[369:43.94]Mr. Noun and a verb.
[369:45.18]Mr. Verb and a noun.
[369:46.74]Yeah.
[369:46.92]Okay.
[369:47.20]Yeah.
[369:47.88]But the other half are carefully crafted scenarios and crafted comedy.
[370:00.64]Don't forget being bad at the game and ranting like an idiot.
[370:04.27]No, ranting like a philosopher.
[370:16.38]Being bad at the game is not on purpose.
[370:23.64]Is it making me realize the Jerm is always high?
[370:29.63]No, I'm not.
[370:31.86]Alright, let's do the credits.
[370:38.34]Oh, that's right.
[370:38.88]Streamlabs was done.
[370:40.90]I tried to do this before.
[370:42.67]Is Streamlabs still dead?
[370:45.57]Dude, Streamlabs is still dead.
[370:49.29]I can't... Yeah, it's dead.
[370:51.81]I cannot roll the credits.
[370:55.22]Come on, why can't I get on here?
[371:02.86]Wait, hold on.
[371:04.49]Is it working?
[371:10.65]Jerma gnome.
[371:12.35]Y'all, enough of you saying it.
[371:13.49]Let's see it.
[371:18.29]Name the gnome.
[371:21.55]That's not funny.
[371:22.95]Okay.
[371:26.71]You laughed at it.
[371:27.27]You laughed at a friendship over.
[371:30.09]You laughed at a friendship over.
[371:32.28]Done.
[371:33.06]Done.
[371:35.02]Done.
[371:36.20]No more friend.
[371:44.17]That's it.
[371:45.03]I've had enough.
[371:46.75]No more.
[371:52.63]No.
[371:54.67]Show the clip.
[371:55.42]No.
[371:56.26]You show the clip.
[371:59.07]Turn around.
[371:59.57]What, you can't even see the person behind you?
[372:01.27]Mr. Spaghetti!
[372:02.51]Mr. Spaghetti!
[372:05.47]What's wrong with that?
[372:09.00]I don't see a problem with this.
[372:13.62]Yeah, you can tell Joel that the life-size cardboard cutout that I have that I painted of him, sculpture of him, out of clay.
[372:24.70]That I just finished painting and it just came out of the... I just baked it.
[372:27.71]I was going to send it to him.
[372:30.47]Not anymore.
[372:30.89]So I'm going to melt it down and turn it into a bunch of pencils.
[372:41.89]You can tell him.
[372:43.47]Go ahead, y'all.
[372:43.89]Go ahead.
[372:44.17]You can tell him.
[372:52.66]I'm going to say spaghetti.
[372:54.56]Sell it to us instead.
[373:01.62]Why am I... Okay.
[373:05.37]Now, I saw the clip.
[373:06.71]It was a funny clip.
[373:09.51]Joel... I'll see you in Morrowind multiplayer.
[373:15.31]One-on-one PvP.
[373:19.25]Long swords only.
[373:20.61]Can you even do this?
[373:23.75]I turned the music off accidentally.
[373:27.66]Long swords only.
[373:30.18]We'll find out how much of a gnome I am.
[373:34.58]We'll see.
[373:37.90]This dude can handle a long sword pretty well.
[373:41.17]Can you?
[373:42.01]We'll find out.
[373:42.49]On the stream that will never happen.
[373:48.07]That means Joel and I have to
[373:51.02]Do it.
[373:52.12]And... We'll see if that happens.
[373:56.35]Hey, C4G, thanks for the 250.
[373:57.87]I miss Animal Crossing.
[373:59.19]Can you bring her back, please?
[374:00.81]I miss her so much.
[374:01.57]I miss Animal Crossing.
[374:02.91]Thank you, sir.
[374:03.99]Uh... No.
[374:04.63]Remember that?
[374:06.63]We're gonna do the bitch and I'm gonna fuckin' do... Play Animal Crossing.
[374:09.30]That ended during the move when it's the only thing me and Kim had to do.
[374:14.16]And now it's done.
[374:16.76]Played it twice.
[374:23.17]On stream, I played it twice.
[374:25.55]Off stream, I played it probably a couple dozen times.
[374:33.62]Hey, Control X, thanks for the 420.
[374:34.96]Thanks for the stream, Jerry.
[374:37.94]Uh, being a HEMA fencer who can't sword fight due to Corona, it's refreshing to see some epic lightsaber on action.
[374:47.82]Bernie, yeah.
[374:49.36]I'm excited for the 420 Easy Bake Mouth Oven Microdose LSD stream, which is tomorrow.
[374:55.31]Cinco de Mayo 2020.
[374:57.37]Anyway, spam this heart to make Jerva fart.
[375:09.25]420 Easy Bake Mouth Oven Microdose LSD Stream.
[375:15.38]I feel like I want to have that.
[375:18.18]I want that to be the title of the stream.
[375:20.68]Will I get into trouble if I have that be the title?
[375:25.20]I feel like somebody would be not happy about that.
[375:29.93]420 Easy Baked Mouth Oven Microdose LSD Stream.
[375:36.41]I'm going to run that by Twitch to see if I can fucking have that.
[375:41.12]Probably not.
[375:45.22]Thanks for the $4.20.
[375:46.66]Thanks for the best title of that stream.
[375:51.69]Oh, by the way, you guys will be pleased to know, all the packets, I have probably 20 packets of different foods and items.
[376:01.37]None of them are expired.
[376:02.61]They're all good to go.
[376:03.29]They don't expire until 2021.
[376:04.01]So I can eat them.
[376:05.57]Can't wait.
[376:11.77]Alright, can I get this to work?
[376:12.69]Let's see.
[376:12.99]Will it work?
[376:16.55]Leave it at that.
[376:21.77]And credits.
[376:24.72]Oh, you're not going to work?
[376:27.52]Come on, everyone's waiting.
[376:31.12]That's, um... Doesn't seem correct.
[376:36.20]That's just one person subbed?
[376:40.89]What is this?
[376:42.83]Did anybody sub?
[376:49.03]What are we looking at here?
[376:52.13]Tonight's sub.
[376:56.78]Well, I can read them.
[377:13.04]Thank you, guys.
[377:15.72]What's going on with this thing?
[377:23.69]Tomalong1.
[377:27.11]Metal something.
[377:28.39]Thanks for the subs.
[377:30.53]I can get them all!
[377:32.05]Yordle, Tickle, Roll, Lars, Bloodaxe, Knight, Arthos, Tomalong, and Metal something.
[377:38.91]Thanks for the subs.
[377:40.69]Five.
[377:44.99]I told you Streamlabs is fucked up.
[377:49.09]Hey, even if it was five, there's still five people that decided to give me five dollars today.
[377:53.15]So I will pay five dollars.
[377:56.63]Right?
[377:57.09]Even if it was five.
[378:01.59]That's still a lot of people.
[378:09.23]We have a few more bits to do.
[378:10.92]Don't know why that happened, but Streamlabs is kind of messed up tonight for some reason.
[378:15.05]Roughly.
[378:15.36]Praise the mighty Jera.
[378:16.00]Ugh.
[378:25.76]um let's see no more heroes 2 tomorrow if I don't finish no more heroes 2 tomorrow and finish no more heroes 2 on Wednesday and then potentially after completing no more heroes 2 tiny toons adventures summer uh vacation and that stream and then Thursday Resident Evil 3 or if I need
[378:49.51]the game tomorrow.
[378:51.10]No More Heroes 2.
[378:52.30]Resident Evil 3 on Wednesday.
[378:53.98]Then Thursday is Tiny Toon Adventures.
[378:55.86]Here we go.
[378:58.06]Then Monday.
[378:58.74]I want Community Content Night on probably the middle of the week from the 11th to the 13th.
[379:05.64]Somewhere like that.
[379:07.40]Then... No, Community Content Night is going to be Thursday.
[379:12.41]Right, I remember this.
[379:12.95]So the 11th, 12th.
[379:15.87]Let's say July 30th.
[379:20.38]I don't think there's enough time for me to feed that out.
[379:21.81]Okay.
[379:22.31]Mark it.
[379:28.67]Done.
[379:28.79]That makes sense.
[379:32.31]Hey, yes, XD.
[379:33.45]Thanks for the $5, Jerma.
[379:34.51]Just wanted to say that there's nothing wrong with not wanting to play TF2.
[379:38.02]You've made content for it for years.
[379:40.14]I totally understand if you feel like you've had enough of it in the game.
[379:42.62]Don't let chat get to you.
[379:43.42]I'm sure they're all just joking.
[379:44.48]Keep up the good work.
[379:47.58]No, I... I still... I...
[379:52.10]It's not like I'll never play the game for the rest of my life.
[379:54.83]I don't know.
[379:56.73]I typically would, if they come up with something, if there's a new update, or if they said a new one, or something else to talk about, or do, or then I would probably try it.
[380:06.93]Grandma, just please say slash S. But I don't have any intention to play it.
[380:16.69]I spent a decade playing that game.
[380:19.63]And it was the best game I've probably ever played.
[380:22.69]But... You know, I don't... It's just not something I really want to do.
[380:27.78]Oh, no.
[380:30.04]You missed a frog coin.
[380:31.68]Nice.
[380:35.34]Hey, bingo, sunshine.
[380:36.34]Thanks for the $2.50.
[380:37.12]What are you fiddling with in the background?
[380:38.64]We can hear it.
[380:39.22]Uh, batteries.
[380:43.47]It's batteries.
[380:51.56]I always have batteries here for some reason.
[380:53.84]This is like seven hours ago now, guys.
[380:55.82]You're referencing something that happened like potentially almost a whole day ago, like eight hours ago.
[381:20.61]Nearly a year ago.
[381:22.69]And finally.
[381:26.59]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[381:28.24]For more No More Heroes 2.
[381:29.18]The blast as always.
[381:33.52]C4G, thanks for the 250.
[381:36.94]I miss animalated crossing.
[381:39.04]Please let me get an island tour, sir.
[381:41.92]Let me see the animals one more time.
[381:43.65]I miss the funny cow and Phoebe and the other one.
[381:45.81]The monkey.
[381:46.73]That one.
[381:54.80]They'll visit your game too!
[381:59.80]Moo means moo, thanks for $3!
[382:01.10]Jeremy, I found you mentioning the TF2 Cinco de Mayo stream.
[382:04.10]I was only able to rip the audio, unfortunately, okay?
[382:10.56]Hey guys.
[382:12.18]It's me, Jeremy995.
[382:13.48]I'm gonna play TF2 on Cinco de Mayo.
[382:17.39]Coffee to your chicken.
[382:35.18]Damn, when you show that to me, that's... I guess I did say it.
[382:40.51]Those are all things that I would have said.
[382:44.81]Eating incredibly close to the microphone, too.
[382:50.82]I must have had a setting wrong.
[382:52.58]It got my webcam like, I guess I'll have to fucking just lie and not do it.
[382:59.38]No, that's gone.
[382:59.74]That's gone.
[383:00.02]Nobody wanted that fucking thing.
[383:00.97]That was hideous.
[383:01.37]I hit it with a hammer and fucking recycled it.
[383:29.60]It was sentimental value there.
[383:30.86]Remember, you should build a sandcastle on stream.
[383:41.31]That sounds like a really fun idea.
[383:42.41]I live in Las Vegas.
[383:47.24]There's no such thing as a beach here.
[383:52.40]There's plenty of sand But not enough sand to make a sandcastle because it's not the right kind of wet sand How would I would I build a sandcastle in with sand but I'd have to wet the sand after I would have to drench Like five acres with water
[384:16.99]Bring water.
[384:18.54]Use water, dumbass.
[384:19.48]Just use water.
[384:20.86]Bring a water truck.
[384:22.08]Rent a water truck.
[384:23.80]Buy beach sand online.
[384:25.26]Use a garden hose.
[384:30.38]He's landlocked.
[384:31.42]Omega lul.
[384:37.14]Yeah, so it's like fucking 70% of every country on Earth.
[384:43.55]Oh, he's landlocked.
[384:45.25]Omega lul.
[384:49.08]Why is that so funny?
[384:50.36]Oh, my God.
[384:51.04]Alright, Goo Berry Juice, thanks for $3.
[384:52.46]Hey, BadAdviceGiver985.
[384:55.40]I got an update for you on my whole bird problem.
[384:58.82]And, well, my sprinklers broke and wouldn't turn off.
[385:01.70]They were on for, like, 20 minutes, and by the time I found out, my entire yard was ruined.
[385:06.20]Oh, my scarecrow was out there, too.
[385:08.32]He's fucking dead.
[385:09.96]More updates coming soon.
[385:12.59]What the hell are you doing back here?
[385:26.26]Why are you like the jokey infomercial person that has everything horrible happen to them in black and white when they're trying to put a birdhouse up or make soil in their yard?
[385:39.10]Hold on, he's dead?
[385:44.20]I know.
[385:46.96]Oh no.
[385:48.72]No.
[385:50.80]It can't be.
[385:57.88]Holy shit, he's dead.
[386:10.28]I don't even want to look at that anymore.
[386:11.52]That's... Dude's dead.
[386:18.04]Thanks for the free dolls.
[386:18.98]I'll wish you luck.
[386:22.51]Hey, Johnny, nice mountain.
[386:23.71]Thanks for the $3.
[386:24.33]A Legosi documentary coming out soon.
[386:26.65]Maybe check it out.
[386:27.67]He recently passed away, so they shot the film in honor of his memory.
[386:31.13]I don't even know if that's fake or not.
[386:36.86]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
[386:38.40]Get some sleep.
[386:40.28]Back with more No More Heroes 2 tomorrow.
[386:42.98]See you soon.
[386:43.58]Take care.
[386:46.50]And there's a Reddit link here.
[386:47.48]What's this Reddit link?
[386:49.59]City is an empty glass.
[386:51.46]Words to... I don't know what that is.
[386:52.78]Alright, goodnight, guys.
[386:54.81]Goodbye.
[387:23.19]you
