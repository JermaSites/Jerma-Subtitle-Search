[35:14.74]Laswell.
[35:15.68]General Shepard.
[35:16.62]Oh, General.
[35:17.12]Oh, I know that look.
[35:20.52]What's that guy?
[35:22.47]You would be the first to know, sir.
[35:23.81]Damn right I would.
[35:25.23]Talk to me.
[35:26.99]We have a hit on Gabrani's second-in-command.
[35:28.83]Ahsan Zayani.
[35:32.07]Ahsan Zayani.
[35:32.65]Prince Force Major.
[35:35.28]He's taken up the mantle for Iran.
[35:37.04]Supplying terrorists.
[35:38.94]Money, weapons, intel.
[35:40.65]Well, he's ambitious.
[35:41.95]He's dangerous, sir.
[35:43.13]He wants retaliation for the Gharani strike.
[35:46.01]He's planning something.
[35:47.31]Something big.
[35:47.91]We can't take him in Iran.
[35:53.69]He's not in Iran, sir.
[35:56.61]He's on the ground in Al-Masra.
[35:58.13]What the hell is he doing in Al-Masra?
[36:00.32]It's between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
[36:03.52]Well, let's get him.
[36:07.59]What time is it now?
[36:10.07]Of course.
[36:11.51]Now!
[36:12.17]What better time than now?
[36:14.59]Send Ghost.
[36:16.35]The guy with the skull face.
[36:19.32]Wheels up in five.
[36:20.98]Roger.
[36:21.76]Marines are loading in now.
[36:23.36]You and the sergeant are leading the way on this.
[36:25.88]Sergeant.
[36:26.86]We've opened damage.
[36:28.18]Let's get ourselves a wing, yeah, LT?
[36:31.12]Save your seat, sir.
[36:32.20]Save your seat, sir.
[36:33.68]Does this guy ever do these?
[36:36.72]Does this guy ever take off his mask?
[36:39.28]Negative, sir.
[36:40.48]Out of here.
[36:42.38]Airstrikes are hitting enemy positions bordering Al-Masra.
[36:45.57]Intel confirms a concentration of AQ fighters converging in the valley.
[36:49.69]We believe they're protecting something.
[36:51.75]Surveillance indicates soldiers guarding three structures.
[36:54.69]Major Hassan may be holed up inside.
[36:57.37]Ghost and Soap will lead a Marine Special Operations Unit to kill or capture Hassan tonight.
[37:02.61]One Hilo will insert two teams at separate offset points bordering the target area.
[37:07.01]Bravo team will sweep and clear buildings one and two.
[37:10.15]Alpha team takes building three.
[37:12.29]All shooters have execute authority, but we want Hassan alive for interrogation.
[37:18.27]Be advised, Major Hassan is AQ's lifeline.
[37:22.43]If he is there, they will die for him.
[37:26.39]Sounds like pretty good surround soldiers.
[37:28.65]Keep up, Sok.
[38:07.23]I like running, but walking.
[38:11.62]I like to look like I'm running, but I walk.
[38:13.70]Nervous.
[38:24.45]Oh boy, Black Hawk down.
[38:25.77]Black Hawk down.
[38:34.26]Oh, this is a real Michael Bay situation.
[38:36.40]Alright, where are we going?
[38:42.38]What are we saying?
[38:43.58]What's the deal?
[38:50.07]Alpha, we're moving to building one.
[38:51.71]Hold tight.
[38:52.49]Ghost, we need to secure that crash site.
[38:55.07]No.
[38:55.97]First we clear for the sun.
[38:57.40]That takes the heat off Alpha.
[38:59.34]Then we secure the crash site.
[39:01.48]Clear?
[39:02.46]Roger that.
[39:03.18]Roger that.

[41:09.16]Second structure.
[41:11.84]Mm-hmm.
[41:13.24]Yeah.
[41:18.88]OK.
[41:19.34]Oh, sorry.

[42:06.83]Oops.
[42:07.97]Ghost, we're secure.
[42:09.69]Negative on her side.
[42:11.21]Roger.
[42:12.49]Kill the woman.
[42:13.61]Isn't the rule, no women, no children?
[42:18.15]I just broke it.
[42:19.31]It was an accident.
[42:22.19]I didn't mean to kill her.
[42:24.97]Casualty of war.
[42:27.29]You good, mate?
[42:28.25]I'm good.
[42:28.63]Yeah, please stop it.
[42:29.76]I mean, the PTSD I'll suffer for the next 10 years killing an innocent woman.
[42:33.20]I mean, I should be okay.
[42:35.94]All Bravo, circle up outside.
[42:38.87]Ghost, Soap, AQ's working with some good gear.
[42:43.39]Soap, we're moving to the crash site to help the wounded.
[42:46.37]The rest of you, hold here and cover us.
[42:48.78]Roger.

[61:24.74]What's going on?
[61:27.01]What's that?
[61:29.35]The hacker is ahead of you.
[61:30.77]I don't understand what that means.
[61:35.87]What's going on back here?
[61:36.91]Why is that happening?
[61:40.53]Can you put it back to the snow?
[61:41.97]I want people to think I'm in an actual place with snow.
[61:44.44]Oh no, we're in hell.
[61:47.98]Hold on.
[61:48.32]Hey, hey, hey!
[61:50.30]You too.
[61:52.58]What's going on with my backdrop?
[61:55.02]Um, we're trying to figure it out.
[61:56.60]The backdrop is supposed to be snow, and there's like meme shit on it.
[61:58.52]You're gonna try something.
[61:59.98]You're gonna try something?
[62:04.84]It's usually weird.
[62:05.86]Well, whatever it is, it didn't work.
[62:08.29]You know what?
[62:09.33]Why don't we mess with him back?
[62:11.35]Why don't we send something that's really gonna mess this stuff up?
[62:13.07]Hello.
[62:14.57]Hey, hey, stop talking.
[62:15.89]Nobody talk.
[62:17.21]Who the fuck are you?
[62:18.21]Who am I?
[62:18.71]Who are you?
[62:19.67]What are you doing on my stream?
[62:21.64]What do you mean your, what do you mean my springboard?
[62:23.24]This is my Christmas special.
[62:24.62]What are you doing here?
[62:25.52]Is this the guy?
[62:26.62]Is this the fucking guy right here?
[62:29.34]Hey bro, what's up?
[62:30.76]Hey bro.
[62:32.54]What, so this, did you just hack it?
[62:35.18]Yo, he's a hacker.
[62:36.48]Wow, he's so skilled.
[62:37.93]My name's the extinguisher.
[62:39.31]He's so talented.
[62:39.89]It's the extinguisher.
[62:42.33]Wait, what?
[62:43.13]You will call me by my name, the extinguisher.
[62:47.83]Your name is the extinguisher?
[62:49.51]That's right.
[62:51.16]Did you get that name in like the fifth grade?
[62:52.80]That sounds like a terrible name.
[62:54.28]It was sixth grade.
[62:56.48]The extinguisher.
[62:57.76]Okay, extinguisher.
[62:59.48]How are you?
[63:00.32]How are things?
[63:01.69]Why?
[63:02.31]What are you doing?
[63:03.25]What is your goal here?
[63:04.91]Oh, my goal?
[63:06.61]My goal is to get you to apologize for all the things you haven't accomplished, Jerma.
[63:11.19]I've accomplished tons of stuff.
[63:12.21]We got dollhouse.
[63:12.89]We got the... What about the hundred gifted subs?
[63:17.37]100 gifted subs.
[63:18.21]Yeah.
[63:19.53]What do you mean?
[63:20.37]What happened about you not playing Yakuza?
[63:23.87]I thought you were going to play that one.
[63:25.47]Yeah, I'm going to.
[63:26.93]I didn't play Yakuza.
[63:28.23]That's why you hacked the stream.
[63:29.57]And $2 billion of debt.
[63:31.46]What are you, the government?
[63:33.66]That's alright.
[63:34.34]Well, first of all, there's a couple things.
[63:35.74]Let me rebuttal.
[63:36.72]And after I rebuttal, maybe you'll give the channel back.
[63:39.02]Well, maybe when you play Glover, I'll give the channel back.
[63:43.14]I played Glover.
[63:44.02]That game sucked.
[63:45.40]What do you mean, play Glover?
[63:46.44]Is that what you're really on about here?
[63:47.34]That game rules.
[63:48.47]And the chat loves it.
[63:49.69]Alright.
[63:50.01]Well, I kind of don't give a shit about anything that you're saying right now because, number one, I did try to give the community subs 100.
[63:56.41]My credit card got declined like five times.
[63:58.99]I did try.
[63:59.63]My credit card got declined like five times.
[64:02.05]That's literally what you sound like.
[64:03.78]Did you get his fucking area yet?
[64:07.30]You're never going to find me, Jerma.
[64:10.24]So what the hell?
[64:11.68]You're just coming to taunt us?
[64:12.74]Is that what you're doing?
[64:13.30]Is that the fun you're going to have here?
[64:15.83]Yeah, that's why I'm here.
[64:16.91]I'm here to taunt you.
[64:18.13]And I'm here to give the people what they want.
[64:21.67]Yeah.
[64:22.59]And what is that again?
[64:23.63]You're just hacking the channel?
[64:24.69]That's funny.
[64:25.69]That's funny.
[64:26.27]Everyone's laughing about it.
[64:27.44]They love it.
[64:27.80]I'm sure it's fun.
[64:28.54]Look at them.
[64:29.18]Look at them in the chat.
[64:30.72]Okay, well, thank you.
[64:31.54]I appreciate hearing from you.
[64:32.78]Now, can you please leave me alone?
[64:33.70]I have shit I have to do.
[64:35.16]Leave me the fuck alone.
[64:35.92]Wow.
[64:37.08]No?
[64:37.38]Yeah, great response.
[64:40.97]No.
[64:41.09]That's the answer?
[64:43.25]No.
[64:44.07]Okay.
[64:44.73]Well, you know what?
[64:46.06]What do you got?
[64:46.70]What do you got?
[64:47.56]Why don't we send him something fucked up?
[64:50.30]How does that sound?
[64:50.88]Do you guys have a connection?
[64:52.40]Do you have a connection?
[64:53.19]What if I do this?
[64:54.37]Wait, wait, wait.
[64:54.71]What do you mean?
[64:55.19]What if I do this?
[64:56.47]Huh?
[64:57.79]Try this?
[64:58.13]Stop doing that.
[64:58.97]Ah.
[64:59.79]That's funny.
[65:00.11]Not so fun, is it?
[65:00.95]I saw the IP address.
[65:02.44]Yeah.
[65:02.70]Is that an IP?
[65:04.46]Yeah.
[65:04.96]Try that on for size.
[65:07.87]Get that shit off.
[65:08.67]Look at your face.
[65:09.99]It's so angry.
[65:11.13]You're such an asshole.
[65:13.31]You have a connection, right?
[65:14.17]Send something back.
[65:15.05]Good.
[65:15.45]Send something back, guy.
[65:17.55]Eat shit, you hacker!
[65:19.55]It's the extinguisher.
[65:21.13]You will learn my name by the end of this stream.
[65:23.85]You're just going to... Hello, old chum.

[65:28.55]You fucking... I'm Gnotto Gnoblin.

[65:35.69]What?
[65:35.79]I want to tell you what year it is.
[65:38.42]You're gonna gnome the guy?
[65:39.60]Did you just gnome me?
[65:40.43]That's so fucking stupid.
[65:41.85]Did you just gnome me on a live stream with over 20,000 people?
[65:46.49]That's so 2017.
[65:48.39]I don't... I can't... Why would you gnome somebody?
[65:53.64]That's all you can do back?
[65:56.30]Get his location and send something else.
[66:00.36]Get us back access for the love of God.
[66:04.62]Give me a fucking break, dude.
[66:06.54]Never gonna get it.

[71:00.41]So he was here.
[71:01.51]Lost him when we secured the crash site.
[71:04.73]Are you saying we shouldn't have helped?
[71:06.42]Choices have consequences.
[71:08.67]Did you really need to shower?
[71:13.87]Reapply that makeup, it's creepy.
[71:15.51]This isn't a factory of some kind, is it?

[71:36.40]Okay, let's see.
[71:41.66]What do you guys think of this run?

[71:50.46]What is, that's not, what is that?
[71:54.90]Look at this run.
[71:55.64]Oh.

[72:34.17]Yeah.
[72:34.31]Got your ass there.
[72:51.85]See how that works.
[72:53.51]That was a good one.
[73:00.19]Yes, I'm going to slowly run up this.
[73:02.46]Well, let's add it to Google Maps, shall we?
[73:22.42]Alright.
[73:26.00]Check the container.
[73:26.86]Here we go.
[73:30.52]Let's see.
[73:31.12]What the fuck is this?
[73:34.13]It's all in English.
[73:35.93]You know what?
[73:37.67]Yeah, at least.
[73:38.69]The extinguisher's gotta pee.
[79:05.86]Sorry, that took me a little longer than normal.
[79:07.74]My toilet's not working.
[79:09.00]I had to use my mother's bathroom upstairs.
[79:12.44]Alright.
[79:15.62]I hope you didn't miss me too much.
[79:17.13]Alright.
[79:17.33]Uh-oh.
[79:35.47]Uh-oh.
[79:35.81]America sold weapons to a terrorist.
[79:39.49]They never do that.
[79:40.11]They never do that.
[79:42.63]Everyone except you, lady.
[80:02.84]She knows.
[80:03.52]She knows this.
[80:05.43]Who sold the weapons to Hassan?
[80:08.89]Iran is in possession of American missiles.
[80:12.46]American missiles in AQ's hands.
[80:14.70]Hassan has been passing out our ballistic missiles like it's fucking Halloween.
[80:20.07]Oh, come on, you can't be surprised about this, General.
[80:22.11]He's having plausible deniability.
[80:23.75]Oh, deniability, my ass.
[80:25.49]Iran's all over this.
[80:27.07]I want to know how many they have and where they intend to use them.
[80:31.13]If Hassan is moving missiles, he has a smuggling partner.
[80:34.04]Well, then I would advise you to find out who that is.
[80:38.70]Give my team two hours with those missiles, sir.
[80:41.43]I will know everybody who's ever breathed on them.
[80:43.59]Negative.
[80:44.21]I want them destroyed.
[80:46.31]General, there's valuable intel there.
[80:49.11]This is an intelligence failure, Laswell.
[80:52.24]It's not gonna be a tactical one.
[80:54.26]There will be 500 enemy soldiers on that site by sunrise.
[80:58.86]We need a win fast.
[81:02.99]Bad move, General.
[81:05.49]Move your team and call for fire.
[81:07.35]I want those weapons destroyed.
[81:11.24]What the hell's Amsterdam got to do with this?
[81:19.07]Amsterdam's a smuggling hub?
[81:22.69]Since when?
[81:23.81]I know there's a lot of bikes in Amsterdam, but a smuggling hub?
[81:31.94]That's the first good news I've heard all day.
[81:36.59]I'll link up with him and handle this myself, sir.
[81:39.21]Kate Laswell back in the field?
[81:41.37]Oh.
[81:42.07]I want this done right.
[81:43.51]Oh.
[81:43.95]No mistakes.
[81:45.25]Is she going to paint her face and put a skull over her?
[81:47.52]Kate, I want Hassan boxed up and gift wrapped.
[81:53.38]Until then, you keep this tight.
[81:57.54]The way they talk about human life in this game is, it's like a Christmas present.
[82:04.69]Unreal.
[82:07.40]Amsterdam.
[82:07.92]Smuggling hub.
[82:08.44]Let's go to a cafe.
[82:08.90]The water is freezing.
[82:39.79]I'm pretty familiar with boating vessels.
[82:49.53]I'm not sure how or what they hooked up onto there.

[83:50.92]Where's the cab?
[83:54.44]Where'd he go?
[84:14.03]For a swim and a steel-cold knife to your neck.
[84:18.61]Alright, probably have to kill another guy before I get up on here.
[84:26.33]On topside.
[84:27.43]Don't stay up there for long.
[84:30.22]I've got a patrol boat in the house.
[84:41.34]I tell you, this would be a great spot to catch some bass.
[84:47.79]Largemouth, smallmouth, maybe some crappie.
[84:53.03]Great structure here for some big fish.
[85:14.36]Let's kill that guy.

[85:34.31]Ooh, yeah.
[85:37.26]That was pretty cool.
[85:41.30]Can I swim as fast as a boat?
[85:43.10]Apparently.

[86:17.55]I was hitting the button.

[111:35.15]Invite him to the party here.
[111:38.19]Well, you leaked the stream.
[111:40.69]It was one of you two.
[111:42.33]I sent you a DM.
[111:42.89]You know I wouldn't do that to you.
[111:45.23]I don't know who leaked it.
[111:46.09]Well, you are the one who was supposed to give it to production.
[111:47.99]Let me tell you right now, don't ever ask me for a stream key in a DM.
[111:50.87]Like, that's actually stupid, and I don't know why I listen to it.
[111:53.87]Well, that's true.
[111:54.65]It goes two ways.
[111:57.93]No, we love it.
[111:59.11]We love you.
[112:00.37]Okay, good news, he's in our lobby.
[112:05.10]Good news.
[112:05.60]Good news!
[112:06.28]Good news, everyone.
[112:07.34]You can win this, Jerma!
[112:09.26]I am still just thinking about how much I want to strangle you.
[112:11.60]Right.
[112:12.87]Well, okay.
[112:15.29]Can the other people in the room hear me?
[112:17.17]We're trying to get a private match.
[112:18.41]We can hear you.
[112:20.09]Create a private match.
[112:21.15]Can they answer this one question?
[112:23.79]He wants to ask you guys a question.
[112:26.01]Is his face as red as his hair right now?
[112:28.65]What's a good one?
[112:29.23]Do you want knockout?
[112:30.13]We want to go free-for-all.
[112:32.25]Free-for-all.
[112:33.16]Free-for-all.
[112:35.12]Five kills.
[112:36.64]Finally.
[112:37.08]I mean, the hacker, seriously, you thought you could set this whole thing up.
[112:40.26]Locked.
[112:41.00]You good to go?
[112:41.74]You've got a whole team of people.
[112:44.03]Yeah.
[112:44.77]Where's your, by the way, where are all your team of friends?
[112:47.39]I live.
[112:48.03]Yeah, right?
[112:48.63]Now we're a friendship.
[112:49.41]Now we're Christmas.
[112:50.01]Right here.
[112:51.67]Oh, we going?
[112:52.47]Let's go.
[112:53.45]Okay, alright, alright.
[112:54.32]Focus up, focus up, focus up, focus up.
[112:55.62]Come on, baby.
[112:57.95]You keep spilling.
[112:58.81]Are you ready?
[112:59.19]Well, you keep aiming wrong.
[113:00.37]Okay.
[113:00.75]Is this a good loadout?
[113:01.63]No, no, no.
[113:01.99]Custom loadout, too.
[113:02.66]Try it.
[113:03.68]Yeah, submachine gun.
[113:05.00]It's run and gun.
[113:05.78]Run and gun.
[113:06.30]Okay.
[113:06.52]Keep moving it.
[113:07.80]Keep on your toes.
[113:08.44]So should I try to aim at the head or headshots or what?
[113:10.42]You're not wearing a headset?
[113:11.70]Headshots or what?
[113:12.96]Headshots or what?
[113:13.64]Just hit him in the body.
[113:14.84]It doesn't matter.
[113:15.40]Just shoot him.
[113:16.06]Alright.
[113:16.62]Hey, yeah, let's go.
[113:17.56]Punk.
[113:17.94]Okay.
[113:18.68]Alright.
[113:26.35]We need the channel back.
[113:27.05]We need the channel back.
[113:27.72]Tighten up.
[113:28.96]Tighten up.
[113:30.30]We got PepsiCo on the phone.
[113:32.26]We got everybody screaming at us.
[113:33.26]There we go.
[113:33.68]That's one, Jerma.
[113:34.61]Okay.
[113:35.51]Yeah, I can count.
[113:36.17]Aiming a little low.
[113:36.87]Aiming a little low.
[113:38.55]Come now.
[113:39.59]Where are you?
[113:40.63]You've got energy on him.
[113:42.07]Come on.
[113:43.33]Are you camping?
[113:43.97]It's lame to camp.
[113:45.01]He can hear you.
[113:45.79]Why are you camping?
[113:46.75]Because I need my fucking channel.
[113:49.13]It's just lame.
[113:50.81]Are you laying down?
[113:53.77]And now he can hear us, and you fucked it up.
[113:56.11]Oh, I see you, Gemma.
[113:58.80]I see you.
[114:00.84]I saw your cute little butt.
[114:02.10]Oh!
[114:02.18]Let's go!
[114:10.07]He's made things interesting.
[114:12.51]He's made things interesting.
[114:15.17]Iron begets steel, baby.
[114:16.61]I've always said that.
[114:18.30]Your butt was nice in those pants.
[114:21.54]Is this a bad idea?
[114:25.22]You're lying down in the middle of the same spot.
[114:27.66]There's a lot of openings.
[114:28.86]There's a lot of openings.
[114:30.96]Reduce the amount of entries he could see.
[114:33.00]This might fuck him up.
[114:38.67]Wow!
[114:39.65]Excuse me?
[114:40.73]Wow.
[114:42.11]Thank you so much.
[114:42.99]Wow.
[114:44.19]Are you going to lay down the whole time?
[114:46.57]I'm not going to lay down the whole time.
[114:47.75]I mean, let's get, let's go ahead and say, where the heck?
[114:49.61]Pound it right there.
[114:50.39]You're not going to lay down again.
[114:52.21]No, not anymore.
[114:53.11]Running guns.
[114:53.57]Running guns.
[114:54.15]Headshot.
[114:54.67]Headshot.
[114:56.71]Right in the butt.
[114:59.21]Walk around a corner.
[114:59.83]Walk around.
[115:00.47]Go around a corner?
[115:01.91]Look at you.
[115:02.71]Look at you.
[115:04.01]But I don't know where the hell he is.
[115:05.17]How am I supposed to know that?
[115:05.83]So you have to go around a corner safely.
[115:07.82]Ludwig, I don't think you understand that this guy's on my channel right now.
[115:11.26]What is that?
[115:12.00]You don't understand.
[115:12.58]If you fucking lose this game, you don't get your channel back.
[115:15.76]Yes, the channel.
[115:16.63]I'm thinking of calling the channel The Extinguisher.
[115:21.53]Twitch is not going to let you change my name to The Extinguisher.
[115:25.15]I'm going to change it to The Extinguisher 986.
[115:28.61]He's actually pulling a lot of numbers.
[115:30.12]I've actually seen his viewership.
[115:31.38]It went up since you were on.
[115:32.62]How many viewers does he have on that channel?
[115:35.08]400 million.
[115:36.66]There are 50,000.
[115:37.00]How many people are actually on that channel?
[115:38.82]He's like a 30 40k.
[115:40.06]He's big.
[115:40.82]Like I actually I'm asking if you want to operate.
[115:48.19]Oh, that's it.
[115:50.33]That's it.
[115:51.03]It's the first of five.
[115:52.01]The first five you're hitting me a little hard.
[115:54.63]Uh huh.
[115:55.19]Wow.
[116:00.18]First to five kills?
[116:01.02]It's first to five, and we got two rounds, three rounds.
[116:03.18]Come on, tighten up then, tighten up.
[116:04.56]Two more kills.
[116:05.70]Two more.
[116:06.16]Two more kills.
[116:06.76]Maybe reload, maybe reload.
[116:08.00]What?
[116:09.08]Reload.
[116:09.80]Oh, I thought it automatically did that.
[116:11.64]No, you're still not reloaded.
[116:12.88]What are you talking about?
[116:14.16]I pressed R, it didn't make any sense.
[116:16.56]You run canceled it.
[116:17.54]You know what, you have no style.
[116:19.32]What are you doing?
[116:19.92]I'm stuck.
[116:20.24]You are shooting the bag, and you are, okay.
[116:26.76]Hey, hacker.
[116:27.52]Hey, extinguisher.
[116:28.68]Yeah.
[116:29.28]Hey, are you playing with a controller?
[116:38.80]He's playing with a controller.
[116:41.56]Let me just touch that.
[116:42.96]Yeah, he's got a controller.
[116:48.57]Yeah, not so funny now anymore, huh?
[116:52.91]And don't do this when you're talking to him.
[116:55.25]Do you want me to plug in your controller you've been talking about?
[116:57.92]No, no, no, we're good.
[116:59.16]First to five, you need to lead there.
[117:00.72]Three to three.
[117:08.22]This thing sucks.
[117:10.11]Are you dancing on top of that car?
[117:12.21]Everybody quiet in the room.
[117:13.39]Shit!
[117:13.63]I didn't want to press the button.
[117:32.87]Get away from the bus, Jerma.
[117:35.05]What?
[117:35.29]Don't go near the bus?
[117:36.26]Stay away from the bus.
[117:37.20]Dude, stop.
[117:37.58]I'm walking around the bus.
[117:39.58]Dude, the bus is, yeah, I should hide under the bus to be able to find when he walks by, right?
[117:44.12]No, it's a bad idea.
[117:45.46]Oh, you're doing it, though.
[117:46.52]You're doing it no matter what we say.
[117:47.90]It's alright, though.
[117:49.02]It doesn't matter.
[117:49.50]Man, if he came from behind the bus right now.
[117:53.61]And aimed only at the bus.
[117:54.85]He would kill you.
[118:04.94]You're adorable.
[118:06.00]Oh, that went down my entire body.
[118:08.32]I need one more kill and that's it.
[118:10.16]One more, one more, for the channel.
[118:11.26]One more, one more.
[118:12.32]Come on, this is for the channel.
[118:14.36]Come on, baby.
[118:14.80]Are you nervous?
[118:16.44]Are you nervous?
[118:17.76]Tighten up.
[118:18.46]Oh, the extinguisher's coming for me?
[118:19.74]Is that what you're saying?
[118:20.58]The extinguisher is, oh.
[118:22.21]Oh.
[118:23.27]Oh.
[118:24.35]Oh.
[118:26.09]Oh.
[118:27.25]Oh.
[118:27.37]Oh.
[118:27.63]Oh.
[118:27.93]Look at that.
[118:35.12]Look at that.
[118:36.14]That's your channel.
[118:38.08]That's your channel.
[118:39.68]It's best of three.
[118:40.66]It's not over yet.
[118:41.29]Best of three.
[118:41.85]It's actually my channel now, isn't it?
[118:44.53]Oh, yeah, best of three.
[118:46.19]Yeah, you want two more chances?
[118:48.07]No, it's best of three.
[118:49.17]You said best of three.
[118:50.21]I did say best of three.
[118:51.19]I'll give you best of three.
[118:52.65]You said best out of three.
[118:53.95]I did.
[118:54.79]I did.
[118:56.09]Are you nervous?
[118:57.65]Look at your friends.
[118:58.41]Your friends are all...
[119:00.27]Hands on faces.
[119:03.05]They don't look like the beach boys anymore.
[119:04.87]They look like the beach bums.
[119:08.76]Look at them.
[119:09.76]I don't know what to do.
[119:10.60]Go, go, go, go.
[119:11.48]I'm ready.
[119:11.78]I'm ready.
[119:12.30]I don't know what to do.
[119:13.20]Go, go.
[119:15.92]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[119:18.12]Back in, back in.
[119:19.06]Hey, we're back in.
[119:19.74]Back in.
[119:20.10]You can do this.
[119:20.92]I cannot hear anything you guys are saying, by the way.
[119:22.66]These are noise-canceling headphones.
[119:26.00]Look at him praying behind you.
[119:27.52]They're worried.
[119:28.67]I know, I know.
[119:30.71]They're worried.
[119:31.55]Is this a good loadout?
[119:32.81]Yeah, good, good.
[119:34.23]Good?
[119:34.33]You think this is good?
[119:35.97]Okay.
[119:36.39]Keep it up.
[119:37.39]Do you think that... We'll take a deal.
[119:39.83]Do a deal?
[119:40.13]We could hit him up.
[119:41.66]Yeah, there's like a... I think we could sign him.
[119:47.41]Is he charming or funny?
[119:49.51]I'm walking this way.
[119:50.15]What I like about him is he seems like he'll stand by what he promises.
[119:56.58]And I think that's what a sponsor wants.
[120:01.00]You got it, baby!
[120:02.32]What's up?
[120:02.68]You got it!
[120:05.57]What was that?
[120:05.99]I thought you gave him the finger.
[120:08.81]Hey, extinguisher, deal with this one, bud.
[120:12.87]Extinguisher, that's cool.
[120:14.91]Flashing into it.
[120:17.02]Well, I like that you're calling me extinguisher.
[120:19.76]Well, I don't know your name.
[120:20.82]It's the only thing you said.
[120:21.78]You know my name.
[120:24.14]You drained my bank account, too?
[120:25.56]Wait, what was the other one?
[120:26.68]Although I've heard you're two billion in debt.
[120:32.79]That's fucking bullshit.
[120:33.63]Yeah.
[120:34.33]Yeah.
[120:41.01]By the way, I can hear every single thing you guys have said.
[120:47.70]Let's go, Jerma!
[120:48.26]Let's go, Big J!
[120:49.10]Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma,
[121:14.22]Your cheeks are... Yeah, you are a fucking cock player, aren't you?
[121:17.26]They're clapping.
[121:18.56]Press Q. Q?
[121:20.02]Cheeks be clapping.
[121:20.86]What's that?
[121:22.50]What the hell?
[121:23.52]What was that?
[121:24.12]Ludwig, what the hell was that?
[121:25.26]Try E. Try E. E?
[121:26.00]Yeah, I think you have to... Is this a grenade?
[121:33.26]I think so.
[121:34.39]You have to release it there.
[121:36.08]You think so?
[121:37.34]I don't know.
[121:37.92]It just was on.
[121:39.50]Use your eyes.
[121:40.21]I just saw the bottom right.
[121:41.19]He's holding a grenade.
[121:42.33]But the icon doesn't look like a grenade.
[121:43.75]It could be like a Molotov.
[121:45.13]Yeah.
[121:45.35]It's just.
[121:46.33]Shh.
[121:46.47]I hear him.
[121:51.45]Fuck it.
[121:55.13]Come into the room in the back near the car.
[121:57.52]Hey, extinguisher.
[121:58.52]If you come into the room with a guy with a point and a gun at the camera.
[122:06.44]I need to get one kill.
[122:10.93]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[122:12.19]You're not doing well.
[122:12.73]Come on.
[122:13.33]Come on, baby.
[122:14.63]Are your palms sweaty?
[122:16.77]No, they're actually very dry.
[122:18.09]Thanks for asking, though.
[122:19.65]Your lips?
[122:20.01]I can help.
[122:21.13]Yeah, thank you.
[122:23.61]Is it because you smudged the war paint, do you think?
[122:28.17]Could I?
[122:28.49]Gemma.
[122:29.49]Get this, put it over there.
[122:32.17]Your butt's bloody.
[122:43.66]Stop touching me so I can focus.
[122:48.60]I am fun!
[122:49.36]I am fun!
[122:49.74]This is fun!
[122:50.40]Oh, Jerma.
[122:50.96]Oh, Jerma.
[122:51.42]Jerma.
[122:51.66]Jerma.
[122:51.82]Oh.
[122:51.94]Oh.
[122:52.04]Oh.
[123:10.64]Reasonable.
[123:11.18]I want everybody else's back.
[123:13.11]Welcome to my channel.
[123:16.17]The Extinguisher 986.
[123:19.41]Go to break.
[123:19.87]Just go to the else.
[123:20.85]Go to the else.
[123:21.89]Go to the else.
[123:22.57]Go to the else.
[123:24.43]Extinguisher.
[123:25.92]Look at the chat.
[123:26.76]They're going crazy.
[123:28.08]Sweep.
[123:29.74]Extinguisher.
[123:31.04]Yeah.
[123:43.64]Gotta love playing PC players on a controller.
[123:49.88]And I won.
[123:51.70]You see?
[123:52.72]Not so bad after all.
[123:55.06]Gets a bad rap, the controller.
[123:58.51]Really, so much easier.
[124:01.09]A lot less carpal tunnel.
[124:05.35]Can I get one more of those?
[124:06.01]Yeah.
[124:09.57]Alright.
[124:10.23]Grab me one more of those.
[124:11.07]That feels good.
[124:12.11]I feel good.
[124:13.99]I feel real good.
[124:15.09]Out of the shot.
[124:15.95]Oh, another shot.
[124:16.79]5-0.
[124:17.03]Look at the chat.
[124:18.75]Thank you so much.
[124:19.33]I was like.
[124:19.77]Yes.
[124:22.91]I'm good for now.
[124:24.09]Yes.
[124:25.23]Extinguisher.
[124:29.17]I would love to see his face right now.
[124:33.48]Do they have enough keyboards for him to break, I wonder?
[124:37.65]You don't have to have a mic or anything.
[124:41.61]Do they have enough keyboards for him to break?
[124:46.07]What do you think, chat?
[124:47.29]Are there enough keyboards on the planet for Jerma to break?
[124:53.18]Oh, shit.
[124:53.94]Get back to work.
[124:57.56]Right now.
[124:59.66]There's no progress in this room.
[125:01.58]Wait, wait, wait.
[125:03.23]Look at him.
[125:05.15]What is this?
[125:05.61]The puzzle.
[125:09.04]Do that one.
[125:11.52]That was more.
[125:13.32]Do this one.
[125:14.54]There's nothing even here.
[125:15.62]Goddamn.
[125:33.41]Look at this.
[125:37.51]Look at Jerma.
[125:38.75]They're all drunk.
[125:40.23]They're all drunk.
[125:40.89]Shooting him in the face.
[125:42.03]Wow, look at his face degrade.
[125:46.71]One sip each.
[125:53.74]Christmas is over.
[126:09.77]A little thermite on your nuts.
[126:13.49]God bless America.
[126:18.99]Land that I love.
[126:22.17]Let's see, what's this?
[126:24.93]Oh, more bullets.
[126:25.91]Great.
[126:31.22]They won't be able to recognize you.
[126:32.96]We're going to have to put you in the tomb of the unknown soldier.
[126:41.10]That felt good.
[126:42.80]Alright.
[126:44.86]You know what?
[126:45.26]The extinguisher is a little hungry after that victory.
[126:49.77]I'm gonna go get a snack.
[127:19.03]Engineers, engineers!
[127:22.21]Go to your spot.
[127:26.33]Go to your spot.
[127:29.09]Sorry, you guys are here for the blueberry stuff?
[127:31.08]Yeah, kind of.
[127:31.72]Has the blueberry started yet?
[127:33.82]I don't think so.
[127:35.40]The chicken has been delivered there, probably.
[131:21.64]What are you going to do?
[131:25.88]Okay.
[131:26.00]Alright.
[131:28.52]Don't do anything too weird, though.
[131:31.83]Oh, my God.
[131:33.67]Don't do anything too weird.
[131:38.51]You alright?
[131:45.29]What the fuck are you doing?
[131:48.57]That's connected to the toilet.
[131:49.63]That's not even connected.
[131:50.43]That's not connected to anything.
[131:51.99]Oh, God.
[131:56.91]What?
[131:59.93]What?
[132:00.31]Okay.
[132:00.71]Alright.
[132:00.99]Alright.
[132:01.27]I'll hold on to something.
[132:01.89]Alright.
[132:02.21]I'm holding on.
[132:04.98]Whoa.
[132:05.34]What is that?
[132:06.68]What is going on?
[132:12.56]What the fuck?
[132:21.85]Jesus.
[132:32.60]No.
[132:37.97]I'm nothing.
[132:39.33]I don't want to do anything.
[132:42.07]Bugleberry, you could do something else, maybe?
[132:44.01]Do something else.
[132:45.87]Something else.
[132:47.71]Do something else.
[132:48.55]I don't want to do that.
[132:56.61]Dude, I don't... Something's weird.
[133:01.73]No!
[133:02.62]No.
[133:02.80]We'll sacrifice... Something else, something else.
[133:04.98]Maybe... Does a crew member... Does a crew member have something that we can put in?
[133:09.24]Maybe like a... Wow.
[133:17.23]No.
[133:19.05]No, no, no, no.
[133:19.91]Don't let it... Don't touch those presents.
[133:22.95]Don't touch those presents.
[133:23.97]Those are my presents.
[133:26.26]Do not touch them.
[133:27.96]No, get out of here.
[133:29.12]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[133:30.94]Please, please, at least leave a couple.
[133:33.34]I'm taking this one.
[133:33.93]This is my present.
[133:35.47]These are my presents.
[133:37.59]Bugleberry, come on.
[133:38.47]There's got to be something else you can do besides this.
[133:42.13]Don't listen to him.
[133:43.77]Dude, wait, is he still there?
[133:47.81]Bugleberry, wait, stop.
[133:50.12]Stop.
[133:51.08]Can you hear me?
[133:53.42]What the fuck, dude?
[133:55.10]Those are mine.
[133:57.50]I don't even know what's in those.
[134:01.16]Pump me into him.
[134:01.84]Is he still there?
[134:03.81]Something's not right.
[134:04.31]Bugleberry, can you hear me?
[134:05.91]Can I leave?
[134:06.57]Don't touch.
[134:07.15]Leave a couple, please.
[134:07.81]Something's not right.
[134:09.59]Oh, my God.
[134:11.75]Chet's telling me to watch out.
[134:12.85]What's going on?
[134:13.95]I don't want to do this.
[134:14.73]I don't want to do this.
[134:15.57]It's Bugleberry.
[134:19.39]I don't want to do this.
[134:21.81]Anything else, please!
[134:23.13]Anything else!
[134:24.77]Anything else!
[134:36.58]Is it an iPhone?
[134:38.34]Jesus!
[134:48.53]Xbox!
[134:49.63]The chat seems to be warning me.
[134:50.65]That's my Xbox!
[134:52.02]They're telling me to run.
[134:53.36]Bugabay, don't put that one in, maybe.
[134:54.64]That's an Xbox.
[134:57.94]Where am I?
[134:58.88]I can't run.
[134:59.46]Jesus.
[134:59.68]Where am I going to go?
[135:06.50]Oh, my God.
[135:07.26]I'm a medium.
[135:15.89]I'm a medium.
[135:16.95]I'm going in.
[135:17.57]I'm going in there.
[135:18.89]I'm going in.
[135:20.81]I'm going in.
[135:21.29]No.
[135:22.28]Let me in!
[135:26.04]Fucking come on.
[135:26.81]Get off of me!
[135:37.01]My tongue's gone dry.
[135:41.25]I don't... That game sucks.
[135:42.11]I don't care.
[135:42.55]Put that one in.
[135:44.76]Put that one in.
[135:45.26]I don't care.
[135:46.46]That's probably the only one I don't care about.
[135:51.44]What is it?
[135:53.53]What's in it?
[135:56.01]Don't put it in.
[135:57.39]Don't put that one in.
[135:58.11]Leave me one present, Bugleberry, please.
[136:00.25]One present.
[136:01.89]Thank you.
[136:02.93]Thank God I only get one.
[136:09.30]Jesus.
[136:13.78]I have no idea, I just feel sick.
[136:16.16]I don't know.
[136:18.65]What should I be feeling?
[136:21.21]What are you doing?
[136:25.99]Okay.
[136:27.03]Oh boy.
[136:32.61]Two points, yeah.
[136:33.53]Bugleberry, I feel fucking sick.
[136:38.30]What was it?
[136:42.08]Bugleberry, something's wrong.
[136:45.14]How do you feel?
[136:49.98]What the fuck was that?
[136:52.48]Bugleberry, stop!
[136:54.04]Stop, stop it right, please stop!
[137:00.18]I don't even know what's happening.
[137:05.10]My chest hurts.
[137:06.88]My chest hurts.
[137:08.52]Is it even doing anything?
[137:11.38]I don't think it's doing anything.
[137:16.77]I don't think it's working.
[137:21.25]I don't know.
[137:21.91]I don't think so.
[137:22.87]Maybe.
[137:23.25]I don't... Nothing's happening.
[137:27.85]What do you mean it's not?
[137:29.10]It's... I don't think it's happening!
[137:30.56]I didn't get the channel back, now did I?
[137:33.37]No.
[137:33.43]You know what?
[137:33.99]Fuck!
[137:34.27]You want power?
[137:35.05]You want magical history?
[137:37.51]I'll give it to you.
[137:39.01]No!
[137:39.21]Stop!
[137:39.45]They all have to go in now, sir!
[137:42.45]One of this, and I go, hello!
[137:48.93]Was this, I mean, what?
[137:54.25]What?
[137:56.09]Whatever it was!
[138:08.35]And by the way, if you invite somebody to a party and you tell them to do something, make sure it's what you actually say and not this bold crap.
[138:15.51]I don't want to swear, but I just didn't... Dude, easy on the language, please, but... Bugleberry!
[138:21.31]No, no, no.
[138:22.07]Are you okay?
[138:22.89]Oh, my God.
[138:25.63]No!
[138:27.09]Oh!
[138:28.15]Oh!
[138:30.50]Oh!
[138:36.64]What the fuck just happened?
[138:37.66]What happened?
[138:38.30]What happened?
[138:41.20]What's going on?
[138:42.86]Hey.
[138:43.06]Hey.
[138:45.51]You piece of shit.
[138:46.95]It's you.
[138:47.71]It's you.
[138:47.95]You motherfucker.
[138:49.57]I see you now.
[138:50.55]You mother blubber.
[138:51.35]I see you.
[138:52.41]I can see you.
[138:52.91]I see you.
[138:54.56]What do I do about this?
[138:55.76]What do I do?
[138:56.20]What happened?
[138:57.40]What do I do?
[138:57.80]What do I do?
[138:58.80]What do I do?
[138:59.62]Oh, now you're scared?
[139:00.76]That's where I had it.
[139:01.70]I had a magician.
[139:02.58]I have a guy.
[139:03.38]I know a guy.
[139:04.18]You know hacking.
[139:05.49]I got dark magic, motherfucker, and I come for you now.
[139:08.79]What did you do?
[139:09.47]What did you do?
[139:13.07]What is that?
[139:13.91]What is...
[139:15.47]What is that?
[139:16.53]I know we don't really know each other, and this is really strange, it's really weird, everything going on, but is your room cold right now?
[139:22.78]It's very cold.
[139:24.52]My nips are... Yeah.
[139:26.32]Do you see what is under here?
[139:31.02]Yes.
[139:32.22]I have something down here.
[139:33.75]I don't know what this is.
[139:34.55]It's a swirling thing.
[139:36.19]Do you have one of those in your room, dude?
[139:38.19]Yeah.
[139:39.41]Yes.
[139:40.27]Okay.
[139:41.77]I don't, um, I'll be really honest, this is kind of freaking me out.
[139:44.63]I know Bugleberry, hopefully Bugleberry's okay.
[139:47.52]Do we call someone?
[139:48.80]I don't know, man, hold on, let me, let me put my hand in here.
[139:52.10]Don't, don't, uh.
[139:53.70]Can you see?
[139:55.22]What the?
[139:56.30]Ow, don't, ow!
[139:57.62]Ow!
[139:57.86]God!
[139:58.10]Was that you?
[139:59.98]Was that you?
[140:00.40]Was that you?
[140:01.56]Was that you?
[140:05.21]I don't know.
[140:05.91]Did it feel like someone slapped your hand?
[140:07.77]It felt like somebody touched my finger, like in the middle of something, somebody slapped my hand.
[140:10.41]Was that, you touched me?
[140:12.17]That was, that was me.
[140:15.37]Man, you motherfucker!
[140:16.57]Come here!
[140:17.59]How does that feel, huh?
[140:19.67]Does that feel weird?
[140:20.93]Does that feel weird, does it?
[140:23.61]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
[140:25.17]Stop, stop, stop, stop!
[140:26.14]God damn it!
[140:28.86]You don't choke me!
[140:30.48]Alright, man, you wanna fuck around?
[140:32.46]How does this, is this?
[140:34.46]Don't, don't, don't you?
[140:35.94]I'm going to kick you in the goddamn face.
[140:37.56]How does that sound?
[140:40.22]Don't you?
[140:42.29]Ow, ow, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go.
[140:44.85]Ow, let go, let go, let go, let go.
[140:46.17]Put it back, put it back, put it back.
[140:50.83]What is wrong with you?
[140:53.17]Those were nice kids, by the way.
[140:54.69]Yeah, they are nice shoes.
[140:56.49]I'm glad you like them.
[140:57.53]You know what?
[140:59.85]Look at you.
[141:00.97]Mike, Mike.
[141:02.46]The camera's all twisted.
[141:03.62]How do you feel about this, you piece of shit?
[141:05.92]It's a piece of wood.
[141:06.98]Yeah, it's a piece of wood.
[141:08.12]It'll knock your fucking teeth out.
[141:09.18]What are you going to do with a piece of wood?
[141:11.06]I'm coming in there and I'm going to knock your head off.
[141:14.51]Hold it right there, boys.
[141:18.69]Santa!
[141:19.75]This has got to stop.
[141:21.61]This is not the Christmas spirit.
[141:25.39]What?
[141:26.97]Santa.
[141:27.57]What is this?
[141:28.97]You've got a, you've, there's a. Jerma, young man, get over here.
[141:33.74]What do you mean?
[141:34.70]There's a Santa here?
[141:35.56]I mean, that's kind of funny.
[141:38.60]There was nobody here before.
[141:42.12]Put that stick down.
[141:44.64]What?
[141:45.78]I remember the last time you used that stick.
[141:49.70]It's real.
[141:50.38]It's him.
[141:51.36]It's really him.
[141:52.10]That's the real Santa.
[141:52.88]That's the real Santa.
[141:53.80]Dude bro, this is the real Santa, I think.
[141:55.58]You cannot have any more of this.
[141:58.54]You are ruining Christmas with your dark magic and your foul mouth.
[142:04.73]I don't know what to say, but I mean, the magic was not me.
[142:10.13]I hired somebody to come and hang out.
[142:12.15]I don't know what to say.
[142:13.61]Well, my magicometer sensed it all the way from the North Pole that something was not right in this place, and I've come to set the Christmas spirit right again.
[142:23.16]Okay, okay.
[142:24.46]But that's going to require change on both of your parts.
[142:28.98]Okay.
[142:30.80]What do you mean?
[142:31.84]What do you want us to do?
[142:33.16]I want you to reconcile as brothers.
[142:36.34]I want an apology from both of you.
[142:39.07]And we're going to start with Extinguisher.
[142:42.31]With me, Santa?
[142:43.85]Yes, you get the chance to go first, to be nice, and to apologize to this little boy.
[142:50.01]I've never grown, man.
[142:51.98]Well, when you put it like that,
[142:56.08]I'm sorry, Jerma, for hacking your stream and playing the best game of Call of Duty that I've ever put on board.
[143:05.49]Yeah.
[143:07.57]My bad.
[143:08.92]Anything else?
[143:11.36]You're not.
[143:13.20]I really do like your butt cheeks.
[143:16.34]There's no place for that here, Extinguisher.
[143:18.80]Thank you.
[143:19.12]It was a compliment, Santa, but you're right.
[143:24.63]Well, I mean, Santa, he hacked my- Time to apologize.
[143:28.51]He hacked my channel and he tried to- Excuses.
[143:32.41]He wiped out my bank account and he hacked the channel and it ruined my Christmas show and it was really kind of annoying and- Selfishness.
[143:39.56]Doesn't sound like an apology.
[143:41.04]No, it's not.
[143:43.80]Extinguisher, I am sorry that I called you a dork.
[143:49.02]I said that your hacking abilities weren't very good.
[143:51.43]I mean, you seem like kind of a nice guy.
[143:54.01]And then you seem like pretty cool, so I'm sorry.
[143:58.31]Really?
[143:59.59]Yeah.
[144:00.94]Is that sincere, young man?
[144:03.48]Yeah, and that's, uh, I also maybe want to say sorry to the crew.
[144:06.54]I think I was a little mean earlier.
[144:08.98]I've just been under a lot of stress.
[144:11.66]And... Stress?
[144:12.84]Stress.
[144:14.18]And who else do you need to apologize to?
[144:17.32]Um...
[144:18.65]And maybe my mother, because she thought I was going to be a doctor and I ended up being a clown on the internet.
[144:23.22]But I mean, still doing pretty well.
[144:25.50]And sorry, Mom.
[144:26.70]I think that covers it.
[144:29.39]Anyone else, Jerma?
[144:35.13]Oh, right, the two by four.
[144:38.19]I'm sorry, Santa, for, I didn't know, how am I supposed to know?
[144:42.85]Excuses.
[144:44.19]But how am I supposed to know that it was you?
[144:46.09]I didn't mean to hit you with that, I'm sorry.
[144:49.32]Spit it out.
[144:50.16]I'm very sorry to everybody.
[144:52.18]Okay, well that's what I like to hear.
[144:55.28]And Santa likes when you make nice.
[144:58.36]Thank you, this is very big.
[145:00.26]You're welcome.
[145:02.00]That's a big candy cane.
[145:03.20]And now, now that we have reconciliation here, I can finally grant you your Christmas wishes.
[145:12.51]You've been so nice, Extinguisher.
[145:15.61]What would you like for Christmas?
[145:19.01]Dude, you got a Christmas wish, dude.
[145:20.55]What are you going to do?
[145:23.20]Oh, um, oh, I got it.
[145:26.47]Can you please, please make me silver in League of Legends?
[145:33.11]It's about time you got out of bronze.
[145:34.75]Yeah.
[145:37.27]Wow!
[145:38.89]Did you get it?
[145:40.05]There you go.
[145:40.75]Silver!
[145:42.36]Whoa!
[145:43.02]Thanks, Santa!
[145:44.58]You're welcome, little boy.
[145:46.16]It worked?
[145:46.94]You're actually silver?
[145:48.42]Yeah.
[145:49.02]Dude, that's sick.
[145:50.80]So sick.
[145:51.70]Wow.
[145:53.08]And now for you, Termo.
[145:55.22]Money.
[145:57.47]Greed.
[145:57.69]Avarice.
[145:58.03]Ten million, at least.
[145:59.78]Wow, damn, why didn't I try again?
[146:04.26]I wish for the things to kind of go back to normal, the way they were before Extinguisher came on and hacked.
[146:13.09]I'd like to do the rest of my awards and just chill and have a good time.
[146:17.41]The way things should have been, had you been nice.
[146:21.03]That's true.
[146:22.23]Ho, ho, ho!
[146:23.41]Santa can do that!
[146:27.11]Whoa.
[146:28.99]Did it work?
[146:30.21]How do you feel?
[146:30.89]I feel great.
[146:33.51]Do you?
[146:33.71]I feel jiggly inside.
[146:35.20]Dude, hey, how about this?
[146:37.38]I'll take you to lunch.
[146:39.10]What?
[146:40.28]I got at least 10 minutes on Friday if you want to hang out.
[146:43.64]I got 15 minutes on Friday.
[146:44.90]Wow.
[146:47.26]Yeah.
[146:48.05]I've got an hour on Friday.
[146:50.21]Minimum.
[146:51.03]Oh, that calls for a real sit-down restaurant.
[146:53.75]You like Ruby Tuesdays?
[146:55.11]Yeah, let's do it.
[146:57.48]Alright, you and me are going to go.
[147:00.34]It's good to see you playing nice together again.
[147:02.86]Thank you.
[147:04.30]Thank you.
[147:05.20]Thank you.
[147:05.74]Bye-bye.
[147:07.34]Santa, thank you so much.
[147:09.44]That was unbelievable.
[147:10.86]Bye, everyone.
[147:12.22]The power of Christmas.
[147:14.68]Yeah.
[147:15.14]And the right magic.
[147:16.30]Not that dark stuff.
[147:17.74]You can never go back to that again.
[147:19.50]Well, I think Buleberry might be dead, or he's gone.
[147:22.72]I have no idea where he is, but we might not see him for a long time.
[147:27.63]And remember, the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart.
[147:31.97]It's true.
[147:33.05]So keep changing that.
[147:35.19]And to all the community out there, I want to remind you that this is the season for giving and forgiving.
[147:44.56]And a Merry Christmas to all!
[147:48.69]Thank you, Santa, seriously.
[147:50.40]Hey, and Extinguisher, I'm serious, we should go hang out.
[147:55.28]I'm sorry, I didn't, it is the spirit for giving.
[147:58.14]It is the spirit for reconciliation and hanging out and having a good time.
[148:04.77]Holy fucking shit, what a disaster.
[148:08.35]What was that?
[148:09.41]I meant to say Merry Christmas to all, and to all have a very good evening, and to all good night, and Merry Christmas too.
[148:17.97]And to all a good night.
[148:23.62]Wow.
[148:30.30]Are we on the channel?
[148:31.38]Are we on my channel now?
[148:34.58]Are we good?
[148:38.76]I am so sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but sometimes it takes the spirit of Christmas.
[148:42.90]Sometimes it takes Santa Claus to come out and right the wrongs.
[148:48.58]Ladies and gentlemen, we are not done.
[148:51.12]We are now on the channel.
[148:52.96]We have control.
[148:54.66]We're, in fact, just getting started.
[148:56.88]So let's go into our next category.
[148:59.33]This is category number 11, by the way.
[149:02.71]There are a lot more to do.
[149:05.04]So this is best rant and there's some spillage here and I'm gonna need production to maybe help me eventually after this category, right?
[149:16.92]I'm not gonna say any bad words.
[149:19.08]I'm not gonna yell at anybody.
[149:21.18]Production, I spilled some cocoa earlier and I may need a little bit of help to clean it up.
[149:29.21]How's that sound?
[149:30.77]There we are.
[149:31.99]Alright, ladies and gentlemen, let's do this category.
[149:33.61]This is Best Rant of the Year.
[149:35.71]Here are your nominees.
[149:37.37]Thank you, Santa, for fixing everything.
[149:48.42]It's just, I get exhausted.
[149:49.98]I can't, my brain goes like, alright, man, that's enough.
[149:52.47]No humans are supposed to be doing this.
[149:55.14]You know what fucking humans are supposed to be doing?
[149:57.42]Humans are supposed to be fucking picking up like a wheelbarrow full of like logs and just like slowly walking with it and delivering those logs to the community.
[150:07.58]And then like those logs are used to build houses.
[150:09.87]And then there's also like a baker and like a butcher.
[150:12.37]No, humans aren't supposed to be doing what we're doing right now.
[150:15.77]Humans aren't supposed to be doing this.
[150:17.55]Guys, when Ben Franklin was writing up the goddamn fucking Declaration of Independence,
[150:22.45]There was no guggity guggity in there.
[150:24.74]There was no... Oh, yeah.
[150:25.76]We also need to make sure to leave some room for guggity guggity guggity guggity guggity guggity.
[150:30.52]There's no room for that, Ben.
[150:32.22]Goat cheese is so gross.
[150:34.52]Goat cheese is fucking vile.
[150:36.31]I... Honest to God, I feel like everybody that eats... People pretend to like goat cheese.
[150:40.49]You pretend to like it.
[150:42.57]I'm so serious.
[150:43.41]I will die on this hill.
[150:45.13]Goat cheese does not... It tastes like dirt.
[150:47.17]Goat cheese is this immediate.
[150:49.70]E-mediate.
[150:51.22]Like...
[150:53.22]flavor it's it's like right when it touches your lip it's just like oh what's on this go cheese it's like it's immediately oh goat cheese bro I love it oh dude I would I'll eat a ton of it on a cracker of course I will yeah right
[151:12.17]What if aliens don't have anything?
[151:14.19]Aliens could just be like, oh, wow, you have this thing over here that keeps your food from spoiling?
[151:20.29]Well, on our planet, fructose, we have, we got stuff.
[151:29.24]What's that over there?
[151:30.98]Wait.
[151:31.54]Oh, it's a calendar.
[151:33.02]What's that?
[151:33.40]You keep track of days?
[151:35.28]Who knows, guys.
[151:36.12]The fact that you can have sounds come out of your mouth might be the most absurd thing that they've ever heard.
[151:41.66]Hi, Mr. Alien.
[151:42.72]How are you?
[151:46.18]And their heads are going to explode.
[151:48.71]Exactly what I told you was going to happen.
[151:50.37]What?
[151:53.17]What is this?
[151:56.06]What is this?
[151:57.16]Why does this exist?
[151:58.46]This is magic powers!
[152:00.92]The game's fucking easy.
[152:03.20]It's not even a hard game.
[152:04.20]Instant kill moves are stupid.
[152:05.28]Delete them.
[152:06.10]Patch them out of the game.
[152:06.78]Instant kill moves are fucking... Delete them from the game.
[152:08.36]Instant kill moves, you should never have put those in the game.
[152:10.34]They're fucking stupid.
[152:11.08]Nobody likes them.
[152:11.70]Nobody, not one person likes them.
[152:12.84]Your health is just too low.
[152:13.74]He doesn't have any instant kill moves.
[152:16.28]Okay.
[152:17.14]If I... If I chop you up in a meat grinder, and the only thing that comes out that's left of you is your eyeball...
[152:26.47]Probably dead you're probably going to not you.
[152:30.26]I'm just saying like Okay, we're gonna take humans out of this if alien glob glob glob go one fucking shoots a disintegrating ray at alien glob glow to
[152:50.52]If there's only fucking teeth left, it's fucking, you're dead.
[152:55.21]You're dead.
[152:56.69]I've run my dishwasher because otherwise it'll get gross.
[153:02.25]I wash by hand.
[153:05.22]I don't like that idea of take, oh yeah, there's like a bunch of fucking like saucer and like mess on my plate.
[153:11.30]Just stick it in here and turn the water on.
[153:13.06]No, I don't like the dishwasher.
[153:15.31]I don't like it.
[153:15.95]And you know why also I don't like the dishwasher?
[153:18.76]All the people question marking me right now.
[153:21.14]So you enjoy putting, like, your dishes in this thing.
[153:24.79]And then, like, for, like, at least one to two fucking hours, you hear...
[153:37.26]It's fucking obnoxious.
[153:39.14]It's obnoxious.
[153:40.14]And it lasts for an hour.
[153:41.80]An hour.
[153:42.46]Two fucking hours of this.
[153:43.76]23.
[153:43.78]Isn't that a scary number?
[153:45.09]I like that number.
[153:45.93]23?
[153:45.97]Hold on.
[153:52.37]The scary thriller Jim Carrey movie, the number 23, is not based on any actual real folklore.
[154:01.10]I am not fucking around.
[154:02.70]I'm telling you the absolute honest to God truth.
[154:04.74]I've been afraid of that number since I've heard that movie and stuff.
[154:07.38]I don't know, man.
[154:07.98]How old was I?
[154:08.70]When did that movie come out?
[154:10.59]Like 20 fucking years ago?
[154:12.43]How old was I?
[154:13.67]I was probably like, I don't know.
[154:15.99]I don't know how old I was.
[154:16.99]I probably was very influenced.
[154:18.97]You were 23.
[154:24.71]What?
[154:25.59]2 divided by 3 is 666.
[154:26.37]That's what I'm saying, sir.
[154:28.72]What do you mean question marks?
[154:31.52]Yeah, it's an actually biblically accurate scary number.
[154:35.72]I don't want the afterlife to be like this.
[154:39.30]Every time people think of the afterlife.
[154:40.70]Oh, heaven.
[154:41.54]Oh, my God.
[154:42.06]I'm moving on.
[154:43.04]They're floating as a specter.
[154:45.46]Oh, wow.
[154:47.87]Look at it.
[154:48.35]So Elizabeth's mist everywhere.
[154:49.79]Everything's misty and you're floating.
[154:51.75]No, I don't want to be like this.
[154:53.27]I don't want to meet the caveman ancestor.
[154:57.44]They're all going to be there.
[155:00.54]I think we all think of, like, oh, Grandpa and Grandpa.
[155:05.16]And, like, Ooga.
[155:06.82]And Ooga is going to be there.
[155:09.69]I don't want to go to hell either because guess what?
[155:13.03]You know there's going to be somebody there that's going to be like, yeah, yeah, it's fire.
[155:18.13]Everything, man.
[155:18.69]I'm glad to be down here.
[155:19.99]I don't want to be with the one, like, distant great, great, great uncle that went to hell and hang out with him every day.
[155:27.17]Oh, that's going to be fun.
[155:28.85]Dice.
[155:31.33]Why is there... Why is there not an option?
[155:35.42]Should I even do this?
[155:36.40]I feel like everyone's waiting for me to do this.
[155:38.50]Okay, I'll do it in one sentence instead of like 25 sentences.
[155:43.11]So we're going to do that in one sentence instead of doing a 25 sentence explanation of what I mean by this.
[155:48.11]There is no add to cart option when you're trying to buy shit on Origin for The Sims.
[155:54.15]There's like a hundred things to buy individually.
[155:57.19]I got texted by my bank.
[155:59.17]Hey, we've declined purchases.
[156:00.37]There's like all these like fraudulent purchases going through the EA store.
[156:04.13]Like, no, that's me.
[156:05.61]That's me, and it's dumb.
[156:06.97]You have to go through the checkout process on each individual... Oh, one sentence.
[156:11.84]Shit.
[156:12.10]Fuck.
[156:13.66]I'm sorry.
[156:23.72]I tend to go off the rails.
[156:26.32]And that's not... I don't know.
[156:28.18]I just... I get on a topic, and I just don't stop.
[156:31.14]And people clip it, and then they send it away...
[156:34.48]So ladies and gentlemen, your winner for the best rant of 2022 is... It wasn't even close.
[156:41.19]At 54.7%, 55% is the meat grinder.
[156:47.65]The meat grinder, and then humans are not supposed to be doing this at 17.6.
[156:53.18]Alien panic at 9.1.
[157:05.46]It wasn't even close.
[157:08.42]Look, the meat, okay, let me defend myself.
[157:11.99]The meat grinder category, the meat grinder rant was,
[157:17.96]One person said something, and I was pretending like they were... It's a made-up person, right?
[157:24.83]This person doesn't exist.
[157:26.17]When I say you, I'm talking about you in general, not you watching right now.
[157:31.77]You in general.
[157:33.45]You in general.
[157:35.29]It's not a... Oh, I'm going to put you in a meeting.
[157:38.34]No, people are going to clip that too.
[157:39.96]So I'm just going to stop talking.
[157:42.98]When I say you, I mean just you in general, just you.
[157:46.23]Oh, you know, if I put you into a meat grinder, I'm not saying you individually, you get it, you understand.
[157:52.49]Moving right along.
[157:54.89]Now, here come the juicy ones.
[157:58.49]These are the juicy ones.
[158:00.35]There's so many categories left, we just got started.
[158:04.13]I tend to do impressions and some of them are very good, some of them are very bad.
[158:09.40]I think some of my impressions are good.
[158:11.74]Although people would tell me to do your impressions.
[158:13.36]Your impressions are terrible.
[158:15.14]So we'll start with the best.
[158:16.94]We'll go to the worst after.
[158:18.18]This is the best impressions.
[158:22.26]I think I did a pretty good job this year.
[158:25.40]This category, I mean, people are doing that emote and I can see it.
[158:28.24]They're like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[158:29.34]My head's bobbing around, whatever.
[158:31.76]You guys know what I mean when I say that shit though, right?
[158:34.20]You have to.
[158:36.00]I told Santa I wouldn't swear.
[158:37.68]So I'm gonna say, what the shoot?
[158:41.67]So here are your nominees for best impression of the year.
[158:46.72]These are the good ones.
[158:47.40]At least I hope they are.
[158:54.78]Now, make haste to the tower and defeat the evil witches.
[159:00.64]Mermaid man.
[159:01.40]Evil witches.
[159:07.07]No, we need to get into the boat and go get them, SpongeBob.
[159:14.49]What are you doing, you old moron?
[159:17.51]I am trying to do what it is a superhero must be doing.
[159:23.69]Getting to the bank.
[159:26.17]And who could forget getting it off there?
[159:29.61]The all-knowing.
[159:31.88]There he is.
[159:36.04]You drink?
[159:41.00]The orange-blue chieftain of the Badlands.
[159:45.42]The ever-knowing gold bastard.
[159:49.97]The disgusting Dung Eater.
[159:53.53]And of course, this sick idiot up there.
[159:57.89]The all-knowing... What's happening to my brain?
[160:01.77]I would have voted for that one.
[160:03.75]Meat, potatoes, and lettuce and fucking gravy.
[160:13.47]Spinach.
[160:15.46]And radishes.
[160:18.32]And I'm alive and I'm human.
[160:21.48]I like to eat too.
[160:24.15]And I like to have children.
[160:25.99]I'm here and I'm coming.
[160:28.47]I'm here and I'm coming.
[160:31.37]It's like, oh, parry the platypus.
[160:33.39]I'm going to take over the entire world, parry.
[160:36.12]No, it's Mitovich.
[160:37.20]But that was actually really, really good.
[160:38.62]And I would say that was probably the best one you've heard anybody do.
[160:41.62]Not showing anything under arrest.
[160:44.26]I'm underwater.
[160:47.69]Gentlemen, this is Tobacco Receive Manifest.
[160:53.65]Same voice.
[160:56.61]The chap over there joined, or by pay us this, is the bloke who got me on the penis.
[161:01.76]He has one voice.
[161:21.15]Tom Scott, this water is electrified.
[161:24.34]It will kill you if you stand within five feet of it.
[161:28.84]Oh, Bowser!
[161:33.87]Ah, annoying.
[161:36.71]Oh, boys and girls, it's-a me, Mario.
[161:41.57]Let me tell you something.
[161:43.53]If somebody want to tell you to take drugs, always say no.
[161:48.72]You see, Luigi tried to drink and do drugs one time, and I said no.
[161:54.52]And he said, Mario, and I said no.
[162:04.39]and that's the bottom line because stone cold said so pretty good they're eating her and then they're going to eat me oh my god remember please can you do a quick uh seinfeld uh routine about the word vast what even is vast what's that supposed to mean vast
[162:32.27]Just say big, just say large, say big.
[162:37.33]Why do we need names for so, why do we have so many names to describe what is effectively big?
[162:49.01]I mean, if you want my vote, I'm voting for Alex Jones.
[162:54.61]I don't think anybody does an Alex Jones like I can.
[162:57.31]I just, I gotta be really honest.
[163:00.22]Find me somebody that can do that as good as I can.
[163:04.50]People usually, you know, they go like this.
[163:06.14]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[163:07.26]Find me somebody that can do that better than me.
[163:10.29]I don't think you can.
[163:11.91]That's my vote.
[163:12.55]That's what I voted for.
[163:15.25]But your winner of the best impression of the year is...
[163:23.54]Of course, it's how petty the platypus, Doofenshmirtz.
[163:26.72]With 30% of the vote, that's a high one.
[163:29.79]Then Alex Jones right behind it.
[163:31.11]16.8, actually not right behind it, pretty far.
[163:36.35]Doofenshmirtz, Alex Jones, Doofenshmirtz, it's a hard word to say.
[163:40.09]And then Democracy Manifest Subtitles at 12.3%.
[163:43.82]Doofenshmirtz takes it.
[163:50.68]I think I can do a pretty good job.
[163:51.96]And now, obviously, I do a lot of these every year.
[163:59.49]And we're not just gonna talk about the good ones.
[164:02.60]We're gonna talk about the bad ones.
[164:05.28]This is the worst impression of the year.
[164:09.08]I don't agree with some of these.
[164:12.30]Let's be real.
[164:13.72]I don't agree with some of these.
[164:15.60]Some of these are a little like, I don't like that character, so I'm just gonna nominate it.
[164:19.95]That's not how this works.
[164:22.55]But just like the bad ones, there are also good ones, like what you just saw.
[164:25.77]Here are your nominees for the worst impression of the entire year.
[164:29.89]Did you do Jack Sparrow?
[164:43.02]Fuck, I'm done.
[164:44.20]My career is over.
[164:45.08]I'm ending my career.
[164:46.18]It's over today.
[164:47.26]Okay, so I got a letter.
[164:49.69]Jerry, when you read this letter, I will already be on the other side of the world.
[164:54.87]I'm sorry about that.
[164:56.33]I'm sorry that I'm not the father you wanted me to be.
[164:58.95]The rest is up to you.
[165:00.71]Do your best and live a wonderful life.
[165:03.26]You always will.
[165:04.40]That's the worst George I've ever heard.
[165:07.78]It's really not.
[165:08.38]That's what I mean.
[165:12.49]Hey, I'm Toad.
[165:13.95]I've been looking forward to this for quite a long time.
[165:16.35]Golf is more popular than ever in the Mushroom Kingdom.
[165:20.13]Wasn't that tourney yesterday incredible?
[165:24.10]But if we want to keep the sport interesting, we need some grand players, you see.
[165:29.94]And I just don't need folks who can hit the green.
[165:32.26]Oh, whoa.
[165:34.16]That's not even that bad.
[165:35.14]It really isn't.
[165:35.54]That's crazy.
[165:35.80]That's all I had to do was just clear my throat.
[165:38.01]We need some fresh faces on the leaderboard.
[165:44.17]Okay!
[165:44.81]That was bad.
[165:46.85]That was a really bad... I don't know if that was Toad or... I don't know what game that was from, but it was a bad impression.
[165:57.87]Skywalker, I must say, you are... Is that bad?
[166:03.01]It really was one word, elongated.
[166:05.44]Skywalker!
[166:07.60]You sound like the Swedish chef.
[166:10.50]Do we have a Bobby Hill impression?
[166:11.96]I'll try.
[166:13.81]yeah hey dad I'm sorry I can't but I tried what does cookie monster sound like it's like um what does it sound like it's kind of like cookies I love cookies right something like that let me try to let me go all in with it and see what happens
[166:41.23]This cookie is delicious.
[166:43.43]I love cookies.
[166:44.39]There's the heavy from TF2.
[166:46.63]That's not, that's not really, really not that good.
[166:49.63]But, I mean, it's, how do you even do it?
[166:52.39]Let me try to do a dog.
[166:54.26]Oh, Morty, we gotta be careful.
[166:57.62]Put that, get back in there and we're gonna go back in time to shave.
[167:00.88]Actually, it is different.
[167:01.88]Morty, Morty, we gotta be careful.
[167:06.53]Guys, I've never seen all these movies.
[167:07.63]I've never seen them.
[167:08.61]I just know... I know Christopher Lloyd.
[167:09.91]Christopher Lloyd!
[167:11.03]Right?
[167:14.07]His name's Morty, not Marty.
[167:15.51]Marty, not Morty.
[167:17.62]I just dropped everything.
[167:18.88]Do a Taz impression?
[167:20.66]Not on a sponsor stream.
[167:24.54]Whatever, why not?
[167:40.33]I was just about- Okay, Taz- Taz Mania was just about to do that.
[167:44.71]And somebody, like, Hitman style, like, put a fucking piano wire on his neck.
[167:51.55]Patrick?
[167:54.47]Hey, Spongebob!
[167:55.39]It's me, Patrick!
[167:58.04]Oh, yeah!
[167:58.72]Spongebob!
[167:59.68]Let's go have an adventure!
[168:01.22]What was wrong with this one?
[168:02.68]Does that sound like him?
[168:03.32]Kinda.
[168:03.84]Yeah, it does.
[168:04.50]Why was this on here?
[168:11.26]This one sucks.
[168:12.73]This is bad.
[168:14.05]Jeez, this one's the worst.
[168:16.47]Does this win?
[168:38.93]Voice is bad.
[168:39.59]Voice is bad.
[168:40.25]Shitty voice.
[168:40.81]Worst voice.
[168:41.45]Does that win?
[168:41.99]I... You want my vote.
[168:49.32]It's that one.
[168:51.76]Look.
[168:53.08]Okay.
[168:54.20]You have to... I am live.
[168:56.93]I don't know how many hours a year.
[168:59.33]But if I'm going to do an impression, sometimes you get shitty ones.
[169:02.65]Sometimes you get duds.
[169:04.59]I don't think the George was bad.
[169:07.69]Oh, that George Costanza was so bad.
[169:09.53]Jerry!
[169:10.55]How?
[169:11.63]Why would that be nominated that many times?
[169:14.36]I think that one was fine.
[169:17.50]Why was that so bad?
[169:19.24]Question marks.
[169:19.72]That sucked.
[169:21.58]Was it that bad?
[169:22.94]I don't think it was.
[169:23.78]I think you're mistaken here.
[169:26.94]They were all bad.
[169:27.76]The frog one definitely won.
[169:28.84]If it didn't, then there's something wrong with this community.
[169:31.28]Ladies and gentlemen, your winner of worst impression of the entire year is...
[169:37.22]What the fuck?
[169:39.18]It's not even in the top three.
[169:42.05]Toad was 23.2% of the vote.
[169:47.03]And then Jack Sparrow at 18.9.
[169:49.77]And then Patrick Star at 10.9%.
[169:54.37]One, two, and three.
[169:56.03]What?
[169:58.92]That frog was so bad.
[170:00.30]How is that not at like 80% of the vote?
[170:04.92]Alright.
[170:08.06]Time for the meaty categories.
[170:10.40]These are the ones that are full of flavor.
[170:13.72]I'm gonna take my time with these because this is my ego stroke here.
[170:18.69]It's time for an ego stroke.
[170:20.83]Until this one.
[170:22.13]But, you know.
[170:24.43]This next category is one that hits very deep to me and probably to those of you watching.
[170:30.47]This is for the best joke taking more than five minutes to set up.
[170:35.38]And what that means is that anything that took at least a few minutes to get rolling, okay?
[170:42.64]At least a few minutes to get rolling.
[170:44.88]So there were a lot of nominees, a lot of good ones, that I think, and you're swearing.
[170:49.80]Santa is already across the globe right now.
[170:52.45]He's a very busy person, so he'll be a very busy man.
[170:55.93]Ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees for the best joke of the year, taking more than five minutes to set up.
[171:06.30]Toad wasn't even bad.
[171:07.18]Stop.
[171:07.42]Don't you think that would add some atmosphere?
[171:14.25]If, like, after every major kind of area and every puzzle, there's, like, music played and you just heard... SCORN.
[171:19.89]That'd be kind of cool, I think.
[171:22.35]Oh, Jesus.
[171:24.26]Oh.
[171:24.94]What the fuck?
[171:26.30]SCORN.
[171:27.58]Blood.
[171:29.56]Lots of fucking blood.
[171:31.14]Lots of blood.
[171:32.30]That's a lot of blood.
[171:34.02]SCORN.
[171:35.92]I have to be better at fucking acting.
[171:38.64]True.
[171:45.18]I'm sorry, I can't do it.
[171:55.57]I don't- I look like a different person.
[171:57.99]Leave it on so the Twitch thumbnail gets it.
[172:01.30]Alright, fine.
[172:02.32]Make this the thumbnail.
[172:04.06]No, dude, I-
[172:09.61]This is fucking insane.
[172:11.51]I think we're going a little too far.
[172:13.49]I think we're going too far.
[172:14.83]Okay, are you ready for the culmination of what is the thumbnail right now?
[172:19.37]Here you go.
[172:21.63]Welcome to hell.
[172:27.31]Now listen, Buster.
[172:30.57]Once we get down here, I'm going to make sure that we take care of this as soon as possible.
[172:37.17]Now, I don't get that move at all.
[172:40.45]That move is absolutely unbelievable.
[172:43.55]It's one of those moves that you can't do anything about.
[172:45.50]And I'm telling you, yeah.
[172:48.12]You know what else is as ridiculous as that?
[172:50.10]Yeah, like we're going to get planes soon.
[172:51.78]Like I can fly eventually, too.
[172:54.92]How many fucking moves do you get before you... I'm sorry about that, folks.
[172:58.64]What I meant to say was, how many moves do you get to do in a row before, gosh darn it, you...
[173:03.87]How many moves do you need to do to get started?
[173:05.47]Or fucking wrong thing?
[173:07.31]Wrong thing.
[173:08.33]Alright, here we go.
[173:11.28]I made the medic.
[173:12.14]I'm good to go.
[173:12.82]Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
[173:20.42]Everyone I am on fire!
[173:38.36]I'm not eating bugs.
[173:39.46]I wouldn't eat bugs if my... if, like, my mother asked me to.
[173:43.68]What about a doctor?
[173:44.62]I don't know, what does the doctor look like?
[173:48.45]Is he like six feet tall?
[173:51.88]Like 200?
[173:52.94]Lean cut?
[173:53.96]What does he look like?
[173:55.20]And he is so fit.
[173:56.56]He just got done cycling.
[173:58.24]And he's got cycling shorts on.
[174:00.30]And a lab coat.
[174:01.34]Stop sharing your fantasy.
[174:03.64]Just got done with a quick bike ride.
[174:09.63]Kickstand.
[174:10.91]Comes in.
[174:12.09]Just like sweat just glistening off his forehead.

[175:00.69]They can't even hear me.
[175:03.01]Should I try to communicate?
[175:03.99]Hey, you, wait, look.
[175:08.69]Hey.
[175:11.11]Everybody, hey.
[175:11.99]I was on screen at a bar for those of you back there that don't know what's going on.
[175:16.52]I was typing and shit.
[175:20.82]Yeah!
[175:22.32]What about a Twitch moment badge for longest stream?
[175:26.76]Wait, can I do that?
[175:28.06]You were here for the longest stream I've ever done on this channel.
[175:33.75]13 hours, 19 minutes, and 41 seconds.
[175:38.67]Ain't ever gonna happen again.
[175:39.85]Should I do another moment?
[175:41.01]It's not, ever.
[175:47.81]I just left you fucked up 13 hours 27 minutes and six seconds I think that deserves a quick bite of pizza hey man you I can't believe you made it was on drugs like what was 13 hours 36 minutes and 52 seconds god man I can't believe you were here don't ever call the sus guy at 3 a.m
[176:19.16]Hey, dude, can you speak up?
[176:20.08]I'm in a construction site.
[176:22.72]I would vote for this one.
[176:24.08]I love this one.
[176:24.69]I don't know.
[176:29.33]Okay, hold on.
[176:35.43]Why would you even go live?
[176:37.43]Just wait till tomorrow.
[176:38.41]Like, who cares?
[176:39.63]Fucking keep your stream off.
[176:43.45]There's nothing I can do.
[177:03.07]Okay.
[177:06.95]What the fuck?
[177:08.99]What am I supposed to do?
[177:10.89]Guys, what does that mean?
[177:13.03]Whoa!
[177:14.85]A guy!
[177:16.67]Hold on.
[177:16.95]Watch out.
[177:17.27]I got it.
[177:17.51]I got it.
[177:17.73]I got it.
[177:18.01]I got it.
[177:21.93]I got to get this kill.
[177:23.35]Got to get this kill.
[177:24.09]Got to get this kill.
[177:26.18]Oh, I died.
[177:29.74]Shoot.
[177:30.64]What if I just like printed it to fall asleep on stream?
[177:34.61]Alright, I'm going to pretend to fall asleep on screen.
[177:37.55]I think this is both categories, by the way.
[177:39.31]Dude, wicked fucking tired.
[177:40.39]I had a long day.
[177:41.87]I hope it wins both.
[177:44.99]And then you're woken up by the jump scare.
[177:47.00]It might be a good idea to peek at those cameras while I talk, just to make sure everyone can see my face, you know.
[177:53.88]Interestingly enough, Freddy himself doesn't come off stage very often, but...
[178:06.34]yeah yeah so speaking of which such a bad man I'm here to do something that I said that I would never do and that's to play destiny 2. I love this part when he says I know I said I'd never do it but here we are that's the speed ship we're taking the speed ship to war
[178:31.48]You took everything from me, even though it's really actually not that bad.
[178:35.30]And I'm gonna watch the rest of your life.
[178:38.16]You better run.
[178:39.18]And you better never look back.
[178:40.94]Is this a Scooby-Doo van?
[178:42.44]Is this the Mystery Machine?
[178:46.36]It's too dark!
[179:23.14]Well, that was quite a year.
[179:27.72]Those are your top jokes voted by you, nominated by you.
[179:34.10]Let's find out, I'm sorry, I just punched you.
[179:36.89]Can I get some of this off my face too?
[179:38.77]This is gonna be permanent.
[179:40.99]I just did it again, what the hell am I doing?
[179:45.16]Ladies and gentlemen, the best joke of the year, taking more than five minutes to set up is... Oh, it's an upset.
[179:57.69]It's an upset.
[179:59.53]This is an upset.
[180:03.06]with 25% of the vote, 25%.
[180:07.80]The ultimate thumbnail.
[180:12.12]The huge thumbnail wins.
[180:14.28]And then SCORN, far away at 12.6% of the vote, far away.
[180:20.93]And then sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's with 10% of the vote.
[180:27.22]That's kind of an upset.
[180:28.22]I thought that SCORN, all the Scorners in the chat here,
[180:31.59]Probably gonna be pretty upset about that.
[180:35.41]Well, we did the good one.
[180:38.63]So why don't we do the bad one?
[180:41.89]If you think that I nail it every time, you're wrong.
[180:46.83]I have a tendency to, there's a couple of duds every year.
[180:49.73]Eh, a couple of duds.
[180:51.35]Not every joke is funny.
[180:53.70]I don't expect them to be.
[180:55.20]But how do you know if something's gonna be funny if you don't do it?
[180:58.75]Ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees for the worst joke of the year, taking five minutes to set up.
[181:14.10]What if I just pretended to fall asleep on stream?
[181:16.34]That's right, there it is.
[181:18.06]Alright, I'm gonna pretend to fall asleep on stream.
[181:21.00]I'm gonna put a text on the bottom that says like, dude, wicked fucking tired.
[181:24.34]I had a long day.
[181:28.45]And then you're woken up by the jump scare?
[181:30.13]Fuck!
[181:30.55]Yeah.
[181:30.71]Yeah.
[181:30.93]I don't know how I got into the Discord call, but I had so many help, I got the wrong, uh, server ID, I think.
[181:57.50]I don't know how I got in this Discord call, but somebody help.

[182:06.90]Where is, um... I don't know how I got in this Discord call, but I need somebody to help.

[182:15.70]Guys, I think I got in the wrong Discord call.
[182:17.76]I don't know how I got in here.
[182:18.68]I got the wrong server ID.
[182:19.70]I don't know what's happening.
[182:20.50]If somebody can troubleshoot with me, I think I have to go up here.
[182:23.32]Who is that guy?
[182:24.60]What a weird guy.
[182:25.36]That guy's weird.
[182:26.94]A lunatic.

[183:30.78]I knocked out that motherfucker in the parking lot, by the way.
[183:33.04]He looked at me weird.
[183:33.66]No, that sounds exactly what he deserved.
[183:35.50]I went like that to him.
[183:37.56]Show him your high kick.
[183:38.66]Yeah?
[183:39.51]I went like this.
[183:45.81]Hey, kids!
[183:47.81]Soda!
[183:52.83]This sucked so bad.
[183:54.21]Nobody move.
[183:55.19]It's starting to lag.
[183:55.96]It's starting to lag out.
[183:57.90]I'm starting to get sick, I think.
[184:00.44]I'm gonna get sick.
[184:02.08]I'm at like 20 frames a second.
[184:06.39]Oh god, it's getting sick!
[184:07.91]Here we go!
[184:12.00]Somebody said embarrassing.
[184:13.20]Oh, shit.
[184:14.12]Oh, shit.
[184:14.38]This is bad.
[184:15.42]Actually, be careful.
[184:16.16]This might actually be flashing lights and stuff.
[184:17.74]I'm not kidding.
[184:18.06]Half these awards are embarrassing.
[184:24.65]Okay, here you go.
[184:27.31]You ready?
[184:29.95]It's time for the latest episode of Breaking Bad.
[184:33.21]Your aunt owns this place, right?
[184:36.03]I own it.
[184:41.32]Fuck!
[184:44.98]This is fucking stupid.
[184:48.05]That was so bad.
[184:50.17]This is fucking dumb, man.
[184:52.19]This is dumb.
[184:53.59]If Jerma reads this, he has to do a push-up on stream.
[185:23.76]Oh fuck, oh fuck.
[185:33.06]I would've, I would've voted for Five Nights at Freddy's.
[185:38.30]That's what I would have voted for.
[185:42.19]But some of those I don't think deserve to be there.
[185:44.63]I really don't.
[185:46.49]Breaking Bad was just, I don't know, I was just reaching at that point.
[185:49.95]Because we were on the high of Scooby-Doo.
[185:52.45]What's new Scooby-Doo?
[185:53.91]Coming after you.
[185:55.31]Gonna find that.
[185:56.75]And it's like, wow, this is so much fun.
[185:58.27]I'm having so much fun.
[185:59.09]Oh, what are the TV shows?
[186:00.37]What are the television shows can we do, right?
[186:02.29]Yeah, I was reaching on the high.
[186:07.07]Ladies and gentlemen, your winner for worst joke of the entire year.
[186:12.11]The worst joke of the year is with 32% of the vote, someone got in the Discord.
[186:25.96]Someone got in the Discord and it wasn't me.
[186:27.84]Oh, someone's in the Discord.
[186:30.21]Sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's was 22%, but hold on a minute.
[186:35.32]So number two is sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's.
[186:38.32]Number three on best of the year was sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's.
[186:44.89]So it was top three on here and top three on here.
[186:48.37]You guys need to make up your mind.
[186:51.19]And then doing pushups was 16.8%.
[186:52.75]I would have voted for that one, probably.
[187:00.36]The Breaking Bad one was pretty awful, but you know.
[187:05.17]I'm not looking forward to these next couple categories.
[187:13.05]These videos are probably 10 minutes long.
[187:15.47]Something about the worst and best noise categories this year.
[187:19.94]I mean, the mods went through it.
[187:22.74]Me and Holly went through it.
[187:25.02]We had to narrow this down.
[187:27.48]Best and worst noise of the year.
[187:30.87]There were 60 nominees until we really had to get rid of some.
[187:36.03]I think we brought it down to like 25 in each category.
[187:39.29]So strap in, turn your volume down.
[187:42.81]Because here are your nominees for best noise of the year.
[187:51.92]Or turn your volume up if that's what you care about.
[187:54.00]Oh, Jesus.
[187:58.20]Oh, what the fuck?
[188:00.20]Score.
[188:05.61]What the fuck?
[188:07.15]How long do you think I can hold a Wilma for?
[188:08.75]Wilma!
[188:11.68]That was fucking long, dude.
[188:30.01]I tried to walk over to my water in VR.
[188:31.77]Hold on, that's not how that works.
[188:33.25]Oh, I got a drink too.
[188:37.89]That's pretty sus!
[188:39.07]Dude, there was a cricket outside last night.
[188:42.07]I swear to God, I always wanted to record it.
[188:43.91]Like, just get audio recorded.
[188:45.30]Because this thing was so loud.
[188:47.50]And it was going super speed.
[188:51.18]It wasn't... This guy was looking for somebody.
[188:57.98]It was like...
[189:04.15]Just like, what is it?
[189:05.25]It was a hurt.
[189:05.91]It was like static.
[189:06.79]I couldn't stand it.
[189:08.04]You know what sound that makes too.
[189:10.30]It's like.
[189:10.66]You just like that because it sounds like the teacher noise.
[189:16.60]I can put it over my head.
[189:21.27]Moving an amount of water from one room to another.
[189:24.09]And go like this.
[189:30.61]Should I do this?
[189:31.87]Okay, I'll do it.
[189:37.55]No, no, I just heard that in my head.
[189:39.69]That hurt.
[189:40.07]I heard somebody laugh off camera.
[189:50.40]This is the Tasmanian devil in the electric chair.
[189:53.76]Okay.
[189:54.50]This is not, doesn't sound right at all.
[189:56.98]And let's do a scream test.
[189:59.46]Fixed it.
[190:01.04]How can we look plastic today?
[190:09.82]I mean, I don't feel plastic.
[190:14.74]Dung, dung, dung, dung.
[190:19.55]Oh, dude, 2-1 up.
[190:20.51]That was pretty good.
[190:22.49]Let's see this power.
[190:42.46]Oh, no.
[190:43.02]It's one of those... Are you wearing red because you're the imposter?
[190:45.85]Yes.
[191:00.59]When I'm lying in my deathbed and I'm connected to like about you know what it's I'm like 90 or something like a hundred and everyone's like gathered around the bed and everyone's like oh let's get to say goodbye to grandpa right you bet your ass that I'm gonna be like You bet your fucking ass that's the last thing I'm leaving you with.
[191:25.84]Oh, they're sucking me up!
[191:58.15]How many people are here right now on the channel?
[192:02.68]Do we have a number?
[192:03.20]65.
[192:06.64]There's 65,000 people here.
[192:12.07]And you just got subjected to that.
[192:14.69]So should I apologize?
[192:18.55]Or should we wait?
[192:20.53]Should we wait for this one?
[192:24.12]I'm going to hold my apologies till this one.
[192:28.23]Ladies and gentlemen, the, oh, I may have ripped it.
[192:31.85]The winner for best noise of the entire year.
[192:36.39]Was it ever gonna be close?
[192:39.83]Let's spam it in the chat.
[192:42.43]You know what it is.
[192:43.55]Spam it.
[192:45.34]I'll do it if you spam it.
[192:47.28]I'll do it if you spam it.
[192:48.32]Mm-hmm.
[192:56.64]Scored.
[192:59.42]With 39% of the vote, SCORN absolutely killed it.
[193:07.04]Gimme, gimme, gimme was only 15.
[193:10.06]SCORN absolutely dominated this category.
[193:13.28]And then Are You the Imposter was three.
[193:17.22]So SCORN, a SCORN sweep right there, 40% of the vote almost.
[193:20.78]39.7% actually.
[193:25.14]Which is, that's a lot.
[193:26.80]So to the almost 60, 70,000 people that are here right now, I apologize for this next category.
[193:33.05]I apologize in advance.
[193:34.75]I said a lot of sorries already, but it's time for another one.
[193:38.83]I'm sorry about this category.
[193:42.32]Most nominees, I think, total.
[193:45.08]That had to get dwindled down, but...
[193:48.62]We have a best noise, we have a worst noise.
[193:51.28]They could just be the same category.
[193:54.52]I should just do a thing where it's just noise of the year because why even have two categories?
[194:01.66]Here are your nominees for worst noise of the year.
[194:27.14]It's just, you know what I mean?
[194:28.24]It's just the... It doesn't even lather up either.
[194:34.70]I'm so... That was bad.
[194:44.24]You've seen me do it like a hundred times.
[194:50.38]You can't dodge them all.
[195:00.57]He's turning.
[195:01.73]Oh, shit.
[195:02.29]He's turning.
[195:03.49]He just growled at us.
[195:05.33]Wrong game.
[195:06.29]Wrong game FromSoftware.
[195:07.64]Wrong game.
[195:21.26]Aaah! Ah! Eee! Eek!
[195:44.87]like some people eat a lobster like it's literally the last thing they're ever gonna eat in their entire life and they like what's in here oh and it's just like god damn it what are you doing oh there's some still in there and I just want I just I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it at all it's revolting it's absolutely fucking relax
[196:14.70]Young Madoc, apprentice to Hunwit, the dream chanter, removes his instrument from its case.
[196:20.09]Its features, composed, take on a startling dignity.
[196:22.97]Let's hear it.
[196:43.79]This is on here twice?
[196:47.35]How many times was this nominated?
[196:55.64]Can I just say this is the worst moment of the whole year?
[196:58.26]I can say that, right?
[196:58.92]It's my channel.
[197:01.88]That's it?
[197:02.26]It goes like...
[197:11.91]I just threw one of those Nerf... You know those Nerf whistlers?
[197:17.02]The thing that, like, Brett Favre was in the commercial and he threw it, like, ah, look, there's, I can throw this 100 yards.
[197:21.64]And it goes... I just threw one of those.
[197:26.98]Okay, back to business.
[197:32.31]Now I know what this is for.
[197:33.59]We're all the way over here.
[197:35.11]What's wrong with Jared's limit?
[197:40.50]Hold on.
[197:40.98]No.
[197:41.24]Oh, life.
[197:41.58]Here comes a backpedal.
[197:49.84]I'm sorry, everybody in production probably just cringed.
[197:58.69]Did you guys hear that?
[197:59.33]What the fuck was that?
[198:07.41]There is recency bias, I think, on this one.
[198:10.86]We have some recency bias, I think.
[198:14.04]I don't think, I can literally see it through the paper, by the way.
[198:19.88]I peeked.
[198:23.45]Ladies and gentlemen, the worst noise of the entire year, recency bias, come on.
[198:29.93]The multiverse's squeal at 20% of the vote, not that bad.
[198:36.86]Growls at chat with 18.8.
[198:38.12]And I don't even, I don't know what this one is.
[198:44.33]Suck, snort, wheeze, cackle.
[198:47.83]Do we even know, what is that one?
[198:50.39]Suck, snort, wheeze, cackle.
[198:52.53]I was trying to watch, but I couldn't even, I don't know what that one is.
[198:57.54]Very good to know.
[198:58.24]A third most skipped category.
[199:04.22]13% of you that took the test did not take this one.
[199:08.22]You're like, fuck it, I don't want to hear that.
[199:09.75]I don't care.
[199:11.37]Which makes sense considering there's so many categories.
[199:14.31]And okay, but MultiVersus Squeal.
[199:17.41]Hey, MultiVersus is a great game.
[199:19.03]You should try it.
[199:20.43]You know what?
[199:21.27]Can we check in with the puzzle room?
[199:23.73]Let's take a look at the puzzle room.
[199:24.75]How's the puzzlers doing?
[199:32.61]No one's doing anything.
[199:36.83]Have they not done any of the puzzle?
[199:41.44]Zero?
[199:42.12]Hold on.
[199:44.10]There's only one person doing it.
[199:46.06]I'm going in there.
[199:48.92]There's only one, they're all just like eating sandwiches.
[199:51.41]I need to see the progress.
[199:53.85]Oh God.
[200:05.82]I'm not going to be angry.
[200:06.62]Hi, everybody.
[200:19.99]It seems as if there is, it looks like you've blocked out some areas.
[200:28.25]Can you get this?
[200:30.37]Where's the camera?
[200:32.23]Can you see this over here?
[200:35.34]They have one edge of one of the corners.
[200:41.50]What have you been doing in here?
[200:43.72]What's going on?
[200:44.28]What are you doing here?
[200:44.96]What is this?
[200:46.08]You playing cards?
[200:47.40]Yeah.
[200:53.27]Excuse me.
[200:56.85]What?
[201:01.19]Santa said to be nicer.
[201:04.97]So if you could please finish one section.
[201:16.91]This was a lot of money.
[201:19.55]This cost a lot of money.
[201:20.87]You heard Ludwig, and you heard H. Rucker.
[201:22.53]By the way, where the fuck are they?
[201:24.91]Sorry if I swear.
[201:26.42]You know what?
[201:29.44]They're drinking.

[201:43.19]I'll be the dealer.
[201:44.99]Where are the cards?
[201:46.27]Let's go Blackjack.
[201:47.59]What are these comically huge cards?
[201:52.28]Hey, by the way, is this the Ace of Clubs?
[201:55.22]Nope.
[201:55.44]That would have been fucking insane if it was.
[201:58.30]You want to go Blackjack?
[201:59.16]Ready?
[201:59.40]You know how to play Blackjack?
[202:01.60]You got this.

[202:12.84]We were hoping.
[202:13.82]You just wanted to see Avatar 2, The Way of Water.
[202:16.54]We don't pay us enough to go watch it ourselves.
[202:19.90]What does this one say?
[202:22.64]Send hot cups of sa- that's a funny joke.
[202:25.98]What does this one say?
[202:28.28]My name is Danny Elfman.
[202:29.60]Please hurry.
[202:32.43]I actually don't get it.

[203:52.50]Don't give it to him.
[203:54.30]Santa, if you're watching, I'm just being funny.
[203:57.08]Give me that toy.
[203:57.66]I made sure to not.
[204:01.40]5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60.
[204:03.07]You just paid $60.

[204:33.48]Merry Christmas!
[204:34.58]Merry Christmas!
[204:38.66]Yes!
[204:40.22]Yes!

[204:41.80]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[204:44.04]Can't do math?
[204:45.88]What happened?
[204:48.16]I can't do math.
[204:48.91]What happened?
[204:50.99]Did I get it?
[204:51.55]Wait.
[204:52.41]Count those cards.
[204:53.29]Hold on a second.
[204:56.79]This is 17.
[204:57.09]That's 10.
[204:57.67]18.
[204:57.69]What are you talking about?
[205:02.08]She won.
[205:03.46]We can't count.
[205:04.28]That's literally 18 versus 7.
[205:05.50]What are you talking about?
[205:06.51]I'm a man of my word.
[205:09.21]So guess what?
[205:10.95]All the elves in this area, you're going to split $60.
[205:22.96]Elves! Elves! Elves! Elves! Elves! Elves! Elves! Elves!
[205:28.20]Thirteen elves!
[205:29.08]Ladies and gentleman, thirteen elves!
[205:29.98]Divided. 60 devided by 13 is?
[205:34.00]$100.
[205:40.00]That's like 2 bucks each.
[205:40.00]Hey how about this?
[205:40.00]We're gonna double your pay.
[205:52.68]I don't know how much they were getting paid anyways.
[205:58.26]Whatever.
[205:58.62]I mean, they were paid to do a puzzle, and they didn't do it.
[206:02.67]Let me make sure.
[206:03.15]Let me be very clear.
[206:05.15]They were paid.
[206:05.99]All those people were paid to be here.
[206:10.13]They were all paid to be here to do a puzzle.
[206:15.08]How much income is that worth?
[206:17.44]I'll double their pay.
[206:18.52]Fine.
[206:19.40]Yeah.
[206:22.56]How about this?
[206:23.00]Hey, elves, can you hear me?
[206:25.56]Elves, you can hear me, right?
[206:28.92]How about this?
[206:30.68]You get one section done, and I mean even a border, and I'll quadruple your pay.
[206:40.54]I wonder if they'll do it.
[206:44.82]I will five times your pay.
[206:47.82]Get a border done.
[206:52.69]100 each?
[206:54.11]Look, now they're all standing.
[206:56.21]Now they're all ready to go.
[206:57.49]They're like, holy shit, let's go.
[207:04.55]They were all sitting before.
[207:06.05]Now, hey, can we give it up for the elves?
[207:10.72]In the chat, give it up for the elves.
[207:13.74]Hey, hey, hey, you know what?

[207:47.67]A one guy.
[207:49.70]is when somebody kind of derails the stream.
[207:54.88]I will see it, I will comment on it, and it changes the outcome of the rest of the day.
[208:01.46]It's not just, oh yeah, yeah, I read a comment.
[208:03.22]No, no, no, no.
[208:04.20]A one guy moment is you've changed the course of history completely.

[208:12.84]The best one guy moment of the year.
[208:24.93]I'm not going to encourage this behavior, but I'm going to tell you something right now.
[208:29.30]This is not to be encouraged, but it was just like, what the fuck, man?
[208:33.98]Somebody asked what the baseball stream is.
[208:36.58]And I said, whatever.
[208:37.46]And then it's been like five minutes.
[208:39.28]It's been like at least five minutes.
[208:40.80]Somebody added that person, I think, and said he's going to shove an entire baseball up his ass on stream.
[208:47.02]This person's name, too.
[208:48.58]Yeah.
[208:49.02]What the fuck?

[211:15.52]Gary.
[211:17.74]You fucking idiot.
[211:19.60]Did you have to get the red cinnamon apple candle from Yankee Candle and put it in every room?
[211:24.79]Somebody said just eat a handful.
[211:29.35]That would be so fucked up.
[211:32.11]You'd probably have like a fucking mental breakdown.
[211:37.49]It's not designed for that.
[211:38.90]Eat a handful?
[211:39.74]That would be fucking disgusting.
[211:44.94]I'm kind of curious.
[211:46.10]I'm curious.
[211:46.62]Let's go.
[211:59.21]It tastes like hamburger meat.
[212:00.97]It tastes like hamburger meat.
[212:03.51]Do a Mario drug PSA?
[212:12.81]Hi, ladies and gentlemen.
[212:20.52]I'm Super Mario.
[212:22.88]We've made a lot of jokes here today.
[212:23.98]We've had a lot of fun.
[212:25.52]And I'm an actor.
[212:27.81]But let me just be the first to tell you that, you know, it's not fun.
[212:30.41]What is not totally byahu?
[212:34.16]Drugs and alcohol.
[212:36.02]This is by somebody in the community.
[212:37.20]Are they comfortable with you sharing their name?
[212:38.90]I don't want to share their name if they're not comfortable.
[212:42.30]But anyways, they discovered a new way of isolating viruses that kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
[212:50.43]Somebody in this community.
[212:53.77]And the first one I discovered using this method, I named after Jerma.
[212:58.23]This is apparently it fucking working.
[213:01.41]Against bacteria, antibiotic bacteria resistant shit.
[213:06.11]That's me in there.
[213:07.84]That's me taking care of that.
[213:10.78]I'm in there and I'm getting all of those fucking molecules and I'm destroying them.
[213:14.38]Make a sandwich with wood.
[213:24.04]A wood sandwich.
[213:28.78]I can't.

[213:39.55]Okay.
[213:43.69]I fucking quit the goddamn game.
[213:44.83]I exited the fucking game.
[213:49.97]What the fuck is happening?
[213:53.77]If Jerma reads this, he has to do a push-up on stream.
[214:23.91]Oh fuck, oh fuck.
[214:26.19]The ring light around your neck.
[214:30.33]If I put the ring light around my neck, it could actually fit.
[214:36.54]That would be fucking stupid.
[214:38.38]Wait a minute.
[214:50.94]Nice swag, thanks.
[214:53.32]I was told that if I spin 100 times at $10, starting with $1,000 on this slot machine, that I will be able to get to $10,000 plus.
[215:03.79]There's a person in chat here who is putting their stream chat life here.
[215:10.11]They're going to be banned from the channel if it doesn't work, or they're going to get VIP'd if it does.
[215:13.15]Three.

[215:49.53]Can I try it?
[215:49.87]Hold on.
[215:51.81]Can I scream?

[216:04.60]How?
[216:05.30]No, I'm not.
[216:06.24]Someone tell Jerma I can tell them how to fix their save.
[216:09.08]How do I do it?
[216:09.64]How do I do it?
[216:10.70]How do I do it?

[216:21.28]Oh, Dev.
[216:21.86]Looks like you're having a little bit of trouble with geometry, aren't you?
[216:27.18]Looks like the Dev is having a little bit of trouble with geometry.
[216:29.56]Dev, when was the last time you were in fucking high school?
[216:34.14]When was... I am going to get so validated right now.
[216:37.48]I suck at math.
[216:41.07]I suck at math.
[216:41.93]I am in my 30s.

[226:50.40]Relax, holy shit, dude.
[226:51.58]Are you kidding me?
[226:52.93]This is not even scary.
[226:55.01]Did I just fake that?
[226:56.01]No, I really didn't, I swear to God, but like, that was way overre- I haven't played a scary game in a long time.
[227:08.02]Oh my god, how am I alive?

[227:48.04]I think I shut my computer.
[227:49.92]I think I shut my computer down.
[227:57.99]Wow.
[227:58.29]A lot of scares this year.
[228:00.35]A lot of scares.
[228:05.28]I want to know what you guys picked.
[228:07.66]No fanfare.
[228:08.80]Let's go.
[228:11.04]Yeah.
[228:15.01]It technically happened last year.
[228:19.21]Wearing the same clothes.
[228:21.59]The volume warning puppet combo scare with 20% of the vote.
[228:26.99]It's the one where it looked like I saw a mouse go through the bottom of the screen there.
[228:32.72]It looks like, yeah, I mean, come on.
[228:36.42]Charborg Corner Jumpscare with Among Us is at 13.7, number two, 13.7.
[228:42.97]And then Iron Lung at 7.3%, number three.
[228:47.91]I mean, the cutoff of the awards was right at that Puppet Combo stream last year.
[228:54.45]So, honestly, I think a couple of years came off my life after that.
[229:00.58]I felt awful after that stream.
[229:04.14]I think I remember talking about it later, being like, I feel bad.
[229:09.54]I feel awful.
[229:10.06]I have a headache.
[229:11.37]My chest hurts.
[229:12.33]It actually felt terrible after that.
[229:15.41]Anyways, we are getting to the final seven awards.
[229:19.55]This is getting juicy.
[229:21.57]I've said that four or five times, but it is.
[229:24.88]Time to get to the big ones.
[229:29.54]Now,
[229:31.01]Every year, I like to sing some songs.
[229:34.93]I sing, I get involved, I enunciate, and we're going to show you now some of those nominees for what that means when it's good.
[229:46.94]Not bad when it's good.
[229:49.82]Here are your nominees for the best singing of the year.
[230:00.09]Hopefully it's good because I haven't seen this.

[230:15.19]You got a friend in me.
[230:20.29]Where the road looks rubberhead and you're miles and miles from your nice war bed.
[230:29.90]You didn't remember what your old pal said, but you got a friend in me.
[230:36.70]Fucking failed every time.
[231:00.95]Oh, you're playing Dark Souls?
[231:07.91]Hey son, what game are you playing?
[231:14.28]Oh, I wonder.
[231:16.24]The only thing I remember from Arcane was... Oh, the misery.
[231:22.04]Every single person is my enemy.
[231:24.02]That's the only thing I know.
[231:26.63]I don't know anything else.
[231:33.50]I find that mystery.
[231:35.70]This is Scooby-Doo coming after you.
[231:38.77]Scooby-Doo.
[231:41.41]This is the fucking new Zoomer shit.
[231:42.86]This is not what I want.
[231:47.86]Oh!
[231:48.06]I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot!
[232:16.51]Not this one, I hope not.
[232:17.73]Scared?
[232:21.17]That's what you want.
[232:44.98]I'm going to march out here and just start singing fucking John Jingleheimer Schmidt.
[232:54.26]What are you doing now?
[232:54.94]You're supposed to be scared.
[232:57.17]John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.
[233:00.47]His name is my name too.
[233:03.77]Whenever we go out, we always shout, here comes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.
[233:09.58]Why is this?
[233:10.30]Is this in the other one too?
[233:11.40]Get in the bathtub quick.
[233:12.74]This is terrible.
[233:13.26]Sing, chat, a lullaby.
[233:17.31]Little baby, don't say a word.
[233:18.37]I'm gonna buy you a mockingbird.
[233:19.55]If that mockingbird don't sing, I'm gonna buy you an iron ring.
[233:21.77]If that diamond ring don't shine, I'm gonna buy you a glass of wine.
[233:28.87]When you get old enough, over 21.
[233:29.89]Can we get an apples and bananas remix?
[233:34.44]Are you talking about like the... I want to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas.
[233:40.74]That's what you mean?
[233:41.82]I like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas.
[233:47.20]And feel like I belong.
[233:50.93]Alright, give up.
[233:51.59]This one's good.
[233:52.97]I can go the distance.
[233:57.51]I'll be there someday.
[234:01.44]If I can be strong I know every mile Will be worth my while I would go most anywhere To feel like I belong Well
[234:30.36]I like that last one.
[234:31.60]That was pretty good.
[234:33.22]But we'll see what you think.
[234:35.38]Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of best singing of the year is... I don't know if production has it ready, but I'll just wait till you do.
[234:46.80]Can we just play it?
[234:47.50]Can we just play it?
[234:48.94]Can we just play it?
[234:53.12]You know what won.
[234:53.82]Can we just play it through?
[234:55.36]DMCA, I know.
[234:56.38]The channel will get shut down, but who gives a shit?
[235:00.54]They don't have it.
[235:01.92]Okay, it's with 31.1%, 31% of the vote is, oh, the misery.
[235:12.45]Okay.
[235:13.75]At number two with 25%, all the Hatsune Miku fans, popipo, and then Hercules, go the distance, which was actually the good one.
[235:22.53]That was the good one.
[235:23.63]At 9.85%, good job, by the way, good job.
[235:28.57]There you go.
[235:29.97]But now, I do want to do something very special.
[235:34.30]We saw them earlier.
[235:36.04]Didn't really get a chance to show off what they could actually do.
[235:40.54]Feel like it's a good place to do it though.
[235:42.85]Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back into the studio, Top Shelf Vocal!
[235:51.94]We'll get a couple of actual good songs here.
[235:55.02]And I'm going to get out of here because I shouldn't be here.

[238:28.77]Every world rejoices for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

[239:42.20]Thank you.
[239:42.78]You all out here to actually do a song.
[239:44.94]Thank you.
[239:46.48]So with that...
[239:48.37]Now, don't listen.
[239:49.07]I don't want you guys to, don't listen to this.
[239:52.28]We're gonna go to the next category, which is maybe the worst singing of the year.
[239:57.66]Maybe.
[239:58.98]I sing, you've heard me, I've sung before a few times.
[240:02.44]A couple times, yeah.
[240:04.46]Here are your nominees for the worst singing of the year.
[240:08.77]Right after that great performance.
[240:15.05]You guys killed it, that was fucking amazing.
[240:21.40]What do you mean Bjork?
[240:26.07]I don't sound like Bjork.
[240:29.25]What do you mean?
[240:31.11]And then somebody says Bjork, and I'm like, fuck!
[240:47.50]That's how you get punched in the face.
[241:07.84]We're all good friends and we all get together sometimes When you're feeling down and you're feeling out of luck and out of change We will work together and we will have... I'm sorry.
[241:20.30]That's what I expected.
[241:21.64]That's what I expected.
[241:22.64]I expected that.
[241:24.26]She's such a misfit Always ready to fight She's got a super beam And she's raising high If you believe you're strong So you know the whole song?
[241:37.88]I heard like a minute of... Sing a goodnight song for Boba.
[241:49.90]Boba, the kitty.
[241:52.76]Have a good rest.
[241:56.58]See you in the morning.
[242:00.23]Boba, such a good kitty.
[242:05.64]See you in the morning.
[242:08.80]Good morning.
[242:09.48]Good morning.
[242:10.16]Good morning to you all.
[242:11.58]Good morning.
[242:12.30]Good morning.
[242:14.52]I'm going to take a fall.
[242:17.36]It's such a wonderful world we live in in this nice street.
[242:20.52]We're almost there.
[242:21.14]Here we are.
[242:24.08]Oh, the misery.
[242:25.44]Every single person is my enemy.
[242:31.78]Here it goes, here it goes.
[242:33.26]We go from Nashville to Norway, to Zimbabwe, to Chicago, to Czechoslovakia.
[242:41.12]And back.
[242:41.86]Fucking God, dude.
[242:49.16]All the weather outside is bright.
[242:51.90]What's wrong with this?
[242:52.80]I got fire, solar light.
[242:56.81]Since we... Since we no place... Hold on.
[243:01.36]Since we no place... I'll get it.
[243:03.84]Shut up.
[243:05.36]Since we no place to go.
[243:08.34]Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
[243:11.80]Use that part.
[243:13.12]What was wrong with that?
[243:13.74]That was fine.
[243:17.32]You've got a friend in me.
[243:20.99]Got a friend in me.
[243:23.57]Certain people...
[243:25.25]Having more of a laugh than I have.
[243:28.41]That's it, right?
[243:29.03]Alright, I'm going to count you guys in, okay?
[243:33.21]Three, two, one, go.
[243:35.75]She sang over the hills.
[243:37.53]It instantly voice jammered me.
[243:43.25]Take your headphones out.
[243:44.53]Wait, wait, wait.
[243:45.75]Sir, sir, take out your headphones.
[243:47.45]Okay.
[243:47.83]Ready?
[243:48.83]Three, two, one.
[243:51.10]She sang over the hills.
[243:52.90]Peaks are shy, but sure don't.
[243:56.20]And sure, as the sun rise, I'll someday be gone.
[243:59.34]But recall me, my love, and our joy may live on.
[244:05.52]And you do, and you do, and you do.
[244:10.53]That's a howl at the end.
[244:11.31]That has to be a howl at the end.
[244:22.47]Some of those weren't that bad.
[244:26.54]I mean, cringe, is it like a most cringe category?
[244:30.12]Maybe, no.
[244:33.42]After Top Shelf Vocal, I know.
[244:41.31]These were close.
[244:44.53]It was pretty much every single nominee.
[244:46.31]15.5, 14.4, 13.9, 13, 12,
[244:54.71]It's all of them, you couldn't choose.
[244:57.61]But if you had to, with 15.5% of the vote, it's Bjork.
[245:02.25]Bjork wins.
[245:04.01]And then right underneath that 14.4% was Beatbox Oh The Misery, and then 13.9% was the Splatoon 3 Laughing Song.
[245:10.86]I mean, the Bjork,
[245:24.74]That stream, I would have nominated for worst stream of the year.
[245:28.79]Is it in there?
[245:30.57]It might be.
[245:32.67]Alright, let's count the categories.
[245:35.03]We've got one, two, three, four, five.
[245:38.77]We've got, what, five or six categories remaining?
[245:40.87]These are the huge ones.
[245:42.87]These are the major, massive categories.
[245:48.05]Are you ready?
[245:48.42]How you guys feeling?
[245:51.10]You guys in the Christmas spirit?
[245:52.76]Holiday spirit?
[245:55.48]Yeah.
[245:57.08]Can you please do a Bjork?
[246:03.31]Yeah.
[246:06.11]Pretty good.
[246:10.79]Pretty good.
[246:12.93]I tried.
[246:15.83]Bjork is a very talented singer, by the way.
[246:18.63]More talented than I will ever be times 100.
[246:22.99]Just make that clear.
[246:23.63]I have nothing on Bjork.
[246:26.08]Zero.
[246:32.08]What's that say?
[246:34.50]That is best gamer moment of the year.
[246:38.29]Did I do good in a game?
[246:39.93]Did I play Call of Duty versus a hacker?
[246:43.71]Who may have been cheating, we don't know.
[246:47.75]See him for lunch or dinner on Friday.
[246:51.36]Extinguisher if you still hear me.
[246:55.25]I like extra lettuce on my hamburgers.
[246:57.79]I like crunch.
[247:00.18]Best gamer moment of the year incoming.
[247:02.12]These are the moments that I actually did very well.
[247:06.10]Not this one.
[247:07.38]Don't look at that one yet.
[247:08.42]It's not time for that one.
[247:09.74]We're gonna put that down and we're gonna show you the nominees for best gaming moment of the year.
[247:16.85]This is when I did well.
[247:17.89]Here are your nominees.
[247:23.94]Somebody's probably actually insane.
[247:25.64]Ban that person for an hour.
[247:30.17]And then, like, you bet, like, a little bit there, and then maybe I'd be like, you know, what's 50 more?
[247:36.77]You know what I mean?
[247:38.01]It's a nominal amount.
[247:39.05]It's a nominal amount.
[247:40.17]Somebody said Elmo.
[247:41.33]What does that mean?
[247:45.31]Jerma, you absolute idiot.
[247:49.10]Am I stupid?
[247:49.86]Because I just won the game.
[247:57.64]That's a three of a kind.
[247:58.78]You just got shot.
[248:11.21]Were you here?
[248:12.27]Were you in the room?
[248:13.81]Were you in the fucking room?
[248:15.96]I got a bet for you.
[248:17.54]Can I complete my own mini golf course in less than 20 strokes?
[248:23.66]Six.
[248:27.22]And seven.
[248:28.56]Here comes seven.
[248:30.50]Motherfuckers, you didn't think I was gonna skip the whole goddamn course?
[248:38.64]Yes!
[248:39.10]You all lose.
[248:47.79]You all lose.
[248:49.81]Never bet against me again.
[248:52.77]What's happening?
[248:53.71]Am I winning?
[248:57.86]I don't know.
[248:58.38]Did I just- Did I win?
[249:12.99]Why won't he fight me?
[249:17.87]Hurry up!
[249:18.29]Run!
[249:20.97]God damn it!
[249:21.83]I knew it was a problem.
[249:25.63]I have to be off to this guy before he rings the alarm.
[249:32.58]Fuck, come on.
[249:38.51]Why is he so much faster than me?
[249:46.00]I got him.
[249:58.10]I beat him!
[250:06.22]Some pretty good moments.
[250:08.80]That game is so hard.
[250:10.62]They made it too hard.
[250:13.18]ULTRAKILL, devs, if you're watching.
[250:16.26]Your game's too hard.
[250:19.04]Hardest game at Walmart.
[250:21.11]It's not even at Walmart.
[250:24.13]No, that's an old callback.
[250:26.09]The game's hard, just to let you know.
[250:28.43]Anyways, ladies and gentlemen, the winner of best gamer moment of the year is... This was huge.
[250:42.08]44.6%.
[250:43.08]Almost 45% of the vote.
[250:46.04]The ultimate poker bluff versus Ludwig wins.
[250:51.40]Hey, come on.
[250:53.27]Took all his money.
[250:54.93]He's here somewhere.
[250:55.63]He's back there somewhere.
[250:57.13]Sorry, Ludwig.
[250:59.08]Beachy and Poker, it's my game.
[251:01.96]And then after the first try Cuphead DLC boss at what, 14.8%?
[251:07.93]That's not even close.
[251:09.89]And then beating Ulcerated Tree Spirit early.
[251:14.99]What's so impressive?
[251:15.61]You beat the Tree Spirit, who cares?
[251:17.77]That was like 30 levels too early.
[251:20.01]I accidentally walked into that boss.
[251:22.37]So that's pretty impressive, I think.
[251:26.52]So there you go.
[251:28.18]Weirdly enough, the mini golf course was fourth or fifth place.
[251:33.71]People thought the Ludwig Bluff was way better.
[251:37.07]And just like the good, there's also the bad.
[251:39.29]I don't remember these nominees, but they were way more than best.
[251:48.19]I think they were, we had to narrow it down because I think they were like, oh wow, cool, Jeremy, you got like seven nominees for best gamer moment and 70 for worst gamer moment.
[251:58.28]So we really had to narrow this down.
[252:00.58]Honestly, I don't even know what's on this list.
[252:02.54]I haven't seen it.
[252:03.86]I just knew we did a few passes on it because we had to.
[252:07.86]So here are your nominees for just like best gamer moment, here is the worst gamer moment of the entire year.
[252:13.98]Worst gamer moment.
[252:20.15]This is a nine minute category, by the way, so strap in.
[252:23.21]Hand fire tornado.
[252:24.95]Jesus.
[252:26.05]Give fire to the tornado.
[252:30.60]Bro, there ain't no tornado on the screen.
[252:33.56]Hand the fire to the tornado.
[252:36.72]But do it quietly.
[252:38.57]Orc Minecraft fire.
[252:41.39]Me... Me build dirt house and burn it.
[252:45.87]Is... You ten... If... None of these work.
[252:51.35]Eftensib... Eftensib... Ecten... Eltens... Elt... Elten... What is this word, man?
[253:03.78]What is this word?
[253:06.46]Contestant number two, please stop.
[253:08.64]Extensible?
[253:10.32]Extensive background?
[253:12.14]Shit, there's a flag right there.
[253:18.17]What is it?
[253:19.67]Oh my god!
[253:22.61]It's Switzerland!
[253:26.03]What?
[253:34.84]Excuse me?
[253:36.57]Why is this thing coming alive?
[253:40.54]Stone talus?
[253:44.57]I'm fucking dead.
[254:00.71]It's going to do a lot of damage.
[254:02.37]Yeah, it's going to be a lot.
[254:03.23]I mean, we can try.
[254:04.61]Might as well, right?
[254:05.93]Yeah, you can back out whenever it's looking well.
[254:12.94]What the fuck are you talking about?
[254:15.72]Was I not supposed to do that?
[254:16.72]On my screen, you're holding onto nothing.
[254:18.44]You're just floating.
[254:42.49]How long am I supposed to hold this for?
[254:44.39]Uh, a while.
[254:46.29]Um... Um, I'm gonna run out of gear.
[254:48.47]I'm gonna run out of grip.
[254:50.39]I'm gonna run out of grip.
[254:52.47]Hold on, hold on.
[254:55.71]Oh!
[254:56.91]What?
[254:59.87]Shit.
[255:01.65]Uh... Uh...
[255:11.67]Alright seven minutes including chest I'm gonna put my headphones in and just shut the fuck up and do it as best as I can 30 seconds
[255:40.08]I just ran back to the entrance.
[255:51.43]Time.
[255:52.47]Oh, that's what ruined everything.
[255:53.55]6.56.
[255:54.69]19.
[255:56.13]That would have been it.
[255:58.67]Oh, no.
[255:59.95]Time.
[256:00.37]That was it.
[256:01.35]Yeah.
[256:01.85]Nine seconds, right?
[256:06.15]Yeah.
[256:06.77]Go look in here.
[256:07.49]There's a fucking clock in here.
[256:09.11]Oh, my God.
[256:17.89]You can lower the... I'm getting Luigi'd.
[256:19.87]Alright, I'm getting Luigi'd.
[256:22.20]I'm gonna need these later.
[256:23.18]I'm taking them with me.
[256:23.82]I'm taking all these with me.
[256:37.56]Don't.
[256:38.64]Don't.
[256:39.98]What the f...
[256:44.73]Can I have one?
[256:46.11]Can I please have one?
[256:47.09]Why did it let go?
[256:47.99]Nice.
[257:00.28]There's one other, at least one other player for sure.
[257:19.16]Guys, how do I land?
[257:22.34]What?
[257:26.22]Dude, you're kicking butt right now, dude.
[257:29.41]I can't even.
[257:40.79]Game's fucking easy.
[257:48.22]Do not flip the car under any circumstance.
[257:51.62]Don't do it.
[257:52.86]It's not funny.
[257:53.88]It's not a joke.
[257:55.98]It would be annoying because you just wasted like 35 straight minutes cutting wood.
[258:01.16]Jeremy, I know you think you're quite the comedian, but this is not the time to do that.
[258:07.91]Let's go.
[258:12.81]And a lot of people are going to think that that was on purpose, but it was not.
[258:16.63]Like a utility.
[258:26.98]We're good.
[258:28.44]We're good.
[258:28.70]We're good.
[258:28.92]We're good.
[258:30.49]We're good.
[258:30.79]We're good.
[258:31.45]We're good.
[258:31.83]We're good.
[258:33.69]Big points on the board right now.
[258:35.07]Big points.
[258:37.09]We have a replay preview.
[258:41.97]They got beam, they got beam.
[258:43.73]I need res, I need res.
[258:44.59]Oh guys, we need to get to the fucking, we need to get in the car and get the fuck out.
[258:47.63]I need res, I need res.
[258:49.21]I don't last hit.
[258:50.13]Double res, double res.
[258:52.72]He's not a gamer.
[258:53.62]He's coming around, getting shot at.
[258:56.02]Is there a way to get out of here?
[258:57.34]I guess we just run.
[259:02.88]I don't know what the person is!
[259:04.92]I don't know what the person is!
[259:35.88]Wow.
[259:37.26]Jesus.
[259:38.32]Whoa.
[259:39.12]Really?
[259:40.10]Whoa, dude.
[259:40.52]That was bad.
[259:41.58]I have to leave now.
[259:43.10]That was awful.
[259:44.10]I can't... I didn't get anything.
[259:51.85]We're in trouble.
[259:52.67]How do I solve this?
[259:53.27]Someone said half of these are from Breath of the Wild.
[259:55.53]Is there anything I can eat that takes me to the last bonfire?
[259:57.68]How do I fix this?
[259:59.06]Into the forest?
[260:01.22]I'm so sorry.
[260:03.20]Oh, shit.
[260:06.06]Oh, this is bad.
[260:07.34]This is bad.
[260:08.26]This is bad.
[260:09.28]This is bad.
[260:09.88]This is bad.
[260:10.44]This is bad.
[260:11.30]This is bad.
[260:12.96]Um, I think we're in trouble.
[260:14.93]I think we're in trouble.
[260:24.15]See here?
[260:24.61]Keep your eyes on the lady.
[260:27.51]Where is she gonna go?
[260:28.47]Where is she gonna go?
[260:36.40]I got it.
[260:37.68]It was easy.
[260:41.07]Oh, but oh, don't be feeling too bad.
[260:42.43]Ain't nobody can... What?
[260:43.87]Wait, what happened?
[260:44.89]Was I not even looking?
[260:46.01]Hey, let's do the rest of this with my fucking eyes closed.
[260:53.46]Don't make a joke.
[260:54.30]Stop.
[261:01.63]Why did I do that?
[261:04.10]Why did I do that?
[261:04.64]I was going to make like a joke where I was going to close my eyes and cast this card.
[261:06.98]This hurt so bad.
[261:07.82]It really did.
[261:08.16]What the fuck are you doing?
[261:09.08]This was so painful.
[261:09.98]What am I doing?
[261:11.72]Why would I do that?
[261:12.82]Internally.
[261:13.29]I was so internally mad at myself.
[261:14.75]What do you have?
[261:15.17]Index?
[261:15.33]I swear to God.
[261:17.64]Kill him.
[261:17.88]Kill him.
[261:18.38]Kill him.
[261:18.62]I can't do it.
[261:19.02]Kill him.
[261:19.30]I don't know how to do it.
[261:20.42]Kill him.
[261:20.78]I don't know how to do it.
[261:23.18]Kill him.
[261:23.78]How do you do it?
[261:25.12]Kill him.
[261:26.02]I don't know how to do it.
[261:29.78]What?
[261:30.25]What are you doing?
[261:33.55]A lot of good ones.
[261:44.69]But there can only be one winner.
[261:48.11]I'm trying to peek, let's see.
[261:51.75]I can't see through the envelope.
[261:56.19]Your winner for worst gamer moment of the whole year.
[262:04.80]Actually surprising.
[262:07.58]24.4% of the vote.
[262:11.34]Kill him, kill him, I don't know how to do it.
[262:15.14]From Among Us VR.
[262:19.06]And then at 11%, we're going way down.
[262:24.25]11.7%, Margit is one hit away.
[262:26.65]Let's do the rest of this with my eyes closed.
[262:30.53]And then trying to land in Fortnite at 9%.
[262:34.81]Apparently that first one was so bad.
[262:36.27]I don't play Among Us.
[262:38.97]I don't play it.
[262:39.81]How was I supposed to know that?
[262:41.28]That's not a worst gamer moment.
[262:43.58]That is a, I didn't do the tutorial moment.
[262:47.65]because I wanted to get in and hang out with my friends and play video games.
[262:50.63]Is it a fucking crime?
[262:54.53]Oh boy.
[263:01.32]This is a big one.
[263:03.16]Coming up next, this is number 24 in the night.
[263:07.02]This is the worst overall stream of the whole year.
[263:11.12]Or worst stream segment.
[263:14.86]What do you think the worst stream this year was?
[263:19.18]I have few guesses.
[263:19.86]I don't know.
[263:24.72]Let me, before you show the nominees.
[263:28.70]Ooh, that's toasty.
[263:31.30]Every stream, I try to have it be fun.
[263:34.76]I try to have a good time, an idea that maybe, oh, this is a new idea, maybe this is an old idea.
[263:41.58]Every stream I want to be fun, right?
[263:44.44]That's the whole goal.
[263:45.70]As a streamer, you want the streams to be good.
[263:49.00]but sometimes you miss the mark.
[263:51.46]And we're about to find out how badly that mark was missed.
[263:57.71]Ladies and gentlemen, for 2022, here are your nominees for worst stream or stream segment of the entire year.
[264:16.50]Nice.
[264:16.88]There's one other, at least one other player for sure.
[264:23.28]This is pretty bad.
[264:24.08]Alright, whatever.
[264:25.48]I don't play Fortnite.
[264:26.46]I don't play this game.
[264:28.76]I just want to hang out with some cool friends, streamer friends, right?
[264:31.65]Like, what the fuck?
[264:33.21]Is that so bad?
[264:35.77]Guys, how do I land?
[264:38.57]I have, what's it called?
[264:39.71]Splash.
[264:40.25]I could throw it at everyone.
[264:41.29]I've got six minis.
[264:43.82]Run!
[264:44.90]I'm sorry, I don't know how to skip this round.
[264:46.52]I don't know why I went in the dumpster.
[264:48.06]Okay, for all you worst stream ever Andes, alright?
[264:52.89]I'm not going to address it anymore.
[264:56.01]I'm not going to address it anymore.
[264:58.03]I'm just telling you.
[265:00.59]You need to respect me for a minute.
[265:03.96]This sucks.
[265:04.72]That's how you know.
[265:05.86]Excuse me.
[265:06.72]What do you mean?
[265:08.54]Excuse me.
[265:09.10]This was picked in pre-stream chat.
[265:10.94]This was a prank?
[265:11.92]No, this is not a prank.
[265:14.06]In the pre-stream, people were like, yo, dude, Glover Pog.
[265:18.37]How much?
[265:18.89]I'm looking at the chat.
[265:19.75]The hacker wanted me to play this, by the way, which I don't know about that.
[265:23.72]This is PogChamp game.
[265:26.04]Dude, you fell off.
[265:28.20]You can't fall off in 20 minutes.
[265:30.74]You can't fall off in 20 minutes.
[265:32.72]Okay?
[265:33.58]You can't fall off.
[265:34.60]I didn't fall off.
[265:35.39]It's been 15 minutes.
[265:36.67]You don't fall off in 15 minutes.
[265:38.01]Okay, 20%.
[265:38.25]90%.
[265:38.97]Is Buster already made?
[265:49.91]What am I doing wrong?
[265:52.91]It's 20% and 80% or 10% and 90%, right?
[266:01.47]Settle down.
[266:01.85]It's fine.
[266:02.45]Dude, this is genuinely worse than the clock.
[266:05.53]What?
[266:08.08]How is this worse than the clock?
[266:09.28]I'm doing what it says I'm supposed to be doing.
[266:11.66]If you can get it to work, it's definitely a lot better.
[266:16.14]The person was standing still and I couldn't even kill him.
[266:19.69]I'm so bad at this game.
[266:24.50]That's me!
[266:25.28]That's me!
[266:26.46]That's you?
[266:27.68]Oh, I thought that was a bad guy.
[266:37.71]We're good.
[266:37.97]We're good.
[266:38.21]We're good.
[266:39.65]We're good.
[266:39.93]We're good.
[266:40.15]We're good.
[266:40.87]Bye-bye.
[266:41.91]See you guys later.
[266:48.40]I was about to frag her!
[266:51.08]Tell him you're the sus guy.
[266:58.01]This one is so bad.
[266:59.79]This is streamer's choice.
[267:00.75]This wins for me.
[267:01.25]I'm about to veto this.
[267:04.23]All gone.
[267:04.98]I think I have to veto this whole thing.
[267:14.25]But in the meantime, if there's any more You Laugh, You Lose compilations, I'd love to watch them.
[267:19.95]Maybe we can get them vetted quickly or something.
[267:22.39]But I ain't watching.
[267:23.85]I'm done after this.
[267:24.65]This is fucking what a shit idea.
[267:26.13]This is one of the worst ideas I've ever had.
[267:28.15]Figure out the Disney lyrics.
[267:30.45]Ooh.
[267:31.71]Up on that beach.
[267:36.07]Up on that shore.
[267:39.49]Up on that many...
[267:44.79]People galore makes you kind of think I can go the distance.
[267:51.57]This was good.
[267:52.11]I'll be there someday.
[267:54.27]If I can be strong, I know every mile will be worth my while.
[268:05.48]It's I figured it out.
[268:06.80]Any of the bosses that have like the...
[268:15.02]Ludwig has it.
[268:15.84]Godrick has it.
[268:16.54]Ibritas has it.
[268:17.38]They all have it.
[268:18.20]Bro, that looked like battled chess.
[268:31.37]This stream was so bad.
[268:32.59]Somebody just said... It was.
[268:34.98]It was fucking terrible.
[268:36.10]Oh, my God.
[268:36.76]You just ruined Dark Souls 2 for me forever.
[268:38.50]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[268:41.84]No.
[268:47.14]Yes.
[268:49.00]Yes.
[268:50.92]Yes.
[268:57.54]Funny story about the Dark Souls FromSoftware tier list.
[269:02.52]And I'm gonna be honest.
[269:04.32]I got halfway through that list and internally wanted to stop.
[269:09.53]But you can't.
[269:11.61]It was like another three hours.
[269:12.93]It was like a four and a half hour stream.
[269:16.14]I remember getting halfway through, scrolling down, and just going, there's like a hundred bosses I still haven't raided yet.
[269:25.06]Internally, I wanted to turn the stream off, but I didn't.
[269:28.09]I powered through, and it was a mistake.
[269:31.63]Could've just played, could've just played like Picross, and people would've been happy.
[269:39.53]Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the worst stream of the whole year,
[269:57.12]It was close.
[270:00.08]It was close.
[270:03.38]With 27.6% of the vote.
[270:04.06]Number one.
[270:04.84]And then 26.2, all these votes count, by the way.
[270:09.90]Oh, I'm not gonna vote because I don't think it counts.
[270:12.00]27.6 and one, 26.2 and two.
[270:13.47]Number one, the Fortnite tournament.
[270:26.53]I think I was alive for four minutes and the stream was like three hours long.
[270:32.47]And then baby sensory videos right behind it at 26.2.
[270:36.13]That was a bad, I thought that was so funny when we first talked about it.
[270:41.68]Oh, dude, what a fun idea.
[270:42.88]I'll do baby sensory videos.
[270:46.36]I don't know, they're scary.
[270:48.34]If you've seen one, they're terrifying.
[270:51.40]It wasn't even funny, it was just,
[270:54.22]It was just odd.
[270:55.02]It's just odd.
[270:58.53]You know, okay, those of you streamers out there, if you're watching, you know when you get that moment when you're doing something and you just go, fuck, this is bad, and I don't know what to do.
[271:11.49]I don't know how to get out of this.
[271:12.41]How do I get out of this?
[271:13.07]How do I get out of this?
[271:13.93]There has to be a way I can get out of this.
[271:16.62]and there isn't, and you have to sleep in the bed that you made.
[271:20.24]That was the baby sensory, because I hyped that up for a week or two.
[271:24.72]Oh, we're going to do baby sensory videos.
[271:27.03]It's going to be crazy.
[271:27.91]Wow, we're going to talk about them.
[271:29.55]And after one or two, I wanted to turn the stream off so bad.
[271:35.55]And I was like, I just want to go.
[271:36.44]I want to take a bath.
[271:37.18]I just want to get out of here.
[271:38.56]But you can't.
[271:41.34]Number three, by the way, was at 15%.
[271:45.13]Mythbusters, the game.
[271:46.91]Yeah, it wasn't very good.
[271:49.85]These are your worst dreams of the year.
[271:51.37]I don't play, I don't play video games.
[271:53.37]I'm not a video gamer.
[271:55.25]I am, though, because Elden Ring, I beat Elden Ring, I beat Dark Souls 3, I beat Dark Souls Remastered.
[271:59.63]How can you not say that?
[272:01.07]I just, I don't play certain types of games.
[272:03.17]I don't play Fortnite.
[272:04.09]I don't play Call of Duty.
[272:06.59]Who cares, right?
[272:07.95]Whatever, you know what?
[272:09.72]Let's go check in with the elves.
[272:13.85]Follow me.
[272:17.23]Hold that door for you.
[272:27.90]Elves, I'm coming to say hello.
[272:31.16]There's some noise in here.
[272:35.08]I think we can start reselling after our two tickets.
[272:37.91]I think they're going to take off.
[272:39.83]No, no, no, no.
[272:40.23]What about the elves?
[272:40.87]Hello.
[272:41.43]We're going to take off.
[272:43.78]What are you doing?
[272:44.56]Investing.
[272:45.79]We're investing in the money game.
[272:47.07]Brainstorming.
[272:48.59]That you promised us.
[272:50.60]What do you got here?
[272:51.48]How do you feel about investing in N-Elf Tees?
[272:53.29]N-Elf Tees, they're gonna take off.
[272:54.73]N-Elf Tees.
[272:56.09]Not what you're thinking, but they're actually elf T-shirts.
[272:59.81]Yeah.
[273:00.15]That's cool, we have other ideas.
[273:02.95]Yeah, we got more.
[273:03.69]Gingerbread.
[273:04.77]Robots to build puzzles.
[273:06.36]Yes.
[273:06.72]You need that considering you haven't done a goddamn thing.
[273:09.54]But wait a minute.
[273:10.52]We're close.
[273:11.02]I feel a little disrespectful.
[273:13.58]Clearly there's some stuff happening.
[273:16.52]You've done a border of one of them.
[273:18.75]Oh, she has.
[273:20.51]Puzzle girl!
[273:21.67]Puzzle girl!
[273:23.05]Puzzle girl!
[273:24.25]Puzzle girl!
[273:25.31]Puzzle girl!
[273:26.73]Puzzle girl!
[273:27.95]Puzzle girl!
[273:29.35]You wanted to stop.
[273:30.29]I was doing it still.
[273:31.07]That's good.
[273:35.13]Oops.
[273:37.07]I got a better idea.
[273:37.71]How about this?
[273:41.75]Why do I hear Smash Brothers?
[273:44.53]Activities?
[273:45.07]We were also playing games.
[273:46.89]You're playing games?
[273:48.15]Alright.
[273:48.59]I tried to hide it.
[273:49.59]You play games.
[273:51.03]I'll give that a sick.
[273:52.85]Oh, thanks.
[273:54.89]Hey, what are these?
[274:01.65]Hey, these are $1,000 chips.
[274:02.73]These are $1,000 bucks.
[274:03.43]None of, nobody's getting these.
[274:08.95]Hey, elves.
[274:10.06]What?
[274:10.56]Yeah?
[274:11.00]Do you think it should be snowing in here?
[274:12.92]Yeah.
[274:14.52]Yeah.
[274:14.98]Yeah.
[274:15.30]I love snow.
[274:16.50]We're doing puzzles.
[274:17.78]Hey, chat.
[274:18.42]Should it start snowing in here yet, do you think?
[274:22.25]I want to make sure I see it first.
[274:25.34]Should it start snowing for real this time?
[274:30.36]Do it for Puzzle Girl.
[274:31.30]Snow!
[274:32.86]Snow!
[274:33.04]Snow!
[274:34.40]Snow!
[274:35.18]Snow!
[274:35.28]Snow!
[274:44.17]Let's go!
[275:03.02]They were bored in here.
[275:04.64]This was all worth it!
[275:08.09]Okay.
[275:11.23]What is this?
[275:13.33]Whoa!
[275:16.01]A present?
[275:18.03]You know, all my presents got deleted.
[275:19.65]You know that, right?
[275:20.39]It's gonna be okay!
[275:21.87]It's gonna be okay!
[275:25.83]Who is this from?
[275:26.39]From all of us.
[275:27.93]From all the elves?
[275:28.69]The elves.
[275:29.89]Good luck doing the puzzle, by the way, because it's literally impossible.
[275:33.64]OK, from the elves.
[275:39.26]What is it?
[275:39.66]Maybe it's an egg.
[275:40.85]Could it be an Xbox?
[275:45.63]What is this?
[275:46.57]That's the bin we put the puzzle in.
[276:00.02]Hey, give it up for the elves, can we please?
[276:10.89]Why did I do that?
[276:15.31]It's like being at the lunch table.
[276:24.79]Hey, dude, eat the meatball covered in, like, gravy and all the fuck that... I did that stuff when I was younger.
[276:31.58]Give it up for the elves.
[276:33.46]They did absolutely nothing the whole day.
[276:35.70]That's good.
[276:37.80]Actually, that was an experiment to see if they could actually do anything.
[276:40.80]It's like, oh, let's get 15 elves to be in a room and do something and make a puzzle.
[276:45.64]They didn't even come close.
[276:46.38]They were just drinking the whole night.
[276:47.92]But that's fine.
[276:49.36]That's fine.
[276:50.10]But, I mean, the snow was fun.
[276:52.14]They were fun.
[276:52.70]They were a good group.
[276:55.96]Now they gotta clean all that up.
[276:58.40]I can't believe I put that in my mouth.
[277:00.70]More puzzle, pog, pog, more puzzle.
[277:03.44]The mic is fucked up.
[277:04.58]Did I fuck the mic up?
[277:06.74]Did I ruin the mic?
[277:09.58]Mic, oh no.
[277:10.49]Alright, we are down to the last three categories of the night.
[277:19.77]It's been a wild night.
[277:22.03]Maybe you've had a few alcoholic beverages.
[277:23.57]Maybe you haven't.
[277:24.93]Maybe you've had some tea.
[277:27.36]but we're getting down to the last three, and these are special.
[277:33.26]This next one is favorite collab appearance.
[277:39.38]I did a lot of other streams this year, going on other people's channels and traveling, and there was a lot of shows that I was on that were not mine.
[277:49.72]So this was fun.
[277:50.86]It was actually really cool to go hang out with other streamers
[277:54.26]This is your favorite collab of the year.
[277:56.80]Whatever that one happened to be.
[277:59.50]So here you go, here are your nominees.
[278:01.36]We only got three more.
[278:02.54]Favorite collab appearance outside of the channel that of you, I can't even talk, of the year.
[278:12.32]The favorite of the, of you, of the, of the.
[278:17.64]Our next contestant is definitely not photoshopped and is very caked up.
[278:22.86]Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for Jerma!
[278:28.32]Actually, I wasn't going to bring this up.
[278:30.30]His podium's bigger than mine.
[278:32.26]I want to replace him.
[278:32.96]Look, it's at least a quarter of an inch higher than mine.
[278:35.70]He's got podium envy.
[278:36.76]Did you not read my rider?
[278:37.94]Let me tell you something, you bastard.
[278:40.05]Let me tell you something.
[278:41.85]My podium might be one or two inches bigger than yours, but that doesn't matter.
[278:44.39]You need to relax and go back to what you were doing.
[278:46.53]Yeah, get back to what you were, Rick, please.
[278:48.07]I haven't seen that, Jerma.
[278:49.23]I haven't seen that.
[278:51.19]Bring that down for him, Will.
[278:53.25]Oh!
[278:53.57]Wow.
[278:53.97]The athleticism.
[278:56.95]Oh, look at that.
[278:57.75]Oh, okay.
[279:00.13]Okay.
[279:01.39]We are not insured for this.
[279:03.09]The winner of Name Your Price between Jerma and Mia is...
[279:17.77]Congratulations!
[279:19.73]This is where it gets very heated because I know you have a two right here somewhere.
[279:26.31]And ladies and gentlemen, we did it.
[279:38.03]There's no fucking way.
[279:39.69]And then, like, you bet, like, a little bit there, and then maybe I'd be like, you know, what's 50 more?
[279:44.42]You know what I mean?
[279:46.84]It's a nominal amount.
[279:48.68]It's a nominal amount.
[279:51.50]What does that mean?
[279:53.48]Oh.
[279:54.86]Jerma.
[279:56.34]You absolute idiot.
[279:58.66]Am I stupid?
[279:59.40]Because I just won the game.
[280:07.16]That's a three of a kind.
[280:09.64]You just got sharked.
[280:11.40]My music's been buffering all day, so I was going to count until it buffered, but then the music didn't buffer this time, so I've just been counting.
[280:19.22]Rock.
[280:20.26]Rock!
[280:20.84]You just got to get the right leverage.
[280:29.84]Oh, my Lord.
[280:31.34]Hercules.
[280:32.40]Wearing costume.
[280:33.48]I'm Mercy from the Overwatch 2.
[280:36.90]And who's that?
[280:38.08]Hey, how are you?
[280:38.92]It's me, Deadpool.
[280:39.90]Nice to see everybody.

[280:41.53]It's so good to have you here.
[280:42.75]Yeah, special guest here.
[280:44.29]You just missed Jerma.
[280:45.49]Did I?
[280:46.07]Yeah, he was a great guy.
[280:47.23]Oh, he's a fun dude.
[280:48.19]He's fun.
[280:48.59]Kind of a weird guy.
[280:49.53]Kind of a weird guy.
[280:50.21]But I just missed him?
[280:51.39]Just missed him.
[280:52.17]Wow.
[280:52.51]So, hey, me at the Merc with a Mouth, let me tell you what I'm going to do today.
[280:55.12]I'm going to take, we're going to make pumpkin pie.
[280:56.92]That's what's going to happen here.
[281:00.92]I've been waiting all week to do this one.
[281:02.36]Alright, get in there.
[281:09.99]I don't think I made it.
[281:11.63]I'm assuming it missed.
[281:12.55]I can't tell.
[281:13.09]Ooh, you know what?
[281:15.03]My lips are jaw right now.
[281:16.19]Oh, are they?
[281:16.69]What?
[281:17.51]What the fuck?
[281:21.28]Did they get that?
[281:22.16]It just cut to Jerma doing exercise actually.
[281:24.58]Wait, what?
[281:25.08]Did they miss that?
[281:25.76]Yeah, it was just Jerma doing this.
[281:27.36]Did they miss that shot?
[281:28.94]I was preparing.
[281:29.44]I was stretching.
[281:30.26]Yeah, and how about you tell us what you have in your pocket earlier?
[281:32.50]Yeah, he's got like a lip balm on a Q-tip.
[281:34.98]You're actually calling me out for this?
[281:36.46]Yeah, pull it out, man.
[281:37.36]I mean, it's not... So, it's... I saw you use it now.
[281:41.86]That is a gab that you smoke weed out of.
[281:44.80]No, this is not drugs.
[281:45.92]It's in a drug baggie, but it doesn't mean it's drugs.
[282:10.61]Got it under control though I'm gonna land this gonna be an S tier pilot by the way and when you all do your reviews I want you to say thanks to the yes to your landing and have a great rest of your evening planning Okay

[282:33.06]Don't worry.
[282:34.22]Oh, my God.
[282:35.74]Jeremiah, if we don't make it out of this one, I just want to let you know, you're a great pilot, okay?
[282:42.90]Thank you so much.
[282:44.10]This may require both of us, alright?
[282:47.90]And by the way, I've got a bag under my bed that has 50 grand in it.
[282:50.85]I just want to make sure somebody knows.

[283:23.96]We got the amazing Jeremiah.
[283:25.77]Everybody clap.
[283:26.97]Oh.
[283:27.97]Hello.
[283:28.55]Oh, my god.
[283:29.01]It's you.
[283:29.59]How are you?
[283:30.13]Oh, Donna.
[283:30.55]It's such a wonderful time to see you.
[283:32.63]Yes.
[283:33.41]Sit here?
[283:34.01]Yeah, you may sit there.
[283:35.09]OK, sit here.
[283:36.32]Now, I hear you put on the biggest production of Guys and Dolls Twitch has ever seen.
[283:41.10]Well, yeah, a bit close.
[283:42.20]Who's this tweet about?
[283:43.16]Alright.
[283:44.69]A reply to Jerma, 985.
[283:47.51]Alright.
[283:48.15]Or is it a reply to super galactic porn star Mia Malkova?
[283:52.14]That fat, juicy ass.
[283:54.18]Fat spelled with a PH.
[283:55.82]PH.
[283:58.28]Which is the good.
[283:59.78]Yeah.
[284:01.00]I'm going to say 2020.
[284:01.96]I'm going to say this is about me.
[284:05.78]Wow.
[284:06.74]Alright.
[284:07.16]What do you think, Donna?
[284:09.78]Am I missing something?
[284:11.42]I'm gonna say me and Malkova.
[284:13.20]I would like to say Jerma is a little full of himself.
[284:18.14]It is me and Malkova.
[284:20.92]I mean, that's all.
[284:23.40]I wanted that tweet of me showing my ass in the mirror.
[284:26.42]What?
[284:27.26]Anyway, let's take a look at some of our competitors.
[284:30.06]Jerma.
[284:32.02]What question did you ask me earlier?
[284:33.50]I asked you what the accelerate button was.
[284:36.94]Who's your teammate?
[284:38.02]You.
[284:39.76]Okay, let's go see how other people are doing.
[284:41.30]Are you sipping it right now?
[284:42.66]No, I just opened it.
[284:44.28]It's harder to chug a cold beer, you know that.
[284:47.05]Yeah, but it tastes better.
[284:48.77]You don't chug for taste.
[284:51.39]Everything is taste.
[284:52.47]Everything.
[284:53.15]You can't just chug.
[284:53.81]What do you mean, taste?
[284:54.49]This is a typical Golden Knights fan.
[284:57.97]They almost won the goddamn Stanley Cup the first year, by the way.
[285:00.75]They did.
[285:01.79]How long ago was that?
[285:02.99]That's not great.
[285:04.11]You don't love that for them.
[285:05.35]I used to do that when it turned out.
[285:08.18]By the way, I don't really like Mario Kart.
[285:10.40]What?
[285:11.18]Why did you accept doing this?
[285:12.92]Because I think you're cool.
[285:15.28]Really?
[285:15.70]Yeah.
[285:16.28]Oh, thank you.
[285:17.12]Statistically, those ones do, actually.
[285:19.82]No, exactly.
[285:22.32]Thinking about fucking toting this next last round.
[285:25.05]You want to fuck Toad?
[285:26.21]Is that what he just... I will say something before I open this, that thanks to all the other streamers that let me kind of participate in their shows, because it's fun, and I hope that you liked it.
[285:49.35]I hope you thought it was fun, me participating in everything.
[285:53.70]I did a lot of stuff this year.
[285:55.60]So there's a lot of people doing really, really cool shit on these platforms.
[285:59.36]So it's an honor to be able to participate and have fun.
[286:03.20]So thank you all these nominees, everybody that's in here.
[286:07.47]It's been a lot of fun.
[286:08.39]It has.
[286:09.67]Thank you.
[286:10.17]I actually do mean that.
[286:10.95]Thank you so much for letting me be part of your cool shit.
[286:14.97]But what was everybody's favorite?
[286:18.40]They're all good.
[286:20.88]What do we got here?
[286:21.70]Who is the favorite collab of the year?
[286:24.48]Ladies and gentlemen, it is... Ooh, close.
[286:29.16]28% of the vote and then two was 25.6.
[286:31.66]Number one was Tommy Time with Critical.
[286:43.00]which was so much fun.
[286:44.70]That whole group is so awesome.
[286:46.63]That was an unbelievable experience.
[286:48.05]Name your price with Austin's show at number two.
[286:52.37]And then bro versus bro, bro versus bro with Ludwig.
[286:55.29]Bro versus bro.
[286:56.89]Ludwig is here.
[286:58.07]So Ludwig, you came in third place on best collab stream.
[287:03.97]I don't know if he's even here anymore.
[287:06.15]But yeah, that...
[287:08.06]That means a lot.
[287:09.02]It means a lot to be able to be a part of other people's shows.
[287:12.09]I hope I made them more fun.
[287:14.27]And if I didn't, then maybe I won't get a call back.
[287:17.61]Alright.
[287:19.47]Alright, don't get sentimental.
[287:20.85]Don't start crying.
[287:22.05]There's a lot of people watching you.
[287:24.55]You probably heard that weird burp.
[287:26.58]We're getting to the last two categories.
[287:28.36]There's only two left.
[287:30.10]There's best overall stream or series and best overall event.
[287:35.02]We can start with this one here.
[287:37.44]It's been kind of a wild year and there's a lot to go over.
[287:41.84]So I guess I don't need to introduce this too much.
[287:46.39]This is the nominees for the best stream or stream series of the year.
[287:51.63]And here they are.
[288:01.26]You guys are losing your fucking minds.

[293:50.81]That fucking face squat, goddammit.
[293:53.09]Excuse me?
[294:07.90]Whoa!
[294:09.14]What's happening?
[294:10.74]Somebody's stabbing me.
[294:11.64]What?
[294:12.38]What happened?
[294:12.98]Dude, this is illegal.
[294:16.00]That's illegal.
[294:20.67]Oh my god.
[294:21.69]Okay, hurry up.
[294:25.05]Hurry, hurry.
[294:29.57]I just shit my pants.
[294:31.37]What?
[294:32.21]My popularity is dwindling.
[294:33.73]Please get... What?
[294:34.77]How am I supposed to do anything when everybody just attacks me?
[294:38.38]What the fuck are you... Where'd he go?
[294:42.36]I missed.
[294:46.28]This was so fun.
[294:50.75]I'm just a psycho.
[294:52.31]I'm sorry.
[294:53.25]No, I don't mean... I don't... Alright, you can arrest me.
[294:57.34]I don't know.
[294:58.00]This is weird.
[294:58.64]Everybody looking at me.
[294:59.80]Don't look at me.
[295:03.78]What the fuck?
[295:04.64]That's like a monster.
[295:08.98]I'm trying to snap his neck.
[295:16.79]Strangle him.
[295:17.77]I'm trying to strangle him.
[295:22.41]Hey, give me that gun, motherfucker.
[295:24.05]This is the back of this.
[295:28.47]Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
[295:30.58]Holy shit, that was like the worst thing that ever happened to me.
[295:33.26]You just stole Austin Powers' mojo.
[295:36.64]Jesus.
[295:38.16]Give me a fucking brick.
[295:47.28]That was fucked up.
[295:48.66]That was actually pretty fun.
[296:00.34]I'm sorry I can't do it what is what is we have one minute and 15 seconds to go this way so we gotta go up where did you go we're going up get off the barrel get off the barrel that was awful
[296:30.00]Yeah.
[296:33.74]I'm loving it.
[296:34.86]I don't like this.
[296:35.64]I hate this.
[296:39.14]Oh!
[296:39.84]Holy shit.
[296:40.64]People are so ugly with light, aren't they?
[296:43.35]Holy shit.
[296:43.85]People are so ugly.
[296:45.19]Look at... Alright.
[296:46.87]Oh, Jerma, you look real handsome today.
[296:48.33]You sure about that?
[296:52.75]Oh!
[296:56.31]Oh, no, he killed that guy.
[296:57.70]What?
[296:58.82]Oh, my God.
[297:00.04]I am so confused right now.
[297:05.46]There you go.
[297:06.64]I told you it was real.
[297:08.72]Hey, let's do the rest of this with my fucking eyes closed.
[297:10.52]Don't make a joke.
[297:11.36]Stop.
[297:17.88]Oh, my God.
[297:18.44]What am I doing?
[297:19.20]If I chop you up in a meat grinder, and the only thing that comes out that's left of you is your eyeball, you're
[297:27.78]So those are your nominees for Best Stream or Stream Series of the Year.
[297:58.12]I feel like there are a lot of good ones.
[297:59.10]I feel like there was a lot of fun this year.
[298:01.76]I say that every year, but I do mean it.
[298:03.56]And let's see.
[298:05.60]I'm gonna start crying on camera, right?
[298:08.08]I'm gonna start, I'm gonna cry.
[298:09.50]It's gonna happen.
[298:10.77]Just wait.
[298:11.11]Alright, ladies and gentlemen, the, what you have decided was the best stream or stream series of the year.
[298:22.13]Oh, the misery, no.
[298:24.20]Elden Ring at 27.2%.
[298:27.01]And let me tell you, it makes sense considering I streamed that game for almost two straight months.
[298:33.83]There was a high chance it was going to be Elden Ring because it was a third of every stream I did this year.
[298:40.05]And also Game of the Year, by the way.
[298:43.09]Elden Ring at 27.2%.
[298:45.26]Underneath that is infomercial React Andy.
[298:49.98]Going to have to do more of those React Andy streams because...
[298:54.70]Okay.
[298:55.70]And then Breath of, I didn't even beat Breath of the Wild yet, but Breath of the Wild number three.
[299:00.90]By the way, this is second most least skipped category.
[299:04.08]So people wanted to vote for this.
[299:06.30]But Elden Ring, obviously Elden Ring swept everything, swept the Game Awards, swept my awards, right?
[299:11.24]So obviously it's gonna win.
[299:13.81]And it was so fun.
[299:14.89]Those are some of the, honestly, those are some of the funnest streams I had, I think ever on the channel.
[299:22.07]That game just had so many fun moments.
[299:25.76]Once in a generation, you get it.
[299:28.22]Alright.
[299:30.36]Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.
[299:32.68]We are approaching the final category, which is a small category, but it's fun to do.
[299:39.03]The last category of the evening is best overall stream event.
[299:44.69]There was only about four or five this year.
[299:48.49]I love doing events.
[299:49.49]I think they're fun.
[299:50.94]Get people together, have a good time.
[299:53.33]This is an event.
[299:55.11]Can't vote for this though, but hey, maybe you can next year.
[299:58.35]Hey, maybe jot it down for, you know, best event of the year, the Jerma985 holiday Christmas stream.
[300:05.40]But yeah, this is gonna be it.
[300:06.54]This is the last category of the evening, is what you thought the best stream of the year was that was a event stream.
[300:13.70]We did non-event, here is event.
[300:16.16]Here are your nominees.
[300:22.63]Most least.
[300:26.34]So what I've decided to do is, over the last few months, we've scoured the country trying to find who I think could potentially be able to replace me.
[300:39.20]And a little bit of Ashby.
[300:41.14]Alright.
[300:42.59]Gray.
[300:44.61]And another one here.
[300:46.62]Alright.
[300:47.80]Then we got a little.
[300:49.20]Might be a little too much.
[300:50.38]Oh, a little bit, a little bit too much.
[300:51.58]I'll pull back on the speed.
[300:52.98]Pull back on the speed.
[300:54.04]Alright, you got it.
[300:54.80]Everybody had three jokes.
[300:57.19]We're rats.
[301:00.75]We're rats.
[301:03.65]We pray at night.
[301:06.21]We stalk at night.
[301:09.15]We're rats.
[301:12.49]You think you can beat me?
[301:13.41]I know I can beat you.
[301:14.19]I don't know what I'm gonna beat you at.
[301:15.53]Oh, you know you can beat me.
[301:16.50]Go ahead and cue the music.
[301:18.26]Good luck.
[301:19.80]Weird Monopoly, man.
[301:23.47]Swedish Monopoly, man.
[301:30.74]What is planned?
[301:31.56]Do you guys secretize this?
[301:33.16]Ster, I've been here for 10 years.
[301:34.58]We've, I, TF2 and... Look at me.
[301:37.70]Look at me.
[301:38.14]That's me.
[301:39.10]I just want you to know.
[301:40.02]You can Google all that.
[301:41.14]He knows nothing.
[301:41.82]I could tell who it was the whole time.
[301:43.84]What?
[301:46.88]Oh!
[301:47.92]You shot.
[301:49.16]Good job.
[301:50.28]You shot him.
[301:51.92]You just gotta, you just gotta... Hey, everybody.
[301:53.70]What's going on?
[301:54.18]It's me, the sus guy.
[301:55.42]I've been muted this whole time.
[301:58.67]It's these two!
[302:00.89]It's definitely these two!
[302:01.77]It's these two!
[302:02.17]It's definitely these two!
[302:03.75]It's these two!
[302:04.09]No!
[302:04.17]It's these two!
[302:04.95]It's these two!
[302:05.53]Help!
[302:05.69]What do you have, an index?
[302:30.15]Kill him!
[302:30.37]Kill him!
[302:30.87]Kill him!
[302:31.11]I can't do it!
[302:31.51]Kill him!
[302:31.79]I don't know how to do it!
[302:32.43]Kill him!
[302:32.73]I don't know how to do it!
[302:33.62]Kill him!
[302:34.26]How do you do it?
[302:35.48]Dude, kill him!
[302:36.10]I don't know how to do it!
[302:38.82]What?
[302:39.04]What are you doing?
[302:41.00]What?
[302:41.72]What?
[302:42.08]I agree.
[302:43.46]Get this guy out of here.
[302:44.24]Get this guy out of here.
[302:45.04]Get this guy out of here.
[302:45.85]How do we get this guy out of here?
[302:47.07]I turned around.
[302:48.89]Criken jump scared me.
[302:49.73]No one's listening.
[302:56.42]Okay.
[302:56.80]I should probably be on this camera right now.
[302:59.52]He should be looking directly at you.
[303:01.88]Okay.
[303:02.46]Alright.
[303:02.78]Okay.
[303:03.14]Okay.
[303:03.30]It's my birthday!
[303:03.92]Everyone quiet.
[303:05.34]Happy birthday.
[303:07.66]So... By the way, can I just say... I should be on the wide camera for this one.
[303:12.20]No!
[303:12.44]This is... No!
[303:13.02]We have 47 seconds!
[303:13.62]There's only 40 seconds!
[303:18.97]Welcome to Car Shield Field where we have Jerma Baseball Association action for you tonight.
[303:26.33]A big time matchup between the California Circus and the Maryland Magicians.
[303:31.81]You like that call from Elbertson behind home plate.
[303:34.97]Sometimes you're not sure where the pitch missed.
[303:36.89]Elbertson always lets you know.
[303:40.90]Make magic slowly.
[303:42.04]Oh!
[303:43.52]What a play!
[303:45.03]Oh, we got our first pie in the face.
[303:47.09]Elbertson, pie in the face.
[303:49.95]Elbertson.
[303:51.69]The circus wanted that play called dead because... Oh, and he is tossed.
[303:56.75]Is this... We've got a streaker.
[304:00.73]We've got a streaker, ladies and gentlemen.
[304:03.19]Before the JBA, the math may be a little bit off.
[304:06.02]Look!
[304:06.34]Look at this.
[304:06.74]He's pulled it down the line.
[304:07.98]It's fair.
[304:09.08]Elbertson speeding past first.
[304:11.40]He's thinking two.
[304:12.88]Throw comes in the second.
[304:14.40]Oh, he takes a quick turnaround and a good decision by crew chief Elbertson.
[304:19.60]He rules himself safe at first.
[304:22.12]And that one's in for the call strike.
[304:24.56]Oh, two.
[304:24.96]And oh my goodness.
[304:26.06]Everyone clearing the dugout for the magicians.
[304:30.21]Oh my goodness.
[304:30.91]This is bad.
[304:32.29]Feed him to the lions.
[304:35.20]Yeah, feed him.
[304:36.56]Feed him to the lions, don't you think?
[304:38.00]But you know what's not byahu?
[304:42.58]And what's not cool?
[304:44.52]Drugs and alcohol.
[304:45.54]Hello again, Steve.
[304:50.36]Let's go.
[304:50.78]You can see my dick.
[304:53.46]You can see my dick if you want to see it.
[304:55.84]Freeze it.
[304:58.60]Is that him?
[305:01.95]Yeah, yeah, it has to be.
[305:14.59]Goddamn.
[305:28.04]Oh, man.
[305:31.84]You guys are unbelievably funny.
[305:33.24]Alright.
[305:36.87]Let's get it.
[305:37.87]The winner of best event of the year.
[305:40.27]There's only about four or five of them, so let's see, it's gonna be close.
[305:44.40]It's not close.
[305:45.96]It's not close at all.
[305:48.58]42.7% of the vote is the Jerma Baseball Association.
[305:53.67]And then the Sus guy finally plays Among Us.
[305:57.45]Above Who Will Replace Me, which the Sus guy was 24.5%, and Who Will Replace Me at 19.4.
[306:07.60]This was also the least skipped category of the year.
[306:10.70]People wanted to vote for this.
[306:12.80]And that's it.
[306:14.58]So I am going to say goodnight.
[306:18.20]Thanks everybody for watching.
[306:20.28]It's been an unbelievable experience.
[306:22.24]Before we go, before we go, I gotta thank a lot of people.

[306:38.58]A lot of time and a lot of work and a lot of energy went into this.
[306:41.60]I know people didn't expect, oh, wow, you didn't do your award show.
[306:44.40]Whatever.
[306:44.80]Okay, cool.
[306:45.62]Like you do every year.
[306:47.21]A lot of people were involved.
[306:48.97]And I do want to say thank you to a very specific few people.
