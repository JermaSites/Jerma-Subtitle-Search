[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.90]Hi, guys.
[00:03.83]How are you?
[00:06.29]Do I even have... Where's my stuff?
[00:10.83]What happened to my stuff?
[00:14.33]Hold on.
[00:14.68]Why is this over here?
[00:15.38]I haven't been here in like 38 hours, not like six weeks.
[00:20.88]Why hasn't my ship moved around?
[00:23.28]Hold on.
[00:49.57]Yeah, that's a little better.
[00:50.35]Where the fuck was I when I moved around?
[00:52.47]I didn't do that.
[00:55.65]Somebody, like, snuck in my room and did it.
[00:59.33]Alright.
[01:00.55]So, hello there.
[01:02.51]Tonight we're gonna play Mount and Blade Warband.
[01:04.85]Uh, I have an incredibly highly requested game.
[01:12.89]That, um, I've... It took me, like, a year to get it on the screen.
[01:20.38]It was a very, very tough battle between Mountain Blade and I Spy Children's Haunted Mansion Kids Children's Game thing.
[01:34.82]And Desert Buzz.
[01:42.67]Let me get a sip of that coffee.
[01:44.83]And I'll be live in about two... I am live.
[01:46.77]I'll be here in about 15 seconds.
[01:48.59]Hold on.
[02:20.10]Okay, sorry.
[02:20.66]I have two pieces of music playing in my ear at the same time, and it's jamming me.
[02:28.05]I have the Mountain Blade Star Wars music going on.
[02:31.45]And then also this.
[02:32.23]This is what I'm... There, ready?
[02:37.11]Alright!
[02:41.25]Let me get that over here.
[02:42.23]Alright, let's go.
[02:43.65]Mountain Blade Warband.
[02:47.70]I have no idea how this game plays.
[02:49.50]I was told it was kind of like Kenshi.
[02:52.78]You wandered the wasteland.
[02:55.08]Or something like that.
[03:01.61]Let me go over here.
[03:04.17]And now you should be able to see it.
[03:08.63]It's kind of like Kenshi, but with a thousand people.
[03:12.47]Oh god.
[03:15.72]Okay, well this is going to be interesting.
[03:20.25]Alright.
[03:21.89]Should I... I gotta play the tutorial, right?
[03:23.37]I have no idea what's going on.
[03:28.53]You approach a field where the locals are training with weapons.
[03:30.87]You can practice here to improve your combat skills.
[03:36.98]Okay, we're just here.
[03:38.40]Walk around the training field and speak with the fighters to practice various actors of mountain blade combat.
[03:42.21]You can use ASD... Come on, that's WASD, not ASD.
[03:46.73]Move around to talk to a character, approach him until his name appears on your screen, and then press the F key.
[03:51.45]You can also use the F key to pick up items, open doors, and interact with objects.
[03:56.93]Press tab to exit the tutorial at any time.
[03:58.55]Okay, so walk and then... Is there a sprint?
[04:02.61]Okay, so practice on this guy's head.
[04:05.75]I'm a novice fighter.
[04:08.21]Hello there, we're polishing off our combat skills with a bit of sparring practice.
[04:10.69]You look like you'd use a bit of training.
[04:12.73]Why don't you join us and we can show you a few tricks.
[04:15.97]And if you need an explanation of any combat concepts, just ask and I will do my best to fill you in.
[04:24.24]Let's attack.
[04:24.68]Okay, I'm not going to read any of the stuff up there.
[04:28.88]No, no, no.
[04:29.92]Why would I do that?
[04:31.90]I need to know what to do.
[04:33.30]Why would I not read it?
[04:37.08]Alright, there are four principal directions for attacking.
[04:41.36]These are overhead swing, right swing, left swing, shoo, shoo, shoo, hey, hey, hey.
[04:47.62]Now, I'll tell you which direction to attack from, and you must try to do the correct attack.
[04:51.44]Move your mouse while you press the left mouse button to specify attack direction.
[04:57.26]Okay, so it's mouse movement and click.
[05:00.76]Now, for example, to execute an overhead attack, move the mouse up at the instant you press the left mouse button.
[05:06.43]The icons on your screen will help you do the correct action.
[05:10.37]Okay.
[05:12.03]Uh, so he wants me to do what?
[05:13.67]Swing to the left?
[05:15.15]Okay.
[05:16.69]How many more?
[05:17.17]Down?
[05:25.14]Can you move around and do that?
[05:27.94]I guess you can.
[05:31.42]Very good.
[05:33.38]You've learned how to attack from any direction you want.
[05:36.06]If you like, we can try this again and move to a different exercise.
[05:41.64]I would like to practice blocking.
[05:44.24]Unlike a shield, blocking with a weapon can only stop attacks from coming from one direction.
[05:49.33]For example, if you block up, you'll deflect overhead attacks, but you can still be hit by side swings or thrust attacks.
[05:58.76]Bullshit.
[06:00.02]Alright.
[06:00.48]You must press and hold down the right mouse button to block.
[06:05.55]Okay.
[06:06.39]I'll now attack you with different types of strokes, and I will wait until you do the correct block before attacking.
[06:11.22]Try to do the correct block as soon as you can.
[06:14.84]This practice is easy to do with the automatic block direction setting, which is the default.
[06:20.24]Alright, I'm not turning that off.
[06:21.72]If you go to the options menu and change defend direction control to mouse movement or keyboard, you'll need to manually choose block direction.
[06:27.86]This is much more challenging, but makes the game much more interesting.
[06:31.01]This practice can be useful if you use manual blocking.
[06:34.65]I don't care.
[06:37.69]Nah, I ain't ready for that.
[06:43.33]So I'm just going to parry until you hold?
[06:44.57]Hold.
[06:49.31]Yeah, I'm not doing the direct... I can do the direction shoot with the other thing.
[06:51.76]With swinging.
[06:53.78]Not with blocking.
[06:54.46]Does this game suck?
[07:01.73]I'm curious.
[07:07.27]No.
[07:07.89]Okay.
[07:11.10]Good, you're able to block my attack successfully.
[07:12.86]You may repeat this practice and try to get faster each time.
[07:17.93]You're confident in your defense skills.
[07:19.31]Do you want to have another go?
[07:20.19]No, I think I got it.
[07:26.01]Detective Stream Part 2.
[07:29.47]I guess I'm like, okay, let's take a look at this here.
[07:31.09]I was just fucking blue and... You know what?
[07:38.84]I gotta do it.
[07:40.38]I have to do it.
[07:40.90]I have to tell you guys something.
[07:45.48]I have to tell you a stream that's coming up.
[07:46.92]I have to, because I need help with that stream.
[07:50.66]And there's only one way I'm gonna be able to do that.
[07:55.58]And that's with throwing a line out to the community.
[08:00.99]I have to do it.
[08:05.97]So...
[08:09.40]You know what?
[08:10.36]We'll do this in the Discord.
[08:12.16]Later on in the Discord, either today or tomorrow, I'm gonna throw a line out about something to do with robotics.
[08:21.28]Okay?
[08:22.87]If you know about robotics, specifically Twitch-controlled robotics, I may need to ask you a few questions.
[08:34.54]So, uh... I'm gonna throw the line out to the community.
[08:38.78]Because I've been trying to do research, I've been trying to figure it out for months.
[08:42.84]And that's the way we're gonna go with it.
[08:49.35]Bionic boomer stream!
[08:57.35]I'm not gonna give you the punchline, because that's very important.
[09:01.24]But it's not the Bionic Boomer stream.
[09:03.84]That's completely different.
[09:05.26]This is something else.
[09:07.48]But, like, I need some community help on it, I think.
[09:13.23]I'll throw the line out in the Discord later.
[09:15.23]Alright, let's go.
[09:22.53]Do I get to create my character?
[09:23.59]What do you want to practice?
[09:26.15]I want to practice attacking.
[09:27.03]Blocking.
[09:27.73]Let's do some Spartan.
[09:28.59]No.
[09:30.33]Regular fighter.
[09:33.23]Okay, do I know everything?
[09:37.99]Do I need to spar?
[09:42.02]Non-lethal weapons.
[09:42.76]Alright, let's go.
[09:45.22]I'm ready.
[09:48.28]Okay, killed that guy.
[09:49.88]We're supposed to do non-lethal attacks.
[09:55.14]Okay.
[09:57.81]Next time, be more careful.
[09:59.49]Well, I... Okay.
[10:00.67]Did I hit him right in the face?
[10:05.19]That was good, but next time be more careful.
[10:08.17]Okay.
[10:10.51]I'll be more careful.
[10:14.59]Why can't I block this?
[10:24.22]Okay, this guy obviously is not gonna spar with me.
[10:30.38]I'd like to do something else.
[10:33.56]Alright, what's this?
[10:37.40]You get a block every time they change the direction.
[10:39.32]Okay.
[10:40.90]Riding Trainer.
[10:41.57]Good day!
[10:41.93]I have come here for some riding practice, but my old bones are aching badly, so I decided to give myself a rest today.
[10:47.71]If you would like to practice your horsemanship, you can take my horse here.
[10:51.57]The exercise would be good for her.
[10:54.00]Yes, I'd love to practice riding.
[10:56.88]Pre-recorded Shreem talking voice.
[10:59.54]Good, now I'll give you a few exercises that will teach you riding and horseback weapon use.
[11:04.40]Just take your horse for a ride around the course.
[11:06.32]Go as slow or as fast as you like.
[11:08.66]Come back when you feel confident as a rider, and I'll give you some tougher exercises, okay?
[11:15.44]Mount a horse by F. That's practice horse.
[11:20.83]Ride to a... How do you ride?
[11:21.79]Just W-A-S-D?
[11:22.97]Oh, sorry.
[11:23.41]A-S-W-D?
[11:24.09]Whatever they said?
[11:29.61]This is very loud.
[11:30.47]I may need to turn this down a little bit.
[11:42.42]Alright, so don't attack anything, just ride?
[11:45.00]Is there a faster way to go?
[11:54.37]What kind of weapons do I get in this game?
[11:58.15]Stick?
[11:59.85]Long stick?
[12:00.99]Short stick?
[12:03.65]This is like 1645, right?
[12:06.39]All they had was brums back then, they didn't have any real weapons.
[12:17.42]They had molotovs?
[12:18.20]No, they didn't.
[12:23.81]You finished the exercise.
[12:24.65]Now go back to the trainer and talk to him.
[12:25.83]Okay.
[12:25.97]How do I get off?
[12:31.65]Oh, thanks.
[12:33.09]How do I get off the horse?
[12:36.20]F. Okay.
[12:37.86]Move on to something a bit more difficult.
[12:38.92]Grab the lance you see over there and ride around the course, hitting each target at least once.
[12:43.99]Okay, grab the lance.
[12:44.85]Grab the long stick.
[12:46.83]See?
[12:48.15]It's just huge brooms.
[12:55.83]Strike the dummy.
[13:00.31]How?
[13:01.20]Just... Got it.
[13:06.60]Not really that good at mounted combat, apparently.
[13:08.54]Is there a certain, like, hitbox or something?
[13:12.62]Or is it...
[13:21.97]Okay, there we go.
[13:22.75]It's a little weird.
[13:28.80]I'm gonna run into people like this accidentally.
[13:32.22]Alright, that's not bad.
[13:34.58]This game's fucking sick!
[13:36.42]I'm just kidding.
[13:45.60]No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding guys, don't worry.
[13:48.73]I'm in the damn tutorial.
[13:51.73]It is, though.
[13:52.15]I know, I know.
[13:52.63]I'm just fucking around.
[13:58.61]Okay.
[14:03.17]Delivered 29, so... This really is, like, third-person Kenshi.
[14:08.09]Just the way that it looks.
[14:09.81]It's by the same people?
[14:10.67]Did the same one guy make this game?
[14:14.99]Uh, your next challenge would be to using a bow and arrow to shoot at the archery targets by the road.
[14:20.12]From each target to consider yourself successful.
[14:22.32]Okay.
[14:23.72]Go near the practice bone, press F to pick it up.
[14:27.44]How do I get off the horse?
[14:30.32]You didn't give me that information.
[14:31.38]How do I get off?
[14:33.85]How do I get off?
[14:36.17]F?
[14:38.13]Oh.
[14:42.17]Oh, come on.
[14:42.65]In fucking... In Red Dead Redemption, you just have to press triangle.
[14:56.05]Now do I need to... on horseback, so I gotta ride over there and do it?
[15:03.85]So shoot it, how do I shoot it?
[15:04.89]Just hold it down?
[15:05.71]Okay.
[15:10.27]Is there a way to stabilize?
[15:14.97]What's like the drop on this?
[15:21.18]Press R. First person.
[15:27.52]Um.
[15:32.96]Where's the- Got it.
[15:39.17]Uh, I don't want that view.
[15:40.37]I'd rather be on this view.
[15:45.25]It's gonna aim way higher than that.
[15:51.16]Okay, this is weird.
[15:57.50]Can I... Press... you hold shift to zoom in.
[16:09.01]Okay, so you gotta aim higher than that.
[16:14.57]Control plus space?
[16:24.86]Why do you have the dummies in the same place there?
[16:32.46]I'd rather not go first person.
[16:40.41]That hit.
[16:40.91]What?
[16:41.07]That didn't hit?
[16:43.71]How did that not hit?
[16:51.43]Okay.
[16:52.71]Can I please...
[17:01.41]I hit it the first time.
[17:02.33]Horse Archery is OP.
[17:12.83]Chat is dumb.
[17:13.65]Level it up.
[17:16.35]Well, let me learn how to do it first.
[17:22.39]One guy said that, but guess what?
[17:24.05]Cash in your one guy tokens!
[17:27.90]I also made myself a lot louder.
[17:29.92]Am I like really fucking loud?
[17:31.58]I should be really loud.
[17:38.36]I didn't increase the volume of my voice.
[17:40.36]Alright.
[17:43.74]What the hell do I do?
[17:44.27]That guy just like dropped and did like push-ups.
[17:56.86]You're standing in a really awkward, weird place.
[17:59.90]No.
[18:02.86]Did I do it all?
[18:05.97]Am I tutorial done?
[18:06.95]I don't see anything else to do.
[18:16.79]What about this guy?
[18:23.09]Archery.
[18:23.51]Okay, hold on.
[18:25.38]Well, I didn't even know how to do this.
[18:26.87]I went to the horseback archery before I did the regular archery.
[18:31.85]The bow is a difficult weapon to master, but once you are sufficiently good at it, you can shoot quickly and with great power.
[18:38.15]Shoot the targets.
[18:48.10]The size of the targeting recticule indicates your accuracy.
[18:51.82]Press and hold down the left mouse button until the recticule shrinks down to its minimum size.
[18:55.83]Release the left mouse button when its recticle is at its smallest.
[18:59.81]If you wait too long, the recticle will expand again.
[19:01.23]Alright, okay, I get you.
[19:10.29]Hey, whoa!
[19:12.13]Easy!
[19:15.65]Put the fucking safety on!
[19:21.04]Well, so let's take a look at how the drop is then.
[19:25.29]That's not hitting it.
[19:29.57]Am I fucking missing something here?
[19:36.65]No, those are going in.
[19:38.47]So that, okay, I am hitting it.
[19:56.62]Do I have to hit this 72 times?
[20:10.66]Okay, wha- ohhhhhhh!
[20:19.70]Well, I- alright.
[20:21.54]I'm sorry, but guys standing here, there are targets over here, people practicing!
[20:34.45]I hit it.
[20:34.81]Did I hit the tip?
[20:43.44]Oh, that's not going where I want it to.
[20:54.97]Not bad.
[20:55.41]Not bad at all.
[20:55.79]You seem to have grasped the basics of archery.
[20:57.25]Now try to do the same thing with a crossbow.
[21:00.49]Take the crossbow of the bolts over there and shoot those three targets.
[21:03.70]The crossbow is much easier to shoot compared with the bow.
[21:07.10]But you need to reload it after each shot.
[21:10.18]Yeah.
[21:12.90]I think I'm going to be a crossbow guy.
[21:14.21]Okay, let's zoom it in.
[21:22.36]Ooh.
[21:23.22]How do you reload?
[21:23.74]Just... like that.
[21:30.16]This thing's great.
[21:32.26]I mean, it does take too long to reload, but... Alrighty, good.
[21:39.80]You didn't have too much difficulty using the crossbow either.
[21:41.89]Next you'll learn to use throwing weapons.
[21:43.77]Pick up the javelins you see over there and try to hit those three targets.
[21:49.17]Alright, let's pick up the fucking sausage.
[21:53.68]Let's get the big cigar.
[21:54.76]Let's get the big cartoon bachelor party cigar.
[21:57.26]Oh, that's weird.
[22:12.45]Oh.
[22:15.57]Okay.
[22:22.04]Takes a little adjusting.
[22:22.94]Yeah, it's all right.
[22:25.16]Well, with that, you have received the basic skills to use all three types of ranged weapons.
[22:28.96]The rest will come with practice.
[22:31.42]Train each and every day.
[22:34.12]And in time, you will be as good as the best marksman in Calradia.
[22:40.29]Now go talk with the melee fighters of the hostmanship trainer.
[22:43.31]They can teach you important stuff.
[22:44.29]So I did it all.
[22:46.03]So I'm good, right?
[22:49.45]So direction, block, direction...
[22:54.12]Archery.
[22:54.60]Alright, so just hit tab.
[23:00.10]Start a new game.
[23:04.95]Oh god.
[23:05.51]Now I gotta do the fucking voice.
[23:07.47]I gotta put on a fucking voice now.
[23:10.23]Welcome adventurer to Mountain Blade Warband.
[23:13.22]Before beginning the game, you must create your character.
[23:15.49]No, this is not that important.
[23:17.47]Remember that in the traditional medieval society depicted in the game, war and politics are usually dominated by male members of the nobility.
[23:24.25]That does not, however, mean that you should not choose to play a female character, or one who is not of noble birth.
[23:29.70]Male nobles may have a somewhat easier start, but women and commoners can attain all the same goals, and in fact may have much more interesting, if more challenging, early game.
[23:39.16]Okay.
[23:41.01]Uh...
[23:43.64]Sometimes I just- I want the game just to be- It said it was gonna be like, harder.
[23:48.30]To be like, You were born years ago in a land far away!
[24:01.38]Easy- No, I'll just- Everybody quiet down!
[24:04.82]Ev- Everybody quiet down!
[24:07.25]Or I'm gonna put on the YouTuber voice.
[24:09.19]Do you want that this whole stream?
[24:11.79]I'll do it!
[24:14.95]You were born years ago in a land far away.
[24:17.69]Your father was a noble because that's the easy one.
[24:21.99]A thief, a hunter, a veteran warrior.
[24:36.08]This is not me though, this is my father.
[24:37.60]I don't have to be like my father.
[24:40.79]A hunter.
[24:49.59]I don't know.
[24:53.80]You came into this world a son of a declining nobility, owing only the house in which they lived.
[25:00.38]However, despite your family's hardships, they afforded you a good education and trained you from childhood for the...
[25:10.51]and life in court he started to learn about the world almost as soon as you could walk and talk you spent your early life as a page at the nobleman's court a street urchin I want I'm I'm a politician
[25:38.42]As a boy growing out of childhood, you were sent to live in the court of one of the nobles of the land.
[25:43.50]There, your first lessons were in humility, as you waited upon the lords and ladies of the household.
[25:49.63]But from their chess games, their gossip, even the poetry of great deeds and courtly love, you quickly began to learn about the adult world of conflict and competition.
[25:58.51]You also learned from the rough games of the other children, who battered at each other with sticks in imitation of their elders' swords.
[26:06.26]Then as the young adult life changed, as it always does, you became... a game poacher.
[26:16.76]A university student.
[26:22.10]I got a real fucking non-video game life here, don't I?
[26:28.22]But you're a thief!
[26:33.02]A peasant!
[26:34.54]Working my way up here.
[26:35.34]I was a warrior!
[26:36.66]I read books.
[26:37.56]No, that's not a video game.
[26:39.97]Start?
[26:43.03]No, the distinction felt sudden to you.
[26:45.51]Somewhere along the way you'd become a man.
[26:47.30]And the whole world seemed to change around you.
[26:51.04]you found yourself as a student in the university of one of the great cities where you study theology philosophy and medicine but not all your lessons were learned in the lecture halls you may or may not have joined in with your fellows as they roam the alleys in search of wine women and a good fight however you certainly were able to observe how broken jaw is set how an angry townsman can be persuaded to set down his club and accept cash as compensation for the destruction of his shop
[27:19.91]But soon everything changed and you decided to strike out on your own as an adventurer.
[27:24.49]What made you take this decision was personal revenge!
[27:32.98]Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer.
[27:38.59]Still, it was not a difficult choice to leave with the rage burning brightly in your heart.
[27:44.18]You want vengeance.
[27:45.70]You want justice.
[27:46.98]What was done to you cannot be undone, and these debts are only to be paid in blood.
[27:56.96]Become an adventurer and ride to your destiny.
[28:01.57]All right, we got... We got the noble houses of Game of Thrones.

[29:52.95]Now, enter your name and distribute your attribute and skill and weapon points.
[29:56.61]You can click on various elements on the screen to learn how each one will affect your character.
[30:00.58]Alright, I'm not doing... I won't do that anymore.

[30:57.52]Carton.
[31:05.26]Strength, agility... I need to read these.
[31:08.44]Every point adds plus one to hit points.
[31:10.31]So this is health.
[31:15.87]And the following skills cannot be developed beyond one third of strength.
[31:20.77]agility each point gives you five gives five weapon points and increased movement speed so this is weapon points and movement speed this next one is int every point intelligence immediately gives one extra skill point so this is a skill point so this is for this
[31:45.58]And then Cha.
[31:46.98]Cha, each point increases your party limit size by plus one.
[31:49.60]The following skills cannot be developed.
[31:50.98]Okay, so this is party limit.
[31:55.97]Those of you that are just joining us for the first time, or that have never seen me play a game like this, I have no idea what to do.
[32:02.35]This is the first time I've ever opened a Mount & Blade game, ever.
[32:05.75]That's a lie.
[32:06.69]I opened this one like a year and a half ago, and like looked at the menu a little bit.
[32:16.41]I don't know what to do.
[32:17.91]And this is gonna be terrible because people are gonna get so angry with me.
[32:20.95]Because I'm gonna put like two points into spotting.
[32:23.63]And everyone's gonna be like... Why would you put points into spotting?
[32:27.58]That's not... That's the worst thing you could have put it in.
[32:29.60]Alright, I'm gonna go with just basic dog shit.
[32:35.87]I think I need some speed.
[32:42.39]I get weapon points.
[32:44.01]I'm putting a point into agility.
[32:46.37]It's already done.
[32:55.30]Okay.
[32:58.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[33:00.54]Reset.
[33:01.12]Reset, reset, reset.
[33:11.21]Okay.

[33:18.06]I gotta make a choice here.
[33:19.02]One-handed, two-handed, polearm, archery, crossbow, or... You throw javelins, darts, stones.
[33:33.83]I could throw rocks.
[33:36.65]Why did you tell me I could throw rocks at people?
[33:38.57]Don't do that.
[33:43.12]I don't want to be like the shitty rock guy.
[33:55.37]What have I done?
[33:55.81]Did I do that wrong?
[34:04.37]I'm throwing rocks at people.
[34:05.45]I'm gonna throw shit at people.
[34:10.51]Okay.
[34:12.73]First aid.
[34:16.33]Powered throw.
[34:21.29]Each point to this skill increases throwing damage by 10%.
[34:24.88]Oh, I hate this.
[34:33.44]I need more strength.
[34:42.87]Hold on a minute here.
[34:45.41]The following skills cannot be developed beyond one third of strength.
[34:49.49]Alright, right, right, right, right.
[34:50.43]I need like... I need like three more points in here.
[34:54.73]Sugary is good?
[34:55.65]What's sugary?
[34:58.61]Sugary?
[34:59.93]Like my coffee?
[35:00.79]What are you talking about?
[35:04.64]Surgery.
[35:06.50]Alright, let's get... Uh...
[35:10.36]I don't know.
[35:10.76]This is too overwhelming to me.
[35:11.98]How about iron flesh?
[35:16.38]I need to read them.
[35:17.11]Just everybody hold on.
[35:17.89]I need to read these.
[35:19.21]Somebody's... Why can nobody see this?
[35:20.73]Somebody just gave 50 bucks.
[35:25.17]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[35:26.17]Why can this not... It's not showing up.
[35:34.61]Oh, what the fuck?
[35:35.17]It wasn't... For some reason, it wasn't pulling from the... Okay.
[35:38.71]That was Great Canadian Fuck Club.
[35:42.62]Great Canadian says... War crimes against Swadian peasants don't count as war crimes.
[35:51.42]Is that a reference to this game?
[35:53.46]I don't know what that means.
[35:56.79]Thank you for the $50.
[36:01.78]I don't know.
[36:03.16]I'm not going to go... I'm not war crimes.
[36:04.82]Who are you talking about?
[36:05.66]I'm a fucking politician.
[36:07.20]I'm going to fight.
[36:08.64]I'm going to fight for everybody.
[36:09.98]For people.
[36:11.44]I'm going to bring everybody together here.
[36:13.86]My father was a noble.
[36:15.40]I was a noble.
[36:17.15]And I'm going to bring the fucking world together.
[36:18.67]I'm not going to draw a fucking pint of blood.
[36:27.13]I might throw a few rocks though.
[36:29.51]But...
[36:31.21]It's alright.
[36:33.27]Alright, so we got a... Thank you so much, though.
[36:36.19]Seriously, 50 bucks.
[36:37.09]I need to read these.
[36:37.89]Alright, hold on.
[36:40.39]Hit points by plus 2.
[36:41.33]That's all this does.
[36:42.97]It's stupid.
[36:44.12]It's dumb.
[36:44.82]And you should never put a point into it.
[36:46.26]Right, guys?
[36:47.86]Each point to this skill increases melee damage by 8%.
[36:50.06]That's pretty great.
[36:56.28]Let's character use more powerful bows.
[36:58.15]Each point to this skill...
[37:03.04]Oh.
[37:04.76]It's one of those days.
[37:05.56]I don't know why I'm in one of these moods.
[37:08.31]So this is like Super Bow.
[37:10.43]Makes it easier to learn weapon proficiencies.
[37:12.17]Increases the proficiency limits.
[37:13.17]Limits go to 60, 100, 140, 180, 120, 260, 300.
[37:15.55]So weapons... Weapon proficiencies go up easier.
[37:21.75]I don't know what that means.
[37:22.43]Shield.
[37:23.74]Reduces damage to shields.
[37:25.30]I don't... I'm not going to use a shield.
[37:26.78]I'm just... Am I?
[37:28.94]You're running speed.
[37:30.10]Not bad.
[37:33.38]Higher difficulty riding skill.

[37:47.21]I saw that before it even popped up.
[37:50.17]Looting.
[37:50.49]The skill increases the amount of loot obtained by 10%.
[37:57.04]I'm sorry, but that looks good to me.
[38:03.84]Every day, each hero with this skill adds some experience to every other member of the party.
[38:14.76]That's kind of cool.
[38:18.18]Tracking.
[38:19.82]Tracks become more informative.
[38:25.68]Starting battle advantage for every two points.
[38:27.97]What is battle advantage?
[38:28.89]Pathfinding.
[38:30.29]Party map speed is increased by 3%.
[38:31.65]What does that mean?
[38:34.07]Spotting.
[38:35.75]Party seeding range is increased by 10%.
[38:36.99]What does that even mean?

[38:39.23]Increases inventory capacity by plus 6 per skill level.
[38:43.36]How big is my inventory standard?
[38:47.84]Party healing speed is increased by 20% per level of the skill.
[38:52.21]Mm-hmm.
[38:53.37]Surgery.
[38:54.11]Each point to the skill gives a 4% chance that a mortally struck party member will be wounded rather than killed.
[39:00.33]Uh-huh.
[39:01.03]First aid.
[39:02.24]Heroes regain 5% per skill level of hit points lost during a mission.
[39:06.98]I like that one too.
[39:07.88]Engineer.
[39:09.20]Construct siege equipment and... No, no, no, no.

[39:17.11]I don't have enough cha.
[39:19.27]Prisoner management.
[39:20.39]Every level of the skill increases maximum number of prisoners by five.
[39:22.99]No, I'm a fucking... I'm gonna unite everybody.
[39:28.48]Number of troops you can command by five.
[39:31.62]And trade.
[39:33.11]This is trade penalty.
[39:42.85]I'm gonna go with first aid.
[39:46.76]You didn't do it right!
[39:47.64]That's too late.

[43:12.96]Shitload of community subs going on right now here.
[43:17.95]Okay, I like this so far.
[43:20.87]I like it actually completely.
[43:21.87]Alright, that's good.
[43:40.61]Done.
[43:42.71]Alright.
[43:45.88]You hear about Calradia, a land torn between rival kingdoms battling each other for supremacy, a haven for knights and mercenaries, cutthroats and adventurers all willing to risk their lives in pursuit of fortune, power, or glory.
[43:58.23]In this land, which holds great dangers and even greater opportunities,
[44:02.13]You believe you may leave your past behind and start a new life.
[44:04.86]You feel that finally you hold the key of your destiny in your hands.
[44:09.14]Free to choose as you will, and that whatever course you take, great adventures will await you.
[44:14.16]Drawn by the stories you hear about Calradia and its kingdoms, you...
[44:19.41]I don't know what any of this is.
[44:46.02]I could throw a dice in the air in this one.
[44:47.75]I don't know what any of these people are.
[44:49.03]I don't know what any of these people are.
[44:50.13]I don't know who, what, when, why, how, or when about any of these.
[44:53.91]So I'm just gonna go like this.
[45:03.56]Kingdom... But somebody just, like... My, like, bias.
[45:07.48]My, like, hand bias picked this.
[45:13.03]I had hand bias here, I think.
[45:20.63]Do a poll?
[45:21.23]I can't even write all this down.
[45:22.63]I'm gonna turn on clicks.
[45:26.73]Because I can't... I'm not gonna write all this shit down.
[45:31.15]Hold on.
[45:38.32]Just click.
[45:44.72]I ain't gonna zoom this way to fucking... Hold on.
[45:46.60]Stop, stop, stop.
[45:47.26]Nobody click.
[45:47.74]Nobody click.
[45:48.18]Stop clicking.
[45:48.60]Don't click anything.
[45:49.16]Nobody click.
[45:56.59]Alright, that's probably good enough.
[46:03.05]No, it's not good enough.
[46:03.73]It's got to be closer, doesn't it?
[46:05.41]No, I think we're good.
[46:12.81]Kingdom of the Nords, it looks like.
[46:20.48]Yeah.
[46:21.40]Looks like we're going to the Nords.
[46:24.93]That's 10,000 clicks.
[46:25.35]How the fuck could there be 10,000 clicks when there's only 3.5 billion people on Earth?
[46:32.31]You know what I'm saying?
[46:33.83]There's only 3.6 billion people here.
[46:35.96]How could there be 10 billion clicks?
[46:38.80]Alright, it's Nords.
[46:39.44]Let's go.
[46:45.82]That's an old meme, Jerma.
[46:51.92]Kingdom of the Nords.
[46:55.73]Whatever that means.
[47:01.07]I just look over at the chat and I see, oh my god, he's gonna get wrecked!
[47:03.52]He's gonna get wrecked!
[47:06.72]You took passage with a trading longship, carrying... gerfalcons from the furthest reaches of the north to be bartered for linen and wool.
[47:16.98]The best part about making an RPG is you can just make up words.
[47:20.18]You can make, it doesn't matter what the fucking word is, it can mean anything.
[47:26.49]Okay, and it sailed early in the season, but the master reckoned that the risks of drifting ice and later winter storms could be justified by arriving ahead of the Sea Raiders, who by April would be sailing forth from their island lairs to ravage Calradia's coasts.
[47:41.70]It was some relief when your ship came in sight of the delta of the Ville and Bollock rivers, and a short while later rode past tidal flats and coastal marshes to the city of Sargoth, home to the Sea Raiders' distant kinsmen, the Nordic Lords, who a few generations ago had carved themselves a kingdom in this rich but troubled land.
[48:04.76]Okay.
[48:04.88]What?
[48:35.57]This guy?
[48:37.47]Oh, the sound of a blade.
[48:44.48]Oh, God.
[48:50.14]Reload it!
[48:52.22]Reload it!
[48:54.66]How do I... What?
[48:56.36]How do I change weapon?
[48:58.24]Do I have another weapon?
[49:07.22]It's this one person.
[49:11.00]I can't reload.
[49:13.34]I have to punch him.
[49:13.98]What?
[49:15.82]Where am I?
[49:20.65]How do I get out of here?
[49:41.32]Give me the fucking bow.
[49:49.31]He can kick.
[49:49.99]Okay, seriously though, like, I need to... I need to... Why do I not have a weapon?
[50:01.92]Scroll up.
[50:02.56]What?
[50:03.48]The tutorial didn't tell me scroll up.
[50:14.35]Oh god, who's this?
[50:16.33]Who's this?
[50:23.32]I did the whole tutorial and not once did they say, by the way, make sure you scroll up is to get your melee weapon and scroll down is for your shield.
[50:31.62]Who the fuck are you?
[50:34.42]Are you alright?
[50:35.73]Well, I guess you're alive at any rate.
[50:37.67]I'm not sure that we can say the same for the other fellow.
[50:40.03]That's one less thief to trouble our streets at night.
[50:42.55]Although heaven knows he won't be the last.
[50:45.65]Anyway, maybe you can help me with something.
[50:48.41]Let's talk more inside.
[50:49.67]Out here, we don't know who's listening.
[50:57.10]The merchant takes you to his house.
[50:58.30]Once inside, he stands by the door for a while, checking the street, and then finally, convinced you've not been followed, comes near you to speak.
[51:06.51]It's a lie, he's coming to kill me.
[51:13.32]Can I reload this?
[51:14.92]Oops.
[51:18.44]I can't take my bolts back?
[51:22.38]Sorry, I was just testing that.
[51:24.28]Alright, what do we need?
[51:25.00]Uh... Now let me explain my proposition.
[51:32.81]We've always had brigands in the hills, driven to banditry by war, debt, or love of violence.
[51:39.74]Recently, however, they've been getting bolder, leaving their camps in the wild and venturing into town, looking for unwary prey.
[51:46.94]The...
[51:51.10]The watch commander tells us it's because of all the fighting on the frontiers.
[51:55.18]Fewer men to keep an eye on the streets, but I'm not sure what to make of that.
[51:58.86]It seems to me that the most logical explanation is that these bandits have an ally inside the walls who helps them enter unnoticed and helps them identify particularly tempting targets.
[52:09.33]Last week, you see, they took my brother.
[52:14.09]I don't know what my brother was thinking.
[52:15.95]A lad from a prominent house.
[52:17.31]This is just a bad, uh... This is a bad audiobook.
[52:22.18]This is like they outsourced the audiobook to, like, Fiverr, is what I'm doing right now.
[52:27.62]Seriously.
[52:29.96]I don't know what my brother was thinking.
[52:31.45]A lad from a prominent house out alone after dark in times like these.
[52:35.98]Well, I suppose you were too.
[52:37.75]But you're a stranger here, and didn't know how bad things have become.
[52:41.97]He had no such excuse, but he's family.
[52:44.91]So what can you do?
[52:46.47]If you don't protect your kin, then people will start thinking that you can't protect your investments either.
[52:51.29]And I can't have that.
[52:53.02]No doubt the gang will soon send word about a ransom, but I don't care to pay it.
[52:59.58]Do a Nord voice.
[53:00.64]I don't know what that means.
[53:03.54]What do you mean a Nord voice?
[53:06.71]So here's my proposition.
[53:08.22]Now that I can only do Irish.
[53:19.65]So here's my proposition.
[53:22.01]You look like you've had a bit of experience with a blade, and more importantly, you must have a bit of fire in your belly, or you wouldn't be coming to Calradia to seek your fortune.
[53:31.41]So here's what I'm asking you to do.
[53:34.25]Gather a small party, track down these bandits to their lair, teach them a lesson they won't forget, and get my brother back safe.
[53:41.42]In return, you'll earn my lasting gratitude and a bit of silver.
[53:45.44]What do you say?
[53:48.02]You fucking nailed it!
[53:56.53]you won't be able to do this by yourself though if you try and take on the whole gang of single-handedly the hunter will become the hunted and I'll warrant you'll first want to round up a group of volunteers there's always a few lads in the villages around here looking for a bit of work that's more interesting than tilling the soil or hauling water they'll follow you if you pay so take this purse of a hundred
[54:18.84]denars considered an advance on your reward go around to the villages and use the money to hire some help I'll reckon that you need at least five men to take on these bandits five men okay very good sir I'll go collect some men from their own villages good they could find me again a tavern here in sargoth after you've got your group together then we'll speak about what we do next
[54:46.71]You have taken your first quest.
[54:47.95]You may view your quest log by pressing Q at any time during the game.
[54:53.59]That was me.
[54:54.63]What the hell is this?
[55:03.46]How do I get out of here?
[55:09.24]Can't.
[55:10.95]Get out.
[55:13.09]Why am I like a piece on a board?
[55:14.41]Why am I like in the Legend of Zelda overworld map?
[55:25.78]Oh, fuck.
[55:26.34]No, no, no.
[55:26.70]Wait, wait, wait.
[55:27.12]Go back over here.
[55:28.29]Go back in here.
[55:32.27]Playing might and magic.
[55:35.17]Go... Hold on.
[55:37.31]From other... The prosperous town of Saragoth is bustling with activity.
[55:40.17]The people look well-fed and relatively content.
[55:42.85]Craftsmen do a thriving business and some migrants appear to be coming here from other regions to seek their luck.
[55:48.78]You see the banner of King Ragnar of Kingdom of Nords over the town gates.
[55:52.16]The populace is indifferent to you.
[55:55.54]Go to the tavern, right?
[55:58.32]I gotta find some friends, right?
[56:01.36]That was the quest?
[56:03.58]Collect five men.
[56:05.92]Merchant of Sargoth wants you to collect at least five men from nearby villages.
[56:09.82]After you collect these men, find and speak with him.
[56:11.56]He is in the tavern of Sargoth.
[56:12.76]So, nearby villages.
[56:14.85]That doesn't mean here.
[56:17.99]So I do have to go to the map.
[56:19.35]But first, let me just swing my sword into this guy's neck.
[56:22.03]Wait, what?
[56:26.68]I'm not sure if some kind of... Excuse me.
[56:35.52]What?
[56:36.10]I didn't do anything!
[56:40.01]What did I do?
[56:40.69]I didn't do anything.
[56:43.11]I'm all talk.
[56:48.51]I'm gonna put my fucking sword in this guy's neck.
[56:50.51]I'm sorry!
[56:51.19]What happened?
[56:52.43]I'm sorry, I'll leave.
[56:54.90]Okay, I need to get out of here.
[56:56.10]Do I have any health packs?
[57:01.02]Okay, character.
[57:06.18]Fish.
[57:08.14]Plus four to morale.
[57:09.92]The... The Dire Militari.
[57:14.28]I'm gonna fucking die.
[57:15.73]I need to find a village around the town.
[57:17.57]Okay, so here's Sargoth.
[57:19.79]Here's Kirin Castle.
[57:22.41]And here's... Quinn.
[57:24.53]Should we go to Quinn?
[57:28.75]Fenada?
[57:30.86]Let's go to... Let's go to Quinn.
[57:34.18]I gotta recruit people.
[57:35.10]Who's that?
[57:35.46]Not for a stroll, are we?
[57:37.54]Why's the guy naked?
[57:39.38]This is a robbery, eh?
[57:40.84]No, no, no, no, no.
[57:42.64]This is a robbery, eh?
[57:44.00]I'm giving you one chance to hand over everything you got, or me and my mates will kill you, understand?
[57:49.30]I'm afraid of you lot.
[57:51.10]Fight me if you dare.
[57:54.08]You've encountered looters.
[57:55.14]You have one troop fit for battle against.
[57:57.13]They're twelve.
[58:01.63]Twelve?
[58:06.77]Where are... Do they exist?
[58:08.60]Where are they?
[58:08.90]Twelve?
[58:09.30]Twelve?
[58:19.38]There he is!
[58:20.74]Get that son of a bitch!
[58:26.31]That was so inaccurate.
[58:28.09]Give me my sword, give me my sword.
[58:29.07]I'll take him out one by one.
[58:33.79]This guy back here.
[58:39.60]Tally-ho!
[58:46.82]This is fucking ridiculous.
[58:47.74]I need to get like a 12 people.
[58:55.95]Okay, hold on.
[59:05.74]I can't do this.
[59:06.36]How do I get out of here?
[59:09.70]You've retreated from the fight.
[59:11.66]Oh, it's that easy.
[59:13.36]You've encountered looters.
[59:14.36]You...
[59:16.27]I thought I just ran away.
[59:22.43]Get off the horse.
[59:33.13]Oh fuck, they didn't go anywhere.
[59:44.62]Got him!
[59:50.56]Can I just fucking ram him like a bowling ball?
[60:00.26]No, I didn't get a strike.
[60:09.29]I'm supposed to leave the town to get people.
[60:13.33]I hit that guy right in the fucking head.
[60:15.56]I killed him.
[60:16.86]Holy shit, that guy's dead.
[60:18.44]Let's do that 11 more times.
[60:30.93]The guy's throwing rocks.
[60:32.01]I gotta learn how to be one of those guys.
[60:41.76]Ugh!
[60:44.92]Fuck you!
[60:53.41]God damn it!
[60:56.69]Use my shield!
[60:57.51]Done!
[61:02.65]I just gotta do that ten more times.
[61:18.07]My health?
[61:18.53]I'll be alright.
[61:19.11]There's a guy in the corner here.
[61:35.32]Just gotta hit him in the head.
[61:49.05]Got ya!
[61:52.28]They're not so tough.
[61:54.12]It's a bunch of shitties.
[62:08.47]Got him!
[62:09.73]This is so stupid.
[62:14.60]One by one they charge at me, and one by one they fall!
[62:27.93]Okay, what?
[62:28.29]They haven't made it out of fucking cement?
[62:29.98]I hit him right in the knee.
[62:38.61]The guy has, like, fucking cement feet.
[62:40.09]Alright, I need a better... One mistake and you're dead.
[62:50.24]I'm not gonna make one.
[62:58.52]Imagine looking out the window of the castle and seeing this shit.
[63:04.14]Wow, this is fucking dumb.
[63:05.84]What do we do?
[63:07.58]Just leave him.
[63:10.35]Use your crossbow from the horse.
[63:12.03]Ree.
[63:13.43]Yeah, but it was so inaccurate.
[63:14.67]I can't even aim this thing.
[63:20.39]Like, see?
[63:20.73]I'm just gonna waste arrows.
[63:33.45]The arrows regenerate.
[63:34.69]That guy thinks he's gonna get away.
[63:41.68]Remember what I said at the beginning?
[63:43.32]No fucking mercy.
[63:44.28]Okay, we're fine.
[64:11.62]Everyone thought I was gonna lose.
[64:16.14]Watch out.
[64:20.02]Gotta make this one count.
[64:23.20]Where's my... I win.
[64:27.97]Now what?
[64:29.69]Now what do I do?
[64:36.78]You won?
[64:37.48]Okay, wait.
[64:37.90]I gotta...
[64:40.68]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[64:41.52]I don't want that.
[64:42.66]Bolts.
[64:43.00]Pick those up.
[64:44.40]What do you mean I can't take that?
[64:49.05]Why can't I take the bolts?
[64:56.91]I can't take bolts.
[64:58.37]I have zero bolts now.
[65:07.06]Oh.
[65:14.67]Oh, God.
[65:15.99]Okay, I thought I had to go around and pick up stuff.
[65:17.71]You know what I mean?
[65:20.83]That's what I thought I had to do.
[65:32.37]Stones.
[65:32.83]Nice.
[65:33.15]I'll take them.
[65:34.47]Is it right-click?
[65:39.49]I thought this was going to be like El Dio de Diablo de los Huertos 2.
[65:43.72]But apparently not.
[65:51.52]Is there like a take everything button?
[65:56.11]That's an old joke.
[65:57.01]Shift click.
[65:59.01]Not shift click.
[65:59.59]Control click.
[66:01.43]How much do these weigh?
[66:02.17]Should I not pick these all up?
[66:07.01]This is too much weight.
[66:16.95]Oh, fuck, I have no more room.
[66:19.89]So this shit down here sucks.
[66:22.63]25, sell price.
[66:29.11]Okay, so we're gonna... Sell price.
[66:33.75]17, these things suck.
[66:38.93]Sell price 105, okay, so then... What do I have that's a piece of shit?
[66:43.00]Sell price 11, so...
[66:47.70]So price 11.
[66:48.36]I need the rocks, because I'm telling you, I'm rock... These ones are fucking terrible.
[66:58.07]Okay, looks pretty good.
[67:00.47]Put on the outfit.
[67:01.53]Wait, just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[67:05.51]Do I have any boots?
[67:07.59]Woolen hose.
[67:10.40]Wait, plus 3 to leg armor, plus 4 to leg armor, these things suck.
[67:14.06]Plus 7 to body armor, plus 2 to leg armor, plus 21 to body armor.
[67:17.08]24, 22, 21, 21, 21, 24, 24.
[67:17.30]Okay.
[67:17.54]Put on the rocks.
[67:19.02]I will, in due time.
[67:19.68]This is, uh, swing rating 20, uh, B.
[67:39.68]Weapon reach 70.
[67:40.44]No, this seems better.
[67:47.80]Can I put the rocks on?
[67:48.60]No, I can't.
[67:51.14]Alright, good.
[68:02.91]Fuck the shield.
[68:15.73]I can't read the book.
[68:16.69]That's not how you read.
[68:18.07]4,000!
[68:18.53]No gloves.
[68:24.05]This game's fucking fun.
[68:27.90]Now, how do I get routed enemies traveling to Sargoth?
[68:31.08]So they're leaving.
[68:34.62]Read the book.
[68:36.56]Requires nine intelligence to read.
[68:39.66]I can't read this.
[68:40.30]I don't have nine intelligence, do I?
[68:46.46]Save the game.
[68:46.98]Okay, let's go here.
[68:49.74]What the fuck was that?
[68:57.04]I will drink from your skull.
[69:00.37]I'm not afraid of you.
[69:01.17]I will fight.
[69:02.39]You've encountered sea raiders.
[69:04.27]You have zero troops for a battle against their five.
[69:08.07]Why do I have to... Why can't I fight?
[69:14.85]Your enemies take you prisoner.
[69:18.87]I couldn't fight?
[69:19.73]Where are we going?
[69:20.99]What?
[69:24.16]Wait, hold on.
[69:24.68]Why am I not allowed to fight?
[69:27.84]After painful days of being dragged about as a prisoner, you find a chance to escape from your captors.
[69:35.87]This is so far away.
[70:03.91]I know.
[70:04.79]I knew that you didn't know.
[70:06.45]I knew you were going to go over the bridge, and now I got over the bridge.
[70:09.51]The village of Quind seems to be flourishing.
[70:12.07]The fields and orchids are humming with activity with filled sacks of grain and dying meat, testifying to the productivity of the village's cropland and pastureland.
[70:22.28]You remember that this village and the surrounding lands belong to Harald of Kingdom of Nords.
[70:29.58]Indifferent.
[70:29.92]Recruit volunteers.
[70:30.56]Go to the village center.
[70:31.16]Buy supplies from the peasants.
[70:31.84]Take a hostile action.
[70:32.84]Why would I do that?
[70:35.95]Recruit volunteers.
[70:38.27]Four Nord recruits volunteer to follow you for 40 dinars.
[70:43.36]Okay.
[70:44.50]That's fine.
[70:45.38]That's not that expensive.
[70:49.50]So I got four... Okay, go... go to the village center.
[70:59.44]I need to buy shit.
[71:00.46]Where are my friends?
[71:04.80]Can I fucking run people over accidentally?
[71:11.38]Good day, sir.
[71:13.34]What can you tell me about the village?
[71:14.39]How is life here?
[71:15.11]What is your trade?
[71:15.91]What is the latest room?
[71:16.65]What's your trade?
[71:18.95]I tend cattle.
[71:20.19]We dry and soak to preserve it.
[71:22.43]And send the hides to towns to be made into leather.
[71:25.16]We also make cheese from the milk.
[71:28.17]What can you tell me about this village?
[71:29.89]This is the village of Quinn, sir.
[71:31.77]Our village and the surrounding lands belong to Jarl Harald of Kingdom of Nords.
[71:35.84]We mostly produce pork, chicken, beef, grain, grapes, dried meat, smoked fish, hides, and flax bundle here.
[71:41.18]If you'd like to learn more, you can speak with our village elder.
[71:43.78]He's nearby, round over there.
[71:46.87]Hmm?
[71:49.81]By the way, sir, why the fuck are you looking at a wall?
[71:51.85]I'm sorry, I'm sorry, excuse me.
[72:09.09]This is the trade screen!
[72:10.19]Hold down control key while clicking on an item to quickly purchase or sell it.
[72:15.04]I got like mushrooms and shit over here.
[72:16.86]Meat, I know it's meat and I know it's broccoli.
[72:19.04]Give me a fucking break.
[72:20.12]Alright.
[72:21.84]Uh, these suck.
[72:24.74]Uh, do they have money?
[72:27.24]They don't have any money.
[72:33.70]They don't have a single cent, why would I do this?
[72:38.32]trade with the peasants you mean give to the peasants is what you meant to say buy food dried meat plus five but I need I gotta get rid of some of these t-shirts you know speaking of t-shirts
[73:05.62]If I were to wear a shirt, it wouldn't be one of these.
[73:08.26]It would be an officially licensed Jerma985 outerwear.
[73:14.15]The Night Sky and Gloom Man has returned.
[73:17.71]Check it out at the Teespring store.
[73:19.29]Only on the Teespring store.
[73:27.17]Giving them shirts decreases meat price.
[73:29.99]What?
[73:34.11]Buying price is 85.
[73:37.34]Eighty-five.
[73:37.78]That's a lie, lie, lie, lie, lie!
[73:44.86]Well... I wanna... I'm buying dried meat.
[73:47.77]I'm gonna buy the dried meat.
[73:51.81]And this is beef.
[73:53.17]Tuna.
[73:54.73]And flax.
[73:57.69]Get the fucking beef.
[73:58.48]Fifty out of fifty.
[73:59.58]I'm gonna need it, right?
[74:01.14]Smoked fish.
[74:01.78]I wanna have a lot of food.
[74:04.58]Okay.
[74:05.74]How much do I pay?
[74:06.40]228 denners?
[74:09.02]How do I phonetically pronounce this game?
[74:13.58]Food can spoil.
[74:14.38]Well, then take it back.
[74:15.30]Take one of the fish back.
[74:17.51]Take the beef back, too.
[74:18.93]Smoked fish and dried meat.
[74:22.37]Spell it out phonetically.
[74:24.35]Danar?
[74:25.87]Fish doesn't spoil.
[74:27.91]Well, I'll take the fish.
[74:30.55]Smoke fish doesn't spoil you idiot Listen, I I just bought a bunch of food and everybody tell me nobody said it They just said you guys just said food spoils not everything but fish just but I don't know what this game Classifies as being spoiled.
[74:45.72]Yes.
[74:45.92]I know you can have smoke fish in your fucking closet for like 30 years and you can still eat it But it's a video game and you guys just said it all spoils.
[74:53.44]What am I supposed to say?
[74:54.40]What am I supposed to think?
[75:00.91]Okay.
[75:02.21]I could keep the rocks.
[75:04.81]I have meat now.
[75:05.77]Alright.
[75:07.81]Leave.
[75:08.57]So I got a troop.
[75:09.35]How many people?
[75:09.89]Can I give my characters stuff?
[75:15.33]Where do these guys get stuff?
[75:16.73]Ooh, I've got fucking points to put in.
[75:23.17]Why haven't you played this game before, you idiot?
[75:29.01]I haven't read the book yet.
[75:30.51]I haven't seen the movie yet.
[75:31.41]Don't tell me how the movie ends.
[75:36.32]I need... Strength.
[75:42.56]Or intelligence.
[75:48.55]Now we can read the book.
[75:49.25]$50.
[75:49.27]$50 just came in.
[75:51.39]No, seriously, $50 did just come in.
[75:56.43]Atrolux, Atrox, thanks for the 50 bucks.
[75:58.81]Jerma missed my last 50- Oh my fucking god, how did I do that?
[76:02.16]Oh, it's because of the fucking goddamn machinery on that Twitch TV connecting to Streamlabs.
[76:08.42]Atrolux gave $100.
[76:13.07]Thank you for the $100, Atrolux.
[76:18.73]And they said, I drew this before you enabled MonkaS.
[76:24.60]I don't have... I don't think I have MonkaS enabled.
[76:29.01]And that is a broken link.
[76:30.91]That link doesn't work.
[76:31.65]I'm sorry, the link doesn't work.
[76:37.63]But thank you.
[76:39.51]And you said you're coming in here to drop funding for German Rumble Live 2.
[76:42.15]Thanks for keeping me entertained throughout the weeks.
[76:44.73]Also, here's some artwork.
[76:45.75]Is this link... That one... Oh, that link works.
[76:48.77]Look at that.
[76:49.09]Look at that fucking artwork.
[76:53.50]That's good shit.
[76:55.72]Everybody loves Shito.
[76:56.76]Shito emote is incoming, by the way.
[77:02.44]But thanks for the artwork.
[77:03.19]It's wonderful.
[77:04.53]And thanks for the hundred fucking bucks.
[77:07.07]It's a lot of money.
[77:07.75]Thank you so much.
[77:11.67]Funding for German Rumble Live 2, which will be live on Twitch at some point in the course of my online career.
[77:20.12]I promise you.
[77:20.84]It'll happen at some point.
[77:22.74]It will happen.
[77:23.69]Guaranteed.
[77:24.29]Anybody know anything about robotics?
[77:28.67]What were we doing?
[77:35.33]Throwing.
[77:35.83]Okay.
[77:37.05]Power throw.
[77:39.45]I can't... Okay, right.
[77:47.54]I need to get this at least higher than...
[77:50.03]Crossbows.
[77:54.74]And now I'm going to do... Somebody said, do leadership, idiot, stupid, dumb idiot.
[78:01.70]And I was like, whoa, jeez, man, slow down.
[78:10.55]And then surgery.
[78:11.83]4% chance that a mortally wounded struck member will be wounded by the killed party skill.
[78:17.23]Yeah, we'll do that.
[78:23.24]Okay.
[78:23.78]So I got five people.
[78:27.01]Now let's read the book.
[78:32.49]How the fuck do I read the book?
[78:34.55]Camp?
[78:35.13]Camp.
[78:36.86]You set up camp.
[78:37.48]What do you want to do?
[78:38.10]Take an action.
[78:39.86]Here we go.
[78:40.34]Select a book to retire from.
[78:42.34]I'm done.
[78:43.72]You know, I killed a few bandits.
[78:46.84]I made four friends.
[78:47.88]That's enough.
[78:49.77]Select a book to read.
[78:51.65]The De Re Militari.
[78:55.15]You start reading De Re Militari after a few pages you feel you could learn a lot from this book.
[78:59.27]You decide to keep it close by and read whenever you have time.
[79:04.52]Bullshit.
[79:08.98]That's pretty realistic, though.
[79:12.66]Instead of reading the book, everybody does that.
[79:15.44]You know, I'm gonna start A Song of Ice and Fire.
[79:17.38]Book one, A Game of Thrones.
[79:19.41]Yeah, I've heard so much about this series.
[79:21.51]You open up, like, you read four pages.
[79:24.53]Okay, that was cool.
[79:25.43]I'll do it, you know, I'll read that probably tomorrow night before I go to bed.
[79:28.60]And the book goes in your shelf for like six months.
[79:31.24]And then anybody that ever asks you, oh, hey, dude, I heard you were reading Game of Thrones.
[79:35.25]Yeah, dude, it's fucking crazy.
[79:36.35]It's really, really good.
[79:37.27]You know, I'm smart.
[79:38.15]I read.
[79:39.27]It's a great book so far.
[79:40.55]I'm like, it's really long, so it's taking me a while to get through.
[79:42.55]But gosh, man, is it cool.
[79:44.59]I like that.
[79:44.91]You know, I really like how it started.
[79:46.25]I was a big fan of how it started.
[79:57.47]You start reading, after a few pages you feel like you learn a lot.
[80:00.94]Keep it close by.
[80:01.82]Alright.
[80:11.90]Wait here for some time.
[80:13.91]For what?
[80:15.21]I will drink from your skull!
[80:18.65]I'm never listening to somebody in chat ever again.
[80:20.59]Literally never again.
[80:24.36]Like, for the rest of my life.
[80:34.10]I think I can handle this.
[80:35.24]I got rocks.
[80:35.62]So this is just like sacrifice two people to leave.
[80:38.64]That's such bullshit.
[81:10.42]As the party member with the highest tactics skill, you devise a plan that will allow you and your men to escape with your lives, but you'll have to leave one soldier behind to stop the enemy from giving chase.
[81:22.46]One guy.
[81:27.55]I'm gonna be drawing straws.
[81:32.47]Oh, I got the long one, thank God.
[81:34.25]Ooh, that's the short one.
[81:36.65]Sorry, Dan.
[81:38.41]Fuck!
[81:45.38]You tell one of your troops to hold the enemy while you retreat with the rest.
[81:49.96]Alright, now where the hell are we going?
[81:55.14]I need five people, so we're gonna go... Can I get somebody in the castle?
[82:04.75]Or should I go to Gel BG?
[82:10.61]Party.
[82:11.92]First aid.
[82:12.68]Surgery.
[82:13.50]Wound treatment.
[82:15.33]Looting.
[82:17.83]Nord Recruit.
[82:22.39]Okay.
[82:22.99]How do I... Weekly wage is $2.
[82:25.76]That's horrible.
[82:29.08]How do I equip these people?
[82:31.34]Do I not...
[82:40.19]party skills you do not you don't equip them okay okay let's have a discussion your orders sir tell me about yourself all right sir let me tell you all there is to know about me okay 50 50 50 50 50. this is kind of cool okay what if you have like 5 000 people
[83:07.78]He's stronger than me.
[83:09.44]Don't ever say that in my ranks.
[83:10.76]Alright, we're going to go to... I'm going to save the game.
[83:17.18]And then we're going to go to... Jail Veggie.
[83:22.59]Let's go.
[83:25.57]Watch it, watch it, watch it.
[83:26.41]Looters.
[83:30.41]You just have to avoid people.
[83:38.06]Sea Raider, 11.
[83:40.30]Okay.
[83:41.22]The village of Jalbegi seems to be flourishing.
[83:43.11]The fields and orchids are humming with activity.
[83:45.39]We already read this.
[83:48.27]Okay, recruit volunteers.
[83:50.77]Five Nord recruits volunteer to follow you.
[83:53.19]Sure, take them all.
[83:54.31]Now I got nine.
[83:54.85]What have we got for supplies here?
[84:01.34]Ooh, grapes.
[84:04.16]Cabbage and wool.
[84:07.32]Do you have money?
[84:07.86]None of you motherfuckers have any money.
[84:13.58]Dried meat, fish.
[84:14.66]Oh yeah, I only eat one smoked fish.
[84:20.53]I have to go to towns to sell.
[84:24.33]I wish I sold the horse.
[84:25.29]Here, have this.
[84:27.29]Rusty sword.
[84:30.15]But that doesn't matter, I'm a fucking rock thrower anyways.
[84:32.22]Alright, I got the troops I needed, right?
[84:38.32]Collect five men.
[84:40.54]Collect at least five men from nearby villages, and you collect these men, find and speak with him.
[84:44.41]He is in the tavern at Sargoth.
[84:47.31]I got nine.
[84:47.87]Let's fucking go.
[85:00.17]Whoa, I went right through the middle there.
[85:04.78]Hostile action?
[85:05.48]No, not yet.
[85:07.99]Once I have like 200 people on my team, I will burn a town to the ground.
[85:14.57]Looters, looters, looters.
[85:18.25]They don't seem to give a shit.
[85:21.21]Alright, here we go.
[85:26.78]Uh, enter the arena.
[85:27.98]Go to the marketplace.
[85:30.70]Let me sell some shit.
[85:31.66]Marketplace.
[85:33.14]You have run into a trap.
[85:34.16]You are attacked by a group of... What?
[85:38.85]The fuck are you talking about?
[85:46.78]Who is shooting?
[85:47.62]Fucking the rocks suck.
[85:56.68]Is there somebody in the window?
[85:57.82]He's right there.
[86:22.85]Alright, alright, easy.
[86:23.63]Alright, hit him right in the fucking head with a rock.
[86:26.99]Fuck.
[86:31.63]Got him.
[86:33.25]Jesus.
[86:53.37]I have a sword.
[86:53.91]I'm trying to level up my rocks.
[86:57.67]Any proficiency in rock throwing?
[87:27.08]Did I lose... How much did I lose?
[87:32.62]What did they take?
[87:35.14]They didn't take anything.
[87:39.75]They didn't... Everything.
[87:40.83]This bloke doesn't have anything on him.
[87:45.11]This guy sucks.
[87:47.63]They took 60 cents.
[87:49.19]Well, fuck them.
[87:49.89]Whatever.
[87:51.63]At least I leveled up rock throwing.
[87:55.41]Okay, can I go to the marketplace?
[87:58.06]Thank you.
[87:59.44]Trade with the arms, trade with the armor, trade with the good, trade with the armor merchant.
[88:04.46]Alright, I got some shit for you here.
[88:15.79]Are those better?
[88:17.35]Oh fuck, these are better than what I have on.
[88:25.01]They took the arrows back.
[88:27.08]So is it worth me going to the arms guy and... What do you got here?
[88:31.02]Thick gauntlets.
[88:31.66]Do you have any... Wait, do you have cool, like, better rocks?
[88:37.96]Because this is just stones.
[88:39.66]Can I throw, like, quartz at people eventually?
[88:42.25]Can I get better rocks?
[88:44.77]Just do it.
[88:45.15]Is there only one rock in the game?
[88:52.37]900 bucks.
[88:52.71]I don't have enough of that.
[89:00.50]Okay, I need a hat though.
[89:01.32]How much is this?
[89:01.84]8?
[89:02.18]That's it?
[89:02.80]20 plus 4 plus 9.

[89:20.50]I'll take that.
[89:21.00]5 to leg armor plus 14.
[89:28.82]Uh, what do we got here?
[89:30.74]Plus 24 to body armor.
[89:34.08]Eh.
[89:40.56]Should I get, uh... Plus 45 to body armor and plus 10 to leg armor.
[89:46.15]This is too expensive, though.
[89:49.55]Holy shit, $18,000?
[89:50.57]20 grand?
[89:52.21]I'm never gonna have that much money.
[89:53.31]Alright, that's fine.
[89:57.83]Uh, what else can I give you?
[89:58.57]I'll take this.
[90:01.22]Battered Old Shield.
[90:04.54]How's my reading progress 0%?
[90:05.70]I didn't even- I opened it up and- I really didn't do anything.
[90:14.84]Okay.
[90:15.48]So that's uh, you've received 18 bucks.
[90:17.04]What about the Arms Merchant?
[90:25.26]Looking for throwing.
[90:29.20]Warspear.
[90:32.47]Throwing Axe.
[90:33.65]Perfect.
[90:34.09]Okay.
[90:34.29]That's four of them.
[90:37.53]I have Power Throw 3.
[90:38.37]Ranged.
[90:38.67]42 cents.
[90:41.85]Swing.
[90:42.21]It's 32 cents to swing this.
[90:43.23]$3,400.
[90:43.27]Sell the book.
[90:43.67]Sell the book?! !
[90:59.59]Everyone was screaming at me to get enough intelligence to read it in the first place.
[91:08.39]I don't have enough money for any of this.
[91:09.59]I have my rocks and my rusty sword.
[91:14.39]One guy said that.
[91:16.24]No.
[91:16.88]Okay.
[91:18.00]Assess the local prices.
[91:23.20]Trying to work out the best deals.
[91:27.15]Okay, let's go to the tavern, right?
[91:30.47]As the party member with the highest trade skill, you try to figure out the best goods to trade in.
[91:34.72]Unable to find any trade goods that would bring a profit.
[91:37.96]Alright, head back.
[91:38.42]We go to the tavern.
[91:41.40]There he is, right?
[91:42.16]Where is he?
[91:42.40]He said, meet me at the tavern, right?
[91:50.97]He's in the tavern at Sargoth.
[91:52.33]I don't remember what the fuck this guy looks like.
[91:57.10]There he is.
[92:00.00]Splendid!
[92:01.18]You've hired enough men to take on the bandits, now travelers.
[92:04.58]Entering Sargoth had told us there's a small group of robbers lurking on the outside of town.
[92:10.18]I suspect that they are all from the same band, the one that took my brother.
[92:15.10]Hunt them down and defeat them, then make them disclose the location of their lair.
[92:19.90]I could have done that voice for fucking Red Dead 2.
[92:30.43]I do consulting work if you fucking wonder in Rockstar.
[92:35.81]Okay, very well.
[92:36.65]I will hunt the bandits.
[92:37.51]Why don't you come with us?
[92:45.92]I mean, should I bring them with us?
[92:52.01]So just go hunt the bandits.
[92:59.15]Let's go.
[93:05.11]New quest taken.
[93:05.69]Learn where the hostages are held.
[93:09.47]You got it.
[93:10.97]I need, like, ale.
[93:12.69]I need something.
[93:14.86]I'd like to buy every man who comes in here tonight a jar of your best wine.
[93:22.54]Of course, my lord.
[93:23.32]I reckon a thousand denners would be enough.
[93:26.51]What should I tell the lads?
[93:28.72]actually uh oops let me just pull them up put my hands in my pockets and open them up inside out like this and go whoopsie daisy uh I should leave what about this fine cheese so outskirts of town throw a few rocks you got it

[94:12.22]Oh, is it a pig?
[94:17.86]Tools?
[94:18.40]Tools?
[94:19.32]No.
[94:22.86]You heal automatically over time.
[94:24.78]Alright, I'm ready.
[94:26.92]Leave.
[94:27.98]Looking for the outskirts.
[94:29.00]The band of robbers.
[94:31.24]That's them, right?
[94:36.34]Find and defeat a group of bandits lurking near Sargoth.
[94:40.26]I think that's them.
[94:43.88]What do you want?
[94:45.50]I've been looking for you.
[94:46.60]Tell me where you keep your prisoners and I'll let you go.
[94:49.87]Ha!
[94:50.39]I spread the rolling off really better, eh?
[94:52.43]Did you email yourself up?
[94:54.51]No, but I brought steel.
[94:56.81]You've encountered a band of robbers.
[94:58.07]You have nine troops against their four.
[95:01.19]Charge the enemy.
[95:05.99]Charge!
[95:06.69]This is cool.
[95:07.35]Alright, I got rocks.
[95:12.95]I want to run in with my friends.
[95:14.07]I will use conflicting fire!
[95:21.05]That's not going to work, is it?
[95:27.34]How do I run?
[95:32.40]Press F keys for commands.
[95:35.94]Follow me.
[95:38.10]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[95:39.49]Charge, charge, charge.
[95:40.51]I hit the guy in the chest.
[95:50.39]Get him!
[95:52.54]Excellent work, man.
[95:58.43]The battle has been won.
[96:01.65]No casualties.
[96:02.75]Three looters, three killed.
[96:03.90]Robber, one wounded.
[96:05.00]Total, four killed.
[96:05.98]Three killed, one wounded.
[96:15.64]I'll spare you life, but in exchange, I want information.
[96:18.62]Either you or your mates kidnapped the brother of a prominent merchant in town.
[96:22.65]Tell me where you're hiding him, and give me your word that you'll stop troubling the people of these parts, and you can go free.
[96:30.01]Oh, did you like that, mate?
[96:30.95]That was a little, uh, I played it on me flute.
[96:33.05]Bless you, sir.
[96:34.35]We've done the lad no harm.
[96:35.97]We've been keeping him in our hideout now, and been.
[96:38.75]I'll describe the area nearby in detail, so there's no mistaking.
[96:45.34]And now give me your clothes!
[96:47.58]Like in Terminator.
[96:48.46]Ooh.
[96:51.72]I don't know.
[96:53.80]Just... 24... It's a coat?
[97:01.17]You got any money?
[97:01.95]Alright.
[97:06.29]Attack the bandit lair.
[97:08.67]Find the bandit lair near Ambien and free the brother of the merchant of Sargoth Merchant.
[97:15.54]What?
[97:16.80]Find the bandit lair near Ambien and free the brother of the merchant of Sargoth Merchant.
[97:24.41]Okay, it's a lair near Ambien.
[97:27.05]Ambien, the village of Ambien near Sargoth, belongs to Jarl Torigor of Kingdom of Nords.
[97:31.59]Its property is rich.
[97:34.11]Other pages that think here.
[97:35.89]Attack the bandit lair.
[97:36.77]Okay, so we've got to go to the lair around Ambien.
[97:40.63]Now, where the fuck is that?
[97:44.39]Ambien.
[97:45.07]There's Ambien.
[97:47.43]Kidnapper's Hideout.
[97:49.87]Ooh, this is going to be fun.
[97:50.53]So, we're going to go there.
[97:55.65]Let's go.
[97:56.05]No!
[98:01.92]I didn't save it.
[98:19.08]As the party member with the highest tactics skill, one, you devise a plan that will allow you and your men to escape with your lives.
[98:28.69]This is, but this kind of plan, okay, this is like, we're all idiots.
[98:33.49]And I'm the one guy that, okay, this is like going to recess.
[98:36.89]And it's like the fourth, fifth, and sixth graders are outside.
[98:40.63]And everybody listens to the sixth grader that wants to play like the Nerf football game.
[98:44.81]And he makes up the rules.
[98:47.38]Just because they just happen to be in the sixth grade.
[98:49.79]That's what this is.
[98:53.11]If you're in the fourth grade, sorry, you don't get to make the rules.
[98:54.95]You have to listen to the rules made up by the sixth grader.
[98:58.83]I'm the sixth grader in this case.
[99:00.76]So one person has to stay back and die.
[99:03.04]Go on.
[99:04.64]You tell one of your troops to hold the enemy while you... I can't pick who it is.
[99:17.13]Morale.
[99:17.73]We're fine.
[99:20.39]Alright, we're gonna go to Ambien.
[99:22.95]What's this?
[99:23.79]Six plus five plus one.
[99:27.21]Is one of them pregnant?
[99:28.69]I don't understand.
[99:30.30]Five and one's expecting!
[99:31.48]But how the fuck do I get over here?
[99:40.88]Looters?
[99:44.58]I could probably take them.
[99:46.96]Hold on a minute.
[99:47.48]Wait.
[99:49.40]I didn't level up.
[99:53.24]Click on the party tab.
[99:56.76]Seven plus.
[99:58.22]One ready to be upgraded.
[100:02.48]Upgrade to Huntsman or Footman.
[100:07.66]Uh.
[100:09.20]What's better?
[100:12.34]Twenty days.
[100:14.24]Nord Footman.
[100:15.66]Oh, alright.
[100:18.41]What about me?
[100:27.11]Can I kick myself out of my own gang?
[100:31.75]Alright, we've got a footman around here.
[100:34.03]I don't want to fucking fight this guy.
[100:36.67]Is there a quicksave?
[100:37.31]Alright, kidnapper's hideout.
[100:45.90]I'm a footman.
[100:46.78]No, you're not.
[100:52.49]Kidnapper's Hideout.
[100:55.25]You approach the hideout, the looters don't appear to have spotted you yet, and you can still sneak away unnoticed.
[101:03.62]The difficult approach to the site Down a Narrow Defile means that only a handful of troops in your party will be able to join the attack, and they will be unable to bring their horses.
[101:12.90]If your initial attack fails, the looters will easily be able to make their escape and disperse.
[101:18.21]Do you wish to attack the hideout or wait for another occasion?
[101:23.20]Uh... There, I- what- what do we do?
[101:29.36]Other occasion.
[101:30.32]Just leave.
[101:36.33]No, let's get the fuck in there.
[101:44.67]Get out of my way!
[101:45.27]Alright, let's, uh... Follow me!
[101:47.59]Everybody follow me!
[101:52.07]Oh, that's my footman!
[101:53.67]You can tell because he's wearing a blue shirt now.
[101:57.33]Can they fall off and die here?
[101:59.15]I hope not.
[102:07.46]What are these boats?
[102:08.48]Alright.
[102:09.10]Where do we go?
[102:10.98]Where's the hideout?
[102:17.85]Okay, the hideout's over there.
[102:18.75]But wait.
[102:19.43]Is there supplies over here?
[102:21.64]Everybody follow me.
[102:33.23]Man, that's just a set piece.
[102:38.73]Watch out for the fire.
[102:39.99]Don't go in the fire.
[102:41.43]Who's that?
[102:41.87]Who's that?
[102:42.65]Who's that?
[102:43.23]Who's that?
[102:45.74]Get him!
[102:46.16]Get him!
[102:55.87]Okay, good work!
[103:00.35]Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me.
[103:02.31]Fall back!
[103:02.75]No, no, no, don't go in the water!
[103:03.91]What are you, fucking lemmings?
[103:04.93]Get over here!
[103:08.76]No, no, follow me.
[103:23.06]Here comes the fight.
[103:25.65]Yeah, use your, like, fucking dinner plate.
[103:30.09]You made that out of cardboard.
[103:31.25]That shit's not gonna stop anything.
[103:33.74]Just looks cool.
[103:34.50]Alright, I'm thinking wrap around here.
[103:59.23]Alright, now everybody spread out!
[104:03.25]No, I mean, uh... Advance!
[104:08.61]Spread out!
[104:21.33]Oh, I got him, I got him, I got him.
[104:22.77]Oh, that guy's throwing rocks too!
[104:39.83]He's gonna cut me!
[104:42.39]Somebody help me!
[104:43.55]Help!
[104:46.12]Okay, we're good.
[104:49.88]Okay.
[104:50.82]Hold your... Follow me.
[104:56.28]Found the hideout, right?
[105:05.69]Uh... No, we didn't?
[105:09.14]We can't go in there?
[105:16.87]Charge.
[105:19.19]Where are we charging to?
[105:20.57]Where are they going?
[105:33.34]Damn it.
[105:37.56]Backspace shows a mini-map.
[105:39.02]Oh my god, that's very helpful.
[105:51.67]We did it.
[105:55.81]Who the fuck are you?
[105:57.13]Oh.
[105:59.25]Thank you, thank you, sir, for rescuing me from those fiends!
[106:02.17]Did my brother and Sargoth put you onto their track?
[106:06.50]Yes, I told them that I would find you.
[106:07.86]I advise you to return to your family as quickly as you can and be careful on that road.
[106:12.84]With their retreat cut off, the looters fall one by one to your determined attack.
[106:16.98]Their hideout and their ill-gotten gains are now yours.
[106:22.58]Ooh.
[106:24.05]Look it up.
[106:25.11]Rock.
[106:25.43]A lot of nice hats, too.
[106:29.39]Hold on.
[106:29.73]Fuck.
[106:36.10]Was that granite?
[106:36.81]Or is that, uh... Cement.
[106:43.39]Whatever.
[106:43.71]I gotta sell these.
[106:47.09]Uh, Falchions.
[106:51.84]Alright, this is... 8 to body armor.
[106:53.98]How much space do I have?
[106:55.66]Look at all this shit.
[106:57.44]I have so many, like, fishing knives.
[107:00.03]This is just like the Showtime knife set by fucking Ron Papil.
[107:02.87]These things are terrible.
[107:05.66]Hold on a minute here.
[107:07.92]That's not to say that the Showtime knife set is not a high-quality knife set.
[107:12.37]Because it is.
[107:13.53]Showtime, Rotisserie, I mean, Ron Papil makes some great products.
[107:16.91]I didn't want to make anyone think that I thought that he didn't.
[107:27.08]Diamond Rocks.
[107:33.11]Just pick up the most expensive shit.
[107:35.65]Yeah.
[107:36.09]That's pretty much all I can get.
[107:42.81]What did I pick up?
[107:43.53]What dumb shit did I pick up here?
[107:47.03]Get fucking rid of this.
[107:47.97]Sell price 12.
[107:48.47]Sell price 12.
[107:49.03]57, 57, 57, 16.
[107:49.11]16, 16.
[107:49.15]70, 75.
[107:49.19]57.
[107:49.21]I'll take one more.
[108:05.25]So we did it.
[108:06.69]Attack the bandit lair.
[108:08.77]The quest has been successfully completed.
[108:10.20]Talk to the merchant of Sargoth to claim your reward.
[108:13.62]Did I level up at all?
[108:15.68]I didn't even level up from that?
[108:17.74]I don't even like this game.
[108:19.04]I'm pretending to like it.
[108:20.22]Alright, let's go with 20 days footman and huntsman.
[108:28.76]I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.
[108:29.82]This game is very fun.
[108:34.53]I'm kidding, my god!
[108:35.85]What, I'm not allowed to have a little fun?
[108:39.03]Alright, let's go... gotta go to Sargoth.
[108:46.61]Save this fucking game.
[108:51.03]I thought this game was like a strategy game.
[108:53.19]I didn't know it was like this.
[108:56.49]I think every screenshot and every piece of video clip I've ever seen of this game was like this.
[109:02.57]Let's take a click here.
[109:04.21]Eight versus your five.
[109:05.35]I win.
[109:06.20]I didn't know it was this fun.
[109:21.22]Jeremy, you were just using strategy commands in-game.
[109:24.74]Yeah, but it's different, though.
[109:26.86]In-game, real-time strategy, right?
[109:29.76]RTS is what it's called.
[109:34.47]real-time, in-game strategy.
[109:38.95]Why are you going so slow?
[109:41.29]What's wrong with you?
[109:41.93]Hurry up.
[109:44.83]Why are you going so slow?
[109:50.94]Hurry the fuck up.
[109:54.90]It's nighttime?
[109:57.22]That means you ride slower?
[109:58.86]Whoa, look at that.
[109:59.72]That guy had 51 people in his party.
[110:01.70]I can't wait to fucking slaughter that guy.
[110:04.92]All right, so we're going to go to the, um, marketplace.
[110:09.54]See if we can get the armor guy to take some of this stuff off of our hands.
[110:13.24]This is 14, 12, 12, 12.
[110:15.26]None of this.
[110:15.60]Get rid of all of it.
[110:16.26]Uh, what else we got?
[110:19.58]This is dumb, shitty, stupid.
[110:22.36]All right, that's good.
[110:28.44]Let's go to the arms merchant.
[110:29.74]I got some stuff for you here.
[110:33.21]I thought they said they were selling for like 75.
[110:42.19]Wait, maybe I should... I could put one of these on.
[110:44.12]Rusty Sword.
[110:45.56]Versus... Rusty Chipped.
[110:49.46]It's just a regular Falchion.
[110:50.60]Okay.
[110:53.20]98 weapon reach, 73 of Christ Strength, 8.
[110:55.48]How can you tell how much damage it does?
[110:56.84]24 versus 19?
[110:57.56]I guess... 30? 30?
[111:08.54]Anything has to be better than a rusty sword.
[111:10.00]All right, so 18, 18, 18, 18.
[111:10.94]I got plenty of food.
[111:15.24]All right, let's go to the tavern and complete the quest.
[111:29.39]Did your brother come in yet?
[111:32.57]Well, my brother is home safe.
[111:33.88]I'm not sure what to do with him.
[111:35.50]Maybe pack him off to a university outside Calradia.
[111:39.34]That way, if he gets knocked on the head in a street brawl, no one can say it's my fault.
[111:44.40]But that's not your problem.
[111:45.44]Here's the rest of your reward.
[111:46.40]It was well earned.
[111:49.49]The banks, man.
[111:51.45]Oh, the money is most welcome, and I'm glad to have been of service.
[111:54.77]The banks.
[111:56.03]Good.
[111:56.29]Now are you interested in making some more?
[111:57.41]Yeah.
[111:57.53]What do you got?
[112:00.73]remember how I told you that the bandits had an ally inside the walls I think I know who that is the captain of the watch no less some months ago the captain seeking the amount of profit we merchants were making from trade across the frontiers decided to borrow some money to sponsor a caravan
[112:21.63]Unfortunately, like many who are new to commerce, he failed to realize that great profit only comes with great risk.
[112:27.60]So he sank all of his money into the most expensive commodities and of course his caravan was captured and looted and he lost everything.
[112:39.11]As a consequence, it seems our captain turned to villainy to recoup his fortune.
[112:44.61]I supposed I'd do the same if, the heavens forbid, I ever faced indebtedness and ruination.
[112:50.68]Now any watch captain worth his salary will have a few thieves and robbers on his payroll.
[112:56.92]To inform on the rest, but our captain decides to employ these bandits wholesale.
[113:01.78]He brings them into the town, lets them do as they will, and takes a share of their take.
[113:06.36]You've heard of poachers turning gamekeepers.
[113:09.24]Well, in the most unfortunate land of Calradia, sometimes gamekeepers will turn poacher.
[113:15.65]Luckily, there's still a few brave, honest souls in the Watch who've told me how he works.
[113:23.51]Now, here's my plan.
[113:26.21]I could bring this to the attention of King Ragnar, lord of the city, but that would mean an inquiry, my word against the captains.
[113:35.71]And when this can be brought to evidence destroyed, oh, maybe the whole thing will be forgotten.
[113:41.77]If the enemy comes across the border again, and all I'll get for my trouble is a knife in the ribs.
[113:48.45]In time of war, you see a king's eye wanders far from his domain.
[113:53.05]and the subjects suffer.
[113:54.89]So I've got another idea.
[113:56.63]I've got a small group of townsfolk together, some men in my employ, and some others who've lost relatives to these bandits, and we'll storm the captain's home and bring him in chains before King Ragnar, hopefully with a few captured bandits to explain how he fucked it up so much.
[114:13.52]All I need now is someone to lead my little army into battle, and I can't think of anyone better than you, so what do you say?
[114:18.97]Yeah.
[114:21.71]How do I know that you're telling me the truth?
[114:24.56]Oh, well, I suppose it's possible that I found a dozen bandits who were willing to give their lives to give a passing stranger a false impression of life and old Stargoth.
[114:30.68]Oh, well, I guess you can't really know if my word is good, but I reckon you've learned by now that my money is good and there's another hundred enterers, or maybe a bit more, that's waiting for you if you'll do me this little last favor.
[114:40.67]So what do you say?
[114:49.13]So this could be false.
[114:57.41]Too much.
[114:59.63]No, fuck it, let's go.
[115:02.91]Splendid, it's been a long time since I staked so much on a single throw of the dice, and frankly, I find it exhilarating.
[115:08.99]My men are ready to move on your word.
[115:10.45]Are you ready?
[115:12.89]I don't want to be treated like a fucking goddamn craps table.
[115:17.49]Where's the option to fucking spin around and get him on the neck?
[115:23.95]Yes, give them the sign.
[115:28.68]Good.
[115:29.50]Now strike hard, strike fast, and the captain and his henchmen won't know what hit them.
[115:33.61]May the heavens be with you.
[115:36.69]This guy's crazy.
[115:37.79]Me?
[115:39.15]Crazy streamer.
[115:44.04]This is... I'm roleplaying.
[115:49.69]You leave the tavern and go out to the streets.
[115:51.55]Nervous-looking young men are waiting in every street corner.
[115:54.71]You can say they have daggers and clubs concealed under their clothes and catch a mixture of fear, anticipation, and pride in the quick looks that they throw at you as you pass by.
[116:06.24]Praying that your enemies have not been alarmed by this all too obvious bunch of plotters, you check your weapons for one last time and prepare yourself for the action ahead.
[116:22.19]Okay.
[116:24.41]There he is.
[116:25.19]It's time, lads!
[116:26.13]Up and at them!
[116:28.73]He's in my face!
[116:29.39]What the fuck?!
[116:39.10]This guy just has a good bat.
[116:40.48]That guy has a fucking baseball bat.
[116:49.32]That guy's like a flaming fucking plus two magic sword!
[117:04.97]Now the dogs are barking.
[117:12.37]There's one more guy?
[117:18.05]Looter killed by Lord Nord, the remaining few bandits scatter off to the town's narrow alleys, only to be hunted down one by one by the angry townsfolk.
[117:28.44]Making sure that your victory is complete, and all the wounded have been taken care of, you and the merchant head to his house to review the day's events.
[117:43.72]I don't think German could be any worse at this game.
[117:46.46]Well, here's the thing.
[117:48.86]I put all my points into throwing rocks at people.
[117:53.41]So if I was using the sword, this would probably go a lot differently, but I'm doing the throwing stuff.
[118:00.64]Why?
[118:00.98]Because 201 guys in chat told me to do it.
[118:12.25]Well done, I hear you counted for one or two of the bastards, and you're still on your feet.
[118:15.83]You can't ask for a better outcome of a battle than that.
[118:18.29]Unfortunately, about eight of my lads got themselves wounded.
[118:21.14]I should go look on them.
[118:32.56]I'm not bad at the game, I just made bad decisions.
[118:34.62]Yeah, this is the first time I've ever played it, I'm just like...
[118:38.20]You want me to do, like, the meta play?
[118:40.84]Pick, like, the best things possible in the first playthrough, first time I play the game?
[118:46.34]No, I want to throw rocks at people.
[118:52.49]I want to throw rocks at people's heads.
[118:59.09]And that's eventually going to turn into throwing axes, and that's eventually going to turn into javelins.
[119:03.47]And I will be unkillable.
[119:05.69]In about 15 minutes.
[119:17.21]Alright, I got, yeah, I killed a couple of them.
[119:19.13]Ah, well, I'm proud to have done my bit along with the rest.
[119:24.97]Yeah.
[119:26.61]Yes, yes, now a couple of my boys have the watch captain pinned down in a back room with a knife at his throat.
[119:32.52]I'll need to go drag him before King Ragnar and explain what this breach of the peace is all about.
[119:37.08]You don't need to be part of that, though.
[119:39.66]I'll tell you what.
[119:41.58]If all goes well, I'll meet you in the tavern again shortly and I'll let you know how it all came out.
[119:46.16]If you don't save,
[119:47.44]Before this encounter, you're going to be very upset.
[119:51.24]Instead of seeing my head on a spike over the city gate, I'll assume you know enough to stay out of town for a while and forget this whole episode ever happened.
[119:57.23]Hopefully we'll meet again.
[120:02.65]So this guy's dead.
[120:04.17]I mean, this guy's going to die.
[120:09.23]So he said make sure you save the game.
[120:15.04]Alright, let's go to the marketplace.
[120:20.38]Arms merchant.
[120:20.96]Alright, let me see what I got.
[120:22.80]728.
[120:23.68]Throwing axes.
[120:26.21]Don't have enough for it yet.
[120:26.97]Let's just get rid of this.
[120:42.35]War darts.
[120:43.07]Ooh.
[120:47.13]I don't have enough for the war darts.
[120:50.93]There are some war darts that hit dart.
[120:53.73]Damage 22.
[120:54.67]What is the damage 11?
[120:55.61]7 out of 7.
[120:58.53]3 out of 10.
[121:00.19]Are there even shittier darts?
[121:07.02]That's double the damage.
[121:10.88]Large bag of darts.
[121:12.22]No.
[121:12.34]No.
[121:15.68]The Bargain Bin is even lower down.
[121:17.72]What's it called?
[121:18.38]Throwing Knife?
[121:21.15]Butchering Knife?
[121:23.19]Rusty, Rusty, Club, Scythe, War Spear, Bent Bolts.
[121:35.71]Spectre Club.
[121:38.79]Just put two rocks together for x2 damage.
[121:44.88]Well, I'm gonna get these.
[121:45.66]I can just pick them up, right?
[121:58.12]There are only seven of them.
[121:59.24]Yeah, but I can get them, right?
[122:00.69]I can pick them up.
[122:03.45]And get them.
[122:11.63]Seven per battle.
[122:12.57]Okay, that's not bad.
[122:15.68]That's double the damage.
[122:16.76]I told you it was gonna take 15 minutes.
[122:19.80]Everyone was mad that I didn't get, like, Arming Sword plus 10 Strength.
[122:26.41]Now I've got... Lawn Darts.
[122:32.41]Get rid of the rocks.
[122:34.25]Ugh, but it's sentimental.
[122:45.85]Okay, that's fine.
[122:48.98]I do want... I want the throwing.
[122:49.86]Look at the damage on that shit.
[122:52.34]It's gonna be good.
[122:55.34]I will never read this book.
[122:56.34]Alright, that's alright.
[123:00.08]I got a better throwing weapon now.
[123:01.46]And I have power throw.
[123:08.30]Enter the arena.
[123:10.58]No, I'm not ready for the arena.
[123:13.86]So now, uh, I, I got nothing, right?
[123:18.12]Just kind of go.
[123:18.74]The arena is just, it's easy.
[123:25.26]Well, let's just do the arena.
[123:32.88]Hold on.
[123:36.18]Enter the arena.
[123:40.66]Good day, friend.
[123:41.24]If you come to watch the tournaments, you came in vain.
[123:43.14]There won't be a tournament here anytime soon.
[123:45.80]Tournaments?
[123:46.16]So they hold the tournaments here.
[123:47.48]Yes, that's what I just told you.
[123:49.68]You should see this place during one of the tournament fights.
[123:51.84]Everyone from this town and nearby villages comes here.
[123:54.53]The crowd becomes mad with excitement.
[123:57.29]Anyway, as I said, there won't be an event here soon, so there isn't much to see.
[124:01.45]Except as an official duel every now and then.
[124:04.13]And of course, we have melee fights every day.
[124:07.15]Tell me about them.
[124:09.42]The fighters and knights get bored waiting for the next tournament, so they have invented the training melee.
[124:14.32]It is a simple idea.
[124:15.20]Fighters jump into the arena with a weapon.
[124:17.54]There are no rules, no teams.
[124:19.10]Everyone beats at each other until there is only one fighter left standing.
[124:24.19]Okay.
[124:25.33]There is.
[124:26.97]Actually, some of the wealthy townsmen offer prizes for those fighters who show great skill in the fights.
[124:32.45]If you can beat three opponents before going down, you'll earn five dollars.
[124:37.68]That doesn't seem worth it.
[124:39.76]You'll get $10 for striking down at least 6 people, $25 if you can defeat 10, and $60 if you can survive long enough to beat 20 opponents.
[124:49.62]If you're the last man standing, you can get $250.
[124:53.84]Can I join?
[124:54.48]Uh, haha, you would have been, you would have to be out of your mind not to.
[125:01.40]The melee fights are open to all.
[125:02.50]Actually, there is one going to be, there's going to be one right now.
[125:05.00]Hop in if you'd like.
[125:05.70]Okay.
[125:06.78]Okay.
[125:13.33]I don't... I guess I can't... I don't have any... The reason why all three of you fucking... Ow.
[125:29.20]I don't have any health anyways.
[125:32.28]I have, like, no HP.
[125:48.63]Oh, he broke my... Oh, boy.
[126:05.29]No!
[126:11.86]I made some money, though, didn't I?
[126:16.26]You earned five dollars for knocking down five people.
[126:18.82]Okay.
[126:22.73]Can I do it again?
[126:23.29]Uh, there'll be a fight here soon.
[126:28.45]Cool, I'll do it again.
[126:29.15]How many does it take?
[126:38.81]I got a different weapon this time.
[126:41.93]Come on, man.
[126:42.41]What the hell?
[126:46.15]How many times do I have to fucking... Jesus.
[126:55.26]I had to hit that guy like four times.
[126:58.72]This guy's got... I'm not gonna do this.
[127:15.59]Right in the head.
[127:26.66]Watch out for the guy with the fucking sword!
[127:28.04]He's like, bounced off that wall guy.
[127:30.92]What?
[127:43.15]Ah, I was focusing on that guy.
[127:49.05]No, I'll do it one more time.
[127:50.53]I'm learning how to, like, play.
[127:54.51]He's doing easy mode auto-block.
[128:01.50]Well, alright, you want me to go... I'm not gonna turn that off.. I am... I do understand how it works, though.
[128:13.92]You have to aim in the right direction.
[128:15.23]Like, I get it.
[128:27.74]Learning manual is fun.
[128:29.08]Yeah, maybe eventually here.
[128:30.47]Not right now.
[128:32.67]That was easy.
[128:55.53]Proficiency Impulse.
[128:56.43]Yeah, I'm getting Proficiency too.
[129:06.13]Overhead Swing.
[129:06.87]Alright, that's 5.
[129:07.53]I'm gonna beat 20?
[129:09.00]Nice Devil Team.
[129:13.88]Same guy.
[129:28.58]That guy just came back from the future to, like, fucking prevent him from winning this competition.
[129:38.37]Again.
[129:52.32]So many people left.
[129:59.44]I don't want to get hit by this guy.
[130:11.43]Oh, God.
[130:11.93]Me and the fucking mountain, whatever his name is.
[130:13.83]No, this is the other one.
[130:15.39]The dog.
[130:16.35]The hound.
[130:17.66]Oh, fuck.
[130:22.14]The hound, obviously, is going to beat me.
[130:29.01]I got my ten dollars.
[130:30.41]Alright, I need to leech.
[130:33.55]That's cool.
[130:35.23]You have to sit there and do that to 30 people though.
[130:38.29]That's cool.
[130:40.93]Autoblock noob.
[130:41.93]Yeah, I just fucking downloaded the game an hour and a half ago.
[130:47.62]I was told by the tutorial.
[130:49.84]Maybe you shouldn't do this right now, lad.
[130:51.76]Maybe you should do this at a later date.
[130:56.96]Of course I'm new to the game.
[130:58.20]That's what that means.
[130:59.06]That's supposed to be an insult to me?
[131:18.79]Autoblock makes it harder.
[131:22.19]Look, I'll turn off autoblock in like an hour.
[131:27.75]So, now, what the hell am I supposed to do now?
[131:31.67]I need to go find stuff to do.
[131:36.65]I want to buy a new weapon.
[131:40.56]Nah, I was already here.
[131:41.14]I already got a new weapon.
[131:45.10]Alright, um, let's go to the tavern.
[131:50.62]Because they was like, oh, what's there to do around here, right?
[131:55.93]Have you heard of anyone in the realm who might have a job for me?
[131:59.31]King Ragnar is always looking for mercenaries to fight in the wars.
[132:02.33]Let me think.
[132:04.75]Jarl Surdan has been asking around for someone who might want work.
[132:08.19]I'd watch yourself with him, though.
[132:09.39]You may want to speak with him.
[132:10.54]Let me think.
[132:13.06]Other work.
[132:13.56]Lords and guildmasters often have other tasks which we don't hear about.
[132:16.50]The villagers around here frequently need help.
[132:20.46]Alright, I'll keep my ears open.
[132:21.58]Alright, so we got... There's...
[132:27.19]What was that guy's name?
[132:28.11]Just look at all these people's names.
[132:35.98]There's like a hundred Jarls.
[132:38.66]What was that guy's name?
[132:52.38]You got like a fucking bunch of them.
[133:00.05]It's a title.
[133:01.32]I thought it was like John Iria, John Harold, John Hader, John Gunder.
[133:18.97]Jarl.
[133:19.37]All right, what was this guy's name again?
[133:25.33]King Jarl Serdan.
[133:28.56]Thank you, I've heard enough.
[133:30.70]Where are you?
[133:31.26]Jarl, let's go find this guy.
[133:37.98]Jarl Surgeon is a vassal of King Ragnar of Kingdom of Nords.
[133:42.62]He is the lord of Buelin.
[133:46.06]Buelin.
[133:46.98]Buelin.
[133:48.58]So we're gonna go to Buelin.
[133:49.40]Where's Buelin?
[133:50.33]The village of Buelin near Chalbeck Castle belongs to Jarl.
[133:55.73]And he's rich.
[133:58.49]Okay.
[133:58.63]Okay.
[134:01.94]Chalbeck Castle.
[134:03.52]Belongs to... Okay, so we go to the village.
[134:05.70]It's... Bulien.
[134:07.53]We go to find Bulien.
[134:08.85]It's near Chalbeck Castle.
[134:23.07]That's far fucking away.
[134:25.41]So I can go here.
[134:31.24]Alright, that's just one option.
[134:32.57]Let's go kind of in the... We're like Cape Cod in Massachusetts.
[134:39.57]What are the other scenarios there?
[134:46.29]There's this merchant again.
[134:48.18]Ah!
[134:48.90]Carton!
[134:49.66]Things didn't go quite so well as I'd hoped.
[134:51.58]King Ragnar couldn't quite find it and overlooked my little breach of the peace.
[134:55.54]Oh, he's grateful enough that I got rid of his crooked captain.
[134:59.38]A guard who led in bandits will lead an enemy army if the price is right, but he can't exactly have me running around here as a lasting reminder of his failure to take care of things.
[135:08.70]That's not fair.
[135:10.12]Uh, Farel, this is Calradia, my boy.
[135:12.08]Kings do what they will, and the rest of us do as they must.
[135:15.26]He didn't string me up and instead gave me time to sell my properties, even put in a word with the other merchants that they best pay me a fair price too.
[135:24.91]Itchy nose.
[135:25.41]That's gracious enough as kings go, but he's a weak king.
[135:29.37]as they all are here, are weak kings, and weak kings must always look to their authority first and justice second.
[135:37.42]I suppose I'll do the same in his shoes.
[135:40.32]Anyway, I wouldn't go rubbing your part in this affair.
[135:45.47]That's a weird way to say that.
[135:47.77]I wouldn't go rubbing your part in King Ragnar's face.
[135:51.80]I didn't plan on it, but he's taken note of you and decided that you're not worth hanging.
[135:56.08]And that's something to which I'll raise a glass any day.
[135:59.02]He might even have work for you further down the road.
[136:02.62]Or you can sell your sword to one of his competitors.
[136:05.79]Anyway, I hope you've learned a bit about what it will take to stay alive in this troubled land, and I suspect that the money you've earned won't go to waste.
[136:11.83]Good luck.
[136:13.47]So we can go talk to the king.
[136:19.88]Let me see here.
[136:22.08]We've got characters.
[136:24.70]What's his name?
[136:25.20]King Jarl?
[136:25.82]I don't remember what his fucking name is.
[136:27.61]There it is.
[136:29.71]The ruler of the kingdom of Nords.
[136:31.81]He is the lord of Sargoth.
[136:33.55]The last time you saw him, King Ragnar, was at Sargoth.
[136:36.37]The report is current.
[136:37.29]So the king is here.
[136:42.30]So I can either look for the king here, find the king, do king's bidding, or...
[136:49.48]Go find Jarl.
[136:51.48]See what Jarl has to say.
[137:00.35]I mean, he's here.
[137:02.01]So, let's just find him.
[137:05.41]Castle.
[137:09.79]Uh, your castle looks like a shitty tavern.
[137:13.79]We are not supposed to talk while on guard, sir.
[137:16.81]Okay.
[137:29.14]Found you.
[137:32.94]Found you.
[137:35.78]Do I know you?
[137:37.84]My name is Carton, at your service, sir.
[137:40.98]I am King Ragnar, ruler of Kingdom of Nords, and the Lord of Sargoth.
[137:47.00]I see that you carry a nobleman's banner.
[137:49.54]Although I do not recognize the device, know that I am always looking for good men to fight for me, once they prove themselves to be worthy of my trust.
[138:02.98]My lord, I've come to offer you my sword in vassal age.
[138:08.85]You've yet to show yourself a competent commander, Cartan.
[138:12.67]Take your sword to my enemies and prove to me that you are worthy of becoming my vassal.
[138:17.13]Then we may speak more of this.
[138:20.40]Do you have any tasks for me?
[138:23.19]I need to send a letter to Jarl Aedin, who should be currently at Tyr.
[138:28.83]If you will be heading toward there, would you deliver it to him?
[138:32.55]The letter needs to be in his hands in 30 days.
[138:37.85]Certainly.
[138:38.41]I intend to pass by Tyr, and it would be no trouble.
[138:42.99]OK.
[138:50.58]At Tyr.
[138:51.78]Absolutely.
[138:53.93]I appreciate it, Carlton.
[138:55.73]Here's the letter and a small sum to cover your travel expenses.
[138:59.43]Give my regards to Jarl Aedan.
[139:02.31]Then you see.
[139:02.85]Okay.
[139:11.12]So, let's take a look at the map and see what that is.
[139:12.68]Let's... Leave.
[139:18.20]You're just an errand boy.
[139:20.12]No, I'm not.
[139:20.52]Alright, we're gonna go to Tyr.
[139:25.73]Tear.
[139:27.29]Got a letter, I gotta deliver to Jarl of Tear.
[139:32.74]And I'm here, that's pretty easy.
[139:36.74]Erron boy, you're an erron boy.
[139:37.78]I'm not an erron boy!
[139:38.72]Look, you can't be king of the castle.
[139:42.86]I have to deliver letters first.
[139:49.11]Okay.
[139:55.77]So let's head out.
[139:56.61]I need to go here.
[139:57.69]Just make sure we're yet.
[139:59.53]Yeah, yeah.
[140:00.29]Was believed to be a tier when you were given this quest.
[140:02.39]You have 30 days to finish it.
[140:04.89]Let's go.
[140:09.17]Anyone wants to fuck with me?
[140:11.62]In the head you got me and my fucking boys.
[140:13.30]You know what I mean?
[140:17.30]I don't think anyone's gonna fuck with me.
[140:28.80]mail crew.
[140:30.86]Oh, look at that.
[140:31.97]By order of King Gravid, Count Loraquin of the kingdom of Rhodos has been indicted for treason.
[140:38.03]The lord has been stripped of all his properties and has fled for his life.
[140:40.11]He is rumored to have gone into exile with the kingdom of Swadia.
[140:59.09]Okay.
[141:01.91]Oh, but I've got to deliver this message.
[141:06.65]Village farmers, take all of they have and put it in my bag.
[141:13.93]No, no, no, no.
[141:14.71]Deliver, deliver, deliver, deliver.
[141:22.42]Okay.
[141:23.22]Go to the castle.
[141:24.44]Visit the tavern.
[141:25.18]Let's go.
[141:25.60]Let's deliver the note.
[141:29.23]I'm looking for Jarl of Tyr.
[141:35.14]Lady Jarl.
[141:38.26]I say, you don't look familiar.
[141:40.22]I am Carton.
[141:41.66]Carton?
[141:42.38]I do not believe I've heard of you before.
[141:45.00]Can I help you with anything?
[141:47.52]I need to know the location of someone.
[141:55.33]Very well.
[141:55.87]I may or may not have an answer for you.
[141:57.39]About whom do you wish to hear?
[141:59.73]Jarl.
[142:00.92]One of the Jarls.
[142:02.28]One of the many Jarls that you know a lot of people.
[142:07.06]You have too many friends.
[142:11.43]It was Eric?
[142:12.75]No, it wasn't Jarl.
[142:14.05]Jarl Eric.
[142:17.13]You know, one of my good friends is Jarl Eric.
[142:20.29]You know, Eric Jarl.
[142:22.36]He's such a fucking nice guy.
[142:23.92]He's such a nice dude.
[142:31.47]Oh, that one.
[142:34.98]Jarl Aedan is traveling to Tyr and he should be close to Tyr at the moment.
[142:40.18]I must beg of you, I have to leave.
[142:42.90]So you're on the way here.
[142:47.75]Stop saying Jarl Ron.
[142:50.11]Phonetically pronounce it in the chat and we'll see.
[142:57.03]There he is!
[143:00.14]Yarl.
[143:02.12]Yarl.
[143:03.56]Yarl.
[143:08.02]It's ear-all.
[143:09.70]Year-all.
[143:10.32]Year-all.
[143:10.76]Alright, I'm gonna... I'm seeing a lot of different pronunciations.
[143:17.09]Okay, so I'm gonna... You tell me with button presses which one's correct.
[143:22.75]One.
[143:24.03]Yarl.
[143:25.81]Two.
[143:26.09]Year-all.
[143:28.35]Three.
[143:30.78]Yarrel.
[143:36.78]So it's one, okay.
[143:37.82]I got it.
[143:39.04]There he is?
[143:39.52]No, it's not him.
[143:41.98]Where the fuck is Yarrel?
[143:48.99]He's supposed to be here.
[143:50.23]Did I co- did I- was I way too ambitious with trying to impress the king that I got here way too early?
[144:03.46]Wait here.
[144:07.30]There he is.
[144:07.66]That was him, right?
[144:10.84]Oh, that's gotta be him right here.
[144:12.07]Is that him?
[144:14.33]Which one of these is him?
[144:15.21]Now he had 68 people.
[144:23.49]He left.
[144:26.26]Uh, is there... Can I, like, stop this?
[144:33.82]I thought it said wait.
[144:35.78]I didn't know.
[144:36.96]I thought it was going to pop up after like a day or something.
[144:38.85]I didn't know it kept going.
[144:42.11]I thought it was like a scenario where like, oh, wait.
[144:44.17]Oh, you've waited for like a day and now let's go.
[144:46.03]I didn't know I could click.
[144:53.40]There he is.
[144:53.80]He's right there.
[144:54.48]Everybody relax.
[145:00.44]I got a letter for you.
[145:07.04]I don't recognize the device on your banner.
[145:08.78]No doubt another foreigner come to our lands if we didn't have so many here already.
[145:12.59]There's something which I would like to discuss with you in private.
[145:23.75]You'll have to speak to me at some other time, then.
[145:27.46]I have a letter for you.
[145:28.62]No, I don't.
[145:30.14]There's a guy... Look, there's a guy that has...
[145:32.92]The same name as you, but he has a D in his name instead.
[145:36.14]It's the wrong guy.
[145:37.00]It's this guy.
[145:45.37]Jarl Aiden.
[145:48.93]How many Jarls do you have?
[145:50.27]How many Jarls do you have in this town?
[146:01.08]He's in the field and he should be close to Izmirala Castle at the moment.
[146:06.61]Where the fuck is that?
[146:21.74]Where did he go?
[146:23.26]Izmirala Castle?
[146:40.06]Oh my god, he's all... That's not that far.
[146:42.88]Alright, if I go there and he leaves, I'm gonna be fuckin' mad.
[146:52.11]Alright, let's go.
[146:55.13]Ismarala Castle.
[146:56.51]Head out.
[146:57.65]I'm so fuckin' far away.
[146:59.57]No, just stay at tier, he's gonna come back.
[147:06.29]Who the fuck are these people?
[147:08.85]Can I like jo- how do I join the- should I- what do I do?
[147:14.56]I'm gonna stay with these guys.
[147:15.92]They're going the same place.
[147:22.45]Is there- are they fighting?
[147:25.25]Who's fighting?
[147:32.78]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[147:34.04]You come across a battle between Jarl Erik's party and looters.
[147:37.12]Move in and help his party.
[147:39.22]You're helping the Jarl party against the looters.
[147:41.78]You have 64 troops.
[147:47.85]Holy shit!
[147:48.81]Alright, hey, wait, wait.
[147:58.19]Where's my men?
[147:58.78]My men, my men, my men.
[148:01.66]Come here.
[148:07.90]Just don't get yourself hurt.
[148:09.75]We're just here for moral support.
[148:14.19]How did you let this guy get by everybody?
[148:16.17]Did that guy seriously get through?
[148:17.69]There's sixty fucking five of us.
[148:30.56]Battle one!
[148:32.86]Did I get stuff for this?
[148:35.17]Good to see you here, Cotton.
[148:38.01]We showed those bastards a thing to tear down, didn't we?
[148:42.05]Rock!
[148:43.63]Nice!
[148:51.60]What are they doing?
[148:56.58]They're, like, going in a completely opposite direction.
[148:58.43]I'm going back to tear.
[149:00.45]I just... I'm going back to tear.
[149:02.31]I'm not doing this shit.
[149:03.41]He's gonna walk by me.
[149:14.54]It's gonna take me like fucking three years to get over there.
[149:17.46]Where is he?
[149:20.38]Go and find him?
[149:23.62]No, I'm not gonna go find the guy.
[149:26.46]Hold up, I need to- Where is Aiden?
[149:29.48]He's traveling to Tyr and should be close to Ferechen at the moment.
[149:34.25]Where's Ferechen?
[149:36.05]He's coming here.
[149:36.73]I'm standing in the- I'm standing in the fucking doorway.
[149:39.97]You got food?
[149:43.62]I was... I'm not gonna just go trek into the snow with like six people.
[149:47.55]That guy's falling asleep.
[149:52.41]Alright, let's go find some more recruits.
[150:01.61]Uh, visit the tavern.
[150:02.58]Let's visit the tavern.
[150:05.48]I want recruits.
[150:11.32]Recruit?
[150:13.39]Hello, Beth.
[150:13.71]I'm looking at you.
[150:14.11]I'd say you're expecting to get into some fights in the near future.
[150:16.28]Are you by any chance looking for some help?
[150:18.92]Mm-hmm.
[150:20.93]Well sir as long as I can remember I've had a weakness for pretty things and it's gotten me into trouble you see.
[150:24.93]I grew up in Malia castle as a bonded servant working alongside my mother in the kitchens I would just amuse myself by hunting mice through the pantries and sculleries.
[150:32.00]I was so gutted that I put the castle cats out of a job and eventually the lord realized that I might also be employed to track down bigger gain on certain errands of a type perhaps better left unsaid.
[150:43.00]Uh, needless to say I found a number of opportunities to avail myself of trinkets that formerly belonged to my lord's enemies.
[150:50.87]Buy myself out of bondage and find a hire as a free agent.
[150:55.13]My job was here.
[150:56.11]Unfortunately, my last employer's wife had a lovely amulet of a kind I simply could not resist.
[151:02.25]She doesn't know it's missing yet, but she might sue, and so tell me, are you looking for helpers?
[151:05.67]This person's going to steal shit from me.
[151:12.14]What can you do?
[151:13.66]I may not know how to read and write, but I know the quickest way to a man's heart is between his fourth and fifth rib, if you understand me.
[151:23.58]I'm looking down here.
[151:24.94]One, two, three, four, five.
[151:30.12]What's in my ribs?
[151:34.70]Stomach?
[151:35.82]Stomach.
[151:37.91]I can throw.
[151:39.77]You and me are going to be real close friends.
[151:43.51]I can throw.
[151:44.13]I can stab.
[151:45.95]And I'm slippery.
[151:47.27]You'll find me useful in a fight.
[151:49.03]Mm-hmm.
[151:53.56]That's good.
[151:54.50]So how about paying me a little something to seal off our agreement?
[151:57.06]A mere $200 would be enough.
[151:59.63]Please don't take this the wrong way, but I've had some bad luck with employers.
[152:03.25]You go fuck yourself.
[152:04.05]You're not getting $200.
[152:10.27]Me and five of my mates are looking for a master.
[152:12.86]We'll join you for $15.96.
[152:18.23]2... 2, 4, 6, 8, 10... Fuck, that... She's... You guys are more expensive.
[152:24.15]What about you?
[152:31.38]You do well to know me.
[152:32.24]I travel a lot across Colorado and keep an open ear.
[152:35.02]I can provide you information that you might find useful.
[152:40.24]Um... What can you tell me about this land?
[152:43.66]Divide into rival kingdoms which can neither manage to live in peace with their neighbors nor completely eliminate them.
[152:49.69]As a result, there's seldom a break to the bitter wars which plague this land and drain its lifeblood.
[152:54.81]This must be a good place to be for an adventurer such as yourself.
[152:57.71]With some luck and skill, you can make slow the fuck down.
[153:01.67]You're going way too fast.
[153:04.63]Why does everyone want to go so fast?
[153:09.02]Those kind of speeds scare me.
[153:11.36]That's a scary speed.
[153:15.01]You go off of like 45 and I start to get nervous.
[153:24.88]What were we doing?
[153:27.22]Opportunities are endless and so are the rewards if you're willing to risk your life for them.
[153:32.34]Tell me about these opportunities.
[153:33.46]The kingdoms will pay good money for mercenaries if they are engaged in a war.
[153:38.06]If you've done a bit of fighting, speaking with one of their lords will probably result in being offered a mercenary contract.
[153:44.37]The real rewards, however, come if you can manage to become a vessel to a king.
[153:49.71]A vessel can own villages, castles, and towns and get rich with the taxes and revenues of these estates.
[153:56.48]Okay.
[153:59.44]A king will not hesitate in time of war to accept someone who's distinguished himself on the battlefield as a vessel and grant him the right to own land.
[154:08.36]Not unheard of for adventurers to renounce allegiance to a Calradian king altogether, declare themselves kings, and claim land in their own name, just like the video game board game Risk.
[154:19.23]This is a difficult path, however, as the great nobles of the land, with their long, long arms, are not likely to accept such upstarts as their monarch.
[154:28.47]Okay.
[154:32.60]It might be easier for an adventurer like yourself to pledge support to an existing king's rival.
[154:40.09]Give me a name.
[154:40.59]I usually hear news about some of them and may be able to tell you their location with some precision, but of course I would ask for a little something.
[155:12.34]I want to know the location of a claimant.
[155:15.08]I want to know... Lady Isola of Suno.
[155:36.24]Don't read everything, just play the game.
[155:39.76]How am I supposed to play the game if I can't even read everything?
[155:41.74]I'll just be lost.
[155:43.96]Don't I need to know how this works?
[155:50.59]Isn't reading 50% of how you figure out what to do in the game?
[155:54.23]Alright, never mind.
[156:00.93]Farewell.
[156:08.02]That's super late game.
[156:10.50]All right.
[156:11.38]Where's the guy that I'm waiting for?
[156:12.76]I have to fucking deliver a... The mailman doesn't wait.
[156:15.10]You put it in the mailbox.
[156:21.16]Where the hell is this guy?
[156:31.43]He's close to Ferretchen.
[156:33.61]What is that?
[156:37.78]No, no, no.
[156:38.12]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[156:39.28]He's coming.
[156:40.76]Did he get in?
[156:42.83]Was that him?
[156:43.45]That little bug that went across the screen?
[156:50.83]No!
[156:55.33]Nothing happened?
[156:56.07]Okay, nothing happened.
[157:11.25]Oh God.
[157:12.27]Okay.
[157:15.00]Wait, why?
[157:16.12]He's in the field, he's close to Ismerella Castle.
[157:20.50]You told me he was coming here.
[157:22.02]I gotta go find him.
[157:41.61]Ismerela castle, uh He's over here, okay, he's going from like here to here How am I gonna fucking find this guy
[158:14.40]Just go find him.
[158:15.54]That's what I'm going to have to do.
[158:17.02]Wait, watch out.
[158:18.96]Who's this?
[158:19.29]Who's that?
[158:23.51]Garth's party.
[158:24.33]Okay.
[158:26.97]Jarl Garth is not who I'm looking for.
[158:38.02]Carry on.
[158:41.69]Watch out for bandits.
[158:43.57]Who the hell are these people?
[158:45.45]No, not the right person.
[158:48.05]Not the right person.
[158:51.95]That's Eric.
[159:03.85]Wait.
[159:06.62]There's Turrigor?
[159:08.14]No.
[159:09.32]No.
[159:19.40]Wait!
[159:22.24]No.
[159:23.10]No.
[159:26.80]Do control space?
[159:27.84]Well, don't I want to... I'm, like, looking for the guy, right?
[159:32.43]Isn't fast travel going to dump me over there?
[159:40.55]I'm, like, I'm looking for him.
[159:46.89]Alright, he's apparently in here.
[159:49.36]No, there he is again.
[159:50.34]Recruit more people.
[159:57.82]There he is.
[159:58.64]Found you.
[160:00.60]Found you, you fucking asshole.
[160:02.60]Come here.
[160:02.88]I have a... I ha... Found you.
[160:07.60]My name is Carton, at your service.
[160:11.15]I'm Jarl Aedan, a vessel of Kingdom of Nords and the Lord of Tyr.
[160:15.64]I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device, no matter.
[160:18.86]A brave man's home is all the world, or so they say.
[160:22.46]What is it?
[160:24.52]I bring a message from King Ragnar.
[160:28.52]Oh, let me see that.
[160:30.22]Well, well, well, it was good of you to bring this to me, Carton.
[160:33.74]Take my seal as proof that I've received it, and give my regards to King Ragnar when you see him again.
[160:40.83]What a waste of fucking time.
[160:42.59]Do you have anything for me to do?
[160:46.33]No, Carton, I do not need your help.
[160:49.97]I'm here to deliver you my demands.
[160:52.57]Okay, well, in that case, fuck you and empty your pockets.
[160:56.82]No, I'm a loser right now.
[160:57.98]I'm a loser!
[160:58.88]I can't do that.
[160:59.50]I gotta ask you a question.
[161:05.84]What are you and your men doing?
[161:07.08]What is the realm doing?
[161:08.32]How goes the war?
[161:09.72]What would it take to cement a lasting alliance with your house?
[161:15.32]Alright, where's the king?
[161:17.92]Traveling to Sargoth, he should be close to Telrog Castle.
[161:20.64]Okay.
[161:22.66]See you later.
[161:25.24]Now I'm going to control space, right?
[161:30.16]Control space, click.
[161:33.83]How do I fast travel?
[161:37.95]Control space.
[161:42.95]Hold it.
[161:43.75]Hold it.
[161:44.49]Hold it.
[161:45.75]Control space.
[161:46.65]Hold it.
[161:47.31]Hold it!
[161:48.33]Okay, guys.
[161:50.73]Click first.
[161:53.88]Click first.
[161:54.52]Control space.
[161:55.78]Holy shit, that's too fast.
[161:59.58]I'm never doing that ever again.
[162:00.68]Alright, I did your fucking dirty work.
[162:03.68]Now give me a place to- Ouch!
[162:09.14]You got this, like, dusty?
[162:10.24]What about me?
[162:13.20]We meet again.
[162:14.55]My lord, I've come to offer you my sword.
[162:16.15]I wish to ask you something.
[162:20.31]You've yet to show yourself as a competent commander.
[162:23.70]I already did it.
[162:24.52]I have something we could...
[162:33.71]I have something you could help with, an issue with the lawless villain known as Albard Hothead.
[162:38.91]He murdered one of my men and has been on the run from his judgment ever since.
[162:42.77]I can't let him get away with avoiding justice, so I put a bounty of three hundred dollars on his head.
[162:49.36]Friends of the murdered man reckon that this assassin may have taken refuge with his kinsmen at the Veyage Egg.
[162:56.48]You might be able to hunt him down and give him what he deserves, and claim the bounty for yourself.
[163:03.52]Then I will hunt him down and execute the law.
[163:06.47]Excellent, Cartman.
[163:07.29]I will be grateful to you and so will the family of the man he murdered.
[163:11.03]And of course, the bounty... Oh, fuck.
[163:14.15]I forgot.
[163:15.73]I will be grateful to you and so will the family of the man that he murdered.
[163:19.60]And of course, the bounty on his head will be yours if you can get him.
[163:23.50]Well, good hunting to you.
[163:25.72]Whatever.
[163:26.54]I almost just backhanded the king in the face.
[163:36.71]Uh, he's currently believed to be at Veyeyeg.
[163:42.32]The village of Veyeyeg near Telrog Castle belongs to Jarl Farn.
[163:47.60]It's very poor.
[163:48.36]Okay, so near Telrog Castle, let's recruit some people here.
[163:53.22]I'm gonna get at least like 15 to 20 people.
[163:57.90]Did you model your character after yourself?
[163:59.44]Yeah.
[164:00.48]That's pretty fucking cool, huh?
[164:04.04]Good day.
[164:04.40]How is life?
[164:04.84]What's your trade?
[164:05.36]What's the latest rumor around here?
[164:10.04]Uh... Turigor almost came to blows with another lord lately.
[164:13.74]Because the man made a joke about his nose.
[164:17.27]Have a nice life.
[164:17.91]Alright, let's go.
[164:25.77]So, uh... Where is that castle?
[164:34.47]What was it called again?
[164:35.19]Uh... Feyeyeg.
[164:40.91]Feyeyeg.
[164:42.67]How do I say this?
[164:43.51]Feyeyeg.
[164:45.07]Feyeyeg.
[164:46.75]It's Y, right?
[164:50.11]Tellrog Castle.
[164:53.77]Click show on map.
[164:55.33]No.
[164:57.41]That is Feyeyeg.
[165:01.11]Show on map!
[165:01.83]Show on map!
[165:02.55]Show on map!
[165:04.48]Alright, well, I found it.
[165:05.42]Everybody fucking relax.
[165:06.50]I need more recruits, though.
[165:10.92]It's burning.
[165:11.64]Well, it's alright.
[165:13.17]They'll... It's been burnt.
[165:17.19]Well, it's fine.
[165:18.13]The guy's hiding there.
[165:21.11]I need more recruits.
[165:24.05]No, you know what?
[165:24.51]Fuck it.
[165:24.79]I'm going in.
[165:25.23]I don't need recruits.
[165:34.37]The village has been looted.
[165:35.35]A handful of souls scatter as you pass through the burnt house.
[165:50.98]Okay.
[165:55.12]Let's go here.
[165:59.31]Let's get some recruits.
[166:00.69]Recruit volunteers!
[166:02.65]No one here seems to be willing to join your party.
[166:06.76]Well then fuck off.
[166:14.98]Okay, what about... What about these places?
[166:17.87]Does this mean I can't go over there?
[166:19.67]Yeah, is it like, oh no, you're at a rival place.
[166:29.88]Am I going to get in trouble for talking to people here?
[166:31.82]Okay.
[166:36.31]Recruit.
[166:37.49]Six Swadian recruits to volunteer to follow you.
[166:40.67]Hell yeah.
[166:47.04]What do you guys got?
[166:48.12]Spices, pottery, pork, wool cloth.
[166:51.94]And you got no money.
[166:57.74]What about... Just go... Just snipe people from all these villages.
[167:05.41]Crew volunteers.
[167:06.33]Four of them, yeah.
[167:11.95]Okay, hold on.
[167:15.94]Go up here.
[167:17.14]Let's go.
[167:18.04]Let's get like 50 people.
[167:22.64]Three?
[167:22.96]Okay.
[167:23.66]Okay.
[167:28.11]Over here.
[167:28.45]Recruit volunteers.
[167:31.83]Two.
[167:32.89]Okay.
[167:36.23]Alright.
[167:37.49]Let me see what I got.
[167:39.40]Still level two.
[167:41.92]Party.
[167:45.44]Fifteen recruits.
[167:47.04]Okay, so I got a lot of people now.
[167:54.56]Let's head there.
[167:55.08]Is this thing still on fire?
[167:56.02]I think it's still on fire.
[168:01.80]Let's head to Ambien.
[168:05.20]Whoa, a weekly what?
[168:07.49]Wages for Carton's party.
[168:09.05]Next... 300 and... Hold on.
[168:11.47]Earlier wealth, new wealth.
[168:12.75]38 bucks... I have 38 people in my party?
[168:18.03]Okay.
[168:23.13]No, that makes... That makes sense.
[168:24.23]Let's check Ambien.
[168:40.44]When does this get rebuilt?
[168:44.38]I'm gonna have to have, like, another mission here, then.
[168:48.62]They don't fight for free.
[168:53.68]So, I need to do something else.
[168:55.35]What was the other guy?
[168:55.95]The guy was up here, right?
[168:57.77]Billion?
[168:58.15]I'm gonna go up here in the meantime.
[169:06.75]Alright, where am I?
[169:15.28]Let's go fight some bandits.
[169:17.88]I could do that, couldn't I?
[169:21.42]Any bandits around the castle?
[169:29.39]Imagine serving under this guy.
[169:36.37]Have I run into sea raiders?
[169:37.61]I have.
[169:41.57]Bandits.
[169:41.89]Look at my bandits.
[169:42.45]Bandits.
[169:44.23]Bandits anywhere?
[169:50.70]Well, anybody have anything here?
[169:52.68]Nobody willing to join.
[169:53.46]Okay.
[169:56.48]Go to village center.
[169:58.60]You guys have any problems?
[170:03.63]Why do I have a health bar?
[170:11.73]Anybody need anything?
[170:18.06]Good day.
[170:18.44]What can you tell me about the village?
[170:20.25]This is the village of Coolum, sir.
[170:21.83]Our village and the surrounding lands belong to Jarl... I'm sorry.
[170:26.13]We produce butter, pork, chicken, bread, grain, grapes, fruit, dried meat, cabbages, cheese, smoked fish.
[170:32.66]So you're the guild master.
[170:34.82]Guild master.
[170:35.42]Great Canadian fuck club just gave $50.
[170:41.12]Thank you so much for 50 bucks, great Canadian fuck club.
[170:45.24]Uh, they say, here Jerma, use this to recruit more people.
[170:48.06]Just not Swadians.
[170:50.33]All they do is eat butter.
[170:53.71]What?
[170:57.33]Any tasks?
[170:58.73]Don't need anything, well.
[171:00.93]Any enemies?
[171:02.03]We've neither heard nor seen anything.
[171:05.46]Oh, fucking Jesus.
[171:06.34]But thank you so much, Great Canadian.
[171:08.30]Uh, Guildmaster.
[171:10.16]Look at the Guildmaster.
[171:18.75]You can't really go that way.
[171:22.67]Wait, that was him.
[171:26.71]So they don't need anything done here.
[171:31.84]This place is just boring.
[171:42.89]Okay.
[171:45.19]No, I can't just destroy villages.
[171:49.83]Let's go where we're supposed to go.
[171:51.70]If I see bandits, I'll take them out.
[171:59.14]Alright.
[172:00.22]Get in there.
[172:02.15]Crew volunteers.
[172:03.43]I'll take them.
[172:10.68]So let me see what else I had here.
[172:12.12]There was... What was his name again?
[172:15.52]I don't remember his name.
[172:16.74]I know he was here, though.
[172:25.18]Do I have enough food?
[172:26.73]I did buy a lot in the beginning.
[172:30.47]Just declare war.
[172:32.01]No, I can't do that.
[172:33.11]I'm enjoying just enjoying the game.
[172:36.28]Who are you?
[172:37.60]Village Elder.
[172:39.16]Welcome to Bullion.
[172:39.98]I'm the elder of this village.
[172:43.62]I need you to set a large fire on the outskirts of... Uh... What is this?
[172:53.61]I need you to make a fire.
[172:55.91]I have my reasons and you'll have yours.
[172:57.35]A purse of silver.
[172:58.15]Will you do it?
[172:59.78]Given the risk you are taking, you are entitled to know my plan.
[173:03.00]I wish to rescue a prisoner from Chalbeck Castle.
[173:06.32]When you light the fire, the guards in Chalbeck Castle will see the smoke and some of them will rush outside to see what's going on.
[173:12.24]Who am I rescuing?
[173:19.66]As you say, sir, but in doing this, we are taking a very great risk.
[173:22.52]What's in it for us?
[173:29.35]Never mind.
[173:31.17]Do you have anything I can have?
[173:32.21]Bandits have driven away our cattle.
[173:34.23]Our pastures are empty.
[173:35.19]If we had just a few heads of cattle, we could start to raise a herd again.
[173:39.15]How many animals do you need?
[173:40.69]I think eight heads will suffice for a small herd.
[173:45.40]I will bring you the cattle.
[173:49.90]Okay.
[173:50.42]Thank you.
[173:50.78]We'll be praying for you night and day.
[173:55.26]Just go get cattle.
[173:56.40]Deliver eight heads of cattle.
[174:00.01]30 days.
[174:00.29]Do it.
[174:05.70]Where the fuck am I supposed to find cattle?
[174:15.68]Wait, will you take cabbages instead?
[174:21.00]Cattle.
[174:28.49]I need to, like, wait here, don't I?
[174:40.59]You get a lot of experience, but no money.
[174:43.40]Terrible quest, terrible, terrible, terrible.
[174:46.80]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[174:48.52]Is this guy available yet?
[174:49.48]I have to go into this castle, don't I?
[174:58.64]It's this one right here, right?
[175:04.15]You are outside Chalbeck Castle.
[175:05.59]You see the banner of Jarl Gondor of Kingdom of Nords over the castle gates.
[175:13.47]Takes one in-game week to repair.
[175:15.39]Okay, approach the gates.
[175:19.85]You approach the gate.
[175:20.85]The men on the walls watch you closely.
[175:22.52]Request entry to the castle or request a meeting with someone.
[175:30.35]I'm forced to meeting.
[175:32.67]Who do you want to meet?
[175:33.63]Forget it!
[175:35.64]Let me in.
[175:37.04]After a brief wait, the guards open the gates for you and allow your party inside.
[175:41.26]You are at Chalbeck Castle.
[175:42.58]You see the banner of Jarl Gundyr of Kingdom of Nors over the castle gate.
[175:48.31]Take a walk around.
[175:49.11]Go to the Lord's Hall.
[175:58.05]Okay, there's Lady Karyasa.
[176:01.41]I am Karten.
[176:03.50]I want to know the location, and may I have the honor of knowing more about you?
[176:05.78]I want to... Where's, um... Well, where is he?
[176:15.66]In the field, and he should be close to Fenada at the moment.
[176:21.29]Can I know more?
[176:21.83]I am wife to Jarl Gundur, mother to Jarl Garth, mother to Lady Sveeple.
[176:28.00]May I have the honor of knowing... Is there anything I can do to win you a favor?
[176:30.93]No, Carton.
[176:31.39]I have no need for a champion right now.
[176:34.45]I don't know you well enough to act on your behalf.
[176:51.67]Vessel of King Ragnar.
[176:53.81]He's Lord of Chaldea Castle.
[176:55.91]He's got a big family.
[176:57.85]Last time you heard about him was in the field and he was close to Fae Nada, report his current.
[177:04.26]Cancel the cattle quest.
[177:06.36]How do you cancel the cattle quest?
[177:09.42]Cancel?
[177:15.46]Cancel?
[177:18.63]Just, it's gonna fail.
[177:20.61]Whatever, I'll take that place.
[177:23.77]So he's near... Let's go back out here.
[177:36.89]Take a walk around the courtyard.
[177:38.15]Just leave.
[177:43.35]I'm trying to remember, what was the guy's name that was in Bullion?
[177:47.41]There was a guy that I could talk to, right?
[177:49.23]Maybe it was Nighttime?
[177:58.19]That was me.
[178:07.81]Bandits.
[178:09.23]There's Bulba.
[178:12.51]I gotta get in some fights.
[178:13.39]This guy coming after me?
[178:15.03]What are you doing?
[178:18.29]I need to, like, level up.
[178:21.29]Fight him?
[178:21.73]I'm not gonna fight that guy.
[178:27.72]Uh...
[178:29.27]Count Montewar of Kingdom has been taken prisoner by Kanate.
[178:34.13]Was defeated in battle.
[178:34.97]Alright, before they were just bandits running after me left and right.
[178:41.45]They were sea raiders blocking all my paths.
[178:43.17]Where the hell are they now?
[178:45.77]Right there.
[178:47.17]Sea raiders.
[178:53.33]Where the... My party's too big and everyone's afraid of me?
[178:58.29]Should I get rid of them?
[179:10.01]Will somebody attack me, please?
[179:15.72]Who the fuck are you?
[179:16.64]Farmers?
[179:17.16]No, I can't just kill farmers.
[179:20.06]I can't farm farmers for experience.

[186:27.18]Where do I... What?
[186:35.41]I don't even know what... I didn't make... I didn't do any... I didn't change any options.

[187:32.65]So this is going to be $642.
[187:34.19]That's good.
[187:34.61]I'll take it.
[187:34.99]Okay, so what are you guys talking about?
[187:43.16]I just loaded up the game and started a new game.
[187:46.14]I didn't like, let me put it on easy.
[187:48.86]This is just whatever the default setting is.
[187:59.70]Uh, okay.
[188:00.44]Hold on.
[188:06.34]Uh... Can't... Poor... Poor.
[188:11.32]Average... Average?
[188:13.14]I don't... Good?
[188:14.90]I don't know.
[188:15.94]I didn't change this.
[188:24.91]Uh, AMCO the Terrible just gave $50.
[188:31.72]Thank you, Amco the Table, for 50 bucks!
[188:36.08]Big money.
[188:37.44]And they say, ignore chat, keep playing the way that you like and have fun with.
[188:40.98]The normal mode of Warband is super hard and frustrating.
[188:46.29]It's just starting out.
[188:47.71]Just have fun, I don't want you to abandon this game.
[188:56.21]He's what, what?
[188:58.95]It's right, it's good advice.
[189:02.70]Increased difficulty.
[189:03.80]Abandoned.
[189:04.42]Probably bullshit.
[189:05.72]What?
[189:09.04]Uh... Well, I can change this at any time, so if I don't like this, I'm gonna put it back down to where it was on the default.
[189:22.29]I mean... Turn up the battle size.
[189:28.67]Okay.
[189:29.52]Okay.
[189:34.69]Damage to the player... Wait.
[189:41.48]Damage to friends, damage to player.
[189:45.32]So wait, why the hell would they have this all on easy?
[189:49.96]As the default setting then?
[189:51.12]Is the game just that difficult?
[189:56.49]So am I going to now just like lose every fight?
[190:02.65]No, fuck that.
[190:06.07]I don't know what this is on.
[190:08.23]Lance control?
[190:08.85]What was it?
[190:17.83]It's unforgiving.
[190:25.31]Lance was manual.
[190:26.81]Oh, okay.
[190:32.21]It's unreasonably difficult.
[190:36.65]Yeah, I think, I don't know if a lot of you guys might not know that, like, this is, does, okay, I don't know, I have no idea, but I'm getting two sides of a coin here.
[190:45.34]Half of you guys are saying that, holy shit, do not do what you're doing right now, this is a really bad, stupid idea, and the other half are going, like, get good Dark Souls, put it on hard.
[190:55.12]You know what I mean?
[190:56.94]I'm just gonna do, you know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna keep it the way it was here.
[190:59.84]I'm gonna put these up.
[191:10.01]That's it.
[191:10.68]I'm gonna keep it the way it was.
[191:20.50]The fun mode is still on.
[191:22.50]I mean... Look, I understand.
[191:27.99]Like, we have this conversation sometimes.
[191:29.97]If you have, like, 4,000 hours in Warband, that's great.
[191:35.19]And I'm sure you know everything.
[191:36.09]I'm sure you're very good at it.
[191:38.40]But...
[191:39.79]I just walked in three hours ago.
[191:43.57]And this is the default.
[191:51.57]Like, I'm not gonna walk into the... Okay, I just walked into the taekwondo or karate seminar.
[192:01.50]And the guy's sitting there like, okay, welcome to the karate seminar.
[192:04.14]We're gonna put you into groups here of skill and time, how long you've been here.
[192:09.43]And I raise my hand, I'm like, can I be in the black belt class?
[192:13.11]No.
[192:13.81]No, you can't.
[192:14.77]Yes, I can.
[192:15.27]Get good.
[192:16.71]Sit down.
[192:17.47]You're not ready for that yet.
[192:19.11]You need to go through the citrus belt first.
[192:21.59]No, I don't.
[192:22.11]Get good, idiot.
[192:23.96]He's gonna kick the shit out of me.
[192:24.96]That guy's gonna punch me in the face once and I'm gonna go down.
[192:28.84]Is that what you want?
[192:36.42]Yes.
[192:37.58]Wait, what?
[192:42.19]No, I've got to get my, like, fucking tapioca belt and go through fucking, like... I can't just go right to black belt.
[193:00.45]Anyways.
[193:02.18]Let's continue playing the game after I take a piss.
[193:06.70]Because it's been three hours and I haven't gone to the bathroom one time.
[193:09.90]That's a lot.
[193:10.40]That's like an eternity.
[193:12.73]And this stream.
[193:19.96]That just steal the black button?
[193:21.34]No, but that is actually... Like, okay.
[193:25.79]To add on to what I just said.
[193:28.01]I go into the karate the first day of... Okay, welcome to the karate seminar.
[193:33.46]I get put into citrus belt.
[193:35.30]I do.
[193:36.16]Oh, this is... Ah, Jeremy, you definitely don't have what it takes to be part of the brown belt or the black belt.
[193:41.66]No, no, no, no, no.
[193:42.20]You've got to work your way up.
[193:43.71]I go, okay, sure.
[193:45.21]So I do two classes in citrus belt.
[193:47.75]And then when he lost... Okay, the classes are over.
[193:51.71]I break into the fucking karate place and I scratch my name off citrus and I like write it into black belt and come in the next day.
[194:00.44]That's what this is.
[194:06.02]Like I just like put myself on the black belt list under his nose.
[194:09.66]All right, see you in a minute.
[194:40.76]Thank you.

[204:35.13]So I kind of need to... And then there's a guy up here that I was going to do, but he's just not there.
[204:41.54]You know, I'm just gonna go in here and just talk to the Lord and be like, hey, I need to talk to you.
[204:49.84]Uh, Lord's Hall.
[204:55.57]Who are you and can I do something for you?
[205:00.99]I am Carton.
[205:03.43]They're not here.
[205:04.39]Why is everybody always at war and fighting?
[205:06.05]Why are you never at your house?
[205:18.36]Nobody's ever at that house.
[205:21.56]It's called Warband.
[205:25.62]If you gotta leave some defense, you gotta leave a lord.
[205:28.98]Is this place fucking ready yet?
[205:39.51]Who's that?
[205:40.43]Deserters!
[205:41.81]They're running from Carton!
[205:45.01]Who the fuck are you?
[205:46.58]What do you mean running from me?
[205:48.42]You're running from me.
[205:53.93]What?
[206:01.71]Where'd they go?
[206:02.27]Go, go, go, go.
[206:02.97]Where'd they go?
[206:10.82]They're gone.
[206:15.24]It's because I turned nighttime and my horse put, like, fucking heavy shoes on.
[206:19.14]Wait.
[206:19.84]There they are.
[206:27.00]Deserters.
[206:28.60]Get over here.
[206:31.29]Come here.
[206:35.63]How could a deserter have a better horse than a noble lord?
[206:38.23]I don't know.
[206:38.65]He's too fast.
[206:43.13]I'll catch him.
[206:55.75]Come on.
[206:56.43]I just bumped into them.
[206:59.51]Really?
[207:01.83]Where are they going?
[207:02.53]Alright.
[207:11.58]There's my weekly budget.
[207:13.82]Who cares about these guys?
[207:15.32]These places should no longer be on fire.
[207:19.46]There it is.
[207:20.02]Just go.
[207:21.04]Hurry up.
[207:28.22]Where the hell am I?
[207:35.31]Okay.
[207:53.62]The bones, uh, you remember that this village and the surrounding lands belong to Jarl Farn.
[207:57.66]The village is infested by 15 forest bandits.
[208:01.74]Let's go.
[208:02.06]Oh my god, I got a shitload of people here.

[209:43.65]Only one wounded on my team.
[209:47.13]In a battle worthy of a song, you and your men drive the bandits out of the village, making it safe once more.
[209:51.99]The villagers have little left in the way of wealth after their ordeal, but they offer you all they can find.
[209:58.92]Uh... I'm going to refuse.
[210:01.84]You need those items more than I do.

[217:41.69]Where is the king?
[217:42.61]Can you tell me where he is?
[217:49.50]King Ragnar.
[217:51.78]Close to Sargoth at the moment.
[217:53.34]He's in the field.
[217:54.18]Okay.
[218:02.04]Not over here.
[218:03.52]Hey, you are.

[218:11.81]We meet again, Cartman.
[218:13.01]Uh, about that task you gave me.
[218:17.05]Yes, have you made any progress on it?
[218:19.27]I found Albert hard-headed hiding in Veyagag and gave him his punishment.
[218:23.77]And we'll be a lot better off without him.
[218:25.45]Thank you, Cartman, for removing this long, festering thorn from my side.
[218:29.62]It is good to know you can be trusted to handle things with an appropriate level of tactfulness.
[218:35.60]A bounty I promised, and I bounty you shall have three hundred dreams, and not a copper less.
[218:43.32]Let me take the money.
[218:44.26]Thank you.
[218:46.87]Yubai, thanks for ridding me of that base varlet.
[218:48.95]The relationship with King Ragnar has increased from 2 to 3.
[218:54.66]Level 2.
[218:54.94]Do you have any tasks?
[218:58.56]I have come to offer you my sword.
[219:01.76]You've yet to... Alright.
[219:04.13]More tasks.
[219:06.96]You probably know that I am the lord of the town of Sargoth.
[219:09.66]However, it has been months since Sargoth has delivered the taxes and rents due me as its rightful lord.
[219:15.32]Apparently the populace there has grown unruly lately.
[219:19.25]And I need someone to go there and remind them of their obligations.
[219:23.29]And to persuade them if they won't listen.
[219:26.29]If you go there and raise the taxes they owe me, I will grant you one fifth of everything you collect.
[219:34.72]Uh, okay.
[219:37.42]Welcome, news card.
[219:39.16]I will entrust this matter to you.
[219:40.44]Remember those townsmen are foxy beasts.
[219:43.25]They will make every excuse not to pay me my rightful income.
[219:46.43]Do not let them fool you.
[219:49.83]Cool.
[219:50.57]Collect taxes.
[219:52.71]Collect taxes from Sargoth.
[219:56.22]Collect taxes.
[220:01.24]How does one collect taxes?
[220:02.36]Just walk up to people and say, give me money?
[220:07.86]Let's give it a go.
[220:12.30]Take a walk around the streets.
[220:17.39]Oh, they're getting a little unruly.
[220:27.83]Collect- Oh come on this- it just popped up for the- okay.
[220:32.19]You can't give me shit for this because this menu just like popped up.
[220:36.46]It just added one.
[220:41.16]It's like three days.
[220:45.82]Start the collection.
[220:46.54]113, 113, 184, 203, 203, 144, 85, 39, 77, 3.
[220:56.82]This is free money.
[220:58.64]The people of Sargoth are outraged at your demands and decry it as nothing more than extortion.
[221:02.86]They're getting very restless and they may react badly if you keep pressing them.
[221:08.76]Oh, give me more of that money!
[221:14.22]21, 130, 11, 169.
[221:15.88]I'm going to be fucking rich.
[221:17.70]Fuck the king.
[221:19.00]Fuck Sargoth.
[221:20.17]I'm going to go over to the next town and be cool with them.
[221:23.59]And then we can go from there.
[221:25.05]Why would I return this money?
[221:26.25]This is free money.
[221:34.07]Look at this shit.
[221:37.13]I just hit the jackpot.
[221:40.95]You've finished reading... Wait, wait.
[221:45.41]You have finished reading Dera Militari.
[221:47.66]Your tactics has increased by one.
[221:51.44]Okay.
[221:53.84]Guys, this is... This is outrageous how much money this is.
[221:58.55]I have a choice now.
[222:03.51]You've collected 8,000.
[222:06.78]Okay.
[222:07.36]Uh... So I'm... I mean, the general consensus is I'm never coming here ever again.
[222:21.65]Like, we're gone.
[222:24.76]No, I'm just gonna leave.
[222:31.74]Who hates, uh, King Ragnar?
[222:33.70]What's, like, the direct rival?
[222:42.73]Time to find a different kingdom!
[222:50.82]Alright, hold on.
[222:51.46]I need to think about this.
[222:57.77]So the Nords...
[223:02.73]The kingdom of Nords is at war with the kingdom of Vagiers.
[223:06.75]The kingdom of Vagiers declared war to regain lost territory.
[223:09.65]The fighting has gone on for some time, and the war may end soon with a truce.
[223:14.90]So we've got to go to the kingdom of Vagiers.
[223:29.17]That's $10,000.
[223:29.43]Come on.
[223:36.60]Kante.
[223:38.24]Kanate.
[223:41.46]We're at war with Swadia.
[223:43.92]No outstanding issues with Vagiers.
[223:49.93]What happened to loyalty?
[223:52.53]This is war.
[223:53.61]That title of the game is Warband.
[223:56.27]Didn't somebody talk shit to me about that earlier?

[228:17.73]Where's your lord?
[228:18.43]No, let's go to the town center.
[228:29.19]Where is everybody?
[228:31.68]Townswoman.
[228:33.56]Uh, what can you tell me about this town?
[228:34.92]A town in the surrounding lands belonged to King Yaroglik of Kingdom of Vagiers.
[228:40.48]We mostly produce bread.
[228:42.86]And a bunch of other stupid shit.
[228:44.86]If you'd like to learn more, you can speak with our guildmaster!
[228:47.10]He's nearby!
[228:48.10]Right over there!
[228:48.88]Okay.
[228:58.41]Guildmaster.
[229:01.25]What you do?
[229:01.71]Do you have a job?
[229:02.55]I have some questions of a political nature!
[229:05.24]Politics?
[229:05.76]Good heaven, the guild has nothing to do with politics.
[229:07.48]We're loyal servants of King Yaruglek.
[229:09.84]We merely govern our own affairs and pass on the townspeople's concern to our lord.
[229:14.24]What did you want to ask?
[229:14.98]Uh, what do you think about politics?
[229:23.27]Okay.
[229:24.95]Internal bickering in other realms.
[229:28.89]The lords of a realm often have very different ideas about honor, strategy, and the way a nobleman should behave.
[229:34.97]They compete with each other for the ruler's favor, constantly weighing up their position, how they stand, how their friends and family stand, right?
[229:41.54]Mm-hmm.
[229:47.16]Yeah, it's about like, oh, you can sneak in and pull the rug from under somebody, and now you're a lord.
[229:56.43]If he believes the vessel is going to change sides or rebel, he may indict the vessel for treason and seize his properties.
[230:04.33]I got... I got nobody.
[230:08.57]I'm not... I don't... I'm good.
[230:10.58]Alright, you got any work?
[230:19.02]One of the merchants here is looking for a herdsman to take his cattle.
[230:22.10]We already know that's a failure.
[230:26.16]I wish to buy land in this town for a productive enterprise.
[230:29.78]Uh, what do I want to do?
[230:38.39]A couple of things to keep in mind, skilled laborers are always at a premium, so I doubt that you will be able to open up more than one enterprise here.
[230:46.28]In order to make a profit for yourself, you should choose a commodity which is in relatively short supply, but for which the raw materials are cheap.
[230:55.75]Uh, they do lots of bread.
[230:57.97]They do a lot of bread.
[231:02.42]Hold on, never mind.
[231:07.02]How's the trade?
[231:08.66]We have shortages of wool, smoked fish, grapes, grain, pork, and some other commodities.
[231:13.87]Wool.
[231:18.45]So I'm gonna make a wool factory.
[231:23.63]I'm just getting... I'm getting like a virus update.
[231:25.97]What the fuck are you doing?
[231:29.53]No, I don't... Why is it taking over my computer?
[231:34.76]Give me a break.
[231:38.24]We have received many traders in town here.
[231:39.53]Travelers coming from... We're trying to get traders here two days ago.
[231:43.97]okay there's little news about the caravan routes to towns yeah yeah yeah okay so we need how does the wealth of this region compare the rest of calradia we are poorer than three towns and richer than 18. okay
[232:08.17]We produce less than seven towns and produce more than fourteen.
[232:11.32]Production is, of course... This is one of those brain teasers.
[232:15.62]Jane has six jelly beans.
[232:18.28]If Mark comes over and takes two jelly beans and then gives them back three weeks later and she produces twelve jelly beans a day, I don't want to do that.
[232:33.97]Looting and pillage and shifts in territory can make a major impact.
[232:42.24]Okay.
[232:44.54]The village is produced less than the Hinderlin.
[232:46.66]Around eight towns produce more than 13.
[232:48.18]The wealth of a town's Hinderlin, of course, is heavily dependent on the tides of war.
[232:55.43]The town of Suno is believed to have received the most visits from caravans.
[233:00.47]We are less visited than four towns and more visited than 17.
[233:05.99]In terms of attacks on travelers, the town of Dirim is believed to be the most dangerous.
[233:11.66]Here, we are less afflicted by bandits and raiders than 12 towns and more afflicted than 9.
[233:16.76]I thought that was a middle finger.
[233:24.55]Alright.
[233:25.49]I'm going to buy a productive enterprise and it's going to be wool.
[233:34.71]A weavery to make wool cloth from wool.
[233:39.15]They get a shortage of it.
[233:45.00]Weavery and dye works to make velvet from silk and dye.
[233:53.84]Check how much you'll make each week on every option.
[233:58.17]Very good, sir.
[233:58.67]The land and the materials on which you may build your mill will cost you $1,500.
[234:01.93]$300 a week.
[234:02.33]$264 in labor will be $30.
[234:04.97]The profit will be $18 a week.
[234:08.15]Now,
[234:18.31]A brewery.
[234:20.34]Okay, so I guess that would probably be $122 a week.
[234:24.58]Nah, that's not good for me at the moment.
[234:29.10]Tannery, $220 a week.
[234:31.86]Okay, I think it's gonna be the tannery wine press.
[234:44.07]I guess that your profit will be negative $148 a week.
[234:47.97]Well then, Guildmaster Gary, that's not profit, that's loss.
[234:52.57]So, no thanks.
[234:55.29]Your profit will be, you owe me $150.
[234:57.01]That's not profit.
[234:57.67]An oil press.
[234:58.09]$208, that's not bad.
[235:10.24]And iron works.
[235:13.14]$42 a week.
[235:13.78]Don't think so.
[235:16.84]Weavery and dye works.
[235:19.23]Holy shit.
[235:21.03]Your profit would be $520 a week.
[235:28.27]No.
[235:30.53]Hold on.
[235:33.22]So what about just a weavery?
[235:34.16]Minus $50 a week.
[235:42.27]A weavery to make linen from flax.
[235:44.03]$70.
[235:46.07]No.
[235:47.17]That was crazy.
[235:52.40]How much is that one?
[235:53.16]Okay, so a weavery and a dye works.
[235:56.72]The land and the materials you... So $10,000 to start it.
[236:02.12]And $500 a week after that.
[236:07.66]Swindle the new king and then take the money somewhere else.
[236:15.60]Just keep swindling people out of taxes and then do tax evasion so much.
[236:20.31]Well, it's not tax evasion.
[236:22.23]That's just stealing money Okay All right What if I just never come back
[236:45.10]What was I doing?
[236:45.80]Who was I looking for?
[236:48.10]Oh, right, right, right.
[236:49.06]The king.
[236:52.40]So where was he?
[236:52.86]He was on the way, right?
[237:00.91]He was going this way.
[237:06.67]He was going to hang out somewhere over here.
[237:12.27]Where are you?
[237:12.73]Come on.
[237:16.60]Alright, only a hundred- okay, that's- the week is over.
[237:20.08]Are you in here, or what?
[237:33.35]You've run into a trap.
[237:34.99]You're attacked by a group of just me?!
[237:43.37]Oh, fuck.
[237:48.05]Jesus Christ, man.
[237:49.07]You gotta be kidding me.
[237:55.11]Like, what the fuck?
[237:57.26]I don't even know when I last saved it either.
[238:10.98]I have no idea.
[238:11.92]What was the last save point?
[238:19.96]Oh, let's put 50 points into throwing weapons.
[238:23.06]What a great idea, Jeremy.
[238:26.14]And let's put the difficulty up, away from the default.
[238:29.90]With 50 points in throwing weapons.
[238:40.96]Where the hell was I here?
[238:47.10]You lost 300.
[238:47.54]Time to save, scum.
[239:03.18]Well, I have to save spell now.
[239:08.94]Yeah, that don't matter.
[239:11.04]I literally just sat there and read the book.
[239:19.59]Put the sword in the first slot.
[239:20.91]I have to now.
[239:24.61]And the time it takes me to throw a weapon, they get so close, and then I take my sword out and I'm already dead.
[239:28.48]Alright, I'm looking for this guy.
[239:46.93]Food.
[239:53.77]Should be good.
[239:56.27]Right, now I have to do the find.
[239:58.59]I'm gonna just find the guy.
[240:00.81]He's not here.
[240:05.57]I asked around.
[240:06.97]It's like, oh, he's fucking walking around in circles somewhere.
[240:10.48]Over here.
[240:10.84]Alright, good to know.
[240:22.97]Come here.
[240:28.21]I'm gonna get ambushed.
[240:29.93]No, I'm not.
[240:33.90]Imagine eating rain.
[240:38.72]Buy dog food.
[240:40.68]I'm not gonna buy dog food for my soldiers.
[240:44.87]Where's the king?
[240:48.46]Excuse me everybody buddy here.
[240:49.68]I heard the king was walking around the circle over here somewhere elder.
[240:52.31]Can I talk to you, please?
[240:58.69]I don't need anything Fire are there any lads from this village who might want to seek their fortune in the war?
[241:13.31]No, all right, can I run into him now?
[241:14.87]Oh
[241:19.50]Where are you?
[241:25.50]Wait, where was he?
[241:26.06]Was that him?
[241:26.54]No, that's me.
[241:32.89]I'm just gonna wait here for him.
[241:35.97]Join the feast!
[241:38.99]Let's join the feast!
[241:41.25]There is a feast in progress in the Lord's Hall, but you are not of sufficient status to be invited inside!
[241:48.29]Perhaps increasing your renown would win you admittance, or you might also try disguising yourself as a tournament.
[241:53.93]Oh, the feast is in progress.
[241:56.48]All right, let's go to the tournament.
[242:01.22]The door is locked.
[242:02.52]Why is it locked?
[242:20.47]You are at the Tier 1 of the tournament with 64 participants remaining.
[242:24.05]In the next round, there will be 4 teams with 3 fighters each.
[242:33.03]Holy shit!
[242:33.89]Alright.
[242:35.05]$100 on me.
[242:40.25]Wait, the king is in this?
[242:44.36]You ask one of the criers for the names of the tournament participants.
[242:46.80]What if I kill the king accidentally?
[243:18.35]Alright, there he is!
[243:31.97]There's the king!
[243:32.65]I won $1300, didn't I?
[243:39.51]I did.
[243:47.57]You've won this melee, but now you must prepare yourself for the next round.
[243:50.00]You are tier 2.
[243:50.84]Oh.
[243:53.22]Okay, I'm not gonna win this.
[244:08.22]Why do they get swords?
[244:38.97]Come here These two dickheads over here in the corner All right, let me help you let's double team this guy
[245:01.40]We did it!
[245:02.26]That's another thousand dollars.
[245:05.10]Tier 3 of the tournament with 16 participants.
[245:07.10]Next round there'll be two teams of four fighters.
[245:09.50]Let's put another fucking thousand dollars, man.
[245:24.57]Oh, that guy just ate shit.
[245:33.80]Get him!
[245:36.90]Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up!
[245:38.26]Alright, I'm gonna get off the horse.
[245:41.98]No, I'm not.
[245:48.87]Just get off.
[245:58.71]Oh man, I'm gonna make a lot of money.
[245:59.81]This is the last round of the tournament.
[246:04.56]You are tier four of the tournament with eight people remaining.
[246:07.64]There will be three teams with one fighter each.
[246:18.43]Kill this guy right off the bat.
[246:19.53]Fuck!
[246:29.19]They're gonna fucking double team me, of course they are.
[246:39.45]All right, all right, all right.
[246:43.43]Fuck!
[246:44.45]No!
[246:45.49]Oh, it's just... Oh, God.
[247:04.81]That, like, he swung once, and then twice, and then...
[247:09.82]They fight like they're fucking possessed.
[247:12.02]Like they're trying to fight a demon being exercised from their bodies.
[247:36.33]How far the fuck away was I?
[247:39.93]I saved it somewhere.
[247:40.87]I don't even fucking remember.
[247:41.87]I don't- where- he was- he was- he was- he was at a feast or something.
[248:03.86]Wait a day.
[248:04.53]Okay.
[248:36.89]Since when did you guys fucking get your asses kicked?
[248:39.82]When did everybody lost?
[248:42.22]Everybody died.
[248:43.74]That was real quick.
[248:45.42]Okay.
[248:53.46]What the hell was that?
[249:05.99]I'm doing this one more time, then I'm just gonna light the place on fire.
[249:11.48]I'm going back to the other king.
[249:13.41]He at least let me be part of the fucking feast.
[249:38.66]Look, we got like the horses this time.
[249:42.17]How is this tournament any- how is this fair at all?
[249:44.31]How is this a fair tournament?
[249:52.73]These guys with the one-handers, man.
[249:54.43]Like, do you- do you have a fucking stamina bar?
[249:57.15]How am I supposed to get a swing in?
[249:58.89]How is it possible?
[250:00.30]This shit is not possible to hit a guy that swings every second.
[250:06.45]Fucking God.
[250:07.53]I'm gonna go back and just get the taxes.
[250:09.15]Fuck this.
[250:09.65]It's because I had a lance?
[250:16.12]I don't want a goddamn lance.
[250:17.48]I want my fucking sword.
[250:47.85]Oh, goddammit.
[250:49.01]On horseback again.
[250:49.87]I can't fucking move.
[250:55.22]You've pinned me in here!
[250:58.10]Get me out of the corner!
[251:06.77]Get away from me!
[251:07.91]No, get away from me!
[251:13.97]I don't wanna... Come here, come here!
[251:39.82]I don't know if I have enough room to just fucking dismount the damn horse.
[251:51.12]Get off.
[252:02.94]I'm going to fucking run, so let's go.
[252:12.56]Hold X?
[252:15.32]But look, add it to the list of other tutorial items that were never in a tutorial.
[252:21.10]I'm locked in here now, I gotta get off.
[252:34.25]Oh god, I'm so fucked here.
[252:41.20]Wait, no!
[252:42.34]No, I just skilled myself into reality.
[252:50.87]My whole team is dead.
[252:54.24]Oh, this is great.
[252:55.46]What am I gonna do about this?
[253:08.57]Off the horse!
[253:09.01]Get off the horse!
[253:09.72]Off, off, off, off the horse!
[253:11.94]Get off the horse, please!
[253:13.58]Get off the dismount!
[253:15.96]Why?
[253:18.21]Give me my sword!
[253:20.01]Do I not have a... I need a fucking weapon, give it to me!
[253:38.82]Do I not have a- a sword?
[253:46.98]Kill the horse.
[253:53.85]I don't have a sword.
[253:54.85]Alright, I-
[254:08.05]points into throwing weapons.
[254:10.84]Now I'm understanding.
[254:13.10]I mean, we're talking about every single point.
[254:16.84]Every single point has gone into throwing weapons.
[254:21.89]Every single one.
[254:30.43]Fucking hell.
[254:45.60]I can't win a tournament.
[254:48.37]After increasing the difficulty.
[254:52.17]Using a fucking lance or a sword.
[254:54.29]Ugh.
[254:57.37]I can't.
[254:57.65]Can I throw the lance?
[255:00.08]Through somebody's fucking brain matter?
[255:33.40]the horse oh god damn it really you all fucking lost all of you does this does the game just roll dice on what what what's going on here
[256:07.45]Don't let him out.
[256:28.98]Oh, I'm getting angry at this FUCK YOU game!
[256:32.60]Unbelievable!
[256:33.58]I- I- I gotta be- I'm so tilted by this fucking game, and tilted by my fucking character choices.
[256:42.14]This character's terrible!
[256:43.50]Why did I make this?
[256:45.05]What was the point in picking this character?
[256:48.27]This game is so hard, and I put the diffi- Why did I listen to everybody and put the difficulty up too?
[256:53.91]Why would I do that?
[256:54.69]The game is on default!
[256:55.77]Just play the game!
[257:00.75]I pressed G instead of X. Fucking god damn it.
[257:50.73]Save it here.
[257:51.35]I'm gonna actually do this one more time and then I'm gonna fucking throw up on the monitor.
[258:07.22]Can I get out, please?
[258:24.75]I fucking ran that guy's head over.
[258:26.11]Who cares?
[258:27.49]I'm gonna lose.
[258:41.07]You just stole taxes, you don't need this money.
[258:43.49]No, but I need a goddamn useful character!
[258:47.25]Instead of this dickhead!
[259:03.84]Gerber, turn up the difficulty!
[259:05.76]Hey, you know that character that you made that sucks absolute asshole?
[259:09.48]Yeah, make it harder, too!
[259:28.44]Fuck off.
[259:42.17]Ow, my body.
[259:56.65]Kill.
[259:57.71]Kill.
[259:59.51]Kill.
[260:00.43]Why don't you get a horse?
[260:16.29]What?
[260:39.30]Thankfully, you're stupider than I am.
[260:40.78]Okay.
[260:52.27]There will be four teams with one fighter each.
[261:16.50]Don't you dare fuck this up.
[261:18.60]Fucking dickhead.
[261:20.60]Oh, that was the king?!
[261:36.02]No!
[261:36.12]What?! !
[261:52.42]I'm so underleveled.
[261:59.05]So wait, that's it?
[261:59.69]You can't save in between?
[262:01.15]Scum doesn't work?
[262:05.51]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[262:06.29]Hold on.
[262:07.77]That's not true.
[262:10.58]Is that true?
[262:28.36]So I can't join, so I can't do it between rounds.
[262:32.30]Go back to default difficulty.
[262:33.62]Well, you understand I can't do that now.
[262:38.14]Because, like, a shitload of people were screaming in my ear to turn it up to hard.
[262:42.81]Turn it up harder.
[262:44.53]If I go back, I already made the deal with the devil.
[262:48.55]I already signed the fucking contract.
[262:51.35]So, like, the 601 guys that are going to be mad if I go back to the default difficulty...
[262:57.76]We're not going to hear the end of it the whole night.
[263:21.85]I want to burn this fucking city down.
[263:24.41]How do I do that?
[263:25.87]How do I walk in and just like fucking slash at the king?
[263:29.39]I don't care.
[263:30.49]I'm going back to the other guy and give him the taxes.
[263:34.50]I'm going to go throw a fucking rock through this king's window.
[263:37.38]Fuck his feast.

[270:34.57]What is... What are you doing?
[270:36.31]Hey, bandits right here.
[270:38.99]Come here.

[272:12.15]I don't know.
[272:32.35]Throw is not the way to do it.
[272:34.25]I can't do throw anymore.
[272:39.73]I don't care what it is.
[272:40.93]I'll have to fucking get the points back some other way.
[272:45.41]What do you have?
[272:49.51]What do you got on you?
[272:50.60]Masterwork sword.
[272:51.90]Okay.
[272:54.74]Fucking god damn it.
[272:59.88]Throwing rocks at people.
[273:02.04]Isn't that gonna be funny for 30 seconds?
[273:05.59]Let me just fuck up my game and then...
[273:15.63]This is actually good shit, yeah.
[273:18.59]You chose this life.
[273:19.84]Yeah, and then I got bullied into making the game harder.
[273:22.72]So I chose the life of being an idiot and putting points into fucking throwing weapons and putting my skills into throwing weapons.
[273:28.98]And then I got like bullied into making the game harder.
[273:33.01]You understand how this is like, there's two ends of that sword that we both grabbed on at the same time.
[273:51.70]OK.

[291:06.54]More.
[291:14.00]Four hours and only level five.
[291:15.42]Well, that's because I didn't know that I had to just kill bandits.
[291:20.11]I felt like I was doing missions in question.
[291:23.35]No, just kill bandits.
[291:27.21]I didn't know.
[291:27.61]We can do this the easy way or the hard way.
[291:44.54]Why has everyone been so silent?
[291:45.78]Pick up some speed and let's turn it in.

[293:11.17]I don't want to spend too much money.
[293:33.06]Alright, keep going.
[293:35.52]Over there.
[293:35.90]I gotta get at least to, like, level 6.
[293:40.20]Before I go sell anything or do anything.
[293:51.38]Can recruit some people.
[293:52.60]And I can recruit people here.
[293:53.82]Hey, two recruits.
[293:55.86]I'll take them.
[293:56.36]Why not?
[294:13.21]Deserters?
[294:15.06]I'll take them.
[294:22.59]We are the Free Brothers.
[294:23.96]We will fight only for ourselves from now on.
[294:25.74]Now give us all your gold or taste our steel.
[294:31.72]Uh, you're dead.
[294:43.33]What was the... We fight for... We fight for ourselves.
[294:45.83]We fight for goodness' sake.
[294:47.11]Did I miss that there or something?
[294:54.46]Take out the archers.
[295:06.34]Blocked it.
[295:08.63]Good for you.
[295:26.08]Uh, nobody dead?
[295:31.98]Now let's go sell, what do you say?
[295:36.12]Not level up?
[295:39.34]Well, let me go sell.
[295:43.05]Yeah, the bandits are up here, but I don't know if I can fight the bandits.
[295:46.51]Not the bandits, the Sea Raiders, because... Didn't that make the game harder?
[295:51.55]So, wasn't that the whole reason everyone got really mad that I beat the Sea Raiders?
[295:56.79]They were like, you're not supposed to be able to do that.
[295:59.37]And I had to change the difficulty.
[296:00.77]Let's go over here.
[296:15.82]This is the coast.
[296:21.12]I think I need to... Where the hell am I?
[296:22.64]What's going on?
[296:24.02]What?
[296:26.62]Alright, hold on.
[296:27.14]Can I... Here are these prisoners.
[296:29.66]Talk.
[296:32.46]Don't run away or do something stupid.
[296:34.00]I'll be watching you.
[296:34.78]No, I won't.
[296:35.26]Okay.
[296:37.38]Can I sell them here?
[296:45.91]I can't.
[296:51.11]I gotta go to like a bigger castle.
[296:54.33]Like this one!
[297:00.94]Can I not now?
[297:01.66]I need a bigger... a bigger town, like this one.
[297:14.99]Uh, what about Riviceg?
[297:17.03]It's a huge place I haven't been to yet.
[297:20.13]Let's explore.
[297:21.57]Visit the tavern.
[297:22.35]Okay, I got five people here for you.
[297:29.64]Uh, Jeremis.
[297:33.60]How can I help you?
[297:38.85]Gross iniquity.
[297:40.77]I warn you in advance, lest you are of a choleric temperament and so become incensed with the injustice done to me.
[297:47.35]I'm going to get a life story here.
[297:50.59]I am by training a natural philosopher, but condemned by the jealousy of the thick-headed doctors of my university to make my living as an intern surgeon.
[297:59.38]Hired by a merchant to cure his son.
[298:02.02]Son fell into a coma after they fell from their balcony.
[298:07.33]I successfully trepanned the patient's skull to reduce the cranial swelling.
[298:15.23]They didn't listen to me.
[298:16.49]I said, take the willow bark.
[298:17.53]They didn't listen.
[298:18.93]And the guy died.
[298:20.45]The father, rather than reward me for my efforts, charged me with sorcery, such as the ignorance and gratitude of mankind.
[298:30.98]I'm anxious to move on.
[298:35.78]I'm a surgeon, not some silk-robed university physician.
[298:38.96]I can get my hands dirty.
[298:41.91]I treated every variety of wound.
[298:45.23]Yeah, get the fuck over here.
[298:48.73]Okay, we got a healer.
[298:54.36]Pretty cool.
[298:56.98]Tavern Keeper.
[298:59.84]I like to buy every man who comes in here.
[299:01.32]Have you heard of anyone in this realm who might need, uh, have a job?
[299:04.76]No.
[299:09.08]Uh, you have any from mercenaries?
[299:10.29]You mean three of my mates?
[299:12.85]No.
[299:17.35]Ransom broker.
[299:21.11]I broker ransoms for the poor wretches who are captured in these endless wars.
[299:24.34]Okay.
[299:28.64]You look like the type who might have a prisoner to sell.
[299:31.32]What can I get for a prisoner?
[299:33.58]It varies.
[299:34.10]I fancy that I have a fine eye for assessing a ransom.
[299:36.16]Okay.
[299:43.99]Now, what if their families can't pay?
[299:48.45]He's surprised what sorts of treasures a peasant can dig out of his cowshed or wheedle out of his cousins.
[299:54.02]So he's got the proper motivation.
[299:59.53]Would you ransom me if I were taken?
[300:01.95]Of course.
[300:06.09]Okay.
[300:07.59]I'd like to ransom one of my companions.
[300:12.87]What?
[300:14.49]Oh, I got prisoners to send the guy that I just talked to?
[300:17.87]Hey, come join my troop of merry men!
[300:22.19]Okay, thanks.
[300:23.96]You can have this guy.
[300:28.97]Okay, price, 104?
[300:29.61]Yeah, take them all.
[300:33.79]It's 500 bucks.
[300:41.70]So there goes the prisoners.
[300:46.92]What is it that you do?
[300:48.66]It's a bard.
[300:51.35]I don't want to hear you sing.
[300:55.17]I don't want to know, I don't want to hear you fucking sing a goddamn sentence.
[301:00.84]All right.
[301:01.58]Let's get out of here.
[301:07.25]Let's do some selling.

[310:36.44]He's dead.
[310:37.02]You all right?
[310:42.18]You already have something.
[310:50.57]Uh.
[310:52.51]I need to... He needs to rest.
[311:11.29]That's my... What do you mean, that's my stuff?
[311:13.11]Wait, what?
[311:13.59]What are you talking about?
[311:27.87]Whatever.
[311:28.55]Alright.
[311:40.64]I can have my horse, too.
[311:43.76]Alright.
[311:44.02]Can I even use this?
[311:45.88]I'm a fucking loser.
[311:50.80]Alright.
[311:51.60]How do I move him?
[311:58.08]Is he... This means he's, like, in the back, right?
[312:03.92]If I put him back here... Yeah, he was already all the way down here.
[312:14.47]Okay.
[312:27.40]So...
[312:29.81]What level am I now?
[312:30.65]I don't even know what I was actually doing.
[312:35.61]Wasn't I waiting for that king?
[312:36.79]Okay, I was waiting for the king.
[312:39.30]To go from here to there.
[312:42.04]Where was it?
[312:45.22]I was gonna go meet with this guy.
[312:49.72]But then I said, fuck that, I hate this guy.
[312:54.50]So now we're gonna go...
[313:02.59]I have no idea.
[313:16.56]I don't know what to do.
[313:23.26]I guess maybe I could go back here.
[313:30.31]I want to go back here.
[313:31.56]I've done my diligence here.
[313:36.56]Where's the fucking king?
[313:38.98]Find the goddamn king.
[313:55.35]We're in.
[313:57.63]Go to the castle.
[314:02.68]Are you in here?
[314:04.74]No, you're never in here.
[314:07.67]You have like fucking fruit by the foot, chicken, apples, nerds rope, whatever the hell that is.
[314:12.99]You're never here.
[314:13.51]You're always at war.
[314:17.00]Always.
[314:37.54]All right, I'm just going to walk around.
[314:44.22]Do you know where anybody is?
[314:45.16]How's your life?
[314:53.30]Do the tournament?
[315:13.60]Jeremy, you realize the president doesn't spend all day in his bathtub.
[315:27.39]But at least you'll take a bath once.
[315:28.97]Talk to anyone in that faction.
[315:42.59]I mean, that's great.
[315:44.62]Where are they?
[315:45.18]Did I just have to run into one of their generals?
[315:52.25]This place is destroyed.
[315:59.12]And everyone's faster than me.
[316:22.18]I'm in the wrong country.
[316:27.11]No, I abandoned this country.
[316:31.47]I just bought a better horse.
[316:32.99]I just did that.
[316:36.33]Do I have to go put like four horses in my inventory?
[316:50.28]The king was there.
[316:53.42]Oh, there's a goddamn peace agreement that I had nothing to do with!
[316:55.76]Who is this?
[317:08.01]He was in the town.
[317:09.29]What?!
[317:10.43]I was just here!
[317:11.45]I was just here, in his fucking bedroom!
[317:28.36]Wrong town.
[317:29.30]What's the right town?
[317:36.00]Wasn't I trying to... I was trying to talk to the King Vagris.
[317:41.10]This is correct.
[317:55.04]Oh, look, there he is.
[317:56.56]Hey, you've come in here fucking 40 times.
[317:58.94]Good to meet you.
[317:59.74]I'm the king.
[318:00.68]Enjoy my feast.
[318:06.91]So I was walking around in circles as a fucking Monopoly piece.
[318:10.23]Sorry about that.
[318:11.31]What do you need?
[318:25.31]I don't recognize you.
[318:26.57]You have anything for me to do?
[318:29.48]No, I don't.
[318:31.02]I've come to offer you my sword.
[318:32.50]You're not known as a... You are now... Oh, you are known as a brave man.
[318:35.54]Okay.
[318:39.74]I am ready, my lord.
[318:45.47]I'm ready.
[318:47.66]Good, then repeat the words of the oath for me.
[318:49.76]I swear homage to you as lawful ruler of the kingdom of Vargas.
[318:55.53]I pledge homage to you as lawful ruler of the kingdom of Vargas.
[318:59.89]I remain as your loyal and devoted man as long as my breath remains.
[319:03.45]I will remain as loyal and devoted to you for as long as I shall live.
[319:08.41]And I'll be at your side to fight your enemies should you need to turn into a Monopoly piece and fucking be the thimble and go get Park Place.
[319:14.89]And I'll be at your side to fight your enemies and find Park Place.
[319:17.69]Finally, I will uphold your lawful claims and those of your legitimate heirs.
[319:20.44]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[319:23.14]Very well.
[319:23.58]You've given me all this carton.
[319:25.22]May you upload it at all as proper courage and devotion.
[319:33.75]Let it be known that from this day forward, you are my sworn man and vessel.
[319:37.94]I give you my protection and grant you the right to bear arms in my name, and I pledge that I shall not deprive you of any life, liberty, or properties except that by lawful judgment of your peers, by the law and custom of the land.
[319:49.46]Furthermore, I give you the thief of Ismerala with its rents and revenues.
[319:54.40]What the fuck?
[319:55.08]I just walked in here.
[319:57.38]I don't understand this.
[319:59.06]You're giving me all this land and all this money.
[320:01.79]I just had to fucking run behind you and find you.
[320:09.42]I have fief of Izmiroa with all the rents and revenue.
[320:13.85]You've done a wise thing, Carton.
[320:15.17]Serve me well, and I promise you'll rise high.
[320:17.13]Thank you.
[320:17.61]I have great hopes for you, Carton.
[320:20.93]I know you shall prove yourself worthy of the trust I have placed in you.
[320:24.46]And the reason why I did this is because you landed a blow on me during the tournament.
[320:29.64]I've got my eye on you.
[320:33.08]Thank you.
[320:40.66]What do you got for me to do?
[320:42.88]There are some minor errands which I need completed.
[320:45.78]But it would be more appropriate to give to one of my own men, not a sworn vessel.
[320:50.46]If a worthy task prevents itself, I may offer you a favor.
[320:57.38]My apologies, I don't know you well enough to take your advice.
[321:04.44]So, let's go collect some taxes.
[321:08.67]Thank you.
[321:11.94]Fuck out of my way.
[321:13.36]You know who I am?
[321:17.06]Oh, are you?
[321:17.89]I heard that you have pledged allegiance to our lord, King Yaruglek.
[321:21.37]I look forward to fighting alongside you against our foes.
[321:23.55]Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy!
[321:27.65]I want to talk to you in private.
[321:30.86]Hey, this king over here?
[321:32.44]Fuck him, right?
[321:33.64]Let's usurp him.
[321:35.70]I get 50% of the usurp, you get 50% of the usurp.
[321:39.36]We're both happy.
[321:45.25]Perhaps we can discuss this matter in a more private setting.
[321:52.58]I get to slurp 50%, you get to slurp 50%.
[321:54.58]Look, it'll be easy.
[321:55.24]I'll just throw a rock.
[322:00.12]Where's my fucking new town?
[322:02.51]Feef?
[322:05.13]Let's see the kind of property I got.
[322:07.71]Right here, right?
[322:10.39]Thanks.
[322:11.51]Thanks, King.
[322:13.05]I hereby give you a broken down piece of shit that has been looted and ruined.
[322:26.74]Welcome to the family.
[322:34.90]Can I do anything about it?
[322:39.08]The village has been looted and a handful of souls scattered as you pass through the burnt houses.
[322:46.14]I think it's time to fucking just slurp this guy.
[322:49.06]You know what I'm saying?
[322:49.92]I think it's time to fucking just slurp him.
[322:53.88]See, I'm... This is my house now.
[323:01.60]Now I'm gonna like launch siege weapons over to Sargoth right now.
[323:04.89]It'll be just like my favorite iPad game.
[323:10.29]I build up my troops.
[323:11.63]I spend gems.
[323:12.61]And then I launch a fucking siege attack on this guy permanently.
[323:15.21]He's not even logged in right now.
[323:16.79]Not even logged in.
[323:18.94]You're fucked.
[323:23.34]What the fuck am I gonna do?
[323:25.44]Let's just go hang out over here.
[323:30.45]I'm just gonna sit here for a week.
[323:40.34]Who's that?
[323:40.98]Who's that?
[323:41.22]Get away from my fucking town.
[323:52.33]It's fine now?
[323:53.01]I'm not going to listen to that.
[323:56.95]He's the owner of the castle.
[323:57.89]I'm the owner of this castle.
[323:59.47]I'm the thief.
[324:01.61]That means I own it, right?
[324:03.71]If you're the thief of a castle, it means you own the castle.
[324:15.13]Alright, is this thing good?
[324:16.45]No, not yet.
[324:20.79]So let's go to the Lord's Hall.
[324:22.55]Let's speak candidly here.
[324:28.29]Here's Mr. Cavill.
[324:32.28]I am Carton.
[324:32.98]I am Boyer, a vassal of Kingdom of Arran, the lord of Ismaril Castle.
[324:36.28]Well, I'm the lord of Ismarala.
[324:38.94]You pledge allegiance to our lord, fight bravely, and be rewarded.
[324:42.44]Okay.
[324:45.98]Do you have anything for me?
[324:47.28]Minor errands I wouldn't give to you.
[324:48.74]Okay.
[324:49.22]I think we can work together to advance our standings.
[324:54.86]This guy wants to work together.
[324:56.93]I can't think of anything right now, but we will have some items of mutual interest in the future.
[325:01.65]Let us discuss another topic.
[325:02.89]Very well.
[325:04.47]May I suggest a course of action?
[325:10.93]I'm out of here.
[325:18.54]I am wife to Cavill, mother to Harish, mother to Harris.
[325:26.88]I have no need for a champion, okay.
[325:31.09]Fucking uppercut him.
[325:42.83]Mother of...
[325:45.48]Why did they used to do that?
[325:46.98]Who's in the prison?
[325:47.98]Who is in prison here?
[325:48.78]Currently no one.
[325:50.16]I want to speak with them.
[325:57.39]Oh shit, no, I'm the prisoner now.
[326:01.75]Hey, okay, you're gonna let me out.
[326:04.07]I don't think so.
[326:06.43]That was a funny joke.
[326:07.13]Alright, you're gonna let me out.
[326:18.02]I just want to go check out my city.
[326:26.04]You almost spit out your chocolate milk?
[326:28.54]Get a refill!
[326:35.60]Izmirala.
[326:41.94]Come on, I just, I don't care how long this takes.
[326:48.99]Go find some tournaments.
[326:50.01]Not yet.
[326:50.35]I gotta fight some more bandits.
[326:52.29]And I gotta go collect mad taxes.
[326:54.57]You know what I mean?
[326:54.99]I'm gonna go collect mad taxes from this place.
[326:59.16]You know in Rollercoaster Tycoon how you get the thing where you can scroll left or right how much you want it to cost to go to the park?
[327:06.80]Oh, I'm gonna get mad taxes from this place.
[327:11.72]There it is.
[327:12.02]Let's go.
[327:12.30]This is my castle.
[327:19.38]Here we go.
[327:19.80]The poverty of this village is unbearable.
[327:22.52]Only a handful of people are strong enough to work in the fields, many of which are becoming overgrown with weeds.
[327:27.12]The rest are weak and malnourished or have already fled elsewhere.
[327:30.50]The draft animals have long since starved or eaten, although a few carcasses still lie on the outskirts.
[327:35.36]Their bones gnawed by wild... This is a slight, isn't it?
[327:39.96]Back in the day, if you got this kind of... Yeah, I'm gonna give you this one.
[327:43.25]This village.
[327:44.11]It's a great one.
[327:45.97]And you come here and it's all run down like this and all fucked up.
[327:49.13]He's laughing.
[327:50.59]I'm getting hazed right now.
[327:55.12]I don't like this.
[327:56.70]Fuck this guy.
[327:57.58]I'm gonna fucking slurp up that king real soon.
[328:03.39]The populace is indifferent to you.
[328:04.77]Let's see.
[328:06.27]Manage this village.
[328:08.29]The village has no improvements.
[328:12.15]I got money.
[328:12.89]Build a s- Okay, this is how you- You- Build a school first.
[328:17.62]Always build a school.
[328:21.16]I don't need like a big manor for myself.
[328:23.22]Build a school.
[328:27.56]They're gonna get educated.
[328:32.40]School increases the loyalty of the villagers to you by plus one every month.
[328:34.96]As the party member with the highest engineer skill, you reckon that building the school will cost you $9,000 and will take 93 days.
[328:44.14]Ah, how much?
[328:46.62]Man, it's a little cheaper.
[328:47.63]You know, man, it's a little cheaper for that one.
[328:51.37]What about a mill?
[328:52.79]That's cheaper for that one.
[328:58.81]Build a mess?
[328:59.53]I need an engineer.
[329:01.50]Should I level up engineering?
[329:05.95]Let me go walk around, just see how they treat me.
[329:11.21]This is mine.
[329:18.40]Just go get an engineer party member.
[329:28.10]Who's this?
[329:36.66]Hey, I want to buy have you seen any enemies around here?
[329:39.72]It's got a target on My good sir our village has been going through such hardships lately the harvest has been bad
[329:49.47]They took away... The merciless bands took away our seed grain.
[329:53.38]If we cannot find some grain, we will not be able to plant our fields, and then we will have nothing to eat for the coming year.
[329:57.96]How much grain do you need?
[330:01.02]Four packs of grain.
[330:03.24]I'll get it.
[330:12.93]I can't do that.
[330:15.39]Alright, I'll be back.
[330:17.27]You need grain?
[330:18.75]I'll fucking be back in ten minutes.
[330:20.89]This will show you just how good of a fucking guy I am.
[330:23.81]Your previous owner?
[330:25.62]May have put that on, like, a I'll look into it list.
[330:28.34]Not this guy.
[330:34.38]Wait.
[330:38.07]Oh, no, never mind.
[330:47.47]What?
[330:48.39]Owner?
[330:50.07]No, you don't even have a real city.
[330:52.89]I need a... I need a castle.
[330:54.37]This one.
[330:55.65]Be right back.
[330:56.07]Alright.
[331:06.32]Goods.
[331:06.84]We need grain.
[331:12.26]You fucking idiots don't even have grain.
[331:16.08]Really?
[331:50.39]The town of Dirim seems to be flourishing.
[331:53.41]There's a tournament going on right now.
[331:54.73]Alright, hold on.
[332:00.43]Don't fuck this up.
[332:04.63]No, no, no.
[332:07.11]I need to save it.
[332:08.17]I did just save it, right?
[332:19.66]Let's go.
[332:38.29]Let's go.
[332:39.62]Charge.
[332:47.26]He's wearing like a big ass helmet.
[333:00.24]He's left.
[333:02.24]Charge.
[333:02.75]Charge.
[333:03.13]Come on, charge.
[333:21.44]Nice.
[333:21.76]Nice charge.
[333:22.40]Charge.
[333:24.53]Charge.
[333:25.67]Charge.
[333:26.17]Charge.
[333:26.47]Thank you.
[333:28.97]Thank you.
[333:29.79]Thank you.
[333:34.05]Okay, tier two.
[333:36.25]There'll be two teams with three fighters each.
[333:45.58]No, no, no, no, no.
[333:46.44]The horse.
[333:46.80]I hate the horse.
[334:08.20]Fucking ran him over.
[334:13.39]I'd rather just get off the fucking horse, seriously.
[334:18.39]I know it's X to do the lance thing.
[334:20.17]I know.
[334:20.51]It's just slippery and awkward to do this.
[334:45.50]Did he block that shit?
[335:02.79]He let go of it.
[335:06.02]Do it in first person mode.
[335:07.84]That doesn't really help, though.
[335:10.92]Yes, it does.
[335:27.67]Uhh, there'll be two teams of seven people each.
[335:33.58]Gonna give you the bow.
[335:41.36]I'm the- I'm the yellow this time!
[335:43.56]They keep changing my colors!
[335:47.93]Okay.
[335:48.59]You're gonna make me a fucking archer?
[335:50.51]Really?
[335:51.25]Like, honest to god?
[335:52.45]You're gonna make me a fucking archer?
[335:55.35]Why?
[335:56.19]Why?
[335:56.87]Why?
[335:57.30]I have no other weapons.
[336:05.04]Why would they do that?
[336:24.38]You can pick up- yeah, but I- nobody died!
[336:26.37]I- I bow and arrow.
[336:37.48]I have 15 points in bow and arrow.
[336:41.38]4 damage.
[336:43.50]And I just- 5 people run up on me and I die.
[336:53.98]Tournaments are RNG bullshit.
[336:56.62]Are they?
[336:56.96]It's because it's a vanilla Mountain Blade warband.
[337:15.68]Fuck, just buy grain.
[337:16.72]I ain't doing that anymore.
[337:17.94]That's the only thing that, like, irritated me about this game.
[337:20.67]Is throwing dice in the air and picking a random character.
[337:23.67]In the tournaments.
[337:39.60]Give me some fucking grain.
[337:55.76]I got the grain.
[337:57.68]I wish I could just fucking... Just leave a wake of fire.
[338:01.50]No!
[338:01.94]Just relax and go back and give the grain to the people!
[338:04.92]That's all I needed, right?
[338:12.87]Four packs of grain.
[338:13.97]I've got five.
[338:36.02]Okay, here we go.
[338:44.10]I got the grain for you.
[338:50.53]What do you think of me?
[338:52.67]It's I, your noble ruler!
[338:54.85]It's me!
[338:56.37]How come you're not going, fuck, shh, what the fuck, he's here!
[338:58.45]Hey.
[339:03.35]Tell me about the village.
[339:06.31]They belong to you, of course, my lord.
[339:07.91]We mostly produce grain and smoked fish.
[339:11.11]Thank you.
[339:13.97]Carry on.
[339:18.51]Where's the elder?
[339:23.80]Alright, can we get the fucking wizard out of the way?
[339:37.19]I own this place.
[339:37.98]I could punch that guy if I want.
[339:41.18]About the task you asked me for.
[339:42.34]Yes, it made me progress.
[339:43.22]Indeed, I brought you four packs of grain.
[339:46.76]My good lord!
[339:48.74]You saved us from hunger and desperation.
[339:50.24]We cannot thank you enough, but you'll always be in our prayers.
[339:52.82]The village of Ismarala will not forget what you've done.
[339:55.04]Okay.
[339:58.54]Anything else?
[340:06.25]a hero any enemies no anybody in this villa I think of one whom I suspect would jump with the chance you could pay ten dollars for their equipment yeah okay
[340:34.98]I'm the lord that plays watch out for the axe.
[340:37.96]You ever hear of that one?
[340:45.37]I bring grain but I also have my fucking fucked up amusings.
[341:02.94]As long as you just deal with my fucked up bullshit, you will always be fed.
[341:06.90]You will always have places to sleep.
[341:18.59]Okay, uh, I need to do engine- I need some engineers.
[341:23.79]One point in engineering!
[341:51.33]Make... Cha?
[341:57.73]Did I put one in Cha?
[342:08.06]Where's our... trainer?
[342:11.46]Every day, each area with a skill adds some experience to every other member.
[342:14.36]Yeah.
[342:14.68]Hmm.
[342:27.51]Hmm.
[343:05.23]Why am I getting fail-fished?
[343:06.23]What the fuck did I do?
[343:11.85]What's with the fail-fishes?
[343:13.37]What's happening here?
[343:17.45]I wanted to put points into surgery, because I don't... That's a good one.
[343:26.26]Look, I'm not going to get fail-fished in my own city here.
[343:28.94]Okay?
[343:30.48]It's 22 of you that have a problem.
[343:33.79]Who's this?
[343:34.59]Eat them.
[343:35.55]Alright, let's go.
[343:37.15]What do I need?
[343:40.73]I need to do stuff with the king.
[343:41.83]I already have a guy with surgery?
[343:49.58]Somebody just said it stacks.
[343:50.52]Isn't that a good thing?
[343:52.86]Shouldn't we be happy about that?
[343:58.03]Alright.
[343:59.13]I... I need... What the hell do I need?
[344:07.30]How's everybody doing?
[344:07.82]Everybody's good, right?
[344:15.43]Where can I find an engineer?
[344:20.95]That is the real question.
[344:33.56]In taverns.
[344:35.12]In taverns, in taverns, in taverns.
[344:37.04]What is in taverns?
[344:39.60]A town?
[344:41.84]I-N-T-A-V-E-E-I-R-N?
[344:45.77]In taverns?
[344:46.31]I don't know.
[344:46.69]It's not on the map.
[344:48.79]It's a Telrog Verjaheg Fanada in taverns.
[344:53.13]I don't know what that is.
[344:55.66]That was so loud.
[344:57.48]I'm sorry.
[344:59.46]I forgot I turned up the volume.
[345:04.30]I'm sorry.
[345:08.04]I forgot that I turned myself up.
[345:10.34]Like, and I freaked out halfway through that.
[345:16.67]Actually fucking scary.
[345:22.91]It's a fucking demon.
[345:25.03]All right.
[345:25.39]All right.
[345:25.65]All right.
[345:25.93]All right.
[345:26.21]All right.
[345:26.55]All right.
[345:27.07]Relax.
[345:33.12]Visit the tavern.
[345:36.10]Show him the clip.
[345:39.10]Alright.
[345:40.07]Looking for an engineer.
[345:41.11]I'm an engineer.
[345:41.73]No, you're not.
[345:45.69]Traveler.
[345:46.93]Mercenary engineer.
[345:48.31]I'm an engineer.
[345:50.53]I travel a lot and keep an open ear.
[345:55.06]Let me see it.
[346:00.54]I don't know what that is.
[346:05.35]Jesus Christ.
[346:07.25]I don't know what that is.
[346:14.35]That is a cartoon donkey.
[346:19.14]Somebody animate that with me with like a big donkey face.
[346:32.13]How did I make that noise?
[346:33.07]I don't know.
[346:35.06]Let me try to make that noise again.
[346:36.10]No, I can't.
[346:41.90]I was going to ask you to look a bit down on your luck.
[346:44.06]My luck?
[346:44.52]You could say that.
[346:45.18]It was bad luck to be born a weak father who was marrying me off to a drunken lay-about who beat me.
[346:49.12]It was bad luck.
[346:51.16]I was taken by a group of bandits.
[346:52.31]It was my bad luck.
[346:53.21]The only one among them was kind to me who taught me to hunt and fight and inspired the jealousy of others who knifed him and forced me to run away again.
[346:58.77]Uh...
[347:07.24]Are you by any chance looking for work?
[347:11.46]I might be.
[347:12.00]I could certainly use the money.
[347:14.98]But let your followers know that I do not suffer louts and brutes.
[347:17.92]Anyone who misbehaves around me will quickly find an arrow in their gut.
[347:22.89]Don't shoot anybody on the first date, please.
[347:26.69]Thank you.
[347:28.57]Engineer?
[347:30.31]Okay, are you an engineer?
[347:31.29]Yes.
[347:36.93]I'm looking for an engineer.
[347:40.61]Who's up here?
[347:41.71]Nobody will see it.
[347:42.23]I'll throw a knife in somebody's head.
[347:43.22]I have to get my bloodlust out.
[347:49.84]I told you I'm a merciless ruler.
[347:52.62]But I'm fair.
[348:28.91]Can't do it.
[348:38.75]How about this mercenary?
[348:39.75]Hi!
[348:41.01]No, you know, I want the free mercenaries, not the people who are like, I'm going to charge them.
[348:44.72]No, no.
[348:45.94]Tavern Keeper.
[348:49.12]Anyone looking for a job?
[348:49.90]Okay, yeah, I know, I'm already on that.
[348:53.92]I heard that Voldrat has been worried about bandits establishing a hideout in his area.
[348:59.80]Okay.
[349:01.60]I don't want to hear all this.
[349:04.28]That's too many names.
[349:20.79]So, I wish to buy a town.
[349:21.85]Let me see.
[349:27.88]Six grand...
[349:30.85]What is the most expensive?
[349:31.73]I could do one of these right now.
[349:34.65]I don't need an engineer for this.
[349:35.65]$500 a week.
[349:41.70]This is a $10,000 investment for $500 a week. ...
[350:02.11]What do you mean that's not economical for me?
[350:03.43]I have 10 grand.
[350:03.79]What are you talking about?
[350:08.26]Oh, what?
[350:10.10]How did I lose that?
[350:10.74]What did I get?
[350:11.24]What?
[350:14.74]Go to a different town.
[350:18.00]That's because I just bought somebody, right?
[350:19.36]Alright, I want to go back to the king's quarters.
[350:33.07]The king said, come back sometime and I'll talk to you.
[350:38.24]That's where we're fucking going.
[350:50.99]Okay, do you have anything for me to do?
[350:53.62]No lord should have to admit this, Carton, but I was inspecting my soldiers the other day and there are men here who don't know which end of a sword to hold.
[351:00.79]I need someone like you to knock them into shape.
[351:02.99]You're a warrior of renown, Carton.
[351:05.33]Will you train some troops for me?
[351:06.61]I would be grateful.
[351:08.61]How many?
[351:09.88]If you can raise six Vagir horsemen and bring them to me, that will probably be enough.
[351:19.14]Give me six fresh recruits and I'll train them to be horsemen.
[351:23.56]Taking a weight off my shoulders, Carton.
[351:25.33]I shall tell my sergeants to send you the recruits and attach them to your command.
[351:29.49]I'll advance you some money to help with expenses.
[351:32.67]Here, this purse should do it.
[351:33.57]Thank you.
[351:35.85]Okay.
[351:40.29]Raise horsemen.
[351:42.81]You have 120 days to finish this.
[351:44.19]I need to raise six horsemen.
[351:50.68]What the fuck?
[352:06.16]Oh, okay.
[352:09.82]I have to level them up.
[352:16.51]With the training field right here.
[352:24.07]Let's go to the training field.
[352:25.17]Training field!
[352:35.09]Speak with the trainer.
[352:36.13]Range weapon horseback practice.
[352:46.60]Speak with the trainer.
[352:47.26]Hold on.
[352:50.54]All out here by yourself.
[352:51.38]Okay.
[352:52.66]Good day.
[352:53.06]You look like another adventurer who's coming to chance the yeah yeah yeah.
[352:56.54]Training field.
[352:57.18]I do have a few questions.
[353:08.79]I can't do anything.
[353:09.41]I can't bring them here.
[353:18.79]It's fucking bandit lair.
[353:27.46]Let's go.
[353:40.64]Don't announce yourself so... What are you doing?
[353:53.79]Okay, wait, wait.
[353:54.35]Everybody get... Follow me.
[353:56.95]We're going in two different directions here.
[354:02.42]I don't want that.
[354:03.16]Follow me.
[354:17.62]This is two guys.
[354:20.40]Who's dead?
[354:22.74]Wait, how did you die?
[354:23.94]What the fuck?
[354:28.96]You're getting shoot at?
[354:34.78]That wasn't even a recruit.
[354:35.64]That's fine.
[354:47.99]That's just not gonna fucking happen I wish I could get up here faster
[355:20.30]Okay.
[355:21.48]Couple more.
[355:25.22]That didn't hit him in the head?
[355:30.62]Oh my god, throwing weapons.
[355:35.13]Just, why even use them?
[355:41.65]Ooh, fuck, honey.
[355:44.57]Light lance.
[355:45.21]There's a lot of shit here.
[355:54.36]Take it all.
[356:04.93]They didn't even do anything.
[356:06.13]I don't think there's anything... Nobody even fought.
[356:08.05]None of these guys even fought.
[356:19.80]Can I spar with them?
[356:24.12]Go get more recruits.
[356:25.63]Go get a bunch more recruits.
[356:34.27]One.
[356:35.89]Oh man, okay.
[356:43.74]Should I fight them all?
[356:44.58]Am I gonna kill this guy?
[356:57.86]Did he learn anything?
[357:00.96]The training went perfectly.
[357:04.81]What?
[357:08.92]Versus three.
[357:11.56]Three recruits.
[357:33.15]They just, like, get up on you like fucking bugs.
[357:56.43]They're just, like, attaching themselves to me.
[357:58.02]They're like magnets.

[360:23.59]I'm the one getting trained.
[360:29.50]Ugh.
[360:38.72]This is a lucky swing.
[360:41.45]Broken clock is right twice a day.
[360:43.05]Don't let this guy embarrass me.
[360:59.89]I taught you well.
[361:02.71]Coming fucking bruises.
[361:07.03]These are the recruits.
[361:07.91]These are like fucking like just turned 18.

[361:10.83]Like, oh, father, don't send me into the fucking.
[361:13.57]I don't want to.
[361:15.07]You're going to do it, son.
[361:16.29]You're going to be a blacksmith just like your father.
[361:18.29]You're going to get trained by the best punching bag in the whole city.
[361:28.17]Oh.
[361:32.43]I got all my points are in like power throw.
[361:38.78]I have no points on any of the melee shit.
[361:50.10]Upgrade it now.
[361:50.86]Not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet.
[361:52.86]I'm gonna teach these guys a fucking lesson.
[361:54.73]Now that we're playing pool, I'm gonna pool shark you.
[361:59.41]Never get overconfident, fellas.
[362:11.16]All right.
[362:41.58]When your lord turns and runs during training.
[362:55.76]Alright, let's go.
[363:01.22]Let's upgrade them.
[363:05.61]What do we got?
[363:05.93]Recruits.
[363:07.35]Okay, so now they can be footmen, right?
[363:18.89]So I need... How many did I need to bring back to him?
[363:21.21]I need six.
[363:35.28]So how do they... What's the tree?

[363:39.68]Or to Skirmisher, then to Horseman?
[363:52.51]What about me?
[363:52.91]Do I have any points to put in?
[363:54.69]No, I don't.
[363:57.86]This is abysmal.
[363:59.96]Remember when we were laughing at the guy that had 50-50-50-50-50-50 at the beginning of the game?
[364:05.68]Who's laughing now?
[364:15.73]Your stats are horrible.
[364:17.15]I know they are.
[364:18.91]I know they are.
[364:51.61]Alright, we need to... Recruits!
[364:55.24]Come on!
[365:03.05]Get the fuck out of here.
[365:28.14]Okay, overhead attack seems very good.
[365:51.10]Really?
[365:51.38]Bring them all out now.
[366:09.29]Ah, it's too many.
[366:10.03]Too overwhelming.
[366:10.67]Too many people.
[366:11.17]Too many humans.
[366:11.75]Too many bodies.
[366:12.29]Too many people.
[366:12.85]Too many things in the way.
[366:13.79]Hey!
[366:39.29]Okay, we're gonna do it, but go back to three.
[366:57.01]It's like, what the fuck?

[367:02.36]Like, Jesus, man.
[367:06.84]Okay, where are my veterans?
[367:09.65]I got footmen.
[367:10.33]I have veterans here.
[367:14.38]I need six.
[367:21.66]Okay, they can kick the shit out of me for like 40 minutes, so I could care less.
[367:38.81]Oh my god, they're too powerful.
[367:41.43]They're too powerful for me.
[368:09.98]shield!
[368:10.63]It's the only one I have!
[368:34.62]Okay, one by one you'll learn.
[368:39.68]What the hell?
[368:40.00]Jairus is, what, eating fucking popcorn and watching this.
[368:55.65]I was holding right click.
[369:01.01]Ay yi yi.
[369:10.03]Let's take a veteran on.
[369:24.99]Okay, seven footmen.
[369:27.37]It doesn't even matter.
[369:28.95]Does it matter if I beat up, like, the weakest person in the party?
[369:31.30]Like, here.
[369:32.00]What if I just kick the shit out of Jeremus?
[369:37.32]Do I get points for this?
[369:42.85]Yes.
[369:48.05]We're seeing this from the other perspective, by the way.
[369:50.69]That's me.
[370:08.92]If I lose to Jeremis, I will delete my stream.
[370:15.78]You understand?
[370:21.68]Alright, we need some veterans.
[370:24.76]So then, horsemen.
[370:25.99]I need six of these.
[370:37.39]Put music on.
[370:38.35]What music would you like to hear?
[370:42.07]I'm not deleting my fucking stream.
[370:50.89]Why is he better?
[370:52.53]Why did you get better?
[370:54.25]You shouldn't have learned anything.
[371:11.89]Turn on any soundtrack.
[371:23.06]We only have to do this a few more times.
[371:30.32]Nice blocking, Geminis!
[371:34.88]Put on white noise?
[371:42.16]Save before I alt-tab.
[371:43.65]No, I'm not doing that.
[371:55.30]Okay, how do we look?
[371:56.32]Anybody else can level up?
[371:58.86]Footman.
[371:59.28]Veteran.
[372:00.94]Recruit.
[372:01.57]Footman.
[372:03.27]Warrior.
[372:04.47]Just, might as well do it.
[372:05.55]Alright, how much do you have?
[372:10.75]How long does it take to go from here to there?
[372:17.76]Jeremus hates my stream.
[372:19.02]This is determined to ruin my career.
[372:23.29]Do I get more?
[372:23.85]Okay, if I do Jeremus and Jeremus.
[372:29.13]Who's like a piece of crap?
[372:37.06]No, they're good.
[372:39.42]Archer.
[372:50.27]That doesn't count.
[372:51.29]Jeremus didn't get the last hit.
[372:53.49]That doesn't count.
[372:54.43]This character is so... I can't even tell you.
[373:00.93]Jeremus didn't... I didn't lose to Jeremus.
[373:03.15]This is Jeremus here.
[373:05.31]If I lose this one, then yeah, you could have some point here.
[373:09.83]He didn't get the last hit.
[373:10.93]Sorry.
[373:16.07]Let's try them both at the same time.
[373:35.19]Alright, we're good.
[373:35.95]Did they get more EXP?
[373:39.28]I don't know.
[373:39.62]I can't tell.
[374:01.21]More, more, more!
[374:19.07]Don't you dare!
[374:19.67]No, that doesn't count!
[374:33.18]It doesn't count.
[374:33.82]It's just 2v1.
[374:36.16]He's not even doing any of the work.
[374:37.34]She is.
[374:39.98]He's just accidentally in the way sometimes.
[374:43.36]He may as well be swinging around a fucking vacuum cleaner.
[374:45.64]Like he's not doing anything.
[375:00.89]Oh, that hurt.
[375:01.81]Alright, how we doing?
[375:10.28]He died to Jeremus.
[375:11.44]It doesn't even matter.
[375:22.27]You blocked him with your wrist?
[375:37.47]Get out of here.
[375:43.29]All right.
[375:44.31]Let's see who can level up.
[375:46.51]What do you say?
[375:47.69]Footman.
[375:48.33]Veteran.
[375:48.99]Veteran.
[375:50.88]I need horseman.
[375:56.30]So here's what we're going to do.
[375:57.48]We're going to get two more veteran.
[376:01.34]And I'm going to take the veteran into battle.
[376:02.76]They're going to be all the way up.
[376:06.96]Two more.
[376:11.53]Almost done What if they die?
[376:21.23]They won't die, I won't let that happen
[376:38.90]They're not all gonna die.
[376:39.88]They're all gonna be highly trained and highly skilled assassins.
[376:44.34]What the hell is he talking about?
[376:45.24]They're gonna die.
[376:48.83]Look, you don't even know what you're talking about, okay?
[376:57.67]Did these two gain experience?
[376:58.75]They gained five.
[377:01.56]They gained a dogshit amount of experience.
[377:06.84]Where's the music?
[377:16.48]There you go.
[377:16.82]There's your little fucking beak.
[377:28.93]More, more, more, more.
[377:38.81]Doesn't count.
[377:39.19]I was going to do like a clown song.
[377:47.39]What a baby gamer.
[377:49.55]Cha-ah!
[377:50.09]Cha-ah!
[377:50.59]Cha-ah!
[377:51.13]Cha-ah!
[377:53.27]Oh, what a baby gamer.
[377:54.11]Cha-ah!
[378:03.76]Last one.
[378:07.36]Why am I obsessed with clowns?
[378:10.14]I'm not.
[378:11.20]When was the last time you heard me say clown?
[378:15.60]You guys are the ones that are obsessed with clowns.
[378:17.20]I just react to the clowns that you guys bring up.
[378:22.42]Be dangerous here.
[378:52.81]Oh, you motherfucker!
[378:53.79]Get out of my way!
[379:25.85]How can he be this good?
[379:27.07]How is it possible for somebody to be this good at the game?
[379:30.03]He's got auto-block on.
[379:30.77]He's got auto-block.
[379:32.21]How could you be this good at something?
[379:33.79]He's got auto-block on.
[379:34.69]Don't let him tell you that.
[379:35.31]He has auto-block on.
[379:49.54]I think I'm starting to get that.
[379:50.40]This is kind of a fun game.
[379:51.58]I'm starting to get the hang of the systems in place.
[379:53.48]He's playing on easy.
[379:54.16]He's not allowed to say that.
[379:57.37]I'm having a fun time.
[379:58.73]I think the game is interesting.
[380:00.11]It takes a lot to... There's a lot of information.
[380:02.15]He's playing on easy, you stupid.
[380:03.85]I'm having a fun time.
[380:04.81]You're not on hard.
[380:06.45]I... Okay.
[380:07.37]I'm having a good time playing.
[380:08.91]There we go.
[380:23.70]I gotta do one more.
[380:45.18]Oh, wait, I can't lose to this guy.
[380:49.28]There's a specific criteria involved.
[380:51.22]Not gonna fucking have that happen.
[381:04.93]Alright, this is it.
[381:06.75]One, two, go.
[381:07.69]I need gamer assistance.
[381:12.53]And even if I did, even if I did, who cares?
[381:19.51]Even if I did, who cares?
[381:20.53]Even if I need gamer assistance.
[381:29.54]Doesn't matter.
[381:30.00]I need one more of these guys.
[382:05.52]Alright, last time, I think.
[382:06.74]That's probably gonna be it.
[382:21.72]And if not, then whatever, we're just gonna bring them into a battle anyways.
[382:32.25]There it is.
[382:33.75]Alright, we have six veterans.
[382:35.38]Get them to the top.
[382:38.06]Move them up.
[382:40.54]With me.
[382:42.52]So I got six veterans.
[382:43.60]I need to turn them into horsemen, and then I go back, and I've got even more favor with the king.
[382:49.95]What do we got here?
[382:51.47]Save that before anything fucking horrible happens.
[382:58.66]Twenty-eight.
[383:01.04]Looking for some bandits or something.
[383:07.50]Your relationship with Boyer Neelag has increased from minus two to minus one.
[383:16.58]Oh, right.
[383:16.96]The stupid cattle thing.
[383:22.79]Uh, it's 97 people.
[383:23.63]Nope.
[383:28.82]I need more men.
[383:30.32]Looter is right here.
[383:37.25]No, no, no, no, no.
[383:37.71]Those are mine.
[383:38.29]That's mine!
[383:38.75]Those are mine!
[383:39.11]Those are mine!
[383:39.43]Those are mine!
[383:39.75]Those are mine!
[383:40.07]Those are mine!
[383:54.41]Do we really need this many people for like six bandits?
[384:03.67]There they are.
[384:04.19]They stole bread.
[384:06.88]Send the entire king's army after those motherfuckers.
[384:17.30]These guys are not very good.
[384:41.24]Alright, yeah, that's a great sound.
[384:42.68]It sounds like somebody's pressing on the ducks.
[384:45.36]That meme video where they push on the ducks and they all go... No casualties.
[384:55.74]Alright.
[384:56.08]Thanks for your help, stranger.
[384:56.90]We have met properly.
[384:57.66]Heavy, what's your name?
[384:59.06]Carton.
[385:00.08]Well met, Carton.
[385:00.90]I am Chromic Noyan.
[385:02.58]Thanks for your help and I hope we meet again.
[385:03.84]I don't want that shirt.
[385:23.08]Uh, three recruits.
[385:24.18]I'll take them.
[385:30.04]Uh, didn't take the prisoner.
[385:32.32]Oopsie.
[385:42.57]Throw the rotten pork?
[386:01.84]Who's that?
[386:06.36]Tundra bandits.
[386:11.07]How many... what?
[386:17.33]Free rotten pork.
[386:18.41]You can boil it for long enough, it's alright.
[386:35.82]Holy shit.
[386:37.04]23 bandits.
[386:37.42]We'll level up from this one.
[386:41.74]You go faster.
[386:42.96]I don't know.
[386:43.48]I gotta buy an inventory worth of horses.
[386:48.46]Surrender or die.
[386:51.76]As you wish.
[386:52.26]Prepare to die.
[386:52.84]31 versus 23.
[386:54.74]There's gonna be a lot of experience points in this one.
[387:03.19]I've got my champions.
[387:04.52]I've got my Nord warriors.
[387:08.38]Bring it on.
[387:28.13]Didn't hit anybody.
[387:38.48]This fucking spam!
[387:41.40]Watch out!
[388:08.54]You've improved your proficiency in one hand!
[388:24.21]Your casualties.
[388:25.27]One recruit... One footman, who cares.
[388:28.75]Jerem is... He'll be alright.
[388:31.33]One veteran wounded, it's okay.
[388:35.01]Continue.
[388:37.29]Oh, do we have... That's when we do a scenario like this.
[388:48.16]One.
[388:49.02]Two.
[388:52.71]Unconscious?
[388:53.57]Just fucking dump him in a river.
[389:03.31]Okay, keep these guys in the back too.
[389:13.75]It's only 10 p.m.
[389:14.63]for me?
[389:14.93]It's 10.30.
[389:17.61]Currently 10.30.
[389:17.99]Alright, now I can relax.
[389:25.08]Although, I gotta sell stuff.
[389:29.94]Yeah, let's get some sales here.
[389:31.74]Where's the nearest town?
[389:33.64]Hurry up, hurry up!
[389:34.48]Where's the nearest town?
[389:35.32]Hurry!
[389:43.76]or it may sell.
[389:59.72]Bata?
[390:00.26]No.
[390:06.62]I know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna buy a couple of horses.
[390:13.05]Saddle horse and heavy horse, right?
[390:14.69]Just put them in here.
[390:25.40]Don't.
[390:29.68]Don't need them?
[390:36.18]It increases your speed up to six horses.
[390:40.49]If you guys are lying to me, I swear to God.
[390:44.99]480.
[390:53.05]So, I'm being lied to where if I buy horses in the inventory, my... My little, like, fucking pony collection is not gonna make me faster.
[391:10.25]That is a lie.
[391:13.84]No, it actually does make you bastard.
[391:15.52]It works.
[391:15.98]It's not worth it.
[391:16.92]It's not a lie.
[391:17.68]It's a lie.
[391:18.28]Okay.
[391:30.93]Well, I'm not gonna buy one.
[391:32.63]I already sold everything.
[391:42.33]How we doing on food?
[391:43.11]We got plenty of food.
[391:44.43]No, we actually don't.
[391:49.86]Get this, like, old fucking bread out of here.
[391:51.40]I don't want it.
[391:53.94]What?
[391:54.12]I don't want this fucking thing.
[392:11.39]Sell everything and become a beggar.
[392:14.21]No, why would I do that?
[392:16.03]All right.
[392:20.74]Character.
[392:21.56]No points.
[392:22.12]Yeah, I know Pathfinding does that.
[392:23.34]I already have points in it.
[392:24.14]I already put points in it.
[392:27.64]I get to throw rocks at people.
[392:34.21]I don't even care.
[392:35.17]I don't even care.
[392:44.71]Alright, so... I still... I need six of them, so I need to fight more bandits.
[392:52.09]Let's wait so people can heal.
[393:13.09]Let me see.
[393:13.37]What can you tell me about your skills?
[393:14.65]Alright, let me tell you.
[393:17.95]Okay.
[393:19.87]What's this guy gonna do?
[393:21.17]How about... Weapon Master.
[393:24.51]Engineer.
[393:35.24]Oh!
[393:35.96]Reset.
[393:36.34]I thought that was Intelligence.
[393:40.26]Like, Wound Management, right?
[393:44.82]First aid, wound management.
[393:49.11]Wound treatment, wounding.
[393:59.53]Wound treatment.
[394:01.60]Yeah.
[394:03.12]Surgery, he's got four already.
[394:04.46]First aid.
[394:11.16]Woundage is already there.
[394:13.02]How about first aid?
[394:14.74]Yeah, he's the healer.
[394:16.82]And he needs some abilities.
[394:19.24]How about one in each?
[394:21.84]What the hell should I give this guy?
[394:22.81]I mean, he's terrible in everything.
[394:35.83]Now he's a formidable force.
[394:37.21]Let me see your equipment and see what kind of formidable forces I can give you.
[394:43.92]Your gear sucks.
[394:45.02]You should be fucking ashamed of yourself.
[394:46.42]18, 19, 16, 27.
[394:49.39]Yeah, that's better.
[394:52.93]You should be ashamed of yourself.
[394:57.55]You can't even hold that?
[394:58.93]You should be ashamed of yourself.
[395:00.51]Alright, let's rest up.
[395:13.12]The lance is better on you.
[395:16.92]It'll be fine.
[395:20.64]Assign him to a group in the party screen.
[395:26.03]Assign to archers.
[395:30.29]He'll just hang back with the archers.
[395:38.33]Okay.
[395:39.43]We need... Hmm.
[395:40.45]Hmm.
[395:40.75]Hmm.
[395:41.13]Hmm.
[395:41.49]Hmm.
[395:41.85]Hmm.
[395:43.63]We need to go and explore and find some more bandits.
[395:47.18]Those are farmers.
[395:50.06]He didn't have a bow?
[395:50.72]He didn't need a bow.
[395:51.38]He's just supposed to sit back and do nothing.
[395:53.00]Like, read.
[395:53.56]What about, uh, Yslem?
[396:08.27]Oh!
[396:10.33]I made $7 this week!
[396:13.18]$400 from rent?!
[396:17.24]Okay, that's awesome.
[396:19.34]This game sucks.
[396:36.17]I'm kidding!
[396:37.71]You think I'd be playing this game for six and a half hours if I didn't think it was fun?
[396:48.91]Oh, let's see.
[396:53.98]Yeah, give me that lance back.
[396:57.28]Give me a tertimus.
[397:04.21]Light lance.
[397:05.03]It's mine now.
[397:05.87]Take your staff back.
[397:06.77]It's useless.
[397:07.71]You should be ashamed of yourself.
[397:08.77]Alright, bandits.
[397:12.76]Where are they?
[397:16.18]You played Getting Over for seven hours and said it was the worst experience of your life.
[397:21.46]Yeah.
[397:31.26]No, this game's fun.
[397:32.80]I don't hate this game.
[397:33.62]I think it's worth playing.
[397:39.52]I'm having a great time, I really am.
[397:43.42]Mod it with insane mods.
[397:45.49]Not yet.
[397:47.49]Dermot, what is that?
[397:48.29]Dermot's bitten by what?
[397:51.39]Dermot's bitten by a Raffenmaster.
[397:53.97]Engineer.
[397:58.25]What is this?
[398:04.51]Raffenmaster.
[398:08.03]When the hell did that just happen?
[398:18.09]Any volunteers?
[398:18.93]Yeah.
[398:20.47]So, let's, um... Hmm.
[398:24.91]I need to fight a bandit or something.
[398:27.74]Where even did I go?
[398:35.92]Declaration of war!
[398:38.73]Swadia has declared war against Rodox.
[398:42.43]I got nothing to do with that.
[398:53.75]Farmers.
[398:55.53]Oh, no.
[399:03.67]Bandits?
[399:06.02]When am I just gonna kick the shit out of one of these generals?
[399:09.98]That's what I want to know.
[399:15.04]Nobody there?
[399:21.41]Bandits.
[399:21.83]Where are they?
[399:22.27]I just saw one.
[399:22.85]Right here?
[399:23.22]No.
[399:23.94]Leave me alone.
[399:26.98]Get the hell away from me.
[399:32.76]Bandits.

[406:47.42]Uh, there's 32 of them.

[409:08.92]Where was the save?

[410:05.03]I did not do that.
[410:06.12]Game's broken.
[410:07.56]My control was broken.
[410:08.62]No fucking way.
[410:21.21]How the fuck am I gonna get up there?
[410:29.61]Can the horse not climb this, but everybody else can?
[410:37.10]Just kill them.
[410:37.82]Give me the fucking goddamn thing.
[410:42.98]Don't let this guy die!

[412:58.90]Okay.
[413:06.72]Let's go back.
[413:21.40]You have your horsemen in the infantry class.
[413:22.96]It don't matter.
[413:23.50]I just need two more horsemen and I can get out of here.
[413:30.00]Jesus Christ.
[413:59.32]Oh, I fucked myself forever
[414:25.80]They're not gonna come up on me like that again, are they?
[414:27.64]Are they still training the same six people?
[414:39.43]Technically, yes.
[414:41.05]In the most painful way I think possible.
[414:47.27]Alright.
[414:47.45]They're not good enough.
[415:08.31]How much more?
[415:14.77]We'll do Jeremus and a veteran.
[415:18.86]Training this way is useless.
[415:32.61]Once these motherfuckers get close enough, it's game over!
[415:41.30]Do this one more time.
[415:42.32]Fuck off.
[416:15.03]Alright, did we get it?
[416:17.83]Veteran.
[416:18.49]Shit.
[416:24.34]Do I have a level up?
[416:26.42]I do.
[416:29.76]Oh, it's... Okay, this is before Iron Flesh.
[416:41.39]Put the veterans into Calvary.
[416:45.29]Okay.
[416:53.50]So I'm at war.
[416:54.34]Does 18 deserters running from Jarl Iria's party?
[416:58.48]Track him down.
[417:01.88]I tagged it, right?
[417:03.99]I did.
[417:15.78]We're the Free Brothers, we fight for only ourselves.
[417:17.64]When I'm done with you, you're gonna regret that.
[417:21.45]Alright, let's go.
[417:21.99]Horses?
[417:30.91]Movement orders?
[417:32.23]Hold this position.
[417:33.47]Don't go anywhere.
[417:40.24]Everybody else, I don't give a shit whether you live or die.
[417:50.31]None of you.
[417:51.47]Protect the horsemen at all costs.
[417:57.85]I'm talking about me too.
[417:59.53]My life is worthless here.
[418:01.51]Just die.
[418:02.97]Just beat them.
[418:03.63]Even if I die.
[418:05.37]As long as the horses are okay.
[418:28.71]Okay, can I turn off the kill feed?
[418:30.77]Speaking of horses that are about to die, mine's dead.
[418:42.42]I'm dead.
[419:04.48]Who fucking cares?
[419:05.50]Just leave.
[419:05.90]Oh man, my- everyone's dead.
[419:10.50]Oh, fucking god.
[419:28.84]So, the horses have to fight, because the veteran team was with the horses.
[419:37.28]Get over here!
[419:38.03]Fuck off.
[419:39.61]No, no, no, no, no.
[419:46.77]I put the veteran team with the horses and I made the horses stay.
[420:07.94]Why is this guy so much better?
[420:11.53]They're all dead.
[420:13.13]The horses are dead.
[420:20.03]They're all dead.
[420:22.07]Speaking of dead horses, my horse is dead.
[420:26.72]So this is a fight.
[420:27.36]This is not a fighting game.
[420:29.34]What the hell was I thinking?
[421:18.07]Recru- okay, I'm gonna get a hundred and fifty fucking people.
[421:21.13]I could care less anymore.
[421:25.65]What the fa- what do you mean bandits?
[421:27.03]What do you mean bandits?
[421:27.99]What are you talking about?
[421:28.84]This is my town!
[421:36.24]There's twenty mountain bandits!
[421:38.14]Oh my fucking Oh my fucking god.
[421:55.97]You having trouble going across the bridge, you fucking dumb ants?
[422:15.22]Just get off the fucking horse.
[422:38.47]Good work!
[422:53.84]Uh, okay.
[422:55.82]This is my time.
[422:56.60]Why would I want to do that?
[423:05.04]One more horseman and I can be done with this.
[423:16.02]Can I, like, leave people here?
[423:17.12]Give me everybody.
[423:28.18]I'll take everyone, please.
[423:32.61]What are you doing?
[423:33.27]Your village is under attack.
[423:34.39]What the fuck are you... What are you talking about?
[423:38.13]I was just there.
[423:39.83]The Count Regus of Kingdom Swati is laying
[423:51.07]Why are you such a mess?
[423:52.66]Go!
[423:52.94]Oh, my fucking god.
[423:57.52]What is the... Give up or I'll ride you down like a dog.
[424:05.87]We will fight you to the end.
[424:06.71]Stay your hand.
[424:07.07]There's something I must tell you in private.
[424:11.38]Bah, I'm not in mood for whispering in the corner.
[424:21.94]Oh, God.
[424:23.90]88 troops versus this 76?
[424:27.21]But I need to get- I need my horses.
[424:34.45]No, this- everyone's gonna get stuck on the fucking bridge again!
[424:37.97]No!
[424:40.32]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[424:41.40]This is gonna be too messy!
[424:44.64]Oh, God damn it.
[424:45.52]I'm going down this fucking lake.
[424:47.18]With me, cavalry, with me!
[424:49.18]With me!
[424:53.76]This many people's not- Get off the fucking horse.
[424:55.63]Off the horse.
[424:56.43]Get off horse.
[425:10.30]Just everybody charge.
[425:11.24]I don't care anymore.
[425:36.34]Did somebody help me?
[425:43.11]You can't fight more than one person in this game!
[425:46.79]Do something!
[425:48.41]You fucking idiot!
[425:59.25]All the horsemen, all the horses are dead!
[426:17.10]I'm done.
[426:26.50]That was fun game.
[426:39.11]That was a fun game.
[426:40.57]I will never be playing it again.
[426:41.77]What a great game.
[426:59.72]Let's just get two armies and like flush them down a toilet together.
[427:05.06]The game.
[427:21.13]Why did I stop doing quests?
[427:22.24]I was in the middle of doing a quest.
[427:24.74]I was trying to level up my horses and then I...
[427:29.68]I was doing one!
[427:30.70]The beginning is tough, but it gets neat later on.
[427:52.92]I'm sure it does.
[428:01.36]The beginning of this game is shit.
[428:06.28]Is it?
[428:06.72]I- okay.
[428:26.53]It is if you're bad.
[428:31.93]I was about to turn the camera on and fucking rant into the camera, but I don't have any clothes on, so I can't do that.
[428:55.88]Well, it's been seven hours anyways.
[428:57.34]I'm gonna, I'm gonna, that's it.
[428:59.08]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[429:07.83]You had 120 days to do that quest.
[429:11.15]But why would he give me something like that?
[429:12.82]Why would you, for the first mission that you're gonna give me?
[429:16.34]Yeah, I gotta do this one in like a few months.
[429:19.02]No, give me like, I need to find like the assassin.
[429:21.58]Go, go like to the bandit cave.
[429:31.67]The whole, all of it's RNG.
[429:48.56]You became a lord too quick.
[429:50.06]You were like level seven.
[429:55.28]Well, it's not- He offered it to me.
[429:57.28]It's not- What?
[429:57.78]I'm gonna refuse it?
[429:59.44]He offered me lordship.
[430:10.18]Well, whatever.
[430:10.79]It's a good game.
[430:11.51]I just- No.
[430:14.83]I ain't playing it anymore.
[430:40.45]Starting as a lord is a grind skip.
[430:42.43]You weren't very well.
[430:43.11]How am I supposed to know that though?
[430:47.77]It's like the hold X to put the lance down.
[430:52.49]How was I supposed to know to do that?
[430:54.45]If I didn't have a chat of like 3,000, 4,000 people here, how would I ever know to press X to use the lance?
[431:00.55]Why the fuck would I ever do that?
[431:20.82]Alright, well then, I'm done.
[431:22.22]I'll see you tomorrow.
[431:24.69]We're gonna play I Spy tomorrow.
[431:27.97]That's a game more my speed, I think.
[431:29.73]I was having a lot of fun in the beginning.
[432:12.51]Anyways, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[432:16.65]We have some bits to go through.
[432:30.49]The first part of gameplay for Mountain Blade is just grinding for money to do anything fun.
[432:38.15]I... I don't... I didn't... I thought you... I... Alright!
[432:43.24]I should have had the wiki page open over here on the left the whole time.
[433:22.50]You just played it wrong.
[433:24.84]Well, that's just what happened.
[433:28.93]Alright, if you enjoy Mountain Blade, I'm glad you do.
[433:32.31]It's a very immersive, interesting game.
[433:38.83]I guess I didn't know what I was getting into.
[433:41.11]I thought it was a different game.
[433:43.96]And that's on me.
[433:45.76]So I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[433:46.50]Have a great night.
[434:03.32]And let's go back to the bits.
[434:06.77]So, at, uh, seven hours ago exactly, we had $10 from Miss Melon Tea.
[434:14.03]Thank you, Miss Melon Tea.
[434:18.27]Hey, Germans, this is my first bit donation ever.
[434:20.37]Recently, I moved back to my home country away from my fiancé, who I won't be seeing for months.
[434:28.54]I just want to say that both you and Chad have been keeping me great company through this tough time, and I cannot thank you all enough.
[434:33.82]Love you lots.
[434:39.70]Thank you so much, Miss Melon.
[434:43.04]And hopefully you can see them soon.
[434:49.49]It's a long time to wait, but... Glad to keep you company.
[434:54.59]Thank you.
[435:12.16]Let me see here.
[435:14.00]Hold on.
[435:14.35]I had to move this.
[435:19.83]One second.
[435:23.27]Thank you some guy for the 20 bucks.
[435:25.85]No meme video or Phantom of the Opera tonight.
[435:27.95]Couldn't find anything so instead there's a picture of my dog.
[435:30.90]Really?
[435:38.04]That's a cute dog.
[435:41.61]Let's take a look at that dog.
[435:51.16]Thank you so much for the 20 bucks.
[436:02.76]What kind of dog is that?
[436:12.37]Are you still here?
[436:29.91]It's a pug.
[436:31.35]I don't think that's a pug.
[436:42.56]Don't let dickheads get you down.
[436:45.65]No, there's nothing to do with that.
[436:48.63]But if you want a real talk here for a second, sometimes, like for instance, trying to play a game that is a huge learning curve, that requires potentially hundreds of hours to understand everything,
[437:04.40]And if every action from the first 10 seconds of in the game to be called like stupid and that I'm doing something wrong can get fairly aggravating.
[437:16.04]It just, it can.
[437:17.12]I don't know if we were joking around in the beginning, but if I click on the map wrong,
[437:34.18]If I don't go to the right place for the first ten seconds.
[437:45.65]Like the hyper, like, overdrive back seating.
[437:50.27]And I don't know which way is which!
[437:51.51]I don't know which way is correct!
[437:54.18]I got a blindfold on, and people shouting orders.
[438:18.97]And sometimes people backseat to get me to go in the wrong direction.
[438:22.05]It's like, fuck, well, if I went that way and it was wrong, but everyone, you know what I'm saying?
[438:38.49]Backseating for iSpy won't be as bad.
[438:40.81]I don't, I disagree.
[439:06.53]But anyways.
[439:15.04]Disable chat?
[439:16.08]No, absolutely not.
[439:35.79]Imagine having a chatless stream.
[439:37.45]It'd just be like, hey, it's me just sitting here in my room.
[439:58.66]But, not saying that that was like a huge issue tonight.
[440:08.75]But trying to learn a game like this is already frustrating on its own.
[440:24.66]It's been an issue lately though, especially this year.
[440:31.91]Yeah, I don't... I mean, maybe a little bit.
[440:51.14]Just secretly learn the whole game off stream and pretend you're just a god gamer.
[441:24.07]Oh, don't put all your points into throwing weapons.
[441:29.35]Yeah, but I'm talking about jokes aside, right?
[441:33.27]And that is actually a viable thing.
[441:34.93]Am I wrong to say that?
[441:37.29]That eventually, like, if you get lances and stuff and you level that up, that that's not, like... That's actually viable later on?
[441:46.66]It is viable, right.
[441:48.40]It's very viable.
[441:49.42]Okay.
[441:49.56]Okay.
[442:14.67]Viable but not for you.
[442:20.63]I think sometimes there's like a big disconnect between... Like you guys gotta remember, I have never played this game before.
[442:29.71]Ever.
[442:32.37]Some of you might have hundreds or thousands of hours in this game.
[442:34.92]I literally have don't even know what it is.
[442:36.56]It was requested that I play it.
[442:39.23]I have no fucking idea what the hell this game is.
[443:01.35]I'm glad you guys are enjoying yourselves, but you gotta remember I'm so blind that I don't know that doing something like that is... I have to learn it, right?
[443:32.05]he doesn't know the game is pretty complicated just play every game for a few hundred hours before streaming it
[444:05.73]And then I think, like, if I'm getting my ass kicked and all of a sudden it's like, holy shit, this guy sucks.
[444:10.68]It's like, do I suck?
[444:11.80]Fuck, I suck.
[444:13.04]I'm not good at this game.
[444:14.56]Am I?
[444:14.94]What did I do wrong?
[444:15.58]I'm doing something wrong.
[444:16.34]You're doing something wrong.
[444:17.22]I am.
[444:17.68]Fuck, am I?
[444:20.80]It's like a circle of me realizing something's wrong.
[444:41.52]Maybe start cracking down on it a little bit.
[444:59.79]Chat can be real toxic sometimes.
[445:01.84]It's pretty sad to watch.
[445:07.96]And it's like, and then I get like backed into like a corner and I'm like a fucking cat.
[445:14.88]And I'm like, I got like two claws.
[445:17.34]I only have like two fingers, just like... Toxic.
[445:54.26]When one guy was actually the whole guy all along.
[446:07.44]But I'm not going to harp on this anymore.
[446:15.61]And it sucks.
[446:16.25]I got really frustrated in the last, like, hour.
[446:18.21]And the first, like, six hours... The first, like, five or six hours were just, like, so much fun.
[446:22.75]I was having a great time.
[446:25.77]And then it, like, went south.
[446:27.83]Because of, like, dying to... Random shit and not having the right things and doing the wrong things and... Oh well.
[447:01.45]No, I had a great time.
[447:03.35]I did.
[447:13.28]Play The Simpsons Hit and Run.
[447:14.40]That's a stress-free game.
[447:26.75]You were level 6.
[447:27.53]I know, but that's... I wish I fucking just knew anything about that.
[447:35.84]It's alright.
[447:36.60]Whatever.
[447:37.10]I'll get over it.
[447:37.76]I'll get over it.
[447:38.40]Let's go.
[447:41.98]I'll get over it.
[447:51.47]But thank you.
[447:51.89]Some guy gave $20.
[447:52.39]Thank you so much.
[447:56.65]Jeremy, what's your target audience?
[447:58.36]Chefs and small animals, probably.
[448:17.56]Thank you, Sad Vega, for the $1.
[448:18.92]I had a dream last night about you, which is weird.
[448:20.68]I never dream about this kind of stuff.
[448:22.78]But I was over your house and you were drinking coffee with your stream live and spilled it everywhere.
[448:27.11]You had to go clean it up and were fretting because you didn't want the stream to stop.
[448:30.81]So I had to cover for you and talked to Chad about banal topics like the weather for 15 minutes or so.
[448:38.59]I could have used you a few weeks ago.
[448:45.43]Oh, I could have used you a few weeks ago.
[448:56.72]Oh, no, I dumped a whole entire coffee on my desk like a month ago.
[449:07.54]Where was your dream like a month ago?
[449:10.16]But thank you.
[449:10.64]Thank you, Alec, for the $1.
[449:11.96]Hello, sir.
[449:12.48]Hello.
[449:13.64]Marvesh Magali, thanks for a dollar.
[449:14.90]I found this video on Reddit.
[449:15.86]I think you'll like it.
[449:16.76]Is it a gnome?
[449:18.02]It better not be.
[449:25.94]Is the germa animated?
[449:27.02]Oh, I did hear about this.
[449:31.25]Let's see it.
[449:34.27]Let's take a look.
[449:40.83]Hey, you're not at the big buck.
[449:44.06]Yeah, I'm not buck.
[449:44.98]I think this is a ruse.
[449:46.14]You're saying it's a trap, boss?
[449:50.20]Yeah, I think it's a trap.
[449:50.98]Walk right into a trap!
[449:52.63]Yeah, there was one time when I was in a trap in one of my movies.
[449:55.93]One of you three is working with him.
[450:01.46]And then I took him over there and then we went and I shot him.
[450:04.94]That happened in one of my movies.
[450:06.96]Remember that one?
[450:11.81]Hey, be the best you can and put your pedal to the metal.
[450:19.25]What is this guy saying?
[450:23.83]Oh, yeah, I remember that.
[450:25.89]Yeah, I didn't... Nobody even knew who the fuck I was.
[450:32.07]I just kind of walked in and did that.
[450:38.67]That was a fucking gold... That was a Goldbergs.
[450:42.31]But thank you, Marvush McGally, for the $1.
[450:46.63]Am I going to play Apex Legends?
[450:49.57]Probably not.
[450:51.19]Probably not.
[450:54.16]I heard it's very good, though.
[450:55.68]I heard it's good.
[450:57.88]Thank you, Nate Lane, for the $2.
[450:59.29]These graphics look like GTA San Andreas.
[451:03.03]And do I know what a novice fighter is?
[451:07.05]God damn it.
[451:07.83]Why did I get so salty?
[451:09.21]Why?
[451:14.68]What the hell?
[451:16.66]It was uncalled for.
[451:23.18]I was having so much fun and I like rage quit the game and was like, chat's fucking mean.
[451:33.11]Chat like, I don't like it when they do that.
[451:40.72]God damn it.
[451:44.78]You're allowed to have feelings.
[451:46.02]I know, I know.
[451:48.22]I know.
[451:54.93]I wasn't here.
[451:55.51]On a scale of joking about anger streamer to Mario Tennis, how furious was I?
[451:59.39]No, not even.
[452:02.41]I wasn't even close to Mario Tennis.
[452:14.52]It's not being salty chat with me.
[452:16.18]No, but I also was like playing fucking dumb and...
[452:24.33]Alright, I'm sorry, guys.
[452:25.37]I'm sorry that I got salty and annoyed.
[452:35.95]You're allowed to be human.
[452:36.91]I know, but still.
[452:38.05]I don't like to have those moments where I'm actually fucking salty and mad.
[452:44.22]It doesn't happen often.
[452:45.24]Very, very infrequently does that happen.
[452:57.70]You were playing too jokey.
[452:58.76]Reminds me when you nearly rage quit Oblivion because you picked skills with Green Day.
[453:02.76]I know.
[453:03.26]Am I ever gonna do something normal?
[453:09.43]Thank you Divus for the two dollars.
[453:15.87]Thank you, uh, Noctil for the $1.
[453:18.15]I'm so glad you finally got around to playing Warband.
[453:19.97]I had to leave the stream early, but I hope you liked the game.
[453:23.47]Warband has a lot of mods, so maybe when you come back, you're gonna be fucking probably pretty disappointed.
[453:29.75]I hope you listened the whole time, because I did say the game was fun, and I liked it, but I wasn't gonna play it again.
[453:36.15]It is a- I made sure, even in my, like, most frustrated, I did say, it's a good game.
[453:41.37]It's good.
[453:42.78]I never said it was bad.
[453:47.76]I said it sucks as a joke, though.
[453:48.98]That was a joke.
[453:49.56]I was just making a joke.
[454:01.61]Anyways.
[454:02.67]Noctil, it's a very fun game.
[454:04.67]I'm just probably not going to play it again.
[454:06.49]It's very hard and complicated.
[454:09.01]And maybe I'll install the Star Wars mod and put it in.
[454:21.02]Would you recommend it?
[454:23.01]Yeah, I would.
[454:24.25]I would.
[454:24.71]There's a shitload of content, obviously.
[454:27.23]There's a lot of content.
[454:31.53]It's very cool.
[454:35.21]It's just hard.
[454:37.17]Hard to learn.
[454:37.83]Let's put it that way.
[454:38.49]Hard to understand what's going on.
[454:48.26]Thank you to Mostly Lost for the $1.00.
[454:52.96]Chat gets mad at you for choosing easy mode, but then also gets mad at you for putting points into useless categories.
[454:58.34]I don't get it.
[455:15.98]I don't see the contradiction.
[455:16.93]Well, the contradiction is the game needs to be potentially on easy.
[455:22.65]for those builds to work early, I guess.
[455:28.05]Were people actually mad at easy mode?
[455:31.25]No, I just got made fun of for like 40 minutes until I changed it.
[455:36.32]I shouldn't have even opened up the fucking menu.
[455:45.34]It was when we got to the Sea Raiders and I beat the Sea Raiders with only losing like two people and it was like, wait a minute, hold on a second.
[455:52.26]What difficulty are you playing on, you fucking MONSTER?
[456:13.22]Make chat the weakest wrestler in the next Jerma Rumble?
[456:15.82]Uh, I already did that.
[456:18.04]I've done that before and it came back to bite me because they did very well.
[456:22.32]They eliminated like seven people.
[456:29.95]So I'm not sure I want to do that again.
[456:46.98]Local streamer is peer pressured into having a bad time.
[456:51.10]I didn't have a bad time, though.
[456:54.26]I had a bad time.
[456:55.50]You know where it really started to unravel?
[456:57.98]When the king killed me.
[457:02.02]And when I turned into an archer and shot my own guy in the back.
[457:05.78]Because they changed my colors.
[457:08.46]That's where it unraveled, at about the five and a half hour mark.
[457:25.26]But thank you, Mostly Lost.
[457:27.00]So much.
[457:29.56]Thank you to Pepperoni for the $3.
[457:32.80]Hey, Jeremy, what's up?
[457:34.08]Love you and what you do, buddy.
[457:35.00]Do you have a chance?
[457:35.58]Do you by chance plan on adding sub badges for consecutive years beyond two?
[457:41.59]Yes.
[457:43.59]I'm going to do a little overhaul here with the graphics.
[457:46.19]I'm going to get some more stuff, some more animations, and some more sub emote stuff.
[458:02.41]Should be good.
[458:04.53]Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for a dollar.
[458:05.93]Jeremy, you're going to let Grandpa stream Apex Legends, that new Fortnite game.
[458:14.60]Uh, no.
[458:15.38]I've heard it's fun, but no.
[458:17.40]We've got iSpy to play.
[458:20.60]I'm like pushing the narrative so hard.
[458:25.30]Like, streamer plays Warband.
[458:27.89]Can't handle Warband.
[458:30.09]Rage quits Warband.
[458:32.37]Next day plays a video game designed for fourth graders.
[458:38.03]Like, can I make it even more clear?
[458:40.71]You know what I'm saying?
[458:46.04]God damn it.
[458:52.59]Just, I'm leaning into that one.
[458:55.26]People are going to come, because most people don't stick around for the end of the stream hangout.
[458:59.14]A lot of people just kind of leave, and they left with me being like, fuck, god damn, suck, fuck this game.
[459:03.38]And they're going to come, they're going to show up tomorrow, and I'm going to be playing I Spy Hidden Object Game.
[459:09.76]They didn't know I was doing that.
[459:10.96]They weren't here for that.
[459:24.16]Imagine though Nah, I don't think I'll play apex I haven't even played it off stream or anything.
[459:42.01]I don't really get I'm not really into those kind of games Battle royale there.
[459:46.38]It's cool, but it's not something I'm into
[459:52.75]I'd rather play I Spy.
[459:55.09]Hey, Creation the Cyborg, thanks for the dollar.
[459:56.67]I forgot to cheer.
[459:57.68]Whoops!
[459:58.92]Uh, hey Jerma, I was wrong about the sun exploding.
[460:00.74]It's gonna expand.
[460:03.00]And in 2050 a meteor will crash into Earth.
[460:08.12]And Yellowstone's gonna explode at any moment!
[460:11.68]Uh, that's pretty, that's pretty dark, dire things here.
[460:14.19]I don't know if that's all gonna happen.
[460:22.90]How does... Oh, the magma... Germany, you know nothing about magma on Earth.
[460:27.93]Tell me how does that work when volcano and lava come from magma and ice?
[460:39.62]Thank you, Tingy, for the $1.
[460:40.78]Metro Exodus comes out in a week.
[460:42.16]Are you still going to go through Last Light?
[460:43.74]No.
[460:46.00]I don't think I have enough time for that.
[460:48.92]I don't have enough time.
[460:52.05]I'll end up doing that like weeks or months later.
[461:04.99]And all the people asking about Ace Attorney... Yeah, I'm probably just gonna wait for the PC port.
[461:10.27]Because it's probably gonna be much better.
[461:12.47]I have the iPad one, and I was told explicitly, well, don't, that one sucks.
[461:18.62]It's buggy, it's broken, it doesn't look good, and I'm like, oh, okay.
[461:23.52]And hey, it's coming to PC!
[461:24.80]They're doing it like a PC HD port, right?
[461:27.38]But is it the same one?
[461:29.94]As the iPad one?
[461:31.50]Or are they doing it from the ground up?
[461:44.47]The iPad 1 is not the one to play first.
[461:47.35]Okay.
[461:54.93]Change all the models to Biaz.
[461:57.27]For a mod.
[461:59.53]I don't know.
[461:59.83]Thank you, GoGoMan, for the two bucks.
[462:03.05]They say not like this.
[462:05.61]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the one dollar.
[462:06.99]Your character is literally Shrek from Shrek 2.
[462:14.54]I think outfit-wise, probably.
[462:17.78]Not hair-wise, though.
[462:22.91]Captain Worgen, thanks for the five dollars.
[462:24.27]Jerm is playing Mount and Blade.
[462:25.63]This is a dream come true.
[462:26.73]Now you need to lead a regiment in the Napoleonic Wars.
[462:39.52]I don't know.
[462:39.88]I've never played it, but thank you, Captain Worgen, for the five dollars.
[462:43.34]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the one dollar.
[462:44.68]Hey, Germa.
[462:46.66]Why are you wearing a Shrek outfit?
[462:49.46]Everybody's on the Shrek outfit, huh?
[462:53.26]Thank you.
[462:54.30]Timmy Tim Tim, thanks for the one dollar.
[462:55.52]I missed the first hour and a half of the stream to watch a shitty anime movie, and I gotta say, it was not worth it.
[463:00.02]Love your streams.
[463:01.86]Thank you, Timmy Tim Tim.
[463:06.84]Sorry about the bad movie.
[463:10.56]Hey, Creation Cyborg, thanks for the one dollar.
[463:14.20]Uh, I have two ideas for Jerma Rumble battles.
[463:16.96]Floygan Brothers versus Ed, Edd n Eddy.
[463:20.59]Uh, and Shito, Sega, or Trico.
[463:25.37]Who's Trico?
[463:28.19]The dog, cat, alien, bird from Last Guardian?
[463:32.67]That's old, that's old.
[463:39.96]Trico.
[463:40.82]Oh, it is.
[463:41.38]Okay.
[463:43.49]I got no plans for who's there yet.
[463:46.79]Maybe eventually I'll start to think about it.
[463:50.84]That was two years ago.
[463:51.62]That was a long time ago.
[463:53.98]Combine, thanks for the $1.
[463:54.96]Hey Jeremy, how many times did you die to Ludwig and do you have any tips?
[464:01.25]Uh, I think a lot.
[464:03.71]I think I died probably like at least 10 to 15 times to Ludwig.
[464:08.89]Don't really have any tips for you because I haven't played the game in a long time.
[464:11.47]It's been a couple of years, I think, since I really last played it.
[464:20.71]Becky, flank tank for the three bucks.
[464:22.21]Didn't you say you were going to do an eye tracker stream?
[464:26.27]Or am I insane?
[464:27.60]Anyway, it might be fun for a more chill hangout stream.
[464:29.64]Is it going to be part of the Bionic Boomer?
[464:32.36]The Bionic Boomer stream will have eye tracker.
[464:44.97]So.
[464:46.17]The what?
[464:47.85]The Bionic Boomer stream.
[464:50.41]I'm gonna have, like, keyboard pants.
[464:52.80]Fucking, like, a virtual boy.
[464:53.98]It's gonna be nuts.
[464:57.08]That's still happening?
[464:57.84]Yeah, it is, just not immediately.
[465:06.81]Uh, thank you.
[465:07.35]Dead move with the three bucks.
[465:08.73]Uh, Swadian knights are OP.
[465:10.15]Level up your Swadians to them.
[465:15.78]Thank you for the tip.
[465:19.93]Thank you, Creation Cyborg, again for a dollar.
[465:21.47]Hey, Jeremy, I found a movie scene that has where the sun explodes and vaporizes anything.
[465:28.45]You can show chat if you want.
[465:29.69]I don't think I want to see that.
[465:31.81]I don't want to see into the future how we're going to be vaporized.
[465:41.46]I don't want to see that.
[465:43.00]That's scary.
[465:44.78]That's a scary thing.
[465:48.65]And it might be a spoiler.
[465:50.57]Hey, Wizard Ribbit, thanks for the $1.
[465:51.99]Plays game on easy mode.
[465:53.23]Boasts about victory with two times the amount of units.
[465:57.94]You gotta take your victories where you can.
[466:06.52]Meefpleeple, thanks for the $1.
[466:08.43]Jerma only reads big bits because he hates poor people.
[466:11.49]What?! !
[466:15.36]No, I read the big bits because that's a huge monetary commitment and it's the same reason why I try to catch the big community subs too.
[466:28.73]That's like a massive drop of money that I want to address it immediately.
[466:36.39]That's a lot.
[466:43.65]Can't explain himself.
[466:44.57]I just explained it.
[466:48.41]He's nervous.
[466:49.67]What are you talking about?
[467:01.82]I can hear him sweating.
[467:02.94]Oh, yeah?
[467:03.32]Can you?
[467:04.44]I put my armpit up to the mic.
[467:06.88]You didn't hear shit.
[467:10.36]But thank you, Meeple.
[467:11.88]Thank you, Plutonium, for the $1.
[467:13.22]Who is this internet funny man?
[467:14.42]Hey!
[467:16.00]Thank you, Plutonium, again, for three more dollars.
[467:18.46]Eat his kids.
[467:19.72]Did you make your character so disastrous that enemies run from you?
[467:24.72]The character sucked.
[467:26.54]It's my own fault.
[467:27.64]Dead Moo, thanks for three bucks.
[467:28.88]Always pick die works.
[467:30.74]Seem good.
[467:32.30]Seem good.
[467:35.18]Wizard Ribbit, thank you for the three, four, five dollars here, Wizard Ribbit.
[467:39.77]To be fair, you have to have a very high skill level to understand Mountain Blade.
[467:42.52]The game is extremely hard, and without a solid grasp of siege theory, most of the enemies will trample a typical player's army.
[467:49.08]There's also King Harlow's buttery outlook, which is definitely woven into his characterization.
[467:54.13]His personal philosophy draws heavily from bounty-orifugal literature, for instance.
[468:00.81]The real gamers understand this stuff.
[468:02.35]They have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depth of this game.
[468:07.11]What it realizes is not just hard, it says something deep about gaming.
[468:10.62]As a consequence, the people who dislike Mountain Blade truly are not gamers.
[468:14.80]Of course, they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humor in the Sea Raiders' existential catchphrase, I will drink from your skull, which itself is a cryptic reference to Robert E. Howard.
[468:24.25]I don't know what the... This is the fucking Rick and Morty thing.
[468:29.78]I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those fake gamers scratching their heads in confusion as King Ragnar's genius tactics unfold on the battlefield.
[468:39.29]What fools how I pity them in like a crying, laughing emoji face.
[468:42.87]And yes, by the way, I do have my mountain blade tattoo.
[468:46.51]No, you can't see it.
[468:47.85]It's for the ladies' eyes only.
[468:49.31]And even they have to show their gamer license.
[468:52.00]They have to have beaten Dark Souls before.
[468:53.62]Another impersonal kid.
[468:54.58]Thank you.
[469:00.22]Thank you, moderately depressed, for the one dollar.
[469:02.58]What the fuck did you just fucking say about me?
[469:05.30]You ill, you bastard.
[469:07.26]I'll have you know I was promoted to top my legion in King Yargalik's party.
[469:10.50]I've been involved in numerous battles against the Swadians.
[469:13.16]I've performed over 300 confirmed scalpations.
[469:15.66]I'm trained in horse archery and in the top archery in the entire kingdom.
[469:19.04]You're nothing to me but just another looter.
[469:21.34]I'll wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which she's never seen before.
[469:28.49]How many of these were back-to-back?
[469:33.24]Thank you, SakaSazero, for the three bucks.
[469:37.16]If you didn't know, in battle, holding minus on the numpad zooms out view and looks better.
[469:45.56]I had no idea.
[469:47.67]The only thing the game told me in the beginning was how to block an attack.
[469:55.49]I didn't know anything else.
[470:01.15]Thank you for the three bucks, and good to know.
[470:05.20]Uh... Bertie... Bootree... Bootree Nipples.
[470:11.10]Thank you for the $10.
[470:13.35]It's alright if you turn it to default.
[470:14.93]If you aren't having fun, then what's the point?
[470:16.45]That was three hours ago, and now I'm, like, angry that I did it in the first place.
[470:31.36]Goddammit.
[470:33.00]It's not fun.
[470:33.62]Why bought it?
[470:36.18]And I was even defending myself, going like, who cares if it's on, like, easy mode.
[470:39.99]It's okay.
[470:43.71]I didn't figure out how the hell a lance worked until I was 200 hours in.
[470:49.11]See?
[470:49.89]Like, do you see?
[470:52.33]You didn't know how a lance worked until you played the game for 200 hours.
[470:58.43]You understand?
[470:59.03]What?
[471:04.97]What?
[471:06.85]I didn't know how it worked.
[471:10.17]Just rub it in.
[471:11.03]No, you and I are buddies.
[471:32.25]Literally aim your horse at enemies and hold W. Well, it's actually X. So that's not correct.
[471:38.53]So... The thing you just said was... It's holding X. Right?
[471:47.54]You don't need to press X. If it was on auto... You don't need to hold X. You don't need to do that.
[472:00.18]Wait, every...
[472:02.83]Everyone's lying to me.
[472:07.36]One of these days... This is going back, like, to what I was saying before.
[472:11.50]One of these days, my fucking house is gonna be on fire.
[472:15.46]On camera.
[472:18.44]And the cam's gonna be on, and it's... Behind me is gonna be burning.
[472:22.77]You understand?
[472:26.94]And I'm going to look over at chat and be like, house is on fire.
[472:29.78]Your house is on fire, dude.
[472:30.75]Not kidding.
[472:31.39]You're so stupid.
[472:32.13]What are you, a fucking idiot?
[472:33.15]Your house is on fire.
[472:34.05]And I'm not going to do anything.
[472:36.91]I'm going to go, I'm not supposed to be listening to you guys.
[472:40.65]And I'm going to turn and I'm going to play my Ninja Turtles, Turtles in Time.
[473:01.72]Jim, if that happens, a $50 donation would warn you.
[473:10.13]Your house is on fire.
[473:10.85]People are calling you a fucking idiot.
[473:20.69]I could... Can you be real?
[473:25.44]I could arm wrestle Hulk Hogan right now on my stream and beat him.
[473:31.88]And he could be like, And I, like, I beat him.
[473:36.79]I destroyed him.
[473:38.58]And I still would be, like, weak.
[473:41.22]I still wouldn't be strong enough.
[473:45.36]I could go on TV.
[473:46.68]I could go on live TV right now.
[473:48.97]Like on like CNN.
[473:50.53]And be awarded the fucking Nobel Prize for science.
[473:55.09]Because I like, I figured out, I figured out aliens are real.
[473:59.77]And I found out, I figured out the way to stop them.
[474:02.55]And they're interviewing me.
[474:04.05]I'm on CNN.
[474:05.21]The alien guy.
[474:07.51]And I did it.
[474:08.01]He's only got like 70 IQ.
[474:18.46]I figured out a potion that you can drink that reverses aging by 40 years.
[474:22.74]You drink it, and like Jim Carrey, you go back 40 years.
[474:28.04]He's not even smart, he's an idiot.
[474:43.31]Oh, now he's getting resentful.
[474:53.02]I bet he vaccinates too.
[474:55.42]Oh god.
[474:59.68]You would beat up a retired wrestler?
[475:03.54]I almost turned my webcam on again.
[475:04.92]I can't do that.
[475:13.40]Wealthy streamer talks for hours about how much of a victim he is.
[475:17.01]What?
[475:20.91]What are you talking about?
[475:31.55]Jeremy's gonna flash us one day.
[475:33.20]I already did, yeah, accidentally.
[475:57.35]I said arm wrestling.
[475:59.03]Him and I are like, you ready?
[476:00.39]And he's like, yeah, I'm ready.
[476:01.17]I'm ready.
[476:01.69]Let's go.
[476:03.65]Okay.
[476:04.22]That's what I'm saying.
[476:06.60]I'm not like, what?
[476:08.00]All right, let's go.
[476:20.97]Wealthy streamer.
[476:35.03]Were you a goofball as a kid?
[476:36.27]Yeah!
[476:52.16]Jerma, only a few of us are being dicks.
[476:59.84]God damn it.
[477:02.50]Uh, thank you to...
[477:07.19]Where are we?
[477:09.03]Oh.
[477:10.87]Uh, thank you Creation of the Cyborg for the $1 German.
[477:12.71]Did you hear about the Super Bowl?
[477:13.71]Didn't play Sweet Victory.
[477:14.79]Uh, yeah.
[477:17.33]I thought it was gonna happen.
[477:18.37]It's kind of bullshit.
[477:26.53]Alright, but, okay.
[477:27.89]It's only three people being assholes.
[477:29.73]It's only three people being, like, mean.
[477:33.17]Okay, so if there's a hundred people in a room, and there was a pot of beef stew in front of you,
[477:37.87]And one guy pees in it.
[477:40.03]Is he gonna eat it?
[477:41.63]Or is everybody gonna go, oh, come on, dude.
[477:43.87]What the fu- You're gonna eat that?
[477:55.32]I'm not gonna eat it.
[478:15.81]So am I doing it or is it your turn?
[478:34.16]I'm going to pee in all my food for the next week.
[478:38.66]Wait, what?
[478:39.22]No.
[478:40.34]Why would I do that?
[478:46.53]Alright, not very much left to go.
[478:49.25]Future Gamer, thanks for the $1, Future Gamer.
[478:50.79]I think it'd be fun to have a multiplayer stream of this where we get like 200 people into a game.
[478:55.78]Why didn't we do that?
[478:58.34]Why did I even play the single player?
[479:00.80]What the fuck was the point of that?
[479:03.04]Why didn't we just do that?
[479:04.76]Why didn't we just start with that?
[479:05.76]Because it would crash, oh.
[479:23.98]They would have wrecked you.
[479:25.70]It's okay.
[479:33.76]Thank you.
[479:34.02]It's time for slime for the $5.
[479:39.30]100 other messages, but they're all true.

[480:10.62]Thanks for the $1.
[480:11.44]Hello, Jeremy.
[480:12.15]One day you didn't do the thing that everyone in chat wanted, but sometime later you made something better instead.
[480:19.35]What did I do?
[480:26.23]What is this?
[480:28.03]The dirtiest NFL cheap shots?
[480:31.81]I'm not gonna wa- I don't wanna watch that right now.
[480:34.73]No.
[480:38.46]Instead, I played Blitz the League.
[480:42.58]Break his back in half!
[480:45.28]Hold on, we got- We have to watch this right now.
[481:03.85]Dirtiest NFL cheap shots?
[481:06.55]I don't want to watch that right now.
[481:10.35]No.
[481:18.23]Break us back in half.
[481:19.89]That's right.
[481:47.07]Yes!
[481:47.27]Oh yes!
[481:48.23]I'm so involved!
[481:49.45]The scariest things caught by drones!

[482:16.86]That was fucking great.
[482:17.66]Thank you for that.
[482:21.30]Watch it.
[482:21.72]I'm not gonna watch that.
[482:25.16]I'm not gonna watch scariest things caught by drones.
[482:29.12]AKA, I went into like Premiere or Photoshop and added it later.
[482:33.21]I like breathed hot breath on the lens and then put the thing in the air.
[483:01.52]God damn it.
[483:03.02]Alright.

[483:33.54]You wanna fucking fight?
[483:34.28]Don't fucking come at me!
[483:35.58]Don't!
[483:36.70]It was at this moment that he knew.
[483:38.86]He fucked up.
[483:41.67]I did.
[483:43.47]I did.
[483:43.71]It was that exact moment, it was.
[483:47.89]I am Monk, thanks for the $1.

[483:54.20]Uh, this is gonna actually hurt somebody's brain.
[483:56.44]So I just wanna be aware, I, like, me looking at this hurts my head.
[483:59.88]So, only click this link if you are aware that this could cause, like, an instant headache.
[484:06.86]Like, it's gonna cause an instant, I'm just, I'm being, I'm being very, very real.
[484:10.54]This link that is gonna happen, just, if you, if you're sensitive, like, photo-sensitive, be fucking careful.
[484:15.38]Because that, like, actually hurts my head looking at it, and actually, I think, I think I, like, that's changed me forever, looking at it for five seconds.
[484:23.31]That changed my- that mutated my DNA.
[484:31.47]Uh, Jay Paul, thanks for the $1.

[485:17.39]Hope your tax fraud went well.
[485:19.87]Have a good night.
[485:26.29]What is the stream's title?
[485:30.89]Why is shirts twice?
[485:33.73]Why don't you guys ever tell me about my fucking messed up stream titles?

[486:34.74]I know there's a lot of people who really love this game, and I like just... It was a perfect storm of... It was a perfect storm of me being frustrated.
[486:43.82]But the game is good.
[486:45.12]I never told you that it wasn't good.
[486:46.65]I want to make that very clear.
[486:48.89]I do believe that this game is fun.
[486:50.93]I do believe that the game is good.
[486:53.15]It was a perfect storm of frustration that I had to get out.
[487:03.81]I scrolled down, couldn't figure out how to not buy one of your shitty shirts.
[487:08.59]Those shirts are actually fantastic.
[487:10.85]Some of the best shirts I've ever seen sold on Twitch.
[487:13.51]Or YouTube.
[487:14.05]Or any- anywhere!
[487:15.26]Any store!
[487:16.58]Any- in the world!
[487:20.90]What- that's awesome.

[487:28.33]$400 from rent?
[487:34.85]Okay, that's awesome.
[487:36.95]This game sucks.
[487:53.86]But that was not... That was me joking.
[487:59.21]Why did I do that?
[488:02.51]It doesn't, though.
[488:03.15]I don't want to, like, rain on somebody's parade.
[488:05.89]Because the game actually is fun.
[488:07.91]I'm just being... I was just, like, zinging.
[488:12.62]I was not... It was a joke.
[488:14.16]I really was kidding there.
[488:15.04]I promise.
[488:16.20]At the end, when I clicked exit as fast as I could, that was not a joke.
[488:24.50]It's probably the worst game I've played in a decade, at least.
[488:31.54]Like, honest to fucking god, how do people think this is fun?
[488:36.87]Seriously.
[488:38.87]Like, I'm sitting here right now, un-fuck- I can't believe that anyone would play this game and think it's even remotely interesting.
[488:46.69]See, every time, like, I hit the bomb.
[488:49.85]I click the bomb every time.
[488:50.85]Like, I'm not- I'm sorry, I'm just- I'm playing Minesweeper right now.
[488:54.19]The game's fucking dumb.
[488:57.43]Like, why is it on every computer?
[489:06.62]I was just kind of passing the time and doing bits and playing Minesweeper.
[489:10.42]I don't know why I didn't... I need to update that fucking game, man.
[489:14.47]Seriously.
[489:22.23]Hey, thank you, Big Fry, for the 10 bucks.
[489:23.83]First donation, but the game has little to no tutorial, so early game is really rough for new players.
[489:31.32]Yeah, I kind of figured that out firsthand.
[489:37.08]I got very upset.
[489:38.14]I got very mad and it was not nice.
[489:43.72]That's what I've heard.
[489:44.46]I've heard it's very rough to new players and it's very difficult and the learning curve is huge.
[489:53.17]But people were being very mean to me.
[489:58.43]Perfect storm of fucking potions that I drank.
[490:01.91]People were being very mean to me.
[490:04.23]Weren't they?
[490:08.26]Okay, like that's like such confirmation like just bias right guys People being mean to me right everybody say right say yes But thank you for the 10 bucks it is a good game it's very difficult when you first get in there though Sam watching stuff.
[490:30.61]Thanks for the dollar.

[490:43.25]That game is fun.
[490:49.91]Oh, there he is.
[490:51.93]Jerma the Victim, there he is!
[490:54.55]No, I'm just kidding.

[491:15.79]Thanks for the $1.
[491:16.53]No, Jerma, you have the wrong opinion.
[491:18.09]Fortnite is a trash game, and anyone who plays it is in the utter scum of the... Whoa!

[493:03.13]Here's a vid from the... from a Mount & Blade mod.
[493:05.55]You don't have to watch the whole thing.
[493:08.35]It's pretty funny and it might interest you.
[493:11.92]Team building exercises with... I feel like I've played this game already.
[493:18.78]This looks like, um... What was that game?
[493:21.76]The... the copyright thing?
[493:30.80]What was that game called?
[493:31.56]Where we had like 100 people on the same server?
[493:33.20]Holdfast, right.
[493:38.30]It's pretty funny.
[493:38.86]I'll watch it when we get offline here.
[493:41.80]Mount and musket.
[493:46.17]Thank you lobotomized teddy bear for the $1.
[493:51.43]Here's a vid from a mod of Mountain Blade.
[493:54.87]Wait, what?
[493:56.23]Oh, this popped up twice.
[493:58.19]Lobotomize Teddy Bear thanks for the $1.
[493:59.33]That's a nice head you have on your shoulder.
[494:01.01]Hey, thanks.
[494:02.39]Mostly lost thanks for the $1.
[494:03.53]You think you'll ever finish up Metro Last Light so you can play the new one?
[494:07.41]Uh, no, I'm not gonna play the new one when it first comes out.
[494:11.33]I'm gonna be pretty late on it because I do want to do Last Light and I'm not gonna do that for probably a while.
[494:16.23]So I'm gonna be playing Exodus like with 50 trillion ping because everyone's gonna play it on day one or day two and day three and I'm gonna play it like two months later.
[494:37.50]No one's going to play it on day one because it's on the Epic Store.
[494:43.73]You know what's funny?
[494:45.07]I have the Epic Store on my computer.
[494:48.07]Not because I wanted to go get it, but because I was going to do a Fortnite joke.
[494:51.55]And I installed that and Fortnite.
[494:54.55]And I haven't taken it off.
[495:03.46]It's too late now.
[495:06.36]But...
[495:08.55]I will not be playing Exodus on launch.
[495:12.03]Not until I complete Last Light, and that's something I have to do on stream.
[495:16.39]You know what I'm saying.
[495:18.98]Hey Superman, thanks for the $1.
[495:20.36]Hey Jeremy, I was wondering what you would have pursued if YouTube or Twitch didn't exist.
[495:25.44]Something with animals, something with computers, something with customer service.
[495:30.43]Not necessarily in that order.
[495:40.17]I did a stint at an animal shelter and I loved it.
[495:44.60]I would have done it for work if I could have.
[495:46.84]Something in that field.
[495:48.96]I like to talk.
[495:50.86]I just like speaking.
[495:52.32]I'm sure you've noticed.
[495:54.35]So something to do with talking for a job somehow.
[496:12.50]So a comedian.
[496:13.60]Nah.
[496:15.60]Probably not.
[496:18.36]Uh, but thank you, Superman.
[496:19.32]Thank you, Gold Ruby Production.
[496:21.14]Oops-a-daisy.
[496:24.16]Thank you.
[496:26.90]Uh, thank you, Creation Cyborg.
[496:28.62]The scene is only one minute.
[496:29.89]If you skip to the movie, it's basically a thriller movie with Nicolas Cage trying to save as much people as he can when aliens try and... Is this the sun thing again?
[496:40.07]And when he refuses, it's... Hold on.
[496:42.13]I don't want to read, like, spoilers for a Nicolas Cage movie.
[496:48.73]Nicolas Cage.
[496:50.05]And the sun explodes.
[496:52.57]What movie is that?
[496:58.25]The movie sucks.
[497:08.50]Apocalypse?
[497:12.37]Just watch it.
[497:13.11]I don't- I'm not watching the Nicolas Cage son- I'm gonna get- I'm not going to jail.
[497:21.81]Thank you future gamer for the one dollar.
[497:23.36]You missed the second part of my bits earlier.
[497:24.78]Uh, Kraken played a cool warba- warband mod called Total Invasion.
[497:30.40]It's like 10- 100 to 150 players versus giant ogres.
[497:34.84]Skeletons and- Why did I play the regular game?
[497:41.43]I played like the hard learning curve campaign.
[497:55.30]Why didn't anybody tell me my ass was so big?
[498:11.63]One person got it.
[498:12.31]That's all I care about.
[498:14.97]Hey, James!
[498:15.57]Thank you, James, for the $5.
[498:16.21]Hey, Jerv, I've been a fan since your early YouTube days.
[498:18.59]Just want to say you've been such an inspiration and you give me such joy and I thought it's about time to show my gratitude.
[498:24.32]Thank you, James, for the $5.
[498:28.44]Thank you so much.
[498:31.16]I'm happy you have fun here and I'm humbled and shocked that I'm an inspiration to you.
[498:36.94]Thank you.
[498:38.52]I hope it's a good inspiration.
[498:39.78]Thank you so much.
[498:41.57]Hey, Novi333 with 333 bits.
[498:44.63]I missed almost the whole stream, but it sounds like the VOD is going to be pretty entertaining.
[498:49.78]It's... I had a lot of fun.
[498:52.98]It was a very fun game.
[498:54.30]What an experience.
[498:55.12]Thank you for the $3.33.
[499:00.84]Hey, James.
[499:01.32]Thanks for the $1 again.
[499:02.18]Hey, here's some goofy fan art inspired by the Condemn stream way back.
[499:09.33]Uh, unfortunately, this link, uh, is private.
[499:13.61]The account is private.
[499:14.89]I can't see what it is.
[499:15.97]I cannot click that link, I'm sorry, James.
[499:22.15]Thank you so much for any fan art.
[499:28.43]Maybe, uh, maybe you can throw it up on some, like, a Twitter or something or a different link.
[499:37.66]Sorry about that, James.
[499:40.49]Mostly lost, thanks for the $1, mostly lost.
[499:42.51]Also, if this isn't the new sub sound, I'm gonna have an extremely mild disappointment.
[499:48.02]Haverns, I don't know what that is.
[499:51.36]That was so loud, I'm sorry.
[499:53.54]It's like things I can't ever live down.
[500:01.02]Christian Cyborg, thanks for the $1.
[500:02.52]Please, German, this is all I ask, please.
[500:04.84]Okay, all right, fine.
[500:05.86]I'm gonna watch the sun explode.
[500:09.03]Everything burns scene.
[500:11.46]All right.
[500:11.82]Hey, everything burns scene if you don't want okay.
[500:15.10]Well, I can't even tell you it's a spoiler Here's a spoiler for the movie knowing with Nicolas Cage that the name of the scene is everything burns Okay, so this is probably the end of the movie the whole I'd everything burns.
[500:28.31]Oh
[500:34.90]so you're planning for retirement this is not all right what's this oh it's Peyton Manning retirement after planning for retirement oh retirement nobody buys that insurance nobody wants that insurance
[501:03.31]Why do you want me to see this?
[501:07.34]Why do you want me to see this?
[501:14.25]Okay, I don't understand Hold on so what you won't skip to
[501:33.56]Spoiler, if anybody's never seen this movie.
[502:09.84]I'm just trying to figure out why that's something we had to see.
[502:20.43]Wait, what?
[502:21.07]Go to the actual part?
[502:22.87]What are you talking about?
[502:44.76]Okay, what is it?
[502:45.94]What do you want?
[502:46.60]3.30?
[502:46.62]3.36?
[502:47.52]It's almost the end of the whole- I don't get it.
[502:52.31]Is this the Earth?
[503:26.81]Watch from here to the end.
[503:28.25]All right, OK, that's enough of this.
[503:39.61]That's enough of that.
[503:40.41]That's enough of that.
[503:48.62]Sorry, nobody can watch that movie now.
[503:54.82]My eyes fucking hurt from laughing at that.
[503:58.70]But why do we need to know?
[504:14.79]That was the oddest joke to take more than five minutes.
[504:16.93]I didn't set that up.
[504:20.17]I was told I had to play that like seven times.
[504:30.14]But anyways.
[504:32.30]Uh... Where the fuck are we?
[504:36.68]Um, okay.
[504:37.46]Thank you, Creation of the Cyborg, for the Sun video.
[504:42.20]Maybe.
[505:00.74]Maybe.
[505:02.26]It's in the bag.
[505:03.80]It's in the bag pocket right here.
[505:12.63]But thank you, Gondolin.
[505:14.77]Looks great.
[505:17.49]Creation of the Cyborg, thanks for the $1.
[505:18.65]The movie is copyright free.
[505:24.61]I would put any amount of Vegas odds that that movie is not copyright free.
[505:32.00]I would probably put any amount of money on that.
[505:35.28]It's probably very copywritten.
[505:37.22]It's probably incredibly copywritten.
[505:41.04]I don't think there's a Nicolas Cage movie that's in the public domain.
[505:48.79]But we showed it.
[505:49.63]We showed it.
[505:51.35]Hey, James, thanks for the $1.
[505:52.47]Hey, the link should work now, hopefully.
[505:53.75]And this seemed like the easiest way to link it, but obviously not.
[505:56.43]Whoops.
[505:56.79]Well, anyway, much love to you.
[506:02.19]Oh, that's... I know what that is.
[506:04.79]That's the HyperCam thing.
[506:09.43]That's awesome.
[506:11.73]That's the compressed HyperCam stream.
[506:19.58]Look at that piece of art.
[506:20.62]Look at that art right there.
[506:22.46]Hang that up somewhere in a museum.
[506:26.24]Oh, that's awesome.
[506:26.76]Thank you so much, James.
[506:27.44]That's amazing.
[506:30.11]Thank you.
[506:40.63]Ego maniac.
[506:50.56]You guys have a lot of fucking talent.
[506:51.88]You really do.
[506:52.34]I don't know what it is with just this community in particular.
[506:57.25]A lot of people that know what the fuck they're doing.
[506:59.03]A lot of people know what they're doing.
[507:00.97]A lot of talented people.
[507:08.03]Am I cool yet, mummy?
[507:09.25]Yes.
[507:11.07]Yes!
[507:14.03]And finally, Christian Cyborg, thanks, Jerma.
[507:16.40]Thanks for a dollar.
[507:17.82]Now you know how the Earth will die if it survives Mercury.
[507:20.30]Wish you watched the whole thing.
[507:23.68]No, don't worry.
[507:24.42]Some scientist is going to figure out a fucking flute they're going to play, and it's going to play a certain tone of music that puts the cylinder around the Earth, and we're going to be fine.
[507:35.17]But let's put the credits up.
[507:41.60]Thank you so much, everybody.
[507:45.16]God damn, this is a lot of people.
[507:47.14]How many people subbed tonight?
[507:51.88]Thank you, everybody.
[507:53.98]I had a lot of fun in Mountain Blade.
[507:55.31]It is a fun fucking game.
[507:57.83]Please excuse the last... The last, like, 42 minutes of the stream was kind of salty and annoyed.
[508:06.69]I don't like getting there, but sometimes it happens.
[508:09.73]Sometimes it just happens.
[508:17.68]So tomorrow... I will see you guys.
[508:22.46]I'm going to play I Spy.
[508:26.36]I Spy the children's game.
[508:31.63]I might not put the cap on Warband.
[508:34.43]It was just... I had to get out of there.
[508:38.87]I was reaching fucking... I was reaching the levels that were unquenchable.
[508:42.88]You know what I mean?
[508:43.30]I couldn't squelch them.
[508:44.50]They were coming up.
[508:51.98]Oh, the Haunted Mansion one, yeah.
[509:04.27]I've deleted three comments because they were too mean.
[509:13.95]With mods?
[509:14.63]Yeah, let's... I'm not going to close the book on it.
[509:32.95]That game has a lot of potential to be fun.
[509:36.66]I had to just drain the fucking water levels, you know what I mean?
[509:39.34]I had to put the spigot in my stomach and turn it on.
[509:42.06]Just hot water was coming out.
[509:52.10]Knowing was a video game at one point, but it was cancelled.
[509:56.98]I wonder why.
[510:05.73]That was very politically worded.
[510:07.51]That game had a lot of potential to be fun.
[510:12.61]I'm the son of a nobleman, I've got to say.
[510:26.54]In game, I was a PR guy.
[510:38.71]Let us pee.
[510:41.01]Uh... What should be more shocking to anybody is I think I only peed one time in eight and a half hours.
[510:48.33]That's a new record for me.
[510:52.46]Right?
[510:52.92]I only did one... I did one break.
[510:56.96]Holy shit.
[510:58.52]I didn't even realize that.
[511:03.94]Wow.
[511:10.54]I will see you guys tomorrow for I Spy the Children's Game.
[511:19.87]Thank you all so much.
[511:23.83]And then we was going to get a sequel.
[511:28.28]How do you get a sequel to a game when the sun explodes and destroys everything?
[511:35.88]But take care, guys.
[511:36.56]See you soon.
[511:37.68]Much love to you.
[511:39.36]And good night.
[511:42.41]Thank you.
