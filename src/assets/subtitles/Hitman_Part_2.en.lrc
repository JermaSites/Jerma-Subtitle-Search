[ve:60.16.100]

[01:38.51]Wait, what?
[02:03.22]Wait, what?
[02:15.58]There we are.
[02:18.86]So there's a new bit thing from my understanding.
[02:26.82]So now if somebody gives any bits, it stays in the chat up on the top.
[02:34.67]Because Killer Lance just gave 100 and it says Bitman.
[02:41.05]So I turned off the on screen
[02:46.12]Messages, I guess, that pop up when somebody gives a bit.
[02:51.80]So then that kind of replaces that, essentially, right?
[02:59.05]In a way.
[03:00.13]In a way.
[03:01.85]We'll give it a try.
[03:02.49]We'll see how it works.
[03:04.43]I don't know exactly how it's going to work.
[03:07.50]But give me one more minute.
[03:11.18]New bits thing.
[03:13.28]Yeah, it's weird.
[03:13.82]It's really weird.
[03:18.27]So I guess, like, uh, mods?
[03:21.84]I guess you can leave them there?
[03:23.70]For... a little while, I guess?
[03:30.68]I'm not sure.
[03:31.14]How come that one didn't work?
[03:35.54]Yeah.
[03:37.76]Hey, why did that one not work?
[03:40.50]Seems a little weird.
[03:47.27]Let me move that over there.
[03:52.51]And... Yeah, that would... How come some of them are staying and some of them aren't staying?
[03:59.44]Yeah.
[04:02.32]That seems kind of strange.
[04:04.67]Well, hi.
[04:05.43]Good evening.
[04:06.89]Hi, everybody.
[04:07.21]We're going to be playing some more Hitman.
[04:10.81]Wait, what?
[04:11.49]What?
[04:13.90]Oh my goodness.
[04:15.04]Already we got like a billion subs.
[04:17.34]And I haven't even said hello to any of them.
[04:21.46]The last one's supposed to replace the previous one.
[04:25.03]Okay, I see.
[04:26.95]Well, it seems to be not necessarily working as intended, I guess.
[04:33.09]Replace this.
[04:35.01]Wait, okay, you have to actually write a message, I think.
[04:42.10]Ah.
[04:44.22]Okay.
[04:46.28]Doesn't work on mobile.
[04:50.85]Well, we'll give it a try for now.
[04:53.45]No guarantees if it'll stay.
[04:56.53]Interesting, but I kind of actually like that.
[05:00.81]Because it lets the person's message stay there.
[05:05.44]Okay, see, I see meeps now.
[05:09.09]not enough replaced oh god alright I'm gonna have to like is there a way you can make it so people just can't like bump you out of there that doesn't seem that seems kind of unfair yeah nice replacement guy yeah because okay so it's the minimum amount of bits is what's allowed to be up there I can't set
[05:37.79]I can't set in the settings that pinned cheers have to be a certain amount.
[05:43.47]Hopefully they add that.
[05:45.75]Because I would hate for someone to be like, oh my god, here's 5,000 bits.
[05:50.26]And then some guy just goes, I'll get replaced.
[05:55.02]We'll give it a try for a little while.
[05:56.48]At least tonight.
[05:57.02]I just wanted to see how it worked.
[06:01.38]But thank you everybody for subbing and giving bits to test this thing out.
[06:06.83]Thanks, Meep, for the 365.
[06:08.27]Thank you, Meelinks, for nine months.
[06:11.13]I'm at nine months, Jesus, yeah?
[06:14.12]I can't believe I've been alive for nine months.
[06:21.24]Who else subbed here before we really get started?
[06:23.40]Dead099, thanks for the sub.
[06:26.74]Thanks for the sub.
[06:27.58]So many resubs.
[06:32.73]I'm going to have to say a huge thank you to all the resubs, because I lost track.
[06:41.40]There we go.
[06:41.94]I can't see them now.
[06:43.93]Lucas7151, Adaris Randelza, Some Audat, thanks for the sub.
[06:50.89]Those guys were two-month resubs.
[06:53.77]Beyond Names, Mr. Sandman.
[06:58.91]Uh, Dark Mustache Man gave 35 bits off.
[07:01.11]Thank you, Dark Mustache Man.
[07:04.21]Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.
[07:05.18]Welcome back, everybody.
[07:05.86]I can't believe I was born nine months ago.
[07:13.32]And then thanks a lot to Gag Reflex.
[07:15.26]DLF.
[07:15.90]Thanks for two months, dude.
[07:16.80]Love your stream.
[07:17.40]Well, I love you.
[07:20.39]Gag Reflex.
[07:24.55]Except I don't like you when I go to the dentist.
[07:27.83]Because it's hard for him to do any work.
[07:30.31]Especially when I have to do the bite thing.
[07:32.99]Where they fill your mouth with goo.
[07:35.79]And you have to bite down.
[07:36.69]And you go... But let's get going.
[07:45.20]I'm going to do Hitman again.
[07:46.10]I might as well tell people that's what we're doing.
[07:49.74]Oh, wait.
[07:50.34]Before I make a tweet saying that I'm streaming, I do want to make sure this is in sync.
[07:54.72]So let's go.
[07:55.36]Here we go.
[07:55.68]Gonna do a test.
[07:58.26]Here comes the test.
[08:00.74]Please let me know if the stream is not in sync.
[08:04.46]So it should be making like a little tick noise when I scroll over stuff.
[08:10.53]We in sync?
[08:12.69]Or is it like a half second delayed again for no reason?
[08:26.80]We good?
[08:27.28]We good?
[08:28.48]Alright.
[08:29.10]Perfect.
[08:29.60]Thank God.
[08:32.54]Looks good.
[08:33.72]That's good to know.
[08:34.40]Alright.
[08:35.54]Let me make a tweet and we will get rolling here.
[08:43.72]Can they just take everything out of this other than throwing shit at people?
[08:48.08]Well, that's pretty much what I've been doing.
[08:51.75]so my hitman experience so far is throwing heavy objects at people's heads I kind of am playing that game Todd in a way in a sense I gotta get a good uh good stream name streaming I was about to write Dark Souls 3. why was I gonna why was this gonna say that I watched like 20 ads to give you a dollar and get my purple square
[09:22.56]Well, thank you, Chernobyl.
[09:26.64]Or Cherno.
[09:28.54]Cherno by the library.
[09:30.34]Thanks a lot, dude.
[09:35.16]Alright, streaming hit the man.
[09:37.90]No, that's not even, like, funny.
[09:38.82]That's, like, super... Oh, look how ironic I am, right?
[09:40.88]Oh, hit the man.
[09:41.76]Let's just make, like, a... Favorite band, Gorillaz.
[09:52.68]I need a good, like, emote.
[09:54.82]What's a good, like, emoticon?
[09:58.52]Let's do, like, the thumbs up.
[09:59.38]Wait, what?
[10:04.07]You should do the thumbs down.
[10:05.31]Wait, what?
[10:14.79]Here's five advertisements.
[10:16.98]Hit dude.
[10:17.96]Should I make it, like, streaming Hitman?
[10:19.96]Any percent.
[10:25.24]No, I was going to write streaming hitman.
[10:27.46]Let's just call it what it is.
[10:28.94]No fucking around.
[10:32.26]You don't always have to be a funny guy.
[10:34.78]You don't always have to be a comedian.
[10:36.46]Every time I wake up in the morning, I look in the mirror and I say this.
[10:39.06]You don't always have to be a comedian, you know?
[10:41.32]Really, really mad and I'm crying.
[10:48.86]And like this clown makeup on.
[10:50.04]I'm just like, you don't always have to be the clown.
[10:51.74]I start pulling off the clown makeup and I leave the nose on.
[10:55.28]I leave the no zone.
[10:57.70]It's important.
[11:04.08]Okay, let's go.
[11:05.30]This is the new mission.
[11:05.98]We're going to start the new mission.
[11:10.60]It's called the Gilded Cage.
[11:17.03]And here we go.
[11:20.49]It's gonna be loud.
[11:20.97]It's gonna be loud.
[11:21.79]Uh, Demon Days is the best Gorillaz album.
[11:23.65]Do I win?
[11:40.78]Which, I'm at the cutscene, everybody quiet.
[11:43.50]...from the Moroccan people was facing trial for investment fraud.
[11:47.60]But early this morning, a band of heavily armed mercenaries freed Strandberg from his prison transport, resulting in the death of several police officers.
[11:56.59]Strandberg now takes refuge at his native Swedish consulate, in front of which crowds of angry protesters have gathered, demanding his handover to Moroccan authorities.
[12:06.26]We believe General Zaydan orchestrated Strandberg's escape to infuriate the public and spark nationwide riots, allowing Zaydan to impose martial law.
[12:17.03]Operating out of a field HQ at a nearby abandoned school, he will no doubt use the riots to depict the Rabat government as weak and inept, and persuade the general staff to support a fully-fledged military... Alright, we got the general idea.
[12:32.72]He's a bad guy.
[12:33.44]He's doing all kinds of bad guy shit and we gotta get rid of the bad guy.
[12:37.99]Come on.
[12:38.97]We already know the story.
[12:44.64]I was wrong.
[12:45.20]It's Plastic Beach.
[12:46.14]Well, I think Plastic Beach is...
[12:49.40]A very close second.
[12:50.38]Like, let's say Demon Days is a 98.9%.
[12:54.57]Plastic Beach is like a 99.8%.
[12:56.79]Wait, hold on.
[12:57.57]If Demon Days is a 99.8%, then Plastic Beach is a 99.7%.
[13:01.15]Hey, I was watching that.
[13:09.12]Let's get planning.
[13:12.62]How come I... Why do I always get... How come there's no more costumes?
[13:16.40]Do I have to unlock them?
[13:18.59]Because, in my opinion, hey, this is the guy that you look out for 47's the assassin.
[13:25.60]Or it could be, like, in the default level outfit.
[13:28.48]Why would I ever pick this?
[13:29.26]Look at this one.
[13:32.34]Concealed.
[13:32.96]I only have these.
[13:33.80]Do I have any, like, hitman bucks?
[13:35.85]Can I, like, purchase more shit?
[13:37.01]Am I just being stupid?
[13:41.01]Gotta keep coin.
[13:42.63]Fiber wire is dumb.
[13:44.29]I don't like it.
[13:46.25]Remote breaching charge.
[13:50.81]No, these are all causing too many problems.
[13:53.03]Wait, this one's new.
[13:53.97]Let's try this one.
[13:56.82]You have to play good for once.
[13:58.74]Starting location, I can pick my location.
[14:00.78]Oh, not yet.
[14:01.26]There's a lot to do in this game, it seems.
[14:07.11]Hitman bits.
[14:09.95]No cheer message?
[14:10.87]No.
[14:11.63]Okay, so because everyone kind of trickled in, I'll explain sort of kind of what's going on.
[14:17.29]So Twitch added a new feature where if you look up there, look at the chat, you can see that Ditto gave 100 bits.
[14:24.21]Didn't have a message, but gave a thanks to Ditto for those.
[14:27.00]uh whoever gives bits their message just stays on the top of the chat wait what so theoretically the reason why I had to come on the stream was so people could see it you know look somebody gave bits okay they can see it for a little while for like at least 10 seconds or so
[14:43.10]Now, it's just there until somebody else knocks them off with bits.
[14:48.24]I figured it's kind of redundant to have bits show up on screen now, like the message on screen, because it's going to show up on chat pretty much permanently until somebody knocks them out anyways.
[14:57.09]See?
[14:57.43]New feature.
[14:59.19]Broken Robin.
[15:00.01]New feature.
[15:03.51]Alright.
[15:03.77]Here we go.
[15:05.37]Let's just play it.
[15:06.25]Let's have a little bit of fun.
[15:08.64]Am I encouraging microtransaction?
[15:10.10]No, I'm talking about in-game, like I unlock shit.
[15:12.06]I don't know.
[15:15.74]That's the weather down there.
[15:23.27]You're an XP in-game, you unlocked it, which means you're going to be permanently level 1.
[15:28.19]Oh, God.
[15:29.11]Have I not leveled up?
[15:30.19]Because I have... I gotta, like, do it good.
[15:31.99]Welcome to Marrakesh, 47.
[15:33.19]There's so many people here.
[15:34.47]The situation grows more tense by the minute.
[15:37.17]The consulate is under lockdown.
[15:39.15]But the protests are only a stone throw away from full-blown riots.
[15:42.61]This is crazy.
[15:42.99]And Zaydan won't hesitate to unleash his troops.
[15:45.83]So whatever you're planning, time is of the essence.
[15:48.40]Oh god, I gotta get rid of him really quick.
[15:52.66]This game is crazy.
[15:53.76]There's so many things to do.
[15:57.09]Who am I sub-doing?
[16:00.47]Hey!
[16:01.23]Keep strangling that person and die today!
[16:03.95]Are you done, asshole?
[16:05.03]I just wanted to know who I was supposed to be doing that to.
[16:07.90]Hold it right there!
[16:11.67]What happens if I don't let go of him?
[16:19.63]I'm not even strangling him.
[16:21.09]I'm just playfully wrestling him.
[16:24.85]They killed him.
[16:25.84]They killed that guy.
[16:30.16]That was not a strangle.
[16:31.08]That was like a, come here, I'm good friends with you.
[16:34.20]Oh, God.
[16:40.50]welcome to marrakech it's been three seconds the situation grows more tense by them let me check also what did I want to do mouse and keyboard key bindings
[16:59.28]Use item.
[17:00.00]Where is... I just don't think it exists.
[17:03.66]I'm looking for fast save, quick save, and quick load.
[17:07.38]Does it exist in this game?
[17:09.04]It exists in every other Hitman game ever made.
[17:14.12]If somebody knows what it is, I would love to hear it.
[17:16.34]Because it is kind of annoying to have to press escape, hit save, and then pick a slot every time.
[17:27.34]Alright, let's take a look at some intel.
[17:30.56]We don't have any.
[17:31.38]There's no... Okay.
[17:32.20]Opportunity.
[17:32.64]Bad Blood.
[17:35.74]Cherry Blossom.
[17:36.80]Down the rabbit hole.
[17:38.28]Golden Touch.
[17:40.20]Honeycomb.
[17:41.06]Open Sesame.
[17:41.92]Primetime.
[17:42.56]Alright.
[17:43.76]It's either going to be Primetime or Golden Touch.
[17:49.02]I think it's going to be Golden Touch.
[17:52.21]Yeah.
[17:52.39]Alright.
[17:54.91]Eliminate two of these guys.
[17:56.25]Let's do Golden Touch.
[17:58.07]Alright there.
[18:00.08]I think everything's alright.
[18:03.84]Don't strangle anybody.
[18:04.90]I know that's a huge problem I have in this game is do not strangle people.
[18:13.10]Strandberg is a lunatic.
[18:14.76]No, he is capitalism.
[18:16.20]I mean, that's what we all want this day and age, right?
[18:19.46]Not me.
[18:20.26]That's a load of rubbish.
[18:21.54]He's poisoning this guy's coffee.
[18:24.18]This guy isn't even a bad guy.
[18:27.66]And I can get rid of him.
[18:31.36]It's my duty to snap every person's neck.
[18:36.54]That's why I have zero points.
[18:40.74]Because I did that.
[18:41.46]I don't even need to do that.
[18:42.74]But I don't know.
[18:43.36]I felt like I had to.
[18:48.57]Thank you, Mr. Sandman, for a thousand bits.
[18:50.87]Much appreciated.
[18:52.79]And how I've been doing things, at least when I play Hitman, is at the end of a mission, I'll go back and I'll shout out the subs.
[18:59.41]I figure it's easier that way so I can pay attention to the game.
[19:02.77]But much love.
[19:03.39]Thank you, everybody.
[19:04.96]Thank you so much, everybody, for doing what you do.
[19:09.03]And that's doing the subs and the bits.
[19:11.39]Wow.
[19:12.25]I love you all.
[19:13.13]No, for real though.
[19:16.85]Thank you.
[19:17.95]Can I get like lost in the carpet place?
[19:28.58]It's a pretty good place to blend in.
[19:34.66]This is insane.
[19:36.25]There's so many people on the screen.
[19:42.23]Like, I don't know.
[19:43.39]Previous Hitmans were good.
[19:44.85]Absolution kind of started.
[19:47.61]In the... Look at like a next gen Hitman game.
[19:51.69]To me, this kind of... This is the next gen Hitman game.
[19:54.35]Absolution was terrible in comparison to this kind of game.
[19:57.61]Yeah.
[19:58.41]Just because there's so much to do.
[20:00.15]So much to... So many places to go.
[20:02.36]So much going on.
[20:10.20]One of the guys is in there.
[20:14.50]Can I not go in that way?
[20:15.36]I need to, like, get, like, a massage outfit on.
[20:20.41]How am I supposed to sneak in here?
[20:25.67]This is like a riot outside.
[20:27.07]Can I just sneak in the back door?
[20:34.56]Oh, wait, view intel.
[20:39.01]I want to do this one.
[20:40.09]How am I supposed to go massage the guy?
[20:42.01]Can I just open the door?
[20:43.03]Is this like an elevator?
[21:03.49]What about just run in the front door and hide?
[21:08.36]There we go.
[21:11.40]This looks like a place.
[21:12.16]Let me save this.
[21:14.08]Wait, I'm gonna test F5.
[21:16.38]F5.
[21:17.38]Didn't do anything.
[21:20.75]Because I think I can vault over this, yeah.
[21:22.73]Alright, there's a security guard over there.
[21:24.57]What do I have for weapons?
[21:25.29]I got my silenced... I got my silenced PP7.
[21:35.54]There's this one crazy guy climbing over.
[21:39.62]Okay, above us then.
[21:41.64]Getting there.
[21:42.06]Let's see where these guys go.
[21:49.36]Oh, there's a door.
[21:50.04]There's a door.
[21:50.52]I can just go in the door.
[21:52.24]Oh, cool.
[21:52.96]Hi, door.
[21:54.88]And we're in.
[21:55.56]You made it.
[21:56.63]Most impressive, 47.
[21:57.85]Now to locate Klaus Strandberg.
[22:04.43]Okay.
[22:04.73]I'm going to go upstairs over there.
[22:08.84]I need a military outfit.
[22:11.72]Coin?
[22:12.06]Use the coin.
[22:12.56]Oh yeah, I have a coin.
[22:13.16]I forgot.
[22:13.90]I always take the coin.
[22:16.28]Alright, we're going to coin.
[22:17.12]Depending on where this guy goes, I can hide behind the Subaru.
[22:23.04]I'll be fine.
[22:25.68]Thank god that was a hose.
[22:27.50]Thank god that wasn't an axe.
[22:32.28]Hmm.
[22:32.50]Hmm.
[22:38.44]Thank God there's not a guy standing right there.
[22:41.52]Okay, he's moving.
[22:43.16]Where does he go?
[22:47.15]Yeah, I'm try- I- God damn it.
[22:58.23]God damn it.
[22:58.71]Right when I say there's no axe, they put an axe here.
[23:00.67]Are you sure like Twitch chat isn't like putting stuff in the game?
[23:08.19]God damn it No, I can't I can't save it in case I do it because I might Get off the fucking ring around the Rosie you saw the stream title I
[23:38.59]There's only three guys down here.
[23:43.39]As long as somebody pulls the alarm.
[23:44.55]Everything's a weapon to him, especially axes.
[23:50.03]What the fuck did that guy just say?
[24:21.67]Alright, get rid of the axe.
[24:24.89]No axe.
[24:27.25]The axe ended up being a good thing.
[24:43.16]So you saw that.
[24:43.94]The axe actually ended up being a good thing.
[24:46.68]It worked out.
[24:48.08]We're alright.
[24:51.87]Where do I... Can I stuff him in somewhere?
[24:54.71]I'd stand up.
[24:55.17]Don't be such a psycho.
[24:56.21]Where can I put him?
[25:00.73]Uh, wrench.
[25:01.91]Two wrenches.
[25:03.99]And one just isn't enough.
[25:04.99]Uh-oh.
[25:08.26]Uh-oh.
[25:08.66]Uh-oh.
[25:08.88]Uh-oh.
[25:09.16]Uh-oh.
[25:09.54]Uh-oh.
[25:10.24]Uh-oh.
[25:10.60]Uh-oh.
[25:11.20]You're a cannibal for this?
[25:13.54]Oh, shit.
[25:19.56]Broke his neck in front of him.
[25:23.30]Oh my god.
[25:24.98]Fuck off.
[25:30.09]Give me a break.
[25:32.73]I bent down and broke the guy's neck.
[25:35.25]I was going to smack him.
[25:39.51]Hey, let's check on him.
[25:44.65]God damn it.
[25:50.10]Can we please just get...
[25:53.19]And here comes a fucking car alarm.
[25:54.87]Is there a guy in that car beeping?
[26:03.92]I don't even fucking get it.
[26:05.14]I don't.
[26:06.64]If I didn't break that guy's neck, if I had a place to drag him, that car alarm's gonna give you away.
[26:16.05]No, no!
[26:16.81]Okay, good.
[26:18.96]Fuck this.
[26:19.92]Honest to God, just drop the damn thing.
[26:22.40]Right here.
[26:22.80]Just place it.
[26:26.08]You don't have to throw it to place it.
[26:28.40]You can put it on the ground.
[26:29.78]You can just put the fucking axe on the ground.
[26:31.48]Oh my God.
[26:34.10]What is with Hitman?
[26:36.40]What is with Agent 47?
[26:37.32]You can't just put something, place it on the ground?
[26:39.11]No.
[26:39.25]We're not doing this again.
[26:47.46]I have to carry the axe with me.
[26:54.00]It's Mafia 3 all over again.
[26:55.26]I have to carry the axe with me.
[26:56.62]If I take the axe with me, then I won't be able to drop it and make any noise.
[27:01.04]That's the problem.
[27:03.16]I can't do anything with this.
[27:04.42]Even if I drop it.
[27:05.00]Ready?
[27:05.16]Watch this.
[27:06.68]Oh, what was that?
[27:07.64]Did you hear that?
[27:11.34]He didn't hear it.
[27:11.76]Okay, good.
[27:12.68]We're good.
[27:17.12]It's so not sneaky.
[27:21.18]It's so shitty.
[27:22.96]I'm going to go down this way.
[27:24.56]No, I'm not.
[27:25.82]I'm going to do some fucking James Bond stuff.
[27:30.06]Okay.
[27:30.87]One guy there.
[27:31.37]One guy there.
[27:33.87]Bring out the coin.
[27:37.85]Actually, give me the wrench.
[27:38.91]No, no, no.
[27:39.57]Stay here.
[27:40.17]Oh, fuck.
[27:41.07]Is he coming over here?
[27:42.85]I'm going to have to throw a coin.
[27:44.01]I'm going to have to throw a coin.
[27:51.76]I just hit the ceiling.
[27:52.56]I just hit the ceiling with the coin.
[27:57.90]Fuck.
[28:02.32]I just like smashed into the ceiling.
[28:06.32]I was trying to throw it farther.
[28:10.39]I can't move because this guy will see me.
[28:18.25]Everybody go that way.
[28:30.93]Okay, I'm fine.
[28:36.99]Let's see what's down here.
[28:42.86]Oh, fuck.
[28:44.98]Oh, fuck.
[28:45.68]Oh, fuck.
[28:47.64]Open what?
[28:47.98]Open that?
[28:48.44]No?
[28:49.06]I'm freaking out because I saw that guy.
[29:04.07]Here's where I get the costume.
[29:09.19]Don't snap his neck.
[29:10.00]I need to find a place to put this guy.
[29:13.54]Right there.
[29:15.04]Easy.
[29:15.58]Done.
[29:21.16]That guy just was like... We're good.
[29:27.35]Give me your weapon.
[29:29.01]This is where I'll save it.
[29:30.45]Nobody will ever know.
[29:32.25]Look at that.
[29:35.48]He does have a brain.
[29:36.32]He's just not the scarecrow.
[29:40.74]Um... What is this?
[29:45.04]No, that's not... It's just a guy, and I'm in here with a guy.
[29:48.92]No, I thought I could, like, enter that for some reason.
[29:51.10]Okay.
[29:53.06]Um... Very far away from my target.
[29:56.28]Oh, shit.
[29:57.45]I... No, I'm disguised.
[29:59.25]It's okay.
[29:59.59]As long as I just stay calm.
[30:02.13]He won't care.
[30:02.57]See?
[30:04.03]We're good.
[30:05.72]If they have the little thing on their head, the white droplet, that's how you can tell you're in deep trouble.
[30:16.14]Mm-hmm.
[30:18.06]Okay, here's a guy that will see me.
[30:20.52]Why is he looking at me now?
[30:25.42]Is there anything else down here that I could do?
[30:27.04]Hold on, let me look at the intel.
[30:28.04]I feel like I'm in, like, a different part.
[30:30.10]Like, opportunities.
[30:31.26]I might see that down here.
[30:33.38]Track this one.
[30:34.20]Honeycomb.
[30:35.58]No, that's way too far away.
[30:39.06]Um... Bad Blood.
[30:43.76]How far away is this one?
[30:45.14]Way too far away.
[30:50.14]No, I'm gonna stick with the masseuse one.
[30:52.74]Cherry Blossom?
[30:55.61]No, not really.
[30:57.67]What the hell am I even doing down here?
[31:01.51]I want to do this one.
[31:02.43]This one's the one I'm going to do.
[31:04.01]But this guy just won't turn around.
[31:11.43]Keep at it, soldier.
[31:13.01]Keep looking at that wall.
[31:14.13]In case any specters come out.
[31:17.30]I need a coin.
[31:19.26]This guy ain't going to turn around, so we're going to make him turn around.
[31:25.48]I need to wait until he leaves.
[31:33.40]This guy is the only one that can see through my disguise.
[31:35.62]And I'm going to have to coin his bench.
[31:37.26]I'm going to throw it right there.
[31:39.06]Right up there.
[31:42.17]Damn.
[31:43.21]Yeah, damn.
[31:43.77]Go get it.
[31:46.97]That landed right in front of him.
[31:47.91]Are you serious?
[31:50.75]That guy just won the jackpot on a Plinko machine.
[31:54.14]Great.
[31:55.48]Perfect.
[31:57.99]Out of coins.
[31:58.91]No more coins.
[31:59.77]Good.
[32:01.19]Okay.
[32:01.89]That's exactly what I wanted.
[32:02.85]We're gonna have to throw a wrench.
[32:03.71]No, we're not.
[32:11.17]We're not gonna do anything.
[32:11.91]Fuck it.
[32:12.19]Let's run by him.
[32:13.99]Anything else in here that I need?
[32:14.93]There's a bunch of stuff on that bench.
[32:26.61]What's on that bed?
[32:27.41]There's so much stuff there.
[32:29.39]Look at all this stuff.
[32:32.53]There's like five different guns here.
[32:34.37]I have to get rid of this guy.
[32:35.18]I'm just going to kill him.
[32:37.28]Okay, I'm going to shoot this guy and then shoot the other guy.
[32:40.28]Look at how much fucking free shit there is here, guys.
[32:41.92]Are you kidding me?
[32:44.38]There's three people down here that are never going to be... I'm going to be able to get rid of everybody.
[32:48.83]Watch.
[32:50.35]What the?
[32:50.81]He's here.
[32:51.91]On me.
[32:56.78]What?
[33:06.50]Did... Okay.
[33:12.30]Sure.
[33:13.92]Yeah.
[33:15.08]Sure.
[33:16.52]I'll take it.
[33:18.92]Tartar right in the head.
[33:22.13]Somebody clip that.
[33:22.67]I want to see it.
[33:23.19]Clip it.
[33:23.63]Clip that right now.
[33:24.53]All of us are going to watch that.
[33:25.71]I want to see what happens.
[33:27.45]Somebody clip it.
[33:31.21]We're going to watch that right now.
[33:33.47]The first thing, I'm clipping that.
[33:34.75]We're seeing it.
[33:35.11]I want to see it.
[33:35.47]Let's see.
[33:39.72]I'm watching it right now.
[33:43.04]There's three people down here.
[33:44.42]Yeah, there's three people down here.
[33:45.96]I'm going to be able to get rid of everybody.
[33:47.50]Watch.
[33:48.99]I shot the guy right in the fucking face.
[33:51.07]Directly in his face.
[33:55.42]I shot him right in the face.
[33:59.54]That was right in the face.
[34:03.70]That's all I needed to see.
[34:06.16]I didn't miss it by a mile.
[34:07.00]I shot him right in the fucking face.
[34:12.20]That was like as much of a face in his nose that it could have been.
[34:19.88]That's okay, we're right here.
[34:23.78]Oh god, why did I say that?
[34:25.08]I'm gonna get like a thousand clips.
[34:33.37]It's wrinkly in his face!
[34:38.03]Zoom in and ha- I want somebody to slow-mo that clip.
[34:42.97]And enhance the shit out of it, add some more contrast.
[34:46.78]Add some fucking sharpness to it.
[34:49.16]Put a little bit more tint.
[34:50.70]And you tell me that wasn't a direct shot directly into that guy's head.
[34:56.10]I would never believe you.
[35:00.40]Missing a screwdriver.
[35:01.28]Well, we're going to try.
[35:02.00]We're going to do this again.
[35:08.50]This should be easy.
[35:11.41]In fact, I'm not even going to wait for the guy to come down here.
[35:14.09]This guy's not...
[35:16.25]That one worked.
[35:20.11]Got that guy.
[35:21.89]And this guy too.
[35:22.57]Here we go.
[35:22.89]Let's see if it happens again.
[35:24.51]What?
[35:26.45]You saw it.
[35:27.43]You saw it.
[35:28.91]It happened again.
[35:29.41]I hear a guy.
[35:35.45]Somebody just said command.
[35:36.91]Okay, I missed that one.
[35:41.67]I'm guaranteeing you guys I missed that one.
[35:47.17]Alright, I'm good.
[35:48.11]Now let's just rifle through this whole place.
[35:51.39]And take all this.
[35:51.93]Look at this.
[35:52.81]Lethal poison.
[35:53.59]Ooh.
[35:56.60]Schematics.
[36:01.54]New intel.
[36:03.24]Got the access codes.
[36:07.30]I want to do this one.
[36:14.47]Remote explosive.
[36:16.53]Damn, they're really making me... gearing me up.
[36:20.73]Chalking on the table?
[36:21.48]Yeah, but won't that give it away that I'm not a soldier?
[36:24.20]I thought you're not supposed to do that.
[36:32.04]Who just leaves poison on their desks?
[36:33.46]They're just psychos.
[36:36.78]Alright.
[36:37.00]I don't know where this is going to take me out.
[36:40.24]But I'm going to save it.
[36:46.16]I wonder who the boss is going to be.
[36:47.20]Nope, this is just a hiding place.
[36:56.01]Okie dokie.
[37:02.41]Where the hell am I?
[37:08.23]I want to do it.
[37:09.47]I want to do it.
[37:11.41]I saved it, right?
[37:12.71]No, don't do it.
[37:13.75]It's not worth it.
[37:17.05]What in the hell?
[37:20.25]Sir, please behave in an orderly fashion.
[37:25.13]That was not as cool as I thought it was gonna be.
[37:31.71]That guy died because I blew his eardrums up.
[37:35.11]That didn't actually kill him.
[37:39.32]Hide!
[37:48.81]And then I made a loud noise and he died.
[37:56.77]Anything else in here?
[37:57.59]Oh, free water?
[38:02.06]Where did he go?
[38:04.64]That guy was a real bastard.
[38:09.94]Coins.
[38:12.68]So many coins.
[38:14.94]So much money.
[38:16.08]Just robbing the register.
[38:17.10]It's awesome.
[38:21.33]Okay, is this guy right here that knows I exist, apparently?
[38:25.29]No.
[38:25.45]Huh?
[38:26.33]What, you've never seen a guy walk over a table before?
[38:29.89]Please.
[38:30.17]Anyway, now I'm on track.
[38:32.83]Let's go.
[38:37.12]Explosive barrels.
[38:41.78]That guy's all the way down there.
[38:43.62]This place is huge.
[38:45.90]But now I should be able to waltz right in here.
[38:53.30]I'm not gonna get, like, attacked, am I?
[38:54.40]I don't even need to... What am I doing?
[39:00.53]I don't need to climb.
[39:01.31]I can just walk right in.
[39:05.69]I'm one of them.
[39:07.19]Hello, drooper.
[39:11.36]Why do people get so scared of that?
[39:12.64]Did you see that?
[39:14.70]I don't have a keycard.
[39:19.80]Shit.
[39:21.58]Can I go through, like, the turnstile?
[39:24.21]Didn't have a key card.
[39:24.99]Just listening.
[39:25.71]Good intel.
[39:26.09]Alright, this is where I need to be.
[39:27.39]Who is looking at me right now?
[39:56.76]That lady can see through my disguise?
[39:59.00]Yeah, I'm not suspicious.
[40:04.65]Ooh.
[40:04.73]What is that?
[40:05.05]Give me that.
[40:05.31]Whatever it is.
[40:05.71]Give me that tablet.
[40:06.91]Just stand here this long.
[40:25.52]I pressed a fucking button.
[40:26.68]Go in the break room.
[40:40.14]Where's this going?
[40:42.70]I don't know.
[40:44.98]Can I sit down?
[40:47.12]How do I blend in?
[40:47.64]How do I blend in?
[40:48.71]Where's the blend in button?
[40:50.15]I can't even look at the intel.
[40:55.17]I gotta go that way.
[40:56.57]This is the masseuse.
[41:02.88]You can't keep me in here under these circumstances.
[41:07.42]Massage expert... Okay, the masseur... The masseuse... The masseur is on the phone in the conference room pleading with his boss to get him out of his appointment with Klaus Strandberg.
[41:16.29]They probably don't share the same ethical guidelines.
[41:18.33]I had known.
[41:20.13]Well, that's easy for you to say.
[41:22.36]You're not the one supposed to be doing deep tissue massage in a freaking war zone, okay?
[41:29.48]It is that bad, Donald, it is.
[41:31.58]Believe me.
[41:33.36]Did you just... Did you see that?
[41:34.22]No, do not put me on hold...
[41:36.23]He just said... He said, don't tell me, Donald.
[41:38.91]Believe me.
[41:40.89]This came out like fucking a year ago, didn't it?
[41:46.33]Holy shit.
[41:48.24]Yes, I'm still here.
[41:50.40]And I'm still not doing it.
[41:52.94]Forget about the angry mob, okay?
[41:54.88]Do you know who this... How do I get rid of this guy?
[41:57.28]Huh, Donald?
[41:57.90]Do you?
[41:58.78]He's a wanted fugitive.
[42:00.53]He's like the Prince of Fiscal Darkness.
[42:03.99]I'm not performing...
[42:07.00]Well, you know, we could throw a coin.
[42:10.20]That guy's not even paying attention.
[42:13.14]Believe me.
[42:16.84]Okay, we're going to save here.
[42:20.74]We're going to see what happens.
[42:23.84]This guy's on his cell phone.
[42:25.12]We're not paying any attention.
[42:26.83]Let's just see what happens if we shoot this guy.
[42:31.59]Okay.
[42:33.71]So he stops playing Angry Birds and looks up at you.
[42:36.65]Got it.
[42:42.61]Explosive breaching charge.
[42:53.06]This is taking so long.
[42:53.80]Come on.
[42:54.18]Alright.
[42:57.62]Can I snuff pills in that guy's throat?
[42:59.26]Huh.
[43:01.20]Huh.
[43:12.47]That's how you do it.
[43:15.61]I will take the massage outfit.
[43:19.28]Stuff this guy in a closet.
[43:23.24]See you later.
[43:26.48]And put his friend in there too.
[43:28.36]We're not killing anybody this time, guys.
[43:29.92]Give me my wrench back.
[43:32.20]I need at least two of them.
[43:35.91]Somebody's coming in here.
[43:39.93]Put it behind and stand up.
[43:42.64]Hey!
[43:43.54]Huh?
[43:44.84]What the?
[43:49.55]Where is he?
[43:51.11]Why?
[43:51.45]No!
[43:53.59]Come on!
[43:54.89]Why is this guy coming in here?
[43:58.05]Why would you come in here?
[44:00.08]Why?
[44:00.40]Would you even walk in here?
[44:03.42]This one fucking dumb AI pathing idiot has to walk in and walk out of this office for no reason.
[44:10.09]The masseuse with the shotgun is probably suspicious.
[44:15.40]Fuck it.
[44:16.38]Quickly.
[44:18.18]Quickly now.
[44:18.62]Get him in there.
[44:37.46]Both of you get in there, and then the one guy that comes in here for Lipton Ice Tea... Sponsored.
[44:42.90]Sponsored stream.
[44:47.70]No, you know what?
[44:48.40]I'm gonna wait for this guy.
[44:51.78]I'm gonna smash this guy in the fucking head with a bat.
[44:54.97]Or a wrench.
[44:55.79]Either one.
[44:56.25]Alright.
[44:56.69]We're good.
[45:01.55]Poisoned coffee glass.
[45:06.49]Poisoning this guy that comes in.
[45:09.45]Who's that?
[45:13.77]Don't mind me.
[45:15.11]I'm just poisoning your coffee.
[45:31.82]Can I close the door on him?
[45:35.59]I swear to God, this guy is fucking up everything.
[45:41.92]I swear to God.
[45:43.74]I'm poisoning the coffee first.
[45:49.50]I swear to God.
[45:50.28]These motherfuckers.
[45:54.50]...as a result, hmm?
[45:55.84]Then what would I do with... ...myself and my life?
[46:00.78]What the...
[46:11.35]No, I got a better idea.
[46:15.77]I have a much better idea.
[46:23.97]Save it.
[46:25.49]Save the fucking game.
[46:26.71]I'm angry right now.
[46:30.46]It's the goddamn shotgun.
[46:32.04]It's the shotgun.
[46:34.96]Okay.
[46:38.96]Don't worry.
[46:46.52]Enjoy your coffee, sir.
[46:47.60]He's not even going to come get his coffee, is he?
[47:02.66]He walks in here.
[47:03.78]What's that?
[47:06.02]What is that right next to my coffee?
[47:20.04]Come drink the coffee.
[47:24.59]Oh, I found a shotgun.
[47:39.52]It just makes like a fucking little puff of smoke.
[47:43.56]It doesn't do anything.
[47:46.18]Hold on.
[47:47.48]Wait a second.
[47:48.74]Wait a second.
[47:54.12]Wait one second.
[47:56.04]This is important.
[47:58.07]This is very important.
[48:00.91]It's a dud.
[48:06.37]This is important.
[48:11.89]This is so important.
[48:13.99]If this guy comes in and takes a sip out of this coffee.
[48:18.15]Come take a sip out of your coffee.
[48:21.09]He's looking at the gun on the ground.
[48:23.30]Oh my god.
[48:24.06]Do I seriously have to get rid of all this fucking shit?
[48:27.30]How annoying.
[48:28.02]I just want to breathe smoke on this guy and have it kill him.
[48:42.08]Hold on.
[48:42.46]Watch out.
[48:42.86]There's a gun on the ground.
[48:47.08]And where's the shotgun?
[48:48.06]I have it on me.
[48:48.52]Okay, we're good.
[48:58.38]Hmm?
[49:00.94]Oh, he's looking at it.
[49:01.76]He's looking at the detonator.
[49:04.78]What?
[49:04.94]You don't want an iPad with your coffee?
[49:06.66]Okay.
[49:12.45]Why would you be that concerned about that?
[49:17.42]Yeah, go take a look at it.
[49:19.06]What?
[49:19.22]What's wrong with the coffee?
[49:21.08]Oh, shit.
[49:22.32]Okay.
[49:22.90]Okay.
[49:25.26]Okay.
[49:50.58]Go look at it.
[49:51.40]What is that on the ground?
[49:52.98]What is that thing?
[49:54.24]Are you serious?
[49:59.33]That one didn't do anything?
[50:03.85]Come on.
[50:06.31]He was so far away from the other one.
[50:08.95]He was so far away.
[50:13.62]I need to get... I just gotta take a sip of his coffee.
[50:23.68]Oh my god, it just poofed on me.
[50:26.16]Now I'm gonna die.
[50:27.26]Okay, let's go with right.
[50:37.83]He's not gonna see that, is he?
[50:41.02]Ah!
[50:43.60]He hasn't seen it yet.
[50:44.40]Take a sip of the coffee.
[50:45.22]Hey, wait a minute.
[50:49.34]God damn it, I just did a magic trick.
[50:50.90]Why did it kill the other guy?
[50:56.18]Police officer die.
[51:00.24]I have to get this in the perfect spot.
[51:07.97]It needs to be right behind the desk.
[51:09.77]He needs to get close enough where he won't see it.
[51:15.61]Like right back there.
[51:19.33]He's going to see that.
[51:26.96]What if he takes the sip and I throw it behind him?
[51:33.96]There we go.
[51:37.44]Hmm.
[51:39.70]What?
[51:40.96]Why?
[51:41.84]No.
[51:46.71]Weird.
[51:47.69]Weird.
[51:48.61]Weird, huh?
[52:04.03]Just poison the coffee.
[52:08.25]No, no.
[52:09.15]This is important.
[52:17.17]This time, there's going to be no reason why it won't blow him up.
[52:19.99]I'm going to blow it the second he walks in the fucking room.
[52:21.77]It's going to be under his feet.
[52:27.11]Here we go.
[52:27.51]One, two, three.
[52:30.57]No way.
[52:39.16]I can't believe it killed that for why did it kill the cop our hypothesis our scientific testing is done that cop was standing like at least four or five feet away I cannot kill this guy with the stupid puff of smoke and it killed one guy the door blocked it now you give me another reason to want to do it again
[53:13.48]Doesn't even hurt me.
[53:15.42]That shit doesn't even hurt me.
[53:16.42]Can it only hurt guys if they're in a police officer outfit?
[53:26.06]Let's try that for a hypothesis.
[53:28.16]Will it only hurt a guy?
[53:34.37]I don't have any explanation for that.
[53:36.13]Unless the glass killed him.
[53:39.61]Most productive streamer?
[53:42.18]No, this is important.
[53:43.10]Like, I need to know this.
[53:48.86]Use the real explosives.
[53:52.32]Uh, I don't have them.
[53:55.32]Actually, yeah, I do.
[53:55.92]Remote explosive.
[53:57.11]But I wanted to see... Whatever, fuck it.
[54:10.27]Will he even see this one?
[54:19.40]Was that an explosion?
[54:21.46]Why would you continue to stand in the room?
[54:26.36]I don't know.
[54:28.31]I'm not sure why you stand in the room still.
[54:55.04]Alright, bring the guy over here.
[55:05.89]God, fuck it.
[55:10.69]Oh, this fucking alarm hurts!
[55:12.33]Yes!
[55:20.50]Alright, we're moving on.
[55:21.46]We did it.
[55:21.90]It's funny.
[55:22.78]It's funny.
[55:23.42]Are you clear?
[55:31.47]My ears.
[55:32.17]I'm sorry.
[55:33.95]Mission failed.
[55:34.57]Thanks, Muffle.
[55:36.37]Mr. Wolfgang Wolf.
[55:38.47]Alright, drop.
[55:39.33]Wait, I gotta get rid of these guns quick.
[55:48.09]This guy's going to see through my disguise.
[55:50.51]But hopefully he won't be in here long enough.
[55:57.24]Shit, I want to do it again so bad.
[56:08.12]What the hell?
[56:10.50]Help!
[56:11.20]Help!
[56:11.70]God damn it!
[56:12.39]Stop doing it!
[56:13.11]Go!
[56:13.73]Go!
[56:14.13]Go!
[56:14.55]Go!
[56:14.85]Get out.
[56:15.25]Just get out of here.
[56:18.17]Just get the fuck out of this room.
[56:22.62]I so badly want to do it again.
[56:25.38]Stop, stop, stop.
[56:38.49]Okay, we're good.
[56:39.33]We can finally move on.
[56:43.86]Don't do that!
[56:44.90]We risked the safety of the whole consulate for some white-collar criminal.
[56:48.54]Hold on.
[56:49.02]Hold on.
[56:49.32]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[56:51.88]We're going piece by piece, inch by inch.
[56:53.64]We don't know that.
[56:54.46]Until there's an actual ruling, we have to give Strandberg the benefit of the doubt.
[56:58.00]He is a Swedish citizen.
[56:59.16]Oh, come on.
[56:59.80]As if anyone doubted he did it.
[57:01.90]Well, maybe Olander has access to information we don't.
[57:04.67]You think of that?
[57:05.65]He's the consul... Whoa.
[57:08.85]Huh?
[57:09.67]Hey.
[57:11.49]That means now, dipshit.
[57:17.57]It worked!
[57:18.89]It worked, yes!
[57:23.11]It worked!
[57:28.13]Now we can finally move on.
[57:29.66]It happened to another person.
[57:32.92]Got him.
[57:41.82]That means now, dipshit.
[57:46.32]Alright, we're fine.
[57:47.78]Poison water, no, we don't need to do that.
[57:49.20]Talk to the secretary.
[57:49.96]Hey, we made it two rooms, guys.
[57:51.06]It's been like 25 minutes.
[57:52.42]Let's go massage this guy.
[58:07.17]What a Dwight.
[58:08.51]He's right there.
[58:29.40]I had to.
[58:30.10]It's insane.
[58:31.08]If you ask me, we risk the safety of the whole console.
[58:34.16]Fucking God, I love this game.
[58:35.98]We don't know that.
[58:40.22]Connie Engstrom, Monsieur.
[58:42.20]Here for an appointment with Klaus Strandberg.
[58:44.26]Ah, Mr. Engstrom.
[58:45.96]Please proceed to the massage room.
[58:47.76]It's upstairs on the right.
[58:49.36]I'll inform Mr. Strandberg.
[58:52.41]Alright, I'm done.
[58:53.83]I promise, I promise I'm done.
[58:55.35]Very funny.
[58:58.65]It is funny.
[58:59.27]Oh, shit.
[58:59.99]Hold on, I've got...
[59:06.88]Anybody in this room?
[59:07.42]Will they find this?
[59:09.10]Or did they just find guns?
[59:10.44]I think it's just guns, right?
[59:38.40]Well, let's find out.
[59:43.74]Hopefully you don't find the remote detonated explosives.
[59:48.04]What the hell are you doing with this?
[59:49.60]What?
[59:49.84]Oh, my God.
[59:51.02]So, what is it?
[59:51.64]Don't you move.
[59:52.68]No, fuck.
[59:52.96]I was going to...
[60:08.35]Okay, so they will find them.
[60:13.99]What, I had another gun?
[60:14.93]It wasn't funny.
[60:27.40]No, I didn't have another gun.
[60:28.54]That's the only gun I had, right?
[60:31.20]No, no, I did have another gun.
[60:32.54]I did.
[60:37.06]I forgot about the guy.
[60:38.14]The gun I picked up from the guy in the corpse.
[60:44.06]Come on.
[60:46.94]Sir, sorry.
[60:47.73]This is just going to take a second.
[60:50.79]Will he find the detonator stuff?
[60:54.29]Why the hell are you carrying this?
[60:56.91]Yeah, he will.
[60:58.03]He will.
[60:59.58]Okay.
[61:01.30]I got to drop it all.
[61:02.18]I thought it was just guns.
[61:07.87]It actually says it on there.
[61:09.65]Learn to read.
[61:10.43]I didn't know it said that.
[61:19.56]Oh, yeah, you talk about like the bathroom symbol.
[61:22.20]I thought that just meant you can't take it into the fucking bathroom.
[61:25.28]Come on, guys.
[61:25.90]Can I drop this, please?
[61:33.72]Drop it.
[61:35.52]Oh, shit.
[61:37.43]Oh, that's not good.
[61:40.73]Oh my fucking god.
[61:42.33]Get rid of it.
[61:44.91]Drop it.
[61:50.51]I'm legit dropping these on the ground and they're gonna blow up if somebody goes near them.
[61:54.92]No.
[62:00.44]How do I safely drop these things without them potentially exploding?
[62:14.66]Like, can I safely put these down somewhere?
[62:19.54]Is it like a box I can put them in?
[62:22.75]How do I get rid of these without having to throw them on the ground?
[62:26.87]Like, drop.
[62:27.65]I just want to drop the whole thing.
[62:28.99]There it is.
[62:33.75]No, I still have it.
[62:34.83]I'm still going to detonate it.
[62:38.34]I can't drop this.
[62:39.02]I have to carry this around.
[62:51.43]Alright, we're good.
[62:52.63]No, we're not good.
[62:57.68]I'm just... This guy's coming over here.
[63:01.00]Alright, we're good.
[63:04.49]Hmm?
[63:06.63]Fuck you guys, seriously.
[63:12.69]We're good.
[63:13.48]Alright, we got no illegal items.
[63:14.58]A wrench is not illegal.
[63:15.38]Oh.
[63:38.31]And you're clear.
[63:39.81]Thank you, sir.
[63:41.26]You're welcome.
[63:41.84]Thank you.
[63:42.32]What the hell?
[63:43.18]Why did you do this, you maniac?
[63:44.10]What the fuck is going on?
[63:44.96]Oh, it's because I... God damn it!
[63:46.66]He searched me and then he shot me.
[63:50.28]What the fuck?
[64:13.14]Okay, I gotta put these somewhere where no one's gonna fucking find them.
[64:16.45]Why did I pick this many?
[64:21.25]I need to find a little corner where no one's gonna walk, and I gotta find one of those buckets where I can dump all my shit.
[64:31.63]Where's one?
[64:33.01]They exist all over the place.
[64:49.75]Alright, we're gonna put them in the trash can.
[64:51.87]Conceal item.
[64:57.28]I can't even... I can't conceal more than one thing in this trash.
[65:01.18]Are you serious?
[65:01.70]Alright, we're gonna just put one in the trash can.
[65:04.68]Gonna put one in the toilet.
[65:08.54]What was that?
[65:19.89]By the time I get upstairs, it won't even fucking matter.
[65:25.19]I am now not illegal.
[65:28.82]Someone's going to find a bunch of random shit in this bathroom.
[65:32.20]And good for you.
[65:33.86]You hit the fucking jackpot.
[65:35.62]Let's go.
[65:45.02]Oh, no.
[65:46.36]I found some shit in the bathroom.
[65:48.22]Feeling relaxed today, sir?
[65:53.02]Someone's gonna have a bad day in that bathroom.
[65:58.88]But by the time I get... If somebody finds all this shit in the bathroom, I don't even care at that point.
[66:02.30]I'll be up here.
[66:02.88]I would have already gotten rid of this guy.
[66:05.92]What?
[66:07.14]Computer?
[66:08.30]I still have poison.
[66:13.19]He's in that room.
[66:13.91]I'm gonna go massage this guy.
[66:17.57]And then I'm gonna stick a wrench up his ass.
[66:24.35]And nobody can see me.
[66:25.53]Okay, let's go.
[66:26.03]No, that's not the right one.
[66:33.32]There we go.
[66:34.58]Alright, I'm here.
[66:35.52]Save it.
[66:40.15]Just got to wrench a bunch of military remote detonators in literally deadly poison.
[66:43.65]Alright, let's see what happens in here.
[66:46.25]Let's get started.
[66:47.17]Why don't you lie down?
[66:48.85]Okay, let's get started.
[66:49.75]Incense is burning.
[67:06.78]Well done, 47.
[67:08.58]I will leave Strandberg in your capable hands.
[67:10.96]Wow.
[67:11.90]Okay.
[67:13.18]You ready for your massage?
[67:19.06]Ah, that's the ticket.
[67:21.51]I tell you, nothing makes you tense like thousands of people wanting to kill you.
[67:37.11]Alright.
[67:38.17]I still didn't kill him.
[67:43.11]He's still alive.
[67:43.73]Easy.
[67:50.11]I win.
[67:53.61]We gotta find some more creative ways to do this.
[68:06.61]Nice fully clothed massage.
[68:12.04]I wanted to smash him over the head.
[68:13.52]Can I poison him?
[68:29.13]Do they really just make it that easy for you?
[68:32.85]Alright, let's just massage him.
[68:34.31]Save it right here.
[68:35.31]Is everyone saying detonate?
[68:36.65]Detonate him.
[68:40.21]Alright, detonate.
[68:57.26]Oh, I killed, I blew up all the shit in the bathroom.
[69:03.80]Oh, what is it now?
[69:05.40]Really?
[69:05.84]I don't have all day.
[69:10.69]Dead Knight.
[69:13.17]Can I just like feed him pills?
[69:17.63]Yeah, it's me.
[69:18.13]I haven't seen anything suspicious yet.
[69:24.12]This is new technique.
[69:27.24]I just dropped coins on you.
[69:32.68]That doesn't affect him?
[69:38.60]No, no.
[69:38.88]I want to, like, throw it on him.
[69:52.54]Well, let's just rub his back.
[69:54.84]That's the ticket.
[69:57.03]I tell you, nothing makes you tense like thousands of people to kill you.
[70:01.59]He's a wishing fountain.
[70:05.69]I just killed a random guy taking a piss.
[70:07.67]People are funny.
[70:09.21]The fact is, if those morons had bothered to learn the first thing about market investments, my scheme would never...
[70:41.05]I gotta do that.
[70:41.65]Okay, we're gonna kill him now, for real.
[70:43.95]No more detonating shit in the bathroom.
[70:46.47]Well done, 47.
[70:48.27]I will leave Strandberg in your capable hands.
[70:53.28]I'm gonna do it instantly.
[70:58.06]Alright, let's do it for real.
[71:00.52]Ah, that's the ticket.
[71:02.96]I tell you, nothing makes you tense like thousands of people wanting to kill you.
[71:14.01]How do I have to move his body?
[71:15.67]Detonate?
[71:18.49]No, I'm not detonating.
[71:21.49]I can't move him.
[71:23.75]He's just going to sit here the whole time.
[71:26.81]Alrighty.
[71:27.99]Sure.
[71:29.79]I can't drag his body anymore.
[71:37.46]Ooh.
[71:41.82]Alright, Zidane.
[71:42.81]He is very far away.
[71:54.00]What was the point of that?
[71:55.04]Where is he?
[71:56.28]He's like extremely far away, I think.
[72:00.59]And... I already did detonate.
[72:03.95]No detonating.
[72:23.19]I can't compromise the mission I've compromised a hundred times.
[72:26.97]No, he's this way.
[72:27.61]Let's get some intel on this dude.
[72:30.65]Opportunities.
[72:33.34]Okay, we can do open sesame.
[72:37.20]Bad blood.
[72:38.70]Or why we fight.
[72:39.48]Let's do bad blood.
[72:41.28]That sounds interesting, right?
[72:42.82]It's very far away.
[72:43.58]We've got to get out of here.
[72:44.44]Can I just break the glass and jump out the window?
[72:51.60]I don't think I'm allowed in here.
[72:53.38]Am I allowed in here?
[72:55.74]Apparently, I am.
[72:56.50]Sir, I'm sorry.
[72:57.56]This area is closed.
[72:58.64]Are you fucking serious?
[72:59.68]Okay, you follow me.
[73:01.28]Why did he not say anything?
[73:02.22]Everything's cool, okay?
[73:04.62]Just move along.
[73:06.01]He had so many opportunities to tell me to leave.
[73:09.67]He just didn't.
[73:13.99]Let's get all our stuff again.
[73:15.45]Where's that bathroom?
[73:17.15]Just stay here.
[73:18.09]I'll check it out.
[73:21.77]Where's the bathroom that I put all my shit in?
[73:28.35]It's not this one, is it?
[73:30.99]No, it's the other bathroom.
[73:32.35]I gotta get all my stuff.
[73:39.39]What bathroom was that shit?
[73:41.29]I don't remember what bathroom it was.
[73:45.51]It's not this one, I don't think.
[73:46.97]No.
[73:48.93]What are these doors down here?
[73:54.72]It was?
[73:55.18]No, it wasn't.
[73:58.66]There was nothing in there.
[74:04.38]No, I blew it all up.
[74:06.38]I reloaded the save.
[74:10.84]Unless did they find it all?
[74:16.35]They must have found it all.
[74:19.49]Because I reloaded the save.
[74:20.73]Wait, what?
[74:30.44]Alright, the masseuse has left the building.
[74:34.00]Got confiscated?
[74:34.78]Well, fuck those guys.
[74:35.94]How dare they.
[74:36.40]How am I gonna kill the next guy?
[74:45.59]If I detonate, I'll know where my stuff is.
[74:47.53]That's actually a really good idea.
[74:50.67]Let's see what room it's in.
[74:53.63]Now you got me real curious.
[75:00.70]Alright.
[75:01.30]Let's see.
[75:01.60]Let's listen to where the... I'm going to save it right here.
[75:04.52]And let's see where the explosion is.
[75:05.82]Alright.
[75:09.88]Where's the explosion?
[75:13.08]In here.
[75:16.60]Oh, shit.
[75:18.70]It was in this... They didn't find this one.
[75:22.77]They didn't find the one in the fucking trash can.
[75:27.77]Alright.
[75:28.19]Get the... Okay.
[75:28.91]I know where... I got to get it out of the trash can.
[75:35.14]Genius.
[75:41.78]Nice.
[75:42.12]Good.
[75:42.94]Alright, let's go get it.
[75:47.18]Thank you very much.
[75:47.76]I will take my explosive back.
[75:50.64]And we are ready to go.
[75:53.50]Why is Mr. Clean blowing up the bathroom?
[75:59.13]That was a great question.
[76:02.19]One that I cannot answer.
[76:11.19]Wait, was that the masseuse?
[76:13.17]Just jumping over a banister?
[76:23.11]If I detonate my bombs, I can find my bombs.
[76:28.40]That's true, yeah.
[76:30.20]That is true.
[76:32.78]I think this is off limits.
[76:33.82]Especially to a guy in a massage outfit.
[76:36.30]But let's just see what happens.
[76:39.29]No?
[76:41.13]No?
[76:41.59]Okay.
[76:49.03]Lots of bikes to mess around with.
[76:51.81]Can't go that way.
[76:52.91]Well, this is the other way to go.
[76:53.92]Printing schedule.
[76:54.54]What does that mean?
[77:09.84]No, I don't want to do this one.
[77:10.98]I want to do bad blood.
[77:11.89]Right next to this one.
[77:12.93]Might as well just figure out how to get rid of these two goons.
[77:17.75]Hmm.
[77:17.87]Scram.
[77:18.23]Screwdriver?
[77:39.55]I need to get a military outfit.
[77:41.47]Let's go find one.
[77:44.87]Create oil leak.
[77:48.84]Will I get attention of these guys?
[77:55.20]Someone's going to be coming over here, right?
[77:59.08]How many coins left?
[77:59.88]I do have six coins.
[78:05.69]There's two guys right here.
[78:08.02]I could potentially get this guy to walk right here, take his shit, and run through.
[78:14.60]Possibly.
[78:15.64]Or this guy.
[78:21.07]Light that shit up.
[78:22.99]No, I can't do any more goofing around.
[78:26.74]This guy is very far away at this point.
[78:34.91]Let's try this.
[78:35.45]I'm going to try to pull this guy in here.
[78:39.06]See if I can get him.
[78:46.98]Alright, here comes one.
[78:51.30]That guy's moving... Is this guy going to get out of the way?
[78:53.72]Of course he's not.
[78:54.64]Hmm...
[79:05.03]Oil leak.
[79:09.27]I can't see anyone goofing around.
[79:10.37]These guys are just standing right fucking here.
[79:18.05]I can't do it here.
[79:18.95]I gotta just find a guy to do this to.
[79:20.86]What about like back around this alley?
[79:24.10]Game's crashing.
[79:24.90]Game crashed.
[79:25.28]Or did it?
[79:33.79]Oh, hold on a second.
[79:34.63]Yeah, it crashed.
[79:37.16]Hitman has stopped working.
[79:40.48]That was dumb.
[79:44.62]Uh, okay.
[79:48.92]The game crashed and it turned off OBS.
[79:51.47]Whoa!
[79:52.11]Loud.
[79:54.61]And now you can't even see the game.
[79:57.75]What the fuck?
[80:03.08]Uh, alright.
[80:08.38]I got like a map error.
[80:10.33]Hold on.
[80:10.73]I don't know, you can't even see Hitman right now.
[80:18.31]Alright.
[80:24.47]Wait, what?
[80:25.98]What's up, my dude?
[80:26.64]Hey, what's going on, dude?
[80:28.20]Yeah, I don't know why OBS now doesn't, yeah, it doesn't even know the game exists anymore, apparently.
[80:39.45]What the hell?
[80:44.33]Well, it looks like I'm going to have to, like, see if I can do this.
[80:46.75]Remove.
[80:49.31]Add game.
[80:51.29]It just, like, broke my whole computer.
[80:56.41]Yeah, I can't even like, hold on.
[80:57.69]I gotta like reload it again.
[80:58.71]What the hell is going on?
[81:05.68]Okay.
[81:10.80]Interesting game.
[81:12.02]You make perfect fucking sense.
[81:25.35]Alright, hold on.
[81:26.15]Give me one second.
[81:28.01]I might have to restart.
[81:30.07]I just did.
[81:30.63]What the hell is it talking about?
[81:34.69]Let's try this again.
[81:37.19]Sorry about this.
[81:37.78]I don't know why this is happening.
[81:40.90]Can we see the game now?
[81:41.62]No.
[81:45.06]What the fuck is going on?
[81:47.52]What?
[81:51.62]Give me a fucking break, Hitman.
[82:01.50]Restart your life.
[82:06.30]I don't know.
[82:07.10]I have no idea.
[82:10.81]I'm going to try to maybe change full screen.
[82:14.25]See if that'll do it.
[82:19.97]Wow.
[82:21.17]Switch to XSplit.
[82:21.87]OBS does this all the time.
[82:25.28]I think I used to use XSplit.
[82:27.18]I'm pretty certain this is going to work.
[82:30.45]Let's see if it works.
[82:31.69]Add game capture.
[82:35.61]Hitman.
[82:37.81]Open the fucking game up.
[82:38.83]Now I'm going to change full screen.
[82:43.88]Did that do it?
[82:47.60]No.
[82:48.54]Full screen.
[82:51.56]Window.
[82:51.94]What the fuck?
[82:57.72]Why is this happening?
[82:59.94]Oh my fucking god.
[83:01.18]Alright.
[83:02.33]Give me like a minute.
[83:02.91]I'm going to have to restart my computer.
[83:05.79]This is fucking stupid.
[83:07.05]I'll be back.
[83:08.41]Sorry.
[83:09.25]I'll be right back.
[83:12.35]What the hell was that?
[83:13.27]That was stupid.
[83:17.07]Give me two seconds.
[83:17.71]I don't even have the chat open.
[83:34.10]I need to do a computer, man.
[83:37.58]You know what happened?
[83:38.20]Here's what happened.
[83:40.94]You know that thing that when Windows... Hold on.
[83:45.98]Let me just get the chat open.
[83:56.76]Alright.
[83:57.24]So when Windows... They like to do this weird thing where they tell you...
[84:03.87]You know, do you want to change to Windows 7 Basic?
[84:09.35]Because it looks like you might be using graphics.
[84:14.27]And you say, yes, please shut the fuck up and never tell me this ever again.
[84:18.13]You know how you do that?
[84:18.71]Oh, I did that.
[84:20.53]I actually went into the Action Center like a month ago and said, please, God, never fucking do this ever again.
[84:26.57]Don't ever tell me this ever again.
[84:29.14]It doesn't matter.
[84:30.79]It still does it.
[84:32.19]I still get that message.
[84:33.75]Hey, you know, you're using graphics right now.
[84:37.20]Should you turn on Windows 7 Basic?
[84:40.98]Don't ever fucking tell me that again.
[84:43.48]Why does that exist?
[84:46.92]Why the fuck does that exist?
[84:50.54]Why do you need to tell me that you're using graphics and your virtual memory is high?
[84:58.48]you aware of are you aware of that master are you aware of that get the out of here I hate that especially when you tell it to stop in three different places okay alright
[85:25.87]And now I gotta... Hold on.
[85:27.07]I'm sorry, guys.
[85:28.95]I was not prepared for that to happen.
[85:30.43]So I'm gonna take a second here.
[85:33.80]I was having fun, too.
[85:41.44]Maybe this is an opportunity to get Windows 10.
[85:47.41]Fucking Windows, man.
[85:50.71]There's so much shit that's built into Windows to make sure that you're not an idiot.
[85:56.50]And it drives me nuts.
[85:59.96]The amount of things that are built into Windows to make sure, like, if you have, like, giant bottle glasses and you've never used a computer in your fucking life, it'll, like, do things for you.
[86:10.75]I wish that you could check a box.
[86:12.61]Like, you open up Windows, right?
[86:13.69]Open up the box.
[86:14.33]Here we go.
[86:15.11]The first time you ever turned your computer on.
[86:16.85]Ever.
[86:17.21]In your whole life.
[86:18.98]Okay, Windows, thank you for installing Windows 7.
[86:21.62]This is the first time you've ever turned on your PC.
[86:23.92]Hey, have you ever fucking in your life used a computer before?
[86:28.71]Yes or no?
[86:30.79]If you say no, keep all this dumb shit.
[86:34.11]Keep it all.
[86:34.91]So Grandma can fucking open her emails and download accidentally like 10 viruses and turn her computer into a botnet.
[86:41.29]Like, that's fine.
[86:41.91]Have that.
[86:42.47]Have that.
[86:43.08]Fine.
[86:44.03]But if you say yes, like, yes, I have.
[86:47.05]And if it says, okay, so yes, how many times have you used a computer in your life?
[86:53.03]I've used a computer at least 10 times.
[86:54.49]Okay.
[86:54.89]Like, experienced, inexperienced, and no experience at all.
[86:59.01]Right?
[87:00.26]If I could check that box to have them never fucking tell me any of the stupid shit I've ever heard in my life.
[87:08.29]I don't want it.
[87:09.11]Don't give it to me.
[87:10.79]I turn off every single... And the thing is, even if you go in and change it, it doesn't go away.
[87:14.33]Okay.
[87:18.80]Alright.
[87:24.66]10 times?
[87:25.16]Oh, my God.
[87:26.94]It was just stupid.
[87:28.62]I don't need Windows to tell me... Like, for instance, when you open up a program on Windows...
[87:34.69]Oh, hold on a minute.
[87:36.51]A pop-up's gonna come up.
[87:38.23]Did you want to open up that program, yes or no?
[87:45.17]Yes.
[87:46.65]Are you sure about that?
[87:47.97]You did double-click the EXE on your desktop.
[87:50.45]Are you sure this isn't a virus that you accidentally opened, Grandma?
[87:55.23]What is that?
[87:56.23]What is this thing?
[87:57.55]Hmm, yes or no?
[87:59.67]No, I don't think I opened up that virus program, I don't think.
[88:04.88]Or did I?
[88:06.25]What's this thing now?
[88:07.59]I can't... I have a crypto lock on my computer.
[88:11.09]I have to call Windows and ask them how to fix it.
[88:14.05]Okay, I'm done.
[88:25.44]I'm moving on from this.
[88:27.30]Let's go back to play Hitman.
[88:29.04]That's only if you run Administrator.
[88:30.45]But still, I don't need this.
[88:32.07]You don't need to tell me these things.
[88:33.43]You don't need to tell me this.
[88:35.77]Like, not you.
[88:36.79]I mean, like, Windows.
[88:37.47]Like, Windows doesn't need to tell me this.
[88:40.95]And then everyone says use Linux.
[88:42.29]And, like, Linux is great.
[88:43.41]Linux is fucking awesome.
[88:45.29]Good thing for Linux.
[88:46.09]It exists.
[88:46.61]I'm glad there's competition.
[88:48.47]But no companies fucking want to support it.
[88:54.69]No companies want to support the damn thing.
[88:56.43]And it's just barely starting that, like, there's some support for it now.
[89:02.02]What a fucking bunch of dog shit.
[89:05.56]I want to make an operating system.
[89:07.04]No, wait, don't.
[89:07.56]I don't.
[89:08.81]Cut.
[89:09.31]Cut.
[89:09.67]Somebody grab the cane and pull me off.
[89:11.15]Let's go.
[89:11.73]Hitman.
[89:13.71]Time for Hitman.
[89:16.35]Let's go.
[89:17.31]Enter to play.
[89:18.43]Hitman.
[89:27.23]You can turn literally everything you're complaining about off.
[89:29.68]That's the thing, Bass.
[89:30.80]I did.
[89:32.19]I did.
[89:33.37]I have disabled all the event trackers, all the action center bullshit.
[89:38.07]They're all disabled.
[89:39.47]But it still fucking happens.
[89:42.99]It still happens.
[89:43.87]There's no boxes checked in my action center on Windows 7.
[89:48.54]And I still get those messages.
[89:52.44]I don't understand.
[89:52.98]I don't get it.
[89:58.92]How do I load game?
[90:04.78]Career?
[90:06.50]Story?
[90:07.68]Contracts?
[90:08.60]Where's like load game?
[90:09.78]There it is.
[90:11.92]Hopefully this doesn't happen again.
[90:20.63]Sticky keys.
[90:21.55]Alright.
[90:26.93]God, I hope that doesn't happen.
[90:27.85]I hope I don't turn the corner and my OBS crashes with the game.
[90:30.89]That's not going to be good.
[90:31.81]I'm not going that way.
[90:35.55]I'm turning around.
[90:36.05]I'm going to go a complete other direction.
[90:43.93]No, we're going this way.
[90:44.97]I'm not even chancing that to happen again.
[90:47.51]No, it was this way.
[90:48.29]Alright, let's let Windows understand that I'm using graphics.
[90:54.21]Hold on.
[90:59.79]Okay, let's go.
[91:00.23]I'm going to save it right here.
[91:03.25]We're going to go for some sneaky tactics here.
[91:09.83]I haven't played Hitman since the Italian mission, like two months ago.
[91:12.09]How are the newer ones?
[91:13.47]Mr. Ekstrom, you are not cleared here, sir.
[91:15.47]I'm not sure.
[91:16.46]Please don't miss.
[91:17.60]I've only played the first, this is the third mission, so.
[91:20.02]It's really fun so far.
[91:24.82]Sir, you cannot enter these premises.
[91:28.14]General Zayden keeps coming down here.
[91:29.89]Over there!
[91:33.09]Pacify this shit!
[91:35.90]There's no door.
[91:36.60]Come on, give me a door.
[91:38.06]Give me a door.
[91:38.84]There's no door.
[91:40.76]There's just a place to go down.
[91:41.76]There's so many military people here.
[91:44.22]I can't go down.
[91:46.94]Go down.
[91:47.32]There's no stairs there.
[91:51.50]There weren't any fucking stairs.
[91:53.77]It crashed because I went over 2 gigs of VRAM.
[92:03.53]Professional security.
[92:09.14]Alright, well, I don't want to go that way again.
[92:10.98]So we're going to go for a tactic.
[92:13.24]Here we go.
[92:13.70]Here comes the tactic.
[92:18.28]Can I get a guy?
[92:20.98]Just one of these guys.
[92:23.44]You know, actually, if I had my gun, I think it would be possible.
[92:26.12]Are you going to come down here?
[92:29.98]Yes, he is.
[92:30.41]Alright.
[92:31.83]I've got to make this good.
[92:32.67]Something's off here in my sector.
[92:34.93]Stand by while I investigate.
[92:37.56]Something's off in my sector.
[92:39.62]Somebody threw a coin.
[92:40.56]Something's off.
[92:45.33]Come on.
[92:45.61]Get, like, in here.
[92:49.71]Just pick up the coin.
[92:50.35]I got it.
[92:50.55]I got it.
[92:51.23]I got it.
[92:54.93]I'm good.
[92:55.39]No.
[92:55.45]He's going to shoot me, isn't he?
[93:06.26]You!
[93:06.74]You can't throw things around!
[93:08.48]Find a garbage can!
[93:09.54]This idiot's gonna see him.
[93:10.74]Why can't one of these guys move around?
[93:12.03]I can't be in a guy, like, regular clothes.
[93:17.81]Jeremy's computer crashed the same time my dog barfed.
[93:24.26]I don't have a screwdriver.
[93:25.28]I need to find, like, a costume and come back.
[93:27.98]This is the only way it's gonna happen.
[93:33.56]I mean... This guy.
[93:36.36]This is the guy.
[93:37.12]This is the guy.
[93:37.62]This is the guy.
[93:38.04]This is the guy.
[93:39.88]Right here.
[93:42.30]Right here.
[93:46.06]Didn't work.
[93:46.42]Didn't fucking work.
[93:53.05]Please finish sorcery tomorrow.
[93:58.29]Oh god.
[94:03.12]Yeah, well, sorcery is tomorrow.
[94:04.78]Let's see if we can get through it.
[94:05.99]But there's no way I'm going to be able to do this.
[94:07.41]I have to find a guy peeing in a bathroom somewhere.
[94:09.47]Nope, this is where I crashed.
[94:10.81]This way.
[94:17.09]Oh, what about over here?
[94:18.01]Can I lure somebody this way?
[94:19.88]This is a perfect place to do it.
[94:21.78]I wonder if this guy will go look at it.
[94:29.46]Did he hear it?
[94:30.20]Yeah, he heard it.
[94:30.66]Okay, I should get it now.
[94:32.39]Aye, aye.
[94:34.04]Oh, fuck.
[94:34.56]He's gonna, like, walk right by me.
[94:44.25]Oh, come on.
[94:47.39]Come on.
[94:47.85]Get out of the way.
[94:49.90]Get... What?
[94:52.00]Oh, my fucking God.
[94:54.66]I fucking hate this game.
[94:56.04]I hate this game.
[94:56.94]No, I love this game.
[95:05.43]Jump over the barricade?
[95:07.95]I want the costume.
[95:23.34]Can I get by?
[95:24.00]Okay.
[95:25.50]Now I'm not going to waste any time.
[95:26.78]I know he'll go over there.
[95:28.08]And then maybe I can just sneak by.
[95:29.26]Hmm.
[95:34.05]There you go.
[95:34.33]Go look at it.
[95:35.37]Go look at it.
[95:35.81]Fuck.
[95:36.05]Okay.
[95:36.89]But I'm not supposed to be here.
[95:43.61]I'm getting a massage outfit.
[96:02.22]I'm gonna have to get one of these guys to come in this room.
[96:04.66]Save it right here.
[96:13.12]Is he coming in?
[96:14.04]He is.
[96:21.23]That was such an odd way to throw that coin.
[96:23.21]Okay...
[96:36.47]Give me a fucking goddamn break.
[96:48.10]That's why, ladies and gentlemen, you always carry two wrenches.
[96:51.50]Always.
[97:02.27]Where can I put this guy?
[97:04.39]I'm gonna hide him in this corner over here.
[97:10.61]Right here.
[97:12.85]Behind the counter.
[97:20.86]Where's the other wrench?
[97:21.46]Did I get it to pick it up?
[97:22.20]No.
[97:22.28]Where's the other wrench?
[97:24.96]Where did it bounce?
[97:28.78]Whatever.
[97:29.68]I don't need the wrench.
[97:31.40]I'm good to go.
[97:31.86]It's alright.
[97:34.02]I've replaced it with a hammer.
[97:40.68]Where is this going to lead?
[97:41.74]Down?
[97:42.14]No.
[97:42.96]I can just walk right through those old guards now, right?
[97:47.13]That's the theory.
[97:47.77]This guy doesn't care.
[97:58.40]Alright.
[98:02.96]Should be good to go.
[98:05.28]I am.
[98:05.92]Thank the Lord.
[98:07.02]Hello.
[98:07.96]Hello.
[98:11.35]Why not kill him, though?
[98:12.23]Because I kill way too many people.
[98:14.89]And I get zero points at the end of the mission.
[98:17.43]General Zayden keeps coming down here to check on the prisoner.
[98:20.95]I hear they were close.
[98:22.31]So, what'd he do?
[98:24.15]Poor bastard.
[98:25.23]Opportunity.
[98:26.11]His brother was one of the policemen who got killed when the mercs attacked Strandberg's prison transport this morning.
[98:31.54]Just a simple wrench is all it takes.
[98:34.68]Tried to blow the lid on the whole operation.
[98:37.54]Ugh.
[98:38.14]According to the soldiers, the condemned prisoner in the cell was a close friend of Zaydan.
[98:43.34]However, when his brother, a Marrakesh police officer, was killed during Strandberg's breakout, the prisoner decided to betray Zaydan and go public.
[98:52.59]Alas, he was caught before he could thwart the treaty at all.
[98:57.98]Not smart, but pretty human.
[99:00.90]I'm just glad I wasn't picked for the firing.
[99:03.12]So that means... According to the soldiers guarding the prison, the prisoner was a close friend of Zayden.
[99:07.41]However, when his brother, a Makarish police officer, was killed this morning, the prisoner decided to betray Zayden and go public.
[99:15.07]So I've got to go be Zayden?
[99:18.21]I've got to go turn into Zayden.
[99:23.38]Sounds... Sounds like a plan.
[99:37.35]Let's try this way.
[99:46.35]Well, that guy can see through my disguise, but it's okay.
[99:48.27]I should just go right behind him.
[99:51.78]Turn on the radio.
[99:52.52]I don't even need to.
[99:53.74]I should just be able to walk right by.
[99:58.60]Yes, I can.
[99:59.86]Alright, let's do it.
[100:03.02]Save it.
[100:06.82]Good work, 47.
[100:08.46]Now to locate General Zaydan.
[100:10.58]So what did he do?
[100:11.68]The prisoner.
[100:12.50]Never you mind.
[100:13.70]General Zaydan says the man's a traitor and that's all there is to it.
[100:17.82]I think he's in here.
[100:21.84]General Zaydan.
[100:25.74]No.
[100:26.86]He's this way.
[100:29.95]Two gigabytes of saves.
[100:32.77]Well, he can see through.
[100:38.47]Is there another entrance?
[100:39.38]Yeah, there is over here.
[100:40.06]Shit.
[100:41.26]I just heard the steam.
[100:43.12]He just got a message sound.
[100:49.44]Go check it.
[101:04.05]Hmmmm. Here we go. Time to get this guy's costume.
[101:07.05]Two gigs of save files.
[101:07.95]Two gigs of save files.
[101:14.95]Aw shit.
[101:15.95]I don't have any keys.
[101:19.95]Ooh lot's of stuff here.
[101:28.95]Got all my explosives back. 5 explosives. Holy shit.
[101:35.56]Anything else in here?
[101:36.24]Any keys?
[101:37.44]Ooh, machine guns.
[101:38.34]I wonder if this guy has a key.
[101:50.17]Do you have a key?
[101:53.29]Key?
[101:55.66]Command!
[101:56.04]Command!
[101:56.56]You there?
[101:57.46]Any doctors around?
[102:00.98]Someone was beat up bad.
[102:07.59]Doesn't have a key.
[102:08.65]Doesn't have a key.
[102:09.25]Hello?
[102:09.37]Oh, he's coming in.
[102:10.71]Vault.
[102:11.51]Vault over the fucking door.
[102:13.71]Oh, come on.
[102:14.41]Come on.
[102:14.71]A fucking brick.
[102:15.32]Save the game.
[102:15.82]I have a brick now.
[102:37.94]The first person- This door's locked too, shit!
[102:43.50]Come on.
[102:46.25]Why is every door here locked?
[102:47.77]Hey.
[102:47.91]Nobody has a key.
[103:07.00]Oh shit, here comes everybody.
[103:08.54]This is not good.
[103:09.78]Brick, brick, brick, brick.
[103:34.23]How many people do I have to do this to before I get into this room?
[103:41.36]I'm in.
[103:41.64]I'm in.
[103:43.62]I got in.
[103:43.84]What do I need in here?
[103:46.64]Hey, you.
[103:46.98]What is this?
[103:59.98]I'm still safe.
[104:00.42]We're okay.
[104:01.90]Too suspicious.
[104:02.80]The game crashed!
[104:03.36]No!
[104:03.98]No!
[104:05.31]We're gone.
[104:05.93]Game's done.
[104:07.33]I crashed.
[104:07.69]Oh my god.
[104:10.85]Can anybody still hear me?
[104:14.09]Wait, I might be able to salvage this.
[104:15.79]Hold on.
[104:19.49]What if I... Hold on.
[104:20.59]What if I just do this?
[104:23.39]I think I might have a solution.
[104:28.13]What?
[104:32.74]Okay, hold on.
[104:36.38]I'm going to try and just like force quit.
[104:39.58]Hitman.
[104:41.90]I can't.
[104:42.16]I don't want to cause it's going to rip me out of here.
[104:43.88]So what if I like just put it on this scene?
[104:46.72]No, it's not going to work.
[104:48.26]I can already see it.
[104:50.08]Oh my God.
[104:50.74]What the fuck?
[104:54.47]Why is this happening now?
[104:59.11]Save it.
[104:59.55]Save it.
[105:06.69]This one mission, this part of the mission, for some reason just keeps crashing me.
[105:13.20]Are you guys seeing it change?
[105:15.20]Cameras?
[105:15.50]Like, is it going to my... Or is it just a black screen?
[105:26.75]Well, I think I might need to buy a new graphics card.
[105:34.51]It's not changing.
[105:35.36]Still frame.
[105:35.88]Shit.
[105:36.12]Shit.
[105:37.63]Well, it's going to go down again.
[105:39.21]The stream is at least.
[105:40.51]What a pain in the ass.
[105:45.85]Let's see if hopefully if I can close.
[105:50.08]If I can just force quit out of Hitman.
[105:51.66]Let's see what happens.
[105:54.26]I wonder.
[105:54.58]Because right now this is open.
[106:01.37]This is open.
[106:03.31]I'm going to just try to end task on Hitman and see what happens.
[106:09.07]So if this goes down again, I will be back again.
[106:14.81]And I'm going to have to turn my graphics down to like zero, apparently.
[106:18.84]So hold tight, guys.
[106:21.06]If I go down, I'll be right back.
[106:36.65]Sorry about this, guys.
[106:39.23]It's really like taking me out of the flow.
[106:40.67]I was just getting into it, too.
[106:45.67]It's unfortunate.
[106:49.19]I updated my graphics drivers, reinstalled some stuff, dropped the graphics of the game.
[106:55.21]I'm running in DirectX 11, so let's hope that fixes it.
[107:03.00]If not, then I'm going to have to change games.
[107:10.36]You got a deal.
[107:12.26]You deal with what you got to deal with.
[107:13.38]And this is what we got to deal with tonight.
[107:14.56]Go with N64 graphics.
[107:25.55]Thank you for being patient.
[107:26.55]Because hopefully this won't happen again.
[107:38.25]And if it does, then Jeremy needs a new fucking computer.
[107:42.73]I've been planning on it for a long time, but just haven't done it yet.
[107:49.95]Just haven't done it.
[107:54.48]Played 640 by 480.
[107:58.86]I wish.
[108:01.62]Let's make sure my graphics didn't actually came through.
[108:03.78]Graphics.
[108:07.15]uh keep vsync on medium texture quality normal two times and no low low level of detail medium it was on high before alright this was on high I believe and these were all on and on like on normal or or medium okay
[108:35.60]Alright.
[108:37.28]Let's try it again.
[108:38.42]We're in sync still, right?
[108:45.41]Hopefully.
[108:47.47]I'm on DirectX 11, not DX12.
[108:49.19]Wait, what?
[108:52.55]Thanks for getting me to play Sorcery.
[108:53.53]It was a total blast.
[108:54.27]Have a sub.
[108:54.79]Well, thanks, man.
[108:56.81]Glad you enjoy it.
[109:00.23]It's a great game.
[109:02.23]Alright, let's hope it doesn't happen again.
[109:03.97]Because if it happens again, then shit.
[109:05.75]I just keep restarting and starting my stream and it's kind of losing people here.
[109:10.15]Alright.
[109:20.80]So what the hell was I just doing?
[109:21.74]I need to get in there.
[109:26.47]Get an officer's disguise.
[109:27.61]Alright.
[109:28.95]The door has to open.
[109:30.99]Maybe I can get him to open the door.
[109:32.75]And then he can crash my game.
[109:36.88]Oh, hi.
[109:38.78]I won't do it again, I promise.
[109:46.86]Now I think I can actually... No, this door is locked too.
[109:55.92]The game still looks good.
[109:57.98]Yeah, it will.
[110:01.08]It's not going to look that great when I get out to big crowds because there will be a lot of, like, aliasing.
[110:07.78]But who cares, right?
[110:09.04]I need to get that guy's disguise.
[110:13.18]Ammo.
[110:16.78]It's this level, too.
[110:17.76]It's just super huge detail.
[110:20.32]I think I can actually sneak out here now.
[110:27.76]This guy's just like, what are you doing?
[110:31.43]I really need to get this guy distracted.
[110:32.75]Yeah.
[110:38.43]There's a guy right here.
[110:40.19]Can I climb in this window?
[110:41.35]No.
[110:41.47]Oh, fuck.
[110:56.62]I didn't know this guy was right here.
[110:58.00]Don't even think about it.
[110:59.52]Can I, like, get the door unlocked at least?
[111:04.14]Every door is barred up.
[111:08.03]Mastermind.
[111:14.26]Drop the hammer.
[111:15.50]I think I'm actually gonna... Nope.
[111:17.23]Uh, having to restart and start this fucking game is fucking me up.
[111:22.61]Bars on doors?
[111:23.37]Lazy devs.
[111:48.35]Technically, I did do as I asked you.
[111:49.97]But where the hell is this key to get in here?
[111:53.87]There's some magic fucking key that I don't have.
[111:55.69]And apparently this guy doesn't have it.
[112:00.45]Apparently.
[112:02.89]Nobody has a key into this room.
[112:13.02]Where's this magic hidden key?
[112:17.13]I don't have a lockpicking set either.
[112:18.81]Shit.
[112:21.29]The key was inside you all along.
[112:25.52]What about over here?
[112:29.78]Any of you dumbasses have a key on you or anything like that?
[112:37.29]What the hell is that?
[112:39.93]Why is there a printing press in here?
[112:48.26]What's that?
[112:49.36]Why do I want to get a key and get in that room anyways?
[112:51.32]Because I need the guy's disguise that's in that room.
[112:59.74]I have a toy tank now.
[113:03.51]Holy shit, the prisoner's right here.
[113:04.59]Okay.
[113:14.55]There he is.
[113:18.54]Can I just talk to him?
[113:21.51]Hit fucking toy tanked.
[113:29.17]Can I like untie him?
[113:32.44]No shit.
[113:36.80]Nice, perfectly placed brick.
[113:39.70]Thank you for the perfect brick.
[113:43.52]How do I get rid of him?
[113:50.04]Is there something I can do to this guy?
[113:51.06]I have a violent offender.
[114:00.47]What if they come in here and beat up this guy?
[114:15.24]Are they gonna come in here and wake all these people up, aren't they?
[114:17.30]Well, I think I'm okay.
[114:19.00]Considering it's just this one guy right here.
[114:20.51]And they won't remember.
[114:23.73]He's still unconscious.
[114:28.67]Come on.
[114:33.09]No.
[114:34.15]I gotta get that guy's disguise.
[114:35.52]I have to get this guy's fucking disguise.
[114:44.23]But all the doors leading into this guy, I have to just go and hit guns blazing because I can't get into his office.
[114:50.31]I need that guy's outfit, but there's no way to get in this room unless I do it.
[114:54.69]Can I go?
[114:55.04]If I go all the way around, maybe.
[114:56.50]I'm just going to pull the fucking fire alarm.
[114:59.30]Who gives a shit?
[115:04.22]Yeah, that'll get you to move, won't it?
[115:10.39]Except that gets everybody to move.
[115:12.57]Gets everyone to move.
[115:21.12]I wonder if I can sneak into that room when the alarm goes off.
[115:29.52]What was that all about?
[115:30.55]What?
[115:33.91]Why?
[115:38.23]They all just knew it was me immediately?
[115:46.17]That was the target?
[115:47.05]Well, like, what?
[115:48.30]Why did they just attack me?
[115:50.92]Oh, shit.
[115:51.58]Somebody pulled a fire alarm.
[115:53.20]Shoot the shit out of somebody that wears our outfit.
[115:56.70]Fuck this.
[115:57.86]I'm done.
[115:59.50]I'll show you how done I am.
[116:05.23]Would you like to see how done I am?
[116:11.62]Who cares about the stupid prisoner?
[116:27.17]Would you like to see how done I am?
[116:30.07]Mmm.
[116:33.57]Mmm.
[116:41.13]What's that guy doing?
[116:43.33]Where did he go?
[116:44.87]He's in here.
[116:49.82]Oh no, a fire alarm.
[116:54.00]Fuck you.
[116:54.46]I did it.
[116:55.22]Get in the hole.
[116:57.56]Get in the hole.
[116:59.04]Go, go, go.
[117:10.75]Save it!
[117:15.80]Fucking done.
[117:16.78]Get me out of here.
[117:17.34]Where's the exit?
[117:20.46]That way.
[117:22.22]Uh, can I escape out a window somewhere?
[117:37.60]Opportunity missed who cares who cares I?

[118:26.70]Please tell me this is after I blew him up.
[118:32.10]I hope this is after I blew up that goddamn... Thank God.

[119:35.32]Come on.
[119:36.64]There's nobody here to open the door now.
[119:40.96]I can't open this with shooting it.
[119:51.17]I'll get the fucking door open.
[120:01.64]I need a key!

[120:57.28]Okay, what if I do this?
[120:58.70]Can I hide in a dumpster?
[121:01.62]I'm blowing this shit open.
[121:05.80]Now I'm going to be ready.
[121:08.02]And I'm going to get that key.
[121:09.96]Something detonated in the proximity.
[121:12.60]Which one of you idiots has the key?
[121:16.71]Is it this guy?
[121:18.27]Or like the five people that are coming behind him?
[121:26.05]Who has the key?
[121:27.27]Key?
[121:28.21]I can't get a clear shot.
[121:35.11]I don't see a key.
[121:39.06]Anybody else see a key?
[121:45.12]That's a brick.
[121:48.96]Oh, no.
[121:54.62]Got him!
[122:02.77]I can't believe there's a key to get out of the fucking mission.
[122:12.22]To leave the mission, I need a key.
[122:15.66]I'm blowing the fucking car up.
[122:21.00]I picked the... Wait, no, no, no, no.
[122:22.60]This is important.
[122:23.28]I need to, like, find the guy with the fucking key.
[122:30.00]What is that?
[122:32.22]I have no idea.
[122:33.12]That's the car I need.
[122:35.73]Key.
[122:36.33]Where's the key?
[122:37.19]That's not a key.
[122:37.79]That's a wrench.
[122:39.21]Cool wrench.
[122:41.93]Key, key, key.
[122:42.57]Someone's got to have a key.
[122:43.61]Key.
[122:43.83]Is that any key?
[122:46.87]Anybody see a key?
[122:47.41]A key!
[123:04.48]There's the key.
[123:05.16]You see it?
[123:05.52]It's tiny.
[123:06.04]It's right there.
[123:13.41]Fuck.
[123:13.83]It's back there.
[123:14.89]I see it.
[123:15.17]Do you see that key?
[123:16.49]It's right there.
[123:18.85]It's right there.
[123:40.03]Get out of here.
[123:40.91]Nothing happened.
[123:41.86]The guy's gone.
[123:44.06]That has to be it right there, right?
[123:48.22]The thing that I'm looking at.
[123:54.90]God damn it.
[123:58.02]God damn it.
[123:59.10]We got a troublemaker here.
[124:01.82]He just killed like 10 people.
[124:02.98]What a troublemaker.
[124:03.98]I got a better idea.
[124:12.34]Watch this one.
[124:13.56]I can't even open that.
[124:14.40]But watch this.
[124:15.00]Ready?
[124:15.16]They're going to be so distracted.
[124:16.42]There's going to be an explosion over here.
[124:20.66]Everyone's going to be so like, what the hell was that?
[124:23.10]Watch this.
[124:23.42]Ready?
[124:24.00]Now's my chance.
[124:24.67]Holy shit, did you hear that explosion?
[124:26.23]Oh my god.
[124:27.43]I'm going to have to shoot my way out of here.
[124:30.43]I really am.
[124:42.53]Just gonna have to be good at video games.
[124:47.13]Time to be good at video games.
[124:49.91]I gotta get one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[124:56.11]Eight people?
[124:56.63]Nine people?
[125:01.15]Can I tactically get over there?
[125:03.28]No, this is idiot.
[125:04.34]No, there's people everywhere.
[125:07.08]Need to get a goddamn fucking key on a random guy to leave the level.
[125:19.57]Time of the 4th of fucking July.
[125:21.88]Oh my god.
[125:23.76]There's a helicopter here now?
[125:48.80]Get me a beer.
[125:50.80]Time to get it done.
[125:51.50]I'm not going to get it done.
[126:00.99]No way.
[126:09.14]There's another exit.
[126:10.04]Well, I'm standing right next to this one.
[126:11.90]And the key is on the ground.
[126:13.08]Now, I wonder.
[126:15.68]This might be...
[126:17.85]It might give me a kill, but it might work.
[126:21.66]It's time for a nerf battle.
[126:24.70]Everyone here is going to see through my disguise.
[126:26.50]Is there like a dead guy on the ground I can fuck with?
[126:29.74]Yeah, sure.
[126:30.08]Everyone's going to see through, but is it enough to go get the key on the ground?
[126:36.96]It might be enough to get the key.
[126:44.62]Key.
[126:45.14]That wasn't a key.
[126:46.98]There's no key.
[126:47.58]Nope.
[126:47.96]This is a toy box.
[126:50.92]That wasn't even a key.
[126:51.77]It was a gun shaped key.
[127:16.53]Did you see the tiny little blip?
[127:17.77]I have no idea what the fuck to do right now.
[127:21.11]There's no key.
[127:31.50]Steve Blum.
[127:32.12]It is Steve Blum.
[127:35.26]You're telling me I can't just blow the fucking door off this thing?
[127:43.12]Get me in this fucking car!
[127:50.19]No.
[127:51.02]No.
[127:51.84]I need to go to the other exit.
[127:55.60]Wherever the fuck that is.
[128:03.19]Guns are the key.
[128:03.95]Uh, where's the other exit?
[128:15.81]It's like, oh my god, I didn't want to even fucking do that.
[128:19.81]Mac system makes me want to die.
[128:23.35]This way.
[128:25.07]So I need to go out this way to the left, like straight that way.
[128:33.07]I gotta get the hell out of here though.
[128:34.51]So I'm gonna load a save where I wasn't killing a hundred people.
[128:42.13]Wait, what?
[128:43.31]He can't just shoot them to win?
[128:44.51]It's almost impossible.
[128:45.99]You die in like two bullets.
[128:47.07]There's no way.
[128:47.53]They just surround you and you just die.
[128:48.55]And there's no key here anyway, so who cares?
[128:51.87]Both targets down.
[128:53.43]Now head towards an exit.
[128:54.61]Head towards an exit.
[128:55.38]Somebody pulled the alarm.
[128:58.32]That's fine.
[128:58.82]Alright, where's the quickest way to get not... I gotta get straight out of here.
[129:03.04]Straight into this little room.
[129:04.82]Straight.
[129:05.86]And then around the corner.
[129:06.78]Alright, yeah.
[129:10.94]Let me look at that one more time.
[129:13.26]Right?
[129:14.18]Gonna bang a right down this hall and run.
[129:15.78]See ya.
[129:32.01]Nice knowing ya.
[129:36.26]Gonna run like 80 meters this way.
[129:41.32]I swear to God, if there is a locked car here, I might shit my pants on camera.
[129:47.96]Thank God.
[129:48.70]Get me the hell out of here.
[129:49.77]My goodness.
[130:11.50]That was, like, so far.
[130:13.02]That was not even that far away.
[130:18.16]The key was in the general.
[130:19.14]The guy who blew up in the office modded me.
[130:22.00]Don't mod him.
[130:26.44]Alright.
[130:26.78]Yay.
[130:29.72]Who cares about the cutscene?
[130:31.36]It's gonna tell you I did it.
[130:32.12]Let's see if I get zero, more than zero points.
[130:38.09]I missed a lot of bits and subs, so I'm going to get through them while we load the next mission.
[130:43.73]I think I'm going to get more than zero points.
[130:49.58]I think.
[130:50.46]I hope.
[130:52.58]Shit!
[130:57.53]Are you kidding me?
[131:04.30]Non-target kill penalty.
[131:06.16]Okay, let's... I killed... It's improving.
[131:11.21]We're improving.
[131:13.51]Considering that 41 people died the last mission, down to 6.
[131:16.47]41 to 6.
[131:18.85]We're making progress.
[131:21.57]We are making progress.
[131:36.33]That's really impressive, considering that more than 40 people died last time.
[131:44.25]But thank you, Aaron, for the 500.
[131:45.56]Thank you, Dem Turkeys.

[133:53.21]We're still going.
[133:55.34]Felix, Felix0 didn't say me feels Batman.
[133:57.58]Well, hi.
[134:00.42]New emotes are going to be here in the middle of the month.
[134:03.08]I had to wait till I got paid so I could hire somebody to do it.
[134:07.84]Mission.
[134:08.48]The next mission is Club 27.
[134:09.42]Let's hope this one doesn't break.
[134:14.23]Why no Dishonored 2?
[134:16.11]I actually plan on playing it, but currently into Hitman right now.
[134:19.11]I want to at least get through all the Hitman missions.
[134:23.59]I'm doing good, Diabeetles.
[134:24.71]Thanks.
[134:25.01]How about you?
[134:25.55]Let's start the next mission.
[134:31.04]Club 27.
[134:34.09]Good morning, 47.
[134:35.79]Your destination is the Himapan Luxury Hotel Resort on the Chao Phraya River just outside Bangkok.
[134:42.31]Your main target is Jordan Cross.
[134:44.77]That is the middle of the month.
[134:46.15]15th.
[134:47.05]A renowned indie rock out who recorded their highly anticipated sophomore album.
[134:51.84]But this millennial poster boy harbors a dark secret.
[134:55.10]Star play today, that's why.
[134:56.28]Nope.
[134:56.44]Promising young actress Hannah Highmore fell to her death from Cross's penthouse loft in Dumbo, New York.
[135:02.96]According to the police,
[135:04.13]Miss Highmore's death was a tragic accident, but her parents remain unconvinced.
[135:09.25]They firmly believe that Cross murdered Hannah and only escaped... Sombra!
[135:13.69]Sombra!
[135:14.14]Did you see that Sombra play the game?
[135:18.60]I'm going to kill both this guy, the head chef and the lead singer of a band or something.
[135:28.45]Okay, this time... This time we're taking a lockpick.
[135:33.72]Just in case.
[135:36.84]And a knife.
[135:40.29]Casual Friday.
[135:44.73]Not going to have something like that happen again.
[135:49.93]Alright.
[135:50.55]Eliminate Jordan Cross and Ken Morgan.
[135:55.21]Let's go.
[135:56.65]Club 27.
[136:07.36]need no lockpicks considering the last mission made me want to pull my face off I actually have played sombra welcome to Bangkok 47. Ken Morgan has booked the queen suite but has yet to check in you will find him in and around the restaurant oddly enough Jordan cross seems completely unaware of his presence he is a singer cross and the class have set up a recording studio in the emperor's suite on the third floor
[136:33.50]Has a problem where he kills too many non-targets.
[136:39.44]Carries a knife.
[136:44.16]Is this going to be the first... Is this going to be the first playthrough that anybody on this site watches that the streamer gets zero points through all the missions?
[136:53.79]That might actually happen.
[137:00.62]Alright, let's see what we got here.
[137:04.21]This is cool.
[137:09.19]Boats.
[137:09.73]What's that?
[137:10.85]It's a very pretty level.
[137:13.71]Hey.
[137:24.76]No.
[137:25.22]I'm not doing that right now.
[137:32.65]Kind of need one of their costumes, don't I?
[137:34.05]There's one, there's two.
[137:38.13]That guy's just kind of hanging out around here.
[137:41.89]Could I technically... I'm just going to save it.
[137:46.58]Because I don't feel like restarting the mission again.
[137:55.87]That guy might be a very easy kill.
[138:00.69]I'm just gonna put on a fireman's outfit and nobody will know.
[138:08.22]He's just hanging out in the lobby.
[138:13.22]That is Ken the Brick Morgan.
[138:16.65]Lawyer and corporate fixer.
[138:18.49]This would be so easy.
[138:27.59]This would be so easy.
[138:29.45]If I could hide and shoot him in the face.
[138:34.72]Maybe he'll go look out at, like, the dock.
[138:38.14]Brick?
[138:38.52]Where was a brick?
[138:38.98]Are you serious?
[138:40.72]There's no brick.
[138:46.52]Place missing note.
[138:48.90]Just kind of taking in the scenery as we go for the time being.
[138:53.64]Beer.
[139:01.78]Wait, I recognize you.
[139:03.60]You're Ken Morgan.
[139:05.48]Yeah, yeah.
[139:06.54]They call you the Brick, right?
[139:09.75]He's the Brick.
[139:11.59]He's the Brick.
[139:12.49]I get it.
[139:14.73]Your strategy was the brassiest thing I've ever seen.
[139:18.27]The girl burned a homeless man alive and framed her cheerleading rival.
[139:22.66]We're going to get a good score here.
[139:25.98]We're going to take an opportunity.
[139:28.64]Are we friends?
[139:30.42]Bugman.
[139:31.37]Intervention.
[139:31.91]It's my party.
[139:33.33]The smoking gun.
[139:35.95]We're going to do it on the house.
[139:37.87]I'm going to give him some wine.
[139:39.93]He's not in the room yet.
[139:42.51]I've got some time.
[139:53.44]I'm not going to be allowed in here.
[139:55.54]Go down that way.
[139:56.30]Can I get through here?
[139:56.94]Are they going to be like, get out of here, stupid.
[139:59.73]Hey, buddy.
[140:00.27]I'll have to stop you there.
[140:02.43]Sir, I'm sorry.
[140:04.17]Hey.
[140:09.71]I'm getting help.
[140:10.49]You can't stop me.
[140:11.43]What do I know?
[140:12.31]A bug's a bug.
[140:13.57]Some kind of invading Chinese.
[140:16.19]What can I say that's clever?
[140:18.45]You're trespassing at me.
[140:19.63]Okay.
[140:21.57]I'll go check it out.
[140:23.48]Oh, what can I say?
[140:24.24]That's clever.
[140:24.78]Uh... Hey, you're trespassing!
[140:27.02]Fuck!
[140:28.24]I'm gonna get zero points!
[140:30.54]Fuck!
[140:54.59]Got a costume
[141:21.81]Minus 15,000?
[141:22.97]Okay, that's fine.
[141:24.45]That's okay.
[141:25.79]Are you quite sure that it's safe keeping these pesticides so close to the ventilation fan?
[141:30.27]Whoa, whoa, relax, chief.
[141:32.03]I got it covered, okay?
[141:33.77]Besides, even at very large doses, this compound, it's not lethal for humans.
[141:41.50]I mean, okay, yeah, sure, it'd knock you out for a bit.
[141:45.82]Yeah, it'd give you a headache probably, but I mean, that's about it.
[141:50.34]Still,
[141:51.51]Okay.
[141:54.65]So, what do I have to do with that?
[141:58.17]Can I, like, fill a vial or something?
[141:59.81]Turn off fumigation.
[142:00.69]What does that do?
[142:26.30]This is apparently part of that.
[142:27.46]I need the bug costume.
[142:30.22]Goddamn.
[142:31.40]This guy needs to get the fuck out of here.
[142:43.83]Why is this random, like, bellboy just hanging out here?
[142:46.51]Will you get out of here?
[142:47.17]This guy's already, like, making his way.
[142:52.98]He's, like, making his way into the room right now.
[143:08.63]So he just comes and turns it off again.
[143:10.29]I need his outfit, don't I?
[143:13.81]Fuck it, whatever.
[143:14.37]He turns it off.
[143:20.38]Does he just come over and turn them all off?
[143:26.36]I think that's like fumigating somebody's room.
[143:29.54]Let's go down then.
[143:31.12]Apparently I gotta go down this way.
[143:36.75]Is there a stairwell?
[143:39.11]I think there is.
[143:40.11]Okay.
[143:57.19]View the opportunity.
[143:58.73]According to the hotel manager's memo, drunken members of Jordan Cross' sound crew broke into the Queen Suite last night and trashed the place.
[144:07.58]Housekeeping is fast at work, which is why Ken Morgan and his bodyguard are not yet settled in.
[144:13.65]Member of staff, that's me.
[144:15.67]Alright.
[144:15.89]So... I'm a member of the staff now.
[144:17.47]Let's go escort him to the suite.
[144:18.59]Look, I get to skip something.
[144:19.53]I get to skip that entire thing.
[144:48.33]What the fuck is this guy doing?
[144:51.55]Is it the guy that I knocked out and took his clothes?
[144:56.47]That, yeah, that's the guy.
[144:57.59]I'm gonna save this.
[145:10.88]What the hell happened?
[145:11.90]Why am I naked?
[145:13.04]I gotta get up and put clothes on.
[145:17.39]Mr. Morgan, I would love to take you up to your room.
[145:19.67]Mr. Morgan, sir.
[145:21.07]When can I have my sweet?
[145:22.99]It is ready.
[145:23.45]Please accept my heartfelt apology.
[145:27.50]What?
[145:28.18]What the hell?
[145:32.46]Shit!
[145:59.86]Let's do it right.
[146:00.68]Let's do it right.
[146:01.39]That was a joke.
[146:02.17]I was just kidding.
[146:02.83]I'm not doing it that way.
[146:09.17]Let me just say, I'm sorry.
[146:11.09]I'm going to do it right.
[146:16.75]I just wanted to see what everyone's going to freak out and yell at me.
[146:20.21]I need more towels.
[146:21.29]It actually worked too.
[146:22.15]That's the crazy part.
[146:23.77]Mr. Morgan, sir.
[146:25.62]I can make your life a living courtroom hell.
[146:30.57]Alright, follow me.
[146:33.19]Approach Morgan?
[146:34.39]What?
[146:34.96]Mr. Morgan, sir.
[146:36.78]The Queen Suite really is ready for you now.
[146:39.98]Follow me, please.
[146:41.38]Oh, you brought a map this time.
[146:43.84]That's a dick.
[146:44.94]Very well.
[146:46.16]Lead the way.
[146:48.78]Oh, shit.
[146:49.08]I don't even know where it is.
[146:49.92]It's up there.
[146:52.33]Lead the way.
[146:52.93]Alright.
[146:53.75]Let's go.
[146:54.37]I'm gonna take him into, like, the kitchen and just, like, fucking put his face in, like, a pot.
[146:58.89]Strange, right?
[147:01.35]Is it this way?
[147:01.81]I don't even know where it is.
[147:02.85]He's gonna get suspicious.
[147:10.38]Right this way, sir.
[147:11.40]Where is this room?
[147:14.28]All the way up.
[147:14.74]I have no idea where I'm bringing this dude.
[147:29.49]Apparently this way.
[147:30.29]I escorted him to the penthouse.
[147:32.05]It's another flight up.
[147:33.65]There we are.
[147:34.27]This way.
[147:34.77]He has one bodyguard with him.
[147:58.90]Bring him into the bathroom.
[148:01.60]Let me save it just in case something goes horribly fucking wrong.
[148:09.33]Follow me.
[148:15.65]Right this way to your suite, sir.
[148:16.83]Don't...
[148:30.38]Put your hands up.
[148:31.30]Put your fucking hands in the air.
[148:33.06]Put your hands in the air.
[148:47.91]Stop that right now.
[148:53.76]Right this way, sir.
[148:59.50]Is it up another flight?
[149:01.18]Yeah.
[149:02.12]Keep going.
[149:05.54]AI could not compute.
[149:08.19]Why did this bellboy randomly just turn on the fire alarm?
[149:15.01]Keep coming.
[149:18.69]Hello.
[149:21.01]Escorting JP Morgan up into his room.
[149:23.47]Thank you.
[149:28.17]Here we are.
[149:29.50]This is a nice... Is this a hotel room?
[149:32.32]Hmm.
[149:33.74]Let's take a closer look.
[149:36.16]Inspect the penthouse with Morgan.
[149:39.34]Yeah.
[149:42.97]Why would I inspect this?
[149:45.91]Oh, there's so many weapons in here.
[149:48.47]Gonna have a field day in this room.
[149:53.49]Is that wine?
[149:54.01]I don't have any poison.
[149:57.32]What is that?
[150:00.24]He wants me to clean the room up.
[150:07.96]Did they just call this place sloppy?
[150:13.39]This is like the nicest place I've ever seen.
[150:14.85]Can you play the piano?
[150:24.65]Oh, I'm definitely pushing him in the piano.
[150:29.51]Please tell me I can fucking crush him in the piano.
[150:31.18]This person is seeing through my disguise right now.
[150:33.80]He's leaving?
[150:34.16]Get at him!
[150:34.78]Why are you looking right at me?
[150:51.55]Get back here.
[150:53.15]Come here, come here, come here.
[150:54.13]Where is he going?
[150:55.27]Hey.
[150:56.95]Approach Morgan.
[150:57.81]Currently busy.
[150:58.37]What do you mean he's currently busy?
[151:05.08]He's walking in a straight line.
[151:12.58]Why can I not talk to him?
[151:15.98]You didn't clean it up?
[151:20.27]I'm supposed to... I was... He was watching me clean.
[151:23.65]Oh.
[151:24.17]Alright, quick.
[151:29.41]I gotta get up here and clean before he gets in.
[151:34.07]What did he... He didn't like... What did he not like?
[151:37.27]He stopped, like, right here.
[151:38.95]Quick.
[151:39.66]Clean it up.
[151:49.46]What is he doing?
[151:52.85]Where are you fucking going?
[151:54.29]Oh my god.
[151:57.23]Why is he going down the stairs?
[152:01.33]What a nitpicking little shit.
[152:05.18]It wasn't clean enough for me.
[152:09.56]I was supposed to press G, not Q. I pressed Q.
[152:25.86]Too fast.
[152:28.80]Wait, you don't like how the room is?
[152:32.98]Come on, let's go get up here.
[152:41.65]Follow me, Morgan.
[152:42.57]I want to try to leave his body in the dust.
[152:58.18]Well done, 47.
[152:59.12]Target eliminated.
[153:01.46]It's just muscle memory at this point.
[153:03.05]Okay, I'm gonna go around and clean up the room when he tells me to.
[153:10.71]How was I supposed to know that?
[153:14.37]He was just complaining.
[153:20.01]Come on in.
[153:23.45]Hmm.
[153:24.89]Let's take a closer look.
[153:31.42]Oh, it's too dirty over here.
[153:33.56]I don't like how not clean this floor is.
[153:41.05]Clean it for me, sir.
[153:43.79]Yes, sir.
[153:44.51]Ah, see there?
[153:49.13]A smear.
[153:50.83]Oh, yeah, I see it too.
[153:52.31]Take care of it, please.
[153:54.19]How careless have we.
[153:56.31]So sloppy.
[153:57.43]I wish I could just turn this up and hit him in the face.
[154:06.72]Okay, how long does it take to get rid of a smear?
[154:13.19]I think I got it.
[154:18.97]Alright, I got it.
[154:21.46]What the fuck?
[154:22.64]I was just cleaning!
[154:24.08]I was cleaning!
[154:25.46]Oh my god!
[154:25.84]Fucking die!
[154:39.49]This is what you get for fucking snitching me out.
[154:51.17]What did I even... I'm so irritated right now.
[154:58.95]Hey, you look like you did something wrong.
[155:00.39]Yeah.
[155:02.73]I had to stand there and keep blending in until the lady left, which by that point...
[155:07.59]Fucking Mr. Monopoly would have been like, oh, you didn't clean up the thing in front of me.
[155:11.07]Aye, aye, aye.
[155:20.86]Smile for that extra tip.
[155:22.36]Get up the stairs.
[155:24.72]It's up this way, sir.
[155:31.24]The guards shoot like professional CS:GO players.
[155:33.38]I know, their aim is so good.
[155:34.50]I mean, I'm playing on like normal, right?
[155:38.88]Not doing this shit again.
[155:40.53]Get in here.
[155:42.93]I just so badly want to throw this knife at that lady.
[155:45.71]So she just doesn't have an opportunity to yell at me.
[155:49.17]Make a closer look.
[155:53.20]It's the perfect opportunity right when she walks in the dumb room.
[156:04.81]This takes way too long.
[156:07.61]Cleaning up a smear should not take like 30 goddamn seconds.
[156:10.41]Sorry.
[156:11.93]See there?
[156:12.35]A smear.
[156:13.93]As expected.
[156:16.53]Take care of it, please.
[156:17.75]Okay.
[156:19.55]So sloppy.
[156:22.13]When's the lady going to come in here and look right at my face and say, I don't recognize you.
[156:26.57]Shoot him to death.
[156:31.99]Why did that take two seconds this time?
[156:38.16]Nice bright sun.
[156:41.68]What is he talking about?
[156:45.28]What is he doing?
[156:46.64]Don't test me.
[156:47.40]If he started shooting me, I swear to God.
[156:52.47]Oh no, somebody puked.
[156:55.80]Mm-hmm.
[156:56.60]They will always be masters and servants.
[156:59.50]I dare say this so-called cleaning was rather superficial.
[157:04.36]What did he just say?
[157:05.32]Go on.
[157:06.99]What did he just... That guy just, like, mumbled a bunch of nonsense to himself.
[157:11.19]You know, that is very rude, sir.
[157:24.27]Just go through the door, please.
[157:28.49]Go through the door.
[157:31.09]Please.
[157:35.38]Go.
[157:35.86]Make sure you don't accidentally touch them.
[157:49.08]This guy got him with a soda can.
[157:52.50]Oh shit, hold on.
[158:18.60]believe you did that on purpose yeah yeah I did do that on purpose I turned I fucking turned and did a full wind-up pitching mound throw into his face he's saying hold on a second there sir I feel like you may have done that on purpose
[158:46.14]course I did I baseball pitched it into his face as hard as I could can I take his outfit check out what do you mean check it out huh hey someone is on the ground don't know if they're hurt
[159:25.04]Yeah, somebody came in here and did a bunch of weird shit.
[159:33.52]What did you say to me?
[159:46.66]I can get away with this without anybody seeing.
[159:56.78]I'll be fine.
[159:57.22]Don't worry.
[159:58.88]Zero points?
[159:59.46]No.
[159:59.62]Make a closer look.
[160:03.16]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[160:03.98]Wait a second.
[160:04.32]Wait a second.
[160:05.61]What?
[160:13.09]It's right here.
[160:14.69]Okay, yeah.
[160:21.89]We're fine, don't worry.
[160:35.52]Somebody just saw that, didn't they?
[160:37.48]It's alright.
[160:38.10]Can I sit on the couch?
[160:54.13]Mother shuckers.
[160:58.11]Mother shuckers.
[161:01.65]That looks like she's going to punch me.
[161:07.97]I'm good.
[161:08.23]I can get out of here.
[161:08.79]We're fine.
[161:10.73]I turned on the sound system.
[161:12.89]Nobody cares anymore.
[161:18.56]Ave Maria.
[161:29.85]Here's our item.
[161:34.11]No, I can't do this right now.
[161:40.98]That would be a very bad, big mistake.
[161:53.10]We're safe in here.
[161:53.68]Is that her iPad making that sound?
[162:00.23]Lockdown?
[162:00.75]This alarm's not gonna get turned off, is it?
[162:04.34]Idiot's on the phone, not even looking for me.
[162:08.86]I'm still safe, don't worry.
[162:28.64]Let's take a look at the next opportunity.
[162:32.26]Our friend's electric.
[162:34.54]Let's go for that one.
[162:37.96]Forgot to snap his neck?
[162:38.74]No, he's dead.
[162:42.28]He's dead.
[162:48.41]Right?
[162:49.01]He is dead, right?
[162:51.61]He's dead, yeah.
[162:59.60]Nobody questions the guy with the axe.
[163:02.42]Why would you?
[163:02.88]Yeah, it's okay.
[163:04.04]That does sound good.
[163:04.52]I'll be over here looking at the water.
[163:06.32]Don't want to talk about all the things you were talking about.
[163:27.46]Yeah, he's with that actress again, Jackie Carrington.
[163:30.70]Saw him sneak up to her room earlier.
[163:32.24]Lucky bastard.
[163:33.07]Damn it.
[163:34.17]I was kind of hoping the package had gotten lost.
[163:36.15]I mean, I know Wes Liston is a sucker for all things vintage.
[163:40.05]Throw the act in his face.
[163:41.29]No, we can't keep doing that.
[163:42.69]Says it's the best vocal mic of the 60s.
[163:44.67]And the deadliest.
[163:46.29]An MD2 electrocuted fab... So, producer Wes Liston has ordered a vintage Branson MD2 vocal mic.
[163:53.31]Defective microphone.
[163:54.57]This rare model was removed from the market in the 1960s after causing a number of electric shock fatalities.
[164:01.42]Apparently, a production defect makes the MD2 short circuit at high voltages.
[164:06.46]Cool.
[164:07.08]Sounds promising.
[164:09.02]I suggest you track down the crewman who picked up the microphone.
[164:12.62]According to his colleagues, this Julian is romantically involved with Jackie Carrington, a former sitcom star who stays in room 207.
[164:23.33]A lot of dishes to poison.
[164:24.89]I want to zap his microphone.
[164:26.53]That's exactly what I'm doing.
[164:27.51]I'm just going to go up the stairs.
[164:32.75]Is there a staircase in here that I missed?
[164:38.89]I don't think so.
[164:39.45]I'm just going to go up.
[164:41.19]It's right there.
[164:48.32]Yeah, we're going to zap his mic.
[164:50.82]It's going to be great.
[164:52.16]The PTA is the Parent Teacher Association.
[164:59.23]Got to go up again.
[165:02.03]Up another flight.
[165:03.87]Sounds fun.
[165:09.22]Wait, do I have to go back in the room that I just was in?
[165:23.69]I guess not.
[165:25.87]Uh... I'm in.
[165:27.27]Is anybody in here?
[165:30.21]I don't think so.
[165:33.25]Okay, clock... What the hell is that?
[165:39.12]What?
[165:45.74]Huh.
[165:57.55]No!
[166:03.89]Minus five fucking thousand points.
[166:07.23]Of course, I had to do it, right?
[166:08.85]Give me a break.
[166:15.99]This can't be stopped.
[166:20.63]Where's this magic microphone?
[166:27.02]Require the microphone.
[166:34.60]Recording crew.
[166:40.47]That works.
[166:42.11]That's not a microphone.
[166:45.11]Gotta go all in now.
[166:51.83]I thought this was a microphone.
[166:52.85]This is a big microphone.
[166:54.11]It's a golf club.
[167:03.60]Was it in the room?
[167:04.40]No, it's right there.
[167:10.98]Alright, now I'm a crew member.
[167:14.16]Bring this down to get to the recording studio.
[167:19.20]You got it.
[167:19.56]It's up again.
[167:25.04]Save it.
[167:35.81]I think so.
[167:38.05]Dirty laundry?
[167:38.69]No.
[167:38.81]I don't have a keycard.
[167:42.61]Shit.
[167:46.81]Who has a keycard that I can not kill, but knock out?
[167:52.63]Oh, hello there.
[167:56.61]Is it the axe?
[167:57.11]It's the axe, isn't it?
[168:00.13]Yeah, it's the axe.
[168:00.93]Shit, I can't bring the axe above the fire extinguisher.
[168:04.72]Alright, yep.
[168:05.28]I can bring the fire extinguisher.
[168:06.40]We're good.
[168:11.23]It's right in there.
[168:16.83]Outside!
[168:17.49]No, it's the... Is it the fire extinguisher?
[168:27.08]No, it's not.
[168:32.08]Security wasn't kidding.
[168:33.46]That is one nasty crack.
[168:35.93]Who the hell could have done this?
[168:37.15]Well, whatever it was.
[168:38.91]Excuse me, you really shouldn't be here.
[168:40.93]How am I trespassing?
[168:42.03]I have a fucking recording crew shit on.
[168:45.21]You're gonna die, bastard.
[168:49.62]You.
[168:50.62]Who's gonna pick that up?
[168:52.00]Me?
[168:52.42]I don't think so.
[168:55.36]Weird.
[168:55.58]Somebody's puking.
[168:57.82]I see the bald man right there.
[169:07.64]Why are you shooting that many bullets?
[169:14.79]I need a keycard.
[169:19.55]That guy's not supposed to be over here.
[169:20.85]Are you serious?
[169:22.55]He's not supposed to be here.
[169:23.47]No, I need to reload.
[169:31.36]I can't go through that way.
[169:35.10]How would they even know I'm bald?
[169:35.86]I have a hat on.
[169:41.70]Apparently just can't go through there.
[169:46.35]That's fantastic.
[169:51.61]Can't bring the axe.
[169:52.55]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[169:56.50]Crew, that way.
[170:01.57]Why would I not be allowed to be here?
[170:04.57]I don't understand this at all.
[170:05.55]Does anybody get this?
[170:08.94]That guy just said, that way.
[170:10.24]Am I going to seriously have to throw shit?
[170:22.04]Oh, man.
[170:35.36]Okay, here it is.
[170:36.88]I made it.
[170:43.24]Uh, propane flask.
[170:45.50]I don't know what this is, what it's gonna do, but it's gonna do something, I think.
[170:49.43]No, no, no, the cake looks fantastic, but we're still missing the topper.
[170:53.19]Could you get one of the kitchen staff to bring it up here?
[170:55.93]It's just a pair of numbers, right?
[170:57.15]27?
[170:57.69]Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure you are, but we can't very well do a surprise party without it, now can we?
[171:05.68]What's a birthday cake without numbers on it?
[171:08.64]Up there?
[171:09.18]Anything in here I need?
[171:11.57]Do you know the hotel owner ordered this cake specifically for his son, right?
[171:15.99]His only son.
[171:19.77]That's what I thought.
[171:21.09]I'm not sure I've seen... Whoa!
[171:24.77]Why would you hurt anyone like that?
[171:32.89]Thought I could do something with the cake, and I don't have anything to tamper with it, so I just wanted to make sure I could save it and see what happened.
[171:36.76]I can sneak by that guy.
[171:41.40]I mean, look at such a horrible ding.
[171:43.10]Ding!
[171:44.14]There's a guy right here, too.
[171:45.40]Hey.
[171:45.98]Who the hell are you?
[171:46.64]Am I supposed to get through this?
[171:48.15]Hey, buddy.
[171:48.51]Come on, that's it, man.
[172:04.01]I'm calling security now.
[172:08.31]He's got his stupid fucking birthday hat on.
[172:12.02]You're not cool, man.
[172:13.44]Fucking God.
[172:18.36]Um, sir.
[172:22.58]Huh?
[172:26.18]That was so loud.
[172:27.78]I'm so sorry.
[172:36.17]No, no, no, I need to do this right.
[172:41.24]Get rid of this shit.
[172:48.68]Just drop it.
[172:49.36]Drop it on the dumb ground.
[172:50.38]Why am I... 27?
[173:03.01]This guy's eventually going to turn around and look at me.
[173:11.62]Oh, please.
[173:14.68]All these recording guys.
[173:15.82]Look, I need to go to the recording studio dressed as a recording guy.
[173:18.90]And look out this door.
[173:23.71]There's a guy right here that can see through.
[173:25.91]Right here.
[173:26.27]Okay.
[173:31.22]Who are you, man?
[173:31.72]Like, seriously, why do they put both these guys back to fucking back right here?
[173:35.36]Hey, hold it.
[173:38.34]How you been?
[173:38.85]I think I got away.
[173:44.63]I did.
[173:45.11]What the fuck?
[173:46.29]Who are you?
[173:51.25]Seriously, what are you up to?
[173:53.15]I need to be here as a recording person.
[173:54.95]Wait, what?
[173:57.91]Wait, what?
[173:58.85]What did you do?
[174:01.04]Get me in the dumb recording studio.
[174:02.70]Everyone's gonna see through my disguise, except I'm supposed to be here.
[174:05.30]Ugh.
[174:25.10]How is that a crime?
[174:27.24]No, they can just see through my disguise and there's so many of them in the worst possible spots.
[174:30.56]Oh my god.
[174:30.80]Do I have to get another disguise and not be a crew member?
[174:33.21]Decision is permanent.
[174:51.81]Like, I have to put a... It's like, oh, take this recording costume.
[174:55.45]Except don't do that.
[174:56.61]Don't fucking do that at all.
[174:59.03]Why would you do that?
[174:59.91]If you get a different costume, you're not going to get these random fucking assholes that can see through your disguise because they're also recording people.
[175:05.35]Get out of here.
[175:06.01]I need a new disguise.
[175:06.75]I really do.
[175:21.55]Hold control?
[175:22.07]I don't think that works.
[175:22.73]Let's see.
[175:25.19]Oh, he can definitely see right through me.
[175:31.86]I just did control.
[175:32.96]Watch.
[175:33.18]I'm walking right in front of this guy.
[175:34.48]Control.
[175:34.82]I don't think it works like absolution.
[175:37.75]Yeah, it doesn't work.
[175:49.77]What am I doing anyway?
[175:51.53]I don't give a shit.
[175:52.37]I need a different disguise.
[175:56.78]Any disguises in here?
[176:27.63]I'm going to drop down.
[176:28.61]I'm curious.
[176:32.83]Can I drop down?
[176:34.59]I guess not.
[176:40.12]Climb back up.
[176:41.04]There's one guy right out here.
[176:52.59]Let's see here.
[176:56.13]Coin?
[176:57.07]Can I whip it into that room?
[177:02.13]I gotta get over there.
[177:13.73]I almost just stepped on that guy's head.
[177:16.25]Pool ball?
[177:17.65]Yeah, that works.
[177:19.97]God damn it.
[177:20.53]I wish these guys weren't just shit-faced.
[177:21.97]I have to walk on them.
[177:23.59]These people are minds.
[177:27.55]Son of a gun.
[177:34.14]Come on.
[177:44.41]Um... I thought I could just toss him over and no one would see.
[177:49.29]Except there's a camera on me.
[177:56.42]I need to save it again as well, because... Ah, why does this guy... Why does this fucking guy have to be here?
[178:00.70]Does this dude have to fucking be here?
[178:02.20]Smoking a dumbass cigarette right in front of where another guy can see right through you?
[178:08.28]Damn.
[178:08.42]You throw like... Well, me.
[178:25.50]There's another guy right here.
[178:27.02]Oh, my God.
[178:27.54]What the hell is this for?
[178:28.94]Save it right here.
[178:29.62]I'm in a good spot.
[178:30.22]What does this do?
[178:57.41]Yeah, I pulled a plug out of the wall and apparently everybody is like, I can't believe somebody, did you see that?
[179:04.75]Somebody pulled a plug out of the wall.
[179:08.91]That's so suspicious.
[179:09.82]Somebody unplugged something from an outlet.
[179:15.12]Can't you believe it?
[179:15.90]Okay.
[179:26.37]I got to throw something.
[179:27.15]I'm going to throw the lockpick.
[179:29.58]No, I can't.
[179:31.00]I have to throw the knife.
[179:31.66]Go look at it.
[179:34.94]Absolutely.
[179:43.89]Can someone... He's just standing in front of it.
[179:46.59]I can't let you in.
[179:47.47]I'm a recording studio guy.
[179:48.99]What?
[179:49.13]Sure.
[179:49.23]I need... I need somebody to explain this to me.
[180:08.10]He has to explain this shit to me.
[180:10.49]I'm not allowed to go up there as a recording engineer.
[180:11.97]When he was talking to the other guy?
[180:13.75]Oh, my God.
[180:14.09]Right when I walked up, he was like, hey, whoa.
[180:39.14]You gotta give me at least a little bit of slack for that one.
[180:41.07]That was perfectly timed.
[180:45.10]I'm going right now.
[180:45.86]Right here.
[180:53.61]Okay, I'm in.
[180:54.39]I'm in.
[180:55.85]What do I need to do here?
[180:57.25]How do I blend in?
[180:57.91]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[180:58.53]I gotta put the microphone on, right?
[181:16.24]New microphone.
[181:18.46]Uh, Wes bought a Branson MD2?
[181:23.31]Yep.
[181:24.33]Also known as Old Sparky.
[181:26.95]Almost bankrupted Branson Tech back in the day.
[181:29.55]Yeah, well, why would Wes want to use a mic with a notorious production error?
[181:34.85]Wes is uncompromising.
[181:36.74]Always chasing that perfect sound.
[181:38.84]He once spent six days tweaking the spring re... Excuse me.
[181:43.22]Who are you hiring...
[181:49.60]I thought I was naked for a second.
[181:53.18]Alright.
[181:54.22]New mic.
[181:55.64]Can I just vault out of here?
[181:57.80]Shit.
[181:58.28]Can I vault out of here?
[182:00.07]Why can't I climb out of this?
[182:04.87]Come on.
[182:05.05]Are you fucking kidding me?
[182:14.27]No, I'm gonna be fine.
[182:17.51]Just go blend in.
[182:18.17]Quick, quick, quick, quick.
[182:19.09]Blend in, blend in, blend in, blend in, blend in, blend in.
[182:27.19]Blend in.
[182:28.62]Let me blend in.
[182:31.32]Wait, hold on.
[182:31.76]Turn up the voltage.
[182:37.56]Wait, he's going into the record?
[182:40.33]Explode!
[182:40.69]EXPLODE!
[182:41.09]EXPLODE!
[182:41.45]What?
[182:41.71]I don't- What?
[183:15.11]Wait, what?
[183:17.08]What the hell was that?
[183:19.50]Maybe it's the arrangement.
[183:21.74]I could add some layers of Juno 60.
[183:24.08]Bit of Mellotron, maybe.
[183:27.02]That's your solution for everything, old boy.
[183:29.66]Like, are you serious?
[183:30.72]Why?
[183:31.00]I didn't do it?
[183:36.70]What the fuck was that?
[183:39.80]It said, wait for the music to start.
[183:42.08]But there was no music.
[183:44.71]Let's do it again.
[183:49.53]Wait, wait, wait 2220.
[183:50.31]This one.
[183:55.54]I need I can't I what did I have to wait?
[184:05.04]Fuck I didn't even save it either.
[184:06.80]Pain in the ass.
[184:08.76]You got a problem, sir?
[184:09.82]Shut up.
[184:10.30]You move around like somebody's going to tell me about that performance in Barcelona.
[184:13.78]Oh, yeah, man.
[184:14.64]Oh, that was crazy.
[184:15.68]Alright, so I thought I was going to blow the mic.
[184:19.54]That doesn't make any fucking sense.
[184:23.48]Wes bought a Branson MD2?
[184:25.32]Yep.
[184:26.34]Also known as Old Sparky.
[184:28.96]Almost bankrupted Branson Tech back in the day.
[184:31.63]Yeah, well, why would Wes want to use it?
[184:43.01]Of course it's a- of course it's the guy!
[184:44.49]Of course!
[184:46.01]Of course the fucking guy that has the dumb thing on his head is not the one to go check it out.
[184:51.85]Oh my god, this is so fucking tedious.
[185:02.47]Hey, turn on this thing to distract these guys.
[185:04.55]Except the one guy that isn't the guy that can see you is the one who's going to go over there.
[185:11.85]Stop that.
[185:13.19]Look at that, you.
[185:14.57]Just look at him.
[185:15.33]Look right at his face.
[185:16.61]Oh, yeah, man.
[185:17.45]Oh, that was crazy.
[185:18.81]So all this fighting, Jordan and Heidi, Quentin splitting.
[185:23.57]Oh, my God.
[185:24.59]Fuck off.
[185:26.97]Is that normal?
[185:27.89]Is it normal?
[185:31.62]I so badly want to strangle this fucking guy.
[185:33.33]Change the mic.
[185:33.71]Wait for the recording session to start.
[185:59.84]Mix the perfect tune.
[186:00.57]What?
[186:00.99]What happened?
[186:02.91]Mix the perfect tune?
[186:04.21]Wait, what is going on?
[186:05.75]Should I turn on the voltage?
[186:07.43]What the fuck is happening?
[186:31.07]Mix the perfect tune.
[186:32.37]WASD to move selection.
[186:43.97]Nah, that's shite.
[186:51.45]Meh.
[186:56.37]Alright, let's pump up the volume.
[186:57.92]Thank you.
[186:58.62]Not too shabby.
[187:00.15]That is Jordan Cross, revered and reviled in equal measures.
[187:04.48]Why is it... I'm so confused right now.
[187:12.51]I can't even tell you, like... Mix the perfect tune!
[187:24.48]I don't get it.
[187:25.30]I have to like... Alright, let's mix the perfect tune.
[187:28.48]Okay, take five, I guess.
[187:32.14]I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.
[187:36.24]You gotta mix the perfect tune.
[187:37.84]It's a rhythm minigame?
[187:59.96]Thank you.
[188:00.72]Okay.
[188:01.32]What if I dub the kick and snare and then turn the room light way up?
[188:05.64]Bonham but punchy?
[188:09.10]Let's try it again.
[188:09.78]Wait, what?
[188:22.03]Okay.
[188:22.45]He likes that one.
[188:23.49]He likes that green one.
[188:24.63]One stem down, three more to go.
[188:27.04]What about this one?
[188:28.33]Oh, he likes that one too!
[188:29.41]Oh, wow!
[188:35.99]Good!
[188:36.59]Oh, that's fucking cool!
[188:39.37]Well, he doesn't like that one.
[188:40.47]He doesn't like that one.
[188:41.47]He doesn't like that one either.
[188:43.26]Oh, he loves that one!
[188:44.22]I did it.
[188:44.86]I did the stupid minigame to make him use the microphone.
[188:47.64]It's his body found!
[188:48.88]Do I- I don't have to do this again, do I?
[189:12.98]Where is he?
[189:17.48]What the heck?
[189:20.17]Everyone's clapping he's not here
[189:27.92]Okay.
[189:28.68]There he comes.
[189:29.86]He said it was shit again.
[189:32.12]Body found.
[189:33.16]This is taking far too long.
[190:00.39]Alright, I'm going to save this right here.
[190:03.75]Like here.
[190:05.65]Okay, here we go.
[190:06.63]Turn it up.
[190:07.97]Blow his face off.
[190:11.32]I better get extra points for this one.
[190:16.10]Okay.
[190:16.84]What are we waiting for exactly?
[190:30.15]You have to start singing?
[190:43.84]He's gonna open his mouth and it's gonna explode.
[190:45.38]We got a monitor problem or what?
[190:55.64]Okay, I did it.
[190:57.13]Both targets down.
[190:58.67]Now head towards an exit.
[191:01.54]Hold on a second.
[191:03.95]Hold on.
[191:04.47]Let's have a little fun here.
[191:07.51]Let's have a little bit of fun.
[191:12.77]This is right before he comes in.
[191:13.89]I want to do something.
[191:20.07]Curious.
[191:21.68]Curiosity.
[191:33.10]Hold on.
[191:38.12]I want to see what happens here.
[191:53.79]Oh, god damn it.
[191:54.77]Keep the door open.
[192:00.39]Right when he grabs it.
[192:01.23]Right when he grabs it.
[192:05.37]Don't I have... What was that?
[192:10.29]Jesus.
[192:11.01]That's it.
[192:12.17]I'm getting security.
[192:14.57]Okay, fuck.
[192:15.21]Whatever.
[192:16.23]Let's just finish it.
[192:17.83]Let's finish it.
[192:20.59]I'm gonna pee my pants.
[192:25.26]Ugh.
[192:30.47]Alright, let's go.
[192:31.15]Let's finish it.
[192:31.67]Sorry.
[192:33.59]God damn it.
[192:34.05]Crime noticed.
[192:34.49]So I can just walk out, right?
[192:37.93]Do I have to witness this?
[192:39.35]Because I don't want to be seen by anybody.
[192:57.80]Yeah, I think I can just leave.
[192:59.32]No, that was fun.
[193:00.38]Cool.
[193:00.58]Where's the exit?
[193:05.74]I need to go all the way downstairs, I think.
[193:10.83]Here he goes.
[193:11.57]Huh?
[193:11.85]Huh?
[193:27.47]Body found.
[193:29.75]Okay, good.
[193:31.51]Save it.
[193:35.01]Alright.
[193:40.70]Let's go wait for the dumb birthday boy to get out of the way.
[193:42.72]Just move out of my way.
[193:48.78]I don't want to aggro you.
[193:57.78]Please get out of the way.
[193:58.50]Can I go out this window?
[194:01.19]I don't think so.
[194:01.81]Can I?
[194:02.05]I might be able to.
[194:07.29]Let me see here.
[194:11.17]Yes, I can.
[194:11.77]Um... This way.
[194:20.80]Fucking come on now.
[194:21.96]What?
[194:25.40]I just need a staircase.
[194:26.42]Just get me down the stairs.
[194:27.32]That's all I care about.
[194:28.70]Down the stairs, please.
[194:32.66]Who's even looking at me?
[194:35.00]That guy.
[194:36.01]Okay, cool.
[194:43.31]Here we go.
[194:44.29]Hold free.
[194:47.72]Oh my fucking god, please.
[194:50.84]Just move.
[194:55.92]Is that guy smoking a cigarette inside?
[194:58.60]No, he's touching his chin.
[195:11.39]He just saw me do that.
[195:12.57]Jeez.
[195:12.77]I could just book it.
[195:14.25]There he goes.
[195:27.06]Hi there.
[195:29.66]Let's see if I can sneak through here.
[195:31.15]No, I need a keycard.
[195:33.61]Just keep going.
[195:34.79]Say what?
[195:43.90]This needs a keycard too.
[195:44.90]Well, isn't that just swell?
[195:46.54]At least I got away.
[195:51.00]Everything needs a keycard.
[195:52.50]We need a key again to get out of everywhere.
[195:58.65]Huh?
[195:58.85]I have to, like, go down again.
[196:00.77]But there's this one asshole.
[196:06.83]Whatever.
[196:07.25]Alright, bye-bye.
[196:11.45]Save it again.
[196:11.93]Every door is locked.
[196:20.69]And where is the exit?
[196:23.14]Right there.
[196:26.72]What a beautiful hotel.
[196:27.91]Thank you.
[196:28.33]Thank you for inviting me.
[196:33.55]Just one... Oh, he's bending down.
[196:37.99]He's bending down, that guy.
[196:39.19]Perfect.
[196:40.43]We did it.
[196:41.31]Hooray.
[196:43.27]Should've got a keycard.
[196:45.17]I know.
[196:45.41]Alright, what do you think?
[196:48.24]Zero points?
[196:49.92]I didn't kill very many people.
[196:50.84]I wasn't supposed to.
[196:54.58]Zero points again?
[196:55.14]What do you think?
[196:58.95]Place your bets.
[197:07.25]Can you believe you just hooked a screwdriver at a guy?
[197:12.35]Alright, come on.
[197:13.81]I got achievement for that one.
[197:19.05]Big fat zero.
[197:23.37]I gotta use the bathroom.
[197:25.12]So...
[197:26.62]We'll see.
[197:26.90]I'm going to see what I get for points and then I'm going to go to the bathroom.
[197:30.18]I'll be right back.
[197:33.56]I unlocked something.
[197:36.51]Machete.
[197:41.27]You guys thought I was going to get zero points?
[197:46.59]7,800.
[197:48.21]Zero points.
[197:49.40]He's going to get zero points.
[197:52.12]Look at that.
[197:56.21]Only three accidental kills.
[197:57.61]I gotta pee.
[197:58.21]I'll be right back.
[197:59.17]I'll see you guys in a minute.
[198:12.21]Wait, what?
[200:18.89]Okay, hi.
[200:24.16]That was cool.
[200:29.14]Challenges.
[200:32.43]Discovery, feats, targets.
[200:36.85]Very cool.
[200:41.17]Check.
[200:43.98]I didn't hear you wash your hands.
[200:46.10]I used my mouth.
[200:48.99]You know what I mean?
[200:49.51]I like a clean... Like a dog or a cat.
[200:51.69]I just, like, use my mouth to wash my hands.
[200:56.27]New content.
[200:57.53]Himapan Horror.
[200:58.51]What the hell is that?
[201:01.15]No, that's... Contract search?
[201:06.70]Oh.
[201:09.94]Because, yeah, can't you make a target in the game?
[201:19.32]Interesting.
[201:21.36]Escalation, VIP menace.
[201:23.10]That's a lot of stuff to do.
[201:27.64]What the hell is that guy?
[201:34.63]7800 points is not that much.
[201:35.63]Oh, I'm well aware.
[201:37.27]I'm well aware.
[201:41.15]Alright, let's start this next mission.
[201:42.61]See how long we go in it.
[201:44.73]See if I can beat it or see if I get far enough.
[201:50.34]There was some subs there.
[201:51.16]Let me just say hello to I'm Mr.. Pinky for eight months.

[202:21.38]That's kind of insane.
[202:23.49]And it's insane that people have been sticking around for that long, so thank you.

[202:55.14]Thank you guys for your subs and resubs alike.
[202:58.34]And then thank you to Uber Legend.
[203:01.17]Welcome, dude.
[203:02.67]Thank you very much.
[203:08.11]Let's try Freedom Fighters.
[203:09.31]Here comes the cutscene.
[203:09.97]Good morning, 47.
[203:10.99]We have a lead on the Shadow Client.
[203:12.81]Good morning!
[203:13.93]ICA White Hats have traced the anonymous data received by our clients to one Olivia Hall, brilliant young hacktivist and suspect in a dozen cases of cyber vandalism.
[203:23.63]I was going to say somber again, but don't.
[203:24.73]Using onion rooting with state-of-the-art encryption, Hall went to a lot of trouble to stay untraceable.
[203:29.73]She is good, but we are better.
[203:33.01]Her digital trail has led us to a remote farm in Colorado.
[203:36.71]The satellite footage has revealed what appears to be the training camp for a private militia led by an already registered target, Sean Rose.
[203:45.85]Australian environmental terrorist and explosives expert wanted for a series of public bombings.
[203:52.01]Rose was spotted near the scene of Thomas Cross' kidnapping, which makes him our prime suspect for the Shadow Client.
[203:58.81]Spurred by Eric Soders, the ICA Board of Directors has asked us... To get rid of her.
[204:06.06]Forever.
[204:06.44]47, are you up to the challenge?
[204:09.18]Wow.
[204:15.06]Four people to kill.
[204:16.36]This is gonna be a long one.
[204:24.39]Tactical gear.
[204:33.24]Coin.
[204:33.66]And... Do I take a lockpick?
[204:49.78]I'll give you the explosive.
[204:53.34]These come in handy.
[204:56.39]Let's go.
[204:57.13]Freedom fighters.
[205:02.83]Any disguise, any method should work.
[205:14.97]Welcome to Colorado, 47.
[205:16.33]This one takes place in Colorado.
[205:17.87]The militia has taken up HQ at an old apricot farm and appear to be training for a series of coordinated strikes, ranging from cyber attacks to full-blown guerrilla warfare.
[205:28.75]The Shadow Client appears to unite specialists and radicals from all over the map, mercenaries and terrorists, hackers and spies joined by an unknown common cause.
[205:39.76]This is going to be one that I will fail over and over again.
[205:41.84]See, in seven years when I kill the first guy, probably.
[205:43.76]Probably.
[205:44.02]Okay.
[205:44.12]Aye, aye, aye.
[205:44.52]Right off the bat, nobody here.
[206:16.11]This is gonna be a shit show.
[206:18.03]I can already tell.
[206:21.63]We might have to use force on this one.
[206:24.91]Lockpick.
[206:26.21]Good thing I brought it.
[206:27.97]No, I didn't.
[206:28.43]I brought an explosive.
[206:31.31]That's just fantastic.
[206:32.47]What do we got for opportunities or intel?
[206:35.49]Doomsday watch.
[206:36.71]Tongue tied.
[206:37.52]We'll track this guy first.
[206:38.64]The guy in the plaid.
[206:40.86]He's right here.
[206:44.56]No, no, he's not here, but the first part of his mission is right there.
[206:57.11]Making a lot of noise.
[207:13.51]He's looking right at me.
[207:23.96]Oh my god, I just... Thank god.
[207:25.58]I just got clipped on the edge there.
[207:31.06]3D printed mask.
[207:32.17]Oh yeah, man.
[207:51.46]If we'd seen the militias holding a hostage, someone would have known as the Herald.
[207:54.33]The term does not appear in any ICA archives, but he is no doubt belongs to whatever mysterious organization.
[207:58.43]Okay.
[207:58.55]Find a key to the basement.
[207:59.41]That's so far away.
[208:00.67]Shit.
[208:01.07]Ezra Byrd?
[208:17.15]Go look, it's a coin, go get it.
[208:18.41]Okay.
[208:47.84]3D print.
[208:48.66]Yeah, the guy did a 3D print of his own face.
[208:52.76]Sounds like a real psycho.
[208:55.95]Wait, huh?
[208:57.11]What?
[208:57.75]That's the guy?
[208:58.53]Right here?
[209:03.11]Okay, that just startled the shit out of me.
[209:07.73]Why is this guy not doing anything?
[209:09.51]Alright, well he's right there.
[209:11.07]That was confusing.
[209:22.10]It's 13.
[209:22.42]I'm going to go this way.
[209:30.57]Still got that knife?
[209:32.23]No, of course not.
[209:36.66]Can I just kill this guy?
[209:37.80]Can't I?
[209:38.64]This guy turns around.
[209:40.60]I'm just going to shoot him in the head.
[209:53.90]You're not gonna come this far are you?
[209:56.92]Okay, well there's one down
[210:22.71]Hey, we got a situation here.
[210:24.59]Situation.
[210:26.21]Cargo has vanished.
[210:27.35]There's a situation here.
[210:28.13]You need to get out of the way.
[210:31.56]Yeah, somebody killed our leader.
[210:33.32]GHQ, Gravedigger Actual here.
[210:35.78]Send your traffic over.
[210:37.76]Leather jacket, cargo pants, and combat... Somebody attacked the guy that was running the whole show down here.
[210:44.96]I don't know what he did.
[210:48.10]Nothing here.
[210:52.49]Gotta get in there.
[210:53.19]I'm surprised they just made that as easy as that is.
[210:58.07]I just had to shoot the guy once.
[211:02.75]Lots of... Oh, what is this?
[211:06.39]Missing nitroglycerin.
[211:14.74]Dropping a secret bomb?
[211:17.68]Dressed up as a scarecrow?
[211:18.82]Again, the ability to set people on fire.
[211:23.15]That's weird.
[211:23.59]That's crazy.
[211:24.11]That's not me.
[211:24.99]Thanks, you Crocomire.
[211:26.11]Three hidden bells.
[211:50.80]I feel like there's some pretty insane mods or cheat codes for this.
[211:55.76]I know these guys are going to be upset if I leave.
[211:58.53]That guy over there will, but I can stop blending and just vault over.
[212:03.07]No.
[212:04.73]No.
[212:06.51]No.
[212:13.28]Yeah, that was really odd.
[212:14.12]I'm sorry I did that, but, you know, that was... Hatchet?
[212:17.51]Wrench?
[212:18.77]Why is every... Why are there so many wrenches in this game?
[212:22.75]There's a lot.
[212:23.27]Okay, let's just go, go, go!
[212:34.65]I have to say.
[212:36.09]So what's this I hear about a training accident?
[212:38.48]Anyone trespassing on this property will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
[212:42.64]Use of deadly force has been authorized.
[212:44.68]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[212:47.86]Don't worry about it.
[212:48.98]I'm not going to keep going.
[212:51.92]Who's shooting?
[212:53.88]Oh, that guy.
[212:55.26]It's a training ground.
[212:56.22]Anyway, the guy was lucky.
[212:58.16]He sprained his ankle, that's all.
[213:00.22]He'll be back in a couple.
[213:01.32]So does Rose still supervise...
[213:05.11]This place is so big.
[213:06.53]Uh, Blenden.
[213:08.79]Let me just take a look around.
[213:09.61]I gotta get in that building.
[213:12.24]Not in the haunted house.
[213:15.64]We need a new shovel.
[213:18.24]I know.
[213:18.54]Can I just go in the front door?
[213:22.94]No.
[213:28.42]Can go in the back door.
[213:29.54]These guys... God.
[213:34.29]Damn it.
[213:38.56]Wait a minute.
[213:38.86]I can climb in the window.
[213:49.53]Can I open this?
[213:50.43]This doesn't open.
[213:51.33]No.
[213:53.55]I love how I have to find a key to the basement, but I have to get a key to get into the place to find a key to the basement.
[214:00.25]That's great.
[214:04.06]push wait I just push him in the window won't that not even do anything oh shit I tripped oh my god that was horrible junkie junkie he's talking about his colleague say I was somebody just like fucking tripped in the window I think he's a junkie
[214:35.92]Alright.
[214:39.24]What is this?
[214:41.80]Nitroglycerin.
[214:43.74]Hallucinogen drops.
[214:47.00]Wrench.
[214:47.34]There's so much stuff here.
[214:55.67]So which one?
[214:56.07]Does one of these guys have a key?
[214:59.89]Notes.
[215:02.37]What's with these junkies?
[215:09.75]Find a key to the basement.
[215:13.68]Here?

[215:21.21]Yeah, nice junky outfit.
[215:25.39]Oh, boy, what happened here?
[215:26.81]Where are your clothes?
[215:27.83]Whoa!
[215:28.23]That's the guy!
[215:30.19]That's the guy!
[215:30.71]That's the guy!
[215:31.37]This is the guy!
[215:31.79]What?
[215:32.33]What the fuck?
[215:33.45]Why is he in here?
[215:34.07]Why is he in here?
[215:34.57]I did it!
[215:34.99]I did it, I win!
[215:35.59]I did it!
[215:36.33]Why did he come in here?
[215:38.93]What?
[215:57.74]Can I hide this guy?
[216:02.60]Okay.
[216:04.50]Got a key.
[216:05.70]Wait, what?
[216:07.48]Save the game.
[216:12.81]I don't know.
[216:13.13]I don't know what he's doing in here.
[216:16.61]That's two down.
[216:19.15]Get out the back door.
[216:19.73]I got the key.
[216:20.09]I got the key.
[216:24.42]Alright, got the basement key.
[216:26.96]Hold on, the basement key was to go kill the guy that just walked in the door.
[216:33.38]So I don't even need to do that anymore.
[216:37.89]Um... Yeah, that was the guy.
[216:42.03]I just skipped the whole mission.
[216:46.13]Okay, we're gonna do the audition.
[216:49.61]Time for an audition.
[216:52.68]Nope, nothing here.
[216:58.76]Alright, well that's one way to do it, I guess.
[217:05.55]No, Cod.
[217:10.15]There is another one, there's another one, there's another guy.
[217:19.02]Okay, well, apparently I don't have the right outfit on.
[217:22.50]Even when I switched outfits, apparently it's not the right one.
[217:25.92]It's not the right one.
[217:34.80]So, uh, wearing disguise.
[217:37.22]What's this disguise?
[217:39.08]Explosive specialist.
[217:40.70]No, that's the one I had on already.
[217:42.78]What about the guy that I stuffed in here?
[217:44.34]I can't even open it.
[217:45.66]Maybe the guy that's gonna come in here is a guy that I can, uh, kill.
[217:51.01]Are you some kind of military man that I- Yeah, you are, aren't you?
[217:53.77]Hey, buddy, you're way past where you're allowed.
[217:56.57]Stop right there.
[217:58.95]Hey, man, you need to drop the weapon.
[218:01.57]Right the fuck now.
[218:04.91]Look at that.
[218:13.12]Oh no, look at you.
[218:13.82]You could walk over there.
[218:19.94]Save it again.
[218:26.69]Now I can go over here.
[218:27.75]I didn't select my opportunity.
[218:34.74]Opportunity was this one.
[218:36.95]The audition.
[218:41.23]Now I'm not trespassing.
[218:44.15]Or am I?
[218:45.95]Maybe I still am.
[218:49.69]I thought... That guy was coming to yell at me for trespassing?
[218:54.26]Where are you allowed and not allowed to go?
[218:57.72]Trespassing?
[219:01.70]Wait a minute.
[219:04.93]You're trespassing.
[219:06.05]No, but I'm trespassing coming over to tell you that you're trespassing.
[219:11.29]Crazy, I know.
[219:14.95]I'm not even supposed to be here.
[219:30.00]Got her.
[219:32.26]Who's left?
[219:35.70]She's not dead.
[219:36.96]Where did I hit her?
[219:40.08]Where did I shoot her?
[219:45.75]Trespass- Who is she talking to?
[219:49.47]She didn't even know where she got shot from.
[219:51.03]All she cares about is people trespassing.
[219:56.35]Okay.
[220:06.41]This is my audition.
[220:16.36]God dammit.
[220:20.25]Fuck you.
[220:27.35]You're trespassing!
[220:28.33]I know, it's insane.
[220:34.57]So that's for the other guy.
[220:36.13]If I can get that... Apparently I'm still trespassing.
[220:42.03]There's only one specific person that can walk over at the firing range.
[220:46.27]What is this?
[220:51.44]What the fuck was that?
[220:52.70]Somebody's trespassing over here.
[221:05.85]I'm not gonna miss this time.
[221:08.03]Can I not vault over that?
[221:09.07]Where?
[221:09.21]Where was this guy?! !
[221:33.77]God.
[221:34.15]Alright, I'm not gonna do it that way.
[221:35.87]I'm gonna go do this thing first.
[221:40.77]Fucking trespassing bullshit.
[221:44.13]There's like nine different outfits in this level.
[221:47.92]That are not allowed to be around each other.
[221:50.54]So I have to go get one.
[221:55.04]Watch out, you're trespassing, sir!
[221:57.10]No, I'm not trespassing yet.
[221:58.66]What the?
[221:59.26]You are, though.
[222:00.56]Please forgive me, sir.
[222:10.61]Hey, is that guy trespassing?
[222:20.98]No, no, no, see, here's the difference in our outfits.
[222:25.58]You don't have a mask on.
[222:26.72]I'm not trespassing.
[222:44.69]Why did I do that?
[222:46.53]I thought I was going to drive into those guys.
[223:19.56]Damn it.
[223:20.68]I thought that was gonna work.
[223:26.04]I thought that was gonna drive the forklift like into those guys.
[223:33.30]Alright, well, obviously... Alright, I need to... What do I have for intel right now?
[223:39.59]I'm going to have to do something else.
[223:41.73]I want to do this.
[223:42.41]So I'm going to have to deal with you later.
[223:44.87]Hopefully I'm not trespassing.
[223:46.03]This guy can see through my disguise.
[224:03.66]Stupid.
[224:05.92]So this test that Rose has planned seems kind of cruel, doesn't it?
[224:12.06]I mean, I'm no softie or anything, but it feels excessive.
[224:15.23]She's got it coming.
[224:16.09]Mm-hmm.
[224:17.33]Nobody can... Okay.
[224:22.41]Can I play Graves?
[224:23.07]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[224:24.89]Steal the badge.
[224:27.25]Yeah, sure, I get that.
[224:28.57]But playing on her past, isn't it cold like that?
[224:31.25]I don't know, man.
[224:35.21]She's just right here, too.
[224:35.99]This is like a workplace accident.
[224:36.81]I could blow it up.
[224:37.31]That's true.
[224:37.57]I could do that.
[224:37.93]Let me see here.
[224:38.71]I'm going to wait until she walks away.
[224:40.20]What?
[225:06.88]Wait, what?
[225:11.62]Hold on, wait, hold on a second.
[225:13.80]What just happened?
[225:21.28]Don't press the button.
[225:24.96]Wait a second.
[225:25.60]Hold on.
[225:27.08]I'm just not sure.
[225:27.84]I don't know what just happened.

[227:22.68]Why would you walk over there?
[227:24.17]He looked at it.

[227:57.58]Client is safe.
[228:05.27]Oh, no.
[228:05.69]What do I do?
[228:06.37]I'm getting, like, intel.
[228:12.55]I think I can take her out easily.
[228:24.54]I love how he was like, fuck, I gotta step on this.
[228:30.89]Just waiting for the opportunity.
[228:34.87]Once she's alone in this room... Walk out, walk out the door, walk out the door, walk out the door, walk out the door.
[228:42.74]No, I wanted to bump into her.
[228:43.80]Walk out the door, walk out the door, walk out the door, walk out the door.
[228:45.90]Not you!
[228:46.63]Okay, fuck off, both of you.
[228:49.88]Let's just do what we were gonna do.
[228:54.12]Let's steal a badge.
[229:01.66]Over here.
[229:05.55]More shit.
[229:06.29]What?
[229:13.57]People act like they've never seen a guy do that before.
[229:15.29]And now I'm trespassing.
[229:16.77]No, I'm not.
[229:17.29]I'm not trespassing.
[229:18.55]Just said I was.
[229:22.59]Am I trespassing over in the marijuana greenhouse?
[229:27.71]I don't think so.
[229:29.25]Alright, here we go.
[229:40.81]What do I got to do here?
[229:41.53]There's a guy I need to steal a badge from?
[229:43.56]Like, I have to pickpocket the guy?
[229:54.55]Um, okay.
[230:01.77]How am I going to steal this guy's badge?
[230:04.45]Is there like a rip?
[230:05.61]Can I go in his pocket?
[230:07.71]No.
[230:07.81]These guys don't care that I'm here, but
[230:25.10]I need to get this guy unconscious somehow.
[230:30.18]Do I have any poison?
[230:31.06]No, here he goes.
[230:40.12]I can turn this off, but they're both going to come over here, aren't they?
[230:48.24]That is a question.
[230:49.62]Whoa, scarecrow.
[230:54.77]There he goes.
[230:55.47]I'm just going to tail him for a couple minutes and see what he does.
[230:59.16]Is he going to go in that building?
[231:20.23]Get out of the open.
[231:24.86]Get the scarecrow costume.
[231:27.71]Didn't realize I didn't have an option, did I?
[231:35.35]Couple minutes?
[231:36.11]That'll take forever.
[231:38.47]Sometimes you have to, like, just play Hitman.
[231:41.37]Can't just go on guns blazing every time like I do.
[231:44.95]Well, alright, here we go.
[231:46.61]Does he drink this?
[231:47.33]I don't have any poison, I don't think, though.
[231:49.95]No, I definitely don't have anything.
[231:54.08]Oh yeah, I do.
[231:55.32]Nope.
[231:56.98]It's not gonna drink that.
[232:00.12]Shit.
[232:04.76]Are these the only two guys over here?
[232:07.73]Yes.
[232:09.53]So technically, I could do a 1-2 here.
[232:16.55]Let's give it a try.
[232:23.68]Because there's just these two further away.
[232:27.26]The guy right there walks over here.
[232:28.52]But if I wait until he goes back, then I can take out the two dudes.
[232:33.57]Nobody should know it happened.
[232:37.35]Nobody.
[232:39.91]There we go.
[232:40.55]Here's our opportunity.
[232:41.99]Here is the opportunity.
[232:43.85]Oh, my God.
[232:45.82]Done.
[232:49.64]What's going on?
[232:53.46]Where's this guy's badge?
[232:55.23]No, it's right there.
[232:56.19]Okay.
[232:56.33]Go.
[232:56.45]Am I trespassing here, too?
[232:57.69]Oh, shit in my pants.
[233:25.59]Oh, man.
[233:27.51]Man.
[233:27.89]I'm going to save this one here.
[233:39.19]Easy now.
[233:40.13]Get in.
[233:40.49]Have the key.
[233:41.11]Basement key.
[233:57.25]Good thing I had that basement key.
[234:00.67]Good thing I had that key.
[234:04.19]And now I'm gonna kill this guy.
[234:09.99]He turned around at the perfect opportunity.
[234:12.61]But it's okay.
[234:15.13]Knock him out!
[234:15.61]Alright.
[234:23.86]Give me that.
[234:25.54]I'm gonna dump him somewhere.
[234:29.16]Does anybody even come down here?
[234:30.30]I don't think so.
[234:32.46]What does this guy have to say for himself?
[234:36.95]Alright.
[234:37.51]Use the intercom.
[234:42.27]That wasn't an intercom.
[234:44.34]I just poisoned him and killed him.
[234:45.56]Okay.
[234:47.32]Well.
[234:49.98]Swell.
[234:52.12]I thought that was going to be like, Hey, I'm going to get you out of there.
[234:54.14]I can hold the button down and talk.
[234:55.55]Nope.
[234:58.61]Why can I not get out this way?
[235:09.26]Save it.
[235:19.29]Turn off the server.
[235:22.55]Sure, do it.
[235:32.43]And then we walk out the front door.
[235:35.21]Talk to Penelope.
[235:40.13]You've been recorded on security camera walking in a circle like a psycho.
[235:42.97]Okay, that's fine.
[235:43.41]These are the guys I... I killed them, yeah, I did.
[235:44.71]Alright, come here.
[235:45.23]I need to talk to you.
[235:46.43]I would like to speak with you.
[236:05.21]That guy did a full rotation.
[236:06.47]Alright, call off the search.
[236:09.87]Can I please speak to you, Penelope?
[236:12.34]Be swell.
[236:15.82]I can't talk to her, I guess.
[236:17.96]Come on!
[236:20.92]Come on!
[236:23.72]She's as solid as a rock!
[236:28.33]There we go.
[236:29.99]Penelope Graves.
[236:31.37]We need to talk.
[236:32.41]Your, uh, what is this?
[236:35.75]I'll explain everything to the slurry pit.
[236:38.13]It will be in your best interest to do as I say.
[236:41.55]I understand.
[236:44.56]I'll see you there.
[236:46.00]Alright.
[236:51.10]Just a meter there.
[236:52.30]Why don't we just walk together?
[236:57.74]Am I actually allowed to walk down here now?
[237:08.83]This is kind of dumb.
[237:11.11]Penelope, meet me at the slurry pits, and we will talk about our future.
[237:16.01]Okay, I'll meet you there.
[237:18.83]You know, we could be talking about this shit right now, but no, I'm not gonna do that.
[237:25.78]No.
[237:27.20]I said, meet me at the slurry pits.
[237:30.56]Give me a break.
[237:31.62]I got Gustavo Torres, Mexican secretary of the interior, one of the enemy's top operatives
[237:38.66]Okay, I'll meet you there.
[237:53.64]What the fuck?
[237:55.32]We're gonna just have a conversation when we get in here.
[237:59.28]It's not like we're not being watched or anything like that.
[238:01.14]There's people right here.
[238:04.21]Oh, hey, okay.
[238:05.23]A good thing we walked all the way over here to talk about this.
[238:06.99]Miss Graves, you are being recruited back into Interpol as an insider.
[238:11.29]What?
[238:11.55]I... Who are you, anyway?
[238:16.40]How did you find me?
[238:17.44]That is not important.
[238:19.02]Think about this carefully.
[238:21.04]You could provide us with valuable intel.
[238:23.85]Wait, so I don't have to kill her?
[238:26.23]Oh, God.
[238:26.47]Hold on.
[238:26.79]Save.
[238:26.95]What if something really bad happens here?
[238:27.99]I still have to kill her.
[238:53.01]Okay, look, it's very sweet of you to follow me around on Rose's request, but guess what?
[238:59.57]I'm a big girl.
[239:00.37]I can handle myself for a few minutes, alright?
[239:03.61]Thank you.
[239:06.34]Do I still have to kill her?
[239:08.04]Did I trick her into coming over here?
[239:10.02]Okay.
[239:17.92]Okay.
[239:22.69]I completed the opportunity.
[239:23.91]Oh my god, I'm going to dump her in the pits.
[239:27.51]Are you serious?
[239:28.21]I'm going to dump her in the fucking slurry pits.
[239:31.23]She just got swallowed by the pits.
[239:45.31]Okay, good.
[239:46.59]That's what you do.
[239:47.35]You just have to distract the people.
[239:50.97]I love how that kills her.
[239:56.13]Okay, so how do I do this without him seeing?
[239:58.47]That's the question.
[240:01.22]It just gulps her.
[240:08.82]I got a poison ore.
[240:11.04]No, I think I can just wait.
[240:12.20]He might turn around again.
[240:14.22]Possibly.
[240:14.60]Okay, these two guys.
[240:19.54]He's the only one that matters.
[240:24.11]How far away do these guys go?
[240:26.07]When these guys are gone... Is he going inside?
[240:30.79]Go inside.
[240:45.75]I love how you just throw her in the... Is that blood?
[240:57.77]Is there sharks in there or something?
[241:00.36]I don't understand.
[241:00.78]Alright, what's the last guy?
[241:07.14]Eliminate, eliminate.
[241:11.14]This is the Maya.
[241:14.08]That's the last one.
[241:16.39]Last opportunity I have are... I believe Point Man.
[241:22.31]Training accident.
[241:22.97]Yeah.
[241:23.21]Okay.
[241:23.49]Let's go over there.
[241:24.09]Oh, that was... Okay.
[241:24.85]I'm out of your league.
[241:26.45]Get the Point Man disguise.
[241:27.97]Sounds peachy.
[241:51.35]That's the Hobgoblin soup from Sorcery 4.
[241:53.75]Kills you in one taste.
[242:02.64]This is a pretty clean run so far.
[242:04.82]Nothing too terrible has happened.
[242:11.62]Point man's right here.
[242:12.46]How many people are in here?
[242:14.88]Just one, two, this guy?
[242:15.98]Okay.
[242:25.02]Sitting down on the couch.
[242:26.32]What is this?
[242:27.72]Apricot.
[242:34.84]He's going to go to sleep, isn't he?
[242:36.86]Which one of these guys goes to bed?
[242:38.02]That's the question.
[242:42.68]Somebody's going to get a fruit in their face.
[242:44.96]What about what's in here?
[242:50.79]Here we go.
[242:57.38]I will fill the sink.
[243:04.38]How would they know that was happening?
[243:07.26]You go investigate that.
[243:08.20]Go to sleep.
[243:26.43]He's going to come back here.
[243:27.23]He's going to get apricotted.
[243:31.26]What else is in here?
[243:32.18]Poison water bottle?
[243:33.42]I could do that.
[243:34.26]Is that his water bottle?
[243:37.30]Shit, it is his water bottle.
[243:42.96]Damn it.
[243:48.85]I can't even apricot this guy.
[243:49.77]I won't even hit him.
[243:52.65]I have the poison now.
[243:53.75]I'll just wait.
[243:54.17]I'll do that.
[243:55.29]We'll rat poison him.
[243:57.24]We're going to have to go through a whole other cycle.
[244:01.78]He'll go sit down.
[244:02.42]I can do it.
[244:05.00]Hey, good game, stupid.
[244:07.79]You're about to choke.
[244:13.45]He's going to sit down.
[244:14.51]He'll get back up.
[244:16.83]I just hope he does not use the bathroom.
[244:19.80]Because then I'm going to have to shoot him.
[244:27.76]This is gonna take too long.
[244:32.42]This is gonna take too long.
[244:45.55]That's gonna take way too long.
[244:46.51]Look, he's just sleeping on the couch.
[244:48.49]There's a naked guy on the couch.
[244:52.03]Same exact thing.
[244:54.27]Like, what's the difference?
[244:57.05]There's no difference.
[245:04.91]He had a couple of drinks and he got naked and fell asleep on the couch.
[245:09.86]Good to go.
[245:13.48]Well, non-target killed.
[245:14.34]He was going to die anyways.
[245:17.54]The guy was going to drink rat poison.
[245:22.29]Either way, it's minus 5,000.
[245:23.37]Either way.
[245:23.83]He wants me to go feed him.
[245:36.36]Well, let's have another talk.
[245:37.60]Am I gonna throw her in, like, the Star Wars mud pits?
[245:40.34]Training briefing.
[246:00.47]Rat poison is non-lethal in this game?
[246:02.25]How is that a possibility?
[246:04.75]You poison them with rat poison.
[246:07.08]Doesn't that kill people?
[246:12.98]I can't save it.
[246:18.22]Training briefing.
[246:20.10]Look at all that stuff.
[246:23.96]This is going to be boring.
[246:25.00]I don't want to watch a video right now.
[246:32.07]If she comes in and does it, I might throw a wrench at her.
[246:36.07]Whoa.
[246:37.51]Oh, even better.
[246:38.12]Okay.
[246:52.94]I wasn't really listening there.

[248:21.36]Take part in the training routine.
[248:26.50]Did you somehow lose your weapon?

[248:37.44]Take part in the training exercise?
[248:40.64]Where is she going?
[248:44.48]Are you guys seriously still looking at the fucking gun that I had on the ground or something?
[248:49.21]They are.
[248:50.85]Give me a break.
[248:51.79]Get into position.
[248:55.43]They're mad that I left a gun.

[249:30.36]They made it so easy, I had to.
[249:36.75]Eliminate the target.
[249:39.88]I did.
[249:40.30]I'm just doing what you told me to do.
[249:43.50]Oh, fuck me.
[249:44.46]Why?
[249:44.64]Ugh.
[249:44.76]It was a mistake.
[249:46.08]It was just a mistake.
[249:47.72]It was a mistake.
[249:48.53]What a terrible soldier.
[249:49.91]I couldn't tell him apart.
[249:51.27]I'm sorry.
[250:10.08]I was shooting some things and all of a sudden the rage of war took over my body.
[250:16.06]I thought she was a dummy.
[250:18.06]I freaked the fuck out.
[250:22.73]Don't pick up a weapon, otherwise they're going to say, hey, who did that?
[250:25.91]Who threw that weapon on the ground?
[250:28.71]Pick up that weapon, soldier.
[250:29.95]Okay, let's take part in the exercise.

[251:31.38]What are you up to, mate?
[251:33.62]What's going on here?
[251:35.95]There will be no warning.

[251:53.98]You disable the safe.
[251:54.86]I get it.
[251:55.86]I get it.
[251:56.51]I understand.
[251:57.79]Now I get it.
[251:59.45]Disable the safety thing.
[252:00.53]I get it.
[252:00.93]Don't worry.
[252:11.58]So what happens if I... Can I turn this off now?
[252:19.05]So let me get this straight.
[252:20.17]It's going to be one of those situations where... In the documents.
[252:26.85]Okay.
[252:31.04]Take part in the training.
[252:32.18]Alright.
[252:32.74]Extract.
[252:42.15]Alright, did it.
[252:44.27]Let's take five.
[252:44.83]Disable the safety system.
[252:47.11]So then it's going to happen... I understand.
[252:48.72]Are they going to see me do it?
[252:51.60]I don't like the looks of you.
[252:53.30]Can you believe this guy?
[253:13.37]You were so dead and you don't even know it.
[253:15.59]What are you talking about?
[253:16.95]Listen to the debriefing.
[253:21.32]What the fuck?
[253:21.88]Pacify the shit!
[253:51.81]How am I going to get away with this?
[253:53.45]I can't disable this shit.
[253:54.35]They're going to see me do it.
[253:55.94]Okay, let me get this straight.
[253:56.90]So I have to disable this shit, but yet they all see me do it.
[253:59.54]Nobody saw me do it that time, apparently.
[254:01.08]Okay, here we go.
[254:04.92]I got it.
[254:25.30]Get the document.
[254:29.18]Safety's off on that thing.
[254:33.79]Got it.
[254:34.23]Got the documents.
[254:36.49]We did it.
[254:37.37]Congratulations, team.
[254:38.31]You did a great job.
[254:40.37]Nice.
[254:40.81]Alright.
[254:41.03]Good work.
[254:43.03]Let's take five.
[254:47.72]Get in position.
[254:48.58]There she is.
[254:51.32]Great work.
[254:51.86]Good work.
[254:52.90]Excellent work, everybody.
[254:56.52]Parvati won't know what hit her.
[255:04.41]That's all targets taken care of, 47.
[255:06.65]Now gain access to the tornado shelter.
[255:09.90]Yeah, the guy that pressed the button and ran away.
[255:15.20]Who could it have been?
[255:16.26]I can't believe it.
[255:19.40]It's not the guy that just hit the fucking button to ram her and sprinted out the back door.
[255:25.29]Couldn't have been that guy.
[255:26.29]Hey, buddy, you know it.
[255:28.89]Yeah, God, no trespassing.
[255:30.53]Shut up.
[255:31.53]Sorry, brother.
[255:42.26]I don't even care anymore, just get me out of here.
[255:46.80]It's going to where it where is it right there?
[255:53.34]Why is it in the house?
[255:58.97]I don't know who that was.
[256:00.23]I don't know who that was.
[256:01.17]That wasn't a bad guy, but I had to get rid of him.
[256:07.97]I don't know who that was.
[256:08.59]What?
[256:08.69]What?
[256:09.19]Is that Sean Rose?
[256:27.57]I'm just praying that this is Sean Rose.
[256:31.91]No, it's not.
[256:32.63]Wrong face.
[256:34.57]Oh, come on.
[256:36.37]I don't know who looks like that guy.
[256:40.75]Who was Sean Rose?
[256:41.65]Who was he?
[256:45.87]I don't know which one of them he was.
[256:48.55]Does that guy look like Sean Rose?
[256:49.73]My unit.
[256:57.73]Which one of these guys looks like Sean Rose?
[257:00.31]You.
[257:00.53]That guy definitely looks like Sean Rose.
[257:03.70]Look at his face.
[257:04.94]Oh my fucking god.
[257:05.76]2346.
[257:05.78]I have to kill her again.
[257:24.17]Okay, well, let me first of all, I gotta find the first guy that I killed.
[257:28.01]I have no idea where the hell he is.
[257:30.15]Okay.
[257:32.61]Sean.
[257:33.21]Sean Rose.
[257:33.63]Where was he?
[257:54.86]Is that Sean Rose?
[257:56.85]Guys, I'm not gonna lie.
[258:01.47]I have no idea where that guy is.
[258:07.89]I don't have a single clue.
[258:10.91]He's stuffed in some closet somewhere.
[258:13.27]Which one?
[258:13.77]I don't know.
[258:17.06]How am I going to get him?
[258:19.78]There's gotta be somebody in that house that looks like him, right?
[258:23.60]Oh, no.
[258:32.37]I don't know.
[258:32.77]I'm going to have to drag that guy around.
[258:40.44]Wait, was it the guy with the ski mask on?
[258:46.32]There's got to be somebody in this house that looks like him.
[258:50.47]He's in the shed?
[258:50.99]In here.
[258:52.27]Yep.
[258:55.52]Sean Rose.
[258:57.08]Alright, Sean.
[258:58.90]Which one of these bodies is yours?
[259:00.00]Is that him?
[259:08.98]I can't open this door.
[259:10.32]Is he in there?
[259:17.44]He's in... I think he's inside there, but I can't move him.
[259:22.30]Can I replace him?
[259:27.66]Shit.
[259:28.60]He's not in here.
[259:33.38]No, that's... This is Urza Berg.
[259:37.96]Sean Rose.
[259:42.36]Oh, boy.
[259:43.12]Oh, boy.
[259:46.40]In the very beginning of the level.
[259:48.52]They said I could use somebody that looks like him, though.
[259:50.34]Somebody in that house has to look like him.
[259:52.62]I'm going to just wager on that.
[259:58.03]I'm gonna wager on the fact that there's somebody in this house, like the guy that I shot in the face, might look like him.
[260:03.05]Gotta get in that fucking house.
[260:32.24]I can wear the mask?
[260:36.38]Where's the mask?
[260:40.74]Didn't I stuff that guy into the fucking shed?
[260:44.57]Like, I can't even open that door.
[260:45.61]I need to use the 3D printer.
[260:55.36]Oh, dear.
[260:57.58]Well, we got a shovel.
[261:01.83]No, Mask Guy.
[261:03.09]Sean Rose is not Mask Guy.
[261:08.03]Mask Guy was the guy that stumbled in, like, accidentally.
[261:10.33]I'm just going to get in the house.
[261:17.99]That's all that matters.
[261:18.59]It's going to be kind of hard, though, considering I'm not allowed to be in here.
[261:25.90]So I'm going to do this.
[261:31.19]Go in there and, like, look what's in there.
[261:36.28]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[261:38.42]Alright, get in here.
[261:39.66]Come in here.
[261:39.98]Come in, come in, come in, come in, come in.
[261:43.38]Come in.
[261:44.60]Come arrest me.
[261:45.34]Come arrest me in here.
[261:47.14]Get in the fucking house.
[261:48.70]Oh, you dumb shithead.
[261:50.56]Listen up, clown.
[261:51.78]I told you to follow me.
[261:56.95]Stop right there.
[261:58.91]How many times do I need to tell you?
[262:00.31]Follow me.
[262:01.82]Come in the house.
[262:04.91]I don't have time for this.
[262:05.87]You need to follow me right fucking now.
[262:08.81]Come in the house.
[262:12.07]Listen up, clown.
[262:13.17]I told you to follow me.
[262:17.29]I wish he would come in the house.
[262:18.55]Okay, that's it.
[262:19.35]I'm taking you with me.
[262:21.06]Good.
[262:21.44]Now he's going to actually walk in the fucking house.
[262:23.18]What the fuck?
[262:31.21]Oh, my fucking god.
[262:34.17]Give me a fucking break.
[262:36.79]He just yelled at me and wouldn't... Oh, my god.
[262:39.38]What a pain in the ass.
[262:42.00]You clown.
[262:44.94]Your food is fucking terrible.
[262:46.84]I'm just gonna try this tactic, because that's how I got in last time.
[262:56.93]It's called, I don't give a shit.
[262:59.19]I'm getting in the fucking house.
[263:00.55]Oh, what's that?
[263:07.57]I don't give a fuck I'm going in the house.
[263:09.78]Technique worked.
[263:10.52]Now I'm just going to hide for a little bit.
[263:14.70]Hey!
[263:14.96]Son of a...
[263:27.65]Shut up.
[263:27.89]Give me a 3D print of this guy's face.
[263:30.15]There it is.
[263:30.93]Print his face.
[263:32.91]Give it to me.
[263:33.25]He saw a hand come up.
[263:58.39]Get out of the way Where's the door to go down to the basement
[264:27.36]Where's the basement door?
[264:28.59]I live in Colorado.
[264:34.09]I can't confirm.
[264:34.57]Everyone has an English accent.
[264:38.17]No sign of the target.
[264:39.81]Anyone have visual on the target?
[264:41.27]He's in the house.
[264:55.58]Hey, remember when I was gonna get, like, minus five fucking million points?
[265:03.83]What a bad aim.
[265:05.83]Oh my god, seriously, this is so stupid.
[265:12.16]I hate this mission, I'll tell you why.
[265:13.84]Because of the dumb... You're trespassing everywhere without the specific five different costumes.
[265:24.21]I just need to get down the goddamn stairs.
[265:32.04]That's where I gotta go.
[265:41.32]Just stealth it?
[265:42.42]It's not possible.
[265:43.96]This house is full of fucking people.
[265:48.44]This guy's... Yeah, there's a guy right here.
[265:54.71]There's too many people.
[265:55.63]I haven't saved in such a shitty place.
[265:57.63]Oh my god, did I actually do it?
[265:59.07]Oh my fucking god, these guys can all see through.
[266:00.83]They can all see through.
[266:04.61]Where?
[266:23.00]This guy's just like watching porn on TV.
[266:26.18]You can't live.
[266:26.64]I'm sorry.
[266:27.12]You can live.
[266:27.56]What the hell is going on here?
[266:34.66]In the bedroom.
[266:35.66]Ah!
[266:35.94]Boom!
[266:38.96]Hit the alarm!
[266:41.00]Alright, let's go!
[266:42.92]Yeah, I suck at stealth and the whole place is like fucking sprinting around looking for me.
[266:48.10]Echo Foxtrot to Uniform Zoo.
[266:50.16]Understood.
[266:52.90]I think I did it.
[266:55.62]Get out of the fucking way, Danny.
[267:12.06]I did it.
[267:12.38]Oh no.
[267:12.58]Good scanner.
[267:13.94]Look around.
[267:36.53]Oh, look, a map.
[267:38.25]I wonder if he has something to do with the map.
[267:40.71]Look how far it dates back.
[267:42.61]Hayamoto, Beldingford, Delvade.
[267:46.30]The Shadow Client has been tracking you for decades.
[267:49.42]It was too stressful.
[267:50.60]There's too many fucking people sprinting around looking for me.
[267:53.86]And there were no closed doors.
[267:56.26]Every door was blown open.
[267:57.48]Every wall was blown the fuck open.
[267:59.79]Carol!
[268:00.15]Carol!
[268:00.85]Well, at least this shortens the list.
[268:08.98]Wait, what?
[268:09.96]Get me out of here.
[268:14.42]Now what?
[268:15.46]No.
[268:17.69]Some kind of network.
[268:20.47]Power planes.
[268:21.69]That was a shit show.
[268:22.67]It really was.
[268:23.27]Familiar faces, too.
[268:25.41]Thomas Cross.
[268:27.09]Klaus Strandberg.
[268:29.19]Ether.
[268:30.35]And that's missing banker Eugene Cobb.
[268:33.25]Well, well.
[268:33.91]There's a name.
[268:35.65]Providence.
[268:36.59]What?
[268:36.81]No.
[268:40.88]I went in trespassing.
[268:42.66]I just got sick of this mission.
[268:44.30]I don't like this mission.
[268:45.06]So I have to find more info in the boxes.
[269:10.49]you know on the computer on his desk sure thing found something sodas but that would mean Providence has infiltrated ica and those developers I don't know is their operative bastard it all fits he was the one who persuaded the rest of the ica board to green light this operation this changes everything get out 47
[269:37.01]Oh no.
[269:37.35]Thank God.
[269:37.63]Did it.
[270:08.96]Rose is gone.
[270:10.90]It wasn't me, was it?
[270:13.93]They tracked me.
[270:14.97]No, he's the next target.
[270:15.83]I don't believe it.
[270:17.83]I took every precaution.
[270:19.71]Rose knew the risks.
[270:21.85]They all do.
[270:22.81]Maybe it's him.
[270:23.71]You did well, Olivia.
[270:24.73]I am proud of you.
[270:26.56]Now listen.
[270:27.00]Aiming for me?
[270:29.58]The ICA knows about you.
[270:31.86]They kept you alive because they needed you and now they don't.
[270:34.70]Oh, shit.
[270:36.68]We won't talk again.
[270:39.16]Not until the storm is over.
[270:41.29]I don't like it.
[270:43.31]This man, you know what he's capable of.
[270:45.27]You need to end this now.
[270:48.65]I ran away as a boy.
[270:50.73]Why didn't he shoot me?
[270:52.37]My friend and I. Away from that place.
[270:54.91]Take that apricot through customs.
[270:58.43]We came upon a small farming community.
[271:00.39]The people were dirt poor, but this woman, she took us in.
[271:03.47]That was a good story.
[271:10.85]uh if you don't like you don't like this mission any mission because it requires stealth I was pretty stealthy in a few of those missions it's just it just seemed like you would all these people are here for the same reason well we have security and then we have security then we have super secure and then we have ultra security within like 30 feet
[271:32.17]You're trespassing.
[271:33.71]No, sorry, sorry.
[271:34.35]This, like, this one tenth of a mile quadrant of the map, you can't be here.
[271:39.39]And right there, next to us, that one tenth of a quadrant, you can't be there either, unless you have this specific costume on.
[271:47.61]Fuck off.
[271:48.39]You know what I mean?
[271:48.83]That's what I say.
[271:56.94]Hitman crashed.
[272:05.36]It scratched.
[272:06.70]Game crashed.
[272:09.00]I tried.
[272:09.32]I was just getting out of that menu so fast.
[272:16.44]Well, thank you everybody for watching.
[272:18.80]That's where I was going to end it anyways.
[272:20.97]That was fun.
[272:22.93]I appreciate you guys sticking it through the bullshit with like the multiple crashes.
[272:28.09]And it crashed right here too.
[272:29.19]So, you know, that's three crashes.
[272:30.73]Cool.
[272:32.60]I think there's only one more mission left or two more missions.
[272:37.62]We'll do those on probably Tuesday.
[272:40.84]Or maybe over the weekend if I get some time.
[272:42.92]I'll do like a Hitman stream.
[272:44.52]But for scheduled streams, Hitman is probably done.
[272:47.96]Unless I want to do it, like I said, off stream, like scheduled.
[272:51.60]Thank you so much, everybody, for sticking around, because once I get out of Hitman, the stream ends.
[272:56.72]I can't click on anything.
[272:58.44]I wanted to go back and say thanks to all the people that subbed and all the bits that came in, but I physically can't move because the stream's going to turn off if I touch any buttons.
[273:06.07]So... The OBS is going to just crash once I click escape.
[273:16.97]So I'm going to go feed my dog again.
[273:18.22]Thank you, everybody, again.
[273:19.78]Take care.
[273:22.05]Tomorrow is Friday.
[273:22.89]It's Sorcery Night.
[273:23.95]We're going to go through Part 4 again.
[273:25.41]Hopefully we'll get somewhere close to the end.
[273:27.84]If not the end.
[273:30.36]But yeah.
[273:31.74]Have a good night, guys.
[273:32.90]Take care.
[273:33.42]Thanks for sticking around.
[273:34.46]Much love.
[273:36.96]Sorry, again, I can't say hello to the new subs because I'm about to hit escape and that means everything turns off.
[273:47.91]Good night, good night.
[273:49.47]Goodbye, goodbye.
