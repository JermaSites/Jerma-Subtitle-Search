[01:02.84]Sorry, guys.
[01:03.90]That's okay.
[01:04.59]I demand a 15-page apology on my desk by morning.
[01:07.83]My fault, guys.
[01:14.33]I don't even know what that means.

[01:27.93]Because if you ask what literal means, you're being too literal.
[01:32.03]I'm dense.
[01:32.57]Am I dense?
[01:34.02]No.
[01:35.64]That sounds mean.
[01:38.67]I thought the main menu was a loading screen.
[01:44.07]Wait, are they spinning?
[01:46.33]No.
[01:53.13]I got some slob squats going.
[01:56.66]Let me see what the multiplayer I can host a server.
[02:01.27]Max players for
[02:04.27]I don't have Bob.
[02:11.47]I can't show you the server.
[02:13.07]You told me last night.
[02:16.08]Okay I got something I'm going to make a server for this one
[02:28.38]You keep messing with me, sir, I'm going to turn on my fire alarm.
[02:33.22]Do it.
[02:34.61]Do it, little pup.
[02:41.05]Okay, I'm going to drop the server code.
[02:43.04]Do not leak.
[02:44.80]Do not leak.
[02:46.93]Alright.
[02:54.54]The term has been gone a while.
[02:58.70]I think he's putting on his socks and he's leaving.
[03:01.54]I just feel like it's really rude to comment on how long someone's been in the bathroom, but it's been like a
[03:06.92]while and I'm starting to get scared for how long he's been in the bathroom wait I think
[03:18.06]I don't even think that sounds like Yoshi.
[03:22.64]I heard him.
[03:23.67]What psycho Yoshi are you playing with?
[03:27.58]I don't know.
[03:30.14]No server with this code.
[03:31.83]Oh, I haven't started it yet.
[03:37.96]Okay, now I've started it.
[03:38.94]You may join.
[03:40.30]Or try to get in there.
[03:43.96]I'm back.
[03:44.20]I can't even... Oh.
[03:46.90]Alright, this is Misery.
[04:16.13]Okay.

[04:36.22]Check the code in the group.
[04:37.67]Don't leak.
[04:38.37]Oh, okay.
[04:45.60]Who's that?
[04:47.50]Uh, is there no field of view?
[04:50.17]I accidentally started the game without Jerma.
[04:53.26]Oh, hold on.
[04:54.45]What's going on?
[04:55.53]What's going on?
[04:56.31]Flashbacks!
[04:57.49]I think I can just join.
[04:58.33]That's loud.
[04:59.48]I think I can just join.
[05:00.20]Can you just join?
[05:01.48]Yeah, dude, it's loud.
[05:03.27]Okay, good to know.
[05:08.81]I found cream cola.
[05:10.10]Oh my god, this game is loud.
[05:12.07]Are you sure we don't have to restart?
[05:13.94]I'm in, I'm in.
[05:16.74]Let me tell you, the FOV needs to be changed if it can.
[05:21.24]FOV needs to work.
[05:23.19]Is there a FOV?
[05:23.71]Oh, there is.
[05:24.29]It's in game.
[05:27.39]100's good.
[05:30.04]Okay, hold on.
[05:35.47]Turn it up a little bit.
[05:37.90]What is happening?
[05:38.63]I'm shaking.
[05:40.94]What the?
[05:41.38]This hurts my head.
[05:42.34]What is this game?
[05:44.35]Alright, I'm in.
[05:47.14]Oh!
[05:49.11]Flashbang?
[05:50.33]I'm on mid.
[05:51.72]Died.
[05:51.90]Are we good?
[05:52.83]Gather resources and come back before the omission.
[05:54.70]Did we just lose already?
[05:58.15]Yeah.
[05:59.38]I'm so confused.
[06:00.99]Wait, how did you poke to look different?
[06:03.46]Well, I don't know.
[06:04.53]I found a
[06:06.34]He took the crime simulator skin on that.
[06:11.68]Adidas.
[06:13.73]So we have to survive, right?
[06:15.97]Yeah, here's flashlights if you need one.
[06:18.00]I'm gonna turn it up a little bit.
[06:26.49]Alright, flashlight.
[06:33.07]Okay.
[06:33.29]I have cement on me.
[06:35.83]That was loud.
[06:36.54]You were right.
[06:37.06]Why did I turn it back up?
[06:39.46]I picked up the splitter.
[06:41.01]I don't...
[06:48.00]Ow, did you just punch me in the head?
[06:50.99]I think we all have to punch each other in the head a little bit when we start a new game just to get it out of our systems.
[06:55.49]True.
[06:56.78]True, true.
[06:59.66]Cannot equip item.
[07:00.65]Where do you put the flashlight?
[07:03.42]Two or one or three.
[07:05.05]Put it on two and then run with the flashlight out and it looks like you're jorking it.
[07:11.90]hell of an animation oh shit it really does alright so we just stay alive right that's the name of the game
[07:21.41]Yeah, the loot and extract, I think.
[07:23.76]Expedition.
[07:24.44]This is the Expedition.
[07:25.87]What does Cersei mean?
[07:27.31]Cersei or the Expedition?
[07:29.22]Let's check it out.
[07:32.72]Poke it right, there's a lot of head Bob going on here.
[07:36.92]I turn off the Bob of head.
[07:39.31]Can you?
[07:40.31]Yeah, it's nice.
[07:42.78]It's in game as well.
[07:44.95]I'm not a head Bob kind of guy.
[07:46.49]Oh yeah, never.
[07:47.84]Absolutely never.
[07:48.70]What are these guys?
[07:50.94]Are they enemies?
[07:54.40]Hello?
[07:54.89]Hello?
[07:57.93]Are they alive?
[08:00.06]Can anyone hear me?
[08:01.91]Hey, sir.
[08:02.47]Are these guys alive?
[08:04.45]Give vodka to the dwarf.
[08:08.01]We went into the jungle, yeah.
[08:14.71]If I remember right, this game has some decently nice in-game voice chat.
[08:22.99]You guys want to try turning the in-game VoIP on?
[08:25.92]I don't know.
[08:28.33]What is going on in here?
[08:29.36]Set spawn point.
[08:30.95]Okay, apparently we spawn in here now.
[08:34.11]Do we want to?
[08:35.08]Dude, I could pick up a bed.
[08:36.06]There's cement in here.
[08:43.16]I can't pick it up because it's too big for my- oh.
[08:48.35]Nothing in the cabinet?
[08:50.63]I'm playing Seathim again.
[08:51.50]Seathim.
[08:52.93]Seath... Seath... Whatever.
[08:55.99]Oh, shit.
[08:56.51]Knife.
[09:02.09]I don't know how to take out my weapon.
[09:04.70]Oh my god.
[09:05.28]Honking horn?
[09:09.28]Hold on.
[09:16.15]I hate them, whatever that is out there.
[09:17.83]Oh my god.
[09:19.25]What was that?
[09:20.70]Clown?
[09:21.34]Don't hit me with a shovel because I honked a horn in your face.
[09:23.71]I'm dead in one hit.
[09:24.77]I literally have one HP.
[09:26.31]You look like Max Payne.
[09:27.60]I have one HP now.
[09:29.24]No!
[09:31.23]Don't!
[09:32.22]Yeah, but I don't know.
[09:34.98]I have gear.
[09:38.37]Well, we have to find out what happens.
[09:41.59]I picked up a whole toilet.
[09:43.11]I guess I come back to the bunker.
[09:47.59]Can I go home and drop off my loot?
[09:49.11]I have so much loot.
[09:55.49]I found this cool horn.
[09:58.59]Yeah, it is pretty cool actually.
[10:02.14]Is he dead?
[10:03.77]Yeah, the flies got him.
[10:05.56]I'm back though.
[10:08.22]Hey.
[10:09.51]Hey.
[10:14.65]What the?
[10:15.88]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[10:17.89]This guy's over here.
[10:18.73]This guy's over here and they think they have guns.
[10:21.40]Guys... Stop!
[10:26.67]Are you killing them?
[10:30.09]I killed this guy.
[10:31.20]I don't know.
[10:31.68]Kill him.
[10:33.57]I don't know how to use my weapon, my axe.
[10:35.44]How do I use it?
[10:37.97]He's a sewing kid.
[10:39.74]Put on your one.
[10:40.38]Put on your one.
[10:42.23]I can't.
[10:43.49]Oh, now I can.
[10:45.36]Stop killing the innocent!
[10:47.59]What are you doing?
[10:49.42]Are they really?
[10:50.08]I don't trust them!
[10:51.82]I don't- look at them!
[10:52.63]Look at them!
[10:53.29]It's a quest to give them vodka!
[10:56.00]It's a que- ugh.
[10:59.03]Oh shit, actually.
[10:59.76]This one had bread.
[11:00.58]It had sausage and shit.
[11:01.67]Bread and sausage.
[11:04.87]Jerma, your old body has a knife on it.
[11:06.86]Do you need it?
[11:07.72]Yeah, I'm going to get it.
[11:09.59]Where is it?
[11:09.99]In here?
[11:10.93]It's right over here with the flies around it.
[11:13.06]Oh, these dead bodies have things on them too.
[11:15.96]You guys aren't even searching the corpses?
[11:18.80]I'm searching, I just ran out of space.
[11:24.52]I just got radiation from the fucking water.
[11:27.21]Oh my god.
[11:29.04]Alright, let's go.
[11:34.10]No, oh, there's a suitcase I found, alright.
[11:40.56]You're about to pick up the swag.
[11:43.21]Can we group up?
[11:45.52]As a team?
[11:48.08]Can we work together and stop hitting each other?
[11:51.82]Hold on, I died.
[11:52.38]Does he go back to my body?
[11:54.43]I thought you were one of those guys.
[12:00.86]Alright, the people that were chasing me were over here.
[12:03.46]Do you want to go find the group?
[12:07.09]There was a group of these guys.
[12:07.81]It was like three or four of them.
[12:08.70]Should we go get them?
[12:11.01]Alright, everybody back.
[12:13.33]Where my body was, shit.
[12:14.54]I think it was this way.
[12:16.50]Out this way and then to the left is a whole other area with a bunch of people that are hostile.
[12:22.06]I have an axe.
[12:23.31]Was it this way?
[12:24.64]They're, like, yeah, they're out here.
[12:31.32]Does anyone have a gun to shoot them with?
[12:34.16]I have a shovel.
[12:35.59]Cement.
[12:37.16]my my I have a pack of cement the radiation noise
[12:47.17]good he had potato chips gasoline
[12:56.80]That doesn't look what it looks like.
[12:59.71]Yeah, gasoline for the hideout.
[13:02.14]If anyone knows of any way to restore health, please let me know.
[13:04.95]There's vodka here.
[13:05.35]We can give this to the dwarves.
[13:06.97]Yeah, we could have...
[13:07.96]We need a home base or something.
[13:14.42]The bunker?
[13:15.37]In the beginning, maybe?
[13:16.83]Can we build out here?
[13:18.91]Is it like a build menu?
[13:22.66]Did you guys go to this open field?
[13:25.91]I'm just kind of walking around out here.
[13:28.72]Just got a big backpack.
[13:29.81]Hell yeah.
[13:33.07]Guys, if I die, take my backpack.
[13:34.99]Please remember this.
[13:41.25]I think we have to eat.
[13:41.90]You kind of look like you're Naruto running.
[13:44.83]Just a little bit.
[13:45.71]Wait, it says this can be sold to Circe's under... Oh my god, you scared the fuck out of me, man.
[13:51.18]No sound.
[13:52.90]Yeah, I didn't say anything.
[13:53.93]I thought you were an NPC for a second.
[13:55.36]I was like, wait, that's Poke.
[14:00.29]These boxes have loot.
[14:03.65]Man, my eyes are so full of blood.
[14:05.75]The bunker is...
[14:06.42]Okay, I think we have to go... We actually have to go back to the base, I think, yeah?
[14:08.95]Somebody said the bunker is in your base.
[14:10.11]Back to the base and then...
[14:10.95]It says we have to use the cement and the...
[14:14.67]gasoline and various materials to upgrade our base.
[14:18.68]Okay, so I have...
[14:21.57]I have a sewing kit.
[14:24.57]I don't have any room for the cement.
[14:25.85]Poke, do you have room for the cement?
[14:28.13]I have some.
[14:29.14]I have room and I have cement.
[14:31.12]But also, I found a hindee.
[14:33.31]This isn't a hindee.
[14:34.95]This is getting dark.
[14:36.72]Do you know which way is home?
[14:38.05]Um, vaguely.
[14:39.91]No?
[14:40.49]Alright, let's go.
[14:41.94]This way, I think, vaguely.
[14:43.47]Wait, loot.
[14:45.73]Ster, is this, um, a bad idea to be here?
[14:49.07]Those are ghosts.
[14:49.96]More gasoline.
[14:51.91]They look like geysers.
[14:54.73]I got no room for it.
[14:56.56]I have condensed milk.
[14:57.98]I gotta keep selling.
[15:00.29]We probably do need this.
[15:01.40]Bad.
[15:03.05]Um...
[15:04.23]Give the vodka to the dwarves.
[15:06.12]Can I put this anywhere?
[15:10.07]No.
[15:10.79]You can rotate your items with R.
[15:13.02]Oh shit, hold on
[15:18.22]What is that noise?
[15:19.87]I'm giving them the vodka and it's like activating them.
[15:22.20]It gives me a menu that I can tell them to follow me.
[15:24.41]Are you, they're your minions now?
[15:26.84]Yeah, it's like they transform.
[15:29.00]Can you pick up this drill?
[15:31.40]Open, follow, stand still, roam, pick up.
[15:34.57]Dwarf has been picked up!
[15:36.41]Sir, I have a dwarf in my inventory.
[15:38.24]Alright, let's head back.
[15:39.14]Ow!
[15:39.83]A drunk dwarf can be used to craft the dwarf generator at the crafting bench.
[15:44.53]A dwarf generator?
[15:45.70]What do you mean?
[15:46.85]I don't know.
[15:48.84]Ster, we got to get back to the base.
[15:50.65]Poke, I don't know.
[15:52.78]We're going the wrong way.
[15:54.94]I have a memory.
[15:58.38]I think it's this way.
[16:00.77]Hey.
[16:02.98]Sorry, I just ran.
[16:04.49]Apparently, if you run into someone too hard, you hit them.
[16:08.62]Yeah, that's how life works.
[16:09.87]Here's the big feel.
[16:11.55]I guess it does.
[16:14.26]Do you damage if you run into me?
[16:15.32]Like it hurts me?
[16:16.33]I don't know.
[16:16.61]I hope not.
[16:16.85]You're running into me right now.
[16:19.64]No.
[16:20.34]Okay, good.
[16:21.69]Anything in this tractor?
[16:28.13]Wooden toilet.
[16:29.02]Okay, then I think we're close.
[16:30.57]Oh, let me grab that.
[16:33.09]No space or wait for the item.
[16:34.41]Never mind.
[16:36.28]Over here maybe?
[16:39.20]Oh, more guys.
[16:43.36]Wait, we can give vodka.
[16:44.28]Do you have any vodka?
[16:46.49]Nope.
[16:46.94]Oh, yes, I do.
[16:49.12]Oh my god, look.
[16:50.53]Follow.
[16:52.64]This is a weird game.
[16:53.92]Okay, we have a live dwarf.
[16:57.56]Yeah, we got one, uh, two.
[16:59.89]Okay, so we gotta meet up.
[17:01.66]Yeah, airdrop!
[17:02.46]They're bombing us!
[17:04.25]Oh my god!
[17:05.21]Is it actually an airdrop?
[17:05.88]Are you sure?
[17:06.64]It seems like an airdrop.
[17:12.63]You okay, Vinny?
[17:14.06]I'm dead.
[17:15.22]Vinny, you're dead.
[17:16.09]I'm very dead.
[17:18.68]Yeah, don't drink that.
[17:23.65]You can open the dwarf.
[17:27.94]I guess you can.
[17:28.88]Did you, sir, did you die?
[17:30.89]Oh, dude, the dwarf is in inventory.
[17:32.86]He's in inventory.
[17:33.50]We can store items in the dwarf.
[17:37.20]Store items in the wharf.
[17:38.33]Oh, hell yeah.
[17:39.70]Yep.
[17:40.10]Sir, are my items there?
[17:42.55]I don't know if I trust the dwarf, though.
[17:44.82]Just take the backpack.
[17:46.44]Take whatever you need, but the backpack in particular, it'll give you a lot of inventory room.
[17:52.98]Okay, well, he's got some items.
[17:54.26]Bruh, you...
[17:56.67]I'm here.
[17:57.24]I'm coming back.
[17:58.10]I'm just...
[17:58.50]I don't know where you are.
[18:00.28]How the fuck did that target me specifically?
[18:04.08]It dropped it right on- I just happened to be looking up at it.
[18:07.91]So I ran.
[18:09.73]I'm just following the dwarf.
[18:11.64]That's following you.
[18:13.49]You Vinny?
[18:14.71]Yeah.
[18:14.91]Your body's right here.
[18:15.53]Wait, did I just find it?
[18:17.14]It's over here somewhere.
[18:18.62]I think I found it.
[18:19.06]Alright, thanks.
[18:21.13]Wait, where's the...
[18:23.99]And you just came from the bunker.
[18:25.52]I'm going to the bunker.
[18:26.74]Alright.
[18:27.10]I think this is it.
[18:27.84]You picked up my backpack, right?
[18:29.15]Yeah.
[18:29.53]Yeah.
[18:29.99]Let's go.
[18:30.61]Okay.
[18:30.83]You can have that.
[18:31.39]That's my gift to you.
[18:32.23]Oh, hell yeah.
[18:32.86]Little version of me.
[18:34.39]And then turn around and do sursies.
[18:37.88]Wait, where's our little guy?
[18:38.97]Where's the dwarf?
[18:40.37]Oh, no.
[18:40.81]Oh, fuck.
[18:41.44]Where's the dwarf?
[18:45.12]Where's their fucking money?
[18:46.47]Where did the dwarf go?
[18:48.69]I told you I don't trust him.
[18:50.20]I told you I did not trust him.
[18:52.10]Um...
[18:53.42]Did you pick up my inventory dwarf?
[18:56.64]I have your dwarf, yeah.
[18:58.55]Okay.
[18:59.10]There you go.
[18:59.88]Okay, thank goodness.
[19:01.07]I got the gas.
[19:03.12]Sorry.
[19:05.28]Alright, we can bring this stuff back now.
[19:12.12]Yeah, the dwarves won't follow you into the bunker.
[19:16.56]You have to put them in your inventory, maybe?
[19:20.31]Yeah, I've got two.
[19:22.08]So what should we trade?
[19:25.98]How do you sell?
[19:30.48]can be sold to the junk dealer.
[19:33.43]Oh, right here.
[19:35.60]It's me.
[19:35.88]Oh, you have to, like, click it.
[19:38.09]It's... That's strange.
[19:40.40]See what happens, Ster.
[19:41.53]Let's take them dwarves into the base.
[19:44.38]Maybe you can use them to build the dwarf generator.
[19:47.77]Maybe.
[19:49.40]I hope it generates dwarves Okay
[20:00.97]Not enough items?
[20:01.75]Why is it spamming that?
[20:04.15]Oh, here we go.
[20:04.57]Probably should not have sold that.
[20:06.42]We actually have to physically hold the money.
[20:09.87]Wood?
[20:10.78]Let me see if I can chop trees.
[20:11.98]I have an axe.
[20:13.78]I have 33 rubles.
[20:15.94]We need wood and iron and insulating tape.
[20:22.73]My antidepressants.
[20:24.25]Well, this is not Minecraft, so I can't take wood from a tree.
[20:28.70]I'm going back out to look around and loot.
[20:32.06]This is a very strange video game.
[20:34.75]So weird.
[20:35.71]And also the fucking airdrop targeted me specifically.
[20:38.79]It was both of us.
[20:40.35]It was right over our head.
[20:41.90]Yeah, but you had the foresight to run 20 feet away and live somehow.
[20:47.28]He's a gamer, you know?
[20:49.07]He's gaming up.
[20:49.77]I know.
[20:50.94]I understand the game.
[20:51.78]I like it.
[20:52.83]This is my game.
[20:54.47]What about a raw cockroach?
[20:56.00]Isn't a raw cockroach just a... cockroach?
[21:02.86]Now that you say it like that.
[21:09.18]Alright, where's the crafting bench?
[21:11.81]Uh, in the bunker.
[21:15.71]I'm gonna drop off my stuff at the bunker.
[21:17.48]I forgot to do that.
[21:19.63]Yeah, do we have a storage unit to drop the stuff off?
[21:23.22]Yeah, in the bunker where we spawned.
[21:25.55]Oh, in the spawn, okay.
[21:27.02]Where can we plant things?
[21:31.40]Maybe outside?
[21:32.74]Maybe right here?
[21:35.36]What the fuck is... What the... Is there no map or compass or something?
[21:40.89]You probably have to find it.
[21:43.56]There's a compass key for navigation, but you have to check the key bindings.
[21:47.56]No!
[21:48.00]Yes.
[21:52.99]Why are there two dwarves in here?
[21:56.60]Because you need them for the dwarf generator.
[21:59.45]Yeah, obviously.
[22:01.65]It's about to be nighttime, guys.
[22:03.05]It's really spooky out.
[22:10.41]Oh, there's a cabinet out here for storage.
[22:13.00]Just in the floor.
[22:14.10]We should probably use that instead.
[22:15.53]What the hell is that?
[22:17.64]That's bad.
[22:18.10]I don't like that.
[22:19.45]Where's the cabinet, sir?
[22:21.80]Up the stairs.
[22:27.84]I'll put some concrete in there.
[22:33.37]Oh my god, dude.
[22:35.48]You think you're cool?
[22:40.03]I think you're so cool.
[22:42.37]I think we beat the game.
[22:43.46]Oh my goodness.
[22:43.90]You know what I can do?
[22:45.05]I'm not gonna do it, Vinny.
[22:45.96]I know.
[22:49.67]The bunker is a save room.
[22:51.00]You can drop things on the floor and they save.
[22:53.21]Okay, there's a chat member with very helpful advice.
[22:55.68]I'll be taking that advice.
[22:59.01]Alright, so we should move as a unit to where we're going next.
[23:04.61]Anywhere.
[23:05.57]Anywhere but here.
[23:06.82]The map seems really big.
[23:09.15]Alright, well let's go.
[23:09.67]Is that a fart incident?
[23:12.02]I do.
[23:12.56]Fart incident?
[23:13.58]What was that?
[23:15.87]When Polk farted into the microphone really loudly.
[23:18.70]oh yeah I do oh yeah yeah I'm still sorry about that guys I feel so
[23:24.37]I think about it a lot, even though I forgot it.
[23:26.60]He turned the limiter off on his microphone and he farted as loud as he could right into the mic.
[23:30.65]It was so crazy.
[23:35.10]I didn't fart.
[23:35.94]I'm not one of those people.
[23:37.37]I pressed a button.
[23:41.54]I found another dwarf.
[23:42.86]Dude, you can eat this.
[23:45.29]Oh, I just ate shit.
[23:48.15]Is that bad?
[23:49.90]No, that's good for you.
[23:52.43]If it's human, then it came from human, so it's good.
[23:58.08]Oh my god, that's a lot of zombies.
[24:00.93]Never mind.
[24:06.03]So if you press Q, you get a compass.
[24:08.17]We are following the non-red arrow.
[24:17.88]I don't know if that's supposed to be north or south I think the poop is killing me
[24:27.82]so south yeah I figured it was south but it's bigger the arrow is just bigger so I was confused
[24:34.28]I actually think I'm dying.
[24:35.15]Holy shit, there's $35 in here.
[24:39.14]Holy shit.
[24:44.31]does my thing say I'm bleeding from thirsty I'm hungry yeah I'm also what's the eye is that tired level
[24:54.43]It might be sleep.
[25:01.55]I feel like I just went to the next biome.
[25:04.15]Everything just like, the vibe just changed completely.
[25:07.08]Are you outside in the big fields?
[25:09.23]Yeah.
[25:10.50]Okay, yeah, we were at Minster, we're here.
[25:12.40]Oh, I see a big hole.
[25:13.41]The big hole?
[25:15.62]Big hole?
[25:17.02]Can you go in it?
[25:18.12]Yeah, look at me over here.
[25:19.81]You can see me in the distance.
[25:21.83]I made a home.
[25:22.41]I'm coming back to you.
[25:24.78]I think I lost you.
[25:26.49]I'm walking my way over.
[25:28.12]I'm going.
[25:29.02]Tell me when you can hear my honks.
[25:30.37]Don't eat poop, by the way.
[25:34.14]Keep honking.
[25:35.76]Why is it louder when I jump?
[25:41.21]I think I lost your hunks.
[25:45.83]Did you guys go left outside the expedition, or...?
[25:48.97]Press Q, Jerma.
[25:50.04]Go towards the south, which is the non-red arrow.
[25:55.92]That's where we are.
[25:59.28]What?
[25:59.40]Go towards the non-red arrow?
[26:02.21]Yeah.
[26:02.33]Okay, I see you guys.
[26:04.48]Go get your- Oh, my stuff is over there.
[26:05.91]I don't know what that means.
[26:09.40]Oh.
[26:09.61]Hulk, I don't know where you are.
[26:11.14]I don't know.
[26:11.52]I'm going deeper into it though.
[26:13.33]It's into the arrow.
[26:15.16]Where you're pointing.
[26:16.68]I can no longer sprint.
[26:18.03]It's like a rotting corpse in here.
[26:19.87]Oh, don't go in here, it's radiation!
[26:22.20]Oh no, I'm passing away.
[26:24.13]I need food.
[26:24.75]I have food.
[26:27.24]I have food too.
[26:28.67]I need A food.
[26:29.79]Just one.
[26:30.21]There's a carrot.
[26:34.39]Bums!
[26:35.85]Bums!
[26:36.98]I know, I know.
[26:39.12]Did it hit you again?
[26:39.89]It got me too.
[26:43.28]Dude, I can't get out of this fucking room.
[26:46.94]How does it live here now?
[26:50.80]How did I do that before?
[26:51.50]This game is fucking nonsense.
[26:59.32]I jumped over it before.
[27:01.79]This is true misery.
[27:04.38]Alright, the game is called Misery.
[27:07.91]How come you guys haven't been, like, airstriked?
[27:11.42]That's weird.
[27:11.95]It's just me and Vinny.
[27:14.44]Oh, well, now that you say that.
[27:16.53]I think we have to be in the bunker right now.
[27:20.45]I don't know.
[27:21.07]What do we do?
[27:23.34]Why is my vision all fucked up?
[27:25.25]I think we're about to get, like, nuked.
[27:27.58]The flashbang again.
[27:30.36]Because isn't this what ended the game before?
[27:32.36]Oh, cry me.
[27:34.99]Yeah, no, we're totally done.
[27:37.00]This is like mega death.
[27:40.77]Pok, I love how you, like, checked your watch.
[27:48.33]Oh, it's fucking Nuko Clock again.
[27:55.55]I don't feel so good.
[27:59.57]Keep following me.
[28:00.07]I'll take you right here.
[28:01.10]This is the vibe change.
[28:02.58]Vibe change?
[28:03.75]right here oh okay but I think we're gonna die yeah no I got radiation here and died so don't go too deep
[28:17.79]Oh boy, if you sprint too much, it just does not regenerate slowly.
[28:22.63]Is that a bunker?
[28:22.99]What if we crouch in here?
[28:23.88]It does not regenerate quickly.
[28:27.41]I hear radiation.
[28:28.44]Yep.
[28:28.88]Goodbye.
[28:29.54]I'm out.
[28:29.96]I'm out.
[28:31.23]I don't know where I am.
[28:33.48]Wait, there's a house here.
[28:39.83]No loot.
[28:41.48]I don't know where I am.
[28:42.58]I can't see.
[28:45.65]It's just getting whiter and whiter.
[28:54.04]What's going on?
[28:55.32]I think we have to be in the bunker.
[28:58.24]We have to just stay in there.
[28:59.16]It's like a... You're dead if you're outside scenario.
[29:04.20]Yeah, I'm in the middle.
[29:05.12]I'm in the bunker.
[29:06.09]What the fuck?
[29:13.02]Oh.
[29:13.16]Okay.
[29:13.28]You died.
[29:15.66]Lost my $30.
[29:16.38]Okay, bunker respawn.
[29:23.99]Damn, we were so close to getting it.
[29:28.17]Any more stuff?
[29:28.83]Okay, there's cheese.
[29:31.04]Got a sausage.
[29:32.68]There's a magazine in here.
[29:35.77]I need a gun.
[29:37.62]Is this always here?
[29:38.26]Why can't I equip?
[29:39.16]Wait, guys, the map changed?
[29:40.12]He left the door open?
[29:41.19]I didn't die.
[29:41.79]I still had my inventory.
[29:42.93]I think it's procedurally generated.
[29:45.59]The whole map is procedurally generated?
[29:47.26]I think so.
[29:49.21]Oh.
[29:50.92]Wait, I see Jerma's body.
[29:52.10]Are there any more flashlights?
[29:55.95]Oh, fuckers on an elk.
[29:58.45]Shit, I need flashlight.
[30:00.96]Can I go with somebody that has a light?
[30:02.53]Because I don't have a flashlight anymore.
[30:03.45]Yeah, I'm leaving just now.
[30:04.44]We can leave together.
[30:05.08]Why did you decide to punch this thing?
[30:06.28]Why did I help you?
[30:07.69]Why am I dead?
[30:11.43]Okay.
[30:13.52]That was a bad idea.
[30:19.76]Oh, it is?
[30:20.35]Alright, I'm with you, sir.
[30:21.33]We're gonna go left.
[30:22.06]We're gonna go hard left to this building.
[30:24.35]So it just keeps progressing to the next day?
[30:26.12]Is it progression?
[30:27.88]Oh my god!
[30:30.53]Punch him!
[30:31.53]Every time the bombs drop you get a new map so you have to loot as much as you can and bring it back once and repeat.
[30:36.98]he just one he just punched you oh he's got stabbed oh yeah loot until admission hide in bunker every mission new map gets generated
[30:46.46]Okay, that's cool.
[30:53.58]I want my sausage, god damn it.
[30:59.40]We need your body Ster because you had the flashlight.
[31:07.20]That's all I had.
[31:08.18]Press Alt to whistle.
[31:10.93]There's like anomalies and stuff over there.
[31:12.89]I'm going the other way.
[31:14.02]If you press Alt, you'll show up on the map.
[31:16.99]Oh!
[31:17.73]So you can come to each other.
[31:18.85]That's awesome.
[31:20.24]That's exactly what we needed.
[31:21.46]We're not on the map on the screen.
[31:23.01]Yeah, we needed something like that badly.
[31:27.43]Um, yeah, there's a little stalker going on here.
[31:29.67]There's a moose.
[31:30.81]We gotta get that elk.
[31:31.90]It's probably elk meat.
[31:33.71]We're getting spawn camped.
[31:35.48]You cannot kill that elk, by the way.
[31:37.25]I tried.
[31:37.63]He's fucking powerful.
[31:42.87]Oh my god, you are not kidding.
[31:44.28]Ster, don't even try it.
[31:55.21]Whoa.
[31:58.54]This game reminds me of my childhood.
[32:01.74]Need a weapon?
[32:03.87]Alright, I'm just gonna go loot.
[32:05.61]Finally, it's daytime.
[32:06.60]Who the fuck is that?
[32:07.66]Is that you?
[32:08.22]Who the fuck is this?
[32:10.16]He shot me!
[32:11.85]I thought this was you!
[32:13.76]What is going on?
[32:14.46]Why is he shooting me?
[32:15.99]You killed him?
[32:16.69]I got him!
[32:17.17]I killed him!
[32:17.60]He dropped a fucking tons of shit!
[32:20.96]Why?
[32:24.03]You whistle, Vinny?
[32:25.06]Dude, he dropped ammo.
[32:26.32]He dropped a staff.
[32:27.97]Yeah, I'm right with you.
[32:29.52]He dropped a bandage.
[32:31.25]Can you kill me?
[32:32.94]You want me to kill you?
[32:34.20]Yeah.
[32:34.83]Hold on.
[32:35.25]I don't think you want to go in that crater.
[32:36.89]It's a little too irradiated.
[32:38.46]Kinda sucks.
[32:39.02]I'm not.
[32:39.86]I'm not.
[32:40.53]I hate that guy like 50 times, Jerma.
[32:42.71]This game is ghosting really... pretty intensely.
[32:48.80]Okay, he has a hazmat suit on him.
[32:52.35]We can repair it.
[32:57.44]That thing is huge.
[32:58.55]Can anybody even pick it up?
[32:59.40]Would you kill more of those guys?
[33:00.12]Would you kill more of those guys?
[33:01.33]Can you even pick it up?
[33:02.07]It's like too big for your inventory.
[33:06.54]Mr.
[33:07.13]Severe radiation over this way.
[33:12.82]I feel like our day one map was goaded and we didn't understand.
[33:16.75]This is too big for the inventory.
[33:19.06]Look at me.
[33:19.44]Look at me.
[33:19.87]Look at me.
[33:21.09]Yeah, Max Payne.
[33:24.07]Can't equip it.
[33:24.56]Oh, I was about to die.
[33:25.50]I was really just about to die.
[33:27.41]Um, if I die, which I will for sure, take my sausage.
[33:32.39]one possession my sausage I need a backpack you see this orb yeah
[33:39.56]That's a different orb.
[33:41.74]I want to go in the orb.
[33:42.70]I have no health.
[33:43.47]So here, look, take all of my stuff.
[33:45.71]You go in the orb.
[33:47.34]Yeah, I'll go in the orb.
[33:48.60]Here, take my sausage.
[33:49.73]All this stuff is yours.
[33:53.05]Where's the cabinet to store the shit?
[33:55.33]Wasn't it right here?
[33:55.94]I went in the orb.
[34:03.29]Died.
[34:04.29]It just says died.
[34:05.12]Died.
[34:07.67]Okay.
[34:07.79]Alright.
[34:10.64]Well, at least I got your sausage.
[34:13.85]The ghosting is sanity.
[34:16.83]Oh, the eye on the bottom guys is your sanity level.
[34:25.43]uh there's a dude with a machine gun here am I insane hold on what where is this where's the cabinet
[34:38.88]It's right out...
[34:40.23]There's like three different right outsides.
[34:42.76]This game has no hit animations.
[34:47.27]The big orb will teleport you, but it will also do a little damage.
[34:52.59]So Ster.
[34:53.07]That is a safe orb, somewhat.
[34:58.67]What does it do?
[34:59.36]It teleports you somewhere.
[35:01.73]Fuck, we have no room to put any of this stuff.
[35:03.44]What the hell was that?
[35:04.32]But why did you die?
[35:06.00]because it also damages you a little bit while it teleports you.
[35:11.10]Oh.
[35:12.56]I keep advantage.
[35:13.91]I'm at a bunch of frozen in time soldiers.
[35:19.46]Wait, we have a sewing kit.
[35:20.93]Ooh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[35:22.34]I might be able to make a hazmat suit.
[35:28.59]I feel like your fists just can't do anything.
[35:31.19]Yeah, they're terrible.
[35:34.95]I'm going in the orb.
[35:45.18]Yeah, I think I have to do the mask.
[35:46.85]I think I'd be cool looking.
[35:52.95]Ooh.
[35:55.96]Human bones.
[35:56.83]I need a fucking...
[35:59.53]I think we need a sewing machine.
[36:01.98]I see it.
[36:03.10]All of us need to find any kind of anything.
[36:11.10]Good observation, right?
[36:12.73]Click recipes to craft items.
[36:21.85]Does it have to be in?
[36:22.89]How do I leave here?
[36:28.52]Wait, did the orb kill you?
[36:29.95]Like, the weird orb?
[36:31.28]The orb killed me because it does a little bit of damage, but if you have enough health, you can get in there.
[36:37.65]I'm here with you.
[36:38.89]okay the only way out is to go through it again I think oh we need hiding all this loot huh I can't do it yeah we need a sewing machine
[36:48.56]You can equip a metal pot on your head and can't see anything out of it.
[36:53.45]We're in a multi-layered orb situation.
[37:04.27]Yeah, it seems like everything is dangerous over there.
[37:06.37]You can't even go over there.
[37:09.25]Can somebody whistle?
[37:14.92]Thank you.
[37:16.27]Ignore that whistle.
[37:17.88]Ignore that whistle.
[37:19.63]Ignore that whistle.
[37:20.30]We're in a different dimension.
[37:24.78]Whoa.
[37:26.04]Holy fuck.
[37:26.62]Why am I lagging?
[37:27.27]We only have one FPS.
[37:29.49]You guys?
[37:31.16]Dude, Vinny, you had a sick raincoat on.
[37:33.87]Got a sick raincoat.
[37:35.86]Uh, I almost got killed.
[37:36.80]There's some stuff in here to pick up.
[37:38.33]Med kit.
[37:41.03]I just got picked up a human bones.
[37:44.93]Can you whisper, Jay?
[37:46.53]Is those condoms?
[37:48.44]Oh no, those are bottles.
[37:49.56]I'll whisk, I'll whistle.
[37:51.59]I've whistled.
[37:51.89]Are there army people that will kill us?
[37:53.82]They're frozen in time.
[37:56.35]I've checked all that.
[37:58.90]I'm gonna try and head back.
[38:02.47]Oh, there's a TV!
[38:05.06]Stuff in here, there's scrap in here.
[38:06.68]Oh fuck, you got a cleaver, dude.
[38:13.92]Vinny whistle Jerma whistle I think you're too far away you still have my backpack Ster
[38:24.35]No, that's when we got nuked.
[38:26.90]Oh.
[38:27.46]And the world reset.
[38:29.71]That sucks.
[38:30.98]Vitamins.
[38:31.74]Ooh, vodka.
[38:35.42]Yeah, I think bring as much of that as you can with you because it seems good.
[38:41.02]I'm bringing gasoline and shit.
[38:42.75]I wish I had a light.
[38:45.61]Oh yeah, I got one of those.
[38:49.84]They were free in the beginning, but we were supposed to hold on to them.
[38:52.27]We were not good stewards of our flashlights fates.
[38:56.21]There's a shovel here, too.
[38:58.49]We got two.
[38:58.73]Oh my god, this guy has a flashlight.
[38:59.84]Holy shit.
[39:00.94]I need a... Yeah, your backpack seems so key.
[39:03.21]I need a beah.
[39:05.79]Am I dying?
[39:06.48]Yeah.
[39:06.90]No.
[39:07.12]Okay.
[39:18.50]Anything else upstairs or anything?
[39:26.35]Huh.
[39:30.99]Alright, I'm going back.
[39:32.94]Oh no, I could've got this.
[39:35.22]I got gasoline.
[39:39.22]For the generator.
[39:41.15]I have vodka.
[39:41.65]I don't know what it does, but it's full now.
[39:43.42]I've got two or three vodkas right now.
[39:46.08]Coming back.
[39:46.65]No, don't consume.
[39:49.25]You're right.
[39:49.78]I do have that.
[39:56.69]We should figure out and consolidate what is... We need to make a table or a storage unit.
[40:02.26]We got to make some stuff.
[40:05.24]You can drop items in this corner here.
[40:07.17]They stay.
[40:08.78]There's permanents.
[40:09.62]The crafting bench also has an inventory.
[40:11.71]You should put all the crafting stuff in the craft.
[40:13.68]And this bench here too has stuff.
[40:16.64]There's a sausage in here, for example.
[40:22.94]Okay.
[40:27.80]I'm just gonna throw everything on the ground.
[40:32.46]concrete wall and floor.
[40:33.94]We can build our own base too.
[40:39.26]Light bulb, electronics, and scrap.
[40:42.84]Insufficient items.
[40:44.69]I have enough gas that I can now turn on...
[40:49.74]Oh, you've got guests?
[40:53.62]Sometimes.
[40:54.39]Somebody said,
[40:56.73]Oh, that's absolutely massive.
[40:58.80]Okay.
[40:59.90]If you go into your inventory, unequip whatever you're holding, you can drag...
[41:06.62]your weapon into the primary slot so you don't have a bunch of room that you've taken up in your inventory.
[41:12.48]If you haven't done that, do it.
[41:16.27]Oh no How have we not accomplished getting any wood?
[41:22.83]Yeah, what is the wood situation?
[41:24.82]Maybe we go chop a tree down.
[41:25.82]I think it's those little wood.
[41:27.35]Oh my God.
[41:28.33]Yo, yo guys, the weirdest shit just happened to me.
[41:31.84]You're not going to believe me.
[41:33.27]And I'm not going to spoil it for y'all.
[41:35.08]And when it happens to you, you'll scream the same thing I just fucking did.
[41:38.42]Good luck and have fun.
[41:39.98]Alright.
[41:41.05]GG's.
[41:42.80]I don't think it's hitting trees.
[41:44.75]I'm dying.
[41:48.10]Yeah, hitting trees does not give one wood.
[41:50.23]I checked with an axe earlier, even.
[41:54.55]We need to get that plague doctor's outfit.
[41:57.14]I know.
[41:57.71]It looks cool, but how do you wear it?
[42:05.31]I think you have to fix it.
[42:07.28]We need a sewing machine.
[42:09.17]Oh, okay.
[42:10.12]I saw that.
[42:10.56]We could make one.
[42:12.55]People are saying you could sell junk and buy materials in town, maybe?
[42:15.92]I don't know where town is.
[42:21.77]You can select that other...
[42:23.31]When we go back, instead of saying expedition, you can go to that...
[42:25.86]where the town's name is.
[42:27.59]That was earlier.
[42:28.84]I saw that.
[42:29.66]Now I don't see that for this map.
[42:32.59]When you're leaving the bunker, you scroll down one.
[42:35.94]Yeah, you can select it.
[42:37.02]Ooh, electronics.
[42:38.03]Okay.
[42:41.44]You'll have to connect things to the generator via copper wire to power them.
[42:46.15]Though the starting bench is already powered.
[42:48.57]Oh man, this seems like a complex game.
[42:51.72]It's kind of cool.
[42:53.23]There are aspects of it I like quite a bit.
[42:57.37]Like new maps each time you get nuked.
[42:59.86]I like that.
[43:00.43]Whoa, whoa, Ster.
[43:03.48]Can I not pick up this gasoline?
[43:07.58]Yeah, these people take all the actual money you find.
[43:11.66]There's a bunch of traitors.
[43:12.91]Gasoline on me.
[43:19.24]I just can't hold it.
[43:19.94]I'm still looking for wood.
[43:22.15]Did anyone go through that portal?
[43:23.86]The sphere?
[43:24.98]Yeah.
[43:25.38]Yeah, don't go in it.
[43:27.73]Alright, that's all I needed to hear.
[43:31.59]Is it deadly in this?
[43:32.35]It was good, but it's empty now.
[43:33.88]You just like a closed loop of like being damaged by four of them.
[43:37.18]Anyone hear my whistle?
[43:39.39]I can hear you.
[43:40.99]Come to me.
[43:41.43]I'm right here.
[43:46.29]We gotta go where I died, bro.
[43:47.55]I gotta get my hat.
[43:53.00]I need my hat back.
[43:55.27]What do you have for a hat?
[43:57.53]Guys, I feel like based on yesterday that we may be getting nuked somewhat soon.
[44:04.05]That's true.
[44:05.72]We'll have a moment to know.
[44:10.94]They give you a pretty long time to get back.
[44:14.87]yeah but it's pretty hard to tell where you're going when true your screen's pure white I'm just worried about you guys
[44:21.76]The motorcycle helmet dims your vision.
[44:24.30]That's funny.
[44:26.87]Motorcycle?
[44:29.39]Sorry, I just...
[44:30.49]I can't.
[44:30.85]So I have, like, certain stims that I kind of... Getting dark, Polk.
[44:35.51]Getting dark.
[44:38.01]I'm scared.
[44:40.36]dante is cool oh what is this dude what's with all these missile command explosions
[44:46.72]what's with these bands sorry
[44:52.88]You want their vans?
[44:53.92]What, like their shoes?
[44:54.74]No, no, no, no, no, they, they... Oh!
[44:58.22]Forget it.
[44:59.26]Is that a NPC?
[45:00.06]Who is this?
[45:02.58]Who is that?
[45:03.08]Who is this?
[45:03.52]Who is that?
[45:04.02]Oh, it's you, okay.
[45:04.61]Oh my god, Jerma, that's you.
[45:05.59]Oh my god.
[45:06.33]Yeah, you look like... You don't... You look like a...
[45:09.14]Okay, we're good.
[45:10.05]We're good.
[45:10.53]Your name didn't show up until you got really close.
[45:13.92]Yeah, same for you.
[45:15.17]Oh, with me, guys.
[45:15.69]With me.
[45:16.57]Come, come, come.
[45:17.02]We're almost there.
[45:17.88]Ooh!
[45:18.74]I got a cool hat.
[45:20.23]Where are we almost?
[45:21.92]At my ping.
[45:24.58]Alright, I'll go to your ping.
[45:30.37]ping again?
[45:31.58]The only thing I'm finding is misery.
[45:34.37]Which way did I go?
[45:37.18]This way?
[45:38.88]I don't think I went this way.
[45:47.01]sorry Jerma has a few stims welcome to the new age we are streamers so we are inherently a little sick in the head
[45:57.49]I think it's the other way.
[45:58.16]Actually, it's this way.
[45:59.02]It's this way.
[46:00.49]Okay.
[46:00.61]I'll just keep following you.
[46:04.75]I'm out of stamina.
[46:06.07]Well, I think there's a different orb, a different teleport orb.
[46:09.83]Oh my god.
[46:11.20]I actually can't sprint anymore.
[46:14.08]Did you take damage from that poke?
[46:15.63]Yeah, I felt like I did.
[46:18.06]Can one of you guys listen for me?
[46:21.66]Yeah.
[46:22.64]Hey, where's Jerma?
[46:23.85]I have no stamina.
[46:24.56]I can't run.
[46:26.21]Yeah, same here.
[46:31.65]I'm going to check this house, you go check that house over there.
[46:37.41]I found vodka.
[46:39.17]Anybody have any food?
[46:41.01]Oh no.
[46:43.54]What the fuck?
[46:45.57]Oh my god!
[46:49.41]Eat him.
[46:49.75]Eat his body.
[46:50.25]We need to.
[46:54.66]Dude, I'm fully looted.
[46:55.49]In here, Jerma.
[47:03.88]I can't run.
[47:04.82]Do you have any food?
[47:07.65]Yeah, let me check.
[47:08.42]Get in the house.
[47:09.12]I'll look.
[47:13.06]Is anybody near the exit that can whistle?
[47:16.76]We are far away.
[47:18.59]I'm near the entrance.
[47:20.50]I've just whistled, but you press Q and go to...
[47:24.75]Um, you know where it is?
[47:26.12]It's north- Why did the house just turn into a fucking bird?
[47:31.05]Oh, you got Baba Yaga, dude.
[47:32.40]I don't know what you just said or what that meant in any capacity, Jerma.
[47:36.14]That's what scared me last time.
[47:38.11]I mean, I understand the whole time.
[47:39.99]I understand why that's so scary.
[47:41.72]Can we eat it?
[47:44.17]Eat the house.
[47:45.22]I don't know.
[47:46.11]Like, what is this?
[47:46.69]Is this like a funny got you moment?
[47:48.65]This is such a weird sentence.
[47:56.17]Alright, well, I need to eat something.
[47:59.58]I understand why you screamed.
[48:02.35]Vinny left me with his one last sausage.
[48:05.76]I had a motorcycle helmet I had a shovel I had a plastic hammer I had a backpack and it's gone
[48:12.39]I have your stuff.
[48:13.17]I have all your stuff.
[48:14.34]Okay, keep it.
[48:15.43]Please tell me that there's soup.
[48:18.30]And I found my guy.
[48:23.98]If you need more dwarves, there's vodka in my inventory.
[48:30.94]Uh oh, I heard a zombie.
[48:33.77]Oh.
[48:35.04]Oh my god, I just set this as a spawn point.
[48:36.67]I'm looking for food.
[48:37.43]What the hell is going on with that?
[48:39.16]I'll find it right now.
[48:42.80]Come on, a can of soup or something?
[48:52.74]That's not good.
[48:54.49]Do we have spell slots in our inventory?
[48:58.39]Poke, whistle.
[49:01.46]I'm whistling.
[49:02.19]I'm back at the base almost.
[49:05.52]No one else whistle and come to my whistle if you want to find your way back.
[49:09.26]Poke, where's the chocolate?
[49:10.91]You said there was chocolate in here.
[49:15.31]Where is it?
[49:15.83]Did he eat it?
[49:17.22]Maybe.
[49:18.24]Fuck.
[49:18.84]Did you feed the dwarf chocolate?
[49:21.02]I don't think so.
[49:22.09]You're not supposed to feed them chocolate.
[49:23.78]Dude, I'm gonna eat these carrots.
[49:25.89]I'm gonna eat these carrot seeds.
[49:29.74]Just get out, get out.
[49:30.61]Okay, okay.
[49:36.11]Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk, Polk.
[49:45.47]You want me to come to you?
[49:47.00]Come to me.
[49:47.44]No, no, just leave.
[49:49.39]As soon as you find a thing...
[49:51.23]Wait, the tunnel's right there.
[49:52.56]You can make it.
[49:53.10]You can make it, Jerma.
[49:54.07]I cannot make it.
[49:54.99]I'm dead.
[49:56.23]I have one HP.
[49:59.47]I don't see chocolate on the ground.
[50:05.30]Are you still in the house?
[50:05.92]I'm doing just fine, guys.
[50:07.21]I'm just gonna die here.
[50:08.17]I'll come back.
[50:08.99]I'm pinging at the base, so come to me quickly.
[50:11.86]You don't have much time.
[50:13.70]I think my chat just lied to me.
[50:15.37]I swear to God, if you guys open this bunker door and I die...
[50:17.54]I feel like you can die and then run back and make it and then get out fast enough.
[50:20.33]I feel like it's not...
[50:22.34]Almost white.
[50:23.80]It's actually pretty close.
[50:25.36]Yeah, you're dead.
[50:29.31]I can't- I have nothing to eat.
[50:30.56]I have electronic parts on me though, so I really- you really should come back and get my stuff.
[50:37.41]Do you have to close the door?
[50:39.39]Don't go!
[50:42.96]I'm gonna die right next to this car.
[50:45.98]If the bomb goes off and the doors open, I think we die.
[50:49.50]I just realized.
[50:52.85]Well, there goes all that stuff.
[50:57.27]Maybe it's outside here.
[50:59.35]Alright, food is so important.
[51:04.30]Alright, Vinny, your loot's here.
[51:05.88]How'd you get that?
[51:07.19]We can split it.
[51:08.15]I don't mind.
[51:08.61]That's what happens when you recover loot.
[51:11.80]I will take...
[51:14.17]Uh...
[51:15.48]Well, we got stuff that can be brought back.
[51:17.27]Oh my god, you have so much shit, Poke.
[51:18.59]I'll just take... You know what?
[51:22.10]Take the backpack, Poke.
[51:24.95]You can have that.
[51:27.30]Yeah, everything else, I don't mind if you have it.
[51:29.68]The plastic hammer doesn't do anything, but I'll take it anyway because it's funny.
[51:32.51]First things first, I'm getting food.
[51:34.29]I'm not going to be out there without a can of tomatoes or something.
[51:37.74]I'm going to go.
[51:39.89]You need tomatoes?
[51:42.49]Alright.
[51:42.85]I'll put this human corpse in our base.
[51:45.26]Who is this?
[51:48.24]And carrot seeds.
[51:51.03]Wonderful.
[51:56.34]Yeah, we still need wood.
[51:57.98]We really need to, like...
[52:00.73]Figure out how to get those.
[52:01.79]Can't get in here.
[52:02.76]I think if you get the rupials, then you could probably buy wood.
[52:07.68]You can break these wooden boxes and there's stuff in them.
[52:15.86]Yeah, I feel like I'm gonna fight Malenia out here.
[52:19.10]What are these, Magnol?
[52:23.17]Oh, oh, we can make skewers of like rat, like rat skewers or something.
[52:27.72]I'm gonna, I'll put it in the base.
[52:33.99]Does anyone have a hatchet or something to break wood?
[52:36.86]Because this house has...
[52:38.52]I do, motherfucker.
[52:40.29]What of it?
[52:40.85]Can you open car doors?
[52:41.60]Oh, I didn't pick up the actual thing.
[52:43.38]Oh, gotta break every wood.
[52:45.35]Oh, hell yeah.
[52:45.81]The giant block next to the workbench is something you can interact with if you haven't noticed yet.
[52:50.70]Oh.
[52:59.06]Where are those crates?
[53:00.43]I got an axe.
[53:01.13]Here, you can take this back.
[53:03.08]Shovel.
[53:03.76]Thank you.
[53:04.18]Because the plastic hammer does absolutely nothing.
[53:13.52]God, it's dark with a motorcycle helmet on.
[53:16.21]Oh my god, you scared me.
[53:23.53]This is the field where the boss was killed in CQC.
[53:27.53]I've seen this before.
[53:29.82]Nanotechnology.
[53:34.06]Anything in here, boss?
[53:36.45]Uh, it's been looted.
[53:38.52]Oh, a large crop right here we could plant.
[53:40.03]Oh, oh, oh.
[53:43.75]Yeah, bandages too.
[53:45.77]Oh my god.
[53:47.53]Oh my god.
[53:52.24]You should use some of them bandages for yourself.
[53:57.58]How do you know?
[53:59.02]This is the fucking field where you fight Malenia.
[54:01.88]I said that already.
[54:03.77]This is it.
[54:05.58]You see Malenia, I see boss from MGS3.
[54:09.60]But, you know, whatever.
[54:10.81]What are you guys up to in here?
[54:14.73]I found some gasoline in here.
[54:16.56]There's electronics.
[54:20.22]I got a broom.
[54:22.56]Oh, can remove radioactive dust.
[54:27.76]Hey, um, Hoke, come here.
[54:30.64]Jerma, you too.
[54:32.11]I want to give you guys a quick tutorial.
[54:33.42]I got wood.
[54:33.86]I got six wood.
[54:35.87]Use your weapon to break that wooden box.
[54:38.60]There you go.
[54:40.13]Can somebody pick up this planter and bring it home?
[54:42.16]Why is this fucking dead body just here?
[54:43.87]Anyone can pick up this planter right here?
[54:48.63]Large crop.
[54:50.83]Um... See if I can get it.
[54:55.43]I found a wooden wind turbine.
[55:00.03]Anybody want flour?
[55:02.97]I'm going to Home Depot real quick.
[55:04.01]Fuck it.
[55:06.28]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[55:08.29]I found five wood.
[55:13.89]Oh my god, that guy almost killed me.
[55:17.27]There's more people.
[55:19.06]I got to do a deposit.
[55:21.71]Yeah, let's go deep bubble.
[55:23.50]Oh, your shovels can break.
[55:25.55]I think it's this way, yeah.
[55:26.95]Oh, that looks sick.
[55:33.15]You're good at that.
[55:36.86]There's that motherfucker.
[55:38.73]That looks awesome.
[55:41.07]Run into me so you can push me.
[55:47.71]Actually, I'm gonna die.
[55:48.58]Hold on.
[55:51.25]Uh, I actually might die.
[55:52.62]Can I have a bandage?
[55:57.60]Yeah.
[55:58.68]Are we bad as you?
[55:59.79]I got it.
[56:00.07]I'm good.
[56:02.62]Would it be better just to die and come out here again?
[56:04.59]I guess.
[56:05.35]Yeah.
[56:06.93]Yeah, it seems like there's some advantages to dying.
[56:12.02]Vinny, don't.
[56:14.41]What?
[56:14.95]What was it?
[56:17.65]So should we build our base out here?
[56:22.80]Does it continue to get nuked?
[56:26.42]You probably just leave when it gets nuked.
[56:27.96]I have wood scraps here.
[56:30.63]What can we build with the wood?
[56:33.30]Crafting bench?
[56:34.90]We need...
[56:36.77]I guess we already have advanced crafting bench.
[56:39.08]No way.
[56:39.42]It might be a while before.
[56:41.91]I think storage.
[56:43.70]Yeah, definitely another storage unit.
[56:46.99]I've needed a backpack for the last seven hours.
[56:50.52]Actually, I need those.
[56:51.21]Yo, Jerm, I got the sewing kit.
[56:54.60]Yeah, you need a sewing machine.
[56:57.19]Oh.
[56:58.56]Iron bars is what we need for that?
[57:00.07]I should keep the stuff.
[57:02.12]Lamp.
[57:04.09]Okay.
[57:05.86]We need 25 wood and one scrap.
[57:08.13]We need to go back to that town.
[57:11.88]The giant block next to the workbench.
[57:13.41]We're gonna sell some shit.
[57:15.02]Did anyone bring the planter?
[57:16.34]That thing or no?
[57:17.67]I didn't.
[57:18.11]I couldn't.
[57:18.57]I had no room.
[57:20.22]I'm gonna get him plant seeds.
[57:22.01]You can build outside the whole area as a safe zone where loot stays.
[57:25.57]You just have to hide inside the bunker when the emission comes.
[57:31.34]That's our area.
[57:32.75]We own that area.
[57:34.31]It is ours.
[57:35.64]This game's cool.
[57:36.96]Once a day, I have a pretty big omission.
[57:40.67]This thing clears radiation, apparently.
[57:43.84]Radioactive dust from the bunker, I guess.
[57:47.81]It's a massive slot.
[57:53.63]The big machine next to the bench is a scrap grinder.
[57:57.73]Wait.
[57:58.64]Let's split one power source into three.
[58:00.99]This thing turns shit into scrap and everything.
[58:04.20]This incinerator.
[58:05.44]How do we power it?
[58:08.06]dropped a lot of like loot I think you just put into it I think we have an incinerator man we need 10 power we have gasoline too somewhere
[58:16.68]I got gas, I got power, I got everything, tomatoes.
[58:19.48]Yeah, can we power with the gasoline?
[58:21.73]There's a gasoline generator over here too.
[58:23.86]Yeah, I filled it with gas.
[58:25.73]I just don't know what we actually need power for.
[58:28.49]Incinerator.
[58:31.52]There's a turn on button for smelting.
[58:35.16]Oh, to like smell the iron bars.
[58:36.93]Wait, there's cables.
[58:38.17]I have two cables there if you need to power anything.
[58:40.00]Need to wire the generator to the machine.
[58:43.58]Yeah, I'd like that starting goal, chat member.
[58:45.87]Whatever you think would be good for this.
[58:48.90]Where's the generator?
[58:50.02]Wire the generator to the machine.
[58:52.75]Gasoline generator.
[58:53.73]Okay, so we need to wire this?
[58:55.74]There's wire there.
[58:58.82]Where is it?
[59:00.64]On the floor.
[59:01.85]On the ground somewhere.
[59:04.23]Okay.
[59:04.61]It's in the big cable.
[59:07.76]You'll see it.
[59:09.21]Copper wire.
[59:11.81]Okay.
[59:14.71]How do we use this?
[59:16.49]I'm gonna go straight left from the thingy.
[59:18.73]Scrap electronics light bulb equals lamp.
[59:21.66]I want that.
[59:22.51]So...
[59:24.57]scrap we got electronics oh this is this okay I I I'm sorry I got it who's got the light bulb why is it vertical
[59:35.00]Wait, do we need a light bulb?
[59:35.87]I just sold it.
[59:38.87]Uh-oh.
[59:39.39]Wait, what the fuck just happened?
[59:42.49]Here's a goal.
[59:43.18]Okay, get a battery connected to the generator to store some power.
[59:46.07]Then wire the battery out to the burner.
[59:48.55]It's going.
[59:49.03]Ryan, scrap until you can craft a crafting bench.
[59:51.36]Guys, we got power.
[59:52.03]We got power down here.
[59:54.82]Guys, do not go outside and go directly left.
[59:56.42]It's the scariest thing that ever happened to me.
[59:59.64]What?
[60:00.26]I've always been going left.
[60:01.33]What was there?
[60:02.04]The big rock, the priest that just...
[60:04.65]Put gas in the generator.
[60:06.46]And we got power down here, guys.
[60:08.33]We're going to be...
[60:09.42]It's going to be sick.
[60:11.69]They're coming.
[60:12.09]Did you go there?
[60:12.84]The crossing, the floating item?
[60:15.19]The rocks?
[60:16.40]Boom?
[60:17.19]Is this going?
[60:18.04]I didn't see that.
[60:19.06]I went right this time.
[60:20.07]Alright, what are we burning in this thing?
[60:22.22]I don't know.
[60:23.12]Gas and cement?
[60:24.47]Oh, shit.
[60:25.91]We needed that.
[60:26.54]We just burnt the gas and made ash.
[60:28.99]There was a bunch of shit in here.
[60:31.28]We were using this as storage and it just fucking ground everything up into dust.
[60:36.26]Oh, oh, oh.
[60:39.32]Oh, boy.
[60:40.20]Okay.
[60:43.33]I was told to put the battery, fill the battery with power.
[60:51.28]I don't know how to do that.
[60:52.10]How do you connect to K- Oh.
[60:53.69]It's no power.
[60:57.25]I think the dwarves were in there.
[60:59.92]No, no, no.
[61:01.12]It's just two things.
[61:01.83]It's okay.
[61:02.65]Is it?
[61:02.95]Okay.
[61:04.42]It's okay.
[61:05.20]We need to fill this up.
[61:06.07]That uses a lot of...
[61:07.19]He's tanking it!
[61:08.49]Okay.
[61:09.05]So why is it not on?
[61:09.85]I got this.
[61:10.21]I got this.
[61:10.55]So we're going to fill up gasoline.
[61:11.98]Okay.
[61:12.16]I got it.
[61:12.66]I got it.
[61:13.24]That was a horrible idea.
[61:14.39]Sorry about that.
[61:15.21]That was crazy.
[61:15.89]We got it now.
[61:16.94]Watch this.
[61:19.17]Okay, now the wire's gonna be connected to here.
[61:26.80]Lost my fucking leash.
[61:28.08]fill the battery with power.
[61:31.31]It's getting filled slowly.
[61:32.98]I think it already is good.
[61:34.31]We just need to put the cable back on.
[61:38.15]We need more gasoline, which I may have just burned.
[61:41.43]Yeah, I know who wants that.
[61:42.21]Yeah, we need more gasoline.
[61:46.91]Oh, my God.
[61:47.68]Alright.
[61:47.96]Sorry about that.
[61:48.77]Oh, my God.
[61:49.90]Get this flower out of my inventory.
[61:54.08]We need more storage and we need to move things to a corner.
[61:58.44]I can't even see how big it is.
[62:02.88]Okay.
[62:04.18]So now metal objects we can place in here.
[62:06.69]And we can grind them up.
[62:09.14]So what do we got that's metal that we don't care about?
[62:10.78]What about poop?
[62:11.34]Can you grind up poop?
[62:12.21]Alright, wrench.
[62:14.77]No, a wrench is a weapon, apparently.
[62:16.74]Should we grind it, though?
[62:17.66]I couldn't...
[62:18.18]It didn't seem like I could put it on the hop bar, but... What other metal objects do we have?
[62:24.44]Holy shit.
[62:26.36]What about bones?
[62:28.05]I'm- I just- I just got loot.
[62:30.68]Holy fucking, I got loot.
[62:33.11]Plastic?
[62:33.64]Tag yourself.
[62:34.90]Whistle.
[62:37.32]I don't know what's...
[62:38.00]I'm heading over.
[62:38.87]I'm not sure what I should... Maybe the electronics?
[62:43.83]You have to melt metal scrap in its own object.
[62:49.13]It's its own object.
[62:50.10]Metal scrap Jerm, which we have some stored.
[62:52.90]I see it.
[62:54.00]There's too much loot in here.
[62:55.59]But we also don't have enough gasoline right now, so we need to make that happen, because I burned a bunch.
[63:07.68]Which compass direction was home?
[63:09.62]This one I don't know off the top of my head, but I can go to you and pick up some.
[63:15.84]Will you whistle at the door?
[63:19.00]I'm not at the door.
[63:21.04]I've been whistling.
[63:21.75]Okay.
[63:26.14]Okay, I'm C-U.
[63:27.68]I'm calling to you.
[63:29.83]Alright, so I need to... Don't we have gasoline just kind of hanging out somewhere?
[63:33.63]We do, don't we?
[63:34.79]We did... Like I said, I kind of maybe fucked that up.
[63:38.89]Oh, is it empty?
[63:39.58]I...
[63:42.10]it was in the generator it was in the no we're good we're good alright alright now I can turn this on one more time
[63:57.51]Bro, I'm just telling you, we have access to iron bars now.
[64:06.20]I have a ton of them now.
[64:08.11]Nice.
[64:10.00]Yeah, so, sir, I see you.
[64:12.31]See you.
[64:15.02]If you would like to go back to base, I can point you in the right direction.
[64:21.18]Yeah.
[64:25.91]Pig!
[64:29.42]Oh shit, it ran out of power.
[64:30.40]Nice.
[64:30.85]Hold on.
[64:33.13]Ooh, anti-res.
[64:33.62]War trophy?
[64:34.46]Oh shit.
[64:35.73]There's a couple things in this building.
[64:37.17]I'm gonna go back the way you came.
[64:38.70]I need more gas.
[64:39.18]You guys have any gasoline?
[64:40.58]Yo, yo, sir, come here, come here.
[64:41.99]Do you need a flashlight?
[64:43.41]No.
[64:44.39]You need bandage.
[64:45.97]Put the battery in there too.
[64:48.84]Oh shit, hold on.
[64:49.81]Where's the battery?
[64:52.24]What is this?
[64:55.27]I hope I didn't just break it.
[64:58.21]Oh shit Vinny there's like a weird ass bunker over here too Vinny Vinny Vinny I have too much stuff I gotta go back
[65:07.83]Yeah, I'm also... Oh, Vinny from Vsauce.
[65:12.22]How bad do we need a car battery?
[65:14.61]Oh, hold on.
[65:16.13]Yeah, we definitely get a car battery.
[65:22.32]Tag again?
[65:23.27]Ster?
[65:23.73]Whistle?
[65:26.81]I just found the whole thing of gasoline.
[65:28.36]Am I over-encommed?
[65:32.79]I have too much fucking stuff.
[65:35.13]I'm too good at this game.
[65:37.34]Why am I not generating any stamina?
[65:40.34]Is that all food related or is that also because you have too much weight?
[65:52.95]Let's go.
[65:53.62]I don't know how to get back.
[65:55.23]Someone, someone ping?
[65:57.25]The door?
[65:58.91]Oh, I'm at the door.
[66:00.75]Thirst and hunger.
[66:02.34]You guys didn't look at the tutorial?
[66:04.95]Yeah, we kind of didn't hear it.
[66:07.57]Hey, we're learning.
[66:09.44]Yeah, we're having a good time at least.
[66:11.16]The exit is
[66:15.39]When arrow points east west, I fucking want this thing is like so odd.
[66:21.77]It's like the top isn't north.
[66:24.12]I don't know.
[66:26.33]Okay, well, what can we do with the iron bars now?
[66:32.69]Alright.
[66:34.32]We can make a ton of stuff.
[66:35.59]If you guys bring back more wood and scrap and stuff, we can make- finally make a sewing machine.
[66:41.87]Let me in the crafting bench.
[66:45.06]Who spoke?
[66:49.06]Hello?
[66:50.39]I'm...
[66:51.48]I'm not... Oh, you know what?
[66:52.44]I thought you were talking to me.
[66:54.05]I am.
[66:55.50]Um, where are you?
[66:56.77]I can't open the crafting bench.
[66:58.35]I think you're using it.
[66:59.52]Um, you're not even here.
[67:02.80]I'm right in front of you.
[67:04.12]You are not in front of me.
[67:06.62]Okay.
[67:07.92]Are you seeing me swinging?
[67:09.60]I need a sausage.
[67:10.86]No.
[67:12.07]Um... What?
[67:14.89]What?
[67:18.29]I see you out here.
[67:19.09]I just teleported here.
[67:21.19]Oh well, hi.
[67:25.31]Okay, so let me give you a brief explanation of how this works.
[67:28.74]Because I just spent the last 10 minutes figuring this out while Chad helped me.
[67:33.47]You can attach, the wiring can be attached
[67:39.50]to anything that can generate power, like a car battery, for instance.
[67:42.69]You can use the wire to attach to dunk, to dunk, and it'll power it.
[67:47.51]You also can use a generator.
[67:49.93]Generator needs gasoline.
[67:50.89]You fill up this with the gasoline, then you do the same thing with the wire.
[67:56.42]and it'll have power.
[67:57.31]But you can do it with a battery too, but the battery also needs power.
[67:59.81]We only have one more battery left.
[68:02.08]And if you look in here...
[68:03.90]I know where another car battery is.
[68:05.77]Well, but we have access now.
[68:08.58]I dropped it off.
[68:11.64]So we have iron bars now?
[68:13.43]What do you guys want to make?
[68:15.97]I think we should make a...
[68:18.41]I found gasoline.
[68:19.44]Well, you need an advanced crafting bench eventually.
[68:21.93]You got gasoline?
[68:22.57]Hell yeah.
[68:23.83]I need help, though, because I'm dying.
[68:26.71]I need sausage or something.
[68:28.22]I can't run and I'm...
[68:31.17]I might need someone here to help um do I have any sausage here we need to figure out the wood situation it's crazy
[68:43.00]I think it's those little wood, like, half trees that look white.
[68:45.73]Do you know what I'm talking about?
[68:47.39]Birch.
[68:47.75]I tried hitting them.
[68:49.08]Gasoline generator would be huge, too.
[68:53.28]I have no food, Vinny, but I'm going to where I died.
[68:55.18]I think I have some.
[69:00.13]If not food, then I just need someone here to grab this gasoline.
[69:03.38]Here, I'm here.
[69:05.73]Maybe you could try these?
[69:07.94]Do you need heels, or just...
[69:10.98]Mm-mm.
[69:11.99]Kills I'm okay on.
[69:17.20]We're gathering so much trash.
[69:19.38]That helps.
[69:20.38]Yeah, that helps.
[69:22.03]Yeah.
[69:22.91]Now, in here, Poke, is where the gasoline is.
[69:26.08]Okay, I'm gonna get my shit right here and then come back.
[69:28.55]Gasoline?
[69:31.06]gasoline.
[69:33.21]I love that song.
[69:34.01]There's another battery back here too.
[69:35.98]We should be out of power for a little bit.
[69:39.60]Um, where is the base?
[69:45.84]The shit base?
[69:48.39]Where's our base?
[69:50.84]Who fucking knows, man?
[69:51.48]I don't know, dude, but it sure does belong to us.
[69:56.82]Oh my god, I don't know what that memes is.
[69:59.34]God, oh my god, I crack myself up, you know what I mean?
[70:02.88]Sometimes these memes make me laugh.
[70:04.96]I like memes.
[70:06.69]Oh my goodness.
[70:08.94]Mimis.
[70:11.07]M-M-A.
[70:12.18]M-M-As.
[70:15.96]Are you tagging the base?
[70:17.84]No, I'm running back.
[70:18.78]You guys need to come back.
[70:19.50]I know where it is.
[70:20.48]I need to get the battery.
[70:22.01]Did you get the gasoline?
[70:22.93]I'm dumping stuff in.
[70:24.39]I'm dumping stuff in the world.
[70:27.57]Might be able to do two runs.
[70:30.43]Oh, no.
[70:30.67]I might get airdropped here.
[70:34.32]Never mind.
[70:35.94]I survived the airdrop somehow.
[70:37.61]Holy shit.
[70:39.46]Base is on my ping.
[70:40.98]There's a weird orb in the sky.
[70:42.63]Do you see that?
[70:43.01]I can't pick up the guitar.
[70:44.49]Yeah, I saw it earlier.
[70:45.72]Yeah.
[70:47.87]I'm going in.
[70:48.58]It's in that house you just left?
[70:53.53]Battery?
[70:55.50]The battery?
[70:56.78]The gas, I mean.
[70:58.41]Uh, it was the house that you met me at and you dropped off the cream soda.
[71:04.40]Everybody in?
[71:11.82]I got the gasoline.
[71:18.59]I'm so screwed.
[71:19.41]Burn the guitar for heat?
[71:20.98]Can you do that?
[71:21.41]I'm going for it.
[71:22.21]Am I gonna make it?
[71:33.50]Y'all are gonna fucking die out there.
[71:36.40]Where's in the house?
[71:37.24]Where's in the house?
[71:39.01]It's just messed up.
[71:39.71]It's scary.
[71:40.13]It's in the, like, shed outside of the house.
[71:45.18]There's no hope for you guys out there.
[71:51.78]I don't know where, but I got a homemade antenna.
[71:53.57]That's it.
[71:53.98]I'm going home.
[71:54.60]I'm not making it.
[71:55.61]Fuck!
[72:01.87]Oh, I could use an apple right about now.
[72:04.37]Can I clean this?
[72:06.18]Maybe I can clean up with the...
[72:13.40]I brought some scrap.
[72:14.98]Oh, well, here we go.
[72:16.49]Oh, that was a tomato.
[72:18.16]So I just said, that's a tomato, asshole.
[72:23.32]How do you clean?
[72:32.82]I got a flashlight here for anyone who needs.
[72:37.30]Just gonna drop it right there.
[72:39.13]Have fun.
[72:40.94]I'm going to go sell this boar trophy.
[72:42.94]It seems like it'd be worth some money.
[72:44.19]I'm going to burn the trash.
[72:47.55]There's a lot of garbage in here.
[72:49.10]That creates pollution.
[72:54.95]What?
[72:55.61]Now what are you going to tell me is wrong now?
[72:58.52]You're doing pollution.
[73:01.17]Is there a better melee weapon on the ground here?
[73:02.70]Because I want to come adventure with you guys.
[73:07.55]There's boars.
[73:09.38]Someone says, Jerma's playing House Flipper.
[73:15.72]Jerma, come on.
[73:16.74]Come collect chairs and stuff.
[73:18.13]You can make a house.
[73:19.94]Dude, that's so cool.
[73:22.36]Do we have a better melee weapon than the ground?
[73:26.20]I swear there was a knife.
[73:28.25]There's a knife in the back of the room.
[73:29.80]This place is trashed.
[73:31.83]Next good goal will be planter box and some seeds.
[73:37.69]yes but how do I sell this the item here put this in the
[73:43.17]How do you sell items, guys?
[73:44.64]Do you know?
[73:45.70]You have to go to the city.
[73:48.71]I'm in the town.
[73:49.70]I don't know who to sell it to.
[73:50.80]The boar trophy.
[73:53.20]uh the item itself might say who it sells to what the what the hunter
[74:08.94]Okay, where are you guys at?
[74:10.47]Can I get a ping?
[74:12.91]Thank you.
[74:14.34]Can't you find your own loot?
[74:15.52]I still don't have a bjekpek.
[74:17.95]I don't have a bjekpek either.
[74:20.18]Bjekpek!
[74:27.96]These guitars probably sell for something.
[74:30.47]I'll sell it.
[74:35.52]You're gonna miss the entrance.
[74:36.97]And Ruples.
[74:38.13]That's an interesting death position.
[74:42.23]Man, that didn't sell for a lot at all.
[74:44.34]Jesus, cooked venison's 55?
[74:46.02]And I got 10 for that?
[74:48.45]Wait, that's it?
[74:49.37]10 Ruples?
[74:51.36]Ruples.
[74:53.25]Wait, what about back here?
[74:55.10]Oh man.
[74:55.70]Why is this place so dark?
[74:58.73]This place is very dark, you're right.
[75:00.37]That wasn't worth carrying around.
[75:08.04]What a rip!
[75:14.06]Poke, I found two or three of your body.
[75:18.19]Yeah.
[75:19.74]Did it have loot?
[75:20.81]It did.
[75:21.19]You had a handmade antenna.
[75:24.04]Yeah, that's what I had before I died.
[75:25.01]This thing is gigantic.
[75:26.25]I can't even carry it.
[75:28.64]Buying is a last ditch effort.
[75:30.31]The main focus is looting and crafting.
[75:33.40]Okay.
[75:33.52]Alright.
[75:37.80]I don't think I can even pick this antenna up.
[75:38.93]Well, I'm gonna bring back some sick loot, if you guys don't mind.
[75:43.01]Bring back the sick loot, yes.
[75:46.41]Uh-oh, I see a guy.
[75:47.46]Are you a friend?
[75:53.78]I kind of want this, but there's no way I can carry that.
[75:57.30]I go depot.
[75:59.10]Why am I still not regaining stamina?
[76:00.83]Am I broken?
[76:04.40]Yeah, what is going on here?
[76:09.26]Wait, I can use my other slots.
[76:11.55]You're starving.
[76:12.32]I just drank energy drink though.
[76:15.01]That doesn't feed you.
[76:16.06]OK.
[76:20.82]I mean, I disagree, but whatever.
[76:24.87]I wonder when we're going to get our first yun.
[76:29.49]Apparently that antenna can sell for a lot.
[76:32.56]I'm going to try to sell it.
[76:34.71]Put the flashlight between your cheeks.
[76:37.10]Okay, dude.
[76:38.12]Enjoy the time out.
[76:49.71]Where's the junk trader?
[76:51.21]Come here.
[76:54.11]You have an antenna on the table that you deal on.
[76:56.54]This has to be worth a lot, right?
[77:01.30]24 rubles.
[77:04.69]Pretty good.
[77:08.86]Maybe I'll buy some scrapers.
[77:10.35]Maybe I'll buy some scrapers.
[77:11.09]We need the antenna for the last boss.
[77:13.06]Very rare item.
[77:13.81]Do we have that?
[77:14.29]Oh, dude, I fucked up.
[77:16.20]Oh, shit.
[77:18.02]I fucked up, dude.
[77:19.25]I'm so sorry.
[77:23.66]Alright, I'm gonna... Five rubles for one wood?
[77:26.90]That's fucked up.
[77:32.38]How much wood do we need to make shit happen?
[77:34.89]How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck couldn't chuck wood?
[77:38.95]Food?
[77:39.57]How much what do we have?
[77:41.50]I'm buying wood.
[77:49.66]You're kind of almost better off just dying when you're this debuffed.
[77:53.59]Jesus.
[77:54.55]Vinny.
[77:56.00]Yeah.
[77:57.51]Keep going.
[77:58.81]Okay, I'm going.
[78:01.46]I'm just saying.
[78:03.81]It's gonna be a fucking tomato or something.
[78:05.48]Oh, poop.
[78:06.00]Good.
[78:06.36]I'll take that.
[78:06.88]Oh, there was a poop knife!
[78:09.27]Guys, I found a literal poop knife.
[78:12.04]Huge.
[78:14.41]Biss.
[78:17.30]Oh no, this is radiation.
[78:21.93]There's a bunch of shit.
[78:23.60]Oh wait, is that food?
[78:24.28]I can't find anything out here.
[78:27.33]What is that?
[78:28.00]I found wood.
[78:28.52]I found eight wood.
[78:31.07]Is that good?
[78:32.36]It's pretty good.
[78:36.07]Okay, we have to have a better system here.
[78:40.34]We have shit...
[78:42.03]It's everywhere.
[78:44.14]There's this random loot everywhere.
[78:46.63]There is no system.
[78:48.24]Stop fighting it.
[78:48.83]We need storage.
[78:49.47]We need to have place it.
[78:50.86]I'll handle this.
[78:51.88]You guys enjoy your adventure.
[78:53.43]Let me take care of the home here.
[78:55.94]It got me.
[78:57.95]Enjoy your adventure.
[79:01.59]What kind of guy?
[79:02.15]The walking house got me.
[79:14.06]I just ate a tomato seed, I probably shouldn't have done that I was here
[79:24.22]God, need to clean up.
[79:25.26]I'm so hungry.
[79:25.96]He says, look at this, look at this.
[79:27.67]Of course three men live here.
[79:30.13]Okay.
[79:31.54]Okay.
[79:37.07]Alright.
[79:38.30]What was that?
[79:40.66]It says ammo.
[79:41.36]Oh.
[79:44.07]Oh, I can choose the respawn point.
[79:45.88]Why didn't I choose it?
[79:47.42]Weird.
[79:48.70]This is for the recyclables?
[79:49.65]Maybe I just didn't press the button.
[79:54.91]I think there was like a choice that I missed.
[80:04.95]Man, I hope this whole world just gets fucking emissioned.
[80:09.49]You can pick up wardrobes and stuff for storage.
[80:13.10]This is a post-Coclipse world.
[80:16.24]Wait, what?
[80:18.30]What did you say?
[80:25.79]flower yeah this is going we need to have like an organic section lighter this is just like scrapping materials I'll put the wood here too
[80:38.09]There's ammo and shit.
[80:45.35]This is fucking disgusting.
[80:47.08]I can't pick that up without a backpack of some kind.
[80:50.61]Get that away from Mike and what I'm doing here.
[80:54.32]Alright.
[80:56.76]I'll put money... Money's gonna go in the corner.
[81:02.29]I could hear you coming, but also still funny.
[81:17.58]Oh shit, The Last of Us.
[81:19.55]Why is the poop knife not allowed to be a secondary weapon?
[81:22.08]Why can't the poop knife go on my weapon slot?
[81:25.77]That's weird.
[81:26.54]You should spread your cheeks and hold it that way.
[81:32.02]Return to poop.
[81:33.97]What are these black crystals in the air?
[81:37.70]They deal damage to you, I'm pretty sure.
[81:39.44]Do we need more cables back at the base?
[81:43.82]I think we have a good amount.
[81:45.79]Yeah, we got two or three already.
[81:47.32]Alright.
[81:54.10]Radio that can be sold to the junk dealer Plunger that can be stuck anywhere
[82:02.32]Pull your ass apart and stick it in there.
[82:04.53]It's a fucking joke.
[82:08.61]This is for food and organics.
[82:13.84]We'll put like cigarettes can be under here.
[82:18.67]Gear.
[82:19.13]Actually, no, no, no.
[82:19.65]This is where the gear is going to be.
[82:22.79]You're being so helpful, honey.
[82:25.64]Somebody has to do this.
[82:26.53]This is out-fucking-rageous.
[82:28.03]I would say this is out-rageous.
[82:33.16]Uh-oh.
[82:33.77]He's mad.
[82:34.27]I found a jar of pickles.
[82:40.44]Bring it back.
[82:40.94]I'll try.
[82:41.24]I'll make us a soup.
[82:42.48]I found the gnomes.
[82:45.15]I've got so much cool stuff in here that I can't scavenge back.
[82:52.28]hey Jerma so if I have a bunch of stuff should I just drop it all in a pile that you have huh
[82:59.51]Where's the appropriate place to drop all of this garbage?
[83:03.24]Drop it literally in front of me, I'll take care of it.
[83:07.39]Where's the base again?
[83:08.46]Oh my god.
[83:12.47]I really gotta pay attention to the compass.
[83:28.18]Plastic is there.
[83:31.03]Excellent.
[83:31.54]Okay, this is gear up here.
[83:35.89]Uh, wrench would be classified as, uh, utility tools, which is going to be... Oh, you'd... Grr.
[83:46.08]there's an advanced crafting bench I feel like how do we get electronics well our next goal according to my chat member should be to create a planter
[83:56.59]We have small crop pots we can make.
[83:58.79]I have six electronics.
[83:59.61]How much do we need?
[84:01.16]We got electronics out here.
[84:02.24]There's a lot of them.
[84:04.51]There's like 17.
[84:07.09]I feel like I went through the whole map.
[84:09.01]I clicked to make them?
[84:10.26]Where did they go?
[84:12.03]Except for this place.
[84:13.42]Radiation.
[84:14.08]I need the base.
[84:16.19]Anyone have a red suit?
[84:19.53]Rad suit, no.
[84:22.94]No.
[84:27.33]Very nice, okay, very good.
[84:30.13]this bandit tried to cut me.
[84:33.20]And I'd do it again.
[84:34.10]Stop it!
[84:40.98]I'm sorry.
[84:42.62]I don't know how to use the sewing kit.
[84:48.46]It's fine.
[84:48.90]Insulating tape.
[84:52.97]No, don't eat it.
[84:54.02]I'm going to pick up the tape.
[84:56.71]I'm keeping the poop.
[85:01.46]Did somebody put poop over here?
[85:04.43]No, but I will.
[85:05.66]Come look at this.
[85:06.95]Open the small crop and explain to me how you power it on with fuel.
[85:13.37]Do we need more cable?
[85:14.96]Maybe sunlight?
[85:17.17]Do you put the seeds in the fuel?
[85:18.28]I don't believe we need more cable.
[85:23.60]Hey, hey, what are you doing?
[85:25.22]I'm putting all that in the fucking crafting thing because you need it all in the crafting thing.
[85:28.37]For some reason, Jerma just scared me.
[85:30.34]He's scaring me.
[85:31.96]I'm sorting all of our bullshit.
[85:35.09]Do you know how much glass is down?
[85:36.32]Look at the glass bottles that you fucking...
[85:39.01]brutes keep drinking and throwing down.
[85:41.02]I was just saying we needed electronics and I was wondering where we get electronics and apparently you put them all outside.
[85:45.25]I just said, did you not hear me say that I have 17 electronics?
[85:49.20]No, I totally ignored you.
[85:50.47]That's, well, hey, exactly.
[85:51.75]Hey, where's the, did someone ping where the entrance is?
[85:53.92]I'm, I'm, I'm buckled.
[85:57.39]Thirst suit.
[86:00.20]Nah, Poke, you're gonna die.
[86:02.77]I'm being fuckled right now.
[86:03.91]Oh, that's a tourist suit.
[86:05.72]That's not a thirst suit.
[86:06.88]Okay, this is...
[86:07.67]I'm gonna do medical stuff, like, here.
[86:10.60]Where's all the iron bars?
[86:12.09]Because they should also be in this.
[86:15.39]They're in the incinerator.
[86:22.26]I thought it was like a still suit from Dune.
[86:24.11]I'm gonna call cigarettes medicinal.
[86:26.44]Just, I'm just going to.
[86:28.25]Yeah.
[86:31.90]We got an artifact detector.
[86:37.90]Selling kit.
[86:39.08]It's fine.
[86:41.02]I'm gonna put this wrench somewhere.
[86:42.03]I'll put the wrench with the gear, whatever.
[86:43.19]No.
[86:45.08]Don't fuck with the system.
[86:48.27]Put it right here for now.
[86:51.52]Man, I can't pick up cupboards.
[86:53.21]That shit takes up a lot of space.
[86:57.06]Did you figure out the small crop?
[87:02.29]Uh, I did not.
[87:03.54]I haven't given it much attention.
[87:04.57]There's still a lot of shit to go through here.
[87:10.49]No space or weight for this item.
[87:12.84]Put poop in the planters, maybe?
[87:17.20]Maybe.
[87:19.84]Maybe water.
[87:21.06]It's usually four by three.
[87:26.24]Did someone ping how do I get out or like close to it?
[87:31.03]Yeah, that safe is not being picked up anytime soon.
[87:33.50]I'm still wearing the skirt.
[87:40.68]Oh shit, school backpack, hell yeah.
[87:46.46]I'll go whistle.
[87:48.69]I made the bussy detector.
[87:50.93]You found it?
[87:52.88]Press R to rotate things in your infantry.
[88:03.98]Um, I found a really good suit that has excellent storage if anyone wants...
[88:09.04]The field jacket?
[88:11.41]Shit's good.
[88:12.33]Tourist.
[88:14.23]It's called the... Don't eat it.
[88:17.33]Tourist suit.
[88:18.82]Hey, Jerma, I got a bunch of loot for you at the depot.
[88:21.67]Drop it down, please.
[88:22.79]Appreciate it.
[88:28.99]Excellent.
[88:31.18]Wonderful.
[88:37.07]Could they just nuke us already or what?
[88:41.09]I'm ready for World 2.
[88:42.75]I wonder if it's better if I die.
[88:48.48]Sometimes it is.
[88:49.20]That's nice music.
[88:51.59]I did, I put the poop in the pot and I convert the seed, maybe.
[88:56.76]I'm proud of you, honey.
[88:57.85]It's doing it.
[88:58.45]It's doing it.
[88:59.63]Shall we?
[88:59.96]It's really nice.
[89:01.36]Hey, Ster, shall we?
[89:04.04]You want to take a shall we with me?
[89:09.68]Okay, I have a lot of cool stuff.
[89:13.05]I really need to not die.
[89:15.80]Oh my God.
[89:18.82]Oh, fuck, I'm hungry.
[89:20.08]Good thing I've made our good food corner.
[89:24.63]Jerma, I have some stuff that you're gonna really like, but I need help finding my way back to the base.
[89:29.05]Can anyone help me?
[89:29.89]Don't anyone get him out?
[89:31.72]It's fucking...
[89:33.52]Would you guys want to do a 24-hour challenge one day?
[89:37.36]24-hour what kind of challenge?
[89:39.63]Hell no, Poke.
[89:42.43]I'll give you four.
[89:45.14]Four-hour challenge.
[89:46.71]The four-hour streaming challenge.
[89:48.59]I was sitting in a house in Phasmophobia for 24 hours.
[89:52.98]I'd hang out in real life for 24 hours and like just, you know,
[89:57.79]Play games, watch movies, eat a dinner.
[90:00.30]But man, I can't sit at my computer for 24 hours.
[90:03.28]I don't think I could do it either, honestly.
[90:05.80]There might have been a time in my life where I could have attempted something like that, but I don't think I got it in me anymore.
[90:13.27]I feel that.
[90:15.52]Yeah.
[90:20.35]Everybody in, everybody in.
[90:22.06]Bunch of wussies.
[90:23.20]Bunch of wussies.
[90:27.90]Bunch of wussies.
[90:31.22]Dude, there's a game for it.
[90:32.16]I'm sad I couldn't get somebody that suit, because it was so good, but Jerma, you're gonna love
[90:38.83]You're gonna love this.
[90:39.99]Wait until you see this cool stuff I have.
[90:42.41]I'm ready to see what you got.
[90:43.97]Ready?
[90:44.88]Watch this.
[90:46.18]Watch this.
[90:49.95]Holy shit, this looks expensive.
[90:51.07]Alright, here we go, here we go.
[90:52.42]Bam.
[90:53.42]Look behind you.
[90:56.73]Dude, you gotta... Oh!
[90:59.47]Wow.
[91:00.27]I'm not gonna die if I'm in sheep's wool.
[91:01.50]Not one, but two.
[91:02.92]That's a big... You just made my job so much better.
[91:08.34]Wow.
[91:09.10]Excellent job, Vinny.
[91:10.59]Are you hungry?
[91:11.23]I'll be taking care of this tomorrow.
[91:12.48]I am starving, actually.
[91:14.37]Cheese.
[91:15.05]Wow.
[91:15.99]Look at you taking care of me.
[91:18.20]Yeah, check this out.
[91:18.96]That was delicious.
[91:19.62]Raw cockroach.
[91:21.05]Raw cockroach?
[91:22.09]Delicious.
[91:23.07]Should I eat it?
[91:24.58]I thought I got some pretty good loot.
[91:26.51]It hurt me.
[91:26.83]I don't think it's going to kill me.
[91:30.19]I thought I brought a lot of loot for the base.
[91:31.78]I mean, maybe another hideout needs me.
[91:35.55]I got an axe for anyone who wants it.
[91:37.52]Pope, you brought some very good stuff.
[91:39.80]A poop knife right here.
[91:42.03]Two items right on the ground there.
[91:43.57]Two poop knives and stuff.
[91:45.74]I've got carrot seeds, if anyone needs carrot seeds.
[91:49.77]Let's start getting a load of this guy.
[91:53.29]Guys, I have the boosty detector.
[91:57.18]He thinks he's all that.
[91:59.05]He really just thinks he's all that.
[92:01.99]We got base drama.
[92:04.33]You're putting money on the ground.
[92:05.46]We can do a search for Artifact tomorrow with Debussy.
[92:08.59]Imagine if this was real and I'd be weird.
[92:10.66]Like, petty like that.
[92:12.71]You guys would just kill me in real life.
[92:13.80]Like, just... What the fuck?
[92:15.59]And he's so distant and he's like the fucking deep distance saying, you guys should kill me.
[92:23.72]Just kill me.
[92:25.02]We made it.
[92:31.00]Alright, I'm getting an early start.
[92:33.04]I'm going to go find my... Yeah, I'm going to get out there.
[92:34.61]I'm doing well.
[92:35.33]I have a lot of good...
[92:36.60]Wait, let me see you guys off.
[92:41.68]Bye.
[92:42.54]Wait, let me see you off.
[92:43.62]I'm going to be working back here.
[92:46.88]No, I want to see you off.
[92:49.76]We need to work on getting replenishable food, so we need to plant.
[92:54.57]Oh, we got some planters.
[92:55.51]That's nice.
[92:57.00]I'm not getting any school lunch.
[92:58.49]Nothing before I go.
[92:59.77]Okay, boys.
[93:00.40]Come back with something good.
[93:04.07]Take care.
[93:04.49]Don't get hurt out there.
[93:07.56]You guys want to stick together for this one?
[93:10.25]Don't throw the poop away.
[93:11.26]It's good for some stuff, apparently.
[93:13.26]Look at this mess.
[93:14.47]I'll take care of this mess.
[93:16.03]I'm gonna go to Ster.
[93:16.76]Ster does not want to group.
[93:18.86]Ster's over here, we'll get him.
[93:20.97]I told you guys, I'm trying to search for the artifact.
[93:23.58]Jar of tomatoes?
[93:24.73]Anybody hungry?
[93:25.81]I am not hungry actually, my hunger is good.
[93:30.82]No one loots faster than me a player ever to play with.
[93:34.92]I loot so fast.
[93:36.44]You really did, Gramp.
[93:39.98]We want to grab all them tomatoes.
[93:42.29]Okay, never mind.
[93:44.36]This is just for money.
[93:46.57]Follow me, guys.
[93:49.58]This is the cell pile.
[93:52.60]Stuff that only can be sold.
[93:54.25]This is the...
[93:54.93]Okay.
[93:55.37]I like my system so far.
[94:00.89]Alright, what do I want?
[94:02.04]Radiation over here.
[94:03.39]That guy had really good items on it before last time I checked him, though.
[94:07.52]I'm going for it.
[94:08.10]This looks a little sketch.
[94:09.07]I don't like what's going on here.
[94:11.00]At these, um... Power.
[94:13.97]Oh my god.
[94:17.97]Where did you go?
[94:18.73]This is gonna be weapons.
[94:19.93]If you see power lines with strange, like, wind effects, do not walk through it.
[94:26.19]Walk around it.
[94:27.65]It'll launch you, and it'll do fall damage to you.
[94:32.71]But I'm over here.
[94:33.81]I'm going to be looting these cabins.
[94:37.49]Oh my fucking god!
[94:39.30]Oh my god.
[94:40.04]What happened?
[94:42.16]Got him.
[94:43.61]Oh, the house thingy?
[94:45.35]Holy shit.
[94:49.03]Medication tent.
[94:53.96]You should stand under the house when it sits down.
[94:59.58]That's what I was talking about earlier.
[95:02.14]That's crazy.
[95:04.24]Remember I screamed?
[95:05.10]Yeah.
[95:05.72]Yeah.
[95:06.59]Yeah.
[95:07.37]Hmm.
[95:07.53]I get it now.
[95:09.05]You understand.
[95:10.84]Oh my god.
[95:12.07]Well, it worked.
[95:12.98]Why is this one turned on?
[95:14.39]Wait, what?
[95:22.31]the point of this place I haven't detected even the slightest hint of a buzzy a buzzy is that how you pronounce that it's kind of funny
[95:33.85]All these years I've been saying it incorrectly.
[95:36.65]Buzzy.
[95:38.32]Oh, it's going.
[95:40.33]We're going to have...
[95:40.79]Isn't buzzy like a man's buzzy?
[95:42.86]We're going to have fresh tomatoes and fresh cucumbers.
[95:46.27]Germists, we're all talking about something different at the same time.
[95:49.58]Buzzies, tomatoes, and dwarves.
[95:54.01]You could kill the dwarves.
[95:54.96]Sometimes they got stuff.
[95:56.63]That was, yeah.
[95:57.34]I don't know if you want to murder these guys.
[95:59.91]Hey, if you guys get, if you have to poop, poop in the, um, the crop buckets.
[96:03.89]Put it in the fuels.
[96:04.93]Yeah.
[96:09.46]This is not a great map for loot so far.
[96:12.57]Oh, guys, if you have, like, a suitcase in your inventory, you can loot inside the suitcase.
[96:18.01]Does that make sense?
[96:19.33]yeah like put your loot in it like no we don't need all these guitars honestly we're gonna have a music tent just yeah maybe like keep yeah throw them somewhere oh yeah
[96:29.32]I'm actually just out here looting like crazy.
[96:36.85]I'm having fun, guys.
[96:38.00]Now that we figured out some of the game's concepts, I get it.
[96:41.22]I like it.
[96:41.98]Oh, so like you weren't before.
[96:43.85]No.
[96:45.54]I wasn't understanding some of it.
[96:47.00]No.
[96:48.29]That was a very clear no.
[96:50.46]No.
[96:50.94]Hey, Ster or poke whoever's near me.
[96:53.35]I found an underground bunker.
[96:56.14]It looks valuable.
[96:58.83]I saw that before.
[97:01.52]There wasn't much in it when I went in one.
[97:04.48]Kind of wondering what this giant pit is.
[97:08.03]Oh no, he's dead.
[97:10.06]No, no, no.
[97:10.71]He's dead.
[97:11.91]It's making funny kill you noises.
[97:18.61]This would be the food area, potentially.
[97:21.37]I need a flashlight.
[97:22.26]Oh, good thing I know what that is.
[97:33.28]Computer.
[97:34.93]Give this guy money.
[97:38.01]Oh no.
[97:42.54]Stop to sell here.
[97:46.60]That's not bombing me, right?
[97:49.69]Maybe.
[97:50.05]No.
[97:52.70]Computer, give this man best loot.
[98:03.84]Computer, generate 55 gigabytes of Lola Bunny porn on Mr. Data's hard drive.
[98:12.29]Make it so.
[98:14.40]My mom's calling me.
[98:17.16]She heard me say that.
[98:18.50]She's like, you cannot be streaming with this guy anymore.
[98:24.26]He's kind of a freak I don't know what to do with these
[98:35.33]Which one of you is this?
[98:39.80]Hey, um, sir, do you have any bandages?
[98:43.51]No, I just don't get hurt, so I never have them.
[98:46.97]Oh, I need to drink some water.
[98:49.98]There's a lot of stuff over here.
[98:52.66]Is they?
[98:53.12]Yeah.
[98:59.33]There's a big cable over here.
[99:03.31]Okay, I can take that.
[99:04.67]And they was... What else was they?
[99:08.50]Uh, there was a campsite over here.
[99:10.93]I'm just like eating all the food.
[99:15.52]There's a sofa.
[99:18.29]We could bring it to the base.
[99:20.14]Oh, there's a handmade antenna here.
[99:22.91]I do have a lot of space.
[99:24.98]Can you say hello to my friends?
[99:26.58]Your friends know that your mom's birthday?
[99:29.32]Happy birthday, mom.
[99:30.91]Happy birthday, mom.
[99:33.32]It's her birthday the other day.
[99:35.65]They all say hi to you.
[99:37.09]That's amazing.
[99:37.85]Happy birthday.
[99:39.68]Mom, these are all really famous men.
[99:43.65]Yeah, sure.
[99:44.17]All the really famous men.
[99:45.68]Can you say hi to them?
[99:48.46]Hi.
[99:49.63]Your followers are famous.
[99:51.31]No, it's a collaboration.
[99:53.14]We're at work.
[99:55.26]we'll talk after mom I love you love you
[100:05.69]that's funny oh it's cute that's cute yeah I like that wow
[100:13.44]Very interesting.
[100:14.52]Alright, I'm back.
[100:15.09]Sorry about that, guys.
[100:17.38]You should feel bad.
[100:23.83]I gotta get this skeleton out of here.
[100:25.22]It's just unsightly.
[100:27.66]Was that you?
[100:28.30]No, she was on the phone, right, Poke?
[100:30.87]Yes.
[100:32.11]Oh, that was a phone call.
[100:33.34]She's stressing about the weather.
[100:34.56]Holy shit.
[100:35.49]Yeah, that's fair enough.
[100:36.87]I mean, and also, she's worried.
[100:38.41]I get it.
[100:39.14]That's good.
[100:42.14]How is it so far over there?
[100:45.90]Sir, you have a window close to you.
[100:47.61]Can you check?
[100:49.01]Uh, it's not supposed to like actually snow until tonight.
[100:55.08]That's how lazy I am.
[100:58.06]You know, right now it's going to snow overnight.
[101:02.12]Yeah, it's gonna be bad tonight.
[101:03.25]Stirred, let me know.
[101:04.57]We have also, overnight here in New York, it's supposed to be...
[101:09.50]Oh, you have nighttime there too?
[101:11.15]I miss the snow.
[101:11.84]We have nighttime.
[101:13.25]You just can't let us have anything.
[101:16.96]Jerma, I'm going to be real.
[101:18.66]We had like four snows already here in New York.
[101:23.06]I'm fucking over it, dude.
[101:24.94]I can see that.
[101:25.74]I can understand that.
[101:26.78]I don't understand why people like snow.
[101:28.49]I'm sorry.
[101:29.29]I love it.
[101:31.70]I'm a hater.
[101:32.14]It's just too much.
[101:32.82]It's just too stressful.
[101:37.36]It is stressful.
[101:38.08]And it's like, even in New York, we're more used to it.
[101:41.14]We have the infrastructure for dealing with snow.
[101:43.43]it's just it just sucks and it like gets everywhere and it's coarse and irritating and then like when they salt everything it's coarse
[101:53.19]Everything will be salted.
[101:55.94]And then you bring shoes inside?
[101:58.69]Exactly.
[102:01.12]It's just a mess.
[102:02.52]Shoes and then like they're salty shoes.
[102:05.21]I don't like salty shoes guys I'm just going in portals
[102:12.91]No, I don't wanna go in there.
[102:14.70]I went in.
[102:17.66]Just be careful, hun.
[102:19.84]Okay.
[102:26.67]Is a radio worth big money?
[102:29.26]Big money, maybe?
[102:32.23]Does anyone need a good...
[102:34.09]Does anyone need a good clothes?
[102:39.66]no I'm going on a hunter vest it's insane it's a game changer oh really
[102:46.98]It's like a whole second backpack.
[102:55.76]Where should I put this?
[102:56.51]Does anyone need a hat?
[102:57.68]A Petshuac hat?
[103:00.37]Ah, there's a hat here.
[103:03.20]I have this one already at the base, but could be kind of cool.
[103:08.29]I died in the portal.
[103:10.24]So what's like our current goal?
[103:15.69]Keep looting garbage, I guess.
[103:17.19]Keep looting shit.
[103:20.78]I need to run back to my body or I'm going to freak out and have a really bad time for the next five minutes.
[103:24.70]I think you can open other clothes.
[103:27.33]Put stuff in the inventory and then put the clothes in your inventory.
[103:33.68]Oh, if you're like a cheater?
[103:35.11]That's crazy.
[103:36.77]You can do that.
[103:39.26]Oh, if you're like a cheater.
[103:42.05]No, that's a game mechanic.
[103:44.02]That is a fair and cool game mechanic.
[103:48.85]That's like Tarkov.
[103:49.84]When you guys come back for the night, I want to show you the system and I want to show you where things are.
[103:56.15]So it's clean, and you know where to go for what you want.
[104:00.15]Okay, so I need help getting back.
[104:01.08]What do you guys think of the word chud?
[104:03.10]What do you guys think of this word chud everywhere?
[104:05.44]Everywhere.
[104:08.51]Is it everywhere?
[104:09.65]For me, yeah.
[104:11.10]Oh, I see it once in a while.
[104:13.35]Sure, yeah, yeah.
[104:14.18]I remember using the word chode.
[104:17.43]Dude, you're a chode.
[104:18.56]It's a little different.
[104:19.78]Yeah, I've called people chodes.
[104:22.68]Chud has taken on a semi-political connotation.
[104:27.40]Oh, really?
[104:29.16]Not really, not fully, but enough of one.
[104:32.67]I can see it, though.
[104:34.56]Yeah.
[104:35.23]But for me, I just thought...
[104:36.45]I don't know.
[104:37.58]I picture a guy who looks like...
[104:41.67]like a Van Gogh piece.
[104:44.72]Like, I don't know.
[104:45.79]I just picture like a, like a, a dude who, I'm trying to think of what he looks like.
[104:50.47]I see a top lane on NeatLegends.
[104:53.71]I see.
[104:55.90]It's very specific.
[105:00.68]Guys, I'm being followed by a bunch of ninjas.
[105:04.63]I'm gonna fucking die.
[105:05.85]Oh god.
[105:06.86]This is bad.
[105:09.04]Dude, I got fucking... Where the...
[105:12.30]If anyone finds the orb, ping me.
[105:16.07]Help, someone please help me find the exit back to the base, because I am about to get killed.
[105:23.14]No.
[105:24.43]Please.
[105:26.46]Help him, Ster.
[105:28.06]Help him now.
[105:29.23]Ster up, please.
[105:31.32]Jerma, go out there and can you ping?
[105:33.15]I'll run up and ping.
[105:35.58]Genius.
[105:36.04]Yeah, that's it.
[105:37.57]I have a lot of good stuff.
[105:38.53]I don't want to lose it.
[105:40.00]Why are you dying in real life?
[105:42.64]I've been sick for a while.
[105:44.00]I don't know why this keeps...
[105:45.83]I'm Westland.
[105:46.43]Thank you, Jerma.
[105:47.25]I'll be right there.
[105:47.86]I'll be right there.
[105:48.30]Have you been sick for like a month?
[105:50.99]Yeah, it's going on about a month now.
[105:52.89]It was worse.
[105:53.28]Do you need me to make you, like, soup?
[105:55.84]I've had many soup.
[105:57.99]But you do need my secret soup.
[106:01.37]Like, you have a secret code.
[106:03.80]Crazy Helping Sick hasn't been patched yet.
[106:06.72]there guys they clone things now but they can't patch sickness there is a full
[106:15.47]military convoy with, like, seven or nine people.
[106:22.19]Oh, fuck.
[106:23.52]But are they real?
[106:25.15]They usually don't move.
[106:27.62]I lived.
[106:29.13]You guys alright?
[106:31.05]Yeah, I lived.
[106:33.90]I hope we don't find a gun yet.
[106:35.49]That's kind of crazy.
[106:37.11]They have guns.
[106:37.91]I just found the fucking military has guns.
[106:41.44]Kill him.
[106:41.89]He doesn't.
[106:44.40]We got a couple of plastic hammers you can use.
[106:51.30]Oh my God, he's trying to weed you.
[106:53.65]The frozen in time military areas are like environmental storytelling.
[106:58.31]Oh.
[107:01.54]Okay, great.
[107:02.39]I made it back.
[107:03.77]Okay.
[107:04.17]I found my freaking death.
[107:06.54]Is that you out here, Jerma?
[107:08.43]I whistled and I'm back in the base.
[107:11.75]Oh, okay, cool.

[109:32.23]Okay, this is like the electronics and...
[109:35.73]doodad stuff that we can like anything that's actually grindable and smushable it's like it's the materials pile
[109:45.69]I would say.
[109:48.49]And then in here...
[109:51.18]I'm still working on it, but...
[109:53.05]The back.
[109:54.06]Gas is gonna go in the left corner.
[109:56.33]batteries are going in the right corner and then any of the electrical splitters are going to go over here.
[110:01.41]No one's looking at me.
[110:03.47]I just got here.
[110:04.25]No one was following you and looking, by the way.
[110:08.01]Alright, folk, come on out.
[110:10.20]Do we have any wood?
[110:11.25]Do we have any extra wood?
[110:14.12]Yes, there is.
[110:15.37]I have some right here, sir.
[110:16.27]There's wood.
[110:16.55]Where's the materials pile?
[110:18.26]Where's the materials pile?
[110:20.09]Can you put the materials in the crafting bench?
[110:22.44]Because then you can craft...
[110:23.49]Yeah, but I'm saying when you guys come back, you can dump it in the correct spot.
[110:28.07]You know what I'm saying?
[110:28.63]I have a bunch of wood and stuff.
[110:29.84]But the correct spot is in the crafting bench.
[110:32.85]No, the correct spot is in this spot because it'll get lost.
[110:36.00]Trust me.
[110:36.99]Alright, Polk, you ready?
[110:38.47]I'll do it one more time.
[110:40.30]How do we make iron bars?
[110:42.72]This is the medical tent.
[110:43.71]Yeah, this is the medicinal and medical tent.
[110:46.70]Okay.
[110:48.20]This is the food.
[110:48.92]If you have poop, please put it in one of these two crop containers.
[110:52.71]But how do we make iron bars?
[110:58.35]Okay, iron bars Ster is you have to... Let me explain first.
[111:03.35]I gotta tell Polk about this.
[111:05.09]Yeah, but these are the more important things.
[111:07.46]Well, you got somewhere to go?
[111:08.51]Yeah, I gotta make the iron bars so we can make the advanced crafting bench so that we can escalate our fucking game.
[111:14.84]You grind up that shit in the incinerator and it makes the iron bars.
[111:20.76]What shit?
[111:21.64]the scrap grind up scrap and it'll make iron bars you have to do you know how to connect the power you do right no
[111:32.79]Let's do that tutorial first.
[111:37.09]Okay.
[111:38.50]So, this requires power to operate.
[111:41.96]You can either do that with a
[111:43.05]car battery if it has power in it, which there's a bunch over here, or if you have gasoline, you fill the generator.
[111:50.11]See, stored power is 0 out of 300, you put, you know, 300 fuel.
[111:54.40]Then, once you do that, you pick up a wire, or cable,
[111:58.15]you then place you hit right click it in your inventory place and you'll go boink is a little indicator you stick it there and then you go boink stick it there
[112:08.14]And it'll connect.
[112:09.13]Why wasn't that wired the whole time?
[112:11.96]Because Ster came down and he was ripping cords out and yelling and it was ridiculous.
[112:16.48]um he started like throwing like the radio down he was how do I how do I end the boinks
[112:23.67]To end the boink?
[112:24.89]It's still making me pull.
[112:26.36]You can pick up the cable just by picking it up like that.
[112:28.53]Just hover over it.
[112:28.93]There's a whole person in here.
[112:32.61]So if you open up the incinerator, there is so much garbage in here.
[112:37.74]Yeah, we got to incinerate it.
[112:39.71]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[112:41.56]Hold on.
[112:42.10]Hold on.
[112:45.70]Alright.
[112:47.28]Put some gas, please.
[112:48.56]Let's see if you can do it.
[112:49.77]Put some gas in the tank.
[112:52.98]I connected this car battery.
[112:55.49]Oh, it has no power.
[112:56.54]It has to have power.
[112:57.35]I don't have space for gas.
[112:58.90]Oh my god!
[113:00.08]That was the loudest fucking thing ever.
[113:02.06]Sorry.
[113:03.75]In a while.
[113:04.97]Alright, well, hold on.
[113:05.58]Alright, we need- I'm gonna fill up the- I'm gonna fill this with gas.
[113:09.89]Okay, this has got gasoline, now we get a wire.
[113:11.92]I've got a wire.
[113:14.82]Doink.
[113:15.48]I got it.
[113:16.23]Doink.
[113:16.69]It's connected.
[113:17.78]We are now burning the trash.
[113:20.71]Hey, Douglas, it's me, Mr. Doink.
[113:23.20]As you can see, open up the incinerator.
[113:26.31]We got... How do I get rid of the fucking cable?
[113:30.41]Don't get rid of the cable, the cable...
[113:33.87]Hopefully to return to something better.
[113:36.09]We're burning somebody's body.
[113:39.17]I would love to have my body burned, Douglas.
[113:44.11]Can we just kill ourselves and farm infinite?
[113:47.72]we need bombs coming bomb scrap the scrap pile over there it's currently we're currently cooking
[113:56.28]So get in.
[113:57.02]We turn into iron bars, right?
[113:58.75]Yeah, scrap turns into iron bars.
[114:01.26]We did run out of fuel.
[114:03.01]I'm glad we spent all the fuel burning a fucking dude's body.
[114:06.47]I'm putting scrap in here.
[114:08.20]Yep.
[114:09.39]And you want to stick it in the convert section.
[114:11.20]That's where it actually breaks it down.
[114:13.17]I think actually it'll pull it from storage if something's in here.
[114:17.17]So make sure the only thing that's in here is stuff you want to burn.
[114:21.44]Can someone ping me?
[114:22.63]Never mind, I think I could find it.
[114:23.93]Do you have a copper wire?
[114:26.03]I don't know, the burn goes in the storage?
[114:29.57]Burn just goes into the storage, whatever you're burning.
[114:33.20]Whatever you want to burn, you want to put it in the convert.
[114:35.33]There's four slots.
[114:37.22]Get rid of the body because it uses a shitload of fuel to burn that.
[114:41.66]We just wasted a ton of fuel.
[114:43.77]Makes sense I thought them I see
[114:47.85]So let me, we need more gas, I have distilled gas.
[114:52.00]Okay, now it'll turn back on.
[114:54.81]Now we're burning again, we're cooking again.
[115:00.35]And here come more bars.
[115:08.83]Drum, I have another gift.
[115:10.82]Ooh.
[115:13.16]Aw.
[115:14.04]Is it another cabinet?
[115:15.01]Dude, you are the cabinet king.
[115:18.56]Yeah, apparently.
[115:21.87]Um, I have a military jacket here that does really well against the cold.
[115:27.82]It's got good storage.
[115:29.12]Close the door?
[115:29.69]Okay, door's closed.
[115:36.42]Somebody shit on the floor?
[115:37.26]That's actually great, because we need it.
[115:41.82]It's the best place to shit.
[115:49.73]That's going in the out-of-context Jerma compilation.
[115:52.80]Where's the ammo pile?
[115:55.01]Ammo pile is outside.
[115:58.12]Yeah, I poke.
[115:59.06]Let's keep going over what we were going over.
[116:00.95]So where are you, Poke?
[116:01.90]Right here?
[116:02.58]In true irony, now I need scrap.
[116:04.73]So this is the materials is like scrap and wood and tape.
[116:09.05]Just drop it right here.
[116:10.74]this is the glass glass and plastic so bottles of booze vodka plastic bottles just put them right here we'll figure it out
[116:19.28]This is gear.
[116:20.51]This is weapons and kits and whatever.
[116:24.36]Okay.
[116:24.44]This, okay, right here is stuff that you can only sell at the junk guy.
[116:28.84]So this doesn't have any purpose besides selling it.
[116:31.29]Over here is the ammo pile, so just any ammo that you have, drop it right here.
[116:36.86]Also, I put the gun cleaning kits here.
[116:39.93]Because I don't know if we're going to need them probably eventually.
[116:41.74]But this is kind of like the weapon section.
[116:44.43]This is the foodstuffs.
[116:45.61]So anything like rice and jar of tomatoes, can of stew.
[116:48.74]Just put it here.
[116:49.30]We'll figure out what to do with it at some point.
[116:52.75]Also, this is the guitar section.
[116:55.36]If you have a guitar, just bring it over there and drop it.
[116:57.37]We can just sell it all eventually.
[117:00.17]Okay.
[117:02.67]Hey, sir.
[117:03.66]You needed scrap?
[117:06.29]Uh, not anymore.
[117:07.99]Oh, okay.
[117:10.19]Do you?
[117:10.75]I'm gonna... No.
[117:12.16]I'm gonna throw down... Where's the sewing kit go again?
[117:14.61]I got it.
[117:14.99]I see.
[117:15.19]Right here.
[117:15.51]Right here.
[117:15.84]Okay.
[117:17.58]I got it.
[117:18.15]It's a good system.
[117:19.25]You know, fine.
[117:20.64]It's good enough for now.
[117:24.35]Do one of you guys want that tourist suit?
[117:27.89]If you're going to go adventuring, you probably should have it on.
[117:30.46]It's a bunch of extra slots.
[117:32.23]Med kits in the medical tent.
[117:34.11]There's the tourist suit.
[117:35.74]There's also a military suit.
[117:38.25]So there's, like, plenty of soot.
[117:40.64]Oh, look at that crafting bench.
[117:43.99]That's all gonna despawn.
[117:45.62]What?
[117:46.36]No.
[117:47.45]I feel like it would have already.
[117:50.50]There is an anomalous military base with crazy radiation out here.
[117:58.39]Wait, do you guys actually have rad suits?
[118:01.44]No.
[118:02.77]The radiation's not that bad, actually.
[118:04.27]Never mind.
[118:05.46]I just...
[118:08.16]I found a gun in here, but I can't loot it.
[118:11.33]Oh, also, money?
[118:12.37]I'm gonna take this out, actually.
[118:14.50]Can you jump on my head?
[118:16.08]I hear you and I see you.
[118:17.37]Look at this, look at this.
[118:20.07]up there oh fuck oh run run run run get in get in oh what happened
[118:27.85]Why is that so loud?
[118:28.79]You guys alright?
[118:29.88]Holy shit, do you hear this?
[118:32.40]Do you hear this noise?
[118:33.85]No.
[118:34.15]It's like a loud, low bass rumble.
[118:36.64]Yeah, it's very loud right now.
[118:38.71]Yeah, it's fucking... Yeah, I don't know what's going on.
[118:42.43]I'm gonna go make some money.
[118:48.27]I'm gonna do a selling spree here.
[118:49.77]So hopefully I can make some money for... We can do what we... Oh, oh, Jerma, check the jacket for that antenna.
[118:55.92]You can sell that.
[118:57.15]Oh, okay.
[118:59.54]So there's a gun up here.
[119:00.48]How did you find the gun?
[119:02.69]Oh, I see it too.
[119:03.73]I see it too.
[119:06.12]Oh, I have an idea.
[119:08.68]Furniture.
[119:09.77]It's up there.
[119:11.05]It's the portal you...
[119:12.07]If we get up there, the portal will lead you to the... We might...
[119:15.63]Wait, wait, wait.
[119:16.13]We might be able to grab furniture and place it down.
[119:19.89]Oh, an axe right here, too.
[119:21.42]Who needs an axe?
[119:25.19]To the head?
[119:25.85]Green beans.
[119:28.87]Something is irradiating me to death over here.
[119:36.10]It's quite painful.
[119:37.41]I think this is what we do.
[119:41.29]Can we stack on top of each other?
[119:44.90]There was a movie about that.
[119:46.56]I got it.
[119:46.95]Yo, are we stacking?
[119:48.43]Vinny, I got it.
[119:49.07]Over here.
[119:50.68]What's up?
[119:51.57]Get on the roof.
[119:52.45]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[119:55.49]It's a puzzle, guys.
[119:57.10]I'm playing only up.
[119:59.13]Wait, how do you get on the roof?
[120:00.96]Is there a ladder?
[120:02.08]There's a truck out there.
[120:04.00]I see it.
[120:04.54]Okay.
[120:04.88]That's killing me.
[120:10.36]Okay, I'm gonna sell this ship.
[120:14.56]Oh, guys, our first gun.
[120:16.71]We get this.
[120:17.37]Green beans every day, that's right.
[120:21.22]Priorities are a little different with Jarma.
[120:23.44]He's excited about green beans.
[120:24.79]Polk's excited about guns.
[120:28.24]Military jacket, whoop.
[120:31.29]They're okay.
[120:32.12]No!
[120:32.20]No!
[120:33.93]Awww.
[120:41.36]Hoke, I think you dropped a dookie on the way down.
[120:43.90]Really?
[120:45.89]I don't know.
[120:46.21]I thought I saw like a dookie.
[120:51.69]Welcome home!
[120:57.34]Little parkour noob.
[121:00.20]Did you make it?
[121:02.87]No.
[121:05.64]I died the same way.
[121:07.23]Probably stupider.
[121:12.43]Nothing could be stupider.
[121:13.58]It was really dumb.
[121:16.42]I'm gonna leave that down here, actually.
[121:21.91]Okay, any more stuff to sell?
[121:24.87]I don't think so.
[121:26.09]Oh, the guitars.
[121:26.84]Can you sell the guitars?
[121:29.73]I'm not even sure you can sell the guitars, honestly.
[121:36.09]It's cool that our farming group has a dedicated salesman.
[121:41.85]I'm here.
[121:42.58]I'm ready.
[121:43.46]That's how you optimize and that's how you do it.
[121:49.52]I mean, you kind of need to have somebody do this.
[121:53.25]Otherwise, look what just happened.
[121:55.18]It was a mess.
[121:56.08]Nobody was looking at it.
[121:56.92]Everyone was just throwing stuff down, me included.
[122:01.77]That's why I get frustrated in a lot of games like this where I just don't do that and everything becomes a mess and then I'm like, I don't want to play anymore.
[122:11.12]That's why he didn't want to play high too.
[122:14.66]Yeah, my my yeah, my stuff is a mess.
[122:16.98]I mean, we could have started a new map though.
[122:21.08]I was down for Hytale, actually.
[122:22.49]I was.
[122:23.45]But we can do that.
[122:25.78]We can do that.
[122:27.01]Huh.
[122:27.35]I don't think you can sell this.
[122:29.14]Ended up a surprise.
[122:31.34]I'm getting it.
[122:35.65]Alright, is there anything that you guys that we need?
[122:37.70]Because I have money to spend.
[122:39.81]What do you think we need?
[122:42.37]Something that we need at the base.
[122:43.88]Wood, scrap, electronics, gasoline.
[122:46.03]What do you think?
[122:47.90]I think wood seems to be the thing that...
[122:50.53]Some wood at least.
[122:54.41]Okay, we'll say wood.
[122:55.53]What about Ster?
[122:56.01]What about you?
[122:57.90]What was the question?
[122:58.96]What do we want?
[123:00.25]Wood scrap?
[123:01.63]What do you what do we need?
[123:03.70]I have no idea what we need.
[123:05.23]I feel like we're self-sufficient and thriving and there's nothing new that I have seen where I'm at.
[123:11.76]Okay.
[123:11.84]I feel like I need for nothing.
[123:13.75]We have enough sausage to last us forever.
[123:16.34]So I'll save the money.

[124:33.83]Okay, we don't want to do that.
[124:42.00]Oh, this can be sold.

[140:58.22]Thank you for the raid.
[141:04.09]Hi, everyone.
[141:04.55]I appreciate it.
[141:06.73]You can wiggle if you want.
[141:10.51]I'm literally like 20 minutes away from ending my stream, but you know if you want to see some crazy shit You're in the right place
[141:21.59]This thing sucks.
[141:29.13]Can I sell these arms for money?
[141:32.54]Ow.
[141:34.05]OW!
[141:35.74]Fuck.
[141:38.23]I mean I guess it's radiation protection.
[141:41.15]Wait, how do we get new zones?
[141:42.23]Shines?
[141:44.93]What does that mean, shines?
[141:46.84]Super irradiated in here.
[141:48.40]This is not supposed to be armor.
[141:49.47]If you need radiation protection, I have it on the ground over here.
[141:53.12]Let's go hunt Vinny.
[141:56.86]Alright, this is the last day, right?
[141:58.75]Vinny, you said you wanted one more?
[142:00.87]Yeah, this is it.
[142:01.62]I need anti-radiation.
[142:03.30]Oh, my God.
[142:04.81]I got an anti-radiation suit.
[142:07.09]This world would be looking a little different than the other ones.
[142:15.24]This one's a little fucked.
[142:17.14]Jerma, that's outside.
[142:19.23]Do you need the anti-radiation suit?
[142:21.08]Radiation suit, yeah.

[142:29.14]I'm right near you.
[142:30.17]Oh, you're near me.
[142:31.07]I died.
[142:31.69]I already died.
[142:32.29]Yeah.

[142:42.62]Thank you.
[142:42.98]This world do be kind of fucked.
[142:46.59]Yeah, the bunker has a ton of ammo and grenades, but it's super irradiated.
[142:51.41]It's expensive as hell.
[142:52.83]200 bucks for ammo.
[142:54.80]Fiat.
[142:57.05]We do have a lot of ammo.
[142:58.48]Well, not really, but there's more out here.
[143:01.33]To sell my gun is 50 bucks.
[143:04.33]Yeah, no.
[143:07.21]Bro, the amount of work it took to get it.
[143:09.66]What?
[143:10.97]What happened to you?

[143:16.49]You gotta stop dying!

[143:29.99]Alright, I'm coming out.
[143:30.69]I'm coming out to...
[143:31.60]I want to adventure on this last day.
[143:35.01]This place sucks, Jerma.
[143:38.71]Maybe I should stay home.
[143:40.44]no I mean you can just avoid the radiation like I just might you can't every direction was already
[143:48.12]So maybe we should make more radiation stuff?
[143:51.26]Or there's anti-radiation tablets in the medical tent.
[143:57.50]Minus 30 radiation for one.
[144:00.94]Hey, man, this is your first time leaving the base.
[144:02.56]Do you need an escort?
[144:04.51]This is actually... Yeah, why don't you come with me?
[144:09.62]Hey, smartass, why don't you come with me?
[144:13.42]Yeah, hold on, I gotta eat.
[144:16.64]Die.
[144:19.07]Did it turn daytime, like, really quickly just now, chat?
[144:22.39]Yes.
[144:24.22]Oh.
[144:31.60]Gasoline.
[144:32.55]It's useful.
[144:33.43]What does that mean?
[144:34.08]The suit does not pick up.
[144:36.18]Whoa, that's creepy.
[144:37.07]Glad I didn't touch it.
[144:38.23]Much of anything.
[144:39.78]What the fuck?!
[144:40.78]!
[144:41.98]Did you get stabbed?
[144:44.52]One of these everlasting gobstopper things is attacking me.
[144:48.52]Yeah.
[144:54.61]I'm not regenerating stamina.
[144:56.71]Oh boy.
[144:58.92]Those are guys with guns.
[145:01.51]Guys with guns.
[145:03.65]Oh, I found your body Vinny.
[145:07.11]You can take anything, but you're going to die from radiation, so be careful.
[145:11.26]You can just take whatever's on there, if there's anything good.
[145:14.25]I don't know.
[145:15.02]The suit was the best part.
[145:17.08]Probably.
[145:17.60]I got it.
[145:22.28]Did I seriously take anti-radiation and I'm still dying?
[145:26.74]It's pretty rough out here.
[145:28.06]Oh, fuck.
[145:30.24]Dude, I'm dead immediately.
[145:32.75]Okay.
[145:35.29]I didn't think it was going to be that crazy.
[145:37.62]Oh, yeah, it's bad.
[145:38.62]It's bad out here.
[145:40.23]You chose the worst day to go adventuring.
[145:43.28]Oh, fuck.
[145:55.98]Huh.
[145:56.52]Soviet rig.
[145:57.40]If only there was a... Well, I knew there was radiation, but I figured I could take those tablets and at least live to pick up the stuff on his body.
[146:03.90]That's good.
[146:07.91]I guess you can't even go over there.
[146:10.22]Much carry capacity.
[146:11.24]Yeah, no, that's just Forsaken.
[146:15.95]Well, I need to bring a new weapon.
[146:17.28]picked up some good inventory there's like stuff you can wear on your like sides that give you inventory space where where is the healing
[146:27.03]It's all been eaten.
[146:29.59]Oh, no.
[146:30.96]I mean, we could go sell and buy it.
[146:32.73]I mean, just sell a bunch of junk.
[146:34.40]No, no, no.
[146:35.40]Last day.
[146:36.24]No, no, no.
[146:40.28]What's this voice?
[146:41.18]Is that the end of the stream voice?
[146:46.21]Is that your... No, it's the last day.
[146:49.10]I'm done.
[146:50.27]Ooh, ammo.
[146:59.06]Pickles.
[147:07.43]If I see something that moves, I'm shooting it.
[147:13.03]Alright.
[147:13.35]Where are you guys at?
[147:14.62]Because the radiation place is terrifying.
[147:17.02]I'm tagging.
[147:17.40]I'm tagging.
[147:24.05]I found another underground area, it looks like.
[147:27.61]Yeah, take damage.
[147:33.79]There's a hole in the ground.
[147:36.52]What is going on in this bunker?
[147:42.38]Whoa.
[147:43.63]Oh my god.
[147:44.54]Is that a- is that a player?
[147:47.07]No, it's me.
[147:47.75]Oh, hey!
[147:50.28]It's you.
[147:50.56]Jerma, getting out of here is gonna suck.
[147:51.69]Is it gonna suck?
[147:53.00]Yeah, I'm in Tarkov looting mode right now.
[147:54.98]I'm going crazy.
[147:56.21]How are we gonna get out?
[147:57.18]Oh shit, I got the drill.
[148:02.43]Just run through, take damage.
[148:04.00]I don't know.
[148:05.88]You're going to the corner was awesome, by the way.
[148:08.16]Alright.
[148:08.52]I don't know why I did that.
[148:09.45]I don't know why I did that.
[148:14.30]I did try to stab you twice, by the way.
[148:17.49]No, I'm not watching any video in the background.
[148:18.92]I'm just locked in.
[148:23.40]This is worse.
[148:24.65]What is going on?
[148:27.00]These people that are in stasis?
[148:29.98]Who's this fucking monster?
[148:31.52]Apparently environmental storytelling.
[148:34.21]I'm dead.
[148:35.11]The guy, okay, there was a monster man out there and I got killed in two hits.
[148:44.92]What are you doing?
[148:52.03]What are you shooting?
[148:52.95]There's a swamp.
[148:54.45]Whatever killed it's not moving.
[148:56.86]Oh, oh, I'm just going to get my body.
[148:59.77]I feel like it's distinct.
[149:01.09]Oh, I just ate its arm.
[149:02.74]It's standing up dead.
[149:03.86]I'm out of ammo then.
[149:05.62]Weird.
[149:07.06]Jerma, come to the ping.
[149:09.86]Come to the ping for your, uh, your body.
[149:13.79]Coming.
[149:15.61]Maybe stick to the housework?
[149:17.06]I feel like maybe I should.
[149:21.03]What?
[149:23.96]Uh, ping again, Vinny, if you can?
[149:26.78]Yeah.
[149:27.50]Thank you.
[149:28.69]Oh my god, I walked out, there's radiation everywhere here.
[149:30.75]I...
[149:31.78]Wait, what?
[149:32.95]Okay.
[149:33.03]I thought... Oh my god, I'm dead again.
[149:37.84]I mean, you didn't have much.
[149:39.34]I could bring it to you.
[149:40.43]I'm just gonna go pick up the fucking living room, okay?
[149:43.64]Okay.
[149:44.87]What's that?
[149:45.43]What's that noise?
[149:46.99]There's a noise.
[149:49.14]No, it's me.
[149:49.56]It's just fake dead people.
[149:51.89]No, we killed a bunch of people here.
[149:53.63]Yeah, it's a bug.
[149:55.78]Oh.
[149:57.73]Yeah, fake dead people.
[149:58.51]I didn't mean to.
[150:00.98]I'm dead.
[150:01.79]It's over.
[150:03.81]Is it the radiation?
[150:04.79]You need heals?
[150:10.39]Um... Not really.
[150:17.56]Do we have anything to sell?
[150:18.79]The suitcase is kind of crazy.
[150:23.72]I lost track of Jerma's body already.
[150:25.99]I don't even fucking know where it is.
[150:27.12]I had pretty much nothing.
[150:29.44]Yeah.
[150:29.81]No, you had a good jacket.
[150:31.21]I'm going to lose all my gear by dying in a weird spot.
[150:32.76]This game, I'm... Guys.
[150:34.73]It was a fun night, guys.
[150:35.75]What are you doing?
[150:37.98]Why are you killing me?
[150:38.84]I'm tired.
[150:39.80]Did you die in a weird spot?
[150:41.91]Yeah, really bad.
[150:42.68]Who just stabbed me in the head?
[150:44.73]What?
[150:44.81]Okay, you camper.
[150:47.30]You fucking camper.
[150:48.93]You wanna...
[150:52.12]I don't want to get down there, and I also don't have any anti... Get out, he's camping me.
[150:57.01]Hey, hey, where are you going?
[150:59.30]I gotta fucking fight back.
[151:00.59]This is a fun game.
[151:01.39]I liked it.
[151:04.20]It's interesting.
[151:08.21]When Poke says something's interesting,
[151:10.82]He means it.
[151:12.89]I think it is fun, too.
[151:14.10]I feel like I picked a bad day to come out of the base, though.
[151:21.57]Yeah, this is by far the worst day.
[151:24.33]We haven't had, like, radiation everywhere like this.
[151:27.43]We've been having fun.
[151:28.71]Gentlemen rules, please.
[151:30.12]Gentlemen rules.
[151:30.74]I want a weapon, and we can do gentlemen rules fight.
[151:34.81]I don't think they're friendly.
[151:37.70]Gentlemen's rules.
[151:41.73]Come on out.
[151:44.02]Uh-oh.
[151:45.56]Okay.
[151:46.65]I'm at half health.
[151:47.85]So am I. I can't find it.
[151:52.15]Get that jacket off.
[151:54.61]Hey, don't charge me while I'm taking my clothes off.
[152:04.07]Get that hat off too!
[152:08.01]Alright.
[152:09.46]Come over here.
[152:10.02]Wait, there is friendly fire?
[152:12.21]One bottle of vodka, we both drink it at the same time and then we go for it.
[152:20.65]Alright, you ready?
[152:22.65]Hold it in your hand.
[152:25.77]Oh, I just drank it already.
[152:27.56]Let's go.
[152:31.68]Alright, let's go.
[152:33.19]360.
[152:40.90]You got to get the momentum built up.
[152:50.46]What the fuck, dude?
[152:51.79]How?
[152:53.74]Holy shit.
[152:55.83]All that.
[152:56.07]How did you survive?
[152:57.07]I'm just built different.
[153:00.82]You remember in Crime Simulator?
[153:02.11]I read the strong book.
[153:06.33]I... did you...
[153:10.12]Pretty funny.
[153:11.05]This was fun.
[153:12.03]I like this game.
[153:12.68]It's fun.
[153:13.64]Yeah, it was good.
[153:14.97]Some good looting and shooting.
[153:16.72]Looting and shooting.
[153:18.36]Barely any shooting, honestly, but still enjoyable until this last map where it got a little ridiculous.
[153:26.46]Alright, we all have to pick up a guitar.
[153:27.56]Everyone pick a guitar up and play a song.
[153:29.91]Oh man, this is cute.
[153:32.80]This'll be cute.
[153:33.52]Come on.
[153:39.23]I really do like the nuclear bomb resetting though.
[153:45.96]It's required for these.
[153:48.85]aims to have a well integrated acoustic guitar.
[153:57.53]Are you playing a guitar?
[153:59.48]Now I am.
[154:00.93]The flies on our corpses are louder.
[154:03.84]Oh, God, it's so dissonant.
[154:05.97]Come here.
[154:12.21]Three, two, one, go.
[154:21.50]Nice.
[154:27.19]We're killing it.
[154:28.35]So beautiful.
[154:38.06]I knew it wasn't going to do all of them.
[154:41.78]Do you have like 10 plus points in Disgranked or something?
[154:45.16]I have no gear on.
[154:47.39]How do you always get one shot?
[154:48.91]Am I dying in one?
[154:49.79]Am I just weak?
[154:50.94]Do I need more nutrition?
[154:54.97]Alright, alright, alright.
[154:58.85]That was fun!
[155:00.01]Guys, I'm glad we got a chance to hang a little bit because it had been too long.
[155:03.91]That was gracious.
[155:05.08]Alright, Hytale next time or Minecraft Horror?
[155:09.39]I'm down for either one of those.
[155:10.38]They both sound great.
[155:11.89]I'm good for either two.
[155:14.67]Hytale, like I said, it's getting pretty consistent updates.
[155:20.43]So...
[155:21.88]Ooh.
[155:22.95]Nah, no.
[155:23.49]Terraria's too... You guys see that Terraria update coming out?
[155:25.58]Dude.
[155:25.80]Oh, man.
[155:26.40]Terraria.
[155:27.44]That would be a problem if we did Terraria, but I'm down.
[155:31.38]I'm down.
[155:32.17]I mean, that's the 24 seven, three days a week stream.
[155:36.15]No.
[155:36.66]Yeah.
[155:37.02]Now that that's gonna be fully my first dreams ever in my life was a 24-hour to draw a stream the ship was absolute dog I Don't give a fuck
[155:46.98]It was so hard.
[155:51.22]Oh man, I remember.
[155:52.73]Alright, love you guys.
[155:54.05]Alright, you too, Poke.
[155:55.53]Have a good night, everyone.
[155:56.52]Have a great day.
[155:57.68]See you later.
[155:58.60]Thanks for playing.
[155:59.13]Good luck with the storms and the cold and stuff.
[156:01.47]Yeah, actually, be careful.
[156:03.26]Yeah.
[156:03.48]I'll try.
[156:05.34]No.
[156:07.22]Alright, bye.
[156:12.68]Bye.
[156:14.19]Bye.
[156:15.21]Bye.
[156:17.03]This Monday.
[156:20.68]I it's funny, I spent the last like hour and 10 minutes of what we just did.
[156:27.54]cleaning up the base and then we're done.
[156:35.29]It's like, I got my recyclables here, my glass, my plastic.
[156:37.74]And then over here is the metal and the tape and uninstall the game.
[156:44.25]And then the day that I'm going to go out is the day that they're like, actually, this sucks.
[156:48.06]This is the worst time to go out.
[156:50.46]It's all irradiated.
[156:56.54]It was fun though.
[156:56.98]I liked that game.
[156:58.07]I liked both things we did.
[156:59.55]We had fun.
[157:01.83]Uh, so let me explain something very quickly.
[157:05.95]Uh, I was trying to play the movies.
[157:09.92]That was what I was planning on doing.
[157:13.06]I don't think I'm gonna be able to do that tomorrow.
[157:15.58]So... Let me see if I can get some shit done.
[157:20.75]Let me actually try to get the movies to work.
[157:26.23]because it's not going to be ready tomorrow.
[157:29.22]If I cannot figure this out in the next 24 hours, then I'm gonna have to get, like I said in the beginning of the stream,
[157:37.71]just go for an old computer.
[157:44.38]Because I'll try the virtual machine.
[157:45.62]I'll see if I can get it to work.
[157:54.77]But like I said, we may need to move the Casino Inc. and
[157:59.77]the movie streams till after I get this Windows XP computer to natively play it.
[158:08.32]if I can't get it to work and I've been trying to get it to work on Windows 11 and it sucks absolute ass.
[158:14.13]It's almost impossible to get this thing to work.
[158:15.98]Casino Inc. opens and works, but has issues.
[158:21.06]and the movies has problems too it just needs a lot of random community patches and uh it seems like I ran into an issue with it already so
[158:34.36]But keep an eye out.
[158:35.81]I'm going to say let me...
[158:38.40]I might stream tomorrow.
[158:40.99]It's not going to be the movies or Casino Inc.
[158:44.46]If not, then it'll be very, very early in the week, either Monday or Tuesday.
[158:50.80]But just keep an eye on the sus.
[158:52.00]It's going to be vague for the next day or two.
