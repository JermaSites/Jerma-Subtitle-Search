[ve:60.16.100]

[00:13.46]Hold on a second, I made it.
[00:21.98]I thought this shit wasn't starting for like another 20 minutes.
[00:25.29]There are reveals going on right now.
[00:29.83]I also have no idea where Ster is.
[00:33.41]I think Ster POE2'd himself.
[00:36.71]Uh... asleep.
[00:40.31]So you just got me today.
[00:43.08]Alright, and what are they revealed so far?
[00:44.96]Anything good?
[00:46.16]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[00:51.37]Turn the delay of the microphone off.
[00:53.15]Alright, what do we got?
[00:55.37]What's up?
[00:55.75]How are you doing?
[00:57.53]Slay the Spire 2?
[01:00.48]No way!
[01:06.58]It's still technically the previews.
[01:08.94]It's alright.
[01:17.85]Are you in a cave?
[01:19.59]Hey, who gives a fuck where I am, alright?
[01:23.34]I'm in a comfortable place, in a very comfortable position, watching the Game Awards.
[01:31.46]And my co-host for the evening is not here.
[01:33.84]Nice buzz cut, yeah.
[01:34.72]It showcases thought-provoking games with
[01:45.27]You have the webcam.
[01:46.07]The webcam's on.
[01:47.07]Yeah, you get up to five minutes of that the whole night.
[01:53.25]Up to five minutes.
[01:54.96]You're so late.
[01:55.72]There was a countdown in the top right corner when this started.
[02:00.94]It said 29 minutes.
[02:02.14]Never.
[02:02.34]Never.
[02:12.51]I played three games in 2024.
[02:14.69]Who even cares?
[02:15.78]What are you even doing here?
[02:18.54]Well, it is such an honor to receive this award.
[02:22.62]Well, first, I would like to thank the jury and basically everyone who voted for us.
[02:27.80]This award belongs to the entire team at Nomad Studio.
[02:31.37]Where is Elden Ring?
[02:32.47]Our friends and family and basically everyone who helped us to bring Neva to life.
[02:37.89]I would like to thank, as well, Devolver Digital.
[02:40.39]They were the first one.
[02:41.69]They believed in us since the beginning, and they gave us the opportunity to play two wonderful games.
[02:46.50]I'm looking forward to making many more in the future.
[02:49.30]And finally, I would like to thank the players.
[02:52.30]It's amazing to see how our story resonates with them.
[02:54.78]And we'd love to see how they enjoy our games, so thank you so much.
[03:00.17]Yeah, this is going to periodically turn on every time.
[03:02.87]And now, another cozy game, and to introduce it is someone who knows a thing or two about them.
[03:08.51]Cozy game?
[03:11.43]Thanks, Sydney.
[03:12.47]Hey, Game Awards.
[03:13.69]I'm really excited to share one of my most anticipated cozy games with you.
[03:19.45]Tales of the Shire.
[03:20.25]Dude, that should be a category.
[03:21.93]Coziest game of the year.
[03:23.09]There's so much to Marvel at in the Shire.
[03:25.11]A game that you drink a hot chocolate to and play?
[03:27.25]Well, Stardew would win every single year.
[03:29.88]I love spending endless hours in my IRL garden, and this game captures that feeling so well. ...
[03:37.83]I haven't looked at the screen once.
[03:40.33]I think I did for five seconds.
[03:42.41]I need to pay attention to what's going on, not the chat.
[03:45.47]I'm the worst fucking co-streamer ever.
[03:59.39]I'm so sorry, anybody.
[04:00.33]I thought they were getting a real one.
[04:01.25]Wait, Tales of the Shire?
[04:01.89]I don't even follow the game.
[04:02.51]Oh, dude, wait.
[04:02.77]Boar versus what?
[04:03.31]Oh, I thought it was like an ant.
[04:04.97]Okay, never mind.
[04:05.79]Wait, wild hound?
[04:31.22]versus behemoth well this looks interesting I wonder what this one is yeah what's up I I'm just getting right into it I'm just watching
[04:57.46]I thought I was... I did not mean to be this late.
[05:00.36]I really didn't think it was going to start until like 10, 20 minutes from now.
[05:09.93]Stalcraft.
[05:12.66]Stalcraft.
[05:14.72]That looks like... Okay.
[05:23.11]For a second I felt like I just couldn't read that.
[05:25.23]Yes!
[05:25.65]Acted in-game dialog.
[05:51.00]Came in from behind.
[05:53.86]Double kills?
[06:00.53]Wait, is this fake in-game dialog?
[06:04.77]I think this is real fake in-game dialog.
[06:09.13]Is it?
[06:15.32]I think that was actually just like streamers or YouTubers.
[06:18.82]I don't think that was fake.
[06:21.53]That was people actually enjoying their time.
[06:23.71]We are so close to the big show.
[06:26.19]It's not even out yet.
[06:27.95]Thank you so much.
[06:28.63]I love you too.
[06:29.35]You guys said it was late.
[06:31.03]Which, by the way, is freaking stacked this year.
[06:33.69]Let's hear it for the 10th anniversary of the Game Awards.
[06:42.06]But until then, enough.
[06:44.72]I'm kidding.
[06:45.12]I still have some incredible awards and world premieres to share with you.
[06:49.49]So let's get back into it with our next award, Innovation in Accessibility.
[06:55.29]These nominees have all made strides to make their games as playable as possible by as many gamers as possible.
[07:01.91]So many people just came to the stream because I turned the cam on for the first time in like 10 minutes.
[07:06.93]Everybody freaked out.
[07:09.99]Dragon Age, the Veil Guard.
[07:11.51]You see the power that I have?
[07:13.21]You see the power that I have over you?
[07:16.43]Just a mere image of my likeness is able to shrink you down.
[07:23.40]Prince of Persia, the Lost Crown.
[07:29.92]He looks evil.
[07:31.22]Good to see you.
[07:31.72]Yeah, I'm feeling a little better.
[07:33.48]Very slowly, it's gone from terrible to bad to okay.
[07:35.64]I'd say I'm in the okay stage right now.
[07:37.28]Got some tea here, I'm good.
[07:59.49]It was a passion project made by an incredible team.
[08:03.27]Big congratulations to the team.
[08:05.55]I know you're watching from Montpellier.
[08:07.25]Félicitations, l'équipe.
[08:08.80]And a warm thank you.
[08:09.84]Who had on their bingo card?
[08:11.82]Jerma is late to the stream.
[08:14.38]Right?
[08:14.56]Like, oh my god, I'm like...
[08:17.82]I just got here.
[08:18.54]Sorry.
[08:19.00]Like, here I am.
[08:20.33]And we're on Ster's stream too.
[08:22.83]You never thought you could have flipped it.
[08:24.99]Ster's the one that's not here.
[08:26.21]And in 40 minutes, he's going to be like, he's going to call me and be like, what the fuck?
[08:32.39]We Freaky Friday'd or something because I'm doing the you.
[08:34.64]He's doing the me, right?
[08:36.30]Because he's not here.
[08:40.14]That's usually me.
[08:42.26]Alright.
[08:42.88]Actually, the core keeper was fun.
[08:47.15]I enjoyed Corekeeper.
[09:04.30]Dude, what is it with humans and our need to simulate digging through the Earth?
[09:15.24]We just want to see it all.
[09:17.20]We're just explorers at heart.
[09:25.22]We just want to know what's down there.
[09:30.74]What the hell was that?
[09:37.58]Love it.
[09:38.18]And that is the perfect way to get into our next award.
[09:42.38]Best Family Game.
[09:43.92]Oh, Best Family Game.
[09:45.40]I can tell you this one.
[09:46.56]Astro Bot.
[09:50.70]Princess Peach Showtime.
[09:52.60]Okay, Astro Bot is... Super Mario Party Jamboree.
[09:58.17]The Legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom.
[10:02.39]And The Plucky Squire.
[10:03.83]Wow, a lot of us are excited about Best Family Game.
[10:08.69]The Game Award goes to...
[10:12.36]I thought Astro Bot was like a controller demo for PS5 to show you how the rumble feature worked.
[10:26.56]we've been working hard on for many, many years at Team Asobi.
[10:29.29]So first thing, I want to thank Team Asobi.
[10:31.73]Over in Japan, all 65 of you, thank you so much.
[10:34.83]It's your heart and soul that went into this game, really trying to please and put smiles on people's faces.
[10:39.99]So this is really for you.
[10:41.49]Thank you so much.
[10:42.91]Making a family game is important because it's reforming the first gaming memories of people.
[10:48.07]They all have first gaming memories, right?
[10:50.31]That's fucking awesome.
[10:50.97]So it's both a privilege, big responsibility as well, but it's one we take very much at heart.
[10:56.23]So this award, you know, it's for the kids and the parents out there.
[10:58.67]We love you very much.
[10:59.43]Thank you very much.
[11:00.22]Hey, you know what?
[11:00.96]Good on them.
[11:02.40]Good on them.
[11:02.78]High quality, younger, E for Everyone Entertainment stuff.
[11:06.74]We need more of it.
[11:08.56]Good for them.
[11:09.08]Let's hope they keep making cool stuff.
[11:13.58]What is it?
[11:14.40]Huh?
[11:43.62]I just got... Ster is typing, by the way.
[11:45.40]Wait, is this a soccer game?
[11:47.74]Mega Man Soccer?
[11:50.74]Still looks kind of cool.
[11:53.18]Ster is here.
[11:54.17]He said, sorry, I was asleep.
[11:55.65]Whoops, LOL.
[11:57.35]We Freaky Friday.
[12:07.85]I'm just saying, I'm live.
[12:08.89]You call me when ready.
[12:22.04]I, okay, I don't really, I'm not a big fan of football or soccer, but I actually really do like arcade soccer video games.
[12:31.67]I actually really like them.
[12:33.35]I don't like simulation soccer.
[12:34.73]I like arcade soccer.
[12:35.99]Two.
[13:04.94]Lightning.
[13:05.60]Not thousands.
[13:15.76]Millions!
[13:25.85]Whoa!
[13:26.87]I need my co-host.
[13:30.41]I need my co-host.
[13:31.57]I have a very, very obvious.
[13:33.57]I need my co-host.
[13:38.77]Hey, what's up?
[13:43.43]I can't hear you.
[13:47.63]I don't think you're coming through correctly.
[13:53.36]Why are you so much lower in the game?
[14:05.46]You are as high as I can possibly make you.
[14:15.79]Wait, it might be a me thing.
[14:16.87]Hold on.
[14:18.35]Is it a me thing?
[14:18.87]That was the announcement of the last two from the Paris-based Tactical Adventures.
[14:31.30]Alright, my friends.
[14:33.72]Hey, we're at the preview still.
[14:34.88]It's fine.
[14:35.10]I did not hear what you said.
[14:36.06]Let me fix this.
[14:36.74]Hold on.
[14:37.20]Wait, we haven't even started yet.
[14:57.58]This is a Game Awards you definitely do not want to miss.
[15:01.26]Alright.
[15:02.16]The countdown is over.
[15:04.23]The 2024 Game Awards starts now.
[15:09.41]Why can I not hear you?
[15:10.33]Are you boosted?
[15:11.03]Are you doing something weird?
[15:12.39]Welcome to the Game Awards 2024.
[15:13.15]Now, here's your host, creator of the Game Awards, Jeff Keighley.
[15:25.36]Why are you so late?
[15:26.80]I have you like a million percent on Discord.
[15:32.75]I don't know.
[15:33.51]This is fairly, this is pretty new.
[15:36.69]Good evening, everybody.
[15:38.19]I know, but nobody can see.
[15:41.34]Nobody can hear you.
[15:42.42]Welcome to the Game Awards, the biggest global celebration of video games out there.
[15:47.66]And you have joined us.
[15:49.66]Can you guys hear him?
[15:50.88]Our 10th anniversary.
[15:52.53]Welcome.
[15:58.56]You know, when we started TGA in 2014, we had no idea it would become as big as it is.
[16:03.73]I mean, you're just really low.
[16:05.59]Like so many of you, that games and the people who make them and the fans deserve a moment like this.
[16:11.63]You watch this show.
[16:12.39]What happens if you boost?
[16:13.19]Because games are part of your identity.
[16:15.39]They mean something to you.
[16:16.63]And tonight is a tribute to just how far games have come.
[16:21.21]And despite the challenges our industry faces, where they are going in the future.
[16:25.06]This is why you gotta get popcorn and drinks and soda before the movie.
[16:27.88]So what the fuck is going on?
[16:53.58]I promise you it's not.
[16:54.40]Hold on a second.
[16:54.96]Can you say a couple things?
[17:24.44]Let me recall you.
[17:25.46]Yeah, I don't know why he's doing this.
[17:26.90]You guys, just watch the Game Awards while I figure out how to make him louder.
[17:43.11]And finally, we announced his studio at the first TGA, and in 2021, he won Game of the Year.
[17:50.58]And tonight, despite our better judgment, he's going to have the stage all to himself to reveal his next game a little bit later.
[17:58.47]Joseph Fares, welcome back, buddy.

[19:08.25]Alright, well, in any case.
[19:10.10]Oh, we got another D4 bad.
[19:12.56]and to present tonight's first award, I couldn't think of a better duo.
[19:16.50]He's one of our industry's greatest creative forces alongside one of our most talented performers.
[19:24.79]We can't hear you, dude.
[19:25.91]What is going on?
[19:31.51]This is why you show up at the fucking previews.
[19:35.77]This is why you show up to the preview.
[19:37.39]I was sitting there waiting in the movie theater alone.
[19:42.69]Alright, we can we watch this?
[19:43.77]We need to watch the game awards.
[19:46.47]Watch it.
[19:46.96]Oh, no.
[19:47.30]Okay.
[19:47.56]Some of my peers, my friends like Nolan North, Roger Clark, voice actors, Laura Bailey.
[19:51.28]Actually, Troy, have you ever won this award?
[20:10.57]Nobody tell him.
[20:11.39]Nobody tell him that his voice is... What?
[20:16.71]Just talk.
[20:18.93]Just talk.
[20:19.55]I'm trying.
[20:21.16]Oh, maybe not.
[20:21.66]I thought your voice was still pitched down.
[20:23.50]It could be.
[20:29.32]It could be anybody you want me to be.
[20:30.90]Is this best voice acting in a game?
[20:34.14]Okay, did you... Wait, hold on.
[20:35.56]They're doing something here.
[20:43.23]What the fuck is Joe Biden doing here?
[20:47.52]Harrison Ford is fucking in the building.
[21:01.78]Wow.
[21:03.12]Wow.
[21:06.58]Thank you.
[21:07.26]My eyes hurt.
[21:07.92]Thank you.
[21:08.86]You think he's ever played a video game?
[21:12.08]Watch him give like a time completion of this game.
[21:14.52]Let's give a big round of applause to these two guys.
[21:16.78]Why is it?
[21:18.19]Let me tell you, new game plus is way too hard.
[21:20.85]Pizza party, pizza man.
[21:22.83]Where's pizza man?
[21:26.71]What?
[21:27.79]He likes Pizza Tower.
[21:28.71]Oh, oh.
[21:29.97]He starts, I don't remember.
[21:33.17]Why is there one with the guy with the pizzas?
[21:34.23]If I'd known he was so good.
[21:36.77]Luigi.
[21:37.45]I would have done it myself.
[21:41.75]was he did he do any work on this game like any like like mocap or like voice actor or anything is he like a character and now it'd be real weird if he wasn't and he's here here to present the award for best performance here are the nominees best performance wow just look at it all
[22:05.57]Final Fantasy seven.

[22:10.35]Like the strange.
[22:11.45]Okay.
[22:11.95]This job.
[22:13.85]It's a Star Wars.
[22:15.89]I'm going to finish.
[22:16.47]Why don't they show a game?
[22:17.49]Someone's played.
[22:18.17]So we know if the acting and it's good.
[22:19.61]Oh, here we go.
[22:20.11]Silent Hill.
[22:21.09]Did you play this?
[22:22.39]No.
[22:22.79]The shadow will always hang over me.
[22:25.17]Okay.
[22:25.51]Well, then your argument makes it absolutely no sound.
[22:28.31]I haven't played any of those.
[22:31.79]And the winner is.
[22:34.18]Melinda Jurgens.
[22:40.83]Guy.
[22:43.45]I feel like like voice acting in the game like as an award category.
[22:47.33]You really gotta fucking bring it.
[22:48.55]Oh, that's cool that they do it.
[22:52.73]Also new is like the whole game.
[22:55.62]Is is acting yeah?
[22:59.74]Which I still.
[23:03.14]I either want to play it or watch it.
[23:04.80]It looked really cool in all the trailers.
[23:06.72]I keep hearing that it's cool.
[23:07.86]It's good.
[23:08.22]There's two of them, right?
[23:10.45]There is indeed a second one.
[23:17.23]She just won an award for it.
[23:18.21]Turn up the volume.
[23:18.79]Better?
[23:19.07]She said, finally, finally.
[23:19.71]Can you believe it's been 10 years?
[23:46.28]I've been doing this for 10 years of this.
[23:50.43]Why does it feel like three?
[23:52.35]It feels like I'm just getting older.
[23:53.73]Yeah, it feels like year three.
[23:56.56]I agree.
[23:58.59]How does that one guy... I don't know.
[24:04.14]Everybody they bring up here, how do they make a new game every year?
[24:07.02]How do they make so many things?
[24:09.98]How do we make so many things as humans that we can do award shows about all the best ones we made that year, not that decade?
[24:28.49]Can we turn the smoke up, please?
[24:29.88]Is that the name of the game?
[24:31.84]That's a cool name for a game.
[24:58.82]Cinematic curly pre-rendered in Unreal Engine 5 on an unannounced NVIDIA GeForce GPU.
[25:04.22]That's important.
[25:04.84]Uh oh.
[25:05.08]I was gonna say someone is naked.
[25:07.91]This is The Witcher.
[25:25.87]That's like the opening.
[25:27.33]Someone is naked in the beginning of every Witcher game.
[25:30.56]All of them?
[25:31.64]All three of them?
[25:32.24]Even Netflix.
[25:33.62]Even on the Netflix one?
[25:34.22]Someone's in a bathtub at the beginning of every single one.
[25:37.12]And it's always just really orange too, isn't it?
[25:53.00]It's like an orange lit room with a bathtub.
[25:56.21]yeah yeah it's gonna be like Batman arkham asylum fucking controls watch this forgive me daughter twere my only choice we shall
[26:25.93]I shall be the bringer of salvation.
[26:28.01]Don't +2 that.
[26:28.91]That wasn't even a joke.
[26:29.69]That was just a fucking thought.
[26:31.03]That was a thought bubble.
[26:32.35]A witcher?
[26:34.58]Witcher!
[26:35.36]Whose coin did you take?
[26:39.34]Nay, nay, you can't.
[26:41.34]You're not allowed to laugh at something if Jerma's thought about it beforehand.
[26:44.72]No!
[26:47.96]You chose her.
[26:53.27]Or whatever you say, witcher.
[27:00.55]Why are they like showing this one?
[27:01.69]This is coming out in like 2032.
[27:07.50]I've never played a Witcher game past like the main menu in one of them and then maybe like the first quest or two.
[27:17.14]Like I got a lot to look forward to.
[27:25.45]Run!
[28:03.66]I wouldn't feel comfortable with just a sword.
[28:04.96]I don't know how people spec into it.
[28:08.36]Yeah, like cast a spell or something.
[28:10.94]Do a sign.
[28:12.70]Yeah, like I want to be able to cast like a firestorm.
[28:18.42]A blade in your hand?
[28:20.04]No, thank you.
[28:22.03]It's not enough.
[28:26.55]Yeah, if I was fighting The Witcher, I wouldn't let them drink their grape juice.
[28:32.93]I feel like by this point, the monsters need to know.
[28:35.61]If they drink it, they're done.
[28:47.64]Magic is just so much better.
[28:48.78]And I don't want to hear this bullshit of like, well... What?
[28:52.72]Well, you would say that because he went to fucking wizard school for five years.
[28:57.25]Everyone's talking about his degree all the time.
[29:00.09]Oh, I went to Harvard.
[29:01.35]I learned how to cast fireball when I was 22.
[29:04.41]Can I ask you something?
[29:05.73]This is an important question.
[29:06.57]We'll talk in a second about it.
[29:09.84]Do you think that like what's the most badass thing that could ever happen?
[29:13.04]Like what's the most badass way you could ever die?
[29:16.10]It's guide to a wizard.
[29:19.30]What's the story with that one, right?
[29:20.66]Like, if you died to a wizard, that's gotta be the most badass way to go.
[29:23.18]Doesn't matter what happened.
[29:23.86]Doesn't matter if it's a traffic dispute or anything.
[29:27.54]Dying to a wizard is the most fucking crazy way to go.
[29:29.92]Like, why is a wizard after you?
[29:32.31]What beef did you have?
[29:35.25]It really depends on the spell, though.
[29:37.11]Which spell.
[29:38.55]It doesn't matter.
[29:39.13]If you got lightning bolted by a wizard, I feel like it hits harder than Polly more into a chicken.
[29:45.22]I don't think it matters.
[29:45.86]I think dying to a wizard means you had some fucking crazy shit going on in your life.
[29:49.20]No, no, I'm saying like if he polymorphs you and then does it, it's, it's, he ruins it.
[29:58.18]That doesn't matter.
[29:58.74]I think it does.
[30:00.32]He could humiliate you.
[30:03.48]On the gravestone, it's not going to say you, it just says, you know, here lies Jerma985.
[30:06.97]Died to a wizard.
[30:08.27]Died as a chicken.
[30:08.89]No.
[30:11.64]you can't say died as a chicken and that's to say like he had to use meteor storm his biggest spell for this he had to conjure the cataclysm I think just I don't think it matters if it's like he used he used mana siphon on you somebody said shut up this is cool wrong stream
[30:43.95]I don't think it matters though.
[30:44.85]If a wizard kills you with a fireball or a wizard like hits you with a car in traffic, you still died to a wizard.
[30:54.03]What if he wasn't wearing his robe?
[30:56.55]by the guy, uh, huh.
[30:58.65]What if he's in his, like, uh, well, I don't want to say pajamas.
[31:01.85]I feel like a wizard still feels very wizardly in the pajamas.
[31:06.49]Like, if their pajamas are blue and has, like, golden stars on it, it's basically a robe.
[31:10.22]Alright, hold this for the podcast.
[31:11.20]What?
[31:24.14]Please, please watch.
[31:26.10]Okay, well, we have to now.
[31:33.67]Wait, what?
[31:34.39]What is this?
[31:34.95]What is this?
[31:35.33]I'm serious.
[31:35.91]What is this?
[31:36.43]This is fucking Elden Ring.
[31:38.54]Is this Elden Ring?
[31:39.20]I don't know.
[31:42.98]Is it Elden Ring?
[31:46.64]Could you just please watch?
[31:48.10]I'm watching.
[31:55.99]Second DLC.
[31:57.51]Second DLC for Elden Ring.
[31:58.79]Are you shitting me?
[31:59.45]You're actually fucking kidding?
[32:07.88]It's a battle.
[32:08.42]Wait, was it a battle royale?
[32:10.96]The circle's coming in.
[32:13.94]Oh, dude, I didn't think I was going to give a shit about anything at this game awards.
[32:17.38]I'm here and I'm glued into my seat and I can't.
[32:20.01]Yo, we dropping Limgrave?
[32:23.23]Oh no.
[32:23.53]Shh, quiet.
[32:23.89]What the fuck is that thing?
[32:53.58]You could be a bird.
[32:54.28]You could be a bird in this Elden Ring DLC.
[33:05.73]Tragedy must be averted.
[33:12.59]And for that, I need your help.
[33:25.21]Stand tall.
[33:25.55]The night is far from over.
[33:31.53]What the fuck, dude?
[33:33.04]Are you kidding me?
[33:35.06]I'm actually like hogging in real life Batchester right now.
[33:37.84]A little pillager bent on sacking the lands of gold.
[33:47.76]I will swat away any and all who dare approach me.
[33:55.35]Is this just like a... We put like every boss ever in a game in like a mode or something?
[34:15.90]You gotta be kidding me, man.
[34:16.92]That's fucking awesome.
[34:17.88]I thought we were done.
[34:19.30]This is probably my favorite game of all time at this point.
[34:21.56]I actually thought it was just over.
[34:23.40]We got the DLC and that's it.
[34:25.31]we we canonically chose ronnie good choice wow that's ridiculous now you know why I was so excited there you have it Elden Ring night raid is a new co-op action adventure game from Bandai Namco entertainment and FromSoftware the uh only studio that's won game of the year twice at the game awards and it is coming next year 2025.
[34:51.32]next year even is more surprising that's awesome I'm like shocked damn alright yeah why doesn't he just run that trailer again I feel like I was so worried it was actually a battle royale at the beginning that's really cool I'm really excited about that whatever it is
[35:22.44]So it's like set in the Elden Ring universe.
[35:24.96]I don't, it's not like a DLC.
[35:26.26]It's like an Elden Ring new game.
[35:28.93]That's, I'm very curious about more info on that.
[35:41.23]We made so many jokes over the years.
[35:42.65]It's been 10 years of this.
[35:44.22]Of like, oh my God, FromSoftware, a new thing is going to be announced.
[35:46.46]And it never really does, especially with Elden Ring.
[35:49.63]I don't care about anything else.
[35:52.09]I could literally just leave.
[35:54.41]I could just turn the stream off right now and I'd be fine.
[35:57.45]Yeah, what do you think they're cooking if they put that at the beginning of the awards?
[36:02.49]Okay, I keep hearing this game is good.
[36:04.82]Like I hear this is a fun game.
[36:06.94]Indiana Jones one.
[36:08.90]I'm not hearing anything because of the tinnitus.
[36:18.25]it is I heard it's bad you're the only person that said that don't worry I do this all the time I heard you either love it or it sucks ass a gun and a whip you'd be surprised how often it comes in handy
[36:44.85]it's really fun okay if you're on the 3DO now you have to wait another like 40 years before you can play that oh no fluffy oh no butterscotch
[37:18.32]I'm not exactly sure what we just saw.
[37:28.23]Dude!
[37:28.37]Ascensions!
[37:28.81]Trials!
[37:29.03]You need set piece that gives plus 16% strength!
[37:35.13]What's it called?
[37:45.80]You know the one.
[37:47.28]Path of Exile 2.
[37:50.83]There are no set pieces.
[37:51.83]50 bosses?
[37:56.37]Let me tell you right now, those of you that want to hear my ARPG take, because, you know, I'm the ARPG guy.
[38:01.67]It's me.
[38:02.19]I'm the ARPG guy in this call.
[38:05.00]I played Diablo, Diablo, Diablo, and Diablo.
[38:09.66]And then I played Grim Dawn through the second act of Early Access and forgot I bought it seven years later and never played it again.
[38:17.95]So here's my take.
[38:19.63]You played Victor Vran.
[38:20.69]You did play a good one.
[38:21.99]Okay, that's true.
[38:24.23]Path of Exile 2.
[38:25.65]A plus so far.
[38:27.01]I love it.
[38:27.49]I love it.
[38:27.99]I love it.
[38:28.59]It's everything I want a D4 to be.
[38:30.77]Oh, what the fuck?
[38:31.87]Did you hear that?
[38:32.97]What?
[38:33.15]It's very good.
[38:45.09]From HBO's House of the Dragon, please welcome Abubakar Saleem.
[38:53.39]Turn the stream up.
[38:54.25]I turn it down so you can hear us talk.
[38:55.65]Because that's why you're here.
[38:57.90]Thank you.
[38:58.40]Don't worry, I'm not going to cry about my dead dad this time.
[39:01.18]Can you lower them?
[39:03.18]I'm here to present an award that celebrates victory.
[39:06.32]The thrill of conquering your foes in a battle where physical and mental prowess collide in a struggle that feels like the most important fight of your life.
[39:15.95]And no, I'm not talking about Twitter, but I am talking about the best action game.
[39:21.87]Here are your nominees.
[39:23.67]What even came out this year?
[39:24.77]Let's see.
[39:25.09]Okay, did you play any of the games on this list?
[39:28.36]Yes, I did.
[39:29.38]I played Black Myth Wukong.
[39:31.04]I did.
[39:31.54]I did as well.
[39:32.84]I played Call of Duty Campaign.
[39:34.62]I did not.
[39:34.94]I beat it.
[39:38.09]Played Helldivers 2.
[39:38.87]We played this.
[39:40.83]I convinced you.
[39:41.53]Yeah.
[39:43.23]Did not play this.
[39:44.61]Did not.
[39:49.31]Did not.
[39:49.69]Did not, but I feel bad that I didn't play Space Marine.
[39:53.84]Feels like it could be a pretty good action game.
[39:56.04]And the game award goes to Black Myth Wukong.
[40:02.76]I actually really... Okay, here's what I liked about... I didn't... Let's make it really clear.
[40:06.94]I played the game for about maybe four and a half, five hours total.
[40:12.71]I like that you can transform into... The weapons transform you.
[40:17.11]That's really cool.
[40:17.81]I like it.
[40:20.43]I didn't beat it though.
[40:21.51]I got like maybe halfway through the first act.
[40:25.83]I felt like all it was missing for me was the feeling like I would get a new weapon or a new ability I didn't already see on the skill tree.
[40:33.66]That very quickly...
[40:36.72]I wanted to explore more, but I like when you're the monkey and you go up on the stick and you stand on the stick.
[40:42.20]That's cool.
[40:43.24]I wanted more standing on the stick abilities.
[40:46.17]You wanted to stand on the stick more.
[40:47.99]Mm-hmm.
[41:03.34]Thank you, everyone.
[41:04.68]We are deeply honored to receive these awards.
[41:08.24]A heartfelt thanks to every player.
[41:10.02]It's you who brought the tale of wisdom and courage rooted in Eastern mythology to life on this stage.
[41:18.53]And of course, a sincere gratitude to the Game Awards for not placing any invisible walls on my way up here.
[41:33.79]You're not clapping.
[41:35.21]I clapped in my head and I said, I nodded.
[41:44.08]Did you hear the tea kettle about to go?
[41:45.18]Yeah, I do.
[41:45.50]Someone needs to get that.
[41:46.26]Is that the stream or is that coming from us?
[41:48.20]That's the stream.
[41:48.96]Somebody in production was like, where the fuck is that coming from?
[42:11.15]Somebody turn, stop stepping on a wire.
[42:13.43]Who's fucking doing that?
[42:14.85]Somebody was just screaming backstage.
[42:16.35]Their face was purple.
[42:20.17]Lastly, I want to say this.
[42:21.25]Our game isn't hard at all.
[42:22.41]It's perfect for players new to action games.
[42:25.63]Trust me on this.
[42:26.17]Thank you.
[42:44.83]But it actually isn't.
[42:45.61]I beat it.
[42:46.13]I beat it.
[42:46.55]I first tried that boss.
[42:47.73]I beat that boss first try, you know, Jerma.
[42:56.84]Congratulations, Game Science.
[42:58.60]I hear that all the time from my show.
[42:59.62]At the Game Awards, our aspiration is to create moments that define our medium and remind us all why we became fans in the first place.
[43:07.69]Five years ago, I had the pleasure of having lunch with one of our industry's most treasured game makers.
[43:13.91]And just recently, he finally shared an ambitious vision for his next project.
[43:19.00]Why are you name dropping yourself in this?
[43:21.06]As a very special gift for our 10th anniversary.
[43:22.94]This game's cool.
[43:23.90]This game's sick.
[43:25.22]I had lunch with this guy.
[43:26.70]Stunning new project for the first time anywhere.
[43:29.64]It's an early look at real gameplay footage of this studio's highly anticipated upcoming title.
[43:36.79]If you had lunch with some really important people in the industry, you don't think you'd be like, I had lunch with this person.
[43:41.49]I would not.
[43:44.88]What if they were like, hey, man, like, let's talk.
[43:46.34]You really should talk about this lunch.
[43:47.88]What if what if it was the other person's idea?
[43:49.68]OK, you're sitting down for lunch with so-and-so Barack Obama.
[43:53.25]And right before he gets up and leaves, he pulls his chair back.
[43:56.09]He stands up.
[43:56.49]He says, let me be clear.
[43:58.47]Tell people that you had lunch with Barack.
[44:02.87]Tell people that you had lunch with me today.
[44:05.41]I want you to tell everybody you had lunch with me.
[44:08.03]Yeah.
[44:09.98]Hey, this is actually I've played all these games and I liked them all.
[44:17.63]it's kind of like are you gonna post this kind of thing right yeah I noticed you didn't take a picture of your food oh you didn't is this going on the insta or not you're not going to post this are you going to post this I'm looking for maybe some get some followers out of this alright just quiet just quiet
[44:48.68]Start laser at 1030 seconds.
[44:50.67]25 seconds.
[44:54.61]20 seconds.
[44:59.07]10 seconds.
[44:59.63]10 seconds.
[45:03.38]10 seconds.
[45:37.27]Amen.
[45:45.17]Okay.
[45:46.61]I will say I loved The Last Guardian.
[45:49.17]I just wish it ran more than like nine frames a second.
[45:53.12]I've been hearing that.
[45:55.24]Thank you so much for this announcement reveal.
[46:08.79]games are always really good though like really interesting marks the release of sid meyer's civilization 7. the latest installment one of our industries a little more successful franchises tonight we are honored to welcome the game awards orchestra conducted by Lauren balfe to world premiere the stunning theme to civ 7 composed by grammy award-winning composer Christopher tinn who joins us tonight
[46:34.22]I think you're going to love this.
[46:35.52]And it holds the camera on him, slow zooming for the next 30 seconds.
[46:45.38]Oh, they got the whole orchestra here.
[46:55.71]Tony said, dude, it looks like you were watching in a theater seat.
[46:59.71]So what?
[47:03.18]I'm getting flashed by the fucking big screen, okay?
[47:07.66]I told you, I don't sit at a desk anymore.
[47:10.04]I sit in front of the big screen.
[47:13.70]That's why you can see, anytime something crazy happens up here, you see it across my face like a projector.
[47:22.89]I don't sit at a desk anymore.
[47:24.49]No, I don't.
[47:25.07]You cannot believe you're still... How much are you spending renting a whole movie theater to stream every time?
[47:32.64]That'd be so fucking funny.
[47:36.94]Yeah, I mean, I don't really want my own setup at home, but can I rent out one of these rooms once every week or two?
[47:43.51]I'm a streamer, and I want a really cool setup once every couple weeks.
[47:48.17]What would that actually cost to do that?
[47:49.91]To rent a movie theater for one day?
[47:52.43]It can't be that much, right?
[47:54.43]I feel like you'd be the person who would know something that dumb.
[48:00.68]You're asking me.
[48:02.26]is it would it be more than like a few hundred bucks I guess that is a lot but like is it it depends how uh how big of a failure the movie theater is you can imagine like just being like streaming starting that stream no one can see that but you
[48:23.99]you're still capturing through OBS.
[48:26.03]It's not like anybody else gets to experience that.
[48:29.18]No, you can do a whole react stream.
[48:31.06]So I feel like you elevate the content the moment you put it up on a big screen in the theater.
[48:35.30]And you're what the that old show where you'd have the silhouettes of the characters at the bottom.
[48:40.28]Like Mr. Science Theater.
[48:43.23]Yeah.
[48:48.46]I guess you could like... No, but the only reason why you do that was for just total opulence dickhead shit.
[48:54.97]That would only exist to like have the camera go full cam and it'd be like, here I am, look everybody, look at how big the screen is.
[49:01.75]It's like, okay, dude, like you're a fucking asshole.
[49:04.03]Like, what?
[49:05.85]Like, why do we, why do you need to do that?
[49:07.61]Why do you need to show us this?
[49:09.07]You could have just played this at your house.
[49:11.87]How hard do you think it is for Jeff to say all these fake adjectives that he can't even say anything about what the game actually is?
[49:18.00]A previously nominated, award-winning studio of high merit.
[49:43.71]Neverwinter Nights 2?
[49:46.02]I played Neverwinter Nights and I made a bard and I whistled three times and I hated the game and I uninstalled it.
[49:50.72]We were not paying attention.
[49:52.00]I was like, there is no spaceship in Neverwinter Nights.
[49:55.86]Is this Outer Worlds 2?
[50:00.44]Yeah, you played a different Neverwinter.
[50:04.22]Did I?
[50:04.78]What was the one that I played where I was so excited to make a bard and the character just went like...
[50:11.46]He like whistled and his hand went in the air.
[50:14.16]And I didn't have an attack move and I just kept dying.
[50:16.34]Things just kept killing me and I couldn't even play the game.
[50:20.74]That's a cool bard character.
[50:25.17]That took three times longer to make.
[50:28.11]But will almost certainly be two times bigger.
[50:33.29]Baby, baby, baby, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[50:36.48]B-b-b-b-baby, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[50:39.46]Stream down.
[50:42.00]Stream is over now.
[50:44.02]The VOD is gone.
[50:47.02]Can you give me your best b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-baby?
[50:48.75]B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-baby back ribs.
[50:49.37]You didn't get, you did not get the part.
[50:50.53]I can't.
[50:50.79]B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-
[51:04.99]Sorry, I wasn't like, I wasn't ready to perform tonight.
[51:08.65]The Outer Worlds 2.
[51:10.97]I was asleep before this.
[51:14.96]I went out there.
[51:15.96]I had my suit.
[51:17.00]I had my tap dancing shoes on.
[51:18.54]I had my cane.
[51:19.45]And it was like, and here comes the Jerma and Ster.
[51:23.48]TIME TO WATCH THE GAME AWARDS!
[51:24.98]And I had, like, I was out there dancing and like, You just were fucking, you knew nowhere to be found.
[51:30.64]I had to stall for 25 straight minutes.
[51:33.26]Just me doing the tap routine.
[51:35.42]Man, 20 minutes of screaming yourself?
[51:37.85]You understand, whenever I point to the, when the music gets to your part and you tap dance and I stand to the side, I had to do your part.
[51:43.75]It's fucking hard.
[51:45.05]No, I give you credit.
[51:46.77]Oh, it's this guy.
[51:47.59]No, no, no, listen, listen.
[51:52.97]Yeah, how does he make a new game every year?
[51:54.61]I don't know.
[51:54.89]He like made the Game Awards laugh once.
[51:57.39]And he got free press for life.
[51:58.55]He got the Willy Wonka ticket.
[51:59.57]The games are all bangers though.
[52:00.39]That's what you don't understand.
[52:39.78]okay you better get ready because I'm about to show you hazelight's next co-op adventure called split fiction let me tell you this get ready for a ride you play as mio and zoe they don't have to hire anybody but this guy now to get published by a new tech company that can simulate their stories to life I can't do this please calm down accidentally they end up in the same simulation
[53:09.04]What are you doing in my story?
[53:10.88]Something bad is going on here.
[53:12.76]And there, they find out that their stories are about to get stolen.
[53:16.87]No one escapes my simulation.
[53:22.09]And in order to save them, they have to escape back to reality through the very worlds that they created.
[53:27.77]Why would you ever want to be like an evil guy?
[53:30.14]Like, do you know what I mean?
[53:30.94]Like that?
[53:31.32]What do you get from that?
[53:32.50]I don't know, you get to keep people in your simulation.
[53:42.54]and a fantasy world I think it powers the machines we at hazelight love variation and you'll have a unique mechanic for every level let me give you some examples in this level you start off by finding dragon eggs that hatch hey stop licking
[54:05.76]And then they become a little bit bigger dragons with new abilities.
[54:09.87]I decided to make every video game ever into one game.
[54:14.45]And now we can fly around and kick ass.
[54:22.20]In another level, you play these ball droids that can magnetize and shift to different forms.
[54:26.81]How much you want to bet this is, like, he has a notebook of video game ideas, and he just went, he walked into the fucking meeting room and he took his big, dusty-ass book, he threw it on the table and said, that's the game.
[54:41.05]Yeah, I think he's starting to Steve Jobs it.
[54:42.95]He's just saying all the music in this.
[54:46.20]Anyway, let's not talk about that level for now.
[54:48.40]Do the hot dog stage.
[54:49.92]With the friends pass, you only need to buy one copy of the game to play with.
[54:54.00]This looks great.
[54:54.76]I think this looks fun.
[54:56.02]No loot boxes, no microtransactions, and no bullshit.
[55:00.07]You just get the game.
[55:02.07]And no bullshit.
[55:03.73]Oh yeah, you know what other game ran on?
[55:05.65]What other game was promoted on that premise?
[55:08.57]Lawbreakers.
[55:13.21]No, that's not even, come on.
[55:15.49]That's not even, this is not law-breaking.
[55:20.60]And the good, look, look, wait.
[55:22.34]The good part with this, this game is coming out March 6th.
[55:25.30]So you will be playing it in two months.
[55:27.08]So that's nothing.
[55:30.46]One more thing.
[55:31.44]Just want to say in the trailer, they called me and Zoe, my daughters, it's their name.
[55:35.86]They're also in the audience.
[55:37.15]Put the camera, let them show how cute they are.
[55:43.35]She is so like... Yeah, of course.
[55:46.77]My wife is beautiful too.
[55:48.25]I don't forget to.
[55:48.93]I didn't like that game.
[55:50.57]Yes, and I want to say one last thing.
[55:52.75]My team Hazel is watching at home.
[55:55.37]My beautiful team.
[55:56.13]I just want to say thank you.
[55:58.37]And thank you everybody.
[55:59.07]I love you so much.
[55:59.83]I'm looking forward to be part of this industry.
[56:02.01]You know what?
[56:03.39]He's what Peter Molyneux kind of wished he was.
[56:08.54]Do you know what I mean by that?
[56:10.04]He's like if Peter Molyneux actually like continued to make things.
[56:15.42]And like the things he made, people liked.
[56:18.54]Isn't that just every game developer?
[56:20.22]But like that, that like kind of, that solo kind of mind, that like creative mind.
[56:23.73]Yeah, yeah.
[56:23.95]Everybody wants to do that.
[56:41.60]And yet somehow, no, actually, I agree.
[56:43.82]No, but it's that kind of your, like, kind of the cult of personality, right?
[56:48.96]Like, hey, it's me.
[56:49.98]It's just the thing that me and my team came up with.
[56:52.49]Peter Molyneux would always get up there and be like, this is the craziest.
[56:55.53]Like, that guy got up there and was like, this is the craziest shit ever.
[56:58.55]I'm about to show you some fucking crazy shit.
[57:00.99]Everyone was like, okay, yeah, you, because you're going to.
[57:03.55]At the end of this game, you're going to think that the dog was really your dog.
[57:08.49]But if he said that, I'd believe him.
[57:09.95]If Peter Molyneux said it, I would not believe him.
[57:12.11]Do you see what I mean?
[57:14.01]Well, Peter Molyneux's delivery is like, matter of fact, this is reality.
[57:19.35]And his is, you can fly the freaking plane.
[57:23.95]And yeah, he shows it.
[57:24.93]Then he shows it.
[57:27.35]That's probably game of the year.
[57:35.55]I guess like the kind of shit talk that you can back up.
[57:41.13]In a way.
[57:41.79]Not that Peter Molyneux was a shit talker.
[57:43.67]Like that's not what he was.
[57:46.03]And let's be fair.
[57:47.23]Let's be fair.
[57:47.92]At a certain point, he should have just changed.
[57:50.62]Peter Molyneux did create and, you know, part of that studio, which what was it?
[57:54.72]What was the original studio that... There was a lot of great stuff that he had a huge part of.
[58:00.16]Like Fable, the original Fable.
[58:01.79]That's Peter Molyneux, right?
[58:03.31]Like it was Bullfrog, yep.
[58:05.73]Bullfrog and Lionhead.
[58:07.69]Those two studios went on to make some really great shit.
[58:10.22]So, I mean, was Peter Moaner really?
[58:13.06]Like, I think he was pretty good.
[58:15.88]People just remember the cube, okay?
[58:17.44]The cube is a kind of a... Yeah, that's right, the cube.
[58:20.44]You can't forget the cube, unfortunately.
[58:30.49]The cube kind of really rises to the top every time his name comes up.
[58:35.73]But Fable exists.
[58:38.79]And back then, that was a really, really intricate, detailed, really fun game.
[58:43.05]I loved Fable.
[58:43.83]Yep, Fable 1 and 2 are like real good.
[58:49.73]Real good time.
[58:56.07]What is this?
[58:56.83]A little squishy.
[59:06.35]Oh my god, we can do this on stream, kind of.
[59:07.79]No, no, no, no, never mind.
[59:09.13]This is spoiler, kind of.
[59:11.41]I mean, I'm Path of Exile 2.
[59:12.93]A mercenary?
[59:16.01]Mercenary gameplay?
[59:16.93]No, no.
[59:17.37]I got to the... I got... Remember we talked about the, oh, the dev, you know, talking about, oh, the dev was like, this is... They're going to get to this, and they're going to say this is wicked fucked up, right?
[59:25.97]This right here, they're going to see this at the Game Awards and things like that.
[59:28.99]This game is wicked fucked up.
[59:30.49]Yeah, I got to that point.
[59:31.29]We're going to go on stage right after the, like, family-friendly game.
[59:36.27]I got to the point in PoE 2 where the devs are like, this is wicked fucked up.
[59:40.68]They're going to come across this and say, this is fucked up.
[59:43.62]I got to it.
[59:44.06]Is that like half of the game?
[59:45.86]No, that one part in particular near the end of Act 3 is like, that place was fucked up.
[59:54.12]Alright, we're back here at the Game Awards and we have so much more to share with you.
[59:56.56]They did it for a good reason.
[59:58.00]Don't spoil it.
[59:58.70]What? Fuck you.
[59:58.80]What are you laughing at?
[60:15.78]Because he has to inject himself and how like every single thing and it's just weird.
[60:18.78]When this game was being made I was writing my thesis in college and it was- it was- it went on to be one of the biggest best thesises of all time.
[60:27.78]I know that's a little not related but here's an Elden Ring trailer.
[60:33.78]Hey, he wanted to put this whole thing together- you are a hater.
[60:39.78]I just want Kojima to come on stage and kiss him. End of story. Do something brave and bold.
[60:43.92]But this year, inside of these challenges, we found greatness.
[60:48.82]I'm proud to share with you the story of a single individual who saw developers in need and did something truly extraordinary.
[60:57.44]Meet TGA's first ever game changer.
[61:03.17]Starting in early 2023, significant waves of layoffs started in the games industry.
[61:10.59]It strikes you, it hurts, right?
[61:12.61]It's like a ton of bricks.
[61:13.96]What am I supposed to do?
[61:16.18]Tens of thousands of gamers have been laid off at a level that is unprecedented in the industry's history.
[61:22.72]I love this brand.
[61:23.66]I love this company.
[61:24.47]Oh my goodness, what am I going to do?
[61:26.93]I actually started in games relatively late.
[61:29.85]Even though I've loved the industry ever since I was a little child, because there weren't games jobs around here, I stayed passionate about it and broke through in basically my late 30s.
[61:41.51]I had seen a few friends get laid off before Thanksgiving, and I said to my wife, Jess, like, this is unacceptable.
[61:47.65]Hi, everybody.
[61:48.61]It's Amir, and I'm here to help support you as you look for your next opportunity in video games.
[61:54.64]I can't imagine what it must feel like for someone to have to go to their family around the holidays and say, I don't have a job.
[62:00.60]I don't know what's going to happen.
[62:02.18]I had a robust background in things like data analysis, and I said, well, I can do something with this.
[62:07.67]I started a community with one resource,
[62:10.37]We just started putting together a list of all the job openings out there.
[62:14.19]And over iteration after iteration, it ended up becoming a suite of several different resources.
[62:20.14]We have 2,300 coaching volunteers who've given people over 50,000.
[62:25.52]Yeah, they're like, we have nothing to say about this.
[62:30.32]This is industry.
[62:31.71]I mean, this is just not a game.
[62:33.41]Well, this is important.
[62:36.33]You know, this is not that the games aren't important, but this is a good way to see what's going on in the fucking industry.
[62:40.61]Amir is like career Santa Claus.
[62:44.41]We're learning things.
[62:56.46]Please join me in welcoming a man who has the well-being of the game developer community in his heart.
[63:01.69]On behalf of the Game Awards, I'm honored to present the first ever TGA Game Changer, Amir Saatvaat.
[63:08.47]That background is wild.
[63:11.50]I want to see that background again.
[63:16.44]I'm trying to move into a better movie theater for your streams.
[63:20.50]Rent out this whole place.
[63:24.42]Okay, but the movie theory idea happens, but the whole time is your, like, five rows back just throwing popcorn at me every so often.
[63:34.13]And I kind of just, like, turn around.
[63:35.27]I'm like, who's doing that?
[63:36.27]Like, what the fuck?
[63:37.55]And you hide every time.
[63:38.51]And it's, like, a really funny gag that happens the whole time.
[63:42.40]Like a goblin.
[63:44.95]Thank you so much.
[63:46.83]And every time you throw a piece of popcorn at me, we go to a wide of the theater and I turn around, it's like the same funny thing again.
[63:54.12]It never stops.
[63:57.62]I'd rather just eat the popcorn.
[63:58.68]Yeah, me too.
[63:59.12]I love video games with all my heart.
[64:08.80]To all game makers everywhere, you are seen and treasured, and our community will always be there to help you.
[64:17.79]Over the last three years, we've lost more than 34,000 jobs, a staggering amount of games experience eliminated.
[64:25.96]This has consequences.
[64:28.40]You can't make great games without great people.
[64:40.31]I'm proud of so many of you who have already joined me to make an impact, and I really have to thank everyone in our community who gave all their time and commitment to build it.
[64:51.68]As we gather here tonight for this amazing celebration, I challenge everyone to ask themselves, what more can we each do to make our industry better?
[65:02.88]I dedicate this to my grandparents in heaven and to our Game Awards watch party back home, my wife, our three sons, and my parents, who really devoted their lives to me and taught me that my value lies in how I treat other people.
[65:28.02]Growing up, all I ever wanted was to be a part of the video game industry.
[65:32.80]As a kid from Farmington, Connecticut, it felt a world away.
[65:37.31]Not anymore.
[65:38.09]Thank you very, very much.
[65:39.73]Thank you.
[65:40.05]Thank you.
[65:44.57]What was the name of the database of the kind of whole resource that was built?
[65:50.98]Microsoft Excel?
[65:55.40]Omega Day 2067.
[66:00.42]We witnessed the end of the old world and the beginning of an unimaginable power.
[66:08.97]Now, of course, we are back to constant conflict.
[66:15.65]Forging souls into steel.
[66:20.44]Turning hope into a hunt.
[66:24.84]Oh, armored car.
[66:25.88]They brought robots back.
[66:27.20]Of humanity.
[66:29.09]Constant conflict.
[66:32.68]I can't wait till I have my game come out and it's... Jeremy Elbertson presents Constant Conflict.
[66:46.57]I'm gonna make sure I'm one of those.
[66:47.75]I'm gonna make sure I have one of them, but I'm a Jeremy Elbertson presents in the title.
[66:52.57]You don't realize that like the war game is this the people who make World of Tanks decided to not like.
[66:59.05]Are they leaking like alien spaceship blueprints now?
[67:06.92]Yeah, it's actually yeah, you can play this.
[67:11.89]I would love a game like this with the big mechs to be a good game.
[67:15.09]I would very much love for this to be good.
[67:17.89]Rise of the robots.
[67:21.14]But this is your time.
[67:25.12]That's War Thunder.
[67:26.34]Oh, OK.
[67:29.32]Is this seriously?
[67:30.60]That's such a weird turn for their company.
[67:35.49]Damn, hey.
[67:37.73]It's hey, join the PC beta Steel Hunters.
[67:42.06]Power Rangers.
[67:42.46]Who I had lunch with, last week.
[67:43.80]Yeah, this guy's a real great guy.
[68:09.22]I watched his house for a weekend when he was gone with his dog...
[68:15.22]Oftentimes on Wednesday nights I would think about this person and here's his game.
[68:21.22]You're just a hater.
[68:24.22]I'm an observer.
[68:44.91]Co-op.
[68:47.85]Co-op.
[68:51.47]Co-op RPG.
[68:58.14]You painting yourself neon pink in this world?
[69:05.66]Well, if you don't want to stick out like a sore thumb in the woods, mate.
[69:11.83]Long Dark 2.
[69:12.37]Did you ever play the Long Dark one?
[69:16.47]I did not.
[69:17.37]It was an early access for what felt like 40 years.
[69:20.83]It looked interesting.
[69:23.29]I didn't even know that it was... I thought they were still doing it.
[69:26.86]That game looks like a... gigantic leap ahead.
[69:31.79]Borderlands.
[69:33.21]Borderlands.
[69:34.01]This is the moment.
[69:35.49]Everybody at Gearbox is watching right now and I'm kind of freaked out.
[69:38.96]People love this guy, right?
[69:41.04]Listen, this is the thing.
[69:42.06]You fans of Borderlands, you're why we fight.
[69:45.46]Every pixel of Borderlands is made with heart and soul.
[69:49.49]Handcrafted by the Gearbox team.
[69:51.19]They don't make it with pixels.
[69:52.41]We're all giving it everything we got, you guys.
[69:54.21]We're putting everything we have into this game.
[69:55.45]You're not stacking blocks, dude.
[69:56.23]And listen, I can go on talking about Borderlands 4, or I could just show you Borderlands 4.
[70:04.08]Who wants me to keep talking?
[70:06.64]Nobody!
[70:08.34]And who wants me to roll the trailer for Borderlands Mother Fluffin' 4?
[70:15.87]When was the last Borderlands game you played?
[70:18.25]I know when mine was.
[70:21.43]I think the original.
[70:23.19]I think Borderlands 2.
[70:26.69]Pretty recently, actually.
[70:27.79]Just messing around.
[70:28.85]Alright, let's watch the trailer for Borderlands 4.
[70:30.35]Shut up!
[70:45.43]this game's gonna have a huge boost of players coming after the uh the movie yeah I think that movie did I want to say two to three hundred dollars people oh two to three hundred people saw it
[71:26.24]Hey, it's Handsome Jack.
[71:27.58]You didn't think I'd be back again, but I sure am.
[71:30.31]Those vault hunters thought they got rid of me, but not like they thought.
[71:34.07]Unfortunately, cryogenics exist.
[71:36.63]Come on!
[71:39.45]That was good.
[71:41.25]You really did play recently.
[71:44.10]You rehearsed.
[71:46.16]I rehearsed, huh?
[71:51.76]This time, I'm coming back as something a little bit different.
[71:54.98]And it zooms in on his face, and there's one of those frees with a text that says, Ugly Jack joins the fray.
[72:02.76]I've definitely missed a lot of Borderlands.
[72:04.32]I thought we were, like, in the desert.
[72:07.12]I thought we were in the Borderlands.
[72:08.48]He's like, that's right, I'm fucking ugly.
[72:15.98]And then he goes up a whole huge narrative and we get to hear him talk and talks about a bunch of stuff that happened.
[72:22.27]Oh yeah, I'm pretty ugly.
[72:23.75]Can you get me 14 glooblets?
[72:32.63]Somebody said that's unbelievably mid.
[72:35.93]That was Borderlands 4, and now we have an exciting and unexpected announcement from a legendary role-playing game franchise.
[72:44.79]Here it is again.
[72:45.37]Here we have another big, awesome thing that I can't say anything about.
[72:50.75]On this, I sword I swear to shield the Firebird's flame forevermore.
[72:56.50]Was he accused of stealing it?
[72:59.86]You guys would have no idea how many fucking NDAs I had to sign over the last two weeks.
[73:04.44]My hand hurts, okay?
[73:06.30]Here's another trailer.
[73:07.54]God, give me some fucking slack.
[73:12.06]Yo, we're Tekkening.
[73:16.20]Ooh.
[73:16.86]That's a pretty cool crossover.
[73:19.98]Weren't you a Tekken fan for a little bit?
[73:22.99]I was really liking it on launch.
[73:28.54]This game was actually really fun too.
[73:30.20]I didn't beat it, but it was fun.
[73:32.38]Final Fantasy.
[73:34.08]I remember you being really into it.
[73:35.79]I feel like... You know what?
[73:39.37]Like, Elden Ring is super hard.
[73:41.57]Like, can you beat Elden Ring?
[73:44.17]But it's the op... In Final Fantasy, this game's really long.
[73:47.59]Can you beat it?
[73:48.49]It's the same level of, like, tenacity you need.
[73:51.85]That's actually a pretty funny point.
[73:53.41]That's a good point.
[73:56.79]Like, can you watch all the cutscenes and like, when you do one quest, there's 45 minutes before you will actively be doing the next one.
[74:06.46]If you can get through that, it's one of the best games.
[74:08.62]Well, that's not even to say the story's bad.
[74:11.75]It's just like, I don't know that I would watch a 240-hour movie.
[74:19.35]Don't you think that Grand Theft Auto 6 should have been grayed out?
[74:21.71]Like, it's just not selectable.
[74:22.83]Best multiplayer game?
[74:24.39]Helldivers 2?
[74:25.21]Probably Helldivers, right?
[74:36.63]Dude, I just called it.
[74:37.95]Oh, I just called it.
[74:40.11]What?
[74:40.83]I just called it.
[74:41.69]Gamers choose.
[74:42.17]Dude, bro, I called it.
[74:43.63]Baldur's Gate 3.
[74:44.41]Dude, I called it.
[74:46.03]Oh, my God, dude, I called it.
[74:47.53]No way.
[74:47.90]That's two in a row.
[74:49.12]I can't believe No Man's Sky lost its own category.
[75:07.75]Best art direction.
[75:08.61]This is Elden Ring.
[75:10.85]Elden Ring Shadow of the Urge Free.
[75:12.31]Dude, I know something's wrong.
[75:18.93]I don't have it anymore.
[75:20.05]I thought you had it.
[75:21.19]I thought you had the special touch.
[75:23.27]I gotta go.
[75:23.89]Dude, I think I gotta go.
[75:32.43]Oh no.
[75:34.37]I just don't trust any game that starts with this exact music.
[75:40.80]Like the, hey, you better get ready.
[75:42.46]You better get pumped.
[75:43.46]You better get ready to feel it.
[75:44.96]Stop telling me how to feel.
[75:47.08]Yeah.
[75:47.82]Any game that actually tells you, you better get ready to feel it.
[75:50.50]You better get ready to feel this.
[75:52.48]I don't know if I'm going to feel it.
[75:53.30]I'm not going to stop until I'm on top.
[76:14.39]Are you feeling it?
[76:17.15]I'm feeling it for two days.
[76:19.07]You're feeling it for two days.
[76:21.15]Yeah, it's it's the classic FPS multiplayer for like two days.
[76:24.57]This will be sick and then you won't like it's over.
[76:29.23]A lot of people like split gate one though.
[76:30.75]I don't know.
[76:31.25]I didn't try it, so I'd be down to try that one.
[76:33.21]I thought it looked pretty good.
[76:36.03]Looks like fun.
[76:38.71]Oh, speaking of games that had a trailer with that music Dragon Age.
[76:43.46]What, you better get ready to feel it?
[76:45.75]Yeah, her original trailer was pretty much like that.
[76:48.89]Wait, the original trailer for this game, for Dragon Age?
[76:54.17]Yeah, I remember being kind of weird.
[76:57.01]And everybody had a weird, like, wait, is this actually Dragon Age?
[77:01.25]And they had to walk it back and be like, no, seriously, it's actually a Dragon Age game.
[77:11.18]I don't know.
[77:11.56]Is there like an app I can get instead?
[77:13.43]I don't know.
[77:13.77]You know what I mean?
[77:14.41]Is there an app?
[77:16.51]Yeah.
[77:16.71]I mean, this game looks like really good, but it's still like an app I can just get to like just, you know.
[77:27.07]Wait, an app for what?
[77:33.00]I love games that destroy the stream bitrate.
[77:39.56]I have said this a long time ago.
[77:41.02]No, no, listen.
[77:44.42]The entire video game industry needs to hear this said.
[77:46.96]I said it a couple of years ago as well.
[77:49.59]You correct, somebody correct me.
[77:51.87]Is anybody else sick of the neon pink, neon green, neon blue?
[77:56.87]Like bloom.
[78:00.71]The bloomed neon green.
[78:02.92]It's like, it's like in everything.
[78:04.24]I don't know.
[78:04.88]I'm getting old.
[78:05.52]Are any of you guys sick of colors yet?
[78:07.26]No, no.
[78:07.82]It's the specific light emanating thing.
[78:11.53]It's just bouncing around.
[78:13.23]It's just RGB.
[78:14.11]Oh, you don't get it.
[78:14.81]He doesn't get it.
[78:15.75]Hey, hey, hey, everybody.
[78:17.15]He doesn't get it.
[78:18.98]Neon pink with bloom on it.
[78:21.04]On everything.
[78:21.98]Neon blue, neon green.
[78:24.44]You have a weapon that doesn't even need to have a neon pink light come out of it, but it's going to be neon pink lights everywhere.
[78:32.00]Why is everything bloomed, neon pink, and neon green?
[78:37.19]People might think I'm crazy.
[78:37.95]That's fine.
[78:38.47]I'll be the weird one.
[78:40.75]The amount of... I see it everywhere.
[78:42.61]It's in every fucking video game.
[78:50.29]I love how we have the live translation from you.
[78:52.21]I thought you were going to be with me on this one.
[78:57.31]I actually am, though.
[78:58.51]I agree.
[78:58.89]I'm just, you know, I'm being a problem.
[79:01.80]Are you not?
[79:02.54]Arcane?
[79:11.49]featuring royal and the serpent David you see arcane season two I did not dude I saw season one I saw the first three episodes of arcane season one and was like oh man alright that was alright that was cool and then I just never played it ever I just never watched it ever again I just I just gave up on it I didn't and I don't care either I don't think I'm going to
[79:36.45]You don't care?
[79:36.97]I liked it a lot.
[79:38.63]Season 1 especially.
[79:40.26]I know.
[79:40.58]I know.
[79:40.80]It's very good.
[79:41.60]But I just can't... I don't know.
[79:42.98]It's like other things that get in the way.
[79:44.56]Anytime Arcane Episode 4 gets queued up on Netflix or whatever, I just don't do... I'm just like, nah, I'm going to do something else.
[79:55.00]I think it was getting too emotional for you and you couldn't like face it.
[80:02.39]You saw like Powder crying and you couldn't help her.
[80:11.59]That's cool.
[80:13.63]I mean, it looks great.
[80:14.76]It sounds great.
[80:15.84]I'm sure it's great.
[80:16.70]I just every time I get to that point where I'm going to watch it, I think about, oh, wait a minute.
[80:21.60]Hold on.
[80:23.20]Dude, you know, it'd be great if I played 10 million again right now and I just don't watch it.
[80:36.79]Are you like this with anything else?
[80:38.55]You ever have to be like kind of like you need somebody to just be like, oh, hey, hey, hey, dude, today we're watching Arcane episode four.
[80:47.30]And I'd be like, we are?
[80:48.86]Yes, that's what we're going to do.
[80:49.72]We're doing that now.
[80:50.96]Oh, okay, I guess.
[80:53.22]And you just have to like take over like the TV and then I'm going to love it.
[80:57.15]And I'll watch the whole fucking season.
[81:00.77]I'm trying to digest all this.
[81:03.11]I just realized, like, you're kind of a ADHD Andy.
[81:08.03]You're pooping, you're on your phone, you're playing 10 Million, you're doing this.
[81:10.76]Yeah.
[81:11.38]But I also don't picture you as a two-monitor guy.
[81:13.96]Like, you're not playing 10 Million and watching Arcane.
[81:17.08]Like, that was a choice.
[81:18.62]Yes, it is a choice.
[81:19.42]But, like, 3% of your attention is on...
[81:30.49]10 million so how why not two things no but I don't I I want to give full attention to a show because a show requires complete and total focus oh so you think that it deserves your full attention and you're incapable I get it I respect that I watched all the mad men last year from start to finish that was well I think I met that guy but I don't know the one mad guy ask me trivia about about mad men I'll give you any trivia
[81:59.69]Did I meet him or not?
[82:01.09]Was it him?
[82:02.43]I don't know.
[82:02.89]What the fuck?
[82:03.57]I don't know.
[82:04.75]I don't know who you meet.
[82:06.25]The gray-haired guy from Mad Men, he asked me where the train station was.
[82:09.31]I was like, I think that's that guy from Mad Men.
[82:11.05]And then I told him where the train station was.
[82:12.94]I wasn't there.
[82:13.70]Oh.
[82:17.22]Oh, he's forever so old.
[82:18.88]He's from the 40s.
[82:20.14]Did I meet this fella this old?
[82:22.82]I don't know.
[82:23.46]He had hair and I can't remember.
[82:29.55]I thought you were there.
[82:30.21]It was in Quincy.
[82:32.21]I don't know.
[82:32.73]Where did I meet this guy?
[82:38.02]You just need to say yes or no.
[82:40.88]I need clarity.
[82:41.74]People are pissed that we're talking over this, by the way.
[82:44.34]The first person's performance was actually so good.
[82:50.53]Well, let me watch it in my theater.
[82:55.69]Is this all- is this all spoilers?
[82:58.03]Who's that guy?
[82:58.65]Who's that guy?
[82:59.41]I don't know, that guy just exploded.
[83:01.73]Who is that?
[83:15.92]I'm actually getting spoiled.
[83:17.40]I don't play League of Legends.
[83:18.60]I don't know anything about any of the characters.
[83:20.42]This is like if they did the Lord of the Rings orchestra right after Lord of the Rings came out and like Gandalf is fighting the Balrog and falls off the bridge.
[83:28.33]No, this is like Lord of the Rings the movie ends and at the credits they play a recap of the movie.
[83:37.71]Holy shit.
[83:38.35]He hit that.
[83:39.05]Damn.
[83:39.39]Damn, that was good.
[83:45.35]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[83:47.01]We're just yapping over it.
[83:51.29]We didn't talk over the Microsoft Excel.
[84:03.86]The only thing I know about League of Legends is the starting soon screen, where VI is going like...
[84:14.69]And it's like, she's such a misfit, always ready to run.
[84:19.27]She's got a superpower and she's full of strife.
[84:22.77]And if you know you're strong.
[84:24.92]And that's, I don't know anything else about League of Legends.
[84:27.98]I don't know a lot about it either, but I feel like they still had like main menu screens that I'm aware of like that.
[84:34.38]Where like the Jinx one with the music and they had just like Jinx on like a airship.
[84:39.12]Yeah, that's the only thing I know.
[84:40.22]Never played League of Legends fully aware that that exists.
[84:43.68]I think the only reason why I know that is because I made a grandpa video where I played league and it was like don't watch that video it's a disaster it's literally after the show it's a zero out of ten on the on the richter scale that sounds like a banger
[85:13.56]Oh, conflict.
[85:14.32]We were just getting some environment.
[85:16.22]We were about to go touch grass.
[85:18.48]No, this constant conflict is never any dull moment ever.
[85:37.69]Are you?
[85:37.93]No.
[85:43.03]Whoa.
[85:46.69]That's actually kind of crazy.
[85:53.82]This game used to piss me off so much because I would just get ringed out.
[85:58.00]I remember I wouldn't even be able to play.
[85:59.14]I would go back up, back up, back up, and fall down and lose.
[86:03.32]I hope that comes back.
[86:04.12]I love rolling out as a full-caliber gamer.
[86:06.40]That's really cool.
[86:24.93]Oh, this is how things should look.
[86:26.61]Better get ready to feel it.
[86:28.25]No neons, no nothing.
[86:30.09]Just in the coal mines.
[86:41.18]Ah, they ruined it.
[86:42.00]Ladies and gentlemen.
[86:47.68]Tonight, I've got a little something special for you.
[86:51.89]We're going to try out a brand new tool.
[87:01.21]Oh, my.
[87:03.35]Is this a Yakuza game?
[87:05.71]I don't know.
[87:06.79]Oh, shit.
[87:07.65]It's right in the face.
[87:23.74]Holy shit!
[87:24.30]Oh my god!
[87:30.58]I'm into this!
[87:33.95]I wanna play this bad!
[87:34.75]This looks awesome!
[87:47.43]is this just like Dark Souls but like like real life just people what the hell that looks crazy you're the only person playing the game
[87:59.97]That's right RGG studio nominated tonight for four times for like a dragon infinite wealth has not one but two Projects in the works and we're honored to reveal both of those titles for the first time here tonight.
[88:10.79]Yeah that I'm into I want to play Please join me in welcoming a dear friend who also happens to be one of our industry's most innovative creative spirits He's been with us since the very beginning of TGA in 2014 And it's currently hard at work on Death Stranding 2 on the beach.
[88:26.62]Here he is.
[88:27.69]Here he comes
[88:29.35]industry icon hideo kajima here you were waiting for this how come you're not screaming the fireworks go off the sacrifices start being made the blood will flow you were waiting for this very moment every time there's such undeniable tension here this is like I'm on season 10 of a sitcom and I'm just waiting for them to get together and they never do
[88:55.49]I want to see what he's hearing.
[88:57.85]I want to see what he's hearing.
[88:58.97]Do you know Japanese?
[89:00.09]You hearing him?
[89:00.69]Yeah.
[89:14.60]It's a very important show that connects players.
[89:16.78]It's not just about games, but also movies, anime, and music.
[89:20.12]I think it's an important show that connects digital entertainment.
[89:23.67]I think it's going to get bigger and bigger in the next 20 to 30 years.
[89:29.83]I want to support it as much as possible.
[89:36.74]I've had the privilege of participating since the very first TGA.
[89:40.02]I feel like it'd be so stressful being a translator.
[89:42.58]Oh, now you talk, because you understood it all.
[89:45.24]No, no, that was a thought bubble.
[89:47.18]That was a thought bubble.
[89:49.23]But it has also evolved into an event that brings together industries professionals from around the world.
[89:55.33]focusing deeper connections with the players.
[89:57.81]TGA now serves as a bridge, not just within the gaming industry, but also between gaming and other digital entertainment, such as film, television, anime, and music.
[90:07.58]This role will undoubtedly become even more important in the next 20, 30 years.
[90:12.78]I'm looking forward to supporting that too.
[90:16.07]Game direction is a very important role that brings together a lot of ideas and makes them into one piece of work.
[90:22.13]There are a few hundred to a thousand teams that have been nominated for the title today, but there are also titles that have been made by a few people.
[90:32.90]Even small boats with hundreds of people on them, or huge boats with thousands of people on them, I think it's very important to find the right direction.
[90:40.90]And I think that's what Game Direction is all about.
[90:48.47]And they're going to play a 10-second trailer after this of a facial animation.
[90:52.63]...and uniting them into single cohesive work.
[90:55.53]Being a translator would be so hard.
[90:57.21]This award includes projects created by teams of hundreds or even thousands, as well as those made by just a few people.
[91:03.88]Yet all of them have a clear and unified vision.
[91:07.28]Whether it's a small boat, a large cruise ship, or a fleet of boats, a helmsman is required, and that helmsman is the direction.
[91:19.73]So, someone involved in direction, I'm honored to introduce the nominees for Best Game Direction.
[91:26.80]Best Game Direction.
[91:28.10]All of these games are like boats.
[91:30.72]Astro Bot.
[91:33.79]Balatro! Balatro!
[91:39.37]Hmmmmmm. Balatro!
[91:43.37]Wait, wait. That's not a new game.
[91:47.79]Balatro!
[91:51.79]I keep hearing this is good. Is this good?
[91:53.79]Wait what was it? I spaced out.
[91:55.79]Metaphor.
[91:56.79]I think it's good if you-
[92:01.22]Astro Bot!?
[92:06.22]Is this a K... I'm going to make a bit of... Okay.
[92:09.58]This was kind of like a game... They did this thing where they... Oh, we have Astro Bot.
[92:13.14]And it's like teaching you how to use the controller.
[92:14.88]Now we're going to make a real, like, fully developed game about it.
[92:18.70]This is kind of like... Is this like if Sneak King was like a 10 out of 10 game?
[92:26.27]Like, it was like a tie-in that they turned into something else?
[92:29.55]What is it?
[92:29.91]I don't know what Sneak King is.
[92:32.03]Can we get a more modern...
[92:34.27]Wow, thank you so much.
[92:35.37]We didn't have a speech ready for this one.
[92:37.99]This is really amazing.
[92:39.36]I want to play it.
[92:40.12]I keep hearing about it.
[92:40.96]I keep seeing stuff about it.
[92:46.12]You know, game direction is, of course, you know, like, as Kojima-san said, you know, like an ensemble of things and, you know.
[92:52.41]But actually, in our case, it's really like every single person on the team coming and really bringing their own vision and being responsible for their own work.
[93:01.18]So you are all game directors back home, and I really dedicate this one to you.
[93:04.61]Thank you so much.
[93:06.35]Surprise hit.
[93:07.73]I'll check it out for sure.
[93:08.65]I'll play it if it's that good.
[93:11.47]I mean, even the little kind of astrobot controller tutorial stuff was fun.
[93:18.35]It was actually like fun to play.
[93:22.22]Congratulations, Nico and Team Asobi.
[93:24.46]And now let's journey to another world for our next announcement.
[93:47.44]This is, like, Turok.
[93:50.72]What about it?
[93:51.36]You're gonna be pissed?
[93:54.22]I don't know.
[93:54.66]I don't know how I would feel.
[93:56.96]How do you feel?
[93:58.02]Is that a problem?
[93:59.72]It actually might be Turok.
[94:00.90]I would love a Turok that were, one, comprehensible, then, like, two... Yeah, I guess a new Turok could go hard.
[94:10.97]I just hope they sell it with a game guide.
[94:14.39]Show gameplay, please.
[94:26.90]It looks kind of crazy, actually.
[94:29.37]Turok is one of those things where it's just like, wouldn't it be fucking cool if you like shot dinosaurs and just embraces it?
[94:38.07]Well, if you think putting dinosaurs in it, I thought, is that Darth Vader?
[94:40.82]No, wait.
[94:43.16]No, it's not.
[94:45.75]Attention, citizens.
[94:47.68]Across the galaxy, the valiant Helldivers have fought to protect our way of life.
[94:52.70]But I am here with grave tidings.
[94:55.28]Managed democracy is imperiled like never before.
[94:58.88]Homes are being ravaged.
[95:00.57]Families are being abducted.
[95:02.79]And you could be next.
[95:05.29]That is, unless you direct your undivided attention to the following announcement.
[95:10.15]And remember, freedom conquers all.
[95:16.31]freedom big update they arrived without warning we on Earth laying waste to our peaceful colonies crushing all resistance they stole our citizens homes
[95:39.28]We couldn't stave off the corruption.
[95:41.90]We couldn't get away from the corruption.
[95:46.93]The onslaught of corruption.
[95:49.89]But when our citizens are attacked, our greatest heroes arrive to set them free.
[96:12.59]Together, we will save our people from this tortured existence.
[96:28.86]For we are those who stand in the way of all tyranny.
[96:35.25]Who will give our lives today for a freer tomorrow.
[96:41.70]who will take back control of freedom and deliver peace to our homes.

[97:05.43]And they said, you're not allowed to be excited for this.
[97:07.29]You didn't even get past the second level.
[97:08.99]Oh, fuck.
[97:09.33]Fuck you.
[97:13.86]Whoa, you caught one.
[97:15.48]You just destroyed one guy.
[97:17.72]Hello, everyone.
[97:18.86]Hi.
[97:19.51]Thank goodness for waterproof mascara.
[97:21.25]The music has been a lot.
[97:22.47]That's amazing.
[97:23.37]But hi, everyone.
[97:25.07]I'm here on behalf of the Warframe team.
[97:28.11]We are here at the 10th year of the Game Awards.
[97:31.27]I love the idea that they're going to make a new one.
[97:33.63]Have you seen Warframe 1999?
[97:38.71]Our irreplaceable community has allowed us the privilege to be up on stage 12 years later to present to the world our next major update.
[97:47.87]We are going to show you the final trailer for Warframe, 1998, and the release date.
[97:55.04]But before we hit play, if you don't know what Warframe is, if this is your first time hearing it, we don't know anymore either, but we're still having a lot of fun
[98:05.86]She said the thing you said.
[98:07.48]What you're going to see is Warframe.
[98:08.70]It's not a new game.
[98:09.45]That's why it's so confusing.
[98:10.47]Alright.
[98:10.77]Let's see it.
[98:11.25]Let's hear it.
[98:11.71]I think I have an idea of what Warframe is.
[98:35.00]I realize what I am asking.
[98:38.57]But you of all people understand what is at stake.
[98:44.85]For the sake of everything before and to come.
[98:53.86]The Scaldra think they've contained the outbreak here, but the tech rot here is different.
[99:00.93]Patient.
[99:03.71]Whoa, why did you get in fucking cars?
[99:05.29]I feel like this would be really hard to drive around in a game like this.
[99:23.08]I like light speed.
[99:24.16]That seems really hard and scary.
[99:27.32]Arthur, this plate is swarming with Skuldra.
[99:30.94]I've seen enough, Albrecht.
[99:33.16]Maybe we cut our losses like we should have done weeks ago.
[99:36.72]Albrecht, I have seen enough.
[99:39.25]I told you this was a set-off.
[99:40.85]You trotty!
[99:41.49]Get me out of here!
[99:56.88]You know, it kind of reminds me of like... Watchdogs?
[100:02.15]Almost like a Suda51 game or something.
[100:03.25]A little bit, yeah.
[100:12.05]That looks great, and if you're watching TGA on Twitch or Steam, you can get a free Nyx Warframe tonight during the show.
[100:18.71]Still to come, Snoop Dogg takes the stage with world premiere new music and the Game Awards poster returns.
[100:25.37]But first, earlier this year, Pow World took over the internet and broke records for the independent studio Pocket Pair.
[100:31.19]Tonight, we have a first look at the game's next update.
[100:41.12]I didn't play this either did you play this at all for any did you do this I did for six or so hours I watched some gameplay after that I I like get it it was neat I'm just not like a huge fan of this genre really not survival craft is yeah no I agree it's been so many years that
[101:15.48]You have to like really appreciate how cute they are.
[101:20.25]Machine gun?
[101:22.43]There are guns in this game?
[101:23.71]Why are you serious?
[101:29.07]I thought it was like... There's a shitload of guns apparently.
[101:34.57]It's mostly guns.
[101:37.66]Did you miss out on that note?
[101:39.70]That was entirely promoted as Pokémon with guns.
[101:43.26]And you're surprised about 50% of it.
[101:45.18]Missed the whole thing.
[101:46.82]I thought it was just like a Pokémon collect monsters game.
[101:49.51]Missed the entire memo that they were machine guns in it.
[101:52.03]Had absolutely no idea until right now.
[101:53.53]You assign your Pokémon to like work benches to build you machine guns.
[101:58.53]This feels like a ruse that 22,000 people are pulling on me right now that I just apparently didn't know that.
[102:08.42]Wow, that's a pretty crazy concept.
[102:10.82]Pokémon with guns.
[102:13.84]I did not know that.
[102:14.84]Okay.
[102:15.88]Well, that's kind of cool, I guess.
[102:26.33]Ow.
[102:27.21]No, that's the update, man.
[102:28.01]They just added guns for some reason.
[102:29.75]Like, it used to be a normal Pokémon game.
[102:31.83]No, but are you fucking with me?
[102:33.43]Is that for real?
[102:34.61]Because, like, is this just a joke that you're putting on me?
[102:38.25]on you why is it you made the trailer yeah how did I pull this joke on you the power world was a bit I've been doing finally caught up to you oh I can't laugh that hard I get I'm still like sick I can't laugh as hard I have to chill
[103:06.15]Alright, no more jokes.
[103:06.85]There's a lot of layers to that, why I think it's so funny.
[103:15.38]Okay.
[103:18.16]That's not an Xbox.
[103:18.80]Somebody said, dude, why do you have four-year-old's brain latency?
[103:21.96]I don't play PAL World.
[103:23.48]I've never played it.
[103:24.42]I don't even, I didn't engage with it.
[103:26.82]I don't fucking download.
[103:27.80]I didn't do any, I didn't play it.
[103:33.92]oh the fact that you developed a game to show me guns with and oh my god it's so stupid I just feel like that was the whole point of the game I've never even watched the trailer dude I don't even know what it is
[103:46.98]I heard, yeah, Palworld is a game.
[103:48.40]People were like, if you like Palworld.
[103:50.52]I was like, okay, cool.
[103:51.28]You like Palworld.
[103:52.02]I wasn't like, tell me about it.
[103:52.80]Are you not a gamer?
[103:53.50]Dude, I played three games in 2024.

[104:08.66]Don't be a fucking idiot.
[104:10.32]There's 22,000 people here right now.

[104:56.91]Now, thank you.
[105:03.84]And now Shovel Knight is getting old enough to become vintage in its own right.
[105:09.17]this year a new set of developers released their first game they're just getting started yet they've already created something extraordinary he seems in pain how their talents will shape the industry for the next 10 years I want to comfort him a lot of a lot of people these are the nominees for best debut indie game gigantic run best debut indie best debut indie okay alright

[105:55.45]Whoa, what's that one?
[106:01.13]Satisfactory.

[106:13.03]They all needed this.
[106:15.21]Everybody just got the same exact response of just like everybody knows this music and you're like everybody look down at their phone at the same time.
[106:22.73]Everybody look down at their like tablet at the same time.
[106:25.29]I appreciate that, but none of us are local thunk.
[106:28.17]We are honored, though, to accept this on his behalf.
[106:30.83]And while he's not one for the spotlight, he does like to shine his spotlight on other games that he thinks deserve equal recognition.
[106:37.43]So not only wants to recognize all nominees tonight, but also all indie games that were launched this year that might have flown under the radar.
[106:44.92]Now, what he would like for you is to explore this world of indie games, and I think you'll find a scene of extremely talented and creative developers who are crafting beautiful experience for you to enjoy every single day.
[106:58.31]Now, LocalThunk, I know you're probably thinking if you can give this away to another team that you think deserves it more, but sorry, Arco, he has to take this home.
[107:09.26]So, LocalThonk, you have earned this, and you deserve this.
[107:13.85]And everyone at PlayStack is just so proud of you, of what you've done.
[107:16.95]And I hope that at least tonight, you get to enjoy this.
[107:19.92]Thank you.
[107:20.22]That's an absolute bang.
[107:22.78]I love cards.
[107:23.44]I love cards.
[107:24.84]I love cards.
[107:30.76]I love cards.
[107:32.60]I wish I could send a guy around like that to do things on behalf.
[107:37.06]We know he's not here, but I would like to order a cheese pizza with pepperonis.
[107:43.01]That's my guy.
[107:54.50]Everybody's saying I'm a gambling addict.
[107:56.74]Balatro is like $10.
[107:59.68]You buy it once.
[108:02.58]It's not gambling.
[108:04.59]It's scoring.
[108:07.27]It's trying to get a score with a random number generator, with random... It's not... This game with the evil spirits.
[108:18.50]Why is there a guy in the corner on a computer talking about if Balatro's gambling or not?
[108:23.83]This guy's summoning, like, prime evils.
[108:26.61]The Latro is not gambling, and it cuts to you in the corner.
[108:31.50]Well, that's every streamer dickhead on Earth.
[108:34.82]We're just here to ruin other media.
[108:36.80]Don't you get it?
[108:37.32]Yeah, but it, like, hit me at that moment.
[108:39.52]It felt like you were in the trailer to me.
[108:44.14]You're part of the game now.
[108:47.87]We're just here to be in the corner and ruin everything.
[108:51.49]Yeah, they...
[108:53.29]Lame.
[108:54.05]No, I showed this before.
[108:54.85]I can't remember the name of it.
[108:55.65]It looked really good when they showed it.
[108:57.85]This looks great.
[109:02.88]If you played Dark Souls 1 and you thought to yourself, I wish there were like 17 options in this genre that were all like samurais, what a year to be alive.
[109:12.65]What a time we are in.
[109:14.17]Wow.
[109:15.09]Wait, we're not there yet.
[109:16.55]Oh, yeah.
[109:16.91]You got to wait another two years for that one.
[109:23.76]What a year to be alive in two years.
[109:29.10]That was definitely a good one.
[109:30.54]I had a great time seeing that game this summer out in Osaka.
[109:33.99]I love that franchise and how it combines swordplay and a Japanese dark fantasy setting with some amazing over-the-top enemies, as you saw in that announcement trailer.
[109:41.65]Thank you to Capcom for that.
[109:43.64]Now let's get an update on the first Berserker, Kazan.
[109:50.23]And now, bringing on to the stage, Zorn, Speaker of the Orbs.
[109:55.17]It's like, I'm here, Jeff.
[109:57.41]My new game.
[109:58.97]And I know what demons look like.
[110:01.51]I've seen them.
[110:02.42]All these developers.
[110:04.48]Tell us what's inside that orb.
[110:05.82]We're seeing a lot of crazy spells in there.
[110:07.92]I should unleash this on you.
[110:09.00]Darkness Chaos.
[110:18.63]All these game developers, they make these games.
[110:20.47]I lift this shit.
[110:23.42]Talking about my own life.
[110:40.09]Kazan.
[110:42.11]The last of Bears Don't Care.
[110:44.79]The first?
[110:45.27]I don't know.
[110:46.27]This game makes me sad.
[110:49.48]Imagine there's a guy in the corner talking about how this makes him sad and says the title of the game funny.
[110:55.98]He falls from the ground dead.
[110:57.58]That makes me sad.
[111:10.29]Two Witcher games in one night?
[111:12.89]I don't know what this is.
[111:13.85]Oh, good.
[111:31.36]Wicked fucked up.
[111:36.18]Damn, usually they cut the trailer with the title there.
[111:54.99]They're actually showing it.
[111:57.52]That was a cut to the title screen monster.
[112:00.80]True.
[112:01.26]Okay.
[112:01.94]If something roars, the trailer's over.
[112:25.28]Dude, now it's game over all the way.
[112:29.60]I mean, this is fucking crazy.
[112:37.86]Don't ever taunt before you actually get the kill.
[112:50.79]I mean, that was a really great cinematic.
[112:54.49]that was the first berserker kazan coming in march as you saw yeah it looks really good I just said it makes me sad because it was originally going to be like a dungeon fighter online 2 type of thing oh wow I'm really excited for it they kind of pivoted RPG developed an unreal engine 5 it's coming to Steam console and mobile here's the first ever look oh they're actually going to show it I thought there was a demo
[113:20.44]I remember.
[113:21.16]Oh, no, I don't think this is it.
[113:23.80]Oh, this is not it.
[113:24.36]I don't think this is the same game.
[113:30.21]Yeah, no, I think there's like a full playable demo.
[113:32.27]I saw streamers had played a while back of the last game.
[113:41.31]So have you ever rolled an SSS gotcha before?
[113:44.34]Have you ever got a super, super rare?
[113:48.40]No.
[113:49.76]in anything ever.
[113:52.55]Um, I think I got Onyxia in Hearthstone.
[113:58.25]That's big.
[113:59.05]No, no, it was, it was, um, what was the one legendary that I pulled and I was like, I thought I was the fucking man.
[114:07.86]Uh, Hellscream?
[114:09.44]I think I got the warrior legendary pretty early.
[114:20.89]That's crazy.
[114:23.21]I think I remember you were in the call, and you were like, dude, what, you just pulled Grom?
[114:27.56]And I was like, yeah, and you were making a Warrior deck, and you were like, I need that card, and you wanted to trade it to me.
[114:33.15]For my Ancient deck?
[114:53.59]Magic.
[114:55.19]Lightning.
[114:56.25]Frost.
[114:57.77]Fire.

[116:23.51]Guys, I download anything that just comes onto the PS5 or Xbox store and it's just like, I can just download it.
[116:32.24]If it's at the top of the list on Game Pass, it doesn't even matter.
[116:35.66]It's true.
[116:36.72]Because if you had to click three down... Who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forego their use.
[116:48.67]He has gifted us the means to decipher the code of nature.
[116:54.19]And it's our highest purpose we must strive to accomplish.
[117:00.00]I only answer to this divine calling.
[117:03.58]And you.
[117:05.78]What even is this game gonna be?
[117:25.59]Do you see who's the real beast here?
[117:30.24]I forgot we were watching a dying light, Trevor.
[117:41.36]It built me in a lab to drive this car.

[120:25.39]We are?
[120:25.87]Yeah!
[120:26.87]By watching this show, we're developing an immunity to bad entertainment!
[120:33.23]They never miss, by the way.
[120:34.22]Everyone, all the Muppets are back.
[120:35.58]No, these two don't miss.
[120:51.50]He just called us all losers.
[121:06.34]The fuck is Warren Buffett doing here?
[121:27.24]Hey, how don't you fucking dare get their name out of your mouth.

[121:31.72]Check out this trailer.
[121:33.42]Move to the mountains.

[121:36.92]They are the... I'm just gonna stop talking.
[121:40.47]Hunters follow.
[121:42.65]But now, there's something new on the moon.
[121:47.69]And things will never be the same.
[121:51.35]Harley Quinn?
[121:53.07]To my murder circus.
[121:56.02]Why does he have a murder circus?
[122:00.18]I don't think I would tell anyone.
[122:03.22]You don't welcome people.
[122:05.26]They find that out later.
[122:07.06]Like way later.
[122:08.10]You don't want to tell people that they're coming to a murder circus.
[122:11.24]They come to a regular circus.
[122:12.78]Something just a little bit off about it, right?
[122:15.94]You don't advertise that.
[122:18.10]Anything could happen here in this mysterious night of wonder, murder.
[122:23.00]Welcome to the murder circus.
[122:30.19]Post Malone presents The Candle.
[122:32.25]Watch me do it.
[122:36.39]Oh, I'd buy it.
[122:39.15]Watch me do it.
[122:43.68]Oh, this is the 2K5 genre.
[122:47.44]2K4, 2K5.
[122:49.12]2K25.
[122:50.48]This is a 2K25-like.
[122:55.27]Handheld gaming revolutionized.
[122:57.69]Advanced by AMD.
[123:00.92]You like watching TV shows and movies?
[123:02.44]Dude, when are they going to do like Madden 1995?
[123:04.26]Right?
[123:04.48]Like Madden 95.
[123:04.90]And we go back and it's just the same game.
[123:07.00]They just kind of remaster one of the old ones.
[123:19.03]I feel like people would unironically... That's what it is.
[123:21.21]No, but I mean, like, it's old, like, PlayStation 1 graphics.
[123:23.75]You've played NFL Blitz?
[123:25.95]That's one of the best games ever made.
[123:28.21]Yeah.
[123:30.29]So why'd they start doing 2K5, like?
[123:34.61]I don't know, dude.
[123:35.09]I've been asking this question since WWE 2K14 came out, and you stopped being able to make, like, cartoon characters.
[123:42.26]Think about it.
[123:42.86]Every time there's an exaggerated sports game, we're talking, like, even, like, Tony Hawk Pro Skater.
[123:49.09]uh like NBA hoops on like the SEGA Genesis or whatever it was they're always better I played a game for the 3DO I think it was called jammers and it was unironically some of the most fun I've had in like NBA Jam yeah I played a 3DO one oops squid game oh my god what the fuck
[124:23.93]this was not part of the show yeah they got like Jeff he's like no what the oh no Jeff comes out and he's like he's the mastermind the guy walks out who got the healthcare CEO welcome to the game who is actually in this
[124:48.01]Hello, Game Awards.
[124:49.63]I assume you are all familiar with the Squid Game.
[124:53.07]Because not everyone can physically experience the games, we have created a simulation.
[124:59.41]Unleashed will provide the same highs.
[125:02.95]Or for the unskilled.
[125:05.39]The music changed.

[125:36.57]This is the sneak king.
[125:37.53]Please welcome the founders of Death Row Games, Cordell Broadus and Snoop Dogg.
[126:01.56]I can't believe Snoop Dogg made a game.
[126:03.68]Yeah, Pal World, that was me.
[126:13.04]This year, my father and I launched Death Row Games with the dream of bringing minority stories to the gaming world.
[126:20.74]We intend to create a hip-hop gaming universe that can stand beside some of these nominees tonight.
[126:27.53]Here we are to present Best Ongoing Game.
[126:31.29]really back in the day if you loved the game you wanted more but you had to wait until the next game or as I like to say chill to the next episode that audience just gasped that was like he just slayed them he slayed them all that's the biggest gasp I've heard in five years at this award show that was like hulk saying hulk smash like he did it always stays fresh here are the nominees
[127:02.54]best ongoing game this place it's reshaping reality into a perfect stillness the return of hatred no no no I'm sorry no people the bricks with which it is built
[127:24.08]Together, they fight for freedom.
[127:28.47]I play Path of Exile now.
[127:29.73]My food is better.
[127:30.77]My food tastes better.
[127:31.57]I have better taste.
[127:32.59]I play Path of Exile 2 now.
[127:34.45]I'm better than you.
[127:35.81]No matter what you play, and no matter how much better you are, I think we can all agree, that campaign was awful.
[127:42.47]The Game Award goes to... I don't have a game, cuz.
[127:52.04]Yet.
[127:53.76]oh hail divers too good job what ongoing from like seven months ago
[128:19.28]I mean it's been they've patched it like every month ongoing game for like half a year with like three updates alright well then then you have to go it's either game that comes out and has four updates or game that has 400 updates over 20 years the point isn't that the point yeah but I think there's only like four games that do that
[128:39.47]Well, like, we had Rebecca on stage for Warframe.
[128:42.15]Where's the, like, best ongoing game?
[128:44.13]We've been making Warframe for, like, a decade.
[128:46.71]There are people that aren't as old as Warframe watching this.
[128:51.18]There's not very many games that have been going for that long.
[128:55.32]Best ongoing game?
[128:56.64]Dude, they got, like, two patches.
[129:00.97]They added a mech and the DLC they revealed isn't even out yet.
[129:07.99]You want to give it to Fortnite again?
[129:09.25]Is that what you want to do?
[129:10.89]A Fortnite?
[129:11.65]You want to give it to Fortnite?
[129:12.49]What does that mean?
[129:14.01]What are you saying?
[129:15.13]You want to give the award to Fortnite?
[129:16.27]Is that what you're saying?
[129:18.09]Best ongoing game.
[129:18.93]You want to give it to Fortnite?
[129:20.19]I would give it to a game that has been ongoing.
[129:26.04]I think ongoing means game came out and is continuous developer support with patches and DLC and fixes and content.
[129:34.64]Every single game in the last year or two has had that though.
[129:39.13]But then there are other games that have been ongoing for like a really long time and that's their entire model.
[129:43.57]So why would you take away the platform from them?
[129:45.31]Oh, Ster, it's cooking with it.
[129:47.61]You are not going to want to miss that performance.
[129:50.13]But right now we're thrilled to share the announcement of a brand new game for a beloved game developer.
[130:00.63]What is it?
[130:02.89]Who?
[130:03.71]Never heard of them.
[130:06.47]Oh, that game.
[130:07.67]Never heard of the theater.
[130:08.47]Way too angry playing that.
[130:09.85]That game turned you into a psychopath.
[130:11.76]What?
[130:12.12]You threw a right tantrum.
[130:13.86]No, I didn't.
[130:15.04]You said if I tried to pass you one more onion, you'd... I told you a thousand times, we didn't need any more onions.
[130:19.54]Wait, games called violence?
[130:21.40]Okay, yeah, things did get a little heated.
[130:23.53]Oh, sorry.
[130:24.53]Excuse me.
[130:26.53]What did I miss?
[130:27.85]Shh, it started.
[130:31.96]You're blocking the screen.
[130:33.84]Rude.
[130:34.58]What is going on back there?
[130:36.86]This looks pretty good.
[130:44.71]Oh, this looks wicked.
[130:46.45]Oh, my.
[130:47.75]Oh, it's a two-player!
[130:48.91]And they're showing so much gameplay.
[130:53.81]Oh, no, no, no!
[130:56.11]What's happening?

[131:18.78]Where's an ongoing game?
[131:20.62]Stop.
[131:21.36]We're trying to watch.
[131:48.48]Huh.
[131:50.31]Hmm.
[131:50.73]I mean, whatever that was, I mean, it looked like it's going to be like a play with your friend and... That's a fun one.
[131:57.93]Stage Fright is the next co-op game from the incredible team at Ghost Town Games, the creators of Overcooked.
[132:04.09]I know we've all played over the years, and I am so thrilled to share that with you tonight here on the show.
[132:08.83]And now it's time to head to a familiar place, the home of iconic novels and television shows, and now an upcoming action-adventure game.

[132:41.29]Arise, a knight of Renan's rest.
[132:49.72]Oh, I did not know what this was until right now.
[132:52.64]I feel like this game is coming out like five to seven years too late.
[133:03.91]don't underestimate northern bastards well someone must gather the support of the great houses it looks it looks pretty like it would have to have attaining your father's name will be hard that's my favorite character by the way will be harder it is up to you to decide which is more worth your while modesty won't get you very far in king's landing do at least try to faint a little where are the various fans more familiar

[133:59.25]Yeah, dude, Longclaw's gonna get replaced in the second act with, like, the green sword of fucking culling destruction.
[134:07.21]Because it has 25 more strength than Ironclaw.
[134:10.37]Or Longclaw.
[134:13.29]What's that mean?
[134:14.11]What's the gameplay?

[136:21.99]Okay.
[136:25.34]The only thing I care about is... Wait, did they die?
[136:28.72]Maybe.
[136:30.80]The only thing that I really care about is if I get to hear every time I do a combo with like the same five punches in the game is... That's the only thing I want to hear for like 19 straight hours.
[136:45.87]You've got that combo locked down.
[136:54.10]What's this?
[137:00.25]What the hell just happened?
[137:06.79]They're not doing good.
[137:08.97]It's just a normal guy in a white t-shirt.
[137:14.50]Not so normal, is he?
[137:22.12]I died on Earth 1, but on Earth Xenophoria, I am the savior.

[138:47.20]Oh, the neon lights.
[138:47.92]No, it's okay here because this is a racing game.
[138:51.04]That to me is fine.
[138:54.38]I don't think my two-handed axe should put the light on the back of this car everywhere.
[138:58.98]That's what I mean.
[138:59.50]What?
[139:16.63]what what what what's that like I'm I'm intrigued it was called screamers like there's just cars racing and you got anime eyes inside the car and it's a screamer screamer I have to finish it

[139:48.09]I don't know, like Last of Us Part 2 remastered.
[140:11.16]I think it's the part.
[140:12.04]Part two.
[140:12.48]This always throws me off for some reason.
[140:16.46]Part two.
[140:17.84]That makes it sound like it's a YouTube video to me.
[140:21.40]Like, I'm going to wait for my next, like, 20 minute of, where's, like, part six of, like, the YouTuber Let's Play.
[140:31.81]Um, so... What brings you here tonight?
[140:35.69]Well, I'm just really excited because we're about to present the best adaptation, and we were a part of an adaptation in many ways, and there is no words right now for me to read, so this is all riffing and improv.
[140:50.45]Oh, and it got me thinking.
[140:52.77]I know that while we both spent a lot of time with Ellie, we heard so, so many lame puns.
[140:57.95]Oh, God, so many lame puns.
[140:59.93]Someone just said, it's arcane, get it over with.
[141:01.79]You know, actually, there was one.
[141:03.05]Did she ever tell you the one about tripping over your girlfriend's bra?
[141:08.10]No, not this one again.
[141:09.16]Yeah, it was a real booby trap.
[141:11.82]Oh, yeah.
[141:14.12]Hey, but hey, have you ever heard the one about trying to catch some fog?
[141:18.75]That hurt the audience.
[141:20.09]Did they take damage?
[141:23.16]Yeah.
[141:23.34]The health bar went down.
[141:24.02]We've talked about when you watch a movie, you take damage during some movies and TV shows.
[141:28.70]If you take enough damage, you have to turn it off.
[141:42.25]I was trying to watch this show recently and I was actually counting all of the minus ones and how many chances I was giving it yeah it was actual like health damage no no it's real I remember I took real I took real health bar damage when I watched um kooby Halloween I I could feel my health bar going down actually like scooby do Halloween special what no wait what is knuckles wait what what
[142:06.69]Yeah, it's like Red Sonic.
[142:08.47]The Red Sonic is usually on the top square.
[142:10.60]Oh shit, my computer's crashing.
[142:12.92]Oh, good.
[142:13.60]My computer's crashing.
[142:17.80]Got him.
[142:19.70]Wait, hold on.
[142:22.82]Oh, I think we're good.
[142:24.85]That was weird.
[142:26.61]Whoa, you had a... Oh, I don't know.
[142:29.21]You had a pretty hot take on Fallout.
[142:34.21]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[142:35.05]Do you mean...
[142:36.20]Don't mean to pull you out into the open here.
[142:38.56]OK, wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[142:41.46]Are you talking about?
[142:45.06]Making sure that, like for instance, like it like when we talk about like the X-Men animated series, X-Men 95, whatever.
[142:50.86]It's like a means to make sure you hear.
[142:56.92]Like of half a dozen times I've spent most of the evening, right?
[143:00.56]They made the whole show so they could say war never changes.
[143:05.02]He didn't see it though.
[143:05.72]I thought it was pretty good.
[143:06.78]I didn't see it.
[143:07.34]Apparently the people are not happy about this one.
[143:09.22]They're saying Arcane should have won.
[143:10.25]Yeah, I wasn't paying attention to Arcane.
[143:14.45]It was on the list.
[143:15.95]Arcane should have won.
[143:31.18]Last but not least, I want to thank Todd.
[143:34.20]Todd and the extraordinary team at Bethesda, who were absolutely the most incredible collaborators you could possibly imagine.
[143:39.86]Thank you.
[143:44.97]Not an adaptation, though.
[143:46.05]I, too, have to thank our cast and crew, everybody involved in this show, led by my friend and the incredible Jonah Nolan.
[143:53.13]What, like a chameleon?
[143:56.41]And really to everybody who's worked on Fallout over the years, everybody at Bethesda that I've worked with on Fallout for 20 years now.
[144:04.79]It's been incredible.
[144:05.70]We are so blessed with the best fans.
[144:08.26]I think you just want him to stick his tongue out and be like, yeah!
[144:13.76]Like, yeah, motherfucker!
[144:15.41]Got another one, man!
[144:25.05]Congratulations to Fallout.
[144:26.59]Next up, we head to the year 2097 and the co-op heist FPS Den of Wolves from Ulf Andersen, the creator of Payday 1 and 2 and GTFO.
[144:35.80]Here's your first look at the gameplay.
[144:42.32]A techno thriller co-op heist FPS.
[144:47.19]I'm seeing a few neon lights.
[144:50.23]No, it hasn't.
[144:51.13]Not yet.
[144:56.96]I like in the future when all your buildings look like they're batteries.
[145:00.92]Yeah, they're like sticks of RAM.
[145:05.83]Like every single city in the future looks like the inside of your computer.
[145:09.07]Yeah, why?
[145:09.51]True, we need to build better...
[145:21.38]We just need to build better.
[145:23.00]We need to build better, you know.
[145:24.70]We need to build this.
[145:25.55]We need to get back on track.
[145:31.11]We just need to do better.
[145:32.31]You know, as people.
[145:38.33]Put a tree somewhere.
[145:39.65]Uh...
[145:58.48]Early access win.
[146:01.75]That didn't have a date.
[146:02.77]30 seconds.
[146:10.19]this is new eridu the last city on the planet dude I want to give like an expiration on a game you know what I mean like give it like milk like oh yeah by the way this game is expiring in 2029 it's like whoa what the is that mean even if it's not coming out is inevitable expiring then on our own terms
[146:30.59]It's going, it's going rotten, dude.
[146:33.36]And in 2029, like the day after, the day after the expiration date of the game, shit gets disgusting, rotten looking.
[146:39.78]Like the screen gets red and stuff.
[146:41.37]And it's like gross.
[146:42.15]All of the milk becomes creamier and gross.
[146:47.15]All the food is decaying.
[146:48.51]This game is aging poorly.
[147:13.01]There's all this dramatic stuff going on.
[147:14.55]This is your bard build in Neverwinter trying to fix it.
[147:18.56]No, my bard in Neverwinter literally just whistled and then got fucking killed by goblins.
[147:24.28]I thought it was the worst game ever made.
[147:25.78]I was like, this is the worst game ever made, and I just fucking uninstalled it.
[147:28.91]I didn't understand the concept of what D&D was.
[147:31.21]I was like, this is the worst game I've ever played.
[147:33.69]I just didn't get it.
[147:41.46]I love the concept of just like not getting something to that degree and like being upset about it and writing a review that just like... Dude, I felt that way about Dark Souls when I first played it.
[147:57.88]I was like, this game sucks.
[147:59.34]Absolute asshole.
[148:00.22]This game sucks.
[148:01.58]I was like, this game is terrible.
[148:03.68]People like this game.
[148:04.70]I like just didn't understand what it was trying to do.
[148:09.74]I was angry that people liked it.
[148:12.07]Yeah.
[148:12.73]Actually, no, I think I remember you being angry.
[148:15.05]I was like, this game Dark Souls, dude, this game sucks.
[148:17.55]This game fucking sucks balls, man.
[148:19.05]I feel like your full video of Dark Souls you made was like the actual tutorial.
[148:25.53]No, it was.
[148:26.01]Like not even a boss.
[148:27.51]Like you did not break out of the press like this to roll.
[148:32.07]Yeah, I did not even get past the tutorial.
[148:34.55]It's like the Asylum Demon and stuff.
[148:36.23]And I'm like, this game sucks.
[148:38.11]I think there was a Dark Souls 2 interview and you like walked down to Majula for the first time and you're like, alright, cool.
[148:44.25]Yeah.
[148:47.53]And then I finally got it.
[148:48.77]I understood what the point of the game was.
[148:51.99]And I was like, this is my favorite thing ever.
[148:53.47]I think you're just not getting games where like goblins fight you.
[148:57.87]Like, why wouldn't I be friends with the goblins?
[149:02.01]I have to get it.
[149:04.83]And Neverwinter, I did not get to a point of anger.
[149:28.34]Isn't this an ongoing game too?
[149:29.70]This thing's going.
[149:31.69]Alright, here we go.
[149:32.67]Last month, Snoop Dogg simultaneously took over for Red and Times Square with one performance.
[149:39.02]Well, tonight, he's here at the Game Awards to finish the fight to help us celebrate our 10th anniversary like no one else can, debuting a brand new song from his new album, Missionary.
[149:51.38]My computer's crashing again.
[149:55.95]Why is my computer crashing?
[149:58.79]Okay, if my... If my stream dies... Uh... Then I... Are you streaming right now?
[150:07.56]Yeah.
[150:08.36]Everybody go to Ster if my stream dies.
[150:10.10]Because it's close.
[150:12.06]This is close.
[150:12.56]It's happening.
[150:13.18]It's happening.
[150:16.72]I don't... This is an interesting way to watch this.
[150:23.76]Oh, no.
[150:24.28]Snoop showed up and we're good.
[150:28.18]he's um yep well didn't they didn't they already do like game of the year no they haven't done game of the year which one was the big one that uh astrobot one that was action adventure
[150:54.15]think they're gonna do game of the year in the middle of the show before the month just felt so dramatic because uh kojima like introduced it for so long and then he never even dropped a trailer
[151:13.48]I don't know what it felt like it had all of the games on the list that are also the game of the year one probably that's probably accurate it looked like the same list it just didn't have like Balatro are you figuring out award shows we're satisfactory if you're having a good time tonight for best ongoing game that released this year and was fantastic yes alright y'all
[151:40.42]Didn't Satisfactory come out like in 2018?
[151:45.85]Early access.
[151:46.99]It had its official release this year.
[151:48.81]Oh, it did 1.0 this year.
[151:50.03]Okay.
[151:50.84]Yeah.
[151:51.96]From the devs of Goat Simulator.
[151:54.32]Such a classic.
[151:55.06]Yeah.
[152:05.19]they should give an award anybody right now who is saying shut up guys who came to a Twitch stream of gamers to watch a game awards to want to hear Snoop Dogg is like seven layers down of where you're supposed to be you had every opportunity to get off where your interests were freaking out in the audience
[152:39.91]I just heard somebody say, Ster.
[152:41.49]Shut up.
[152:44.47]You can't silence me.
[152:47.36]Is it because I'm not on camera?
[152:52.28]See, now we can talk.
[152:53.20]Silence him?
[152:53.70]Why?
[153:05.04]You want me to silence them?
[153:07.64]If Ster has one fan, that is me.
[153:09.93]It's me.
[153:10.49]I'm Ster.
[153:12.21]It's me.
[153:12.65]Well, you didn't want to see two aging men complain about neon colors?
[153:27.37]There's too many planets in the solar system.
[153:31.52]Back in my day, we only had two.
[153:33.94]Don't you think it's getting kind of fucked up that they keep being planets?
[153:37.70]Like, there should just be eight of them.
[153:40.14]I don't care about any of the other ones.
[153:41.48]There's other galaxies out there.
[153:43.26]They're trying to do another one?
[153:46.21]Wait, they got a whole other galaxy?
[153:47.73]Like, there's Andromeda and there's, you know, whatever that is.
[153:51.91]Why did I go to science class if they're just going to change it all?
[153:55.78]Just shove that whole fucking solar system up your ass.
[153:59.22]Protons, electrons.
[154:02.11]Now it's all quantum.
[154:03.69]What happened?
[154:06.55]Do you think they're ever going to add the Three Stooges into Fortnite?
[154:10.05]Be honest with me.
[154:27.40]when they do three stooges remastered and it's like will ferrell they already did a three stooges remastered and will ferrell was not in it oh did they yeah Larry David's in it as a nun I swear to you that's a real movie I've I've missed this what's it called the three stooges remade oh wait wait
[154:56.91]This is sounding familiar.
[154:58.45]Yeah, because it's the Three Stooges.
[155:00.89]They've remade the Three Stooges.
[155:04.43]Will's... What's his name?
[155:06.18]Will Sasso is Curly.
[155:12.08]Didn't you eat a shoe because of that?
[155:14.76]Okay.
[155:15.62]It's going to be three stooges.
[155:17.58]They're going to be black and white.
[155:19.08]It's going to be like, it's me, Moe here.
[155:20.78]And then you're going to be able to stance switch.
[155:25.83]So Moe is a little bit faster, has a little bit faster shooting speed.
[155:29.07]And then Curly has more health.
[155:31.13]And a paintbrush comes out when you click Curly.
[155:35.05]Like, let's say it's a cue on your board.
[155:37.09]A paintbrush goes like, swap, swap, swap.
[155:39.90]And black and white paint paints Curly.
[155:42.75]Fucking whoa.
[155:44.43]Larry is the wild card.
[155:45.55]Larry can go either way.
[155:46.35]He can do damage.
[155:48.15]He can heal.
[155:49.31]And it's a stance switching mechanic.
[155:51.64]By the way, Epic, if you put this in the game, I want fucking 40% of the money.
[155:57.92]Wait, that should go to the estate.
[155:59.56]That should go to the fucking Three Stooges estate first, right?
[156:02.52]No, I think that you get 40.
[156:04.02]Do I just get 40% of that?
[156:08.17]Yeah.
[156:08.69]Developers get one.
[156:11.25]They gotta share it.
[156:13.63]I came up with the idea to put the Three Stooges in the game.
[156:16.09]So therefore the Three Stooges don't... The actual estate that owns the rights don't get the money for that.
[156:20.93]I mean, I came up with it.
[156:22.31]I mean, I decided that there was going to be a paintbrush.
[156:26.97]Oh, that's so dumb.
[156:29.27]That's so fucking dumb, I love it.
[156:31.11]What are you smoking this time?
[156:31.97]Okay.
[156:43.61]Do you, like, whenever I watch a reality show or any show where someone's playing a game, I'm so interested to see what game they're playing.
[156:51.05]I feel like it helps you define who, like, you think the person is.
[156:54.07]I can help you here.
[156:55.74]Anytime you see a computer screen that's in a commercial or a TV show, usually, it's usually just, like, for some reason, a giant inflated version of the iPhone menu.
[157:04.72]No, no, I'm talking, like, sometimes, like, reality shows where, like, a real reality, fake real person...
[157:11.84]they're talking about like oh yeah he's a gamer and then they show like three second clip of them playing a game and you can create your whole like idea of them based around whatever game they're playing and you need to it's usually blurred and you have to like I've seen like four of them recently where the game was blurred and it was so obviously league of legends because like they're just in mid lane and it's like oh he's a league player like that sets all of my expectations
[157:41.58]It needs to be, well, I mean, I don't know.
[157:42.92]What's this?
[157:43.28]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[157:43.86]So your game of the year actually is satisfactory.
[157:46.90]What's your runner up?
[158:08.32]Music and score in video games isn't just the soundtrack of our journey.
[158:12.54]It's the racing heartbeat of every battle, the haunting echo of every failure, and the soul of every victory.
[158:19.60]From soaring orchestral pieces to intimate melodies that break our hearts.
[158:24.85]The right music makes games unforgettable.
[158:27.79]Here are the nominees for best score and music.
[158:30.95]I'm actually curious about this.
[158:32.23]Best score and music.
[158:35.37]Astro Bot again.
[158:42.77]I kind of feel like we've already heard all those songs, though.
[159:02.46]Metaphor is going to win.
[159:03.56]Metaphor.
[159:04.78]And the Game Award goes to... Final Fantasy.
[159:14.66]The only thing I'll say about this is what I just said.
[159:17.44]Isn't this just or isn't it?
[159:19.48]Did they remake the songs or is it original?
[159:21.50]Is it a remaster?
[159:22.30]What's going on?
[159:23.10]It's a remake, right?
[159:26.82]I don't know.
[159:27.18]I was in the sauce.
[159:28.02]I mean, those songs are all incredible.
[159:37.68]But aren't they mostly from like 20 years ago?
[159:42.36]best ongoing songs best ongoing soundtrack I mean it would be Final Fantasy that would win every year it's made I mean the the latest Final Fantasy absolute bangers the the the battle music some of the best I've ever heard I'm so excited I love the battle music in the new Final Fantasy
[160:16.97]It's truly an honor to receive this award here at the Game Awards and I'd like to take this moment to express my sincere thanks to our development team that helped create this wonderful game together.
[160:24.48]It's hard.
[160:43.41]I was going to say this before, being a translator, it's like if somebody's talking, you need to remember everything that they're saying and the inflection and how they're going to present it.
[160:53.51]I get the notepad.
[160:54.47]I don't know how people are up there without them.
[160:56.10]That's actually an unbelievable skill.
[160:57.80]People will talk for like four minutes.
[161:01.68]This is my very first time attending the Game Awards here today, and I'm so honored and pleased to receive this award.
[161:07.36]I feel like you bring her up there as a translator, and then you really mix it up, and you start speaking like French.
[161:13.90]You speak a different language.
[161:14.84]She can't do it, and she's flustered.
[161:16.46]She's like, wait, wait, I...
[161:18.58]That would be great if she was writing stuff down, like, that's alright, motherfucker, I know them all.
[161:22.82]Yeah, I got that one.
[161:25.75]She just leans into the mic and goes, I know them all.
[161:27.43]All of them.
[161:27.93]And I'm equally pleased today to be able to finally announce the PC version of the game.
[161:43.64]It's almost like your brain needs to operate at the same level in two different complete parallel lines.
[161:49.45]That's like an incredible skill.
[161:51.33]Thank you.
[162:19.61]What's next?
[162:20.47]Oh, Shadow the Hedgehog.
[162:21.57]Is it?
[162:21.93]It is.
[162:22.15]It better be a racing game.
[162:23.51]It is.
[162:52.90]Oh, well.
[162:55.74]We're just, we're making it.
[162:57.92]Yeah, that's all you get.
[162:58.88]There will be much more to share about Sonic Racing Crossworld in 2025.
[163:03.83]I've had the pleasure of playing it, and trust me, it is a ton of fun.
[163:08.07]Next year, fans will get to experience the Mafia franchise like never before in Mafia the Old Country, an origin story set in the brutal criminal underworld of 1900 Sicily.
[163:18.77]Tonight, we have the world's first look at this cinematic action game.
[163:26.46]I'll probably play this.
[163:27.12]I lived this.
[163:27.52]Turning this one up.
[163:29.30]I could see New York from where I was in New Jersey.
[163:35.55]This is me.
[163:52.65]Yourself.
[163:54.65]Your life.
[163:56.37]To this family.
[164:07.21]I do.
[164:08.67]I haven't been paying attention.
[164:11.63]This is not New York.
[164:13.89]It's not actually.
[164:15.47]This is not New York.
[164:17.27]This is Sicily.
[164:20.39]These words.
[164:25.52]I love when it's you that it happens, dude.
[164:30.00]You know what I mean?
[164:38.88]I love that.
[164:41.30]Wait, wait.
[164:41.88]They were doing it over there?
[164:44.00]Oh, the old country.
[164:47.31]Yeah, we're the new Americas.
[164:49.75]That's why.
[164:50.19]Okay.
[164:53.46]I mean, I'm going to play it.

[165:34.44]Such an unbelievable amount of times.

[165:38.02]It's- it's- it's- It is- Yes.
[165:40.02]It is shitting heroin.
[165:44.88]Like there's nothing that'll ever replace that.
[165:46.86]It is like the perfect activity.
[165:52.45]Yeah, my game of the year is perfect to play when you gotta fucking take a dump.
[165:58.18]It is the most addicting, most fun thing to do while you're shitting.
[166:04.73]And on top of all the other things at the time to play it.
[166:07.41]I'm just telling you.

[174:02.56]Wait, do you pick these?
[174:13.09]Wait, I think you pick these on the screen.
[174:15.77]Wait.
[174:16.09]Yeah.
[174:17.49]Yeah.
[174:19.41]That's how these games work.
[174:21.76]Oh, I thought this was an ad for a TV show.
[174:25.36]Okay, this is a game.

[174:56.40]That was Dispatch, and now to present our next award, please welcome a Game Award winner from last year, he's a visionary creator, Sam Lake from Remedy.
[175:22.96]I was back at the Game Awards.
[175:25.27]It felt like a loop.
[175:27.59]I'd lost track of how many times I'd been here, how many awards I'd won.
[175:34.09]Something kept nagging at me, forcing me to snap out of my reverie.
[175:40.17]I was here to do a job, hand out the award for best narrative.
[175:46.27]That was a good transition too.
[176:14.94]Here are the nominees for best narrative.
[176:20.34]That was, I like that.
[176:21.28]That was fun.
[176:21.72]Best narrative.
[176:23.60]You here to pick a fight?
[176:24.92]Why not take us on?
[176:26.44]It's upon us.
[176:28.10]I'm sending you to Hawaii.
[176:29.85]Someone there who wants to meet you.
[176:31.67]You ready for this, Kasuga?
[176:32.75]This is the way of the real world.
[176:35.19]I will show you a world with honor.
[176:38.21]That game looks kind of cool.
[176:41.45]The metaphor one.
[176:42.25]I'm looking more and more into wanting to look into that one.
[176:45.31]That guy was like, this is what it's like in the real world.
[176:47.69]And he's fighting skeletons.
[176:51.45]Well, there you go.
[176:56.75]What kind of game is this?
[177:05.16]This looks sick.
[177:07.56]I'm getting into this.
[177:08.64]I want to play this.
[177:09.26]Wait, Power World had guns?
[177:11.36]Dude, Power World had guns?
[177:12.58]I'm hearing a lot about this game.
[177:13.78]What are you doing it?
[177:17.08]I'm starting to understand that I'm the target demographic for the Game Awards.
[177:20.75]Yeah.
[177:21.51]It's me.
[177:32.23]He lives under a rock?
[177:34.60]I just don't...
[177:53.61]So first of all, I think it's fantastic.
[177:55.69]I feel so happy and so honored to be up here on stage at this incredible show.
[177:59.71]I think storytelling is a really important part of the game.
[178:03.15]Do you think the translators feel like they're receiving the reward?
[178:06.36]We focus on making stories throughout our career.
[178:09.52]And knowing that we've been honored here in this way today is really honoring.
[178:15.58]So additionally, I'd like to thank everybody at the studio who has helped make this game.
[178:20.28]Without their help, we could not have done this.
[178:21.78]So thank you guys so much.
[178:25.29]Thank you.
[178:26.93]Thank you very much.
[178:30.11]Yeah, he's like walking away smiling.
[178:31.47]I did it.
[178:34.61]Got that one.
[178:36.91]Metaphor just is Persona.
[178:40.66]Is it a turn-based game?
[178:42.68]Turn-based game?
[178:43.26]Congratulations, Ashino Sojima.
[178:45.28]That's really amazing.
[178:46.84]It's like Tetris, dude.
[178:48.92]I love these moments where we're able to pass the torch from a previous winner to a brand new honoree.
[178:52.73]Thanks to Sam Lake as well for coming out for that.
[178:55.54]Alright, well before we get to game of the year, we do have one last very special announcement to share with you.
[179:01.53]This year, the stars align for some very magical things to happen at our anniversary.
[179:07.17]Things that might not have ever seemed a possibility.
[179:10.51]If you truly love video games like I do, this moment is for all of us.
[179:19.13]This seems entirely possible.
[179:24.52]I'm turning this one up.
[180:17.36]Okami?
[180:20.86]Oh, shit!
[180:26.02]Wow, okay.
[180:27.12]That's pretty cool.
[180:30.49]It's not Okami 2, it's Okami sequel.
[180:35.67]Okami sequel.
[180:39.99]Damn.
[180:40.89]Alright, that's unexpected.
[180:48.39]Oh, shit.
[180:49.99]That's actually kind of a big deal.
[180:57.53]Oh, my God, what an amazing moment, together again, Takeuchi-san and Kamiya-san and his new studio that we're also announcing, Clovers.
[181:05.46]Production is just about to begin on the Okami sequel, and I am beyond honored we could share this very special announcement here at our 10th anniversary celebration.
[181:14.20]Thank you to Capcom and the Fujimoto family for this anniversary gift.
[181:18.32]Still to come, Game of the Year, but right now, here's some much-awaited news on the release timing for Crimson Desert from Pearl Abyss.
[181:27.88]the game might be real continent this one this is um it might be real uh I mean it might be it's like by black desert people but now the desert's crimson I think I've been hearing about this for like seven years there are beings who brought chaos
[181:54.84]Why does it look so strange?
[181:56.78]Every time they show it, it looks like it's... Alpha.
[182:02.79]So it's in, like, the Black Desert universe?
[182:07.99]Or is it, like, a sequel or something?
[182:09.89]I forget.
[182:10.21]I think it's changed a few times.
[182:13.28]I forgore.
[182:41.40]Dragon.
[182:42.08]Dragon.
[182:42.38]It's going to be a Witcher-esque.
[182:45.36]A Witcher-like.
[182:46.30]Well, there's your release date.
[182:49.12]Oh, no.
[182:49.24]Whoa.
[183:09.65]You're like two and a half seconds ahead of me.
[183:12.35]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[183:13.97]I'll make my reactions two and a half seconds slower.
[183:18.23]But then everyone's going to think that I'm not as quick with it.
[183:22.43]Yeah.
[183:23.55]Oh, I see.
[183:25.77]I saw Fortnite Hardcore Classic came up.
[183:43.46]Were you first person Fortnite-ing?
[183:47.52]I don't know.
[183:48.02]I feel like they should have explained, like, what?
[183:52.72]It's like, it's... I can't believe that Fortnite releasing as like a fucking wave defense game turned into what it is now.
[184:03.47]You would never, if it had a crystal ball, you never would have known that.
[184:05.55]Back to your wizard days.
[184:14.76]And even worse, I heard a Final Fantasy game is up for Game of the Year.
[184:19.99]Well, my Final Fantasy is for this show to be over.
[184:23.70]Yeah, right?
[184:26.28]And I also heard they nominated DLC for Game of the Year.
[184:31.55]That's like giving a lifetime achievement award to pre-ordered bonuses.
[184:38.66]Hey, look.
[184:39.80]I think the show's about to get better.
[184:42.04]Oh, yeah.
[184:42.92]Time to watch Keeley make a fool of himself again.
[184:45.54]Exactly.
[184:46.58]I love this show.
[184:47.66]More Jeff Keeley.
[184:48.72]Yeah, what a moron.
[184:50.00]Look at him.
[184:50.68]Give it.
[184:51.22]Bring it to us.
[184:52.73]What if he was like, shut the fuck up?
[184:58.13]How dare you?
[184:58.75]You've been giving me shit all night.
[185:00.67]They didn't prepare that.
[185:02.04]That's just like two people showed up and just started doing it.
[185:15.63]the studios and developers for helping us make it happen.
[185:18.27]So I just want to say thank you to so many of you here in the person who have believed in me along the way and trusted our team to create this event.
[185:25.13]And thank you to the fans around the world for taking your time to watch this show every year.
[185:29.24]Gaming's greatest days are ahead.
[185:31.06]We wouldn't want it any other way, Jeff.
[185:33.08]Where this industry will be for our 20th anniversary.
[185:35.46]And we're going to keep working as hard as we can to keep the Game Awards and the game industry growing around the world.
[185:45.50]Now, because tonight is such a special show, I'll be here every year.
[185:53.04]One more thing.
[185:56.76]One of our industry's most celebrated developers has been hard at work in complete secrecy building a brand new original world unlike anything they've done before.
[186:07.81]What you're about to see is captured entirely in the game engine.
[186:12.46]We're happy to share with you tonight's final world premiere at the 10th anniversary of the Game Awards.
[186:18.80]Through the Viewfinder of my camcorder.
[186:21.70]I got to see what they were working on.
[186:27.65]Dude, this is their moment.
[186:45.86]Good.
[186:46.46]Good.
[187:13.51]Oh.
[187:58.35]Jordan?
[187:59.25]Tell me something good.
[188:00.81]Well, you're right, it checks out.
[188:02.55]He's hiding out around the Sympyrean moon.
[188:05.99]Excellent.
[188:07.19]How is that excellent?
[188:08.55]He's next to fucking Sympyrean.
[188:10.55]No one has left that planet in over 600 years.
[188:13.30]Anyone who even flies close to it has never heard from him again.
[188:16.12]Superstitions.
[188:17.16]No, no, no.
[188:18.88]Superstitions are the crazy rumors about what happened on that planet.
[188:21.38]These, these are facts.
[188:24.02]You worry too much.
[188:25.22]You know what I worry just the right amount.
[188:27.57]I say we wait for him to leave or how about we find a new lead he's not worth it I'm wasting my time aren't I can you please blame him I don't need another hunter swooping in who is swooping no one is crazy enough to go there oh he clearly is he is clearly desperate and so am I so claim him or I will find another agent
[188:58.40]I'll do all your fucking shit.
[188:59.79]Okay.
[189:00.15]Alright.
[189:00.53]You know what?
[189:01.85]There.
[189:02.21]You're the boss.
[189:09.09]Thank you.
[189:11.34]Listen, kid.
[189:16.32]I'll see you on the other side.
[189:43.29]Sony always did make high quality CD players.
[189:47.34]I have seen four different advertisements.
[189:50.12]It was a Porsche spaceship we got Adidas on with a Sony player.
[189:53.67]I think there was one more.
[190:35.42]Intergalactic, intergalactic heretic prophecy.
[190:43.05]We will give our prophecy 2026 summer.
[190:50.01]It captured in-game engine.
[190:51.63]Okay, can the game engine open MP4 files that have been pre-edited?
[190:58.69]Well, they just didn't say the computer it was being ran on.
[191:01.61]I'm also happy to share the trailer you just saw and the full game will feature a new original score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.
[191:11.58]Captured with a NASA-level computer.
[191:13.85]Doesn't Naughty Dog always make really polished graphical games?
[191:17.37]They usually run pretty well, don't they?
[191:19.35]Yeah, no, they make good games.
[191:20.45]I just, um... Show me the gameplay.
[191:21.65]Show me the game.
[191:22.51]Where the game's at.
[191:23.19]Alright, here we go.
[191:39.63]It's time for the game of the year.
[191:43.24]I realize you guys have been sitting here for over three hours, but I still have some time credits from last year to cash in.
[191:51.38]So it turns out that not only will I be the one who will know as first which game wins tonight, but I actually also know which game is going to win next year, the year after, and the year after.
[192:02.97]Now, how do I know this?
[192:04.01]Well, an oracle told me.
[192:05.57]She said, change is coming.
[192:08.19]It's a modern Oracle, so they made me sign an NDA.
[192:11.87]But I trust all of you.
[192:13.87]I know you can keep a secret.
[192:14.91]You will never leak it.
[192:16.39]The Oracle told me that the game of the year 2025 was going to be made by a studio who found the formula to make it up here on stage.
[192:24.82]It's stupidly simple, but somehow it keeps on getting lost.
[192:29.67]Studio made their game because they wanted to make a game that they wanted to play themselves.
[192:33.96]They created it because it hadn't been created before.
[192:37.46]They didn't make it to increase market share.
[192:39.26]They didn't make it to serve as a brand.
[192:42.26]They didn't have to meet arbitrary sales targets or fear being laid off if they didn't meet those targets.
[192:49.27]And furthermore, the people in charge forbade them from cramming the game with anything whose only purpose was to increase revenue and didn't serve the game design.
[192:59.03]They didn't treat their developers like numbers on a spreadsheet.
[193:02.23]They didn't treat their players as users to exploit.
[193:06.30]And they didn't make decisions they knew were short-sighted in function of a bonus or politics.
[193:12.56]They knew that if you put the game and the team first, the revenue will follow.
[193:17.10]They were driven by idealism and wanted players to have fun.
[193:20.24]And they realized that if the developers didn't have fun, nobody was going to have any fun.
[193:24.73]They understood the value of respect, that if they treated their developers and players well, those same developers and players would forgive them when things didn't go as planned.
[193:34.53]But above all,
[193:35.89]They cared about their game because they loved games.
[193:39.48]It's really that simple, said the Oracle.
[193:42.48]Winning Game of the Year turned out to be a life-changing event for us.
[193:47.10]It was an amazing thing.
[193:48.71]To those who will win Game of the Year 2024, you have no idea what's waiting for you.
[193:54.01]It's an incredible honor, and you're in for a heck of a ride.
[193:57.48]Now, remember, should you be told to wrap it up for tonight, you can always come back next year and chat for three minutes, okay?
[194:04.96]So, now, to pay tribute to the nominees for Game of the Year once again, Lorna Balfe and the TGA Orchestra.
[194:13.29]I actually want to listen to this one, because what's the Ballotro one going to be like?
[194:17.69]I am fucking pumped for this one.
[194:20.27]Actually, that could be crazy.
[194:25.77]I hope they bring out like a clown runs out.
[194:27.54]They might.
[195:29.61]Ooh, nice.
[195:39.50]Her hand's stuck!
[195:41.04]Help!
[195:58.53]I am asshole bot.
[196:09.53]This is 0.0 on the joke scale for me.
[196:14.60]I don't know you laugh.
[196:15.92]I don't know.
[196:49.54]I mean, if Balatro wins, that's a pretty major achievement.
[196:53.21]I don't think they're going to, but it would be wild if they did.
[197:15.38]They had a 3D printed trumpet.
[197:18.52]dude balatro just tried to do one thing and just make a fun game and it was a total success it's just a fun ass game man it's just a good ass game you know what I mean that's all it wants it's just that's all it just wants to be a good ass game remember when Slay the Spire one game of the year and was on the game awards
[197:53.89]And the game of the year is... Astro Bot!
[198:03.51]Astro Bot.
[198:05.13]This game is that good?
[198:06.75]I have to play it.
[198:08.44]The underdog.
[198:14.58]This apparently is more fun than Alatro, Elden Ring.
[198:19.26]This apparently is the greatest game ever.
[198:22.32]I have to play it.
[198:23.02]I have to try it now.
[198:28.10]I don't know, but this is yeah, that's.
[198:37.73]Well, they took something and they made something fucking great.
[198:39.93]Apparently that's crazy.
[198:42.59]I definitely play it now.
[198:45.81]Oh good on them.
[198:50.75]They took a PlayStation mascot character and they made a better game than Elden Ring, apparently.
[198:55.81]Like, that's some good... No, I feel like they actually tried their hand at, like, a Super Mario world and they killed it.
[199:03.49]Like, they actually... Yeah.
[199:06.30]Everything I've seen from it looks like every area is super well polished and feels super good.
[199:11.50]Good on them.
[199:13.12]I'm excited to try it now.
[199:14.76]I guess I'll have to listen to the... Well, you have another game you have to play first.
[199:20.03]That's true.
[199:21.58]Wow.
[199:23.60]Nothing can prepare you for that.
[199:24.96]Thank you so much.
[199:26.02]Altro is still number one for me.
[199:28.71]Back in Japan, all 65 of them right now, they're crying.
[199:31.59]So please, a round of applause for them.
[199:35.11]Thank you.
[199:39.05]It's unironically good.
[199:40.13]Chat's just mad.
[199:40.93]I think all the games up there were good.
[199:44.33]When I thought about why this game gave people joy and smiles on their faces, I think it came down to the people... Hey, Chat, your favorite game is still your favorite game.
[199:55.26]When I think of the team, it's the amount of generosity they gave.
[199:58.20]They put the user first, always.
[200:00.38]Never thought about any calculation.
[200:03.06]It was just about the kids, especially.
[200:05.12]No, it's not.
[200:05.62]My opinion was warped.
[200:06.16]They got me.
[200:06.68]Because we had this huge privilege to be potentially the first game to be in the hands of children, and we know what it means very much.
[200:15.05]So Team Asobi, really, from the bottom of our heart, well done and thank you so much.
[200:20.62]Now, thank you.
[200:22.46]No, good for them.
[200:23.18]That's a good approach.
[200:25.50]It's just like, just try to make something that's good.
[200:27.24]I have to thank a few more people because a lot of people contributed to this game.
[200:29.92]Of course, in SAE and PlayStation 5 Mini, you know, Herman who gave the studio a chance and Scott Roddy who really believed in Astro even before we did.
[200:43.51]Ken Channel Marketing and many, many other people that I'm not mentioning.
[200:47.58]Astro Bot is full of 30 years of PlayStation history, and actually a lot of people in this room tonight gave their characters their IP without asking anything in return, just because they cared about celebrating 30 years.
[201:00.35]So to them as well, from the bottom of our heart, thank you so much.
[201:06.89]And then last and not least, and you want to stay for this one because I didn't plan to say it, but I'm going to say it anyway.
[201:15.31]You know, platformers, you know, PlayStation 30 years, and we made a platformer, which is great.
[201:20.83]It's very nostalgic and fresh at the same time.
[201:22.97]But let's not forget that even before PlayStation, there were people making platformers.
[201:28.21]I remember I was a kid in 1989, Christmas, and I got a gray box.
[201:32.56]There was a game packed in.
[201:33.58]It was called Super Mario Brothers, and it was really, really great.
[201:37.26]That's right.
[201:40.40]We are in Japan.
[201:41.22]We're in Tokyo.
[201:42.64]They are in Kyoto.
[201:44.00]But I want to pay tribute to the company who really put like platformers and showed us innovation and quality consistently and inspired us to actually make the game that we made.
[201:54.56]So that's also, and I've managed not to mention them, have you noticed?
[201:58.76]But you all know who they are.
[201:59.84]And many other companies have been inspired over the years.
[202:02.04]So that's really, really important.
[202:04.02]And we want to pay tribute to them tonight.
[202:07.11]Talk about Crash Bandicoot.
[202:08.47]What the fuck, dude?
[202:09.85]It's amazing.
[202:10.93]And we'll see you again.
[202:12.89]Talk about medieval.
[202:14.89]Remember that game?
[202:15.51]Talk about fucking Mario.
[202:19.31]Do not speak at all.

[202:49.18]Putting together this show has been so special to our team, personally and professionally.
[202:53.44]Thanks to all of you for showing up and believing in me and the Game Awards.
[202:57.45]We'll see you back here at the Peacock Theater for the Game Awards 2025.
[203:00.21]I'm not going to remember to come back.
[203:01.95]They gave me a date a year in advance?
[203:03.33]It's always around the same time.
[203:11.05]I'll put it on the calendar.
[203:13.51]There it is.
[203:15.63]So let's talk about the surprises.
[203:20.01]Let's talk about the surprises that you just can't believe happen.
[203:24.76]Well, I know you guys are reeling from that, and we're here to help you digest it.
[203:28.58]Yeah, let's digest it a little bit.
[203:30.86]What the fuck?
[203:34.88]They're like raining down on everybody else.
[203:36.72]Okay, I see.
[203:37.38]It's confetti.
[203:38.99]It's $100 bills, and it's the Joker, and everyone starts scrambling.
[203:43.81]See, they're all... Everybody here is a little greedy.
[203:47.52]See what happens.
[203:48.54]A little bit of green ends up showing up.
[203:51.00]They just start fighting.
[203:54.94]Oh, my God.
[203:56.64]Alright, so what did you think?
[204:00.32]I don't know.
[204:00.78]The time actually flew.
[204:01.74]That was just fun hanging out and talking about it.
[204:03.48]I always have a good time with the Game Awards, no matter what they show in it.
[204:07.04]It's really secondary, whatever is on the awards.
[204:10.73]I think it's cool to remember some cool stuff.
[204:12.97]Honestly, this year I didn't play a lot.
[204:16.97]So I don't have an opinion a lot.
[204:18.37]I just know I like Satisfactory.
[204:20.69]So I didn't experience a lot of...
[204:23.65]Withering Rooms.
[204:24.99]And I mean this, I'm telling you.
[204:26.19]If you don't know, what is he talking about?
[204:27.85]This guy just said Withering Rooms.
[204:29.13]I don't care.
[204:30.13]It's on Steam right now.
[204:31.86]Go to Steam.
[204:32.62]Withering Rooms.
[204:33.18]It's on PlayStation.
[204:35.20]Go get it.
[204:36.46]It's good.
[204:36.96]You're going to love it.
[204:38.48]It's a weird kind of, it's my game of the year.
[204:42.17]That's all that needs to be said.
[204:43.17]It is a side scrolling, Dark Souls, Resident Evil clock tower game I showed it a little bit.
[204:51.17]But that- Withering Rooms, game of the year, game was awesome. I loved every second of it.
[204:59.17]And then Balatro. Balatro was probably two and then UFo 50.
[205:03.17]And then whatever- uh whatever he liked.
[205:09.82]I don't know I feel like there was something at the beginning of the year that I was already like: Oh, this- this is it. And you just can't remember.
[205:15.82]Yeah you release- if you release the game in like I don't know January, you're not winning game of the year.
[205:23.82]Are you saying the recency bias is a problem?
[205:24.82]It is. I feel like sometimes I want to take notes.
[205:31.82]There's like no way- I can't even remember what it was though
[205:35.82]I used to do that I used to write down things that I actually really liked with like a letter grade.
[205:40.04]I think that was around the time, because you've been talking about Wuthering Rooms for a long time.
[205:42.92]I just feel like this year went by that fast.
[205:47.48]Yeah, this year was kind of fucking crazy.
[205:49.74]Went by quick.
[205:52.74]Yeah.
[205:54.22]And now it's over.
[205:55.66]Are you still streaming?
[205:56.50]Are you going to play PoE, I'm assuming?
[205:59.21]I am not.
[206:00.21]No, you're out of here?
[206:01.01]I goofed up my sleep schedule.
