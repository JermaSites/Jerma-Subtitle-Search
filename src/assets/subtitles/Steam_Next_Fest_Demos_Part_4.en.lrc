[ve:61.1.100]

[00:35.23]Good afternoon.
[00:38.32]Good evening.
[00:41.18]How are you?
[00:44.54]What's up?
[00:45.89]How you been?
[00:46.23]Good?
[00:47.45]Great.
[00:54.32]I'm doing good.
[00:55.76]I'm doing good.
[00:57.38]We are back.
[01:01.05]We got a lot going on in the next week.
[01:04.67]Whoa.
[01:04.97]Whoa.
[01:07.36]We're going to go over important priorities.
[01:10.97]There's a couple things I want to tell you about.
[01:12.63]One of them is food related.
[01:16.83]We'll see.
[01:23.80]I don't know why I have to make an announcement that I like cream of wheat.
[01:28.51]But that's what we do now.
[01:32.39]That's the first announcement.
[01:36.40]Cream of wheat is one of the greatest fucking things ever made.
[01:40.85]You can do anything to it.
[01:41.81]You can, you can add peanut butter.
[01:43.37]You can add pecans.
[01:45.04]You can put honey in it.
[01:47.60]It's a breakfast item.
[01:48.90]I've been doing for, it's been a breakfast thing for me.
[01:52.19]It is way better than oatmeal.
[01:55.67]Oatmeal.
[01:56.11]I, okay.
[01:56.61]I can take like two or three bites of oatmeal and then it's just like, I feel like a cartoon character swallowing it after a while.
[02:04.25]Cream of wheat is smooth.
[02:06.65]It's delicious.
[02:09.76]Don't get the sugary shit, though.
[02:12.12]You can dress up cream of wheat.
[02:16.90]You don't need to get yourself the, you know, 30 grams of sugar bullshit.
[02:20.73]You get the unsweetened or the lower sweet one.
[02:25.74]You can put strawberries in it.
[02:27.04]Oh, yep.
[02:34.47]Maple syrup and cream of wheat.
[02:35.75]Oh my goodness.
[02:36.51]You have just made a discovery.
[02:42.76]I've been eating this stuff like at least a few times a week.
[02:46.61]I love it.
[02:49.01]What about grits?
[02:51.25]Yeah, you know what?
[02:52.46]I actually... Grits are hard to make though, don't you?
[02:55.78]Isn't grits very specific?
[02:59.32]I remember my cousin Vinny and hearing about how difficult grits were to make well.
[03:06.03]They made it seem like it was a science.
[03:07.69]It was a big deal.
[03:09.23]So I was always scared of it.
[03:15.16]You mean to tell me that you can make a good grits in 15 fucking minutes?
[03:21.68]Well, I don't know.
[03:24.21]Now, let me tell you something.
[03:26.15]Oh, I am just so flattered by that.
[03:29.07]Remember The Judge?
[03:30.01]That's a great movie.
[03:38.75]Show how it's done.
[03:39.59]Make me a bowl.
[03:41.03]It is instant.
[03:42.79]Instant cream of wheat.
[03:45.86]Maybe I'll show you my recipe.
[03:47.98]It's open packet.
[03:49.67]Dump packet into bowl.
[03:52.09]Add strawberries.
[03:54.81]Done.
[03:57.66]What about indoor barbecue?
[04:02.01]I don't know.
[04:02.81]I don't really do that.
[04:07.64]Well, you have to cook it for, yeah, you have to, okay.
[04:09.46]If you do instant cream of wheat, you heat it up in, on the stove top or in the microwave.
[04:16.01]Add a little bit of milk in there.
[04:17.46]That's the secret.
[04:19.94]You know what I do?
[04:20.54]I do a little bit of butter after it's done, after it's all cooked to get it out.
[04:23.13]It's nice piping hot cream of wheat.
[04:25.57]You do a little pat of butter on the top.
[04:28.48]Do one scoop of, a little scoop of peanut butter.
[04:31.76]Or a drizzle of peanut butter.
[04:34.05]Get that on the side, let that melt in.
[04:36.33]And then sprinkle in like a little handful of pecans.
[04:39.57]Oh my god!
[04:46.94]Okay.
[04:47.58]Can you tell that I haven't streamed in like a week or two?
[04:50.47]Because this is what we're opening with.
[04:52.49]I had to tell you.
[04:54.27]I had to tell you this.
[04:56.26]Immediately.
[04:56.52]Immediately.
[04:59.63]Every time I eat a bite of this cream of weed, I go, I gotta tell chat this.
[05:05.02]My community needs to know.
[05:13.97]I don't actually do that.
[05:15.05]It's a joke, alright?
[05:17.19]I don't do that.
[05:18.03]I think I thought of it once of being like, maybe I should bring this up on stream.
[05:22.20]That's kind of funny.
[05:27.10]That was an extreme change of music.
[05:29.49]Hold on.
[05:31.05]Oh, you can't even hear it.
[05:31.71]We're fine.
[05:34.00]Okay, so let's go over some stuff.
[05:36.68]First of all, I would love to announce to you that, holy shit, I kind of went a little overboard, but I didn't because I want to collect this stuff.
[05:46.14]We've got an Omega SEGA CD opportunity.
[05:52.21]I've been collecting the SEGA CD for a while.
[05:54.58]And the 3DO, like you guys know.
[05:57.46]There is now... About... My SEGA CD collection is about like 60 games.
[06:06.81]I have like 60 or 70 fucking SEGA CD games.
[06:10.41]I went crazy.
[06:13.05]Now, I did have some before.
[06:14.62]Okay, I had some before.
[06:16.76]I had a ton of 3DO stuff before.
[06:18.34]This is over the last 10 years, right?
[06:20.22]But recently, I kind of got back into it.
[06:25.13]They all look fun.
[06:37.07]Do you collect them?
[06:38.49]I do.
[06:40.05]My goal is to eventually...
[06:43.63]Like, I kind of want a complete SEGA CD collection.
[06:48.82]But the problem with that is some of these SEGA CD games, like one of them in particular, or a few of them, you look at it and you go, oh yeah, because I would say, I'd say like 80% of SEGA CD games are between like $20 and $30.
[07:02.86]Right?
[07:04.16]Because like everybody hates this fucking console.
[07:08.52]So it's not really thought of as a, wow, I loved the SEGA CD.
[07:13.65]People didn't really love it that much.
[07:15.33]I loved it.
[07:16.01]I thought it was great.
[07:18.49]So most of the games are like between $20 and $40 at this current kind of market, I guess you could call it.
[07:24.92]But some of them, some of them are not.
[07:28.25]And I don't know if I'm going to get those ones.
[07:30.97]There's an old Kojima game for the SEGA CD called Snatcher.
[07:35.75]This game is like $1,500.
[07:38.78]And I was like, that's a lot.
[07:41.30]Damn.
[07:45.23]It was also on the Saturn too.
[07:48.15]Dude, we're okay.
[07:49.07]Stuff like this is so weird when you get into this world of sort of collecting and aftermarket stuff.
[07:53.98]I know we got stuff to play, but just just to give you a little bit of a kind of how weird things are.
[07:59.44]For some reason, the Terminator SEGA CD game is like two or three hundred dollars.
[08:06.96]And then, like, it's surrounded by a bunch of, like, $20 to $30 games.
[08:11.89]And I'm just like, why?
[08:12.75]Why is the Terminator, like, $200?
[08:14.67]No, I don't have the Terminator.
[08:22.79]And then Earthworm Jim SEGA CD.
[08:25.47]I like want that one.
[08:27.18]I was like, it's the CD quality audio.
[08:28.98]It's got all kinds of different things.
[08:30.92]It's cool.
[08:31.48]The artwork is great.
[08:32.99]This shit's like four or 500 bucks for the fucking SEGA CD version.
[08:35.89]I was like, holy shit.
[08:36.71]The Super Nintendo one is like, you probably get it for like 20 bucks.
[08:44.71]Retro collector moment.
[08:46.23]Yeah.
[08:47.95]But thankfully, I mean, if you do want to collect SEGA CD, and even like the old 3DO stuff, that kind of does it for you.
[08:55.42]Most of them are in like the $20 to $30 range, like $30 at least is the average.
[09:01.33]But there are a few that are just crazy.
[09:03.07]It's kind of interesting to go into the store.
[09:05.45]If you go to like a game store, or like retro convention, or you see the price tags, it's like $20, $20, $30, $15, $15, $15, $1500!
[09:18.54]You only gotta buy one, though, yeah.
[09:24.25]Didn't you spend about that much for Chibi-Robo?
[09:26.76]I didn't spend $1,500 on Chibi-Robo.
[09:29.48]You know what the big one was?
[09:31.25]This is years ago, and I still have it.
[09:33.31]Uh, Gacha Force.
[09:35.37]You guys remember Gacha Force?
[09:36.40]That's one of my favorite GameCube games.
[09:37.76]That game is expensive.
[09:40.78]And it was expensive five, ten years ago when I bought it.
[09:48.26]Everybody talked shit about that game, too, when I played it.
[09:50.52]Remember when I played through the whole thing?
[09:51.75]And everyone was like, dude, this is his favorite expensive game for the GameCube.
[09:55.01]This is his favorite GameCube game?
[09:56.29]This game fucking stinks.
[10:00.60]And everyone's like, get a real GameCube game.
[10:04.51]Like that Cube game that's $500.
[10:06.17]And I was like, I don't want that one.
[10:11.50]TV Robo is a great game.
[10:12.86]It's on the Switch now, right?
[10:14.32]Don't they have the Switch Pass or whatever the hell it is?
[10:19.38]with the GameCube stuff.
[10:20.86]I know that I think it's on there.
[10:25.21]But anyways.
[10:27.43]Anyways.
[10:30.31]The TL;DR is that there is some kind of obscure...
[10:36.22]I've done SEGA CD before a few times, but there's stuff that I have now that is stuff that I've never even heard of.
[10:43.57]A ton of FMV stuff.
[10:44.85]We got Dracula Unleashed, which don't look it up.
[10:48.30]We're doing this shit for fucking Halloween.
[10:50.26]Dracula Unleashed, we're going to play it Halloween night.
[10:52.79]Don't look it up.
[10:59.39]There's like, okay, you know what's funny about the SEGA CD?
[11:01.44]There's like four or five Dracula games.
[11:08.54]But yeah, there's a lot.
[11:10.21]It's not going to be one stream.
[11:12.45]Not going to be two streams.
[11:16.23]This is one of those things where because I'm turning into a SEGA CD weirdo.
[11:21.50]And I want to give them time, too.
[11:23.46]I want to show them on stream, too.
[11:25.04]I think that's kind of fun.
[11:26.24]It's like, here's the case.
[11:27.06]Here's what the artwork looks like.
[11:30.71]The SEGA CD is sitting right next to me right now.
[11:32.33]That's an interesting sentence.
[11:33.21]The SEGA CD is sitting here next to me.
[11:38.29]But I want to I don't want to rush through them because in the past we've done lots of these kind of grab bag old goofy weird game streams and I spend like 10 minutes in one game.
[11:50.96]The ones that I really want to give time to I'm going to spend time in them.
[11:54.95]This is going to take months to go through these.
[11:56.95]We're not going to do it all in a row.
[12:00.02]yeah I'm very excited about it I got a new uh upscaler too so we're still gonna get like the crustiness of the original hardware but it should look a little better so I'm very excited to play around with it and test it out that was a yap fest that's only been 10 minutes what am I talking about it's been 10 minutes
[12:30.38]What about public domain, uh, oh, it's scary movies from a Public Domain Movie Night?
[12:35.99]Alright.
[12:36.51]Maybe, but I got, I got plans.
[12:38.35]I got plans.
[12:38.75]Don't worry.
[12:39.75]We're going to do some fun stuff.
[12:41.99]Okay.
[12:43.11]Today, uh, I'm not going to stream for that long today.
[12:46.06]I wanted to play a little bit today.
[12:48.68]I think Thursday we're going to do Lego party with, uh, the boys.
[12:53.70]But I did want to get a stream in.
[12:56.22]I'm itching to at least hang out for a little bit.
[12:58.80]So we're going to play.
[12:59.57]I saw that the Steam Next Fest came out.
[13:02.85]We're going to go through.
[13:04.51]We're going to hang out.
[13:05.69]And I got like, I already went through and I got like 10 to 15 of these.
[13:10.42]We're going to jump through them.
[13:11.40]I'm very excited about the first one because this to me, this first one is kind of the game I told you guys I wanted.
[13:16.52]And I hope just judging by the thumbnail that it's a game that I want.
[13:23.48]Okay?
[13:25.17]The first game we're gonna play is, I think it's called, like, Bigfoot's Life?
[13:30.41]Remember I told you I want a game where you just, like, a big- you're a big ape?
[13:33.94]And you have to, like, fight animals and stuff?
[13:35.58]I- this could be that game.
[13:37.44]This might be the- you have to, like, fight fucking lions in, like, the forest.
[13:42.11]It's very possible.
[13:44.70]I'm so excited.
[13:45.68]I hope that's what this is.
[13:47.16]I hope there's a dodge roll.
[13:48.58]If Bigfoot has a dodge roll, it gets a full letter grade right off the bat.
[13:51.31]You understand?
[13:53.05]Alright, let's go.
[14:00.73]Can you hear it?
[14:03.07]I can't.
[14:07.17]make sure you can get a good audio there alright this might be loud but whatever alright here we go this is called bigfoot's life I don't think that's what it's called photosensitive the game contains bright flashing lights wait what in the bigfoot game bigfoot life alright why why would it mean flashing lights
[14:31.66]So what is Bigfoot's life?
[14:33.66]I wonder.
[14:34.70]It's the lighting?
[14:36.54]Dude, this looks pretty buttery.
[14:37.64]I'm not gonna lie.
[14:40.31]I'm just gonna go.
[14:41.37]Should we do the options?
[14:42.11]1920 by 1080!
[14:46.15]What the fuck?
[14:47.01]No, this is gonna...
[14:47.77]I'm putting it up to 4K.
[14:50.20]Is that gonna fuck up something?
[14:53.60]Uh-oh.
[14:57.24]Did that work?
[14:58.04]Oh, hold on.
[14:59.98]Alright, here we go, new game, Bigfoot Life.
[15:15.44]Wait, you have to- wait, Bigfoot already exists, right?
[15:17.87]Wouldn't- wouldn't- why does it- we have to make our own Bigfoot?
[15:25.36]That's not a- that's just a guy's dick right there, right?
[15:28.24]I hope not.
[15:29.62]What was that?
[15:31.60]Uh...
[15:37.13]Custom Bigfoot.
[15:38.43]We can- oh, we can make him- we can make him bald?
[15:40.28]Hold on, I want to do- wait.
[15:50.31]Why is this game so stupid?
[15:52.74]Fur quality, high.
[15:54.95]Foot size.
[15:55.69]Are we gonna have huge feet?
[15:58.08]Well, he is Bigfoot, right?
[15:59.34]I feel like it has to be that way.
[16:02.32]Body weight.
[16:03.49]Oh, boy.
[16:07.65]Body camera facecam.
[16:09.80]Oh, my goodness.
[16:18.85]Go pull it back.
[16:19.61]Pull it back.
[16:20.77]Why can I make him blue?
[16:26.90]Alright, I'm happy with this.
[16:27.88]This is fine.
[16:34.41]Alright, um... Let's have him have...
[16:39.66]Wait, can I make him... Let me make him really small with a big head?
[16:41.98]No, he's gotta be like this.
[16:45.27]I... Mode normal, difficult...
[16:47.23]I can't even change that.
[16:53.88]No, the foot size needs to be bigger.
[16:55.58]Come on.
[17:04.39]I see he has a stick.
[17:05.98]I hope that's what we start with.
[17:12.55]Day one, year one.
[17:14.21]Like ever?
[17:17.31]Welcome to Bigfoot Life.
[17:18.16]This is your home base.
[17:19.20]Humans can't enter here.
[17:23.10]This is your home.
[17:24.10]You can sleep in shelters to go to the next day.
[17:26.59]This will also restore energy.
[17:28.61]This is your home base.
[17:30.33]Dude, it's like playing Tarn in World of Warcraft.
[17:32.90]How do I move?
[17:35.36]Great, now let's check out your camera.
[17:37.38]Okay.
[17:39.27]Choose your camera view and FOV.
[17:41.23]These can be changed at any time.
[17:47.18]Uh, over the shoulder?
[17:48.78]I guess this is fine.
[17:49.82]I'm gonna keep it like this.
[17:53.22]Finished, yes.
[17:58.18]Alright, this is not running that well.
[18:00.54]This is... What is this view distance?
[18:03.30]I don't think this view distance should be this high.
[18:06.00]I don't think the view distance should be this high.
[18:08.40]I'm seeing the entire...
[18:09.35]I'm seeing the whole fucking game.
[18:14.35]Hold on a second.
[18:15.47]Should I turn the volume... Should I turn the graphics down?
[18:17.85]Should I turn the graphics down?
[18:21.58]Should I go back to 1080p?
[18:25.70]I shouldn't have been able to see those trees, I don't think.
[18:33.48]Dude, I don't know what's going on, but...
[18:35.16]Okay, there we go!
[18:35.98]Hey, look at that!
[18:37.54]It just...
[18:37.96]I had to compile the shaders.
[18:40.08]Go to this icon on your map and place the three nearby logs on it.
[18:47.71]Dude, you got... You got 50... Yeah, this is 50...
[18:49.90]This is a fucking monster computer, okay?
[18:54.30]Maybe I should turn the graphics down.
[18:59.21]Uh, how about, um... Is it the fur quality that's doing it?
[19:09.81]I'll put the fur quality and the texture quality and the shadow quality down.
[19:23.35]This is, this is not running well.
[19:25.95]Alright, I'm just gonna deal with it, whatever.
[19:27.47]This is Bigfoot Lives, or whatever it's called.
[19:31.76]Bigfoot's life.
[19:35.50]Okay, I need three sticks.
[19:41.74]Oh my god, can I smash other fucking apes with this?
[19:54.04]Dude, what is the other meter?
[19:55.12]I have energy, food, water, and then... What the fuck was that?
[20:03.21]Where's like...
[20:04.17]I have Bigfoot vision!
[20:05.71]Oh, I don't have that Bigfoot skill yet.
[20:09.54]How do you smash?
[20:26.15]Alright.
[20:28.30]I need two more sticks.
[20:41.61]What was the other...
[20:42.19]Okay, there's one here.
[20:44.06]Game looks super smooth.
[20:45.64]I don't...
[20:45.98]There's probably a setting I haven't enabled.
[20:47.62]I don't know what the setting is.
[20:48.74]Maybe I should go exclusive fullscreen?
[20:50.24]VSync.
[20:51.99]Bro, I don't know.
[20:55.48]This is my first shelter.
[20:58.88]Great.
[20:59.10]Now let's take a look at some of your tasks and goals.
[21:04.73]Okay.
[21:05.59]Objectives.
[21:07.83]Bigfoot demo tasks.
[21:10.60]Collect all this stuff.
[21:16.24]You can visit each of the waypoints on your map to learn something new.
[21:23.41]Look for bugs.
[21:24.57]Hold on a second.
[21:27.61]Alright, that's what we got going on.
[21:29.61]Frame limit 120.
[21:30.65]HDR off.
[21:32.70]Did that fix it?
[21:43.93]I don't know.
[21:45.01]We might have to get out of Bigfoot's life in a few seconds here.
[21:48.83]I want to crush one bug or something first.
[21:59.64]Breaking branches.
[22:00.54]Try to break this tree branch.
[22:03.43]You can break tree branches with rocks.
[22:09.18]All the way down with rocks.
[22:11.60]I need to give me a rock.
[22:18.19]There we go.
[22:19.32]Alright, let's smash something.
[22:21.42]Pick up and throw this rock.
[22:27.47]We're staying in this.
[22:28.81]I don't care how bad it runs.
[22:30.17]This is the game I've always wanted.
[22:38.93]Bigfoot speed?
[22:42.78]Oh, shit.
[23:03.70]Mushrooms!
[23:05.54]Wait, are they poisonous?
[23:10.95]Can Bigfoot get poisoned?
[23:25.51]There's more things.
[23:26.11]I want to find a human.
[23:27.95]I want to find a human and just do like a double crow hop haymaker to his face.
[23:31.94]Do you know what I'm saying?
[23:40.64]There's gotta be something I can do.
[23:49.77]Oh my god.
[23:49.99]I want this game to run.
[23:50.89]Maybe I just shouldn't run.
[23:52.45]I think running is what causes it.
[23:55.27]Berries, eat these.
[24:06.02]Lower the resolution scale?
[24:12.88]Should I do it like 60?
[24:14.37]Let's do 60.
[24:19.94]Oh, that worked!
[24:22.22]Alright, we can play.
[24:23.08]Let's go.
[24:31.60]I want to make a shelter.
[24:32.80]Wait, I can swing.
[24:34.02]Hold on a minute.
[24:34.52]This is where the game gets fucking crazy.
[24:42.94]Wait, that's a human!
[24:47.31]Human collectibles.
[24:48.15]Pick up the first aid kit and bring it back to home base.
[24:53.24]I'm gonna fight that pig over there.
[25:00.89]Alright, Bigfoot versus Warthog.
[25:03.32]Who wins?
[25:14.14]Ah dude, get the picture of Bigfoot.
[25:39.87]I just got Bigfoot points for that.
[25:47.57]What the fuck?
[25:48.71]Okay.
[25:50.84]I want to fight something.
[25:57.97]What's this?
[25:59.75]See, yeah, there's like a diamond meter with his gems, this mystical power.
[26:04.96]Pick up a stick nearby and hit the mystical stone with it.
[26:10.37]So this is what he does all day.
[26:17.51]Oh wait, there's something here.
[26:19.41]There's more sticks?
[26:27.91]Dude, I can't believe this game was like maxing out my VRAM.
[26:33.84]I've played Robocop at like ultra settings.
[26:37.56]And Bigfoot's life is what like maxed out my fucking 5080.
[26:51.27]Alright, I want to see what else there is to offer.
[26:53.08]I want to throw a rock at something.
[26:55.66]So important.
[27:00.13]There's gotta be humans here trying to take pictures of me.
[27:01.83]I can just throw rocks at them, right?
[27:19.38]Oh, is it wet?
[27:19.78]Can I drink out of the stream?
[27:26.42]Catching fish and drinking water.
[27:28.65]What, I just go into the water and just start drinking?
[27:42.48]There is a bathroom meter.
[27:47.91]That was so easy.
[27:48.95]Am I just fast?
[27:59.09]He eats him whole.
[28:02.20]OK, let me see the map.
[28:06.32]There's a couple more things to look at over here.
[28:11.55]Is it a turkey?
[28:14.15]I do.
[28:14.49]I thought that was a turkey is an upside down skunk.
[28:16.82]I honestly thought it was a turkey.
[28:18.98]That was a turkey.
[28:31.38]Eat more random shit on the ground.
[28:32.76]Bigfoot's immune to all poisons!
[28:41.73]I have no idea what my home base is, by the way.
[28:47.20]Isn't Bigfoot supposed to protect nature?
[28:48.90]I don't know.
[29:00.10]Bring to your home base to collect.
[29:01.94]Okay, well, can I store it?
[29:06.17]Although I pick up the first aid kit, like, I know what this is.
[29:11.56]Whoa.
[29:14.04]Fuck you.
[29:17.35]You want to go?
[29:17.85]Will no one challenge me?
[29:23.01]Why?
[29:23.40]No one will challenge me.
[29:29.07]I guess this is a skill tree.
[29:34.84]Okay, it wants me to eat more berries.
[29:36.08]It wants me to crush insects, eat mushrooms, uh, scare animals, healed animals, break branches.
[29:44.51]I love how scare animals is over heal animals.
[29:48.06]Knowledge.
[29:52.10]Insects are under rocks, tree frog, you can, okay.
[29:57.41]I want to get in a fight.
[30:00.66]Wait, look at the bugs under the rocks, right?
[30:14.28]Wait, berries were part of the objective.
[30:15.90]Hold on.
[30:20.30]Guardian of the forest.
[30:21.76]Is he a guardian?
[30:22.45]I had no idea.
[30:26.99]I told you, he's been reduced to comic relief in every adult animated show.
[30:38.48]In every single cartoon that is for an older audience.
[30:42.61]There's an episode where he shows up.
[30:45.17]Or they give him a...
[31:19.67]Why am I the Dark Souls enemy?
[31:26.90]What?
[31:32.46]Whoa, who turned the lights off?
[31:36.45]I just picked this guy up, I'm holding him!
[31:38.61]What do I do with him?
[31:45.47]What do I do with him?
[31:46.51]What do I do with this guy?
[31:52.98]I don't know what to put other people over at the- It's so dark I can't see anything.
[31:56.71]Do I have a flashlight?
[32:03.03]It's up to you.
[32:35.47]Who's playing the guitar, man?
[32:43.16]Oh, where's my house?
[32:46.62]Oh, there's more people!
[33:01.94]Get over here!
[33:06.93]Whatever, I'm going.
[33:07.95]I'm out of here.
[33:08.51]Wait, is this my base?
[33:21.89]Oh shit, this is my home base.
[33:32.11]I'm trying to throw him in the water.
[33:37.44]Oh, fuck.
[33:39.16]Alright, you can see Big Jay.
[33:45.79]Get in the water!
[33:46.61]Oh my fucking god.
[33:52.73]Why are you chasing me?
[33:58.52]Okay, how do I throw?
[33:59.68]Oh, okay.
[34:04.13]My left click is pick up.
[34:05.47]I think I broke it.
[34:08.12]I broke it.
[34:09.06]I can't press E. I can't press left click.
[34:11.02]I can't roar.
[34:11.76]I'm stuck like this forever.
[34:15.83]I think I screwed it up.
[34:16.75]I picked up too many people.
[34:24.74]Okay, that was Bigfoot's life.
[34:29.04]It was crazy.
[34:31.71]I had a great time.
[34:32.77]It was a fun demo.
[34:34.69]It was wild.
[34:36.07]Okay, I can't take the screaming.
[34:38.63]Alright, moving on to the next one.
[34:43.77]What do we got next?
[34:48.50]Coming up next is...
[34:50.00]I can't believe this is a real game.
[34:54.21]Okay, do you want Bubsy 4D?
[34:58.02]Or what?
[35:03.24]We got Bubsy 4D.
[35:12.02]Can I just get that out of the way?
[35:13.04]I feel like people are gonna... Yeah.
[35:22.20]Bubsy 4D is actually good.
[35:23.50]Alright, we'll find out.
[35:25.16]We'll see if it is.
[35:27.28]It might be loud.
[35:27.86]Be careful.
[35:29.19]I'm saying that...
[35:30.43]Okay.
[35:31.37]Alright, this is an Atari game.
[35:38.36]Is Atari coming back?
[35:48.76]A little bit.
[35:51.46]Oh, okay.
[35:52.08]Did they make him like a zoomer?
[35:53.85]They're gonna make him a streamer.
[35:57.49]Watch.
[36:02.78]This is literally you now.
[36:15.67]No, it is not.
[36:22.53]I keep thinking of the people screaming in the Bigfoot game.
[36:38.99]What the heck?
[36:43.84]No!
[36:44.76]We want you in your original outfit from the Super Nintendo game!
[36:54.72]We're getting a bunch of minus twos for that.
[37:11.37]You can unlock the original model.
[37:12.75]That's funny.
[37:15.15]By the way, this camera has the same amount of battery life as a Game Gear.
[37:18.38]We've been here for about five minutes.
[37:21.10]We're at 80% battery.
[37:24.29]I don't remember any of these characters, by the way.
[37:31.46]Who are these people?
[37:34.74]There was a Bubsy cartoon?
[37:46.89]There was a cartoon pilot.
[37:50.60]Is it new?
[37:57.73]I really should start locking my door at this rate.
[38:01.66]Who's back?
[38:02.64]The Woolies again?
[38:04.76]It was terrible.
[38:05.77]It was really, really bad.
[38:06.85]It's on the Bubsy collection in its entirety.
[38:09.69]Really?
[38:10.09]That's funny.
[38:18.00]What are my thoughts?
[38:22.45]Who cares?
[38:23.05]I love demos.
[38:23.95]We get to go from Bigfoot's life to this.
[38:27.13]I miss Bigfoot's life, I'm not gonna lie.
[38:29.16]I feel like with a little bit more time in the oven, that game could be really fun.
[38:33.30]I'm looking forward to it.
[38:34.98]Well, maybe we should care a little bit.
[38:40.85]A golden fleece!
[38:42.68]Let's go after them!
[38:47.35]I hate this outfit.
[38:51.39]That's a terrible outfit.
[38:52.31]I think it's awful.
[38:54.16]Okay.
[39:11.74]Bubsy or Garfield?
[39:12.92]Garfield every time.
[39:19.93]Garfield just is lazy and is kind of eats like pasta and stuff and lasagna.
[39:28.63]He's really not that much of a pro.
[39:30.33]Everyone that kind of hates Garfield, like ironically, what he just eats and just makes fun of his like fucking loser owner or whatever it is.
[39:42.45]How do I play?
[39:44.65]Spend your yarn balls on outfits.
[39:46.55]Okay.
[39:46.75]Okay.
[39:49.73]Is the game loading?
[39:59.23]John Arbuckle is not a loser.
[40:17.25]I feel like this is Sonic the Hedgehog.
[40:20.26]I don't know, I'm getting...
[40:22.58]I'm getting sonic vibes from this.
[40:25.95]The music, all the characters, everybody... VR Sims or talk?
[40:35.28]Okay, um... What is a VR sim?
[40:43.99]I know!
[40:47.50]Let's just do it.
[40:48.10]I'm ready for the mission.
[40:49.58]I know how to play Bumsy.
[40:50.34]It's jump and collect the yarn balls.
[40:58.14]Throw away into the trash.
[41:03.59]What was that?
[41:07.34]Alright, is that what I'm doing?
[41:08.60]I have to do the tutorial?
[41:17.69]Oh, man.
[41:33.69]Angle of sensitivity impact the speed.
[41:35.31]Oh, do you got something to say?
[41:37.55]Can you hear me?
[41:38.88]Fantastic.
[41:39.34]I can interface with you through the terminal.
[41:44.89]Okay.
[41:45.01]I think I'm just going to go.
[41:47.76]Hit the input to quickly reorient the camera.
[41:50.72]Oh, okay.
[41:54.89]Holding the input increases how high you jump.
[41:56.93]Yep.
[41:57.77]Yep.
[41:58.65]Yep.
[42:05.96]Okay.
[42:07.28]Double jump in the game.
[42:08.44]Was there a double jump in the original?
[42:14.91]Left trigger is glide.
[42:22.13]I hate that, by the way.
[42:23.69]I hate that sound he just made.
[42:28.00]Okay.
[42:36.73]I mean, it's fun.
[42:37.83]I like the platforming.
[42:43.60]Careful.
[42:44.32]Metallic surfaces like these are quite slippery.
[42:47.58]I'll slide across it gracefully.
[42:50.59]Okay.
[42:55.24]Why is it not playing the...
[43:10.91]Does he shit in the litter box?
[43:17.58]Okay.
[43:17.70]Do these count as the yarn balls?
[43:18.72]I think so.
[43:21.89]I hate that.
[43:29.48]I don't like that sound.
[43:30.56]I don't like it at all.
[43:33.24]Is there a sprint button?
[43:35.29]What the hell?
[43:41.59]It's too much.
[43:52.85]Okay, pounce then leap.
[43:56.12]Oh, okay.
[44:03.33]So that's how you run.
[44:04.55]Hitting the pinhead while pouncing will ricochet you.
[44:11.94]That's kind of fun.
[44:12.60]That's some innovation from Bubsy.
[44:21.12]This is when everybody at the convention all gets up.
[44:24.05]And we go to the Who Can Do Bubsy the Best voice acting competition.
[44:28.46]And there's hundreds of people backstage.
[44:31.19]And they're all lined up.
[44:32.01]They all get a chance with a microphone.
[44:33.35]Everyone has to cheer for who can do the best one.
[44:38.99]And I get up there.
[44:40.51]I brush off the fucking mic with this sanitization wipe.
[44:44.01]The alcohol on it, man.
[44:45.84]Disgusts me.
[44:47.42]I'm number, like, 200.
[44:49.56]Put a mic close to my face.
[44:51.54]I lean in.
[44:52.18]I do some underneath, away from the microphone first.
[44:56.05]Put it up to my face.
[44:57.61]And I know I'm gonna fucking nail it.
[44:58.87]And everyone's gonna scream when they hear it.
[45:01.13]Because, like, that guy right before me?
[45:03.01]Dog shit.
[45:04.23]Before that guy?
[45:05.21]Dog shit.
[45:06.19]I'm gonna wow him.
[45:10.41]Hi, my name's Jeremy Elbertson, you call me Jerma.
[45:13.35]And this is- here we go!
[45:16.10]If I could possibly go wrong.
[45:19.68]Yeah!
[45:20.50]Everybody fucking screams, and then I get a job.
[45:24.89]Oh fuck, I fell off.
[45:36.18]Try combining your pounce with flutter step.
[45:41.07]Oh.
[45:45.60]Holy shit, that's... Look at the traversal!
[45:52.54]No, no, no!
[46:05.86]That's cute.
[46:06.68]That's cute.
[46:07.58]That's cute.
[46:08.16]I like that.
[46:13.49]alright it's growing on me at that it's growing on me I like it now whoever thought checkpoints should be litter boxes probably thinks they're real funny alright directly pounds a wall to start clamoring up it alright
[46:40.99]Dude, okay, alright, I get it.
[46:48.22]This game's way cooler than I thought it was going to be.
[46:55.65]I retract every statement I've made.
[47:05.10]Alright, hold on, hold on.
[47:06.16]Everyone just called me clean with it, and now I fucked it up.
[47:10.75]There's a glide, a pounce, and a double jump.
[47:28.14]Clean with it, right?
[47:29.60]That's what I want to see in the chat, please.
[47:33.95]Wait, press to swap in and I can roll?
[47:36.13]Ooh.
[47:43.52]This game actually might be kind of good.
[47:54.81]Am I crazy?
[48:10.91]What just happened there?
[48:17.06]Since when can I do that?
[48:18.91]What, turn into a giant fuzzy hairball?
[48:21.25]Yeah, excellent question, my curious cat.
[48:24.67]I wonder if it's due to the radiation I exposed you to recently.
[48:29.34]The heck?
[48:32.08]Alright, here we go.
[48:35.24]Okay, they took this idea of Bubsy and they made it...
[48:38.97]I don't know, how do you make an interesting 3D platformer in 2025?
[48:43.52]I guess I'm impressed.
[48:46.77]I'm not going to lie.
[48:49.17]Seems pretty fun.
[48:51.93]Hit the brakes to stop rolling.
[48:53.38]Okay.
[49:05.31]I feel like if you speedrun games, when this comes out, you might actually be...
[49:09.56]This might actually do it.
[49:13.11]I can bounce higher.
[49:14.65]I can bounce like this.
[49:15.39]Do I have to time it?
[49:23.80]Holding to continue bouncing can be combined with the boost.
[49:28.65]Like bunny hopping?
[49:38.10]Oh, I get it.
[49:40.43]Not clean, but fine.
[50:08.54]Oh, Bubsy!
[50:10.64]What could possibly happen to you?
[50:12.23]I think you better be a character like that in the game.
[50:28.92]Cool.
[50:29.14]I like it.
[50:30.06]Is there more?
[50:39.03]You're Bubsy coded?
[50:42.72]The fuck are you doing?
[50:53.27]The fuck are you doing?
[51:00.14]When we went to commercial break, I said a word that I shouldn't have said, and it won't happen again.
[51:21.17]The fuck are you doing?
[51:23.01]I love him.
[51:29.06]Dude, I got an ET version of Atari, by the way.
[51:49.28]And I was actually surprised that you can get them.
[51:53.21]I actually got the landfill game.
[51:55.45]I thought they put them all in landfills when I saw it.
[51:57.30]I was like, dude, that's the landfill game!
[51:58.88]And I freaked out.
[52:10.52]No, I didn't get it out of the landfill with my bare hands.
[52:16.92]Oh, dude, there it is!
[52:19.12]I'm currently digging through the landfill.
[52:23.32]Say hi to Squeaks.
[52:33.76]Hey, Squeaks!
[52:38.72]Why did you want me to do that?
[52:42.25]Oh, here we go.
[52:43.75]Oh, this is gonna be sick.
[52:56.65]That was a good scream.
[53:03.70]Are we gonna get the original music too?
[53:05.50]That would be huge.
[53:12.73]Okay?
[53:17.94]Strange planet.
[53:19.18]Everything seems to be made out of wool.
[53:27.07]That'd probably be really awesome to walk around on.
[53:30.26]Alright, let's go.
[53:36.03]Everything's very colorful.
[53:37.02]Looks really pretty.
[53:45.83]Ooh, platforming.
[53:46.72]Here we go.
[54:03.29]I could have made it.
[54:12.58]You can grab that.
[54:13.16]The grip is good.
[54:13.78]I thought it was only going to be like one second.
[54:22.00]Where am I?
[54:26.34]Earn your camera.
[54:31.20]So bad.
[54:32.22]Alright, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[54:43.86]Oh, that was fun.
[54:45.82]I love it!
[54:49.53]Why am I being so weird?
[54:53.78]I'm so glad he says it.
[55:06.89]Whoa, that jump is way different.
[55:13.99]Not quite forward if you're holding the analog.

[57:20.88]Oh, I think that was the goal of the level.
[57:24.34]Now I need to get all 150 and I'm not going to stop until I get every single one of them.
[57:29.67]I have you here.
[57:30.83]You're trapped here now.

[58:09.34]They don't, alright.

[58:46.79]Uh oh.
[58:48.11]I'm dead.
[58:53.66]We can't hear.
[58:55.48]What do you mean you can't hear?
[58:56.36]Every time Bubsy quips, you should try to one-up him.
[59:00.46]That's not possible.
[59:02.47]This character was designed to be a quip character.
[59:05.79]You got a room full of people writing these lines.
[59:08.03]I'm just me, right here, live.
[59:15.58]Ooh, look at that.
[59:16.48]Okay, let's go over there.
[59:17.22]Can I get over there?
[59:20.47]I gotta go around.
[59:34.29]I thought you were a performance artist.
[59:37.49]No, I'm...
[59:38.74]I'm not.
[59:41.36]Not anymore.
[59:45.21]Ah, I can jump over there.
[59:56.58]Okay.
[59:58.12]Ooh, good.
[59:59.21]Alright, here we go.
[60:01.17]Very, very fun.
[60:01.79]Let's move.
[60:17.02]Did I get them all?
[60:19.12]Something is chasing me.
[60:29.70]Yeah, I should play more games like this.
[60:32.74]I feel like the, okay, I've always told you guys that games that have two buttons and are very easy to just understand are very, I can play them.
[60:44.46]Can I?
[60:46.90]Oh, I cannot do that.
[60:55.03]If your game is run around and have four buttons, I got it.
[61:01.22]Visual style is interesting.
[61:02.26]I think the game is good.
[61:06.32]In a sea of the kind of 3D platformer games like this that I've seen and played and heard of over the years, this one feels pretty good.
[61:15.27]I like Bubsy.
[61:16.57]I think I like the Bubsy voice.
[61:22.32]I like the Bubsy aesthetic right now.
[61:24.28]I don't like that fucking costume though.
[61:26.20]I'd love to see that changed.
[61:31.03]There's one more thing that I didn't get.
[61:46.52]what the hell that head flip was I uh oh some free upgrades for my epic adventure cringe and you're currently not free
[62:10.00]I am getting Sonic the Hedgehog vibes.
[62:11.74]It is the music, the kind of overworld area where you kind of hang out and the electric guitar plays.
[62:25.00]Shop.
[62:27.34]Twirl jump.
[62:30.85]Skins.
[62:34.91]Ah.
[62:36.11]I can't buy it.
[62:40.10]Okay.
[62:46.13]Cool.
[62:47.81]That's better than the one that I had on.
[62:51.58]That one's even better.
[62:53.28]Hedgehog style.
[63:01.21]Uh.
[63:03.33]Hello?
[63:08.07]Uh.
[63:11.74]uh is it he he's standing this is this is not alright where he's standing right now right he's he's in this is not this is not cool he needs to put clothes on right now or he needs to go to a changing room oh I can't wait to get this dirty he's okay we're good look at you you little fashionista
[63:44.75]He really did.
[63:46.17]I feel both attacked and seen at the same time.
[63:54.14]Look at what he's saying here.
[63:58.61]Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[64:01.01]Maybe I am like Bubsy.
[64:03.69]Am I like Bubsy?
[64:05.49]Maybe I should use him as my profile picture.
[64:09.82]I don't know.
[64:12.66]Now, where to go next, I wonder?
[64:14.80]Uh, is that it for the demo?
[64:19.03]Or do I have to get more stuff?
[64:20.23]I'm good with moving on, but that was fun.
[64:21.45]I liked it a lot.
[64:27.62]I think when the game comes out, uh, it's gonna be fun and people are gonna like it.
[64:32.26]And if I'm wrong, then whatever.
[64:33.50]I've been wrong about half the stupid shit I've ever said in my whole life.
[64:37.13]Bob Z4.
[64:40.03]And the Great Muppet Caper.
[64:42.01]Whatever the fuck this name of this game is.
[64:46.56]Okay, next we're going to play.
[64:47.93]I love Bubsy.
[64:54.59]Bubsy's great.
[64:56.30]He got a bad rep. You hated him 30 minutes ago.
[65:10.70]No, I didn't.
[65:12.08]Guys, I asked...
[65:14.07]I asked if you guys wanted to see the Bubsy wacky collection, and everyone unanimously said no, don't fucking open that game.
[65:22.02]We all like this one!
[65:29.80]You're just tricking us into thinking that Bubsy was cool all along.
[65:36.57]Psychological.
[65:38.54]Okay, we got...
[65:40.32]I'm going to play this one because people want me to play this one.
[65:43.83]It's called Final Sentence.
[65:45.63]And I'm going to embarrass myself.
[65:46.87]I don't care.
[65:47.98]We're going to play Final Sentence Demo.
[65:51.34]This is another one that I picked up.
[65:55.13]I'm imagining this is a typing game, so we're going to move the controller out of the way.
[66:06.20]If it's a spelling game, I'm screwed.
[66:08.28]If it's a typing game, I'm screwed.
[66:09.60]If it's a combination of both, I'm double screwed.
[66:20.02]Okay.
[66:21.26]I think I'm just going to play.
[66:23.82]Play your first three minutes to learn the basics.
[66:27.95]Reach level 10.
[66:32.91]Okay.
[66:37.85]Game starts in... N. What?
[66:42.24]What do I do?
[66:47.73]Game... Whoa, somebody's... End line with enter or space.
[66:50.99]Did I type this?
[66:56.00]Shift is optional for capitals.
[67:03.43]Ah, he's gonna kill me!
[67:05.01]Shift is optional for...
[67:09.33]I'm dead.
[67:17.38]I think I have it reversed.
[67:21.14]Okay, I'm good.
[67:25.79]Round one cleared.
[67:28.42]Am I playing with other people right now?
[67:34.77]Empty line ends a round.
[67:38.87]Oh, fuck you.
[67:45.00]Dude, I just got a sick, I got a sick new computer and a sick new keyboard for this.
[67:50.25]What?
[67:51.49]Did I get it wrong?
[67:54.28]Mistakes.
[68:06.20]Three mistakes start roulette.
[68:09.40]Uh oh.
[68:23.52]What is this fucked up world?
[68:25.14]I just came in third place out of how many people?
[68:35.00]Dude, my words per minute were 48.
[68:36.90]My accuracy was almost 100%.
[68:38.46]That's crazy.
[68:43.57]Oh, let's go.
[68:44.23]This is fun.
[68:48.41]Alright, I gotta set up for this.
[68:52.62]So I'm playing against other people.
[68:53.78]I don't make mistakes.
[68:56.62]I can see the leaderboard if I hit tab.
[68:59.01]Oh, shit.
[68:59.71]Okay.
[69:01.15]Alright, let's do it.
[69:07.11]I'm going to quiet up.
[69:17.17]What are you talking about?
[69:17.97]Oh, there's a period.
[69:30.47]Now let's add commas, dashes, dots.
[69:34.57]I'm sorry it fucked me up.
[69:39.68]Failing here is fucking bad, isn't it?
[69:41.76]That's not a good place to lose, man.
[69:55.09]The timer on the table shows time left.
[70:02.56]If it hits zero, bang bang.
[70:05.23]Oops!
[70:09.55]Comma?
[70:09.91]No.
[70:13.46]The man in the black coat shoots.
[70:19.42]Oh, fucking eat my ass!
[70:27.89]Ugh!
[70:29.72]Above the text are squares.
[70:36.92]I gotta do quick.
[70:51.69]Three mistakes, Russian roulette.
[70:58.10]Oh no, he's gonna kill me.
[71:00.92]Don't do it.
[71:08.98]oh dude you know what here's my problem this is my biggest problem with typing okay my issue has always been I can type fast but my fingers I have to look my fingers let's say I want to press t I will move to t and I will push in the space in between e and y
[71:36.36]A lot of times.
[71:37.92]I go in between.
[71:40.00]I almost slide through and press in between.
[71:46.60]And I think I know what's happened to me over the last 20 years.
[71:50.30]Mesh keyboards became way less popular.
[71:53.79]When I say mesh keyboard, a lot of you know what I'm talking about.
[71:56.73]Mechanical keyboards and individual depression-based keyboards with the switches and individual buttons spread out a little more is where I have the issue.
[72:12.65]I can type really well on a membrane or mesh keyboard.
[72:16.97]But it's the fact that this is for gaming.
[72:20.10]Mechanical keyboards for me, perfect.
[72:22.00]Because it's individual buttons.
[72:24.68]But I...
[72:25.88]It is COPE.
[72:26.50]I know it is.
[72:34.45]Okay, here we go.
[72:36.60]Progress has been made.
[72:37.30]Time to test all keys.
[72:41.50]I fucking hate myself.
[72:49.59]See, I did it!
[72:50.19]I skipped the fucking T key!
[73:00.15]Numbers first.
[73:05.00]Look at where I am!
[73:05.70]I'm so far behind!
[73:06.56]Letters next.
[73:16.59]Oh god.
[73:20.53]I have to press T, which means I've hit Y twice.
[73:32.60]Oh, somebody died!
[73:37.77]Okay.
[73:41.59]Now symbols.
[73:45.20]The guy that got in the first place when we needed to do periods.
[73:47.98]I feel bad for him.
[73:52.96]What is that?
[73:53.46]What is that?
[73:53.88]What is it?
[73:54.18]What is it?
[73:54.48]What is that?
[73:54.82]What is that?
[73:55.54]What is it?
[73:55.98]What is that?
[73:56.38]I can't see it.
[73:58.35]What is that?
[73:59.59]What is it?
[73:59.91]A period?
[74:01.49]I can't... My resolution's too high.
[74:03.16]What is it?
[74:05.22]My resolution's too high.
[74:06.00]I don't know what that is.
[74:08.57]I literally can't see it from here.
[74:10.59]They're all dots.
[74:12.67]Fuck.
[74:20.77]Hey, that's alright.
[74:21.67]I'm right in the middle.
[74:26.94]What happened?
[74:27.64]Why am I still lying here?
[74:33.79]Oh, well.
[74:37.10]Did I get booted?
[74:37.64]Oh, okay.
[74:44.31]Okay, what is the average typing speed for a 40-year-old man from the United States of America?
[74:50.88]31 words per minute.
[75:03.14]I could have just got one guide.
[75:04.96]It's not 90.
[75:06.04]Get out of here.
[75:06.68]90 words per minute, you are brinking crack.
[75:15.39]U.S. is 20.
[75:16.43]Outside is probably, alright.
[75:18.14]My average is like 42.
[75:19.02]I could just look this up, you know.
[75:22.50]I'm just gonna look it up.
[75:23.06]I don't trust anybody.
[75:27.09]Let's see.
[75:28.47]Okay, what is average typing speed in the U.S.?
[75:37.88]The average typing speed in the U.S. is around 40 words per minute.
[75:41.42]Look at that.
[75:46.97]40 words per minute is the average.
[75:48.93]Touch typists average over 50 words per minute.
[75:52.21]And a speed of 60 words per minute or more is considered productive for office work.
[75:56.90]I'm at 50 WPM.
[76:03.17]I'll do it again.
[76:07.82]I only type with...
[76:09.88]I guess I could tell you.
[76:11.80]Oh, the server's down?
[76:13.91]Oh, no.
[76:15.07]Servers are down.
[76:24.82]There we go.
[76:28.66]I'm going to really try this time.
[76:41.10]Why did I start typing banana?
[76:44.59]Just kill me.
[76:45.31]I typed B for banana.
[76:46.35]It's always banana.
[76:57.69]It's always funny when somebody gets out fucking immediately.
[77:01.74]Oh my god.
[77:03.42]I think I'll be alright on this one.
[77:19.40]Oh.
[77:29.04]Let me get through the alphabet, come on.
[77:32.27]Wait, what?
[77:35.15]Somebody already got to Z?
[77:39.28]I just typed in the word moon and somebody's already on xylophone?
[77:50.40]Oh my god.
[77:57.90]I only made two mistakes.
[77:59.26]That was a bad one.
[78:00.34]When you have to move around like that, it's hard.
[78:07.07]There's no way I'm going to win any of these.
[78:12.57]It went down.
[78:13.19]Okay, here's all I care about.
[78:16.12]I don't type.
[78:18.60]What is the average senior citizen typing speed?
[78:28.48]in the United States.
[78:34.02]While there's no definitive universally agreed upon figure, research suggests that the average typing speed for adults age 65 and over is between 25 to 30 words per minute.
[78:47.21]Okay.
[78:48.92]As long as I don't fall below that, I'm good.
[78:53.84]These are AI answers?
[78:55.44]Are they?
[78:55.80]Maybe it is an AI answer.
[78:59.09]That's the AI overview.
[79:02.71]What do you want me to say?
[79:04.15]I typed it into fucking Google.
[79:07.82]Alright, here we go.
[79:13.46]What?
[79:14.34]Not a period.
[79:19.07]But not why not.
[79:19.97]But not not why.
[79:23.69]But not not why.
[79:28.55]When yes is no... Then...
[79:39.83]If...
[79:39.95]Okay.
[79:40.07]This is some Yoda-type shit here.
[79:42.07]You do not, but done.
[79:47.70]You not do.
[79:53.35]Make without made.
[79:55.54]Oh my God, I'm going to smash this keyboard.
[79:57.68]No, I'm not.
[79:58.02]I love this thing.
[80:01.66]Was is will before now.
[80:07.29]I is you, but you not me.
[80:13.03]Like a caveman wrote this.
[80:15.33]Like a caveman editorial.
[80:16.94]I is you, but you not me.
[80:21.62]They am inside the think.
[80:27.60]No B.
[80:28.32]No do.
[80:28.86]No mean.
[80:29.30]Yes?
[80:37.55]Dude, keep the caveman shit up.
[80:39.07]I can do it better.
[80:40.07]When you get rid of this stuff and you make it... Oh, man.
[80:44.29]I'm better at the caveman typing.
[80:47.00]Oh!
[80:55.80]That was everybody.
[81:00.00]That was the entire room of everyone.
[81:03.48]Just got annihilated.
[81:07.09]Okay, I'll do two or three more.
[81:08.33]This game's great.
[81:08.93]I like it.
[81:09.87]These have been three great demos so far.
[81:12.25]Fun.
[81:14.33]I'm surprised this is even a demo.
[81:15.40]This feels just like a game.
[81:18.80]I don't know what they're going to add to this, but this feels just like a game that you would play right now.
[81:23.64]That would be popular.
[81:24.73]So, I wish them luck.
[81:36.46]why is it wrong but not not why how did somebody tell me how did you fail so quickly man you're messing it up everybody else dude that guy it up for me so bad like how he lost instantly I need to turn off the audio
[82:10.89]You not do but done.
[82:16.46]I keep forgetting the periods.
[82:25.55]Was his will before now?
[82:31.65]Just shoot me OK, just do it.
[82:38.64]Oh my goodness.
[82:42.65]I...
[82:52.60]I is you, but you not me.
[82:57.65]I is you, but you not me.
[83:03.82]What the fuck are you talking about, man?
[83:11.08]They am inside the thing.
[83:16.18]No be, no do, no mean.
[83:25.03]Whatever.
[83:26.45]Congratulations.
[83:28.18]Player 32, you have won.
[83:30.90]The other players will now
[83:32.46]Yeah, whatever.
[83:33.50]You give me a microphone.
[83:34.67]Let's do it the other way.
[83:35.63]You give me a microphone, you give me a script to read.
[83:38.01]Let's do it like that.
[83:39.21]We perform on fucking camera.
[83:40.71]How does that sound?
[83:41.23]You want to try that?
[83:42.19]How about I read it?
[83:43.21]How about I read it and read it well and read it with a fucking passion with performance.
[83:47.52]Let's see what place I place then.
[83:49.08]You want to see what place I place then?
[83:55.26]You give me a roll.
[83:57.40]Give me a Shakespeare roll.
[83:58.17]I'll go up there and do it.
[83:58.79]I'll be in first place.
[84:00.61]Sorry, I can't type very well.
[84:11.09]Caveman brained theater kid.
[84:14.92]Alright, here we go.
[84:16.64]What does the dog say?
[84:17.48]Woof woof.
[84:25.27]What the fuck?
[84:26.63]I can't be the guy that goes out first.
[84:28.61]I can't be the guy that makes everybody laugh.
[84:30.30]That's what he did to me.
[84:33.58]What does the dog say?
[84:42.82]What does the cat say?
[84:44.72]Remember you all liked that song?
[84:52.23]Yeah, I do.
[84:52.85]I remember when you all used to sing that shit.
[84:56.44]Fucking everywhere you went.
[84:57.68]I'd hear it at drive-thru.
[84:58.88]I'd hear it at the fucking...
[85:00.24]I'd hear it at Walmart.
[85:02.44]Everybody sang that song.
[85:04.25]Oh no, you were so funny when you did.
[85:19.92]What is the frog?
[85:35.31]Oh, that was my buddy in front of me.
[85:37.16]What does the horse say?
[85:42.41]Argh!
[85:51.78]What does the B say?
[85:53.07]It's going to be buzz.
[86:02.48]What does the mouse say?
[86:10.95]Oh, boy.
[86:15.78]I spelled it wrong.
[86:16.94]Please don't kill me.
[86:27.52]39th place.
[86:29.15]That's okay though.
[86:32.67]Out of 100?
[86:39.04]Out of 40?
[86:41.89]What?
[86:47.20]No way.
[86:48.08]That's crazy, man.
[86:50.92]I'm sorry.
[86:51.64]There's no way.
[86:58.14]Three words per minute.
[86:59.16]I'm at 50 words per minute.
[87:00.56]I don't know.
[87:01.42]How can I compete?
[87:03.78]I talk into a microphone.
[87:05.52]I don't type into a microphone.
[87:08.73]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[87:12.19]How about this one?
[87:15.54]Good afternoon, dear support team.
[87:18.54]I wish to report a serious problem.
[87:20.76]I kindly ask for...
[87:23.22]I'm doing it my way!
[87:26.98]It ain't gonna do it.
[87:27.86]It ain't gonna go off.
[87:28.98]It ain't gonna go off!
[87:38.03]What?
[87:40.67]Whatever, just kill me.
[87:48.18]I feel like it's weighted.
[87:50.86]Dude, I...
[87:51.24]I hit an S and shit.
[87:55.05]I threw it on purpose in the beginning.
[88:13.69]Or I cannot resolve it on my own.
[88:29.16]This is what happens to me on fucking Discord and shit too, man.
[88:31.71]Like, I will...
[88:32.89]This is what I do.
[88:34.25]I am substance, not reason.
[88:37.18]Do you know what I'm saying?
[88:37.84]Like, I'm substance.
[88:39.51]I am substance, vision, no reason.
[88:43.08]Let me tell you something.
[88:44.18]I will sit there and I'll write up like five paragraphs on like a Discord message I don't even give a what it looks like I'm just going let's see I'm gonna get this down whatever what I'm writing I'm writing a whole thing here boom throw it up puke it out substance here's what I wanted to say here's what I wanted to be I wanted to look like this I wanted to sound like this I want to be like this here's what's gonna happen next scene bingo exterior here he comes
[89:07.45]Let me tell you something.
[89:08.69]After you do that, I don't give a fuck what it looks like.
[89:11.45]When I'm done, I'll go over all the bullshit.
[89:14.14]There'll be a bunch of misspellings, there'll be a bunch of run-on sentences, there'll be a bunch of grown-up bullshit.
[89:18.49]I will go clean it up, I'll make it look good, and then I will present it.
[89:23.01]Okay?
[89:26.80]Almost everything I ever send to anybody is edited.
[89:30.62]not because I'm trying to change the narrative because I am stupid and I just type too fast I puke all my thoughts up in an hour use speech to text alright I'm gonna actually try this time
[89:52.76]You proofread?
[89:53.78]Congratulations?
[89:55.66]No, I'm saying like, I have no where at all.
[89:58.55]I don't care at all about if there's any mistakes at all.
[90:02.03]It looks like fucking shit.
[90:03.41]It looks like a child wrote it.
[90:05.17]And then I go through and I make it look like a man wrote it.
[90:17.15]Why would I add a fucking shift on that?
[90:22.27]Dude, I... Why would there be an R in there?
[90:37.14]I hate this.
[90:51.21]Again, it's going to change it up on me and I'm not going to look.
[90:54.36]I must not tell lies.
[91:10.23]God damn it.
[91:20.44]Again, same thing?
[91:21.64]Uh-oh.
[91:50.39]No!
[91:50.95]I want to get in a higher place than this!
[91:52.24]Let me go!
[91:52.74]No!
[91:52.98]I got 14.
[92:00.64]14 out of 37?
[92:01.43]That's perfectly fine.
[92:11.96]Whatever, 16th.
[92:13.12]That's right in the middle.
[92:14.96]Whoa, what happened here?
[92:18.05]I turned up for this one.
[92:19.45]72 words per minute.
[92:26.83]Alright, let's do one more.
[92:27.95]And then I'm going to move on.
[92:30.13]But I like this one a lot.
[92:31.13]This one's fun.
[92:33.40]I'm going to really dial in for this one.
[92:36.82]Okay, that's a fatal error.
[92:38.83]Okay.
[92:40.45]Well, I guess we're moving on now.
[92:49.32]Holly just said, I want to see you on the microphone version of the game.
[92:53.43]There should be one of these where everybody gets one paragraph they have to act out.
[92:59.95]And it's based on... No, it can't be audience voting.
[93:04.60]It has to be something like baked into the system.
[93:11.24]That one was great.
[93:14.38]Okay, I might go to the bathroom.
[93:16.59]I think it's a quick break.
[93:18.05]I'm going to keep going.
[93:20.76]That sounds good to me.
[93:21.77]I'll be back in two or three minutes and we'll play some more.
[93:24.80]See you in a minute.
[99:23.98]Hello.
[99:25.78]How are you?
[99:29.96]We're back.
[99:31.81]There are a few more things I would like to play.
[99:34.17]I got a lot.
[99:36.83]Alright.
[99:40.16]I was on the front page of the Steam Next Fest and I was just kind of getting stuff and then I took some ones from chat.
[99:46.85]What about Misery?
[99:49.93]Misery.
[99:51.65]Can I try that?
[99:57.31]Go back to Bubsy 4D.
[99:59.45]I already did Bubsy 4D.
[100:00.37]It was great.
[100:08.28]Let me open it.
[100:08.82]Every single person.
[100:14.25]Oh, yeah.
[100:17.16]I made a coffee.
[100:17.98]Sounds delicious.
[100:22.30]Kind of really just wanted one.
[100:23.18]It just felt like a coffee kind of afternoon.
[100:24.83]You know how sometimes it's about 4 or 5 o'clock?
[100:28.05]You know what?
[100:28.61]It's time for one.
[100:29.69]I've been very good.
[100:30.51]I'm doing a lot less caffeine.
[100:31.96]Usually do one coffee a day, sometimes no, and do decaf.
[100:36.06]This is a full caff kind of day.
[100:38.79]Alright.
[100:39.01]I don't know how loud it's going to be.
[100:39.85]Be careful.
[100:40.25]It could be loud.
[100:46.70]Alright.
[100:46.94]Misery.
[100:47.20]Thanks for participating in the Misery public demo.
[100:49.98]Survival mode will be unlimited.
[100:51.62]Gameplay is limited to 10 in-game emissions and includes only a portion of the planned content.
[100:57.50]Okay.
[100:58.54]Solo developer.
[101:01.54]Very cool.
[101:02.16]Alright.
[101:09.95]How does it do?
[101:10.83]Is it multiplayer?
[101:18.30]Hold on.
[101:18.56]Let me turn it.
[101:21.75]Oh, no head Bob.
[101:27.06]Fine.
[101:30.69]Fine.
[101:34.06]Okay.
[101:44.80]When was the last time that I won?
[101:53.49]Is this like a multiplayer game?
[101:55.89]Should I play this with the boys?
[101:59.46]Maybe I should play this with the boys.
[102:01.74]This looks like it's a 5 person multiplayer game.
[102:08.15]Hmm.
[102:09.31]Alright, hold on to this one.
[102:11.66]This looks like it could be fun.
[102:12.50]It looks like there's 4 people that can play it.
[102:15.08]This doesn't look like a solo type game.
[102:18.01]Okay, well I'll keep that in mind.
[102:20.61]Uh, we also have...
[102:24.83]Uh, Tarn or Cairn?
[102:29.35]Cairn.
[102:30.64]It's like a climbing game.
[102:34.02]Controller recommended.
[102:35.00]Okay.
[102:41.33]Sounds good.
[102:47.16]It's very pretty.
[102:51.29]I'm going to be setting Zandy for a second.
[103:00.21]Uh, HUD.
[103:01.01]Immersive.
[103:01.48]Uh, manual limb selection.
[103:05.10]That's fine.
[103:05.68]Let's keep default.
[103:08.80]Everything's on high.
[103:09.55]Everything looks good.
[103:10.23]Looks good.
[103:11.67]Targeting, uh, targeting 90.
[103:14.35]Targeting 180 FPS.
[103:17.86]And we're going to put it on high quality.
[103:19.34]Looks good.
[103:19.82]It looks good.
[103:20.40]Everything looks good.
[103:21.28]Okay.
[103:22.92]How's it sound?
[103:23.38]Sound good?
[103:26.85]Turn it up a little bit, maybe?
[103:31.01]Story.
[103:33.71]Difficulty.
[103:34.39]Explorer.
[103:36.20]I'll do the middle.
[103:38.42]Survival is balanced.
[103:39.46]Climb with your gear.
[103:40.80]Pitons.
[103:41.88]Save your progress.
[103:42.88]Okay.
[103:45.31]There is a special event happening in Karen's demo.
[103:47.77]You can see the ghosts of other players.
[103:50.61]Um.
[103:52.46]Should I keep it on?
[103:56.04]Is it going to be distracting?
[103:59.60]Okay.
[103:59.90]Fine.
[104:10.60]Is that me?
[104:13.10]Looks like Borderlands.
[104:24.83]She touched her nose to the ground.
[104:36.42]That's...
[104:38.44]You can tell how old I am because doing that would be like, I'm not even going to try to do that.
[104:48.12]I feel like 10, 20 years ago, I probably would have tried to do that and been like, maybe I can.
[104:52.18]Okay, here we go.
[105:01.96]Oh my God, that's a million people.
[105:06.57]Do we really want to see all this?
[105:10.84]I can't even see the wall!
[105:15.89]Okay, so move limb, and then climb.
[105:24.46]Wait a second, dude, hold on.
[105:31.31]I think you- okay, it's left is every limb, you just have to lock in place?
[105:39.92]Okay, interesting.
[105:49.91]Well won.
[106:03.45]I actually like the you kind of lock in place.
[106:08.62]It looks like it goes around in a circle.
[106:09.94]It's like, do you have two feet?
[106:12.75]Maybe not.
[106:13.49]Left hand, left foot.
[106:15.99]Right hand, right foot, I think.
[106:20.56]No?
[106:21.52]Is it, like, smart calculating?
[106:26.99]Uh, that's interesting.
[106:35.30]Well, it worked, so whatever.
[106:46.90]This is a sprint.
[106:51.70]Alright, I gotta get up.
[106:52.31]I gotta get past these chumps.
[107:15.62]Alright, now I'm gonna do it for real.
[107:17.40]Why is this person floating?
[107:20.14]That person just got killed.
[107:23.25]Why did I just get a weird death animation from that person?
[107:36.53]Okay, right there.
[107:43.08]Good.
[107:46.82]Good.
[107:49.76]This is cool.
[107:50.56]I like this.
[107:51.46]This is fun.
[107:53.77]I feel like it's going to be very difficult, but whatever.
[107:55.49]Right there.
[108:02.25]This way.
[108:12.08]Place a piton.
[108:17.11]Okay.
[108:18.99]This is like a checkpoint.
[108:20.73]Planting pittons regularly will help you secure your ascent.
[108:23.24]But beware, you have a limited supply.
[108:24.60]You can retrieve them once you are on solid ground.
[108:28.43]When you plant a pitton, you can go off belay.
[108:31.89]In a resting position, you'll recover stamina.
[108:34.74]I don't know what any of that means.
[108:37.00]I think it's just a rest point.
[108:39.85]Off belay.
[108:42.63]Here we go.
[108:47.43]Okay, climb.
[108:49.10]Okay, I'm ready.
[108:56.53]You don't have to go fast really, do you?
[108:58.05]Not really.
[109:01.09]Oh, I fucked it up here.
[109:07.86]Right here.
[109:08.52]I gotta reach up my leg.
[109:10.49]Right there in that spot.
[109:11.53]There we go.
[109:16.59]There we go.
[109:21.76]Get out of here.
[109:22.22]This is my spot.
[109:29.55]Uh, I'm like panting.
[109:35.78]I'm climbing on smooth rock.
[109:37.64]I gotta go quick.
[109:42.01]Rest right here.
[109:42.53]Rest, rest, rest.
[109:43.87]Rest.
[109:52.18]I was climbing up a wall like Spider-Man.
[110:03.69]Right there.
[110:04.11]I can't fall now, right?
[110:19.69]Is this... Am I doing alright?
[110:25.11]Here we go.
[110:25.53]Right there.
[110:30.70]Here we go.
[110:32.64]I gotta get that left leg up.
[110:34.14]That right leg's gotta come up right now.
[110:36.57]I'm very uncomfortable.
[110:37.41]My character's freaking out.
[110:38.15]My control is vibrating.
[110:40.95]Oh.
[110:41.43]Uh oh.
[110:42.63]That's not good.
[110:44.25]This is bad.
[110:52.76]I mean... What was that?
[110:59.29]Recall.
[110:59.94]Ah, there we go.
[111:01.34]Outside of the climbing gym, serious injuries can be fatal.
[111:05.30]Find a site and pitch your tent to save your progress.
[111:07.25]Okay.
[111:08.41]They're right here.
[111:15.70]Nice.
[111:18.36]Thanks.
[111:26.06]Is this a strand type game?
[111:28.68]Wait, I can cook food?
[111:33.27]This is not just a climbing game.
[111:34.61]This is a cook food game.
[111:35.86]I can make chocolate milk.
[111:45.15]Chocolate drink.
[111:45.87]Hot chocolate.
[111:46.49]Not the best setting to enjoy it, but who can say no to chocolate?
[111:52.92]nice alright what about chocolate and chocolate double chocolate drink intense chocolate nice okay how about chocolate drink and noodles gross extra sweet chocolate noodles
[112:28.66]Where's boiled water?
[112:33.91]Clear water.
[112:34.67]Alright.
[112:36.07]I think I'm good.
[112:40.80]Uh, tape fingers.
[112:45.33]What?
[112:45.51]Select a finger?
[112:51.09]I think they're already taped.
[112:56.39]I can also repair my pittance.
[113:01.94]I don't think I have pittance scraps or whatever it is.
[113:06.71]Okay, open bag.
[113:07.41]Whoa, okay.
[113:10.03]This is weird.
[113:12.01]This is my shit?
[113:13.14]I shit in a bag and keep it with me, right?
[113:22.29]Muscle relaxer?
[113:26.60]Alright, I think I was going to go.
[113:28.18]This is way more in depth than I thought it was going to be.
[113:35.59]I'll be happy if I get halfway up where that orange guy on the right is.
[113:41.90]Oh, that person is dead.
[113:44.54]Sorry, dude.
[113:45.68]Good luck next time.
[113:51.32]Incoming call.
[113:52.54]Alright, I'm thinking right side looks dangerous, but I think it's... We're going right side.
[114:04.23]I'm not gonna go... That's a smooth surface right there.
[114:10.18]Yeah, that was a bad place to start.
[114:12.18]Look at how smooth it is over there.
[114:17.65]Yeah, you're in deep shit.
[114:19.35]It's a smooth surface.
[114:23.03]This guy's in trouble.
[114:26.27]I'm picking right here.
[114:27.93]This is my spot.
[114:33.52]Alright, let me get up here.
[114:37.95]I could climb this no problem.
[114:40.27]I don't think I would.
[114:44.82]What happened?
[114:54.84]Alright, stay on this surface here.
[114:56.18]Alright, can I pull myself up?
[115:11.85]Here we go.
[115:15.25]Yeah.
[115:16.44]Perfect.
[115:18.14]Alright, how far?
[115:18.74]Okay, I want to...
[115:20.14]I'm going to trend more to the right side.
[115:21.44]Whew.
[115:29.35]Not quite yet.
[115:30.01]Get your whole body to the right.
[115:34.61]There you go.
[115:35.85]Alright, let's move.
[115:39.86]Come on, grab it.
[115:44.06]Swing your leg up.
[115:48.03]Come on.
[115:52.57]God damn it.
[115:55.78]This is not...
[115:56.38]I gotta move.
[115:57.16]Right there.
[115:58.24]Okay.
[115:59.67]Alright, take a breather.
[116:03.09]What, did you see a problem with this way?
[116:04.68]Why are you coming back down?
[116:10.10]Why is he coming back down?
[116:25.97]Oh, you are fucking dead.
[116:29.07]Oh no!
[116:33.44]I'm sat there laughing at that person.
[116:34.98]It's going to get me killed.
[116:45.91]Right there.
[116:47.25]Come on.
[116:48.13]Grab it.
[116:50.35]Alright.
[116:50.59]Sit here and rest.
[116:53.72]He wants me to do a pittin.
[116:54.88]We don't need a pittin.
[116:55.62]What are you talking about?
[116:56.24]We're good.
[117:00.00]Not on this entry level shit.
[117:21.78]None of this shaky hand shit.
[117:23.83]Alright, sit right here.
[117:24.41]You're good.
[117:25.87]Rest.
[117:27.27]Oh, great.
[117:29.17]I have an idea.
[117:34.20]How do I, um... Where's my inventory?
[117:38.23]Where's my inventory?
[117:41.43]I want to eat the soup.
[117:42.47]The chocolate soup that's in my... Use a pit in here?
[117:52.70]You have to do a vertical limit jump.
[117:56.57]Inventory is B.
[117:59.04]You fucking asshole.
[118:12.71]I...
[118:14.62]I...
[118:16.00]It's not hold V for you.
[118:17.82]I can't believe I listened to that one guy.
[118:19.57]Why did I do that?
[118:21.95]I can't fucking believe it.
[118:24.20]People might think that I did that on purpose.
[118:26.46]But I genuinely was like, well, pressing B didn't work.
[118:29.49]I guess I have to hold it.
[118:51.79]That's my- this is my journey?
[118:54.46]Okay.
[118:55.44]Why did he do that?
[118:59.42]Oh my god.
[119:05.57]It's- I don't even have an explanation as to how that happened.
[119:10.99]It's like I walked- I just fell off and decided, you know what?
[119:14.40]I'm gonna go this way.
[119:15.44]Did I not see that the world ended and I just walked off the bridge?
[119:18.68]Was I trying to take a selfie or something?
[119:22.90]Alright, let me try for real again.
[119:28.12]I like this one.
[119:32.50]I was doing fine.
[119:36.73]It almost looks like I bounced up and over when I came down the first time.
[119:44.52]Berries.
[119:48.98]Oh, it's down on the D-pad.
[119:51.52]Thanks a lot, guys.
[120:06.40]I'm going left side.
[120:10.12]You're the one that's playing the game.
[120:15.53]Don't blame us.
[120:18.40]I'm blaming the one guy.
[120:19.92]Oh, cool.
[120:24.61]You can observe with LB.
[120:28.47]That's cool.
[120:32.12]Alright.
[120:38.19]I'm going straight up the left side here.
[120:40.25]I'm just gonna get up there.
[120:42.82]We're going.
[120:43.38]Fuck it.
[120:46.32]You gotta have confidence at some point, right?
[120:56.48]Like, get that climbing confidence here.
[121:10.07]Always plant your feet down.
[121:11.25]Grab it.
[121:20.00]Good.
[121:21.13]Secure.
[121:22.49]Rest.
[121:23.25]Secure.
[121:24.37]Rest.
[121:27.36]Holy shit, that looks scary.
[121:33.26]Are they going to make it?
[121:38.87]I want to do that.
[121:40.12]Can I go up that way?
[121:40.98]I'll try going up that way.
[121:48.95]Okay, let's go.
[122:07.78]Um, this is- this ain't working.
[122:11.73]Why can't I- I need to move my legs.
[122:17.51]Dude, why can't I move my left leg?
[122:39.74]Oh!
[122:40.86]No, no, no, no, no!
[122:42.89]What happened?
[122:43.31]Is she alright?
[122:44.43]Did I just pass out?
[122:46.01]No, okay, it's the same now.
[122:51.04]I just heard...
[123:09.39]Get up there.
[123:11.39]Yeah!
[123:13.76]Alright, now we're going up this way.
[123:16.26]There's a lot of crevices to go up here.
[123:17.74]It just looks a little dangerous.
[123:24.79]Bring some water.
[123:27.01]Let's eat that soup.
[123:32.06]Compost it?
[123:35.71]Maybe I should hold on to the plastic wrap.
[123:38.27]Oh, I got a burst of speed!
[123:51.53]Whoa the swear words.
[123:56.49]I'm so sorry guys.
[123:57.78]That's crazy Reach reach Reach
[124:23.52]There's no way to put my hands here.
[124:30.82]You can reach that.
[124:38.75]There we go.
[124:39.29]Okay.
[124:40.51]Place hands here.
[124:41.31]And then wrap around this way.
[124:48.58]Like this.
[124:55.48]There we go.
[124:57.97]Perfect.
[125:01.19]Let me see.
[125:01.87]There's a little ledge right there.
[125:03.24]Is that guy going for the honey?
[125:17.04]Oh, that person.
[125:19.30]I blame that person.
[125:20.82]You fucked me up.
[125:21.98]So, alright.
[125:22.77]Can I push somebody off?
[125:26.79]They did a WWF wrestling off the top rope squandive in front of the camera.
[125:32.40]And it blew what I was doing.
[125:38.82]They had to just dive in front of the camera and make us all go, what the hell?
[125:51.92]Wait, maybe they weren't.
[125:52.95]Maybe that wasn't on purpose.
[125:57.53]How dare you die in front of me and stress me out and distract me from what I was doing?
[126:16.56]Come on, keep going.
[126:25.23]See if I can pass them.
[126:26.87]It'd be huge if I can get in front of them.
[126:37.33]Fuck you!
[126:38.05]Oh my god, that was so stupid!
[126:39.83]Just do it normally!
[127:06.50]Okay, sit here for a second.
[127:09.43]Rest.
[127:09.95]Relax.
[127:12.83]There's other paths up.
[127:14.33]Yeah, but I want to go up this one.
[127:16.23]This one has so many bumpy rocks on it.
[127:30.79]Where's my hand?
[127:32.11]There we go.
[127:32.37]Alright, come on.
[127:32.81]Get up there.
[127:36.00]Pull yourself up!
[127:39.76]Alright, good.
[127:42.81]Look at how much bumps there is here.
[127:44.65]And I'll use a pit and up here too.
[127:46.35]Everything will be fine.
[127:47.57]I need to eat some food or water or something.
[128:02.17]Alright, let's go.
[128:08.33]There's so many slots to put my hands here.
[128:17.62]Alright, rest.
[128:22.15]Uh-oh, I can't rest.
[128:26.38]Okay, now I can rest.
[128:27.50]Rest.
[128:42.50]Right there, good.
[128:44.65]Lot right there.
[128:50.86]Lot right here, rest.

[128:56.23]Ah!

[129:07.88]Okay, what do I want to go, left probably?
[129:22.94]grip grip grip grip grip hold on hold on hold on hold on hold the leg hold the leg please hold the leg please hold the leg
[129:57.83]Oh, please, no!

[130:06.69]What am I doing?
[130:09.53]Rest!

[130:11.61]Rest!
[130:13.45]Rest, rest, rest!
[130:15.04]Rest!
[130:21.81]God damn it!
[130:23.05]Oh, I'm just walking, I'm taking the bike trail, whatever.
[130:29.17]Give me a fucking break.
[130:33.84]Alright, Julia, let's go.
[130:34.92]You and me.
[130:38.20]I'm gonna just eat all my chocolate.
[130:48.78]I forgot to put a piton in.
[130:49.68]I forgot they existed.
[130:50.38]Oh my god, I'm an idiot.
[131:08.73]Okay, I'm gonna rest up here.
[131:21.06]And then left side.
[131:29.38]Right there.
[131:30.07]Stay right here.
[131:31.17]Okay.
[131:33.89]I think it is up.
[131:34.77]Straight up.
[131:57.12]Okay, pittin'.
[131:59.89]Is it too early for a pittin'?
[132:13.13]It's not B for pittin'.
[132:16.66]Okay, let's go.
[132:18.16]I'm almost at the second tier.
[132:28.21]Lime.
[132:40.58]Good rest up here.
[132:41.62]Almost there, don't screw it up.
[132:57.28]This is going to be actually difficult.
[132:58.26]I don't know if I can do it from here.
[133:00.11]I'm going to have to just go for it.
[133:06.64]Got it.
[133:09.69]Good.
[133:10.11]I think I can rest right here.
[133:13.03]Careful.
[133:17.42]You don't got a lot of options here.
[133:21.16]That's a good move.
[133:22.76]Good move.
[133:23.24]Slow it down.
[133:24.99]Easy.
[133:25.61]Nice, dude.
[133:27.01]Nice job.
[133:32.12]Get out of my fucking way.
[133:33.40]Get out of here.
[133:34.74]Go find your own rock.
[133:36.44]Look at how big this rock is.
[133:37.40]This rock is giant.
[133:40.27]You have to pick my spot for the rock.
[133:43.03]Go find your own rock side.
[133:49.32]There's like 600 million square feet of rock.
[134:06.12]Imagine somebody yelling that at you when you're climbing.
[134:09.22]Get out of here!
[134:09.78]This is my rock!
[134:10.58]Go find your own rock to climb!
[134:17.09]Alright, I made it.
[134:32.53]Is this a save point?
[134:36.10]Let's go.
[134:37.08]Alright, I'm gonna craft some more stuff.
[134:53.03]How about berries?
[134:54.53]And let's do a chocolate raspberry.
[135:02.92]Drink it.
[135:09.85]Okay, I got full health.
[135:14.08]Still, I only have like...
[135:15.24]I only used one pitton.
[135:16.83]My finger's good?
[135:17.77]Oh, no.
[135:22.82]That does not look good.
[135:26.59]I did jump off the bridge and die.
[135:29.53]So, that's true.
[135:52.58]I'm good.
[135:58.43]What does this even do for me?
[136:00.71]Does it make the grip stronger?
[136:14.57]Do I have enough to do it?
[136:15.47]Okay, I got one more.
[136:16.86]Let's do the thumb.
[136:18.02]We're good.
[136:25.47]Alright.
[136:27.93]Alright, regardless if I fall, we're moving on to the next one after this.
[136:34.76]Alright, I gotta find a good spot.
[136:40.70]That looks pretty good.
[136:43.71]This left side looks okay.
[136:45.09]I don't know.
[136:45.43]I don't love it.
[136:54.24]I'm out of breath.
[136:56.96]I'm gonna do this one because this one has a place to rest.
[137:02.91]Yeah.
[137:04.03]Everyone's going this way for a reason.
[137:28.77]You almost have to move a little faster than you think you do to get to a safe resting position.
[137:40.91]Alright, rest right here.
[137:45.48]Alright, we're... No, no, no.
[137:46.88]I'm trending to the right.
[137:47.64]I don't like that.
[137:48.14]I need to be this way.
[137:50.97]The right side of this rock is not going to help.
[137:55.78]good good good right there right there perfect alright get up I did not I thought that was my hand and it wasn't dude can you pull yourself up you're up you're good
[138:24.17]yeah it's the same trajectory that these people are going I think this is the end of the demo up here alright do I just do I get in somebody's like youtube shorts about this game by just jumping off the edge when I get up there I saw something crazy in climb what's the name of this game so I got to the top of the mountain if you don't know climb is a game where you
[138:54.58]What's the name of the game?
[138:56.20]Cairn.
[138:56.92]Cairn.
[138:59.18]I found this new Steam game on a Steam demo.
[139:00.38]It's called Cairn.
[139:03.89]When I got to the top, I was not prepared for what I was going to see.
[139:08.25]Watch to the end of the video.
[139:09.93]Like it's a long fucking time.
[139:11.32]The video is 40 seconds long.
[139:15.00]Make sure you watch to the end of the video.
[139:16.68]It's 40 seconds.
[139:20.02]I fucking hate computers.
[139:27.75]I was thinking about getting more involved in YouTube.
[139:45.01]Remember I told you before I was here, I went, hold on, I gotta, gimme a pittin', gimme a pittin', pittin'.
[139:52.86]There's a few video ideas that I've kinda had that I thought would be funny.
[139:58.92]There's also the whole thing with being more aware of that space.
[140:03.49]Because I have a second channel.
[140:04.83]I've got a bunch of editors.
[140:06.63]There's other channels that make videos and highlights and stuff.
[140:11.36]And with all the AI videos and shit, I gotta get more aware.
[140:15.47]I just gotta get control of my own spaces again.
[140:19.69]And I might make some fucking videos too, for fun.
[140:34.83]Alright, there's one video that I have to make.
[140:36.97]That is probably going to happen.
[140:40.82]At some point here.
[140:42.42]Alright, rest right here.
[140:43.20]Am I good?
[140:44.71]Why is it to be so dark?
[140:45.53]Come on, man.
[140:49.75]You need an Instagram?
[140:50.63]No, I don't want social media accounts.
[140:54.24]That ship has sailed so long ago.
[140:57.77]I'm not starting a social media presence.
[141:01.81]I'm ending my social media presence if you want to talk about where that's going I'm predominantly talking about like short form like Twitter and I just don't do it at all but I do have to be kind of acutely aware of everything else with the YouTube videos and editing and editors and
[141:32.39]Especially, like I said, with all the kind of AI stuff where there could be so much just slop produced.
[141:37.26]I don't even know what is what right now.
[141:39.64]I'm in the process of kind of figuring out what I want my YouTube presence to even be.
[141:45.85]So there are some ideas.
[141:54.56]Stay right here.
[142:05.13]Don't blow it right now.
[142:05.91]I literally am at the end of the demo.
[142:14.34]There's a lot of cool, good editors.
[142:15.88]There are a lot of good editors.
[142:18.95]And I think there are other channels too that I would want to like legitimize as well.
[142:28.40]Get everybody kind of under the same wing.
[142:30.20]Okay, where do I want to go from here?
[142:39.67]I don't want to fuck this up because I just can't see.
[142:41.94]I think I can just pull myself up from here.
[142:46.34]I'm not messing around.
[142:54.79]Let's go.
[142:57.11]Alright, I'm doing it all in one go.
[142:58.88]What the hell was that sound?
[143:01.24]I thought it was a fucking landslide.
[143:04.10]Alright, just go.
[143:06.61]Oh no!
[143:08.33]I'm good, I'm good.
[143:21.94]Oh shit.
[143:24.41]I don't think I can get up this.
[143:25.41]I have to go all the route to the...
[143:26.73]Hold on.
[143:30.49]Oh shit.
[143:32.12]Go this way.
[143:33.58]Oh, this is scary.
[143:34.46]Whatever.
[143:38.78]Okay.
[143:39.12]Reach it.
[143:39.87]Come on.
[143:41.09]Come on, please.
[143:44.53]Come on.
[143:46.07]Come on.
[143:49.78]Stop.
[143:50.04]Rest.
[143:53.06]Where's my hand?
[143:53.60]I'm thirsty!
[144:02.16]Okay.
[144:13.62]Shit, this doesn't look good.
[144:25.56]I don't give a fuck, dude.
[144:26.58]I'm putting another one.
[144:29.85]There's a button for your light.
[144:51.29]It's not B. I'm not pressing B ever again.
[145:03.45]Alright, put my hand down.
[145:04.43]Alright, we're good right here.
[145:07.99]I'm almost there.
[145:08.57]Just get a little bit of stamina.
[145:11.24]And go.
[145:19.32]Plant it, please.
[145:20.31]Why are you crossed up like this?
[145:28.87]Yeah!
[145:29.76]Alright, I did it.
[145:44.10]So now what?
[145:44.90]I just win?
[145:46.54]I did it.
[145:46.90]I beat the demo.
[145:47.67]I'm so proud of myself.
[145:52.21]You climbed the wrong mountain.
[146:03.71]This is going to be good.
[146:05.50]I feel like this is going to be a fun game.
[146:08.96]Very nice.
[146:15.72]Congratulations.
[146:18.45]Oh, this is everything I did.
[146:26.64]Just going to gloss over the fact that I jumped off and just like committed suicide over there on the right.
[146:30.68]Okay, we're going to gloss.
[146:31.49]We're not going to pay attention to that part over there on the right.
[146:34.01]We don't need to see that part.
[146:34.79]We're just we're just going to do this part.
[146:46.71]Cool.
[146:49.57]Very good.
[146:52.73]Excellent.
[147:00.88]Okay, coming up next is... What about this one?
[147:08.99]The Curse of Tethria.
[147:12.63]I picked a handful of random ones.
[147:14.21]This is a pretty random one.
[147:18.60]This is on the front page, I think.
[147:20.92]Find out.
[147:28.29]Review of the gameplay that's still in development.
[147:30.45]Compiling shaders.
[147:41.61]Okay, I'll wait.
[147:44.41]Verse of Tethria.
[147:49.30]Where are you pulling these from?
[147:50.26]Just Steam.
[147:50.90]Steam's next best is going on right now.
[147:53.59]Some of it's from the front page.
[147:54.41]Some of it were cat recommendations that I pulled before the stream.
[147:59.73]Steam.
[148:19.84]You seen any good movies or anything lately?
[148:33.35]Don't talk to me.
[148:34.71]Okay, dude.
[148:35.27]I think we're good to go.
[148:39.84]Hope it's not too loud.
[148:40.86]I'm going to warn you it might be.
[148:44.60]Press any button to start.
[148:47.43]Oh, I'm pressing buttons.
[148:49.05]I ain't doing anything.
[148:53.44]Oh, boy.
[148:54.00]Okay.
[148:55.48]That work?
[148:59.73]Okay, new game.
[149:00.45]Let's do settings.
[149:01.41]Hold on.
[149:04.11]Yeah, yeah.
[149:04.79]Resolution's fine.
[149:05.83]That's fine.
[149:06.41]That's fine.
[149:07.90]Overall looks good.
[149:09.24]Overall looks good.
[149:17.15]Oops, sorry.
[149:21.65]I'm going to use controller.
[149:22.43]I don't even know what kind of game this is.
[149:27.92]Turn it up a little bit.
[149:35.23]Uh-oh.
[149:35.37]Alright, slot one.
[149:41.16]Let's go.
[149:44.82]There are many tales of good and evil, divine heroes versus demonic villains, and the triumph of good over evil.
[149:50.85]The kingdom of Tethria is one such stage.
[149:53.08]Its citizens are forced to bear the evil Cursed King's return with each new age.
[149:58.19]Cursed King cares nothing for Tethria.
[150:00.39]He wishes only to sit at his throne and enjoy its riches.
[150:05.07]In past ages, the Tethryans relied on their heroes to save them.
[150:09.32]However, this time one has yet to appear.
[150:11.54]As the Cursed King's army gathers at their gates, the Tethryans are prepared to defend themselves.
[150:24.99]That's kind of loud, I'm sorry.
[150:32.48]Which one am I?
[150:37.45]Did that guy just turn into a skeleton?
[150:42.04]That's a great sound effect.
[150:56.86]In this age without a hero, we were doomed to fall.
[150:59.81]You who swore an oath to defend this land.
[151:02.19]You are reborn as our champion with our final hope.
[151:05.07]Go forth, walk the hero's path and restore us all.
[151:10.09]Okay, sword.
[151:12.53]Left trigger is focus.
[151:13.64]Is that a... Am I taking fucking screenshots?
[151:21.45]What?
[151:22.33]Okay.
[151:36.55]Whoa.
[151:38.93]Okay, jump attack.
[151:44.99]Alright, there's block two.
[151:46.01]Alright.
[151:51.64]Cool.
[151:52.00]I love the mini-map.
[151:52.94]It's so cute.
[151:58.14]Okay, is it...
[151:58.82]I'll tell you something weird.
[152:00.68]This game is gorgeous.
[152:02.53]Like, all the individual things are very pretty.
[152:05.09]Do you see what I mean?
[152:07.99]Let me go out here.
[152:09.11]Look at this.
[152:14.55]Look at how nice this looks.
[152:16.26]It looks really cool.
[152:23.23]I love the door.
[152:25.93]Okay.
[152:26.31]I need to fucking relax.
[152:36.59]I actually do think it's cute though.
[152:37.81]I like it.
[152:48.61]Oh, that's what the statue was telling me to do!
[152:55.64]How do I pick it up again?
[152:58.18]I want to pick this up.
[153:01.43]There we go, okay.
[153:03.49]Yeah, the statue was saying, hey, this is how you throw stuff.
[153:10.85]That was loud in my ear.
[153:17.02]You could make a Castle of Griffinsteed sequel in Unreal 5.
[153:21.57]I don't know if I'm ready for that one, man.
[153:29.73]And of course, our greatest hero.
[153:35.34]We made sure to make a statue of him to point in a direction where we needed to make sure people knew where to go.
[153:45.88]In case our adventurers got lost.
[153:51.33]Ooh, what's that?
[153:56.44]Can I jump over that?
[154:02.19]There's got to be a secret to get that, right?
[154:08.60]Stop breaking the pots?
[154:09.60]Why not?
[154:14.80]Alright, we're going this way.
[154:19.83]I love the mini-map.
[154:20.83]The mini-map is so great.
[154:23.76]I'm playing a different game over here on the mini-map.
[154:27.38]Okay, well how do I open it?
[154:30.91]Ring the bell.
[154:39.72]This door is locked with the guard's key.
[154:42.97]Alright, we gotta kill the guard.
[154:57.30]I don't know how many screenshots I'm taking, but that's a great sound.
[155:01.20]Okay, can I put a rope here?
[155:10.25]We gotta find the guard.
[155:21.39]Your first instinct is to kill the guard rather than ask?
[155:23.85]It's definitely kill the guard.
[155:30.10]Wait a second.
[155:34.11]Alright, it's teaching me something else.
[155:35.29]There's apparently a... Can I go this way?
[155:42.34]Is this a boss door?
[155:48.15]This is where I came from.
[155:52.57]I just saw the big shiny thing.
[155:55.90]Whoa, the hero is very adept with a sword and shield.
[156:00.39]Oh, I actually have to touch these.
[156:04.52]Rolling, okay, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[156:06.34]Alright, so then what is the other one telling me?
[156:13.33]Here I'll find several tools along the way, such as the grappler that allows them to reach far off places.
[156:19.23]Okay, I need to find the grappler.
[156:21.87]I would imagine it would be in this building, right?
[156:29.02]Where's the grappler?
[156:37.75]I don't see a grappler.
[156:43.30]Is it in the pot?
[156:52.39]I don't think so.
[156:55.50]I don't see a grappler.
[156:57.64]I think I have to find it somewhere else.
[157:12.28]Maybe the grappler was the thing that was behind...
[157:13.82]Hold on, it might be in here.
[157:21.77]If I was a grappler, I'd be right here.
[157:24.06]Yep.
[157:34.57]Um...
[157:39.64]It's very...
[157:40.22]The light is very crazy looking.
[157:43.14]No grappler.
[157:49.75]I need to see what's at the end of this demo.
[157:55.14]We have to find the grappler.
[158:04.35]Can I not fall in this?
[158:05.13]Jump in here.
[158:08.06]Dude, that's the grappler right there.
[158:20.91]Shit!
[158:21.31]Where's the... Was it actually the grappler?
[158:31.10]I don't think it was.
[158:34.45]What does this tutorial say?
[158:45.71]GoPro.
[158:59.20]There's a chest.
[159:04.93]The grappler, bro.
[159:06.79]It's gonna be the grappler.
[159:09.11]It's the key.
[159:10.84]We don't even need the grappler.
[159:12.06]We got the key to the guardhouse.
[159:22.03]Boom.
[159:23.72]Alright, let's go.
[159:29.25]I'm gonna, it's just the game's very loud.
[159:40.51]Ring it.
[159:48.44]Boom.
[159:50.31]Let's go.
[160:03.70]I love that sound.
[160:09.73]I gotta get to the first boss.
[160:14.94]Are they hostile?
[160:20.89]I don't think they're hostile.
[160:37.07]Secret.
[160:41.14]There's no way I'm going to be able to do this, right?
[160:43.78]Oh boy.
[160:55.30]What's at the end of this?
[160:57.40]Grappler.
[160:58.86]Look at that.
[161:02.82]Got it.
[161:04.81]What is it?
[161:07.65]You have picked up a half health.
[161:09.44]You find another half health, you'll gain more health.
[161:16.95]Oh, fuck you.
[161:24.00]I'm getting out of here.
[161:26.33]Alright, well, I'm finding the boss and I'm gonna kick his ass and then we're moving on.
[161:41.94]I think I can shoot this.
[161:52.03]Alright, I'm running straight into the castle.
[161:53.83]If I don't get a boss spawn, then I'm moving on.
[162:00.66]I'm very confident.
[162:01.38]Two hearts, I can do in one.
[162:02.68]Watch.
[162:10.97]Oh, that's where I came from.
[162:13.24]Oops.
[162:13.93]That's my bad.
[162:16.03]Okay.
[162:16.19]We're good.
[162:18.25]That was the... What was it called?
[162:21.84]Something about...
[162:28.45]The Curse of Tethria.
[162:41.16]Alright.
[162:41.34]What else we got?
[162:43.15]We're jumping around now.
[162:44.11]Alright, this one is called... Duobelum de Marionette.
[162:54.36]Duobelum de Marionette?
[163:02.13]Looks like a... Like a... Souls-like?
[163:08.93]Looks kind of crazy.
[163:09.97]Would you be able to try?
[163:24.69]And where is it?
[163:27.28]Ooh, pretty.
[163:27.80]Okay.
[163:31.70]Hold on now.
[163:35.81]Turn it up a little.
[163:43.24]Turn it down a little.
[163:47.59]Oh, goodness.
[163:51.11]Alright, here we go.
[163:52.17]Can you see?
[163:53.51]You guys can't see.
[163:55.68]Can you see?
[163:56.22]I guess you can see now.
[164:01.86]Well, now you can't.
[164:03.01]What the hell's going on here?
[164:07.79]Stop it!
[164:10.76]Why is it doing that?
[164:12.82]Let me try this.
[164:18.57]Don't take my vision away from me.
[164:21.63]This game looks pretty good.
[164:22.65]Hold on.
[164:22.99]Wait, is it in Japanese or something?
[164:24.96]Okay, wait.
[164:26.02]It is English.
[164:30.78]Hold on.
[164:32.91]I gotta add it as a game source, maybe.
[164:40.26]Wait, does it show up?
[164:43.09]There it is.
[164:50.44]Hey, look at that.
[164:52.00]Okay.
[164:54.94]Alright.
[164:55.40]WASD, but I'm using controller.
[164:57.71]Is that bad?
[165:02.05]Shift is whatever this is.
[165:04.30]Jump is X. I think that's three light attacks it wants me to do.
[165:25.97]Okay.
[165:28.08]What is it?
[165:28.38]What is shift?
[165:29.18]Okay.
[165:29.48]It looks like maybe shift is run.
[165:30.96]I'm going to just press it.
[165:31.96]Shift.
[165:36.63]Oh, this is like controlling with a mouse is crazy.
[165:40.06]Space is jump.
[165:44.96]Shift.
[165:48.57]What does it want me to do here?
[165:49.67]Can anybody read that?
[165:52.69]What does it want me to do?
[165:55.66]Try B?
[165:59.60]Shift.
[166:04.77]Shift, run around.
[166:05.75]Shift, run three times around it.
[166:14.42]Oh, okay.
[166:14.92]It wants me to dodge.
[166:17.45]Okay.
[166:17.57]Okay.
[166:28.73]Okay, it wants me to run.
[166:29.71]I think this is probably heavy attack and light attack, maybe?
[166:34.26]No.
[166:35.26]Block on, maybe?
[166:36.22]No.
[166:37.04]Jump.
[166:39.21]Jump three times.
[166:43.27]The first one says something about jumping.
[166:48.02]It's an air dodge?
[166:50.36]Oh!
[166:51.36]Look at you guys reading other languages.
[166:54.05]What's the first one?
[166:55.81]Jump attack, maybe?
[167:01.82]Double jump?
[167:03.83]Ah, look at that.
[167:05.19]Okay.
[167:13.15]Anybody help me out with this one?
[167:22.96]Crouch?
[167:25.47]It's F is crouch, but what is crouch on controller?
[167:30.35]Okay.
[167:31.86]left trigger.
[167:34.49]And then what's the other?
[167:35.09]Okay, the other one's block.
[167:38.61]I'm going to forget all of this.
[167:47.93]I don't know.
[167:48.37]I did one of them.
[167:55.84]One of them's lock on, and the other one is...
[168:02.84]Target lock?
[168:07.33]Oh, okay.
[168:08.77]Got it.
[168:15.10]I'll wait.
[168:20.97]Aim at the enemy and target the target.
[168:24.68]Weak and strong attack.
[168:29.24]I feel like this game feels pretty good, though.
[168:32.50]This game might be pretty damn good.
[168:43.85]Okay.
[168:47.16]Uh... Let's try... Maybe this is probably magic or something?
[169:03.37]Q and left click.
[169:06.02]Q and maybe like a dash attack?
[169:15.45]What does Q do?
[169:16.55]Q. Q and left click.
[169:21.02]Skill 1.
[169:24.24]How do I do that on the controller?
[169:29.19]Q plus E...
[169:35.27]Okay, I don't know how to do that on controller.
[169:39.57]Q and one?
[169:45.88]E, Q and E. D-pad?
[169:57.31]Do right click now.
[169:59.79]Holy shit.
[170:03.36]Okay, Q, E, right click.
[170:07.50]It might be the D-pad.
[170:10.48]Uh... Do something to 100%.
[170:12.40]Gun?
[170:12.62]There's a skill gauge.
[170:26.18]Okay.
[170:32.32]Fill three skill gauges.
[170:34.21]Um...
[170:35.61]What happens if the tutorial dummy is down there?
[170:54.87]Can I reset it?
[170:57.09]Tab.
[171:01.18]Oh god damn it!
[171:08.18]English was right there.
[171:10.55]Okay.
[171:11.21]Whoa!
[171:11.97]Where am I?
[171:15.15]Okay.
[171:16.19]I think I'm... Am I just ready?
[171:18.48]What character do I want to be?
[171:22.12]There's a lot of info on the screen.
[171:26.79]I'm just ready.
[171:29.07]Versus CPU.
[171:30.01]Am I ready?
[171:31.78]Name.
[171:32.66]Map.
[171:35.00]I think I broke it.
[171:36.40]I think I actually broke it.
[171:43.25]Huh.
[171:45.01]Yeah, I broke it.
[171:46.95]It's a fighting game.
[171:49.30]Really?
[171:50.08]I thought it was going to be like a Dark Souls kind of game.
[171:53.92]Uh.
[171:56.20]I can't really do anything right now.
[172:03.17]I'm going to have to kill the process here.
[172:09.30]Yeah, I can't even get out.
[172:11.18]Shit, hold on.
[172:17.45]Well, that seemed like a really interesting one.
[172:21.12]Hold on.
[172:24.12]Oof, did my whole screen...
[172:25.13]I think my computer crashed.
[172:28.49]That was called Duobelum de Marionette.
[172:35.26]That seemed really fun.
[172:37.62]Maybe we'll try it again another time.
[172:43.55]But that seemed like it was a lot of cool things in it.
[172:47.24]Alright, next we are going to play.
[172:49.20]This game is called Undead Tread.
[172:55.13]See how it is.
[173:03.23]It came from the sky.
[173:07.77]From an unknown origin, at least that's what we were told.
[173:11.69]Huge, needle-like structures dropped into every major city across the globe.
[173:18.64]Skip the cutscene!
[173:36.60]Huh?
[173:37.73]Okay, vehicle.
[173:45.86]I'm doing SEGA CD Blue.
[174:04.90]Why can't I do RGB animated lighting on here?
[174:17.20]For shirt color, we're going SEGA CD Blue.
[174:30.72]I'm going to turn this down for me.
[174:33.33]Alright, we're going...
[174:43.78]accelerate W break space steer A and okay well I don't know what that is I'm controller so I'm gonna use I'm gonna use skateboard alright W space A D oh man look at this one earn cash by running over zombies this avoids ammo usage too cash will be used at various locations
[175:12.95]Zombies outlined in white can damage you, dodge, or shoot these enemies.
[175:27.29]Secondary weapon is an explosive.
[175:37.24]This reminds me of some of those old Flash games.
[175:41.81]Complete levels by reaching the gas station at the end of the road.
[175:43.57]You can find a small random amount of fuel at these stations.
[175:47.22]Earn money.
[175:53.91]Sometimes you might need to get stuck.
[175:55.89]They want to respawn.
[175:57.51]Just be still and use the respawn button.
[176:04.68]Okay.
[176:17.20]Drift with control?
[176:18.12]I just drifted and turned it into nighttime.
[176:25.33]What is going on up here?
[176:26.33]Is that my windshield?
[176:29.47]What's this?
[176:30.03]Okay, wait, gas station.
[176:32.89]Permanent rewards.
[176:42.10]Wait, what happened?
[176:45.40]Oh, wait a second.
[176:47.04]Okay, this just got crazy.
[176:56.57]Let's go.
[177:13.57]Let's see how far I get.
[177:16.56]What is that thing?
[177:30.30]Whoa!
[177:30.89]What happened to the road?
[177:35.01]Where's the road?
[177:35.79]What happened to the road?
[177:37.56]What do you mean, return to the road?
[177:42.64]Where's Lakitu?
[177:43.50]Pick my ass up!
[177:55.09]Alright, gas station.
[177:59.09]Blue light.
[177:59.80]Reveals secret in events.
[178:01.18]Turn map into a shop.
[178:02.68]Fuels the car.
[178:06.97]How about, I'll just do blue light.
[178:09.05]Let's go.
[178:13.52]Alright, we got an event coming up.
[178:17.93]Feeling lucky.
[178:19.87]Match any two for a reward.
[178:28.65]Nice.
[178:30.56]Nice.
[178:31.04]Okay.
[178:39.69]I wanted to get new weapons and stuff.
[178:41.05]That's fine.
[178:54.74]I shouldn't have shot him with a rocket.
[178:55.82]That was dumb.
[179:03.28]I have no bullets in any gun.
[179:11.92]All these sports cars, dude.
[179:13.22]Come on.
[179:19.23]Okay.
[179:26.22]R to reload?
[179:27.40]I don't have any ammo.
[179:31.80]Oh, you have to hold it.
[179:32.90]Wait, what?
[179:35.89]Why does it say 50 out of 50 but now it's 0 out of 50?
[179:46.10]I'm stuck.
[179:57.99]You sure about that?
[180:34.74]Alright.
[180:36.23]Next run doesn't have fuel.
[180:37.95]Gives discount.
[180:38.73]How about next run doesn't have any fuel.
[180:40.11]Let's go.
[180:41.93]You're playing like a little brother right now.
[180:47.62]Don't you ever.
[180:51.22]Um.
[180:54.75]What the fuck is happening?
[181:08.38]Are they trying to get in the car?
[181:45.97]Which one of you won't push this cart?
[181:52.82]None of you will survive this!
[182:03.00]Where are they going?
[182:21.70]That was Undead Tread.
[182:33.23]Okay.
[182:35.35]Uh, this one's called Swapmeat.
[182:37.76]M-E-A-T. Swapmeat.
[182:48.95]Swapmeat.
[182:58.92]Okay.
[183:03.43]This one looks interesting.
[183:07.71]Well, this one's wild looking.
[183:10.14]Hold on.
[183:16.81]English.
[183:19.23]Okay.
[183:21.59]I'll do keyboard mouse.
[183:22.47]That's fine.
[183:27.07]You should be able to see it.
[183:28.11]No.
[183:29.51]There we go.
[183:30.17]Alright, here we go.
[183:30.84]Play.
[183:32.38]Private.
[183:33.50]I was going to play private.
[183:38.35]My rat milk brings all the boys.
[183:40.67]What?
[183:42.83]What's claymation?
[183:53.17]What?
[184:03.93]Everybody loved Rangus meats.
[184:05.77]We was all going to live happily ever after.
[184:13.11]Rangus.
[184:22.85]This one's got some polish on it.
[184:25.78]Bigfoot's life is living rent-free in my head since we played it.
[184:47.25]It has made a lasting impression.
[184:49.75]I just think of throwing a huge rock at the deer.
[184:52.48]It's made a total impression.
[184:57.54]That's gonna drop.
[184:58.52]Hold on.
[184:59.20]Let's go half of that.
[185:06.01]30.
[185:08.50]Better.
[185:09.28]Okay.
[185:11.36]Crash site.
[185:15.27]This seems like it could be pretty fun.
[185:16.67]Alright.
[185:17.21]Double jump.
[185:19.46]Oh, look at them little legs moving around.
[185:21.48]I'd love to see that.
[185:26.36]I love the style of this one.
[185:27.74]This one's great.
[185:33.53]Squash some bugs.
[185:39.68]This one's beautiful.
[185:44.04]Okay.
[185:46.30]Destroy nests.
[186:01.19]So I made this in the best way possible.
[186:02.85]This looks like a Wii game.
[186:05.56]I can see that.
[186:11.38]There's a nest behind you.
[186:13.79]Oh, what a tunnel vision weirdo.
[186:27.89]Okay.
[186:28.01]Oh, grab some of them spider legs, push it.
[186:30.70]Spider legs?
[186:33.47]Ooh, whoa!
[186:35.83]Oh my god!
[186:38.69]Spider dash.
[186:43.66]Squishy slide?
[186:45.26]Quickly slide?
[186:46.04]What do the spider legs do?
[186:47.72]Quickly dash in the direction of your movement, okay.
[186:53.83]Very nice.
[186:54.83]There's more.
[186:58.75]Does it come back to life?
[187:02.06]Wait, do they have different rarities?
[187:03.32]No.
[187:08.52]Alright, keep going.
[187:14.55]Yeah, I have other moves too.
[187:16.84]But it's through my... My head's gone.
[187:25.11]Yeah, I need to jump and use the spider legs.
[187:29.02]Nice.
[187:30.06]Okay.
[187:31.86]Fresh meat.
[187:41.28]What is it?
[187:41.64]Rocket swarm.
[187:44.46]Launch a whole bunch of unguided rockets.
[187:48.95]I'm understanding why this game is cool.
[187:52.52]You kind of mix and match your body.
[187:57.20]Interesting.
[188:00.81]Current head.
[188:04.19]Cool.
[188:12.74]I guess you can play this with other people too.
[188:18.43]Secure the meat core.
[188:25.72]Okay, protect.
[188:34.85]Okay, protect the nodes.
[188:35.87]Incoming enemies.
[188:36.77]Here we go.
[188:45.52]Okay.
[188:47.81]I just threw my head.
[188:49.86]Oh shit, it's a turret now.
[188:51.14]I get it.
[188:53.60]Level up.
[188:55.14]It's one of these games.
[188:56.30]Okay, clarity.
[188:59.21]Leg meat durability.
[189:01.13]15% mate.
[189:01.67]Let's do leg meat damage.
[189:15.11]So the turret's actually helpful over here.
[189:25.43]Wait, there's a weird reload here.
[189:27.67]Can you do a perfect reload?
[189:36.50]More damage.
[189:39.30]Wasp torso, now I do slime.
[189:47.15]The ship of Theseus.
[189:58.69]Looks like it could be really fun.
[190:00.07]If there's another level I'll definitely do it.
[190:04.15]This one is fun.
[190:16.79]Are you still the same robot at the end of the mission?
[190:20.03]Uhhh... Do I have the same brain?
[190:29.05]My body is just the vehicle that carries my brain around.
[190:32.07]And my brain deserves a smooth, luxurious ride.
[190:35.27]I think the brain is used.
[190:45.38]Carl Rangus.
[190:55.88]Hunters!
[190:57.44]Hunt him down!
[191:03.20]That's my favorite little squishy.
[191:05.73]Oh, ouchie, them hunters got you, didn't they?
[191:07.81]Well, I'll tell you, you would have seen my warning posters over there.
[191:12.52]That's crazy design.
[191:14.28]Things are weird.
[191:15.96]Them dirty star boogaboos, okay?
[191:18.27]Come talk to me.
[191:25.14]Hunt threat detection system.
[191:27.28]Okay.

[191:31.55]Complete directives.
[191:33.67]Let's do it.
[191:34.79]Ooh, welcome to the easy life now.
[191:40.35]Allows you to legally gather minerals.
[191:43.70]There we go.
[191:46.08]And unlock the weapon terminal.
[191:47.66]Now, weapon is a personal preference, and you do what you want.
[191:50.72]There's no wrong decisions here.
[191:54.84]Let's do rifle.
[192:10.44]Currently equipped.
[192:12.69]Everything has its own tree too.
[192:14.37]Oh boy, this one looks elaborate.

[193:30.60]Last wave.
[193:33.57]Cool.
[193:34.69]New torso.
[193:35.73]Uber shooter?
[193:43.38]Oh, you do have to time the reload.
[193:44.62]Alright.
[193:53.16]More ammo?
[193:54.70]Long range.
[194:01.38]I'll go down there.
[194:01.90]Wait, maybe I can harvest that.
[194:14.85]Ooh, that fire turret's cool.
[194:16.47]Oh, it's a goober turret actually.

[196:00.28]Very cool.
[196:00.78]Alright, I gotta go.
[196:10.41]Anything in the meantime I can get?

[196:58.17]M-E-A-T, swap meat.
[197:16.33]Acid drop.
[197:18.43]Fire.

[197:33.07]Cool.
[197:33.87]That's actually really good.
[197:39.58]The game is very stimulating, I will say.
[197:42.20]But once you kind of get what it's trying to have you do, this is fun.
[197:46.09]This is a good one.
[197:48.93]Wind walk.
[197:58.09]Can fly.
[197:59.95]That lasts a long time.
[198:05.16]Spark plug.

[198:11.83]Swap meat.
[198:14.67]Enter the forbidden cove.
[198:19.44]Do you like licorice?
[198:20.28]Yes or no?
[198:21.26]Nope.
[198:23.16]I would give licorice a 0.0.
[198:25.59]You know what?
[198:25.91]I wouldn't give a 0.0.
[198:30.00]cream of wheat that's right cream of wheat get that good maple get the half sugar don't do full sugar it's unnecessary this is a boss holy shit oh my god that was terrifying

[201:03.00]Killed him.
[201:05.99]Rocket head.
[201:09.81]Secure the meat core.
[201:10.85]Where's the meat core?
[201:13.08]Oh, back there.
[201:16.11]Why does it say you have 300 hours of this on Steam?
[201:20.05]I don't think that's accurate, but whatever.
[201:30.95]I could see how someone could put 300 hours into this.
[201:34.03]Maybe not necessarily demo, but when the game comes out, for sure.
[201:40.57]I think I'm about to leave, but...
[201:43.41]I've left like four times.
[201:50.32]Anybody else swapping?
[201:51.54]They meet.
[201:58.87]Why even ask that?
[201:59.99]You know what I'm saying?
[202:01.13]Why would you ask that question?
[202:02.21]I'm talking just in general.
[202:03.16]Why ask that?
[202:08.94]Why would you ask that?
[202:12.70]Why read it?
[202:13.64]Why write it?
[202:15.34]For every reaction, there's an equal and positive reaction.
[202:18.81]For every reaction, there's an equal and positive...
[202:22.41]I'm gonna die.
[202:30.96]Fuck away from me.
[202:40.96]That ship is coming after me!
[202:41.98]I gotta go!
[202:55.16]Oh, fuck!
[203:06.88]Uh oh!
[203:13.39]I forgot about the final wave!
[203:30.34]I'm good.
[203:31.18]I'm good.
[203:32.73]Homing Eyebrows.
[203:33.67]I'll do the Homing Eyebrows.
[203:53.12]Die!
[203:53.42]Die!
[204:08.55]Where is it?
[204:19.86]What?
[204:20.22]Oh!
[204:22.81]This is terrifying.
[204:38.40]Get off me!
[204:39.28]I'm dead.
[204:42.07]I got one more chance.
[204:46.97]Oh, goodness.
[204:55.11]Fuck!
[204:55.23]Escape in the burger!
[204:57.37]No!
[204:57.93]Please!
[205:01.02]Escape!
[205:02.22]Alright, I did it.
[205:04.72]I killed one of them.
[205:06.31]That was wild.
[205:07.53]That was fun.
[205:08.63]I like it a lot.
[205:11.14]That's a clap for sure.
[205:18.53]Good stuff.
[205:25.04]I thought that said something else.
[205:27.07]I was like, wait, what?
[205:29.62]Barbecue?
[205:31.22]Excuse me?
[205:31.86]What the fuck are you talking about?
[205:48.06]entering that place.
[205:50.68]It's very good.
[205:53.19]I think it's going to be worth playing when it comes out for sure.
[205:55.39]There's swap meat.
[205:57.83]We are going to move on to the next one.
[206:01.70]How many more do I got?
[206:03.82]I'll do like one or two more.
[206:06.14]Maybe do one more.
[206:12.31]I only plan on being live for about three or four hours, so let's do it.
[206:18.32]I got... How about Wanted 3D, Dead or Alive?
[206:27.81]This one looks like I'm going to love it.
[206:30.03]It's kind of a boomer shooter, but Wild West.
[206:44.49]Try it.
[206:49.00]The game would be good.
[207:00.15]Might be a little loud.
[207:01.25]Let's turn it down.
[207:03.14]Okay, whoops.
[207:04.10]Once upon a time in the...
[207:05.42]Wait, back up.
[207:08.76]Do options.
[207:12.91]Um... Controls.
[207:18.81]mo okay this is interesting uh action action mouse one uh gun wheel I'll start whatever normal difficulty moderate resistance let's go
[207:48.78]A long time ago, I was part of a band of outlaws, and we managed to steal a great bounty of gold.
[207:58.32]There was our leader, King Ace, great at gambling and great at swindling.
[208:05.22]Billy the Quick, one of the fastest gunslingers out there.
[208:11.26]One-Eye Sam, a beast of a man and a real Deadeye.
[208:18.01]Finally, me.
[208:20.27]They thought I hadn't earned a true nickname yet, so they called me the Nameless Rider.
[208:29.10]Cause they didn't want to share with a rookie like me.
[208:34.99]They turned on me and handed me over to the lawmen.
[208:40.42]I love the little grass BNGs.
[208:42.68]And during my time, I've only heard whispers about where my former amigos have been.
[208:50.02]Guess it's the only lead I have for now.
[208:54.34]And before I end their miserable lives, I will strike fear in their hearts as the Nameless Rider.
[209:06.97]Okay.
[209:08.93]All mines.
[209:10.47]F1 to learn the basics.
[209:14.70]Okay.
[209:15.32]Fist.
[209:16.08]Guns.
[209:17.32]Health.
[209:17.88]Map.
[209:19.00]Okay.
[209:22.21]Shoot.
[209:22.93]Of course.
[209:23.49]Jump.
[209:23.99]Reload.
[209:24.49]Yep.
[209:24.81]Of course.
[209:26.65]Gun wheel.
[209:27.21]Of course.
[209:27.99]WSD.
[209:28.43]Yep.
[209:28.83]Duck.
[209:29.72]Run.
[209:30.34]Shift.
[209:31.08]Okay.
[209:31.68]Pretty self-explanatory.
[209:34.17]I need to drop the sensitivity if I can.
[209:38.59]There you go.
[209:48.21]Mouse options.
[209:48.93]Here we go.
[209:51.92]Let's do 1.2.
[209:53.44]Should be good.
[209:58.47]That's better.
[209:58.93]Alright, let's go.
[210:04.09]I love the...
[210:05.65]The human sprites.
[210:08.82]Something also that you'll see in a lot of the SEGA CD games that we play later.
[210:13.68]I love the human sprites.
[210:14.94]They're so fun.
[210:17.37]Crouch.
[210:22.28]Fast secondary fire.
[210:30.43]Weird.
[210:30.89]Okay.
[210:31.37]Is it...
[210:36.69]He's here!
[211:02.70]50 bullets, holy shit.
[211:11.06]Where's my health down?
[211:11.78]Okay, lower left.
[211:18.39]Oops.
[211:20.69]Uh-oh.
[211:36.19]I can't believe the game's in 3D.
[211:37.87]I know, dude.
[211:38.51]We're in another dimension.
[211:44.61]Will there ever actually be a 4D or a 5D game?
[211:48.00]What would a 4D game be?
[211:48.98]What is the fourth dimension?
[211:51.30]Well, Bubsy already did it, but marketing's not accurate.
[211:57.79]Smell-O-Vision?
[211:58.79]Well, that's not 4D.
[212:00.91]Time.
[212:03.77]Didn't Animal Crossing already do that?
[212:08.04]Animal Crossing is a 4D game.
[212:16.52]What is going on?
[212:18.83]What the fuck, lady?
[212:29.84]That was not an innocent.
[212:31.41]That's what I thought was going on until she threw a stick of dynamite at me.
[212:37.40]Time to hit the detonator and blast my way through.
[212:47.69]Shit.
[212:53.85]Where's the detonator?
[212:58.89]Over here?
[213:19.47]Is that guy walking around punching?
[213:37.25]Okay, now I'm...
[213:38.33]I didn't get a...
[213:39.01]I took a dynamite throw in my face a lot like I did last time.
[213:45.71]It does the doom wipe?
[213:46.97]Yeah.
[213:48.11]Okay, I need a detonator.
[213:49.68]Just snipe him from up here.
[214:01.42]Screw it.
[214:18.63]Watch out, guy coming.
[214:20.93]I don't know if he can get me from right there.
[214:28.14]Alright, watch out for the guy with the fists.
[214:29.72]Where is he?
[214:41.68]Holy shit, he's still alive.
[214:47.46]Damn, dude.
[214:54.71]OK, that name is definitely in here.
[215:09.53]Free shit.
[215:11.67]What a fantastic game that really was.
[215:13.37]That's probably one of the best first person shooters of all time.
[215:26.53]I would love a resurgence.
[215:34.91]The Wild West is an interesting genre because it feels like a lot of developers, first person, didn't really get explored that much.
[215:43.20]What's that game called?
[215:44.73]Call of Juarez, right?
[215:47.27]That's one of the only FPS...
[215:49.99]That I can really think of that was a genuine mainstream video game.
[215:54.42]The Red Dead games were third person.
[215:57.38]I think you could, could you do third person?
[215:58.94]Maybe with like mods or something.
[216:00.02]Maybe, where's the detonator?
[216:01.77]Did I get it already?
[216:06.07]Redneck Rampage does not count.
[216:08.65]I'm sorry, it doesn't.
[216:13.58]Gun was good.
[216:16.72]But I'm talking like this.
[216:17.66]Arcade shooter with a great multiplayer.
[216:27.64]Team deathmatch multiplayer.
[216:31.50]Or other kinds of multiplayer too.
[216:37.97]Nowadays, and I'm going to look, okay, yeah, I'm 40 and this is bad.
[216:41.67]You all agree with this.
[216:42.74]I know a lot of you do.
[216:44.55]I would much prefer, and tell me there's a game like this because I don't know if there is.
[216:49.69]I have six shots in this, and they have to be very accurate.
[216:54.42]It's not like, slide, jump, slide, jump.
[217:01.39]Or it's not just unload like 500 volts.
[217:16.14]no I'm not going to play Counter-Strike because there's a okay my perfect game is pause this for a second my perfect game is a first-person shooter with a skill ceiling I'm going to describe Team Fortress but whatever I want another Team Fortress type game the skill ceiling in Counter-Strike makes me not want to play it right there is there's a skyscraper level of skill ceiling in these games where if you're really good you'll destroy everybody
[217:45.23]And it's like, I can't even play in a game with a lobby because my level is like the first floor in the elevator.
[217:53.49]I want a game where the first floor in the elevator can operate in the same lobby as the guy in the executive suite at the 50th floor.
[218:04.55]And how that works in a game like Team Fortress is there's so many weird variables that even the guy jumping around, quickscoping everybody, is going to get hit by a stray Demoman crit bomb.
[218:15.99]And it's going to shut his streak down.
[218:19.40]There'll be a heavy on the cart that you just cannot stop.
[218:21.60]Maybe you can.
[218:24.08]But there's a lot of equalizers in some of these games.
[218:30.40]I like games with a skill ceiling that's high, but not so high that I just will never see it.
[218:45.69]And I'm not, okay, I'm not talking about the blue shell from Mario Kart, because I don't like that.
[218:50.90]Right, okay, if I just looked down this hallway, and there was ten people down this hallway, and I went, oh!
[218:57.12]And then the bullet, it goes into first person cam and it homing missiles into everybody in that hallway.
[219:02.52]By the way, they could be a hundred yards away.
[219:05.63]I don't want to do that.
[219:06.19]I don't want to go.
[219:07.17]Oh, look, I found the, the, the super shotgun.
[219:10.27]Cool.
[219:11.75]I, are there people down there?
[219:13.05]I think there's probably five that their spawn is a hundred yards away.
[219:17.96]The kill feed is crazy.
[219:20.48]No, I don't want that.
[219:27.39]I want the skill ceiling to be high enough, but low enough.
[219:32.16]It needs to be a goalie lock scenario.
[219:38.69]Dynamite.
[219:41.58]I didn't throw that very far.
[219:49.57]Too many explosions and you've got yourself a spam dogshit game.
[219:53.83]Too many ultimates and you have yourself a spammy dogshit game.
[219:58.41]Too little explosions and you have yourself a...
[220:02.40]It's impossible to do anything because there's one guy that's sitting in the window that's going to kill every single person.
[220:06.16]He's unbelievable at the game and they'll never lose.
[220:08.90]There's an amount of...
[220:09.66]There's a Goldilocks level of explosions that has to be in the game.
[220:13.77]Or...
[220:14.75]Deterrence.
[220:15.49]Area deterrence.
[220:18.21]Do you not like Overwatch?
[220:22.00]I don't really like Overwatch.
[220:25.21]I liked Overwatch when it was 2016.
[220:29.28]But even then...
[220:30.74]The year or two that I liked playing Overwatch...
[220:34.99]It kind of was just like...
[220:35.89]Okay, here we come.
[220:36.29]We're going to turn the corner.
[220:38.38]And...
[220:39.50]Oh, rain from above, I am here to stop you.
[220:46.90]Oh, intriguing, intriguing, inquisition.
[220:51.51]I don't know, whatever the fuck they all say.
[220:54.09]You just hear, it's like voice lines spam and like the screen blows up into like 15,000 different colors.
[221:12.83]Stewie.
[221:16.05]I have no idea what you just said.
[221:17.43]Okay, what I said was there's always a push scenario.
[221:21.00]Where a bunch of ultimates just happen at the same time.
[221:24.02]I don't want ultimates in this perfect game I'm talking about.
[221:27.54]There are no ultimates.
[221:35.99]I think everybody caved to the pressure of having to put an ultimate in every fucking video game.
[221:39.96]Since like 2017.
[221:54.42]It's the same fundamental issue with all multiplayer games.
[222:03.02]And then matchmaking, right?
[222:04.22]Then, okay, well, what about matchmaking?
[222:05.70]Now you got matchmaking.
[222:08.63]So now, we're all the same potential skill level, but some matchmaking is worse than others.
[222:19.47]But I don't know, I kind of don't really like matchmaking.
[222:22.35]Okay.
[222:23.21]I like the fact that there's like a shpee walking around.
[222:25.88]Do you know what I'm saying?
[222:27.98]I like how there's a guy just kind of over there, just doing nothing.
[222:31.29]And he's like learning the fucking controls.
[222:33.05]He probably has a mouse that he just plugged in for the first time ever.
[222:36.68]And he doesn't even know how to, his sensitivity is probably too high.
[222:43.43]Skill based matchmaking is dog shit and ruined everything.
[222:57.91]Yeah, I kind of want to like be I just would rather just kind of join a server.
[223:04.91]Or just get thrown into a like a big pool.
[223:09.52]holy fuck there's monsters depends on the game and the player count yeah there's no I look I don't know half of that world how that works I don't really play a whole lot of multiplayer games I could tell you that I wish every game would just be Team Fortress 2.
[223:35.62]But that's like saying, you know, ever since Super Mario 3, they just should have never made another platformer ever again.
[223:42.55]That's dumb.
[223:43.55]That's a dumb thing to say.
[223:47.53]What's that?
[223:58.55]It's kind of frustrating in a way, too, because...
[224:01.79]Hold on.
[224:04.63]I remember...
[224:06.48]I'm gonna make a comment here because we talked about like, oh, since Team Fortress 2.
[224:10.69]It's been like 20 years.
[224:12.41]And I thought when I played TF2, it's like, oh my god, dude, here it comes.
[224:14.84]Here comes like, we're gonna get so much crazy fucking multiplayer games.
[224:18.59]It's gonna be so fun.
[224:20.63]I'll give you a story about Diablo 3.
[224:24.09]Dude, when Diablo II was out, I remember me and my brother talking about it.
[224:28.37]We would sit around and we'd go, man, technology's getting so much better.
[224:33.10]Can you imagine?
[224:34.48]It's how unbelievable these games are going to be when we're older.
[224:39.75]Imagine Diablo 3, dude.
[224:41.39]Are you serious?
[224:42.09]They have like Pentium 4 processors now?
[224:46.46]That's crazy.
[224:47.26]It's going to be so awesome.
[224:49.44]I remember the Game Informer Diablo 3 reveal.
[224:53.70]And I remember, I remember I was shitting in college.
[224:56.93]I'll never forget this.
[224:58.49]I was reading the game Informer while I was taking a shit.
[225:01.98]And I was flipping through it and I just kept going, this is, this is Diablo.
[225:06.51]It's a new Diablo game and it's, it's new and it's got, look at the graphics and look at this environment.
[225:12.18]You can, you can react to the environments and there's going to be items.
[225:16.91]And dude, since me and my brother talked about Diablo II that way, and how excited we were about the future of video games, I can tell you, there ain't been nothing that's come out I was so excited about it.
[225:30.21]Like dude, we're going back to D2 is the last time where it was like, holy fucking shit, Diablo II!
[225:42.04]I've been waiting for a replacement to that game for 20 fucking years.
[225:56.51]The last good game was Pong.
[226:01.48]And I feel like the industry...
[226:03.58]The indie stuff is where it's at nowadays, right?
[226:07.22]I feel like that's kind of the way it is.
[226:12.95]Guys, I think the indie developers are the ones that are willing to take the risks and are willing to try new things and make things as, like, interesting and great.
[226:20.32]We're all... Dude, we...
[226:26.20]How much time do you have?
[226:36.87]I got about 20 seconds.
[226:37.73]Alright, because that's how long it's going to take me to be quiet.
[226:44.18]It just feels weird to think back when I was 15, 16.
[226:48.76]And to think of what the trajectory of the industry was going to do.
[226:51.77]And what a lot of the industry actually did.
[226:56.50]That guy got crushed.
[227:05.81]Being, you know, pie in the sky, 16 year old going, this is going to be incredible.
[227:12.02]And I've just, I feel like I've been stuck in Diablo II limbo since I was 16.
[227:16.41]Oh shit, what is that guy?
[227:29.75]Why did I think I could hit shift and do a dash?
[227:33.71]Fuck.
[227:36.62]I have that other game still in my brain for some reason.
[227:38.76]I hit shift to do a dash across that.
[227:44.13]This one was actually really fun.
[227:45.03]I liked it a lot.
[227:48.17]I may have crashed the game too.
[227:51.24]I don't think the developer expected anybody to fall in here.
[227:56.71]Don't you like Elden Ring?
[227:58.11]Yes.
[227:58.71]And look, I'm not trying to say that everything that comes along is bad.
[228:02.46]All new games aren't good and only the indie ones or the ones from 20 years ago are good.
[228:10.27]You can't even hear me.
[228:14.77]Hold on.
[228:16.63]We're going to have to abort this one.
[228:21.20]Okay.
[228:22.12]I got to quit this one.
[228:27.29]oh here we go okay but yeah I think that the game industry went down a road where everything has had to be a a lot of the triple a stuff let's put it that way
[228:52.33]Because I'll tell you, if they had just made, and maybe this is a shit take for some of you, but I'm just giving you my experience.
[228:59.62]If Diablo 3 was just a continuation of Diablo II with updated graphics and a shitload more uniques and a little bit, like the story kind of maybe could keep going or do something else.
[229:14.45]I feel like people just want to reinvent franchises every fucking 10 minutes.
[229:18.87]I just wanted more of Diablo II.
[229:20.60]Just give me more Diablo II.
[229:21.44]That's all I wanted.
[229:29.17]We should have stayed at the iPhone 6.
[229:33.80]Alright, this next one is called Re-Animal.
[229:37.62]Re-Animal.
[229:41.71]That's a controller game.
[229:51.48]You're complaining about them making the same thing over and over again, but not... Oh, I want to respond to this because I'm seeing how much of an idiot I am.
[229:57.89]Complain about them making the same thing over and over again, but also want the same thing?
[230:02.08]No, I think it's more like... Companies started to try to innovate on things that nobody cared about.
[230:10.94]Like, ways to make as much money as possible.
[230:14.32]Right?
[230:14.56]Like, the innovation in making a game better became an innovation on how to increase the amount of income that the game was making.
[230:24.07]That's what I mean.
[230:28.51]Games had to start to become revenue drivers rather than just like pieces of media.
[230:36.44]That's where the innovation went.
[230:38.94]For the last, I'd say, probably 15 years.
[230:45.60]And again, this is not the case with everybody.
[230:49.20]We got the whole Dark Souls series and all the things into Elden Ring and Night Rain.
[230:54.45]All that happened in the last 15 years.
[230:58.21]There's still amazing innovation.
[231:05.26]But I would just like to see more.
[231:09.87]I don't know.
[231:11.51]Just pass the fucking bong already, man.
[231:16.34]Okay, thank you for playing.
[231:18.89]We would love to have you help improving the game by contributing your using data.
[231:23.51]Does it only include...
[231:25.73]I decline every time.
[231:26.63]I'm sorry.
[231:27.39]I don't care what it says.
[231:40.25]Crossplay on crossplay.
[231:49.69]Microtransactions and games cut in half.
[231:51.59]Another half sold as DLC.
[231:53.31]Yeah, and I know I can sit here and say that.
[231:56.36]And, you know, get the good boy points.
[231:58.54]Like, everyone's going to give me good points for that.
[232:00.62]Oh, look what he said!
[232:01.52]Oh, how brave of him!
[232:02.92]No, right?
[232:05.87]I'm not trying to say that.
[232:07.15]I'm not trying to get, like, extra points.
[232:14.42]Oh, don't keep that.
[232:23.37]This is co-op.
[232:33.17]Dude, you won the internet.
[232:34.29]Yeah, I'm just...
[232:36.99]I'm just trying to fucking exist.
[232:38.31]I'm just trying to live, man.
[232:39.45]You know what I mean?
[232:50.69]Hit the bong, dude.
[232:56.40]Here's your Twitch gold, sir.
[232:57.88]No, I don't want your fucking Twitch gold.
[233:00.40]I don't want any upvotes.
[233:04.01]Downvote this stream.
[233:16.25]I think this is by the Little Nightmares people.
[233:19.54]Is that correct?
[233:33.77]I also think that having a sole lead game designer with a vision is better than a thousand people trying to change everything that happens with the game from start to finish.
[233:45.97]I think you have two or three people that are the fucking people leading the project and not like a thousand people needing to change everything and tell you everything about it.
[233:52.08]Oh, we need to add this.
[233:52.76]We have to put this in that game has to be like this.
[233:54.16]It has to be like that.
[233:54.74]And we have to be the profit margin has to be like this.
[233:56.56]You have to go through marketing, put it through marketing five times before you put it, send it back to the lead designer.
[234:00.01]Then the lead designer has 10 people on it.
[234:04.89]I have to get that approved by the co-secondary lead designer.
[234:09.02]Who then has to get that approved by the C-suite.
[234:11.98]Then that goes to the marketing people.
[234:13.18]And then it comes back to me.
[234:14.88]And it's been telephoned so many times that it's not the game that I wanted to make.
[234:24.69]This is the guy who spearheaded the candle.
[234:26.33]Listen to this guy.
[234:28.35]I'm reading that from chat.
[234:29.74]I'm not saying that to be like an ego weirdo.
[234:32.08]That was a funny thing somebody said.
[234:35.99]Where do I go?
[234:44.76]Weird.
[234:56.92]I'm very much a let the wild guy with the whiteboard cook for a little while and then we just make it.
[235:06.08]And that could be a half dozen people, but that's who's doing it.
[235:17.59]Are you saying this because you're the whiteboard guy?
[235:21.88]Look.
[235:22.96]All I'm saying.
[235:26.26]Pay attention to this shit!
[235:28.19]Oh my god.
[235:33.87]How do I get him out of the boat?
[235:39.95]dodging he's dodging I will not have you call me dodgy Dave I'm not going to take advice from a junior minister an absurd proposition I watch that video like once every few months
[236:20.45]Boom.
[236:22.99]Oh shit, I'm controlling the game again.
[237:00.02]I'm just I'm engrossed right now.
[237:03.65]I that's why I'm not talking.
[237:26.17]Was the candle to coming out?
[237:29.53]The Candle 2 is going to be Candle 1 DLC.
[237:33.54]It's the Candle 2.
[237:41.66]I just laughed at my own joke.
[237:45.05]Yeah, I did.
[237:45.91]I'm sorry, everybody.
[237:48.98]I clapped at that one.
[237:59.35]Have you no shame.
[238:03.38]Hold on, this is cool.
[238:08.39]Don't you think it'd be funny if this happened?
[238:17.71]The fuck is that?
[238:29.69]Well, I didn't laugh at my own joke.
[238:31.46]This is what happens.
[238:32.16]I visualize a scenario in my head and I laugh at it.
[238:37.36]I don't know if anybody else does that too.
[238:39.83]Where you like make up an entire scene in your head that you watch.
[238:45.08]You see it play out in color.
[238:47.48]And it's just like, oh, that was funny.
[238:52.07]Like I can just literally right now have the Muppets just kind of just dancing in front of me right now.
[238:57.03]No, I'm not hallucinating.
[238:59.12]That sounded like a hallucination, but it's not.
[239:01.55]The Muppets are...
[239:02.55]There's Fozzie.
[239:03.09]He literally is going, Hey!
[239:04.29]And he's waving at me.
[239:06.18]Not in real life.
[239:06.96]Upstairs.
[239:10.49]Stop taking Tylenol.
[239:12.19]Oh, shut up.
[239:18.62]Okay, dude.
[239:19.85]Alright.
[239:28.57]It's called visualization.
[239:30.27]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[239:48.76]I can't visualize my thoughts.
[239:50.04]I can't relate.
[239:53.09]Something that I think we talked about before is the notion that there are actually a lot of people that can't.
[240:01.70]People think and see and hear in different ways that we're learning about now.
[240:09.58]And by now I mean like in the last 50 years.
[240:14.08]That's a dumb thing to say that I said now.
[240:26.13]It is a jump.
[240:37.44]Like for instance, when I say the word apple.
[240:40.19]Can you see an apple?
[240:42.45]Like up in a different dimension in your head.
[240:45.93]Because right now I have literally I have my monitor.
[240:48.11]I've got the chat over here on the left.
[240:49.30]I've got controller in my hand, but I also can see.
[240:54.43]And I can make that apple whatever I want.
[240:56.79]I can make it a cartoon apple.
[240:59.56]Bozzie Bear just came over, grabbed it, took a big bite out of it in claymation style.
[241:05.31]A lot of people cannot do that.
[241:07.33]And I did not know that until like the last five years or so.
[241:10.32]We've talked about this once or twice before.
[241:13.57]And some people can do that, but they can only do it in a very specific style or way.
[241:18.77]And you say, hey, can you see an apple in your head?
[241:21.86]Yeah, but it's not a 3D plane.
[241:23.88]Or it's only a cartoon.
[241:25.52]I can't visualize an actual, real apple.
[241:28.33]I can visualize part of an apple.
[241:34.22]And that's very interesting.
[241:36.50]Some people might even think in words.
[241:38.30]Like, you see the word apple.
[241:39.78]You don't actually see an apple.
[241:47.89]I think in black and white.
[241:48.95]That's another thing too.
[241:49.61]Some people probably don't even potentially think in color.
[241:54.40]And then I think more deeply on this and it's like, I don't speak any other languages.
[242:01.33]And that's really interesting to me too.
[242:05.15]Because thinking in a different language or not translating anything, being able to think in a different language is something I cannot even comprehend.
[242:22.35]What are you yapping about?
[242:23.61]We're just talking.
[242:27.21]This is a beautiful game though.
[242:37.65]What do babies think about?
[242:40.83]Yeah, do babies think?
[242:43.47]I don't think so.
[242:46.38]Oh fuck, we're going to get blown away.
[242:57.58]I think we... Uh-oh.
[242:58.93]This is bad.
[243:01.81]Well, I need to know that now!
[243:21.51]Well, no.
[243:21.79]Babies can talk.
[243:24.24]And babies can think.
[243:24.96]And babies have their own language that gets translated.
[243:28.63]Remember in a series of unfortunate events, the baby goes like, and it says, shut up, stupid.
[243:38.75]So they can.
[243:55.20]Oh, shit.
[243:58.86]I feel like this would be a really cool co-op experience judging by the other games that they have.
[244:27.54]Jesus.
[244:30.04]I'm not controlling both.
[244:32.33]One is following the other.
[244:34.77]I'm this guy here.
[244:44.28]Can I launch you up?
[244:54.27]I'm picturing a baby breakdancing right now.
[244:58.49]Nice.
[245:10.29]Now I am too.
[245:12.37]Isn't that crazy?
[245:14.64]Telepathy exists already.
[245:21.50]Don't believe me?
[245:26.84]A pineapple upside-down cake floating in the air in front of Zeus, god of the gods.
[245:34.35]See, right now, a shitload of you just got that.
[245:38.82]You just saw it.
[245:39.48]You literally just saw that floating in front of Zeus.
[245:44.11]I just transported an image into your head through language and through communication.
[245:55.58]I knew you would.
[246:01.03]You should leave while you still can.
[246:16.28]He's flexing his god powers.
[246:21.10]Bro, that's called listening.
[246:30.02]But wait, but what is listening?
[246:33.86]Batman, what is listening?
[246:37.19]Isn't listening just a little thing that I put up there, Batman?
[247:01.29]There's got to be... Somebody's got to have a Joker monolog about that.
[247:10.57]See, Batman?
[247:13.25]When I talked about exploding the boat, you thought that.
[247:18.82]You saw it, didn't you?
[247:22.00]I think that makes you a little bit evil yourself, doesn't it, Batman?
[247:34.86]No, no, Joker, no way.
[247:36.28]I'm not evil.
[247:37.91]Well, when I said that, you visualized it, didn't you?
[247:42.32]No, no.
[247:45.02]I guess one could say that.
[247:47.51]I'm trying to do mouth sounds, but you can't hear it.
[247:59.82]And then, yeah, Batman sitting across the table and he's like, oh, okay, Joker, what I want you to do is I want you to visualize something for me.
[248:06.54]Visualize the bottom of a fucking shoe.
[248:11.93]Visualize it's a size 12.
[248:14.73]It's a boot and it's part of a latex suit.
[248:17.56]And I want you to visualize that right in your face, kicking you in the fucking teeth.
[248:22.28]Do you see that, Joker?
[248:25.03]Well, yeah, and then he kicks him in the face.
[248:28.39]Hard, right in his teeth.
[248:34.44]And then the Joker starts clapping, laughing.
[248:39.65]What?
[248:59.42]Can I jump into the hole?
[249:01.61]Hole?
[249:06.39]I think I can jump in the hole.
[249:19.46]Can you direct the next movie?
[249:26.71]Give me the whiteboard.
[249:29.31]Hey, you get me a whiteboard?
[249:31.77]A handle of Jack Daniels.
[249:34.53]Three ham and cheese sandwiches.
[249:39.26]And one of those Dunkin Donuts Box of Joes.
[249:44.61]And I get you the new Batman movie in fucking three days.
[249:46.77]I don't think I can do that.
[249:53.58]Was I just bad?
[249:54.58]Or do I have to do something else?
[249:58.83]I feel like I can make the jump.
[250:12.88]I definitely can make you jump.
[250:23.81]You just get drunk and just puke and sit on the cooler.
[250:28.42]Can I make this jump?
[250:30.32]Okay, that is not what you do.
[250:32.00]So let me actually figure this out.
[250:35.83]I'm not a performance artist anymore.
[250:39.15]I know.
[250:41.09]Don't you know that 90% of everything we say that I say in the stream is me fucking around?
[250:48.62]Don't you get it?
[250:52.16]Come on, when?
[250:54.18]You thought I was going to forget that part.
[251:05.24]That must have turned something else on.
[251:19.40]Oh, okay.
[251:34.95]Right here.
[251:35.19]Now we do this.
[251:35.81]Excellent.
[251:46.16]Okay.
[251:46.28]Um... Hmm.
[251:48.27]Oh, so you can do it.
[252:06.64]Can you make this?
[252:10.59]Oh, I can take this down.
[252:15.46]Visualizing you gassy.
[252:18.26]Well, now you're actually getting banned.
[252:21.46]Ban that person.
[252:22.10]And I mean for real.
[252:35.23]Shut that person down now.
[252:37.76]Now.
[252:42.98]I just hit the eject button underneath your seat.
[252:50.17]You don't need to go home, but you can't stay here.
[252:54.96]That's a great comment on everything.
[253:05.63]Why would you put that on your head?
[253:33.15]That's disgusting.
[253:40.41]Okay, let's keep going.
[253:53.61]I love the atmosphere of this game.
[253:55.09]It's really cool.
[254:01.05]It's a very unique style.
[254:02.66]I like it.
[254:05.70]And it's an indie game.
[254:06.44]It's not a AAA game, so I like it.
[254:10.30]Right?
[254:10.62]Let me be clear on that too.
[254:12.05]I like a lot of AAA games.
[254:15.19]This is not like, well, I'm not going to play a AAA game ever again.
[254:18.59]There's a lot of AAA games that are still very good, like we said.
[254:31.05]Name one.
[254:32.51]I mean, Elden Ring is a AAA game, guys.
[254:35.20]That's one of my favorite games ever made.
[254:37.60]Bloodborne.
[254:39.36]One of my favorite games of all time.
[254:42.03]I'd be full of shit if I told you otherwise.
[254:45.85]That's an old game?
[254:46.95]Elden Ring is considered an old game now?
[254:51.50]What are you talking about?
[254:54.12]Old, old, old.
[254:55.52]This is like two years ago.
[255:06.92]What's another AAA game that's come out in the last three years that I actually really, really loved?
[255:11.93]I really enjoyed it.
[255:13.35]Let me think.
[255:14.83]Oh, I know.
[255:15.37]All the Resident Evil games.
[255:20.66]Resident Evil 8, I enjoyed it.
[255:22.12]I thought it was good.
[255:23.36]The Resident Evil 4 remake was spectacular.
[255:26.84]I think Capcom's been doing some pretty great bangers recently.
[255:29.89]I think the Resident Evil remakes have been great.
[255:35.93]Jesus.
[255:40.39]You literally said, fuck Capcom playing Resident Evil 8.
[255:43.03]Yeah, and then I came around to how good... Look.
[255:45.97]You get in the raw opinion when I play a game.
[255:48.93]If I bump my head on a chandelier in a game, I'm going to tell you it's the worst game of all time.
[255:53.96]Don't listen to a word I say about a game until I complete it.
[256:03.75]I will get a mis-input and I'll tell you just don't buy it.
[256:06.35]The game's terrible.
[256:07.96]Because, like, I accidentally walked off a ledge that I didn't know was there.
[256:11.95]And I blame everybody else but myself.
[256:14.11]Wait till the final verdict, okay?
[256:19.62]Although, for real though, it was like 75 FOV and you couldn't change it.
[256:25.17]What do you want me to do?
[256:27.51]Not scream into my webcam?
[256:29.70]Okay.
[256:46.94]Ooh, cool.
[256:54.39]I've been better about that, though.
[256:55.89]As I've gotten a little older, I don't think I have very many... Fuck.
[257:00.44]I'm not going to say the word.
[257:01.56]Because I know people are going to be like, look, he said it again.
[257:06.09]Can you hide in the bushes?
[257:18.07]I'm going to play Katamari on day one.
[257:19.56]I don't know day one, but I definitely will.
[257:27.03]Don't watch your Resident Evil streams until the end.
[257:31.63]You're free to watch or not watch whatever you want.
[257:39.76]I don't control your internet router.
[257:52.06]Can I pull it?
[258:01.27]Weird Feels like it should be going down
[258:19.48]There's no wheel.
[258:22.61]What the fu- Alright, let's move it.
[258:41.97]Something else is missing.
[258:46.92]Okay, we need another wheel.
[258:48.22]Let's find the wheel.
[258:52.96]Do you need yellow paint?
[258:54.12]No, I don't need yellow paint.
[258:58.71]I've completed far...
[259:01.33]There's a lot of complicated games that don't have maps that I've completed on stream without a problem.
[259:07.84]Are you projecting?
[259:18.26]Okay, where's this other wheel?
[259:23.10]Does the game need more red circles?
[259:25.91]I haven't...
[259:26.53]I have not had an issue yet.
[259:28.09]Why are we pretending?
[259:28.81]Why are you saying I have an issue with this?
[259:31.23]I did one second.
[259:33.86]And I'm looking...
[259:34.32]I'm talk...
[259:34.70]I'm reading a chat.
[259:41.07]Mods start mass timing out people by the thousands.
[259:47.00]I just want to see a sea of... Oh god.
[259:58.78]Whoa, that's gross.
[260:04.64]Can we climb through that?
[260:21.00]Flush the toilets at the same time.
[260:24.53]Is that a wheel?
[260:27.73]Here, come here.
[260:28.13]Flush this.
[260:40.76]Can't do anything here.
[260:48.29]Feel like I have to do something with the toilet.
[260:51.86]Oh, yep.
[260:55.98]Let's plunge this.
[261:07.72]What's the use item button?
[261:25.28]Maybe I don't plunge this.
[261:34.00]Because when I press B, he puts it down.
[261:47.28]Hmm.
[261:47.42]Oh, okay.
[261:48.20]Well.
[261:53.32]Uh-huh.
[261:54.08]Can I plunge this?
[261:57.88]OK, it's it is actually why the plunge.
[262:10.96]That's gross.
[262:12.10]What was in there?
[262:16.19]What was the point of that?
[262:19.71]Guess I'll plunge the rest of them.
[262:31.00]This looks like my dad.
[262:35.31]What are you on about?
[262:47.49]Is she gonna help?
[263:04.84]Why is she not helping?
[263:14.35]I want to do all the...
[263:15.19]I want to plunge all the toilets.
[263:23.20]Wait, did I get a key?
[263:24.55]Let me see if a key came out.
[263:25.65]Was I looking at chat and didn't see it?
[263:29.89]Did a key actually come out?
[263:30.84]I literally was looking over at chat.
[263:39.26]Oh, fuck.
[263:39.92]I was looking over at chat.
[263:41.19]I didn't even look.
[263:42.83]Whenever that appeared.
[263:45.29]Maybe we should bring the plunger with us.
[263:51.24]Nice blame chat.
[263:52.08]How convenient.
[263:57.79]No, not yellow paint.
[263:58.97]I don't need yellow paint.
[264:05.78]Okay, can I open one of these other doors or something?
[264:13.99]That is the yellow paint.
[264:15.07]Yeah, you guys are my yellow paint.
[264:25.98]You guys are yellow paint with a bunch of swear words attached.
[264:29.83]Instead of, hey, you need to go up the ladder, it's, hey, stupid, you need to go up the fucking ladder.
[264:33.99]I can't believe he's this dumb.
[264:36.53]You understand?
[264:36.91]You add a lot of adjectives when you could just say the yellow... You just tell me to go up the ladder.
[264:41.40]You don't need all the adjectives.
[264:50.58]What is that?
[264:58.77]Brick.
[265:07.22]Two bricks.
[265:07.92]Why don't you pick one up too?
[265:19.97]Anything over here?
[265:20.73]I just want to say a few years ago, you said you would rather show your asshole on stream than play Disney Infinity 3.0.
[265:36.25]And you've yet to honor either of those.
[265:44.18]I tried to play Disney Infinity 3.0 and it wouldn't work.
[265:48.53]That thing's going to move.
[266:00.83]Got another wheel.
[266:03.33]Alright, let's go.
[266:12.11]Oh, that's the slimy people.
[266:17.53]What wait?
[266:26.77]Wrong quick open the door.
[266:35.02]Alright, get on.
[266:39.30]Correct.
[266:55.04]I still have this thing on my head.
[267:36.17]Made it.
[267:41.98]You're going to finish Thrillville off the rails.
[267:45.77]No, but we're going to play.
[267:53.50]Some fun stuff.
[267:58.70]Do you like the game idea?
[267:59.66]I do.
[268:00.20]I think it's great.
[268:05.40]I imagine this little teaser is a fraction of what is in the...
[268:09.78]I played Little Nightmares 1, but I didn't play any of the other ones.
[268:13.57]I don't know why.
[268:14.33]I really don't.
[268:15.97]I think I just kind of...
[268:18.62]The kind of exploration horror kind of games.
[268:22.22]There wasn't really puzzles.
[268:23.56]It was more like an exploration horror experience.
[268:26.70]But not really horror.
[268:27.53]More kind of thrilling and weird and interesting.
[268:32.87]2 was good.
[268:33.31]3 was shallow.
[268:45.55]3 is a different studio.
[268:53.17]I remember really liking Little Nightmares 1.
[268:55.77]That's the game where you are on the table and all the weird big fat people are jiving at you on the food and everything.
[269:02.74]That's that one, right?
[269:06.62]Yeah, that game is crazy.
[269:08.55]I really like that game.
[269:12.61]Oh, how do I duck?
[269:13.79]What's the duck button?
[269:18.94]He's going to look under.
[269:19.62]Are we going to make a break for it?
[269:29.72]He's going to look under.
[269:30.26]He's going to see me.
[269:30.70]He's going to see me.
[269:31.62]Oh, no, he's not.
[269:41.29]I almost just got shown.
[269:44.46]We go.
[269:44.80]We're good.
[269:45.24]Alright, let's go.
[269:52.64]Welcome back to Top 5.
[269:56.12]No, Top 20.
[269:58.81]I'm gonna break down the Top 20 Scariest Parts of the Little Nightmares 2 Demo.
[270:08.22]Man in Carriage.
[270:19.87]Should I go out that way?
[270:20.87]Do I have to follow him?
[270:30.07]Oh, we do have to follow him.
[270:31.51]Okay, sneak.
[270:40.90]Here are the top ten times I said, oh shit, in the Little Nightmares 2 demo.
[270:48.99]Oh shit!
[270:53.46]Where do we go?
[270:53.90]Where do we go?
[270:54.30]I'm going this way.
[271:05.86]OK, we need to hide.
[271:12.89]The game is called re animal.
[271:14.33]Yeah, why am I saying two little nightmares too?
[271:27.35]I waited till the last possible second right here, OK?
[271:48.23]Where are we trying to go?
[271:53.32]Oh, we're not trying to go in there.
[271:54.70]Okay, I thought we were trying to go in the other train for a second.
[272:04.81]Am I trying to go in the other train?
[272:07.50]Bro needs yellow paint.
[272:10.00]Shut up!
[272:35.47]Is he going to break this?
[272:52.72]Get in there.
[272:57.93]Okay, I think we're safe.
[273:02.69]Just checking.
[273:06.69]Just checking.
[273:08.93]There could be secrets down here.
[273:19.14]Wait, ooh.
[273:21.45]Watch it.
[273:32.14]Whoa!
[273:33.81]Oh shit!
[273:43.91]Oh shit.
[273:48.34]Oh shit.
[273:53.00]Oh shit.
[273:54.00]Oh shit.
[273:59.55]Okay, so what I want whoever's editing this, I want you to do that top 10 bit right there and then have the oh shits be cuts to the times I just said it right there, even if it's a jump cut going one second in the future.
[274:13.02]You know what I mean?
[274:13.52]That'd be like number two.
[274:15.04]I'll give you the numbers so you can do it.
[274:18.57]So this is the, I'll give you the voiceover right now.
[274:21.23]Let's make it so you get a good, clean audio on it.
[274:28.76]Welcome back to the scared network.
[274:32.47]No, delete that one.
[274:36.87]Something that you don't understand is scary games and me don't mix.
[274:41.15]That's why I'm going to give you the top five biggest oh shit moments from the Re-Animal demo on Steam Next Fest.
[274:49.66]Steam Next Fest is a demo showcase of games that have come out that are about to be out in the next few months to years.
[274:57.13]That's a ton of cool games, hundreds of things you can check out.
[275:00.66]This is, uh, that's gonna, people are gonna think it's sponsored.
[275:02.78]Wait.
[275:04.18]Don't use that one.
[275:05.08]People will think it's a sponsor.
[275:06.47]It's not.
[275:08.34]Cut into the middle of that one.
[275:10.28]This one.
[275:13.00]It's been super cool, and I've enjoyed it, and I've been really... Cut.
[275:17.61]We'll do another one.
[275:23.02]So here we go.
[275:24.12]Scary games and me don't mix.
[275:26.02]Here are my top five biggest oh shit moments in the Re-Animal demo on Steam Next Fest.
[275:33.58]What a scary one.
[275:35.96]Number five.
[275:40.28]Number four is a big one.
[275:44.87]Get a load of number three.
[275:49.49]Big, big scare at number two.
[275:54.30]Number one.
[275:56.80]Okay, so the last, like, you know where to put them, right?
[276:00.31]I think that might be kind of funny.
[276:06.00]However that turns out in the video, we'll see.
[276:10.72]Make sure to subscribe for more scary moments.
[276:17.05]No.
[276:18.71]Don't use that.
[276:19.21]I hate that.
[276:28.94]Uh, I think that's gonna be it.
[276:35.27]Like, scream, and subscribe.
[276:38.53]Oh my lord.
[276:45.44]Just make that a YouTube short, right?
[276:48.60]Did that just be like a 30 second YouTube short?
[276:50.91]Yeah, but then people will think it's real.
[276:52.57]Here's the thing.
[276:53.76]I know it's like, okay, you can make that shit a YouTube short and then people are going to fucking hate me.
[276:58.73]You know, people are going to watch that and be like, this is a fucking idiot.
[277:00.97]I hate this guy.
[277:07.42]I don't want people to think I'm actually really doing that.
[277:10.63]I feel like the heat to take from that is, this dude, who's this like, who's this top 10 YouTuber asshole?
[277:20.68]And then they watch any of the videos that I've ever had, and they watch any of my streams, and I can come across as that guy, right?
[277:26.67]Sometimes I go, what the heck just happened?
[277:29.99]They're gonna see that, and they're gonna, confirmation's gonna be confirmed.
[277:34.48]And their first impression of me was that video and they're going to keep it forever.
[277:46.00]Dude, I got introduced to you from the sus guy picture.
[277:48.58]You don't have any dignity left to lose.
[277:52.33]Yeah, but I didn't make the sus guy picture.
[277:55.09]Alright, I'm out of here.
[278:01.98]You found me through a fucking meme shit image that I didn't even make.
[278:08.81]And you're telling me that's my dignity?
[278:18.11]I am the sus guy.
[278:25.62]And just like that, the Joker comes out.
[278:34.65]I had a weird one today.
[278:36.13]I'm having too much fun.
[278:38.28]Sometimes I forget I'm talking to an actual group of people watching.
[278:41.08]I have too much fun.
[278:43.06]Just saying dumb fucking words.
[278:50.55]Where's my audio?
[278:59.53]We're done already?
[279:00.59]Yeah, it was going to be a short one today.
[279:02.25]It's been about five hours.
[279:04.42]Not super long.
[279:07.80]We love parasocializing with you.
[279:10.18]Don't say that.
[279:10.83]Don't use that word.
[279:13.59]You guys are all bees.
[279:15.45]No, there's no parasocial shit here.
[279:17.79]Cut that out.
[279:18.65]You're bees.
[279:19.17]We're bees.
[279:22.76]Everybody comes here, we all fuck around for a few hours, and that's it.
[279:28.28]There's some honey that gets made, and then everybody fuck off.
[279:32.09]You know what I'm saying?
[279:44.09]I already introduced you to my parents.
[279:54.22]Wait, you can hear this twice.
[280:04.54]Alright, that was a fun one.
[280:05.32]I had a great time.
[280:06.46]A lot of those games were really funny.
[280:07.52]Some of them were really fun.
[280:08.40]I'm looking forward to whatever they come out with.
[280:12.83]But I'll see you guys later.
[280:14.11]I'll probably see you on Thursday.
[280:16.41]I think we're going to play Lego Party with the boys.
[280:21.04]That's the idea.
[280:24.12]And then after that, it's SEGA CD time.
[280:28.27]I'll take my time with it.
[280:35.64]And again, I did a lot of research on how I would want to stream it.
[280:42.99]It was original hardware, using an upscaler, using other means to get in stream and capture these games.
[280:52.24]And I'm just going to do original hardware.
[280:54.98]So the chunky SEGA CD Model 2 is right next to me.
[280:59.23]I got a really cool upscaler.
[281:00.61]It should look pretty cool, but keep the same crustiness.
[281:07.84]And we got a lot to go through, so I'm looking forward to it.
[281:20.48]Have a great rest of your night.
[281:22.43]Thanks for sticking around.
[281:23.17]Thanks for hanging out.
[281:24.30]I'll see you again in a couple of days and we'll figure it out.
[281:27.45]Take care.
[281:28.84]Have a good one.
[281:29.54]Call your mother.
[281:30.56]See you later.
