[00:27.90]How are you?
[00:29.08]What's up?
[00:30.48]How you doing?
[00:34.20]Cool.
[00:35.08]Alright.
[00:36.26]How's food?
[00:37.20]Good.
[01:02.13]Still not quite ready.
[01:02.73]I've got to get my tea.
[01:04.45]I've got to get my water.
[01:05.25]I've got to get my toothbrush.
[01:06.99]I've got to brush my teeth.
[01:09.11]Not in that order.
[01:11.79]And if you believe the toothbrushing part, I can't help you.
[01:16.70]Ads are going to play.
[01:17.24]We're going to get rid of the pre-rolls.
[01:18.36]I'll be back in three or four minutes.
[01:22.54]Let's hope they start by the time I get back.
[01:26.00]And we'll play some Zombieville 3D.
[01:31.06]Alright, baby.
[06:10.73]OK, I think we got about five seconds.
[06:12.47]I'm good to go.
[06:15.41]I'm good to go.
[06:16.15]Hey, welcome back, everybody.
[06:18.01]Welcome to another Jerma985 live stream.
[06:21.02]And today we are going to be playing a fun game that I found on Steam.
[06:26.88]Fucking beer crack for this one.
[06:28.86]I can't fucking do this anymore.
[06:30.22]I can't fucking do this anymore.
[06:34.30]Alright, welcome back, everybody.
[06:45.28]It's a probiotic soda.
[06:46.56]Don't worry.
[06:50.48]How you doing?
[06:51.90]How are things?
[06:57.99]Yeah, I want to play.
[06:58.99]I know I'm jumping between game to game to game recently, but.
[07:04.73]This one was on the list.
[07:06.23]Looks really fun.
[07:08.13]I think this is another one of those games that came out like 15 years ago.
[07:12.51]And they got remade.
[07:17.37]Did you say Olipop his ass?
[07:19.31]Get out of here.
[07:31.22]I don't drink like 10 of them.
[07:33.40]That's the problem.
[07:33.90]People think it's a regular soda.
[07:35.08]It's a fiber soda.
[07:36.72]You can get some more fiber in your diet.
[07:39.48]Drink like one.
[07:46.85]This is a 2011 phone game.
[07:49.85]I'm into it.
[07:50.91]Okay, I saw the trailer on Steam and I was like, I kind of want to play this.
[07:53.42]This looks pretty fucking cool.
[07:56.04]Eat some vegetables?
[07:56.84]I do.
[07:58.02]I'm supplementing fiber into my diet.
[08:01.38]I eat plenty of vegetables.
[08:03.18]I eat plenty of fiber.
[08:04.06]A lot of whole grains.
[08:06.32]But it's easy to kind of get this for a little supplementation.
[08:14.57]Only an American would get their fiber from a soda.
[08:19.51]Watch this company be like based in the fucking UK or something.
[08:22.09]Let me see.
[08:24.95]California, never mind.
[08:29.35]Alright, let's do it.
[08:30.53]I'm ready to go.
[08:31.11]I'm ready to have some fun.
[08:35.09]There are Asian fiber sodas.
[08:38.62]Yeah, so what are you talking about?
[08:45.83]Alright, so this game is about upgrades.
[08:47.23]It's about shooting zombies.
[08:48.73]It's about... I'm interested.
[08:51.75]How's the volume?
[08:52.21]Good?
[08:55.57]Turn it up a little.
[08:59.81]Alright, WASD.
[09:01.57]I can hold a mouse to move too.
[09:02.89]That's cool.
[09:03.33]$500 for this bat.
[09:11.04]I think I'll probably just have to fight first.
[09:16.55]I don't have any z coins how do I wait I have one z coin oh guys I got one z coin this is perfect who am I going to spend this on I'm thinking doctor I'm thinking clown I'm thinking chef does this matter does that I don't think you get any points for this do they have different stats I don't know
[09:45.97]Mr. Disco is cool too.
[09:48.67]Goth girl.
[09:53.34]Oh, granny.
[09:54.12]This is going to be hard.
[09:57.58]I think it's between... Hold on, who else?
[10:05.52]No.
[10:10.58]I think it's going to have to be granny.
[10:11.55]Granny.
[10:15.49]I already made my decision.
[10:21.08]Cool, OK.
[10:22.70]So I have my pistols one fires OK left click.
[10:28.46]But perks.
[10:30.66]Max health.
[10:31.34]I don't have any money so.
[10:34.31]Records.
[10:36.43]OK.
[10:38.23]I'm just going to go.
[10:39.01]Let's do it.
[10:41.07]I like being able to hold down right click to move.
[10:42.95]That's so awesome.
[10:50.33]Alright, so I think I just have to... You have to shoot zombies and buy stuff and level up.
[10:54.98]Space is fire too.
[10:55.90]Okay.
[10:58.54]Hey, mouse sensitivity default is very good.
[11:00.68]I'm happy with it.
[11:01.66]I need to move my mic.
[11:02.48]Hold on.
[11:05.50]Okay, hold on.
[11:06.18]Maybe right click is not good.
[11:18.45]I already know I'm going to like this game a lot.
[11:20.55]I can already tell.
[11:30.94]It's like a mobile game without the mobile in it.
[11:33.28]Does that make sense?
[11:42.05]Pistol shoots pretty fast.
[11:45.80]So what's the goal?
[11:46.84]Do I have a goal?
[11:47.54]Is just survive as long as you can?
[11:55.85]Oh, hold on.
[11:58.19]Spitfire automatic.
[11:59.79]I want it in two.
[12:00.93]Okay.
[12:01.21]So what does this do?
[12:03.15]Ooh.
[12:03.33]Alright.
[12:03.65]That's pretty good.
[12:04.39]I'm going to save it though.
[12:05.81]Probably save it.
[12:12.95]Bro, granny is fucking ice cold.
[12:16.31]Sprint, good.
[12:27.32]Okay, it plays pretty clean, I will say.
[12:30.40]It's pretty clean.
[12:30.98]You can drop a weapon.
[12:34.14]Oh, mouse wheel is also good too.
[12:43.67]I heard that people love this game.
[12:46.63]Yeah, I think this is a... I think this is a classic, guys.
[12:52.16]Where do you get ammo?
[12:55.54]Oh, I think the top right is how hard it's getting.
[12:57.26]Alright, hold on.
[12:59.00]Don't fuck this up.
[12:59.62]Katana?
[13:01.32]I can sell it, too.
[13:02.24]Does it have durability?
[13:05.33]Ooh.
[13:06.09]Is there cleave?
[13:07.63]There is.
[13:14.14]Oh shit.
[13:18.65]Alright, I'm gonna get trapped here if I'm not careful.
[13:25.21]Z coin.
[13:27.15]Oh, hell yeah.
[13:28.95]Dude, I just got a Z coin!
[13:34.42]Lots of people when they play this game have trouble getting Z coins.
[13:37.20]But let me tell you, here are some secret Z coin areas that only I know about.
[13:42.12]top right area.
[13:43.40]In the top right area of the first map, there's a Z-Coin.
[13:47.97]Subscribe for more Z-Coin locations.
[13:49.69]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[14:03.76]I have worked out today for the first time in like five and a half years.
[14:08.04]And I have to say that my left wrist is a little weak right now.
[14:14.62]I'm like struggling to press the button.
[14:20.66]Alright, I'm trapped in the corner now.
[14:25.44]This is bad.
[14:26.36]I gotta get out of here.
[14:32.44]No, I worked out with... And you just got me killed.
[14:35.80]Now what happens?
[14:38.72]Rip.
[14:39.24]Okay.
[14:39.84]Alright.
[14:40.14]So what does that mean?
[14:44.93]Hey, what's your deadlift?
[14:46.63]Two seven pound weights holding on my sides and dipping down.
[14:52.53]That's what we're up.
[14:53.21]That's what we're doing now.
[14:53.91]That's what we're up to now.
[14:57.47]Alright.
[14:57.67]I got a thousand bucks.
[14:58.45]Cool.
[15:00.88]I guess you can unlock.
[15:04.34]Ah, OK, what about upgrades?
[15:11.01]20% more health.
[15:13.75]Damage reduction.
[15:16.05]Oh man, look at all this.
[15:20.32]I'm going to become obsessed with this game.
[15:25.44]Ah, burning or freezing duration.
[15:28.36]Melee kills cause extra money to drop.
[15:37.46]Is there a melee damage increase?
[15:40.50]Ooh.
[15:43.98]Ah, this is probably stupid, but I'm doing it.
[15:45.99]I need to buy a melee weapon.
[15:48.55]Alright, bat is 500.
[15:55.57]I'll take the bat.
[15:57.95]And I'll put it on two.
[15:58.73]Alright, granny with the bat.
[16:07.54]Let me unlock the clown too.
[16:09.16]Actually, I'm staying with Granny.
[16:18.27]It's so easy.
[16:18.83]It's so simple too.
[16:20.03]Oh, you lost?
[16:21.07]Okay, now just do it again.
[16:22.14]Here's some money.
[16:28.50]Why'd you spend all that money already?
[16:29.98]I don't know.
[16:30.44]Because I want to get extra damage.
[16:33.54]Alright, I'm walking in.
[16:36.06]This might be a controller game.
[16:37.25]I actually might plug one in.
[16:40.77]Look at that.
[16:41.11]Two hits.
[16:47.33]Beautiful.
[16:49.33]Let's go bottom right now.
[16:57.18]I think this is an iPad game.
[16:58.44]Good.
[17:01.66]That doesn't automatically disqualify it from being fucking fun, dude.
[17:04.52]Okay.
[17:11.34]The jazz in the background is pretty good too.
[17:17.52]Good.
[17:22.70]Med kit.
[17:23.14]Ooh.
[17:24.16]Ooh.
[17:24.98]Ooh.
[17:25.81]Why do I keep doing that?
[17:26.73]I've done... Since I've been streaming a lot lately, I've noticed that one of my new pull the cord in my back is... Ooh.
[17:35.51]I don't like it.
[17:36.13]I don't like that new catchphrase.
[17:37.83]I want to get rid of it.
[17:42.44]How do I... Okay, so there we go.
[17:50.97]I just was about to do it again.
[17:51.89]Ooh.
[17:51.97]Does right click do anything?
[18:04.28]Oh, no, right click runs.
[18:13.45]I got to level four last time, right?
[18:14.67]Alright, let's try.
[18:15.09]I'm going to beat this whole game.
[18:29.16]Any Z coins?
[18:29.74]If you see a Z coin, let me know.
[18:32.41]I'll make sure to just completely ignore it.
[18:37.59]Z coin.
[18:38.61]Ooh.
[18:42.01]A slugger.
[18:46.71]Holy shit, this thing is great.
[18:47.73]Alright, don't waste it, don't waste it.
[18:51.24]This big thing's coming.
[18:52.16]How much does this heal?
[18:54.64]Nice, okay.
[19:01.08]Is there rarity?
[19:01.70]Because the thing is blue.
[19:02.76]Alright, I'm not going to get stuck here.
[19:29.50]Give me that money quick.
[19:37.19]They take way... Look at how much they take now.
[19:38.97]I think I have to save melee.
[19:41.35]Is the game co-op?
[19:47.25]I think it actually is, yeah.
[19:50.17]There is a co-op mode.
[19:51.32]I don't know how good it is or how it works, but it is in the game.
[19:55.56]Yikes.
[20:05.25]progress officially better than last time nice alright that's almost that's like a 70 heal it's pretty good oh this is where the secret uh secret service comes out right
[20:37.36]Five stars.
[20:37.84]Shit.
[20:46.66]Way to get ammo.
[20:47.12]I don't know.
[21:04.16]Can I hurt this thing?
[21:14.20]I don't know what to do.
[21:16.66]Does he have a shit load of health?
[21:24.91]Fuck.
[21:26.81]Uh oh.
[21:30.60]Uh oh.
[21:31.80]Uh oh.
[21:33.14]Uh oh.
[21:57.71]Hopefully money doesn't despawn.
[22:02.97]Can I drop the shotgun maybe?
[22:04.25]Can I sell it?
[22:05.39]Hold Z. I think I have to be next to one of those things.
[22:08.46]Give me the money.
[22:13.98]No!
[22:16.40]No!
[22:31.01]So what happens if it goes all the way?
[22:38.36]There's no... I can't... I'm completely overwhelmed.
[22:40.30]I can't kill all these things.
[22:51.16]I gotta go find... I gotta go find other... Yeah, I gotta run.
[22:53.94]I'm dead.
[22:54.28]Alright.
[22:58.95]I, like, love this game.
[23:04.69]How long would I survive in a zombie apocalypse?
[23:07.27]Where do I get to drop off at?
[23:11.38]Do I get to be in a grocery store?
[23:12.68]Am I in a bunker?
[23:15.00]Where do I spawn?
[23:28.11]At a McDonald's?
[23:31.35]I'd probably last a while.
[23:38.29]If you wake up at home and shit hits the fan.
[23:39.83]Alright.
[23:40.03]If I woke up at home and shit hits the fan.
[23:42.50]How many cans of tuna fish do I have?
[23:45.48]That's an easy answer.
[23:46.62]At least 10.
[23:47.04]I always have at least like 5 to 10 cans of tuna fish in my house.
[23:51.26]Those are all going into a sack.
[23:53.89]Water.
[23:54.23]How much water?
[23:54.61]I'm going to fill up like a bunch of jugs of water.
[24:02.57]I got a fucking sword.
[24:07.07]Take the sword with me.
[24:14.52]You have armor.
[24:15.10]Why do you have a sword?
[24:18.10]I have multiple.
[24:19.20]I have two swords, guys.
[24:20.34]I have a rapier and I have a huge broadsword.
[24:25.34]So I'm definitely going to be fine for a little bit.
[24:33.47]I know I'm going to be like the like the pay to win guy that started with gear and probably just dies anyways.
[24:39.53]But I did.
[24:40.23]I'm going to start with some gear.
[24:46.84]Ooh.
[24:48.18]Fuck, I did it again.
[24:49.14]Did I do twin vipers?
[24:55.65]This seems kind of fun.
[25:01.37]I'm doing it.
[25:01.73]Let's do twin vipers, melee.
[25:06.26]Spending all my money.
[25:16.85]Okay, remind me I need to buy some of the default perks.
[25:23.12]Is it a real blacksmith sword or did you get it at Walmart?
[25:27.18]Um, I don't know very many Walmarts that sell rapiers.
[25:31.44]That's not really at Walmart.
[25:34.36]Yes, they were professionally made by a blacksmith.

[26:21.86]With a laughing out loud face.
[26:23.48]Okay, I don't have any money.
[26:39.12]Because a Ren Faire is just kind of like Walmart.

[26:42.23]No, it is not.
[26:46.41]Okay, the last time that... Holly and I went to a Ren Faire.

[27:00.74]Like, this is real.
[27:01.50]They're just saying that you're a nerd.
[27:07.54]Says the guy watching, a 39-year-old man plays Zombieville USA 3D on Twitch.

[27:16.81]We have to be honest with ourselves.
[27:18.53]40-year-old virgin?

[27:52.41]40-year-old mobile gamer.
[27:53.69]Alright, now that one is real.

[29:10.30]Look at this.
[29:10.58]Alright, hold that for later.

[29:56.80]You can play dead cells?
[29:58.34]Um... I think I tried it for... I didn't really get into it, though.

[30:50.90]I think you just have to dump ammo and then find crates, dump all the ammo, find crates.
[30:55.39]Yeah, I'm being too timid about this.
[30:57.69]You just got to obliterate everybody and just go to another crate.

[31:54.91]It's because I've worked out.
[31:55.79]And I haven't worked out in a long time, so I'm just fucking fucked up right now.
[32:00.10]Like my blood is flowing faster than it normally is.
[32:06.66]So it's just like everything's kind of like times two speed in my brain right now.
[32:12.13]Yeah, the pump is there.
[32:13.77]And I only use seven pound weights.
[32:19.11]Alright, don't tell anybody I said that, by the way.
[32:21.73]Talking about getting a pump on with seven pound weights is like... Hold on.
[32:26.48]Don't tell anybody I said that.
[32:35.94]Okay, um... I'm gonna replace this.
[32:39.33]And I'm gonna sell the gun.
[32:40.67]I can't.
[32:40.93]That's alright.
[32:41.35]That's fine.
[32:43.87]Now I understand how the game works.
[32:47.01]This dude is yoked.
[32:51.11]Hey, I already achieved absolute greatness when it comes to physique.
[32:56.68]So it's... And whatever, I don't care.
[32:58.36]It's a new game plus to me.
[33:04.09]Hey, that's the thing.
[33:05.53]When you achieve total fucking perfect physique, it doesn't matter.
[33:09.37]You're just a new game plus.
[33:11.03]Seven pound weights are... Who cares?
[33:25.68]This thing's actually really good.
[33:32.05]Bro, you are an average gym bro, not Fabio.
[33:54.97]A hundred, a hundred and fifty, a hundred and fifty five pound dude curling 35, 40 pound dumbbells of perfect form.
[34:04.70]Like I, I could have, I could have, I probably could have beat the shit out of Spider-Man is what I'm saying.
[34:08.30]Spider-Man didn't have anything on me.
[34:22.06]See, nowadays, uh, Spider-Man would just, like, kind of appear in the window, and I would go, and it would scare me, and I'd probably have a heart attack and die.
[34:30.85]But, we're talking about, like, 20, like, 2011.
[34:32.91]Spider-Man isn't real.
[34:55.96]You know, it's called a hypothetical fuckface question.
[35:07.19]How does everything have to be so literal?
[35:21.03]That wasn't a hypothetical or a question.
[35:25.13]Spider-Man appearing in my window is a hypothetical fucking stupid scenario.
[35:32.52]Are you drunk?
[35:45.32]Somebody said not drunk enough.
[35:49.04]Very drunk.
[36:01.74]I just like that somebody said crashing out.
[36:06.62]What the fuck?
[36:09.51]Kill it.
[36:12.49]Whoa, it has it.
[36:13.57]It's got a fucking radar gun.
[36:15.89]Wait a minute.
[36:16.23]Wait a minute.
[36:16.53]Wait a minute.
[36:16.91]Please don't die.
[36:17.41]I want to see what that is.
[36:31.40]Okay, I want to put it in one.
[36:39.15]That thing is a legendary.
[36:44.55]Holy shit.
[36:46.11]Oh my goodness.
[36:50.11]Use it or I guess you lose it, right?
[36:57.87]I just tried to dodge.
[37:03.70]Yeah, you guys say the same shit about me, by the way.
[37:05.77]Hey, Spider-Man's not real.
[37:08.14]Spider-Man's not real.
[37:35.50]Oh, we should have had a bullet.
[37:44.65]I got this is a good round.
[37:45.63]It's pretty good.
[37:51.91]What is that thing?
[37:54.48]Oh, flamethrower.
[37:57.50]Oh, I like it a lot.
[38:04.24]Please don't get killed.
[38:05.62]I want to see what he drops, please.
[38:12.99]Oh my goodness, this guy has so much health.
[38:16.93]Come on, really?
[38:19.62]Oh, I'm in trouble here.
[38:45.78]Need a crate.
[38:48.20]Oh my goodness, I didn't even look.
[38:53.03]Bye.
[38:59.91]Hey, I got 2600.
[39:07.69]3000.
[39:07.85]Um, what do you think?
[39:11.91]Weapon upgrades or perks first?
[39:18.20]This feels like it's almost a necessity, right?
[39:26.77]Get the money upgrade.
[39:30.45]Oh, this is important too though, right?
[39:37.17]Perks always, passives over instance.
[39:39.05]That's true.
[39:40.99]I'll take the health regen.
[39:44.64]Health regen and...
[39:53.95]I don't know.
[39:55.73]I don't want to spread out too, too thin though.
[39:59.41]I usually, this is like my favorite gun.
[40:02.27]I love these revolver type weapons.
[40:04.73]I'm gonna, I'm spreading out way too thin, but whatever.
[40:16.12]I love these things.
[40:16.84]Okay, well now I have regen.
[40:28.11]What's with the title?
[40:30.11]Um, oh, because this game is called Zombieville USA 3D.
[40:34.94]And back, I want to say 20, 30 years ago, putting 3D in your title was, whoa, this is a big thing that's going on right now.
[40:43.46]It's so-and-so 3D.
[40:45.30]Oh, this game is 3D.
[40:48.70]A gremlin's 3D.
[40:51.09]Then it turned into HD.
[40:53.57]Where is... Oh, everyone knows HD.
[40:55.45]Blah, blah, blah.
[40:56.55]HD.
[40:58.21]So and so.
[40:58.95]HD.
[41:00.66]The end of a title.
[41:01.74]Everything was called HD.
[41:04.88]Like Wolfenstein 3D.
[41:06.14]Wolfenstein HD.
[41:08.90]Then we went to VR.
[41:10.72]Wolfenstein VR.
[41:13.93]Super Mario VR, right?
[41:15.55]Everything had a VR on it.
[41:18.79]What's next after that?
[41:20.03]I think it's going to be MD.
[41:23.88]That's what I would do.
[41:29.32]Zombieville MD.
[41:32.64]Like, oh, this game is like, this game's medical.
[41:37.68]It's probably going to be AI.
[41:39.00]It's going to be so-and-so AI, da-da-da-da, AI.
[41:47.44]Sell it.
[41:48.98]You get a lot of money for doing that.
[42:03.89]Yeah, bro, we read the title.
[42:08.45]Yeah, well, somebody asked me about it.
[42:21.74]Did I tell you I worked out today?
[42:22.96]And I'm like feeling fucking fresh and like good.
[42:33.35]Alright, they have way too much health now.
[42:50.06]I haven't been up here yet.
[42:53.88]Can you work out every single day?
[42:55.38]We need this energy more often.
[42:58.95]Hey, my energy levels are going to be whatever they are.
[43:05.95]In two or three hours, guys, it's going to crash.
[43:08.11]It's going to crash out.
[43:09.26]I'm going to crash out.
[43:11.80]And I'm going to just play Fate for like four hours and fall asleep on camera.
[43:33.10]when are you gonna play arcs vitalis yeah I actually did like not let's dial it down a little I didn't set up the mod and I saw this and I wanted to play this so bad and I'm glad I did because I love it
[44:03.00]I guess the thing is good because it has piercing, but it doesn't do a whole lot of damage though.
[44:07.49]Uh oh, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[44:18.94]I killed that guy right there.
[44:42.76]Oh shit, that's a machine gun.
[44:43.74]I need it.
[44:44.04]I have to take them this way because I can't go over there.
[44:58.99]What?
[44:59.17]I have projectiles.
[45:00.47]Fuck.
[45:07.69]Hey, that's an AR actually.
[45:09.97]Whatever it is.
[45:13.06]Oh, hell yeah.
[45:14.26]This should be good.
[45:24.75]Still not enough.
[45:32.98]There's another weapon on the ground right now.
[45:36.22]It's not much money on the ground too.
[45:37.22]I'm going to be so pissed if I die here.
[45:44.02]I got most of it good.
[45:59.25]Hell yeah, let's go.
[46:00.89]Okay, I need to get a crate somewhere.
[46:02.47]Let's go top right.
[46:07.09]Hey, my cat likes you.
[46:07.97]Okay.
[46:11.18]Oh, what you can't save!
[46:14.62]Hey!
[46:15.06]Come here!
[46:16.02]Hey!
[46:17.16]What?
[46:18.18]Uh-oh!
[46:19.43]He's got such a cute nose!
[46:22.31]Look at his nose!
[46:25.57]He's purring!
[46:27.95]He's purring!
[46:28.68]Oh my god!
[46:34.05]Let me pet you.
[46:36.17]Ow!
[46:37.23]I just scratched my fucking hand!
[46:38.65]Alright, that was funny.
[46:41.88]Now I'm dead.
[47:05.95]It was a great cat moment.
[47:11.45]Oh perks, right, right, right.
[47:12.93]Thank you.
[47:19.14]That's good.
[47:25.00]That's good.
[47:25.54]I haven't really done this yet.
[47:35.75]Opening a weapon crate restores 2% ammo per rank.
[47:38.51]That's good too.
[47:41.23]Where's the money money?
[47:42.70]Here's the money drop by zombies by 4% per rank.
[47:45.16]Is that worth it right now?
[47:46.02]I guess you got to start doing it at some point.
[48:04.43]I almost want to just do the bat again.
[48:05.55]I'm gonna.
[48:10.07]I need some consistency.
[48:11.15]I gotta.
[48:11.85]I gotta have something that can clear.
[48:12.82]OK, alright, cool.
[48:18.58]I should be getting more money.
[48:21.56]I'm so tired I don't want to get up.
[48:22.91]Can you tell me too?
[48:23.59]You need a motivational speaker here, alright?
[48:26.84]Whatever you have to do today is what I want you to do.
[48:31.38]You want to get up right now.
[48:33.49]What I'm going to tell you what to do.
[48:35.05]Don't get up right now.
[48:37.01]Plan to get up in 25 minutes.
[48:41.34]That means that you give your brain a little bit of a leeway to get up and do whatever you need to do.
[48:48.30]25 minutes is actually a lot of time.
[48:50.10]It's enough time to get through whatever you, you know, I don't fucking feel like doing this.
[48:53.39]I don't feel like doing it.
[48:55.03]25 minutes.
[48:56.17]But actually do it though.
[48:57.47]Give that real go, but you're going to do it in 25.
[49:01.03]This is goofy ass music for this.
[49:02.66]Well, I didn't, I hit the pause button.
[49:13.20]Ooh, it's one hit to kill now.
[49:20.66]Yeah, five minutes is too short.
[49:21.88]Ten minutes is too short.
[49:23.32]More than 30 is a little too long.
[49:24.84]20 is even a little too short.
[49:26.95]25 minutes.
[49:29.95]Got something to do?
[49:30.83]25 minutes.
[49:32.59]Fuck, I gotta get that homework done.
[49:33.87]Do it in 25 minutes.
[49:37.27]Wasn't I supposed to... Ah, I gotta run some errands.
[49:38.84]25 minutes from now.
[49:51.42]What if I forget to do after 25 minutes?
[49:55.24]Well, then I don't know.
[49:57.80]That's on you.
[50:01.29]Yeah, not an hour.
[50:02.97]People saying, oh, just do it later.
[50:04.23]No, an hour is too long.
[50:08.41]An hour is enough time for you to get too relaxed again or too in your head again to not do it.
[50:14.02]25 minutes.
[50:17.64]Chainsaw.
[50:29.04]I mean, this thing's cool, but it kind of sucks.
[50:36.55]No, it's actually great because a lot of times you'll say in 25 minutes, then you'll just kind of chill and you'll have this moment where you go, ah, fuck, it's been 25 minutes, hasn't it?
[50:45.40]And you'll look over and it's only been like 12.
[50:48.74]Oh shit.
[50:49.36]Alright.
[50:50.40]We're good.
[50:53.62]25 minutes.
[50:53.94]This is a life hack.
[51:13.54]Alright, the sprint actually consumes a ton of stamina.
[51:19.39]So I'm not going to use it.
[51:26.23]Thanks for the motivation, I'm going to get up in 25 minutes.
[51:29.21]You're learning so well.
[51:42.08]There's a crate right there.
[51:45.59]Sorry, I was just, I was just motivationally speaking, okay?
[51:49.37]Sorry, I missed a crate.
[51:53.13]Ooh.
[52:01.42]Upgrading this thing would be kind of crazy.
[52:02.74]Alright, don't waste ammo.
[52:05.50]I got a lot of good stuff.
[52:12.76]What is the regen like?
[52:16.55]It's kind of terrible.
[52:17.35]It's not even happening.
[52:24.26]That's actually kind of good against the big guys, honestly.
[52:35.13]Is it actually regenerating?
[52:36.55]It's probably so slow.
[52:55.57]Why is grandma killing zombies?
[52:58.91]Grandma's doing what she needs to do to survive here.
[53:12.58]Okay, this thing is actually really good because they can't move.
[53:20.55]What do I want to replace?
[53:21.31]Oh, probably this.
[53:31.09]I should get pretty far on this one.
[53:35.29]I don't think I've gone up here yet.
[53:49.45]Oh my goodness.
[54:05.52]Alright, I need health.
[54:09.26]Please have health.
[54:22.62]Okay.
[54:24.37]Is it crossbow?
[54:26.99]Ooh, stop saying ooh.
[54:37.14]Oh, fuck you.
[54:38.72]He's still alive?
[54:48.39]Okay, hold on.
[54:49.11]I got a lot of good guns.
[55:04.40]Okay, top right.
[55:06.52]Six shots in the shotgun and I got a lot of bullets in that other thing.
[55:08.94]Cool.
[55:12.44]Slow down.
[55:12.82]Stamina.
[55:16.60]Wait for the stamina.
[55:28.25]Yikes, that hurt.
[55:30.01]What's with me today?
[55:31.53]I'm sorry.
[55:47.40]Okay, would you drop um cool They get to 5k I'll be happy at 5,000
[56:44.06]I don't need to shoot.
[56:44.68]Well, I don't shoot more than one of those kill everything.
[56:48.78]Holy shit.
[56:49.14]It's a big round.
[57:14.18]Let me get whatever that is and I'm good.
[57:21.35]Holy shit.
[57:21.87]You have so much health.
[57:24.39]Still alive.
[57:25.11]No way.
[57:30.71]No.
[57:30.93]Well, it was a good run.
[57:43.20]Not done yet.
[57:43.70]Hold on.
[57:57.47]Can I get the money at least?
[58:01.89]That was max.
[58:02.57]That was maxed out.
[58:10.72]Oh, nine.
[58:11.80]So when that thing fills up all the way, does that keep going?
[58:24.48]7500.
[58:24.52]Alright, what do I want to do?
[58:26.70]Crossbow goes crazy.
[58:38.01]I'll do a couple of clown rounds.
[58:39.07]I want doctor.
[58:41.63]Tycoon.
[58:43.61]And then chat's choice.
[58:45.33]What do you want?
[58:50.90]Goff?
[58:57.60]okay alright I'll play around with with goth girl I have a lot of money I just that was might have been a bad idea but I I feel like it's a good idea
[59:30.60]I feel like this is good too.
[59:32.38]Maybe armor?
[59:38.85]Total stamina and stamina regen.
[59:44.89]That's good.
[59:47.87]You can't handle me, goth girl, introverted extrovert, Libra Pisces.
[59:56.37]I love how our conversation boiled down to like three hashtags.
[60:03.84]I was talking for like probably 25 minutes.
[60:07.54]You know, this generation boils everything down to one sentence.
[60:11.14]There's like three words.
[60:12.30]This generation.
[60:14.56]Alright.
[60:21.99]What do I want?
[60:31.55]Take the damage, reduce.
[60:36.27]That's kind of huge too.
[60:37.25]I didn't even see this one.
[60:38.21]Maybe I should look at them first.
[60:43.09]Good.
[60:44.66]Good, yeah.
[60:48.90]That's good.
[60:53.68]Good.
[60:56.68]I feel like if I'm doing melee, I should probably get this.
[61:04.74]I might just do that again next time.
[61:06.12]Alright, I'm going to get up and stretch.
[61:10.51]It's been an hour.
[61:12.23]I will see you guys in about three and a half minutes, four minutes or so.
[61:17.51]Vampire will be good too.
[61:22.12]Your generation boiled eggs.
[61:25.26]Boiled eggs are delicious and I don't understand.
[61:29.62]You are not speaking for your generation, I don't think.
[61:31.96]I think your generation actually likes poached eggs and egg salad and stuff.
[61:36.32]I don't, I think you're speaking for just yourself.
[61:37.82]Alright, I'll be right back.
[61:53.28]Uh, as we'll start in about 15, 20 seconds.
[61:54.95]See you soon.
[67:04.92]How are you?
[67:05.60]Welcome back.
[67:13.71]But prefer plastic or ceramic toilet seats.
[67:16.51]Whatever one is a warmer.
[67:19.39]Whatever one gets warmer faster.
[67:24.72]As nothing worse than.
[67:27.30]Cold toilet seat, especially in the morning.
[67:39.52]Leather?
[67:40.98]Who is sitting down on a leather toilet seat?
[67:50.99]Carpeted toilet seat.
[67:54.01]You are out of your mind.
[67:55.71]Okay.
[68:05.41]I'm going to play as goth girl and I just got upgrades and I'm ready to get more money.
[68:13.04]Let's go.
[68:13.88]Let me go.
[68:14.70]I'm going to be for one second.
[68:15.74]I'm going to move the mic.
[68:20.80]Better.
[68:21.06]Alright, let's go.
[68:25.77]That coin.
[68:39.45]Isn't this the same company that made, um, what's it called?
[68:43.80]Battleheart Legacy?
[68:47.00]That's actually one of my favorite, uh, iPad games of all time.
[69:01.97]Boomer Video Game Podcast?
[69:04.01]Mika Mobile on the Steam page.
[69:05.49]Oh yeah, that's, that's them.
[69:09.95]I would love a Battle Heart Legacy.
[69:13.87]Do what they did to this game to Battle Heart Legacy.
[69:16.85]I would love a Battle Heart Legacy 2.
[69:23.46]He has favorite iPad games.
[69:28.68]How?
[69:30.12]Did you just get here?
[69:32.05]Did you just get here?
[69:32.97]How many of you guys just got here?
[69:37.78]I love iPad games.
[69:40.08]Did you just get here?
[69:48.29]I used to have Apple Arcade, but not anymore.
[69:51.43]I feel like Apple Arcade didn't come out with shit for a long time.
[69:53.61]It was just like, oh, and this is, again, I thought this game was fun.
[69:57.43]But they kept advertising the Sasquatch game where you steal the lunch from people.
[70:04.85]It was like that for like fucking eight months.
[70:14.42]I swear, like a year went by and there was only like a few things that were ever added.
[70:17.91]So I stopped using it.
[70:21.35]And again, that game was fun.
[70:22.23]I actually, I genuinely enjoyed that game.
[70:30.23]But I, I mean, I haven't looked at it or cared about it in at least a year.
[70:33.49]So who knows?
[70:34.17]Maybe there's a bunch of shit there now.
[70:41.08]I want a crate.
[70:41.62]There we go.
[70:49.88]Ooh, better than that.
[70:55.56]Okay, that regen is actually doing work now.
[71:14.81]Mobile game grab bag screen?
[71:19.46]I'm into it.
[71:22.67]I'm down for sure.
[71:23.33]Do you ever play pocket card jockey on iPad?
[71:40.82]I have not.
[71:41.40]I played a lot of Balotr though.
[71:46.68]I know that, like, Balatro is seen as, oh, it was nominated for Game of the Year.
[71:51.16]That actually might be one of the best games ever made.
[71:56.54]I have to say that.
[71:57.26]That actually might be the best.
[71:59.00]It's in the conversation, I think, for sure.
[72:00.60]I actually think it is.
[72:12.26]It's just one of the only experiences that I can always go back to and have just as much fun as I did the first time I played it.
[72:20.43]That's rare.
[72:21.49]That is not normal.
[72:27.61]I'd say some of the only games where that's ever happened with have been Team Fortress 2.
[72:33.68]Diablo.
[72:34.80]Diablo II, I would say.
[72:38.15]Um... Shit, I just had another one in my head and it was like a really good one.
[72:43.11]Hold on, I'll think about it in a second.
[72:45.93]Shit.
[72:46.77]I just had a good one too.
[72:48.09]One that I can always go back to.
[72:49.29]Balatro.
[72:50.52]Fuck.
[72:51.64]Dark Souls.
[72:52.10]There it is, yeah.
[72:53.80]Uh, all the FromSoftware games between Dark Souls 1 all the way through to obviously Elden Ring is the same thing as well.
[73:06.59]So it's up there.
[73:07.65]That's in very few company.
[73:10.89]Let's put it that way.
[73:20.13]I need something way stronger than this.
[73:28.98]I got to get in there.
[73:31.28]Just got to get in there.
[73:31.96]It's going to hurt, but it's alright.
[73:35.38]I'll regenerate back.
[73:35.96]It's fine.
[73:41.43]I had to get in there.
[73:44.82]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[73:58.20]Shit.
[73:58.64]Okay, I'm in trouble.
[74:14.93]Remind me to buy the health packs.
[74:20.01]Sorry, I was looking at chat.
[74:25.38]The best two-letter title ender was obviously DX.
[74:32.12]Yeah, DX did show up quite a few times.
[74:34.78]You're right.
[74:35.36]DX.
[74:36.84]And that meant the cool version.
[74:41.24]Sonic Adventure DX.
[74:42.32]Yeah, that's what it was.
[74:48.13]OK.
[74:50.61]I want to buy the health pack.
[74:58.62]I can upgrade it too.
[75:06.65]Every DS game had a DS acronym, yeah.
[75:13.87]Was it short for deluxe?
[75:16.46]I think so.
[75:17.44]Or I think the person, the original comment was Director's Cut.
[75:21.02]Director's Edition or something.
[75:28.52]Deluxe.
[75:31.12]And then if you were really cheeky, it would be Deluxe HD.
[75:43.78]When are we going to get TF2 DX?
[75:48.56]TF2 DX would end up being a... Oh, shit.
[75:56.09]What the hell?
[75:59.07]Right off the bat, two chests?
[76:00.09]Are you kidding me?
[76:00.87]What the fuck?
[76:03.52]This is crazy.
[76:07.50]TF2 DX would end up being... That's what, like, orange crit servers are, guys.
[76:13.16]That's already in the game.
[76:25.75]If somebody said BS, add like... Sonic Adventure BS!
[76:32.71]And it's a buggy-ass, broken fucking version of the game.
[76:35.29]That would be great.
[76:45.69]These are everywhere right now.
[76:46.91]What is going on?
[76:47.57]Mmm, sell it.
[76:55.19]Super Mario VS. I don't even know why this is making me want to do this, but... Game on, get your game on.
[77:17.54]You know you better play your cards right.
[77:20.86]You better get your game on.
[77:22.34]What is that?
[77:23.32]Why do I want to do that right now?
[77:29.13]That's compelling me to do that.
[77:30.87]That's a Yu-Gi-Oh.
[77:32.04]Okay, Yu-Gi-Oh GX.
[77:33.60]Because I'm thinking of DX.
[77:35.54]I thought it was Yu-Gi-Oh DX.
[77:39.30]It's Yu-Gi-Oh GX.
[77:41.14]Generation X. Yeah, that's back when they said the name of the title of their shit in their intros.
[77:55.97]I missed that time.
[78:00.98]Everybody gave me shit about the SCORN thing, but people used to do that.
[78:03.59]It used to be, if the name of your show was... Like, Barry and the fucking zombie apocalypse.
[78:11.53]It would be like, Barry and the zombie apocalypse.
[78:14.85]He's trying to avoid the danger.
[78:16.96]You don't know, what the fuck do you know?
[78:29.43]Resident Evil, you press start on the Resident Evil 1, the original disk, and they said, Resident Evil, you better play your cards right.
[78:54.77]Devil May Cry?
[78:55.49]I think they do that as well, yeah.
[78:58.35]Doesn't Dante go, Devil May Cry?
[79:01.69]Or something like that.
[79:03.39]He says, he does that, doesn't he?
[79:07.27]Devil May Cry.
[79:09.71]Dream on.
[79:19.87]That's Sonic?
[79:21.61]Does Sonic say the name of the game?
[79:23.49]Is it Sonic Adventure 2?
[79:25.82]Does he?
[79:33.88]Yeah, anime does it as well.
[79:36.33]Yeah, Fullmetal Alchemist.
[79:41.29]Yeah, they say the name of the episode.
[79:42.81]It's like Fullmetal Alchemist and the sun that rises the next morning.
[79:51.19]Yeah, what the fuck?
[79:52.05]They still do this.
[79:57.35]Mario Kart, yeah.
[79:59.91]I feel validated right now.
[80:08.25]Yeah, Mario Odyssey, Mario Galaxy.
[80:10.68]You guys are dicks.
[80:14.12]And he elongates it for a while too.
[80:16.88]It's Super Mario Galaxy!
[80:24.36]Oh, hold on.
[80:24.92]I don't want to die.
[80:27.40]I got to replace that with four.
[80:31.33]Damn, this thing's good.
[80:41.98]Super Smash Brothers, yeah.
[80:56.97]Did they say Evangelion?
[80:58.57]Does it go... Does it go... Neon Genesis Evangelion!
[81:06.76]Taken?
[81:07.30]It doesn't do that in Taken.
[81:29.36]I gotta get through this because he.
[81:35.32]Grenade launcher.
[81:36.24]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[81:37.68]I need to hold on to this.
[81:49.02]Fuck.
[81:50.54]Do not do that again.
[82:03.45]How many of these are you going to eat?
[82:10.72]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[82:16.63]No, no, no, no, no.
[82:18.27]There's so much stuff over there.
[82:19.23]I can't lose this.
[82:33.24]Did it despawn?
[82:35.18]No.
[82:35.56]Did everything despawn?
[82:43.22]That heals for a lot.
[82:45.47]Did everything despawn?
[82:46.39]Am I crazy?
[82:47.83]No.
[82:51.69]That sucks.
[82:59.21]Those guys explode and I keep not realizing it.
[83:04.25]I'm running this way.
[83:04.90]I gotta run.
[83:07.80]Give me a chest or something.
[83:13.68]I'll get trapped in here if I'm not careful.
[83:14.86]I just gotta get in and get out.
[83:16.71]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[83:17.93]Come on, come on, come on.
[83:21.03]Ooh.
[83:21.19]Uh-huh, uh-huh.
[83:38.61]Watch out for your health.
[83:39.27]I'm good.
[83:41.95]I'm in a mood today.
[83:42.75]I don't know.
[83:46.91]I'm dialed up.
[83:54.70]Dialed in as well, though.
[83:55.72]This is the best round so far.
[83:59.26]And I have four Omega heals, so I should be fine.
[84:06.56]A lot of projectiles.
[84:24.73]I think the, is the katana better?
[84:27.20]Is purple better than yellow?
[84:46.03]Good.
[84:47.01]Oh, I need that.
[84:48.25]I need that.
[84:48.85]I need to put it on three.
[84:50.01]Uh-oh.
[84:51.28]Alright, I'm at level 10.
[84:58.98]Okay, heal.
[84:59.56]Alright, good.
[85:01.03]Let's go.
[85:04.85]Purple's unusual.
[85:05.61]Fuck you.
[85:13.37]God, come on.
[85:25.34]Most money I ever got was 7,500.
[85:48.11]Is there anything after level 10?
[85:50.57]Or am I just going to like die?
[85:53.59]Yeah, it is.
[85:54.39]It's building up again.
[85:55.09]Is it 11?
[86:12.62]I'm gonna get overwhelmed here in a second at least let me just get the money I kind of like this better the cleave is better
[86:51.83]My head just that was gone, OK?
[87:00.13]5900 collected thought I got more than that.
[87:01.61]Alright, I'm going to do it again.
[87:09.54]And I'm going to do I'm going to do region again.
[87:16.46]Like a weirdo.
[87:24.57]I have no money for anything else.
[87:31.22]We're at the start of Citizen Kane when Orson Welles looks into the camera and says Citizen Kane.
[87:35.62]I want them to do shit like that again.
[87:55.67]pure cinema yeah bring back the weird goofy shit I don't give a fuck about movies anymore I just don't bring back the goofy shit
[88:20.71]People still make them.
[88:23.07]Some of the independent studios still make some wild kind of interesting stuff, right?
[88:36.37]Alright, what's a regen like now?
[88:42.79]That's pretty good.
[88:45.01]Yeah, that's good actually.
[88:46.47]I can just run away and regen.
[88:49.17]I'm going to go full regen Andy.
[88:55.79]Cryo gun.
[88:56.73]Oh, this is the freezing thing, I think.
[88:59.88]That's cool.
[89:02.26]And you can shatter them.
[89:34.02]Is Willem Dafoe in that movie?
[89:39.04]Willem Dafoe, is Willem Dafoe in the movie?
[89:43.86]He is.
[89:44.34]Okay, now I have to see it now.
[89:46.16]Grenades.
[89:56.33]Like, I don't care.
[89:57.41]If Willem Dafoe is in something, I have to see it.
[90:00.19]Like, Willem Dafoe could do the tutorial Battle Pass video for, like, the next, like, fucking AAA game, and I would be like, this is unbelievable.
[90:14.17]It doesn't matter what it is.
[90:15.63]It's gonna be good because he's in it.
[90:36.41]Willem Dafoe is just such a great actor because it feels like he's kind of just down for fucking anything.
[90:44.15]He's down for anything.
[90:49.80]And whatever it is, he does a damn good job doing it.
[90:52.40]It could be anything.
[91:09.71]Did you watch the lighthouse?
[91:12.31]I hate to say this and I'm gonna really not sound like a real Willem Dafoe fan.
[91:16.91]I have not seen the lighthouse and I think about it every day.
[91:28.92]Because I always want to be in the perfect mood for it because I know I need to.
[91:32.80]I know it's bad.
[91:36.11]That's like saying you're a huge 80s movie buff and you've never seen Robocop, right?
[91:40.07]Like that's... What are you talking about?
[91:46.34]Our grenades.
[92:14.39]Oh, what do I replace here?
[92:15.89]Grenades, I think.
[92:16.72]Let's get rid of the rest of them and then... Could I not get... Could I not get fucking killed by this?
[92:37.95]I could also sell it too, which is probably what I should be doing.
[92:45.83]this thing is actually amazing I gotta start getting a purple gun to start with that's my biggest problem alright let me regen for a little bit and run I think you can only sprint oh no I can't okay
[93:27.32]game has ray tracing yeah but ray tracing just that button is permanently off because all ray tracing is is make my computer run 40 slower that's all it does oh and and and reflections are a
[94:03.78]I don't think that's going to do damage.
[94:04.90]Alright, I got to run.
[94:10.01]What the fuck?
[94:13.45]Oh, my combo.
[94:17.97]No, no, no.
[94:30.65]This would be great where the grenades would shine right here.
[94:36.21]It has to do x2 damage or something, right?
[94:41.23]They get frozen?
[94:41.83]I think that might be a perk.
[94:55.40]Don't get out of here.
[94:59.24]Okay, so ray tracing would just make this puddle look like 10% brighter.
[95:11.31]Oh, I gotta, whatever it is I need it.
[95:13.73]Oh, I'm dead.
[95:14.45]See you later.
[95:15.31]Alright, fuck.
[95:16.35]Uh, okay.
[95:31.50]I gotta start coming in with something better here.
[95:36.87]I really like the shotgun.
[95:40.38]I really like the... Grenade launcher was good.
[95:46.62]I need something with a... There's a sniper rifle.
[95:50.17]Hold and release?
[95:54.21]I'm curious.
[95:54.75]I want to try it.
[96:07.89]You said Cheez-Its are a when I'm done snack.
[96:09.89]Does this only pertain to low amounts or is it safe to eat an entire box while watching a streamer play?
[96:15.70]Um... Okay, so when the Halloween, uh, honor system, uh, trick-or-treat bowl is out there, do you take the whole bowl like a fucking little asshole?
[96:30.29]No.
[96:31.21]Just take, just eat as much as it's like worth eating.
[96:39.04]Does this show accuracy?
[96:40.06]That'd be funny if it does.
[96:42.61]Peak difficulty was level 11.
[96:43.99]Alright, I can get better than that.
[96:55.50]I would say if you're... Hold on, I want to be... Let's be clown this time.
[96:59.86]Perfect.
[97:03.30]Ignore the candy, but you just take the Tupperware.
[97:08.54]That's... That's worse.
[97:09.74]I guess... How does this work?
[97:24.17]Hold and release into precision.
[97:25.65]You know what?
[97:27.89]I just want the money.
[97:34.77]Okay.
[97:35.35]I get it.
[97:36.09]That actually might be a lot of damage.
[97:46.43]This game is pretty sick.
[97:47.27]I'm not going to lie.
[97:47.89]This is actually a lot of fun.
[97:57.15]Only 40?
[97:57.61]I get that for killing two zombies.
[97:58.91]Never mind.
[97:59.29]Maybe I shouldn't be selling them.
[98:05.46]I got to find a place.
[98:06.06]I'm going to go into the corner and just stay in the corner.
[98:10.36]We're going to do left for dead bathroom strategy when the tank comes.
[98:17.07]What a fun game that was.
[98:18.29]I remember that was the funniest shit in the world.
[98:24.99]Four... I remember just me and like some of my bros, like four dudes sitting in a bathroom.
[98:31.25]And this goofy, huge Thanksgiving turkey is running around screaming, trying to get into the bathroom.
[98:45.98]and you see the little indicator pop up of somebody unloading a whole magazine in the back of your head accidentally it's like well that whatever I think you're at like 30 HP and nothing even hurt you Francis check your fire
[99:18.61]I don't know, some of you might not have been around for that era.
[99:22.81]But that was a good era.
[99:24.59]That was a great era.
[99:25.51]It's not that old of a game.
[99:40.20]No, but it kind of is though.
[99:44.52]Left 4 Dead 1 in particular, what was that?
[99:48.52]2007?
[99:48.98]2006?
[99:49.70]That's a long time ago.
[99:50.66]That's almost 20 years ago.
[99:54.39]That was a long time ago.
[99:59.61]That was 18 years ago.
[100:05.31]Think about that.
[100:05.79]That's when the Wii was in its heyday.
[100:08.15]You don't think that was that long ago?
[100:10.17]That was a long time ago.
[100:24.10]How old do you think we are?
[100:25.50]We had this conversation like four or five days ago.
[100:30.82]Like 55% of this entire audience is over the age of 30.
[100:36.96]We already talked about this.
[100:55.74]Oh, do I just sell it?
[100:56.63]Yep, who cares?
[100:57.99]I want the money.
[101:11.24]Yeah, we're just talking about chatters.
[101:13.36]Here's something interesting, right?
[101:14.52]So how many, there are 12, 12 and a half thousand people here.
[101:17.64]There's probably only a couple thousand people in the chat.
[101:22.85]How many are lurking?
[101:25.83]Oh, this thing is actually amazing.
[101:27.71]Line them up.
[101:41.52]When I watch streams, I don't really say anything.
[101:45.38]Unless I'm in Squeaks' stream.
[101:48.63]I think I talked in Squeaks' stream the other day more than I've written a message in any chat room combined for the entire time I've had an account.
[102:02.59]I was just, I was just fucking, I was talking in there like all day.
[102:11.23]He was playing Insane Aquarium as one of my, that's like my top, one of my top 10 favorite games of all time.
[102:21.08]Alright, help me out again.
[102:21.82]Is purple better than yellow?
[102:23.92]Because that thing is yellow and I have a purple bat right now.
[102:26.86]Is purple bat better?
[102:33.89]Yellow is better?
[102:36.39]Okay, it's plus three.
[102:37.37]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[102:38.37]Thank you.
[102:48.34]That regen is... Look at how much work that regen's doing.
[102:52.06]I've had to heal once.
[103:06.49]Oh, shit.
[103:10.57]Thank you.
[103:10.83]It's funny.
[103:11.11]I'm out of here.
[103:13.46]I need some... I'm out of ammo.
[103:17.06]Oh, what is it?
[103:18.12]Yep.
[103:18.84]Thunder God plus six.
[103:23.79]These are explosive rounds?
[103:26.29]Damn.
[103:29.39]This thing is disgusting.
[103:30.51]Okay.
[103:31.35]Selfie?
[103:32.21]Spitfire?
[103:41.82]Stop spamming.
[103:51.09]I don't have enough bullets.
[103:51.95]Don't spam.
[104:04.70]Z coin, let's go.
[104:08.12]Are you a person in the chat right now?
[104:09.41]324 people said yes.
[104:09.85]Almost at level 10, good.
[104:10.45]Don't knock.
[104:10.77]Okay, I got it.
[104:34.35]This thing is crushing.
[104:35.25]This has a modifier on it.
[104:41.46]Oh, boy.
[104:42.70]Ooh, plus six.
[104:45.20]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[104:46.70]I got to get down there.
[105:07.17]That guy's going to explode.
[105:07.97]Don't blow that up.
[105:08.69]Give me the money and get out of here.
[105:13.30]Fuck.
[105:13.72]It's okay.
[105:23.41]Let me round it up to 10k.

[106:43.04]I thought it was a minigun.
[106:47.46]That's a weak-ass minigun.
[106:48.92]It had like 10 bullets.
[107:06.42]Oh, die already, you piece of shit.
[107:12.55]Uh... Shot off?
[107:16.57]Holy shit, that was a lot of death.
[107:25.80]Oh my god, don't die.
[107:26.86]There's a lot of money here.
[107:33.36]No, I just want the money, please!
[107:43.33]There we go.
[107:43.86]Nice.
[107:47.26]There we go.
[107:50.10]Alright, I gotta find something else.
[108:00.13]Back here?
[108:00.59]Don't.
[108:14.93]I can't move.
[108:15.47]Come on, sprint!
[108:21.36]Sprint!
[108:30.13]Fuck, it's okay.
[108:30.69]Hey, I was supposed to get up in 25 minutes.
[108:33.01]That was 75 minutes ago?! !
[108:38.74]You broke... That's the rule.
[108:40.46]You broke that rule.
[108:41.84]You're supposed to get up and get... You're supposed to get up.
[108:50.46]Oh, no.
[108:52.60]That was 75 minutes ago.
[108:54.24]That's like a whole movie.
[108:55.88]Yeah.
[108:59.44]Okay.
[109:00.18]Listen.
[109:02.12]In 25 minutes, I want you to get up.
[109:05.61]Let's motivate you for a second here.
[109:07.31]In 25 minutes, I want you to think to yourself, what can I be doing right now?
[109:16.38]Am I just going to be an absolute idiot?
[109:19.44]Am I just going to be an absolute moron and just do this again?
[109:23.46]Yeah.
[109:30.14]I almost have this maxed out.
[109:34.12]That was stupid.
[109:47.37]Santa with two guns I like this one doctor is kind of cool
[110:16.31]Alright, I'll do this one.
[110:18.92]Uh, yeah.
[110:20.28]We'll do princess.
[110:28.38]Uh, I have had no upgrades to anything besides health regen.
[110:33.07]I spent $20,000 on it.
[110:45.35]Hey, but I know that I'm not going to have to do it ever again.
[110:47.29]Let me see how it is now.
[111:00.71]Okay, I'm drinking a permanent health potion now.
[111:03.30]That's awesome.
[111:10.76]I do need better weapons though.
[111:11.76]These things are dog shit.
[111:16.31]Fuck, Marry, Kill, Left 4 Dead, Tank, Boomer, and Hunter.
[111:26.64]That's Marry, Tank.
[111:27.40]I feel like he'd be protected forever.
[111:31.36]I feel like Tank's pretty loyal, right?
[111:36.49]I'm going to kill the Boomer.
[111:37.59]I mean, it's just dead.
[111:39.31]I'll fuck the Hunter.
[111:40.07]There you go.
[111:41.15]Boomer would just, I don't know.
[111:42.03]I feel like Boomer's just...
[111:44.55]puking and acid everywhere.
[111:46.11]Hunter I feel like is... I don't think I'm... not marriage material, but... you know.
[111:55.10]Gotta have a little bit of fun.
[112:11.09]What's your favorite cake?
[112:12.07]You asked that question yesterday!
[112:15.33]And I spent 20 minutes talking about it!
[112:28.76]What is that?
[112:40.45]I love the hunter.
[112:41.43]There was a... Okay.
[112:43.91]I was watching a Poke stream one time.
[112:48.00]And he was watching videos.
[112:49.40]Poke is the master of short videos, by the way.
[112:52.16]He'll be watching something randomly.
[112:54.56]There was a video.
[112:56.86]Polly and I have been trying to find this video for like 100 years now.
[113:00.98]It's a Spider-Man balloon that is floating around.
[113:05.27]And it plays the...
[113:09.93]hunter sound and the balloon gets loose and it's like a cctv footage of of this Spider-Man kind of Spider-Man balloon just kind of sitting around and it floats up fast after being let go into the camera and it goes yeah and it's one of the funniest videos I've ever seen and I don't I don't know where to get it I don't know where to find it
[113:48.26]Does somebody got it?
[113:49.86]Somebody found it?
[114:01.68]Man, you guys are quick.
[114:05.00]Oh, wait, wait.
[114:05.64]Maybe you can help with this one too.
[114:06.44]There's a video.
[114:07.54]It was a TikTok video.
[114:08.46]And it was a video.
[114:09.20]It was about like shrimps eating something.
[114:11.36]Like little shrimps.
[114:12.24]They were like baby shrimps or krill or something.
[114:15.46]And the video goes like...
[114:24.41]And they're eating this... I don't know, it's like an apple or something.
[114:27.59]Anybody have that one too?
[114:36.55]You guys are fast.
[114:37.65]Holly would be very happy if you found that one.
[114:59.69]No, is somebody linking the six flags guy?
[115:14.67]Sometimes I'll look at the Reddit.
[115:17.85]Gerber Reddit.
[115:18.39]And I'll just be like, oh, what the fuck am I going to see today?
[115:22.10]What fucking bullshit am I going to see today?
[115:26.60]And people sometimes will say what I pick up and, hey, hey, this is, anybody find this clip?
[115:34.00]I don't know when it was.
[115:34.86]I think Gerber was talking about how he had a diaper on and I don't know.
[115:38.48]He's playing a game where he was like driving around.
[115:40.30]It was like farm animals in it.
[115:42.86]And somebody would be like, oh, here it is, dude.
[115:45.97]Thanks, man.
[115:47.63]He's just like, what the fuck is going on?
[116:00.98]Yeah, he specifically was talking, I think he was, he specifically did, he's talking about, uh, like Richard Nixon.
[116:05.14]He did like an impression of Richard Nixon.
[116:07.44]Oh, yeah, I got you.
[116:08.42]Like less than, less than 12 minutes later.
[116:10.20]Yeah, here it is.
[116:12.42]Oh, thanks, man.
[116:13.16]I was looking for this one.
[116:15.44]Why are you looking for that one?
[116:17.40]Can I ask the question to those of you like clip people?
[116:20.29]Why are you looking for that clip of me doing a Richard Nixon impression?
[116:28.24]Oh, there's a lot of money there.
[116:29.26]Hold on.
[116:47.22]nice give me the money please oh give it to me what is it it's crazy whatever it is okay that's a cryo gun it ran out alright I gotta let me run and regen run and regen
[117:26.81]A lot of bits or sounds will live in my mind rent free and I can't find them.
[117:32.41]I feel that.
[117:32.93]It's true.
[117:36.69]I can understand that.
[117:39.80]And I guess this channel and other channels around it have been around for a long, long time, so... Instead of being... Oh, yeah, that clip of Jerma talking about Richard Nixon.
[117:53.24]Uh, there's 65,000 hours of videos to go look for that.
[117:57.90]I guess, yeah, that's a long time.
[118:02.90]Oh, don't.
[118:04.46]Please don't do that.
[118:21.14]Maybe I'll upgrade the sniper rifle.
[118:22.42]Because it goes through everybody.
[118:30.65]Okay, if you leave the screen, it despawns.
[118:32.97]If you go more than one or two screens away, all the money goes away.
[118:35.23]Everything goes away on the ground.
[118:38.73]Remember that for your playthrough.
[118:52.01]shit I need that uh what's the one that makes so I don't like that I don't get grabbed and stuck so fast
[119:32.09]I didn't even look at my health pool.
[119:33.65]My health pool was at zero.
[119:35.03]I didn't even pay attention.
[119:43.48]I read the chat for too many times.
[119:45.98]Uh, people recreated the teacher noise in different languages.
[119:48.08]Yeah, I saw that.
[119:48.58]It was funny.
[119:48.98]Okay, don't upgrade this again.
[119:58.31]Remember when you started whipping your ass on stream?
[120:01.09]That is a made-up moment.
[120:04.11]And you probably just found yourself in a timeout, if I would imagine.
[120:14.92]I kind of want to upgrade health.
[120:24.36]You did, though.
[120:25.30]No, I did not, actually.
[120:39.65]That was my favorite stream to be honest.
[120:43.95]What he said?
[120:44.93]What did he wait wait wait wait?
[120:48.79]He said.
[120:52.73]Wiping.
[120:56.79]But that's not better.
[121:03.92]That's OK.
[121:04.78]That is actually that's worse.
[121:12.71]That's way worse.
[121:13.51]I'm glad I misread that the other way.
[121:21.51]By the money upgrade.
[121:27.70]OK, is that 8% now?
[121:36.74]Alright, I'm gonna take a break.
[121:38.40]I'll be back.
[121:41.66]I think that's a good point to stretch my legs and get some more water.
[121:51.57]I just got here.
[121:52.51]Hey, and in a few minutes, we will continue.
[121:59.79]I like the stream where you went delirious and ate a whole pizza.
[122:06.36]I mean, I just ate a pizza.
[122:09.64]Alright, I'll see you in a few minutes.
[122:12.08]You should see ads here in a sec.
[122:15.02]Here we go.
[125:40.48]Okay.
[125:43.76]How are you?
[125:45.10]Welcome back.
[125:46.30]I am back.
[125:48.12]Add some water.
[125:49.56]Move my legs around a little bit and I am good to go.
[125:58.69]You have the webcam, but it'd have to be a pixel on the screen.
[126:05.13]Ban that person.
[126:08.81]for an entire... an entire month.
[126:13.11]I don't know.
[126:13.71]I'm angry at him.
[126:15.76]Okay, what are we doing?
[126:17.88]Do I have enough money to buy anything else?
[126:27.33]I think it's worth getting this.
[126:33.13]Yeah, it is.
[126:43.27]Okay, so I have more money.
[126:46.71]Getting more money.
[126:47.25]That's good.
[126:58.62]Is this the only thing you're going to be playing tonight?
[127:00.26]Um, I don't know.
[127:03.63]I'm kind of just feeling this.
[127:04.55]I mean, it's just fun.
[127:06.55]I'm into it.
[127:12.63]I don't really got a plan.
[127:13.35]I just knew I was going to turn it on, so.
[127:18.11]And I think this is a goaded game as the young people of America say.
[127:31.04]You missed a crate?
[127:32.44]Um... No, that's not... My name's not Mr. Crate, actually.
[127:38.02]It's Jeremy, but...
[127:44.50]So I don't know where you got that from.
[127:47.82]But it's not correct.
[127:53.04]Get it.
[128:02.02]Alright, I got this run right here.
[128:03.92]It is a 100% guarantee I'm going to get to at least level 14.
[128:07.00]Alright.
[128:12.57]Go ahead and get the prediction up if you want.
[128:14.86]Level 14.
[128:19.72]I'm going to keep my mouth shut.
[128:20.46]I'm just going to play.
[128:32.01]The doubters are going to eat good.
[128:33.51]No, they're not.
[128:34.49]Be careful.
[128:36.87]All I'm saying is be careful.
[128:43.47]God, please don't bet against me.
[128:47.61]That's a pretty bullet.
[128:49.61]Looks cool looking.
[129:03.46]I'm never going to make it to level 14 if I stay in the corner over here.
[129:07.00]Maybe I will.
[129:08.24]Let's farm here for a minute.
[129:10.20]I got plenty of ammo.
[129:13.57]Let's farm for a minute.
[129:34.72]Believers are going to make a ton of money.
[129:36.10]I'm just saying.
[129:41.84]I gotta make a ton of kettle points.
[129:59.31]Yeah, I'm completely locked in right now.
[130:02.98]So many of you are probably freaking out going, yeah, he's doing the thing where he shuts up and he's playing and he's talking in his kind of just chilled out, regular just voice talking.
[130:12.79]I should have.
[130:13.39]What the fuck, man?
[130:14.40]I wish I could go back.
[130:15.22]I wish I could go back and refund and do it again.
[130:43.79]Moving.
[130:46.63]New spot.
[130:47.67]Need a new crate.
[130:59.14]New crate.
[130:59.96]Need a new crate.
[131:03.89]Who told you you were good at video games?
[131:06.09]I beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[131:11.47]I know that's been like a joke on this channel for a long time, but come on.
[131:19.97]Yeah, I see how many PlayStation trophies those games have.
[131:24.25]70% of you didn't even get to the fucking Bell Gargoyles.
[131:28.97]Okay.
[131:32.77]Yeah, when I open up Elden Ring and I see that like 65% of people haven't even seen Margit's face, I think that's an accomplishment.
[131:52.01]Alright, hold on.
[131:53.02]Come on, come on, come on.
[131:54.68]Better.
[131:54.97]I gotta be better than this.
[131:55.83]What am I doing?
[132:27.50]doubters are imagine being a doubter right now I'm already halfway there guys I don't think he's gonna do it
[133:06.13]Shit!
[133:12.72]Hey, first heal of the night, who cares?
[133:51.32]Fucking die!
[134:24.54]That was a shit spawn!

[134:50.50]Sprint!
[135:06.13]I gotta move.
[135:18.40]Okay, hold on.
[135:19.14]No, no, no, no.
[135:19.92]I need those.
[135:23.87]I need new crate.
[135:24.73]Just move.
[135:29.93]Fuck.
[135:30.99]Please die.
[135:31.39]Please die.
[135:48.30]I need a crate!
[135:50.18]Now!
[135:54.82]I need a crate!
[136:01.03]No!
[136:08.85]Just survive.
[136:09.35]I'm already at 10.
[136:09.92]Here it is.
[136:12.02]Great.
[136:12.86]Okay, I gotta wrap back around.
[136:14.08]Too much shit here.
[136:18.87]Is that a dead end?
[136:19.89]No.
[136:21.05]Okay, hold on.
[136:23.58]Here we go.
[136:24.96]Wrap around.
[136:25.54]Alright, I'm going to shut the fuck up and play.
[137:44.41]That almost was a complete and total disaster.
[137:46.31]If I was down there for even one more second, that would have been horrible.
[137:50.13]Sprint!
[137:57.94]How come I don't want sprint?
[138:01.04]I hold down shift and she doesn't sprint.
[138:03.10]I'm sprinting!
[138:03.94]Sprint!
[138:05.67]What the fuck?
[138:08.43]Sprint!
[138:10.27]Why is shift not sprinting?
[138:11.61]Oh my god, what the fuck is going on?
[138:20.10]Disaster just struck right there.
[138:21.27]I need a crate right now.
[138:49.39]I'm out of bullets already?
[138:51.53]Oh, shit.
[138:58.47]No, what did I say?
[139:00.07]14?
[139:02.84]GG.
[139:03.44]Sorry, Believers.
[139:04.10]I couldn't do it.
[139:04.66]I tried.
[139:05.66]I'm so sorry, Believers.
[139:06.50]I tried.
[139:06.86]I got to 13.
[139:07.16]I tried.
[139:07.40]Hold on.
[139:07.74]Shh.
[139:22.27]I can't move.
[139:24.97]I can't go anywhere.
[139:26.23]Sorry, I tried.
[139:27.09]I got trapped.
[139:31.33]I got trapped.
[139:32.40]It was 13.
[139:33.46]Oh, come on.
[139:39.40]I got trapped in there.
[139:40.62]There was no way to go.
[139:41.54]I couldn't run.
[139:42.64]When you get hit, it staggers you and you can't move.
[139:45.92]Oh.
[139:49.13]What the hell?
[139:49.95]I really thought I was gonna... When I saw the health pack, I just shut up and I thought I was gonna get it, but then I turn the corner and it's a fucking dead end!
[139:56.15]I had it.
[139:58.19]I'm so sorry, Believers.
[139:59.31]Vote for me again this coming, um, attempt.
[140:04.99]And I'll make it up to you.
[140:06.73]My balls hurt again and I don't think I hit them this time.
[140:10.67]I think I just got excited and I clenched my thighs together.
[140:20.11]Oh, man.
[140:21.07]I thought I was going to do it.
[140:27.64]You're really hard to moderate for?
[140:29.04]Oh, yeah.
[140:32.76]Yeah, this shit gets you, like, timed out.
[140:39.78]I'm the streamer.
[140:40.70]I'm the streamer.
[140:41.34]Okay.
[140:44.09]So, that was pretty intense, wasn't it?
[140:49.26]So make sure you believe in me next time when I when I do this again.
[140:52.58]OK, I want ammo and I want to.
[140:56.46]I'm going to upgrade the sniper.
[140:59.44]Yeah.
[141:05.16]And.
[141:12.62]Wait, this does the Vampire Survivors thing.
[141:16.20]Where everything gets more expensive as you upgrade things.
[141:21.68]So... You have to... Okay, hold on.
[141:26.59]So you can't just buy everything.
[141:41.22]Do I even care about this?
[141:42.20]Give me this back.
[141:47.48]I'm not... I don't care about the melee right now.
[141:49.59]I want... More money?
[141:52.89]Or more... Just more health, I think, straight up.
[142:02.69]Or more ammo.
[142:06.55]Pistols.
[142:07.87]Shotguns.
[142:08.89]With sniper rifles.
[142:12.73]Do money again?
[142:14.69]Yeah.
[142:16.05]Who cares?
[142:16.45]Let's go.
[142:23.04]OK, this bet should be if I can get to 13 again.
[142:31.18]In fact, I'm gonna let you bet now because I don't want anything.
[142:33.01]I don't want to have you put the wrong bet.
[142:38.71]I have no money.
[142:39.61]Why'd you go all in?
[142:48.11]Squeaks is in chat.
[142:49.75]Is Squeaks here?
[142:52.57]Well, that's cool.
[142:54.65]I was in Squeaks' chat like all day yesterday.
[143:03.18]Hey, if Squeaks wants to hang out and watch, you let Squeaks hang out and watch.
[143:06.54]Leave him alone.
[143:17.47]You need much better channel rewards.
[143:21.55]Yeah, I'm... I mean, I... I got a whole dashboard on Twitch that is still giving me tutorials.
[143:29.78]Guys.
[143:31.92]I still have tutorials on Twitch that I haven't done for, like, hype trains and channel points and... I don't even fucking have any of this stuff turned on.
[143:52.54]How about one that shocks you when it's redeemed?
[143:56.08]I'm not doing any of that fucking shit, no.
[143:58.72]That's not even allowed on Twitch, by the way, isn't it?
[144:01.23]I just asked you.
[144:08.67]You know what?
[144:09.09]Hold on.
[144:10.75]Early game.
[144:11.85]I'm just going to sit here early game.
[144:14.75]Turtle right here.
[144:15.47]These things die in two hits anyways.
[144:17.01]Use the shitty ammo.
[144:20.01]And just try to make a little bit of money.
[144:22.55]Then pick up that gun once this is empty.
[144:25.72]Then start using it.
[144:43.06]It'll disappear.
[144:43.82]I think a little indicator appears over it, so I can get it.
[144:48.24]Whatever sentence I was supposed to say.
[144:50.48]Whatever the sentence I'm supposed to be saying right now, just think I said it.
[144:54.30]Let me move my microphone closer.
[144:55.52]There we go.
[144:56.82]That's better.
[144:57.26]Okay.
[144:57.48]Yeah, see?
[145:01.36]There.
[145:08.69]There.
[145:12.62]Now we roll out with the melee, find another chest.
[145:21.69]What's the best console of all time?
[145:24.17]Well, if we're talking sales, we're talking about PlayStation 2 or the Wii.
[145:27.90]If we're talking pure gaming fun, we're talking about... Well, if we're talking family-friendly family fun, we're talking the GameCube.
[145:36.54]If you're talking about just pure video game perfect, perfect video gaming...
[145:45.21]I honestly am going to have to go with the, uh, man, probably the PS4.
[145:51.91]I think the PS4 probably the pure like video gaming, maybe the PlayStation 4.
[146:11.47]No, no, you were supposed to chase the three.
[146:14.01]Wait, why did he add this extra number at the end?
[146:17.08]What did he do that for?
[146:18.26]No.
[146:18.56]Strangle him.
[146:19.42]Somebody strangle him.
[146:28.77]Uh, if you, uh, somebody just said it, if you want my real take, and this is, this is the console that I grew up with.
[146:33.68]Uh, it's the Super Nintendo.
[146:36.66]Super Nintendo had so many just complete and total bangers that the whole console was just immaculate.
[146:42.70]The whole thing, hundreds and hundreds of titles, almost all of them were worth playing.
[146:47.12]All of them.
[146:50.14]There wasn't very many ETs on the Super Nintendo.
[146:53.72]There just wasn't at all.
[146:58.77]It's just, it was a perfect console.
[147:02.86]Chrono Trigger, Donkey Kong Country, Super Mario World.
[147:06.31]Are you kidding me?
[147:06.97]That's one of the best games ever made.
[147:08.31]Nothing's come close.
[147:14.15]home improvement game exactly and that was a good one too especially the part where um where he goes and it's compressed times a million so the audio file is only like 10k so it goes like
[147:42.82]Do they have Bloodborne on the Super Nintendo?
[147:47.13]No, but they had Clock Tower on the Super Nintendo.
[147:52.95]Get out.
[147:55.47]No, you can stay.
[147:56.01]You said Bloodborne.
[147:56.60]You're fine.
[148:13.94]What about Peggle Deluxe?
[148:15.42]That's a good one.
[148:15.94]Alright, let's use the Sniper here for a minute.
[148:26.25]He's going for clearing, that's it.
[148:32.16]I'm going to wait for a little bit of a spawn, and then we're going to make our way to another chest.
[148:35.50]Okay, talk.
[148:36.62]Don't have any downtime ever on your stream.
[148:39.66]Ever.
[148:41.00]Always talking, always making a sound effect.
[148:42.79]At least there's no downtime ever.
[148:54.01]Earthbound was good.
[148:54.65]Yeah, I mean, Earthbound's... Mother 2, right?
[149:11.13]Quickly, quickly, quickly.
[149:12.36]Alright.
[149:14.82]It's in here.
[149:15.32]Let me use the rest of this sniper and I'll get it.
[149:23.21]I am making way more money though, so that's good.
[149:48.52]So far so good.
[149:49.11]I got plenty of heals.
[150:36.59]Range is terrible on this thing, too.
[150:38.85]What a piece of shit.
[150:39.63]Alright, move.
[150:55.03]I need a crate.
[151:08.64]I need a crate.
[151:10.34]There we go.
[151:10.68]Alright, hang out here.
[151:15.54]That's kind of bad too, isn't it?
[151:18.76]Oh, no, this is a good one.
[151:19.80]This is definitely a good one.
[151:42.45]nice alright cool hang out here that's good for the special infected that's what I'm going to call them even though if that's not accurate whatever
[152:10.32]Come on, don't get stuck.
[152:12.04]Just move.
[152:12.36]I got plenty of ammo.
[152:12.96]I got plenty of stuff.
[152:13.54]I'm fine.
[152:13.82]I got full health.
[152:23.53]Perfect.
[152:23.87]Alright.
[152:24.23]Now we just sit here and turtle.
[153:07.68]This thing is disgusting.
[153:19.84]Oh, the chainsaw?
[153:22.46]That's fine.
[153:23.00]Okay.
[153:24.06]Do not do that on that guy.
[153:35.08]Need a chest.
[153:38.52]Alright, now here we go.
[153:44.76]Chill here.
[153:56.24]Oh!
[153:57.66]Oh my God, that could've, that could've, that would've.
[154:00.78]That would've and that could've.
[154:15.69]Good.
[154:16.01]That's good to have.
[154:17.73]Holy smokes.
[154:30.38]Holy shit!
[155:02.45]God, die!
[155:05.24]Die!
[155:05.68]I had a hundred million health!
[155:09.90]This thing's a plus seven.
[155:45.28]I gotta go.
[155:45.78]I have to run.
[155:54.40]Holy shit.
[156:02.98]Ooh, yup.
[156:04.06]Okay.
[156:04.66]I think I... Did I do it?
[156:07.82]I need to get to 14, right?
[156:15.87]Oh my god, what the fuck just happened?
[156:20.98]What just killed me fucking instantly?
[156:23.40]I said make it to 13, right?
[156:31.44]Level 13.
[156:32.40]I did it.
[156:35.90]The bet was for 14?
[156:39.17]You explode?
[156:39.77]I thought there was no friendly fire.
[156:41.13]There's friendly fire?
[156:42.27]I thought there wasn't because the grenades weren't hurting me, were they?
[156:47.28]It was... It was 14?
[156:52.62]Okay, at level... Okay, here's the thing.
[156:54.56]At level 14, shit just explodes.
[157:01.95]I... Did I actually kill myself?
[157:11.13]I didn't... I did not know that you could hurt yourself with explosives.
[157:18.69]damn well the difficulty ramps up at 12 doesn't it alright let's do that's rough I want to believe but I can't and can't believe anymore oh man I thought I thought I was good it just I got everything spawned it just killed me so quickly
[157:48.42]OK, how about?
[157:58.60]Maybe that.
[158:07.12]Yeah.
[158:12.25]And then some ammo increase on.
[158:27.25]Yeah, if it did, if it said 14, did say 14.
[158:31.03]Don't worry, you win them all back right now.
[158:36.10]You're going to win them all back right now.
[158:41.92]Do explosives.
[158:49.13]Hmm.
[159:00.70]but here's the thing when all the people that bet against me every single time they win almost every time but there's that one moment where they're going to slip up and it's going to be like an 80 to 20 ratio and you're going to win 10 times what you lost on your channel points
[159:22.01]They're going to get complacent.
[159:23.23]They're going to get greedy.
[159:24.27]And it's, oh, of course he's not going to do it this time.
[159:26.27]And then they're going to get blown out.
[159:37.69]Okay.
[159:42.25]I wish I had another couple thousand.
[159:49.64]Try to go shotguns.
[159:54.25]I feel like I do the best with the shotguns.
[159:58.79]That boom, boom, boom, boom.
[160:00.69]That one.
[160:01.03]Yeah, I'm going shotguns.
[160:06.64]And if I need to, I can.
[160:07.86]I don't even have, I don't own a shotgun.
[160:17.22]I'll find one.
[160:21.94]Peanut butter sandwich or turkey and cheese?
[160:23.22]I'm a turkey and cheese every time.
[160:24.50]Okay.
[160:38.15]Okay, I'm going to win it with this one.
[160:45.80]Okay.
[160:47.52]Let's go.
[160:52.15]Do you want to do 14 or 13?
[160:56.29]Do 13.
[160:56.47]Do 13.
[160:56.99]Let the doubters really, really put their money where their mouth is here.
[161:01.09]Because I've gotten to 13 twice now.
[161:03.46]Do 13.
[161:03.66]I'm going to fuck up.
[161:05.72]I'm going to screw it up.
[161:06.48]I'm going to mess it all up.
[161:07.22]I'm going to die in the first 10 minutes.
[161:08.80]Alright.
[161:18.67]Locking in.
[161:19.53]We're good.
[161:26.10]I'm just gonna sit here.
[161:40.71]Yeah, no more questions, no more answers for the next 10 to 20 straight minutes for one of how long a round goes.
[161:48.81]I'm not going to debate whether an Uncrustable is a sandwich or not, which it isn't.
[161:55.23]It's a pastry.
[161:57.51]You idiot.
[161:59.45]What am I doing?
[162:00.10]Okay.
[162:14.50]This is going to run out of battery.
[162:18.12]Do I do double heal?
[162:19.02]Yeah, I'll just be safe.
[162:27.01]I need to find a shotgun though.
[162:29.27]And that shotgun is not going to be fired until the last when I get to level 10.
[162:47.92]where he can play a little bit of aggressively here he's got two slots full of health packs which allows him to take some hits early if he wants to at least try to generate some more income looks like the other plays we have going on right now they don't have health packs though
[163:31.97]I mean, I can talk to her in the first three of them.
[163:34.21]This is impossible to lose here.
[163:42.11]The only way this would be possible to lose if all of a sudden I got like a charley horse in my foot and I started going, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I can't move.
[163:51.28]Those are the worst.
[163:51.98]Have you ever had a charley horse before?
[163:54.88]Hey, Chad.
[164:17.84]They actually do suck.
[164:18.62]Yeah, they're horrible.
[164:31.91]Alright, time to move.
[165:02.11]I'm gonna have to use it.
[165:41.89]Alright, get the fuck out of here.
[166:14.01]I need something better than this.
[166:14.87]I'm going to run out of ammo.
[166:29.45]Salted beef bagel or tickling?
[166:32.85]What is a chickle?
[167:17.28]good shape alright I'm gonna sit here I'm gonna no let's move so
[167:54.51]That's not good.
[167:55.09]Should have sold it.
[167:56.84]Fuck.
[168:13.87]I'm gonna hang out here for a while.
[168:14.77]There's two crates.
[168:48.35]Dude!
[168:49.67]How am I fucking health?
[168:57.44]Ow!
[168:57.60]Ow!
[170:09.88]That extra shotgun damage.
[170:11.48]Oh!
[170:13.00]Shepskis!
[170:32.87]New area.
[170:39.67]I got three heals.
[170:41.49]Don't have a lot of bullets though.
[170:42.51]I need to really pay attention.
[170:52.74]Oh fuck.
[170:57.29]Give it me.
[170:58.23]Oh yeah.
[170:59.49]Save that.
[171:14.32]What the fuck was that?
[171:33.24]I'm alright for now.
[171:33.86]I could use another crate though.
[171:37.50]Shit, shouldn't have blown that up.
[172:24.06]I need a crate.
[172:29.24]You fucking asshole.
[173:06.72]I'll get to 14 here too.
[173:21.64]Check this out.
[173:36.33]Dude, what is up with fucking level 13?
[173:38.03]It's just like, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[173:44.84]When you get to level 14, they just spawn everywhere.
[173:48.28]Okay, well, I did it.
[173:49.40]You got your points back.
[173:51.37]Those of you that lost everything and you had 10 points left, hey, I just made you like 30 more points.
[174:01.71]You had 10,000.
[174:08.38]Okay, I need more damage now.
[174:10.00]I need more damage.
[174:14.39]Look at that.
[174:16.35]Now it's at 30%.
[174:28.84]I am slightly less disappointed.
[174:30.94]And then I saw you did the slay emote, so that must mean you're happy.
[174:43.16]Mr. Disco.
[174:43.90]We'll use Mr. Disco.
[174:49.12]I haven't upgraded any weapons.
[174:50.86]I've just been a perk guy.
[174:59.75]Should I just refund this and upgrade a weapon?
[175:14.86]Okay, I need to get a good weapon, like a shotgun or something to start with.
[175:20.18]Or even just the sniper.
[175:21.26]I like this thing.
[175:22.04]I'm doing it.
[175:24.94]Sniper is really good for collaterals early.
[175:31.96]Get them during the run.
[175:33.34]Yeah, but you never really see a +2, plus or plus three, plus four, plus sniper rifle.
[175:43.32]Oh, how much do I hate this?
[175:44.68]I don't, I don't hate it.
[175:46.34]Alright, let's go.
[175:58.93]Does the skull thing set to the level you're at?
[176:01.87]Um, I think I just completely misread what you said.
[176:08.05]Wait, what is this?
[176:11.72]Oh, you can start hard?
[176:17.14]Wait a minute.
[176:22.36]Difficulty level accelerates at 50.
[176:25.22]What does this mean?
[176:25.78]Oh, okay.
[176:31.24]So the more shit that you kill, the higher you can actually start.
[176:38.42]That's alright.
[176:38.90]That's actually pretty good.
[176:39.84]That's cool.
[176:41.60]Do you get more points for doing this?
[176:47.79]But what about the vote?
[176:52.79]I still don't think I'm going to make it to 14.
[176:56.67]This is more money.
[177:01.07]It accelerates.
[177:02.47]Oh, OK.
[177:04.33]So the skulls increase 50% faster.
[177:09.13]It's essentially turbo mode.
[177:14.41]Refund the poll.
[177:15.07]Alright, so refund the poll because I'm going to do this.
[177:23.25]Let's do 50% faster and this is going to be a mistake.
[177:25.65]I'm going to go back.
[177:30.23]because then now I do you want to do you think I'll get to level 14 like this there you go that because that was the original bet was like back here with not acceleration so you can you can make your decision if you would like to bet yeah I'll give it a minute we're also coming up on an hour here so I will I will pause
[178:00.29]Just speeds up the waves.
[178:01.27]I think it, yeah, I think it just speeds up, but that's kind of difficult though.
[178:03.51]That's not easy.
[178:05.04]Alright.
[178:06.06]Well, let's, let's see what happens.
[178:14.96]You believe?
[178:17.30]It actually might be easier with just mayhem because if stuff spawns much faster, maybe I could kill things much faster.
[178:26.64]Alright.
[178:27.92]Uh, here I go.
[178:28.72]I'm going to, I am going to have to pause here at about two or three minutes.
[178:41.92]Put on cheers to you.
[178:45.19]Somebody just put it, somebody just did a 1.9 million channel bet.
[178:49.47]What?
[178:53.17]That's more points than I think the whole chat has combined.
[179:00.45]You're going to lose everything.
[179:03.63]This is definitely way harder, by the way.
[179:05.39]They're already coming out fast.
[179:06.67]Let's use it to our advantage.
[179:23.28]We're already going.
[179:24.40]Oh my God.
[179:40.11]That's cool that you can do that, though, because if you do end up playing well and you don't really care about the first two or three, four, five waves, I'm imagining this keeps going to level 50 or something.
[179:51.34]Instead of red skulls, it'll be like orange skulls or something.
[179:54.81]This game must get crazy.
[180:29.37]What is it to get to level 14?
[180:57.65]Now you know what?
[180:58.69]Let's snooze the ad break when it comes up here.
[181:00.35]Because I want the integrity of the run to stay here.
[181:12.12]Perfect lineup.
[181:29.37]Actually, I kind of like it better like this.
[181:50.63]Gotta move soon here.
[181:56.97]I gotta go.
[181:58.92]One more.
[181:59.34]Uh-oh.
[182:05.09]That's a lot of money.
[182:15.18]Okay, move, move, move, move, move.
[182:17.82]Is it dead end?
[182:18.38]Yikes.
[182:27.43]Oh, that was bad.
[182:28.69]Oh my god, that was bad.
[182:29.63]I got fucking destroyed.
[182:33.39]Oh, that was bad.
[182:33.99]Holy shit.
[182:39.45]That was... I just... If one of them just grabbed me and that's it.
[182:43.22]I just... I knew I shouldn't have run down there.
[182:47.46]Fuck.
[182:51.32]Oh, man.
[182:57.54]Oh.
[183:07.55]Minus 1 million coins.
[183:10.65]Dude, I. Here's the problem.
[183:15.15]It's this fucking dog shit right here.
[183:18.59]This I would I would be raging right now.
[183:23.28]If you get grabbed by... If one of them hits you, you go like, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, then you ramp it back up.
[183:34.08]That spawn was awful.
[183:35.96]Go back and see what happened.
[183:36.96]That was absolute shit.
[183:39.10]I walk down that hall.
[183:40.18]Nothing is near me.
[183:44.98]Nothing was near me.
[183:46.44]And then out from the graves come 15 enemies right next to me.
[184:07.77]And you have to throw the health back on the ground.
[184:10.11]It's like its own projectile.
[184:11.59]I fucked up.
[184:13.48]Let's just put it that way.
[184:15.14]The problem is I wasn't playing as a gothic girl.
[184:20.12]I just fixed everything.
[184:29.37]What was I thinking?
[184:30.05]That was the dumbest thing I could have ever done.
[184:36.15]I feel like this needs to be changed a little.
[184:39.16]But, or I just don't walk down a hallway when it don't have any confidence in this game ever.
[184:44.18]Maybe I'm going to take a piece of the regen.
[184:52.04]It's got to go somewhere else.
[185:13.18]It's I gotta get rid of some of this junk.
[185:18.92]Yeah, because it.
[185:21.06]It is so awful.
[185:22.04]OK, I got a 520 alright.
[185:27.47]Alright, let's take a break.
[185:32.93]I'll be back in.
[185:35.67]Bring back granny.
[185:37.89]If I don't do this with the golf girl, then I will change to granny.
[185:46.53]Throw a bet on the break.
[185:47.63]I will keep it at the same crazy level here.
[185:52.97]So we'll do 1.5 and we'll start here.
[185:55.45]Yeah.
[185:56.15]Okay.
[185:56.65]If you want to bet, if you think I can get to level 14 or not, go for it.
[186:00.79]I'll be back in... I think about four or five minutes.
[186:12.00]Okay.
[186:16.85]Free points TL;DR free points on no.
[186:23.46]I feel so bad that person put like a million points in or something or was like 100 something thousand.
[186:31.65]I thought I was going to do it too.
[186:32.69]Hey, it's all good.
[186:36.21]I'll be right back.
[190:45.11]Just making a coffee.
[190:47.52]Sorry if I scared you.
[190:49.98]I just feel like a coffee, you know?
[190:52.94]A nightcap night coffee.
[190:56.25]Sounds pretty damn good.
[190:58.29]Be right back.
[191:33.06]little late for coffee yeah but if you do a so I I you can set it and do a light roast I just kind of felt like one hey every time I go to an italian restaurant they it's like do you want a cappuccino after the meal like yeah I kind of do
[191:57.68]You're not sleeping tonight.
[192:00.53]It's just a little.
[192:01.25]It's not a lot, just a little bit.
[192:05.79]Somebody said what strain is the coffee you're drinking.
[192:11.59]Um?
[192:13.63]I'm drinking like indica coffee.
[192:19.90]Light roast is worse.
[192:20.84]I I know I know I know.
[192:22.20]I said that wrong.
[192:28.11]It's funny because I actually caffeine really does affect me so.
[192:32.50]I know that.
[192:32.86]There's a lot of people, especially ADHD, where it does the reverse.
[192:39.60]I'm not one of those people.
[192:41.38]Caffeine affects me a lot so.
[192:46.01]Origin of the beans.
[192:47.33]It's Pete's coffee.
[192:49.59]It's coffee medium called Big Bang.
[192:52.27]I've been drinking it for a long time now.
[193:01.45]It's pretty good, but it's stupid expensive.
[193:03.31]Wait, what is it?
[193:04.65]Josh, what did you just say?
[193:08.09]Kona is pretty good, but it's stupid expensive because it's only grown in the mountains of Hawaii.
[193:14.73]I would try it.
[193:15.13]That sounds good.
[193:15.57]Alright, let's go for it, huh?
[193:24.87]I was thinking about making a tea, but coffee just sounded correct.
[193:33.37]Oh yeah, oof.
[193:36.27]Oh, now that's burnt.
[193:38.83]That's burnt.
[193:39.53]OK, never mind.
[193:40.23]Let's dump that.
[193:42.71]No, that's good.
[193:44.85]That's good stuff.
[193:50.26]Did you make your bets yet?
[193:58.24]You have a big sip.
[193:58.84]I just did.
[194:02.83]Don't go plep, plep, plep.
[194:09.66]That was... I... I... I hate microphones.
[194:12.42]Alright, I'm locking in.
[194:16.63]This is the one.
[194:18.95]I just took a sip of coffee so you know how it's over.
[194:22.35]It's over for the doubters.
[194:23.63]Look at that.
[194:24.01]Perfect placement.
[194:24.79]The end of the bat was right in his head.
[194:27.25]Perfect.
[194:28.27]W-A-D.
[194:28.91]W-W-W-A-D.
[194:29.79]Perfect.
[194:30.11]You see that?
[194:30.49]Look at that.
[194:31.61]Perfect.
[194:32.07]W-A-D.
[194:32.59]W-W-W-A-S-D.
[194:33.58]W-A-D.
[194:35.04]That one point of damage was intentional.
[195:05.03]early stream.
[195:07.55]This is a late stream.
[195:08.63]I've been streaming a lot later recently.
[195:13.04]I like the vibe of the night time. ...
[195:42.29]I gotta roll out here.
[195:43.13]Oh my goodness.
[195:50.43]What the fuck was that?
[196:00.36]Finally.
[196:00.78]Wait.
[196:00.88]Oh.
[196:01.28]Wait.
[196:04.96]A melee weapon that has the same damage as the one I have.
[196:11.37]Oh.
[196:11.91]Wait.
[196:22.23]That shit RNG.
[196:23.80]This one might be bad.
[196:45.22]So am I going to hurt myself with this thing?
[196:47.04]These are dangerous.
[196:47.73]I shouldn't have these.
[196:50.29]Still not good enough.
[196:51.02]I need way more ammo than this.
[197:20.56]Okay, there is no friendly fire.
[197:21.68]I would have just died.
[197:27.42]Another rocket launcher.
[197:28.53]I don't want a rocket launcher.
[197:29.59]I want a shotgun.
[197:31.41]Ooh, actually.
[197:32.19]Get out of here, please.
[197:55.79]Wow.
[198:32.92]Give me that money.
[198:36.78]Good.
[198:38.58]Good.
[198:38.88]Give it up.
[198:49.59]Barrel, I'm going to use it.
[198:50.69]Hang out here.
[198:51.15]What a waste.
[198:56.57]We're good.
[199:01.22]This thing has so much ammo in it.
[199:02.68]I need this gun.
[199:05.95]This thing is saving the whole run right now.
[199:28.74]Good.
[199:30.94]Yes!
[200:30.32]Dude, level 14 is impossible.
[200:35.05]Wait, I made it to level 14.
[200:35.99]Does that count?
[200:37.37]Wait, what was it?
[200:38.23]I got to 14.
[200:38.57]I won.
[200:51.44]I went in there because I, okay, here's my thought process.
[200:56.21]I had 10 shots left of the gun and I had shot that guy behind the grate with like a hundred bullets.
[201:04.81]In my mind, I was like, this guy, they usually drop a gun.
[201:08.59]And I was like, they're spawning all over here now.
[201:11.27]I got to take my chances to shoot this guy with the sniper rifle five to 10 times and get the gun and then unload.
[201:19.93]Two RPGs and 10 shots from a green gun.
[201:22.07]Yeah, that guy had a lot of health.
[201:25.66]I made it though.
[201:32.22]That was so funny because...
[201:36.93]When I died, all the people that bet big on me getting to 14, all were like, you fucking suck.
[201:44.00]What the fuck, dude?
[201:45.46]I can't believe what you did.
[201:46.90]And then they realized that they had won.
[201:48.90]And it immediately turned into like, claps, clap.
[201:53.85]Whoa, he did it.
[201:55.09]Oh, yay.
[201:55.85]Oh, hooray.
[201:56.75]Oh, we love this guy.
[202:10.65]This game's fun.
[202:11.61]It's hard though.
[202:14.65]I gotta get past the 14 wall though.
[202:17.17]It's just too huge.
[202:21.73]I need more damage.
[202:22.93]I got 7,000.
[202:23.81]What can I do?
[202:31.28]I gotta get some damage on something here.
[202:33.78]I'm gonna do damage on the sniper.
[202:35.60]I've been using it all the time.
[202:39.89]That's 50% more damage.
[202:41.61]I use it a lot.
[202:42.47]That's my weapon of choice right now.
[202:52.44]Or 2% ammo sounds like nothing.
[202:56.49]100 rounds, that's two bullets.
[202:58.63]That's terrible.
[203:04.69]I guess eventually you maybe get more.
[203:11.64]it's all weapons yeah but even still I feel like that's that's not very good I'm cool with this for now you have any tips for beating um the DLC elderly DLC boss final boss yeah uh go get the thumb shield and a regular spear
[203:39.54]and put like a hundred points in endurance and hold the shield up the whole time and you will not her get hurt and you can stab while while you hold that have the shield up you can stab uh and we thought me and Ster talked about this before but it's really really funny when you're up against the final boss of the DLC oh my god I can't believe it
[204:05.05]Radan!
[204:05.63]There he is!
[204:06.09]He's so powerful!
[204:06.89]This is a god, by the way.
[204:08.21]He's a god!
[204:09.61]He's flying among the cosmos.
[204:11.18]It's a double god.
[204:13.52]And it's just this one naked asshole with a big slab of concrete is enough to beat that.
[204:20.60]Like a naked guy with a big chunk of concrete.
[204:23.46]And it's like an evil piece of concrete.
[204:27.33]It's the fingerprint shield.
[204:32.41]This is a fucking evil slab of concrete.
[204:38.69]I love that so much.
[204:45.00]Alright, lock in.
[205:05.70]Save the sniper.
[205:08.22]The one thing that's beefed up.
[205:21.47]Yeah, I'm definitely a sniper.
[205:24.13]Yeah, you know what I mean?
[205:27.93]I have so much patience, and I'm willing to lock in for sometimes a month at a time to get my kill.
[205:34.20]That's definitely me.
[205:35.64]Alright, what weapon do you think I am?
[205:40.84]We all know what's... You all said I'm C-3PO from Star Wars, but what weapon am I?
[205:47.15]Like a... What kind of... What kind of gun or explosive or...
[206:12.19]somebody said a plunger that one uh that one doesn't count okay don't bet anymore on me I'm I'm I failed a plunger
[206:30.98]Okay, but can I be... Okay, I would agree with you if... Can I not be the plunger?
[206:36.81]Can I be the whole package of the goofy weapon that shoots the plunger with a string on it?
[206:43.55]But like... Zipline gun?
[206:56.06]Yeah, but it's a plunger.
[207:02.08]The plunger would be enhanced with arcane.
[207:12.96]You'd be a shitty scorpion spear.
[207:17.15]Scorpions are one of the most interesting, dangerous, mysterious animals on Earth.
[207:24.05]So that's fine.
[207:35.97]Okay, no more messing around.
[207:42.34]When I played Demon's Souls, one of my favorite things that Demon's Souls was doing... The Demon's Souls remake does this thing, and I think it's in the original too, but it looks... I love the way it looks in the remake.
[207:52.75]The remake is such a... It's like the most beautiful game that's ever released.
[207:57.03]If you play Demon's Souls on PS5 and you put on like HDR and you put it on an OLED, it's like, oh my God, this is fucking gorgeous.
[208:05.25]It's like one of the most beautiful fucking games ever.
[208:09.05]There's a poison move where the character puts their arm down and does it like an evil spell.
[208:16.75]It's like, here comes the evilness from below.
[208:19.35]I love it.
[208:20.33]It's like one of my favorite animations for a spellcast.
[208:23.99]His hand kind of shakes and curdles a little.
[208:26.13]It looks very, very evil.
[208:29.22]And it's how you cast the Poison Cloud spell.
[208:31.24]I love it.
[208:31.60]It's so great.
[208:37.63]Alright, let's walk in.
[208:51.70]Don't shoot that because I want it.
[208:58.20]Can you please play that?
[209:00.36]That'd be fun, wouldn't it?
[209:13.59]I love that game.
[209:19.84]Hey, fun fact to all you new viewers of this channel.
[209:27.58]That is the first FromSoftware game that I think I streamed.
[209:31.11]It was either that or Dark Souls 3.
[209:34.61]No, it was definitely Demon.
[209:35.49]It was the original Demon's Souls, wasn't it?
[209:36.75]That was the first FromSoftware game I streamed.
[209:39.86]I think.
[209:49.21]How much further past Dark Souls 3 did I play Demon's Souls?
[209:52.84]Because I played the one on the PlayStation 3.
[209:54.40]I played the original one.
[209:59.18]Still haven't streamed Bloodborne?
[210:00.36]I know.
[210:01.89]That's one of my favorite games ever made.
[210:03.73]I got a pretty extensive list now.
[210:07.45]I've realized this.
[210:08.41]I have a pretty long list now of favorite games ever.
[210:11.35]It's like probably 10 to 20 long now.
[210:12.79]You keep hearing me say them.
[210:22.28]Gotta move.
[210:26.79]Don't get... Don't take... I'm taking the bait.
[210:34.40]Why did I take the bait?
[210:35.22]I told you.
[210:35.75]Why did I do this?
[210:55.55]That's not great, but it's better than nothing.
[211:26.75]Actually, plus six is good.
[211:27.91]Alright, lock in.
[211:41.94]Gotta move.
[211:46.15]Got a blast.
[211:48.01]Jammy, jammy Neutron.
[214:09.01]Jammy Neutron, I beat you.
[214:11.64]I beat you.
[214:12.80]Why am I treating you like a villain that I just beat?
[214:16.22]I don't know.
[214:18.46]I beat you.
[214:25.85]That's quite the first reaction to winning.
[214:31.23]I do not do enough damage to get further than this, though.
[214:33.82]I'm just going to collect money.
[214:34.74]I'm in trouble.
[214:39.65]Holy shit, I can't even hurt anything now.
[214:48.69]Yikes, come on.
[214:49.63]I need money.
[214:52.55]Only 12,000.
[214:52.75]It's like $100 per kill now.
[215:08.60]oh no I'm in trouble that's it oh there it is I should have got the barrel yeah it's okay level 16. that's that's pretty good got some money to work with now
[215:36.84]I kind of want to keep upgrading the sniper.
[215:39.30]But that's probably stupid.
[215:45.99]Some more straight up damage.
[215:47.17]Oh no.
[215:49.57]Oh, by the way.
[215:51.61]I'm... When you refund, you get all the money back, right?
[215:58.88]Or did I just lose like 10% by doing that?
[216:04.12]It looks like I'm getting all the money back, right?
[216:11.82]Okay, cool.
[216:13.46]I can't imagine there's anything better than either this or this.
[216:19.72]Snipers don't drop.
[216:20.68]I don't think... Has a sniper even dropped it once the whole time?
[216:23.70]I feel like I've only seen it like once or twice.
[216:34.62]Should be getting ammo.
[216:35.72]Yeah, let's... I'm going for this.
[216:42.20]I wish I had a little bit more money to spend.
[216:47.73]Screw the region.
[216:58.77]Something was spread.
[216:59.53]Yeah, spreads probably like a shotgun or something, but.
[217:02.09]I feel like I need to just have a weapon that I'm just using.
[217:09.56]Use your melee a little bit earlier, yeah?
[217:12.54]What can I do over here with this?
[217:18.74]I could get this up.
[217:22.64]Okay.
[217:22.88]So that's pretty good now.
[217:26.76]Ghost shotgun.
[217:27.40]It's good for crowd control.
[217:28.40]Yeah.
[217:30.44]If the sniper rifle doesn't work out in the next couple of rounds.
[217:33.66]I feel like I like using it though.
[217:34.64]It's fun.
[217:40.93]This is good too.
[217:44.95]Maybe put this instead of the... Where's like a regular just shotgun?
[217:54.54]This thing here.
[217:55.14]There we go.
[218:04.49]Okay.
[218:05.35]I think that's a good start.
[218:09.59]That's a lot more ammo too.
[218:10.91]Good.
[218:20.94]The SMGs suck in this game.
[218:22.12]Alright, I gotta utilize the melee way more.
[218:29.43]Actually, I gotta do the melee money thing too.
[218:31.33]There's so many upgrades in this game.
[218:42.89]I know I'm gonna miss that regen.
[218:51.34]If you were threatened by a zombie, would you just use a screaming?
[218:54.04]Would you scream at a high frequency to kill it?
[218:59.75]No, I would show it.
[219:00.59]I would do a magic trick in front of it.
[219:02.75]I take out a bunch of coins and I'd be like, let me see your hand.
[219:05.55]See this coin?
[219:06.53]That's a silver dollar right there.
[219:08.63]Now watch this.
[219:09.59]And the zombie would be like, if I put it in this hand and then I throw it in the air and then I just start sprinting.
[219:20.23]That's how I would get out of most situations, by the way.
[219:25.67]Give me all your money!
[219:27.37]Oh, well, hold on now a second there.
[219:30.89]Some money?
[219:32.07]I've got a handful of change here.
[219:33.15]I want to show you a quick little trick.
[219:34.74]I'm going to make this coin disappear.
[219:38.98]And it might even appear behind your ear.
[219:48.50]I'm going to get trapped in there.
[220:19.44]That's when I would do the two or three back handsprings.
[220:27.49]One, two, three, four.
[220:29.34]And then I would throw down a... I would throw down a... Hold on, I don't want to die.
[220:50.32]Oh, that's just better.
[220:53.65]Save that.
[220:56.94]Is this the only environment in the game?
[220:58.14]I think it's just... I think it's just a challenge game.
[221:02.81]Where it just gets harder and harder and harder and harder and just more... It's just sort of a... Grind out levels and shoot stuff.
[221:13.14]but I like that though I think it's fine they might have it's possible they might have more content later I don't know more maps would be nice yeah more maps and maybe a maybe boss I don't even they might be a boss in the game I'm not sure I think a couple more maps and hold on and maybe a few hard boss encounters be kind of fun
[221:38.24]As it stands right now, this is just a fun game just to kind of hang out and just talk and stuff.
[221:43.44]But I figured it was going to be so.
[221:45.90]Exactly what I'm getting out of it.
[221:50.32]Okay, I got to pay attention now.
[221:59.64]Objectives for the co-op mode.
[222:03.20]There's a lot of cool things to be able to add to this.
[222:05.40]I mean, it just came out, so I imagine... I don't know what the original was like.
[222:09.46]The original might have been just like this because this is kind of a remake of that one.
[222:26.32]Oh, I knew that was going to happen.
[222:35.36]I gotta move.
[222:40.42]The original was 2D and it was on the 3DS.
[222:45.94]We're seeing a... Sorry about that weird squeaking sound I just made.
[222:50.29]We're seeing a lot of old Flash games and old sort of games that were really fun get re... remade.
[223:02.88]I actually don't mind these kind of remakes because number one, it introduces a game like this to a whole new audience that maybe didn't play it on like an old 3DS.
[223:15.87]But I am of the opinion that a lot of these developers that made these really, really fun experiences
[223:26.86]It's possible they didn't make that much money.
[223:29.96]You know?
[223:30.50]Like, it's possible that, oh, I made this Flash game, or I did this thing, and I got the... It's possible that it was... Didn't really... It's really old, didn't make a bunch of money, maybe.
[223:40.55]Maybe they made it for fun.
[223:42.31]And they're beloved.
[223:43.27]People think they're like, that's one of the best games I've ever played.
[223:47.02]So introducing it to a new audience and letting the developer make some, hopefully some good money out of it, something that we all played a long time ago that genuinely say this is very good.
[223:57.85]I like that.
[224:00.35]I'm for that.
[224:03.73]Some flash devs were making bank.
[224:05.74]Yeah, it was possible.
[224:09.65]But ad revenue and the monetization of the internet didn't really start for quite a while, actually.
[224:19.83]I need some new stuff here.
[224:41.42]banner ads I I that's true but I don't know how well those were paying guys I don't think the like 1999 like 2002 banner ads for some random like fucking porn game was paying a massive fucking dollar bills
[225:12.74]Hold on, I need, I gotta, I gotta get something here.
[225:15.07]Um, this is the first I've been.
[225:23.91]You get millions it adds up.
[225:25.89]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[225:26.91]I, I gotta be, I've, you're distracting me because you're, you bet it against me.
[225:33.72]I need a crate right now.
[225:42.07]Give me a crate, please.
[225:43.93]Oh, that's a terrible spot.
[225:49.30]I have to skip it.
[225:53.16]I think I made it though.
[225:54.26]Did I make it?
[226:00.25]Oh, please.
[226:01.89]No.
[226:02.91]They always have to spawn them right when I get over there.
[226:09.19]It's a grenade.
[226:09.73]Fuck, they're not that good.
[226:12.09]I guess they're kind of good.
[226:25.71]I need to start making some money.
[226:31.06]Come on.
[226:31.58]Displacement.
[226:42.33]There we go.
[226:51.76]Did not blow that up yet.
[226:52.88]I need it.
[226:55.74]And... Blow it up!
[227:10.77]Damn, I'm almost at level 20.
[227:13.13]I need weapons.
[227:14.01]I don't have anything.
[227:17.37]Oh, that's the end.
[227:19.13]That's going to be it.
[227:19.85]Unless there's something crazy in this.
[227:23.81]That's kind of crazy.
[227:36.98]This guy's got so much health.
[227:38.44]Are you shitting me?
[227:57.33]I need to get some of this money.
[228:00.73]I need that money.
[228:01.23]I don't care if I die.
[228:02.22]I need the money.
[228:02.82]I needed it bad.
[228:06.70]Hey, 19.
[228:13.58]Running is cheating?
[228:16.34]What?
[228:18.79]Hey, I didn't.
[228:19.59]I already beat it by the time I was running.
[228:25.13]Alright.
[228:25.93]That seemed to work out.
[228:36.96]I kind of feel like I have to do this.
[228:38.12]I feel like it's mandatory.
[228:41.68]Increasing infection speed makes it easier to get past 15.
[228:43.80]Yeah, but also makes it harder to.
[228:55.36]Also, I want to make a statement here.
[228:58.38]That was 304 believes in a row.
[229:04.06]See what I told you an hour ago, two hours ago?
[229:07.07]All the doubters that think that they're so smart.
[229:13.91]I tried to tell you, I tried to warn you.
[229:21.14]Melee kills cause extra money to drop increased by 25% per rank.
[229:24.94]So you can only do this every 20 seconds.
[229:42.79]That's good too.
[229:43.45]I could just do even just more damage.
[229:53.51]The zombie apocalypse broke out.
[229:55.53]Would you rather immediately kill your zombie neighbors or would you try to become the main character of the story and find the antidote?
[230:03.12]I'd want to be in the contact list of the person's phone that finds the antidote.
[230:13.32]And I am going to.
[230:16.06]I don't know.
[230:21.77]That's really lazy.
[230:27.07]I think this is important though.
[230:32.33]It just is.
[230:32.79]I should be.
[230:37.72]I should get this to Max.
[230:41.06]Because you can always have a melee weapon on you.
[230:43.66]In fact, I'm probably going to pull back from this.
[230:50.58]Because always having melee is just perfect.
[230:53.97]And then I can probably upgrade that one more time, right?
[230:56.25]Yep.
[230:57.71]Okay.
[231:07.83]Pretty good.
[231:15.62]Hey, Jeremiah, can I ask you a favor?
[231:16.55]My dad got into your streams around Dollhouse.
[231:18.27]Oh, that got deleted.
[231:24.21]It started out kind of wholesome.
[231:26.57]It was just not.
[231:27.71]Okay.
[231:33.13]Alright.
[231:34.36]Well, let's see how much more damage this does now.
[231:42.66]That's the one hit kill on those.
[231:45.00]The white ones is kind of crazy.
[231:59.70]Damn.
[232:00.03]Alright.
[232:00.51]Maybe we're going all in on melee because this is going much better.
[232:03.87]What's in here?
[232:10.31]Ah, okay.
[232:31.58]I would agree with you, but I switched to Goth Girl and my high score has been ever increasing ever since.
[232:38.50]So until Goth Girl has a bad round, which has not happened yet really.
[233:19.86]Hey, what's Squeaks doing tomorrow?
[233:21.10]Tell him I want him to play this.
[233:47.67]The game does this thing where it makes you not want to leave the screen too far because the money will despawn.
[233:55.37]And that's a good, that's an interesting developer tactic to make you not a coward.
[234:02.06]Right?
[234:02.28]Because, oh, I'll just go pick it up later.
[234:03.54]No, you won't.
[234:05.10]If you were two or three screens away, this shit's gone.
[234:14.42]Kind of interesting, isn't it?
[234:20.61]Alright, let's get the melee out and move.
[234:25.39]Although I got pretty good weapons right now.
[234:36.60]You're a video game critic?
[234:39.84]No, I'm not.
[234:44.77]Guys, I'm afraid to say when a game is bad.
[234:50.14]I usually just go... Okay, so what the fuck is the rating?
[234:51.96]You think I'm a critic?
[234:52.70]That was cute.
[235:10.11]Yeah, but that doesn't always mean bad, though.
[235:12.27]Sometimes that does mean that was cute.
[235:15.87]That does not always mean bad.
[235:30.18]Oh, I've got a little temporary lock in here.
[236:01.08]Pistol, that's it?
[236:02.66]What is this shit?
[236:14.63]You know what else I think would probably like this game a lot is turf.
[236:42.27]Der would hate this.
[236:43.51]No, what are you?
[236:46.23]Maybe he would.
[236:46.90]Do I even know any of my friends at all?
[236:49.54]It's a lot of money.
[236:54.88]Alright, I gotta move.
[237:14.54]Come on, I want the glowy guy.
[237:16.62]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[237:18.84]Come on!
[237:20.15]Come on!
[237:23.57]No, you fat fuck, you're in the way!
[237:29.64]No, fuck!
[237:42.79]You piece of fucking shit.
[237:44.39]I had a good gear on this guy.
[237:54.58]He's crashing out.
[237:55.68]No, I'm not crashing out.
[237:56.90]I'm crashing in.
[237:57.64]Oh, what a beautiful fucking explosion that was.
[238:12.61]Don't leave the screen, it's going to get despawned.
[238:15.13]Oh my God, I'm crashing out.
[238:27.81]Why am I saying that now?
[238:37.34]That was rude.
[238:38.80]You know, it was rude, you're right.
[238:42.93]I should have said, you zombie brain-eating fucking weirdo.
[238:58.30]Is that worse?
[239:08.65]He was in the way.
[239:09.43]I couldn't shoot around him.
[239:11.65]I tried to shoot to the left.
[239:13.75]His stomach was over to the left.
[239:15.05]I tried to shoot to the right.
[239:15.85]His stomach was to the right.
[239:18.48]I couldn't shoot around him.
[239:21.72]What am I upgrading here?
[239:22.46]Ooh.
[239:39.16]Cool, I like it.
[239:39.76]You should apologize to him right now.
[239:42.46]Alright, the next time I see him, I will apologize.
[239:44.14]I will apologize to that zombie when I see him next.
[239:49.06]And then I'm going to bash his brains in with this mallet.
[240:00.41]Okay, what am I doing here?
[240:08.86]Is it good to just... Maybe I should do this.
[240:20.59]Yeah, that's true.
[240:21.13]I could actually just not do it.
[240:26.55]I could just save the money.
[240:28.21]Yeah, let's go.
[240:29.78]I'm locking in.
[240:37.61]Would you go whole stream without saying the F word?
[240:39.43]Uh, I could.
[240:41.03]Yeah, probably.
[240:48.54]I'll go this whole round without doing it.
[241:03.73]Gamble on no swears.
[241:05.35]Oh yeah, let's go.
[241:09.08]Let's do a no swear run for sure.
[241:10.70]I could probably do it.
[241:37.32]I'm just imagining somebody in a zombie apocalypse.
[241:42.12]Trying to shoot around a like bigger zombie.
[241:47.60]And getting that annoyed about it.
[241:50.65]Like a big fat zombie and you're just like.
[241:59.67]You better be good.
[242:00.51]I'll be good.
[242:02.86]I'll be good.
[242:03.26]I'll be good.
[242:03.62]I'll be good.
[242:22.92]no swears no I'm okay here I love you where there he is look man I was just really annoyed in the moment and oh he's dead do you think he heard my apology
[243:02.38]Alright, we're good.
[243:26.82]He'll be back in a minute.
[243:27.56]You can apologize then, too.
[243:34.77]That just despawned.
[243:59.34]Come sing with me.
[244:02.18]Come sing with me.
[244:32.96]I don't know.
[244:33.30]I'm just thinking of like the scout line now.
[244:36.13]What does the scout say?
[244:37.01]Like, you bald, you bald bastard.
[244:43.07]He said something.
[244:43.69]What does he say?
[244:49.86]Don't die.
[244:50.86]Oh, does that count?
[244:55.20]No, no, no, no.
[244:55.82]That was a reference.
[244:58.94]No, no, no, no, that's a reference to another line, to a different piece of media.
[245:03.17]Does that count?
[245:03.95]No, it doesn't count, does it?
[245:08.64]That counts?
[245:10.16]Oh, and no, it might.
[245:11.28]Yeah, that probably counts.
[245:12.78]I, oh my god.
[245:27.76]I'm sorry all you all you believers of the me having any self-control at all oh these zombies are bald right I'm just thinking of like voice line the scout just like ran by my screen and he stopped right here and he was like oh like how many heads boink
[246:20.39]Hold on, don't die.
[246:21.73]I gotta run.
[246:38.85]I gotta look at how much money I got.
[246:39.81]This is crazy.
[246:49.63]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[246:55.47]Oh, I got an ad break coming up.
[247:06.86]I'm locked in right now.
[247:07.70]Alright, I got to collect this money.
[247:22.24]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[247:23.94]Don't pick up anything.
[247:24.54]Just get the money.
[247:25.20]Even if I die, it's fine.
[247:25.86]It's okay.
[247:28.28]It's alright.
[247:28.60]It's alright.
[247:28.96]It's alright.
[247:29.88]I got 20,000.
[247:34.46]Bald is a swear.
[247:49.15]Is this better than Resident Evil?
[247:50.33]It's pretty good.
[247:54.57]I think it's pretty good.
[248:01.49]I got a gigantic amount of money now.
[248:19.02]Did you just control C, control V, my joke?
[248:22.14]Wait, are you talking about me or somebody in the chat?
[248:29.45]Don't go me.
[248:30.08]I just read it.
[248:34.54]I think I want this.
[248:43.03]Now somebody in chat did that.
[248:44.41]That's funny.
[249:05.20]860 more zombies and I can unlock this.
[249:09.86]I always want more damage though.
[249:11.08]I feel like I'm not doing enough.
[249:19.20]I know this is probably a bad idea, but.
[249:25.62]I want I need to be counted at region is great, but I want to kill things much faster.
[249:35.21]I'll be doing way more across the board now.
[249:42.20]This is the most popular I've been in 26 years.
[249:44.04]So many chatters are control seeing my jokes.
[250:02.85]You don't melee enough when it gets tough to justify the investment.
[250:06.56]That's true, but I use it.
[250:09.94]Yeah, I use it early.
[250:10.84]I need to use it much later in the mid and late game.
[250:12.96]Alright, I'm gonna take a break.
[250:16.18]We're up at a break here.
[250:19.72]I will be back.
[250:25.39]That was my joke.
[250:27.75]Oh, was that a copypasta?
[250:28.69]Did I read a copypasta?
[250:29.57]You're gonna get some more coffee?
[250:31.69]Um, that's probably not a great idea, but... I'm just having fun.
[250:36.65]I'm just chilling.
[250:51.86]Do a bong rip, then some coffee?
[250:53.48]No, no, god no, that's not a good idea.
[251:00.98]You don't, I don't, you don't mix those two.
[251:09.66]Do it?
[251:10.06]No, no, no, no.
[251:11.42]I don't mix, don't mix that shit.
[251:12.52]I don't want my heart to be fast and my brain to slow down.
[251:16.73]That sounds horrible.
[251:33.24]Alright, I'll be back.
[251:38.64]See you guys in a few minutes.
[251:45.31]BRB?
[252:55.35]I made another coffee.
[252:57.43]In a Peter Griffin voice.
[252:58.23]See you in a minute.
[253:59.18]Ads are playing right now.
[254:00.42]I just sat down with my coffee.
[254:01.48]All the people watching ads, they can't hear this.
[254:07.08]It's just between us.
[254:08.08]You know, it's just between us.
[254:13.61]Think about that.
[254:14.09]Think about the people that aren't hearing this right now.
[254:15.53]This is just between me and you.
[254:16.65]No, it isn't.
[254:27.12]No, it isn't.
[254:28.10]Don't think that way either.
[254:29.34]Not between you and me.
[254:50.00]Parasocial.
[254:50.80]Yeah, I've said this before.
[254:53.00]I don't fucking know you.
[254:54.60]I don't know who the fuck you are.
[254:58.03]This is a collective ant farm.
[255:00.41]That's how I see it.
[255:01.65]We're all ants here.
[255:03.00]We're all in the collective ant farm.
[255:11.16]When the ad break stops, I'll make sure to tell them to.
[255:17.67]And I want them to come back to it mid-sentence.
[255:20.48]Yeah, we're ants.
[255:21.84]We're all ants here.
[255:23.16]And I don't have to even explain that really.
[255:25.69]We're all ants in the ant farm.
[255:27.93]I don't know any of you.
[255:30.47]Come back to that?
[255:30.99]Alright, good.
[255:31.61]Yeah, I don't know any of you.
[255:32.95]We're all ants in the ant farm and that's how I see it.
[255:41.10]I'm the queen ant.
[255:48.12]Oh, we're insects to him.
[255:55.87]No, you should see this community as a large group of ants all collectively in the same hive.
[256:03.53]You don't need to know anybody.
[256:05.17]You don't need to know anybody.
[256:06.47]If you don't know anybody, who fucking cares?
[256:08.26]He's just one of the ants.
[256:09.06]I'm one of the ants in the anthill too.
[256:22.68]Stop calling your viewers insects.
[256:28.69]Oh, so like a cult.
[256:29.63]No.
[256:34.12]Could I be a beetle?
[256:35.22]Yeah, if you want.
[256:36.12]But you, I mean, that's... If you were a McDonald's cashier, what would be your opening line?
[256:49.85]Hello, hello.
[256:50.69]Welcome to McDonald's.
[256:52.51]I hope I'm here to serve every one of your friendly needs.
[256:55.81]We have Super McShakes and we've got Mc... Griddles.
[257:00.79]And they're fresh off the grill and I could make it for you fresh personally.
[257:07.84]We got McGriddles.
[257:08.90]We've got Mc... What else?
[257:11.04]McCafe.
[257:12.94]Fuck, don't leave.
[257:25.29]every mcriddle is personalized yeah that's right alright let's keep going he doesn't even know what to serve that's a parasocial cashier yeah that's true
[257:50.70]A McPickle?
[257:53.34]Wait, hold on.
[257:54.14]That person says I'm crazy.
[257:55.30]A McPickle Pounder?
[257:58.78]What's a McPickle Pounder?
[258:00.32]That sounds like it could be real.
[258:06.63]I feel like if you ate two McPickle Pounders, both of your ass cheeks, you would just turn into, both your ass cheeks just inflate.
[258:20.33]Hey, guys, I've got a fat enough ass already.
[258:22.36]I don't need a McPickle pounder.
[258:41.15]I just, okay, walked in.
[258:42.15]That was a screen door that I didn't realize was not there, and I walked into it.
[258:47.85]You know what I mean?
[258:50.10]That was it.
[258:50.62]That was a screen door.
[258:51.52]I'm like a Labrador retriever thinking that the glass is open and I just ran into it.
[259:02.41]No, my ass is fat enough already.
[259:04.09]I don't need any more fucking McDonald's.
[259:34.37]I just told you we're all in like the ant hive.
[259:36.93]Excuse me.
[259:53.53]Ant Colony, Ant Borough, what do you call it?

[260:25.69]It's still in here.
[260:26.79]I keep thinking about it.
[260:31.63]I'm just imagining somebody typing that and just hitting enter.
[260:38.22]Were you smiling when you did you have a big smirk on your face when you make a pickle powder?
[260:45.17]Enter.
[260:56.91]Alright, let's do some melee.

[263:21.20]Alright, let's watch it.

[263:22.44]Okay.
[263:53.60]who are you is this your video do you guys like pickles on fast food burgers I really don't
[264:19.45]That took you two minutes to set up for five seconds.
[264:21.25]Well, I didn't have a window capture.
[264:23.55]So I got to go over to OBS, set up a window capture, say yes, accept, get the right window, put it up there.
[264:29.23]Alright, now go to the capture settings, put it up onto the top of the screen and put it into the source.
[264:34.32]I didn't have it set for capture a window today.
[264:48.50]How am I losing so much health?
[264:49.70]This game sucks.
[265:14.05]I'm seeing a lot of D faces today.
[265:17.25]Am I too weird today?
[265:18.89]Am I too weird for you guys today?
[265:21.78]Ow.
[265:21.84]Get over.
[265:34.24]Get over.
[266:02.00]Okay, fuck, marry, kill.
[266:03.44]Boomer, boomer, or boomer?
[266:22.14]I need that Molotov, please.
[266:35.57]weapon.
[266:37.01]I like this new weapon.
[266:44.08]Don't kill me.
[266:45.69]I need to prove myself to all these internet ants.
[267:06.14]Nice.
[267:06.40]How you guys doing?
[267:24.36]You guys having a good time?
[267:26.78]You guys chilling out?
[267:29.18]How's the vibe?
[267:29.94]Vibes kind of feel pretty great today, don't they?
[267:32.32]Feel good to me.
[267:36.49]The vibes have been pretty great on the last like 10 streams in a row.
[267:45.47]I'm full out on vibes right now.
[268:00.74]I need to get out of here.
[268:01.84]I need to, yeah, watch out.
[268:06.82]20k or what the hell?
[268:19.88]That's not good.
[268:20.94]Was it 15?
[268:24.26]You crashed out like 30 times last 10 streams.
[268:26.68]No, I haven't.
[268:27.22]No, I have not.
[268:29.78]No, I have not.
[268:31.80]I can assure you I haven't.
[268:34.48]The range is so long.
[268:49.84]I'm saying that I'm saying crash out a lot because I feel like it's a thing that everybody else is saying and I'm saying it to try to fit in.
[269:15.37]I'm crashing in, yeah.
[269:25.23]Why did you read that?
[269:26.14]I don't know, because I just read shit.
[269:35.70]Okay.
[269:38.24]What do I want to do here?
[269:49.55]I didn't really notice this doing very much.
[269:51.33]Maybe 2% now?
[270:02.78]Can you see how much HP you actually have?
[270:04.52]Oh no.
[270:08.15]You smoke cigarettes in your house.
[270:09.42]I don't smoke cigarettes.
[270:11.34]What is this theory that I smoke cigarettes now because I get up every hour?
[270:15.02]Officer, I've seen it.
[270:18.88]Oh, he must smoke cigarettes because he gets up now.
[270:21.44]I don't smoke cigarettes.
[270:25.99]At all, ever.
[270:33.46]I'm playing with one hand right now, so I would say you shouldn't bet on this one.
[270:36.94]Because I have a coffee in my other hand, relax.
[270:50.84]This is just a money run.
[271:11.06]Oh, shit.
[271:23.02]It's because of your voice cracks?
[271:26.14]And my voice cracks because I spent 25 years doing grandpa voices and reading all of Goku.
[271:34.36]Now I've got... My vocal cords have been used.
[271:50.23]This thing's actually really good.
[272:08.95]Plus, it depends on the day, too.
[272:09.97]I'm sure you guys can relate.
[272:11.71]Sometimes when you're just kind of hanging out.
[272:15.99]You just randomly have a voice that's, for some reason, like three or four times deeper than the one you currently have.
[272:23.28]Boy, sometimes it's like this.
[272:24.84]I don't know, it just depends.
[272:26.20]Depends on the day, the environment too.
[272:29.22]I mean, sometimes it's dry in Vegas.
[272:32.26]So sometimes I have a dry, raspy kind of throat.
[272:36.51]I drink a lot of water though, so I'm usually fine.
[273:00.01]I need to I need to press two.
[273:07.77]I'm so glad you can run with right mouse.
[273:10.07]That's so cool.
[273:17.22]I hope you didn't bet because I actually was playing with one hand.
[273:26.98]OK, this one's for real.
[273:32.02]Somebody said stop talking to us ants.
[273:41.48]You're cool, you're good, don't worry.
[273:47.11]OK.
[273:50.21]This one's for real.
[273:51.43]I'm just trying to get to level 20.
[274:00.69]This is going to be a quiet, no talking run.
[274:03.28]Appreciate the appreciate silence.
[274:12.37]I'm going for level 20.
[274:46.27]No, I'll sell it.
[274:53.67]Once I get level 20 and 20,000 would be great.
[275:40.78]Is it 2% per kill or per hit?
[275:42.53]I feel like it's per kill.
[276:37.34]Back to melee, come on.
[276:45.59]Pretty good.
[276:50.47]Keep it up.
[276:51.71]I do need a crate soon.
[277:46.59]be something good.
[277:47.05]Come on.
[277:50.16]That might be really good.
[277:51.82]Oh, is that better than what I have?
[277:55.45]Might be.
[278:16.74]Okay, uh, I gotta get rid of this... Axe.
[278:22.22]Not the axe, the... You know what I mean?
[278:45.79]Good.
[278:49.71]Who else is locked in right now?
[278:51.25]That's a good weapon.
[279:14.80]Hold it.
[279:56.14]Nice.
[280:00.73]Get a crate.
[280:03.95]Going very, very well.
[280:07.41]Just keep it that way.
[280:42.34]How many hours can you go without weed?
[280:43.86]What's your PB?
[280:44.62]Why did I even look at chat?
[280:51.78]Um... What are you talking about?
[281:07.25]Oh, I gotta get whatever's in there.
[281:13.28]What is it?
[281:13.60]What is it?
[281:13.88]What is it?
[281:14.86]Good.
[281:15.14]That's really good.
[281:26.51]Fuck.
[281:31.65]I need to get some... I gotta kill stuff with the melee.
[281:34.18]I need health.
[281:46.49]Yo, oh boy
[282:17.86]give me one more boom alright get out of the way let me at least collect some money no you dickheads um I I oh that's a lot of money nice okay
[282:42.81]I could probably beat you in a weed smoking competition.
[282:45.13]I bet you you could because it doesn't take very much for me.
[282:51.37]And no, I'm not the kind of person that's like, hey, you know what?
[282:53.76]Might as well like, let's go fucking crazy.
[282:57.14]No.
[282:58.74]Ooh, we can do times two.
[283:00.12]This will be fun.
[283:13.87]I haven't done it in a while, though.
[283:15.07]I actually really haven't done it in a pretty long time at this point.
[283:27.56]Discipline Dandy?
[283:31.34]Are you done with it?
[283:33.52]No, no.
[283:34.08]I mean, I'm just doing it whenever I think it's good to do.
[283:41.00]More melee.
[283:41.36]Okay.
[283:44.16]Alright, that's all my money.
[283:50.54]What is it to... Let me... How much is some of this stuff?
[283:52.44]Because if I get... That fire axe was kind of good.
[283:58.85]The katana is awesome as well.
[284:00.43]Alright, I'm going to go all in on katana.
[284:11.94]I haven't smoked or anything in over a month and a half.
[284:13.67]At least.
[284:14.41]I had to get healthy, though.
[284:36.33]And I, you know, obviously like I had the, I've had a whole smorgasbord of annoying medical problems the last five years of my life.
[284:43.92]So just trying to stay, trying to be a little healthier, especially as I get older.
[285:20.25]No, I just told you why.
[285:28.70]What's your favorite SNL skit?
[285:31.08]Uh, that would have to be Will Ferrell as Satan.
[285:34.68]Trying to learn how to make a song.
[285:37.91]Or he's somebody, some musician was looking to sell his soul for a song.
[285:45.67]who the fuck it even was but it's uh that's probably up there zoing goes boing goes I just got bit by the love bat and it's driving me mad oh that one wasn't very good
[286:15.75]Oh, I turned the difficulty up.
[286:17.21]That's right.
[286:17.61]Oops.
[286:26.22]There's a guy named Fred and he's got a pair of slacks.
[286:30.06]Ooh, Fred's got slacks on the boulevard.
[286:33.76]This guitar is just out of tune.
[286:45.97]This one does not fuck around at all.
[287:02.71]Ow!
[287:11.19]Is your favorite dad rock song?
[287:13.17]Sweet Child of Mine?
[287:14.27]No.
[287:20.71]Can I play with madness on Iron Maiden?
[287:23.53]Does that count?
[287:39.26]Stares at his crystal ball.
[287:41.10]No, no, no, no, no.
[287:42.47]Can I play with madness?
[287:58.17]I would play it right now, but I haven't set up the make it so stuff doesn't go through VODs.
[288:04.99]And I told the archive channel that I would try to make their lives a little easier.
[288:10.18]Because, uh... It's just like, uh, hey, like, all these VODs are fucked.
[288:15.78]And I'm like, oh, yeah, they are.
[288:21.88]Especially those WoW streams, I was just playing music.
[288:36.16]For how poorly this was going, it's not really going poorly.
[288:39.58]I don't know how.
[288:40.08]I would be just all melee, but if you hit one of these guys, they just blow up on you.
[289:04.54]so deadly but if you like right they're they're anti-melee these like these big guys they're you pop them they just kill you
[289:30.11]Yeah, I have a bunch of Dark Souls clips.
[289:32.00]I will do that soon.
[289:35.28]In fact... Why don't we watch one right now?
[289:54.90]I'm going to give some context to this one because this is by far one of my favorite clips that I think I've ever recorded.
[290:01.01]And it's not because it's particularly crazy.
[290:04.01]It's just what happens in it.
[290:06.73]And the nature of FromSoftware Games.
[290:11.91]I'll break it down in a second.
[290:12.73]Let me...
[290:15.17]Oh, you know, here's what I'll do.
[290:16.47]During the break, after the next break.
[290:20.47]There's a break coming up here in like 10 minutes or so.
[290:22.93]I'll set it up for after the break.
[290:24.79]Because it requires a lot of talk.
[290:26.07]We have to talk a lot about it.
[290:30.60]But the nature of FromSoftware universes is what makes me laugh at this.
[290:35.42]And it's why I continue to laugh at it for at least, it's been like a year and a half, two years.
[290:58.73]He's not going to show it.
[290:59.67]No, I will show it after the next break.
[291:12.30]I feel like I've gotten kind of good at this game.
[291:17.14]I'm just grinding right now.
[291:18.66]I'm having fun.
[291:34.69]Don't pop that yet.
[291:36.15]Uh-oh.
[291:43.23]There's a lot of money over there that I just lost because I walked off the screen.
[291:46.91]Oh, shit.
[291:49.16]It's not good.
[291:51.90]Why can I not shoot?
[291:52.58]Come on.
[292:00.06]No.
[292:00.44]No.
[292:12.61]Do a full melee run.
[292:15.89]I will now.
[292:20.33]Let's do this.
[292:25.19]Okay, I have maxed out melee.
[292:28.37]It's time just to smoke everybody.
[292:31.79]Take away this.
[292:32.68]I'm going to upgrade his... Check me out.
[292:35.14]Watch this.
[292:36.90]Let's go with katana.
[292:39.06]And I'm going to upgrade it like enough times like this.
[292:46.11]Okay, it's 10,000 to upgrade the Katana.
[293:00.99]Can I even refund the bat?
[293:02.25]I don't think I can.
[293:04.67]No, you can't refund weapon upgrades.
[293:13.12]stick with it for now because it's fine and then I'll just make sure the katana is the thing I upgrade I'm going full melee and can I upgrade the healing no let's try I'll do full melee and only use the sniper to kill the the boomers or the big boom whatever they called
[293:42.70]Hey, you can refund the game now.
[293:44.25]Why would I do that?
[293:45.13]I think this game is wonderful.
[293:46.11]I don't want to chainsaw.
[293:55.01]I'm okay with this.
[293:55.57]Alright.
[293:59.97]Full melee, only bat.
[294:06.35]This actually might work out pretty well.
[294:07.75]It's on the higher difficulty as well, so things are going to spawn all over the place.
[294:13.55]And if I'm not going to try to actually get very many crates or anything, I'm just going to stay right here.
[294:21.96]Just only pop the big boomers.
[294:25.00]Yeah, like this.
[294:29.68]I fucked it up already.
[294:36.31]That's pretty good.
[294:37.13]What was it, three hits to kill one of the big guys?
[294:50.15]Is there an avenue where I can kill the boomers and not in melee range and not have to worry about it?
[294:56.58]Definitely not.
[294:57.30]Look at how huge that explosion is.
[294:58.36]It's gigantic.
[295:20.86]Damn, actually kind of good.
[295:35.61]Oof.
[295:39.92]That was pretty good too.
[295:41.10]Don't get trapped in here.
[295:47.20]It's easy to get stuck in this damn cemetery or whatever it is.
[296:00.58]you can melee them I feel like I every time I try I explode the boomer with the tip of the katana you can avoid the explosion oh really
[296:39.72]The bat is great.
[296:40.48]It has a little bit of knockback.
[296:41.45]It just, it does have a small range.
[296:44.05]You're right.
[296:49.68]I feel like I'm going to miss the knockback though.
[297:15.57]Did you beat Arx Vitalis in 24 hours?
[297:17.83]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[297:20.24]Yeah, I... Yeah, I... I didn't play it.
[297:27.36]I hyped it up and then I just didn't install the mod and then I said, wait, this Zombieville game looks kind of cool.
[297:33.52]And here we are now.
[297:37.20]That's on me, you're right.
[297:53.56]That leech is good though.
[298:14.41]Come on, get out of here.
[298:21.11]Come on.
[298:24.19]Geez.

[298:49.38]No, I need to pick it up.
[298:50.32]You have to hold the button to pick it up and I have to be right next to it.
[298:54.41]This is bad.
[298:54.75]Did I get it?
[299:00.33]I did.

[301:58.02]How does that sound?
[302:07.88]No, I want to do this.
[302:08.82]I want that katana.
[302:15.67]This thing is so expensive.
[302:25.81]Pump the bat to plus 10.
[302:26.99]It might be pretty cheap.
[302:28.23]That's true too.
[302:29.31]I think I screwed this up, but it's alright.
[302:43.88]It's why Katana is so good.
[302:45.16]It's so expensive.
[302:45.88]What is this?
[302:46.46]This is what?
[302:46.92]Plus five right now?
[302:47.76]Alright.

[302:54.11]Money run.
[302:59.14]I got snacks for the clips.
[303:00.64]Well, it's only one clip.
[303:11.13]Upgrade melee weapons and precision weapons.
[303:15.21]Does a melee weapon count as a precision?
[303:20.83]Just quick money run.
[303:21.58]We're good.
[303:44.61]I'd be happy if before the end of the stream I get to like level 21.
[303:47.47]I want to see the next skull come through.
[303:54.35]I'll be happy to get to like 25 before the stream ends.
[303:58.93]I will feel accomplished.
[304:05.59]Here the original developer of Fate hates the remake and had nothing to do with it.
[304:10.66]That's unfortunate.
[304:37.75]Hey Jerma, did you know that?
[304:38.81]I don't know if that was supposed to be funny, but I read it humorous and it came across funny to me.
[304:45.23]Do you think your streaming career could survive if you could use shortwave radio only?
[305:08.23]Well, I'm in my new game plus arc right now.
[305:13.76]So, I don't know.
[305:22.48]I think it'd be fun to do that.
[305:23.34]It'd be fun just to play with it.
[305:24.77]That's a good med kit.
[305:32.95]I will definitely take it.
[305:43.95]Plus six med kit?
[305:45.17]Oof.
[305:53.14]You're in new game plus one.
[305:54.52]Something like that.
[306:00.38]The katana is melee plus precision.
[306:02.28]That's... That thing is going to be disgusting then.
[306:10.95]Just a money run.
[306:11.65]It's fine.
[306:22.85]15k for the katana.
[306:23.57]Alright, so I need at least 25 because I want the precision.
[306:27.29]17,000?
[306:27.31]Okay, I'll take it.
[306:49.91]I should get the money upgrade for the melee stuff too then, right?
[307:04.34]Granny no scope?
[307:06.84]Yep.
[307:32.23]We are, what did I say, seven minutes?
[307:35.11]We are now about seven minutes away from the clip.
[307:40.71]What time is it?
[307:42.05]It is actually kind of late.
[307:43.15]I'll be up for a little while longer though.
[307:47.31]We'll do the clip and then I'll play this for a little bit longer.
[308:01.02]The clip does need discussion.
[308:02.68]I've been preparing a full stand-up routine around this one clip.
[308:07.74]So... It's like a seven-minute open mic set.
[308:14.52]It's kind of late.
[308:15.51]Maybe I'll just talk.
[308:20.29]Ooh, yup.
[308:33.06]Why am I getting so much money this round?
[309:08.89]Okay, 20k is definitely a no.
[309:10.71]Yikes, that hurt.
[309:16.97]This one guy is just pissing me off here.
[309:19.22]Don't kill the big ones.
[309:31.11]Just a money run.
[309:31.79]Stop trying to kill stuff.
[309:41.72]I might get past level 20 here, geez.
[309:51.97]Could be the one.
[309:56.27]Oh no more, no more.
[310:00.51]That's a lot of money.
[310:01.23]Please let me get some of it.
[310:03.83]Oh.
[310:06.82]Sorry, OK.
[310:16.94]I got 22,000.
[310:19.22]That's enough to do this.
[310:22.27]20k to do the next one and then precision.
[310:24.27]I think I have enough for it.
[310:24.99]90.
[310:30.75]No, I don't.
[310:31.79]I could take some away from regen.
[310:51.91]When Holly comes back, will we not see you again?
[310:54.71]Holly's been back for like almost two weeks.
[310:57.86]It's been like a full week and a half.
[311:02.44]Alright.
[311:03.24]I'm going to do my BRB here.
[311:05.62]I'll be back.
[311:06.18]And when I get back, we're going to watch the Bloodborne clip.
[311:09.86]And let's see how you like it.
[311:14.21]We're back in three and a half minutes.
[311:18.25]You'll see ads in about 30 seconds or so.
[311:23.88]We're back.
[314:47.77]How you doing?
[314:48.57]I'm here.
[314:48.87]Just got back.
[315:06.19]How does the smoke break?
[315:09.65]The only kind of smoke break I'm going to take is smoking some ribs, OK?
[315:18.69]OK, welcome back.
[315:21.39]Hi everybody.
[315:23.01]So let's give some context to this clip.
[315:24.99]This is Bloodborne.
[315:25.97]And this is also one of the last areas of Bloodborne coming up.
[315:29.84]This is the final zone in the base game effectively.
[315:34.87]So if you don't, and this is, there's a character on screen right now that is a massive major, this is like a major spoiler character.
[315:41.95]So, um, just be aware of that.
[315:45.47]You're going to see something on screen that is what's that.
[315:48.55]And if you don't, if you've never played this game before that, I would suggest you come back to this clip, uh, later.
[315:54.80]Okay.
[315:55.86]So, uh, let me mute this because I don't want you to hear this.
[316:09.57]Okay, this clip is long, but it's because I had to capture it long.
[316:14.13]Let me get it in the right spot.
[316:28.66]Where the hell is it?
[316:34.89]Wait, where is it?
[316:35.61]How come I can't put it on here?
[316:41.07]There we go.
[316:41.43]Okay.
[316:42.85]So, the thing about Dark Souls games, and we're going to watch the clip.
[316:48.17]I'm going to give very little commentary until after.
[316:50.25]So, here we go.
[316:56.55]Are you ready to watch the Bloodborne clip?
[317:05.67]So, here we go.
[317:09.57]How loud is this going to be?
[317:15.30]Why is it running like shit?
[317:18.20]Hold on.
[317:18.66]I might have to minimize the game.
[317:21.82]I'm going to save the game.
[317:22.62]Hold on a sec.
[317:25.10]Because this game is lagging my whole computer right now.
[317:27.21]So give me one second.
[317:27.87]I can save and quit.
[317:28.51]I'll be right back.
[317:30.85]It should be able to go like this.
[317:32.55]Hold on.
[317:38.07]Stalling?
[317:38.91]I'm not stalling.
[317:42.62]Alright.
[317:42.82]Did that help?
[317:48.29]I think that helped.
[317:50.33]Okay.
[317:51.37]So you ready?
[317:56.99]Playing Bloodborne, walking around.
[318:13.80]And then a fucking meth lab exploded somewhere four miles down the road.
[318:20.45]And that's the reason why this makes me laugh so hard is because the rules are FromSoftware games.
[318:27.89]If anything dies anywhere in the world, you get credit for it.
[318:35.49]So if there's a fucking meth lab explosion in a neighborhood, like 10 neighborhoods down the street, you get credit for it.
[318:45.01]Like you got those kills.
[318:48.91]And how far does that go?
[318:51.59]How far does that go in this world?
[318:54.59]And it makes me, it just makes me laugh every single time.
[318:57.63]Because you're just walking around and all of a sudden there's a fucking, like, like a bomb goes off and I get credit for all of it.
[319:13.67]It's so fucking loud.
[319:20.64]I think it was because I ran by.
[319:23.78]Look, I'm doing the run to get to the... You know, you run by all this shit to get through to the wet nurse, right?
[319:33.93]And I think, I don't know what happened, but they all collectively ran off the cliff at the same time.
[319:38.45]One of them did it right there, and I was like, oh, that was weird.
[319:41.53]And then all of them died at the same time.
[319:49.48]And this was so loud on my screen too.
[319:52.18]It was like, it was deafening.
[319:58.70]And all I can think about is just like, there's like a cloud in the distance.
[320:01.98]I didn't have anything to do with that.
[320:04.10]Yet I get the points for it.
[320:09.98]It's one of my favorite parts of FromSoftware games.
[320:17.54]The game is too hard.
[320:26.47]It's a pretty good game.
[320:31.96]This dude has 14 insight at the end of the game?
[320:34.62]What the fuck?
[320:35.30]What do you know?
[320:42.68]But, like, if two guys are in a bar fight and I'm just in this world and one of the guys, like, I don't know, like, throws the other guy off a fucking cliff, I get credit for it.
[320:56.70]That's kind of unfair.
[320:59.51]How come nobody else gets credit for that?
[321:04.07]That was mildly amusing, +2.
[321:06.01]Hey.
[321:09.27]I think it's pretty funny.
[321:13.89]So what was the stand-up routine?
[321:16.25]Let me tell you something.
[321:17.71]When you're playing these FromSoftware games, can you imagine, I don't know, I already did it.
[321:26.24]But that's one of the clips that I like a lot.
[321:29.02]I have like 300 of these clips.
[321:33.78]Genuinely, there are 300 or 400 of those.
[321:37.90]Of varying intelligence and varying funniness to me.
[321:46.08]Do another one.
[321:49.55]Make a Breaking Bad joke next time.
[321:51.19]I thought that just like the meth lab exploding down the street was kind of, because like it's just, to me that was what I was thinking of in the moment.
[321:58.33]Because I'm sitting there going, what the fuck was that?
[322:01.03]What, who's like fucking house exploded?
[322:03.09]Like what the hell just happened?
[322:04.45]And then all of a sudden it's like, you get all this credit.
[322:12.13]Next clip.
[322:13.73]No, I gotta go back to grandma and kill zombies.
[322:20.90]Okay, let's open that back up.
[322:30.65]Clip stream tomorrow?
[322:35.93]No, I probably won't stream for a day or two.
[322:40.05]Coming up here.
[322:45.89]14 insight at the end of the game.
[322:46.99]There's nothing wrong with that.
[322:50.40]Turn this back up.
[322:53.44]So there is multiplayer.
[322:54.30]Yeah.
[322:59.29]Okay, cool.
[323:00.17]So there you go.
[323:00.87]That's the one.
[323:01.95]That's not even the best clip.
[323:04.39]It's a Dark Souls 2 clip of somebody that I see killing an NPC immediately without hesitation.
[323:11.66]And it's like, it's up there.
[323:14.14]Sorry for the spoiler.
[323:23.48]Alright, let me... I'll probably play this for like another hour.
[323:27.20]I'm enjoying it.
[323:27.86]I like it a lot.
[323:28.42]Alright, so I was doing melee.
[323:32.67]I... I need... How much is it to get the katana up?
[323:40.73]20,000.
[323:42.51]I need 10,000 more.
[323:44.07]Alright, let's go.
[323:44.87]Money run.
[323:49.81]Are the WoW streams done for good?
[323:51.91]No.
[323:52.65]It's just... There's a lot of things that I just kind of got grabbed by.
[323:56.57]Let's just unlock everything.
[324:04.67]I wonder... You probably get something for unlocking everybody.
[324:13.23]I want to play it.
[324:13.88]I've wanted to play it.
[324:19.33]I'm down, I am.
[324:26.20]Dracula kind of ruined everything.
[324:28.16]I want to play Dracula 3.
[324:33.40]One of the main reasons why I actually decided I was going to stream again for, you know, on a regular basis is I looked at my Steam library, looked at my GOG library.
[324:43.73]I looked at like just other things going on.
[324:46.85]I just said, I have a lot of stuff that I never did that I always thought would be kind of fun.
[324:53.29]And obviously I've had some more time.
[325:01.34]But I just had a massive list.
[325:04.16]And I thought, you know what?
[325:05.32]I think it would be kind of a disservice to myself and anybody else that likes to be here to have had all these things that I wanted to do.
[325:13.42]And I just never did them.
[325:15.96]There's like a lot of just random things.
[325:20.81]Doesn't matter what they are, so.
[325:26.53]It's not just all about a video game, right?
[325:28.29]It's... I don't know.
[325:31.82]The world's kind of fucked up right now.
[325:34.42]And... Kind of looking for something fun.
[325:38.68]In my own life, too.
[325:54.03]Sorcery Council?
[325:54.97]Yeah.
[326:11.58]So I made it a point that this year I was going to be like, no, this year I'm going to have fun this year.
[326:17.46]I'm going to do it.
[326:20.26]I just said, fuck it.
[326:21.24]I'm just gonna... I'm going to choose to try to have a good time.
[326:25.93]That's what I'm doing.
[326:28.19]And I think it's actually working out pretty well.
[326:32.94]And I'm choosing to lock the fuck in right now.
[326:58.34]I don't know how many times we have to go over this before you accept the answer of, okay, I would poop my pants and a zombie would eat my brain and I would die.
[327:06.83]Is that what you're looking for?
[327:10.95]Well, man, I would hide and then I would make sandwiches.
[327:13.89]No, you're looking for he would poop his pants and then a zombie would kill him and he would get hit by a train or something.
[327:23.50]That's what you want to hear, so I'm going to give it to you.
[327:49.24]It's the comedy answer is always going to triumph.
[327:51.70]That's right.
[327:52.08]What would you do if you were Superman?
[328:28.85]I would have my laser eyes.
[328:30.33]That's all I've ever wanted.
[328:33.65]You would just cheat at gambling?
[328:35.58]I don't think Superman cares about how much money he has.
[328:40.16]He's Superman.
[328:47.10]I feel like when you're Superman, you've kind of... You don't really need much else.
[328:58.73]Like, does Superman need, uh, like a Lamborghini?
[329:01.05]I mean, maybe?
[329:03.07]That'd be kind of funny, actually.
[329:05.73]Superman just gets really into, like, making money and shit.
[329:18.91]Superman, like, losing fucking money on the stock market, like, flips his desk over.
[329:30.45]Down 10, 20% in one day?
[329:31.88]No, that's unbelievable.
[329:35.46]No, no, no, no, no.
[329:36.21]That should be illegal.
[329:58.88]Oh, I looked away for a second.
[330:08.11]Injustice happens because he put it all into crypto.
[330:11.89]I don't even know the story.
[330:12.99]What is the actual story of injustice?
[330:14.89]Maybe I would get that joke if I knew what the actual injustice story is.
[330:19.05]Alright, this thing is getting there.
[330:30.70]That's right, Katana run.
[330:37.15]Lois dead, Superman mad.
[330:39.79]Is that what it is?
[330:45.17]Superman kills... Superman, are these spoilers?
[330:52.86]Yeah, I mean, I guess.
[331:01.36]I don't know how, why Superman would be evil.
[331:04.26]I guess, well, maybe I do.
[331:10.86]Like when, when, when, when like you get cut off in traffic for like the 20th time, maybe Superman's just like, what the fuck?
[331:15.89]Fuck this place.
[331:17.05]Earth sucks.
[331:37.81]That's a Family Guy kind of joke.
[331:39.63]Yeah, I could see that, him in traffic.
[331:42.73]Come on!
[331:43.55]Go!
[331:45.21]What is happening here?
[331:46.37]It's like a text from Lois.
[331:49.15]Like, what do you want for dinner?
[331:52.22]Like, ugh!
[331:55.50]Then he just starts lasering.
[332:03.82]Yeah, that's got Family Guy on it.
[332:10.14]Alright, let's see.
[332:11.34]Ooh, this still hurt me.
[332:14.00]Was I too close?
[332:14.79]A little too close?
[332:22.19]If you were Superman, you would be Homelander.
[332:27.51]Ooh, it actually does work.
[332:28.56]Okay.
[332:36.08]Shit, you have to be good at the video game to do that.
[332:42.22]This is really good though, it's actually pretty great.
[332:52.74]No knockback though.
[333:07.63]Ouch.
[333:14.13]Is it really only two swings to kill a big guy?
[333:21.15]Kind of crazy.
[333:26.61]You like the show Hannibal?
[333:28.52]No, I don't like shows with blood.
[333:30.10]That's a blood show with bloody stuff?
[333:33.32]No, no, no, no.
[333:33.64]Yuck.
[334:01.61]Collect money.
[334:18.78]This thing is so deadly.
[334:24.77]That knockback is killing me though.
[334:26.17]Well, the no knockback I mean.
[334:30.45]Oh, it's all going to fall apart right here.
[334:51.93]The best is yet to come.
[334:53.97]That's kind of what it sounds like.
[335:11.77]I do miss the regen.
[335:18.08]The regen's killing me.
[335:19.09]I would have already been at full health by now.
[335:43.82]Could be going worse.
[335:48.26]Not another one already.
[335:56.51]Oh, that's it.
[335:59.43]At least give me the money.
[336:29.06]No, I thought I killed you.
[336:48.79]The only way I can heal is by doing this.
[337:02.91]I'm not paying attention.
[337:03.87]Is it actually healing for a lot?
[337:12.83]I guess it is.
[337:13.41]Yeah, it is.
[337:14.39]Okay.
[337:31.93]Blow up on me like that.
[337:34.27]Wow.
[337:35.56]That's a crazy gun.
[337:46.08]Whoa, what did I just kill by?
[337:47.54]Something just hit me in the head.
[337:54.45]Streams have been always fun and comforting.
[337:58.04]That's good to know.
[337:58.98]It'd be bad if you said that these phrases make me feel like shit, so I'm glad that's the case.
[338:03.15]30,000.
[338:04.87]Yeah, no, that's... Thank you.
[338:16.65]I'll try to just go for 30k.
[338:32.13]I'm all in on the Katana.
[338:33.17]Let's go.
[338:37.02]I have, I think, two or three points in the Vampire perk.
[338:44.50]What about Conqueror's Bad for a Day?
[338:46.10]Yeah, that sounds fun.
[338:47.21]I would do that.
[338:54.25]That's just a better version of this.
[339:04.35]How long is Conquer?
[339:15.81]Kind of a long game, right?
[339:32.99]Chat's gonna be on their best behavior for that one.
[339:39.41]It is what it is.
[339:40.05]It's alright.
[340:06.01]Hey Jerma, as a white man, have you seen Severance yet?
[340:08.25]Uh, no, I have not.
[340:19.34]I have not seen it.
[340:39.80]Liar.
[340:40.18]You talked about it yesterday.
[340:42.44]Yeah, I talked about should I watch it yesterday.
[340:44.81]I didn't watch the whole show in 12 hours.
[340:55.04]I lost all that money.
[340:57.72]No, it's still here.
[340:58.36]Okay, good.
[341:02.28]That's a big boomer too.
[341:03.44]Look at that.
[341:05.42]He is chunky.
[341:06.16]He's full of all kinds of stuff.
[341:23.79]I gotta get to level 21.
[341:26.26]I can't turn the stream off until I get to 21.
[341:52.84]These one-hit KOs, though, are gonna just get better.
[341:55.40]I gotta get better at doing that.
[342:01.98]If I can block that down, I will be unstoppable.
[342:16.80]Get the chainsaw.
[342:17.64]Why don't you have any Hollywood interests?
[342:24.67]What is a Hollywood interest?
[342:29.00]Like interested in shows made by Hollywood?
[342:42.51]That was kind of scary.
[342:57.07]No, acting.
[342:57.89]I don't want to do that.
[343:05.56]I thought about that a long time ago.
[343:23.40]Like Josh just said, I get to act at my own scream every day.
[343:27.04]I had a lot of fun here.
[343:33.41]There's a lot of shit that is just fun to do.
[343:38.89]So I guess in my mind it was why... Oh, I'm going to go do a bunch of auditions.
[343:43.77]We'll just do it here.
[343:46.77]And people will either tell me, hey, that sucked fucking ballsack or that was kind of good.
[343:51.88]So I can do it here.
[343:56.40]Oh, I need this money.
[344:12.08]I like the more conversational stuff, though.
[344:14.04]I've always been that way.
[344:16.99]I like making up a scenario that is just probably never going to happen or making up something to do for 10 minutes.
[344:26.45]It's more fun, I think, to tell stories than it is to make them in a way.
[344:36.54]Takes a lot of work, takes a lot of time, takes a lot of money.
[344:44.32]I still can't do it in one more run.
[344:58.37]This is the last time I spam it.
[345:00.03]Play Mystery of the Druids.
[345:03.61]Okay, I'll take a look.
[345:15.50]Takes too long to level up stuff in this game.
[345:17.16]Well, I actually could be playing probably a lot better.
[345:24.63]I'm not using the environment.
[345:25.79]I'm not going to get in chests.
[345:26.89]I'm just doing katana mode.
[345:30.42]And I took all the points out of the money upgrade.
[345:36.00]So I should be getting 10 to 20% more money, but I'm not.
[345:39.58]I'm just killing things with the katana.
[346:05.84]Fury of the Druids would be really funny.
[346:07.30]Is it that good?
[346:08.52]How have I not heard of this?
[346:11.24]Is it fun?
[346:18.96]Shit.
[346:22.11]It's similar to Dracula.
[346:29.43]Yeah, let's definitely get through Dracula, at least the trilogy.
[346:31.89]I want to do the three.
[346:35.01]Maybe we'll do that soon too.
[346:37.03]But that's currently in right now.
[346:40.53]We did the first two.
[346:41.35]Maybe we should just kind of finish it up with the last one.
[346:44.59]That game's great.
[346:57.50]I had a lot of fun playing that.
[346:58.62]That was a lot of fun.
[347:06.80]I said I was going to stop saying ooh.
[347:07.84]Yeah, because if you were really good at this and you were really good at bringing enemies and aggroing them and putting them in a gigantic train and running around.
[347:32.61]You can probably get 30, 40,000 every time you play.
[347:48.49]How come I stream so late?
[347:51.77]Well, I didn't.
[347:52.81]I started at.
[347:55.59]What, like 4?
[347:55.95]4.30? 4.30?
[348:02.81]Sell it before it goes away, please.
[348:04.51]Damn it.
[348:14.27]He's got an achievement for selling that.
[348:26.00]Do more circles instead of back and forth.
[348:29.65]Yeah, and it's also kind of grouping them together and running around like this and... Trying to get actual... The explosives, I think, would be really you meta this game.
[348:42.04]Yeah.
[348:42.82]You put... Dump all your points.
[348:44.00]That's a lot of money.
[348:44.98]Holy shit.
[348:45.38]That's the most I think I've ever seen.
[348:46.40]Alright.
[348:52.73]I can do another upgrade to the katana.
[349:16.86]Yeah, that's not gonna do anything.
[349:18.06]Katana is the only thing I'm gonna... Yeah, I gotta just use the katana.
[349:25.47]Nice.
[349:25.83]What's the most memorable stream you've ever done besides Dollhouse?
[349:41.07]I think they all kind of do something for me.
[349:44.69]I mean, it's really easy for a stream like this and others like this to kind of fall into the back of your head.
[349:49.93]But any of the, let's call it a little bit more thought-out streams, I cherish them all.
[350:01.64]Doesn't have to necessarily be a big production or something.
[350:12.96]Too close, too close.
[350:21.19]What do you got?
[350:23.77]Oh, what am I doing?
[350:26.24]I spent so long just staring at that.
[350:27.94]That was so stupid.
[350:53.35]Alright, don't get hit.
[350:54.07]I gotta get money back.
[350:55.27]I gotta health back, I mean.
[351:04.16]No.
[351:23.96]That's it.
[351:24.94]No shit.
[351:25.94]I didn't even see him coming.
[351:31.58]This goes to level 65.
[351:34.80]Holy shit, that's crazy actually.
[351:40.39]I guess if you take a look at all the upgrades.
[351:42.81]Yeah, look at all these.
[351:47.91]Every single one of these can be upgraded.
[351:50.35]Probably 10 times.
[351:53.57]Yeah, this can go again.
[351:54.27]Katana plus six.
[351:59.63]You know what?
[352:01.07]Alright.
[352:03.39]Let's see.
[352:14.52]House number two, Invitational.
[352:19.70]Invitational.
[352:21.90]House Flipper 3 Invitational is going to be fun.
[352:29.38]Yeah, now I'm going for Vamp now.
[352:46.93]There's going to be a lot of...
[352:51.14]Let's put it this way, I wouldn't have done it again if there wasn't a really cool reason to do it a third time.
[353:00.52]Or at least what I think is a cool thing to do.
[353:10.55]and kind of like last time um I think I'm going to be working directly with the devs on a couple things so it should be pretty cool
[353:37.49]Yeah, they've been super on board with everything.
[353:38.97]It's fun.
[353:39.97]It's funny.
[353:43.55]Who would have thought that six or seven years ago playing House Flipper that it would turn out to be like one of my favorite just like fucking stream games.
[353:56.04]It's just crazy.
[354:09.54]Yeah, there's a little bit of a twist this time.
[354:11.74]It's not going to be just build a house.
[354:15.07]This one's a little bit of a twist.
[354:23.43]This thing is shredding, by the way.
[354:42.85]I think it's one swing per regular zombie now.
[355:06.87]Shit, I looked at chat and somebody said something funny.
[355:13.72]Oh my God, I did the same thing again.
[355:15.46]What am I doing?
[355:25.17]That's a bad spawn.
[355:31.58]Stop spawning the big guys.
[355:45.75]Six big guys in a row.
[355:56.49]Ow, that hurt.
[356:08.52]I don't trust myself with the big guys anymore.
[356:26.30]okay we'll poke and Ster get dethroned that's gonna be very interesting because there will be teams this time but way way way way what I would consider to be oh you'll see
[356:54.81]It's an unbalanced team.
[356:55.85]They can't be together.
[356:56.76]Do you break up the... Well, here's the thing.
[357:02.06]I don't know.
[357:04.92]I think there could be a lot of competition this time for a lot of reasons.
[357:14.48]Do you break up a top-seeded team or do you... Maybe there's others that could be top-seeded as well.
[357:24.00]I don't know.
[357:24.78]We'll have to see.
[357:43.71]I actually think I would prefer this.
[357:45.25]I don't have to aim down sights to do it.
[358:08.05]Going down that road would be fun too, doing the freeze of the explosives.
[358:21.90]Do not explode on me, please.
[358:33.43]Hey, come on.
[358:34.91]Oh, plus eight grenade launcher.
[358:37.37]Oh boy.
[358:40.04]The first one of those that I've seen.
[358:41.50]Maybe I should go look for health because this is definitely one that I can get past 21.
[358:48.12]Oh yeah, this thing is disgusting.
[359:03.82]Damn.
[359:07.11]Do not blow up on me.
[359:34.35]So much to kill this guy.
[359:36.01]Holy shit.
[359:36.95]He's still alive.
[359:41.99]Oh, come on, man.
[359:43.41]What the fuck?
[359:44.15]You have so much health.
[359:45.92]Run.
[359:48.98]Oh my goodness gracious.
[359:50.58]That's it.
[359:51.82]That's it.
[359:55.88]That guy had so much health.
[359:59.10]That was a plus eight grenade launcher.
[360:08.77]Uh, I need the leech, I think.
[360:22.15]16,000.
[360:24.29]Yeah.
[360:25.04]Might as well do it.
[360:27.74]And then precision.
[360:30.78]I neglected this the entire game.
[360:42.36]I didn't unlock everybody.
[360:50.17]It's 40,000 for this?
[360:50.77]Alright, so let's go.
[360:56.97]Have you reacted to Shrek 5 yet?
[361:01.10]Oops, sorry.
[361:01.78]I mean, it's a 9 second teaser.
[361:20.55]I'm also 40.
[361:34.92]And.
[361:35.12]It's true.
[361:41.27]You're never too old for strife or whatever this fucking name is.
[361:46.41]The big green guy.
[361:55.99]Yeah, I almost called him Strep.
[362:02.39]No, Strep is the... Shrek cousin with the mustache.
[362:07.39]Like Snoopy.
[362:08.11]What is Snoopy's cousin's name?
[362:10.35]It's Spike.
[362:12.11]Not Strep.
[362:12.71]Spike.
[362:14.85]I love Spike, though.
[362:15.75]Spike is cool.
[362:29.75]No, Snoopy's cousin, not Shrek's cousin.
[362:44.64]Ow.
[362:47.07]Come on.
[362:47.75]Gwen.
[362:49.15]I need to farm health on this guy.
[363:10.16]Stop doing that.
[363:12.78]You pissed me off.
[363:19.46]You pissed me off.
[363:21.46]You pissed me off.
[363:33.67]That leech is really shining now.
[363:35.03]Holy shit, that was like almost half a bar.
[363:51.06]I only want to use the heal in an emergency.
[363:53.30]The Dream Painters by the House Flipper Devs looks like a cool game.
[364:05.03]Do they have another game?
[364:16.61]I actually haven't done very much in House Slippers since... I feel like they've updated it like a dozen times or so at this point.
[364:32.64]That's all the money they dropped?
[364:41.78]Is there an attack speed increase?
[364:43.48]Because if there is, I need to get it.
[365:13.42]How did you get through?
[365:14.04]How could I have been so careless?
[365:20.57]That has a garden update now?
[365:25.21]Gardening update.
[365:26.34]Cool.
[365:27.78]The first one did that.
[365:36.77]No, don't even attempt it.
[365:38.11]You know what you're capable of.
[365:39.19]What's the... Accept the things... Give me the strength to accept the things I cannot change.
[365:44.91]Courage to change the things I can.
[365:46.24]And the wisdom.
[365:49.84]Know the difference.
[365:52.56]That famous quote.
[365:56.60]Hold on.
[365:59.21]That was bad.
[366:14.82]Give Link the strength to accept the things he cannot change.
[366:21.15]Courage to Ganondorf to not fuck everybody's life up again.
[366:25.23]And the wisdom to Zelda to know... I'm gonna die.
[366:42.71]What's the one that Ganon wants?
[366:44.29]Power.
[366:46.89]It's power, courage, and wisdom, right?
[366:59.92]Imagine... Hey, bros.
[367:02.46]Imagine taking courage when you're going to have power.
[367:30.59]Nice.
[367:32.32]Went exactly according to plan.
[367:44.71]I need a crate actually.
[367:45.77]I need another weapon.
[367:55.16]That's bad.
[368:04.18]No, fuck you.
[368:04.99]You're getting too close.
[368:07.31]No.
[368:14.09]I'm almost at level 20.
[368:16.43]I got to run.
[368:16.95]I need to just farm.
[368:17.85]Forget about the money.
[368:30.52]No, that's not going to work out.
[368:42.47]Come on, give me 21.
[368:44.95]What is it?
[368:46.56]Oh, it's grenades.
[368:47.18]That's not good, but fine.
[369:13.89]21, hooray!
[369:16.11]Oh shit, we got a Joel raid.
[369:17.29]What's going on, everybody?
[369:21.93]Currently playing Zombieville 3D USA.
[369:26.82]And I just beat the master level.
[369:31.62]I made it to 21.
[369:32.74]I don't think any other gamers got in here yet.
[369:43.33]Hope you had a good stream, Joel.
[369:48.35]What's up?
[369:48.85]Hope you're well.
[369:49.43]22, by the way.
[369:52.82]We're seeing things that no one has seen before.
[370:00.24]I'm just telling whatever it is.
[370:02.12]Whoa!
[370:02.78]No, I'm not.
[370:03.48]That's cool.
[370:04.06]It's a plus 10 Syro gun.
[370:10.40]Holy smokes.
[370:11.46]Look at this thing.
[370:25.56]I'm happy no matter what.
[370:27.88]I do want to get a bunch of that money though.
[370:32.07]23.
[370:32.13]I can't end on 23.
[370:32.61]That's the fucking bad number, right?
[370:34.77]I guess go to 24.
[370:36.53]Nice.
[370:36.83]Okay, we're fine.
[370:38.21]Oh, thank goodness.
[370:43.35]That lasts probably a long time too.
[370:49.33]Do I have anything else besides?
[370:50.45]Oh God, I don't.
[370:52.68]I get 25.
[370:53.18]25 and I'm fine.
[370:54.80]I'll be happy at 25.
[371:01.92]Alright, cool.
[371:03.32]I did it.
[371:11.08]The raiders just got here in time for the Bloodborne clip.
[371:15.35]They did.
[371:15.67]Alright, I'm going to take my last break of the night.
[371:19.08]This would be it and I'll fiddle around with this for another 3040 minutes or so.
[371:26.83]Final break of the evening.
[371:28.09]Be right back.
[371:40.54]This would also be the last ad break as well, so see you guys soon.
[371:57.20]Hey, before the ad comes, somebody just said, hey, can you do the parrot thing?
[372:01.04]Oh, absolutely.
[372:03.85]Paper.
[372:04.45]Paper.
[372:05.79]Metal.
[372:08.31]Worry.
[372:09.58]There you go.
[372:11.86]See you later.
[375:25.84]Not quite back yet.
[375:28.63]Otto needs to go outside, so back in another two or three minutes.
[375:33.68]BRB.
[378:19.31]I just came back.
[378:19.95]I saw this message and I like this message.
[378:22.70]It's interesting and I'm deciphering it.
[378:24.40]This music sounds like the way Hint Water tastes.
[378:33.37]Interesting.
[378:45.89]When are you going to do an ASMR stream?
[378:47.73]These late night streams are the closest you are ever going to get to that happening.
[379:03.02]Collecting 40 Z coins unlocks the super mage blade.
[379:07.92]Oh my goodness.
[379:12.88]40,000 to go to Katana seven.
[379:21.53]it's kind of funny that so starting the stream at like four or five wait no I got money hold on I started off pretty high energy and now I'm we're at asmr stream now when did it happen I did there was a there was a it flipped that's funny
[379:48.43]Regen two would be nice.
[379:49.45]Yeah.
[379:51.47]Money though.
[379:52.21]Feel like I'm falling behind.
[380:00.19]Oops.
[380:02.98]Oops.
[380:10.72]You haven't really been high energy for like three years.
[380:14.94]I disagree.
[380:17.97]Maybe the last year or two.
[380:19.21]Well, I mean, I really didn't stream for the last almost two years.
[380:24.49]2022 was a monster high energy year though.
[380:29.83]I think I'm just going max on Vampire.
[380:35.06]And then this is just straight up damage, right?
[380:38.20]And then this.
[380:41.18]Horror game stream was high.
[380:42.30]Well, I mean, there's still going to be high energy streams.
[380:44.40]That's just the nature of it, right?
[381:05.95]You turned into a facecam streamer and it was your downfall.
[381:24.03]Oh yeah, this dude really hurt his career.
[381:33.50]I turned on that facecam and everything went to shit.
[381:41.96]It was the day that I did that first Scare Saturdays in 2016.
[381:45.17]Oh no, it was like 2012.
[381:56.32]I think an auto cam would be cute.
[381:57.50]The thing about an auto cam, though, is he moves around a lot.
[382:02.44]And he'll stay in the same spot for half an hour, maybe an hour.
[382:07.26]And then he's kind of like, I want to do something.
[382:10.48]Hey, Jeremy, get up.
[382:11.40]I want to like play or I want to go out or I want a treat or a snack.
[382:17.35]And I usually get up and kind of play with him for a little bit.
[382:20.49]So he doesn't really sit in the same place or like a dog cam for three, four or five hours.
[382:47.14]Take a picture of him, just say it's live.
[382:48.90]That's true.
[382:52.64]Get it.
[382:56.60]Whoever told me to just do Kitana and just go all in?
[383:00.94]You just made this ship like $150,000.
[383:03.79]This has been crazy.
[383:17.28]I definitely want that.
[383:24.23]I wish there was a dodge roll.
[383:26.85]I just tried to do it every time I get in trouble.
[383:29.11]I always just try to dodge.
[383:32.85]I try to do the hook.
[383:47.93]I'm glad I got to 25, though.
[383:49.11]I can't believe there are 65 levels.
[383:50.81]Alright, has anybody ever done... There's probably somebody.
[383:58.62]If people do Rune Level 1 Redan, then somebody's going to be able to do no upgrades.
[384:04.34]Level 65, Zombieville, USA.
[384:20.47]How do you even know there's 65 levels?
[384:23.01]One guy in chat said that.
[384:25.84]And I don't know if it was real, but it could be.
[384:29.96]Considering we've already gone through three revolutions, almost into four.
[384:49.59]Kinda didn't want to do that, but whatever.
[385:21.56]Why do they keep doing that?
[385:22.74]They shouldn't be doing that.
[385:25.12]They should let me just kill them.
[385:28.18]Why?
[385:28.84]I don't like when games do this.
[385:30.43]They should just be standing still.
[385:31.85]And I should be able just to walk up to them and hit them.
[385:33.97]There shouldn't even be a health bar.
[385:35.85]What the fuck, man?
[385:37.37]Like, it's so fucking annoying.
[385:38.49]I feel like when I buy a game, I feel like I should be able to play it my way.
[385:49.40]It's like, I don't know, whatever.
[385:52.56]Oh no.
[386:01.99]Shit, this Paul is... I almost just said something like... You know what I'm gonna say, you know what I mean?
[386:24.55]I was going to say something about it.
[386:26.17]The poll was... Never mind.
[386:29.41]You already got it.
[386:30.99]You already said the thing that I was going to accidentally say on camera.
[386:36.52]On stream.
[386:37.08]I feel like the alternate reality where I played this and did sniper, I think I would equally enjoy it.
[386:49.74]Hey, watch this for a flip.
[386:53.06]Yep.
[387:06.00]No.
[387:07.16]Oh, I got trapped.
[387:09.16]I actually got trapped.
[387:12.35]Too many big guys.
[387:13.03]Look at these big guys.
[387:13.73]They're just like too many of them.
[387:23.58]And now there's a super big guy.
[387:29.06]The worst.
[387:49.44]good I really would have popped by now oh my god what the dude
[388:43.63]Just getting too close.
[388:54.95]I can't even get the money.
[388:59.81]Oh, that's not good.
[389:00.63]Goodbye.
[389:13.52]You still have your WoW subscription?
[389:14.80]I do.
[389:17.78]I still do want to play it.
[389:18.74]I really do.
[389:23.37]What am I missing here from my life to get to level 30?
[389:26.05]Want money?
[389:40.79]There's new weapons you unlocked in the bottom row.
[389:45.02]Oh man, flame edge?
[389:50.38]What is this thing?
[389:51.12]This is a flaming sword?
[389:52.72]I just got an achievement for that.
[389:58.47]Wait a minute.
[389:59.27]Should I just upgrade it a bunch of times?
[390:07.10]Is that better than a katana?
[390:23.93]Shit.
[390:24.19]Well, I have to try the flame edge.
[390:33.30]Put it on your two.
[390:34.04]Your shotgun sucks.
[390:36.26]It actually does.
[390:38.40]I don't know why I'm so attached to the shotgun.
[390:40.30]It's terrible right now.
[390:41.92]Like level two.
[390:43.74]What level?
[390:44.10]What is it?
[390:44.42]Level... I don't even know.
[390:48.90]Ah, this thing is... And it burns?
[390:55.93]I know what I know.
[390:56.75]I know what I know.
[391:17.66]It's fast too.
[391:18.73]I think the katana is still better right now.
[391:25.62]Yeah, Katana's still better.
[391:30.00]Eventually probably better though.
[391:41.09]my upgrades I have melee damage all the way up I have melee leech all the way up and I have precision a little bit health and I upgraded the katana as many times as I possibly could it's plus six and I just got I got actually the health as well actually this is not good I can't really pop the big guys mage blade freezes you just need to get you need to find the last two z coins
[392:14.78]That's a massive cleave.
[392:21.68]This thing is... Is this better than the katana?
[392:27.59]Tiny range, but who cares?
[392:31.84]You can pop the boomers with the flame dot now.
[392:35.12]Oh yeah, we're going all in on this.
[392:53.71]I didn't even think about the dot popping the boomers.
[393:02.17]There's a secret entrance in the sewers.
[393:03.55]You can go down there and get a Titanite shard.
[393:05.95]That's from a different video game, but forget it.
[393:14.44]Does the dot heal?
[393:16.56]Maybe it does.
[393:17.10]Alright, let's see.
[393:17.58]Hold on.
[393:17.76]Alright.
[393:25.36]It would pop them, but I have to do enough damage before it pops.
[393:32.94]And now it might pop if I hit it.
[393:35.80]That's scary.
[393:46.75]I think that's a little scary.
[393:51.13]They don't blow up either, which is kind of not great.
[394:15.01]Wait, I don't have to worry about popping them because they they're just a regular enemy now.
[394:22.22]That's right.
[394:22.78]OK, so that's way better.
[394:24.32]This thing is going to be crazy when I OK.
[394:35.11]I know I said that was my last break.
[394:38.15]But that might have been a lie.
[394:43.64]Because I think I kind of want to see this through.
[394:45.22]Wait, why did that blow up?
[394:48.46]Why did that blow up?
[394:49.90]He was on fire.
[394:50.60]Somebody explain that to me.
[395:07.81]It's because it's raining?
[395:09.83]Does that actually put the fire out?
[395:11.15]No.
[395:24.87]I'm just gonna sell every item that falls, except for maybe a sniper if one drops.
[395:37.76]If this thing has even one or two more upgrades, it's gonna be destructive.
[395:59.18]Nice.
[395:59.46]Are you sponsored to play this?
[396:04.80]No.
[396:06.30]No, I'm not.
[396:10.64]I am not.
[396:23.01]I'm getting a little cocky though.
[396:26.13]Just relying on the heal to come through every time.
[396:28.13]It kind of does.
[396:33.04]Dude, this is such a good leech film.
[396:52.20]Let's get some more coffee.
[396:53.30]No.
[396:56.25]Two coffees at 8 and then 11 o'clock at night.
[397:01.98]I'm not doing a third coffee yet.
[397:04.22]What is it?
[397:04.72]Like 1130?
[397:05.46]No way.
[397:06.98]That would be a bad idea.
[397:14.32]Shit.
[397:15.72]Oh, disaster strikes.
[397:16.60]I don't know how I made it out of that, but I did.
[397:21.76]Sometimes they do just pop.
[397:22.98]That's weird.
[397:47.32]Give me something good.
[397:59.39]Okay, that looks kind of good, whatever it is.
[398:00.91]Get the money.
[398:14.28]Actually, I'm going to put... Yeah.
[398:16.42]Let's use it.
[398:34.09]Oh shit.
[398:37.17]There's so much money over there.
[398:38.21]Please don't get get it, get it, get it, get it.
[398:40.59]Come on, what are you thinking?
[398:44.82]OK, good.
[398:49.98]Fuck off.
[398:51.78]Why are you popping?
[399:03.40]What just happened?
[399:05.42]Where did it go?
[399:07.12]Where's my weapon?
[399:09.10]Where's my weapon?
[399:11.66]Did I sell... I sold it?
[399:13.92]How did I sell it?
[399:14.96]I dropped it and then sold it?
[399:18.73]No, I did not.
[399:23.21]What?
[399:24.35]How did I do... It would Z to... I have no idea what I just did.
[399:27.87]Well, that's alright.
[399:31.40]Alright, it's 22, 5...
[399:36.29]This is elemental.
[399:38.59]Hold on.
[399:49.27]Is there an elemental damage one?
[399:50.79]Are these the only two elemental?
[400:08.53]Oh no, I think that's it.
[400:10.66]I think it's this one here, yeah.
[400:18.94]Next to the sniper.
[400:21.40]Whoa, holy shit.
[400:23.04]That was like a YouTuber.
[400:24.36]Whoa, that was a YouTube video.
[400:26.06]Whoa, but that's actually insane.
[400:32.50]I thought that was for bazookas or missiles.
[400:39.30]Alright, well now this is going to get really interesting.
[400:41.86]I guess flamethrowers, we've only seen one or two of those.
[400:57.10]Just sell it.
[401:14.20]I can probably start harder, right?
[401:15.76]I think I've upgraded enough.
[401:17.80]I actually like the progression in this game.
[401:32.07]It's been fun.
[401:37.29]Kind of a little drip feed of stuff to do.
[401:54.35]The stream is a good 30 seconds behind mobile?
[402:01.68]Is that actually a thing?
[402:12.46]This is definitely doing way more damage, that's for sure.
[402:26.25]Using the official Twitch app.
[402:27.88]Yeah, isn't the official Twitch app... They don't even work?
[402:30.40]It's dog shit.
[402:40.61]Yeah.
[402:52.82]The notifications don't work either.
[402:54.32]I remember that was a big problem on YouTube for a while.
[403:07.66]How many old YouTube heads are here?
[403:11.71]Where a video would get uploaded and it just would not go into the sub box.
[403:16.81]That was always infuriating.
[403:19.25]Because there was nothing you could do about it.
[403:21.13]Maybe reupload the video, but back in the day, uploading one of those Team Fortress 2 videos, if it was like a 15 minute long or a 20 minute long live commentary or something, sometimes it would take like three to four hours to do that.
[403:37.10]That's back when fiber internet was not real.
[403:42.19]It was nowhere.
[403:42.81]I think back then I had
[403:48.59]It was like 50 down and maybe 5 up, maybe?
[403:53.09]5 megabits per second up, by the way.
[403:58.01]Maybe 3 up?
[403:58.39]It was like 2.5 to 3 up.
[403:59.43]And you couldn't get more than that.
[404:01.75]All the companies did not allow it.
[404:03.31]You couldn't do it.
[404:06.25]I remember being so pissed off about that.
[404:07.85]I was like, why can it be 50 down but not 50 up?
[404:14.61]It's the same fucking cord.
[404:16.11]That's what I thought.
[404:22.64]But yeah, having to take a video down and reupload it was an entire day ordeal.
[404:29.91]And sometimes your video will get stuck in processing, and it wouldn't even work, so you'd have to do it again anyways.
[404:35.93]Some of those videos that you've seen, a lot of them, were like 16-hour ordeals just to get it uploaded and processed to the fucking website.
[404:55.60]Yeah, somebody said, those are the dark ages.
[404:57.48]They really were.
[404:58.06]It's crazy just how much different it is.
[405:01.12]You could just have... I could open my phone up right now, fart into the microphone and into the camera, and it would be on every single platform in literally less than one second.
[405:13.65]That was... That was impossible.
[405:18.31]It was genuinely not possible.
[405:24.96]Or, I think Stirr talked about this too.
[405:28.20]You would upload a video.
[405:29.64]You'd spend three, four days on it, whatever.
[405:32.34]A lot of those videos, sometimes it was a day, sometimes it was two days, whatever it was.
[405:35.51]Or sometimes it was like a couple hours.
[405:37.35]It varied a lot.
[405:39.35]You would put a bunch of shit together.
[405:40.67]I used Premiere.
[405:42.29]Premiere was what I used all through my young adult life.
[405:47.20]I thought it was the best program out of them all.
[405:51.34]and you would accidentally, it'd be like a 10 minute video with a bunch of edits and a bunch of cuts or whatever and they'd be one frame of black and you would want to fucking throw yourself off the roof of your house like no, no it can't be there can't be a black frame here
[406:20.05]I didn't move the... I didn't move the bar over to the left an extra... I missed it.
[406:26.06]How did I miss it?
[406:26.72]And you watched it 10 times in a row.
[406:31.20]You just didn't catch it.
[406:32.34]And then do you live with having the one black frame?
[406:37.60]Or do you reupload the whole thing because you're a perfectionist weirdo?
[406:41.55]That's what I did.
[406:43.93]If I... because you had to publish it.
[406:49.70]A lot of those videos, they didn't get automatically, they were unlisted because you wanted to get to 720p or 480p first.
[406:56.74]Because you didn't want to publish at 360.
[406:58.30]So you'd catch it and be like, well, fuck my life.
[407:06.95]We're going again.
[407:10.93]Imagine doing that for a $10 million movie.
[407:13.98]I'm sure it happens all the time.
[407:19.14]Yeah, you hit render on the latest Pixar movie.
[407:25.59]And there's like a black frame in the middle of it.
[407:30.05]Don't those movies take like three weeks to render?
[407:35.39]Oh, that's got to be.
[407:36.94]No way.
[407:37.58]We wonder why a movie gets delayed or like a show or something.
[407:46.75]Yeah, we had two black frames in the middle of the swamp scene in Shrek.
[407:52.82]They can take years to render sometimes.
[407:55.56]That's wild.
[407:57.71]Really?
[408:02.37]Toy Story took days per frame at a time.
[408:09.34]Dude, art is suffering.
[408:10.75]Can I just tell you?
[408:13.07]Art is suffering.
[408:14.67]If you didn't suffer for your art, I don't know if you did it.
[408:22.19]Can you imagine being in that position where it's just like you're rendering something for three days?
[408:31.70]And it's just like, you just want to pull all your hair out.
[408:33.94]All your follicles want to come out at the same time.
[408:35.86]Because it's just like, fuck, man.
[408:38.28]Shrek's teeth are in wrong.
[408:39.78]They're backwards.
[408:41.07]His top row is in his bottom row.
[408:43.63]He has top row teeth on his bottom row of teeth right now.
[408:47.71]Fuck, I screw.
[408:48.57]I got to do this all over again.
[409:01.77]Dentures in wrong.
[409:02.67]Remember when they redid the whole Sonic movie?
[409:11.15]Holy shit.
[409:12.50]In like three weeks?
[409:14.78]What the fuck?
[409:19.76]Imagine that board meeting.
[409:20.94]Uh, hey everybody.
[409:24.00]Yeah, we have to redo the whole movie.
[409:27.86]I'd be like, yeah, shut the fuck up, Frank.
[409:30.58]Like, what are you, yeah, we'll redo the whole movie, right?
[409:33.66]Yeah, we gotta redo the whole movie.
[409:34.78]Sonic looks like a fucking werewolf, and people, like, told me, uh, people told me on the internet that I was a fucking moron.
[409:41.25]Sonic looks like shit, and, uh, I didn't figure this out until literally 15 minutes ago.
[409:47.59]Some, some egg avatar on Twitter told me that, uh, I was a piece of shit, and that, uh, my whole family fucking suffers, and, uh, I didn't realize it until right now.
[410:07.27]And it's just like, oh, and then on top of that too, it's like, yeah, hey Frank, you know, we were telling you that Sonic looks like a werewolf for like the last two years.
[410:15.13]Right, right, but it was just one egg avatar on Twitter that like really fucking got me thinking about it.
[410:20.29]Not anybody, not all these people that I respect.
[410:27.08]Uh, I'm in trouble.
[410:36.27]I just healed all that back though.
[410:37.55]Hold on.
[410:37.87]I think we're good.
[410:55.12]Go get them stuffed in here.
[410:57.41]One at a time.
[410:57.89]Uh oh.
[410:58.99]That's it.
[411:03.60]There's a story about Donkey Kong Country where the power company ended up calling Rare because of how much, what, how much power they were using?
[411:10.45]Hold on, is that real?
[411:16.19]How much power their rendering computers were using?
[411:18.51]Holy shit.
[411:23.59]That's funny.
[411:24.07]Alright, this is plus four.
[411:28.63]30,000 for plus...
[411:35.63]Actually, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[411:38.29]There we go.
[411:39.11]I can start way higher now.
[411:40.45]Perfect.
[411:52.46]Yeah, the amount of shit that you got to go through to kind of make something, right?
[412:19.31]But I think about it too sometimes about how the rise of kind of AI, right?
[412:24.11]I don't know.
[412:27.49]I feel like I want to.
[412:32.76]You know, if you don't cry at least one time on a big project, like, I don't know.
[412:51.15]You gotta suffer.
[412:55.42]I think it's mainly that you can kind of... Because, I mean, we all know, right?
[413:01.72]We all know that people that make anything, and it doesn't matter what it is.
[413:07.55]Like, blood, sweat, and tears kind of went into that.
[413:10.81]And you can almost, like, you can really feel it.
[413:19.20]Now, there's also to think about, like, how much stuff have we made?
[413:21.94]We've made so many things as human beings.
[413:26.87]We've made millions of hours of stuff, of content, of books, and TV shows, and games, and paintings, and art, and there's so much shit that we've made as human beings.
[413:45.57]And people are still making them.
[413:48.08]That's remarkable.
[413:49.56]Music!
[413:49.92]Look at this music!
[413:53.52]We're just media-loving ants, yeah?
[414:04.85]And I know I've heard the argument that like AI is a tool, right?
[414:09.12]Instead of a creative engine as a tool for a creative person, I've heard those arguments.
[414:20.71]Like if you draw something and you work a bunch on something and you use AI to kind of help with the shit that you really don't want to do, which is, you know, like cleanup or... I've heard it.
[414:38.48]But I don't know.
[414:39.26]I think I like the... Whenever I make something, I kind of want it to be like, oh, I got to fucking go through this.
[415:06.44]And like, don't get me wrong.
[415:07.52]Oh, yeah, I've absolutely laughed at and I've absolutely been like, you know what?
[415:11.00]Yeah, show me.
[415:12.20]I'm going to say this.
[415:12.92]I've said this a thousand times.
[415:14.27]Yeah, show me Elmo on the set of Friends.
[415:16.13]And he's in a suit and shit.
[415:17.19]And like the AI just makes like a fucking weird Elmo.
[415:21.63]I that's funny.
[415:22.63]It's fucking we've laughed on this stream and shown pretty funny, creative AI shit that people have made of like me doing something.
[415:38.03]And some of the AI video stuff, but it's kind of... I don't know.
[415:43.47]Like, how do you put a cap on something like that?
[415:45.14]Like, how do you actually say, alright, well, that's enough.
[415:48.48]Yeah.
[415:49.56]Having, like...
[415:51.87]Uh, Celebrity X, um, on the Muppet Show, eat food Y, uh, while they play the piano.
[416:03.48]Like, uh, okay, like, you can't, I guess you can't really put it back in the bag, right?
[416:09.18]It's hard.
[416:20.27]medical stuff for ai right like think about some of those some of the research and some of the could you could an ai just kind of figure out a ton of just like a trillion miles a second on proteins and I don't know maybe like I think that's that that's a kind of a big deal they actually did that too by the way damn yeah
[416:52.92]And then, yeah, but there's like electricity.
[416:54.52]How much electricity is it used to do it?
[416:56.52]There's a lot on that.
[416:59.35]And I am not the person that can tell you exactly what should or shouldn't be.
[417:04.71]It's getting very interesting and it's getting kind of scary at the same time.
[417:16.95]yeah in a world where we have a lot of diseases and a lot of things that could really use the collective brain power of a computer like thousands or hundreds of thousands of them to figure out how to actually cure a disease
[417:58.79]But like I said, it's tricky because the cat's kind of already out of the bag and.
[418:05.64]I'm sure we'll be seeing more of it and doing using it in places.
[418:10.74]Maybe you didn't even think you were.
[418:14.44]I just want to see people make paintings.
[418:16.70]I just want to see people make TV shows and movies and books and stuff still.
[418:22.01]And I'm sure this stuff will still happen, right?
[418:23.51]It's not like it will go away, but...
[418:49.03]I just said I want to fuck chat GPT.
[418:52.95]Well, give it a few more years, dude.
[418:57.41]You'll probably be able to.
[419:11.09]This little sword is crazy.
[419:12.49]Yeah, it really is.
[419:15.18]Nobody said that.
[419:15.92]Yes, they did.
[419:16.80]Scroll up.
[419:17.40]Just use your scroll wheel.
[419:18.40]You'll see it.
[419:35.39]I'll never use AI.
[419:36.54]I want to suffer.
[419:55.68]I don't know.
[419:56.21]I feel like that was a funny connection there.
[420:01.45]Who are you talking to?
[420:03.01]I'm about to PB and you fucked it up.
[420:07.03]And that's how you get yourself a timeout.
[420:09.66]Click.
[420:11.24]Click.
[420:12.56]Okay.
[420:13.56]There you go.
[420:20.29]Hey, I did get a PB, didn't I?
[420:27.86]I bet you doing the fire damage is actually probably just better.
[420:30.16]It's probably more bang for your buck.
[420:34.90]I need like a dollar.
[420:38.35]No, I wanted to steal it from here and put it in here.
[420:40.91]Time to go again.
[420:59.18]Who are you talking to for real though?
[421:01.80]Somebody in chat said something.
[421:04.98]Guys, there's 150,000 people here right now.
[421:08.91]I add a zero to make myself feel better.
[421:12.47]It's like almost 200,000 people here.
[421:13.91]There was over a million people here today.
[421:24.98]Sorry, I didn't see your message.
[421:55.69]Do you remember back, it feels like ages ago, where I was freaking out to try to get to level 10 and you guys were betting on if I was going to get there or not?
[422:08.73]Some of you lost a lot of channel points at this moment right here.
[422:33.34]Oh, that's too bad.
[422:43.87]I am so addicted to this game.
[422:45.15]It's so fun.
[422:46.52]I can't stop playing this.
[422:48.66]I think I'm getting soon.
[422:49.62]It'll happen soon though.
[422:50.56]Maybe one more break and I'll try to get... I gotta get to level 30.
[423:09.87]We'll see.
[423:18.66]Can you make a bet I didn't gamble last time?
[423:20.48]Nah, nah.
[423:26.40]These are the chilled out hours.
[423:42.62]Any chance of seeing the mage blade today?
[423:47.98]Is it just if I just unlock two more people?
[423:52.00]I guess I could go find.
[423:52.76]I might as well just actually go try to find.
[423:56.65]The other two coins.
[424:03.08]all 40 coins oh I only have 17 or 18 of them so probably not I could go searching but I don't think I'm gonna get 20 in the next like 30 40 minutes
[424:33.40]Don't you have 38 out of 40?
[424:36.36]I don't think so.
[424:39.44]Wait, do I?
[424:49.28]I forgot about Pizza Tower.
[424:50.30]That was a great game.
[424:55.63]Is there a place I can see?
[425:12.30]Their next game is going to be a beat-em-up.
[425:15.20]Oh, they're actually working on something new.
[425:16.79]Cool.
[425:35.47]Is it in the same universe or is it a completely different game altogether?
[425:39.35]Or universe altogether, I should say.
[425:57.06]Missed a coin?
[425:57.56]I'll get it.
[426:01.34]Where is it?
[426:03.52]How did I miss it?
[426:04.02]Where is it?
[426:06.68]Coin?
[426:07.20]Where's the coin?
[426:13.04]Down?
[426:21.53]Oh, there you go.
[426:21.99]Yep.
[426:26.65]Oh no, that hurt.
[426:32.40]Get out of here.
[426:34.82]Yeah, said not at 19.
[426:40.11]I pretty far.
[426:40.95]There's a lot more points to get.
[426:54.86]Actually kind of a strategy here.
[426:55.98]Look at this.
[426:57.99]Just get stuck on the wall.
[427:25.31]This is the last time you howled for the pack.
[427:28.57]Last time I howled, the pack said, don't ever do that again.
[427:31.97]That was a terrible howl.
[427:34.84]Leave that to our howler.
[427:38.80]And now we have one guy that does it.
[427:44.18]Yeah, I got booed on the stage at the furry convention.
[427:46.08]Like, I don't even know how that's possible, by the way.
[428:03.69]And I just kept screaming, you don't know real art.
[428:06.04]You don't know real art.
[428:24.12]And I said, yeah, can an AI do this?
[428:26.52]I tried to do a cartwheel during the booze.
[428:30.17]And my foot kicked the back of a speaker that was behind me.
[428:34.91]And it fucking shattered my ankle.
[428:37.55]And I ended up falling back.
[428:38.65]The stage behind it was like a platform I fell down.
[428:47.47]I don't know why I would, I would just start saying that for no reason.
[428:50.49]Like, no.
[428:53.27]Why would I bring up AI?
[428:54.39]I don't know.
[429:13.42]Ow.
[429:15.04]No!
[429:17.55]I need 30,000 at least.
[429:29.96]That looks pretty good, whatever it is.
[429:31.70]1200 gold.
[429:43.12]This could be the third level 30.
[429:44.16]This could be it.
[429:46.80]It will definitely be the next one.
[429:48.42]Why am I talking?
[429:49.46]Why am I talking?
[429:52.86]That leech just saved everything.
[429:55.08]Yeah, they're starting to hit really hard now.
[430:10.71]This is with only one health upgrade too.
[430:19.41]Because I can upgrade this one more time.
[430:24.57]Uh-oh.
[430:24.89]Come on, 40k.
[430:27.17]Come on.
[430:27.63]40,000.
[430:27.67]Do it.
[430:42.34]Get out of the backyard?
[430:43.42]I mean, it's kind of working, though.
[430:46.66]Like, I'm kind of doing crazy.
[431:10.22]Like I was a little too hard, but hey 40K I'm good.
[431:12.74]26.
[431:20.67]Alright, this is this thing is now.
[431:27.35]That's a lot.
[431:28.05]This is plus 5.
[431:28.67]21 for that.
[431:33.91]A OK.
[431:37.60]alright this will be this will be the last break after this I'm gonna I'll do one or two more runs I think maybe let's we'll see I really do want to try to get to level 30. I'll see you guys in let's call it five minutes
[432:04.62]And we'll end after this, like a half hour, 45 minutes or so.
[436:18.84]How we doing?
[436:21.32]Okay.
[436:21.48]Hold on, let me move this.
[436:26.12]Oh, shit.
[436:26.72]I thought I muted.
[436:29.32]Glad I didn't grab the top of this.
[436:30.85]I thought I hit the mute button.
[436:37.85]That's better.
[436:40.95]Alright.
[436:42.39]What about my last few runs to look like here?
[436:47.80]I want to Max this out.
[436:49.70]OK, I need this to get to Max.
[436:51.33]I need this to get to at least one more.
[436:57.13]And then I should be able to get to 30.
[436:58.17]I think.
[437:03.41]Hold the money.
[437:03.83]I'm gonna hold the money.
[437:07.73]What do I need?
[437:08.17]How much?
[437:08.43]How much do I need?
[437:11.87]I don't think I can afford to do this again. 21.
[437:21.03]Like 30?
[437:21.45]I need like 30,000 more.
[437:33.36]Oh shit, the upgrade to get more money with melee.
[437:48.08]Yeah, at this point I kind of went all in on the fire.
[437:50.08]So I'm just selling everything that I see.
[437:51.72]Are you the type of guy that would snore loudly at the sleepover at like 2am?
[438:01.23]No, no, I do not snore.
[438:03.61]Snoring is not... I'm a very quiet sleeper.
[438:09.39]I kind of just don't move and just sit there like a rock.
[438:23.13]But I am also a very light sleeper.
[438:25.43]If a pin drops anywhere in the room or anywhere, it doesn't matter.
[438:33.75]I'm like, what's that?
[438:34.35]Something's out there.
[438:36.29]What's that?
[438:48.91]You've seen what your sleep looks like.
[438:51.85]Yeah, that's one.
[438:52.55]That's one like jokey meme picture.
[439:01.76]That picture is so stupid.
[439:12.05]I'm already at level 10 damn.
[439:24.07]I need... I'm going for 50,000.
[439:26.05]And then the next thing after 50k will be my... My next run will be my last one.
[439:32.69]Because I got to get some food.
[439:35.38]I'm hungry.
[439:37.40]I ate right before the stream.
[439:38.48]I made sure to.
[439:39.08]Because I knew this was going to go kind of longer and into the night.
[439:46.54]But it's about that time again.
[440:02.04]I'd love to see a Battleheart Legacy remake.
[440:05.06]I would play... You want to talk about a stream that I would play that all day?
[440:16.46]I might even... Who cares?
[440:18.26]Like, I might even just play it anyways.
[440:19.55]Play the original.
[440:25.59]Who cares?
[440:37.12]Absolutely shredding.
[440:55.35]Pickle Pounder.
[441:02.73]I thought that somebody in chat just made that up.
[441:06.61]That could have been your video too.
[441:09.57]Probably wasn't, but it could have been.
[441:24.26]I should be selling more of these things.
[441:26.06]Ow.
[441:30.75]Alright, dude.
[441:31.89]Can we not die?
[441:32.87]This is not even close to my PB.
[441:55.28]How far can I spit?
[441:59.00]I don't think I've ever measured that.
[442:03.09]Honestly, probably pretty far.
[442:23.26]I'm not going to lie.
[442:23.98]I just was playing with one hand for a sec and can't do that at these high levels.
[442:30.34]He thinks it's high level.
[442:32.30]Okay.
[442:50.63]Hey, do you got, you're making like a, oh, he's a zerk and off joke.
[443:00.65]Do you remember the description for the pancake recipe video?
[443:03.93]Is it even still there?
[443:04.66]I don't know what made me think about this.
[443:13.95]I remember writing that description and saying, I think Ster and I were just laughing at it.
[443:21.03]I was like, should I just have this be the description?
[443:23.05]I'm like, okay, who cares?
[443:29.78]Somebody go get it.
[443:31.32]Somebody paste it in here.
[443:52.48]Uh, okay, master.
[443:54.96]Yeah, that's my minions.
[444:20.74]And he's 50,000.
[444:23.21]50,000?
[444:23.41]Or else.
[444:46.06]Ow!
[444:49.34]Oh no, this is the or else part.
[444:50.68]I'm in trouble.
[444:55.07]Oh, fuck you.
[444:56.67]Why?
[444:57.07]That guy, it's the same guy.
[444:58.61]Just like the super eat thing.
[444:59.79]Whatever, I got it.
[445:05.03]Is 26 or 27 the new wall?
[445:09.90]A 21, what?
[445:12.00]Are you kidding me?
[445:13.64]Awful.
[445:14.80]What a terrible display.
[445:20.02]Alright.
[445:21.79]That's maxed out.
[445:23.27]All the melee is maxed out.
[445:33.01]That's more healing, that's true, yeah.
[445:34.91]Did he just switch to Goth Girl?
[445:47.20]What about... What about Pirate Girl?
[445:49.04]I feel like this weapon is more suited to Pirate Girl.
[446:09.84]Alright, this might be the last one.
[446:11.54]Make it count.
[446:12.32]If I don't get to 50,000, then it's over.
[446:16.22]I need $50,000 or I'm done.
[446:21.85]I don't mean in the game, by the way.
[446:29.50]I'm kidding.
[446:30.20]I'm kidding.
[447:07.86]You still live?
[447:08.62]Yeah, I told you.
[447:11.86]It took me 10 seconds in this game to tell you I was very upfront that I was going to become obsessed with this game.
[447:18.91]I just knew it or I knew it was going to happen.
[447:22.51]I tried to be transparent with you.
[447:24.89]I tried.
[447:27.49]You didn't listen.
[447:44.14]What are you going to do when you're actually done with streaming?
[447:45.98]What will you do?
[447:46.92]Star in life alert ads?
[447:48.18]I mean, kind of cool.
[447:55.95]I don't know.
[448:04.87]I want to travel.
[448:08.14]I have not seen the world at all.
[448:11.25]And I mean at all.
[448:13.59]I've never left North America once.
[448:16.33]Ever.
[448:18.61]And I want to do that.
[448:19.83]I want to do some traveling.
[448:20.87]I want to... I don't know.
[448:25.40]I kind of want to see the world.
[448:29.44]And I've not done that yet.
[448:30.58]And I'm... It's not that I'm getting old, but...
[448:36.60]While I'm still hip and with it, I'd like to at least go to Europe and Asia and South America.
[448:47.46]Australia.
[448:48.20]There's a lot of places I really want to go.
[449:01.46]But it wouldn't be like a content thing.
[449:03.87]Like, oh, I want to go stream in Korea or something.
[449:07.75]Or stream in Australia.
[449:09.57]No, I just would want to go enjoy it.
[449:12.89]Take in the culture.
[449:29.26]Would I ever just see you on the streets of Japan?
[449:33.75]I mean, maybe.
[449:35.75]One day, I don't know.
[449:36.89]It's probably very, very unlikely, but... I've talked to CDawg about it.
[449:51.58]CDawg was, um, asking about, like, if I would ever want to do something like that.
[449:55.96]Just even just come and hang out and stuff.
[449:57.92]This is a bowl.
[449:58.36]This is a bowl.
[449:59.24]I could TwitchCon a year or two ago.
[450:04.03]And I said the same thing.
[450:04.75]I was like, yeah, I do.
[450:10.72]I do.
[450:11.08]I really do.
[450:21.63]But I don't know.
[450:22.23]It's got to be at the right time.
[450:23.33]It is just not the right time right now.
[450:26.43]I don't know when it will be.
[450:31.64]But you know, it's never the right time, isn't it?
[450:36.65]That's something I'm kind of learning.
[450:39.27]It's never the right time.
[450:42.97]So you kind of have to decide it's the right time.
[450:53.30]We'll see.
[450:55.31]Maybe next year or something.
[450:57.51]2025 I want to be the year of getting back to normal.
[451:03.77]Not that it was abnormal really last year.
[451:08.81]But it kind of was.
[451:09.49]So that's my goal.
[451:11.81]My goal for this year is to get back into the swing of things.
[451:16.39]Get back to kind of normal.
[451:24.65]last year was very abnormal it yeah it's still everything is still kind of abnormal but I think it'll be alright I think in the next year or two get my head screwed on but it was coming loose but it was coming loose it was
[452:09.61]Not enough for it to be unscrewed, but enough for it to be like, what the fuck, man?
[452:13.91]Dermot, is it true that you have a physical copy of Concord?
[452:34.63]Concord's bad per day?
[452:37.39]Yeah, dude, I got that shit on N64.
[452:54.67]No, I don't have a physical copy of Conquered.
[452:57.27]I don't.
[453:00.70]I didn't even know that game came out until people talked shit about it.
[453:03.60]I didn't even know it came out.
[453:08.48]I just heard, hey, this game sucks.
[453:09.88]And I was like, oh, I didn't buy it and I wasn't going to.
[453:37.67]Yeah, that's all I knew about it was.
[453:40.44]Hey dude, hey, did you hear this?
[453:41.66]This game fucking sucks.
[453:44.36]Oh shit.
[453:45.44]Oh, alright.
[453:53.52]I can't die here.
[453:54.22]I'm at almost a PB.
[454:03.61]That guy's killed me almost every time and I just got him.
[454:05.54]PB incoming.
[454:08.83]Not kidding around.
[454:37.54]Or the game wasn't that bad, just another saturated hero shooter.
[454:40.90]Way too, yeah.
[454:43.64]Yeah, I don't know.
[454:44.20]I don't know why game companies do this.
[454:46.56]And I, who knows?
[454:49.72]But like when you, when you like start chasing trends seven years after the trend starts, I don't think you're chasing a trend anymore.
[454:57.56]I don't think that's the trend.
[455:02.18]It takes about five years for a trend to go through its entire cycle.
[455:16.87]This happened with MOBAs, too.
[455:18.01]There was a MOBA coming out, it seems like, after League and Dota.
[455:22.71]Three, four, five years later, it's like, what about this one?
[455:25.21]We're doing it, too.
[455:25.97]And it's like, well, I'm kind of... I don't... And the thing about a trend, and this is another thing about trends, you usually like the one that you like and the one that you already play.
[455:36.90]And first movers, actually, there's a lot to that.
[455:40.66]So if League of Legends has 100 billion people playing it, they kind of want to play League.
[455:46.34]They don't want to play this other League.
[455:53.87]Some of them were pretty good.
[455:55.65]Somebody just mentioned it.
[455:57.79]Han, right?
[455:58.49]Han was... People loved that game.
[456:04.41]That was pretty... That was there pretty early, though.
[456:07.90]I don't know if that was a trend chaser.
[456:09.20]I think that was there for a long time.
[456:15.61]Han was around.
[456:16.15]Yeah, Heroes of the North.
[456:16.91]It was around for a long time.
[456:24.62]Yeah, Han was before Dota.
[456:26.20]Dota 2 at least, yeah.
[456:30.06]I liked Han because the click delay... One of the reasons why I never played MOBA is why I think they're... I'm sorry.
[456:35.90]Here's a real take for you.
[456:38.44]I'm sorry.
[456:38.92]This is a take.
[456:39.92]You're going to get a take out of me tonight.
[456:41.90]I think I don't like the click top-down MOBAs.
[456:44.49]I fucking hate them.
[456:45.77]I just don't... I don't fuck with them at all.
[456:47.91]I don't care about them at all.
[456:50.05]That's a take.
[456:50.97]Uh-oh.
[456:51.95]Shit.
[456:52.21]What I meant to say was those games are very fun, and they're very interesting, and people like them, and...
[456:58.55]But the reason why is not because the game is bad.
[457:02.25]Hold on, I'm speedy territory here.
[457:06.37]I think those games are probably very, there's a reason why people play them, right?
[457:10.77]My problem was I really hate click delay.
[457:15.25]I don't like clicking to move and a tenth of a half a second later, it's affirmative and they turn around and run.
[457:23.00]Han had almost no click delay.
[457:29.32]And I remember being like, holy shit, really?
[457:32.33]One of these doesn't have a click, uh, even, even a millisecond drives me insane.
[457:37.33]And that was almost 30.
[457:44.68]It's latency too, but yeah, but I remember, I remember trying Han and it was, you would click and it was almost instant.
[457:59.45]In recent years, it doesn't bother me as much as it did before, but... Oh, it bothered me before.
[458:03.95]I couldn't do it.
[458:06.59]I also don't like last-hitting creeps.
[458:08.99]I think it's... It's just... I hate it.
[458:12.86]I just hate it.
[458:13.20]That's why I liked Smite, because Smite was like... And Heroes of the Storm, too.
[458:18.48]You didn't really have to do that in Heroes of the Storm or Smite.
[458:27.59]I understand why people play them and why people really like them.
[458:32.03]Okay, we're doing 30% more damage now.
[458:34.57]Okay, this is definitely a PB incoming.
[458:36.05]This is it, Raider.
[458:54.38]But I guess the point with that is...
[458:57.42]league of legends comes out dominates the whole world dominates the whole market and I guess people thought they could rip even and this is why they do it if you even get one percent of league's player base you are set for life but league they want to play league they don't want to play champions of the fortress it's like I want to play league of legends that's why I'm playing it I like league
[459:32.83]And learning a new game like that, it can take hundreds, if not thousands and thousands and thousands of hours to even be ready to play those games.
[459:45.95]Are you going to jump from League after putting 10,000 hours into it?
[459:49.59]To Champions of the Fortress?
[459:54.07]At zero?
[459:54.59]I don't know.
[459:56.75]I don't really play those games, but I imagine not really.
[460:07.49]You could play both.
[460:10.17]That's a lot of commitment though.
[460:21.61]Hey, do you have an air fryer?
[460:22.86]No, but I like that.
[460:24.22]That's a good question though.
[460:26.90]League is fun.
[460:27.48]It's just not fun.
[460:28.62]Yeah, I get it.
[460:30.44]I get it.
[460:30.86]Trust me.
[460:41.12]There is something really, really fun about...
[460:44.58]Oh, yeah.
[460:45.06]I'm queuing up.
[460:45.85]I'm going to queue up a jungle.
[460:47.57]Yep.
[460:48.27]Hey.
[460:48.77]Hey.
[460:49.95]I'm the jungler.
[460:50.75]We're jungler guys.
[460:51.93]You know?
[460:52.81]I'm a jungler.
[460:54.13]Hey, we're mid guys.
[460:55.19]I'm a mid guy.
[460:57.32]I get it.
[460:58.40]Yeah, that's what I do.
[460:59.46]That's my role.
[461:00.88]Hey, I'm a solo laner.
[461:04.02]That's what I do.
[461:05.20]Hey, that's what I do.
[461:07.82]And this champion?
[461:09.37]You think this champion sucks?
[461:10.99]I solo lane that champion.
[461:12.43]That's what I do.
[461:16.30]It gives an interesting identity to your gaming experience.
[461:27.16]What's the little fucking weird character's name?
[461:33.05]Teemo?
[461:34.13]What's his name?
[461:38.43]Teemo.
[461:38.81]Yeah, if you're a Teemo player,
[461:47.35]I mean, you get made fun of, right?
[461:49.31]You get made fun of.
[461:56.00]I don't know.
[461:56.88]Who knows?
[461:57.24]You might not.
[462:10.08]But that's just what you do.
[462:12.32]And then when some... In the tournaments... Oh yeah, I'm making it to the tournament.
[462:15.97]What'd you ban?
[462:16.55]You banned Teemo?
[462:19.49]Oh, you did that because that's what I do.
[462:23.61]And hey, that's fine.
[462:27.61]I'm gonna play my ult that you didn't even know about and the crowd's gonna go crazy.
[462:31.72]I just picked fucking... Giverio.
[462:37.14]Are you kidding me?
[462:38.04]The crowd goes nuts.
[462:40.58]Dude, nobody plays Giverio.
[462:42.48]That fucking character sucks, but that's what I do.
[462:46.38]I get it.
[462:55.45]Dude, you need an air fryer, bro.
[462:57.27]I don't want an air fryer.
[463:01.95]We use the microwave in this house.
[463:19.57]We use the microwave in this house.
[463:22.77]And I, I put it in there for a minute.
[463:25.81]And when it comes out, half, one side of it is freezing cold and the other side is burning hot.
[463:33.66]That's how I, that's just what I do.
[463:35.42]Okay.
[463:38.51]Yeah, I think about, like, am I gonna get sick by eating the cold part?
[463:42.60]That's what I fucking do.
[463:43.84]So you eat around the cold part, because, like, hey, is this, like, the temperature fine to eat this?
[464:16.13]Hey, I just started WoW.
[464:16.99]I made a troll hunter because I think he was the funniest.
[464:19.31]It's a good pick.
[464:39.57]It's kind of weird because I think... When I was playing Smite,
[464:47.88]I loved Bakasora and that's like why I played the game.
[464:53.18]It really, that game could have been dog shit.
[464:57.08]And it depends on who you ask, they might say it was.
[464:59.97]But I liked it.
[465:01.31]I thought it was a great game.
[465:04.63]But Bakasora was just, he was a little weirdo and he was played not a whole lot though, especially old Bakasora.
[465:11.77]I'm talking the one with the hood up.
[465:16.49]I'm talking like the Little Red Riding Hood Bakasora, you know what I mean?
[465:19.57]But I like that character, I thought it was a cool character.
[465:40.75]And sometimes that's kind of enough.
[465:42.00]Why do you think Team Fortress 2 has survived a hundred years at this point?
[465:50.30]Because interesting characters that people like, sometimes it's all that's needed.
[465:55.59]Sometimes it's all that is required for a game to do well.
[465:57.81]Because, hey, I kind of like these characters.
[466:01.25]They're really fun.
[466:02.13]They're really interesting.
[466:06.01]I think TF2 in particular, like you can, it's easy to relate to like all of them in some way, in play style or in personality.
[466:15.36]It's just like, they're all awesome.
[466:18.94]That's pretty rare that every single one of them is like, wow, this is cool.
[466:21.68]They're all cool.
[466:22.34]I love, I love this game.
[466:25.67]Even the pyro.
[466:26.31]Yeah, of course.
[466:27.07]Yeah.
[466:27.29]Pyro is fucking awesome.
[466:30.71]Silent killing machine.
[466:40.42]Are you kidding me?
[466:45.64]Not silent.
[466:46.14]Well, I'm not.
[466:46.80]I mean, you... We're talking like Kenny from South Park.
[466:51.41]Silent is what I mean.
[466:56.19]There's personality in there.
[466:57.33]You can hear it.
[467:07.21]I can't do it right now.
[467:08.05]It's too late.
[467:08.57]But the scream, you know, the one that... No, my PB.
[467:15.07]I fucking hate it.
[467:20.91]Always a purple one of those guys.
[467:30.44]Alright.
[467:31.58]I'm going to turn into a pumpkin.
[467:34.14]I got to get out of here.
[467:49.61]I will upgrade.
[467:50.43]Oh, I can't.
[467:54.97]Great game though.
[467:57.43]Unironically, this is very fun.
[467:59.83]Highly recommended if you're just looking for something to just grind and just chill.
[468:06.06]This is a great one.
[468:06.60]I like it.
[468:10.24]This is Zombieville USA 3D.
[468:12.20]It's on Steam and it was fun.
[468:15.44]Liked it a lot.
[468:19.93]What is your building going to look like?
[468:23.89]No stream tomorrow.
[468:27.25]Likely stream on Monday or Tuesday.
[468:39.23]Never going to play this again.
[468:42.10]Um, I don't know if I'll stream this again.
[468:43.70]I might still play it though.
[468:47.18]I might get addicted to it.
[468:48.50]You might see this might be the next thing I stream.
[468:52.58]Doubtful, but.
[468:55.32]Never know.
[469:03.27]So I need to save it.
[469:04.23]I think it saves automatically, right?
[469:08.93]Yeah, I think so.
[469:15.92]Was this the default character that does not play with him once?
[469:25.08]You could do the multiplayer.
[469:25.96]The multiplayer actually would be probably pretty fun because the game gets really, really top-heavy, I think.
[469:34.41]And having more people would be fun to kind of clear it with.
[469:37.29]But, yeah, we'll see.
[469:38.65]I enjoyed it tonight, that's for sure.
[469:50.33]Thanks for joining me.
[469:51.89]Thanks for staying up.
[469:53.05]I know somebody probably stayed up pretty late, but... I have an MD in my name like you asked.
[470:02.04]Do I win something?
[470:15.15]You don't win anything.
[470:16.91]You win having a cool name.
[470:28.38]Did you do a Squeaks collab?
[470:32.10]I would play stuff with Squeaks, yeah.
[470:35.12]Like I told you guys before, there's a lot of people I would love to do stuff with, but... You know, when it naturally happens.
[470:49.64]Squeaks is great, yeah.
[470:52.30]I think a lot of people are great on this site.
[470:54.01]I think there's a lot of great streamers.
[470:58.69]Yeah, I'm in my.
[471:00.81]I'm in my when it happens arc.
[471:06.51]And.
[471:06.73]I mean you.
[471:10.65]I'm going to be inviting a lot of people you've seen before for the House Flipper thing so.
[471:17.04]Yeah, no, I love playing stuff with people.
[471:27.92]Cardets are broken?
[471:28.54]That's alright.
[471:34.32]That's been such a cool thing that has been available for years and years and years.
[471:38.83]You gonna finish Split Fiction?
[471:52.46]Yeah.
[471:56.39]Yeah, that's the thing.
[471:57.73]There's a lot of shit to do, right?
[472:11.52]It's hard to play Split Fiction or play WoW or play Dracula 3 when I do Zombieville 3D for eight hours and then not stream for three days.
[472:23.58]That's kind of...
[472:27.64]That's just what it is, though.
[472:28.94]That's what I mean when I say I'm just in my whatever arc.
[472:31.72]I just called it an arc.
[472:34.52]Fringe.
[472:36.46]Yeah, I did.
[472:40.64]Yeah, we'll see.
[472:47.69]Arc's Fatalis.
[472:48.47]I have not forgotten.
[472:49.37]I have not forgotten about it.
[472:51.09]I promise.
[472:55.01]I gotta be in that.
[472:56.27]I gotta be in it to win it.
[473:07.00]But yeah, take care of yourselves.
[473:08.00]Call your mother.
[473:10.82]Tomorrow, not tonight.
[473:12.04]Or maybe it might be two or three o'clock in the afternoon for you.
[473:15.14]Who knows?
[473:15.45]See you later.
[473:19.21]See you in at the minimum, probably like a couple of days, two or three days.
[473:24.89]Looking like a Tuesday-ish or Monday-ish.
[473:30.30]See you soon.
[473:51.86]you
