[00:03.92]The world is veiled in darkness.
[00:07.98]The wind stops, the sea is wild, and the Earth begins to rot.
[00:14.51]The people wait.
[00:16.27]Their only hope, a prophecy.
[00:19.25]When the world is in darkness, four warriors will come.
[00:23.51]But they were late.
[00:25.26]They got stuck in traffic.
[00:30.44]After saving the princess from garlic, I mean, um, I mean Garland... Light warriors, thank you for saving the princess.
[00:43.84]This loot has been passed down from queen to princess for two thousand years.
[00:49.90]So I'm going to break that ongoing tradition and give it to you guys.
[00:53.23]It has no use whatsoever, and is mainly for decoration.
[00:56.83]But please accept it as my gift.
[00:59.17]It just may come in handy.
[01:01.29]But you just said it has no use.
[01:04.25]How could it come in handy?
[01:06.05]It just might, you know.
[01:07.99]Maybe you can use it on your quest.
[01:10.48]Yes, but that's giving it a use.
[01:12.84]If it has no use, then technically it could never really come in handy, now could it?
[01:17.72]Um, well, you know, the funny thing about that one is, well, it's a... GUNS!
[01:30.68]So, this is Matoya's cavern, huh?
[01:35.70]Hmm.
[01:37.38]Somehow I thought it would have been bigger than this.
[01:45.89]Hmm.
[01:47.99]Hmm.
[01:50.89]I am seeing a faint image of a man.
[01:55.49]He... He seems to be beating a squirrel to death with a shovel.
[02:02.82]Oh, God.
[02:03.82]Oh, my God.
[02:05.82]This is horrible.
[02:08.20]You can see the bright... Oh, my God.
[02:10.96]Ooh, shiny.
[02:26.11]Oh my god, I killed that lady.
[02:28.39]OMFG TAPOUNZERS!
[02:36.71]Aye, I be became a pirate, and surprised I am that these curvy dogs have the nerve to face me.
[02:45.85]Now ye must answer one question.
[02:48.88]How many eyepatches do ye see me wearing?
[02:52.64]Um, one.
[02:54.24]What?! !
[03:00.44]Take me ship.
[03:02.21]It's outside of town, you landlubbers.
[03:05.77]Okay, that was easy.
[03:11.87]Light warriors, for five years the prince has slept under Astos' spell.
[03:21.16]Astos has double-crossed us.
[03:23.96]Please go and retrieve the crown he stole from us.
[03:29.32]And bring it back here to me.
[03:32.66]Don't make any pit stops.
[03:35.30]Just straight back to me.
[03:37.84]I get the crown.
[03:40.62]Nobody else.
[03:44.11]Okay.
[03:45.25]Settle down, Spaz.
[03:49.19]Fools!
[03:50.53]Little do they know I am Astos in disguise and that I want them to get me the crown so that I can have ultimate power and stuff like that.
[04:05.12]Um, we haven't left yet.
[04:09.23]Uh... Look, a distraction!
