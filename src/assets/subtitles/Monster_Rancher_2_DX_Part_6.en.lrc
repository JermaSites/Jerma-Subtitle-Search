[00:23.61]Hey, what's up?
[00:26.73]I know it said 5 o'clock Pacific.
[00:32.60]But that's just not what time it is, is it?
[00:36.80]Oh, joy.
[00:40.51]Oh, I'm a dope.
[00:42.35]I meant to write 5 Eastern.
[00:44.67]Oh, dope.
[00:46.50]What's up, though?
[00:50.62]Welcome.
[00:50.82]Welcome.
[00:59.94]Today is going to be a chill day.
[01:01.46]Although I've got some really, really breaking news.
[01:10.29]I got breaking news.
[01:13.70]You heard it here first.
[01:17.39]The Monster Rancher tournament is being moved to Wednesday.
[01:23.54]Because only two of us have monsters trained.
[01:27.02]Uh, I don't think, uh, we don't, we, we need, we don't have, uh, very many people that have three trained monsters.
[01:33.84]And I noticed this, uh, Squeaks was having technical problems.
[01:36.78]The game kept crashing on him.
[01:39.07]So I just said, alright, you know what?
[01:42.87]Uh, let's give a little bit extra time.
[01:46.26]People don't like some people learning how to play the game for the first time.
[01:49.30]It's alright.
[01:49.95]It's okay.
[01:55.56]So Wednesday is the new day, not Monday.
[02:02.96]That's amazing news.
[02:05.85]Is that good news?
[02:11.65]Yeah, Squeaks DM me and he's like, hey man, my game keeps crashing every time I go into a battle.
[02:15.76]I was like, oh shit, we ain't doing this on Monday.
[02:29.04]If I was in the tourney, I'd have three times prepped with nine backups in case any got sick.
[02:38.97]No, it's all good.
[02:39.99]I give people homework for streams that we do.
[02:45.00]So, it's alright.
[02:46.00]It's okay.
[02:46.30]It's two days.
[02:48.87]It'll be fun.
[02:52.05]Sorry, actually, Wednesday is Switch Sundays.
[02:54.73]So, gonna have to reschedule that too.
[02:57.40]Oh, shit.
[02:57.80]Shit.
[03:03.60]If I was there, I would win.
[03:09.28]But yeah, so here's the plan.
[03:11.37]We actually got quite a lot of things going on next week.
[03:14.91]Uh... We got... Some sponsor stuff to do next week.
[03:21.07]There's some House Flipper stuff that... Wait, is it ads running?
[03:26.78]I didn't get a... I didn't get a countdown.
[03:28.62]What the fuck?
[03:31.54]alright we'll wait we'll wait I gotta get my coffee anyways I'll be right back usually I get a countdown where's my fucking countdown uh I'll be right back I want to grab my coffee and we'll continue talking about what I was gonna say in a minute
[05:02.45]Just sat back down.
[05:04.61]Hey, when's the next bush light night?
[05:07.78]Probably the weekend after this coming weekend.
[05:12.10]So not the weekend we're in right now, the weekend after next weekend.
[05:18.93]Well, I don't know, maybe.
[05:27.00]And this time I will drink some bush lights.
[05:30.43]I have to apologize.
[05:33.62]I did say that, hey guys, this is like a couple weeks ago, what, two or three weeks ago?
[05:39.72]Yeah, we're going to be drinking Bush Lights.
[05:41.29]It's going to be Bush Light Scare Sunday.
[05:44.59]And I drank a bunch of cocktails.
[05:46.95]Yeah, that's true.
[05:49.22]I really messed that up.
[05:52.64]We got to call it something else.
[05:53.96]It's Vodka Cranberry Night, right?
[05:55.69]I cannot mislead you like that.
[06:02.17]I got a minute of ads still, don't talk about anything cool.
[06:06.01]Don't worry, we'll just chill.
[06:08.22]We'll wait for everybody to get there.
[06:14.15]Are you gonna add more and more water to it every couple minutes like you do with the coffee?
[06:20.68]Look.
[06:24.69]Okay, let me explain.
[06:27.48]when you put when you have an iced coffee and you just kind of don't give a shit right if there's a bunch of ice in the coffee and I don't feel like getting up especially if it's a strong coffee if it's a really strong iced coffee like a cold brew or something I'll get halfway and I'll have a water next to the on the desk too and sometimes just like you know what I just don't really want to get up I'm in the middle of something I'm the middle of this it's not time for a break
[06:55.54]And I'll just pour a little bit of the water into the coffee and it's fine.
[07:00.13]I don't do this every... Okay, look, I don't do this every time I have a coffee.
[07:04.74]You know what?
[07:05.62]Why is it every time I... Let me ask you as a chat.
[07:08.98]Every time I talk about something that I did, I do that every time I do that thing.
[07:15.29]To some of you.
[07:17.53]It's like, oh yeah, I diluted my coffee, you know, once or twice.
[07:20.39]I do that every single time I've ever had a coffee in my whole life.
[07:24.80]What's up with that?
[07:34.10]How's the weather in Vegas?
[07:35.03]Actually, it's not that bad.
[07:37.49]And by not that bad, it's under 100.
[07:40.35]We've had so many over 105, 104, 108, 105, 105.
[07:46.34]When it's 98 degrees, when it's 95 degrees, it's like, ooh, oh, that's nice today.
[07:58.79]What was the Try Another game?
[08:01.46]I believe that was... Was it Mad Dog?
[08:06.69]Mad Dog, or no, was it maybe a Bounty Hunter?
[08:08.33]It was like a Bounty Hunter game or Mad Dog game?
[08:11.75]I forget.
[08:13.72]Alright, so let's go.
[08:14.28]Let's talk about what's going on.
[08:15.80]We're good with stalling now.
[08:17.44]So, Monster Ranch Tournament has been moved to Wednesday.
[08:21.87]Only a few of us had all of our monsters ready.
[08:24.25]And I didn't want people to start freaking out because people were like, wait, is it tomorrow?
[08:27.56]It's two days?
[08:28.74]But, no, no, don't worry.
[08:30.60]You got another few days to do it.
[08:32.60]So, we'll see what people end up doing.
[08:36.63]Got some sponsor stuff next week.
[08:38.41]And something else cool is going on next week.
[08:40.84]I am going to be hanging out with the House Flipper devs.
[08:47.27]We're going to do... I'm not sure what we're going to do.
[08:50.64]I think we're going to do like a Q&A.
[08:53.92]So I think for like 30... It's only going to be like 30-40 minutes.
[08:56.85]But I'm going to hang out with those devs and we're just going to like talk about the game and stuff.
[09:00.47]So it should be fun.
[09:02.35]So if you have any questions about House Flipper...
[09:07.09]I guess like I'll just pull them from the chat or something.
[09:09.79]I was thinking about making like a channel in the Discord, but the Discord's kind of, you know, in the sunset period where it's not really, it's only on stream days.
[09:19.13]But just like don't, you know, I'm not even going to say anything.
[09:25.26]If I say something, it's opposite day in this chat a lot of times.
[09:35.37]Yeah, can we ask weird questions?
[09:37.33]That is a... No!
[09:38.53]I mean, I don't... The House Flipper devs are cool, alright?
[09:42.08]But... I don't know, I think they're going to take some community questions too and they're going to talk about some stuff.
[09:48.41]They were like, do you have any questions for us?
[09:51.29]And I'm sitting there going... I actually kind of probably do have a couple of questions, so that'll be interesting at least.
[10:02.27]Alright, anyways, let's do it.
[10:04.19]I gotta train my last monster.
[10:05.95]I got one more monster to do.
[10:10.10]Uh, what happened to my... Um... I have an int monster.
[10:21.63]And I think the plan I'm doing with this guy is we are just going almost 100% intellect.
[10:33.59]Criken's monsters are cracked.
[10:37.75]Hey.
[10:39.37]Good.
[10:40.27]Good.
[10:40.53]That means we'll have a little competition then.
[10:42.46]That sounds good to me.
[10:43.26]Alright, so this is my last monster.
[10:47.14]This is the Kiss from a Rose monster.
[10:50.73]Let's take a look.
[10:54.77]He's got an insane amount of int to start with.
[10:58.26]This is Bee Chug.
[11:01.68]That's Dan, but that's, that's not what, that's Bush.
[11:04.51]No, I don't want to say that either.
[11:06.91]That is, uh, his name is, okay, his name is Brian, alright?
[11:11.86]It's Brian Chugg.
[11:13.08]That's his fucking full name.
[11:14.36]Alright, everybody relax.
[11:22.85]Uh, so here's what I want to do with this guy.
[11:25.97]I am going to try to get this guy to a thousand intellect.
[11:30.47]The health, who cares?
[11:31.61]He's going to be a one and done.
[11:34.18]One move, one hit KO monster.
[11:37.96]That's what I'm going to try to do.
[11:39.84]So just int and skill and just hope you laser beam somebody in one hit.
[11:47.15]The original Fenric whose save model you're using was in Kryken's chat.
[11:51.20]They were helping him.
[11:54.40]That's cool.
[12:00.27]Hey, I told everybody, take as much help as you want because this game is kind of all over the place with what you can and can't do.
[12:07.18]Speaking of which, I need to make sure I know what I'm doing.
[12:12.93]You need a speed monster?
[12:14.01]Do I not have- isn't, um, Yermit speed?
[12:19.75]Is Yermit not speed?
[12:23.70]I thought Yermit was speed.
[12:26.02]I don't know if this guy's gonna scale on speed.
[12:30.67]How come every time you do this, you make the worst creatures?
[12:34.03]This is... What are you... Hey!
[12:37.06]What are you talking about?
[12:37.92]I'm mad at you!
[12:41.05]Okay.
[12:43.61]This is a monster from Kiss from a Rose.
[12:49.16]Alright, let's do it.
[12:49.84]I think I got it.
[12:51.34]Okay, so remind me.
[12:53.53]It's...
[12:55.15]Hard Drill Nut Oil.
[12:57.89]Light Drill Mint.
[12:58.87]Hard Drill Nut Oil.
[13:00.26]Light Drill Mint.
[13:01.16]Right?
[13:05.00]Oh, by the way, I've got a really big announcement.
[13:07.86]This is probably only going to take like an hour or two.
[13:11.39]After this, I am finally... We're doing a sleep stream.
[13:16.09]I told you, I'm actually excited for it.
[13:19.68]We're playing A Dark Room after this.
[13:23.37]That is just a hangout.
[13:26.57]It's a menu game.
[13:28.67]It's very low key.
[13:29.63]It's very just chilled.
[13:32.01]So we're doing a sleep stream later.
[13:33.78]Hope you're ready.
[13:34.54]Menu game.
[13:37.20]Well, this is kind of a menu game too, isn't it?
[13:46.37]Okay, so let's go.
[13:48.05]I'm... Start with a drill.
[13:54.47]Oh wait, what does he like and dislike?
[13:55.71]That's important to know.
[14:01.46]Okay, he likes cup jelly, doesn't like fish.
[14:05.30]He's neutral.
[14:08.24]He's got spit.
[14:10.31]Okay, this is what I'm going to hope he does all the time.
[14:13.75]Remember, we're going all int.
[14:15.65]Yo, I have two major int characters though.
[14:17.92]Is that bad?
[14:20.22]Maybe he should just be across the board 200 in every step.
[14:23.58]Or is that boring?
[14:27.25]Is that too dull?
[14:28.91]What do you guys think?
[14:30.55]That might be too dull.
[14:42.01]I'm going to try to get him to at least 600 or 700 in.
[14:49.72]That's fine, that's okay, that's fine.
[14:52.30]That's okay, your first ever you cheated.
[14:57.68]Hey, I was watching your World of Warcraft let's play.
[15:04.27]Dude, imagine watching a WoW let's play and the let's play ends at like level 21.
[15:09.70]Oh, that would be, that's kind of sad.
[15:21.96]Can you even do a wow let's play?
[15:24.01]I feel like it's a wow forever play.
[15:35.94]Let's keep doing the light one.
[15:37.31]Oh no, I gotta do... I did it out of order, but it's fine.
[15:49.59]You don't need to play MMOs forever.
[15:51.39]Yeah, but I think calling something a let's play is... I guess really it just is kind of like, let's play this.
[15:57.57]Not necessarily let's finish this.
[16:09.47]Is he cheating again?
[16:15.09]Okay, I thought he was neutral natured.
[16:17.05]Why is he cheating two times in a row?
[16:21.45]Now you are going to get scolded.
[16:26.29]Hey, bro, I looked up a dark room gameplay.
[16:27.96]What is this?
[16:28.84]Well, you wrote, what the fuck is this?
[16:30.80]Which implies some type of, a little bit of cynicism on there, which I don't appreciate.
[16:34.98]So, hey, you don't have to watch it.
[16:41.39]And I don't appreciate that.
[16:49.28]Okay, I'm going to do a hard drill this time.
[16:59.62]Uh, what is it?
[17:01.20]Meditate?
[17:03.00]Alright, let's do this.
[17:11.11]How come you named it Bee Chug?
[17:13.13]I don't know, because I didn't know, I didn't, it could have gotten, like, grabbed by the online, um, will, ooh, that's not good.
[17:26.76]Okay, nut oil again.
[17:29.83]He actually might be fine to do a tournament.
[17:32.15]He's got pretty high base stats.
[17:40.08]Beanbag Sonic Chug.
[17:53.40]Is the game multiplayer?
[17:54.18]The game is not multiplayer, but it has... a feature where you can...
[17:59.49]download somebody else's monster and fight against it with whatever you want.
[18:05.14]So that's the... that is the the deal.
[18:09.51]I'm gonna be pulling people's monsters from their online database that they upload to, and then fighting them against each other, AI versus AI.
[18:28.15]I'm gonna have him sleep after this.
[18:36.34]Actually, no.
[18:37.44]One more month.
[18:38.82]And then he can rest.
[18:44.95]That's good.
[18:45.25]Already at 230 intellect.
[18:53.22]Hey, how long you gonna stream for?
[18:56.73]I don't know.
[18:57.25]I started 20 minutes ago.
[18:58.71]I don't know.
[19:02.86]I don't know.
[19:04.40]At least three to six hours?
[19:06.28]I have no idea.
[19:11.41]Alright, that's like going to a movie and the previews are over and the Star Wars rolling credits start.
[19:20.02]And you lean over to your friend and go, hey, you have any idea how long this movie is?
[19:26.21]How much left in the movie?
[19:30.32]Dude, the Star Wars credits are up.
[19:32.89]We're here for at least a few hours, man.
[19:38.94]Alright, when's the next battle?
[19:42.04]Alright, I'll do the next official tournament.
[19:47.09]Let's rest.
[19:47.85]I haven't rested at all.
[19:55.68]Do you think you're like Star Wars?
[20:00.56]I feel like that's like... I feel like that would be kind of funny to do that.
[20:07.47]Is have... Let's do it like streams for a week where you just hype up the streams so much.
[20:15.00]With like a crazy starting soon scream like...
[20:22.22]Have the Star Wars crawl with what we did last week.
[20:26.59]Oh, the Jedi Jerma and the Sith Squeaks battled on the Nintendo Switch and he narrowly escaped.
[20:34.08]Just do that and have every stream be like that.
[20:43.37]Oh, we're going.
[20:45.07]That's it.
[20:51.95]If it's such a huge deal that... No!
[20:57.04]He didn't even cheat.
[20:57.64]He just slept.
[21:05.11]That's true that Squeaks is a Sith.
[21:06.94]You don't know.
[21:07.34]We're both Siths.
[21:11.26]No.
[21:12.32]Actually, Squeaks is not a Sith.
[21:18.15]You okay over there?
[21:20.35]Otto's just like,
[21:26.94]I don't think I'm a Sith.
[21:28.00]I think I'm... a random senator in the Galactic Senate.
[21:44.72]No, I'm not C-3PO!
[21:47.31]Fuck, I forgot that we already went through this.
[22:02.88]You definitely see C-3PO.
[22:08.01]That's fine.
[22:09.09]I said this before and I'll say it again.
[22:10.37]C-3PO saves the fucking galaxy with his intellect.
[22:13.73]And his... support that he gives.
[22:19.04]And he's made out of solid gold.
[22:21.28]So that's fine.
[22:21.90]He's worth a lot.
[22:32.43]Don't cheat.
[22:38.05]Alright, I think it's time for an Errantry.
[22:44.76]I'm looking for an Int Errantry.
[22:58.28]Hey, this thing looks dumb.
[23:01.17]But that just shows how much you know about Monster Rancher.
[23:04.55]It's a Suezo.
[23:08.93]Alright, the official tournament is coming up next.
[23:12.43]Let's do an Errantry.
[23:18.32]Let's get him there.
[23:21.76]Alright, Int and Life.
[23:24.65]I really want a heavy technique.
[23:27.37]But... More skill technique.
[23:30.15]We'll do Int first.
[23:32.62]Now remember, Errantries take a ton of life off your monster and they do a lot of damage.
[23:45.54]Let's hope we don't fail any of this.
[23:50.74]Withering sucks.
[23:52.70]Withering is great, but I mean, I need Int.
[23:56.89]I'll get a heavy technique, but the power is not going to help me at all.
[24:00.67]See?
[24:01.23]Bingo.
[24:02.33]I'll get to, like, at least 270 from this.
[24:05.46]If he doesn't fail everything.
[24:12.64]Auto is definitely BB-8.
[24:13.95]Yeah, auto is not R2-D2.
[24:15.21]You have a Labubu yet?
[24:20.51]No, I don't.
[24:21.63]Actually, no.
[24:22.07]Actually, wait.
[24:23.03]Me and Holly have one.
[24:25.52]Holly has one.
[24:31.09]That could've been more.
[24:34.66]But, to be fair, hey, listen to this.
[24:39.30]Polly and I got our Labubu, like, months ago.
[24:42.83]Months ago.
[24:43.37]I'm talking at least three to four months ago.
[24:45.71]Months and months ago.
[24:51.17]This is before it was like, oh, Labubu Dubai chocolate chatter shit.
[24:54.84]Like, this is like six months ago.
[25:03.41]And we got one.
[25:07.23]What color is it?
[25:07.74]I think it's pink.
[25:24.66]Is that supposed to be cool?
[25:27.13]No, it's supposed to be a statement!
[25:29.85]Not every statement has to be, am I cool or not cool?
[25:33.54]It's just explaining something.
[25:36.36]It's just a statement.
[25:47.39]I always think that's funny.
[25:48.61]Oh shit, no, that's not good.
[25:55.98]You did good.
[26:00.82]Is he okay?
[26:02.10]He didn't look okay.
[26:06.89]I love the Scooby Doo sound they all make.
[26:17.71]Why are you wasting so much time on a monster that's gonna die in one hit?
[26:22.34]Exclamation point rules!
[26:25.45]Jerma right now is doing a training segment for his Monster Rancher tournament that he's putting on on Wednesday the 30th.
[26:34.03]The rules of this is everybody that's doing it has to pick their three favorite songs and has to use those monsters for their training.
[26:45.10]Uh-oh.
[26:58.88]What does making the room dark mean?
[27:00.55]It means you're playing a dark room later.
[27:04.01]He's still tired?
[27:05.07]Why is he... He actually got fucked up.
[27:08.92]He got fucked up during that.
[27:11.74]That's not good.
[27:15.93]I may have done some damage.
[27:20.04]He has to rest again.
[27:20.96]He's fucking... He's so screwed up.
[27:26.51]He's actually dying.
[27:27.75]I know, I'm working on it.
[27:38.98]Okay, he's okay.
[27:39.80]Alright, I'm gonna say... Let's do... What did I get?
[27:49.03]I got something.
[27:52.18]Do 60... Okay...
[27:55.09]Ooh, he got Lick.
[27:59.70]Doesn't really do a whole lot of damage, though.
[28:01.14]I did this Nut Oil, and then I want him to fight in the tournament.
[28:16.98]Yes.
[28:23.77]There we go.
[28:30.04]Alright, official tournament.
[28:33.09]Let's give him a nut oil.
[28:39.98]And see how he does.
[28:44.20]What's the plan if nobody shows up to the tournament?
[28:53.37]Uh, you think he's ready for D?
[28:56.96]I think he might be alright.
[29:00.57]I'll see if he can handle D. Um, if nobody shows up to the... Well, okay, that was specifically why I moved it to Wednesday.
[29:13.10]To make sure that people had enough time to be able to be ready.
[29:18.13]And these are all my friends.
[29:19.89]Guys, it's not like... Everybody that's going to be there is a friend of mine.
[29:26.72]If nobody showed up, I'd be like, what the fuck, dude?
[29:33.44]I'm not going to give advice because remember this is AI versus AI.
[29:36.39]We have to see how he is.
[29:39.58]Okay.
[29:40.70]He might not have been ready for D but maybe he is.
[29:47.53]Come on butt chug!
[29:52.38]Good dodge.
[30:02.01]Alright.
[30:02.71]There you go!
[30:03.29]There you go, Brian!
[30:07.84]Come on, Brian.
[30:11.04]Do it!
[30:17.61]Thankfully, uh... She's just doing this nonsense.
[30:24.71]Come on!
[30:26.77]Do something!
[30:29.41]Do anything!
[30:32.32]You can't act like this in the tournament.
[30:42.80]He's so confused.
[30:43.74]He's going to win, but... He could have won so many times.
[30:58.12]Oh, by the way, we're going to be using this exact system here.
[31:01.86]So we'll be doing, this is how it's going to be.
[31:03.43]There's going to be, there's currently six of us.
[31:06.03]So we'll have a round robin like this.
[31:10.01]And what I've decided, what we kind of, we talked about last time is we're going to do three of these.
[31:16.36]So you have to pick one monster that is in the tournament in that bracket and you cannot change them.
[31:22.51]So let's say if I say, you know what, of the three, who do I want to put in there first?
[31:27.67]It's gonna be Brian Chug.
[31:29.69]Brian Chug is just in it, and you cannot, he's staying in.
[31:33.42]Then we do it again for the next one, and then we do it again for the next one.
[31:46.49]Alright, make it two in a row.
[31:53.34]Alright, he's got a very high base int, so this should be good.
[31:58.30]Come on, Brian!
[32:08.29]You have a big intelligent eye.
[32:12.55]Why would you not use it?
[32:14.96]Don't use your weak tail.
[32:20.24]Spit!
[32:22.91]Spit!
[32:28.72]spit is only 10 guts you could just spam it and win every fucking round stop doing lick and just do spit he's kind of stupid he's stupid
[33:01.58]He sucks!
[33:12.25]Don't be mean!
[33:13.11]He didn't even try!
[33:20.62]Come on, Brian!
[33:27.83]Okay, he has to win this to stay in the tournament.
[33:30.76]Because remember, you get stats.
[33:31.82]You get pretty good stats if you win a tournament.
[33:35.66]My stats are so much better.
[33:36.78]Just hit him three times with a spit and you'll win.
[33:44.83]Okay, he keeps going in close.
[33:46.55]I don't know why he's doing that.
[33:47.62]I don't know why he's not standing in the middle.
[33:50.84]He keeps doing the tail swipe.
[33:53.70]And he's got two perfectly good int moves.
[33:55.24]And he has 300 int almost.
[33:57.15]And he keeps doing tail assault.
[33:59.49]Stop doing tail assault!
[34:04.52]Oh my god, he's just dumb!
[34:08.47]That's the worst move he has!
[34:09.67]He's gonna beat him with the tail swipe, isn't he?
[34:28.38]Finally!
[34:31.00]Look at how much more damage that does.
[34:39.77]That was a huge dodge.
[34:41.15]I'm actually happy with him.
[34:54.05]Don't ban me if you think I'm more powerful than you.
[34:59.12]Alright, you're not...
[35:01.02]Wait, what is... Don't ban... Do not ban me if you think I'm more power... Alright, I see what you're doing.
[35:16.14]Okay, this is anybody's game now.
[35:25.51]Uh, this is going to be hard because...
[35:28.49]This character is very balanced, but all we need is a few licks.
[35:32.64]And that's it.
[35:37.82]I feel like his speed is not high enough to dodge this many times.
[35:45.45]Come on, Brian!
[35:47.85]Spit!
[35:52.62]Spit!
[36:00.57]okay alright he's gonna lose do this one good dodge if he gets two spits off right now I don't know what he's doing spit is 10 mana he could do it there he finally do it again
[36:31.25]Oh my God.
[36:33.93]And he got KO'd too.
[36:39.96]Okay.
[36:42.31]He's not going to win this, but it's alright.
[36:45.51]So do I need to send him on a heavy air entry?
[36:53.22]We need something long.
[36:54.00]Somebody said long range.
[36:54.78]I need something way longer.
[36:58.63]Heavy tech?
[37:10.70]How is this thing even in the tournament?
[37:13.37]Look at this thing.
[37:24.45]You're not going to let this plant kill you.
[37:31.58]Yeah, he needs something back here.
[37:33.08]Something all the way in the back.
[37:39.59]You're gonna kill him if you do Errantry too much?
[37:42.96]Didn't Vinny do ten Errantries in a row when he was a baby?
[37:47.16]That's so funny.
[37:53.07]That's so funny.
[37:54.43]Is that monster alive?
[37:55.86]He beat the shit out of that poor monster.
[38:00.12]Is it still alive?
[38:08.25]Oh my god, he beat him!
[38:09.87]I was not expecting that.
[38:15.98]He was a cruel Monster Rancher.
[38:21.62]Yeah, I heard that Vinny's monster was exhausted every single day.
[38:28.05]Like, actually, the barn doors open and it's like... I was like, oh no, that's not good.
[38:42.08]Alright, I have a chance here if he can just get it done.
[38:52.60]Alright, come on.
[38:53.82]Look at how low his int is.
[38:55.06]You can blow him away with your spit.
[38:59.99]Do it.
[39:01.47]No.
[39:03.09]Why would you do that to his... This is like a huge defense monster.
[39:10.36]When the tournament actually happens, I'm going to be sitting back there screaming.
[39:16.03]Do it!
[39:17.25]Spit it out!
[39:19.12]Spit it out!
[39:29.35]I'm going to do the scream like mom and dad are sleeping in the other room.
[39:37.96]No dude!
[39:39.14]What?
[39:42.80]Yeah!
[39:44.74]Do that two more times and you win!
[39:46.13]Do it!
[39:49.05]Ugh!
[39:58.04]Okay.
[39:59.34]So we know we need way more int moves.
[40:04.81]He'll get something from this though.
[40:05.71]He got like second place?
[40:12.67]650 bucks.
[40:22.66]Okay.
[40:25.83]That's fine.
[40:28.57]That's fine.
[40:31.89]Yes, sure.
[40:39.83]Okay, let's give him tablets.
[40:41.27]Always give tablets.
[40:47.87]I think people are going to be feeding potatoes and yogurts to their monsters even if they don't like it.
[40:54.64]They're not even going to know.
[41:02.88]He sucks, bro.
[41:03.70]No, he actually doesn't.
[41:04.48]He's got an insane int.
[41:15.97]Criken was feeding him hard drugs?
[41:22.13]Should I give this guy drugs?
[41:24.33]Like the drugs?
[41:26.09]The actual drugs?
[41:36.82]Okay, this is... Temporarily stimulate a monster's abilities.
[41:42.47]This will stimulate a monster and help it to make it more disciplined.
[41:46.51]Stimulate a monster's speed and power.
[41:49.51]Power and defense will increase.
[41:52.56]Life and skill will increase, however speed will decrease.
[41:57.39]Should I try, should I see what this does?
[41:59.25]I've never even used one of these before.
[42:07.94]It's, I think it's the only chance he has.
[42:09.21]There's no INT one though.
[42:11.63]Skill is a big deal.
[42:15.74]Okay, I'm gonna try it.
[42:21.78]Wait, what?
[42:23.04]What happened?
[42:23.68]Does he have higher stats?
[42:40.16]How much did he lose?
[42:41.32]How much did he gain?
[42:42.52]I don't even know how much he gained.
[42:45.42]He had, what did he have before?
[42:46.62]He has 163.
[42:47.58]Oh, you didn't use it.
[42:49.93]Okay.
[42:56.37]Okay, life and skill will increase, speed will decrease.
[42:59.06]Alright, take it.
[43:06.31]Oh.
[43:16.87]I don't want to do that.
[43:21.10]It went up by 10.
[43:23.90]This went down by 10, though.
[43:25.68]I think that's bad.
[43:29.49]I mean, I could just give him... I don't think it's worth it.
[43:37.90]He's too... I don't think he can handle it.
[43:58.83]good okay there we go that's what I want to see I want this number over four or five hundred don't feed it more drugs what else you got in here sour jelly magic banana maybe let's just give him a banana
[44:32.73]Give him a stimulant and put him on an errantry?
[44:35.93]Would that do anything for him?
[44:41.42]I don't know.
[44:56.22]Just do them all?
[44:59.46]I don't want him to die.
[45:12.94]Okay, back to it.
[45:13.78]How old is he right now?
[45:14.64]Four months?
[45:18.43]Four months.
[45:18.91]Okay.
[45:23.30]Let's keep... I'm just going to go between study and meditate.
[45:26.04]We've got to get him over 500.
[45:26.94]And then we've got to get him a crazy damage like energy beam move.
[45:39.57]He's not getting a whole lot from just the standard training.
[45:43.66]Maybe I should just skip standard training and just do heavy training all the time.
[45:51.59]Let's get him on an Errantry.
[45:53.00]We need to.
[45:54.14]He's got to get something.
[45:56.18]We're almost at six months.
[46:12.10]Okay, the question is... A heavy tech is what we're looking for, right?
[46:19.61]There's some chance to acquire a new technique.
[46:21.49]I need a heavy tech.
[46:24.30]We just have to hope it's not a power move.
[46:26.86]It has to be an int move.
[46:33.77]I think this is the best way to go about doing it.
[46:40.84]Right?
[46:41.48]I hope so.
[46:42.45]Otherwise, this is a waste of time.
[46:44.17]That's what I'm looking for, right?
[46:45.31]You want a big, heavy move.
[46:49.26]Do the spy tech?
[46:54.24]What do you mean, spy?
[47:01.70]Somebody said that's wrong.
[47:05.42]Um...
[47:07.42]Wouldn't it would have would it wouldn't any monster ranch or two um connoisseurs in here?
[47:15.93]Does this have a possible to be an int move?
[47:22.14]It's supposed to be you.
[47:25.11]Yeah, I just like to drink it.
[47:26.09]I don't know very much about it.
[47:29.49]No, no, no, yes, okay.
[47:35.03]Power and heavy would be a physical attack, so I should just do the INT one and hope that I get... a, um, another INT move?
[47:42.66]Because that, you only get, you get withering moves there.
[47:54.45]The tech is withering.
[47:56.89]Withering rooms?
[47:57.99]Dude!
[47:59.73]Guys!
[48:01.16]I didn't even know about this.
[48:03.18]Red alert.
[48:05.22]withering rooms the dev has a new game coming out it's called withering realms you I couldn't hit the wishlist button fast enough it looks sick it looks awesome I think it's coming out around the fall we are we are doing a launch party for that game I'm gonna play the game day one launch party
[48:33.10]Withering Realms.
[48:34.72]Go check it out.
[48:35.30]It's on Steam right now.
[48:38.06]Well, it's not out, but it'll be whenever it comes out at the end of the year.
[48:42.09]That's a day one launch party event.
[48:44.99]I'm just going to do Int again, whatever.
[48:49.12]It is what it is.
[48:53.86]I think this guy's a late bloomer.
[48:55.09]That's why his stats suck.
[48:58.42]So maybe I should just do a ton of stuff to lower the lifespan?
[49:03.73]I think if that's the case then we have to lower the lifespan.
[49:07.50]So when I get to about a year and a half then I get a ton of stat points.
[49:11.80]I think we do have to do a bunch of drugs.
[49:23.65]You might kill him though.
[49:32.90]He's four months old.
[49:35.22]All these monsters live to be like two.
[49:39.63]So he's like, he's almost 40.
[49:40.87]Alright, come on, don't fail this.
[49:55.37]I need all these stats.
[50:00.52]No.
[50:08.17]You used to be almost 40.
[50:10.55]I am almost 40 still.
[50:12.19]Don't spread this misinformation.
[50:22.81]No, he's gonna fail.
[50:24.21]I think that's it.
[50:27.72]No, I think he got it.
[50:30.04]Yeah!
[50:32.75]Oh shit!
[50:34.49]Is he alive?
[50:35.71]Alright, he's alive, right?
[50:40.48]Uh-oh.
[50:46.87]God damn it.
[50:51.16]We need to lower his... This sounds so awful.
[50:54.40]But we need to lower his lifespan.
[51:00.48]So, because if he is a late bloomer, which he probably is, then we need to make his total life lower.
[51:10.12]Because I can only train him up to two years.
[51:24.21]Okay.
[51:24.33]I'm not doing an Errantry for a little while.
[51:30.38]I keep thinking about Vinny going on ten Errantries in a row.
[51:41.07]That's been making me laugh at random times throughout the day for the last week.
[51:57.58]Let's get him into another training regiment.
[52:06.59]I need more oil.
[52:09.58]There it is.
[52:26.28]Not oil and mint leaves?
[52:27.24]Yeah, I know the terrain.
[52:28.26]I'm just kind of trying to make his life get lower.
[52:39.07]Okay, he's at 300 in.
[52:40.25]That's good.
[52:50.84]Hey, does Unk know better games are out?
[52:54.43]Time the person out for at least 45 minutes.
[52:59.88]At least 45 minutes in Monster Rancher 2 years.
[53:04.23]So that's like 25 seconds.
[53:15.06]All the Errantry locations have a chance to teach both physical and int moves.
[53:20.25]The difference between them is whether they're heavy, withering, sharp, or hit.
[53:23.71]Alright, so we're going for a heavy move next.
[53:25.44]We have to.
[53:43.44]You're gonna be playing Elden Ring?
[53:44.73]I beat it!
[53:46.67]I beat it like nine times!
[53:49.37]It's one of my favorite games ever!
[53:51.69]I already beat it!
[53:54.16]You understand?
[53:55.48]Alright, we're going Rest.
[54:04.03]Errantry.
[54:09.20]No, we're not.
[54:15.39]He's very well.
[54:22.05]Okay.
[54:31.64]You haven't beaten this game?
[54:34.19]Um... I've gotten to S rank and then I've done I think two of the four end game tournaments.
[54:47.16]This is kind of a long game.
[54:53.31]If you play this game without any of the save file shenanigans that we're doing, it takes a long time.
[54:59.22]It's a little more of a longer... Because you have to... Because remember, you don't have this much money.
[55:06.32]You need to make money.
[55:08.58]Is this game harder than Elden Ring?
[55:11.36]Um... I don't know, man.
[55:13.49]That's like two completely different things.
[55:15.99]That's like saying, is knitting a sweater harder than Elden Ring?
[55:19.72]Probably for a lot of people, I would say yeah.
[55:23.06]But if you're a grandma, grandma would say, Elden Ring, no, knitting a sweater is incredibly simple.
[55:29.09]But you can't, wait, you mean to tell me you can't knit a sweater?
[55:33.27]I want to see the achievements for how many people got to the second part of the sweater.
[55:37.99]Because that's unbelievable to me, that you just can't get good and you're not good enough to knit the sweater.
[55:44.00]It's just perspective.
[55:44.80]It depends on what you do, who you are.
[55:46.08]I don't know.
[55:49.67]Okay.
[55:50.81]We are doing Errantry.
[55:53.07]Because I'm stupid.
[55:59.50]Power.
[56:00.31]Heavy tech.
[56:02.29]Heavy tech.
[56:03.75]We need a heavy int move.
[56:05.34]We don't care about the stats, we just care about the tech.
[56:08.74]Come on, Brian!
[56:23.25]Let me solo knitting a sweater.
[56:31.65]Ryan's got it.
[56:32.96]And we're gonna get laser beam eye.
[56:36.48]Come on.
[56:38.43]Nooo!
[56:45.22]Your monster doesn't have any heavy int pecs.
[56:48.28]Are you kidding me?
[56:52.41]What?
[56:54.17]He doesn't have any heavy int moves?
[56:58.12]So what should I do?
[56:59.46]Hit tech?
[57:00.78]Or sharp?
[57:03.04]Sharp doesn't make any sense, does it?
[57:11.30]Sharp, okay.
[57:12.16]I'll try sharp next time.
[57:13.18]Well, fuck!
[57:13.64]This is- I threw a whole month in the trash!
[57:16.40]Oh no.
[57:22.41]But OK, it's fine.
[57:23.70]Honestly, him getting power is not even that bad.
[57:27.46]Because he see oh fuck that's going to be a power move.
[57:35.66]If what you're saying is accurate.
[57:43.45]What if that person is wrong?
[57:46.33]What if it isn't?
[57:47.09]That'd be amazing.
[57:50.44]gonna play the new Resident Evil when it comes out um I would say probably played all the other ones on stream at least since um the new era of Resident Evil games I played seven eight and wasn't there another one that came out nine I don't know which one did no it was seven and eight no four I'm thinking of the four remake
[58:17.19]And I did 2 and 3 remake as well.
[58:18.65]Yeah, since the new era of these games, I've definitely played them on stream, so probably.
[58:28.85]But yeah, getting power is not awful because he seems to do the power move all the time.
[58:33.89]And it's a close-up move, so whatever.
[58:35.26]It's fine.
[58:38.80]You need to play Terraria?
[58:39.78]Sturve ruined your experience.
[58:42.61]I had fun.
[58:46.35]Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.
[58:49.47]You want sharp.
[58:51.60]Alright, we'll go sharp next.
[58:57.63]Gonna get sucked up.
[59:01.17]Uh-oh.
[59:03.52]Nooo!
[59:10.02]Oh shit, he failed!
[59:11.43]What?!
[59:11.67]!
[59:14.63]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[59:19.46]He got sucked into the sand.
[59:20.74]Is he okay?
[59:23.96]How long is this going to take?
[59:28.53]He's in the hospital.
[59:29.69]Hopefully he comes back.
[59:34.21]Oh no, he's in the hospital still.
[59:37.90]We're losing a lot of time here.
[59:39.34]This guy's not going to go.
[59:40.58]Wait, he's fine.
[59:41.16]We're fine.
[59:44.60]Hold on.
[59:45.44]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[59:46.27]Here, you can have all your favorites.
[59:47.77]Here, you can have a cake.
[59:49.51]Have a cake.
[59:49.87]You can have a cake.
[59:53.34]Have a cake.
[59:54.54]And then you can sleep.
[59:58.74]Yep.
[59:59.23]Okay.
[59:59.65]Now get some sleep.
[60:00.81]Get some rest.
[60:03.03]It's okay.
[60:15.70]He chugged his last bee.
[60:18.87]He's okay.
[60:21.19]Let's give you some nut oil.
[60:24.72]He's fine.
[60:30.68]Okay.
[60:33.73]I need to do sharp... We're not doing an errantry right away.
[60:36.43]We're going to let him rest.
[60:40.84]He's not taking any more drugs.
[60:41.96]That's what happened.
[60:43.00]I told you I didn't want to do it.
[60:53.59]how many can I buy alright we'll do meditate and then he can I'm gonna have him rest again after that and then I'm gonna take a break
[61:19.12]Well, if I was looking for a way to drop his lifespan... He's... Okay, that's way more than he had before.
[61:28.11]That was a crazy increase.
[61:33.91]I'm afraid to send him on another air entry though, because he might die.
[61:42.12]But I will be right back.
[61:44.83]See you guys in three to four minutes.
[61:48.16]I'm going to get a drink and I'm going to stand up for a little bit.
[61:51.43]And we'll continue.
[61:52.31]How old is he now?
[61:53.07]Okay, we're at just about one year.
[61:56.15]So we got to get him to two years.
[62:03.14]I will be right back.
[62:04.10]See you guys in a few minutes.
[62:14.47]I don't know what to do.
[62:41.52]I'm not sure what to do.
[62:42.02]I don't know what to do.
[62:49.67]Oh, I see.
[63:10.33]I don't know what to do.
[63:36.00]I don't know what to do.
[63:36.50]I don't know what to do.
[63:37.00]I don't know what to do.
[63:38.44]This is the first time I've played this game in a long time, so I'm excited to see how it will turn out.
[64:08.63]Thank you.
[64:41.92]I don't know what I'm talking about.
[65:10.85]I have returned.
[65:45.44]Alright, he's still fine.
[65:48.75]I wonder how much life he has left.
[65:57.88]Uh, you should do rock band on stream with the four horsemen.
[66:01.79]You sing, poke drums, Ster guitar, and Vinny is bass.
[66:11.76]Uh...
[66:14.20]Oh, that'd be kind of fun.
[66:18.02]Yeah, why am I the singer?
[66:27.76]Guys, just give me the tambourine, okay?
[66:34.39]I'll take the tambourine and I'll be the one that does all the band interviews, okay?
[66:40.08]I'll be like the guy that does the interviews and I'll do the tambourine.
[66:57.11]You would be the problematic member.
[67:00.15]Why am I the problem?
[67:01.23]What do you mean?
[67:01.60]Why am I the problematic member?
[67:12.14]you have the ego why would I I just I want to play the tambourine okay we got a train we got to go you you would be the yoko ono
[67:37.95]No, I wouldn't.
[67:38.89]No, I wouldn't.
[67:40.41]I... I... Let me be the guy... Let me be, like, the manager of the band.
[67:43.55]You know, the guy that's... Okay, you know, um... You know, Death Clock?
[67:48.42]The guy that talks like this, and you guys have spent so much money this past year, and unfortunately, we cannot be invited back to Hungary this year.
[67:58.93]That's who I would be.
[68:06.03]you'd be the evil manager the enabler do you like metalocalypse I love that's a great show and movies that's a wonderful show I it's like it's one of the great one of the great adult swim shows back in the day okay we're gonna try we're gonna try we're gonna try
[68:34.97]We're going meditate.
[68:40.94]It's actually hard to do that.
[68:46.33]Really hard.
[69:00.90]Death clock, death clock.
[69:02.67]I feel like I did that recently.
[69:03.79]Didn't we talk about this like a few months ago?
[69:15.44]I got a train.
[69:21.40]Hoke is Meatwad, Ster is Master Shake, Vinny is Frylock, and you're Carl.
[69:26.33]I don't think that's accurate either.
[69:43.51]poke is definitely master shake that's what you think I don't know I'm thinking okay I don't know that's a hard one because like on a given day Ster could be any one of those characters any of them on a given day depends on what day it is
[70:14.44]I feel like I gravitate towards Shake.
[70:26.29]I feel like that's who I feel like.
[70:30.94]Did I just say I like feel like that's like who I feel like?
[70:34.34]What the hell did I just do?
[70:44.65]shake I don't know what about those moon people oh Carl we're here to kill you whatever he says I feel sometimes I kind of feel that like that those two the moon nights yeah
[71:06.08]What about the other aliens?
[71:07.93]I sometimes feel like that guy.
[71:29.18]You're the diaper-wearing demon.
[71:32.64]the wrapping diaper wait mc are you talking about mc yeah mcp pants mcp pants I want candy bubblegum and taffy that's a classic episode man
[72:07.42]Alright, is he well enough to do another Errantry?
[72:11.49]How about we rest him two times in a row?
[72:15.46]Whoa, he's in a new place!
[72:18.68]We're in a new location.
[72:19.99]He's leveled up.
[72:22.07]He's gonna get like 20 from this.
[72:25.60]Aww man.
[72:29.19]You need to tell the pee-pants story for the new viewers.
[72:32.50]Wait, I've told the pee-pants story.
[72:34.04]I told it, like, three or four months ago.
[72:37.64]I don't know if there's very many new viewers in the last month or two.
[73:02.27]We want to hear it again, again, again.
[73:04.67]It really is like reading a kid's book sometimes to you guys, isn't it?
[73:11.88]Like, which one do you want to read today?
[73:13.56]I want to read that one.
[73:15.28]Oh, you wanted to give a mouse a cookie again?
[73:17.34]Yes.
[73:19.16]Okay.
[73:21.18]So, one time, me and Burgah Boy were playing Smite.
[73:27.29]That's the one.
[73:27.89]I like that one.
[73:29.29]Yes.
[73:34.36]That's a good book.
[73:35.40]It is a good book, you're right.
[73:37.17]Alright, I'm resting.
[73:38.03]And we are going on another Errantry.
[73:42.69]We're going to Sharp.
[73:43.52]And I know I'm draining his life force.
[73:46.08]But he's a late bloomer.
[73:47.12]And we need another ability.
[73:50.45]And I can't, I've only got like another eight or nine months.
[73:54.11]He's very well.
[73:55.07]He's very, very, very well.
[73:58.00]Okay, come on.
[74:01.18]Sharp tech.
[74:02.92]Sharp tech.
[74:05.97]There's some chance to get a new technique.
[74:09.07]Go!
[74:20.18]Uh, so you make lobbies in Smite.
[74:22.84]That's- this is old Smite.
[74:23.95]This is- this is Smite 1.2.
[74:26.17]Yeah!
[74:26.69]Uh, we got one, okay.
[74:31.39]Settle down, it's- what am I doing?
[74:35.10]And I feel like I've told this story so many times.
[74:38.58]I really am the mom with the book.
[74:41.16]If you give a mouse a cookie, he's going to ask for some milk.
[74:45.45]If you give a mouse some milk, he's going to ask for to play.
[74:51.96]If you give a mouse, if you let a mouse play, I mean, you know, it's like the 500th time I've read you.
[75:00.43]If you give a mouse a cookie,
[75:14.65]What else you got?
[75:15.49]Be honest.
[75:16.05]What do you mean?
[75:19.30]You can't remember the story.
[75:20.64]I know the story and you're not gonna gaslight me into... Okay.
[75:24.52]So there was a lobby system in SMITE and you have to make a password.
[75:29.23]So, okay, what's the password?
[75:32.05]Burgah Boy told me the password was pee pants.
[75:34.39]So I was like, okay, fine.
[75:35.09]So I type it in.
[75:35.87]You know, P-E-E-P-A-N-T-S.
[75:39.48]Pee pants.
[75:40.91]And it didn't work.
[75:42.21]And he was like, why do it?
[75:43.59]It should work.
[75:44.91]And I go, it doesn't work.
[75:45.73]That password doesn't work.
[75:46.49]And I tried it five or six times.
[75:48.19]He got angry with me.
[75:49.88]I got angry with him too.
[75:51.54]Because he was telling me that I was not... He couldn't believe that I couldn't get it right.
[75:55.76]And I couldn't believe that I was still typing the password in wrong somehow.
[76:00.83]So I asked him, I said, alright, dude.
[76:04.31]What is the password?
[76:04.95]You write it.
[76:05.99]And he sat down and he wrote it.
[76:08.67]He wrote it down and it...
[76:11.79]He was spelling it P-E-E-P-A-N-C-E.
[76:17.52]P-Pants.
[76:20.00]We agreed the password was P-Pants and that's how he was spelling it.
[76:23.45]And he started laughing hysterically.
[76:26.36]Cause by the way, forgot to tell you, um, he was very high.
[76:31.47]This is, this was like a, this is like a high day.
[76:35.23]And, uh,
[76:37.69]This is a long time ago.
[76:38.85]This is like 15 years ago or like 12 years ago.
[76:42.32]When did Smite 1 even come out?
[76:43.54]It was like 10 years ago.
[76:55.59]It's been 11 years.
[76:56.67]That is crazy to think about that.
[77:05.34]Did it really come out 11 years ago?
[77:10.21]Alright, please have it be int.
[77:14.62]Oh, we are so, so ready.
[77:20.95]Does this thing suck?
[77:27.66]This thing kind of stinks.
[77:36.53]D in everything but sharpness?
[77:39.94]Move spit to the back.
[77:41.75]Uh, you can't.
[77:44.13]He's gonna have so much trouble with this row.
[77:46.43]I just hope he just spams this.
[78:07.66]He's gonna use bite.
[78:08.76]Yeah.
[78:11.72]Let's get him in a tournament to see how he does.
[78:16.93]This one, okay, this one coming up here is only four.
[78:19.09]We'll do this one next week.
[78:32.87]You need 650 int.
[78:35.04]Plus speed combined?!
[78:36.40]!
[78:38.64]Dude, I ain't getting that much speed before year two.
[78:46.24]I'll be lucky to get this over 600 or 700, which is what I'm going to try to do.
[78:59.19]Oh, combined.
[79:00.37]Oh, I thought you meant... Okay, alright, I'm stupid.
[79:05.68]For some reason, I thought that meant do both of them.
[79:09.72]Alright, this is where we just spam int.
[79:11.98]Int, int, int.
[79:13.61]We're going to train int every single week.
[79:15.21]It's going to get to 700.
[79:19.24]Hey, it's first birthday.
[79:21.16]We got one more year.
[79:27.47]Happy birthday, happy birthday.
[79:39.61]length of tournament it used to be Monday but it's now Wednesday wanted to give everybody a little bit more time to make monsters uh some people were concerned that they might not have enough time and some people were having technical problems with the game uh and crashing and stuff so they uh just want to make sure people have enough a window and some padding to not freak out and have to be pressured to hurry up tomorrow
[80:08.14]What do you mean, some people?
[80:10.46]What do you mean?
[80:10.94]What?
[80:13.45]What?
[80:23.76]What do you mean, some people?
[80:25.16]Okay.
[80:26.92]Criken and I, I think, are the only people that have monsters trained.
[80:32.34]I think Vinny has one.
[80:34.39]So there's only three of us that even have monsters right now.
[80:42.23]It's funny, Criken actually, did I tell this?
[80:44.15]Criken DM'd me.
[80:45.90]He said, hey, is it bad if my monster dies at one year, nine months?
[80:52.77]And then 10 minutes later, 15 minutes later, he said, oh, never mind, we're good, he made it.
[81:09.90]Criken is juiced?
[81:10.98]Alright, well, I have to take this seriously.
[81:15.37]I gotta get this guy up.
[81:16.43]If Criken's got some juiced monsters, then this guy's gotta be ready.
[81:21.20]I'm juicing.
[81:38.54]Okay, he's good, right?
[81:39.66]Let's go.
[81:46.29]Ster said you're the only one actually trying.
[81:52.60]Yeah, I don't think even Ster has installed the game yet.
[81:57.00]I don't know what he's talking about.
[81:59.36]Well, actually I do.
[82:00.14]That means he isn't taking it seriously.
[82:08.11]Although Ster did ask, Ster said, hey, when is homework due?
[82:12.89]He did ask that yesterday.
[82:14.03]He did say that.
[82:31.97]He's rage baiting you.
[82:35.88]Yeah, I know.
[82:37.00]We're all just messing around.
[82:38.68]It's fine.
[82:45.77]New classroom.
[82:49.78]We've got to get to 600 int.
[82:51.16]And then we need to send him to a sharp errantry.
[83:06.78]I think I just have to completely focus on only that right now.
[83:25.79]Do you have any good moves?
[83:27.45]I don't... I mean, he has a couple of decent ones.
[83:29.59]Spit is good, he just has to use it.
[83:32.04]But we're going to run into the same problem that the first guy has.
[83:34.36]He's going to have too many moves.
[83:36.47]Maybe I shouldn't do Errantries.
[83:37.91]Maybe I should just hope he just does the three INT moves he has.
[83:53.58]BeeChug's got the blue eyeliner on.
[83:55.69]Does he?
[83:58.97]Yeah, I guess he does.
[84:11.29]We'll get to 600 int, 650 int.
[84:12.55]I definitely have enough time to get there.
[84:18.36]Especially if we just train him.
[84:20.40]Don't do any tournaments.
[84:34.71]We need at least one more slot on slot 1.
[84:39.60]Let's see.
[84:50.90]How come he hasn't done any greats yet?
[84:53.78]He hasn't had any great successes.
[85:02.86]You need to socialize him?
[85:03.78]He's going to crumble in front of a crowd.
[85:11.98]I think he's fine.
[85:22.07]We don't care about any of this.
[85:23.57]All we care about is going for training only until he's at 650 int.
[85:29.96]I guess I could do fast forward here, couldn't I?
[85:42.64]Can I just turn the volume down?
[85:43.68]Because it's going to be like...
[85:57.98]No, dude, just keep it.
[86:02.02]It'll be funny.
[86:03.47]Alright, I'll do fast forward for a little bit.
[86:08.17]Okay, here we go.
[86:09.00]Let's speed run this.
[86:11.26]Training.
[86:13.02]Item.
[86:16.95]We want mint leaf.
[86:21.50]Hard drill.
[86:28.22]Let's go.
[86:33.56]Good.
[86:34.38]Perfect.
[86:42.45]Nut oil.
[86:44.38]Light drill.
[86:55.27]Ooh, he got it.
[86:55.93]Nice.
[86:59.81]Mint leaf.
[87:00.75]Hard drill.
[87:16.58]Do another grate.
[87:20.18]That's fine.
[87:20.72]Just gotta get this to 650.
[87:26.54]Send him to Pare Pare Errantry.
[87:28.88]Get him that int slot on, um, on slot one.
[87:33.60]You think so?
[87:35.02]What if he dies?
[87:38.21]I'm resting him then doing it.
[87:39.29]Fine.
[87:53.24]What does the B stand for?
[87:54.04]Brian.
[87:59.54]I like this off for these.
[88:01.33]These are fun.
[88:05.71]Okay.
[88:06.33]It said go to Pare Pare.
[88:09.78]We're looking for slot one int move.
[88:11.46]It's actually really important.
[88:12.44]That's true.
[88:13.64]Let's do it.
[88:26.97]What you're doing is no ramification.
[88:28.19]This game's hot garbage.
[88:29.21]Admit it and move on.
[88:33.46]Well, you can play the games you like, and I can play the games that I like.
[88:36.34]That's the beauty of liking things.
[88:47.00]Hey, Grandma doesn't have to like this game either.
[88:49.78]Just like I don't care about knitting a sweater, Grandma.
[89:10.01]I think you would actually enjoy that.
[89:19.27]I don't think I would.
[89:20.12]I think I would fucking hate that.
[89:41.38]Good.
[89:42.15]Almost over 500.
[89:57.06]Crochet is easier.
[89:58.12]I didn't... Okay, I just realized now he has a green tongue.
[90:08.66]That's cool.
[90:24.62]Alright.
[90:25.88]No one's kill- this is bad, because if he gets crushed here it's gonna be terrible.
[90:30.10]He did it!
[90:30.41]Okay, good.
[90:39.84]Please, censor the ass licking.
[90:49.07]What the fuck, man?
[90:53.83]Alright, what is it?
[90:59.54]Somebody said that the tech will be in the first slot now?
[91:03.35]He's gonna have so many moves, he's not gonna know what the hell to do with himself.
[91:07.20]He's not happy.
[91:08.76]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[91:10.22]We're only doing one more error entry in the rest of his life.
[91:14.23]Okay?
[91:30.84]We're only doing one more Errantry.
[91:32.32]We're doing sharp Errantry when he gets to 650.
[91:34.22]Why are you feeding him seed oils?
[91:45.50]Because it brings down fatigue.
[92:00.06]Ooh, he got Kiss.
[92:04.41]Okay.
[92:06.83]He's Kiss, Spit, Lick, and Telepathy.
[92:17.38]He's a weirdo.
[92:19.08]What's his deal?
[92:22.93]Where is I, Laserbeam?
[92:24.87]He's Int.
[92:30.03]How is spitting int?
[92:34.48]Well, just licking.
[92:35.46]That's not int?
[92:38.00]When I think of intelligence moves, I think of... You know, laser beams coming out of your eyes.
[92:43.43]I think of magical lightning and fire and... A spit.
[92:50.26]Okay.
[92:51.64]Um... Let's keep it going.
[92:57.93]Gotta get to 650.
[92:58.45]Oh, I can put this back on.
[93:07.73]Good.
[93:23.33]More int.
[93:24.67]More.
[93:27.24]Get a couple of grates in here.
[93:28.20]Come on.
[93:30.44]That's fine.
[93:37.92]Did I just do that too many times in a row?
[93:46.37]Did I fuck that up?
[93:49.24]Did I do mint leaf before that?
[93:52.38]Sometimes I just forget.
[93:55.65]Ooh, 18!
[93:56.81]Hell yeah, that's a ton of increase.
[94:03.24]Alright, mint leaf, quick drill.
[94:20.55]Not oil.
[94:21.43]Heavy drill.
[94:37.24]Hopefully he's not... How close are we to... Okay.
[94:43.65]We're kind of running out of time here.
[94:45.19]I've got...
[94:48.78]About what?
[94:50.14]Eight months?
[94:51.06]Seven months?
[94:53.06]Errantry is going to take one whole month.
[94:55.79]So I have like six months.
[95:15.78]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[95:16.17]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[95:18.43]Almost there.
[95:24.20]No, don't give him that!
[95:27.24]Alright, he's almost at 600.
[95:48.70]I hope he gets something crazy and I hope he uses it and gets killed in one hit.
[96:10.51]Send this guy to the slots?
[96:12.97]What do you mean the slots?
[96:18.50]Somebody says you're very drunk.
[96:21.83]Why do you think I'm drunk?
[96:33.77]I'm not drunk.
[96:35.15]Or are you drunk?
[96:38.42]Have a little bit of water.
[96:39.94]Bring some water now.
[96:52.95]In my mind, the second you start typing how drunk you are, it's time to... that's the time to turn to water.
[97:14.58]I can't wait to have a character that's like 800 int.
[97:18.12]Gonna blow all the boys away.
[97:22.43]and be like, what the, how did he do that?
[97:24.73]And I'm gonna be, I'm gonna cross my arms and I'm gonna have a smug look on my face and I go, don't you wish you knew?
[97:49.72]Alright, 650.
[97:52.04]He has 650 int.
[97:56.21]We're ready.
[98:00.51]Send him on the sharp errantry.
[98:06.62]Let's do a rest.
[98:11.17]Hey, tell me to go to bed.
[98:12.01]I'm a wreck.
[98:14.94]Go to bed.
[98:15.78]Okay, if you're typing how much of a wreck you are and you need to go to bed because you're that tired, it's time to drink a little bit of water and go to bed.
[98:26.54]Alright, let's go for it.
[98:29.38]This is it.
[98:30.24]Everything is coming down to this.
[98:31.74]Okay, sharp tech.
[98:39.17]Boom.
[98:41.35]Let's do it.
[98:45.67]If I get this move, I'm gonna obliterate everybody.
[99:19.18]Sorry, I had a little bit of extra saliva.
[99:31.58]Icequake.
[99:45.83]I'll take the speed too.
[99:47.43]Speed is not... This would be good.
[99:55.82]Fishing Hamlet.
[99:56.62]That did kind of sound like the Fishing Hamlet Bloodborne enemies.
[100:05.73]Definitely scared the absolute hell out of me.
[100:11.58]When you go down that well in Bloodborne, in the Hamlet,
[100:16.69]If you don't do that area where you do the... What is it?
[100:22.16]You have to use the dagger on one of them to make them fight each other.
[100:24.69]The two giant shark enemies that are down there.
[100:27.49]That's one of the hardest rooms in any FromSoftware game.
[100:29.69]Period.
[100:31.06]If you don't take them out one by one or do the trick where you use the bone or the dagger or whatever to turn them on each other.
[100:39.23]That's one of the hardest rooms in any game FromSoftware made.
[100:49.70]Alright, this is kind of crazy.
[100:52.99]What's the new move?
[100:56.83]Oh!
[101:00.58]Ladies and gentlemen, and your winner of the Jerma Presents Monster Rancher 2 Tournament, Jerma!
[101:11.07]That's me!
[101:11.87]Everybody!
[101:19.23]And then I come down and I grab the mic.
[101:21.90]Thank you.
[101:22.54]Thank you, everybody.
[101:23.58]Thanks for coming.
[101:24.44]Oh, what a journey it was.
[101:29.21]What a journey.
[101:30.00]I didn't think I was going to win.
[101:31.18]I had no idea.
[101:47.03]Oh, and by the way, it's also my birthday, so if we could all sing, everybody in the crowd sing happy birthday to me, I would be so shocked!
[102:05.12]Okay.
[102:06.57]He can now... He can now retire until the tournament.
[102:14.03]Okay, don't... I don't want him to die.
[102:17.55]Everything else sucks.
[102:20.54]Okay, he really does have to kill things in one hit.
[102:24.64]He has it.
[102:25.65]Eye beam.
[102:27.75]Alright.
[102:29.99]The question is, will he use it?
[102:43.31]You need to get him some skill?
[102:44.87]Okay.
[102:45.22]Okay.
[102:46.73]I think we focus on skill.
[102:50.32]Should I get him to like 700 and something crazy?
[102:53.02]I want to have a wow factor when this guy comes up to the plate.
[102:56.73]Try him out in a match.
[103:02.14]No, he'll die.
[103:02.92]What if he dies?
[103:15.28]Speed and skill now, if I were you.
[103:21.69]Yeah.
[103:25.54]Okay, we'll do speed and skill.
[103:27.92]We'll do it right.
[103:42.10]What is it?
[103:42.90]Oh, you do actually get in from this.
[103:52.88]I'm thinking he'll be at 700 int.
[103:55.08]Hopefully about 200 speed.
[104:00.59]Okay, that's fine.
[104:17.72]And then we'll get him to... We'll do a skill.
[104:20.08]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[104:21.04]Because what if he does it great?
[104:22.99]He needs to be able to hit something.
[104:26.25]If his skill is terrible, then he'll have a terrible percentage to hit.
[104:32.58]So we'll do this until his second birthday.
[104:42.31]Ooh, yep.
[104:43.87]Okay.
[104:50.58]If he gets hit by a power move, he's fucked.
[104:54.06]That's good, but if they get hit by my move, they're also dead.
[105:16.23]That's why you need more speed.
[105:18.49]Yeah, I'll do it.
[105:19.07]I'll alternate.
[105:19.63]That's a good idea.
[105:20.21]I'll go speed, skill, speed, skill.
[105:22.59]We'll get in from this as well.
[105:24.79]I hope to get over 200 speed.
[105:28.18]Before this is all said and done.
[105:45.98]Good.
[105:50.31]How much time do I realistically have?
[106:01.31]I want ice candy.
[106:06.04]That looks awesome.
[106:07.12]Yeah, you can have one.
[106:12.02]300 skills should be enough.
[106:15.39]I think you're right.
[106:23.35]Yeah, we'll check how Lee is here.
[106:43.59]Least favorite beer?
[106:45.61]I really don't like heavy, heavy beers.
[106:47.85]I'm not like a big Guinness fan.
[106:51.06]I've always called Guinness liquid bread.
[106:54.33]It's just too much.
[107:07.54]Okay.
[107:07.66]Three months.
[107:09.34]That's definitely enough time.
[107:10.88]We're gonna change that, uh, that int.
[107:13.49]That int is a little too diabolical.
[107:16.69]What if I kept it there?
[107:18.29]And that was, uh, like a statement to everybody else.
[107:27.28]uh no he's gonna get in from the speed so never mind alright coming down to the stretch here
[107:58.61]was the last thing I did shoot right yes alright he's starting to slow down a little I need way more speed than that
[108:31.00]Guinness is like the Vegemite of beers.
[108:35.18]I know exactly what you mean by that.
[108:39.81]You like Hefeweizen.
[108:41.09]I do, yeah.
[108:43.61]One of my favorite beers a long time ago was Circus Boy.
[108:49.52]You guys remember Circus Boy by... Who made that?
[108:56.47]Oh my god, what company made that?
[108:59.84]No, not Red Stripe.
[109:01.44]Magic Hat, that's the one, yep.
[109:03.36]Magic Hat had some awesome beers.
[109:06.18]And Circus Boy was one of them.
[109:07.55]It was an unfiltered Hefeweizen beer.
[109:12.41]This thing looked like it was full of sea monkeys.
[109:15.71]It was crazy looking.
[109:17.12]Tasted great, though.
[109:24.84]Okay.
[109:25.89]What did I just do?
[109:31.76]What was the last thing I just did?
[109:33.19]Did I feed him anything yet?
[109:36.29]I just gave him nut oil, right?
[109:37.99]What was the last thing I did?
[109:42.60]I just did nut oil, okay.
[109:44.80]Did I?
[109:48.15]So now I- okay, alright.
[109:50.59]Oh fuck, I didn't want to do this!
[109:53.68]Shit!
[109:56.92]Oh yeah, actually, maybe I did!
[109:58.32]Let's go!
[110:02.34]Ooh!
[110:19.68]Dude.
[110:21.28]Duuude.
[110:23.40]Oh, he's so good.
[110:27.92]Do you like hard cider?
[110:29.42]I do.
[110:30.71]Down east is an east coast thing.
[110:33.55]It was mainly, I think, a Boston thing.
[110:35.77]But down east cider, if you're on the east coast and you're able to get it, that's the best cider, hard cider that you can possibly get.
[110:41.96]Without a doubt.
[110:45.70]...
[110:59.73]Do you ever have Mind Goblin?
[111:01.13]I have not.
[111:02.16]It's been a long time since I've had, um, much hard anything, really.
[111:07.98]Hard cider, hard lemonade, whatever.
[111:09.94]You just fell for it?
[111:14.71]I don't know, dude, everything has a da- every marijuana strain, every beer, like, oh fu- like, funky town!
[111:22.10]Okay, I'm sorry, yeah, I don't know what the fuck you asked me to- I don't know what I just said!
[111:28.20]mind goblin deez nuts oh my god well whatever okay you got me
[111:56.32]Okay, we're good on skill, I think.
[111:58.26]I'm gonna do... I'm gonna go back between speed and... Speed and int, I think, is how I'm gonna end this out.
[112:13.08]Two months.
[112:15.08]How's he doing?
[112:15.54]Let's see the whole card.
[112:17.32]Alright.
[112:18.93]He's gonna die from... He's gonna die from one hit.
[112:23.65]He has no defense.
[112:26.15]He's dead in one punch, but I also am one punch man.
[112:30.58]I'm one laser beam eye man.
[112:33.96]So that's the way it is.
[112:35.00]That's what this character's strength is going to be.
[112:52.74]Alright, he's got 700 int.
[112:56.81]Maybe I just should go all in on speed now.
[113:08.83]No, keep the skill up.
[113:10.71]Some people are probably going to do the weird thing where they just do all speed.
[113:14.88]I wouldn't be surprised if somebody was going to do that.
[113:20.84]What's your favorite wine?
[113:21.65]Malbec.
[113:24.10]A nice Malbec is up there.
[113:48.80]Now Beck deez nuts.
[113:50.41]That doesn't work.
[113:51.23]That does not work the way that you want it to.
[113:56.83]Somebody got me earlier and that means now everyone's gonna try just to get me by writing anything.
[114:02.50]Then deez nuts after it.
[114:08.51]You're not gonna get me, okay?
[114:10.15]It's not gonna get me.
[114:14.30]Nice.
[114:19.38]I might be able to get to 400 skill.
[114:33.17]I think going over 200 speed would be perfect.
[114:48.63]Oh fuck!
[114:49.23]That's it!
[114:49.85]It's over!
[114:53.27]Oh, that's it!
[114:54.39]Pencil's down!
[115:00.78]Beeeechug!
[115:06.93]I thought I still had another couple of weeks left.
[115:08.65]Shit.
[115:09.34]I didn't get to 200 speed.
[115:14.76]I got all my monsters.
[115:15.71]We'll go through them.
[115:18.29]Pencils down on them all.
[115:22.52]Can you test them in a battle?
[115:23.84]Yeah, I can test them in a battle.
[115:24.76]I'll save it and just have them fight.
[115:30.95]Let's take a look.
[115:34.38]I mean, that's pretty damn good.
[115:38.41]If I do that laser beam to anybody, they're gonna die.
[115:41.57]Uh...
[115:42.85]That's a decent amount of skill.
[115:44.15]I shouldn't miss that frequently.
[115:45.43]I'm very concerned about this and this.
[115:49.27]And this, kind of.
[115:55.34]Uh, let me save it.
[115:58.83]And we will take him.
[115:59.61]I just want to have him.
[116:00.81]Just to see what he does.
[116:04.11]And then we'll go through and see all of our other friends.
[116:09.50]After I come back, I'm going to the bathroom.
[116:12.17]I'll be right back.
[116:14.34]See you in three minutes.
[116:18.74]And then after we do this, we'll do a fight with this guy just to make sure you see how he's doing.
[116:24.01]We'll go compare everybody.
[116:25.61]I'll show you all my monsters.
[116:27.55]And then I'm ready.
[116:29.22]And then we'll move to a dark room.
[116:33.16]So if you're going to stick around for the rest of this, I'll be back in a few minutes.
[116:36.18]And we'll keep going.
[116:38.93]See you in a few minutes.
[116:42.46]Thank you.
[117:20.38]I don't know what I'm doing here.
[117:49.90]Thank you.
[118:26.16]so so so so so
[118:55.49]I don't know.
[119:23.87]I don't know.
[119:24.15]I don't know.
[119:24.43]I don't know.
[119:33.21]I'm back.
[119:41.65]Somebody said, what happened to the BRB screen?
[119:42.94]I need better, yeah, I need like better, I need my original BRB screen back, but I also want some more too.
[119:49.36]I want to put some more interesting things on the BRBs.
[119:59.53]I had an interesting idea, but I couldn't do it.
[120:05.37]I ran into an issue where, like I told you this before, I was going to have to label every single one of my streams as a real life gambling stream.
[120:16.29]And even no one was using money.
[120:19.09]There was no real money at all, but I would have to do that.
[120:29.13]I was going to have a coin pusher that was going to take channel points.
[120:35.26]Let's just put it all on the table.
[120:36.80]Why not?
[120:37.10]Fuck it.
[120:37.34]I was like, you know, who cares?
[120:38.87]I was going to have a coin pusher where you guys could do channel points during a BRB screen, like while ads are playing.
[120:47.84]And you would drop tokens into a pusher and try to push coins off and stuff.
[120:55.05]And in the machine, there was going to be stuff in there.
[120:58.13]There was going to be folded up pieces of paper.
[121:00.26]Oh, look, a card.
[121:01.58]Oh, look, it's like SpongeBob cards.
[121:03.46]Like goofy shit like that.
[121:05.32]On the folded up piece of paper, it might be, oh, he needs to play Minecraft for an hour.
[121:10.17]Like you would be able to push that off, potentially.
[121:13.15]It'd be a little like toys.
[121:14.38]I wanted to have like a little prize container for chat.
[121:19.34]Where there was, if you push something off...
[121:23.43]Then, oh, look, let's take a look and see what you guys have for prizes.
[121:27.04]That is real money gambling.
[121:29.36]I couldn't do it.
[121:29.90]That is what I was told.
[121:39.42]I could do it.
[121:41.86]But if I did it, I would have to check the box for every stream that I did.
[121:49.25]to try to make the stream real money gambling stream and like it is that is effectively fucks up the channel in a lot of ways I would have to be labeled as a real money gambler forever but
[122:14.89]And then there was like other alternative ideas where it's, okay, it's the nature of having a coin pusher, we can't do that.
[122:20.39]I was like, well, what if I do something else?
[122:22.20]And it's like, okay, well, what do I even want to do?
[122:26.16]Oh, I know that guy.
[122:27.00]That's Jerma, the real money gambler.
[122:34.37]Channel points aren't real money.
[122:37.68]Uh, yeah.
[122:39.44]Yes.
[122:40.64]I would agree with you.
[122:49.26]but anyways let's keep going double or nothing I buy my groceries with your channel points yeah that would be crazy alright so let's take let's take him to town
[123:23.55]Yeah, I was going to go all in with this.
[123:25.47]This was going to be... I was going to buy an old coin token machine pusher and customize it.
[123:32.30]I was going to do a full gut job on it and have some people come out and do a whole customization thing with it.
[123:40.48]Where you guys could pick where you want to drop it and stuff.
[123:44.15]But that idea is, unfortunately, it's down the toilet.
[123:56.76]But you do it digitally?
[123:58.56]I really wanted it to be real.
[123:59.99]I feel like it's more fun that way.
[124:02.54]I want the tangible... machine.
[124:05.06]That's what I wanted.
[124:06.93]With the noises, the... I think it's way more hype.
[124:20.76]Why does he look sad?
[124:21.86]I think he was just tired from the last thing we did.
[124:25.02]Alright, let's, uh, I want to take him to a fight.
[124:27.91]Let's see how he does.
[124:28.57]This is non-official.
[124:30.56]This is not a canon tournament.
[124:31.94]I just wanted to, I want to just check and see how he does.
[124:47.06]You should check with Twitch.
[124:48.97]I went back and forth with Twitch for like two months about this.
[124:51.39]So... I did.
[124:53.75]Maybe you could do like a claw machine?
[125:12.42]I've told you guys this before, but... I...
[125:19.01]I, if I have something that I want to do, I don't want to turn it into something else.
[125:24.78]Do you know what I mean?
[125:26.56]If it's like, Hey, I've got something I think would be really cool.
[125:28.14]Something I think is awesome and will be awesome.
[125:30.16]Maybe I think it'd be great for the channel, for the community.
[125:32.93]Oh, but what if you just do something else?
[125:35.35]That's not what I wanted to do.
[125:36.89]So no.
[125:39.27]Uncompromising.
[125:40.15]I mean, call it what you want, but I, I know if it's something that I wanted to do,
[125:44.35]In my own space, in my own channel, I want to do it.
[125:48.14]And if there's something that I think is cool, I think it's worth doing.
[125:51.97]I don't want to change it into something else that I didn't think was cool.
[125:58.64]And wowee, this guy is great.
[126:05.13]You should go see a therapist?
[126:07.31]What?
[126:08.97]What?
[126:13.23]This is a D tournament.
[126:16.83]I shouldn't be here.
[126:17.71]Okay, this is the ultimate smurf.
[126:21.50]I have... This was not going to give us any reliable data.
[126:26.71]This is not reliable data.
[126:28.09]I should drop out.
[126:29.51]I'm going to kill some of these people.
[126:34.42]Yeah, this is not alright.
[126:35.84]I...
[126:37.06]this is okay this is like you know in little league when it's uh it's only nine ten and eleven year olds and it's like well what about like yeah uh what about like little little Johnny here he's he's like 14 he could play in little league still right oh no this is like uh you this is little league and I'm a like major league baseball pitcher
[127:06.25]I just wanted to see what his reaction was to doing these things.
[127:10.12]Alright, well, he's obviously not going to do, he's going to do tail assault most of the time.
[127:22.28]Okay, we can't.
[127:23.14]We're done.
[127:23.48]He's done.
[127:41.16]Uh, I'll just finish it up because it'll make him happy.
[127:49.13]He's not even in his prime yet.
[127:50.94]I probably could have gotten to a thousand int on this character.
[128:04.13]Big dodge.
[128:06.07]Huge dodge.
[128:14.00]I mean, he is dodging punches from nine-year-olds.
[128:17.39]Which is still difficult, I would imagine, right?
[128:19.37]That's probably still hard.
[128:20.19]It would be still difficult.
[128:34.68]Oh, got him!
[128:35.62]Nice, dude!
[128:38.85]Nine-year-olds are quick, right?
[128:40.27]Nine-year-olds are quick.
[128:43.28]See?
[128:43.84]He was fast.
[128:44.62]He was still hard to dodge.
[129:10.24]Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
[129:20.54]He is doing that.
[129:22.38]He's doing that thing you're doing.
[129:25.17]Oh, that's funny.
[129:30.21]He gained so many fans from fighting children.
[129:35.18]How sick is this audience?
[129:42.47]Okay, I cannot take these stats.
[129:43.89]We already saved it.
[129:52.15]This game is dishonest.
[130:04.57]What do you mean dishonest?
[130:10.80]Okay.
[130:11.46]So.
[130:13.02]He's pretty tired.
[130:14.90]It's alright.
[130:15.60]He's saved already.
[130:16.44]So let's go back to town.
[130:20.43]And let's take an assessment of who we got, because what's really important is this.
[130:31.95]If I have to pick one monster for each bracket, who do we pick first?
[130:40.51]Can I see their stats?
[130:48.16]There we go.
[130:48.64]Okay.
[130:50.88]So this is, this is, that's what I do.
[130:53.96]Very balanced.
[130:54.78]I made sure just to have him across the board balanced.
[130:58.89]200 health, 400, 200, 200.
[131:03.00]He's kind of just, I feel like I go, I don't know.
[131:06.06]Do you go balanced first?
[131:07.20]Because what if other people do crazy shit?
[131:16.67]I don't think anybody's killing Yermit, by the way.
[131:20.30]500 health.
[131:23.32]I think I might start with Yermit.
[131:31.71]Oh my god.
[131:32.97]Maybe I'll just start with Butchug and... Sorry, Brian.
[131:36.50]And, uh... And just see if I can melt everybody.
[131:41.28]I don't know.
[131:45.95]These stats aren't even close to Criken's drugged-up monster.
[131:48.88]700 int?
[131:52.10]How many... What do you mean he's not even close?
[131:57.05]I got 700 int!
[131:57.91]What do you... Yeah, don't spoil it!
[132:04.96]Don't spoil it!
[132:09.47]You need to go higher?
[132:10.37]I... That's it!
[132:11.45]I'm... I... This is... These are my characters!
[132:15.30]Hey, you can say that all you want.
[132:17.78]All it takes is one laser beam to do 400 damage and instantly kill anybody.
[132:29.70]He's got 700 int, but he's built like a Cinderella shoe.
[132:41.49]Alright, I got my guys, I'm good, whatever.
[132:46.59]If somebody has like a 2000 drugged up power character, they still need to get in that ring and actually execute and perform.
[132:56.98]We've seen it time and time again.
[132:59.27]Yeah, that's fine.
[132:59.89]If you have 900 power, your monster still has to walk forward and do a move.
[133:06.19]What if he just doesn't do a move and just dies?
[133:09.34]We've seen it time and time again.
[133:18.16]Can we scan a couple more albums just to see what they are?
[133:23.13]Yeah, sure.
[133:24.23]That sounds fun.
[133:30.56]What do you got?
[133:32.58]The game just crashed.
[133:36.53]Oh, shit.
[133:36.85]That's the first time this game's ever crashed.
[133:38.89]Squeaks was telling me his game was crashing all the time.
[133:43.48]Okay, well, never mind.
[133:48.28]Let me just make sure the save is fine.
[133:50.98]Just my luck, my save file will be corrupted.
[133:53.43]Let me just make sure it isn't.
[134:03.22]Jesus.
[134:06.13]Glad I turned that down for you.
[134:18.54]It's good, right?
[134:21.52]Yeah it is, right?
[134:29.11]I think we're good.
[134:37.43]I saved it right before coming here, so...
[134:40.95]Alright, I will pull five albums.
[134:44.77]We'll do ten pulls because I know you guys like that.
[134:47.89]I know you guys, you're big fans of that.
[134:52.80]Yeah, he's good.
[135:00.53]Alright, I'm going to be pulling out stuff from the chat.
[135:01.99]What do you guys want?
[135:05.23]Remember, it's got to be albums, artists.
[135:08.15]Do something from Korn.
[135:22.32]Uh, what should I do?
[135:27.27]What's a Korn album?
[135:40.70]Freak on a Leash.
[135:42.56]Oh, that's right.
[135:44.82]Is Freak on a Leash the name of the album?
[135:58.69]Okay, there it is.
[136:00.51]Alright, let's see what we get from Freak on a Leash.
[136:15.33]Holy shit, why am I- why wasn't I a huge fan of Korn?
[136:19.50]Why wasn't I a big fan of Korn?
[136:20.88]This thing's crazy!
[136:26.55]Oh man!
[136:27.77]This thing is awesome!
[136:36.10]The stats of... That speed is insane to start with.
[136:39.59]That's an insane base speed.
[136:47.78]Okay.
[136:48.50]Give me another couple.
[136:51.48]Alright, what about Paranoid Android?
[136:53.45]That's actually would be one of... That's like in the top five for me probably.
[137:03.03]I can't type.
[137:11.73]Ballpark?
[137:12.77]Wait, ballpark music?
[137:16.90]What is that?
[137:17.58]Is that playing at baseball games?
[137:21.64]OK Computer is the album, right?
[137:36.33]It's definitely in here.
[137:40.99]Really?
[137:50.45]Ah!
[138:00.27]Okay, well... I'm just gonna pick that one.
[138:05.03]I'm going to pick the one from Ballpark Music.
[138:10.22]It's probably some compilation that has it on there.
[138:22.29]But this is definitely in my top 10 songs of all time.
[138:26.06]Watch it be something amazing.
[138:30.85]How... Why did I...
[138:33.25]Why are there so many monsters cooler than Rainbow Connection?
[138:47.77]Pretty, that's good.
[138:49.01]That's actually great base stats.
[139:04.38]uh try Pink Floyd uh they have the trial that's my favorite that's like my favorite Pink Floyd song um the evidence before the court
[139:39.08]These are albums, right?
[139:40.96]What album was it on?
[139:43.64]They only have songs if there were singles.
[139:45.32]What album was... I mean, this is Pink Floyd.
[139:50.11]It's on the wall, right?
[139:51.15]Yeah.
[139:53.93]So they have the wall.
[140:01.70]The wall of flowers.
[140:15.05]I know I'm typing like I'm shit-faced.
[140:16.76]I'm just reaching.
[140:17.58]I mean, it's just, I'm gonna have to just do the wall from Pink Floyd, right?
[140:43.51]Oh my god!
[140:46.45]Don't- Okay, if people pretend that this is their favorite fucking song, this thing is insane!
[140:51.00]What is this?
[140:51.36]It's like a giant dragon!
[140:52.60]Holy shit, these monsters are so cool!
[140:59.19]It's an Int monster, what?
[141:08.67]Do a Prince album?
[141:20.29]1999.
[141:36.09]Weird.
[141:37.67]It's like one of those cats, but it's a robot.
[141:44.50]Damn.
[141:50.09]192 skill base.
[141:56.89]Alright, let's do two more.
[141:59.37]We want Bjork, OK?
[142:09.11]OK, this one.
[142:18.95]Talking heads.
[142:20.41]I'll do talking heads after this.
[142:23.70]Oh boy.
[142:28.66]Big... Big monster.
[142:38.20]It probably scales crazy with power in life.
[142:43.59]Whoa.
[142:47.39]Uh, I will do talking heads.
[142:59.40]What?
[143:00.62]Did I spell it wrong?
[143:06.59]I'm sorry.
[143:06.85]I'm a hundred.
[143:14.16]Really?
[143:28.00]How about the ultimate collection?
[143:30.33]Black Sabbath.
[143:46.04]Okay, it's a Suezo, but it's a... Fuzzy Suezo.
[143:52.01]What is this combined with?
[143:56.38]Oh shit, it's both.
[144:02.17]It's power and int.
[144:07.20]Alright, last one for real.
[144:12.10]My Chemical Romance?
[144:15.77]Apex Twin.
[144:21.39]You should do Sandman.
[144:22.62]Look at how everyone just like... Do this song!
[144:28.96]Uh, okay, we'll do...
[144:39.79]Backstreet Boys would probably be something crazy.
[144:47.04]Which one?
[144:59.34]Window Licker?
[145:03.01]Alright, let's see.
[145:12.58]Looks big.
[145:16.00]Holy shit.
[145:21.57]Is this a unique monster?
[145:24.35]Whoa!
[145:25.61]Is it anybody's favorite song?
[145:27.19]Anybody's favorite band?
[145:29.56]Who's in this tournament that... Okay, that's... This is crazy.
[145:32.88]This thing's insane.
[145:38.27]236 base int.
[145:40.52]187 this is a crazy base stats somebody will dominate the whole tournament it's an electric phoenix I hold I want to see what is it combined with
[146:24.13]So this is a... birdy buttchug.
[146:29.18]This is a mustardy yermit.
[146:31.12]This is a galley?
[146:32.20]That's what I do.
[146:33.94]Ghost little guy.
[146:35.64]Selketo Miku Crab.
[146:37.11]And a Cinderbird Woe.
[146:40.13]So this is a... main is a phoenix.
[146:42.50]And it's sub?
[146:43.12]It doesn't... it doesn't know.
[146:53.41]Oh, this is a Zoom and a Suezo.
[146:57.21]Really?
[146:57.53]This is nothing.
[147:01.24]This is just a Gallus Gallus.
[147:03.30]This is not combined with anything.
[147:05.40]How rare is that?
[147:05.98]Is that hard to get that?
[147:08.27]A double with no sub?
[147:12.71]This doesn't have a sub either.
[147:16.08]Yermert sucks, dude.
[147:18.44]I can't change it.
[147:22.19]The little guy sucks?
[147:23.29]I don't think so, man.
[147:24.14]I think you just do a ton of speed.
[147:26.54]And just never get hit.
[147:28.60]And try to do a little bit of damage and go to time on every single fight.
[147:36.67]Alright, I'm good.
[147:37.83]I'm ready to... Let's play some Dark Room.
[147:42.17]So this game's interesting.
[147:44.62]Dark Room is an old browser game.
[147:47.58]And I was fighting with if I should play the browser version or play the one that's on Steam.
[147:51.96]the developer ported it to Steam and I think Switch and stuff so there's apparently some new content in the new one the Steam one has some new stuff in it I kind of have to get used to the menu though but I played this game a ton of times in the browser version but it's on Steam and I'm gonna try the one on Steam
[148:17.53]This game is pretty slow.
[148:19.65]It's just kind of a hangout game.
[148:20.91]I'm just going to play it.
[148:22.72]You guys can obviously help.
[148:24.68]To an extent.
[148:26.84]Before I... What I'm probably going to do... I'm probably going to go sub only.
[148:29.47]40 minute sub only mode.
[148:31.75]Just to let you know.
[148:36.18]Let's just change to it right now.
[148:42.41]Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[148:46.60]But yeah, I'm looking forward to see what people do with their monsters.
[148:48.82]And I know I give people homework, but I love going back and watching everyone's homework to see their journey.
[148:59.18]Originally, I thought it would be kind of funny to have people make videos.
[149:05.84]Have like, oh, the journey, like a 30 second intro for each character.
[149:11.37]But that's even more homework.
[149:13.49]So I'm not doing that.
