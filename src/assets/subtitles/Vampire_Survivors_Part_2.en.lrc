[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.34]Alright, I'm going to play... Okay, I have to admit something to you.
[00:05.44]I played Vampire Survivors off stream.
[00:07.16]I know.
[00:07.38]I'm sorry.
[00:11.17]We're going to play a little bit, though.
[00:12.81]I unlocked some stuff.
[00:16.25]I know.
[00:16.49]People are going to be mad.
[00:17.35]Like, played without us.
[00:18.31]Played without us.
[00:19.07]Yeah.
[00:19.21]Alright, give me one second.
[00:20.85]I'm going to switch.
[00:28.46]That was creepy.
[00:28.80]Okay.
[00:32.11]That was creepy.
[00:34.87]Maybe I'll do, like, one or two rounds, just to kind of palate cleanse that weird experience, right?
[00:49.32]Did you like it?
[00:51.56]I mean, you can't... How do you like that experience, right?
[00:54.76]It's kind of awful.
[00:56.48]But it did, like, it did what it was trying to do and, like, kind of freak you out and make you feel awful.
[01:03.22]You know what I mean?
[01:04.12]It's like, oh, dude, didn't you love that?
[01:07.70]No.
[01:08.95]I hated that.
[01:09.73]It sucked.
[01:11.81]But that's exactly what they were going for, right?
[01:14.29]So, I mean, yeah, it did what it was doing, what it was trying to do.
[01:21.46]So, yeah.
[01:23.26]Alright, Vampire Survivors, coming up.
[01:35.18]Cool.
[01:37.98]Yeah, we need a little bit of a detox here.
[01:39.38]Yeah.
[01:41.69]Ooh, that's loud.
[01:46.71]What's the title right now?
[01:51.31]Haunted Coffee Shop.
[01:54.35]Winding down with some Vampire Survivors.
[02:04.91]That's pretty accurate.
[02:10.24]So yeah, I unlocked a few more weapons.
[02:12.38]Holly and I are playing it.
[02:13.16]Because I kind of couldn't get enough, so, you know.
[02:20.95]Your titles went from amazing to dog shit.
[02:25.21]Yeah, but dog, I mean, I've... Whatever.
[02:38.51]So the last thing that I did... I can turn it up a little bit.
[02:41.67]That's too low.
[02:46.30]Oh, I want to go over this too, because this is something that is very new.
[02:50.54]So... I'm going to talk to Ludwig, but we might need to move a few things around.
[02:57.02]Because we planned on Friday for being that kind of PvP night.
[03:00.20]But I think we need a little bit more time.
[03:02.34]We'll see.
[03:04.29]Um, on Friday, I'm going to do something that I've never done before.
[03:09.15]This is something that's brand new to the channel, and some of you in pre-stream already know what I'm talking about.
[03:14.10]I'm doing my first ever sponsored game stream.
[03:18.76]That's for real, not a joke.
[03:21.33]There's been... I remember a few months ago when I signed with Evolved, and they were going to start doing sponsorships, and some of the bigger streams will have more sponsors, and I'll be able to try to make some extra money to be able to do some more of these things.
[03:37.02]There's been quite a few things that I could have done already, and I said no, but I'm very selective.
[03:46.34]The thing that's happening on Friday, the game looks fun.
[03:48.78]I actually went in and played the demo, and I was like, oh, this actually seems pretty cool.
[03:54.02]The game is The Serpent Rogue.
[03:58.79]It actually looks really fun.
[04:02.59]It's something that looks pretty interesting.
[04:09.05]It's all about the money, isn't it?
[04:14.45]I thought it was going to be a different game.
[04:16.11]No.
[04:16.61]Okay.
[04:17.53]Let me be really clear with this.
[04:21.59]Sponsors on this stream, I'm going to be pretty selective on.
[04:27.73]Right?
[04:29.33]If something looks like it's something I'd be interested in, something that I think would be cool, or that I think would be, oh, this looks like it might be fun to play, then yeah.
[04:40.35]If there's an opportunity, then yeah.
[04:42.16]But I'm not just going to do something just because just to do it.
[04:45.06]That's just not going to happen.
[04:47.86]So I would rather have those things happen naturally than just...
[04:53.06]Oh, yeah, sure.
[04:54.01]I'll do anything.
[04:56.33]So I can at least try to tell you that anything that's a sponsor on this stream is something that I have like used before.
[05:02.03]I mean, I thought was interesting or that I thought like, actually, that makes sense.
[05:05.48]I could kind of gel with the community, right?
[05:09.13]So, I mean, every sponsor is going to be... Yes, I'm sponsored to play it.
[05:14.82]Yes, I'm sponsored to show it.
[05:17.10]But I have the opportunity to be able to say yes or no.
[05:20.38]Every time.
[05:22.24]So... You should run ads as well.
[05:27.07]Let's not talk... Let's not get there yet.
[05:29.73]Let's not get there yet.
[05:32.47]I don't think so.
[05:33.63]I don't think that's going to have to happen for any reason.
[05:40.28]Yeah, the Serpent Row.
[05:41.00]It looks fun.
[05:41.86]It looks actually really cool.
[05:42.78]It's a game where it's like an action adventure where you make potions and shit.
[05:46.24]I actually looked... I was looking, you know, played the demo.
[05:50.14]Seems pretty good.
[05:51.70]Yet.
[05:52.17]No.
[05:53.67]Can you monetize your breath yet?
[05:55.37]Alright, I unlocked some people.
[05:59.81]I want to show you who they are because they're cool.
[06:03.79]I unlocked this guy, Ramba.
[06:06.78]This O'Soul.
[06:08.48]This was pretty cool, this dog.
[06:11.11]excited you deserve the opportunities but I don't I don't want to just do it just to do it right and I mean eventually some of the idea behind some of this stuff is okay subs and bits
[06:29.95]Don't, like... You guys don't, like, need to do that, right?
[06:34.23]If I get to a point where I'm making more money through sponsorships, then subs, do you guys... You can just fucking watch.
[06:41.87]You know what I mean?
[06:44.24]And you don't have to worry about that.
[06:46.70]And even now, even right now, you don't have to worry about that.
[06:50.34]So... I'm trying to make a reasonable balance.
[06:55.26]And obviously, obviously...
[06:59.37]I'm trying to make some money too because not just for the big shows right because big shows really are expensive and some of these shows are half kind of paid for but not really and then we have to figure out how to get the rest uh but some of these opportunities some of these projects I mean they're they're potentially in the hundreds of thousands of dollars hundreds of thousands
[07:22.72]So I want to make sure that I'm going to be able to pay for them and like not have to worry about it, right?
[07:28.62]So that's the long and short of it.
[07:33.86]I want to try to be transparent.
[07:39.71]This greedy motherfucker.
[07:45.49]Don't worry about it, bro.
[07:48.21]Yeah, but I've never done it before, ever.
[07:53.19]And it's something that I always said if I was going to ever do it, that I would want to make sure I was kind of on my own terms, right?
[08:06.46]I unlock these too, yeah.
[08:07.55]Alright, let's do XP.
[08:10.17]A lot of XP.
[08:13.51]Cool down area and speed and magnet.
[08:17.27]Okay.
[08:21.29]And don't get me wrong, like I said, there's been at least a few opportunities that I've just been like, uh, no, I don't think so.
[08:33.25]Just straight up.
[08:35.80]And that's going to continue to happen, alright?
[08:37.14]That's going to keep happening.
[08:39.98]Okay, so I need to survive on green acres.
[08:43.80]This is going to be hard.
[08:46.40]Random enemy waves from normal stages and enemy health plus 50%.
[08:49.88]This is gonna be fucking hard.
[08:51.16]Alright, let's go for it.
[08:54.36]Enjoy your bitrate.
[08:57.11]So, uh, this dog spits out these flowers that shoot up behind you.
[09:00.71]They're pretty cool.
[09:07.63]This music is pretty good, too.
[09:14.79]160p.
[09:15.67]That was a good title.
[09:16.51]What was wrong with that one?
[09:17.93]Oh, I unlocked this too.
[09:18.71]This is, uh, these are guns.
[09:20.57]Fires quickly in four fixed directions.
[09:22.27]See if I can get both.
[09:33.17]Why are you fighting the Wo-Soi?
[09:35.95]Wojack.
[09:39.29]This is 50% more health than random enemies.
[09:41.40]I haven't even tried this one.
[09:45.10]Uh, I mean, I love lightning.
[09:46.62]Lightning rod is like the best.
[09:47.52]But that's Friday.
[09:52.19]And Friday we were thinking of doing the Elden Ring PvP stuff, but I gotta talk to Ludwig because we gotta figure out how that's gonna play out.
[09:59.66]I think we need a little bit more time.
[10:12.84]Oh god.
[10:14.16]Yeah, we'll chill for a little bit.
[10:15.36]I'll play a round or two.
[10:16.38]See if I can beat the game at least once.
[10:21.17]They have way more health.
[10:22.15]This actually is kind of hard.
[10:30.01]So the next stream will be on Friday.
[10:32.01]That's what I'm planning on.
[10:36.02]Okay.
[10:37.58]Damage?
[10:41.32]What do I have?
[10:41.78]I need the Duplicator Ring, the other gun.
[10:44.63]I need Tiramisu.
[10:46.47]I don't think the flower has it in Evolve.
[10:48.77]I think I'm just gonna Spinach.
[11:00.48]Just damage.
[11:02.38]Use the knife!
[11:03.16]Oh god.
[11:11.21]But to cap the sponsor thing... There's like a few streams this year that I really want to do.
[11:20.35]And I need to be able to pay for them.
[11:23.31]Stuff that I've always wanted to do, stuff that I really care about.
[11:26.03]And I've said this to you guys before, and I have to reiterate it sometimes.
[11:32.15]The stuff that keeps me interested is what keeps me in this chair.
[11:37.67]And that stuff, doing those shows, doing the big stuff, is what is keeping me interested.
[11:42.89]That's what keeps me interested.
[11:46.93]So, I want to try to do the things that I want to try to do.
[11:49.81]Turn up the game audio?
[11:58.44]Oh, I don't even know what I just bought.
[11:59.52]What was it?
[12:01.32]What happened?
[12:01.70]What did I just buy?
[12:05.22]Oh, I think it was another level of something?
[12:06.44]What was it?
[12:10.50]I'm crashing again.
[12:15.18]He's gone.
[12:15.82]Oh, actually gone.
[12:19.26]Um, hello?
[12:49.43]Oh no, he left the chair.
[12:51.96]He took the money and ran.
[12:53.40]He left the chair.
[13:05.53]I really hope you guys understand that the last...
[13:08.71]10 to 15 seconds is probably the most important thing I've ever said in my entire life on stream.
[13:15.74]Ever.
[13:16.28]And I really just hope you guys understand.
[13:18.32]The last probably 15 seconds is the most important.
[13:20.86]Ever.
[13:22.14]Glad you got to hear it.
[13:29.67]Oh, I like the...
[13:41.16]Oh, these guys respawn.
[13:42.20]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[13:42.94]Alright, I need some health.
[13:52.95]You know what I mean?
[14:00.82]You know... That... That is...
[14:11.59]That is so important to me.
[14:13.55]That is so important to me.
[14:20.56]That is like the most important thing.
[14:22.82]It's so important to me that you guys, that I can talk to you like this.
[14:29.17]At the last minute, I've never said anything like that ever to anybody, let alone people on a stream.
[14:38.72]No, like I'm really glad that you got to hear it the last 20 to 30 seconds again.
[14:42.76]I've never talked like that to anybody.
[14:49.16]I'm so glad that I could say it to you.
[14:53.44]Oh, I'm so happy I could get it off my chest.
[15:00.24]Huh?
[15:09.47]I think my internet is fucked up right now.
[15:15.85]It's like 10 o'clock at night.
[15:16.77]What's happening here?
[15:35.39]Ooh, I'll take the fire wand.
[15:47.65]Sorry, I'm kinda playing like shit.
[15:48.82]I'm just making sure my screen is still up.
[16:11.97]We good?
[16:12.47]Am I alright?
[16:16.29]Alright, I gotta pay attention because I'm just picking random shit.
[16:38.85]You're stuck?
[16:39.93]Uh, refresh.
[16:50.28]Yeah, refresh.
[16:50.84]We're good.
[17:01.57]Alright, there we go.
[17:02.31]Level 2.
[17:02.67]Good chest.
[17:07.97]No.
[17:08.63]Hey dude, erectile dysfunction isn't rare.
[17:13.33]You're not alone.
[17:16.50]Alright.
[17:31.12]Stop looking at chat.
[17:32.04]Yeah, I know.
[17:32.66]I'm just looking at the bitrate.
[17:34.04]I'm just concerned.
[17:34.88]Alright, there we go.
[17:40.28]Alright, I can evolve this now.
[17:42.30]The tiramisu is a revive, but it also evolves the gun.
[18:08.37]Why is everybody Omega Loading?
[18:16.42]Why is everybody Omega Loading?
[18:20.43]Omega Loading.
[18:21.05]Why is everybody Omega Loading?
[18:55.73]Whatever, it's art.
[18:58.42]I think if you have... If I get at least two more of these, I think I'll be fine.
[19:05.02]I hope so.
[19:09.88]Yeah, I mean, why is there a mega low?
[19:11.65]That's weird.
[19:16.11]Chest!
[19:16.53]Nice.
[19:26.91]Ooh, actually, I got the upgrade.
[19:28.09]That's cool.
[19:31.77]That's pretty cool.
[19:40.00]I might have to restart this run.
[19:41.06]This is not a great one.
[19:44.02]Got hit.
[19:45.20]I don't know why, why's my chat being weird?
[19:57.29]Oh, chat back out, please.
[20:25.56]That was so emotional.
[20:41.05]Sorry mods, I apologize.
[20:42.97]I think I can salvage this actually.
[20:50.29]Yeah, I'm dead.
[20:58.25]Oh, I have a revive!
[20:59.15]That's right!
[20:59.59]Oops!
[21:01.13]Sorry, I was too busy looking over.
[21:02.59]Is that a joke?
[21:05.14]Um...
[21:20.55]I'm trying to see what it looked like.
[21:29.56]You suck at this.
[21:30.32]No, I'm just not paying that much attention.
[21:38.19]Wait, was I in the chair?
[21:39.97]There was a point when I was not in the chair, right?
[21:55.26]Have I been... Wait, have I been in the chair the whole time?
[21:59.74]Like, have I been sitting in this chair the whole time?
[22:09.03]You were always in the chair.
[22:10.53]Really?
[22:10.85]Fuck.
[22:14.59]I... I killed the internet and, like, got out of frame and it came back.
[22:22.29]And it was live for like 30 seconds.
[22:24.09]And then I turned the internet, I guess, switched the internet again.
[22:26.73]I turned it back on.
[22:28.31]And I was sitting in the chair again.
[22:32.60]But it didn't work.
[22:35.50]I never left the chair.
[22:36.82]How?
[22:37.28]That makes no sense.
[22:39.74]Dude, I was live with the chair for at least a minute, at least.
[22:49.47]Like, I was not in the chair.
[22:50.99]And I crawled around the bottom.
[22:53.95]I wonder if it's here.
[22:55.79]Like, on my OBS.
[22:57.21]Because I will show you.
[22:58.89]I will... Oh, it got eaten by the buffer.
[23:09.14]Ah, but no.
[23:12.04]If I did that once, the other, like, 15 times were not a joke.
[23:21.86]I did it one time, because I was like, whatever, it's happening every fucking 30 seconds anyway.
[23:36.25]Uh, all of them were legitimate.
[23:37.69]Like, my internet just fucked up right now.
[23:41.33]Uh, except for the one that I tried to go away from the chair.
[23:48.62]Yeah, these are real.
[24:00.19]I'm dead maybe not let me let me try to salvage this one I can alright let's get some health and I should be alright
[24:36.41]Nevada is a wasteland.
[24:37.61]Okay.
[24:40.33]I died on purpose because I want to do a real one.
[24:49.10]Let's go.
[24:51.00]New title?
[24:53.86]You lost like 5k viewers from that.
[24:55.90]Well, I mean, I get, I mean, it's like a 10 o'clock at night Pacific.
[24:59.02]My internet's being a piece of shit.
[25:02.46]I swear, only one of those was a joke.
[25:04.92]The other 15 were real.
[25:06.36]So I figured it was like, alright, this is just happening anyways.
[25:08.32]Might as well try to do something funny with it.
[25:10.43]Alright, perfect.
[25:15.45]Let's go.
[25:25.66]This is the real one.
[25:26.26]This is the one I'm going to win.
[25:28.94]Alright, good, good, good, good, good.
[25:30.54]I want the whip.
[25:50.25]Because like every time there's an Elden Ring stream there's bandwidth problems.
[25:53.27]That is fucking weird.
[25:55.01]Sorry, I'm swearing.
[25:56.55]That is very- that's odd.
[25:59.97]Why is that?
[26:01.13]Right?
[26:01.51]That's very strange.
[26:02.59]Okay, definitely want- I'll take the sand and water.
[26:26.47]Give me these.
[26:28.67]There we go.
[26:29.03]Duplicator.
[26:29.53]Hell yeah.
[26:30.61]Evolve that into the super lightning and we'll be good to go.
[26:45.54]Circular motions are really good with this because they spread around.
[26:47.90]Just give you like a little defense.
[26:49.50]Yeah, I think so.
[26:55.52]Good.
[26:57.35]Upgraded Santa Destroy.
[26:59.69]Into Water.
[27:00.25]Whatever.
[27:01.45]More heroes.
[27:05.07]Also, keep in mind I'm playing on the hard mode where the enemies have 50% more health.
[27:09.90]I gotta try to survive 30 minutes.
[27:16.62]I want that one.
[27:30.04]Alright.
[27:31.96]Definitely that one.
[27:34.38]Upgraded dusting.
[27:35.20]Looks much better.
[27:54.91]More dusting.
[28:06.10]Alright, this is not bad.
[28:14.10]Ooh, nice.
[28:15.91]Even more projectiles.
[28:19.09]Oh, that's okay.
[28:19.93]Okay, okay, that's okay.
[28:21.29]Very good.
[28:41.41]This is to do the Song of Mana, right?
[28:44.96]Is this part simulator?
[28:47.94]No, this is better.
[28:56.49]Bad.
[28:57.01]Sorry.
[29:03.37]Grimma does not read his chat.
[29:05.51]Every time you see me go like this, I'm looking at chat.
[29:08.00]Like here is like the top of the chat.
[29:10.48]Here is the bottom of chat.
[29:12.40]This is me looking at me.
[29:14.42]What's going on, dude?
[29:16.18]How you doing?
[29:17.38]I'm doing pretty good.
[29:20.26]Here I am.
[29:41.48]More.
[29:41.72]Passes through more enemies.
[29:43.42]Alright, this is looking like it's going to play out pretty well.
[29:46.89]I'm happy with this.
[29:51.19]More dusting.
[29:53.80]Dusting kind of sucks early, but it's really great later.
[29:55.88]Don't look.
[30:01.64]I just did.
[30:12.05]Ooh, alright, okay, okay, okay.
[30:16.93]I want the other gun, because now I'm going to shoot double.
[30:23.20]And now I need the tiramisu, and this thing can get upgraded again.
[30:41.60]I can't put my finger up, but Jerma looks weird tonight.
[30:43.34]Looks like he got facial reconstruction surgery.
[30:49.99]What the fuck, man?
[30:52.69]What the fuck?
[30:55.03]What the hell?
[30:56.11]Dude, what the fuck?
[31:02.27]That's so fucking weird.
[31:08.95]I see it.
[31:18.92]I don't know what it is.
[31:19.87]You guys are crazy.
[31:23.27]Come on, whip.
[31:47.30]I didn't say it was bad.
[31:48.51]Yeah, but that's kind of implied that I got a bunch of surgery on my face.
[32:05.68]You look like you're wearing somebody else's skin.
[32:23.89]spam here, this is awesome.
[32:28.16]I need a couple evolutions now, otherwise by 10 minutes this is going to be a disaster.
[32:34.90]It's the, okay, you know what it is?
[32:35.96]It's the fact that the light in the room is off, the ring light is on, and I haven't had a haircut.
[32:42.10]That's what's going on.
[33:12.36]I just thought about that guy that said... Oh, hey, dude, what's the baseball stream?
[33:19.01]I'm like a new viewer.
[33:21.85]And then Ballfondler replied and said, oh, dude, he's going to shove an entire baseball up his ass.
[33:26.71]And the more that I was thinking about this, and me and Holly were talking about this, we were laughing our asses off about this, because it's like...
[33:34.92]Why would I need four or five months of planning to do that?
[33:40.56]Like, oh, here it is, guys.
[33:42.30]The big baseball stream.
[33:44.79]And I shove a baseball up my ass.
[33:48.53]Oh, guys, get hyped.
[33:49.35]The baseball stream is in four months.
[33:53.79]Why would I need to do that?
[33:57.99]Huh?
[33:58.71]Huh?
[34:14.47]That's like, so funny, you have no idea.
[34:16.82]The more that I think about that, it's just like, what?
[34:22.20]Imagine me announcing that?
[34:25.32]Guys, get hyped for the baseball stream!
[34:27.24]Yo, baseball!
[34:28.21]Yeah, what's gonna happen is, I'm gonna be on camera, and I'm gonna shove a baseball up my ass.
[34:34.35]Pog!
[34:34.91]PogChamp, let's go!
[34:37.19]What?
[34:39.45]I'm like, hyping that up for months?
[34:47.14]There's so many layers to why I think that that is really funny.
[34:59.07]And I'm hyping it up for months and then I just get permanently banned in 10 seconds.
[35:05.31]What do you think is going to happen?
[35:09.09]Why would that ever be something that you'd get hyped about?
[35:15.69]It's insane.
[35:19.50]There's so many layers.
[35:20.30]I just can't... that's such an onion of a joke.
[35:23.20]Alright, I want the whip, yo.
[35:46.13]Look at how good the gun is.
[35:47.07]It's insane.
[35:47.67]It's so good.
[35:55.08]Craziest dream this has been, huh?
[35:57.89]This has been wild.
[36:01.21]There's been a few wild ones over the last week or two here.
[36:20.98]I want the chest in here.
[36:21.88]Because I want to know where it is, so when I get full levels, I want to be able to upgrade something.
[36:27.41]Okay, there we go.
[36:39.34]Shit, don't die.
[36:51.87]Alright, I gotta collect stuff otherwise it's gonna hit me.
[36:54.77]Alright, I need... ore.
[37:01.75]Alright, we're good.
[37:14.28]And I also think about this stuff too.
[37:17.30]Like, the guy that wrote that.
[37:21.11]Like, what are you up to right now?
[37:22.53]Like, what's your day look like today?
[37:25.67]Are you doing good?
[37:26.39]Like, you just hanging out?
[37:27.19]Like, what is the Ballfondler's, like, game today?
[37:30.13]You know what I mean?
[37:31.24]I'm kind of curious.
[37:32.10]Is this a cooldown game?
[37:39.32]Yeah, dude.
[37:39.64]Alright, come on.
[37:44.11]Come on.
[37:50.00]I hope the ball farm was like doing good, you know?
[38:15.22]Okay, hold on.
[38:29.81]Alright, level 8.
[38:32.57]Dust is now a heal.
[38:34.41]Very big deal.
[38:38.25]Almost have this maximum.
[38:39.53]Alright, that's one max.
[38:41.03]Do I have them both maxed out?
[38:42.23]I need a little bit more.
[38:43.59]Getting there.
[38:54.07]The dust is now healing a shitload, so it's really, really good.
[39:02.47]I need something to evolve right now We're very soon gonna get overwhelmed
[39:38.23]Alright, here's another chest.
[39:45.69]Oh, chest?
[39:46.47]Alright, go.
[39:50.57]Collect-a-thon.
[40:03.04]Lightning.
[40:05.82]More cooldown.
[40:07.54]I want that.
[40:08.12]I want sand and water.
[40:10.64]Okay, getting there.
[40:15.09]Seven.
[40:15.43]Done.
[40:15.99]I need one more and done.
[40:18.75]This thing goes crazy.
[40:33.18]Lightning ring.
[40:33.72]I have duplicator.
[40:39.80]Yeah, I do.
[40:43.30]We'll pull down.
[40:50.91]We're lightning.
[40:54.09]Almost there.
[40:55.97]Come on.
[40:56.45]I'm almost halfway there.
[41:03.43]way too dank.
[41:04.97]Actually, it is kind of loud.
[41:12.41]Thanks for letting me know.
[41:24.72]Just so many chests.
[41:27.48]Just give me a max thing already.
[41:28.92]Come on.
[41:36.68]And then we can just coast.
[41:46.75]I could open one of them, maybe.
[41:47.77]That might be not a bad idea.
[42:09.84]Oh, shit.
[42:11.22]Oh, shit.
[42:13.71]Alright.
[42:19.89]Oh!
[42:19.99]Okay.
[42:25.63]These bats are the worst.
[42:26.52]I need the chicken.
[42:37.66]Mmm!
[42:54.25]More chicken, get it.
[42:54.89]If I had a vacuum, this would be amazing.
[43:11.46]Level 8.
[43:11.74]There we go.
[43:13.10]Perfect.
[43:16.22]Hell yeah.
[43:20.51]Alright, now I need those chests.
[43:23.86]And watch this.
[43:33.44]Super gun.
[43:36.32]The Fear Raggy.
[43:38.76]Scales with revivals.
[43:41.22]Watch this.
[43:45.72]Yep.
[43:46.60]Now I have another room for another weapon too.
[43:53.47]Lightning Rod 8.
[43:54.19]Hell yeah.
[43:54.83]Let's go with Whip.
[44:02.95]Thunder.
[44:04.05]Thunder Loop.
[44:04.55]Evolve Lightning.
[44:05.21]Strikes twice.
[44:08.01]Now I'm more confident that I'll be fine.
[44:19.42]Area of attack?
[44:20.34]I think I want that.
[44:24.03]I need... what do I need for this?
[44:26.47]Yeah.
[44:28.14]Actually, no.
[44:28.94]Not yet.
[44:32.52]Not until I figure out what other weapon I want.
[44:40.29]Whip again.
[44:40.71]Whip again.
[44:57.09]There's another one there too.
[44:57.89]I'm going to save that other one as well.
[45:15.00]It's on because of the cooldown.
[45:16.32]It's on permanently.
[45:17.04]Kind of distracting.
[45:33.94]Maybe I should just get area and forget about another upgrade.
[45:36.82]Because area would be... this would just keep spreading out.
[45:50.13]Play Bloons?
[45:52.99]I think I did it.
[45:53.70]Didn't I do it before?
[45:54.30]Look at the whip.
[46:06.28]Okay, so now I need to get Santa water up.
[46:16.49]Bloons is fun.
[46:18.17]I would play it.
[46:27.22]I gotta think what else I want to do on Friday if we don't do the Elden Ring thing.
[46:29.84]Because I'm doing the sponsor thing.
[46:34.91]But I want to do something else too.
[46:37.69]I'll take a look.
[46:39.67]New Bloons for Inscription.
[46:44.37]Play the new Bloons game, man.
[46:47.00]Is that luck?
[46:53.64]It is.
[46:54.60]Okay, I need... Almost there.
[47:18.78]Maybe.
[47:21.45]I feel like I have too much of a pea brain to do the later parts of Inscription.
[47:27.81]It's probably just going to keep getting harder.
[47:31.55]I'm just picking one of these up.
[47:36.92]Paladins?
[47:47.01]I'm gonna wait and take that at the very end.
[47:48.87]It's gonna be insane.
[47:58.61]I'm killing things so fast all the coins are spreading out too much.
[48:01.32]10 more minutes and that's it.
[48:31.65]I'll just take this, whatever.
[48:37.92]Tiramisu +2.
[48:39.34]This thing scales with revivals, so now I have two.
[48:57.77]So much health on the ground.
[49:07.40]Okay, now let's get the chest.
[49:10.62]For one of them.
[49:14.92]So what do I want for another weapon?
[49:16.94]What do I have as upgrades?
[49:20.35]What does the book do?
[49:21.19]Does the book wand?
[49:23.99]Not everybody hates wand, right?
[49:34.47]Everybody hates wand.
[49:47.67]I have to embrace her.
[49:48.42]Oh, I didn't want to pick that up.
[49:52.40]Oh well.
[49:52.56]She's still alive after getting hit by this.
[50:01.22]Axe.
[50:03.17]Yeah, axe is probably a good idea.
[50:04.77]If I get the axe, I'll do axe and, um... Ooh, but wait.
[50:13.28]I kinda want this.
[50:20.36]Now I need the curse item, which I have.
[50:29.85]I'm probably gonna be untouchable, by the way.
[50:33.15]No one's gonna be able to get over here.
[50:42.04]Oh god, here we go.
[50:47.86]Just don't move.
[50:51.78]Play Five Nights at Freddy's 4.
[50:52.78]You know, I watched a comprehensive lore video on Five Nights at Freddy's the other day.
[51:01.73]I just did.
[51:04.25]You know, the comfiest thing for me at this point is to just be in bed with my iPad and watch just like 50 minute long comprehensive lore dissection videos on franchises that I don't care about at all.
[51:25.78]It's interesting to me.
[51:26.46]I don't know why.
[51:31.67]Alright, give me the, uh... Okay, well, whatever.
[51:34.85]I need the curse item.
[51:39.31]It's not the curse item.
[51:42.12]I could banish some.
[51:42.80]I'm going to banish some stuff now.
[51:43.74]Because I don't want to see it.
[51:58.67]You know what I think is probably interesting to me?
[52:01.76]Because I know that there's a ton of people that are really, really interested in this.
[52:07.20]And I almost get to sit there and be an observer.
[52:11.26]Saying, oh, hmm, I wonder what they're going to think about that.
[52:16.27]Will the community agree?
[52:21.53]Please explain Five Nights at Freddy's.
[52:23.43]Okay.
[52:26.33]William Afton was co-owner of Freddy Fazbear Pizza.
[52:30.51]Or a different company or something.
[52:32.50]And he and... Is this a spoiler?
[52:36.58]I need to prove that I've been watching.
[52:43.94]William Afton had a son, Michael Afton.
[52:47.26]uh who went on to do something else or something um it ended up being that uh William afton was pretty bad guy and ended up essentially he was a he was a spoiler for five minutes of freddy's by the way so he was a serial killer he killed people and he would uh he killed them for him at the very fast beer restaurant
[53:12.10]Eventually, people got sick and tired of it.
[53:14.28]Of him killing people.
[53:16.24]And somebody figured it out and killed him.
[53:20.86]And then they stuffed him into a rabbit suit.
[53:23.80]And he keeps coming back.
[53:26.44]And he got... He got killed like five times now or something.
[53:40.75]And then his daughter is the doll in the game that is called Sister Location.
[53:58.82]You dreamed this.
[54:00.38]I did not dream this.
[54:01.70]This is for real.
[54:03.30]This is what happened.
[54:04.04]Look at all these chests.
[54:16.30]And then Freddy Fazbear becomes Tony the Tiger in the new game.
[54:21.08]And he's good and helps you.
[54:22.60]He's like, oh, I'm gonna help you.
[54:24.74]And he talks about, like, nutritional food and stuff.
[54:26.79]He wants you to be, like, healthy.
[54:27.85]Uh, I need, where's the curse item?
[54:50.97]Who is Freddy Fazbear?
[54:54.75]Who is Freddy Fazbear?
[54:55.81]That's what I want to know.
[55:00.04]I don't know.
[55:01.30]Who is Freddy Fazbear?
[55:05.30]Tomar Ray.
[55:05.92]What's up, Tomar?
[55:06.74]Thanks, Ray.
[55:11.67]Welcome, Tomar.
[55:13.89]Late night Vampire Survivors.
[55:18.94]Thanks for the raid.
[55:20.82]I looked you directly in the eyes.
[55:21.98]Hey, thanks for the raid.
[55:23.48]Does that feel weird?
[55:24.14]Like when I look directly into the camera and point and address you.
[55:32.41]I need to banish something because this is not what I want.
[55:42.69]I always figured that... Okay, wait, pay attention.
[55:45.93]This thing's going to kill me.
[55:51.06]I always don't like looking directly in the camera because I feel like it freaks people out.
[55:54.88]I like looking just kind of barely off the camera, like looking this way.
[56:05.53]What's happening?
[56:08.37]I like dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk.
[56:09.53]They usually mean something bad.
[56:15.53]Alright, I got five minutes left and I win on the hard level.
[56:24.26]Die.
[56:24.70]Whoa, that claw's huge.
[56:28.00]Die!
[56:28.45]Why would I want to die?
[56:44.56]Still haven't seen it.
[56:45.06]I'm going to start banishing other stuff.
[56:50.76]Okay, this is where I'm going to see it.
[56:54.00]Banish.
[57:01.49]Well, I'm not going to get the upgrade, but I'll at least be able to get the... There's luck, I guess.
[57:08.27]Oh, well.
[57:10.01]I think this is a win, though.
[57:11.80]It'll be fine.
[57:17.68]This thing has a lot of health.
[57:23.09]There we go, finally.
[57:35.47]Wait, what?
[57:35.95]What does the title say?
[57:37.07]I'm doing a speed run?
[57:43.91]Money.
[57:44.11]To all the fellow EU watchers, good morning.
[57:52.25]Yeah, good morning.
[57:57.15]Title's horrible.
[57:58.59]What is the title?
[57:59.25]I didn't do it.
[58:00.15]What's the title?
[58:02.89]Winding down with some Vampire Survivors.
[58:04.69]Emotional revived.
[58:05.91]Not clickbait.
[58:06.57]Lost in the sauce.
[58:07.41]Gone.
[58:07.75]Busted.
[58:08.35]Who fucking did this?
[58:09.59]Why?
[58:10.19]How long has it been like this for?
[58:13.87]No hacks?
[58:15.17]Who did this?
[58:21.78]I'm deleting it.
[58:25.83]Have the mods just been adding stuff to the title?
[58:29.20]For like the last hour?
[58:33.78]Bring that up.
[58:35.90]No, that wasn't me.
[58:36.66]I didn't do that.
[58:37.40]That wasn't me.
[58:42.82]You know, I'm so absent-minded.
[58:45.46]The mods could probably just do that every stream and I would not know if you didn't tell me.
[58:56.08]I gotta try to get to level 100.
[58:56.98]Level 99 with the dog.
[59:03.62]I think I'm too far away, but I'll try.
[59:11.98]Gotta stand still.
[59:34.81]I get to 99 in 2-3 minutes, but it's just money.
[59:38.34]Whatever.
[59:38.74]That's cool, though.
[59:51.71]Money done.
[59:52.27]Mods riding.
[59:53.13]Okay.
[60:02.86]Come on, I need to get to level 99.
[60:05.25]I won't get there, but at least I'll win.
[60:31.61]Alright, this is where it's gonna happen if it's going to.
[60:33.27]Can I sneak up here?
[60:37.99]Okay, don't be stupid about it.
[60:54.10]Watching 160p for full effect.
[61:23.87]One minute.
[61:25.40]I got it.
[61:27.46]What do you unlock for doing this?
[61:39.98]Oh my god, this is going to get actually kind of scary.
[61:41.86]I'm going to keep moving.
[61:59.33]Don't let him collapse it.
[62:00.93]30 seconds.
[62:04.47]Alright, I'm good.
[62:18.94]I think I got it.
[62:27.48]Five, four, three, two, one.
[62:29.67]Good.
[62:32.85]Yeah!
[62:33.75]Cool.
[62:38.61]I'm... What's going on here?
[62:39.73]Why is it so slow?
[63:01.96]It spawns another one, right?
[63:03.46]Every minute or something?
[63:10.16]Why am I faster?
[63:10.90]I don't have any movement speed or any slowdown, do I?
[63:16.59]Not that I know of.
[63:23.43]The flower's doing that?
[63:34.17]Oh!
[63:34.87]Alright.
[63:37.75]Yeah, you can't win anyways.
[63:38.69]Yeah, you can't win.
[63:49.06]Oh.
[63:53.58]Oh, I got skip.
[63:55.20]Another skip.
[63:56.28]And that's it.
[63:57.36]6.2 million from the quad guns.
[64:03.48]Very cool.
[64:06.38]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[64:07.38]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[64:08.92]Friday, we'll do some fun stuff.
[64:10.73]There will be a sponsor segment on Friday.
[64:12.81]I gotta talk to Ludwig and see what the plan is.
[64:15.25]We might do it Friday.
[64:16.49]We might move it.
[64:17.17]I'm probably gonna say we need to have another few days.
[64:21.89]We'll do some fun stuff.
[64:22.67]We'll play much stuff.
[64:24.47]Friday afternoon, I'll update you.
[64:28.45]What's the title say now?
[64:33.77]What's the title say?
[64:36.49]Let me see what the title is before I leave.
[64:37.63]Did one of the mods get hacked?
[64:49.16]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[64:50.79]Thanks for watching.
[65:09.23]Thanks to the mods for helping do the Elden Ring stuff earlier.
[65:13.01]Thanks for you, obviously, for sticking around.
[65:17.21]Have a great night.
[65:17.85]That was fun.
[65:19.39]You know, I really, really like the bounce around streams.
[65:23.60]Where it's like, alright, we got this.
[65:24.84]This is like a two hour thing.
[65:26.80]This is like a couple hours.
[65:27.72]This is like two or three hours.
[65:28.84]I like this a lot.
[65:29.86]I like how to bounce it around.
[65:33.10]They don't all have to be like this, but I like doing this.
[65:37.46]It's a lot of variety.
[65:38.18]I like it.
[65:42.63]That horror game was really, really off-putting, really terrifying.
[65:44.89]It was cool.
[65:47.99]It was a crazy experience.
[65:54.03]Give me some more of those kind of games.
[65:55.99]Give me some more of those kind of short horror experiences.
[66:00.49]I've missed a lot over the years.
[66:02.11]It's been a long time.
[66:10.57]There's a solid half dozen or at least dozen or so of those two-ish hour, three-ish hour horror experiences.
[66:23.08]I'd like to play some more.
[66:24.48]They're interesting.
[66:26.92]I completely forgot about the Barf Drinker and juggles and all the other Elden Ring.
[66:30.28]That was so much fun.
[66:33.86]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[66:35.96]Keep an eye on the sus because I'll update what's going to happen.
[66:38.52]And keep an eye on the Discord too.
[66:47.79]I will converse with Ludwig.
[66:49.93]We will see what's going to happen.
[66:55.57]Your hair is fine, by the way.
[66:57.03]Don't let chat make you self-conscious.
[66:58.65]Oh, no, I'm fine.
[66:59.85]I'm fine.
[67:00.29]I know everyone's just fucking around.
[67:01.45]I am too.
[67:02.07]Don't worry.
[67:03.10]I'm good.
[67:15.58]I wonder what was going on with the internet.
[67:17.97]It's weird.
[67:21.79]I'd say once every two or three weeks, there'll be one night where I just randomly every hour will just start dropping frames for like a minute or two straight.
[67:31.32]It's completely rock solid the rest of the time though.
[67:38.55]I would imagine it probably has to do with the VPN.
[67:40.51]Because I stream with the VPN a lot of times.
[67:45.11]Are you going to do some more recruiting for the Elden Ring stuff?
[67:47.80]I want to.
[67:50.02]It's probably going to happen offline.
[67:54.64]Just because of how difficult it was to kind of manage the amount of people that were trying to join.
[68:00.70]So keep an eye on the Discord.
[68:01.90]I'll keep you guys updated.
[68:02.55]I'll let you know.
[68:14.45]I'll see you guys soon.
[68:15.75]Take care.
[68:16.25]See you Friday.
[68:17.45]Regardless of what we do.
[68:25.13]See you soon.
[68:56.69]you
[69:31.55]Thank you.
[70:03.43]Thank you.
