[ve:60.16.100]

[00:12.76]What's happening, everybody?
[00:16.00]Welcome back to another live stream, to the live broadcast.
[00:22.13]Currently have a new audio setup right now where I've got Bluetooth headphones in.
[00:29.93]Pretty cool.
[00:34.90]I'm kind of speech jamming myself a little.
[00:37.50]There's a seven or eight people in a call right now and more coming.
[00:44.56]You can't hear them, but I can.
[00:50.74]I do have the one of those pass through things where you can.
[00:55.34]You can hear the outside world.
[00:59.04]But it kind of just feels like I can hear the outside world.
[01:02.88]And I'm underwater.
[01:05.29]Yeah, Lethal Company.
[01:06.57]There's a lot of people playing tonight.
[01:08.19]We got, I think, 10 people in this lobby.
[01:12.11]And I don't know, there's possibilities later that we might, who knows?
[01:15.75]I don't know.
[01:16.07]There might be like a 20 person lobby at some point.
[01:18.61]I don't know.
[01:19.71]We're just adding a shitload of people until we can't.
[01:22.50]So it's gonna be fun.
[01:27.86]You're still a streamer?
[01:29.02]Yeah, I'm still streaming.
[01:34.52]I just... Hey!
[01:36.96]Oh, I forgot to write that thing about the retirement.
[01:40.84]I didn't forget.
[01:41.44]I didn't forget.
[01:41.86]I know I had to do it.
[01:44.78]It's just a priority list.
[01:45.70]Like The Sims queue of important things.
[01:49.35]It just kind of... It fell off after going to the bathroom.
[01:52.55]You know, I queued up go to the bathroom five times and it ended up over there somewhere behind that.
[02:01.65]Yeah, no, it's gonna be fun.
[02:10.51]Are you zonked?
[02:12.53]No, no, I just have two headphones in.
[02:16.15]And they're those headphones that... They fill up your entire ear canal.
[02:22.59]So... This is new.
[02:31.09]There's gonna be so many side-splitting laughs.
[02:36.46]We'll see.
[02:39.49]You're allowed to be zonked.
[02:41.63]I don't think I could do it with this game.
[02:43.31]Alright.
[02:51.45]Give me one sec.
[02:55.25]We'll get started in about two minutes?
[02:57.13]Five minutes?
[02:58.27]Just waiting for people.
[02:59.67]Chilling.
[03:01.03]See you in a minute.
[04:10.38]They're just trying to figure out how to add people to the game.
[04:12.50]Let's just check out this board, I guess.
[04:15.24]Yep.
[04:15.44]See what... Bunch of, we have to... Bunch of Steam shit.
[04:21.81]Yeah.
[04:22.95]Yeah, they're figuring out technology.
[04:24.61]You know how it is.
[04:28.47]I've been using computers for 40 years.
[04:30.11]And I still have no idea how to use a lot of things.
[04:36.17]A grown-ass man can't use Steam, I know.
[04:38.21]A grown-ass man doesn't even know how to use Steam, that's right.
[04:42.27]So what's the funny character I should be?
[04:43.71]Should I be a funnier character than this?
[04:46.65]You're already a minion.
[04:47.91]That's peak humor for your eyes.
[04:50.89]I've been on a starting student screen this whole time, didn't even see it.
[04:56.87]Might as well quit.
[05:02.07]Does it say your names anymore?
[05:04.71]Oh, there it is.
[05:05.23]I can only see white stuff.
[05:09.08]Ah, there he is.
[05:09.86]Good morning.
[05:11.16]There he is.
[05:11.72]There you go.
[05:12.74]I can hear it.
[05:13.98]You're echoing really bad.
[05:15.24]Yeah, you have like... I am?
[05:17.84]Yeah, your audio game is coming to your mic.
[05:21.04]Why is that happening?
[05:22.00]Because you're a freak.
[05:23.22]Hold on, is that better?
[05:25.26]Test. Test. Test. Test. Test. Test. Test.
[05:30.94]There are too many people in here.
[05:31.94]There's too many people. Cancel it.
[05:44.00]Oh Ster is in here.
[05:49.00]Show a little goddamn excitement Ster.
[05:53.88]We're about to play this with like 19 people.
[05:56.29]Yippee!
[05:57.85]Hey, I already did that today.
[05:59.23]It was not great.
[06:00.17]It was not fun at all.
[06:01.48]It was very overstimulating.
[06:03.26]Well, it's going to be even better.
[06:04.36]No, it was fun.
[06:05.10]I don't even want to lie.
[06:05.78]It was fun.
[06:06.24]It was just like my head is mush.
[06:08.93]Which is great because of this game.
[06:11.84]Doesn't need brain.
[06:13.96]Just scrap.
[06:15.64]This is the only game that I've played for the past three streams.
[06:18.08]Uhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh

[07:09.29]Poke, I don't know if this is going to help at all.
[07:12.35]I'm going to try to, you know, obviously... Because don't play any Pac-Man and we will be fine.
[07:17.22]Well, no, I also died in World of Warcraft as well.
[07:19.38]Wait, you were playing?
[07:21.70]I made a shadow priest um and I died to one of the defias uh brotherhood people that are inside that hut when there's like three of them and by the way I made a shadow priest which is the biggest mistake the shadow priest has two moves in wow classic so that was a mistake in the very beginning yeah you just wand all day yeah and then I so I died on that character yeah awesome
[07:45.73]Can we all make a pact and never speak of World of Warcraft again for ten more years?
[07:52.56]Remind me ten years World of Warcraft exists.

[07:59.08]Me.
[07:59.36]Hey, take a swing.
[08:01.20]Don't get too ahead of yourself, man.
[08:04.04]You're one to talk.
[08:05.62]Hey, alright.
[08:06.84]I got the first place on the punching bag.
[08:10.52]You missed it.

[08:12.86]Hey, one first.
[08:14.98]What's the highest you've ever had on that bag?
[08:18.60]I didn't get beaten by a child.
[08:20.09]Whatever is the highest.
[08:21.11]Whatever is the highest.
[08:21.99]That was me.
[08:22.53]You did not get the highest.
[08:24.07]I can get to at least 800 on that thing, by the way.
[08:26.05]You did not get the highest.
[08:26.97]I have the knuckles.
[08:30.81]You see me sprinting across the arcade and throwing a haymaker into that thing, it'll be 850.
[08:34.37]Guaranteed.
[08:34.83]Do you want to see what you look like?
[08:38.71]Yeah.
[08:39.77]I know I look fucking amazing when I do it.
[08:44.33]Alright, how many?
[08:45.07]Who did we have?
[08:46.67]1, 2, 3, 4, 5?
[08:46.77]How many people are even in here?
[08:48.41]Hey, look at Ster's ass.
[08:49.83]Everyone look at Ster's butt.

[09:00.47]You can do that?
[09:03.09]You can do that?
[09:06.63]Okay.
[09:07.41]Dude, that's pretty efficient.
[09:08.77]Unbelievable.
[09:09.88]You can get chased by a monster and just shoot it out the back.
[09:12.62]I think your mic's on, bud.
[09:17.30]Point at him.
[09:18.58]That's bad streamer etiquette, dude.
[09:20.40]Wow.
[09:20.74]Push talk.
[09:23.01]Wow.
[09:23.19]This is my worst social nightmare of all time.

[09:37.74]Oh that's Master Chef.
[09:39.42]Master Chef I think.

[09:41.74]Oh that's sick.
[09:43.10]Yeah.
[09:43.26]Master Chef.
[09:44.02]Doom guy with his dumpy hat.

[10:15.02]No, no, not with this many people.
[10:17.04]Come on.
[10:17.49]We're not going to find a way out of here at all.
[10:19.87]I'm so scared.
[10:21.47]What's going on?
[10:23.07]Everybody panic.
[10:23.85]I think if we all scream, it'll be fine.
[10:27.85]Who touched my ass?
[10:29.25]Did we get Etalyx the mod list?
[10:32.68]I did, yeah.
[10:33.32]I got them the mod list.
[10:34.24]Okay, okay.
[10:34.86]I'm just making sure.
[10:36.34]Yeah, did someone turn the light on?
[10:39.58]Right on it, dude.
[10:40.34]Wait, wait, wait.
[10:41.32]We got it.
[10:49.29]Alright, so where are we going to go?
[10:52.07]What are we going to even do with this very thing?
[10:53.51]I don't know.
[10:54.03]We've got to- Oh!
[10:54.79]I swear to God.
[10:55.65]Hey, let's go to a moon!
[10:58.15]Let's go to the moon!
[10:59.12]And let's loot it!
[11:01.08]Hey, what's up Walmart Jim Carrey?
[11:05.02]Jim Carrey's worth like 100 million.
[11:06.76]What is that?
[11:07.28]Is that like 1%?
[11:08.56]I'll take that.
[11:08.99]Dude, I'd be the Walmart Jim Carrey if I get a fraction of that.
[11:12.79]Oh, fuck yeah.
[11:13.77]That sounds awesome.
[11:19.76]In fact, the Walmart, Jim Carrey, is implying that I'm in every town and every city in America.
[11:25.67]Yeah.
[11:26.57]We need Etalyx.
[11:28.23]Compliment.
[11:28.63]Yeah, Etalyx is the only one missing, I think.
[11:31.15]Well, Connor, too, but I don't know if Connor is alive right now.
[11:34.28]He said he wasn't coming yet.
[11:36.24]Okay, I wasn't sure if he meant he was going to be here for two hours or come in two hours.
[11:40.24]That's your reading comprehension problem.
[11:44.45]Yeah, well, our modpack has light company.
[11:47.99]They can join later.
[11:49.23]Okay.
[11:50.13]Yeah, they can join in real time.
[11:51.94]it just means you can join mid game oh thank god um yeah I've invited Etalyx twice there might be an issue with the mods so hopefully we'll get it yeah they need to have it make sure he's launching through the mod launcher itself yeah yeah top right launch yeah
[12:10.17]He just started the stream.
[12:11.20]Okay, so I think we could probably... We could probably start and then he could join the big game.
[12:16.30]Yeah, we could do it in the big game.
[12:18.46]Actually, I think he can only join once we're in orbit.
[12:20.82]So if we start, he won't be able to join until we are finished with that mission.
[12:24.40]So however long that is.
[12:26.16]Alright, well, I got an idea.
[12:27.48]Let's start a mission, have six of us die in the first ten seconds, and then have two people actually play the game, and we come back, and then we can start playing for real.
[12:32.95]Fuck yeah, dude.
[12:34.13]So you mean just play the game?
[12:35.21]I thought that's what we were doing anyway.
[12:36.97]You guys want to play the game?
[12:38.47]Yeah.
[12:39.27]Yeah.
[12:39.71]Let's go.
[12:40.33]Let's do it.
[12:42.13]Chad, I'll explain to you what's going on in a minute.
[12:44.42]I know you need a lot of explanation.
[12:45.92]What we're doing is we're gaming.
[12:47.52]Where's Poke?
[12:49.10]There's no Mr. Ding.
[12:49.94]Yeah.
[12:52.12]Where's Poke?
[12:52.64]What'd you say to me?
[12:53.50]Ooh.
[12:54.42]Ooh.
[12:55.53]Hey, do you have a Doug Sona?
[12:57.57]Hey!
[12:58.07]Hey guys!
[12:58.94]Where are you?
[13:00.06]Was that loud?
[13:01.06]Sorry.
[13:01.56]No, I just want to know where you are.
[13:02.84]Because you're the one I trust the most in here.
[13:04.78]He's right here.
[13:05.98]You gotta get used to those ones out there.
[13:08.18]Hey, I know the way.
[13:09.48]Who is this?
[13:10.32]Oh, remember that.
[13:11.17]I'm finally here.
[13:12.55]Where are we going?
[13:13.01]We're going to Vow?
[13:14.23]Vow.
[13:14.89]Kept you waiting, huh?
[13:15.75]Alright, alright.
[13:17.03]Kept you waiting.
[13:18.07]Start off at like a six.
[13:19.81]Six out of ten.
[13:21.71]So I guess we can we can break up into groups of two or three, right?
[13:25.10]Because we have nine people.
[13:26.50]Yeah, surely.
[13:27.66]Surely.
[13:28.76]And we split into little little groups.
[13:30.47]We get one, you know, two people walkie talkies.
[13:32.17]Yep.
[13:32.47]And then the guy in the chair.
[13:34.80]Well, we don't have any money, do we?
[13:36.38]I have an idea.
[13:36.74]I have an idea.
[13:37.50]What about this?
[13:38.20]Two groups, and then we have, like, our pile, and then your pile, and whoever brings the more loot, better group wins.
[13:45.07]Gets to kill the other group.
[13:46.35]Okay.
[13:47.05]Okay, or wins.
[13:48.41]Yeah, wins, wins.
[13:49.35]Yep, that's what I said.
[13:50.01]Alright, can somebody fucking power this thing?
[13:53.21]How do we do this?
[13:53.87]I don't know anymore.
[13:55.55]Whoever's the leader has to... Alright, so where are we going?
[13:59.65]Whoever's leading us.
[14:01.27]Alright, we got experimentation.
[14:04.19]It's rainy.
[14:04.71]We have assurance.
[14:05.39]It's flooded.
[14:06.19]We have vow.
[14:06.83]We have offense.
[14:07.67]It's eclipsed.
[14:08.51]It's flooded?
[14:09.75]Don't do flooded.
[14:10.79]Flooded bad.
[14:11.85]We have March.
[14:12.69]We have Rend, which is Eclipsed.
[14:15.13]Apparently you can see my butt.
[14:16.79]We have Dine.
[14:17.41]We have Heist.
[14:18.35]Your ass is hanging out.
[14:19.87]Is that a problem with those chaps?
[14:21.59]No, no, no.
[14:23.02]Alright, we going to March?
[14:26.62]Yeah.
[14:27.58]Is everybody over with March?
[14:29.32]What's the conditions?
[14:31.22]There's no condition on March.
[14:33.63]Perfect.
[14:35.15]Sounds great.
[14:37.66]We're already dead.
[14:38.74]There's zero.
[14:40.86]Let's go home.
[14:44.24]We've been dead from the start.
[14:45.71]This is a dead.
[14:46.35]This game is over.
[14:47.71]This is.
[14:48.89]Are you the host?
[14:49.57]Are you using your previous save?
[14:52.35]Oh, Vinny, are you the host?
[14:54.85]I'm the host, yeah.
[14:55.71]Do I have to do it?
[14:56.57]Are you using a previous save?
[14:58.59]No, I don't think so.
[15:00.46]It's okay.
[15:01.36]Let's just land and then take off again and I'll die.
[15:04.68]Yeah, that sounds good.
[15:05.58]Let's just go.
[15:06.76]That's kind of the point of the game anyway.
[15:09.50]We just go and die, so it works out.
[15:14.81]Alright.
[15:15.05]Why can't we land?
[15:19.95]I think that was the flashlight from last time.
[15:21.97]So, I mean, we died, but we had a flashlight, maybe?
[15:24.27]Whoever started the lobby has to land us.
[15:26.25]I think you... I have to land us?
[15:27.81]Alright.
[15:28.17]Hey, I think it's Winnie.
[15:30.12]Okay, sorry.
[15:30.80]I'm bad at this.
[15:32.06]Alright.
[15:33.32]I'm trying to open the door.
[15:37.40]Jump down, jump down, jump down.
[15:38.56]Okay, okay, okay.
[15:39.17]Go, go, go.
[15:39.75]No, no, no.
[15:40.49]Don't.
[15:41.43]What are they doing?
[15:43.67]I didn't make it.
[15:46.59]Hey, am I the only person that waits till the ride stops, keeps their arms and legs in the vehicle at all times, and then gets out when the instruction person says, you can put your hands up now?
[15:55.41]I'm not talking to anybody, by the way.
[15:57.16]Who are you talking to?
[15:58.12]Hey, what's up?
[15:58.90]How's it going, guys?
[16:00.14]Everybody left when I was talking.
[16:01.54]Hey, I think we can leave now.
[16:04.76]Nice job.
[16:05.22]Wait, you survived?
[16:05.92]Do we have to do it again?
[16:08.27]I did a backflip and landed on my feet.
[16:10.39]You know.
[16:12.23]You know how it is.
[16:14.25]Alright.
[16:14.75]Alright.
[16:15.01]So good round, everyone.
[16:16.41]Everybody now lives.
[16:17.63]Are we good?
[16:18.03]Yeah.
[16:19.49]Well, no.
[16:21.25]Well, no, we're dead, but no.
[16:22.63]Yeah, no.
[16:23.27]No, he's pissed.
[16:23.99]I don't understand what's happening.
[16:26.64]We didn't get anything.
[16:28.34]But he used the previous save and we didn't have any money.
[16:31.36]So basically we're resetting the game.
[16:35.16]Hey, I'm back.
[16:36.54]So everyone, did we die?
[16:39.06]How come we did not jump off the spaceship?
[16:41.59]I did.
[16:44.44]could have been cool when you hear when you hear a comms you just listen you don't listen dance until I'm dead so it still says zero days and we're not dead yet well my land ship again or
[17:00.12]I don't know.
[17:01.46]Maybe you have to... Maybe because you guys... Did you play previously with mods or no?
[17:06.48]No mods previously, no.
[17:07.82]Maybe it's because you're playing on a previous take that was unmodded.
[17:11.05]It's freaking out the game.
[17:11.87]You might have to restart the modding.
[17:13.51]Rehost it and... Yeah, rehost it.
[17:16.97]Alright.
[17:17.37]Let's go, go, go, go, go.
[17:19.23]Jump off.
[17:19.79]Everybody jump off.
[17:21.01]Jump off.
[17:23.85]I made it.
[17:24.35]And I live again.
[17:24.99]How did you live?
[17:26.91]Great work.
[17:27.61]Ain't nothing to it.
[17:32.20]Alright, we'll get it figured out.
[17:34.60]Just a normal day of living again.
[17:36.36]Do we do a new lobby?
[17:39.22]Do everything?
[17:40.12]Oh my god.
[17:40.66]Yeah, I think so.
[17:41.32]We're missing one person.
[17:42.48]Yeah, we might have to go to a different planet.
[17:44.20]Don't worry, guys.
[17:45.04]I'll send us back.
[17:51.13]You get to keep all the money.
[17:52.11]That's... Poor shit.
[17:53.27]Oh shit, okay.
[17:59.07]It's computers, it's modern, you know there's always going to be issues.
[18:01.78]Yeah, guys.
[18:03.16]I hear you guys.
[18:04.50]It won't let me invite Etalyx, I don't know why.
[18:10.79]Yeah, I think just restart with a new lobby.
[18:13.75]Okay, sorry guys.
[18:14.61]There's only so many command on the planet for it to count.
[18:18.61]Alright.
[18:19.33]Wait, land on a planet for it to count?
[18:20.59]No, this is the intro music.
[18:22.17]It's doing the intro stuff on the speaker.
[18:24.09]Oh, you're right.
[18:25.24]It's definitely glitched out.
[18:26.52]It's definitely glitched out.
[18:27.34]Alright, I'll be back then.
[18:28.64]Alright, alright.
[18:30.24]Hey, stream hasn't even started yet.
[18:32.28]We're just still starting soon screen.
[18:35.94]Yeah, starting soon screen.
[18:36.78]That's all good.
[18:38.01]Hey, you know, we have like six mods installed.
[18:40.33]You knew it was going to... Yeah, it's going to happen.
[18:42.43]Alright, we'll figure it out.
[18:43.23]We haven't even started the stream yet.
[18:49.07]Well, I do have a second, so let's talk about this.
[18:53.38]Grotto Beasts is officially on sale as of right now.
[19:02.76]Grotto Beasts, all the cards and the kit are between 15% and 20% off.
[19:09.45]I think 15% to 18% if you do the actual full math.
[19:15.93]Yeah, it's going to be live there until...
[19:19.76]the store comes down.
[19:21.53]So there's still a little bit of inventory left.
[19:23.23]We figured put it on sale.
[19:24.89]If anybody wants it, grab it.
[19:27.51]This is your last opportunity to do so until the end of the year.
[19:32.27]The Tabletop Simulator mod is also launching today.
[19:40.18]So it will be once it's live and ready.
[19:45.05]I'm going to make sure the mods will be able to ping everybody in the Grotto Beasts announcement Discord channel as well as here too.
[19:52.73]It is a free tabletop simulator mod.
[19:54.38]It's going to have lots of support.
[19:56.36]It's already beautiful.
[19:57.34]It's already wonderful.
[19:58.16]It's already very well made.
[20:00.34]But definitely check it out.
[20:05.91]I think I just got invited.
[20:06.67]I'm really happy to be here, that's all.
[20:11.25]How are we doing?
[20:12.30]I feel like I'm... You just seem very happy to be a part of the lobby, that's all.
[20:19.86]You have a smiley face, you're very happy.
[20:21.66]What is a smiley face?
[20:22.82]No, I like being happy.
[20:25.70]Should we confirm that it... Is the problem solved?
[20:29.12]Some predators consider a smile to be a threat.
[20:31.66]I'm always given a threat.
[20:36.12]Okay, what the flip?
[20:37.98]Who did this?
[20:39.64]Guys, roll up.
[20:41.40]I wonder if eight people is going to be too many or enough for shenanigans.
[20:43.99]I think it's going to be a little too many, but it'll be fun too many.
[20:46.77]And we can split into groups.
[20:47.83]I think it's going to be good.
[20:49.05]It's fine.
[20:49.75]It's fine.
[20:50.49]We just need to get started.
[20:53.65]We are good.
[20:54.21]We are good.
[20:54.85]We just need to go.
[20:55.83]We're still missing.
[20:57.15]Who are we missing?
[20:57.97]Alex again?
[21:00.35]I think so.
[21:01.37]He said he doesn't even want to play.
[21:05.32]Access terminal.
[21:07.42]How do I do the terminal again?
[21:09.30]Help.
[21:10.80]I think Alex said he was ready for another invite.
[21:14.11]He said he had to restart.
[21:15.31]We're on a moon already.
[21:16.21]I think we can just... You want to just go?
[21:18.29]Okay, we'll go to the moon.
[21:18.93]Can we just do that?
[21:19.51]Let's go to the moon.
[21:20.13]Let's do it.
[21:21.53]Doing it.
[21:22.51]Yeah, we have...
[21:27.71]Let's go in let's go in who my fire escaping with oh
[21:48.13]I'm just gonna try to live.
[21:49.37]I don't give a shit about any of you guys.
[21:51.43]I'm following somebody.
[21:53.36]I'm following quite a few of you actually.
[21:54.58]Oh, Ster.
[22:11.24]Ster, isn't it so crazy that you and I ended up together?
[22:13.96]This is so crazy.
[22:15.90]Why do you only play bad video games?
[22:17.59]Why is the most that we've talked in the last several years because of Diablo 4 and now you're playing WoW?
[22:23.81]I can't take you seriously with your eyes like that.
[22:33.86]Hey, it's just me and you, man.
[22:37.76]Oh, we gotta get the loot.
[22:39.54]Well, crikey, what's up, dude?
[22:40.38]Alright, where we going?
[22:41.22]People over there?
[23:03.39]I feel like we're in a competition.
[23:05.92]Yeah, we are.
[23:07.62]I don't like it being a competition.
[23:09.78]I didn't collect any loot on the scoreboard.
[23:11.80]Aren't you going to get laughed at?
[23:13.46]That's right.
[23:14.38]I don't care.
[23:14.92]I don't care about the Ster and Jerma routine.
[23:17.36]I'm getting an item so I don't get laughed out of the fucking room.
[23:21.11]There's nothing here.
[23:32.68]Okay.
[23:33.18]This moon sucks!
[23:34.10]There's nothing here!
[23:35.36]Oh, dead end.
[23:39.84]Okay.
[23:42.54]Okay.
[23:43.41]Okay.
[23:44.63]Guy?
[23:45.41]You got me!
[23:46.01]There's no turret!
[23:47.19]It didn't work.
[23:47.71]It didn't work.
[23:48.15]I found a liquid mine, you see?
[23:49.01]Okay.
[23:49.25]I gotta get- I gotta be alone for this.
[23:50.91]You know when you go to a haunted house?
[23:59.46]Oh yeah, he's right there in the corner.
[24:21.65]Oh shit.
[24:23.36]He's stupid.
[24:24.38]He said that we're... Alright.
[24:26.26]Get him.
[24:43.58]I was going to say this.
[24:45.98]Okay, now that it's... They'll take care of it.
[24:49.04]This is like when you go to a haunted house and there's like 30 people in front of you and 30 people behind you.
[24:55.56]And a guy, like 10 people in front of you got scared.
[24:59.62]So it's like, oh shit, like 25 steps up that way, something wild is going to happen.
[25:06.55]Oh, hey, let's go.
[25:08.35]It's right over here somewhere.
[25:09.83]It's down there.
[25:11.51]There's nothing even in this!
[25:12.71]There's no fucking items!
[25:13.45]Woah, you did it!
[25:42.67]What?
[25:43.23]Get it, get it.
[25:45.96]Nice.
[25:47.02]What?
[25:47.24]Oh, it's on his head.
[25:48.74]Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[25:51.98]Nice.
[25:52.12]Okay.
[25:52.28]Oh, that's alright.
[25:53.12]It's okay.
[25:54.28]Ross, how does it feel to be a killer, dude?
[26:11.78]Oh, did you?
[26:12.34]Did you?
[26:13.86]The imposter.
[26:15.61]Everyone sounds the fucking same.
[26:17.01]My name is fucking sure SM7B, bro.
[26:18.95]What the fuck is going on here?
[26:21.11]I bought this four years ago.
[26:22.75]I'm sorry.
[26:24.37]Wait, hold on.
[26:24.95]Does this make it a little easier that you can decipher who's talking and who isn't?
[26:28.23]I'll do this for the rest.
[26:31.13]I'll do this for the next at least 25 minutes to make sure we can communicate effectively.
[26:36.73]Who brought Grandpa in the lobby, dude?
[26:38.29]What the hell is happening?
[26:41.30]Who's body do I have?
[26:42.42]That was really funny.
[26:45.08]Who's body do I have?
[26:49.15]I gotta sound distinct.
[27:10.28]Who's body do I have?
[27:13.92]I think it's Rambo.
[27:16.25]Yeah, Ross beat the shit out of him.
[27:18.23]To be fair, he had a head cramp.
[27:24.53]Well, now it's not going to turn back on.
[27:27.55]Alright, should we... Should we turn in the things?
[27:34.65]We only have two stop signs.
[27:36.29]Let's get out of here.
[27:39.45]How do we get out of here?
[27:40.54]I don't know.
[27:41.30]Dude, I'm scared.
[27:43.06]Oh, I thought that was a scary ice cream truck.
[27:46.76]It's the... Okay, we're good.
[27:48.90]Wait, what's this?
[27:49.60]Can we flip a... Nope.
[27:56.39]Oh, there we go.
[27:57.23]Now we're back on.
[27:58.41]There we go.
[27:58.85]I think that affects it this way.
[28:04.20]I want to make sure we have money.
[28:06.12]We don't lose money.
[28:07.58]What?
[28:08.18]I'm sorry.
[28:09.35]I'm a very confusing partner.
[28:10.81]I apologize already.
[28:11.87]No, it's okay.
[28:13.15]Oh, okay.
[28:13.91]You need to back away.
[28:14.95]Back away.
[28:15.37]Back away.
[28:16.59]Okay.
[28:17.01]Okay.
[28:17.43]Okay.
[28:17.89]Okay.
[28:18.37]Okay.
[28:18.79]Okay.
[28:19.27]Okay.
[28:19.69]Okay.
[28:20.17]Okay.
[28:23.07]Dermot, are you alive?
[28:24.85]I'm alive, but I don't know where I am.
[28:27.77]Where?
[28:28.05]Did you go down the stairs?
[28:31.09]I did not go.
[28:32.07]I did not go down the stairs.
[28:34.14]Are you still in the hallway?
[28:36.03]I'm in the... Yeah, I'm above you.
[28:40.03]Hold on.
[28:42.79]Oh my god, what the fuck is that?
[28:44.23]Did you hear that door?
[28:45.57]Yep.
[28:46.95]Okay, so you're closed.
[28:48.41]I... Okay, I see you.
[28:49.79]I'm up the stairs.
[28:50.31]I'm up the stairs.
[28:50.96]Oh, thank god.
[28:51.94]Let's keep that closed, because that guy's going to kill us in some way.
[28:56.44]Alright, so how do we get out of here?
[28:58.46]Wait, how do we keep... Wait, did you open that door?
[29:01.15]I did not touch anything.
[29:03.29]Is that bad?
[29:04.53]He's downstairs.
[29:05.37]He's downstairs.
[29:05.85]He's downstairs.
[29:06.87]Okay.
[29:07.41]Okay.
[29:09.05]Okay.
[29:09.79]My heart is beating.
[29:11.85]Yeah, mine too.
[29:13.36]Dude, we're trapped in here.
[29:15.34]I've got some bad news.
[29:17.14]Yeah?
[29:18.98]Yeah, he's... I'll go look.
[29:23.50]Remember me.
[29:27.07]Okay.
[29:28.21]He's gone.
[29:28.55]He's gone.
[29:29.11]This way.
[29:29.43]Okay, good.
[29:30.99]Wait, I'm confused.
[29:32.23]Why do we keep circling around into the same room?
[29:34.94]I don't know.
[29:36.34]Dude, I am the absolute bottom 0.0% spatial awareness and directions.
[29:43.92]So, I have absolutely no idea.
[29:45.96]I think we have to... Jesus!
[29:51.05]I think we have to go that way.
[29:51.79]Jesus Christ.
[29:53.31]Yeah, he's blocking the way.
[29:57.47]Well, we're going to lose money if we don't get the body back, so let me just peek.
[30:00.68]I'll use this railing as the in-between so he doesn't... Oh, he's not there.
[30:07.32]Okay, we need to bait him out so that we can run past.
[30:12.62]What was that?
[30:13.60]I don't know.
[30:16.16]Okay, well, we've got to go through there, even if he's in there.
[30:21.23]I think we just have to go.
[30:22.27]Okay.
[30:24.25]Me first.
[30:24.79]I'll do it.
[30:25.51]Oh, no.
[30:26.13]He's right there.
[30:26.77]He's literally right there.
[30:28.49]He's literally at the door.
[30:30.99]What are we supposed to do?
[30:32.69]He's just in the way.
[30:33.63]I'm thinking.
[30:39.66]Can we sideswipe him?
[30:42.46]Okay.
[30:42.68]Well, here's... Okay.
[30:45.44]If you can get one body back to the ship...
[30:48.49]we'll get less of a fine.
[30:50.19]If all three of us die, we're fucked.
[30:53.43]So no, you should carry the body.
[30:55.37]I think you should carry the body because even when we get outside, I won't know where to go.
[30:58.93]Okay.
[31:00.03]Okay.
[31:00.37]Okay.
[31:00.95]So I'll... Let me... Don't see him.
[31:02.39]Okay.
[31:03.11]You ready?
[31:03.59]Let me go first.
[31:05.65]He's right there.
[31:06.09]He's right here.
[31:06.55]He's right here.
[31:07.27]He's right here.
[31:08.79]Okay.
[31:08.97]He... I don't... Is he on me?
[31:11.04]He might be.
[31:13.18]This way.
[31:14.10]Maybe?
[31:14.32]No?
[31:14.88]No.
[31:15.10]I don't know.
[31:17.12]Maybe this way?
[31:19.56]This is a dead end, isn't it?
[31:21.46]Yes, this is a dead end.
[31:22.88]Shit.
[31:25.52]We gotta take a left.
[31:27.10]Take another left.
[31:28.72]It's a dead end.
[31:29.76]That's a dead end.
[31:30.42]Are you serious?
[31:31.62]I don't know.
[31:33.31]What about over here?
[31:33.83]Isn't that where we came from?
[31:36.99]I'm just jumping.
[31:37.53]It's to the right.
[31:37.93]No, don't do it.
[31:38.37]Jesus fucking Christ!
[31:39.01]Oh my god.
[31:55.55]What?
[31:55.79]Wait!
[31:56.27]Woah! Woah! Woah! Woah! What happened?
[32:02.27]Oh, they left.
[32:04.27]Yeah we had no idea where the hell we we're going.
[32:07.27]I'm sorry Jerma we had to leave. It was getting rough out there.
[32:12.27]No I- we had no idea where the hell we we're going.
[32:26.30]So this is MMO?
[32:27.20]I'm ready.
[32:27.50]I'm ready.
[32:29.38]We're gonna get Etalyx in here and then we... Jerma, put a costume on.
[32:34.31]Thank you.
[32:35.35]I am so sorry.
[32:36.15]You look ridiculous.
[32:37.11]Put something on.
[32:37.97]I'm in the minion costume.
[32:39.31]What?
[32:40.01]No, you weren't.
[32:40.99]You look ridiculous.
[32:42.45]I was in the minion... What?
[32:43.90]No, I was not.
[32:44.80]How dare you.
[32:46.28]Default Daniel.
[32:47.28]You were Default Daniel.
[32:48.22]We all saw you.
[32:49.38]We all saw it.
[32:50.86]Default Daniel.
[32:51.68]John Default.
[32:55.40]Val?
[32:56.42]Val?
[32:56.96]We weren't just at Val, right?
[32:57.90]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[32:58.74]Well, let's go to a Tootsie Planet.
[33:00.32]I keep thinking of Pogues Comet.
[33:02.08]It's the funniest fucking thing I've ever heard.
[33:05.34]It's my fault, really.
[33:07.96]Oh, Etalyx.
[33:08.58]You're here.
[33:08.90]Hey, go get it.
[33:09.90]You made it.
[33:10.24]Go get it.
[33:11.76]I did.
[33:12.20]Thank you for your patience.
[33:13.36]Hey, there he is.
[33:14.78]Sorry, we couldn't get you in here sooner.
[33:16.14]There's three of them.
[33:17.68]There's three of them.
[33:18.72]I was trying to figure out the mod launcher.
[33:20.78]Everybody in the ship, quiet right now.
[33:22.86]Criken is going to tell us some strategy.
[33:37.70]Oh my god.
[33:38.14]Alright, thank you very much, uh, Jerry.
[33:40.45]Alright, everyone, we're going to march.
[33:41.97]This is a foggy and wet place.
[33:44.87]Alright, in the middle, as soon as you walk a- Who did that?
[33:48.79]My bad.
[33:50.69]I have a cold, sorry.
[33:52.36]Okay.
[33:54.82]Your excuse.
[33:56.19]Anyway, we're going to this foggy place.
[33:57.93]There's a big pit in the middle with a lake.
[34:00.47]If you walk into that, you're gonna drown.
[34:02.21]Okay?
[34:02.47]So you're not gonna be able to see very well.
[34:03.71]You have one flashlight.
[34:05.03]That's Vinny.
[34:05.51]Vinny is the go-to illuminator.
[34:07.92]We're all gonna go right behind him.
[34:09.02]He's gonna walk into the facility.
[34:09.96]We're all gonna follow him.
[34:11.00]I got this.
[34:11.44]Okay?
[34:12.34]Then we're gonna get as much crap as we can.
[34:13.42]What if I wanna swim?
[34:15.04]Easy peasy.
[34:16.08]I'm good?
[34:17.32]Got it.
[34:17.62]That sounds so cool.
[34:18.46]Alright.
[34:19.12]Let's go.
[34:19.30]I'm ready to fight.
[34:20.48]I'm ready to fight.
[34:21.60]I mean, to survive.

[34:27.94]Wait, that's the person with the light!
[34:44.53]Oh.

[40:11.97]We got to make some money.
[40:14.61]I hear a loud noise.
[40:18.78]Oh, we should be scared.
[40:19.86]We should be scared.
[40:20.76]We should be scared.
[40:21.44]We should be very scared.
[40:24.28]I'm not scared by that thing.
[40:26.44]Come on, new creature.
[40:28.20]I wonder what it is.
[40:30.32]Wait, did you?
[40:33.05]What?
[40:33.43]Okay, you're good.
[40:35.03]You're good.
[40:35.41]Just make sure everybody's good.
[40:36.47]This is bad.
[40:37.41]Oh, this is very bad.
[40:42.83]Come on.
[40:43.23]I gotta get my camera on whatever's happening.
[40:45.31]The thing that's happening that's funny.
[40:46.83]Where is it?
[40:47.19]I gotta get my camera on it.
[40:49.49]It's the spider web here.
[40:54.69]I want the dice.
[40:55.93]You can't have them.
[40:56.81]No, you can't.
[40:57.53]I 100% have to take them.
[40:58.47]You can't have them.
[40:59.17]No, don't take them.
[41:00.41]I'm going to take them.
[41:01.21]I'm going to take them.
[41:02.99]Where?
[41:03.21]I'm going to trade him poke.
[41:04.90]Where are they?
[41:05.52]Okay, trade him poke.
[41:06.76]The imposter vented.
[41:07.62]The imposter vented.
[41:12.51]Where is everybody?
[41:15.43]I don't know.
[41:15.82]I don't know where the fuck... I don't know how to leave.
[41:22.44]How can we hear them so clearly through here?
[41:24.44]I don't know.
[41:25.98]I don't know.
[41:27.06]It's a great question, really.
[41:28.08]We need a flashlight.
[41:34.57]Fucking Homer Simpson just died.
[41:37.19]Guys, I'm in trouble.
[41:43.31]I think it's this way.
[41:45.43]I think it's this way.
[41:46.18]Are you alright?
[41:52.76]What's this ooze?
[41:55.50]Oh my god!
[42:00.74]He's got a weapon!
[42:04.70]Alright, I'm gonna... Hello?
[42:12.76]oh oh god damn it oh god damn it oh god
[42:26.42]I... I don't know where the fuck I'm going!
[42:29.34]I don't know where I'm going!
[42:30.74]Is what this has revealed to me.
[42:32.14]I missed it!
[42:32.98]Yeah.
[42:33.38]Why is Vinny just in the void?
[42:35.68]He's in the fog.
[42:36.62]It's dark and foggy.
[42:37.38]Alex fell into the water.
[42:38.48]I think he must have joined late and walked into the ocean.
[42:42.17]I died from the ooze?
[42:43.25]How?
[42:44.13]Yeah, you ran into the ooze.
[42:45.31]Yeah, you ran right into it.
[42:47.43]I never seen that monster before.
[42:49.53]Classic.
[42:50.37]You jumped over it the first time.
[42:52.49]Yeah, you did it right.
[43:00.31]How'd it go guys?
[43:02.05]Do we all have fun in there?
[43:03.01]Did we actually, do we make any money?
[43:06.41]We got two things.
[43:08.68]We've made some money.
[43:10.38]That was exactly how I expected the first round, my first round to go.
[43:14.14]Okay, not to overcomplicate things even more.
[43:17.14]Ster better hit that door, dude.
[43:20.89]There's something else left.
[43:22.89]Yeah, I think there's a dog.
[43:25.05]We might combine groups with Mugwig.
[43:27.29]Vinny's going the wrong way.
[43:28.83]Oh, he's home.
[43:30.39]We should try our hardest to get the teleporter.
[43:33.17]Yeah, I agree.
[43:34.41]Teleporter's going to save our ass.
[43:35.93]Teleporter's going to save us so much money because of all the bodies that get killed.
[43:39.72]Teleporter's huge.
[43:41.20]It's going to be a total disaster.
[43:42.52]Do you have anything?
[43:43.10]Yeah, I got something.
[43:47.96]Big bull.
[43:48.92]One bull.
[43:49.78]We should go to a... Yeah, I got killed by the pit.
[43:55.58]There's no movement.
[43:56.12]You killed the pit?
[43:57.74]No, I got... There was a monster that came out of the pit and then it ate me.
[44:02.43]The interns from the VIPs, huh?
[44:06.43]Yeah.
[44:06.63]Well, to be fair... What was that?
[44:08.23]Oh, we went for a treat.
[44:08.83]Etalyx downloaded the game 30 minutes ago.
[44:11.89]God, that was a nightmare.
[44:15.84]I had like a bunker spider and another bug.
[44:18.28]Rambu fell off and died.
[44:20.10]Kryken ran away and died.
[44:22.02]It was awful.
[44:22.78]And then I had to find you in the fog.
[44:24.96]I'm alive!
[44:26.98]Good morning, everyone.
[44:28.32]Good morning.
[44:29.66]Good morning.
[44:30.70]How was everyone's day at work?
[44:32.81]Only one day left.
[44:34.71]Anybody else get their face ripped off by a bug?
[44:37.11]Just me?
[44:37.41]Yeah, me too.
[44:38.11]Me too.
[44:38.47]I got hugged and it was like... I'm glad we at least got stuff.
[44:40.83]Yeah, he was a little aggressive.
[44:42.32]I'm not gonna lie.
[44:43.50]I broke his ankles.
[44:45.12]You weren't killed by that bug.
[44:46.92]What?
[44:47.48]Oh, what?
[44:48.00]You were killed by a spider while that bug was on your face.
[44:52.10]Oh, that's classic.
[44:52.80]Don't worry.
[44:53.38]You didn't get killed by a bug.
[44:54.80]I knew I felt a little something.
[44:55.92]You got killed by something bug-adjacent.
[44:58.14]Yes.
[44:58.90]You ready?
[44:59.22]How silly of me.
[45:00.26]I didn't detect you.
[45:01.18]I'm still crawling up my body.
[45:02.98]We have to be careful because we lost a lot of people and those bodies cost money.
[45:09.14]It only takes money... I don't cost anything.
[45:10.84]I'm priceless.
[45:11.19]It only takes money out of your account and we were basically broke right now so it doesn't really matter.
[45:15.31]Oh yeah.
[45:15.53]You gotta spend bodies to make bodies.
[45:19.37]I volunteer.
[45:23.88]Should we have the squad go to the fire exit and then the other exit to the front door?
[45:27.68]I'm down to do fire escape.
[45:28.52]I can do fire escape.
[45:29.30]This way, Foz.
[45:49.75]I'm just going this way.
[45:50.71]I've... This is the right way, I think.
[45:52.24]This is fine.
[45:52.60]Let's go.
[45:53.64]This is the right way?
[45:54.24]Alright.
[45:54.64]Through the big pumpkins?
[45:55.56]Yeah.
[45:56.44]Alright, going in this way.
[45:58.34]Here we go.
[45:58.96]I can't run!
[46:12.60]I have to burn this into my fucking memory because like I keep just forgetting where I'm going I think we can probably yep this is good so alright well
[46:37.65]Alright, so that's straight away.
[46:39.13]These two paths are completely... Oh, well, there's a junkie that goes nowhere.
[46:43.59]We can draw a map.
[46:46.91]Mental map.
[46:49.63]Dead ends.
[46:50.15]It's a dead end.
[46:51.87]What's that noise?
[46:54.04]Way too many dead ends.
[46:55.04]That sounds like a buggy.
[46:56.88]That sounds like a buggy bug.
[46:58.28]I'm not kidding.
[47:00.10]Don't go downstairs.
[47:00.86]This is the only way.
[47:03.70]What do you mean it's the only way?
[47:05.30]It's the only way with the bug, man.
[47:10.47]There's nothing in here.
[47:11.21]There's a shiny object in the corner.
[47:14.67]Oh, that's a... Did I blow it up?
[47:16.61]Did I blow it up?
[47:17.29]No, I didn't.
[47:17.75]Okay.
[47:18.15]I thought it was... I thought it was like a hubcap.
[47:20.96]We actually died.
[47:21.60]We're rationalizing us dying right now.
[47:23.96]You did it.
[47:27.42]It's all your fault.
[47:28.56]I thought it was a frisbee.
[47:30.50]You killed two people.
[47:34.15]That's a dead end, I think.
[47:35.79]Is it a dead end?
[47:36.41]It is.
[47:36.71]What the hell?
[47:37.82]Yeah, judging by the fact that I see no doors, I think it is.
[47:41.92]What if it's a hidden door?
[47:42.72]Oh, I hear somebody.
[47:43.74]Wait, run?
[47:44.35]Where are we running from?
[47:46.37]There's a dumper.
[47:47.05]There's a dumper that way.
[47:49.59]A dumper?
[47:50.09]A monster?
[47:50.53]A dumper.
[48:00.98]Poke, what are you doing?
[48:02.06]Poke, what happened?
[48:02.82]What just happened?
[48:05.08]Are you making it come up here?
[48:07.87]Why don't make it come up the stairs?
[48:33.79]Oh, this is fucked up, Pogue.
[48:41.62]Uh-oh.
[48:43.62]Oh, dude.
[48:44.64]What the hell is that?
[48:45.73]That's right.
[48:47.09]Okay.
[48:50.28]Did you make it?
[48:50.62]I just closed it on myself.
[48:57.48]I hope I got the point across.
[48:59.18]You got it.
[48:59.54]You got it.
[48:59.96]Alright.
[49:00.32]Look at that.
[49:00.70]We got it.
[49:01.12]One bolt.
[49:02.30]The La Cretora is on the stairs.
[49:04.18]One key, two keys, bolt.
[49:06.27]Alright.
[49:06.65]That's a profit.
[49:07.51]That's awful.
[49:09.75]Are we bolting with the bolts?
[49:11.65]Alright.
[49:12.35]One key, kettle, one bolt.
[49:14.07]What about the fire exit?
[49:16.19]We can make a killer teapot with a big hole in it.
[49:21.23]How much does this teapot even worth?
[49:22.25]Like 30 bucks?
[49:22.57]Isn't there a fire exit we could maybe find?
[49:25.45]Alright.
[49:27.11]Okay.
[49:30.67]Uh, yeah.
[49:32.77]I don't think I care about the fire exit anymore.
[49:35.49]It sounds like someone's on the phone talking.
[49:39.44]Yeah, I don't know about the fire exit anymore.
[49:42.40]I don't know.
[49:43.02]I don't even know anymore.
[49:46.34]Uh-oh.
[49:47.22]Warning.
[49:48.04]Radiation has increased by 70%.
[49:50.93]That's a bad message.
[49:54.30]Sir, I haven't picked an item up off the ground.
[49:58.70]Wait, are you going to make it look like I did this?
[50:00.10]Yeah, yeah.
[50:01.14]Good job.
[50:01.38]Alright, dude.
[50:02.92]I always got you and you always got me.
[50:06.16]You know that, right?
[50:06.84]Oh, he's fucked.
[50:07.32]That boss was going to fire you.
[50:09.20]Oh, that's a bumper for sure.
[50:10.66]When all cards on the table, I got you, you got me.
[50:13.64]And I know that for a fact.
[50:15.88]I would cradle you like a baby.
[50:17.28]Here we go.
[50:20.56]I would cradle you like an adult.
[50:22.20]Guys, Ster doesn't have any items.
[50:23.96]He didn't come back with anything.
[50:25.48]Good thing I did.
[50:27.37]Good job, Jerma.
[50:27.99]Nice work, Jerry.
[50:28.45]You collected that bolt all on your own.
[50:29.97]I saw it.
[50:30.35]That's not true.
[50:30.75]I got a key.
[50:32.34]Oh.
[50:32.82]Now look who's the favor.
[50:34.68]Ooh.
[50:36.40]Sneak is still somehow looking at this creature.
[50:38.98]I don't know what's happening.
[50:40.12]Yeah.
[50:40.70]Is he dead?
[50:41.54]I think he's dead.
[50:42.96]That might be dead.
[50:43.76]He looks like dead.
[50:45.46]He does not look like he's moving at all.
[50:47.13]Guys, there's something outside.
[50:47.85]Do you guys hear anything?
[50:49.71]Okay.
[50:50.43]Oh, oh, oh.
[50:52.73]I didn't do that?
[50:54.05]He's actually up here now.
[50:55.47]Is he on the roof?
[51:19.80]Yeah, look at the camera.
[51:20.72]This is the old hand in the middle of the thing.
[51:24.17]It could be anyone.
[51:25.05]He's not getting back.
[51:28.11]Is even going the right direction.
[51:29.93]Oh my God, his knees are so weird.
[51:33.55]It's like he's lost.
[51:34.63]He's like he's lost in the Badlands.
[51:36.45]You know what I'm saying, folk?
[51:37.53]Oh, Ster.
[51:38.21]I'm real sorry.
[51:39.36]Oopsie made a work reference.
[51:42.22]Might as well.
[51:42.80]I think he's dead.
[51:43.56]What the fuck?
[51:45.72]Um.
[51:46.26]Why?
[51:46.56]Wait, what happened?
[51:49.14]Yeah, why?
[51:50.67]What's wrong with her?
[51:51.67]What are you doing?
[51:52.65]What is he doing?
[51:53.61]Like, actually, what are you doing?
[51:54.89]Hey, do you think the giant guy eats the giant pumpkins?
[52:12.85]Alright, can we leave before Sterk kills everybody in here?
[52:15.63]No, we need to get Ross back, right?
[52:18.22]Is Ross almost here?
[52:18.92]Should we wait?
[52:20.36]I mean, do we just leave without Ross?
[52:22.74]Where is he?
[52:23.16]He's so lost.
[52:23.64]He's in the way.
[52:25.59]He's like four miles off course right now.
[52:28.31]He has no items.
[52:29.69]Give him 20 seconds.
[52:30.33]20 seconds.
[52:35.00]Are you giving him 20 seconds?
[52:36.32]I'm gonna give him 20 seconds.
[52:37.92]Okay, that's fair.
[52:38.64]Alright, the 20 seconds are up.
[52:39.63]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[52:40.25]I'm just reading the creature lore in the Pokedex.
[52:44.95]I'm gonna figure out their weakness.
[52:48.73]Scan this if you want.
[52:51.02]If you scan it, you can look it up in the catalog or whatever.
[52:57.94]Is he traveling in a sandworm stomach?
[53:01.37]Something might be dragging him.
[53:02.89]He might not be alive.
[53:04.77]Wait, what?
[53:06.65]He was in the worm's mouth?
[53:11.58]That's actually really funny.
[53:13.66]The out of the game.
[53:16.46]Ross, were you alive?
[53:17.47]Ross was literally walking in the back rooms, dude.
[53:20.96]Yeah, like, I'm trying to get to the fire exit, and I fell into a pit, and I jumped out of the pit after, like, a long time, and then it ended up boundary breaking to, like, the edge of the game.
[53:32.00]Oh, man.
[53:32.90]There's just nothing out there.
[53:35.00]Shit, we thought you were being carried by a sandworm after a certain point.
[53:38.66]No, no, I was just running in a field.
[53:40.73]It was crazy.
[53:42.73]Sorry, I was reading a book.
[53:44.73]It's okay.
[53:45.29]Hey, who's eating food?
[53:47.09]What are you eating?
[53:48.75]I'm eating soup.
[53:50.91]What kind of soup?
[53:52.51]Are you drinking soup or eating soup?
[53:53.87]Yeah, can you eat soup?
[53:54.81]I don't think you can eat soup.
[53:56.87]You can eat the stuff that's in soup.
[53:58.89]Okay, is a hot dog a sandwich?
[54:01.20]Not enough people are high in this lobby to have this conversation right now.
[54:06.62]But you eat soup, by the way.
[54:08.62]Obviously.
[54:09.92]Okay, does a straw have one hole or two?
[54:13.42]One giant one.
[54:15.35]A straw is a hole.
[54:16.57]It is a hole, if you don't watch it.
[54:20.73]Any more of these weird brain busters for me to solve for you?
[54:23.18]Who's even in there?
[54:37.20]Boo.
[54:38.74]Boo.
[54:39.96]Is cereal a soup?
[54:41.01]No, it's not.
[54:43.89]Boo.
[54:46.15]Sir, is cereal a soup?
[54:50.13]Cereal a soup?
[54:51.25]That was just dumb things to say.
[54:55.06]Cereal is a soup if you consider a milk a broth.
[54:57.56]Oh yeah, we did it.
[54:58.30]We did it.
[54:58.70]We did it.
[54:59.84]Yeah, that's true.
[55:01.68]I don't consider milk to be a brothel.
[55:03.50]Get a couple of funny tubers together.
[55:05.17]It's like a cereal restaurant.
[55:06.97]And they can put M&M's on cereal.
[55:10.63]Hey, dude.
[55:11.91]Is this soup?
[55:12.51]Is soup soup or is this soup?
[55:17.18]I don't know.
[55:17.68]I kind of think it's soup because soup is soup when you soup
[55:21.78]Dude, the fucking YouTube title could be like, A BUNCH OF GOOFIES TALK ABOUT SOUP FOR A FEW MINUTES!
[55:27.55]Why laser pointers?
[55:33.99]Shouldn't we get the teleporter?
[55:35.63]Did we get that yet?
[55:36.80]Who is talking?
[55:37.98]No, the title of my video is going to be, Soup Sucks, comma, fuck you.
[55:42.78]I really don't know who's talking.
[55:45.80]You're really not trying to get paid for this one.
[55:47.36]That's not very Rizzler of you.
[55:48.66]Oh my god.
[55:51.31]Do you think YouTube hates tubes?
[55:52.37]Do you think they would call it- Do you think YouTube would make like a demonetization or not?
[55:59.62]Do you think YouTube would uh- Dude, my favorite part about this entire stream so far is Poke cannot tell the difference between all of us talking.
[56:08.50]It's so fucking unbelievably funny.
[56:11.77]I think I have everyone's voice.
[56:13.31]At this point, right?
[56:14.99]I have a flashlight.
[56:15.75]Does it tell?
[56:24.69]Now, okay, we theoretically... Oh my god, who was that?
[56:27.89]What was that?
[56:28.69]Who the fuck is that?
[56:29.83]Whose feedback is fun?
[56:31.69]I don't know who that was.
[56:33.07]I like that.
[56:34.21]Our mics are getting too close together.
[56:36.60]What was that?
[56:37.18]It was one of the monsters.
[56:38.14]It was one of the fucking monsters.
[56:40.28]Was it?
[56:40.68]What if our microphones touched?
[56:43.14]Hear me out.
[56:44.16]Whoa.
[56:44.68]We sell four bodies.
[56:48.16]Teleporters for babies, never mind.
[56:50.12]Come on, we don't need these teleporters for babies.
[56:52.18]Sounds kind of sick.
[57:09.84]I thought we were all just standing in here.
[57:30.00]we would have been able to order stuff but we just left it someone behind it lost yeah I had I had the sign you had the sign I asked oh you did this it's okay I wasn't here I couldn't hear it alright oh you were the only person not in here okay two missions in and the group dynamic begins to crumble I I just I thought we were all just standing around voted off the ship will they survive adversary or will they die
[57:55.93]If we sold the sign, everything would have been fine.
[57:58.27]God damn it.
[57:59.15]Ooh.
[57:59.51]That's some good rhymes.
[58:01.70]Alright.
[58:02.60]We don't need a teleporter.
[58:03.98]We're at it.
[58:04.46]Let's do it.
[58:05.36]I'm trusting you to find a good planet for us.
[58:08.78]Yep.
[58:09.56]Yep.
[58:09.76]Alright.
[58:10.70]Uh-huh.
[58:11.88]Uh-huh.
[58:13.70]Monster, did you get some walkie-talkies?
[58:14.78]Did you get some flashlights?
[58:15.64]What were you thinking?
[58:16.48]I can't think of walkie-talkies.
[58:19.32]Sorry.
[58:20.82]Oh, yeah.
[58:21.12]Oh, I've pressed it.
[58:23.42]I've pressed it quite a few times.
[58:25.18]Cracking, can you buy me another flashlight?
[58:26.66]Are you trying to leave too?
[58:28.06]I'm not trying to leave, no.
[58:29.10]No, no, no, no, no.
[58:29.78]Definitely not.
[58:32.16]I feel like I was hearing you trying to leave.
[58:35.89]The budget is often the primary factor in couples who are unhappy.
[58:45.61]Alright, let's go.
[58:47.41]Why are you talking like a How It's Made video, but with divorce?
[58:50.89]Because I'm the observer.
[58:52.45]I don't... I'm just here.
[58:54.27]Like, I'm documenting this crew.
[58:56.45]Okay.
[58:57.73]I have a special request.
[58:59.81]I have a special request from everybody that's not coached.
[59:06.80]Can everyone start talking like this?
[59:09.18]Maybe at the end here.
[59:13.09]What are you doing?
[59:13.94]What are you doing?
[59:14.78]What are you doing?
[59:15.28]What are you doing?
[59:15.82]What are you doing?
[59:16.46]What are you doing?
[59:17.22]What are you doing?
[59:20.94]Why would someone do that?
[59:22.66]Because it's worth a hundred if you sell it.
[59:24.82]Yeah, but you get to do that at the end, no?
[59:27.35]It's a good point.
[59:28.33]Okay.
[59:29.37]If you have a chainsaw in your hand and you're running at people with a chainsaw, go, no, no, no.
[59:33.87]It's worth a hundred bucks.
[59:34.67]It's worth a hundred.
[59:35.27]People are going to run.
[59:36.81]Oh my god.
[59:37.47]You're chasing people with a chainsaw.
[59:39.03]Guys, the ice cream truck.
[59:40.73]Ice cream truck's here.
[59:41.51]I ordered a flashlight.
[59:42.40]Hopefully there's a mouthful.
[59:43.70]Fuck me.
[59:44.26]Fuck you.
[59:45.94]There's flashlights.
[59:47.02]Alright, cool.
[59:48.38]Flashlights.
[59:49.60]One, two.
[59:49.88]I'm taking one of these.
[59:51.50]Can I get the other one?
[59:52.62]I got three.
[59:53.30]I need four.
[59:55.38]I'll get it.
[59:55.82]Here.
[59:57.80]Thank you.
[59:58.74]Who needs another flashlight?
[59:59.80]We all just got promoted.
[60:01.62]I don't have a flashlight.
[60:02.88]No, you do.
[60:03.30]Thanks.
[60:05.55]Alright, let's make this a good one.
[60:07.77]What's the other beehive?
[60:09.55]Uh, there's a second one?
[60:10.89]It does.
[60:11.49]Oh, God.
[60:11.99]Okay, great.
[60:12.65]Yellow.
[60:12.95]100 bucks each.
[60:15.13]That's a lot.
[60:15.49]100 bucks a battery.
[60:16.30]That's a lot of money.
[60:17.62]Okay.
[60:18.34]I'm going to put my flashlight in the ground.
[60:21.26]Uh, Crikey, can you distract the bees?
[60:23.54]I'm going to run and grab them.
[60:25.84]No, no.
[60:26.28]Oh, no.
[60:26.88]Okay.
[60:33.12]I did it!
[60:33.70]What?
[60:33.86]Oh, oh, oh.
[60:34.40]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[60:37.18]Just run, run, run.
[60:38.89]We're good.
[60:39.63]I did?
[61:05.29]I didn't kill everyone, did I?
[61:07.89]Did I kill everyone?
[61:08.79]No, I didn't, did I?
[61:19.34]Okay, well what if I go collect all their bodies and bring it in one by one?
[61:24.92]Where did they die?
[61:34.28]Oh shit, OK.
[61:40.15]Why do I hear the bees?
[61:42.77]OK, I'm about to.
[61:43.51]I'm about to come in with a body.
[61:45.31]Etalyx.
[61:47.51]Wait, the bees are inside.
[61:48.67]The bees are inside.
[61:49.72]Don't go in.
[61:50.32]The bees are inside.
[61:51.18]The bees are inside.
[61:52.70]The bees are inside.
[61:53.58]I dropped the body off close by.
[61:55.56]What are they doing inside?
[61:58.02]OK, hold on, hold on.
[61:59.56]I dropped the body.
[62:00.20]I'm going to go lure them out.
[62:02.10]Oh, God, this is bad.
[62:03.98]The hive is inside, so they're following the hive.
[62:11.87]Yeah, but they should... Wait, what?
[62:14.45]Yeah, there's like hives inside, so they're defending their hives inside the base.
[62:20.75]Okay.
[62:21.23]Alright, Etalyx.
[62:23.33]Don't tell anybody that this happened.
[62:25.83]Okay.
[62:27.01]I'm telling everyone.
[62:29.62]I saw everything.
[62:31.48]Were you up there the whole time?
[62:33.62]No.
[62:34.72]Just when it was convenient.
[62:37.22]Do you want me to lead him away?
[62:39.93]Can we?
[62:40.79]I feel like we can.
[62:41.83]Bees, oh bees.
[62:44.97]I think you have to like grab the hive to lead this away.
[62:47.78]Yeah, and who turned the light off in there?
[62:49.98]Who turned off the light in there?
[62:52.28]They were.
[62:52.76]Oh my God.
[62:53.20]Dude, I. We launched the ship.
[62:55.76]That's the mine.
[63:18.14]Alright, listen.
[63:20.00]Let me apologize real quick.
[63:22.12]I did not know that the bees would stay inside the ship.
[63:27.34]Yeah.
[63:31.03]It happens.
[63:32.69]It happens to the best of us.
[63:34.43]Was that... Hang on, were there two hives?
[63:37.73]There are two hives in there now.
[63:39.12]Oh, there's two hives?
[63:40.54]There's two hives in there?
[63:41.64]Yeah.
[63:43.98]Well, only one had bees because it was too close to the door.
[63:48.07]I think.
[63:48.35]That might have been my fault because I ran into the ship to get away.
[63:53.83]I was a chump and I died to the outside bees.
[63:55.89]I didn't even... Oh yeah.
[63:56.75]That's weird.
[63:57.25]We can't... Because of the minion outfit, it's worth nothing.
[64:03.69]And I don't... Do they know that the bees are in here?
[64:07.90]I think we're good to go.
[64:08.68]Why don't we just not press our luck?
[64:10.36]I think Criken and Poke are still alive.
[64:37.06]I think they just got another hive.
[64:42.24]They're coming back.
[64:43.14]Yeah, yeah.
[64:44.23]We got two hives in here, right?
[64:47.39]Why are there not two?
[64:49.45]Yeah, they should do that.
[64:51.55]Where's the nest?
[64:54.13]It's over there.
[64:56.79]Oh, was the lights going crazy earlier?
[64:58.96]Yeah, the remote turns them off.
[65:01.42]I think everybody's home.
[65:03.55]They had to get it out.
[65:04.23]That's just 200 bucks.
[65:04.83]I can do that.
[65:05.27]I already dropped my flashlight.
[65:06.37]I'll go do it.
[65:06.87]You distract him.
[65:07.77]I'll swoop in and grab that hive.
[65:17.72]I didn't know that if they were that close that they would stay on the hive.
[65:21.24]I thought they just ran away.
[65:22.17]He's getting chased by a different hive.
[65:42.03]There's another one?
[65:42.95]Yeah, the other one's in the shed.
[65:46.87]Sneak, run!
[65:47.57]Grab it!
[65:48.31]Oh, because I know the second one.
[65:49.19]I just thought there was a third one.
[65:50.59]I didn't hear you laugh.
[65:52.69]Yeah, I know.
[65:53.67]We got it.
[65:55.25]Are they faster than default move speed?
[65:58.07]It's getting... Yep, the sprint.
[65:59.85]I have faith in Vitalik.
[66:02.77]The dogs are going to show up.
[66:04.63]Yeah.
[66:05.93]What?
[66:06.41]They didn't even try that time.
[66:08.19]Alright, I'm getting close to dead.
[66:11.71]Oh, he got it, he got it, he got it.
[66:12.83]Oh, Talos is dead.
[66:15.19]Get ready.
[66:16.67]Where's, where's Talos?
[66:19.58]Talos is dead.
[66:21.66]He was a hero though, dude.
[66:22.70]I got out.
[66:23.06]You don't fuck around, you shut the door and you go.
[66:27.46]You think he's mad?
[66:40.83]You can just watch this fly off of me.
[66:46.17]Oh my god.
[66:46.83]They don't know that I'm dead.
[66:49.42]That was amazing.
[66:50.72]We know now.
[66:51.64]Guys, that's already 317 credits.
[66:53.24]You guys, I wasn't watching you leave because the bees got me outside.
[66:56.38]Oh, the bees are worth 113.
[66:57.66]Yeah, 113.
[67:10.48]Well, all I gotta say is I'm sorry.
[67:12.12]Before we take off again, Connor wants to join.
[67:14.40]Did you bring the bees inside, Jerma?
[67:17.85]Alright, we have... Weather's looking kind of rough right now, guys.
[67:24.50]Are we feeling some fog, some stormy, or some flooded?
[67:29.07]Oh, surely some stormy.
[67:31.91]Surely some stormy for the silly.
[67:35.15]I'm gonna make it the whole round this time, I promise.
[67:37.77]The other two are just not fun.
[67:39.61]Stormy is at least funny if somebody gets bopped.
[67:42.96]Alright, we'll go for the silly.
[67:45.98]Before you play your game too much, those maps aren't even fun.
[67:53.39]Oh, let me see.
[67:56.33]I don't think we can while we're up here.
[67:57.83]If you land... We should... Remember, if we all die, we lose all the money.
[68:04.26]So be careful in the storm.
[68:06.30]Should we get walkie-talkies?
[68:09.02]We could get a walkie-talkie.
[68:21.46]Hey, what's up?
[68:27.29]Let's get like ten more people in here.
[68:30.97]I was just talking to Lutz.
[68:33.17]Lutz has six.
[68:35.31]Alright, we have to increasingly make this absurd and then we all are just going to break off and play the game.
[68:44.17]Yeah, that's okay.
[68:45.76]Fuck it.
[68:46.14]Why not?
[68:47.99]Based on the letters, it kind of feels like we're winning.
[68:52.28]Can I go third person?
[68:53.55]How does this game work?
[68:54.67]You can look at me.
[68:55.41]This is your first time.
[68:58.62]Yeah, it's my first time.
[68:59.70]We can hold hands through this.
[69:00.98]I just played with, like, a child.
[69:02.12]Like, I joined an MLB and there was, like, a four-year-old I played with for, like, three minutes.
[69:07.49]Oh, Kirby.
[69:08.99]He actually looks like Luigi.
[69:10.07]Oh, my God.
[69:11.17]And he's literally Luigi.
[69:12.73]Nobody else can be the Minion, by the way.
[69:15.31]Now you get to play with four-year-olds who have professional microphones.
[69:17.95]That's true.
[69:19.86]That's me.
[69:25.92]I'm ready.
[69:26.48]I'm ready.
[69:26.94]I'm ready.
[69:27.32]Alright, let's do it.
[69:29.42]Wait, are you the Kirby costume?
[69:31.52]Don't hold metal and also be careful of quicksand.
[69:35.67]Well, not really quicksand, just like sinking.
[69:37.69]The lightning on the metal works like Breath of the Wild.
[69:40.37]That game sucks.
[69:41.21]What happened?
[69:41.69]There's lightning.
[69:52.09]Yeah, it's gonna keep happening.
[69:54.46]So just as long as you're holding metal, it's gonna keep happening.
[69:57.14]I just was trying to start an argument with one of them.
[69:59.88]I figured somebody would turn around and be like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[70:06.04]I think somebody just exploded.
[70:07.44]It's a little stormy out.
[70:08.42]Taking cover under tall metal pipes in a lightning storm.
[70:22.10]It's a hard jump, Polk.
[70:23.06]It's a hard jump.
[70:23.72]Alright, this one sucks.
[70:27.49]Everybody can do it except me.
[70:28.63]Wait, who bought something?
[70:29.63]Oh, okay.
[70:32.09]Wait, who's buying shit?
[70:33.47]Yeah, no, is anyone back there?
[70:37.37]Polk, why are you treating me like I'm a monster?
[70:38.97]What are you doing like this?
[70:46.20]Are you still behind me?
[70:46.82]Are you still behind me?
[70:54.54]Gonna put him down.
[70:55.14]Gonna put him down.
[70:55.88]Gonna put him down right here.
[70:57.44]Gonna go.
[70:58.41]Alright, let's do... What the hell?
[71:08.23]Jerry, I was muted.
[71:09.29]Oh, what's up?
[71:09.97]What's the hitbox on this?
[71:28.06]That's unfortunate.
[71:29.30]I think they probably all did.
[71:31.16]Yeah.
[71:35.78]Who's this?
[71:36.32]I need the way to illuminate.
[71:40.60]It's Jerry!
[71:42.07]Just watch out.
[71:42.57]What's the hitbox?
[71:44.01]There's a machine gun over here.
[71:45.89]Stepping on it's the hitbox.
[71:47.75]There's a huh?
[71:53.89]Oh man, do I actually have to do that?
[71:55.55]I don't think you can turn those off.
[71:57.97]Someone on the ship has to turn it off.
[72:02.27]That was so over the top.
[72:04.37]Watch out, don't turn that corner.
[72:11.77]Oh, this is wonderful.
[72:15.35]He's right behind me, he's right behind me!
[72:18.19]Jesus, come on man, get away from me!
[72:21.89]He's behind me and he won't leave me alone.
[72:23.85]Exit.
[72:24.43]Wish I had a walkie talkie right now.
[72:44.37]It's not still there, right?
[72:58.00]This is probably gone by now.
[73:13.82]Should I not do it?
[73:14.54]Because I'll just run away.
[73:15.56]I don't know where the main entrance is though.
[73:19.90]Oh!
[73:30.68]Stop being a weenie?
[73:44.71]Hello?
[73:45.51]Hey!
[73:52.75]The fire exit's down here if you need it!
[73:55.44]To me!
[73:55.82]Come to my voice!
[73:56.56]Fire exit!
[73:59.53]Fire exit!
[74:00.88]I got the fire exit.
[74:02.36]Where are you?
[74:03.76]Where's the fire?
[74:05.94]I am above.
[74:06.88]Up top.
[74:07.96]Up to the top level.
[74:09.36]Fire exit is up on the top level.
[74:11.06]I repeat, if you can hear this message, come to the top level of the level.
[74:18.35]Hello?
[74:23.59]Hey, fire exit's right behind me.
[74:25.57]Why are there dead bodies all over?
[74:30.28]It was a whole thing.
[74:32.94]Oh, okay.
[74:34.08]Are they still alive?
[74:35.14]Fire exits behind me through that door.
[74:37.66]Well, I'm going to go this way because it's the regular way.
[74:41.16]Oh, give me some of this stuff.
[74:46.03]You guys good?
[74:47.47]There's stuff out here.
[74:48.29]Come on, bring stuff back.
[74:49.55]What the fuck?
[74:50.93]Don't go back there.
[74:51.91]What?
[74:52.11]What the hell happened?
[75:01.32]I'm so confused.
[75:02.52]Oh, if he doesn't pick him up right now, he's dead.
[75:06.36]What happened?
[75:08.04]We just gotta leave.
[75:09.96]Oh, he's gotta go.
[75:10.98]Okay.
[75:12.14]And get out of there.
[75:13.60]You saw him.
[75:14.92]Nope.
[75:15.46]Oil head?
[75:16.94]Wait, where's Vinny going?
[75:19.84]Yo, did everybody die by lightning outside?
[75:22.32]Rest in peace, Connor.
[75:27.92]I got shot.
[75:28.66]We made it like 20 feet away.
[75:31.54]25 feet.
[75:34.54]At least one of us lived.
[75:37.10]No.
[75:37.44]You looked right at him?
[75:38.20]Was there a thing that was down the hall?
[75:41.94]Yeah, it's like a springhead thing.
[75:44.58]Oh, I thought that was something else.
[75:45.98]I didn't think it was that.
[75:46.72]Never even seen a coil in there.
[75:48.90]Really?
[75:49.28]Oh, this is so good.
[75:52.80]How does a coil head work?
[75:54.14]What do they do?
[75:54.72]Yeah, this thing on the right side of the wall.
[75:56.13]I saw the bug.
[75:57.31]I was watching whoever it was run back and forth.
[75:59.51]It was really funny.
[76:00.49]What the hell?
[76:18.32]He has to live he has to just get in there and turn the fucking thing on
[76:33.37]Oh, my God.
[76:34.61]This is all.
[76:36.82]He needs to be on the ship.
[76:38.00]If it leaves without him.
[76:40.80]Oh, my God.
[76:42.70]Oh, my God.
[76:44.68]Oh, my God.
[76:44.98]Oh, my God.
[76:46.12]I'm so sorry, by the way.
[76:47.72]It's like it's just me right now.
[76:50.70]Alright.
[76:51.88]It's OK.
[76:52.58]It's alright.
[76:55.24]It was, you know, I loved it.
[76:57.24]I think we should vote.
[76:59.02]Yeah.
[76:59.28]Everyone right.
[76:59.74]Click to vote early.
[77:00.92]Alright.
[77:03.32]Holy shit.
[77:04.53]Alright.
[77:05.77]Time to skedaddle.
[77:06.65]How did I get killed?
[77:07.93]I jumped over the lightning.
[77:11.17]I jumped over metal.
[77:13.61]I think because I had no metal on me.
[77:15.15]You just got hit in the air.
[77:17.71]That was the worst timing ever.
[77:20.67]Yeah.
[77:21.19]It was pretty bad.
[77:21.79]That's ridiculous.
[77:22.64]Does anyone have a view of that?
[77:23.82]Which part?
[77:26.74]Definitely.
[77:28.48]I always zoom in on you.
[77:31.02]Yeah, I was watching from a distance.
[77:32.85]Very funny.
[77:34.47]Wow.
[77:35.81]I had a great spectator of Jerma getting eaten.
[77:39.03]I'm gonna watch where you're going, Vinny.
[77:40.86]That was crazy.
[77:42.00]It's the funniest fucking shit.
[77:45.09]And then you were the last person alive, too.
[77:47.49]Dude, I think I gave myself a headache from laughing so hard at that.
[77:51.87]Wait.
[77:52.67]What?
[77:52.91]Profit quota.
[77:53.93]It says zero.
[77:55.45]Wait, what?
[77:56.05]We don't have any right now.
[77:58.57]Yeah, we have to sell first.
[78:01.41]Ready to win.
[78:01.95]Oh, you're a fellow minion.
[78:03.01]We're good.
[78:03.49]We're feeling pretty good.
[78:06.45]Yeah, I just I looked at one of those things down the hall and I looked for too long and I turned the game and snap my neck I
[78:24.37]Alright, gang.
[78:24.91]We're gonna try and eclipse the planet.
[78:27.73]We have four walkie-talkies now.
[78:30.45]Can I have a flashlight?
[78:34.35]I'll do walkie-talkie.
[78:35.68]I'm good with the walkie-talkie because I never shut the fuck up.
[78:38.06]So I'll be perfect here.
[78:39.16]Yeah, dude.
[78:39.90]That's my specialty.
[78:41.28]We need at least one person to live so we can do the cool planets after this.
[78:46.10]Who's gonna stay in the ships?
[78:47.44]Not me.
[78:47.80]I will stay in the ship.
[78:54.96]Are you sure how do you do the cool?
[78:56.78]Yeah, okay
[79:18.04]Is that okay?
[79:19.54]Yeah, if I just figure it out.
[79:21.34]You'll see in the door like a red number or something like that.
[79:23.42]Okay.
[79:23.52]Do I need a walkie talkie?
[79:24.27]I guess I'm doing it.
[79:24.97]Maybe just come with us and then run back if it gets bad.
[79:38.19]I think Connor needs some real world experience here first.
[79:44.04]I'll stay behind.
[79:45.74]I will stay behind.
[79:46.54]Why don't you let Connor experience the eclipse?
[79:48.46]I can stay back.
[79:50.54]I experienced something.
[79:51.60]I just kind of walked out and died.
[79:52.94]Oh, I've never seen an eclipse.
[79:54.05]I've never seen an eclipse.
[79:54.73]Can I see?
[79:55.41]Yeah, go ahead.
[79:56.65]I'll stay.
[79:57.27]Oh, cool.
[79:57.91]Nice.
[79:58.63]Thank you.
[80:01.51]I just need like a buddy system
[80:27.50]Be my buddy.
[80:29.50]Connor's dead in 30 seconds.
[80:30.82]I found a walkie-talkie.
[80:32.00]We're in luck.
[80:32.42]I got Connor.
[80:34.05]Okay.
[80:34.49]Vinny also has a walkie-talkie.
[80:35.91]Hello.
[80:37.37]I got Connor.
[80:37.85]I got Polk.
[80:38.43]Sneak has a walkie-talkie.
[80:42.07]Wait, I see the dog.
[80:43.53]I have an issue with it.
[80:45.57]Guys, be quiet.
[80:46.57]This thing's the thing.
[80:56.43]Everybody was talking, and it came from me first?
[81:03.06]Oh, come on.
[81:05.50]There were ten people there.
[81:08.28]Everyone's running, scattering, talking, and it comes, it kills me.
[81:12.66]Uh...
[81:21.90]We're so fucked.
[81:22.93]It's because you sprinted?
[81:27.61]Oh god damn it.
[81:29.97]You can't run when those things are around.
[81:31.73]I just forgot what that thing even did and what it even does.
[81:37.97]Yeah, me too.
[81:50.27]I laughed too loud.
[81:51.27]I was laughing too loud.
[81:52.75]The walkie-talkie mod is not helping.
[81:54.79]Oh no.
[81:54.91]Get the crouch bot.
[81:55.45]Oh god, really?
[81:55.99]Oh, he is.
[81:56.37]Yeah, he's no idea.
[81:57.07]Connor and I have entered from the fire escape.
[81:58.77]How's it doing on the ship?
[82:20.73]We got some dead around the ship.
[82:22.61]Over.
[82:24.69]He's gonna get grabbed.
[82:27.59]Don't worry about it.
[82:28.13]Just let me know if you're coming and I'll open the door.
[82:29.91]Over.
[82:30.09]Roger that.
[82:32.11]Now, the door does open automatically, by the way, on a timer, so make sure you're on top of that.
[82:36.93]Sneak, you got a monster to your 3 o'clock.
[82:41.75]I can't count.
[82:42.33]Where's 3 o'clock?
[82:43.95]Okay.
[82:44.33]To your... If you turn around, it'll be on your left.
[82:47.83]Yeah, dead ahead.
[82:49.51]Pick up something else to see it.
[82:52.13]Oh, for the.
[82:54.19]Somebody said it.
[82:55.57]There always there has to be a first person and it was you.
[82:58.76]It's true.
[83:01.24]It does have to be a first person.
[83:05.16]24 seven.
[83:07.40]You need some coke?
[83:08.10]Do I like?
[83:09.56]Do you see what's going on here?
[83:16.11]You're gonna get us killed man!
[83:18.81]Singing in the fucking hallway!
[83:20.25]Chill out!
[83:21.79]What's wrong with you?
[83:27.83]He's so confused.
[83:29.21]You're gonna get us killed just singing in the hallway.
[83:32.05]Oh my god.
[83:32.91]Yeah I know.
[83:35.33]I see what you're doing.
[83:38.25]I see what you're doing.
[83:39.83]You're gonna get us fucking killed!
[83:42.44]What?
[83:47.31]Did he leave?
[83:50.73]Why did you leave?
[83:51.57]Why did he leave?
[83:53.28]What happened?
[83:55.46]Oh my god.
[83:57.14]Why?
[83:57.54]Why?
[83:58.16]I don't know what happened.
[84:01.94]Ster.
[84:02.62]Ster.
[84:03.42]You have the floor.
[84:04.47]Ster.
[84:05.69]You have the floor.
[84:07.37]Guys, I'm going to say it right now.
[84:10.81]Red was so sus.
[84:12.19]I saw him.
[84:13.33]You can turn the radio off.
[84:16.24]Okay, so you had a dog behind you.
[84:19.74]Like, you didn't even know about it, so I get why he told you to stop talking, but also, you left?
[84:24.84]No, I didn't leave!
[84:28.74]Oh, were you doing that because you got so much money?
[84:32.12]Alright.
[84:32.54]Everyone was just going to die coming back.
[84:34.78]So let's get everybody to kill ourselves.
[84:40.21]I mean, making decisions as if he's in a leadership position all over again, which even though might have been the right call, I can't stand behind that.
[84:50.45]We have a process here.
[84:52.31]Three or four of you memorize this area.
[84:53.77]15 monsters.
[84:56.95]Three or four of you come with a decision and then you come to me.
[84:59.07]And then I make the final decision.
[85:01.99]I thought we were under the impression that was what was happening.
[85:06.44]Three or four of you come to a consensus.
[85:08.26]Then you come to me.
[85:09.58]And then I decide.
[85:10.70]I love how I'm always just off in the corner monologuing to no one.
[85:23.21]I do that because I don't want to like talk over their streams.
[85:25.43]You know what I mean?
[85:26.05]I'm just trying to talk to you guys.
[85:28.87]They dance.
[85:29.93]The Oinkysplinky does not exist in this universe.
[85:32.09]I'm sorry to say.
[85:33.39]We can use another 100 bucks and we can go to a tier 3 planet.
[85:36.59]I invented the Oinkysplinky without the Y in the beginning.
[85:39.97]Where is the fucking light switch?
[85:41.91]Grow up.
[85:42.95]I don't know.
[85:43.35]Has everyone seen the light switch?
[85:45.01]So we can go to one of the crazy planets?
[85:51.47]Where's the mod to tell?
[85:52.57]Where is the fucking light switch?
[85:54.23]Where is it?
[85:54.69]Honestly, if the devs want to put something in, do a mod that says who flicked the lights off.
[85:58.23]So then we know who to kick from the party.
[85:59.56]It wasn't me.
[86:08.26]Hit him with the sign.
[86:09.90]Hit him with the sign.
[86:10.56]Somebody kill him with the sign.
[86:33.55]Oh my god, fine.
[86:35.03]Okay, what planet are we going to?
[86:36.22]Alright, everyone get on the ship.
[86:38.04]Let's have no more people left behind.
[86:39.72]What planet?
[86:42.00]Skibidi plop, plop, plop, plop, Skibidi plop.
[86:44.90]Did you guys just do that in unison?
[86:50.29]Did you just sneeze?
[86:52.29]What was that?
[86:53.23]God bless you.
[86:54.47]Did you do that?
[87:00.32]Hey, hey Vinny.
[87:03.21]Vinny I haven't seen I haven't seen hey Hey, I haven't seen Skibidi Toilets in Skibidi Toilet if 46

[87:46.29]I already spent the money.
[87:48.81]We're going to be a dine, guys.
[87:52.00]The dine is a cliffs currently, which means there's going to be something about a toilet.
[87:56.94]Something about a toilet.
[87:59.60]We're here for three days.
[88:00.54]Unless we're unlucky.
[88:01.74]Unless we're really unlucky.
[88:05.13]We'll make enough money and then we can buy a toilet and you can see all your heart ones.
[88:09.05]Okay.
[88:09.49]Oh, thank you I have so much energy
[88:25.52]oh no try we have to try hard on this one this is a scammy one

[88:51.68]Is that the gorillas?
[88:52.88]Yeah.
[88:53.28]Oh my god.
[88:58.32]There's a giant.
[89:01.06]There's a giant.
[89:01.82]It's gonna grab one of us.
[89:04.25]No, it's not me.
[89:05.71]Is the game making that noise?
[89:09.97]No, stop.
[89:11.49]Stop talking though.
[89:12.59]They'll grab us.
[89:13.95]Uh oh.
[89:14.45]What the fuck?
[89:15.11]Why is everybody running?
[89:16.67]Yep.
[89:34.78]Yeah.
[89:35.44]What the fuck is all this?
[89:39.12]Resident Evil!
[89:40.00]I'll take it.
[89:40.52]You alright?
[89:41.08]I'm turning up the brightness.
[89:44.10]Sorry, I'm making one of those POV walk around the city videos.
[90:10.41]I didn't think there was more than just metal rooms.
[90:16.33]Guys, there's something about this place you should know.
[90:19.87]What?
[90:20.75]If you hear Pop goes the weasel, we need to fucking run.
[90:24.57]Pop goes the weasel?
[90:26.53]Etalyx, this is a bad idea to be running.
[90:32.82]Okay, we're alright.
[90:34.78]Yeah, we're good.
[90:36.55]Oh, what?
[90:37.33]Anything behind this bookcase?
[90:43.58]I don't think so.
[90:48.01]Okay, dude.
[90:50.95]One at a time.
[90:51.67]Alright, you go first.
[90:57.40]Right.
[90:58.22]It's just a bookcase.
[91:05.56]If I had a walkie talkie, I would be screaming into it right now.
[91:23.07]And she's going to be standing right in front of me and I'm going to scream and you're going to say, what little girl?
[91:27.29]Uh, Jerma, there's some weird shit going on right now.
[91:33.10]There's weird shit going on?
[91:34.78]Where?
[91:35.06]Yeah, I'm haunted.
[91:38.06]Ross is haunted and he said there's a PNG of a bald little girl that's going to pop up and it's going to get weird.
[91:43.81]Really?
[91:44.09]Yeah, and so when you hear me screaming because I see a bald little weird little wrinkly girl, you guys aren't going to see it and I'm going to scream and you're going to be like... Well, you get the scarier experience.
[91:58.38]It's true, but if I die, then the haunting passes on to someone else, I think.
[92:04.58]I'm completely lost.
[92:06.68]This is just like a haunted mansion.
[92:08.36]Oh, dude, this is just like... The nun.
[92:12.64]Coffee mug here.
[92:13.30]Who wants a coffee mug?
[92:14.94]The nun.
[92:15.20]Hey, you coffee.
[92:18.01]Huh.
[92:18.83]That's a... Oh.
[92:22.95]Okay.
[92:23.31]Alright.
[92:26.01]Anybody see anything?
[92:29.99]see you next Friday on the nun the nut oh come on give me a break stupidest goddamn game
[92:42.49]There's a turret.
[92:43.19]Can you hear?
[92:43.69]No, listen up.
[92:44.31]Listen up.
[92:44.61]There's a turret.
[92:45.49]There's a turret in the other room.
[92:47.29]I'm annunciating my voice incredibly well.
[92:49.92]There is a turret in the other room behind me where I came from.
[92:53.00]Do you understand?
[92:53.92]No one can hear anything he said.
[92:57.76]It's like the peanuts.
[92:58.64]They really need to leave.
[93:06.85]Somebody got obliterated by the machine gun.
[93:08.97]It was like it killed like six of you.
[93:10.61]Somebody has to break it out.
[93:12.33]Yeah, the giant's still there.
[93:35.91]What happened?
[93:37.67]What happened that time?
[93:40.63]Two or three people got annihilated by a machine gun.
[93:43.07]I think that's one of the things that happened.
[93:47.50]Ross got haunted by a PNG of a little girl, apparently.
[93:50.06]A wrinkly bald girl.
[93:52.68]Jeremy, you had a bug on your head.
[93:54.08]There was a bug on your head?
[93:55.18]Yeah.
[93:55.36]It made me want to see the nun.
[94:06.30]Oh, Ster has to get out.
[94:10.26]He has to get out.
[94:11.06]Oh, he's so dead.
[94:11.68]Oh, Ster needs to get out.
[94:31.12]I can't even see what's in front of him.
[94:33.56]Uh-oh.
[94:34.20]He's got a freaky robot.
[94:35.56]That's so bad to do right now.
[94:37.23]Wait, the little girl's gonna haunt you.
[94:39.75]Oh, yeah.
[94:39.99]The little girl's gonna come for the robot.
[94:41.99]She's fucking terrifying.
[94:43.03]Wait, is that why that happens?
[94:44.49]What the hell did I miss?
[94:45.53]Spoilers, guys!
[94:47.03]Spoilers!
[94:47.93]Spoilers!
[94:50.77]What?
[94:50.97]I... Ster is a gamer.
[94:51.73]Ster is a real gamer.
[94:52.61]Give him a chance.
[94:53.07]I would say Ster is like a top 10 gamer, I think.
[94:54.51]He got out.
[94:54.87]He got out.
[94:55.19]Look.
[94:55.31]He's a freak.
[95:16.76]Oh my god, he's gonna do it.
[95:17.66]He might actually do it.
[95:19.04]Well, there's a giant outside, so... Oh, he can't say a word.
[95:28.72]Can't even fart.
[95:29.31]Wait.
[95:30.39]He can crouch walk.
[95:31.31]Aw, dude.
[95:32.67]I believe in him.
[95:34.87]He can do this.
[95:36.61]The only thing is that the giant can't hear, but the giant can see, and the thing can.
[95:42.81]Took out that's bad.
[95:44.33]Oh someone distracted a little toy.
[95:46.51]It's a dog he threw the toy what?
[95:49.67]He's gaming dude, there's the ship he's gonna do it shit He's got he's got he's got to go he's gotta go he's gotta go now
[96:05.56]He got it.
[96:06.00]He got it.
[96:06.26]He got it.
[96:06.54]He got it.
[96:06.80]There's somebody in this lobby that could have pulled that off.
[96:13.70]You're looking at him right now.
[96:16.12]Yeah, that way I would have done that.
[96:27.38]I got a key.
[96:31.94]Wow, dude.

[96:41.03]Holy shit.
[96:41.71]God gamer.
[96:43.73]That is very well done.
[96:44.77]I had to drop the fucking robot.
[96:45.87]That is the most impressive shit I've ever seen.
[96:47.75]It flips again.
[96:48.59]What are the chances?
[96:54.10]What?
[96:54.84]Had you died, the ship would have had to leave and we would have lost all of our shit on the ship.
[96:58.70]Oh, does it?
[96:59.24]I didn't know there was no shit on the ship.
[97:01.68]Oh, we got nothing on the ship.
[97:03.00]Never mind.
[97:03.50]Yeah, it was pretty useless.
[97:04.86]You saved us $6.
[97:06.08]Thank you.
[97:07.38]I'm glad it looked cool.
[97:09.89]It's a gift again.
[97:12.01]So literally the same scenario.
[97:13.75]Looks great.

[97:40.07]I'm going to go that way.
[97:42.05]I'm going to go this way.
[97:47.01]It's a scary monster.
[97:50.54]Don't speak.
[98:01.29]Don't speak.
[98:02.69]Notice what you're saying.
[98:06.41]I don't need a reason.
[98:10.39]Don't tell me cause it hurts.
[98:13.93]Don't tell me cause it don't speak.
[98:17.91]I don't miss feeling.
[98:19.87]I don't need to explain.
[98:24.72]Don't tell me cause it hurts.
[98:29.09]Uh, it's funny that you and I only know the, uh, like, Time Magazine presents Songs of the 80s.
[98:36.27]And it's just when- when the- I was gonna say, I didn't- I didn't know those ones.
[98:38.89]Yeah, it's an 80s song.
[98:39.49]When the- when that song goes by in, like, that weird credits list they do in the infomercial, and it's highlighted yellow, we just- that's the only part of the song we know.
[98:48.88]Yeah.
[98:49.58]Yeah.
[98:56.44]Yeah, we made it.
[98:57.12]We lived.
[98:58.41]Alright.
[98:59.03]It's the same place.
[99:04.82]Guys, there's a monster!
[99:07.32]Where?
[99:07.52]Where's the monster?
[99:09.18]I swear to God, I'm... I feel nervous.
[99:11.63]I'm nervous.
[99:13.11]In which door, Polk?
[99:13.85]Which door?
[99:14.19]I hear him roaring.
[99:15.41]Wait, no.
[99:15.79]He's doing a sound bit.
[99:16.57]That's a sound bit.
[99:17.73]Oh, my guy got nervous.
[99:20.37]Is there any monster in this game where you have to be loud and scream at them to get them to go away?
[99:24.52]Huh?
[99:24.64]Yeah.
[99:24.76]Stirr?
[99:24.90]I'm here.
[99:25.08]I'm with the group.
[99:25.54]You want to do Luigi's Mansion, Stirr?
[99:27.04]Alright, let's go.
[99:50.15]Yeah.
[99:51.33]Go.
[99:52.99]Are you guys- Oh, there's a funny thing.
[99:54.43]Oh, there's a funny thing over there.
[99:55.89]Apparently you can step on it.
[99:57.49]Luigi would step on it.
[99:59.40]Oh.
[99:59.48]What happens now?
[100:00.24]Okay, Jermaine can- No, you stay there.
[100:12.96]Pick up this key.
[100:14.44]To get to the next level of Luigi's Mansion, you gotta pick up this key.
[100:23.60]Don't push me!
[100:26.22]Guys, I don't think two people can step on it.
[100:32.22]Dude, I was just- There's like ten people making videos and streams here.
[100:37.12]I was just trying to be a funny- I was trying to be a view for somebody.
[100:42.50]I thought I was gonna explode immediately.
[100:45.48]Ster was making a video and I was trying to make like a funny part of his video.
[100:48.08]Are you live Vitalik?
[101:05.96]Yeah, no, that was kind of the same for me.
[101:09.14]I was just walking around and I exploded.
[101:11.15]It would have been funny if I stood there.
[101:12.81]Who ran into it?
[101:13.25]Was that you Vinny?
[101:29.01]No.
[101:30.01]What?
[101:30.31]Was what me?
[101:31.37]Did you push me off the mine?
[101:33.89]No, I didn't.
[101:34.85]Oh, you were on the mine?
[101:36.78]Yeah.
[101:37.12]Where the hell am I going?
[101:38.46]I didn't know what was happening because I was off on my own.
[101:44.20]And they were talking about Luigi's Mansion, so I was like, oh, let me go in the room and do a Luigi bit.
[101:49.56]My Luigi bit was to jump to where they were looking, which was where you were, I guess, and then we all blowed up.
[101:55.50]What is happening?
[101:56.30]Now it all makes sense.
[101:58.76]Yeah.
[101:59.28]He's doing voice bit.
[101:59.98]That's what happened.
[102:00.70]Oh, golly gosh.
[102:01.76]I think I'll turn around.
[102:05.04]Bewildered by that voice.
[102:06.32]You need a flashlight.
[102:07.25]Is that thing?
[102:07.69]Guys, can you close the door on me?
[102:08.65]Are we serious right now?
[102:13.45]Wait, what's going on in the ship?
[102:16.89]What's going on in the ship?
[102:20.92]Uh, there's a monster right there.
[102:22.80]Hey, sir!
[102:23.30]I'm the monster.
[102:29.21]It's just hitting me right now, Vinny, that you just were walking around.
[102:33.73]I jumped from the back floor near where you were.
[102:37.37]Hey, guys.
[102:38.69]Should we try to head back?
[102:39.67]That's so funny.
[102:45.73]Yeah, that's so funny.
[102:46.95]Polk always looks like he's like panicking in a hurry.
[102:48.49]Every time I go to his POV, it's just he's sprinting.
[102:51.29]Yeah.
[103:15.82]Whoa, what just happened to Poe?
[103:20.00]He just got eaten by a worm.
[103:23.18]You just got grabbed by a worm?
[103:24.42]I looked at Uber Eats for a second.
[103:27.06]I looked at my Uber Eats for a second and it's Poe.
[103:31.01]Oh, God.
[103:33.39]That was so funny.
[103:35.91]What'd you order to the ship?
[103:38.59]Oh, this time I got a Panda Express.
[103:41.71]Ooh, nice, nice.
[103:43.73]Eating good.
[103:45.71]Getting eaten by worms while eating good.
[103:49.79]Eating worms while getting good.
[103:52.39]Yeah, pretty much.
[103:53.23]Do they have anything?
[103:57.92]They have a couple bodies.

[107:33.42]No, that's not true.
[107:35.16]It's not safe.
[107:35.52]We're the only ones left alive.
[107:37.54]It's not safe.
[107:53.83]That's what I'm telling you!

[108:08.70]Okay.
[108:09.10]You ready?
[108:09.68]Yeah.
[108:09.98]We all have to do it.

[108:12.16]Two... One... Go.
[108:17.89]Oh, yep, yep.
[108:18.77]Take cover.
[108:19.57]Take... Yep.
[108:20.61]Okay, we fooled it.
[108:21.51]We fooled it.
[108:25.13]We fooled it.
[108:29.57]Get down there.
[108:30.19]What the fuck?
[108:30.77]How did you do that?
[108:31.50]You lifted it from the very bottom.
[108:33.60]Well, now his body's just hanging.
[108:34.88]Oh, it's local.
[108:37.00]It's local.
[108:37.54]So everyone has a different version of my body.
[108:40.44]Bug.
[108:41.22]He's coming for you.
[108:42.82]Why isn't the turret shooting the bug?
[108:43.94]Take his body.
[108:45.12]No, we needed that.
[108:49.33]Wait, actually, no.
[108:50.21]We pieced him now.
[108:50.91]It's fine.
[108:51.77]I'm gonna be honest.
[108:52.39]I didn't even think he would actually take it.
[108:53.71]It's my body.
[108:53.99]Yeah, it's my body.
[108:54.63]I found it.
[108:55.91]I thought he would actually just take... I didn't think he would actually take bodies.
[108:58.79]I thought he... Actually... Okay.
[109:00.39]That's a dead end.
[109:00.99]You might... Yeah.
[109:02.07]We have to go that way.
[109:03.04]Wait, people are... Everyone in here is fine.
[109:07.78]No one died in this turret.
[109:08.90]Yeah.
[109:10.00]What?
[109:11.16]Rambu did.
[109:11.92]No one died to this turret yet.
[109:13.84]Buggy.
[109:14.24]Hello, Buggy.
[109:16.44]Oh, he's gonna want that.
[109:17.76]He's gonna want that.
[109:19.06]Yeah, but I had to assume I don't want somebody to run into danger.
[109:23.00]He does love the body.
[109:25.18]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, my bad.
[109:29.08]Goodbye.
[109:35.50]What is that thing?
[109:36.10]What do I do with that?
[109:37.42]What do I do?
[109:37.88]Scan it.
[109:38.16]What do we do with it?
[109:39.38]Scan it.
[109:42.42]I can't scan it.
[109:43.48]I can't scan that thing.
[109:46.61]Get away from me!
[109:47.41]Okay, okay, okay.
[109:48.47]Okay, my bad.
[109:49.67]Okay, you can take it.
[109:50.37]No, he's taking it back.
[109:51.27]What does that thing do?
[109:52.24]No, no, no, no, no.
[109:53.70]This thing.
[109:54.06]So, wait.
[109:54.78]So, I have to look at it.
[109:56.14]It's like Peanut.
[109:56.64]It's like the Peanut SCP.
[109:58.40]Okay.
[110:12.30]I'm looking at it.
[110:13.54]Listen, I'll just stare at it and you guys can go grab it.
[110:16.40]Not a problem.
[110:18.44]I'll volunteer to stare at it if you guys want to just... He wants the bell.
[110:24.75]Stop giving him the bell!
[110:25.97]Where's the bell?
[110:27.33]No, up on the outside.
[110:28.79]Don't hold loot if you don't have to.
[110:30.53]Watch out with that machine gun!
[110:32.01]This level is bad.
[110:32.91]Alright, I'm going around.
[110:46.59]What?
[110:47.07]Poke, you alright?
[110:48.57]Poke?
[110:50.25]Poke?
[110:52.10]Poke, where are you?
[110:53.50]Poke, you okay?
[110:54.08]Are you down?
[110:55.88]Oh my god.
[110:59.08]Why are there so many bugs here?
[111:09.01]No, you can't have that!
[111:10.21]You can't!
[111:11.71]What just blew into this?
[111:13.90]This level is such awful!
[111:14.70]Is this thing moving?
[111:15.44]We gotta...
[111:36.98]I'll look at the coil head.
[111:40.76]I'll make sure I'm staring at it.
[111:41.54]You got it?
[111:41.78]Is poke dead?
[112:03.40]There's three or two bodies.
[112:04.80]I don't know.
[112:05.18]It doesn't have to be worth anything.
[112:06.34]There's two more.
[112:08.36]We don't have any money left anyway, do we?
[112:10.66]Oh, Etalyx, you can come out.
[112:12.84]You're good.
[112:13.36]As long as... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[112:16.66]It's alright.
[112:17.70]The one that's outside?
[112:18.58]Is it going to get me if I walk by it?
[112:21.26]No, no.
[112:21.58]You're good.
[112:21.84]You're good.
[112:22.16]As long... Etalyx, come on out.
[112:23.80]You're good.
[112:24.40]I promise.
[112:24.76]Come here.
[112:25.08]Come here.
[112:25.38]Take this rubber ducky.
[112:27.58]Oh, my God.
[112:30.98]Rubber ducky?
[112:32.50]Take my ducky to safety.
[112:35.22]Oh, run.
[112:35.64]You didn't go outside.
[112:37.06]Oh.
[112:38.34]What just happened?
[112:40.32]Uh, explosion.
[112:41.38]That's it.
[112:42.48]Metallic stepped on a mine?
[112:43.58]Oh, God.
[112:44.60]Get away from me.
[112:47.56]Get away.
[112:50.36]This bug is up here.
[112:51.98]Is there a second coil head?
[112:53.14]Are you kidding me?
[112:54.28]Wait, there's a second one?
[112:55.32]No, there's not.
[112:58.18]Get the fuck away from me.
[112:59.53]What's the kick button?
[113:05.56]The machine gun is going to shoot me.
[113:08.20]Alright, I'm going, I'm going.
[113:10.86]Alright, I got to get the duck home.
[113:17.72]Oh God.
[113:19.34]I don't even know what direction to go.
[113:29.53]It's this way, right?
[114:56.27]Do I leave?
[115:00.47]Do I go?
[115:03.51]Shut up, shut up, shut up.
[115:05.13]There's a dog.
[115:19.82]OK, listen, I'm on the roof.
[115:30.95]Dude, the bar filled up all the way.
[115:39.57]It was, I think it was Ross was talking to me.
[115:47.54]Who's a good boy?
[115:48.10]I was going to just leave.
[115:50.20]That's right.
[115:51.32]It's you.
[115:51.78]Come on.
[115:53.72]Apparently Sneak is lagging, but he's actually just holding down all of the enemies in the area.
[116:01.43]So he's lagged out, but he's controlling the environment.
[116:04.93]Controlling the environment?
[116:06.37]Yeah, these can't move if somebody looks at them.
[116:10.01]Vote?
[116:31.51]Yeah, vote.
[116:32.21]Oh, it's already gonna leave.
[116:37.49]Damn.
[116:40.13]That was fun.
[116:43.51]Well, I guess we don't have enough to, uh, meet quota.
[116:46.91]Aww.
[116:48.46]This was kind of a wacky one, though.
[116:51.46]That was pretty good.
[117:03.52]Sneak lives here now.
[117:06.98]This will be the rest of his life.
[117:08.82]Yeah.
[117:13.26]Did they attack or go to kill anybody if they're just in it?
[117:17.10]How does it work?
[117:17.90]No.
[117:18.94]If you're just making the day there, if you're looking now.
[117:21.58]Yeah, if you look away, they snap your neck.
[117:23.75]Apparently he's placing on his strange.
[117:25.59]Said I got got.
[117:29.03]Good comfort, Ross.
[117:34.32]So does Ross think that you're still alive, Ster?
[117:35.94]No, I don't know what he thinks.
[117:39.82]I feel like he's trying to get himself killed.
[117:42.42]I'm sorry.
[117:43.40]I'm saying he's doing a bit.
[117:47.61]I think he thinks people are alive.
[117:52.13]He's staying quiet for everyone else, I think, too.
[117:55.01]Yeah, I think he thinks people are alive.
[117:59.30]It's completely dark in there now.
[118:00.88]Yeah, the lights are totally dark.
[118:02.48]What the hell?
[118:05.84]That's scary.
[118:07.58]I don't like this.
[118:09.18]Sneak left the house, but his stream shows he's on the ship.
[118:12.71]What?
[118:13.37]That's what one of my chat members said.
[118:15.63]What?
[118:16.49]Okay, that's weird.
[118:17.81]They're currently moaning Sneak.
[118:24.48]Are we stuck here?
[118:26.66]We might have to leave the game.
[118:27.62]Yeah, there might have been a desync.
[118:31.58]Hello?
[118:32.78]Probably.
[118:33.77]What the hell?
[118:34.89]Yeah, people were saying Sneak was lagging.
[118:37.01]Just kind of in the void.
[118:40.68]Did I die?
[118:41.88]What's happening?
[118:43.24]I don't know why it doesn't reset.
[118:44.54]Sneak set it desynced in Discord.
[118:46.18]Yeah.
[118:47.08]Yeah, I think he's got to drop it from the game and rejoin.
[118:51.63]So do we need to make a new lobby or is him just dropping?
[118:55.83]He'll be able to rejoin, I think.
[118:57.41]Okay.
[119:00.43]Hey, there it is.
[119:01.59]Oh, okay.
[119:01.89]There we go.
[119:02.85]He said to leave.
[119:06.83]He said he lives.
[119:10.34]He's got it.
[119:10.76]Good job.
[119:12.30]Alright.
[119:12.86]That was a really hard one, though.
[119:15.20]That was tough.
[119:19.48]I don't think we- that painting's worth a lot, but I don't think we have- we have 322.
[119:22.62]We need 372.
[119:22.92]God damn it.
[119:23.22]Wait, it's only 50.
[119:24.22]Oh, 383!
[119:24.34]I see you guys, I see 383.
[119:25.18]I think we're okay, I think we're okay.
[119:27.30]Hold on, let me put this stuff over here.
[119:34.95]Hello?
[119:35.97]Yeah, that was weird.
[119:38.87]There we go.
[119:39.93]We talked about staring at those two forever.
[119:42.59]No, I left.
[119:45.55]Yeah, you were just sitting there staring at them.
[119:46.95]I literally jumped down and got out of the doorway and came back to the ship and you were just looking around wondering what to do.
[119:54.01]And then you said, I'm sorry, Sneak, and left.
[119:56.15]And I was like, I'm literally right next to you.
[119:58.70]Oh my god, in my game?
[120:00.42]You were still in the mansion staring at the coil guy.
[120:04.52]Come get the painting excuse me Is it who buys this actually who's back here you'll see that was so weird Holy shit
[120:28.18]I guess it has something to do with the lobby increase.
[120:31.14]I guess I didn't make it outside of the mansion.
[120:33.88]I think it happens sometimes.
[120:34.86]We're good.
[120:36.36]No, it's not too bad.
[120:37.24]We're okay.
[120:37.98]We're okay.
[120:38.86]Is this stuff still open?
[120:39.62]Back up, back up, back up.
[120:41.04]380.
[120:41.66]That painting was worth a lot.
[120:42.62]Holy shit.
[120:42.96]That was worth a lot of money.
[120:57.40]I'm gonna buy a toilet.
[121:01.32]Oh my god, he's holding Criken.
[121:02.66]Look at him, he's holding Criken.
[121:05.44]So now we can go to one of the super duper hard ones, right?
[121:08.67]Exactly.
[121:10.17]Is that the super duper hard one?
[121:11.87]I don't know if we have a lot of money.
[121:12.85]Now we didn't have enough money, but I did buy a teleporter.
[121:17.53]Oh, excellent.
[121:18.31]A teleporter?
[121:19.57]Can we get a teleporter?
[121:22.21]Oh, there's a really nice.
[121:23.05]Oh, a teleporter.
[121:24.44]Can we get some walkie-talkies?
[121:25.66]I think we're out of them.
[121:26.40]We have $5.
[121:26.92]We need... We need... I want to... Oh.
[121:28.36]We probably have... Let's see.
[121:31.36]Let's go to the dollar store.
[121:33.58]Surely a... A toilet's five bucks, right?
[121:37.42]No toilet.
[121:39.46]You can sell a body for five.
[121:41.22]The toilets aren't available guys.
[121:42.60]Sorry.
[121:43.22]Sorry to disappoint.
[121:43.94]Don't do it.
[121:44.36]Don't do it.
[121:45.28]I'm not doing anything.
[121:46.16]I'm good.
[121:47.48]I'm chilling.
[121:49.59]I'm chilling.
[121:50.71]It's like the green.
[121:51.39]It's like the green gauntlet.
[121:55.23]Where are you taking us?
[121:56.59]Taking us somewhere?
[121:57.31]Where are we going?
[122:04.12]I can check.
[122:05.66]Did someone raid me, chat?
[122:07.42]Just a minute ago?
[122:08.38]Alex, get off the computer.
[122:09.54]Yeah, it was simply... We have to share this computer.
[122:15.57]Yeah, I know.
[122:16.25]It's like 1990.
[122:17.21]It's like 1 to 3 in the living room.
[122:20.35]Don't pick the phone up.
[122:22.41]If you pick the phone up, you'll kill the whole connection.
[122:27.53]I just want one that's normal, honestly.
[122:29.46]Simply flippable.
[122:31.09]Yeah, I'll take it.
[122:32.23]I'll take a simple one.
[122:34.25]Yeah, but I can point too.
[122:35.39]I'm just gonna sit here.
[122:36.85]I don't think any of these are normal.
[122:40.87]Put a cut off.
[122:44.55]Jeremy, you should be the imposter and kill everyone next round.
[122:46.95]Do a flip.
[122:47.57]Do a flip.
[122:48.05]Do a flip.
[122:48.53]Ban that person for an hour.
[122:52.07]That cut off at the exact right moment.
[122:54.80]They're actually like an imposter.
[122:56.76]Wait, what?
[122:58.10]The big pit?
[122:58.70]That?
[122:59.06]Watch out for that.
[123:01.02]Goodbye, Vinny.
[123:03.38]Goodbye, Vinny.
[123:04.14]Goodbye, Vinny.
[123:05.63]Oh, no.
[123:07.19]Yep, he's in there.
[123:07.91]He goes down.
[123:08.93]Yep, he's in there.
[123:09.87]Oh, no.
[123:10.19]Vinny.
[123:10.41]He just said watch out for the pit.
[123:12.59]Nope, he's in there.
[123:13.89]He jumped in the pit?
[123:15.99]Oh, yeah.
[123:16.35]He jumped in?
[123:18.66]Yep.
[123:18.90]I watched him go into the drink.
[123:21.08]It goes down.
[123:22.48]Luigi was a little thirsty.
[123:23.88]Uh huh.
[123:26.70]The good news is we have a teleporter so we can just teleport his body back on the ship and avoid fines.
[123:32.72]Wait, really?
[123:33.24]Yeah.
[123:34.42]That's the benefit of the teleporter.
[123:35.98]Besides like getting people out.
[123:37.54]But when you teleport somebody out they drop all... This seems like a safer design.
[123:48.79]Uh... What?
[123:49.29]Okay.
[123:49.59]If I make it over the mine and make it back what do I get?
[123:52.55]Wow.
[123:54.93]I'll give you a little dance.
[123:56.13]I'll give you a little dance.
[123:57.47]Alright.
[123:58.85]Is it easy?
[123:59.79]It's easy.
[124:01.25]It's easy.
[124:02.25]I hit my head on the banister.
[124:05.53]I hit my head on the fucking banister.
[124:12.64]That was not supposed to actually happen.
[124:14.98]That was not supposed to actually happen.
[124:17.32]I hit collision on the... No, it was easy.
[124:22.34]I just hit... I had collision with my head on the ceiling and it stopped me and made me fucking step on it.
[124:39.54]oh my god did you die from that explosion what's going on down here dude oh no you fell off I was doing a Skibidi bit
[125:06.95]You died just as I did my Skibidi bit.
[125:11.41]Oh my god.
[125:13.11]How come Poke didn't hit his head on the ceiling?
[125:17.15]I hit my head on like a rafter and it froze me and then I... I got him.
[125:35.76]Because poke is good.
[125:36.82]Poke is built different.
[125:38.18]Giving poke a horn is like giving a child a... I need to ask him.
[125:44.75]I gotta ask poke, how did I mess that up so bad?
[125:47.59]I just looked like you missed just barely on my screen.
[125:55.41]I want to look at the clip from my end, because one of those, like, banister things was hanging low, and I just jumped into it and got kind of stuck.
[126:05.37]They're getting stuck in a fucking corner, though.
[126:08.52]But, like, they're actually getting past the turret because of it.
[126:11.24]I want to see this.
[126:12.46]I want to see what the fuck happened.
[126:22.29]If I make it over the... Let's find out.
[126:33.78]Oh, it's total fucking chaos.
[126:35.02]I don't even know if we should.
[126:36.22]Maybe if we're funny.
[126:36.76]I'm definitely having fun doing this.
[126:38.08]I can see why if you get more than six or seven, it's just total lunacy.
[127:03.26]Alright, let me see what the fuck happened here.
[127:06.12]It's either a Bracken or a Hoarder.
[127:10.18]I admit, that might be a Bracken.
[127:12.41]Well, how did you die?
[127:14.41]I don't know what happened.
[127:16.43]Oh.
[127:16.51]Okay, uh... How did you guys die?
[127:24.29]When did you die?
[127:26.90]I need to see what the fuck happened here.
[127:29.66]I heard about that.
[127:30.51]Okay, if I make it over the mine and make it back, what do I get?
[127:35.51]You gotta stop touching the mines.
[127:39.75]What the hell?
[127:41.53]What happened to me?
[127:42.87]Is it easy?
[127:43.71]It's easy.
[127:47.53]See, that's fucking bullshit.
[127:49.14]That's fucking bullshit.
[127:50.22]Look at the stupid shit around this turret.
[127:52.54]Oh my god.
[127:57.16]Kapok is still making loud noises.
[128:05.39]I jumped too soon.
[128:09.27]Polluting his body with Panda Express and then blowing his horn.
[128:13.25]I jumped over it?
[128:14.21]Because Kapok jumped earlier, that's why.
[128:16.74]Oh.
[128:17.56]But I didn't know the thing was on the ceiling.
[128:24.50]Oh.
[128:26.87]You turned.
[128:27.40]Someone said you turned around and stepped on it.
[128:32.30]I was fine.
[128:33.02]Oh God.
[128:38.12]Oak hit the beam as well, but he landed to the right of the mine, so he missed it.
[128:42.35]Oh, that's fine.
[128:42.87]Oh my God, there he goes.
[128:45.71]Okay, well, that's not good.
[128:48.71]I'll be right back.
[128:50.34]Oh, they're dead.
[128:52.12]Well.
[128:53.13]It was a nice try.
[128:53.87]It was good.
[128:54.71]It was a good attempt.
[128:55.67]I don't know how to get home.
[129:02.03]Maybe this way?
[129:02.93]Oh no.
[129:04.12]Poki has an air horn.
[129:07.80]No!
[129:07.92]Is that landmines?
[129:16.78]Oh shit.
[129:17.26]Let me turn this back up.
[129:18.76]You found the thing that killed me.
[129:21.78]Oh my god.
[129:28.05]My god, man What happened a lot of things there was Guys you put that pit there, dude
[129:51.67]Poke is going to make it.
[129:53.51]Save one item.
[130:02.64]I slipped and got a boo boo guys.
[130:04.16]5 bucks.
[130:10.66]Yeah, you're welcome.
[130:13.37]Oh, Ster.
[130:14.04]What's Ster doing?
[130:16.00]Oh, he's teleporting.
[130:17.24]Yeah, you can teleport the bodies so we don't get fined.
[130:21.28]Oh, that's cool.
[130:23.32]You can also teleport people like regularly, but they drop everything they have.
[130:26.80]So it's like a kind of a... I don't know.
[130:29.51]It's kind of no point because you can just teleport a body and they have nothing anywhere.
[130:34.19]Oh my god.
[130:35.43]Oh, hey.
[130:37.79]Are they chasing you?
[130:38.41]They're all dead.
[130:40.97]Look what I got.
[130:45.43]Oh, what the fuck?
[130:50.63]Are you cloning bodies?
[130:54.09]Cloning.
[130:58.02]Cloning machine.
[131:00.02]Maybe the next guy's alive.
[131:07.25]Man, I could have used one of these teleports, like, way earlier.
[131:10.07]Well, if they didn't know before, they know now.
[131:11.33]The horror in his voice.
[131:12.17]Oh, God.
[131:12.77]What the fuck is the blood trail doing?
[131:15.25]Guys, who's bleeding?
[131:37.34]Clearly somebody had to still be alive.
[131:39.22]Grow up, dude.
[131:40.68]Oh my god.
[131:46.38]Oh, cool.
[131:49.70]Paranoid and injured.
[131:53.16]Wait, that air horn sounds weird.
[131:56.76]Paranoid and injury.
[131:58.16]We got stuff to make. $400.
[132:08.90]We're going to do a foggy level because I've made a discovery.
[132:16.17]It's the same map, but foggy.
[132:19.21]I think the air horn is based off of where you're holding it.
[132:24.49]Yeah, if you spin.
[132:25.99]Oh, I see what you mean.
[132:26.87]No, no, no.
[132:30.70]Like, look, I'll go up.
[132:32.04]I'll go up.
[132:34.10]Oh.
[132:35.80]Or I'll go down.
[132:36.40]There's gonna be a little foggy, but you know, yeah.
[132:38.54]Are there any flashlights?
[132:39.56]Nah, I don't mind.
[132:41.01]I just did it way too much in a row.
[132:42.67]That was so weird.
[132:44.05]Where's our illuminator?
[132:48.73]That thing's supposed to run out of air.
[132:50.29]Let me see that for a sec.
[132:53.31]Sound emoji.
[132:54.13]He has zero XP.
[132:55.69]Am I supposed to have XP?
[132:56.87]I'm trying to throw it off the ship.
[133:02.36]Wait, what are you doing?
[133:03.54]I can hold it.
[133:04.04]I'll hold it.
[133:06.89]It's this way.
[133:08.93]Wow.
[133:09.99]It's really foggy.
[133:12.21]You good?
[133:13.49]Yeah, I have no idea.
[133:14.05]Follow Alex.
[133:16.88]I'm the wrong choice.
[133:19.72]Oh, wait.
[133:20.38]I don't... I'm... Can you guys wait?
[133:23.24]I don't know... Oh, there you are.
[133:24.32]Wait, there's Jared.
[133:25.04]Here he is.
[133:26.02]Okay.
[133:26.78]There's three of us.
[133:27.38]Is this the pit level?
[133:29.98]That might be a pit.
[133:31.36]I played this game for about four hours a week and a half ago.
[133:36.08]I should know some of these things, but I just don't.
[133:38.16]Four hours?
[133:39.59]That should make you an expert.
[133:41.47]Good luck to us, though.
[133:42.53]Zero XP.
[133:43.39]I mean, that's not a lot.
[133:48.89]I've been playing for like an hour now.
[133:50.79]I don't know what I'm doing.
[133:52.11]I saw the edge of the pit until this second.
[133:55.00]I had about 200 in my first two or three hours.
[133:58.14]Well, you had 200 XP?
[133:58.72]I did.
[133:58.90]How close do you have to get to the thing to scan it?
[134:05.41]I'm just kidding.
[134:06.87]Connor, I have no idea what I'm talking about.
[134:08.19]You lied.
[134:09.93]Why are you guys following me?
[134:11.63]I don't think I have any experience.
[134:13.37]I thought we established we were going together.
[134:16.83]Hold on, hold on.
[134:17.58]It's okay.
[134:18.66]I prepared for potentially getting lost.
[134:21.00]We will simply find the others.
[134:24.49]We just have to wait for them to hear us.
[134:26.45]I put that down.
[134:29.62]You're going to get the monsters to show up.
[134:35.76]Someone will show up.
[134:38.08]Let's just keep going this way.
[134:40.40]This looks like it's going downwards.
[134:41.87]That could be a hole.
[134:47.43]Where's the edge of the map in this?
[134:48.79]I don't know.
[134:53.95]Ross was still on the ship.
[134:56.99]Maybe Ross will know.
[134:59.41]Ross!
[135:00.37]Can you hear us?
[135:02.19]Ross!
[135:06.47]Do we have infrared goggles we can put on?
[135:09.39]No.
[135:10.91]We should have stayed with the group.
[135:12.35]I thought this was the group.
[135:15.89]Hey!
[135:17.75]Main entrance, but this is a cliff.
[135:19.99]You were following me, now I'm following you.
[135:21.95]Hey, the main entrance is over here, but I think this is a cliff.
[135:24.95]Be careful.
[135:26.27]Oh, main entrance.
[135:28.21]I think you can walk off that.
[135:29.09]Oh, that does look like a cliff, yeah.
[135:30.69]That looks like a cliff.
[135:32.99]Maybe this way.
[135:33.75]There's like some shrubbery here.
[135:41.40]I think we're alright.
[135:43.88]Seems like a pretty good marker.
[135:45.02]Yeah, we're on the right track.
[135:49.99]Into the void.
[135:55.23]Oh yeah, this seems right.
[135:58.65]Okay, alright, we found it.
[136:00.07]Good job.
[136:00.43]Nice.
[136:02.89]Oh my god, there's a body.
[136:04.61]Oh, they're already dead.
[136:07.70]Oh no.
[136:11.84]Not Vinny.
[136:13.28]Not Vinny.
[136:15.86]Uh, anybody left in here?
[136:17.12]Is anybody alive?
[136:18.08]Hello?
[136:22.59]The turret's right!
[136:23.23]The turret's right!
[136:27.50]Alright, I get out of here Oh
[136:52.73]What?
[136:54.29]Did it kill him?
[136:56.97]How did it shoot through the wall?
[137:00.21]There's a machine gun.
[137:01.91]Hey, sorry.
[137:03.16]We just got... Still alive, by the way.
[137:07.24]My voice just cut off.
[137:08.16]Still alive.
[137:24.39]Ryken's over there.
[137:26.73]We just got here.
[137:27.69]There's a lot of turrets.
[137:33.65]Is there a lot of turrets?
[137:35.94]All over the place.
[137:38.18]Alright, this body is lost.
[137:42.62]Oh my god.
[137:42.90]Hi.
[137:44.60]Alex, be careful.
[137:48.10]Alright, now what?
[137:48.68]There's a spider.
[137:51.36]A spider.
[137:54.40]Spider.
[137:57.48]There he is.
[138:01.62]Machine gun.
[138:02.50]I hear feet.
[138:04.16]Feet.
[138:05.74]I hear feet.
[138:07.35]Current.
[138:07.95]Mid.
[138:09.73]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[138:11.01]What do we do?
[138:11.45]What do we do?
[138:11.75]What do we do about it?
[138:13.17]We go around.
[138:13.61]We go around.
[138:14.37]It's not on.
[138:14.95]Why is it off?
[138:15.35]Uh, I think it's facing the wrong way.
[138:21.39]Oh, yep, yep, yep.
[138:22.15]Oh, turn it.
[138:23.02]Spider behind over here.
[138:25.14]Concentrating?
[138:25.74]Back this way.
[138:28.58]That way.
[138:28.94]Is it mine?
[138:32.03]Where the hell are you guys?
[138:32.79]Where'd you guys go?
[138:36.19]I'm right on the other side of the turret hallway.
[138:38.83]We're separated.
[138:40.79]I'm on the other end of the turret hallway.
[138:44.67]Where's the mine?
[138:45.27]Oh, there's the mine.
[138:50.25]You come to where I am.
[138:52.52]How did you guys get over there without triggering the turret?
[138:55.36]If you crouch walk, you're fine.
[138:59.36]Just don't step on it.
[139:00.78]Want me to come get you?
[139:06.19]Alright.
[139:08.19]This thing is active.
[139:09.77]It's active.
[139:10.17]Should I run to the left?
[139:12.85]Alex is dead?
[139:13.51]He just ran into the room and jumped into the void instantly.
[139:20.99]What?
[139:25.82]How do I get to where you are?
[139:31.80]I can't see anything.
[139:33.06]I'm coming to you.
[139:37.10]Hi.
[139:37.48]Okay, hi.
[139:38.68]Alright, ready?
[139:39.86]Ready, go.
[139:44.10]Alright, I thought I just ran in here and jumped.
[139:46.54]Oh, yeah, I've done that before.
[139:48.26]Okay, I'm going to find a way out.
[139:55.27]Did you see anyone when you came in?
[140:00.56]Did you see what was it?
[140:02.46]Did you see anyone when you came in?
[140:04.54]No.
[140:05.42]Well, Rambo is still alive.
[140:07.10]I don't know where Rambo is though.
[140:11.10]I think Sneak was alive at one point.
[140:13.44]We got here really late.
[140:15.70]Got some bottles.
[140:16.74]I'll take that.
[140:19.91]Room.
[140:25.66]Empty room?
[140:29.56]Oh, what is that?
[140:30.26]Oh, hell yeah.
[140:32.61]What is it?
[140:37.13]Ooh, okay.
[140:39.85]Oh, we gotta get back up.
[140:42.07]We gotta crouch.
[140:44.91]So you can walk over it if you crouch?
[140:47.51]Not over it, but around it, yeah.
[140:51.63]God, I hate those things.
[140:54.52]Yeah, we don't want to go in there.
[140:55.86]It's OK.
[141:03.11]I don't forget about the turrets because there are going to be a problem.
[141:05.99]Yeah.
[141:07.75]Oh, I'm so slow now.
[141:16.73]Wait, is Vinny still alive?
[141:21.14]I don't know.
[141:21.60]Someone's in the ship right now because they're teleporting things.
[141:24.42]So that's good.
[141:25.29]But... What was that?
[141:29.49]It's a thumper.
[141:31.95]What does that mean?
[141:34.19]Jesus Christ!
[141:35.54]Go, go, go, go!
[141:36.96]Go where?
[141:38.56]This way!
[141:39.08]Careful!
[141:40.16]Wait!
[141:40.36]You're getting teleported!
[141:42.36]You're free!
[141:44.77]Okay, you are about to die, I just saw, I teleported you out.
[141:48.77]Criken's still alive, he's still in there.
[141:50.11]Save him!
[141:50.63]You gonna get him out of there?
[141:52.47]Okay, uh... Oh, okay, hold on, we gotta cool down, just wait.
[141:58.83]He's not still alive.
[141:59.63]He's not in danger, he's not in danger.
[142:02.33]He's looking dead to me.
[142:04.64]Wait, you don't get to teleport with stuff?
[142:06.88]I had stuff in my hand.
[142:08.08]No, yeah, you lose the stuff, but it will lose money if you die, so...
[142:13.99]But we can get, if Criken can get out.
[142:15.65]Wait, we're stopping Criken?
[142:20.17]Wait, what, who's that?
[142:21.31]This is Criken.
[142:22.61]Oh, that's Criken.
[142:24.59]I'm sorry, Criken.
[142:26.05]You did really good.
[142:27.18]You were very helpful.
[142:28.96]Let's just check.
[142:29.80]Okay, so we still have Ranboo just kind of standing in a corner.
[142:33.02]He could be dead, but he doesn't have anything.
[142:34.96]So let's just summon him.
[142:35.48]That is what being dead looks like.
[142:37.45]Yeah, but normally it's like a darker blue, right?
[142:40.19]Like the beat signature?
[142:42.29]Now, you know, I take that back.
[142:43.95]Yeah, he's dead.
[142:44.87]Yeah, okay, he's dead.
[142:46.55]Uh, let's just check.
[142:47.39]Okay, roll call.
[142:48.25]Criken.
[142:49.57]Uh, uh, Jerma.
[142:51.67]Uh, Nopal.
[142:52.57]Present.
[142:53.05]Uh, Connor.
[142:54.08]Okay, Vinesauce.
[142:55.48]Vinny.
[142:56.50]Poke.
[142:57.08]It's already.
[142:57.60]Robert Ross.
[142:58.14]That's me.
[142:58.70]Sneak.
[142:59.10]Whoever you can.
[142:59.74]Ster.
[143:02.18]Yeah, no, guys.
[143:03.12]Everyone's on the.
[143:04.28]Wait, actually, hold on.
[143:04.84]You know what?
[143:05.12]There is actually one more person.
[143:09.40]Okay, I think that's everyone.
[143:10.86]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[143:14.60]Okay, let's just check.
[143:18.68]Wow, we actually recovered every single body.
[143:20.55]Honestly, shocking you made it out alive.
[143:26.01]Aye, me too.
[143:26.81]Yeah, we're sorry about that.
[143:28.41]Yeah, sorry you lost your stuff.
[143:32.33]No, you absolutely should have.
[143:35.27]There's no way I was making it up.
[143:42.06]44 bucks.
[143:44.26]Oh my goodness.
[143:47.19]We have 108 total of items, so we can do it.
[143:51.93]We got this.
[143:52.28]Organize.
[143:52.72]I'm feeling good about this. $400.
[144:00.21]We can do it.
[144:00.99]Let's do it.
[144:01.97]We can do it.
[144:02.53]We can do it.
[144:03.77]Honestly, if we had a walkie-talkie, this would have been so much easier managing the teleporter.
[144:09.69]A flashlight?
[144:10.69]Do we have a flashlight?
[144:12.50]We don't have any money at all.
[144:15.08]We have $4.
[144:15.38]We have $4.
[144:16.82]Dave Ross, what does the red button do?
[144:19.52]It's the teleporter.
[144:20.48]The red button is the teleporter.
[144:22.18]I can see it.
[144:25.03]Are you asking us streamers to budget?
[144:29.31]No, we're good.
[144:29.71]We're okay.
[144:31.21]I cannot budget.
[144:32.34]I have to order on Uber Eats three times today.
[144:34.88]Alright.
[144:37.02]Where are we heading?
[144:41.26]I say we implement the buddy system.
[144:44.57]Buddy system.
[144:44.99]Alright.
[144:45.91]We can all do like HelloFresh sponsorships if we need to make up the rest.
[144:49.47]Snake, you want to be my buddy?
[144:51.67]I don't know, you don't have a costume on.
[144:53.19]I only do man-grains.
[144:54.65]Is Audible not cool anymore?
[144:56.07]You don't have a costume on.
[144:58.57]Oh, now we're talking, baby.
[145:02.19]Let's get it.
[145:04.51]Go, go, go, go, go.
[145:08.25]Which one's that?
[145:09.51]Isn't that like Manscaped?
[145:10.79]That's the one, thank you.
[145:12.07]Yeah, no problem.
[145:15.27]Dollar ball club.
[145:19.91]Hi.
[145:21.37]Hey.
[145:23.83]How you feeling?
[145:25.11]I'm feeling good.
[145:25.85]How do you feel?
[145:28.63]I just had some Panda, so I'm great.
[145:30.77]Ooh, nice.
[145:33.43]I'm going to follow you.
[145:35.49]Alright.
[145:37.15]I feel like you're a good gamer.
[145:39.85]I'll go this way.
[145:49.81]Okay.
[145:54.26]We are both alive.
[145:55.70]The turret is through this.
[145:56.88]I'm going out.
[145:59.26]No, no, no, no.
[146:00.10]That's a turret.
[146:00.54]Turret, turret, turret.
[146:01.28]Turret in there.
[146:01.84]Turret.
[146:06.57]Oh, no.
[146:07.29]That happened to me last time.
[146:12.84]We lost one.
[146:14.42]That's not good.
[146:17.02]That's not a good sound.
[146:18.74]Poke, you alright?
[146:27.31]Hello?
[146:38.30]Oh my god, he's okay.
[146:40.22]Oh wait, I found the locked door.
[146:41.70]Didn't Vinny say the key?
[146:42.72]Wait, maybe that's the wrong kind of door.
[146:48.44]Okay, engine collected.
[146:50.10]Wait, it says turret right here.
[146:58.68]I'm fine, I'm alive, I'm alive.
[147:00.59]I'm okay.
[147:01.31]Okay, I'm next to it, I see it.
[147:03.21]Can I like turn it off?
[147:11.54]It's... I don't... This is a bad idea.
[147:14.24]It's just looking down this hall.
[147:19.04]It's like right here.
[147:19.94]It's like... Oh!
[147:21.80]Jeez.
[147:22.72]Yeah, see?
[147:23.38]See, I found it.
[147:26.20]Turn it off?
[147:27.09]Sprint past it.
[147:29.39]I don't think we can sprint past that.
[147:33.17]What the fuck was that?
[147:35.45]The door just closed on you.
[147:42.12]What are you... Is somebody controlling the controls?
[147:48.28]Why did that shoot at me when I was all the way over there?
[147:51.30]I don't... There's one here, but I don't... Oh my... Okay, we gotta go find the group.
[147:59.39]Uh, there are a lot of turrets.
[148:02.55]I see.
[148:03.41]What's going on in here?
[148:07.61]There's some turrets in here.
[148:10.65]Turrets everywhere.
[148:13.75]That doesn't sound safe.
[148:15.91]We need a flashlight.
[148:19.59]In one of these directions.
[148:21.01]In this hallway.
[148:22.22]I don't like this building.
[148:25.36]I don't like this building at all.
[148:33.02]Oh, okay.
[148:34.54]Engine.
[148:35.10]Oh, I hear someone.
[148:38.45]Hello?
[148:39.05]It's me and... Who's speaking?
[148:41.70]It's Jerma.
[148:42.12]Jerma's up here.
[148:43.30]Oh, hey.
[148:44.54]There's stuff up here?
[148:45.32]Okay.
[148:46.08]I got an engine.
[148:48.53]Hello.
[148:48.65]I thought there was a dead end over here.
[148:51.73]There's like a bunch of turrets back there.
[148:53.07]Oh, I'm a dumbass.
[148:53.73]I thought there was a dead end here.
[148:56.01]There isn't.
[148:56.41]There are a lot of turrets.
[148:57.55]There's like at least two.
[148:58.21]There is eventually if you just walk far enough.
[149:00.78]Is there a locked door?
[149:02.70]Because I have a key.
[149:05.62]Maybe.
[149:06.36]I thought I saw one, but I could have been wrong.
[149:08.50]Tread very carefully.
[149:09.40]This is where they are.
[149:11.31]Okay.
[149:17.23]Careful.
[149:17.73]This is the one we couldn't get past.
[149:26.23]Someone shut it down, so someone's keeping an eye on us.
[149:29.23]It's shut.
[149:30.77]It's shut.
[149:31.69]Okay.
[149:31.92]Come on.
[149:32.60]Go, go, go.
[149:33.52]No need.
[149:34.10]Just a loop.
[149:34.54]It's a loop.
[149:34.88]It's a loop.
[149:35.48]It's just a loop.
[149:36.24]It's a loop?
[149:38.26]Yeah.
[149:40.95]Well, it shuts down again.
[149:41.87]I'll try to go.
[149:42.48]There's two turrets down here, by the way.
[149:45.10]We just walked in a fucking circle.
[149:53.30]Bad.
[149:53.82]Bad.
[149:58.52]Yeah, all of this is bad.
[149:59.70]No, no, no, no, no.
[150:00.60]No, never.
[150:01.20]Never that way.
[150:01.86]Ever.
[150:03.62]Okay.
[150:04.25]Well, this is a fail corner.
[150:05.45]We don't want to be here.
[150:07.53]I do have... This time we go back if we want to just leave.
[150:10.07]Yeah, I want to bring this back.
[150:11.53]I want to make sure we bring something back.
[150:13.71]Yeah, you've got stuff.
[150:14.87]I do have stuff.
[150:18.70]I might just go back.
[150:19.40]I'm going to head back.
[150:24.10]You okay?
[150:25.32]I can take it back if you want.
[150:27.36]Do you know how to get back to the ship?
[150:32.95]Hey, do you know how to get back to the ship?
[150:34.95]Yeah, it's like you just go around the hole.
[150:37.07]Yeah, that's good because I have no idea.
[150:38.47]Good luck.
[150:39.85]Alright.
[150:40.49]Oh, see ya.
[150:40.69]I should come with you.
[150:45.39]There's a ship over there.
[150:46.26]I know what I'm doing.
[150:49.02]Let's go around the hole.
[150:51.12]Those are locusts, not bees.
[150:54.56]Learned that earlier.
[150:55.32]Let's figure it out and just die if I go in there again.
[150:58.58]Yeah, no, probably.
[151:01.97]I can't figure out anything.
[151:02.97]I don't know what's going on.
[151:05.85]Ooh, we're making money.
[151:07.67]We got stuff.
[151:09.18]Someone said there's a beehive over here.
[151:10.68]Yeah, there's a beehive over there.
[151:15.38]I'm not killing the whole team again by picking up a beehive.
[151:17.54]Nope.
[151:18.82]Did you do that?
[151:20.14]Yeah.
[151:21.18]Accidentally.
[151:21.66]Nice.
[151:25.40]There's like no dogs or anything.
[151:31.12]We brought something.
[151:37.41]Brought a generator.
[151:39.55]Oh, nice.
[151:45.78]Got you, buddy.
[151:51.32]Good?
[151:53.24]It is.
[151:53.52]It's like being woken out of a nightmare.
[151:55.22]It really is.
[151:55.74]Yeah, it really is.
[151:57.08]He just doesn't say anything and walks out, looks at the sun.
[152:01.32]You go from so terrified to everything is completely normal in one second, just like from a horrible nightmare.
[152:08.64]It's a good thing we had a key.
[152:10.25]We don't have all the money yet.
[152:11.31]There's one beehive outside.
[152:12.59]We going for a beehive?
[152:14.95]I'll take it.
[152:16.95]How do you do it?
[152:17.79]It's starting to get foggy.
[152:21.38]There's a monster over there.
[152:22.34]I see it.
[152:22.82]It's right there.
[152:24.82]That is a monster.
[152:25.46]Criken is in deep trouble.
[152:36.70]Okay, can you make the jump?
[152:37.71]I got the beehive right there.
[152:39.39]Okay.
[152:42.07]Okay.
[152:43.47]I'm watching Criken because he's... Oh, there's bees.
[152:46.28]Oh, they're chasing him.
[152:47.70]Oh, they're like electric bees.
[152:50.00]Yeah, yeah.
[152:50.96]Is anybody else alive?
[152:54.38]Yeah, yeah, yeah, Criken is... Wait, hold on.
[152:56.84]Can someone stop poking the screen?
[152:58.59]I'm trying to grab the... Oh!
[153:00.07]Oh shit, I'm so sorry.
[153:01.91]Sneak is still... Oh.
[153:03.85]Criken just stopped moving.
[153:06.03]Okay, we're probably going to pull a Criken.
[153:07.47]Guys, can you frame me?
[153:10.11]Someone's trying to bring in a beehive.
[153:13.21]I'm just going to move up so we can leave with it.
[153:15.00]Is everybody dead?
[153:16.80]I'm checking, I'm checking.
[153:18.38]You guys are wasting time.
[153:19.68]It's fucking 7pm.
[153:20.78]Too bad lag.
[153:24.57]Make sure to pick up the bodies and put them down.
[153:26.66]I'm going to bring back Pogue.
[153:34.40]We are not getting the beehive.
[153:37.10]There's something outside the ship that we can grab.
[153:38.54]Is that the beehive?
[153:40.12]I think that's what it is.
[153:41.00]The triangle?
[153:42.58]We can get the beehive.
[153:43.53]Oh shit.
[153:44.25]Sneak's about to get killed.
[153:46.63]He fell.
[153:48.37]Yeah, he fell.
[153:50.29]I'm beaming him back.
[153:55.20]That's what I thought.
[153:57.12]There's a monster outside of the ship right now.
[153:59.92]It's a talk one.
[154:01.06]It's a dog talk one.
[154:02.10]Okay.
[154:03.52]Ster is about to get attacked, but he's moving slow.
[154:06.56]So I think the dog... Yeah.
[154:09.46]He's being really quiet.
[154:10.66]He's moving slow.
[154:11.41]He should be okay.
[154:12.47]He's a gamer.
[154:14.41]Yeah.
[154:14.59]I don't know what's outside the ship.
[154:15.85]It's to the front left of the ship right now.
[154:19.55]Can we see it on the back camera?
[154:22.71]Oh, I didn't see it.
[154:24.13]I didn't see it.
[154:26.66]Okay, it's kind of gone.
[154:27.40]I think we could probably get the beehive, but it won't be enough.
[154:33.38]No, that's Vinny.
[154:34.81]Alright.
[154:36.93]You okay?
[154:37.51]Good save, by the way.
[154:41.57]I think we might have to take off.
[154:42.85]62%.
[154:43.19]55%.
[154:43.27]Is that 48?
[154:43.57]45%.
[154:43.59]40%.
[154:43.61]Maybe step away from the door. 30%.
[154:56.30]20%, I think we gotta go.
[154:57.02]12, 10%.
[154:58.62]We gotta go, we gotta go, we gotta go.
[155:01.36]We gotta go, we gotta go now.
[155:02.52]We have to go, we have to go, we have to go, we have to go, go!
[155:04.14]Turn it on, turn it on!
[155:05.56]Turn it on, go!
[155:12.39]Why did we not leave?
[155:17.31]We had to go!
[155:18.15]Why didn't you just pull the lever?
[155:21.17]My fucking lord, dude.
[155:23.61]Oh my god.
[155:26.11]I was reading percentages.
[155:29.33]Why not just pull the lever?
[155:30.79]I listened to the opposite lever guy.
[155:33.49]I didn't want to press the wrong button.
[155:35.23]Oh my god.
[155:36.17]I don't know how you lived, but good job.
[155:39.05]Wait.
[155:39.63]Holy shit.
[155:40.36]You still got an O.
[155:47.49]Did anyone leave the ship or did you just all die to dogs?
[155:54.08]Well, we couldn't leave the ship.
[155:55.36]We died to dogs.
[155:56.22]We closed the door and then they were just watching the door lower in percentage as the dog was waiting for it to open and then it opened.
[156:03.46]And the dog came and ate it.
[156:05.26]And the dog was doing...
[156:11.39]I'm excited for the cold nothingness of space.
[156:15.74]Yeah, we also were just, we were talking in here.
[156:19.07]Just like hanging out.
[156:21.59]We didn't even land on the selling planet?
[156:24.40]Oh, we have.
[156:25.06]Oh, we're not on the selling planet.
[156:26.96]OK.
[156:27.20]Wait a minute.
[156:27.76]One last run, I guess.
[156:28.86]Is this the last run or is this.
[156:30.58]We're dead, though.
[156:31.48]We've already lost.
[156:32.82]We're dead.
[156:33.38]How are we?
[156:34.04]How are we here?
[156:34.88]What?
[156:35.66]Hey, what's wrong?
[156:36.64]It doesn't matter if we sell it.
[156:39.28]So what are we?
[156:40.36]How are we even?
[156:41.24]How are we even on this planet right now?
[156:45.33]Pool party?
[156:46.05]You have to- you have to- it doesn't automatically route to the lab.
[156:49.97]Pool party!
[156:50.79]Hey!
[156:51.13]Oh, bye.
[156:51.73]Hey guys, where are you going?
[156:55.23]See ya.
[156:55.67]Guys?
[156:57.16]I can't.
[156:57.38]So we just spent an extra day not being here.
[157:02.50]No, yeah, we pretty much did, yeah.
[157:07.36]Oh, hey.
[157:08.44]Hey guys.
[157:09.16]What the hell?
[157:17.32]So now what?
[157:17.96]Why'd the ship fly away?
[157:19.13]That was a very lonely pool party.
[157:21.47]Alright.
[157:46.06]Alright, maybe we should go down to four or five.
[157:49.56]Well, that happened.
[157:54.09]It's crazy.
[157:55.85]Good morning, everyone.
[157:58.13]What do you guys think?
[157:59.03]You guys want to split off into groups of four or five?
[158:01.32]As in like games or like just in this game?
[158:10.64]How many do we have?
[158:11.16]Nine?
[158:13.81]Wait, we have 10 now.
[158:15.15]Okay.
[158:15.65]We're doing fine.
[158:17.15]I'm having fun.
[158:20.70]Let's take five to a different... Let's make teams of five.
[158:25.40]You have to stay with your team.
[158:28.99]Oh, I thought you've been like, take five.
[158:31.23]Oh yeah, we lost the teleporter.
[158:32.67]Shit, right, okay.
[158:34.01]Well, no point staying here.
[158:35.39]Put your costumes back on.
[158:37.71]You're all orange and lame.
[158:39.92]Yeah, why do we... Too bad.
[158:45.42]Oh, are you like picking... Everyone has the same costume?
[158:48.40]That's a good idea.
[158:49.50]Oh, you know what?
[158:50.02]That would be a good idea.
[158:51.12]If we're splitting off into teams.
[158:53.58]Okay.
[158:53.94]Yeah, be in the same costume.
[158:56.20]Okay, so team minion and...
[159:01.66]Who wants to be on team minion?
[159:04.06]We already got two over here.
[159:04.86]Wait, do we have team captains?
[159:07.12]No.
[159:08.10]I don't know.
[159:10.84]Draft everybody.
[159:11.75]Draft everybody.
[159:12.35]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[159:13.35]Let's do it.
[159:13.91]Let's do it.
[159:14.71]Just like at recess.
[159:15.37]Alright, everybody put your orange suit back on if you're not a captain.
[159:19.49]Who has the most game time playing this?
[159:26.25]There we go.
[159:27.31]I have 30 hours.
[159:27.97]Probably Criken, yeah.
[159:29.35]Jesus, Criken, yeah.
[159:30.43]I nominate Criken as captain.
[159:32.25]Criken's captain.
[159:34.35]So who else has the most time?
[159:42.18]I have... Me?
[159:44.88]Yeah, Jerma, you got next best.
[159:46.68]Okay, I'll be a captain.
[159:49.42]Okay.
[159:51.84]Okay.
[159:52.32]What's our outfits?
[159:53.52]Choose your team outfit.
[159:54.74]Your team minion?
[159:56.75]I'm gonna be team... You know, whatever you want.
[160:00.88]Team... You should be team Criken.
[160:02.94]Team Mario.
[160:05.16]Wow.
[160:06.90]I'll be Luigi.
[160:08.42]Yeah, Mario and Luigi.
[160:10.00]That's good.
[160:11.50]That's a good sign.
[160:15.68]Should we pick people like dodgeball?
[160:18.39]Yeah, apparently.
[160:20.23]If you're yellow, orange, stand over here.
[160:22.97]If you're not orange, stand on the computer.
[160:26.15]How are they going to see our names?
[160:27.05]They're not close enough.
[160:28.34]Okay, a little closer.
[160:29.08]I think they know who's in the group.
[160:31.42]I think they know who they've been playing with.
[160:33.32]Yeah, but do they know our names?
[160:34.42]Alright, who picks first?
[160:39.11]Since Luigi never gets to be first player, Luigi, I'm going to give it to you.
[160:43.24]Oh, thank you, Mario.
[160:47.02]Thank you, Mario.
[160:52.40]Give us a Wahoo.
[160:54.54]No.
[160:56.04]No.
[160:57.40]No!
[160:57.96]I should have picked first.
[160:59.04]That's annoying.
[161:00.63]I got a Luigi.
[161:02.85]You got to be Luigi now.
[161:05.69]You got to make a Luigi noise.
[161:07.75]Mario.
[161:09.33]Your turn.
[161:10.87]It's pretty good.
[161:11.25]It's pretty good Luigi.
[161:16.94]He's getting a little sniffing.
[161:18.80]He's checking us out.
[161:22.30]I want Poke.
[161:26.72]Let's go.
[161:27.20]Poke, you gotta put on Mario.
[161:29.95]Okay.
[161:30.93]Get Mario.
[161:31.85]Put on your Mario.
[161:33.67]I'm a bad pick, by the way.
[161:36.89]I know.
[161:38.55]He was a pity pick.
[161:39.49]Okay.
[161:41.83]Yeah, we didn't want you to get picked last.
[161:43.99]You know how that would crush you?
[161:46.59]It would crush me.
[161:48.05]Got like 30 XP now.
[161:50.17]I'm picking Etalyx.
[161:52.51]Alright, let's do it.
[161:54.21]Crush you like an oversized Mario.
[161:56.83]Mario!
[161:58.91]I'm gonna spin around with my eyes closed and point.
[162:02.62]Etalyx, get your Luigi or your Mario costume.
[162:09.06]Got picked.
[162:10.72]Wow, the strategy.
[162:16.90]Alright, it's heating up.
[162:19.19]So wait, do we... How much XP do you guys have?
[162:21.99]I have 35.
[162:23.81]Oh, how do I know?
[162:24.70]I've played this game for 16 hours.
[162:28.08]Wait, how many hours do you have in the game?
[162:29.32]16.
[162:30.28]I pick you.
[162:31.64]This many.
[162:32.36]Okay, but how many of those were alive?
[162:34.26]I can't be the last player.
[162:37.68]15.
[162:38.34]I can't have this happen.
[162:41.27]I need to talk to Rambu.
[162:42.35]To be fair.
[162:42.79]I need to talk to Rambu.
[162:43.59]I need to talk to Rambu.
[162:44.33]I think you have to pitch for which one.
[162:47.19]Yeah, actually give it an elevator pitch.
[162:49.77]Don't let me be last pick.
[162:50.73]It's really embarrassing.
[162:52.53]I do.
[162:53.11]I mean, I was fully expecting me to be last pick.
[162:55.19]Really embarrassing.
[162:56.24]Really embarrassing.
[162:57.96]I keep falling into pits and I keep dying.
[163:00.38]Just all that.
[163:00.98]I just, I'm not good at this game.
[163:02.80]I have 35 XP.
[163:03.60]I have 30.
[163:04.08]How many?
[163:04.76]Two digits.
[163:06.42]Alright.
[163:06.80]So at the same time.
[163:10.74]He doesn't even have much XP.
[163:11.82]Here's at the same time.
[163:12.52]Alright.
[163:13.40]Connor, you are going to go to Mario and you're, Rambo, you're going to go to Luigi.
[163:19.00]Done.
[163:20.48]Okay.
[163:20.68]I just did it random.
[163:23.54]I don't feel like I'm last.
[163:25.02]That's our captain right there.
[163:26.20]You guys are on last.
[163:28.44]It was the same exact time.
[163:30.17]That's why you're the captain boss.
[163:31.97]But hey, I do have a very important point.
[163:34.19]If it was me out here and not a captain, I would have absolutely been last.
[163:36.75]You pressed the wrong button first.
[163:37.65]I saw that.
[163:39.57]What?
[163:39.81]What button?
[163:40.39]You pressed the dance button first.
[163:41.49]You meant to press the... Why do you have a gun?
[163:43.81]Amateur.
[163:44.47]You have a gun.
[163:45.41]What do they do?
[163:50.25]Alright, are we good?
[163:52.65]Wait, are we competing loot?
[163:57.05]I mean, we're still going to ultimately be helping each other.
[163:59.33]So, I think just stick to your team when you're inside.
[164:01.96]Alright, we're going to crush you!
[164:03.78]You green fuck!
[164:04.72]Hey, hey, hey!
[164:05.46]Mario's put your loot in this corner by the monitor.
[164:08.62]And Luigi's put your loot on this side.
[164:10.38]Alright, okay.
[164:11.54]Might as well just call it already because there's no way you guys are getting any loot.
[164:16.74]Hey, that's fine.
[164:19.66]Don't worry, we'll just follow Team Luigi.
[164:29.60]Who cares?
[164:31.66]Does Team Mario have an allowance?
[164:36.83]All the people that are doing Luigi impressions right now.
[164:39.31]You're not going like this.
[164:40.93]It's just wrong.
[164:43.73]Oh, that's true.
[164:44.49]What do you mean what?
[164:46.01]That's how Luigi talks.
[164:47.83]We don't need walkie-talkies to be sick as fuck.
[164:50.91]That's a good idea.
[164:51.71]No, they're not gonna do that.
[165:20.37]They're still waiting on walkie-talkies.
[165:21.51]They're not gonna be able to buy anything.
[165:22.39]Yeah, they're waiting.
[165:22.99]They're waiting on walkie-talkies.
[165:23.87]Just take everything we can.
[165:24.93]Just leave everything.
[165:25.99]They're gonna look so dumb.
[165:36.47]Right here, ice cream truck.
[165:38.75]That's a drop pot, right?
[165:40.99]Yeah, it's when they buy item.
[165:43.45]Oh.
[165:43.91]So we just take it from them.
[165:45.35]Never mind.
[165:48.54]If they die, they drop the walkie talkie and just pick it up.
[165:52.09]That's true.
[165:53.19]Is there really nothing here?
[165:55.11]I see a key.
[166:00.97]Mario!
[166:01.31]This is some good team cohesion.
[166:03.61]Oh, we're Mario's.
[166:05.30]It's a me.
[166:05.68]Yeah, we are the Mario's.
[166:06.94]We're the Mario's.
[166:07.70]Hey, what's up guys?
[166:11.38]What's up?
[166:13.22]We're gonna take all the loot.
[166:15.78]We're gonna bring it back to the ship.
[166:17.10]We're gonna make money.
[166:18.32]Don't worry, guys.
[166:19.05]So far we've got a singular key, we're five bucks up on them.
[166:23.53]That's true.
[166:25.21]They're fucking shaking in fear right now.
[166:28.57]This is a cool building.
[166:33.67]Once we find something, it's so over for them.
[166:36.69]Yeah, once we find anything at all, ever.
[166:40.35]Okay, it's just more dead ends.
[166:41.85]Awesome.
[166:43.48]What even is this building supposed to be?
[166:51.86]Oh, they found the apparatus.
[166:53.54]Fuck.
[166:54.38]Oh, mother... Mother Mia.
[166:56.44]Wait, what happened?
[166:59.38]They took the power cell, so now all the doors are open, and the power's off, so now all the scary creatures are out now.
[167:05.80]Even more so.
[167:07.10]Why would anybody do that?
[167:08.90]Because they're mean.
[167:09.66]Are we sure they're not all just back on the ship watching us?
[167:13.10]Because the apparatus is worth money.
[167:14.65]There should be anything in this room.
[167:21.11]I have an engine.
[167:34.01]Hey guys.
[167:36.03]Hey.
[167:36.19]Hey.
[167:37.35]Hey.
[167:37.47]Found ya.
[167:37.73]Did you find something?
[167:40.25]Are we all together?
[167:41.95]Found you.
[167:43.51]Ooh.
[167:43.69]Whoa!
[167:47.47]V-type engine right here.
[167:49.26]Ooh.
[167:49.76]Oh, sweet.
[167:50.84]Good find.
[167:51.62]Hell yeah.
[167:52.58]Excellent.
[167:53.28]Dead end right here.
[168:01.46]Ah, shit.
[168:03.58]How do we know they're not just gonna like lift off the ship?
[168:06.80]That's, yeah, they could do that.
[168:08.90]They could just leave.
[168:10.14]Oh, that's a turret right there!
[168:13.08]Where?
[168:13.58]That's a turret right there!
[168:17.62]It's facing the other way.
[168:18.92]Oh, it's off too.
[168:19.56]It's facing that way.
[168:20.80]Okay.
[168:21.30]It's facing that way, yeah.
[168:22.70]Okay, they're getting stuff.
[168:24.31]Okay, they have, they got a couple things.
[168:25.89]We have more than money.
[168:26.65]That's okay.
[168:27.47]We'll arm stuff.
[168:30.63]We'll have stuff.
[168:31.59]Fear not.
[168:32.21]What is going on?
[168:36.51]What?
[168:36.81]You okay?
[168:38.78]No, yeah.
[168:39.80]Hello?
[168:40.70]There's nothing.
[168:42.00]You know that fish video?
[168:43.22]With the guy yelling at the fish?
[168:46.50]What is going on?
[168:49.46]I haven't seen it.
[168:52.23]You don't know what I'm talking about?
[168:53.97]I haven't seen it.
[168:56.09]Is it a funny video?
[168:58.07]I like it.
[168:59.37]You see some guy staring at this fish thing.
[169:01.93]I don't know, you gotta see it.
[169:06.49]Where are you, Poke?
[169:08.16]They're like down and over to the right side.
[169:14.18]Hey, man.
[169:14.76]Oh!
[169:15.50]What is happening?
[169:16.48]What the fuck just happened?
[169:17.22]This is going to be war.
[169:18.20]What happened?
[169:18.60]We have established a war between us and Mario.
[169:21.42]We're about to get the princess.
[169:23.40]You get them.
[169:24.30]They're all like me.
[169:40.49]I'm not doing a Mario voice for this.
[169:42.94]I'm pissed.
[169:47.67]I just wanted to be said that you guys are predictable and shameful because I called this.
[169:52.44]Yep.
[169:53.10]Yeah, you did.
[169:53.62]It's true.
[169:54.06]How much are you bringing back to the ship?
[169:56.82]I fell down a shaft like five minutes ago.
[169:59.46]The Ouijis are cheating.
[170:00.34]I walked and I fell down a hole.
[170:01.62]Yeah, that's true.
[170:02.40]Super Ouija time.
[170:14.05]I was dead for like five minutes.
[170:16.65]They thought they were so funny.
[170:19.55]They thought they were so funny.
[170:20.83]So funny.
[170:21.11]Can we count what we actually had in our inventories?
[170:30.39]We had a lot of stuff in our inventory.
[170:31.67]I can't even tell who's doing the Mario and Luigi voices.
[170:36.00]They're all becoming the same voice.
[170:37.22]Pokim!
[170:37.42]Pokim, I remember the problem you had earlier.
[170:54.82]Alright guys, Mario with me!
[170:57.50]Mario!
[170:58.94]Backwards long jump yourself off a cliff!
[171:02.50]Mario's got the moves!
[171:04.18]Time to go get some loot!
[171:05.96]This is fucking stupid!
[171:08.16]Keep walking Mario, good job Mario!
[171:10.02]Yeah, yeah!
[171:11.40]Yeah!
[171:12.88]Mario, Mario!
[171:14.63]There's the princess, I love her!
[171:17.29]Mario!
[171:18.51]Over here Luigi's!
[171:19.95]Guys, this is a fucking nightmare!
[171:25.48]Those dumb bitches.
[171:26.54]Now we go to the first.
[171:30.34]Alright dude.
[171:30.88]I gotta tell ya.
[171:31.62]That was... That was... That was... That was... That was... That was... That was...
[171:53.03]That was like, Mario, what are we gonna do today?
[171:58.17]That was the best Mario impression all night.
[172:03.70]That was hands down the best one all night.
[172:11.35]What the fuck?
[172:18.11]You better do the voice, Vinny.
[172:25.44]Oh, is there stuff down there?
[172:27.86]Oh, I don't know.
[172:29.02]Let me just go over here.
[172:29.84]There's probably a monster waiting for me.
[172:32.09]I think I am stupid.
[172:37.77]I lost my Mario's.
[172:38.71]I was too distracted by all the Luigi's.
[172:40.03]Yeah, I think there's gear over here.
[172:41.95]Yeah, there's stuff over here.
[172:43.19]I want to split it with you, so.
[172:53.93]What is that?
[172:55.07]What's that noise?
[172:56.07]It's a bug.
[172:56.61]It's a bug.
[172:57.13]It's a bug.
[172:57.69]A bug?
[172:58.25]It's a bug.
[172:58.71]No, I can't do it.
[172:59.65]It was a bug, yeah.
[173:02.24]Trying to block him.
[173:09.26]Uh, Mario's... Can I get a Mario first?
[173:13.30]Any Mario's here in the building?
[173:18.11]Luigi's were just fucking yapping my ear off.
[173:21.73]Any Mario's?
[173:27.66]Hey, there you are.
[173:29.18]Hey, there's a lot of drama going on.
[173:31.54]It's really weird.
[173:33.23]Yeah.
[173:36.53]I'm getting pressed by Luigi.
[173:51.93]Prove that I was always the better brother.
[173:56.16]Let's go.
[174:02.93]I wish I had a fucking weapon right now.
[174:05.07]You have no idea.
[174:06.89]I wish I had a weapon right now.
[174:08.61]Is there a weapon?
[174:10.14]We need to kill Luigi.
[174:13.36]We could buy one.
[174:16.34]We could buy one right now?
[174:18.80]We could buy a weapon.
[174:20.28]Let's go.
[174:21.09]Let's get a weapon.
[174:21.51]Let's buy a weapon and we're going to kill the whole team.
[174:23.79]Do we have money?
[174:24.31]I don't know.
[174:25.35]Do we?
[174:31.80]Wait, wait, I have an idea.
[174:33.04]You can buy like a bomb or something.
[174:36.12]And then get them all together.
[174:37.58]I don't know.
[174:37.93]I don't know.
[174:38.75]Can you buy mines?
[174:41.03]I think so.
[174:41.35]I don't think so.
[174:41.81]Let's go look.
[174:44.69]Oh, is that a Mario?
[174:45.99]Is it Mario?
[174:47.83]It's a me, Mario.
[174:50.05]Oh, it is.
[174:50.53]It is.
[174:51.58]It is Mario.
[174:53.64]Mario, Mario, come.
[174:55.56]We have a mine.
[174:55.98]Mario wins.
[175:01.07]Let's unleave her the asses.
[175:03.55]If they want to play dirt, is anyone in here?
[175:05.90]He is.
[175:07.06]Get the fuck out.
[175:08.78]Stinky Luigi.
[175:11.40]Dude, you shouldn't be like an agent.
[175:13.28]Imposter.
[175:14.36]You should be sus.
[175:16.14]Dude, you gotta help us.
[175:17.75]Don't tell them what we're gonna plan.
[175:19.67]Listen, we should get like a teleporter and just start teleporting them out with no loot.
[175:25.67]Get me a stop sign, I'll kill them all.
[175:27.93]That's what we were gonna do.
[175:28.76]Or that.
[175:32.78]Why not just use your hammer, Luigi?
[175:35.40]You're immediately on board to do this.
[175:38.30]Oh, we have no money.
[175:39.20]We have no money.
[175:41.24]Whoa!
[175:43.98]Buy me a shovel and I'll kill them all.
[175:48.01]We didn't even give him that thought.
[175:50.41]Just don't say anything yet.
[175:53.45]Wait, block him.
[175:54.35]Block him from coming in.
[176:01.11]Mamma mia.
[176:02.11]Wait, what's our loot?
[176:04.01]Ster, Ster, give it to me.
[176:06.15]Ster, give it to me.
[176:08.69]Ster, give it to me.
[176:10.19]Let me see the walkie-talkies, Ster.
[176:11.75]Oh, we could just block them out.
[176:12.95]Guys, you die.
[176:14.85]This is for the good of all of us.
[176:16.65]We're cooperating.
[176:18.94]You can just move it with B. We're cooperating here.
[176:24.42]Yes.
[176:25.10]No, but we're cooperating.
[176:26.56]We're friends.
[176:27.36]We're brothers.
[176:28.99]What's the password?
[176:31.05]Fidelio.
[176:32.51]Oh, shit.
[176:34.55]I'm out here.
[176:35.49]Hey.
[176:35.70]I'm out here, too.
[176:36.56]I'm out here, too.
[176:37.18]One of the Marios.
[176:38.00]What's the password?
[176:39.60]Why is it a hole in the wall?
[176:41.26]Enter the secret password.
[176:43.30]Password.
[176:44.44]Password is puke.
[176:46.04]P-U-P-U-P.
[176:48.32]That's the password.
[176:49.12]P-U-P-U-P.
[176:49.50]P-U-P-U-P.
[176:57.05]Fuck.
[176:58.61]I got both headphones and I'm speech jamming myself.
[177:00.77]I'm sorry.
[177:01.29]What the fuck is going on?
[177:13.25]I think what we need to do is... How much money do we have?
[177:21.14]We have a good amount.
[177:23.14]We're near the enemy.
[177:24.44]We have enough to buy... We have enough to buy 10 shovels.
[177:27.81]Hey guys, I'm out here.
[177:28.91]Oh, shovels you say?
[177:30.19]Oh, hey.
[177:31.29]Is there enough to buy 10 shovels?
[177:32.36]I made friends with a monster.
[177:39.72]Nobody believes me.
[177:41.82]Uh, do we have enough to buy ten shovels?
[177:44.22]Yeah, so when we turn it in, is there enough to buy shovels?
[177:46.52]It's a me!
[177:46.94]Wah-ha!
[178:07.37]Someone in my chat just said, you need this bit.
[178:09.17]It's warding off the monsters.
[178:11.70]Mario 66B!
[178:12.42]I haven't seen a single Wario.
[178:14.40]What happened to my Luigi's?
[178:15.62]Why aren't they Wario's now?
[178:16.72]How much is this?
[178:17.28]How much is one shovel?
[178:18.30]Because Luigi pooped.
[178:24.08]Everyone wants to be Mario.
[178:25.80]Wait, let me see the store.
[178:26.61]Can I see?
[178:28.57]Let me see it.
[178:30.63]Wait, no, no.
[178:30.93]I don't want to go to the store.
[178:34.71]The monsters are just jumping into pits and ending it all.
[178:37.20]I want to do a 5v5 shovel war.
[178:40.26]I want to get 10 shovels and fight to the death.
[178:42.30]Like we should.
[178:56.04]No, we're doing good.
[178:57.02]We're actually doing pretty well.
[178:58.82]Actually, that's kind of awesome though.
[179:00.60]We could collaborate now.
[179:02.12]It's strange that we get enough money to do a 5v5 afterwards.
[179:08.65]At the very end.
[179:10.25]Yeah, we definitely have to do that.
[179:11.57]We could if we win this.
[179:13.59]Alright, let's try to make some real money.
[179:15.73]Because I want to see a 5v5 shovel death battle in the ship.
[179:20.07]Or like around the ship.
[179:20.89]Okay.
[179:25.71]1v1 tournament?
[179:26.69]Okay, where are we going?
[179:29.84]Wanna do Stormy?
[179:30.64]I can't see the... Storm... Be careful with Stormy, there's potential to sink.
[179:37.92]Stormy's a little rough.
[179:38.67]Yeah, what kind of problems?
[179:39.89]Can you sink in that one too, or no?
[179:43.01]No, Rainy is the one that has quicksand.
[179:44.89]Yeah, quicksand.
[179:47.88]Yeah, when we turn when we finally turn everything in and get all the money, we'll do it at the company building.
[179:56.55]You didn't dump you, you just moved on to the next chapter.
[180:00.31]She found out I had toads undies.
[180:05.44]Toad doesn't wear underwear.
[180:07.44]There's a lot of questions there actually.
[180:10.61]No, no, no toad.
[180:11.13]No toad.
[180:11.61]No toad.
[180:12.23]I'll pay money.
[180:12.67]I'll pay real money to have no toads.
[180:15.03]Yeah, we got enough money.
[180:42.11]Oh, fuck.
[180:42.61]I was looking at my phone.
[180:49.77]Wait, we gotta go this way.
[180:52.38]Sneak, are you there?
[180:52.98]Ah, shit.
[180:59.40]Fuck, I was looking at my phone.
[181:03.09]It's this way, right?
[181:14.62]No, I'm not going for the bees in no way.
[181:16.26]Not right now.
[181:30.87]Because they were.
[181:33.29]I'm being weird.
[181:34.23]It's not blocked.
[181:36.55]They were telling me, hey, hey, they were just.
[181:45.04]That the Mario was a suicide bomber!
[181:48.14]What the?
[181:48.68]He killed one of our own!
[181:50.92]He killed one of ours!
[181:52.62]In the middle of a ceasefire!
[181:55.86]Violent ceasefire!
[181:57.34]Ceasefire!
[181:58.74]He actually did it.
[182:00.50]That crazy bastard.
[182:02.78]What happened?
[182:05.06]He stepped on a mine.
[182:07.50]Oh, I thought a monster just like threw him across the room.
[182:10.60]Oh, they got items again.
[182:12.23]I got grinding thunder again.
[182:14.28]Alright, I gotta, let me put this out here.
[182:21.24]What did I miss?
[182:24.00]Uh, something bad.
[182:29.54]Carry on.
[182:31.76]There's a landmine.
[182:43.76]Blue shelled.
[182:47.46]That's a good one.
[183:09.99]Cool.
[183:12.17]Money.
[183:14.70]Alright, what side is ours?
[183:18.20]I'm just kidding.
[183:20.82]Oh, yeah, right.
[183:21.58]I don't think we're doing the Luigi versus Mario right now.
[183:27.20]Shut up.
[183:27.84]Yes, we are.
[183:28.72]I think we're just trying to make money so that we can have the real fight between the two brothers.
[183:35.99]The real fight never ends.
[183:39.17]Polk killed himself.
[183:42.77]to kill one Luigi.
[183:45.94]The war is still very much on.
[183:49.12]Wait.
[183:56.12]Yeah, he lured as many of the Luigi's around the landmark as he could.
[184:00.42]Wait, what?
[184:02.74]He only got one of them though.
[184:05.02]The other ones managed to escape.
[184:08.82]What the fuck?
[184:12.28]Oh, no.
[184:12.96]Okay, well, we... We need money.
[184:23.19]Mario?
[184:25.78]Luigi!
[184:26.32]What was that?
[184:30.74]What was that?
[184:31.72]My stomach.
[184:32.32]Scary sound.
[184:40.41]Are we good?
[184:42.11]Are we missing anything?
[184:43.49]Are we good to go?
[184:44.69]Mario!
[184:45.65]Mario!
[184:51.80]What the fuck is that thing?
[184:55.76]Luigi!
[185:01.84]Are you doing that scary sound?
[185:03.74]No, I hear it too.
[185:04.76]There's a landmine right there.
[185:05.84]Careful.
[185:07.45]Is that a lamb?
[185:08.09]Is that a...
[185:13.06]I can't tell if somebody is making those noises as a joke or if they're in the game.
[185:20.79]Yeah, he just sits and talks.
[185:33.37]Yeah, you think that's funny?
[185:34.35]You think that's funny?
[185:35.03]One of the Mario's is dead, huh?
[185:38.14]I see two Luigi's here.
[185:42.06]What about it?
[185:43.60]What about it?

[187:34.32]Gotta commit to that bit, man.
[187:37.28]Mario!
[187:38.44]There's some bees on the back of the ship!
[187:44.61]Are there bees on the ship?
[187:47.50]Who put the bees there, dude?
[187:48.60]The last one.
[187:49.10]Here.
[187:49.30]Hey.

[187:49.58]Come here.
[187:50.20]I have a... How much health do you have?
[187:51.29]I just keep burping.
[187:53.65]Sucks.
[187:54.59]Around the corner there, there's a beehive.
[187:56.35]I put it on like the grate.
[187:57.53]If you could bring it in, we gotta take off.
[187:59.95]Okay.
[188:01.13]Bring it in.
[188:01.61]Drop it like right here.
[188:03.65]And I'm gonna take off once you come in.
[188:07.50]Is there any more Luigi in the house?
[188:10.78]No, everyone's dead.
[188:12.92]Luigi time.
[188:13.38]He's so blunted on it.
[188:15.00]He's stuttering like a shit about the Luigi's.
[188:17.58]He just wants to win.
[188:18.94]Didn't Sturgess tell him there were no more Luigi's?
[188:23.48]Oh, they're fucking dead.
[188:25.74]Let's pull the lever.
[188:26.50]They actually did it.
[188:27.30]They did it?
[188:28.28]Wow, really?
[188:29.04]Luigi time.
[188:40.57]Are you guys ready for the war?
[188:43.28]Yes.
[188:43.92]Oh, we're doing it now?
[188:45.52]Are you ready?
[188:46.52]Luigi number one!
[188:53.36]Make your next move carefully, because the war begins right now.
[189:01.37]We can buy all the shovels.
[189:02.85]Ten shovels.
[189:06.38]Mario, stay at the monitor.
[189:09.83]You will die.
[189:15.97]Hello?
[189:17.59]That wasn't me.
[189:17.95]I swear to God.
[189:18.49]I swear to God that wasn't me.
[189:19.65]That wasn't me.
[189:20.11]I swear to God, guys.
[189:21.25]Are you moving it?
[189:22.06]Are you moving it?
[189:26.40]I'm not moving it.
[189:27.02]Are you moving it?
[189:27.52]Excuse me?
[189:38.20]I still don't really know what Skibidi Toilet is.
[189:59.97]It's a mind virus is what it is.
[190:03.13]It's also a great way to lose your audience.
[190:06.31]Alright, what am I doing wrong?
[190:12.42]Step back.
[190:13.46]You have to look at the right pixel.
[190:15.02]Vinny, who do you think are the good guys?
[190:18.38]Is it the cameras?
[190:19.32]Is it the TVs?
[190:20.54]Or is it the Skibidi Toilets?
[190:22.38]It's the oil.
[190:23.80]It's the oil people.
[190:26.14]I stopped at episode 36, so I don't know what happens in the next 40 episodes.
[190:30.45]yeah there's I think the cameramen and the oil people go to war and then there was a bunch of like magpies that turned into giant robots it was crazy alright let's do ten shovels right yeah and there was a skedaddle urinal you want to go to a tier three planet because we can spend 500 bucks on that or um on shovels and beat each other to death let's do that
[190:53.90]Let's do the shovels.
[190:54.66]We need to settle this.
[190:56.50]Okay, let's do the shovels.
[190:59.14]We have to get it out of our system.
[191:01.01]Everybody go to the thing.
[191:02.59]Alright.
[191:03.03]Everybody wait for the shovels.
[191:04.35]We have to beat each other to death to get it out of our system so we can be a team.
[191:06.97]This is a team building exercise.
[191:09.63]Okay.
[191:09.93]We have to be in a well lit area.
[191:12.35]Goodbye.
[191:13.11]Who just... Did he die?
[191:15.41]What's in here?
[191:19.61]Is there something in there?
[191:21.73]Should I go in?
[191:28.21]The world's most geriatric iPad baby.
[191:30.19]I want one too.
[191:30.59]Are we gonna fight with shovels?
[191:33.33]That's the plan.
[191:34.49]How many shovels do we have?
[191:35.71]We have 10?
[191:54.70]Did you... You didn't already start swinging, did you?
[191:58.54]Ster!
[191:58.66]Ster, what the... What the...
[192:14.70]There's some drama.
[192:15.96]Also, the talus is dead, so we really probably shouldn't do the shovel thing until we... How did he die?
[192:22.64]He jumped down a urinal.
[192:25.36]What are they called?
[192:26.60]Great.
[192:27.16]Did we lose the shovels?
[192:30.72]We don't lose this stuff, right?
[192:33.25]I hate when that happens.
[192:34.43]Do we have enough for the roll?
[192:36.39]I think we have 10, it's just that we don't have our fifth Mario.
[192:39.53]Alright, if you don't have a shovel, we'll take it off your name.
[192:43.21]He fell into the great warp pipe into the sky, so we need our fifth Mario.
[192:46.39]Wait, he's outside!
[192:48.76]What?
[192:48.94]No, he's not, he's dead.
[192:49.82]Oh, he's alive?
[192:50.44]Wait, what?
[192:52.78]What?
[192:53.16]You guys said he was dead!
[192:57.86]You said he was dead!
[192:58.68]Wait,
[193:02.88]Oh my god, I saw him jump into the air.
[193:05.45]Do you think he's mad?
[193:07.13]I thought you guys were gonna fight with the shovels.
[193:09.83]What happened?
[193:11.85]We thought you died.
[193:12.53]We thought you died.
[193:13.25]We thought he was dead.
[193:14.83]You weren't moving, dude.
[193:20.07]Final shovel on the ground.
[193:20.81]Grab it.
[193:21.03]Hey, stop swinging.
[193:21.63]You're going to accidentally hit somebody.
[193:41.26]Look.
[193:41.44]This is just a Medal of Honor campaign.
[193:43.18]I'm just gonna follow whichever of you drop your shovel and pick it up and beat them down.
[193:48.10]Big open field.
[193:48.58]Oh.
[193:48.66]Drama.
[193:48.88]Alright.
[193:49.36]Let's go.
[193:49.62]Hey.
[193:49.70]Are we doing... Hey.
[193:50.62]I have an idea.
[193:51.92]I have an idea.
[193:52.78]What's the idea?
[193:53.36]What if...
[193:58.85]Mario!
[193:59.25]Mario!
[193:59.93]Mario!
[194:00.41]What if, hold on, we found the side exit.
[194:04.15]Both teams would have each exit.
[194:05.71]And we meet inside and fight each other.
[194:07.91]Meet inside?
[194:09.37]Yeah.
[194:09.97]That's good.
[194:10.44]That's good.
[194:10.88]That's good.
[194:11.30]That's good.
[194:12.86]That's good.
[194:13.56]Did somebody land us yet or no?
[194:16.50]We meet in the middle.
[194:18.24]Team Mario goes side exit and Luigi goes main entrance and we meet inside and fight to death.
[194:23.10]That's perfect.
[194:23.46]I agree, I agree.
[194:24.24]Okay, there's one fact that you guys are forgetting.
[194:26.83]That friendly fire, like the shovels don't know if you're on the same team or not.
[194:31.23]Yes.
[194:31.61]That's fine.
[194:32.37]That's right.
[194:32.95]Don't worry.
[194:35.13]I would never hit a Mario.
[194:38.71]Yeah, you'll never catch me hitting a Mario with this shovel.
[194:43.13]Ever.
[194:44.03]Isn't that sexy?
[194:45.73]You wouldn't download a Mario.
[194:47.49]Team Luigi, we go to
[194:49.57]Watch your health, team Mario.
[194:50.83]Don't lose HP for no reason.
[194:52.57]Why don't they do that?
[194:53.95]Oh, you're right.
[194:55.83]Alright, Mario team.
[194:56.83]Who wants to lead?
[194:57.93]Mario's fire exit.
[194:59.17]Alright, Mario's.
[195:00.19]Let's go.
[195:01.19]Okay, Luigi front.
[195:03.19]Wait, are we fighting each other?
[195:04.81]Luigi likes full frontals anyway.
[195:06.27]Are we hunting each other down in the building?
[195:08.17]In the building.
[195:09.51]I thought we were doing a standoff in the field.
[195:11.85]Alright.
[195:12.19]Alright, so we go to Mario's... Mario!
[195:13.43]We only got five of us.
[195:14.53]Do we have five?
[195:15.40]Hold here for a sec.
[195:16.24]There's only four of us.
[195:17.58]There's only four of us.
[195:18.40]Who are we missing?
[195:20.28]Who are we missing?
[195:37.51]We only have four.
[195:39.67]Oh, wait.
[195:40.85]This isn't fair because there's nine people.
[195:42.91]Are there five Luigi's?
[195:47.13]No, no, no.
[195:47.61]We have ten.
[195:49.27]Where's the other one?
[195:51.46]Where's our... He might be hiding, actually.
[195:57.64]Alright.
[195:59.52]Alright, let's do it.
[196:01.44]Yep.
[196:04.82]What the fuck just happened?
[196:09.05]What?
[196:10.47]Mario ruined it for everyone.
[196:12.27]Oh my god.
[196:14.25]What just happened?
[196:15.85]Etalyx ruined it.
[196:18.45]No, what?
[196:18.75]Etalyx, what are you doing?
[196:20.59]What?
[196:20.89]We don't have the shovels anymore.
[196:22.79]They're gone.
[196:24.39]Why did you leave?
[196:26.01]What?
[196:26.33]Why?
[196:35.83]Because you guys all left me, bitch!
[196:37.73]Now who's the one who gets left behind?
[196:40.75]You all!
[196:42.93]But now we have the shovels.
[196:44.05]Oh my fucking god.
[196:45.41]Now we actually don't have any money.
[196:48.07]The bit is ruined now.
[196:49.69]We have no tips to farm now.
[196:52.09]Mario's looking forward to spilling blood!
[196:54.42]In the name of true peace, I refuse to let any Mario shed Luigi blood.
[197:01.08]Or vice versa.
[197:02.74]Now that's what you say, of course.
[197:07.64]Do we have any more money to buy shovels?
[197:10.02]Oh no.
[197:11.10]Oh my god.
[197:11.40]We were looking for you.
[197:12.04]We were like, where's our fifth Mario?
[197:33.72]We walked in there like stealth ops and we were ready and then you left us.
[197:37.96]Look, it was funny for two seconds and now... Mario was gonna win!
[197:44.46]My bit was better, it's okay.
[197:46.62]Alright!
[197:46.92]Let's uh... Let's go to the... Where can we go?
[197:49.57]Where can we even go?
[197:50.41]I guess we'll just play the game now.
[197:56.07]Starting from zero, yeah.
[197:57.89]I guess so.
[197:58.41]I guess we'll just play the game.
[198:05.71]I'm done with the audio and Luigi bit.
[198:07.47]I'm going to me.
[198:10.61]It's me.
[198:11.17]I'm going to.
[198:13.15]I'm going to be Kirby.
[198:14.39]I'm going.
[198:15.09]I'm going default.
[198:18.13]Like a blue take a walkie talkie.
[198:24.85]Guys, I'm quicksand.
[198:27.41]That's quicksand right there.
[198:28.51]That's quicksand right there.
[198:30.65]How do you know that's quicksand?
[198:32.37]Because of the guy who just fell in and died.
[198:35.45]Right.
[198:35.96]Like a quicksand bit.
[198:37.24]I can do that.
[198:38.26]And well, it wasn't a bit.
[198:39.68]He's just he just actually said there's no bit.
[198:45.16]He's just a goner.
[198:48.49]Oh, let's do it.
[198:49.47]On behalf of all of the first time chatters I see, I'd like to formally apologize for making everyone mad.
[198:57.11]Oh my god, I can't believe it.
[198:59.53]You ruined my experience.
[199:02.14]I'm so angry as a viewer.
[199:03.72]I think I'm going to go into your Twitch chat.
[199:07.64]What's wrong with you?
[199:08.94]You look like sick.
[199:11.46]Oh, were you crouching?
[199:16.38]It looked like you were holding your stomach.
[199:20.83]That's quicksand right there.
[199:22.71]And now we're leaving.
[199:25.57]Who called the ship back already?
[199:28.15]Are we serious?
[199:31.33]Oh my god.
[199:33.95]I don't think we can go across this.
[199:38.16]Can we get across it?
[199:39.24]Wait, okay, you can go around the right.
[199:45.20]Oh, God damn it.
[199:46.40]No.
[199:46.62]Puppies.
[199:56.87]Oh, apparatus.
[199:59.25]This way to the building.
[200:00.59]They're already getting that.
[200:03.59]Not that way.
[200:04.29]This way.
[200:04.83]Around the pumpkin.
[200:08.55]Do, do, do, do, do.
[200:09.74]Boing.
[200:10.04]Big ass.
[200:10.50]I almost fell, but it's fine.
[200:12.58]Don't we have to leave him in like...
[200:14.91]Oh, my stamina.
[200:15.89]It's this way.
[200:16.23]Hey, who wants the walkie talkie?
[200:17.69]Talk to rocks.
[200:44.25]Wait, why is the ship leaving?
[200:45.45]What?
[200:46.05]What?
[200:46.17]What's happening?
[200:47.27]What is happening?
[200:48.73]Why?
[200:48.95]Why?
[200:57.81]Yeah, I'm here and I'm serious.
[200:59.81]Yeah.
[201:00.57]The Reddit thread for this stream is spicy.
[201:03.07]Guys.
[201:04.37]What just happened?
[201:05.23]Why?
[201:05.41]Why?
[201:06.39]Why did you do that over?
[201:08.81]Who the frick did that?
[201:10.67]Who did it?
[201:11.33]I just want to say I appreciate the Family Guy dedication to doing the same bit twice in a row.
[201:15.93]Just keep doing it until people laugh.
[201:17.79]Did he do it twice?
[201:19.65]What just happened?
[201:20.45]I can't believe you did it again.
[201:23.24]I didn't do it.
[201:26.57]People are going to stop getting fired.
[201:28.37]It was me.
[201:28.91]It was me.
[201:29.62]I was your ghost.
[201:30.60]I was the ghost.
[201:31.46]Etalyx was with me down there.
[201:33.52]I can vouch for Etalyx.
[201:40.95]I did it.
[201:43.23]Why'd you do it?
[201:44.89]Why'd you do it?
[201:46.73]I got one more good one.
[201:48.03]One more good one.
[201:51.00]I got one more good one in me.
[201:52.80]One more good one.
[201:55.64]No pulling levers, no pushing buttons, no ship takeoff.
[201:59.80]And someone who knows what they're doing, take the walkie-talkie.
[202:04.15]We lost the walkie talkie, didn't we?
[202:06.23]Don't worry.
[202:07.11]Oh yeah, no, I definitely left it out there.
[202:08.81]Yeah, somebody called the ship early and we all got abandoned.
[202:12.09]Yeah, it was my chat that did that.
[202:13.23]There's a key in here, should I take the key?
[202:14.59]Oh, Perry's got the key.
[202:18.44]Alright, let's go.
[202:18.88]Alright.
[202:20.22]Shit.
[202:26.00]Jeremy, I like how, like, you proposed, like, a team thing.
[202:28.49]You're like, hey, like, let's put up on the five teams, Mario and Luigi.
[202:31.67]I think with probably the intention of, like, different games, and it just became a Mario versus Luigi, like, battle for three games in a row.
[202:37.71]It's a complete misinterpretation of what you probably intended.
[202:44.04]I don't know if anybody else picked up on that, but I was, I was actively confused.
[202:47.88]You, see, you, you, you paid, you paid attention.
[202:51.20]You paid attention.
[202:55.21]Oh, shit.
[202:56.63]Oh, no.
[203:01.26]The vibes were pretty off, huh, guys?
[203:02.74]We're just hanging out.
[203:04.34]Hey, we're going in.
[203:05.76]What are we hanging out on a hill for?
[203:07.22]Yeah, we were just talking.
[203:08.84]We're just catching up, you know?
[203:10.30]Yeah.
[203:11.58]We got loot together.
[203:12.88]Oh, wait.
[203:14.13]Oh, wait.
[203:15.27]Sorry.
[203:18.27]Great.
[203:18.71]There's another one over here.
[203:27.88]Poke.
[203:28.30]Where are you, Poke?
[203:33.38]Apparatus.
[203:35.60]Let's just block two.
[203:37.56]I think he's got bees.
[203:38.97]There we are.
[203:39.53]Uh-oh.
[203:40.99]Ooh, that's good.
[203:42.61]Apparatus.
[203:45.53]Uh-oh.
[203:47.51]I've got a glowing thing on my hands.
[203:49.63]Doo-dah.
[203:50.48]Doo-dah.
[203:51.32]I'm dying of radiation poisoning.
[203:54.14]Yeah, no, I have.
[203:59.17]Oh my.
[204:00.47]Oh my god.
[204:02.07]Somebody is fucking with us.
[204:05.11]Don't go outside.
[204:05.83]I got the beehive off the front door because it was keeping the bees there.
[204:11.70]Don't go out there right now.
[204:14.84]They can't get inside right?
[204:16.66]Yeah no they can't but someone as a joke left it at the door so that when we tried to leave we all died.
[204:22.36]Alright which one of you sick fucks put the beehive at the doorway?
[204:26.06]That's real mature.
[204:28.50]It was you.
[204:30.83]It was you.
[204:31.43]It wasn't.
[204:32.01]It wasn't.
[204:33.01]Okay.
[204:33.59]Usually it's the first person to say it.
[204:35.19]Does someone want to check?
[204:36.35]Does someone want to check if there's bees out there?
[204:46.24]No bees.
[204:47.24]Good news.
[204:48.36]No bees.
[204:54.51]We're good.
[204:54.75]They're holding the hive.
[204:55.50]Is that bad?
[204:57.08]Well, let's just get going before they notice.
[205:03.24]I think the bee guy might have been Vinny.
[205:07.28]Okay.
[205:08.42]Which way was it?
[205:09.04]It was like down here.
[205:09.79]Oh, shit.
[205:11.31]The bees.
[205:13.33]Just run.
[205:14.19]Just go.
[205:14.45]Just go.
[205:14.71]Just go.
[205:14.95]Just go.
[205:15.33]Oh, shit.
[205:16.65]Oh, shit.
[205:17.69]Oh, this is not good.
[205:18.73]I have no stamina.
[205:22.97]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[205:24.05]Let's get that inside and put it in the very back of the ship.
[205:28.45]Yep.
[205:34.77]Yes.
[205:38.62]There we go.
[205:39.72]Alright.
[205:40.22]That's a hundred.
[205:41.44]What's the apparatus?
[205:44.18]Oh, there it is.
[205:45.10]Okay.
[205:48.90]so we've got uh okay collectively we have let's see here that's a lot of money there we go anybody else still alive let's look
[206:12.39]I think so, yeah.
[206:13.61]I think they're still alive.
[206:14.84]I think we've lost one person.
[206:18.26]Coke's still alive.
[206:19.52]Ross, Sneak's still alive.
[206:21.80]Sarah's still alive.
[206:23.92]Criken's still alive, I think.
[206:26.90]Everyone seems to be doing pretty good.
[206:28.45]I'm gonna go back in.
[206:29.77]There's a monster in there.
[206:30.57]Does everybody like heal?
[206:32.71]I got bit by bees.
[206:35.50]I heard in the normal game if you change outfit it heals you, but I don't think it does.
[206:41.50]I don't think there's any way to heal.
[206:49.35]Need to add more emotes to this.
[206:51.17]Sneak dial.
[206:51.87]I agree.
[206:52.77]I agree.
[206:57.45]Get off the monitor!
[207:07.00]Ask how to open doors?
[207:08.08]I know how to open doors.
[207:09.06]I'm not stupid.
[207:11.84]Press E. Yeah, they're still out there.
[207:20.27]Do we have a weapon?
[207:24.25]Someone just walked off with a stop sign.
[207:25.85]I don't know who it was.
[207:32.62]I am terrified to go anywhere.
[207:36.51]Criken is coming back with something.
[207:38.51]Make that stop sign and start killing.
[207:40.78]Oh, poke looks like he's dead near Criken.
[207:46.32]Oh, they found a bunch of stuff.
[207:48.88]Oh, soda.
[207:49.74]What kind is it?
[207:51.82]It's a soda.
[207:53.25]Let me give it a try.
[207:54.55]We got soda.
[207:59.55]Oh, nice.
[208:01.39]That's a standard cola.
[208:03.63]Yeah, you have some Ross.
[208:05.90]Oh, thanks.
[208:12.14]Just the right amount of bite?
[208:14.04]I'm trying.
[208:14.50]Yeah, I'm working up to it.
[208:15.70]I don't have anything.
[208:17.09]Okay.
[208:17.69]Now you got it.
[208:20.73]Did you make it?
[208:21.21]Another beehive.
[208:23.05]Ooh.
[208:23.95]There we go.
[208:24.57]There we go.
[208:26.59]Two beehives?
[208:28.07]That's... He's drinking soda.
[208:39.41]That was awesome.
[208:41.91]It must have been a lot of caffeine in that soda.
[208:43.63]Your eyes are going wild.
[208:44.57]What's that creature?
[208:45.09]Yeah, why are there so many B sounds?
[208:48.58]Oh, do we need to?
[208:49.20]We leave.
[208:49.56]Oh no, are they in?
[208:50.36]Did they get in?
[209:06.37]no no stop oh do we leave I think we should we have to just hit the button don't we they started is doing the sacrifice play how did they find the hive
[209:30.53]Did it actually take off?
[209:32.55]Yeah, there were bees up there.
[209:34.95]Were there bees on the ship and you'd take off with them and die?
[209:40.53]Where did those bees come from?
[209:41.95]I waited too long.
[209:59.76]And you left at the same time.
[210:00.94]Is that what happened?
[210:02.48]I had nothing to do with that.
[210:04.16]I was dead for the whole round.
[210:06.16]I just saw the beast come in and then... There were like four of you still alive out there, though.
[210:09.69]That's why I didn't want to leave.
[210:11.35]Yeah, I don't... But you did though.
[210:14.03]Yeah, I was on my way back.
[210:15.17]I did.
[210:16.13]Me and Draken could see it leave.
[210:17.99]Yeah.
[210:19.19]I saw you.
[210:21.19]I put the bees in front of the door, but I did not put any bees on the ship because the bees killed me.
[210:26.69]That's true.
[210:27.45]He's telling the truth.
[210:28.76]I am telling the truth.
[210:29.62]I was dead the whole time, but I did put them in front of the door and I almost died from a laughing fit.
[210:34.20]Remember before this, when we were all friends?
[210:38.94]That was a long time ago.
[210:41.70]Hey, Jerry.
[210:45.53]What's up?
[210:47.43]What's that over there?
[210:48.99]Where?
[210:50.73]What is it?
[210:56.41]Oh, do it to me.
[210:58.21]What the?
[210:58.67]I can't get out of here.
[211:00.08]Oh, you idiot.
[211:03.14]Oh, I love this map.
[211:07.08]Let's go.
[211:07.74]There we go.
[211:13.82]Oh, I actually can't move.
[211:15.93]Honestly, probably better.
[211:17.79]Probably better that I can't move.
[211:20.60]This is actually probably a good place to be.
[211:23.96]For me.
[211:27.40]I just got hurt doing that.
[211:29.66]No, we're dead.
[211:30.38]It's over.
[211:31.36]We have nothing.
[211:33.60]We sell like... Wait, okay.
[211:36.02]If somebody dies, can we then like pick up their body and put it in there?
[211:42.06]I'm like stuck in here.
[211:43.98]I'm actually inside of this.
[211:45.41]Super stuck in it.
[211:49.07]This is gonna kill me, I guarantee it.
[211:54.01]Okay, what are you moving?
[211:55.38]Alright, I'm outta here.
[212:04.56]That was fun.
[212:10.09]If you guys continue to play, you're gonna have to play without your captain.
[212:15.25]Me.
[212:17.99]Where is everybody?
[212:19.19]Are we all half dead or something?
[212:21.19]We don't have any shovels.
[212:24.69]We don't have any bits.
[212:25.83]We're a bunch of guys with nothing.
[212:27.41]No bits.
[212:33.26]Oh, we're here.
[212:35.30]Jerry's... Jerry's gonna jump.
[212:39.03]No, Jerry!
[212:40.51]Jerry, no!
[212:41.19]No!
[212:42.87]Wait, Jerry didn't jump.
[212:44.35]Oh, Jerry jumped.
[212:45.07]Okay, Jerry jumped.
[212:46.91]Jerry jumped.
[212:47.49]I know you didn't jump.
[212:48.39]I only jumped to save you.
[212:50.66]Jerry jumped.
[212:53.58]Alright.
[212:53.80]So sad.
[212:54.72]Thanks for playing, everybody.
[212:55.90]If you guys want to keep playing, keep going.
[212:57.00]I'm gonna get dinner.
[212:58.32]I didn't know we were all killing ourselves.
[213:00.56]Next time, I'm gonna know how to play the game.
[213:03.12]You did great, Connor.
[213:04.76]Yeah, you did.
[213:06.50]I genuinely enjoyed putting the bees in front of that door, but I also enjoyed everything else we did tonight.
[213:12.19]It was great.
[213:12.73]Thank you.
[213:13.13]Me too.
[213:13.43]I got 9 XP now.
[213:15.56]What the fuck is he doing?
[213:17.89]I'm done.
[213:19.01]I don't know if you guys are done.
[213:22.83]My brain is kind of turned out.
[213:25.75]That was a lot of fun.
[213:27.47]Burned like the bridges.
[213:28.49]Good night, everyone.
[213:29.67]Thanks for playing.
[213:30.38]Bye.
[213:30.52]Bye, guys.
[213:31.94]See you later.
[213:34.02]Bye.
[213:34.24]You guys are the best.
[213:34.96]That's fun.
[213:46.29]Yeah, I think there's only, uh... There's only so much your brain can take.
[213:51.14]The 10-person Lethal Company is fun, but my brain is fried.
[213:56.58]It was fried like 30 minutes ago, 40 minutes ago.
[214:03.64]I did want to try that, though.
[214:05.42]That was something that a lot of people mentioned that, you know, it's like, hey, you can do the modded stuff.
[214:11.78]It's fun with like 5, 6, 7, 8, 10.
[214:12.74]I just wanted it to be chaos for a little bit.
[214:20.61]Ten people is... It's just so hard to pay attention to anything going on.
[214:32.76]When people were talking about, oh, no, no, no, yeah, do Lethal Company with the mods on, but don't ever go more than six people, I was like, why?
[214:40.70]Who gives a shit?
[214:42.02]And then we turned to ten Marios and Luigi's.
[214:50.71]But yeah, I want to talk about this for a brief minute.
[214:53.03]I talked about it early in the stream, but the Grotto Beasts sale is going on right now.
[215:02.76]Mods, can you give us a couple of links?
[215:05.46]The TTS, the Grotto Beasts TTS mod, tabletop simulator mod is also live on the Steam Workshop.
[215:21.44]And I believe the wiki should be as well.
[215:28.90]Go give it a try.
[215:29.90]There's gonna be a lot of patches added to it, so... But... What is there is really, really cool.
[215:37.54]So, those of you that care about it, those of you that want to play it, hopefully you enjoy it.
[215:48.33]You gonna play this again?
[215:50.02]Um, I don't know.
[215:50.98]Maybe.
[215:51.26]I could see you doing this again.
[215:56.80]It's just fun to just dick around with a bunch of people.
[216:00.94]I think I would want to do four again, though.
[216:04.08]My brain is so... It's so hard for me to pay attention in the first place.
[216:08.81]That once you cross that amount of people, my brain just... I can't.
[216:12.43]It's like, oh shit, where do I even go?
[216:14.27]Who do I follow?
[216:20.03]Still worth doing, though.
[216:20.78]Still worth trying.
[216:22.68]Good to see y'all.
[216:23.28]And plus, also, too, this is one of those games that a lot of people are playing and a lot of people want to play.
[216:28.38]So, just trying to get as, you know, many people in the lobby and just mess around for a few hours.
[216:39.33]And don't get me wrong, there was a shitload that happened today was hysterical.
[216:42.87]It was a lot of fun.
[216:44.10]So, that does not mean that this was not fun.
[216:52.84]When are we going to do Smurf Watch Party?
[216:58.40]Um... Yeah, I still haven't watched it.
[217:03.11]I need to watch it.
[217:13.35]Why do I care so much about watching the Smurfs?
[217:19.74]What about... Did you watch... No, I didn't watch that one either.
[217:26.18]Make sure to publish the VOD.
[217:27.18]I will.
[217:30.72]Alright, the next time you see me... Um, let's see.
[217:35.22]What are the Game Awards?
[217:41.44]When is that?
[217:41.88]7th?
[217:49.30]Let's plan on the 7th, and then you might see me before that.
[217:52.70]But I'll stream the Game Awards.
[217:54.46]That sounds fun.
[217:56.12]I've done it pretty much every year, so.
[218:08.95]Yeah.
[218:09.73]The 7th will be the next planned stream.
[218:12.59]And we'll see.
[218:13.19]Maybe it's just the 7th, and we do Game Awards and Hangout.
[218:15.39]Or I might do something else.
[218:17.39]But I would just count on the 7th.
[218:25.94]Show us your Spotify wrapped.
[218:28.92]Well, I have one problem there.
[218:31.42]I don't.
[218:32.50]I don't use Spotify.
[218:33.62]I've never opened it once in my entire life.
[218:35.82]Not in my entire life.
[218:39.12]So.
[218:40.62]I would need the program first.
[218:50.26]I just go to YouTube and type in, oh, this person's music.
[218:59.10]And I watch their just like official stuff that they have on YouTube.
[219:06.98]I don't like enough music and I don't have enough genres where Spotify makes sense to me.
[219:10.47]My Spotify playlist would be shuffling through the same eight songs.
[219:16.51]I don't listen to enough music for it to make sense.
[219:25.79]Alright.
[219:26.57]I'll see you guys later, at least on the 7th.
[219:30.31]Obviously, thanks to all the people that played.
[219:33.45]Good times, good times.
[219:34.79]Thanks for watching.
[219:35.45]And hey.
[219:41.60]Just saying.
[219:45.78]House Flipper 2, Invitational 2, is just getting started to get kind of worked on a little bit here.
[219:54.25]That's going to be fun.
[219:55.91]I'll see you later.
[220:00.21]See you soon.
[220:00.59]Take care of yourself.
[220:01.15]Call your mother.
[220:01.69]You know what to do.
[220:02.68]See you soon.
[220:06.42]See you at least on the 7th.
[220:12.55]Take care.
[220:13.23]Goodbye.
[220:13.77]Good night.
[220:47.67]Thank you.
