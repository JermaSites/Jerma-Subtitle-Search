[ve:60.16.100]

[00:31.13]Well, hello there.
[00:32.67]Hi.
[00:34.77]My name's Jeremy.
[00:35.67]Welcome to my favorite part of the day.
[00:38.75]Where I turn on my broadcast.
[00:41.00]And I broadcast something.
[00:43.58]Reminds me when I was 12.
[00:46.84]And I broadcasted on a funny school play I was in.
[00:50.73]I was a radio announcer.
[00:52.67]Finally addressing my dreams of being a caster.
[00:56.96]Hey!
[00:57.86]So, welcome.
[00:59.44]We have a special stream tonight.
[01:00.78]This is going to be a very special stream.
[01:03.39]We have a very, very interesting thing planned, me and Italics.
[01:06.83]Tonight, we're going to do something called the Beat the Game Challenge.
[01:10.91]And how the Beat the Game Challenge works is whether me or, you know, me and Italics, our co-op partner, we find a game and we have to beat the whole thing on stream in one stream.
[01:21.33]And, well, hey, hey, hey, that's very interesting, but there's a stipulation on that.
[01:25.18]We have to beat the whole game in four hours.
[01:27.52]And we're gonna have a timer on the screen.
[01:29.68]And gotta beat the fucking whole game in four hours, and there are other stipulations.
[01:33.76]There are more things to talk about, but I'm gonna wait till we get to italics.
[01:39.32]Yeah, beat the game on stream in one stream.
[01:41.76]It's very important.
[01:45.61]Now, you'll see why it's gonna be a little bit more difficult for us.
[01:50.19]Is it a drinking game?
[01:51.47]No, not technically.
[01:53.81]You can make it one if you want, if you're of legal drinking age, but yes.
[01:59.82]Spoiler alert, they're gonna fail.
[02:02.50]Don't say that.
[02:04.68]Don't say that!
[02:07.20]First of all, two very important things I need to say here.
[02:11.87]First, pay no attention to me about to be talking.
[02:16.94]Because you're gonna hear, you're gonna hear like an ad probably.
[02:20.12]There is no option.
[02:26.55]for anything besides this iPad to show the chat, because we cannot have this game run in a window, no matter what.
[02:33.63]Me and Italics tried to make this fucking dumb Kane and Lynch game run in a window, or run in any borderless, no, doesn't matter, DXWin doesn't do it, DXWND doesn't do it, it's impossible.
[02:44.30]So I have my iPad here to read the chat, because I'm not gonna be able to see my other screen.
[02:50.30]So just keep that in mind.
[02:54.64]And when Italics gets in here, I'm really early.
[02:57.70]I told you I was gonna be late.
[02:58.64]I told you I was gonna be really late.
[03:03.08]What happens if I don't do it in time?
[03:05.42]I mean, you'll see.
[03:06.70]You'll see.
[03:07.26]Just wait.
[03:08.06]Me and Italics will explain everything accordingly.
[03:10.40]Just waiting for people to trickle in and waiting for Italics to start his stream.
[03:16.21]iPad chat for the win.
[03:17.37]Yeah.
[03:18.23]You guys are to the bottom left of my screen here.
[03:24.09]This might take, like, four hours.
[03:25.89]This might take, like, seven.
[03:27.37]I don't know.
[03:30.79]Am I gonna eat a sock if I don't win?
[03:32.20]No, that's fucking disgusting.
[03:33.58]Why would I eat a sock if I'm gonna lose?
[03:38.94]So, um, let me just make sure this is all set.
[03:43.20]Move this over.
[03:45.56]Got about one minute left until Talix is gonna be ready to go.
[03:50.97]And we will call him in here.
[03:52.32]And he is streaming as well.
[03:53.36]He's streaming his side.
[03:54.20]I have to explain what happens.
[04:03.22]This game is four hours at a normal pace.
[04:05.00]This is not a difficult challenge.
[04:06.86]See, you don't know that yet.
[04:08.36]Because you don't know the stipulations of the four-hour challenge.
[04:12.40]It's very important.
[04:18.31]Does corn grow on trees during a movie?
[04:19.99]What?
[04:20.37]No, there's no bed.
[04:21.19]We're not bedding anything.
[04:21.97]There's no bed.
[04:22.45]It's just a challenge.
[04:26.73]It's not just a four-hour timer.
[04:29.37]There's other shit involved.
[04:32.47]You know, if I get killed, I gotta eat a can of dog food.
[04:37.22]No, I'm not doing that.
[04:38.06]That's a joke.
[04:38.50]That's not gonna happen.
[04:42.06]It's a gimmick stream.
[04:42.76]This is a gimmick stream, and hopefully it works, because otherwise we're just gonna be playing a shitty game for four hours.
[04:49.09]So without further ado, let's bring Italics in without further ado.
[04:51.73]Italics, are you here?
[04:56.50]Do we have Italics located in our... Hey, yes, we do.
[05:02.32]Yes, we do.
[05:03.46]We absolutely do.
[05:04.74]So everyone say hi to Italics.
[05:05.90]Welcome him to the stream.
[05:08.00]Thanks.
[05:08.72]Everyone say hi to Jeremy.
[05:09.80]Welcome him to the stream.
[05:10.54]We're going to go ahead and do this, get this ready to go.
[05:15.84]And, well, would you look at that.
[05:20.98]Shall we explain what's going to happen?
[05:24.18]We shall.
[05:24.84]It is going to be a time speedrun challenge.
[05:29.29]Time speedrun challenge.
[05:32.33]We'll elaborate on that.
[05:33.23]Like I said previously, we have four hours to beat this whole game on one stream.
[05:37.05]No double streams.
[05:38.51]We're not going to come back tomorrow and do this again.
[05:40.89]We have to beat the whole game tonight.
[05:41.83]This is one stream only.
[05:43.15]yeah and uh by the way a very important to note uh every uh every unsuccessful joke that is made during the course of the stream uh you deduct 15 seconds from the clock every death one of us goes down and one of us dies we deduct 30 seconds a successful joke will gain us 10 seconds
[06:06.79]So as you can tell, like we need to get... I know we just listed the rules, like you just listed them, but I would like to offer some changes to the rules.
[06:16.25]You want to add some changes to the rules.
[06:17.42]Okay.
[06:17.88]Yeah.
[06:18.86]Considering the program we're going to be using does not have increments of 15 and 30.
[06:24.38]Oh, well, that's important.
[06:25.26]We may want to change that to maybe like one minute.
[06:28.80]All right.
[06:29.24]One minute.
[06:30.16]One minute.
[06:30.58]No, two minutes for a bad joke because they're not going to be any.
[06:33.37]I'm confident.
[06:34.01]Well, minus two minutes for every bad joke, plus two minutes for every good joke.
[06:39.75]You understand?
[06:41.99]Minus two minutes for every bad joke, plus two minutes for a good joke.
[06:47.57]And by the way, so what about for deaths?
[06:49.74]Minus one minute for a death?
[06:53.62]Uh...
[06:54.75]Do we have anything worthy of a five-minute detractor?
[06:57.78]Like, what would be the most grievous thing we could do?
[07:00.96]If a joke is so bad that, like, it's not even close to being funny, then we'll dock down five minutes.
[07:08.48]But, remember, if we slay it, if, like, one of us slays a joke, bang, we get plus five minutes.
[07:16.07]Seems fair.
[07:16.57]By the way, if we have four hours, that's the total time.
[07:20.47]Total time allowed.
[07:21.11]Yeah.
[07:22.51]So we're starting the timer at four hours.
[07:24.45]Yeah.
[07:24.77]All right.
[07:25.07]So let's just make sure the game works.
[07:27.64]That's important, right?
[07:30.22]So let's get over there.
[07:32.84]And that is an important thing.
[07:35.09]This is a game from 2010.
[07:37.97]Don't ask me why we're doing Kane and Lynch 2 dog days.
[07:43.28]But we are.
[07:43.74]Dog days.
[07:47.24]Shall we just go?
[07:48.20]We're going to go.
[07:50.08]No, we start the timer when we get in the game.
[07:53.34]No, but we can't... Yeah, but as soon as we push... Because we can't not count the first cutscene and count all the other cutscenes, right?
[08:01.95]That's true.
[08:03.39]We'll start from the first cutscene.
[08:04.65]We're going to get a 1, 2, 3, go, okay?
[08:05.49]Okay.
[08:07.63]Okay, so it's kind of more difficult for me than it is for you.
[08:10.67]Because I've got to push the start game button and start the timer.
[08:17.30]We'll just get in there and we'll get it off tap at the same time.
[08:20.72]We'll do it during the first cutscene.
[08:22.20]Yeah, during the first cutscene, okay?
[08:24.10]Alright.
[08:24.86]This is important.
[08:25.52]We have to- we have to do this thing.
[08:27.14]Because we cannot get access to our other monitors.
[08:29.68]This game is so old and there was no such thing as a fucking borderless window back in the day.
[08:35.40]There's not even regular windowed mode.
[08:37.69]No.
[08:38.79]And this is on medium.
[08:40.25]Yeah, this is on medium.
[08:42.19]This is on medium just like my favorite kind of steak.
[08:44.43]Medium.
[08:45.45]Uh, excuse me.
[08:46.01]Uh, excuse me.
[08:48.77]Uh... I think that's two minutes.
[08:52.53]I think that's plus two minutes.
[08:54.74]Plus two?
[08:55.30]Yeah, that's plus two minutes.
[08:56.08]Or minus two?
[08:56.56]No, that's plus two.
[08:57.36]That's plus two.
[08:57.90]That's a fucking... That is a timely, medium-rare steak joke.
[09:02.09]That's plus two minutes.
[09:02.91]Oh, I thought you were just saying two minutes because we're not playing on easy.
[09:06.17]No, no, no.
[09:06.49]We're not playing on easy.
[09:08.13]Minus two minutes.
[09:09.47]Minus two minutes.
[09:10.09]We're not playing on easy.
[09:11.29]I can understand that.
[09:13.27]So we're back down.
[09:14.15]We've evened out.
[09:15.23]It's Alex and Greg are about to... Yeah, it's Alex and Greg.
[09:22.78]Are you guys ready?
[09:24.83]So I, we have to like, okay, honestly, like without like fucking around or joking around.
[09:30.38]No jokes.
[09:31.16]We have to like alt tab at the same time.
[09:33.20]So our streams freeze at the same time, you know?
[09:35.54]Oh yeah.
[09:36.00]Cause it's going to freeze the cut scene.
[09:37.28]It's going to freeze the cut scene.
[09:38.28]Okay.
[09:39.13]All right, listen, how about this?
[09:40.19]How about this instead?
[09:40.97]We just take the, like, 10 seconds it's gonna take for us to start the timer before we push ready.
[09:47.17]Okay.
[09:47.27]How about that?
[09:47.73]All right, so let's just, like, alt-tab.
[09:49.73]Let's just start the timer now.
[09:51.61]No, no, no, no, no.
[09:52.51]Wait, wait.
[09:53.19]Okay, wait, wait.
[09:53.89]Ready?
[09:54.75]You wanna start the timer right now?
[09:56.25]We're gonna start the timer right now.
[09:57.33]We're gonna count it down.
[09:58.07]Okay, we're gonna count it down.
[09:58.85]When I say go, like, it's gonna be 3, 2, 1, go.
[10:02.07]3, 2, 1, bang.
[10:03.43]Wait, no, no, no, no, no.
[10:04.68]I didn't, I didn't.
[10:05.22]Okay.
[10:05.52]Okay.
[10:07.67]Are we on three or are we on bang?
[10:09.85]We're on four minutes.
[10:10.82]We're gonna go on bang.
[10:12.44]Okay, so you do it.
[10:13.52]All right.
[10:15.00]Three, two, one, bang.
[10:17.19]It starts.
[10:18.65]Wait, it didn't start!
[10:19.47]Mine didn't start!
[10:20.11]It's okay!
[10:20.51]It's alright!
[10:20.91]Reset it!
[10:21.39]Reset it!
[10:21.73]Reset it!
[10:22.29]Oh, shit!
[10:23.25]Hold on, wait!
[10:24.29]Wait, that's a... Wait, wait, wait!
[10:27.55]Pause it!
[10:27.87]Pause it!
[10:28.15]Pause it!
[10:28.95]Alright, reset it.
[10:29.59]Get it back.
[10:30.05]Okay, I pressed the green button.
[10:31.63]I didn't press... That's the start button.
[10:33.59]Yeah, it's the one that says start.
[10:35.53]Okay, I pressed the green button.
[10:37.07]Are you ready?
[10:37.51]That green just means ready.
[10:39.07]Okay.
[10:39.19]Alright, are you ready?
[10:42.51]We're ready.
[10:43.13]Okay, count me down.
[10:44.14]Three, two, one, bang.
[10:46.70]Okay, we're going.
[10:48.09]Get us a mic.
[10:49.57]Did you notice anything strange about the timer?
[10:52.19]What's strange about the timer?
[10:54.19]It skipped the first minute.
[10:56.15]Alright, we'll make a bad joke, quick.
[11:00.08]Hey, knock knock.
[11:00.94]Alright, no, we're going.
[11:02.94]Go, go, just go, go.
[11:04.30]Just pretend we just made a bad joke.
[11:05.68]Minus one minute.
[11:07.96]I can't alt-tab, it's like loading the cutscene.
[11:11.06]We're not doing minus minutes.
[11:12.06]Just wait a minute, we're not doing any minus minutes.
[11:13.86]We already lost a minute.
[11:16.88]Yeah.
[11:18.06]There's no reason to push the button.
[11:19.46]We already lost one.
[11:20.22]Alright, here we go.
[11:21.36]Cutscene.
[11:23.75]I'm afraid to say anything.
[11:26.91]I'm actually afraid to say anything.
[11:30.19]I don't want everyone to take away minutes from us.
[11:34.43]I know.
[11:35.42]I don't want to have minutes removed already.
[11:37.16]It's too early for that.
[11:38.22]It's too early for minutes to be removed.
[11:39.80]And what is it?
[11:40.18]Five minutes?
[11:45.37]Wait, can we get plus two?
[11:47.51]Just for selecting the game.
[11:48.56]Yeah, just because that was like a kind of funny joke.
[11:55.60]Wait, is it nudity in this game?
[11:57.16]Plus 20 minutes for nudity.
[11:59.16]No, mine is... Oh, God.
[12:00.14]Wait, is there actually nudity?
[12:01.86]No, I think there is nudity, but it's like the Sims censored.
[12:05.62]Oh, okay.
[12:06.84]Well, we got some stream buffering.
[12:09.33]Stream buffering hey guys watch out.
[12:11.25]That's that I'll tap I'll tap all that that that's plus two minute That's plus two minutes That's a pretty that's a great fucking stream joke you just made How long are we at a hundred percent?
[12:23.66]I just
[12:35.96]I'm sorry.
[12:37.00]It was a habit.
[12:37.68]It said press anything to skip, and I pushed it.
[12:39.84]Alright, so remember, if one of us dies, we lose five minutes, right?
[12:43.92]We lose five minutes.
[12:44.82]Okay, die, lose five minutes.
[12:46.32]Bad joke, minus two minutes.
[12:47.56]Good joke.
[12:47.95]If we make it through a whole level without dying, we should get at least just five?
[12:53.67]You want to stop at five for a whole level with no deaths?
[12:57.15]Yeah, camera shake is off.
[12:58.33]Don't worry.
[12:58.75]I ain't doing that shit.
[13:03.36]Not in cutscenes, though.
[13:05.97]No.
[13:06.49]Why is the screen shaking?
[13:08.79]This was the Jason Bourne era of video games.
[13:12.41]I know.
[13:12.65]That wasn't a joke.
[13:13.51]We don't have to add any minutes.
[13:15.11]No, it's actually true.
[13:17.29]The last Bourne was 2007.
[13:18.05]They hired a fucking cameraman off Craigslist.
[13:24.77]That wasn't a joke.
[13:25.43]That was just a statement.
[13:27.39]It was just a fact.
[13:29.39]It was just a fact.
[13:35.09]So which one of mine?
[13:35.99]Is that guy naked?
[13:37.59]I think you're the one on the right.
[13:39.43]Okay.
[13:40.31]Which one is Kane and which one is Lynch?
[13:42.75]I think you're the one holding the camera.
[13:45.48]Wait, I'm the cameraman?
[13:47.38]Who's the third player then?
[13:50.32]Minus two?
[13:51.76]What do you mean minus two?
[13:53.36]Wait, nudity is minus 20 minutes this thing.
[14:00.48]We lose time.
[14:01.98]Apparently, if there's nudity, it's minus 20 minutes.
[14:03.74]I thought that was something people wanted to see, so would that be more time?
[14:06.59]But that's dangerous for us as streamers, so if there's nudity, it's minus 20 minutes.
[14:10.33]Right, the stream gets shorter because admins come in.
[14:13.03]Right, okay, so nudity is minus 20 minutes.
[14:19.03]Make sure you get a close-up of that, uh, game.
[14:21.75]Make sure you, uh, okay, here we go, here we go, we're good.
[14:24.21]Here we go.
[14:27.01]Which one?
[14:27.99]You only have one eye.
[14:29.39]Yeah, this is Kane and Lynch 2.
[14:31.88]I have two eyes, what are you talking about?
[14:33.40]No, you've only got one eye.
[14:34.68]I have two eyes.
[14:35.82]No, you have one good eye.
[14:37.26]I have two eyes.
[14:38.86]No, look at your eyes.
[14:39.74]Look at them.
[14:41.32]Yeah, but do you remember in the first game, he got, like, fucking stabbed or something?
[14:44.33]Did you ever play the first game?
[14:45.81]No.
[14:46.49]What year was it, like 2005?
[14:47.65]Alright, we gotta go!
[14:48.93]We're up a fucking stream challenge, dude!
[14:50.87]Let's go!
[14:51.19]Oh yeah, we only got like three hours.
[14:52.05]We only got like three minutes!
[14:53.07]Kick it open!
[14:54.33]Nudity!
[14:54.93]Alright, that's minus 20 minutes!
[14:56.47]Alt-tab!
[14:57.13]Alt-tab!
[14:57.53]Minus 5, 10, 15, 20.
[15:00.69]God damn it!
[15:03.19]Nudity!
[15:03.75]15, 20.
[15:05.41]Coming back in.
[15:07.09]I'm in.
[15:07.92]The same nudity doesn't count twice.
[15:09.32]No, the same nudity doesn't.
[15:10.12]No double jeopardy.
[15:10.88]No double jeopardy.
[15:11.54]The same nudity doesn't count twice.
[15:12.58]Alright, let's go!
[15:15.31]What am I doing?
[15:16.03]Press Y?
[15:16.79]Press Y. Y. Catch him alive.
[15:19.35]Who the fuck is this guy?
[15:21.45]We gotta catch Brady alive.
[15:23.46]Catch him alive.

[17:11.81]What's this 20 minute timer?
[17:13.23]Was that 20 hours?
[17:14.65]No, that's distance.
[17:15.55]It's meters.
[17:16.31]Alright, do we... How do we climb over shit?
[17:22.16]He possesses a skill that we do not.
[17:24.42]We can't climb over things?
[17:26.22]This is before you could jump in video games.
[17:27.90]Oh my god, give me a break.
[17:29.50]Where's he going?
[17:29.94]Down?
[17:30.14]How do we get down?
[17:32.60]Um, there's gotta be a climb button.
[17:34.78]Why can't we jump?
[17:37.24]There's gotta be a climb button.
[17:38.16]Fucking Kane and Lynch 2 dog diarrhea.

[17:49.51]Is there like a hotkeys button?
[17:50.97]I don't think so.
[17:52.15]Key configuration.
[17:53.94]Wait, oh, I got it, I got it.
[17:55.02]Hold C, hold C.
[17:57.90]It's like you have to take cover and then... You have to hold W and C after taking cover.

[18:44.06]Very animated.
[18:44.90]Okay, that was so, that was graceful what that guy just did.
[18:48.86]Okay, we're good.
[18:50.23]Just a reminder, this is medium mode.
[18:52.37]No, no, I didn't die, guys.
[18:54.11]No, I know.
[18:54.77]So it's not minus five minutes.
[18:56.17]I didn't die.

[19:06.97]I'm fine.
[19:07.41]I'm not even dead.

[19:12.14]Okay, I got to pick up a weapon.
[19:13.84]Oh, they've got the good guns.
[19:15.90]Apparently that counts.
[19:17.18]How does that count?
[19:18.38]No, it doesn't.
[19:19.22]We didn't have to reload checkpoint.
[19:22.00]That guy was useless.
[19:25.00]What's so important about this guy?
[19:28.40]Nothing.
[19:29.54]It's the principle.
[19:32.18]I'm not going to lie.
[19:33.43]Gunplay is not bad for 2010.
[19:38.45]That was so dope.
[19:43.91]Oh, wait.
[19:44.13]Wait, wait, wait.

[20:20.55]I'll tap.
[20:21.03]I'll tap.
[20:21.39]That's plus four minutes.
[20:22.62]That's a double joke.
[20:24.54]One, two, three, four.
[20:26.52]Plus four.
[20:28.22]One, two, three, four.
[20:29.84]We've got three hours 40 to beat the whole game.
[20:33.30]We've got a long time.
[20:34.54]So you're down?
[20:35.57]Yeah, I'm down.
[20:36.33]Hang on, I can do it.
[20:37.79]I'm up.
[20:38.79]I was down, now I'm up.
[20:41.13]That doesn't make any sense.
[20:42.05]It is the naked guy again.
[20:43.17]And this guy lost his pants.
[20:44.70]He was waiting for us.
[20:46.28]Are you noticing the fact that this guy lost his pants in this somehow?
[20:50.48]Is that a bad guy?
[20:50.94]I don't know.
[20:52.40]It's the...
[20:56.79]It's easy.
[20:57.87]Just push people and they die.
[21:01.44]Easy, easy.
[21:08.22]I love how you just pick people up and throw them down and they're done.
[21:14.57]That doesn't make any sense.
[21:18.77]I just like, okay, I'm going to make a joke here.
[21:20.63]Let's see.
[21:20.93]I don't know how good this is going to be.
[21:23.10]What's, uh, what's that guy?
[21:24.64]The fucking, uh, death.
[21:25.87]I'm just like, that's minus two minutes.
[21:28.93]That's minus two minutes.
[21:30.79]What?
[21:31.05]I tried to make a joke about death.
[21:32.17]Like, I touch people and they die.
[21:33.27]Minus two minutes.
[21:33.85]That was awful.
[21:35.37]What are you, Suicide Squad?
[21:36.77]I mean, that was just awful.
[21:39.45]I was trying to make, like, the I'm death, I touch people and they die.
[21:41.70]That's fucking minus.
[21:42.22]So how many minutes did we lose?
[21:43.04]That's minus two minutes.
[21:44.64]Okay.
[21:45.38]You just made the katana joke.
[21:48.32]What katana joke?
[21:49.58]Did you see Suicide Squad?
[21:50.60]What?
[21:51.18]Well, that's minus two minutes again, by the way.
[21:52.52]That was awful.
[21:54.50]One, two, down.
[21:55.78]Minus two minutes, Dalek.
[21:56.52]I was talking about your joke.
[21:58.52]Yeah, but then you made a joke about Katana, which is minus two minutes.
[22:00.44]No, I wasn't joking.
[22:01.44]That was how bad your joke was.
[22:02.80]I was comparing it to suicide.
[22:03.98]But then that joke about how bad my joke was was a minus two minute joke.
[22:07.48]Okay.
[22:09.40]So we're all in agreement.
[22:10.46]A Suicide Squad reference is automatically minus two minutes.
[22:14.53]That's just not automatic.
[22:16.59]Regardless of quality.
[22:19.00]Good thing we got that plus four with that awesome fucking double joke.
[22:21.30]All right, where are we going?
[22:23.06]Just acknowledging its existence.
[22:25.42]Minus five minutes.
[22:28.51]I don't know.
[22:28.81]It's 30 meters in this direction.
[22:30.87]How are we supposed to get over there?
[22:31.91]I don't understand.
[22:32.53]I don't know.
[22:35.17]I wasn't watching the towel guy when I was supposed to be.
[22:40.23]God damn it.
[22:41.43]We're like on a timer.
[22:42.55]It's the first level.
[22:43.97]Wait, can we do anything this way?
[22:45.41]We're going to spend three hours here.
[22:49.68]It's got to be through here.
[22:51.12]Hang on.
[22:51.34]It's got to be through here.
[22:52.06]I'm just going to take my anger out.
[22:53.94]No, that's wrong.
[22:55.70]Do you find it?
[22:56.50]This looks breakable.
[22:58.01]Is it breakable?
[22:59.41]Can we climb it?
[23:02.05]It's ice.
[23:02.45]Has anybody been watching what we're supposed to be doing?
[23:05.79]Where are we supposed to go?
[23:06.71]This is a stream challenge.
[23:07.83]Beat the game challenge.
[23:09.09]We need some help.
[23:09.51]We need to know where the fuck we're going.
[23:12.22]Okay, we were definitely running this direction that we're going right now.
[23:15.26]Yes, we were.
[23:16.30]He went past the van.
[23:18.46]He's 20 meters that way.
[23:20.83]There's nothing we can grab?
[23:24.73]Don't give them any hints.
[23:27.81]Don't worry.
[23:28.11]We're going to make a bunch of solid jokes in the next fucking few minutes.
[23:31.69]Yeah, we just have to get out of the empty fish market first.
[23:35.66]Maybe we should go this way?
[23:37.90]Getting lost in the very first level is minus five minutes at least.
[23:42.76]I think so too.
[23:44.88]Yeah, this is just a sad display.
[23:47.06]Minus five minutes.
[23:49.44]I mean, this is a sad display.
[23:51.76]Minus five.
[23:52.98]Are we live streamers?
[23:54.16]Are we video game players?
[23:55.08]By the way, we didn't mention this.
[23:56.50]When the timer runs out, the stream's over.
[23:58.00]Yeah, when the timer runs out, the stream ends, regardless of where we are.
[24:01.02]Yeah.
[24:01.54]Man should have mentioned that earlier.
[24:03.21]We probably should have mentioned that.
[24:11.61]Why did we not go this way before?
[24:13.39]What do you mean, what way?
[24:14.61]This is the way.
[24:15.29]This is the way.
[24:15.67]Okay, good.
[24:16.27]Yeah, we found it.
[24:18.97]There's more nudity.
[24:20.23]There is more nudity.
[24:21.27]Oh, is this seriously?
[24:22.05]No, no, no.
[24:22.69]I just saw another Sims.
[24:25.49]Hey, wait, wait, wait.
[24:26.31]We got a potential Joker attack.
[24:27.55]We got to nail this one to get some time back.
[24:28.76]We do.
[24:29.44]Yeah, we do.
[24:29.68]All right, so I'm going to throw the fuel can.
[24:30.70]You're going to shoot it in midair.
[24:31.72]What are you doing?
[24:32.80]Go ahead.
[24:34.06]You're going to throw in midair.
[24:34.84]I'm going to shoot mine.
[24:35.66]No, I know.
[24:36.06]I'm going to shoot yours.
[24:36.56]All right, you're going to shoot mine.
[24:37.40]I'm going to throw mine.
[24:38.20]So I'm going to throw it out.
[24:38.84]I'm going to tell you.
[24:39.36]One, two, three, throw.
[24:40.18]And then, bang, you're going to shoot it.
[24:41.90]Hilarious joke.
[24:43.60]Okay.
[24:44.02]One, two, three, get it.
[24:54.06]Pause it.
[24:55.83]Hold on.
[24:56.81]Let's think about this for a second.
[24:57.83]It was five minutes per death.
[24:59.53]So that's five ten.
[25:01.23]It was a failure of a joke.
[25:02.65]That's a minus two minutes.
[25:03.65]It was a good joke.
[25:05.11]It was a good joke.
[25:05.73]I don't know.
[25:06.41]It was minus ten minutes plus two minutes.
[25:08.65]So minus eight minutes.
[25:10.42]Minus eight.
[25:11.38]Okay.
[25:11.96]So we're doing minus eight minutes.
[25:13.44]We're doing minus eight.
[25:14.14]That's five, six, seven, eight.
[25:17.36]Okay.
[25:19.80]Yeah.
[25:20.50]Okay.
[25:20.68]Let's go.
[25:21.60]Okay.
[25:23.70]Okay.
[25:25.21]Got it out of my system.
[25:25.91]You got it out?
[25:26.85]You didn't do it right.
[25:28.35]It was not correct, but it's okay.
[25:31.67]This time, let's try it again.
[25:33.17]So this time, I make it work the way that it's supposed to be done.
[25:35.69]And one... Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[25:40.07]I want to make the explosion bigger.
[25:41.19]So I'm going to throw mine.
[25:42.75]Throw yours preemptively.
[25:43.71]Get it out there.
[25:44.17]All right.
[25:45.71]And then get ready.
[25:47.47]I'm going to throw it high.
[25:48.37]I'm ready.
[25:49.21]One, two, three.
[25:53.21]I mean, that... That was the plan.
[25:56.15]I know, but that wasn't... But he's dead.
[25:58.67]So it worked.
[25:59.87]That wasn't... That's minus two minutes.
[26:02.21]I thought that was just... We were just playing skillfully.
[26:04.92]No, we were trying to make it funny.
[26:07.32]I mean, that's true.
[26:08.16]What do you guys think?
[26:08.88]Minus two minutes?
[26:09.94]Yeah, I'm seeing a lot of... Yeah, minus two.
[26:11.60]I'm seeing a lot of minus twos.
[26:15.47]Yeah.
[26:16.85]Alright, minus two.
[26:18.25]I love how it's telling me left mouse button shoots.
[26:21.33]It was funny the first time.
[26:22.19]Yeah, we tried it again.
[26:23.19]And that's when you try to do the same joke.
[26:25.93]Yeah, we got an opportunity here.
[26:30.89]They're not going to shoot.
[26:31.83]Italics, opportunity to get time back.
[26:33.09]Get over here.
[26:34.41]Hold on.
[26:35.39]Italics again.
[26:39.13]I'm tapping E quickly.
[26:41.67]I'm fucking dead.
[26:42.87]I'm dead.
[26:43.51]I lose.
[26:44.05]Did you die too?
[26:44.71]Yeah.
[26:45.89]Oh, god damn it.
[26:46.95]I was already dead.
[26:48.46]Minus 10 minutes.
[26:50.43]No, I think I don't think we could keep doing ten minutes.
[26:53.73]I mean like then stop dying and When we complete a level we gain alright when we complete a level we gain five minutes, is that okay?
[27:02.64]We have to get more than five Leading the level.
[27:05.24]All right, we get ten minutes for completing a level The stream is gonna be like 40 minutes long.
[27:12.06]It's gonna be like a 30 minute stream.
[27:13.86]All right, let's actually fucking play
[27:20.05]People already lost an hour.
[27:22.87]Did you throw a grenade, or was that a fuel can?
[27:24.55]That was a fuel can.
[27:25.47]Alright, so let's bait out the cars, and then I'm coming back around.
[27:28.49]Get back around.
[27:30.76]And then do the fuel can again.
[27:31.88]Okay, this is an opportunity to get, like, a lot of people here.
[27:37.34]Don't shoot that.
[27:37.98]There are a lot of people here.
[27:38.84]Just back it up.
[27:39.28]Back it up.
[27:39.70]Get over here.
[27:42.32]Are you okay?

[27:55.16]Alright, just be tactical about this shit.
[27:56.90]No, don't shoot that.

[28:24.30]Hang on, I'm picking up ammo.
[28:25.40]You gotta get ammo.
[28:26.38]25 minutes.
[28:26.58]I'm not supposed to kill this guy, right?
[28:29.16]The one that you're chasing?
[28:32.15]Alright, I'm coming.
[28:33.17]I think we got him.
[28:33.61]I'm there.
[28:34.09]Yeah, we got him.
[28:34.91]We win.
[28:36.57]Is this the end of the level?
[28:37.25]You get plus 10 minutes.
[28:40.57]Nudity doesn't count, it's the same nudity.
[28:42.03]The same nudity.
[28:44.77]She's not even nude.
[28:45.39]She's wearing clothing.
[28:46.09]Who's going to get the... Okay.
[28:51.93]Well, that was... That was a big chase.
[28:55.67]Why did he run for that long to do that?
[28:57.99]Why didn't we shoot him in the kneecap?
[28:59.57]I don't... Why... Why did he run?
[29:14.59]He could have just done that at the start.
[29:15.69]Okay, for a second, I thought that was his nudity.
[29:17.15]I thought that was on his body.
[29:20.53]All right.
[29:21.99]I think that's plus 10 minutes, right?
[29:23.61]Yeah, he's here.
[29:24.51]It should be plus 10, yeah.
[29:25.83]Let's wait till we buffer because we don't want to make it a potential crash situation.
[29:28.75]We don't want to mess up the bit rate.
[29:30.50]Yeah.
[29:30.64]Didn't get the first melee kill.
[29:32.26]Melee, sorry.
[29:34.38]How do you even do a melee kill?
[29:43.52]We don't get an hour for completing a level.
[29:46.78]That would be a huge reward.
[29:48.38]That would be way too big of a reward.
[29:49.88]Maybe the joke is there's only two levels.
[29:53.40]That is true.
[29:54.85]Because this is supposed to be like a really short game.
[29:59.59]I mean, I feel like we're losing time here for no reason.
[30:01.59]What the fuck is this?
[30:05.05]No, sorry, if the game crashes, we get plus 20 minutes, okay?
[30:08.29]Because that's bullshit.
[30:09.27]Because that's putting us in a bad position, you know?
[30:11.75]That's not a good position to be in.
[30:14.60]Okay, so, ready?
[30:16.76]Alt-tab?
[30:18.50]That is a 10 minute.
[30:19.62]We get plus 10 minutes.
[30:21.54]Alright, 10 minutes added to the clock.
[30:23.64]We're good, I'm back in.
[30:31.59]I love how it says in the lower left, that's like, as if that's a person on the team talking.
[30:39.51]That's a Ubisoft trailer.
[30:42.60]Sorry, who remembers watching the Animaniacs?
[30:44.66]Talix, you remember the Animaniacs, right?
[30:49.00]Yeah.
[30:50.90]That was the silent crash.
[30:56.07]Wait, why is my screen nudity?
[30:59.12]Was your screen just nudity for a second?
[31:00.59]My screen was censored.
[31:01.63]I had nudity screen.
[31:02.63]What did this come from?
[31:04.13]What the fuck is going on?
[31:06.95]Yeah, but why is it like Armageddon?
[31:08.87]What is naked over here?
[31:09.67]Hold on, hold on a minute.
[31:10.76]This is important.
[31:11.20]Who is naked?
[31:11.88]This guy's face is naked.
[31:26.52]Look, I'm trying to protect you right now, okay?
[31:28.42]Because some of us don't want to lose time.
[31:31.26]Dude, this guy's face is naked.
[31:35.11]Why is his face blurred?
[31:39.57]Oh, this guy.
[31:41.91]This guy was so ugly, they can't even show his face.
[31:47.76]And he has a... Wait, this guy has a mask on.
[31:53.94]Why would they blur out a guy who has a mask on already?
[31:56.72]His face is already being blurred.
[32:00.32]Oh my god, that's fucking funny.
[32:01.84]That's plus two minutes.
[32:04.21]When you get a chance, Talix, add two minutes.
[32:08.17]Two minutes, huh?
[32:08.81]That was, like, that was fucking funny.
[32:11.99]Blurring out a guy with a mask on.
[32:13.37]They're blurring his face out.
[32:15.55]As if... Hang on, I gotta...
[32:22.47]This is so stupid.
[32:24.73]I'm so glad we decided to play this.
[32:27.14]Hey, by the way, our guy is just driving up, like, every so often.
[32:34.16]How did he get there, though?
[32:35.32]He's driving up, like, really slowly.
[32:38.04]Who's in the car with this guy?
[32:40.50]Wait, I thought it was me and you driving this guy.
[32:45.15]Where's this guy shooting me from?
[32:45.97]What?
[32:46.15]Cameraman was in the backseat.
[32:47.85]That's the only thing I know.
[32:49.43]Is this the cameraman?
[32:50.39]Like in the... driving the car?
[32:54.83]Look at his face!
[32:58.47]Wait!
[32:58.74]He just ran us over.
[32:59.90]He just ran us over.
[33:00.68]What a fucking idiot.
[33:02.20]We're okay.
[33:02.76]Alright, he's just moving.
[33:03.84]Friendly fire.
[33:04.20]I wish he would stop.
[33:05.98]Oh my god!
[33:06.86]Jesus Christ!
[33:07.82]I'm gonna die.
[33:10.90]I'm gonna die.
[33:11.66]No, I'm not.
[33:12.34]I'm okay.
[33:12.62]No, you're fine.
[33:13.06]You're fine.

[33:46.11]We gotta move up with the car.
[33:46.85]I've been picking up some sweet guns.
[33:48.73]The car is way too far down.
[33:50.01]He looks very low on health.
[33:50.85]Oh, my God.
[33:52.99]High behind the gas tank.
[33:56.39]Uh-oh.
[33:58.13]What?
[33:59.12]How is... Leave him alone.
[34:00.62]Why is the accuracy so bad?
[34:03.40]This guy's still... Okay, we're good.
[34:09.47]Just had to, you know, just had to throw him to the concrete.
[34:11.85]Alright, I think we're good.
[34:15.93]Watch out.
[34:16.25]Is this a bad guy?
[34:16.95]Um... Oh, this car just... What the fuck?
[34:25.64]Why did that happen?
[34:26.66]Wait, we have to get him out of the car?
[34:28.24]We have to pull this guy out of the car.
[34:30.38]The one I just shot?
[34:31.68]Are you shooting this guy?
[34:32.66]Hang on, I'll protect you.
[34:35.20]I want to protect you.
[34:38.14]He's walking into the fire.
[34:39.12]We have to protect both these guys?
[34:40.68]I'm gonna protect you.
[34:43.04]Dude, so... I have... There's so much shit happening right now.
[34:46.21]I don't have any idea what's going on.
[34:49.01]Watch out.
[34:53.61]Well, that's minus 10 minutes.
[34:55.69]Apparently.
[34:56.17]Hold on.
[34:57.05]Wait, we can't... Wait, wait, wait.
[34:58.07]We can't pause it.
[34:58.69]We can't pause it.
[34:59.55]We can't.
[35:02.52]That guy... Why am I immediately hit?
[35:04.90]Hey!
[35:08.95]This is not fair!
[35:11.05]Why was this guy- is this guy dead?
[35:14.13]Well, now he is, and now his face can't be shown on TV.
[35:17.27]I shot him- I shot him with the ugly gun.
[35:21.30]I shot that guy with the ugly gun.
[35:27.00]Get over here, you fucking idiot.
[35:29.20]Look at the way this guy's standing.
[35:30.76]I know!
[35:31.20]I know, I was about to say the same thing, cause he was doing it on my side.
[35:34.00]Alright, they won't shoot this guy.
[35:35.12]At least I don't think they will.
[35:38.55]Are you blind fired?
[35:39.27]What are you doing?
[35:43.67]You're blind fired.
[35:44.27]That guy's got a fucking headache.
[35:45.29]He's killing me.
[35:45.79]That guy's got a fucking bad headache.
[35:48.26]What is he doing?
[35:54.66]He's like our friend.
[35:55.90]Wait, I'm holding this guy's dead body?
[35:58.93]This guy sucks.
[36:00.11]Oh, this guy's getting destroyed.
[36:03.79]It's too much going on.
[36:05.49]It's too much.
[36:07.33]This game, I can't even react.
[36:09.49]How much time?
[36:09.93]It's just chaos.
[36:10.45]There's someone behind every corner.
[36:12.03]I know.
[36:12.39]It's too... Give me this shotgun.
[36:14.93]Ugh.
[36:16.31]Alright, we're currently... Okay, so listen.
[36:18.30]We're currently at minus ten, plus four.
[36:21.06]So we're at minus six.
[36:22.10]Right.
[36:28.02]I'm sorry, dude.
[36:28.73]I can't even.
[36:29.45]Fuck.
[36:29.97]This is too much going on.
[36:32.83]Wait.
[36:33.59]One more.
[36:35.79]There's one more guy.
[36:38.19]Where's the last guy?
[36:39.87]Got him.
[36:40.64]Nice.
[36:40.96]Okay.
[36:41.22]All right.
[36:41.42]Hold on.
[36:42.00]Can we all tap?
[36:42.62]Is it safe?
[36:44.12]It's safe.
[36:44.64]Okay.
[36:44.98]I'll tap.
[36:45.90]Minus six.
[36:46.90]What's the net gain?
[36:48.88]Minus six.
[36:52.89]I don't think the last...
[36:55.08]I can't do it.
[36:55.86]My minus one.
[36:57.04]My minus one is not working either.
[36:58.68]Pause it.
[36:59.06]Pause it.
[36:59.42]Pause.
[37:00.56]You can't.
[37:01.16]You cannot pause the game.
[37:02.24]No, no.
[37:02.48]Pause the fucking timer.
[37:05.11]Oh.
[37:05.69]All right.
[37:06.05]What are you at right now for your time?
[37:07.73]Three hours, ten seconds.
[37:09.47]Okay.
[37:10.01]But pretty much we're at three hours pretty much exactly.
[37:12.69]So let's just reset it three hours.
[37:14.83]Reset it three hours because it broke.
[37:17.07]Yeah.
[37:17.87]And I am ready when you are.
[37:19.73]Three, two, one, bang.
[37:21.39]All right, let's just make sure to add a minute and subtract a minute.
[37:23.59]We lost another minute.
[37:24.93]No, we lost two minutes.
[37:25.81]Okay, so I can do it again.
[37:27.51]Can you?
[37:27.73]I'm at 257.
[37:30.78]Oh.
[37:31.62]Okay, yeah, we're at 257.
[37:33.56]Yes, 257, 48.
[37:34.12]Yep, that's exactly where I am.
[37:35.66]I'm ready.
[37:36.20]Okay.
[37:39.64]You guys got scammed.
[37:41.72]47 seconds.
[37:45.15]Wait, oh, okay.
[37:45.95]We have to go in the garage.
[37:47.15]Follow me.
[37:55.12]Time scam.
[37:57.60]Time cops.
[37:58.08]Yeah, I think we're gonna be alright.
[38:00.23]Did that just, like, skip forward for you?
[38:04.11]It did.
[38:05.45]Watch out for the 50 enemies that are gonna poke out of the cars.
[38:07.53]We've got another timer up top.
[38:09.81]10-31.
[38:10.27]I don't know what that means.
[38:11.77]I don't know.
[38:12.29]There's too many timers.
[38:13.35]I can't keep track of them.
[38:14.25]So, I think we just have to follow this guy?
[38:17.31]This dude has, like, holes in his head.
[38:20.58]Look at this guy.
[38:22.10]Holy shit.
[38:24.20]This guy should not be alive.
[38:26.26]No, for me, he's fine.
[38:27.46]For you, he's fine?
[38:28.34]He looks like a duke.
[38:31.32]Well, this guy's been shot in the head three times on my screen.
[38:36.14]Where is he?
[38:39.92]That's not a joke.
[38:40.81]That's just... No, that's not... Plus two?
[38:44.03]Nah, that's just an observation of the game.
[38:45.49]What is he saying?
[38:49.17]Why are there so many shopping carts in this parking garage?
[38:54.92]Guys, man, we're in the basement of a target.
[38:59.80]You know what I mean?
[39:01.02]Are we going upstairs now?
[39:02.54]Yeah, we're about to go up an escalator.
[39:03.94]Look at all those minus two.
[39:07.07]No, I mean minus two.
[39:09.29]There wasn't a joke.
[39:10.97]I was trying, and it was a failure.
[39:13.41]Minus two.
[39:13.93]All right, minus two.
[39:17.01]I apologize for our time loss as italics.
[39:20.55]I really don't mean to.
[39:21.71]It's like being in P.E., you know?
[39:24.27]I'm not the one that peed my pants in P.E., but still have to run laps anyway.
[39:27.89]Alright, so we're just currently running behind them.
[39:30.59]That's fine.
[39:32.34]I think they're following us.
[39:33.52]I'm like 100% confident they know wherever we go.
[39:34.60]Are you sure they're following us?
[39:36.32]Yes.
[39:39.44]What?
[39:39.74]Wait!
[39:43.14]That wouldn't make an explosion.
[39:44.90]He's dead.
[39:47.00]You're dead.
[39:49.94]Okay, I didn't die.
[39:50.90]That's not Tim.
[39:51.70]That's not Tim.
[39:52.38]Because I wasn't dead.
[39:56.75]Okay, hold on.
[39:58.03]So that's minus five.
[39:59.85]Minus five, but plus two, because that was a double joke.
[40:03.73]No, that was plus... So minus five, four, three.
[40:07.68]So that's plus three.
[40:09.34]No, that's a minus three.
[40:11.30]Wait, what?
[40:14.68]What number are we at now?
[40:16.58]It's going to be a minus six.
[40:18.68]If you carry the two, that's a plus one, a plus two.
[40:22.62]Don't forget to divide by three when you're done.
[40:26.18]I'm going to need my TI-84 for the math test, professor.
[40:29.70]And they're all saying minus two for bad math.
[40:32.50]So we got minus two, minus two, plus five.
[40:36.25]Minus five.
[40:36.75]Just minus one.
[40:39.61]Okay, but what's your overall time?
[40:41.29]2.51.
[40:41.79]2.51.
[40:43.21]That's a minus one.
[40:45.13]Okay.
[40:46.73]Because I had plus two times two and then minus five for dying.
[40:51.33]Oh, my God.
[40:52.21]Okay, let's go.
[40:54.07]Are we done?
[40:55.12]Yes.
[40:56.20]All right.
[41:01.25]Where are we going?
[41:02.29]I don't know.
[41:03.69]What's the objective?
[41:04.29]Alright, hold on a second.
[41:04.95]You're telling me if you shoot a fire extinguisher, it explodes like a bomb?
[41:10.99]Like, what?
[41:12.53]There's so many.
[41:13.47]There's at least 20 fire extinguishers.
[41:15.85]Right, so like... No.
[41:19.09]Don't do it.
[41:19.97]Oh, that's right.
[41:20.29]You'll die.
[41:20.71]Okay.
[41:21.53]Yeah.
[41:21.91]So what do we do here?
[41:23.39]I don't know.
[41:24.03]We had to figure out where to go.
[41:24.83]We should have been listening to the fucking dialogue.
[41:30.66]Is there any, like... Put that down.
[41:34.22]What are you doing with that?
[41:34.98]What are you thinking?
[41:37.00]I don't trust you with that thing.
[41:38.59]We're losing precious time.
[41:40.09]This is a timed stream.
[41:41.31]Don't blame me.
[41:41.99]Down?
[41:42.67]This way?
[41:43.15]We either go up... I hear shooting.
[41:46.79]That way.
[41:47.79]That way.
[41:48.41]It's like burped in my mouth and I almost threw up.
[41:53.37]Now there are dogs.
[41:54.11]There are fucking dogs now.
[41:55.50]There's a dog.
[41:56.96]Oh my god.
[41:57.80]Of course it's the Talix the one that shoots the dog.
[42:00.42]Why?
[42:00.76]Why do you have to bring that up again?
[42:02.34]Of course it's the Talix the one that shoots the dog.
[42:03.98]Why am I the dog shooter?
[42:06.52]This one was a vicious, vile creature.
[42:09.15]Guys, he was vicious.
[42:10.91]I had to put him down.
[42:11.71]There was no choice.
[42:12.69]There's just a million enemies.
[42:16.85]This gun is so bad.
[42:17.85]Why would you ever use this gun?
[42:21.22]Just use the pistol.
[42:22.94]Oh shit.
[42:24.86]I refuse to shoot a dog.
[42:25.72]You have to kill it.
[42:26.64]I had to do it.
[42:27.42]I'm sorry.
[42:30.06]Are you talking about the AK?
[42:30.96]Because I have an AK with awful aim.
[42:37.83]I just like skee-balled that and it exploded.
[42:41.69]Careful.
[42:46.41]That should never be a thing.
[42:48.63]I'm getting a plus two here.
[42:50.87]Hold on, we'll get it.
[42:52.24]Hold on.
[42:58.28]Oh, I'm out of ammo.
[43:01.42]Only got one gun.
[43:02.36]Where's the fire extinguisher?
[43:08.22]Okay, well, whatever.
[43:08.90]It doesn't even matter.
[43:09.62]He's dead.
[43:10.84]Alright, that's plus two.
[43:14.94]Hold on.
[43:16.18]Do you see this gun in the wall?
[43:20.22]I do, yeah.
[43:21.98]It looks like my gun.
[43:23.20]Is this your gun?
[43:23.94]No, that's fine.
[43:24.55]I'll just take ammo.
[43:25.45]Thank you.
[43:25.79]All right, good.
[43:26.23]Give us a plus two here.
[43:27.99]I did.
[43:28.93]Okay, good.
[43:29.67]Got the plus two.
[43:31.65]Oh, by the way, we probably should mention this now that most people are here.
[43:35.13]What do you mean teamwork?
[43:37.59]Oh.
[43:37.77]We can't see.
[43:38.95]If you sub or give any bits or anything, we can't see it because we cannot see our other monitors, unfortunately.
[43:45.92]So, sorry in advance, but we both cannot see anything.
[43:50.79]I barely have to chat on an iPad because we could barely make this game run and stream it.
[43:57.25]Yeah.
[43:57.63]2010 was a different time without windowed gaming.
[44:00.48]That was a funny bug plus one.
[44:01.78]No, no.
[44:17.39]Wait, we've got a lot of options here for changes in time.
[44:21.11]Because right now, take a look right now.
[44:24.60]I think it was minus 10 for dying, plus 10 for funny games.
[44:29.92]But there's also another funny thing right here.
[44:31.50]Okay, so we got minus 10 for falling.
[44:34.84]We both did it, so that's a plus 4.
[44:37.47]So we're at minus 6, right?
[44:39.49]But look at this.
[44:43.13]Like, these fucking statue-ass motherfuckers are worth at least two points.
[44:48.19]So that brings us... I feel like that one's neutral.
[44:50.85]You feel like that one's neutral?
[44:51.61]That one's neutral, guys.
[44:53.35]We are wash.
[44:54.85]We're at a wash.
[44:55.59]Because look at this.
[44:59.66]Easy.
[45:02.70]Gotta try it at least once.
[45:05.08]We're neutral.
[45:07.90]We're minus two, actually.
[45:09.82]Yeah, it's minus two.
[45:11.50]for trying to shoot the friendly guy?
[45:12.84]Yeah, that's minus two.
[45:14.90]You have to tell me who this guy's thing is.
[45:17.70]My bad.
[45:18.73]I take responsibility for that one.
[45:19.91]All right, so we're going this way, right?
[45:20.83]It's an amateur move.
[45:22.45]Amateur move, yeah.
[45:23.17]When you see the green cross there, that means you can't shoot anybody.
[45:26.41]And he's a genius with a knife.
[45:28.17]Why would this?
[45:28.77]All right, so hold on.
[45:29.33]Why does this exist?
[45:31.74]So that you can go, whoa, you grab it with your left hand and then pull yourself back.
[45:35.28]So there was actually.
[45:36.32]Hold on.
[45:37.38]Do it again.
[45:38.28]Are you sure?
[45:38.96]We don't have to go down there.
[45:39.94]Okay.
[45:40.32]No.
[45:42.56]That's a good little funny thing that's funny.
[45:46.49]Yeah, good little game gag.
[45:48.59]There's gonna be like a sniper roost over here.
[45:50.87]Oh, he's just gonna be one of the go-cover-to-cover paintball arenas?
[45:58.15]See, I told you, I knew we were supposed to come down here.
[46:01.58]Just try to take a shortcut.
[46:03.66]Both these guns are so bad, I don't know why I have them.
[46:07.10]Mine's not awful, but yeah, okay, it's pretty bad.
[46:12.35]Alright, we're good.
[46:13.85]This guy's just fucking ice skating over to you.
[46:15.46]That's great.
[46:16.06]There's about ten people coming down the stairs right now.
[46:18.80]All of them police officers.
[46:20.38]That's fine.
[46:20.76]Which, by the way, when did we transition from killing mobsters to cops?
[46:29.45]Alright, I got him.
[46:30.75]Got that police officer.
[46:32.91]Yeah, what happened?
[46:33.53]Were we in the middle of a heist?
[46:36.92]Uh, we were chasing a guy through the streets.
[46:40.32]To be fair, I did murder some civilians.
[46:43.42]So, I'm not saying it's completely unwarranted.
[46:49.12]So, alright, I want this.
[46:53.38]One guy up top?
[46:56.95]Yeah, more than one.
[46:57.89]Alright, well I got him with like eight hits.
[47:06.19]These guys all weren't even facing the same way.
[47:10.79]Okay, you know what?
[47:11.21]This guy is now unable to be seen.
[47:12.99]When you shoot him in the face, it becomes too graphic for video games.
[47:20.20]Apparently.
[47:21.06]But that guy's still alive.
[47:26.46]Let's do nude.
[47:27.28]No, he's not nude.
[47:27.74]His face was exposed.
[47:28.36]My mistake.
[47:35.86]I want that cover.
[47:37.06]You give me that cover.
[47:37.98]I know, really.
[47:39.08]I want the cover.
[47:39.82]Alright, so how, like... He just ran right next to you.
[47:48.61]These guys are fucking idiots.
[47:49.81]Wait, hold on.
[47:50.39]There's a guy behind us.
[47:51.59]Yeah, I know.
[47:52.09]He ran just past all three of you.
[47:53.99]Oh, he ran past everybody?
[47:55.05]Yeah, hang on.
[47:58.10]Make way for the van!
[47:59.68]Make way for the van.
[48:00.28]What van?
[48:03.48]Are you allowed to shoot the guy that I've taken as a human shield?
[48:06.92]Oh, let me see.
[48:07.76]Okay, apparently I can.
[48:14.61]Yeah, but he's dead in my arms.
[48:16.71]Yeah, and you're doing like a phantom seat thing.
[48:19.89]Apparently, if you noticed, I shot him in the face while you were holding him.
[48:24.23]Wasn't blurry when you dropped him, it blurred.
[48:27.34]What is going on right now?
[48:28.22]We have to go down to the left?
[48:33.98]It's like things happen too fast here.
[48:35.02]I don't know what the goal is.
[48:36.38]Watch out, you're running into blind firing cops.
[48:38.90]It's okay.
[48:40.80]I got it under control.
[48:43.16]Oh my god.
[48:43.74]I feel pretty confident.
[48:45.44]You know, I practice on hard difficulty, so medium, you know.
[48:48.61]Medium's nothing.
[48:49.87]Medium's nothing.
[48:50.65]Wait, why are we getting a plus two?
[48:51.89]What happened?
[48:54.85]Alright, we're good.
[48:55.37]Wait, wait, hold on.
[48:55.93]What's the plus two for?
[48:59.48]Oh, did you activate the cutscene?
[49:01.44]Apparently, I did.
[49:02.58]Apparently, plus two for the phantom seat gag.
[49:04.38]It wasn't that funny, apparently.
[49:06.84]Wait, but plus... If it wasn't funny, why are we getting plus two?
[49:09.99]No, it was... No, plus two because it was funny.
[49:12.19]All right, so we're at two.
[49:13.19]Yeah, plus two.
[49:14.31]All right, plus two.
[49:19.05]We're down to 245.
[49:20.42]Yes, we are.
[49:22.60]What's with the constant upward camera angle where the majority of the frame is taken up by the roof of the car?
[49:29.79]Is it because they couldn't render?
[49:30.97]It must be because they couldn't render it.
[49:32.73]It has to be that.
[49:36.77]Okay, well, I'm getting like an ad on my own fucking iPad right now.
[49:41.02]Why am I getting an ad?
[49:42.26]What the fuck is going on?
[49:45.14]Hey, we get points.
[49:46.70]That was the end of the level.
[49:47.52]That was the end of the level.
[49:48.90]You're right.
[49:49.62]We do get points.
[49:51.58]That's plus 10 minutes.
[49:53.15]But we ran into some trouble.
[49:54.35]All right, plus 10.
[49:55.91]Yeah.
[49:56.53]Boom.
[49:56.81]Almost back to three hours.
[49:58.65]I'm going to do it in a minute.
[50:00.19]Yeah.
[50:02.17]Yeah.
[50:03.91]Yeah.
[50:04.41]Yeah.
[50:05.69]I'll be there.
[50:07.25]I promise.
[50:09.07]He's very hesitant.
[50:09.71]Okay, I'll call you later.
[50:10.90]Bye.
[50:13.50]All right, so we got that supply.
[50:15.28]I got to add plus 10.
[50:16.26]Mm-hmm.
[50:21.08]And, okay.
[50:22.34]I just don't want to alt tab right now.
[50:23.76]Now I will.
[50:24.51]So, plus 10.
[50:26.51]Alright.
[50:28.29]So, only shoot if they shoot.
[50:31.35]Don't shoot anybody.
[50:35.93]We have a new companion every time.
[50:39.45]Now it's fucking bald guy.
[50:43.43]So, Talix, do not shoot anyone.
[50:46.66]Even if you think it's going to be a funny joke, don't risk it because it could be not a funny joke.
[50:50.13]Wait, hang on.
[50:51.36]Don't shoot anyone?
[50:52.52]You can't shoot anybody.
[50:53.62]Oh, okay.
[50:54.58]We're in a sweatshop.
[50:56.66]I have to use self-control.
[50:59.34]Use self-control because this is dumb.
[51:00.80]Let's check the rooms.
[51:01.74]Got to make sure there's no collectibles.
[51:05.26]What do you mean collectibles?
[51:06.69]I don't know.
[51:08.41]Back when this game came out, the number one thing I bet people played this for... That guy's dead.
[51:14.81]What the fuck?
[51:18.78]Alright, our companion is dead.
[51:21.54]He didn't even make it.
[51:22.36]He didn't make it through the... Through the first... Alright, you take one of ours, we take one of yours!
[51:28.11]No, I can't.
[51:28.73]She's fucking... Look at how scared she is.
[51:30.05]No, I'm not doing that.
[51:35.61]I thought about it.
[51:36.55]You did, but like... And he's still got a cigar in his mouth.
[51:44.81]Through the window.
[51:45.81]Why would you go?
[51:46.43]Oh, wait.
[51:46.85]He should be right in the face.
[51:49.33]Guy in a polo.
[51:50.43]Very well dressed with a belt.
[51:55.73]Okay, I think that's... People are saying plus two.
[52:00.44]Somebody just gave a lot of money and I don't know who it was.
[52:02.66]I love donuts.
[52:03.32]I think it was you.
[52:04.92]Thanks for the bunch of money.
[52:08.08]Wait, we get plus two?
[52:09.38]That's a plus two.
[52:10.46]Plus two.
[52:11.30]Plus two.

[52:39.02]Every innocent person that we accidentally kill is minus one minute.
[52:42.40]If it's on purpose, if it's for a joke, it doesn't count.
[52:45.02]We're going to fucking... This stream's going to be over real quick.
[52:47.53]All right, where are we going?
[52:50.25]Not this way.
[52:51.03]Right, this way.
[52:52.17]No.
[52:53.11]Yeah.
[52:54.03]Yeah?
[52:54.33]No, yes.
[52:55.05]What do you mean, yeah?
[52:55.81]Wait, you went the right way.
[52:56.57]It goes in a circle.
[52:57.27]It goes in a big circle.
[52:58.45]Oh, there you are.
[53:01.59]Not this again.
[53:02.33]Are we going to get lost a second time?
[53:04.31]I'm walking around in a circle with you.
[53:06.14]I yeah I I'm gonna get you so I easy I don't want to lose any time here this way um we gotta talk I have no idea we will later no who's talking I don't I don't know who said this deal was bulletproof
[53:29.72]Where am I?
[53:30.22]I think I'm running backwards through the whole level.
[53:34.40]No, that's a bad guy.
[53:35.42]Grab who?
[53:39.93]If you want to know how to get to me, I can't tell you.
[53:43.71]You can't tell me how to get there.
[53:45.41]No, I just ran and eventually I found where I'm supposed to go.
[53:49.14]I'm in a fucking goddamn closet.
[53:52.82]I think I got it.
[53:54.28]I think I'm alright.
[53:54.76]Did you say graffiti?
[53:57.44]Yeah or nay?
[53:59.10]Yeah or nay graffiti.
[54:00.24]Are you dead?
[54:03.49]You better not be dead.
[54:06.85]Why do you have to tap E if it doesn't work?
[54:09.89]What's the point of tapping E rapidly if it does nothing?
[54:13.90]All right this time don't run off without me.
[54:16.04]We can't play like Hansel and Gretel right here.
[54:17.72]Hold on That's plus that might wait wait wait wait.
[54:19.18]Yeah, I know you're angry.
[54:19.86]That's minus 10 minutes To where we're supposed to go.
[54:24.78]Okay, that's gotta be like time back right for saving time.
[54:28.16]No.
[54:28.42]No, that is minus 10 minutes Yeah, but then we get time back because I would have had to come find you and leave you back here But instead we teleported you here tells you better make a fucking grade a quality joke coming up here You're on thin ice
[54:41.92]You can't make jokes on demand.
[54:43.70]That's asking for minus time.
[54:44.88]Oh yeah?
[54:45.32]Easy.
[54:45.82]How about this one?
[54:50.55]Fuck, he's right.
[54:51.45]Alright, let's go.
[54:52.93]It's just minus time waiting to happen.
[54:56.43]It's like saying, please subtract more time.
[55:01.57]I don't want to do that.
[55:03.65]It's too much to think about right now.
[55:05.34]I'm afraid to lose time, and now you're dead.
[55:07.86]How do I get you?
[55:08.70]How do I get you?
[55:10.40]I got it.
[55:11.20]I'm alive.
[55:11.48]I'm dead.
[55:11.94]Nope, you're dead.
[55:12.78]Alright, can we just pause for a minute and collect our thoughts?
[55:18.45]Uh, did you die too?
[55:21.59]I think I was gonna make it, and then you died.
[55:23.05]Okay, so it's minus five.
[55:25.23]Like, I was tapping E, but like, I was getting up.
[55:27.83]Okay, let's go.
[55:28.45]Hang on, what time are we at?
[55:30.71]We're at fucking 2.35.
[55:31.59]35?!
[55:31.67]Yes, I just died.
[55:32.25]I died!
[55:38.24]And then we both died.
[55:39.74]Yeah, we both died, and then I died.
[55:41.64]Okay.
[55:44.78]Alright, we're going to do this one correctly.
[55:46.47]Let's do this one correctly.
[55:47.37]No messing around.
[55:48.49]We're up against the clock.
[55:50.51]See?
[55:50.91]Doing it correctly.
[55:57.17]Doesn't seem like it's working very well.
[55:59.23]I'm already dead.
[56:01.34]No, you're not.
[56:02.24]No, you're not.
[56:02.66]You're good.
[56:04.72]Okay.
[56:05.36]Easy.
[56:05.70]There's a guy up top.
[56:11.77]Why is the accuracy just so awful?
[56:14.03]It is so bad.
[56:14.71]And you are holding that guy off the ground, by the way.
[56:17.53]You are holding that guy in the air with one hand.
[56:22.48]You are like a fucking professional wrestler right now.
[56:25.38]Turn him this way.
[56:26.28]Bring him over here.
[56:27.52]Bring him over here.
[56:28.02]I want to see him up close.
[56:31.52]Okay, I'll fucking dump his ass.
[56:33.15]Alright, let's go.
[56:38.17]Easy, though.
[56:41.01]Was that a not plus or minus joke?
[56:43.77]People were saying plus two.
[56:45.35]Okay.
[56:46.99]But we... Hold on.
[56:47.65]We're going to have to remember that one.
[56:48.67]Remember that one because I don't want to die in here.
[56:51.68]Oh, my God.
[56:52.58]Is that... No.
[56:55.38]He was... Why are we, like... We're occupying the same space.
[57:01.47]I'm just so paranoid.
[57:02.65]I'm sorry.
[57:03.23]Like, I don't want to...
[57:06.13]I don't want to lose any more minutes either.
[57:07.49]I know.
[57:07.99]We have to be careful.
[57:09.35]We got to do some more funny jokes.
[57:13.15]Watch out!
[57:13.57]Easy.
[57:13.79]Watch out.
[57:14.10]Okay.
[57:14.34]Watch out.
[57:14.68]Watch out.
[57:14.92]There's a lot of innocent people here.
[57:16.24]No.
[57:16.44]Those are not innocent people.
[57:17.56]Watch out.
[57:17.82]I got a fire extinguisher.
[57:19.82]All right.
[57:20.04]Alex, do not pop your head out of the room.
[57:21.40]There's more!
[57:24.28]All right.
[57:24.56]Now you're free.
[57:25.37]You can get out.
[57:25.99]You're free.
[57:26.55]You're free.
[57:27.21]You're free to get out.
[57:27.79]You can move.
[57:33.28]All right, stay together, though.
[57:34.22]Stay together.
[57:34.86]Yep, uh-huh.
[57:35.72]We're together.
[57:38.18]I want a pistol.
[57:38.78]Pistols are way more accurate than anything else.
[57:42.86]Ow.
[57:46.10]What kind of fucking cover system is this?
[57:50.75]Got him.
[57:52.09]No, I didn't.
[57:52.85]No, yeah, I did.
[57:54.59]He's dead.
[57:55.01]Okay.
[57:56.67]Almost there.
[57:57.71]We got a plus two, by the way.
[57:59.13]Are we?
[57:59.55]We do have a plus two.
[58:00.73]Top timer is 14...
[58:03.92]14, 13, yeah.
[58:04.88]What is that for?
[58:06.82]What if we actually were being timed to beat the game?
[58:09.60]There's a lot of armed people that just ran past.
[58:12.48]Huh?
[58:13.70]Did you notice those guys?
[58:14.72]No.
[58:14.86]Did you plus two?
[58:16.20]Yeah, plus two.
[58:17.03]All right, I need you over here.
[58:19.69]I'm here.
[58:20.31]I'm here.
[58:21.01]Don't rush me.
[58:21.59]What?
[58:22.91]Oh.
[58:23.55]Oh, these are good guys.
[58:24.19]Dude, you can't just throw.
[58:25.27]Are these all good guys?
[58:28.33]These guys are all such useless.
[58:29.15]I think these are all good guys.
[58:31.35]Which ones are the bad guys?
[58:32.61]I don't know.
[58:33.49]Game crash.
[58:33.95]Are we doing the innocent death?
[58:35.43]That's a game crash.
[58:36.13]Ladies and gentlemen, we got a game crash.
[58:37.79]Uh-oh.
[58:38.31]That's plus 20 minutes.
[58:39.62]That's plus 20 minutes.
[58:40.56]That's a plus 20 minute timer.
[58:41.88]Game crash.
[58:43.22]Plus 20.
[58:43.60]I hope it keeps checkpoint.
[58:45.08]We might have to start this whole level over.
[58:49.16]We got plus 20 minutes, and we got to pause that timer, too.
[58:53.89]Oh, yeah.
[58:54.07]5, 10, 15, 20.
[58:54.15]Pause.
[58:54.27]I'm at 254.24.
[58:59.75]so I should just quit out or can you join in my game I'm gonna try to do but like just yeah before I quit oh like that's bullshit never mind we got a fucking crash and give me one second will I get this shit organized again we'll pause the timer 2010 ladies and gentlemen 2010 it's I'm surprised it took an hour for the game to crash to be honest uh it took longer than that it's been like an hour and a half hasn't it no it's only been like an hour all right let me open the game back up oh yeah it has been an hour
[59:28.78]It's been an hour.
[59:32.36]Alright, I'm relaunching the game.
[59:34.56]I'm going to mute everything because I don't know how loud the opening fucking splash screens are.
[59:43.25]Two hours until done.
[59:46.13]Okay, I'm going to try to join off of you.
[59:47.79]Mm-hmm.
[60:00.44]Preferably more.
[60:03.31]So let's join off of you if I can.
[60:08.69]Join game.
[60:09.99]Joining lobby.
[60:11.23]I think I'm getting in.
[60:11.91]I think so.
[60:16.65]I'm ready.
[60:20.85]First of all, are you in the game?
[60:25.99]It says you have to ready up.
[60:30.10]Oh, okay.
[60:30.74]Okay.
[60:31.44]So the timer was currently at 2 54 24 for me 254 24 We've been perpetually at 254 apparently we've had we've had equal amounts of jokes and equal amounts of like We've been at three out But here's the funny is money something really fucking funny We've been streaming for an hour
[60:57.69]we're breaking completely even we've okay it's alex I know it's alex's muted I'm sorry uh yes we are breaking even because we've only been streaming for an hour and it's been like an hour so this is like turning out to be like fucking stupid okay um ready to start the timer 254 24. I am ready to start the timer 254 24.
[61:22.24]Alright, three, two, one, bang.
[61:24.78]Okay, I'm going.
[61:26.54]I'm ready.
[61:27.16]Hopefully this doesn't put us at the very beginning of the level.
[61:30.02]I think it will.
[61:30.68]Okay, well we have to be very careful then.
[61:33.68]I believe that it will.
[61:36.28]Wait, no, I did Welcome to Shanghai.
[61:37.42]Oh, what have you done?
[61:39.78]I didn't know.
[61:40.26]I thought it would just automatically pick the last chapter.
[61:44.13]Oh, no.
[61:44.53]No, God, no.
[61:46.21]Wait, do it.
[61:48.81]Just skip the cutscene and quit out.
[61:51.45]Press enter, skip the cutscene, let the stream buffer, and then quit out.
[61:56.45]That was not a joke.
[61:57.47]That doesn't count either way.
[61:59.43]People are saying a lot of minus fives for this one, Italics.
[62:03.75]We're already losing time to the buffer.
[62:05.81]The timer is still running and we're not making any progress.
[62:08.47]It's going to take five minutes to do this.
[62:13.66]So I'm not going to detract another five minutes on top of this one.
[62:18.56]We're being penalized ourselves already.
[62:21.65]Somebody, ILoveDonuts gave $1500.
[62:25.17]Somebody gave $50 earlier too, like twice.
[62:28.27]I'm so fucking sorry.
[62:29.19]I'm going to have to look at it.
[62:29.85]At the end of the stream, here's what I'm going to do.
[62:31.93]I'm going to go and take a look at my dashboard at the end of the stream and I'll make sure to read all those.
[62:38.28]So, before the stream ends.
[62:40.42]Okay, quit the game.
[62:44.50]Quit the game.
[62:46.44]Try this one more time.
[62:49.20]What was the name of the level?
[62:50.73]I don't know.
[62:52.29]Whatever the last one is that you can pick.
[62:53.77]That guy just said that this is a shithole.
[62:58.80]I can't close the game.
[63:00.10]He did say that, yeah.
[63:02.36]Even though I had quit out, that's the last thing he said.
[63:04.60]Okay, hosting a game.
[63:06.38]I can't get out of the game.
[63:08.97]Invite the game.
[63:09.73]I can't leave.
[63:12.55]Look, I can't leave the game.
[63:13.95]I've been closing.
[63:15.56]Alright, it's called Blood, Sweat, and Tears.
[63:17.36]Okay, can I join?
[63:19.64]I'm trying to join you.
[63:21.69]Yeah.
[63:23.11]I invited you again.
[63:23.95]Did it work?
[63:25.77]So if the game's not crashing in a co-op stream, it's unable to invite friend.
[63:34.03]I'm joining Lobby now.
[63:35.17]Alright, I'm here.
[63:37.47]Blood, Sweat, and Tears.
[63:38.33]This is the right one.
[63:39.41]I can't even play a YouTube video.
[63:41.75]No fucking around, by the way.
[63:43.09]This is really important.
[63:44.23]Wait, that's what that button is.
[63:46.09]It's the YouTube button.
[63:48.47]Right, but we're losing time, Italics.
[63:50.18]We've got to go.
[63:51.74]But why are they using the YouTube button as their level select?
[63:55.96]I don't know.
[63:56.50]But we gotta go.
[63:57.54]We're going.
[63:58.02]It's loading.
[63:59.38]We're wasting too much time.
[64:00.48]There's so much time being wasted.
[64:03.09]What do you mean the highway?
[64:04.89]I just saw a picture of the highway.
[64:06.43]I was hoping that we're way past the highway sequence.
[64:10.56]Oh, God.
[64:11.84]Is this gonna... It's gonna be the highway.
[64:15.12]Is it gonna be the highway again?
[64:16.04]I think he just said we ran into some trouble.
[64:19.79]I don't know, dude.
[64:21.11]It's past that one.
[64:22.41]I hope so.
[64:22.89]It's the one where the guy dies in the first door.
[64:26.29]I fucking hope so.
[64:30.56]It's gonna be the highway and I'm gonna be really mad.
[64:33.02]No, it's not.
[64:34.50]We're gonna be fine.
[64:39.62]Is this game about some guy filming?
[64:41.80]Try to keep this guy alive.
[64:42.62]This is a documentary.
[64:44.98]Uh, kick the door instead of this guy.
[64:46.34]Walk in front of him.
[64:47.70]We can skip this cutscene.
[64:49.03]Oh.
[64:49.51]Okay, make sure this guy doesn't die.
[64:50.85]He dies, like, right here.
[64:52.37]Kick it up and quick.
[64:54.45]We can't.
[64:55.37]Can't.
[64:55.85]You can't.
[64:56.53]No!
[64:57.13]No!
[64:58.29]Don't do it!
[64:58.83]Don't do it!
[65:00.74]Ah, they took away my gun.
[65:01.80]We've got, like, a default pistol again.
[65:04.00]Quick!
[65:05.38]Wait, he... Did you kill somebody accidentally?
[65:09.02]He's still alive.
[65:10.02]When does he die?
[65:10.82]Just keep going.
[65:11.42]Keep going.
[65:12.04]I didn't kill anybody.
[65:13.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[65:14.42]Where is he?
[65:17.53]Keep this guy alive at all costs.
[65:18.67]Break the door down before he can.
[65:21.33]Alert everybody.
[65:21.89]Make sure everybody knows he's coming in.
[65:23.43]Try to kill the guy that shoots him.
[65:27.29]He's dead.
[65:27.55]Remember this guy?
[65:30.21]Go.
[65:38.70]Where are they coming from?
[65:39.80]I don't know, but we have to make up a lot of time from the crash.
[65:43.76]That's true.
[65:45.89]And you don't... Neither of us remember how to get unlost.
[65:49.55]It's okay.
[65:49.91]There's like a... I found the circle.
[65:52.41]Found the loop.
[65:53.03]Okay, you... Come to me.
[65:54.91]I think you're going the right way.
[65:55.97]I am.
[65:58.32]Slow it down, though.
[65:59.26]We are up against the clock.
[66:00.00]No, you said hurry.
[66:02.24]That's going to make me throw up, though.
[66:03.24]It's like the way this game moves.
[66:04.44]It's kind of insane.
[66:08.39]We made it back.
[66:09.37]We should turn on shaky cam just to show people what they don't have to watch.
[66:12.71]No, I refuse.
[66:13.05]I'll throw up.
[66:13.69]I'll have to leave this room.
[66:19.47]That guy was asleep.
[66:26.36]That guy was asleep standing up.
[66:28.10]That guy was trying to hide the fact that he was asleep.
[66:30.66]Don't just run in.
[66:31.42]This is a dangerous room.
[66:32.34]Metallics.
[66:32.92]Oh, God, no.
[66:38.62]Did I get you?
[66:39.20]Did I fucking get you?
[66:40.82]Oh my god, no.
[66:42.12]I was gonna make it.
[66:42.92]You died.
[66:43.50]You died second.
[66:44.32]You ran into the room.
[66:45.46]No, but you died second.
[66:46.02]Wait a second.
[66:46.62]I was gonna make it.
[66:47.26]I was tapping E quickly.
[66:48.44]That's minus five.
[66:49.48]That's minus ten.
[66:51.42]And then plus two.
[66:52.82]So that's plus.
[66:53.44]That's minus eight.
[66:57.18]Minus ten plus two.
[66:59.28]We're minus eight.
[67:01.72]Good.
[67:04.88]Okay, let's go.
[67:09.84]It's the guy upstairs in the window that is so annoying.
[67:14.69]Uh-oh.
[67:16.25]Who is... You go.
[67:18.75]You go first.
[67:19.41]I have a pistol, dude.
[67:21.12]We don't have any of our weapons from before.
[67:22.74]You don't have a shotgun, too?
[67:24.10]No, I don't have a shotgun.
[67:25.24]Pick up a gun from the ground.
[67:27.04]What ground?
[67:29.96]Dude, it's all just ammo for me.
[67:32.39]Are you dead?
[67:32.77]I thought you were upstairs.
[67:33.71]What are you thinking?
[67:34.69]I thought you were upstairs.
[67:35.99]I got you.
[67:36.29]I got you.
[67:36.59]I got you.
[67:37.05]I got you.
[67:37.33]Back it up.
[67:37.65]Back it up.
[67:37.91]Back it up.
[67:38.15]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[67:39.33]Any fire extinguishers?
[67:42.46]Plenty of fucking leather jackets.
[67:44.28]Oh my fucking god.
[67:45.32]That's a minus two.
[67:50.28]You know why there's so many leather jackets, right?
[67:52.84]Why?
[67:53.38]It's a Chinese sweatshop.
[67:56.15]I don't even know what that means.
[67:57.67]No, that's the level.
[67:59.11]We're in a Chinese sweatshop.
[67:59.97]Oh, okay.
[68:00.37]We actually are in a sweatshop.
[68:02.17]Okay.
[68:02.89]Yes.
[68:03.45]That's the whole point.
[68:04.81]You see all the sewing machines.
[68:08.33]Okay, so that's a minus two.
[68:10.19]That's a plus two.
[68:11.87]We're even.
[68:12.29]Let's go.
[68:18.88]Ow.
[68:19.06]I don't know what it is with this room, but these guys just hurt.
[68:23.76]I know.
[68:24.94]Their bullets are stronger than everybody else's.
[68:27.94]Pick up a gun.
[68:28.46]Pick up someone's gun.
[68:29.59]I do.
[68:29.77]I have a gun.
[68:30.11]I got a gun.
[68:33.19]No, they ain't!
[68:33.90]No, this way!
[68:36.08]Whoa!
[68:37.92]Hang on, I found the thing.
[68:39.08]You tell me that old-ass fucking man kicked that door down?
[68:42.70]Did it.
[68:43.22]Got achievement.
[68:44.28]What achievement?
[68:45.78]I got achievement for blowing people up with a fire extinguisher.
[68:48.36]It's got to be worth at least two minutes.
[68:49.97]No, I don't know about that.
[68:51.41]Achievement is worth nothing.
[68:53.89]This is a 2010 achievement.
[68:55.77]No, that's true.
[68:57.69]They were harder back then.
[68:58.81]They weren't just easy golds.
[69:01.99]Alright, this is where we crashed last time after this.
[69:05.05]Yeah.
[69:05.71]Is it because you alt-tabbed or did you just crash?
[69:07.67]No, I just crashed out of the game.
[69:09.09]Alright, here we go.
[69:12.45]Hopefully I don't crash.
[69:15.99]Minus 10 for thinking achievements are worth something.
[69:18.11]Alright, we're good.
[69:18.77]Let's just go.
[69:19.79]Watch this guy die instantly because he's an idiot.
[69:22.11]Hey, go back and tell that to my, like, 17-year-old self, you know?
[69:24.87]I'm gonna take his gun.
[69:26.99]He had a good gun.
[69:28.27]My Xbox 360 achievement hunting.
[69:31.36]was invaluable.
[69:33.84]How is that guy still alive?
[69:36.60]Alright, this is a big open area.
[69:40.07]I'm just... And I don't have any guns that can shoot further than... I'm doing a lot of work here.
[69:46.61]Oh my god.
[69:50.97]I'm going in.
[69:52.57]I just took out like five people.
[69:56.63]Going in.
[69:57.31]Why are all these guys like 45 years old?
[70:01.20]They're all old.
[70:05.39]They're just old mafia men, you know?
[70:08.15]You're all old!
[70:11.09]You're too old!
[70:13.95]Fucking stop it!
[70:14.99]Don't!
[70:15.85]I'm dead.
[70:16.17]Oh no!
[70:19.25]You told me to stop it and then you did the exact same thing.
[70:22.73]Be honest.
[70:23.61]We're fine.
[70:24.37]We're fine.
[70:24.77]That's fine.
[70:25.23]Hold on.
[70:26.87]That's a minus.
[70:27.65]That's a minus ten and a minus two.
[70:30.83]So that's minus 5, 6, that's minus 7.
[70:33.73]Wait, you said minus 10 and minus 2.
[70:36.07]No, no, minus 5 and minus 2, because I made a fucking it joke for no reason and it got us killed.
[70:42.84]Okay.
[70:43.14]Alright, we can handle it.
[70:47.22]We can handle it.
[70:49.46]Okay.
[70:50.26]That, like, fucking Michael Jackson moonwalk that you just did might be worth points.
[70:55.43]What did I do?
[70:58.49]Might be worth something.
[71:02.03]Everything's just too erratic.
[71:04.72]They're like, up left, up right.
[71:06.28]Alright, just hang on.
[71:07.30]Spewing in from the ground floor.
[71:09.64]They're like advancing towards us.
[71:11.88]I have a little SMG and a shotgun.
[71:16.32]You have an assault rifle.
[71:18.00]I mean, I'm picking people off.
[71:20.28]Wait, there's an assault rifle.
[71:25.91]Wait, ah, it's a Scorpion.
[71:28.73]Okay, why do we have this crew of four or five useless people?
[71:33.95]Because, remember, this game is... I think the guy just threw a grenade.
[71:37.77]Yeah, these guys are taking up valuable fucking real estate.
[71:40.13]Like, get the hell out of the way.
[71:41.19]There's a lot of cover back here.
[71:45.01]Like, get the fuck out of the... Seriously, these guys are such a useless bunch of teammates.
[71:49.82]I want to move in the position that this guy is in.
[71:51.58]Alright, we're going in again.
[71:54.44]Easy.
[71:56.40]Just a little bit.
[71:57.06]Just a little bit.
[71:59.98]I don't see anybody up top.
[72:01.88]I think it's just the people across.
[72:05.41]What is this gun?
[72:06.75]It's a shotgun.
[72:10.27]Oh, goodness.
[72:12.63]Just one guy.
[72:13.41]Alright, our team is moving up.
[72:15.37]They're moving up with us.
[72:16.56]Good.
[72:17.06]Because we really do need them.
[72:19.08]We need these guys.
[72:19.98]They're not just a waste of fucking... Why is this the hardest segment in the whole game?
[72:30.22]These weapons are so inaccurate, it's just prey if you hit a person.
[72:33.22]Even when you do hit them, there's at least 12 hit markers.
[72:36.24]If you don't hit them in the head.
[72:38.26]What a 2010 game.
[72:39.02]Alright, easy.
[72:43.04]I think we're at the... I think we're... Hey, cheat physics.
[72:51.02]That is pretty bad.
[72:51.66]You know, that is 2010 of us.
[72:52.56]Alright, lift door.
[72:54.36]Let's go.
[72:57.28]Open this up.
[72:57.74]I'm here.
[72:58.00]I'm here.
[73:00.89]Okay, we good.
[73:03.99]Apparently, that was it.
[73:05.17]Now we go.
[73:09.09]14 hours, 14 minutes.
[73:10.31]Where do I get that?
[73:11.97]Where do I get the axe?
[73:12.99]Are you serious?
[73:13.71]This guy's a fucking fire axe.
[73:16.29]And he throws it.
[73:16.77]Can I get it?
[73:17.97]God damn it.
[73:18.52]That's so unfortunate.
[73:21.10]No melee weapons.
[73:22.86]That's so unfortunate.
[73:25.56]Ah, they're here.
[73:28.27]Huh?
[73:29.13]He's going in!
[73:30.55]They're coming around the back, too.
[73:31.41]Here he comes back.
[73:35.88]You get in there.
[73:36.40]That was a very brave teammate.
[73:38.64]Yeah, is it this guy with the ponytail?
[73:41.38]Yeah, this guy has no mercy, dude.
[73:43.30]This guy's insane.
[73:46.06]People are just getting in the way of this guy.
[73:50.50]He got him.
[73:52.68]He's just taking hits.
[73:53.80]Do you feel like these are players?
[73:55.84]I feel like these are all just a bunch of fucking randos.
[73:58.36]You know what I mean?
[73:59.73]We accidentally joined a public lobby.
[74:01.49]We have a public lobby.
[74:06.51]They're immortal.
[74:07.87]They can't die.
[74:08.61]I don't think they can die.
[74:11.29]We can just find a way to push them out in front.
[74:13.37]Are there any bullets?
[74:19.14]only the gun was accurate enough to shoot a person.
[74:21.94]You know, that would be great.
[74:22.66]You know, it takes one full magazine per person.
[74:27.00]Alright.
[74:28.80]Get the fuck out of my way.
[74:30.35]What's on the computer?
[74:31.05]Computer joke.
[74:31.53]Here we go.
[74:33.25]I think we can make a computer joke here, Talix.
[74:36.33]Please help me.
[74:36.77]Please help me.
[74:37.17]Please help me.
[74:37.59]Please help me.
[74:38.01]Please.
[74:38.17]Talix, please.
[74:38.71]Talix, you have to come now.
[74:39.53]Did I get you?
[74:43.87]I hit E. I promise you I hit E. You saw me chat.
[74:46.89]I picked up the guns that were next to you instead of picking you up.
[74:50.85]E is the same button for both.
[74:52.53]That's minus 12.
[74:54.48]No, it's minus 5.
[74:55.50]I didn't die.
[74:56.20]No, that's minus 7 because I was trying to make a computer joke and it didn't work.
[75:01.02]Only you died.
[75:01.62]I didn't die.
[75:02.42]I was right next to you.
[75:03.32]It's minus 7.
[75:05.78]Minus 7.
[75:06.50]And we have to do that whole segment over again.
[75:08.36]Fucking my god.
[75:11.69]No wonder this game is a fucking 3 out of 10 on Metacritic.
[75:14.82]Whatever it is.
[75:18.80]We have to beat this, though.
[75:20.44]Come on.
[75:22.84]Get over here, please.
[75:24.02]How was I down in three shots?
[75:25.36]I don't know.
[75:26.75]Is there a fucking... No, what do you mean, you go?
[75:29.09]What do you mean, you go?
[75:35.58]You're doing good.
[75:36.14]You're shooting the wall.
[75:37.10]I'm doing it.
[75:37.50]I got all people.
[75:38.96]There's one guy that's like hiding inside the wall.
[75:41.81]What?
[75:42.45]Where?
[75:42.81]Who's down?
[75:43.49]What?
[75:43.67]I'm fine.
[75:44.53]I'm not down.
[75:46.11]We just take turns.
[75:46.87]Like if you get down, then I go.
[75:48.41]And if I get down, then you go.
[75:49.40]That's actually a really good idea.
[75:51.98]What is it?
[75:52.26]Steak and eggs?
[75:54.62]That wasn't a joke.
[75:55.20]That was just an observation.
[75:58.84]I was so scared that people were going to think that was a joke.
[76:01.50]Where's the computer?
[76:07.53]Wait, people sent plus two.
[76:09.73]Why are we all in a line here?
[76:11.23]Let's get in line.
[76:14.63]Keep your eyes peeled, Kane.
[76:16.67]I want to watch Law and Order on the TV.
[76:20.53]Do they point the gun on the... Why are they all following me?
[76:24.05]They're all following you.
[76:24.91]Nobody cares about me.
[76:25.89]Alright, let's just go.
[76:29.35]Is there a boss up here?
[76:30.85]Oh, you... What?
[76:34.73]You are all over the place.
[76:35.55]Look at the Backstreet Boys on the stairs back here.
[76:37.73]I hope there's a boss.
[76:43.45]They're all gone.
[76:44.29]We lost everybody.
[76:46.11]Plus five for having a stroke on stream.
[76:51.94]that's a squad we're about to get ambushed about to get ambushed all right well we have time it's that's plus two I'm getting I have to see a lot of plus twos what is it for it's for the funny like get in line joke like everyone's like standing single file it was funny plus two plus two take a hint use y to take a hint take a hint do you see like the text hint yeah my hint is just pointing at you

[77:22.62]Do not use your controller.
[77:25.64]Okay, we're here.
[77:26.87]We're here.
[77:27.67]It's the same guy from earlier that slit his throat.
[77:30.17]Yeah, no, it's... He's back.
[77:32.89]What if it was?
[77:34.25]What if he slit his throat?
[77:35.41]I hope this guy slits his throat.
[77:37.55]In hindsight, I realize I should not have said that.
[77:40.23]He's just like, I know he's on the ground.
[77:51.91]Who's talking?
[77:52.85]It's the guy on the ground.
[77:54.27]Oh.
[77:55.47]Who shot a girl?
[78:01.97]What are you talking about?
[78:08.05]I didn't shoot a girl.
[78:09.67]I think they're talking about the naked woman that the guy shot.
[78:13.40]No, consequences don't... This is 2010 italics.
[78:15.56]Consequences don't mean anything.
[78:17.54]No, but we didn't shoot him.
[78:19.22]The naked guy we were chasing shot the girl and then slit his throat.
[78:22.16]I think it was that girl.
[78:24.57]Wait, are we getting... Ambush.
[78:27.25]We got ambushed by our own squad.
[78:34.45]Okay.
[78:36.08]What the fuck is going on?
[78:37.44]I don't know.
[78:38.20]Why is a helicopter landing?
[78:41.21]You didn't hear the train?
[78:42.23]I didn't hear the train.
[78:42.97]I... What?
[78:44.57]I don't understand this.
[78:45.86]I'm going this way.
[78:46.64]Going this way.
[78:47.00]We're not supposed to go this way.
[78:47.78]This is like a fucking shitty scripted event.
[78:52.14]We just go upstairs.
[78:52.84]Okay.
[78:55.01]We should take cover behind the wall.
[78:56.13]No, no, no.
[78:56.63]Use cover.
[78:57.35]I am using cover.
[78:58.07]All right.
[78:58.81]Who do you want?
[78:59.19]Do you want guy with... Hold left.
[79:02.13]Yeah.
[79:03.75]I'm getting hit.
[79:04.89]I'm literally getting hit.
[79:07.03]Cover flips.
[79:07.48]All right.
[79:08.78]Do you want the default blonde guy or default blonde guy?
[79:12.60]We're just going.
[79:13.94]What's happening?
[79:14.30]We're just running.
[79:15.48]All right.
[79:15.76]That guy just got run over by... Nothing happened to him.
[79:19.28]Maybe give me a hint.
[79:20.40]Uh-oh.
[79:20.94]Uh-oh.
[79:22.36]Help.
[79:23.00]Help.
[79:26.26]Get me up!
[79:27.14]Get me up!
[79:27.74]I was just trying to get off the wall.
[79:44.05]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[79:46.88]That's a minus five.
[79:47.84]That's a minus five, but... Guy got run over by the car, didn't get run over.
[79:52.64]That's plus two.
[79:54.60]You, uh, you going down there making a funny little funny thing was plus two.
[79:59.30]So we're at 214.
[79:59.90]Oh, 214.
[80:01.96]214.
[80:02.10]Okay.
[80:02.72]Okay.
[80:05.38]You ready?
[80:06.36]Yeah.
[80:08.78]Just leap.
[80:09.48]Okay, listen, listen, listen.
[80:10.44]Important.
[80:10.78]Don't not shoot the two blonde identical twins over on the right, okay?
[80:14.62]On the right.
[80:15.36]It's so important because they're just placeholder people.
[80:17.80]They don't do anything.
[80:18.54]They don't shoot.
[80:19.40]They don't react.
[80:19.86]What are you talking about?
[80:20.86]You do not see the two blonde guys that are identical twins on the right side.
[80:26.41]You don't see these two guys.
[80:27.13]They're standing there guarding, holding the guns.
[80:30.57]Do not shoot.
[80:31.27]There's another one, too.
[80:31.89]There's another one.
[80:32.53]There's like three of them.
[80:33.53]Am I seeing fucking ghosts?
[80:34.95]What?
[80:36.44]There are four of them.
[80:37.82]There are four of them.
[80:38.68]They don't do anything.
[80:39.28]All right, this is important.
[80:39.96]Give me a location.
[80:40.82]Give me a location.
[80:41.58]A location everywhere.
[80:42.80]Every single spot.
[80:44.14]They've taken over.
[80:44.89]It's like Agent Smith.
[80:46.15]They're seriously becoming everybody.
[80:48.03]Just trust me.
[80:48.71]Trust me on this.
[80:49.67]Only shoot the guys in the white shirts.
[80:51.57]Okay.
[80:52.17]But try not to shoot anybody else.
[80:53.27]I only see guys in white shirts.
[80:57.41]I don't know what you're talking about.
[80:59.13]There's no blonde people on my screen.
[81:00.61]Yes, there are.
[81:00.91]Yes, there are.
[81:01.69]Fuck, I actually just shot one.
[81:04.14]Kerma's going crazy.
[81:05.40]I am not going crazy.
[81:06.34]We have to destroy the van.
[81:07.88]What?
[81:11.14]Okay, that guy is... It went two feet forward.
[81:14.06]This guy very clearly... This guy very clearly doesn't exist.
[81:18.64]What happened to that guy?
[81:22.51]Okay, let's get out there.
[81:23.23]Let's get out there.
[81:23.65]We gotta get out there.
[81:24.15]I think you broke the game.
[81:24.85]We gotta get out there now.
[81:25.85]This is so important.
[81:27.37]We gotta get out there.
[81:29.65]Just fucking... Fuck the cops.
[81:30.63]We gotta get down there.
[81:35.22]Oh, shit.
[81:37.04]These guys are the blonde guys.
[81:38.08]I need to fucking examine them.
[81:42.71]Oh, don't you dare.
[81:43.65]Don't you dare.
[81:47.47]I'm trying.
[81:47.91]Okay, I have no bullets.
[81:49.19]Alex, you have to fight people.
[81:50.47]I'll go.
[81:51.11]I got bullets now.
[81:52.15]I go.
[81:52.49]You stay.
[81:53.05]No, I'm good.
[81:55.42]I need help.
[81:56.84]This door is very heavy.
[81:58.36]Oh, wait a minute.
[81:59.40]Oh, no, no.
[82:00.16]Wait a minute.
[82:00.44]Go back, back, back.
[82:02.96]You can't get down there.
[82:04.30]Come on, I can't get down there?
[82:05.24]You can't get down there.
[82:06.88]What are we supposed to do about these random placeholder fucking assets that don't have any scripting?
[82:11.08]I wish I could tell you, but I can't even see them.
[82:12.88]I can't kill them.
[82:16.92]I trust in your judgment that it's a very funny joke.
[82:21.78]I hear them screaming, though.
[82:22.88]I do hear them screaming.
[82:23.62]You hear them screaming?
[82:26.92]Yeah, yeah.
[82:29.14]Oh, come on.
[82:31.62]I don't hear anything.
[82:36.47]I wish I could dive over there.
[82:37.51]Really, I do.
[82:38.07]This guy's looking at me.
[82:40.73]Yeah, I can hear him talking.
[82:42.51]What is he saying?
[82:43.05]They're just screaming like death throes.
[82:50.66]Okay, that's it.
[82:51.50]Let's go.
[82:51.88]Any, like, fuel tanks?
[82:53.66]There are people sitting in the van, by the way.
[82:56.68]No, yeah, they're dead.
[82:57.44]We killed them.
[82:58.06]Oh, no, now he is.
[83:01.71]Oh, so he wasn't dead before.
[83:04.27]I guess not.
[83:06.48]I think that's a plus 10.
[83:10.20]I'm watching in chat right now.
[83:11.44]Plus 10?
[83:12.04]Is that what we're saying?
[83:14.26]Plus 10, but it's a minus 5 because the joke was too long.
[83:16.32]That's a plus 5.
[83:18.56]So overall, net gain plus 5.
[83:20.42]Overall, net gain of plus 5.
[83:22.32]Okay, plus 5.
[83:23.45]I'm ready.
[83:23.81]Plus 5 to the counter.
[83:28.29]Okay, I will.
[83:31.41]I got your hand.
[83:33.33]Open the gate.
[83:34.45]It's on wheels.
[83:35.29]A lot of trash.
[83:40.64]What are you trying to say?
[83:41.54]I mean, there's a lot of trash everywhere.
[83:43.02]Watch out for the dog.
[83:47.56]Oh, the dog is now sensitive.
[83:49.64]I didn't... Wasn't me.
[83:51.80]Wasn't me.
[83:52.90]Oh, shit.
[83:54.68]I didn't do it this time.
[83:55.84]Who are you going to blame?
[83:57.74]I didn't want to lose ten minutes.
[84:06.52]I didn't want to lose 10 minutes, guys.
[84:08.78]Down here.
[84:10.50]Killing dog minus one minute.
[84:13.52]No, because that... It wouldn't make sense because you have to do it.
[84:16.60]You have to.
[84:17.86]They don't give you any choice.
[84:22.33]We just did a co-op moment.
[84:24.11]Do we have to do another co-op moment?
[84:25.43]We have to climb the wall.
[84:30.63]We got a cutscene.
[84:34.45]Legit.
[84:37.32]This is just fucking Tyler from GTA 5.
[84:43.46]What's his name?
[84:43.96]Tyler, what's his name?
[84:48.01]The guy from GTA 5, Trevor.
[84:50.11]Trevor.
[84:51.53]They stole this from Trevor from GTA.
[84:54.65]No, Trevor stole this from... Minus two.
[84:58.07]God damn it, you're right.
[85:01.39]Minus two.
[85:02.15]I did, yeah.
[85:11.43]I think we're at a milestone in the game, though.
[85:16.26]Yes, this is the start of another chapter.
[85:18.12]Well, I got an achievement.
[85:19.80]I didn't get an achievement last time.
[85:22.44]Did you get an achievement last time?
[85:24.06]This achievement is for complete this mission on any difficulty.
[85:31.14]So, not much of a milestone, truth be told.
[85:37.86]People that just got here, we're doing a... Oh, new level.
[85:41.49]New level.
[85:42.15]Okay.
[85:42.61]So that's plus 10.
[85:43.57]Go ahead and explain.
[85:45.47]So if you do plus 10, will I explain?
[85:48.64]So we're doing a...
[85:52.13]Did you hear that horn?
[85:53.29]No.
[85:55.05]So we have to beat the game in this time limit, right?
[85:58.63]Yeah.
[85:59.03]Okay, now I heard the horn.
[86:02.03]Are we eating drugs right now?
[86:04.23]What drugs are we eating?
[86:04.91]We're drinking beer.
[86:06.23]And we're eating some kind of drug, right?
[86:09.41]It looks like rock candy.
[86:14.92]And he's holding a Slim Jim.
[86:16.48]Alright, we got Slim Jims and rock candy.
[86:18.46]Oh, surprise.
[86:19.34]Surprise dinner.
[86:20.98]Your dinner's been ruined.
[86:22.22]We were eating Slim Jims with fucking chopsticks out of a bowl.
[86:26.54]Every 20 seconds or so, someone that doesn't like us ambushes us.
[86:34.51]Is there any explanation as to why any of this is happening?
[86:39.77]I think the official explanation is we killed a very important mob boss daughter.
[86:44.99]And now that's why the SWAT team is after us.
[86:46.35]Or they think we did.
[86:47.43]They think we killed the mob boss.
[86:49.35]I don't know if we did.
[86:50.35]Is that you?
[86:51.31]It's not you.
[86:54.17]And these guys have armor.
[86:56.29]They do.
[86:58.03]That was a minus two.
[86:58.49]Which means our guns suck even more.
[87:00.54]It was a minus two and a plus two there, so it's even.
[87:02.24]It's okay.
[87:03.08]What was the minus two?
[87:04.08]Minus two was the joke before the Slim Jim joke.
[87:07.44]Slim Jim joke was pretty good.
[87:09.38]That's a net even.
[87:15.40]All right, finish the explanation.
[87:17.26]So every time we die... The timer that's on the screen, we have to beat the game inside of that timer.
[87:22.90]We have to complete the game.
[87:24.73]Yeah, have to complete the game.
[87:26.55]Every time we die, we lose five minutes on the timer per person.
[87:31.35]So it's a shorter amount of time that we have to beat the game.
[87:34.68]Yes.
[87:34.96]Every time we make a funny joke...
[87:37.33]we get plus two minutes added back.
[87:39.03]More time to beat the game.
[87:40.39]Every time we make an unfunny joke, minus two minutes, less time to beat the game.
[87:45.03]More of a rush.
[87:48.09]Yeah, it adds a little bit of spice to it, you know what I mean?
[87:51.11]And every time... Are you alright?
[87:55.86]Yeah, I'm good.
[87:57.34]Every time we beat a level, we get plus ten minutes.
[88:00.38]So it gets a little bit better.
[88:02.46]And that's a plus five for quality... Oh my fucking god.
[88:09.96]Get up.
[88:11.64]That's a plus five for a quality explanation.
[88:14.41]I would say, yeah, that's plus five.
[88:17.59]Plus five?
[88:18.21]Plus five for a quality explanation.
[88:22.01]Where is this guy?
[88:24.07]That is the co-op challenge.
[88:25.39]Fucking God.
[88:28.96]Everything is like... I got you.
[88:30.08]Good.
[88:30.30]I got you.
[88:31.80]Right here.
[88:37.47]Oh, the SWAT team's probably here because we have killed hundreds of cops.
[88:43.84]True.
[88:44.54]Taliesin, you made the rule where there was one minute per random hostage.
[88:54.37]But it's okay, though.
[88:58.77]Are you fucking kidding me?
[89:01.21]You didn't even give me an opportunity to make a joke.
[89:03.49]I was going to make a joke and then shoot him.
[89:05.67]And then now we just lost four minutes.
[89:07.99]I was going to make like a fucking Batman Begins Scarecrow joke.
[89:11.03]And then I was going to make a Bloodborne joke and get us up to plus four and make it a net even.
[89:15.67]Now I can't do that.
[89:16.85]No, but that was the joke, though.
[89:18.64]No, that's a minus four, dude.
[89:20.38]There was an inception layer of joke there.
[89:23.98]Because it was unexpected.
[89:25.18]You did not expect... There was a...
[89:28.31]It was predicated on the idea that I wouldn't do it because we would lose four whole minutes.
[89:33.26]So you were convinced I wouldn't.
[89:34.70]So to surprise you, the element of surprise, I murdered them all immediately.
[89:39.43]That was the joke.
[89:40.01]That's true.
[89:40.27]What do you guys think?
[89:40.93]That's true.
[89:41.67]That's a minus four, but it could be a net even.
[89:50.98]No, I'm sorry.
[89:53.07]I'm saying minus two because the joke needed explanation.
[89:55.27]Okay, so that, yeah, we're at minus two.
[89:57.67]Because it needed explanation.
[89:59.39]Minus two.
[90:00.11]Because your explanation was kind of funny, so it's a plus.
[90:02.18]That's a minus two.
[90:03.02]We're at 220.
[90:03.36]Okay, let's go.
[90:03.90]220?
[90:03.92]Yep.
[90:04.08]Okay.
[90:12.27]Open the door.
[90:12.97]I'll take it.
[90:13.61]We saved... We just got those innocent deaths on discount.
[90:18.45]On discount?
[90:19.38]You used a kill civilian coupon.
[90:21.94]That's a plus two.
[90:23.00]That's plus two.
[90:24.28]Okay, we're good.
[90:26.40]The kill civilian coupon joke.
[90:27.90]Come on.
[90:28.10]Keep going.
[90:29.92]Okay.
[90:43.88]Wait No, he's just he should have had a go minus one.
[90:48.34]There wasn't even no it's minus two for what it was minus one civilian That guy stood up, and he was threatening He stood up with a very threatening demeanor don't you?
[91:01.00]Okay, oh my God give me a break Stairs or not I'm gonna say stairs.
[91:11.03]Let's go with stairs.
[91:11.77]Oh
[91:13.19]Is this for one of those, like, hey, you go up here, it's a co-op moment.
[91:16.83]You get to snipe from up above.
[91:18.19]This is a co-op moment.
[91:19.51]Oh, wait, somebody scattered the cockroaches.
[91:25.70]God damn it.
[91:26.86]Why?
[91:27.46]They heard me aim the gun?
[91:30.78]Why are they, like, fucking birds?
[91:32.46]They, like, didn't see you?
[91:35.46]How did they find you?
[91:36.34]I don't know.
[91:36.96]I, like, aimed and they all started fucking, like, I turned the light on.
[91:44.67]I'm doing, like, sneak attacks.
[91:46.39]Actually, I'm impressed.
[91:47.61]The blinds move when you shoot them.
[91:51.51]I think my cockroach joke was a plus two.
[91:54.81]I didn't see them.
[91:55.47]I can't judge.
[91:56.65]I mean, it was a plus two.
[91:58.21]It definitely was.
[91:59.45]It was an objective plus two.
[92:01.36]It was definitely a plus two.
[92:02.54]I can guarantee you that.
[92:04.84]Do we only get plus one because it was a hypothetical joke?
[92:08.36]No, plus two.
[92:09.16]It was a good joke.
[92:11.22]This guy's currently in an invisible Boston Crab.
[92:14.13]Somebody's got him in a Boston Crab.
[92:16.89]Sting's got him.
[92:18.03]Or another wrestler.
[92:19.69]I don't know.
[92:20.03]That might be a minus two.
[92:23.09]I don't know.
[92:23.63]You tell me.
[92:25.41]I'm just playing Pac-Man over here.
[92:29.30]That's not a minus two.
[92:30.48]No.
[92:30.76]That one would have...
[92:34.12]What?
[92:34.98]How did you make him do that?
[92:36.38]I don't know.
[92:37.02]He gave up, but I didn't know that that's what he was doing until I read the subtitles.
[92:42.58]I just saw police officer and I shot.
[92:44.80]I have been brainwashed.
[92:46.22]Minus four?
[92:46.88]No.
[92:46.94]He was an innocent.
[92:49.24]He had a gun.
[92:50.40]Metallics, I'm really fucking us right now.
[92:52.00]That's minus four.
[92:52.64]Wait.
[92:53.44]For what?
[92:53.88]The bad... I had two bad jokes back to back.
[92:56.24]The sting joke and the Pac-Man joke.
[92:59.40]Minus four.
[93:00.14]That's minus four.
[93:00.84]So we're at 217? 216.
[93:03.64]Okay.
[93:04.46]We're going to be on a crowded street.
[93:05.80]We've got to act cool.
[93:06.56]260.
[93:06.68]Okay.
[93:07.36]We're going to be on a crowded street.
[93:09.78]There's a lot of opportunity to get time back here, Talix.
[93:12.70]Is it okay if we have a gun out?
[93:14.90]Because he said we have to act cool.
[93:17.18]I guess.
[93:17.68]Don't draw attention to ourselves.
[93:19.22]This guy doesn't seem to care.
[93:22.62]Is there a holster weapon button that we don't know about?
[93:24.77]He's freaking out.
[93:25.71]What are you shooting at?
[93:27.21]I didn't shoot.
[93:28.01]I have not shot a bullet.
[93:30.85]What?
[93:31.89]I haven't shot anything.
[93:32.97]What about the guy over here, Talix, that's driving the car?
[93:36.34]That's driving the car outside, sitting in his window.
[93:40.18]He's perfectly inside the car for me.
[93:41.78]He's perfectly inside the car for you.
[93:43.58]Well, that's good.
[93:45.12]I just scared everyone.
[93:46.02]I don't know how, but they're all terrified of me.
[93:48.60]Except this gentleman.
[93:49.70]Why are they all scared of you?
[93:51.32]He's just looking at me kind of peculiarly.
[93:54.44]How do I get this guy to drive?
[93:57.56]Okay, I'm being shot.
[93:58.88]I'm taking fire.
[93:59.93]I didn't do it.
[94:05.25]They did it.
[94:08.89]Wait, I did it.
[94:10.29]Where now?
[94:10.51]I did it.
[94:11.03]But it doesn't matter.
[94:12.23]It doesn't matter.
[94:12.77]Wait, we got some math to do.
[94:13.77]Wait, what did you do?
[94:14.88]What did you do?
[94:16.44]This fucking guy over here was driving on top of his car like a fucking dickhead.
[94:22.80]Ugh.
[94:25.03]So what am I supposed to... How many minutes?
[94:26.67]I think that that might be a... Okay, there's a minus one for a... Minus two for a civilian kills.
[94:31.37]Oh, goodness.
[94:32.27]But that's a plus four for two funny jokes back-to-back.
[94:34.89]So we're at plus two.
[94:38.36]217.
[94:38.78]217.
[94:38.80]217.
[94:41.48]That was plus... I had to add plus three to get to that.
[94:47.60]Well, somehow our math didn't add up somehow.
[94:50.92]I don't know.
[94:52.08]So who was shooting you?
[94:53.62]You said people were shooting at you?
[94:54.84]Police.
[94:55.40]The police that were in this car ran up to me and started shooting me.
[94:58.61]Well, they're not in the car anymore.
[95:00.99]Because they came out and I killed them.
[95:02.77]Oh, you killed the police officers.
[95:04.61]Okay.
[95:05.43]But they shot first.
[95:06.63]So, like these guys, you know, I didn't shoot them.
[95:09.91]They're just here.
[95:10.51]There's so many cops on the left.
[95:16.70]There's so many.
[95:20.58]Are you going up?
[95:22.56]Don't go up.
[95:22.94]What do you mean, don't go up?
[95:25.52]Oh, they're all shooting at me, so it's okay.
[95:27.20]But I got lit up.
[95:28.46]Is there propane?
[95:28.94]I just said something about propane.
[95:29.88]I am still getting lit up.
[95:32.50]I cannot peek my head out.
[95:33.78]This is like a... Just stay alive.
[95:35.31]...looney tune.
[95:37.71]Don't worry.
[95:38.09]Papa will take care of it.
[95:39.33]You gotta distract him.
[95:40.61]Alright, it's co-op moment.
[95:41.69]I'm up high, you're down low.
[95:42.65]You gotta take the heat off.
[95:43.69]Okay, that doesn't count.
[95:44.87]I didn't kill that guy.
[95:47.47]Okay, just peek over and shoot, please.
[95:54.92]I'm down.
[95:56.36]But I'm okay.
[95:56.88]I'm up.
[95:57.52]I'm up.
[95:57.82]I'm down.
[95:58.22]I'm up.
[96:00.56]I'm just going to sit here for a minute.
[96:04.64]This gun is so inaccurate.
[96:05.90]Holy shit.
[96:06.48]All I have is a shotgun.
[96:07.84]All right.
[96:08.20]I'm going to go this way.
[96:11.76]I think I'm stuck up here.
[96:13.14]I don't think I can move.
[96:17.10]All right.
[96:17.76]They can't hit me over here.
[96:19.13]Oh, God.
[96:22.27]Coming in.
[96:22.53]All right.
[96:23.19]They're all shooting at me now.
[96:24.88]No, I don't think so.
[96:26.10]What do you mean you don't think so?
[96:29.42]Hi.
[96:34.24]Oh, you're here.
[96:34.86]They're shooting at me too.
[96:40.93]Where?
[96:41.23]Where?
[96:41.53]Where?
[96:45.23]He's still... He's still alive.
[96:46.89]He's still alive.
[96:47.81]No way.
[96:48.99]That's such bullshit.
[96:50.67]Hey, look.
[96:51.19]Hitman.
[96:52.75]Where?
[96:53.37]There's a bunch of Hitman on this wall.
[96:55.27]Is there?
[96:55.53]Yeah.
[96:56.79]Where?
[96:57.65]Look at the wall.
[96:58.57]Oh, that's so cool.
[96:59.39]Who made this game?
[97:00.20]Who made this game?
[97:03.92]And a clown.
[97:04.56]There's an angry clown.
[97:05.64]Oh, clowns.
[97:06.94]Mini ninjas.
[97:07.72]It's just like looking through a scrapbook of old games.
[97:13.80]Kind of is.
[97:16.44]There's one guy that keeps running back and forth.
[97:23.54]Ho!
[97:24.16]Ho!
[97:24.90]Ho!
[97:25.92]Ho!
[97:27.94]What was that sound effect?
[97:29.67]I don't know.
[97:31.55]Did you hear that like quintuple layered explosion?
[97:35.91]Yeah.
[97:38.87]Maybe I can get a hint.
[97:41.73]I don't know.
[97:42.11]That button doesn't do anything.
[97:43.85]It won't do anything for me.
[97:46.68]We just got a tactical nuke.
[97:48.96]We did.
[97:51.78]We just dropped a tactical nuke.
[97:53.63]Cutscene.
[97:54.73]Okay, good.
[97:56.73]No, not a cutscene.
[97:58.55]Oh.
[98:00.56]Kind of disappointed.
[98:02.68]Are we talking about this guy's wife?
[98:04.36]About the whole point of the story?
[98:06.70]I have no idea.
[98:08.72]All I know about this game is you run around and you shoot at people.
[98:12.38]Mostly police officers.
[98:13.96]Yes.
[98:16.96]What's that guy holding?
[98:19.29]What's that guy holding?
[98:20.45]What are these guys doing?
[98:23.14]I think they're good.
[98:23.88]I think they're okay.
[98:24.68]All right, good.
[98:27.36]Upstairs, right?
[98:30.24]Weren't we already here?
[98:34.83]We already were up here.
[98:36.03]Didn't we do this already?
[98:38.13]Are these just reused assets?
[98:39.45]What's going on?
[98:41.07]This is like a boss, dude.
[98:42.13]This is going to be a boss fight.
[98:43.19]This is a boss.
[98:47.49]This is like the creepy boss music.
[98:51.83]It's a helicopter, of course it is.
[98:53.82]Where is it?
[98:57.70]Where the hell is it?
[98:59.34]Oh.
[99:00.40]A big red helicopter.
[99:02.19]I'm assuming it's a bad helicopter.
[99:04.55]I'm getting hit markers on it.
[99:06.45]They did just play.
[99:07.63]He just said, I don't think it saw us.
[99:12.95]We both just unloaded a magazine at it.
[99:15.45]I don't think it saw us.
[99:17.25]We just both unloaded clips into it.
[99:20.51]I'm getting hit by something.
[99:23.59]There's a lot of propane by me.
[99:26.19]Oh, I'm in a bad place.
[99:28.13]Don't shoot over here by me.
[99:35.99]That was at least plus two for the skill shot.
[99:37.61]Was it?
[99:40.01]We're doing plus two for skill shots?
[99:41.29]I hit my own... Help me, help me, help me, please, help me, please, help me, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
[99:50.66]Yeah, I ran straight towards you and I couldn't make it.
[99:54.00]That's minus ten.
[99:56.70]Plus two for your skill shot.
[99:59.97]I shouldn't get penalized for dying.
[100:01.29]I only ran out because you died.
[100:02.89]But you died.
[100:04.69]hmm debatable no actually no I didn't I didn't die you didn't so that I got up so what did they got downed and then I got up so it was minus five three all right so that we're at 208 how are you always losing an extra minute I gotta lose another minute I just clicked four times are you sure you're not no all right I'm at 209 I'm at 209
[100:28.97]Wait, now you're at 209?
[100:30.01]Wait, what are you talking about?
[100:32.64]208.50 is my current time.
[100:33.58]All right, hold on.
[100:34.04]Synchronize the watches.
[100:34.86]208.50.
[100:35.02]Yeah.
[100:35.66]208.50.
[100:36.02]No, no, no.
[100:38.14]I didn't pause it.
[100:40.72]208.45.
[100:40.98]208.45.
[100:41.04]Yeah.
[100:41.60]Three.
[100:43.70]You ready?
[100:46.56]Three, two, one, go.
[100:50.93]Okay, we're fine.
[100:51.63]We're synced.
[100:52.17]We synced the watches. 208.45.
[100:55.97]Here comes the helicopter.
[100:57.13]I need to take a pee break.
[100:58.65]How do we do this?
[100:59.41]We can't stop the clock.
[101:01.57]No, we cannot stop the clock.
[101:02.64]Do you have to pee soon?
[101:04.22]No.
[101:05.44]Go pee soon.
[101:08.12]There's only one way we can do this.
[101:09.12]Go pee.
[101:09.80]We have to both do this because I don't want to waste any time with you going to the bathroom because we're going to lose time.
[101:17.81]I don't- I don't have to pee, Mom.
[101:19.71]Like, I know you're gonna stop at the Sonic anyway on the road trip, but I don't have to go.
[101:23.81]Alright, well just go in the bathroom and just, like, strain until pee comes out.
[101:27.41]So then you're not gonna have to.
[101:28.29]Alright, watch out- watch out for the fucking- fucking- watch out for the fucking- fucking- fucking stupid.
[101:37.83]Good.
[101:39.79]Good.
[101:40.31]Good.
[101:41.51]Okay.
[101:45.76]Oh, I almost just killed you.
[101:48.38]Watch out for those propane tanks.
[101:50.26]You mean the ones that are on fire?
[101:52.30]The ones that are on fire.
[101:53.89]I'm down.
[101:54.81]I'm getting up.
[101:55.83]Just don't... Why did they say split up?
[101:58.63]Why did they say it?
[101:59.31]Okay, I don't know if that guy was a... Which guy?
[102:03.83]That one.
[102:04.09]I shot the guy in the head.
[102:05.85]Okay, I'm good.
[102:09.30]Alright, just be easy.
[102:11.12]Here comes more...
[102:16.80]Alright, I'm coming around.
[102:17.40]Watch out!
[102:20.14]They got snipers!
[102:21.52]They have snipers.
[102:22.24]Apparently.
[102:23.55]Of course they do.
[102:25.63]Where did these guys come from?
[102:26.89]Where did you guys come from?
[102:28.77]They just fucking came off a stage left.
[102:31.25]That didn't make any sense.
[102:34.41]Jesus.
[102:35.46]Behind you!
[102:35.86]What are you doing behind me?
[102:40.02]He's peeking out.
[102:41.26]He's coming up.
[102:42.50]These guys are spawning in such insane areas.
[102:47.88]I don't know if it's spawning or if we just missed them.
[102:50.23]I don't know, but that's plus two, by the way.
[102:51.59]I'm looking at my chat.
[102:53.45]I got a triple kill and it was like a funny reference to stage.
[102:56.19]I helped.
[102:56.53]Thank you.
[102:57.15]And you helped too, a little.
[102:59.13]All right, I'm plus two.
[103:01.82]Plus two.
[103:03.16]This is where we need to be, apparently.
[103:04.22]All right, 208.
[103:04.92]What?
[103:06.14]Is that?
[103:06.80]Oh, that guy has a sniper.
[103:07.54]I got a sniper rifle now.
[103:08.80]Got him.
[103:10.82]The sniper rifle is terrible.
[103:11.80]Yeah, it's going to be a 2010 scope.
[103:16.33]Where it probably just zooms it in slightly.
[103:18.05]Yeah, why is 2010 scope just make my FOV bad?
[103:23.27]We're here.
[103:24.01]What do you mean get down?
[103:26.54]I don't know.
[103:26.92]He said get down.
[103:28.76]Don't do anything irrational.
[103:30.48]Where are you?
[103:31.64]I think this is a stealth area.
[103:33.82]Oh, there you are.
[103:35.54]Is this a stealth zone?
[103:37.17]I'm going to assume it is.
[103:38.53]Because he said get down.
[103:41.59]I mean, do you have a sniper rifle?
[103:43.47]No.
[103:44.73]So I got to make the shot here.
[103:48.12]Where are you?
[103:48.92]Oh, wait.
[103:49.64]It's a sniper.
[103:52.54]Where are you?
[103:53.94]Hold Y. I gotta wait till his head pops out and then I can get him.
[103:57.94]Got him.
[103:58.58]Where am I?
[104:00.51]Well, I think... Be careful.
[104:02.41]A lot of people are coming.
[104:03.57]I gotta snipe that other guy.
[104:06.49]What?
[104:07.77]You take the guys on the ground.
[104:08.59]I'll take the guys on the...
[104:10.87]I got to get the sniper guy.
[104:11.85]What happened?
[104:12.55]Where are you?
[104:13.53]Nothing.
[104:14.51]What are you doing?
[104:14.89]I'm fine.
[104:16.09]I'm just not taking anyone out.
[104:17.35]Excuse me.
[104:17.75]You got to take this guy out.
[104:19.37]He's currently going to cause me a lot of trouble.
[104:21.29]That guy?
[104:25.08]I only have two bullets left.
[104:27.32]I have to kill the fucking sniper.
[104:29.26]Two bullets.
[104:30.40]Yeah.
[104:31.76]I got him.
[104:33.02]With one bullet to spare.
[104:34.04]Help.
[104:34.30]Help.
[104:34.68]Me.
[104:34.98]Me.
[104:35.20]Oh!
[104:37.78]I got you, but you have to help me.
[104:38.76]I'm dead.
[104:40.42]Okay.
[104:40.90]Help me.
[104:41.26]Okay.
[104:42.20]I can't get you up.
[104:42.88]No, you have to.
[104:43.44]Otherwise we lose.
[104:45.02]Okay, we're good.
[104:45.50]I'm getting you up.
[104:46.04]Are you up?
[104:46.48]I'm up.
[104:47.26]I'm up.
[104:47.52]Okay.
[104:48.26]Where are we?
[104:48.62]Where is he?
[104:52.69]Thank God we just saved him.
[104:53.33]I hear the bullets, but I don't see them.
[104:54.85]I killed the snipers.
[104:55.83]There he is.
[104:57.21]I got him.
[104:57.79]I got him.
[104:58.97]I got the guy that was getting us.
[105:00.87]Minus two?
[105:01.29]What are you talking about?
[105:01.91]That was fucking flawless.
[105:04.01]Hey, we both got up and no one died.
[105:06.17]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[105:07.75]That's a joke.
[105:09.95]No, there's no joke.
[105:10.73]There's a guy still right here in front of me.
[105:12.73]Yeah, I think I killed him.
[105:14.48]Did you?
[105:14.72]Yeah, I'm pretty sure he's dead.
[105:18.84]All right, you got him.
[105:20.54]Good.
[105:25.34]Should we get some time for teamwork?
[105:30.09]You'll be the judge.
[105:31.73]I don't know.
[105:33.50]Um, there's an army of people.
[105:39.05]Jay!
[105:42.27]Ooh, a sniper.
[105:43.57]I can't see anything.
[105:49.16]Okay, um... This sniper does suck, by the way.
[105:51.72]I completely agree.
[105:52.96]I can't... There's a lot of people stuffed in here, but I can't see anything, so I can't shoot them.
[105:57.98]I'm looking at the Muppets.
[105:59.66]They're completely looking at me right now.
[106:01.78]Oh my god, seriously.
[106:03.41]There's about three or four of them that are just taking turns popping up one at a time.
[106:09.55]Why did that person die?
[106:11.65]I shot him, that's why.
[106:15.37]We're the Muppets!
[106:18.44]Why did I just auto-instantly lock onto that person?
[106:24.86]So where are we at right now?
[106:25.68]We had a plus five and then...
[106:28.41]What was it, plus five?
[106:29.45]Plus five was for our incredible teamwork.
[106:31.63]Okay.
[106:33.77]What else?
[106:34.25]And then minus two for the Muppets.
[106:37.95]Plus two for the Aimbot.
[106:38.85]That was pretty funny.
[106:39.51]Yeah, I mean, that was kind of funny.
[106:40.84]It was funny from my perspective, at least.
[106:43.32]Yeah, that's funny.
[106:46.87]I'll take a neutral over a minus two.
[106:48.71]I'll take a neutral here.
[106:50.27]People are saying it's minus because I didn't drop the revolver.
[106:52.45]But hey, I like the revolver.
[106:54.47]Sorry, guys.
[106:55.05]I like using the revolver.
[106:56.67]So we're neutral.
[106:58.33]No change.
[106:58.81]No change.
[107:11.55]I don't care.
[107:11.93]Let's go.
[107:14.46]What?
[107:15.20]I'm just running in and shooting.
[107:16.98]What?
[107:17.16]You don't even need to aim down sights, Alex.
[107:18.64]We've been doing it wrong the whole game.
[107:20.17]Through there.
[107:21.63]That's her apartment.
[107:23.59]Well, coincidentally, we don't need to shoot anyone else anyway.
[107:26.47]Get her somewhere safe.
[107:27.89]Okay?
[107:28.75]We just have to sprint around and hold down left mouse button.
[107:32.76]Sue?
[107:34.40]Oh, Glazer.
[107:35.92]No, it's just expecting Sue.
[107:37.74]Plus two hours.
[107:38.68]What do you mean trying to hide?
[107:41.24]What time are we at right now?
[107:42.82]We are at 2 hours.
[107:46.78]And we've been streaming for almost 2 hours.
[107:52.01]Did we?
[107:53.85]That's plus 10.
[107:56.43]Give it a plus 10.
[108:00.37]Add some time to the clock.
[108:02.52]Okay.
[108:03.92]Good.
[108:05.10]I think we've got a little bit of a situation here.
[108:06.72]Did I change clothes?
[108:07.56]Oh!
[108:09.03]Um, we gotta make this, we gotta be careful here.
[108:10.91]Don't go in yet.
[108:12.13]Was I wearing a beater the whole time?
[108:14.88]I think it's a different day.
[108:16.78]Oh.
[108:17.44]How do you sneak in the game?
[108:19.10]Well, there wasn't even a cutscene.
[108:21.24]Alright, this says sneak up on them.
[108:23.12]Control.
[108:23.58]It's control, okay.
[108:24.30]You have to hold it down, though.
[108:26.47]Is this guy pissing?
[108:27.23]Should we get the guy peeing first?
[108:31.91]Do you have an up?
[108:33.07]Dude, that, okay, now they all know.
[108:36.83]That wasn't sneak up on them.
[108:37.79]Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[108:41.58]What are you doing?
[108:44.48]Get out of here you bastards!
[108:57.78]Why is this working?
[109:02.66]Why is this working?
[109:06.14]Shouldn't be working.
[109:09.06]So, let's sneak up on them.
[109:10.74]That's how you're supposed to feed the officials.
[109:11.94]We started.
[109:12.22]Let's sneak up on them.
[109:14.12]I'm not restarting.
[109:14.78]No way.
[109:15.14]Oh, come on.
[109:15.56]We have to sneak up on the guys in the front.
[109:16.86]Come on.
[109:18.12]It's important.
[109:18.56]We have to sneak up on the guys peeing.
[109:19.80]It's not going to work.
[109:20.94]Yes, it is.
[109:21.36]As soon as I snuck up on the guy peeing, they immediately knew where I was.
[109:24.08]Yeah, because you grabbed him and shot him in the head with a gun.
[109:26.77]What else was I going to do?
[109:27.71]It said execute.
[109:28.91]Execute.
[109:29.33]We have to go sneak up on the guys by the cars.
[109:36.84]Nope.
[109:38.26]I can restart the chapter, but I'm scared that it will take us further back than this chapter.
[109:42.44]Let's go.
[109:43.10]That's plus two, by the way.
[109:46.20]That's plus two.
[109:48.98]Going Rambo.
[109:51.34]When the game clearly said don't do that.
[109:53.58]We're going to do this.
[109:56.27]We're going to do it right.
[109:57.85]I'll take the left.
[109:58.57]You go the other way.
[110:01.35]So I have to go the other way?
[110:03.19]Okay.
[110:04.07]So there's no revival.
[110:06.07]We don't have any revives.
[110:08.09]Oh, I see you.
[110:08.73]Okay.
[110:12.12]I think we have to do this in sync, by the way.
[110:14.90]Whatever the hell it is we're doing.
[110:16.72]Taking the stairs in sync.
[110:18.48]Yes.
[110:19.26]I am currently on the top stairs.
[110:20.36]Let me look over and see you.
[110:21.38]Watch out.
[110:21.70]You got a bogey.
[110:23.40]I got a bunch of bogeys.
[110:28.96]Okay.
[110:31.11]Doing pretty good.
[110:34.06]Doing good?
[110:34.80]We're doing good?
[110:37.34]I'm just like, I'm grabbing, I'm doing pin the tail on the donkey and they're dying.
[110:40.48]We're at like a child's party, I grab them and I spin them.
[110:43.74]Was that a hitmarker joke?
[110:45.55]No, that was a pin the tail on the donkey joke.
[110:47.17]I spin them around and then they, that guy's wearing like a fucking teeny t-shirt.
[110:54.77]Are you sure that wasn't like a pin the tail on the donkey because of all the hitmarkers joke?
[110:59.90]No, it wasn't.
[111:00.92]It was a... Can you deal with your guys on your side, please?

[111:32.35]Minus two for miscommunication joke.
[111:34.73]Minus two for italics misunderstanding joke.
[111:37.83]And minus two for pin the tail on the donkey.
[111:39.79]Okay.
[111:40.81]Wow.
[111:41.47]Wow.
[111:42.35]How many is that?
[111:43.21]That's minus six.
[111:46.23]Okay.
[111:46.89]I'm at 205.
[111:47.17]What are you at?
[111:48.57]You're at a no.
[111:50.86]What are you at?
[111:51.44]No, you're not.
[111:52.20]What are you at?
[111:53.14]I'm at 206.
[111:53.92]I'm going to 205.
[111:56.36]Minus one for you, too.
[111:58.78]I just minused an extra one.
[112:03.35]Are you minusing once without telling me?
[112:05.25]No, I keep saying it.
[112:07.48]No.
[112:10.90]That was a pretty good shot.
[112:12.04]Pretty good shot.
[112:17.58]That was a pretty good shot.
[112:22.43]I love how I was reloading the gun to do that.
[112:24.85]I'm trying to cut... Thank fucking God.
[112:38.14]What did you do?
[112:38.84]It's broken.
[112:42.23]I can't lean forward anymore.
[112:43.67]I'm stuck in a reclining position.
[112:46.59]What?
[112:47.45]Hang on.
[112:49.09]Hang on.
[112:49.49]I'm scared.
[112:50.13]Why are you such a fat guy?
[112:51.37]What did you gain, like 100 pounds?
[112:52.23]I'm actually afraid right now.
[112:53.19]Okay, I'm afraid.
[112:55.99]Do you have a face cam on?
[112:57.94]Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[113:02.91]Hang on, there's a cam here somewhere.
[113:06.10]I am stuck in this position right now.
[113:10.98]I want to see.
[113:11.62]I can't lean forward at all.
[113:14.28]Oh my god.
[113:14.90]Wait, what do you mean lean forward?
[113:16.52]Are you lying in like a fucking massage chair?
[113:18.43]I am in a inclined position right now.
[113:21.33]Hang on, let me turn my chair aside.
[113:22.81]I'm actually kind of afraid.
[113:24.31]Oh, so you're in a dentist chair.
[113:27.57]These old pneumatic chairs are actually like dangerous if they shoot up into your...
[113:35.60]Wait, what do you mean, what?
[113:36.62]What are you talking about?
[113:37.64]You have like a mechanical chair that's gonna smash up and break your spine?
[113:41.18]What are you talking about?
[113:41.92]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[113:43.54]Look, just to show.
[113:46.80]Hang on.
[113:48.34]Hang on, I gotta take my headphones off.
[113:50.34]I can't hear you.
[113:51.44]Okay.
[113:52.58]All right, Chad, look at this.
[113:55.94]Fucking smashed his chair.
[113:59.78]Do you see the angle?
[114:05.31]What the fuck?
[114:07.67]How did you do this?
[114:09.16]It's broken.
[114:11.56]How did you smash back in the chair?
[114:14.26]Did you get hit with a gust of wind?
[114:15.92]I don't understand.
[114:16.84]Hang on.
[114:23.40]Hang on.
[114:25.10]Audience can't see from the germ history.
[114:27.22]Minus five.
[114:30.56]Just go click his stream.
[114:31.92]He's streaming right now.
[114:35.18]Did you hear, like, the initial crack?
[114:37.00]I heard the snap.
[114:38.14]I thought that was, like, your wrist.
[114:39.88]No.
[114:40.44]No, that was the chair.
[114:42.21]It's actually... I'm gonna have to buy a new chair now.
[114:45.15]Well... I can still sit in it as long as I lean forward.
[114:48.77]If I put all of my weight forward, I can lean in it.
[114:51.27]Okay, well, that's a... That's a minus ten for dying, right?
[114:55.97]Are we dead?
[114:56.46]I mean, we died.
[114:57.64]We just both died.
[115:00.06]But right before your chair snapped, we died.
[115:01.90]So that's minus ten for dying.
[115:04.06]Okay.
[115:04.16]Okay.
[115:06.44]Hold on, I get- I'm- I'm- Wait, wait, wait.
[115:08.40]We were at what?
[115:09.42]2.02?
[115:10.68]Pause it, pause it.
[115:11.54]My timer fucked up.
[115:13.76]So we were at 2- If I lean back too much, I'm gonna fall.
[115:16.60]Okay, we were at 2.02, right?
[115:19.22]We're at 2.02.
[115:21.11]Okay, so that's minus 10.
[115:24.35]Why is that- What?
[115:26.09]Minus 10, yeah.
[115:26.91]Okay, I can't- Minus 1, 2- Here's the angle.
[115:30.75]Here's the angle, by the way.
[115:31.75]If I'm sitting in this chair normally, this is what it looks like now.
[115:34.82]Okay, so I am at 152, right?
[115:43.23]You at 152?
[115:43.67]I am at... I'm at whatever you want.
[115:48.69]We were at 202.
[115:49.93]Hang on, my timer's broken.
[115:52.00]My timer was broken too.
[115:52.86]I had to redo it.
[115:53.94]Okay.
[115:54.88]What's the official count?
[115:55.99]The Fisher count is right now 152.
[115:57.21]152, 26, 25, 24.
[115:57.69]And I think we need to lose like 30 for your chair down.
[116:05.77]Once you go to two, it breaks.
[116:07.09]If you go up to two.
[116:08.35]So you have to go to two, start it, and then you can use the timer again.
[116:12.50]Okay, 152.
[116:13.08]Okay, and now... What's the second count?
[116:17.96]I mean, the second count is your chair breaking.
[116:19.34]That's not funny.
[116:20.42]That's like a minus 20.
[116:21.74]No, like what is the seconds?
[116:23.38]Like what seconds?
[116:24.22]Oh, 152, zero.
[116:27.52]150, 158.
[116:27.90]We're losing precious time.
[116:30.06]I just paused your timer so I can align mine with yours.
[116:32.39]We're at 152.
[116:32.59]Okay, 152.
[116:32.77]There.
[116:32.89]Alright, 3, 2, 1, start.
[116:33.37]Okay, start.
[116:44.34]All right, so everybody can see this stupid chair.
[116:46.89]Hold on.
[116:48.49]Why are you counting?
[116:49.13]Okay, we're good.
[116:50.37]Why are you counting?
[116:51.63]Sometimes you want to count.
[116:52.47]I want to make sure I remember my fucking ABCs.
[116:54.25]That's why I started doing that.
[116:55.41]Because you weren't at 152.
[116:56.25]Hang on, I have to show the chair.
[117:01.26]Jesus, did you break it again?
[117:04.00]All right.
[117:11.10]I can't see your stream right now.
[117:13.89]I'm sorry.
[117:14.47]I'm sorry.
[117:15.19]You might as well hit it with a fucking sledgehammer.
[117:23.99]So, all right.
[117:24.43]So, people are saying that we deserve... It's not supposed to do that.
[117:27.06]We deserve plus 10 for the chair, I think.
[117:29.00]Or plus 20.
[117:29.32]For the chair?
[117:30.16]Yeah.
[117:30.66]So, plus 20 for the chair?
[117:31.54]Mm-hmm.
[117:33.08]Okay.
[117:33.36]So, that brings us to... Plus 20.
[117:35.26]That brings us to 210.
[117:37.57]I'm at 211.
[117:38.41]How are you at another negative one?
[117:40.99]Is this a long joke?
[117:42.21]I think it's you that's doing it.
[117:44.21]Is this a long-form joke?
[117:45.29]No, it's not me.
[117:46.95]I swear to God.

[118:41.00]All right.
[118:42.02]Are you ready?
[118:42.64]Before I actually fall out of my chair.
[118:46.20]Yes.
[118:46.52]Don't fall out of your chair, but let me know when you're ready.
[118:55.83]Hold on.
[119:05.63]You can go ahead.
[119:06.21]Go ahead.
[119:06.67]I'm not going to leave my friend behind.
[119:08.73]I knew you were going to do that.
[119:12.09]I got you.
[119:12.81]It's easy.
[119:13.85]I knew you were going to do that.
[119:16.16]That was not a joke.
[119:18.06]That was just me messing with Italics for his beef jerky.
[119:22.56]Messing with Sasquatch.
[119:23.36]Keep it on.
[119:23.98]We want to see if you fall.
[119:25.78]Messing with Sasquatch Italics.
[119:27.92]Messing with Sasquatch Italics.
[119:30.54]Sasquatch Italics.
[119:33.41]Why are we both on the same side, by the way?
[119:35.69]Because that's what we're supposed to do.
[119:36.99]What?
[119:38.69]This is the mission now.
[119:40.53]Why?
[119:40.93]You didn't kill this guy?
[119:43.51]This guy's face looks like it's painted.
[119:48.99]It is.
[119:49.41]He's like a computer-generated character.
[119:50.85]Of course he's going to look like he's painted.
[119:56.31]I love when they try to slide.
[120:00.75]Okay, they're all up top.
[120:01.94]That's what's going on.
[120:05.34]Holy shit, dude.
[120:06.44]What?
[120:07.30]I don't know how I'm still alive, by the way.
[120:09.38]I alt-tabbed.
[120:10.48]Why are you alt-tabbing?
[120:11.00]In the middle of that.
[120:12.50]Because I had to fix my stuff.
[120:13.98]Oh, my God.
[120:14.88]All right, we'll just keep this practice.
[120:18.68]We're okay.
[120:20.60]Alex, don't worry.
[120:21.06]Don't worry.
[120:21.86]Let me just take care of everything like a fucking good boy.
[120:24.08]Let's go.
[120:24.92]I killed the guy.
[120:26.58]Killed that guy.
[120:27.16]They're back.
[120:30.32]Killed that guy.
[120:31.18]What did you do?
[120:33.55]Head out.
[120:36.45]Yeah, now.
[120:42.07]Give me that gun.
[120:42.77]I want this gun.
[120:43.65]Which way are we going?
[120:47.69]I'm assuming we're going this way.
[120:51.41]Why did my, like... Why has this changed?
[120:55.32]Time for the first cutscene in like an hour and a half.
[120:58.82]Why are we Resident Evil blocking the door?
[121:02.96]He's way too close to the microphone.
[121:08.87]I was gonna say, did they mail that recording in?
[121:14.35]Yeah, this guy was on vacation and like mailed this recording in as like a fucking mp3.
[121:19.28]It actually sounds like he recorded it on a tape recorder.
[121:23.14]He recorded it in his like bedroom.
[121:25.70]What?
[121:26.04]Well... Okay.
[121:28.92]That does not seem fair.
[121:30.96]It's not.
[121:33.00]Who are these fucking Oompa Loompas?
[121:37.22]Remember in Willy Wonka when the Oompa Loompas are wearing these weird white suits?
[121:40.84]Plus two for the Oompa Loompa, minus two for explaining the joke.
[121:43.88]No!
[121:44.83]Because people didn't know what I was talking about.
[121:46.57]Plus two for Oompa Loompa, minus two for explaining where the Oompa Loompas come from.
[121:51.27]Come on, where's Mikey TV?
[121:54.65]How did these guys get in here?
[121:57.08]Where the hell are we going?
[121:59.40]Okay.

[124:06.72]We have a lot to cover.

[124:09.38]They threw her off the balcony.
[124:11.89]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[124:12.99]We're stuck in like a groundhog day.

[127:02.63]Are you good?
[127:03.05]I think I'm good.
[127:04.90]I'm going to unpause now, and hopefully we're good.
[127:08.44]All right, I'm going to actually try... Wait, she's going.
[127:11.22]Wait, what happened?
[127:12.36]She's already running.
[127:12.94]What are you supposed to do?
[127:14.56]Why are people freaking out?
[127:18.15]What do you mean?
[127:18.51]What are you talking about?
[127:19.29]Those don't count.
[127:21.01]She's not even grabbing onto anything.
[127:23.38]Don't let them throw her off.
[127:24.38]Do you see her sitting right there?
[127:25.88]They're going to grab her and throw her off to make sure she doesn't get thrown off.
[127:30.18]Okay.
[127:34.24]Why is she hiding there?
[127:36.06]I don't know.
[127:36.40]Of all places to hide.
[127:38.27]She's good.
[127:38.57]She's good.
[127:43.85]Is that his wife?
[127:44.63]Who is that?
[127:45.13]I don't know, but she keeps teleporting out of the room.
[127:46.83]All right, we got to go.
[127:50.69]I think we're good.
[127:52.21]I think we're good.
[127:54.83]No, okay.
[127:55.75]Once the talc is like computer started to break.
[127:57.79]I think we're good.
[128:00.67]Correct me if I'm wrong.
[128:03.41]Oh, shit.
[128:03.87]What do you mean they got her?
[128:07.31]They got her.
[128:08.13]What?
[128:10.27]Watch out, watch out.
[128:10.82]Okay.
[128:13.00]They don't have her.
[128:14.26]She's standing right here.
[128:16.72]I'm on my way, honey.
[128:19.42]You know, they don't have her.
[128:21.18]I don't... Well, they're in front of her, I think.
[128:24.98]The general sentiment is that they're close to her.
[128:28.20]Well, she was... All right, well, I just picked off a bunch of people.
[128:34.35]That was... Uh-oh.
[128:36.55]Oh, don't let her get grabbed.
[128:40.77]Where are you?
[128:41.45]Oh, my goodness.
[128:42.65]Did you die?
[128:42.99]There's so many people.
[128:44.69]I'm about to.
[128:46.45]This guy just got blocked three times by the same piece of- Holy shit!
[128:50.79]Holy shit!
[128:52.45]Just stay alive.
[128:56.05]And I have the worst gun in the whole game.
[129:06.04]Oh my fucking god and we lose.
[129:09.62]We lose.
[129:10.62]I got a triple kill.
[129:11.32]Wait, we lose?
[129:11.90]We lose because I died up top because that fucking oompa loompa stretched out shot me like three times and I died.
[129:17.29]I was doing so well.
[129:18.43]Minus fucking five.
[129:21.53]Every time I alt tab now, I'm like nervous.
[129:27.41]Minus five.
[129:28.33]Okay.
[129:29.13]Hour and a half.
[129:29.73]We can do it.
[129:30.47]We can do this.
[129:31.01]We actually can.
[129:31.49]Watch out!
[129:35.97]Watch out, apparently.
[129:36.84]For what?
[129:37.48]Going down.
[129:39.06]I'm down.
[129:39.36]I'm up.
[129:40.24]Wait, are you okay?
[129:40.98]You alright?
[129:41.50]I'm okay.
[129:42.44]Oh, you know what?
[129:43.76]If we die again, don't go down.
[129:45.98]No, just go down.
[129:47.28]Just go down?
[129:48.70]Yeah, there's a lot more cover down here.
[129:50.73]Fucking oompa loompa.
[129:52.97]They're like charging me, and they have to run around this corner.
[129:56.67]I can't take cover.
[129:57.63]We're inside of each other.
[130:03.59]You forgot a guy.
[130:04.23]You forgot a guy back here.
[130:06.49]Hey, you know, that's why you're here.
[130:09.49]That's why I bring you along.
[130:10.81]Yeah, that's why Kane comes with Lynch.
[130:19.48]Dude, it wouldn't be so bad if they didn't, like, teleport the fuck all of... Okay, I thought that was you back here.
[130:24.46]He's in the same clothes.
[130:25.44]Dude is wearing the same fucking clothes.
[130:29.43]Oh, God, don't even tell me to... Jesus.
[130:34.90]Almost out of ammo.
[130:36.46]Oh, there's something there.
[130:38.06]It's like a horror game with all the Oompa Loompas closing in.
[130:41.73]This is a Left 4 Dead 2 mod.
[130:48.05]Gotta pick up all the guns.
[130:49.47]Careful.
[130:49.93]That guy up top is... No, we're not going to be able to ever hit that guy.
[130:53.98]No.
[130:54.20]The one, like, shooting with an airsoft rifle up there?
[130:59.58]You guys need to make a noise.
[131:02.82]Give me this gun.
[131:05.91]Easy.
[131:06.15]I'm okay.
[131:07.95]Easy.
[131:08.17]We're using professional strategies here.
[131:11.65]This is not a good strategy.
[131:12.45]You're going to get shot at a thousand times.
[131:13.71]No, we're good.
[131:15.99]Follow me.
[131:16.45]Shot the guy four times and he's still alive.
[131:18.63]Got him.
[131:19.75]Nice.
[131:20.13]Good strategy.
[131:21.33]Good strat.
[131:21.75]Let's go.
[131:25.11]What is that?
[131:27.49]No, it's not me.
[131:28.45]Okay, that's not you holding that.
[131:29.65]I just had a hostage.
[131:41.01]Don't do you.
[131:41.77]That's not a thing to say out loud.
[131:45.21]What is this camera actually doing?
[131:47.29]Alright, hold on.
[131:48.75]That wasn't Overwatch.
[131:49.69]Minus two for friendly fire.
[131:50.49]Alright, so that's minus four.
[132:05.77]Minus four plus ten is plus six.
[132:08.08]Did we get a plus six?
[132:09.96]Alright, plus six.
[132:11.20]We got a plus six out of it.
[132:16.00]Okay.
[132:20.07]So, if you betrayed me, how do we play this game in co-op?
[132:23.09]No, you betrayed me.
[132:24.09]No, you betrayed me.
[132:25.57]No, I was the guy that got betrayed.
[132:28.07]No, you got betrayed.
[132:28.97]No, you hit me.
[132:29.79]Yeah, I hit you.
[132:31.13]You're right.
[132:31.87]I got turned around.
[132:35.69]Why do we just keep hearing this, like, audio tape of somebody being murdered?
[132:40.77]Are you making a phone call?
[132:45.00]Who the fuck was just making a phone call?
[132:48.38]Oh, come on, that's minus 20!
[132:50.26]That's minus 20 for nudity!
[132:52.90]Fucking come on.
[132:54.81]That's full nudity.
[132:56.23]Am I nude too?
[132:57.71]I hope it's not minus 40.
[132:58.71]But where am I?
[133:02.90]You don't get to play, it's just me.
[133:04.22]What do you mean I don't get to play?
[133:07.65]I hope I- I swear to god I hope to fucking run in with like a naked body on my- I hope I'm naked too.
[133:15.18]Oh, here we go.
[133:17.24]I'm naked too.
[133:20.24]Is he naked?
[133:21.64]We have minus 40.
[133:25.77]Minus 40.
[133:26.69]I'm choking out.
[133:28.89]But hold on a second.
[133:29.77]Like, where did we get here?
[133:31.27]I don't know.
[133:32.81]They captured us.
[133:34.05]Because I knocked you out because I didn't want us to die.
[133:37.71]So just take a second here.
[133:39.42]Hold on.
[133:40.16]Wait for the cut scene to be over.
[133:41.82]I want to see if there's any more nudity.
[133:43.80]If there's another naked person, it might be over.
[133:47.70]Lynch.
[133:50.92]Lynch.
[133:51.36]Do you have to pee yet?
[133:55.93]Lynch.
[133:56.53]Are you asking because we're in a bathroom right now?
[133:58.41]There's another naked person.
[133:59.49]It's minus 60.
[133:59.89]There's another naked person.
[134:01.25]Oh, shit.
[134:02.45]Minus 60.
[134:02.87]Oh, my God.
[134:04.93]It's unreasonable.
[134:06.15]No.
[134:06.46]You can't take an hour off.
[134:10.60]Okay.
[134:11.68]What is that?
[134:13.22]Oh, that's the wife.
[134:14.55]I'll tab minus 60.
[134:15.49]That's the wife.
[134:16.15]That's why he's like grunting, right?
[134:18.45]That's his wife.
[134:19.15]Yeah, that's a one, two, three, four.
[134:23.03]So.
[134:23.53]Minus 60.
[134:23.99]So mine's a whole hour.
[134:25.53]Mine's a whole hour.
[134:26.35]What were you at?
[134:27.05]Because when I got to one hour.
[134:28.27]We're at 27.
[134:28.47]We're at 27 minutes.
[134:32.50]Do we get any back for, like, the hilarity of having three naked people in a row?
[134:36.98]Okay, we get plus two for how funny it is to have three naked people, okay?
[134:41.14]Like, back-to-back.
[134:42.08]In the same scene.
[134:43.02]So that puts 28-29, so we're at 29 minutes.
[134:44.76]We're at 29 minutes now.
[134:47.68]I have to get down to 29 because I can't.
[134:49.94]Okay, now I can.
[134:51.62]We only have 29 minutes to beat the game.
[134:53.64]We have 29 minutes to complete this game.
[134:55.96]So, uh, I gotta pee.
[134:57.54]Do you have to pee?
[134:58.96]No.
[135:00.69]Guys, can we get a pee pause?
[135:02.41]Pee pause?
[135:03.13]Can we get a pee pause?
[135:04.18]Come on.
[135:04.80]We just lost 60 fucking minutes.
[135:09.04]People are saying round up to an even 30.
[135:13.16]We got to get a pee pause.
[135:14.00]No pee pause?
[135:17.35]No pee pause.
[135:19.35]No pee pause.
[135:20.13]No pee pause.
[135:20.91]Do you have to pee?
[135:23.01]No.
[135:23.65]I have to pee.
[135:24.11]We're not getting a pee pause, but I'm going to be as fast as I can.
[135:26.55]Okay.
[135:27.90]You want me to stay here?
[135:28.54]I'm gonna stay here.
[135:29.12]No pee pause.
[135:30.32]I'll be right back.
[135:30.88]I'm gonna stay in this... Don't do anything not funny while I'm gone, because we don't want to lose any time.
[135:36.54]If I hear about a joke that you did that wasn't fucking funny, I'm gonna be really upset.
[135:39.40]Oh, come on.
[135:40.32]The full-on, like, nude sprint.
[135:44.69]It's pretty funny.
[135:47.69]Because right now, they have a little bit of shame.
[135:49.67]Like, if you just let them stand still, they're kind of half-heartedly covering themselves.
[135:56.23]But then...
[135:58.87]Full sprint.
[136:01.93]All of my shame is gone.
[136:04.30]They were recording us, too?
[136:08.04]Okay.
[136:09.28]Alright.
[136:10.44]Well, guys, listen here.
[136:12.32]If we lose 60 minutes for nudity, we may as well make those 60 minutes count, you know?
[136:18.27]Like, just take it all in.
[136:19.29]I want you to just absorb every fine detail.
[136:27.14]Every cut.
[136:28.62]Every bloody gash.
[136:30.64]Every pixel on that woman.
[136:33.52]Gotta get your money's worth, after all.
[136:37.46]Quick.
[136:38.93]Make some jokes.
[136:41.63]Um.
[136:46.87]If I just stay quiet, then I can't lose any points.
[136:51.65]If I just don't talk, then I can't lose any points.
[136:55.50]We've only got 30 minutes.
[137:01.67]Why does my game look so much better?
[137:04.33]Did he not turn the graphic settings up?
[137:09.05]I want him to go into video options.
[137:12.63]They're probably all on low.
[137:15.76]I heard the door.
[137:16.20]I'm not fooling anybody.
[137:20.20]Your screen is way more red.
[137:28.20]Okay.
[137:29.98]Is that good or bad?
[137:33.20]Hang on, hang on.
[137:34.00]Important phone call coming in right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[137:36.24]Hold on.
[137:36.82]Put this on speaker.
[137:38.44]I'm on speakerphone?
[137:39.28]You are on speakerphone.
[137:40.82]I locked myself out of my fucking house.
[137:44.47]No.
[137:45.39]I locked myself out of my house.
[137:47.03]No, no.
[137:47.95]This is all just an elaborate joke, right?
[137:49.63]I can't get back in my house.
[137:51.19]I locked myself out of my house.
[137:55.74]Okay.
[137:56.60]Do you need me to call somebody?
[138:00.34]Do it.
[138:08.08]Just got us more time.
[138:09.88]Just got us more time.
[138:11.28]That was a fucking plus 10 joke.
[138:12.52]All right, I'm hanging up.
[138:14.36]I got us more time, Vitalik.
[138:17.81]That's a plus 10.
[138:20.59]That is a fucking plus 10.
[138:21.69]So are we taking it to mean that you had to go outside to use the bathroom?
[138:26.23]Yeah, but that's a plus 10 joke.
[138:28.11]I was like, I'm stuck outside.
[138:30.05]I'm going to lose time.
[138:31.63]All right, so we're at 36.
[138:36.64]36 up my graphics what do you mean up my graphics uh people who came to my game said that yours looks has been looking like garbage this entire time wait what apparently the color red does not exist in your stream wait wait what like are we really red and bloody right now like bright red what do we look like to you in game I mean I'm at like I'm at like a high bit rate
[139:02.39]No, no, no.
[139:03.51]Look at me in the game.
[139:05.97]Are we bright red right now?
[139:07.57]No.
[139:08.93]Because we should be bright, bloody red.
[139:11.27]What do you mean?
[139:12.55]Disgusting, bloody red.
[139:16.89]Listen, I told everyone what I was going to do.
[139:19.57]We get 10 points if I'm right.
[139:22.14]We get plus 10 if you're right.
[139:23.64]If I'm right about this, we get plus 10.
[139:25.60]okay all right you have to hit escape yeah go to options yeah go to video yeah click on more settings okay what what are they at are you on all low
[139:38.31]No.
[139:39.39]What do you want?
[139:41.09]Anti-acid disabled.
[139:44.80]Plus two.
[139:46.88]Anisotropy.
[139:50.38]Why are you learning?
[139:52.12]Do you play PC video games?
[139:53.08]I'm trying to get us more time.
[139:55.88]What's your level of detail and shadow of detail?
[139:59.65]If people laugh, hi.
[140:02.47]They're both at high?
[140:03.03]They're both at high, yes.
[140:04.43]All right, I guess I lose points.
[140:05.46]So if I was going to gain 10, I guess I lose 10.
[140:08.72]Shadow detail high, level detail high, full screen effects enabled.
[140:11.84]What's going on?
[140:15.16]I don't know.
[140:15.94]We're both very red.
[140:17.37]You're supposed to be bloody gross red.
[140:21.97]We look like Halloween characters right now.
[140:25.49]Are you sure that's not just your computer?
[140:27.33]Okay, I think I'm not going to say what I just was going to say.
[140:30.75]All right, so we are at, so that's 36, right?
[140:36.08]Because that was a pretty funny joke.
[140:39.68]Yeah, we're at 36.
[140:40.54]Yeah.
[140:41.06]All right, let's go.
[140:42.52]We have to beat this game in 36 minutes.
[140:44.68]Wait, Gamma, what do you mean Gamma?
[140:45.72]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Gamma.
[140:48.00]You have full screen effects disabled.
[140:50.08]He has it enabled.
[140:52.77]So wait, if I disable full screen effects, we're gonna turn red.
[140:58.65]Let's see what that looks like.
[141:01.21]Oh wow, you've been playing like this the whole game?
[141:05.53]Yeah.
[141:05.69]You've been playing with like a green film the entire game.
[141:10.24]Like a bad college movie film.
[141:12.90]Wait, what?
[141:15.16]Turn it off.
[141:16.48]Why is this on?
[141:17.76]Wait, why is this called full screen effects?
[141:21.39]Because they just put, like, a film grain over it.
[141:24.85]What?
[141:26.29]Yeah, you gotta disable full screen effects.
[141:29.07]It just looks like a shitty, like, college movie.
[141:32.15]I know, that's what I'm, that's what I just said.
[141:34.71]Minus two for the same joke.
[141:35.91]No, no, no, I thought the same thing, that's parallel thinking.
[141:38.71]But it was plus two for the joke, minus two for the same joke.
[141:41.28]Alright, well, thanks.
[141:42.50]Alright, I don't, I don't, don't ask me what, whatever.
[141:45.38]Okay, now, like, we have, like, graphics, I guess.
[141:48.02]yeah so we've got graphics so we're at plus two right uh for what for yeah sure sure yeah we're plus two we just keep getting 32 minutes we've been in this bathroom for like 10 minutes we keep getting back to 36 how are you at 36 what do you mean 34 we did I just added two yeah I just did two add two again we're at 36 all right 36 let's go
[142:13.51]Let's go with actual graphics.
[142:15.07]Okay.
[142:15.59]We're on actual graphics.
[142:16.60]I mean, look how disgusting we are by comparison to the gray goo that you were watching before.
[142:22.20]Why the hell was that on by default?
[142:23.54]I don't know, but you've been playing the entire game with it.
[142:26.32]I didn't see an issue with it.
[142:27.52]I thought it was just kind of ugly.
[142:30.68]Whose blood is this?
[142:32.40]I didn't have an issue.
[142:33.76]I didn't have an issue.
[142:34.40]I just thought it was ugly.
[142:35.49]I thought the game was fucking... Why are all of these doors open?
[142:38.01]I don't know.
[142:38.57]I thought it was just a 2010 ugly game.
[142:43.41]Is this shit on fire?
[142:44.57]Oh no, it's raining.
[142:49.39]It's only raining in one direction, though.
[142:51.91]Okay.
[142:52.11]It's raining that way, but it's not raining this way.
[142:55.71]This is making me claustrophobic.
[142:56.91]We gotta get, like, out of here.
[142:58.97]We don't have very much time, either.
[143:00.09]We have to get the fuck out of here.
[143:01.11]I was hoping if we stood out in the rain that we'd wash off all the blood.
[143:04.57]It wants us to go this way.
[143:06.39]Like, when you hold down Y, it says escape.
[143:08.17]I'm getting motion sick right now running through these doors.
[143:10.89]Me too.
[143:11.11]We gotta get the fuck out of here.
[143:14.98]Which way does it want us to go?
[143:15.80]This way.
[143:16.22]Follow me.
[143:18.30]Where did you go?
[143:19.00]In this door.
[143:19.50]Oh.
[143:20.14]Yeah.
[143:21.68]So many bicycles in closets.
[143:25.46]Two naked guys lift open a gate.
[143:28.72]I know, honestly.
[143:31.26]And we're good.
[143:32.74]Yeah, why didn't we just take the other guy's clothes?
[143:35.70]I don't know.
[143:36.00]That's a good question.
[143:37.24]Those dead guys were clothed.
[143:38.68]Why are we sneaking?
[143:41.72]I guess we don't have any guns.
[143:42.72]Escape the parking lot.
[143:45.30]All right, I'm gonna run something by you here.
[143:48.76]Sprint.
[143:50.44]Okay, three, two, one, sprint.
[143:55.56]Minus two for bad pun, gonna run something by you.
[143:58.57]No, no, this way.
[144:00.63]Two naked guys trying to escape.
[144:13.87]I got a hostage.
[144:15.03]Alright.
[144:15.43]Do you have a gun?
[144:17.27]I had a hostage.
[144:18.11]I got a gun.
[144:18.53]I got a gun.
[144:20.17]You picked up the one that I was... Help.
[144:25.84]Help.
[144:26.94]Okay, good thing that guy was a fucking idiot.
[144:29.18]And Elvis over there doesn't know we're shooting.
[144:31.68]There's a guy behind you.
[144:35.44]Got him.
[144:36.56]Watch out for Elvis.
[144:38.12]Fuck, that was awful.
[144:39.08]God damn it, that's minus two.
[144:41.57]My throat is bothering me, so I can't...
[144:45.27]What?
[144:46.99]Oh, that was so bad.
[144:48.15]My throat is like, I'm really like hoarse right now, so I can't do it.
[144:51.22]Did you just go, uh-huh?
[144:52.68]I went, I went, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[144:54.42]It just didn't fucking work because my throat is all fucked up.
[144:56.42]Minus two.
[144:57.00]31.
[144:57.86]31.
[144:57.98]We got half an hour.
[145:02.58]We got half an hour to beat the whole game.
[145:04.08]Watch out for the fucking guy in the... Just do as I say.
[145:08.02]Ah, he's talking about nudity.
[145:09.76]All right, we gotta go this way.
[145:11.29]I can't believe we lost 60 minutes.
[145:14.77]It's too much nudity, man.
[145:18.23]I knew there was gonna be too much nudity, too.
[145:20.58]Well, if we can... Think about it.
[145:21.54]If we can beat the next, like, four or five levels in ten minutes, we'll gain ten minutes.
[145:25.78]You know what I'm saying?
[145:27.76]Yeah.
[145:29.11]Why do I... Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[145:30.83]I feel like we're actually pretty close.
[145:33.30]We might be.
[145:33.64]Because the main character's wife that we've been chasing the whole time just died.
[145:37.66]Yeah.
[145:38.18]Usually in the story, that means.
[145:39.71]We're about to have, like, one final get-even with the bad guys who did it.
[145:44.61]Hold on.
[145:44.99]Sneak, sneak, sneak.
[145:47.13]We don't want to have any unnecessary deaths here.
[145:49.54]I think if we just walk out there, then we won't draw too much attention.
[145:53.02]This one guy in the car is freaking out about this.
[145:56.04]Okay, what do we got?
[145:58.91]We have to shoot.
[146:00.07]You're dead.
[146:01.37]I am too, in like five seconds.
[146:03.29]No, you're fine.
[146:04.55]Fuck, that was a civilian.
[146:05.41]That's minus one.
[146:08.77]There's one in the car, in the driver's seat, so watch out.
[146:10.89]Don't shoot him.
[146:11.57]There's a guy right behind him.
[146:13.27]Ow, ow, ow, ow.
[146:16.99]I'm going to get him.
[146:18.17]We didn't forget the plus ten from last level, did we?
[146:20.31]I don't think so.
[146:21.85]Did we forget the plus ten?
[146:22.99]Did we?
[146:23.92]I don't think we did.
[146:24.52]I think we added it because...
[146:27.01]I think we added it.
[146:28.11]I think we did too.
[146:28.63]Pretty sure we did it.
[146:30.27]I thought so.
[146:36.37]I'm sorry.
[146:36.81]I'm sorry.
[146:38.41]Where are we keeping the guns?
[146:40.17]Uh oh.
[146:40.95]I just saved your life.
[146:45.48]I just need a better gun.
[146:46.42]That's all I need.
[146:47.16]Dude, you owe me a plus one.
[146:49.38]Dinner.
[146:49.68]Did I just kill a civilian?
[146:53.82]No.
[146:55.57]No, we're good.
[146:56.17]We only lost one, but I haven't added it yet or subtracted it.
[146:58.41]This guy is... How's the food here?
[147:00.88]Oh, it's a tasty looking burger.
[147:10.11]Don't do it.
[147:11.98]I shot him in the foot.
[147:14.64]I shot him in the fucking foot and I didn't... Not funny.
[147:17.71]Just do minus two because we need to do minus two.
[147:19.75]He's not even dead.
[147:21.01]What do you mean he's not dead?
[147:22.79]He's not dead.
[147:23.19]He's still alive.
[147:23.57]What are you talking about?
[147:24.67]Schrodinger's civilian is here.
[147:27.33]For you, he is dead.
[147:28.17]For me, he's alive.
[147:29.27]He's alive on your screen.
[147:30.71]Yeah, so it cancels out.
[147:31.95]I didn't kill him.
[147:32.57]You did.
[147:33.03]Zero.
[147:33.43]Well, we still have a minus one from the first person.
[147:35.23]Now we're at 28.
[147:35.63]Okay.
[147:35.77]Minus one.
[147:42.46]Minus one, dinner's ruined.
[147:46.36]We gotta get off the streets!
[147:54.83]We gotta get off the streets!
[147:56.41]Alright, I'm gonna get the ketchup, you get the mustard.
[147:57.63]The entire police force is on the streets.
[147:59.09]Get the mustard.
[148:00.97]What?
[148:01.59]I get the ketchup, you get the mustard.
[148:03.17]Oh.
[148:06.05]Alright, you ready?
[148:08.24]They're just gonna shoot it and we're gonna explode.
[148:10.36]Get it out there.
[148:10.84]We gotta make a fucking, we gotta make a police hamburger.
[148:12.88]You threw it right here.
[148:14.22]I killed a guy by throwing it.
[148:15.42]It hit him right in the leg and it killed him.
[148:16.46]I don't know what you're talking about.
[148:17.69]I saw it on my screen right here.
[148:18.67]There's another one.
[148:19.99]Sorry, I got it.
[148:20.39]Bowling ball.
[148:22.29]Bowling ball.
[148:23.29]I got a bowling ball.
[148:24.43]That's so cool.
[148:27.23]You see my bowling ball?
[148:28.41]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[148:31.37]We gotta get rid of that.
[148:32.11]I gotta get rid of that.
[148:33.09]Okay, we're good.
[148:33.93]Now throw that bowling ball in somebody's fucking head.
[148:36.22]Okay, I gotta get close to them.
[148:37.34]So you need to cover me and like leave one guy alive.
[148:39.85]Okay.
[148:42.07]The guy, the team over here to the left.
[148:43.65]The far guy.
[148:44.25]This far guy.
[148:44.77]Right in the head.
[148:47.61]Right in the head.
[148:50.06]No, give me back.
[148:50.78]I want my bowling ball back.
[148:52.28]Oh, there's so many of them, dude.
[148:53.68]There's like a thousand of them now.
[148:55.20]Pick me up.
[148:56.44]Oh, shit.
[148:57.56]Oh, shit.
[148:58.23]I got you.
[149:02.46]I got the worst, oh, I just got the worst angle in the whole game with my death angle.
[149:07.34]Oh my god, that was plus two for the fucking ketchup and mustard joke, and that's minus five for you dying.
[149:12.57]If you saw, well, come on.
[149:15.25]No, this doesn't count, this doesn't count, if we die here.
[149:19.71]I just, I think I just earned another minus 20 for nudity.
[149:23.87]Wait, what do you mean?
[149:26.65]I think I just earned another minus 20 for nudity.
[149:28.71]How, how, did you like see his dick?
[149:31.39]No, I saw up, like, just behind that.
[149:36.11]Like, just underneath it.
[149:37.47]Just full eagle spread.
[149:39.15]Close up view.
[149:41.79]No, it doesn't matter.
[149:42.38]I didn't see it.
[149:42.98]Of his hairless butthole.
[149:47.00]Okay.
[149:47.46]Like, full view.
[149:48.84]No blur.
[149:49.58]There was no blur.
[149:50.38]Get these tanks out of here.
[149:52.48]Okay, no, don't shoot that tank.
[149:55.82]I'm going for a bowling ball kill on this guy over here on the right.
[149:58.44]So leave everybody alive with the guy on the right.
[150:03.78]Oh, okay, so this is my job.
[150:05.40]Yeah, yeah.
[150:06.38]You failed it last time.
[150:07.84]Guy on the right over here, I'm going to throw the bowling ball in space.
[150:09.52]Hey, you were supposed to be covering me.
[150:10.40]I was told there was one guy left.
[150:12.26]I thought you were just taking a shit for a second.
[150:13.65]I swear to God.
[150:16.19]I can't see any of these guys.
[150:18.25]I can help.
[150:18.79]I can help.
[150:19.67]Hang on.
[150:22.59]Get rid of these guys.
[150:23.21]There's like four of them here now.
[150:29.14]I'm going to try to sneak up with the bowling ball.
[150:31.08]How many guys are left?
[150:32.95]At least two or three.
[150:33.97]Okay.
[150:34.49]I got a guy right there.
[150:35.55]Don't kill that guy.
[150:37.70]That guy... There's this guy right here.
[150:40.54]Keep him distracted.
[150:42.08]Good work.
[150:44.06]How do I throw the bowling ball?
[150:46.68]Excuse me.
[150:49.90]That was so... That was not... You know what?
[150:52.49]That sucks because that's a fucking minus two.
[150:54.51]That's a minus two.
[150:55.65]That's so unfortunate.
[150:56.67]If we had just done it on the first try.
[150:58.39]That's a minus fucking two.
[151:00.19]It would have been worth it.
[151:03.08]Okay, minus two.
[151:04.08]God damn it.
[151:04.84]Okay.
[151:05.38]We're at 22 minutes and 37 seconds.
[151:09.01]22?
[151:09.03]I'm at 19.
[151:10.79]How are you at 19?
[151:12.85]Is it because we died?
[151:13.95]Yeah, we died.
[151:15.09]You died, so it was minus five.
[151:17.57]Then I'm at 17 now.
[151:19.77]No, it's 19.
[151:21.53]Because you died.
[151:23.75]Whatever.
[151:24.09]We're at 19.
[151:24.95]Fair enough.
[151:26.73]We have to do something good.
[151:28.77]We have to.
[151:29.39]We can't do anything else bad.
[151:30.66]We've got to gain some... No, we have to do something fun and interesting.
[151:32.86]We've got to gain some, like... We've got to do something to get, like, plus 5 or plus 10.
[151:36.26]Well, the only new weapon that we've been given in, like, an hour and a half is a purple bowling ball.
[151:40.98]So we have to make a Twitch TV bowling ball joke.
[151:43.20]It's important.
[151:44.66]Where do we go?
[151:45.00]Open the door.
[151:45.66]Come over here.
[151:46.14]Shit, we're going to lose the bowling ball.
[151:54.01]Trust me when I say this, Alex.
[151:54.93]I'm trying to get plus two points here.
[151:57.41]It's not gonna work.
[151:57.97]Okay, we gotta go.
[151:59.09]You might have just cost us more points.
[152:01.69]Why?
[152:01.95]You shouldn't have said anything.
[152:02.95]You should have just done it, and if it was funny, then we got... Why is this a nude cutscene?
[152:08.58]Oh, wait.
[152:09.20]Oh, no.
[152:11.76]What happened to the censor?
[152:12.60]I thought that was another naked guy.
[152:17.93]Okay.
[152:20.91]I thought it just panned out to another naked guy.
[152:23.47]You better be careful because they don't censor anything except the penis.
[152:28.37]That would have been so funny if it had panned out.
[152:35.22]Can we hurry up with the cutscene?
[152:36.44]We don't have very much time.
[152:39.12]We might be about to beat a level, so we might get ten minutes.
[152:41.28]I hope so.
[152:49.55]Can I just say, this game is really bad.
[152:53.99]That sensor is going down real far.
[152:58.02]Like, honestly.
[152:58.62]I think that the morbid cuts, like the lacerations with blood is more disturbing than what that is filtering.
[153:07.63]Yeah, I know.
[153:09.45]I've gotten adjusted to it at this point.
[153:10.92]Dude, this guy's... Look at how big that fucking blur is.
[153:14.78]Holy shit.
[153:18.40]Might be giving him a little too much credit.
[153:21.24]I don't know, man.
[153:24.02]They might be giving you a little... Okay, won't go there.
[153:26.83]Plus two.
[153:27.31]People are saying plus two for the well-endowed.
[153:28.99]All right, they're asking for it, right?
[153:33.89]Okay, plus two.
[153:34.69]We're at 19.
[153:34.99]We're at 19.
[153:37.23]Okay.
[153:37.61]And counting.
[153:38.53]We're good.
[153:38.87]Let's go.

[154:09.42]This is just a series.

[154:14.67]No.

[154:47.09]Moving up.
[154:47.60]Fucking guy disappeared.
[154:48.44]This is serious right now.
[154:50.22]There's no time for jokes.
[154:51.58]Oh, no.
[154:52.10]There's no time for jokes.
[154:52.94]Oh, there's so many people.
[154:54.08]I don't have any bullets.
[154:54.90]Do you have any bullets?
[154:57.08]Holy shit.
[154:57.58]That was at least a triple kill.
[154:59.28]I'm in trouble.
[154:59.84]I'm in trouble.
[155:00.17]I'm in trouble.
[155:00.49]I'm down.
[155:01.29]Oh, no, you're not.
[155:02.13]Oh, don't say such a thing.
[155:03.39]I'm up.

[155:04.49]Fuck.
[155:05.31]I'm down.

[155:06.65]No, you're not.
[155:07.47]Run.
[155:08.15]Run to the back.
[155:08.51]Run to the back.
[155:08.83]We gotta, like, pick up, like, a gun or something.
[155:10.17]I got a gun.
[155:11.37]Get in the bathroom.
[155:13.16]Get in the bathroom.
[155:13.62]Get in the stall.
[155:13.98]There's a gun right there in the wall.
[155:15.32]I got it.
[155:16.38]Alright, we gotta, like, just feed him into here, right?
[155:19.22]Holy shit.
[155:19.94]Okay, I'm gonna get this side.
[155:20.82]You get that side.
[155:23.89]No, no, no, no.
[155:25.15]I got a gun.
[155:25.85]I got an actual gun now.
[155:26.55]You have an actual gun.
[155:27.33]Good.
[155:29.03]We cannot die here.
[155:30.25]There's not enough time.
[155:31.79]There is not enough time.
[155:32.49]You're right.
[155:35.52]That guy was hiding behind the corpse of his dead friend.
[155:38.42]This has to be the end of the game.
[155:39.36]They're sniping me.
[155:42.00]There's two guys over here.
[155:45.34]Oh, shit.
[155:45.86]In my underwear.
[155:46.38]Okay, we're good.
[155:51.27]Easy.
[155:51.85]There's a million people over there, by the way.
[155:55.15]Yeah, I think that there's a couple of explosives somewhere.
[156:05.44]There is a bad joke here.
[156:06.86]I'm not going to make it.
[156:07.70]What do you mean a bad joke?
[156:08.52]There's a bad joke right here.
[156:10.38]I'm not going to make it.
[156:11.18]I don't know.
[156:13.06]Show me.
[156:13.38]We could gain some time.
[156:14.00]No.
[156:15.22]That's why I'm not going to... This is about the cheeseburgers, so it's about the burgers, right?
[156:26.77]Plead the fifth.
[156:29.66]Where's this last guy?
[156:30.48]Right in the back.
[156:31.22]Okay, we gotta... Plead the fifth.
[156:32.82]Plead the fifth.
[156:34.16]I plead the fifth.
[156:40.09]Shitting non-existent underwear.
[156:41.47]Is there... How are you... There's still people out here.
[156:45.19]How the fuck are you still living?
[156:46.83]I don't understand this.
[156:51.41]Okay, that guy, is he dead?
[156:52.75]Actually dead?
[156:53.13]This is like a... Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[156:54.80]We're gonna run out of time just sitting in this room.
[156:57.48]Don't.
[156:58.44]Please don't do that to me.
[157:00.80]I got it.
[157:01.24]Okay, you did it.
[157:01.74]So, who's left out here?
[157:02.58]No, they're still alive.
[157:03.54]There's two people behind the supercar.
[157:05.36]I can't... There's one.
[157:07.34]There's more than... There's two over there.
[157:08.92]There's two.
[157:09.78]Watch out, guys.
[157:10.80]There's like four.
[157:11.64]They keep popping their heads up like fucking gophers, dude.
[157:15.10]Oh, I hear more.
[157:16.18]I hear more.
[157:16.92]Where are they?
[157:18.78]Do you hear that?
[157:19.32]I think we're doing it.
[157:20.78]We're doing it?
[157:23.60]We just gotta escape, right?
[157:24.56]We just gotta move.
[157:25.02]I think we did it.
[157:25.74]Did we beat the game?
[157:26.52]I think we did.
[157:28.59]Uh, let's find out.
[157:30.37]Uh-oh, they're putting on clothes.
[157:32.27]That's a bad sign.
[157:33.13]Oh, no, we have more.
[157:34.45]That means there's more.
[157:35.43]This might be a plus ten, though.
[157:37.27]It might be a plus ten.
[157:38.13]They seem really quiet.
[157:43.44]Is the cameraman also nude?
[157:44.84]Probably.
[157:46.32]Probably.
[157:50.76]somebody just said we're not even halfway through the game yes we are we have to be everyone's saying we forgot the last level too like everybody's saying it if everyone's saying it then I guess well um is this us I think I just want to get this over and done I believe this is us this is like 10 years in the future is this is this just plus is this plus 10 minutes into the future

[158:30.96]Okay.
[158:35.83]Okay, plus 20, apparently.
[158:39.01]I don't think it was plus... I'm hearing people say... Yeah, we got... Someone else said we got six for the last level.
[158:46.01]Because we have to take off four.
[158:49.63]Obviously have to fight all the guys back there Racism oh god
[159:09.43]We didn't do it though, so... Alright, so apparently everyone is saying... Oh, we're fighting them.
[159:14.98]So we gotta have a second here and add 20 minutes.

[159:27.95]This guy in the tracksuit...
[159:32.11]That's you.
[159:33.09]That's you.
[159:33.43]The guy in the tracksuit.
[159:35.13]You're in like some really hot track pants.
[159:38.63]Oh, God.
[159:41.74]I thought it was an NPC.
[159:43.36]Okay.
[159:43.46]I'm going for mustard.
[159:44.26]Okay.
[159:47.30]Okay.
[159:48.52]I got the mustard.
[159:49.04]I'll shoot it.
[159:49.48]You throw it.
[159:49.90]I'll shoot it.
[159:50.18]Where do you think it should be?
[159:51.75]I'm going right up memory lane.
[159:55.19]Nice.
[159:57.61]Watch out, you're just standing there.
[159:59.03]I am just standing there.
[160:00.91]Talix, there's two more Ketchup and Mushrooms over there.
[160:03.01]I'm going to go right up memory lane.
[160:06.89]I'm good?
[160:07.39]We appear to be underneath some kind of blimp.
[160:09.89]I guess.
[160:12.20]Is that you?
[160:15.00]Alright, I got Ketchup.
[160:17.08]Alright, get him!
[160:19.82]That didn't look like a great throw, but nonetheless.
[160:24.37]Oh, that's not a place I need this.
[160:26.09]No, I know.
[160:26.73]That's kind of why I ran.
[160:28.06]Spicy honey Dijon!
[160:29.40]Uh, they're flanking left heavily.
[160:34.56]Fuck.
[160:36.74]Like, a lot.
[160:38.03]A lot of people.
[160:41.31]And you're telling me that this guy's fucking still alive.
[160:44.43]Do you see how many people have... They're so... Wait, you're... I'm coming.
[160:48.96]I can't make it.
[160:49.76]I'm...
[160:53.96]Can't afford any scrubs!
[160:56.88]That's plus two for the mustard joke.
[160:58.60]I'll tap.
[160:58.96]That's plus two for mustard.
[161:00.02]I didn't die.
[161:00.96]You didn't die, so that's minus five.
[161:02.50]Minus three.
[161:03.26]Alright, so you're twenty-eight, right?
[161:06.55]How?
[161:06.91]No, twenty-eight just now.
[161:08.79]Twenty-eight, fifty-eight?
[161:09.97]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[161:11.71]Okay.
[161:12.31]Ready to make some money?
[161:13.99]Skip.
[161:14.69]And we have to just play well.
[161:16.63]Play well.
[161:17.49]No fucking ketchup and mustard jokes.
[161:20.50]Plus two for the voice crack.
[161:22.44]Who, me?
[161:24.38]What?
[161:24.56]Is it the bad guy?
[161:26.39]This is the bad guy's right here.
[161:31.75]That guy?
[161:33.75]The guy that I just unloaded the fucking entire clip into who was the bad guy.
[161:36.92]Why did they give us one place of cover?
[161:42.68]I'm just gonna stay back here, man.
[161:43.84]Fuck it.
[161:45.61]Okay, I moved up a little bit.
[161:53.80]Can I just say that this game really sucks?
[161:56.40]I mean, it does.
[161:57.04]This game is fucking bad.
[161:58.48]But that's the challenge.
[162:01.40]I know.
[162:01.97]That is the challenge.
[162:02.67]You're right.
[162:03.05]That's the challenge.
[162:08.29]The 2010 challenge.
[162:09.45]This really is.
[162:11.41]I think I killed that guy, but he's back alive.
[162:14.67]He's dead.
[162:20.90]All right.
[162:21.66]Can I ask chat for like a game opinion?
[162:24.40]Yeah.
[162:24.76]A different game.
[162:25.44]For a different bad era game.
[162:26.96]Game opinion.
[162:27.70]Let's hear it.
[162:28.88]Well, I've told you already.
[162:29.96]I just want to know what the general opinion is.
[162:32.36]If it would be worth doing.
[162:34.77]Okay.
[162:35.63]Similar challenge.
[162:37.75]For 50 cent blood on the sand.
[162:41.91]Does that game have multiplayer?
[162:44.25]Yeah.
[162:44.57]It has online co-op.
[162:45.49]Does it actually work?
[162:47.63]It's basically this.
[162:49.01]It's this, this, this.
[162:52.53]It's awful.
[162:54.12]Dude, back then it was fun.
[162:55.26]I can't kill this guy.
[162:56.28]He's just a bullet sponge.
[162:58.98]What am I playing?
[162:59.50]What am I playing?
[163:00.10]Fucking Destiny?
[163:00.88]I don't want to be the guy.
[163:02.34]I don't want to be the guy.
[163:03.60]What do you mean?
[163:04.64]Don't lose.
[163:05.00]I almost died.
[163:05.72]Don't do that.
[163:06.28]Okay, get to cover.
[163:10.23]Get good cover because there's a lot of people coming.
[163:12.17]I am in great cover.
[163:13.13]You are?
[163:13.65]But I don't have any guns.
[163:15.01]So I'm going to run back to you.
[163:15.69]Oh, you're over there.
[163:16.15]Okay.
[163:16.39]Please don't die.
[163:20.07]I got to like find a gun.
[163:21.71]Any gun.
[163:23.43]I'm getting a lot of yeses.
[163:24.55]Easy, easy, easy.
[163:28.73]We don't have to do this dumb shit again.
[163:30.39]I have 47 bullets in this gun.
[163:32.14]Good.
[163:33.08]Good, good, good, good, good.
[163:36.00]Alright.
[163:36.60]I got a lot of yeses.
[163:38.56]It might be worth it.
[163:46.10]If this is the end of the game, this is the most boring end of the game I've ever seen.
[163:51.36]This is the end.
[163:53.43]I'm going to laugh my ass off.
[163:54.57]You were just trying to shoot that guy, weren't you?
[163:57.47]The one over here?
[163:58.45]The one on the left.
[163:59.37]There's one bullet?
[164:00.53]You're going to give me a gun with one bullet?
[164:04.93]That's the gun I put down.
[164:07.43]Cover me, please.
[164:08.11]I need to get some ammo.
[164:10.41]Is this a boat?
[164:12.79]I'm doing a great job covering you.
[164:16.14]You sure are.
[164:17.20]We've got to move up.
[164:19.70]There's two guys left right here.
[164:25.91]There's one.
[164:26.39]I think I got one.
[164:29.50]This guy on the top of the stairs.
[164:34.12]Is he still alive?
[164:35.54]He's on the left.
[164:36.58]Wait, no, is he?
[164:37.20]I think his gun is just still alive.
[164:39.06]Okay.
[164:42.24]I think we're doing it.
[164:43.67]Have we done it?
[164:45.67]No dumb mistakes.
[164:48.33]I knew he was there.
[164:49.11]I was hunting him down.
[164:50.39]Don't grab any of the mustard.
[164:52.57]Not worth it.
[164:54.52]So where do we go?
[164:54.88]I mean, you're right, but I don't know.
[164:57.68]Is there a spot on the left over here?
[165:01.00]Down?
[165:01.26]I don't know.
[165:02.00]I guess?
[165:03.86]Yeah, here it is.
[165:05.51]Open the door.
[165:10.51]I tried to press E. You need to make a bunch of good jokes to make it through the rest of the game.
[165:17.65]Yeah, how much time do we have left?
[165:19.03]I don't know, like fucking 30 minutes?
[165:20.33]25 minutes?
[165:20.55]I can't see the timer.
[165:23.76]Unless I alt tag.
[165:24.50]Are we supposed to be sprinting over here?
[165:29.48]Wait, bad guys?
[165:31.08]No, dead guys.
[165:40.92]Why are my bullets not hitting anyone?
[165:43.91]I don't know.
[165:45.15]There we go.
[165:45.51]You got like silly blanks or something?
[165:46.77]What's going on here?
[165:48.07]We gotta move too.
[165:48.89]We have to move.
[165:50.55]This way.
[165:50.73]I'm getting a little bit stressed out from how serious this became.
[165:54.41]This is dead serious.
[165:55.19]I thought you said it wasn't worth it.
[165:59.67]Dead serious.
[166:00.37]It's like style points.
[166:01.31]Watch out, there's a guy.
[166:04.18]This is new.
[166:04.82]This is a new type of co-op moment.
[166:06.58]Yep, new big giant door.
[166:09.38]Oh, they had to do a custom animation just for that.
[166:13.16]Yeah.
[166:13.78]Somebody had to stay overnight to fucking do that one.
[166:19.08]Oh, we're trying to catch the main, like, penguin.
[166:21.46]We're trying to catch the penguin.
[166:23.15]We're trying to catch the riddler.
[166:26.91]Alright, where is he?
[166:28.99]No, he looks like the penguin.
[166:32.41]I got no time for jokes.
[166:36.44]I'm okay.
[166:36.82]I'm okay.
[166:37.66]Don't worry about me.
[166:42.96]Just spray around every corner.
[166:43.98]We're good.
[166:45.42]Cut scene.
[166:45.92]Are we pre-fired?
[166:48.74]There he is.
[166:50.40]Shoot him.
[166:50.90]Why would you let him do that?
[166:53.42]Wait, wait.
[166:56.38]I thought he was dead.
[166:58.94]He just lunges over and dies.
[167:01.85]That's plus two.
[167:02.93]Yeah, that's definitely plus two.
[167:09.95]You'd have done the same.
[167:11.23]We can't skip cutscenes.
[167:12.31]That's part of the rules.
[167:16.41]Yeah, we're this far into it.
[167:17.71]I kind of have to know.
[167:25.29]You shot him in the leg.
[167:26.63]I didn't shoot him.
[167:28.07]It was that guy.
[167:30.09]Oh, I thought you shot him.
[167:31.81]He was murdered before he could tell us the secret.
[167:34.64]I've got a plane.
[167:37.06]And his new military people.
[167:38.90]Add two.
[167:39.38]We're at like 24 and change.
[167:40.22]Alright, add two.
[167:41.46]Yeah.
[167:42.36]Yeah.
[167:42.64]Alright, I'm gonna- I'm with the FAMAS.
[167:49.35]I don't- I don't- I don't- These are military men now.
[167:51.63]Yep.
[167:52.23]You can- Everybody knows, in every game, once the military shows up, you're at the last level.
[168:00.59]The military's here.
[168:01.37]We have to be getting close to the end of the game.
[168:03.68]The military's here.
[168:04.20]They're like, clean up the- clean it up!
[168:05.82]Clean up the waste!
[168:09.40]Send in the troops!
[168:14.81]I thought that the guy that just died was the main bad guy of the game.
[168:19.84]He died in the most anticlimactic way possible.
[168:22.52]But he's not, I guess.
[168:23.60]I'm going to have to do some tank over here.
[168:26.02]I'm going to throw it down there.
[168:28.30]Perfect spot.
[168:28.95]Get that.
[168:29.71]Oh, you're going to shoot that tank.
[168:33.07]Kallax.
[168:33.37]My screen is blood red right now.
[168:35.65]Kallax, what have you done?
[168:36.45]There.
[168:37.55]Don't shoot.
[168:38.73]Don't.
[168:39.51]Watch where you're shooting that gun.
[168:45.43]I killed at least five people with that blast, by the way.
[168:47.85]Good.
[168:48.89]That's at least one point.
[168:51.85]That was another point.
[168:54.47]Yeah, that was pretty sick.
[169:00.17]What?
[169:00.61]Where'd it go?
[169:04.79]Anybody left?
[169:05.27]One guy?
[169:06.87]Two guys?
[169:07.78]Three guys?
[169:08.14]Three.
[169:08.26]More than three.
[169:09.04]In excess of three.
[169:14.22]All right, let's keep going.
[169:14.85]We got no time to spare.
[169:16.41]No time to spare.
[169:17.59]We really don't, though.
[169:18.63]There's like 20 minutes.
[169:19.67]Up top, up top.
[169:20.61]One random brainless guy.
[169:25.93]I need to find the gun.
[169:27.08]I feel like that guy was coming to help us.
[169:29.76]He kind of looked like he was on our team.
[169:32.32]Watch out.
[169:32.62]I got a FAMAS.
[169:38.64]Me too.
[169:41.33]I'm okay.
[169:49.76]Every single time we get a new iteration of bad guys, they just have more health than the last bad guys, and there's more of them.
[169:56.62]I know.
[169:57.58]What's the game here?
[169:58.40]All right.
[169:59.40]This is going to be big.
[170:03.87]The one that collapsed on the ground before you even got to blow him up.
[170:09.27]Okay.
[170:10.53]For real, though?
[170:11.81]Yeah.
[170:12.85]Where does this go?
[170:13.89]Where did that guy slide down from?
[170:15.49]Is this a sniper rifle?
[170:18.60]Yeah.
[170:18.72]We got to go.
[170:21.10]Hey, we're now in green boat room instead of red boat room.
[170:24.28]Don't you know the difference?
[170:25.76]I love how hard we are trying right now.
[170:32.67]Oh, yeah, we're trying pretty hard.
[170:34.25]We're actually trying to win.
[170:35.55]I don't know where this guy came from.
[170:37.24]Uh, I'm down.
[170:39.46]Hey, give me.
[170:40.00]What?
[170:40.50]Give me, give me, give me.
[170:42.90]Give me.
[170:43.50]Oh!
[170:57.35]Dude you don't have any idea what just happened that was not I have no idea what just happened actually I Didn't We don't have time we just gotta keep going What happened?
[171:12.57]I don't understand.
[171:13.35]There's no reason why that should have happened.
[171:15.93]I shot the guy and... Did you explode me?
[171:19.43]I exploded you, but I didn't.
[171:20.71]I didn't do that.
[171:21.61]I was not me.
[171:23.01]Trust me.
[171:23.69]I was not me.
[171:25.31]It doesn't count.
[171:25.94]That one doesn't count, does it?
[171:27.88]That's minus 10.
[171:29.37]No, but we have some points from earlier for style points.
[171:31.29]Okay, we have a lot of points because that was fucking crazy.
[171:34.30]Minus 10.
[171:34.68]That brings us to 10.
[171:37.82]And then we had... That was a bad throw.
[171:38.94]Then we had plus 5, so that brings us to 15.
[171:40.68]Wait, you're counting points?
[171:41.72]Yes.
[171:42.22]Minus 10.
[171:43.20]Plus 5.
[171:46.04]And then... And then we had a plus 2.
[171:49.81]So we are where... I'm at 16.
[171:51.59]I might need some help here.
[171:52.87]Oh, I'm coming.
[171:54.39]I'm like, I'm still alive, but it ain't pretty.
[171:59.51]Look at them.
[172:00.98]Just look at them one by one.
[172:03.68]From every position.
[172:06.82]I can't stand that.
[172:07.56]That's going to give me a fucking headache.
[172:18.03]We need an explosive to throw back there.
[172:19.49]It's over here.
[172:22.46]Okay, I'm going for the explosive.
[172:23.64]Whoa!
[172:27.52]I guess he's just being allowed to sneak over there.
[172:29.66]Okay, here we go.
[172:30.38]I'm going for it.
[172:31.05]Be covered.
[172:31.43]Cover me.
[172:32.35]I only have a shotgun.
[172:34.21]Shoot it!
[172:36.35]Got it.
[172:36.69]Didn't kill anyone.
[172:38.83]I think I got one guy.
[172:39.95]No, I got everybody.
[172:42.19]Okay, we're good here.
[172:45.60]Alright, we got a count.
[172:48.18]What was the count?
[172:49.42]So right now, I'm at 1550.
[172:54.23]15.
[172:54.31]Yeah, we got minus 10, plus 5, and then we had a plus 2 situation.
[172:57.69]We have 15 minutes to beat the whole game.
[173:03.96]I'm doing work here.
[173:04.98]I'm doing work here.
[173:05.82]That means we're going to get to... I have no ammo.
[173:09.44]We're going to get a plus 10 when we get to the end of this level.
[173:13.96]Don't worry.
[173:14.24]We have to be almost there.
[173:15.90]Do you think we're at the end of the level?
[173:17.16]We're almost there.
[173:17.64]Alright, do you want to go up?
[173:19.67]Get up there and run into the room.
[173:21.79]There's no room.
[173:24.48]Alright, you know what to do.
[173:27.35]That's not what you're supposed to be doing.
[173:29.41]You did it wrong.
[173:30.39]It's okay.
[173:30.95]I'm going to give you points for effort.
[173:33.57]Don't worry.
[173:34.19]Daddy Jeremy will do it.
[173:35.25]I think you killed anybody.
[173:36.15]You killed one person.
[173:36.85]I got three people.
[173:39.19]There were not three people there.
[173:40.49]There were three people I got.
[173:42.48]They're retreating.
[173:47.64]I've got 11 shotgun shells and that's it.
[173:52.68]Yeah, I have 96 bullets.
[173:55.70]Okay, we're good.
[173:56.34]We're good.
[173:58.58]All right.
[173:59.24]Check him.
[173:59.57]All right, easy, easy.
[174:00.23]Okay, I'm throwing this in.
[174:03.71]Do it again.
[174:04.89]What did you do?
[174:08.21]What's going on?
[174:08.73]Why are you laughing?
[174:09.31]You, on my screen, you threw it against the wall.
[174:12.27]It landed right next to you.
[174:14.07]Then you shot it and it exploded right next to you, but you're fine.
[174:18.03]On my screen, you're okay.
[174:20.33]Plus two for pride.
[174:24.23]How many waves of these guys are there?
[174:27.25]Way too many.
[174:29.99]I really want to believe this is the last level of the game.
[174:33.07]I don't think it is.
[174:33.85]For so many reasons.
[174:36.17]I kind of don't think it is either.
[174:37.25]Oh, fuck.
[174:37.92]We're in trouble.
[174:38.74]Back up, back up, back up, back up.
[174:39.86]Uh-oh.
[174:44.56]I gotta go back.
[174:45.04]I'm all the way at the beginning.
[174:47.36]Where are you?
[174:47.66]What are you doing up there?
[174:49.74]In enemy territory.
[174:50.42]What are you doing up there?
[174:51.24]There's a thousand people.
[174:52.26]There's a guy right there.
[174:54.16]Enemy territory.
[174:55.50]Yeah.
[174:55.84]Bring him out of cover.
[174:57.84]Bring him out of cover.
[174:59.85]I don't know who's shooting me now.
[175:00.79]You expect my accuracy to be able to kill these people?
[175:03.15]Yeah.
[175:04.05]Oh, yeah.
[175:04.45]You got it.
[175:06.33]Okay, I'm covering you.
[175:07.51]All right.
[175:08.19]They're okay.
[175:09.65]This is actually working.
[175:11.63]I have like eight shots.
[175:16.55]This fucking idiot is still alive.
[175:18.37]God damn it.
[175:18.95]Alright, I'm coming.
[175:20.05]I'm coming up there.
[175:21.41]Got a sniper.
[175:22.79]Any other guns up here?
[175:23.73]Okay, I got it.
[175:28.04]What's the point of having a sniper if the bullet doesn't go where you're aiming?
[175:33.32]Wait, it doesn't?
[175:34.70]Oh yeah, it does.
[175:35.48]The visual doesn't, but it actually... It's like a hit scan.
[175:41.84]Alright, I'm going down.
[175:43.16]Watch out for the fucking ketchup.
[175:44.26]There's more.
[175:44.78]There's more coming in.
[175:45.88]Oh, God.
[175:46.14]Give me the ketchup.
[175:46.58]Come on.
[175:46.78]Come on.
[175:47.04]Come on.
[175:47.38]It's important.
[175:48.70]Shoot it.
[175:49.38]That was a bad throw.
[175:50.58]Oh, that is bad.
[175:54.31]Whoa, you get points for trying, though.
[175:57.19]What is with this level?
[175:58.19]This is like the most enemies I've ever seen in one video game.
[176:02.83]Where are the grenades?
[176:04.59]Like the real grenades?
[176:05.43]I don't know.
[176:08.58]Why don't we just have an equipable grenade?
[176:11.29]Why doesn't this game's grenade throw the explosive barrel?
[176:14.53]Reuse joke minus 10.
[176:17.19]No, minus 2.
[176:17.95]No, we're not minusing anything.
[176:19.45]There was no joke there.
[176:20.21]I'm almost out of ammo.
[176:31.40]These annoying guys up top.
[176:32.60]Any dead guy.
[176:37.74]How many more are there?
[176:40.02]I'm out of bullets.
[176:40.72]I need to run over one of these guys.
[176:45.78]Any of you idiots have a gun, please?
[176:47.34]Yes.
[176:47.68]Good.
[176:49.50]I feel like I'm doing okay.
[176:53.30]We're doing fine.
[176:57.40]We're doing fine for a 2010 shooting.
[177:01.55]I can't shoot my gun.
[177:02.93]Oh.
[177:05.20]It wouldn't let me.
[177:05.90]All right.
[177:06.94]We're here.
[177:07.45]We made it.
[177:07.93]We made it to somewhere.
[177:09.81]It looks like the end of a level to me.
[177:11.21]It better be.
[177:12.29]Oh, it is.
[177:12.57]It is.
[177:12.81]Okay, plus 10.
[177:13.77]Plus 10.
[177:15.67]We're playing Time Crisis right now.
[177:18.31]Yep.
[177:23.14]Time Crisis was so expensive.
[177:25.28]Time Crisis was fun, though.
[177:27.24]It was fun.
[177:32.35]The good joke comes the good jokes are gonna have to start coming and we get down to like 60 seconds How much more this game is there hi how much more we can skip what I mean skip I Had a button push to advance that doesn't count as a cutscene No, I skipped it
[177:55.48]All right, let's go.
[177:56.50]Oh, my.
[177:56.84]This is a whole level?
[178:00.54]Apparently, we have, like, three levels left.
[178:03.92]According to people.
[178:05.24]I hope it's not just run and run.
[178:06.70]Please just don't have it be military that we shoot in random corners.
[178:11.56]How many levels have we gone through?
[178:12.86]Eight?
[178:14.96]I think it feels like eight, but I think it's more like five or six.
[178:18.14]I don't know, but we just got to go.
[178:19.98]We just got to move, and we got to play well.
[178:22.97]Don't risk any bad jokes.
[178:25.40]Not worth it.
[178:27.68]It's not worth it right now.
[178:29.58]The good joke well is starting to run dry.
[178:33.16]As is this game's inspiration.
[178:36.34]Yeah, did you hear what he said?
[178:37.64]We're too close to getting away to screw up now.
[178:39.31]I agree.
[178:41.95]Oh, look.
[178:42.95]More military to shoot.
[178:45.95]One of the same type of car.
[178:49.05]Yeah, just copy and paste it over.
[178:50.57]Thankfully, these guys are fucking idiots.
[178:56.45]No!
[178:57.96]What?
[178:58.62]What is happening?
[179:02.68]Where are you?
[179:03.52]Where are you?
[179:09.50]I'm down.
[179:14.17]You gotta be shitting me, dude.
[179:15.41]How are we doing this?
[179:16.19]I don't know.
[179:16.51]I don't understand how we're doing this.
[179:18.73]I don't know.
[179:19.05]This is getting everywhere.
[179:19.75]I'm down.
[179:20.03]I'm down.
[179:20.29]Get me.
[179:20.47]Get me.
[179:20.63]Get me.
[179:20.79]Wait.
[179:20.93]What do you mean?
[179:21.97]Get me.
[179:23.29]Got you.
[179:24.31]Okay.
[179:24.77]Where is this one guy in here?
[179:26.59]I don't know.
[179:28.75]I'm very lost and turned around right now.
[179:31.59]He's back.
[179:31.99]What are you doing back here?
[179:33.35]Why is he back here?
[179:35.25]Why?
[179:35.59]I got to stand still.
[179:39.41]Another one to your left.
[179:45.13]What?
[179:46.23]Are you okay?
[179:47.21]Yep.
[179:49.35]That guy has infinite health.
[179:51.47]But I'm otherwise okay.
[179:52.06]Is he dead?
[179:52.56]Oh, okay.
[179:53.40]Was that just bad?
[180:02.17]We deserve time for that one.
[180:03.69]We deserve time.
[180:04.53]I'm just going to go out and say it.
[180:05.48]We deserve at least plus 10 for that one.
[180:07.66]That was a plus 10 moment.
[180:09.52]It was.
[180:11.62]That was the last guy.
[180:14.54]Plus 10.
[180:15.12]That was a plus 10 moment.
[180:16.42]I'm sorry.
[180:18.46]If you disagree, you disagree.
[180:19.50]But that's plus 10.
[180:22.78]Back to 28.
[180:23.06]Back to 28.
[180:23.80]Back to 30 minutes.
[180:27.92]Alright, now where?
[180:29.56]Uh, which?
[180:30.24]Is this the way the account all came from?
[180:33.61]Machine gunner.
[180:34.35]Uh-oh, uh-oh!
[180:36.21]What?
[180:36.49]They're in there.
[180:37.19]They're all in there.
[180:38.09]Wait, we got a perfect opportunity.
[180:41.27]Machine gunner?
[180:41.91]I guess we have to kill these guys.
[180:44.44]I don't... I don't even see them.
[180:47.46]I mean, it's just like this random guy.
[180:49.54]Oh.
[180:50.40]Oh, that would... Okay, now I know why they're called machine gunners, because you almost instantly die.
[181:01.07]They've given us about 15 fuel cans.
[181:03.60]I know, for obvious reasons.
[181:05.72]How are you still alive?
[181:11.44]He's still alive, isn't he?
[181:17.68]Please.
[181:19.76]Put the mosaic on.
[181:24.64]Hey, you know when you're getting close to the end of the game?
[181:26.26]Why don't we do a warehouse?
[181:27.70]Oh!
[181:29.37]And again, is it happening again?
[181:31.97]I'm getting the propane.
[181:35.74]Help.
[181:37.06]You good?
[181:39.52]Good.
[181:44.51]Whoa, behind us, behind us, behind us, behind us, behind us.
[181:46.95]Oh, I'm in deep shit.
[181:49.07]Oh, I'm in deep shit.
[181:50.69]Wow.
[181:51.07]Hey, guess what I got?
[181:54.36]First new weapon in, like, ever.
[181:56.06]Is it a machine gun?
[181:57.14]Big one?
[181:57.64]It is a machine gun.
[181:58.68]Try and find where one of those guys died and pick it up.
[182:02.89]Probably is terribly inaccurate, but I have to assume it's good for large crowds.
[182:07.87]I don't know where the hell it is.
[182:09.17]I don't want to, like, spend wasting time.
[182:11.01]We can't waste time.
[182:15.36]I'm afraid of wasting this ammunition.
[182:16.92]Oh, I thought I just blew you into oblivion.
[182:19.14]Okay, next large group that we find is mine.
[182:22.28]Okay.
[182:29.98]They better not end the level before I get to use this.
[182:33.82]I hope they do, because then we get plus 10.
[182:35.82]I hope they do.
[182:36.80]Uh-oh.
[182:38.46]Train tracks.
[182:39.88]Almost no cover.
[182:45.97]Train tracks?
[182:46.81]We can't get minus 2 for his joke.
[182:48.73]Doesn't count.
[182:49.35]No.
[182:50.21]His comedy doesn't... I just had a freak out.
[182:56.96]Train.
[182:58.44]Here we go.
[183:02.77]Do you think that chopper saw us the second time around?
[183:05.49]Quick, just do a fart noise to get more time.
[183:08.99]Quiet.
[183:10.75]Let's actually do what we're supposed to do this time.
[183:12.29]We haven't been seen.
[183:16.33]Funny fart noise only works when MLC stops in the call.
[183:20.11]I wish this guy would stop screaming.
[183:21.39]Okay, we got explosion.
[183:26.26]That guy's alive.
[183:28.81]You wouldn't survive that.
[183:29.91]Not a chance.
[183:31.17]Not a chance in gravy.
[183:32.73]Not a chance in gravy.
[183:36.81]Are you ready for this?
[183:37.85]I'm ready.
[183:40.45]That was pretty cool.
[183:42.95]Uh-oh.
[183:43.57]Uh-oh.
[183:43.99]Oh, no.
[183:45.00]Oh, no.
[183:47.28]Alex.
[183:48.38]Alex, you seem to be missing this guy, and he's very confused about it.
[183:52.76]Oh, no.
[183:53.10]And you went through the wall.
[183:55.49]This guy is still in shock about that.
[183:58.43]Oh no, Jerma.
[184:00.83]What happened?
[184:04.48]What have you done?
[184:08.80]What happened?
[184:11.38]Did your game crash?
[184:13.38]It did.
[184:13.80]That's plus 20 minutes.
[184:15.46]It is, but we have to do that whole segment again.
[184:18.12]What?
[184:19.84]With the hundred guys that come around the corner.
[184:21.98]What?
[184:23.54]What?
[184:26.96]what what what well get it to get it to plus 20 and pause the game wait wait this is a pause situation well is it a good thing I don't think it is that's oh god I feel like we were like halfway through that level maybe like a third of the way all right what
[184:54.22]What time counter are we at?
[184:56.54]I'm still just sitting here staring at this guy holding a gun.
[184:59.20]And he's blinking.
[184:59.82]This is fucking creepy.
[185:03.61]What, uh, what is the timer?
[185:09.67]This guy... This guy knew he was on camera.
[185:17.57]Alright, that's... Okay.
[185:20.37]Hang on, are you still in the game?
[185:21.74]Yeah, I'm in your lobby now, but I'm at 44.
[185:26.29]44, and then we get a plus 2 on top of that, because that, like, guy that was playing against the T-Rex.
[185:31.59]44 plus 2.
[185:32.47]Plus 2, we're at 46.
[185:33.27]Okay.
[185:33.57]So, I'm at 4605.
[185:38.07]Oh, no, no, don't ready, don't ready.
[185:41.01]What are you talking about?
[185:42.51]Don't ready.
[185:44.43]Hold on.
[185:45.56]How do you unready?
[185:46.78]I have the starter mission selected.
[185:48.84]Hold on.
[185:49.10]Yeah, do not do that.
[185:50.49]It won't let me unready.
[185:51.43]I have to start the lobby over.
[185:53.59]Oh, you fucking bastard.
[185:54.97]It's okay.
[185:55.71]It's faster than loading the wrong level.
[185:58.97]This is true.
[185:59.51]I think.
[186:01.49]I can't be certain because it still hasn't closed out.
[186:05.63]There we go.
[186:06.47]Well, now you have to invite me again.
[186:09.74]I need an invite.
[186:13.00]Hey, look at that.
[186:14.44]Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[186:19.09]We're on the eighth mission currently.
[186:21.21]I guess there's like two or three more after the one we're on right now.
[186:25.94]Hey, at least we have time.
[186:28.44]Two or three more.
[186:29.94]There's only two or three more and I'm like getting hungry.
[186:32.26]I need a snack.
[186:34.71]All right.
[186:35.79]Are you coming?
[186:37.83]There I am.
[186:38.35]Okay.
[186:38.91]Pick the right one.
[186:39.57]Out of Shanghai.
[186:40.19]It's the right one.
[186:41.10]Yep.
[186:41.90]I'm readied up.
[186:43.16]Ready up.
[186:44.34]And are you ready to start the timer again?
[186:48.28]Yep.
[186:48.42]4605.
[186:48.46]You ready?
[186:48.72]I am ready.
[186:49.28]Three, two, one, start it.
[186:51.64]Let's go.
[187:01.05]I love how we started that when it was buffering.
[187:02.53]That sounds like a mistake.
[187:08.62]That one segment that we got lucky on, we're gonna have to do for real this time.
[187:14.10]You guys didn't just hear that, don't worry.
[187:15.74]We didn't have like a Mountain Dew ad.
[187:17.36]Wait, what?
[187:19.64]It was just a fucking Mountain Dew ad.
[187:20.94]Alright, we can skip this.
[187:23.12]It says, waiting for players.
[187:24.94]All players left the game.
[187:28.31]Says you left the game.
[187:29.21]What?
[187:30.41]Yep.
[187:32.83]Pause.
[187:34.19]What do you mean I left the game?
[187:35.89]Says you left the game.
[187:37.91]Alt tab while buffering.
[187:38.95]Oh my god.
[187:39.79]Left the game.
[187:40.43]Alright, pause.
[187:41.55]4605.
[187:42.29]We're losing the stream challenge right now.
[187:46.52]We're losing the challenge.
[187:49.38]Oh, fuck me. 4605.
[187:55.27]All right.
[187:55.91]Back to 4605.
[187:57.27]Let's do it inside of... Oh, god damn it.
[188:04.07]Game didn't crash, though.
[188:05.02]It was just a bad connection.
[188:08.64]Plus 20 minutes.
[188:09.86]No, not plus 20 minutes for like a random DC.
[188:14.14]So we're going to start the timer at 4605 when we're in the game.
[188:17.82]Like before we load or after we load?
[188:19.86]Like after we load into the game.
[188:21.50]Okay.
[188:22.10]So we're going to start it.
[188:23.10]Ready?
[188:23.60]Yeah, I'm ready.
[188:27.40]Can't do this right.
[188:29.44]Answer your phone.
[188:33.09]Okay.
[188:33.89]Come on.
[188:35.97]Uh, hello?
[188:40.31]Game didn't crash.
[188:41.01]It just stopped working in a crashing manner.
[188:44.95]But it didn't crash.
[188:47.31]Hard crashing out of a game takes way longer to get back in.
[188:57.41]All right.
[188:59.77]Stuck at 99%.
[189:02.78]Watch us not be able to get back into the game.
[189:05.86]I would laugh.
[189:09.12]Okay.
[189:09.58]We good?
[189:10.18]We're here.
[189:11.26]So.
[189:12.54]I got bad news.
[189:13.22]What do you mean you have bad news?
[189:15.00]Actually, we might have good news.
[189:16.84]We might get another 20 minutes.
[189:18.58]Did you crash?
[189:19.84]No.
[189:20.63]It's actually worse than crashing.
[189:21.85]Can you see me in the game?
[189:22.83]Yeah.
[189:23.73]Am I moving?
[189:24.17]Yeah.
[189:25.75]Oh, because my screen is entirely gray.
[189:27.79]What do you mean gray?
[189:30.83]My whole game is gray.
[189:32.05]I can see I have 120 bullets.
[189:34.35]I can see the subtitle.
[189:35.45]Let me try.
[189:36.69]What did you like?
[189:37.13]I'm tapping and tabbing back in.
[189:41.65]Your game is gray.
[189:43.61]I can see my crosshair.
[189:46.35]It's you?
[189:46.77]Am I looking at you right now?
[189:47.89]You're looking at me.
[189:48.49]Okay, because my crosshair is turning green.
[189:51.36]I am playing as Blind Man Kane.
[189:55.12]I can't see a single thing.
[189:56.82]All right, well...
[190:00.20]Are we starting the timer and going, or are we restarting?
[190:03.20]We cannot start the timer like this.
[190:04.80]All right, so just remake.
[190:07.51]I think I need to close the whole game.
[190:09.55]All right, this counts as a crash.
[190:10.75]That's kind of a crash.
[190:11.51]This counts as a crash.
[190:12.27]This is at least a half-hour crash.
[190:14.25]At least like a 10-minute crash.
[190:16.21]This is bang-bang.
[190:17.90]This is 20 minutes.
[190:19.40]Hour and six.
[190:19.90]This is bang-bang.
[190:22.22]Yep.
[190:22.62]It's the same deal.
[190:23.90]We're at one hour and six.
[190:27.42]Just restart.
[190:30.60]okay restarting the game we went from like 19 minutes to like an hour all right loading back in hey we said a crash was 20 minutes yeah we did say that and that was technically a crash like we loaded in and it didn't work
[190:54.21]pretty much watch it keep crashing over and over again we get back up to like five hours that's a lot of profit in time it can be very easily lost in deaths though invite to game select the correct level all right hold on this is gonna fucking freak out okay it was unplayable so that's the same thing as a crash all right
[191:22.13]Let's meet in the middle.
[191:24.05]Five minutes.
[191:25.29]That's not the middle.
[191:26.17]Ten minutes is the middle.
[191:27.23]Let's meet in the middle.
[191:28.11]Five minutes.
[191:29.31]We're getting a lot of flack for this one.
[191:31.21]All right.
[191:31.42]We're getting a lot of flack.
[191:32.10]It wants me to host a match.
[191:33.64]Okay.
[191:33.94]Minus ten.
[191:35.64]Minus five.
[191:36.62]I can't.
[191:38.82]Just do minus fifteen.
[191:40.08]What's the total time we're at right now?
[191:41.82]We're at 106.05.
[191:42.58]Minus fifteen.
[191:44.35]So, 51.
[191:45.07]So, yeah.
[191:45.59]51.05.
[191:46.23]No, wait.
[191:46.53]What?
[191:46.65]What?
[191:50.39]No, 5505.
[191:51.25]We lost 15 minutes.
[191:55.52]Okay, listen, we added, we were at 106 minus 15 is 51.
[192:01.76]What the fuck are you talking about?
[192:10.37]What time is it?
[192:11.47]No, no, okay, yeah, yeah, 5105.
[192:13.47]You got it, yeah, all right.
[192:15.41]All right, I'm ready.
[192:16.80]Can you invite me again?
[192:20.47]Uh, yeah.
[192:29.32]Starting.
[192:29.96]Look, it's a lot of shit to keep track of, alright?
[192:31.88]I know, it is.
[192:32.96]We're like plus one, minus one, plus ten, minus five, minus fifteen.
[192:37.58]We got an alt tab and close out of the game.
[192:39.74]We got like crashes and shit.
[192:41.63]Okay, I'm gonna ready up now.
[192:42.89]We're on the correct level.
[192:46.89]Stop with the Steam notification?
[192:48.29]I need to know if I'm being notified.
[192:51.56]Alright, wait till we get in.
[192:52.66]Hopefully your game's not gray.
[192:53.88]If it is, then you're gonna have to deal with it.
[193:00.58]My game goes gray.
[193:01.78]Sorry, this went to shit.
[193:03.31]Wait, what?
[193:03.85]Am I muted?
[193:04.93]No.
[193:05.07]I hope not.
[193:05.75]Make Jerma add a minute.
[193:19.97]Oh, I don't want to get out.
[193:21.35]If I alt-tab right now, I'm going to fuck up the whole thing.
[193:23.75]What am I going to eat today?
[193:29.75]Oh, it's like midnight.
[193:30.61]Never mind.
[193:31.47]I'm not going to be eating anything.
[193:35.08]I can see.
[193:35.72]You can see.
[193:36.26]Okay, good.
[193:36.76]Because I'm going to... 51.
[193:39.90]I am ready.
[193:40.40]Are you ready?
[193:40.88]5105.
[193:40.90]5105.
[193:40.92]3, 2, 1, bang.
[193:41.28]Go.
[193:41.38]Alright, bang it out.
[193:48.25]Alright, we're good.
[193:48.73]We're going to be clean with this one.
[193:51.33]I love how we are just doing the level again, pretty much, and we gained like 42 minutes.
[193:56.61]That's just fucking fantastic.
[193:58.69]No, no, no.
[193:59.27]We didn't gain 42.
[193:59.91]We only gained 25, right?
[194:02.65]Whatever it is.
[194:03.44]It's the game's fault it crashed too many times.
[194:06.16]We only got five minutes for the last crash.
[194:09.60]Yeah, that's true.
[194:10.18]Because your chat wants to skimp on time.
[194:12.68]Money owed.
[194:13.68]Pay it up.
[194:15.12]Money owed.
[194:18.58]All right.
[194:20.18]Here it comes.
[194:20.68]It's coming up.
[194:21.26]This is the turn.
[194:21.98]Like, when you turn this corner.
[194:23.70]No, it's not.
[194:24.32]It's the next one.
[194:25.73]It's like when you go outside of one of these things.
[194:27.73]There's a lot of fucking... It's this one.
[194:29.21]No, it's not.
[194:29.67]There's a lot of dumb shit here.
[194:31.29]It's this one.
[194:32.13]No, it's not.
[194:34.13]No, it is this one.
[194:34.81]You're right.
[194:35.33]It is this one.
[194:36.68]You know what?
[194:37.04]We got to be pro...
[194:41.99]Oh my fucking god.
[194:42.99]I swear to god.
[194:45.29]I'm trying to rush this because I don't want to fucking do it again.
[194:49.31]You did it.
[194:52.04]We just lost 10 minutes.
[194:53.34]God.
[194:53.52]We're down to 39.58 now.
[194:54.74]I don't like.
[194:55.36]I just want to.
[194:56.06]I'm trying to rush it.
[194:57.26]We just lost 10 minutes.
[194:59.72]I just didn't want to do this whole thing again.
[195:01.36]I just wanted to go fast.
[195:02.60]Now look at us.
[195:04.99]Okay, let's go.
[195:05.81]Yeah, because we accidentally did it fast the first time.
[195:08.61]But somehow, this time around, we have to do the actual fight.
[195:13.19]Oh, this sucks.
[195:16.33]Fucking beat the game challenge.
[195:19.47]More like delete the game challenge.
[195:22.57]As soon as possible.
[195:23.86]And we can't even steam refund this.
[195:25.40]Uh-oh.
[195:27.54]What do you mean, uh-oh?
[195:28.62]I'm fine.
[195:29.52]Don't mind me.
[195:30.24]They're to the left, too.
[195:31.10]They're flanking left.
[195:32.39]No, I know.
[195:32.83]Where are you doing?
[195:34.05]No, to your left.
[195:35.49]Where are you behind me?
[195:36.83]To your left.
[195:43.77]They're flanking through that door.
[195:45.13]2010 AI.
[195:46.61]It's like too smart for us.
[195:51.27]Now they're behind us?
[195:52.07]I don't know where they... How are you here?
[195:54.43]I don't understand how that guy got there.
[195:57.67]I don't know either.
[196:00.77]Plus two for delete the game challenge.
[196:05.77]Oh, that could have gone badly.
[196:09.23]Let me get behind one of the fucking many unpainted cars.
[196:14.82]Don't you like white cars because they don't get as dirty?
[196:19.76]You don't have to give them baths as much?
[196:21.76]White cars get way more dirty.
[196:23.02]What are you talking about?
[196:24.69]No, dark colored cars.
[196:26.61]You have to clean more.
[196:29.01]You can see dust on the board.
[196:30.11]See this guy slowly getting up?
[196:35.05]What on earth were we just watching?
[196:36.91]I don't know.
[196:38.57]All right, let's... Do you hear the horror movie music in the background?
[196:43.88]Yeah, but here's the corner, dude.
[196:45.12]We've got to be prepared for this.
[196:46.10]This is the corner that it's like insanity.
[196:48.70]I thought those were the people.
[196:51.66]Nope, it's not.
[196:52.62]Here they come.
[196:53.76]Wait, what?
[196:54.34]Why were there so many last time?
[196:55.48]Okay, okay.
[196:58.13]Do you... See, I'm looking at a rat.
[197:00.64]Nice.
[197:03.74]Rats in this game?
[197:04.76]Nice.
[197:11.30]Dude.
[197:14.46]So, have we figured out what that thing at the top actually means?
[197:18.46]It's counting... I don't get it.
[197:23.72]Where are you?
[197:25.14]Behind me?
[197:25.72]Alright, let's go.
[197:26.58]Literally right behind you.
[197:27.83]This is the machine gunner room.
[197:31.23]I think people come from over... Which way do they come from?
[197:33.39]Left.
[197:35.39]But the machine gunners are here.
[197:38.01]And... Don't die.
[197:42.96]Really?
[197:43.26]Come on.
[197:43.52]Do you have a sniper?
[197:48.28]Because I do not.
[197:50.12]I mean, I have a gun that'll kill them, but I have to...
[197:53.39]Alright, one's dead.
[197:54.01]There's still one alive right there.
[198:01.42]I hate how they just keep going to the... You know what?
[198:06.70]I hate how they go to the same spots.
[198:08.86]Alright, but both... Yeah, they all go to that same left spot.
[198:12.91]They go to the same spot, and, like, you think you killed a guy, and then another guy, a different guy, is in the same place.
[198:18.25]It's like the guy respawned, and they're the same exact people, too.
[198:23.94]You don't like that everyone is the same military man?
[198:27.40]No.
[198:27.72]At least give me some browns.
[198:28.94]Give me some greens.
[198:30.62]Give me some, like, oranges.
[198:31.79]Give me a guy that's just, like, bright fucking red, like we were.
[198:40.69]Um.
[198:42.95]Okay.
[198:44.09]I'll take it.
[198:44.71]So nice, he died twice.
[198:46.83]Hang on, I want my machine gun to crash my game.
[198:49.56]Maybe you shouldn't pick up this machine gun.
[198:51.76]No, it's really cool.
[198:54.36]Go get the other guys.
[198:55.08]Uh, where did the other guy die?
[198:57.18]It's, like, really cool, man.
[198:58.38]Alright, we gotta add two minutes.
[198:59.32]Where did the guy die?
[199:01.11]I'm adding two.
[199:01.77]Back here?
[199:03.19]From, like, a couple minutes ago.
[199:04.67]You're adding two?
[199:05.85]Yeah, remember, you had, like, a delete the game joke.
[199:09.77]Oh, that's right.
[199:10.27]That was a really funny delete the game joke.
[199:12.03]Alright, I'm up plus two.
[199:14.31]That was plus two, for sure.
[199:15.51]Yep.
[199:19.67]Alright, hopefully we don't have... I don't really want to use game crash gun for that long.
[199:24.84]I'm going to use it even if it crashes the game.
[199:27.38]Oh, God.
[199:28.48]Because we get more time.
[199:29.96]Yeah, but then we have to do it again.
[199:32.32]It's just Groundhog Day.
[199:35.22]Fine.
[199:36.04]I'll try not to use it, but it's the only fun gun I found in like two hours.
[199:40.52]You fired that gun and the whole game turned off.
[199:42.48]Alright, let's just test... No, we're not going to do it.
[199:46.03]I'm going to do it, but not right now.
[199:47.39]Alright, let's go.
[199:49.80]chopper oh did you see us why can't we like load from checkpoint I wish there like is no there's no there are no checkpoint no there's not this is where we were okay this is where we crashed where we crashed it really didn't take that long to get back here to be fair I can't get off the door there we go
[200:19.87]Why did the boxcar just explode?
[200:23.25]Ah, that was me.
[200:24.67]I got that guy right in his tootsie.
[200:26.29]You should have the opportunity.
[200:35.13]All clear.
[200:36.59]All clear.
[200:37.27]Yep.
[200:38.87]Keep it up.
[200:39.39]Don't shoot any explosives.
[200:40.97]We can make it through this.
[200:41.87]We can make it through.
[200:42.99]We can do this.
[200:44.27]I think we were at the end of the level, too.
[200:45.47]That's the worst part about this whole thing.
[200:47.46]Oh, shit.
[200:49.12]Are you kidding?
[200:49.66]That's where we crashed, was in that room.
[200:51.70]I'm just saying, I think we're at the end of the level up here, I think.
[200:54.74]The level was like, we've been here for five minutes.
[200:56.96]There's no way this is the end of the level.
[200:59.47]Let me have my fucking fantasy, please.
[201:01.07]Let me have my just messed up fantasy.
[201:03.79]I don't want you to mislead everyone.
[201:06.43]Like all these people that just came in here who are hoping that the level is almost over.
[201:10.35]It's not.
[201:12.23]But it could be.
[201:15.92]This has gone on for far too long.
[201:18.14]That's the challenge.
[201:19.38]But we have to beat the game.
[201:20.94]Yeah, it's the 2010 co-op beat the game in one stream challenge.
[201:23.66]Where?
[201:24.20]I'm still alive.
[201:26.06]Good.
[201:27.00]I thought you were down.
[201:27.88]There's a... The guy shouldn't have been there.
[201:31.34]Shouldn't have been there.
[201:33.42]Where's this other guy?
[201:34.22]He's still here.
[201:37.22]What?
[201:37.80]Help!
[201:37.94]Give me up!
[201:38.56]Wait!
[201:38.92]No way!
[201:39.48]No way!
[201:39.78]I almost just lost!
[201:40.64]Give me up!
[201:41.30]Oh my god!
[201:42.48]I almost fucking killed this bull.
[201:43.86]I almost just started crying.
[201:46.89]There's more!
[201:47.63]I'm going back to safety.
[201:48.49]I'm going back to where we started.
[201:49.47]Yeah.
[201:53.95]You know what?
[201:54.91]We lose points for death.
[201:56.39]Why don't we get points for a successful revive?
[201:59.04]Because it's too many alt tabs.
[202:00.48]We've fallen down like a thousand times.
[202:02.76]It's true.
[202:03.24]We could exploit the system, I guess, but...
[202:05.87]Kind of a risky play.
[202:06.73]We've got to go this way.
[202:07.93]There's a guy up there, and he auto-locked onto him.
[202:10.61]He's got one of those bad guns.
[202:12.91]He's got one of the long ones.
[202:14.47]A sniper rifle.
[202:15.43]Jesus.
[202:18.61]He's dead.
[202:19.28]Nice.
[202:19.74]Good ragdoll.
[202:26.06]Come on.
[202:26.68]Come on.
[202:27.42]Help me.
[202:27.70]I tell you to help me now.
[202:28.68]All right.
[202:29.80]I'm going to use the crash gun.
[202:32.23]We've got to use the crash gun.
[202:33.49]No!
[202:33.69]No!
[202:39.35]I really thought the game crashed.
[202:47.01]I gotta reload.
[202:49.07]Reload the crash gun.
[202:49.81]I really thought the game crashed when you shot it.
[202:54.38]Blew that guy's clothes off.
[202:57.36]Okay, crash gun saved us.
[202:58.70]It worked.
[202:59.22]This is getting difficult and scary because I don't want to lose any more time.
[203:02.90]Yeah, it became a horror game at some point.
[203:07.54]People are waiting around every corner for us.
[203:10.95]Keep going.
[203:11.97]They're going to pop out.
[203:14.53]Just fall back.
[203:15.11]Every time we aggro enemies, fall back.
[203:18.03]Fall back.
[203:18.37]Is that you making that noise?
[203:26.53]Yeah.
[203:28.25]Did you shoot that?
[203:29.23]Yes.
[203:30.89]Okay.
[203:31.09]All right, move up a little.
[203:37.44]Oh, God.
[203:40.98]I'm moving up.
[203:42.38]Oh, bad idea.
[203:43.30]I'm sorry.
[203:43.64]Oh, get me up.
[203:45.38]Come on.
[203:46.00]Stop giving me so much.
[203:47.32]You're giving me heartburn.
[203:51.09]I made sure to do it really close to you.
[203:52.87]Oh, you're giving me heartburn.
[203:53.79]I need to get up.
[203:54.41]Help me.
[203:54.77]Help me.
[203:55.19]Help me.
[203:55.57]Heartburn.
[203:56.03]You're good.
[203:58.25]You're good.
[203:59.17]I'm going to the boxcar.
[204:00.79]There's no good angle here.
[204:02.87]No, there's not.
[204:07.68]Is that it?
[204:08.58]Can we finally move?
[204:13.42]Plus two for heartburn?
[204:15.38]Alright, I'm getting a plus two for heartburn here.
[204:19.50]I just added plus two.
[204:21.38]Plus two.
[204:24.48]Why do none of the enemies talk?
[204:25.54]That's a good point.
[204:28.76]Why do none of the enemies talk?
[204:30.30]Yeah, they're just kind of walking forward and dying.
[204:33.51]Um...
[204:37.59]Alright, stealth portion.
[204:38.51]I think we're at a stealth portion.
[204:44.21]Great stealth portion of the game.
[204:46.41]Walk out and instantly get fired at by a guy with a machine gun.
[204:51.68]Move quietly.
[204:52.26]That guy on top of the train car is waiting for you to come out.
[204:55.28]That guy was aimed at the... Well, that's a machine gun guy.
[205:00.26]Thank God he just got instantly killed.
[205:05.01]Alright, crash gun?
[205:06.67]I'm gonna go for it.
[205:07.27]I'm gonna get the crash gun.
[205:10.56]This is it right here, okay.
[205:12.08]I got the crash gun.
[205:13.20]Got the crash gun.
[205:14.46]I still got the crash gun too.
[205:15.48]I'm so scared.
[205:16.46]I'm so scared to do that though.
[205:17.48]You don't think it's a bad idea to do double crash gun?
[205:19.34]I don't know.
[205:20.62]I went through it okay.
[205:21.62]You know, I did okay.
[205:22.30]Okay.
[205:22.58]We made it through.
[205:23.02]Well, this looks like a bunch of enemies are gonna come out.
[205:25.38]There's a bunch of enemies, yes.
[205:28.40]Okay, you ready?
[205:28.83]Double crash gun?
[205:30.62]We're going to do a countdown here.
[205:31.68]No, no, no.
[205:31.88]Because if we both go down at the same time.
[205:34.38]Here, I'm going to run around this way.
[205:35.66]Okay.
[205:38.84]Not yet.
[205:39.82]We've got to have a better angle here.
[205:42.04]We've got to get on this train.
[205:42.78]But, dude, I think we're going to fail the mission.
[205:45.95]Okay.
[205:46.73]Crash gun.
[205:47.27]Go.
[205:47.81]Crash gun and go.
[205:54.25]How do you get over there?
[205:55.31]We did it.
[205:55.73]Okay.
[205:57.17]That's plus 10.
[205:57.57]Okay.
[206:00.42]Oh my goodness, that was a little too much.
[206:03.28]Don't all tap yet.
[206:04.08]I feel stressed out in real life.
[206:06.12]Yeah, don't all tap yet because I don't want to lose this.
[206:11.03]Oh no.
[206:14.27]They don't have weapons.
[206:15.19]They just... Oh.
[206:18.35]I hope we're not naked again.
[206:23.39]If we appear naked again... Does that count?
[206:26.55]We're going to lose by default.
[206:27.96]Does that count as- that counts as- as nudity we've already seen and then we'd had some time deducted?
[206:31.65]If it's us, yeah.
[206:32.59]If it's our bodies, we've already seen them.
[206:34.45]Okay.
[206:36.37]So that would be just double jeopardy.
[206:38.26]You can't be found guilty of the same crime twice.
[206:40.92]Didn't this just happen to us like over the- I feel like I'm like a deja vu.
[206:44.50]We've gotten captured once already, yes, by these same people.
[206:54.87]Alright, I'm gonna... I'm gonna alt-tab here.
[206:57.37]And plus 10.
[206:57.96]In the cutscene?
[206:58.86]Plus 10.
[207:00.10]Plus 10?
[207:00.94]We're good.
[207:02.02]We got 41 minutes.
[207:02.62]Okay, we beat the level?
[207:06.18]So, if everyone's correct, we should be, like, on the last or second-to-last level.
[207:11.02]There that guy goes.
[207:12.42]Okay.
[207:14.70]What?
[207:15.08]That was such a Wilhelm scream, by the way.
[207:16.45]I just had a Wilhelm scream?
[207:18.45]Oh.
[207:19.53]Okay, I think this is where...
[207:22.61]We both have game crashing guns.
[207:24.56]Okay, we both have crash game guns.
[207:25.76]Nobody is flying that helicopter, by the way.
[207:31.76]Uh, yep.
[207:35.70]We should get plus two for Wilhelm.
[207:39.66]Just for it being in the game.
[207:41.18]Plus two for Wilhelm.
[207:49.49]I thought for a second I just jumped out.
[207:52.68]I'm actually surprised we haven't had to just... This is loud.
[207:56.34]This is so loud.
[207:56.78]And there's a lot of civilians that are dying too.
[207:58.40]There's a lot of civilians that are dying too.
[208:01.58]We have to get a tally after this.
[208:02.76]I don't know.
[208:04.10]How many?
[208:04.46]I think there was at least four civilians.
[208:05.44]There was at least four civilians.
[208:06.54]And five, maybe.
[208:07.58]That's minus five.
[208:10.42]But we get plus two for Wilhelm, so it's minus three.
[208:12.86]So minus three is the net.
[208:13.68]One, two, three.
[208:14.18]One, two, three.
[208:15.66]Okay, get back in.
[208:16.36]We got more people to kill.
[208:17.08]We got more people to kill.
[208:20.52]Watch out.
[208:21.54]Careful.
[208:22.52]There's no civilians here.
[208:25.33]You get to shoot everyone before me, and it's so loud!
[208:28.85]I have to turn the volume down.
[208:30.27]This is unbearable.
[208:31.93]I've killed at least two civilians.
[208:33.67]This volume is so loud.
[208:36.97]There.
[208:38.87]We're at least minus two, keep a tally.
[208:40.79]Wait, you just killed two more?
[208:43.68]Yeah, minus three.
[208:45.90]Three?
[208:46.36]Dude, they're just getting in the way.
[208:48.36]It's not possible to stop it.
[208:51.80]Okay, is the volume better now?
[208:54.16]Should be a little better.
[208:55.28]Loud volume.
[208:57.48]It was so loud.
[208:58.58]Okay, we got audio effects.
[209:03.52]That should be better.
[209:04.84]At least temporarily.
[209:05.62]Alright, so we got a minus three situation here, Talix.
[209:07.95]Minus three.
[209:12.03]One, two, three.
[209:13.87]We're losing too much time, and I'm not even getting to play the Unreal section.
[209:17.79]Alright, then you do it.
[209:22.80]Okay, we have to do a... What do you mean dying?
[209:26.49]Like, he's actually hitting me.
[209:28.11]Oh, you can change cover.
[209:29.01]You can change cover?
[209:31.23]Oh, you can.
[209:32.43]We need to do the house of the dead boss.
[209:35.90]Not that easy.
[209:37.12]Not that pretty.
[209:38.76]Not that easy?
[209:39.66]I'm just holding down the left mouse button.
[209:43.98]Make some jokes.
[209:44.74]I mean, it's hard right now.
[209:46.77]We're a little constricted.
[209:48.07]We're kind of constricted.
[209:51.09]The stream ends at zero.
[209:52.39]That's correct.
[209:52.87]Alright, we're good.
[209:57.53]I didn't even get to see him explode.
[210:01.31]He just died off stream.
[210:07.08]This guy seems to be on our side now for some reason.
[210:08.98]Don't ask me why.
[210:09.54]Yeah, I'm confused why the pilot is on our side.
[210:14.24]Chopper gunner.
[210:14.78]He's very clearly helping us.
[210:21.09]How many more?
[210:21.49]There's another one.
[210:22.97]Just get rid of the guy with the RPG.
[210:24.89]Don't let the guy shoot the helicopter.
[210:32.87]I'm going to cry if we get killed by a rocket launcher.
[210:36.39]Oh, because we have to do the whole segment over again, you mean?
[210:38.53]Yeah.
[210:39.59]Go, go, go.
[210:40.21]I feel like you're the only person who can see those people.
[210:49.19]I'm reloading.
[210:50.47]No, that guy.
[210:52.64]Anymore?
[210:52.96]Well, thankfully this section is very easy.
[210:59.98]So this whole level is easy.
[211:01.20]I'm surprised this whole game wasn't on rails.
[211:03.16]In fact, it was.
[211:03.70]It was an illusion.
[211:04.40]Eh.
[211:04.48]Eh.
[211:04.72]Holy shit, he hurts.
[211:22.82]discussion that hurts a lot actually I'm like in trouble why are we just oh me too I don't want to die don't die he's dead got him this piece of junk is burning up we're gonna crash land hopefully this is the end of this level so uh from what I understand there are two levels left but they're both two-parters
[211:52.70]Okay.
[211:53.68]So maybe there's effectively four levels left?
[211:57.58]Thankfully we just got a plus ten.
[211:59.46]We just got a plus ten.
[212:02.99]We did just get a plus ten.
[212:06.99]Okay.
[212:07.99]Plus ten.
[212:08.83]In the middle of buffer because I'm a brave man.
[212:11.11]That's very brave of you.
[212:16.73]Scripted helicopter crash minus ten.
[212:18.90]Okay.
[212:26.31]They made a net profit even with all the civilians.
[212:31.51]Oh yeah, what was this final civilian count?
[212:34.31]Well, there was a minus three.
[212:36.49]What tally are you at right now?
[212:39.11]Well, we killed, it was five, six, seven, eight.
[212:41.47]Eight civilians died.
[212:43.53]So I already did my, I think I already did my civilians, didn't I?
[212:46.96]Oh.
[212:47.88]I'm talking about this very nonchalantly, by the way.
[212:51.30]I already did it when I killed the civilians, right guys?
[212:53.90]I already deduced points for that one?
[212:57.08]For murdering all those innocents?
[212:59.66]So what's your time?
[213:00.36]Like, what time are you at?
[213:01.85]I am at... I'm at 40.
[213:04.11]I'm at 29.
[213:05.41]Oh.
[213:05.63]But I'm now at 39.
[213:08.65]Oh.
[213:09.31]Because I didn't add the plus 10.
[213:11.91]Okay.
[213:13.39]39.
[213:17.60]Okay.
[213:20.32]One more helicopter, maybe.
[213:22.52]Maybe.
[213:23.60]No guns.
[213:24.04]No weapons.
[213:24.54]No guns.
[213:29.00]Guess we're on the helipad I Look at that draw distance pretty cool Wow Where are we what city is this?
[213:40.72]We are aren't we in Shanghai?
[213:42.78]It took me this long to figure that out.
[213:44.62]Yeah, haven't we been in China for the entirety of the game?
[213:47.67]Shanghai but maybe like this guy here just
[213:57.09]Look at those guys.
[213:57.76]Look at the guys.
[213:58.40]Where?
[213:59.50]Look at all of them.
[214:00.16]They don't know we're here.
[214:00.82]They don't know we're here.
[214:01.40]Good.
[214:01.80]Don't even risk it.
[214:02.30]Look at the ones with their backs to the wall like we're over there.
[214:05.42]Don't risk it.
[214:05.94]Let's just keep going.
[214:07.54]Keep going?
[214:08.08]Yeah, keep going.
[214:08.54]Don't risk it.
[214:09.62]Oh, like just run to the door?
[214:10.79]Just run to the door.
[214:11.67]Run to where we need to go.
[214:12.37]You know what I mean?
[214:13.15]We're going to run to the door.
[214:14.03]Let's get out of here.
[214:15.15]Straight ahead.
[214:19.09]No sense like crying over spilt bread.
[214:20.73]Quick, they know we're here.
[214:25.04]Are you still dying?
[214:25.87]Because you're getting shot.
[214:27.27]No, I'm okay.
[214:27.79]Hey, we made it.
[214:28.83]Look, they're still there.
[214:30.21]Oh, they're still... Hey!
[214:32.41]You can't do that.
[214:35.27]You can't do that through the wall.
[214:37.13]I got to turn the game back up.
[214:38.15]I can't hear it anymore.
[214:38.93]Yeah, I got to turn the game up too.
[214:40.22]One more.
[214:47.22]All right, we're back in business.
[214:51.48]Magic bullets.
[214:53.88]Oh!
[214:55.48]I'm down.
[214:55.72]That's not you?
[214:56.52]Oh.
[214:56.64]You have to pick me up.
[214:57.46]You have to pick me up.
[214:59.16]Did I get it?
[215:02.61]That's not fair.
[215:04.37]Well, it's not fair, but that's minus five.
[215:08.37]That's not fair.
[215:09.03]That's not fair, but, like, life isn't fair.
[215:13.56]Minus five.
[215:15.26]Guard!
[215:15.40]Straight!
[215:17.75]He came up the stairs.
[215:19.57]How did he know we were there?
[215:20.63]I don't know.
[215:22.43]We didn't shoot anything.
[215:26.61]There's so many people down here.
[215:29.45]Can't see.
[215:32.89]Just pick them off like ducks.
[215:36.37]What?
[215:37.46]Pick them off like ducks.
[215:41.02]Like ducks.
[215:41.86]Like the animal.
[215:42.60]The duck.
[215:43.44]When a duck flies by.
[215:44.54]And you get him.
[215:47.95]Is that a common phrase?
[215:50.19]Yeah.
[215:52.99]Did you just go, yeah, at me?
[215:54.87]Yeah.
[215:58.98]Game crashed.
[215:59.48]Uh-oh.
[216:00.38]No, no, no.
[216:00.80]No, it didn't.
[216:01.38]No, it didn't.
[216:02.20]Right?
[216:02.84]No, it didn't, right?
[216:05.16]No, it didn't, right?
[216:05.96]Game crashed.
[216:06.86]No.
[216:07.30]Yeah?
[216:07.56]No.
[216:07.90]Hang on, hang on.
[216:08.28]Okay, this is what you're gonna do.
[216:09.24]Close the game as fast as you can.
[216:10.40]What?
[216:10.54]Okay, closing is fine.
[216:11.04]Reopen it and join on me.
[216:12.04]Going.
[216:12.94]Close it as fast as you can.
[216:14.35]Open it and join on me.
[216:15.37]And see if you get back in before my game crashes.
[216:17.47]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[216:18.21]Go, go, go, go, go.
[216:20.51]Because your character is still here.
[216:22.07]Go, go, go, go, go.
[216:23.03]I'm going to join off you.
[216:25.17]I'm still here.
[216:25.71]Join off me.
[216:26.17]Just right-click my Steam name.
[216:27.49]Join me.
[216:27.87]By the way, that's a plus 20.
[216:29.41]All players left the game.
[216:30.72]No!
[216:31.28]Shit in my... Fuck.
[216:32.10]Fuck.
[216:35.51]That was the real race.
[216:37.47]Back to 51.
[216:37.91]You know what we're going to have to do again, right?
[216:39.93]What?
[216:40.91]Do we have to do the helicopter again?
[216:42.23]No, no, no, no, no way.
[216:43.51]We got an achievement for that shit.
[216:45.35]Okay, so we should just theoretically have to run up the helipad and into the room we crashed in.
[216:51.89]I think.
[216:52.29]Theoretically, hopefully.
[216:54.25]Okay, so that's plus 20.
[216:56.45]Shit in my fuck, what an evolutionary commentary.
[217:00.71]I know, right?
[217:01.27]Plus 20 minutes for the crash, so we're at 50.
[217:04.84]yeah yeah at this at this moment we are at all right what are you at 50 what 50 minutes 32 seconds that's yeah close enough you're just still counting down right yeah okay whatever let's just go we're good all right I sent you an invite and let's see what mission it is resurrection okay all right let's go
[217:32.39]This stream has already lasted way longer than I thought it would.
[217:35.84]I know.
[217:37.10]That's not me.
[217:37.86]Someone else.
[217:39.36]People had low expectations about our persistence, I think?
[217:43.60]Durability?
[217:44.32]You guys didn't think we were actually going to try to beat this?
[217:47.58]Forget about the game crashes.
[217:48.63]I mean, we actually probably would have lost the challenge.
[217:51.83]If the game didn't crash four times, we would have lost the challenge an hour ago.
[217:56.49]I think it has crashed, what, three times now?
[217:59.13]It's a full hour.
[218:00.33]We've gained a full hour because of game crashes.
[218:02.07]But we've lost a full hour for nudity.
[218:05.03]You know, that is true.
[218:07.97]We did lose an entire hour from nudity.
[218:11.62]That's true.
[218:16.20]I would love it if this would go, you know.
[218:19.72]Great.
[218:21.89]This is before they learned you could disguise loading screens with mocap cutscenes.
[218:27.88]So we just have to watch the spinny loading bar.
[218:31.87]Seriously, I know.
[218:33.99]I think we're going to be able to beat this within the four hours that we initially lost.
[218:38.48]We have, uh, 25-30 minutes, technically.
[218:42.94]We have 20 minutes, technically, for, like, an... Yeah.
[218:46.22]Here's the stupidest part about this joke that we've been doing.
[218:48.85]Skip.
[218:49.73]It's gonna turn out to be completely even.
[218:51.17]We just needed a timer on the whole time.
[218:53.57]Think about that.
[218:54.09]Yeah, we needed a timer that counted up.
[218:56.25]Um, why... I don't have any... Where are you?
[218:57.95]I don't have any guns.
[218:58.65]What's going on?
[218:59.05]I went up the... Yeah, this is the start of the level.
[219:00.95]We just did this, uh, two minutes ago.
[219:02.37]Oh, God, I just forgot.
[219:03.01]Whatever, let's just run.
[219:03.91]Um, all the trouble... Which we actually did not lose much progress.
[219:08.38]Think of all the trouble we've been going through, like alt-tapping and putting up and down and over.
[219:11.86]It wasn't even necessary.
[219:13.88]It's just going to be four hours.
[219:14.94]We could have had just a four-hour timer.
[219:20.20]I don't want to execute him.
[219:21.10]Can they hear my gunshot from here?
[219:24.08]Okay, don't shoot.
[219:24.90]Just take cover.
[219:27.79]Wait till they pass, and we're going to do the thing where we just run past the whole fight.
[219:33.33]Let's go.
[219:34.99]Did somebody give a lot of money?
[219:37.18]I can't see, unfortunately.
[219:39.20]At the end of the stream, I'm going to go check it out.
[219:40.92]So if you have given any money, then... I'm so sorry.
[219:44.80]I don't know what I was thinking.
[219:45.73]I don't know what I was thinking.
[219:46.49]I'm so sorry.
[219:46.89]Let me in.
[219:49.51]I don't know what I was thinking.
[219:52.17]Quick.
[219:52.79]We're good.
[219:54.23]Okay.
[219:54.33]All right.
[219:56.63]That guy did a head.
[219:58.77]Thanks for yelling that.
[220:03.60]Take two.
[220:04.48]Take two.
[220:04.96]If it doesn't crash this time.
[220:07.46]Plus 20 minutes.
[220:10.66]I should be going up.
[220:16.63]I need a gun.
[220:20.03]Give me one of these, please.
[220:22.91]Watch out.
[220:23.35]A lot of guys on the left.
[220:26.79]Way too many to be comfortable.
[220:31.88]Pretty good explosion.
[220:33.47]This is where I crashed last time.
[220:36.35]Don't do it again.
[220:37.35]I'm going to try to go a different way to not recreate it.
[220:41.85]So it can't happen.
[220:42.63]I'm moving in a different direction.
[220:46.12]We haven't had like a plus two joke for a long time.
[220:49.34]No, we haven't.
[220:50.22]Because we haven't been making any jokes.
[220:52.28]We've been too busy trying to beat the game.
[220:54.24]We're too busy trying to beat the game and not crash the game.
[220:57.42]Yes.
[220:58.54]We don't want the game to crash and we want to beat the game.
[221:08.03]One guy in the left.
[221:13.20]This is pretty serious.
[221:18.40]Plus two pity points.
[221:20.86]Why did he take two shots?
[221:23.56]Bullshit!
[221:26.90]If we played long enough, we are complaining about the game mechanics.
[221:30.03]That's so funny.
[221:31.63]Did you ever think you were going to be complaining about Kane and Lynch 2's gameplay mechanics?
[221:42.20]Yeah, just keep calm.
[221:44.24]Don't make too much noise.
[221:45.85]Be sneaky.
[221:47.75]They keep saying that at every level.
[221:49.57]Like, alright, be calm, be cool, take it easy.
[221:53.27]The elevator's crashing.
[221:55.21]That doesn't count as a plus 20, by the way.
[221:58.21]No, there wasn't a buffering screen.
[221:59.69]It's only on buffering screens.
[222:01.79]We both had the same idea, and it wasn't right.
[222:04.79]That's because these double doors just look like doors you're supposed to open.
[222:08.67]We just need to move.
[222:09.79]Found them.
[222:10.69]Found what?
[222:12.31]Found the Matrix office.
[222:15.15]Oh, right.
[222:16.43]Where he jumps through the window.
[222:18.19]That's a sweet slow-mo.
[222:25.15]Where are we off to?
[222:25.77]Easy.
[222:27.63]Don't get yourself killed.
[222:30.99]Honestly, this game would be about three times better with max pain slow-mo.
[222:36.69]He's still alive.
[222:39.35]Watch out for the helicopters.
[222:40.49]It's going to shoot in here right now.
[222:42.62]Wow!
[222:44.48]Holy God, that's a lot.
[222:46.92]You down?
[222:47.24]I think I forgot I existed.
[222:53.93]Where are you?
[222:54.55]I don't know.
[222:55.15]We've lost each other.
[222:58.17]Holy shit.
[222:59.25]There's still a guy back here.
[223:00.49]Yeah, and there's a machine gunner over here, too.
[223:05.27]Wish my gun was not as bad as... Um... I don't know why this guy's alive.
[223:18.20]He's finally dead.
[223:18.60]How does the helicopter know to shoot us?
[223:20.92]By the way, we can hit it.
[223:24.33]Hit the helicopter, you mean?
[223:26.49]Yeah, it has a health bar.
[223:28.35]I don't think we can kill this.
[223:30.31]Are we supposed to kill the helicopter right now?
[223:34.25]That's unheard of.
[223:35.63]I don't know.
[223:38.67]At this point, I'm not surprised by anything.
[223:40.85]No way.
[223:41.39]We need to get the machine gun from that thing the guy just dropped.
[223:43.49]Watch out.
[223:43.81]People coming on the left.
[223:46.49]On the left?
[223:52.29]I need to get the machine gun.
[223:54.77]Oh.
[223:56.74]Oh, you might need to come help me.
[223:58.56]Where?
[223:58.94]You might need to come help me.
[223:59.82]Where are you?
[224:01.30]Run to me right now.
[224:02.54]Oh, oh, oh.
[224:03.86]No, I'm not going to make it.
[224:04.86]I'm not going to make it.
[224:06.38]Where were you going so far?
[224:09.69]I didn't know that the whole room was full of enemies.
[224:12.57]Minus 10.
[224:13.15]I mean minus 5.
[224:14.37]Minus 5.
[224:15.37]I'm sorry.
[224:17.11]I didn't mean to.
[224:18.97]Let's go.
[224:20.25]Let's go.
[224:20.69]Come on.
[224:22.08]We have to beat this game on stream.
[224:26.20]It's not the whole level, it's just this room.
[224:29.02]One room.
[224:29.44]It's just this one room.
[224:32.14]That's insane.
[224:33.98]We just have to get forward.
[224:40.34]Why is my guy so talkative right now?
[224:42.46]Here comes the machine gun.
[224:48.96]Christ.
[224:50.58]That's way... oh boy.
[224:52.28]Alright, how you doing?
[224:54.68]I'm trying to fight the people that you ran past.
[224:57.44]I thought I ran past them because... Alright, got that guy.
[225:03.85]No, he's... What do you mean, he's what?
[225:06.27]Oh, no, he's dead.
[225:07.85]He was like in a crawling position.
[225:10.63]As if you hadn't.
[225:12.33]How many people are you running past?
[225:14.95]Where do you see these people?
[225:18.24]Oh, wait, no.
[225:19.20]I'm just in this room by myself.
[225:20.38]Yeah, you ran ahead to, like, the other room.
[225:24.19]You almost did that a second time.
[225:26.27]No, no, I wasn't going to go to the left room.
[225:28.11]I was just going to this room.
[225:29.01]All right, we have to obviously kill the guy with the machine gun and use the machine gun.
[225:31.73]I killed him.
[225:36.02]I'm going to try to get the machine gun.
[225:37.54]I got it.
[225:38.48]You got it?
[225:39.46]Yep.
[225:39.78]Okay.
[225:40.58]There's another machine gun guy right here.
[225:42.00]That's the room.
[225:43.70]That's the room.
[225:44.18]Careful.
[225:45.44]Careful.
[225:46.76]We gotta get to, like, actual cover.
[225:50.82]Is helicopter gone?
[225:52.30]No, I mean, it's on this side now.
[225:54.08]So, kinda.
[225:54.48]Watch out for the machine gunner.
[225:59.58]Alright, I gotta get that one.
[226:01.68]Machine gunner down.
[226:03.72]Uh, helicopter's circling back around.
[226:05.92]It's on this side.
[226:06.48]Give me the gun.
[226:13.14]Where is he?
[226:13.92]All right, you want to try to melt this guy?
[226:15.54]You want to try to melt the chopper?
[226:19.46]With the crash guns?
[226:20.24]Three, two, one, unload.
[226:24.32]Hide, hide.
[226:25.22]Oh, what was I thinking?
[226:27.56]What was I doing?
[226:28.40]He's dead.
[226:30.35]Chopper's dead.
[226:31.01]Okay, good.
[226:32.01]Keep going.
[226:35.23]Is this a keypad?
[226:36.39]No, he's a pride open.
[226:39.13]Oh, you pride open.
[226:40.19]I'll cover you looking cool.
[226:42.41]Crash gun.
[226:53.33]Okay, I think we can stop.
[226:56.79]Well, I don't have any more bullets, so yeah, I'm going to stop.
[227:05.83]Come on out, you little... Come on out, you little... Who's going to wish he was dead?
[227:14.42]I don't know who we're talking about.
[227:16.52]Oh, Shang-C.
[227:17.34]Who's that?
[227:17.90]Have we seen this character in the whole game?
[227:19.46]Wait.
[227:24.08]Did we kill the bad guy already?
[227:25.58]No, the main bad guy is called Shang-Zi.
[227:28.34]And he said if you find him, we have to stay calm.
[227:30.86]But I don't think we... Have we seen this character the entire game?
[227:33.52]I don't know.
[227:33.98]I have no idea.
[227:35.60]Did we just come in this door?
[227:37.54]Which way did we come in?
[227:38.76]We came in like that way, I think.
[227:40.91]I think this is the right way.
[227:41.93]There's like a... There's a freezer.
[227:45.75]Yeah, there's a smoky... Scary smoky door up here.
[227:50.25]The building's on fire.
[227:51.17]Yeah.
[227:52.90]Alright.
[227:53.54]There's people screaming.
[227:57.24]At this point, I think we just have to get out.
[227:59.70]Okay, lady.
[228:01.10]Lady, that doesn't count as our kill.
[228:02.46]That's not a civilian kill for us.
[228:05.38]We didn't do that?
[228:06.10]No, we didn't.
[228:06.68]We just gotta keep moving.
[228:08.31]Open the door.
[228:08.83]It is an actual meat locker.
[228:13.07]Wait, that wasn't smoke?
[228:14.73]No, it was smoke, but there's also meat in here.
[228:18.09]I hear screams.
[228:22.44]This looks like the guy's office, right?
[228:24.04]I think we deserve two points for something.
[228:26.72]I think we deserve two points for double machine gun.
[228:32.02]Excuse me.
[228:32.68]Okay, I'm out of machine gun bolts.
[228:33.48]Alright, there's a lot of guys.
[228:38.06]Did you see that?
[228:38.52]Did it go out the window?
[228:39.84]I hope it didn't go out the window.
[228:41.30]I'm going to shoot the guy right in the head when he pops up.
[228:47.50]Okay, that took a lot, but I got him.
[228:50.90]You want the machine gun?
[228:54.61]This was a mistake.
[228:55.33]This was a mistake.
[228:55.93]That was a mistake.
[228:56.57]Get back!
[228:59.39]What is this?
[228:59.97]Where's the machine gun?
[229:02.21]Find cover!
[229:02.45]I got it.
[229:03.43]You took too long.
[229:05.01]I couldn't find it.
[229:05.93]Alright, you go.
[229:09.44]Am I supposed to get in here?
[229:12.58]Uh, Talix, we're not supposed to fly the helicopter.
[229:15.84]Help!
[229:18.66]No time for helicopter jokes.
[229:19.99]It's fucking bent.
[229:21.19]It's broken.
[229:21.53]Alright, wait.
[229:22.03]Sit in the broken helicopter.
[229:23.61]Yeah.
[229:24.32]I'm about to go crash the game.
[229:25.20]Uh, I'm dying.
[229:27.28]So go get him.
[229:28.00]Go get him, Tiger.
[229:28.62]We can't stay down here!
[229:33.57]Okay.
[229:33.91]We can't stay down here.
[229:35.09]Or so I've been told.
[229:40.11]What?
[229:45.40]No, they just keep... Oh, God!
[229:47.90]Get the machine gun!
[229:48.96]Get the machine gun!
[229:52.06]Uh-oh.
[229:52.84]I'm being left for dead up here.
[229:53.98]Oh, whoa!
[229:56.36]I had to run.
[230:00.04]All right, run for the cover right next to me when you get full health.
[230:03.46]Okay, going.
[230:08.02]Just like turned around piano.
[230:09.24]All right, you got the machine gun?
[230:14.46]I have the machine gun.
[230:17.00]I do have the machine gun.
[230:18.06]Move up.
[230:23.37]All right, you go first, because you got the room clear.
[230:26.03]Okay.
[230:26.31]We're going to take this kind of slow.
[230:29.35]Oh, we're getting close to Shang-Chi.
[230:34.46]This is the executive floor.
[230:35.52]This is the end of the game.
[230:38.32]Here we go.
[230:38.80]Open the door.
[230:39.52]He's going to be in here smoking a cigar, and he's going to be like, well, you made it.
[230:43.12]You just went through the door.
[230:45.26]What?
[230:46.54]You're invisible.
[230:47.34]Oh, no.
[230:48.10]Hello, there you are.
[230:49.38]Okay, I was about to say, no way.
[230:52.53]It always looks like it's about to go to cutscene, and then it doesn't.
[230:54.73]I know.
[230:55.65]Alright, we still need to add two minutes for the double clear.
[230:58.73]Yeah, double clear, we get plus two.
[230:59.69]We're getting low.
[231:01.05]Well, not really.
[231:01.62]We're at 33.
[231:04.28]I'm at 34.
[231:05.02]34-12.
[231:05.80]Okay, this looks like one of the last rooms we can go in.
[231:12.67]You're grasping for straws here.
[231:15.01]I mean, maybe I am, but I mean...
[231:18.60]This looks like one of the last rooms we could go in.
[231:21.71]Like, if I was a game designer, this would be one of the last ones.
[231:25.41]I mean, this clearly is like... Are you clicking or are you shooting?
[231:27.69]I'm shooting.
[231:28.91]No, you're not on my screen.
[231:31.07]You're a small child playing pretend with a very large gun.
[231:33.13]I will turn around because they're coming around the left side.
[231:36.44]There's no bullets coming out of your gun.
[231:38.94]Well, that's weird.
[231:41.04]It should be.
[231:46.16]See, he's Trevor.
[231:47.00]He's just Trevor from Lincoln Park.
[231:49.14]What?
[231:52.48]Did you have to go and make a Lincoln Park joke?
[231:55.40]They're coming in the windows.
[232:04.79]I don't know where Lincoln Park came from, guys.
[232:06.43]I don't.
[232:07.31]I'm not sure.
[232:07.73]I'm trying to search for where that came from.
[232:11.75]Trying to search.
[232:16.10]There has to be a door.
[232:17.43]Alright, the machine gun's almost gone.
[232:23.65]I think, actually, you know what?
[232:24.43]I'm just gonna, like... Yeah, I gotta replace it.
[232:26.87]There's no bullets!
[232:29.21]Okay, whatever.
[232:30.94]Where are we supposed to go?
[232:32.00]They said, there's gotta be a door!
[232:36.76]Inside one of the other doors.
[232:39.20]Oh, this is it.
[232:39.62]I just heard an explosion.
[232:40.96]Um...
[232:45.44]You should probably back up.
[232:46.94]Just gonna say, you probably should back it up just a tad.
[232:49.51]No, we're good.
[232:50.65]We're good.
[232:51.59]Apparently we are.
[232:54.91]He wasn't dead.
[232:59.48]They really do pop out like a time crisis game.
[233:02.84]Yeah, you have to shoot him as many times as you do in time crisis.
[233:06.12]Are we at a fucking museum?
[233:10.46]Why are we at, like, the Smithsonian right now?
[233:12.50]What the hell is going on?
[233:13.82]What are, like, the stuffed zebras for?
[233:15.54]I don't know.
[233:16.54]Oh, God.
[233:18.12]How am I going to hide?
[233:18.92]You wouldn't have even known I was there.
[233:27.37]That's bullshit.
[233:31.81]Watch the back.
[233:32.57]Watch the back.
[233:33.37]Oh, there's so many.
[233:36.72]Use the kangaroos as cover.
[233:40.24]Until we have a safer means of exit.
[233:42.94]He's still alive.
[233:46.47]Moving up to the ramps or the whatever these are.
[233:50.57]To the bison.
[233:51.69]Moving up to the jackalopes.
[233:54.57]Moving up to the painted horses.
[234:01.06]What the hell are you doing?
[234:03.18]Jaguars.
[234:04.04]Plus three for the kangaroos.
[234:05.48]Plus two for the museum joke.
[234:06.70]Minus two for Lincoln Park.
[234:07.92]So it's even.
[234:11.13]I'm all turned around.
[234:12.13]Where the hell are we going?
[234:17.03]I don't know.
[234:17.57]I guess this way.
[234:19.01]Okay.
[234:19.77]Lots of co-op moment doors lately.
[234:24.20]This has got to be it.
[234:24.82]Is this where the guy's brain is linked up to the big computer?
[234:27.14]This is it.
[234:29.14]This is the big one.
[234:31.58]I told you.
[234:32.94]You made it just in time.
[234:35.59]Which guy is this?
[234:38.11]I don't know.
[234:39.49]Bad guy.
[234:40.01]He's the one that pushed us earlier when the van came in, right?
[234:42.85]When we were standing in the warehouse, he shoved us and turned on us.
[234:45.72]He was driving in the car with us, wasn't he?
[234:47.50]It's default bad guy in a suit, number 499.
[234:50.16]I can't even hear them over the wind.
[234:54.16]If I didn't have subtitles then, I couldn't understand anything.
[234:58.69]He's making us an offer.
[235:01.97]I'm sorry.
[235:02.35]I had to do it.
[235:06.11]Wow, that was cold.
[235:09.09]Oh, we get plus 10.
[235:22.81]Plus 10, beat a level.
[235:25.31]Don't know where it could possibly come next.
[235:27.01]I'm gonna wait till the buffering is done.
[235:28.30]I love how somebody just wrote, how are they still playing this?
[235:31.86]That's the challenge, we have to beat this game.
[235:35.72]In one sitting.
[235:37.38]Because heaven knows we're not ever going to load this game again.
[235:40.58]No, I... I'm going to uninstall this game the second we're done playing.
[235:45.06]And it will never be installed ever again.
[235:47.24]Even when I am like 70.
[235:48.41]Yeah, when I'm like 75.
[235:50.57]And I still have a Steam account.
[235:51.67]And my grandson wants to like play games.
[235:54.17]He's going to look at my profile.
[235:55.63]He's going to scroll all the way down my like all played list.
[235:58.99]You played four hours of Kane and Lynch 2?
[236:01.89]No, he's going to be like...
[236:02.93]Grandpa, what's this shit?
[236:04.29]Can I play Kane and Lynch 2?
[236:05.61]And I'm gonna fucking scream.
[236:07.35]And I'm gonna grab the fucking computer and slam it down.
[236:10.17]On my own fingers.
[236:14.41]And he's gonna leave the room.
[236:16.07]Implying I'll ever have kids.
[236:21.35]Okay.
[236:32.60]Now we're in like... Wait, hold on.
[236:34.40]Why are we different characters?
[236:37.06]Why are you me and I'm you?
[236:38.68]I've been... We switched sides.
[236:41.44]We got silenced pistols.
[236:42.88]Oh, nice.
[236:43.78]Just like James Bond.
[236:45.08]Why are we here?
[236:47.50]This is the last level.
[236:50.86]Is this the epilogue?
[236:53.04]I guess.
[236:53.84]The hangars are over... Go by the plane or something.
[236:56.16]I don't know.
[236:57.86]This would have actually been a cool looking level.
[237:01.67]So, do we have to go to the plane?
[237:02.73]Okay, apparently not.
[237:07.28]Where are we supposed to go?
[237:09.86]I think we just run this way towards the gas station.
[237:13.94]I need to go get some more spicy Cheetos.
[237:16.00]A gas station?
[237:18.38]There's no gas stations, like, just sitting... Oh, there's a bunch of guys guarding the gas station.
[237:24.55]Oh, we'll crouch.
[237:28.11]Where are you?
[237:28.97]Just hit Y if you want to see where I am.
[237:30.55]Just crouch and...
[237:32.63]Oh.
[237:33.84]They see you.
[237:35.62]They absolutely see you.
[237:41.70]Nah, you know, there's people over there with a gun.
[237:45.55]Hold on.
[237:46.05]Where's my silencer?
[237:48.09]I don't know.
[237:49.27]I think I'm going to keep the P going.
[237:51.81]You guys go out and get them.
[237:53.07]I'm going to keep the P going.
[237:55.48]What are you talking about?
[237:57.72]That guy didn't care.
[237:58.42]He was going to pee the whole time.
[238:00.96]Oh, hey, we've got the Twitch TV palace over here.
[238:04.04]I forgot to add the plus 10.
[238:05.08]Hold on.
[238:05.48]You've got to add the plus 10.
[238:12.25]We can sneak by again.
[238:13.31]I'm being told that the speed run time for this game on Xbox is 1 hour and 13 minutes.
[238:19.20]That's so funny.
[238:19.98]Oh, plus 2, by the way, for the guy peeing.
[238:25.43]It's a plus two.
[238:26.97]Alright, let's like try to sneak around here.
[238:28.95]They already saw us.
[238:29.99]No, they didn't.
[238:33.53]Okay, they all knew.
[238:34.55]As soon as I killed that guy, everyone knew.
[238:35.95]Who's this guy in the yellow jacket?
[238:40.57]I gotta interrogate the guy in the jacket.
[238:42.81]The fuck do you know about... What do you know about Shang Sun?
[238:46.55]He's dead.
[238:47.53]That was a civilian, probably.
[238:50.75]What was the guy's name?
[238:51.47]Shang Sung?
[238:52.57]Shang Si.
[238:54.35]What is Shang Sun?
[238:57.12]Uh, a name you made up.
[238:59.02]No, Shang Sun.
[239:00.68]Oh, it's a guy from Mortal Kombat that rips your soul out of your body.
[239:02.84]Oh.
[239:04.98]I'm... I'm fine.
[239:06.69]Just do as I say.
[239:13.77]What?
[239:21.93]Uh, help, help, get me.
[239:23.11]Help, help, get me.
[239:26.11]It's so fast.
[239:27.01]There's no way I get it.
[239:28.21]It's so fast.
[239:29.11]What the fuck?
[239:30.84]Why is it too well?
[239:31.92]We might we minus that's minus ten and minus two because I killed two civilians Minus ten yeah, minus five and minus two wife.
[239:39.82]Why ten because I died that's five.
[239:43.90]Oh You didn't die right okay?
[239:45.56]Yeah, yeah, we're at 30 Well, yeah, I was getting a little cocky because I was getting so many headshots.
[239:52.04]Oh
[240:03.62]Oh.
[240:05.28]Okay.
[240:07.52]Do you... It worked!
[240:09.71]Talix, it worked.
[240:10.31]Go.
[240:10.85]I'm still stuck back here.
[240:12.23]Maybe if I complete the level.
[240:15.31]I don't even know who's shooting me at this point.
[240:17.83]Alright, you just hang tight.
[240:19.39]No, I'm gonna die.
[240:20.29]No, I'm gonna die.
[240:21.05]I'm dead.
[240:25.01]Was it worth it?
[240:26.77]Yeah.
[240:27.13]Next time, be like, hey, by the way, I'm just going to run the whole way, so follow me.
[240:33.14]And then I'll be like, okay.
[240:34.28]No, I couldn't tell you, because then we would have lost time, because we needed to gain two seconds.
[240:37.16]Well, now we lost five minutes.
[240:38.62]We're down to 25 minutes.
[240:40.02]Hey, is your heart yet going to protect you?
[240:41.34]No, I'm not.
[240:41.90]No, that's minus one.
[240:44.55]Fuck.
[240:45.89]We have the least accurate pistols.
[240:47.49]I know.
[240:47.81]All right.
[240:48.11]What are we doing?
[240:49.63]Are we running?
[240:49.95]Honestly, I think we're supposed to, like, we're doing this all wrong.
[240:53.40]supposed to just run I think no no no we're not supposed to just like run but we're like well if we stick together we can pick each other up don't shoot me I'm not shooting you I can't shoot you all right let's go down I don't think we're supposed to go down here why is this this looks like it is it it's not this is oh maybe it is
[241:21.62]Well, that guy had a lot of fun.
[241:24.95]I'm stuck.
[241:26.51]I'm stuck.
[241:28.51]See?
[241:28.81]That was the strategy.
[241:31.21]Well, you doubted yourself.
[241:32.05]The guy's behind us, dude.
[241:34.57]Don't worry.
[241:35.37]They're fine.
[241:38.30]That guy's still living.
[241:40.34]You can't even be serious right now.
[241:42.40]Ladies and gentlemen, the guy's still alive.
[241:45.90]Are we good here?
[241:46.74]Are we ready?
[241:47.40]I guess we're good.
[241:52.00]I don't know.
[241:52.30]I kind of like the pistol, even though it sucks.
[241:54.28]You know?
[241:57.12]Um... Hi.
[242:00.86]We've come full circle.
[242:02.68]There's two ways to tackle any level here, ladies.
[242:06.01]This guy appeared out of nowhere.
[242:06.97]That's good.
[242:07.67]Two guys.
[242:08.93]Ready and waiting.
[242:09.85]Both guys appeared out of nowhere.
[242:10.79]That was odd.
[242:11.97]I have assumed the position.
[242:13.45]I'm coming.
[242:16.05]Hey, Kane.
[242:16.57]How's it going?
[242:18.11]So, what...
[242:18.94]You're me and I'm you.
[242:19.82]You're me and I'm you.
[242:21.12]Where's the supermarket?
[242:24.60]We just came up the sewers.
[242:27.25]And we're here at the private jet hangar.
[242:29.53]We don't know why we switched characters.
[242:31.35]It just happens for no reason.
[242:32.59]I can't tell you.
[242:33.49]He's got a dead eye.
[242:34.61]Keep my one eye peeled.
[242:45.91]If you didn't say anything, it would have been neutral.
[242:48.65]But you said to say something.
[242:49.81]It's minus two.
[242:51.05]It's minus two.
[242:52.19]You're right.
[242:52.51]Minus two.
[242:52.91]Alright, we sneak back here.
[242:59.13]Okay, stealth is no longer an option.
[243:08.30]Like, really.
[243:09.26]Why is there a crouch button in this game?
[243:11.32]There's no reason to have crouch.
[243:13.54]No, there's not.
[243:15.12]crouch doesn't do anything it just makes you move slower why are there so many people guarding this plane and why do the guys with no body armor take more hits than the guys with full body armor I don't know and why do they move around like bugs
[243:44.35]I think that's just how everyone moves by default.
[243:46.65]Hey, there's a lot of guns on that table, by the way.
[243:50.30]What?
[243:51.52]I am down here in the midst of all of them.
[243:54.62]I see you.
[243:56.00]But I'm doing pretty good for myself, honestly.
[244:01.28]They really do move around like ants.
[244:04.20]One more.
[244:06.58]Good to go.
[244:07.09]Let's check the... There's one more guy.
[244:10.27]No, there's more than one guy.
[244:13.63]That guy looks like a boss guy.
[244:15.01]What's up with that?
[244:15.85]Oh, that was really weird.
[244:17.34]This is the first, like, new model character that I've seen so far.
[244:20.48]All these guns suck.
[244:21.28]Or maybe it's just been so long that I don't remember.
[244:22.72]Oh, wait.
[244:22.88]Two super machine guns over here.
[244:25.02]Make sure you get one.
[244:26.88]Yeah, get one.
[244:28.24]Super machine guns.
[244:29.50]This is Crash Gun Rider.
[244:32.61]Look at all that money.
[244:34.31]Wasn't your character or my character just complaining about not getting money from that guy and we're leaving these boxes?
[244:39.51]There's boxes of money.
[244:41.13]Yeah, there's a lot of money just sitting around.
[244:46.02]Over here.
[244:47.48]I'm waiting at you.
[244:49.56]This game is a 4 out of 10.
[244:51.68]Yeah, it is.
[244:52.16]No, it's less than that.
[244:54.16]We have to judge it in terms of 2010, though.
[244:56.60]Like, of course now... Was it as bad back then?
[245:00.79]Also, is this guy on our team?
[245:02.07]No, he's a civilian.
[245:03.33]No.
[245:03.95]This guy's definitely not on our team.
[245:05.63]I'm yawning!
[245:06.49]Oh, God, I'm yawning.
[245:08.07]Oh, no.
[245:10.17]That's like one of my pet peeves is, like, streamer yawning.
[245:13.57]Oh!
[245:17.49]Well, to be fair, it is like 1 o'clock in the morning.
[245:20.83]Don't tell me what time is it.
[245:22.37]Don't tell me what to do.
[245:25.60]I think we should go this way.
[245:26.48]Don't tell me what to do.
[245:27.14]Wait, do we?
[245:28.04]Is this game bad for 2005?
[245:28.82]Stay out of sight.
[245:29.52]Okay, I'm going to use stealth.
[245:32.00]He sees us already.
[245:32.58]I pointed a gun at his face.
[245:34.14]Oh.
[245:47.42]If they open doors normally, they wouldn't have to worry about if people hear them.
[245:50.66]Somebody tell me what the Metacritic score for this game was.
[245:55.04]Pretty low.
[245:57.27]Watch out.
[245:57.85]Watch out.
[245:59.07]Lots of civilians in here.
[246:00.61]Lots of civilians.
[246:01.13]Lots of luggage, too.
[246:01.99]What are we supposed to do?
[246:04.97]Oh, they see us.
[246:06.41]Of course they do.
[246:08.08]Watch out for the predetermined... Remember the old SNES games or NES games?
[246:14.42]Where the bad guy pops up in the window.
[246:16.58]And the bad guy pops in the window.
[246:18.10]And then it's a person, a civilian you're not supposed to shoot.
[246:20.52]And you're like, ah, fuck.
[246:22.42]He's running across the screen.
[246:24.50]I shot him in the face.
[246:26.22]I'll take a minus one.
[246:28.64]I'll take a fucking minus 50.
[246:29.96]Okay.
[246:39.94]That's what you get.
[246:40.58]That's what you get.
[246:43.74]Well, we were just like dilly-dallying around, not shooting the random civilians that are running around like birds.
[246:51.87]Okay, FYI, apparently this game has like a 62% on Metacritic.
[247:00.53]In case you were curious.
[247:01.77]So what people thought about this game in 2010 was like 60, low 60.
[247:06.28]How did I not see that guy?
[247:14.05]Let's just get out of this.
[247:15.71]How many civilians is that?
[247:16.69]Like seven?
[247:20.46]Should there be like a clause where you can't lose more than five minutes at a time?
[247:24.52]It's like the mercy rule.
[247:26.31]Okay, you know, it's like the stroke rule in golf.
[247:28.27]Right here, right here.
[247:32.08]Yeah, when you get past like seven strokes in mini golf.
[247:35.52]That used to happen to me all the time, dude.
[247:37.32]It used to drive me fucking crazy.
[247:38.76]Alright, so we have to drop a minus five.
[247:41.66]I think it's two points for the mercy rule, though.
[247:43.98]Wait, where were we?
[247:44.82]Minus five?
[247:45.89]I think it was minus five plus two for the mercy rule.
[247:48.31]Okay, so where are you now?
[247:50.47]Thirteen minutes.
[247:51.49]Thirteen minutes, okay.
[247:52.59]I thought we had earned more funny jokes.
[247:54.45]No, we haven't been being funny at all.
[247:56.13]I'm about to be funny.
[247:58.64]I'm going to get us two points here.
[248:00.06]I'm going to get us two minutes.
[248:01.59]So, no, I'm not.
[248:02.55]Time's almost up.
[248:03.75]Let's just go.
[248:04.35]I can't make the fucking minute.
[248:05.79]Here's the long and short of it.
[248:07.47]Where the fuck am I?
[248:10.51]Okay.
[248:11.37]Down here.
[248:11.87]Didn't you hear my guy?
[248:18.31]What?
[248:19.83]I'm so confused.
[248:21.53]I just earned a bunch of points, but I lost one.
[248:23.05]I can't leave.
[248:23.77]I earned at least five points there.
[248:27.31]Okay, at least two.
[248:28.27]Where are you?
[248:30.35]Where are you?
[248:31.03]Where the fuck am I?
[248:32.45]I'm going to come back and find you.
[248:34.85]Coming back to find you.
[248:36.33]A two-minute show.
[248:37.56]I'm good, I'm good.
[248:38.06]All right, anyway, so the seven-stroke rule in mini-golf, you get really mad, and you get to seven strokes, and then you start doing the thing where you just drag the ball around, and then eventually you put it in the hole, and it's funny.
[248:50.81]Oh!
[248:51.05]Oh!
[248:53.74]What?
[248:54.22]Where are you?
[248:55.28]And where am I?
[248:55.90]Where are you?
[248:56.44]Keep going!
[248:58.26]Are you invisible?
[248:59.50]No.
[249:01.07]Hang on, hang on.
[249:01.65]You're invisible.
[249:02.77]I'm not invisible.
[249:03.69]I'm just like in a different place.
[249:05.09]I'm in a different part of the game.
[249:07.15]You're... I'm telling you.
[249:10.21]I'm in a different like... I think we're supposed to be... This is like one of those things where we do a co-op thing.
[249:14.20]And it splits us up.
[249:15.08]I think you like ran ahead somehow.
[249:17.32]Oh, no.
[249:18.58]Oh, no.
[249:19.16]I'm done.
[249:19.52]I'm dead.
[249:20.16]It's over.
[249:24.25]I have no idea how you got there.
[249:27.15]We have seven minutes to beat the game.
[249:28.75]No, no, no.
[249:29.53]What?
[249:29.95]I died.
[249:30.31]Oh, yeah, but I added two for some skill shots and lost one.
[249:36.38]Okay, so that's plus one.
[249:38.98]So we're at negative four for that.
[249:41.04]So that makes us at seven minutes.
[249:43.23]For me, it's seven minutes.
[249:44.25]Yes.
[249:44.35]All right, let's go.
[249:46.03]Seven minutes to beat this level.
[249:47.33]Seven minutes to beat the game.
[249:49.43]I got to think of some jokes here.
[249:51.13]I got to wait for you.
[249:52.11]Where are you?
[249:52.81]Where are you?
[249:53.67]There you are.
[249:54.19]I'm here.
[249:54.59]We're here.
[249:54.83]We split up.
[249:55.71]Oh, it is one of the co-op moments.
[249:58.03]Yes, it is.
[249:59.31]So now let's be careful.
[250:01.10]Yeah.
[250:01.66]There's a lot of people creeping around in here.
[250:03.30]Yes, there are.
[250:07.24]I'm being shot at and I... Are you fucking kidding me?
[250:10.62]Like, you can't be fucking serious here right now.
[250:13.67]I... Oh my god.
[250:14.67]There's guys with machine guns in the top corners.
[250:19.35]That guy... That guy dies that easily.
[250:21.39]And I shot that same guy.
[250:23.21]I'm not even gonna... I'm not even gonna complain about it.
[250:25.25]That was fucking outrageous.
[250:30.20]Gotta reload.
[250:31.82]He's dead.
[250:32.10]Okay, the guys up top are dead.
[250:34.71]Still work.
[250:35.13]I got a maze down here.
[250:36.43]Like I'm literally walking through a maze.
[250:38.37]You do have a maze.
[250:40.05]But I can't really get a position to shoot anybody.
[250:41.71]Uh-oh.
[250:45.91]Be careful.
[250:46.71]You okay?
[250:48.51]Ow, fuck!
[250:50.31]Think I'm okay.
[250:51.85]God.
[250:52.71]And all these guns are so bad.
[250:56.06]How am I ever supposed to be... No way.
[250:59.34]I'm gonna come down to you.
[251:01.54]How many guys do you have left over there?
[251:03.37]Uh, two or three.
[251:03.97]Oh, there's more now.
[251:05.55]There's a lot more now.
[251:11.33]I'm about to go down.
[251:11.89]No, just hide.
[251:13.39]Just hide.
[251:14.03]I'm going to try to help you.
[251:14.69]I can't.
[251:15.15]I'm in the open.
[251:16.55]I'm just trying to shoot random people.
[251:20.45]With my little fucking pea shooter.
[251:21.79]They're advancing on me.
[251:24.79]They're moving up.
[251:25.43]I've got five bullets left.
[251:27.42]Well, I don't have very much either.
[251:28.66]He's shooting me from above.
[251:29.59]Stay down, stay down, stay down.
[251:30.47]There's two people shooting me from above.
[251:32.37]Just stay down.
[251:32.93]Just stay down.
[251:33.57]Don't run.
[251:33.93]I'm making a run.
[251:35.47]I have four bullets.
[251:37.89]I have five bullets.
[251:40.03]I'm out.
[251:40.29]I'm out of bullets.
[251:40.81]I have to run down and fucking help you.
[251:43.88]Pick up a gun.
[251:45.26]I'm going to be a distraction.
[251:47.16]I have nothing.
[251:49.86]I got to get covered down here.
[251:50.84]Hopefully I can fucking do it.
[251:53.31]Okay, I have nothing.
[251:55.23]I have nothing.
[251:57.83]I've got, like, aim hacks on.
[251:59.47]Every time I aim down sights... They're all pulled to me.
[252:02.45]So, like, just fire away at these guys.
[252:06.16]Uh-oh.
[252:07.34]You okay?
[252:08.22]Yep.
[252:11.52]Oh, shit.
[252:12.34]I got pretty much nothing, though.
[252:16.44]I gotta make a run for it.
[252:17.26]I gotta try to... Is there any gun anywhere around you?
[252:23.93]None with bullets.
[252:29.53]Oh, to locate weapons.
[252:31.09]Okay.
[252:33.33]Yeah, there's like a couple.
[252:34.17]I'm going for it.
[252:38.51]Shotguns almost exclusively, unfortunately.
[252:40.99]Okay, but it's alright.
[252:47.10]Are we good?
[252:47.82]Somehow we have to get the guys up top.
[252:51.14]Do we have like two minutes?
[252:52.62]How many minutes are left?
[252:53.80]How many minutes do we have?
[252:54.68]That's true.
[252:56.58]Let's just go.
[252:57.12]Go for the exit.
[252:58.08]Right here.
[252:58.88]Come in.
[252:59.26]Come in.
[252:59.76]I can't.
[253:00.14]I can't.
[253:00.40]I'm being fired on.
[253:02.32]And he's still alive.
[253:04.12]Oh, no.

[255:17.32]We did it!
[255:19.04]We did it!
[255:20.06]That's the end of the game.

[255:23.19]With 45 seconds remaining, the credits are rolling!
[255:27.59]He's screaming.
[255:33.11]Hold on, that can't be it.
[255:36.44]30 seconds to spare.
[255:40.10]And it could have just been a regular four-hour countdown timer.
[255:44.98]We didn't have to do any of the shit we've done the entire stream.
[255:48.54]None of it.
[255:49.86]What the fuck is that?
[255:50.52]What's that noise?
[255:51.08]What's going on?

[256:03.73]What's the noise?
[256:07.19]That's what happens when the timer runs out.
[256:11.70]Wait, what?
[256:13.24]I haven't heard it.
[256:13.78]Just let your timer run out.
[256:14.80]It's going to scare the shit out of you.
[256:17.62]Oh, shit.
