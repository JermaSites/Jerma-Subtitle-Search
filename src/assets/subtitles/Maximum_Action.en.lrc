[00:01.03]Hey, let me grab my phone.
[00:02.94]Give me one second.
[01:14.46]Alright.
[01:17.27]I left my phone downstairs.
[01:18.55]Let me just make a tweet.
[01:25.24]And I'll be with you shortly.
[02:05.42]Good afternoon.
[02:09.57]Continuing our stream journey from yesterday.
[02:13.05]I said I was going to play max action, maximum action today, right now.
[02:24.86]Does anyone actually believe that Jerm is a real person?
[02:36.27]Anywho, I'm going to turn it on.
[02:39.78]This game is an action game.
[02:41.78]Of course it is.
[02:43.54]No, no, it's a reading game.
[02:47.58]This is a second grade reading, teaching second graders how to read.
[02:55.88]Imagine naming your game Maximum Action, and it's just a reading game.
[03:02.59]I'm going to do that.
[03:03.33]I should do that.
[03:11.06]Where's Terraria?
[03:15.32]Uh, you're going to have to ask Mr. Star that question.
[03:18.42]Because Terraria, his computer was broken last time I talked to him.
[03:23.93]And he was like, shit, my PSU.
[03:26.17]I think I got that right.
[03:29.17]Power supply.
[03:29.77]I don't know.
[03:35.99]Maybe this weekend.
[03:36.79]We'll see what he's doing.
[03:42.46]Putt-Putt's Adventure.
[03:43.50]But, hope you're having a good day.
[03:48.04]Let's get started.
[03:50.46]I have the game up.
[03:52.88]Now, I don't know how much content is in this game.
[03:58.37]I think there's probably like less than an hour or two of content.
[04:02.03]So, from here... We are going to play probably Rollercoaster Tycoon 2.
[04:11.83]Michael Action.
[04:13.21]Wait, it's a movie.
[04:16.35]Michael Action Maximum Productions.
[04:21.68]Oh, no, no, no.
[04:22.10]That's a placeholder.
[04:22.86]Okay, how about... Just call me Mike.
[04:38.72]Movie studio name.
[04:39.64]How about, uh... I don't think this even matters.
[04:51.05]We don't care about this paid promotion.
[04:52.75]What are you... I don't do those!
[05:00.17]Paid promotion!
[05:05.20]Uh...
[05:10.41]This is not... That's a good title.
[05:26.86]It's like Half-Life characters.
[05:38.22]Alright, there it is.
[05:39.94]I guess.
[05:40.38]Wait, no, it's gotta be, like, the Jerma colors, right?
[05:49.12]This is gloves.
[05:51.26]Outer body, let's go... There we go.
[05:54.85]Lower body.
[05:58.63]Glove.
[05:58.99]No, we need more blue.
[06:05.37]Change of glasses, too.
[06:14.28]Alright.
[06:14.70]That looks alright.
[06:17.99]Tutorial.
[06:19.03]All scenes are a work in progress.
[06:20.21]Maybe missing assets, textures, or gameplay elements are not representative of final product.
[06:25.49]So this game is about... It's kind of like a combination of what I'm told is Max Payne, John Wick, and Hotline Miami.
[06:34.36]It was a recommendation.
[06:35.18]It looked interesting.
[06:35.90]I felt like I wanted to play it.
[06:44.57]Alright.
[06:45.18]How are we doing?

[18:07.65]How close do I have to be to get the gun?
[18:17.36]Free bolts.
[18:22.56]I did it!

[21:34.49]I was too... insane.
[21:37.31]Oh god.
[22:13.68]I'm on an action movie.
[22:14.66]It's a Call of Duty camper.

[24:34.04]Which way do I go?
[24:37.22]Where do I go?
[24:37.60]Where do I go?
[24:37.92]Where do I go?
[24:45.33]Over here.
[24:48.83]What?
[24:50.32]Is it a boss?
[24:51.66]Oh god, I think it's a boss.
[25:38.31]Ow, that's so loud in my ears.
[25:50.74]Slide!
[25:51.76]Away from the fight!
[26:01.29]I turned the sensitivity too high.
[26:08.76]I did it!
[26:11.24]Here we go.
[26:15.38]It's too loud.
[26:17.92]Alright, let's watch the movie.
[26:21.88]Alright.
[26:53.10]I'm lost.
[27:01.06]The actor doesn't even know where to go.
[27:04.53]Come on, Chaz.
[27:06.29]You've really fucked it up.
[27:07.89]You missed your marks like five times.
[27:54.68]That was so stupid.
[27:59.83]I dove on my own grenade.
[28:01.41]There we go.
[28:08.35]Switch out.
[28:08.85]This is when I'm trying to figure out how to switch weapons.
[28:12.22]Good job, Chaz.
[28:17.58]Fucking so loud.
[28:18.60]I have to turn it down.
[28:42.10]That's something, it sure is.
[28:53.43]Coming up next is the sprites.
[28:58.79]Is Straits available?
[28:59.45]Yeah.
[28:59.55]Alright, I'm going to try to do something actual cool, okay?
[29:05.85]Actually cool.
[29:06.69]I'm going to do the... It's going to be stealth moving.
[29:31.31]So far, not bad.
[29:38.32]Nevermind.
[29:43.06]I can still do it, I think.
[30:03.96]Okay.
[30:49.16]Alright.
[30:50.48]Movie's still going.
[30:51.90]I need health.
[30:59.75]No!
[30:59.99]Whoops!
[31:00.87]Where's the gun?
[31:01.81]I lost my stealth gun.
[31:15.34]Out of bullets.
[31:16.66]What's that?
[31:24.10]Damn it, give it to me.
[31:29.53]I need health.
[31:36.61]Oh my god, I'm almost dead.
[31:40.09]Oh, fuck.
[31:41.89]Alright.
[31:44.35]This movie's too long.
[31:58.96]Okay.
[32:40.84]What happened?
[32:55.05]Oh my god, that guy blew up.
[33:07.88]I just press the button?
[33:14.62]I kind of want to do that one again, just run and press the button.
[33:36.71]Good shot on the wall.
[33:43.36]Oh, I double stopped that guy.
[34:01.74]I think I can get it.
[34:03.04]I think I can slow-mo run through the whole level.
[34:05.66]And just jump and types of things.
[34:12.87]Why am I going backwards?
[34:22.78]Was that my voice?
[34:24.60]Didn't I go like... I screamed there, didn't I?
[34:36.04]I'm gonna try that again.
[34:38.52]I think I can do it.
[34:42.11]Ready?
[34:42.33]I just have to believe.
[35:16.14]Jump off the wall.
[35:17.66]Jump off the wall.
[35:20.09]No!
[35:21.27]Alright, still worked.
[35:43.07]Stuck.
[35:44.99]Somebody up top there, right?
[35:52.72]They're still chasing me.
[35:56.64]Oh, shit!
[35:59.38]Just touch the button.
[36:05.48]I did it!
[36:05.78]Okay, good.
[36:12.98]Let's see how that one turned out.
[36:29.95]I really didn't want to shoot anyone.
[36:31.39]Did I jump on top of the bullet?
[37:04.68]This is the kind of edit where this is a flashback sequence.
[37:11.90]This is not even happening in real time.
[37:13.52]This is just... I'm having a vision flashback scene.
[37:18.26]What the fuck is going on?
[37:19.48]That didn't happen.
[37:20.97]He shot me that many times?
[37:22.07]I don't remember that.
[37:32.64]You can die in the recording.
[37:34.16]Alright.
[37:36.08]Restaurant.
[37:37.88]Thank you PJFS for the five community subs and Chris Bach for the five community subs as well.
[37:42.17]Here we go.

[38:49.37]Give me the health!
[38:51.15]Get the health, please!
[38:54.29]I jumped over it!
[38:55.01]Fuck!
[39:31.89]Give me the shotgun.
[39:33.51]Give me the shotgun.
[39:45.31]Okay, I have two health.
[39:46.75]I gotta do this right.
[39:48.25]Just throw a grenade out there.
[40:29.93]What?
[40:30.25]That wasn't a headshot?
[40:30.89]Alright, here we go.
[41:16.08]What?
[41:20.17]Ah, fuck.
[41:22.39]Press P. Sand... box.
[41:45.76]Alright, let's go!
[42:04.08]Okay, why didn't you tell me I could do that?
[42:09.45]Let me beat the levels first.
[42:26.06]Oh, that was so loud in my ears!
[42:47.27]Can't be over here!
[42:49.55]Oh, just throw a grenade!
[42:50.61]No, don't throw it in your trajectory!
[43:08.09]Alright, let me relax for a second.
[43:19.56]What the fuck was that?
[43:25.78]Was it a grenade that he threw?
[43:27.30]I didn't know they could throw grenades.
[43:55.29]I can do that shit too.
[44:06.74]I got it, that's gonna be a good scene.
[44:09.04]Alright, got 86 health.
[44:14.56]Here we go, this is it.
[44:19.79]Where did they go?
[44:20.29]What?
[44:20.45]Why are they not there?
[44:23.74]I just blew up the fucking health.
[44:24.76]Oh my god, give me a break.
[44:46.92]Get in there!
[44:52.42]Where's the guy with the laser?
[44:53.58]This guy with the laser.
[44:54.30]Laser.
[44:54.50]Where's the guy with the laser?
[45:06.94]What?
[45:24.93]That just hurt.
[45:25.49]Alright, I made it.
[45:27.55]Watch this funny thing at the end.
[45:35.11]No!
[45:37.95]I wanted to watch the... I can just do better this time.
[46:15.47]No, I did it again!
[46:16.21]Dammit!
[46:20.49]Okay, I'm fine.
[46:38.06]What?
[46:38.20]He can shoot through walls?
[46:45.52]Alright, this is the big scene at the end here.
[46:47.28]Big finish.
[46:47.74]How do I want to do this?
[46:53.43]Grenade off the wall.
[46:54.07]Ready?
[47:10.84]Got it.
[47:19.93]Let's watch the movie.
[47:35.24]Did I just drop the gun?
[47:36.36]Oh, I dropped the gun.
[47:36.98]I'll pick up another one.
[47:55.86]Press V. V. Why do you want this angle?
[48:01.87]This angle sucks.
[48:02.83]You can't see anything.
[48:05.91]It's just this guy.
[48:06.91]There's nothing here.
[48:12.67]What an intense action movie this is, right guys?
[48:23.93]No, it's not free cam.
[48:25.13]I can't move around.
[48:30.08]How do you move around?
[48:31.90]I'm stuck here.
[48:38.86]Arrow keys?
[48:41.91]No, it's not the arrow keys.
[48:44.29]Okay.
[49:02.75]Number pad?
[49:06.92]No, it's not the number pad.
[49:14.28]Press P. Alright, we'll do... Let me go through each level first.
[49:19.03]Alright, jungle.
[49:23.99]I'm gonna make this one worth watching.
[49:26.65]Ready?
[49:26.83]Ready?
[49:31.95]30 bullets in each one.
[50:04.04]Get down.
[50:10.06]Catch it.
[50:10.94]Catch it.
[50:11.26]I think I just... Did I shoot myself?
[50:20.23]I think I just shot myself in the back of the head.
[50:30.72]Oh.
[50:47.49]What just blew up behind me?
[50:54.33]Who's shooting this?
[50:57.38]Okay.
[50:57.88]I need health.
[50:58.38]Health is over here.
[50:59.16]Oh my god.
[50:59.68]Okay.
[51:00.16]I can't fuck this up.
[51:18.29]Does this have any more?
[51:20.54]Look, this has 60 rounds?
[51:22.94]Why does this have so... Look at all this!
[51:26.04]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[51:27.72]Where do I go from here?
[51:41.18]Health?
[51:54.33]Whoa, somebody else is firing.
[51:57.74]Do a rocket jump.
[51:58.78]No, I'll die instantly.
[52:00.46]I gotta jump up and hit this guy.
[52:04.80]I just snuck it over.
[52:06.68]Just barely snuck it over.
[52:07.90]Okay, hold on.
[52:16.01]Fuck.
[52:17.17]Oh shit, he's here.
[52:29.59]Exit.
[52:30.21]I did it.
[52:30.52]Oh, he has a rocket launcher.
[52:38.46]Get rid of his rocket launcher first.
[52:39.58]Alright, I got him.
[52:46.50]Minimal action.
[52:53.61]Can I time?
[52:55.21]Can I shoot one in the air?
[52:56.07]Is this going to come back down?
[53:02.71]I don't think so.
[53:10.11]Like, five hands.
[53:13.41]You had the worst rocket jump of all the TF2 YouTubers.
[53:16.23]I don't... Alright.
[53:17.97]Who cares?
[53:47.62]Where am I?
[53:59.71]Oh my god, why are there rocket launchers over here?
[54:07.87]You're rubbing your butt on the ground like a dog.
[54:14.17]Look at this hesitation.
[54:20.91]Because I know I would blow myself up in a second with this thing.
[54:26.87]Complete fear.
[54:43.38]What?
[54:52.69]Oh yeah!
[54:53.79]Wait, did I hit a guy from across the map?
[54:59.03]I think I hit a guy direct across the map!
[55:05.00]Did that happen?
[55:07.06]Hold on a minute.
[55:13.90]Let's take a look at that again.
[55:22.32]I love this.
[55:24.46]I love this stupid action movie movie.
[55:29.53]It's so janky.
[55:49.21]This is the third game you've played in a row where you're making a movie.
[55:55.57]Well, I mean, I just went fishing yesterday.
[56:03.32]I didn't know that this had this.
[56:05.44]I thought it was just an action game.
[56:08.52]This makes it so much more interesting for me.
[56:18.05]Alright, pay attention here.
[56:20.99]So I jump... I think I... do I shoot somebody accidentally?
[56:24.45]Oh no, okay, I was aiming for that guy, I guess.
[56:30.68]It was different cut last time.
[56:41.47]The audio's breaking.
[56:45.19]Maximum Coward is what somebody said.
[56:49.62]Okay, uh, this is fun.
[56:51.02]Alright, let's go back to the room.
[56:57.64]Okay, the saloon.
[56:58.46]Alright, I'm gonna do a cowboy movie here.
[57:06.79]Single action.
[57:21.44]How is that guy still standing up?
[57:34.93]Get this fucking door out of here.
[57:36.57]What?
[57:37.75]Was he shooting me on the ground?
[57:53.53]Double kicked that guy.
[58:22.33]Who's next?
[58:36.12]Give me that one.
[58:37.62]Good catch, fourth arm.
[58:46.23]Wait, hold on a second.
[58:47.23]Let me reload the gun.
[58:47.87]Okay.
[59:05.87]Wait, wait, timeout, timeout, timeout, timeout, timeout, timeout.
[59:08.23]Okay, timeout.
[59:09.94]Alright.
[59:19.38]Oh, shit.
[59:20.00]That was loud.
[59:21.51]I need to get rid of this.
[59:22.53]No, get rid of this.
[59:23.99]It's not Maximum Coward.
[59:25.79]It's called I Need to Have a... Get rid of one of these.
[59:28.85]Oh, shit.
[59:30.79]No, get rid of this.
[59:31.71]How many?
[59:39.30]Somebody has their arms behind me.
[59:42.11]Like, whose line is it anyways?
[59:43.61]I'm not a coward.
[59:50.25]I just don't want to die here.
[59:51.35]Okay, here we go.
[59:58.48]Ow!
[60:10.65]I'm just slowly falling down the stairs.
[60:15.13]Alright, I got lots of ammo in this thing.
[60:33.48]What the fuck?
[60:35.48]How many times do you have to shoot a guy in the fucking face?
[60:42.97]Oh.
[60:43.69]My.
[60:44.31]God.
[60:44.73]I shot that guy like four times!
[60:57.92]I shot that guy like three times in the face!
[61:16.51]Okay.
[61:45.86]Fuck.
[61:48.70]What's with the doors?
[61:55.13]What?
[61:56.15]That's impossible.
[62:18.14]Oh, fuck!
[62:19.58]This one's hard.
[62:51.75]Oh shit!
[63:08.30]Do I have a gun?
[63:09.84]That guy's got a gun!
[63:10.68]That guy has a gun!
[63:17.80]That's who shot me last time.
[63:21.98]No, don't... I didn't fucking hit once, I'm dead.
[63:27.72]Is that it?
[63:48.24]Ooh!
[64:01.80]Oh my god, throw a grenade up there.
[64:22.11]No, please!
[64:25.81]Are they dead?
[64:26.45]Alright, get me up there.
[64:42.31]Oh, my God.
[65:26.11]Am I- I'm not even st-
[65:54.97]I'm about to just...
[66:25.52]Jesus!
[66:38.12]Here we go.
[66:39.44]The camera doesn't know where it wants to be.
[66:46.70]You can see how... You can see how upset I was right here.
[66:50.82]Like, I have to do this again.
[66:53.56]I was really, really trying right here.
[67:11.71]I didn't do that!
[67:13.75]I did not do that!
[67:14.71]That was added in!
[67:29.28]Oh shit, I gotta run!
[67:32.26]Got him.
[67:41.63]I wish it captured the voice too, so you can just hear me.
[68:04.65]What was going on here?
[68:11.34]Oh, the guy had a gun, right?
[68:21.70]Camera!
[68:28.08]Yeah, that had 2 HP.
[68:43.59]Why did I let... what?
[68:45.95]Why did I drop the gun?
[68:49.60]I didn't let go of the gun.
[68:56.62]What am I doing?
[68:57.49]Waving at them?
[68:58.19]That guy just landed on his head.
[69:04.77]I am so confused.
[69:05.85]I am telepathically beating these people up with my fists.
[69:12.34]Okay, this makes no sense.
[69:25.37]Yeah, this is my favorite scene in the movie.
[69:52.15]Stop looking down.
[69:58.34]You know you're having a real problem when you're looking straight at your feet.
[70:19.31]This time more with feeling.
[70:22.29]Oh yeah, I'm trying to jump off the walls now, I think.
[70:29.31]Nope.
[70:31.85]Just trying to get leverage from the... bar.
[70:34.47]Alright, this is crouch jump, crouch jump!
[70:44.58]Crouch jump wasn't doing it either.
[71:39.51]That was a great movie.
[71:42.29]Yes, fantastic.
[71:50.28]Uh, Arctic.
[71:53.64]I'm gonna try to get only headshots.
[72:25.49]Oh, that's a grenade!
[72:26.85]Is that another grenade?
[72:32.53]Okay, we're good.
[72:58.25]He walked over to it.
[73:00.15]Oh my god.
[73:00.82]I don't know.
[73:07.06]I mean, that was very clearly... That was a headshot.
[73:13.13]It was.
[73:26.53]I need health.
[73:26.97]Is there health back here?
[73:28.29]Something blew up.
[73:47.51]Oh fuck.
[73:58.16]That is the ultimate panic.
[74:10.19]Is that it?
[74:10.59]I think that's it.
[74:24.53]Oh, no.
[74:36.17]I don't like how quiet this is.
[74:43.90]I can hit once, I'm dead.
[75:15.08]Health?
[75:15.44]Anywhere?
[75:18.02]I'm almost out of ammo.
[75:29.13]I think there's health right there.
[75:30.39]Is he dead?
[75:34.93]Yes.
[75:39.68]Got it!
[75:45.35]Oh shit.
[75:51.07]I want the one with the ammo.
[76:03.51]What's in there?
[76:04.22]Double health.
[76:05.40]Oh yeah.
[76:23.71]I have to go down?
[76:24.35]Did I open it?
[76:44.25]Can I just get down there from here?
[76:48.57]I think this is the action shot where I jump all the way down.
[77:01.16]Got it
[77:27.61]Bingo.
[77:31.21]That's gonna be a good one.
[77:32.47]That was a first try scenario.
[77:46.40]What is this?
[77:47.02]Oh, I thought... Oh, headshots only, I remember.
[77:58.13]That was so violent.
[77:59.45]I love when you dive backwards and just stick your legs up.
[78:29.72]That's all a dive is, is you just fold your legs back.
[78:35.60]Did I die?
[78:37.00]That's like a, oh, you got me.
[78:38.80]No, he's still alive.
[79:08.04]Just trying to make it look interesting.
[79:22.41]I had 2 HP this whole time.
[79:35.44]Hmm.
[79:36.92]I wonder.
[79:38.54]That door doesn't open.
[79:41.12]No, that one doesn't open either.
[79:45.38]I guess we're gonna go this way now.
[79:50.28]You can just feel the internal monolog.
[80:05.70]Why would the camera be in the ground pointing up?
[80:09.60]I think you just won't, like, have a static.
[80:22.08]That guy got... a few shots.
[80:26.37]Not a whole lot.
[80:27.13]Not very many.
[80:45.41]This is so stupid.
[80:55.12]I just took one right in the throat.
[81:00.40]That was like right into my jugular.
[81:13.53]I need to play dubstep.
[81:30.68]See, this is the point, I remember right here, this is the point where everyone was screaming blind.
[81:40.58]Blind.
[81:41.06]Blind.
[81:41.66]Turn around.
[81:42.48]Turn around.
[81:43.16]You are so dumb.
[81:44.60]You missed it.
[81:45.10]Blind.
[81:45.44]Wait, no.
[81:45.88]Where is it?
[81:46.84]Over here.
[81:47.28]Oh, sorry.
[81:54.95]Can you hear the sound?
[81:57.47]Those little... The audio is compressing into itself.
[82:02.97]What are you showing me?
[82:12.17]Oh, I'm trying to... Yeah, right.
[82:13.29]I was trying to jump over.
[82:15.53]Now that was a good shot.
[82:16.63]I wish they stayed on it.
[82:28.03]That's not what happened.
[82:32.85]I landed with such explosive ferocity.
[82:37.95]That's the end of that one.
[82:46.10]Alright.
[82:47.30]We have rooftop.
[82:49.16]I think that's the last one until I'm going to just do... I'm going to make my... I'm going to just go into the editor and mess around.
[82:57.57]Rooftop.
[83:10.94]Alright.
[83:46.31]Okay, at least it worked.
[83:48.29]Where's his gun?
[83:50.93]Where's the guy's gun?
[83:56.13]Did I get him?
[83:56.77]I don't even know if I got him.
[84:15.36]Where are their guns?
[84:16.04]Alright, do not drop it.
[84:20.78]Is this guy still... Okay, they don't have any guns.
[84:36.89]I'll take that.
[84:43.82]Don't go too far!
[84:44.62]No, no, no, don't, don't, don't!
[84:54.17]That was really easy.
[84:56.61]That was really easy.
[85:26.91]so
[86:11.66]Now where do I go?
[86:12.22]I'm just not going to snipe this guy from really far away.
[86:30.03]Watch this.
[87:02.62]Adam Sandler.
[87:03.84]That's not Adam Sandler.
[87:05.12]Alright, exit up there.
[87:15.34]It is, isn't it?
[87:26.98]Wait, no, is that, where do I go?
[87:42.13]That way, that's where I came from.
[87:47.53]Ramp, what do you mean, was it ramp?
[87:49.13]Ramp?
[87:53.71]Under there, what do you mean under there?
[87:57.97]Go under there.
[87:58.71]What do you mean under?
[88:00.93]Over here?
[88:01.35]Alright, ramp.
[88:07.48]Found the ramp.
[88:08.96]Don't fall off this shit.
[88:12.46]Oh my god!
[88:13.38]Okay, I'm fine.
[88:15.28]I didn't think there was a gap.
[88:17.36]I just screamed really loud because this is a good run.
[88:34.70]Okay, there's a... Lead the target.
[89:03.22]I just fucking missed.
[89:11.18]That wasn't even where I was aiming.
[89:20.31]Am I lying down?
[89:21.85]I'm lying on my back.
[89:27.45]Why can I not hit this thing?
[89:37.03]Oh my... Yeah!
[89:54.10]Guys, how did I still get that?
[89:57.23]There's no way.
[89:59.71]Oh, I can't hit this.
[90:10.28]Nice.
[90:14.52]Double.
[90:21.27]Print it.
[90:25.65]Really?
[90:33.72]Oh, fuck.
[90:34.28]I have no... Oh...
[90:41.94]I don't want to do this too far... too much in front of my own face.
[90:47.83]No, he's getting too close!
[90:48.73]What do I do?!
[90:56.23]What?! !
[91:12.25]I don't want to explode too fast!
[91:17.88]Okay.
[91:23.59]Oh shit!
[91:39.06]Get it again.
[91:39.52]Get it again.
[91:39.88]Get it again.
[91:40.24]Get it again.
[91:40.62]Get it again.
[91:41.04]Get it again.
[91:41.50]Get it again.
[91:41.86]Get it again.
[91:42.22]I can do it twice.
[91:42.82]I can do it twice.
[91:43.38]It's gonna be the end of the movie.
[91:44.24]Right here.
[91:44.54]The end of the movie.
[91:45.06]Final scene of the movie.
[91:45.82]Here it is!
[91:49.02]I can get it.
[91:51.48]I can get it.
[91:52.06]I can get it.
[91:52.64]I can get it.
[91:53.40]I can get it.
[92:06.58]Get out of here!
[92:08.02]I did it!
[92:08.90]It's over!
[92:09.44]That was a six minute movie.
[92:22.67]Here we go.
[92:23.69]Let's take a look.
[92:42.46]I was trying to jump off the other side.
[93:04.98]So fucking bad.
[93:06.18]I got him.
[93:26.37]Okay, good.
[93:29.03]Am I gonna try the other modes?
[93:31.59]Oh, absolutely.
[93:35.50]This is where I'm searching for the gun, but I can't find it.
[93:44.60]Acid base?
[93:45.14]I can't stop this right now.
[93:47.10]I'm afraid to.
[93:50.48]I feel like if I hit escape or something, it'll ruin everything.
[94:07.85]Play it from your phone.
[94:11.81]I can do that.
[94:12.33]Alright, here we go.
[94:47.16]Thank you.
[95:17.08]It didn't even show it.
[95:46.49]This didn't happen!
[95:48.70]This didn't fucking happen!
[96:21.60]Why is the helicopter still there?
[96:29.41]I'm so confused right now Landing and taking off
[97:19.95]That looks cool though, it does.
[97:31.07]This thing's not gonna go in to the glass that I jumped through, right?
[98:03.11]This looks way, way worse than what I thought it was looking like when I was playing.
[98:25.62]Now wait a minute, this is where it happens.
[98:30.24]There's two more helicopters that come up.
[98:37.69]Right?
[98:41.42]What is happening?
[98:49.58]I did not hit that.
[98:51.87]I did not do that.
[99:07.40]What is going on?
[99:08.22]I didn't... There's two helicopters chasing me.
[99:18.03]Why am I aiming down?
[99:53.29]Don't I fire this?
[99:55.17]Why have I not fired the rocket launcher one time?
[100:01.03]I clearly- didn't I shoot it like five times?
[100:13.57]I do not aim at the helicopter.
[100:18.85]Is this somebody else's replay?
[100:29.71]I want to watch this from the first person perspective.
[100:31.62]You know what I mean?
[100:37.44]We need to see a clear indicator of what happened.
[100:43.25]Can I fast forward?
[100:48.00]No, I can't.
[100:54.30]This is great.
[100:54.94]This is the only camera that's in this room.
[101:02.18]I can't move this anywhere else.
[101:17.55]Alright, alright, we don't have to see it again.
[101:24.08]So, let's see, other modes.
[101:27.10]All levels are a work in progress.
[101:28.32]Dojo, canyon, so there's more.
[101:30.12]Restaurant, garage, tutorial, rooftops.
[101:33.66]Alright, so, lobby, dojo, canyon.
[101:39.90]This is endless mode?
[101:41.18]Does this have a film?
[101:42.38]Does this videotape?
[101:49.04]Oh, I died.
[101:49.62]Okay.
[101:56.02]I think I can just place enemies places, right?
[102:00.52]Yeah, this is just, uh, like a sandbox.
[102:12.30]Alright, well, hold on.
[102:16.56]The, uh, props.
[102:19.36]items no weapons characters um where did the rocket come from
[102:47.24]Characters.
[102:49.02]Suit guy.
[102:52.98]Can I give him some good health?
[103:07.26]The game spawns to go right.
[103:09.54]Does it?
[103:12.31]Spawn health all over me.
[103:18.41]Go right.
[103:18.95]Uh, what do you mean go right?
[103:23.09]Down here?
[103:23.51]I don't think I can go down there.
[103:32.13]North left.
[103:34.44]That's not even real.
[103:37.30]Nah, I think this is like a little sandbox level.
[103:46.10]Nothing over here?
[103:46.68]Nope.
[103:52.18]Okay, let me do one thing.
[103:54.42]Items.
[103:55.56]First aid.
[104:02.32]What's the max health?
[104:05.97]I mean, I think 1100 is pretty good.
[104:08.27]1500, whatever.
[104:09.71]Okay, now characters.
[104:10.43]Okay.
[104:31.07]I don't have any weapons!
[104:42.71]No clip?
[104:49.44]Thank you!
[104:55.10]Oh, fuck.
[104:55.70]I'm dead.
[104:59.91]Alright, is there anything else that I could do?
[105:02.77]Just like the scene, let me look at the scene creator.
[105:05.51]Create scene.
[105:07.61]Oh, Jeremy!
[105:09.29]Okay.
[105:22.02]What do I want, name for your scene?
[105:24.12]Test, let's just test it out.
[105:29.94]mouse three to rotate objects start recordings maximum action editor floor clone mouse to delete move object down x to undo and mouse one to move objects okay editor menu floor five by five
[106:07.08]Okay, uh, what else can I get in here?
[106:09.84]Objects.
[106:10.20]Can I do a... Snow guy.
[106:14.64]Where's helicopter?
[106:20.46]I don't even see the crossbow, really?
[106:28.78]That would've been fun to use.
[106:29.66]Alright, space and move object up.
[106:37.92]Place objects.
[106:39.18]Yeah, you can pick them up and put them down.
[106:43.86]Alright.
[106:44.48]Well, I mean, that's cool if I wanted to... Why am I moving?
[106:51.38]That'd be fun.
[106:51.78]I don't think I want to really sit here and learn it, though.
[106:59.94]So I think that's it for... What about... What's weapon room?
[107:06.69]Ah, now this is what I'm talking about.
[107:07.85]Okay, so you can test it with a crossbow.
[107:13.48]I want to use the crossbow.
[107:22.96]Is it not here?
[107:25.52]Am I stupid?
[107:26.09]I think I might be stupid.
[107:38.51]Wait... No... No... No... Dammit!
[107:52.84]Endless Mode, Act 1.
[107:53.96]What?
[107:54.85]What do you mean?
[107:58.11]What?
[107:59.55]Endless Arena?
[108:03.17]Armory... Endless... Why... This is a weird menu.
[108:05.85]Endless Arena?
[108:11.67]Press to begin endless mode.
[108:13.05]You will not be able to leave.
[108:29.08]This is too bright.
[108:33.24]I thought this was a gun on the wall.
[108:37.67]This hurts my head.
[108:48.48]I need to- I wanna go somewhere else.
[108:51.64]I can't- I can't look at this.
[108:57.91]Other modes.
[108:59.55]Dusk.
[109:00.01]Everyone was saying do Dusk.
[109:01.05]Let's go AK.
[109:10.38]Okay, 30 is 60.
[109:11.74]Crossbow!
[109:12.34]Nice!
[109:12.76]Finally!
[109:17.77]It's got a red dot.
[109:18.69]You got it.
[109:19.11]It's going to use the crossbow.
[109:21.63]Press to begin endless mode.
[109:22.83]Alright, let's go.
[109:32.87]Explain to me what is going on right now.
[109:37.86]Are those my arrows?
[109:40.34]I'm confused.
[109:45.70]These...
[109:50.45]Alright.
[110:00.01]I can't... I can't... Fuck.
[110:06.89]Let's try this again.
[110:07.81]Alright, let's go.
[110:20.34]Current wave.
[110:25.19]Here it comes.
[110:25.67]How's that not hitting you?
[110:40.68]Oh, fuck!
[110:41.28]It did hit you!
[110:53.16]get in the house
[111:18.46]Alright, wave 2.
[111:32.73]I gotta- I said stay in the house.
[111:52.20]I did a better job than you.
[112:04.29]Shit, I'm gonna die.
[112:05.17]I'm dead.
[112:09.97]Damn it.
[112:11.54]Well, that's cool.
[112:23.30]I wish it recorded this.
[112:24.96]Yeah.
[112:27.74]Alright, any other modes?
[112:29.74]Endless mode, the cutting room floor.
[112:34.38]What does that mean?
[112:35.74]Endless mode, the cutting room floor?
[112:37.06]I'm not quite sure what this does.
[112:47.92]This is a weird view.
[112:54.53]Okay.
[113:22.47]Out of ammo.
[113:25.01]Didn't say what it was.
[113:25.71]Alright, well this is another level.
[113:31.21]It's like a different area.
[113:32.83]Oh!
[113:36.69]Get out of the way!
[113:59.64]Oh, you're playing old levels that are there.
[114:01.74]Okay, these are not official levels anymore.
[114:04.86]Okay, I get you.
[114:05.50]So this is like the first pass of this rooftop level.
[114:11.25]Alright, that's cool though.
[114:12.29]You can still play them.
[114:16.53]Alright, I'm gonna pee my pants.
[114:18.57]I drank a large coffee.
[114:29.54]Why do I always say that?
[114:30.32]Because it's true.
[114:31.34]I would pee my pants if I wasn't smart.
[114:40.64]Where's the exit?
[114:41.88]Somewhere over here?
[114:43.94]Where am I going?
[114:48.43]Am I missing something?
[115:04.12]The TV!
[115:04.92]Look at the TV!
[115:18.57]They give you a lot of those.
[115:19.53]Alright, we'll move on.
[115:26.91]What did I say in the very beginning of the stream?
[115:28.29]That there was probably less than a couple hours of content?
[115:30.24]So far?
[115:32.48]Yeah.
[115:32.88]That's really fun, though.
[115:34.10]It is.
[115:35.00]I love when games add a little something interesting.
[115:40.80]Without that movie mode, I think the movie mode makes it huge.
[115:45.80]And if they continue to develop this and add more stuff and add more camera controls, I think it would be really, really fun.
[116:00.75]Hold it.
[116:01.13]Yeah, okay.
[116:02.39]Alright.
[116:03.97]So what we're going to do now, I'm going to go pee.
[116:05.97]I'm going to come back.
[116:07.89]And I'm going to play a little bit of Rollercoaster Tycoon 2.
[116:15.54]That's the plan.
[116:18.72]But no, that was fun.
[116:20.22]That was absolutely fun, funny, and worth playing.
[116:23.66]So I'll be right back.
[116:25.30]We'll change games.
[116:26.24]See you guys in a minute.
