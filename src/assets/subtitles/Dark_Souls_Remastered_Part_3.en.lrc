[00:03.05]Hey now, you're an all-star.
[00:04.87]Get your game on.
[00:06.04]Get slayed.
[00:08.68]Hey now.
[00:10.10]Now you're in the backseat.
[00:12.26]Get your flame on.
[00:13.72]Get paid.
[00:19.91]And everyone just got sorted into Slytherin.
[00:27.41]Only shooting stars.
[00:36.67]Hey, how are you?
[00:47.02]Good, good.
[00:50.40]I'm good.
[00:53.37]You gonna haha me?
[00:54.13]This is the first five seconds of a stream.
[00:55.89]I'm allowed to do something stupid.
[00:58.57]There's nobody even here.
[01:01.29]Don't you know that the first 45 seconds and the last 45 seconds of every stream I do, it's just, I get to just pretend like I'm looking in the mirror.
[01:10.40]I sang that song in the mirror like an hour ago.
[01:13.90]I was just testing it on you guys to see if you liked it.
[01:15.50]Get this microphone over here.
[01:17.94]Why is it out there?
[01:23.41]Anyways, yep.
[01:24.01]Hi.
[01:24.31]You know what's happening.
[01:25.59]I don't even need to tell you what we're playing because you already know.
[01:32.98]Can't do anything stupid for the rest of the stream.
[01:36.95]Well, all right, I'll try.
[01:39.37]I don't have much of an intro today.
[01:48.91]We're just more Dark Souls.
[01:51.19]Sen's Fortress.
[01:53.57]Trying to get through it.
[01:56.89]I bet you I fall off.
[01:58.58]Hey, hey guys.
[02:03.46]Eventually he falls off.
[02:05.58]Yeah, you'd be right.
[02:10.91]Move this out of the way.
[02:11.81]We don't even need it anymore.
[02:20.10]Please calm down.
[02:21.22]I can't.
[02:21.66]I'm like in a good mood right now.
[02:23.24]Come on.
[02:25.24]Don't you think it's fairly rare with all these random internet and technical problems that I start a stream and I'm not like, oh, there it goes.
[02:31.28]Oh, there it goes.
[02:37.13]I'm in a good mood today.
[02:42.92]He's high.
[02:45.04]No, I'm not.
[02:47.56]Cool.
[02:48.04]Here we go.
[02:49.52]I just killed the blacksmith.
[02:50.46]Oops.
[02:52.94]You guys can hear this, right?
[02:53.64]Yeah, you can.
[02:55.85]Too much CVD oil?
[02:59.21]How did you know that?
[03:01.03]Ah, shit.
[03:01.53]Hold on.
[03:01.79]I gotta blow this.
[03:02.53]It's a little too loud for me.
[03:07.09]It's just a little too loud for me.
[03:09.59]Just a little bit.
[03:13.58]That should be good.
[03:17.36]Hey, much better for me.
[03:18.98]Much better.
[03:22.12]I'm fat rolling?
[03:22.80]I am not fat rolling.
[03:27.57]Who's ready for 150 plus deaths?
[03:31.45]Um, not me.
[03:37.40]no I don't smoke weed guys I don't I do not smoke marijuana mid rolling well that's because I'm playing a big fat guy I am fat rolling uh is it fat rolling when you jump and land on your back you slam down and pancake
[04:02.06]It doesn't even matter.
[04:02.90]Oops.
[04:03.20]Well, I already forgot that was here.
[04:05.09]You know what?
[04:05.37]Let's just turn.
[04:06.01]Okay, we're going to turn.
[04:06.99]That one didn't count because I forgot.
[04:11.29]That one doesn't count because I forgot that was there.
[04:13.11]So it doesn't count as a death.
[04:20.04]Oh, it's a cool place.
[04:21.28]And after it gets colder.
[04:27.78]This is a dude no death run.
[04:29.34]Do you think I have the patience to attempt something like that?
[04:35.00]I didn't even get the shortcut either.
[04:36.22]Alright, let's be careful.
[04:37.76]There's the two snakes.
[04:38.43]We're going to run by them.
[04:45.39]Up here.
[04:45.73]Yep, yep, yep.
[04:46.39]This is the part where the two pendulums...
[04:53.74]Sneak by that.
[04:55.70]And here comes Mr. Snake 1.
[04:56.94]Let's try to get him in one swing.
[05:03.21]Perfect.
[05:05.95]I hope I remember the bonfire location.
[05:07.51]I didn't even find it.
[05:08.31]I have no idea where it is.
[05:11.37]I didn't even see it.
[05:15.05]Alright, this one.
[05:18.87]Oh, hold on.
[05:19.71]I'm not ready.
[05:22.98]I'm not ready.
[05:24.17]I'll be ready now.
[05:26.31]Oh, God!
[05:27.87]I'm not ready.
[05:28.37]I gotta warm up a little bit first.
[05:29.55]I need to, like, I need to warm up a little.
[05:37.12]I have to, like... I'm way too fucking happy and high-strung right now.
[05:40.88]I have to, like, slow down.
[05:52.86]I'm not prepared to play Dark Souls right now.
[05:54.77]I'm prepared to sing shitty versions of Smash Mouth.
[06:00.13]That's what I'm prepared to do.
[06:08.18]God, I bet you he falls off.
[06:10.48]Alright, here we go.
[06:12.30]I gotta move around.
[06:13.72]What the hell?
[06:15.78]They followed me in.
[06:17.81]No, wait, I wasn't ready.
[06:19.83]This is not supposed to be happening right now.
[06:21.63]Why is this collapsing?
[06:23.92]I didn't want to do that either.
[06:28.42]Why is this fucking collapsing?
[06:30.96]It's collapsing.
[06:32.66]They gotta get hit by the saw.
[06:35.10]Alright, I'm fine.
[06:36.56]How are they going through it?
[06:37.76]How are they going through this?
[06:40.87]How did you get through that better than I can?
[06:43.55]That's unbelievable.
[06:44.75]This is unbelievable.
[06:45.85]How did he get through?
[06:47.53]They both got through.
[06:50.78]And then I die and they fall off.
[07:00.16]Okay, well, last night, I didn't mess this up one time.
[07:04.80]So here, like...
[07:07.24]you wonder how now this is how you get older and the media mandates the pickles how long have I been live I literally just started all right I have to start like caring and paying attention let's try that see if that works oh my god
[07:37.04]Oh my god!
[07:52.87]Windows Update is back.
[07:57.53]Windows Update's back!
[08:06.94]I did a workaround.
[08:07.70]There's no end.
[08:19.62]Alright, I got it out of my system.
[08:21.22]Let's, like, play Dark Souls now.
[08:24.25]I'm actually glad that just happened so I could tell it to leave me alone.
[08:29.39]Well, that's not what I wanted to do.
[08:35.61]I'll show it for you.
[08:40.91]Okay, one more for you.
[08:44.89]Okay.
[08:53.43]Back to reality.
[08:55.23]Also, something else weird is going on.
[08:56.61]Once I get through this, I'll ask it.
[09:00.01]Does anybody else... I don't know if it's the chair I'm in right now, but hold on.
[09:05.11]Let me just not fuck this up.
[09:12.09]No, I wanted to do the forward.
[09:13.31]That's really annoying.
[09:18.75]I wish you had to hold it to do that.
[09:20.15]Because I want to do... Lunging attacks are going to be annoying for me to do here.
[09:24.76]So my chair... The way that my elbows are sitting down on my chair... I'm getting red, irritated skin on my elbows.
[09:35.03]The way that my elbows are just pressing into this chair.
[09:37.55]Do I need a new chair?
[09:38.31]No.
[09:44.35]First try.
[09:46.95]Not quite.
[09:49.43]I get a beat.
[09:49.83]Hold on.
[09:52.56]That does happen.
[09:53.18]That's fucking annoying.
[10:02.52]Wait for the next pass here.
[10:03.66]He's going to cast a bolt.
[10:05.48]Okay, and now we... Please don't.
[10:09.11]Please don't.
[10:12.51]Okay, I'm fine.
[10:13.53]Alright, back to where we kind of were.
[10:15.62]I gotta go through the boulder area again.
[10:17.34]Alright, this is this.
[10:23.74]Yeah, the snake.
[10:26.74]Wait, what's going on?
[10:29.21]Oh, wait a minute.
[10:29.57]Is it... Oh, wait a second.
[10:31.09]Okay.
[10:32.07]It's like remembering that I did this.
[10:35.15]This is fucking confusing me so much here.
[10:37.67]Is that boulder gonna come down?
[10:38.75]No, it's not.
[10:41.23]This guy never came back.
[10:42.33]Like, honestly, this is the first time I've seen this guy.
[10:43.81]Because this guy sleeps on the fucking wall.
[10:46.11]Here's the boulder.
[10:50.46]We knocked that down, and now he comes after us.
[10:54.22]Okay, does it keep going?
[10:55.10]Let me just see this.
[10:56.16]Yeah, that goes all the way down.
[10:58.06]Alright, so the boulder doesn't come over here.
[10:59.36]Uh... Ziggward is no longer with us.
[11:07.29]Clean your chair?
[11:09.75]What do you mean clean your chair?
[11:14.41]Alright, hold on.
[11:15.01]I gotta be careful.
[11:19.40]Get fucked.
[11:20.96]Get fucked.
[11:24.54]Can he step on that and have it activate?
[11:29.54]Apparently not.
[11:36.65]Oh, god damn it.
[11:47.04]I will say, this weapon is really good, but it makes you so vulnerable.
[11:54.94]I need to kindle this bonfire.
[11:57.14]Seriously.
[12:01.58]The amount of traps and fucked up shit that's in here, I really need to kindle the bonfire.
[12:05.10]I'm going to be in a lot of trouble.
[12:12.76]He's too high for Dark Souls.
[12:15.72]Oh!
[12:18.22]Didn't I turn this thing?
[12:22.18]I thought I turned it.
[12:28.38]What the fuck?
[12:31.26]I thought I already did this.
[12:45.45]Same thing fucking happened.
[12:46.21]I thought I turned it around.
[12:49.01]Why am I doing... I'm so fucked.
[12:54.85]I really thought I dumped it over here.
[13:01.71]Well, it's not going that way.
[13:02.95]I wonder if I should go over that way.
[13:07.31]I'm in so much trouble.
[13:12.33]Yeah, please remind me to kindle the bonfire.
[13:19.94]Is there anything else down here?
[13:21.42]I feel like I can go because I can move here now.
[13:23.14]There's something I should probably grab or... Anything?
[13:27.80]Okay, I opened this door.
[13:35.94]Right?
[13:36.28]Am I going the right way?
[13:37.72]I have no idea where the fuck I'm going right now.
[13:46.61]You couldn't pay me to tell you where to go.
[13:48.97]Oh my god.
[14:01.80]Keep doing that walk in the corridor You're in the worst possible spot right now, man Don't keep throwing firebolts down of course he's look at that little tiny leave he's left-handed now when did anybody die?
[14:19.55]Why did you become right-handed?
[14:24.85]I'm so screwed
[14:27.73]Look at how, there's no place to walk over there.
[14:30.83]I gotta take one of those things that I have.
[14:32.41]I'll take a humanity.
[14:34.19]It's worth it.
[14:37.37]Okay, a humanity is going to heal me, right?
[14:42.02]That's gonna happen, isn't it?
[14:48.77]Oh, thank god.
[14:57.49]Oh, internet's dying, by the way.
[14:59.73]Just to be curious.
[15:07.51]Oh, well.
[15:08.85]Literally moving to Vegas in like 30 days.
[15:11.16]So, just, we have to deal with it.
[15:12.72]There's nothing I can do.
[15:13.38]Have to deal with it.
[15:14.08]We have to deal with it.
[15:16.56]I'm going to look at places and potentially signing papers in like 7 days.
[15:20.54]So, it's happening as fast as I possibly can make it happen.
[15:26.54]Oh, well.
[15:37.96]Oh yeah, I'm expediting the process to literally... I don't even care if I lose money.
[15:44.30]I'm getting out of here as fast as I can.
[15:54.41]Well, that's unfortunate.
[15:57.55]That's unfortunate.
[16:04.13]It's such an interesting predicament to be in, though.
[16:05.83]That's the thing, right?
[16:06.87]So last night... How long was the stream yesterday?
[16:09.74]Maybe seven and a half hours?
[16:12.44]And we're talking within a 24-hour period, right?
[16:16.66]24 hours ago, I was live for seven straight hours without a single problem.
[16:21.69]And now, like, 24 hours later, it's awful.
[16:23.05]I don't know.
[16:33.34]Seven straight hours of no problems.
[16:40.85]How can one day?
[16:42.19]That's what I don't... It doesn't make any sense.
[16:45.75]There's no logical sense to any of the problems that I have.
[16:49.44]Seriously.
[16:52.32]Well.
[16:58.07]I need to look around.
[16:58.83]I already got the item here.
[17:15.12]Maybe this serves as a Comcast to heaven.
[17:16.96]I'm so glad to never deal with this piece of garbage company ever again.
[17:22.93]Like, if I see on the news that the Comcast CEO lost everything, and he's like a homeless guy, I'm gonna laugh.
[17:33.12]Like, if I hear that Comcast goes bankrupt, I'm going to laugh at the hardest I've ever laughed in my life.
[17:46.70]I don't know.
[17:47.28]Can I go this way?
[17:54.36]Well, uh... I'm gonna go down.
[17:58.10]I don't even know what I'm... I'm just, like, not even paying attention anymore, unfortunately.
[18:04.25]This is where I was before.
[18:05.09]This is the mimic chest.
[18:13.16]And this is the elevator.
[18:14.76]The bonfire is, like, here somewhere.
[18:16.70]I have no idea where it is, though, or where the hell I'm going.
[18:23.21]I think I'm... I think I am supposed to go this way.
[18:28.48]This is where I was before.
[18:31.34]Open the... Kill the mimic.
[18:38.29]Am I sure it's the internet?
[18:39.15]Yeah, I can see my upload speed going down to, like, 0.5.
[18:44.32]Up.
[18:44.62]When I'm paying for, like, 20.
[18:45.64]25.
[18:45.66]Uh...
[19:26.65]It's funny, we had a long conversation about this shit last night.
[19:32.81]And... Like, here we are again.
[19:47.56]Now I'm in a more appropriate mood to play Dark Souls.
[19:50.06]I need to go back up here, I think.
[19:54.37]This is not... No, this ain't cool.
[19:56.71]I want to enjoy this with you guys and play this and have fun.
[19:59.96]I don't want to have one out of every fucking eight frames drop.
[20:03.62]That's not cool.
[20:04.22]I don't want to do that.
[20:07.80]Oh, man.
[20:08.31]This is... I got like a... I'm wearing...
[20:15.63]I'm wearing, like, um... Okay, you know when... I don't know.
[20:19.54]Am I thinking of a movie or, like, a TV show or something?
[20:22.14]There's a huge, strong man.
[20:25.28]And they, like, put a bunch of weights on him to make him easier to fight.
[20:28.94]Did that happen in Rocky?
[20:33.01]I got weights all over me that I can't get rid of until I leave.
[20:47.92]That was in Dragon Ball Z?
[20:50.14]Yeah.
[20:50.60]Okay.
[20:50.96]So, like... I wish... Whatever.
[20:58.26]I really hate having, like, two... Oh, so... And I just... I think I just awoke the mimic.
[21:03.33]No, I didn't.
[21:09.13]I'm just gonna attack this and just be annoyed, so let's just kill this thing.
[21:26.10]Okay.
[21:26.50]Well, I killed the mimic.
[21:29.14]And I got the lightning spear.
[21:30.22]That sounds pretty cool.
[21:32.02]I wish you guys could see it.
[21:46.17]Let me just get to an area where I can get out of here.
[21:48.65]I can't even focus right now.
[21:51.11]This thing has spikes on it.
[21:51.89]Where do I go?
[21:52.31]Where do I roll to?
[21:52.89]Can I duck?
[21:59.51]It's right there, okay.
[22:00.27]Remember that for next time.
[22:07.43]Get out, get out, get out!
[22:09.05]Get out of there!
[22:10.59]Okay.
[22:17.44]Where is... I need to go this way... I need to go back up.
[22:24.87]Where's that boulder?
[22:27.45]There's a lever to push the boulder.
[22:35.54]I don't know where the fuck I'm going right now.
[22:37.40]I'm just so far removed right now.
[22:42.06]Like, seriously.
[22:43.98]Okay, there it is.
[22:44.62]It's around here.
[22:45.32]Can I go there this way?
[22:46.92]Is there, like, a place I can go to touch that?
[22:59.91]I'm trying to think of, like, where is that room with the lever to push the
[23:18.06]I'm, like, holding in.
[23:20.70]Like... Like, a true meltdown.
[23:26.36]A real meltdown.
[23:28.07]I am holding in, like, an actual, no joking around, meltdown right now.
[23:34.53]Like, I am suppressing it.
[23:36.97]It's taking every ounce that I have in my body to keep it there.
[23:42.36]And then something's gonna shoot at me and kill me.
[23:45.72]From where?
[23:46.14]What direction?
[23:56.66]Is this gonna kill me if it kills me I'm gonna be so sad It's gonna shoot at me from here.
[24:01.24]Can I jump can I jump it?
[24:02.22]I'm gonna try to jump this Wowie What's that what's that thing okay more the spikes I was already wasn't I already here I
[24:23.76]I was already here, wasn't I?
[24:25.02]No, there's a guy over there.
[24:26.26]Holy shit.
[24:32.78]Oh my god, really?
[24:35.10]What's the timing on this?
[24:37.04]And there's one of those snake heads over there.
[24:38.50]I'm gonna take another humanity.
[24:51.64]Okay, so I think I have to just go, go, run, run, run, run.
[24:54.66]Where's the stopping point?
[24:56.53]Is there even one?
[24:58.11]I don't think there is.
[24:58.69]Okay, we're good.
[25:10.55]Not today.
[25:10.97]There's a way to go over there.
[25:16.15]That's a drop though.
[25:17.23]I don't think I want to do that.
[25:19.09]Not yet at least.
[25:21.66]Lightning dragon.
[25:23.20]What about over here?
[25:30.10]Item.
[25:30.48]What's going on?
[25:30.96]I hear something.
[25:38.11]Yeah, I'm just trying to get to the bonfire so I can stop the stream.
[25:44.05]Titanite shard.
[25:45.97]Well, he's coming down here anyways.
[25:54.14]Stream's getting better.
[25:54.95]I just, it's so stupid that I have to worry about this every fucking day.
[26:02.77]It's so dumb.
[26:05.47]It's so ridiculous that I'm paying for a business internet.
[26:14.12]And I can't use it for its intended purpose.
[26:18.33]It doesn't make any sense.
[26:19.41]That should be illegal.
[26:21.01]You know what I mean?
[26:21.43]You understand?
[26:22.31]This should be against the fucking law.
[26:25.93]I don't understand how this is okay.
[26:28.53]Ever.
[26:29.51]In any service.
[26:30.61]Or any business.
[26:37.92]Oh my god, this is scary.
[26:39.38]I don't know if I can do this yet.
[26:40.58]Is there another place to go?
[26:42.30]That's so scary.
[26:46.20]That's such a tiny little thing to walk on.
[26:52.34]No, this is just a death drop.
[26:54.89]I have to do it.
[26:57.77]Just lower the bitrate.
[27:02.57]That's the thing, it's... Lowering the bitrate.
[27:07.00]I already did.
[27:07.66]I went from like 5,000 to like 4,500 and then down to 4,000.
[27:09.16]I really don't want to drop my bitrate to like 2,000 or 3,000.
[27:11.88]It's going to look awful.
[27:20.90]And my kilobytes a second here are going down to like 1.
[27:27.44]Sometimes it's hitting like 500.
[27:28.84]It's not gonna help.
[27:35.58]Okay.
[27:40.90]Holy shit.
[27:44.87]Alright, I ain't dealing with this guy.
[27:47.13]I'm throwing bombs at this guy until he's dead.
[27:49.01]This guy will blow everything for me.
[27:52.57]I don't need these anymore.
[27:53.45]Alright, Fireball.
[27:55.73]Oh, I got something to give.
[27:59.91]$50.
[28:00.11]$50.
[28:00.13]$50 from PanMan92.
[28:01.38]Thanks for the $50, man.
[28:04.14]I increased the bitrate.
[28:07.66]I wish it was that easy.
[28:09.98]Thank you, dude, for the $50.
[28:10.76]That's very kind of you.
[28:21.53]You...
[28:26.53]Oh shit.
[28:29.33]Oh no.
[28:30.05]Alright, I gotta throw one of these big ones at him.
[28:37.37]It's worth it.
[28:37.77]He's dead?
[28:45.49]Okay.
[28:47.57]It's worth it.
[28:48.13]That was worth doing.
[28:48.83]Are there any more of those guys?
[28:56.40]peruse this whole thing.
[29:00.96]Any more guys throwing lightning out windows?
[29:04.95]Why is this frame so laggy?
[29:06.41]Because Comcast is the worst company voted like a hundred times.
[29:12.51]A hundred years in a row.
[29:14.09]Even before the invention of the car, Comcast was the worst rated company in history.
[29:20.42]I'm going to get trolled here.
[29:21.36]I know it.
[29:27.28]Just got to go.
[29:31.08]Oh, that was close.
[29:35.26]Should have used the pyromancy.
[29:36.78]Okay, I held down the block.
[29:40.56]I'm fine.
[29:40.86]All right.
[29:43.12]Boss there?
[29:45.31]What else is here?
[29:45.91]Imagine if I didn't hold block.
[29:57.76]Give me the bonfire.
[29:58.56]Please.
[30:00.00]Please give me a bonfire.
[30:02.62]I deserve it.
[30:05.10]It's not here.
[30:05.68]Come on.
[30:09.72]I feel like I want to take another humanity here.
[30:12.06]In fact, I am.
[30:14.37]Can you hit the same pressure plate twice?
[30:19.81]Watch out for that one.
[30:20.51]I see that one.
[30:28.93]I got it.
[30:29.31]Okay.
[30:34.69]Bonfire.
[30:39.96]What's he doing?
[30:40.90]What's he doing?
[30:42.66]It's Atlas.
[30:43.44]It's just Atlas.
[30:44.04]He's okay.
[30:44.34]He's friendly.
[30:44.78]He's holding up the goddamn earth for us.
[30:47.86]I'm taking a humanity.
[30:52.97]I am.
[30:53.33]I just am.
[30:54.53]I can't fuck around here.
[30:55.79]I don't care if I'm wasting it.
[31:03.69]All I need is to get backstabbed one time by some random enemy and it's over.
[31:06.93]That guy's not going to throw those rocks at me, right?
[31:19.86]I'm up here.
[31:26.96]He's throwing.
[31:28.07]Who threw that?
[31:29.59]He did.
[31:30.73]He threw it.
[31:32.11]Don't get the item yet.
[31:32.79]He's going to throw another one.
[31:35.06]Oh my god, where is it?
[31:35.74]Oh my god, I'm so scared.
[31:39.77]I need the bonfire.
[31:40.99]I can't go anywhere.
[31:52.07]I'm stun-locked forever.
[32:13.49]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[32:14.67]Jump off the ledge?
[32:15.49]What do you mean?
[32:16.44]I'm not gonna get trolled here, guys.
[32:19.48]If I jump off that ledge, it's fine?
[32:21.26]I'm gonna listen!
[32:24.10]I'm gonna listen!
[32:24.70]I'm gonna listen!
[32:25.32]I'm gonna listen to you!
[32:27.94]Oh, thank god I listened!
[32:33.63]Holy shit, I thought you guys killed me.
[32:40.03]Oh...
[32:45.35]I thought that was like a... You guys are just trying to get me to do something dumb.
[32:48.73]Thank God for you.
[32:49.91]Thank God you guys existed.
[32:50.83]I wouldn't run up the stairs.
[32:54.89]But I don't know how much more I can do this.
[33:02.78]You thought I was going to do a full jump?
[33:05.58]Oh my God.
[33:06.56]I would have lost my mind.
[33:13.41]I'm going to kindle this fire.
[33:19.05]So wait.
[33:21.81]No, I can't Kindle while hollowed.
[33:23.11]That sucks.
[33:30.69]Just play flat.
[33:31.61]Well, I think the stream died.
[33:36.45]Are we 100% dead?
[33:37.68]Yeah, we are going to zero here, guys.
[33:51.66]We are going to zero.
[34:07.29]I'm going to just let it sit here for a second.
[34:14.15]Well, we were just at zero bitrate for at least 10 seconds there.
[34:25.23]This is just audio.
[34:30.23]The risk of meltdown.
[34:38.60]I'm stuck in a goddamn cocoon right now.
[34:41.94]This move to Las Vegas, guys, is the germ of Butterfly.
[34:46.28]I'm gonna turn into a fucking... I'm gonna have the most big, beautiful fucking blue and teal and magenta wings you've ever seen.
[34:54.99]And they're going to be huge wings.
[34:59.64]Another $50.
[35:04.64]Thank you for the $50.
[35:09.77]By Dr. Low Note, thanks for the $50.
[35:12.53]And they say, hey, thank you for trying to stream, Derma.
[35:17.23]I had dinner plans with my long-term girlfriend tonight, but we broke up.
[35:22.40]So I wanted to cheer up by watching you.
[35:24.38]Sorry for Comcast.
[35:25.40]Hope this will help.
[35:28.75]Hopefully you can still hear me, Dr. Low Note, because we look to be cutting out every now and then.
[35:36.57]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[35:38.63]And you came here for a fun stream where we hang out and play Dark Souls and have some fun?
[35:47.71]I'm sorry, that's not what you're getting.
[35:53.27]Keep your chin up.
[35:56.19]That's always rough, especially long term.
[36:00.81]I wish you the best, man, for real.
[36:08.92]When we started off, I was singing today.
[36:19.78]That means I was in a good mood.
[36:30.36]Somebody said Las Vegas has bad internet.
[36:33.82]Well, not when you are specifically looking in your specific criteria for moving into a place is checkbox, does this property have fiber internet?
[36:47.61]Is what the criteria is.
[36:52.03]God damn it.
[37:01.47]We're having fun.
[37:02.11]Well, I hope you are.
[37:03.23]But we can't have fun if I can't physically broadcast with an upload to the internet.
[37:12.59]The stream is such an emotional rollercoaster.
[37:14.81]I just want to fucking stream.
[37:16.79]Like, it's so hard to do that.
[37:22.53]I had like a fucking... I had like a career-ending meltdown last night.
[37:28.42]about technical problems and then the next day it's like it's like somebody's watching with a bunch of computer screens like what are we gonna do today let's give him the internet problems today enter downloading executing meltdown
[37:59.92]Again, I just have to apologize.
[38:01.62]And I know it's not my fault.
[38:06.87]I wish there was something I could do.
[38:10.47]And it's it's gotten to a point where yes, like I'm moving across the country To try to make these streams better that's number one is more resources for hopefully more interesting projects and better location and internet wise it's It's not this is not cool I
[38:36.86]And I am actually, I'm surprised that, and happy, I guess, that there are this many people that watch this stream and support this stream even through the last, like, five to six months of these, like, catastrophic issues.
[38:52.41]So, thank you for continuing to watch and support this stream.
[38:58.68]Even though sometimes you just can't even fucking watch it.
[39:01.16]Like, I'm sorry.
[39:04.52]Stream at one bit rate.
[39:05.64]I wonder what it would even... What would it even look like?
[39:07.48]You know, I'm like... I'm keen to the idea of just not giving a fuck right now and streaming at like 200 kilobytes.
[39:15.03]That's gonna be so... But I'm gonna give people notifications for that and I don't wanna... I don't know if I wanna fuck with people like that right now.
[39:28.86]Hey, welcome to the 40 minute stream.
[39:37.18]It's gonna be no, but I don't want to play Dark Souls I want to experience this game for the first time on stream and I don't want it to be I Don't want to there are things that I don't know what's gonna happen There are interesting scenarios that I want you guys to feel to see it's blind.
[39:52.36]I want to have fun with it and Having fun with it is not me streaming it at like a hundred K up.
[39:58.10]Oh
[40:03.83]Let me see.
[40:04.27]Can I, like, just do it on the fly?
[40:05.55]I wonder.
[40:06.21]The stream... I think the stream has to turn off.
[40:10.59]Do just GeoGuessr.
[40:13.95]GeoGuessr even still is not gonna... Let me just see.
[40:24.82]Let me... The game is saved.
[40:27.10]Hold on.
[40:27.44]I'm gonna see if we can do anything else for the time being.
[40:31.87]I might just do a fucking like face cam.
[40:33.85]Just be as scared and angry.
[40:36.72]Scared and angry face cam stream incoming.
