[00:06.35]Hey.
[00:07.83]How are you?
[00:10.01]Welcome to the stream.
[00:11.17]Good afternoon.
[00:15.65]Sorry, I was a little tied up.
[00:19.33]Available now.
[00:23.28]Today, we're going to be playing... Nancy Drew.
[00:35.03]Midnight in Salem.
[00:38.74]You're probably wondering what's the bet that I lost.
[00:42.70]Uh... One guy strikes again.
[00:47.40]And this is actually one guy from yesterday, or the day before.
[00:52.96]So... Somebody said this, and it's just, hey, do Nancy Drew.
[00:59.03]I would love it.
[01:00.91]I'm like, oh, why would I fucking ever do this?
[01:03.55]And the two days went by, or day went by, and I slept on it, and I woke up, and I'm like...
[01:09.10]Yeah, okay.
[01:11.76]I mean, there are, let me be fair, there were at least another, like, 30 or 40 one guys in the game.
[01:18.14]Uh, not in the game.
[01:19.12]In the chat before the stream started that also said this is a good idea.
[01:24.33]Why did you pick the worst Nancy Drew?
[01:26.21]This one just released!
[01:28.53]This one just came out!
[01:29.65]This is a brand new one.
[01:31.09]This is the one that came out literally two days ago.
[01:34.01]This one sucks.
[01:38.62]You guys act like I don't have at least three, four to ten Nancy Drew games on backup, ready to go.
[01:47.81]This one sucks ass.
[01:52.13]This one sucks ass.
[01:53.57]That person was not happy about it.
[01:56.49]There's 32.
[01:57.72]There's as many Nancy Drew games as I've had birthdays.
[02:02.36]Just play them all.
[02:04.20]That's not going to happen.
[02:06.69]It would have to take something extreme from me.
[02:10.24]I would have to play for 20 minutes in this and go, yep, we're doing all of them.
[02:17.02]Play them all.
[02:17.82]Play them all.
[02:21.23]Extreme.
[02:26.61]Money stream to force Jerma to play them all.
[02:31.21]No, that would not work.
[02:32.43]I'm going to tell you right now, those of you that are like, oh yeah, let's money stream and he'll do it.
[02:37.33]I'm not going to do it.
[02:39.37]So if you do a money stream, just be aware that is not going to do anything.
[02:45.98]It's not going to do anything.
[02:48.28]It's not going to make me play Nancy Drew 1 for 32.
[02:55.12]Just make sure you're aware of that.
[02:58.41]But this continues of our non-canon week, and what that means is every stream you've seen this week didn't happen.
[03:05.98]None of these are canon.
[03:07.20]They're all in the extended universe.
[03:15.42]So, knowing that, it's like, fuck it, let's play Nancy Drew, Midnight Insane.
[03:21.79]You know?
[03:22.83]Fuck it.
[03:27.87]Didn't miss anything canon?
[03:28.83]No, not yet.
[03:31.41]So this is the one that came out two days ago.
[03:35.35]And here's the thing about this.
[03:37.35]I have never played any, a single second of Nancy Drew.
[03:43.24]So this is all new to me.
[03:46.14]I haven't played any... One time in college...
[03:50.32]Nancy Drew 2.
[03:52.20]I do remember friends of mine were actually playing it in the dorm rooms.
[03:56.28]They had a hookup where they could do more than three or four computers together.
[04:02.31]I got to see it.
[04:03.25]I sat down.
[04:03.97]I did a little bit of a puzzle for like two minutes.
[04:05.79]I was like, alright, whatever.
[04:07.27]And there's a lot of these.
[04:07.87]I know this is a really, really established franchise, but I've never done it.
[04:15.69]And this is a scary one.
[04:16.89]Somebody's house is burning down.
[04:19.16]So I'm going to give $50.
[04:20.60]It's not going to do anything.
[04:21.36]It's not going to do anything.
[04:23.94]Okay, let's put a bracket here.
[04:26.50]Thanks for the $5,000.
[04:27.38]It's not going to do anything.
[04:30.04]Thank you.
[04:32.08]No, 5,000 bits.
[04:34.10]If you tell me to play Nancy Drew 4 because it's your favorite one, I'm not going to play it.
[04:38.68]Did someone say money stream?
[04:39.98]Also heard you were offering private streams for $5,000 in McDonald's gift cards.
[04:44.38]I'll get on that.
[04:45.50]But this is non-canon.
[04:46.36]This whole week is not canon, so it's not real.
[04:50.41]Something that you should know about Nancy Drew, Midnight in Salem, which is actually very, very interesting.
[04:55.78]There are, like, FPS game graphics settings in this game.
[05:03.26]Real-time reflections, anti-aliasing, post-process, shadow, shadow quality.
[05:09.22]There are more options in here than I've seen in a lot of actual FPS releases.
[05:17.96]Right?
[05:18.50]Look at this.
[05:20.78]They weren't fucking around.
[05:23.70]Non-descript civilian thanks to the five community subs.
[05:28.62]This has more options than Halo Reach.
[05:30.98]No, it doesn't.
[05:34.80]They have all these options, but it still has Unity Grass.
[05:44.45]Well, just let's give it... Just let's give it a little bit, okay?
[05:51.90]Unity.
[05:55.60]Yeah, alright, here we go.
[05:59.78]New game.
[06:02.09]Difficulty.
[06:02.97]Amateur Sloth.
[06:05.19]Master Sloth.
[06:07.95]A sleuth... I feel... Okay, remember, this is a game for...
[06:14.49]This is a game for, like, 15-year-olds or something.
[06:18.71]This is like a 12-year-old game, right?
[06:20.95]So, an amateur... An amateur 12-year-old versus a master 12-year-old.
[06:26.58]I think this is like, for an adult like me, this is like... No, I... I have to do master.
[06:39.10]This is a kid's game.
[06:44.35]British accent, British accent, British... Fuck.
[06:45.97]Get an old relic.
[06:46.93]That's fucking terrifying.
[07:11.17]You don't want to go here.
[07:12.05]Oh, the place is supposed to be haunted.
[07:14.97]So yeah, I might get killed in here.
[07:17.69]I might get fucking eaten by a demon, but oh, I'm looking forward to the scares.
[07:20.99]Feels like ages since I was on my last adventure.
[07:28.25]Is it an FPS?
[07:29.57]Where am I?
[07:29.99]Is this my house?
[07:32.01]This house is fucked.
[07:51.47]I just write letters in my fucking crumbling house?
[07:55.59]I haven't been to the grocery store in like fucking years.
[07:58.35]Click to move.
[08:17.51]Oh, no.
[08:18.43]It's a cli- What is this tablet version?
[08:21.61]Hey, it's like, hey, just to let you know, get this on your iPad.
[08:26.42]It's probably better.
[08:27.28]Oh, that was easy.
[08:33.22]That's not a good view.
[08:38.96]That's a terrible view.
[08:41.20]It's just trees.
[08:44.16]I mean, I guess that the mountain's kind of cool.
[08:47.61]Click on the screen edges to turn.
[08:49.13]Yeah.
[08:49.39]Okay.
[08:54.23]What should I... What the fuck?
[08:55.65]What is going on in here?
[08:57.97]Is this Judge Sewell's desk?
[09:00.47]Ah, yes, yes, yes.
[09:01.65]That desk is where he spent most of his time working when he wasn't in court.
[09:05.47]Is this person talking to me while we're both in the bathroom and they're in the stall while I'm washing my hands?
[09:12.44]And what's inside this alleged book?
[09:14.90]Your father didn't tell you?
[09:17.81]It was a ledger containing all the names of the accused witches from the Salem witch trials And then somebody else comes in the bathroom about his conviction, and you're like fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck the means hey Stop talking.
[09:29.00]This is odd what we're doing.
[09:31.06]Yeah, oh
[09:34.43]Because they don't know that somebody just... Oh, yeah, we just came into the bathroom, but we're, like, just us two.
[09:39.15]It's like nobody's house is here.
[09:40.45]You're in the stall.
[09:41.09]I'm, like, just doing my... I'm just, like, fucking shaving.
[09:44.13]I'm, like, picking my nose hairs out.
[09:45.63]And you're just talking.
[09:46.89]You're just monologuing to me from the stall.
[09:49.86]And then some old guy walks in.
[09:52.04]And... I don't... I don't think... Just slow down.
[09:55.08]Alright, interact.
[10:00.46]Hold to look.
[10:01.59]I found a letter.
[10:03.17]It's addressed to Abigail Hathorne Woodley.
[10:06.29]What does it say?
[10:07.78]I do regret to write to you in this state.
[10:11.02]I have been wracked with guilt as my fervency of spirit was too great to determine a conviction just... Nancy, just sell this.
[10:19.00]This is probably worth like eight grand.
[10:24.26]Somebody else will read this.
[10:25.10]Wait, I have to read this, don't I?
[10:28.63]Wait.
[10:28.99]Read.
[10:29.17]You read it.
[10:29.81]Come on.
[10:48.11]To right the wrongs I made in zealous blindness, I'm writing a book I call The Book of Apologies.
[10:54.37]To be worthy of his mercy, I'm traveling the world to note down all the names of those wrongfully accused of witchcraft.
[11:02.49]Let this be my final legacy, my only way to right the wrongs I've helped create.
[11:07.31]My guilt allows me not to ask for forgiveness, though know that my soul remains forever tortured by the knowledge of what I have done.
[11:19.52]Alright, any, like, fucking codes?
[11:22.59]I don't know.
[11:27.05]Alright.
[11:30.01]Ooh, here we go.
[11:30.86]You didn't think I was gonna click on this shit, did you?
[11:33.10]Press the secret button and go into Grandpa's secret compartment.
[11:38.48]I wouldn't do this.
[11:41.57]No, I wouldn't do this.
[11:42.39]I wouldn't.
[11:43.29]Because if, like, I don't know, if, like, Grandpa has, like, a secret fucking door and a compartment and shit, I don't know what's in here.
[11:48.18]There could be drugs.
[11:50.78]There could be, like, I don't know, there's, like, porn collection from, like, fucking, like, the 40s or something.
[11:55.14]I don't want this.
[11:55.84]In fact, I would, I probably, I would just burn this thing.
[12:00.73]I don't know what's in here.
[12:11.74]Alright, I need a key that's shaped like a U. This is on master difficulty, just so you guys know.
[12:16.70]Oh, here we go.
[12:17.16]We can examine... Okay, that's scary.
[12:24.54]Just come in the room!
[12:27.24]Why are you standing outside the door?
[12:28.92]Just come into the room.
[12:33.12]And why is there dialog options?
[12:36.51]What else can you tell me about the Book of Apologies?
[12:38.60]I wanna know.
[12:39.24]What else can you tell me about the Book of Apologies?
[12:42.34]As I mentioned, it's the book written by Judge Samuel Sewell himself, detailing the names of people accused of witchcraft.
[12:50.71]Sewell was one of the very few judges who regretted his actions.
[12:54.23]The book became his way of finding redemption.
[12:57.57]Sewell himself was originally from England, but acted as a judge in the Salem Witch Trials.
[13:03.38]Mouths off.
[13:05.50]The whole game is played with the mouth.
[13:08.16]How much is that fucking making you guys angry?
[13:23.11]Not only is there a cursor on the screen always, but it's moving, so I have to look at it.
[13:27.37]Humans are like cats.
[13:28.89]That's why nobody wants a cursor on the screen, because if I go over here, your eyes just went to the right.
[13:33.26]If I go this way, you're following it right now.
[13:35.24]I am.
[13:35.80]So are you.
[13:37.30]You're looking... Right, ready?
[13:40.18]You're looking in the lower left portion of the screen right now.
[13:42.03]And by the way, we're gonna do a theory here.
[13:44.61]And we'll see in like 30 minutes, I'm gonna tell you exactly where you're looking.
[13:49.11]And it's gonna be one of those magic trick shows.
[13:51.31]Where like you got to participate.
[13:53.96]Alright.
[13:55.72]Who cares?
[13:56.12]Let's go.
[13:59.77]Alright, every desk, there's gonna be like one random button.
