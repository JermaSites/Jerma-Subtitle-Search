[00:07.94]Hello.
[00:08.32]I told you it was going to be no later than 5.
[00:12.81]I said no later than 5 p.m.
[00:19.07]And it is 4.59.
[00:19.39]I told you there was no way it was going to be later than that.
[00:27.92]Were you in chat?
[00:30.42]um for a for maybe five minutes over the last hour and 10 minutes I think the chat was open but that's just to make sure I have it prepared for when I truly am live yeah the only excuse for this is if you are turn on a face cam and you're in a full fat suit
[01:00.17]Yeah, sorry, guys.
[01:01.37]I had to get in a big fat suit.
[01:07.07]No, that is unfortunately not the case.
[01:12.98]This is going to be an instant classic stream.
[01:17.14]We'll see.
[01:18.48]I'm just going to watch ads.
[01:23.01]I have some compilations of 80s and 90s commercials.
[01:29.32]These streams are comfy.
[01:30.30]I like these too.
[01:30.86]It's fun just to kind of watch and hang out.
[01:34.72]I'm enjoying it already.
[01:40.84]Yeah, I'll do face cam for a little bit.
[01:43.94]I'll do face cam for a little bit.
[01:49.86]Are these American or international?
[01:51.44]These are American, I believe.
[01:56.25]At least most of them are.
[02:03.34]But yeah, I don't plan on streaming for that long today.
[02:08.63]I'm not going to give a time limit, but it's probably going to be a few hours.
[02:12.77]Something like that.
[02:14.03]I feel like there's only so many of these I can do before I just need to take a bath.
[02:25.04]And then I'll be live tomorrow.
[02:35.00]Why are you taking a bath?
[02:36.33]Bath?
[02:40.84]Well guys, I don't know.
[02:41.68]It's nice to take a bath sometimes.
[02:46.49]What are we doing tomorrow?
[02:47.27]We are playing House Flipper Farm Flipper Update, or whatever the hell it is.
[02:53.82]I'm very excited for it, as you know.
[02:56.26]Maybe you don't.
[02:57.00]You might be new to the stream.
[03:00.27]House Flipper is one of my favorite games ever.
[03:02.99]And I'm probably the only person on Twitch that has streamed it for 100 hours.
[03:09.21]I can claim that fame, I think.
[03:16.30]If somebody has streamed longer than me, then... Yep.
[03:19.70]I'm good.
[03:22.02]You can take that award.
[03:40.80]Have you been doing... Am I going to read that?
[03:48.76]Alright, are you guys ready?
[03:49.48]We're gonna watch some ads.
[03:53.04]I got compilations.
[03:54.22]I'm ready.
[03:55.99]Are you ready?
[04:00.15]Are you excited?
[04:00.95]There's only like 2,000 people here that heard that, so I don't care.
[04:26.20]It's 10k?
[04:27.02]What?
[04:28.72]My thing says 2.
[04:29.30]There's way more people who just heard that.
[04:33.04]Whatever.
[04:33.36]I feel like if you've decided to watch this stream, you've already decided what could happen here.
[04:41.09]Does that make sense?
[04:44.88]I feel like if you've been here, and you have watched more than one stream, I think you know that this stream sucks.
[04:59.92]Let's go.
[05:00.30]Alright, I'm ready.
[05:02.88]No, this stream is sick, actually.
[05:04.50]This is a good stream.
[05:05.61]I like this stream.
[05:06.65]It's my stream, so I want to say that.
[05:08.89]Come on.
[05:17.03]This is mid shit.
[05:22.23]I like this mid shit.
[05:24.37]Alright.
[05:28.49]Now let's watch commercials together.
[05:30.64]What's up?
[05:38.58]Alright.
[05:44.11]This is 80s.
[05:46.89]Are we ready?
[05:47.35]Are we sure it's not too loud?
[05:50.80]Yeah, back off.
[05:53.92]Hair dye.
[05:54.58]No hair dye, actually.
[05:56.88]I'm just gonna go until it looks bad.
[05:59.18]You know what I mean?
[06:02.38]If I started using hair dye now, why'd you go with 986 and not 985?
[06:08.11]I don't know.
[06:16.16]No, I'm just going to age.
[06:18.26]However I look is how I look.
[06:19.56]I'm just going to age.
[06:26.89]Alright, let's go.
[06:27.87]I don't know why I sat there for so long.
[06:29.21]Alright.
[06:30.31]Are you ready?
[06:31.67]These are 80s commercials.
[06:32.91]I can't wait to start to talk about them.
[06:35.91]Oh, it's not too loud.
[06:36.67]Return after these messages.
[06:38.39]I think it's alright.
[06:39.05]Alright.
[06:42.85]Okay, everybody, come outside.
[06:45.65]Everybody ready for a wild wet ride?
[06:48.39]I had one of these.
[06:50.62]You can put it on your lawn.
[06:52.16]Turn the water on.
[06:53.36]Then you run, run, run.
[06:54.80]And you're sliding on your top.
[06:57.04]Slip, slip and slide.
[06:59.75]Slip, slip and slide.
[07:02.31]These were fun.
[07:07.82]I'm pausing.
[07:08.68]Don't stop pausing.
[07:09.74]Don't skip.
[07:10.20]I just have to say something about this.
[07:12.89]These things are really fun.
[07:13.75]Until you hit a bunch of rocks.
[07:17.23]There was always that one, that one kid that was, the thing was laid out and you start all the way at the back of the yard and you run as fast as you possibly can.
[07:27.19]This thing was not, this thing was not designed for you to go that fast on it.
[07:32.53]You could just go off of it or there'd be a bump in the grass and it would be a fucking rock.
[07:38.23]And you would just start sprinting.
[07:39.91]Sprint, sprint, sprint, jump, like lay out and just fucking slide like a cartoon bowling alley.
[07:45.86]Like you're sliding all the way down.
[07:48.66]And then you sort of rock on your elbow.
[07:50.76]These things were crazy.
[07:53.06]This thing was a hazard.
[07:53.78]It really was.
[07:55.38]Yeah, it was a hazard.
[08:00.92]It was still fun, though.
[08:01.88]It was.
[08:06.11]Didn't they make changes to this over the years where you kind of couldn't go that fast?
[08:11.17]I feel like that was... I feel like that's accurate.
[08:16.03]Oh, I didn't tweet.
[08:19.31]Okay.
[08:20.25]Let me tweet.
[08:26.82]And there was always that kid at the party or whatever that they did this until they went home.
[08:35.72]It was, okay, let's get the slip and slide out.
[08:37.68]And, like, little Jerry just does not stop for eight hours.
[08:42.88]It's the only thing they do.
[08:48.08]They were fun, though.
[08:48.82]Alright, let me tweet.
[08:51.97]Hey, there's a tweet.
[08:52.81]Good.
[08:53.25]Okay.
[08:58.09]Alright.
[08:58.45]Officially tweeted.
[08:59.19]Hold on.
[09:00.93]Oh, I turned that off.
[09:05.75]They are going fast, though.
[09:06.99]I wanna see how fast they're actually going.
[09:08.41]Yeah.
[09:09.39]Yeah, you sprint!
[09:25.21]Slip and Slide comes with plastic slide and fasteners from Wham-O.
[09:29.77]And fasteners.
[09:31.17]Did anybody even use those?
[09:32.50]Hamburgers for Ronald.
[09:34.26]Grimace, let's go to... Stay.
[09:45.31]Hamburgers for Ronald.
[09:47.29]I think this is trying to tell me something.
[09:52.45]McDonald's hamburgers I should have known it's a good time for the great taste thank you you're welcome
[10:20.72]What the fuck?
[10:23.08]How does this not hurt?
[10:30.29]This would be excruciating pain.
[10:31.89]What?
[10:32.29]I want to see more of what happened there.
[10:44.86]That dude had a straight face.
[10:46.77]What was that an ad for?
[10:48.73]What was that an ad for?
[10:53.75]They did, oh, for Turbo Teen.
[10:56.50]Okay.
[10:59.02]What was it trying to show us?
[11:01.04]Excuse me.
[11:02.16]Excuse me.
[11:11.66]The no reaction is just... I don't know if I like it.
[11:15.64]I don't... This like... There needs to be a little bit of, I think, emotion here.
[11:24.70]We'll return after these messages.
[11:30.57]Hey, I bet you can't see.
[11:33.13]That's the same guy.
[11:34.15]That's the same kid right there.
[11:36.45]This is one of the Turbo teens.
[11:38.17]He's in the same outfit.
[11:40.43]Floppy flat fruit snacks from Sunkist.
[11:45.39]What?
[11:46.15]Sunkist fruit rolls are made with real fruit.
[11:48.91]And they're real fun to eat.
[11:50.77]Flip flop fruit snacks from Sunkist.
[11:53.75]But if you ask for fruit rolls, you may not get Sunkist.
[11:56.33]So you can just say the fracky fruit fracks from Sunkist.
[12:02.32]Sunkist fruit rolls.
[12:03.48]That's super accurate, though.
[12:04.70]Kids just like that.
[12:08.66]When kids, kids really just love just random made up words.
[12:13.51]It's just so fun to them.
[12:14.81]That's a very accurate commercial.
[12:18.05]You try it.
[12:18.83]What was it?
[12:19.17]Let me see if I can do it.
[12:22.12]Well, let me give me a second to do it.
[12:25.26]Hey, I bet you can't say floppy flat fruit snacks.
[12:35.59]The floppy, the floppy flat fruit snacks from Sunkist.
[12:40.12]I didn't, I couldn't do it.
[12:41.98]The floppy, the floppy flat fruit snacks from Sunkist.
[12:44.80]The floppy flat fruit snacks from Sunkist.
[12:48.30]Fucking easy.
[12:48.82]It's not that hard.
[12:57.94]Yes.
[12:58.36]What simpler times.
[12:59.54]Wow.
[12:59.70]Times are so different.
[13:30.20]This was enough to drive everybody crazy.
[13:39.79]I got a standing ovation back in the 80s.
[13:43.57]Times are so simple back then.
[13:50.54]From Mattel.
[13:53.92]Hey, kid, have a carrot.
[13:55.46]A carrot?

[16:15.74]One day, Goldilocks and the Gingerbread Man were bringing delicious sauces to Grandma.
[16:19.26]Wait a minute.
[16:20.78]That's not a description!
[16:22.06]You're in the wrong story.
[16:23.38]I am.
[16:23.76]Aren't you, Little Bo Peep?
[16:26.02]Hold it!

[16:46.13]Why?
[16:46.33]How could you hate Ronald McDonald?

[17:35.66]Don't forget your boots and coats.
[17:38.06]Folks, we guarantee the show that we perform is never dull.
[17:42.31]If there's a lull, it's just the calm before the storm.
[17:45.37]Watch it change from icy cold to toasty warm.
[17:49.45]And rearrange from sunny days to crazy storms.
[17:53.00]The curtain's rising.
[17:54.36]We're so glad to have you here.
[17:56.39]Come see a new show daily in the atmosphere.
[18:00.61]Act 1, The Sun.
[18:03.61]The sun shines down on field and town, on forest, mountain, desert, sea, and snow.
[18:10.70]Some heat, some storm, some bounces off.
[18:14.72]Damn.
[18:15.38]So here it's hot.
[18:16.18]This is an ad.
[18:16.92]Maybe not.
[18:18.02]It's just here.
[18:18.56]The heated Earth heats up the air just like a big hot air balloon.
[18:26.21]Sing with, I don't know the lyrics.
[18:27.91]Whoa.
[18:28.09]There's science here.
[18:29.07]Look.
[18:42.58]I don't give a shit that you have coffee.
[18:47.06]I want this.
[18:48.40]Get this back.
[18:49.42]The air begins to move and flow.
[18:52.75]It circulates at different rates.
[18:56.99]And that creates the winds that blow.
[19:00.23]The highs are nice.
[19:01.41]They bring fair skies.
[19:02.93]But a low will offer
[19:05.73]How do you read this chat?
[19:06.63]Laughing my ass off.
[19:07.88]I'm playing Metal Gear Solid 5, so I won't listen for your answer.
[19:11.18]Whoa, why am I reading your comment?
[19:14.50]What?
[19:16.84]What does that mean?
[19:18.40]You asked a question and you just dipped right after asking the question.
[19:23.32]Did I go to... No, it's the same one.
[19:36.08]When clouds appear rain may be near because of a first school and starting to condense and if those
[19:50.60]Skimmer, you're not learning.
[19:51.96]How do you know that?
[19:54.76]Skip it if it's not an ad?
[20:00.46]Well, I kind of like this.
[20:02.38]I mean, Herboteen technically wasn't an ad.
[20:05.13]I'm glad I didn't skip that.

[20:50.07]Kellogg's Rice Krispies, the talking part of this complete breakfast.
[20:53.86]Hold on a second.
[20:55.00]Good work, guys!
[20:56.08]Kellogg's Rice Krispies
[20:57.95]I love this because this is actually really hard.
[20:59.85]This is really difficult.
[21:02.85]This kid can't see these characters.
[21:06.49]They probably told him to look in a certain direction, and this is really hard to do.
[21:12.16]So... Kellogg's Rice Krispies.
[21:17.32]I want to see the beginning again.
[21:19.94]I want to see... Oh, they're sleeping.
[21:21.74]Schoolhouse Rock is brought to you by Kellogg's.
[21:27.33]They are in REM sleep right now.
[21:30.99]And this kid drops the equivalent of like three bowling balls on the table right next to his head.
[21:37.05]Right next to his head.
[21:39.83]Look at that reaction.
[21:42.77]Look at this.
[21:43.11]They're not happy.
[21:43.59]This is awful.
[21:44.27]This is awful.
[21:46.61]Look at the fear in these faces.
[21:52.03]This is uncomfortable.
[21:53.86]This is awful.
[21:55.79]They still don't know.
[21:56.31]Look at how tired they are.
[21:57.41]To do what?
[21:59.68]I don't know.
[22:04.12]What was this kid waking them up for?
[22:08.46]He's still not out of it yet.
[22:09.38]Keep in mind, they just were ripped out of REM sleep and told they needed to do this today.
[22:26.47]Racking when Crackle comes through.
[22:28.47]There's no stopping once Pop is popping.
[22:31.09]Snap, Crackle, Pop talking just to you.
[22:33.38]Sounds good.
[22:34.18]Kellogg's Rice Krispies, the talking part of this complete breakfast.
[22:35.84]Was their job to pour the cereal?
[22:38.16]Good work, guys.

[22:56.90]I don't know why I thought that was so funny.
[23:04.65]Just listen, hold on.
[23:11.37]This is ABC.
[23:14.51]I don't know why that's funny to me.
[23:19.85]Is that funny?
[23:20.43]I think it's because I could hear like the, this is ABC.
[23:25.27]Make sure the power lines are far away.
[23:28.58]When your daddy and you make the house look fine.
[23:32.00]Don't raise ladders or antennas near power lines.
[23:35.08]Wait, why are they doing this?
[23:36.02]If this lightning bug doesn't raise his antenna near power lines, no way!
[23:40.76]You've got to stay away from power lines.
[23:44.10]You've got to stay away from power lines.
[23:48.59]Yeah, OK.
[23:48.91]That's a good tip.
[23:53.31]We'll return after these messages.
[24:01.55]You're in the big leagues.
[24:04.31]Big league pouch.
[24:05.37]When you keep the team alive.
[24:06.63]You're in the big leagues.
[24:08.12]Big league shreds.

[24:10.54]You're in the big leagues.
[24:12.00]Big league flavor.
[24:13.36]You're into big league chew.
[24:15.08]Big league chew.
[24:16.24]Band size wads of great tasting shredded bubble gum stuffed into a giant stay fresh pouch.

[24:23.47]Big league flavor and big league bubble.
[24:26.25]You're into big league chew.
[24:32.33]Did it say man-sized?
[24:34.75]No, it didn't.
[24:35.41]That stuff is delicious, by the way.
[24:36.89]I love that stuff.
[24:56.59]That there's OJ Joe.
[25:00.91]I haven't had it in a long time, but it was good.
[25:04.26]Where they'll take the sweet juice and put it into new OJs.
[25:07.84]A crunchy, delicious, orange-tasting cereal.
[25:10.78]Let's eat them up.
[25:12.80]That's one delicious orange taste, OJ.
[25:15.38]That's my brand.
[25:17.28]OJs are packed with vitamin C. It's a cereal.
[25:20.61]New OJ.

[45:35.84]It's probably gross.
[45:36.66]...that safely loosen hardened wax when used as directed, plus an ear washer to gently flush wax away.
[45:42.94]Murine, the complete medically approved system to safely remove earwax.
[45:51.77]The temperature is well below zero this morning.
[45:56.99]Perfect to test Chevy's heartbeat.
[45:59.65]You've got a countdown.
[46:02.38]With the electrical system fully taxed, Chevy delivers reliable cold starting.

[46:13.59]With 84 models redesigned and engineered, GM is putting quality on the road.
[46:18.57]Alright, I was going to say, there's like 100 million people in the United States that do what they did like a third of the whole year, and there's not a whole team of people with walkie-talkies.
[46:34.34]It's Velveeta versus cheddar.
[46:38.78]That is thick.
[46:39.42]Oh, that's not.
[46:39.98]I thought it was orange juice.
[46:41.64]That would be fucking awful.
[46:44.30]Orange juice.
[46:46.92]That actually didn't even look good.
[46:49.47]That looked kind of gross, didn't it?

[47:11.64]I mean, you saw what was on camera.
[47:13.30]Every day, 22 million people come into McDonald's.
[47:17.24]They count on the same hot, fresh food at every McDonald's all over the world.

[47:27.44]and 22 million people came in at the same time.
[47:32.28]The whole restaurant would fill up, the city would fill up, and all those people in one place would cause the Earth to tilt off its axis and go spinning into space.
[47:51.61]Good thing we can avoid this catastrophic event by McDonald's having like 50,000 locations.
[47:55.54]McDonald's protects us.

[48:35.11]The hot new spirit of Dodge.
[48:37.76]Oh, it was!
[48:38.78]Now get a $2,000 back at Dodge, guaranteed.
[48:45.03]Bravest men.
[48:45.77]Ain't no dream.
[48:47.45]Turbo teen.
[48:49.13]Are those with something to prove.
[48:51.37]They got to know that nobody's going to win.
[48:53.03]Red cars were just super popular.
[48:54.81]Someday they're going to let the 54 get into us.
[48:57.67]Matthew Broderick.
[48:58.51]We'll be ready, sir.
[48:59.73]Denzel Washington.

[49:03.33]Ready!
[49:04.63]Morgan Freeman.
[49:07.92]Glory.
[49:08.82]Rated R. Now playing at a theater near you.
[49:14.03]In DeMont, Washington, when a kid's 18, he's old enough to drive.
[49:17.09]There it is.
[49:18.79]And old enough to worry about something most adults have.
[49:21.45]Gingivitis, an early reversible gum disease that left untreated, could get serious.
[49:26.31]Just ask your dentist.
[49:27.77]Fortunately, many know enough to use Listerine, the only non-prescription mouthwash accepted by the American Dental Association for helping to prevent and reduce plaque in gingivitis.
[49:37.32]Yep, if you're old enough to worry about gum disease... Hold on, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[49:41.12]They're not ready for this ball.
[49:42.84]yep if you're old oh was somebody there I couldn't tell enough to worry about gum disease you ought to be smart enough to use listerine I want to try something different um
[49:55.20]Hold on.
[49:55.52]I gotta process this one.
[49:57.64]Oh, rewatch Andy.
[49:59.54]I know.
[50:00.18]I need to see it.
[50:00.72]Now playing at a theater near you.
[50:02.75]What were they saying?
[50:05.25]When you turn 18, you worry about driving a car.
[50:07.73]What was it?
[50:09.17]In DeMont, Washington, when a kid's 18, he's old enough to drive.
[50:13.09]Why only there?
[50:13.83]Is it... Old enough to vote and old enough to worry about something most adult.
[50:18.97]Old enough to drive, old enough to boat.
[50:21.81]And old enough to be terribly concerned about your gums.
[50:25.33]Gingivitis, an early reversible gum disease that left untreated could get serious.
[50:30.15]Just ask your dentist.
[50:32.80]Vote?
[50:34.26]What?
[50:35.32]I thought this was like some boomer shit.
[50:37.42]Like, oh, you're old enough to drive?
[50:38.64]You're old enough to go vote?
[50:40.04]Most adults have gingivitis back in 1980?
[50:41.26]What?
[51:03.22]Yep, if you're old enough to worry about gum disease, you ought to be smart enough to use Listerine.
[51:09.53]I want to try something different.
[51:11.39]Can you make me look like that?
[51:12.71]Tuesday, it's a brand new job.
[51:14.33]100% of those residents haven't changed their life.
[51:15.43]Oh, I'm sure you can, Iris.
[51:16.25]I'll go get the wand.
[51:17.35]But she's the same old person.
[51:19.45]100% of those residents.
[51:20.37]I'm not going to spend the rest of my life splicing wire.
[51:23.74]We all got chances, Elvis.
[51:25.56]Some of them we just can't take.
[51:27.30]In 1954, Vernon Presley wanted his son to have a steady job with a secure future.
[51:32.08]Well, I said, tell me, baby, what's wrong with you?
[51:36.10]His dream came true.
[51:37.26]A special preview of Elvis, Tuesday.
[51:40.01]Oh.
[51:40.37]Sammy Davis Jr.'
[51:41.17]'s 60th anniversary celebration will continue in a moment.
[51:44.77]You don't want, you don't get.
[51:45.73]That's arithmetic.
[51:46.95]Joe Kennedy.
[51:47.97]He became the father of two senators and a president.
[51:50.76]You were a very successful and wealthy man.
[51:53.28]Isn't that winning?
[51:54.48]No, not yet.
[51:55.50]He had an appetite for power.
[51:57.64]For the first Irish Catholic ambassador to England.
[52:00.22]Wealth and women.
[52:04.03]I've never made history with anyone I've made love with.
[52:06.61]How soon will you be home?
[52:08.70]If there's any dirty work to be done, I'll be the one to do it.
[52:11.12]The Kennedys of Massachusetts, two weeks from tonight.
[52:18.30]To the eye, the Lexus LS 400 looks like an elegantly contoured luxury sedan.
[52:30.63]I can't.
[52:32.87]To the wind, however, it doesn't look like much.
[52:40.44]The Lexus LS 400, the most aerodynamic luxury sedan in America.
[52:44.42]Nothing fucking funny even happens.
[52:46.32]It's just a car just like slowly was zoomed in on, and it's like enough to make two weeks.
[52:50.22]Wow.
[52:51.34]Why do I think cars are so funny?
[52:53.02]I don't know why.
[52:54.88]To the eye, the Lexus LS 400.
[52:57.58]I think it's because a lot of car companies treat cars like they're alive.
[53:02.16]Like an animal or like it's a person or something.
[53:05.19]To me, this is like a living being.
[53:07.57]It's like, oh, look it, I'm... There's like nobody in there in my brain for some reason.
[53:11.47]It's like an elegantly contoured luxury sedan.
[53:13.13]It just makes me laugh every time.
[53:19.25]Because it's like there's nobody in this car.
[53:21.25]And it's just like moving around and look at how luxurious I am.
[53:25.55]I'm a fucking car.
[53:28.73]It doesn't look like much.
[53:30.49]The Lexus LS 400, the most aerodynamic luxury sedan in America.
[53:36.26]What about turbo teen?
[53:37.04]That's what I'm saying.
[53:38.68]Wanna give yourself a treat?
[53:41.28]You wanna taste that can't be beat?
[53:42.98]Have a little sunshine, sunshine.
[53:44.90]You like seeing living beings getting hurt?
[53:47.34]That's what a car crash is to you?
[53:49.12]Have a little sunshine, sunshine.
[53:53.47]Just about every cookie and cracker sunshine makes has absolutely no cholesterol.
[53:58.37]Now what could be better than sunshine?
[54:00.21]Have a little sunshine, sunshine.
[54:02.64]Have a little sunshine, have a little sunshine.
[54:07.30]Pentagon waste reaches the billions on 7 at 11.
[54:10.24]No cholesterol in cookies, but alright.
[54:15.74]The producers of the show, the producers of the show was hoping you'd have a little more feeling, more Mike, you know, a little bit more Mike Tyson, you know, more Mike Tyson-isms, like, like... Hello, ladies and gentlemen, Sammy and I would like...
[54:31.42]What is happening?
[54:37.78]We keep seeing the beginning and the middle of all these things that the programming was.
[54:41.60]Oh, yeah.
[54:43.75]Rock music.
[54:52.65]Hey, Rizzucci.
[54:54.05]Look a little pale.
[54:55.05]Maybe he needs a doctor or something.
[54:57.79]Maybe I do.
[55:09.72]What?
[55:10.50]That was very confusing.
[55:13.52]I'm laughing at the car.
[55:16.82]I'm laughing at that last one.
[55:18.82]I know it was bad timing that a car came on screen.
[55:31.44]It's not.
[55:32.06]I'm laughing at that last commercial.
[55:33.86]What are you... You have to drive it to believe it.
[55:37.78]The New Accord.
[55:41.42]This is delicious, Danny.
[55:42.46]What do you call it?
[55:43.62]It's new ragu, fresh Italian pasta sauce.
[55:45.92]So delicate.
[55:47.62]What's it called?
[55:49.38]Fresh Italian pasta sauce.
[55:50.86]Yeah, it's really fresh, but what's the name of this?
[55:52.50]See, ragu uses less heavy tomato paste and twice the crushed tomatoes.
[55:57.82]But...
[55:58.94]What's the name?
[55:59.62]Then total.
[56:00.16]Fuck that cereal, by the way.
[56:03.02]More crushed tomatoes, more fresh tomato taste.
[56:05.71]There's a jar.
[56:07.23]Look, it has his name on it.
[56:08.57]Forget it.
[56:09.18]Just forget it.
[56:10.85]They instantly turn on.
[56:12.13]You put that show lead on, and that spark is right there.
[56:15.86]That's the difference between a good dog and a great dog.
[56:18.56]These are champions.
[56:19.42]They deserve the best.
[56:20.60]And I recommend Pedigree and Pedigree Mealtime.
[56:22.74]Pedigree.
[56:23.68]Recommended by top breeders.
[56:25.90]And now there's a new kind of Pedigree.
[56:27.99]Pedigree Choice Cuts.
[56:29.63]Tender, juicy, meaty chunks with a sauce dogs can't resist.
[56:33.35]One look shows you it's choice.
[56:34.89]One feeding shows you it's irresistible.
[56:36.65]New Pedigree Choice Cuts.
[56:38.61]Recommended by top breeders.
[56:41.38]My poor brother, Tom.
[56:43.12]Every time he tried to see what he was missing, he would miss what he was seeing.
[56:47.05]The dog did it, too.
[56:49.25]Then Tom got this amazing Magnavox TV that lets him watch one show while he checks out all the others on this remarkable little window.
[56:56.41]Hey, that's a smart window, Dick.
[56:58.21]That's what they call it, Tom.
[57:00.46]They call it Tom?
[57:01.90]No, no.
[57:02.50]They call it smart window, Tom.
[57:03.94]This was a big deal.
[57:04.66]I kind of like Tom.
[57:07.65]Magnavox.
[57:08.57]Smart choice.
[57:09.55]Very smart.
[57:10.41]The technology to do that was actually kind of crazy back in the day.
[57:12.91]I am now officially a teenager.
[57:15.03]It's DJ's first kiss.
[57:16.73]13 candles.
[57:20.43]An all-new full house.
[57:22.91]I'm 13!
[57:23.97]Followed by a new family matters Friday.
[57:28.23]Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue.
[57:30.93]Full episode.
[57:32.47]Driving pretty.
[57:33.15]Driving smart.
[57:36.43]Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue is saying something all new.
[57:40.78]And it's all about comfort, style, and technology.
[57:44.44]And Chrysler's exclusive Crystal Key Honor program completes the package.
[57:48.37]This is so stupid.
[57:50.15]I'm pissed off at myself.
[57:51.45]I'm laughing.
[57:52.61]It wasn't even what I was laughing at.
[57:57.41]I actually wasn't even laughing at that.
[57:59.19]I think I'm in love.
[58:02.07]I was laughing at the guy just absolutely chucking, just throwing that.
[58:06.91]Just whipping it over there.
[58:10.00]Like he just throws that shit.
[58:12.82]That's all I can focus on.
[58:16.64]And Chrysler's exclusive Crystal Key Honor program completes the package.
[58:21.02]The all-new Chrysler New Yorker 5th.
[58:31.38]I think I'm in love.
[58:32.56]Who now?
[58:33.14]That goddess on the raft.
[58:34.66]Out of your league.
[58:36.70]Oh yeah?
[58:37.30]Yeah.
[58:37.84]Yeah.
[58:38.98]Watch and learn.
[58:48.40]May I have a towel?
[58:50.78]Richard?
[58:52.58]Never underestimate the doctor.
[58:55.60]Nope.
[58:56.14]Nope.
[58:56.84]Nope.
[58:57.26]Nope.
[58:57.42]That's not what would have happened.
[59:02.89]It would have gone like this.
[59:03.63]Hey.
[59:13.72]This morning, I was following a Sears service truck when it dawned on me.
[59:17.80]I see Sears trucks all the time.
[59:19.70]It also dawned on me that I hardly ever see a service truck from those so-called super stores.
[59:25.02]So before you make that next big buying decision, ask yourself what kind of service you'll get five years from now, or if they'll even be around to answer the phone.
[59:33.39]That's one of the big reasons I feel better when I buy a major appliance or electronics from Sears.
[59:39.11]And that's what they mean by your money's worth and a whole lot more.
[59:42.66]Yeah.
[59:43.96]Yeah.
[59:45.00]Know what a lot of today's teens are doing?
[59:47.42]They're thinking about their futures and the future of Black America.
[59:51.73]That's why once again, McDonald's celebrates Black History Month by looking to the future.
[59:56.67]Join us now as we salute our 1990 McDonald's Black History Makers of Tomorrow.
[60:01.71]These 10 teens have been selected because of their visions, their dreams, and the roles they want to play as leaders in America's future.
[60:09.26]And someday they may truly have a place in Black history.
[60:16.43]Theirs is gone.
[60:19.63]This commercial was awesome.
[60:22.01]I love every second of this commercial.
[60:26.73]I remember this one.
[60:31.02]Bite-sized Ritz Bitz peanut butter sandwiches.
[60:33.92]The taste of Ritz Bitz and real peanut butter in tiny sandwiches with no assembly required.
[60:39.18]That part.

[62:13.12]Thank God it didn't move.
[62:14.20]Thank God it didn't move.
[62:39.65]There's only one thing I used to hate worse than having to wash out my pantyhose every night.
[62:44.17]And that was having to throw them out.
[62:47.33]Pantyhose that last are no nonsense.
[62:51.10]I would lose.
[62:51.78]Ladies and gentlemen, Dennis Miller.
[63:00.94]I just knew they'd call.
[63:03.02]I wish I wasn't so easily amused by cars.
[63:07.65]It's almost as if someone once said, just in case people like sunshine and water, we'd better make Florida.
[63:14.22]And we'd better make miles of beautiful beaches and places like St.
[63:17.70]Augustine and Key West, just in case people want to go.
[63:20.70]Vote left?
[63:21.24]No.

[63:30.28]Easy.
[63:30.89]Including the ones that run through a state that's named after sunshine.
[63:36.84]Knowing how to read and write can really make you feel wanted.

[63:53.99]Jeffrey, what are we doing?
[63:55.21]We can't do this.

[64:00.92]Tuesday.

[64:11.33]But Whirlpool has it.
[64:12.63]I get it.
[64:13.77]Today.

[64:28.98]Why?
[64:30.02]Can't it just taste better?
[64:31.24]Isn't that allowed?
[64:33.18]Did you know Gallow made a white Zinfandel?
[64:34.76]No, it's terrific, isn't it?
[64:36.30]Am I going to get any credit for this?
[64:37.68]You didn't make the wine.
[64:41.19]Gallow present a very special white Zinfandel.
[64:44.81]It will change the way you think about Gallow.
[64:47.39]Snob.
[64:47.87]Wednesday.

[65:00.71]China Beach.
[65:03.90]Alpha Beta shoppers are finding when the new sign went up, the prices came down.
[65:08.86]For the last year, I shopped at Alpha Beta, and now that it's switched over to Lucky's, I find a significant reduction in my weekly grocery bill.
[65:17.58]It's important that I have quality and affordable prices, and I find that I get both of that when I shop at Lucky's.
[65:24.61]Okay.
[65:25.21]Alpha Beta is now Lucky.
[65:28.29]We think you'll like the change.

[66:25.19]It's where they share memories, and news, and opinions.
[66:30.51]It's where parents get to know their children, and their children's children.
[66:35.46]Homes will always be an important part of people's lives.
[66:38.88]That's why home loans are such a secure investment.
[66:42.10]And that's where Home Savings of America has put its depositors' money for more than a hundred years.

[68:09.83]Hey guys, we're going to take the entire baseball team and the other team and we're going to go to Denny's and it's probably just going to be free.
[68:19.11]That's kind of crazy.
[68:20.63]How would they do that?
[68:43.37]I feel great.
[68:44.88]Grape Nuts cereal is full of complex carbohydrates.
[68:47.78]You won't believe how it helps keep you going all morning.
[68:50.06]Look for this display in your store.
[68:51.94]Post Grape Nuts trying... But be careful you don't knock the fucking thing over because it's literally a house of cards.
[68:58.37]In a blind test, women compared new advanced formula agree shampoo to an expensive salon brand, Redken Amino Pond.
[69:06.13]I haven't had grape nuts in a long time.
[69:08.47]Agreed.
[69:09.21]I remember them being really good, but I feel like it's a fake memory.
[69:12.60]Are Ritz and Ritz Bits really the same?
[69:14.22]Well, that's a silly question.
[69:17.04]One's big and one's little.
[69:18.96]So they're different.
[69:19.68]But they're still the same.
[69:21.22]So they're the same.
[69:22.26]Don't you get it?
[69:23.86]Ritz or Ritz Bits.
[69:25.02]Two sizes fits all.
[69:27.67]Wednesday.
[69:28.15]I took Buster to the vet.
[69:29.63]And?
[69:30.13]Honey, is there something wrong with him?
[69:32.25]Well, nothing that can't be fixed.
[69:33.63]You'll get sympathy pains on The Wonder Years.
[69:36.12]Then... Grandpa Ed!
[69:37.50]A special episode.
[69:38.76]Nobody makes blueberry pancakes like you do, Margaret.
[69:41.42]Oh, those aren't blueberry pancakes.
[69:43.10]Share memories of Grandpa on Growing Pains, Wednesday.
[69:49.03]the healthcare industry in California did we see that one paper in a year where they were like what was it I don't know I feel like I've seen that one so how does one person keep from drowning in all this paper that would be so up memories of grandpa very pancakes like you do Margaret oh those aren't blueberry pancakes share memories of grandpa
[70:18.70]Does he think that they have bugs?
[70:22.04]It's a bunch of flies.
[70:29.21]That's so ridiculous.
[70:34.33]That's classic comedy right there.
[70:36.81]So they're the same.
[70:37.87]Don't you get it?
[70:39.45]Ritz or Ritz-Bitz.
[70:40.33]Two sizes fits all.
[70:43.27]Wednesday.
[70:43.77]I took Buster to the vet.
[70:45.23]And?
[70:45.71]Honey, is there something wrong with him?
[70:47.85]Well, nothing that can't be fixed.
[70:49.23]You'll get sympathy pains on the wonder years.
[70:51.71]Then, a special episode.
[70:54.35]Nobody makes blueberry pancakes like you do, Margaret.
[70:56.99]Oh, those aren't blueberry pancakes.
[70:58.69]Share memories of Grandpa on Growing Pains Wednesday.
[71:02.84]They're all laughing.
[71:03.66]Oh, it's so funny.
[71:04.62]The healthcare industry in California generates enough paper in a year to fill the Rose Bowl.
[71:11.60]Enough to cross the Golden Gate Bridge half a million times.
[71:15.73]So how does one person keep from drowning in all this paperwork?
[71:20.53]By turning to the one company big enough and innovative enough to offer plans where you never have to fill out one single claim form.
[71:28.39]Blue Cross of California.
[71:30.94]We make the system work for you.
[71:37.73]While the competition only offers a three-year warranty plan, TaylorMade Office Systems offers an exclusive five-year warranty plan on their Canon NP copiers with all of the guarantees in writing.
[71:53.22]Remember that the next time your copier company feeds you the same old line.
[72:01.64]Oh, it's actually for a... An Isuzu Rodeo?
[72:04.64]Then they'll start rich.
[72:05.74]Oh, not rich at all.
[72:07.44]Yet here they are with a bigger engine than our Toyota 4Runners.
[72:09.92]They have more power.
[72:11.08]It's an ugly thought.
[72:12.80]A longer wheelbase.
[72:13.84]So?
[72:14.14]It's for a smooth ride.
[72:15.42]Rear anti-lock brakes.
[72:16.88]Kids, put the tire back on.
[72:18.54]And more overall passenger space.
[72:20.46]Stop having fun.
[72:22.21]It doesn't add up.
[72:23.15]The Isuzu Rodeo.
[72:24.49]True, it doesn't add up.
[72:25.81]Oh, this is a long one.
[72:27.23]This is a long one.
[72:27.97]Now, with factory dealer incentives, air conditioning comes standard with any 4x2 rodeo for a limited time.
[72:33.30]Lots of men have heard about minoxidil.
[72:35.50]And lots of men have heard about Rogaine.
[72:37.04]This is a good one, though.
[72:37.82]But lots of men don't know that only Rogaine has minoxidil.
[72:41.48]And only your doctor can prescribe Rogaine.
[72:44.30]For more information, call this number now.
[72:45.98]Stop having fun.
[72:47.83]If you're wondering whether Rogaine is for you, call this number and we'll give you an incentive to find out.
[72:54.04]A certificate worth $10 toward a consultation visit with your doctor.
[72:58.70]Call 1-800-556-4800.
[72:59.40]Alright, I got to pee.
[73:05.16]Let me pause it.
[73:07.84]I've been drinking water.
[73:09.30]I'll be right back.
[73:10.94]We'll pick this back up in a sec.
[74:10.01]Uh, actually, I just got sent a link saying that you should watch this one, which is kind of interesting.
[74:15.19]I haven't seen this one yet.
[74:22.16]Uh, interestingly enough.
[74:26.26]Okay, well, let's watch it.
[74:30.81]Weird.
[74:31.17]Okay.
[74:48.13]You, come, come close.
[74:50.17]Gather.
[74:51.19]Yes, look what I've discovered.
[74:55.01]Oh, yeah?

[75:09.56]Huh?
[75:09.64]There, I play my Jerma card.
[75:19.76]Seriously?
[75:20.95]This'll be easy.
[75:22.05]Just watch.
[75:22.91]It's Jerma.
[75:24.09]He's pretty strong.
[75:24.93]Oh, yeah?
[75:25.67]I built my deck with glue made.
[75:28.03]Welcome to the time-lost world of Grotto Beasts.
[75:30.93]Here, two worlds clash for the amusement of Lord Zorakjo.
[75:34.31]No way.
[75:35.45]Then I summon Meowdi.
[75:43.32]Whoa.
[75:46.92]The two-player starter kit contains everything you need and more to get right into the action.
[75:53.02]Master the arts of grottos, beasts, and wishes.
[75:56.28]With 200 different cards, you must choose your challenger wisely.
[76:00.64]Hey, mister, will you stop doing that?
[76:03.48]Uh, oh.
[76:11.96]You can even call upon my power, so craft the strongest deck you can.
[76:19.41]Oh, that was a weird one.
[76:22.15]That was an interesting one.
[76:43.62]You have no idea how hard it was to shut the fuck up about this.
[76:49.16]It was so hard to not talk about this.
[77:02.91]Yeah.
[77:04.03]Weird.
[77:05.81]Interesting that this would show up today of all times.
[77:13.05]Should we watch it again?
[77:13.83]I think we watch it again.
[77:15.75]I think we watch it again.
[77:17.51]Let's watch it again.
[77:36.93]You, come, come close, gather.
[77:39.97]Yes, look what I've discovered.
[77:56.81]oh yeah watch this huh there I play my Jerma card
[78:08.52]Seriously?
[78:09.72]This'll be easy.
[78:10.80]Just watch.
[78:11.66]It's Jerma.
[78:12.86]He's pretty strong.
[78:13.68]Oh, yeah?
[78:14.44]I built my deck with glue, man.
[78:16.80]Welcome to the time-lost world of Grotto Beasts.
[78:19.70]Here, two worlds clash for the amusement of Lord Zorak's... Oh, no way!
[78:24.22]Then I summon Meowdy!
[78:32.08]Whoa!
[78:35.69]The two-player starter kit contains everything you need and more to get right into the action.
[78:41.78]Master the arts of grottos, beasts, and wishes.
[78:45.06]With 200 different cards, you must choose your challenger wisely.
[78:49.32]Hey, mister, will you stop doing that?
[78:52.27]Uh, oh.
[79:00.75]You can even call upon my power, so craft the strongest deck you can.
[79:07.99]Alright.
[79:09.81]Let's talk about it for a second.
[79:11.78]A lot of people worked on this.
[79:13.16]We have credits that I want to put up.
[79:14.88]That was Studio Yotta that did the animation work.
[79:37.40]And they did an unbelievably phenomenal job.
[79:43.36]Absolutely beautiful.
[79:48.83]And then the live action portion was produced by Indie Film Factory, which is a local group of Vegas filmmakers.
[80:01.48]So it was a long process to get this out here.
[80:06.00]But this was part of the reason to do the project anyways.
[80:09.48]It's going to have this 90s parody kind of world.
[80:16.15]And hopefully this commercial took a lot of work.
[80:20.41]Hope you enjoyed it.
[80:27.50]Long process.
[80:34.45]But yeah, let me show this real quick.
[80:36.74]I want to make sure that the people that did spend a bunch of time on this get some recognition for it, because it was phenomenal.
[80:42.96]Let me put it on screen.
[80:48.09]Let me just get it.
[80:50.87]Hopefully it fits.
[80:51.75]There's a lot of names on this list.
[80:53.73]All very important.
[80:56.23]The video will be public on the Grotto Beasts YouTube channel.
[81:05.09]Yeah, I'm so happy.
[81:06.29]I'm so glad to actually show that.
[81:11.13]And yeah, Grotto Beasts is out.
[81:13.87]It's available.
[81:15.43]I want to make sure I give a meaningful update to that.
[81:19.60]We had a couple of small shipping issues, but they're actively being investigated.
[81:25.12]And a lot of people have gotten their orders.
[81:26.62]We've seen a ton of people that have opened cards.
[81:29.56]And...
[81:31.23]We're so happy that people actually like it.
[81:34.57]That was a very, a huge amount of stress over the last six plus months is making sure like, fuck, I hope people like it.
[81:41.11]I really do.
[81:42.57]But a lot of people have been getting their orders.
[81:45.07]Seems like people think it's fun and interesting, which that is a huge weight off of everybody's shoulders because it was like, fuck, hopefully people actually like this.
[81:55.28]And no, the cards are not edible.
[81:58.84]Oh, let me see.
[82:00.39]Alright, let me get this shown.
[82:05.40]Here are the credits.
[82:10.60]Lots of work went into it.
[82:14.02]Here you go.
[82:18.83]Huge thank you to every single person on this list.
[82:21.37]From the people at Indie Film Factory to obviously Holly to Studio Yotta.
[82:25.57]All the people that came together to make what you just watched actually watchable.
[82:34.71]We're thinking of maybe putting up a clean version that doesn't have kind of the crust on it.
[82:42.97]But yeah.
[82:47.03]There it is.
[82:51.31]Yeah, there will be a no crust clean version uploaded.
[82:56.15]Obviously for this stream, I wanted to, you know, we wanted to make sure it was like 90s and 80s kind of aesthetic.
[83:04.77]Yeah, there it is.
[83:08.17]Bugleberry as himself.
[83:13.77]Crust is great.
[83:14.57]Oh, yeah.
[83:17.95]Tomar?
[83:18.48]Oh, yeah.
[83:21.28]They were awesome to work with, too.
[83:25.30]It's a swell group over there.
[83:31.91]Yeah, both versions will be uploaded.
[83:33.25]The Grotto Beasts YouTube will upload both of them.
[83:36.89]But now... Now I actually am going to take a BRB.
[83:42.46]Because I want to get some water.
[83:44.02]We'll put the other ads back up.
[83:50.93]Yeah.
[83:53.13]BRB.
[83:53.73]I'll see you guys in a minute.
[87:36.70]I keep forgetting to play the BRB music.
[87:38.54]I have it.
[87:38.82]I just keep forgetting to press the button.
[87:50.15]Oh, sorry.
[87:50.47]I scared you.
[87:53.29]But, um, yeah.
[87:55.09]Let's go back to watch more 80s and 90s ads.
[87:58.35]You just saw one.
[88:03.73]Remember next time.
[88:07.57]Yeah, we could probably get a GrottoBeasts.net if you have no idea what we're even talking about.
[88:16.20]Sort of a parody 90s card game that is essentially being treated as streamer merch.
[88:24.11]It's got a game built on top of it.
[88:29.04]It's available now.
[88:35.20]Why didn't you turn into a car during the commercial?
[88:42.23]Alright, uh... Let's uh, this compilation was pretty good.
[88:47.35]We'll stay on this one for a little bit.
[89:00.70]Hello.
[89:04.04]Asking the real questions, yeah.
[89:09.90]Okay, you ready?
[89:26.79]some men would rather live their lives sheltered in the harbor and some would rather sail into life with the unmistakable scent of old spice does old old spice smell the same as new old spice one of the legends of the city by the way I feel like it probably does aren't you glad you used dials to the airport let's go over the window here don't you wish everybody did do you have a handle for this window
[89:57.08]I would get out of that car.
[89:58.12]I would get out.
[89:58.74]I would just take it.
[90:00.04]I would get out.
[90:00.54]This lady is facing this way?
[90:01.80]How?
[90:01.92]What seat is this lady sitting in over here on the right?
[90:24.72]Wait, I'm so confused.
[90:25.74]Excuse me.
[90:28.66]Aren't you glad you used dials to the airport?
[90:32.84]Let's go over the window here.
[90:34.66]Don't you wish everybody did?
[90:38.10]She's standing or like, I don't know.
[90:40.87]So I start watching.
[90:41.93]There's not enough room to do that.
[90:43.29]Thought maybe I learned something.
[90:44.73]Then I see they have this guide, you know, to kind of help you figure out when everything's on.
[90:48.25]So I order it real easy.
[90:52.91]and I charge it.
[90:54.13]And now, a few weeks later, it's here.
[90:55.70]I mean, look at this thing.
[90:57.14]It's a magazine.
[90:58.16]TDC Magazine.
[91:00.64]I open it up, and there's this grid, which is great, because I can see the whole week at a glance.
[91:05.28]So I just circle the shows I want to see.
[91:07.84]And look at this.
[91:08.92]It's a complete description of every single show.
[91:11.56]And check this out.
[91:12.72]These photographs.
[91:14.18]Gorgeous.
[91:15.22]There's even articles by famous authors.
[91:17.66]Amazing.
[91:18.66]All I expected was a program guide, and I get all this?
[91:21.50]What a bargain.
[91:22.91]Hmm.
[91:24.11]I wonder if there'll ever be a swimsuit issue.
[91:27.43]This is the kind of thing that, like, Dad leaves a voicemail for you about.
[91:31.96]I've got this magazine.
[91:32.94]I'm telling you, you're going to love it.
[91:34.46]It's got all this educational stuff.
[91:35.62]You can circle your television shows.

[92:02.37]I wonder if there'll ever be a swimsuit issue call now that's a stretch and receive 12 monthly 14.95 your voice 50 off the cover price or tell the operator to bill you later these and Mastercard accepted um
[92:17.39]Oh, you're talking about me doing the... Whatever.
[92:19.07]I got muffins at McDonald's?
[92:20.15]When?
[92:40.05]All you've got to do is just choose the food.
[92:42.15]When were there muffins?
[92:43.46]That sounds amazing.
[92:44.06]Always good food, always good value at McDonald's.
[92:48.93]It can be downright frustrating and difficult to get perfect orange juice.
[92:54.07]One with that pure, fresh squeezed taste.
[92:56.90]They did this on that Guy Fieri game show.
[92:59.48]But if you remember that no other major brand of juice comes closer to this, then this, Tropicana Pure Premium, we think you will find everything will just fall into place.
[93:10.54]Yeah, minutes will win it.
[93:13.50]Tropicana Pure Premium.
[93:14.54]I mean, he missed almost all of them, so he's not going to get $10,000 or whatever it was.
[93:24.20]Just because the other guy is on the road doesn't mean his mind is.
[93:28.53]So the superb traction of the Subaru Legacy with four-wheel drive and anti-lock brakes can be quite a comfort.
[93:35.39]Since the next guy is capable of almost anything, shouldn't the same be true of your next car?
[93:44.88]This guy on his lawnmower.
[93:49.29]Oh my god, dude.
[93:54.67]He's wearing these like blackout shades and no audio.
[93:59.17]This guy doesn't even know what he's doing.
[94:02.87]And by the way, what a scary stunt person.
[94:06.87]This stuntman.
[94:08.49]I would be shitting my pants.
[94:10.21]Look at how close the car comes.
[94:13.17]The guy doesn't even flinch.
[94:14.60]Holy shit.
[94:31.89]Three hours, nine minutes.
[94:33.23]May I ask what you're doing?
[94:34.91]Timing tiny time pills.
[94:36.17]Excuse me?
[94:36.79]Well, this morning when I woke up, I talked like this, like that, so I took a contact.
[94:40.62]So?
[94:41.06]Well, contact has 600 tiny time pills that last 12 hours.
[94:44.06]I've got three times longer than ordinary cold medicine.
[94:46.80]There's a whole day's work in every contact.
[94:50.46]Eight hours and 30 seconds.
[94:51.89]Look, if you're gonna time the tiny time pills all day, when are you gonna do the work?
[94:56.11]Right.
[94:57.31]You time it.
[94:59.03]There's a whole day's work in every contact.
[95:00.79]What did he close?
[95:02.81]You're going to time the tiny time pill.
[95:05.11]Wait, what hurt him?
[95:07.23]Right.
[95:08.43]You time.
[95:08.79]Oh, his hand.
[95:11.63]Coming to ABC.
[95:13.91]I saw his hand up and both hands in the air.
[95:15.97]No way.
[95:16.55]Two years tops.
[95:17.37]Three.
[95:17.83]Two and a half.
[95:18.47]Three are no deal.
[95:19.14]Done.
[95:19.76]He put both his hands up and then he closed the draw.
[95:22.12]Was that his stomach?
[95:23.80]You said you took on the cases nobody else wanted.
[95:27.96]How the hell are we supposed to win a case without witnesses?
[95:31.32]Fail denied.
[95:31.94]Oh, your honor.
[95:34.16]We got a big problem here.
[95:35.56]Treat Williams.
[95:36.76]You mean you're a real lawyer?
[95:38.36]Surprise.
[95:39.28]Eddie Dodd, premiering this week on ABC TV.
[95:41.75]Oh, that'll fix the case.
[95:44.83]We got a problem here.
[95:47.41]Uh, yeah, um... The sentence is final, by the way.
[95:51.35]Lifetime.
[95:52.19]No wonder many of us seem to always... Big Bell calling card.
[95:56.31]You can easily charge calls, wherever you are.
[96:00.17]Whether you're just down the street or somewhere up the coast.
[96:05.16]But unlike most calling cards, Pacific Bell is based on your own familiar phone number.
[96:11.74]And since it's welcome at most every phone, it's really the only calling card you need to hang on to.
[96:18.15]Pacific Bell.
[96:19.59]We're making things easier, everywhere.
[96:26.43]50 years, oh.
[96:27.59]McDonald's explodes another myth.
[96:29.72]If it's low fat, it can't be delicious.
[96:32.74]Not so.
[96:33.66]Introducing McLean Deluxe, made with a 91% fat-free beef patty.

[101:47.29]Who's the boss?
[101:48.39]And at a special time, Ned Beatty guest stars.
[101:51.11]That's a chemistry set.
[101:52.23]Every boy should have one.
[101:53.65]No, you shouldn't have done that, Ed.
[101:55.12]We could just turn on the gas and blow ourselves up.
[101:57.76]An hour of Roseanne.
[101:59.26]Ed.
[101:59.74]I flew here this morning from Colombia.
[102:01.40]A dope smuggler swallows his stash.
[102:03.40]If somebody dies, it's not your fault, is it?
[102:05.50]No, not totally.
[102:07.14]What percentage would you say?
[102:08.54]Stat Tuesday.
[102:10.81]What?

[102:13.95]What?
[102:15.35]What?
[102:20.53]No, I don't want to see this person get snapped out of existence again.
[102:23.47]Wait, is this a different person?
[102:27.34]This is a different person.
[102:33.55]I just like choked on my spit.
[102:37.17]That was sick.
[102:38.39]I'm telling you, I...
[103:02.36]I see somebody do this, I'm gonna be like... Nice job, nice job dude.
[103:06.08]I was just waiting for that guy to do the stomach thing.
[103:23.92]True.
[103:24.10]True.
[103:24.38]True.
[103:54.03]The average driver puts 12,000 to 13,000 miles a year on a car.
[103:57.85]At Saturn, we knew this.
[104:00.71]Where and how, though, is anyone's guess.
[104:02.33]For sure, we knew people would be taking the new Saturn places and using it in ways you'd never figure or even imagine.
[104:11.97]So we tested it.
[104:13.97]We ran it 6 million miles.
[104:16.19]6 million?
[104:17.43]Sometimes.
[104:17.93]Nowhere.
[104:23.38]Isn't it like 100,000 miles on a car considered to be getting kind of up there?
[104:28.40]Six million?
[104:29.30]I mean, you're going to have to tell her.
[104:31.09]Unpleasant as it might be, it was time to break a heart.
[104:34.53]Would you go with me?
[104:36.35]The Wonder Years.
[104:37.29]Depends on the car.

[104:49.80]Catch all the fun Wednesday.
[104:54.04]What?
[104:54.16]They hate their words.
[104:55.62]Critics are saying McDonald's new McLean Deluxe is revolutionary.
[104:59.36]That's because it's made with the leanest beef patty in the business.
[105:01.88]91% fat free.
[105:02.68]They're talking about me.
[105:03.64]They're calling it phenomenal.
[105:05.48]That's because it tastes fantastic.
[105:07.36]The public demanded McDonald's responded with great burger taste and a lot less fat.
[105:12.14]But don't fill up on the press.
[105:13.68]Taste for yourself.
[105:14.92]One bite and you'll be talking about it too.
[105:16.34]I wonder what this tasted like.
[105:17.24]To swallow first, new McLean Deluxe.
[105:19.52]After billions and billions, another first at McDonald's today.
[105:22.60]What did that taste like?
[105:24.67]Bradley decided to express his artistic talents on the living room wall.
[105:30.08]Glidden will cover it in one coat.
[105:31.94]They're so cute at that age.
[105:32.52]That's so much of one brand of paint.
[105:35.36]Of one color of paint.
[105:36.62]Are you sure you have everything?
[105:38.23]Yeah.
[105:39.15]Turn around.
[105:41.05]I got the Fuji film while you were in cosmetics.
[105:43.85]I didn't forget.
[105:44.95]Oh.
[105:45.19]You forgot you married the perfect husband.
[105:46.93]You were right, Dad.
[105:48.05]Kmart's pretty cool.
[105:49.21]You should listen to me more often.
[105:51.66]Wait, hold on.
[105:53.00]Oh, it's not for the cane.
[105:55.26]It's individual candid conversations caught on camera.
[106:01.24]Bradley decided to express his artistic talents on the living room wall.
[106:07.07]This kind of looks like mac and cheese containers.
[106:10.95]What, is this a real brand?
[106:14.35]Boom mic?
[106:14.77]Hold on, no, no, no, no, no.
[106:15.71]Where?
[106:19.33]Oh shit, where were we?
[106:20.33]Just turn on the gas and blow ourselves up.
[106:23.35]Where was it?
[106:24.17]I don't remember.
[106:25.29]Here it is.
[106:25.69]Oh, is it boom mic?
[106:26.61]Buckets of mac and cheese.
[106:43.82]Bradley decided to express his artistic talent on the living room wall.
[106:49.22]Glidden will cover it in one coat.
[106:51.18]They're so cute at that age.
[106:52.27]You can't get mad at them.
[106:53.55]Wanna bet?
[106:55.73]Are you sure you have everything?
[106:57.09]Yeah, it's right there.
[106:58.31]Turn around.
[106:59.05]I got the Fuji film while you were in cosmetics.
[107:03.02]I didn't forget.
[107:04.36]You forgot you married the perfect husband.
[107:06.08]You were right, Dad.
[107:07.22]Kmart's pretty cool.
[107:08.38]You should listen to me more often.
[107:10.33]No, it would be so much... If another group came by and were like, oh, so cereal tonight?
[107:17.27]Of course, son.
[107:18.13]Yeah, sure.
[107:18.81]Oh, you're filming?
[107:22.39]Oh, they're filming us.
[107:24.52]I feel like that felt... I don't know.
[107:31.88]I just think it's funny.
[107:33.36]Kmart's pretty cool.
[107:34.52]You should listen to me more often.
[107:40.13]Of all pine cleaners, more people choose Pine Sol.
[107:43.19]Pine Sol's got more active ingredients than the next leading brand.
[107:46.38]Does that mean it's better, though?
[107:47.60]There's more stuff in here.
[107:49.56]It's not really clean until it's Pine Solved.
[107:55.30]Friday on Full House, Joey and Jesse get close to nature.
[107:58.46]Staff, yeah.
[107:59.17]Mr. Fine.
[108:04.90]Maybe even a little too close.
[108:07.76]If they get sprayed, I'll laugh.
[108:08.78]Are they going to get sprayed?
[108:10.06]I remember dinosaurs.
[108:25.03]My goodness.
[108:55.29]Royal Caribbean's three and four night cruises from Los Angeles to Mexico.
[108:59.15]The grand resorts that offers so much for so little.
[109:02.07]So why wait?
[109:03.31]This session has the same energy as watching TV with your boomer uncle.
[109:06.90]Welcome.
[109:10.62]Is this your kid?
[109:11.90]And is he drinking the only juice drink with a full day's vitamin C, four other vitamins, and all natural flavors?
[109:17.70]Well, maybe this isn't your kid, but this should be his juice drink.
[109:22.06]Tang Fruit Box.
[109:23.25]Nutrition in disguise.
[109:26.00]Don't care about movie stars who live in Hollywood.
[109:29.29]Don't like the attitude, don't think I ever know.
[109:32.99]Don't want the good taste, I know I taste good.
[109:36.11]That's why the best things always seem misunderstood.
[109:40.17]Just give me what the doctor ordered.
[109:43.47]Just what the doctor ordered.
[109:45.67]Dr. Pepper has been pretty consistent flavor-wise.
[109:50.99]They could have probably pivoted if they wanted to.
[109:54.85]I would consider Dr. Pepper's flavor to be extreme.
[109:58.50]You can't just say you're the best.
[109:59.88]It's kind of extreme.
[110:00.38]You have to prove it.
[110:00.94]You have to perform at the highest level.
[110:02.70]And they probably could have pivoted.
[110:04.88]That's why Century 21 professionals are trained to know their business better.
[110:09.56]Skilled at making everything work together.
[110:12.37]Committed to giving you the highest level of professional service.
[110:17.15]The standard of performance by which all others will be judged.
[110:22.83]Oh, it's like a real mistake.
[110:26.20]I like wearing white, but not under my arm.
[110:28.48]This solid leaves a white flakey mess.
[110:30.68]But now, there's New Arid Sports Scent.
[110:33.38]Solid protection that never turns white or messy.
[110:37.14]New Arid Sports Scent.
[110:38.72]Solid protection without the white mess.
[110:41.69]See this one.
[110:44.31]It might be time to change compilations.
[110:46.77]We've watched this one for an hour.
[110:49.83]This one had some pretty good ones, though.
[110:52.59]We'll get a new compilation.
[110:56.58]Let's give it, like... Let's give it, like, a few more.
[110:59.98]Damn.
[111:01.33]Lost again.
[111:13.73]Kiss me once and kiss me twice and kiss me once again.
[111:19.54]It's been a long, long time.
[111:24.68]What?
[111:25.02]Unlock the magic.
[111:28.46]alright appearing at a Burger King near you a cool new star that's romantic snickers ice cream bar
[111:37.58]Rich milk chocolate, buttery caramel, and fresh roasted peanuts.
[111:43.46]Only a few of these came in a box.
[111:45.98]And my brother used to be so fucking angry with me.
[111:50.54]I would eat three of them at least.
[111:52.12]I think only three or four of them came in a box.
[111:54.68]And I would eat three of them in a row.
[111:57.46]And he would open the box and he would scream at me.
[111:59.75]He'd be like, he'd be like, stop eating all the Snickers ice cream bars!
[112:05.93]And I would just be like, I didn't.
[112:07.73]I didn't.
[112:08.13]It's like, what are you talking about?
[112:10.25]Like, there's literally four in the box.
[112:13.35]We know who's eating them.
[112:17.14]You've told this story before?
[112:18.44]Oh, yeah.
[112:19.42]It would happen every time.
[112:20.62]And that was a treat.
[112:22.34]If there were Snickers ice cream bars in that freezer, I would just eat.
[112:27.70]I would eat them until they were gone.
[112:30.68]And I would only think about how bad I was being after.
[112:36.22]You know what I mean?
[112:37.80]I would eat two or three in a row.
[112:40.21]And I'd be like, that was bad.
[112:41.33]And then it would get, I would get, my brother would just be pissed.
[112:49.67]Does he still do this, Holly?
[112:52.33]Um, yeah, I don't mean to.
[112:55.80]I just like love food.
[113:03.76]I love orange juice and we'll get orange juice.
[113:07.68]It's like, alright, orange juice.
[113:10.12]Just to make sure this is completely clear.
[113:14.28]This is only going to be in the fridge for like maybe two days.
[113:17.12]It's all going to be gone.
[113:19.04]All of it.
[113:19.76]I'll drink the whole thing in like a few days.
[113:22.92]It's bad.
[113:25.28]Orange juice is like one of my favorite things in the world.
[113:27.62]And if it's available to me, it will be gone.
[113:30.94]The apple juice incident?
[113:32.94]Oh, okay.
[113:34.32]So... So... Okay.
[113:42.56]I like kefir.
[113:44.25]It's kind of a yogurt.
[113:45.45]It's like a yogurt champagne.
[113:48.09]And I keep telling her, Oh, you should really drink kefir.
[113:52.73]It's got like probiotics.
[113:53.79]It's really kind of good for you.
[113:55.67]She didn't have an opportunity.
[113:56.56]I drink the whole thing before she gets a sip.
[113:59.20]And I keep saying, why don't you drink some more?
[114:00.72]You should have some kefir.
[114:01.86]It's good.
[114:03.16]And then she'd be like, hey, where's the kefir?
[114:05.32]And I'll go, oh, it's all gone.
[114:06.56]I drank all of it.
[114:15.49]So, I just, if there's orange juice, kefir, or Snickers ice cream bars in that fridge, it's, why is my voice doing that?
[114:30.22]Yeah, I got a special apple juice specifically because it's the, uh, what's the brand?
[114:37.53]It's that brand that's super, everybody loves it, it's super delicious.
[114:41.27]It's a, it's a apple juice brand.
[114:43.97]What is it?
[114:44.35]What is it?
[114:44.61]What is it?
[114:45.82]Yes, Martinelli's.
[114:47.70]So Martinelli's makes this delicious apple juice, and I bought one specifically for her.
[114:53.62]It was a surprise.
[114:54.76]I was like, hey, look what I got for you.
[114:57.77]It's Martinelli's apple juice.
[114:59.21]We love this stuff.
[115:01.51]But I want to make sure the record is correct.
[115:04.93]Yes, so I bought this for her because I wanted to surprise her with lunch.
[115:10.50]And I drank it before... I want to make sure I get the record straight.
[115:14.12]I drank it before she could drink it, even though I specifically was like a surprise for her.
[115:23.34]I remember looking at the bottle and I was like, oh shit, because I drank it.
[115:29.27]And I was like, no, no, I have to replace this.
[115:32.29]I have to replace this.
[115:37.36]She found the empty bottle in like the recycling or something, right?
[115:41.98]And I was like, I'm so sorry.
[115:43.99]It was supposed to be a surprise, but I just was too delicious.
[115:47.51]It was truly, truly a moment.
[115:51.61]But I replaced it and I make sure now that I get double.
[116:02.63]This is alright.
[116:03.69]This has only happened like twice ever.
[116:08.34]Okay.
[116:11.10]She said it was so funny.
[116:19.56]No, twice as in you don't put Snickers ice cream bars in the freezer because I'll eat them all.
[116:25.55]And orange juice.
[116:28.57]You were so sad.
[116:29.85]I really was.
[116:30.53]I was just like...

[117:08.21]pointing at the fridge, and you'll just get me coming down with like a bathrobe on, just like... It's like, oh, at the door, opening it, like sleepy.
[117:26.77]I just don't get it.
[117:29.83]What if I smash it?
[117:32.44]You're hungry.

[117:40.48]That's the classic grizzly bear noise.
[117:44.80]Feed Otto his carrot treat.

[124:28.08]Just put them in.
[124:28.77]Boom.
[124:29.09]They feel great.
[124:29.81]You don't clean them.
[124:31.13]Visit your eye care professional for an exam, and if AccuView is right for you, you'll get a free trial pair.
[124:36.29]That's all it took for me.
[124:37.41]Just to put them on one time.

[125:49.49]I saved a few cents.
[125:50.35]Mom, it's not the cheesiest.

[126:46.55]I'm trying to think of like a washer and dryer combo now.
[126:50.83]It's hot, and it's only linked to Pizza Hut.
[126:53.75]That'll get one new sausage lover's pizza for $8.99, or a second for just four hours more.
[126:57.83]Yeah, that's like at least $500, $600, $700 now at least.
[126:59.76]$1,000 now?
[126:59.96]Yeah.
[127:04.67]You're not leaving until you eat breakfast, so you might as well do it.
[127:09.46]If we've told you once, we've told you a thousand times.
[127:12.82]Have you forgotten everything we taught you?
[127:15.86]A suggestion for all you grown-ups who think there's no time for a hot breakfast.
[127:20.50]Kellogg's Pop-Tarts.
[127:21.62]They will float.
[127:23.86]You like fruit, don't you?
[127:25.66]Now open wide.
[127:28.12]Kellogg's Pop-Tarts.
[127:29.49]The hot breakfast everyone has time for.
[127:32.15]You know you like them.
[127:33.41]Is this back before there was frosting all over?
[127:36.11]I'm Kate Kelly in New Orleans, coming up tonight on Nightcast.
[127:38.54]The power of voodoo.
[127:39.46]There was no frosting on it.
[127:46.50]What is going on?
[127:47.56]What was that?
[127:48.02]What was the audio?
[127:49.38]What was that?
[127:50.06]What?
[127:50.20]Wait, what?
[127:50.60]I'm so confused.
[128:08.50]For years, we've been telling you how the four-wheel drive Subaru helps the U.S.
[128:12.99]ski team get to their events early.
[128:15.61]Yet at the 1989 World Championships, the U.S.
[128:18.81]team was not the first to arrive.
[128:20.76]The Norwegians beat us.
[128:23.38]The French beat us.
[128:24.86]As did the Italians and the Swedes.
[128:27.60]How'd they do it?
[128:29.40]Dude, everybody in this car is screaming.
[128:31.64]Do you understand?
[128:33.36]This is not like a fun trip.
[128:34.90]If this is me in this car, I am screaming.
[128:36.86]Where's the road?
[128:37.38]There's no road.
[128:38.30]We don't know where we are.
[128:39.70]This is I'm screaming.
[128:40.32]Holy shit.
[128:40.76]It was a road?
[128:41.50]I don't know.
[128:42.00]That was kind of scary.
[128:58.99]Imagine a Disneyland as big as the city of San Francisco.
[129:03.75]A Disney World with a surprise around every corner.
[129:08.00]43 square miles of tropical Paradise.
[129:10.96]The spectacular new Disney MGM Studios theme park.
[129:14.96]And the incredible Epcot Center.
[129:19.32]Imagine yourself here.
[129:21.50]Walt Disney World in Florida.
[129:24.07]As big as imagination gets.
[129:26.13]Holy shit, Mickey.
[129:27.29]Be careful up there, dude.
[129:28.97]That was... Whoa.
[129:34.42]You never know where history will unfold, but you always know where to turn.
[129:38.44]I actually... Epcot is... That's cool.
[129:44.32]Gary's being pushed too far.
[129:46.03]If you love me, you must leave me alone.
[129:48.09]His worst nightmare is taking shape.
[129:50.43]My children are gonna be living under the same roof as a rapist.
[129:53.15]His last resort, an act of desperation.
[129:55.29]Speak now, or else forever hold your peace.
[129:57.71]I'm gonna yell, rapist, rapist.
[130:01.23]On Knots Landing, Thursday.

[130:48.32]35th anniversary.
[130:50.67]It's Disneyland Day.
[130:55.48]Instead of sitting there, you could be sitting here.
[130:59.19]In a Mazda MX-6 GT.
[131:01.47]Get one now and you'll also get $750 cash back.
[131:05.43]It's a better value than Toyota Celica.
[131:07.31]The feature Celica doesn't have.
[131:09.09]And a price that's already less.
[131:10.67]So for your MX-6 and an additional $750 cash back.
[131:14.88]This looks kind of nice though, doesn't it?
[131:17.42]This seems actually kind of better.
[131:21.03]Instead of sitting there, you could be sitting... What an unbelievably wonderful afternoon.
[131:27.20]Oh, I could sit here with my cat and enjoy the sun rather than going really fast around tight turns.
[131:36.97]In a car.
[131:38.07]In a Mazda MX-6 GT.
[131:40.33]Get one now and you'll also get $750 cash back.
[131:44.31]It's a better value than Toyota Celica.
[131:47.06]I'm screaming in this car.
[131:48.54]I'm screaming in this car.
[131:50.82]And an additional $750 cash back.
[131:53.62]You know where it's at.
[131:55.84]At your Northern California Mazda dealer now.
[132:04.07]There are very few guarantees in medicine.
[132:07.21]if you have arthritis pain like I do you should know about metaprin and the metaprin guarantee if two metaprin don't really oh yes you can open your eyes now better than two regular aspirin you get your money back strong promise strong medicine the medicine that concentrates the power of ibuprofen into these potent little caplets the medicine that guarantees better relief than regular aspirin better arthritis pain relief that's the metaprin guarantee they know they want to
[132:34.15]You know, there's a certain medicine.
[132:36.82]It's actually kind of remarkable just how well stuff like Tylenol, uh, well, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, um, it's crazy that you can just take this thing, and it's very, very safe, right?
[132:49.92]Like, if you do, if, obviously, if you take this with, you know, as directed, we came up with a way to make it so you just tell your brain that this doesn't hurt anymore.
[133:02.01]That's kind of unbelievable.
[133:06.15]Oh, no, yeah, just take this.
[133:07.97]You've got like a really bad headache.
[133:10.27]Oh, just take this thing and it'll be better soon.
[133:14.93]That's kind of remarkable.
[133:19.95]Ibuprofen Andy.
[133:29.10]What?
[133:31.66]I mean, prof and Andy?
[133:33.10]Alright.
[133:34.78]I mix the pedigree with the pedigree mealtime because the dogs enjoy it.
[133:38.00]It's the perfect combination.
[133:39.26]These are champions.
[133:40.12]They deserve the best.
[133:41.52]Pedigree.
[133:42.46]Recommended by top breeders.
[133:45.67]right now you're just 90 seconds away from chef boyardee with microwave meals chef boyardee pasta hot and tasty and with no messy cleanup chef boyardee microwave meals look like enough thank goodness in just 90 seconds this morning I was following I could probably eat four or five of those I think so trucks all the time it also dawned on me that I hardly ever see a service truck from those so-called super stores
[134:11.48]so before you make that next big buying decision ask yourself what kind of service you'll get five years from now or if they'll even be around to answer the phone that's one of the big reasons I feel better when I buy a major appliance or electronics from sears and that's what they mean by your money's worth we have the same hair we don't not even close it's not even close
[134:41.19]Not even close.
[134:44.25]This looks like something my mom would eat.
[134:46.19]It's kind of quiet, conservative.
[134:50.72]I don't think I can get into this.
[134:52.32]I mean, it's just a bunch of flakes.
[134:56.68]Doesn't taste the way it looks.
[134:58.28]Doubter.
[134:58.62]I like the way it crunches.
[135:01.70]Maybe it's good because it's simple.
[135:04.26]Wait, wait, don't tell me.
[135:05.48]I'm just like my mother.
[135:06.88]Kellogg's Corn Flakes.
[135:08.86]Why would you do that when you can follow your nose to the delicious sugary Froot Loops?
[135:13.28]I hope you'll be with us tonight.
[135:14.28]Dan Miller will be live from New Orleans beside the Super Bowl bringing you updates on goodness knows what along with actress Karen Black and much more.

[135:35.68]'s 60th anniversary celebration.
[135:38.46]Brought to you by Dr. Pepper and your local Dr. Pepper.
[135:42.51]Dr. Pepper is just what the doctor ordered.
[135:45.01]The good time, great taste of McDonald's.
[135:49.93]AT&T, the right choice.
[135:54.35]And Chrysler Corporation and the Chrysler Motors Black Dealers Association.
[136:01.68]What do you like about your Eagle Premier?
[136:04.00]Everything.
[136:04.50]You mean the leather interior and the roominess?
[136:07.35]I said everything.
[136:08.23]So what's Premier got that other cars in his class don't?
[136:10.79]Turbo team.
[136:11.61]Me.
[136:12.29]I will never see a standard red car the same ever again.
[136:16.98]You got it.
[136:17.48]The Taurus and the Cressida?
[136:18.90]You got it.
[136:19.50]Then you tried the Eagle Premier?
[136:21.34]You got it.
[136:21.90]What'd you think?
[136:23.54]I got it.
[136:32.93]Oh, the phone cords that bind, that hold your small business back.
[136:38.10]Now AT&T can set you free with the first cordless phone specifically designed for business.
[136:43.72]The multi-line Merlin cordless.
[136:45.96]This guy's a fucking rug.
[136:48.45]So you don't have to lose any quality to gain your freedom.
[136:53.47]Set your business free.
[136:55.65]Call 1-800-MERLIN-ATT.
[136:57.59]I don't think it's fair to give only one of your workers the Super Mario mushroom.
[137:02.66]You understand?
[137:03.98]Who's left?
[137:05.10]Kane.
[137:06.14]Pitcher Maroon is due up.
[137:07.38]Kane.
[137:07.68]So Burns is going to have to lose bench.
[137:12.16]Only choice is John Kane.
[137:13.32]Hey, kid.
[137:13.70]Get me the doc.
[137:14.54]Burns has been reluctant to use Kane, preferring to go with the younger players, but he may not have a choice here tonight.
[137:19.71]Now betting for Maroon.
[137:20.87]Kane.
[137:21.17]Kane.
[137:31.82]Oh, it's Dr. Pepper.
[137:33.20]This is Hubert Strauss, Austrian downhill racer and Olympic gold medalist.
[137:39.05]He's not afraid of extreme vertical drops.
[137:42.58]He's not afraid of speeds over 90 miles an hour.
[137:45.92]He's not afraid of anything, except going slow.
[137:50.12]But if you think he's tough, wait till you see the guy at the ticket window at the Olympics.
[137:53.98]Isn't that scary?
[137:55.48]Wait, hold on.
[137:56.00]Isn't that, like, scary?
[137:57.14]It's like, he's not afraid?
[137:58.36]This is Hubert Stroess, Austrian downhill racer and Olympic gold medalist.
[138:04.84]He's not afraid of extreme vertical drops.
[138:08.82]He's not afraid of anything.
[138:10.52]He's not afraid of anything.
[138:14.12]Except going slow.
[138:15.92]But if you think he's tough, wait till you see the guys at the ticket window at the Olympics if you don't have your Visa card.
[138:21.51]Because the Olympics don't take American Express.
[138:25.95]Asa, it's everywhere you want to be.
[138:28.99]He really missed you.
[138:30.51]Really.
[138:31.25]You would laugh all night long.
[138:33.94]It was your kind of thing.
[138:35.63]You made me love.
[138:38.45]It was so embarrassing.
[138:39.73]I haven't seen him in here, but it was great.
[138:42.71]He still cracks me up.
[138:43.60]I'll tell you one more time, because I think I liked it.
[138:45.68]I just did that.
[138:46.66]We just did that, yeah.
[138:48.48]No one helps you share the feelings like AT&T Long Distance.
[138:53.22]I wish you could have been here, too.
[138:54.90]Who are they calling?

[173:16.68]One of the best.
[173:17.62]One of the greatest.
[173:19.25]I like kind of pretend that I so my experience with the with the mana series especially secret of mana was renting this game from the store rental place the video game rental and opening up somebody else's save file I believe is what it was walking around not understanding what was going on and then returning it and never playing it again um I just had no idea what's happening I did that a lot though I did that with tons of games
[173:46.85]And it's kind of sad that I probably was just a little too, I don't know, like ADHD and young kind of at the same time where it was just like, oh, somebody already has a save file.
[173:56.72]I don't want to play that.
[173:57.36]I just want to see.
[173:58.24]They already did it.
[173:58.84]I want to do it.
[173:59.88]And just don't understand what's going on.
[174:01.68]I really wish I actually played through some of these.
[174:07.09]Because I feel like these are like some of the most incredible old experiences.
[174:13.27]And I just skipped all of it.
[174:17.31]And just played on somebody else's save file for an hour and then it went back to storms.
[174:22.10]Hey Ralph, want my burger and fries?
[174:24.32]Ralph, it's Batman!
