[00:09.04]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.72]J-ho, everybody!
[00:12.62]Let me walk out of the door and, like, explode first.
[00:16.73]Hey, what's going on, guys?
[00:17.71]Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, Saturday's edition.
[00:21.93]Hope you're having a fantastic Saturday afternoon.
[00:26.11]Cause Saturday afternoon, and your eyes are the size of the moon.
[00:31.42]That's not the lyrics of that song.
[00:33.78]But, what was that group's name?
[00:37.46]Oh, God, they're the ones that were...
[00:39.46]I chimed in, da-da-da-da-da-da, haven't you heard of?
[00:42.54]Da-da-da-ba-ba-ba, like, oh, what is, I can't, Panic at the Disco.
[00:47.66]They had, like, two songs that were famous.
[00:50.07]Or maybe even one.
[00:50.89]I'm probably thinking of two completely different bands.
[00:53.13]But anyways, let's play some Pyro on Upward.
[00:57.01]Upward.
[00:57.69]I think we're about to change the bad water, I hope not.
[01:00.79]Because I just wanted to play Upward.
[01:05.34]Mmm, delicious.
[01:08.02]Oh, that's a coffee, by the way.
[01:09.30]It's just gonna turn into a coffee.
[01:12.44]Probably not, though.
[01:13.16]It's only one.
[01:14.26]I haven't even drank.
[01:14.88]It's like that much gone.
[01:17.24]Setup time.
[01:17.96]I've just been talking this whole time through setup time.
[01:20.07]Let's just, like, teleport to, like, the beginning.
[01:22.53]The beauty of time travel.
[01:24.21]Let's do it, baby.
[01:26.01]Oh, you are our spy.
[01:26.87]Get out of my face.
[01:30.07]That took a long time to show up in the kill feed.
[01:34.09]Alright, this heavy.
[01:35.92]This heavy is dead.
[01:39.12]I'm going to come out the corner, turn around, and he's going to get smashed.
[01:46.23]Everybody on the cart.
[01:47.81]Get on the cart, gentlemen.
[01:50.45]That is by for sure... No, it's not.
[01:55.04]There's a sniper right there, though.
[01:56.50]He's trying to pick me off.
[01:59.44]Where are you going?
[02:00.42]Where are you going, bro?
[02:01.18]Alright, two heavy.
[02:02.90]We've got two cart heavies.
[02:03.86]We're going to be good.
[02:06.39]Yeah, I'm just gonna... Yeah, right.
[02:08.22]Wow.
[02:09.06]A lot of these guys are the biggest spies.
[02:10.38]They're just not spies.
[02:12.30]Where's the enemy team?
[02:14.38]Oh, dear goodness.
[02:16.54]There, he's still alive.
[02:17.46]Yeah.
[02:18.02]I don't think so.
[02:19.36]I don't think so, dude.
[02:21.76]Maybe he does think so.
[02:25.98]Oh!
[02:27.40]No!
[02:29.54]What am I doing?
[02:30.26]What a terrible shot that was.
[02:31.46]I got caught up on my cord.
[02:32.64]That would've killed him.
[02:35.08]I like tried to turn my mouse and my hand went like... It's alright, we're good.
[02:41.11]We got this, we got this.
[02:45.23]That pyro... I got the home wrecker on.
[02:48.44]Whoa, whoa, lag.
[02:49.36]Oh, how am I supposed to fight this battle?
[02:53.86]I know how to fight THIS battle, though!
[02:57.40]Gotta sneak around the back, sneak around the back.
[02:59.51]Sniper, you are getting lit.
[03:02.52]And then you're gonna get, what, what do you get backstabbed or something?
[03:06.00]Ooh.
[03:07.40]I'll, oh, here comes the dance.
[03:08.78]Here comes the dance of dragons.
[03:11.76]Dance of dragons.
[03:14.36]Oh!
[03:16.31]Is this guy's... Come on, this guy needs to die.
[03:19.01]Oh my god.
[03:21.55]How is, that guy was just unloading on everybody and nobody attacked him.
[03:28.52]Come on, dudes.
[03:29.46]He's just like hiding in the corner.
[03:34.22]Somebody kill that damn heavy.
[03:35.60]I think somebody got him.
[03:38.22]Good job, dudes.
[03:42.84]Oh no, somebody, he's still alive!
[03:44.40]Oh my goodness, that guy was like a spy heavy, just sitting in the corner.
[03:56.79]Oh, don't you dare.
[03:58.73]Don't you freaking dare.
[04:02.39]Oh!
[04:06.31]Me and this guy got this on the lockdown, baby.
[04:10.35]Oh, I wish I got him with that.
[04:12.95]I got him with that, though.
[04:15.08]Oh, snuck your head out there.
[04:16.70]Not a good idea, baby.
[04:22.32]Oh, that's how you get some shots laid down.
[04:25.64]Any sentry over here?
[04:27.26]I'm definitely gonna drop down and just die.
[04:31.65]Oh, dear goodness.
[04:33.65]No, no, no.
[04:34.85]No!
[04:35.05]No!
[04:37.33]Oh, no!
[04:47.30]Oh, that was bad.
[04:48.34]I had a... Oh, well.
[04:53.96]Let's just get back to it.
[04:57.27]Five minutes left in the mission.
[04:59.29]Five minutes left in the mission.
[05:05.71]Where do you think you're going?
[05:07.60]Where do you... Where'd he go?
[05:10.74]What?
[05:10.98]That guy was a slippery bastard.
[05:13.82]Where the hell did he go?
[05:16.24]No, you killed my friend.
[05:17.80]What?
[05:18.76]Oh my god, that guy just like freaked me out.
[05:21.88]Oh, knock him over the whole gate.
[05:24.88]Oh god, I'm out of ammo.
[05:27.60]Oh, he's gonna get home wrecked.
[05:29.64]That's his fate.
[05:30.83]Oh, no, he's not.
[05:31.49]He's got the freaking crits.
[05:32.87]See you later.
[05:35.85]Oh, god, stop lagging.
[05:37.41]I keep, like, glitching out.
[05:39.15]Ugh, stop it.
[05:41.69]You know, we're going all the way back to spawn.
[05:44.15]I don't think we're going to win this.
[05:46.71]Something tells me that this is not gonna ca- Oh, my god, you have that thing.
[05:54.06]The Beggar's Bazooka.
[05:58.60]Oh, get away from me!
[06:00.94]No!
[06:03.04]I used to do that with my chocolate milk, and one time I did that, and I almost puked all over the dinner table, because I... How?
[06:15.69]How is this even happening right now?
[06:18.62]I'll explain why I almost puked in one second.
[06:21.60]No, don't burn to death!
[06:24.71]on this this is intense moment here we got to push this car up okay now I'll tell you so when I was little I used to do that all the time and my brother used to try and make me laugh when I did it so one day I think I was like 11 or 12 or something I don't remember but I did this I was going and my brother told a joke and I sucked in as I was like I was like blowing out and then I went and I literally almost threw up all over like the turkey dinner we were having it was pretty ridiculous
[06:54.66]Okay guys, well I just got back from a crash, oh my god.
[06:58.16]And, uh, I'm gonna, trying to play Upward Again, I had to change, so... Oh my god, dude, how many centuries are up there?
[07:07.02]Hold on a second.
[07:09.08]Dude, what is, why is there, there were three centuries up here.
[07:13.65]You guys are out of your minds.
[07:16.07]Oh my god, no, what are you doing?
[07:18.47]Alright, well that's, that's the one way to defend a point.
[07:24.88]I don't think, unless they... Jeez Louise, with a piece of cheese.
[07:31.09]So yeah, I just came back from a crash.
[07:34.61]Happens sometimes when I record the facecam and the game at the same time.
[07:39.92]So hopefully it doesn't happen again.
[07:41.70]Hopefully I get this next few minutes of pure, uninterrupted Team Fortress 2 goodness.
[07:47.20]And I change to the medic.
[07:49.30]And let's do, uh, let's get an Uber going here.
[07:51.19]Let's smoke... Oh my god.

[07:57.17]Oh, I just... What's happening here?
[07:59.87]Back it up.
[08:00.91]Back it up, my friend.
[08:02.03]There's no way they're taking any of that out.
[08:06.07]Not even... Had to use it.
[08:08.24]We were dead.
[08:09.62]We were dead.
[08:11.46]I'm just standing behind him.
[08:12.56]Hi!
[08:12.88]Oh no, dude, come...

[08:46.29]Gotta get in a good position.
[08:47.79]I'm just gonna get backstabbed.
[08:51.97]Oh, this heavy.
[08:52.51]He has no idea what's going to happen.
[08:54.25]I'm going to turn and just unload.
[08:57.73]Didn't kill anybody.
[08:58.69]I'll kill this guy, though.
[08:59.53]This guy's going to know what I... Yeah, go ahead.
[09:00.75]Do it again.
[09:01.59]Do it again.
[09:02.01]Come on.
[09:03.71]He didn't do it again.
[09:07.22]Oh, boy.
[09:08.18]I need health.
[09:10.90]Why do I have these equipped?
[09:15.46]No, no.
[09:16.16]That's the end of the line for me.
[09:18.48]Come on.
[09:18.82]Keep it up.
[09:19.28]Keep up the D.
[09:22.05]Keep up the heavy D. Two and a half minutes, we got this.
[09:26.59]Let me take off this, though.
[09:28.01]I'm gonna put on a regular minigun.
[09:30.33]And the Gloves of Running Urgently.
[09:33.79]The Gloves of Running Urgently.
[09:37.19]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[09:40.47]Alrighty then.

[09:47.11]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[09:51.04]Get the medic.
[09:51.74]Just kill the medic.
[09:52.80]And the sniper.
[09:53.82]And the soldier.
[09:54.38]Oh, just eat the sandwich.
[09:59.90]What a bad place to eat that sandwich.
[10:04.76]Thank God for that spy.
[10:06.26]Thank you, spy.
[10:06.94]You just saved us all.
[10:09.82]That spy.
[10:10.48]Just get out of here.
[10:11.78]I'm going up top.
[10:17.38]Going up top to deal with the rats in the vent.
[10:28.21]Oh, this is the moment of truth right here.
[10:29.59]I'm gonna get a million people in my face.
[10:33.89]Ooh, sneaky.
[10:35.73]Sneaky!
[10:36.47]That guy's gonna headshot me.
[10:41.36]I gotta get back.
[10:41.94]They're gonna get on the... Kill him!
[10:47.60]Kill him!
[10:48.98]Kill him.
[10:51.00]On fire.
[10:55.15]No!
[10:55.79]No!
[10:57.63]If I had made it around and hid under those stairs, he would not have seen me.
[11:01.23]That would have been so awesome.
[11:02.27]They're going to cap it.
[11:05.81]They're going to get it.
[11:06.49]Don't let them get it.
[11:08.95]Don't let them get it, boys.
[11:11.53]And or girls.
[11:14.11]Alright.

[11:18.33]This is going to be the final push.
[11:19.79]Here they come!
[11:24.18]I'm, like, being so, like, concerned right now.
[11:26.01]I'm just like, okay, I gotta, like, stay around this side.
[11:31.29]Get rid of this guy!
[11:33.59]Oh, yes!
[11:34.95]Yes!
[11:36.17]Feel the power of the uber-heavy!
[11:38.91]Oh!

[11:45.55]Oh, man.
[11:47.55]Oh, man.
[11:48.27]Oh, jeez louise.
[11:55.78]Are we going to win?
[11:57.90]That's how you win right there.
[12:00.36]And they can't even get out of here.
[12:01.58]Come on out.
[12:02.44]Come on out, boys and girls.
[12:07.93]41 points, though, because I was playing Medic before.
[12:10.61]Alright.
[12:11.85]Well, guys, that's going to wrap it up here.
[12:13.49]Thank you so much for watching.
[12:14.55]Really do appreciate it.
[12:15.86]And can I make it off?
[12:16.52]Can I jump it off?
[12:17.12]Can I jump off the cliff?
[12:17.82]Quick, quick.
[12:18.18]Come on.
[12:18.46]Come on.
