[00:46.66]Welcome back everybody to Withering Sunday.
[00:49.53]How are you?
[00:51.88]What's up?
[01:02.05]If you don't know, this is every Sunday we play Withering Rooms, a new playthrough.
[01:08.23]And I never finish a playthrough.
[01:10.94]We just start a new one.
[01:14.50]So I know people have been, I've seen some complaints about, hey, I would love to see like anything but the first four or five hours of the game.
[01:21.88]And I get that criticism, but it's just the way that we've done things for many, many years.
[01:30.92]And I thought maybe should I just maybe start, like start halfway through the game?
[01:37.02]And that's what we're going to do today.
[01:39.13]So I've taken the criticism.
[01:47.86]How are you today?
[01:48.45]Hey, how are you today?
[01:49.50]I'm doing good.
[01:51.71]Not great.
[01:53.58]Not great.
[01:54.94]Let's not get that twisted up a little bit here.
[01:57.57]I'm doing good.
[01:59.48]Not great.
[02:04.10]Would you have for lunch today?
[02:09.67]Burrito.
[02:18.14]breakfast burrito it was delish that was a long pause I was reading people
[02:36.88]Some people have God on Sundays.
[02:39.46]I have JeremyJerma985 and VinnyVinesauce.
[02:48.87]Well, I mean, Vinny's Sunday streams are always great.
[02:55.92]They're very, very good.
[03:05.12]When will I have a dream of you?
[03:06.60]I don't know.
[03:09.86]Go eat a banana.
[03:12.12]Right?
[03:13.25]Go eat a banana.
[03:15.51]Anyways.
[03:19.86]Am I gonna ever wear a wig?
[03:24.15]Why would I wear a wig when I've got this hair?
[03:30.65]You want me to put this under a wig?
[03:34.19]Have you gone mad?
[03:43.39]This hair is still here.
[03:51.22]Dude, I'm just gonna show up bald one day, turn the camera on, just do the thing that they do in Mad Max, just spray my face with the fucking drug stuff, whatever it is, and be like,
[04:13.83]You know what?
[04:14.59]Okay, I've never actually seen that movie start to finish.
[04:18.23]That's like a spray drug, right?
[04:23.50]Yeah.
[04:27.37]Is it just paint?
[04:29.40]It's just spray paint?
[04:30.50]Oh, I thought it was like a drug.
[04:33.29]I thought it was like a spray paint drug.
[04:34.85]Like, look at this is crazy.
[04:35.80]We like fucking spray this in our faces, like huff it.
[04:39.31]I thought that's what it was.
[04:40.21]I've never seen the whole movie.
[04:43.01]It's just spray paint.
[04:49.17]I thought it was like a spray drug thing.
[04:53.99]It gives a drug effect.
[05:00.04]And they go like, here we go!
[05:01.58]Everybody take a look at me!
[05:04.64]Right?
[05:12.02]I know that's like a lot of people like people love that movie.
[05:15.64]It's a great movie.
[05:16.65]Don't get me wrong.
[05:23.49]Why have you not...
[05:24.32]Okay, I've watched the first third of it.
[05:30.28]I have not seen the whole thing, though.
[05:35.95]It's a great movie, but you haven't seen it.
[05:38.94]I saw the first...
[05:39.73]I know a great movie in the first third of it.
[05:42.24]If I...
[05:42.91]I can tell.
[05:45.36]I got like 30-40 minutes in and I said, damn, this is a great movie.
[05:49.80]And then I fell asleep.
[05:51.58]Not because the movie did that.
[05:53.51]Because I was very tired that night.
[05:56.99]But while I was falling asleep, I remember I was like, man, this is a great fucking movie.
[06:09.22]So I always have that now.
[06:10.85]I always can, whenever I want, I can finish that movie.
[06:23.25]What movie?
[06:23.91]Mad Max.
[06:25.02]Oh wait, a bunch of people just got here.
[06:30.25]That's funny when you're in the middle of talking about a movie, and then somebody says, hey, what movie are you talking about?
[06:46.57]Movie theater should have a one hour break in the middle so you can nap.
[06:50.81]No, I disagree with that take.
[06:55.24]That would make going to the movies like a four hour experience.
[06:58.72]Maybe even five hour experience, depending on how long it is.
[07:04.57]I thought you were streaming late today.
[07:06.41]I was going to stream late today.
[07:09.96]I think eventually maybe I want to do some more late night streams.
[07:12.17]I think those are fun.
[07:13.56]The problem is I woke up
[07:15.24]incredibly early.
[07:18.53]I got up at like 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning today.
[07:20.46]I was like, oh, it's like 4.30.
[07:22.61]Couldn't really go back to sleep.
[07:24.01]I was like, ah, alright.
[07:25.20]So I feel like I'm kind of around now.
[07:31.81]Those are old man waking hours?
[07:33.25]Yeah.
[07:36.37]That keeps happening to me?
[07:38.64]Yeah.
[07:41.38]Waking up early.
[07:44.85]So we're going either really early or really late from pretty much from now on, I would say.
[07:49.43]And less like if there's, you know, playing games with friends or something and it's like, oh, we should, let's do this at three o'clock Pacific.
[07:55.08]You should expect a lot of later night streams and potentially early like this.
[08:01.03]More so later, I'd say, in the future.
[08:05.90]But today, we're going to be continuing our Withering Rooms playthrough.
[08:13.05]It's been like a week or so since we saw this.
[08:24.51]What was the last thing we did?
[08:25.91]Are you guys ready?
[08:27.54]I mean, I cannot go forward until I get a confirmation of yes, I am ready.
[08:32.98]I need at least 60% has to say, yes, I am ready to please begin the live stream.
[08:53.99]Huh.
[08:55.52]Well, that was weird.
[08:57.65]My internet... You know what's weird?
[09:00.04]It doesn't say I have any dropped frames.
[09:06.29]It just says drop frame zero.
[09:08.15]Usually when that happens.
[09:08.91]Well, I don't know.
[09:14.90]If that's on my end, then typically it would be, I'd say drop frames, but I don't.
[09:19.94]But okay, we're here, I guess.
[09:25.04]Maybe that was a Twitch server problem.
[09:26.89]Seems like it.
[09:33.66]But yeah, I am, okay, I just freaked out for a second.
[09:35.50]I took a sip out of my coffee and I was, it tasted weird.
[09:39.32]I usually drink my coffee black, but I put a little bit of sweetener in it today.
[09:43.15]And I just took a sip and I said, that is not, what is this?
[09:46.13]I thought it was old.
[09:51.87]Oh, that's actually kind of nice.
[09:57.96]It is old.
[09:58.65]Alright, are we good?
[10:00.66]I think we have my internet.
[10:01.71]We're good?
[10:02.09]Yeah, it wasn't my internet.
[10:03.08]It was the server.
[10:07.41]Let's get that good, smooth music on.
[10:12.11]Alright, so the last thing that happened... ...was...
[10:20.34]Right, okay, we have the Wretch King gave us the thing.
[10:24.97]The Advanced Wretch spell.
[10:28.84]So we got to go out to the east.
[10:32.65]Find the source of the bells to the far east.
[10:36.62]You faked killing that witch.
[10:37.79]Yeah, we faked killing the witch.
[10:39.14]We pretended to bring it back to the Wretch King.
[10:41.01]Wretch King said...
[10:42.67]Nice work.
[10:44.86]I got something else for you to do out east.
[10:47.29]And he gave us a thing that go out east.
[10:50.50]Which would be... Frog in the Throat.
[10:55.78]out here this way right east stairwell we go out here rear house entrance
[11:02.97]Alright.
[11:03.71]Is there anything that I did?
[11:04.49]I guess I didn't explore up here, but this place is pretty scary and dangerous, so I don't think I'm gonna.
[11:09.14]Hey, speak up.
[11:09.63]I can't hear you over my hair dryer.
[11:17.26]How did you type that?
[11:18.72]Liar.
[11:20.59]You put your hair dryer down in the middle of having wet hair and typed that?
[11:25.29]Lies.
[11:27.87]Alright, what do I got for items?
[11:28.78]I got...
[11:31.11]Okay, I buy that this is a ranged playthrough.
[11:35.19]Um...
[11:37.07]I kind of need way more shit.
[11:39.48]Hold on.
[11:44.17]Get that shield.
[11:47.55]I want to craft some bullets because I know I'm going to need it.
[11:50.08]So where was that?
[11:51.97]It was the upper...
[11:55.40]Where was it?
[11:58.89]Not upper balcony.
[12:00.32]Not attic prison.
[12:03.85]Strange bedroom?
[12:07.83]No, workshop.
[12:08.40]I think it's a workshop.
[12:10.22]Alright, let's go.
[12:15.73]I have to craft some ammo.
[12:19.83]He cannot come with me, so we're good.
[12:31.53]Oh, fuck!
[12:32.99]That actually scared me, because I looked over a chat for a second and then I heard that sound.
[12:43.17]Alright, can I make bullets?
[12:45.73]I can buy some.
[12:46.64]Alright, I need them.
[12:50.46]I need gunpowder.
[12:52.47]Maybe I should reset the day so I can farm for some bullets.
[12:57.81]We'll see.
[12:58.57]We'll see if I need to.
[13:10.03]What the fuck?
[13:12.95]Hey, can you speak?
[13:14.49]The person's name was...
[13:16.50]I drink plain milk six.
[13:21.22]That's a weird username because there are five other people that had that in front of you.
[13:38.05]Now, that was a person that asked you to speak up over the hairdryer.
[13:50.69]Alright, dispel.
[13:54.25]The magic has been dispelled.
[13:59.11]Alright, we're at Crucifixion Row.
[14:01.83]This is a boss.
[14:02.47]Do I have enough to fight whatever's over here?
[14:06.36]I think I'm fine.
[14:08.30]If I'm not fine then I'll go back and farm.
[14:13.84]The Grave Rider.
[14:15.24]Trash Pasha, I sentence you.
[14:17.51]As Christ was nailed to a cross, so shall you be.
[14:21.91]Oh my goodness.
[14:24.52]Whoa, he has a gun too.
[14:30.62]Oh my god, dude.
[14:38.93]Oh my gosh.
[14:43.93]He's kicking the... Alright, this guy is obliterating me.
[14:47.37]This is bad.
[14:53.07]Oh my god, there's no iframes either.
[14:59.33]Okay, this guy's killing me.
[15:00.92]This is a big wall that I'm gonna have to cross here.
[15:03.33]I'm dead.
[15:04.18]Alright, so I need to have a...
[15:06.15]Hold on a minute.
[15:10.52]I need to get the pattern down.
[15:11.67]I think I can kill him without going to do any farming.
[15:20.66]How far do I need to run?
[15:22.51]Okay, he misses the shot if I... Fuck.
[15:28.99]I'm just reloading in front of him.
[15:33.83]Oh my God.
[15:34.91]Hold on.
[15:39.37]Am I under leveled for this or something?
[15:43.02]He's kind of destroying me.
[15:45.08]What about poison?
[15:48.92]What is he weak to?
[15:55.80]No!
[15:57.60]Do I have any heals?
[16:02.01]I have so much food.
[16:03.19]Okay, maybe I might be fine.
[16:04.98]Look, I have a ton of tonics.
[16:07.55]Why is this not on my bar?
[16:15.59]But I have rotten meat on here, but not the other actual food.
[16:28.86]Hold on.
[16:32.07]Okay, now let's go.
[16:33.19]Oh no, please, please, please.
[16:38.37]Oh my god, he's just comboing me.
[16:45.84]I'm dead.
[16:54.98]Did I hit him?
[16:55.96]I got him.
[17:04.24]Tonic.
[17:08.19]It's fine.
[17:08.75]As long as I can eat the damage in it and still win, I'm alright.
[17:14.60]Alright, I am hitting him with this.
[17:16.93]No more bullets in that gun.
[17:19.48]Cheese?
[17:32.54]He's almost dead, this is not a problem.
[17:46.30]Just, I have tons of heals.
[17:47.92]Yeah, I could eat all this damage.
[17:48.97]It's fine.
[17:51.71]I actually might lose.
[17:52.47]Wait.
[18:02.38]No!
[18:02.80]Don't kill me, please.
[18:03.98]I don't want to do it again.
[18:08.74]No!
[18:09.17]No!
[18:09.41]No!
[18:11.54]Oh, okay.
[18:12.96]How many shots do I have?
[18:13.79]One?
[18:16.52]I have to hit him with the fucking stick now.
[18:19.55]But it's okay.
[18:20.92]I prepared for this before the stream ended last time, remember?
[18:27.40]I know that's not your dog.
[18:30.39]I know somebody thought that was their dog last time.
[18:31.92]It's not.
[18:36.23]Okay.
[18:37.79]What do I even have for... Do I have a melee weapon?
[18:41.92]I have the sword.
[18:42.73]I have...
[18:44.65]Okay, I got acid.
[18:48.40]He just gave me necrosis.
[18:51.71]Oh!
[18:58.99]It blows up in my face every time.
[19:04.84]If I lose here, I'm gonna be pissed, actually.
[19:11.78]Whatever, I'll just hurt myself.
[19:21.52]He's almost dead and then I can be done with this nightmare.
[19:24.78]He's dead.
[19:25.20]Alright.
[19:27.69]That fight was a piece of shit.
[19:32.24]Alright, ancient blood organ.
[19:33.76]Ooh, five organ grease?
[19:39.73]You killed the horse too?
[19:42.55]They were part of the same soul.
[19:47.47]Holy shit, I got $54.
[19:56.38]What does Necrosis do?
[20:08.62]So the offering list, what does it do?
[20:18.49]Don't I have like a list of bad things that happened to you?
[20:21.02]Or is it?
[20:29.32]It permanently lowers your max health.
[20:30.93]Oh, okay.
[20:33.90]Good.
[20:34.02]Thank you.
[20:38.46]Alright, well, let's go.
[20:41.74]I'd like to buy some stuff if I could.
[20:45.44]Am I still dressed like a nurse?
[20:48.15]Yeah, get all this off.
[20:48.85]I don't need to wear this right now.
[20:53.79]Max health.
[21:00.13]Where's the one that does damage?
[21:01.49]This one here, right?
[21:02.23]Alright, here we go.
[21:02.78]Projectile damage.
[21:06.11]What are my rings like right now?
[21:10.08]This thing, I can never take this off, I don't think.
[21:21.65]You could be dressed like a nurse right now and we would never know.
[21:24.73]That's true.
[21:25.41]I could be.
[21:29.18]But that would be very weird, as to why would I do that and not, like, I just do that?
[21:35.83]That's just my outfit for the day.
[21:42.88]It would be a secret joke.
[21:44.61]A secret joke for who?
[21:49.99]I think my rings are fine.
[21:56.53]Yeah, that's fine.
[22:02.42]Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
[22:04.80]Oh, good evening.
[22:06.30]I'd introduce myself, but I really can't recall much of anything.
[22:09.65]I'm not even sure how I got here.
[22:12.24]However, one shouldn't let such trivialities bother them, now should they?
[22:19.13]I do have a few photographs in my pocket that I'd like to look at.
[22:22.82]Say, if you got any photographs, I'd happily buy them.
[22:26.26]If you're needing a camera, I can sell one to you as well.
[22:31.62]Alright, let's buy some stuff.
[22:36.92]I do have a bunch of photos.
[22:38.12]Hold on, which ones are the good ones?
[22:39.97]That one's pretty good.
[22:44.44]That one's really good.
[22:46.97]Alright, you can take that one.
[22:47.90]That one's stupid.
[22:50.41]Blood splatter in a coffin.
[22:51.67]Pretty cool, but you can have it.
[22:54.09]Um...
[22:54.81]I don't know what that is.
[22:58.15]That's a scary ghost one, but you can have it.
[23:02.24]This one's crazy.
[23:02.92]I like this one.
[23:04.03]I like these both of these, but you can have them.
[23:15.37]I actually should get a few of these, because I don't have any.
[23:23.44]What about directions?
[23:26.09]To the west lies Mostyn House, said to be a grand and beautiful place.
[23:29.84]Or at least it was.
[23:30.84]Now it's quite run down, I imagine.
[23:32.67]To the east lies St. Eli's Cathedral.
[23:36.00]I occasionally see strange flashes of light emanating from the cemetery out front.
[23:41.01]Finally, down this steep path is the valley.
[23:43.48]There's a set of cottages down there that run along Dewern Brook.
[23:47.49]Deeper in the valley, you'll find
[23:49.48]Twergwad Ruins, the site of an old medieval castle.
[23:54.22]I can see pockets of flame down there.
[23:55.89]Be careful if you visit the valley.
[23:59.06]Alright, we have to do... Where's my quests?
[24:07.27]Alright, find the source of the bell and find a chained witch in the valley.
[24:18.55]Just gonna look over here.
[24:24.73]This is a cemetery.
[24:25.33]There's another candle here.
[24:26.98]This might be a boss.
[24:31.43]Let's just find out.
[24:32.31]If it's a boss, then I'll leave.
[24:34.69]I imagine it probably is.
[24:39.29]Ooh.
[24:40.93]less terror.
[24:45.50]Oh dear, another one.
[24:47.63]You're not the first witch of the Wretch King's spies to arrive at these holy doors.
[24:52.46]The answer remains firm.
[24:53.72]No access to the church.
[24:56.74]There's only one way I will allow you in.
[24:59.01]Okay, well, you are allowed.
[25:01.54]Prove that you are a godly person through righteous combat.
[25:06.09]The Wretch King's undead minions will soon start their knightly attempt to storm the church.
[25:11.71]defended against their attacks and you may enter.
[25:20.60]Oh, right, right, right.
[25:22.05]Okay, okay, okay.
[25:22.92]The raiding party.
[25:26.66]Shit, shoot him.
[25:32.75]I can't hold it.
[25:33.48]I think I have to just time it.
[25:40.47]Mobile game ad?
[25:43.47]Oh my god, he's already here!
[25:54.89]What if they get through?
[25:55.70]I have to fight them if they get through.
[26:00.16]Oh shit, hold on.
[26:03.35]I'm not ready for this.
[26:09.24]So many more people are coming through.
[26:10.76]I'm dead.
[26:11.25]There's no way.
[26:20.80]Shoot it!
[26:22.91]Alright, that's the play.
[26:25.85]If I can live, I might do it.
[26:32.47]Just bait them over here and then shoot them.
[26:41.61]Oh, god damn it.
[26:45.08]Okay, I need a melee weapon in this slot.
[26:48.39]He's throwing something at me as well.
[26:52.55]I love the...
[26:57.50]Okay, shoot.
[27:00.48]I'm almost halfway there.
[27:03.61]Oh my god.
[27:08.49]There's no way I'm gonna be able to kill him from here.
[27:13.19]Oh, he's coming!
[27:18.86]Okay, well, I obviously am gonna have to run.
[27:22.59]Oh, fuck.
[27:24.56]He's too big!
[27:25.20]I can't go by him.
[27:25.92]I have to shoot him.
[27:28.05]He's too big!
[27:33.63]What happens if he gets this close?
[27:37.43]I actually cannot.
[27:38.24]Can I push him?
[27:40.03]I think I have to kill him.
[27:47.86]Actually, the sword is broken.
[27:50.85]Hold on.
[27:55.87]I got Fireball.
[27:57.39]Summon Spears.
[28:02.77]Fuck.
[28:04.39]Kill him!
[28:11.95]He... What is he doing?
[28:13.04]He's freaking out!
[28:13.54]I don't know what I just did, but I got him.
[28:25.27]Alright, we're good.
[28:26.82]He was worth a lot of that bar.
[28:29.75]Alright, do I need to heal or anything?
[28:31.02]I'm good.
[28:38.35]Oh, shit.
[28:39.22]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[28:49.33]Don't move.
[28:51.64]Alright.
[28:51.90]Anybody else?
[28:52.40]Is that it?
[28:54.13]I just did it.
[28:55.75]I remember that sucked when I did it for the first time.
[29:00.62]That actually was horrible the first time I played this.
[29:04.05]I had flashbacks of it.
[29:05.36]Let's go.
[29:09.77]Okay, well, I didn't even want to technically... Is there a bunch of items?
[29:14.63]I can't loot all the corpses?
[29:16.00]What?
[29:23.96]I thought I just unloaded on this guy I was about to be really sad.
[29:28.45]You indeed have God's favor.
[29:29.91]You may enter St. Eli's Church.
[29:32.32]Additionally, I am in dire need of organ grease to keep my mortal frame from falling apart.
[29:37.29]Perhaps we could trade.
[29:39.60]Oh damn.
[29:43.73]Poise?
[29:54.55]This thing's amazing.
[30:01.54]But we're good.
[30:06.25]St. Eli's Foyer
[30:16.98]I don't want to get too deep here because I think this is higher level.
[30:22.06]But until we need to run, if I die, it's going to be sad because we're going to start the whole day over.
[30:36.96]Sure.
[30:40.75]I think we have a bunch of items I can save.
[30:44.20]Yeah, I have two more I can put in here.
[30:45.37]What do I want?
[30:50.65]This thing's amazing.
[30:54.61]I feel like this thing is amazing too.
[30:59.20]but I should start taking these.
[31:00.53]Yep, definitely that.
[31:03.28]I don't need to remember the pipe anymore, right?
[31:06.38]Or this.
[31:07.89]All these charms I should take?
[31:09.54]Yeah.
[31:14.14]Because these just have to be in your inventory.
[31:15.70]They don't have to do anything else.
[31:19.37]I don't care about the melee one.
[31:20.85]Let's do... Are we luck?
[31:28.88]What was your first character's build?
[31:30.22]It was Magic.
[31:37.14]I don't even have this one equipped.
[31:38.40]What the fuck am I doing?
[31:40.36]Maybe I do.
[31:44.97]I think that's good for now.
[31:47.36]Is that equipped?
[31:47.92]The projectile damage one?
[31:51.60]He doesn't do anything.
[32:00.78]No, it's on.
[32:05.38]Okay.
[32:05.50]Alright, should I keep going further in or should I go the other way?
[32:10.06]I'm going to let you decide.
[32:13.40]You've decided to continue moving forward.
[32:16.43]Ballsy move, chat.
[32:24.98]I'm dead.
[32:32.44]the filthy wretch.
[32:34.35]I followed you and Margaret onto the cable car.
[32:37.62]What a strange future, eh?
[32:39.64]I'm a king?
[32:40.30]Somehow I always thought I'd be more, like, Trajan than Nero.
[32:47.37]Power corrupts, I suppose.
[32:49.46]I came here looking for the source of that annoying bell.
[32:52.87]But the bell has been stolen.
[32:54.87]Have a look off to the east.
[32:57.55]Robert Blackett's Paradise,
[33:01.27]the magical preservative powers of blood writ large.
[33:06.38]A great bloody tower.
[33:13.68]The bell resides at the very top.
[33:16.80]But how do we reach it?
[33:18.77]The only way I can see is through the church, the first which has taken up residence in the main chapel of St. Eli's.
[33:25.41]She seems to have lost her mind, but I'll bet the way to that bloody tower is through her.
[33:35.36]Somebody said, I feel like you've been making fun of being a YouTuber longer than you were a YouTuber.
[33:45.52]There's always time to go back.
[33:55.02]I actually might make some YouTube videos.
[33:57.45]I know I said that like months ago, but I was getting the itch.
[34:02.09]Some things I might want to do.
[34:03.54]I don't know.
[34:04.06]It seems like something fun to do again.
[34:10.70]We'll see.
[34:11.24]I don't know.
[34:14.38]I was getting the itch.
[34:17.21]Because putting together the little four horsemen dinner thing, and even like the macaroni and cheese dog shit thing that I did,
[34:23.15]It's kind of fun just being in the editing program again and being like, oh, right.
[34:27.02]Look at that.
[34:27.42]What's that?
[34:27.92]Raise that level.
[34:28.91]No, I don't think that works there.
[34:38.20]But we'll see.
[34:39.35]I don't know.
[34:40.36]I have no idea.
[34:41.22]My plans are all over the place.
[34:43.49]But it should be fun.
[34:45.83]We'll see.
[34:46.72]Okay, you might just see a video appear out of nowhere.
[34:50.72]And...
[34:51.20]then I might make another one out of nowhere, and then I might make another one.
[34:54.86]Or disregard this entire thing and it never happens.
[34:57.67]You know how it works here.
[34:59.82]But yeah, that sounds like kind of fun.
[35:02.53]I got a little ideas for other little fun things to do too Maybe, maybe not
[35:09.69]Oh, he's such a mystery.
[35:10.76]Oh, he's such an enigma.
[35:11.89]No, no, no.
[35:13.83]I'm just, I just, we'll see.
[35:27.28]Don't forget to subscribe and activate the bell.
[35:31.21]I think the original channel... Did we talk about this?
[35:33.51]That it's almost at a million subscribers?
[35:38.21]Okay, here's the thing.
[35:38.98]If I uploaded a video to the main channel, here's, there's two options here.
[35:43.12]There's two outcomes.
[35:44.39]One is there are hundreds of thousands of people that forgot that they were subscribed to me from 10 years ago.
[35:50.95]and they unsubscribe, so I lose like 100,000 subs.
[35:54.03]That's very possible.
[35:55.44]That's possible, right?
[36:04.54]The other option is...
[36:05.56]I don't know.
[36:08.38]Like, I feel like the option one is the one that's more likely.
[36:15.34]People don't do that.
[36:17.73]People don't forget who you are.
[36:20.65]I don't know.
[36:21.66]It's been a long time, man.
[36:23.04]Like, I think some of you forget how long it actually has been.
[36:28.90]People could have, in the time that I- since I made my first YouTube video, could have had- gotten married and had children.
[36:36.82]And those children could be like adults at some point.
[36:42.05]Like, if you had, like, a four-year-old when I made my first video, that kid's in college.
[36:50.54]That's crazy.
[36:57.51]Thank you.
[37:05.84]Sometimes I see people say, oh, hey, dude, it's crazy.
[37:08.05]I remember watching one of your TF2 videos when I was 12.
[37:11.56]I'm like 25 now and I graduated from college.
[37:14.89]I was like, what the fuck?
[37:17.51]That's been a long time.
[37:28.68]So yeah, people could absolutely forget if they watched like three of my TF2 videos when they were 19, 12 years ago.
[37:50.77]It's kind of dark.
[37:56.15]A person who watched your videos in middle school could potentially be the President of the United States.
[38:06.22]Don't stand under the light!
[38:09.39]Can I steal from this guy?
[38:17.83]Oops!
[38:26.89]Dude, I need more...
[38:27.82]I need more damage.
[38:34.19]Alright, that guy took six bullets.
[38:38.34]Village token.
[38:39.94]A token minted by the king of the valley smells strongly of blood.
[38:43.08]Used by residents of the valley below Moston House as currency.
[38:55.57]Oh, bullets.
[38:57.27]Oh!
[39:00.59]Did I actually not get hit by that?
[39:04.26]Oh, this is not good.
[39:11.71]Poison.
[39:13.93]Poison!
[39:22.23]Oh my god, you just let this guy up from behind!
[39:24.07]What the fuck are you doing?
[39:33.37]I have to kill him with the sword.
[39:35.46]Or the bayonet.
[39:38.63]Pipe is still better.
[39:39.52]How?
[39:47.79]These need to heal for way more.
[39:49.42]I hear somebody else.
[39:53.16]I hear big footsteps, by the way.
[40:02.49]It's okay.
[40:03.40]It's just a farter.
[40:04.67]We're alright.
[40:13.07]My melee sucks so bad.
[40:14.72]I need to craft way more stuff.
[40:19.70]Do you smoke weed out of a big Gandalf pipe?
[40:22.18]I feel like somebody asked that already I've answered that before haven't I
[40:37.07]Moldy cottage.
[40:53.27]I don't wanna go in anything yet because I don't wanna die.
[41:02.65]Oops.
[41:06.50]I can't craft here.
[41:11.38]Well, fine.
[41:21.74]Oh god.
[41:26.05]Do you have a bong the size of a didgeridoo?
[41:28.54]And now I'm poisoned because I read that.
[41:30.69]That guy just ate me.
[41:33.38]Heavy legless zombie.
[41:39.25]A didgeridoo bong.
[41:42.93]That's crazy.
[41:52.53]Make sure I get everything.
[42:05.95]drafty co- somebody's right behind me.
[42:13.33]I need the light back on.
[42:16.26]The Night Mother Remembers.
[42:17.69]No, I'm not using tokens on that.
[42:21.63]Scrap metal.
[42:24.46]Grenades.
[42:26.10]Good.
[42:26.93]Okay.
[42:34.11]Lively cottage.
[42:35.40]Alright, I'm gonna go in this.
[42:43.85]he's too big to fit in here
[42:53.54]Do it again?
[43:04.83]It only worked once but it's fine.
[43:09.73]Should I throw a grenade in the room?
[43:11.11]That's a mistake but whatever I might just do it.
[43:19.09]That's interesting.
[43:23.08]Yeah!
[43:30.76]No, I got to redo my inventory.
[43:40.09]I'll just eat the damage.
[43:43.55]We're fine.
[43:46.75]I have a lot of money though.
[43:53.93]Something's still in here.
[44:02.40]Oh, nice.
[44:07.19]Nice.
[44:08.18]Alright, what if I throw a grenade down there?
[44:12.90]I hear piano music, though.
[44:14.04]There's piano down there.
[44:24.44]How much healing do I have?
[44:25.56]A lot.
[44:26.28]I'm fine.
[44:32.66]Oh.
[44:33.47]Yeah.
[44:35.24]I think this is gambling.
[44:42.45]You, girl, like games?
[44:45.79]Spin wheel, win prize.
[44:47.56]Grand prize today is a weapon upgrade kit.
[44:51.14]What are the rules?
[44:52.32]Land on skull, get nothing.
[44:54.27]Land on gift, get prize.
[44:56.02]land on coin get money back land on two coins get double money back land on crown get grand prize very good
[45:04.59]Land on knife, I cut you and make you bleed.
[45:07.40]Hehe.
[45:09.69]Well?
[45:11.29]How much is it?
[45:12.47]It's 25 regular Chuck E. Cheese tokens.
[45:16.20]That's a lot.
[45:17.50]Let's do it.
[45:26.37]Money!
[45:27.78]Alright, I got my- okay, it's money.
[45:33.99]That means I get to do it again.
[45:40.28]Uh oh.
[45:42.49]I got nothing.
[45:45.88]How much money do I have?
[45:50.12]Where's my money?
[45:50.64]How much money do I have?
[45:54.29]I have $163.
[45:56.10]I can do it two more times.
[45:59.87]Now you have to earn it all back.
[46:01.28]I'm working on it.
[46:08.49]It's literally the same thing it landed on.
[46:10.06]Alright, that was 50 coins.
[46:11.98]Alright, this is 75 coins.
[46:14.57]This is how much I spent on the Family Guy game, and that's alright.
[46:17.60]This is my limit.
[46:21.55]And why wouldn't you spend a little bit more after that?
[46:24.22]You know what I mean?
[46:24.90]Just for fun.
[46:59.91]Okay, you can't do that.
[47:01.65]That doesn't work.
[47:03.38]Am I still bleeding?
[47:16.13]Come on!
[47:16.97]Yes!
[47:17.29]No!
[47:18.02]Are you taking all my money?
[47:22.93]That sucks.
[47:25.02]I guess I'll buy something from you.
[47:26.64]A rat's got in.
[47:29.03]Just kidding, child.
[47:30.46]Anyone with a bit of coin to spare is welcome in David's pub.
[47:34.34]You're a bit young for the good stuff, but I'm sure you'll find something you like.
[47:42.50]I only have... See, now I can't do it because I bought all the MMO.
[47:53.68]See, look, now I got plenty of ammo.
[47:56.95]I'll be back.
[47:58.64]I want that grand prize.
[48:02.84]Too young for alcohol, old enough to buy bullets.
[48:07.29]I didn't really think about that until you just said it.
[48:11.04]Alright, well, I'll be back.
[48:20.74]I get everything in here.
[48:21.49]Alright, we can go on that drafty cottage.
[48:31.68]Is the big guy still out there?
[48:40.17]I'll wait till he passes.
[48:43.24]Hey, at least I got bullets out of that.
[48:49.09]It only cost me 173 coins.
[48:52.67]to get 40 coins worth of bullets.
[49:04.67]Hey, Dev here.
[49:05.39]I recognize this seed.
[49:06.48]You're one spin away from the grand prize.
[49:08.61]Oh, what?
[49:10.38]Are you serious?
[49:23.11]I'm really only one spin away.
[49:24.60]Ooh, a rapier.
[49:43.31]Does it all lead to the same place?
[49:46.10]It doesn't.
[49:54.06]There might be something rotten down here.
[49:55.43]I'm not going to... Eclipt ring.
[50:03.90]Oh my god.
[50:07.83]Look at all the spell damage shit I'm getting.
[50:10.55]You can do 150% more spell damage if I was doing spells right now.
[50:19.90]Oh shit!
[50:21.06]An alien!
[50:28.35]Well, I'm glad you didn't attack.
[50:34.76]More money?
[50:38.61]More fingers?
[50:44.84]More money?
[50:47.61]Poise charm, ooh.
[50:51.81]Nice.
[50:54.88]Alright.
[50:56.55]We got one more room to explore.
[50:57.94]The moldy cottage.
[51:05.09]What sauce would you dip?
[51:07.50]My favorite dipping sauce is probably, uh, I like honey mustard.
[51:11.85]I like sweet and sour.
[51:15.80]I think honey mustard is the best.
[51:17.35]But the problem with honey mustard is there's like 20,000 different ways people make honey mustard.
[51:24.61]Oh, fuck.
[51:25.18]Hold on.
[51:32.54]Shoot!
[51:33.66]Shoot!
[51:35.23]Oh my god.
[51:42.26]I have a lot of these.
[51:53.86]Yeah, you can make it so many different ways that I've actually had kind of bad honey mustard and incredible honey mustard.
[52:02.65]fuck give me some I'm getting so screwed I've had so much melee damage so much spell damage no projectile I've had like two items this whole run
[52:24.60]What does the damage have to do with honey mustard?
[52:30.01]Uh, it does psychological damage to me.
[52:32.48]When I think about bad honey mustard.
[52:37.63]Did I get everything here?
[52:45.06]I might have to be cursed to see the other items.
[52:53.58]Maybe it's that.
[52:56.72]Do I have enough money to spin the wheel?
[53:00.68]Let's go.
[53:08.51]Is it this one or the next one?
[53:10.33]The next one.
[53:28.58]Dude, I've had honey mustard that makes you just want to go like... Do you know what I'm saying?
[53:35.90]I've had honey mustard where you're just like, eh, it's fine.
[53:37.99]Yuck.
[53:43.22]That's a very large range.
[53:47.07]Alright, we're winning all the money back right now.
[53:50.26]Go.
[53:51.43]I have 83 coins.
[53:53.05]Give me something.
[54:00.93]Oh yeah!
[54:02.09]50 coins!
[54:07.50]So now I'm only 50 coins down.
[54:13.62]I want that prize!
[54:23.62]Ow, my stomach.
[54:29.04]Bros.
[54:30.71]Hold on.
[54:32.28]I just, hold on a second.
[54:34.63]I think I have to leave.
[54:35.85]I just, I, I, I, I, I pogged out too hard.
[54:43.79]yeah alright in the hands of an experienced smith can increase the base damage of a weapon doing this to the shotgun 100
[54:54.94]Alright, so now that we did it, we won, we need to do it one more time, just for the road.
[55:10.70]Okay.
[55:13.67]That's...
[55:13.97]I'm done.
[55:19.65]I wish you sold.
[55:21.25]You do sell shotgun.
[55:22.68]I need gunpowder.
[55:24.40]You don't sell gunpowder?
[55:25.39]Oh!
[55:31.92]Oh my god.
[55:32.70]You're just carrying that and you didn't even tell me?
[55:42.14]What?
[55:44.32]Holy shit.
[55:48.62]Alright, so I got 30, 45% here.
[55:51.40]I think 5 or 10 from the outfit.
[55:58.53]We're good.
[56:11.79]I feel like there's something better I can put on.
[56:30.79]Maybe the luck?
[56:33.24]I'll put luck on.
[56:33.87]Why not?
[56:38.52]Alright, well I did it.
[56:40.07]I completed the gambling.
[56:43.07]I know a lot of you thought I was gonna do it one more time.
[56:46.93]and you were wrong.
[56:51.68]Get fucking owned chat member that thinks they know what's gonna happen.
[56:57.27]Dumbass I'm not ready for this yet
[57:09.79]Am I your man, Mr. Dumbass?
[57:14.23]The name is Dumas.
[57:17.93]Is that the best commercial ever?
[57:24.20]I think that might be the greatest advertisement ever made.
[57:34.68]Whatever agency made that ad, I just hope they know that they created the single greatest marketing campaign in the history of America.
[57:47.24]I need a mirror.
[58:02.20]Gotta be erratic with your movements.
[58:05.77]Ruined cottage.
[58:13.70]I remember this place.
[58:22.99]This place is creepy.
[58:30.35]I can't activate it.
[58:33.02]This is the Nightmother Cottage.
[58:34.83]I remember...
[58:35.61]This was weird.
[58:42.62]Ooh.
[58:47.23]That's pretty cool.
[58:58.18]Too bad I'm not doing spells.
[59:00.90]There we go.
[59:02.17]That's what I wanted.
[59:06.87]I have to be cursed.
[59:07.66]Yeah, this place gets really scary when you get cursed if I remember.
[59:16.62]Let's see
[59:26.04]No, something happens here.
[59:27.08]Something weird.
[59:30.63]Oops!
[59:31.82]Oh my god, what have I done?
[59:34.63]No, thank god I had candles.
[59:35.67]I'm fine.
[59:40.89]Is it going to be a Jerm awards this year?
[59:42.47]There is not.
[59:45.09]Hey, but, um, Nim's doing his, uh, awards.
[59:50.37]Channel got nominated for a couple things.
[59:52.08]Uh, Nim's New Year's show.
[59:56.58]And that's always a good time.
[60:07.60]I will not be doing one.
[60:17.81]What about a Christmas stream?
[60:23.05]Stop acting like I know everybody that you know.
[60:35.65]Long pause means he's doing a Christmas event.
[60:37.96]No, long pause means I'm looking over and reading what people are writing for a minute.
[60:47.14]Yeah.
[60:47.47]Nim.
[60:48.46]Can we get a link to Nim's channel please?
[60:52.29]Every year Nim does a like kind of clips award show across all of Twitch.
[60:59.02]and we've actually been nominated here a couple times.
[61:04.62]I think we won two or three years ago for one of the baseball
[61:08.88]um clips very cool and there's a couple things nominated this year as well
[61:20.01]Host a medieval LARPing fair for fans.
[61:23.01]No.
[61:24.29]That's a zero on the list, man.
[61:28.84]That's absolutely not something I want to do.
[61:33.90]I'm not doing that.
[61:35.98]You hate my idea.
[61:37.43]I didn't hate your idea.
[61:38.64]It's just I don't want to do your idea.
[61:41.38]Hatred is a strong word there.
[61:44.01]All I said was, oh, I did call it a zero.
[61:46.44]I called it a zero on my list of priorities.
[61:49.79]I didn't say I hate that.
[61:51.08]I said it's a zero on the priority list.
[61:58.63]Oh my God.
[62:08.51]That guy's going to delete his Twitch account.
[62:09.96]No, he's not.
[62:10.78]He's fine.
[62:11.60]He's probably giggling in his seat right now, knowing that he got me to look over and be like, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[62:23.36]Can I use this anymore?
[62:26.24]I need to upgrade the chamber.
[62:29.75]Okay.
[62:30.64]Time to level up like crazy.
[62:40.81]Oh shit, right, I can, I can, wait, do I have to, can I do the one that's down here?
[62:50.55]Yeah, the categories that this channel is nominated for are best scare moment, I think, and then a creative moment.
[63:01.77]There's a lot of competition in that category, though.
[63:07.42]All great nominees.
[63:14.63]Is there going to be a Best Peter?
[63:17.13]I don't believe so.
[63:26.49]No, I don't.
[63:27.88]I am assuring you there is not.
[63:35.28]Okay.
[63:39.20]Um, I wanna go...
[63:40.57]I need gunpowder.
[63:44.45]Bad.
[63:49.96]But I also want...
[63:55.98]I need to do this too.
[63:58.21]Hold on.
[64:00.17]Do I have the offerings to build upgrade here?
[64:11.35]I do.
[64:11.95]Okay.
[64:12.78]What did I...
[64:13.22]I spent all my money at the fucking casino.
[64:15.20]God damn it.
[64:15.62]Hold on.
[64:24.98]That's a lot of damage.
[64:33.60]I guess I would like to upgrade the armor spell if I could, but I don't think I can.
[64:37.22]Eh.
[64:47.78]Okay, sell.
[64:58.65]Salad bayonet.
[65:00.77]People are gonna freak out that I did that.
[65:14.00]That's a heal.
[65:14.77]It's worth keeping rid of the doll.
[65:19.72]Yeah.
[65:22.76]Eh, I have enough to do it once or twice.
[65:24.77]Okay.
[65:35.60]Yes.
[65:38.28]Yes.
[65:42.82]I need three more blood.
[65:44.98]I can get some blood here.
[65:46.16]You know what?
[65:52.81]I'm going for it.
[65:53.82]Let's get some more blood.
[65:54.52]I want to level up.
[65:58.52]We'll just kill everything here.
[66:00.02]I think I'm high enough level to do this now.
[66:06.84]We'll find out right?
[66:12.09]Get out of the way.
[66:20.05]Maybe I'm not high enough.
[66:20.93]Don't die.
[66:24.39]No, no, no, no, no!
[66:26.40]I'm dead.
[66:28.00]That's bad.
[66:30.07]I lost... No!
[66:30.94]My ring!
[66:31.82]The ring that I just got!
[66:32.62]I didn't... Oh, that's not good.
[66:47.52]No, I want that ring.
[66:54.55]No, I should have saved the ring.
[66:57.28]Oh my god, why did I go to the labyrinth?
[66:59.88]Everything was going so well.
[67:01.13]Fuck.
[67:02.36]Well, I can get it though.
[67:05.12]You can get- Oh, that's not good.
[67:06.59]That stinks.
[67:10.36]That means it's gone forever.
[67:12.49]Unless if you get yourself really cursed,
[67:15.84]little cursed chests appear in places and in there could be an item that you lost.
[67:24.16]I bet I wish I had a didgeridoo bong right now.
[67:27.12]Yeah.
[67:31.77]That labyrinth.
[67:32.74]That's because I have the gun.
[67:33.82]I should have just made shotgun.
[67:35.58]I need gunpowder.
[67:36.38]Alright.
[67:40.33]Well, I'm gonna curse the hell out of myself.
[67:45.54]All my things are gone!
[67:48.90]No!
[67:49.50]I had so many good things!
[67:50.77]Dad, I at least saved these, right?
[67:57.23]the okay thank god remember when I said I should probably save these I'm glad I did
[68:07.09]Damn it, that sucks.
[68:12.28]Well, it is what it is.
[68:15.48]You should open up a cranberry vodka for this.
[68:17.27]Dude, it's like one o'clock in the afternoon.
[68:20.27]It's not time for that yet.
[68:23.22]I do have to get cursed.
[68:25.63]Minus 10 speed, but 30...
[68:27.41]I don't know.
[68:37.30]Come on.
[68:40.31]I had to pick that up.
[68:46.31]If you were hypothetically back at it again, what would you be doing?
[68:53.04]Um...
[68:55.59]doing a cartwheel and hitting a light at the Krispy Kreme.
[69:02.82]Theoretically.
[69:08.36]Do I even have a melee weapon?
[69:12.36]That guy threw a fucking grenade.
[69:15.81]I think he just killed himself.
[69:27.04]I can't believe I lost- I don't care about anything but the 30% ring that I lost.
[69:30.52]That is a- oh my god, don't- look at the mirror.
[69:38.42]I guess you have to die eventually, right?
[69:46.30]Yeah, I was never gonna- I just am so mad that I didn't put it in the remembrance thing.
[69:53.49]I got careless.
[70:01.86]We gotta clear all this.
[70:03.08]I need items.
[70:08.93]Oh my god, look out.
[70:09.65]It's a nun.
[70:16.20]This thing is so deadly!
[70:17.66]Why is it doing so much damage?
[70:22.34]Oh, all my fucking items are gone.
[70:24.64]I'm gonna have to go back to the regular house and do a little bit of farming.
[70:30.24]I'm...
[70:30.92]I am fucked.
[70:33.02]I'm fucked.
[70:35.00]Yep.
[70:41.63]Oh, shut the fuck up!
[70:45.11]No way!
[70:45.79]Am I bleeding?
[70:59.40]Oh, it's a gazette.
[71:02.35]Dr. Robert Blackett, administrator of Mostyn Private Asylum, claims to have found valuable scientific and mathematical papers in the attic of Mostyn House,
[71:12.21]Even stranger, they are purported to be written by a young Priscilla Moffston, daughter of the stately home's original owner before she died in 1874.
[71:23.16]Experts from Oxford and Cambridge admitted the papers must have been written by someone well educated in their respective topics.
[71:30.28]but the new ideas presented within were deemed preposterous.
[71:34.51]One paper goes so far as to claim the esteemed Isaac Newton was mistaken about the mechanics of gravity,
[71:40.69]Another makes a case for our world being constructed not from things, but from processes.
[71:48.73]Regardless of their contact, the experts agreed the papers must be a forgery
[71:54.34]as it would be impossible for a woman to have authored the papers, given their rigorously mathematical contents.
[72:11.88]Damn, tell us how you really feel.
[72:20.64]I can't believe the streamer said that.
[72:27.90]What the fuck?
[72:34.88]1780, right?
[72:36.03]1785.
[72:43.13]As I said, that's a fairly dated document.
[72:49.28]17...
[72:53.54]Watch out!
[72:57.27]Am I hitting him?
[73:05.68]Jerma, why did you say W misogyny?
[73:14.23]I did.
[73:18.60]Oh man, that's so stupid
[73:27.09]I did that with one health.
[73:28.96]Are you kidding me?
[73:29.75]That should be some kind of a world record.
[73:33.81]I didn't even look at my health during that.
[73:35.15]That was all vibe-based gameplay.
[73:40.19]That's crazy.
[73:46.50]Right, we gotta go in there.
[73:47.54]I gotta go upgrade my shit.
[73:50.05]Wait!
[73:53.12]Okay.
[73:54.42]I need to get cursed.
[74:00.03]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[74:01.51]I forgot about this guy's stupid schtick!
[74:08.90]I think I'm alright.
[74:13.87]Curse me.
[74:17.28]I got the eclipse ring back.
[74:22.32]I had all this shit too.
[74:31.03]There we go.
[74:32.82]I need this.
[74:33.24]I gotta get cursed like crazy.
[74:45.91]Because we have to run around and find curse chests.
[74:50.79]They're very important.
[74:56.04]There we go.
[74:56.55]Alright, I am maximum cursed.
[75:05.88]We're just doing an item run.
[75:14.26]That's fine.
[75:14.89]That's fine.
[75:15.89]A cult chamber.
[75:16.63]Yeah, we're already down here.
[75:20.25]There's gonna be jump scares and stuff.
[75:22.04]Wait, what?
[75:22.72]Oh, shit.
[75:30.16]Oh, that's not good.
[75:30.72]Here we go.
[75:31.23]There's one.
[75:32.42]What'd I get?
[75:32.90]I got a poised charm.
[75:38.24]I don't want the poise charm, I want the projectile ring.
[75:48.23]No, I wanted to be cursed enough.
[75:55.47]I actually need to run.
[76:03.01]Alright, I'm cursed enough.
[76:04.32]Get me the fuck out of here.
[76:08.14]Get me the fuck out.
[76:17.80]I'm just doing an item run.
[76:19.32]This is how you get your items back.
[76:20.49]Do not cursor on me right now.
[76:29.39]Fuck you.
[76:32.03]Fuck you, I rolled perfectly into that.
[76:43.92]Come on, get me.
[76:46.61]Exquisite spell ring.
[76:48.18]I don't want spell shit.
[76:51.38]Go in!
[76:52.47]Go in!
[76:53.90]Go in.
[76:59.90]Okay.
[77:01.00]Give me a second.
[77:02.45]Eat some bread.
[77:08.17]I need that ring.
[77:12.40]I refuse to do any more gameplay until I get that ring back.
[77:22.77]When was the last time you baked bread?
[77:23.93]I don't think ever in my entire life.
[77:36.32]Give me a curse chest, please.
[77:37.76]Oh fuck, I got two of those now.
[77:46.22]Don't I?
[77:57.31]I think I have two of those.
[78:02.39]Okay, the shotgun's gonna be insane.
[78:16.16]Just doing an item run.
[78:17.41]Yep, it's fine.
[78:18.30]I'm not going to fight you.
[78:28.29]That's fine.
[78:28.95]Just make sure I don't run by one of those gooey looking chests.
[78:41.67]Oh fuck, that's kind of- No!
[78:49.80]Nooooooo!
[78:53.20]No!
[78:53.69]That's not what I want!
[79:03.41]I can dispel that.
[79:12.42]Okay.
[79:13.53]Make that sound again.
[79:14.42]I don't think I could.
[79:15.31]I don't even know how I did it.
[79:21.48]Okay, down from here.
[79:22.65]Alright, dispel this.
[79:29.80]This is back here.
[79:30.77]I do need to do shit here.
[79:34.24]Yep, come on.
[79:36.84]Fuck you!
[79:37.50]I don't want the melee stuff!
[79:39.13]That's not what I wanted when I wanted things back.
[79:42.48]There's another one.
[79:46.95]A curse charm.
[79:50.80]Great.
[79:54.36]This place is loaded with these, but...
[79:58.34]Come on.
[80:03.17]Uh-huh.
[80:04.22]Alright, now I have to go.
[80:05.82]I can't lose.
[80:10.49]I have to win?
[80:11.31]No losing.
[80:16.71]Get back on the right track.
[80:30.67]We're fine.
[80:35.31]Workshop.
[80:35.97]Perfect.
[80:37.26]I think he can upgrade.
[80:38.16]Maybe it's him.
[80:39.35]Yep.
[80:42.28]I never found out who made them.
[80:43.81]The metal in the tools is infused with organ grease.
[80:46.56]Any upgraded weapon will stick around night after night.
[80:49.54]And I can strengthen one of your weapons free of charge.
[80:53.01]Cool.
[80:53.85]Okay.
[80:56.60]This is gonna go from 40 to 43.
[81:00.50]Yep.
[81:03.22]Holy shit.
[81:14.04]This thing is insane now.
[81:15.39]46 plus 29.
[81:22.42]Okay, give me the ammo now.
[81:23.69]Alright, shotgun shells.
[81:24.87]This thing is disgusting.
[81:29.72]Max bullets?
[81:31.47]Just buy max incendiary jars.
[81:38.78]Okay, we're cooking now.
[81:49.88]Do you have any benefits for drinking green tea?
[81:55.19]Oh, somebody answered it.
[82:00.17]Yeah, I mean, that sounds kind of accurate to me.
[82:08.28]I love green tea.
[82:09.12]Green tea is great.
[82:15.50]Who sells the acid?
[82:24.12]I should move this in case I want to come up the other way.
[82:35.04]I feel more confident now.
[82:38.37]I have an okay amount of healing items.
[82:39.82]I'd like more.
[82:42.20]But, you know.
[82:45.70]I could go back to nowhere too.
[82:48.81]I am gonna...
[82:52.10]I think I'm going to hire that guy to come walk around so I don't have to shoot very many bullets.
[82:58.54]I hate those mirrors.
[83:11.84]Like, I'll just let that guy fight.
[83:16.26]Because I kind of want more gunpowder if I can get it.
[83:27.57]Alright, you come with me.
[83:28.39]We're gonna just walk around here for a little bit.
[83:33.29]He takes half the money, but who cares?
[83:44.75]This is very important.
[83:54.64]Max health, projectile damage, luck.
[84:02.04]I definitely want to keep that one.
[84:04.36]Who cares about that?
[84:05.52]I don't care about five speed.
[84:10.12]Alright, where is it?
[84:12.29]There.
[84:13.49]Now we're happy.
[84:19.24]Good.
[84:26.01]Okay.
[84:30.40]I wish that was any attack from behind.
[84:40.96]I mean, this is kind of good.
[84:42.00]Maybe I'll just put the Luck one on.
[84:48.02]More items.
[85:00.96]Candle Ring is good, it's perception and luck, yeah.
[85:03.44]It's very good.
[85:04.57]Alright, let's go.
[85:05.05]I'm gonna let this guy fight everything, and if he dies, then he dies.
[85:10.34]How come that doesn't happen to him?
[85:23.33]We're going downstairs.
[85:31.58]Also, I should be able to buy...
[85:34.98]What happened?
[85:39.46]Is he- ugh!
[85:42.89]There you go.
[85:43.25]More gunpowder.
[85:43.88]Good.
[85:45.28]Alright, let's go.
[85:46.09]Get in there and fight.
[85:48.92]Get in there.
[85:54.06]Does somebody do the left?
[85:54.89]Go fight them.
[85:56.17]While I get all the loot.
[85:58.46]They're coming.
[85:58.95]Fight them.
[85:59.57]Here they come.
[86:02.04]Here they come.
[86:06.72]Here he comes!
[86:08.07]Turn around!
[86:09.18]Turn around, quick!
[86:10.53]Turn!
[86:17.28]You got this.
[86:21.50]You fucking got me stabbed!
[86:36.50]Nice.
[86:41.11]Nice work.
[86:48.40]Beasts all over the shop.
[86:50.41]You'll be one soon.
[86:54.56]That... You know the sound I'm talking about.
[86:56.01]It goes...
[87:10.61]It's the loud bird sound.
[87:15.86]You have to suck in air and I don't feel like doing it.
[87:25.46]Nail trap.
[87:28.93]It could be worse.
[87:36.66]I think I'm alright for now.
[87:37.69]I do want more heals.
[87:41.99]That would be great.
[87:45.72]Wait, did I get that?
[87:48.12]I didn't.
[87:55.49]Okay.
[87:57.24]I am gonna go back to where I was planning to go.
[88:04.76]We're gonna go to nowhere.
[88:05.80]I'm gonna get my shit ready.
[88:08.90]I actually have plenty- I got- I got heals.
[88:11.48]I got plenty of heals.
[88:15.12]but I do want a little bit more.
[88:21.19]So,
[88:30.17]Looks good.
[88:32.50]I guess I could upgrade something, but I don't think I want to.
[88:35.87]I want these.
[88:37.88]And a healing spell book.
[88:41.61]And dummy and healing.
[88:50.81]Okay.
[88:59.79]They always have different shit too.
[89:02.68]Poise.
[89:06.59]What is this one?
[89:09.07]organ chamber upgrade.
[89:15.53]Oh!
[89:18.64]I need this.
[89:19.20]100 coins?
[89:20.32]I gotta get 100 coins.
[89:21.75]Sell.
[89:24.96]I need money.
[89:25.84]We're getting rid of a lot of dumb shit that I don't use.
[89:30.97]I could just sell all these, but what a dumb idea that would be, but I don't care.
[89:33.87]I'm going to do it.
[89:37.37]Thank you.
[89:46.80]I'll fire the bodyguard.
[89:48.09]Right, because he takes half the money.
[89:50.56]Alright, remind me when I come back here that I can do this.
[89:57.60]Because that's five more levels that I can get.
[90:04.68]What does it take?
[90:08.13]Okay, I can make a shitload of this grease.
[90:11.51]I have 15 organ grease.
[90:16.17]That's ridiculous.
[90:25.34]How are the games?
[90:26.11]Games are going good.
[90:28.01]It's just a gaming Sunday.
[90:30.74]You know.
[90:34.41]Alright.
[90:40.43]We were going this way.
[90:41.50]Do I dare?
[90:42.42]I can't.
[90:42.91]Can I go down here with him?
[90:45.26]I cannot.
[90:48.29]Okay, this is my redemption arc down here.
[90:53.88]Because I can use this still.
[90:55.04]Alright, so redemption arc coming up.
[90:59.52]A golden spear?
[91:08.44]Let's redo my inventory.
[91:13.59]I'll take the golden spear.
[91:17.02]Let's go like this one here.
[91:21.71]Shotgun and handgun are in a great spot.
[91:25.41]That's fine.
[91:26.05]I do want to replace this with a grenade.
[91:32.76]Okay.
[91:37.99]That's still fine.
[91:42.90]And this is not fine.
[91:48.77]Actually, put that up.
[91:50.44]Put this up here.
[91:52.54]Put this here.
[91:54.35]Put the food down here.
[91:55.55]Yep.
[92:00.84]Alright, let's go.
[92:01.82]I am ready.
[92:09.69]Spirit does have a lot of distance.
[92:14.14]I'm not gonna shoot unless I absolutely have to.
[92:16.15]I thought he was gonna shit his pants like the other guy does.
[92:23.19]Alright, here we go.
[92:25.22]redemption.
[92:38.59]Somebody's got hurt.
[92:40.39]Wait.
[93:02.59]That guy hurts a lot.
[93:05.18]I don't know if I'm...
[93:05.81]I don't know if I...
[93:06.29]I don't know...
[93:06.67]I don't know...
[93:08.63]I just got hit by everything.
[93:11.21]Okay, we're gonna leave.
[93:12.64]I'm gonna leave.
[93:23.75]How do I clear the necrosis?
[93:40.93]Oh my god, there's skeletons!
[93:47.00]What the fuck am I shooting at here?
[93:48.73]Run.
[93:50.71]Run!
[93:51.05]Run!
[93:52.02]Run!
[93:53.12]Everybody relax.
[94:06.93]Run!
[94:15.06]He's almost dead.
[94:15.89]Oh my fucking god, the whole crew is up here.
[94:30.74]Where'd he get all his health back?
[94:35.78]Holy shit, it was a different guy.
[94:54.70]I think we're good.
[94:57.41]I think we're good.
[94:58.74]I think we're good.
[95:04.51]Uh, oh, I got blood.
[95:05.86]We're good.
[95:14.36]More offerings.
[95:16.80]Alright.
[95:17.76]I can level up now.
[95:18.83]And we can explore.
[95:23.68]Fuck!
[95:24.31]Oh, it's those things.
[95:36.49]What's even through here?
[95:38.54]The bridge.
[95:40.30]No thanks.
[95:43.28]Labyrinth chamber?
[95:48.69]I need items.
[95:53.14]Only four coins in there?
[95:54.43]Are you kidding me?
[95:57.26]That's a joke.
[96:03.82]That's it?
[96:05.91]Joke.
[96:07.46]Maybe I need to be cursed.
[96:09.41]I'll try it.
[96:23.04]Thank you.
[96:34.21]Okay.
[96:35.83]I'm very cursed.
[96:37.56]Here we go.
[96:43.82]No, I got everything.
[96:50.98]Shy stuff.
[96:57.74]Stop it.
[97:16.05]First aid.
[97:16.68]And a...
[97:32.37]Nope.
[97:39.98]Okay.
[97:47.82]That's fine.
[97:56.36]There's somebody in here.
[97:59.04]Depending on what this is, shotgun's coming up.
[98:01.91]Yeah.
[98:03.16]Look at this weirdo.
[98:11.25]No, incendiary jar.
[98:21.79]Will they get paid by this?
[98:42.19]Yeah!
[98:44.83]Burnt.
[98:52.25]Cures poison status effect once a minute.
[98:56.95]Get away from me.
[99:05.79]Who's crunching?
[99:07.47]Somebody.
[99:16.05]Knight's ring?
[99:16.75]Oh, it's a melee ring.
[99:23.04]Oh my goodness!
[99:29.02]Let's go down.
[99:43.45]Ow, I just burnt myself.
[99:47.15]The incendiary jars are amazing.
[99:52.11]Especially when you're doing a projectile build.
[100:06.40]Um, I do want to do this.
[100:09.46]I still have necrosis.
[100:16.59]You ever just drop it like it's hot?
[100:18.36]Um...
[100:22.34]Sometimes.
[100:24.31]Mood's gotta be right.
[100:31.26]Okay, this is the chamber to the lower...
[100:33.14]I'm in the lower labyrinth.
[100:34.57]Okay, the lock is broken on this door?
[100:37.07]Interesting.
[100:39.80]There's a weirdo in here.
[100:48.25]This is a fight room, but a chest.
[100:50.09]Let's do it.
[100:59.84]Oh my god.
[101:03.08]What are you talking about?
[101:04.27]Hey, how did he see me?
[101:19.93]Didn't do any damage.
[101:21.20]What?
[101:22.00]I'm confused.
[101:31.70]Oh, my fucking health is gone.
[101:40.02]What killed that guy?
[101:41.70]Oh!
[101:52.85]I'm not fucking around.
[101:53.82]I have to use the shotgun.
[102:10.96]Get the fuck out of here!
[102:16.47]Burning zombie.
[102:25.86]So what's in the chest?
[102:34.72]Oh, this has got a lot of words.
[102:36.90]Alright.
[102:38.21]Converts 26% of physical damage to bleeding buildup from melee attacks.
[102:44.84]okay that but there's more plus four speed plus 23 max health
[102:54.76]And three bleeding buildup.
[102:56.73]But...
[102:58.49]I don't care about spell.
[102:59.16]I mean, this just seems kind of like an insane plus...
[103:01.38]The ring I have on right now is plus 10 max health.
[103:05.26]Is that a crazy one?
[103:06.12]Hold on.
[103:09.04]Yeah, plus 10 max health is this one.
[103:15.74]This is a unique ring.
[103:18.37]That seems like kind of crazy.
[103:19.68]A ton of speed, a ton of max health.
[103:24.04]My bleed tolerance would be awful though.
[103:25.85]Yeah.
[103:28.03]I'll keep it for now.
[103:32.97]I'm running out of ways to kill things.
[103:38.32]But I'm gonna be able to level up like five times.
[103:43.80]What's in here?
[103:47.94]No, nope.
[103:49.63]Nope.
[103:50.82]Nope.
[103:57.35]Silver hairpin.
[104:13.50]Okay.
[104:15.93]No enemies in here.
[104:18.20]Oh, alright.
[104:20.71]Easy.
[104:29.01]I'm gonna check the right side as well.
[104:41.40]What is over here?
[104:43.94]Alright, there's somebody here.
[104:44.73]I have plenty of ways to kill things.
[104:48.50]I just need to go in my... That guy's kind of scary.
[104:53.19]Is he looking at me?
[104:54.07]No.
[104:58.43]Alright, good.
[105:01.15]Very good.
[105:01.66]I need...
[105:05.63]What else do I have?
[105:08.48]I have a grenade, two paralysis jars,
[105:13.91]and three shotgun bullets.
[105:15.84]So this is gonna have to work out, maybe.
[105:20.71]Expedition Notes.
[105:23.13]Much as we modern initiates make regular use of blood and organ grease, our ancient counterparts also realized the value of blood.
[105:30.69]Small bronze vials of pungent blood are plentiful and are guarded jealously by their undead owners.
[105:39.51]In one chamber, the withered husk of an old king or champion sits upon a throne.
[105:45.61]Reawakening him by pouring some blood down his throat was a mistake.
[105:50.09]It's clear.
[105:51.39]that the long legacy of cruel gamesmanship in the labyrinth has rendered its undead inhabitants incapable of anything besides violence.
[105:59.42]A shame.
[106:00.52]Think of the unparalleled anthropological value if we were able to truly engage with these Malenia-old men.
[106:13.13]Oh nice, this is the not a horror game that makes you scared, right?
[106:16.33]Not everything's a horror game.
[106:18.49]This is a not horror, thrilling, creepy, fun,
[106:29.85]clock-towered soulslike Resident Evil, upgradable,
[106:35.05]roguelike, mystery, dungeon crawling experience that you should have.
[106:47.72]I mean it's kind of a horror game.
[106:54.84]Do you think Die Hard is a Christmas movie?
[107:02.32]I don't know.
[107:06.76]What the f- That person's shooting me!
[107:17.69]Don't move.
[107:26.96]Fuck that.
[107:29.47]These guys take so much damage.
[107:31.72]Oh!
[107:36.54]What did I just do?
[107:37.31]Excuse me?
[107:39.80]I went down that hallway.
[107:44.56]It's a fucking gun.
[107:48.01]God, dude.
[107:56.20]Oh my god!
[107:57.72]Stop heading up!
[107:59.35]I gotta use the D-pad when I'm fighting with enemies like this.
[108:05.49]CBC Cargo Show.
[108:08.44]Oh!
[108:21.02]I hate these guys, they're so fucking strong.
[108:25.43]That guy's shooting knives out of his body!
[108:37.34]Fuck you, dude.
[108:43.23]Get shit on.
[108:44.89]Get shit on.
[108:51.33]No, I'm trying.
[108:53.34]My melee is not what I need.
[109:09.12]Did I get double hit by that?
[109:29.23]No, I'm dead.
[109:50.58]How is he pre-firing?
[109:52.85]Get under there.
[110:03.03]Please die!
[110:03.92]No, don't do it!
[110:10.21]Yeah.
[110:11.53]These guys suck.
[110:13.38]I have to get out of here now.
[110:14.43]I need to level up like five times.
[110:18.44]Duck when he runs?
[110:19.30]No, you gotta hide when he runs.
[110:23.47]What a piece of shit that was.
[110:25.19]Now I have nothing.
[110:25.92]I have no...
[110:27.89]Abilities, I have healing barrier.
[110:34.15]Okay, this thing is awful.
[110:36.90]What about the whip?
[110:39.26]Fine, let's try it.
[110:47.82]I'm not fucking with anything else right now.
[110:51.06]No, thank you.
[111:05.00]I wanna... Oh my god.
[111:09.88]I walked around too far.
[111:11.42]I have to leave now.
[111:13.43]Oh my goodness gracious.
[111:14.70]Oh my god.
[111:15.10]Oh my god.
[111:15.50]This is blocked.
[111:23.76]I don't wanna go in the old king's room.
[111:30.92]I'm lost!
[111:34.63]Dude!
[111:37.72]I actually am lost.
[111:39.04]I think it's down here and then I have to go up here.
[111:41.55]Then, yep.
[111:43.86]I remember this.
[111:47.74]Why would I engage?
[111:49.53]Why am I engaging?
[111:55.69]Why am I engaging?
[112:00.94]Why am I engaging?
[112:07.60]Why am I engaging?
[112:27.57]So,
[112:40.11].
[112:43.14].
[112:57.55]Wait, it hurt him.
[113:02.92]I can't block that.
[113:03.79]I thought I could.
[113:07.34]Nope.
[113:16.64]No!
[113:17.10]Stop, relax, I got this.
[113:27.09]Just hide under here.
[113:27.93]Go.
[113:29.00]Okay.
[113:29.12]We're good.
[113:30.85]Just ditch that guy.
[113:31.73]Fuck it.
[113:45.13]Thank you.
[113:54.58]Alright, it's bleeding.
[114:02.91]Hurry up and die!
[114:05.17]Where am I?
[114:15.65]Oh that's bad.
[114:27.04]He's going to come downstairs.
[114:27.84]No, he's running.
[114:37.51]Dude, he runs too much.
[114:40.14]Alright, everything in here is dead.
[114:41.38]I just have to collect the loot and fucking run.
[114:47.66]Open it.
[114:51.43]Oh, that thing is crazy.
[114:55.70]See ya.
[114:58.09]Goodbye.
[115:09.06]I gotta go up.
[115:10.29]Oh fuck, I've ruined everything.
[115:13.06]Oh my god, this is bad.
[115:14.65]Disaster.
[115:15.99]Incoming disaster.
[115:16.72]I gotta go down or up?
[115:17.64]I forget.
[115:19.37]Definitely not.
[115:20.75]Definitely not down.
[115:27.98]Oh, yes.
[115:31.45]Yes.
[115:32.87]You had nine spirit twigs.
[115:34.78]We don't talk about that unless I bring it up.
[115:40.25]Alright, this is huge.
[115:47.94]Why was I engaging?
[115:53.79]Because I really wanted the item.
[115:56.08]I could have come back, sure.
[116:02.94]Hmm.
[116:03.97]Let's get this to five.
[116:09.37]Do it again.
[116:09.84]Okay.
[116:16.46]Maybe more health, I think.
[116:24.31]Okay, now I should have enough money.
[116:27.60]to go back to nowhere.
[116:36.56]Very nice.
[116:38.39]I'm actually running out of candles.
[116:52.83]You can build your stats Souls-like,
[116:56.18]Um, a little bit, kind of.
[116:58.99]I'm gonna take a quick break, too.
[116:59.85]I'm gonna pee.
[117:00.58]I'm gonna grab another drink.
[117:01.98]But I'm gonna level up first.
[117:05.09]And we'll continue.
[117:17.48]Because I should be able to upgrade this thing now.
[117:23.68]Who sells it?
[117:29.82]you do.
[117:30.50]136.
[117:35.02]There we go.
[117:37.40]Okay.
[117:42.61]I have a lot of grease.
[117:48.40]Upgrade this.
[117:50.02]Excellent.
[117:55.69]So I need a lot of money.
[117:56.87]But I already have a decent amount, so let's go.
[118:05.59]Uh... Poise is important, but whatever.
[118:16.83]Curse build up.
[118:18.54]Maybe more health.
[118:19.39]Or should I just go all in on...
[118:21.64]I said I was going to go all in on speed and dex.
[118:25.42]Weirdness?
[118:26.91]Well, weirdness is spell damage and less curse for using spells.
[118:36.30]Let's go agility.
[118:42.76]Agility Dex again.
[118:49.25]Okay, I need more grease.
[118:55.76]Oh, that's available now.
[118:56.50]Alright, cool.
[119:02.70]Have you addressed how Sterk crashed out the other day?
[119:04.99]Sterk, what are you talking about?
[119:10.19]¶¶
[119:21.24]Oh, he's talking about when he played Blueprints.
[119:22.89]He did fine.
[119:26.84]He liked it.
[119:35.43]I need... more organs.
[119:49.14]I got a ton of metal.
[119:51.18]How much gunpowder do I have?
[119:56.55]Not really any.
[120:02.08]I want to get a closer look at that ring.
[120:03.67]That thing was crazy, right?
[120:12.04]That's fine, but 64 perception.
[120:17.57]The melee damage and spell damage.
[120:18.75]If I can actually do only projectiles, this is insane.
[120:23.49]I'm gonna put it on.
[120:32.89]That's a lot more max health too.
[120:48.05]Alright, what do we got for quests?
[120:52.52]Okay.
[120:54.43]I didn't do any of this yet.
[120:55.45]I gotta go back to the valley.
[120:59.86]I would like some ammo, but...
[121:03.51]I need money for that, so we're just gonna have to deal with it.
[121:07.40]Because I have...
[121:10.74]I have some jars.
[121:12.93]I got jars, I'm alright.
[121:15.38]Alright, I'll be right back.
[121:15.98]I'm gonna pee.
[121:17.91]See you guys in a few minutes.
[121:22.93]you
[121:31.84]Thank you.
[122:39.62]Thank you.
[123:05.02]Amen.
[123:43.02]Thank you.
[123:53.55]Thank you.
[124:14.61]Thank you.
[124:52.84].
[125:00.83].
[125:01.14]So,
[125:24.49]you
[126:09.14]How are we doing?
[126:20.38]Sup.
[126:23.61]I'm back.
[126:33.98]okay four ass jars I'm ready
[126:45.19]So this is where I was going.
[126:54.12]There's a bunch of scary shit out here, isn't there?
[126:55.78]I need my lantern.
[127:02.59]Hold on.
[127:08.36]I'm not gonna fight anything, I'm just gonna go.
[127:14.14]East Valley, here we go.
[127:23.68]I think I have to go down from here.
[127:26.09]Valley Cottages.
[127:31.32]Oh, shit.
[127:31.58]Hold on.
[127:35.19]I gotta do more hiding, I think.
[127:46.28]Yep, I remember this.
[127:49.65]Okay.
[127:51.03]I don't want to gamble.
[127:53.20]I got to go this way.
[127:54.32]Stop peeking.
[127:54.80]We're going this way.
[127:57.36]That's right, because the day reset.
[127:59.15]So I'm going down here.
[128:05.97]Crossroads.
[128:08.91]Alright, what did he say?
[128:09.71]To the east?
[128:13.54]Okay, the cathedral...
[128:16.06]Alright, so now I do have to go down deeper in the valley.
[128:19.30]Alright, I need to go deeper in the valley.
[128:23.57]So it was this way and then maybe past here?
[128:26.56]Right, because this is where I started.
[128:40.58]East Forest Dock.
[128:50.00]Good evening, miss.
[128:51.40]You can call me Boatman.
[128:54.02]As a member of the Merry Band, I'm often engaged in activities of the treasonous sort.
[129:01.02]Being so, I can't rightly be giving my actual name to every lost girl who comes upon my dock, yeah?
[129:07.87]We have no missions underway right this moment, so I'm free to take on an extra job or two.
[129:13.10]Would you be needing a boat ride somewhere?
[129:15.80]Yes, the boat is a bit small, but so is the Dewern Brook.
[129:19.42]Any bigger, and we wouldn't make it around the first bend.
[129:23.95]I sell a boat pass.
[129:25.27]Just a one-time fee and I'll take you where you need to go any night.
[129:29.53]Also have supplies.
[129:30.72]Okay.
[129:31.14]How much is a boat pass?
[129:35.24]50 coins.
[129:39.21]I don't have it.
[129:41.30]Okay.
[129:44.45]Just gonna dive off.
[129:52.01]Alright, I need to make some money.
[129:54.28]Let's go get some kills.
[129:57.59]And I'll be ready to go.
[129:59.10]There's like five people out here.
[130:00.10]I'll probably get it right out here.
[130:03.35]I kind of wish I kept the money thing now.
[130:06.96]The ring that gives you 30% more money.
[130:17.54]Alright, let's make some money here.
[130:21.21]Ow!
[130:29.83]Get acid, get acid, get acid, I think.
[130:40.11]Don't... Fifteen coins.
[130:46.29]There we go.
[130:49.00]Alright, this is actually not good.
[130:55.51]Oh my fucking god!
[130:58.34]How did I do that to myself?
[131:00.93]I don't need to do that yet.
[131:11.61]Let him kill him.
[131:12.56]Let him kill the guy.
[131:17.62]He's still alive!
[131:19.01]Shoot your friend.
[131:20.77]Oh my fuck.
[131:23.93]I think I have a little bit of... Do I have anything else to heal?
[131:26.87]Yep, I do.
[131:40.74]to start bleeding already.
[131:46.66]I have that anti-damage melee ring on.
[131:49.69]Blah!
[132:01.11]Oh my god, fuck that guy.
[132:15.97]I'll stand in this all day.
[132:20.76]Hey, you're acting weird today.
[132:21.97]Are you sure it's not you?
[132:32.83]Okay, that's better.
[132:47.50]I need money.
[132:49.40]There we go.
[132:49.95]I actually might have enough.
[132:51.81]But I need to kill this guy.
[132:54.49]I'm so close to killing him.
[133:04.66]Can I block the gunshot?
[133:07.10]I might be able to.
[133:15.93]Where'd that guy go?
[133:16.57]I think that guy died.
[133:19.59]I think the poison killed that guy.
[133:25.63]Cool.
[133:26.17]I'll take it.
[133:26.58]That's fine.
[133:31.15]Okay, you can block it.
[133:51.30]Is he bleeding?
[133:51.84]Oh fuck, he broke the shield.
[133:57.27]Hold on.
[134:08.70]Why am I fighting Abraham Lincoln?
[134:21.20]Gear can break?
[134:22.51]Uh, it can.
[134:25.18]That was a wooden shield, though.
[134:26.58]I'm imagining they're probably not that durable.
[134:29.92]How much money do I have?
[134:51.61]I got the present.
[134:56.80]Oh my god.
[134:57.54]That was worth coming down here for.
[135:05.75]You get to come back to life.
[135:14.56]Do I have to have it equipped or is it just on?
[135:23.46]That's kind of good.
[135:30.93]It's just there.
[135:31.86]Alright.
[135:32.10]Well, that was worth 25 coins.
[135:47.40]Ben Franklin... daughter or Abraham Lincoln's son?
[135:51.18]Ah, that's a Ben Franklin daughter.
[136:06.38]I'm just trying to get money, that's all.
[136:07.55]I'm just trying to get money.
[136:11.41]I'm not gonna be able to fight any of these guys.
[136:18.25]Alright.
[136:29.84]You know what?
[136:30.44]I actually can fight this guy.
[136:31.85]I got a shield back, alright?
[136:34.74]Alright, gimme...
[136:37.49]I actually can shoot you with this.
[136:46.36]Okay, good.
[137:05.77]That guy had a lot of money on him, holy shit.
[137:12.28]Carry on my wayward son or kiss from a rose.
[137:16.62]You just thought you're just being a weirdo.
[137:18.93]Carry on my wayward son's son, or kiss from a rose daughter.
[137:23.13]Uh, kiss from a rose daughter.
[137:29.65]You made that joke a week ago.
[137:31.14]You wrote that same thing last week.
[137:47.95]I can pay the boatman.
[138:03.38]I've crossed over three state lines while watching this stream.
[138:13.22]That's either a very long road trip or...
[138:15.59]I wonder where you're going.
[138:25.67]Alright, now that you've got the boat pass, I can take you on a ride.
[138:28.07]Just let me know when you're ready.
[138:30.56]Let's go.
[138:31.29]Travel west.
[138:35.31]I bet you thought I'd be rowing.
[138:37.56]Josette, the basement witch, traded us this creature some time back.
[138:41.62]She says a whole group of them were found in the deepest level of the Byzantine labyrinth.
[138:46.36]They followed her around like a flock of ducklings.
[138:49.49]It was a noble thing you did, saving Josette.
[138:56.13]Look at that, we're nearly arrived.
[139:01.68]Bug duck.
[139:11.62]What the hell was that?
[139:13.51]Did you see that?
[139:15.89]What was that?
[139:26.59]Am I...
[139:26.99]I'm not even cursed.
[139:30.47]Cagewood Circus Entrance.
[139:40.54]Oh, good evening, lass.
[139:42.47]Do you want to see the freaks in cages?
[139:45.93]You want to partake in games of skill and chance?
[139:48.86]Do you want to see the amazing Edgar?
[139:52.30]Or do you want to wander around a spooky forest filled with cages for... Trist all the night?
[139:59.29]Choice is yours.
[140:01.42]For the low price of 100 coins, an unlimited entry to Cagewood Circus is yours.
[140:06.62]I don't have any money.
[140:07.91]Come back and...
[140:09.33]Change your mind.
[140:14.51]Alright, I need 100 coins.
[140:16.94]I remember this being cool.
[140:18.90]There are carnival games in there.
[140:21.06]And you know we're gonna play them all.
[140:28.05]Alright, cage wood.
[140:39.02]I might be in trouble here.
[140:40.38]Hold on.
[140:45.78]I don't have any projectiles.
[140:46.90]I have a grenade!
[141:04.33]What are you doing?
[141:06.82]What the fuck is that?
[141:11.67]Oh my god!
[141:13.80]Alright, while you're bleeding, just wait till you bleed.
[141:20.56]Aborted Experiment.
[141:27.60]You do way too much damage.
[141:28.62]I'm going to die if I don't get the fuck out of here right now.
[141:45.30]Come on, how do you dodge that?
[141:56.10]I need something.
[141:58.10]No more projectiles?
[141:59.11]Nothing?
[142:03.76]no I could just try to kill her and then leave and get out of here and level up
[142:18.38]Do I have any other shields at all?
[142:20.65]I do.
[142:23.01]This is like a magic damage thing, though.
[142:24.66]No, that's not going to work.
[142:27.07]I think I'm screwed.
[142:27.99]I think I'm just run.
[142:32.13]Yeah, this is a GG.
[142:32.90]This is run.
[142:38.26]That's a blacket house, though.
[142:41.28]Alright, I gotta go farm for five whole minutes.
[143:06.10]Actually, I might be alright, hold on.
[143:13.95]I can craft here.
[143:15.41]Hold on a second.
[143:19.21]Okay, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[143:20.59]Very good.
[143:21.25]Alright.
[143:22.32]I actually might be alright now.
[143:26.65]Because now I can throw the jars.
[143:28.50]And I have a lot of them.
[143:29.25]Alright, I'm not going to leave yet.
[143:32.58]I have an opportunity here.
[143:46.35]What carnival games are in there?
[143:47.99]All kinds of cool stuff.
[143:51.08]I think there's three or four different mini-games.
[143:54.29]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[143:55.01]Hold on.
[144:02.02]Where are you?
[144:06.47]I hope you're susceptible to acid.
[144:11.49]A machine for powering the residence with electricity.
[144:14.38]It's missing an electrical generator.
[144:19.44]Don't have one.
[144:32.28]I forget where you get that.
[144:37.42]Wait, she died.
[144:38.99]No, she didn't.
[144:40.97]Nice.
[144:41.28]Good.
[144:43.08]Not good.
[144:54.86]The more money, the better.
[145:04.98]Oh my fucking god, what the hell was that?
[145:07.26]There's a giant horse!
[145:12.27]What the fuck, dude?
[145:14.74]Okay.
[145:16.87]I'm not fighting the horse right now.
[145:28.44]I can kill it.
[145:38.90]Oh, alright.
[145:42.92]Lost horse.
[145:50.04]Have you ever played, uh, is it Ico?
[145:54.16]I never played Ico.
[145:57.30]Actually, no, that's not true.
[145:59.66]I did a very long time ago.
[146:04.75]Cagewood Memorial.
[146:12.01]Shadow of the Colossus is great.
[146:14.66]And so is The Last Guardian.
[146:17.35]The Last Guardian is great if you can get over the fact that the whole game is like 9 frames a second.
[146:23.62]It's a great story.
[146:25.38]Gameplay's a little weird, but I think it was a good game.
[146:33.44]Okay, let this caged wood stand as a monument to the collective rage of the formerly initiated at their ghastly treatment.
[146:41.63]In this forest, 100 guilty men have been bound to cages.
[146:46.25]May all who pass through remember what was done and the mad souls that remain to this day in Blackett House.
[146:55.70]It's fucked up.
[146:56.84]What's going on here?
[146:59.61]You said this last year at the Game Awards.
[147:04.36]And does the point not stand?
[147:24.94]Oh boy.
[147:26.27]Nope.
[147:30.93]That was weird.
[147:38.83]Nope.
[147:39.25]We're going back there later.
[147:40.68]I cannot take that right now.
[147:41.75]I need shotgun.
[147:42.41]I need gun.
[147:42.91]I need... way more.
[147:52.75]And I want to go to the circus.
[148:02.85]I need a room to know where.
[148:03.95]Is there not a...
[148:13.70]There's probably a mirror in there somewhere.
[148:15.31]I just didn't get it.
[148:15.94]It's fine.
[148:16.74]This is free.
[148:26.67]Oh, no mirrors past the bog in the valley.
[148:29.78]Okay, that makes sense.
[148:36.70]Your best bet is to use the mirror in that abandoned cottage by the east forest dock.
[148:42.04]Yeah.
[148:43.13]Alright, so we don't... we can't... there's no cop out there.
[148:47.72]This is our only checkpoint is right here.
[149:04.71]Are we gonna watch the Game Awards?
[149:06.08]Uh, we might.
[149:07.81]I brought it up to Ster the other day.
[149:09.98]We might do it.
[149:10.87]Maybe.
[149:20.56]I need money bad.
[149:25.84]It's time to sell.
[149:33.55]I'm not using this really at all.
[149:41.89]I'm not using this at all either ever.
[149:47.93]I'm never ever equipping this, ever.
[149:53.25]I have two of these.
[149:58.71]Amen.
[150:03.99]What do you think about the mystery statue?
[150:05.66]Is this a mystery statue?
[150:08.01]What's the mystery statue all about?
[150:10.76]I haven't heard about this.
[150:32.54]The Game Awards has a mystery statue,
[150:36.81]Is it covered in a big tarp?
[150:38.77]What does it look like?
[150:39.55]Let me look this up.
[150:41.18]Hold on a second.
[150:41.95]Game Awards mystery statue.
[150:57.70]Game Awards statue.
[151:03.29]Um...
[151:07.36]I don't know
[151:12.23]Is this a picture of just Geoff Keighley standing in front of this statue?
[151:17.05]But I think he's superimposed.
[151:18.37]I don't think he's actually there.
[151:19.60]Is he actually in front of it?
[151:39.20]Well, whatever it is, I'm sure we'll find out very soon.
[151:45.93]Okay, now I gotta go back and do and, and, and.
[151:55.74]What if it's a new FromSoftware game?
[152:06.39]I feel like they've already talked about a lot of stuff that they're doing and did.
[152:13.43]We'll see, I don't know.
[152:16.73]God damn it.
[152:34.06]There's an item I didn't get.
[152:34.95]What is it?
[152:37.41]What did I not pick up here?
[152:44.34]Oh, okay, cool.
[153:00.74]Can I really only make that much?
[153:03.79]Well, I got ammo though, that's fine.
[153:06.44]That scared the shit out of me.
[153:11.29]Okay, 18 shots in this, which is good.
[153:13.68]One Omega bullet.
[153:18.49]And then I got three, two...
[153:20.16]I got enough.
[153:20.70]I'm fine.
[153:21.34]Should be good.
[153:24.39]I don't have a whole lot of heals, though.
[153:26.98]Five?
[153:27.52]That's fine.
[153:29.70]Okay, now I need to just get money.
[153:35.08]So I need to do a little bit of a money run.
[153:37.90]Okay, money run incoming.
[153:44.82]I'm gonna go downstairs.
[153:49.23]There's a lot of stuff I didn't get here.
[153:53.98]I'm gonna have to put that poison lantern on.
[153:56.41]Yep.
[154:01.44]Okay.
[154:05.79]This is just a money run.
[154:06.80]I'm not trying to kill anything.
[154:09.66]But I will if I have to.
[154:20.26]Alright, I need to use the gun.
[154:33.40]Alright money.
[154:35.89]10 good.
[154:39.44]5 alright, 15 bucks already.
[154:48.05]I can go down too.
[154:48.99]That's tons of gunpowder.
[154:50.18]Hell yeah.
[154:51.12]Alright.
[154:51.60]This is working out really well so far.
[154:55.72]This is the labyrinth.
[154:58.78]Yep, we've been here.
[154:59.62]Did I get any more blood?
[155:05.56]No, okay.
[155:12.67]The stunt worked because everybody's talking about it right now.
[155:19.07]What if Jeff's just like...
[155:21.80]I made this.
[155:23.71]I sculpted this.
[155:25.45]That's it.
[155:27.04]For my new game.
[155:42.30]Jeffborn.
[155:48.29]That shouldn't have made me laugh, but it did.
[155:54.86]I can't shoot you when you're this close.
[156:05.74]I need 100 bucks.
[156:11.62]These guys drop a lot of shit.
[156:26.21]Okay.
[156:35.21]Big money.
[156:43.41]collect every single object.
[156:54.07]I'm being poisoned right now.
[156:56.25]I gotta stand here.
[156:56.80]Give me a second.
[157:04.04]That's less likely than Bloodborne 2.
[157:06.46]I don't know if we're gonna get a Bloodborne 2, guys.
[157:09.91]If anything, we'll get a Bloodborne remake.
[157:26.64]I think Bloodborne 2 is... And this is coming from somebody that...
[157:31.72]This is one of my favorite games ever made.
[157:34.89]You want there to be a Bloodborne 2, but if Bloodborne 2 came out, you might not be happy about it.
[157:43.72]I feel like that's the kind of game where if they made a sequel, I think just it existing in the first place might actually kind of ruin why the first one was so special.
[157:53.02]I don't think it needs a sequel.
[157:54.62]In fact, I don't think I would want it to be a sequel.
[158:05.11]That game was made after, what, after Dark Souls 2.
[158:13.37]That's pre-Elden Ring.
[158:15.15]That's pre-Dark Souls 3.
[158:16.26]I don't know.
[158:19.19]I don't think I want a post-Elden Ring Bloodborne 2.
[158:26.53]It was made during Dark Souls 2, yeah.
[158:29.15]I feel like it's kind of a different... A whole different ethos...
[158:34.00]They did such a grand thing going forward after that.
[158:36.61]I don't know.
[158:37.12]I don't think I want them to try to make a Bloodborne 2.
[158:38.80]I think it's perfect the way it is.
[158:53.11]post-Dark Souls 3 is kind of washed, and I say that with love in my heart.
[158:58.36]I disagree.
[158:59.48]I think Elden Ring is the culmination of every single thing that they ever wanted to make.
[159:08.83]I would be shocked if we anytime soon got another... You drink out of the Estus Flask game.
[159:16.52]From FromSoftware in a little while.
[159:23.67]Shadow of the Urtree really did feel like the cap on everything that game could be.
[159:35.06]Now, they could make another one of those, sure.
[159:36.59]You know, you have the, you know, four item slots.
[159:38.94]You have the Estus Blast.
[159:39.88]You have the Dodge Roll.
[159:40.77]You have the Bosses.
[159:42.10]But Elden Ring, there's just so much in that game.
[159:44.47]They made like eight games in that game.
[159:46.62]There's like 10 games in Elden Ring and Shadow of the Earth 3.
[159:51.68]It's like, I'm not sure there's gonna be, I mean, look, I could be eating these words.
[159:55.85]But I feel like, at least for a little while,
[160:00.56]Elden Ring feels like the... Alright, here you go, motherfuckers.
[160:05.96]This is everything.
[160:07.32]This is literally everything.
[160:08.71]This is everything I can give you.
[160:20.44]You know, I really don't want...
[160:22.56]This is something that's interesting to talk about too, maybe.
[160:24.79]I don't want games like that to get bigger.
[160:27.38]I don't want them to be more.
[160:38.49]I like a big game sometimes, but...
[160:42.02]I don't know, I just don't want devs to, especially in like the AA to AAA world, which is what's been happening, is...
[160:48.48]Everything needs to be much grander.
[160:50.60]Everything needs to be so much bigger.
[160:52.05]There needs to be so much more shit for you to do.
[161:03.40]Hold on, I gotta get in here.
[161:14.74]We're going to try that again.
[161:23.72]I probably have a hundred bucks now.
[161:31.89]These guys drop a ton of bullets.
[161:37.08]Return to linearity?
[161:42.90]Yeah, I mean...
[161:45.60]I just don't want it to get to a point where... Because eventually it's... How do you continue to make things bigger?
[161:53.01]Like, how do you make something more grand than we kind of are at?
[162:08.22]Is this thing loaded?
[162:14.48]Do not shoot me with that, please.
[162:42.83]Destiny 2 is a textbook example of what you're describing over there.
[162:45.89]The issue shines the brightest over there.
[162:52.55]I didn't really play Destiny.
[162:58.13]But.
[163:01.88]It's kind of like the everything's a service, right?
[163:03.98]Everything's turning into a service.
[163:05.15]Live service this, live service that.
[163:09.56]I feel like it's incredibly difficult as a developer to keep up with live service content.
[163:19.36]Poison check.
[163:20.02]Oh shit.
[163:20.39]You're right.
[163:31.81]That's why a lot of games most games don't do it.
[163:33.73]Yeah.
[163:40.00]Guys who haven't played Destiny are always like, I haven't played Destiny.
[163:44.43]Well, yeah, I haven't played it.
[163:56.13]Can I kill this guy just with bullets?
[163:58.66]Is it a bad idea?
[164:00.09]Yeah.
[164:00.86]Well, I'm full of bad ideas.
[164:21.83]Watch this not even be worth doing.
[164:23.93]Actually, this is not going to be worth it at all.
[164:26.26]This is going to be a huge mistake that I did this.
[164:42.44]Alright, he probably dropped a one.
[164:52.85]He dropped 13 coins.
[164:54.31]I thought he was gonna drop like 300.
[164:59.05]Well, actually, that's pretty good.
[165:04.48]It was worth it.
[165:20.42]Alright, what do I got?
[165:22.83]118 coins.
[165:23.35]I got enough.
[165:27.49]Do I have what it takes to do one more room?
[165:31.91]I don't have what it takes.
[165:33.04]I'm out of here.
[165:55.88]But also too, when I played Elden Ring the first time, and I got to the end, and I got the end of Shadow of the Earth Tree,
[166:03.13]You kind of sit there and go, oh man, what is Miyazaki gonna come up with next?
[166:09.42]Wow.
[166:10.62]That was crazy.
[166:13.04]But I almost like...
[166:15.26]I feel like at some point,
[166:18.07]I don't really want to, you know, you almost put the pressure on him to be like, Miyazaki, dude, oh, dude, you just made like a fucking 700-hour game with like 7,000 different things to do.
[166:27.10]What the fuck is next, bro?
[166:29.61]Ooh, looking forward to it.
[166:31.00]What are you... Oh, man, it's gonna be genius.
[166:36.22]I'd rather people that like to make things just make things.
[166:43.46]Right?
[166:43.78]When they want to and when they're ready to make things.
[166:46.48]I feel like the pressure on trying to make another crazy fucking thing is...
[166:50.33]I don't know.
[166:52.16]That's how you make bad stuff.
[167:08.12]FromSoft had been wanting to make an open-world game since Dark Souls 2, but the tech wasn't there.
[167:12.76]Elden Ring was inevitable, but they might have got it out of their system.
[167:16.35]Well, that's what I mean.
[167:17.04]Elden Ring really did feel like the culmination of everything they probably ever wanted to truly do.
[167:21.89]Now, I'm not saying, like, alright, we did it, guys, close up shop, whenever we're making another video game ever again, there'll never be a patch, there'll never be...
[167:28.42]patch notes, shove it up your ass, and don't ever ask for anything.
[167:36.74]I can't believe I just sold three of those.
[167:38.36]I'm actually mad at myself.
[167:46.07]I think it was bad
[167:57.46]That happened with Mario Kart 8 versus Mario Kart World.
[168:05.76]I don't know the Mario Kart behind-the-scenes lore that you're describing.
[168:16.75]I need to have 100 coins, but I can maybe make some more shotgun shells?
[168:37.59]No!
[168:47.39]Goodbye.
[168:59.12]What's in the throne room that I didn't get?
[169:13.92]Oh.
[169:28.89]Miyazaki FromSoftware Son or Miyazaki Ghibli Daughter?
[169:37.48]I, uh, huh.
[169:46.63]Hold that thought.
[169:47.44]I want to make potions.
[170:01.66]Alright, I have a ton of shotgun shells now.
[170:05.02]Don't go below a hundred.
[170:08.83]Alright, I got to 99, and that was stupid.
[170:12.37]But, I'll get one dollar on the way there, I promise.
[170:29.37]It's a tough one, but I'm going to have to go with Studio Ghibli Daughter.
[170:34.99]Studio Ghibli Daughter, I think, is whimsical and full of wonder and...
[170:40.96]I feel like, uh, FromSoftware's son would- I kind of- I feel like he's gonna be a little- he might be- he might try a little too hard.
[170:49.97]Because I would be playing a game, and he would come in and be like, oh, dude, you suck at this.
[170:56.44]Whereas Studio Ghibli Daughter would actually show me a painting that she made.
[171:00.68]And I'd be like, whoa!
[171:04.03]I would be embarrassed in front of my FromSoftware son.
[171:08.41]Because we would play, I'd show him, you know, hey, this is Elden Ring, you're a FromSoftware son.
[171:14.54]This is Elden Ring.
[171:15.29]This is what I played when I was younger.
[171:16.83]I mean, I was 40, but let's go a little bit further back.
[171:20.38]This is Dark Souls 1.
[171:21.81]I played this when I was like 26.
[171:24.30]I'm still kind of old, but... How about this?
[171:27.74]This was my Dark Souls.
[171:28.68]This is Super Mario Bros. 1.
[171:31.00]Try to dodge that King Koopa.
[171:33.61]And then he would have already left the room because he's already... Yeah.
[171:37.18]I think he would judge me.
[171:37.92]He would judge my gaming skills and gaming tastes.
[171:42.64]That's beta talk?
[171:43.73]No, that's father and son talk.
[171:46.58]Okay.
[171:47.28]I was trying to connect with my son, and then you showed up and started talking your shit here.
[171:53.46]I'm trying to connect with my FromSoftware son and you showed up, alright?
[171:57.60]This is my fantasy, get out of it.
[171:59.39]Hey, see your way out of it.
[172:18.08]There's an entire legacy of YouTube videos of you being bad at games.
[172:21.56]He'll find it eventually.
[172:28.24]What about the times where I was good at games?
[172:30.25]What about the times where I was actually good at a video game?
[172:33.65]There's a playlist there out of the four or five thousand pieces of video that exist of me.
[172:39.42]At least a hundred of those.
[172:41.39]A hundred of them!
[172:43.29]have some type of quality skill.
[172:46.86]And I'm gonna make sure he sees those.
[172:50.03]In fact, we're gonna start him early on that.
[172:53.50]I'm gonna show him... Like me beating Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[172:59.50]Be like, hey...
[173:01.10]This game's hard, but I beat it on stream.
[173:03.74]And he's going to be like, what is a stream?
[173:05.51]I'll be like, oh, let me show you.
[173:09.93]I'm like, son, you need to sit down.
[173:10.93]I got something to tell you.
[173:15.03]Your father, and I'll have a little curled up lip, used to be kind of a big deal.
[173:24.03]I'm going to show them the compilation.
[173:32.62]God damn it, I need to make money.
[173:34.57]Hold on.
[173:42.72]Show him the Jex of Onesie.
[173:45.03]And I'm gonna be passing this down to you.
[173:49.96]The Jex Onesie.
[173:52.78]Yeah, there it is.
[173:55.21]Yeah, we'll clean the shit stains off it.
[173:57.14]Don't worry.
[173:58.40]That's going to be yours one day.
[174:00.38]Now, when you don that, remember, it comes with a lot of responsibility, son.
[174:07.46]I got enough money.
[174:25.52]Is it a compilation of you crying in car crashes?
[174:28.37]You can't take...
[174:29.62]This isn't...
[174:30.28]Okay.
[174:31.45]Fuck all of you.
[174:32.67]Because let me tell you something.
[174:34.65]You can't just take one thing that happens and say, hey, this is it.
[174:42.17]There's been, I've been on camera and I've been sitting here recorded right now.
[174:45.91]I'm even talking right now.
[174:48.08]Hundreds of thousands of sentences.
[174:50.98]You can't take the one sentence that is me laughing at somebody getting like a car accident in GTA and be like, hey, that's what we're going to show.
[174:58.35]That's it.
[174:58.79]That's what he did.
[175:00.45]There's been 250,000 sentences per year or more.
[175:15.32]How many sentences per stream?
[175:27.20]I don't need this equipped anymore.
[175:35.55]Maybe if you didn't talk so fast.
[175:37.02]Do I talk fast?
[175:40.54]No, I don't.
[175:49.25]traveling clowns.
[175:58.52]Thank you.
[176:02.50]You love to hear yourself talk.
[176:04.60]I actually don't hear myself talk.
[176:05.93]I know a lot of streamers have their own audio in their headphones.
[176:10.70]I can't do it.
[176:11.30]I refuse to do it.
[176:12.19]I hate it.
[176:12.49]So that's incorrect.
[176:21.25]Now they're all rotting away.
[176:22.78]All the clowns.
[176:25.61]Why would you want to hear yourself?
[176:26.72]Because...
[176:28.89]when you have headphones in.
[176:30.40]Actually, this is the problem I have with streaming right now, is when you block the sound,
[176:37.65]It kind of sounds like you're talking underwater in my own head.
[176:41.30]So that's why it sounds like sometimes I might go like that because I actually cannot hear anything coming out of my mouth.
[176:47.61]For the most part.
[176:49.41]Pass-through audio, yeah.
[176:55.26]I can't talk without hearing myself in real life.
[176:59.87]But the digital version of it, because it's usually like a tenth of a second behind your actual voice.
[177:07.97]I get speech jammed by it still.
[177:09.93]I can't do it.
[177:10.85]Even if it's 10 milliseconds, 20 milliseconds, it drives me crazy.
[177:15.28]open back headphones.
[177:16.26]I keep hearing about these and every time I do research, Vinny told me about one.
[177:19.86]I want to talk to Vinny about this because Vinny said there's a pair that I really should get.
[177:25.17]Alright, ready?
[177:25.83]I hope this is worth a hundred bucks.
[177:31.97]The Cage Wood Circus.
[177:35.26]How about a ride?
[177:43.88]I don't have a ticket.
[177:57.79]What's up the dog?
[178:01.26]Welcome to Cagewood Circus.
[178:03.59]You need circus tickets for rides or games.
[178:07.04]If you win any prize tickets, redeem them here.
[178:12.04]Shit, I don't have any money.
[178:23.10]Fancy a spin of the prize wheel?
[178:25.33]It's...
[178:26.17]I forgot me pitch.
[178:27.80]You want to win some prize tickets or not, kid?
[178:30.91]I only have one ticket.
[178:37.77]Fancy gazing into the mysterious mirror?
[178:40.52]We'll show different numbers and then tell me when to stop.
[178:45.39]We'll add each number to stop on to score.
[178:49.78]Closer to get to 21, we'll prize tickets.
[178:52.80]If you land on 21, that's 10 prize tickets.
[178:56.42]If you go over 21, then you're gonna get smoked.
[179:02.15]Okay.
[179:03.50]I need... God damn it.
[179:11.38]Does anything cost one ticket?
[179:16.53]Think that's tough?
[179:18.12]Why not see how much damage you can do in this mannequin in 30 seconds?
[179:22.45]The higher the score, the more prize tickets.
[179:25.49]I'll take the shotgun out.
[179:26.27]I'll win that in seconds.
[179:30.06]Come to see the big show?
[179:40.12]For the pleasure and excitement, we are proud to present the amazing Edgar in Clowns of Verden.
[179:47.22]See a painstakingly recreated trench from the front lines.
[179:51.40]See our very own local hero, Edgar, survive a Jerma clown onslaught.
[179:56.08]Doesn't get any more real than this.
[180:00.19]They should not sell single tickets.
[180:05.26]If I buy one ticket at the counter, I feel like the attendant should say, Oi, everything is two tickets.
[180:11.78]You're not going to be able to do anything, mate.
[180:15.84]I'll go get money.
[180:26.32]We'll keep exploring the cage wood.
[180:29.86]Oh wait, VRJosh, I did some basic math on the 250,000 sentences a year.
[180:34.54]You streamed 504 hours in the last year, according to stats.
[180:39.46]That breaks down to 8.27 sentences per minute.
[180:42.79]Every minute of every stream.
[180:44.90]Dead air would mean you'd need more than that to keep the average up.
[180:48.72]Okay.
[180:52.19]Eight sentences a minute.
[180:59.50]I wonder what your actual sentence per minute really is.
[181:01.67]Yeah, 8.27 sentences per minute.
[181:15.48]Excuse me.
[181:16.96]Get back over here.
[181:23.45]I gotta keep my SPM up.
[181:26.68]Alright.
[181:27.29]Yeah, what the fuck?
[181:29.52]Where'd you go?
[181:30.84]Get back over here, you rotten scoundrel.
[181:33.94]Got it.
[181:34.40]Watch out.
[181:35.76]I gotta get my SPM up.
[181:40.22]There's no reason for you to be doing what you're doing right now.
[181:42.21]Uh, period.
[181:43.77]Next sentence.
[181:45.74]Where'd she go?
[181:46.32]Period.
[181:47.27]Shooting, shooting, shooting.
[181:48.39]That's a sentence.
[181:48.87]Period.
[181:50.78]Backing up.
[181:51.45]Dodging.
[181:51.81]Got hit by that.
[181:52.33]Period.
[181:53.84]Oh my god.
[181:58.88]I can't do that.
[182:00.27]There's way too many...
[182:01.60]Does that count as a sentence?
[182:04.25]Maybe they'll kill each other.
[182:10.98]I'm poisoned!
[182:14.52]Sentence.
[182:16.78]I have to use the shotgun here.
[182:24.19]Those things are crazy!
[182:25.26]Is this loaded?
[182:31.74]Alright, I'm going in there and I'm going to unload.
[182:33.71]Is it going to be worth so much money?
[182:35.38]That's a sentence.
[182:55.89]Oh, by the way, to all the people that called me Elmer Fudd in Sturz chat a couple days ago, uh-uh.
[183:01.49]I completely disagree.
[183:03.53]100% disagree.
[183:05.14]Elmer Fudd is not my personality.
[183:07.65]I just, walking out of the shotgun like this just kind of made me think about it.
[183:11.85]There is no, and people agreed with this take.
[183:14.84]No chance.
[183:16.12]No shot.
[183:16.64]No chance in hell.
[183:17.95]Absolutely not.
[183:18.75]Elmer Fudd.
[183:19.76]Oh, shut up.
[183:20.90]I wish I could talk in that stream.
[183:27.32]Elmer Fudd's SPM is like 3.
[183:29.89]No, no, it's like 1.
[183:31.98]It might even be .5.
[183:35.33]You think I'm Elmer Fudd?
[183:37.21]Whoa, where's that wabbit?
[183:41.61]Whoa.
[183:44.68]What, 0.2 SPM?
[183:46.65]Goodbye.
[184:00.30]Holy shit!
[184:06.84]That's fine, just keep doing that.
[184:26.15]Oh, that wascally wabbit.
[184:45.52]No, I want it to reload!
[185:00.04]Stop that.
[185:04.87]Stop it.
[185:07.21]Quit back dodge rolling.
[185:08.74]What is this?
[185:09.46]Dark Souls PvP.
[185:16.74]I don't want to die.
[185:24.50]Okay, this had better have been worth it.
[185:30.09]Horse girl.
[185:34.31]Uh...
[185:39.56]I mean, that's 20 bucks per... and a super chest or whatever's in it.
[185:47.20]Okay.
[185:50.48]They were crazy.
[185:51.36]I used all of my shotgun bullets on that nonsense.
[186:05.31]World of Warcraft girlfriend or VRChat love affair?
[186:13.26]I don't know.
[186:14.41]That's an interesting one.
[186:15.31]I'm going to say
[186:24.44]Okay, is world of...
[186:26.88]These are both implying that you will not see them, right?
[186:30.64]This is only digital?
[186:44.24]If it's only digital,
[186:50.99]Wait, what is this?
[186:52.06]Very old key to the buildings along Labyrinth Market Street.
[186:54.75]Ooh.
[186:59.73]I feel like, okay, what VRChat love affair, not just like VRChat love session.
[187:07.48]Do you know what I'm saying?
[187:08.64]Like, what do you mean affair?
[187:09.57]Affair.
[187:11.41]You've got to explain that a little more.
[187:20.44]Like, what do you mean by love affair?
[187:22.65]Like, just a, I want clarification on that statement.
[187:30.07]You make it weird?
[187:31.20]No, I just said, like, okay, World of Warcraft girlfriend, I know that, I understand that.
[187:35.64]You log in, it's like, ding, oh, hey.
[187:40.18]oh, hey, yeah, I got some gold for you.
[187:42.17]Like, okay, whatever.
[187:43.86]And let's, I don't know, but what do you mean by VRChat love affair?
[187:48.53]I know what World of Warcraft girlfriend is.
[187:52.87]You don't know what an affair is.
[187:53.89]I just mean, like, you could define that as something.
[187:56.85]Holly just said session.
[187:58.02]Ew.
[187:59.53]I need clarification.
[188:00.95]I need a clarification statement of what you mean by love affair.
[188:05.44]Are you talking about like just one day in a VRChat scenario?
[188:09.89]Or are you talking about like, it's a, you didn't say VRChat girlfriend.
[188:19.21]Uh, this is scary.
[188:24.68]An affair implies a long-term secret relationship.
[188:27.99]You see, that is what I'm talking about.
[188:30.30]What do you mean by that?
[188:31.64]It could mean like, oh, a love affair.
[188:33.63]You just kind of...
[188:34.67]It's a fling.
[188:35.74]Or is it like, oh, this is not good.
[188:38.07]I'm not answering that without clarification from the original author.
[188:45.64]Love session is an unk term.
[188:57.97]An affair is never a good thing.
[188:59.92]I'm just, I have my own version of what an affair, yeah, exactly.
[189:05.22]I'm going to go with World of Warcraft Girlfriend.
[189:09.52]World of Warcraft girlfriend?
[189:13.33]I can imagine logging in and like, oh, I got mail.
[189:18.25]There's mail up there in the mini map.
[189:22.29]What did I get?
[189:24.31]Oh, I got like a little gift.
[189:26.10]And it's...
[189:27.57]a green belt that was like +2 strength on it because like I was I need strength on my warrior
[189:32.95]you sent it to me and you sent me like a couple of potions and stuff and it's like oh here's the thought you'd need this smiley with a wink face World of Warcraft girlfriend 100
[189:57.81]Alright, I need to go buy stuff.
[190:00.28]Because I'm not going in there.
[190:15.75]World of Warcraft daughter or Final Fantasy XIV son?
[190:18.65]World of Warcraft daughter!
[190:19.98]Every fucking time!
[190:28.93]Moaning Myrtle's son or Hagrid's daughter?
[190:31.50]Hagrid's daughter!
[190:42.63]question was.
[190:45.29]I saw another one.
[190:46.13]I read it.
[190:46.92]No, I know that.
[190:48.00]Yeah, absolutely.
[190:57.67]Lucius Malfoyle's son or Voldemort daughter?
[191:03.21]That's a Malfoyle son.
[191:04.32]I don't want a Voldemort daughter.
[191:05.48]Fuck that.
[191:13.46]Dark Souls 1 son or Dark Souls 2 daughter?
[191:15.64]Dark Souls 2 daughter.
[191:17.52]That's a more whimsical world.
[191:34.10]Coke son or Coke daughter?
[191:36.77]Are we talking about the drink?
[191:40.97]Or are we talking about the drug?
[191:48.11]Are we talking about Coca-Cola son and Coke daughter?
[191:51.06]Or are we talking about Coke son and Coca-Cola daughter?
[192:03.46]No, I gotta go in here.
[192:04.71]You guys are distracting me.
[192:09.30]Revealed upon your decision on this.
[192:11.37]Um...
[192:15.39]Why do I not want to pick Coca-Cola Sun?
[192:17.99]That, you know what I'm saying?
[192:19.02]Like, I don't...
[192:21.70]Coca-Cola Son sounds like a pretty boring fucking guy.
[192:25.95]I'm sorry, I'm just gonna say it.
[192:34.70]But I don't know if that's like the thing that's tied to your personality.
[192:37.53]Like I'm the Coca-Cola guy, Coca-Cola.
[192:41.44]It's like, dude, what the fuck is wrong with you, dude?
[192:43.61]Like, what are you talking about?
[192:44.69]Like, you care that much about Coca-Cola?
[192:47.91]No, you don't.
[192:48.61]It's just a drink, dude.
[192:49.59]Relax.
[192:59.00]I don't think I can pick Coca-Cola Sun.
[193:02.27]I'm not sure that I can do that.
[193:05.75]There's way more to life.
[193:09.46]than being Coca-Cola's son.
[193:13.24]And it's weird because if you said Coca-Cola's son's sprite daughter,
[193:18.03]that I don't I don't think I can answer it because I think they're both weirdos
[193:32.17]He's picking the drugs over the...
[193:40.16]What the hell even is a Coca-Cola?
[193:41.44]That's what I'm saying.
[193:42.08]I don't know either.
[193:42.75]I'm making it- I'm inferring for what that would be.
[193:49.03]Thank you.
[193:54.82]Remember when you had normal conversations?
[193:57.05]I think we had a...
[193:57.98]Okay, we just had like a very deep, normal conversation.
[194:00.97]It was like 10 minutes ago.
[194:05.25]Okay, I need bullets.
[194:09.45]We're gonna make some... What do I have for heals right now?
[194:14.73]Because this is a boss coming up.
[194:16.82]I have plenty.
[194:17.27]Alright, I've got this.
[194:18.01]Let me put these here.
[194:21.47]I've got plenty of food.
[194:25.33]B.A.P.
[194:37.67]Don't answer these questions.
[194:38.53]You're making enemies with powerful, weird people.
[194:42.92]The Coca-Cola Sun?
[194:46.10]I feel like a Coca-Cola son would look down at his desk right now, surrounded by Coca-Cola.
[194:53.21]Coca-Cola poster behind him.
[194:55.10]Coca-Cola, the Santa.
[194:56.43]You know, this Coca-Cola Santa.
[194:58.22]He's sitting on his desk.
[194:59.30]He's got three open bottles.
[195:00.83]He's got Coke Zero, Coke Diet Coke, and a regular Coke sitting on his desk.
[195:04.14]All different bottles, by the way.
[195:05.89]Glass bottle for the Coke.
[195:07.45]aluminum can for the Diet Coke and then out of a cup for the Coke Zero.
[195:14.96]And he's dressed in all red.
[195:17.13]And I bet you...
[195:17.69]I think that dude looks down, looks up, looks down, and just goes...
[195:22.96]Yeah.
[195:24.63]Yeah.
[195:25.45]Yep.
[195:27.69]I think that that person's very reasonable.
[195:39.09]with a mini fridge?
[195:51.65]Egg white son or yolk daughter?
[195:53.39]Uh, uh, yolk.
[196:07.58]I hope this is real, because this is great.
[196:09.85]This is like why you stream, right?
[196:11.72]This is like why I like to stream.
[196:14.11]in a sea of fucking, you know, all kinds of bullshit.
[196:16.88]This is what does it for me.
[196:19.12]I have to be honest, Coke went to my school a few weeks ago and gave me a bunch of branded merch, so I have it all in front of me,
[196:26.09]and have never felt more disappointed in myself than when you've said all of that.
[196:34.86]There was a Coca-Cola sign in the chat room.
[196:41.44]But he didn't want...
[196:43.54]Okay, there's a difference.
[196:45.47]Taking a bag of branded merch from some guy with like a bright
[196:48.89]fucking white teeth smile that's like, hey man, here's some Coca-Cola merchandise, dude.
[196:53.27]Hey, welcome to the brand.
[196:54.88]That's not Coca-Cola, son.
[196:56.61]You took a bag.
[196:57.83]You literally grabbed a bag out of somebody's hands.
[197:00.06]I disagree.
[197:04.38]I completely disagree.
[197:05.96]No, you're fine.
[197:06.71]You're totally good.
[197:08.49]You are one... You are... You are fine.
[197:14.30]Hey, was it like a good bag?
[197:15.87]Hey, the bag might have been good.
[197:16.96]Was it a cool hat?
[197:17.75]Yeah, the hat's fine.
[197:25.12]He's doing damage control?
[197:27.05]No!
[197:27.27]That's an incredible difference to make!
[197:31.33]But still...
[197:35.33]Alright, I'm gonna go back to playing the game.
[197:45.43]Coca-Cola, son.
[197:52.84]Alright, does anybody have a...
[197:55.10]glass Coca-Cola bottle painting in their room.
[198:00.69]I feel like that's a made up, like, boy's room.
[198:03.95]Do you know what I'm saying?
[198:04.92]That's like a made up boy's room.
[198:07.69]That's like on the wall in a made-up college boys' room.
[198:13.39]That actually would kind of go hard.
[198:14.56]That would be pretty cool, wouldn't it?
[198:17.73]Fuck, that's actually awesome.
[198:19.62]Just like a glass bottle of Coca-Cola just sitting there, just in a painting frame.
[198:23.99]I feel like that, dude, why do you have, that's cool, man.
[198:28.53]That's a sitcom.
[198:30.06]Yeah.
[198:34.42]Alright, I gotta go fight this boss.
[198:39.77]After I do this.
[198:42.51]How much money do I have?
[198:45.68]Enough.
[198:51.50]I'm reading chat.
[198:57.45]Does duct tape a banana to the wall?
[199:09.10]I know someone that collects Coke stuff, they have a room full of that shit.
[199:15.38]Yeah, okay, but hold on.
[199:17.37]I don't think collecting memorabilia makes you a Coca-Cola son.
[199:23.43]Drinking a case of Coca-Cola in an afternoon is what makes you a Coca-Cola-san.
[199:28.42]Having it all, having like bottles.
[199:29.85]Oh, this is like a 1950s bottle of Coca-Cola.
[199:32.43]This is 1960s bottle of Coca-Cola.
[199:34.34]This is like a vintage glass.
[199:35.34]branded thing.
[199:36.75]That's collecting memorabilia.
[199:38.28]That's not being a Coca-Cola son.
[199:51.34]Okay, I should have enough.
[199:58.36]I need to permanently up... Where's that guy with the permanent upgrades?
[200:03.02]Sports betting son or Disney adult daughter?
[200:06.42]That was from a mod, by the way.
[200:15.27]Alright.
[200:20.75]Dude, I'm going to have a Disney adult daughter.
[200:23.44]I don't know, sports betting son, I feel like that could go down a bad path.
[200:29.61]but okay does Disney adult daughter sing the songs in the house do you know what I'm saying like is it like do I wake up in the morning and it's like
[200:39.40]There goes the baker with the baking tray.
[200:43.23]Like, I don't know, man.
[200:44.64]I might feel like it's, I wish the sun was the sports better.
[200:55.75]But what if Sports Betting Son is like, hey, no, no, no, dad, dad, dad, the fucking Patriots this year suck dick.
[201:04.04]And let me tell you something,
[201:05.62]I got a fucking plan.
[201:07.92]And what if he wins like fucking $50 million?
[201:29.15]She won't move out of your house until she gets married to Mickey Mouse.
[201:33.27]But you misspelled it as... Mickle Mouse?
[201:46.46]Oh no, is it a capital I?
[201:50.73]You need to get married to Michael Mouse.
[201:53.52]Alright.
[201:54.00]I feel like we've been off track for like 30 straight minutes, guys.
[201:58.04]We got to get back on track here.
[202:00.21]I gotta get back on track.
[202:04.04]If you're wondering how a, like, 20-hour playthrough turns into a 30- or 40-hour stream, this is how it happens.
[202:10.35]We go off track big time.
[202:12.11]I'm gonna put, I'm gonna get us back on the railway.
[202:18.17]Who gives a shit about that anyways?
[202:19.64]Alright.
[202:20.88]I want to...
[202:23.57]I need money.
[202:26.89]I could level up like 10 times.
[202:41.41]Alright.
[202:42.41]I'm ready to fight whatever's over there.
[202:51.94]Alright, we're going to the basement of the cathedral because that is where the witch is.
[202:58.58]And we're going to see if we can kill the witch.
[203:04.12]I wish I had money.
[203:07.07]So I could do this other shit, but I don't.
[203:09.73]Okay.
[203:14.95]There also was the roof, but I don't even, how do I get over to the roof from here?
[203:32.10]What do I have for projectiles?
[203:37.68]Hold on.
[203:38.04]Give me a second.
[203:40.45]Do you ever feel like you're losing your Boston accent?
[203:44.22]I think it comes and goes depending on what's going on.
[203:49.66]I think I've been just so used to talking to trying to talk with, you know, the projecting and speak.
[203:56.70]I've been doing that for so long that
[203:59.81]And when you get away from that area too,
[204:04.75]You kind of lose the accent of wherever you are from, because you're not hearing it all the time around you.
[204:15.11]Alright, so to do, what do I want to do here?
[204:16.82]I wanted to go here.
[204:24.46]Where's the church?
[204:25.14]The church is out this way?
[204:31.83]Yes, okay.
[204:36.24]See if we can kill the witch.
[204:45.39]There's no boss here, right?
[204:47.19]I already did it.
[205:02.50]Hello.
[205:06.06]I only have one of these.
[205:07.06]It's worth getting another one.
[205:19.71]Okay, here we go.
[205:20.31]Cemetery.
[205:26.09]I'm ready to fight whatever it is.
[205:29.19]Oh, I already did it.
[205:30.50]Cool.
[205:30.94]Right.
[205:33.41]Okay, now...
[205:34.78]It's down in the basement, is where the witch is, apparently.
[205:50.20]Oh, God.
[205:57.42]Hmm.
[206:04.88]The metal door has no handle.
[206:06.73]I have to open it.
[206:10.13]How do you open the door?
[206:22.57]Oh, here we go.
[206:27.51]Alright.
[206:29.24]Here we go!
[206:34.72]Oh, my gosh.
[206:46.80]Freeze!
[206:52.24]This is the end of chapter three.
[206:54.00]Oh, wait a minute.
[206:55.81]Hold on.
[206:57.54]There's other shit we didn't do.
[207:01.45]We didn't do the carnival.
[207:05.32]I'll be back.
[207:15.52]48 to 72 business hours son or 2 to 5 business days daughter?
[207:19.87]48 to 72 business hours son.
[207:27.05]I like how that I like that a little better.
[207:36.36]I want to do this.
[207:39.97]I want to go back to the carnival.
[207:45.64]Okay, I need to farm some money for a minute.
[207:50.37]What's the best way to do that?
[207:51.84]We're gonna get money right now.
[208:01.57]I could go up to the attic.
[208:03.29]I feel like there's a lot of money to make up there.
[208:06.23]I ran away from there a long time ago.
[208:18.97]I like the new son or daughter bit.
[208:21.46]Well, it's not new.
[208:24.70]Like I said, this is something that I've seen Moon Moon's community do many times.
[208:29.37]So, this is not something that is new here.
[208:32.16]Well, I mean it's pretty new here, but...
[208:36.29]I've seen it in other streamers chats before.
[208:40.38]It's very old.
[208:44.42]Okay, I need to make some money.
[209:01.28]That's a lot of fucking damage that that guy just did to me.
[209:10.29]Don't do this to me now.
[209:11.37]I'm just trying to farm.
[209:12.34]I'm just trying to farm.
[209:13.24]I'm dead.
[209:17.47]Holy shit, I can't believe I survived this.
[209:26.00]Not after I just survived it!
[209:28.84]I'm in trouble, big time.
[209:29.75]Gotta run.
[209:37.56]Holy shit.
[209:39.03]Oh my god, thank goodness.
[209:41.76]Alright, if this was for money, I just got a bunch.
[209:49.95]Permanent left hand?
[209:54.27]A burnt, foul-smelling cloth doll?
[209:58.06]Oh.
[210:00.27]Blocks 90% of all damage from all sides.
[210:04.39]But you take 20 curse damage a second.
[210:09.50]That's kind of crazy.
[210:11.10]Did you get a bunch of curse resistance?
[210:13.41]You're just invincible.
[210:21.13]I thought I was gonna die there.
[210:22.10]That would have been really bad.
[210:24.92]Very, very bad.
[210:29.57]But, do what we gotta do, right?
[210:36.88]Bullets are expensive, so I'm gonna switch to these for now.
[210:48.89]Place a Curse Candle at your feet and basically resist 90%.
[210:51.92]That's a good thing to test, that's true.
[211:00.01]Okay.
[211:01.52]It's in my left hand, right?
[211:04.53]Don't hold it up yet.
[211:05.33]Okay, let me try it.
[211:16.23]if I put on all the curse damage stuff the resist stuff it would be great
[211:27.43]Mmm, that... No, it's working.
[211:34.32]If you have not a whole lot of curse already, that works pretty well.
[211:38.15]And if I have like a 30% curse resist ring, 20% curse resist chest, it would be pretty good.
[211:46.08]That's kind of a good oh shit moment anyways, though, because it gives you a second to take no damage for a second.
[211:53.25]I don't know.
[211:53.59]That seems kind of good.
[212:04.25]That was an insane reach.
[212:10.62]I never killed these guys up here, but they are worth a lot.
[212:14.67]Yeah, 26.
[212:18.71]They give you a ton of shit too.
[212:23.51]I'll make 100, 200 gold just by doing this.
[212:41.46]It's cool, but I already had one.
[212:48.36]Back in here.
[212:50.85]I'm going to actually try to clear the attic.
[212:57.80]What am I shooting?
[212:59.07]What direction am I shooting?
[213:01.36]What the fuck just happened?
[213:22.33]I almost got it.
[213:24.50]It almost hit me.
[213:27.23]Okay, you're dead.
[213:27.83]Any other idiots up here?
[213:36.59]What?
[213:42.58]Wait, what?
[213:45.45]Now that's a callback.
[213:59.53]Do I have any grenades or anything?
[214:05.99]I feel like this is the, this is where these, yeah, these guys, oh, whoops.
[214:09.57]And I don't, didn't even take damage.
[214:11.90]Wonderful.
[214:24.82]Good?
[214:28.76]Okay, this is what I'm talking about
[214:34.51]You can't even... Oh, you know what?
[214:36.27]You got burnt.
[214:36.72]You're good.
[214:43.07]Dead?
[214:43.62]Dead.
[214:45.14]Good.
[215:00.43]Critical ring?
[215:01.20]I think I already had it.
[215:05.96]I just looked over.
[215:06.67]People are still writing the this or that.
[215:09.72]This or that son or daughter.
[215:13.43]How many have been here?
[215:14.53]I haven't even looked.
[215:21.91]This place is a fucking disaster.
[215:29.78]I need a camera.
[215:38.33]Hey!
[215:38.78]Why did I give it all back?
[215:53.23]There's money to be made in here.
[215:55.03]There really is.
[215:59.61]I can't see, though.
[216:02.41]Alright, there's a guy I need to take a picture of that was...
[216:04.51]I think he was in the wheelchair?
[216:10.71]Where is he?
[216:12.92]Oh my god, there he is.
[216:13.78]Did I get ya?
[216:17.12]Got him.
[216:29.53]I don't have any more?
[216:30.43]This is bad.
[216:32.32]What missed?
[216:43.05]Stop!
[216:44.67]Uh-oh!
[217:01.07]38-year-old son or 41-year-old daughter?
[217:03.46]Alright, now you're just being... now you're just being stupid.
[217:16.68]Now you're just being stupid.
[217:29.35]I kind of am out of everything.
[217:30.58]This might be a run-through get item scenario.
[217:34.18]Because I got a lot of money, don't I?
[217:36.44]Alright, I have a hundred bucks.
[217:37.58]That's enough to buy everything I want to buy.
[217:38.97]The tickets at the carnival.
[217:42.50]Okay.
[217:43.53]I'm gonna run through here and just collect items and run away.
[217:50.46]And go.
[217:51.57]Good.
[218:01.87]coin purse good okay run out out out out out out out out out out
[218:27.43]You made some gnocchi soup?
[218:29.87]Ooh.
[218:35.48]I think I'm good to leave.
[218:37.11]The rest is just me dying here.
[218:38.28]This- that attic's way too scary.
[218:44.31]Although I could just go into the prison.
[218:47.58]Alright, last run through and then I'm gonna sneeze into the mic accidentally without being able to mute.
[218:55.45]Okay, we got that out of the way.
[219:12.15]Anything to give me more items.
[219:14.66]Good.
[219:15.73]Good.
[219:16.69]Ten bucks.
[219:17.62]Yep.
[219:18.56]Excellent.
[219:19.83]Excellent.
[219:20.59]I missed something, but whatever.
[219:26.54]Oh yeah, it's this guy.
[219:28.09]Forgot about this guy.
[219:41.57]Damn.
[219:43.37]Damn.
[219:48.19]Holy shit.
[219:50.43]Can I see some projectile rolls in this seed, please?
[219:58.12]It's kind of a load of shit, isn't it?
[220:08.08]Hey, you introduced me to this game and announced my favorite game of all time.
[220:10.83]I thought you played this game off stream.
[220:12.70]I did.
[220:14.29]But it's been a year or two, so I kind of forgot everything.
[220:16.24]So I said, hey, you know what?
[220:17.21]I really want to play that again.
[220:19.28]I figured it would be a good chill game to play on stream.
[220:27.60]Okay, now...
[220:31.18]Let's get out of here.
[220:43.51]Craft some... How?
[220:47.73]Craft some bullets.
[220:51.02]Is there a better way for me to get over here?
[220:54.70]I don't think so.
[220:56.28]Yeah, there is the stairwell.
[221:16.59]Alright, that's a ton.
[221:18.14]Look at how much damage that is now.
[221:19.69]I got lots of bullets.
[221:20.54]I got 40 bucks.
[221:23.64]I'm ready to go buy tickets at the amusement park.
[221:34.33]And then I can go kill the witch.
[221:42.09]Here we go.
[222:00.30]It's this way, right?
[222:03.53]Be careful if you explore the cage wood.
[222:05.71]Mad witches have bound many a poor soul into those cages.
[222:08.89]Each night they'd wake up, cut themselves to ribbons trying to escape, and die again.
[222:13.68]Just skeletons remain now, a mercy.
[222:22.64]Hey, do you peel the wax off first?
[222:26.14]Of a baby bell cheese.
[222:29.46]Yes.
[222:30.36]I mean, you take the whole thing out.
[222:33.48]You take the whole thing out and you eat it like a cookie.
[222:45.59]Alright, let me buy some tickets.
[222:52.56]Alright, I have eight tickets.
[222:55.17]Let's go do everything.
[222:56.62]Start at the very end.
[223:03.24]Spin the number.
[223:04.99]Here we go.
[223:05.57]Alright, here we go.
[223:06.15]What are we doing here?
[223:11.22]Ten.
[223:13.13]That's it?
[223:19.03]That game's dumb.
[223:21.47]Alright, what about this one?
[223:22.69]Look into the mirror.
[223:25.50]You got a zero.
[223:28.72]Okay, so now it's 7.
[223:30.65]Now I have a total of...
[223:31.57]I gotta get a 21.
[223:32.11]14.
[223:35.55]You always hit on... You hit that.
[223:38.71]I did it.
[223:41.63]I just did it.
[223:42.36]I win 10 tickets.
[223:52.80]You want a ride?
[223:53.49]He just gave me a free prize ticket.
[223:57.59]Sure, I'll ride it.
[224:13.63]I look really unimpressed.
[224:16.40]Here's your prize!
[224:17.13]Oh, it's just, it's uh...
[224:18.82]It's free tickets.
[224:21.89]No gambling required.
[224:23.02]You just have to ride the ride.
[224:23.84]This one is due damage.
[224:29.04]Do I have shotgun bullets?
[224:30.17]I don't want to waste my bullets, though.
[224:38.11]This one was expensive.
[224:38.98]What was this one?
[224:39.45]Five?
[224:40.18]Shit.
[224:49.72]What can you exchange here?
[224:58.19]Doll.
[224:59.66]Scone.
[225:01.28]Comforting bear.
[225:03.15]Teddy bear enchanted to gradually drain the holder of cursedness.
[225:09.23]What if you had the teddy bear in one hand and then the other thing in the other hand?
[225:18.95]Um, I want that.
[225:23.21]Dog Whistle, an old whistle enchanted to transport Horus the dog to nowhere.
[225:29.39]After his previous owner's mine rotted away, Horace was taken in by a witch.
[225:33.59]She trained him to bark at ghosts, illusions, and hexes.
[225:36.65]Whenever Horus is gravely injured or hears this whistle, he will safely return to know its companion.
[225:42.15]Alright.
[225:42.59]Yep.
[225:43.09]I remember.
[225:44.56]You can get a companion.
[225:46.10]I need more.
[225:48.25]Oh, hold on.
[225:55.15]Okay, we're going to have to come back here because I want these four things.
[226:00.05]We're going to be at the carnival for a while.
[226:11.97]Give me ten.
[226:13.92]Or at least three.
[226:15.02]I need more tickets.
[226:19.86]Shit, I need more money.
[226:24.81]Damn it.
[226:26.86]Alright, I can make money right now.
[226:30.80]Base projectile damage is huge, I know.
[226:35.68]You're right.
[226:39.37]We've gotta come back with money.
[226:49.63]Think I already killed everything over here, though.
[226:59.02]Kind of.
[227:02.49]Oh wait, it's the hidden chain.
[227:03.86]Okay, let me see how dangerous this thing is.
[227:05.58]Whatever it is, it's a boss.
[227:06.38]I don't know what it is though.
[227:18.56]Yeah.
[227:20.04]Okay, so what is it then?
[227:23.25]Skeleton wearing a soiled green cloak and horse skull mask.
[227:26.82]Take the outfit.
[227:29.04]Not yet, hold on.
[227:43.40]$4.
[227:46.55]Three notched wheels, each with 10 possible settings.
[227:49.46]Alright, there's a code here.
[227:51.67]I don't remember what this is, but I'm gonna open all these.
[227:59.26]A set of rusty copper pipes and a schematic for improving the Byzantine labyrinth organ chamber.
[228:04.14]Oh yeah.
[228:13.33]Alright, I'll take the clothes.
[228:16.01]But wait.
[228:18.16]Okay, now do that again because I want to keep that item.
[228:20.39]It might not be rolled the same way.
[228:29.30]Nightmother's Mask.
[228:32.94]Okay.
[228:35.03]Green Cloak.
[228:39.51]Spell casting shit.
[228:42.79]Um... Well, I don't know the code to this.
[228:55.15]Is the code the number of coffins?
[229:00.05]Hold on.
[229:08.01]There's three numbers.
[229:16.03]I don't know.
[229:22.86]I guess it would be... Yeah, 1, 2, 3, and then there's a break.
[229:26.90]1, and then 3.
[229:28.44]Maybe there's 3.
[229:29.21]1, 3.
[229:34.79]Aw, man.
[229:35.91]Nope.
[229:51.38]Yeah, there's a symbol right here.
[229:52.38]I don't know what that means particularly.
[229:54.39]What if it was 312 because this one's occupied?
[230:05.74]Just dumb enough to work.
[230:14.57]Hmm.
[230:16.44]Does it have a description?
[230:17.64]No.
[230:26.34]Maybe there's other rooms with other coffins.
[230:27.67]I actually don't think I ever did this.
[230:30.29]I don't remember solving that one.
[230:31.46]I don't think I did it.
[230:34.78]Alright, well, that doesn't solve our immediate for, I need money.
[230:43.89]I need a lot.
[230:44.40]I need like a hundred.
[230:45.20]Okay, I'm gonna come...
[230:46.77]Slow down.
[230:47.25]I'm gonna come back here with a hundred gold.
[230:57.53]I want all that stuff.
[231:03.53]That's not Elmer Fudd, that's Porky Pig.
[231:06.78]And I would rather be Porky Pig than Elmer Fudd.
[231:19.75]I could go on a total selling spree.
[231:27.03]The Merry Band was originally started by witches.
[231:29.28]The core members were called Trickster Initiates.
[231:32.14]forced to incinerate themselves every night to protect Mostyn House.
[231:36.84]Little wonder they developed such a distrust of authority.
[231:47.51]I need your blessing from my Elden Ring item farm, please.
[231:53.45]What do you farm in an Elden Ring?
[232:00.32]Yeah, I'm gonna go on a selling spree.
[232:17.62]Pray, pray, bless him.
[232:21.09]You got at least five people.
[232:27.96]He reminds me of like the... You guys know Dan Henschel?
[232:31.95]He did a video one time where it's like...
[232:34.12]prayer service and he puts his hands up and he's like, please lean in.
[232:37.71]It's like...
[232:40.69]It does like this big thing on the screen and it's like, he just blessed you.
[232:45.63]It's fucking hilarious.
[232:55.89]I don't want to spend any money.
[233:03.74]Alright, selling spree, everything must go.
[233:13.76]everything must go
[233:28.96]Bye.
[233:48.05]Everything must go.
[233:51.31]Everything must go.
[234:11.66]Everything has to go.
[234:16.63]No, I don't want to sell the unique rings though.
[234:21.95]Physical damage is interesting, but I don't know.
[234:24.28]Everything has to go.
[234:30.66]No, I'm not going to use this ever.
[234:34.93]Speed's good, but I'm probably not going to use it ever.
[234:39.41]But why get rid of it if you think you could use it at some point?
[234:43.75]Okay, that's how many tickets is that?
[234:45.40]It's a lot of tickets, I think.
[234:48.77]Hold on, I think I can sell something down here.
[234:50.34]Yeah, there's a lot of other things I can get rid of too.
[234:54.54]I'm not gonna use a torch or anything, it's fine.
[235:02.69]Uh...
[235:05.57]Where's the guy I can sell this?
[235:09.65]Where's the guy I can sell that to?
[235:12.64]Alright.
[235:13.39]70 bucks.
[235:16.48]I'm ready.
[235:24.10]Desperate old man is desperate to keep his viewers here, so he does a funny voice.
[235:38.04]So what?
[235:44.35]Bring back grandpa?
[235:48.03]Hey everybody, it's me, Grandpa!
[235:49.96]And today, I'm gonna be playing at Call of Duty!
[235:54.36]I can do it better than that.
[235:56.89]Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
[236:01.35]And this is a crazy game.
[236:04.32]Did you know that you can play this game and you can use a controller?
[236:09.94]Dude... What the fuck?
[236:12.13]I can't... See, it's been years.
[236:27.70]Did Grandpa ever get a nuke?
[236:29.79]And cod?
[236:30.36]No.
[236:35.59]I'll tell you, there's a grandpa video.
[236:36.92]I think, I don't even know it's still on my channel.
[236:39.38]where it's Grandpa plays Super Meat Boy and it's the Dark World, I think, whatever it's called, or was it Bandage Girl or something?
[236:48.48]And it's like a two minute video.
[236:50.28]And the whole thing is he's like, oh, it's me, Grandpa.
[236:52.51]And today we're going to be playing Super Meat Boy.
[236:55.89]I thought it was funny while I was making the video.
[236:59.54]It's an introduction and then the first jump he misses, he throws his controller through a glass window.
[237:05.77]I was like, oh, that's kind of funny.
[237:06.94]Like, you instantly get that mad and you ruin everything and you have to stop.
[237:10.61]And I remember watching it back and I was like, this video, like, sucks.
[237:15.01]But I uploaded it anyways and I kind of like it years later.
[237:35.96]Go hide in a coffin in the hidden chamber.
[237:39.20]Oh, spoiler Andy.
[237:41.01]I played this game before, I know.
[237:42.95]I knew that.
[237:45.97]Fifteen tickets.
[237:54.68]Oh, you got yourself a 500 tickets there.
[237:58.34]Spin the wheel.
[237:59.14]Oh, a thousand tickets.
[238:02.44]Let's go fishing.
[238:03.28]Oh, yeah.
[238:03.67]Oh, wow.
[238:04.07]You got a thousand tickets there.
[238:09.89]200 tickets.
[238:13.53]Should I do this now?
[238:17.86]No.
[238:17.94]Here's the video right here.
[238:23.48]Um...
[238:37.51]Give me one second.
[238:45.44]Let's see if this video holds up.
[238:47.50]We're going to do a live critique.
[239:03.36]This video is two minutes and 17 seconds.
[239:13.28]Is this video even 1080p?
[239:14.55]720p, it's, this is a, this is back when that was a big deal.
[239:25.01]Can you hear it?
[239:28.44]Oh, dude, it's my intro.
[239:31.99]Alright, I'm going to turn it up.
[239:34.06]Let's critique the video.
[239:51.84]I already hated.
[239:57.47]Hello there, ladies and gentlemen.
[239:59.38]It's Grandpa here.
[240:00.83]And if you're wondering why I'm being a little bit on the quiet side, it's because Jeremy doesn't know I'm in here.
[240:07.57]and I saw him play this game the other day, and I asked him nicely if I could play it, and he told me, no, Grandpa,
[240:15.69]You can't do that.
[240:16.97]Because your heart is too... You're gonna have a heart attack.
[240:20.06]And I told him, fuck you.
[240:21.25]And he said, fuck me.
[240:22.58]And then I said, fuck you to fuck me?
[240:24.76]And that's how it ended, but I'm not supposed to be in his room.
[240:28.22]So don't fucking say anything.
[240:30.49]If I hear any of you guys tell him that I did this, it would be really bad.
[240:33.98]Engagement bait.
[240:43.95]But let's just go, let's get started here.
[240:46.42]Cotton Alley.
[240:49.44]Okay, now if I remember correctly,
[240:52.05]You're supposed to jump over these saw blades.
[240:55.24]Just like this.
[240:56.79]This controller sucks.
[241:01.18]Oh no.
[241:03.41]What was that?
[241:05.26]Are you alright?
[241:06.33]I just heard a crash.
[241:07.33]Are you okay?
[241:07.90]What happened?
[241:08.42]Yeah, I'm okay.
[241:09.97]The seagull just ran into the window.
[241:13.94]It was ridiculous.
[241:14.98]What?
[241:15.40]He went full speed.
[241:16.77]He was looking at me right in my eyes.
[241:18.41]And I said, you better not come over here, Seagull, or I'm going to get really fucking mad at you.
[241:22.95]And he said, yeah, I'm going to get you.
[241:24.81]I'm going to bite you.
[241:25.83]And he flew into the window and broke it.
[241:27.96]Can't believe it.
[241:28.85]Hold on, a bird flew into the window?
[241:30.57]That's... Yeah.
[241:32.82]What is my controller doing over here on the ground?
[241:34.83]You did that.
[241:35.95]You must have done that.
[241:36.88]I didn't do anything.
[241:37.56]You threw this into the window.
[241:39.38]We live in the woods.
[241:40.95]There's no seagulls.
[241:42.58]Go get a broom.
[241:44.54]I'll clean it up.
[241:45.35]Jeez, what do you want?
[241:46.17]I'll get the fucking broom.
[241:47.38]I can't believe you did this.
[241:48.64]You've never broken a fucking window before because you're super mean.
[241:52.08]Thank you for proving the reason why I banned you from this room Who throws a controller into a window?
[242:07.42]I got to the end of that video and I'm like, like when I was making it, I just, I have a vivid memory of this.
[242:14.90]I was like, this video is two minutes.
[242:17.51]And I didn't want to actually play Super Meat Boy Cotton Alley because I was like, this is way too hard.
[242:26.23]And...
[242:27.06]I'm going to be so mad.
[242:28.20]This is going to fuck up my whole life if I actually try to beat this while recording it.
[242:34.15]So my solution was, I'm just going to do this.
[242:38.26]And look, I played Cotton Alley, technically.
[242:43.06]Here's my Cotton Alley video.
[242:45.33]Because in my mind, this video has 82,000 views.
[242:50.33]If I had played Cotton Alley and like hated my life for like 12 hours trying to play it, that video would have 82,000 views.
[242:59.14]Right.
[242:59.46]It would be like the same amount of people would watch it.
[243:01.42]So I guess grandpa's going to throw something through a window.
[243:12.30]Now it's going to get 200,000 views.
[243:14.43]13 years ago.
[243:18.79]What was the day this was uploaded?
[243:20.43]The actual day.
[243:23.22]August 19, 2012.
[243:24.42]That's crazy.
[243:34.83]Grandpa.
[243:40.54]Alright, I need tickets.
[243:43.33]Give it more- No, don't give it more views.
[243:45.40]I want- Give it less views.
[243:51.80]I was 12.
[244:03.21]Imagine if the video did really well, like 3 million views, and you shifted entirely into Grandpa.
[244:08.27]I mean, I...
[244:09.88]A lot of the reason why I started getting a lot of traction on early YouTube was because of Grandpa.
[244:16.02]Some of you old heads.
[244:18.57]will remember that if you got your video on Machinima Respawn 10-15 years ago, that was a big deal.
[244:28.79]I was doing that.
[244:30.04]I was that guy for a while.
[244:32.54]There was a solid year or two where I made 10 to 15, 20 grandpa machinima videos.
[244:39.88]It was a running series on Machinima.
[244:43.08]And that was on the Machinima main...
[244:44.35]If you got on the Machinima main channel...
[244:46.50]Because they had Machinima Respawn, Machinima Realm, Machinima...
[244:49.86]They were side channels.
[244:50.95]They did well.
[244:52.39]But to get on that Machinima Prime, the Machinima YouTube channel, that's where everybody was watching content at one point.
[245:02.31]So I got a video on the Machinima Prime channel.
[245:05.48]It was the first Grandpa video.
[245:08.53]And I remember it was like, holy shit, this is...
[245:11.02]A lot of people here.
[245:12.65]That video, I think, I mean this is before the complete liquidation of Machinima.
[245:17.68]But if you could go back, that video had like five or six hundred thousand views on it eventually.
[245:23.20]It was like two or three hundred thousand when it first happened.
[245:25.95]And back then, two or three hundred thousand views was a lot.
[245:30.96]It was a lot back then.
[245:35.38]If you were getting 100,000 to 200,000 views a video back in like 2010, 2012, that was a lot.
[245:42.77]It was like a million views nowadays.
[245:45.23]Before the view inflation.
[245:46.58]Oh yeah.
[245:54.03]That still is a lot.
[245:54.99]It absolutely is.
[245:56.86]But by the standard of kind of the way that the internet became...
[246:00.97]YouTube got so much more mainstream, so many more people came in, there were so many more eyeballs nowadays than there were 15 years ago.
[246:11.26]I remember when YouTube was bought by Google.
[246:16.48]That was a big deal.
[246:18.09]YouTube originally was just like, YouTube!
[246:19.80]But there's like three, two or three guys of whatever made the site.
[246:24.54]And then it was 2012, 2011.
[246:27.63]It was right there.
[246:31.12]That was the turn of how way more people started to get more involved.
[246:36.15]and the rise of HD video too, being able to upload a 720p video, 1080p video was, holy shit, this is crazy.
[246:46.44]Okay, I need to make some tickets.
[246:52.08]Yeah, the Google Plus fiasco where they...
[246:54.37]I remember that too.
[246:56.79]Oh my god, what a blunder, what a disaster that was.
[247:02.10]What were they thinking, right?
[247:03.35]What the fuck were they doing?
[247:05.85]Everybody hated it.
[247:07.01]Nobody wanted it.
[247:07.94]And they just kind of pushed it.
[247:09.84]And it was kind of the turning point for people like not wanting to be on Google platforms anymore.
[247:17.19]It was just, man, it was so, why?
[247:18.99]It was so awful.
[247:29.51]10.
[247:31.44]Yay!
[247:31.64]51 again.
[247:40.38]Alright, 5... 7... 12... 3...
[247:46.04]I got 21 again!
[247:47.62]Alright, I got a shitload of tickets now.
[247:51.24]We definitely want the whistle.
[248:03.26]I definitely want this outfit.
[248:06.55]And we want these two.
[248:08.08]So I need 25.
[248:08.50]Okay.
[248:09.07]I need more tickets.
[248:13.23]Give that whistle a try.
[248:15.89]He's good at sniffing out ghosts.
[248:23.10]Okay, yeah, I remember this.
[248:34.70]Treat them well.
[248:36.10]Yeah, Netflix is buying Warner Brothers for $72 billion.
[248:39.40]You know, I'm not the first to make this joke.
[248:40.91]I'm just going to say it because everybody is saying this.
[248:43.54]I'm just going to be a sea of people that are also saying this.
[248:48.37]We're slowly just going to go back to Cable.
[248:52.89]Everything got deconstructed to get put back together constructed to be cable again.
[248:59.23]It's like, you got all these platforms and all these services and then, well, this one's gonna merge with that one.
[249:05.51]so all that content that they own is going to be part of that content package and then that bigger company is going to acquire that one and then they'll have an even larger content pack so hey it
[249:14.56]$50 a month?
[249:16.15]And look what you get.
[249:16.75]You get fucking this channel, and that channel, and that channel, and it's all under one umbrella.
[249:24.14]What is going back to Cable?
[249:28.84]And you know, annoyingly enough...
[249:31.55]When I think about how it is now,
[249:36.78]It kind of reminds me of back...
[249:38.12]Remember when like Showtime, Cinemax, HBO, Cable...
[249:43.83]We just kind of internetized all of that.
[249:48.46]Because it's like, well, Paramount Plus is where you watch that.
[249:51.61]Oh, that's only on Netflix.
[249:53.54]We literally just mirrored it.
[249:55.52]We held a mirror up in front of the television.
[250:05.35]We.
[250:09.34]Well, I mean like the human race.
[250:11.99]I didn't do it, you didn't do it.
[250:13.63]I mean like human beings.
[250:17.70]Do I have enough to do this?
[250:23.07]Alright, let's do this.
[250:25.73]Take the seat, the show will begin momentarily.
[250:30.15]Ladies and gentlemen,
[250:31.39]We take you now to Verdun, France.
[250:33.84]Our hero Edgar has just learned a shocking fact.
[250:36.88]Jerry has sent a troop of deranged clowns into the trenches.
[250:40.65]Can Edgar hold them off until reinforcements arrive?
[250:49.65]Oh!
[250:59.11]He sucks.
[251:02.68]He's only got three kills.
[251:06.92]He's gonna die.
[251:14.38]He actually might lose.
[251:15.63]He sucks!
[251:34.79]He's got seven kills.
[251:46.84]There ain't nobody watching this.
[251:54.61]Say, you're Nightingale, aren't you?
[251:56.57]I've heard you're pretty tough.
[251:58.11]Look, I love this job, but they've got me doing multiple shows a night.
[252:01.82]The audience's brains are so rotted, they forgot that they've already seen the show and queue right up again.
[252:08.42]You want to sub in for a show?
[252:09.72]Here's the deal.
[252:11.45]I'll give you one prize ticket for every clown you kill.
[252:14.94]I'll also give you a bonus of 10 prize tickets if you beat the high score.
[252:19.13]will get you a proper Edgar disguise, those rotting fools won't know the difference.
[252:24.64]Obviously, it's a bit dangerous, but a girl of your talents can handle it, I'm sure.
[252:29.23]Let's do it.
[252:32.53]Okay.
[252:33.25]Good luck.
[252:36.13]Do I have to wait?
[252:37.18]I think I have to use my things.
[252:38.97]Do I have any bullets?
[252:41.76]Ladies and gentlemen, we're taking you now to Verdun, France.
[252:44.04]Our hero, Edgar.
[252:45.06]Okay, clowns are coming in.
[253:00.09]I can heal, right?
[253:03.16]Healing's allowed?
[253:17.32]Fuck you, why is it not reloaded?
[253:34.68]I don't die.
[253:35.37]If I die in the theater, am I dead?
[253:45.62]Alright, I beat his high score.
[253:51.50]Alright, I got it, I got it.
[253:52.70]I got eight.
[253:53.81]He got eight kills, right?
[254:02.70]Did it.
[254:09.02]New high score.
[254:09.77]I've been pressed.
[254:10.55]Here's your prize tickets.
[254:11.35]Let's see, a total of 18.
[254:13.51]If you ever want to do another one, let me know.
[254:15.94]Alright, I got 18 tickets.
[254:22.00]I get to keep the outfit.
[254:27.38]Oh my goodness, that's amazing.
[254:29.89]Is that better than...
[254:31.56]Hold on.
[254:34.99]6% base projectile damage or 10% projectile damage.
[254:42.50]The base one's better, right?
[254:46.66]so
[254:56.92]Do I have enough tickets?
[254:57.74]Yes.
[255:04.00]Where'd you get that outfit?
[255:08.70]The ugly store.
[255:12.79]Okay.
[255:15.80]The base will scale better.
[255:17.34]I think that's... Yeah, because I have more points, right?
[255:22.60]I have points in...
[255:26.43]Okay, I have 21.
[255:27.65]I need 14 more tickets.
[255:40.94]This is a heavy outfit.
[255:44.20]Makes me...
[255:44.58]I mean, I put a lot of points into.
[255:45.98]This is a funny costume, I guess.
[255:56.84]Alright.
[255:57.61]Well, that's like 10% base projectile damage.
[256:05.33]That's crazy.
[256:05.95]18 plus 20.
[256:06.89]Alright, I'm going to upgrade the handgun.
[256:13.26]I need more tickets.
[256:14.30]Do I need more money?
[256:18.30]Okay, if I get really lucky here, then I'll be close.
[256:26.11]Give me 10.
[256:28.73]Five is good.
[256:37.28]I'll take five.
[256:40.88]Okay, I'm out of money though.
[256:50.53]I have to pee.
[257:02.45]But I'm gonna hold it.
[257:04.28]Because I'm probably gonna do this last bit and then end the stream.
[257:10.03]So I don't have to pee that bad.
[257:11.57]We'll hit five hours.
[257:16.98]I don't have to pee that bad.
[257:18.08]It was, I'm good.
[257:19.47]I looked at the clock and I saw, oh, okay.
[257:21.46]Got like 40 minutes.
[257:24.23]So let me get a little bit more money and I'll come right back here.
[257:32.58]It's bad for you to hold it in.
[257:34.33]It's bad to hold it in but not the way that I'm describing it.
[257:38.00]I'm fine.
[257:41.75]That was a I need to pee in 30 plus minutes.
[257:46.15]I can feel it bubbling.
[258:04.70]Okay, I think there's people over here to kill.
[258:15.48]Did I clear everything over here?
[258:18.13]I don't think so.
[258:36.75]That fire is so bright.
[258:46.21]I hear somebody.
[258:53.09]Whoa.
[258:55.53]I thought it was...
[258:56.09]I thought it was projectile.
[259:01.03]Whatever this seed is, I'm getting insane.
[259:06.02]melee damage stuff.
[259:15.23]Is he blocking it?
[259:18.01]You dick.
[259:30.54]Did he block both shotgun shots?
[259:32.38]You gotta be shitting me.
[259:53.26]Never killed one of those before.
[259:56.33]That's money right there.
[260:06.82]get in here.
[260:20.05]Paralysis.
[260:20.70]Freeze.
[260:26.72]Stab.
[260:28.01]Uh-oh.
[260:31.21]Uh-oh.
[260:32.59]Uh-oh.
[260:34.48]Uh-oh!
[260:43.54]Limes told us to wiggle.
[260:45.52]Another raid from Limes.
[260:47.35]Limes, how are you?
[260:51.61]What's going on?
[260:52.97]Limes, thanks for the raid.
[260:59.14]We're still, hey, I've been playing Withering Rooms for a week straight since I last saw you.
[261:09.57]Also, Limes, what was that dog game you were playing?
[261:15.46]I was checking out your stream, and I saw there was a game with a bunch of dogs.
[261:18.93]You were like Street Fighter fighting a bunch of dogs.
[261:27.35]It had like Street Fighter health bars.
[261:29.09]It was crazy.
[261:31.48]It's called My Little Puppy.
[261:35.25]Play it if you want to be emotionally devastated.
[261:38.94]Oh shit.
[261:44.20]But yeah, welcome.
[261:46.37]Thanks for the raid.
[261:47.32]Hope you had a good stream.
[261:49.51]We are still in withering rooms.
[261:54.28]She's not joking.
[261:56.57]We all cried.
[261:58.54]She made us all cry.
[261:59.55]Oh my god.
[262:11.53]Hold on.
[262:13.46]Do I have any bullets?
[262:17.05]I got one shotgun.
[262:19.44]I had to use it.
[262:21.04]I had to.
[262:23.14]I had to do it.
[262:26.55]I had to do it.
[262:27.40]I have to do it.
[262:28.18]I have to run.
[262:29.25]I have to do it.
[262:30.07]I gotta go.
[262:36.91]My puppy.
[262:38.22]I'm going to look at it.
[262:38.95]I'm curious about it.
[262:43.44]Do I have enough bullets in this now?
[262:44.97]Alright, this thing's dead.
[262:46.25]Watch this.
[262:46.83]One, two...
[262:53.43]That's a lot of money.
[262:58.52]Ooh, what's that?
[263:00.65]A grenade?
[263:05.40]I thought that was 75% projectile damage.
[263:07.88]I was about to shit my underwear.
[263:12.55]Go back to the ward game.
[263:14.28]I already beat it in record time.
[263:27.65]I said don't block the Raiders this time.
[263:30.12]That was a complete and total misunderstanding.
[263:32.45]I was a total misunderstanding.
[263:35.36]I was very happy about that last raid.
[263:53.81]Go to the hidden chamber.
[263:56.18]Alright, I'm going to do what this person said.
[263:58.03]I'm going to try this.
[263:58.65]Let's go to the hidden chamber and go into...
[264:00.54]Wait, I know what it does.
[264:10.33]Nobody got banned?
[264:11.53]Yeah, nobody got... No one's getting banned.
[264:16.09]They were very nice.
[264:17.90]No one's getting banned.
[264:19.89]It's a very sweet thing to do to raid me anyways, so appreciate it.
[264:26.55]Okay, so you're saying that if I go back here,
[264:33.47]If I go to that scary place, and I go into one of the... coffins, you're saying that that's what I need to do?
[264:45.16]By the way, if you are lying...
[264:48.94]Gun...
[264:51.86]Thank you.
[265:09.28]I thought he was dead!
[265:10.21]I was like, oh no!
[265:13.92]Take Horace with you.
[265:15.16]Yes.
[265:16.16]Use the dog whistle to return Horace to nowhere at any time.
[265:19.64]We have a friend now.
[265:25.10]Can I not upgrade?
[265:31.11]I wish I could.
[265:34.30]Okay.
[265:40.53]So let's try it.
[265:47.53]So we gotta go to the bog.
[265:50.56]See, look.
[265:51.72]Dog friend.
[265:57.12]Is Otto retired?
[265:58.26]I don't keep track, but he's pretty old for a dog.
[266:01.92]Yeah.
[266:03.97]I've been kind of holding back on talking about this for a while, but that's a great segue for me to talk about it.
[266:10.03]I want to do something for Otto for kind of the end of the year into the new year, probably.
[266:17.15]He's not doing well.
[266:19.90]He...
[266:21.12]I think the last time I talked about him, he...
[266:23.94]He has these really bad sub-fluxated wrists
[266:27.68]that they won't really operate on.
[266:29.72]They kind of can't.
[266:32.03]I don't know if it's a can't scenario, but it's a he's 16 this year coming up.
[266:37.67]And the couple people, the couple of surgery places that we brought them to, well, we brought them to one surgery place, but there was a couple of different doctors in there.
[266:46.98]It's not something that they really recommended.
[266:50.44]So...
[266:54.95]And I think last year I told you guys that he was doing a little worse.
[266:58.06]He was kind of having problems.
[266:59.65]He had a lot of medical issues.
[267:00.93]Now he can't really walk at all.
[267:03.40]um I take you know obviously I he still can like use the bathroom he can still eat
[267:08.62]But it's getting to that point now where he's, it's getting worse and worse and worse every week or two.
[267:14.20]And I was told by a couple of vets that we're getting to that period where
[267:21.47]An ultimate decision is going to have to get made at some point here soon.
[267:26.73]So...
[267:29.64]But he's still happy, he's still fine, he's still...
[267:33.44]doing well.
[267:34.81]He's still happy.
[267:36.66]And I'll show him again.
[267:38.28]That's not the reason why I haven't really shown him.
[267:41.62]Um, you'll see he's still the same dog that he was.
[267:44.87]He just kind of is all screwed up.
[267:50.70]And it's weird because he's been around for so long.
[267:56.59]And I think it's gonna hit pretty hard when it's time for him to go.
[268:01.79]and uh the reason for that is not just that the fact that he's obviously I love this dog he's been around forever but I started my youtube channel
[268:11.90]It was like video eight.
[268:15.93]It was like in my 10th or 12th video.
[268:17.70]It was like really early in the first year of me doing YouTube.
[268:21.58]So he's been around for this entire thing, this entire arc of my life.
[268:26.84]Of doing the YouTube thing, then the Twitch thing, and then maybe even doing more YouTube stuff.
[268:31.89]He's been around for the whole thing since I started it.
[268:38.44]So it's gonna be weird without him.
[268:42.24]And I'm not really thinking about that yet.
[268:44.47]I just know that we've been told
[268:47.28]It... it's coming soon.
[268:49.45]It's happening soon.
[268:51.99]Now, soon could be...
[268:53.49]I don't know, right?
[268:55.92]Soon could be weeks, it could be a month, it could be a couple months.
[268:59.48]I really don't know.
[269:01.07]we're gonna take him to maybe some another get another opinion like is there anything else that we can really truly do to help him make him feel more comfortable
[269:10.87]But I also don't want to just keep him around to keep him around.
[269:13.89]Because if he is, I don't want him in any pain or...
[269:18.54]And he's not, by the way.
[269:20.22]This is not like he's in this, you know, my God, he's suffering over there every day.
[269:23.88]I don't want him to get really there.
[269:25.99]I really don't.
[269:28.68]And I think I'll know.
[269:29.46]I was talking to Holly about this the other day too.
[269:34.42]I will definitely know.
[269:36.11]And for the first time in like, I want to say six months,
[269:41.32]I kind of said to myself like, it's getting there.
[269:45.37]We're almost there.
[269:48.17]So he's still good.
[269:49.35]He's still happy.
[269:50.06]I'm going to show him.
[269:51.72]I'll show him on camera and stuff.
[269:53.63]You guys can get a good look at him.
[269:55.94]He'll say hello.
[269:59.02]But even for this community too, like, I mean, if you've been around for 10, 15 years, I mean, he's just been around.
[270:03.38]He's just been, he's been the dog.
[270:05.89]that you've all known since I started.
[270:08.68]Now, he's not my first pet.
[270:10.92]A long line of dogs and cats in the family and throughout the years.
[270:16.89]But he's really important to me.
[270:18.34]And I know that a lot of people here really like him and love to see him.
[270:25.66]but it is definitely happening soon.
[270:30.01]And again, I don't know if soon is a few months or...
[270:33.76]shorter or longer.
[270:35.31]I was told it's... Let's be very blunt.
[270:41.17]The vet told me.
[270:43.28]He's like, from our point of view, it could be really now if it needed to be.
[270:48.48]Like, we're at that point where it could be now.
[270:52.99]So we'll see.
[271:00.88]It's kind of, yeah, preparing mentally too is one of the things is,
[271:08.51]Yeah, it's been... You mentally prepare for it.
[271:11.65]You tell yourself about it.
[271:13.54]You say, hey man, like every day, just get in the mindset that it's going to happen, that it's going to happen, it's going to happen.
[271:19.70]It's like, man, it just sucks, though.
[271:21.23]Just sucks even to know that one of these days you're not going to be there.
[271:25.08]But.
[271:26.95]It is something that it's not like he was going to be around forever, right?
[271:33.72]And I got a lot of memories with this dog.
[271:35.35]I got a lot of memories with it's been wonderful.
[271:37.84]He's been a great dog.
[271:40.59]So.
[271:42.65]I am just trying to look at it a little more positively.
[271:49.42]And he's been around 16 years is a long time.
[271:53.67]So, but I'm going to get in this.
[271:55.06]Which one did the chatter want me to get into?
[272:03.74]That's almost half your whole life.
[272:04.79]Yeah, oh yeah.
[272:08.48]Get in any one of them.
[272:10.35]I lit this right.
[272:11.01]I know what these do.
[272:24.85]Oh man, that lights him up.
[272:28.21]I thought it just killed you.
[272:32.34]Do I have to light them all?
[272:33.57]Do I have to light them all?
[272:41.05]Ow!
[273:00.56]I lost my doc since Slinky last November.
[273:03.21]He was 16.
[273:03.92]And whenever Otto is ready, Slinky will be there to play with him.
[273:07.15]That's really sweet.
[273:22.33]Uh, I don't have, I can't heal that if it happens again.
[273:40.10]But when you see him again in the next, let's call it the next week or two.
[273:45.19]You're going to be like, oh, there he is.
[273:46.58]Of course, he looks the same.
[273:48.41]He acts the same.
[273:49.29]He's fine.
[273:50.48]It's just...
[273:51.74]his body is starting to break down.
[273:54.78]And that's the worst part.
[274:03.44]Am I gonna have to fight a boss if all these come in?
[274:09.22]If I go in all these, am I gonna... What's the point of me doing all this?
[274:13.06]Will it reveal the puzzle?
[274:16.67]Alright, they're all lit up.
[274:18.81]Did I do it?
[274:19.27]Oh, they have... Ooh, wait a minute.
[274:26.23]One, two...
[274:28.70]Three?
[274:29.22]They have a symbol above it now.
[274:37.24]Alright, hold on.
[274:39.99]one two why would this not be three why is this one three and there's no number over here
[275:10.60]456.
[275:10.82]Yeah, because the code is right here.
[275:20.25]Is it the number of sides?
[275:23.04]So it's four on that one.
[275:24.12]Five on that one.
[275:26.43]Okay, 454.
[275:33.90]Hey!
[275:34.89]What is that?
[275:40.51]Touch the sigil.
[275:42.26]Um, okay.
[275:48.99]Labyrinth Market Street.
[275:56.11]Did I do this in my playthrough?
[275:57.68]I don't think I did.
[276:01.18]That's not friendly, right?
[276:07.62]I think I'm going to do this later because I'm getting close to the end of the stream.
[276:12.36]So this feels like a whole place.
[276:22.25]Car.
[276:25.53]Oh, should I do?
[276:26.21]Wait, no, I think I did this.
[276:27.68]Did I do this?
[276:28.28]I think I did.
[276:39.06]Give me a projectile damage thing.
[276:49.98]Finger Collector, welcome.
[276:51.65]I am Ira the Finger Collector.
[276:54.62]I'm in search of a new friend.
[276:55.99]Perhaps you'll be my friend.
[276:59.49]If we're to be friends, I must tell you my story.
[277:02.33]I used to have lots of friends.
[277:04.25]They all had such long, pretty fingers, smooth and supple.
[277:08.54]I put chloral hydrate in their drinks, and while they were sleeping I clipped off all their fingers.
[277:15.56]They were quite unhappy when they woke up.
[277:17.45]They shrieked and waved their bloody palms at each other.
[277:21.78]I hid away the fingers in a box, but they still figured out I was the finger stealer.
[277:26.95]I kept telling them it's just a dream and tomorrow night they'll have their fingers back.
[277:31.22]Though the fingers returned, the memories also returned the next night.
[277:35.91]My friends couldn't forgive me, so they shackled me here.
[277:38.86]Tell me, knowing my story, will you be my friend?
[277:49.14]Ah, sure, why not.
[277:51.45]Even after that story, you want to be friends?
[277:54.32]That can only mean one thing.
[277:56.28]You two have an interest in fingers.
[277:58.27]Oh, yes, you've collected a few fingers, haven't you?
[278:01.68]Well, if you ever want to talk about fingers, just let me know, friend.
[278:05.66]Since society at large frowns upon my predilection for fingers, I've poured my attention to the next best thing.
[278:14.57]Rings.
[278:15.65]I collect beautiful rings and just imagine fingers wearing them.
[278:20.50]Perhaps you found some rings in the labyrinth?
[278:23.95]They have both blessings and curses.
[278:26.93]I can strengthen the blessing and weaken the curses.
[278:30.16]There's a price for this service.
[278:32.16]I only accept bronze fingers.
[278:35.29]How do you get bronze fingers?
[278:36.58]Well, you trade me things.
[278:38.50]Things like rings you don't want or other things.
[278:42.10]You know what I'm talking about?
[278:47.68]OK, what do you what do you upgrade rings?
[278:50.96]Oh, right.
[278:54.80]I wish I had a projectile damage one of these.
[279:04.82]That makes melee terrible though.
[279:12.79]If I get a ring that can do that though... Have you ever peeled the flesh off a finger?
[279:22.04]God's machinery truly divine.
[279:25.11]Have you ever wondered why we have five fingers?
[279:27.69]Some lucky people are born with an extra finger.
[279:30.32]You ever heard of Charles Darwin and his theories?
[279:33.62]I wonder if our ancestors had more fingers.
[279:36.38]Imagine having eight beautiful fingers per hand.
[279:39.95]Something I think about a lot.
[279:42.18]I'd love to keep talking about fingers, only I'm working on something right now.
[279:45.29]Save more finger talk for another time.
[279:55.58]Okay, well, I don't want to do that.
[280:03.33]This is making me uncomfortable.
[280:05.55]This is making me uncomfortable, dude.
[280:14.62]Alright, well I can come back here.
[280:17.83]It's super demented.
[280:18.81]Okay, cool.
[280:25.62]I thought he was reading that.
[280:26.65]I did read that.
[280:32.02]I feel like the fingers guy isn't a good friend.
[280:33.91]I feel like you're probably right.
[280:49.70]I want to get into the blacket house too.
[280:57.05]Do I have enough money to do this?
[280:59.20]Yep.
[281:02.88]Okay, I need- how many more tickets do I need?
[281:09.47]Nine.
[281:09.77]I need nine tickets.
[281:14.44]I know the exact game I'm gonna play.
[281:22.63]Wish 21?
[281:25.71]Thank you.
[281:34.15]Hmm, this one's good too.
[281:36.74]I should get it with...
[281:37.38]Wait, oh, I need to buy the tickets.
[281:46.55]I should be able to get it with that.
[281:51.21]Alright, 21.
[281:54.31]4.
[281:55.95]Nine.
[281:57.92]Twelve.
[281:59.63]Seventeen.
[282:00.42]Alright, stay.
[282:03.79]Four tickets.
[282:06.77]Again.
[282:08.08]Three.
[282:10.44]Six.
[282:11.79]Thirteen.
[282:13.53]Three.
[282:14.84]One more.
[282:16.02]Alright, 19.
[282:16.72]Done.
[282:19.24]Four tickets.
[282:25.48]12, 15, 18, stop.
[282:34.12]Okay, if I just do this one more time, I'm good.
[282:42.38]Alright, done.
[282:44.89]See you later.
[282:53.29]Alright, then I'm going to take this upgrade kit.
[282:55.70]Give me some health.
[283:00.60]This one's good.
[283:01.37]It's the heal over time.
[283:02.93]Hmm, yeah.
[283:08.88]OK. Now I'm going to upgrade the handgun.
[283:14.24]And then I'll be ready... ...to fight the witch.
[283:24.94]But, maybe I shouldn't fight the witch.
[283:28.99]Because that will put us into the last chapter.
[283:31.50]It's four chapters, right?
[283:33.11]I think there's only four.
[283:38.33]And I kind of want to see that other place.
[283:46.28]Maybe I'll start with that.
[283:58.21]Yeah, upgrade this.
[284:02.69]And maybe I'll, okay, I'll stop here because then we can open with the witch fight.
[284:09.32]And then it probably is...
[284:12.19]I probably will finish the game next stream.
[284:14.38]Because I think we're almost at the end of the arc here.
[284:25.55]This part past the house you haven't explored either?
[284:27.51]There's a boss up on the second floor.
[284:30.97]I think there's three bosses I could do right now if I wanted to.
[284:33.54]I'm in no rush.
[284:35.70]We can check out the side content too.
[284:54.81]Barking?
[284:56.18]What happened?
[285:02.39]Someone said, when's SEGA CD coming back?
[285:05.71]It's still right next to me.
[285:07.84]I think we're going to do that soon.
[285:11.37]That is probably going to be the next thing we do.
[285:16.63]I do want to get to the end of this.
[285:17.78]I don't want this to linger because I do want to finish this, but it's coming.
[285:27.62]Alright, I'm doing... Upgrade this one.
[285:30.94]19 plus 23, what is it now?
[285:37.51]What was it before?
[285:45.94]It's better than it was.
[285:51.87]Didn't you say you were going to play every single SNES game?
[285:55.90]Uh...
[285:58.65]I think there's a bunch that I would like to play.
[286:00.37]Did I say every single one?
[286:14.75]SEGA CD, I said I eventually wanted to play them all.
[286:19.25]There's only like 100 or something.
[286:21.02]There's like 125 SEGA CD games and we've played over the years like 30 of them, 40 of them.
[286:30.41]And I have a shitload.
[286:32.62]So, we can do it.
[286:35.49]I don't know if we can do them all.
[286:37.10]Maybe we'll try 90% of them, maybe.
[286:42.14]but we'll do that soon.
[286:47.05]You also promised to play Disney Infinity 3.0 or show your asshole on stream.
[286:50.90]We're used to you not delivering.
[286:52.85]I did play Disney Infinity 3.0.
[286:55.40]The game just was a piece of shit and couldn't run.
[286:57.53]And I played it for like 19 seconds.
[287:10.49]N64 weekend.
[287:12.89]Probably.
[287:14.96]I want to play.
[287:15.54]I want to do a full playthrough of Mischief Makers.
[287:18.45]That's one of my favorite games.
[287:20.56]Also, I want to do the tier list of everything.
[287:26.13]where I take every game that's ever had an impact on me and I put them on a tier list and I rank them all and see who really truly is the most important.
[287:35.46]and it's gonna be like 70 games.
[287:48.13]But I will see you guys later.
[287:50.73]I'll be live... What's today?
[287:52.54]Sunday.
[287:57.11]Let's go for like a Wednesday.
[287:58.94]I'm feeling like a Wednesday, Thursday.
[288:05.62]I might just show up on Tuesday, though.
[288:08.81]Let's just say midweek.
[288:10.64]Somewhere between Tuesday and Wednesday.
[288:13.03]I'll be live again.
[288:15.74]And then Thursday is the Game Awards.
[288:17.29]Yeah, so I might do a...
[288:20.59]There might be a Wednesday-Thursday scenario.
[288:23.91]where I'll just stream on Wednesday and then I'll probably only just stream the game awards and then probably just leave right because that's isn't that kind of late
[288:35.20]We'll see.
[288:38.26]When is the Game Awards?
[288:39.09]What time does it start, Pacific?
[288:51.16]Starts at about probably 4.30 PM PST.
[288:55.60]Yeah, so it'll probably be two or three hours for that whole thing.
[288:59.40]So...
[289:00.93]See, I think Ster was talking about doing it.
[289:03.27]Getting in a call and just talking about stuff.
[289:06.45]I did bring it up, so we will see.
[289:11.10]But I'll probably see you Wednesday, Tuesday, Wednesday-ish.
[289:15.11]Sus can stay vague for now, and I will see you later.
[289:18.52]Have a great rest of your evening.
[289:20.18]Goodbye.
[289:22.21]Take care.
[289:22.73]And sayonara.
[289:30.99]See you later.
