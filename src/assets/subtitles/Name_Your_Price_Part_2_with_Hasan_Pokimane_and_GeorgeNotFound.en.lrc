[00:54.17]You're going for two.
[00:54.91]You think you're going to be able to win today?
[00:56.43]Yeah, maybe.
[00:57.43]Maybe?
[00:57.77]Alright.
[00:58.21]Find out real soon.
[00:59.29]Yeah, we will have to find out real soon.
[01:01.07]Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Jerma.
[01:02.68]I like that shirt.
[01:03.24]I like that shirt.
[01:04.02]Alright.
[01:09.23]Is this mine?
[01:10.57]Now, ladies and gentlemen, before we begin our show, we actually have an opportunity for our contestants to win some bonus points.
[01:18.88]That's right.
[01:19.34]We have chosen a Twitch streamer by the name of Datun.
[01:22.16]Yes.
[01:24.10]Yes, give it up for him.
[01:25.54]To go compete in a TwitchCon scavenger hunt.
[01:28.41]Here's the things he must complete.
[01:30.55]He must take a photo with a streamer.
[01:32.09]What else should he do, Will?
[01:33.89]He also has to take a photo with a chatter.
[01:37.03]He has to take a photo with someone in cosplay, a photo in the Twitch... I can't read, I'm dyslexic.
[01:44.53]A photo in Twitch merch, a photo at the OTK booth, and a photo with a waifu.
[01:50.92]And there he is right here!
[01:52.78]That's right.
[01:53.76]Give it up for Datun, he's right over here.
[01:56.40]Now, contestants, you must predict how long it'll take him to get through the scavenger hunt.
[02:00.92]The closest to the actual time when he returns will win 20 points.
[02:04.31]Write down your answers right now.
[02:05.53]How long do you think the tune will take?
[02:07.51]What if he doesn't get it done before the show's over?
[02:09.13]I just made that up.
[02:09.83]What's up?
[02:10.27]What if he doesn't get it done before the show's over?
[02:11.83]Then no points are awarded.
[02:12.97]Then nobody gets points?
[02:13.88]That's right.
[02:14.88]Blasphemy.
[02:15.88]I'm changing my answer.
[02:16.62]Alright.
[02:17.22]I put, I don't know if this is, like, ridiculous.
[02:19.72]I put 38 minutes.
[02:20.54]38 minutes.
[02:21.06]What do we think?
[02:22.42]Alright.
[02:24.37]38 minutes Jerma what do you think uh I'm gonna say did not complete did not that's crazy no face alright when I say go ready take a little bit longer than 11 minutes though go to tune give it up for him alright
[02:43.54]Contestants, are you ready to play Name Your Price?
[02:46.18]Alright, Amaranth, how are you doing?
[02:48.02]Where's our first item?
[02:49.88]Oh, we're going to have a really fun first item.
[02:52.32]Oh, yeah?
[02:52.88]Where is it?
[02:53.56]Well, bring it on out.
[02:54.16]It's rideable.
[02:54.78]It's too big for me.
[02:55.96]Alright, bring it on out.
[02:57.04]Come on out.
[02:57.74]Oh, it's a stripper pole.
[03:01.31]Oh, ooh la la.
[03:02.99]How heavy?
[03:03.45]I don't really want to touch it.
[03:06.33]Very good slap test there.
[03:07.55]This is like the end of a trampoline.
[03:09.89]It was used in a strip club.
[03:11.37]It really did not look clean at all.
[03:12.39]Wait, this was used?
[03:13.23]Oh, yeah.
[03:14.43]This isn't a ramp.
[03:15.81]It's got tip sweat all over it.
[03:17.41]Do you have any sanitization device?
[03:19.13]No, we got it as is.
[03:20.96]Jerma?
[03:21.24]I think it's just a big pipe.
[03:23.00]It's $55.
[03:23.12]$55!
[03:23.18]A lot of people like that answer.
[03:28.12]How much?
[03:28.50]I don't really have much experience with it, so I don't know, but I took into account that it was from Vegas, so cheaper shipping.
[03:35.22]I put $48.
[03:35.46]$48.
[03:35.48]Smart, smart.
[03:39.12]Alright, ladies and gentlemen, the closest to the actual price of this item winning 10 points for the first time here in Las Vegas is Jerma!
[03:46.29]Yeah!
[03:48.70]Ten points for Jerma, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:51.34]The actual price that we paid for this was just a measly $65.
[03:54.84]They have it in between the blades of a ceiling fan.
[04:01.78]How does that work?
[04:03.60]200 bucks?
[04:04.86]I don't know.
[04:06.14]Was it on the ceiling fan?
[04:07.78]No.
[04:08.18]Did they spin it?
[04:09.00]It was 200 bucks.
[04:10.08]It got cut down to 65.
[04:11.06]It's crazy because it's literally Jerma's house.
[04:14.10]Yeah.
[04:17.29]He's the one selling it.
[04:18.52]I knew I knew that cheerleader outfit from somewhere.
[04:21.18]I saw the tears.
[04:21.94]Alright, alright, alright.
[04:23.78]Our second item, ladies and gentlemen, coming on out.
[04:27.52]The beautiful Amaranth bringing it to the stage.
[04:31.37]Second item.
[04:32.81]Is a life-sized...
[04:35.25]Marilyn Monroe cutout.
[04:37.49]Alright.
[04:39.33]Oh, my goodness.
[04:41.07]Look at it.
[04:42.40]Alright.
[04:43.64]From the listing, it says it's up for sale.
[04:45.96]It's a vintage life-size Marilyn Monroe in bikini wood cutout standee display.
[04:51.06]She measures 60 inches tall by 20 inches wide.
[04:55.38]She's water damaged at her feet, evidently.
[04:59.21]She's been sitting in a puddle.
[05:01.07]Oh, you want to go look?
[05:02.93]Alright, Jeremiah.
[05:05.54]I'm taller than him.
[05:06.22]Yeah.
[05:06.46]Same height.
[05:12.37]Alright, alright, alright.
[05:13.73]Just had to make sure I was tall.
[05:15.23]Let's start with George.
[05:16.73]How much do you think this Marilyn Monroe is worth?
[05:18.83]Doesn't look too valuable to me.
[05:20.07]Measly $15.
[05:21.31]$15.
[05:21.33]15 bucks.
[05:21.59]That's nothing.
[05:22.99]$15.
[05:23.78]Nothing.
[05:26.22]Jerma, what do you think?
[05:29.70]Well, because you said it was vintage.
[05:31.08]Yes.
[05:31.68]I'm gonna have to say that it's probably a rare item, probably $80 US.
[05:34.70]$80!
[05:34.78]What do we think about that?
[05:37.38]Alright.
[05:39.44]That was a good answer.
[05:40.30]I'm right in between them.
[05:42.32]It's $65.
[05:43.12]$65.
[05:46.33]When they go high, I go low.
[05:48.77]It's not even that low.
[05:52.45]How much?
[05:52.73]That's not low.
[05:54.40]$38.42.
[05:54.80]$38.42.
[05:55.06]$38.42.
[05:59.20]Ladies and gentlemen, I can't believe I'm saying that.
[06:02.09]I can't believe it.
[06:03.33]He's well on his way to winning his second Name Your Price.
[06:06.51]It's Trevor again.
[06:07.45]20 points.
[06:09.91]Totally just got another 10 points, ladies and gentlemen.
[06:13.43]He's racking it up.
[06:14.32]Racking it up.
[06:15.30]You guys really got to catch up.
[06:16.86]You really do.
[06:17.40]He's cheating.
[06:18.38]You really do.
[06:19.42]Alright.
[06:19.70]Who wants a Marilyn Monroe?
[06:21.38]Who lives close?
[06:24.65]Here comes Will Neff into the audience.
[06:26.63]Are you giving it away?
[06:27.59]They're currently shitting their bricks.
[06:29.15]Here comes Will Neff.
[06:30.35]Give it up for Will Neff.
[06:33.55]Here he comes.
[06:35.77]$250.
[06:35.81]That's crazy.
[06:36.43]Alright.
[06:36.99]I paid $250 for this?
[06:37.55]God, we really got ripped off, didn't we?
[06:40.37]Here comes our next item.
[06:42.53]It's being wheeled out of the stage because it's actually way too big.
[06:45.59]Ladies and gentlemen, we have a 55-gallon drum of water-based lube.
[06:49.59]Ooh.
[06:51.35]That's a lot of lube.
[06:52.79]Here we go.
[06:54.48]Here it comes 55 gallons and I want to make it very clear folks of this is real from the listing.
[07:02.70]40 fluid ounces of unscented or out of 5 star rating water-based formula paraben free slick and slippery lube.
[07:13.68]They tell me in the listing it's compatible with most toys.
[07:17.95]It's equivalent to 888-ounce bottles, and the pump is included, folks.
[07:23.51]Who packaged it?
[07:25.57]How do you package that?
[07:26.65]I don't know.
[07:27.31]Very carefully.
[07:29.21]And I'm not even kidding.
[07:30.27]They told us here at TwitchCon, if we spill the lube, the show's over forever.
[07:36.39]So it's actually in here.
[07:37.19]They had to bring it out here.
[07:38.00]I mean...
[07:39.52]it's heavy I can't even open it up they're yelling at me don't do it don't do it alright we're gonna start with Jerma as you are in first place and you're a man who knows his loo oh yeah so we've got that's a bit how many ounces you say uh seven thousand forty fluid ounces seven thousand and forty that's a that's a ten lifetime supply I'm gonna say six hundred and fifty dollars six hundred and fifty dollars
[08:03.63]I'm actually amazed that Austin managed to buy it for this show as like a cover-up for himself just wanting it.
[08:09.60]But I put, I couldn't use that if I tried.
[08:14.56]I used silicone.
[08:17.84]I put $2,000.
[08:18.68]That's a lot.
[08:23.01]You have not been to a Walgreens, George.
[08:25.25]I guesstimated about $5 per bottle since it's kind of bulk.
[08:31.55]So I went with $500-ish.
[08:32.99]$500-ish.
[08:33.39]If you get this correct, I will be so amazed.
[08:37.29]Hassan, come on.
[08:37.93]Hassan Piker.
[08:39.16]He just wrote his answer.
[08:40.26]Just writing his answer.
[08:41.66]Point deduction.
[08:44.02]Point deduction.
[08:45.74]Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:47.78]Getting on the board for the first time in, name your price, Las Vegas, it's George Not Bad!
[08:58.45]Yeah!
[08:59.23]10 points.
[09:00.49]I'm ingenious.
[09:01.23]We paid $1,320 for this.
[09:03.29]Who wants some lube?
[09:04.55]Alright, here we go.
[09:07.16]Here it comes.
[09:08.06]This three-foot shark head comes from, of course, Texas.
[09:11.64]It weighs 33 pounds.
[09:14.78]And it's very impressive.
[09:15.92]Take a look here.
[09:16.72]Oh, my goodness.
[09:18.32]Take a look.
[09:18.86]It barely stays on the board here.
[09:21.31]Look at that, huh?
[09:23.19]How about that?
[09:23.95]Are you impressed?
[09:25.43]What's it made out of?
[09:27.09]It is made out of, like, a plexiglass.
[09:29.51]Can we touch it?
[09:30.37]Yeah.
[09:30.71]Go ahead.
[09:31.61]Go ahead.
[09:32.71]I'm very hands-on today.
[09:34.03]I'm very hands-on.
[09:34.97]Put your head in it.
[09:35.87]Touch it.
[09:36.17]Touch it.
[09:38.69]Okay, be delicate, I want it later.
[09:40.93]Oh, okay, okay.
[09:41.91]Tell me your thoughts.
[09:44.21]Tell me your thoughts.
[09:45.25]Let me check.
[09:45.95]Oh, that's, wow.
[09:47.25]Yeah.
[09:47.57]That's razor sharp.
[09:48.41]It's a real shark.
[09:49.49]That is razor sharp.
[09:50.45]Alright, Jeremy, you're first.
[09:53.49]Let's get a look.
[09:54.91]It's probably upcharged a little because it's an interesting item, but it's not, the material's not quite there for me, but I think it's going to be $575.
[10:02.43]$575, what do you think about that? $575.
[10:07.52]Alright, Hasan.
[10:09.90]I'm just glad to be in the vicinity of the price point that Jerma just put out there.
[10:15.98]$450.
[10:16.00]$450.
[10:16.54]I think we're all on the same track here.
[10:17.86]We're getting similar.
[10:19.78]Honestly, I have $4.86 and $0.10.
[10:22.20]$4.86.
[10:22.30]Poki?
[10:25.00]I am in the four-figure club.
[10:29.58]$1,000.
[10:30.24]$1,000.

[15:27.52]Isn't that funny?
[15:28.10]Hulk Hogan!
[15:29.04]Do you actually not know?

[16:06.60]If you don't have any questions.
[16:07.66]We don't even have questions.
[16:09.02]Do you have questions?

[16:13.74]Just want to make sure you know I'm going to win a million dollars.
[16:16.85]Alright.
[16:18.73]Let's get our guesses.
[16:20.63]We go here?
[16:21.27]Yeah.
[16:21.45]I'm going to say S-Fan.

[16:33.32]S-Band TV.
[16:34.32]Alright, come on out, mystery guests.
[16:36.00]Here they come.
[16:37.14]Unfortunately, you all got it wrong.
[16:38.84]That's safety for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Troy Polamalu.
[16:43.42]Let's bring him out.
[16:44.30]S-Band TV.
[16:48.36]Hey, give it up for S-Fan, everybody.
[16:50.76]Look at him.
[16:52.22]Oh, that's a lot of hands.
[16:56.73]Oh, look at that.
[16:58.21]Oh, yeah, but you grew this yourself, didn't you?
[17:00.71]I grew this last night.
[17:01.85]Oh, hell yeah.
[17:03.25]Let's review the predictions of what the contestants guessed.
[17:07.23]Hasan, how long did you guess?
[17:08.61]11 minutes.
[17:09.87]I said 11 minutes and 33 seconds or something.
[17:12.04]That's right.
[17:12.76]Pokémon guessed 28 minutes.
[17:13.76]I ripped mine up.
[17:18.20]He didn't, he said he wouldn't complete it.
[17:20.35]Oh, did not complete it.
[17:21.29]Jerma's incorrect, ladies and gentlemen.
[17:22.82]Give him an edge.
[17:24.00]Good guess.
[17:24.58]But you can still cheer.
[17:26.95]He did it in eight minutes and 17 seconds.
[17:29.53]Eight minutes.
[17:31.80]What?
[17:32.98]And, okay, I'll be honest.
[17:34.40]He's a paranormal investigator.
[17:36.44]He was ready.
[17:37.38]Yeah.
[17:38.06]It was to spite Jerma.
[17:40.78]Oh.
[17:40.94]Yeah.
[17:41.28]Who said I would not finish.
[17:45.09]I just think it is.
[17:45.81]There's so much traffic.
[17:46.89]Eight minutes, which means, Hasan, you're gaining 20 bonus points.
[17:53.27]to tune.
[17:53.73]Thank you so much.
[17:54.97]Come on out with the next envelope.

[18:41.02]You know what, you can't ask me any questions.
[18:42.20]That could really break either way in a week.
[18:44.34]That's why I asked you.
[18:45.60]You know what, no questions.
[18:48.00]Can I investigate?
[18:49.98]You wanna investigate?
[18:51.25]Yeah, sure, you guys sign an NDA.

[20:00.61]Pokey, what are you looking for when you're inspecting right now?
[20:04.06]Facial features, especially noses and eyebrows.
[20:09.53]But they could be half siblings, so tough tactic.

[28:41.03]$500.
[28:45.18]Wow.
[28:45.52]Not going to lie, I thought, you know, that's a good amount for it.

[28:50.27]I went high last time, so I went low.
[28:53.01]50 bucks.

[29:03.14]$200.
[29:03.36]George, this is your moment.
[29:05.68]George, you can come roaring back right now.
[29:08.42]I could.
[29:08.82]I mean, my thought process was if a tissue was 15.
[29:11.69]Yeah.
[29:12.63]And surely a sock should only be 45.
[29:14.05]So the winner is Hasanapi.
[29:20.85]It's quite possibly the most dreaded.
[29:29.06]Oh, no, because we are about to wheel out.
