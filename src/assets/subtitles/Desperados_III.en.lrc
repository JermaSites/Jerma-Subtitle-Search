[00:00.93]Been a long time coming.
[00:03.05]We've been waiting for this one.
[00:06.34]Desperados 3.
[00:08.14]Launched on Steam.
[00:10.70]And I'm gonna play it the day that it launches.
[00:13.32]I've been talking about this shit for like at least a week or two.
[00:17.76]Man.
[00:20.08]Not like I've ever done that before.
[00:23.01]Talking about Half-Life Alyx for about six months.
[00:27.49]We've been waiting for this one though.
[00:31.58]Except not really at all.
[00:34.58]I played Desperados 2.
[00:36.38]I made a video on Desperados 2 for those of you that do not know.
[00:41.14]It's pretty fun.
[00:42.36]It's pretty crazy.
[00:43.00]They made another one.
[00:46.36]So I'm going to play it.
[00:50.56]Zero viewers.
[00:51.46]No viewers.
[00:52.18]Omega lul.
[00:52.92]Yeah, alright.
[00:53.82]Well, whatever.
[00:59.52]I'm okay with zero viewers, you know why?
[01:01.16]Because that's an infinite number.
[01:04.76]It's a never-ending circle.
[01:07.69]There is an infinite amount of you here.
[01:16.69]Zero is infinity.
[01:19.28]Wait, no, infinity is like eight, right?
[01:21.90]Alright, let's have eight viewers, because that's like the infinity symbol.
[01:35.68]No, zero means no one.
[01:37.14]What does the infinite symbol look like?
[01:40.82]It's like an eight, right?
[01:41.66]The infinity symbol.
[01:47.58]What is it?
[01:48.72]Yeah, it's a side... Okay, it's like a pair of goggles.
[01:55.24]It's an eight.
[01:55.82]That's an eight.
[01:56.60]That's an eight sideways.
[01:57.42]It's an eight lying down.
[01:58.30]That's fine.
[01:58.68]Hey, thank you, GameWatch.
[02:01.41]The 10 community subs.
[02:02.15]Appreciate it.
[02:07.59]Thank you, Gamewatch.
[02:09.27]Ten fucking subs just came in.
[02:11.67]That's a lot of money.
[02:12.45]Thank you.
[02:15.21]You're playing Doritos 3.
[02:16.57]It would be weird if this was Doritos characters.
[02:25.31]Doritos doesn't even have characters.
[02:27.96]They never did that.
[02:28.54]They never tried that.
[02:30.68]All Doritos characters were just way too enthusiastic adults giving their children junk food.
[02:37.87]Or stealing the junk food from their children.
[02:41.15]That's pretty much all they've done.
[02:42.59]The Doritos bag is the character.
[02:53.48]Oh yeah, didn't it like tilt around and it was like, Hey kids, it's me, the wild Doritos!
[02:58.08]It moved around, right?
[03:00.54]They did that.
[03:02.14]The Doritos bag like tilted, it didn't have a mouth, but it talked, right?
[03:05.88]In like one commercial?
[03:11.12]No?
[03:11.63]Really?
[03:15.49]No, it definitely did.
[03:17.67]Somebody said that in chat.
[03:18.47]I distinctly remember it happening.
[03:21.29]Never said anything like that.
[03:22.36]Creep.
[03:22.86]Why are you calling me a creep?
[03:24.14]Because I misplaced a Doritos ad.
[03:27.02]Therefore, I'm a creep.
[03:27.96]Creep.
[03:36.91]What was that Doritos commercial?
[03:38.82]Oh, yeah, it was like a Doritos bag?
[03:41.06]Yeah, Doritos are really tasty.
[03:43.66]You creep.
[03:44.84]Get away from me.
[03:45.40]Don't look at him.
[03:46.46]Go this way, everybody.
[03:53.11]How dare he?
[03:53.69]We only eat Teddy's natural corn chips.
[03:58.23]You fucking disgusting creepy.
[04:04.89]Alright, we have a game to play.
[04:05.67]We're going to play Desperados 3.
[04:06.65]Can we only drink peanut butter oil?
[04:10.90]I can't.
[04:11.66]I was still angry about that.
[04:13.64]Ask pre-stream chat.
[04:16.14]I was still angry about that today.
[04:18.84]I was being told that peanut butter was unhealthy.
[04:22.38]And I gave everybody detention in pre-stream chat.
[04:25.80]Because if you think that peanut butter is an unhealthy snack, then your teachers are fucking aliens and they're giving you an alien learning book.
[04:36.25]It's not, it is not, it's unbelievable to hear that.
[04:39.45]You guys need a nutrition lesson, okay?
[04:42.65]Real peanut butter, not like the shit with like 30 grams of Coca-Cola sugar soda put in it.
[04:49.31]I'm talking about real peanut butter.
[04:52.34]It's no sugar added.
[04:54.30]It's got so many delicious, healthy fats.
[04:57.54]It's got fiber.
[04:58.42]It's got protein.
[04:59.48]You know if you got, like, locked in a basement?
[05:02.27]Like, let's say there's, like, an absolute destruction of the Earth.
[05:05.87]And you're downstairs in somebody's bunker.
[05:08.63]And there's walls of peanut butter.
[05:11.04]You can stay alive until all that peanut butter is gone.
[05:13.56]It's a goddamn complete food.
[05:15.54]It's got your protein.
[05:16.32]It's got your fat.
[05:17.14]It's got your carbohydrates.
[05:18.31]It's got your fiber.
[05:19.01]You could live- Peanut butter's a superfood.
[05:20.37]You could live out it- It's true.
[05:21.87]Thank you.
[05:22.69]I want to VIP that person for an hour.
[05:29.51]For some reason, when I bring up the word peanut butter, people think I'm like eating cotton candy out of the bag before you turn it into cotton candy.
[05:37.29]Like I'm just eating cotton candy sugar.
[05:39.14]That's like what I'm telling people, apparently.
[05:43.50]Holy shit, dude.
[05:44.14]You eat like a whole tub of ice cream?
[05:46.92]No, I like peanut butter.
[05:48.04]That's the same thing.
[05:49.58]I mean, I like cookies and cream Ben and Jerry's like the rest of us, man, but I don't... You eat the whole tub?
[05:57.71]No, I like peanut butter.
[06:02.35]I love peanut butter.
[06:04.59]It's like my favorite thing ever.
[06:05.74]Do a peanut butter stream right now.
[06:11.38]I'll tell you.
[06:12.98]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, listen.
[06:15.54]You go, if you guys have like a Whole Foods around you, it's so simple, it's basic, it's so easy.
[06:20.59]The 365, the just default Whole Foods brand, 365 creamy peanut butter on the shelf.
[06:28.61]Go get it.
[06:29.75]You can always tell because it's the one with the oil on top.
[06:34.71]Get that one.
[06:35.83]Get that one and just eat it a little bit.
[06:38.07]Just put it on a fucking piece of celery.
[06:40.41]Dip your pretzels in it.
[06:42.05]Put it on like a toast.
[06:43.73]Please, trust me on this.
[06:47.05]You have to trust me.
[06:52.11]Not as healthy as... Yeah, we went by too fast.
[06:54.29]I don't even know what you said.
[06:59.52]He's the peanut butter guy.
[07:03.97]Pure peanut oil is not good for you.
[07:08.31]I don't know why you guys get this misconception that I'm telling you to put it in an IV bag and drain peanut oil into your veins.
[07:18.98]Peanut butter is a good snack.
[07:26.30]Alright, let's play.
[07:27.10]I'm gonna... At some point during this stream, remind me.
[07:31.48]I'm gonna go over my food pyramid.
[07:33.70]I'm making a food pyramid for you guys.
[07:35.20]Because I think a lot of you guys might have a little bit of unhealthy, non-nutritional shit in your life.
[07:39.51]I'm not doing hard.
[07:43.59]I'm so glad you can't even pick anything other than normal.
[07:49.30]He's got a nut addiction.
[07:51.66]Nuts are great.
[07:53.00]Sunflower seeds, peanuts, walnuts, almonds.
[07:56.17]If you're not allergic to them, eat them.
[07:59.37]They got so many good things in them.
[08:03.87]Alright.
[08:05.09]I'm not going to do... What is it?
[08:06.11]Beginner?
[08:07.57]Or this one's on fire.
[08:08.55]I don't like this one.
[08:11.04]Wait.
[08:12.52]There's a hard.
[08:14.80]And then there's a super hard.
[08:19.34]Requires perfect planning and execution.
[08:21.38]Enemies have lightning reflexes.
[08:22.88]Characters have almost no health and ammo.
[08:25.40]This is not recommended for a first playthrough, regardless of player skill.
[08:31.06]Recommended for veterans of the real-time tactic genre, not me.
[08:33.56]We're going to stay on normal.
[08:37.14]Thank you.
[08:40.25]I'm not doing super hard.
[08:41.81]I've learned my lesson.
[08:42.99]I can't do that anymore.
[08:44.95]I can't just fucking pick the hardest difficulty for a joke for 10 minutes and then we have to restart the stream.
[08:49.35]I'm not doing that.
[08:50.31]I'm not that guy anymore.
[08:56.17]That's all you guys want.
[08:57.19]You want me to get destroyed for like 30 minutes and then you know I'm going to turn it off and turn it back on again on normal.
[09:02.20]We're skipping that part.
[09:03.68]VOD watchers, you don't have to do anything.
[09:06.12]Stay here.
[09:14.79]It's really low.
[09:15.37]It's just a lot of audio so low.
[09:33.67]He chugged peanut butter.
[09:34.65]Guys, I will eat at least five or six full spoonfuls of peanut butter on stream.
[09:40.01]That's normal to me.
[09:41.98]That's not abnormal.
[09:42.92]That's not like, oh, I will do that and it'll be fine.
[09:46.36]That's like a routine.
[09:49.04]Johnny, you're straggling.
[09:50.72]Come on.
[09:52.54]Right behind you, Pa.
[09:58.40]Eat a whole jar.
[09:59.88]Now that's unhealthy.
[10:01.28]Now that's not good for you.
[10:07.61]I'm going on ahead.
[10:09.35]You follow.
[10:10.17]Keep your head down.
[10:11.27]Does this guy like a top-down Red Dead Redemption 2?
[10:13.66]Yes, sir.
[10:14.22]Which one am I?
[10:16.14]Wait, that's me.
[10:16.78]That's the guy from the second game, right?
[10:19.78]Sly Cooper?
[10:21.44]Going with soap?
[10:21.98]Come on.
[10:27.92]Somebody said it in pre-stream.
[10:29.56]Somebody said Sly Cooper in pre-stream chat and it's stuck in my brain.
[10:33.37]Alright, move.
[10:33.97]I got this.
[10:36.92]Alright, that's pretty responsive.
[10:38.06]Move camera.
[10:38.81]Mouse.
[10:40.59]Right.
[10:41.35]WASD does not move the camera.
[10:43.27]Okay, I can hold middle mouse button just like every RTS.
[10:47.71]Okay.
[10:48.67]Where am I going?
[10:51.44]Drink out of the water?
[10:54.62]Ooh, wait.
[10:55.68]There's a super zoom.
[10:57.02]Can I tilt?
[10:58.88]Ooh.
[11:01.15]Cool.
[11:05.52]I'm gonna get so fucking killed.
[11:07.62]Alright, crouch.
[11:08.64]Gunman.
[11:08.78]Okay, crouch.
[11:09.04]Use.
[11:09.20]Use control.
[11:09.66]Am I using?
[11:10.18]Control.
[11:10.68]Use control.
[11:11.60]Let display view come.
[11:13.74]Display view come?
[11:35.48]They found us!
[11:36.84]Stop!
[11:39.38]What the hell happened?
[11:40.86]Sorry.
[11:42.06]I slipped up.
[11:46.88]Thank God.
[11:48.13]Thank God I'm here with my friend.
[11:50.29]Okay, why does it say use control?
[11:52.31]What is it for what?
[11:53.77]Control.
[11:54.13]I can't use anything.
[11:54.91]Oh, you have to hold it and then grab.
[11:57.19]Okay.
[12:00.58]He came in and threw a knife at the guy's neck.
[12:03.20]If an enemy sees you in their view cone... If the enemy sees you, the view cone fills with yellow, right?
[12:08.20]It's like Metal Gear Solid.
[12:09.62]If the yellow reaches you, the enemy detects you.
[12:11.23]Start attacking and sounding alarms.
[12:12.77]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:13.93]So just like... It's Metal Gear Solid 2.
[12:15.89]There it is.
[12:19.13]There he is, right?
[12:20.43]There's the first guard.
[12:22.31]I need to be sneaky about this.
[12:24.15]Leave it to me.
[12:24.69]Okay, first guard.
[12:26.11]Can I loot this guy?
[12:28.50]Is it time?
[12:30.72]Sure.
[12:31.36]Let's go.
[12:32.76]Alright, let's go crouch.
[12:35.90]On my way.
[12:36.86]Okay, quick save.
[12:38.26]Thank God there's a quick save.
[12:40.50]You can save the game at any time by pressing F5.
[12:42.40]Quick load by pressing F8.
[12:44.00]Okay, I'm going to be using this all the time.
[12:45.43]F5 and F8.
[12:46.25]Hey, thank you Sly Cooper for the 10 subs.
[12:55.05]Thanks for the 10 subs, Sly Cooper.
[12:58.93]use it often failing and retrying is intended and part of the game f5 and f8 okay f5 alright good last save one is that gonna keep that gonna stay there sure sure let's go copper can throw a coin to distract enemies with the blue radius press e then press l and mouse
[13:27.13]We need to get his attention elsewhere.
[13:29.43]Sure.
[13:30.39]I'll throw one of my coins.
[13:31.53]Good idea.
[13:32.07]Get him to turn his head.
[13:33.75]I'll do the rest.
[13:35.31]If eventually this is a brick, then I think a lot of you guys need to pay more attention.
[13:40.38]Need some change?
[13:41.82]You hear that?
[13:42.52]Let's go.
[13:43.26]I'll get it done.
[13:45.68]Wait.
[13:45.96]Hey.
[13:48.26]Why are you so much better than me?
[13:50.00]Think slow.
[13:51.32]Act fast.
[13:52.22]We always hide the body.
[13:53.50]Why do I have to constantly count things up?
[13:57.69]You have to hide the body?
[14:00.87]Alright, now what?
[14:04.21]Catch up to your father.
[14:07.97]Oh, he's my dad.
[14:09.71]Okay.
[14:13.43]Showdown mode.
[14:14.70]Shift.
[14:15.86]This might be fun.
[14:19.48]Incoming dead dad.
[14:21.06]No, stop.
[14:27.57]No!
[14:28.95]They're not gonna do that in this game.
[14:31.45]Showdown mode pauses the game and lets you plan one action per character.
[14:35.11]Okay.
[14:35.91]You can execute actions right away or save them for a later time.
[14:39.38]First shift to enter showdown mode.
[14:42.22]So it's a pause.
[14:43.06]Then you can just go, alright, I wanna do this, I wanna do that, I wanna do that.
[14:45.92]Okay, let's do showdown mode.
[14:47.70]Showdown.
[14:51.60]Throw coin at horse.
[14:54.04]E. One fake coin.
[14:55.42]Leave it to me.
[14:56.02]Coin at horse.
[14:57.80]Continue.
[15:00.33]Execute order.
[15:01.15]One turn.
[15:08.29]Alright.
[15:08.68]Do it again.
[15:09.12]Still got plenty left.
[15:11.44]Nice.
[15:20.21]Why don't you just throw knives at people, dude?
[15:22.91]I don't get it.
[15:24.37]Sure thing.
[15:25.01]Wait, is this person unconscious?
[15:26.81]Hey, Pa?
[15:27.55]Yeah?
[15:28.05]How many men does Frank have?
[15:29.45]Doesn't matter, boy.
[15:30.35]What are you doing?
[15:31.33]One-on-one, you always got a chance.
[15:33.75]You just gotta thin out the pack.
[15:36.29]Okay, save.
[15:39.54]Sure.
[15:40.28]Let's go.
[15:41.10]Knife camera.
[15:43.78]Locked.
[15:44.60]No surprise there.
[15:47.13]Distract the guard, anger the horse.
[15:49.67]Alright, son.
[15:50.99]Time for a challenge.
[15:52.31]See that ladder up there?
[15:54.27]I need you to throw it down for me.
[15:55.69]Okay.
[15:57.77]Mouse, wheel, zoom, and get it.
[15:59.69]Sure.
[16:00.95]No problem.
[16:01.67]Oh, thank God he knows where to go.
[16:02.85]I would have walked around in circles and everyone would have been like, oh my God, he doesn't know what he's pretending.
[16:09.78]I don't even have to pretend.
[16:10.62]He can just play.
[16:13.70]Oh, you'd have to double tap.
[16:14.42]Cool.
[16:15.82]I got this.
[16:16.88]I knock it down.
[16:21.58]Could be an acting screen.
[16:22.80]Good job.
[16:23.90]That's my boy.
[16:24.82]It was easy.
[16:27.16]Somebody's gave $50.
[16:28.04]Alright.
[16:29.04]Tim Times gave 5,000 bits.
[16:32.58]Thanks for the $50.
[16:33.46]And they do the, they say, moi, the French champagne.
[16:37.74]Always been celebrated for its excellence.
[16:40.67]They start with interruptions.
[16:42.15]Stay cool.
[16:42.69]Hey, thank you for the, that's a $50 interruption.
[16:45.75]Thank you.
[16:48.22]While crouched in space, you can safely move through the dark, striped area of enemy's viewkins.
[16:54.79]While scrotched on a roof- I can't even read anymore!
[16:59.09]What's going on?
[17:00.61]I'm only 34!
[17:02.09]What's happening?
[17:03.39]This doesn't- This is fucking stupid!
[17:06.63]Why- I used to be able to read anything!
[17:11.15]Why did I add an S?
[17:14.77]You're always hidden to guards as long as you stay in the darker area.
[17:17.73]Okay.
[17:21.45]Yeah, I know.
[17:21.99]Quick save.
[17:23.91]He's only 34 and he's like, he can't even read anymore.
[17:27.28]Oh yeah, he was squashed.
[17:31.38]Okay.
[17:32.38]View cone.
[17:33.34]Left mouse button.
[17:34.12]See their view cones.
[17:36.17]Alright, we got an area here.
[17:37.21]We got to go this way.
[17:39.81]I'll get it done.
[17:40.55]Ooh, that explains why the old bastard has it in for her.
[17:45.01]It's now or never.
[17:46.19]I got to go down here.
[17:48.39]Wait, can I just walk across?
[17:51.40]It has to turn yellow, right?
[17:52.74]I should go this way.
[17:56.86]I can climb up this?
[17:58.84]Or am I going to go for it?
[18:00.08]Here we go, right?

[20:30.85]How do I tie him up?
[20:31.39]Oh shit, there's a tutorial.
[20:32.53]He left a note for me to tell me how.
[20:35.83]You can hide bodies in bushes.
[20:55.06]Houses and other places.
[20:56.08]Hold control and press left mouse to pick up a body.
[20:59.37]Hold control and press left mouse to drop a body.
[21:02.45]Okay.
[21:03.95]Don't mind me.
[21:08.49]Good job.
[21:09.48]Now hide him in the bushes.

[21:39.63]Rotate camera.
[21:42.39]Hold on.
[21:42.85]Yes, I will.
[21:44.35]That was fucking crazy.

[23:50.26]Nice.
[23:50.46]Alright, nobody up here?
[23:53.30]Okay.
[23:55.34]You can highlight all interactable objects if you press H. Wow, that's really useful.
[24:00.61]Okay, cool.
[24:01.71]Do I have to go over there and drop that on those guys?
[24:04.71]Is this a bird's nest?
[24:06.43]What's in there?
[24:11.92]Oh, okay.
[24:14.64]So, if I drop down here...
[24:19.08]Hitman looks a lot different than I remember.
[24:20.60]It does.
[24:22.68]What's that?
[24:27.96]Oh, that's going in here.
[24:31.56]Okay, I don't want to do that.
[24:36.74]Holy shit, that was kind of brutal.
[24:41.49]Come on up here, Dad.
[24:51.06]Nondescript civilian, 10 subs.
[24:52.34]That's a lot of fucking subs today.
[24:53.79]No problem.
[24:54.59]It's like 40.
[24:56.01]Jesus.
[24:56.43]Good job, boy.
[24:58.49]You know the drill.
[25:00.09]You wait till I'm back.
[25:01.95]Here he comes.
[25:02.97]I thought I was ready this time.
[25:05.63]Next time, I bet.
[25:06.91]I saw the same thing last time.
[25:09.65]Why can't I come with you?
[25:11.59]Just give me a gun.
[25:12.47]A gun, huh?
[25:16.05]By the way, I want to tell you something.
[25:18.11]I got something real important to tell you when I get back.
[25:20.71]I want to see the main part of the story 15 paces.
[25:30.64]This one.
[25:31.32]Oh, you get guns in this game.
[25:36.11]Yeah, na aim.
[25:39.71]Sorry, sorry.
[25:40.09]So much time online.
[25:49.13]When you pull that off, you're ready for a gun.
[25:54.65]See you later, Johnny.
[25:55.51]Do I have to sit here and practice until I get it?
[26:01.30]I'm aiming at it.
[26:02.02]Are we going to get a transition into him having a beard and being, like, presumably 20 years older?
[26:10.94]Because anytime you get a beard, it means you've aged at least 25 years.
[26:21.60]Gonna get it.
[26:22.20]Right when they pull all the way back.
[26:24.82]Oh.
[26:28.48]Oh.
[26:36.84]If only the characters could do a backflip.
[26:41.33]Alright.
[26:49.97]Okay.
[26:50.15]Look at these loading times.
[27:00.72]Oh, yeah, a broadcaster.
[27:08.87]Pick her clean, boys.
[27:10.59]Oh, nice.
[27:11.19]Take everything that shines.
[27:13.19]It's grenades.
[27:13.77]It's probably grenades.
[27:14.31]And everything what could drink a man blind.
[27:17.24]Big Ann?
[27:17.66]It's like a shootout.
[27:20.70]Do I get to actually use a gun?
[27:22.70]Come on, let's show them who's boss.
[27:28.00]Yeah, take cover.
[27:31.14]Crane robbery?
[27:31.86]Holy shit, who's doing that?
[27:37.40]That's insane aim.
[27:38.82]Is this me?
[27:39.16]No, he got his hands out.
[28:01.20]Do people even have weapons?
[28:06.14]Well, this is not good.
[28:09.41]This is a huge train.
[28:16.13]This is the biggest train I've ever seen in my life.
[28:27.23]Rocky Mountains, Colorado.
[28:33.85]You're a city slicker.
[28:35.70]Am I?
[28:36.00]This felt huge.
[28:40.64]The train was so long that I feel like if the train crashed, it would take like four hours before we even figured it out back here.
[28:51.15]There he is!
[28:56.11]Does he have a beard?
[29:03.18]kinda seems like we made an unplanned stop kinda I'd better go find out what's holding us up okay where I have a weapon this game's kind of fun to sneak my way up to I have a knife train holy can you I can stab people alright hold on this game's fun okay then anything else over here wait what about you and up
[29:36.83]On my way.
[29:40.37]Hurry up.
[29:42.88]I'm so glad you could do that.
[29:45.64]Okay, here we go.
[29:46.78]Knife knockout.
[29:47.52]You can take down enemies up close using your knife.
[29:51.08]Or knock them out.
[29:51.84]Press Q to select the knife.
[29:53.24]Then L to attack.
[29:54.66]For a knockout, swap out the skill in the skill bar.
[29:58.13]I mean a knockout.
[30:00.43]Let's make it quick.
[30:01.13]Are you fucking serious?
[30:02.15]Okay.
[30:06.79]No, I'm not knocking him out.
[30:08.21]He's got a gun.
[30:11.15]Can I pick up that gun?
[30:14.90]Nice knockout.
[30:19.16]Why would I knock him out?
[30:21.48]The fucking desperado.
[30:23.18]Throwing knife.
[30:25.88]Koopa can throw his knife to take down enemies from afar.
[30:29.42]He needs to retrieve it afterwards.
[30:31.00]This is awesome.
[30:32.89]Or does W just like throwing knife and throw it with L?
[30:35.79]Gotta take him out from here.
[30:37.79]Better throw a knife.
[30:41.10]Eyes on.
[30:41.92]No need to get bloody.
[30:43.60]I have to get the knife.
[30:46.22]Oh, shit.
[30:47.56]Knock this guy out.
[30:54.82]I'll get close and personal.
[31:02.00]Oh shit.
[31:02.64]That guy had a shovel.
[31:08.06]That guy had a shovel.
[31:08.84]Alright, that guy was the one who was going to give me the shovel.
[31:14.21]Gotta go.
[31:14.59]Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.
[31:16.05]This guy's going to wake up.
[31:17.73]Throw him!
[31:18.15]Throw him!
[31:30.99]Yeah, he's dead.
[31:32.41]Give me the knife.
[31:34.69]You're ignoring that.
[31:36.49]Put a facecam on the portrait.
[31:39.47]No, I don't have a... I'm naked.
[31:40.67]I can't do that.
[31:43.36]Save it.
[31:46.06]No, I'm not gonna put casino ink on the portrait.
[31:50.52]No.
[31:51.60]No.
[31:54.40]Hold on, hold on.
[32:00.13]You said you bought a cowboy costume.
[32:02.55]Do you really think I did that?
[32:04.08]Oh, these civilians, okay.
[32:10.44]Don't hurt them.
[32:11.14]Here, have a coin.
[32:11.90]Did he say, what the fuck?
[32:13.30]Because I gave him a coin?
[32:22.56]Oopigan uses revolvers to take down guards.
[32:25.26]Guns are loud and will alarm guards that hear them.
[32:29.16]Oh, shit.
[32:30.82]Okay, what?
[32:31.12]I have two different kinds of guns?
[32:37.97]Stop doing tricks and shoot him!
[32:42.79]Why would I... I did a trick and he didn't shoot him.
[32:47.03]Do I press the trick button?
[32:51.83]No, I don't have a cowboy costume.
[32:56.41]I made that up.
[32:57.47]Where's he looking?
[32:58.31]Over there.
[32:59.11]He doesn't see over here.
[33:00.69]Let's take out the new model army.
[33:02.55]Remington model.
[33:02.95]Or the old 51.
[33:14.83]Okay, let's see.
[33:18.37]Did I get him?
[33:19.72]Oh shit, he sees me.
[33:21.20]I need more time.
[33:22.52]What do you mean more time?
[33:24.94]How many bullets can this thing hold?
[33:26.08]I just used the other gun.
[33:30.72]Do you have any money?
[33:34.03]I don't want to shoot them.
[33:37.65]How do I put this away?
[33:38.33]Okay, that's good.
[33:44.14]I'm not... Who cares about lifting them up?
[33:45.51]Where'd they go?
[33:48.21]Where'd they go?
[33:51.83]Did they jump off?
[33:57.15]I fell.
[34:05.51]No, I'm going to play this like I play every game that's like Hitman.
[34:09.49]Try to sneak in.
[34:11.57]Get stopped at the front door.
[34:14.15]And then just shoot him off.
[34:15.83]Who is this?
[34:20.81]Maybe throw a grenade or two.
[34:25.75]Should I sneak over here?
[34:26.69]I feel like this is a character I want to keep.
[34:31.91]Dual shot.
[34:32.77]You can fire both guns at the same time.
[34:37.42]You can now choose two targets for Cooper's guns.
[34:40.45]Oh, that's really awesome.
[34:41.23]That's actually really cool.
[34:42.87]Hold on, let's see.
[34:45.25]One, two, execute.
[34:50.41]Nice.
[34:52.95]A two-headed boy, thanks to the five subs.
[34:54.87]You...
[35:07.08]Alright.
[35:09.36]I'd say we're even now.
[35:13.57]Identify this.
[35:15.03]Now, I suggest you return to your wagon.
[35:17.79]I'll handle things from here.
[35:20.77]Well, like you handle those two.
[35:24.09]Listen, Mr. Dad, no Cooper, you would recognize your own dad.
[35:29.36]Mr. Cooper, I've been hired to make sure this train gets to Flagstone.
[35:34.69]I'd appreciate it if you don't get in my way.
[35:37.50]Well, now, Mr. We go like four hours into the game.
[35:41.38]Dr. McCoy.
[35:42.50]And he finally talks about how he's like Mr. Cooper.
[35:45.22]Oh, shit.
[35:47.24]Yeah, Dad, it is you.
[35:48.50]Fuck.
[35:48.82]It's been a while.
[35:50.46]How did I not know?
[35:53.90]Suit yourself.
[35:55.27]But don't say I didn't warn you.
[35:57.09]You don't typically wear purple.
[36:12.01]So, looks like the bandits blocked the tunnel.
[36:15.45]That's a very simple joke.
[36:16.31]Why do you think the train stopped?
[36:18.23]It's going to take some work to clear those rocks.
[36:21.59]Give me your dynamite.
[36:22.33]You're going to give me dynamite?
[36:23.15]Yes, you are.
[36:24.95]Good thing they have a stash of dynamite up on that plateau.
[36:28.41]Yeah, grab it and clear the tunnel.
[36:32.39]Not such a bad plan.
[36:34.39]I don't do bad plans.
[36:36.87]Fair enough.
[36:38.63]Let's get to it, then.
[36:39.61]Alright.
[36:40.43]Sure thing.
[36:44.02]understood why people just put this huge stuff like stuffed peppers worth of dynamite why would you do that why can't you have like five different barrels why is it to be stuffed that much in it I don't know you can throw your bag yeah okay he has to retrieve it again a gas trap blinds enemies who opened the bag
[37:15.43]Oh shit, I have more than one character now.
[37:17.61]What is this one?
[37:19.71]Syringe.
[37:20.64]Well, the game just got way better.
[37:22.30]You can throw the bag.
[37:24.92]First enemy to spot it will come for it.
[37:26.62]If opened, it briefly blinds the target with gas.
[37:29.58]Alright, so we're going to go up here.
[37:33.14]We can go two different ways.
[37:34.16]Alright, you go this way.

[39:42.87]Bunt line.
[39:44.65]Okay.
[39:53.41]If he needs this skill for a mission, he will carry a final golden bullet.
[39:58.79]There's a lookout up on the cliff.

[40:03.38]That I want to see.
[40:04.76]Well, I'll be damned.
[40:07.40]I'm going to give him a chance.

[40:14.39]Hurry up.
[40:15.21]Isn't that a pistol?
[40:17.45]I'll take it.
[40:18.75]Where can I put him?
[40:22.22]On my way.
[40:23.26]Who cares?
[40:23.62]Put him over here.
[40:25.00]This is the tutorial mission.

[40:31.08]I've got a group of three up here.
[40:36.37]It's now or never.
[40:37.49]I can't climb that.
[40:38.83]Shit.
[40:43.71]Can you do anything about this?
[40:44.61]Straight through hell.
[40:46.65]Alright.
[40:46.81]I'll follow.
[40:55.64]Can he shoot that?
[40:58.53]Oh, I thought I had an H on.
[41:00.25]H was activated.
[41:01.13]It was fucking me up.
[41:04.37]He can't climb this?
[41:05.11]Oh, wait.
[41:07.25]He's too old to climb it?
[41:08.45]Save that game.
[41:12.11]You can highlight both characters.
[41:15.21]Oh, that's so much better.
[41:17.21]Okay, cool.
[41:18.67]Alright, nice.
[41:21.68]No, not this way.
[41:24.14]The path is blocked.
[41:25.68]I refuse.
[41:29.34]No, not this way.
[41:30.92]Alright, get out.
[41:33.53]Why do we do that?
[41:41.75]I refuse.
[41:42.87]How are we going to tackle this, man?
[41:48.04]We've got a campfire over here.
[41:49.56]You've guns, right?
[41:52.40]I know I'm supposed to be tactical about this, but is that really going to be a thing?
[41:56.18]I could do the showstopper, and we could both do something.
[41:59.84]I could throw a knife at this guy right now.
[42:01.32]I'm going to throw a knife at this guy right now.
[42:02.52]Okay, he's dead.
[42:03.78]Alright, now go get him.
[42:04.56]Go get him.
[42:04.84]Go get him.
[42:05.14]Go get him.
[42:05.48]Go get him.
[42:05.78]Go get him.
[42:06.10]Go get him.
[42:06.42]Go get him.
[42:06.74]Go get him.
[42:07.90]Quick.
[42:08.56]Okay, that worked.
[42:17.61]Alright, I'll do it again.
[42:19.51]Someone's about to lose a few teeth.
[42:21.77]Got it.
[42:23.88]You're heavy.
[42:24.98]Let's go.
[42:28.06]That work?
[42:28.34]Okay, now what?
[42:34.75]Here goes.
[42:35.93]Where's the site?
[42:37.79]Alright, stay behind the rock.
[42:40.53]Um, okay, so I can coin.
[42:42.23]I'm going to coin them.
[42:44.61]And then the doctor's going to... Okay, I have a question.
[42:48.39]Do I get more points for doing things a good way, or can I just shoot all these people?
[42:58.50]Does it matter?
[43:02.44]Wait, give me that back.
[43:03.08]He's not going to see it.
[43:06.53]Give me that back.
[43:07.03]He's not going to see it.
[43:10.81]just what I had in mind do you see this alright he'll see it if I throw it over here alright so I'm gonna gas him and then syringe him it saved me let's throw out the lure it works very fast here they come no objections here it ain't perfect I love how you can syringe people in this game
[43:38.89]Okay, he's gone too.
[43:40.05]We only have one more person to deal with, and I know exactly how I'm gonna do it.
[43:43.83]Easy.
[43:48.37]Okay, good.
[43:49.75]What's the next tutorial?
[43:53.23]Ponchos.
[43:54.60]Guards wearing ponchos don't get fooled easily.
[43:56.78]They don't leave their posts.
[43:59.48]And distractions are shorter.
[44:02.84]Hmm.
[44:05.24]Oh.
[44:05.52]That doesn't matter.
[44:06.04]Who cares?
[44:06.36]Just kill him.
[44:06.90]Just kill him and then punch this guy in the face and throw him overboard.
[44:27.69]Does that mean he can't die?
[44:31.68]No, he actually can die very easily like every other human.
[44:36.28]Okay, kill him.
[44:37.44]Ooh, that was not good.
[44:38.78]Is he still unconscious?
[44:42.88]Showdown mode advanced.
[44:46.58]Okay.
[44:47.42]Showdown mode pauses the game unless you plan one action per character.
[44:50.57]That's important.
[44:53.00]Press enter to instantly execute all the actions.
[44:55.14]Press shift if you want to execute planned actions later.
[45:00.26]Oh, nice.
[45:00.80]Okay, we can do it together.
[45:03.63]We can do one and two.
[45:04.73]Give me that knife.
[45:05.57]Okay.
[45:07.11]Let's go.
[45:08.57]Back in business.
[45:11.39]Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[45:12.65]This is a guard house.
[45:17.37]Hey.
[45:18.49]Ambush right on schedule.
[45:20.45]This is only temporary.
[45:21.25]I forget what this guy's name is.
[45:23.93]It'll cost you.
[45:24.67]Alright, hide here.
[45:25.83]I'm going to get extra points.
[45:27.73]We're going to kill all these people in here.
[45:28.79]Alright, hide here.
[45:29.69]You hide here.
[45:30.53]Damn, that train's long.
[45:32.21]Alright.
[45:32.91]I'm going to gas him.
[45:34.41]Here we go.
[45:34.93]He didn't walk anyway.
[45:36.37]I got a few tricks.
[45:37.33]Who wants to have a look?
[45:38.91]Come on out.
[45:45.85]Straight through hell.
[45:49.05]Never mind.
[45:49.37]I can handle that, thank you.
[45:50.89]Let's keep going.
[45:53.17]I'm going to do advanced mode.
[45:54.56]Let's see how this works.
[46:03.24]Let's go about this quiet.
[46:05.16]I take one.
[46:06.76]You take the other.
[46:09.27]Alright.
[46:10.15]Showdown.
[46:10.57]Do I have a timer on this?
[46:13.21]I don't.
[46:13.89]Okay, good.
[46:14.57]Alright, I'm gonna stab this person in the back.
[46:18.91]And then you're gonna syringe this person in the neck.
[46:22.39]Go.
[46:23.59]Nice.
[46:24.65]Okay, that was fun.
[46:33.98]That was really fun.
[46:34.74]Okay, cool.
[46:35.86]Now what?
[46:36.32]Oh, shit.
[46:37.88]Poncho.
[46:45.62]Selecting multiple characters, you guys already told me that.
[46:47.92]Wait, side quest?
[46:48.78]Alright, we have a side quest.
[46:51.55]Alright, we're gonna throw a guy in the fire, because I have to.
[46:55.67]Alright, showdown mode, right?
[46:57.01]How do I do this without losing?
[47:08.56]We have moral choices to make.
[47:09.66]Okay, there's a guy right here.
[47:12.99]One, two, three.
[47:13.83]Okay, I'm going to throw... Here we go.
[47:15.17]This is what we're going to do.
[47:17.01]We're going to throw a knife at this guy.
[47:19.77]Syringe this guy.
[47:20.77]Here we go.
[47:23.75]Syringe you.
[47:24.69]Then I'm going to switch over here and throw a knife at you.
[47:28.23]And we're going to go.
[47:29.31]Okay.
[47:37.10]I got you now.
[47:38.50]Alright.
[47:38.92]He got it.
[47:39.24]He's good.
[47:39.58]He's good.
[47:39.88]He's good.
[47:41.42]Alright.
[47:41.76]Now shoot him.
[47:42.42]Alright.
[47:45.98]You're all safe.
[47:46.60]Wait.
[47:47.30]There's one more.
[47:48.78]There's one more.
[47:49.28]There's one more.
[47:50.02]I don't know.
[47:51.20]Somebody punch him.
[47:53.38]I didn't see that last guy.
[47:56.66]Alright.
[47:58.60]That didn't work.
[47:59.20]I waste time.
[48:00.52]Let's keep going.
[48:01.65]Golly, I hate fancy folk like you.
[48:04.85]Stop collisioning each other.
[48:06.09]Alright, there's one, two... This is the guy.
[48:08.96]I thought he... Okay, they're all like kneeling down.
[48:10.88]I thought he was one of them.
[48:14.04]Alright.
[48:14.60]Cooper.
[48:15.88]This way.
[48:17.02]I didn't hear.
[48:17.36]Dylan.

[48:19.72]Over here.
[48:23.67]Got a spot right here.
[48:25.09]Go.
[48:30.09]Shoot two people in showdown.
[48:32.08]Oh, yeah.
[48:34.16]Okay.
[48:34.88]Bag?
[48:35.28]I think I can just kill this guy without anybody knowing.
[48:40.30]No.
[48:40.84]Yeah, maybe I can.
[48:41.60]Okay, if I just get over there.
[48:44.20]Save it right here.
[48:45.72]If I just get over here, because he can't see.
[48:47.34]Alright, he's in a good spot.
[48:49.00]Um.
[48:49.12]Okay.
[48:49.94]New plan.

[49:37.16]Now I'm going to stab this.
[49:38.32]Especially you.
[49:39.14]I'm going to bag this guy.
[49:40.40]Should I bag this guy or... Okay, here we go.
[49:43.90]You need to walk anyway.
[49:46.91]Primed and ready.

[52:35.28]Well, that was a waste of time.
[52:37.70]See, I knew you had a heart in there somewhere.
[52:40.42]Anatomically, maybe.
[52:42.91]Someone call for a doctor?
[52:46.18]How far away is the load?

[53:11.34]Understood.
[53:11.88]I can't wait till I get grenades.
[53:13.02]Seriously.
[53:14.06]Run on the train.
[53:15.30]Looks like we made it.
[53:16.54]We still need the dynamite to clear the tunnel.
[53:19.84]That's easy.
[53:21.40]Come on, let's make our way up.
[53:24.04]On my way.
[53:26.76]Alright, get out of here.
[53:27.49]Go.
[53:27.93]Run.
[53:30.07]Keep your heads down and stay out of my way.
[53:32.88]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[53:37.85]I didn't... Fuck.
[53:49.91]This game's fun.
[53:51.51]I actually like this.
[53:52.40]This is actually fun.
[53:53.22]This is like a strategy game, but for fucking moron psychos like me.
[53:58.63]Like, hey, do you like, like, strategy games with top-down?
[54:01.41]Like, kind of real-time?
[54:03.29]Yes.
[54:04.21]Are you also a fucking psycho?
[54:05.77]Yeah.
[54:06.99]Oh, you're gonna love this.
[54:09.11]Cool, thanks.
[54:10.15]I've always wanted to be this psycho RTS guy.
[54:12.83]Where are you going?
[54:14.30]Where are you going?
[54:15.18]Where are you going?
[54:26.82]Get down.
[54:27.18]I'm trying to read this.
[54:30.00]The view cone marker shows if a spot is watched by guards.
[54:33.32]Hold... What?
[54:37.94]Hold L to place it in a location or a guard.
[54:40.02]What are you guys doing?
[54:48.40]You guys are so stupid.
[54:52.01]I'm trying to figure out the tutorial.
[55:02.73]You know what?
[55:03.03]I gotta stop clicking everywhere.
[55:04.87]I'm playing this like I'm playing League.
[55:06.85]Or, like, Dota.
[55:09.05]Don't click that often.
[55:10.10]Why am I, like... Blast it!
[55:11.42]Like, slow the fuck down.
[55:26.05]You click more often than you click in Diablo II in MOBAs.
[55:29.77]Alright, I have to get this treasure.
[55:32.23]I'm not going to... Okay, so what was that?
[55:33.42]It was hold L. If I can see where they're looking?
[55:39.82]Or how does that work?
[55:40.60]Let's see.
[55:46.12]It's kind of like a location of what they're looking at or something.
[55:52.08]See if an area is being watched or not.
[55:57.38]Oh, okay.
[56:00.15]Okay.
[56:05.93]Leave it on this guy.
[56:08.37]Okay.
[56:10.61]Can I kill this guy and get this stuff without anybody seeing me do it?
[56:14.62]In this bush.
[56:16.32]No, motherfucker.
[56:17.62]I swear to God.
[56:18.32]It's okay.
[56:18.64]Stay right here.
[56:20.80]If they try anything, shoot them all.
[56:33.32]Izo, let's make it quick.
[56:37.51]Alright, get him.
[56:39.03]Pick him up.
[56:39.37]Good, you can pick him up immediately.
[56:41.75]We'll take care of the bandits.
[56:43.39]Thank you.
[56:44.31]Thank you so much.
[56:45.23]Alright, hold on.
[56:46.87]Is he going to notice that this guy's gone?
[56:53.91]Doesn't he not know what the people would do?
[57:00.69]And put him in the box?
[57:04.77]I guess times are changing.
[57:12.55]I can't put him down here, can I?
[57:13.51]Alright, hold on.
[57:15.73]Here comes another guy with a shovel.
[57:21.53]No, I want you.
[57:23.57]I want your eyes.
[57:24.23]Where are your eyes?
[57:24.73]Here we go.
[57:27.16]Alright.
[57:27.70]There's three of what in here?
[57:30.72]Alright.
[57:31.96]I can reload this?
[57:34.08]Alright.
[57:37.74]See?
[57:40.28]It's a reload.
[57:41.14]Nice.
[57:42.40]Nice.
[57:42.72]Okay.
[57:43.22]I'm sick.
[57:44.98]Alright.
[57:45.32]Get the dynamite.
[57:46.80]Why would you stand in the way?
[58:11.00]There's a sniper!
[58:12.29]Oh man, there's a sniper!
[58:13.55]Quick!
[58:14.07]Hey, stick your neck out as far as it can go, Terry!
[58:16.65]Holy shit!
[58:17.09]What?
[58:17.23]That sucks!
[58:32.92]Whoever finds them gets their stuff.
[58:35.58]Okay.
[58:36.60]Not like a thousand gold or something.
[58:39.24]Just gets their stuff.
[58:40.52]Okay.
[58:40.78]Let's go reload that again.
[58:41.78]Hope I don't need this.
[59:05.21]Okay, so we're gonna distract.
[59:06.35]Oh no.
[59:11.41]Okay, they're gonna go in here, not out here.
[59:16.29]Yes, they're all going back into the train.
[59:21.15]We're fine.
[59:22.51]Oh, what about this guy?
[59:24.29]Can't get him.
[59:28.29]That's an obstruction.
[59:29.77]I'm sorry.
[59:31.64]Sorry, you two.
[59:32.16]I can't do anything about it.
[59:32.92]I have to make choices.
[59:36.44]I got a feeling about this.
[59:39.68]I'm going to throw a coin right here and we're going to go doing a showdown these two.
[59:44.51]Let's see what's happening here.
[59:45.81]Not yet, though.
[59:51.77]Don't worry.
[59:52.93]I've seen it before.
[59:54.55]Oh, God damn it.
[59:55.26]Really?
[59:59.04]Okay, coin.
[60:01.68]See if we can grab all three of these guys.
[60:04.82]Distract three bandits at the same time.
[60:14.18]I got lots of these.
[60:16.16]Need some change.
[60:19.97]They're not going to look over here.
[60:20.93]Go.
[60:24.03]That big rock there is looking like it wants to fall.
[60:27.25]Wait I can- there's a big- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[60:32.25]A big rock?
[60:34.25]There was like 10 people right here.
[60:36.25]Oh no. Okay, let's just- let's get him.
[60:39.99]Who's gonna do it? Somebody has to push it.
[60:40.50]Push the rock. Push the rock! Push the rock. Push the rock. Excuse me you gotta push the rock.
[60:57.48]I thought it was going to roll at least a little bit.
[61:01.38]Can I get on a horse?
[61:02.14]Okay, there's one guy here.
[61:11.51]Alright, we're going to distract this guy and then you're going to... Oh, together, together, together, together at once.
[61:17.33]On the horse?
[61:18.75]Can we get on the horse?
[61:27.36]Now's the time.
[61:28.32]Get on the horse.
[61:31.24]Well, now.
[61:32.48]Let's see.
[61:33.62]I wouldn't worry just yet.
[61:34.98]Oh, shit.
[61:35.37]Oh, shit.
[61:35.67]Showdown mode.
[61:36.21]We have to just kill this guy.
[61:37.99]Double team him or something.
[61:39.19]Here, throw the gas at him.
[61:40.43]Execute.
[61:41.41]It's just fishing.
[61:43.27]Here they come.
[61:46.39]I'm warming up.
[61:49.16]It works very fast.
[61:53.52]See you in hell.
[61:56.73]What do I do with these?
[61:59.45]What do I do with these?
[62:00.39]I don't think I can do anything with those guys.
[62:05.12]Oh, shit.
[62:05.58]Save it.
[62:11.28]I can't see shit.
[62:12.66]We're almost at the dynamite.
[62:13.44]I'm almost at it.
[62:16.14]Somebody's about to lose a lot of money betting that I wasn't going to get past the first mission of the game.
[62:22.42]What are you doing?
[62:27.42]What are you doing?
[62:29.02]You're about to... Trying to touch the tutorial.
[62:37.59]Pick up dynamite from the barrel and throw it.
[62:41.77]Come on.
[62:42.71]Yes.
[62:43.25]Okay.
[62:43.53]The game just increased in value.
[62:47.05]Aim with Q and throw using left mouse.
[62:49.53]Be careful.
[62:49.97]It will explode in your hand.
[62:51.27]Oh, no.
[62:52.63]Only one of us is going to do this.
[62:55.59]Pick up the dynamite, not the guy on the ground.
[63:04.71]That's a very, very short fuse.
[63:06.25]That's a really short fuse.
[63:22.51]Why are there so many people just dead up here?
[63:24.55]Alright, who needs this?
[63:25.71]I object.
[63:29.37]Back in business.
[63:31.51]You better have a plan here.
[63:34.07]What if I fuse?
[63:35.58]Better throw it fast.
[63:37.58]Wait, it's already lit.
[63:40.06]Better take cover.
[63:45.12]What the hell?
[63:47.08]Take him, you goddamned
[63:51.90]Alright, we're good.
[63:55.21]We're good.
[63:55.67]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[63:56.95]I need showdown time.
[63:59.81]Roach!
[64:00.37]Alright, I'm gonna move him out of the way.
[64:11.80]We have these.
[64:14.12]Let's take these guys out first.
[64:15.54]I'm not fucking around anymore.
[64:16.60]Let's go.
[64:18.42]These guys all gotta die.
[64:21.84]What are you looking at?
[64:30.13]Us.
[64:30.29]Alright, get the bag out.
[64:31.67]Hide in the bush.
[64:35.77]And then we're gonna go... This guy's dead, okay?
[64:38.47]Throw it out there now.
[64:40.52]What the fuck was that?
[64:41.72]What was that?
[64:43.22]I was trying to throw the briefcase.
[64:44.26]Keep it cool.

[65:30.50]Safe.
[65:30.94]Only one at a time, though, please.
[65:32.98]You stay in the bush.
[65:35.10]Okay, I'm going to throw... We're going to throw a coin right here.
[65:38.54]Good.
[65:38.66]Okay, he's dead.
[65:40.28]Anybody else?
[65:48.56]We're good.
[65:49.10]Alright.
[65:52.40]Let's go.
[65:54.82]Now, only one of you go down here to the dynamite, except you need this shit.
[65:58.02]Here, come here.
[66:00.86]You go up here and hide in a bush.
[66:04.49]You come down here, and you refill your ammo, and then get the dynamite.
[66:08.77]Okay, I'm ready.
[66:12.19]I'm gonna throw this.
[66:13.87]Oh, but there's a guy I could, like, punch.
[66:22.52]It's now or never.
[66:24.40]I've lit the fuse.
[66:28.60]Alright, now run.
[66:29.48]Hide in the bush.
[66:31.22]What the hell?
[66:33.15]Take him, you goddamn good-for-nothing scumbags.
[66:37.63]Good thing we got more dynamite.
[66:40.83]Hey, now.
[66:44.11]We're good, right?
[66:45.85]He's in a bush!
[66:50.10]He's in a bush!
[66:51.88]Why do they know what bush he's in?
[66:56.12]Why?
[66:56.56]Ugh, fuck you.
[67:02.32]Okay.
[67:04.44]I've lit the fuse.
[67:06.32]Better throw it fast.
[67:13.29]Wait, wait, wait.
[67:14.33]Oh my goodness.
[67:15.11]Did you see that?
[67:15.95]Holy shit.
[67:17.31]I killed everybody.
[67:18.09]I killed everybody.
[67:19.17]I killed everybody.
[67:19.83]I'm freaking out.
[67:20.31]Save.
[67:20.62]Alright, now what?
[67:21.06]Play the tunnel.
[67:21.68]Meet up at the meeting spot.
[67:23.80]Oh, I can save these people.
[67:47.42]Why are you both going different ways?
[67:54.96]Just what I had in mind.
[67:56.90]Don't get in the way.
[67:57.78]This guy has a shovel.
[67:58.54]He's not even a threat.
[68:00.25]This is the guy that's the threat.
[68:06.21]My thoughts exactly.
[68:07.99]Bring it on.
[68:09.61]Here goes.
[68:10.65]Hit it and then save the civilians.
[68:13.42]I'll take that.
[68:14.44]Let's make it quick.
[68:17.78]Alright, you're free.
[68:19.56]Nice.
[68:19.70]Ooh, I did it.
[68:20.22]That's a secondary objective.
[68:21.30]Meeting point.
[68:22.14]Let's go.
[68:22.36]Here it is.
[68:22.82]What is this game?
[68:23.60]This is Desperados 3.
[68:24.33]So far, this is actually pretty fun.
[68:47.53]Guess you made the David company happy today.
[68:49.75]How much do you get for a job like this?
[68:53.43]Hope you're not expecting a cut.
[68:56.71]Relax.
[68:58.15]I got what I need.
[69:00.25]This counts as a plus full letter grade, by the way.
[69:02.65]If I can drive the car, which is a horse.
[69:04.47]Gotta make good on time.
[69:07.04]Like I said.
[69:07.84]Please.
[69:10.18]I got an appointment I'd like to keep.
[69:13.70]Suit yourself.
[69:18.00]I mean, if I can full sprint the horse into bad guys, I have to give it a full letter.
[69:22.63]Wait, we're losing him?
[69:23.73]That guy was so useful.
[69:24.63]Matthew McConaughey and Owen Wilson team up.
[69:47.52]Oh, I didn't get this one.
[69:50.64]Don't save during the mission.
[69:52.00]Don't use firearms.
[69:53.14]Complete the mission in under five minutes.
[69:54.84]Complete the mission on hard.
[69:57.42]Well, I got two out of three.
[70:01.02]This always is the most obnoxious thing, and I hate seeing this in every iPad game.
[70:05.78]Two stars is like, holy shit, dude.
[70:07.69]Come on, you were so close to the three.
[70:10.85]One star means you don't care, and you don't have any fucking in-game currency shit.
[70:15.27]Two is you probably bought in-game currency shit, but you used it so poorly that you still couldn't get to three stars.
[70:24.69]That pisses me off, seeing that.
[70:29.25]Wait a minute.
[70:31.67]Hold on, what?
[70:32.27]You can... Wait, this tells you everything you did?
[70:40.42]This is awesome!
[70:42.56]Alright, where do we go from here?
[70:52.71]Why are there so many explosions?
[71:01.76]You're gonna see when I compulsively had to throw somebody off the cliff.
[71:08.02]Does this take into account all the- oh, it says saves.
[71:11.52]Save one.
[71:17.60]Save number three.
[71:28.51]Wait, what happened up there?
[71:30.03]What happened- what exploded?
[71:36.82]I feel like I'm playing, like, Agar.io.
[71:52.41]Holy shit, that was awesome.
[71:56.27]Nice.
[71:57.03]Let's see.
[72:00.79]That's so cool.
[72:04.03]Eight saves.
[72:04.77]22, what's that?
[72:05.40]22 what?
[72:10.15]Why is he on fire?
[72:10.89]Does that mean he did better?
[72:12.23]Oh, he was the better teammate.
[72:14.85]Okay.
[72:15.09]I'm not saving the replay.
[72:19.75]22 saves, 8 loads.
[72:21.27]Oh.
[72:23.03]That's cool.
[72:23.53]33 minutes.
[72:27.93]7 shots, 3 dynamites, 10 stabs.
[72:30.47]Kills, 30.
[72:33.69]Alarm, enemies killed.
[72:34.99]Oh, there's only 2 people left on the whole map alive.
[72:37.07]Isn't that kind of bad?
[72:44.90]The star is five minutes.
[72:46.30]Yeah, no way.
[72:47.40]Alright, we got Devil's Canyon, Diaz Pass, and then Flagstone.
[72:59.76]Do you feel the game is too hard?
[73:03.27]No, I don't want to adjust it.
[73:05.23]John Cooper has come to Flagstone to meet an old friend.
[73:07.59]Doesn't take long for trouble to arrive.
[73:13.23]I just beat the first level in 33 minutes.
[73:14.85]Do you think I'm having not that much trouble?
[73:19.24]Troublemakers in Flagstone Nestles between the peaks of the Colorado Rockies lies the small town of Flagstone.
[73:25.97]Store owners, farmers, blacksmiths, and barkeeps all go about their daily business.
[73:30.39]Workers of the David Company mingle with the locals as they continue to build the new railroad through town.
[73:35.81]As Cooper arrives in Flagstone, he heads straight for the saloon, which is empty except for a few regulars.
[73:42.03]The barmaid pours him a glass of whiskey and the nurse, he nurses it while he waits for an old friend.
[73:46.83]I can't fucking read anymore!
[73:55.19]They tore down old William's house the other day.
[73:58.11]Call Sheriff Luigi.
[73:59.09]Now I don't have to do that.
[74:00.55]Can't they lay their tracks between our homes?
[74:03.24]Actually bad.
[74:03.96]Oh, stick to the game, will you?
[74:06.40]I'm just saying.
[74:07.38]If they ever come to my house, I'll show these railroad thugs who's balls.
[74:12.16]Oh, shit.
[74:13.16]Well, what can I do for you, gentlemen?
[74:15.15]Oh, we'll get to you in a minute.
[74:17.71]You know the drill.
[74:19.07]Everybody out.
[74:21.28]Y-yes sir.
[74:21.84]Look at this game of cards.
[74:22.66]It always looks like this.
[74:23.50]I don't even keep fucking track of who's who.
[74:26.06]You need a better dealer man.
[74:29.34]You gotta get a better banker in Monopoly.
[74:31.12]What?
[74:31.80]Look at me.
[74:41.09]We don't like troublemakers around here.
[74:45.86]Who do we have here?
[74:48.64]well you got double trouble now what the hell you again is the doctor wait he's on my team they're running away like dogs I can't blame them poor guys had to look at your ugly mug oh you're welcome you need a drink is it like a giant sword a bow and arrow hector yours is on the house
[75:18.87]Gracias, senorita.
[75:20.45]It's a big axle for a car.
[75:23.23]You really shouldn't.
[75:24.55]They'll kill you next time.
[75:27.22]They can try.
[75:28.00]I guess you've been here a while.
[75:30.88]Spent your time pissing off the wrong people, huh?
[75:33.26]I'm the one they pissed off.
[75:35.28]But as you're here, maybe we can work together.
[75:38.00]Did he shoot that guy?
[75:40.39]He shot that guy.
[75:41.37]Surround the place.
[75:43.27]Don't let them get away.
[75:45.03]Amigo, you're already in it.
[75:46.55]And besides, you owe me one.
[75:49.23]Alright, let's get out of here.
[75:51.51]Come on, out the back.
[75:52.67]The guy's dabbing.
[75:53.71]Of course he would say that.
[75:54.73]That's okay.
[75:56.15]I mean, of course that's what's happening.
[76:04.96]It's a blood-borne weapon.
[76:06.86]That's so funny.
[76:07.76]Alright, let's go.
[76:09.40]What's his special power?
[76:12.56]They're here somewhere.
[76:14.84]And we got all the time in the world.
[76:17.78]Well, these guys are out for blood.
[76:19.16]What the hell are they?
[76:22.28]Part of the David Company.
[76:24.54]I have scores to settle with a few of them.
[76:27.96]Gover, if I find any green teeth, I need it.
[76:31.78]I'm trying to turn this into a poison weapon.
[76:34.02]Sure.
[76:34.84]Let's head for the street.
[76:36.48]Nobody will bother us if we stay among the townsfolk, so we got room to breathe.
[76:41.19]So far, so good.
[76:42.75]But whose heads are we bashing in?
[76:48.48]Won't that just kill him?
[76:49.60]That's just gonna kill him anyways.
[76:51.72]Oh, this is awesome.
[76:52.90]This is gonna be so awesome.
[76:54.20]I can't wait.
[77:21.71]At last, he's the foreman.
[77:23.45]How many people do I have to kill?
[77:25.45]He's a real asshole.
[77:27.81]Had his men tear down half the town so that he doesn't have to plan around it.
[77:32.66]So we get rid of them, head back to the saloon, and finish our drinks.
[77:37.80]That ain't much of a plan, Hector.
[77:39.62]Why do you think I've waited for you?
[77:41.16]Alright, let's get it over with.
[77:43.48]Do I have to sneak around?
[77:44.44]Am I allowed to be in this town?
[77:46.38]What's the matter with these guys?
[77:53.17]I don't have to sneak, right?
[77:54.13]I just live here.
[77:54.80]Hector can whistle to lure guards towards his current location.
[78:00.80]It's a trap.
[78:03.42]He can place Bianca, a giant but surprisingly stealthy bear trap.
[78:08.21]Hector is smart, so Hector likes to combine his skills.
[78:14.77]That seems...
[78:17.29]Really, really morbid, just unnecessary and completely inappropriate.
[78:22.09]Why don't you just learn how to fucking shoot a gun?
[78:25.17]I see it's time to use Bianca.
[78:27.07]You still carrying that thing around?
[78:28.65]I have a reputation to keep.
[78:31.33]Time to use Bianca.
[78:33.83]Tell him get thirsty Murdock.
[78:35.79]Alright, let's lure someone into your embrace.
[78:39.21]Get your shit together.
[78:43.96]Hector, don't work.
[78:48.84]Can we get this over with?
[78:50.90]We're not done yet, amigo.
[78:52.52]I'll use my singing voice.
[78:53.82]Alright, do it.
[78:55.74]You got it, amigo.
[78:56.92]Sing.
[78:58.06]Sing.
[78:58.94]Who's there?
[79:03.35]Is he even gonna step in it?
[79:06.59]Don't think you can hide.
[79:08.69]Who needs a haircut?
[79:10.29]Yeah, I got it.
[79:13.62]You better leave Blackstone before I find you.
[79:17.02]Bitch, I got you.
[79:20.32]Cooper, the trap didn't work.
[79:23.57]Trust me, it doesn't usually go like this.
[79:25.25]Wait, isn't that the main bad guy?
[79:27.97]Oh, come on.
[79:28.55]What?
[79:28.67]That's the main bad guy.
[79:29.77]What?
[79:48.83]We gotta smoke him out!
[79:51.05]Let's make it quick.
[79:53.05]Now we need to get bloody.
[79:55.36]Good for you.
[79:57.38]I knew I was right to bring you along.
[79:59.40]Sure glad I'm meeting your expectations.
[80:01.22]We got troublemakers here!
[80:02.62]Keep your eyes peeled.
[80:03.48]I need this back.
[80:04.84]Where are they?
[80:06.56]Keep looking.
[80:07.88]Gotta find them.
[80:08.92]Fucking three-head, what?
[80:12.22]Whoever finds them gets their stuff.
[80:15.96]It's so lame.
[80:17.02]What about tea?
[80:18.32]What's tea do?
[80:20.28]Good stuff.
[80:20.82]Oh, it can heal Hector.
[80:23.43]I'm in the mood for some chopping.
[80:25.37]Yeah, that's right.
[80:28.15]You run home to mama.
[80:29.29]You got this, right?
[80:32.21]Look at his back.
[80:33.15]Fuck!
[80:33.27]Fuck!
[80:40.90]Why does this keep happening?
[80:42.16]Why does he stink?
[80:42.96]Drink, drink, drink, drink.
[80:44.02]Whoa.
[80:44.76]What?
[81:11.15]Estus chugging.
[81:12.18]I can't even say it.
[81:14.33]It's so stupid.
[81:24.67]We already know what happens here.
[81:25.89]What's wrong with my voice?
[81:26.87]Okay, this is what I'm talking about.
[81:27.99]Nobody move, nobody talk, nobody say anything.
[81:30.33]This is permanently... I've turned into Tom Hanks.
[81:33.67]Somehow, I just turned into Tom Hanks because my voice has changed a little because I was drinking water.
[81:38.93]Let me tell you, I loved working on Toy Story.
[81:41.83]It was one of my favorite movies working on, favorite films.
[81:44.67]I love being Woody.
[81:45.89]He's the best character I've ever done work with.
[81:48.47]And I'll tell you, Tim Allen with Buzzkill, he was great.
[81:54.00]He was... He was great.
[81:56.38]He was great.
[81:58.12]It's gone.
[82:00.66]It's hard.
[82:02.92]I'll never get that again.
[82:09.04]Hide in here.
[82:15.44]It was never really here to begin with.
[82:16.84]Alright.
[82:17.12]Let me get this right.
[82:19.14]How would you not see a gigantic bear trap on the ground?
[82:21.60]That's what I want to know.
[82:22.36]Okay, put it, like, right there.

[83:32.84]We have to be, right?
[83:36.00]Longcoats.
[83:37.07]Yeah, the most dangerous enemies.
[83:39.07]Hector is the only one that can take them down by himself with his axe or his bare fists.
[83:45.31]That's good to know.
[83:48.45]That's why he didn't step in the trap.
[83:51.35]Alright, we're going to have to showdown this.
[83:54.03]We're going to wait.
[83:54.81]He's going to stab this guy in the back.
[83:56.05]Hector's going to go up there and hit him with a heavy axe.
[84:03.10]Showdown mode.
[84:05.74]Is he immune to guns?
[84:11.23]I mean, he has to be, right?
[84:13.15]Alright, time for a showdown.
[84:16.71]You are going to go stab him in the back.
[84:18.67]Hector, you are going to go over here.
[84:21.25]Nobody messes with Hector.
[84:23.45]You're going to... What are you going to do?
[84:26.99]What is he going to do?
[84:28.89]Whistle?
[84:29.76]Hector, you're going to whistle.
[84:30.82]I'll use my singing voice.
[84:32.26]Yep.
[84:32.96]And then you're going to hide and attack him when he's... I don't know.
[84:41.44]Whistle!
[84:43.20]Oh, my God.
[84:43.88]You fucking did it.
[84:45.20]Just a scratch.
[84:48.15]How come he didn't whistle?
[84:49.33]Did I have to click it?
[85:03.14]I thought it was like, okay, I'm in showstopper mode.
[85:05.79]So like whistle.
[85:07.75]Whistle.
[85:08.43]Okay.
[85:09.17]I get it.
[85:09.55]You have to actually do it.
[85:11.73]You're going to go over there and you're going to stab him in the neck.
[85:14.50]And then you are going to... Is this like The Sims?
[85:17.78]If I have him do something else, will he do it?
[85:21.76]No.
[85:23.09]Let's lure someone in.
[85:26.97]Why is he a bear?
[85:28.07]What?
[85:28.33]Okay, I have to lower him.
[85:29.35]The strategy is not going to work.
[86:02.49]I mean, we could turn him around and go this way.
[86:04.11]Throw it over there.
[86:09.83]What the fuck?
[86:10.41]And then wrap around this way?
[86:27.60]I can't kill him.
[86:28.36]Axe the long coat.
[86:31.04]Isn't that going to make a huge bunch of noise?
[86:37.75]Stop being bad.
[86:38.63]I banned that guy for 10 minutes.
[86:43.93]Come on, amigo.
[86:51.60]No, I need to... Okay, I know what I... Wait, wait, wait.
[86:53.20]I have to coin him and then kill him.

[86:56.37]Ready?
[86:56.59]Point him.
[86:59.63]Kill him.

[87:26.69]Oh, you... Fucking restart the goddamn thing.
[87:33.23]Just use the axe?
[87:36.47]He's gonna... But he's gonna see that.

[87:49.84]Alright, no no no no no no this is perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect You're gonna go um You're gonna go this way You're gonna go ax him.
[88:08.59]Ax him right in the head.
[88:11.17]And then you're gonna distract him.
[88:13.79]Throw a coin right behind him.
[88:14.95]Check this shit out, go.
[88:17.36]The hell?
[88:18.56]Not your lucky day, is it?
[88:24.62]You got it, amigo.
[88:25.62]Time for the axe.
[88:27.00]Time to go.
[88:36.58]It's like slaughtering people.
[88:37.88]Alright, we have to stop doing this.
[88:41.02]I'm in the mood for some chopping.
[88:43.12]Come on, let's move.
[88:44.20]No need to hurry up.
[89:07.49]Why do they keep surviving him?
[89:12.00]I put the bear trap down right here.
[89:15.51]And then you're, do I, I didn't pick the knife up?
[89:17.85]Alright, just, no, no, no, just put it down.
[89:21.19]Ow, run!
[89:21.57]Run, run!

[89:24.89]I have to kill this guy.
[89:27.11]Oh shit.
[89:41.63]Time for the axe.
[89:47.21]Okay.
[89:49.87]I'm good.
[89:50.85]We did it.
[89:52.29]I made it.
[89:52.67]Alright.
[89:53.59]I'll take that.
[89:57.05]She looks ready for more.
[89:59.87]How do I hide all these guys?
[90:01.77]Can I throw them down the well?
[90:07.06]Come on, amigo.
[90:09.23]Yeah, I'm ready.
[90:10.87]This is nothing.
[90:13.17]Over there?
[90:14.13]No problem.
[90:15.22]Can't do it.
[90:17.20]Can't put them in the well.
[90:18.30]Why?
[90:23.54]Look, I killed everybody that would be showing up over here anyway.
[90:29.55]On my way.
[90:30.21]Does it really matter?
[90:32.71]Forget it.
[90:33.27]I can do this all day.
[90:38.94]It does?
[90:39.44]Yes?
[90:39.84]Okay.
[90:40.36]Alright, I'm doing it.
[90:42.62]This bush is going to stink after a few days, by the way.
[90:45.17]This is going to be the smelliest bush ever.
[90:48.55]People are going to be like, holy shit, someone's going to pull that up.
[90:50.73]What's wrong with that bush?
[90:51.89]It smells so bad.
[90:53.13]Let's light this up.
[91:12.37]Okay, the game is saved.
[91:13.27]We're good.
[91:13.61]Damn, that was tricky.
[91:16.13]Look at how many people.
[91:18.03]Alright, so now I can be in the town.
[91:21.23]Civil zones.
[91:22.03]Characters can move through civil zones undetected.
[91:25.01]As long as they don't act suspicious, the red marker will indicate when you are about to leave or enter a civil zone.
[91:31.75]Here we go.
[91:32.19]Look!
[91:34.71]We're just normal people.
[91:37.90]Hey, look at that.
[91:40.04]Civil.
[91:42.09]How about we just kill them in the order we like?
[91:44.54]Great plan you have there.
[91:46.08]You heard what happened with the church bell the other day?
[91:48.74]So who's on the list?
[91:49.46]Yeah, just imagine if it fell down on Sunday.
[91:52.16]Okay, kill the company thugs.
[91:53.38]Where's Jarvis?
[91:53.95]The guy over there, Wild Marge, McBain, and the Duke.
[91:59.77]Alright.
[92:02.41]Let's head up that way.
[92:04.33]Follow this guy around.
[92:05.18]Mm-hmm.
[92:06.26]Dang, I thought all this would be good for the town.
[92:10.52]We were so, so happy when the mayor told us that the railroad would come.
[92:14.42]Wait, that's the duke right there.
[92:15.28]Oh, you take a good look.
[92:17.46]It's the guy running the company.
[92:19.22]Yeah, he wants to see us gone.
[92:22.10]Doesn't give a shit about us.
[92:24.67]Yeah.
[92:25.09]We're just talking to him.
[92:25.89]Did you hear what they did to old William?
[92:28.95]Okay, then.
[92:30.65]We're no friends?
[92:32.11]Won't take long.
[92:34.97]Axe him.
[92:36.89]I'm not going to just do that.
[92:39.93]I need to have at least somewhat of a plan.
[92:42.31]Where does he go?
[92:45.58]I want to see.
[92:46.58]Does he leave the civil zone?
[92:48.78]Okay, now what if I put a trap right when he comes over here?
[92:51.20]Will this guy see?
[92:51.80]Alright, here we go.
[92:54.16]We're going to try this.
[92:54.86]Okay.
[92:59.79]Oh, coin right there.
[93:00.55]Hmm.
[93:00.73]Hmm.
[93:22.63]I think I can get that to work.
[93:24.11]I really do.
[93:24.75]He's trying to catch a bear.
[93:28.15]They're walking around it.
[93:29.31]Too many of these people are going to look around.
[93:33.39]Where are you looking?
[93:35.17]You're looking straight ahead.
[93:36.93]You're just a civilian.
[93:37.94]Who cares if you see a guy put a bear trap down?
[93:40.04]Get out of here.
[93:41.20]Wait, what's this?
[93:44.48]What's this bell?
[93:45.08]Wait, I can throw somebody in a coffin?
[93:48.42]Okay.
[93:48.62]Okay.
[93:48.76]I can get over here like this.
[93:50.34]This is still a civil zone.
[93:52.81]I'm allowed to be here.
[93:55.29]Okay.
[94:11.28]Wait, this isn't going to kill anybody that's right there?
[94:14.32]There's so many ways to kill people.
[94:17.22]Is that going to kill this guy too, right?
[94:18.47]Is he going to walk over here and I'm going to Looney Tunes this guy?
[94:23.13]Yeah, I can.
[94:23.41]Hooper, you go over there.
[94:24.15]This is a civil zone, right?
[94:25.19]You think this is funny?
[94:40.43]It's not a civil zone anymore when you go through there.
[94:45.87]Is he going to walk through here?
[94:46.61]Okay, so this is not a civil zone anymore.
[94:51.40]Not yet.
[94:51.90]Now I want you... Get over here.
[94:55.46]You climb this.
[94:57.46]Right?
[94:57.84]Only Cooper can climb fucking trees.
[95:00.03]Alright, we'll switch.
[95:06.30]Yeah, I'm obviously gonna squash this guy.
[95:10.08]Get everybody in the right position.
[95:13.66]Save the game.
[95:14.26]Alright, I'm gonna squash the guy first.
[95:15.68]I'm gonna sneak over here.
[95:31.04]You're looking this way.
[95:32.28]I'm safe all the way until right here.
[95:36.30]These two are talking.
[95:37.16]I could probably trap this guy if I wanted to.
[95:50.11]shit what oh no god damn it alright I gotta take these guys out one by one then I'm gonna trap right here and I'm gonna whistle somebody and someone's gonna die hurry up
[96:17.75]Hey there.
[96:18.69]You.
[96:18.93]You enjoying yourself yet, Cooper?
[96:21.17]This way, amigo.
[96:22.59]This is where they're laying the tracks.
[96:25.07]McBain's the foreman and doesn't let anyone inside.
[96:27.85]Then let's keep quiet when we head in.
[96:29.73]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[96:32.75]Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[96:35.61]I can't help it.
[96:35.99]I have the fucking wood.
[96:36.91]This place?
[96:38.47]Fuck me.
[96:40.07]They heard that?
[96:40.85]Hey, don't move.
[96:43.51]Fuck, they can see me.
[96:44.81]Girl, it's wood.
[96:45.64]Cover me.
[96:46.16]How does this...
[96:50.90]I have to distract everybody.
[96:54.08]Okay.
[96:55.92]I can't go through there.
[96:57.96]You're going up here.
[96:58.56]I'm changing you.
[97:00.94]Does anybody care that I'm doing this?
[97:04.38]I don't think so, right?
[97:14.36]Alright, let's take a look.
[97:15.52]I gotta get up there.
[97:18.45]This guy's looking straight ahead.
[97:20.31]Who cares?
[97:20.73]I care about this guy.
[97:26.65]I think I can just knife him.
[97:28.26]Right now.
[97:29.62]This guy's fucking dead.
[97:32.26]Let's go.
[97:33.70]Nobody else, right?
[97:39.10]This dude is looking straight ahead that way.
[97:41.54]Am I just going to throw the bell at him?
[97:45.54]Shall we?
[97:50.32]What do I do with the belt?
[97:53.32]Oh.
[97:57.42]I'm gonna kill this guy.
[98:01.37]Here he comes.
[98:06.43]This guy's dead.
[98:11.76]Hurry up.
[98:14.16]What's that noise?
[98:18.19]It's not your lucky day, is it?
[98:20.43]One down, three to go.
[98:21.93]What about the coffin?
[98:22.93]These guys didn't even care.
[98:26.74]Did I throw him in the coffin?
[98:31.20]Why does this coffin exist?
[98:32.30]It seems weird, right?
[98:36.48]What do I do?
[98:42.19]Alright, I'm gonna go.
[98:42.63]I'm jumping down.
[98:43.45]Wait.
[98:45.10]How the hell did that happen?
[98:46.76]Who needs a good killing?
[98:48.02]Damn shit.
[98:50.14]I'll get close in person.
[98:52.30]You see that?
[98:53.02]If you find them... I'm supposed to stay up here.
[98:56.73]Okay, now wait, wait, wait.
[98:57.59]Are these guys coming?
[98:59.73]No one's gonna check the roof.
[99:00.55]They gotta be around here somewhere.
[99:02.47]They're getting away!
[99:07.90]Sneaky motherfuckers.
[99:12.59]I'm really going to have to sneak through here, aren't I?
[99:14.18]I might have to go a different way.
[99:16.74]Okay, now I'm going to get... This is the only guy that stays down here.
[99:31.23]That was my fault?
[99:32.45]Yeah, well, just hold on.
[99:33.07]Watch.
[99:37.21]Can't just jump off the roof?
[99:37.87]Okay, now I'm going to sneak behind this guy.
[99:43.62]Knock him out, and I'm going to bury him.
[99:49.18]This is fucked up.
[99:53.46]Do I not do this?
[99:54.40]A lot of people can fit in here, apparently.
[99:56.28]Okay.
[100:16.27]Anything else?
[100:16.73]I have to actually be careful here.
[100:19.30]There's one guy pointing this way.
[100:20.42]I'm just going to hide.
[100:20.94]I'm going to climb back around.
[100:28.36]Clown coffin.
[100:31.00]I'll continue.
[100:31.42]What are you doing?
[100:32.70]On my way.
[100:33.28]Alright.

[101:19.93]Climb up there.
[101:20.89]Alright.
[101:21.21]Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[113:38.96]Sure is.
[113:41.10]Who was that?
[113:44.24]Don't think of an itch.
[113:47.50]Come on, let's move it.
[113:48.72]No more surprises.
[113:49.82]Did someone come through here?
[113:59.14]OH!
[113:59.36]No shit!
[113:59.96]They didn't see me, he didn't see, he didn't see.
[114:04.37]It's okay.
[114:05.15]And look, it doesn't matter.
[114:05.99]I'm gonna show time, we're gonna kill all three of them.
[114:23.74]Okay, good, good.
[114:24.58]Now, show stop.
[114:26.03]We're gonna go coin on you.
[114:27.29]You're gonna get up and you're gonna hit this guy in the fucking head with an axe.
[114:30.51]Go for it.
[114:33.51]Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink!
[114:39.33]Fuck!
[114:40.54]Use your guns?
[114:41.44]I can't... Wait, why am I... Okay, we're fine.
[114:46.24]Okay.
[114:54.10]You can shoot two at once.
[114:55.05]Yeah, but then like the whole town gets alerted.
[114:58.41]Not a problem.
[115:00.75]Son of a bitch.
[115:02.23]No!
[115:02.61]Okay, we're fine.
[115:12.44]It was an overreaction.
[115:18.03]You show that bull who's boss.
[115:20.47]Boss?
[115:22.81]I have to be patient.
[115:32.27]I have to be patient.
[115:39.59]Don't even kill these guys.
[115:40.55]It's not even worth it.
[115:41.69]This does nothing for me.
[115:48.68]They're going to go up here, and then we're going to go into the bush.
[115:52.44]This guy is a pain in the ass.
[115:54.48]We have to make it into this bush.
[115:56.25]That's it.
[115:58.73]What the fuck are you doing, Jeremy?
[116:00.79]What is wrong with you?
[116:02.47]What's wrong with you?
[116:03.31]Why would you move?
[116:04.25]Why would you do that?
[116:04.93]What's wrong with you?
[116:05.47]Are you insane?
[116:07.71]Come on.
[116:19.43]Get in there.
[116:19.77]Get in the bush.
[116:22.19]Okay, good.
[116:22.97]Perfect, perfect.
[116:23.55]Now we have an opportunity here.
[116:24.84]I can kill him.
[116:27.48]Nobody's around, right?
[116:29.64]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[116:34.80]They're not going to look over here, though.
[116:40.25]Shit.
[116:40.39]Don't let them get away.
[116:48.45]I'm going to end up killing every single guard here somehow.
[116:51.49]And this is the last guy.
[116:52.55]And I'm just going to be able to shoot him.
[116:54.66]We're not going to be able to do the fun hitman mission completion thing with the bull kicking him in the head.
[116:59.18]I'm just going to walk up and stab him.
[117:01.24]There you are.
[117:01.68]What do you mean there you are?
[117:20.35]Wait.
[117:21.47]Okay.
[117:23.39]Opportunity coming in about five seconds.
[117:25.05]Five, four, three, two.
[117:26.96]I like it.
[117:27.68]Okay.
[117:32.02]Good.
[117:32.48]Done.
[117:34.32]We're pretty much done.
[117:39.58]These guys leave?
[117:42.22]Let's do this.
[117:43.24]So who should do this?
[117:43.98]Should I do it with, uh, Cooper?
[117:45.32]Okay, wait.
[117:48.62]But, um...
[117:51.44]Uh, I don't know.
[117:52.32]I don't know what to do right now.
[117:56.56]Um.
[118:00.24]Somebody has to sneak around.
[118:02.58]Can't see back here.
[118:05.84]This guy's gonna die.
[118:15.09]Hmm?
[118:15.79]I mean, I could whistle this guy over with the trap, right?
[118:17.89]Let's try that.
[118:20.45]These guys are going to come around, the patrol will be gone, and they'll put the trap down here and let this guy over instead.
[118:29.08]Boing the cull.
[118:29.92]Alright, this should be good.
[118:32.46]Ready?
[118:33.50]Get him!
[118:36.52]Hide him quick!
[118:50.59]Yep.
[118:51.05]Done.
[118:53.99]Now this guy is fucked.
[118:56.39]Now I can... Okay, so let's do the fun thing.
[119:01.37]They're not going to see this and be suspicious, right?
[119:17.79]Will this guy go back to normal?
[119:26.83]I could knife him right now, but that's not fun.
[119:29.39]New hint.
[119:32.39]Oh.
[119:34.63]A not-so-gifted worker built this sign.
[119:38.82]Oh.
[119:39.06]Oh.
[119:42.51]No, I don't just want to knife him.
[119:43.79]That sucks.
[119:44.69]I want to, like, kill him fun.
[119:47.15]In, like, a crazy way, right?
[119:49.29]Let's go.
[119:56.76]I got lots of these.
[119:58.50]The old man.
[120:01.94]What did I do?
[120:03.04]What did I do?
[120:05.59]I didn't do anything.
[120:06.83]What?
[120:06.93]The coin?
[120:07.25]I threw the coin at him before and he didn't do anything.
[120:22.32]They won't see us coming.
[120:25.42]Let's do this.
[120:27.32]Yeah, I did.
[120:31.52]When I was standing back here, I threw it right there.
[120:33.68]Wait, you have to throw it.
[120:40.45]It has to hit the ball.
[120:49.39]He's not ready to go back yet.
[120:57.42]I mean, I threw the coin right here and it was like in the circle.
[120:59.66]I didn't know I had to throw it and hit the bowl with it.
[121:01.79]I got it.
[121:05.11]I got it.
[121:06.83]I got it.
[121:07.11]I got it.
[121:07.63]I got it.
[121:08.05]Go down.
[121:09.71]Wild Marge is in here.
[121:10.87]We're just going to go in there.
[121:25.56]We're not done yet, amigo.
[121:27.50]Wait, hold on.

[121:40.67]What happened?
[121:41.25]The whorehouse.
[121:42.81]Townsville can't go in since Wild Marge took over.
[121:45.57]Why?
[121:45.69]Not the front door, then.
[121:47.49]Alright.
[121:48.47]Keep it low.
[121:49.77]We cannot go in.
[121:50.19]Let's find another way in.
[121:52.15]Okay, well, we obviously have to go around here through the back.
[121:55.33]Nice house.
[121:57.33]Okay, okay, okay.
[122:18.17]Why did I think that was going to work?
[122:21.67]Why would that work in any video game that had any mechanics like this?
[122:25.35]Why did I think I could just skip the whole thing and run?
[122:27.17]In the bush.
[122:36.42]In the bush, Cooper, please.
[122:44.74]Okay, tactics have to work out here.
[122:47.00]Okay, ready?
[122:47.54]I'm gonna throw a coin right here.
[122:50.82]Showtime.
[122:51.88]Alright.

[126:15.38]It's actually softlocked.
[126:16.54]It's softlocked if you... I'm trying to pay attention.

[130:07.24]No one's gonna come back here.
[130:09.00]Don't even hide them.
[130:09.74]Save it.
[130:10.02]Let's go.
[130:13.74]I have plenty of bullets.
[130:16.52]Now what?
[130:22.32]Go right there.
[130:23.04]We could probably... Alright, I'm going to trap this guy.
[130:24.85]Don't do that.
[130:27.53]Get out of here.
[130:28.33]Let's keep moving around this side.
[130:29.97]Like this.
[130:30.23]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[130:31.59]Go up here.
[130:45.65]Ah, this is just another way to get over here.
[130:46.96]Alright, cool.
[130:48.62]Multiple ways to do the level.
[130:49.62]That's cool.
[130:56.30]This guy's not going to see it.
[130:57.10]We can just move.
[130:58.19]I killed the other two guys.
[131:01.21]Yeah, listen, VOD Watchers, he refuses to get the knife for another 40 minutes to preserve his pride and then pretends it was his idea to get it.
[131:07.24]I'm gonna- Hey, VOD Watchers, don't listen to that guy.
[131:10.70]I know that I need to go get the knife, and, like, I'm- It's not my idea.
[131:14.18]Somebody in chat said, dude, get the fucking knife, so I'm gonna go get it.
[131:16.86]I have- This is not me saying that.
[131:18.96]This is somebody in chat told me to get that.
[131:20.40]I want to correct that person, ban that person for five minutes.
[131:26.85]Okay.
[131:27.65]Save it here.
[131:29.96]Dude, skip this part.
[131:31.22]Why would you skip this part?
[131:32.27]Okay, here we go.
[131:39.79]I need to get in here.
[131:41.91]This is such a pain in the ass.
[131:44.42]Like, why can't I just eat this guy or absorb this guy and take his stuff?
[131:48.54]Two people is too hard.
[131:49.46]Okay.
[132:01.14]This guy's got a clean look this way.
[132:03.74]We have to pull this guy.
[132:05.26]I'm going to set the trap down here.
[132:06.66]Right here.
[132:07.30]You're not going to see this, right?
[132:09.56]I'm going to whistle him over.
[132:10.85]He didn't hear it.
[132:11.59]Okay, will he hear this?
[132:32.03]Shit.
[132:32.43]He's not going to hear this.
[132:35.09]Alright.
[132:35.35]Pack it up.
[132:35.83]Get it again.
[132:36.27]Pick it up.
[132:36.67]Can I pick it up?
[132:38.67]Where's the fast forward button?
[132:45.46]Um.
[132:47.42]There is a fast forward button.
[132:49.06]I don't like this.
[132:49.56]This way, amigo.
[133:01.82]Put the trap down here.
[133:04.92]I can get it there.
[133:07.36]What if the alka is ready?
[133:09.60]You got it, amigo.
[133:13.82]Let's lure someone in.
[133:17.14]You enjoy it?
[133:18.34]You still got it.
[133:31.76]Wait, wait, wait.
[133:32.26]What do I do?
[133:32.70]I have to show stop because now there's a guy coming.
[133:37.99]Just shoot him.
[133:39.07]I just shoot him.
[133:40.69]I think I'm just going to shoot him.
[133:41.97]Oh, my God.
[134:00.06]Maybe I shouldn't even kill this guy.
[134:02.18]Yeah, I got it.
[134:04.36]I gotta go get the knife.
[134:05.33]Okay, fine, fine.
[134:06.35]He's going on an expedition to get his knife, alright?
[134:08.25]Are you happy?
[134:10.03]He's gonna go get his knife.
[134:11.09]Let's get going.
[134:21.74]Come on.
[134:43.49]Here.
[134:43.75]Are we happy now?
[134:47.43]And it's reload.
[134:50.89]What do I mean that's not right?
[134:55.99]What?
[134:56.29]Oh, because I jumped...
[135:15.34]No, I can't kill this guy.
[135:17.54]No, I have the knife.
[135:18.90]I didn't save it.
[135:19.54]I'm fine.
[135:23.36]I'm not soft-locked.
[135:24.37]We're good.
[135:26.37]I'm no longer illegal, so... Why does he care?
[135:29.29]Alright, here we go.
[135:40.71]Nobody cares.
[135:42.20]Let's move.
[135:44.19]There's this one guy here.
[135:45.11]I'm gonna knife him.
[135:49.22]Do the food pyramid.
[135:50.62]Food pyramid.
[135:51.28]Alright, hold on.
[135:52.26]Let me at least beat this level.
[135:53.82]I got two more people to kill.
[135:56.66]I'll do my food pyramid soon.
[135:59.08]Hold on.
[135:59.58]I just gotta kill this guy.
[136:04.23]I wish I went at the worst possible time.
[136:06.41]Alright, I'm gonna save it here.
[136:14.91]Good.
[136:17.01]And go.
[136:19.45]Hi, I'm back.
[136:20.05]I have my knife.
[136:20.67]You ready to fucking play the game?
[136:22.27]Sure.
[136:22.82]Sounds like a lot of fun.
[136:24.26]Why don't you whisper this guy over here?
[136:25.92]Why don't you whistle?
[136:27.22]Just whistle at him.
[136:28.70]And, like, he'll walk over here.
[136:32.52]And then I'll knife him in the head.
[136:34.78]That sounds like a lot of fun.
[136:37.73]Would you look at that?
[136:39.33]Dead.
[136:41.53]Now go get him.
[136:42.47]Pick up that.
[136:43.03]And don't stay over here.
[136:52.16]Okay, now go get him.
[136:53.22]Well, now.
[136:54.00]Let's see.
[136:56.26]And up.
[136:59.28]Stuff him in there.
[137:01.66]Save the game.
[137:04.22]And we're cool.
[137:05.18]I'm just getting started.
[137:06.60]We're good.
[137:08.24]Good.
[137:08.82]Alright.
[137:09.36]Now I can go this way.
[137:12.14]Oh, yeah.
[137:15.28]Okay.
[137:15.74]I feel good.
[137:17.57]Jerma's voice sounds like he's crying.
[137:20.96]Kind of a weird observation, but alright.
[137:23.06]I like it.
[137:32.37]Dude, this dude's crying.
[137:34.13]You hear this guy?
[137:36.31]Dude on stream just fucking bawling his eyes out.
[137:39.31]Check out this whorehouse.
[137:41.03]We're just building in town.
[137:42.67]This place reminds me of the one in Deadwood.
[137:44.89]There's lots of whorehouses in Deadwood.
[137:48.00]You know the one where they kicked me out?
[137:49.82]That doesn't narrow it.
[137:54.10]Good to see you, amigo.
[137:55.97]Put this down.
[137:56.63]Bianca is ready.
[137:57.57]I feel like Bianca, this is... This item is stupid.
[138:02.23]I would just knife a guy and pick the knife up.
[138:08.33]Can do.
[138:15.72]I feel like this thing is stupid.
[138:17.32]It takes so long and I can just knife a guy.
[138:23.89]Alright, this is the last guy.
[138:43.81]And we're going in the house.
[138:44.95]And I'm just going to get up there.
[138:46.51]And I'm going to shoot her.
[138:49.93]Keep using it.
[138:51.25]Yeah, I know.
[138:51.63]Let's go.
[138:57.42]What's up?
[139:05.34]This is the best tactic.
[139:10.00]Just whistle and then knife.
[139:11.86]It works every time.
[139:13.96]It's the best tactic.
[139:17.24]Is this gonna go in the front door?
[139:21.03]I wanted to use the knife, but that works too.
[139:33.06]Oh shit.
[139:33.38]Get in!
[139:34.48]Where's the other guy?
[139:37.06]Wait, where is he?
[139:38.20]Where's Cooper?
[139:38.84]Where's Cooper?
[139:40.72]Where's Cooper?
[139:42.60]Oh god, run!
[140:02.75]I know they're here.
[140:04.41]Keep looking.
[140:05.13]There's always a way.
[140:08.61]You still up there?
[140:09.64]Wait, did I kill her?
[140:11.98]Wait a minute.
[140:28.85]Oh, no.
[140:29.51]Okay.
[140:30.75]That's Wild Marge.
[140:31.77]Alright.
[140:32.07]Alright.
[140:32.43]Alright.
[140:32.65]Alright.
[140:34.99]Back in there.
[140:36.43]On my way.
[140:37.09]Get the fuck out.
[140:43.87]This guy's going to come back in.
[140:44.79]Okay.
[140:45.02]No one's coming in here.
[140:45.82]We're fine.
[140:48.56]What's this?
[140:51.48]Maybe we could put something in the whiskey.
[140:53.58]Hey, amigo.
[140:55.62]Think we could do something to the whiskey?
[140:58.10]Um.
[141:00.17]I guess.
[141:10.02]Put something fucked up in the whiskey?
[141:11.98]Where can I get that?
[141:14.90]Nah.
[141:15.92]Nah.
[141:16.64]Nah.
[141:17.28]Nah.
[141:17.74]Let's just kill her.
[141:19.24]I'm not going to go find the poison.
[141:20.52]No.
[141:20.72]I'm not going to go find it.
[141:21.80]Let's just go kill her.
[141:31.66]Pretty good Sims game.
[141:33.29]This is the best Sims mod I think I've ever played.
[141:38.33]I'm gonna kill this guy right here.
[141:40.73]I'm gonna knife him.
[141:47.52]That's not what I wanted to do.
[141:50.00]I'm doing a target practice.
[142:01.69]It's like right before the ninja throws the smoke bomb down and disappears.
[142:13.16]If you don't get it off, you can't do your magic trick.
[142:15.68]You just die.
[142:17.30]You're just dead.
[142:23.29]This is the guy that has to die.
[142:47.85]Get him.
[142:48.07]Get him.
[142:48.51]Get him.
[142:49.53]Get him.
[142:50.00]Two guys, two guys, two guys, two guys.
[142:53.91]Move.
[143:04.53]They don't go in here, right?
[143:05.61]Oh, they do go.
[143:06.09]Wait, he's leaning.
[143:06.69]He's under the desk, though.
[143:09.57]Do they care?
[143:11.87]Sure thing.
[143:13.89]Shit!
[143:15.64]Did someone come through here?
[143:18.18]Whoever finds them gets their stuff.
[143:20.90]This is amnesia?
[143:23.00]For fuck's sake, where are they?
[143:26.94]They're getting away!
[143:28.10]Something fierce.
[143:31.77]The next guy that comes in here is gonna get jumped.
[143:42.03]Okay, how many of you guys have played this game with your dog?

[145:17.17]I'm going to drag him in here.
[145:18.23]I don't think these guys come in this room.

[159:37.72]How the fuck?
[159:38.36]Okay.
[159:39.06]Coin?
[159:39.32]Get out there and throw a coin?

[159:40.72]Let's see what happens.
[159:48.88]What's that noise?
[159:49.78]Not a problem.
[159:51.42]What's that?
[159:51.84]What's that?
[159:54.10]I didn't even know this existed, but okay.
[159:55.82]We're okay.
[159:57.16]These company assholes are everywhere.

[160:37.16]Who has eyes on this?
[160:39.00]Nobody does.
[160:39.74]This is the only guy that has any eyes at all.
[160:41.32]And he can't see right here.
[160:43.14]No one's paying attention.
[160:43.84]This guy's barely paying attention.
[160:56.52]Imagine playing Desperados 3 instead of Desperados 4.
[160:58.08]He was like trying to run away.
[160:59.06]What am I doing?
[161:00.38]I was looking at chat and somebody was talking.
[161:25.43]Sure thing.

[167:38.57]So there's no first person in this game, huh?
[168:01.18]First person in the last one.
[168:02.22]That was really fun.
[168:03.30]Although, everybody hated it, right?
[168:05.66]That's right, amigo.
[168:06.08]Now...
[168:30.63]That's a really detailed message.
[168:33.37]I don't even know what it means, so I'm not going to answer it.
[168:34.89]Okay.
[168:44.92]Make the deaths look like accidents.
[168:48.54]What was the... Oh, the girl.
[168:50.82]Don't kill or knock out anyone in the train track area.
[168:53.12]That didn't happen.
[168:53.72]Don't touch any bushes or haystacks.
[168:55.46]How would you do that?
[168:58.91]Kill three mission targets at the same time.
[169:03.59]What?
[169:07.16]So you poison her drink.
[169:09.98]Obviously.
[169:11.82]You then split them up to knock him down with a showstopper and do the coin in the bowl.
[169:16.72]Let's see what happened.
[169:25.77]We started here.
[169:27.95]Okay, we'll do times 16.
[169:29.57]I remember this part being really, really hard.
[169:37.71]For no reason.
[169:38.35]I don't know why.
[169:40.37]Circles.
[169:46.24]Do not.
[169:47.32]Do not.
[169:48.40]Please do not make...
[169:58.65]Thank you.
[170:13.04]We came all the way back down here.
[170:18.82]It's the bowl part.
[170:19.70]Yeah, I didn't do this right.
[170:27.68]It's gonna be a lot of saves.
[170:28.70]Okay, now the real four-hour long joke here would be if I made sure that I walked on the map in a way that I spelled out, fuck you.
[170:48.44]Now that's the real four-hour joke.
[170:50.50]I'm not sure I'm willing to do it.
[170:55.35]And I just play the game, and I'm playing terribly.
[170:57.83]And everyone's like, why is he playing, like, such shit?
[170:59.43]This is terrible.
[171:00.15]Like, why is he doing it like this?
[171:01.19]This is, like, absolutely brainless.
[171:03.61]And then at the end, you see that I just spelt out, fuck you.
[171:08.01]Hmm.
[171:08.59]Maybe.
[171:10.82]Too long.
[171:20.72]How many saves?
[171:21.34]32 reloads?
[171:22.90]32 saves?
[171:23.64]Where are they?
[171:24.30]Right here?
[171:27.78]Oh, right.
[171:28.42]Hold on, because I went... Is this when I... Is it when I went back to get the knife?
[171:33.14]Right.
[171:44.14]So inefficient.
[172:05.98]The life of a camper.
[172:07.13]This would just be embarrassing if you showed this back to me if I was playing Call of Duty or something.
[172:22.04]Would you ever eat human meat?
[172:24.12]It's human meat.
[172:26.26]I'm not going to eat human meat.
[172:27.24]I would never eat human meat.
[172:28.66]What the fuck are you talking about?
[172:39.01]Not even a little?
[172:39.73]No, never.
[172:40.15]Not once.
[172:40.71]Ever.
[172:53.44]Nothing.
[172:56.99]Hey, we did it.
[172:57.41]53 minutes.
[173:01.25]65 loads?
[173:01.67]That's a lot.
[173:04.23]Okay. 65.
[173:07.87]A 65 saves.
[173:08.69]Okay.
[173:12.37]I seem to like to play as Cooper more than any other character, I guess.
[173:15.15]Ooh, what civilian died?
[173:22.41]One civilian died?
[173:23.47]Who was it?
[173:23.87]I don't know who that is.
[173:33.74]What if a human was prepared by a master chef?
[173:36.82]No.
[173:38.55]It's not gonna happen.
[173:39.79]Alright, I gotta pee.
[173:40.69]When I come back, we're gonna do my food pyramid.
[173:42.61]I'm gonna show you, because everyone was talking shit about what I eat.
[173:45.47]Do my food pyramid.
[173:47.26]Be right back.
[176:40.61]Okay.
[176:42.47]So.
[176:46.06]People ask.
[176:47.08]In the pre-streams.
[176:48.48]Whatever.
[176:49.28]The thing that happened before I turned on the live stream.
[176:52.50]We're talking about food.
[176:54.22]I was trying to talk my case about how I eat peanut butter.
[176:58.78]That's insane apparently.
[176:59.86]Eating peanut butter is fucking crazy.
[177:02.25]Eating peanut butter is like eating humans.
[177:05.17]To a lot of you.
[177:06.51]But we'll go over it.
[177:07.05]We'll talk about it.
[177:09.27]So I have over here.
[177:11.65]turn this down you don't need to hear this fucking music right now okay let's go so what you have in front of you is uh it is a pyramid now most of a long time ago the pyramid used to be like this you know this is back in like the fucking 30s it was like
[177:38.62]Like this, well, why is it a weird color?
[177:41.18]This was essentially the food pyramid back in like fucking 1938.
[177:43.92]Or like 1940, whatever, 1950.
[177:46.26]I cannot select it.
[177:53.01]Okay, you had bread and beer.
[177:56.49]I think my computer crashed.
[177:58.25]Come on.
[178:04.10]Fuck.
[178:05.66]No.
[178:06.50]Wait, hold on.
[178:12.24]What the fuck is going on with my computer?
[178:19.29]What?
[178:20.87]Stop!
[178:22.89]How do I get rid of this?
[178:34.12]Where's the brushes?
[178:38.70]Okay, honestly.
[178:40.89]Where's the brunt?
[178:41.61]How do I get rid of this?
[178:42.73]Holy shit.
[178:43.65]What the hell was that?
[178:44.65]Alright, anyways.
[178:47.43]Here we go.
[178:52.52]What do I eat the least of?
[178:55.81]The thing that I eat the least of, let me put it up here, this is because a pyramid is supposed to be this is what you eat the least of, alright?
[179:00.33]And this is dead serious.
[179:02.21]I do not eat anymore, really at all.
[179:05.31]I don't have dairy ever.
[179:07.32]Literally ever.
[179:08.16]Not ass.
[179:10.16]Dairy.
[179:11.70]Like milk.
[179:12.72]I don't eat drink, I don't eat milk, I don't have, it fucks me up, I have intestinal, I have intestinal diarrheal problems.
[179:20.10]So milk does not really do well for me anymore.
[179:22.52]So up here is milk.
[179:27.71]This is like milk.
[179:29.75]And can we not make it like 600 font, please?
[179:35.01]Milk.
[179:36.09]Okay.
[179:39.55]Milk.
[179:40.59]That's way too fucking small.
[179:43.62]There.
[179:45.06]Milk.
[179:46.36]Dairy.
[179:47.82]Cheese.
[179:50.14]I don't eat any of these things really at all anymore.
[179:54.94]Not good for me.
[179:55.98]Doesn't do it for me.
[179:56.68]I can't do it.
[179:59.01]That's probably what I eat the least.
[180:00.81]What about pizza?
[180:01.51]I don't eat pizza anymore.
[180:03.93]I don't.
[180:04.31]I really just don't.
[180:05.13]I swear to God.
[180:06.11]I promise.
[180:08.59]Alright, what do I eat the most of?
[180:09.83]Here's what I eat the most of.
[180:12.23]Most of my food comes from... Shit, this is kind of weird.
[180:17.33]Like the biggest... It's not bread.
[180:20.03]Bread's like here.
[180:25.78]I'm going to make this be bread.
[180:29.83]I don't really eat bread.
[180:31.27]I try to stay away from white bread, wheat bread.
[180:33.95]That doesn't sit well with me either.
[180:36.30]Plus, with all these medical problems, I've been trying to have a better diet.
[180:39.50]But I never really ate that much bread anyways.
[180:43.12]It's chocolate milk.
[180:44.10]No, not milk.
[180:45.42]I don't drink milk.
[180:47.84]So this would be bread?
[180:49.12]And flour.
[180:53.58]Bread and flour.
[180:54.32]What?
[180:54.50]What?
[180:58.38]Bread, flour, pasta.
[181:01.74]I don't eat it.
[181:05.30]And then the next thing.
[181:06.64]Okay, what do I eat the most?
[181:11.68]Probably turkey.
[181:12.50]Yeah.
[181:20.70]It's definitely turkey.
[181:21.50]I eat turkeys number one.
[181:24.88]Turkey.
[181:25.28]Yeah, definitely turkey.
[181:32.78]I have turkey probably four times a week.
[181:36.81]Three or four times a week, I will eat turkey.
[181:38.51]But also, turkey and chicken, I think, are on this list here.
[181:47.91]No, that's not even true.
[181:49.69]That's really not it.
[181:50.25]That's a lie.
[181:51.46]Turkey.
[181:51.78]I eat the most turkey.
[181:52.50]It's all turkey.
[181:53.66]I'm a huge turkey guy.
[182:01.53]I can't move this but whatever you get the idea so poultry yeah but I eat turkey way more than chicken just because turkey's a lot leaner doesn't have a lot of fat in it it's just much better for you it's I like it I love it it was captain crunch okay I'm gonna show you guys what I might what it used to be this is what it is now healthy I'm trying to be a healthy person I will show you what my food pyramid used to be I promise
[182:32.21]up here you've got probably fish salmon tuna let's do that salmon's pink so I eat a shitload of salmon I need a shitload of tuna I eat a lot of it I eat more turkey than I eat tuna I'm gonna write fish
[182:55.70]There.
[182:56.32]Fish.
[182:57.34]Turkey, number one.
[182:58.14]My main source of food is turkey and then fish.
[183:01.82]And then right here underneath that, you got your vegetables.
[183:03.68]This is green vegetables.
[183:04.70]Kale.
[183:05.56]Broccoli.
[183:06.08]Spinach.
[183:06.36]I'm a huge baby kale fan.
[183:12.09]Let's do that.
[183:12.71]So that's about right here.
[183:14.31]Fill that in.
[183:20.97]I'm really trying to be accurate with this.
[183:22.64]Greens.
[183:24.16]Greens.
[183:27.91]There.
[183:28.33]Green.
[183:28.71]Yeah.
[183:28.97]There's a lot of greens.
[183:34.28]And then there's a whole lot of shit in here that kind of doesn't exist.
[183:39.84]I do really eat just like a bunch of green vegetables, fish, and turkey.
[183:46.20]And then also, very important, right underneath this is nuts and seeds.
[183:51.87]I want to change this color because I like this.
[183:54.23]This is more of like a bread and pasta color.
[183:58.39]Yeah, that's better.
[184:00.79]Up next, you got probably fruits.
[184:05.41]I eat a shitload of bananas.
[184:06.59]I eat a shitload of blueberries.
[184:07.52]Bananas are my favorite thing in the world.
[184:08.66]You're eating a bird diet.
[184:13.56]Well, it's not a bird diet yet.
[184:15.86]Bird diet would be seeds down here.
[184:17.50]I eat turkey.
[184:18.44]I eat the birds.
[184:20.65]I mean, it is a bird diet because I eat mostly birds.
[184:23.43]So if that's what you meant, then that's fine.
[184:28.72]Why am I getting, like, the scared face?
[184:31.72]You guys probably eat, like, a six-piece chicken nugget three times a week.
[184:35.23]What are you talking about?
[184:35.85]Because I used to do that.
[184:37.29]I'm telling you.
[184:37.67]We're going to do my neck.
[184:38.29]We're going to do my before pyramid.
[184:40.72]This is the after pyramid.
[184:44.50]Okay, so up here you have... Next is... This is... Fruits.
[184:49.50]No, that's a fucking lie.
[184:51.55]That is such a lie.
[184:52.83]I'm just... That's absolutely pretending.
[184:54.85]I eat maybe like one or two bananas a week or something.
[184:58.15]It's probably up here.
[184:59.35]That's a lie.
[184:59.97]I'm just lying to you.
[185:00.99]Is it gonna be fruits?
[185:11.72]Alright, this is fruits.
[185:12.26]Fruits.
[185:14.79]And then I gotta think of, like, servings a day.
[185:16.85]Right?
[185:20.41]Why is that so powerful looking?
[185:22.74]Okay.
[185:24.10]Alright, there you go.
[185:24.72]Then you got greens, your fish, your turkey, your fruit, your bread, your flour, your milk.
[185:28.72]Your nuts and your seeds.
[185:34.12]Okay, nuts and seeds.
[185:35.24]We'll probably go right above fruit.
[185:38.41]That's the nuts and seeds right there.
[185:39.77]Okay, here we go.
[185:41.13]By the way, this is almonds.
[185:41.89]Almonds.
[185:43.48]No, fuck, that's a lie.
[185:45.15]Oh, no.
[185:45.77]Wait a minute.
[185:47.53]I think it's above greens.
[185:49.59]It is.
[185:49.81]It definitely is.
[185:52.57]I eat so much peanut butter all the time.
[185:54.43]Like, it's definitely peanut butter up here.
[185:56.59]It has to be.
[185:58.39]Yep.
[185:59.85]This is fake.
[186:01.27]This is peanut butter.
[186:05.02]It's not greens.
[186:05.54]It's peanut butter.
[186:10.10]How do I...
[186:17.25]This is peanut butter, sunflower seeds, nuts and seeds.
[186:22.01]And you know what?
[186:22.63]90% of this is peanut butter.
[186:25.39]I love it.
[186:25.93]I love it so much.
[186:26.83]Alright, you get the point.
[186:39.02]Well, it's not all peanut butter.
[186:40.82]It's mostly peanut butter.
[186:41.90]I'm just going to say nuts and seeds.
[186:47.44]Okay.
[186:47.90]Then it's vegetables.
[186:49.42]There we go.
[186:49.90]Now I got it.
[186:50.46]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[186:52.05]We're good.
[186:52.27]We're good.
[186:52.49]We're good.
[186:55.01]Then it's greens.
[186:55.91]Wait, do I eat anything else weird?
[186:58.07]What do I drink for liquids?
[187:02.55]It's probably coffee.
[187:04.71]But I'm trying not to drink coffee anymore, so this is the lie.
[187:07.69]No, it's greens.
[187:08.29]I eat shitload of kale and spinach.
[187:09.79]You guys know that.
[187:10.39]I've talked about that for years.
[187:16.19]Drink liquid.
[187:17.03]Where is weed?
[187:19.69]Don't... I don't... What are you talking about?
[187:24.26]Okay, greens.
[187:26.90]Because I don't... Wait.
[187:28.12]Greens and radishes.
[187:30.82]Okay?
[187:32.40]Because I don't eat vegetables.
[187:33.92]I don't like them.
[187:34.48]I hate them.
[187:36.39]I'm just being completely honest.
[187:38.99]If it's not a green vegetable, I don't want it.
[187:41.03]I don't like it.
[187:41.95]I'm sorry.
[187:42.39]I'm just being honest.
[187:45.31]I love broccoli, spinach, kale.
[187:50.79]And that's it.
[187:51.67]I don't like any of that.
[187:52.73]Carrots are gross.
[187:53.67]I don't like them.
[187:55.62]I'm sorry, I don't like them.
[187:59.26]I like radishes a lot.
[188:01.62]I like regular radishes, red radishes, daikon radishes.
[188:04.98]I love radishes.
[188:05.58]What about onions?
[188:07.94]No, fucking no.
[188:08.84]Onions and garlic essentially is a condiment, okay?
[188:11.68]I'm gonna put that in condiments.
[188:15.08]I love radishes.
[188:15.70]They're like the best.
[188:16.60]Radishes are like my favorite.
[188:20.11]I love radishes.
[188:20.75]Okay, like greens and radishes.
[188:22.57]Coming up next, you got condiments.
[188:27.45]I eat, okay, this is not even a lie either.
[188:32.76]I think, I mean, a lot of my diet is like mayonnaise.
[188:37.04]I probably eat as much mayonnaise as I do green vegetables.
[188:43.15]Do I?
[188:43.51]I think I might.
[188:49.72]Okay.
[189:00.40]I'm gonna write mayonnaise slash condiments.
[189:03.12]No, that's fucked up.
[189:04.56]I don't eat that much mayonnaise.
[189:05.78]Do I?
[189:06.72]Okay, here's the thing I have to ask.
[189:07.99]Do I eat more mayonnaise than I do fruit?
[189:11.71]yes I am certain of that I'm telling you right now that's 100 certain I absolutely eat more mayonnaise than fruit I eat a banana like maybe two or three times a week I put mayonnaise on everything in my tuna my fish I mayonnaise on my turkey sandwiches mayonnaise in my aioli's mayonnaise all every day
[189:39.55]Mayonnaise plus.
[189:40.59]I'm gonna write mayonnaise plus.
[189:41.96]It could be like, it could be like, I don't, but mustard sucks.
[189:44.08]Mayonnaise is the best.
[189:45.94]What about peanut butter?
[189:46.64]That goes over here.
[189:47.20]That's in the nuts and seeds.
[189:52.04]It's no, no wonder you're so sick.
[189:55.32]No, I definitely just eat way, I eat more, I eat more mayonnaise than fruit.
[190:01.26]I eat more mayonnaise than dairy.
[190:02.98]I eat more mayonnaise than flour and bread.
[190:04.92]I don't eat all these other things.
[190:07.30]I eat mayonnaise.
[190:10.80]more than I do bread.
[190:12.26]I've had mayonnaise more times in the last week than a piece of bread.
[190:15.40]That's a fact.
[190:18.26]And plus, who gives- it's just whipped up eggs and fucking oil.
[190:21.58]It's good for you.
[190:22.71]Just don't eat it every day.
[190:24.55]Don't have it in your pyramid.
[190:26.65]Okay.
[190:27.67]Listen.
[190:29.59]That leaves us with... I don't know.
[190:33.69]What else do you eat?
[190:34.31]Hey, what is here?
[190:40.67]What about drinks?
[190:44.76]Potatoes?
[190:45.36]I don't eat them.
[190:48.88]I don't eat potatoes.
[190:51.94]What about sugar and sweets?
[190:55.43]That's changed recently too.
[190:56.57]I'm going to make it like cotton candy color.
[191:06.25]I barely eat any.
[191:10.20]Like zero.
[191:14.63]You want to know where I get my sugar content from at this point right now?
[191:17.59]This is going to be like, I know people are going to go, yeah, from whatever is in the marijuana edible that I have.
[191:25.75]I'm sorry, but I have to tell you the truth.
[191:28.33]I have to tell you the truth.
[191:36.86]There, okay.
[191:40.21]It sits right at the top.
[191:41.45]It did it.
[191:41.93]It won.
[191:42.35]It won the game.
[191:43.23]Alright, now what else do I eat?
[191:46.95]Lots of turkey, lots of fish.
[191:48.89]And remember, when I write turkey here, I gotta clarify this because people are gonna think I'm a fucking psycho.
[191:54.23]I will clarify this.
[191:55.63]Turkey slash poultry.
[191:58.31]How do you spell poultry?
[192:02.54]Because people are gonna be like, what the fuck, dude?
[192:06.14]You only eat four things?
[192:07.80]No, no, no.
[192:09.34]You understand.
[192:11.60]It's mostly turkey, though.
[192:12.93]Mostly turkey and poultry.
[192:14.23]Like chicken.
[192:15.03]Turkey.
[192:18.33]I would just write poultry, but I don't want to because 90% of it's turkey.
[192:23.09]You understand?
[192:25.01]What about rice?
[192:26.91]Oh, uh... No, rice is probably... Okay, I'm gonna split this.
[192:32.59]This is getting split in half.
[192:36.50]Oh, no, it's gonna split in... Yeah, let's go like this.
[192:41.45]This is probably rice.
[192:45.95]Uh, what should rice be?
[192:48.53]Uh, let's just do, like, a dark... Like, here.
[192:50.83]I don't know.
[192:52.97]What's the color of the background?
[192:58.27]Shit.
[192:58.79]Um, what's a good... I need a better color for milk.
[193:06.68]God damn it.
[193:10.32]What the fuck are you doing?
[193:12.60]Stop.
[193:15.07]You're ruining everything.
[193:16.07]Okay.
[193:28.12]What color is pasta?
[193:31.24]I want to just do this one.
[193:32.14]Whatever.
[193:33.14]Okay, that's fine.
[193:33.86]Who cares?
[193:37.27]What was I doing?
[193:37.83]Oh yeah, I was splitting this into thirds.
[193:38.97]Because this is rice.
[193:40.13]Rice is right here.
[193:40.83]Do I eat more rice than mayonnaise?
[193:49.08]I mean, I don't know.
[193:51.18]I really don't know.
[193:55.35]Maybe.
[193:55.63]Maybe.
[194:07.49]You put mayo on rice.
[194:10.75]No, I don't.
[194:11.57]I just know I use it more often.
[194:13.11]Alright, rice is right there.
[194:15.51]Then... I definitely eat more.
[194:21.83]How do you consume that much mayonnaise?
[194:25.05]This is my weekly pyramid.
[194:26.37]This is not my daily pyramid.
[194:28.47]This is like my weekly... Fuck, that's a lot of mayonnaise.
[194:32.51]I'm trying to think about... Okay, when do I eat mayonnaise?
[194:38.56]In the morning.
[194:40.43]No.
[194:40.85]Where are eggs?
[194:42.03]Where are eggs?
[194:43.89]Eggs are up here.
[194:44.41]I eat eggs?
[194:50.69]I don't eat pork at all.
[194:51.83]I don't eat red meat either.
[194:54.46]Where does that go?
[194:55.00]Alright, it has to go above sugar.
[194:56.14]No, red meat fell off the fucking cliff.
[194:58.08]Okay.
[195:01.52]Red meat, I don't eat it.
[195:02.96]I don't eat it at all.
[195:07.08]Like, literally, I'm gonna throw, like, fucking throw lines like it fell off the goddamn mountain.
[195:22.39]Yeah.
[195:22.73]Like, sugar threw red meat and it buried it in the ocean.
[195:31.03]Okay.
[195:31.87]I don't need any red meat anymore.
[195:33.41]At all.
[195:33.97]What about steakums?
[195:34.75]Not anymore.
[195:35.45]That was just for a stream gag.
[195:38.56]Not anymore.
[195:39.14]We're going to do my other pyramid after this.
[195:41.41]I promise.
[195:43.79]I will show you what I used to eat like up until about like a year ago.
[195:50.53]I always have mayonnaise on the brain.
[195:51.51]The red meat thing was just a gag for the stream.
[195:53.08]I don't eat red meat.
[195:54.94]I shouted that out all the time.
[195:57.22]I said how much I loved it.
[195:58.88]I did, but not anymore.
[196:00.36]Okay, let's put eggs in here.
[196:12.57]Eggs.
[196:19.01]That makes sense to me.
[196:19.87]Although I really do wonder if this belongs here.
[196:26.62]I don't know if this belongs.
[196:27.54]I think it belongs above mayonnaise.
[196:30.20]But I don't eat eggs at every meal.
[196:31.48]I eat mayonnaise at every meal.
[196:33.57]Besides at breakfast.
[196:37.73]Is that true though?
[196:41.70]Alright, what about, um... Mayo is eggs.
[196:49.93]What about the legs?
[196:54.57]Eggs are dairy?
[196:57.03]Um... Uh, no, they are not.
[197:02.08]They are not dairy.
[197:03.06]Eggs are not dairy.
[197:04.18]I know that... No.
[197:05.58]What about Easy Bake Oven Meals?
[197:12.73]They are.
[197:13.47]Eggs are not dairy.
[197:14.45]They come from a chicken's ass.
[197:15.75]What are you talking about?
[197:17.85]Is a chicken a cow?
[197:21.47]Cows don't lay eggs.
[197:23.73]They do live birth.
[197:28.69]Yeah, it's not from a cow.
[197:29.80]It's not dairy.
[197:31.08]Dairy means milk-based.
[197:38.20]Prove it.
[197:39.38]Okay, you would like to go on a tour at a farm?
[197:48.24]And when you ask the farmer, hey, are eggs dairy?
[197:53.90]No, they're not.
[197:56.46]I thought you learned that in the third grade when you went with your class to the look at how old everything is exhibit on the field trip when you were like eight.
[198:08.69]And they were all the actors.
[198:12.63]And they all pretended to be from like the pilgrim times.
[198:17.96]You don't remember that apparently.
[198:25.51]What goes here though?
[198:26.47]What else do I eat?
[198:29.67]I definitely eat eggs more than... No, I don't.
[198:32.08]I think I do.
[198:33.44]I eat rice, eggs, and... What else?
[198:37.30]What about beans?
[198:37.84]There you go.
[198:38.30]Bingo.
[198:38.70]Yep.
[198:39.10]That's right.
[198:43.02]Why does this keep happening?
[198:44.65]I swear to god this thing has a mind of its own.
[198:47.17]Beans.
[198:48.50]Alright, there you go.
[198:49.68]There is my food pyramid.
[198:52.98]That is currently how I live my life at the moment.
[198:56.30]Mayonnaise may be below fruit.
[198:58.42]I may have overdone it a little.
[199:01.66]Onions and garlic are in there too, by the way.
[199:04.83]This is mayonnaise plus.
[199:05.71]This is mayonnaise, onions, and garlic.
[199:10.45]What about drinks?
[199:14.73]Okay, I'll make another drink pyramid.
[199:30.24]okay here's here is it here it is here is my drink pyramid the only two things that I consume as of I literally have been trying to switch to tea I don't that's it
[200:00.37]What about wine?
[200:01.63]Guys, I haven't drank in a very long time.
[200:07.83]Wine would be on here.
[200:10.10]But I have not drank alcohol in quite a while.
[200:14.60]It's been months.
[200:17.88]What about tea?
[200:18.40]Yeah, water and coffee.
[200:20.68]If I drink one coffee, it's a diuretic.
[200:23.22]I gotta be careful.
[200:24.94]Trying to go to black tea and green tea now.
[200:29.89]There you go.
[200:30.53]There it is.
[200:30.87]I made it.
[200:31.27]Now tell me what's wrong with this besides the mayonnaise plus.
[200:38.48]I don't eat any red meat.
[200:39.54]I don't eat any sugar.
[200:40.72]I milk and dairy.
[200:41.54]I don't eat very often.
[200:42.36]No bread really that.
[200:43.34]No fruits a little bit.
[200:45.14]Rice, eggs, and beans sometimes.
[200:46.90]Mayonnaise plus.
[200:48.03]Onions and garlic all the time.
[200:49.69]Greens.
[200:50.21]Radishes all the time.
[200:51.15]Nuts and seeds.
[200:52.29]Almonds.
[200:52.71]Peanut butter.
[200:53.59]Peanuts.
[200:54.55]Walnuts.
[200:56.21]Cashews, eh, not really.
[200:58.51]Throw those in the trash.
[200:59.67]Don't throw those in the trash.
[201:01.33]If you don't want them, donate them.
[201:02.89]Don't be an idiot.
[201:03.89]Fish, we're talking tuna, salmon.
[201:07.79]We're talking sushi.
[201:10.23]Yep, I love it.
[201:12.73]Turkey, poultry, chicken.
[201:15.26]We're talking chicken fingers.
[201:17.18]We're talking turkey patties.
[201:19.58]Turkey, ground turkey on top of, look at this.
[201:23.03]Check out this.
[201:23.63]I'll show you some fucking combos you can do with this pyramid.
[201:26.01]You got your turkey patty.
[201:27.91]Combo that on top of the rice.
[201:30.61]That's brown rice.
[201:31.97]Turkey.
[201:33.07]Just fucking sprinkle a little bit of spinach on there.
[201:35.11]There you go.
[201:37.27]Done.
[201:37.70]There's a full meal.
[201:38.98]You're ready.
[201:41.28]Don't eat any of this shit.
[201:43.20]I'm kidding.
[201:46.12]That's gross.
[201:48.26]What's gross about having like a turkey, like a nice pan-seared turkey patty on top of a thing of brown rice with some kale on top with some chopped mayonnaise plus on it?
[202:01.02]We're talking garlic.
[202:04.32]What's wrong with that?
[202:08.78]You put your mayo in your drinks.
[202:10.50]No, I don't put mayo in your drinks.
[202:11.82]Why would I do that?
[202:15.20]Here's another one for you.
[202:16.78]You got a nice, you toast up some, you got some nice toasted almonds.
[202:20.13]One.
[202:20.25]You have a nice, nice piece of salmon.
[202:24.33]Okay?
[202:25.07]Chop up those almonds.
[202:27.09]Throw that away.
[202:27.57]That's not a real recipe.
[202:28.35]I'm just trying to make up stuff.
[202:29.83]Alright, so you take the radishes.
[202:31.19]No, how do you do this?
[202:32.42]How do I eat fish?
[202:36.82]Alright, take... Hold on, I need to add something.
[202:40.52]I have to add something.
[202:41.16]Mayonnaise plus includes olive oil.
[202:44.63]I love olive oil.
[202:45.47]I eat it every fucking single day.
[202:47.37]Mayonnaise plus includes olive oil.
[202:53.81]Olive oil.
[202:54.78]Around here.
[202:55.56]Salmon.
[202:57.10]Put it in the pan.
[202:58.32]Salt.
[202:58.64]Pepper.
[202:58.90]Don't touch.
[202:59.36]Don't do anything else to it.
[203:00.40]Please, for the love of God.
[203:01.36]A little bit of olive oil.
[203:03.30]Just a little bit of salt and pepper.
[203:04.85]Don't touch it.
[203:06.07]Put it skin side down in the pan.
[203:07.85]Into the oven.
[203:08.27]450 degrees.
[203:10.61]It's 12 minutes.
[203:11.57]Take it out.
[203:11.97]Don't fucking touch it.
[203:12.75]Let it sit there for a second.
[203:13.57]It's going to be the best piece of salmon you've ever had in your whole life.
[203:16.43]Greens.
[203:18.19]Take some mayonnaise plus, which is take a little bit of olive oil, garlic.
[203:23.41]Only don't put any onions in there.
[203:25.13]Olive oil and garlic in a pan.
[203:26.20]Okay?
[203:28.88]Cook it down.
[203:29.94]Really toast it.
[203:30.58]Roast up that garlic in that pan.
[203:32.52]Take your greens.
[203:33.60]Grab some kale.
[203:35.04]Throw the greens in there when it's hot.
[203:37.20]Shake it around.
[203:37.68]10 seconds.
[203:38.78]Get that thing out of there.
[203:40.92]Lay it next to the salmon after it comes out.
[203:43.25]Bingo.
[203:43.67]You've got yourself a salmon and kale garlic dinner.
[203:51.68]Burn the garlic.
[203:52.42]That's not... I didn't burn the garlic.
[203:54.02]I got it nice and roasted.
[204:00.67]Yeah, sunflower seeds.
[204:01.97]Take a quarter pound of turkey.
[204:05.01]Dump sunflower seeds on it.
[204:06.83]Roast it, toast it, put it in the oven.
[204:09.43]125 degrees for 10 minutes.
[204:10.72]Dump mayonnaise on top of it when it comes out.
[204:13.20]Eat a bowl of rice while you wait.
[204:16.16]Didn't know about that little fucking secret snack, did you?
[204:19.20]Once that's done, pull it out of the oven.
[204:22.31]Squeeze lemon juice in your eyes.
[204:25.25]And throw flour in your face.
[204:29.47]And eat this as fast as you can.
[204:34.30]I've got a perfect pyramid.
[204:41.25]He's doing clown makeup.
[204:46.14]clown pyramid look okay that's this is it it really is it I don't eat red meat I don't eat that much sugar anymore I don't take in that much milk or dairy I don't mean okay let's do you want to see what it used to be years ago before like by years ago I mean like four years ago not that long ago let's do what it used to be this is what it is now ready for this doesn't go back that far fuck okay well whatever I'm just gonna erase it
[205:20.87]How would you erase yellow?
[205:22.01]That makes no sense.
[205:25.31]Why?
[205:25.67]Perfect, he says.
[205:26.31]You already took a screenshot.
[205:28.08]Just do the triangle tool.
[205:31.26]I like the setup already.
[205:34.90]I'm just going to do new.
[205:35.78]Whatever.
[205:37.76]What's the command keyboard to do a new product?
[205:41.14]Control what?
[205:42.73]I need to know this for later.
[205:47.66]Control N. Control W. File, new.
[205:50.66]I know what it is, but I want to get the real one.
[205:53.86]It's not Control W. It's Control N. No, I don't want to save.
[206:03.66]Okay.
[206:04.62]This is what it used to be.
[206:10.36]I am going to show you why you really need to take a look at your diet.
[206:14.74]It's really important shit.
[206:15.92]It really is.
[206:17.98]This is... I'm not going to pretend.
[206:19.68]I'm not going to lie.
[206:20.70]I'm not going to lie to you guys.
[206:21.53]This is going to be for real.
[206:24.37]No fucking around.
[206:26.65]This is... You're going to see right through me.
[206:28.19]Okay?
[206:30.81]I am going to go with... This is probably like about... Maybe like a year or two ago.
[206:34.85]Is this a shitty triangle?
[206:39.10]What's wrong with it?
[206:46.21]It's fine.
[206:46.69]What?
[206:48.35]That's fine.
[206:48.73]Okay, so down here, this is what I ate the most of.
[206:53.89]And it's embarrassing.
[206:56.82]It is.
[206:57.40]It actually is.
[206:58.48]It's more than that.
[207:03.24]This is what my... What do you think my number one source of food was for a long time?
[207:14.16]chicken yep what but very specific not not I know no no fried chicken whether that's chicken sandwich whether that's chicken strips whether that's just chicken that's been fried it like just fried up chicken
[207:38.58]I'm not kidding.
[207:39.96]Maybe this is not a year ago.
[207:40.84]Maybe this is probably like three or four years ago.
[207:43.04]But it used to be like this.
[207:47.24]This is not a joke.
[207:53.86]Spaghetti?
[207:54.70]That's pasta.
[207:56.64]Don't worry.
[207:57.28]It's coming right next to that.
[208:01.03]Alright, well, fried chicken is gonna be... Yeah, that makes sense.
[208:03.98]Gotta be bigger than that, too.
[208:06.36]Let's do, like, I don't know, a hundred.
[208:08.60]And it's gone.
[208:13.10]Okay, cool.
[208:13.30]Where did the... What is he... What are you doing?
[208:22.69]Where's my cursor?
[208:28.95]Whatever, that's fine.
[208:30.73]Fried chicken.
[208:31.95]Fuck.
[208:32.53]Mom, don't watch.
[208:35.33]She's gonna be like, what?
[208:38.39]I raised him on a mayonnaise diet.
[208:40.07]Why is he doing this?
[208:52.70]And I'm gonna clarify underneath because people are gonna be like, what the fuck is he talking about?
[208:55.50]I'm gonna clarify.
[208:57.94]This is like
[209:00.80]sandwiches why just write it it's so much faster sandwiches strips this is uh nuggets this is uh yeah yeah
[209:30.08]That's chicken sandwiches, chicken strips, chicken nuggets.
[209:34.45]Oh man, I want it right now.
[209:36.51]But no, not part of my current pyramid.
[209:39.87]Can't be included.
[209:41.67]Coming up next we have, what do you think?
[209:49.29]This is bread and pasta.
[210:03.41]Bread, pasta, flour.
[210:05.50]Okay?
[210:10.00]Bread, pasta, flour.
[210:12.52]Because the flour and the bread on the chicken makes fried chicken.
[210:18.73]And I've had a lot of it.
[210:19.71]I've had it all the time.
[210:21.97]No, no, no.
[210:22.47]Flour like flour tortillas.
[210:24.03]Flour like white flour.
[210:25.51]Wheat flour.
[210:25.97]Like, I'm talking, like, it's in everything.
[210:27.80]I used to eat a ton of it.
[210:34.29]Man, this sucks looking at this.
[210:35.37]Okay, now, after this... Okay, um... After that, it's probably... Probably, like, ground beef.
[210:48.67]Like, meat.
[210:51.77]Yeah, it's, like, specifically ground beef.
[210:57.75]Just, like, red meat.
[211:04.05]It's not good.
[211:04.63]It's too much.
[211:07.39]Look at how sad this looks too.
[211:11.05]Where's all the color?
[211:16.70]This diet isn't bad though.
[211:18.16]Okay.
[211:21.44]I really need you to think if consuming fried chicken as a majority of your diet is a good idea.
[211:29.07]You have to think about that.
[211:38.10]Here's the worst part about this.
[211:39.40]If you put a plate of perfect fried chicken in front of me right now, I would break everything and just eat it.
[211:45.42]Because I would be like, I don't care.
[211:46.58]I love this so much.
[211:47.44]I don't even give a shit.
[211:48.52]I don't care.
[211:49.12]Give it to me.
[211:53.51]Okay, above that, we're gonna do... Okay, so... Probably onions.
[212:01.15]Like, specifically onions.
[212:04.39]Would do a vegetable one, but I can't even do a green one So we're gonna have to do like a puke one because it was onions only Okay onions
[212:36.83]No!
[212:37.39]I want to pick it up.
[212:39.17]Whatever.
[212:42.73]What are steakums?
[212:45.55]They fit in here.
[212:46.19]Right there.
[212:51.25]Lavender's not a pew color.
[212:52.37]Well, I already used a pew color, didn't I?
[212:53.73]Oh, no, I didn't.
[212:55.87]But that looks good.
[212:57.09]Onions are like this.
[212:58.01]Yeah, that's a good onions color.
[213:02.02]Alright.
[213:02.40]And then after that...
[213:07.05]Yeah, I know it's like a gray, but the background is gray.
[213:13.54]What do you want me to do?
[213:14.52]Look, I'm ruining everything.
[213:24.14]I've got to use white for milk.
[213:31.76]Because that's right here.
[213:38.57]How big is it though?
[213:41.03]Yeah, it's pretty big.
[213:44.23]Weird.
[213:44.53]You know what's really funny about this diet?
[213:46.91]That we'll talk about in a minute.
[213:48.10]And this is just the total just liar hypocrisy dog shit that a lot of us have a problem with.
[213:55.16]And I'm guilty of it too.
[213:57.90]I'll tell you in a second.
[214:01.19]So up here is... I'm going to put it in the same spot.
[214:06.15]Right there.
[214:07.43]There it is.
[214:09.33]This is sugar, sweets, and candy.
[214:12.35]And I remember telling everybody and telling friends and family, like, oh, do you want, like, to get dessert?
[214:16.78]No, no, no, no.
[214:17.84]Of course not.
[214:18.88]I mean, sugar kills you.
[214:20.04]Sugar's so, like, bad for you.
[214:22.10]You're taking in sugar?
[214:24.80]No, not me.
[214:25.64]You see, not me.
[214:26.32]Not this guy.
[214:27.06]Not me.
[214:29.30]And little do I know on my own that I was eating, like, pasta and, like, red meat and sauce and onions and fried chicken sandwiches.
[214:40.80]34 times a week.
[214:45.73]No, no, I don't drink soda.
[214:47.31]Hey, Jeremy, would you like a soda?
[214:50.83]Okay.
[214:51.81]Would I like a... Did you hear what he's saying?
[214:54.65]This guy's saying this?
[214:55.77]Would I like a soda?
[214:56.77]Okay, are you disgusting?
[214:58.65]You know that like, that's like, that like rots your teeth and stuff.
[215:01.35]And it's like, it's like smoking a cigarette every time you drink a soda.
[215:04.57]Okay, this guy wants a soda.
[215:05.89]No, I'll take a lemon with, I'll take a water with lemon, please.
[215:09.19]You fucking idiot.
[215:12.75]What's your entree gonna be?
[215:13.85]I'll have flour, bread, pasta, and meat fried inside of the thing that has a bunch of fucking oil in it.
[215:22.97]Okay.
[215:23.95]Yum.
[215:31.56]Are you disgusting?
[215:33.22]Yes.
[215:33.76]Look.
[215:34.24]That's all you need to see.
[215:35.50]Alright, so this is milk.
[215:38.38]Dairy.
[215:38.50]Dairy.
[215:40.62]Actually, you know what?
[215:41.14]Eggs probably... No, this is dairy.
[215:46.88]There's your dairy.
[215:48.14]I got it.
[215:49.78]Okay, yeah.
[215:50.36]I definitely ate more onions than dairy.
[215:57.52]Wait, I didn't put sugar up here.
[216:01.93]Did I write it?
[216:08.07]You can't even see that, but whatever.
[216:09.37]It doesn't matter.
[216:18.88]You're making us sad?
[216:20.54]Why?
[216:20.74]Is this all your diets?
[216:23.84]Is this what you guys used to eat?
[216:26.58]Do you eat this now?
[216:28.72]You were just like me.
[216:29.32]You were just like me until I found... Until I got on Team Turkey.
[216:34.61]And Team Nuts.
[216:39.47]Join me.
[216:41.07]Join the turkey eaters.
[216:42.85]The nut eaters.
[216:44.11]The peanut butter eaters.
[216:45.76]The... The... The tuna fish eaters.
[216:48.68]The salmon eaters.
[216:49.72]Join us!
[216:54.72]Don't eat this stuff that often.
[216:56.12]It's not good for you.
[216:56.92]It's not as bad.
[216:57.72]Alright, after dairy we got... I did eat vegetables.
[217:03.65]I wasn't like a total fucking psycho.
[217:07.11]I did.
[217:07.43]I did.
[217:09.52]But I ate a lot of yogurt.
[217:11.18]And I thought that was really healthy of me.
[217:14.96]I would eat one just unsweetened Greek yogurt and thought I was a god for the rest of the day.
[217:25.45]Turkey shrinks your dick.
[217:27.53]Well, that would be weird.
[217:36.87]It does not!
[217:37.95]Oh my god.
[217:40.88]Turkey doesn't shrink your dick.
[217:44.56]That's absurd.
[217:45.64]That's insane.
[217:46.26]And I refuse to even acknowledge that that's a real opinion.
[217:50.49]So we're going to move on.
[217:51.33]We prove it.
[217:52.05]Look it up.
[217:54.63]I don't want the last thing in my search history to be, does Turkey shrink your dick?
[217:58.59]I have a feeling I'll forget about that one.
[218:01.83]And someone will use this computer and be like, okay, something's going on with this dude.
[218:09.96]I did eat vegetables.
[218:10.82]I really did.
[218:13.42]I still was a big fan of green vegetables.
[218:16.35]Even though this is like the end of the pyramid.
[218:19.25]You know, I'm going to at least do myself a favor.
[218:21.39]I'm going to put this... This belongs.
[218:26.93]Onions, get them.
[218:27.91]I mean, who eats just onions?
[218:29.33]I mean, I did eat a lot of them, but still.
[218:36.30]Holy shit, it actually shrinks your dick.
[218:39.62]Shut the fuck up.
[218:42.58]I refu- I'm not gonna believe it.
[218:47.13]Turkey does not shrink your dick.
[218:48.73]I'm not even gonna look it up.
[218:54.95]The final thing would be like condiments.
[218:59.60]We'll do this.
[219:03.74]This- look at this diet.
[219:05.54]You wanna know the sad part about this diet?
[219:09.90]Okay, screenshot this in a second.
[219:12.86]Because this is actually really bad.
[219:20.14]This is like oil.
[219:21.14]Oil and condiments.
[219:28.28]That's pretty much my diet, what it was.
[219:35.28]So essentially this...
[219:38.30]Leveled up and knocked out all these other ones and got down to here.

[220:24.73]That's all I'm, that's all, I'm not going to say any more words.
[220:30.81]I didn't say any more words.
[220:31.91]I said, do you guys know a turkey's neck?
[220:34.45]It's like, oh, I know what the turkey's neck is.
[220:36.65]Yes, I'm done talking.
[220:38.13]I'm not, why do I need to continue to speak?

[221:12.96]Why did you say that?
[221:13.82]What do you mean why did I say that?
[221:15.27]Why did you type that?
[221:16.17]Why did a thousand of you?
[221:17.79]Why did a thousand of you type that?
[221:20.73]Is it bad that I said it or is it bad that over a thousand of you wrote it first?
[221:28.87]Alright, there you go.
[221:29.53]There's my food pyramids.
[221:34.77]I hope you enjoyed it.
[221:38.27]But here's the sad thing.
[221:40.09]I'm gonna show you something.
[221:42.49]Because this is actually bad and it's... I was thinking this as I was making this pyramid.
[221:47.95]Let's look at the actual food pyramid.
[221:49.65]The one that everyone thought was the good one for like five decades.
[221:57.34]It is not that different to the one I just showed you.
[222:02.61]Food pyramid.
[222:06.21]Here it is.
[222:06.69]Okay.
[222:07.19]Healthy food pyramid.
[222:16.43]It's all bread.
[222:17.49]Okay, it's a bunch of bread and vegetables and fruits and then milk.
[222:28.00]Let's see how different mine... This is so coolly made, too.
[222:30.44]Look at this.
[222:31.74]Log in to see more.
[222:33.10]Oh my god.
[222:34.47]Don't give me that fucking bullshit.
[222:37.97]I can't even get away from this website.
[222:40.23]It just linked me to Pinterest and now I'm trapped on Pinterest and it's begging me to make an account.
[222:46.28]Okay, here we go.
[222:52.36]Save image as... Here's the original USDA image.
[223:10.83]USDA.
[223:11.87]Okay.
[223:13.98]Let's go over this real quick.
[223:19.50]This is what you were supposed to eat.
[223:24.00]You got bread.
[223:24.96]Bread, cereal, rice, pasta.
[223:28.16]This was 40% of your entire diet.
[223:34.52]That was my diet.
[223:38.43]Although vegetables were not up here and neither were fruits.
[223:41.33]This came down here.
[223:44.85]milk yogurt cheese meat poultry it was a bunch of bread and corn this makes me want to puke is there no there's no turkey inside here but I mean they do have peanut butter I will give them that although this belongs here mayo is at the top
[224:24.41]Mayo is apparently worse than cookies, candy, and chips.
[224:29.73]It's the worst thing in the history of eating.
[224:33.09]You're not supposed to eat it.
[224:35.85]You're supposed to have mayo less than you have cookies.
[224:39.35]Now imagine if I ate like 30 cookies a day.
[224:43.82]Worse than sugar.
[224:44.78]That's not even accurate.
[224:47.78]oil's good for you this is old this is back when they this is back when the cavemen were trading teeth with each other alright this is not even a real good list this thing you want bread you want to eat loaves of bread every day you want all of your food to come from bread oh yeah this is pretty good diet 40 percent of donuts bread pasta and cereal and some tacos
[225:17.09]They didn't know shit about mayonnaise.
[225:18.31]They didn't understand.
[225:18.91]They didn't know anything.
[225:20.61]They didn't know that it had this fucking polyunsaturated fat in it.
[225:24.79]Yeah, that's a big word.
[225:25.95]I know it.
[225:26.29]They didn't know anything about peanut butter.
[225:31.95]They're having all like the good fats.
[225:33.76]Fat was bad back in the day, guys.
[225:35.54]Back then, fat was bad.
[225:36.88]All fat was bad.
[225:38.40]But new science has put mayonnaise way back, way down to here because it's a healthy fat.
[225:48.22]There's been so much more science on fat.
[225:50.10]That's why peanut butter, everybody loves it.
[225:51.56]It's so good for you.
[225:52.32]Olive oil.
[225:53.20]Mayonnaise.
[225:55.20]Mayonnaise.
[225:55.82]Good, real mayonnaise.
[225:56.92]It's healthy.
[225:58.34]Marshmallows.
[225:59.60]Marshmallow fluff is like zero.
[226:01.08]It's like 12 calories.
[226:02.32]I didn't know this shit back in the day.
[226:08.50]No, it's not.
[226:12.28]It's not?
[226:14.01]Hold on.
[226:15.27]Is mayonnaise good for you?
[226:18.88]Real mayonnaise.
[226:22.78]Here we go.
[226:23.80]This is from verywellfit.com.
[226:27.42]You think there's a website that doesn't tell you what is good and fit for your fucking body?
[226:32.16]You don't think it's that website?
[226:34.44]Get out of here.
[226:36.52]Depending on the type of diet you follow, mayo can be considered good or bad for you.
[226:40.73]Okay, well, I gotta read the whole article.
[226:43.75]I'm also gonna read the fucking Reddit thread and make my opinion on it.
[226:46.07]The Reddit, like, the title.
[226:49.35]It's Mayna- Hey, hey, hey.
[226:52.65]Americans seem to have a love-hate relationship with mayonnaise.
[226:55.90]It is the best-selling condiment in North America.
[226:57.96]Thank you.
[226:59.04]And it is a lot popular.
[227:00.32]And it is in a lot of popular American foods.
[227:03.76]From sandwiches.
[227:04.48]Thank you.
[227:05.20]Tuna salad.
[227:06.04]Love it.
[227:06.70]Deviled eggs.
[227:07.60]Egg salad.
[227:08.40]Oh.
[227:08.88]Tartar sauce.
[227:09.81]Love it.
[227:10.43]Part of my fish diet.
[227:12.89]But mayonnaise has seemed to have acquired a bad reputation.
[227:16.97]Maybe it's from a bunch of fucking internet dickheads that talk about how mayonnaise is fat instead of... Oh, and I don't like it because it's, like, white and gross.
[227:25.70]A high-fat food, mayonnaise is often thought to be unhealthy.
[227:30.68]It is mostly fat, and as a result, it's calorie-dense.
[227:33.44]In case, you know, you gotta put some weight on if you want.
[227:36.59]It's easy for calories and fat to quickly add up when you're not paying attention to portion sizes.
[227:43.82]Maybe you just shouldn't eat the whole can.
[227:46.28]In addition, some people steer clear of the popular condiment due to concerns that improperly stored mayonnaise would be hotbed for bacteria.
[227:52.04]Store it correctly.
[227:52.72]Thank you, VeryWellFit.com.
[227:56.51]The safety of potato salad left outdoors during a Fourth of July barbecue or a tuna salad sandwich from a food truck may be questionable.
[228:03.13]What?
[228:03.31]Is that real?
[228:11.95]Is that actually a real thing?
[228:14.55]The truth is, with careful selection, proper preparation and storage, and moderate use, mayonnaise can be a delicious and healthy addition to a low-carb diet.
[228:22.98]Thank you.
[228:23.44]Okay, now let's get to the real meat here.
[228:29.44]Depending on the type of diet you follow, mayo can be considered good or bad for you.
[228:34.05]Mayonnaise is mostly oil, so it is a high-fat and calorie-dense condiment with 100 calories per tablespoon.
[228:40.01]That's a lot.
[228:41.58]If you're on a low-fat or low-calorie diet, you want to exercise portion control and measure out the amount of mayo you use.
[228:47.31]For people on a low-carb or ketogenic diet, mayonnaise can be endured more liberally.
[228:52.93]While mayo is made almost entirely of fat, it mostly is unsaturated fat, which is a healthier fat.
[229:00.63]Okay, this is how I determine how much mayonnaise I'm using.
[229:05.52]So when I make tuna salad, it's one of my favorite things since I was a toddler.
[229:11.00]Since I was like seven years old.
[229:13.06]You take a nice, good can of tuna fish.
[229:15.88]Good one.
[229:16.70]Sustainable.
[229:19.30]Get a sustainable, good sustainable tuna brand.
[229:22.39]Open it up.
[229:24.75]No.
[229:25.35]What do you mean no?
[229:25.83]No.
[229:28.01]Put it in a bowl, mush it up with your fork, Ster it around, and then put a bunch of mayonnaise in there until it becomes a paste.
[229:38.98]Is that too much?
[229:40.16]I don't know.
[229:41.06]Is it too little?
[229:41.86]I don't know.
[229:46.72]But it becomes a like tuna paste.
[229:50.36]It's not thin.
[229:51.20]It's not like too much mayonnaise.
[229:52.44]It's just like enough to keep it all together.
[229:57.71]It was one time where... Okay, this is an incoming disgusting statement.
[230:02.76]I hope you all know.
[230:03.84]But we're talking about how gross this pyramid is that we're looking at.
[230:06.54]Anyways.
[230:08.02]One time, I was really hungry.
[230:10.59]And I did a big thing of tuna just right out of the can.
[230:13.19]Put it in there.
[230:13.75]Okay, I'm ready for the mayonnaise.
[230:15.85]And I just... My eyes went... I saw red.
[230:18.61]I don't know why.
[230:20.95]And I took a big tablespoon of the mayonnaise, and I was like, alright, there's one.
[230:23.90]I'm gonna do another one, that's not enough.
[230:26.40]I did another full fucking huge tablespoon of mayonnaise, and I started to Ster it up.
[230:31.14]And I went, boom, boom, boom, boom, okay, and it's looking a little, that looks fine.
[230:35.08]Not enough.
[230:36.38]And I did a third, gigantic, disgusting slop of mayonnaise into it.
[230:41.20]And there was probably more mayonnaise than tuna in this.
[230:43.65]And I immediately regretted my mistake.
[230:47.42]I took a bite of it, just to check, because I didn't want to waste it or anything.
[230:51.31]And it was... And I ate it.
[230:52.79]I ate the whole thing.
[230:55.35]I ate the whole thing.
[231:03.44]He still ate it.
[231:04.78]That's not moderate.
[231:05.74]No, but that's alright, though.
[231:07.04]Because, listen, why the oil matters is important.
[231:09.91]The good news is that almost any edible oil can be used to make mayonnaise.
[231:14.03]But get all that other shit out of here.
[231:15.75]I want it with good, 100%, straight from Italy, olive oil.
[231:20.31]That's how I make mine.
[231:22.43]You can make your own mayonnaise cheaper.
[231:25.65]The oil itself is the biggest factor in the healthfulness of the recipe.
[231:30.75]In the United States, most commercial mayonnaise is made with soy oil.
[231:34.09]Pfft.
[231:36.06]Yuck.
[231:37.24]That's problematic, dude, with high levels of omega-6.
[231:39.82]Get that out of here.
[231:40.60]No, you want the real, the good stuff.
[231:44.36]The best-selling commercial mayonnaise in the U.S.
[231:46.02]is Hellman's brand in the East and Best Foods in the West.
[231:50.54]Those companies sell mayo made from soy oil in the U.S.
[231:54.27]and canola oil in Canada.
[231:55.75]Canola oil has a lower omega-6 content than soy oil.
[231:59.79]Nope.
[232:00.59]No, no, no.
[232:03.06]If you make the mayonnaise yourself, you can use any kind of oil, including olive or avocado oil.
[232:09.95]Uh-huh.
[232:10.33]What did I just tell you?
[232:12.79]You get a... And plus, this is... I don't know how when this article is made, but a lot of... A lot of mayonnaises that you buy at a good store, at a grocery store, have olive oil.
[232:26.62]If I turn it and it says soy oil, I turn it around immediately and I put it back.
[232:30.84]I put it immediately back on the shelf.
[232:34.29]But I don't need to do that anymore because I know exactly what I like in my brand.
[232:38.24]I either make it myself.
[232:40.32]I've never made mayonnaise of my own by myself ever.
[232:43.30]It's just a way to make the streamer, make the audience think that he's way more talented and smarter than he is.
[232:48.46]When in reality, it was all made up from the very beginning.
[232:52.93]I've never made my own mayonnaise ever.
[232:54.33]I buy a good brand.
[232:58.23]Anyways.
[233:00.19]You get it.
[233:04.71]It's olive oil.
[233:06.01]Olive oil and eggs.
[233:11.91]Listen, man.
[233:12.37]You aren't healthy.
[233:16.11]Little mayonnaise.
[233:18.83]Almonds is the best.
[233:23.18]I don't... I wish I could agree with you there.
[233:24.78]Ant.
[233:27.08]Ant.
[233:30.55]I cannot agree with you.
[233:31.49]I'm gonna have to go with 365's original organic mayonnaise.
[233:35.38]I'm sorry.
[233:37.90]You lost out on that one.
[233:41.50]It's smooth.
[233:43.10]It's fucking creamy.
[233:44.26]It's perfect.
[233:45.61]It's thick enough you can get it right on a sandwich.
[233:49.85]Oh, yeah.
[233:53.01]Do a mayonnaise ASMR.
[234:03.23]You make me sick.
[234:04.69]Wait, there's one thing.
[234:05.45]365 is my favorite store brand.
[234:10.43]It's not olive oil.
[234:11.35]It's canola oil.
[234:13.65]Just so everybody doesn't freak out.
[234:15.04]He said he doesn't like it.
[234:16.56]I said soy oil I don't want.
[234:18.72]Olive oil and canola is fine.
[234:23.82]It's a bougie rich... You're a bougie rich bitch.
[234:27.85]Alright, time that guy over 10 seconds.
[234:29.97]At least.
[234:39.67]Why?
[234:40.37]Because I buy like 365 ma- Wait, I did say 365 for something else, too.
[234:45.91]Today.
[234:47.93]What was it?
[234:54.44]What did I say?
[234:55.38]Peanut butter.
[234:56.10]Oh, shit.
[234:58.44]Oh, now you guys know where I like to shop for my, like, peanut butter.
[235:01.88]Uh-oh.
[235:05.11]He likes the stuff at Whole Foods.
[235:16.26]Look, I, okay, listen.
[235:18.26]I like, I go, I just, I don't just go to Whole Foods every fucking day, okay?
[235:22.66]I buy my shelf-stable stuff from Whole Foods because I like it better.
[235:27.28]I think it's a higher quality.
[235:28.26]It is.
[235:28.90]The peanut butter, mayonnaise, uh, like, tuna, condiments, it's all better from Whole Foods.
[235:34.46]I'm sorry, it is.
[235:35.06]I'm just telling, I'm just telling you, it is.
[235:36.18]It just is.
[235:36.84]I'm sorry.
[235:37.32]That's it.
[235:37.58]That's true.
[235:37.97]That's real.
[235:39.09]That's for real.
[235:42.34]It's not just, like, a hundred rows of, like, Heinz tomato ketchup.
[235:47.10]There's, like, a bunch of different ketchups that buy a bunch of different, like, local companies or brands or, or healthier.
[235:53.32]He's a capitalist.
[236:01.73]I just don't want, I don't want Hellman's.
[236:03.55]And they have Hellman's, and, okay, they have Hellman's and grocery store brand.
[236:08.95]And I don't, I don't want to buy a grocery store brand.
[236:14.01]I'll eat... I want Hellman's instead of grocery store brand.
[236:18.01]Is he still on this?
[236:19.00]Holy... It's been a long time.
[236:25.20]What about... What about the... Somebody said it.
[236:27.34]That mayonnaise is fucking incredible.
[236:31.16]What is it?
[236:32.95]Kewpie pie.
[236:34.09]Yep.
[236:35.25]Kewpie mayonnaise is insane.
[236:37.47]It's a Japanese mayonnaise.
[236:39.47]It's the best mayonnaise I've ever had in my life.
[236:41.77]Kewpie...
[236:43.77]Mayonnaise.
[236:50.55]Kewpie pie.
[236:52.83]Kewpie pie.
[236:54.00]I don't know why the pie was in there.
[236:57.54]Somebody said pie at the end of it.
[236:58.78]That's why I said it.
[237:00.46]But Kewpie is incredible.
[237:01.74]It's the best mayo ever.
[237:06.04]It's a Japanese mayo.
[237:07.64]And holy shit.
[237:09.46]It's almost like a handcrafted delicious thing I've ever had in my life.
[237:15.76]That R365 is good, too.
[237:17.38]It's good.
[237:18.39]365 anything is good.
[237:20.33]If you open up my fridge, or you open up my fucking... Look in my, like, pantry or whatever.
[237:24.61]You open up, like, any of my storage for food.
[237:27.23]You're gonna see the number 365 a thousand times.
[237:31.16]Xbox 365.
[237:32.46]Right.
[237:32.66]Just write a 5 in front of it.
[237:39.56]I'll wait.
[237:40.08]I'll try it out.
[237:41.74]You're still gross for all your mayo consuming.
[237:45.76]And that's gross.
[237:47.24]It's gross to like mayonnaise.
[237:49.34]I know.
[237:49.80]I get it.
[237:54.01]But... Just one day when none of your friends are looking.
[238:00.49]If they have mayonnaise at the counter, whatever, even if you, it doesn't matter.
[238:02.91]If you're at, like, McDonald's, it doesn't matter where the fuck you are.
[238:05.51]Just take your french fries and just tell, like, hey, guys, I guess I have to go to the bathroom.
[238:10.67]Like, I really have to go to the bathroom.
[238:11.83]Don't all four of you have to go to the bathroom?
[238:14.46]Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm going to fish.
[238:15.22]Yeah, that's right.
[238:17.92]They all leave, and then you can sit down, you can open up the mayonnaise, pack it, dunk your french fry in the mayonnaise enough where you could- not like a little tiny little pin, no.
[238:28.05]Go in there and get it, and take a bite with french fries.
[238:31.89]Nobody even has to see you doing it.
[238:35.65]And then either say, wow, that was horrible, and nobody cares, and nobody sees it, or go, holy shit, I literally just ate the mayonnaise, and it was delicious.
[238:48.31]It's the worst.
[238:48.95]No.
[238:49.29]I'm telling you.
[238:51.15]Where are my English friends here?
[238:54.81]Where are my English friends here?
[238:56.07]I know there's at least a few of these.
[238:58.07]Two people at least have to be from Britain.
[239:00.95]Europe.
[239:02.21]Somebody from Europe.
[239:02.95]Please.
[239:03.71]Bail me out here.
[239:08.89]Mayonnaise and french fries.
[239:09.75]Come on.
[239:10.11]Bail me out here.
[239:10.91]Where are my... That's a Quebec thing.
[239:14.69]Where are all my Quebec friends?
[239:22.18]We're all like Canadians.
[239:25.78]Come on.
[239:26.28]You guys do like the gravy and cheese thing.
[239:27.98]You do poutine.
[239:28.76]You guys like the mayonnaise on there too, don't you?
[239:30.68]Yeah, guys.
[239:35.16]You got to expand your horizons.
[239:41.55]Is William... Did you say Defoe?
[239:44.63]They love mayonnaise in Germany.
[239:47.19]Good.
[239:49.45]Good.
[239:50.94]Cheese and gravy.
[239:51.60]Yeah, that's awesome.
[239:54.24]I'm Canadian and I like mayo and fries.
[239:55.80]You're right.
[239:56.22]Thank you.
[239:56.54]I'm not.
[240:01.44]Belgians love it.
[240:04.08]Germans are insane.
[240:05.38]No.
[240:05.60]What are you talking about?
[240:08.16]Nobody said that.
[240:11.18]Alright.
[240:12.20]We're done.
[240:12.72]We did it.
[240:13.82]That was about a full hour of absolutely nothing.
[240:21.50]I don't think I've ever burned an hour like that before.
[240:24.32]And I don't think I stopped talking.
[240:28.13]I feel like those people that go to the local town hall meetings and they get up there with a big presentation like an old science fair thing behind them with the boards with pictures on it like they're fucking 11.
[240:43.68]I just did one of those.
[240:46.34]I just did a science fair presentation to you guys.
[240:49.74]I just wouldn't stop talking.
[240:51.02]And even when people told me, like, that's your time.
[240:52.52]And I just keep talking.
[240:53.70]Until somebody, like, removes me.
[241:00.86]Mayo filibuster.
[241:02.06]Pog.
[241:08.44]Okay.
[241:10.82]Shall we go back to playing the video game?
[241:17.39]I don't even know what the hell is going on.
[241:19.90]No, that's it.
[241:20.75]It's just the stream.
[241:21.33]Just end.
[241:24.53]I mean, it's been four hours.
[241:25.79]I'm only going to go for probably another hour.
[241:27.19]This is the end of the stream.
[241:34.07]Now, what are we doing tomorrow?
[241:35.35]Tomorrow might be viewer's choice, I think.
[241:37.67]I have a lot of things you can choose from.
[241:41.16]We got GameCube.
[241:51.63]This is going to be sad, but that took so long I forget how to play the game.
[241:56.67]It was an hour of mayo discourse.
[242:18.75]I mean, if I get that passionate about mayonnaise... If I ever became a politician... Holy shit.
[242:22.29]I think I would be unstoppable.
[242:45.24]If I just did a one hour full talking like mayonnaise rant, I could just be one of those guys that just, I could be one of those old guys that, hey, I want to be noticed by the speaker if I could have the speaker's attention here.
[242:59.13]And you just talk.
[243:00.53]You could be talking about mayonnaise for like an hour straight with like papers in your hand.
[243:03.74]You just shuffle them sometimes.
[243:04.68]And the thing about that mayonnaise is only soybean oil
[243:11.36]Should be allowed in that mayonnaise.
[243:13.56]I'm just saying, I think that's the most delicious kind.
[243:17.75]And my friend, my friend from across the aisle, my friend, they always call him my friend.
[243:21.33]You're not friends.
[243:22.85]You guys hate each other.
[243:24.41]Stop saying that.
[243:24.93]You're doing that like to like be in jest and kind of annoying.
[243:28.75]Oh, you see my friend from across the aisle and now he's like, I'm not your friend.
[243:32.74]Like, fuck you.
[243:33.24]Now I'm not going to sign that bill.
[243:35.31]I just can't understand why my friends from across the aisle over there won't put their name on that bill.
[243:40.94]It's like, no, I'm not going to put it on now.
[243:42.44]Not putting it on.
[243:43.06]I'm not your friend.
[243:43.64]You're a fucking asshole.
[243:44.34]Not putting it on.
[243:47.52]And everybody does that.
[243:48.48]All of them do it.
[243:50.20]Well, you know, our friends from across, you know, they always like put like quotes in sometimes too.
[243:54.04]Or does it play the fucking game?
[244:00.63]Sorry in advance, darling.
[244:03.41]Don't they know who I am?
[244:10.93]Wedding gown!
[244:42.40]Fuck are you?
[244:43.18]Aren't you at my wedding?
[244:45.22]Aren't you like security at the wedding?
[244:47.00]I'm the bride, motherfucker.
[244:48.52]Holy shit.
[244:53.79]Right.
[245:09.65]Wait, is this not a husband and wife?
[245:11.27]I thought this was like photos for a wedding.
[245:13.96]I just grabbed this guy.
[245:14.66]I need him.
[245:15.02]Here's the photographer.
[245:15.86]Okay.
[245:38.41]I did not like that photo!
[245:41.01]Delete it!
[245:41.69]I need more time.
[245:42.99]Try to distract Frank.
[245:44.95]I really need to check the flower.
[245:46.51]And on my registry!
[245:48.96]Buy the mixer!
[245:51.58]Bye for now.
[245:55.18]Finally.
[245:55.84]Game's too low?
[245:56.56]I'll never leave.
[245:57.38]Need to work fast.
[246:00.86]Get what I need and leave before I get dragged to the altar.
[246:05.18]Fucking delete.
[246:05.98]Delete what?
[246:06.54]I need a key to the upper floor.
[246:08.85]I think she carries a spare.
[246:11.91]This is low.
[246:12.23]You're right.
[246:12.67]Here we go.
[246:12.97]I bet she won't mind if I borrow it for a spell.
[246:16.67]Delete this game.
[246:17.17]Why?
[246:17.45]The guards won't bother me so long as I don't misbehave too much.
[246:20.04]I gotta pay attention.
[246:20.76]Don't misbehave.
[246:21.94]That's it.
[246:22.34]Just walk around.
[246:22.90]I'm the bride.
[246:24.16]As soon as I get it, I'll sneak in through the library door.
[246:27.68]The upper floor is off limits.
[246:29.44]I'll have to avoid the guards until I reach the office.
[246:32.76]Bodwasher's mayo turkey dick rant is over.
[246:35.06]You can skip now.
[246:36.40]No.
[246:37.02]Stay.
[246:38.22]Stay.
[246:38.58]And don't leave.
[246:39.23]Fuck are you?
[246:40.33]I can't get over that.
[246:41.29]Fuck are you?
[246:41.91]Fuck.
[246:42.13]I need the small... I need the... Okay.
[246:43.69]Get in through the library door.
[246:46.11]You'll need a key.
[247:02.36]I have to give him one thing.
[247:03.94]The dress is beautiful.
[247:08.66]I object this, Union.
[247:09.82]Am I not allowed to go up here?
[247:21.98]No, this is like my house.
[247:24.92]I doubt I could climb that.
[247:26.24]Why would I need to climb the vines in my own estate?
[247:29.40]Quick, before he comes back.
[247:33.15]Holy shit.
[247:37.23]I'm ruining it.
[247:39.21]What am I ruining?
[247:48.88]What happened?
[247:54.04]I'm looking it up once and for all.
[247:55.34]I'm looking it up once and for all.
[247:57.28]I'm going to have to clear my browser history.
[247:59.04]Does turkey shrink your...
[248:04.47]Eating chicken may lead to a smaller penis.
[248:10.06]Okay.
[248:11.72]You have one article from 2011.
[248:13.10]That's on a website called Nutrition Facts.
[248:20.13]I don't know.
[248:20.79]Is this a fact?
[248:23.11]Can your penis shrink?
[248:24.23]Can your penis shrink?
[248:25.65]Dirty foods that surprising causes a permanent penis shrinking.
[248:30.36]What?
[248:30.52]What?
[248:35.74]No.
[248:37.66]No.
[248:37.96]There's only one article.
[248:42.64]There's proof.
[248:43.36]Permanent.
[248:43.92]Let me see.
[248:46.36]Eating chicken.
[248:47.06]Okay, don't click this.
[248:50.00]Yeah, according to available science, three quarters of women find... Yeah, okay.
[248:53.52]Sure, sure, sure.
[248:54.08]They find... Whatever.
[248:55.76]What does this have to do with the diet?
[248:57.50]Flatalolates.
[248:59.80]Flatalates.
[249:01.76]Fatalates?
[249:02.56]P-H...
[249:03.72]T-A-L-A-T... What do I spell this?
[249:07.26]Flatalates.
[249:10.35]Flatalates.
[249:14.39]Flatalates are chemical compounds used in a wide range of consumer products, including pesticides, paints, and PVC plastic.
[249:22.07]Okay.
[249:22.85]The contribution of dietary intake of flalacite.
[249:26.26]Flalacite.
[249:28.20]I tried to say malacite.
[249:30.78]I'm like Warcraft.
[249:33.07]But was not well defined until a landmark study published last year in the Journal of US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.
[249:40.67]Malasite has known to affect the genital development of lab rats, but human studies have also shown adverse effects on that.
[249:48.51]The most important findings to date have come from the study for future families, a multicenter study for prenatal clinics in California, Minnesota, and Missouri.
[249:56.27]It was a simple study.
[249:57.74]Researchers measured the levels of palatates flowing through the bodies of pregnant women and then later measured the size and characteristics of their... What did you do?
[250:10.52]Of their... They measured the size and characteristics of their...
[250:19.90]You did why?
[250:21.10]You did what?
[250:24.42]Why?
[250:24.84]What the fuck?
[250:32.97]You, after they were both, this is, that's unbelievable.
[250:36.11]Why would you do that?
[250:38.48]Why would you do that?
[250:47.44]That's... I can't... Alright, I'm gonna... That's unbelievable.
[250:51.26]So the kids were born and then... Okay.
[250:54.38]Goodbye.
[250:54.86]These changes... Social exposure to some of the same... Okay.
[251:02.80]What?
[251:03.99]What?
[251:04.95]What?
[251:09.21]So, okay.
[251:11.17]They did a study not on adults...
[251:23.89]Pregnant women should avoid poultry to protect their son's normal development.
[251:30.22]Okay.
[251:33.90]Well, I know for a fact that my mother ate chicken all the goddamn time.
[251:41.67]All the fucking time.
[251:43.35]All the time.
[251:44.71]Every, almost every day.
[251:47.75]I turned out just fine.
[251:49.19]Thank you.
[251:49.51]I turned out just fine.
[251:53.13]I'm fine.
[251:55.17]Nothing wrong with me.
[252:06.68]Can I even play this game right now?
[252:09.53]It's like one fucked up stupid ass study.
[252:12.15]Don't mind me.
[252:17.80]Guard dog?
[252:18.68]This dog hates me.
[252:21.62]It's because all the mayo canceled it out.
[252:23.38]Turtle dick?
[252:24.36]No, he said turkey dick.
[252:25.94]Oh, this one's off the rails.
[252:27.08]It's gone.
[252:27.50]Okay, we're getting the intel.
[252:49.74]I need a key.
[252:50.72]Fuck, I should have listened.
[252:51.56]Key!
[252:54.80]This person has a key.
[252:55.64]Alright, save here.
[252:56.60]Crouch.
[252:56.90]Does she have a gun?
[253:19.93]Do I get married up there?
[253:20.85]Why do I have to sneak?
[253:23.17]I am the bride.
[253:27.05]In certain missions, Kate can pickpocket enemies.
[253:31.14]Don't get spotted.
[253:31.82]Okay, let's get it.
[253:39.50]What do I do about this guy?
[253:41.02]I'm gonna knock this guy out.
[253:44.23]Can I distract him?
[253:45.23]Yes.
[253:45.55]Now, aren't you...
[253:49.34]I'm crying.
[253:51.98]What?
[253:52.44]Am I allowed to be here?
[253:58.16]Oh, I'm allowed- I'm actually allowed to be here.
[254:06.60]The guy on the balcony seems a little too fixated on her.
[254:10.02]Let's blind him a little with this perfume.
[254:12.22]I'm going to spray him in the eyes?
[254:15.06]Never could keep his eyes off of me.
[254:16.72]Alright.
[254:17.72]I'm going to spray him in the eyes.
[254:19.00]We have to be fast.
[254:20.90]Not like this.
[254:21.70]No.
[254:22.97]Bless your heart.
[254:24.23]What the hell?
[254:26.35]Quick.
[254:27.95]This isn't quite right, is it?
[254:30.01]Edit.
[254:30.73]There we go.
[254:33.65]I got the key.
[254:34.33]What are you guys doing?
[254:34.97]Omega Loli's blind.
[254:35.93]I just did it.
[254:36.49]I just did it.
[254:36.95]Not you, the dude.
[254:37.41]Oh, okay.
[254:37.59]Okay.
[255:02.10]Go up here.
[255:02.54]Oh shit, he has turkey in his eyes.
[255:03.92]I can't wait to eat some turkey.
[255:05.78]Turkey.
[255:34.00]What does this want me to do?
[255:34.70]This tutorial here.
[255:37.20]Knockout.
[255:39.16]Kate only knocks out guards and has no lethal takedown.
[255:42.21]She's carrying a rope to tie them up, so be careful they'll wake up again.
[255:44.69]Open.
[255:45.75]Come on.
[256:03.05]He probably... Alright.
[256:06.17]No.
[256:06.25]Stop.
[256:06.47]Stop.
[256:06.81]Stop.
[256:06.97]Stop.
[256:07.35]Stop.
[256:07.49]Stop.
[256:07.95]Stop.
[256:08.21]Good.
[256:08.35]Okay.
[256:08.47]Hurry up.
[256:08.69]Check this out.
[256:09.69]Ready?
[256:36.25]Where's the door?
[256:36.65]Oh, I gotta move it.
[256:37.27]Get in, get in, get in, get in.
[256:38.36]Okay, what the fuck just happened?
[256:40.24]How do I get in here?
[256:40.80]Are they killing us?
[256:42.14]Wait, they shot me.
[257:03.74]Oh fucking god damn it.
[257:05.42]There.
[257:05.68]Turkey?
[257:05.88]I left turkey?
[257:31.57]You know, I've been watching just in bed.
[257:33.53]I've been watching old commercials from like the 50s.
[257:38.19]Just hours of them.
[257:39.37]Just bored, lying there in bed.
[257:42.73]Something that I wish I could have and try and drink is coffee from 1950.
[257:47.69]It always looked so good on these commercials.
[257:51.47]I don't know why.
[257:52.83]It was always just a tiny little cup of just black coffee.
[257:56.47]I just want like 1940s coffee.
[258:03.07]Frank, I see you found my office.
[258:06.61]You should keep your friends waiting, Hagen.
[258:08.99]Well, sorry about that.
[258:11.21]The wedding, you understand.
[258:12.81]What are you watching that has commercials from the 50s?
[258:16.26]I'm watching 1950s commercial compilations.
[258:19.86]That's the content.
[258:24.86]Of course.
[258:26.23]Just give me a moment.
[258:29.65]Did I hear correctly that there was trouble in Flagstone yesterday?
[258:34.54]The usual.
[258:36.94]Doing drugs?
[258:38.22]I can imagine Mr. DeVitt isn't too happy about that.
[258:40.82]That's like a big snort.
[258:42.60]DeVitt isn't here.
[258:44.55]I wonder if he'd want you to leave things unfinished here.
[258:49.33]Or is there something more important in New Orleans?
[258:55.55]Maybe you should just get back to your wedding, Yeggins.
[259:01.71]Maybe you're right.
[259:03.55]Commercial compilations are underrated.
[259:05.63]Yeah.
[259:06.89]Well, she has every reason to be.
[259:09.49]Pardon?
[259:09.93]A long time ago, I used to just eat, like, king-size Reese's until I couldn't anymore while watching, like, old 90s commercials.
[259:17.08]You sold off her family, right?
[259:18.52]Like, 30 to 40 minutes each.
[259:20.02]I probably had, like, seven king-size Reese's bars.
[259:21.70]She doesn't have to find out until after the wedding, right?
[259:28.35]Not recently.
[259:29.11]This is, like, at least five years ago.
[259:33.04]I don't think it will make much difference in the end.
[259:39.15]Enjoy your wedding.
[259:42.43]Wait a second.
[259:43.33]I need a drink.
[259:58.62]I just stay in here.
[260:04.26]Let me ride the horse, please.
[260:06.19]The only thing I want.
[260:09.29]Sure you want to do this alone?
[260:11.79]This ain't a discussion.
[260:15.03]So what's your plan?
[260:17.59]Get in, find Frank, do what I came for.
[260:22.49]This is not the same mission.
[260:24.55]March to the front gate.
[260:26.19]Yeah.
[260:29.03]There's a path down those cliffs.
[260:32.38]Bernie is the Bernie voice.
[260:34.24]Follow that and climb up those vines from there.
[260:37.18]I'll wing it.
[260:38.16]That's no plan, amigo.
[260:40.84]I've pulled off limbs here once.
[260:42.59]I think something's up.
[260:45.03]I'll come and get you.
[260:46.53]No, you stay put.
[260:48.31]And it's not really.
[260:49.71]I kind of maybe you say I'm not even close.
[260:55.21]Come on.
[260:59.09]OK, where did you go?
[261:00.07]I need to go to enter the main lodge.
[261:04.07]I just wanted to try.
[261:18.76]I thought maybe I could like speed run, just run through it somehow.
[261:24.74]Alright.
[261:25.98]Time to do the mission.
[261:28.75]Hello, sir.
[261:35.85]Irma sounds tired.
[261:36.67]No, I'm alright.
[261:41.61]I have turkey on the brain, which means that I've seen all.
[261:44.59]Are we looking at you?
[261:48.67]Okay.
[261:48.97]I'm fine.
[261:49.71]I have full ammo.
[262:07.98]Look that way, please.
[262:08.91]Who the fuck is- Turkey releases chemicals that make you tired.
[262:28.82]That's a myth.
[262:29.66]It's not real.
[262:30.28]You're talking about tryptophan.
[262:32.14]That's not real.
[262:35.94]Tryptophan doesn't do anything.
[262:37.42]Yeah.
[262:38.48]I mean, it's expensive and all, but for a lady?
[262:41.11]Do you think I'd ever have one of those?
[262:50.91]Okay.
[262:51.55]Let's go.
[262:52.05]No.
[262:52.19]Why not?
[262:52.69]Okay, then.
[263:06.02]It can't be that expensive.
[263:08.18]How much is like a... Okay, how much is a statue made out of a metal like that?
[263:17.98]Not gold, not bronze.
[263:20.20]What's like a cheap metal?
[263:23.17]Okay, what if I had a statue of me made out of stainless steel?
[263:25.59]And why did this guy see me?
[263:29.81]Make it out of stainless steel.
[263:31.29]Or just like steel.
[263:32.37]500k?
[263:36.44]I just need a few seconds.
[263:38.70]You hear that?
[263:41.68]Shall we?
[263:42.86]Stainless steel is not cheap.
[263:44.06]Yeah, but it's cheaper than bronze, isn't it?
[263:47.34]I got lots of these.
[263:50.52]Oldest trick in the book.
[263:52.27]Throw it.
[263:52.81]Need some change.
[263:54.25]Not a problem.
[263:57.63]Now, okay, aluminum.
[263:58.83]Yeah.
[263:59.29]Okay, what if I had a statue made out of aluminum?
[264:02.07]How much would it realistically cost?
[264:04.70]What size?
[264:06.33]Uh, like, eight feet tall.
[264:16.97]Pure aluminum is expensive.
[264:18.35]Alright, but what if we're talking about, like, aluminum can?
[264:23.14]A statue made out of the... Not crushed.
[264:25.58]Before it gets crushed.
[264:27.95]And I know, dude, somebody's gonna walk up to that statue made out of aluminum can.
[264:31.86]And it's just gonna go up to my face.
[264:33.26]They're not gonna damage anything else.
[264:34.94]They're gonna press and squish the fist into my face.
[264:38.42]So I have a permanent, like, deformed, crushed-in face.
[264:42.88]That's the only damage they're gonna do to it.
[264:44.52]So I look horrible.
[264:50.99]I just need a few seconds.
[264:52.07]I'm gonna have to run.
[264:52.89]One, two, three, go.
[264:53.47]Okay.
[264:58.37]That doesn't... $10,000 not counting the payment for the artist.
[265:04.29]I cannot hide there?
[265:05.43]That's a bush.
[265:10.61]We will protect it.
[265:17.20]It's minimum 15k.
[265:17.96]The statue will be gone in an hour.
[265:28.87]That would be on local news.
[265:30.45]Oh, local funny man thought it would be interesting to make a $15,000 statue of himself and put it on his front lawn.
[265:43.42]By the time the reporter was done talking about it, it would be gone.
[265:52.05]Or destroyed.
[265:52.75]I just need a few seconds.
[265:58.50]Down.
[266:06.84]Local funny man.
[266:12.69]Eight people have beat up a statue to pieces.
[266:14.87]I would never want a statue of myself.
[266:27.82]To me, I don't think I would want that to happen to me.
[266:31.26]Unless, like, could it be a statue of me on the toilet with a newspaper in my hand just looking at the newspaper?
[266:44.76]I don't want to be, like, pointing in the distance with a book in my other hand.
[266:49.02]And, like, a big overcoat.
[266:50.08]No, I don't want that.
[266:51.28]Let's make it quick.
[267:03.72]New toilet statue.
[267:06.18]And I am straining.
[267:08.72]My face is just straining.
[267:16.48]Am I allowed in here yet?
[267:20.98]Have it be you on the toilet reading with the computer.
[267:28.23]No.
[267:29.21]No.
[267:38.15]Can I hide anywhere else?
[267:43.10]Up there?
[267:45.42]Okay, I'm going to go up here.
[267:47.10]I'm going to wish me... Have it be a Diablo toilet statue.
[267:53.82]Okay.
[268:02.03]Well, we can't all be as lucky as Miss O'Hara.
[268:05.47]Are you jealous?
[268:06.43]Fuck these chairs, by the way.
[268:07.97]I'm convinced that there's never one of these is ever clean.
[268:10.87]I think they've been using the same ones for like a hundred years.
[268:14.89]These come brand new with a bunch of scuff barks and dirt and like footprints all over it.
[268:21.22]I hate these things.
[268:25.84]Shall we?
[268:35.63]in.
[268:36.79]Alright, I gotta get in here.
[268:38.71]Wait, where do I have to get in?
[268:39.99]Enter the main lodge.
[268:40.79]Yeah.
[268:41.31]Alright, I gotta get up there.
[268:43.29]So, can I climb that?
[268:44.51]I have to go through this.
[268:47.20]Alright, they're distracted a little bit.
[268:48.80]Does this person care that I'm here?
[268:52.98]Or is it just the guards?
[268:55.30]I didn't fucking see that guy.
[268:59.74]Give us a joke?
[269:00.52]You got it.
[269:09.58]Get it, get it, get it.
[269:23.25]Run, run, run, run, duck.
[269:26.76]This game is sick.
[269:33.78]Don't rush me, don't rush me.
[269:39.38]Do not rush me.
[269:42.56]I can crouch up until... These guys are just talking to each other.
[269:46.59]I can go up to here and crouch.
[269:53.27]I can cross the whole thing.
[269:54.29]Join these guys.
[269:56.43]What's it like, Frank, to just ride off like that?
[270:00.11]What's that noise?
[270:01.43]Sure thing.
[270:01.79]And we're going to kill this dude quickly, quietly.
[270:04.42]See you later.
[270:07.42]And dump him.
[270:09.16]What the hell?
[270:19.00]Not a problem.
[270:23.74]Just a scratch.
[270:26.86]I see you, asshole.
[270:30.57]You weren't hiding, man.
[270:31.95]I'm trying to dump him.
[270:35.22]Please stop playing and talk about mayo again.
[270:37.00]Oh, please.
[270:39.52]We want more mayo, please.
[270:41.78]Oh, you like mayo now, huh?
[270:43.56]Interesting.
[270:51.50]What are you doing?
[270:53.65]Why would you... I'm trying to throw him.

[275:51.07]No chance we'll get through there.
[275:53.03]Not without some serious firepower.
[275:55.42]You know how to pull the trigger of a Gatling gun?
[275:57.99]I sure do.
[275:59.07]But, um, why does it have a pink ribbon?
[276:01.93]It's a wedding present.
[276:03.47]Don't ask.
[276:04.51]Ooh, Omega Lo.
[276:04.91]What are you talking about?
[276:05.57]Steal the maid's clothes.
[276:06.07]Why don't we just change clothes?
[276:07.05]You know, like, very clearly, I'm not the one they're looking for, but I'm in the gown.
[276:32.82]And I'd be like, they'll grab me and be like, I swear to God, I swear to God, I bought this on eBay.
[276:37.49]I got this on eBay.
[276:38.43]It's an eBay dress.
[276:40.31]And she's just in my clothes doing whatever she needs to do.
[276:42.15]I'm just like the guy in the wedding gown.
[276:44.61]It's not like, there she is.
[276:45.67]It's like, wait, there's a guy in a wedding dress over there.
[276:48.10]Let's talk to him.
[276:52.58]There's only one wedding dress, but I would confuse the fuck out of everybody.
[276:55.78]Because they're looking for her.
[276:58.22]I'm going to switch clothes.
[277:02.74]Are we at the right wedding?
[277:03.86]Where are we?
[277:04.38]Can I take the shotgun?
[277:05.70]I can't put him in there?
[277:06.41]Oh, right.
[277:07.77]Who cares?
[277:08.55]Let's just leave.
[277:09.15]Stop.
[277:09.35]Grouch.
[277:34.33]How far can you throw?
[277:36.45]Let's give him some trouble.
[277:38.05]Just a harmless sneeze.
[277:40.76]Damn.
[277:41.04]Alright, we gotta go this way.
[277:41.78]How am I gonna take care of this?
[277:51.44]I guess in this bush?
[277:52.48]I got lots of these.
[277:57.61]Let's make it quick.
[277:58.25]It wouldn't take you for a man who throws away money.
[278:00.55]It's just pennies.
[278:01.63]Every penny counts, Mr. Cooper.
[278:03.55]Not if they're fake.
[278:04.62]He just clearly watched me do that.
[278:10.30]Alright, we're good.
[278:16.74]Somehow I need to stop him.
[278:17.96]How am I going to stop him?
[278:21.35]Potions?
[278:23.07]See, how far can I go?
[278:25.39]I've had enough of weddings.
[278:30.17]I'll ask again.
[278:34.24]See her.
[278:34.98]Don't worry.
[278:35.62]Give it a try.
[278:37.84]What's that?
[278:39.46]Tear gas?
[278:40.10]Perfume from my late suitor.
[278:41.80]This is not a hider.
[278:42.85]I guess love is blinding after all.
[278:45.45]Oh, shame on you, Mr. Cooper.
[278:47.93]Let's leave quietly.
[278:49.85]Hey, now.

[279:51.12]Oh, yeah, feel?
[279:51.76]Well, I guess love is blinding after all.
[279:54.58]Oh, shame on you, Mr. Cooper.
[279:58.02]Keep it cool.
[280:00.30]Quit with the knife.

[280:10.59]I have to beat this.
[280:45.78]I need a big picture.
[280:47.02]There's tons of places to hide.
[280:50.27]This guy comes down.
[280:52.19]Eyes on this guy.
[280:53.07]Alright?
[280:54.59]Do it up here in the front.

[285:39.61]I think we have to incapacitate, but they'll hear it.
[285:46.03]Okay, here's the plan.
[285:46.85]The plan is you gotta throw one.
[285:48.69]Throw it out there.
[285:50.17]And then showtime.
[285:51.05]Pick.
[285:51.15]Stab.
[285:51.29]She has to stab.
[285:51.89]Teamwork.
[285:52.23]Beautiful.
[285:52.59]Okay, you have to tie him up.
[285:54.31]Okay.
[286:19.70]Hurry before she turns around.
[286:20.75]She's going to turn around.
[286:25.81]Go.
[286:26.13]Stand up and drag him.
[286:27.49]Why are you riding him like a surfboard?
[286:29.83]Pick him up.
[286:30.79]This guy comes near me.
[286:37.80]He's dead.
[286:50.49]No, okay, I got it I got it I got it I got it
[287:24.34]Okay.
[287:27.60]Q. Stab.

[287:31.06]Did you not throw it?
[287:35.93]Okay.
[287:36.67]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

[287:39.37]Done.
[287:56.68]It's just her.
[287:59.84]Now, let's go get it.
[288:00.66]Let's close quick.
[288:01.14]Okay, good.
[288:01.58]Kate's disguises.
[288:02.00]Once Kate has picked up a disguise, she can put it on by pressing T.
[288:26.82]While disguised, you can traverse enemy territory almost undetected.
[288:30.85]Dogs in long coats will see through the disguise.
[288:34.61]Let's raise some hell.
[288:36.31]A T. Now.
[288:38.05]Just a minute.
[288:40.04]What do you think?
[288:41.00]You look like a wolf in maid's clothing.
[288:43.02]You think it's enough to fool him?
[288:44.62]Only one way to find out.
[288:45.96]Alright, now we have to... Does guards know you're here?
[288:49.29]Escape from the compound.
[288:58.00]Wait, she's allowed here, but I'm not allowed here.
[289:04.99]E?
[289:06.23]Alert.
[289:06.55]Alert with an enemy to keep their eyes on you.
[289:09.45]That didn't work.
[289:11.92]What?
[289:28.14]It was supposed to work.
[289:36.82]Eyes still work.
[289:39.40]Yeah, they're not cupping both of their hands over their eyes.
[289:43.78]Like they're looking into the distance and leaning forward and staring into her face.
[289:57.79]Where are we?
[289:59.48]Alright, let's go.
[290:01.06]We have to go around here.
[290:07.66]Alright.
[290:12.84]Down here.
[290:13.20]Here we go.
[290:14.24]Throw gas in his face.
[290:15.25]And then stand up and go talk to him.
[290:18.63]Oh, fuck.
[290:19.17]Wait, I thought this was supposed to be...
[290:43.87]Ready for it.
[290:44.71]Sure thing.
[290:47.87]Get out of here.
[290:49.23]What is that?
[290:50.80]What can I do you for?
[290:52.16]Sorry in advance, darling.
[290:54.88]What?
[290:55.24]I got you.
[290:56.06]Does this keep happening?
[290:59.32]What's wrong with you?
[290:59.92]I was trying to, I don't know.
[291:04.86]How am I?
[291:05.42]I guess I could distract him and climb.
[291:06.72]Let's leave this mess of a party.
[291:14.48]Just distract this guy.
[291:15.52]That doesn't work on him though.
[291:17.96]He's a long coat, right?
[291:21.71]No, that does work on him.
[291:22.63]Alright, here we go.
[291:23.07]Ready?
[291:23.23]I thought I could sneak around.
[291:26.41]The edges were there.
[291:47.46]You saw the edge.
[291:48.80]I could have.
[291:49.70]He just bumped into him.
[291:50.49]Alright, let's go.
[291:52.97]Do we have to wait forever?
[291:55.03]We would right now while he's looking the other way.
[291:57.19]Okay.
[291:58.83]Quick, quick, quick.
[292:07.61]Dump him.
[292:07.88]Dump him.
[292:08.08]Dump him in the...

[293:31.46]Sure.
[293:31.68]You can do it to anybody.
[293:34.04]I'll ask again.
[293:34.94]But he's pissed.

[300:23.40]Are you still the same stage?
[300:26.70]Uh, well, you may not have.
[300:28.08]When you left, we kind of went on a food pyramid rant.
[300:32.82]And it wasn't a regular one that lasts usually like 10, 15.
[300:35.14]This was about an hour and 20 minutes.
[300:38.03]That was a very long one.
[300:45.38]Okay.
[300:46.90]Almost there.
[300:48.16]Got a dog?
[300:48.76]Gotta go out of this door and stand right there.
[300:52.48]Gotta go this way.
[300:56.77]It's now or never.
[301:02.11]Can you get sniffed in the bush?
[301:07.89]One of us has to take a shit.
[301:10.79]Oh, I didn't think it.
[301:12.69]I'm all.
[301:15.87]Why am I sneaking around?
[301:18.01]We let's give this wedding present a spin.
[301:21.23]Y'all ready?
[301:21.73]I can shoot this thing.
[301:28.53]I'll play.
[301:28.91]Here's my wedding present.
[301:30.41]Mind if I get to know that?
[301:31.69]Can't be my guest, Mr. Cooper.
[301:34.59]Kill this guy, right?
[301:35.25]Because he's going to... Oh, he almost got hit in the head.
[301:43.09]He's going to see through.
[301:45.59]I need to get on that Gatling gun.
[302:01.35]I gotta move fast.
[302:02.25]I gotta move fast.

[302:32.55]Stop.
[302:33.09]I'm almost done.
[302:34.71]I have to beat this.
[302:35.69]I'm not very good at these games.
[302:40.09]I'm not very good at these.
[302:41.97]This is fun.
[302:44.25]I like this, but I'm not very good at this.
[302:47.13]I'm not going to be able to do it.
[302:59.47]Holy shit, I did it.
[303:00.11]I gotta distract this one to turn him this way.
[303:03.57]Who's looking at him?
[303:04.51]You, but what's the view?
[303:28.48]Are you the one that's... What does this guy do?
[303:30.18]He turns around?
[303:33.18]There's more where that came from.
[303:35.39]You've got a lovely voice.
[303:38.13]Wait.
[303:38.95]Oh, shit.
[303:39.17]Keep it cool.
[303:54.26]Get this fucking dog away from me.
[303:56.59]Get this dog away from me.
[303:57.75]Get away, get away, get away.
[303:58.55]And now what?
[303:59.47]Now we gotta go like this.
[304:04.23]I have to distract this guy now.
[304:05.41]Oh.

[304:38.14]How do you fire the gun?

[306:21.94]Fuck you.
[306:25.64]Oh, I can't even handle it.
[306:26.90]I'm going to have to quit.
[306:30.27]I can't do it.

[306:56.07]Exit stage left.
[306:58.41]Run, quick.
[307:03.01]I'll play the charmer.
[307:04.57]I was wondering.

[307:25.78]I didn't even... Quite the excitement.
[307:29.97]Let's dazzle him.
[307:31.91]I was wondering.
[307:32.81]Eyes open.
[307:34.27]How can I help you?
[307:37.51]Hurry up.
[307:39.03]I still can't believe he would gift her a Gatling gun, of all things.
[307:42.58]What?
[307:43.96]I don't know what to do.
[307:44.66]I don't know.
[307:45.72]I don't know.
[307:46.50]I don't get it.
[307:47.02]I think I have to... Okay.
[307:49.70]Just... I got a better idea.
[307:52.11]I got good aim.
[307:54.76]Wait, did I kill her?
[307:55.48]Well, holy shit.
[307:56.70]Okay, that's... I get it.
[307:57.96]I get it.

[309:06.11]Meet me over there.
[309:06.61]Meet me over there.
[309:07.12]Yes!
[309:25.56]Sorry, I'm awake.
[309:27.68]I'm awake.
[309:29.00]So you must be Mr. Cooper's friend.
[309:32.56]And you are.
[309:33.68]Kate O'Hara.
[309:35.00]Pleasure to meet you.
[309:36.40]That wasn't hard.
[309:37.80]No, it wasn't.
[309:39.41]I don't know why.
[309:40.09]I just thought it said she didn't have any weapons and she didn't have any guns or anything.
[309:44.15]So I was like, oh, she doesn't have weapons.
[309:45.89]Listen, I got someone that could help us.
[309:48.33]She can't use weapons.
[309:49.31]I was like, okay, what?
[309:50.81]Thing is, he doesn't work for free.
[309:54.80]I'm sure Higgins has no objection to this investment.
[309:58.68]Alright, Hector.
[309:59.59]You go with Ms.
[310:00.27]O'Hara.
[310:02.63]I think we have until sundown before the David men come for the ranch.
[310:06.53]Yeah, I'm going to call it here, by the way.
[310:08.15]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[310:09.19]I'm actually really hungry.
[310:10.40]Wouldn't be the first time.
[310:23.34]I want to see the end of this stuff here, though.
[310:30.68]I'll see you tomorrow.
[310:33.05]We're not going to play Desperados tomorrow.
[310:41.15]I'm going to give you guys a list of things to play.
[310:42.87]From our own pre-stream chat, if you're there.
[310:45.81]Probably about 30 to 40 minutes before stream, I pop in.
[310:49.51]Sometimes a little more than that.
[310:54.90]Don't use disguise.
[310:55.70]How would you even do that?
[310:57.28]Take a photo of the dead groom.
[310:59.64]Where did I get a camera?
[311:02.56]Oh, you can bring him all the way out there.
[311:07.08]And lay him on the ground and take a picture.
[311:09.86]But you have to take him all the way to the beginning of the level.
[311:11.54]Yeah, there'll be a poll tomorrow.
[311:16.70]Because I need to figure out what it's going to be.
[311:18.06]It'll be probably three or four different games.
[311:20.82]I did that.
[311:22.74]Don't use the Gatling gun.
[311:26.39]Kill everyone except for civilians.
[311:27.81]I didn't do that.
[311:32.16]Here we go.
[311:51.16]Ratatouille?
[311:55.08]I'm making a pretty good statue, though.
[311:56.44]This is a big, muscly guy.
[311:59.80]Come on, go down here and complete it.
[312:01.08]No, Jeremy, you messed it up.
[312:06.17]You idiot.
[312:07.15]You had an opportunity.
[312:14.43]Uh, no, not VR.
[312:15.29]Not VR.
[312:17.03]Not VR.
[312:35.63]Sorry.
[312:39.49]What should I play though?
[312:41.15]It's going to be either GameCube.
[312:43.07]It might even be 3DO.
[312:45.03]I might finally bust that thing out and actually play the damn thing.
[312:48.67]I have like 10 games for it too.
[312:55.42]I only bought the 3DO for one reason.
[312:57.20]Because I wanted to play this game.
[312:58.38]I'll tell you exactly what it is.
[312:59.38]I'll give you the exact name.
[313:24.09]It's called Twisted.
[313:26.41]The game show.
[313:30.88]It's an FMV game show game.
[313:34.30]And it looks just... It looks, you know, how they all look.
[313:39.14]Could be terrible.
[313:40.14]It's the only reason why I bought it.
[313:51.71]Not symmetrical.
[313:52.47]I'm annoyed.
[313:55.89]I always kill one person accidentally somehow.
[313:57.91]Zero bodies discovered, though.
[314:00.65]How did Kate kill- Oh, right, right.
[314:02.79]Because she went absolutely nuts.
[314:06.07]God, I was going to say, that doesn't make any sense.
[314:07.48]You can't kill people.
[314:14.50]A maid was a civilian?
[314:16.04]Oh, that's right, yeah.
[314:21.02]This game's pretty good.
[314:23.21]How many levels are in the game?
[314:25.63]Was it like 3 chapters?
[314:26.55]4 chapters?
[314:27.09]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, what?
[314:31.51]18 levels?
[314:31.75]20?
[314:33.01]30?
[314:33.19]Oh, I can see why people like it.
[314:37.98]If you're good at video games and you like planning stuff, you can do a lot of that stuff very, very quickly.
[314:42.28]Simultaneously.
[314:49.27]But yeah, we're not going to play it tomorrow.
[314:50.37]We're going to do either 3DO, GameCube...
[314:54.16]Or something else.
[314:54.94]I'll give you a poll tomorrow.
[314:57.52]Thanks for watching.
[314:59.81]Sorry we kind of... The whole stream derailed for a full hour.
[315:06.11]We did the podcast episode where I talk about mayonnaise.
[315:09.35]Sorry about that.
[315:12.65]But I had a lot of fun.
[315:15.66]It was also $50.
[315:16.82]There was 5,000 bits from Zombie Eater.
[315:21.26]Thank you, Zombie Eater.
[315:24.58]Say, next time you go to the doctor regarding the mystery illness, show them the food pyramid to see how wrong you are.
[315:33.36]It's not a bad diet.
[315:35.14]The mayonnaise, I don't eat that much mayonnaise.
[315:36.71]It's like two rungs down.
[315:39.57]I'm a liar.
[315:40.53]I'm kidding.
[315:41.01]I'm a funny guy.
[315:42.77]Right?
[315:44.45]I don't eat that much mayonnaise.
[315:45.61]Mayonnaise is gross.
[315:49.38]You need vegetables, dude.
[315:50.48]Vegetables is like number... It's like the third most thing I eat.
[315:54.58]I eat a shitload of greens.
[315:55.84]I eat a shitload of radishes.
[315:58.12]Broccoli.
[315:58.76]Spinach.
[315:59.48]Kale.
[316:00.66]Radishes.
[316:01.58]Daikon radish.
[316:05.65]That's like almost a third of everything I eat.
[316:10.73]And then a shitload of beans.
[316:11.95]A bunch of nuts.
[316:15.35]Seeds.
[316:17.89]He's a rodent.
[316:28.19]He eats beans.
[316:29.05]No, stop eating so much bread.
[316:30.89]See, you guys are talking like that because you have too much bread on your mind.
[316:39.43]Slow down on the bread.
[316:41.38]Take it from me.
[316:46.20]Anyways, thank you, Zombie Eater, for the $50.

[318:58.37]And I've been gone for months.
[319:01.03]There's been a lot of time for people to refine a lot of their submissions.
[319:07.38]I'm looking forward to it.
[319:10.60]But that's it.
[319:12.46]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
