[00:03.71]Alright, let me make sure the stuff for the sponsor segment is ready.
[00:08.71]By the way... Oh, I gotta think of a good title.
[00:12.39]What should I title this?
[00:16.44]What should I title this?
[00:24.50]There are drops gonna be on, by the way.
[00:29.74]If you want to potentially get access to Multiversus, by the way, the open beta, I believe it's the 26th.
[00:45.03]Do an apology video for being wrong about Ant-Man.
[00:48.83]I already said I'm sorry.
[00:50.57]I already apologized.
[00:51.55]Alright, let's go.
[00:55.49]I gotta change the title to something.
[00:57.55]What if I... I gotta think of a good... Give me a good grabbable title.
[01:03.45]Something that I can... Something that's gonna grab people.
[01:05.25]You know what I mean?
[01:12.54]Let me make sure that's there.
[01:13.94]Hey, can you guys confirm that the images in the bottom of the stream?
[01:20.08]Yeah, there it is.
[01:20.80]Alright, cool.
[01:21.20]It's there.
[01:23.00]This should be a chatbot too.
[01:31.84]I can't believe he rides bugs.
[01:33.64]I can't believe it.
[01:40.78]Alright.
[01:42.38]So... I am... I cannot wait.
[01:49.27]I didn't practice that much off stream, by the way.
[01:55.15]But I will do my best.
[01:59.71]Title.
[02:00.07]What's a good title?
[02:03.40]MultiVersus.
[02:06.76]Okay, give me one more second.
[02:09.78]Rating the best bugs and being the best Bugs Bunny player later.
[02:13.25]Oh, that's not gonna work.
[02:14.15]Alright, how about, um... I can put my camera back on so you guys don't all freak out.
[02:19.99]That's better.
[02:21.25]Okay, how about, uh... Hmm.
[02:27.60]How about... Let's go for it!
[02:32.64]What do I put here?
[02:33.54]I don't know what to do.
[02:34.72]What's a good... I need to get a good title.
[02:38.80]How about Bugs In It Up?
[02:43.52]How about... Buggin' Out.
[02:50.81]No.
[02:54.07]Bugs Andy.
[02:57.53]Alright.
[02:57.75]How about... Let's go with...
[03:03.96]What should I do?
[03:05.10]For... I have to think of a good title.
[03:08.94]In the next 10 seconds.
[03:14.56]Okay.
[03:15.34]We'll just do... Back... In the... Back in Multiversus.
[03:25.72]Let's... Go!
[03:28.62]That sucks!
[03:32.16]Back in multiverses.
[03:35.52]Bugs Andy.
[03:38.30]No.
[03:39.82]Back in multiverses.
[03:42.87]Bugs.
[03:43.55]Bugs.
[03:44.13]Bugs.
[03:44.51]Bugs.
[03:44.99]Bugs.
[03:45.27]Bugs.
[03:45.71]That's good.
[03:54.81]I'll put, say, drops enabled as well.
[04:02.23]That looks good.
[04:03.23]Alright.
[04:04.61]Let's fucking freaking go.
[04:07.05]Let's freaking go.
[04:08.66]Let's freaking go.
[04:10.42]Let's freaking go.
[04:11.52]I don't think that's a problem.
[04:19.10]I don't think that's a problem.
[04:21.87]Are you guys ready?
[04:24.79]Why is my facecam so huge?
[04:26.11]Alright.
[04:31.57]Alright, I'm ready.
[04:32.73]Don't quit!
[04:35.31]We're gonna do teams.
[04:39.68]I practiced a tiny bit.
[04:41.70]This is a sponsored stream, by the way.
[04:44.28]Wait, what?
[04:46.94]Cross-platform.
[04:47.90]Yeah, that's fine.
[04:50.95]I'm so ready for this.
[04:53.05]But thank you, thank you to Warner Brothers Interactive.
[04:56.35]Seriously, sponsoring this stream.
[04:59.01]Drops are enabled.
[05:00.11]If you have drops on, keep it on.
[05:03.99]If you watch for an hour, that's how you get access to the game.
[05:10.57]By the skin?
[05:14.36]This is, by the way, this is why I love this shit.
[05:18.00]Cross platform.
[05:19.70]Cross progression.
[05:21.76]PC.
[05:24.01]Xbox, PlayStation.
[05:25.75]You can play with each other.
[05:26.87]You can cross progression.
[05:28.51]It's fucking awesome.
[05:32.73]Am I going?
[05:33.75]Oh, yeah, let's go.
[05:37.38]Yeah, mods.
[05:37.86]Keep an eye on the bot.
[05:38.64]This should be a chat bot.
[05:42.86]Yeah, I have drops enabled right now.
[05:47.10]Alright, me and Steven Universe versus Shaggy and Garnet.
[05:51.39]I think I'm level 1, so...
[05:53.47]All progression will carry over, by the way.
[05:55.91]Yes, it will.
[06:05.86]I don't think... I think you guys are not... I think you guys are not ready for how well I think I'm going to do here.
[06:11.88]Check it out.
[06:14.34]Oh, by the way, what's that?
[06:15.48]Oh, excuse me.
[06:16.54]Bingo.
[06:19.26]That's right.
[06:19.79]Take a look at that.
[06:26.18]I thought it was the other character for a second.
[06:35.78]I gotta remember the controls and everything.
[06:42.77]Stronger together.
[06:57.64]Alright.
[06:57.94]Keep it together.
[06:58.38]Keep it together.
[06:58.72]We got it.
[06:58.92]We got it.
[07:08.13]Oh!
[07:08.61]That's gonna be a double.
[07:11.05]See you later.
[07:17.46]Come on.
[07:17.80]Come on, Steve.
[07:19.16]Come on, Steve.
[07:25.80]I'm going under.
[07:26.26]Going under.
[07:26.54]Going under.
[07:35.91]Do it!
[07:36.92]Yeah, see you later!
[07:46.64]What is that?
[07:52.95]It's all good, we're good, we're good, we got the advantage, we're good.
[07:55.95]Nice job, Steve.
[08:12.80]I'm alright.
[08:13.26]Sorry, I have to probably just peak the mic.
[08:17.00]Multiverses!
[08:17.97]Open beta on July 26th!
[08:28.26]Where are you?
[08:30.20]That was weird.
[08:43.81]Drop it.
[08:49.48]Oh!
[08:50.20]Okay.
[08:50.78]See ya.
[08:57.20]I'll give you that one.
[08:59.66]That's it, right?
[09:00.86]Victory!
[09:06.00]Oh, Trevor.
[09:07.50]Trevor, you can't play video games.
[09:10.60]Gee, ain't I a stinker?
[09:16.63]I gotta tell you something.
[09:19.73]I said this before.
[09:20.95]I'm gonna say it again.
[09:23.69]The netcode in this game is unbelievable.
[09:29.27]It feels fantastic to play this game.
[09:33.85]You heard me say this already.
[09:38.73]Everything feels one-to-one.
[09:40.09]One-to-one.
[09:45.44]A lot of times when I've ever tried to play a fighting game like this, or anything like this, hitting X and waiting .3 seconds?
[09:55.43]X. X. I can't do it.
[10:00.00]The netcode is amazing.
[10:02.30]I don't know what they did or how they did it, but seriously, it's so good.
[10:09.66]Yeah, no, that is my honest-to-goodness opinion.
[10:15.64]Rollback netcode.
[10:16.84]Yeah.
[10:18.34]And, man, it's good.
[10:25.84]So, from my understanding, I didn't know this before, this game is supposed to be played with teams.
[10:33.20]Each character has, from my understanding, different party moves.
[10:40.38]It's not really designed for 1v1.
[10:41.92]I guess it is, but...
[10:49.27]I'm not surprised how good the netcode is.
[10:55.72]I'm not surprised.
[10:57.56]I played this already.
[10:58.32]Remember when I got cut off and I wanted to play it so bad?
[11:01.16]Let's go two for two.
[11:01.72]Here we go.
[11:10.71]Almost had it.
[11:36.05]Give me that shield.
[11:44.39]Oh my god, I don't know what just happened.
[12:20.88]It's alright, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[12:21.84]Just pull, pull, pull, pull together, pull together.
[12:23.12]Get two kills here.
[12:24.12]Don't let him do that!
[12:25.00]One pike.
[13:04.06]We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[13:10.62]Try that again.
[13:54.45]Give me some give me some give me give me give me give me give me That's huge pull together make it happen Oh
[14:42.63]Don't let him get away!
[14:54.52]This guy just bouncing around!
[14:55.78]Just get rid of him!
[15:04.28]Alright, that was a little sloppy.
[15:07.75]That was a little sloppy.
[15:08.51]But I'll take it.
[15:11.81]That was a little sloppy.
[15:12.51]Should I try the new silent streamer?
[15:22.21]Dude, I'm just cranking out the game!
[15:27.90]Do a backflip?
[15:33.18]I'm not doing it.
[15:33.94]Wait, I gotta tweet.
[15:39.00]Let's go.
[15:40.76]Tweet out.
[15:43.23]I just had to warm up.
[15:44.11]I had to warm up a little.
[15:47.47]So, are you guys getting drops?
[15:49.55]Does it work?
[15:55.53]You have to watch for an hour?
[15:59.91]Okay.
[16:00.39]Just want to make sure it works.
[16:03.59]Alright, this is the new character.
[16:04.65]This is Iron Giant.
[16:05.45]Should I just get my ass kicked with Iron Giant?
[16:16.34]Is he any good?
[16:19.83]He's... Whoa, okay.
[16:23.37]I'll try it.
[16:31.36]I'm so... I'm so excited, man.
[16:34.60]You know, I've been waiting to play a game like this.
[16:42.75]So I'm going to let my Batman down here.
[16:44.63]I have no idea what the moves are.
[16:45.69]I don't have a single clue.
[16:49.69]Prepare yourselves!
[17:01.41]Yeah, you gotta make a WBGames account and then link your Twitch to it.
[17:09.24]Alright, let's see.
[17:11.00]What do you got?
[17:12.76]He just eats?
[17:14.82]What does he eat?
[17:19.28]He's huge!
[17:23.41]I think I'm doing okay.
[17:28.47]Oh, it's a grab?
[17:33.48]I'm just, like, in the way.
[17:39.01]Oh my god, this guy is cracked.
[17:43.05]He's got a big butt stomp.
[17:51.18]Protect friend!
[17:51.76]What's that mean?
[17:52.16]I think I have a defense move.
[17:56.64]Whoa!
[17:57.32]It's like... I have two different forms?
[18:00.25]Alright, I gotta go look this up.
[18:02.05]I gotta go in the lab.
[18:07.56]I just like big booted.
[18:11.88]Drop.
[18:27.59]We're still good.
[18:33.68]What is it down?
[18:34.44]What is up?
[18:38.13]What just happened to Superman?
[18:41.01]I have no idea what I just did, but that guy was trapped.
[18:49.93]I hit the guy with like a hundred frame data.
[18:51.61]Shit.
[18:51.97]It's alright.
[18:57.69]It's not a...
[19:09.43]So this is a colossal character.
[19:10.89]It's the first one that... That makes sense.
[19:12.41]He's really slow.
[19:22.80]I like that move.
[19:24.18]The big right hand.
[19:32.74]What does this side special do?
[19:41.07]I think the side special is a grab.
[19:42.57]I have like a power up.
[19:45.95]I can protect the friend.
[19:49.63]He's really good.
[19:56.29]Let's do that again.
[19:57.37]Um, I guess so I'll do it.
[20:05.27]he can fight.
[20:07.25]Well, is Iron Giant technically fighting?
[20:09.86]He's like punching cars and stuff, right?
[20:11.98]I don't know.
[20:17.06]Should I do Bugs?
[20:17.58]Alright, I want to level up Bugs' money.
[20:30.66]I got to find out the scenario to use some of his moves.
[20:33.26]Because Bugs is cool, but he's got a lot of cooldowns.
[20:39.64]You're playing the... You're the little brother?
[20:42.76]Well, guess what, man?
[20:43.58]The little brother has not lost a match since starting.
[20:50.56]This is... This is fun.
[20:53.11]This is fun.
[20:59.53]I'll do some 1v1s after this, too.
[21:00.49]That was a good stun right to start it.
[21:36.37]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[21:37.23]Wrong move!
[21:38.43]Stupid time, B-Man!
[21:40.75]Just for you!
[21:58.34]Oh my, I almost hit him with the end of that rocket.
[22:00.84]I'll give you that one.
[22:13.78]Hit him, hit him, hit him, hit him, hit him.
[22:24.94]Ooh, nice.
[22:32.69]Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[22:33.83]Getting sloppy.
[22:44.44]Knock it over there.
[22:44.92]Yep.
[22:45.56]Denial.
[22:46.00]Area denial.
[22:59.11]There it is.
[23:01.93]Getting sloppy.
[23:02.93]No, we pulled it back.
[23:03.77]We pulled it back.
[23:09.42]Bugs has an amazing up air.
[23:12.06]That bat swinging the bat up is awesome.
[23:15.34]By the way, this game's gonna be free to play.
[23:16.90]It's free to play.
[23:23.92]Buy an announcer pack?
[23:35.56]Okay.
[23:37.12]I kinda wanna take the Iron Giant into the, uh... ...into the lab.
[23:46.47]Choose your character.
[23:50.92]Should I take that?
[23:51.46]I want to learn how to do it.
[24:04.41]Let me go back.
[24:05.01]I want to see... Because I don't want to just press buttons.
[24:13.69]Okay, so...
[24:17.23]That's his charge move.
[24:18.49]That looks cool.
[24:20.05]What's the combo?
[24:20.97]The combo is just the smash smash butt bounce.
[24:26.39]Okay.
[24:28.35]What about up air?
[24:29.32]I mean up.
[24:29.94]Alright, so that's what I was doing.
[24:31.04]He actually throws something.
[24:34.66]Alright, the projectile can be the longer you hold it.
[24:38.26]Oh, that's annoying.
[24:39.58]That's going to be so annoying.
[24:43.85]You just be an annoying just shithead here.
[24:48.74]Okay, so that's what that does.
[24:50.32]What about down?
[24:55.19]So down attack makes these bolts that you eat.
[24:59.75]And what, after how many?
[25:00.79]Okay, you have max of five bolts.
[25:07.90]What do the bolts do?
[25:11.65]Let's find out.
[25:12.19]Okay, so that's that.
[25:14.17]Alright, what does this do?
[25:16.05]So that's the grab.
[25:18.67]He just kind of grabs.
[25:19.64]Alright, I just used bolts.
[25:23.98]Oh, it's a shield!
[25:24.88]I get it.
[25:27.72]You can throw.
[25:28.66]You can probably do it again and throw.
[25:31.06]Why is the computer fighting back?
[25:31.98]Okay, that's what you want to do.
[25:39.48]It's up and X.
[25:47.82]Okay, so that's... Yeah, I can pick where this goes?
[25:56.29]Okay.
[26:01.55]Alright, that's why.
[26:02.55]I was having trouble figuring out what that was doing.
[26:04.81]If you just do it in the air, you go straight down.
[26:06.65]Alright, and if you... That's obviously dodge.
[26:10.16]Dodge.
[26:13.73]Okay, so what about... What is the standard?
[26:15.45]The standard special is just... Does it hurt?
[26:20.79]No, I think it's just shield.
[26:23.29]It's the grab, the butt stomp.
[26:25.57]What is up special?
[26:31.44]Okay.
[26:31.74]I think that uses a bolt.
[26:35.78]Do I fly with this here?
[26:38.32]Okay.
[26:39.52]Alright, doesn't seem that complicated.
[26:40.86]I have a better idea of what's happening.
[26:44.56]Protect friends.
[26:47.92]Yeah, what is this?
[26:48.88]This is a whole new moveset now.
[26:59.04]Okay, that's awesome.
[27:04.91]How did I get that to happen?
[27:08.43]I think I just build a meter.
[27:09.65]Yeah, it's a meter you build.
[27:17.68]I can aim that.
[27:20.50]Kind of like a helicopter blade.
[27:27.32]Alright, I think I get it.
[27:36.79]Let's do it in the game.
[27:39.93]Does exclamation point drops do anything?
[27:42.63]I don't think that does anything.
[27:47.32]I don't think that does anything.
[27:49.76]Why is everybody doing that?
[27:51.86]Oh, okay.
[27:52.48]People are just spamming.
[27:53.50]I get it.
[27:53.86]Okay.
[27:55.76]That doesn't do anything.
[28:03.06]What was I... Where's my... Let me see here.
[28:07.07]Okay, we're good.
[28:09.55]I'm going to try to play another game with Iron Giant.
[28:14.09]I think I have some currency, too.
[28:17.45]Alright, teams again.
[28:23.70]Let me do some 1v1s.
[28:27.04]Free-for-all.
[28:30.34]Okay, I'm going to do 1v1.
[28:32.86]Let's see how badly I get my ass kicked.
[28:37.91]Should I do?
[28:40.69]I'm not confident with Iron Giant, but whatever.
[28:42.57]I'll get beat up.
[28:45.27]Classic?
[28:56.06]You're like a child on Christmas morning.
[29:02.16]I've been waiting to get back into this for at least a month or two since it was last year.
[29:08.14]I'm so excited.
[29:18.90]Iron Giant is a good movie.
[29:20.62]Iron Giant is a good movie.
[29:22.06]I agree.
[29:22.40]Alright, Harley Quinn.
[29:23.28]I'll see how annoying I can be with this character.
[29:34.39]Let's do it.
[29:35.13]Alright, I gotta lock in for this one.
[29:41.31]Two ring outs.
[29:43.01]We're going for one right off the bat immediately.
[29:44.53]I'm going to go for a crazy play here.
[29:45.59]Watch this.
[30:07.99]What's on me?
[30:08.43]I got like a bomb on me.
[30:30.71]It's alright, it's alright.
[30:55.48]I'm getting styled on right now.
[31:06.94]It's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
[31:40.71]I gotta learn how to do some of these moves.
[31:54.14]No, that was a good fight.
[31:59.33]That second heat there... I got absolutely styled on.
[32:03.49]I got destroyed.
[32:06.35]You didn't use your shield one time.
[32:11.60]Should I try to do Taz?
[32:15.03]No, we'll go in 1v1 box.
[32:21.41]The earwig in your brain is getting to you right now.
[32:28.49]Do a Taz impression?
[32:30.27]Not on a sponsor stream.
[32:34.16]Whatever, why not?
[32:39.00]What?
[32:49.95]I was just about to- Okay, Taz Mania was just about to do that.
[32:54.33]And somebody, like, Hitman style, like, put a fucking piano wire on his neck.
[33:03.34]What was that?
[33:04.16]What was that?
[33:06.10]I was like- Prepare yourself!
[33:14.74]Alright, let's go.
[33:15.42]Mane versus Mane.
[33:16.66]You got your Harley Quinn, I've got my Bugs.
[33:29.71]Oh, best out of three.
[33:30.34]Let's do it.
[33:32.43]Both earbuds in.
[33:33.11]I'm going hard here.
[34:14.54]Coming for you now.
[34:48.43]I figured she was going to jump over me.
[34:50.82]So I was like, you know what?
[34:51.56]I'm going to keep up a fall on the other direction.
[34:55.12]Figured that was going to happen.
[34:58.20]Good job.
[34:58.58]Good fight.
[34:59.04]Good fight.
[35:08.49]Read like a book.
[35:16.21]I almost did my starter mission, guys.
[35:21.18]Why did you take your smart pills today?
[35:26.88]I think a lot of you might be concerned that I like a video game.
[35:34.10]And I might be kind of good at it.
[35:43.23]I'm really not, though.
[35:50.68]I'm just excited.
[35:53.40]Alright, Superman's good.
[35:57.77]Oh, wait, I have perks, don't I?
[36:00.09]Can I put them on right here?
[36:04.35]You ate your Flintstone vitamins?
[36:14.66]I mean, I had vitamins today.
[36:16.04]Maybe that helps.
[36:21.91]You're getting carried so hard by the earwig.
[36:24.31]The earwig is in control right now.
[36:31.99]I don't know what happened there.
[36:49.16]That was weird.
[36:58.65]Thought he was gonna jump.
[37:22.34]Oh shit!
[37:26.26]He's bringing it back!
[37:50.73]Oh, what?
[37:52.15]Nice recovery.
[37:52.91]Holy smokes.
[37:55.07]I forgot how to play a video game.
[37:56.45]I forgot how to play.
[37:57.09]I forgot how to play.
[37:57.67]I'm alright.
[37:57.99]I'm good.
[37:58.23]I'm good.
[37:58.63]I forgot how to play.
[37:59.17]I forgot how to play.
[38:02.06]Okay.
[38:02.26]Now I'm mad.
[38:43.46]I forgot how to play the game.
[38:48.14]I didn't wear a taunt?
[38:51.08]What?
[39:34.46]What the hell are you doing?
[39:40.83]What happened?
[39:50.73]Alright.
[39:52.03]I gotta dig down into... That was a good fight.
[39:53.93]Let's do it again.
[39:57.99]Paid actor.
[40:03.92]Paid actor.
[40:06.18]He probably dropped his controller on the ground.
[40:15.62]Whoever that is, they're probably screaming.
[40:18.26]Because they had me.
[40:19.14]They had me right where they wanted me.
[40:20.38]And they probably dropped their controller and it probably smashed on the ground and they grabbed it really quick.
[40:27.82]I have to stick with bugs.
[40:29.47]This guy's got a pretty good Superman.
[40:39.61]Alright, hold on, wait.
[40:44.03]I guess I'll just put these on, right?
[40:47.42]That's all I have.
[40:50.02]Paid actor.
[40:52.56]The mods are having a lot of fun over here.
[40:56.06]They're saying the other guy's earwig died.
[41:06.07]Same person?
[41:06.55]Yeah, that was a good match.
[41:08.98]Alright, let's go.
[41:09.62]Alright, I got my coffee.
[41:13.45]I got my controller.
[41:14.29]I'm ready.
[41:15.61]I'll beat you.
[41:16.79]And I'll defeat you.
[42:30.43]What's happening?
[42:31.11]My earwig is fucking having trouble.
[42:33.34]My earwig is pressing a bunch of buttons in my brain.
[42:35.80]Stop pressing the button that wants me to go get a pizza.
[42:40.74]Match point.

[44:10.80]Because I'm in the game!
[44:14.56]Paid earwig.
[44:21.27]Lightning's going through my body.
[44:26.21]No, it's not paid earwig.

[48:37.08]There's not been one match, one single match this whole time that has felt off.
[48:47.58]This is a breath of fresh air.
[48:49.03]It truly is.
[48:50.05]It's been like 10 to 15 matches.

[63:51.13]If we're gonna play together, I want no talking.
[63:55.73]We silently sit in a call, and I clear my throat every four to five seconds.
[64:00.03]Do you accept those terms?
[64:12.66]I just stare.
[64:18.57]Alright, Tasmanian Devil.
[64:20.39]I think I remember some of the stuff about Tas.

[68:31.82]Oh, we got this then.
[68:33.46]Oh, we got this then.
[68:47.05]It's calling me right now.
[68:51.89]Hello?
[68:52.59]What's up?
[68:53.99]Oh my God.
[68:55.37]I'm a Jermaniac.
[68:57.03]And this is a very special moment for me.
[68:58.48]I'm just letting you know.
[69:00.62]You want to do 1v1?
[69:03.06]Is that what you call your fanbase?
[69:04.14]Are they Jermaniacs?
[69:04.98]No, you got it wrong.
[69:06.86]You got it wrong.
[69:07.38]It's alright.
[69:08.68]What do you call your fanbase?
[69:10.52]It's the Jermamites.
[69:12.20]It's the Jermamites?
[69:13.22]Yeah.
[69:13.76]I don't have a cool name like that.
[69:14.92]Mine are Hasanabi heads.
[69:19.00]I just joined a game.
[69:21.30]Let me style on somebody real quick.
[69:23.80]Okay.
[69:24.48]I don't know how to play this game at all, so you are going to destroy me if we 1v1.
[69:28.90]Oh, then, okay.
[69:30.32]Well, I'll go easy.
[69:31.50]I'll play a character I don't play.
[69:34.00]We can do 2v2.
[69:35.06]Can we, like, pair up and, like, beat on other people and then you carry me?
[69:39.49]I mean, I'm not very good at this game either.
[69:41.75]I'm just, you know, I've dabbled a little.
[69:44.79]I think you're being modest.
[69:46.15]No, we're going to get absolutely shit on if we do this together.
[69:48.58]did you ask your parents before turning on mature language uh yeah okay good I didn't I'm being a bad boy right now alright are you are you watching my stream right now watch watch me watch me dunk on this superman ready check this out okay let's do it hold on hold on I'm pulling you up right now I'm pulling you up this is a test though this is like a trial to see how good you are
[70:20.58]Is that communist Superman?
[70:23.86]Is that?
[70:24.28]It's Superman.
[70:26.14]Is he red?
[70:26.59]Oh, he is red.
[70:32.83]Oh, you distracted me.
[70:34.15]You distracted me.
[70:34.75]You distracted me.
[71:03.74]Hey, what happened?
[71:17.63]Don't you dare.
[71:19.91]Oh, I should have ended it right there.
[71:21.11]That was stupid.
[71:21.65]Alright, everybody quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.
[71:26.58]Quiet, quiet, quiet.
[71:53.73]You like that?

[72:02.92]Oh my fuck.
[72:03.86]It's alright.
[72:04.18]It's alright.
[72:05.20]It's alright.
[72:10.18]Did I just turn the stream off?
[72:11.83]Hello, can you hear me?
[72:12.55]Your stream was on, so I deafened.
[72:16.17]Okay, so what happened there?
[72:19.89]You want to do a little post-game analysis there?
[72:21.85]What went wrong?
[72:22.99]Alright, so what went wrong is I'm suffering from a little bit of gamer fatigue.
[72:26.49]It's 125 degrees in my room, and Superman is overpowered.
[72:30.09]He's got a bunch of powerful moves, and I tried to juggle, but look at the thermometer above here.
[72:38.10]It's 140 degrees in here.
[72:40.22]That's what happened.
[72:41.76]It's just too hot in here.
[72:43.50]Yeah.
[72:44.58]It seems like you're making... Excuse me.
[72:47.60]It seems like you are failing on the front of... The phrase is just the game is such a weak mindset, Jerma.
[72:53.76]I had it.
[72:54.34]I had it in the bag.
[72:55.26]I really did.
[72:55.94]I swear.
[72:56.24]You are okay with what happened.
[72:57.96]Losing imperfection of a craft.
[72:59.46]When you stop getting angry after losing, you've lost twice.
[73:03.00]There's always something to learn and always room for improvement.
[73:06.30]Dude, I get angry at every little thing in the world.
[73:09.84]If the toilet paper has no toilet paper on it, in a rage, I grab the cardboard and just crush it.
[73:16.42]You have no idea what I was referencing just there, do you?
[73:20.00]Well, you said getting angry twice is bad, right?
[73:22.80]No, I said the phrase is just the game is such a weird- I was just reading a ninja tweet.
[73:26.44]Oh.
[73:28.76]I don't know any of this shit.
[73:29.94]I don't know anything about anybody.
[73:32.19]Okay, well, it's all good.
[73:34.47]It's all good.
[73:35.25]Okay, let me ask you- I thought you were helping me through that.
[73:37.79]I thought you were like- Are you playing with a controller or a keyboard and mouse?
[73:40.07]Because you- Why would you play with a keyboard and mouse?
[73:42.90]I don't know.
[73:43.46]Some people are sweaty like that.
[73:45.52]But the reason why I ask you is because like I'm really bad and I've never... I'm... I need your advice on this.
[73:52.14]You have an Xbox controller?
[73:53.70]Yeah.
[73:55.90]Okay.
[73:56.28]Xbox?
[73:56.86]I'm trying to do a forward air special currently.
[73:59.46]Or wait, a down air special.
[74:01.02]Okay.
[74:01.58]I'm doing the tutorial and I lost doing the tutorial at first.
[74:05.19]You lost in the tutorial?
[74:06.87]I died during the tutorial.
[74:08.69]I mean, it's a hard game.
[74:10.15]It's like a fighting game.
[74:11.27]Have you played a lot of Smash?
[74:14.63]Okay.
[74:15.93]I've never played Smash, no.
[74:17.77]I've literally never played.
[74:19.37]Really?
[74:19.77]So this is going to be hard to explain some things then, yeah.
[74:23.01]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[74:23.88]I'm like legit worried about this, but it'll be alright.
[74:27.24]With you by my side, I think I have all of the necessary tools.
[74:33.18]Okay.
[74:33.66]So how do I add you as a friend here?
[74:37.04]Oh, I don't know.
[74:37.82]Hold on.
[74:38.12]Let's figure that out real quick.
[74:40.55]I don't want to show your... Do you care about getting your name shown?
[74:42.89]Do you have the notifications turned off?
[74:44.15]Turn them off if you don't.
[74:47.07]I don't know.
[74:48.47]On what?
[74:49.31]On the actual Multiversus client.
[74:54.23]No.
[74:55.09]I don't even know if I have it on right now.
[74:57.99]Is that how we're... Multiversus client is what?
[75:00.78]It's WB Games?
[75:03.08]yeah just just like uh in your settings just make sure you have your like invite notifications off because when they see it they're gonna go you know you're gonna get pinged alright let's do it alright so I'm gonna do that right now manage okay here we go what is your invite from friends only no I'm just gonna have it open for now so what's your I'll tell you what my username is I think you can find me that way okay right I don't even know where to find uh friends though
[75:29.15]I can add you.
[75:30.33]In the top right, there's like a tab menu.
[75:32.03]You open that up.
[75:33.19]It shows you who you played with, who you're friends with, and your online Steam friends and all that stuff.
[75:37.35]Oh, we can do it through Steam, right?
[75:39.65]We probably can just do it through WB.
[75:43.26]Okay, let's do it through WB then.
[75:44.76]What's your in-game name in the MultiVersus?
[75:48.96]I just wrote it in the Discord chat.
[75:50.64]Oh, okay.
[75:51.84]I think that's what it is in my WB.
[75:54.38]That's what it is.
[75:55.96]I hope this is right.
[75:58.93]I think so.
[75:59.79]Let's see if that's you.
[76:01.09]You have open invites?
[76:03.03]Yeah.
[76:04.23]Okay.
[76:06.07]I just invited you to a party.
[76:07.45]Did you get it?
[76:07.81]Hold on.
[76:10.33]I have a weird name.
[76:11.50]It's like... Wait, 2v2?
[76:14.48]I think we can... I think... Are we going to do 2v2?
[76:18.22]Wait, we're just going right in.
[76:19.98]I mean, you invited me for a 2v2, right?
[76:22.22]That's what you invited me for.
[76:23.44]Oh, I just... I kind of... I just invited you to a party.
[76:27.27]It just said... I mean, your name is about to show up.
[76:29.99]I'm just letting you know.
[76:31.79]Oh, it doesn't matter.
[76:32.71]It's alright.
[76:33.97]Okay.
[76:35.65]You're this, right?
[76:36.81]You're Shaggy, just like I am?
[76:38.77]Yeah, yeah.
[76:40.19]I play Bugs Bunny.
[76:41.05]I'm a Bugs Bunny player.
[76:41.99]I've got a lot of experience playing Bugs or Taz.
[76:44.83]Okay.
[76:46.59]My character selection process oftentimes revolves around who I think is the coolest looking character.
[76:51.09]Who do you think?
[76:53.91]Bugs Bunny.
[76:55.22]We're gonna do dual bugs?
[76:56.48]We could, but we're gonna... No, no, no, no, no.
[76:58.70]Expert?
[76:59.50]Oh, no.
[76:59.88]Iron Giant is expert?
[77:01.13]No, Iron Giant is actually... Iron Giant's good.
[77:04.25]Really, really heavy.
[77:05.13]Really, really hard to knock off the stage.
[77:06.35]I would recommend it.
[77:08.45]Dude, just press every face button.
[77:12.06]Like, just mash buttons.
[77:12.84]You'll be alright.
[77:14.84]Wait, I have a ticket?
[77:15.96]Okay, I unlocked them.
[77:18.56]Wait, you got in trouble?
[77:19.16]Why do you have, like, a ticket?
[77:19.95]You have a ticket, like, in the game?
[77:21.79]No, like, I unlocked him with a face ticket or something.
[77:24.35]That's what it said.
[77:25.13]Oh, it's like, oh, I got a ticket.
[77:27.71]Alright.
[77:28.27]Iron Giant Classic.
[77:29.63]No, let's go with the default.
[77:30.73]Look.
[77:31.19]Okay.
[77:31.89]I'm ready to go.
[77:33.35]We're going to get annihilated.
[77:37.92]Do I wait in lab?
[77:39.60]I don't know.
[77:40.50]Yeah, it's 2v2.
[77:40.94]Are you ready?
[77:41.42]This is baptism by fire, man.
[77:43.60]Are you ready?
[77:44.70]Dude, I'm so ready.
[77:45.80]I don't even know what the buttons do, but I'm ready.
[77:50.13]Alright, so what do you have for a controller?
[77:53.07]I have a PS5 controller.
[77:55.29]Okay, so square is your kind of regular attack.
[77:59.18]If you hold square and not move, you'll do a power charge, and that's a big power charge move.
[78:04.68]If you hold up and X, or shit, square.
[78:07.32]Wait, do you have perks, by the way?
[78:11.78]Yeah, you gotta level the character up first.
[78:13.85]Oh, damn.
[78:14.87]Have you leveled your character up already?
[78:17.39]Level seven.
[78:18.01]I played for like an hour, hour and a half.
[78:20.82]Damn, you're so good, dude.
[78:23.82]I'm telling you, you're gonna like this game.
[78:26.62]Okay.
[78:27.76]So all you gotta do is just get in front of them and... This person has something here.
[78:31.18]What is this?
[78:31.46]They have all the perks.
[78:32.46]This one has... The Velma has all the perks.
[78:35.18]Deadshot painted target.
[78:37.74]Okay.
[78:38.90]The coconut mint's coming up for this one, Hasan.
[78:42.15]Okay, just tell me what buttons to press and I'm going to press them.
[78:45.33]You're going to be pressing triangle and directions and square and directions.
[78:50.40]Up and triangle is a recovery move.
[78:52.16]If you fall off the stage, why am I talking into the camera like you're here?
[78:56.70]It is like I'm here.
[78:58.34]Let's go!
[79:01.90]Oh my god!
[79:07.15]Just stay in the way.
[79:08.39]Yeah, he's really good.
[79:14.23]Just don't fall off stage.
[79:15.49]Yep, you're good.
[79:20.92]You know what's awesome?
[79:22.22]I get to be the big brother in this scenario.
[79:23.96]This is the first time I've ever experienced something like this.
[79:27.12]You don't want your number to be higher.
[79:30.52]You want to stay low.
[79:50.39]Oh, hundred and seven hundred and ten.
[79:51.99]Oh my god.
[79:52.49]Am I kicking ass or what?
[79:53.71]Yeah.
[80:02.12]Good.
[80:02.76]Oh my god, Hasan.
[80:03.66]That was actually perfect.
[80:04.98]We freaking did it, man.
[80:06.66]That was actually perfect.
[80:07.64]I swear to god.
[80:08.33]Oh, no.
[80:09.87]No, no, no.
[80:10.93]Don't push me.
[80:11.49]Don't push me.
[80:15.15]We're gonna lead.
[80:17.27]Wait, I can pick them up?
[80:18.45]That's crazy.
[80:28.90]Let's go for the bully.
[80:46.16]They got armor too, so we can break through it.
[80:47.36]This music is crazy.
[80:48.38]It's like, it's getting me in the mood.
[80:50.18]Yeah.
[80:53.21]It has no business going this hard.
[80:54.89]Oh, shit.
[80:55.53]Oh, crap.
[80:56.45]Watch this.
[80:57.65]Goodbye.
[81:01.59]Where am I finding the cars to crumple them up?
[81:03.43]I don't know how you're still on the stage, but oh, there we go.
[81:05.68]You're on.
[81:06.14]Let's go.
[81:07.14]Okay, well, it's fine.
[81:08.14]I died once, but they've died multiple times, right?
[81:10.84]Yeah, we're good.
[81:18.70]get absolutely destroyed Velma where are your glasses Velma that's it oh is there a dance can I do it can I do a dance like
[81:38.36]Am I a gamer?
[81:39.78]Am I a gamer, chat?
[81:41.28]Yes!
[81:42.52]It's cool.
[81:42.86]I just wanted to impress you, Jerm.
[81:44.00]I was lying.
[81:44.54]I'm actually a professional gamer.
[81:46.12]I've played this game so many times.
[81:47.44]Have you actually played this a lot?
[81:49.04]What?
[81:49.36]No.
[81:50.04]No, dude.
[81:51.02]Should we rematch?
[81:51.76]No, right?
[81:52.42]No, why not?
[81:52.88]Let's do it again.
[81:54.06]I declined.
[81:56.08]We need someone better.
[81:57.62]Hey, they were good.
[81:59.86]They knocked us off the stage.
[82:05.19]That was a good showing.
[82:06.33]That's the first time you've ever played?
[82:07.49]I'm so fired up right now.
[82:08.29]You have no idea.
[82:10.93]You got drops on?
[82:12.73]Yes.
[82:13.89]Alright, same deal.
[82:18.83]So, yeah, Iron Giant... Okay, once you get to a certain... You fill this bar that he has underneath his health.
[82:24.96]If you hold triangle, you'll turn into kind of like a war machine.
[82:29.28]And you have other moves.
[82:32.61]They're pretty good.
[82:34.91]I'll be honest, I have no idea.
[82:40.68]I think that's how it works.
[82:42.58]I'll go Taz.
[82:48.52]Imagine not believing.
[82:49.79]Yeah.
[82:50.69]I mean, I didn't.
[82:51.39]I thought we were going to get destroyed, but we did pretty good.
[82:54.65]You know, you didn't believe in me, but more importantly, you didn't believe in yourself.
[83:01.11]No, I didn't.
[83:02.79]Are you going to get any more gamer quotes to me that I'm going to misunderstand?
[83:07.01]No, it's fine.
[83:07.73]That was the last one.
[83:08.45]I'm never doing that again.
[83:09.33]Do you have currency?
[83:11.93]I forget that you are my age or in my age group, and therefore these kind of things are impressive to Zoomers, but not to you.
[83:20.21]Not to an esteemed gentleman such as yourself.
[83:22.96]Are you 30?
[83:23.16]31?
[83:23.18]32?
[83:23.20]I'm about to be 31 on July 25th.
[83:24.14]Alright.
[83:24.40]Well, happy early birthday.
[83:30.78]Thank you.
[83:31.24]I'm going to go with Iron Giant again because it says expert, and I'm kind of an expert, I think.
[83:36.78]Right?
[83:37.56]He just gets in the way.
[83:38.52]He's just really in the way.
[83:40.44]Yeah.
[83:40.88]Oh, I don't have enough gold to unlock the variant.
[83:42.84]Okay, we'll just keep it with the default.
[83:44.20]Do you have any skins?
[83:46.98]Oh, how do we... Uh, no.
[83:48.06]Oh, wait, hold on.
[83:49.37]I got a perk.
[83:52.09]Might as well put it on.
[83:52.71]Alright, Batman and Shaggy.
[84:01.94]Do you have any perks or just... Probably not, right?
[84:04.04]No, I have no perks.
[84:05.50]This was literally the first match I've ever done.
[84:07.26]I didn't even finish the tutorial.
[84:09.23]Oh, wait, I do.
[84:09.71]Wait, do I have perks?
[84:11.91]I have a defensive perk, Boundless Energy.
[84:13.59]Now I have perks.
[84:15.21]You don't even... Well, you actually don't really need the tutorial.
[84:19.73]It's self... Okay, here's... Just don't fall off the stage.
[84:23.81]That's it.
[84:25.67]The higher your number is...
[84:28.16]the more you're going to travel when you get hit hard.
[84:32.32]So if you're at 200, 150, it's going to be easier to knock you off the stage.
[84:38.10]Just don't fall off the stage.
[84:39.26]That's the entire game.
[84:40.81]Okay, got it.
[84:41.37]That sounds really simple.
[84:43.25]I'm still going to mess it up probably, but I think the reason... Oh no, this stage has a hole in it.
[84:48.51]Oh, I'm so bad with holes.
[84:50.43]It's alright.
[84:51.41]There probably will be two.
[84:55.02]No, this guy's name is Noob Destroyer, isn't it?

[85:42.27]No.
[85:43.28]It's alright.
[85:43.82]We're good.
[85:47.04]Kick me off one time.

[86:52.63]Wait, what am I doing that you said be careful for?
[86:54.99]No, I'm talking about me out loud.
[86:57.57]It's anybody's game right now.
[86:58.47]Whoever falls off next is over.
[87:01.05]Oh, well, I'm close to falling off then.
[87:05.84]No!
[87:07.08]We got noob destroyed.
[87:08.08]Okay, we have to defeat them.
[87:09.20]We have to defeat them in the marketplace of ideas.
[87:11.06]That was so close.
[87:11.58]That was so close.
[87:15.48]Okay, I'm weak.
[87:17.03]I'm weak on this map.
[87:18.35]This map has a lot of holes in it.
[87:20.59]It's alright.
[87:21.05]And it's hard.
[87:21.95]They'll just take a look at this and they'll fucking go run.
[87:26.63]Wait, oh crap.
[87:27.35]I think I declined on accident.
[87:28.73]Damn it.
[87:30.15]I pressed X because I saw X. That was so close too.
[87:34.36]That was actually insanely close.
[87:38.16]We were down 3-1.
[87:38.76]Or 3-0.
[87:38.88]We pulled it back to 3-3.
[87:39.58]So don't worry.
[87:40.48]Just keep your chin up.
[87:46.56]Thank you.
[87:48.45]Taz is good.
[87:49.13]Let's get a learner to play.
[87:54.41]Sorry I failed you, Jerma.
[87:56.65]No, I got knocked off twice.
[87:57.93]Go back to bugs.
[88:02.20]Should I buy this thing?
[88:06.45]That's half the fun.
[88:08.27]I'm gonna do that in a little bit.
[88:11.17]Dude, I have this.
[88:11.73]Look at my skin.
[88:12.09]No damage control.
[88:12.75]No dumb mistakes.
[88:14.60]Oh, oh, oh.
[88:15.06]Chat's doing Gamba right now.
[88:16.76]Just play some damage control.
[88:17.78]No dumb mistakes.
[88:18.44]Get some good hits in and you'll win for sure.
[88:21.08]Yeah, all we gotta do is... Okay, they keep recommending Shaggy.
[88:26.29]I didn't like Shaggy.
[88:27.33]He was too slow for me.
[88:32.23]People say he's good.
[88:32.91]Darn it.
[88:36.78]Arya Stark, Expert, Assassin, Hyper, Game of Thrones.
[88:40.40]You know who is good?
[88:41.86]Superman is actually really good.
[88:43.14]When I said that he's got powerful moves, he's pretty easy to play.
[88:46.46]You just kind of have to float around and do the freeze breath of people.
[88:49.41]Alright, I'm unlocking Superman.
[88:51.63]Let's do it.
[88:52.15]Let's go.
[88:52.55]Yeah, Superman's good.
[88:53.55]I want communist Superman, though, like the red one.
[88:56.67]I'm sure it's available.
[88:59.03]Just use your unlockable ticket.
[89:02.84]I did.
[89:03.14]I just did.
[89:04.16]I'm ready to go.
[89:05.22]I'm Superman.
[89:05.94]So you're going to be communist Superman and I'm going to be like rich Bugs Bunny in the bathroom.
[89:09.60]Oh no, there's only one million Superman.
[89:12.59]I don't think I can unlock communist Superman yet.
[89:16.87]I'm rich Bugs Bunny in the bathrobe and you're going to be communist Superman?
[89:20.41]Yeah, it's a, yeah.
[89:21.87]Together we, you know.
[89:26.95]It's the duality, you know what I mean?
[89:29.76]I think we got it.
[89:32.28]Alright, so you're Superman.
[89:34.50]Movement speed... I'm gonna do defense stuff.
[89:42.45]I don't have any perks.
[89:44.69]If you start playing with the same character, you'll unlock stuff.
[89:50.36]So what we said, you had something to be at 4.30 or something?
[89:52.52]You had something going on?
[89:54.92]What?
[89:55.66]You said something about 4.30?
[89:57.06]I asked this guy's toes if he wanted to play with me because I found out that he was one of the people who was doing the hashtag ad.
[90:04.16]Which, by the way, this is a hashtag ad.
[90:05.56]I think I need to say the FTC thing.
[90:08.21]Is it in your title?
[90:10.33]Yeah, it is.
[90:10.77]Alright.
[90:13.27]This is an ad.
[90:14.03]Although the game is...
[90:18.82]Oh!

[90:20.02]Get absolutely destroyed, Garnet!
[90:23.36]Oh!
[90:25.26]Oh!
[90:26.34]Oh my god, I'm bouncing her off the walls, dude!
[90:28.60]What the fuck?
[90:29.38]Good.
[90:29.96]Good.
[90:30.14]You found your character.
[90:32.10]You found his character.
[90:37.11]Oh shit.
[90:37.83]Oh crap.
[90:38.43]Oh crap.
[90:39.05]Okay.
[90:39.25]Boom!
[90:39.51]Boom!
[90:43.65]Oh no!
[90:50.72]Oh, Bugs Bunny's a mage character, right?
[90:52.56]That's why it's got so many cool skills and stuff.
[90:55.21]Yeah, he's fun.
[91:00.39]Oh, I tossed their ass.
[91:05.61]Shit.
[91:07.25]Get out of here.
[91:07.99]Get out of here.
[91:08.79]See ya.
[91:11.29]Get out of here.
[91:12.79]Yeah, they're both down.
[91:15.15]They're about to get blown up.
[91:16.27]Watch your head.
[91:19.10]There it is.
[91:20.52]Good stuff.
[91:24.00]Oh, yeah.
[91:25.56]That was quite a line.
[91:28.86]No, nobody has any ults.
[91:33.72]Uh-oh.
[91:34.36]They bounced me off the platform, dude.
[91:37.77]Go ahead.
[91:38.65]I'm beating ass.
[91:39.31]I'm beating cheeks.
[91:39.87]I'm beating cheeks with the Superman.
[91:41.88]Did you feel old when they asked you how old you are in the beginning of the game and it only went up to 22?
[91:46.04]Yeah, what's up with that?
[91:47.86]Yeah, that was weird.
[91:48.77]Oh, no.
[91:49.43]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[91:50.61]Sorry.
[91:51.23]I'm going to come back harder and stronger with that one.
[92:04.35]Oh, they got speed up.
[92:05.05]What the hell?
[92:06.13]Don't matter.
[92:06.45]We got advantage.
[92:07.43]That doesn't matter.
[92:08.28]I will give you a faster ticket.
[92:13.16]Out of here.
[92:21.16]Match point.
[92:22.23]Let's go.
[92:22.73]Wait, what does that do?
[92:26.29]What does the star do?
[92:27.05]I don't know.
[92:32.86]Go for the stuff on Finn.
[92:36.69]It's alright, we got match point here.
[92:41.08]He's done.
[92:43.98]He's done, he's not gonna make it.
[92:44.98]Oh yeah, he did make it.
[92:50.56]Oh, just one hit and he's gone.
[92:52.35]He's one hit.
[92:53.31]There he goes.
[92:53.87]Let's go.
[92:55.13]Let's go.
[92:58.37]Dude, that was awesome.
[92:59.87]Dude, oh my God.
[93:00.65]Victory sounds so sweet.
[93:01.99]It feels so sweet.
[93:03.25]How fast can you clap?
[93:04.07]It feels so incredible.
[93:06.23]We are the greatest team.
[93:07.39]Can I hear a fast clap?
[93:08.95]How fast can you clap?
[93:13.15]Wait, I want to do a rematch.
[93:15.69]I am down to defeat weak people in the marketplace of ideas now.

[94:34.62]But they don't understand, like, you have gamer hands.
[94:36.46]You know what I mean?
[94:36.99]Like, the inside of my hand hurts a little bit from flexing so hard.
[94:41.53]Yeah.
[94:42.19]Sometimes my thumb, like, webs hurt.

[95:43.97]You turn people into turkeys.
[95:45.23]That's... I can't believe it.
[95:46.13]Wait, did I do that?
[95:46.75]No, I don't think I did.
[95:47.31]Yeah.
[95:47.73]Yeah, you did.
[95:48.13]He's got... I think that was a power-up, probably.
[95:50.17]No, that's a... You don't remember the Superman cartoon?
[95:54.08]He would do his, uh, his heat ray and they would turn into dinner?
[96:13.15]He's trouble now the people were playing bad or am I really good like I don't know what I think we just we're just Stringing it together.
[96:19.27]That's all We're good team chemistry Dude what is that?

[96:35.62]Oh my god, you make you we just playing well, but playing well.
[96:38.76]Oh
[96:39.83]Or you think we're just beating on 11 year olds, which by the way, they deserve it.
[96:45.05]Okay.
[96:45.41]If you come at the King, you best not miss.
[96:47.84]Okay.
[96:48.24]I don't care.
[96:49.00]These are equal opportunity hands that Superman has.
[96:53.72]I mean, what time is it?
[96:54.60]Isn't it?
[96:55.26]What's what's today?
[96:56.26]Tuesday at four 30.
[97:00.88]Oh, wait, I got an unlockable.
[97:01.86]Was it toast?
[97:05.32]Gold earned.
[97:06.08]I never... You know what's really... I don't know.
[97:08.17]This might be because I'm old, but I never know what the gold I earn... I don't know what any of this stuff is doing currently.
[97:14.86]I think you can use it to do... Oh, I have triple jump.
[97:18.02]Let's go.
[97:18.78]Okay.
[97:19.58]Dude, I have... Do you have the premium pass?
[97:22.71]I don't know.
[97:23.27]I might.
[97:25.23]Is that what we got with the unlock?
[97:27.51]Or no?
[97:29.21]Maybe.
[97:29.53]I think so.
[97:30.15]Because I hit the unlock button.
[97:32.05]If you go to your battle pass... Oh, I got hella gold.
[97:33.71]Wait, what am I... Oh my god.
[97:36.02]I didn't do any of the... I didn't realize that I had a bunch of gold from... And I have 2,500 Gleamium.
[97:44.42]Oh, we got to finish the starter missions.
[97:47.40]So you have to beat the tutorial, I think.
[97:49.78]Oh my god, there's a taunt.
[97:51.08]I'm unlocking this taunt.
[97:52.30]Oh my god, that's crazy.
[97:54.34]I can do push-ups with my one finger.
[97:57.37]Maybe I'll do Velma.
[97:58.67]Velma's fun.
[98:01.23]Oh, yeah, I do have these character tickets.
[98:02.63]That's right.
[98:06.43]Velma's interesting.
[98:07.71]She's got some fun moves.
[98:10.18]I unlocked an announcer pack, too.
[98:11.88]I don't know what that does, but... The guy kind of looks like you.
[98:21.36]General badges.
[98:22.36]I don't have a max character badge that I've unlocked, so... Okay, I don't have any general badges unlocked.
[98:35.83]Edit perks.
[98:37.07]I have triple jump.
[98:38.47]Dude, it's probably like 500 degrees in here.
[98:42.23]Do you not have AC?
[98:43.15]What's going on?
[98:43.87]I do, but I don't know.
[98:44.62]I just... I think I generate so much heat.
[98:48.22]Okay, I don't...
[98:50.75]I have Trump Tower Superman.
[98:53.15]What?
[98:53.55]How did you get that?
[98:55.33]One million.
[98:55.87]It's a variant.
[98:56.51]It's an epic variant.
[98:58.47]I think they gave it to me because I might be the best that they've ever seen.
[99:02.13]I'm getting a call from Warner Brothers Studios.
[99:03.95]They're saying I might be able to make it pro.
[99:06.80]Really?
[99:07.74]Yeah.
[99:08.36]It's crazy.
[99:09.70]They're on the line right now.
[99:12.66]That's actually a really cool skin.
[99:13.88]People are going to think you're really good at the game, so you're going to have to step it up here.
[99:22.11]You're gonna have to step it up.
[99:23.63]You don't have a gold skin and be bad at the game, so... Can we do 2v2 with other people?
[99:29.45]I don't know.
[99:32.46]Is that possible?
[99:34.18]Lyric is playing, too.
[99:35.26]We could get, like, Toast and Lyric and then do a 2v2.
[99:39.86]I mean, I would do it if people want to play.
[99:41.56]I mean, they'd whoop our asses, I think.
[99:43.02]I mean, I don't know how sweaty they are.
[99:47.97]How?
[99:49.25]I mean, people really haven't had access to the game in a while.
[99:52.05]I think everyone's kind of on the same playing field.
[99:56.83]Here we go.
[99:59.27]Toast is a sweat?
[100:00.13]That's what they're saying in the chat.
[100:02.46]And Lyric is a sweaty gamer, too.
[100:04.16]I think, like, they would probably destroy us.
[100:05.82]This is an all-Boomer team.
[100:06.98]You, me, Lyric, Toast.
[100:09.28]Everyone's a Boomer.
[100:10.00]But it's all old?
[100:10.54]I don't know how old Toast is.
[100:16.52]I mean, I am sweating.
[100:18.50]I wore a tank top specifically because I knew I was going to be heating up in here.
[100:22.46]Wearing tank tops is your thought, okay?
[100:28.36]B-F-E-4-R, the Elite Feared Goblin?
[100:32.82]What do they mean by that?
[100:35.08]What are they, like a clan?
[100:36.46]I think they're queuing.
[100:37.48]Well, we're queuing together.
[100:41.36]This almost was a mirror.
[100:42.32]Should it be a mirror?
[100:43.74]Oh, it's too late.
[100:49.90]I forget pretty much all of Velma's moves, but I'm going to try.
[100:53.37]I got you.
[100:53.99]I got you, King.
[100:54.95]I got you.
[100:55.53]Let's do it.
[101:03.85]I hope we don't get destroyed by this clan.
[101:06.15]I love this song.
[101:06.94]What song is this from?
[101:10.98]Let's do it.
[101:12.28]Wait, I thought you were golden.
[101:13.18]Why are you silver now?
[101:14.12]I'm gold.
[101:16.58]What?
[101:17.06]I am gold.
[101:17.62]What do you mean?
[101:18.10]You're not gold.
[101:20.46]You're like 1930s Superman, like black and white TV.
[101:25.85]No, I'm gold.
[101:26.57]On my screen, I'm gold.
[101:29.55]Oh, maybe it doesn't.
[101:30.33]I don't know.
[101:30.93]I'm confused.
[101:34.01]Oh, God.
[101:34.37]They're beating my ass off.
[101:36.81]Oh, God.
[101:37.30]Superman.
[101:37.94]Chill.
[101:38.42]Chill.
[101:39.04]Chill.
[101:39.82]No.
[101:40.74]No.
[101:41.18]I had triple jump.
[101:42.24]You just made me stinking mad.
[102:02.16]We're good.
[102:03.00]Wait, how do I pick up the power?
[102:04.14]Left trigger.
[102:10.64]No, don't die.
[102:11.46]Don't die on me.
[102:16.43]Yes.
[102:20.17]Nice.
[102:21.67]Oh, Superman, come on.
[102:25.41]Come on, Gwyn.
[102:26.83]Come on, Gwyn.
[102:28.01]Oh, God.
[102:28.47]Oh, he's beating my ass.
[102:29.55]He's beating my ass in the QRTs.
[102:34.34]What does this mean?
[102:35.36]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[102:36.94]Wait, what the fuck?
[102:37.66]Wait, wait, how?
[102:39.76]That's crazy that that happened.
[102:41.12]I don't know what I just did.
[102:44.50]Dude, what?
[102:45.42]Are we busted?
[102:46.26]Oh, I think I killed him.
[102:47.08]No, we're okay.
[102:47.92]Wait, how is he not dead yet?
[102:49.74]We're good.
[102:50.44]We're in the lead.
[102:51.46]Okay, let's try again.
[102:58.54]Fuck!
[102:58.76]Hey, they got gamer fatigue.
[102:59.82]We're good.
[103:11.16]Oh, God.
[103:11.57]It's alright.
[103:17.63]Match point.
[103:18.02]Match point.
[103:18.38]Let's get it.
[103:18.96]Oh, no.
[103:19.52]Enemy team advantage.
[103:42.98]Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[103:44.86]Superman.
[103:45.26]Bully Superman.
[103:45.92]Get Superman.
[103:46.48]Bully Superman.
[103:47.10]Get Superman.
[103:47.64]Bully Superman.
[103:48.42]Bully Superman.
[103:49.08]Bully Superman.
[103:49.96]This is tough.
[103:50.58]This is tough.
[103:51.02]These guys are good.
[104:11.07]Dude, we just gotta hit him one time!
[104:12.37]I got him!
[104:13.03]I got him!
[104:13.33]I got him!
[104:14.05]He's gone!
[104:14.43]He's gone!
[104:15.03]Oh, he's up!
[104:16.13]You got it!
[104:16.45]He's gone now!
[104:17.93]Let's go!
[104:18.49]Oh, we did it!
[104:19.45]We're good!
[104:19.75]Victory!
[104:21.25]Let's go!
[104:22.09]Let's go!
[104:22.61]Let's go!
[104:23.87]I choked.
[104:24.75]I choked.
[104:25.07]Oh, crap.
[104:28.68]Dude, I'm doing so many YouTube faces.
[104:29.82]Dude, why does this feel so good?
[104:30.98]I've never tasted the sweet nectar of victory before, Joe.
[104:35.76]I get owned so regularly.
[104:37.98]Normally.
[104:39.00]I know.
[104:39.28]Doesn't it feel great?
[104:40.94]I've never been good at a video game my whole life besides Elden Ring.
[104:43.64]And in real life, if somebody threw an axe at me, I would dodge it.
[104:47.12]Are you?
[104:47.54]Wow.
[104:47.98]Okay.
[104:50.20]I'm bad at video games, but if somebody swung an axe at me in real life, I would dodge it.
[104:56.05]Really?
[104:57.11]How are you so confident?
[104:59.63]Just trust me on that.
[105:01.25]Lyric just DM'd me.
[105:01.93]He said, yo, I'm down to group if you guys actually want to group.
[105:03.97]Not sure if Chad is trolling.
[105:06.39]Can we actually physically do it?
[105:08.21]I don't know.
[105:09.86]Can we do a 4Q?
[105:13.34]Wait, I have a new move.
[105:15.34]Oh, shit.
[105:21.58]I don't.
[105:22.04]I don't know why I'm not unlocking any new perks, honestly.
[105:25.02]I don't know what's going on.
[105:26.42]I think the game is basically saying, like, we don't want to give you more perks because you're already so cracked.
[105:32.51]You know what I mean?
[105:33.47]Yeah.
[105:34.49]No, I feel that.
[105:35.21]I do.
[105:36.43]I think you just have to get to, like, level 10, 20.
[105:40.17]I'm pretty sure the game is like, we notice that we don't want to hit you with a vac ban.
[105:45.19]We notice that you're too good for the game.
[105:47.28]We suspect that you might be cheating.
[105:49.32]No one is this good.
[105:50.16]Alright.
[105:52.66]Pencil's down on paper.
[105:53.54]Let's go.
[105:54.28]Uh-oh.
[105:55.58]I hate this map.
[105:56.82]Uh-oh.
[105:58.92]This map is complicated and confusing.
[106:00.64]I don't like it.
[106:01.56]Is that good?
[106:04.49]You want to catch them when they're on the top layer.
[106:14.08]Whoa, what the hell?
[106:15.22]Adventure Time is turning into a horse.
[106:17.30]Oh no.
[106:18.44]Wait, what the hell?
[106:22.60]No, no, no!
[106:24.52]No, no!
[106:25.04]Let's pull together, we're good.
[106:50.43]Ooh, that was a good hit.
[106:53.65]Uh, Superman kind of messes me up, though, because, like, I'm Superman, so when I see... Oh, I got him.
[106:57.94]I got his ass.
[106:58.72]When I'm Superman and I see another Superman, it freaks me out a little bit, you know what I mean?
[107:02.20]Yeah.
[107:03.24]It's weird seeing your own moves.
[107:05.08]Yeah.
[107:06.46]And he's got more perks than me.
[107:07.61]He's a Superman with more perks than me, so that makes it worse, you know what I mean?
[107:10.49]Oh, God, no!
[107:21.08]Jesus.
[107:21.66]We're good.
[107:24.57]We're good.

[109:40.63]Toast and Lyric are ready.
[109:42.39]Okay.
[109:42.67]How do we add them?
[109:43.17]We can do a 2v2.
[109:43.71]Do you think we're ready?
[109:44.87]Do you think we're ready for a 2v2?
[109:47.74]I think we could be ready for a 2v2, but we got to figure out how to do it.
[109:52.04]Okay.
[109:52.60]Let's see.
[109:53.84]What's the process here?
[109:56.62]Does it add to party?
[109:57.76]I just toasted them.
[109:58.54]They just toasted us.
[109:59.41]I don't know what that means, but...
[110:06.52]You did pretty good damage.
[110:09.04]Whoa.
[110:09.64]Thank you.
[110:10.16]I have an invite.
[110:11.34]Should I do this?
[110:12.82]From Disguised Toast.
[110:14.10]Is that actually Disguised Toast or is it an imposter?
[110:16.97]Is it a fake?
[110:18.63]Wait, what is happening?
[110:19.61]Oh, I'm hitting control on my... Oh, God.
[110:22.75]Is this a fake?
[110:24.27]Is this a fake or is this the right one?
[110:25.55]I don't know.
[110:26.93]Hold on.
[110:27.39]He said...
[110:29.06]Toast made a game.
[110:29.84]Him and I are in it.
[110:30.58]He's trying to add you guys.
[110:32.30]Oh, wait.
[110:33.73]I found lyrics.
[110:35.29]Oh, I think this is correct.
[110:39.05]Bro, I don't even know how to add people.
[110:40.61]Let me see.
[110:41.35]I think I can invite you.
[110:44.77]Okay.
[110:45.65]I got to confirm from Disguised Toast.
[110:47.11]I think that's him.
[110:48.02]Alright.
[110:48.48]I hope it's him.
[110:49.24]I hope it's him.
[110:52.20]Oh, yeah.
[110:52.84]This is it.
[110:53.26]This is true.
[110:53.70]This is them.
[110:55.16]Alright.
[110:55.56]So we got to be ready here.
[110:58.35]I don't have any friends.
[111:01.80]Once again, at the top of the hour, I'm going to run an ad or a one minute ad break here, but also reminder that this is an ad.
[111:09.54]We are playing a video game that is FTC requirement.
[111:18.83]Thank you to Warner Bros Interactive for sponsoring this stream.
[111:26.71]And also, the open beta is July 26 on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC with full cross-play and full cross-progression.
[111:34.38]Everything that you unlock during this period will stick with you all the way through early access and open beta.
[111:40.40]There you go.
[111:42.41]I did that joke a week ago.
[111:43.53]It's a good joke.
[111:44.19]It's fine.
[111:46.11]Alright, we... I was moving my lips.
[111:49.75]Oh.
[111:53.61]I texted another player and I unlocked a reward.
[111:56.90]So we got to actually bring your A game here because this is against other streamers.
[111:59.84]Bro, they're going to beat our ass.
[112:01.78]I'm going to be honest with you.
[112:02.88]I'm pretty sure.
[112:03.72]I mean, they're both sweaty as hell.
[112:05.22]They're sweat lords.
[112:06.06]So they're level nine.
[112:08.98]Dude, Lyric is already level nine with his Batman, dude.
[112:12.24]That's fucking bullshit.
[112:14.22]I'll just say it.
[112:14.90]I'll go ahead and say it.
[112:15.86]That's not cool.
[112:16.67]It's alright.
[112:17.09]We got it.
[112:25.68]Alright, I got perks.
[112:28.33]I have no perks.
[112:29.65]You're level 8 with the Bugs Bunny.
[112:30.83]Yeah, the fear of me having a skin I think is going to put some fear into their hearts.
[112:36.52]Yeah, me too.
[112:37.46]They're going to be like, whoa, that's gold Superman.
[112:40.32]Like, unheard of.
[112:41.65]You know, that sort of thing, I think.
[112:44.72]is what's going to happen.
[112:46.22]I'm very ready.
[112:46.84]Should we?
[112:47.26]Should we?
[112:47.60]Oh, shit.
[112:47.98]I should add them in the Discord call, too.
[112:50.14]Why did I not do that?
[112:51.16]Hold on.
[112:51.83]But we didn't want them to hear the strategies, though.
[112:54.63]No, no, it's fine.
[112:55.87]I think it'll be fine.
[112:58.23]Let's go.
[112:59.75]I'm adding them.
[113:01.89]They're playing... Wait, are they playing?
[113:05.47]I'm not.
[113:06.73]Why are we... Why can't nobody hit each other?
[113:09.67]What's going on?
[113:10.07]Alright, we're good.
[113:10.53]I don't know.
[113:12.14]I just added them into the Discord call, which is a tactic I was doing, but they didn't fall for it, Jerma.
[113:17.08]The classic Discord call before the game tactic, but I thought it was foolproof, but turns out it's not.
[113:23.18]You know what I mean?
[113:23.66]I'm just going to be quiet and play because I want to win.
[113:29.53]I've got this.
[113:33.54]Why am I weakened?
[113:34.55]Why am I weakened?
[113:35.93]No, my bones are broken.
[113:37.35]Batman broke my bones.
[113:38.47]Wait, what is he?
[113:39.03]He's always in a fucking... Just stay out of that cloud.
[113:45.11]No, his attacks are decayed.
[113:46.53]Wait, oh my god.
[113:47.99]Oh my god, Lyric is beating the doors off me, dude.
[113:51.56]I can't get him.
[113:52.10]He's a pro gamer.
[113:54.72]Just kidding.
[113:55.28]Haha, get fucked.
[113:57.06]Oh, dude, you're destroying this guy's pose.
[114:00.60]Trade, trade.
[114:11.66]No, no, no.
[114:12.64]Sorry.
[114:12.82]It's all good.
[114:13.26]Good.
[114:13.38]Good.
[114:13.80]Wait, how am I healing?
[114:19.60]He's up.
[114:19.88]He's up.
[114:20.26]Yo, let's go.
[114:21.28]Get one.
[114:22.58]Get fucked.
[114:23.56]Oh, that was nasty, dude.
[114:25.97]Oh.
[114:27.19]Oh, shit.
[114:28.05]I didn't know about the collapsing route.
[114:39.13]That's two.
[114:55.36]Oh, no!
[114:56.50]Oh, he body blocked me.
[115:00.40]No!
[115:05.37]No!
[115:10.81]No!
[115:11.43]No!
[115:15.80]Oh!
[115:16.70]Wait, how does he weaken me every time?
[115:19.08]Sorry.
[115:19.36]2v2, 2v2, 2v2.
[115:19.64]Hold together.
[115:30.43]I fucked up.
[115:31.57]I fucked up bad.
[115:32.77]I got stuck.
[115:34.03]You got it.
[115:34.44]It's fine.
[115:34.74]Don't worry about it.
[115:35.46]We got this.
[115:36.56]Don't feel discouraged.
[115:37.48]You got this, King.
[115:39.24]No!
[115:39.97]Oh my god, I almost fall.
[115:48.87]Nice!
[115:49.41]Wait, what?
[115:49.99]What happened?
[115:51.15]Wait, what happened?
[115:51.97]How did I... I don't know what happened.
[115:56.05]Okay, well, they didn't add that.
[115:57.09]They didn't get on the call.
[115:59.65]Too many calls.
[116:01.37]Did I stay too high or something?
[116:03.80]I think, yeah, I think you were too high.

[116:07.60]Okay, wait.

[116:09.32]Tell him to turn on the Discord or pick up the call.
[116:11.96]I called him.

[117:23.95]It said X3.
[117:24.59]I don't know what you're talking about.
[117:26.51]Why do I keep perspirating out of my hands?
[117:28.13]I don't have any perks.
[117:29.30]It's just fun.
[117:30.54]Okay.

[117:34.60]I think so.
[117:35.04]I know of Jerma, but first time playing.
[117:37.00]Same with you, Toast.
[117:37.84]Know of you, but you know.
[117:39.00]Don't be afraid to get behind my shield.
[117:40.91]Let's go for it.
[117:42.53]Alright.
[117:42.89]Let's see.
[117:43.35]Oh, I love this level.
[117:43.95]I like this music.
[117:44.61]This is my favorite music.
[117:45.51]Is this like a Hercules one or something?
[117:49.14]It's the Steven Universe song.
[117:50.34]Oh, okay.
[117:57.49]oh yeah get destroyed dude that's so much damage I know I love I love juggling with uh Batman how do you weaken do you know how that happens I think just some attacks depending on the character has weakened my x does weaken hits every time I hit what is this smoke cloud is that what is that if not cheating
[118:18.68]I don't know what it does to you guys.
[118:19.98]I just use it.
[118:20.76]How do you, uh, how do you, how do you enable cheats like that?
[118:24.17]Uh, you just need to have, you know, you need to know the devs now.
[118:26.77]It's a positive stream that you're hacking, which is fine, I guess, but... Oh, shit.
[118:33.45]You have to unlock it with the key they gave you.
[118:36.03]Oh, the cheats?
[118:37.07]Yep.
[118:37.41]I guess I missed it.
[118:39.09]Oh, wait.
[118:39.49]Oh, yeah.
[118:39.89]No, I didn't want to do it because I didn't want to... I'm just trying so hard.
[118:43.72]Says the guy with laser eyes.
[118:46.52]Yeah, well...
[118:48.51]You're the only one in the game that can fly.
[118:50.91]I need a contraption to fly.
[118:52.41]This is like a backyard turf.
[118:55.86]I think Wonder Woman can fly too, no?
[118:57.26]Oh, can she?
[119:00.40]So this is from Steven Universe?
[119:04.73]Yeah, this song is from Steven Universe.
[119:06.61]I was thinking, like, where is the song from?
[119:08.77]And I just remembered it is from Steven Universe.
[119:12.05]Oh my god, I caught that bomb.
[119:16.37]Dude, this is so good.
[119:17.37]When you juggle, it's like... I mean, when you get a string of combos, it's so stupid.
[119:22.39]Like that.
[119:22.83]That was silly.
[119:25.27]That's cheating, too.
[119:25.93]You have contraptions.
[119:26.71]That's literally cheating.
[119:27.79]Oh, it's a Remix.
[119:28.47]That's cool.
[119:30.98]It was a good dodge.
[119:33.44]That was a good dodge.
[119:36.46]Get out of here!
[119:37.58]Get out of here!
[119:38.84]I'm enraged!
[119:40.78]Where is she?
[119:41.90]Why are you blinking?
[119:45.32]I'm so mad at you.
[119:47.14]I'm so mad at you.
[119:48.10]I'm so mad.
[119:49.54]Oh, shit.
[119:51.12]Yeah, where's your kryptonite now, dude?
[119:52.92]Huh?
[119:53.12]Where's your kryptonite infused gauntlets, bitch?
[119:57.21]Oh, God.
[119:59.95]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[120:01.97]Oh, shit.
[120:03.27]Alright, you guys got to get out of here.
[120:05.33]Alright.
[120:07.01]Oh, no.
[120:08.67]Jerma, avenge me.
[120:10.25]You're good.
[120:10.71]You're good.
[120:10.99]I don't know why I'm talking like Batman, but...
[120:14.03]Hey, you know what a tactic K means, right?
[120:16.51]It means you're using your spam.
[120:18.31]You're a one hit.
[120:19.12]You're a one hit Andy.
[120:20.70]Oh, I thought you were talking to me.
[120:24.98]You just screwed my brain.
[120:27.06]I thought you called me a one hit Andy.
[120:28.68]I was like, wait, why are you saying that you're my team?
[120:31.46]Wait, I thought that was them.
[120:35.09]I'm sorry.
[120:35.63]I was like, wait, I'm the one at Andy.
[120:37.25]That was friendly fire.
[120:38.01]That was friendly fire.
[120:40.53]I'm just glad there's no shaggy mains in this lobby.
[120:42.93]He's okay.
[120:44.20]Wait, really?
[120:44.52]Is he?
[120:44.90]Is he actually low?
[120:46.37]Dude, I don't know.
[120:47.69]Oh, shit.
[120:48.29]Oh, no.
[120:48.69]I fucking died.
[120:49.95]What?
[120:50.51]I fell.
[120:51.09]I was trying to do a cool thing, and I didn't do a cool thing.
[120:54.21]And instead, I did an uncool thing.
[121:01.13]No.
[121:03.71]No one can resist the lasso of truth.
[121:06.26]Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[121:07.64]Watch me.
[121:08.12]Watch me resist it.
[121:09.04]Oh, shit.
[121:11.62]How come you got Mr. B6?
[121:12.34]Get the fuck out of here.
[121:17.63]Oh, God.
[121:32.22]What?
[121:33.34]How is that even possible?
[121:35.54]How is that even possible?
[121:37.02]Oh, God.
[121:37.52]Toes.
[121:37.76]I'm trying to... Get his ass.
[121:39.56]Get his ass.
[121:39.94]Get his ass.
[121:40.38]Get his ass.

[122:11.93]Oh, my God.

[122:50.14]We were chasing you around, Toast.
[122:52.66]You were slippery.
[122:55.24]Yeah, I wonder why we lost, and then I look at how much damage I did, and it's 201.
[122:59.27]Hey, but you got the KOs.
[123:02.43]That's all that matters.
[123:04.55]Just wait until, like, the sweaty, really good players, they know how to use their supports and just, like, work together insanely.
[123:10.73]Oh, my God.
[123:12.37]Oh.
[123:13.38]completely different most of these characters just have those combo moves it's gonna be crazy people are not gonna fall off the stage I bet the dog is like low-key one of the best supports or something whoever that weird like dog with the stars with the pole right yeah yeah yeah the tutorial dog yeah if you utilize it that helps their partner and the dog has like two of them should we switch up teams
[123:44.71]I'm good this way.
[123:45.91]I'm good this way.
[123:46.51]I don't mind.
[123:46.87]I don't mind.
[123:47.23]We're going to get a dub.
[123:48.25]We're going to get a dub.
[123:48.99]We're going to get a dub.
[123:49.67]I'm not trying to be Jerma.
[123:51.46]You're not confident?
[123:52.70]No, no, no.
[123:54.56]I'm so confident.
[123:55.38]Dude, listen.
[123:56.70]You need to get lucky every game.
[123:58.50]He didn't even finish the tutorial.
[124:01.81]Oh, yeah, that's true.
[124:02.45]Oh, no.
[124:03.61]No, I've been... But I've been... But we've been clapping cheeks nonstop.
[124:06.97]We actually have been.
[124:07.61]This is the tutorial.
[124:09.28]Yeah.
[124:11.30]No, trial by fire, trial by combat.
[124:13.50]No, I respect that.
[124:14.70]I do the same shit, so... You just gotta throw yourself in and then figure it out when it's like... Gotta be in the midst.
[124:23.86]Have you guys tried the new Iron Giant character yet?
[124:26.82]Dude, oh no.
[124:27.50]He got Iron Giant.
[124:28.48]He knows our strategies.
[124:29.86]He knows our strategies.

[124:32.24]I versed him.
[124:32.88]He's sick.
[124:33.50]He's massive.
[124:34.57]This guy was stream sniping earlier, I think.
[124:38.43]What, an Iron Giant was?
[124:40.45]No, I was using... Wait, stream sniping in a game where we're all on the same stage?
[124:45.85]No, I'm saying he was stream sniping our earlier fights.
[124:48.46]He saw how I was slapping people with the Iron Giant.
[124:51.78]He was like, I should do that.
[124:54.18]wait can you do two of like can you do Batman Batman or only one person per team I think you can do whatever yeah do whatever I think you can do as many as you want you can have two V two all iron giants oh god he's so big oh my god bro iron giant literally like does not get hit I mean he doesn't he doesn't take damage

[125:25.99]No, he's incredibly tanky.
[125:29.05]Oh, what the fuck?
[125:30.65]Dude, how do I keep getting weakened, dude?
[125:33.31]It's my hits.
[125:34.37]My hits weaken you.
[125:34.87]This is the first time I've ever, like, gotten weakened.
[125:37.30]Like, you're... Is it the cheats?
[125:39.20]Is that what it is?
[125:39.80]Is it your cheats unlocked?
[125:41.32]It's the cheats, plus I think Batman's just... Every move weakens.
[125:45.34]I think that's just, like, his thing.
[125:46.68]Yeah, okay.
[125:47.36]That's cheating.
[125:48.42]I got it.
[125:49.00]No, that's what I was wondering.
[125:49.96]Is it, like, the cheats unlocked?
[125:51.06]He's really heavy.
[125:53.15]Oh, come on.
[125:55.31]After this, I'll give you the file to extract anywhere but your Steam directory.
[125:58.91]What is he doing?
[125:59.51]He's got bolts and shit?
[126:00.89]He can shoot those.
[126:06.36]Dude, they are beating the shit out of us, bro.
[126:09.00]Wait, what?
[126:09.38]What the fuck just happened?
[126:12.43]No, that's a double kill for use of the platform?
[126:17.47]We did not just get double killed off the platform, bro.
[126:19.77]Oh, we did.
[126:20.19]I'm so hurt.
[126:24.04]Save me, Iron.
[126:25.50]I'm going to hide behind him, dude.
[126:26.68]He's huge.
[126:27.50]Oh, shit.
[126:29.10]Wait, what the fuck?
[126:29.96]Oh, be careful.
[126:31.72]Oh, my God.
[126:33.02]We can't get four out.
[126:34.02]We can't get four out of this one.
[126:39.01]Yeah, this is all you, Toast.
[126:40.31]You're like a raid boss.
[126:41.57]Alright, we got him.
[126:42.43]We got him.
[126:44.08]It doesn't matter.
[126:44.86]He's so powerful.
[126:47.54]That's why I said the Iron meta.
[126:48.88]The Iron Giant meta is crazy.
[126:51.48]Everybody knows this.
[126:53.71]Please, don't season me, alright?
[126:55.41]I'm not food.
[126:57.15]You turn into a turkey if I get enough on you.
[126:59.97]Yeah, only sweaty boys get the Iron Giant meta.

[127:09.56]How is that even possible?
[127:11.20]I'm literally fucking body blocking you and you're just going up.
[127:14.12]You're tanking the hits.
[127:19.20]All you toast.

[127:38.54]Wait, why can't I hit you?
[127:39.68]We can pull this back.
[127:41.12]Do you have like a double health bar or something?
[127:43.88]What is that?
[127:44.96]Yeah, I can transport.
[127:50.97]Please.
[127:54.99]Oh, you're so heavy.

[128:16.84]Oh, God!

[128:26.20]That was close.
[128:26.70]We recovered.
[128:27.50]We recovered really well, and that's what matters.
[128:29.46]It's almost like winning.
[128:30.88]Dude, this guy, he probably has like 500 damage.
[128:35.42]Alright.
[128:36.64]That was just 317 damage.
[128:39.24]His hitbox is so big.

[129:54.42]True, true.
[129:56.64]This is going to be actually pretty interesting.
[130:00.27]There's going to be a bunch of nuts and bolts everywhere.
[130:09.32]Out of all of us, Toast knows exactly what he's doing.
[130:11.46]We're just going to be pressing buttons.
[130:13.28]You got to guide the way.
[130:14.26]Are you guys on keyboard or controller?
[130:16.92]Controller.
[130:18.04]Are you playing keyboard?
[130:19.06]I'm playing keyboard.
[130:19.98]What?
[130:20.73]No, you're not.
[130:22.29]Holy shit.
[130:23.75]Toast literally is unlocking shit that I didn't even know existed.
[130:26.69]I don't know how.
[130:28.25]He's got bolts on and shit.
[130:30.57]I'm already dead.
[130:32.29]Who cares about the attack delay?
[130:33.49]Just do down special.
[130:36.19]Oh, okay.
[130:38.30]Oh, this is actually kind of cool.
[130:44.16]Oh, that's so stupid.
[130:48.08]Get fucking destroyed, dude.
[130:49.90]Oh, my God.
[130:50.44]Oh, what the fuck?
[130:52.52]Oh, I survived.
[130:53.70]What?
[130:57.00]I got confused.
[130:57.84]I thought I was toast.
[130:59.64]Yeah, no, that is a problem.
[131:00.80]That is definitely a problem.
[131:04.22]Oh, you guys are both, are you guys both red?
[131:08.30]Yeah.
[131:08.66]That's very confusing.
[131:11.45]How'd you do the missiles?
[131:12.09]I swear I turned into like a Terminator.
[131:13.79]What was that?
[131:20.70]Wait, what am I doing?
[131:21.40]What am I?
[131:22.06]I'm a bolt guy now.
[131:23.04]I don't know how I did that.
[131:25.20]What does that do?
[131:25.82]I can bolt you?
[131:31.52]It's just the Rock'em Sock'em robots just fucking pissed off at each other.
[131:35.45]What does this do?
[131:37.33]Oh, I couldn't even try it.
[131:39.31]I'm sure you're like locked into one mode is this.
[131:42.09]Or move.
[131:46.13]Oh, come on!
[131:47.97]Oh my god!
[131:49.01]You destroyed me, dude.
[131:52.36]Whoa, whoa!
[131:53.54]Are you going to blow up?
[131:55.30]What's happening?
[131:57.62]I don't know.
[131:58.08]They were in a green sphere.
[131:59.60]I don't know what that was.
[132:05.90]How have I not fallen off yet?
[132:07.69]I think it's like his ammo he can shoot out.
[132:18.03]Oh, God damn it, dude.
[132:19.19]Fuck!
[132:19.69]Dude, that bug slam is ridiculous.
[132:21.87]That is so powerful!
[132:24.03]This game is so dumb!
[132:25.77]Oh, come on, come on.
[132:26.59]Are you fucking kidding me?
[132:27.94]Oh my God!
[132:31.90]That slam, bro.
[132:32.98]What was that scream?
[132:34.24]That was like somebody was pulling teeth out of your mouth.
[132:36.10]I'm sorry.
[132:36.56]I'm sorry.
[132:37.16]I died again.
[132:37.82]I died again.
[132:38.38]I'm fucking eating.
[132:39.49]I'm feeding.
[132:40.03]I'm feeding.
[132:40.61]I'm feeding.
[132:41.07]I don't like it.
[132:42.71]I'm sorry, Jeremiah.
[132:43.59]We're good.
[132:44.25]We're good.
[132:44.57]We're good.
[132:44.79]We're okay.
[132:45.55]We're okay.
[132:47.78]Bro, Toes is like literally fucking doing like... It's like playing... Oh, come on!
[132:53.32]It's like an entirely different game that Toes is playing than us, I think.
[132:56.60]He's like... I got like three fucking hits, three moves.
[132:59.72]Like, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[133:03.86]Protect friends.
[133:04.54]Oh, God.
[133:05.21]He's ledge guarding me.
[133:07.73]Yeah.
[133:08.15]I'm going to suck him up.
[133:09.05]I'm going to suck him up.
[133:09.61]Alright.
[133:11.05]Attack!
[133:11.45]I'm getting sucked.
[133:12.23]I'm getting sucked.
[133:19.90]Why are we all in slow motion?
[133:24.14]You deal with him while I deal with Toast.
[133:25.40]I deal with Toast, you deal with him.
[133:26.50]I'm going off the stage very quickly here.
[133:33.37]Oh, shit.
[133:33.91]What the fuck, dude?
[133:35.05]That thing is... What?
[133:36.75]What?
[133:37.27]How slow?
[133:38.23]I can't even bomb.
[133:41.16]Dude, that was an endless spam.
[133:43.04]I'm dead.
[133:43.46]I'm so dead.
[133:43.78]No, no, no.
[133:44.02]You're good.
[133:44.26]You're good.
[133:44.54]You're good.
[133:44.78]You're good.
[133:45.08]No, I'm dead.
[133:45.56]I'm dead.
[133:46.18]I'm dead.
[133:46.82]I'm so dead.
[133:47.78]I died.
[133:48.84]Oh, my God, dude.
[133:50.84]How?
[133:52.19]That is an unreasonable amount of stun lock.
[133:55.07]You definitely did like 700 damage.
[133:57.03]You guys are just defected models.
[133:58.95]How much did... Yeah, 556 damage.
[134:00.63]Are you kidding me?
[134:06.37]Alright.
[134:06.61]1v3.
[134:06.75]Alright.
[134:07.69]Toast, you're on your own team.
[134:08.97]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[134:10.07]Wait.
[134:10.29]Can you even do 1v3s?
[134:11.01]No, sorry.
[134:11.81]I don't think so.
[134:14.43]Oh, let's see.
[134:15.23]We can do a free-for-all.
[134:16.72]Wait.
[134:16.94]Who left?
[134:17.66]Oh, that sounds fun.
[134:18.82]Wait.
[134:19.00]Someone left?
[134:21.80]Autoparty request cancel or something?
[134:23.70]Oh, can you FFA?
[134:26.44]Yeah.
[134:26.80]Dude, you know what?
[134:27.50]I'm gonna try... Everybody's in right now.
[134:29.16]Whatever you want to do, I'm gonna try Shaggy, dude.
[134:31.14]I think Shaggy's the only one who can stop.
[134:34.95]You turned... You turned to the dark side, man.
[134:39.11]What... What does Shaggy have that's so good?
[134:43.35]He's fast.
[134:44.02]He's like a... He's a brawler, so he's all about just like pure damage.
[134:47.66]I don't think... He has like a sandwich he throws.
[134:49.50]Everything else is like melee kicks, like all fighting brawlers.
[134:53.58]Are you still... Are you still in Japan?
[134:55.66]Like where are you right now, Toad?
[134:57.22]Yeah.
[134:57.80]I'm in Kyoto right now.
[135:01.21]Damn.
[135:02.87]Yeah, I'm screaming.
[135:03.93]My man is... What time is it over there?
[135:05.51]You're joining?
[135:06.15]9 AM.
[135:08.77]So I started at 6 AM.
[135:10.89]Damn, yo.
[135:11.61]Gamer.
[135:12.71]Dude, it is so... Wait, it's 6 AM?
[135:14.55]Oh, wow.
[135:15.71]I wanted to potentially go to Korea, but I feel like the time zone difference is so severe.
[135:19.45]Do you try and keep your schedule all the time?
[135:25.62]I try to do it in England.
[135:28.07]Wait.
[135:28.35]Wait.
[135:29.17]Oh, you guys are trying different characters.
[135:30.85]Okay.
[135:31.39]This is the time to do it.
[135:32.25]Yeah.
[135:32.97]Yeah.
[135:33.19]Yeah.
[135:33.43]Yeah.
[135:33.85]All level ones.
[135:37.42]Man, nobody knows what's going on.
[135:38.26]JapanPing and still winning?
[135:39.36]Yeah.
[135:39.60]No.
[135:39.80]JapanPing is helping him actually.
[135:41.00]That's why he's still cracked.
[135:42.36]Yeah.
[135:44.06]Is this hosting off a toast or is this dedicated server?
[135:46.86]It doesn't feel laggy.
[135:49.96]I picked NA server.
[135:51.64]Oh, you can choose?
[135:52.54]Oh, okay.
[135:53.76]So, you're at the disadvantage.
[135:56.29]Or at the advantage.
[135:57.59]This game plays so well online, it really does.
[135:59.53]Yeah, it's just the Japan ping is helping him become unhittable, you know what I mean?
[136:05.26]Oh, wait, we're doing like a free-for-all?
[136:08.06]Free-for-all?
[136:08.68]Oh, okay.
[136:09.30]Any other video game, if you were playing from Japan and we were in North America, we would be literally teleporting ground screen.
[136:15.84]This is like actually crazy that we can play like this.
[136:19.60]Oh, come on, bro.
[136:20.32]Jerma, Jerma, come on.
[136:21.16]Don't hit me.

[150:03.57]Oh, shit.
[150:04.69]Wait, did you add?
[150:05.62]Wait, no, don't add Ludwig to the group, dude.
[150:07.34]Don't do that.
[150:08.10]What are you talking about?
[150:08.96]Why?
[150:09.20]I hate that guy.
[150:10.38]Why?
[150:10.62]What's wrong with you?
[150:11.66]I'm kidding, man.
[150:12.76]What are you talking about?
[150:14.54]Thanks for responding to my text message asking you to play video games together.
[150:17.86]Like, it's not a big deal, but...
[150:19.94]Uh, hey, here to play against you two.
[150:21.86]Hasan, I'm sorry.
[150:22.44]I just didn't think it was real.
[150:23.72]I thought you were hacked.
[150:25.16]Wait, what do you mean?
[150:27.05]I just couldn't believe that you were playing a video game.
[150:29.98]Hey, how is not having drops on YouTube?
[150:33.28]Is that cool?
[150:34.88]You don't speak to my teammate that way, no sir.
[150:37.43]How about we settle in the fucking ring, bro?
[150:40.09]Let's settle in the ring.
[150:40.91]No, no, no.
[150:41.49]No shot.
[150:42.09]You're like a fucking sweaty Smash player.
[150:44.81]And so is Charlie.
[150:46.17]We have to separate the teams.
[150:47.37]Hasan, Hasan.
[150:48.43]This is not Smash.
[150:49.47]This is multiverses, by the way.
[150:51.09]I know, but like, you know.
[150:53.13]They're different games is what you didn't recognize that Jerma did, idiot.
[150:57.91]By the way, we got my Bugs Bunny.
[151:00.01]We got your Superman.
[151:01.27]I've been working.
[151:02.19]I want a free-for-all, actually, against all of these pros.
[151:06.63]I've never played the game, and I'm playing on keyboard and mouse.
[151:09.69]Just play us and suck it up.
[151:14.78]How do we invite people?
[151:17.36]Oh, yeah.
[151:18.21]Write your usernames in there so I can invite you.
[151:20.97]My username is aircoots31.
[151:22.67]Okay, just write it because I don't know how to spell that.
[151:25.87]Nobody add me except for Hasan in Jerma.
[151:29.79]Okay, I have no idea how to... It's air, A-I-R... Okay, I'm just adding Moist, so... Oh, wait, we can do it off Steam, I think.
[151:40.00]I think it has to be WB name, yeah.
[151:42.58]Yeah, it's got to be in-game.
[151:44.00]In-game WB.
[151:45.92]Just one more time, that was aircoots31.
[151:48.19]No, I'm searching Moist and adding him.
[151:53.09]I don't know why everything you do is offensive, but it is.
[151:57.48]Moist, I sent you a request.
[152:00.28]Alright, alright.
[152:01.26]Are we doing free-for-all or are we doing 2v2?
[152:03.72]No, we're doing 2v2.
[152:04.42]No, no, let's do 2v2.
[152:05.22]What do you guys mean?
[152:08.57]Shaggy.
[152:09.31]Shaggy.
[152:09.63]Oh, I'm Shaggy.
[152:10.39]Oh, what?
[152:11.53]Oh, no.
[152:13.85]No.

[152:15.35]We've got three Shaggy players here.
[152:17.05]Three Shaggy players.
[152:18.29]I'll switch.
[152:20.04]Who's your second call?
[152:20.68]Okay, okay, okay.
[152:21.98]I am going to add Moist to the lobby.
[152:27.14]I'm doing it.
[152:27.86]I'm adding Moist to the lobby.
[152:29.20]Moist, you got a request?
[152:31.10]Mm-hmm.
[152:31.60]I'm coming, and then I'll bring in Ludwig.
[152:33.42]Okay.
[152:34.64]Oh, actually, he came with me.
[152:36.19]Are we both here?
[152:37.58]No, I'm not seeing him.
[152:38.54]Oh, you're right.
[152:42.42]Okay, I got him.
[152:44.53]You should play as the WB frog.
[152:46.17]Alright, the second they add that, that's my main for the rest of my life.
[152:50.39]Actually a great main.
[152:52.73]air coots 31 shocker was it hard to spell good come on what I don't know what you meant when you said air coots I thought it was like like er k ut like I don't know it could be so many different ways I don't know what the fuck air coots is I don't know why you make things difficult I'm sorry I did not realize that you you know have a named it after your cat which was also once on ogle money
[153:24.41]I want to drink like a 32 ounce Gatorade right now.
[153:27.99]Okay, let's do it.
[153:29.69]So bad.
[153:31.65]Are we ready to go?
[153:33.51]I'm ready.
[153:34.41]The gross orange one.
[153:35.75]Am I the one who's controlling?
[153:38.27]Am I the one who's controlling the lobby?
[153:40.79]No, no, no.
[153:42.21]Oh, shit.
[153:42.61]Okay.
[153:43.03]Are we good with this format?
[153:45.09]Yeah, this works.
[153:45.63]This will work.
[153:46.40]Alright, cool.
[153:46.94]Let's just do it.
[153:52.49]I used to, after soccer practice, suck down a Snapple in about three seconds.
[153:56.89]Oh, God.
[153:58.05]That's big.
[153:58.91]That's odd.
[153:59.31]What kind of Snapple?
[154:01.91]What kind of Snapple?
[154:03.77]There's like 500 flavors.
[154:06.53]Wait, there's like a main one.
[154:09.87]There's like the Snapple.
[154:12.47]Like Apple?
[154:14.54]Is that it?
[154:15.52]There's like a main... Like the original Snapple.
[154:18.67]I always thought it was kind of like... There was 12, 20 different flavors.
[154:23.18]I think there are, but... It's like...
[154:29.06]I think there are, but I think there's a main one.
[154:31.08]Is it Peach?
[154:32.52]I think it is Apple, right?
[154:33.82]It's in the name, isn't it?
[154:34.54]Wait, we have odds in the chat right now.
[154:37.26]Will AsanaGerma win?
[154:38.52]No has 9 million points, and Yes has 1 million.
[154:42.48]Or 10 million points now.
[154:44.44]I'd like it to be known in the alpha for this, I was ranked 1,000 in the top 1,000 across the whole game.
[154:50.83]I am going to shut my fucking mouth and try as hard as I can.
[154:55.79]Oh, I'm sweating.
[154:56.87]I'm actually out here to prove a point.
[155:00.33]Don't embarrass me.
[155:01.57]Don't embarrass me in front of drama, please.
[155:04.64]I'm in here with a bad attitude and something to prove, so I'm coming at you hot.
[155:09.38]Why?
[155:09.72]Dude, come on.
[155:10.40]I'm not a gamer.
[155:11.60]I have never played, and I'm on keyboard mouse, so I'm not feeling particularly confident.
[155:18.85]We're gonna get four-rowed.
[155:21.67]No, no, no.
[155:22.24]If we get one kill, it's a... Wait, he's already sandwiching it.
[155:25.86]He just jumped off the cliff.
[155:27.32]He just jumped off the cliff.
[155:29.58]Man, I'm back.
[155:31.85]I don't even know how that happened.
[155:33.35]I just got intimidated.
[155:34.27]Yeah, I'll do that to you.
[155:36.93]That's my hidden passive.
[155:45.17]Your other hidden passive is like looking like me and my boomer brain doesn't comprehend that.
[155:50.78]You know what I mean?
[155:51.76]God damn right.
[155:52.34]It's my camouflage.
[155:53.18]I'm just going to chill here for a while.
[155:58.96]You got this.
[156:00.72]God damn it.
[156:04.13]How did that not kill you?
[156:05.67]How did that not kill you?
[156:06.57]Shit.
[156:13.97]I just dodged.
[156:18.76]Are you guys going to do this again on the 25th or 26th?
[156:23.15]Yep.
[156:23.39]Yeah, yeah, 26th.
[156:27.99]Okay.
[156:28.27]Well, by then I'll practice and get so much better.
[156:30.81]Wait, can we?
[156:32.02]Oh, no!
[156:32.90]Bro, you haven't tackled once.
[156:36.12]Girma is so slippery, it's nuts.
[156:37.82]Oh, my God.
[156:39.80]I'm tossing Hassan like a rag doll out here.
[156:44.71]Yeah, it's just I can't hit women.
[156:46.65]That's why I just don't let him.
[156:51.16]Oh, my balloons.
[156:53.94]Oh, my gosh.
[156:54.46]Get the double.
[156:54.92]Get the double.
[156:55.34]Get the double.
[156:57.38]Jerma's nuts.
[156:59.23]Fuck.
[157:00.55]No.
[157:01.51]Oh, my God.
[157:04.71]I guess I'm not moving.
[157:09.91]What are you doing?
[157:10.81]What is that even doing?
[157:12.55]He was fucking with my brain.
[157:15.15]He was fucking with my brain.
[157:20.29]We're in a good spot here though.
[157:22.40]Oh shit.
[157:23.94]I thought I'd make things a little spicy.
[157:33.04]Good news, the fuse is lit.
[157:40.07]Oh, that safe thing is nasty.
[157:47.22]I love that safe, it's so fun.
[157:48.48]Come on!
[157:49.32]Oh my god, my tactic almost played off.
[157:58.39]Yo, we're good.
[157:59.33]We're good.
[158:00.27]There wasn't a problem.
[158:00.85]Was there a problem?
[158:01.39]Oh, I jumped away.
[158:02.33]Oh, that was so clutch.
[158:04.75]Oh, my God.
[158:05.62]I was fucking... Oh, my God.
[158:07.18]I was looking at Moist.
[158:08.50]What the fuck?
[158:09.72]I'm sorry, Jerma.
[158:11.54]Circus, baby.
[158:12.34]You clown.
[158:12.80]That's too fucking... Okay, okay.
[158:14.84]I died twice for no fucking reason.
[158:17.48]I died twice for no fucking reason.
[158:19.72]Still got more damage than air coots over there.
[158:22.21]Why did you say I got the least damage?
[158:23.61]I was wondering that.
[158:24.47]Is that... It's a known bug.
[158:26.55]Okay.
[158:27.61]that makes sense oh is that what it is yeah yeah yeah oh that's great oh yeah that's something with the mouse yeah yeah keyboard I'm gonna keep oh okay okay yeah because when you left click the inputs are the known bug is uh just being bad at playing games I'm playing Batman my main now prepare for my deck defying that's my boy hey son you still good on uh on shaggy or you're gonna walk off the stage another three times

[158:54.84]See, guys, we have something great, okay?
[158:57.75]You know what?
[158:58.03]I'm going to go with Iron Giant.
[158:59.11]Fuck it.
[159:02.43]I'm just kidding.
[159:03.13]I'm just kidding.
[159:04.55]He's not.
[159:05.35]You are bad, and you should quit.
[159:07.33]Yeah, I know I'm bad.
[159:08.37]I know I'm bad, okay?
[159:09.61]I'm very upset about it.
[159:12.27]Dormy shit.
[159:13.21]Jerm is very competitive, and you don't recognize that.
[159:16.16]I do recognize it.
[159:17.04]I've been trying to impress him this entire time.
[159:18.90]Like, I've literally, that's the only reason why I was doing alright.
[159:21.80]I'll be really completely upfront.
[159:24.28]Wait, can I go back?
[159:25.32]I want to try Superman again.
[159:27.34]Oh, we can't.
[159:28.43]We can't go back.
[159:31.33]I don't have any perks.
[159:32.65]He didn't even do the tutorial.
[159:34.77]And we dunked on... He's been playing actually really well.
[159:38.99]Thank you.
[159:40.45]Is that who you fought before?
[159:42.79]Yeah, but Toast was actually kind of cracked.
[159:44.35]And also, Japanese Bing saved him twice.
[159:48.13]Okay, one time it definitely saved him.
[159:49.77]Like, that's not even a joke.
[159:50.75]Like, we beat his ass, and then the game just delivered him the W for no reason.
[159:58.22]Is that a frog?
[159:58.82]What the hell was that?
[159:59.76]No, it's just what I thought of that statement, to be honest.
[160:03.39]Oh, okay.
[160:04.51]Okay.
[160:05.33]Okay.
[160:06.33]Alright.
[160:06.67]Let's pull together.
[160:07.27]Okay.
[160:08.17]I have no dog in this.
[160:08.99]I have no steak.
[160:09.79]Okay.
[160:10.05]I'm not good.
[160:10.79]I know I'm not good.
[160:16.21]Oh, my God.
[160:17.67]I'm not letting you up.
[160:24.07]Excuse me.
[160:25.33]Wait, why am I not able to hit you?
[160:27.12]That makes no sense.
[160:28.32]Oh, good grab.
[160:29.74]Good grab.
[160:30.28]Did you say Fire Giant?
[160:32.56]I hit the iron one.
[160:33.98]I said Fire Giant.
[160:37.56]Whoa.
[160:43.21]Don't worry, I'm dodging.
[160:45.41]Ooh, easy.
[160:46.95]That was nasty.
[160:47.99]The thing about me is I do nasty things only.
[160:54.00]Nice.
[160:54.44]Well, that was nice.
[160:57.58]Shit.
[160:59.48]Oh, what the fuck?
[161:04.32]Oh, God.
[161:13.60]If you were, like, one second sooner, Jerma, I wasn't dead.
[161:16.38]Why do you think I killed you, to be honest?
[161:22.90]Me?
[161:24.68]No.
[161:26.48]No, I was weak when you threw me.
[161:30.48]And you were in range.
[161:32.07]Ooh.
[161:37.29]Yikes.
[161:38.27]Oh, come on.
[161:38.91]I was on the screen still.
[161:41.24]Yeah, uh, how do you like that?
[161:42.96]The taste of defeat, I mean.
[161:45.35]We just need to work on Lud's recovery, I think, and we'll be golden.
[161:48.95]I don't even know what that means.
[161:50.01]Someone in the chat was saying that to me, and I have no idea what those words mean.
[161:53.31]Oh, watch out!
[161:53.87]It's on!
[161:54.03]Watch out!
[161:54.39]Why did that happen?
[161:56.61]Oh my god, I killed you.
[161:58.25]I'm so sorry.
[161:58.95]I put, oh my, I don't know how to explain that.
[162:00.74]Did you lift me?
[162:01.22]Is that what happened?
[162:01.98]Yeah, and you didn't move, and he killed you.
[162:03.84]You had like 50 seconds just to walk forward.
[162:09.86]Wait, is that?
[162:10.36]I don't even know what that was.
[162:11.87]I was just like flying.
[162:13.45]You were in slow motion.
[162:15.35]Dude, that was slow motion, man.
[162:17.73]That was so funny.
[162:19.57]The joint!
[162:20.01]The iron joint!
[162:20.71]The iron joint's got me!
[162:25.55]I have a shuriken.
[162:33.31]There we go.
[162:34.59]Wait, what?
[162:35.11]How did that?
[162:35.83]Oh, shit!
[162:37.21]What happened to you at the end?
[162:40.71]We needed that.
[162:42.31]No matchup knowledge doesn't gain plus ratio.
[162:45.03]Yeah, I don't know what I'm doing.
[162:46.21]I might say most damage to me.
[162:48.41]Dude, I didn't do any damage.
[162:50.11]It looks like the glitch got fixed because I'm not last this time.
[162:52.88]Oh, that's crazy that you outdid Drummer by one damage.
[162:58.92]It usually only lasts for one game, so it should be fine now, I think.
[163:03.10]I think you infected my computer, by the way.
[163:04.70]It's kind of annoying.
[163:05.84]It doesn't feel like that, huh?
[163:10.43]You guys have cleaned out the believers, okay?
[163:12.13]They're done.
[163:12.67]They do not believe in me any longer.
[163:15.20]Are you happy?
[163:16.38]No, no, I'm not.
[163:17.22]That doesn't make me feel good.
[163:18.40]Okay, good.
[163:19.86]Then go easy on me this round, okay?
[163:21.44]Alright, I'm playing... Oh, wait.
[163:23.14]Do I have enough for Finn?
[163:25.82]The streets still believe in you, I can confirm.
[163:27.82]Thank God.
[163:28.32]I should play Jake?
[163:32.20]Would I like Jake?
[163:32.90]Jake's pretty cool.
[163:34.86]Jake used to be kind of busted in the tech test.
[163:36.74]I don't know if he still is.
[163:38.04]What's Jake?
[163:39.68]You don't know Adventure Time?
[163:42.02]Oh, okay.
[163:45.28]Dude, you riding the rocket up to death is replaying in my head over and over again.
[163:51.82]I'm gonna be thinking about that all night.
[163:55.05]Yeah, it was kind of traumatic to witness, I'm not gonna lie.
[163:57.41]It just hurt my feelings, and he wasn't even on my team.
[164:01.60]He's just going, what's happening?
[164:03.58]What's happening?
[164:04.64]Just floating up to death.
[164:06.32]Yeah, I mean, you cooked me, but it's all good.
[164:09.74]Listen, they need all the advantages they can get.
[164:12.14]You know what I'm saying, Jerva?
[164:13.06]Like, we got it.
[164:14.54]Hey, you are golden Superman at this point, so we're good.
[164:19.36]These have been close games.
[164:20.46]I mean, we were on last stock.
[164:24.79]Alright, we're playing for real now.
[164:26.11]Let's do it.
[164:27.23]Yeah, yeah.
[164:29.46]No, no.
[164:30.04]The training wheels are off.
[164:32.96]I'm taking out the weights, the sandbags.
[164:42.75]This is a good song.
[164:46.13]Yeah, this is a good song.
[164:46.99]I love this song.
[164:49.95]Can you guys hear me?
[164:51.42]Yeah, there you are.
[164:57.65]Holy Lord.
[164:58.69]I'm getting absolutely slammed and jammed over here.
[165:03.41]My bombs aren't ready.
[165:08.36]I'm a better superhero than Batman.
[165:14.28]No, you're not!
[165:15.64]What are these coins?
[165:18.46]Oh, shit!
[165:22.70]Oh, I'm weakening the... the patootie out of these two.
[165:30.24]How do you do a finisher?
[165:32.60]I think it's only for certain players.
[165:35.42]Yeah.
[165:36.70]Some people actually have one.
[165:38.16]What the fuck, dude?
[165:39.66]What?
[165:40.00]Jesus!
[165:40.56]What is that, Jerma?
[165:45.75]Is that your finisher?
[165:47.09]It's called the Dornado.
[165:48.97]I'm enraged.
[165:50.89]Yeah!
[165:51.85]Oh, you snuck away.
[165:53.07]You snuck by that.
[165:54.79]Goddamn right, baby.
[165:55.79]My recovery's nasty.
[166:02.03]RECOVER THIS!
[166:06.37]I'll never find me here.
[166:07.55]Yo, he found me!
[166:15.74]Wait, how?
[166:19.51]That's fucking me!
[166:20.69]That was me!
[166:21.91]Out spacing, bro.
[166:25.97]I'm not gonna lie.
[166:26.80]It doesn't feel as good as he did back in the alpha.
[166:29.98]Give me the sandwich I'm warming up the fin Wait, what how does that even happen?
[166:44.11]I don't understand Like when I'm when I'm flying towards you sir with an attack.
[166:49.23]How does that not work?
[166:52.37]I
[166:54.86]Oh, dude, I don't know what spacing means, Ludd.
[166:58.08]You have a certain distance that your moves travel, and you're doing it too far away.
[167:03.60]How about that?
[167:04.48]Did I travel well?
[167:05.48]Did I travel well on that one?
[167:07.10]I'm starting to lag a little bit.
[167:10.66]Oh, come on, Gwyn.
[167:13.46]No, no.
[167:14.66]How is he still alive?
[167:15.52]I don't know.
[167:16.44]My up air is doing nothing.
[167:22.94]Dude blame the USB mini standard, okay the USB standard
[167:48.02]I'mma keep it a stack.
[167:49.36]Hasan, it was just superhero gap.
[167:52.60]Yeah.
[167:53.92]John!
[167:56.87]You were worse today.
[167:58.03]And that's just the facts.
[168:03.23]Only an amateur blames his tools, as they say.
[168:05.92]Dude, only a professional- Bro, I am not blaming anything.
[168:08.18]I don't know what happened.
[168:09.20]You're cheating.
[168:10.06]I am.
[168:10.32]I blame my fucking tools.
[168:12.42]That's how I feel.
[168:12.88]Jerma, you did great.
[168:14.84]Believe in yourself.
[168:15.93]The USB micro standard, the thing is like a toothpick that sticks in it.
[168:20.69]No, it's unbelievable.
[168:24.25]My controller unplugged itself and I walked off twice.
[168:29.83]It's just better tactics, I think, is what it boils down to.
[168:32.43]Oh, crap.
[168:38.52]Crap.

[168:45.31]Good call.
[168:46.35]Also, thank you, Warner Brothers, for sponsoring this stream.
[168:51.24]Absolutely.
[168:52.66]Damn.
[168:53.08]Lud, you're not even saying that ever, dude.
[168:54.94]What's going on?
[168:57.74]He's muted right now.
[168:58.88]I don't know.
[168:59.28]He's focusing.
[168:59.90]Yeah, he's muted.
[169:01.27]I think he's probably saying that right now.
[169:02.95]That's why.
[169:05.56]No, actually cool though, cross progression, cross play.
[169:08.55]Cross everything.
[169:09.65]That's cool.
[169:10.99]Boys, the plan is simple.
[169:13.07]We're gonna beat the doors off of Ludwig today.
[169:15.53]Nah, Lud's getting the hang of it now.
[169:19.77]He just needed like four matches to warm up.
[169:21.59]Now he's gonna go nuts.
[169:22.23]Dude, if I walk off the edge one more time, I'm gonna eat this controller.
[169:30.34]What's up, Super Doc?
[169:38.50]Oh, I can't believe I still hit Jerma.
[169:39.62]You make me sick.
[169:44.92]Dude, just wait till they add Daffy Duck.
[169:49.30]Oh, what the fuck?
[169:50.12]What are these gold coins doing?
[169:53.00]Is that your character?
[169:53.82]Is that Jay?
[169:55.30]Oh, what?
[169:56.46]Wait, did Jerma kill himself?
[169:57.34]Wait, did Jerma die again?
[169:58.66]My controller, USB standard.
[170:00.04]USB mini standard.
[170:04.11]We take that.
[170:13.30]oh my god you just styled on me that was kind of big yeah I got you with a nasty combo oh but you just repeat it I thought you're gonna grab the edging is trash right your spacing is trash
[170:44.53]Oh, and it was disgusting what you just did to me.
[170:47.69]Oh, it was disgusting.
[170:50.02]It was disgusting.
[170:51.38]I chased it down, baby.
[170:52.42]It's a blowout and I hate it.
[170:56.56]If Jerma's controller wasn't broken, you guys would be so dead.
[170:59.96]Not even funny.
[171:00.78]It would be sad how badly we'd be beating you.
[171:03.16]I'll keep it a stack.
[171:04.46]If Charlie teamed with Jerma, you would still lose.
[171:08.33]Wait, really?
[171:09.55]Well, yeah, you are the worst player on the map.
[171:13.33]No, it's new.
[171:14.15]And Charlie is the best.
[171:15.33]No, you.
[171:18.66]Good response, brother.
[171:21.52]You're bad.
[171:23.32]Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[171:26.66]I'm coming.
[171:27.00]Oh, God.
[171:30.88]What the fuck did I throw off the cliff for?
[171:34.22]Oh, I almost had you red.
[171:36.04]Oh, yeah.
[171:36.46]I'm terrified.
[171:37.52]I'm actually terrified of you right now because I don't want to lose the game.
[171:40.96]Oh, my.
[171:41.64]What?
[171:42.04]Wait, what?
[171:42.52]Why did I fall off?
[171:43.83]I fucking melted you, bro.
[171:46.01]No, you didn't.
[171:46.81]Jerma died.
[171:47.99]That's the same thing.
[171:49.85]It doesn't matter.
[171:50.57]You were fucking trash.
[171:51.99]Let's look at your damage.
[171:52.71]Look at your damage output.
[171:53.65]I'm going to Batman 2.
[171:54.61]It's over or something?
[171:55.66]It's better than you!
[171:58.82]It's better than you!
[172:02.01]I'm getting super glue and I'm super gluing this USB micro into this fucking controller.
[172:05.51]Charlie has 381 damage every match.
[172:07.01]He does have more than all of us combined.
[172:10.21]This is my shit.
[172:12.49]I'm just kind of nasty at these kind of games.
[172:14.75]I'm not going to lie.
[172:16.81]Okay.
[172:17.15]Okay.
[172:17.43]Okay.
[172:17.93]What do we... Let's do one more.
[172:21.35]One more 2v2.
[172:21.63]We've got to try to pull this back.
[172:24.71]Alright, one more 2v2.
[172:25.31]Then we can charge some freefs.
[172:27.23]Sounds good.
[172:31.83]I'm going to accidentally gorilla glue my hands to this controller.
[172:34.12]At some point, I have to 1v1 you, Hasan.
[172:37.04]Why is my... Oh, dude.
[172:38.66]I'm so down.
[172:39.54]I mean, you're going to be on the keyboard, right?
[172:41.34]Yeah.
[172:43.38]Okay, good.
[172:46.01]Hmm.
[172:46.51]I think I'm going to change it up here.
[172:48.43]I got you covered.
[172:50.27]Need I say more?
[172:54.91]Oh, man.
[173:02.75]Is it a bold move?
[173:04.17]I think so.
[173:04.81]We're playing as the... We get 20% more damage if we play with the same characters from the same universe.
[173:10.91]Oh, you're playing as Jake?
[173:13.37]Yeah.
[173:14.43]Oh, attaboy.
[173:15.41]Jake's good.
[173:16.82]I was just trying to mess with you.
[173:17.72]I'm not playing with Jake.
[173:19.52]Oh, you just lied.
[173:20.34]You told a lie?
[173:21.40]We're playing with the Mystery Machine group.
[173:24.04]Oh, that's kind of fucked up though to lie.
[173:25.40]Oh my god, okay.
[173:29.35]I'm a liar.
[173:29.83]I thought it was friendly.
[173:31.47]Do you guys know why my, when I alt tab, it's like sticks?
[173:41.14]Oh, are you in windowed full screen?
[173:44.86]No, when I alt tab, it just like shows all the fucking, instead of like showing it for a second for the duration of the alt tab, it just like...
[173:53.12]it just has all of my programs right there on screen are you playing in full screen mode or window mode I think I'm playing on never mind it's fine we'll figure it out alright let's see if we can pull this out here oh this is a good map I hate this map you press windows tab instead of all time
[174:25.58]tech button is it just dodge yeah just dodge oh man Jerm is slippery he's amazing
[174:40.39]Who is?
[174:40.71]They're the Velma.
[174:41.75]The Velma.
[174:42.05]The Shaggy shit.
[174:42.75]The Shaggy shit.
[174:43.79]Oh, that's really... That's weird.
[174:45.47]Who are you talking about?
[174:46.11]You say who's amazing on the Shaggy?
[174:47.73]That's crazy because you thought it was Jerma and you were complimenting Shaggy and now you realize it's me.
[174:52.74]No, I was saying it's really bad and cringe.
[174:56.68]That's so weird that you feel that way because... Oh my god.
[175:04.60]Guys, clip that.
[175:05.36]Clip that.
[175:05.70]Ludwig, professional Smash Bros.
[175:07.36]player, said that I was amazing on Shaggy.
[175:12.40]I'll take it.
[175:12.80]Oh, come on.
[175:24.77]Oh, how did you survive that?
[175:28.00]I don't know.
[175:28.46]I'm not gonna lie.
[175:29.21]I thought for sure I was dead.
[175:30.35]Why was she dodging everything?
[175:33.07]That's a double kill.
[175:34.09]What? What? What? What? What?
[175:52.58]Are we just OP because we're playing canonical characters like Velma?
[175:55.60]We're literally tied.
[175:56.90]20% more damage, dude.
[175:57.62]They don't know that.
[175:59.04]Same universe.
[176:01.00]They're in the same universe.
[176:01.98]Metropolis is always referenced in Gotham.
[176:03.92]Oh my god, Jerm is nasty on this Velma.
[176:24.85]Oh, I got to get that call in.
[176:26.21]Oh, shit.
[176:30.70]Oh, shit.
[176:31.76]That's basing.
[176:35.62]On target.
[176:39.49]Dude, you have dodged so many times.
[176:41.53]Go for it.
[176:42.27]I don't know how you keep avoiding.
[176:44.43]My body.
[176:45.81]Let's go.
[176:47.49]Let's fucking go.
[176:48.05]Every hole filled at the end.
[176:51.46]I could not recover on that.
[176:53.84]Jerma was poppin' for a minute.
[176:56.62]Dude, that was incredible, Jerma.
[176:58.16]For one minute.
[176:58.96]That was a clinic.
[177:00.74]Oh my god.
[177:01.33]Hey, come on, 2x75.
[177:01.97]That was a fucking clinic.
[177:03.49]Wait, Ludwig, I think your bug is back on.
[177:07.25]Yeah, I gotta just check it out real quick.
[177:12.21]Yeah, just check the forums real quick.
[177:13.41]I'm sure they have a solution.
[177:14.60]This game is fun, man.
[177:15.82]This game is fun.
[177:17.30]This is a lot of fun, yeah.
[177:18.68]Especially Victory, the sweet nectar.
[177:21.95]Oh, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.
[177:23.83]I, you know what?
[177:24.45]I don't... Wait, wait, wait.
[177:26.69]I gotta mention something here.
[177:28.01]Stop a yum, yum, yum.
[177:29.97]Okay.
[177:30.67]Will Jerma, will Hasan and Jerma win?
[177:32.87]Yes.
[177:33.59]Got fucking 4 million points and no 29 million.
[177:38.24]Ooh, that's a big believer moment.
[177:40.00]When was the last time you guys drank a Trenta from Starbucks?
[177:44.04]Never.
[177:44.34]I've actually never ordered one ever.
[177:46.72]I did one of those today.
[177:48.26]Never ordered what?
[177:50.20]You ordered one?
[177:51.30]This is like the secret large.
[177:54.01]It's 32 ounces.
[177:58.93]What did you order?
[178:00.39]It's a Trenta.
[178:05.11]I have no idea what that is.
[178:06.26]Okay, Starbucks has tall, grande, and venti, right?
[178:11.06]That's small, medium, large, but you can order a Trenta, and it's an extra large, a 32-ounce iced coffee.
[178:17.27]I love that.
[178:17.97]It's on the secret menu.
[178:19.42]What's your Starbucks order?
[178:21.34]Oh, bro.
[178:22.88]Trenta hazelnut iced coffee with three pumps.
[178:27.52]Wait, this is a lie.
[178:28.64]So Trenta iced coffee with three pumps of brown sugar syrup.
[178:33.96]With a splash of oat milk.
[178:35.84]That's insane.
[178:36.68]Splash of oat milk is good, though.
[178:38.36]Good call on that.
[178:39.06]Hey, Lud, are you having a hard time because there's no Jigglypuff in this game?
[178:42.58]Dude, just because you know a reference doesn't mean you need to say that a lot.
[178:47.95]Oh, I'm sorry.
[178:48.95]Are you upset that I fucking nailed you?
[178:51.61]It's okay.
[178:52.70]Alright, let's just put $5,000 on this one.
[178:54.02]Wait!
[178:54.34]Hold on, wait a minute.
[178:57.66]Dude, okay, dude.
[178:58.94]Wait, wait, you're on Taz?
[179:00.08]This is between you two.
[179:00.98]This is between you two.
[179:01.92]Never mind, never mind, never mind.
[179:02.60]He's on Taz.
[179:03.10]Never mind, never mind, never mind.
[179:04.02]By the way, people are freaking out.
[179:05.12]They think I... You get no sugar syrup in it.
[179:08.02]You only get three pumps of brown sugar syrup.
[179:11.10]Three pumps is standard.
[179:12.18]They put three pumps in a grande normally.
[179:13.90]We're playing friendly games and Luz is like, put $5,000 on.
[179:20.52]No, there's no classic in here.
[179:22.24]Excuse me.
[179:26.60]Alright, that's filming.
[179:29.36]I got this one.
[179:31.60]Oh my god, I didn't expect that.
[179:34.44]Oh, best song in the game.
[179:36.62]True.
[179:36.96]Song is fire.
[179:37.72]What is it from?
[179:39.18]I think Steven Universe.
[179:41.42]Oh my god.
[179:48.12]Oh my god, that tornadoes.
[179:50.89]Tornado's kind of nasty.
[179:51.95]It's disgusting.
[179:52.91]It really is.
[179:53.39]Oh, shit.
[179:53.73]Ooh, chew him up.
[180:00.93]Wait, did you eat him?
[180:01.97]That's sick.
[180:03.13]It's hard to get, though.
[180:04.03]It's hard to do.
[180:10.03]Oh, boy.
[180:10.85]What a combo.
[180:11.93]Tossed him right into it.
[180:13.89]Oh, shit.
[180:24.00]Oh, you slippery, slippery bastard.
[180:27.20]No.
[180:32.72]Oh, my God, he's got 152.
[180:33.56]No way.
[180:33.74]What the fuck?
[180:34.22]No way.
[180:38.33]Oh, my God.
[180:40.15]No, how?
[180:40.45]With 158, how?
[180:41.57]Will they double KO?
[180:54.21]Okay, we'll get fucked on that one oh Shit that thing is bad I'm gonna get fucked on this I think
[181:11.83]I can't believe that!
[181:16.45]Peace!
[181:19.35]Bitch!
[181:21.29]Who said that?
[181:21.83]That was Batman.

[181:27.01]Imagine.
[181:28.06]Taz's full anime.
[181:29.02]He speaks full English.
[181:34.06]Wait, Taz can speak English, right?
[181:36.59]No, doesn't he go like, what the fuck?
[181:38.99]No, he's like Scooby-Doo.
[181:41.79]He's like, I love you, right?
[181:44.34]He can speak English.
[181:45.16]He does not speak full English.
[181:47.00]Yes, he does.
[181:47.50]He doesn't speak full English.
[181:49.32]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[181:50.48]He'll do like little grunts and then like throw in a word.
[181:53.00]No, he's like, Taz, want action?
[181:55.50]Right, he says words.
[181:57.27]He has never said, Taz, want action?
[181:59.73]Yes, he does.
[182:00.11]I used to have a toy.

[182:59.06]I think we all did pretty good, except for Ludwig, honestly.
[183:02.50]I literally got more damage than no one.
[183:07.17]You got a KO to the Lud, that was crucial.
[183:08.89]Lud, do you have a controller?
[183:10.89]No, I do, but it won't connect.
[183:13.17]I cannot figure out how to get my Xbox controller to connect.
[183:15.63]Is it the USB micro standard bullshit?
[183:18.13]I have the controller.
[183:19.34]I have plugged it in.
[183:20.12]It is plugged in.
[183:21.08]It just doesn't work.
[183:24.88]You guys want to do FFA?
[183:25.42]Yeah, let's do it.
[183:27.44]Let's go for it.
[183:32.20]Okay, I gotta pee real quick.
[183:34.38]Stop saying remove the batteries.
[183:35.38]There are no batteries.
[183:35.86]Choose your character.
[183:37.36]Can we do a pee break?
[183:38.88]You guys want to do a pee break?
[183:41.70]Uh... We have 38 seconds.
[183:42.90]After this we can.
[183:43.44]Okay, cool.
[183:43.80]Yeah.
[183:44.06]Let's do it right after this.
[183:45.02]It won't get any different if you're playing or not.
[183:52.50]I'm gonna try this dog.
[183:55.45]Oh, the original content dog in here?
[183:59.00]Yep.
[183:59.48]Original content dog.
[184:01.16]That guy's nuts, actually.
[184:02.78]Is he good?
[184:03.82]Yeah, he's actually really good.
[184:15.08]Guarantee Hasan doesn't wash his hands.
[184:17.87]There's no time.
[184:19.77]No, he'll do it.
[184:20.73]He'll make it back.
[184:26.37]Ooh, two shaggies.
[184:29.01]I'm busting out the main for this one.
[184:30.81]Okay.
[184:33.49]Alright.
[184:41.32]Did they both go pee?
[184:42.06]I'm not sure.
[184:47.38]So what's your assessment so far of this game?
[184:49.74]Oh, I love the game.
[184:50.40]I played it a lot during the tech test, so I'm pretty well versed on it.
[184:54.58]I think it's great.
[184:56.12]I love the game.
[184:57.56]And we're no longer in ad hours.
[184:59.92]I'm not contractually obligated to say that.
[185:03.26]No, it's just a great game.
[185:04.46]It's just an absolutely fun game.
[185:05.80]I had an argument with my chat about this.
[185:10.39]Wait, what the fuck is that character?
[185:12.03]What?
[185:13.33]It's OC for the game.
[185:14.41]You don't know Rain Dog?
[185:15.99]You've never seen Rain Dog coming home?
[185:20.11]Grandma got run over by a Rain Dog?

[186:36.94]Wait, what?
[186:37.86]Oh my god.
[186:38.64]That was nasty.

[186:51.30]Oh, I'm so fucked, dude.

[186:53.02]Why did I chase you?
[186:53.76]Oh my lord.
[186:54.48]I can't believe it.
[186:56.38]I'm killing myself?
[186:57.10]Yo, can someone fucking kill Big Moist, please?
[186:59.64]I just died twice.
[187:00.38]I've killed myself, like, twice now.
[187:02.62]Does that mean ring out double bonus, though?
[187:04.43]I don't... You're speaking gamer words that not even I know.
[187:10.19]Gamer words.
[187:17.04]What is popping right now?
[187:18.16]Oh my god.
[187:23.59]Why do you get the kick when I pull?
[187:26.45]Why?
[187:28.39]I knew that'd get ya.
[187:31.41]Oh, you have 19 points?
[187:32.53]Wait, did you get that one too?
[187:34.27]Dude, what the fuck?
[187:35.63]What the hell?
[187:37.33]23 points?
[187:39.01]I have zero!
[187:39.93]We're not even, fuck, our trolls aren't even plugged in.
[187:47.83]What?
[187:48.69]I just killed myself.
[187:49.57]I have zero points now.
[187:50.64]Fuck me.
[187:51.02]I'm worse than Ludd.
[187:52.14]This is devastating.
[187:53.12]That was so good.
[188:01.26]That was so bad.
[188:01.98]I wonder who won that one.
[188:02.98]That was so bad.
[188:09.15]Oh, man.
[188:09.43]You got to love those kind of matches.
[188:10.85]I got to tell you.
[188:12.87]Dude, you are the king of kill stealing, Moist.
[188:15.60]I don't know.
[188:16.62]No, no, no, no.
[188:17.61]The damage says otherwise.
[188:19.35]Okay, bro.
[188:20.09]Our damage is not even remotely close, so yes, you are right.
[188:23.75]But that was fun.
[188:25.37]Yeah, I use numbers over here.
[188:28.43]Is your bug also transferring over to your points as well as your damage?
[188:34.27]You want to check that?
[188:37.94]That was nasty, by the way.
[188:39.38]We got all... We got absolutely slam dunked on.
[188:41.55]Blood.
[188:42.41]Yeah, that felt good.
[188:44.01]It felt good for me.
[188:44.65]That was a nice match.
[188:47.46]Alright, people want me to play as Jake.
[188:48.96]I'll try it.
[188:51.18]Is he donut walling me because he's the worst person on this lobby?
[188:55.44]Just by being a sweaty Smash player?
[188:57.44]1v1 me.
[188:58.62]1v1 me right now.
[189:00.45]I will after we're done, you know, after I'm done wiping the floors with you.
[189:04.49]I would watch that.
[189:05.63]I'd actually really like to watch that.
[189:06.95]Is there spectators?
[189:08.17]After I'm done whipping you like a towel?
[189:10.81]I mean, we can just do free-for-all and we can just stand away.
[189:13.81]Oh, true, true, true.
[189:15.57]Stand on the side.
[189:16.05]Do you guys want to hash that out right now?
[189:18.39]You could.
[189:18.81]Let's hash it out right now.
[189:20.33]Let's hash it out right now.
[189:21.28]Come on, big man.
[189:22.02]Batman versus Superman.
[189:23.00]Old school.
[189:23.30]Okay, that's canonical.
[189:25.34]Adventure Time Cruise is going to kind of hang out in the bleachers.
[189:27.92]You're canonically dumb.
[189:29.20]Oh, hey, Ludwig, you got to go like this.
[189:30.36]Fucking so good, dude.
[189:31.68]You're going to go like what?
[189:33.42]Prepare yourself.
[189:36.88]Are you doing Batman?
[189:39.16]Yeah.
[189:41.13]No, you got to go.
[189:43.23]Do you bleed?
[189:47.00]You know you're not doing it.
[189:49.62]You sound like Batman has a stoma.
[189:52.54]We can't do free-for-all when you guys stand on the sidelines because accidentally we're going to get points.
[189:56.96]No, no, we're on the bottom.
[189:59.42]We'll come up.
[190:00.60]We will all the way to the top.
[190:02.29]Wait, what?
[190:03.15]Oh, what the fuck?
[190:09.83]This is going to be embarrassing.
[190:12.75]I'm excited.
[190:17.35]Hasan, freeze breath.
[190:18.45]You have freeze breath.
[190:19.19]It's really good.
[190:20.45]I don't know how to do that.
[190:21.39]How do I do that?
[190:22.03]Standard triangle.
[190:24.71]Oh, lud.
[190:29.05]Stupid ass.
[190:36.46]Oh, shit.
[190:37.28]The weekend is too powerful.
[190:38.42]Sorry for all this.
[190:42.54]Ooh.
[190:45.88]Oh, good movement, Lud.
[190:48.12]That was actually really good.
[190:52.04]Bro, you're using items in a 1v1.
[190:54.72]I'm in the lead.
[190:55.64]You deadass just picked up an item and healed all your health.
[190:57.86]Wait, am I not allowed to?
[190:58.84]Wait, is that bad?
[191:00.52]I actually don't know.
[191:01.53]You've been using items.
[191:02.51]I get it, bro.
[191:03.03]I get it.
[191:03.33]Dragon-esque this.
[191:04.21]Come on.
[191:05.11]Wait, what?
[191:05.69]I'm sorry.
[191:06.21]You've been using items?
[191:07.03]I get it, bro.
[191:07.73]Hey, I get it.
[191:15.05]You've got him now, Lud.
[191:21.05]I'm the most annoying guy in the movie theater.
[191:22.75]Oh, that's you laughing?
[191:35.74]Yeah.
[191:39.24]Wait, what?
[191:39.76]Dude, come on!
[191:41.32]What?
[191:41.54]Oh.
[191:42.42]Oh, I thought you got that kill.
[191:43.99]Just being annoying.
[191:44.71]You have a smoke screen, by the way, Lud.
[191:49.98]You might want to use it.
[191:52.54]What was that, dude?
[191:53.32]That smoke screen's good.
[191:55.68]Nice.
[191:55.92]Good up air.
[191:56.32]Stop healing, you son of a bitch!
[192:10.21]going up air watch out no it's just so fucking late he's full healed like three times yeah he just keeps getting the giant med packs oh no should we should we keep going I mean it's over now
[192:32.61]What was that for $5,000?
[192:34.11]No Jigglypuff.
[192:34.91]It's fine.
[192:36.19]No Jigglypuff.
[192:37.93]Disconnected.
[192:38.47]Yeah, I'm disconnected.
[192:40.04]I'm going to get my fucking controller working and I'm going to come back.
[192:43.30]I'm not playing another second with this cheating keyboard mouse.
[192:46.58]Let's go!
[192:47.94]That was a good fight.
[192:48.54]That was a good round.
[192:50.94]Hey, good game, man.
[192:52.18]Is what I would say if you played a good game, but you played a terrible game.
[192:54.74]I'm sorry.
[192:55.36]I almost reported.
[192:56.02]You just sit there, and all you do is just accumulate the wealth of health packs.
[193:02.19]Medicare for all, baby!
[193:03.33]For one!
[193:05.37]For one!
[193:06.95]Yeah, well, I mean... You know?
[193:09.91]If you need to use it, you should be able to use it, is my argument.
[193:13.11]Alright, what are we doing?
[193:14.53]Are we continuing?
[193:15.69]Yeah, what's the plan, buddy?
[193:16.57]You getting that controller set up?
[193:17.61]What's going on?
[193:18.29]You guys do a free...
[193:20.10]Free-for-all?
[193:20.86]Such a bad winner?
[193:21.80]Okay, guys, I'm not a gamer.
[193:23.60]Like, I'm not being serious either.
[193:26.22]Ludwig could fucking wipe the floor with me in every game.
[193:29.19]Wait, hold on a second.
[193:29.79]Except for this one.
[193:30.71]Hassan, you beat Elden Ring, didn't you?
[193:33.35]I did.
[193:33.61]I was better than Lud on that, too.
[193:36.05]But you can't... You're a gamer.
[193:38.09]If you can beat Elden Ring... If you can beat Elden Ring, I think you get the gamer card, I'd say.
[193:47.83]This non-gamer beat me multiple times.
[193:53.64]Alright, I think we have to make a new party, right?
[193:56.70]Yeah.
[193:57.36]Yeah.
[193:58.36]Who has everybody on a friends list?
[194:00.26]I think it's... Is it you, Hasan?
[194:03.19]I believe so.
[194:05.77]We're all in the recently played, though, so you can just invite through there if you want to host again, Jerma.
[194:09.81]Or Hasan hosts, it doesn't matter.
[194:12.33]How do we... I guess like this?
[194:15.46]Let's see.
[194:17.47]Dude, when I alt-tab, it's so annoying.
[194:19.31]It just like is stuck.
[194:21.47]How do I... It doesn't say anybody else is online.
[194:26.46]Go to tab.
[194:27.42]Recently played with.
[194:28.40]Up on the top right corner is his social.
[194:30.26]Go to tab.
[194:30.78]Recently played with.
[194:31.48]It should come up as Comet Alpaca.
[194:33.06]Oh, there it is.
[194:33.83]Okay.
[194:34.77]Yeah.
[194:38.79]Which, Comet Alpaca, I sent you a invite.
[194:42.39]Wait, no, that's not, who's Comet Alpaca?
[194:44.47]Wait, oh shit, oh wait, I think that's, is that Lyric?
[194:47.47]That might be Lyric, yeah.
[194:49.01]I'm probably like, oops.
[194:51.91]I'm not pressing win tab, chat, I'm not.
[194:56.60]I'm probably like, is this Jerma?
[194:57.78]Like, why is, Jerma's like pinging me.
[195:08.33]you guys getting those invites no I haven't got it yet mine's uh the big moist yeah I should says party and party invite I tried inviting everybody am I just like still in your party or something I'm not seeing it and I'm also not able to uh I don't know how to do uh I don't know how to do a party
[195:33.34]Oh, okay, custom.
[195:34.50]Okay, okay, create online lobby.
[195:36.12]Oh, you have to actually make a custom game first.
[195:37.66]Yeah, I'm making it right now.
[195:38.60]I'm making it right now.
[195:39.30]Okay, hold up, hold up, hold up.
[195:42.42]Wait, oh my god, my fucking keyboard is broken.
[195:46.92]Wait, there's something wrong with my keyboard.
[195:48.34]I press escape and the Windows button works.
[195:53.33]Dude, you need to get a whole new computer.
[195:55.93]Wait, what the fuck?
[195:57.41]That is weird.
[195:58.13]Hold up.
[196:02.20]Yeah, dude, I think your graphics card, your hard drive, your memory, it's all going.
[196:05.50]I'm not even kidding.
[196:06.36]I'm like literally pressing escape.
[196:08.06]That's why it was locking whenever I alt tabbed.
[196:10.91]When I press escape, the windows, it triggers the windows key for no reason.
[196:17.27]Really?
[196:17.51]That's weird.
[196:18.97]Yeah.
[196:20.11]My control is not even on right now, but it thinks it's like, no, my control is not stuck.
[196:26.60]Maybe just restart the game.
[196:31.50]Yeah, it might just be, like, memory leak or something.
[196:34.00]I couldn't tell you.
[196:35.20]Just try reloading.
[196:39.88]Oh, okay.
[196:40.34]It's working.
[196:40.90]I just, like, I unplugged it and I slammed it a bunch of times and it's working now.
[196:45.16]I'm going to the lab.
[196:46.01]I want to check out something.
[196:52.05]Yeah, I mean, Velma, seriously.
[196:54.81]Velma's standard attack is a projectile and it's awesome.
[196:58.79]No, your Velma was nasty.
[197:00.05]Scarlet Otter is you, right?
[197:01.70]Yeah.
[197:03.30]Okay.
[197:04.77]Big moist.
[197:05.65]Added.
[197:06.21]Invited player.
[197:08.95]The only person I don't have is Ludd.
[197:12.45]And I think I added him, but... Ludd.
[197:18.33]Are you there?
[197:19.19]Is he there?
[197:20.87]He's furiously going through cabinets to try to find a way to plug a controller in, I think.
[197:27.71]Isn't he sitting it out?
[197:28.69]He said you guys...
[197:31.72]Did I beat his ass so mercilessly that he had to fucking rage quit?
[197:34.66]That's crazy.
[197:35.40]That's so sad.
[197:36.48]You actually just spanked him so hard that he's now spending like 20 minutes getting a controller to work.
[197:41.48]That's wild.
[197:42.26]That's a wild state of affairs, man.
[197:44.74]You hate to see it.
[197:51.32]We're not even in the title, Jerma.
[197:53.68]It just says big stream for top Gs only multiverses with big man penguins though.
[197:59.04]Who?
[198:00.44]My stream title?
[198:02.22]No, I'm saying Ludd's stream title.
[198:04.08]Oh, Ludd's stream title.
[198:05.80]No one's in my stream title.
[198:08.35]My stream title is dog shit.
[198:09.55]I freaked out because I moved to the sponsor segment and I was like, I don't know what to title this.
[198:12.91]So I was like, let's go.
[198:13.81]Bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs.
[198:15.15]I don't know.
[198:18.57]You don't do a lot of sponsor streams, do you?
[198:20.09]Like gaming sponsor streams?
[198:22.55]I mean, recently I have been.
[198:26.85]Kind of a new thing.
[198:31.88]It just says bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs.
[198:34.06]What is working with the tech for the control?
[198:35.86]This is why Ludd doesn't hang out with you.
[198:40.22]Okay.
[198:41.70]That's kind of fucked up.
[198:43.37]That is fucked up.
[198:44.57]And the real reason is because... Wait, hazard is enabled, by the way, or no?
[198:49.47]No, no, no.
[198:50.07]Turn those off if we're going to be doing some FFA.
[198:54.55]Actually, just let it be wacky.
[198:56.69]You can do some hazards.
[198:58.14]Let it ride.
[198:58.58]Fuck it.
[198:59.02]It'll be wacky.
[198:59.78]Free-for-all time, two and a half minutes.
[199:03.96]Yeah, it says bugs that many times because I'm a bugs main.
[199:11.84]I'm going to take this moment to use the restroom.
[199:13.52]I'll be right back, boys.
[199:14.20]Actually, you know what?
[199:15.14]That's probably a good idea.
[199:17.07]Weren't you looking for a time to go pee, Hassan?
[199:19.25]I already did.
[199:20.11]I'm so quick with it.
[199:21.97]I do gamer pees.
[199:23.59]Dude, I'm such an old man.
[199:25.87]It takes me like two minutes at least to pee.
[199:29.59]My community times my pisses, so mine is like around...
[199:34.58]a minute and twelve, I think.
[199:36.94]One twelve.
[199:38.44]I, um... It's a little bit faster than my five hundred on the... on the, uh... on the rowing machine.
[199:47.73]Rowing machine?
[199:48.33]Alright.
[199:50.25]Grimma, you work out, right?
[199:51.71]Right, go piss, go piss.
[199:52.75]I used to.
[199:53.41]Alright, I'm not gonna mute this... Chalk it up, lady.
[199:55.53]I'm not gonna mute this, uh, this call, so make sure you behave, please.
[199:59.24]Sponsor strength.
[199:59.92]Okay, I'm gonna say so many gamer words right now.
[200:03.36]Don't you dare.
[200:08.87]79 seconds last time.
[200:09.69]Good looks, champ.
[200:10.37]You got it.
[200:10.89]Oh, by the way, chat, I completely nailed it on the Tucker Carlson thing that I said he was going to say.
[200:23.74]Apparently his segment came out and it's identical to what I said he was going to say.
[200:28.10]Yeah.
[200:29.70]Yeah.
[200:37.81]Even with the Sandy Cortez lock.
[200:39.97]That's crazy.
[200:41.01]Wait, I should mute myself.
[200:44.39]I'm muting.
[202:16.82]Alright, I'm back.
[202:47.28]How's everybody doing?
[202:48.32]Everybody just chilling?
[202:56.15]We good?
[203:02.33]No, but seriously.
[203:03.11]Honestly, seriously.
[203:04.43]Let me just say the same thing three times.
[203:07.25]Warner Brothers Interactive, thanks for sponsoring the stream.
[203:11.51]The ad segment, I guess, is kind of over, but we're still playing.
[203:14.48]This is really fun.
[203:15.34]Really cool opportunity.
[203:16.40]I'm really happy to play it.
[203:18.94]The game is great.
[203:23.56]Again, I'll say it one more time.
[203:26.45]It's free to play.
[203:30.81]It's got tons of cool characters.
[203:34.03]If you're watching and you have drops enabled, it's kind of this early access period.
[203:40.14]July 26th, it goes into open beta, actually open open beta.
[203:46.97]You can get it on anything.
[203:47.73]PlayStation, Xbox, PC, full cross compatibility, cross progression.
[203:54.34]You can play wherever.
[204:02.21]People are gonna think I'm a weirdo when this comes over here.
[204:06.35]I mean, it's kind of weird what I'm doing, but whatever.
[204:08.51]I didn't have any clean cups.
[204:19.57]Wait, what does Hassan do?
[204:23.50]Hey, you here?
[204:26.04]How we doing?
[204:27.34]I'm here.
[204:28.90]I'm just doing, you know, a little bit of politics, you know.
[204:34.20]Just a little?
[204:34.92]Having some fun.
[204:35.87]I muted myself.
[204:36.63]Don't worry.
[204:37.03]I did not radicalize the Jermaniacs.
[204:40.13]Excuse me.
[204:42.67]What?
[204:42.97]They're not the Jermaniacs.
[204:44.93]Fuck, what were they?
[204:45.87]The germaphobes?
[204:46.75]The Jermamites.
[204:48.45]The Jermamites.
[204:49.27]Damn it.
[204:49.79]Okay.
[204:53.33]Yeah, do your thing.
[204:53.83]I think Ludwig is probably putting holes in his drywall, looking for a cord.
[205:12.99]Okay, that looks good.
[205:16.87]Hello.
[205:19.21]I mean, it's kind of weird what I'm doing, but whatever.
[205:22.33]Jeremy, you want to you want to one we've honored one V1?
[205:24.73]I don't know.
[205:25.65]You know, we can probably wait.
[205:27.77]You want to just invite me?
[205:31.02]Yeah.
[205:36.24]I'm drinking it out of the pitcher.
[205:37.92]Let me finish this fire tweet.
[205:40.10]You got a good tweet.
[205:41.92]Well, I just you watch Tucker Carlson.
[205:47.03]Are you familiar with his rhetoric?
[205:49.17]I'm familiar with the man, Tucker Carlson.
[205:51.25]Yeah.
[205:52.39]Well, earlier today, someone in the chat asked me what Tucker Carlson is going to say about AOC getting arrested at Capitol Hill for protesting outside of the Supreme Court of the United States.
[206:03.18]And I basically nailed, I mean, nailed his exact speech.
[206:08.94]Word for word?
[206:09.32]With like one minor exception.
[206:11.00]Not word for word, but down to like the psychotic Joker laugh that he was going to do.
[206:16.28]There was a Joker laugh involved?
[206:18.64]Yeah.
[206:19.52]He likes to do Joker laughs.
[206:27.95]Let's 1v1.
[206:30.01]Okay, let's do it.
[206:34.04]I need an invite.
[206:34.72]Hold on.
[206:38.71]Okay, let's do another lobby.
[206:40.85]Custom lobby.
[206:46.08]I got a picture of ice cold water.
[206:47.44]No, I don't want to drink on camera because it's like really bright glass and it's going to like reflect off the screen and show my dick.
[207:03.59]I just invited you.
[207:15.42]Dude, I just said something so crazy that the chat froze because people just spammed question marks.
[207:22.53]What did you say?
[207:25.21]I just said the word dick and everybody freaked out.
[207:29.03]The chat actually broke.
[207:30.37]It stopped functioning for like three or four straight seconds.
[207:32.48]It happens, dude.
[207:35.76]Why?
[207:37.82]Okay, we're doing... Should we do 2v2 against people or should we do 1v1?
[207:41.78]Oh, wait, he's back.
[207:46.48]where's charlie uh I think he's hanging out yeah I'm here I'm ready okay everything works with one weird exception Jeremy you gotta leave again I think oh so I can because I don't know how to put you back in the in my lobby oh wait I'll just remove you I can leave wait here hold on and I'm gonna add you again
[208:17.78]Oh, if me and Ludd are going to do 1v1 in free-for-all, then you guys are going to watch.
[208:20.96]It doesn't really matter what team you're in, right?
[208:23.22]Nah.
[208:23.84]Did you get a controller?
[208:25.92]Yeah, we're not going to do 2v2.
[208:26.82]I got a controller.
[208:27.73]Oh, hell yeah.
[208:28.75]Only weird thing is it has an insane amount of lag, but I'm sure that's fine.
[208:33.51]What kind of controller is it?
[208:35.25]Xbox.
[208:37.83]Xbox One Xbox 360 uh lud you have to you have to accept my friend request on your on your warner brothers like account or whatever and moist I added you as well I'll be there just one sec oh here I just added I just sent you an invite
[209:24.73]Put down the pitcher.
[209:25.49]I almost saw it.
[209:26.81]Whatever.
[209:27.49]Can you imagine like a reflection off the screen, off this, and like just me naked?
[209:34.67]Are you?
[209:35.91]No.
[209:37.37]Hasan, you friended me, smiley face?
[209:39.89]I did.
[209:41.35]The only time where we actually, you know... You should be in your friend invites, but you probably have a lot right now.
[209:50.70]But I also sent you an invite to the game.
[209:53.90]How do I scroll through this, though?
[209:56.10]This is the only time where we're friends.
[210:02.56]I like the Mystery Machine profile picture, Ludwig.
[210:06.72]Yeah, it's because I love Scooby, but also do.
[210:09.73]Mm-hmm.
[210:14.85]What's new Scooby-Doo coming after you?
[210:17.85]Gonna find that mystery.
[210:22.18]What's new Scooby-Doo?
[210:26.05]Isn't it Scooby-Dooby-Doo, Where Are You?
[210:29.83]I'm referring to the newer one.
[210:31.59]You got some... I never was a big Scooby-Doo fan.
[210:36.33]Are we waiting on Big Man?
[210:37.59]Yeah.
[210:39.69]I always thought that Scooby-Doo would be a great serial character.
[210:43.31]Why am I fucking...
[210:45.98]Things showing.
[210:46.76]I already, I thought I shut it off.
[210:49.59]Scooby Snacks would just be a great cereal.
[210:51.81]They should have just made Scooby Snacks and he would just do commercials.
[210:53.79]He would be the coolest one out of all of them.
[210:55.11]He would kick the shit out of Tony the Tiger.
[210:56.87]Scooby Snack cereal?
[211:02.45]People are saying they already did that.
[211:04.03]There are multiple Scooby universes?
[211:06.55]Yeah, but it was a limited time probably thing.
[211:07.97]It's not like Tony the Tiger presents Frosted Flakes.
[211:14.90]yeah I don't know why I'm getting party invites non-stop I I thought I ended the if you go into your settings the left side I did oh you did I I did that already yeah party invites from friends only oh okay you should do that show friend invite notifications I turned off I guess party invites from friends only I'm ready alright I invited you again
[211:42.78]They have Scooby Snack cookies?
[211:45.20]That's probably... Why do I feel like you're making this up and I'm gonna go buy dog biscuits?
[211:54.71]Doesn't sound right.
[211:55.91]Well, I mean, if they're dog biscuits, doesn't that make it real?
[211:58.26]Actually, Scooby-Doo eats a lot of human food, which is bad.
[212:01.02]It's not good.
[212:02.91]Yeah, it's like a bunch of subs and shit with like garlic and onions on it.
[212:05.97]Like your dog will start begging I heard you weren't a cat person until recently and now you have toxoplasmosis That's fucked up.
[212:14.41]Is that true?
[212:15.05]What?
[212:16.27]Oh, no, I don't have I don't have toxoplasmosis, but I have become more of a cat person Interesting Okay, where's the toxoplasmosis thing coming from?
[212:29.15]Um, toxoplasmosis is when you, like, it's just like cat poop makes you love your cat and become, like, servile to your cat.
[212:38.00]Yeah, like brainwashed.
[212:39.22]I thought, isn't that the thing that makes you take, like, more risks?
[212:45.17]I don't know about that.
[212:46.67]I don't have it.
[212:47.27]It's something that someone with toxoplasmosis would say, though, for sure.
[212:55.11]Anyway, I don't know.
[212:58.83]We'll see if the new game Stray that came out, if that'll make me love cats.
[213:03.58]Everybody's playing that.
[213:04.44]Is it cool?
[213:05.70]It looks pretty cool.
[213:08.04]A cat simulator game.
[213:08.98]It looks cool.
[213:09.56]Are you not a cat person, Hassan?
[213:11.67]I mean, I'm not like a huge cat person.
[213:14.11]I like kittens, but I do think that cats are too hot and cold for me.
[213:17.86]You know what I mean?
[213:20.40]I like the lifelong companionship of a dog more than... So are we doing just free brawl?
[213:30.18]I don't know.
[213:30.64]Is it 1v1?
[213:30.82]Is it 1v1?
[213:31.10]Okay, well...
[213:52.07]Get me away from that edge!
[213:53.27]Shit.
[213:56.44]Oh god!
[213:58.76]How did you even die, Lud?
[214:00.02]There was no... Nobody attacked you.
[214:03.12]My controller's on Bluetooth and it has three second latency.
[214:05.99]You're on Bluetooth?
[214:08.81]Jerm, it's been a rough day for me.
[214:10.35]Oh my goodness.
[214:11.53]Yeah, dude, imagine getting owned by me.
[214:12.87]That's fucking really rough, dude.
[214:14.31]Alright.
[214:14.97]Come on, man.
[214:16.71]You survived!
[214:17.80]I don't know how.
[214:22.41]You're blocking in this game just dodging so perfect dodge Can I get the follow-up can I get the follow-up Shit I need that I need that bad.
[214:51.13]I need that so bad
[214:56.70]Oh, I'm dead.
[214:58.72]I'm so dead.
[215:01.89]I couldn't get back.
[215:02.73]Well done, well done.
[215:04.11]Wait, was that me?
[215:05.59]I'm having a rough game right now, boys.
[215:28.76]What do you mean?
[215:29.22]Aren't you?
[215:29.64]Oh, no, it's actually... Oh, shit.
[215:31.34]Jerma's killing it.
[215:32.35]Yeah, Jerma's going nuts.
[215:34.31]I drank a pitcher of water.
[215:35.41]I'm back.
[215:35.85]Wait, that double ring out was you?
[215:39.27]I thought that was me.
[215:51.85]I hate this.
[215:54.01]Did someone say Scooby Snack?
[215:57.64]Oh, did I take it at the end?
[215:58.80]Oh, no.
[215:59.60]That was close.
[216:00.22]Yeah, it was close.
[216:02.80]Um, where's my, where's my, oh.
[216:08.13]GG, GG.
[216:08.65]Congratulations.
[216:09.25]Good work.
[216:10.53]It's the first free-for-all I think I've won today.
[216:12.15]Um, you know, congratulations on kill-stealing the entire game.
[216:15.30]It's fine.
[216:15.84]I mean, not a big deal.
[216:16.90]Top damage.
[216:18.26]Uh, Ludwig.
[216:18.72]Whatever.
[216:20.86]Ludwig, uh, you good?
[216:25.56]Are you there?
[216:29.93]I think steam is coming out of his ears.
[216:32.77]Are you there, dude?
[216:33.54]Are you okay?
[216:38.96]Stop talking to me, man.
[216:40.80]So you guys want to do your 1v1, or do you want to keep doing free-for-all?
[216:44.52]What do you guys want to do?
[216:45.28]Are you okay with doing a 1v1, or what's happening?
[216:50.25]He's looking at his controller furiously.
[216:52.75]I just found a new one.
[216:56.03]Okay.
[216:57.95]Let's do another free-for-all.
[217:02.91]Do you get banned from all the Smash tournaments going forward if you get owned so mercilessly by someone as bad as me?
[217:12.27]How does that work?
[217:16.73]Damn, Ludd is just hitting you with a cold shoulder real hard right now.
[217:19.61]I think he's going to punch you.
[217:21.14]Yeah, it sounds like it's about to be a schoolyard fight here.
[217:23.84]Oh, no.
[217:30.63]Oh, that was definitely a bunch of batteries that just fell.
[217:33.54]Is this bullying in Bannable?
[217:35.28]I'm just taking out all my frustrations because I asked Ludd to come with me to the UK and potentially Amsterdam.
[217:41.42]And he was just like, yeah, just ask QT.
[217:44.49]Wait, he left the lobby again?
[217:45.99]Dude, it sounded like he was rolling dice for damage to you.
[217:54.21]Oh no.
[217:58.74]Demand an Everything, Everywhere, All at Once Moist Meter from Charlie. Why?
[218:03.00]Oh I still haven't watched that movie. I need to.
[218:05.00]Dude, it's so good.
[218:07.00]Not to- not to impact the integrity of the Moist Meter, but it was brilliant. It was great.
[218:10.00]I've heard nothing but good things about that movie. It looks good, I just never saw it in theater and I still haven't watched it on streaming.
[218:16.00]Yeah.
[218:17.00]What about uh The Black Phone? I heard that's really good too.
[218:20.00]I missed that one as well, that one also came out when I couldn't go to a theater.
[218:24.55]Wait, you thought that was good?
[218:25.48]I heard that... I heard... I don't think Will liked it.
[218:28.20]And Will is like my go-to for horror movies.
[218:30.60]I haven't seen it.
[218:33.72]It's got pretty good reviews.
[218:34.82]Audience score is pretty good too.
[218:35.78]I don't know.
[218:37.68]It's pretty positively received, especially for a horror movie.
[218:40.65]Wait, Charlie, did you watch RRR?
[218:43.21]No, I love Bollywood though, so I'm definitely going to watch it.
[218:45.45]Movie of the Summer.
[218:45.95]Movie of the Summer.
[218:46.85]Oh, if you already like Bollywood, you're going to fucking flip.
[218:51.18]I'm excited.
[218:51.72]I've seen the clips on Twitter.
[218:52.86]They're so hyper like the Tigers.
[218:54.14]It is so dumb.
[218:55.93]It's so good.
[218:56.87]It's so fucking good.
[218:58.21]It was bad.
[218:59.57]Really?
[219:00.67]Yeah, it looks really good, Jerma.
[219:02.43]Do you watch Bollywood at all, Jerma?
[219:03.63]I feel like you'd be a big Bollywood fan.
[219:05.31]Oh, no, sorry.
[219:06.05]People are saying the black phone was bad.
[219:08.37]I feel like I would love Bollywood films.
[219:11.62]Yeah, they're right up your alley, I feel.
[219:13.88]Something like Gentleman or something is so good.
[219:16.54]It's iconic.
[219:19.13]Give me a list of your top five.
[219:20.45]I'll watch them.
[219:22.14]New Gentleman.
[219:23.30]We're top three.
[219:27.74]I think Gentleman and then there's... What's the one with... This one's for chat.
[219:31.14]The one where the bad guy has a bunch of clones and they all form a giant cube.
[219:35.86]A giant sphere.
[219:36.60]What?
[219:37.74]It's so cool.
[219:38.38]I can never remember the name of it.
[219:39.59]Is it Singham?
[219:40.17]Oh, I know what you're talking about.
[219:41.91]They all get... All the cops get together and they become like a giant human cube and they start like rolling through town like Katamari Damacy.
[219:48.47]It's amazing.
[219:49.09]That movie is that whole movie is good.
[219:50.55]That's just one scene.
[219:51.31]I can't remember the name of it though.
[219:52.37]Oh my god.
[219:53.13]Alright.
[219:53.85]I'm interested.
[219:55.09]People are saying Bahu Bali in here on Indian Terminator.
[219:58.50]Is that what it is?
[220:00.12]Might be a lot of people are saying robot and I think that's the one I think it's robot.
[220:04.60]Hey, can I get a quick invite guys?
[220:08.24]Your ELO levels too low, I think, unfortunately.
[220:13.40]You're ELO level, isn't that?
[220:14.90]That's not what you're supposed to say, right?
[220:16.42]You're supposed to say ELO.
[220:17.28]That's how little of a fucking gamer I am.
[220:18.76]I need a reason right now, Hasan.
[220:20.76]Here, I... Just fucking accept my friend request so I can easily add you.
[220:25.94]It's getting heated.
[220:27.00]It's getting heated.
[220:27.80]Oh, shit.
[220:28.22]Did I do 2v2?
[220:28.78]Give me a free.
[220:30.84]Free for all?
[220:31.48]Is this 1v1?
[220:31.78]Or are we doing just... No, no, no.
[220:33.06]I don't know what I did.
[220:34.27]Good old-fashioned free.
[220:36.15]You got it.
[220:38.47]Here, I'll go Superman this time.
[220:43.03]Do you still have latency, or are you good now?
[220:46.79]I'm on my third controller.
[220:48.75]It's worked this time.
[220:50.15]Why are they censored?
[220:51.55]Oh.
[220:53.53]Is it maybe your cable, Lud?
[220:54.84]Are you using the same cable for every controller?
[220:58.18]No, it might be.
[221:00.40]So it didn't work with cable.
[221:01.84]It only worked with Bluetooth.
[221:03.56]Oh, gotcha.
[221:04.50]And I tried two controllers, and neither worked.
[221:06.84]So I just called it quits after a while.
[221:09.00]But then I found a Nintendo Switch Pro controller.
[221:12.39]Oh, I love the pro controller.
[221:14.57]I think it's a pro one.
[221:19.27]End Hiran.
[221:20.29]End Hiran.
[221:22.55]That's the one with them forming the giant human.
[221:26.53]That's the one?
[221:27.89]Yeah, that one is amazing.
[221:29.09]And then another great one is Singham.
[221:32.72]Blood.
[221:33.90]I have a recommendation for the controller thing.
[221:36.14]Like, I have a fix.
[221:39.96]Blood.
[221:42.96]He's dialed in, Hasan.
[221:44.76]Is he not talking to me?
[221:45.56]Like, what's going on?
[221:46.24]Is he actually mad at me?
[221:47.52]I don't understand.
[221:49.30]It's called getting good and not dying like that.
[221:51.58]You just did the way you died just now.
[222:01.33]I have not landed a hit right now.
[222:02.55]I am getting absolutely worked.
[222:06.05]Oh, that was a good pickup.
[222:12.88]You know, I really appreciate being able to grab the wall, because I would have died a thousand more times than I already have.
[222:18.32]Yeah, that's huge.
[222:18.86]It's crucial.
[222:19.62]Oh, shit!
[222:22.42]Watch my eye on you.
[222:32.48]Watch your head.
[222:34.70]Oh!
[222:38.94]Grab him.
[222:39.74]How many good that's on you?
[222:52.68]I got you with that last hit there.
[222:55.06]That was a good wallop.
[223:12.11]Ludwig.
[223:17.07]Ludwig.
[223:17.47]Incredible.
[223:18.03]Brilliant technique, brother.
[223:19.23]What?
[223:19.75]What happened?
[223:24.71]Fuck you, dude.
[223:25.49]I needed that.
[223:29.12]The blow the kiss thing is hard to land.
[223:32.74]Yeah.
[223:33.84]It's good though when you do.
[223:34.96]Wait, who got the ring out?
[223:50.00]Okay, God.
[223:53.75]What the fuck?
[223:54.79]Jerma is cracked, bro.
[223:57.13]Yeah, Jerma's going nuts.
[223:58.20]Dude, sometimes, sometimes when I'm, when I lock in, I pretend to be a gamer for an hour or so.
[224:08.66]Oh, no!
[224:10.64]Oh, the screen is closing in.
[224:12.38]Holy shit.
[224:13.92]What the fuck?
[224:15.31]Dude, this is insane.
[224:16.29]The screen, I didn't know that.
[224:18.61]I just lost, I had it and I lost it big time.
[224:21.19]I got like kicked out.
[224:24.18]That's a pretty funny feature.
[224:25.42]You actually... Wait, where should I put the camera?
[224:27.68]Where are you guys putting the camera?
[224:30.00]I did bottom left.
[224:31.70]Holy shit, Lud.
[224:37.12]Oh, my.
[224:38.00]Okay, one second, one second.
[224:39.40]Hey, man.
[224:40.78]It's... It's alright.
[224:42.04]It's okay.
[224:42.94]It's okay.
[224:43.58]It's alright.
[224:44.62]It's... It is.
[224:46.58]Yeah, no, you're doing great.
[224:48.28]And then... And then I want this to just be that, right?
[224:52.81]And then...
[225:00.98]More Feef?
[225:01.80]More Freef?
[225:04.05]More Free-for-All?
[225:05.07]Yeah, you can run some more Feef while we wait for him.
[225:11.75]Dude, how much water is in a pitcher of water?
[225:15.81]That's like 60 ounces.
[225:18.41]Or whatever this is.
[225:20.09]Excuse me?
[225:20.61]What?
[225:20.93]Never mind.
[225:22.19]Everyone forget I said anything.
[225:24.41]How much water is in this, do you think?
[225:27.05]Like, how much water do you think is in this?
[225:29.61]Like 60 ounces?
[225:31.49]Yeah!
[225:32.29]Yeah!
[225:33.33]Wait, Ludwig left again.
[225:34.45]Come on, send me another invite as well.
[225:38.69]I'm gonna restart my game real quick.
[225:41.67]Alright, I'll remove you.
[225:42.69]Ludwig keeps leaving.
[225:43.87]Why are you drinking out of a pitcher?
[225:47.26]Because I... I don't, um... I don't have any clean cups.
[226:02.19]Our eating is gray matter again.
[226:08.83]Do your dishes?
[226:09.97]Dude!
[226:18.16]They were all in the dishwasher.
[226:24.31]Holly and I have been sick, so we just... We ran a dishwasher and it just...
[226:32.68]This is not a vase for a flower, dude.
[226:34.70]It's a pitcher.
[226:46.22]You're too sick to press a button.
[226:47.64]I just told you, everything's in the dishwasher right now.
[226:54.13]No, I didn't shit in the dishwasher.
[226:55.47]It's time people left for saying that.
[227:01.60]Why would I do... I'm gonna, like, do a shit in the dishwasher prank thing to my own dishwasher?
[227:06.48]What are you talking about?
[227:07.41]Dude, what are you saying right now, Jerma?
[227:09.59]What is happening on your stream?
[227:10.69]I'm fighting.
[227:11.01]My chat has lost their mind.
[227:14.11]They keep talking about how I... Have you heard me?
[227:16.19]I didn't just repeat it.
[227:18.03]Yeah.
[227:19.53]Shit in a dishwasher prank?
[227:21.39]They're saying that, like, I did that, and it's making me very upset.
[227:29.36]It was one guy...
[227:39.26]Blood sent on stream, losing to you, put him in a mental crisis?
[227:42.03]Oh, no.
[227:45.53]We got to get Ludwig a wired controller that has .0 milliseconds.
[227:49.83]Someone in my TTS just asked, Chad, who is Jerma?
[227:52.78]Is he a criminal?
[227:53.64]What do you think, Jerma?
[227:54.40]What's your answer to that?
[227:55.60]I'm just a guy in his late 30s.
[227:57.80]That's exactly what a criminal would say.
[228:00.99]Hey, Hasan, I got a question for you.
[228:02.77]What's up?
[228:03.41]So when you're done, when you're not streaming, right?
[228:05.43]Mm-hmm.
[228:07.43]What do you do for the other, how much free time do you have after a stream?
[228:13.47]So I just, I stream usually like around eight hours minimum every day, right?
[228:19.44]Right.
[228:20.80]And I will uh... before I start streaming: I wake up early, I read the news and I throw on you know like the NP$ uh- the- the NPR linksm like the radio updates, you know what I mean?
[228:34.00]Okay.
[228:35.00]It's just like straightforward it's like read it- it's like an AP readout basically.
[228:38.00]But after stream?
[228:41.67]What?
[228:42.13]Like, after your stream.
[228:43.13]Like, when you're done.
[228:43.81]No, no, no.
[228:44.02]Before my stream.
[228:44.86]I'm giving you everything.
[228:45.80]Like, in the morning, I wake up.
[228:46.68]This is his whole day.
[228:48.10]I get the whole day.
[228:48.84]Yeah, you're getting the full day.
[228:50.76]You asked for it, even though you didn't ask for the full day.
[228:53.38]Okay.
[228:53.62]That's what I do.
[228:54.72]And then I go work out.
[228:55.94]I train with a trainer.
[228:57.90]And then afterwards, I do more reading and, like, get, you know, finish whatever the fuck I needed to do, like, to be an adult.
[229:06.31]And I start my stream at 11.
[229:07.95]11 to usually 7-8. Whatever.
[229:12.00]I'm streaming and then afterwards once I'm done probably watch like anime, movies, eat dinner.
[229:18.00]Okay so that's about- that's about an hour or two.
[229:23.00]Yeah and then I go to sleep so you- you- you- you end the stream, you watch like two or three episodes of anime, eat and go- and then go to sleep?
[229:33.00]Not two or three, I watch a lot of like movies and shit too.
[229:38.38]So you're watching probably, let's say, four or five movies a day?
[229:41.68]Oh, no, no, no.
[229:44.35]So what are you doing with that other time then?
[229:46.44]I don't know I just like I literally just chill I- I like I said I- I eat dinner, I watch some movies, I watch some anime and then I go to sleep.
[229:54.44]Goddamnit it sounds so fucking bad one when I-
[229:57.00]It's kinda sad, right, yeah. That was actually kind of sad, like I was just on the sidelines listening and feeling bad.
[229:57.00]It's kinda sad, right, yeah. That was actually kind of sad, like I was just on the sidelines listening and feeling bad.
[230:03.33]I do a lot of cool stuff.
[230:04.33]Yeah but- but you can't even explain it, right?
[230:06.00]I have sex with women.
[230:07.00]Yeah but you can't explain it- you can't explain like what you do just normally just kind of hanging out, right?
[230:13.33]No, literally, that's all I do.
[230:14.57]Like, I just, I watch anime, I watch movies, and that's it.
[230:19.41]And I eat food.
[230:20.52]Sometimes I'll link up with some friends.
[230:21.98]Like, I'll go out to, like, a restaurant or something.
[230:24.62]People thought I was crazy because they were like, oh, what do you do for the other time you're off stream?
[230:27.84]Like, you mentioned, like, oh, he's a killer, right?
[230:31.52]Oh, that's something a killer would say.
[230:33.15]I said the same exact shit.
[230:35.85]I stopped the stream.
[230:37.09]You're being a little too defensive there, okay?
[230:40.45]Sounds like what a killer would say.
[230:42.39]But you can't explain what you do in a day.
[230:44.46]You're just kind of like, okay, I do this, and then I hang out for a little bit.
[230:48.20]Jerma, why does it sound like you're looking for an alibi right now?
[230:53.00]I don't need an alibi.
[230:53.70]I'm playing multiverses with some buds.
[230:56.65]No, not right now, I'm saying.
[230:58.95]You mean like later?
[230:59.49]Okay.
[231:02.31]What would you say if like let's say like you know cops knock on your door. I mean I'm just- in a hypothetical situation and they're like:
[231:08.00]Hey, where were you during uh you know 8 p.m and and 10 p.m when this person was murdered, like where were you?
[231:17.00]Like what would you say hypothetically to that? That's what it sounds like.
[231:20.00]Probably in the bathroom, if I'm honest. Probably- actually probably in the bathroom, I was in the bathroom.
[231:30.73]Jerma legit kills people.
[231:31.98]There were 984 previous Jermas.
[231:34.26]He ended them all.
[231:35.14]Is this true?
[231:35.64]No.
[231:36.92]Don't believe everything you read on the internet.
[231:42.85]Especially in a chat room on twitch.tv.
[231:47.69]Wait, you mean to tell me that people lie on the internet?
[231:49.55]What the fuck?
[231:50.65]I lied to Charlie earlier.
[231:52.75]What did you say?
[231:53.29]What did you lie about?
[231:54.56]Remember you caught me when I said that I was playing as Jake?
[231:57.62]Oh, that's true.
[231:58.94]That's true.
[231:59.56]Yeah, that was a bold-faced lie for no reason.
[232:02.28]That was just bad manners.
[232:04.42]Deceit.
[232:05.06]Deceit is in his blood, Charlie.
[232:07.15]Is Ludwig in an engineering room crafting a controller right now?
[232:11.21]Is he, like, soldering chips?
[232:14.31]Where is he?
[232:15.41]Bro, this is what happens when you can't do React content because you're streaming on YouTube, L. He sent Qt to GameStop to pick up an old Xbox controller.
[232:26.27]How does he not have a single fucking wired controller?
[232:29.01]Hold on, he's playing another game?
[232:31.31]What?
[232:31.83]No, he's not.
[232:32.61]What?
[232:32.73]No, he's not.
[232:33.53]No, he's not, dude.
[232:35.09]No shot.
[232:37.05]Hello, hello.
[232:38.50]Are you playing a different game?
[232:39.56]Are you fucking joking?
[232:41.06]Were you training?
[232:43.02]No, I was... I haven't... Okay, I... You guys are misrepresenting me.
[232:47.98]I haven't had... Hey, no way are you fucking training right now.
[232:52.25]I was trying to figure out the controllers.
[232:55.19]Bro, you are literally the sweatiest motherfucker I've ever seen in my life, dude.
[232:59.61]Are you okay?
[232:59.89]I haven't played one game with controller.
[233:00.77]I haven't played one game with controller today.
[233:02.57]I don't even know what buttons I'm supposed to press.
[233:04.99]Dude, I don't know how to play video games at all.
[233:08.82]Hasan, you've beaten Elden Ring.
[233:11.00]Stop misrepresenting yourself.
[233:13.22]Dude, what the fuck is wrong with you, bro?
[233:16.02]Stop playing more games and get in the fucking lobby.
[233:19.23]We've been waiting for you.
[233:21.21]I'm ready.
[233:21.55]I'm ready.
[233:22.01]True.
[233:22.97]Hold on.
[233:23.39]Let me finish beating this kid.
[233:26.45]And then I'll be there.
[233:27.33]I want to see it.
[233:28.31]The music in the background makes this conversation way funnier, by the way.
[233:33.85]Oh my god!
[233:34.97]Is this like, are you giving me a gift today or something?
[233:37.31]Like, because you feel bad that you, uh, betray me all the time?
[233:40.91]Like when you gave the shirt, our friendship shirt, to Crazy Slick?
[233:43.93]I'm not... What?
[233:49.71]So you're just like, delivering L's to me?
[233:52.27]To make me look like a better gamer or something?
[233:54.19]Is that why?
[233:55.05]I just, I think you are doing really good today, sweetheart.
[233:59.24]I'm just gonna start inviting Lyric to this, uh, to this party.
[234:03.43]Yeah, I bet Lyric wouldn't be fucking... I bet Lyric wouldn't be, like, digging around, playing in, like, other lobbies, waiting for us to cool down, you know what I mean?
[234:11.98]What do you mean, cool down?
[234:13.20]Like, there's a meter?
[234:13.96]You have a certain meter of ability.
[234:15.62]Yeah, there's a moist meter, bitch.
[234:17.28]Okay, hold on.
[234:19.20]You still have not accepted my friend request, which is fine.
[234:22.18]I'll just keep doing custom game invites.
[234:27.41]I'm kicking my legs under my chair right now.
[234:29.57]I think Shaggy's good.
[234:32.07]Shaggy is really good.
[234:33.53]Shaggy is nuts.
[234:35.03]Yeah.
[234:35.57]If you know how to play.
[234:36.13]I'll use Shaggy if you're a real one.
[234:37.69]Alright, I'm ready.
[234:40.59]I'm ready.
[234:42.11]Okay.
[234:46.49]The music's so spiritual.
[234:49.27]It's really good.
[234:51.23]It's like John Williams in the booth.
[234:53.05]Alright, who is your most sought after potential... We're talking the whole Warner Brothers universe.
[234:59.98]Who would you like to see in the game?
[235:03.98]Remember, Warner Brothers owns a lot of property.
[235:07.32]Yeah, I think... I literally have to go Google.
[235:09.68]I think they have Cartoon Network, so Courage the Cowardly Dog for me.
[235:13.42]That would be awesome.
[235:14.44]That'd be so hype.
[235:15.26]You own all of Cartoon Network?
[235:17.32]I think so.
[235:18.52]Do they own Hanna-Barbera too?
[235:19.76]Like all of it?
[235:21.01]I'm pretty sure.
[235:22.38]Do they own Toonami?
[235:23.28]They do.
[235:24.30]I want Cowboy Bebop.
[235:25.74]I want Spike Siegel.
[235:28.12]Oh, LeBron James would be kind of nuts.
[235:30.35]Yo.
[235:30.63]I just want Daffy Duck.
[235:32.91]Send me another invite.
[235:33.61]I feel like LeBron could be in this.
[235:37.81]Did you say give me an invite?
[235:39.37]Yeah, send me another invite.
[235:40.45]Daffy Duck and Fred Flintstone.
[235:42.23]There you go.
[235:44.27]They own TBS.
[235:45.29]Okay, I'm in.
[235:49.78]They own TBS.
[235:53.41]The Roadrunner?
[235:55.17]Oh, that would be awesome.
[235:59.16]The Roadrunner would seriously be awesome.
[236:06.98]Dude, I missed desktop streaming so much when I was doing the IRLs and stuff and doing desktop streams from the hotel.
[236:13.90]It does not hit the same when you're just sitting in your house and doing it.
[236:22.58]Okay, this was feedback.
[236:24.37]I was looking for feedback from a lobby full of streamers.
[236:27.67]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[236:28.75]I want to be like, oh, I don't know.
[236:30.39]Like, it's crazy.
[236:31.79]Like, I don't feel that way at all.
[236:34.13]That is just kind of nuts.
[236:35.25]Dude, I was in my own world.
[236:37.72]I was literally in my own world.
[236:38.70]I'm sorry.
[236:39.96]No, it's cool, guys.
[236:40.72]I'll just fuck myself.
[236:43.64]I was just reading everyone in chat's most wanted characters, and I was going, that looks good, that looks good, that looks good.
[236:48.90]I just thought of a genius one, and it's because TBS is owned by the Warner Brothers, and they streamed E-League Counter-Strike, so I want Tarek from C-League Counter-Strike.
[237:02.25]Just with a sniper rifle.
[237:05.69]Thank you, Rooney Baby.
[237:06.41]Dude, the mask?
[237:09.13]No way.
[237:12.23]I did not pick Shaggy, so you shouldn't either.
[237:15.09]Is the mask Warner Brothers?
[237:16.65]Snap picked him.
[237:19.69]I also have a... Oh, God.
[237:21.95]I don't like perks.
[237:23.90]But I guess you get them pretty early, so it's fine.
[237:25.84]Perks are pretty helpful, yeah.
[237:26.92]Just auto-equip them.
[237:28.10]You don't need them.
[237:29.12]Dude, the mask would be insane.
[237:30.40]I don't have any promo characters.
[237:32.78]At level 10 for Shaggy, you get a great one.
[237:33.76]I wonder if there's a leak that LeBron is going to be a DLC.
[237:35.68]That'd be great.
[237:38.68]I can see that.
[237:40.88]That makes sense.
[237:42.68]I wouldn't play any other character if the mask was in the game.
[237:44.97]I would have like a thousand hours on him.
[237:49.79]Steve Urkel?
[237:50.85]Steve Urkel is not... Is Steve Urkel Warner Brothers?
[237:54.76]Maybe.
[237:55.26]They have their hand in a lot of pies.
[237:57.72]What?
[237:59.52]Oh, Jesus.
[238:00.20]I think it's a 1v1.
[238:01.56]Oh, is it a 1v1?
[238:02.78]Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
[238:05.64]What the fuck?
[238:06.44]Jesus, leave me alone.
[238:07.50]Is it a 1v1 or not?
[238:08.80]Is this a 1v1?
[238:09.38]Are we confirmed?
[238:10.34]Wait, what do you mean?
[238:11.26]It closes in.
[238:12.13]Oh, are we doing a 1v1?
[238:13.17]No, no, this stage sucks for that.
[238:15.01]Alright, alright.
[238:15.89]You know how it closes in and stuff?
[238:18.29]That's every stage, though, when you do a free roll.
[238:20.03]No, but this one specifically goes to the edges in Middle Island.
[238:25.27]Oh, shit!
[238:26.05]No!
[238:26.55]George Costanza?
[238:27.89]I don't think that's one of them.
[238:29.27]Don't do that!
[238:29.87]Don't do that!
[238:30.43]Oh, come on, boys!
[238:31.43]Why are you edgeguarding?
[238:33.71]Oh, that was the right turn.
[238:35.24]Well, you're kind of a gamer.
[238:36.78]Dude, dude, I know.
[238:37.90]You said I'm a gamer twice today, and it's made me feel so good.
[238:41.20]You're using the right terminology.
[238:46.86]Oh, what the fuck is that?
[238:48.05]It's called Velma.
[239:02.29]Get ready to eat my sword!
[239:14.04]Oh no!
[239:15.76]Okay, now I'm playing like shit.
[239:17.12]This is not good.
[239:23.72]Oh my goodness, all those bounces were exactly what I needed.
[239:28.12]Oh my gosh, what a dumpster.
[239:47.21]There I go.
[239:50.82]What the fuck?
[239:51.62]How are you doing that?
[239:53.98]I'm coming for you.
[239:57.70]Oh, my God.
[239:59.82]Oh, my God.
[240:01.24]I'm getting fucking destroyed right now.
[240:03.22]Everyone is.
[240:03.62]Why is everybody farming me?
[240:05.80]Everybody, calm down.
[240:06.46]Don't hit me anymore, please.
[240:08.76]Oh, no jobs.
[240:24.80]I got annihilated.
[240:26.58]I don't know.
[240:27.07]I actually don't know what happened.
[240:28.83]Is there a stock game mode?
[240:31.47]Yeah.
[240:31.67]That'd be swag.
[240:45.73]Hey, man.
[240:46.53]I'm really glad you fixed your controller, by the way.
[240:48.47]That was really good.
[240:49.35]That was a good performance.
[240:50.03]I mean, 12 points.
[240:50.85]So... Here you go.
[240:51.93]I'm gonna... I'm gonna... You know what?
[240:53.45]I'm gonna... I'm gonna toast you.
[240:55.31]That just means you are better at kill stealing.
[241:00.29]Which is fine.
[241:02.11]You sure you want to leave the lobby?
[241:03.92]No, I am not sure.
[241:07.12]Tony Soprano is Warner Brothers?
[241:09.74]Yo!
[241:13.94]I don't know how accurate all these are, by the way.
[241:15.62]I'm just saying what people are saying in chat.
[241:20.02]Warner Bros.
[241:22.12]characters.
[241:25.52]Let's change it up.
[241:26.43]Try something different.
[241:27.77]Yeah, I'm going to do a different character here as well.
[241:29.73]Yeah, definitely don't do Shaggy.
[241:31.03]Wait, Harry Potter's Warner Bros.? ?
[241:34.60]Imagine.
[241:36.58]Do you guys want to change the game?
[241:38.52]Oh, fuck.
[241:40.22]I started already, but... Wait, hold on.
[241:42.54]Back to the lobby?
[241:43.30]What do you mean by this?
[241:44.37]Yeah, you can put stocks on.
[241:46.77]Here, I put Moist.
[241:48.27]You're the party leader.
[241:49.63]Go ahead.
[241:50.01]Do your thing.
[241:51.71]Alright.
[241:54.83]I don't know where to do that.
[241:56.93]Oh, you get little missions.
[241:57.84]This is cool.
[242:00.60]Can you put stocks on?
[242:03.10]Highest score wins...
[242:07.15]How's Aria?
[242:08.35]Is Aria good?
[242:09.83]Yeah.
[242:12.11]Well, she was in the tech test.
[242:16.20]Teen Titans.
[242:16.96]Yeah, be tight.
[242:19.06]John Oliver is technically HBO and WB, so.
[242:23.56]I don't want to do that.
[242:24.68]I don't want to say that.
[242:25.80]And I don't want to have a turtle wearing a hat.
[242:29.38]That's pretty good.
[242:30.37]Thank you.
[242:30.63]Way better than your Batman.
[242:31.95]Thank you.
[242:36.77]I don't know if this worked, but we're gonna try it.
[242:38.51]It's fine.
[242:44.58]Okay, let's ride.
[242:46.47]Wonderbro's gonna hit me up and be like, hey, why was 30 minutes of your two-hour stream technical support?
[242:54.15]Choose your character!
[242:56.23]Are we doing, uh, are we doing, uh... No, they're gonna be like, hey, uh, we're no longer gonna partner with you because you got fucking your shit pushed in by a political streamer.
[243:04.88]1v1 right now.
[243:05.44]1v1 right now.
[243:06.34]Stock's on.
[243:06.98]Real gamers.
[243:09.07]What is stocks?
[243:11.03]Instead of like getting random amounts of points based off kills, you have a certain amount of lives.
[243:17.20]Yeah.
[243:17.90]And when the lives are depleted, it's over.
[243:21.90]Oh, there's a list of incoming characters.
[243:24.38]I mean, I don't know how that's done, but sure, I'll play it.
[243:27.52]Let's just play this first, and then we'll do it after.
[243:29.50]No, I think this is stocks if you guys want a 1v1.
[243:33.32]Seems like he's a little scared about doing it this round.
[243:35.58]I mean, I'll try it.
[243:38.48]You do understand that it's a win-win for me regardless, right?
[243:41.08]Because I'm not a gamer.
[243:41.98]I've never played this game.
[243:42.72]They're totally separate.
[243:43.38]I'm not a gamer either.
[243:44.04]It literally doesn't matter.
[243:45.75]Even if you win, you owned a 31-year-old dude whose community blames him for never playing video games.
[243:56.53]You are hedging every single alternative of you losing with a different excuse.
[244:02.25]Sack up and play your best in win or lose.
[244:06.68]I'm doing that, but also I need you to remember that everything I said is true.
[244:11.66]You bailed on your friends going to Korea.
[244:14.36]What?
[244:15.24]I said you bailed on your friends going to Korea.
[244:17.46]Okay.
[244:18.38]Also, that's not true.
[244:21.88]Sorry.
[244:27.70]How do you turn off items?
[244:31.48]I turned off hazards, but items are still on.
[244:33.44]Oh, God!
[244:34.14]Why am I always holding a sandwich?
[244:40.77]Is that just what I do?
[244:43.87]I just pick one out of the ground every time.
[244:47.68]Oh, you just got the credit for that.
[244:50.88]I don't know.
[244:52.84]I can't tell, so I'm just throwing myself down to see.
[244:55.02]He's just getting every point for those.
[244:59.90]Thank you.
[245:02.04]Thank you for that, Moist.
[245:03.66]Yeah, no problem.
[245:04.32]It's definitely not stocks.
[245:05.66]We can just keep track of stocks.
[245:07.30]We can do like a two-stock game here.
[245:09.43]Sorry.
[245:22.75]Dude, what is happening?
[245:24.53]Can anybody hear me?
[245:25.91]Yeah, yeah.
[245:26.85]Dude, what's going on?
[245:27.81]I got stuck in the void.
[245:29.05]I literally, my facecam is frozen.
[245:31.57]My computer crashed.
[245:37.04]Wait, are you just taking free kills now?
[245:38.94]Because you noticed Jerma's AFK?
[245:40.62]They're irrelevant.
[245:41.44]They're irrelevant.
[245:42.16]What do you mean they're irrelevant?
[245:43.46]I'm here.
[245:43.94]You said he counts stocks.
[245:45.96]Wait, so the rules of the game changed all of a sudden?
[245:48.81]Like, I don't understand.
[245:49.69]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[245:50.55]We're just counting stocks.
[245:53.29]Hello?
[245:54.79]Hey!
[245:59.45]Dude, my webcam is fucked.
[246:02.50]What's going on over there?
[246:03.64]Are we good?
[246:05.44]I don't understand.
[246:06.06]So what are we doing right now?
[246:07.08]So like... So right now you're winning.
[246:09.94]So Ludwig's down a stock, you're up a stock.
[246:12.12]Wait, I have this one for Seth.
[246:14.71]Yeah, but you haven't killed Dasan yet, have you?
[246:16.99]Yeah.
[246:17.89]Oh, you have?
[246:18.31]Oh, it's fine.
[246:19.07]You have?
[246:21.75]That was good, but so is this the fuck Let's go
[246:45.06]Yabba dabba doo.
[246:46.08]What?
[246:46.34]How?
[246:47.38]Yabba dabba doo.
[246:48.30]No, don't take that.
[246:49.40]What the fuck?
[246:51.04]Good honest man.
[246:51.87]Oh, you scumbag.
[246:56.89]Yabba dabba doo.
[246:57.59]Oh my god.
[246:58.79]That hitbox is long.
[247:31.55]Oh, God.
[247:32.17]What the fuck?
[247:32.69]Sorry, guys.
[247:33.61]I had some technical problems.
[247:34.81]No, no, no.
[247:35.85]We're not.
[247:37.01]It's 1v1 anyway.
[247:37.73]Yeah, yeah.
[247:38.59]It's just a 1v1.
[247:38.99]Oh, God.
[247:40.99]I'm going to try to clear all the items myself.
[247:51.02]Shit.
[247:51.74]Oh, fuck.
[247:52.48]I have an angle.
[248:05.29]The box is shrinking.
[248:06.55]Oh, shit!
[248:06.97]No!
[248:08.43]Wait, is that two?
[248:09.49]What are we doing?
[248:09.99]That's two.
[248:10.27]We got one stock left.
[248:11.35]We're doing a three-stock game.
[248:16.13]Oh, Jesus.
[248:19.41]That's it.
[248:20.82]Oh, my God.
[248:24.02]That's game.
[248:25.30]That's game.
[248:31.41]Yeah, that's great.
[248:32.56]Great game.
[248:34.06]Let's play some 2v2s.
[248:37.56]2v2s.
[248:37.64]That's another ring out.
[248:38.52]Do you want more or are you done?
[248:41.28]Oh, I'm jumping to my death every time.
[248:45.08]I like this end of the game here where you get the Fortnite dome.
[248:50.12]Yeah, it's pretty cool, actually.
[248:51.44]I like that a lot.
[248:51.92]There you go.
[248:52.93]You got one, Lud.
[248:53.75]Good job.
[248:55.25]Let's try again.
[248:58.15]And you had the cheesiest character.
[248:59.41]It's fine.
[248:59.89]I mean, it's not a big deal, but like
[249:09.00]I hate how I'm jumping to my death.
[249:12.15]Nice shot.
[249:13.55]I won't let that happen again.
[249:17.63]Is this game similar to Smash Bros., by the way?
[249:19.51]Because, like, I've literally never played it.
[249:21.44]Almost a one-on-one clone.
[249:23.60]Okay.
[249:25.18]Should I play Smash Bros.? ?
[249:26.96]You should.
[249:27.56]You'd like it.
[249:28.24]Hold on.
[249:29.28]Hold on now.
[249:29.76]I love this game.
[249:30.71]Before anybody says anything too drastic here, Smash Ultimate, I'm going to say this right now.
[249:36.67]I want opinions from the people that played a lot of Smash.
[249:39.87]Smash Ultimate has way too much shit on the screen.
[249:45.53]What?
[249:45.79]When you attack somebody, it does these giant particle effect lightning smoke on every single move.
[249:53.05]Are you going to add me to your esports team?
[249:55.94]Yeah, I'll recruit you for the moist esports multiverses squad once we pop off.
[250:01.11]Let's fucking go, dude.
[250:02.23]After I destroyed Ludwig, who I thought was like a professional at this.
[250:06.61]You were looking pretty clean there for a minute, I'm not gonna lie.
[250:11.72]I'm just saying.
[250:12.56]I'm just saying.
[250:14.18]I disagree, Jerma.
[250:16.06]I think it's the... Unless you play with items.
[250:17.86]Are you talking about like with items?
[250:20.31]No, I'm just, okay, so you're gonna notice this now, and you're gonna be like, why the fuck did he have to say that?
[250:25.61]When you do like a regular attack, or a special attack, doesn't matter, it creates this gigantic explosion, a huge smoke, light show explosion, anytime you touch anybody.
[250:37.76]Anytime you move around, it's just like, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke!
[250:40.71]It's a ton of particle effects, and it messes with my head.
[250:43.73]I don't think I've noticed.
[250:44.49]I know there's Sparks.
[250:45.55]So, like, Sparks come out when you deliver an attack that'll probably kill.
[250:49.61]So, like, a really strong attack at a high percent, little Sparks will come out.
[250:54.33]Yeah, like in wave... Not wave dashing.
[250:56.85]Dash dancing.
[250:57.72]You get, like, little smoke that pops up.
[250:59.58]Hey, I'm not saying that Ultimate's a bad game.
[251:01.90]I think it's a great game.
[251:03.12]But if I were to pick my favorite game in the world, it'd be Multiverses.
[251:08.10]Is your ad still going?
[251:10.12]No.
[251:10.30]Oh.
[251:14.35]Hey, I didn't say anything.
[251:15.51]All I said is that I'm an old person and the less stuff on the screen that I have to look at, the better.
[251:22.75]Is this a me gap here?
[251:25.52]Oh, waiting for lobby leader.
[251:27.04]Oh, wait.
[251:27.98]No, you're not even in the lobby.
[251:29.38]It's just me.
[251:30.22]For some reason, it's just me and Jerma in the lobby right now.
[251:33.38]Yeah, I see it too.
[251:35.84]We should restart it.
[251:36.50]We should restart it.
[251:37.14]We should restart it.
[251:37.78]Hold on.
[251:39.84]I'll do another custom game.
[251:41.40]I'll do another custom game lobby and then I'll give it to you.
[251:44.11]I'll hand it off to you.
[251:45.41]Yeah, that's fine.
[251:46.77]Yeah, do that.
[251:47.31]Okay.
[251:49.33]Invited the big moist.
[251:52.84]Ludwig still has not accepted my friend request.
[251:55.07]That's cool.
[251:55.91]Aren't I in here?
[251:56.65]Oh, there we go.
[251:57.57]I'm aircoots31.
[251:58.39]I know.
[252:00.53]We're friends.
[252:01.59]No, we're not.
[252:03.07]In the game.
[252:04.11]Nope, not in real life.
[252:05.29]Why did you specify it like that?
[252:06.58]Are we not friends in real life?
[252:07.60]No, not anymore.
[252:08.96]Oh, okay.
[252:10.12]No, it's cool.
[252:11.06]Oh, I've sent you a friend request.
[252:11.96]You have not accepted it.
[252:13.20]That's not true.
[252:13.86]I sent you one.
[252:14.82]You guys cool with these teams?
[252:15.70]Are we good with this?
[252:17.10]I'm ready to ride.
[252:18.19]Oh, what the fuck?
[252:18.93]I see it now.
[252:19.57]I'm going to bust out the bugs.
[252:23.22]You want bugs?
[252:23.82]Alright, yeah.
[252:24.54]Let's see it.
[252:26.41]I feel like you got a pretty good bug.
[252:27.27]Oh, wait.
[252:27.45]Oh, fuck.
[252:27.89]I forgot to hand it off to you and I just pressed play.
[252:30.79]God damn it.
[252:32.59]Oh, no, no.
[252:33.19]It's all good.
[252:33.77]Back to lobby.
[252:34.25]Back to lobby here.
[252:35.05]No, no, no.
[252:35.79]The settings are right.
[252:36.45]The settings are right.
[252:37.07]You're good.
[252:37.61]You're good.
[252:38.20]Teams 2v2.
[252:39.24]Four ring outs.
[252:39.96]Seven minutes.
[252:40.78]Hazards enabled.
[252:44.06]That's good.
[252:44.46]If we're going 2v2, I gotta play something I know.
[252:47.66]You can play bugs.
[252:50.00]It says you guys are refreshing.
[252:51.98]I exited out and went back to the lobby and I can't start the game again.
[252:55.73]We got to back out.
[252:56.67]We got to back out.
[252:57.71]Back out?
[252:59.45]Yeah.
[253:00.43]And now we can boot it up again.
[253:02.39]No, Moist is still not backed out.
[253:05.47]How do you back out in this?
[253:06.65]Yeah, how do you back out here?
[253:08.53]Just press the B button.
[253:10.16]No, that doesn't work for me.
[253:11.58]Yeah, I think we're in here.
[253:12.56]Alright, leave lobby round two.
[253:18.00]Okay.
[253:18.74]We actually might just get booted.
[253:21.04]Probably.
[253:21.62]Left lobby, gonna restart it.
[253:29.82]Taz is very concerned about how long that was taking.
[253:32.38]There we go.
[253:35.23]Okay, inviting, inviting.
[253:50.08]I think I got a solid another three or four games in me.
[253:53.47]I'll play with Jerma.
[253:56.01]Wait, what happened?
[253:57.81]We're in.
[253:58.03]Do you want to do this?
[253:59.75]We're good, yeah.
[254:01.19]Okay.
[254:01.99]I'm sorry, Jerma.
[254:04.63]Hey, we had a pretty good run.
[254:07.65]Choose your character.
[254:13.10]Oh, I love that.
[254:15.76]Look at this guy.
[254:17.20]Are you guys playing canonical friends?
[254:20.68]uh we both have similar hair color oh that's big yeah and I am I I just I mean the tasmanian devil's not a dog but close it's not that you can oh it makes sense I guess that you can't upgrade like you level up when you're playing 2v2 because your friends will let you cheese right yeah
[254:41.88]I really, I feel like this would be a crossover episode though.
[254:44.72]Like Taz would replace Scooby for some reason.
[254:46.96]And it'd be like really funny.
[254:47.78]He'd pop out of the door one time and then pop out.
[254:50.08]And it'd be Scooby coming back in.
[254:52.55]Oh, the hallway scenes.
[254:53.71]Yeah.
[254:54.59]They eat a lot.
[254:55.37]Doesn't Taz, Taz eats a shitload of food.
[254:57.37]He's perfect for a crossover.
[254:58.75]Bit of a hungry bear.
[255:00.37]Oh my God.
[255:01.21]I hit it too hard.
[255:16.89]What's different about this game mode, Tasmanian Devil is crazy cracked, holy shit.
[255:22.43]Yeah, Tas is kind of scary.
[255:27.39]Watch out for that!
[255:28.37]Oh my, what was that?
[255:29.57]That was my missile.
[255:52.00]oh wait what the what just happened oh I'm dying I'm dying you're fine we're good we're good I'm playing bad nice nice that was that was I think I'm getting even stronger
[256:12.73]Oh, that's a bunch of baloney.
[256:15.39]It really is.
[256:16.07]It's absolute baloney.
[256:16.99]I agree.
[256:19.94]Doing that from off the stage is just, oh, it's horrible to deal with.
[256:24.10]Nice catch.
[256:40.13]Oh, good tosses on.
[256:41.98]Get fucked.

[257:54.12]Yeah, it was the damage.
[257:56.16]But the KOs is the easy part.

[258:00.17]That bug's kind of nuts.

[258:07.90]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[258:10.74]That's pretty good.
[258:11.68]That's hard to break through.
[258:13.62]Yeah, that shit will stun for a minute.
[258:16.14]I am using too many specials.
[258:18.90]I have no idea how to play, like... What is the assassin character?
[258:23.20]Like, how do they...
[258:25.03]I assume they're good at KOs and have a lot of hit moves and are easy to kill.
[258:28.88]Are you?
[258:29.20]Yeah, I don't know.
[258:31.16]I've just been playing bruiser characters or tanks.
[258:34.86]Also, you know what I didn't know beforehand is when you use your dodge, if you use it in succession, it gets worse, right?
[258:42.24]You have a little meter underneath your character.
[258:45.68]Oh, I thought it was just when you land on the ground, it's reset.
[258:48.44]Yeah, you deplete it and it gets shorter and shorter and shorter if you go all the way down.
[258:53.40]That makes sense.
[258:56.49]Which, yeah, makes sense because there's no block, right?
[258:58.61]There's no whole block.
[259:00.62]Right.
[259:00.88]Yeah.
[259:03.98]Dude, I was supposed to, when I got done with the hashtag ad, I was supposed to go back to doing politics because I haven't covered it in a while.
[259:11.58]And I just got totally hooked on this.
[259:14.15]Playing video games with friends is great.
[259:17.29]Well, you're not doing that, so.
[259:19.35]Okay, playing video games with friends plus Ludwig is great.
[259:23.19]I agree.
[259:23.89]It's good.
[259:24.55]Alright, let's go for it.
[259:26.76]Come on.
[259:27.16]First team in universe.
[259:29.28]Oh, it's a knee.
[259:48.12]Oh, shit.
[259:48.60]I didn't even see that coming.
[259:49.65]That was great teamwork right there, Moist.
[259:51.77]Good work.
[259:52.73]I saw that.
[259:56.29]Oh, shit.
[259:56.87]Oh, wow.
[259:57.63]Blood's kind of going in.
[260:03.73]Oh.
[260:06.78]Okay.
[260:07.38]Wait, what?
[260:08.34]Wait, what just happened?
[260:11.30]No, it literally broke.
[260:13.12]Like, I jumped, and then the game... Wait, what is going on right now?
[260:17.74]I did jump.
[260:23.78]My safe didn't get off.
[260:36.31]Oh, no.
[260:40.37]Oh, what the fuck?
[260:46.79]Damn it.
[260:49.72]That was big.
[260:50.92]That was big.
[260:54.72]I don't know what I'm... Oh, fuck.
[260:58.00]Okay, I need a hard carry here, Charlie.
[261:00.72]Alright, hold on.
[261:01.22]I'm coming.
[261:02.98]No, I'm just saying because I suck.
[261:04.80]No, you're fine.
[261:06.72]I am in trouble here.
[261:10.05]Oh, I thought I lived that.
[261:13.91]How am I still alive?
[261:15.69]How are you alive?
[261:16.59]You're the goat.
[261:17.03]You're the goat.
[261:18.84]No, it's over, right?
[261:20.31]What?
[261:21.61]Oh, I missed the bat.
[261:25.23]Dude, what the fuck was that?
[261:26.93]Oh, shit.
[261:27.41]Oh, shit.
[261:27.73]Oh, shit.
[261:53.18]You're so slippery.
[261:54.08]Wait, what?
[262:04.97]Oh my god, you're so slippery.
[262:07.98]Me?
[262:08.28]Oh.
[262:19.74]Come on baby, I'm trying to dial in.
[262:30.96]Oh, oh my god, we can win this Oh Hang in there.
[262:36.14]No, I died.
[262:37.82]It's fine.
[262:38.16]It's fine Dude what the fuck that's done
[262:53.06]Yeah.
[262:54.91]No!
[262:56.29]You got so lucky, lad.
[262:57.49]No.
[262:59.43]No, it's over.
[263:00.87]We got this.
[263:08.66]It was one kick.
[263:09.94]Damn it.
[263:10.52]I got him in the sandwich.
[263:11.38]I got him in the sandwich.
[263:13.21]It's a great finish there.
[263:14.77]That was a big sandwich.
[263:16.83]I played so poorly in the beginning.
[263:18.95]I totally cooked this.
[263:20.51]It's fine.
[263:21.21]No, no, no, no.
[263:22.51]I shouldn't have risked it.
[263:23.59]I shouldn't have risked it.
[263:27.33]Claw's not strong here, Jerma.
[263:30.36]You staying with Shaggy?
[263:32.38]No, I'm gonna switch it up.
[263:35.26]I will too.
[263:37.08]I'll switch it up to... I'm playing Iron Giant again, even though I'm not very good at it.
[263:43.49]No, he's really good.
[263:45.03]This is my last game.
[263:46.69]Alright, LG, LG.
[263:47.79]Alright.
[263:49.99]I gotta get some food.
[263:52.20]Aw, you kinda nutty, lowkey.
[263:53.50]Thank you.
[263:55.17]This is for the marbles.
[263:56.99]Dude, what sucks is Hasan's actually good, but he's able to be like, nah, I'm a political commentator, and so losing four times is bad.
[264:04.69]I'm not good.
[264:05.61]You're fucking insane.
[264:06.17]No, you're actually good.
[264:06.95]You actually seem to be pretty competent, and I think you play well.
[264:09.97]Dude, Iron Giant is cracked out, though.
[264:11.99]This is going to be hard.
[264:12.53]I have no fucking understanding of how this game operates.
[264:16.01]I'm just literally pressing random buttons, bro.
[264:18.43]Your side Bs are godlike.
[264:19.76]Yeah, those side Bs have been clutch.
[264:24.42]What does the side be when you kick someone off the map or something?
[264:27.02]When you do your like omega kicks that swing left and right very far.
[264:30.34]You do it like Superman and Shaggy.
[264:37.57]This one is like really technical and I don't know how to do it.
[264:40.27]I don't know how to like unlock a bunch of the shit.
[264:44.39]It's gonna be really hard.
[264:45.31]I don't really remember what Jake does.
[265:04.07]fuck I went the wrong way I remember this ups oh jeez oh he's in trouble oh wall's open I'm gone what a burly man
[265:32.52]Finish that up.
[265:34.02]I tried.
[265:34.62]I tried.
[265:35.94]Oh, come on.
[265:36.68]There it is.
[265:37.12]I got them both.
[265:37.88]I got them both.
[265:38.96]Oh, what the fuck?
[265:41.08]Oh, he lived that.
[265:45.08]Oh, God.
[265:45.38]I can't believe that hit me.
[265:47.30]Yeah, it was in a bad spot.
[265:50.74]It was like right stuffed on the left side.
[265:53.34]Are you grabbing this game?
[265:55.41]No, right?
[265:56.19]No, only this character can.
[265:57.37]Okay.
[266:01.29]Oh, you got me.
[266:03.61]You got me.
[266:04.05]I was trying to be sneaky.
[266:09.87]Oh, what the fuck?
[266:12.00]Oh, you fucked me up.
[266:15.68]Ooh.
[266:17.84]I'm going to die soon, Jeremy.
[266:21.60]You can't die.
[266:22.16]Cookie coming up.
[266:24.58]Judo chop, man.
[266:34.97]How are you a log?
[266:35.97]It's like a rag doll.
[266:39.53]Match point.
[266:40.77]Red team.
[266:42.35]Oh, I can't let everyone go.
[266:47.57]Oh, that's right.
[266:49.95]Oh, shit.
[266:51.61]Oh, don't you do it.
[266:58.65]Don't you do it.
[267:00.83]Oh, no.
[267:01.11]What?
[267:04.51]He came out.
[267:04.99]He's a genius.
[267:09.45]No.
[267:11.71]Oh, no.
[267:12.13]Oh, shit.
[267:15.27]Finish it off.
[267:15.77]Finish it off.
[267:16.83]I'm trying to grab.
[267:17.80]I'm trying to grab.
[267:18.30]I hit him.
[267:20.26]Yes.
[267:20.44]No.
[267:21.54]It was not.
[267:21.98]It's over.
[267:22.66]Oh, fuck.
[267:23.34]He got out of it.
[267:24.00]How?
[267:25.82]He's so close.
[267:26.40]No.
[267:26.84]Get him.
[267:27.20]He got me.
[267:28.36]No.
[267:31.80]I couldn't get there in time.
[267:33.26]Fuck.
[267:34.26]Oh my god.
[267:35.78]Unlucky.
[267:38.74]That right side broke at the worst possible time.
[267:42.78]Dude, the amount of damage.
[267:44.45]Bro, what was I doing?
[267:47.67]Damn, Hasan was stacking on those numbers.
[267:50.19]You would just stand still and spin and grab.
[267:52.93]It would be a hundred damage, but I don't think you can kill.
[267:57.09]Yeah, I couldn't finish off, uh, Jerma at the end there.
[268:00.15]I got, I got towards the end, but just missed it.
[268:01.93]I was trying to grab him at the end.
[268:03.05]I was trying to grab him so I could fucking do the toss.
[268:05.57]It's your, it's your job, right, Charlie?
[268:07.39]Because I don't think Iron Giant can even kill.
[268:09.77]I don't know.
[268:10.17]I don't know anything about Iron Giant.
[268:11.31]I bounced around.
[268:12.19]I bounced up, down, up, down like three times at the end.
[268:14.75]If, if that roof was, was any, if it was there for any shorter, I would be dead.
[268:20.11]Yeah, the map, the map definitely was a bit, it's a bit of a map cap there.
[268:24.30]That was awesome.
[268:24.68]That was a lot of fun.
[268:25.92]Alright.
[268:26.40]Same time next week?
[268:28.08]Yeah.
[268:28.42]Same time next week, boys.
[268:29.57]MultiVersus.
[268:30.33]Let's go.
[268:30.71]I will grind every single day, eight hours a day.
[268:35.27]Hey, man, maybe next time we 1v1, like, you can actually, I don't know, like, be competitive.
[268:41.19]I'm going to lie in bed, eyes wide open, thinking about every single hit that happened to me.
[268:46.76]He's going to read the, what's the, goddammit, I saw it on Twitter.
[268:49.78]People were reading, like, the metas or attacks.
[268:53.84]I'm skipping ahead.
[268:54.70]I'm just going to get Andrew Tate's Hustler University course.
[268:58.12]Oh, yeah, baby.
[268:59.04]I'm coming back at top G or I'm not coming back at all.
[269:02.87]Go read the wiki, bro.
[269:04.31]I'll see you guys later.
[269:05.11]A lot of fun.
[269:05.85]See you later, Jerma.
[269:06.41]Thanks for playing.
[269:06.85]Yeah, thank you, Jerma.
[269:07.55]A lot of fun.
[269:08.27]This was a lot of fun, everybody.
[269:09.47]Thank you, Jerma.
[269:10.57]Errors.
[269:11.75]No, that was a lot of fun.
[269:13.17]We should do it again sometime.
[269:14.77]Absolutely.
[269:15.77]That was good to me.
[269:17.61]Take it easy, guys.
[269:18.05]Have a good night.
[269:19.15]See you later.
[269:21.87]That was fun.
[269:22.87]That was fun.
[269:23.49]That was fun.
[269:26.82]Yeah, so that's Multiversus.
[269:28.76]Again, thanks to Warner Brothers Interactive for sponsoring the stream.
[269:31.83]We played it for a long time.
[269:33.59]How long was the stream?
[269:34.21]How long was I playing?
[269:36.69]Six hours?
[269:37.23]Damn.
[269:40.83]Hope you had fun.
[269:42.89]Streaming for long enough.
[269:43.63]Hopefully some of you guys got the drop into early access.
[269:52.07]Damn, it feels good sometimes.
[269:53.53]Just playing.
[269:58.29]And I'll see you guys later.
[269:59.58]I will see you guys on Friday for... Sorcery.
[270:04.98]We're going back to Sorcery this weekend.
[270:07.78]For one million Twitch followers.
[270:10.52]It's one of the first games I ever played on stream.
[270:14.00]Should be a good time to hang out and chill.
[270:17.02]We're going back to Sorcery.
[270:18.86]For those of you that weren't here at the beginning of the stream, yeah.
[270:20.95]We're going back to Sorcery.
[270:24.79]And then, green screen movie night is Sunday.
[270:28.53]So we got some pretty fun stuff coming up this weekend.
[270:32.70]Thank you so much for watching, everybody.
[270:34.50]There was a lot of people here earlier.
[270:36.56]Hopefully it was entertaining.
[270:39.30]It was a really cool opportunity, so I'm glad I was able to do it.
[270:43.47]Thanks again to Warner Brothers.
[270:44.97]Interactive.
[270:47.29]Good night.
[270:48.57]Goodbye.
[270:49.03]Actually, we'll do this.
[270:52.23]Do the actual leaving thing.
[270:58.24]Obviously, thanks for the subs.
[271:00.94]I think if they're still playing, go spread out to their channels.
[271:05.00]Obviously.
[271:06.90]Hasan.
[271:08.96]Charlie.
[271:10.12]Ludwig.
[271:10.48]I think they're probably going to keep playing.
[271:12.30]Go spread out.
[271:13.15]Go hang out.
[271:15.25]Not going to rate anybody in particular, I don't think.
[271:21.31]I don't have the drop yet.
[271:22.37]No.
[271:23.61]How much more time do you need?
[271:25.78]Do you need, like, five minutes?
[271:27.18]Two minutes?
[271:28.02]How much more time for the drop?
[271:31.54]I think there are other streamers that are doing this that have the drop enabled, so you can just do it there, too.
[271:38.41]Does it carry over?
[271:43.67]Ugh.
[271:44.71]I'm like a lightning rod right now.
[271:46.17]It's like gaming, man.
[271:47.56]Just playing games and just like, ugh.
[271:49.46]That kind of bottled up gamer energy.
[271:52.40]You know what I'm talking about, right?
[271:55.19]It feels good.
[272:04.99]It does carry over.
[272:06.59]You don't need to do it in one go.
[272:07.83]Oh, there you go.
[272:08.51]So just go watch somebody else that has drops enabled.
[272:15.34]We will absolutely be playing this again.
[272:16.72]There's not a chance I don't do this again.
[272:27.01]You turned 25 during this stream?
[272:28.73]Well, happy birthday.
[272:29.67]Happy 25th birthday.
[272:31.79]Come on.
[272:33.67]I just burped.
[272:42.53]Yeah, and we'll see you Friday.
[272:44.76]Good night.
[272:45.34]Goodbye.
[272:46.12]Take care of yourselves.
[272:47.78]Call your mother.
[272:49.06]You know how it works.
[272:51.40]Thanks for watching.
[272:51.94]Thanks for supporting the stream.
[272:53.30]All the subs, obviously.
[272:55.66]Have a great night.
[272:57.61]See you later.
[273:19.49]you
[273:54.38]you
[274:24.91]you
