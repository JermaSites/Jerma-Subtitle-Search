[ve:61.1.100]

[00:07.73]Hey, what's up?
[00:13.68]How you doing?
[00:18.80]Squeaks and I are currently just chilling.
[00:22.15]I think his stream crashed.
[00:25.35]His stream crashed.
[00:27.54]We had to set up Ubisoft accounts to play Family Feud.
[00:31.99]Oh, spoiler alert.
[00:34.27]Today we're playing Switch games with uh, with Squeaks.
[00:43.06]I don't have a Switch 2, no I don't.
[00:47.04]I have, I have, this is a retro channel.
[00:50.47]I'm using a Switch 1.
[00:53.85]Does fam- will this even work?
[00:56.05]For the Switch 2?
[00:57.51]I don't- probably not.
[00:58.94]Does everything work for the Switch 2 backwards compatible?
[01:10.25]Almost everything?
[01:11.25]Okay.
[01:13.82]Well, I really don't necessarily care about the 3.5 FPS I'll gain on Family Feud.
[01:24.12]Let's see.
[01:24.46]How's he doing?
[01:26.26]Oh, I really... Are you there?
[01:30.99]Hello?
[01:31.58]So I realized you muted and deafened your microphone.
[01:36.93]I do apologize.
[01:37.91]I sat down.
[01:38.85]I didn't realize I wasn't muted on your stream and I was going like... And then I saw the deafened.
[01:47.93]I was like, oh shit, he just deafened me.
[01:49.93]That must have been annoying.
[01:51.42]No, it was just, I just didn't want to be disrespectful.
[01:53.31]Like, what if you, like, you know, said something or whatever.
[01:56.52]I didn't want you to not know.
[01:57.80]I was being polite.
[02:00.25]Like, what if you said, what if you, like, fucking streamed today or something?
[02:03.70]Oh, yeah.
[02:04.06]Like, I rarely tell people how I feel.
[02:06.73]Yeah, like an internal monolog before you go live.
[02:09.79]Or like a motivational, like, you can do this.
[02:13.00]You are amazing.
[02:14.54]And then you go live.
[02:16.52]That's a sign of a good friend.
[02:17.42]I appreciate that.
[02:18.97]Yeah, I got you.
[02:19.63]I'm glad you did, because I said all kinds of fucked up shit the second you deafened.
[02:25.59]That's what I assumed, Jeremiah.
[02:26.78]That's why I did it.
[02:27.44]I know your character.
[02:29.22]You seem like the kind of guy that would do that.
[02:31.75]Alright, did your computer crash?
[02:34.22]Did your stream crash?
[02:35.08]Did your Switch 2 crash?
[02:36.78]Are you on Switch 2?
[02:37.36]My microphone broke.
[02:38.74]Yeah, I'm on the Switch 2.
[02:40.20]Are you?
[02:40.38]Oh!
[02:40.81]No, dude, I'm a retro guy.
[02:42.77]We do retro stuff here.
[02:43.77]I'm on a Switch 1.
[02:45.29]Oh my god.
[02:45.97]Wait, do you have even the Animal Crossing Joy-Cons?
[02:48.51]Or are you talking like red and blue?
[02:51.64]These ones are black, but they're not mine.
[02:54.70]Mine are red and blue.
[02:57.11]Oh.
[02:57.61]Oh, so it's not an OLED?
[03:00.44]no it's it's whatever one uh that came out in 2016. you should get a switch too it has so many good games yeah I don't really want to pay a thousand dollars to play Mario Kart oh and donkey kong bonanza that's true I've heard two games and you you you played it right
[03:20.44]Oh, I can't get over how good Donkey Kong is.
[03:23.96]Is it actually good?
[03:24.70]Do you like it?
[03:25.51]It's incredible.
[03:26.51]It's so fun.
[03:27.71]I thought it was going to be terrible, and then I was surprised.
[03:30.59]Okay.
[03:32.01]I believe you.
[03:32.75]A huge recommend.
[03:34.64]And the Switch 1 still has the game we're about to play.
[03:37.62]Should we leak it?
[03:39.62]Oh, I already leaked it because I talked about the Ubisoft stuff.
[03:43.29]No.
[03:43.37]Okay, Family Feud.
[03:45.31]Hey, guys, get excited.
[03:46.47]It's the Squeaks family versus the Jerma family.
[03:50.88]tonight that'd be who's uh who's your favorite family feud host oh it's gotta be Louis Anderson I like Steve Harvey I feel like he's like kind of mean sometimes which I like yeah like he has a good turn to the camera where he's like someone says something really embarrassing and he goes come on I feel like he does that a lot though I feel like that's become his his thing to a point where now he like has to do it
[04:16.33]Yeah, but that's so fun.
[04:17.45]Like that's his like signature.
[04:19.09]I think that's cool.
[04:20.31]Yeah, it's a little corporate now.
[04:22.24]Like there's like a Steve Harvey Samsung moment and he just turns to the camera every time.
[04:28.44]Are you alright?
[04:28.96]Can I invite you?
[04:29.95]Like it says I can create a room and invite you apparently.
[04:34.53]Okay.
[04:34.95]So what happens if I press this?
[04:36.53]We hide our screens.
[04:39.02]Yeah, maybe hide the screen for now.
[04:41.32]And like just to make sure this doesn't say anything like we are.
[04:43.24]Apparently it says connecting.
[04:44.64]I don't know.
[04:46.13]uh okay hold on let me just invite my friend to play um I can't find a controller hold on hold on this is a nightmare when I click on you it says connecting connecting connecting connecting and then it just stops here we go um that's not a good sign are we sure this game even like is on
[05:09.67]Can we, like, play the game online?
[05:12.44]I imagine you can, right?
[05:14.30]It says connecting.
[05:15.12]Maybe you have to, like, accept the connection in the multiplayer mode.
[05:17.98]There's, like, a couch versus couch, apparently.
[05:19.89]That's what it's called.
[05:21.51]Oh, yes.
[05:22.15]I did see that.
[05:23.89]So if you go to that, and then do you see me looking for you on here?
[05:29.94]Let's see.
[05:32.61]Is the menu lagging for you?
[05:35.20]I'm on the Switch 2, you're playing retro.
[05:37.61]Oh, here we go.
[05:38.85]Play a friend.
[05:39.89]Okay, it's taking longer than normal to connect, please.
[05:42.19]Why is it telling me that I'm connecting to you when you haven't even accepted it?
[05:46.12]I did not get an invite.
[05:48.12]Okay, so... Let me see.
[05:50.58]I pressed it.
[05:52.99]Connecting.
[05:55.15]Wait, are we doing like menu Mondays?
[05:57.01]It's supposed to be Switch Sundays.
[05:59.08]I'm just so confused.
[06:01.09]Oh, I see.
[06:02.11]Did you get it?
[06:02.65]Something is loaded, but it wasn't from you.
[06:04.53]Oh, what?
[06:06.74]Should I try creating a room?
[06:08.88]Yeah, maybe create a room.
[06:10.00]Let's try that.
[06:10.44]Create a room and then see if you can just bring me in.
[06:15.99]Okay.
[06:17.37]Single.
[06:19.26]And then you have to create your family team.
[06:20.66]Did you do this?

[06:35.67]Oh, like so many.
[06:36.79]And usually when I'm sick.
[06:38.40]Okay, well, that's the experience, right?
[06:39.70]The experience is how many episodes of Family Feud have you watched just with your mouth open on the couch?
[06:44.56]It's probably at least five to 10 back to back every time.

[17:13.51]We asked 100 people to follow.
[17:15.23]It's like parent trap, by the way.
[17:16.91]Name two sisters who can't handle much response.
[17:21.47]No way!
[17:22.44]There's lag!
[17:23.40]I was spamming!
[17:25.48]I already got them all in the bag.
[17:35.09]Fish?
[17:36.95]You don't feed your fish?
[17:38.29]Oh my god, neither does the world.
[17:39.79]Oh shit.
[17:40.47]Wait, this is going to be so specific.
[17:42.29]Okay, I don't want to say them out loud unless I'm going to do them, otherwise you'll steal them.
[17:46.04]Um, hermit crab.
[17:48.32]Um, snail.
[17:50.27]Why am I saying them?
[17:50.91]I haven't even decided if I'm going to play it.
[17:53.41]Uh, play.
[17:54.09]Okay, let's get back to your game.
[17:55.48]Oh, that's helpful.
[17:55.88]Hermit crab.
[17:57.06]Snail.
[17:59.02]Not a whole lot of responsibility.
[18:00.94]Bird is a ton of responsibility.
[18:02.90]Cats and dogs are a lot of... I feel like having a snail is a responsibility too, no?
[18:06.39]Like you have to feed it still.
[18:08.11]You know what?
[18:08.97]Let's say like gerbil.
[18:12.48]What?
[18:14.42]Will this even be on here?
[18:15.20]Gerbil is so much responsibility.
[18:17.11]But it is, but it's like a lot less than like a dog, right?
[18:21.70]Yeah, true, true.
[18:22.60]Okay, yeah.
[18:23.72]That's fair.
[18:24.24]Hamster, gerbil...
[18:26.58]It's like a pet rock.
[18:27.88]Does that not count?
[18:29.32]That'd be funny.
[18:30.55]Alright, it's going to be that snail.
[18:34.41]A pet snail.
[18:35.58]That's so easy.
[18:36.52]Bugs, like a pet bug.
[18:38.62]Pet bug.
[18:48.23]Pet snail.
[18:49.41]If pet rock is up there, I really am going to be pissed.
[18:51.93]I'm just going to be completely honest.
[18:53.39]I don't know anyone who has a snail as a pet.
[18:57.82]But it's like a no responsibility.
[18:59.68]I had a pet snail when I was a little kid.
[19:02.32]Snail.
[19:05.24]Shove it up your ass, game.
[19:07.71]It's a pet snail.
[19:09.65]Look at my family doing an X. They hate you.
[19:14.07]They're all laughing at snail.
[19:16.21]It's so toxic.
[19:19.60]I mean, it is going to be rock, isn't it?
[19:21.86]It's going to be rock.
[19:24.00]But you can't see.
[19:24.67]I shouldn't have said rock.
[19:25.87]You shouldn't have, but it is.
[19:26.69]It's probably an amphibian, like a frog.
[19:30.28]Frog seems like, we have to like mist a frog.
[19:33.48]I'm saying rock.
[19:34.84]Some random idiot's going to say it.
[19:36.97]Like you just said.
[19:38.15]You mean me?
[19:40.89]there's got to be more random idiots in the world all the intellectuals have pet snails of course it's not even out there dude that's a class you just got family feuded I just fed you with fake information just because I knew you were going to use it and I called you an idiot apparently yeah yeah we're in drama I guess okay alright
[20:02.24]what about like hamster is that maybe more common like maybe they wrote hamster instead of uh if hamster's up there and gerbil's not up there I will throw a fit it's that's okay I'm gonna guess hamster though it's gonna be hamster and I wrote gerbil that's like said with confidence here we go feeling it again
[20:29.93]Hamster and gerbil are... It should be hamster slash gerbil.
[20:34.72]Why would it be... No, I don't know.
[20:37.12]I just feel like gerbil is so... I don't know.
[20:40.95]I just don't recognize that as like a real pet.
[20:43.79]A hamster, however, that feels professional.
[20:46.10]A bird?
[20:46.88]What the fuck?
[20:47.72]Birds are a lot of work.
[20:49.84]I would have never guessed a bird.
[20:51.72]Turtle.
[20:52.79]Isn't it?
[20:53.27]I mean, a turtle.
[20:54.01]Yeah, turtles.
[20:54.97]But I feel like a lot of the reptiles and amphibians are kind of our work.
[20:57.91]Cat.
[20:58.65]cats at work too what are they talking about these are just neglectful owners like I don't understand I guess like you think of a cat as less maintenance than a dog like usually the conversation is like should we get a dog nah yeah it's like oh and cats dogs are like crazy and wild and cats just sit there and they're super smart and independent
[21:21.65]Yeah, and they just take naps and you don't have to go take them for a walk.
[21:25.24]I get it now.
[21:26.38]Alright.
[21:27.42]This is hard.
[21:28.40]This game is hard.
[21:29.40]I'm not going to get blown out again because of semantics.
[21:31.66]Okay.
[21:31.94]Gerbil.
[21:33.11]Gerbil.
[21:33.75]Hamster.

[21:40.07]We've got four answers to find.
[21:41.78]No, it's not how at the moon.
[21:43.22]It was how moon.
[21:44.10]To the next level with double points.
[21:47.42]You can't add words from 100 people for this question.

[22:26.40]Is a doctor the same as surgeon?
[22:30.08]No comment.

[23:02.78]You can't do that.
[23:04.54]Okay, but that was just the only one.
[23:06.62]That was the only one.
[23:08.11]Let's see if the board's got it.
[23:11.45]I was going to say pilot.
[23:14.14]Alright, minimize your chat window.
[23:16.25]But no, if we do this for six hours, we're not going to communicate at all.
[23:20.97]That's alright.
[23:22.35]Alright, minimize window.
[23:24.44]Okay, I'm going to go for Surgeon.
[23:26.08]Is that crazy?
[23:27.88]Come on, we're on the same team here.
[23:30.09]Our families are identical.
[23:31.65]How do I spell Surgeon?
[23:34.15]Surgery.
[23:35.61]It's like Surgeon.
[23:38.04]They didn't have it.
[23:38.98]Wait, Surgery?
[23:41.04]Surgery.
[23:41.80]Surgery.
[23:43.37]That's not an occupation.
[23:45.53]Oh, my God.
[23:46.91]Oh, I'm going to win this one.
[23:49.86]I already got one.
[23:52.16]OK, wait, you can't have a room for error where there's no surgeon.
[23:57.22]But I just said that one doctor.
[24:00.83]What's another one?
[24:03.09]Wait, that might add.
[24:04.07]No, I don't like that one.
[24:05.61]No room for error.
[24:09.10]Should I do teacher?
[24:12.87]I don't know.
[24:13.97]I mean, I feel like there's so much room for error if you're a teacher.
[24:20.15]I can't think of anyone.
[24:21.15]I'm running out of time.
[24:24.56]Is it there?
[24:26.60]Teacher.
[24:28.34]I don't even know how to write this.

[24:43.99]Oh, architect.
[24:45.51]Oh, my God.
[24:46.41]An architect.
[24:47.23]That's genius.
[24:48.69]That is so good.
[24:49.91]I was going to say like a construction manager or like an architect or something.
[24:53.82]Oh, no.
[24:55.14]I hope you wait.
[24:56.34]I got number three.

[25:04.01]No room for error.
[25:06.01]Factory worker.
[25:07.51]Factory.
[25:08.19]Like a factory foreman or something.
[25:10.17]Factory worker.
[25:11.95]There's room for error.
[25:13.27]I don't know.
[25:15.03]Dentist.
[25:17.01]Dentist.
[25:17.91]I bet you dentists make so many mistakes all the time.
[25:20.14]They just don't, they just don't say anything.
[25:24.08]Dentist.
[25:24.88]You're getting a teeth whitening and you use like the wrong toothpaste.
[25:28.45]Yeah.
[25:28.97]I'm sorry, man.
[25:29.45]You get like a filling and they drill up into your mouth.
[25:31.57]That's bad.
[25:32.21]That is error.
[25:33.70]Yeah, but you can still come back from that.
[25:35.34]It's not life or death.
[25:37.02]A math.
[25:38.86]Somebody works with things that need math.
[25:40.53]Like a lot of math.
[25:41.89]That has to be exact.
[25:44.07]Like a CPA.
[25:45.29]Yeah.
[25:46.15]But accountant is good, but is it up there?
[25:51.90]I feel like if an accountant fucks up your taxes, that's bad, right?
[25:57.38]If you get caught, but it can save you a lot of money.
[26:00.17]Oh, okay.
[26:02.23]Like there's no room for error.
[26:04.64]Is that it?
[26:07.61]What the fuck?
[26:10.86]Was it factory worker?
[26:12.12]What did my chat say?
[26:15.49]Astronaut.
[26:16.37]Astronaut.
[26:18.45]Oh, that's a good one.
[26:19.41]Lifeguard.
[26:20.29]Astronaut, of course.
[26:21.58]An accountant, dude.
[26:22.90]He can fuck up your whole life.
[26:24.08]What's the fourth answer?
[26:25.52]Yeah, but he could also help you with an error.
[26:30.15]Show me the number three answer.
[26:32.49]Yeah, sure.
[26:33.87]Air traffic controller.
[26:36.31]This is three each.
[26:37.29]That is so rough.
[26:38.60]That is so silly.
[26:40.28]Three each.
[26:43.56]Did anyone in your chat say bomb diffuser?
[26:46.05]I doubt it.
[26:47.43]I doubt it.
[26:48.78]I feel like that would get auto-monitored.
[26:51.50]You are sweeping me right now.
[26:53.14]I have to fix this.
[26:55.20]I mean, this was your game, Jerma.
[26:59.23]It's a triple points now.
[27:00.85]You can come back.
[27:01.65]I can come back.
[27:02.27]This is a warm-up round anyways.

[27:05.04]Yeah, I know.
[27:06.18]This is a marathon.
[27:07.90]I'm just getting comfortable.

[27:54.08]I... Wait, what?
[28:02.04]Is it my turn?
[28:02.88]Yeah, because you can get higher, I guess.
[28:04.89]Because it's the triple point round.
[28:05.93]Oh, I see.
[28:10.45]Don't people do like mud masks?
[28:13.02]Yeah, I mean, there's like spas, like you could jump and play in the mud, you could mold it.
[28:17.72]But no one jumps in the spa, in the mud for a spa.
[28:22.09]I don't know, oh my god, I have no clue.
[28:28.36]Mud space?
[28:30.12]They didn't have spa.
[28:31.50]They didn't have spa, Jeremiah.

[29:06.74]No, that's what I should have done.
[29:14.81]Oh, five?
[29:15.99]What is higher than that?
[29:18.81]What do people do in the mud?
[29:20.60]Like, work.

[29:24.26]You have to, like, dig it out for, like, construction?
[29:26.88]Yeah, but, like, think about that.
[29:28.15]People are going to jump in the mud to get mud to sculpt?

[30:24.67]Like forage?
[30:25.58]Is there like foraging you can do?
[30:26.74]I don't think so.
[30:28.90]Maybe there's foraging.
[30:30.00]I don't know.
[30:30.52]Have you ever like jumped in the mud before, Jerma?
[30:34.56]This is not even a fucking possible answer.

[31:05.71]I'm gonna say sculpt.
[31:08.24]No, what?
[31:09.32]That doesn't make any sense.
[31:10.68]Yeah, because it's not mud, it's clay.
[31:14.69]No, you're right.
[31:15.75]Sculpt?

[32:10.61]That's... I assume that like playing.
[32:13.45]Yeah.
[32:15.47]What do people do in the mud?
[32:16.43]Only 35 seconds, dude.
[32:22.32]Oh, yeah, that's fine.
[32:22.90]That's so much time.
[32:24.50]In the mud, what do I do?
[32:26.13]And I have 28 seconds.

[33:24.60]Like driving in the mud is playing in the mud.
[33:27.21]No, driving would be driving, but like playing in the mud is like, let's wrestle in the mud.
[33:30.93]Let's jump in the mud.
[33:31.97]To me, that's all of it.
[33:33.58]Yeah.

[33:55.18]Everybody talks shit until they're the one holding the controller.
[33:57.25]You know that, right?
[33:58.49]Yeah, it's like watching Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

[42:36.60]It's time to actually get this rolling.
[42:39.53]Okay, so this one counts.
[42:40.57]We should have to go like this for five seconds.
[42:42.91]Whoever does it faster gets the buzzer.
[42:44.17]That's what I did the first time, but I didn't know you could cut off the host.
[42:50.26]So...
[42:51.44]Why do they run so weirdly?
[42:52.93]They run like a weird old PS1 mocap style.
[42:57.15]It's very odd.
[42:59.15]And all the graphics in the game are like GIFs.
[43:02.00]It's like a different resolution.
[43:04.40]I like it.
[43:05.00]It's charming.

[43:21.68]I mean, how could they finish that sentence where it's not?
[43:25.38]Donuts is the answer.
[43:26.36]That's actually could be true.
[43:30.06]God damn it.

[44:02.95]What else comes in a dozen?
[44:08.60]Bagels, maybe?
[44:08.90]I have no idea.
[44:10.32]A dozen bagels is so much.
[44:13.66]That's a lot.
[44:14.16]Yeah, but usually... That's a lot.
[44:15.75]You can't really buy... I guess you can buy like one bagel.

[44:37.94]Why am I writing turtle?
[44:39.10]Don't write turtle.
[44:40.93]No, no, no, no.

[44:43.71]A dozen turtles because they're the easiest pet to take care of.

[45:54.53]Sometimes, it depends.
[45:56.49]If it's fancy?
[45:58.19]True.
[45:59.09]I'm going to say chocolates.
[46:03.88]Is it okay if I write chocolate?
[46:05.40]Like, is they going to get it, right?
[46:06.91]Oh, no, they won't.

[46:41.92]That's a dozen inches.
[46:43.40]You don't need a dozen inches of bread sometimes.
[46:45.06]You just want like a half of a six-incher.

[48:26.65]It sucks.
[48:27.92]And it goes out every, like, two months.
[48:30.92]It's such a waste of money.
[48:32.86]That sucks.
[48:34.19]Yeah, it's horrible.

[52:15.15]Hemorrhoid pain.
[52:19.58]Liver pain.
[52:20.42]You wrote heartburn.
[52:21.76]We wrote back pain, headache.
[52:24.20]If they're not up there, it's going to be specific shit.
[52:26.73]You want quick relief from hemorrhoids.
[52:29.99]Hemorrhoid pain?
[52:30.95]That sounds so weird.
[52:33.53]Doctor, I've got a hemorrhoid pain.
[52:35.47]That sucks.
[52:37.86]It's up there, dude.
[52:38.80]It's actually like a thing you can write.
[52:40.40]Holy shit.
[52:42.34]Then it probably is.
[52:43.60]Let's see if that's a correct answer.
[52:47.11]Hemorrhoids.
[52:51.24]I didn't like how he said it.
[52:53.00]Hemorrhoids.
[52:55.00]He was excited.
[52:57.54]He wound that one up.
[52:59.87]I'm going to need a guess from you.
[53:08.02]this is throwing me off so bad because like it's like I have no idea what if I just write like physical pain like well is it like oh physical pain what about emotional pain though I I don't physical pain that's what you're going with like are people taking it very literally like oh well the physical kind I don't know I I I don't know what what the hell are these we've done so many good answers I put heartburn so I want to put a headache
[53:37.17]You already did headache, didn't you?
[53:38.67]I did headache.
[53:39.87]I'm screwed.
[53:41.07]I have nothing to put down.
[53:42.33]Why did I tell you you already did that?
[53:44.60]Oh, what about toothache?
[53:47.12]Cavity?
[53:48.08]Cavity pain?
[53:51.13]I don't... If back pain is not up there and teeth pain is up there, I'm going to freak out.
[53:56.53]Toothache.
[54:02.07]Toothache.
[54:02.99]It's going to be up there.
[54:03.76]It's probably going to be number one.
[54:06.66]Oh, he said yes.
[54:07.98]Oh, 100%.
[54:14.89]Apparently, toothache is more common than back pain.
[54:19.09]Maybe they put a different word for back pain because I thought back pain was going to be number one.
[54:23.96]I'm surprised by that.
[54:25.22]So number one is going to be like 80.
[54:27.48]It's going to be huge.
[54:28.58]This is going to be a monstrous number up there.
[54:32.33]Cold pain.
[54:34.01]Cold pain.
[54:35.24]What are these answers?
[54:40.09]I said finances.
[54:41.43]Why does that not count?
[54:42.52]That is a little different because finances could mean a lot of things.
[54:46.84]I wrote back pain what what do you mean it's not up there back pain I didn't write the word pain I just don't like that you are poking holes in the integrity of family feud you wrote headache and it didn't go in wait this is actually you're right let's see wait I'm pissed now it's up you're gonna need wait is it because I only put head and not headache oh you lied
[55:12.21]you got me I don't know man Steve Harvey would have given that to you if it's like oh your head like head pain he would have been like okay he would have and then he would have had like a funny look into the camera oh man I hate this new guy man this new guy is really stingy I don't like this guy and he has like weird I feel like he like his commentary is a little strange
[55:33.79]Remember, he said, I married Mrs. Wright.
[55:37.53]I didn't know her first name was always.
[55:39.44]He just randomly said that.
[55:41.48]I didn't even hear that.
[55:42.70]When you put white, what do you put?
[55:44.50]Spouse.
[55:45.58]Just that little side comment.
[55:47.10]Would you still talk to me if I had this exact hair that he has?
[55:49.71]With the white hair?
[55:51.87]And have the dyed up top, maybe?
[55:54.97]No, actually, I wouldn't.
[55:56.53]You don't think so?
[55:57.84]No, that would be the end of it.
[55:59.18]Switch Sundays are canceled then.
[56:01.58]Okay, name something people do around the house in their underwear.

[61:44.56]It's a classic trope.
[61:46.51]Oh, of course.
[61:51.85]I knew this.
[61:52.84]You would have just stolen like 200 points.

[62:03.33]yeah I mean sometimes like have you ever tried flossing oh yeah many times okay good yeah yeah but I'd never do it in public like I realized I can't nowhere near as painful as it sounds it's fun it's fun to just play around in your underwear right yeah oh no I wasn't just in my underwear though you just added oh wait you mean like I wasn't okay no I was just talking about in general
[62:29.37]Hey, hey, hey, hey, you ever take your underwear, you ever take like your underwear and like, and like pull it out and just like snap, like snap yourself just for fun.
[62:36.82]Oh yeah, all the time.
[62:37.76]You know, you put your fingers in, you like ring, ring, ring out, let go, snap.
[62:42.30]And it just is like a little wake up.
[62:44.52]It's just like a little, oh, look, ooh, ooh.
[62:47.99]Whoops.
[62:48.71]It's like a little pin.
[62:49.81]Oh, wait, what?
[62:50.39]Name something you enter feet with.
[62:51.89]Wait, we didn't put A. Uh, slide.
[63:01.99]we have an answer time to check the slide is an interesting one what is that it's a slide yeah but I think they mean like metaphorically right no they mean uh when you go is everybody going face first doing superman style no but like they mean like I think like uh you go in feet first into like a new is this is this am I misinterpreting this
[63:26.76]I mean, you go ahead and write new job and get an X. Like, cautiously?
[63:31.07]Like a pool, maybe?
[63:33.61]Oh, actually, pool is pretty good.
[63:37.78]Like, instead of diving?
[63:41.42]Okay.
[63:41.88]Yeah!
[63:44.29]How does a slide... Like, a slide is not there.
[63:51.39]I've never heard of, like, jump into a... Go down the slide feet first.
[63:56.44]What am I thinking of head first?
[63:57.91]Now I'm getting confused.
[63:58.99]No, you say that to... It was a snapping underwear comment.
[64:01.95]Now my brain just feels... You say that to your nephew who's gone down the slide two or three times Superman style and it's dangerous.
[64:08.64]So you say, you get up there and you go down that slide feet first.
[64:10.82]You understand, young man?
[64:12.61]Gotcha.
[64:12.89]And that's going to be a common experience for most of America, right?
[64:16.17]To their nephew.
[64:17.83]You sit down and listen to me.
[64:19.22]You go down that slide feet first.
[64:22.32]I hate when that happens.
[64:25.46]Feet first.
[64:28.22]Uh, um... A ball pit.
[64:37.17]Will this pop up on his screen?
[64:40.04]Ball... Wait, am I getting banned from the Ubisoft thing?
[64:46.06]Am I gonna get kicked out?
[64:48.19]Oh my god, it actually showed up.
[64:51.29]The survey says... Ball pit!
[64:56.28]Ball pit?
[64:57.69]How is that not slide?
[64:58.73]You don't accept slide, but you accept ball pit?
[65:01.67]Because you jump into the ball.
[65:03.33]Listen, I have my own nephew, and he always jumps into the ball pit head first.
[65:07.96]You're telling me it's not a common thing?
[65:09.72]And what do you have to tell him?
[65:12.64]Listen, Akshay, you've got to put jump into the ball pit feet first.
[65:17.49]Exactly.
[65:18.13]You get it.
[65:18.97]Yeah.
[65:19.61]Okay, wait.
[65:21.95]Job.
[65:22.88]I don't know.
[65:23.68]I'm getting nervous.
[65:26.29]A job interview.
[65:27.61]No.
[65:30.17]Feet first?
[65:31.81]I misclicked.
[65:32.25]Answer accepted.
[65:34.90]Is that one of the ones we're still looking for?
[65:36.78]Oh, my other suggestion's not up there.
[65:38.76]Oh, I'm embarrassed.
[65:44.13]Job, what a stupid answer.
[65:45.65]I always do this.
[65:46.53]I always put the stupidest thing up there.
[65:48.15]I'll never make it big in the family feud biz.
[65:52.30]I feel like I could steal this, but...
[65:56.83]How do you enter feet first?
[66:00.76]A convertible.
[66:03.01]Like a car.
[66:05.67]No.
[66:05.93]I mean, you technically do go.
[66:07.86]Would you climb through the window?
[66:11.14]let me get in the car a bicycle a bicycle oh would you do a handstand on your bicycle just pedaling like you know like you know what I mean you have to like swing your foot over the bike to get a good grab oh you swing your foot how high is that bike that you're riding I'm just a short guy like I have to really go on my tippy toes alright so this game
[66:34.78]Alright, I'm going to say jacuzzi.
[66:37.21]If pool is up there, jacuzzi is up there too.
[66:38.99]You got to be very careful.
[66:39.95]Nobody is diving into a jacuzzi.
[66:43.81]That is painful.
[66:44.83]It would hurt.
[66:46.42]Either that or I am going to take what you said and do the like.
[66:53.62]No, what are you doing?
[66:54.46]That was a suggestion.
[67:00.65]Why did it pop up like that?
[67:03.50]I thought I was just, whatever, I still beat you.
[67:10.89]Alright, well, what were the answers?
[67:15.79]Okay, so for the future.
[67:17.60]Of course you put your feet in the shoes, Jerma.
[67:23.30]Obviously feet first.
[67:25.38]Why are you telling me?
[67:26.26]Car was up there.
[67:29.19]Car was up there.
[67:29.89]No way.
[67:31.37]Car was actually up there.
[67:33.76]Jacuzzi.
[67:34.64]That's the same thing.
[67:35.72]It's just a little less, a little smaller.
[67:38.39]It's not the same.
[67:40.21]And a pool is the same thing as a jacuzzi, but just a little bigger.
[67:44.14]Alright, so if you do a suggestion, just to let you know, when it becomes your turn, it pops up on the screen.
[67:50.99]And if you press A, you're choosing the suggestion that you wrote last round.
[67:55.99]Ah, so you wrote ha ha ha ha.
[67:59.06]Yeah, I was like sending that to you.
[68:00.86]I was like sending it over to your screen.
[68:02.89]No, yeah, I didn't get the message.
[68:05.21]I also wrote, fuck you, and it didn't show up, and I might be in trouble.
[68:09.62]Yeah, you can no longer play the new Assassin's Creed games, that means.
[68:14.72]Congratulations, a lifetime ban for Ubisoft.
[68:17.75]Alright, I got to minimize chat.
[68:21.21]For this survey, we're asking for the top answer only.
[68:24.45]Points are tripled.
[68:25.88]Whoever gets this answer wins the round.
[68:27.32]You can actually take it here.
[68:29.01]I can't believe I'm losing.
[68:30.77]I forgot.
[68:32.68]Name one thing you see in every house.
[68:36.30]Oh, I was spamming.

[69:01.36]I don't know.
[69:02.34]Fuck.
[69:04.54]Wait, why is there only one answer?
[69:06.78]Because you have to get the number one.
[69:09.21]Oh.
[69:09.35]I bet you've got a great answer for us.
[69:13.73]Name one thing you see in every house.

[69:27.76]That's good.
[69:28.36]I think you got it.
[69:32.09]No.
[69:32.55]Okay.
[69:32.79]That's incorrect.
[69:35.29]It's gonna be something so stupid like walls.
[69:37.81]It is.
[69:38.11]It's gonna be like floor.

[69:50.09]No.
[69:51.69]A couch in every house.
[69:55.43]I'm going to just go with the dumb answer because it could be like, oh, a floor.
[70:01.01]Yeah, it's not a bad answer.
[70:02.64]Our survey says floor.
[70:09.20]Okay.
[70:09.32]We're not going to get this.
[70:10.43]You were going to say walls.
[70:11.73]So, I mean, is it?
[70:13.35]No, but I don't think people are that cheeky, though.
[70:15.93]I don't think so.
[70:18.54]Like kitchen?
[70:20.16]But somehow kitchen is...
[70:24.47]I said fridge and it wasn't fridge if you got a kitchen but maybe it's more general maybe it's more general like some kitchens don't have fridges maybe I don't know I don't know one thing yeah an entire kitchen is a thing oh my god I know what it is no you don't sorry a hundred percent do you know an answer I promise I'm gonna steal it from you a TV

[71:30.73]Let me just get started.
[71:31.79]Alright.

[71:43.93]Here we go.
[71:45.38]I gotta nail this.
[71:51.03]TV is more important than food?
[71:55.34]That's true.
[71:56.62]More people said TV than fridge.
[72:00.72]Here we go.
[72:04.87]Uh... Hide and seek.
[72:16.70]They're like, count.
[72:18.27]Count.
[72:19.05]What are they?
[72:23.95]I have to go with it.
[72:24.79]This is what I was going to say.
[72:40.15]Calves.
[72:41.13]It's incredibly difficult to get your calves built up.
[72:45.17]Uh, cry.
[72:47.64]Uh, nose.
[73:02.47]Name something that comes small, medium, and large.
[73:06.03]Oh, I cleaned him up.
[73:09.02]He's fucked here.
[73:10.28]He's screwed.
[73:11.02]There's no way.
[73:12.56]I cleaned him up so bad.
[73:15.31]Hey, you're totally screwed here.
[73:16.49]I just want to say good luck.
[73:21.05]Okay, I'm ready.
[73:22.44]Going second is a little more difficult.
[73:24.73]You did a good job, you're saying?
[73:26.09]Oh, I think I did.
[73:26.85]I think I got all the number ones.
[73:30.02]If you do, you'll have to give it another guess.
[73:32.40]Yeah, but you're sometimes very confident about things that are very, like, unconventional.
[73:37.33]So I still think I can do this.
[73:41.93]Sleep.
[73:43.62]Children close their eyes to sleep.
[73:45.00]Bodybuilders have muscles that ordinary people don't.
[73:50.53]Bodybuilders?
[73:51.59]Thighs.
[73:53.57]Okay.
[73:54.90]Think again.
[73:55.54]Oh, no.
[73:57.46]Calves.
[74:00.93]We already had that.
[74:01.99]What?
[74:02.89]I already said that.
[74:03.57]That's what I said already.
[74:04.55]I'm freaking out.
[74:05.89]Abs.
[74:06.35]Abs.
[74:08.76]That's actually a good answer.
[74:10.32]The new Miss America does the moment she is chosen.
[74:15.53]What is something a new Miss America does?
[74:17.99]Cheer.
[74:18.95]Oh, no.
[74:19.45]You're already wrote that one.
[74:22.71]She, she, uh, she, she cheers.
[74:28.96]She cheers.
[74:29.58]Name something kids get yelled at for sticking their fingers in.
[74:33.82]We are just completely opposite spectrums there.
[74:36.72]We're at pie.
[74:39.21]Name something that comes small, medium, and large.
[74:42.81]Oh, my God.
[74:43.17]Easy.
[74:44.31]T-shirt.
[74:46.27]You already put that one.
[74:47.31]Nope.
[74:48.50]I didn't.
[74:51.57]You better hurry up.
[74:55.79]That's true.
[74:56.71]That's true.
[74:57.51]You can have a small shit, a little shit.
[74:59.31]You can have diarrhea.
[75:00.02]There's a lot of different types.
[75:00.96]There's a whole poop chart, dude.
[75:02.34]There's like a seven thing poop chart.
[75:04.68]Right.
[75:05.84]There's a diagram.
[75:08.18]A small shit is just a I fucked up.
[75:11.73]I fucked up bad.
[75:12.63]For starters, we asked something.
[75:16.59]Children close their eyes.
[75:17.96]I think you're going to get this one.
[75:20.24]And your what did you put?
[75:21.72]I can't imagine anything else.
[75:24.94]Okay.
[75:25.06]I don't think it's.
[75:26.88]Hide and seek is good.
[75:29.16]Oh, we have a top answer.
[75:30.71]Alright.
[75:32.45]Top answer.
[75:33.71]Wait, let's fucking go.
[75:34.93]Where do bodybuilders have muscles that ordinary people don't abs?
[75:39.21]You actually might get this even with calves up here.
[75:42.84]Two impressive answers here.
[75:45.14]Wait, calves are not the same as thighs.
[75:47.40]What are in the points?
[75:49.03]You know how hard it is to get calves that stick out and look cool?
[75:52.87]I have that, so I do know.
[75:55.50]You remember the third question, right?
[75:58.58]You got those monster calves?
[76:00.06]Oh, big time.
[76:01.51]Literally big time.
[76:02.35]This is great because look at the answers here.
[76:04.71]So you said... And our survey said... Boom!
[76:12.29]Number one answer.
[76:13.95]but I accidentally looked away for some reason you looked away I literally looked away because I minimized oh so it was miss America you said cheer I said wait and cry wins over cheering oh cause crying of happiness at least one of them got some points dude don't put your finger in your nose
[76:33.00]You don't put it in a pie.
[76:34.08]It ruins the whole pie.
[76:35.83]Is this like the 40s?
[76:37.77]It's like, oh, Junior, don't put your finger in that pie.
[76:41.84]Yes, yes.
[76:42.40]You don't put it in the pie.
[76:43.32]You're going to ruin Thanksgiving.
[76:44.58]You got your grandma and aunties coming over.
[76:46.58]They're not going to have apple pie.
[76:47.83]You're telling me.
[76:49.77]It's a good answer.
[76:50.59]Dude, no shit.
[76:53.52]Okay, so it's 1-1.
[76:55.36]It is 1-1.
[76:57.28]We gotta get the tiebreaker.
[77:00.35]You won by a lot.
[77:02.39]You won by a lot the first time, too.
[77:03.87]Yeah, but not as much.
[77:06.86]Excuse me, teacher?
[77:07.76]Yes?
[77:08.24]Could I go pee?
[77:11.93]Um... Yeah.
[77:15.09]I have to go to the bathroom, too, actually.
[77:18.14]Alright, well, maybe we can just sit on this menu, and we'll be back in a few minutes.
[77:21.76]Perfect.
[77:23.16]See you in a minute.
[77:26.19]Be right back.
[77:30.60]Do you want to play again?
[80:50.50]I have returned.
[80:52.12]You are here.
[80:52.62]Hello.
[80:53.50]Yes, me too.
[80:54.42]Hello.
[80:54.94]Perfect timing.
[80:56.69]Okay, rematch.
[80:59.57]Yeah.
[80:59.69]It is time for the rematch.
[81:03.60]Highbreaker.
[81:03.90]This is it.
[81:04.40]This is for all the marbles.
[81:05.74]I'm ready.
[81:06.30]I feel like I've really warmed up.
[81:07.86]You can see the highest chain we have.
[81:11.69]Oh, fastest answer?
[81:12.73]Holy shit.
[81:14.85]How did I get fastest and slowest thinker?
[81:21.28]Wait, Jerma, is this game like eight players?
[81:24.24]Or like whatever, ten players?
[81:25.71]You can have one person per family member?
[81:29.13]Is that what it means by single and whatever?
[81:31.96]Maybe you can have a few people in each console.
[81:35.49]That would be so cool.
[81:37.63]That would be pretty cool.
[81:40.99]This is the first time I've played Family Feud against anyone, by the way.
[81:44.83]I think there's some places where you can, but actually in-game, I don't think I've played it like this before.
[81:49.76]Wait, you usually play against bots?
[81:51.32]I usually just play against, yeah, nobody.
[81:54.71]Oh, wait, cool.
[81:56.11]Yeah, I've never played this against anyone either.
[81:57.55]Yeah, I play alone.
[82:02.60]Yeah, that's okay.
[82:04.00]Me too.
[82:04.38]I play, you know the game Mario Party?
[82:07.49]Do you play that with bots?
[82:09.29]yeah no you don't I feel like I I still help me god I I play I put like hundreds of hours against really I always felt like it was kind of like night rain where you just like don't do it unless you have three other people
[82:22.08]Um, well, I've also played some Night Raid alone.
[82:27.14]Which, by the way, it is a 0.0 alone.
[82:29.45]I like Night Raid alone.
[82:33.07]I like it because you queue with people and then you have to do little signs.
[82:36.98]No, no, no.
[82:37.40]I'm talking about nobody else.
[82:39.36]Just alone, single, just you, no other players.
[82:43.73]Oh, like you can't even queue with strangers.
[82:46.01]Yeah, you can just play solo.
[82:47.27]There's a solo mode.
[82:48.64]Oh, I've never even tried that.
[82:50.24]Okay, that would be really hard.
[82:53.24]I gave it an 8.6.
[82:55.65]And then I gave solo mode a 0.0.
[82:58.75]I think that's fair.
[83:02.01]You are so quick.
[83:07.04]That's insane.
[83:10.74]That's got to be number one, right?
[83:12.02]Like, there's no way that's not.
[83:13.82]That would be insane.
[83:14.88]That'd be crazy if it wasn't.
[83:18.31]toilet okay I close the chat oh yeah that close it oh wait so you had the chat open for that one are you gonna play yeah I I I must have taken that one from China sorry uh that's okay okay when I think of flush I'm gonna play alright because uh poker is definitely up there that was the only one I had you're up and I knew that was the only one you probably had so even if I get these wrong you're in trouble
[83:46.74]Holy shit, this guy's ear in my head now.
[83:49.22]Because we played two, you can really identify the brain of your opponent.
[83:54.29]I'm scared.
[83:55.65]You read me like a book.
[83:57.05]Poker, two.
[83:57.73]Yeah, okay.
[83:59.50]So it's 81.
[84:03.54]Yeah, but good luck on these last two.
[84:08.39]I'm going to say, like, your face.
[84:10.83]Like, you look flush.
[84:12.14]Like, complexion.
[84:14.52]Oh, okay.
[84:15.64]But would people say complexion?
[84:17.54]Or would they say face?
[84:18.72]They would say face flush.
[84:22.09]Like, your face.
[84:23.53]Your face is looking flush.
[84:25.11]Yeah.
[84:26.13]Not your... Actually, I would go with complexion now that I... Only a few answers left.
[84:30.78]Have you found one?
[84:33.28]Face.
[84:35.84]Okay.
[84:36.92]Okay.
[84:37.35]You guys cleared the board.
[84:39.95]I'm just saying like this like pops into my brain just because you hear this is just like in TV shows and movies and shit.
[84:55.16]And like, okay, yeah, I'm just saying it could be up there.
[84:58.39]Okay, let's see it.
[84:59.87]Drugs?
[85:00.85]I don't know, like, oh, you flushed the drugs down the toilet, right?
[85:03.60]Like in Breaking Bad.
[85:05.20]Yes.
[85:06.54]Uh-oh, it's not there.
[85:09.98]And that means you've got yourself a strike.
[85:12.65]I have one that might be weird.
[85:16.69]There's only one answer remaining.
[85:23.30]And you have to flush down a fish.
[85:26.40]it's so easy to take care of maybe you got complacent oh that's so sad but like it could be the one but I don't know if I want to I don't know if I want to use an x on that I don't know I just think it's worth trying it actually might be if it's up there then uh I'll give you a five points for it I guess I would go under toilet though is it there
[85:53.47]When you think about it.
[85:56.07]Shit.
[85:56.56]Okay.
[85:57.62]That's your second strike right there.
[86:02.62]The royal flush.
[86:04.17]You look flush.
[86:05.43]I can't think of anything else.
[86:08.43]Flush.
[86:09.60]Um... Like a... Like a clog?
[86:13.98]Like, yeah, you gotta flush that clog out.
[86:15.98]I don't know.
[86:17.15]Pipes?
[86:18.25]That's what I mean.
[86:18.69]Like a pipe.
[86:19.35]Like a clogged pipe.
[86:20.29]I feel like that'd be toilet.
[86:21.29]That'd be toilet, no?
[86:22.75]I guess I'm just gonna say it because I don't got anything else do you have to flush your eyes let me flush a pipe okay I don't know I'm just trying to think of like what do you I don't know a pipe no okay I'm gonna put ears flush your ears oh like the doctor
[86:48.67]Yes.
[86:49.41]For like, if you have like a buildup of earwax.
[86:51.49]Oh, the doctor does like flushes out your ears with the irrigator.
[86:54.82]Oh shit.
[86:55.44]That actually might be it.
[86:58.94]But how's that above face?
[87:01.36]Your face being flush, your ears are being flushed.
[87:06.39]Like there's no way, right?
[87:07.87]It's gotta be something we're not thinking of.
[87:09.91]It could be.
[87:13.52]Flush your ear.
[87:15.40]Flush out my ears of wax.
[87:17.54]I feel like it could be.
[87:21.20]I have no clue.
[87:27.04]So what?
[87:29.04]Flush what?
[87:30.80]Sinuses.
[87:32.95]Oh.
[87:34.13]I mean, ears.
[87:35.07]You were close there if it's sinuses.
[87:36.81]Flush your sinus like a tissue?
[87:39.12]Straight.
[87:41.07]it's another it's another poker reference which family is leading the way wait that way we're getting robbed how's that not cards when I said poker it gave me royal there's still everything it didn't give me both of them you could have read you could write poker twice okay so this is just a wash round we're gonna uh this one doesn't count well I like I'd say like three of those points don't count let's get things going I agree so I have 80 points
[88:09.87]So if you lose by four points, that would be crazy.
[88:14.14]That would be insane.
[88:15.50]I guess I'm going to take this right now.
[88:18.60]No, absolutely not.
[88:22.48]This girl, Brainy, is the A player on my team.
[88:27.05]I've never lost.
[88:28.55]Me either.
[88:29.05]So that's interesting how that works.
[88:31.67]The same character.
[88:32.87]You have hit A. I just did.
[88:36.02]Thank God.
[88:38.98]Dude, how did you just fuck with me?
[88:41.55]Up your nose.
[88:43.73]You said that so competently that I just hit A. And then I didn't read the question.
[88:49.31]What did our survey say?
[88:51.13]What is the question?
[88:51.89]Pineapple.
[88:53.26]Don't you have a pineapple?
[88:54.76]What?
[88:55.81]up your nose I thought wait what you're feuding face on it's your name how is it not pineapple no you definitely couldn't put a pineapple up your nose you definitely couldn't put an apple up there either and that's probably number one well that's good I mean if we're getting literal your answer is more accurate
[89:21.83]this it's so goofy it's rigged okay I'm gonna I'm gonna play it I'm just gonna pick every fruit that's a popular fruit that some random guy in the street would say hey hey this is like hey name a fruit ah banana okay pineapple pineapple is such a good common fruit yeah dude this is great this is literally name of fruit I got this oh no this is going to be so hard to recover from how do they come up with this question
[89:50.80]uh I'm gonna say banana just what are the what are the most popular common fruits yeah but there are small bananas I don't think bananas up there no bananas definitely up there no no no way ain't nobody putting a banana up their nose yeah right what yes okay what about a watermelon
[90:13.21]Nobody's going to get a watermelon up there, just like they wouldn't get a pineapple.
[90:15.85]So why would pineapple not be up there?
[90:17.58]Are you saying watermelon is more popular than pineapple?
[90:20.44]I think so.
[90:25.57]I personally don't.
[90:26.83]I like pineapple more than watermelon, but I think watermelon is more popular than pineapple.
[90:31.49]Pineapple's just a pain to cut.
[90:33.47]And it's also huge.
[90:35.05]It's huge.
[90:36.53]Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[90:37.76]It makes a mess.
[90:39.04]You know what?
[90:40.02]I'm actually team watermelon.
[90:42.40]I buy a free cut, though.
[90:44.49]Does that make me like, nah.
[90:46.55]Are you a seedless watermelon guy?
[90:48.71]It has to be seedless.
[90:50.88]Do you have watermelon with seeds in it?
[90:53.50]Sometimes, yeah.
[90:54.88]Hold on.
[90:55.12]Wait a minute.
[90:55.78]Wait a minute.
[90:57.81]Doesn't that ruin your experience of watermelon?
[91:02.67]no wait you you sometimes but I that I mean I know it's more authentic that way this actually could be bad because you just need to write a fruit that I did not write and you might get it yeah but I can't think of a fruit I don't know like a just name every popular fruit okay then
[91:33.89]Orange is a good one.
[91:35.17]I think orange is going to be like number four or five.
[91:37.46]Almost impossible is weirdly worded here.
[91:41.06]Nice, there we go.
[91:43.63]I mean, if you put some effort and you could get an origin up there, I don't know.
[91:47.61]What else is like?
[91:55.15]Coconut coconut fruit, right?
[91:57.91]Is it coconut fruit?
[91:59.49]It's a nut.
[92:00.05]Yeah.
[92:00.33]No, it's not.
[92:01.33]No, coconut's a fruit.
[92:02.49]Is it a fruit?
[92:03.09]No, it isn't.
[92:04.07]Is a coconut a nut?
[92:05.52]Is coconut a fruit or a nut?
[92:07.30]It's both, right?
[92:09.28]I would consider coconut a fruit, but I feel like it's probably classified as a nut or something, but I would say it's passing as a fruit.
[92:19.47]Okay.
[92:23.17]Oh, no.
[92:23.63]Two more.
[92:25.04]Name a fruit that would be almost impossible to stick up your nose.
[92:29.20]It's such a hard shell.
[92:30.46]There's no way you're putting a coconut up your... I don't know why I was about to say ass.
[92:38.11]There's no way you're getting a coconut up your ass.
[92:39.77]I'm just saying.
[92:41.68]I don't know why I changed it.
[92:42.70]I feel like you could just change it to ass and all of these would work.
[92:47.14]It's true.
[92:47.80]What do I know?
[92:48.58]I don't know.
[92:49.54]Fucking mango?
[92:50.29]I don't know.
[92:56.24]I mean, it's not even that big compared to like, okay.
[93:00.13]Coconut is not, it's mangoes up there, but not coconut or pineapple, which is crazy.
[93:05.91]I'm still upset about banana.
[93:07.66]Are you sure you spelled pineapple right?
[93:11.88]Yeah.
[93:15.35]Are you sure?
[93:15.99]100%.
[93:18.27]I know how to spell pineapple.
[93:19.61]Wait, is this like an elaborate bait where you give like, you spell it wrong?
[93:24.61]and then I don't get it and then you steal it?
[93:28.59]Can you imagine?
[93:30.66]I feel like you're smart enough to do that.
[93:31.82]You think I'm capable?
[93:32.50]You think so?
[93:34.82]I think I just have like a sneaky sounding voice.
[93:38.83]There's three seconds left.
[93:42.07]I had to pick something.
[93:44.40]I couldn't spell the rest of it.
[93:47.45]I couldn't spell the rest of pineapple because I had three seconds.
[93:50.45]Okay, I did guess pineapple, and it did not work.
[93:53.25]Okay, so you didn't play me here.
[93:55.45]No, I wasn't doing a secret move.
[93:58.42]What do you think about tomato?
[93:59.86]Is that crazy?
[94:04.11]Are people kind of smart enough to be like, oh, tomatoes are fruit?
[94:11.41]I think so.
[94:12.12]I think they just say banana or apple.
[94:15.47]I mean, you've already done those.
[94:17.37]I can't think of another one that you haven't done.
[94:20.25]Well, you got a minute to think of another fruit that is not.
[94:24.06]Oh, or let me think of name a fruit.
[94:27.46]Apple, banana, pineapple, orange.
[94:29.74]You did orange.

[94:42.84]Tomato's a fruit, right?
[94:43.92]It has seeds.
[94:44.82]I feel like that's too deep for, like, I stopped you on the street and asked you this question.
[94:50.75]You're right.
[94:51.61]That's not the one.
[94:52.49]What the hell?
[94:53.51]What is it?
[94:54.88]So what is it, then?
[94:57.38]A tomato is in common?
[94:58.88]I did pear, yeah.
[94:59.96]A strawberry, people are saying.
[95:02.06]You can stick a strawberry up your nose.
[95:04.15]Come on.
[95:05.41]You definitely, yeah.
[95:08.03]100%.
[95:08.41]100%.
[95:10.74]Great.
[95:11.63]a grape is that no rape what shall we take a look at the scores isn't there like a lot of cases where like kids put grapes up their nose and it's like bad and it's like they they tell parents to really watch their kids so they get in there that was me except it wasn't a grape it was a bead which is about grape sized like a grape with a seed in it let's play another game that's marbles why isn't it I think it's the same thing right
[95:40.77]marbles are grapes they're like the same size of grapes like this right I can't see your hand but I'm I'm imagining you're it's about right you you gotta lock in here you gotta lock in the top I know I'm losing big time oh no points are doubled now now I'm getting nervous 100 people I don't have a single point name a place dogs are known to drink from
[96:08.40]I just hit it so many times.
[96:11.22]I'm spamming A. That's going to be number one.
[96:19.03]Where else?
[96:19.86]That's like a misbehaved dog.
[96:22.04]It is.
[96:24.11]my god it is number one okay toilet I'm thinking like I mean maybe like any body of water that what I'm thinking is what you just said hey don't do that no I don't do that right I'm thinking like pool right don't do that hey don't drink that but you're saying it's common for people to answer a pool to this question because a lot of yeah yeah I'm thinking of like dog the thing I think dog would drink either you say hey I'm gonna say pool
[96:56.89]um no and what did our survey say oh my god wait you're a genius I would have never pulled out I'm just thinking of corrections you know like don't drink that yeah but but how does why do you do corrections like they're known to make mistakes then you're saying dogs well you said like you said toilet right we were talking about toilet like don't drink out of the toilet don't drink out of the pool don't drink out of the
[97:24.79]Oh, because toilet was a right answer.
[97:26.55]The sink, right?
[97:27.89]I'm just going with, not that they're not known.
[97:30.45]They're not known for this, but somebody could say this.
[97:32.70]Don't drink out of the sink.
[97:35.68]There's no way sink is up there.
[97:37.66]Alright, sink is not a good one.
[97:40.46]But I'm going to say like a bowl, right?
[97:44.29]Bowl is where they should be drinking from.
[97:46.41]You wouldn't say, no, no, no, don't drink out of a bowl.
[97:48.03]Drink out of a toilet.
[97:48.67]Don't drink out of a bowl.
[97:49.35]You'd say drink out of a bowl because you've been drinking out of the toilet and you've been drinking out of the sink.
[97:53.05]Bowl is number two for sure, but what is that third one?
[97:57.92]What is that third one though?
[98:03.91]Interesting answer.
[98:04.81]I have some ideas.
[98:06.49]I'm not going to share with you.
[98:07.92]Like a river?
[98:10.06]Like a lake?
[98:12.80]Okay, damn.
[98:16.91]I'm trying to think of like, I'm thinking of, I'm seeing it in my head.
[98:19.95]I'm seeing a dog go.
[98:20.87]Yeah.
[98:23.13]Yep.
[98:25.81]What are they eating, like a Stubboy sandwich?
[98:27.41]I'm thinking, like, where are they?
[98:28.43]Where are they?
[98:28.99]That's like a lake.
[98:29.59]That's like a river.
[98:30.32]That's a... That's a... That's a lake.
[98:33.94]Um... No, no, no, no.

[98:41.41]A lake?
[98:43.15]People don't live near lakes.
[98:47.10]Shit.
[98:47.96]Okay.
[98:48.96]That's a good guess, actually.
[98:50.60]I don't know what else it would be.

[99:21.33]Bullshit.
[99:22.87]Okay, I know for sure.
[99:29.44]I'm gonna be honest, I actually read this one in the chat, but I read it like a long time ago.
[99:34.09]I didn't realize you weren't gonna get them all.
[99:36.09]So I... I fucked up.
[99:38.69]I fucked up big time.
[99:39.84]So what was it?
[99:41.52]I read it and it's so right.
[99:43.46]It's Puddle.
[99:44.83]uh yeah yeah see I went I was going too big of a body of water I should instead of like a lake a small lake is a puddle so I should get some points got it right a small lake is a puddle and a medium lake is a pool I don't know oh let's go I eat it I cheated on that one I'm sorry that's fine there's still more games
[100:07.77]Because now if I lose, it's pathetic.
[100:11.19]It's like now I got no integrity.
[100:16.06]Hey, remember those four points that I said in the beginning?
[100:20.13]Or was that last round?
[100:21.69]That was this round.
[100:24.47]Alright, well, it comes down to this now.
[100:26.23]Yeah, you made it interesting.
[100:27.64]I'm cool with that.
[100:28.96]So I'm up by two.
[100:31.42]You're up by two points right now.
[100:33.82]okay chat's closed I dropped those chats drop those chairs I'm not looking I promise it all comes down to this one
[100:48.28]The top six answers to this question are up on board.
[100:50.83]And the sudden death, too.
[100:51.71]The sudden death could be worth a lot.
[100:52.81]Oh, I forgot about that.
[100:53.97]...worth triple.
[100:55.11]So this game is still up for grabs.

[101:46.40]Yeah.
[101:46.74]Okay.

[107:11.24]Yeah, is it not?
[107:12.30]That's what I'm asking.

[107:35.24]No, it was a movie.
[107:35.87]Don't steal!
[107:36.32]No, it was a movie, original Disney movie, and then they remade it.
[107:39.67]By the way, the answer is Sneezy.
[107:41.85]No!
[107:44.03]Sneezy?
[107:44.97]Yep.
[107:46.33]I've never heard of Sneezy.
[107:49.60]Why in my brain?
[107:50.44]So the worst characteristic is that he has the flu?
[107:53.70]Yeah, he's like, oh, he's sick or something.
[107:57.23]It's not even Sneezy.
[107:59.43]I don't know why in my brain...
[108:07.49]In my mind, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves was like a 20-minute cartoon, not like a, how long is the movie?
[108:13.92]like a normal movie germans like an hour and you know an hour and a half is it like is it like a 90 minute it is isn't it what do they do uh what do you mean like uh who's the most beautiful princess in the magic mirror and um maleficent sees snow white and then she has to kill him kill her and then she's in the forest she's cleaning up with the animals and then she meets the dwarves to kill the witch or something
[108:37.83]And there's a poison apple.
[108:39.19]I only remember the apple and then, hi-ho, hi-ho.
[108:43.54]I don't remember the rest of the entire movie.
[108:45.48]They're like, we're working.
[108:46.88]She turned into a dragon, remember that?
[108:48.32]We're so while you work.
[108:49.95]We're so while you, yeah, that's like a 14-minute movie to me.
[108:53.39]It'll probably just be 14 minutes.
[108:57.90]That's the wrong movie?
[109:00.26]Oh, wait.
[109:01.08]Hey, I got to mute.
[109:03.32]Oh.

[112:17.25]It's like 10 minutes of plot and 80 minutes of cleaning.
[112:20.43]Wait, Truma, do you think the entire movie is Whistle While You Work?
[112:23.90]I think that's the only part I remember because last time I saw Snow White, I had to have been like eight.
[112:28.53]It's really good.
[112:29.87]You should watch it.
[112:31.07]I don't.
[112:31.45]That's one movie.
[112:32.12]That's a Disney movie I have not gone back to.
[112:33.92]I don't.
[112:34.38]I've seen it when I was like nine.
[112:37.44]I'm just shocked because you were so confident about the dwarves.
[112:41.11]I thought you were like a huge Snow White fan.
[112:43.53]No, I didn't.
[112:44.45]Dude, I just like, I had to like reach in.
[112:47.07]You know when you go down that crazy tunnel into your childhood and you're like, oh, that's the time that I got embarrassed.
[112:52.30]Oh, that's the time that I like, I puked in the toilet.
[112:54.59]You have to go through all these memories.
[112:56.71]I was just, I was pulling them out every like 10 to 20 seconds.
[113:01.12]I was just searching so bad in the hard drive.
[113:03.58]Oh, I see.
[113:04.22]Then it really is like Inside Out.
[113:05.86]All the little figurines in your head were going crazy to get out the Snow White.
[113:11.37]But you still don't remember it.
[113:12.67]Instead, you remember the trauma.
[113:14.04]It sounds like that's sad.
[113:15.80]I got rocked, by the way.
[113:18.94]Look at this.
[113:19.69]I got absolutely owned.
[113:21.91]Destroyed.
[113:22.55]They would have given me double winnings if I was on the show.
[113:27.15]I don't know about that.
[113:27.95]I don't think we watch the same show.
[113:30.12]Can you imagine?
[113:31.56]Harvey's like, wow, you got absolutely destroyed.
[113:34.32]The opponent gets twice as much money now because you're so awful.
[113:39.19]But every single answer I did was a top answer.
[113:42.31]That should be worth another 10 grand on the show.
[113:45.85]Yeah, but they're not just playing it by ear.
[113:48.00]They have good accountants.
[113:50.76]They're not just shuffling through wads of cash.
[113:55.18]Hey, well, that was fun.
[113:56.68]That was awesome.
[113:58.15]Congratulations.
[114:00.29]For the World Series of Family Feud, I guess I'll take it.
[114:04.80]Okay.
[114:04.92]Well, I would say we can play Family Feud maybe later, but I wouldn't say the World Series.
[114:10.33]That makes it sound pretty definitive.
[114:13.41]This was your game, so you should have won it.
[114:15.58]That's true.
[114:17.40]Alright.
[114:17.62]What are we moving to?
[114:20.50]Let's see.

[116:23.14]All righty.
[116:30.67]Endless ocean luminous, huh?
[116:34.21]With taxes, it's 55.
[116:37.50]That sounds worth it though for the endless ocean.
[116:40.94]Like that's infinite.
[116:42.66]That's so good.
[116:48.46]I'm not sharing my screen, am I?
[116:51.66]It's a business expense.
[116:52.94]I just bought the ocean, ladies and gentlemen.
[116:55.32]W. A virtual card in.
[117:00.31]And now it's downloading.
[117:04.39]This shouldn't take that long, right?
[117:08.66]Oh, no.
[117:09.36]Oh, hey, hi, Jerma's chat.
[117:13.56]Oh, I have both of you, both of the chats up.
[117:17.89]Um, okay.
[117:19.51]It's going very, very, very slow.
[117:21.79]The OG game of this slap.
[117:26.84]This one is no story, just open world swimming.
[117:29.46]So we're like going on a vacation together.
[117:31.04]Is that what's happening?
[117:35.93]We're just going to be roaming around the endless ocean, looking at dolphins and sharks.
[117:43.13]It runs at 30 FPS, by the way.
[117:45.30]First time chatter.
[117:48.07]I tell you, that means you've paid $50 to play endless ocean luminous.
[117:52.70]I got to see that guy's profile.
[117:55.13]How do you even hear about this game?
[117:59.21]How do you, I need proof.
[118:00.92]There's no way unless you're watching YouTube videos.
[118:04.54]It's so boring.
[118:07.91]Okay.
[118:08.95]We got the reviewer in the chat.
[118:12.15]That's not good.
[118:14.45]but come on any game is fun when you're you know when you're with your friend going around in the ocean like how could they ruin this I have a feeling it's going to be like one of those um masterpieces it squeaks it's endless in all caps okay okay Jesus what is this like some rival company is in the chat why would you get so
[118:41.25]You've been entertaining them.
[118:44.15]I didn't realize I didn't meet you on my stream.
[118:46.01]This chat or Jerma's, we're all one and we're all human beings.
[118:50.02]That's true.
[118:50.60]Heart.
[118:52.40]Let's not divide.
[118:53.58]We are all one.
[119:00.25]I got my shit open.
[119:03.21]And happy birthday to whoever added me and said it's my birthday.
[119:07.23]In both chats.
[119:08.65]Literally two people
[119:10.59]It's two people's birthday today?
[119:11.72]Two people said it's their birthday at the same time.
[119:14.32]Do you want to do a cool experiment?
[119:15.78]I don't believe it.
[119:18.59]Here's a thing you can do in your chat.
[119:19.45]I need you to lose?
[119:20.45]Why is there a bet going on?
[119:22.51]Can you lose an endless ocean?
[119:25.36]This is multiplayer, right?
[119:26.04]How do you guys know so much about this?
[119:27.18]I feel like you're lying.
[119:29.16]I didn't just have you spend $50 for no reason, right?
[119:33.00]there's no way everyone is speaking about endless ocean so confidently uh this is multiplayer right I I didn't just I didn't just have you spend 50 bucks for no reason did I I it said it was right uh let me check
[119:53.51]Thank you for your hard work on behalf of the ocean.
[119:56.83]Yeah, it's multicolored.
[119:58.17]Luminous.
[119:58.53]Okay, it's downloading.
[120:00.74]It's taking some time to download, Jeremiah.
[120:03.86]Okay, well, there's a tutorial.
[120:05.68]I am ultimately downloading the old endless ocean.
[120:08.06]You can take pictures and stuff?
[120:11.09]Wait, that's sweet.
[120:13.11]Oh, it does emotes too.
[120:16.98]Wait, you're in it right now?
[120:17.96]I gotta see those.
[120:20.68]Yeah, you gotta do a tutorial.
[120:21.92]People were bashing.
[120:23.04]Oh, it's a required tutorial.
[120:26.58]Oh.
[120:27.84]Can we like, is it fighting?
[120:31.59]No, I heard there's no goal.
[120:37.01]You just hang out in the ocean, watch some fish.
[120:40.96]We're going to find a great white shark or something, right?
[120:44.62]That's what I'm saying.
[120:48.58]Oh, okay.
[120:48.99]You scan the fishes.
[120:56.32]You should have let me do the tutorial before we decided on this one.
[121:03.01]Well, now we have to play it, obviously.
[121:04.97]It would be a huge waste.
[121:06.41]It would be a huge waste.
[121:08.25]It would be a massive waste.
[121:10.64]Okay.
[121:12.34]We can scan creatures.
[121:14.16]This is going to be like a fun little relaxing game.
[121:18.45]Why not?
[121:19.47]Yeah.
[121:20.07]After that heated family feud.
[121:23.06]know I feel like we were you know at each other's throats and now we can just be cooperative yeah we can just take some nice pictures together yeah okay here we can do a competition let's spice this up okay best picture whoever takes the best yeah you got it best picture or picture and um how are we going to decide who the best picture taker is um
[121:47.14]don't know because my chat will probably just vote for yours okay I was gonna say my chest gonna vote for yours okay so I I guess we'll combine the we'll combine the totals yeah yeah yeah no chat chats can be objective okay right I think so alright that was a whole chapter apparently that I just completed whoa wait you're you're learning the movement and stuff before me
[122:12.71]I could have checked out the camera, but we got to get the same game.
[122:15.03]We could just dump us, just drop us into the ocean and let us do whatever we want.
[122:18.88]But I'm sorry.
[122:20.52]Oh, so wait, so you're cheating.
[122:25.00]You're checking out all the tools.
[122:26.59]Okay, here we go.
[122:28.27]A new chapter.
[122:28.89]A chance to meet... Dude, look at that thing.
[122:30.47]We can fight that.
[122:33.29]What is that?
[122:34.54]Okay.
[122:35.62]Special dive area.
[122:36.36]That's a really scary shark.
[122:37.82]There's no way that's real.
[122:40.64]Maybe I don't want to take pictures of this.
[122:42.08]Okay, shared dives.
[122:44.70]Yeah.
[122:45.14]Okay, wait, hold on.
[122:45.72]Let me check my game.
[122:47.37]Wait, customize.
[122:48.09]No, not even close.
[122:49.45]I think it's going to take a really long time.
[122:51.85]Should we just move on to something else while it downloads?
[122:54.67]We might have to move on to something else.
[122:57.56]If we play a Switch game, does it pause the download?
[123:02.04]It actually might.
[123:03.21]It's whatever.
[123:03.99]I did the first chapter.
[123:05.97]That was cool.
[123:06.47]That was worth checking out.
[123:08.73]Yeah, it was worth it.
[123:10.45]The little swimming around you did.
[123:12.12]Oh, you can customize your guide.
[123:14.74]There's skins.
[123:15.40]Yeah.
[123:16.04]This might be the best game of all time.
[123:17.60]You can be any of the Teletubbies.
[123:19.17]All of them are in the game.
[123:20.41]Holy shit.
[123:21.89]Name them.
[123:22.61]Is this going to be another situation where you didn't realize?
[123:25.07]Okay, honestly, don't look at your chat.
[123:26.52]Do not look at your chat.
[123:27.78]Close it.
[123:28.92]Okay, closed.
[123:31.06]I'm going to think we both have... We have to write them down in our chats.
[123:35.92]Okay, don't hit enter, though.
[123:37.87]Okay, but we have to write them down, but I can't look at the writing?
[123:40.95]No, no, like, I don't say it out loud, and don't look at your chat, but, like, just write it, because I don't want to, like, talk out loud.
[123:47.04]Sure, sure, I'll put it in Notepad.
[123:48.80]Okay, I'm going to... And how many are there?
[123:52.83]I have no clue.
[123:54.23]Okay, I know this one.
[123:57.49]There is...

[124:06.44]I think I got them all.
[124:08.23]What?
[124:08.53]Did you honestly?
[124:09.25]I don't know.
[124:09.79]I'm trying to think.
[124:10.27]I think so.
[124:11.31]I think so.
[124:13.41]I got four.
[124:16.83]I've got three.
[124:17.49]Okay.
[124:21.68]Ready?
[124:21.98]I'm ready to share.
[124:22.98]What was the purple one's name?
[124:26.14]I don't know, but I know the song, the theme song.
[124:29.75]It's like... You know the theme?
[124:33.04]They go through all of them.
[124:37.52]I don't know.
[124:38.36]I'm hitting enter.
[124:39.32]I'm hitting enter.
[124:40.87]Okay.
[124:41.07]I'm pasting this in the chat.
[124:44.51]It's something like that, right?
[124:45.85]Okay.
[124:46.07]Hold on.
[124:46.70]I got cut off.
[124:47.62]What were yours?
[124:49.24]Oh, wait.
[124:49.60]So Twinkie Winkie, Lala, Poe, and then Dipsy.
[124:55.23]Oh, shit.
[124:56.77]What was mine?
[124:57.43]Mine were Tinky Winky, La La, Boo Boo, and Pee Wee Wee Wee.
[125:04.38]Pee Wee Wee Wee?
[125:06.39]How did you come up with Pee Wee Wee Wee?
[125:11.07]Wait, I wrote Twinky Winky?
[125:13.52]No, I... Oh, wait.
[125:14.76]I wrote Twinky Winky.
[125:16.08]Oh, shit.
[125:17.48]Wait, what is it?
[125:18.38]It's Tinky Winky, right?
[125:20.73]Oh, yeah.
[125:21.05]Tinky Winky.
[125:21.97]I'm sorry.
[125:22.38]And what was Lala, Tinky Winky, Poe?
[125:26.95]Tinky Winky, Lala, Poe, and Dipsy.
[125:29.69]Boo, Poe, Boo Boo, Poe.
[125:34.80]Okay.
[125:35.28]Those are separate words, Jeremiah.
[125:36.70]You're saying.
[125:37.50]And then what was the last one?
[125:38.50]You thought Poe was Boo Boo?
[125:39.53]Yeah.
[125:39.79]Dipsy.
[125:40.49]Dipsy.
[125:41.51]Pee Wee, Wee Wee.
[125:42.99]No.
[125:43.59]I thought it was like Wee Wee or something.
[125:46.43]Wee-wee, not Nipsey.
[125:48.31]And the baby is a son.
[125:50.28]The baby is a son.
[125:51.62]That's what I remember.
[125:53.43]That's all I remember.
[125:55.27]Pee-wee-wee-wee is what you wrote, right?
[125:58.20]I was just taking... I was doing like two guesses in one.
[126:01.30]I thought I got the P from Poe over in pee-wee-wee-wee.
[126:05.31]Ah, okay.
[126:05.79]Pee...
[126:07.02]then I got the e the dips e in wee wee so I got I got something so you're combining them so you just like you made a freak of a teletubby yeah I got parts of the other one I got the parts right I got the parts right yeah but you just stitch it together wrong that's fine we'll just count that as a family feud win how about that okay yeah that works yeah yeah two two uh somebody said I need to switch back off from decaf um sorry I don't know all the teletubbies names
[126:36.08]Yeah, I feel like caffeinated Jerma would get that instantly.
[126:39.18]That'd be a... I kind of agree.
[126:43.04]I feel like you should know all the time.
[126:44.82]I feel like you seem like someone who would.
[126:46.73]I think if you are over the age of 35 and you get two of them right, you're fine.
[126:53.47]Um, that's true.
[126:54.57]What other shows did you watch when you were a kid?
[126:58.10]Uh, okay.
[127:00.18]I was a huge Barney the Dinosaur.

[128:34.54]From what I saw, I was actually impressed.
[128:37.80]Would you say it's underrated?
[128:41.49]I would say it is very underrated.
[128:43.73]Better than 2 out of 10.
[128:46.45]I also accidentally pressed the wrong thing.
[128:48.56]I was putting my thing down and I picked a different game.
[128:53.04]Hold on, let me back out of this.
[128:56.57]Have you played Mario Golf?
[128:58.75]No.
[129:00.77]Okay, I played it once when it came out.
[129:05.18]we're on the same foot here I'm guessing you need joy cons that's I that's I leaked I leaked so bad that was a massive leak man uh I leaked I leaked Mario um uh SpongeBob uh racers three whatever the hell it was called oh nickelodeon racers I leaked it that's my bad no one's perfect I guess
[129:29.42]Wasn't Nickelodeon Racers like a game on the PC like a long time ago?
[129:33.50]I didn't know they made a trilogy.
[129:37.87]Dude, they've made like two or three Smash Brothers games.
[129:41.01]They've made like five Mario Karts.
[129:43.09]I didn't know this either.
[129:44.30]I thought there was only one or two of these.
[129:46.48]Right, but you can't equate Smash Brothers to Nickelodeon Racers, right?
[129:51.62]That is totally its own thing.
[129:53.67]Yeah, but they've got Nickelodeon All-Star Brawlers, like one, two, three.
[129:57.61]That's a Smash Brothers game.
[130:00.33]Oh, they've got like a fighting one.
[130:02.09]Oh, I see what you mean.
[130:04.20]Yeah, true.
[130:04.58]They keep making sequels.
[130:06.18]Alright.
[130:06.44]So did I play this in Rage Quiddit and say, like, I hate Nintendo or something?
[130:09.88]I think I did that.
[130:10.50]No, that was Mario and Sonic at the Olympics.
[130:14.23]No, I've done this a few different times.
[130:16.65]Oh, I see.
[130:17.91]Wait, are you playing Switch Sundays with someone else?
[130:20.93]Yeah, myself.
[130:22.43]I play with myself.
[130:25.24]So like a family feud situation?
[130:29.86]Wait, did I play this on stream and say, like, fuck this game?
[130:33.33]Why do I have a weird memory of doing this?
[130:38.08]No, that was Sonic, I'm telling you.
[130:39.70]It looked very similar.
[130:40.70]I must have done it in my own time.
[130:43.78]I must have played this game in my own time and said, fuck this game.
[130:47.25]Alone?
[130:47.79]Yeah.
[130:48.83]And you said to nobody, fuck this.
[130:52.24]I do that, man.
[130:54.30]Yeah, you do it like your own eternal dialog.
[130:56.61]Alright, so we do play golf?
[130:59.62]Play golf, I'm guessing.
[131:01.28]Golf adventure?
[131:02.06]Which one of these should we do, Chet?
[131:03.41]Oh, network play.
[131:05.45]Go play golf and hit network play.
[131:07.20]I'm just going to hide my screen just in case.
[131:09.42]So SpongeBob doesn't show up or whatever.
[131:11.49]In case there's a room code.
[131:15.19]we don't we don't want everyone in the chats who are opening Mario golf at this time to play oh let's do motion controls isn't that fun no fine I'm doing it on a couch what you can do it on a couch I mean it's something real motion like you don't have to stand up I ain't getting up for this I ain't getting up to do this
[131:35.68]I'm not kidding you, but during the last one, I was so tired after the stream and my arms were sore.
[131:41.94]I've never felt more out of shape from Mario and Sonic at the Olympics.
[131:46.37]Pathetic.
[131:48.35]So pathetic.
[131:49.21]Alright, so we do two players, right?
[131:52.65]I don't know.
[131:53.29]One per con.
[131:53.89]Okay.
[131:54.65]So now I can create a room or find a room.
[131:56.33]Do you want to make it or want me to make it?
[131:58.26]I'll make it.
[131:59.64]Okay.
[132:00.66]Create a room.
[132:01.42]I'll put a password.
[132:02.56]Oh, I can enter room ID.
[132:05.98]Do you want it to be standard golf, speed golf, battle golf, or target golf?
[132:10.31]Standard, right?
[132:10.95]I think we start with whatever the standard is and we move from there.
[132:14.43]Agreed.
[132:14.77]Okay, good.
[132:19.18]I made a room.
[132:21.02]Okay, looking for friend rooms.
[132:23.50]Oh, I'll make the name.
[132:27.93]I don't see a room.
[132:28.85]I have to make a password.
[132:34.29]Yeah, there's an ID I can put in.
[132:39.50]It's funny that you stream from a couch sometimes.
[132:43.14]That's so much more comfortable, honestly, right?
[132:44.89]It is sick.
[132:45.63]I'm telling you, it's the new meta.
[132:48.51]Yeah.
[132:50.05]Get yourself like a recliner and set all your stuff up with a monitor and with a TV.
[132:58.07]And just, dude, it is awesome.
[133:00.79]Yeah, but I feel like if I go on a couch like that, I'll fall asleep.
[133:05.72]True.
[133:07.64]Like, I don't know.
[133:08.20]Like every time I sit with a recliner, I'm in bed.
[133:11.17]Like I just will be out for a few hours.
[133:14.39]I just had to restart my switch because you invited me to the game.
[133:19.26]It crashed.
[133:20.50]Oh, hold on.
[133:20.89]Here we go.
[133:21.71]I think it's floating.
[133:26.70]Hey, there we go.
[133:27.24]Alright.
[133:27.48]There's no, okay.
[133:28.30]There is a room ID in the corner.
[133:31.17]Yeah, but I added a password, so it should be fine.
[133:34.27]Oh, okay.
[133:35.39]Why did someone say these guys are so old?
[133:38.42]Is it because we're saying we fall asleep in a recliner?
[133:40.54]How old are you?
[133:43.73]How old am I?
[133:44.45]How old are you?
[133:46.21]Is that a dumb question to ask?
[133:48.23]No, no, you can ask.
[133:49.49]You have to guess.
[133:53.42]I think you are like 34.
[133:54.18]33.
[133:54.30]33.
[134:00.38]I am... I'm 32.
[134:05.85]Okay.
[134:06.59]That was close.
[134:09.39]That's actually a huge compliment.
[134:10.80]I'm at the point where 33 sounds good.
[134:13.98]I was going to say like 30, but I feel like I knew that you were older than 30.
[134:21.77]I don't want to be Waluigi.
[134:24.82]I didn't get to choose.
[134:26.84]Um, what course?
[134:28.04]Let's do New Donk City from Mario Odyssey.
[134:32.34]Yeah.
[134:32.46]Uh, how many holes?
[134:33.43]Definitely not nine.
[134:34.65]Let's do three.
[134:36.11]Okay.
[134:37.39]Course layout amateur?
[134:40.01]Yeah.
[134:40.51]We don't know what we're doing.
[134:41.55]I played this game for like ten minutes and swore at it and then turned up.
[134:44.48]I feel like this game has got to be for kids.
[134:45.86]Like, we could do this.
[134:47.18]Okay, so you set your shot.
[134:49.38]You, there's a top view, so you kind of go...
[134:54.06]Yes.
[134:54.58]Oh, and it's buttons.
[134:55.86]Oh, incredible.
[135:00.55]Isn't three holes like nothing?
[135:03.05]Yeah, but we're just testing it.
[135:06.01]True.
[135:08.18]Okay, seven mile per hour.
[135:10.52]Isn't this the game where you have to run around?
[135:12.32]Don't you run after each other?
[135:13.44]That's in speed mode, but they also have traditional.
[135:16.99]Oh, I go first.
[135:18.27]Okay.
[135:22.34]I think I messed up.
[135:25.19]If I mess up, you mean get like a hole in one.
[135:30.44]The wind.
[135:31.54]It's at her feet.
[135:34.00]They're blocking me with this clapping.
[135:36.13]Look at them.
[135:37.13]This is an evil clap.
[135:39.33]They're not happy.
[135:40.21]Nice shot.
[135:48.99]You've never played this before, you're saying?
[135:50.63]Never.
[135:52.77]Okay.
[135:54.55]How is it still off the green?
[135:58.24]I thought yours was perfect.
[135:59.54]Yours looked like it was going in.
[136:03.43]Oh, I see.
[136:03.97]The wind is top left.
[136:08.47]Oh, that was terrible.
[136:09.80]Oh, shit.
[136:12.16]Actually, it was great.
[136:14.88]Wait, that was perfect.
[136:21.79]Oh.
[136:24.19]Oh, that would have been a niggadoodle bite.
[136:28.81]Yeah, that was sick.
[136:34.08]It's your turn.
[136:34.54]Oh, it's my turn.
[136:36.00]Yeah.
[136:42.31]Nice.
[136:42.89]Way to par.
[136:44.23]That's right.
[136:48.22]Oh.
[136:49.24]I'm fine.
[136:49.60]I'm fine.
[136:50.96]Alright.
[136:51.52]We're both at par.
[136:52.38]How do you...
[136:54.26]How do you use the special shot?
[136:56.32]Do you see the fire under our characters?
[136:58.75]I'm afraid to use it because I feel like it's going to go soaring over all the buildings.
[137:02.89]And we'll give you a cutscene.
[137:05.72]I'm going to try using... Oh, elf.
[137:08.78]Special shot.
[137:11.15]I don't know what this does.
[137:12.07]Oh, this ain't even golf anymore.
[137:20.14]Okay.
[137:21.21]All that for that.
[137:22.13]I mean, that's just embarrassing.
[137:23.49]Alright.
[137:23.71]What about mine?
[137:25.35]Okay.
[137:34.36]Oh, you hit my ball away.
[137:38.52]Did you see that?
[137:39.24]Is that what I did?
[137:39.92]That's what the special does.
[137:43.31]Oh, my God.
[137:44.19]Wait, that's kind of toxic.
[137:47.55]You could be so mean.
[137:52.90]Can you imagine?
[137:54.86]It's like we're playing Worms.
[137:57.56]Oh, that was perfect.
[137:58.90]Worms is sick.
[138:00.99]Next time, we'll do Worms Wednesday.
[138:02.45]Uh-oh.
[138:08.81]Now I feel like a fool.
[138:16.16]Okay, here we go.
[138:17.86]Yeah!
[138:20.83]Yeah, I don't know.
[138:21.43]I feel like there's something wrong with my... I got a sneeze coming and I can't... I'm trying to... Downhill?
[138:33.57]Sink it.
[138:34.37]Oh, fuck.
[138:37.98]You just have a button to tap.
[138:39.02]I have a button to tap it at.
[138:43.95]Did you watch the British Open?
[138:46.68]Dude, if you had told me, hey, Dermo, retroactively, if you had watched the British Open for even one second, and I mean even accidentally, I would deposit $100 million into your checking account.
[139:07.59]I wouldn't be able to claim that money.
[139:10.38]What?
[139:11.33]Wait, are you upset at me?
[139:12.41]Are you happy?
[139:13.12]I'm so confused.
[139:14.00]I'm just saying, I haven't even watched it for one second.
[139:19.10]Oh, okay.
[139:20.20]I guess so, no is the answer.
[139:21.62]And we're talking about even when this shit pops up on the TV, remember back when you actually had to surf the channels, remember that?
[139:27.71]Uh, yeah, oh yeah, I remember.
[139:29.15]Yeah, I don't know what the fuck that's like.
[139:31.33]Back when you used to actually channel surf, I'm even talking about that.
[139:35.92]I'm talking about going... Oh.
[139:38.28]Mm-hmm.
[139:39.82]What do you mean?
[139:40.20]Like, you're going, like, to go out of your way to find golf?
[139:43.60]So you're saying if you accidented upon the British Open, you would close it with disgust?
[139:47.79]No, no, no.
[139:49.75]I'm saying that even back then, when we're talking, like, all about traffic on the... And we're here at the British Open.
[139:58.94]Nope.
[139:59.74]I wouldn't even be able to be on it for that long.
[140:02.78]That was it.
[140:03.15]You could even hear his British Open.
[140:06.07]Yeah, you'd hear, like, the O in British Open, and I would be gone.
[140:09.37]Nice shot.
[140:10.11]Okay, so you hate it.
[140:12.05]I don't hate it.
[140:12.65]I just have absolutely no interest.
[140:13.89]No, you're upset by it.
[140:15.20]No, I have zero interest.
[140:16.82]No interest, you wouldn't even mention it.
[140:18.82]You clearly have something, some sort of grief with the British Open.
[140:23.24]Okay.
[140:23.36]Okay, what if it's like an American Open?
[140:24.67]Is that better?
[140:25.37]Okay.
[140:26.61]Let's go into it.
[140:28.51]I went to golf camp when I was like 13.
[140:31.21]Oh, okay.
[140:33.06]Golf was great.
[140:34.96]My whole family plays golf.
[140:36.52]My brother's a big golfer.
[140:38.42]My father was a big golfer.
[140:41.35]every time I would try alright time to get up there here we go slice the ball into the woods every time every single time and and that I would I would hear about oh I want you hey hey uh like brother what what did you get on your uh oh yeah you got you got one of a par oh excellent and I'm the guy like scooping the ball up out of the out of the the moss in the side of the river
[141:08.41]That's so sad.
[141:09.21]I'm actually so grateful you agreed to play this game.
[141:11.80]I mean, I would never play golf again.
[141:13.66]I'm getting Hearthstone roped.
[141:15.80]What?
[141:16.18]Oh, hold on.
[141:19.85]I would just... I mean, that's so... No wonder you don't want to use your special, Jirba.
[141:23.97]It's going to be like that again.
[141:27.22]So you're from a family of golfers, but you didn't... You just didn't take to the sport.
[141:30.56]Dude, did you beat me by one stroke?
[141:32.58]You beat me.
[141:33.71]In golf...
[141:34.97]Less points is... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[141:37.62]You're bringing back bad memories.
[141:39.52]No, I know.
[141:39.92]I'm sorry.
[141:40.32]I hate to explain it to you because I know it transports you.
[141:43.29]Like you said in the last game, you have to go through the file folder of your childhood every time someone brings it up.
[141:48.72]So, I'm sorry.
[141:50.64]Do you want to do a different course?
[141:53.78]Yeah, a new course.
[141:54.89]This is cute.
[141:55.71]This is fun.
[141:56.95]I like this a lot.
[141:58.85]Let me ask you a question to somebody that's over the age of 30.
[142:01.79]I think.
[142:02.44]I don't know.
[142:02.80]I am.
[142:05.20]As I approach 40, remember, I'm going to be 40 this year.
[142:09.89]Do you have the same problem?
[142:11.65]Thank you.
[142:12.21]I'm looking forward to it.
[142:13.47]I don't give a shit.
[142:15.24]It's great.
[142:15.70]I'm all for it.
[142:18.28]um but what I've noticed is and I've said this on stream before and people were like question marks and then some people said true and those people get it um my brain hard drive has started it filled up at 37 38 or so and stuff is getting the you know you know you're like you when you have too much stuff on your drive alright just erase over the oldest the oldest stuff
[142:43.76]Clean out the drive a little.
[142:46.09]My brain has like 35 years of space and it is just moving forward and all the other stuff back there is just getting written over.
[142:56.41]Yeah.
[142:56.77]I mean, I feel like I've had that in my twenties.
[142:59.44]So all of like the old knowledge, but like, so then I guess you have to be careful of what you stored and what you got rid of.
[143:04.93]Yeah.
[143:05.05]Like what, what are you overriding?
[143:06.83]I wonder.
[143:07.57]Yeah.
[143:08.39]Like Team Fortress 2.
[143:09.63]Think about how much stuff that you've overwritten, like how much data in your, you know, SSD.
[143:14.34]And I, and I've been told.
[143:15.32]That's so sad.
[143:16.11]Only one person said this, by the way, and I was incredibly upset with them over it, but they did have a take.
[143:22.74]They said that I have a single core CPU.
[143:28.26]And they said, but it's like five gigahertz.
[143:30.53]I have a five gigahertz single core CPU up there.
[143:33.89]They're insulting you, Jeremiah.
[143:37.08]That's not a nice analogy.
[143:37.90]It was an absolute insult.
[143:39.66]This person was saying this as a complete and total insult.
[143:43.32]Yeah.
[143:43.91]No, I wouldn't take that.
[143:45.09]You don't think I should take that?
[143:46.53]No, I don't think so.
[143:47.61]I'd be pissed.
[143:49.82]I think you should talk back and say you at least have an i9.
[143:55.56]Okay.
[143:55.68]My brain is not underclocked or whatever.
[143:57.82]I don't know computer things.
[143:59.63]But you still think I have a single core CPU?
[144:03.85]I think most people do.
[144:10.33]hold on a second here you wanted me to stand up you wanted me to stand up to this bully that gave me that and yeah and but you're saying but hold on a second maybe it's an i9 no no an i9 is good I'm just saying there's a charm to a single core like ever play like pong or like on the commodore or early ataris you're I think what you're implying is single core is like useless and bad and I'm kind of pushing back on that oh okay alright so it's good like I'm probably a single I'd probably be a double
[144:40.55]I think you're a dual core at least.
[144:43.17]Wait, thanks.
[144:44.11]I needed to hear that more than you know.
[144:45.99]No, I think you generally at least like a quad core.
[144:50.12]You're kidding.
[144:50.92]Now I feel bad for calling you a single core.
[144:53.26]Overclocked?
[144:54.84]No, absolutely not.
[144:56.31]No, okay.
[144:56.83]That's a little too far.
[144:58.03]I think I have a like six gigahertz single core processor that is underclocked.
[145:04.12]Like a hamster on a wheel running a computer, is that what you're saying?
[145:07.51]I run this at probably like 3 gigahertz, but I could probably run it at like 7.
[145:11.91]But I just like, I don't really, I don't want to go into the BIOS.
[145:14.80]Yeah, but what's off if it's only at 3?
[145:15.74]Like, is it like, you're saying it's maybe a decision or something?
[145:19.36]I'm too lazy to go into the BIOS and just change the setting, honestly.
[145:22.96]Yeah, that's how I feel.
[145:23.69]That's like my monitor was at 144 hertz, but I run it at 60 hertz for years.
[145:28.61]I just never realized.
[145:30.35]That's sort of the same situation.
[145:32.28]That is kind of true.
[145:33.14]That's kind of close.
[145:34.58]yeah it doesn't make a difference um okay you are not bad at this I'm terrible I think we can put oh wait actually god damn and quad core cpu over here oh playing up the single core
[145:54.26]Yeah, I'm also afraid if I do end up doing... See, this is the single core problem here.
[146:00.03]I was just trying to talk to you and play, and all five gigahertz were going into talking to you.
[146:07.42]The automatic, that is the problem.
[146:10.12]I can't do the dual core.
[146:13.40]Okay, you know what?
[146:14.44]I think maybe I'm a single core too.
[146:17.55]I can't do that either.
[146:19.05]Somebody just called you a Celeron.
[146:20.45]Should I ban him?
[146:22.54]Yeah, 100%.
[146:25.20]That's bannable.
[146:25.98]Yeah, that's bannable.
[146:27.93]That's bannable.
[146:28.85]That's at least purgeable.
[146:29.91]That's rude because that's like a smart insult because the guy knows what a Celeron is.
[146:34.24]So it hurts even more.
[146:36.82]Yeah, that hurts even more.
[146:38.54]That's very distinct and very descriptive.
[146:41.62]I'm sorry.
[146:41.90]I thought there was rules in the chat.
[146:44.13]Mods, make sure you're on your A game today.
[146:48.45]Wait, what?
[146:50.00]There's only nine miles per hour.
[146:51.94]A little too hard.
[146:52.86]I didn't factor in the wind.
[146:54.12]You see there's a sideways tornado as well.
[146:58.85]Well, time to make your day miserable.
[147:01.99]Okay.
[147:02.27]Let's see what you got.
[147:03.26]I still have my special.
[147:08.02]Oh.
[147:09.35]Get in there.
[147:11.25]Wait.
[147:11.47]I have something really mean I could do.
[147:17.44]Wait.
[147:17.64]How do I change from a butter?
[147:20.56]How do I change?
[147:21.72]I think it's up the buttons, little buttons.
[147:26.02]I think I got it.
[147:26.82]We would both be Celerons because of our age.
[147:31.81]You know, how about this?
[147:32.79]I am not a CPU at all.
[147:34.35]I am a refrigerator that was made in 1952.
[147:36.96]Like not a smart fridge, not one with a TV on it.
[147:42.80]Guess what?
[147:43.30]Those things were made like tanks.
[147:45.69]They were reliable.
[147:47.33]They still probably run to this day.
[147:50.21]True.
[147:51.19]They... Oh, wow, you got a fridge and it fails in three years.
[147:54.69]Oh, that car fucked up in three years.
[147:57.25]Oh, wait, did you get a washing machine?
[147:58.79]Oh, did you get a dishwasher?
[147:59.86]It doesn't work anymore after like 19 months.
[148:03.66]No.
[148:04.54]I am a fridge from the 1950s.
[148:05.82]It might not be as powerful, but I am reliable and I can fucking freeze all your food quick.
[148:11.27]Yeah, you probably poison the food as well because it's painted with lead or something, so maybe it's not all that good.
[148:18.37]Just to, you know...
[148:19.65]Wait, someone called you an abacus in my chat.
[148:22.04]What should I do with them?
[148:25.00]I would be very upset if I knew what that was.
[148:27.22]An abacus?
[148:29.97]What is that?
[148:31.49]It's like one of those... Wait, you don't know what an abacus is?
[148:33.33]That's fine.
[148:33.73]I mean, it's a... It's like how you do calculations.
[148:37.92]And it's like beads on string.
[148:42.69]Oh, it's with the thing.
[148:45.01]Yeah, exactly.
[148:45.99]Like the thing that was in every doctor's office, the little toy, the ball that you go around the thing with.
[148:52.99]They need to bring those back.
[148:53.95]They got to bring those back.
[148:54.79]I do not remember that from a doctor's office.
[148:56.85]Did your doctor's office have games?
[148:58.94]Yeah, dude, this was, it was sick.
[149:00.38]Are you sure it was a doctor?
[149:01.92]Yeah, dude, it was, it was like in the...
[149:04.44]In the waiting room of the doctor that I went to, they had little... It was like a pediatrician.
[149:09.09]It was a pediatric doctor.
[149:09.86]Ah, you're right.
[149:10.74]You're right.
[149:11.52]No, you're actually... You know, doctor offices used to have Nintendo 64s and stuff.
[149:16.39]What?
[149:16.75]I didn't have that.
[149:17.45]I had the, there was a, it was a, they should bring these back.
[149:20.89]It was a huge, elaborate, silly string, silly straw looking thing.
[149:25.50]It was a mess.
[149:26.86]So many wires everywhere.
[149:28.31]And there were balls that were, it was colored balls.
[149:30.93]It's like, here's the green wire.
[149:32.77]Here's the blue one.
[149:33.91]And it would be a massive design around.
[149:36.80]And each one had a hole carved in the middle of a ball.
[149:40.06]You're right.
[149:41.21]Yeah.
[149:41.71]And you have to follow it down.
[149:43.31]You followed it all around and down and around.
[149:45.90]It was a stimulating experience for a young child.
[149:48.98]Oh, my God.
[149:49.45]You're right.
[149:49.95]I completely forgot of those existing.
[149:52.07]And why did they get rid of them?
[149:53.54]What a great developmental tool for a young child.
[149:57.06]Yeah, but now we're like old men screaming at clouds.
[149:59.46]Now we're like, the fucking iPad.
[150:02.34]God damn it, everyone.
[150:03.56]Everyone's not engaging with things that we appreciate, like colored balls on string.
[150:09.43]Your hard drive should wipe that.
[150:11.43]We're going Celeron.
[150:13.23]Yeah, go back to the Celeron.
[150:14.74]No, I don't want to wipe that from my hard drive.
[150:16.98]Those things are cool.
[150:18.26]I want to remember those.
[150:19.14]Keep it.
[150:20.36]I'm dragging that out of a folder.
[150:22.87]I'm putting it into childhood memories.
[150:25.40]I dropped it in.
[150:27.06]Okay.
[150:27.63]I'm backing it up.
[150:28.37]I'm naming that one childhoodmemories.old.
[150:31.48]And this new one is childhood memories, it has it in there, and I'm sealing it.
[150:34.93]And it's safe.
[150:35.37]Yes, and delete abacus, it was unnecessary.
[150:37.37]You don't need to know what an abacus is.
[150:38.27]Dragging abacus, I'm going into useless, fucking useless info, the folder.
[150:42.18]There's like a ton of folders here.
[150:43.82]Going to that folder.
[150:44.50]And one's called fucking useless, not just useless.
[150:46.95]And this abacus, yeah, there it is.
[150:50.01]It's a .txt file, dude.
[150:52.74]Holy shit.
[150:53.62]Yep, into the recycling bin.
[150:56.18]Yes, I confirm, I am sure.
[150:59.04]And you're emptying the recycling bin?
[151:00.50]It's still not in your recesses of memory?
[151:02.70]Ow.
[151:02.96]Holy shit.
[151:06.29]Are you- Oh my god, that must have hurt.
[151:08.15]What, um... Are you okay?
[151:10.53]Yeah, we, uh... What were we just talking about?
[151:13.57]What was the last thing we were just talking about?
[151:16.82]Abacus.
[151:16.98]You have to delete it again.
[151:19.68]Uh, like abracadabra?
[151:21.12]That's like a magician thing.
[151:22.00]That's cool.
[151:23.59]Yeah, okay.
[151:29.02]Nice shot!
[151:29.59]What are the coins?
[151:30.51]What do they do?
[151:31.23]Okay, can I say something?
[151:32.59]I hate being like excuse Earl.
[151:36.39]Okay.
[151:36.89]Going first is a huge disadvantage here, right?
[151:40.26]I guess maybe?
[151:41.28]Because you can see where the ball lands and you can copy it.
[151:45.74]I gotta pay attention.
[151:49.17]I don't want to overpower or over, you know, heat up your cellar.
[151:52.95]It gets real hot up here.
[151:53.99]If I would take my temperature right now, it'd be like 106.
[151:56.28]No liquid cooling.
[152:00.45]Oh.
[152:02.43]Hey, you thought that was going to be bad.
[152:03.77]It was a good thing.
[152:05.37]What the hell?
[152:07.47]What did that happen?
[152:08.51]I don't know, but it was good.
[152:09.95]Since when?
[152:10.64]What is in that ball?
[152:13.02]Wait, that was insane.
[152:17.06]You probably are so happy with yourself for that shot.
[152:19.06]I'm pretty pleased.
[152:20.16]They still have the wire thing at the doctor's office.
[152:23.83]Good.
[152:25.43]You haven't been to the doctor's office in a while?
[152:28.37]I've been frequently.
[152:31.66]Dude, if they made those like punch things, you know when you get like 10 free sandwiches at the subway and you get the 11th one free?
[152:41.02]Yeah.
[152:41.70]If I had one of those, if I had a punch card, if I had one of those, I would have had like four free doctor's offices.
[152:46.48]I think you're on something.
[152:48.67]I think that's not a bad idea.
[152:49.75]Alright, this is a long putt.
[152:56.98]Remember the wind.
[152:57.62]There's nine mile per hour winds.
[152:59.14]Does that matter when you're putting?
[153:02.09]Yeah, I think so.
[153:02.99]Oh, see.
[153:11.20]Oh, my God.
[153:11.78]It mattered so much more than I thought it was going to be brutal.
[153:17.75]Can you see like a like a what is it called?
[153:22.03]The ground changing colors.
[153:23.99]Yep.
[153:24.19]Mode is that's wind, right?
[153:26.94]Oh, wait.
[153:27.20]I think it already does it by default.
[153:30.96]Somebody said, have I ever done a sober stream?
[153:34.69]I'm going to leave that for you to decide.
[153:38.92]He's so sober he's doing decaf.
[153:41.82]I know.
[153:42.10]That's like so straight edge.
[153:45.49]I'm so annoyingly sober.
[153:47.91]Do you know what I mean by that?
[153:48.94]100%.
[153:54.45]What do you mean by annoyingly sober?
[153:57.68]You're saying it would be cooler if you were not sober?
[154:02.60]Do you have an excuse for your behavior?
[154:04.93]I'm just saying.
[154:06.43]I usually have a coffee.
[154:07.51]Don't worry, I'm drunk.
[154:09.55]No, I have no cough, no caffeine.
[154:13.16]Yeah.
[154:13.68]It's just like, eh, I want a coffee, man.
[154:16.64]But I'm on decaf, and that's alright.
[154:18.65]Decaf has like 99.9% less caffeine, but it's still got some.
[154:23.15]Oh.
[154:23.82]You must be sleeping so well, then, with decaf.
[154:26.84]Yeah, my sleep has been great.
[154:29.82]It's been a good change, then.
[154:31.52]Maybe I'll try decaf.
[154:33.13]I've been cutting down.
[154:34.25]I'm on one.
[154:35.79]One cup.
[154:36.71]I do one six-ounce cup of coffee in the morning, and I try to do as little boldness and caffeine as possible, and that's it for the whole day.
[154:48.46]Oh, that just feels... Why even do decaf, then?
[154:51.91]I feel like at a certain point...
[154:54.56]I don't know.
[154:55.46]I don't know if I even enjoy the taste of coffee that much.
[155:00.45]To me, it's all psychological.
[155:02.55]I just need the hot kind of bitter liquid.
[155:05.36]Oh, okay.
[155:05.56]That makes sense.
[155:08.62]Because then your body is like, oh yeah, I had my coffee this morning.
[155:12.11]I don't crave it.
[155:14.09]Do you get headaches?
[155:15.35]You must get headaches.
[155:16.59]Caffeine headaches.
[155:18.07]I've been doing this for about a month.
[155:21.55]Oh, okay.
[155:22.63]I've definitely had some of those kind of caffeine brain kind of crash out problems.
[155:29.50]But I think I'm alright now.
[155:32.16]I think I'm good now.
[155:32.95]That's sick.
[155:34.37]Maybe I'll try that.
[155:35.91]It sucks for the first couple weeks because you almost feel like you're tired all day, but once you kind of cycle it out of your system a little more...
[155:43.28]I cut my coffee from like four or five cups to like two and I felt like death I know the idea of cutting coffee completely is insane I know wait what do I do here it's like one of my favorite things in the world coffee's like one of my favorite things on Earth I'll even talk I'm craving it right now look at me I'm like not doing a sober stream oh
[156:07.19]Oh, bunker.
[156:08.73]Oh, right into the beach.
[156:10.56]No.
[156:11.68]See, but now you know not to do that.
[156:13.74]Well, I know now to hit this as hard as I can, special mode.
[156:19.15]Waluigi looks evil.
[156:22.19]Hey.
[156:23.95]I said it.
[156:25.49]It's too sinister.
[156:29.04]Okay, through the cloud, I guess.
[156:31.38]Why is it still going?
[156:32.64]I didn't want it to go that far.
[156:33.60]Oh.
[156:35.96]Into the spikes.
[156:38.56]This is like your childhood, remember?
[156:45.07]Actually, yeah.
[156:45.55]Where you had to pick it up from the spikes.
[156:47.67]Dude, even mini golf pisses me off more.
[156:49.64]It infuriates me.
[156:50.22]Do you get mad at mini golf?
[156:51.64]Have you tried top golf?
[156:52.82]What about top golf?
[156:53.98]No.
[156:54.10]Mini golf is so fun.
[156:55.44]No, I hate it.
[156:57.26]Where there's like a windmill and you have to get it into like the fun little barriers.
[157:02.05]I just love it.
[157:03.39]I hate it.
[157:04.97]I'm going to change your mind.
[157:05.97]One day we'll go mini golfing.
[157:07.98]I'm down.
[157:09.76]Yeah, see and then we'll learn to love it.
[157:12.74]That could be really good.
[157:15.40]Yeah, no, I'm saying what I just did.
[157:17.46]I thought you're getting excited.
[157:21.77]I thought you're getting excited for mini golf.
[157:23.59]That sounds OK.
[157:25.33]That sounds not that exciting.
[157:29.76]And perfect.
[157:32.12]No, we should.
[157:32.86]That would be fun.
[157:34.96]And I'm on the green.
[157:35.64]Let's go.
[157:36.70]I really do.
[157:37.40]It's just... Mini Golf just does this to me.
[157:39.38]I don't know why.
[157:39.96]Mini Golf and bowling both do the same thing.
[157:41.76]They're in the same... They're in the same folder in the hard drive.
[157:45.47]Right, right.
[157:46.23]Of... Like... What folder?
[157:49.03]It's not fucking useless, obviously.
[157:50.69]It's not in useless, but it's in, like... Games I don't like to play that every party has.
[157:57.90]Like, every group wants to do this, and I don't like it in that folder.
[158:01.88]Yes.
[158:03.39]Let's go bowling.
[158:04.13]I agree.
[158:04.90]No.
[158:05.64]Let's go mini golfing.
[158:06.96]No.
[158:07.46]Wait, what about bowling do you not like?
[158:09.80]I just, I don't know.
[158:11.20]It's the length of time it takes to do it.
[158:15.97]Okay, when you go bowling, it's like, oh, how many strings do you want to do?
[158:18.72]Oh, let's do, God, man, I don't know.
[158:21.26]Are we going to do like 10 of these in a row?
[158:24.60]What?
[158:24.92]What do you mean?
[158:27.01]Doesn't it take like an hour?
[158:29.15]You've been bowling before.
[158:31.02]Yeah, all the time.
[158:31.88]All the time.
[158:32.40]Okay.
[158:33.00]How many people do you go bowling with?
[158:35.80]Like four or five.
[158:37.14]Okay.
[158:38.04]When you play with four plus five plus people in bowling?
[158:42.02]Mm-hmm.
[158:43.03]you get to that point where you're halfway through the second game, and you see, you're like, okay, like, okay, Joey just went.
[158:50.94]This is going to take, it's going to take a long time to do this whole thing.
[158:54.99]And you end up having to go to the bathroom.
[158:57.15]How many times do you have to, like, look around?
[158:59.09]Hey, where's Joey?
[158:59.83]Is Joey here?
[159:00.89]Like, where's Joey?
[159:01.59]He's up.
[159:02.11]He's up.
[159:02.79]He's up.
[159:03.29]Where's Joey?
[159:05.22]Yes.
[159:05.32]I don't know.
[159:05.78]I don't know.
[159:06.12]Oh, he's getting food or something.
[159:07.82]Well, maybe, well, let's wait.
[159:09.70]We'll skip him.
[159:10.70]Joe.
[159:11.34]Joe.
[159:12.38]Hey, Joe.
[159:13.90]Oh, that's not, it looks like them.
[159:16.46]I wanted to be, if we did one string of bowling, I would have so much fun.
[159:21.57]Yeah, if it's just like two people.
[159:23.13]But can I, I'm going to push back a little bit, Jerm, are you ready?
[159:25.82]You're not going to like what I'm about to say.
[159:28.86]Bowling, going bowling with your friends isn't about bowling.
[159:32.93]It's about drinking a beer, getting a hot dog, walking around, roaming around while your friend goes, hey, Joe, Joe, Joe.
[159:41.86]So you're the Joey.
[159:43.20]You're the Joey that goes and gets the beer and misses his bowling string and we have to wait for you.
[159:48.63]It's like watching baseball.
[159:50.01]No one's there for the baseball.
[159:51.05]You're there to have a beer and not pay attention.
[159:54.70]I feel you, but when Joe isn't there every time he has to bowl because there's like eight of us and
[160:02.26]Yeah, because I'm getting snacks for the rest of you.
[160:04.80]I'm out there getting snacks, sour patched watermelon, just like the group likes.
[160:09.99]I'm not going around gallivanting being, you know, some selfish guy.
[160:14.55]I'm going to throw this back at you.
[160:16.62]That sounds awesome.
[160:17.90]When you got the big, oh, we went bowling.
[160:20.52]Let's get a bunch of food.
[160:21.88]All that pizza, wings.
[160:24.59]eat that and then put your fingers into these little hole like this like the you have to put them into the bowling holes is it greasy pizza and and by the way where are you the president what are you what are you too good to put your fingers in the bowling hole there's no there's no room for any of this food so it's like you're not stuffing the food in the bowling ball Jerma you could you eat the food and then you put your dirty hands in a bowling ball
[160:49.70]I hate that.
[160:51.08]I hate that shit.
[160:51.85]Get that grease off me.
[160:53.29]Okay, you got two pizzas.
[160:55.87]There's, like, sodas and beers, and it's on, like, a table as big as maybe one pizza could hold.
[161:01.38]It could hold one pizza.
[161:02.88]And it has, like, nine different food items on it.
[161:06.11]And, oh, shit.
[161:07.57]Did you want, like, chicken fingers over on your pizza?
[161:09.59]Oh, no, it's alright.
[161:10.09]Let me just grab that with my hands.
[161:11.51]Hey, do you want a slice?
[161:12.99]You want a slice?
[161:13.70]Oh, hey, did they wash these balls?
[161:16.42]Oh, no, probably, they haven't in probably, like, at least a few months.
[161:18.70]Hey, like, I just took a piece of pizza.
[161:20.42]Would you like, do you want a piece of pizza?
[161:22.01]Here.
[161:22.43]Oh, I just had my fingers in there.
[161:24.68]I'm out of here.
[161:25.28]What I'm trying to say is, like, you go down the line of logic.
[161:28.16]I'm getting kicked out.
[161:29.23]I'm getting kicked out.
[161:30.07]You're going to go into Bubble Boy.
[161:31.19]That's what's going to happen.
[161:31.91]You're not going to interact with anything.
[161:33.55]Like, don't even, why even go to the movie theater?
[161:35.94]The seat is disgusting.
[161:37.32]What I'm trying to say is, it's okay to, you know, just go into bowling and get your hands a little dirty.
[161:44.53]I can't.
[161:45.05]I mean, for heaven's sake, like, you get special bowling shoes.
[161:49.16]It's not, like, a serious thing.
[161:50.44]It's just for fun.
[161:51.12]I don't like that either.
[161:52.32]I don't want to put my feet in with, with, with your, but not you, but like, I'm just saying, like, oh yeah.
[161:58.89]Oh yeah.
[161:59.71]I'm size 10.
[162:00.94]Oh yeah.
[162:01.20]Here, here you go.
[162:02.42]Like, oh, okay.
[162:03.76]They spray it with some magic elixir and they're like, oh, here, this will solve it.
[162:08.89]And then they just hand it to you.
[162:10.05]I would love to see the science.
[162:12.05]I want to see the science on the magic fucking shoe spray that apparently gets, is like, oh yeah, dude, it's fine.
[162:18.30]They just,
[162:19.99]And it's clean.
[162:22.00]It's fucking Febreze.
[162:25.44]You know, like the term security theater?
[162:27.61]That's like cleanliness theater.
[162:29.37]I feel like I wouldn't want to put my shoes in a non-sprayed, like, you know, I don't want to put my feet in a non-sprayed shoe.
[162:37.63]I think the spray makes it seem clean.
[162:40.41]Like it's like, it's almost like an aerosol can or whatever.
[162:43.10]Yeah, I don't know.
[162:45.06]I never knew, and I don't think... Will we ever know?
[162:47.56]Somebody in chat is going to tell us.
[162:49.06]What is that stuff?
[162:51.65]I don't want to know.
[162:52.45]What is the magical spray?
[162:53.15]No, no, no.
[162:53.75]Don't answer this, chatters.
[162:55.43]I don't want to know.
[162:56.67]Because it's going to be like Purell or something.
[163:00.86]Someone's going to get it.
[163:03.20]It's Lysol.
[163:05.54]Oh, God.
[163:08.34]It's a Lysol antifungal spray.
[163:11.84]It's a disinfectant spray.
[163:17.17]I mean, that's fine.
[163:19.01]I'm just saying you can't live your life scared of putting your feet into strangers shoes.
[163:24.62]Get out there.
[163:25.58]Go bowling.
[163:31.80]How about you go bowling, but you don't have to wear, like,
[163:37.28]anyone else's shoes but your own.
[163:39.15]Would that make it better?
[163:40.61]Let me ask you a question.
[163:42.31]Yes, that would make it fine.
[163:43.93]Let me ask you a very important question.
[163:45.30]If you and I were just out right now, and it's like, okay, we've been out for a while, and okay, we're just hanging out.
[163:52.37]Alright, we're gonna go bowling.
[163:54.19]Would you swap shoes with me?
[163:58.62]You had to wear my shoes that I just had on.
[164:01.10]Do you wear socks?
[164:02.39]Yes.
[164:05.87]Um, yeah.
[164:07.35]I ain't doing it.
[164:07.71]What's the big deal?
[164:08.41]I ain't doing it.
[164:09.11]I don't know.
[164:09.55]I don't like that.
[164:10.92]Why?
[164:11.36]I don't know.
[164:12.96]We'll just spray with the magic potion and it'll be fine.
[164:16.59]Like if you sprayed it and there was someone working there who was just like spraying it or whatever, that's fine.
[164:22.91]Like, okay, can I ask you another question?
[164:23.97]Can I ask you a question?
[164:24.49]What about, like, gloves too?
[164:25.09]Like, I don't know if I would put you, okay, if we, if it was, like, really, I'm gonna be, listen, I'm gonna be fucked up about this.
[164:30.68]If we were in a, if it was, like, out and it was cold.
[164:33.48]Yeah.
[164:33.80]And you had, like, and I'm not saying you as in you, I'm saying you as in a general term.
[164:38.93]Right, right, right.
[164:39.59]Gloves, like, you had those, the, the really, like, shrink-wrapped around your hand and fingers gloves.
[164:46.50]Yeah.
[164:46.78]Yeah.
[164:47.20]if you were like oh hey take these and you hand them to me and I it would be like they would be like warm and it would be like sweaty and I I put these on oh I would I would I would hate it I would hate it okay but but I understand you would hate it but like do you not use and I hate to go here but do you not use like public restrooms do you want to know something crazy
[165:10.48]No, don't tell me.
[165:12.00]Oh, you are about to hear it.
[165:14.07]You're about to hear it.
[165:17.21]I am not kidding.
[165:18.31]This is not a joke and not an exaggeration.
[165:20.93]I have been very firm on this.
[165:22.66]I've been speaking into a microphone for 15 to 16 fucking straight years.
[165:26.86]I've never strayed from this.
[165:29.58]I have never, ever, ever taken a shit in a public bathroom in my entire fucking life.
[165:40.01]You're a germaphobe.
[165:41.64]Never.
[165:41.96]Oh, my God.
[165:42.62]Never.
[165:43.20]Never, ever, ever.
[165:45.48]You've never been out and you're like, oh, my God, I have to take a shit or I'm going to explode.
[165:49.21]How does that work?
[165:52.32]I just make sure I don't have to go or I'm good.
[165:55.98]It depends.
[165:56.42]I don't.
[165:57.91]Okay.
[165:58.53]You just hold it in.
[165:59.43]That's what you're telling me.
[166:01.92]I don't hold it in.
[166:02.74]I strategically plan when it happens.
[166:06.48]I make sure I only go to the... There's no way you have the foresight.
[166:11.01]What are you, that's so Raven?
[166:12.43]Like, what are you talking about?
[166:13.79]You know exactly, I swear to God, I have to go to the bathroom and it'll be like two seconds and it's an emergency.
[166:20.06]Like I have to, it's life or death situation.
[166:23.48]Okay.
[166:24.25]I've had colitis for a long time.
[166:26.81]Okay.
[166:27.53]So I have had to strategically plan around this for a long time.
[166:31.60]So I know exactly what's going on down in my gut.
[166:34.97]I can feel it.
[166:35.63]I can sense it.
[166:37.15]And I usually... Right.
[166:40.11]The worst superpower ever.
[166:42.81]It's like, I've never heard someone just describe their gut by saying, I know exactly what's going down there.
[166:50.42]I know everything about what's happening down there.
[166:53.52]I'm diaper wizard.
[166:55.04]So, I typically, especially like nowadays, I had a pretty bad flare-up last year, right?
[167:02.25]But like, forget about flare-ups.
[167:04.93]Sure.
[167:06.95]In, I usually...
[167:09.28]I usually have, you know what?
[167:10.74]Whatever.
[167:11.04]Who cares?
[167:11.34]We're both adults.
[167:12.05]We're both over 30.
[167:13.97]If you can't handle an adult like yogurt conversation, then you get out of here.
[167:19.09]Yeah.
[167:19.65]Why am I Luigi?
[167:20.63]What happened?
[167:21.16]Wasn't I Waluigi?
[167:22.10]Why did I shrink and turn green?
[167:23.30]We went back to the lobby.
[167:24.90]It's fine.
[167:29.34]Okay.
[167:29.97]Single core processing.
[167:31.93]It's alright.
[167:32.51]Anyways.
[167:33.79]Yes.
[167:36.33]So my bowel movements...
[167:39.29]I usually have one a day at the same time okay at the same no at the same time every day and you're saying like cutting coffee and stuff didn't affect your bowel movement made them better yeah but at the same time what time is that that's a weird question actually what time I'll tell you uh okay what is it four o'clock pacific
[168:06.46]I think it was, it's usually between like 10 and 12 is when I have that.
[168:10.66]10 AM?
[168:11.54]10 or 12 AM.
[168:16.09]Okay.
[168:16.21]There's one.
[168:16.75]Okay.
[168:17.01]I actually, so if you're going to go out in the day, you have to plan around it.
[168:19.75]Like you can't go to like a dentist appointment at 9 AM.
[168:23.67]It depends on how long we're out.
[168:24.84]Because if, okay.
[168:26.62]So you make sure you're home every single day at 10 AM.
[168:30.72]No.
[168:31.46]That's what you're telling me?
[168:32.24]You're like, listen, I can't make it because I have to take a shit at 10 AM.
[168:38.18]No.
[168:38.54]What about school?
[168:39.16]What about when you're in school?
[168:41.48]No, dude, I would go.
[168:42.46]I would, I would go to the school was only like, what's it was between.
[168:45.77]And by the way, this is a different, completely different topic.
[168:49.10]Okay.
[168:49.89]I had to wake up for school.
[168:51.84]Do they still do this shit?
[168:53.54]I had to get up at like 5 30 in the morning to be at school at 6 and 6 30 was in the bell ring.
[168:58.53]What the fuck are they doing?
[168:59.95]Is it still like that?
[169:01.89]Um, I was like that for me too.
[169:04.40]What is going on?
[169:05.26]Why would they do that to people?
[169:07.85]They're evil.
[169:09.50]Wait, so you had to get up at like 6?
[169:10.98]Did you have like an extra class in the morning or something?
[169:13.01]No, it's just that the bell rang at I think 6.30 and then 7 a.m.
[169:17.83]is after like homeroom and all that.
[169:19.58]That's when we got started.
[169:22.82]And you never shit.
[169:23.94]I actually respect that a lot.
[169:25.80]Okay, so fine.
[169:26.57]You know what?
[169:26.95]At the end of the day, I respect your decision to not like to go bowling.
[169:32.15]Thank you.
[169:32.67]You know what?
[169:36.84]I think that's fair.
[169:37.68]You don't have to go bowling.
[169:39.07]I have missed this shot every time.
[169:42.62]I've been losing like crazy.
[169:47.47]Though mini golf sounds really fun.
[169:50.19]Mini golf sounds fun.
[169:50.67]Have you heard of Topgolf?
[169:51.66]Topgolf is great too.
[169:53.32]I actually, for as much as I don't like to play golf, I got a mean drive.
[169:59.21]It is clean.
[170:00.75]It just goes that way.
[170:03.70]So you're telling me you're like insanely good at golf, but you don't like to play?
[170:07.55]Or are you like the star of a Hallmark movie?
[170:10.47]Okay, people would freak out, right?
[170:12.43]We gotta get him out there.
[170:13.67]He's the best I've ever seen.
[170:15.28]He doesn't show up to any practice.
[170:18.18]He's just... He's untapped potential.
[170:22.02]No, I don't believe you.
[170:22.92]I don't believe that.
[170:24.73]If you were allowed to hit... Okay, so you know you tee up.
[170:30.15]If I could turn my body and drive off the tee like that way, like not even towards the, it would be great.
[170:39.38]Are you allowed to do that?
[170:40.26]Yeah, I think you're allowed to twist your body.
[170:43.24]Like, could I, for instance, could I like hit it this way?
[170:47.93]Okay.
[170:48.05]Like, could I do this in like a golf game?
[170:50.89]I feel like this would be dangerous.
[170:51.79]Well, you're not going towards the hole.
[170:53.76]Yeah, but it would slice so profoundly, what I'm saying, that it would be great.
[170:59.00]So you're going to be like aiming at the audience members and you're like, no, no guys.
[171:03.61]Hold on a second.
[171:04.11]Let me, let me just get this ready.
[171:05.80]Don't everybody don't panic.
[171:07.22]Trust me.
[171:08.12]You probably read about me in the paper.
[171:09.37]I'm the slice guy.
[171:11.95]And then the one time it doesn't slice the one time it doesn't slice.
[171:15.78]Oh, there's a lawsuit there for me.
[171:18.21]Yeah, then you're screwed.
[171:19.49]Then you're going to be in jail and you're going to have to use the public shit.
[171:23.01]Oh, that sucks.
[171:23.73]You're screwed.
[171:24.43]You can't ever go to jail, Jerma.
[171:26.76]It'll ruin your streak.
[171:28.46]The streak will end.
[171:30.16]The streak will end.
[171:32.29]Yeah, you have to stay above the law here.
[171:34.93]That'd be so sad.
[171:36.37]Oh, that's so funny.
[171:40.04]Oh, we have the same stroke here.
[171:43.02]Sad.
[171:43.40]I gotta get this.
[171:54.45]oh a little still a little too much really it looks good though um is it stupid to use my special I don't know maybe not okay everyone said yes I thought you just soared that back to the teeth oh I think that was good
[172:25.69]Are you serious?
[172:26.77]What is this?
[172:27.33]Saran wrap on top.
[172:28.81]I don't believe it.
[172:30.80]No, Bowser got his hands.
[172:32.56]I don't understand how that didn't go in.
[172:34.60]I made no sense.
[172:38.29]Say what I mean.
[172:41.73]Too hard.
[172:43.02]Oh, my God.
[172:43.48]I thought it was a tap in.
[172:45.22]I'm good.
[172:46.00]That still worked.
[172:48.18]Oh, Luigi.
[172:50.57]Luigi.
[172:50.87]Luigi.
[172:53.20]That was that come out of you.
[172:54.50]That sounded really good.
[172:55.82]I thought that was in game.
[172:57.14]That was in the game.
[172:58.74]Oh, OK.
[172:59.80]But those sound really loud.
[173:03.15]OK, last hole.
[173:05.51]Have you been keeping score?
[173:06.99]I think you win this one.
[173:08.31]If I wasn't, if I didn't just look at the screen right now, I would have no idea what the score was.
[173:12.66]Yeah, me neither.
[173:13.28]I don't even know how many games we've played.
[173:16.94]OK, this way.
[173:18.82]Can you do a good Wario?
[173:23.05]Okay, damn.
[173:27.47]Yeah, so that just happened, I guess.
[173:31.00]I was not ready for that.
[173:32.32]That was... Can you do a good Waluigi?
[173:35.99]Sure.
[173:40.44]Everybody cheated but me.
[173:43.92]That was...
[173:48.97]You did like a whole line of dialog.
[173:50.95]I feel like I just went to a Broadway show.
[173:53.82]I was supposed to do a sound.
[173:55.86]We should do, we should make a Mario show and voice all the characters.
[173:59.99]You think Nintendo would be cool with that?
[174:01.29]Let me try Wario.
[174:05.20]Okay.
[174:07.10]Wario.
[174:08.50]Wario.
[174:10.87]Does he do that?
[174:12.54]Uh, not in my headcanon.
[174:16.97]Nice shot.
[174:17.93]But, um, I think we can take a couple of, oh, whoa, whoa, wait a second.
[174:22.06]That's like Bowser, that's like a Bowser Wario.
[174:24.75]That's Super Nintendo Wario.
[174:26.51]Wario's more like, wah, it's a me, Wario, wah.
[174:32.27]I'm thinking of WarioWare.
[174:34.01]WarioWare Wario.
[174:35.57]It's a little deeper.
[174:37.03]Here we go.
[174:38.48]Let's go.
[174:39.32]That is so WarioWare Wario, actually.
[174:41.56]Now I can't not hear it.
[174:44.34]Yeah.
[174:44.99]That's perfect.
[174:46.05]Where the fuck do I go here?
[174:49.01]Why are you swearing so much right now?
[174:51.39]That was a big F-bomb.
[174:53.82]I'm just trying to, like... I just feel like I sound cooler.
[174:57.38]My goodness.
[175:00.45]Where the... Where the...
[175:02.86]You're going to mess with our ad revenue.
[175:04.86]Now they're going to put us in the mature category.
[175:07.17]I know how many ads you run because we run the same amount of ads when we go to the bathroom.
[175:12.47]I actually haven't read any.
[175:13.92]I completely didn't do it at all.
[175:16.26]Oh, I leave it automatic too.
[175:18.42]But I remember last time we talked about it.
[175:22.20]Dude, I turned my automatic ads off last stream and I just never turn them back on.
[175:26.59]Oops.
[175:28.27]So people are getting pre-rolls.
[175:29.91]Is that what you're telling me?
[175:30.71]Oh, fuck.
[175:30.95]That's true.
[175:33.04]you got to make it automatic so you don't have to think about it but then it'll go on at the worst time yeah that's what I don't like it's crazy you can't just turn off ads in a channel it's not insane it's impossible oh now we're getting spicy oh okay yeah bring it on wait where am I okay look it's gonna slice yeah but this is your signature shot
[176:01.35]This is my, this should be awesome.
[176:03.29]Alright.
[176:04.13]Signature slice.
[176:04.80]Here it comes.
[176:05.18]Oh, wow.
[176:10.92]Oh, it's perfect.
[176:15.57]Wait, it's actually incredible.
[176:16.93]Oh, and you still have your ult.
[176:24.20]I do.
[176:26.02]Okay, the wind is going to go this way.
[176:28.81]But I usually run them during breaks because I've said this before.
[176:33.93]I don't know.
[176:34.29]I just don't.
[176:36.24]When I'm sitting there watching like a YouTube video, man, or it doesn't matter what it is, you're just relaxing, you're watching whatever it is, and all of a sudden it's just, Domino's has a two-for-one deal.
[176:46.85]Breadsticks.
[176:47.89]It's just like fucking God.
[176:49.81]And it's like you don't even know when it was coming.
[176:52.81]They just happen.
[176:54.97]I hate it.
[176:55.70]It's the worst.
[176:56.58]It's the worst.
[176:59.10]Yeah, I know.
[176:59.66]That's why I try to make it as low as possible to get rid of pre-rolls, but... And you don't have control what ads play.
[177:05.67]Yeah.
[177:06.73]So it's like, God knows.
[177:08.37]Like, apparently people get, like, Rogaine ads on my channel.
[177:13.22]I guess they're seeing, like, as a warning story.
[177:16.82]I wonder if it's based on the streamer.
[177:19.50]Oh, my God.
[177:22.29]Oh, that was a sick shot.
[177:24.25]Thank you.
[177:24.73]Hey, thanks.
[177:26.22]The compromise I have with it alright now is that you can't turn them off, but knowing when they're going to happen, you know they're happening, and I'm probably not even here.
[177:39.02]I'm probably taking a break.
[177:41.04]Yeah.
[177:42.22]Oh, and ads just started playing, apparently.
[177:44.32]Literally right now.
[177:45.73]Maybe they can hear us.
[177:48.36]Yeah, so people don't get a jarring hymns.
[177:51.82]Get your balding solution in the middle of Mario Golf.
[177:56.27]I get it.
[177:56.85]And there's no pre-roll.
[177:57.55]That's the way I should do it.
[177:58.93]But this pre-roll is right now, so I'm full of shit at the moment.
[178:04.08]I respect the people that stay through the pre-rolls.
[178:06.87]I see a single pre-roll, I leave.
[178:09.41]I'm like, there's no way I'm going to watch two minutes of God knows what.
[178:13.23]And I mean, I get it that it taking a, you know, turning off all the content for three minutes an hour is some people just don't want to do that.
[178:20.50]And that's fine.
[178:21.76]But yeah, I definitely, as I've gotten older, like getting up every hour is actually good for me, like physically.
[178:29.31]So I remember last time we did that, I was like, I should do this more often.
[178:33.48]I've taken more breaks now.
[178:35.42]Just walking away.
[178:36.26]I feel so refreshed.
[178:38.52]Do you want to take a break right now?
[178:39.92]I have to go to the bathroom.
[178:41.24]Yeah, we get to break.
[178:42.56]And let's do the run-around arcade mode after this.
[178:45.91]I'm down.
[178:46.61]I'm down.
[178:47.75]Alright.
[178:48.17]See you in a minute.
[178:53.15]I feel like it's better that way.
[178:54.79]It's just like this experiment of experimenting with ads and running them there, I feel like has been a success.
[179:02.94]I feel like people have been happier about it.
[179:06.14]I know this pre-roll is on right now, but I think it's been going fine.
[179:14.44]The one thing about the ads is that in the beginning of the stream is running them to turn off pre-rolls.
[179:20.47]That's the one place that it's like, I get it, but it's the only time I think that it's a pain.
[179:28.31]But I'll be right back.
[183:02.75]I'm back.
[183:04.68]I got a snack, too.
[183:06.46]Ooh, really?
[183:08.84]Yeah, some beef and rice.
[183:13.45]I'm energized.
[183:16.14]That's a little more than a snack.
[183:17.54]That's a dinner.
[183:21.55]I'm eating a dinner.
[183:23.25]I'm eating a dinner.
[183:24.20]A bowl of peanuts or a pretzel or something.
[183:26.62]I got like, you know, beef and rice and tall glass.
[183:29.40]I have a life-threatening allergy to peanuts, Jerm.
[183:31.64]I would never.
[183:32.84]Can you imagine?
[183:33.78]Oh, shit.
[183:34.14]Do you really?
[183:35.45]Yeah.
[183:36.27]Oh, damn.
[183:37.41]We're on standard golf mode.
[183:38.69]We should get on to crazy funny golf mode.
[183:41.95]Oh, shit.
[183:42.93]Should I leave the room?
[183:47.56]Or can you change the settings?
[183:48.70]I can't change anything.
[183:51.25]Oh, man.
[183:52.49]Wait, I have such a good idea.
[183:53.62]What is it?
[183:54.54]How about I have a bowl of M&Ms that are regular, and then one M&M is a peanut M&M, and every time I lose a golf game, I have to eat a single M&M.
[184:03.29]Oh, my God.
[184:05.35]Wouldn't that be awesome?
[184:06.73]That's fucked up.
[184:08.29]That's fucked up.
[184:10.02]It would be so exciting, though.
[184:12.28]It's like Russian roulette.
[184:16.30]Oh, my God.
[184:16.94]I can't think of anything more terrifying and more awful.
[184:20.83]yeah I need to get an epi that's russian roulette with like a lot of different potential that's too I don't know I don't I don't like this sounds like content to me and I'm gonna max out my ads max out your ads oh big time I know what I got is good people would wait can you re-invite literally 30 minutes to potentially watch me die
[184:44.86]The clips would go crazy.
[184:46.55]Somebody said, this guy's crazy.
[184:47.99]Alright, well, for like the last 40 minutes, I've been the crazy guy.
[184:51.73]So you can be the crazy guy for like 10 minutes.
[184:53.81]Okay, you haven't been the crazy guy.
[184:55.62]Can I just say that?
[184:56.40]Because the only one, dare I say, oddity about you is the not shitting in public.
[185:03.33]That's the one part that I find to be interesting.
[185:07.21]But besides that, no.
[185:08.97]And you don't like bowling.
[185:09.87]I had to remake it again.
[185:13.12]Oh, okay.
[185:13.94]Okay, now I'll send you an invite.
[185:15.94]What about laser tag?
[185:18.48]Are you laser tag friendly?
[185:20.47]Yeah, oh yeah.
[185:21.95]Okay, good.
[185:22.61]Laser tag is hype.
[185:25.09]Yeah, but you know how disgusting those laser guns are?
[185:28.11]Hype!
[185:29.68]Laser tag!
[185:30.74]Hype!
[185:34.08]Send.

[186:14.53]Koopa's my guy.
[186:16.75]Alright.
[186:17.21]Or Dry Bones.
[186:20.64]I've never heard... People usually say, I'm going to choose my main, my character, and they choose Yoshi or something.
[186:27.73]Not Koopa.
[186:29.17]Koopa and Dry Bones are my guys.
[186:32.71]In what games can you even play as those characters?
[186:35.19]You can play in Mario Kart, in Mario Party, I think.
[186:39.50]You can be Dry Bones in Mario Party, can't you?
[186:41.54]True, true.
[186:42.14]Wait, you're right.
[186:42.82]I'm just being hurtful for no reason.
[186:45.40]Mario Tennis.
[186:45.97]Dry Bones is cool.
[186:47.41]Mario Baseball.
[186:48.53]Mario Baseball.
[186:49.17]Dry Bones was legit.
[186:50.09]Oh, we go at the same time.
[186:57.64]Oh, okay.
[186:58.12]Cool.
[187:02.69]Now I sprint.
[187:04.75]Is there a punch?
[187:07.36]No, but there's a dash.
[187:11.56]I fucked up.
[187:13.60]Oh my God.
[187:14.44]How did we both screw that up so bad?
[187:15.86]You're in the way.
[187:19.95]Dude, this is... What the fuck just happened?
[187:23.47]What just happened?
[187:26.29]What?
[187:27.05]I don't understand.
[187:30.90]You have 30 seconds.
[187:31.82]No pressure.
[187:35.58]Here we go.
[187:37.56]Easy putt.
[187:39.64]Oh my God, my control is broken.
[187:52.21]Uh, alright.
[187:56.84]Why did we even need to go fast?
[187:58.32]Poor craftsman blames his tools.
[188:01.15]We didn't even need to go fast.
[188:02.95]You had to wait for me.
[188:05.01]Is there like a time bonus perhaps?
[188:11.26]What are you aiming at me for?
[188:12.86]Chill.
[188:13.00]I just putted it at you.
[188:21.47]Are you trying to kill Toad?
[188:22.63]Oh, I forgot.
[188:23.95]Oh, I have a special dash.
[188:31.16]Let's go.
[188:36.00]Ooh.
[188:39.87]Sink it.
[188:41.64]Oh, close.
[188:43.08]I was actually really close.
[188:46.30]I wonder how time, like, it says 2 and 21, 4 and 32.
[188:49.05]Is that maybe at the end they give us, like, additional points?
[188:53.54]You probably get points for, yeah, for the time difference.
[188:57.12]Oh, I see.
[188:58.06]Oh, and then the higher the score this time.
[189:02.61]Okay.
[189:04.57]This is a weird variant.
[189:05.63]I'm going to try for real this time.
[189:08.36]Go for that coin.
[189:17.85]Oh, I just completely.
[189:31.37]Oh, mine didn't go in.
[189:34.84]It would have been so sick.
[189:37.64]I don't know how that went in.
[189:38.82]That was insane.
[189:44.87]Oh, there we go.
[189:46.03]Alright.
[189:46.47]Not bad.
[189:48.48]The drummer is going crazy.
[189:49.38]Wait, so that's all three?
[189:49.94]This is way faster.
[189:54.79]Oh, that's it.
[189:55.59]That is faster, isn't it?
[189:57.73]Yeah, I'm down to do that again.
[189:58.89]Yeah, let's do it again.
[190:02.54]I still don't understand how the running changes the game that much.
[190:07.56]Yeah.
[190:09.51]Fine.
[190:12.17]That's alright.
[190:13.15]But I also like seeing how you hit it.
[190:17.90]That's alright.
[190:18.46]Can you increase the holes?
[190:21.36]Yes.
[190:21.75]I don't think I can.
[190:24.15]Eh, whatever.
[190:25.41]Yeah, let's go to course.
[190:26.65]We'll go with a three.
[190:29.78]Yeah.
[190:30.26]Let's do New Donk City.
[190:31.84]That would be kind of cool.
[190:33.12]Oh, I can increase the holes.
[190:35.52]Should I do six?
[190:37.39]Six is good.
[190:38.03]Six is good.
[190:38.87]Okay.
[190:43.27]When you win, you sing the winner's song in the game, or are you asking me to do that?
[190:49.14]No, no, let's hear it.
[190:50.12]I'm down.
[190:50.52]That sounds awesome.
[190:53.80]I'd love to hear the winner's song.
[190:55.30]I didn't win.
[190:55.84]Yeah, but if you do, you have to.
[190:59.85]Okay, fine.
[191:01.19]Winner sings the winner's song.
[191:02.75]That sounds good.
[191:03.47]Deal.
[191:04.61]Now I'm getting nervous.
[191:05.53]I don't have a winner's song.
[191:06.85]We better make one up.
[191:07.49]I've never won before.
[191:10.02]So we don't want to win, is what you're telling me.
[191:14.59]I feel like the loser has to sing the loser song, no?
[191:17.42]Oh, you get little boost pads.
[191:20.35]Ah, that's what it's for.
[191:21.65]Okay, I get it.
[191:24.02]Ow!
[191:24.28]What the hell?
[191:25.42]You can actually hurt each other.
[191:28.95]I just ran into the wall.
[191:30.78]I heard that.
[191:31.54]I was like, what was that?
[191:33.70]I didn't even know that was possible.
[191:35.20]No!
[191:37.48]There we go.
[191:38.44]Alright, there's no way.
[191:39.45]You're definitely gonna... I'm gonna beat this one.
[191:41.25]No, no.
[191:42.47]Now you get to win this.
[191:43.67]You get to sing the song.
[191:44.79]That's so sad.
[191:45.63]Wait, we got this.
[191:47.37]We got a par.
[191:48.14]Wait, it's not so bad.
[191:48.92]How did you... You sank that?
[191:51.52]Yeah.
[191:53.54]You can jump on each other's stuff.
[191:55.76]Since you did it first, you get an extra point.
[191:59.33]I see.
[192:00.12]Oh, okay.
[192:04.09]I changed my stick.
[192:07.77]What's it called?
[192:08.47]Club?
[192:09.74]Stick.
[192:12.18]I don't remember what the correct... Oh, no.
[192:19.51]What are you doing?
[192:20.85]Trying to mess you up.
[192:21.43]Are you BMing me?
[192:23.82]Mm-hmm.
[192:23.98]Alright.
[192:24.20]You want to play like that?
[192:24.98]I see.
[192:25.80]You just ricocheted off the building and it was an awesome shot.
[192:32.17]Oh, you sink that?
[192:35.95]That's crazy.
[192:38.68]You're so lucky.
[192:43.33]You're so lucky.
[192:44.35]Don't brag.
[192:45.21]Okay.
[192:48.87]Beautiful.
[192:49.66]Wait, are you a tenor?
[192:51.28]Yeah.
[192:53.18]I hear it.
[192:54.80]You ever do choir?
[192:56.38]Dude, I'm a ten in everything.
[192:57.66]I'm a tenner in that and singing.
[192:59.40]I'm a tenner in golf.
[193:00.60]I'm a tenner in everything.
[193:01.86]Get tens across the board.
[193:03.04]Yeah, plus ten.
[193:04.03]Maybe.
[193:04.29]Nice shot.
[193:10.25]Ooh.
[193:10.95]That's going to be a hole in one.
[193:12.59]I forgot that I have to run.
[193:15.46]I just killed you.
[193:21.54]Oh, man.
[193:23.54]Jesus.
[193:24.73]Oh my god, that was awful.
[193:30.60]Oh!
[193:33.23]Oh my god.
[193:38.53]Wait, did you sink it?
[193:41.26]No.
[193:46.03]Oh, that's beautiful.
[193:48.79]You don't have any singing experience?
[193:50.69]Is it gonna be like a golf thing?
[193:53.61]You hate it, but you're so good at it.
[193:55.39]I don't need to sing.
[194:00.36]I can't sing.
[194:01.48]You have a story from your childhood.
[194:03.82]No, I'm not going to sing in front of people.
[194:08.69]Come on.
[194:09.33]Oh, fine.
[194:11.11]Fine.
[194:11.51]Okay.
[194:11.92]Alright.
[194:12.56]I really don't want to, though.
[194:15.10]I don't want to.
[194:17.72]Yuck.
[194:19.09]I don't want to.
[194:21.75]no don't no one want I don't think that's fine don't we're playing golf we don't you always do this you always try to get an excuse we're not going to care you're blocking my shot oh drained it I see you oh
[194:50.90]That didn't go in?
[194:52.08]No.
[194:53.18]Oh, I thought it went in right after.
[194:54.52]That was weird.
[194:58.17]Alright, this is the last hole.
[194:59.63]I know you're throwing on purpose because you don't want to sing, and now I have to sing?
[195:05.88]You clearly want to sing, Jerem.
[195:07.10]What are you going to sing?
[195:07.76]I'm Yours?
[195:08.28]What song are you thinking of right now?
[195:11.95]You can sing it.
[195:12.55]You don't have to come up with an excuse.
[195:14.49]Can I leak the DM where you said, please, can we have a segment during the stream where I get to sing beautifully?
[195:20.92]I've been working on a song for months.
[195:24.31]I know everyone's excited to hear it.
[195:26.67]Alright.
[195:27.85]In a world where that DM really happens, what are you going to say?
[195:31.78]What do you say to that?
[195:34.62]I would say, yeah, sure.
[195:35.87]Of course.
[195:36.91]I send you a Dean, I'm like, hey, Squeaks, I just want to let you know, like, I'm working on a song and I really want to spend like about five to ten minutes of the stream singing the song.
[195:44.73]It's not a joke.
[195:45.35]I really want to sing to your audience, too.
[195:49.05]Like, not just mine.
[195:50.78]Right, right.
[195:53.20]I don't know.
[195:53.58]I feel like I'd be like, okay.
[195:54.60]I would let that happen.
[195:56.00]Yeah.
[195:57.22]I'm just like, well, I want to vet the song.
[195:59.80]I feel like your eagerness thing makes me question what it is.
[196:04.29]Like, I'd be really scared.
[196:06.08]I'd say, oh, can I get, like, a private show of, like, just make sure that... Just make sure it's okay, because I got to know what the song's about.
[196:13.53]A private show.
[196:15.27]yeah I just want to know I just gotta make sure it's not normal to be eager to sing like what's the song would be my question okay but I'm like I uh it's a surprise I'm working on some stuff it's a surprise you know what I would trust you enough okay it freaks me it freaks me out so I'm gonna I'm not gonna lie it would not be dude why is it so hard oh no
[196:44.94]Shit wait you're trying to lose.
[196:49.06]This is a huge ice you can't throw oh no Double bogey, what the hell?
[196:59.17]What just happened I?
[197:02.24]Think you miscalculated that oh shit.
[197:05.22]There's one more hole Wait, I don't think there is
[197:10.37]Ah, that means we both have to sing the song at the same time.
[197:14.89]What?
[197:18.04]Oh, or neither of us sing a song.
[197:22.14]Alright, what song are we doing?
[197:24.17]You tell me.
[197:24.73]I mean, what songs do you know?
[197:27.45]Nothing from Snow White, clearly.
[197:28.97]Are you sure that's not like a 30-minute short?
[197:34.84]No, I'm 100% 90-minute movie out of Disney.
[197:37.95]They remade it.
[197:42.63]Fly me to the moon.
[197:44.92]Fly me to the moon.
[197:47.28]Let me play among the stars.
[197:51.45]Fly me to the moon.
[197:53.71]Let me play among the stars.
[197:57.45]Fly me.
[197:58.73]Okay, let's try it.
[198:00.30]Okay.
[198:02.02]So you want to go high or you want to go low?
[198:04.14]I'll go low.
[198:05.24]Fly me.
[198:06.88]Alright, so you have to- you- you have just- just called fly?
[198:09.79]Because we have a delay going between us, like it's like a tenth of a second.
[198:12.13]There's a delay?
[198:13.58]Well, it's gonna be because it's just like the- you know, there's a 50 milliseconds between Discord and here.
[198:18.52]Wait, you really want this to sound good, huh?
[198:20.65]I just want to get one harmonization.
[198:23.41]Oh, we get a harmon- I know a harmony for, um, um, what's the song?
[198:27.46]Oh Say?
[198:28.90]Can You See?
[198:30.83]So, oh, so, okay, so, oh, say, can you see by the dawn's early light?
[198:38.62]You're going on tangency.
[198:39.64]I guess it's going to be hard for me to harmonize that.
[198:41.60]No, no, no, but that's the harmonization.
[198:43.12]You're doing like a Shania Twain.
[198:45.80]No, no, no, you do the low part.
[198:47.62]So you go, oh, say, can you see by the dawn's early light?
[198:54.31]You do that part.
[198:55.49]You do that part.
[198:56.70]By the dawn's early light.
[198:59.44]That's how I harmonize you.
[199:01.16]You're doing both parts.
[199:01.88]Okay, I see.
[199:02.86]Okay, so you want me to just... We're going to switch left.
[199:05.83]You're going to harmonize.
[199:06.81]I'm going to harmonize.
[199:07.67]You sing it normally.
[199:08.49]You just sing it normally.
[199:10.09]I think you sing it normally.
[199:12.07]Okay, fine.
[199:13.26]Ready?
[199:14.52]Yes.
[199:15.94]I'll sing it normally, actually.
[199:19.04]I've got to turn the metronome on.
[199:20.30]Ready?
[199:21.26]Okay.
[199:23.41]Can we speed it up?
[199:24.19]I have my own metronome.
[199:28.34]That's not even coming through my stream.
[199:31.50]Okay, ready?
[199:32.16]What do you mean?
[199:33.01]Okay.
[199:36.07]Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light
[199:57.57]That was really good.
[199:59.35]Can I just say that?
[200:06.09]What?
[200:06.41]Do you want to know something funny?
[200:08.24]What?
[200:10.32]Singing on stream, there is a, there is like, I'm looking at chat over here.
[200:16.30]There is like a, is this like the software on your stream too?
[200:20.05]If you sing, people just go like, stop, stop it, stop.
[200:23.45]I can't, I don't want to hear anybody sing.
[200:26.03]another human being singing is such a knee-jerk hateful reaction to so many people over here yeah yeah people don't like it people don't like when you're vulnerable I think dude we had the game audio going the whole time with this crazy ass music in the background oh that's why they didn't like it oh alright let's try it again like if we maybe we mute it um
[200:51.53]Just, can you just hold an... Oh.
[200:57.13]Oh.
[200:59.38]I don't usually do that.
[201:03.95]Not like me.
[201:04.55]We're never going to make it to regionals if you just can't get the first note.
[201:12.46]We're flat.
[201:13.04]We're never making it to Hollywood.
[201:14.98]It's over.
[201:15.52]We can tune it.
[201:16.98]Don't give up.
[201:17.67]We're never going to get the fucking golden ticket.
[201:20.31]Don't give up.
[201:21.15]We always do this.
[201:22.01]We just have to be able to marathon it through.
[201:24.96]So get your fucking pitch right and we'll fucking do it.
[201:29.03]He's on his own.
[201:37.48]I love how instead of a song, it's Get it right, man.
[201:43.86]Let's go.
[201:44.28]Alright, what are we playing next?
[201:50.79]What's on the list?
[201:52.33]Okay, next game.
[201:53.59]Oh, let's see if Endless Ocean installed.
[201:55.92]Oh, either that or we could do Nickelodeon Kart 3.
[201:59.49]Oh, have you ever played Garfield Kart?
[202:02.89]It's alright.
[202:04.37]You hate it.
[202:05.74]It's alright.
[202:06.32]It's like a 7.
[202:07.52]You hate it.
[202:08.20]You actually hate it.
[202:12.20]It's a 7.
[202:12.50]A 7 out of a 10?
[202:14.71]It's like a 6.7.
[202:17.13]You hate it.
[202:18.09]It's going down.
[202:18.89]You don't have a decaying review?
[202:23.86]Like over time?
[202:25.46]No, like Mario 64 is a 10 out of 10 forever, right?
[202:28.56]What I do is I start everything at a 10 and then it decays.
[202:31.94]There's a time decay of about minus, it goes like negative 0.1 every hour and things in the game can increase it.
[202:42.06]Okay, gotcha.
[202:42.70]So you sit there with a new game with your arms crossed.
[202:45.47]And you're like, let's see what you got.
[202:47.63]And every time something bad happens, you're like, minus point two, minus point three.
[202:53.44]And then when it gives you joy, you're like, okay.
[202:55.84]Yeah.
[202:56.30]Slowly.
[202:56.84]That's how you play games.
[202:57.94]All games.
[202:59.67]Ones that I'm reviewing.
[203:01.97]Oh, yeah.
[203:02.21]You're a professional reviewer.
[203:03.31]How could I forget?
[203:05.65]What's the best game of all time?
[203:08.36]Is Endless Ocean installed?
[203:11.58]No, Endless Ocean is not installed.
[203:13.88]Do you have Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3?
[203:17.07]Yes.
[203:18.15]Alright, let's do that.
[203:22.96]What's the best game of all time?
[203:25.19]Oh, Squeaks, this is a perfect opportunity to talk about this.
[203:28.50]Okay.
[203:29.06]Monster Rancher 2.
[203:31.17]oh yes that's a good game I played on the PlayStation let's give you I want to give you the rules yes uh so for those who don't know squeaks is going to be in the tournament uh it's a very serious tournament it's one of the most it's going to be taken very seriously by three of us at least at least two of us are going to take it dead seriously I'll take it seriously I mean what do you mean
[203:52.87]okay so at least three of us will yeah um so how you're gonna do this is you cannot you have to have three monsters so three monsters they have to be your three favorite songs Monster Rancher has a thing you probably you know the system right so I don't remember that it's been a long time
[204:12.29]So Monster Rancher had a cool thing where you put a CD in and no matter what the CD was, as long as it had data on the CD, is there a prize?
[204:20.87]We're not talking about, no, there's no prize.
[204:22.59]The prize is gloating.
[204:26.09]So you put a CD in, let's, for instance, let's say you put in Big Mama's House 2, like the DVD.
[204:31.96]Weird, that's on the tip of your tongue, but fine.
[204:35.21]I mean, that's your default.
[204:37.55]I own that movie on DVD and Blu-ray.
[204:39.82]I own the whole trilogy.
[204:42.46]Right.
[204:42.72]And you didn't know if Snow White was a movie, right?
[204:44.85]That was what was a little confusing.
[204:47.73]That's your priority, right?
[204:48.87]I just want to clarify for the folks at home.
[204:52.68]Didn't know that Snow White was a movie, but knows Big Mama's House 1 and 2 and 3.
[204:59.34]I didn't mean to interrupt.
[205:01.27]Keep going.
[205:01.87]So let's just say you put in Big Mama's House 2.
[205:05.13]Right.
[205:06.68]There would be a unique seed attached to that disk in Monster Rancher 2.
[205:13.71]Yeah.
[205:14.37]What the game does, the remake or the remaster, whatever you want to call it,
[205:17.79]you it's a giant database of all that data I don't think it's all complete I don't think it's all there but a lot of it's there a ton of music a ton of I think a ton of dvds and movies might be on there too but we're doing music so you are to go to that database when you pull a monster and you're putting in your favorite songs of all time I have a very important question for you because this is going to determine if I like you or not okay oh okay I'm nervous this is very important
[205:44.55]When you hear the song Rainbow Connection by Kermit the Frog, what happens?
[205:55.33]What happens to like, what happens like emotionally to me?
[205:58.75]I'm just going to stop talking.
[206:00.50]Rainbow Connection, the song Rainbow Connection by Kermit the Frog.
[206:05.52]How do you feel?
[206:06.93]I probably will just sit there, lean back in my chair and tap my toe.
[206:10.47]Do you say you like it?
[206:12.97]I don't remember what this song is.
[206:14.69]I'm sorry to say.
[206:15.41]I just have to be honest with you, Jerma.
[206:17.69]I don't remember.
[206:19.55]I have been getting flack for this.
[206:24.40]I think Rainbow Connection is one of my favorite songs of all time.
[206:27.52]Let me listen to it.
[206:28.24]I'm going to play it right now.
[206:29.82]Go listen to it.
[206:31.41]Rainbow Connection.
[206:32.71]Listen to the whole thing.
[206:33.97]By the way, Weezer has a version of this song, which is pretty damn cool.
[206:39.47]I've got to tell you.
[206:41.52]Weezer covered it.
[206:42.52]People owe Omega Long right now.
[206:44.90]To Weezer?
[206:45.49]Well, you don't have to do the Weezer one.
[206:48.07]Just do the Curb the Frog one.
[206:49.45]Okay, okay.
[206:49.89]I'm listening to it right now.
[206:50.85]So while that happens, let's settle for a second.
[206:54.98]So you need to do this with your favorite songs of all time.
[207:00.79]I need to play them?
[207:03.73]Or you mean put them in Monster Ranch?
[207:06.18]You need to pull three Monsters.
[207:08.38]I'm just curious.
[207:09.12]What would you say is one of your top three?
[207:11.96]Well, I like Jason Mraz's I'm Yours is a song that is up there for me.
[207:18.47]Okay.
[207:20.33]I would also say Hot To Go by Chapel Roan and Von Dutch by Charlie XCX.
[207:27.24]Okay.
[207:28.46]So I'm seeing a lot of trues.
[207:32.17]I'm seeing a lot of Ws.
[207:35.21]But I say Kermit the Frog and people give me Ls.
[207:42.34]He's Gen Z?
[207:44.38]Are you sure?
[207:44.84]Are you 33?
[207:45.42]How old are you?
[207:46.78]No, I'm not 33.
[207:49.65]How old are you?
[207:51.37]No, I'm 30.
[207:52.75]I mean, sorry, I'm 32.
[207:55.37]Not 33.
[207:55.71]That's good fucking taste.
[207:59.62]What's wrong with that?
[208:01.52]What?
[208:02.18]Kermit?
[208:02.92]Or my taste?
[208:04.26]Both of them.
[208:06.24]You're saying we did great.
[208:08.99]He's lying, he's lying, he's lying, he's lying.
[208:12.37]Who's lying?
[208:13.24]I don't know what they're saying.
[208:14.14]They're saying you're lying.
[208:15.96]I can... H-O-T-T-O-G-O.
[208:18.58]You know, like, I know the songs.
[208:20.32]Do you spell hot dog?
[208:21.54]No, I'm not spelling hot dog.
[208:25.25]No, it's hot to go, not hot dog.
[208:27.53]Oh, I thought you were saying hot dog.
[208:29.03]No, no, no.
[208:30.13]It's hot to go.
[208:31.87]Oh, okay.
[208:33.27]Oh, I know that song.
[208:34.22]I know that song.
[208:34.74]You know that?
[208:35.16]Yeah, yeah.
[208:35.50]I do.
[208:35.82]I do.
[208:36.22]Okay.
[208:37.52]Alright.
[208:38.04]So you need to pull these monsters.
[208:40.67]And we're doing a very good job stalling for you to install Nickelodeon Mario.
[208:44.66]I'm installing it.
[208:45.34]I didn't realize how big these game files are.
[208:47.67]Like, it says 48 minutes.
[208:50.35]Is this normal?
[208:51.59]I thought I could quickly download things like Flash games.
[208:58.12]Nickelodeon 3 is like as big as Claire Obscure, apparently.
[209:02.83]Yeah, Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3 should be like 16 megabytes.
[209:07.32]I agree with you.
[209:07.96]That's what I'm saying.
[209:08.96]That's what I'm saying.
[209:09.46]I didn't realize.
[209:10.30]I thought this was going to be so easy.
[209:13.56]No, next time I got to make sure I have all of them downloaded.
[209:16.45]So each one of these monsters, you can only train up to year two.
[209:19.35]So on their second birthday, you have to stop training them.
[209:22.42]Training.
[209:22.92]You can do whatever you want, but there's a guide.
[209:26.45]I tried to give it to you.
[209:27.47]I know you said, I'm going to go in completely raw, blind.
[209:32.69]I don't want to know anything, but I'm just telling you that guide could help you.
[209:36.76]Okay, I will end up using the guide.
[209:38.70]It's been a long time since I've played Monster Rancher.
[209:41.66]Are the people, are there other tournament members?
[209:44.09]Are they like professionals?
[209:45.59]A couple people know what they're doing, I think.
[209:47.25]Criken knows what he's doing from what I know.
[209:50.19]I know what I'm doing from what I know.
[209:52.22]So wait, so let me get this straight.
[209:53.43]You made this tournament so you can beat everybody at Monster Rancher.
[209:56.91]Is this what, is this what you're like?
[210:00.63]Yeah.
[210:01.90]Yes.
[210:03.94]Yeah.
[210:05.54]Do you feel good about yourself with that?
[210:07.30]I mean, is that how you want to win?
[210:08.80]Yeah.
[210:11.57]Right.
[210:12.03]Okay.
[210:12.41]Well, I'm just gonna have to train really hard because maybe I'll be a little bit of a surprise, uh, rancher myself.
[210:20.41]Also, drugs are allowed because I think Vinny trained his monster for like an hour.
[210:26.19]Yeah.
[210:27.83]Vinny's probably going to have to have his monster do a ton of drugs, but that's fine.
[210:32.64]Oh, so it's not a sober stream.
[210:34.50]There's a lot of stuff you can give the monsters, and I think some people are going to have to dope up their monsters.
[210:41.17]I'm going to try to find the worst way to win.
[210:43.63]I'm going to really juice up my monster.
[210:46.81]I'm very curious about what you're going to do.
[210:49.32]I think it'll be fun.
[210:50.26]But it'll be fun.
[210:50.66]But it's two years.
[210:52.28]Each monster takes about an hour or two to train.
[210:54.37]And how many monsters again?
[210:56.63]Sorry, as a reminder.
[210:57.61]Three.
[210:58.35]Three monsters.
[210:59.07]Three favorite songs.
[211:00.98]Gotcha.
[211:02.06]So it'll be like six hours of prep.
[211:04.04]It's like between like three and five it'll take.
[211:06.64]You don't have to do it on stream.
[211:07.71]You can do it off stream.
[211:08.41]But now that we just said that on stream, your chat probably now is not going to let you not do this off stream.
[211:14.31]So...
[211:15.42]yeah but I don't listen sometimes I do it stuff off stream yeah like how nice would it do me to play on the Steam Deck you know I'm sitting in my bed and my recline six hours of homework I know I'm giving I give people homework I know it's I'm sorry is and everyone's gonna be ready apparently that's what I'm told I'm excited I have I actually have work to do then play um this is soon this is soon right this is 28. oh you're gonna wait you've never played um pretty derby
[211:41.44]I've seen people play it.
[211:43.30]It looked interesting.
[211:44.84]Oh, by the way, it's whole albums primarily.
[211:48.63]One of my mods is telling me that I forgot to say this.
[211:51.43]The spelling of the title or artist has to be exact.
[211:55.09]It has a lot of albums, mostly.
[211:57.48]Oh, it's an album.
[211:58.82]There's tons of albums on there.
[212:00.52]You'll see when you start searching.
[212:02.22]I'm going to go to BRB.
[212:04.43]I'm going to feed my dog.
[212:06.13]I'm going to be a few minutes.
[212:07.89]You can install your stuff and we'll be right back.
[212:10.40]Perfect.
[212:10.84]Sounds good.
[212:12.03]Hell yeah.
[217:49.26]I'm back I listened to uh rainbow connection okay and how do you feel it's a beautiful song I thought it was gonna be like uh you know like some silly thing but it was nice I liked it impeccable taste see saved I have a heart absolutely absolutely impeccable taste
[218:11.50]Thank you.
[218:12.35]It was good.
[218:12.93]I knew I liked you.
[218:13.91]You know what I mean?
[218:14.83]Oh, thanks.
[218:15.55]Yeah, listen.
[218:16.67]But if I said I didn't like it, you would have hung up, right?
[218:20.26]I probably would have hung up and I probably would have ghosted every single message you ever sent ever again.
[218:24.71]But, alright.
[218:26.51]He likes it.
[218:27.55]Alright.
[218:27.91]Yes, and we're back and let's check the download.
[218:30.46]How's Nickelodeon Kart Racers?
[218:33.48]It's really good if you're willing to wait 44 minutes.
[218:37.78]still I don't know I don't know what happened uh alright what else we got we got other stuff what else you got I got this for next time for switch Sunday every Sunday I mean we do this all the time exactly you know um no biggie we got uh mousetrap wait is this is this mousetrap like the game you ever played like the board game mousetrap I don't even know how the game works
[219:06.94]I would just build it and then, uh, never know how to work and just like set off that.
[219:12.13]What's it called?
[219:12.59]Rue, whatever.
[219:14.35]Yeah.
[219:14.59]The, the, it's like the one thing, the, the boot kicks the marble, the marble goes in the bucket.
[219:20.14]Yes.
[219:23.44]Yeah.

[219:28.69]Yeah.
[219:29.35]I have, do you have overcooked too?
[219:31.41]That could be fun.
[219:32.67]I do have Overcooked 2, but I don't really love that game.
[219:38.51]Okay, we don't have to play it.
[219:40.60]I've never played it.
[219:43.22]Oh, you've never played it?
[219:44.54]No, never.
[219:45.96]Oh, okay.
[219:46.54]But someone suggested it.
[219:47.76]I don't hate it.
[219:49.89]No, we don't have to play it.
[219:50.91]No, we don't have to play it.
[219:51.69]I don't hate it.
[219:52.23]Let's do something that Sparks joy.
[219:53.49]I'm going to do tennis.
[219:55.82]Mario Tennis.
[219:56.82]We could do Mario Tennis.
[219:58.12]We could do Big Brain.
[219:58.96]No, no, no.
[219:59.48]We're not doing Big Brain.
[220:00.84]Oh, Big Brain Academy.
[220:02.26]No, we're not doing Big Brain Academy.
[220:04.17]There's no chance.
[220:05.23]We'll do Mario Tennis.
[220:07.37]Oh, okay.
[220:08.89]Brain versus brain.
[220:10.61]I did crash out on this.
[220:11.93]I do remember.
[220:13.03]I remember very distinctly.
[220:14.59]On tennis?
[220:15.42]You crash out on every Mario game.
[220:17.28]I know.
[220:17.68]I don't know why I hate them so much.
[220:19.24]You know what?
[220:19.56]It's because Mario Baseball, they won't make a new one and it infuriates me.
[220:23.57]Oh, Mario?
[220:24.11]When was the last Mario Baseball?
[220:25.93]Like the GameCube or the Wii or something.
[220:28.43]Wait, that's actually crazy because it was such a good game.
[220:30.69]I know.
[220:31.11]It's actually crazy.
[220:33.98]Yeah, what is Nintendo doing?
[220:36.34]Nintendo's sponsoring streamers now.
[220:38.47]Are they really?
[220:39.73]Yeah.
[220:40.77]People were sponsored for the Switch 2.
[220:43.23]What?
[220:44.26]Yeah.
[220:45.12]That's what I'm saying.
[220:48.04]Except for me.
[220:51.12]Switch 2 sponsorship?
[220:52.02]I've given them everything.
[220:53.31]Yeah.
[220:54.13]And like Mario Party, Mario Kart sponsors.
[220:56.79]What?
[220:57.03]It's crazy.
[220:58.01]I know.
[220:58.29]I never thought I would say that.
[220:59.51]Give me that money.
[221:00.29]Give me that money.
[221:01.18]Give it to me.
[221:01.72]That's what I'm saying.
[221:02.58]I'm sorry.
[221:02.96]I've given them the world.
[221:04.12]I just got so angry.
[221:05.56]I got to settle down.
[221:07.61]I get angry like that too, I'm with you.
[221:10.96]But I'm on, hopefully they don't copy strike our channels, right?
[221:16.87]Oh, now we're both never getting it.
[221:19.05]Wait, you're right, damn it.
[221:21.67]Oh, okay, what shit?
[221:23.64]Say goodbye to that one.
[221:25.78]Oh, I'm just joking, I like that Nintendo ruined careers.
[221:32.13]It's cool, it's cool, go Nintendo.
[221:35.73]I find it funny that their CEO's last name is Bowser.
[221:38.41]I feel like that's insane.
[221:39.69]Dude, that is kind of crazy.
[221:41.39]Alright, are you in tennis?
[221:43.38]Yeah, I'm in tennis.
[221:45.52]How do we, is it co-op challenge?
[221:47.22]No, this is co-op mini games.
[221:50.73]Surely we can play against each other.
[221:52.67]Who did I play this with recently?
[221:54.61]And did I like, well, I'm trying, who did I play this with?
[221:58.80]Oh no.
[222:00.54]And by recently, I mean like three years ago.
[222:05.41]You played this with someone else?
[222:07.87]Oh, man.
[222:09.47]Sponsored Mario Party with the Four Horsemen.
[222:16.42]What is the Four Horsemen?
[222:19.26]It's just a thing.
[222:23.75]Wait, is that like a guild?
[222:25.67]It's just like a group of people that, you know, do stuff, you know.
[222:32.12]Oh.
[222:35.06]Like a club.
[222:37.22]Like an exclusive club.
[222:38.97]No, that's cool.
[222:42.49]That sounds awesome.
[222:43.11]I have a club of my own.
[222:44.86]What is it?
[222:47.70]It's me and three bots during Mario Party because I played it alone for hundreds of hours.
[222:55.43]But I was part of a book club last year.
[222:57.20]That was cool.
[222:59.16]No, it's, it's the thing that we've, and I just like put my, I'm like, I'm like putting my feet up.
[223:05.08]Like I'm like, do you see how I'm sitting right now?
[223:08.96]No, I can't see you.
[223:09.87]I'll have your stream up.
[223:11.17]This is my foot.
[223:14.45]My legs, my knee is up on my foot is up.
[223:18.61]You're totally, see what I'm talking about.
[223:19.93]You're so reclined.
[223:21.36]There's a huge hole in this sock.
[223:23.34]Alright.
[223:23.68]Online play players too.
[223:27.28]There's an online play for you.
[223:30.02]If you go to free play?
[223:33.76]Free play.
[223:34.65]I think we can just pick whatever.
[223:36.69]Oh, yeah.
[223:37.25]Okay, wait.
[223:37.57]It's easy.
[223:38.93]And I'm playing this with a controller.
[223:40.95]So hopefully there's no... Oh, yeah.
[223:44.02]Alright.
[223:44.46]Are we going to leak a lobby code or should I do online play?
[223:47.14]I'm hiding.
[223:47.40]I'm hiding.
[223:48.20]Online play two players?
[223:51.40]Players compete for the most wins.
[223:52.79]Only one player per Nintendo Switch console.
[223:56.03]Oh, shit.
[223:56.55]I just... Okay.
[223:57.45]It's like...
[223:59.10]I can create a room.
[224:00.88]It thinks I'm trying to do like two people at the same time on one console.
[224:07.03]No, no, no.
[224:08.03]Solo.
[224:09.77]Oh, shit.
[224:10.61]Hold on.
[224:11.69]Okay.
[224:12.21]I made a room.
[224:14.98]Oh, damn it.
[224:19.80]Okay.
[224:20.30]One player.
[224:21.12]You made a room?
[224:22.45]Yeah.
[224:22.95]I don't know how to invite you.
[224:25.08]I see solo I see open rooms I see yours and I'm just joining it right now we're good perfect perfect I see you surely I didn't just leak the code hey if you did how does it say our network connection is red yeah that's a that's a rancid connection yeah that's horrible I think it's been like that for every game hey my boy
[224:53.33]Oh, Dry Bones!
[224:55.89]Dummy!
[224:58.20]Dry Bowser.
[224:59.16]Like I'm your boss, I guess.
[225:00.64]Oh, there's a Dry Bowser?
[225:01.96]Dumb.
[225:02.54]I've never seen that.
[225:03.60]Let's do random.
[225:05.18]Okay.
[225:05.30]What do you mean dumb?
[225:06.32]Dry Bowser is awesome.
[225:07.65]That's dumb.
[225:09.15]You're like a freaking minion to Dry Bowser.
[225:11.45]You gotta respect him.
[225:12.89]He's gonna copy strike your YouTube channels.
[225:14.79]Nah, we ain't never getting that sponsored.
[225:16.39]Dumb.
[225:18.01]Dumb.
[225:18.64]Dumb character.
[225:20.88]Should be deleted.
[225:22.91]this is we can do top spin we can do lobs right in this special moves and stuff oh I have no idea I've actually never played this before how do you do like a regular hit uh looks like a that was a weird hit I feel like I'm they're charged they're all charged I think you can charge yeah whenever I hit age automatically
[225:52.46]I think it's R to do the super swing, like the special when that little star comes up.
[225:56.71]Oh, I see.
[226:00.27]Okay.
[226:00.39]Is this laggy for you too?
[226:02.44]Yeah.
[226:03.98]What the fuck?
[226:05.74]Whoa, he's really charging.
[226:07.72]Dude, that was actually kind of sick.
[226:11.37]Let's freaking go.
[226:16.29]Oh, so this is a game you hate, is what you're saying?
[226:19.10]I hate, I, yeah.
[226:21.88]DUDE!
[226:22.60]That, you sprawled it up.
[226:28.99]Wait, I don't have enough time to react, like it does it automatically.
[226:34.33]Oh, I got points for that.
[226:38.06]Dude, I- it's- Okay, I'm not gonna do a power-up.
[226:41.24]It automatically attacks.
[226:42.97]I'm gonna win.
[226:44.11]I'm gonna win without even playing.
[226:47.59]There we go.
[226:50.32]Smash my Wii.
[226:52.98]Well, that would be horrible because we're playing on a Switch.
[226:56.48]The Wii is a real retro console.
[227:02.71]I fucked up.
[227:02.97]Jerma, you ever stand in line for a console release?
[227:06.28]No.
[227:07.50]No.
[227:08.12]I've done it for a game though.
[227:09.00]I did it for Wrath of the Lich King.
[227:11.85]I don't know if people do that for games anymore.
[227:14.97]I wonder.
[227:15.41]They can just get it online.
[227:17.17]Digital.
[227:19.66]Oh shit!
[227:22.47]Why stand in line when you can just get it?
[227:24.98]How do you sprint?
[227:25.96]3 o'clock on Steam.
[227:28.20]Yeah, true, but wasn't there like a fun community?
[227:31.16]I do think it should come back.
[227:32.35]That's in line for the Switch 2.
[227:33.77]Did you actually?
[227:35.25]Yeah.
[227:36.49]Did you, when you checked out at the counter, did you turn and did someone take a picture of you doing like a, like pointing at the thing and doing like a pog face?
[227:44.26]No, unfortunately not.
[227:47.12]But why did you even go?
[227:47.84]Not that I'm aware of.
[227:49.00]I did park, but I don't know if it was captured on tape.
[227:58.17]The guy I was standing behind, he wasn't even buying Mario Kart.
[228:01.80]What the fuck?
[228:03.26]It's impossible!
[228:04.92]It's impossible, I told you!
[228:06.35]Oh, I think you have to aim it with the Joy-Con.
[228:09.63]Yeah, but I tried doing that, but it hit it automatically anyway.
[228:19.22]Oh!
[228:20.06]That was pretty good.
[228:21.03]That was good.
[228:23.55]Oh, maybe I got gyroscope control?
[228:25.51]You know, something's weird about my controls.
[228:27.94]Might just be the lag, though.
[228:30.06]I don't think I have it turned on, whoever it is.
[228:38.25]Oh, shit.
[228:39.81]I actually got to work.
[228:40.51]That was sick.
[228:41.41]That was so cool.
[228:43.56]Don't we have special, different special moves, or is that just how the specials that we get?
[228:46.86]I just hit R. I think it's just R.
[228:51.15]What am I supposed to do?
[228:55.72]This is aces, right?
[228:56.58]Yeah.
[229:01.35]Oh shit.
[229:02.43]Good luck getting that one.
[229:03.80]Oh, if I hit R it slows it down.
[229:07.68]And then I can run.
[229:08.77]We've gotta retry.
[229:11.21]No, I think we're done with this one.
[229:14.47]You're just the winner.
[229:16.52]Yeah, I just win.
[229:18.40]I don't want to be stuck singing this song.
[229:24.13]Oh, that's right.
[229:24.61]You know, the loser song.
[229:27.29]You can't make me stuck singing that.
[229:29.81]The boogers might be coming out of my nose right now.
[229:31.48]I don't even care.
[229:32.06]I'm too old to care.
[229:33.54]Yeah, who cares?
[229:34.82]That's part of the charm.
[229:37.16]You're on a recliner.
[229:37.94]Boogers are coming out of your nose.
[229:40.67]I mean, we can just turn the streams off and play, too.
[229:42.79]Who cares?
[229:43.35]Who cares?
[229:44.56]We could just play.
[229:48.04]Oh, shit.
[229:50.43]Oh, I was eating.
[229:51.31]Eating your dinner snack?
[229:54.75]My snack.
[229:55.45]I just got a spoonful of rice.
[229:57.56]Alright, here we go.
[229:59.74]Part of the charm.
[230:03.12]Boom.
[230:05.25]Boom.
[230:07.21]I feel like your guy is way faster than me.
[230:12.81]That is weird.
[230:13.35]You can like slow down time.
[230:24.65]Oh, sneaked it over there.
[230:26.27]Are you holding a button down?
[230:31.04]You would tell me, right?
[230:31.90]You're not going to win.
[230:32.52]Are you holding a button down to run?
[230:35.65]No, are you not running?
[230:38.07]No, my guy is so slow.
[230:40.50]I think that's just the nature of big, dry bones.
[230:44.31]Of the character?
[230:46.11]Maybe you have a powerful swing, but you're slow?
[230:50.17]Or is there like a bunch of stuff dunked up in your... Like I see you becoming a shell.
[230:55.52]You just killed me.
[230:56.40]I think that's just dry bones being goaded.
[231:00.23]Being so good.
[231:01.13]Okay, well then, I need to change my character.
[231:03.09]I think so.
[231:04.77]Oh my god, you used Wait Stick!
[231:07.13]You've been using Right Stick the entire time, haven't you?
[231:09.13]I haven't done that once.
[231:09.95]Now, thanks for telling me.
[231:11.60]Thanks for letting me know.
[231:12.66]Oh, no.
[231:13.12]I shouldn't have let you know.
[231:14.10]I can't.
[231:21.33]I don't have that.
[231:22.75]Right Stick doesn't do anything for me.
[231:26.00]When you're receiving the ball, try hitting Right Stick.
[231:31.77]Whoa!
[231:32.53]See?
[231:33.76]That was kind of crazy.
[231:35.16]You can really die.
[231:46.60]It's so slow.
[231:46.88]I feel like it's so slow.
[231:51.95]But Intel, as soon as you were doing that last game...
[231:55.92]I didn't.
[231:56.60]I didn't do it.
[231:58.62]They're making it up.
[232:00.78]They're trying to drive us apart.
[232:02.16]They're gaslighting you.
[232:04.68]That's how I feel.
[232:05.53]Okay, I won't listen to them.
[232:15.88]Oh!
[232:15.96]How are you supposed to stop that from happening?
[232:18.10]I have no idea.
[232:20.48]And that's you're using your R ability?
[232:22.58]That's R, yep.
[232:23.94]And then you aim it and...
[232:26.61]What the hell was that?
[232:27.97]You just did an Ephus.
[232:33.04]Oh, you missed!
[232:35.26]Wait a second.
[232:36.23]I did miss.
[232:38.51]How did you freeze time?
[232:41.41]Uh, I held R. This game is so crazy.
[232:48.62]It's really pissing me off for some reason.
[232:51.01]It does.
[232:51.45]This game is infuriating.
[232:53.33]Because I hit a button and it doesn't register it or something.
[232:57.29]Oh, that was awesome.
[232:58.31]That was pretty cool.
[232:59.43]Oh my god, two in a row?
[233:03.66]Excuse me?
[233:19.47]This is incredible.
[233:22.05]What the fuck was that?
[233:23.48]Why did my guy not hit it that time?
[233:26.87]That was a good volley.
[233:27.85]No, no, my legacy.
[233:29.34]It's been ruined.
[233:30.40]Nice job.
[233:32.46]You want a new character, you said?
[233:33.76]I need a new character.
[233:36.52]Like, desperately.
[233:39.29]Someone just said me when I figure out the controls for the first time.
[233:42.57]That's so rude.
[233:44.97]But true.
[233:46.96]But true.
[233:48.34]Alright, I could... Who's my second main?
[233:51.80]Dry Bones?
[233:54.25]Who's a fast character?
[233:56.50]Fire Piranha.
[233:58.45]I'm curious.
[234:00.17]What about Yoshi?
[234:01.61]Yoshi's a quick little guy.
[234:04.94]Yeah, Yoshi's pretty cool, but what's the difference between Petey Piranha and the Fire Piranha?
[234:11.77]Probably they're special.
[234:13.53]They're probably like... Alright, we're about to find out.
[234:17.72]I wish we unlocked all of these.
[234:21.22]Petey's powerful.
[234:23.77]I'm down to try the other game modes, too, at some point.
[234:29.35]I think this is a mini-game one we should try.
[234:30.91]Sounds fun.
[234:31.69]Yeah, yeah, I'm down.
[234:34.72]Okay, good luck.
[234:35.64]It's 2-0, by the way.
[234:37.34]You're destroying me in the games today.
[234:40.77]I got lucky in one or two of them.
[234:42.47]You beat me in Family Feud pretty badly the first couple times.
[234:46.10]Here we go.
[234:52.11]Has Yoshi had a game since Yoshi's Island?
[234:55.11]What the?
[234:55.59]Why did that not work?
[234:56.63]I pressed R and he didn't do anything.
[234:57.99]He just kind of went... I think R just is the power.
[235:03.68]You have to hit A or something.
[235:04.90]I don't know.
[235:07.50]Boom!
[235:09.20]It's crazy because I'm on the Switch too.
[235:12.10]You have better frames than I do.
[235:13.47]You have more frame rate.
[235:14.33]Yeah, maybe that's a disadvantage.
[235:17.09]You can see things in slow motion.
[235:18.27]You're like Neo.
[235:19.83]That's actually true.
[235:26.08]Whoa!
[235:27.92]I don't even know why I shouldn't have even done that.
[235:31.48]It looked cool, though.
[235:41.23]Okay, here we go.
[235:42.87]Okay, the meter at the top is what you're using.
[235:45.13]So that's like the stamina.
[235:47.02]I get it now.
[235:51.78]I missed.
[235:53.26]Oh, man.
[235:54.14]Game point.
[235:55.25]Do it again.
[235:56.80]I can't.
[235:57.14]I don't have enough stamp.
[236:00.20]I... Oh, bring it back.
[236:01.88]Bring it back.
[236:02.50]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[236:06.09]Do you have any tennis traumas or just golf?
[236:10.88]No, just golf.
[236:12.68]It's still rude of me to ask, dude.
[236:15.82]What if you're like, actually, I do.
[236:19.63]Actually, it's kind of ridiculous that you would bring that up.
[236:23.72]so you're pro tennis then you probably have strong views about pickleball then right I think pickleball is the form of tennis that people uh can play that don't hold on this is important why r didn't do anything and I pressed it a hundred times I pressed it a hundred times yeah I don't know what that was the ball it was the ball
[236:48.29]You say you think pickleball is like a good sport.
[236:50.88]I think it's fun.
[236:51.76]I think pickleball is fun and it's tennis for people that can't really do tennis.
[236:59.54]Wait, whoa, whoa.
[237:00.24]There's pro pickleball players.
[237:02.25]I'm saying for me as a couch potato Andy, it is way easier for me to pick up and be like, oh, oh, with pickleball than to actually get pickleball.
[237:15.39]one volley in tennis yeah how okay have you played tennis before yes how does that ball usually go terrible it goes somebody hits it across the net and the other one skyrockets it across out of the court that's how it happens almost every time I've ever played yeah but then you can have like a bunch of balls in your pocket that you can just pull it from
[237:35.14]Nobody that I ever played tennis with could ever return the ball more than three times.
[237:42.15]One, two, three.
[237:44.31]By that third time, we have to start over.
[237:46.75]Yeah, true.
[237:49.26]It's a lot of chasing.
[237:50.28]It's a good exercise.
[237:52.16]It's incredibly high skill.
[237:53.46]Pickleball is a more accessible tennis.
[237:55.45]I actually agree with this take.
[237:58.79]Would you say table tennis is a more accessible pickleball?
[238:02.84]No, no, less so.
[238:04.48]Totally different game?
[238:05.86]I think table tennis is the less accessible pickleball.
[238:12.29]Oh, interesting.
[238:15.82]I think pickleball is the perfect Goldilocks between tennis and ping pong.
[238:21.06]Oh, shit.
[238:27.73]Oh, I snuck up on you.
[238:29.23]I'm getting closer than that.
[238:31.57]Tiebreaker.
[238:33.37]Alright, good luck.
[238:34.35]Everything is riding on this, by the way.
[238:43.71]I just had terror in my eye from that.
[238:48.61]Because it uses motion controls or something.
[238:51.25]I don't know what it's doing.
[238:52.54]That was so sick.
[239:02.33]Okay, so holding R is something I still don't understand and I'll never do it again.
[239:10.64]Nice.
[239:11.64]Oh my god.
[239:13.10]I've got like depth perception issues.
[239:16.50]It's tricky.
[239:18.01]It's a tricky game.
[239:20.03]Okay, maybe instead of Mario Tennis, they make Mario Football.
[239:25.33]That's the game we should play next.
[239:27.49]That would be so much fun.
[239:29.06]That would be.
[239:30.60]It would just be the exact same.
[239:34.27]That would be the same exact.
[239:35.49]What am I talking about?
[239:36.31]It's the same game.
[239:37.95]Yeah, but Jerma, I'm about to freaking blow your mind.
[239:41.24]All of these Mario sports games are kind of the same game.
[239:45.12]And that's great.
[239:46.20]We actually shouldn't be giving them any more ideas.
[239:48.79]They have to make a baseball game.
[239:51.69]Oh yeah, they're never going to do that.
[239:53.57]Isn't baseball like losing views or something?
[239:56.09]Like isn't it not popular?
[239:57.52]I don't care how unpopular it is.
[239:58.74]They should make another one.
[240:01.54]They made golf.
[240:02.56]I guess golf.
[240:03.10]Is golf more popular than baseball in the world?
[240:05.58]I don't think so.
[240:06.08]I actually don't know.
[240:07.11]Didn't like, okay, correct me if I'm wrong because I don't know what I'm talking about.
[240:09.87]But didn't they change the rules of baseball?
[240:13.51]They did.
[240:13.75]To make it like more entertaining?
[240:16.40]They did.
[240:18.15]Yeah, there's now a pitch clock, which the pitcher has, I believe it's 15 seconds or 20 seconds before when they have to throw the ball or they get, it's a buck.
[240:31.23]There's now a pitch clock.
[240:33.09]Is that a controversial change?
[240:35.28]Um, I think if you asked most people that are baseball fans, I feel like a lot of baseball fans like the traditional kind of, it's slow and I like it.
[240:46.07]But for watching a baseball game, sometimes it can be three to four hours before some of these games are over.
[240:54.36]Yeah.
[240:58.35]Oh.
[240:58.83]Zero.
[240:59.13]How come I look 80?
[241:01.05]Who said that?
[241:01.73]I don't know, some dickhead.
[241:04.44]How rude of them.
[241:07.64]Also, like, looking 80 is not, like, an insult.
[241:09.91]Yeah.
[241:11.13]Yeah.
[241:11.43]How dare you?
[241:12.65]Yeah, it's cool.
[241:13.94]What is this?
[241:15.52]I don't know.
[241:17.36]I... I don't know.
[241:21.95]Superpowered move.
[241:23.83]I think it's because my thing was max.
[241:28.11]I'm going to do that.
[241:30.96]Oh, I think you're going to beat me before.
[241:36.49]Maybe.
[241:36.77]Can someone in chat correct me?
[241:38.01]Oh, here we go.
[241:44.66]Oh!
[241:46.22]Whoa.
[241:48.63]Oh, dude, I killed you.
[241:51.44]You broke my racket.
[241:55.46]Okay, there's a way to counter it.
[241:57.58]I see.
[241:58.26]You can parry it.
[242:01.17]Ah.
[242:02.27]Why does your racket have two greens?
[242:05.73]Did you see that?
[242:06.35]Like, stats.
[242:08.64]Maybe he's an unlocked stacked character.
[242:12.20]Maybe.
[242:13.02]Oh, that was good.
[242:14.52]Okay, let's do the minigames, if you're down.
[242:17.47]Yeah, let's do it.
[242:18.01]Okay, lobby.
[242:19.92]Oh, I hit chord selection.
[242:22.94]Oh, because there's a durability.
[242:26.83]Do we hit start?
[242:29.57]We might have to go.
[242:31.79]I remake.
[242:33.43]Hold on.
[242:34.20]Settings.
[242:34.72]There was a settings.
[242:37.34]Okay, wait.
[242:37.98]Hit A. See, there's a settings.
[242:41.83]Oh, settings.
[242:42.57]Can you change it?
[242:46.33]I can turn gyroscope controls off, which I should have done.
[242:51.43]I'm also down to do this again.
[242:54.32]Is it just the character select or will it go into the next menu or something?
[242:58.42]No.
[242:58.86]Oh, let's try it.
[243:00.10]I said I look like Jesus.
[243:03.07]That's a compliment.
[243:04.73]Alright.
[243:07.35]I don't know if I get compared to anybody looks wise.
[243:12.68]Oh, Al Capone.
[243:15.44]Al Capone.
[243:16.89]Yeah.
[243:19.31]Huh.
[243:19.93]Oh, and Chris Pratt.
[243:21.97]Oh, sorry, Al Pacino.
[243:23.80]Al Pacino?
[243:24.84]You don't look like Al Pacino.
[243:27.82]I forget which Al.
[243:29.46]Someone said it last stream.
[243:30.80]I don't remember.
[243:32.97]I think they just said a random celebrity's name.
[243:36.17]Yeah, I get that.
[243:37.19]It's not the first time I've heard it.
[243:40.31]Al Pacino.
[243:42.50]I don't see Al Pacino.
[243:44.41]Or like Ryan Gosling.
[243:47.02]Oh, Dio.
[243:50.58]Was that yes or was that a sound?
[243:53.14]I just made a weird sound.
[243:54.36]I went, oh, Dio.
[243:55.75]Oh, Dio.
[243:58.39]Oh.
[244:00.03]Alt.
[244:03.91]Oh, my God.
[244:04.24]You're the star from Galaxy.
[244:06.32]Aren't I so cute?
[244:06.92]The Luma.
[244:09.64]Dude, I just, that was crazy.
[244:11.72]What just happened?
[244:13.59]Little star guy makes me want to play Galaxy.
[244:15.21]When's the last time you played Mario Galaxy?
[244:19.56]Like, last year.
[244:20.82]Did you ever, did you speed, that's, why are you laughing?
[244:27.07]That's cool.
[244:27.49]I wish I played Mario Galaxy last year.
[244:29.83]I know, it's just so funny because I was just about to start Mario Galaxy 2.
[244:33.96]It's just a strange coincidence.
[244:36.42]I'll follow Squeaks for incoming Mario Galaxy 2 gameplay coming up.
[244:41.23]Yeah, that game rules.
[244:43.43]When was the last time you played a single player Mario game?
[244:49.00]I played Mario Wonder.
[244:51.53]Oh, yes.
[244:52.47]Not on stream.
[244:53.07]I did it off stream for a little bit.
[244:54.15]I thought it was fun.
[244:54.89]I liked it.
[244:55.88]I love that game.
[244:56.94]I feel like the game was severely underrated.
[245:00.00]I love the art and everything.
[245:02.04]I thought it was very, very fun.
[245:04.79]I liked the seed mechanic where every level kind of has that super crazy wild mode in it, so each level feels like it has multiple levels in it.
[245:13.12]Yes, yes.
[245:14.26]And if you don't find the seed, you just miss the fun parts of the levels.
[245:18.42]Yeah, so you want to go back and do it again.
[245:21.51]Yeah, it was amazing.
[245:22.83]You 100% should play Donkey Kong Bonanza.
[245:28.40]Would I like it?
[245:28.98]Do you really think I would like it?
[245:30.56]I mean, did you ever play Donkey Kong 54?
[245:34.87]Yeah, but I'll be honest, I wasn't really a big Donkey Kong guy, unless it was Donkey Kong Country.
[245:41.15]Yes.
[245:42.32]Okay, I get that.
[245:43.48]Did you play Odyssey?
[245:45.30]I did.
[245:46.48]I thought Odyssey was good.
[245:48.08]If you loved Odyssey, this is Odyssey 2.
[245:50.21]Oh, okay.
[245:51.16]Yeah, it's made by the same team that made all the pieces as well.
[245:54.61]I've heard pretty good things about it.
[245:56.86]Yeah, you've got to.
[245:57.86]I mean, it's not worth buying a Switch 2 over the... I'm like, you've got to drop $1,200, Jerma.
[246:02.85]For one game.
[246:07.07]You just gotta.
[246:09.68]Connery's Pants was telling me about something.
[246:11.74]This was a long time ago.
[246:12.92]He was like, oh, hey, dude, we should do, he wanted to play, there's like a camera.
[246:18.19]Switch to, like, get on camera webcam.
[246:20.67]You're kidding me.
[246:21.33]He did the same thing to me.
[246:22.72]And I bought it.
[246:24.56]It was $70.
[246:25.16]It's the worst purchase I've ever made.
[246:27.46]Is it shitty?
[246:29.30]I have to show it to you.
[246:30.92]I have to show you what it looks like.
[246:32.42]You're not going to believe it.
[246:34.15]Is it out?
[246:36.09]Yes, it's out.
[246:36.99]But no one talks about it.
[246:38.55]I'm the only guy who bought it.
[246:40.86]I told Connor, I was like, yeah, a lot of people just didn't buy it.
[246:45.76]So I'm left with this Piranha Plant camera.
[246:48.33]I am definitely one of those people that didn't buy it, by the way.
[246:52.74]Apparently no one bought it except for me.
[246:56.42]I've got to show it.
[246:57.42]You've got to remind me to... Because it's like, it was $70, and it was, it's like a 720, not even, 480p camera.
[247:10.05]But is it, what did you...
[247:13.07]Oh my god, the germless place!
[247:16.52]He's trying it in tennis!
[247:18.40]Holy shit!
[247:20.14]Oh my god, it almost worked!
[247:21.88]That's a lot, Harry.
[247:26.53]What was I saying?
[247:27.29]Oh, right.
[247:28.63]Yeah, because he said that it was like that old PlayStation webcam shit.
[247:33.79]Yeah, I forgot what it was called, but I know what you're talking about.
[247:36.80]That tiny, like, black block.
[247:39.50]That has like a camera on it.
[247:41.56]It's worse.
[247:42.14]I have that thing in my closet.
[247:45.73]It's ready to play.
[247:49.53]I wonder what games you can still play on it.
[247:52.90]Or even the Kinect.
[247:54.46]I remember the Kinect camera.
[247:55.78]I got a Kinect up there too, man.
[247:58.46]Alright, let's go.
[247:59.03]Next time is going to be Kinect Wednesdays.
[248:01.45]I got a bunch of original hardware, dude.
[248:03.80]I got a 3DO.
[248:05.74]I got Dreamcast.
[248:08.16]I got SEGA CD.
[248:09.26]I got all kinds of shit.
[248:11.55]Wait, that is original.
[248:12.35]I have an Atari.
[248:13.37]That's the only old thing I have.
[248:15.05]I got rid of them.
[248:16.69]Yeah, that's cool.
[248:17.64]I don't know if it works.
[248:18.56]Probably not.
[248:22.22]But if you go to these markets or whatever, there's so many old games.
[248:26.50]Even some Goodwills.
[248:28.40]I had this conversation with a few different people, and I want to get your take on this too.
[248:35.91]We, as post-30-year-olds, especially me going into 40, we are about to cross a threshold where
[248:44.30]a lot of the newer, younger kids, they are further away from the N64 to potentially care about.
[248:54.07]You know what I'm saying?
[248:54.75]It's going to be like the Atari.
[248:56.13]It's going to end up being like the Atari for a lot of young people, potentially.
[249:00.18]We're already there.
[249:01.26]It's older than the Atari.
[249:03.22]The N64 is so ancient.
[249:04.52]I know, but think about that, right?
[249:06.08]Think about when you grew up as a kid, if you are like 13, 14, 15 right now, you're not nostalgic for the Super Nintendo.
[249:14.17]No.
[249:15.19]No.
[249:15.49]Oh yeah, that is.
[249:17.37]So, so I think that a lot of, uh, we're going to start to see a lot of nostalgia soon for like the Xbox 360 and PS3.
[249:30.22]I think we will.
[249:31.00]I think the 360.
[249:31.83]That makes me feel so out of date.
[249:33.97]That makes me feel so ancient.
[249:35.81]You want to feel old?
[249:37.89]The 360, I remember buying that like when it came out and it read ringing.
[249:43.30]Yep.
[249:44.39]That is crazy.
[249:45.29]The red ring of death.
[249:46.26]I feel like people are already nostalgic about those, like severely.
[249:51.17]Exactly.
[249:51.72]Now, how many people going forward five, ten years from now
[249:56.39]are going to be like, oh man, you know, like Chrono Trigger for the Super Nintendo.
[250:00.91]They didn't, they weren't, I mean, Chrono Trigger re-released like eight different times, but the console itself is going to start to fade out of the nostalgia zeitgeist, right?
[250:13.33]Whatever you want to call it.
[250:14.29]You're right.
[250:15.29]Yeah, you're right.
[250:15.77]They're not even going to talk about it.
[250:16.83]No, it's going to get replaced by like the Xbox.
[250:19.05]Think about it.
[250:19.69]Imagine, imagine this.
[250:21.45]Imagine the Xbox One being your nostalgia.
[250:26.68]Jesus.
[250:27.58]That sucks.
[250:28.32]How weird is that?
[250:28.96]That actually sucks so bad.
[250:30.49]Yeah, that's tough.
[250:32.55]Yeah, the Wii U. The Wii U is somebody's, like, SEGA Genesis.
[250:38.97]That's so unlucky, I feel like.
[250:42.78]But to be fair, even the GameCube, you like the GameCube, right?
[250:48.45]Oh, yeah.
[250:49.25]But I think that we're crossing that threshold where a lot of the young people didn't experience the GameCube.
[250:55.36]The people that experienced a console at its release, we're getting to that threshold where a lot less people did that, especially young people right now.
[251:04.73]That's so sad.
[251:07.19]But people will still be nostalgic.
[251:09.24]Yeah, but you're right.
[251:10.06]It's not going to be the same.
[251:11.09]I think that it's even more important now to care about the GameCube, to care about the Wii, to play shit, to tell people, hey, look, dude, remember the SEGA CD?
[251:23.07]Oh, you don't?
[251:23.73]Well, check it out.
[251:24.49]This is what it was.
[251:25.17]This is how cool it was.
[251:26.08]This is why it was cool.
[251:26.98]I think that's important more than ever.
[251:28.80]I completely agree.
[251:29.76]And it's so funny because those games are still good.
[251:32.63]Those consoles are still good.
[251:36.11]A lot of people who make games now, a lot of indie games, they just take...
[251:40.24]uh these tried and true gameplay even like uma musume is Monster Rancher like of course the game is good did I get that point that did not that was not in wait what wait get on my screen the ball was somewhere else I think and I definitely did not score that point there's no way rigged rigged yeah I'm just about old enough to still have nostalgia I've seen people in chat say they're just old enough to still have nostalgia for the GameCube
[252:08.08]just old enough yeah I was like I was I remember buying the game to you I feel like by a lot my nostalgia is a Game Boy like Game Boy Color it's funny because so I'm
[252:22.58]at least probably five to ten years older than most people that are probably in this chat right now, and maybe even yourself.
[252:30.42]So, oh, return to lobby.
[252:34.13]My nostalgia is for the NES, the regular NES.
[252:40.66]I remember, I told you, my father did this thing.
[252:45.16]He would tell me, and this is when I was like probably six or seven years old, he would say,
[252:50.50]If you can get to Bowser with at least, I believe it was at least three or four lives, he'll beat the game.
[252:56.83]Because we couldn't do it as kids.
[253:00.19]Wait, so you had to, wait, so he like added that, he basically made sure you were able to play it.
[253:06.92]And then was he able to do it?
[253:08.42]Oh yeah, he would do it.
[253:09.24]Sometimes he would die two or three times, but he would do it.
[253:11.27]He would get there.
[253:12.71]Wait, that's actually amazing.
[253:14.45]Yeah, sometimes he would take him three or four lives, but he would say, you get me there with four lives and I'll beat it.
[253:21.35]And he was a god gamer.
[253:22.41]He was able to beat it.
[253:23.23]Yeah.
[253:23.59]That's sweet.
[253:24.30]We would go running.
[253:26.24]Me and my brother and my sister would be like, how many lives do we have?
[253:29.44]We only have two lives.
[253:31.64]Oh, he's not going to be able to do it.
[253:34.77]And then we would go get him.
[253:38.53]And he'd be like, hold on a second.
[253:41.19]Only two lives?
[253:43.77]Hey, watch out.
[253:46.12]And sometimes he would do it with two lives.
[253:50.83]Wait, that's actually so hype.
[253:53.44]That's awesome.
[253:54.32]I did not have that.
[253:55.90]My fans did not play.
[253:57.58]But that was NES.
[253:59.60]Yeah, those games were hard too.
[254:01.71]Those Bowser battles without like help or knowing how to do it.
[254:04.83]Oh, it was hard.
[254:05.39]It was difficult.
[254:06.05]It was really hard.
[254:07.44]Even those games were really hard.
[254:08.72]I mean, even getting to Bowser.
[254:10.16]I used to tell my friends I beat Mario 64 after going just to the first Bowser area and beating Bowser.
[254:17.67]I literally thought that was the end.
[254:19.77]I had no idea there was 120 stars I had no clue until like four years ago just beat the first area that's so funny yeah because you beat bowser I thought okay I did it like let's go amazing I mean you technically weren't wrong you did beat bowser I beat the bad guy I didn't understand that there was a hole upstairs
[254:44.24]And there was no guides.
[254:45.44]You would have to go to gamefacts.com and click that text thing that had ASCII art at the top and figure out how to beat the game.
[254:53.53]But if you were stuck, you're stuck.
[254:54.75]You got to go to school and ask people.
[254:57.58]So you must have been so happy when you realized, wait, you mean there's like 85% of the game left?
[255:05.79]Yes.
[255:06.61]That's an amazing revelation to have.
[255:08.98]It was incredible.
[255:10.28]Somebody said it gives you a giant key.
[255:11.40]Do you remember there's like rumors and stuff like, um, yeah, I know, but I just thought like it was the key to save the princess or something.
[255:17.87]Come on.
[255:18.23]Yeah.
[255:18.45]I would.
[255:18.71]Yeah.
[255:18.99]Come on guys.
[255:19.57]Give him a break.
[255:19.99]How would you know?
[255:20.67]How would you know?
[255:21.73]Um, but there used to be like rumors in games too.
[255:24.77]Like I remember in melee people were like, you can unlock Sonic by beating cruel mode in whatever, some impossible task and people would grind it and just nothing would happen.
[255:36.42]Oh, that's awful.
[255:38.34]it's so rough I don't I never I never like I I don't remember any of the like honestly the GameCube like this original smash I played the original smash
[255:49.03]And, but not very much.
[255:50.31]I really didn't get into melee.
[255:51.77]I didn't really get into the smash brothers.
[255:53.71]I thought it was kind of cool, but yeah, I really, honestly, back then was just like, oh, I guess like you fight as Mario and Luigi and that game, you just like bop each other in the head with like, you know, mallets and punch.
[256:04.64]Oh, boom.
[256:05.30]It wasn't like, oh my God, this is so hype.
[256:06.88]It was just kind of like a game.
[256:07.80]It was just like, oh, this is kind of fun.
[256:09.75]Um, yeah, it, it, it passed me, I think.
[256:13.15]Um, but I was a huge.
[256:16.89]I was like an absolutely monstrous super Nintendo fan like I had an n64 but I dude super Nintendo was I I live and breathe that game what games what games besides like the class like I'm sure you play like Super Mario world and stuff Mario RPG bruno trigger oh yes yeah um that's definitely like at least the top two uh also I was a huge huge fan
[256:41.07]of blockbuster dude and blockbuster was like oh me too you would go the the amount of stuff that was at blockbuster super Nintendo you just picked random it was like was there was there a case behind that one dude I remember there was this game I can't I can't find it anymore it was I it was called like the aquatic games the aquatic games and it was like an olympic it was like this little fish guy anybody know what I'm talking about

[257:33.94]And you rent it from Blockbuster.
[257:35.54]That's a crazy sentence.
[257:38.24]Uniracers.
[257:39.24]Uniracers, I feel like I would throw up if I played it now, but when I was younger, I could handle it.
[257:44.23]Yeah, Uniracers is amazing.
[257:45.55]I remember Uniracers.
[257:46.42]Do you remember, this is an N64 game, Hydro Thunder?
[257:50.94]Oh yeah, I remember Hydro Thunder.
[257:52.34]That game was amazing.
[257:54.13]Do you ever play Mischief Makers?
[257:57.71]No.
[257:58.14]Mischief Makers for the N64.
[257:59.90]It's an old Treasure game.
[258:01.42]Treasure made it.
[258:02.86]Oh my God, it was unbelievable.
[258:05.58]Mischief Makers.
[258:07.63]Oh no, I haven't.
[258:08.85]It's a good game.
[258:09.67]It's a good game.
[258:10.51]You'd like it.
[258:11.97]Is it like an RPG?
[258:12.39]Oh, speaking of games, speaking of games, I'm just on like a black screen.
[258:16.70]Yeah, me too.
[258:17.92]How do you change it to mini games?
[258:20.33]I don't know.
[258:20.89]I see singles only.
[258:22.97]I see doubles.
[258:24.15]Maybe we get out of maybe go to co-op.
[258:27.36]Oh, co-op challenge.
[258:28.68]Main menu.
[258:30.26]Oh, okay.
[258:30.58]You have to go all the way back.
[258:34.55]Co-op challenge.
[258:36.07]Oh, I think.
[258:36.93]Oh, yeah, here we go.
[258:37.55]That's perfect.
[258:38.66]I can do it.
[258:39.46]You need a joy con, however.
[258:40.92]That's alright.
[258:43.06]I'll just do it like this.
[258:45.15]Okay, this will work.
[258:48.32]See if this works.
[258:49.54]It does.
[258:50.05]Okay, so it might be just motion control.
[258:54.67]You think your recliner can handle it?
[258:56.63]I think I'll be alright.
[258:57.56]We'll see.
[258:59.50]Hopefully you don't have to stand up.
[259:01.28]I don't think I'm in co-op.
[259:03.22]I think I'm alone.
[259:03.97]I'm in co-op adventure.
[259:09.81]Oh, join a friend.
[259:10.78]I might be able to join you.
[259:14.28]Okay, I don't... I didn't make a lobby yet.
[259:18.36]We'll see if it pops up.
[259:21.04]But anyways, not to cut you off.
[259:25.93]Oh, no, I was done.
[259:26.83]I was just saying, like, I remember Blockbuster.
[259:29.07]What I used to do is take CDs from Blockbuster and go home and burn them.
[259:36.08]I remember I just copied them on Emule.
[259:38.06]There was this website.
[259:39.58]You little thief.
[259:42.22]Yeah, I was.
[259:43.78]Way back in the day.
[259:44.80]And I would sell it, if you can believe it, to my friends at school.
[259:48.31]What?
[259:48.53]You were a... You burnt and stalled games?
[259:53.21]You were a life of crime as a young teenager.
[259:57.50]I know.
[259:58.00]And then I'd buy lunch with it.
[259:59.44]Pizza and a cookie.
[260:00.62]Damn.
[260:00.86]Do you see my game?
[260:03.44]Do you see my game, by the way?
[260:04.82]I don't.
[260:05.62]I don't see anything.
[260:06.29]You don't?
[260:08.93]Four players are needed to play.
[260:10.68]Oh, that's not a good sign.
[260:11.90]Let me exit.
[260:12.92]Maybe it's couch co-op?
[260:14.24]I see co-op challenge.
[260:17.12]I hit co-op challenge.
[260:20.75]Play your co-op minigames in online.
[260:26.57]One player on this console.
[260:28.05]Wait, hold on.
[260:29.72]Yeah, one player on this console and then find three more players?
[260:32.66]Oh, it has to find three more.
[260:34.52]Oh, it's not a 1v1.
[260:38.47]Alright, what about, um... Can you do adventure mode?
[260:44.47]I feel like that would take a while.
[260:45.43]Adventure.
[260:46.21]Mario and friends are visiting.
[260:48.28]No, that's one player.
[260:49.60]We could do ring shot.
[260:52.40]Oh yeah, let's do it.
[260:54.50]Players one.
[260:55.40]Uh... Let's do ring shot singles.
[261:00.65]Okay.
[261:02.57]Uh... Is this even online?
[261:06.15]I don't know, is it?
[261:08.03]I don't think it is.
[261:09.77]Moon shot.
[261:10.97]It was shoot the moon.
[261:13.60]Moon... I don't think this is online.
[261:18.28]Yeah, unfortunately not online.
[261:19.92]Okay, I give this game a... That's going to hurt the score in my review.
[261:23.89]Six out of ten.
[261:24.83]That's a 5.4 on my end.
[261:27.47]I'm being a little harsher.
[261:29.19]Isn't it shoot the breeze?
[261:31.92]Shoot the breeze.
[261:33.22]I'm looking this up.
[261:35.00]Shooting the, shooting, shoot free, swing mode is apparently one we can play.
[261:41.74]Uh, no, it's single console or local.
[261:43.79]Shoot to the moon is an idiom generally means to aim for something really ambitious, even if it seems impossible.
[261:50.56]Yeah.
[261:50.74]Okay, no, no, Jerma, it's shoot to the moon, and if you miss, you'll land on a star.
[261:53.92]I think that's the full thing, right?
[261:55.54]Oh, that, yeah, that is the full thing.
[261:57.82]Yeah, because it's like, always go for it.
[262:00.13]That's a wholesome message.
[262:01.31]You want to do one more?
[262:02.35]One more game?
[262:03.35]Yeah, yeah, let's do one more.
[262:04.54]right what do you want to do um I'm down for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles oh okay uh I have uh I have a major confession to make for you what's that um I I was like hey we could do we could do Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that sounds awesome and uh I said that hey it's also on steam
[262:29.60]um but my setup right now makes that impossible for me to play any game on the pc right because it was a recliner you don't have a wireless uh keyboard I no not not available right now okay that's that's completely fine but you know what I could go download it on the switch but then we'd both have to download it because I have it on steam because you said it was on steam
[262:54.85]I decided not what actually I might maybe you can maybe I can we'll do it for next time next time alright what else for next time no biggie um I'm down I'm actually down this might be a repeat but to do some clubhouse games I would do clubhouse games that's fun let's do it because it's like a cute uh there were some really fun ones that we didn't get to yeah there's some good ones yeah there's also like some traditional board games one I saw that you did uh you added classic board games

[263:48.85]Yeah, and you didn't download off.
[263:50.29]Well, to be fair, I did give you that list at like 10 o'clock this morning.
[263:56.42]Yeah, and I had to go buy a mic at Best Buy because mine broke, so I wasn't able to get to the Switch, to be fair.
[264:03.37]Okay, I made a lobby.
[264:08.24]Oh, we got to play Connect Four.
[264:09.78]Wait a second.
[264:11.26]Last time, people figured out that we were the best Connect Four players of all time.
[264:16.27]We are pretty good.

[264:53.19]Okay.
[264:53.31]Okay.
[264:53.85]And then I ordered it and then I got it.
[264:56.22]And you know what shows up?
[264:59.54]It's this small little thing.
[265:03.06]Hold on.
[265:03.50]I can't even capture my screen.
[265:06.13]Can you send me like a picture in Discord?
[265:07.55]Can you send me like a screenshot?
[265:09.55]Yes.
[265:10.81]It's so bad.
[265:11.91]It's so...
[265:14.56]Yeah, I'll even go full cam.
[265:19.16]It's so sad.
[265:21.72]It's so sad.
[265:23.09]Take a really, like, you are hyping this up and it's an advertisement for it.
[265:28.65]Picture.
[265:28.95]Okay, yeah.
[265:30.81]Okay, great.
[265:31.39]I got it.
[265:35.16]Why do you look like, why do you?
[265:37.18]I haven't had that person up for a month.
[265:40.60]That guy is not watching Twitch sober.
[265:44.80]Okay, here it is.
[265:48.85]What the hell?
[265:51.67]I want a Nintendo sponsor.
[265:53.33]You're holding it?
[265:54.32]That's it.
[265:55.45]That's it.
[265:56.33]That's what it is.
[265:57.59]That's the camera.
[265:58.79]And the mouth opens, and then the lens is... It shows.
[266:03.90]But it's like this cheap McDonald's Happy Meal material.
[266:07.85]And the camera's 480p.
[266:09.79]Hold on.
[266:10.51]And it's like PictoChat.
[266:12.59]Like, it looks like someone drew you on PictoChat on the camera.
[266:15.80]It's crazy.
[266:18.61]so it's that I just I just jump scared everybody but so it's dude you look crazy right now you said to make it like you're selling the product you look like I don't know you look like a wax figurine or something thank you it's called a glass skin I just mean like you have pose it looks like somebody like posed you this way and you've been sitting like this for like an hour
[266:47.57]I really want people to buy the camera.
[266:52.38]You really, really got to sell it.
[266:54.64]Where's the lens?
[266:56.80]You have to open the mouth and the lens is in there.
[267:01.23]And this thing was 70 bucks.
[267:02.57]70 bucks, 480p.
[267:07.01]So if you can believe that.
[267:10.68]I'm going to keep you up here for a little bit.
[267:13.32]Got it.
[267:14.71]I love this picture this picture is it's like it's like freaking this picture looks ai generated okay listen I had no idea how big my face can get with my eyes and mouth and I'm honestly impressed it looks like I'm looking at a stranger
[267:35.11]No, it just... There's nothing wrong with you in this picture.
[267:41.00]It's just the pose and the demeanor.
[267:44.14]It just... It feels... Something feels off about this.
[267:47.04]I'm like a thumbnail.
[267:50.41]That's how I feel scrolling through YouTube recommended, Jerma.
[267:53.97]That's the face I'm practicing.
[267:55.04]Why does everybody do this?
[267:56.46]Can we be real?
[267:57.40]Let's be real, man.
[267:58.80]What the fuck does everybody do this for?
[268:01.20]Can we reset the meta?
[268:02.81]Let's reset it right now.
[268:04.86]no more views apparently that's what you know you're trying to trick you know some kids who are ignoring their parents to click the image oh my god the second we started believe they don't believe in like the Stanley Kubrick subtle messaging of a thumbnail they need like a hype no like you know just like no subtlety at all completely exaggerated
[268:31.08]The second we started, the second, you know what?
[268:32.75]Here's a hot take for you.
[268:34.03]The second we started making content for computers instead of people is when it all went, it all went downhill.
[268:41.03]Yeah, so like, what, 10 years ago?
[268:43.89]Like, did you ever participate in forums?
[268:47.02]Yeah.
[268:47.91]those are the days like now people are making posts for money not for sharing a hobby you know what I mean I feel like it's hard it's crazy by the way everybody the next sponsored stream is probably going to be coming up here in the next yeah that's right it's going to be the piranha plant by Nintendo I think we can really sell it use this pick from for the thumbnail of this video
[269:14.69]no no that well maybe I'm just holding a mini version of you okay yeah yeah squeaks is holding me can you guys do that version of Jerma yeah he's holding me of Ken that is not getting hold on that is a jump scare that's an eyesore I can't wait you're over there so
[269:43.31]Oh, perfect.
[269:46.57]Someone will put that together.
[269:47.77]Oh, I hate it.
[269:54.74]Stop doing this shit.
[269:56.06]Okay, you know if you had three wishes?
[269:58.71]Yeah.
[269:59.41]My three wishes would be world peace, give me a trillion dollars, and stop the fucking over-exaggerated thumbnails on YouTube forever.
[270:08.62]Those would be my three wishes.
[270:10.93]That's it?
[270:12.69]That's it?
[270:13.14]One of them is just for YouTube?
[270:15.18]It'd be one of my three wishes.
[270:17.32]World peace.
[270:20.05]I think that's good.
[270:20.81]World prosperity.
[270:22.63]And get rid of the YouTube, like, get rid of it.
[270:28.92]No more of those.
[270:29.36]Not going to touch hunger or diseases or anything, but YouTube, huh?
[270:35.99]That's where you put your foot down.
[270:37.35]That's true.
[270:38.37]You have three wishes where anything can come true.
[270:40.72]And you're like, you know what?
[270:41.70]The YouTube exaggerated face.
[270:46.34]You would basically delete my face.
[270:48.40]If I had 10 wishes, that would be up there.
[270:50.69]That would be one of 10.
[270:52.69]That's insane.
[270:53.33]You could end war, hunger, world peace, and YouTube thumbnails.
[270:59.98]Alright, let's take this to the court.
[271:01.90]Let's take it to the court here.
[271:04.12]Make it illegal, in fact.
[271:07.77]Somebody said prosperity encompasses that, I think.
[271:12.04]That's true.
[271:12.44]What do you mean?
[271:13.42]No, I think the algorithms like those.
[271:16.76]The robot overlords.
[271:21.03]Which one should we do first?
[271:22.57]You want to do air hockey?
[271:23.27]Let's do air hockey.
[271:24.50]Air hockey.
[271:25.38]I like air hockey a lot.
[271:28.27]I think I just said end world peace on accident.
[271:30.69]Whoops.
[271:32.25]No world peace.
[271:34.52]Imagine getting wishing for that.
[271:38.78]It's like the sequel to Aladdin.
[271:40.18]I feel like the genie would be like, what the fuck are you talking about, man?
[271:46.15]There's no confirm.
[271:47.23]Once you say it, it's put into law.
[271:50.15]Oh my God.
[271:54.96]This game is so scary.
[272:00.52]let me give you a pro tip uh use the put your joy-con and your you know what that's not a pro tip because I'm losing I'm not using a joy-con I'm using a controller oh the switch pro controller I stood in line for this boom did you make like a video of you getting it or anything
[272:24.99]No, I just did it for fun.
[272:26.85]You didn't do that picture?
[272:29.31]No, no, I didn't make a video.
[272:31.90]I just sit in line.
[272:35.04]Dude, you should definitely do an unboxing video.
[272:39.59]Of the Switch 2?
[272:40.43]Of the Switch 2, even though you already opened it.
[272:43.05]Yeah, I'll sneak in something else too where it gets Nintendo really mad.
[272:48.53]Holy shit, you're destroying me.
[272:49.51]Like, oh my god, it's Switch 2.
[272:50.59]It comes with a charger, a Joy-Con, and a rifle.
[272:55.78]Oh my god.
[272:56.00]I don't think you should do that.
[272:56.68]I don't think you should do that.
[272:58.38]You don't think Nintendo would like that?
[273:00.39]You don't think Nintendo would like that?
[273:02.13]This is so awesome.
[273:04.23]Thumbnail face.
[273:05.52]Hey, whoever was, whoever, like, was it Nintendo that was hovering over both of our names on, like, the should we invite them to the Nintendo fucking, like, after party?
[273:14.33]We've both been stricken from that list.
[273:16.86]Oh, for sure.
[273:18.08]But like, I might, this might be mean to say, but I'm comfortable not going to a Nintendo after party for my whole life.
[273:27.59]That's true.
[273:28.67]That's true.
[273:29.15]I actually, that's true.
[273:30.49]Yeah.
[273:30.79]Now you say it.
[273:31.41]That is not something I'd want to be at.
[273:35.63]Is your game frozen?
[273:39.59]Yeah.
[273:39.71]Oh, thanks, Nintendo.
[273:40.47]They heard us.
[273:41.87]Now what?
[273:43.63]Now I have to restart?
[273:45.62]Like, my whole console is frozen.
[273:47.36]Yeah, somebody broke our computer.
[273:50.64]Why did that happen?
[273:51.42]Okay, I'm going to restart the game.
[273:55.56]Restart the game.
[273:56.57]But I don't think that would have happened if we were playing Super Mario Kart Nickelodeon.
[274:06.00]You can't have a Nickelodeon 3.
[274:09.35]You ever play Lego Racers?
[274:12.35]You know that game?
[274:13.11]Where you can build your cart?
[274:15.08]Oh, man.
[274:15.86]We should just do a day of cart racing games.
[274:18.60]What's that thing on the left?
[274:20.43]What do you mean?
[274:21.39]That's my face.
[274:23.55]No, I think they're talking about this.
[274:27.04]I gotta look at my beard.
[274:28.44]I didn't even realize how big this was.
[274:33.66]Do you use any beard products?
[274:35.62]I've recently started using it.
[274:38.00]No, what I'm trying to do now is I'm trying to just let it go as long as possible and just see what happens.
[274:44.75]That's fun.
[274:46.39]It looks awful, dude.
[274:48.09]People said, no, you got to get through this part.
[274:49.64]It looks good.
[274:50.44]You got to get through this part.
[274:52.38]God, he's old.
[274:55.68]Caveman.
[274:56.14]You look like a caveman.
[274:58.22]Caveman?
[274:58.92]Jesus.
[274:59.77]What do people say today?
[275:00.99]Outdoorsman.
[275:02.92]That's good, though.
[275:03.86]That's good.
[275:06.20]I have my preview right here, and I have chat right here.
[275:08.77]I'm seeing people just fly through talking about what I look like while I'm looking at what I look like.
[275:20.24]How meta is that?
[275:22.08]That's got to be bad for the brain.
[275:25.02]I made a lobby, by the way.
[275:29.03]Aw, wait.
[275:29.43]Someone said that looks cute.
[275:32.05]That was so sweet of you.
[275:35.65]Time that person out for a month.
[275:40.44]Oh my god.
[275:42.60]Wait, what the hell?
[275:43.42]That's... Evil.
[275:49.85]Yeah.
[275:51.47]It looks cute on opposite day.
[275:53.77]Without evil there could be no good so it must be good to be evil sometimes.
[276:00.92]What's that from?
[276:01.54]I know it.
[276:02.54]It's ringing a bell.
[276:05.17]No.
[276:07.39]What's it from?
[276:08.45]You know it.
[276:08.73]It's going to kill me.
[276:09.67]It's going to kill me.
[276:10.87]Times have changed.
[276:12.34]Our kids are getting worse.
[276:13.88]They won't obey their parents.
[276:15.14]They just want to fart and curse.
[276:18.84]Oh, that's South Park.
[276:20.81]Oh, my God.
[276:21.51]Wait, have you seen the movie?
[276:22.49]What's that one?
[276:23.33]That's the movie.
[276:24.93]Oh, it is the South Park movie.
[276:26.15]Okay, that's why.
[276:27.77]um okay so no more air hockey I guess or do we go back I guess no more air hockey because it didn't work it crashed um we can do let's go back to connect four sure um full or sorry four in a row not connect four new south park season starts today sponsorship oh I heard they had a little kerfuffle with paramount
[276:55.66]I don't know really anything about I haven't kept up with any of the south park stuff in years but are they and they're not happy no I heard they had to like buy it back or something I don't know I haven't watched south park in so long I used to watch it when I was in high school it was a great show yes it's awesome that Matt stone and trey parker are so talented it's crazy
[277:20.81]Yeah, they kind of just decided one day, like, oh, you know, how about we just sweep the entire Tony Awards as well?
[277:29.04]The Book of Mormon won like every category that it was nominated for.
[277:32.00]And it was like 10 out of 14 categories, something crazy.
[277:36.65]I think they have one of every award, those two, like a Grammy, a Tony, an Emmy.
[277:42.06]It's pretty crazy.
[277:42.74]I don't know if anyone else has that.
[277:45.80]they they've got the the the list the shelf behind trey parker's Reddit shelf is probably insane that's all I'm saying he doesn't have funko pops like us or plushies no he doesn't have he's got awards he didn't have like toys and and and like super luigi plushies he has grammys and peabody awards and and Tony awards and yeah yeah
[278:10.89]They don't have like a Mario Kart Live Mario on a cart in the background, right?
[278:15.82]That'd be so embarrassing.
[278:17.38]He's got no Legos.
[278:18.86]That's for damn sure.
[278:22.21]Trey Parker right now is like looking behind him going, oh, if they only knew.
[278:25.17]He's got like every Funko Pop that it could be collected.
[278:29.08]He's even got Dumbo.
[278:30.52]The Dumbo that was rare that was like 3,000 bucks.
[278:34.48]He is a collector.
[278:35.54]I went to the Nintendo store in the city, and I was buying, like, a bunch of stuff, like, a bunch of stuffed animals.
[278:44.46]I bought an Amiibo.
[278:45.82]And the person working there said, oh, you're a very good dad.
[278:49.40]Oh.
[278:51.85]I know.
[278:53.05]I know.
[278:53.37]I was like, dude, you work at the Nintendo store.
[278:54.99]You should know I'm a man child.
[278:59.24]Did you say that?
[279:00.00]So rude.
[279:00.98]No, I just said I played the character.
[279:03.32]Did you go?
[279:03.74]I was like, yeah, you know, I love my kids.
[279:10.03]Oh, yeah.
[279:11.49]Little Dave's going to love this.
[279:14.30]You know, he's been getting good grades.
[279:17.06]And there you have it.
[279:20.63]There you have it.
[279:21.99]I can't.
[279:22.59]I don't know anything else.
[279:23.53]What would a parent say?
[279:25.51]I have no other dialog trees.
[279:31.71]Oh no, people are spamming question marks.
[279:37.11]Wait, I win.
[279:38.57]No, I was supposed to win.
[279:41.04]No, I won.
[279:42.94]Okay, this is like another situation like Family Feud where everyone in the chat thinks they're so flippin' smart.
[279:48.83]But when you're up there next to the board, you're not going to be able to see the wins.
[279:55.43]Guaranteed.
[279:57.64]Guaranteed.
[279:58.42]and you're talking about you're talking about the Nintendo store yeah not so easy try doing that I literally have three brain cells I cannot with connect four you have more than three brain cells just a bunch of them a bunch of them just don't work I wouldn't I mean I don't maybe maybe their hardware is old
[280:25.28]I wouldn't be so judgmental.
[280:27.39]I'm having some hardware issues myself.
[280:31.03]That was pretty mean.
[280:31.87]I was fucked up.
[280:32.62]I apologize.
[280:35.88]They're crying.
[280:39.17]Wait, wait.
[280:45.02]Squeaks, you need a firmware update, somebody said.
[280:48.70]Wait, mods banned that guy.
[280:50.04]What the hell?
[280:51.24]hey mods mods that guy is it can be what you want already mods ban that guy whoever it was I was going to give him immunity over here ban him for like 20 minutes let him think about it he's immune over here okay next game uh baseball yeah I think it's baseball kind of nice that one is still it's so fun uh do you go to a lot of baseball games
[281:16.40]I actually had the privilege of going to a Las Vegas Aviators game, but they did a thing where they changed the team name.
[281:27.93]They changed everything to the Gamblers.
[281:32.18]For one night, they were the Gamblers, and they had this awesome logo.
[281:37.17]It's a guy with a cowboy hat on.
[281:41.29]It's a cowboy, and he's throwing two dice.
[281:44.50]it is such a sick logo and I it is a one-day thing it was a one-day thing wait that's so lucky that's amazing and they actually were even considering I think changing the the name of the team permanently to the gamblers it was that much of a hit it was awesome it was a good time why didn't they that ballpark that's a great ballpark too the aviators ballpark yeah I don't think I've I've never been to you know what a Vegas game
[282:13.59]Hold on right now.
[282:14.29]Hold on one second.
[282:14.89]Give me one sec.
[282:16.21]Okay.
[282:16.61]BRB for 30 seconds.
[282:17.89]Tops.
[282:18.65]Okay.
[282:22.84]Is he going to bring a... I wonder if he's going to bring a jersey or something.
[282:27.61]I'm so excited.
[282:30.97]What's it going to be?
[282:32.03]Any bets in the chats?
[282:35.48]Or he just runs away and never comes back.
[282:38.28]And then he, in a day, takes a picture and uploads it of him at the stadium.
[282:44.52]That would be... Can you imagine?
[282:48.19]And he's wearing the same thing and he's tired.
[282:50.89]Oh, a hat.
[282:53.48]A baseball hat.
[282:54.50]Okay, a lot of people are saying baseball hats.
[282:56.34]The gamble is up, folks.
[282:58.94]The gamble is up.
[282:59.75]Baseball hat.
[283:00.25]Somebody said a plushie.
[283:01.53]A plushie, a jersey.
[283:02.99]What's it going to be?
[283:05.12]A ball.
[283:07.52]A ball.
[283:09.31]He's gonna bring a dice?
[283:10.39]He's not gonna bring a hot dog.
[283:12.17]That would be insane if he just is holding a hot dog and is like, I bought this hot dog back when I saw the game.
[283:23.74]H-O-T-D-O-G-O.
[283:33.48]He's bringing his A game.
[283:35.38]Wow, that's nice.
[283:38.26]A bat.
[283:41.10]Okay, like where, what is he, in a mansion?
[283:46.25]Is he looking for it?
[283:48.27]Oh, there we go.
[283:48.61]I wonder if they can see this.
[283:54.35]Isn't that cool?
[283:55.74]Wait, no, no, no, show it again.
[283:57.96]It's a poker chip?
[283:59.36]Oh, for the gamblers.
[284:02.04]Can you see?
[284:03.16]Yeah, I can.
[284:04.30]Isn't that the coolest logo you've ever seen in your life?
[284:07.43]Oh, yeah, I see the hat.
[284:08.55]Wait, that's actually really sick.
[284:10.35]Yeah.
[284:12.37]Wait, it's so nice.
[284:13.37]I got a hat.
[284:14.13]I got a shirt like this, but they had these little poker chips too.
[284:16.90]It's sick.
[284:18.12]Wait, what's the resale value?
[284:20.26]Priceless.
[284:20.66]I ain't gonna sell it.
[284:22.96]Don't you ever wonder?
[284:26.75]No, I don't even look it up.
[284:27.57]It's priceless.
[284:29.71]I'm just wondering, what is it?
[284:31.43]It's like a million dollars.
[284:33.58]You wouldn't sell it?
[284:34.50]No, it's priceless.
[284:35.16]What do I do with my other Wiimote?
[284:40.73]Where's my Wiimote?
[284:43.44]Oh, no.
[284:45.32]Oh, you tricked me.
[284:46.78]You tricked me.
[284:48.14]I trusted you.
[284:49.37]Did I pitch?
[284:51.89]You did.
[284:52.19]I got it.
[284:52.91]I got it.
[284:53.15]I got it.
[284:53.37]Okay, that's how you want to play.
[284:58.48]Okay.
[284:58.80]No, I'll remember it.
[284:59.58]I thought we were just going to do a friendly baseball game.
[285:02.08]Just like the gamblers.
[285:04.65]Should I read this one?
[285:06.17]Should I read this one?
[285:08.13]Yeah, 100%.
[285:09.03]Somebody said, I could cook a steak in your hair grease.
[285:12.65]Jesus Christ.
[285:14.95]But you don't want to over oil your stage.
[285:17.25]Hold on.
[285:17.65]What are they talking about?
[285:18.88]My hair is fine.
[285:23.40]I mean, yeah, it's a little.
[285:24.70]I mean, alright.
[285:26.20]Jeremiah, you're lucky you got your hair.
[285:27.90]I over.
[285:28.97]Oh, what do you know about that?
[285:30.59]Hey, that person that just said that.
[285:32.73]Look at this.
[285:33.17]And I can pull it.
[285:34.57]I can rip it.
[285:37.03]Don't don't.
[285:38.94]Wait a minute.
[285:39.46]What are you doing?
[285:40.26]Don't rip your hair.
[285:41.24]Wait a minute.
[285:41.78]What's going on here?
[285:43.77]Wait a minute.
[285:46.59]Oh no.
[285:47.37]What the fuck is that?
[285:49.07]No, is this your moment where you realize?
[285:54.88]Ban that person for a month.
[285:58.97]Oh no.
[286:00.84]I remember my moment, Jerma.
[286:02.08]I was at a Target self-checkout machine when it had a security camera up top.
[286:05.85]And I said, who the fuck is that guy?
[286:07.59]And then I look up and it's me.
[286:09.79]Oh, no.
[286:11.19]I know.
[286:11.57]It was brutal.
[286:12.30]I was like, what the fuck?
[286:13.38]Unlucky hair from that guy.
[286:14.86]And then I swear to God that happened.
[286:16.80]Well, I didn't.
[286:17.30]Yeah, I didn't.
[286:18.08]I didn't wash my hair today.
[286:19.38]I'm trying to do a thing where I wash it every other day.
[286:22.69]It's better for you.
[286:23.77]I got long hair now.
[286:24.87]You got to be aware of this.
[286:28.23]Did you practice this game?
[286:30.14]I didn't even know what I, I don't even know what I just did.
[286:32.96]Last time we had, we struggled to hit it for like three games straight.
[286:35.97]I've been looking over at the chat.
[286:38.61]I think like two thirds of the time we've been in the last few years.
[286:43.72]Oh, thank God.
[286:45.76]Yeah, me too.
[286:47.67]Boom.
[286:47.79]Okay.
[286:51.89]This game is so hard.
[286:56.40]Oh, let's go.
[286:58.60]And he said, get a haircut.
[287:01.50]I'll get a haircut when I decide I'm going to get a haircut.
[287:04.73]Yeah, he's not going to like do Twitch plays person.
[287:07.45]He's going to decide himself.
[287:11.31]Thank you.
[287:12.52]You're welcome.
[287:13.26]I got your back.
[287:17.14]Oh, what?
[287:19.22]Yeah, unfortunately, God gives me a haircut every other day.
[287:24.91]Yeah, I'm definitely thinning a little.
[287:26.46]I'm definitely thinning here.
[287:29.24]Like in the temples.
[287:31.26]That's me.
[287:32.20]They like right here.
[287:34.64]You're not thinning.
[287:35.90]You're going to have your hair forever.
[287:37.83]I will have it like this for at least the next 10 years.
[287:39.71]And by the way, 40.
[287:40.31]4-0.
[287:40.57]I'm fine with that.
[287:42.71]That's pretty good.
[287:43.77]I'm totally fine with the way it is right now.
[287:46.29]See, I have a hot take and everyone's going to write copium or plus 2 or whatever.
[287:50.72]But I think balding looks good.
[287:52.86]Remember Walton Goggins?
[287:55.09]from White Lotus?
[287:56.21]Like, I think it's a new trendy thing.
[287:58.79]I think it looks good.
[288:00.37]I think it looks fine.
[288:01.41]I think you can make it work.
[288:02.27]I think a lot of looks work with a bald or balding head.
[288:06.16]You can pull off a lot of shit with the hairline, wherever it is.
[288:10.38]It don't matter.
[288:10.92]Copium, that's fine.
[288:12.54]You can all say it.
[288:13.69]Cope, cope.
[288:14.41]Look at the copium.
[288:15.85]See?
[288:17.65]You just got a double cheeseburger.
[288:19.45]Let's freaking go.
[288:24.35]All the balls are saying, I agree, by the way.
[288:29.11]So I know everyone's like in the chat.
[288:31.38]I have a couple of chatters like, you know what?
[288:33.16]He's right.
[288:34.22]I know.
[288:36.72]It's cool.
[288:37.38]No, it looks good.
[288:40.15]Ah, God, it's so hard to get perfectly perfectly timed hit.
[288:45.79]Oh, I feel really is so hard.
[288:48.06]I fucked up big time.
[288:51.58]I see.
[288:52.10]I feel like we need just one point.
[288:54.55]That's kind of how this one works.
[288:59.90]Wasn't there another game like this?
[289:01.54]I haven't thrown any change-ups or anything at you like that.
[289:05.47]You can't say that while you're throwing a change-up.
[289:09.52]Wasn't there another tabletop game like this?
[289:11.66]Yeah, I remember.
[289:13.90]Here we go.
[289:14.16]I'm just going to do one right down the middle.
[289:20.41]This one's infuriating.
[289:23.24]Okay, now because I did that, I'm going to make it go a little slower.
[289:27.23]That was faster.
[289:30.26]You don't want to trust your opponents.
[289:32.79]I think that's not even the fastest it goes.
[289:44.40]Man, pitching in this game is so fun.
[289:46.61]I feel like the lag between my game, the milliseconds from the Joy-Con to the Switch is too long to even be able to hit these.
[289:56.39]Yeah, you for sure lost your Nintendo sponsor now.
[289:59.10]That was a nail in the coffin.
[290:03.02]Whatever.
[290:04.68]Ooh, there we go.
[290:06.32]Alright, not too bad.
[290:07.40]Somebody said, why do I even have hair?
[290:10.27]I'm happy with the hair the way it is.
[290:12.03]It's healthy.
[290:12.65]It's strong.
[290:14.31]It's receding a little, but I'm 40.
[290:17.11]What shampoo and all do you use?
[290:18.41]Like, what's your daily routine?
[290:19.79]I do the Maui.
[290:21.18]Maui coconut shampoo and conditioner.
[290:24.12]Uh-huh.
[290:25.08]Good.
[290:25.88]I used to use Lush for a lot of stuff, but I haven't really been keeping up on that.
[290:31.75]Lush.
[290:32.51]You remember the L'Oreal fish shampoo that everyone used to use?
[290:37.39]No, what was it?
[290:38.55]It'd be shaped like a fish and it'd make your hair smell like extremely strong fruits.
[290:45.42]Some people still have it.
[290:46.46]It'd be like watermelon flavor.
[290:48.39]Not flavor.
[290:50.21]Dude.
[290:51.99]Oh, yeah.
[290:53.05]Don't do that with... Why did I do that?
[290:58.56]I held that high enough.
[291:00.22]That was high enough, right?
[291:02.93]Oh, yeah.
[291:03.69]I fucked up, dude.
[291:04.81]It's alright.
[291:09.28]okay it goes down smooth would you what do you think your what would you say your favorite scents are like top two top three favorite scents oh easy lavender is number one okay good answer lavender is great and then I like um I like like a musky like candle like a leathery um like a like a like leather like the leather scents you go into like a leather store
[291:34.55]I've had my earbud backwards in this entire time.
[291:38.67]Can you guys see that?
[291:42.16]You're kidding.
[291:42.84]This is the left ear and my right side.
[291:46.53]Wait, no wonder you're completely thrown off.
[291:52.68]What the fuck?
[291:52.98]What happened?
[291:54.16]Wait, can you hear me now?
[291:54.76]Is that serious?
[291:58.04]No wonder I couldn't hear when you were yelling from the other side.
[292:02.95]no right wait what you can only hear me through one earbud this whole time I actually only do one earbud a lot of times I hate the closed off feeling of two earbuds in oh yeah we talked about this I did too but then the stream can hear the volume
[292:22.69]I think I fixed it.
[292:24.41]So you should let everything sound good.
[292:26.08]I think we're good.
[292:26.52]Yeah.
[292:27.30]You said, you know, like leather, like the, you go into like a boot store or something.
[292:32.59]I like that.
[292:33.29]And then I also like the smell of gasoline.
[292:36.26]Okay.
[292:37.78]would say probably I would say don't smell uh that too much of that but um okay oh but it's I smell so good what I used to do when I was a kid though that was scent related was I take those like uh markers that would be scented and draw in my uh nose so that I can always smell like the good scented markers every single day so you were burning a cd bringing it into school selling it a burnt like PlayStation 1 game yeah
[293:06.53]and then just, like, sniffing markers.
[293:09.88]Yeah, well, I didn't realize, like, that was probably... Well, I got held back, too, so, I mean... I don't know if that was related.
[293:18.54]I used to get in trouble with school all the time because I was just annoying.
[293:22.21]Oh yeah?
[293:23.13]I would just like, I would just want to tell jokes and be like, I was talking and I was all, I was just so awful.
[293:31.48]I was like such a, I was such a problem.
[293:34.21]Unbehaved, but my behavior was fine.
[293:36.41]I didn't do anything bad.
[293:38.03]Like what, what was your age when you were a problem at like a problem child?
[293:43.06]I would say between like 12 and 17, like 12 to 16.
[293:48.89]Yeah.
[293:50.88]so you get in trouble for that purpose I I would always trouble me detention yeah that's in boxes I think I don't think I'm making this up I'm pretty sure I either came close to or broke the record for coming to school late no yeah what were you doing in the morning like that's not a joke what 6 30 dude it sucked I hated it and like driving to school and
[294:20.43]So you're just like, we're sleeping.
[294:22.45]Yeah.
[294:23.07]You know how many Saturday detentions I had to do?
[294:26.39]No, that sucks.
[294:27.25]It sucked ass.
[294:28.48]I had Saturday detention all the time.
[294:32.74]Yeah, that's really depressing.
[294:34.06]Then you don't have no weekend.
[294:35.46]You go to do one thing on Saturday, it's over.
[294:39.39]Yeah.
[294:39.87]The Switch is frozen, by the way.
[294:41.33]Why is it doing this to us?
[294:42.21]It didn't do this to us last time.
[294:44.59]Yeah, I don't know.
[294:45.37]I'm on the Switch too.
[294:46.16]You think that doesn't help?
[294:47.96]Maybe you're using all the bandwidth.
[294:50.45]could be uh no in school Jerma I was um would you believe me if I said I was a popular kid I won homecoming king seriously yeah it's the best year of homeschooling in my life no I didn't win
[295:11.05]have to give it to him it wasn't like it wasn't like a like a hallmark movie or anything no I won I won homecoming king though I just wanted to brag um but I didn't get detention so did you were you never getting detention no I I did get it once I was always a trouble in school I was always always I just like always just I could never stop around
[295:35.44]Wait, so, okay, so you're just fucking around and you were late.
[295:38.70]Like, what were you just chit-chatting?
[295:39.94]And they're like, stop talking.
[295:41.20]And then you didn't stop talking.
[295:43.75]Yeah, I was kind of, I was one of those little shits.
[295:46.83]That is, I mean, I would talk all the time too.
[295:52.54]I did.
[295:53.02]Okay, once I was told, once after two times, after like one or two, it's like, alright, I got to stop.
[295:57.28]And let's pay attention now.
[295:59.17]Yeah, yeah, you have to.
[296:00.17]Otherwise you're, then you're just an ass.
[296:04.12]Like if you were like knowingly and you're like, fuck you teacher or whatever, like that's rude.
[296:09.07]No, no.
[296:09.72]Like I said, I was, my behavior was always fine, but I was always just messing around.
[296:15.75]They're fine.
[296:16.21]Yeah.
[296:16.49]I got like B minuses, C pluses.
[296:20.11]That's not good grades, but it's fine.
[296:23.65]I mean, it's better than me.
[296:25.64]I did not get B minuses or C pluses.
[296:28.79]So your GPA was like 2.5?
[296:29.99]2.4, I think, is what my official GPA was.
[296:36.83]I remember one semester, my GPA was 1.6.
[296:42.20]And then I had a math teacher talk to me and he was like, you got so much potential, kid.
[296:47.16]I'll tell you, I think everybody has one semester where they do really bad.
[296:53.93]I failed almost every class one semester.
[296:56.34]I got almost straight Fs.
[296:58.56]were they hard classes or were you just like particularly slacking?
[297:01.93]I just was, I was a total slack year.
[297:03.91]I just didn't care about anything.
[297:05.94]That's how I was.
[297:07.54]Yeah.
[297:07.66]Yeah.
[297:07.78]I mean, that's okay.
[297:08.70]Then you get one free slack year.
[297:11.16]Yeah.
[297:11.58]I really do feel like everybody, everybody gets one.
[297:13.61]Everybody gets one.
[297:15.25]Yeah.
[297:15.61]So choose your slack year.
[297:17.03]Uh, like choose it wisely.
[297:20.06]Like maybe when Donkey Kong Bonanza comes out, that's a great time.
[297:23.78]Somebody said that's me every year.
[297:26.53]You can't do it every year.
[297:29.07]You get one semester where you kind of... We can do it every year.
[297:32.55]Every year?
[297:32.89]That's not good.
[297:35.23]That's fine.
[297:36.87]They'll recover at some point.
[297:39.38]Every year is a little... Every year is a little much.
[297:42.88]Is it true you were a teacher?
[297:45.86]We were both teachers.
[297:48.42]I mean, I was a substitute for a little while.
[297:51.01]I wasn't a real... I wasn't like a teacher.
[297:53.87]Yeah, but if you have a classroom, that's a teacher.
[297:56.65]If you have to deal with children, you're a legit teacher.
[298:01.33]I sense it.
[298:02.09]I get it.
[298:02.69]I get teacher vibes from you.
[298:03.92]The students would come up to me and ask me questions about math stuff on the worksheet, and I just didn't even know what I didn't know.
[298:09.98]And that's the most humiliating, awful experience.
[298:13.31]Would you just shrug?
[298:15.01]I would try so hard to just bullshit my way around telling them to wait for the teacher.
[298:22.18]And to be like, oh, yeah, let me take a look at that.
[298:24.22]Let me take a look at that.
[298:24.92]This problem here, number 12 is the issue for you.
[298:26.91]Wait, what grade were you in seventh grade?
[298:31.11]Oh, this is like, dude, people are going to laugh.
[298:37.16]This is like sixth, seventh, and eighth grade.
[298:43.83]wait so they're like asking you for like um this wasn't like high school math man this was like this was like seventh grade shit it's hard like dividing like would you be able to do long division on paper right now
[298:59.15]I probably could up to a point.
[299:00.81]And then at one point I probably would be like, I don't do the hard drive.
[299:03.78]Remember I told you long division, everyone's doing a mega loss.
[299:06.48]It's fine.
[299:07.38]Um, the hard drive just starts writing over everything.
[299:11.51]And it gets to a point where you just, that gets all gone.
[299:13.61]I don't know long division anymore.
[299:14.97]I haven't been in a classroom in 20 years.
[299:18.22]Yeah.
[299:18.36]Like, which not your fault.
[299:19.52]Like you haven't practiced.
[299:21.12]it just happens over time it'd be you know what it'd be strange if you knew every it'd be strange if you're like weirdly good at division I would say I guess you just kind of internalize it no but for life there's no way someone internalizes what they learned in school forever I gotta I gotta stop looking at chat and actually play the video game I'm just getting I'm sneaking free wins here you killed me I I didn't realize we even played one game this is the second game
[299:52.22]Yeah, my YouTube title is going to be How I Destroyed Jerma.
[299:56.27]And then I'll have that thumbnail that we made with me holding you.
[300:00.58]Dude, this has been kind of like a three thumbnail.
[300:03.10]As the kids would say, this has been like a yap stream.
[300:06.70]I feel like this has been like a podcast.
[300:09.23]This is great.
[300:10.63]It's awesome.
[300:11.59]That's why we got to do these every Sunday once in a while.
[300:15.58]Yeah, every Sunday, every three months, every Sunday.
[300:19.73]and then send 10 games to each other, play like four, and then be upset about a Mario game.
[300:25.78]I think that's the tradition.
[300:26.92]Oh my God, you just ricocheted me.
[300:29.86]Let's freaking go.
[300:31.10]Let's do this one again.
[300:33.06]I like tanks.
[300:34.50]This one's fun, yeah.
[300:36.29]Is there another map?
[300:37.63]I feel like we haven't played that before.
[300:38.97]Oh, someone made a thing.
[300:45.17]Here, I'll send it to you in Discord.
[300:47.03]What do they got?
[300:51.79]There you go.
[300:56.24]I love the best part about this is they didn't even use the image that I made.
[301:00.89]They used a green screen one.
[301:03.99]It wasn't up to their standards apparently.
[301:06.25]They're very picky.
[301:08.16]There's something very odd about this picture.
[301:22.18]There's something very ominous about this.
[301:24.41]Yeah, it's my face.
[301:25.85]No, no, no.
[301:26.27]I think it's the combination of your face and me with this weird... I have no expression.
[301:31.58]I'm... Yeah, it's a weird energy.
[301:35.67]There's a very, very weird energy with this picture.
[301:38.77]And I'm holding you all weird.
[301:40.49]It's all very strange.
[301:44.20]And what is the story?
[301:45.80]Why am I so excited and why do you seem so... Like...
[301:50.77]okay like you're not mad what are these chat messages hey if you're gonna use this in your thumbnail are you gonna use this in your thumbnail can you use this one yeah for sure those chat messages are crazy oh wait you're right I didn't even read I did I was like
[302:15.26]How is that allowed in my chat?
[302:16.78]Are the mods here?
[302:18.60]Like, ban that guy.
[302:20.73]Is that guy still around?
[302:21.79]How did that sneak in?
[302:26.50]That needs to stay in then.
[302:28.70]With my face, it looks crazy.
[302:32.91]With that face, it's insane.
[302:37.13]How is that not auto-lauded?
[302:40.45]Oh, that's funny.
[302:41.83]And the fact that they got, they snuck that in there while you were taking... They knew what they were doing.
[302:45.72]They knew exactly what they were doing.
[302:47.22]They knew.
[302:49.56]They knew.
[302:50.00]Man, I didn't even see that.
[302:51.27]That's how much I ignore the chat.
[302:54.89]Dude, I forget you could even ricochet.
[302:57.45]You were talking about how I was beating you in all the games.
[302:59.04]You've been smoking me.
[303:01.40]It's like, have you ever played the game Gunbound?
[303:04.65]Oh, shit.
[303:05.19]Dude, your Switch 2 is eating up all the bandwidth.
[303:09.50]You've got to get the new Switch.
[303:11.08]You're hogging all the VRAM.
[303:15.65]Yeah, I'm on freaking DSL.
[303:17.75]What, are you still on dial-up?
[303:22.44]Oh, my God.
[303:23.28]Get with the times.
[303:25.90]Oh, shit.
[303:26.52]How did that hit me?
[303:30.69]It just kicked.
[303:32.31]Okay, I'm gonna go sneak attack.
[303:34.01]You'll never see me coming from this way.
[303:37.29]There should be fog of war in this game.
[303:39.10]Back to the drawing board, Nintendo.
[303:41.70]Why is there no fog of war?
[303:42.36]Yeah, even though Nintendo didn't make this game.
[303:45.16]Oh, here we go.
[303:45.62]Slow-mo.
[303:48.59]Wow, that was... I had chills.
[303:51.07]Is it stuck on that explosion?
[303:54.25]It actually is having trouble rendering the explosion.
[303:59.08]It's a cinematic masterpiece.
[304:00.50]I'm rumbling.
[304:02.14]Wait, is my... Is my mom on the phone?
[304:08.17]Does that slow it down?
[304:09.83]I remember playing Man Conquer Red Alert and telling everybody in the house, guys, please don't pick up the phone.
[304:17.64]Don't answer the phone.
[304:18.47]Don't talk to anybody.
[304:19.93]Because that got serious.
[304:21.17]That was a competitive game.
[304:23.91]Yeah, no, I get it.
[304:24.89]And then still, no matter what, at the worst possible time, the phone.
[304:29.32]You pick up the phone and the internet drops.
[304:31.60]Mm-hmm.
[304:32.70]Yeah, I still remember that.
[304:34.33]I used to play that.
[304:35.47]I used to play StarCraft and RollerCoaster Tycoon exclusively.
[304:39.62]Oh, RollerCoaster Tycoon is such a great game.
[304:41.46]Apparently, we might actually get through this.
[304:43.34]It's still going.
[304:46.87]Slow-mo.
[304:48.11]Surely we don't disconnect now.
[304:53.16]Oh, has it been frozen for a long time for you?
[304:55.36]Yeah.
[304:56.24]Oh.
[304:59.42]Oh, communication error.
[305:02.28]Oh, man.
[305:04.12]You know what?
[305:04.46]We might have to switch Sundays to Steam Sundays.
[305:08.43]I know.
[305:08.83]Or I have to actually get a Switch 2.
[305:11.33]But I'm a retro gamer.
[305:13.51]Yeah, I know.
[305:13.89]But there's still retro games on Steam.
[305:17.16]Dude.
[305:18.12]Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[305:19.74]What?
[305:20.04]Give or play... Give or play... Oh, God.
[305:24.31]What was... What was... The one I... Metal Slug.
[305:29.00]They have a Metal Slug collection.
[305:30.66]I'd play Metal Slug.
[305:31.44]That's a fun game.
[305:33.02]Those games are amazing.
[305:35.08]Alright, but do you want to try this again?
[305:36.89]I think that's a good Switch Sunday.
[305:41.49]I think that's a good stopping point too for Switch one day on a Wednesday.
[305:45.30]Yeah, there's a little bit of lag, but that's honest and true to the console.
[305:50.38]It's fun.
[305:50.76]I had a good time.
[305:51.30]We did a lot of fun stuff.
[305:52.84]It was a good time.
[305:53.90]Yeah, 100%.
[305:54.71]Next time we have so many more games that we have to get through.
[305:56.75]We do.
[305:58.45]We definitely should play the Ninja Turtle stuff that I feel like would go really hard.
[306:02.27]Metal Slug Collection on PS2 was good stuff.
[306:04.51]We'll definitely check it out.
[306:05.65]It's so good.
[306:06.97]I played Metal Slug recently and had a blast.
[306:09.22]I'm surprised how well that aged.
[306:12.84]Somebody's brought it up too that I want to play Red Alert with a whole group of people.
[306:18.18]I feel like it would be a lot of fun.
[306:19.53]Do a big 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 or something.
[306:22.87]You can have a lot of people on a map, can't you?
[306:25.05]Yeah, let's do it.
[306:25.99]I don't think I've played Red Alert before.
[306:28.47]It's so great.
[306:30.41]Is it like an RTS?
[306:31.67]Yeah.
[306:32.85]Yeah, yeah.
[306:33.31]Oh, I'd be super down.
[306:35.66]Endless Ocean is goaded, please.
[306:38.34]Okay, next time we have to do Endless Ocean.
[306:40.40]Endless Ocean, please.
[306:42.31]The Endless Ocean fans are going crazy.
[306:46.25]They're so disappointed today.
[306:48.14]You guys are great to sleep to.
[306:50.94]That's a huge compliment.
[306:52.08]That's how I watched Twitch.
