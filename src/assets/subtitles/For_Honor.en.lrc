[00:52.83]Man.
[01:00.52]I don't know, what the fuck am I doing?
[01:09.06]Hold on, I'm just making a tweet.
[01:10.13]Hold on, I'm just making a tweet.
[01:17.80]Hey, thank you, Sojin Yu, for the 11 months.
[01:20.46]And... Chaker.
[01:23.90]What?
[01:24.48]Triker.
[01:25.98]To save our Mother Earth from any alien attack from various vicious insects, EDF deploys.
[01:32.58]Thanks a lot, man.
[01:36.53]So, we're gonna play For Honor tonight.
[01:39.08]It was a different thing to do.
[01:41.14]I was gonna do a stream, uh, paint stream today.
[01:46.06]All kinds of fucking comedy bits and shit.
[01:47.90]You know, like, hey, I do those comedy bits sometimes.
[01:50.88]It was gonna be that, but decided that it needed a lot more prep time than I gave it credit for, so.
[02:00.53]That's gonna have to be for another time.
[02:03.04]But I want to make sure, is the mic, how's the mic level right now?
[02:06.64]Because I had to change it.
[02:08.64]Because I was upstairs a couple days ago with this microphone, so.
[02:13.46]How low is this mic?
[02:15.24]I wonder.
[02:15.92]It's probably pretty fucking low.
[02:17.52]Let me see what happens if I do this.
[02:19.30]Hold on.
[02:25.24]Okay, here we go.
[02:26.12]You tell me when it's too much to handle.
[02:29.62]Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.
[02:32.74]Hello?
[02:33.86]Hello?
[02:35.32]Hello?
[02:36.21]Alright, that just got, like, insane.
[02:37.65]I think that's better.
[02:39.39]Is that better or worse?
[02:41.31]Like, that got really loud for just one second.
[02:45.51]How's it now?
[02:46.45]Are we okay now?
[02:47.32]Or should I crank it up a little bit more?
[02:48.58]What do you guys think?
[02:54.18]Yeah, this is gonna be a real quality paint stream in the near future.
[03:06.99]Is it like a sword emoji?
[03:08.81]I don't know.
[03:14.05]Louder, louder, louder.
[03:15.13]Hold on, I need to make a tweet.
[03:17.89]It needs to be a sword.
[03:19.33]I'm going to write, Hiya.
[03:25.52]What's the closest thing to a weapon?
[03:27.40]This is a spoon here.
[03:33.32]How do you spell Hiya?
[03:34.42]Hiya.
[03:37.59]Is it H-I-Y-A?
[03:39.04]Like, hi-ya!
[03:39.68]But isn't that like, hi-ya?
[03:46.24]Like that.
[03:48.18]Yeah, okay.
[03:48.94]That looks good.
[03:54.51]One second.
[03:55.53]Let's just let this ride.
[04:00.53]Okay.
[04:03.11]Hi-ya!
[04:04.33]Yeah, that's how I was spelling it.
[04:08.07]Alright, here we go.
[04:10.47]I got the game ready to go right here.
[04:11.83]Let's hope my computer can handle this shit.
[04:17.03]And switch over here.
[04:19.51]There it is.
[04:21.56]I hope.
[04:23.30]Who even knows at this point.
[04:24.90]Can anybody see anything?
[04:29.52]Uh...
[04:32.14]I don't know what's going on with my game capture for OBS recently, but it hasn't been able to capture any games.
[04:37.95]I don't understand why.
[04:40.97]Well, okay then.
[04:41.83]We're going to have to just capture my fucking monitor.
[04:47.31]That's so annoying.
[04:49.55]I need OBS Studio.
[04:51.53]OBS Classic is kind of turning into a real piece of shit lately.
[05:00.44]That's not even the right window.
[05:06.37]What?
[05:10.91]This was working earlier.
[05:11.95]What the fuck is going on now?
[05:21.59]Well, guys, that seems to be an annoying start.
[05:26.72]Dude, I think my computer just sucks ass.
[05:29.74]What do you think?
[05:34.25]Why is it not even showing the game?
[05:35.47]What the fuck?
[05:37.79]I'm, like, clearly in this game right now.
[05:40.57]Oh my god.
[05:41.71]Oh, hey, look!
[05:42.57]Look, you can see my screen!
[05:43.71]Open, open.
[05:44.33]No, now you can't!
[05:45.73]Now you can't, because For Honor is open.
[05:53.95]Hold on.
[06:01.10]Am I gonna...
[06:03.31]I swear to God, Ubisoft.
[06:06.55]I'm gonna complain about you.
[06:07.79]Why can't I change my fucking screen resolution?
[06:12.51]What in the name of God?
[06:13.53]Oh my fucking lord.
[06:16.69]It's always an Ubisoft game.
[06:18.98]Always.
[06:20.72]Guys, guys, it's always an Ubisoft game.
[06:24.72]Always.
[06:30.20]Why can't I change my settings?
[06:38.35]Use borderless window.
[06:39.37]I can't even change it.
[06:45.71]My graphic settings are grayed out when I'm in the game.
[06:51.06]Always an Ubisoft game.
[06:52.18]Always.
[06:52.44]I already am annoyed with this game.
[07:05.78]Hold on.
[07:06.08]Here it comes.
[07:07.18]Close your ears.
[07:07.64]Close your ears.
[07:10.41]Just play Wild West Showdown.
[07:17.30]Just do it in real life.
[07:18.16]I would, if I could.
[07:19.28]Okay, well, here's that.
[07:30.28]Hey, look, you can see the screen.
[07:34.35]Window capture.
[07:41.04]Okay.
[07:43.68]Yeah.
[07:45.66]At least you can see it.
[07:49.60]They didn't make it easy for you, do they?
[07:56.01]Like, what a pain in the ass.
[07:57.17]Alright, welcome to the stream.
[08:01.89]Alright, so I did For Honor.
[08:07.47]Welcome to For Honor.
[08:09.45]We're gonna pick our, uh, our team here.
[08:16.02]There's another thing that I want to complain about.
[08:17.30]Alright, ready?
[08:18.92]Ready for this?
[08:19.50]Ready for me to complain?
[08:21.12]A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
[08:22.22]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[08:22.98]Here we go.
[08:25.30]Why... Why do games not let you change the graphic settings until you, like, get into the game?
[08:34.64]I've been noticing that a lot more recently.
[08:36.20]It's like, oh, hey, welcome to the game.
[08:37.76]The audio is blowing your fucking eardrums out.
[08:40.24]The game looks all fucked up, and you might not even be in the right resolution.
[08:43.52]But, hey, do you want to be a knight, or do you want to be a viking?
[08:45.95]Or do you want to be a samurai?
[08:48.05]Which one are they?
[08:48.57]Oh, pick a samurai.
[08:49.83]Oh, okay.
[08:50.21]Oh, did you hear that guy scream?
[08:53.83]Oh, wow.
[08:55.65]Like, can I please do my shit before I get into the game?
[08:58.65]What do you guys want me to do?
[09:07.71]Aren't there I&I files?
[09:08.80]Yeah, but you shouldn't have to do that.
[09:10.00]I should be able to do it like... This should be like a fucking menu.
[09:12.78]We're gonna be samurai.
[09:17.18]I'm gonna be samurai because I want to be the big fat guy.
[09:21.83]Do we find one we like?
[09:24.39]This one.
[09:25.01]No.
[09:28.73]That one.
[09:29.43]Yep.
[09:30.21]Definitely.
[09:32.14]This one's very zen.
[09:35.08]Yeah.
[09:41.94]It's gotta be like the Jerma colors though.
[09:43.38]That's important.
[09:47.00]I'm gonna be disappointed in this game.
[09:48.86]Am I really?
[09:50.18]Well, whatever.
[09:54.11]Alright.
[09:58.17]That's the worst possible one.
[10:00.53]Wait, the fat guy's not in the game yet?
[10:04.25]Awww.
[10:05.15]What?
[10:08.28]While this loads up, I want to say thank you to AntiThePsychoFeistl for five months.
[10:11.66]Straight Outta twitch.tv for two months.

[10:38.01]DarthButtCross, 14 months!
[10:40.81]But let's learn how to play this game.
[10:42.31]My WASD is moved, very obviously.
[10:45.85]I thought the game just crashed.
[10:46.81]Okay.
[10:47.85]Hold down left control to lock on it.
[10:49.95]Should I plug... Alright, first of all, before I get any further.
[10:52.41]Do I need to plug a controller in for this game?
[10:55.37]Should I just go get my fucking PS4 controller?
[10:58.69]Yeah.
[10:59.75]Okay.
[11:00.27]So, everybody hold on.
[11:01.72]I'm gonna plug in my fucking Xbox controller or something.
[11:06.34]Where's my plug?
[11:06.72]Yeah, alright.
[11:07.04]No, we're doing controller.
[11:14.95]Dude with a Wiimote.
[11:15.75]Alright, give me a second.
[11:17.63]Hey, hey, starting soon!
[11:18.71]You can't even see my, like, T. What the fuck?
[11:22.66]Here we go.
[11:22.98]Alright, I'll be right back.
[11:23.90]I'm just gonna get the controller.
[11:25.62]Because I feel like if I don't have a controller, I might not enjoy this.
[11:28.50]Be right back.
[11:29.84]Wait, what?
[11:39.97]Beer.
[11:59.24]Wait...
[11:59.96]WHAT?! !
[12:29.75]Did somebody say just plug in the Wonder Book?
[12:34.73]Just plug the Wonder Book in, you fucking dummy.
[12:39.84]You guys are going to hear the window sound.
[12:41.14]Hold on.
[12:41.92]Wait, what?
[12:46.74]Here comes that wonderful window sound.
[12:50.52]It's going to go.
[12:51.04]Wait, what?
[12:55.87]Okay, okay.
[12:58.84]Alright, here we go.
[12:59.96]And it automatically detected it.
[13:01.36]Great.
[13:01.82]Good.
[13:02.60]Wonderful.
[13:03.12]Fantastic.
[13:05.32]L2 to lock on to target in guard mode.
[13:07.22]Okay.
[13:12.59]Okay.
[13:16.69]Guard mode, L2.
[13:19.93]Quickly release L2, then hold L2.
[13:21.55]Okay.
[13:21.89]Okay.
[13:30.19]So when you release L2, that's just who you want to target.
[13:33.21]Okay?
[13:33.73]Get it?
[13:36.01]Guard mode.
[13:36.57]Guarding determines the direction of your attacks and blocks.
[13:39.05]L2.
[13:39.41]Next!
[13:39.85]I'm playing a different game.
[13:40.59]I'm done.
[13:40.89]No, I'm just kidding.
[13:42.01]Guarding determines the direction of your attacks and blocks.
[13:44.13]L2 to guard.
[13:45.16]R to change.
[13:45.98]Got it.
[13:46.82]So, I can like... Go that way.
[13:56.24]Oh, boy.
[13:56.86]This is going to be a game.
[13:58.84]This is going to be a game.
[14:05.41]Hold is out of guard mode?
[14:08.85]Stop practicing hold circle out of guard mode.
[14:10.61]Okay.
[14:11.75]Keep practicing stances.
[14:16.59]Alright.
[14:16.85]Seems easy enough.
[14:17.41]And I mean that in the most non-active... Right.
[14:23.60]This is...
[14:26.70]Alright, new mission objective.
[14:27.72]To block, match the direction of the attack.
[14:30.16]Oh god, this is gonna be like that old Star Wars, Darth Vader game.
[14:32.48]Remember?
[14:34.68]In the arcades.
[14:37.10]Oh shit.
[14:39.58]You're gonna make me do the Star Wars arcade game.
[14:41.97]Aren't you?
[14:44.79]Oh.
[14:45.55]Nice.
[14:47.87]Cool.
[14:51.49]Just gotta match the direction.
[14:52.75]I'm gonna assume it's not gonna do that when it's a player.
[14:55.31]You have to, like, actually learn this shit.
[14:57.24]This is very loud, by the way, if I turn it down.
[15:03.22]Blocking the attacks.
[15:06.42]Oh, whoops.
[15:07.54]Is there a reason why this is letterboxed?
[15:16.14]Does this not be letterboxed?
[15:19.91]Am I going to play Overwatch or Star tomorrow?
[15:21.71]I think so.
[15:29.22]Attack where the enemy is not guarding.
[15:31.22]R1 for a light attack, R2 for heavy attack.
[15:34.56]Okay.
[15:36.36]Wow, Ubisoft, you really did rip off like fucking Star Wars.
[15:42.10]Okay, so he's blocking up.
[15:47.06]You don't want to swing up.
[15:47.88]You want to swing left.
[15:51.02]Cool.
[15:53.42]Defeat with light attack.
[15:54.46]Do I have like a stamina bar?
[16:01.23]Just R2 every time.
[16:02.73]Uh-oh.
[16:05.35]Here comes the leader.
[16:06.33]Interesting.
[16:10.21]Cool.
[16:19.40]Am I sober?
[16:20.08]Yeah, I'm sober.
[16:21.28]Dude, me and like Kim just got like shit-faced.
[16:25.05]That was a drunk stream.
[16:31.91]Oh, he like switched in the right time.
[16:35.94]Can you string like both together?
[16:41.22]Can I do, like, for instance, like... L1, like... Alright, that was a combo.
[16:47.06]Got it.
[16:48.65]The game is loud.
[16:49.35]Yeah, I'll turn it down.
[16:51.75]Hold on.
[16:57.19]That should help.
[16:57.65]Okay, keep practicing.
[17:00.67]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:05.83]Check the moveset at any time.
[17:08.69]Capture zone A. Let's take a look at the moveset.
[17:13.67]Dawn of Steel.
[17:14.37]R1, R1, R1.
[17:17.29]R1, R1, R2.
[17:18.51]R1, R2, R2.
[17:19.39]Whatever.
[17:21.79]Let's just go.
[17:26.19]L3 is sprint.
[17:27.51]Yep.
[17:30.02]That was easy.
[17:34.22]Kill all enemies in a capture zone and keep an enemy free for a few seconds to control it.
[17:37.28]Easy enough.
[17:49.90]Anymore?
[17:50.24]I feel like this is gonna be fun.
[18:01.11]Ooh, now this is a battle.
[18:02.66]This is what I'm talking about.
[18:05.83]This is what I'm talking about.
[18:08.23]Look, I know.
[18:09.13]I wanted to just fucking run in there.
[18:11.48]Soldiers can't be locked on.
[18:12.82]Release L2, then R1 or R2 to kill them.
[18:16.46]So you can't lock on to these random dudes.
[18:18.28]You just have to smash them.
[18:21.90]Oh, wow.
[18:24.86]Can I still block, though?
[18:26.02]I mean, I shouldn't... Kill enemies to help your soldiers push the front.
[18:30.19]Okay.
[18:33.29]I guess I can't really block these guys.
[18:39.12]Just in the way.
[18:39.82]I just killed like five people in one swing.
[18:45.07]Is this Dynasty Warriors or is this for honor?
[18:47.61]Are you serious?
[18:50.34]How did this baseball smoke and kill the whole baseball team?
[19:03.17]You guys suck these guys are just here to die Like legitimately these dudes are just these guys have brains I Don't think anybody here has a brain.
[19:20.44]These are meat people They're only designed to just get hit by a sword okay, then I'm trying to block I
[19:32.30]This is not historically accurate.
[19:38.05]I did it!
[19:38.97]I beat the game.
[19:41.95]Oh that- look at that guy swung at me.
[19:51.81]That guy actually took a swim to me and hit me right in the back.
[19:54.31]Doesn't even matter.
[19:56.63]Alright, reach zone C. I'm done- I just killed like fucking 75 people.
[20:00.39]Let's just go to C.
[20:06.04]That's so satisfying.
[20:09.02]Next.
[20:09.34]No, I need to play against real humans.
[20:14.68]Time your dodge to avoid attacks.
[20:16.00]There's a dodge roll in this game?

[22:54.58]Yeah, let's go.
[22:55.02]Okay, I've tried to fight the commander.
[22:58.14]Error.
[22:58.90]An error has occurred.

[24:11.29]Okay, here we go.
[24:12.41]What do we do?
[24:13.01]I can't move.
[24:32.27]Why can I not move?
[24:33.77]Oh.
[24:34.41]Okay.
[24:34.77]Alright.
[24:36.29]Let's do it.
[24:37.85]Time for me to prove that I'm gonna be the number one For Honor stream on twitch.tv.
[24:41.87]You guys will be talking about this, like, this game's gonna blow the fuck up and be huge.
[24:45.27]And it's like, oh, remember when, like, Jeremy first did that tutorial?
[24:48.81]Remember when Jeremy, like, did this?
[24:50.79]Man, he's like the piece of For Honor stream that I watch.
[24:56.95]Yeah, he's got like 30,000 concurrent viewers.
[24:59.14]Oh, there's a guy.
[25:02.30]There's a guy.
[25:05.12]Oh, did you guys remember when fucking Jerma did that on stream?
[25:09.76]Oh shit, that's a... That's a teammate.
[25:13.50]Did you guys remember when Jerma did that shit on stream that time?
[25:17.31]What?
[25:19.39]How did we lose?
[25:20.23]Wait, this is a bad guy.
[25:25.60]Got to remember my fucking training.
[25:26.94]Got to remember my fucking training.
[25:38.51]Where's my fucking friends?
[25:45.13]How come it's just me versus these two?
[25:47.02]Revenge.
[25:55.00]I just got, like, 2v1'd.
[26:02.85]What the fuck?
[26:03.59]Alright, well, let's go.
[26:11.48]They abandoned you.
[26:16.18]I guess I have to do the advanced tutorial, huh?
[26:27.59]Oh my god, I'm getting so badly beat that I have no idea what's even going on.
[26:36.89]I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[26:46.72]Like what am I supposed to even be doing?
[26:50.68]There's just people, there's just fucking a bunch of enemies running into each other.
[26:59.42]Like, is there anywhere else I should be going?
[27:01.12]Like, this is the only place to go.
[27:03.18]I'm going with my fucking buddy.
[27:05.06]I'm not gonna go alone anymore.
[27:10.75]Why do I feel like there's nobody else on the team?
[27:12.21]There's, like, me and this guy.
[27:15.23]Like, look, there's, like, blue people everywhere.
[27:17.19]Alright, here we go.
[27:23.93]No, it's not fair.
[27:24.59]It's not fucking fair!
[27:25.80]What the fuck?
[27:27.34]Dude, that's... Where the fuck is everybody?
[27:30.66]Where the f- There's five people here.
[27:32.30]I'm the only person fucking sitting here.
[27:34.40]What the fuck is going on?
[27:38.68]What's going on?
[27:39.40]Why are the fucking- Why are we only- What?
[27:47.87]What the fuck?
[27:49.69]You lost Zone A.
[27:54.90]Alright, I think I see two teammates.
[27:56.98]Alright, can we please be together?
[27:58.70]Alright, I think you can execute, apparently, too.
[28:20.15]Got him!
[28:21.07]Execute him!
[28:23.51]What did that guy just do?
[28:36.01]Off with his head.
[28:37.05]Okay, I'm actually figuring this out.
[28:42.76]You just gotta get a little more confidence.
[28:44.90]You just gotta build some confidence by killing all the little tiny shitty foot soldiers with red t-shirts on.
[28:51.66]We didn't have enough money to afford you guys wearing armor.
[28:54.09]You guys just wear like a team uniform.
[28:57.39]These guys don't even look like they belong in this age.
[29:01.57]Alright, let's go.
[29:03.17]Nope, I got a guy right here.
[29:07.79]I'm gonna fucking surprise this dude.
[29:09.69]Right up the stairs.
[29:11.41]Call off this guy.
[29:24.74]Okay, I'm like trying to, I'm like executing his friend.
[29:26.58]The fuck do you think you're doing?
[29:32.60]What the fuck?
[29:33.72]I blocked it.
[29:34.18]I like, I blocked that attack.
[29:35.26]1v1v1.
[29:35.40]That wasn't a 1v1, that was a 1v2 and I got his friend.
[29:56.77]I just team killed?
[29:57.57]What are you talking about?
[30:01.37]Wait, I killed my friend?
[30:03.15]What?
[30:06.17]Hold on.
[30:07.29]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[30:08.87]I killed my own teammate?
[30:13.77]That can't be how it happened.
[30:15.53]That can't be how it happened.
[30:17.29]We're like, what?
[30:21.07]Why can I lock onto my fucking team?
[30:26.77]lost zone a I shouldn't be able to lock on to my team team kill it I seriously like I thought I was locked on to the guy alright we gotta be tactical about this
[30:49.34]Shit.
[30:49.50]They have a lot of guys here and he's running.
[30:50.94]Something wrong, buddy?
[30:53.32]Something wrong?
[30:55.44]No, and he's got fucking friends here.
[31:05.88]Too many of them.
[31:07.28]Too many.
[31:07.76]Too many dickheads.
[31:09.54]I need to go back to the team.
[31:20.93]We did it!
[31:24.40]And that's how we celebrate, boys!
[31:26.72]I fucking slaughter you all!
[31:32.98]That's not too bad.
[31:34.69]First time ever.
[31:41.03]Turn it down even more?
[31:42.31]Really?
[31:43.65]How's that?
[31:45.58]I'll turn it down.
[31:45.96]I can't.
[31:46.16]I'll turn it down.
[31:49.69]That was fairly fun when I figured out what was going on.
[31:55.85]You get loot in this game too?
[31:59.96]Wait, what?
[32:02.98]Level up?
[32:09.46]I guess we're... I'm going to go back and do the... How do I just get out of here?
[32:16.17]I don't want to next match this shit.
[32:17.63]Quit to world map.
[32:19.43]I'm gonna do the advanced tutorial.
[32:21.04]The Faction War is a persistent cross-platform conflict between the knights, vikings, and samurai.
[32:27.60]The faction you've pledged allegiance to determines who you'll fight for in the Faction War, but doesn't stop you from playing any available hero.
[32:35.27]Right.
[32:35.89]The Faction War englobes all multiplayer and bot activities.
[32:39.91]After each match, you will be awarded war assets based on your personal performance.
[32:45.08]You can deploy war assets to help conquer an enemy territory, or defend one of yours against opposing factions.
[32:52.53]On a global level, the faction war is divided into territory updates, rounds, and seasons.
[32:59.23]Territory updates occur every six hours, while rounds last two weeks, and seasons last ten weeks.
[33:06.05]I can't, I, I, I, I don't even, I don't care.
[33:13.06]They're like talking about... See, two weeks for the tactical taking over the duel and then going over this territory and using resources to invade that country.
[33:21.56]Look, I just want to hit people with a fucking sword.
[33:24.37]I want to just duel people.
[33:25.41]I don't want to do this fucking Europa Universal sales bullshit.
[33:32.89]I want to fight a guy.
[33:33.53]I don't want to play Crusader Kings.
[33:41.23]Oh, Star, you want to play?
[33:43.63]Okay.
[33:44.85]I'll play with you.
[33:48.24]I need... Hold on.
[33:52.32]Hold on.
[33:53.70]One sec.
[33:54.02]Just going to move some stuff around.
[33:59.66]I'm going to go in the TS, buddy.
[34:03.84]I'll see you in the TS.
[34:06.12]If you'd like to play.
[34:07.20]And you can teach me how to play.
[34:08.64]You can be my buddy.
[34:12.37]You can be my, for honor, buddy.
[34:16.03]Hey!
[34:16.51]Oh, I don't think he can even hear me.
[34:20.43]Hold on.
[34:24.98]Um, why?
[34:30.12]What the heck?
[34:34.40]Okay.
[34:35.36]Hey, what's going on?
[34:37.06]Hey, what's going on?
[34:38.62]Oh, you're very, I think I have to turn you down.
[34:42.77]Hey guys, it's Star.
[34:43.95]You guys remember this guy?
[34:45.39]Yeah.
[34:46.47]Have you guys ever heard him before?
[34:47.93]He's a YouTuber.
[34:52.45]He's a Twitch streamer.
[34:54.95]And he's a great friend of mine.
[34:57.49]Wow.
[34:58.19]It's sad because I feel like some people actually needed that explanation.
[35:01.99]They're like, wait, what?
[35:04.26]I've never heard of this guy.
[35:05.32]You guys ever play together?
[35:06.48]Who is this guy?
[35:09.16]Yeah, this is Ster.
[35:11.54]Have you been playing this game a lot?
[35:13.62]I played in the last beta.
[35:14.87]I haven't played open beta yet.
[35:19.19]It seems like pretty fun.
[35:22.35]When it works.
[35:23.79]But it doesn't work?
[35:26.87]Again, I haven't played the open beta, but closed beta had a lot of problems.
[35:29.83]Really?
[35:30.56]How do we party up?
[35:32.62]I have invited you.
[35:33.48]I think in-game you have to press Shift-F2.
[35:36.00]Shift-F2.
[35:38.88]I see... Uh...
[35:45.19]What is your name?
[35:47.65]Ikoto.
[35:48.83]Why is your name Ikoto?
[35:51.27]Long story.
[35:52.91]Well, I just accept it.
[35:53.81]Why are you Ikoto?
[35:56.46]A long time ago, I made an alias and I was talking to Mail at the time and he said, do what I did and just mash your keyboard.
[36:04.08]I was like, that's alright.
[36:05.94]And Ster is obviously taken on Uplay.
[36:08.20]Right.
[36:09.18]So it was around the same time when I first made a Uplay account.
[36:12.19]It doesn't matter.
[36:12.81]Why don't you just make your name like
[36:16.20]I'll change it later.
[36:17.32]Like, star the commando.
[36:19.62]Later.
[36:20.94]Alright.
[36:22.13]So, I only did the very basic tutorial.
[36:23.89]People said do advanced tutorial or I suck.
[36:26.67]Do you want me to show you things?
[36:28.83]Or do you want to just, like, go do a 2v2?
[36:30.93]Or do more Dominion?
[36:32.21]Let's do 1v1.
[36:32.77]You gotta be my senpai.
[36:33.73]No, sensei.
[36:34.15]What is it?
[36:34.63]Sensei.
[36:34.97]You gotta be my sensei.
[36:46.41]You want to be like the stream?
[36:48.69]I would love to be your sensei.
[36:50.19]Alright.
[36:50.71]That's going to be the stream.
[36:51.37]You're going to teach me how to be a fucking samurai warrior.
[36:59.07]Good, because I'm already best in the world.
[37:10.04]So what's the... What should I be playing as?
[37:12.72]Samurai or...
[37:14.98]knights like whatever you want what's like what have you played us so far just the regular the mustached guy who's I don't know who that is oh kensei uh he's a little bit weird they all they all got their
[37:30.82]Who out of the three that are available are like, you know, this one's like, it's pretty straightforward.
[37:36.42]It actually says straightforward.
[37:38.66]They're all available.
[37:39.63]You can actually play as any of them.
[37:41.03]I know, but I'm saying like, who's the most like straightforward?
[37:43.11]And I look at the screen and it says straightforward on this guy.
[37:51.09]Okay, we're going to go straightforward.
[37:53.05]Raider is probably the most straightforward.
[37:55.11]Warden I wouldn't recommend.
[37:56.53]No?
[37:56.83]Warden is not as straightforward as they would lead you to believe.
[38:00.96]okay cool but uh probably raider so who are you you you're playing as the warden yeah which is why I know firsthand okay don't bother oh wow we're gonna get like a slow wow that's how can we go best of nine
[38:28.11]Yeah, just so we can sit here and I can show you the ropes, buddy.
[38:31.03]Look at this joke!
[38:33.17]You can't make that joke.
[38:35.41]Aww.
[38:38.85]Alright, so the big thing with the Raider... Whoever wins this duel gets my fucking hundred bucks!
[38:46.52]Whoever wins this gets a fucking thousand dollars via PayPal!
[38:52.42]I wonder who's gonna win.
[39:02.69]What?
[39:35.54]Really wanted to throw you off the cliff, but I goofed.
[39:38.66]Action roll.
[39:41.48]Nice dodge.
[39:42.18]Alright, alright, so for real.
[39:45.26]Okay.
[39:46.30]L2 is like eight.
[39:47.90]Plus, you know, you got light attack, heavy attack, right?
[39:52.24]You press them both at the same time for Raider.
[39:55.87]That is unblockable.
[39:57.29]That's like your big, like, fuck you, I think you're gonna block.
[40:01.73]You just throw that out there.
[40:03.63]The other, the big thing with Raider is you dash, either left or right, and then it's a light attack.
[40:12.61]Dash.
[40:12.99]Can you dash, like, L3?
[40:16.51]Uh, it's A in a direction.
[40:18.93]Oh, okay.
[40:19.51]So you do that, and then you press the light attack, and he does, like, a really quick overhead, and if that hits someone, it stuns them.
[40:24.91]Like, you can't, this whole screen turns white, and I can't see what direction you'll attack from.
[40:29.10]Okay.
[40:30.00]So usually to hit someone with that, too, you can go into the unblockable, because they'll play defensive, and they won't be able to block it, and you chunk a huge bunch of damage out of them.
[40:37.74]So how can you tell when you have, do I need, like, a certain amount of stamina to do the unblockable?
[40:42.94]Uh, yeah.
[40:43.64]You can just see how much stamina goes away when you use it.
[40:45.52]Yeah.
[40:46.26]That's a fucking thousand dollars, by the way.
[40:50.09]Because that's what I meant.
[40:54.55]I meant like this time.
[40:56.01]Pay up!
[41:00.48]Alright, so, cool.
[41:01.30]Okay.
[41:02.18]The other very important thing might be hard for you to do from the advanced tutorial.
[41:08.66]Is there's a parry.
[41:10.34]You know how Dark Souls, you beat Dark Souls 3 on streams.
[41:12.58]You know how important parries are.
[41:13.71]Yeah, of course.
[41:14.11]But if you do a heavy attack to me...
[41:17.11]Like, right before it hits, you press heavy attack yourself in blocking in that direction, and you'll get a parry.
[41:23.95]And you're guaranteed a throw after that.
[41:25.41]They can't break the throw, and usually you're guaranteed a hit.
[41:27.85]Really?
[41:28.95]So do I have to be in the same spot that you are?
[41:32.63]Yeah.
[41:33.01]You have to block it normally, but right before the block, you also press heavy attack.
[41:36.99]So this is a big slow swing.
[41:39.41]You have to do it right at the end, okay?
[41:40.75]Okay.
[41:43.73]I didn't get it.
[41:45.17]Didn't do it.
[41:48.68]There you go.
[41:50.20]So how am I supposed to determine if you're doing a heavy attack or not?
[41:52.58]Will that work with a light attack or no?
[41:54.40]It works with anything.
[41:55.28]You can even do it to your unblockable.
[41:57.14]Unblockables are unblockable, but they are parryable.
[42:00.30]So most people can't do that in this game.
[42:03.91]Should I be doing shit like this?
[42:06.23]Which way is he going to go?
[42:07.79]Probably not.
[42:08.09]Which way is he going to go?
[42:09.03]He's going to go this way.
[42:15.12]Probably not.
[42:19.85]Probably not.
[42:20.33]Alright.
[42:20.51]Is there any way to prevent that from happening?
[42:23.21]Prevent what?
[42:25.27]Oh, right when you see the red thing show up on me, or when you hear the grab, and there's like a blue aura that pops out, you press the throw button.
[42:35.01]Don't mash it.
[42:35.71]If you mash it, you automatically won't get it.
[42:37.99]So you have to do it right when you see it coming.
[42:41.33]Right when it happens.
[42:42.77]Yeah.
[42:44.01]So when I see that, I hit square right when I see that happen.
[42:47.23]Yeah.
[42:48.83]Okay, I get you.
[42:50.17]So you have like a split second.
[42:51.97]Yeah, but if I parry your attack and then grab you, you can't block it.
[42:55.85]Okay, I feel you.
[42:56.95]So if you're at an edge and you know someone's parrying, like it gets really risky to throw out attacks because they get a guaranteed throw and can just throw you off cliffs and shit.
[43:04.51]Yeah.
[43:05.54]So how do you, like, throw somebody off a cliff?
[43:07.40]Like, if you, if I were to, like, I know, like, the double grab there, but, oh, okay.
[43:10.98]Oh, yeah, Raider gets, like, a super charge if you press X again, but usually it's just you grab and then in a direction you press the throw again.
[43:17.77]Oh, alright.
[43:18.87]So can I, ah, I get it.
[43:20.97]That's cool.
[43:21.35]Yeah, and if you hit someone into a wall, you usually get a guaranteed heavy swing.
[43:25.29]Cool.
[43:29.81]Alright, I feel ya.
[43:30.93]Anything else?
[43:33.62]The other big one, advanced, you probably won't be using it at first, but you can throw out an attack and if you press, are you using a PlayStation controller?
[43:41.78]Yeah.
[43:43.42]What's the button on the right, circle?
[43:44.78]Yeah, circle.
[43:46.28]Yeah, if you press circle while you're doing an attack, it faints the attack.
[43:50.16]That's so okay.
[43:51.19]Yeah, that's actually like so a big letter later in the game when you're learning it is that So, you know to parry my attacks you have to press heavy right before I swing Yeah so what people will do is like the best thing for me is I go for that and then you go to parry it and I get a counter because you you can't stop your swing at that point No, God
[44:12.98]This is like, there's a lot going on here.
[44:14.64]You're not gonna see anyone doing that.
[44:16.88]That's like, that's above most people's heads like you're saying, oh god, right now.
[44:24.57]Yeah.
[44:25.13]Okay.
[44:26.43]But then I actually don't.
[44:27.51]You're dead.
[44:28.43]Alright, let's play.
[44:29.89]Might as well just go.
[44:32.24]I'm only gonna learn by playing, right?
[44:33.98]Mm-hmm.
[44:41.57]So what's like the fun game mode to play?
[44:45.53]I just like 2v2 and duels.
[44:47.33]I don't like Dominion that much.
[44:50.27]But I have found that this is definitely a game that's way more fun with friends.
[44:54.26]I can see that.
[44:55.38]It gets kind of lonely.
[45:01.72]Oh, I fucked it up!
[45:11.48]You fucked up!
[45:13.26]No I didn't.
[45:14.80]Wait did they change that?
[45:30.60]Alright, let's back out.
[45:31.86]Let's play a game.
[45:35.12]I thought you said you couldn't go off the cliff.
[45:37.50]No, you could be thrown off of them.
[45:39.16]It's actually, it's weird in a way where if you're thrown in the general direction of it, you'll hit the ground and the game like really wants you to go off the cliff.
[45:47.25]That's the other, hold on, one more thing you should learn about Raider.
[45:50.11]I think is if you do, if you just run, don't lock onto me and just like press down L3 and run and then press square at me.
[45:59.41]Oh, it's like a big tackle.
[46:01.59]Yeah, you carry someone pretty far, so a lot of raiders will just, like, hang out by, like, cliffs and try and be dumbasses.
[46:08.19]Okay, yeah, I like that.
[46:11.39]And that, uh, the knee that you do also blinds me at the end.
[46:14.54]Cool.
[46:16.36]I think, uh, if you do a regular grab to me, and then you do X and you keep, yeah, you also get it that way.
[46:24.18]Okay, that's cool.
[46:26.73]Alright, you ready?
[46:27.63]I'm ready.
[46:34.36]This is fucking so stupid.
[46:35.71]I love it.
[46:38.45]Oh, Twitch Prime members claim the Twitch loot.
[46:43.55]Do you want to do 2v2 or Dominion or what do you want to do?
[46:48.33]I feel like 2v2 would not be a great idea right now.
[46:51.29]Just because it's going to be you versus two people.
[46:55.98]I still need to learn how to play.
[46:58.56]It would be me.
[47:00.38]I would be one of the default shitty soldiers with a regular t-shirt on with you.
[47:05.25]I'm pretty confident in winning the 1v2.
[47:08.45]Well, we'll just do one or two of these and then we'll go through it.
[47:11.17]Alright, I'm just going to stay with the guy I was with.
[47:24.30]Stay with the Raider.
[47:25.78]Straightforward.
[47:26.39]Now, what about this shit?
[47:28.05]Like, marked for death.
[47:29.55]Rush.
[47:29.93]Second win.
[47:30.49]Like, what is this stuff?
[47:31.35]Like, loadouts?
[47:31.99]It's the loadout.
[47:33.67]It's like killstreaks.
[47:35.35]Really?
[47:36.41]Yeah, so when you get enough kills or you kill enough of the goons in the middle, you start unlocking renown points, and the renown points are those.
[47:43.23]Oh, okay.
[47:44.86]So the first one's, like, obviously not just a killstreak.
[47:48.54]They turn them into scorestreaks as well.
[47:50.58]Cool.
[47:51.58]Yeah, you got a different unlockable there.
[47:53.08]But you have to, like, level up each character individually, and it takes a Malenia.
[47:58.84]So this is just domination.
[48:00.82]There's nothing, this is very straightforward.
[48:02.09]Um, yeah.
[48:06.73]Here comes a tactical nuke.
[48:12.63]It's 1,000 points to win, but when you retake control of a control point that the enemy owned, they lose 100 points.
[48:20.02]So if they get 1,000, it gets to that point where you have to kill everybody.
[48:24.28]But they can capture one of your points, then you go below 1,000, and then they can respawn again.
[48:28.74]That's the only weird thing.
[48:29.90]Got it, got it, got it.
[48:33.49]Got it.
[48:36.35]So there's team killing in this game, if I understand correctly, right?
[48:40.31]It's like 10% team damage, but yeah, you can hit teams.
[48:42.80]Why isn't everybody a raider on their team?
[48:46.44]Straightforward.
[48:48.14]I know that's straightforward, but that's supposed to be my straightforward.
[48:50.50]How come always like the pick and ban?
[48:52.17]Hey, test your mettle against him.
[48:54.21]Alright, fine.
[48:54.93]I'm going to like forget which one I am.
[48:56.55]So just remember, I'm a raider, so I sprint right in, right?
[48:59.21]Yeah.
[49:00.77]And we got our entire, like, fucking baseball stadium team.
[49:04.17]Come on, shit, this guy's fucked.
[49:05.89]I'm gonna do a wooden star top.
[49:08.63]Let's go, buddy!
[49:17.62]Ooh.
[49:19.62]Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[49:21.28]You got three guys on.
[49:23.08]I'm getting, like, wood chucked.
[49:27.26]Will this guy next to me stop fucking wood chucking me?
[49:31.78]He's chasing this guy.
[49:33.52]We're gonna get him.
[49:34.08]He thinks he's gonna get back in with his friends.
[49:35.47]No, I will chase you, you little wood, you little motherfucker.
[49:38.37]My executioner.
[49:40.99]Oh, there's three people today.
[49:43.94]Oh.
[49:46.84]What do I do?
[49:47.52]Do I take his emblem or something?
[49:51.24]Three today?
[49:52.70]Yeah.
[49:53.74]I'm dead.
[49:54.26]You lost zone A. You captured zone C. My guy's gonna run around like he doesn't know what to do.
[50:00.44]He's like, oh shit, which way do I go?
[50:01.59]Which one's A?
[50:02.07]I think it's this one.
[50:03.41]I don't even know.
[50:04.13]Which way do I go?
[50:04.67]We're in a fucking war.
[50:05.49]I don't know.
[50:06.31]Where are we going?
[50:08.99]Where are we going?
[50:14.78]Oh shit.
[50:15.44]Oh.
[50:15.56]Oh.
[50:15.82]Oh.
[50:16.20]Oh, this is fucking great.
[50:17.32]It's everywhere.
[50:17.88]They're all like,
[50:25.81]They were just fucking smashing each other.
[50:33.93]I think we were all raiders.
[50:36.91]Oh, if you stand in a control point you own, you gain health if no one's in it.
[50:40.11]Oh, cool, okay.
[50:40.51]What do we got?
[50:41.88]There's two guys over here by B.
[50:54.22]I'm scared.
[50:54.74]I need help.
[50:58.11]Oh my god, there's three people here again.
[51:00.21]I gotta run.
[51:04.85]There's three people just chasing me.
[51:06.47]There's this fucking Scooby Doo.
[51:07.73]What the hell?
[51:09.37]I got three Scrappy Doos behind me.
[51:11.01]I need help.
[51:13.01]God damn it.
[51:18.10]What the fuck?
[51:21.70]Alright, well I guess do whatever you want and cap whatever you want.
[51:24.78]Half their team is on me.
[51:28.96]I'm... I'm kicking ass.
[51:34.27]Dammit.
[51:40.33]I hate fighting two people at the same time.
[51:50.17]Alright, this guy doesn't even know I'm gonna get right behind him.
[51:51.81]He thinks he's gonna go up the ladder.
[51:53.39]You climb so fast!
[51:54.39]That's- You don't- Nobody climbs this fast!
[51:57.13]Oh yeah!
[51:59.11]This guy... This guy just doesn't... What the fuck is going on here?
[52:07.54]This is not for honor!
[52:08.66]This is not honorable!
[52:10.24]This is like dancing around the fucking fire!
[52:13.68]Your honor!
[52:14.68]Where is it?
[52:15.74]I don't see any honor in you!
[52:16.89]Dude, I'll fight you through the fountain!
[52:25.77]honorable I'll show you honor hey mine was very not honorable that was so that was so dishonorable what I just did
[52:54.86]That was extremely dishonorable.
[53:01.06]Oh, he's winning so hard.
[53:03.48]I am on, like, a very large kill stream.
[53:11.24]Kill their heroes.
[53:14.74]Alright, that's it, right?
[53:17.75]Yeah.
[53:20.43]I'm playing this other game down here.
[53:22.79]I died once.
[53:31.16]Um, like I was saying, if they drop our points below a thousand, like they just did because they captured a point, they can respawn again.
[53:39.22]And now they can again because we got a thousand again.
[53:45.30]Dammit!
[53:46.18]There's one more guy here.
[54:01.66]Where are you going?
[54:02.24]No, not this shit again.
[54:05.81]Not this again, man.
[54:06.71]Are you really going to do this to me again?
[54:09.35]Are you going to run around in a circle again?
[54:10.83]Nope.
[54:11.35]See, this time, I... No, he's not going to.
[54:12.97]He's going to keep going out the exit.
[54:15.19]What the fuck?
[54:15.61]No, he's dead.
[54:31.99]Uh, I think we won.
[54:36.88]You have to kill the last two people.
[54:40.76]I can do that.
[54:44.68]You see three of these guys up there chasing somebody.
[54:46.25]I get to the same shit that I did.
[55:05.33]Oh, this guy's running out.
[55:06.67]That was a duel that I won.
[55:14.77]So how are they gaining more?
[55:16.47]Oh, okay, I see.
[55:17.07]Because they have a... There's just one guy left over here.
[55:20.30]I gotta get good.
[55:25.62]Let's go!
[55:40.34]He was gonna run.
[55:43.50]You don't let him run.
[55:45.80]That was fun.
[55:57.78]Yeah.
[55:59.75]It's a game.
[56:00.17]Am I playing on console?
[56:01.53]No, I'm playing on PC with a PS4 controller.
[56:07.11]Am I still loud?
[56:08.59]You're loud?
[56:09.11]You shouldn't be.
[56:11.53]Okay.
[56:13.50]And yeah, the items that you get only affect that game mode.
[56:17.28]Ah, okay, that's cool.
[56:19.34]So everywhere else is like... serious business.
[56:23.54]Also, you can either sit here for a minute, and if one person has left the game, you can't start a game again.
[56:29.44]You have to quit back to the world map every time.
[56:33.78]Really?
[56:34.82]And last beta, there was a bug where if you quit with group, it never worked and you had to re-invite everybody again.
[56:43.86]Well, that sounds terrible.
[56:45.58]Yeah.
[56:50.02]That sounds terrible.
[56:58.24]This is fun, though.
[56:58.84]Like, I actually feel like I could be playing this game.
[57:02.12]It just got inherently louder.
[57:06.72]Alright, so you got to explain.
[57:07.72]What's this whole thing with Overwatch you were talking about?
[57:10.98]You said it was too long to explain in, like, a text of what's going on.
[57:14.20]Well, no, you can make, like, 1v6 game modes where you make one person, like, the super boss or just outrageous everything.
[57:21.87]Like, it kind of reminds me of...
[57:24.62]How Halo used to be, where you could just make weird Halo zombie game modes and all that stuff.
[57:28.70]Yeah.
[57:29.22]When did they put that in?
[57:32.28]A couple days ago.
[57:34.11]I guess Tuesday.
[57:37.21]It's still pretty limited in what you can do, but it's a ton of fun.
[57:43.25]It's very casual.
[57:44.13]Not a big deal.
[57:46.53]I like those words.
[57:48.21]I knew that was the word you wanted.
[57:49.67]Yep.
[57:54.43]Did we just get thrown into a game that was already in progress?
[57:59.09]Yeah.
[58:00.25]Of course we did.
[58:00.87]Alright, that means we have to really be good.
[58:05.74]Oh boy.
[58:06.64]We're winning this.
[58:07.16]I guess.
[58:23.39]My god What you can do that shit you can do that you can butt stop them like was this guy fucking Yoshi I
[58:58.12]God damn it.
[59:00.40]God damn it.
[59:02.02]I'll get you up.
[59:03.32]Just wait a second.
[59:04.10]Let me kill this guy.
[59:06.62]Or I guess both of these guys.
[59:12.57]I'm gonna... I'm getting there.
[59:14.97]Are you good?
[59:15.87]I'll get you up.
[59:20.27]Oh, there's one more.
[59:21.95]Are you dead?
[59:22.45]Yeah.
[59:23.67]Oh, shit.
[59:28.61]I just like sprinted after that guy and like his buddy came up behind me.
[59:38.82]I'm doing the reverse slip and slide.
[59:40.20]There we go.
[59:46.60]Is that you on the ladder?
[59:47.68]Oh, he's bugged.
[59:49.04]He can't move.
[59:50.06]What is he doing?
[59:51.72]He'll be stuck there for the rest of the game.
[59:54.06]Wait, why?
[59:55.49]Because this is for honor.
[59:59.07]The game that's launching in two days.
[60:02.21]Why can't I not hurt him?
[60:04.11]He can't be hurt.
[60:04.91]He can't be knocked down.
[60:06.35]He will be there forever.
[60:10.75]You lost, Sony C. That is so stupid.
[60:14.31]Okay.
[60:18.07]This dude's gonna be there the whole game.
[60:19.49]Can I throw, like, knives at him?
[60:22.99]I mean, if you kill him somehow, he'll respawn.
[60:25.51]Hold on, I need to go test him.
[60:26.60]You really want that?
[60:39.27]Oh shit, another person.
[60:41.47]Wait.
[60:45.37]Oh god dammit!
[60:47.95]I was trying to do like a joke.
[60:55.32]Oh god, my god!
[60:56.80]Sounds like the joke didn't work.
[61:05.12]I freed that guy, and then he threw me into a pit.
[61:09.29]I wanted to rescue him and now he's fucking dead.
[61:43.55]Oh shit, don't do it!
[61:48.43]No!
[61:50.43]I'll do it to you, you motherfucker!
[62:02.26]Team killer.
[62:05.06]No, I didn't kill my teammate, what?
[62:09.02]What are they talking about?
[62:12.27]Team killer I'm slowing it down no more like jokes
[62:55.71]What the fuck just happened?
[62:57.67]What just happened to my guy?
[63:01.75]Did somebody throw something at me?
[63:02.79]I just got hit in the face with a rock and I died.
[63:11.72]Somebody threw a rocket.
[63:12.56]I think the assassin had a crossbow ability.
[63:19.31]what at the level four which I'm gonna have really soon let me let me show you something silly that that is in the game this is a thing in the game you ready alright where are you I'm in here and be with you right next to you okay will you see me right next to you see all these guys in front of us yeah I'm a main
[63:43.33]Why do you get that?
[63:45.19]Why the fuck do you get that move?
[63:54.22]I'm going to go kill somebody.
[63:57.30]Oh, this is your last life.
[63:59.18]My last life.
[63:59.70]Well, I'm going to make it count because I'm going to kill three people.
[64:04.20]For instance, this fucking idiot.
[64:05.28]Yeah.
[64:15.38]Nice, nice.
[64:18.06]Don't touch my fucking friend.
[64:21.52]What did I tell you?
[64:26.50]Don't touch my buddy.
[64:35.95]You captured Zone C.
[64:48.60]I have to go back up to A. Shit, my fucking game is lagging.
[65:07.13]What the fuck?
[65:09.10]My fucking game like fucking... What the fuck was that?
[65:18.97]This game's very frustrating.
[65:26.13]Blame lag?
[65:26.67]I am gonna blame lag.
[65:27.59]I just like, my game, my fucking screen just started hanging.
[65:33.66]What the fuck is, what the hell was that noise?
[65:40.30]Must be someone summoning thunder.
[65:42.24]No, no, that's the windows sound.
[65:45.10]Is what just happened.
[65:51.56]That was fucking dog shit.
[65:54.25]Alright, we did it.
[65:56.79]I unplugged my mouse.
[66:03.95]I kind of got my ass kicked in that.
[66:15.53]All's well that ends well.
[66:16.85]You know, here's what I... What I have trouble with is... Um...
[66:23.01]that like hitting timing square for when somebody does like the break to you and like the little broken red shield comes up I feel like I get hit by that and then somebody does an overhand head swing and like kills me yeah the uh the hunched over character in there the two swords yeah is gonna go for that most of the time because they have a really damaging stab in the side thing so just you gotta watch for it you gotta be ready
[66:49.04]Yeah, I think it's also learning, like, just what every character can do.
[66:52.88]I guess, right?
[66:54.64]Yeah.
[66:55.56]Yeah.
[66:57.32]Thank you guys all for the subs.
[67:00.67]But, you know, I'm... I'm so bad at paying attention to new subs.
[67:05.83]And, like, resubs and shit.
[67:08.19]Like, when we start talking about the game, and all of a sudden I look over and I'm like, Whoa, fuck, I missed, like, 19 people.
[67:14.95]Just know that I love... It's one of those games, too, where you gotta be a focuser.
[67:18.52]yeah I hate having to focus on things oh also uh neo I may have been like when I was playing it not not a fan um maybe I think I'm gonna play it again when I'm not like drinking whiskey and like maybe I'll like it's fun did you ever get to the first boss no
[67:49.25]Was not very far.
[67:50.01]I was right at the first boss.
[67:51.79]I think like it not much further and I would have done it I have mixed feelings They're mixed Real mixed up.
[68:02.30]Yep Alright Each person gets a guy I told you
[68:21.41]Okay, see, now he thinks I'm fucking... Your guy, your guy.
[68:32.34]What is in my fucking view right now?
[68:34.08]There's like a shaking thing.
[68:35.58]I'm dead.
[68:44.50]Oh my, that game sucks.
[68:46.65]I don't know what the fuck that was.
[68:51.66]You ruined everything and made it really confusing.
[68:57.92]We'll do this one for real though.
[68:59.10]That was a funny one.
[69:04.05]Alright, we'll do it for real now.
[69:05.15]That was a funny one.
[69:05.97]Now we're going to win every single time.
[69:07.71]I'm going for my guy.
[69:09.49]I'll take... No, you... I think you've already inspired them to be dumbasses.
[69:14.28]No?
[69:14.48]Okay.
[69:14.96]I was worried they were both coming for me.
[69:17.84]I have no fucking idea what this guy does.
[69:22.09]I'm just dead, dude.
[69:22.81]I have no fucking idea what's going on.
[69:25.15]They swing a lot.
[69:26.61]I don't know what Ken's saying.
[69:29.92]Like, I'm trying to, like, block, but at the same time, like, parry, and at the same time, attack.
[69:32.84]It's just, there's so much going on.
[69:34.24]Plus, this map runs like shit.
[69:48.57]Flawless, flawless, flawless.
[69:52.31]Like, what?
[69:52.79]Are you running at, like, fucking, like, 32 frames a second right now?
[69:56.66]Why am I?
[69:57.48]No!
[70:14.12]I'm not lagging though, no.
[70:15.66]Why am I?
[70:16.28]What the fuck?
[70:17.20]Fuck, I'm gonna fucking throw this computer out the window.
[70:21.40]I'm going to open my window and just drop it outside.
[70:24.90]You should really get a new one.
[70:26.38]Alright, I'm gonna play this one smart.
[70:29.03]Wait, what?
[70:34.45]Why did these guys just fucking fall down?
[71:10.21]didn't expect that did you oh yeah because if you um
[71:40.33]What?
[71:40.55]What?
[71:40.83]What?
[71:41.29]What?
[71:41.65]What?
[71:43.21]You're actually not doing that bad.
[71:44.59]What?
[71:46.47]Why did that not fucking grab him?
[71:49.17]That was... He didn't get out of that.
[71:50.87]What the fuck was that?
[71:51.85]You can't grab someone if they are swinging.
[71:56.04]No, but I hit him with the... He didn't get the red shield.
[71:59.24]It didn't work.
[71:59.86]I grabbed him.
[72:02.94]I didn't see, so I don't know.
[72:08.81]But uh, yeah parrying people also decreases their stamina look like a dummy
[72:52.31]Yeah!
[72:53.12]Yeah!
[73:00.34]My game is running like shit, though, for real.
[73:04.94]What's the deal with that?
[73:06.10]I don't know.
[73:07.77]When are people going to get, like, quantum computing going?
[73:13.05]You have a quantum computer, don't you?
[73:17.03]No.
[73:18.25]I don't.
[73:20.37]My computer blue screened twice the other day on launch.
[73:23.19]It was a scary day.
[73:27.51]Turn your settings down?
[73:28.47]I could do that.
[73:30.37]The last map was fine.
[73:31.21]Just for some reason, that one.
[73:35.83]It must be the water reflections.
[73:38.13]Ster, carry?
[73:39.11]That was a straight up team effort.
[73:41.45]1v1 in two different places.
[73:46.15]Ster may be carrying, but not that time.
[73:49.60]You're hitting parries and everything.
[73:51.44]You stood your own.
[73:52.70]He did the grab, and why didn't it grab?
[73:54.32]I know, really.
[73:55.60]That's what I said.
[73:57.06]That was my stream title for days.
[73:58.64]I pressed X. What happened?
[74:07.11]I pressed X. What happened?
[74:12.73]So what is Brawl?
[74:15.18]Brawl is what we just did now.
[74:18.36]There's also a 4v4 elimination.
[74:21.02]That's... I haven't played yet.
[74:24.16]But I imagine it's Mayhem.
[74:27.18]How do you do that stun again?
[74:30.10]Dash forward and light attack.
[74:31.76]Or dash to the side.
[74:36.76]When you're ready for the super raider technique... I think it's going to take a few more games.
[74:41.98]A few more games for me to get this whole thing down.
[74:55.32]What is that guy?
[74:57.52]Which one?
[74:58.50]The samurai.
[75:01.53]Is that somebody I haven't seen before?
[75:03.99]Oh, Jesus.
[75:04.45]I don't know.
[75:05.97]Is it the one you're fighting?
[75:06.67]Oh, he's running.
[75:07.31]No.
[75:13.55]Oh, don't you dare taunt!
[75:15.19]Biggest mistake of your life!
[75:24.76]Unblockable, unblockable.
[75:51.14]Thank you.
[75:51.55]Wait, he's out of stamina.
[75:53.27]He's not gonna block it.
[75:54.17]He's not gonna attack.
[75:54.95]Because when you're out of stamina, you swing so slow he can't even stop it.
[75:58.83]So how... When you get out of stamina, how do you get... You just have to, like, run away?
[76:03.20]You just have to wait, yeah.
[76:04.84]Okay.
[76:22.31]My stamina management is so bad, I need to figure that out.
[76:43.43]This game actually favors whoever's defending most often because parries drain the other person's stamina.
[76:50.36]What drains the most stamina?
[76:51.44]What's something you should never do?
[76:52.96]Because I feel like I'm out of stamina all the time.
[76:56.43]Just watch your stamina bar more.
[76:59.65]You're doing a lot of heavy attacks too.
[77:05.34]I just, this guy I've never seen in a game before, I don't think.
[77:07.81]It's the Kensei, it's the guy you were playing.
[77:09.21]Is it the Kensei?
[77:10.17]Yeah, he just has a different mask.
[77:11.47]Oh.
[77:23.72]That special, the super swing is half my stamina bar, okay.
[77:27.59]Yeah, yeah.
[77:29.03]Doing a backwards roll nukes your stamina.
[77:30.87]Yeah, okay.
[77:31.37]I'll stop doing that too.
[77:33.63]Oh yeah, yeah.
[77:34.01]If you're rolling a lot, you should never roll.
[77:36.80]If you roll, it'd be like, shit, I pressed that button.
[78:17.10]What just happened?
[78:19.02]I lost my fight earlier.
[78:20.34]I thought that was you.
[78:22.91]No.
[78:23.17]I didn't think he would fight you until your fight was over.
[78:28.21]That just startled the fuck out of me.
[78:38.38]I've tried to feint that.
[78:39.36]That was dumb.
[78:40.66]Don't.
[78:41.14]I wouldn't recommend feinting against most people.
[78:44.32]Unless you can see that they're carrying a lot.
[78:47.00]Most people are too bad for feints to work on them.
[78:52.28]Yeah.
[78:55.32]That's how I just died to him.
[78:56.92]I went to feint something and he grabbed me.
[79:02.14]Ooh, you didn't fall off.
[79:03.13]That's weird.
[79:19.09]So what takes priority?
[79:23.27]In regards to the square move.
[79:26.33]All attacks take priority.
[79:27.89]You can't grab someone if they're starting an attack.
[79:36.86]I swear to god I feel like half the time some of these things should be hitting and there's not.
[79:41.62]I did a full horizontal swing and it didn't even touch him.
[80:05.02]Button masher?
[80:05.84]No.
[80:06.82]I'm not a button masher.
[80:11.60]Yes!
[80:14.90]Yes!
[80:25.05]I suck.
[80:26.65]Well, this is my first like 45 minutes in this video game ever.
[80:30.19]It's a very hard game.
[80:33.72]It's yeah, you know, it's real easy to suck when this is the first time you've ever played this game.
[80:39.47]It's one of those games, too, where it's really easy to get frustrated because you learn, like, the basic rules, and then there's these really specific things it doesn't tell you about that break those rules.
[80:50.98]And you'll die to them and be really upset about it.
[80:53.60]Like, I didn't know for the longest time the two-axe-wielding berserker deals damage through block.
[80:59.18]So a lot of times I'm like, I fucking blocked that!
[81:00.83]What happened?
[81:01.23]Because you'd assume when the game crashes every game...
[81:03.97]That the game sucks.
[81:05.74]I'm having fun.
[81:07.28]Like, I'm... Well, there was a lot of network issues before, too.
[81:10.24]Mm-hmm.
[81:11.64]But yeah.
[81:13.43]This is cool.
[81:17.83]Bring back the mayo stream.
[81:23.36]I keep playing new games to be able to use that excuse all the time.
[81:27.39]When you play a new game, that's what you're talking about.
[81:31.47]When you play a new game that comes out, you can't be expected to know what the fuck you're doing.
[81:35.15]Look, I can't play this game for like fucking 12 hours and then get in a time machine and stream it for the first time.
[81:43.82]That would be awesome.
[81:45.04]I mean, I would probably be pretty good, wouldn't I?
[81:47.56]I'm not even bored of it by the time I streamed it.
[81:50.24]I know, right?
[81:50.78]Really?
[81:51.18]Right?
[81:52.90]Yeah.
[81:53.20]You're going to play 40 hours of Planet Coaster, I heard.
[82:00.12]Yep.
[82:00.98]Yep.
[82:01.92]Yep.
[82:02.28]You got me.
[82:12.68]You get one free excuse per game.
[82:14.54]That's true, Cheetah.
[82:15.84]That's true.
[82:22.50]Well, that was new.
[82:26.24]Fucking gravestone really.
[82:29.26]What the fuck?
[82:51.88]Game sucks.
[82:54.04]Damn.
[83:04.84]I think you should have done the unblockable there because of how low in stamina he was.
[83:11.76]Ooh!
[83:12.00]Yeah, he's gonna be real defensive.
[83:17.72]The other guy's still alive.
[83:18.70]Where the hell is he?
[83:22.71]Uh, he was back here somewhere.
[83:24.33]Yeah.
[83:36.10]God, I'm getting so carried right now.
[83:40.54]These maps are kind of gorgeous.
[83:41.62]They are.
[83:41.94]Can I, I can revive you?
[83:43.84]Yeah.
[83:48.60]2v2, everyone treats it kind of as a 2-1v1.
[83:52.14]Oh, this guy's doing moves I've never seen before.
[83:58.94]Holy shit.
[83:59.39]Okay.
[84:01.05]Oh, I gotta do the unblockable.
[84:02.05]No!
[84:02.55]You guys see how fucking awful that lag was?
[84:07.69]I have to blame that.
[84:14.36]If he backs up like that, he wants to do his jump forward overhead.
[84:22.73]Carry that shit.
[84:24.33]I'm getting so carried right now.
[84:26.59]Oh, my brother!
[84:27.85]Oh no, my brother!
[84:40.85]No, they come for you both.
[84:42.94]They want to try to get rid of you quick.
[84:48.34]Oh, that backfired.
[84:52.56]The other guy just abandoned him.
[84:53.82]Yeah, he really did.
[84:54.58]Why did he leave his friend?
[85:03.78]Hey, it works good job Press press triangle a lot You guy got like stuck into not knowing what he wanted to do I
[85:31.26]Sorry for my teammate, guys.
[85:33.54]Wait, that guy was a bot.
[85:35.46]I think he left early.
[85:36.56]No.
[85:44.50]This game is fun.
[85:47.02]I like this game.
[85:50.36]I might not ever be the most advanced player, but I feel like I could be playing this game for a little while.
[86:00.50]At least in the short term, I would say.
[86:05.92]Yeah.
[86:10.76]So this is just going to be in open beta until it comes out?
[86:15.66]It's in open beta tomorrow.
[86:18.25]Tomorrow's the last day.
[86:20.01]But then it's two days before launch.
[86:21.79]Yeah.
[86:26.39]There also is a co-op single player with the full game.
[86:30.98]I think a lot of people keep forgetting about, like, is it worth $65?
[86:35.81]Uh, you go through, like, you pretty much, they showed it at E3, you, like, raid a castle and fight, like, NPC bosses.
[86:44.72]Really?
[86:45.42]And duel them, and there's a whole bunch of little guys you have to fight before them.
[86:49.10]I don't know how long it's gonna be, but, I mean, it's there.
[86:54.44]That's cool.
[86:57.95]Jerma's never going to buy this game, calling it right now.
[87:00.89]That's not true.
[87:05.40]Co-op single player.
[87:06.18]Well, it's not single player.
[87:07.28]Well, it could be.
[87:07.76]You know what I mean.
[87:09.06]God damn it.
[87:09.56]Co-operative.
[87:15.90]Missing player is going to learn.
[87:17.72]There's not, like, one other person queuing up for doubles in this game?
[87:20.28]Come on.
[87:20.69]What the hell is this?
[87:29.02]Who would you say is the most fun?
[87:30.60]And why is there a strange dial tone in the background of your house right now?
[87:36.34]Who's there?
[87:36.72]I think it's because Ashley's walking around.
[87:41.29]My game crashed.
[87:44.81]So if I go into customize, is there anything I can do here?
[87:50.81]There's a trigger where you can change the color.
[87:53.13]I forget what the button is.
[87:54.03]It'll tell you somewhere.
[87:55.49]You can upgrade your gear?
[87:58.44]yeah does it make it oh it does change it oh damn okay well feet cooldown reduction what is feet cooldown reduction uh the the feats that you have in dominion oh they all have cooldowns when you use them generally okay revenge mode duration
[88:28.56]It's when you get mad and you're really salty.
[88:31.20]Yeah.
[88:32.08]I've been there, man.
[88:33.04]I know how it is.
[88:35.91]Yeah, I know how it is.
[88:37.89]Alright, so Raider... Who else is a fun thing to play that's not extremely complicated?
[88:46.74]Um... What about the Conqueror?
[88:51.00]Conqueror looks cool.
[88:52.22]Conqueror is like...
[88:54.78]Kinda brain dead, that was actually what I was gonna say.
[88:56.76]Because all you do is stand there and block.
[88:59.44]And they have like an auto-block.
[89:00.96]They're just like... I don't understand how to kill people with them.
[89:05.53]Or how to do good.
[89:07.17]Confirmed.
[89:07.53]I'm gonna use it.
[89:08.07]You don't have to recruit people.
[89:09.93]Recruiting them just means they can level up.
[89:11.89]Oh.
[89:13.21]Well, I'll try it.
[89:15.87]And... I'll give it a go.
[89:20.79]Peacekeeper is actually not that complicated.
[89:24.66]It's just very timing based.
[89:27.42]Yeah.
[89:27.64]Okay, I'm inviting you again.
[89:32.56]Okie dokie.
[89:35.16]Okie dokie.
[89:42.22]There we go.
[89:47.99]Did I join you?
[89:49.93]Yep.
[89:51.29]One moment.
[89:56.79]There we go.
[90:05.57]Alright.
[90:06.39]So I have no idea how to use this guy, but I'm just gonna, you know, you're gonna have to carry here.
[90:10.40]Bad.
[90:11.14]Hard.
[90:13.00]Okay.
[90:15.08]All you told me is this guy, like, blocks.
[90:18.22]I don't remember any of his buttons either, so I don't think I can coach you.
[90:20.84]Alright, here we go.
[90:23.62]I know that's similar.
[90:24.69]If you do a dash and press X, I think, or square, you get, like, a shield bash.
[90:31.09]And the same way you run and grab before, you can run and shield bash.
[90:34.89]Why do they get the mage from Trine?
[90:40.44]That's not what he looks like.
[90:41.58]Yeah.
[90:42.38]Maybe a little bit.
[90:43.68]And I'm the knight from Trine.
[90:46.20]This game's just Trine.
[90:48.04]Can I get this mouse off my screen?
[90:49.26]People are gonna be really upset about this real quick, and I can't get it off.
[90:53.26]Get out of here.
[90:55.04]Why the fuck is this mouse on my screen?
[90:56.50]Oh god, my lag.
[91:00.82]This is my lag.
[91:03.82]Like, this is the fucking map that makes people feel like shit.
[91:06.60]Uh-oh.
[91:30.21]I don't know anything.
[91:30.69]I don't know.
[91:31.09]You know, it's just map.
[91:32.88]Like, fuck this map.
[91:34.02]Fuck this fucking 28 frames a second map.
[91:36.02]And fuck this new character.
[91:39.71]It's not, you know, if it was a consistent, like, 30 frames a second, I'd be fine, but it's like... If this map on my computer could talk, that's what it would sound like.
[91:50.64]If this map did it right, then I would know how to play this character that I just picked at random.
[91:54.64]No, but look, it's going... It's not even consistent.
[91:56.70]If it wasn't... I'd be fine.
[91:57.50]What are you doing?
[92:13.73]I have no fucking idea what this person's doing.
[92:17.07]That person's gonna kick your ass.
[92:18.81]They seem actually really good.
[92:21.81]And I'm... I'm getting for honored.
[92:25.03]Fucking trine mage.
[92:42.47]I'm just gonna stand here.
[92:48.70]This guy's like swings, it's so odd.
[93:04.34]I can't even tell.
[93:06.58]I have no idea what I'm doing.
[93:14.73]Oh my god, get me off this piece of shit character.
[93:18.91]Alright, get me off this map and get me off this character.
[93:24.75]This game just became the worst game I've ever played because of this map and this character.
[93:28.16]Worst game I've ever played, Milo.
[93:29.32]Worse than fucking E.T.
[93:32.06]Have you ever played that game?
[93:33.26]Oh, yeah.
[93:35.14]For Honor has been confirmed to be worse than E.T.
[93:37.36]Worst game I've ever played.
[93:39.77]Only when it's in this situation, this character, and this map on my computer.
[93:46.34]Heh heh heh heh heh
[94:10.24]Play more Priya.
[94:10.94]I'm just fucking around, guys.
[94:14.44]I'm just kidding.
[94:15.80]But this map really is making playing this game annoying for me.
[94:19.30]I think it reset my graphics.
[94:20.53]I'm getting a little bit too.
[94:21.51]Oh my god.
[94:23.77]I got 400.
[94:41.08]I don't even care!
[94:43.14]Oh my god!
[94:44.38]Dude!
[94:45.52]Bitch!
[95:22.27]I was just shit-faced right there.
[95:28.39]There's no way that guy would attack three times out of stamina.
[95:35.90]And that's how you get him to lose.
[95:41.22]I'm going back to the writer.
[95:42.59]Do what I know for now.
[95:44.57]I can learn other characters later.
[95:46.59]You're much better off for quite a while playing one hero.
[95:50.87]Hero?
[95:51.21]Dude, they're not heroes.
[95:53.15]They're not heroes.
[95:54.19]Heroes.
[95:56.31]They're paladins of the realm.
[95:58.78]I'm going to drop some more graphics options.
[96:05.74]High.
[96:06.80]High.
[96:07.08]High.
[96:14.17]That's fine.
[96:22.69]They are heroes?
[96:27.38]I mean, they could be technically, they could be heroes.
[96:31.06]Why don't we call them champions?
[96:32.80]Why don't we call them villains?
[96:33.78]They could be villains too.
[96:36.12]Heroes and villains.
[96:40.70]With the new expansion, City of Villains.
[96:44.02]Holy shit, that guy's played a lot of Raider.
[96:48.29]That guy's played a lot.
[96:49.13]Alrighty.
[96:50.45]Actually, no, it's a couple days into the beta.
[96:52.97]I feel like both these guys have played a lot.
[96:54.25]Okay, we have to be good.
[97:04.05]literally referred to as heroes by the game oh yeah they are round one alright let's do this my hands on are like sweaty and they are they are didn't expect that
[97:46.74]This guy knows how to play.
[97:49.90]You'd have to.
[97:50.52]This guy knows how to play the game.
[97:59.43]How come he hit me with his but I didn't get him with mine?
[98:03.91]Not fair.
[98:09.10]How come it's pairing us up with people that have like fucking 30 hours in the game already?
[98:12.26]I honestly have no idea.
[98:16.13]This guy had a prestige marker on his fucking name.
[98:40.85]God damn it.
[98:42.27]I should have just let him run.
[98:43.28]I was trying to do an attack and sometimes the game sucks and doesn't do it.
[99:00.58]That's my explanation.
[99:17.77]She's stabbing me in the dick.
[99:19.41]That's great.
[99:21.45]I just... I can't play against people that don't know how to play like this.
[99:27.21]I died, apparently.
[99:28.35]I parried her and then I died.
[99:34.49]That raider is actually really bad.
[99:36.77]I just don't understand this character.
[99:40.21]I don't know what she does.
[99:43.89]This character is doing moves that I've never fucking seen before.
[100:03.95]Two times in a row I got perfected.
[100:05.41]Yeah, well, give me 40 fucking hours in the game.
[100:07.94]We'll see what happens.
[100:21.30]Yeah, okay.
[100:23.80]You have 40 hours in the game.
[100:27.21]Yeah, okay.
[100:27.69]You're on the same level as these people.
[100:28.97]You played before.
[100:29.75]You played a shitload of this game.
[100:30.99]I'm above these people.
[100:32.17]Yeah, you are.
[100:34.55]You're dealing with me, the fucking new scrub.
[100:37.07]I'm not saying anything bad.
[100:38.88]No, I'm just kidding.
[100:45.34]Here we go.
[100:46.02]I should've did that.
[100:47.32]I should've did that.
[100:49.84]Fucking- I hate this game so much.
[100:56.34]It's so bad.
[100:59.18]It doesn't make any sense.
[101:11.79]I don't know what the fuck I was doing.
[101:12.85]That person has like one hit.
[101:13.74]I don't know why I was doing that.
[101:15.70]That person has one hit.
[101:17.60]One hit.
[101:18.16]Really?
[101:18.50]One hit.
[101:19.62]One hit.
[101:19.92]She's full health.
[101:21.47]Really?
[101:21.71]I think it's because she executed.
[101:23.31]Oh no.
[101:23.53]Oh no.
[101:28.36]She's got one hit I walk over she's got like fucking 60% health yeah Go try to like grab her or something oh
[101:53.91]She was letting you do that 1v1 anyway.
[101:55.62]I know, but I was trying to be dishonorable.
[101:59.60]He's so dead.
[102:09.96]He's out of stamina.
[102:10.74]We're both out of stamina somehow.
[102:31.77]You got this he's out of stamina get up on Don't use that attack ever.
[102:39.78]I'm just like don't I'm Hey, hey, I'm your coach here.
[102:43.58]Alright.
[102:43.86]I'm not judging.
[102:44.46]I'm your coach.
[102:45.06]I'm your coach He's gonna you every time he matches he goes for the upper always block upper Harry the other fucking you got him.
[102:52.12]Oh
[102:57.81]When you throw people on the ground, you'll be unblockable.
[102:59.75]You can't get up on the ground.
[103:07.96]You want us to bait me over by that ledge, don't you?
[103:09.88]No, no, he's running because he was low on stamina.
[103:13.62]Fuck this!
[103:21.44]Wait, what?
[103:23.27]What just happened?
[103:26.05]I've never seen that before.
[103:29.26]What?
[103:29.66]I just... I got him.
[103:31.98]I got him.
[103:33.40]I fucking killed him.
[103:35.44]Are you fighting me?
[103:36.30]No.
[103:37.92]What is happening?
[103:38.70]I don't understand.
[103:46.85]Why is he still alive?
[103:49.15]You... Okay, on my screen...
[103:52.27]He hit you and killed you, but for some reason you kept charging and had him in your hands and kept doing the animation, but you were dead the whole time you were doing it.
[104:00.59]What?
[104:01.93]What the fuck?
[104:12.53]Damn it.
[104:14.99]Y'arrives, curipeta!
[104:18.25]Y'arrives, curipeta!
[104:25.09]Oh, come on you.
[104:28.19]Shit.
[104:33.40]I'm probably gonna lose this fight.
[104:59.47]Alright, so... I'm still having trouble figuring this out.
[105:06.98]Yeah.
[105:07.52]So when he's out of stamina, what am I supposed to do?
[105:10.78]I have to just run at him?
[105:12.34]He kept on being able to get away from me.
[105:16.04]Hold on.
[105:16.76]Every time he was out of stamina, he would just do that and get away.
[105:19.04]And I wouldn't be able to do anything.
[105:22.07]When somebody's out of stamina, what does that actually mean?
[105:25.23]That means that if they swing, their swing is going to be really slow, so they're probably not going to attack.
[105:30.94]They need to just wait out the stamina and they'll get it back eventually.
[105:33.50]So what people are going to do is run away from you.
[105:35.62]What you need to do is a lot of times go outside of a... Don't lock onto them anymore and run forward at them.
[105:42.62]Most characters have a run forward swing.
[105:44.34]I think you have a heavy attack.
[105:47.80]But you need to either do that or...
[105:50.48]It's tricky to do on Raider, because if you press X or square to grab somebody while you're running, you do that run charge that'll never hit anybody in a duel.
[105:58.49]Right, right.
[105:59.55]So you need to run up to someone, lock onto them, and then grab.
[106:03.41]Yeah, 0 and 5.
[106:05.86]Guys, we're playing against people that fucking have like 50 times more time in the game than me.
[106:10.66]Alright?
[106:11.42]You understand?
[106:11.98]Stop making fun of me!
[106:15.15]Hey, what you guys should be saying is, uh, how many we played?
[106:18.84]We're 4-0 right now, guys.
[106:20.16]4-0.
[106:21.74]We haven't lost one of these.
[106:22.90]Haven't lost one of these.
[106:24.74]No.
[106:26.86]Ready up.
[106:27.34]They want to play again.
[106:29.02]If you don't want to play them again, I understand.
[106:30.13]No, I'll play them again.
[106:33.89]Guys, I'm still figuring out what a stun does.
[106:37.39]Come on, give me a fucking break.
[106:45.42]You have to.
[106:46.39]Ready.
[106:46.89]I didn't do that?
[106:48.27]You have to hold it.
[106:48.97]It's like, um... What was that really shitty game that everyone overhyped?
[106:53.10]I need more pita.
[106:55.16]About the spaceships.
[106:57.89]Wait, what?
[107:12.97]stun stun people I know I know I'm just I'm just saying like can I catch a break at level four wait what Jerma I think you're doing really well hey thanks star
[107:41.27]With it being your first time playing, you're breaking grabs, which is better than 90% of people.
[107:47.78]You're parrying, which is better than 98% of people.
[107:49.92]I'm turning red.
[108:27.21]Get out of here.
[108:28.69]Ooh, see what I'm talking about?
[108:30.41]You know how many more hours than Jerma that guy has?
[108:32.97]Yeah.
[108:33.41]How many more hours that guy has to make?
[108:38.13]Cut it out.
[108:38.95]Is somebody still alive?
[108:40.65]That took a long time.
[108:42.24]Yeah, I know what you mean.
[108:48.90]Oh, these guys suck.
[108:51.18]I'm probably going to die because game sucks.
[108:53.58]Player sucks.
[108:54.38]No, I'm good.
[109:02.97]I don't like fighting you, I don't know what you do.
[109:15.28]This guy is just trying to grab over and over again.
[109:17.66]He did nothing but grab.
[109:21.82]Oh god, I'm in trouble.
[109:27.02]Get out of my fucking town!
[109:39.69]I'm just... Oh, Jesus.
[109:53.44]Wait, does that mean I'm dead?
[109:54.42]No.
[109:55.68]He could jump off and instantly kill you, but he messed it up.
[109:58.06]Did he really?
[109:59.24]How do I get back up there?
[110:00.26]Oh, stairs behind me.
[110:01.26]Alright.
[110:05.29]I'm back.
[110:14.34]Let's go, buddy!
[110:21.55]Come here!
[110:23.21]Nooooooo!
[110:27.15]I was out of stamina.
[110:32.87]I knew that was gonna happen.
[110:33.81]I was out of stamina.
[110:34.59]I was so fucking scared.
[110:58.31]I'm not good at fighting this lady.
[110:59.93]I really- I'm so dead.
[111:01.71]I'm gonna have to fucking get a lucky grab.
[111:06.44]Don't fucking taunt me!
[111:10.54]Ah, you're- you're in trouble.
[111:12.72]Oh, yeah, I am.
[111:16.68]That lady's just so quick and so- ah, I need to like- Learning new games is hard when there's characters you have to know everything that they do.
[111:26.53]Her main thing is the grab.
[111:42.25]No fucking around next round.
[111:44.13]I'm putting on the pants next round.
[111:46.51]My pants are already on.
[111:53.93]Yeah, that little thing.
[112:06.96]That like... Come on, Dens.
[112:12.84]Come on, Dens.
[112:15.95]Come on, Dens.
[112:18.27]Come on.
[112:23.81]No!
[112:24.47]I could have been cheap and done it.
[112:30.44]Oh.
[112:30.62]I can't believe I let her beat me.
[112:33.32]Well, alright.
[112:34.40]This is for all the cheesecake, right?
[112:36.50]Yeah, this is all the cheesecake right now.
[112:38.11]This one's for the cheesecake, guys.
[112:39.23]Wipe it off.
[112:39.73]Let's do it.
[113:01.51]That's nice if he's gonna grab throughout attacks you can't grab you Oh
[113:26.36]Did we get the cheesecake?
[113:28.26]Yeah, we got them both off the map.
[113:31.14]In the cheesiest fashion possible.
[113:34.70]We get the full cheesecake.
[113:36.66]Yeah.
[113:41.14]No honor, do it.
[113:42.24]No honor, do it.
[113:50.47]You've reached level 5.
[113:56.82]alright alright alright alright alright I like this game you said that like that was a problem god I'd like I actually like god damn it it's been a while since I've thought like a like a multiplayer game that come out was actually fun to play for more than like a little while
[114:24.58]Is this the same people?
[114:25.34]No.
[114:26.24]No.
[114:30.06]If they keep supporting this game and keep adding stuff, this is... I could play this.
[114:34.59]There's three characters that aren't in the beta.
[114:36.77]You would love one of them.
[114:39.51]You would love Fat Guy.
[114:41.07]I really want to play Fat Guy, but he hasn't been in the betas.
[114:44.33]And they teased a Centurion Roman Warrior and a Shinobi.
[114:51.06]Worse than E.T., but I like it.
[114:53.48]Oh yeah, I did say that, didn't I?
[115:10.62]Shit, I'm out of stamina.
[115:11.96]I wasn't even paying attention.
[115:13.36]That person was the worst player I've played against.
[115:16.87]What's going on?
[115:17.75]Wait, what?
[115:20.63]Wait, hold on a second.
[115:24.67]I'm like, alright.
[115:26.21]A whole bunch of weird shit just happened right there.
[115:29.69]I screamed and fell off, but I didn't.
[115:33.14]The animation happened three times.
[115:39.13]What just happened?
[115:45.33]It rewound the game.
[115:47.03]I got to see that twice.
[115:48.87]Double fall.
[115:50.21]Okay, that was weird.
[115:56.78]He pulled you back up just to drop you again.
[115:58.64]That was very strange.
[116:01.08]Game sucks.
[116:01.62]Worse than E.T.
[116:02.76]This guy, I mean, we're talking about... I mean, really, like, fucking, really... Bury this... Hey, Ubisoft.
[116:09.82]Bury this fucking game in a bunch of landfills.
[116:12.32]Where it belongs.
[116:16.29]It didn't work for her.
[116:35.62]Whoa.
[116:35.96]I just got jumpscared.
[116:40.30]I think I got peer-to-peer-ed.
[116:43.34]Okay, so honest to God, I'm getting peer-to-peer-ed.
[116:45.68]Did you see that shit?
[116:46.52]Wasn't she dead?
[116:47.32]I have no idea what the fuck is happening right now.
[116:50.98]What is going on?
[116:54.64]I can't get anything.
[116:57.19]What is happening?
[117:01.15]I have no idea what's going on.
[117:05.27]I honestly just couldn't even tell what the fuck was happening.
[117:09.38]I was getting pulled around in five different directions at the same time.
[117:16.55]Alright, I gotta be careful then.
[117:39.92]Something ain't right here.
[117:52.13]Something is not right playing with these people.
[118:12.50]Get him.
[118:15.12]Get him.
[118:17.26]Get him.
[118:19.32]Wait, what did you just do?
[118:21.02]What the fuck was that?
[118:23.41]Why did you just, like, spin behind him?
[118:25.67]What the fuck is going on?
[118:27.35]I'm so confused.
[118:29.47]Your corpse, like, flew off the ground.
[118:31.21]I don't... The weirdest things are happening playing with you.
[118:34.26]You just... That was very weird.
[118:37.38]Nothing about that made any sense.
[119:13.28]I'll tell you, I'm not fighting them again.
[119:15.22]There's a lot of wacky shit going on there.
[119:19.25]The thing that's annoying about sharing this game, too, is no one never understands when you say wacky shit.
[119:24.53]Sometimes everything just feels wrong.
[119:26.55]Yeah.
[119:27.46]A lot of stuff felt wrong in that game.
[119:30.60]Whatever.
[119:32.12]We're good.
[119:37.88]Clean.
[119:38.94]Dude, that was clean.
[119:40.02]Dude, just like my fucking pecs.
[119:44.63]Keep them clean.
[119:45.55]You got clean pecs?
[119:47.03]Yeah.
[119:49.37]Keep them glistening.
[119:55.78]Sorry, guys.
[119:56.32]This is like a raider stream, but
[119:59.89]Oh, I gave my stream three days of warden only.
[120:02.33]Oh, really?
[120:03.54]Yeah.
[120:05.48]Never mind, then.
[120:06.00]I don't need to apologize.
[120:07.54]It's hard to pick up a new character in this game.
[120:09.88]Okay, these guys have different costumes on, so that means that they're better, right?
[120:13.38]Yeah.
[120:13.90]Okay, we gotta be careful.
[120:16.28]They're playing the fashion game.
[120:21.26]And they're over there thinking, oh, these guys in default swimwear?
[120:23.81]Ha ha ha ha.
[120:29.26]7-0 the legend.
[120:31.68]That's the guy's name?
[120:33.06]Someone in chat.
[120:35.38]Are we at 7-0?
[120:35.90]I don't know.
[120:36.95]Are we at 7-0?
[120:37.59]We gotta get to like 10-0.
[120:40.81]Okay, this guy's not fighting me.
[120:42.37]He's like running over to you.
[120:43.21]You're gonna be able to see him.
[120:43.97]Watch out.
[120:44.25]Turn around.
[120:45.29]Guy like right behind you.
[120:46.59]I'm chasing after him.
[120:59.47]No, they just attack a lot Also these guys
[121:23.54]Our trash that deserves to go back into the soil!
[121:28.16]He's trying to resurrect his friend and they both like double-teamed me.
[121:31.20]Yeah, the very first thing that guy just sprinted over to you.
[121:37.63]Are they gonna do that again?
[121:38.41]I don't know.
[121:42.03]No honor.
[121:45.69]He's gonna try to kick his ass.
[121:59.52]My guy's dead.
[122:00.24]Fuck him.
[122:01.60]This was so... Sorry.
[122:09.61]Push me over.
[122:10.09]Wait, he's... Okay, he's dead.
[122:11.11]Round three.
[122:33.01]How are you doing?
[122:36.02]Alright, I'll let you have honor.
[122:45.70]Oh no!
[122:57.47]Hey, let me help you.
[122:58.07]Okay, I'm sorry.
[123:05.03]I'm sorry.
[123:06.27]That's like such a stupid dick move.
[123:10.30]One more hit.
[123:11.44]Come on, buddy.
[123:12.20]Come on, bro.
[123:13.20]Bro!
[123:27.35]Okay.
[123:28.17]Is that 8-0?
[123:31.66]Seems like it.
[123:32.46]God, I'm playing with a legendary Ster.
[123:39.78]Revive speed.
[123:41.37]Interesting.
[123:45.75]I think my game crashed again.
[123:50.23]Can you leave?
[123:51.95]Quit to world map?
[123:52.96]Yeah.
[123:53.76]I think that gets me out of this.
[123:57.81]Quick to world map.
[124:00.65]Last time played seven hours ago.
[124:02.42]What?
[124:02.52]I have to re-invite you.
[124:04.72]Yeah, the game is really well made.
[124:07.46]I didn't play this game seven hours ago.
[124:11.42]What?
[124:12.34]Welcome back, man.
[124:13.06]Thanks for playing.
[124:14.32]Am I in a dream?
[124:18.28]You need to invite me again?
[124:20.06]I did.
[124:20.66]Shift F2.
[124:23.30]The weirdest button combination ever.
[124:24.81]Yeah, it's very weird.
[124:27.90]It's very weird.
[124:36.01]Again, thanks a lot, guys, for all the subs.
[124:38.67]There's been a lot that have been coming in today.
[124:41.21]It's just... It's so... It's, like, not possible for me to, like, play this game in, like, mid-match turn and, like, say hello to people.
[124:46.37]I'm sorry.
[124:48.99]Bye-bye.
[124:50.15]Oh, Lash played seven hours ago.

[124:51.97]Oh, shit.
[124:52.45]That's right.
[124:55.41]That's right.
[125:01.64]Glad to see you playing For Honor again.
[125:03.24]Yeah, I mean, played it like eight hours ago.
[125:15.89]Alright, so that... I remember that stabby, stabby person, right?
[125:21.71]Is that the class that's currently the, uh... Isn't that the one that everybody hates?
[125:25.21]The spear person?
[125:27.45]Um... I think people got over it a little bit.
[125:29.72]Oh, they got over it?
[125:30.40]Yeah, she seems very good when you're new to the game, and her poison does a lot of damage.
[125:35.08]Get off the screen, mouse.
[125:36.40]But I don't think she's that... Interesting.
[126:01.53]Really?
[126:04.80]What?
[126:06.96]OK, why did I fall down and she didn't?
[126:30.17]Whoa, she just... What the fuck?
[126:32.54]Holy shit, I did... Okay, that was... I did not think that went that far.
[126:35.88]She, like, slid across the whole... You didn't hit her?
[126:38.32]Apparently not.
[126:40.64]Does that move go that far?
[126:41.66]That was so weird.
[126:42.64]She came, like, fucking ten feet to me.
[126:44.88]Yeah, you can charge it up.
[126:46.52]But if you charge it up, then it can't... It doesn't have a follow-up.
[126:49.22]I did not know that even existed.
[127:07.49]Well, besides Star... NOOOOOO!
[127:11.13]I thought we traded, too.
[127:12.07]If we traded, I would've killed her.
[127:14.44]Yeah, sorry.
[127:14.76]I just have to kill two people with full health.
[127:17.50]Hey, the only experience I have fighting this class is you, and you were teaching me how to play the game.
[127:45.61]Man, I flawlessed him this time, too.
[127:55.06]I goofed.
[127:56.48]Shit, I thought she was going for an attack.
[127:59.70]Oh, no, and I fell down.
[128:02.82]Nice.
[128:04.76]I don't have enough experience fighting these people!
[128:06.74]Blah!
[128:33.44]Don't attack without stamina.
[128:34.80]I know.
[128:36.14]I know.
[128:36.60]I know.
[128:37.18]I know.
[128:37.64]I know.
[128:38.12]I know.
[128:38.54]I know.
[128:40.10]Do you know?
[128:40.46]I do know.
[128:41.44]It's just a process of learning.
[129:05.36]What the fuck is going on right now?
[129:07.28]I'm trying to fucking parry.
[129:11.00]Get out of here.
[129:21.55]Like, I was trying to parry her.
[129:22.75]I just wouldn't do it.
[129:23.69]I was getting, like, overhead swing.
[129:29.28]Oh.
[129:54.56]I have so much trouble fighting this glaive person.
[129:56.76]I have no fucking idea what to do.
[130:01.50]They are... They're tricky.
[130:04.00]And that person is actually pretty good.
[130:06.36]I just have no idea how to fight this character.
[130:08.76]Not a single clue.
[130:10.90]I'm dead.
[130:13.44]Watch and learn.
[130:14.20]You're gonna go in for the big hit.
[130:17.52]I'm gonna go for a parry for you.
[130:19.26]Ah, shit.
[130:20.10]She grabbed.
[130:22.15]What is, like, all this shit?
[130:29.32]I pressed X. I knew she was doing it again, obviously.
[130:39.05]I fucking- I hate that character.
[130:42.23]That's when For Honor sucks.
[130:44.13]I don't like that character.
[130:44.97]Delete that character from the game will be soft.
[130:46.53]Worse than fucking E.T.
[131:00.54]You don't want to be over here, man.
[131:01.58]I'm telling you, you don't want to be over there.
[131:03.42]You don't want to be over there.
[131:04.62]Should I just come in?
[131:12.61]Should I just come in?
[131:13.61]Should we fucking dishonor?
[131:16.11]You can do what you want.
[131:17.21]Dishonor!
[131:26.90]Hey, wanna Dishonor this motherfucker?
[131:28.94]Back up a little.
[131:30.02]Back up a little.
[131:31.54]Oh, I know what you're doing.
[131:33.36]Get out of my face!
[131:34.48]Oh, shit!
[131:35.92]Why'd that miss?
[131:37.37]Oh, he has Revenge.
[131:41.11]That sucks.
[131:42.07]I feel so bad right now.
[131:44.49]Dishonor!
[131:45.71]He's gonna Revenge and kill you.
[131:50.14]Oh, is he now?
[131:52.62]Who are ya?
[132:01.98]I don't know how to play against this character!
[132:03.26]I don't know how to do this!
[132:05.56]I don't know how to play against this character.
[132:06.72]I don't know.
[132:09.69]I can tell you when she goes for the kick, you have to sidestep.
[132:15.67]I fucking hate that character so much with passion.
[132:24.76]You want me to be one of those, like, I fucking hate For Honor people that were playing this game that said that character sucks?
[132:30.60]It's me.
[132:31.89]Fuck that character.
[132:32.65]That character sucks.
[132:34.57]I've played against that character twice and it's a fucking cheap shit character.
[132:37.61]Like, yeah, this game sucks.
[132:53.39]Worse than E.T.
[132:54.03]No, this is like three E.T.'s.
[132:55.45]They should just like redevelop the whole game.
[133:14.42]Start from scratch.
[133:16.67]Also one earlier saying, wow, this game would be amazing if it was like Skyrim in open world, but not like this.
[133:22.11]No, this game's fucking awesome.
[133:23.73]Redevelop the whole game.
[133:25.79]I'm just fucking around.
[133:26.77]This game's great.
[133:29.42]But like, I mean, Ubisoft, if you do happen to delete that character from the game, like, you got my vote.
[133:37.32]Bam!
[133:39.63]All of their good abilities use a lot of stamina, so you have to be very aggressive against them.
[133:43.74]But being very aggressive, you have to know what their attacks are and what to avoid.
[133:49.18]It just seemed like every time I was trying to do anything, she was too far away and stabbing me.
[133:53.89]Yeah.
[133:56.17]You have to get up in there.
[133:57.63]Alright, let's do it.
[134:10.03]Oh my god, game sucks so bad.
[134:12.47]Game sucks?
[134:13.81]Yeah.
[134:18.88]As I sat there and pressed light attack three times and my character stood completely still.
[134:22.98]Oh no, there's no honor.
[134:25.24]There's no honor on this team.
[134:30.74]There's just no honor on this team.
[134:32.28]There's no honor at all.
[134:36.30]I was doing jokey shit.
[134:37.46]Come on, do some jokey shit, buddy.
[134:45.11]Like, if you want to be dishonorable, do some jokey shit.
[134:48.48]Like, try to jump off a cliff and kill me.
[134:50.16]Hit your friend with a fucking axe.
[134:56.26]I would accept dishonor if it was jokey.
[135:03.19]Oh, they're coming for you.
[135:04.11]No, they're not.
[135:06.37]I thought he was turning around to run to you.
[135:51.79]Damn it.
[135:57.84]I don't understand what I did so wrong there.
[136:01.68]I was doing fine, and he just kept getting away and hitting me.
[136:07.57]Oh, yeah.
[136:08.23]Unblockable.
[136:14.05]I don't think you should be able to run away with no stamina.
[136:16.25]That's fucking stupid.
[136:18.05]Dude, it only took you an hour to figure that out.
[136:20.12]How come the developers didn't figure that out in four years?
[136:23.60]That's a question I've been asking.
[136:26.38]Like, why can that guy just turn around and run away with no stamina?
[136:29.20]Doesn't that make no sense?
[136:32.92]Yup.
[136:43.73]That is actually awesome.
[136:44.65]It really only took you an hour to figure that out.
[136:55.00]I don't like being over here.
[136:56.62]I'm dead.
[136:57.60]Oh, god damn it.
[136:59.16]I knew what was happening and... Here, I'm dead.
[137:03.57]I'm in trouble.
[137:05.59]I don't know how to fight this guy.
[137:07.15]I'm on tilt from that last fight.
[137:08.31]I'm just on tilt in general.
[137:21.23]Like, I was trying to do that that entire time, and I, like, knew it was happening, and I still, like, was letting it happen.
[137:31.71]Oh wow, I went out of stamina because I randomly hit the fucking grave.
[137:35.47]And now I can't stop him from resering his friend in one millisecond.
[137:39.20]Wait, what?
[137:39.70]Yeah, you see how fast that went?
[137:42.64]Wait, that guy's just alive again?
[137:45.48]Why is the equivalent of that guy like having a dead body in Diablo II to raise a skeleton?
[137:56.82]Holy shit, dude, you are like, you're doing so much work right now.
[138:01.53]Oh, he's still alive.
[138:08.95]I think they increased the speed you revive, because that's utter bullshit.
[138:12.35]It did not used to be that fast.
[138:17.58]This game is fucking awful.
[138:19.02]Yeah, they must have increased it, because that did not happen before.
[138:22.32]We lost.
[138:23.42]Right, this match?
[138:23.98]Yeah, you got it, Ubisoft.
[138:26.14]Fucking zero, and I couldn't even click it.
[138:35.31]And yeah, I don't know why there was no revenge knockback, because that whole game felt like shit.
[138:42.47]They both attacked for revenge and nothing happened.
[138:55.14]I'm going to give one more go with the raider.
[138:57.26]I feel like I'm getting sick of playing him over and over again, though.
[139:00.38]I want to play somebody else.
[139:08.97]That all wouldn't have happened either if my second part of that attack string didn't randomly hit the grave and remove all my stamina.
[139:14.89]Because then I would have been able to attack them fast enough.
[139:24.36]Is this the same people?
[139:25.58]I don't know.
[139:27.26]Maybe.
[139:28.50]I don't think so.
[139:29.62]What happened to the paint stream?
[139:31.02]What's going to happen?
[139:32.08]Get the fucking mouse serious.
[139:33.28]Oh my god, Ubisoft.
[140:03.06]Oh my god Ubisoft.
[140:05.66]Why was that their fault?
[140:17.31]What is this guy doing?
[140:49.22]I'll jump in with some jokey shit.
[140:51.34]He has a joke for you?
[140:52.84]Oh no, I can't.
[140:53.44]He's out of stamina.
[140:54.18]Fuck him up.
[140:54.86]Unblockables.
[140:57.16]I'm... I'm gonna... I can't.
[141:00.02]I can't.
[141:00.62]I just... I hate fighting against people that I don't know what they do.
[141:05.20]It's like too... It's so scary.
[141:07.02]I'm gonna die.
[141:09.85]It's like you need to learn every fucking move!
[141:18.08]It's like, everybody is so different.
[141:30.00]Jerma has really brilliant moments sometimes, and other times doesn't know right from left.
[141:34.73]Well, I mean, that's like how the first, I'd say, like, 10 to 20 hours of any, like, intensive, extremely difficult multiplayer game like this is.
[141:44.30]you should try it you have to up over and over again you have to do terrible dumb over over again to learn everything that's just the way it works and sometimes you have like brilliant like this is you have a brilliant moment like this sometimes
[142:25.02]Wait, what?
[142:27.40]We're both just out of stamina.
[142:28.66]I don't know why we're doing this.
[142:29.60]I don't know what the fuck.
[142:30.46]I gotta like fucking focus right now.
[142:31.76]Seriously, God.
[142:36.34]I'm just so... I'm just like so done.
[142:44.51]I like fucking can't do this anymore.
[142:48.48]What?
[142:49.56]I'm just like so impatient.
[142:51.44]I'm so fucking impatient.
[142:53.78]After I play a game like this for more than two hours, I just can't do it anymore.
[142:57.26]I can't play games for more than three hours.
[143:00.63]I just get so impatient and I'm just like done.
[143:02.11]When are you gonna grow up?
[143:06.99]Games that require this much intensive fucking thought, I can't do for more than a couple of hours.
[143:11.25]I really can't.
[143:15.27]Like, this is so, so fucking intense on the brain.
[143:21.33]I'm too old.
[143:25.25]We're just gonna fucking just cheese the fuck out of this guy.
[143:28.11]I'll get it eventually.
[143:29.23]I'm gonna get it eventually, buddy.
[143:32.60]I'll get it eventually.
[143:36.38]I'm like, I don't even care.
[143:39.02]I need to play a new character.
[143:41.28]Okay.
[143:42.02]Okay.
[143:42.64]Okay.
[143:43.06]We'll get you your tea.
[143:48.49]It's just so intense.
[143:50.87]There's so many things to learn and so many things to do.
[143:54.38]That after like a couple hours, I just need a break.
[143:57.06]I can't fucking do it.
[144:00.40]Okay, we'll give you a background.
[144:02.62]It'll be alright.
[144:03.24]Ugh.
[144:40.40]Unblockable, unblockable.
[144:42.10]I'm gonna die.
[144:51.99]Unblockable.
[144:52.97]The coach in the corner.
[145:03.68]Fuck this.
[145:08.62]I couldn't even rate it.
[145:11.77]Wait, what?
[145:12.91]What?
[145:14.53]Couldn't you?
[145:15.03]Oh, rate the game.
[145:19.69]Is that game over?
[145:21.21]No.
[145:22.67]No?
[145:23.03]No.
[145:23.61]Just keep going.
[145:27.23]Go, go, go.
[145:28.31]I want to have a fucking, I want to have a on-stream meltdown.
[145:31.39]Because guess what?
[145:33.18]It'll get posted, it'll be a viral video.
[145:36.17]You know what I mean?
[145:36.65]It'd be like, holy shit, dude, watch this dude freak out and talk.
[145:39.31]He just started screaming about all kinds of shit that had nothing to do with the game.
[145:43.70]You'd have to have a facecam for that.
[145:45.54]Yeah, okay, so next time I get, like, really, really mad, I'm gonna turn my facecam on and, like, SCREAM!
[145:50.40]And I'm gonna, like, SMASH A BOTTLE!
[145:51.86]And then it could be, like, posted, like, R. Yeah.
[145:55.27]Fucking fails.
[145:56.39]This dude failed so hard, he fucking screamed and smashed a bottle?! !
[146:07.06]Oh, we could go do a 1v1 after this so I could show you another character.
[146:10.34]Yeah, let's do that after this.
[146:11.79]But I mean, Shigoki isn't in the game, so...
[146:15.04]Holy shit, dude, this streamer, like, had a fucking meltdown.
[146:17.52]He was talking about how he, like, how he can't play this game for more than two hours and shit, and, like, he freaked the fuck out.
[146:23.52]And then he settled down, and then, like, he fought the spear lady.
[146:26.96]And she gave him, like, she flawlessed him, and this dude got in his car, and just, like, just drove to a different state.
[146:34.41]And then he turned the stream back on in another state.
[146:37.25]He was in, like, he was in, like, fucking Kentucky when he turned the stream back on.
[146:40.41]He got out of the car, he just poured gasoline all over his car.
[146:44.82]And fucking like torched it and just sat there laughing.
[146:47.53]Like what the fuck dude?
[146:48.61]Fucking fail.
[146:49.25]What a fail.
[147:13.66]I just don't know what he's doing.
[147:14.66]This fucking mouse is on my- I'm about to go with a drive to fucking Kentucky!
[147:18.82]Get this fucking mouse off my screen, Ubisoft!
[147:21.32]God, streamer fails and streamer fucking screamed!
[147:25.02]Get the fuck off my screen.
[147:26.35]Oh my god.
[147:32.57]Is there a reason why, after every fucking single game, you have to put my mouse in the center of the screen?
[147:38.33]Do you have to put my mouse on this every fucking single game?
[147:49.16]Oh god That was so stupid Round two.
[148:07.06]Oh, she's about to break your mouth on the screen Alright, fuck this this guy's dead What was that move
[148:21.15]What's going on?
[148:21.61]What's happening?
[148:22.01]Why am I burning?
[148:25.72]Um, hold on.
[148:26.54]You tell me... Hold on.
[148:27.42]You tell me the fucking stupid geyser pops out.
[148:30.24]There's a geyser in this game.
[148:32.32]And it hurts you.
[148:34.90]Yeah.
[148:35.74]What?
[148:36.83]What the fuck?
[148:39.01]I'm so mad right now at that.
[148:42.25]How was I fucking supposed to know that?
[148:43.79]That was gonna happen.
[148:44.43]It's like a fucking fountain.
[148:50.52]Oh my god.
[149:00.74]See you in Kentucky, dude.
[149:05.62]How did you win?
[149:06.20]What?
[149:06.42]I don't know.
[149:12.08]I beat that guy.
[149:12.69]Do you see how good I just did?
[149:15.67]I won it for him.
[149:23.07]This guy's playing Conqueror and didn't even block.
[149:26.22]Oh no!
[149:26.64]Did you just go over here and put batteries in that for me?
[149:31.72]I thought that was unblockable.
[149:35.82]What?
[149:36.06]Wasn't that supposed to be not blockable?
[149:38.36]It's parryable.
[149:39.79]And this guy is actually parrying.
[149:42.03]I just want to learn a new character.
[149:42.95]I'm done.
[149:44.49]Before I get in a fucking car and drive like 200 miles per hour across the country.
[150:01.82]Oh god.
[150:05.40]Dude, I'm just gonna go photocopy my ass 3000 times.
[150:11.90]I'm just going to Times Square and just fucking 52 pick up into the air and just run.
[150:20.97]Aww.
[150:22.53]No, fuck that.
[150:23.09]I'm gonna get 20,000 Xerox copies of my ass.
[150:28.07]And I'm gonna put it in the back of a fucking station wagon.
[150:31.20]And I'm going to slightly open up the back of the station wagon.
[150:35.00]And drive, like, down the road.
[150:36.98]So... And I'll just be, like, fucking painting the street with pictures of my ass.
[150:46.83]Just... The back of the car is going to be open just enough...
[151:08.19]And the whole time I'm gonna be blasting like Queen.
[151:10.45]So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye?
[151:20.16]So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye?
[151:34.24]I just wanna do a photocopy!
[151:35.72]I just wanna photocopy 20,000 copies of my ass!
[151:37.38]What are we doing?
[151:38.80]I'm not doing any of the things you're doing.
[152:05.70]I just want to point that out.
[152:08.19]You say, we, like... Oh, man.
[152:18.91]I'm not doing any of the things that you're doing.
[152:24.72]The Jerm has lost it.
[152:25.52]No, I'm just fucking exhausted.
[152:28.30]Mental break?
[152:30.78]No, this ain't a mental break, no.
[152:33.18]This is a mental...
[152:37.19]This is scarier than Resident Evil.
[152:46.66]Now teach me a new character.
[152:49.18]Let's go relax.
[152:50.52]Let's go take a breather.
[152:56.90]I tried.
[152:58.50]I tried.
[152:58.74]Alright, teach me a new character.
[153:07.30]Okay.
[153:11.00]Do you guys want a mouse on your screen?
[153:13.76]Out of here.
[153:23.89]So who should I learn to play?
[153:26.51]I don't know, Jeremy.
[153:28.37]Go to a smoke break for fuck's sake.
[153:31.33]This game is so, like...
[153:34.38]Do you get this way too?
[153:35.16]Do you feel like your whole body like, do you want to just like explode?
[153:39.34]Yes!
[153:39.81]Yeah, okay, good.
[153:41.35]I'm just making sure that I'm not the only one.
[153:42.47]I just accidentally backed out of this menu and I have to reset up the 1v1 options all over again.
[153:47.73]Like, I feel like if you came over here right now and you took like a small pin and you just like, like poked me right in the shoulder, blood and guts and I would, it would explode.
[153:59.51]It would be a fucking crime scene.
[154:01.71]It would just be like, boo!
[154:12.61]I don't know.
[154:13.03]You probably fought everyone at this point.
[154:15.81]Who seemed appealing.
[154:18.78]And it's the little things.
[154:20.04]It's the mouse being on the screen and shit.
[154:21.90]When you're playing and you're getting your ass kicked and stuff, right?
[154:25.36]Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.
[154:26.68]It always is the little things in this game add up to make you want to just explode.
[154:32.85]And, like, this, like, mouse being on the screen is making me, like, irrationally upset.
[154:39.19]Like, get off.
[154:40.56]Like, it's making me irrational.
[154:42.48]You've got 20 seconds to pick, man.
[154:45.22]It came back.
[154:46.00]It came back.
[154:47.28]It's doing this on purpose now.
[154:49.88]What's... Peacekeeper?
[154:52.32]No.
[154:53.26]Berserker.
[155:01.89]I don't know anything about Berserker.
[155:04.58]That was what Arcanum played the whole time, though, so I know what you do, I just don't know how you do it.
[155:08.36]It's the Uplay overlay.
[155:14.10]Alright, let me see.
[155:18.71]Get off my screen, please.
[155:23.73]They're doing it, it's happening on purpose.
[155:25.25]Alright, let's see.
[155:27.14]A big thing with Berserker is you have...
[155:31.00]deflection, and your dashes are much better.
[155:33.72]So you're not dashing much on Raider, but the dashes for the assassin characters are really good.
[155:37.72]I think you get a deflection.
[155:39.67]So she had like a three-hit combo there.
[155:44.21]So this can just be used indefinitely, okay.
[155:51.37]You get some sort of whirlwind move, but I don't know how to initiate it.
[155:55.15]L3 and R2 is a bear rush?
[155:59.05]Let's see here.
[156:05.41]Oh, and I think the other very important thing is you can't have a block up forever.
[156:09.68]Your blocks time out.
[156:11.36]So if you look and you go to block, it'll... Oh, shit.
[156:15.92]Oh, sh... Can you do a heavy side attack to me?
[156:22.99]Do it again.
[156:34.70]My game crashed.
[156:36.42]Not playing that guy.
[156:37.56]Nope.
[156:39.65]Yeah, my game is completely broken.
[156:41.79]You know, I'm gonna go.
[156:42.97]No, no, you can't go.
[156:43.95]I can't?
[156:45.63]No, you have to teach me one more character and you can go.
[156:50.77]I'm gonna play as the... one of the knights.
[156:56.39]Teach you warden.
[156:57.91]The warden's very... Who else is on the knights?
[157:03.16]I don't know anything about Conqueror.
[157:04.74]They seem to suck.
[157:05.78]No, no Conqueror.
[157:08.70]What's the other one?
[157:09.32]What is the other one?
[157:12.08]Peacekeeper.
[157:13.24]That has the same kind of block, though.
[157:15.74]Hmm.
[157:21.43]Hmm.
[157:21.55]Not that bad.
[157:22.53]I want to learn one of the Samurais.
[157:25.79]Re-invite me.
[157:30.98]After this, I'm not going to stream for that much longer anyways.
[157:34.36]A lot of the characters are pretty complicated.
[157:36.88]Kensei as well as... Kind of weird.
[157:43.15]I don't know anything about Orochi, though.
[157:44.33]They just kind of do attacks very often.
[157:46.85]I'm going to pick Orochi.
[157:49.31]They might also have the same block.
[157:51.07]Well, that's alright.
[157:51.99]I will not quit out of the game.
[157:54.09]Or maybe I'll do Kensei.
[157:55.63]I could teach you Peacekeeper.
[157:56.57]They're pretty straightforward.
[157:57.57]Alright, we'll do Peacekeeper.
[158:00.15]Okay, I'm inviting you.
[158:02.16]I hope you don't leave and crash my game.
[158:04.60]I probably will.
[158:05.30]Okay, good to know.
[158:12.52]Oh my god.
[158:13.12]Oh, okay.
[158:18.23]I almost got him.
[158:21.31]Long story.
[158:22.75]Long story.
[158:25.53]You had to fight your commander, right?
[158:28.42]um I don't think I even did that maybe I did it was just asking me to do it oh yeah I don't think I even actually did that can't wait for the Kentucky stream I don't even remember what I said someone's gonna have to like tell me what I said I don't remember what it was hey thanks for the 12 months man dj
[158:53.09]Thank you, everybody, for, uh, what are you doing?
[158:56.61]I didn't go back.
[158:57.29]I didn't pick a side, did I?
[158:59.37]Pick a side.
[159:00.25]You're on the right side.
[159:00.91]There's only one side.
[159:01.73]It'll auto-sight at you.
[159:02.94]Oh, okay.
[159:04.38]Uh, so who was it?
[159:05.18]Peacekeeper?
[159:06.76]Yeah.
[159:13.45]Wait, I said I was gonna get photocopies of my ass?
[159:17.07]When did I say that?
[159:28.32]I had a meltdown.
[159:32.60]Alright, alright, alright.
[159:34.14]Alright.
[159:37.14]Alright.
[159:39.06]So let's see here.
[159:41.02]OK.
[159:42.06]Come over here and do a heavy side attack to me.
[159:49.17]I'm messing it up.
[159:52.13]Okay, if you dodge into attack at the right time from the correct direction, that's a deflection.
[159:58.52]It's kind of like parrying, but you have to dodge into it.
[160:00.78]It's a lot harder for me.
[160:04.44]But Peacekeeper gets to follow up after that, so they get like a... I think it's if you right bumper.
[160:10.91]After doing that, you get a stab.
[160:12.81]If someone's doing an overhead attack, you have to dash into the attack.
[160:17.05]Okay.
[160:17.45]Which is very scary.
[160:19.01]Yeah.
[160:19.75]But it's pretty much the same thing as the timing with parries.
[160:22.83]You can still parry, but you also... Alright, so if you do a light or heavy swing to me, no matter what, if I dash towards the swing at the right time, then I will do that move.
[160:35.51]Alright, let me check something.
[160:42.23]Yeah, and after that, if you press right bumper, you automatically get a stab in the person's side.
[160:46.01]So I'm gonna do heavy side attacks to you, and you can try it.
[160:48.95]Alright?
[160:49.45]Yep.
[160:50.41]You have to be close enough to me for a date.
[160:51.88]I don't have very far reach.
[160:52.94]Okay.
[160:55.76]Yeah.
[160:56.12]Like, right as you- it has to be very fastly input.
[161:01.06]Oh, that's fucking awesome.
[161:01.98]Well, yeah, you got it for the first one.
[161:05.56]Confirm better than me at it.
[161:07.78]Um, the other big thing is when you grab somebody... Mm-hmm.
[161:13.14]You get three right bumpers, but you have to time them.
[161:16.50]It's like right, right, right.
[161:18.72]You can't, you can't, yeah, it's insane.
[161:22.74]It's right bumper after you grab someone, but you have to time each attack.
[161:26.80]I feel like you only did one there.
[161:27.84]So what do you have to go like one, two, three?
[161:30.24]Yeah.
[161:33.80]This character's fucking awesome.
[161:34.90]I'm dead.
[161:36.42]Yeah, you are.
[161:39.95]Now you're super dead.
[161:43.57]okay interesting anything else uh yeah okay wait until I'm not dead anymore yeah yeah yeah round three uh how do you do that thingy let me check
[162:10.09]Now, for me to do that move, do I have to have, because you notice how when you are in a block for long enough, it goes away, like for this character too?
[162:18.44]Yeah.
[162:18.76]Do I have to be in the white for that dodge parry move to work, or no?
[162:26.19]You don't have to block at all to do the deflect.
[162:28.51]Okay, so it's just the dodge.
[162:30.95]Okay.
[162:31.67]Yeah, I don't know if like I had to have my like, you know in the white You know how it is Yeah, but the white thing isn't that big of a deal because when you see an attack coming you kind of naturally Get ready and it lasts for long enough that you'll block whatever you're trying to block, right?
[162:45.21]another simple thing is you dash forward and heavy attack and
[162:51.16]Not that dash, like the actual just press A to dash forward.
[162:54.85]Yeah, you get that jump forward poke.
[162:57.39]That'll get you forward on a lot of characters.
[162:59.98]But people look forward often and try and parry it.
[163:02.14]Wardens always try and parry it.
[163:06.68]Um, bup bup bup bup.
[163:08.56]You can do any heavy attack.
[163:10.71]If you press right attack while you're doing the heavy, you'll do a poison stab instead.
[163:15.29]So wait, at any point during the he- If you do a heavy attack, during the heavy attack, you press right attack, you'll do a- you'll cancel the heavy and do a- a poison stab.
[163:25.04]Ooh!
[163:25.28]Oh, that is such bullshit!
[163:32.55]That's so fucked up.
[163:35.59]That's so crazy.
[163:37.18]She's probably one of the strongest dual characters in the game right now just because of how much damage she can do.
[163:42.10]But a lot of players are really good at countering grabs.
[163:45.26]That's why I was so... Like, she was going for swings and then... Like, it just... I couldn't time it.
[163:51.61]I think there might be a weird bug right now.
[163:53.49]Hold on, let me try against you.
[163:55.13]I heard people talk about...
[164:02.13]That's like super, super effective.
[164:04.67]Being able to have like a fake out and have it still attack and do poison.
[164:07.71]Get up onto level ground.
[164:17.08]Yeah.
[164:18.14]Someone told me that you can do the heavy attack and right as the heavy attack hits you can cancel into the poison dagger.
[164:23.64]But I've never done it.
[164:32.23]Let me see if I'm forgetting anything What her basic mess really is r1 r1 r2 r1 r2 r2 r2
[164:47.24]Her heavy swings are all really kind of slow.
[164:51.37]Yeah, they are.
[164:52.25]A lot of things about her are pretty slow.
[164:53.93]It's mostly just about the little like... Yeah.
[164:57.47]You want to get like... Okay.
[164:59.25]Then back away and then like... Got it.
[165:04.64]Alright, let's try again.
[165:08.04]Let's do it.
[165:11.32]Fight me once.
[165:12.76]For real?
[165:13.56]Get used to it, yeah.
[165:14.62]Okay.
[165:17.42]And then I'll play, like, a round or two, and then I'm gonna get out of here.
[165:28.82]Oh, actually, I practiced this one time.
[165:30.84]Yeah.
[165:31.49]When I do a heavy overhead, you have to dash into it.
[165:34.11]It's scary, but you have to do it.
[165:37.25]There you go.
[165:38.21]Okay.
[165:38.67]Do it again.
[165:43.11]Okay.
[165:45.32]Alright, ready to go?
[165:47.74]Yep, let's do it.
[165:52.11]That shouldn't have happened because I was mid-swing, but the game sucks sometimes.
[165:57.45]Okay, we're done.
[166:02.69]Okay, let's go.
[166:03.41]Let's play.
[166:06.35]Let's get to a real game.
[166:09.33]2v2 or the big one?
[166:11.07]Do the big one first so I can get a feel for it.
[166:13.46]And while you do that, I'm going to pee.
[166:15.06]I'll be right back.
[166:40.01]Did he go pee-pee?
[167:30.44]Not bad, pretty good.
[167:59.42]Alright.
[168:02.18]What happened?
[168:02.58]I see a roachy squad.
[168:04.48]Oh god.
[168:05.09]I heard some loud people everywhere.
[168:06.81]Did you?
[168:07.87]Yeah.
[168:08.75]Pretty typical.
[168:09.23]Yeah, I'll do this and I'll do, um, like, one 2v2.
[168:16.23]Let's just see.
[168:17.68]If we're having fun, we'll do another couple, you know.
[168:23.62]Why is this taking so long?
[168:25.22]I have no idea.
[168:26.10]We've been here for a while.
[168:30.97]I'm not gonna say I'd be a weirdo if I were a newbie.
[168:44.66]Wait, what?
[168:50.24]Wait, what?
[168:53.60]This is my practice round.
[168:56.33]We have the advantage!
[169:00.57]I'm hitting like square.
[169:02.03]Why am I hitting square to fight this person?
[169:28.92]You know, I'm so used to hitting square that hitting X is changing my whole life.
[169:43.71]Oh, the other weird thing about this game mode that took me a long time to realize is if you're standing in a capture point, you're earning more points.
[169:50.03]Really?
[169:50.65]But you also heal for standing in them.
[169:52.56]But yeah, you earn more points just for being in them.
[169:54.38]Dude, I'm going to jump off the top rope on this guy.
[169:59.54]See this guy right here?
[170:04.27]I keep coming over and seeing you do that.
[170:08.59]Somebody's following you.
[170:10.17]Trap him.
[170:11.51]They're just being chased.
[170:30.43]You want to go to that to the low-health boy, but Yeah, so is it is it our what when you get the stab stab stab in the stomach is it our one artist heavier like our one it's like One of our people bugged on the ladder
[171:04.04]Alright.
[171:04.58]Oh, there's someone to jump on for sure down here.
[171:09.53]I don't see anybody.
[171:12.77]They're all, like, over here.
[171:13.53]Got him.
[171:14.19]Got one.
[171:14.63]Are you serious?
[171:15.79]We got one on the ladder.
[171:18.79]I've done that so many times.
[171:25.37]I need some good, like, 1v1 experience.
[171:27.18]Okay, here we go.
[171:30.36]Why do we do 4v4 modes, dummy?
[171:35.14]I'm not doing that right.
[171:41.10]I keep hitting R2 instead of R1.
[171:50.94]I'm getting the deflections, but I'm not following up because I'm pressing R2.
[171:55.52]I don't know why, but I did that for a while, too.
[171:59.35]For some reason, it feels like I need to hit the trigger button, not the bumper.
[172:05.86]I feel like after a little while, I will like this character, though.
[172:09.70]It's really not that complicated.
[172:11.74]It's just a lot of timing-based stuff.
[172:14.06]And it's quite good.
[172:15.50]But who would have thought all these shitty Oki players were this bad?
[172:36.17]God, it's a whole nother game.
[172:40.65]Just when I was trying to start to learn how to play Raider, it's time to learn the entire fucking game again.
[172:48.91]Whatever, I'm doing it.
[172:50.15]You gotta do it.
[173:20.21]Hmm.
[173:49.11]That's actually a lot more difficult than I thought it was gonna be.
[173:52.08]The deflection?
[173:53.00]Yeah, just because not only do you have to get in the right position, but you have to deflect it too.
[173:56.82]It's not just like a block.
[174:00.00]Quite tricky.
[174:01.34]I get it.
[174:01.68]I'll figure it out.
[174:04.30]Just need 10,000 hours, right?
[174:05.66]Yeah, guys, if you want to know how to do anything, it's 10,000 hours, and then you're good at it.
[174:14.73]I'm going to C.
[174:28.48]I don't know how this is such an even game.
[174:31.16]Because I'm spending this entire game trying to learn how to do parries.
[174:36.81]I have not fought a person.
[174:39.21]I'm just trying to learn parries.
[174:40.89]I have not fought one person.
[174:45.19]I'm just walking over people.
[174:58.85]block.
[174:59.66]I'm just trying to learn parries.
[175:01.02]I'm not... No.
[175:03.12]No blocking.
[175:03.80]I need to learn how to do that move.
[175:08.56]You captured Zone C.
[175:22.25]Oh, there are two again.
[175:23.09]Fuck me.
[175:23.91]Goddammit, that's so difficult.
[175:36.58]You know, maybe this was not a good idea to play this game mode.
[175:40.01]Because I'm not like learning anything, I'm just like getting killed.
[175:52.79]I know that when I see red, that's the block guy.
[175:56.05]I've been playing this game for three hours now, man.
[175:57.79]I know that.
[175:59.81]I'm not trying to... I'm trying to do this, like, deflection and shit.
[176:06.17]No!
[176:08.79]You captured John Cena.
[176:26.88]Maybe they might be saying there actually is a flash of the red, which is the proper timing for it.
[176:38.34]But I, in all my time, really don't look at that.
[176:46.27]Learning sucks.
[176:50.86]Use the L-stick to move.
[176:54.01]Wait, what?
[176:54.49]Holy shit.
[176:54.73]I thought it was something else.
[176:57.99]Alright, fucking instant play.
[177:00.11]Like, I'll figure it out.
[177:01.15]That's for, like, duels and shit.
[177:06.88]I'm not gonna try to do that anymore.
[177:19.32]Yeah, a nicer thing in Dominion is that people kind of play, um... They try and play quickly and they forget, like, the basics and all the things that they want to actually be doing.
[177:33.83]And it's really easy for a lot of Peacekeepers to just run up and grab people.
[177:39.55]Which is their big damage dealer, anyway.
[177:41.15]There are no bats for us!
[177:55.33]Oh, that's a health aura he put down.
[177:59.28]Who's left?
[178:02.88]They only have one guy left.
[178:04.57]On B.
[178:21.23]I want to see my score.
[178:23.69]I didn't do anything.
[178:25.85]I was trying to deflect attacks.
[178:28.15]Oh well.
[178:31.24]What the fuck were you just running around killing people?
[178:34.28]Yeah.
[178:36.10]I might have been killing some dudes.
[178:38.30]Let's do 2v2.
[178:40.40]I feel like I can learn the character actually if I can pay attention to what's going on around me.
[178:55.47]It seems like any fight with more than two people turns into like a, yeah, it's like a shit fest.
[179:02.70]Yeah, just queue us up in 2v2.
[179:04.22]Try it again.
[179:04.56]Okay.
[179:06.34]Uh, here we go.
[179:06.94]I hope you're ready to carry because it's gonna take me a little while to learn this motherfucker.
[179:12.19]Fine.
[179:14.61]Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[179:16.11]Wait, what?
[179:23.27]Recruit.
[179:35.41]You sense the next stream starting in around 3 hours and 8 minutes?
[179:38.91]What?
[179:41.65]I'm streaming at like fucking 1 o'clock in the morning tonight?
[179:45.47]Hey, didn't you say you were in an art stream or something?
[179:48.13]Yeah, it was just... There's like a bunch of stupid jokes that I have set up that it's gonna take a little while.
[179:54.09]Oh, I thought that was tonight.
[179:55.47]It was going to be, but... I need to go back to the art store and get a few more things.
[179:59.83]It's gonna be one of those things.
[180:05.13]Alright, here we go.
[180:06.79]Get your failfishes ready.
[180:07.83]Get your laugh emotes ready.
[180:09.77]Because, like, get ready to laugh at me.
[180:14.40]Wait, what?
[180:16.10]What's going on here?
[180:23.67]Alright, where's the laugh emotes?
[180:26.15]I didn't even attack that.
[180:31.19]I didn't swing my sword.
[180:33.53]One fucking time.
[180:34.55]I'm out of stamina.
[180:38.41]I'm out of stamina.
[181:03.41]much on deflecting oh I'm trying to learn how to do it like I'm willing to lose a hundred games in a row oh my goodness I almost got what the fuck was that okay that guy was just seriously what is going on what the fuck is going on
[181:33.54]Okay.
[181:35.33]Alright.
[181:54.45]I can't play this character right now.
[181:55.83]I need to spend time off stream and play the game a bunch of times.
[181:59.13]I can't.
[181:59.45]It's just too much to have to learn in front of a bunch of people that are going to make fucking fun of you!
[182:16.53]What happened?
[182:17.03]I started playing a character I don't know how to play and it was a mistake.
[182:25.54]Can you hurt them?
[182:26.70]I can win the 2v1 if that guy is, like, hurt.
[182:32.44]Just focus on getting one hit in.
[182:33.50]Alright, fucking, I'm just, let's go.
[182:35.28]This is fucking, ah, I'm getting in that fucking car in a few seconds, dude.
[182:39.72]Oh, I told you!
[183:08.52]Try I'm trying as hard as I can to learn Oh God, I'm about to get from Russia Oh
[183:34.49]What he's doing actually did something.
[183:39.03]I can't, like... Let's try it again.
[183:43.12]Go again?
[183:47.02]Go again.
[183:47.44]Like, you can't learn unless you fucking do it!
[183:49.12]Like, don't you guys understand?
[183:50.18]What, do you guys expect me to turn my stream on and play a character I've never played before and, like, know how to play this fucking game?
[183:57.27]Like, this character?
[184:00.25]That's too much pressure.
[184:18.92]What?
[184:20.92]I'm ascending.
[184:29.59]Yes, you casual.
[184:31.95]Ban that guy for life.
[184:33.05]For real.
[184:33.51]Like, give the guy the first real full full ban that I've ever given.
[184:38.59]Ban that guy fucking fu- I don't ever want to see that guy again.
[184:40.47]Damn.
[184:49.40]You know, just turn the chat off.
[184:50.42]I don't want to know.
[184:52.47]Turn off the chat.
[184:53.75]Keep it off.
[184:54.25]No, don't do that.
[185:00.68]I'm kidding.
[185:29.70]I ran out of stamina there.
[185:37.20]Hey, you might get bum-rushed.
[185:43.81]Everyone's bum-rushing today.
[185:44.97]You probably would have done it by now, though.
[186:01.58]He got revenge.
[186:02.32]I thought I fucking killed him!
[186:04.48]Hold on, I fucking brought that guy's health to zero.
[186:08.20]You can cancel out of literally anything with revenge mode.
[186:12.39]So mid grab, he probably had one health.
[186:14.53]That dude, I stabbed him three times with zero health.
[186:17.11]And then he pressed triangle and got all his health back and couldn't kill him.
[186:19.99]Round two.
[186:21.54]What?
[186:22.42]Why is that in the fucking game?
[186:24.76]What the fuck is the point of that?
[186:25.90]No, explain that to me.
[186:27.16]Ubisoft, I want an employee to explain that to me.
[186:28.94]Hey, would you like an explanation?
[186:30.32]They added that mechanic into the game to help you win against multiple enemies.
[186:38.88]And yet he was able to build revenge in a 1v1.
[186:45.54]How the fuck am I gonna beat this motherfucker, seriously?
[186:54.78]That is so fucking stupid.
[186:58.00]I'm actually angry at how fucking dumb that is.
[187:02.30]Me and this guy, 1v1 in a fight.
[187:05.12]I ended up winning the fight, but he pressed triangle.
[187:08.30]So he gets fucking half his health back in the blows.
[187:12.76]Fucking fire the guy at Ubisoft that made that.
[187:15.96]In fact, fire him and fire his family too.
[187:19.43]Go find out where they work and get them fired.
[187:21.13]Fire the whole family.
[187:30.60]Like, I fucking- I beat that guy.
[187:32.68]I won that fucking duel.
[187:34.46]Isn't this a game about duels, not about, like, fucking super saiyan-ing triangle?
[187:37.82]See, look what you just did.
[187:45.42]Yeah, I'm doing it only because he did it.
[187:47.89]Otherwise, I wouldn't.
[187:49.67]Damn.
[188:02.66]Dermot, it's a good game.
[188:04.54]It's a really good game that you want to love, but it has a lot of significant, very obvious flaws that someone who has played the game for two hours can recognize, even though they've been developing the game for years.
[188:44.09]I should have just killed this guy.
[188:56.88]I felt bad for him when I took it easy.
[188:58.56]I'm dead.
[189:10.39]Something about bleed damage as well on Peacekeeper makes people get revenge really fast.
[189:16.87]I don't know why.
[189:17.39]Maybe it's because it's ticking over and over again and hitting them a lot.
[189:19.93]But I've noticed a lot of times that's the case.
[189:32.94]Dude, you can't even criticize it though because it's open beta.
[189:38.22]I think I hate this game.
[189:42.08]But the question is, do you want to play again?
[189:44.85]Yes.
[189:58.45]We won like eight fucking games in a row.
[190:02.56]We did.
[190:03.30]And now it's just like shoving a hot iron up my ass playing this game.
[190:10.94]Like I'm sitting on like, you know like the cow branding thing?
[190:15.27]Somebody's branding my ass and it's an Ubisoft logo.
[190:19.29]The CEO of Ubisoft is just smoking a cigar like, Yeah, you're gonna play again.
[190:26.36]Now you got the logo on ya.
[190:27.82]And I'm just like, goddammit.
[190:33.78]It's really a shame, because... Like, a few more months of polish, I think they could figure all this shit out.
[190:42.55]But the game launches in three days.
[190:47.57]It's a good game.
[190:48.85]I like it.
[190:49.21]I just, like... It's just so... It's so frustrating.
[190:54.43]I don't know if that's a combination of the game being, like, just extremely challenging, like, 1v1 dueling type game, or if, like, the fact that you can press triangle and get your health back is, like, in it.
[191:05.05]Well, it's an extremely challenging timing-based dueling game with peer-to-peer matchmaking.
[191:10.85]Oh, right.
[191:29.29]Damn it.
[191:29.61]I'm trying to fucking deflect stuff.
[191:32.02]I'm done.
[191:32.34]I quit.
[191:34.00]I'm fucking done.
[191:39.36]That was it?
[191:40.50]I'm fucking out of here.
[191:45.43]Fuck this game.
[191:46.41]Fuck E.T.
[191:47.83]Fuck Ubisoft.
[191:48.65]I'm...
[191:57.58]Fuck this guy.
[191:58.42]This guy's not a player.
[191:59.38]Fuck this guy.
[192:04.02]Fuck Nintendo, too, you know.
[192:06.08]Oh, the Switch?
[192:06.76]Fuck Microsoft.
[192:08.14]Fuck Sony.
[192:09.76]Fuck Valve.
[192:10.43]Fuck all of them.
[192:12.17]I'll never play another game in the rest of my life.
[192:16.21]Except for right now.
[192:22.61]He's coming to you.
[192:23.07]For some reason.
[192:44.20]I'm so... I'm done.
[192:45.52]I'm fucking done.
[192:53.65]You know what game company I'm not going to say fuck you to?
[192:59.53]Lionhead Studios.
[193:00.73]Because they made the movies.
[193:01.89]The best game ever made.
[193:09.11]How could you not see that happening?
[193:10.33]Because I don't fucking care anymore!
[193:12.22]Like, that's how!
[193:14.40]I'm just not playing correctly.
[193:27.95]And I'm just... on... I'm... seriously, you know those coin dozer machines?
[193:33.66]At like fucking Dave and Buster's.
[193:34.84]You know the ones they're talking about.
[193:36.80]You put the coins in and it's like... It pushes the coins and you're trying to get...
[193:43.76]I'm just gonna talk because I don't give a fuck about that.
[193:46.33]So, uh, those coin dozers that you put the coins in and it pushes shit over.
[193:51.73]Like, if you touch those machines, if you even remotely move them at all, it makes a fucking alarm and you'll get, like, thrown out.
[193:59.67]Right?
[194:00.22]You'll get thrown out.
[194:01.54]Because you'll be cheating.
[194:02.52]You're, like, trying to... Like, I just dumped the whole machine forward and every coin fell into the slot.
[194:12.42]Oh, what?
[194:13.08]I was... fucking... Dumbass game.
[194:25.43]I'm just going... I'm running out of stamina.
[194:27.03]Who cares?
[194:27.33]I'm fucking spamming R2.
[194:28.67]I don't even give a fuck.
[194:30.88]This guy will eventually fucking run out of stamina.
[194:38.20]Don't even, like, just get me out of the game.
[194:40.76]How do I get out as fast as I can?
[194:41.92]Just, just, hey, just chill.
[194:43.68]What do I do?
[194:43.96]How do I get out of here?
[194:44.82]Get me out, quick, get me out.
[194:47.60]Actually, the AIs in this game are really good.
[194:49.24]Maybe you should quit.
[194:57.84]To be completely honest.
[195:01.48]It's a good game.
[195:02.26]It's fun.
[195:03.12]I like it.
[195:04.20]But I have to play these games in small doses or they will drive me insane.
[195:11.83]I can't play games like this for more than a couple hours.
[195:14.03]Otherwise, I will shit my pants in rage.
[195:19.22]I'm not even rage.
[195:20.12]I haven't really even been mad or angry.
[195:23.43]I've just been frustrated.
[195:26.19]I've been frustrated.
[195:27.61]That guy just got five times better in the course of the last duel.
[195:33.80]You have to take these games in small doses.
[195:43.92]Because you get to that point when you're learning something and then you just kind of don't... You just forget and you're making your muscle memories not doing the things you're supposed to be doing.
[195:54.23]At the very beginning of the stream, those first ten rounds, I was learning, but now I'm just like, I don't even know which way is right and left.
[196:03.00]I may as well be just a fucking sack of potatoes right now.
[196:08.10]Like, I don't...
[196:23.86]My brain is so tuned out of this game at this point.
[196:28.85]I would rather stream me burning eggs.
[196:30.99]Don't you dare try and res that guy.
[196:56.52]Alright, I think that's time to... I have to get Jerma his tea.
[197:00.31]I have to get him his supper.
[197:01.49]Get me my dinner.
[197:03.63]Get me my supper.
[197:07.89]Don't look at the score, anyone.
[197:08.89]Fuck E.T.
[197:10.55]Alright, on the count of three, Star, thanks for playing.
[197:12.73]Thanks for hanging out, dude.
[197:13.75]On the count of three, I want you to say, fuck E.T., okay?
[197:17.54]One, two, three.
[197:19.08]Fuck E.T.
[197:19.32]Fuck E.T.
[197:25.33]no no zero five I know guys I cashed out I cashed out like okay let's let's go let's talk about this for a second like 30 minutes into the stream trying to learn like two the the two hour middle chunk was playing alright was doing k playing the raider did we won a bunch of games in a row
[197:47.15]Like, once I got past that first game, like, once we did the first game with Peacekeeper, cashed out.
[197:52.37]Like, I was just, I burnt out.
[197:53.95]Cashed out.
[197:54.79]You can't try and learn a new character that quick.
[197:57.62]Cashed out.
[197:57.98]Not a good idea.
[197:59.78]And when I cashed out, it wasn't even that much money.
[198:03.78]It was like fucking $34.
[198:04.66]I cashed out like $400, man.
[198:08.34]Yeah, I know you cashed out $400, I cashed out $40.
[198:12.22]Like, you were playing, you were racking up money, right?
[198:14.87]You're getting kills, getting kills, getting kills, getting money, like $10 a kill, $10 a kill, you made a bunch of money.
[198:19.79]Me?
[198:21.45]I, I mean, I could kill here or there, gonna win here or there, cashing up, cashing up, $40, $30, $50?
[198:27.34]Cash out.
[198:28.04]I'm out.
[198:29.62]Learning the Peacekeeper, you're back at zero.
[198:30.98]I don't want to owe the casino any money.
[198:33.40]I'm not going to owe the casino money.
[198:35.12]And now I do.
[198:35.68]And now I lost my $40.
[198:37.30]I've gotten the point that you're trying to make for the last 30 minutes.
[198:40.12]30 minutes ago, I already knew what you're talking about.
[198:52.19]Yeah, I know.
[198:53.91]Just making sure they do.
[198:55.60]Just making sure they do.
[198:57.08]Okay.
[199:02.69]But yeah, thanks a lot for hanging out, guys.
[199:04.87]Someone just wrote, what the fuck are you talking about?
[199:06.59]I don't know, man.
[199:07.49]You're gonna have to go through it again.
[199:09.61]Alright, so pretty much, when you get killed, I've started playing the game.
[199:14.81]No, I, uh... The game is fun.
[199:20.72]There you go.
[199:21.30]There you go, Ubisoft.
[199:22.26]That's what you'll get from me.
[199:24.52]That's what you'll get from me, Ubisoft.
[199:26.00]The game is fun.
[199:26.72]That's all you're getting.
[199:36.32]Alright, so the paint stream, the creative stream is probably going to be soon.
[199:40.50]I don't know.
[199:41.04]It depends on when I can get it ready.
[199:43.82]I want it to be today, but there was a lot of other things that we were going to do.
[199:49.02]And then, I don't know, start tomorrow.
[199:50.08]Didn't you say that you want to play Overwatch?
[199:51.57]Tomorrow?
[199:52.57]Well, are you available when I start streaming?
[199:56.83]I'll be available like same time.
[199:57.99]Like around like 7 o'clock.
[200:00.07]Oh, jeez.
[200:02.29]How about you just play Overwatch for like a couple hours and then I'll just jump on and we can just both do whatever.
[200:07.03]I'll see if I can do something with my life.
[200:12.44]Yeah.
[200:14.16]But everybody say bye to Star.
[200:16.54]Thanks for hanging out, Star.
[200:17.42]It's good to see you again.
[200:18.34]Oh, bye.
[200:18.57]Good to hang out with you.
[200:19.51]Long time no see.
[200:20.69]Well, I'll see you tomorrow, man.
[200:23.19]Bitch.
[200:24.63]Alright, he's gone.
[200:26.81]Uh, yeah, that was fun.
[200:27.91]My final thoughts on the game, obviously, after the half-joking stream.
[200:33.50]I mean, obviously, I was frustrated for a little bit.
[200:35.04]But, like, I'm just... I was just messing around.
[200:38.50]Look, guys, don't you know that you can just say, no matter what you do or say, you can just say, guys, I was just messing around.
[200:45.79]And everyone's gonna go, oh, okay, he was just messing around.
[200:48.37]That's fine.
[200:51.48]But there are people that gave some money earlier.
[200:53.22]I want to make sure I say hello to them.
[200:54.32]It was during that whole thing.
[200:57.09]Chili, thanks for the $5.
[200:57.85]Do gooder.
[200:59.89]I will try.
[201:01.63]Chili also said do good for $5.
[201:03.59]Thanks a lot, Chili.
[201:06.11]And Nairo.
[201:08.77]Thank you, Nairo, for the $2,000.
[201:09.53]That's $20.
[201:09.75]Don't be mad, Kevin.
[201:10.25]I'm trying.
[201:19.09]Gummy Monk, thank you for the 15 bucks.
[201:20.71]So, why are you playing one of the hardest characters?
[201:22.74]I don't know.
[201:23.48]I just wanted to see what it was like.
[201:26.34]And then I got real angry.
[201:29.36]I don't like getting angry, though.
[201:30.66]I'm not even angry.
[201:31.54]I'm just annoyed, I think is the term.
[201:37.03]This is one of those games that just really brings out the frustration.
[201:40.89]More than like a MOBA.
[201:44.53]Because when you do bad and you want to know why and you need to learn why and you keep fucking up.
[201:52.48]A good two hours there was very, very fun.
[201:56.24]When me and Star were cleaning up and doing well and it was working, it was great.
[202:01.31]That's where the game shines the most.
[202:02.31]But when you don't do well and you see things you don't like, this game ain't very fun.
[202:09.06]I need a Snickers.
[202:10.30]I will.
[202:11.80]I will absolutely get a Snickers.
[202:12.81]But thank you, Dr. Jensen, for the $5 earlier.
[202:16.37]Grizzly, thanks for the $3 as well.
[202:18.37]Did I miss anybody else that gave?
[202:21.01]Never Trust a Purple, thank you for the $3.
[202:22.11]$3 pay.
[202:22.23]Thanks, man.
[202:26.90]I think that's it for Bitwise.
[202:29.68]And then a bunch of subs came in, and like I said, I'm sorry.
[202:32.23]I'm sorry I have not been keeping up with resubs and subs recently, but I feel like the things that I've been doing the last week or two have been things that I can't pay attention.
[202:43.55]Like, last week was, like, the Resident Evil VR shit.
[202:45.59]I couldn't see anything.
[202:47.57]Um, and then this week, obviously, like, I played Nioh.
[202:50.17]Like, just, I couldn't really focus on, like, people popping up on the screen and shit like that.
[202:55.45]And I do apologize, but I do appreciate every single one of you guys.
[202:58.42]So, thank you, everybody, for your subs and resubs.
[203:00.28]I'm sorry I've been missing them.
[203:02.70]And that's gonna be it.
[203:03.98]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[203:04.76]Me and Star are gonna play this Overwatch weird make-your-own-game-mode thing.
[203:07.42]We'll see how it is.
[203:08.02]And have a good rest of your night, guys.
[203:11.88]Take care, everybody.
[203:13.79]See you all soon, and have a good night.
[203:17.97]And goodbye.
[204:05.32]you
