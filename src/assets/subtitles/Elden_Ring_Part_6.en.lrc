[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.74]Hello.
[00:06.60]How are you?
[00:07.32]How you doing?
[00:09.20]Oh, thanks.
[00:11.12]You good?
[00:13.16]What's up?
[00:16.00]I changed my Twitch server.
[00:19.75]See if that fixes the problem.
[00:25.85]I am streaming on a different server.
[00:29.29]If you're not here last night, for like five minutes, I would drop like a few hundred frames for no reason.
[00:37.13]It seemed to happen at the same exact interval.
[00:43.36]Apparently I have negative latency to your stream.
[00:45.80]I'm seeing it before you stream it.
[00:49.14]That's weird.
[00:53.96]Uh, some people were saying that it might have been a Twitch problem.
[00:56.26]Maybe the server I was connecting to.
[00:57.50]So I changed servers.
[00:58.30]Let's see if it fixes it.
[00:59.22]If not, then I... Unfortunately... I don't know what to do about it.
[01:05.00]Because my internet seems to be perfect.
[01:11.69]Today... I'm gonna... I'm gonna be very calm today.
[01:15.67]I'm going to relax.
[01:18.33]I'm going to... I'm gonna be in zen mode.
[01:23.44]I'm not going to get angry today.
[01:24.66]I'm going to very desperately try to stay focused.
[01:32.44]And my voice will not go over a certain amount of DB level.
[01:37.30]Okay?
[01:39.33]It's going to be collected.
[01:40.33]I'm going to just relax and enjoy the world of Elden Ring.
[01:44.85]Because that's all I do now.
[01:46.29]I'm literally an Elden Ring streamer.
[01:48.13]I don't do anything else.
[01:51.81]But yeah.
[01:55.09]I'm looking forward to it.
[01:55.87]It'll be a good time, as always.
[01:59.12]Hey, do you remember the VOD for the one?
[02:05.34]Do you remember the VOD for that last boss fight got deleted?
[02:09.86]It did?
[02:10.14]No, it didn't.
[02:11.22]Don't forget about Smite Saturdays.
[02:17.15]Do you smoke before this?
[02:22.49]No.
[02:25.55]I would never play Elden Ring inebriated.
[02:28.53]That's not going to happen.
[02:32.93]You understand how impossible that would be?
[02:36.27]You're asking me to do an impossible task.
[02:43.02]You can't.
[02:43.76]That's like handing somebody that's like just zonked out of their mind of Rubik's Cube.
[02:50.11]Then you have one minute to solve this.
[02:53.61]Huh?
[02:56.58]How's this it?
[02:57.61]It's scabbed over.
[02:58.31]It looks pretty bad.
[02:59.57]Whatever.
[03:09.97]I'm literally doing that right now.
[03:11.27]It's not that bad.
[03:12.22]I would be completely de-stressed, but that would be an unwatchable stream.
[03:21.12]Because I would walk into boss encounters and die in five seconds.
[03:27.54]And I wouldn't even care.
[03:28.58]I'd be like, oh, man, that's what he does?
[03:30.48]Oh, okay.
[03:32.46]And that would happen for two or three straight hours.
[03:33.95]Like, I wouldn't even attack the boss.
[03:36.47]So many people, like, claim that they would stay here and watch that kind of shit.
[03:40.89]But after an hour or two of doing that, I wouldn't attack the boss.
[03:48.12]You'd go do something else.
[03:49.50]You'd find something else to do.
[03:50.96]You just would.
[03:55.90]That would be the best stream.
[03:56.92]It would not.
[03:59.12]It would be an actual improvement.
[04:02.04]Oh, get out of here.
[04:09.66]Okay, you guys ready?
[04:12.82]I have marked some things on the map that I want to do.
[04:15.23]A few of them in particular.
[04:23.15]I want to continue this quest line for Ranni.
[04:29.18]Maybe please just do one designated song stream with me strong.
[04:36.40]Alright.
[04:37.96]I will... It might be fun to do a me strong stream in Elden Ring.
[04:47.81]And I would just be roleplaying.
[04:53.34]You guys are not going to want to watch it.
[04:54.88]It's going to be awful.
[04:56.32]No one's going to do it.
[04:58.89]No one's gonna want to watch that stream, I'm telling you.
[05:02.12]There's gonna be threads on Reddit about this.
[05:04.48]About, like, I mean, like, that was, like, not that funny.
[05:06.38]It was, like, kind of fucking, like, irresponsible and annoying of him.
[05:09.96]Um, like, that was the worst stream 2022, without a doubt.
[05:12.50]Like, it was, that was just boring and, like, not funny.
[05:14.54]You guys are not going to like this stream.
[05:16.81]I'm just, I want to be, I want to be clipped.
[05:19.07]Completely sober of sound mind and sound body.
[05:22.54]There will be people that... There are going to be a lot of people that are going to think that's the worst frame of the year.
[05:27.18]Okay?
[05:27.92]I just want to make sure I'm clear on that.
[05:30.30]So, let's just... I'm going to make it so you can't nominate it.
[05:34.21]It's grayed out.
[05:34.73]Okay.
[05:40.01]You guys ready?
[05:40.57]I'm ready.
[05:40.85]Let's get into it.
[05:42.21]Can you guys hear it?
[05:46.98]No, you can't.
[05:48.98]No, you can't.
[05:52.20]Make sure I got my fan going already and even been five minutes.
[05:56.97]I'm getting that fan going layer blowing on me That cannot be the way that is that Okay So use me I
[06:24.67]Eye.
[06:26.79]Eye.
[06:27.63]I've got, like, red circles under my eyes.
[06:30.09]Why?
[06:30.27]What does that mean?
[06:33.36]Actually, no, I think it's the lighting.
[06:34.86]The way the lighting is in the room.
[06:38.42]Yeah.
[06:39.02]It's just weird lighting.
[06:41.44]Alright.
[06:44.64]I gotta move this out of the way.
[06:46.41]So, last thing we did... By the way, this is the most face cams per capita you've ever had.
[06:53.77]This is the most face games you've ever had.
[06:55.15]Like, in a row.
[06:57.63]Ever.
[07:02.19]So, what?
[07:02.59]That's just something I don't normally do.
[07:06.91]Okay.
[07:08.13]I want to show you some stuff.
[07:09.95]First of all, let me show you some things.
[07:12.33]I have marked on the map specifically where we are going to go.
[07:17.31]We're going to go here.
[07:17.99]I was told by somebody in chat that this is the place that I would be very interested in, so I marked it.
[07:25.20]I also wanted to make sure that I checked, got this map fragment.
[07:32.14]I also wanted to check out this place because it looked kind of cool, like a church or something, right?
[07:38.54]I also wanted to go here.
[07:41.62]This looked like an interesting boulder of some sort.
[07:43.82]And I don't know what this spiky stuff is, but this looks like an interesting boulder to me.
[07:49.99]Zip will go away in like a week.
[07:51.07]Don't worry.
[07:55.55]And then I want to continue the quest line.
[07:58.11]So at the end of that Redan fight,
[08:02.69]The stars all fell.
[08:03.75]And I was like, oh, falling stars!
[08:05.95]Falling stars!
[08:06.85]And I had to go find them.
[08:09.07]So I'm going to go look over here.
[08:09.99]Because from the lore perspective, it sounded like it may have been somewhere around this vicinity.
[08:16.82]If I were to take a guess.
[08:18.94]So, we're going to check this out here.
[08:23.82]Permanent zip.
[08:27.11]south of the Mistwood that's what I was thinking too I was thinking like somewhere in this vicinity here because this looks like an area it could fall nice cringe lore that's like one of the coolest parts of all the Dark Souls games is like the lore anybody has anybody ever looked at you like that before in your life
[08:51.74]I used to get that all the time.
[08:53.54]I used to get that all the time.
[08:55.89]Like, it'd be like, I'm saying something, saying something.
[08:59.65]Like, that's equal parts stop and equal parts what are you doing?
[09:03.81]Like, what are you saying?
[09:07.35]Like... Yeah, me too.
[09:13.00]That happened to me too, yeah.
[09:15.48]Microwave rant.
[09:21.41]I need to start to put a tally on how many times that happens to me.
[09:27.24]It's very distinctive.
[09:28.76]It's not, look, it's not... Nope.
[09:32.46]It's not... It's... It's very distinct.
[09:38.36]It's equally parts... Confused and upset and... Kind of, like, what?
[09:45.60]Alright, let's go.
[09:48.17]We're going to check section one, which is this part right here.
[09:52.15]I'm going to go in order.
[09:55.21]I heard this is something I'd be interested in.
[10:00.56]That's the face that I make almost all the time when watching you.
[10:04.76]You're wicked funny.
[10:09.40]Okay, so how do I get up there, though?
[10:14.51]I was told I'd be very interested in this space here.
[10:24.10]I don't think I can get up here this way.
[10:27.60]No.
[10:28.81]There's some cringe rocks in the way.
[10:32.81]How am I going to... From this way?
[10:35.73]How do I get on this road?
[10:38.51]This is... Oh, this is the bridge.
[10:40.52]Okay, so how... I'm going to have to go from here, aren't I?
[10:44.72]I don't think I can get up there from here.
[10:52.69]Yeah.
[10:53.59]I'll go from here.
[10:55.35]Or... I think I have to go backwards from here.
[10:58.12]I don't know.
[11:01.14]Or maybe forwards from here.
[11:02.08]Let's try forwards from here.
[11:02.96]Doesn't know how to read a map.
[11:10.50]You look like some... I don't... I know.
[11:12.92]I look like everybody you've ever seen in your life.
[11:17.19]So I need to go this way.
[11:26.72]Not that way, over here.
[11:33.80]I look like my grandma.
[11:39.68]That would actually be kind of funny if I really did look like your grandmother.
[11:42.77]Is there just an item here?
[11:55.12]Fire arrows.
[11:55.92]Cool.
[11:56.40]Okay, let's keep going.
[11:57.04]I gotta follow just the path.
[11:58.66]Yeah, I didn't get a bunch of these things.
[12:03.26]Hey, can you please kiss the camera?
[12:04.44]You know how many times I've done that?
[12:07.88]There's somebody in here.
[12:10.18]You know how many times I've kissed the camera and regretted it immediately after doing it?
[12:18.30]Who's this guy?
[12:20.50]War Master Sheck.
[12:22.26]Not seen you before.
[12:24.44]Name's Bernard.
[12:26.50]Tarnished, just like you.
[12:29.06]Let me ask you something.
[12:31.22]Are you here in the Lands Between to take up the fight?
[12:34.31]Yeah.
[12:34.61]Does your faith in the guidance of Grace hold firm?
[12:37.87]Yeah.
[12:38.29]Despite the collapse of the Golden Order?
[12:40.77]Yeah.
[12:43.41]Yeah.
[12:43.73]Yes, you're a tarnished through and through.
[12:47.29]Takes me back.
[12:49.35]Battle arts.
[12:49.81]Okay.
[12:49.99]This guy sells battle arts?
[12:51.11]Ah, okay.
[12:51.37]Very cool.
[13:14.54]Well, I don't think I really need any of these or want any of these in this playthrough because... I'm a magic magician person.
[13:22.45]So... Pretty cool though.
[13:26.69]The Myriad!
[13:27.23]Ster!
[13:31.24]Mementos of all the warriors who raised their arms in battle.
[13:35.57]Lost and died.
[13:37.73]A fine tale all told of true chivalric romance.
[13:42.65]That's how I fell in love with the sword.
[13:45.19]What level am I?
[13:46.96]60.
[13:47.64]It grants meaning even to falling in battle.
[13:51.34]To death itself.
[13:54.64]Oh.
[13:54.98]Knowledge of the arts.
[14:01.21]Alright.
[14:04.89]See you later.
[14:05.45]Have fun.
[14:06.79]Good luck with you.
[14:07.85]The world's wacky out there, so just be careful.
[14:11.59]That's cool, though.
[14:12.20]I don't need any of that, but that's cool to know that that's what that is.
[14:15.46]We're going to continue.
[14:16.34]I want to go that way.
[14:17.18]I had a dream last night that you did an in-person event.
[14:29.92]You were there.
[14:30.34]You did an in-person event.
[14:31.50]You did an IRL, like, tier list, like, live show.
[14:37.00]What?
[14:37.30]It was, like, kind of fun.
[14:39.96]What are you talking about?
[14:50.39]Ooh, this is a new space.
[14:51.05]Alright, what's here?
[14:56.55]There's probably something here that I didn't get.
[14:59.61]Jort sword.
[15:07.25]Oh, come on.
[15:08.13]I don't want to fight anybody.
[15:08.93]I just want to take all the stuff in your camp.
[15:11.79]I don't want to fight you for it.
[15:25.86]I don't want to fight you for any of this stuff.
[15:27.14]I just want it.
[15:33.39]I met you while lucid dreaming.
[15:34.61]Were you the guy with the green hat on?
[15:38.61]What the fuck, dude?
[15:39.47]What?
[15:40.89]We both were flying next to each other.
[15:43.51]And I looked over and you gave me the thumbs up.
[15:45.97]And I had the big airplane goggles on.
[15:48.67]Like the big, like the Red Baron goggles on.
[15:51.20]That was so much fun.
[15:58.72]It sucks, though, when I fucking... Like, I stopped flapping my wings and I, like, froze in mid-place.
[16:04.08]I did a big cartoon gulp and fell.
[16:07.84]You laughed at that, which is kind of fucking... That's kind of annoying.
[16:13.00]But, you know.
[16:14.62]It was still cool to see you, though.
[16:15.56]I had a dream that you were over my head.
[16:33.48]You're losing so many viewers.
[16:38.42]I don't think we're losing viewers.
[16:40.66]I think we're getting to the stage where a lot of people don't want to see.
[16:43.12]Because a lot of people aren't necessarily grinding out this game.
[16:49.74]So the further we go in Elden Ring, the further that people might not be.
[16:53.59]And they might not want to see.
[16:55.87]So that's the phenomenon you're experiencing here.
[16:57.83]And that's cope.
[16:59.71]That's streamer cope.
[17:01.11]But it's true.
[17:03.59]It's true.
[17:04.73]See?
[17:05.25]One person said that.
[17:12.22]You know how I know that?
[17:13.14]Do you know why I know that's true?
[17:14.52]Because the first three or four days of Elden Ring, I was watching tons of streamers.
[17:19.52]Oh my god, how'd they do with that guy?
[17:21.78]I have avoided every single person's broadcast the last, like, four days.
[17:26.88]I've not looked at anybody.
[17:28.36]No one.
[17:29.80]So... I mean, that... There you go.
[17:33.40]Kind of... Kind of the way it is.
[17:35.12]Alright, so I gotta cross this bridge.
[17:38.04]But not yet.
[17:43.93]And plus, I... Not every stream has... Can have... 20,000 people on it.
[17:49.41]Like, I don't even know.
[18:03.06]I get it, man.
[18:03.70]I get it.
[18:04.08]These guys have so much health.
[18:08.22]He's gonna break down because he's lost it.
[18:10.41]But, I mean, I've only been live for fucking, like, 15 minutes.
[18:17.87]I don't pay attention to that kind of stuff that much.
[18:21.29]Alright.
[18:24.52]Should I kill this thing?
[18:29.50]It has so much health.
[18:32.48]Wait.
[18:33.42]How come this one doesn't have that much health?
[18:38.39]These vary in how much health they have.
[18:39.85]Okay.
[18:40.45]So, wait a minute.
[18:44.25]Alright, never mind.
[18:46.77]That one that was on the rooftop, I couldn't even hurt.
[18:48.40]Is it just because they scaled to the area they're in?
[19:00.36]yes frames dropping again no they're not don't even say that what it can't be be serious no hold on a minute let me let me do it let me do something real quick give me one second
[19:36.83]I don't get it.
[19:44.82]My speed tests are perfect.
[19:51.57]It couldn't get any better than this.
[19:52.83]It couldn't.
[19:53.99]What's going on?
[20:04.54]Yeah, I was running a speed test.
[20:06.10]That's why I killed it.
[20:11.36]I don't think server matters.
[20:12.48]This is happening to East Coast streamers too.
[20:14.48]What?
[20:17.18]Huh.
[20:22.10]I did switch servers.
[20:23.40]I did.
[20:29.68]Yeah, I just ran a speed test and it's perfect.
[20:42.64]Well, that's frustrating.
[20:44.98]Sorry, guys.
[20:45.51]I wish there was something I could do about it.
[20:49.03]I don't think it's a problem on my end.
[20:51.21]I don't.
[20:55.03]Yeah.
[20:56.19]Well, I'm sorry that we kind of have to painfully deal with this.
[20:58.22]Because I changed servers.
[21:05.78]Doesn't seem to have fixed anything.
[21:11.22]Well, we will press on.
[21:12.60]I gotta go down there.
[21:18.29]Alright, cross this bridge.
[21:32.26]It's not fine.
[21:33.08]It's not bad.
[21:33.57]Yeah.
[21:36.26]That really does... It still sucks, though, because this is one of those games and one of those streams where we're kind of experiencing this.
[21:43.13]And the harder it is to experience for some of you guys, the more irritated it makes me.
[21:49.01]This is so new.
[21:51.03]It looks fine.
[21:53.63]It's probably going to keep happening, unfortunately.
[21:56.49]I don't think there's very much I can do about it.
[22:04.76]Okay, let's just kill this guy.
[22:07.10]Am I leveled up for this area?
[22:08.94]Probably.
[22:17.66]It's all your fault.
[22:19.04]I think stone.
[22:29.21]Yeah, we're in.
[22:30.01]Okay, so now I'm here.
[22:33.74]I was told that I would be very interested in this area over here.
[22:38.10]And there's also something in the middle here, too.
[22:39.60]Alright, I haven't seen any of this, so let's take a minute.
[22:49.94]Ooh.
[22:53.08]Hey, I have a question.
[22:54.94]Is the... Is the Erdtree in the middle?
[22:58.15]Is that why?
[22:59.13]Hold on.
[22:59.43]What's going to matter?
[23:00.43]Is the Urge tree just in the middle?
[23:02.13]Huge.
[23:03.73]Whatever you've done.
[23:05.05]It is, right?
[23:15.82]I'll show you.
[23:17.68]This gigantic tree.
[23:25.66]Am I still in combat?
[23:26.42]Oh.
[23:32.32]Like, is this the Erdtree here just huge in the middle?
[23:39.78]That would make sense.
[23:40.46]Alright, let's do it.
[23:52.81]This is the area I was told to come explore.
[23:55.59]I said, Jerma, go check out this area then.
[24:05.52]Somebody said, you'd be very interested to see what's here.
[24:11.92]Not actually this space, but, you know, a little bit further.
[24:19.24]What, a boat?
[24:25.32]Why don't you just get on and walk?
[24:31.40]What's the point of being in a boat?
[24:33.70]That's harder to push.
[24:35.02]Who is this?
[24:35.54]Tibia Mariner?
[24:36.18]Where are you?
[24:36.83]Is this him right here?
[24:56.16]Where are you?
[24:56.54]Where'd you go?
[24:56.94]Are you hiding?
[25:04.16]Oh, there you are.
[25:11.37]You can't be that dangerous, right?
[25:12.69]Like, I'm... Is this person just actually in a boat?
[25:22.17]This person, like, sucks.
[25:26.11]I think they got to, like, the boss sign-up sheet.
[25:29.73]And... FromSoftware was just like, Alright, I guess we're going to add you.
[25:35.18]That's fine.
[25:35.68]Where'd you go?
[25:43.22]Alright, let's go kill this guy.
[25:50.14]Yeah, okay, so you want to be a boss in Elden Ring?
[25:53.23]Yes.
[25:54.31]What do you do, man?
[25:56.12]Um, I have a boat.
[25:57.56]Alright, boat encounter.
[25:58.70]Sick.
[25:58.98]Cool.
[25:59.28]Boat encounter, man.
[26:00.58]Alright, so you're gonna be like flying down like a speedboat.
[26:02.92]You're gonna have like a Criken come up.
[26:06.00]Um... Yeah.
[26:09.64]No way, bro.
[26:10.42]Seriously?
[26:12.58]Oh, wow.
[26:13.10]Yeah, absolutely.
[26:13.84]So, how much damage do you think you can do?
[26:15.60]Two.
[26:19.66]Two thousand?
[26:20.32]No fucking way, bro.
[26:21.42]Cool.
[26:22.60]Get him on there.
[26:23.22]Quick.
[26:23.84]Get him on the list.
[26:32.82]This poor guy.
[26:33.66]This is just a regular enemy.
[26:35.81]He wasn't even supposed to be in the game.
[26:37.57]I feel so bad.
[26:43.19]I actually feel bad for that guy.
[26:45.15]Deathroot?
[26:48.13]Skeletal Militiaman Ashes.
[26:50.67]Okay.
[26:57.11]Hey, don't even say anything else, man.
[26:59.27]Welcome to Dark Souls.
[27:00.69]Welcome to Elden Ring, man.
[27:09.37]That actually is Pinwheel.
[27:12.25]That was easier than Pinwheel.
[27:14.15]Even if I was... What level am I?
[27:16.37]Level 60?
[27:16.81]Yeah, I'm level 60.
[27:21.75]So if I was level 45 or 50, I still think that would be impossible to lose.
[27:26.77]That's not possible to lose.
[27:31.87]That guy literally was the last minute sign-off.
[27:36.77]Okay, well that was fun.
[27:38.15]Anything else here?
[27:50.56]That was cool.
[27:52.70]This guy in a fucking boat.
[27:58.42]Oh, just die.
[28:01.02]I was level 16 when I did that.
[28:02.69]I got bone boys?
[28:13.67]I think is it only two?
[28:14.89]Or is it more than two bone boys?
[28:25.05]Okay, I think there's a place to go down here.
[28:26.95]I think there's a dungeon here.
[28:37.40]I would be surprised if there wasn't.
[28:38.36]Okay.
[28:53.50]By the way, I have to get intelligence to 52 if I plan on using that staff.
[28:57.68]There's got to be a way to go down.
[29:04.32]Right?
[29:04.48]There's got to be.
[29:08.92]Hmm.
[29:09.94]Check over here one more time.
[29:15.91]This, that down here.
[29:27.87]I don't know.
[29:28.33]I don't see anything.
[29:31.93]Oh, my back.
[29:32.55]Okay.
[29:34.55]I don't see any way to go down.
[29:39.68]Maybe it's here somewhere.
[29:40.52]I'll check one more time this way.
[29:44.58]And that's it.
[29:48.18]Wait, someone said next to the turtle.
[29:49.30]Are you sure?
[29:50.73]Are you for real?
[29:51.73]Are you for real?
[29:54.39]I said what turtle?
[29:55.07]Turtle?
[29:55.35]Are you for real?
[30:05.31]Next to the turtle.
[30:08.07]I don't remember where the turtle was.
[30:09.81]Where's the turtle?
[30:12.83]Is it a turtle?
[30:14.21]Ah, fuck it.
[30:14.61]Whatever.
[30:15.01]I'll come back later.
[30:15.63]I don't know.
[30:17.25]I don't know where the turtle is.
[30:18.29]I don't know where the turtle is.
[30:35.79]What about over there?
[30:36.29]Not over here.
[30:40.68]What about this one?
[30:51.07]Thanks.
[30:58.51]I can't go down here.
[31:00.39]Why not?
[31:03.82]How do I get down there?
[31:08.91]It's a stone sword.
[31:09.87]Oh, it is.
[31:11.69]Let's go.
[31:13.03]Let's do it.
[31:13.57]Let's do it.
[31:13.95]Let's do it.
[31:14.31]Let's do it.
[31:14.63]I got plenty of these.
[31:16.53]Let's go.
[31:16.97]Let's go for it.
[31:28.36]I don't... This dungeon is going to get me kicked off the internet.
[31:40.58]I don't have to fight these, right?
[31:46.98]Okay.
[31:47.20]Because I like the turtle thing.
[31:49.38]Like, everybody loves the turtles in Elden Ring.
[31:51.31]And, like, I'm not just going to kill a room full of turtles.
[31:55.11]Green turtle talisman.
[31:57.59]I got the turtle talisman.
[32:01.75]What's that?
[32:08.36]Oh, that's good.
[32:09.37]Raises stamina recovery speed.
[32:16.43]Turtles are known as a nutritious ingredient, symbolic of inexhaustible power.
[32:27.28]So I just have permanent stamina recovery?
[32:30.40]Is that better than...
[32:36.06]Slowly... How much HP does this load?
[32:39.48]It's low HP.
[32:41.83]And maybe get rid of this.
[32:42.57]That's the best talisman in the game.
[32:52.47]Well, that was worth coming down here.
[32:53.87]Very cool.
[33:04.36]It's really slow, but it'll save you flasks.
[33:08.78]Well, thank you.
[33:09.61]I appreciate that, turtle friend.
[33:13.69]What a weird animal.
[33:17.45]What a weird animal.
[33:19.53]It's like... It's like this weird, like... It's almost like an elephant.
[33:27.30]But they have elephant feet.
[33:29.18]And like lizard heads...
[33:31.69]Like, big, like, rock bodies.
[33:33.49]What a fucking weird animal.
[33:35.23]Like, what an interesting... And they live to be, like, 150 years old.
[33:42.19]So strange.
[33:46.01]They have elephant feet.
[33:46.79]Yeah, look at their... Look at this guy's elephant feet.
[33:49.59]He's got elephant feet.
[33:55.82]Cool.
[33:57.78]They're so slow, but they're so wise.
[34:05.46]Did we just make that up, by the way?
[34:10.84]Is there a reason why, like, the turtle in all TV shows and movies is old and has, like, a furrowed brow?
[34:17.82]Is it because they're old and we just, like, made them?
[34:19.62]We just pretend they are?
[34:23.28]Oh.
[34:29.01]Okay.
[34:30.69]Old equals wise.
[34:32.17]That's right.
[34:34.72]They live a long time.
[34:35.89]Yeah, that's why we've made them, like, intelligent beings.
[34:40.21]We made them, like, super intelligent alien beings.
[34:43.67]They live a long time.
[34:44.55]But that's cool, though.
[34:45.45]That's cool that they can live that long.
[34:50.95]Alright, so now I want to go this way.
[34:52.01]That was not what I was told to go see.
[34:54.48]Gotta keep going.
[34:58.20]Elephants are wise.
[34:58.84]Yeah, elephants are very intelligent, right?
[35:00.90]Elephants are very wise.
[35:05.91]I can't remember a piece of media, TV show, cartoon, movie, video game, where an elephant was... Yes, it's me, the elephant.
[35:14.42]The old and wise elephant with, like, gray hairs here.
[35:18.58]How many gray-haired tortoises have you seen?
[35:22.40]I think I gotta go this way.
[35:32.72]It's turtles and owls.
[35:37.30]No, the Ninja Turtles don't count.
[35:38.64]They got covered in ooze.
[35:39.66]That doesn't count.
[35:48.52]Any animal could have been in that ooze and they would have become, you know, that.
[35:57.63]It could have been like the Ninja Seahorses if they had gone in that goo.
[36:01.01]So that doesn't count.
[36:06.61]Okay, where is it?
[36:07.37]There's apparently a cave here somewhere.
[36:12.97]I was told explicitly to come here.
[36:14.87]How come they chose turtles for that show?
[36:20.63]I don't know.
[36:23.40]They just kind of did, didn't they?
[36:25.92]That's up further.
[36:27.96]Is it up there?
[36:36.14]Those turtles are cool.
[36:36.86]Turtles are cool.
[36:41.34]They should have just used people.
[36:47.42]That would just be... Teenage Mutant Ninjas!
[36:50.82]Teenage Mutant Ninjas!
[36:54.84]Heroes!
[36:56.90]Teenagers!
[36:58.18]How would you even do that?
[37:07.07]Okay, I think this is right.
[37:08.45]What do I have against turtles?
[37:13.69]I just told you that I thought turtles were a cool animal!
[37:25.54]Can you swing at him please?
[37:27.34]Oh my goodness, really?
[37:28.54]Are you that bad?
[37:31.98]I just said that I thought turtles were cool.
[37:36.47]Alright, so what's here?
[37:38.81]What is it?
[37:39.19]There's something right here.
[37:45.55]What is it?
[37:58.20]Ah.
[38:00.61]Do you not think snakes are cool?
[38:01.91]I think snakes are cool, but they just scare me.
[38:05.69]Oh, alright.
[38:06.45]Okay, cool.
[38:07.37]Let's go.
[38:10.43]Snakes kind of scare the shit out of me.
[38:12.67]Not because... Honestly, I don't... I'm not afraid of snakes.
[38:15.73]I'm afraid of snakes' unpredictability.
[38:19.69]Snakes are unpredictable.
[38:28.47]I have this fear of, okay, a snake is just like, oh, you want to hold the snake?
[38:32.29]Yeah, sure.
[38:33.51]And it just kind of, it's wrapping around my arm and looking at me and going, it's like, oh, hey, hey, hey, little guy.
[38:42.67]Like licking and like kind of looks cute.
[38:45.01]And then I move like a way that they don't like.
[38:47.78]And he, ah!
[38:52.84]And I'm like, and I start to fucking pass out and shit.
[38:54.66]Like, I don't know.
[38:55.26]They freak me out.
[38:57.71]I just feel like they're unpredictable.
[38:59.27]Like, you can't determine what the move is that they're not gonna like.
[39:03.41]So, like, if you have a snake in front of you, and you turn your eyes a certain way, I don't like that.
[39:10.80]I don't like what you just did.
[39:12.10]And, like, they hit a fucking strike.
[39:13.62]I don't know.
[39:14.26]They're unpredictable.
[39:21.48]What about children are unpredictable, too?
[39:23.16]Children...
[39:26.31]Yes, a child is unpredictable, but the difference is watching like a two-year-old like bounce around walking and like bump into a wall is not the same as a snake biting you in the neck.
[39:38.30]It's different.
[39:39.58]A toddler is not going to come up to you and look at you and be like, what is it, a little Johnny?
[39:46.48]What do you want?
[39:48.96]And just like fucking leap at you and like fucking strike you right here.
[40:00.68]How am I supposed to get down there?
[40:03.70]Horses are unpredictable, too.
[40:07.18]I'm just saying, and I'm saying a lot, there's no poisonous horses!
[40:15.50]Look, if a snake, if there were snakes that just bit you and that was it, it's like, fuck, I got a snake bite.
[40:20.51]A shitload of snakes can literally kill you.
[40:22.87]There's not a poisonous horse.
[40:26.33]Although if a horse, like, buck and kicks you in the face, it's gonna cave in your face.
[40:32.18]That, okay, that argument's not that sound.
[40:35.44]But you understand what I mean, though?
[40:36.59]Like, a snake can hide.
[40:37.65]A snake can hide somewhere in, like, a bush.
[40:41.81]I know that the danger level of a horse if you get you know kicked bucked in the face it's gonna blow up your whole face you're gonna die instantly but like I can see the horse I can run from the horse right I can see the horse from a mile away a snake just like in a bush is like where is he I don't know he's in somewhere near me and then they get up and they're like this and they go like that and you like they like fray out their heads and then it's like okay I can't if I move I'm dead
[41:16.74]It's unpredictable.
[41:20.33]Tigers are like that too.
[41:21.69]Sometimes a tiger or a lion will just be like... It's just like, whoa, whoa, what happened?
[41:30.58]What happened?
[41:30.94]What's going on?
[41:32.52]Why'd they freak out?
[41:34.82]Sometimes they just freak out.
[41:35.92]Sometimes animals just freak out.
[41:40.59]Snakes.
[41:41.67]Tigers.
[41:42.25]Like, no, I don't like unpredictable animals.
[41:44.15]I like predictable animals.
[41:45.23]Like a fucking little, like, sausage dog.
[41:48.17]Because they're just gonna lie on the couch.
[41:49.87]And they're not gonna, like... There's no point where Otto is gonna, like, roll over.
[41:54.06]I'm gonna be rubbing his stomach and he's gonna go like, Oh, yeah.
[41:57.80]Hey!
[41:58.32]And, like, come and fucking kill me.
[42:00.06]Like, that's not gonna happen.
[42:08.26]Oh, the title of the stream.
[42:16.76]Do you live in a rain forest?
[42:19.36]No, I don't live in a rain forest.
[42:21.14]I'm just saying.
[42:21.88]I am comfortable- I'm not comfortable around certain animals as much as I think they're cool.
[42:25.82]I think snakes are really cool animals.
[42:28.70]I just don't want to hold one.
[42:31.00]And I know that- Oh, but Mr. Schnookums, my snake is so cool.
[42:35.47]That's fine.
[42:35.99]I don't care.
[42:36.49]Hold him.
[42:37.31]I'll watch.
[42:37.91]I'll take a fucking picture.
[42:40.46]Like, big tarantula spiders?
[42:42.00]No, I don't want to hold your tarantula.
[42:43.68]I don't get it.
[42:44.74]I want to be within, like, three or four counties away from that thing.
[42:57.33]Your neck is all red.
[42:58.23]I'm telling you, that's what I'm saying.
[42:59.15]I got bit by a snake.
[43:04.17]Have you ever seen a wild tarantula before?
[43:07.95]Look, we're not talking about in the wild.
[43:09.81]We're talking about people that have pets.
[43:12.61]There's a ton of people that have tarantula pets.
[43:14.89]A ton of people have snakes for pets.
[43:17.33]I'm glad you like it.
[43:18.25]I hope you enjoy it.
[43:19.73]They're probably so loving and so wonderful.
[43:21.97]I don't want it near me.
[43:23.12]I don't want to be near it.
[43:23.86]I'll look at it from a distance.
[43:28.12]Okay, I need to level up.
[43:40.74]And those little ball pythons, they're so cute, and they're so nice, and they're so fun, and they'll just kind of sit and hang out with you.
[43:48.98]But that one moment, that one moment in my brain where I did something unpredictable to the snake, and he latches on and doesn't let go.
[44:03.71]You can put it on a leash.
[44:05.17]You don't put a leash on a snake.
[44:11.61]Ooh, I can do it now.
[44:27.68]Alright, let me... Okay, this that way?
[44:30.81]Okay.
[44:32.87]Object permanence time.
[44:34.67]Object permanence time.
[44:36.93]Down.
[44:38.27]Right.
[44:39.29]Left.
[44:41.82]Got it.
[44:42.10]Okay.
[44:42.36]You go right.
[44:44.20]1100 damage.
[44:48.02]Holy crap.
[45:13.72]Okay, this leads into this waterfall area.
[45:15.52]I just have to do that once.
[45:22.21]Okay.
[45:25.65]This is a tiny little area to fight this.
[45:45.48]What?
[45:45.98]I don't have any juice left.
[45:53.81]Fuck.
[45:55.45]Bad timing.
[45:59.49]I gotta get around him.
[46:01.65]Here we go.
[46:06.58]That's not doing enough damage to remotely even consider using.
[46:18.95]Oh man, he's susceptible to that for sure.
[46:21.09]Behind you, what?
[46:40.34]Still alive?
[46:45.80]You were very susceptible to that.
[46:51.52]Bland octopus ovary.
[46:54.94]Cross?
[46:56.16]Naginata?
[46:58.08]Causes blood loss.
[47:06.95]Dex C. This thing looks crazy.
[47:16.60]Oh, it's a spear.
[47:17.61]That's cool.
[47:23.49]There's a spider behind you.
[47:24.47]Oh.
[47:32.31]Got him.
[47:42.15]Damn it.
[47:43.49]My room is too clean.
[47:46.05]I was hoping I could put like a piece of like brown or like black dust or something in my hand and be like, oh yeah, and show it.
[47:52.99]Well, I thought that was going to be like a piece, like a little piece of something like I could put in my hand.
[47:58.83]Why do you look AI generated?
[48:00.17]I don't know, because I'm ugly, okay?
[48:03.71]Why don't you just say what you want to say?
[48:14.72]Ooh.
[48:15.14]Okay, so that's... There's nothing here.
[48:29.49]You won't acknowledge his hickeys.
[48:32.47]Dude, I was literally pretending to bite my neck with a snake.
[48:41.42]Can you imagine if I just showed up on stream one day and they were just like...
[48:49.47]I just don't say anything.
[49:06.20]I need 20,000.
[49:07.24]I'm putting it into health.
[49:09.12]Don't worry.
[49:12.62]Does it be covered in boils for your next stream?
[49:20.15]No, people would be concerned.
[49:21.73]That would be concerning.
[49:23.61]People would be like, what the hell is happening?
[49:25.05]Is he okay?
[49:28.27]If I just had boils everywhere, like big bubbles.
[49:31.03]I'm going to do a prosthetic makeup person or something and had him all over me.
[49:34.75]I guess it would be like, what happened?
[49:37.67]That would actually scare the shit out of people.
[49:40.73]And if I didn't make a joke about it or something, I feel like people would not be happy about that.
[49:44.89]They'd be like, dude, come on.
[49:46.04]Like, what the fuck?
[49:52.79]Just draw a bunch more zits.
[49:58.35]You just say you're allergic to something.
[49:59.95]Yeah, sorry guys.
[50:03.45]I changed laundry detergents.
[50:09.24]That's actually kind of funny.
[50:13.10]Yeah, sorry guys.
[50:13.90]I'm using a new brand of detergent.
[50:16.62]I think it's my blanket.
[50:19.30]I don't know.
[50:20.10]I had a big reaction to it.
[50:23.85]Okay, so that is everything down there.
[50:25.30]I have enough to level up, I think.
[50:27.58]Let's just do it.
[50:38.62]Where was that?
[50:39.36]I want that spear.
[50:40.28]I'll show you in just a sec.
[50:44.76]That spear is behind the big octopus in the Gale Tunnel, which is in this weird section down off the road here between Caelid and Limgrave.
[50:58.97]Come down this way.
[50:59.91]There's a cave down here.
[51:01.14]There's some enemies down here as well.
[51:03.62]You're looking for that spear.
[51:11.32]Pretty good weapon.
[51:11.92]It looks kind of cool.
[51:13.73]I'll have to check it out.
[51:14.33]I'll try it on.
[51:15.67]I need... One more kill should do it and then I'm going to put it into health.
[51:32.34]How big is your spear?
[51:34.54]Um...
[51:39.45]Well, this is a, this is a short sword, so.
[51:44.12]It's like maybe, well, I was using a dagger before, so.
[51:46.38]34 inches?
[51:47.66]Did you talk about like the blade, like from the blade to the, uh, handle?
[51:55.08]That's what I was using, it was a dagger.
[51:58.45]Oh!
[51:58.95]What?
[51:59.29]Oh my god!
[51:59.87]What the heck happened?
[52:00.59]I said something weird and gross!
[52:11.07]Alright, let's keep going.
[52:18.80]No reason to fight any of you.
[52:26.60]I would get banned from my own chat.
[52:28.77]Let me just be clear.
[52:32.77]I would get banned from my own chat.
[52:34.01]Like, I would actually get banned from my own chat.
[52:43.21]Hey!
[52:44.43]Grace mimic?
[52:47.09]What is that?
[53:05.19]Oh, it's the thing where you break it and it kills, it gets rid of all your souls and puts you to a bonfire.
[53:13.77]Five of them.
[53:14.63]Is that it?
[53:21.74]That was down here.
[53:22.34]That's it.
[53:23.40]Oh, hold on.
[53:23.80]This is, this is Smithing Stone.
[53:46.09]There's something big behind here.
[53:47.11]Okay, is there a bonfire right here?
[53:56.23]Because that thing, whatever that is, it's big.
[54:01.65]This guy died at Pinwheel?
[54:03.25]Yes, of course.
[54:03.79]I'm glad I didn't just open that door.
[54:07.63]Okay.
[54:13.54]Did you play Destiny 2 if there were sex scenes?
[54:15.49]No.
[54:16.59]Who cares?
[54:16.95]What's down here?
[54:21.73]This is the other entrance.
[54:27.23]I have way too many flasks.
[54:30.37]Oh, my back.
[54:31.01]I've been acting up lately.
[54:33.45]Like this chest thing.
[54:36.87]Let's do... I'll do 7 and 2.
[54:52.20]Alright, who's in here?
[54:54.10]Go headphones.
[55:03.22]Magma Wyrm.
[55:04.04]Didn't I already fight this guy?
[55:05.16]I already- Didn't I fight this dude already?
[55:10.98]Alright, settle down.
[55:14.02]Oh no, I fought the Magma Wyrm Makar!
[55:17.18]So this guy is made by the big Magma Wyrm guy, okay.
[55:30.51]Well, I have experience fighting you.
[55:40.03]How about Flintstones?
[56:01.48]Oh, fuck.
[56:02.06]What am I doing?
[56:02.92]I'm not like at Disney World.
[56:04.20]Like, what am I doing?
[56:31.02]Oh!
[56:36.83]Now does he stand up like his friend?
[56:38.75]Stop doing that move!
[56:52.86]Stop doing the move in this tiny little area!
[56:56.31]Stop doing that move.
[56:57.65]Stop doing that move.
[56:59.79]Okay.
[57:00.35]Like, dude.
[57:02.29]You guys gonna run in a circle?
[57:03.63]It's a tiny circle.
[57:08.47]I got it.
[57:08.71]I got it.
[57:13.39]Got all these magma worms.
[57:16.21]Magma Wyrm Makar.
[57:20.79]He makes the magma worms.
[57:23.32]He's like the chocolate factory guy.
[57:29.95]You died to the Magma Wyrm at level 60.
[57:33.77]Did your Magma Wyrm do three or four magma runs in a row?
[57:38.21]I didn't think so.
[57:40.67]So... Okay.
[57:45.42]Object permanence.
[57:46.00]Where are we going?
[57:51.52]Wrong way.
[57:56.92]Can I summon Oleg in there?
[57:58.25]But Oleg kind of sucks against these guys.
[57:59.75]I actually probably would rather have the boys.
[58:34.57]Oh, the boys are dead.
[58:50.87]Oh, he spins all the way around.
[58:56.53]Oh.
[59:10.25]Let that fire dissipate.
[59:25.50]Dude, I got a river of flame here.
[59:48.56]Do you stand up?
[60:12.61]Do you stand up like your friend does?
[60:32.48]He does stand up
[61:07.09]I don't think he stands up.
[61:08.59]That's the difference.
[61:09.99]It's just annoying.
[61:10.69]It has a lot of health.
[61:23.26]What the fuck?
[61:24.88]Oh, what the fuck?
[61:26.48]What the fuck?
[61:27.66]What the fuck?
[61:28.90]What the fuck?
[61:30.17]What the fuck?
[61:31.47]What the fuck?
[61:41.24]Alright.
[62:26.99]Let's go.
[63:21.44]Hey!
[63:22.00]I dodged it.
[63:23.15]I didn't.
[63:39.71]Ooh, another Dragonheart, and I got another thing called Moonvale.
[63:44.13]Moonvale.
[64:02.99]It's a int and dex scaling katana.
[64:11.95]Really?
[64:26.65]Wow, it has a magic slash?
[64:42.90]Chief's blade holding it at the hip in a composed stance.
[64:45.44]Fall up with it either a normal or a strong attack to draw the blade at great speed.
[64:49.72]Both attacks fire a wave of light.
[64:56.40]Oh.
[64:58.83]My whole body just got cold.
[65:08.03]What does it take to level up?
[65:17.72]It's fast.
[65:18.70]It's fast as fuck, too.
[65:25.09]That's a huge wa- I wonder how much damage that does.
[65:27.43]How much mana does it take?
[65:30.49]Because that goes far, and look at- That's a huge wave.
[65:37.76]That doesn't take very much mana.
[65:39.44]I wonder how much it does.
[65:40.30]And it has bleed?
[65:41.22]Are you kidding me?
[65:44.80]It's a magic bleed weapon?
[65:53.68]This is the best INT weapon in the game.
[65:56.30]What the fuck?
[66:03.75]It hits like a truck.
[66:07.21]Alright, dude.
[66:08.97]Um... I... Okay, for now, let's... I gotta put a... But the Carrion Night Sword has been passed down for generations!
[66:23.02]The Carrion Nightblade is like so... it's so regal and look at its... Quote best in the game.
[66:31.07]Yeah, I know that's subjective.
[66:37.77]Well, I need to go investigate that because if that's the case... If that's the case, then I might have to actually use it.
[66:45.16]I need to see how much damage that magic part of it does though.
[66:53.97]Well, that's really cool.
[66:59.87]Passed down for generations.
[67:01.55]Well, I mean, I... Yeah, this wasn't passed down to me.
[67:04.24]I took it off of some guy.
[67:09.16]Oh, passed down for generations.
[67:10.96]I kind of just took this off a guy's body.
[67:15.16]Oh, do I really?
[67:16.06]Am I that attached?
[67:19.77]Okay.
[67:20.41]Okay.
[67:27.41]I need to do an investigative work here.
[67:30.13]It's not going to do that much damage because I don't have enough to... I need one point in strength.
[67:35.72]But... How much damage does that do?
[67:40.68]173.
[67:43.08]How big is the arc?
[67:48.39]I'm fat rolling.
[67:48.97]I got too much shit on.
[67:58.15]That's a big arc.
[67:58.83]Are you serious, dude?
[68:05.76]I'm legally not even allowed to have this on right now, and I'm still doing this damn thing.
[68:11.22]Alright, no more testing.
[68:23.51]I don't know.
[68:27.67]I don't know.
[68:28.19]You're two-handing it so you get the benefits?
[68:33.96]Oh, alright.
[68:34.66]Okay, okay.
[68:41.30]Dual Weld.
[68:42.58]It looks cool.
[68:43.50]It is cool.
[68:44.22]It's like a... It's like a... It's see-through.
[68:50.03]It's like bubbles.
[68:52.55]It's like styro- I have a Styrofoam sword.
[68:54.77]This is kind of weird.
[68:57.65]It's just styrofoam.
[68:58.67]Am I sure this is actually hurting people?
[69:10.93]Do not use it.
[69:11.83]Alright, let me... I want to see what it takes to upgrade.
[69:15.83]Because I can have a couple weapons, right?
[69:17.77]But let me... Alright, let me clear this from... I did that.
[69:21.49]Clear.
[69:24.23]Bro, watch out.
[69:25.13]There's a snake.
[69:27.23]Fucking kidding me, dude.
[69:28.05]Are you kidding me?
[69:40.70]See through brain Andy.
[69:43.04]Let me clear that.
[69:44.36]And then... Alright.
[69:46.36]Do I go back to the smith?
[69:47.44]Is there anything else over here that I marked?
[69:51.40]I don't think so.
[69:51.92]No.
[69:53.18]I just had a panic attack for one second.
[69:56.12]I actually thought... I actually thought that I was going here.
[70:00.30]I was like, oh, I have to go fight that guy on the... The Redan guy.
[70:03.62]Oh, I beat him.
[70:06.84]Thank God.
[70:07.24]Alright, what was next on the list?
[70:09.39]Of, like, my cleanup list?
[70:14.25]Here.
[70:14.67]I wanted to see what this was.
[70:16.27]So we're gonna go there.
[70:23.10]Yeah, I did.
[70:23.54]I fight, I fight, I fight in Verdun.
[70:25.92]And he, he, that wouldn't take me about three or four hours to beat him.
[70:30.21]Planning all the way.
[70:31.99]Hating the game the whole way.
[70:39.25]So this way.
[70:41.05]I get up.
[70:43.35]Oh, no, never mind.
[70:44.27]I don't, is there even a way to get up there?
[70:49.21]It doesn't look like it.
[70:50.13]I don't think I can get there from here.
[70:53.36]Maybe I have to go from here?
[70:55.34]Ah, whatever.
[70:55.82]Okay.
[70:56.50]Alright, never mind.
[70:57.70]Where's the re?
[70:59.44]Re was this!
[71:00.14]I was like, what's this thing?
[71:01.14]This is kind of a weird thing.
[71:02.24]What's that?
[71:03.06]Let's go find out.
[71:18.33]Can you please play LEGO GTA?
[71:24.47]What a stupid game that is.
[71:31.76]Finish Ronnie's quest.
[71:33.28]Yeah, after I clean up these waypoints, I'm going to go to the smith.
[71:37.46]I'm going to see what I have available.
[71:39.72]I'm going to see if I want to potentially upgrade that katana.
[71:45.63]I also need 12 strength.
[71:49.07]I don't know.
[71:49.77]I'm not sure yet.
[71:51.47]It's definitely available.
[71:54.09]Alright, so what is here?
[71:58.99]Play Lego Elden Ring.
[72:06.68]Let's explore this island.
[72:12.44]Frames are still dropping.
[72:13.79]Yeah, they are, and they're going to continue to.
[72:16.67]It's something going on with the Twitch servers right now.
[72:22.81]I have confirmed it is not my internet.
[72:28.61]This.
[72:32.27]Seek three wise beasts.
[72:40.26]Tetsu's Rise.
[72:42.60]You must solve the puzzle to enter.
[72:49.50]Seek three wise beasts.
[72:53.56]Oh, we're just never doing this one.
[73:04.99]Kill three turtles.
[73:11.43]oh my god the whole island is here thank god get off me
[73:36.46]How many people are just going to spawn here?
[73:38.12]I mean, I'll take the souls.
[73:42.41]Did it just not stop?
[73:47.87]Do I just farm here for a minute?
[73:49.31]Why not?
[73:49.63]I'm just going to farm here.
[74:00.44]What?
[74:00.78]Oh, I thought I had the sword out.
[74:05.77]Oh my god, Dremel.
[74:16.14]What?
[74:16.38]They're not giving you any souls?
[74:18.16]Are they not?
[74:20.76]65?
[74:20.90]That's a lot.
[74:21.44]That's not bad.
[74:24.46]That's not bad.
[74:25.06]It actually is not bad.
[74:26.34]Yeah, you're right.
[74:26.82]Let's get out of here.
[74:27.34]Alright, well I can't do whatever this is.
[74:35.36]But I can check the back.
[74:47.43]I don't think I can do this yet.
[74:48.37]Nope.
[74:52.47]Okay.
[74:53.19]Well, that's cool.
[74:54.87]Uh... Is this a magic turtle?
[74:58.41]Find three wise beasts!
[74:59.79]That's a turtle right there!
[75:02.76]What do I do?
[75:06.46]Is that it?
[75:09.32]It's definitely fine.
[75:10.24]Three wise beasts.
[75:11.92]It's actually turtle.
[75:14.38]It actually is, isn't it?
[75:16.48]You gotta be kidding me.
[75:17.82]After all the shit that we just talked, is it?
[75:24.34]Oh, that was kind of mean.
[75:26.82]That's what it is.
[75:27.72]Oh my god, it's actually that.
[75:30.48]It's kill the three wise beasts.
[75:32.95]It's the turtles.
[75:37.13]And then that's gonna open.
[75:38.25]Alright.
[75:38.77]Where's the other turtles?
[75:39.74]That was one.
[75:45.06]They're just hiding in random trees or something.
[76:02.13]Come on.
[76:02.97]Where are you?
[76:03.85]I know there's more.
[76:15.79]Two.
[76:16.15]Where's three?
[76:39.44]Everybody see three?
[76:52.25]I don't know.
[76:54.27]This side?
[76:54.75]It's gotta be here.
[76:56.35]Like right here somewhere.
[77:10.26]Where's this third turtle?
[77:26.95]On the beach maybe?
[77:27.65]Over in the rocks.
[77:46.19]Where the hell are you?
[77:47.03]I dunno.
[77:54.77]Behind you.
[78:01.53]There's one more turtle.
[78:02.95]I need to find it.
[78:26.28]Oh shit!
[78:45.85]I have to get them again.
[78:46.45]I just reset it.
[78:58.69]Where the fuck were they?
[79:01.37]Where were they?
[79:02.07]Where were they?
[79:03.63]I don't remember.
[79:04.35]Object permanence.
[79:10.19]Where is this last turtle?
[79:44.54]Look over the east cliff.
[79:46.06]Thank you.
[79:47.04]Thank you.
[79:48.20]I'm not playing Where's Waldo for like another fucking five minutes.
[79:51.66]East cliff?
[79:56.85]This is the east cliff.
[79:57.71]Right here.
[80:07.25]I fucking swear to god damn god, man.
[80:09.39]Just teleport quick before I fall off.
[80:13.44]I have to start the puzzle again?
[80:24.63]I'm just gonna sprint as fast as I can.
[80:28.31]Oh, it's because I have to activate it.
[80:29.99]Right.
[80:30.51]Okay, because all those guys didn't spawn.
[80:32.83]Seek three wise beasts.
[80:36.62]Ah.
[80:36.76]Okay, where are they?
[80:40.16]Oh.
[80:40.90]Where are they?
[80:45.66]I was waiting for one of them to go, Oh, I'm awake.
[80:52.88]They always sleep and they always wake up and they have a white beard.
[80:55.16]Where are they?
[81:13.60]There's the dog mouth, too.
[81:15.40]It's like... Alright, let me at least get the other ones.
[81:27.08]This last one's gonna be like a suction cup down a wall.
[81:29.40]I know it.
[81:30.16]It's gonna be so stupid.
[81:36.59]Are you sure that they are... I reset it?
[81:39.25]Because I don't see the one in the tree anymore.
[82:02.22]He's in a bush next to the stairs.
[82:07.90]You lying motherfucker.
[82:21.79]There's no turtle in this bush, dude.
[82:23.75]It's off the side of a cliff.
[82:29.59]Southwest cliff.
[82:30.53]Southwest cliff.
[82:31.35]Southwest cliff.
[82:32.80]Southwest cliff.
[82:43.24]Oh my goodness gracious.
[82:47.06]I have a confession to make.
[82:49.18]I thought that was a sickle on the compass, and I was wondering what the hell that was the whole game.
[82:54.74]It's S.
[83:04.80]Southwest cliff.
[83:10.62]I thought that was like a sickle.
[83:12.23]And it was like, oh, this is some kind of a sickle enemy or a sickle thing.
[83:15.91]I don't know what it was.
[83:17.25]That doesn't look like an S. Okay, southwest cliff.
[83:21.80]This is southwest.
[83:22.74]Here's the cliff.
[83:25.02]Right?
[83:25.42]This southwestern cliff.
[83:37.34]I hear magical sounds.
[83:45.80]Near the edge.
[83:50.02]I'm just gonna look out through here.
[83:56.81]Stop throwing.
[83:58.67]I'm looking for a turtle that is randomly in a spot here and I can't find this little bastard, okay?
[84:07.00]Southwest cliff.
[84:09.60]Why am I still in combat?
[84:10.66]I can't even look at my fucking map.
[84:20.69]Wrong side.
[84:21.78]This is the southwestern... Look at the compass!
[84:25.24]It's just...
[84:50.24]Where the fuck is this thing?
[85:06.37]It's not on a cliff.
[85:08.35]Look at the map.
[85:13.09]I know.
[85:13.49]I know.
[85:13.85]I feel like people are fucking baiting me.
[85:18.31]I need to- I'm gonna circle the whole goddamn island.
[85:23.02]I'm not- Dude!
[85:23.98]Southwest cliff!
[85:25.18]Yeah, last time I did that, I fell off the edge.
[85:34.22]This- I am at the southwest part of the map right now.
[85:39.79]I don't see a turtle.
[85:44.97]You mean out here?
[85:47.07]He just looked at it?
[86:09.84]Flying above you.
[86:11.52]No, it is not.
[86:13.32]It's not a blimp.
[86:14.48]It's a turtle.
[86:28.49]Go on the cliff.
[86:31.44]I am at sea level right... I'm not supposed to be yelling.
[86:35.80]I'm currently at sea level right now.
[86:39.94]South cliff, look down.
[86:44.13]There's no cliff on the southwestern part.
[86:47.04]South cliff, look down.
[86:48.48]I'm gonna listen to that person.
[87:06.87]There's no southern cliff.
[87:08.31]It all leads down to sea level.
[87:12.65]Where are you?
[87:15.09]Where are you?
[87:26.78]Dude, it was right there.
[87:27.90]Right side of the tower.
[87:29.00]Run along the edge.
[87:32.18]The edge of the tower or the edge of the map, like the cliff?
[87:38.08]What a stupid motherfucker.
[88:01.20]I thought... I thought he was gonna be like... Like suctioned on the edge.
[88:19.18]Okay.
[88:20.34]I get it.
[88:21.34]What's in here?
[88:21.86]This is very intriguing.
[88:25.36]Very intriguing.
[88:29.06]Seek three wise beasts.
[88:30.62]I can't believe it was wise beasts.
[88:32.10]We just had a whole rant about that.
[88:34.30]Okay, so what the hell's here?
[88:49.43]Do you think, oh, question mark, question mark, do you think turtles have suction powers?
[88:52.65]LOL, what an idiot.
[88:54.95]One of them was in a fucking tree.
[89:00.34]I don't know very many tortoises that can climb trees and get to the top of the fucking tree.
[89:10.14]What's that for your logic?
[89:20.06]Ooh, wait.
[89:21.50]Ooh, hold on.
[89:22.16]Can I get over there?
[89:24.46]Ooh, look at this.
[89:29.34]Ooh, look what's over here.
[89:30.10]Nothing.
[89:34.73]Really?
[89:35.03]Come on.
[89:35.33]Is there something I can do about this?
[89:38.91]Heard the shot.
[89:39.47]Wait, eluciary wall.
[89:45.55]Don't tell him what to do.
[89:48.69]Let him lose on his own.
[89:50.05]Okay, fine.
[89:54.57]That's interesting.
[89:55.41]Gonna be a teleporter.
[90:00.77]Oh, another spell.
[90:01.93]Another memory stone.
[90:02.75]That's it?
[90:03.77]That's kind of cool.
[90:05.37]That's kind of cool.
[90:08.17]It's a little puzzle to get a memory stone.
[90:15.13]This is definitely a place where online messages make a big difference, yeah.
[90:26.88]Lugadeez is probably the hardest boss in the game.
[90:29.62]Oh, I hear.
[90:30.69]Yeah, yeah.
[90:31.57]General Lugadeez.
[90:33.47]That guy's nuts.
[90:35.15]Crazy.
[90:35.77]That's a crazy fight.
[90:46.09]Okay, so that's cool.
[90:47.89]I did want to check that out.
[90:49.07]I wanted to see what that was.
[90:51.23]I also wanted to see what this was before we continue on our main quest here.
[90:56.34]I'm very curious what that boulder thing is.
[91:04.40]Very curious about it.
[91:12.54]Are we in the end game now?
[91:13.56]No.
[91:14.40]I don't think we'll be in the end game for quite a while.
[91:19.02]Alright, what is this big boulder?
[91:30.22]Royal Grave Evergale.
[91:32.72]Go to Evergale.
[91:33.44]Yes.
[91:34.24]Yes.
[91:55.16]Alabaster Lord?
[91:56.24]Where did this guy come from?
[92:09.77]Oh shit.
[92:10.81]That's alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, Mr. Lord.
[92:34.01]Not bad.
[92:34.39]I got magic of my own.
[92:36.33]Let's see how it works against you.
[92:41.79]That staggered him too.
[92:42.69]Hold on.
[92:43.01]Let's get a better one.
[92:50.57]Did that not even hurt me?
[92:52.67]Oh, that did.
[92:53.29]Alright.
[92:53.75]No more fucking around.
[92:55.59]No more testing.
[92:56.21]No more theories.
[93:02.54]Let's go.
[93:14.03]In phase two?
[93:25.74]Ow.
[93:31.99]Ow.
[93:32.91]Okay, so that doesn't do damage, but just knocks you down.
[93:40.75]Oh, fuck.
[93:41.55]Okay, he kind of traversed a long way.
[93:44.54]Oh, boy.
[93:45.06]This is bad.
[94:17.71]Alright, that wasn't that bad.
[94:20.50]Alabaster Lord.
[94:30.78]Be to your right.
[94:38.79]Cool.
[94:41.31]That's just a boss.
[94:43.26]It's just like a phantom boss thing.
[94:45.42]Let me see what that looks like.
[94:50.86]I can use this now, 30 in.
[94:51.72]Call small meteorites down from the sky.
[94:56.06]Summons a void that emits a rain of small meteorites.
[94:58.04]Hold to continue the effect.
[95:01.67]I definitely want to try it.
[95:03.93]Wait, you haven't done any... I didn't even know that existed.
[95:08.45]How many more of these are there?
[95:10.47]Is that the first ever gull he's seen?
[95:12.15]Yeah.
[95:16.65]There's a lot of these?
[95:17.66]There are dozens of these.
[95:20.62]Okay, let me ask a question.
[95:22.14]I have a question for everybody watching.
[95:24.34]Did I, like... Because I spent a lot of time exploring in the first stream or two.
[95:31.03]Did I just go the route to avoid every single possible interesting thing?
[95:38.78]How did I miss everything?
[95:41.64]I did so much exploring.
[95:45.88]I did a bunch of dungeons, and I looked down here, the burnt ruins.
[95:50.21]I didn't find any of this stuff.
[95:52.55]It was a required item that I was supposed to find.
[95:55.65]I just didn't even know it existed until literally fucking 12 hours ago.
[96:00.87]I can't fight these?
[96:12.02]Okay.
[96:13.50]Well, that's cool.
[96:15.28]You explored armpits when the full body was exposed.
[96:19.86]That's weird.
[96:21.06]That was a weird thing.
[96:21.78]I don't even know what I just said.
[96:22.56]That was a weird thing to say.
[96:24.24]That was a very weird thing to say.
[96:25.56]I don't even know what you're saying.
[96:26.50]That was weird.
[96:28.16]That was a very odd way to put that.
[96:29.64]I don't know.
[96:30.26]It's freaking me out.
[96:33.29]You explored the armpits when the whole body was exposed.
[96:37.91]What's that supposed to mean?
[96:39.83]What's that supposed to mean?
[96:42.47]That's freaking me out.
[96:43.37]I don't know what that means.
[96:45.35]Did you expect a serious answer?
[96:47.09]Yes.
[96:47.57]I know this is a very serious community.
[96:50.74]Okay.
[96:53.84]Pretty cool.
[96:54.28]I think I've tied up all the loose ends.
[96:57.62]There's one more loose end that I want to tie up and I just want to get the map fragment for here because it's like, come on.
[97:03.18]Really?
[97:03.42]Try the meteor?
[97:08.10]Yeah.
[97:09.62]Yeah.
[97:10.61]You want me to try the meteor?
[97:11.89]Okay.
[97:12.77]I'll try it.
[97:13.41]Okay.
[97:13.75]Sure.
[97:14.51]Okay.
[97:15.69]Sure.
[97:19.41]Let's see what it does.
[97:29.28]Okay.
[97:39.56]She's in random directions?
[97:45.25]Oh, this is fucking terrible.
[97:47.13]Hold on.
[97:47.53]Does it... If I lock on, will it... Let's test it over here.
[97:53.39]I wonder if I lock on.
[97:58.68]Alright, let's see what happens here.
[98:05.42]That might be the worst move in the game.
[98:20.06]I didn't hit any single person?
[98:32.17]It's probably good against big enemies.
[98:33.55]I guess maybe if you cast it right in front of them, maybe.
[98:35.67]That does a lot.
[98:45.70]I thought it was a different spell.
[98:50.46]I thought it was one that, like, shot little ones.
[98:52.30]It says small meteors.
[98:53.55]Those are huge.
[98:57.01]Okay, well, it's not very good, but maybe it'll be good in random scenarios.
[99:01.79]I need... I'm gonna get to 25 vigor.
[99:03.91]Do I have enough, um... I don't.
[99:12.37]Uh, so what... What...
[99:16.11]Ooh, wait.
[99:16.71]I got a new great rune.
[99:19.97]What does, um, Rodan's great rune do?
[99:24.41]Avoid of any benediction.
[99:25.73]Seek the Divine Tower of Caelid, which stands upon the... I think I have to talk to the finger lady.
[99:31.67]Yeah, let's go talk to the finger lady.
[99:32.99]Upgrade strength.
[99:36.44]Wait.
[99:36.64]Do what I came here for.
[99:41.78]I could, yeah, I could go to the dragon thing.
[99:44.68]But those are all faith moves.
[99:50.54]And Redan's Soul Weapons, yeah.
[99:56.89]Let me get the Map Fragment.
[100:04.86]Should do the Katana.
[100:06.48]I'm going to make a very, very hard decision.
[100:08.74]Gonna make a decision.
[100:14.78]Not gonna be easy.
[100:25.52]Okay, Lunaria East.
[100:29.00]Finally, I can see what the hell's going on here.
[100:30.69]I wonder how much further up this goes.
[100:39.71]You know what I mean, Vern?
[100:46.22]Alright, time to head back to the blacksmith and make some decisions.
[101:00.54]This is not going to be easy.
[101:13.63]I don't have enough to level up one time.
[101:17.33]But I could get it pretty easily.
[101:22.99]I also need to... Let me do this while I'm here as well.
[101:25.24]Greetings.
[101:25.78]Are you here for spirits?
[101:28.45]something you should know I need to warn you about something a little while ago someone started lurking in the wing on the opposite side of the round table and I can hear from all the way over there the howling and wailing of spirits in fear of a curse I can even hear the repulsive twisted malice in itself a plethora of spirits in an unceasing cacophony I can't even imagine
[101:56.09]How much suffering inflicted to who knows how many souls.
[101:59.83]Not even the crafting caused anything like this to happen.
[102:02.83]You should keep your distance.
[102:04.29]I know you're strong, but please.
[102:06.63]Wait, what?
[102:09.06]I'd like to ask you a small favor.
[102:10.82]Is there like a boss in here?
[102:11.84]Can you take this little one along with you?
[102:14.04]This little one?
[102:14.74]They can't be summoned here, but the spirits look rather fondly upon you.
[102:19.20]Wait, you want to give me a little friend?
[102:20.30]I'll be glad of your company, I think.
[102:22.82]The little one.
[102:25.49]Spirit Jellyfish.
[102:32.28]Alright, let's get the boys up.
[102:37.68]I need Ghost Glovewort 2 to even do Oleg.
[102:46.61]Boys level 3.
[102:49.05]I'll do the wolves as well.
[103:02.08]Level the boys up?
[103:02.78]Yeah.
[103:04.00]I'm curious what she's talking about.
[103:05.57]I'm gonna go take a look.
[103:11.97]Alright, so... I... Smithing Stone... Somber Smithing Stone 6.
[103:19.34]Is what I need to get this to plus 6.
[103:23.08]I also need to start... Upgrade... I gotta get this upgraded.
[103:26.58]My stealing is such shit.
[103:29.99]What does it take to get the katana upgraded?
[103:34.69]Also Somber Smithing Stone.
[104:01.29]That's C scaling.
[104:02.32]C and C. Alright, alright, alright.
[104:11.92]Hold on.
[104:12.30]This is 150, 150 plus 29, 38.
[104:13.64]The scaling is so much higher.
[104:32.70]And with the strength, it would be, it'll be fine.
[104:34.92]It does more.
[104:38.26]137 plus 62.
[104:38.72]Plus the bleed.
[104:44.59]Yeah, I'm gonna put a point in strength.
[104:46.71]It's, yeah.
[104:47.97]It's time to put the, uh, carry a night sword to rest.
[104:51.07]Because that's D and D scaling.
[104:53.59]This is C and C scaling.
[104:55.35]It's like, well, is this a no-brainer?
[105:03.05]That's a no-brainer.
[105:06.48]I'm gonna miss this little guy.
[105:12.58]But this thing just seems way too good.
[105:15.42]Alright, I just need a point in strength.
[105:16.96]And... I'm also going to do this too.
[105:24.95]Because where's that staff that I want to eventually use?
[105:29.45]It's here.
[105:30.85]Okay.
[105:32.88]Somber Smithing Stone.
[105:34.58]I can do it again.
[105:36.76]Get this to plus four.
[105:38.34]Which I'm going to do.
[105:41.36]I want to equip... This is almost an S scaling, bro.
[105:48.22]My current staff does not use somber smithing stones.
[105:51.69]So I'm just going to use the regular ones on here.
[105:53.23]So I need...
[106:01.57]I need six.
[106:07.57]Okay.
[106:12.44]Uh, bro.
[106:13.98]Okay, now I've got to... What do I gotta do now?
[106:19.72]What was I gonna do?
[106:24.73]What the hell am I doing?
[106:26.75]There's something very specific I wanted to do.
[106:29.65]What was it?
[106:30.25]Oh, the boss soul.
[106:34.17]And the finger lady.
[106:36.57]Go find out what the deal is.
[106:44.12]Alright, what's the Rodan boss soul?
[106:45.86]Because I'll just crush it.
[106:46.64]Okay, this is just a huge strength weapon.
[106:56.86]And a bow, though.
[106:57.70]That's kind of cool.
[107:00.11]Iron Greatbow.
[107:03.30]Starcaller Cry.
[107:04.70]Bring the... Wait, it's two swords?
[107:12.28]You pull people... You pull them in.
[107:17.06]The Greatbow is pretty pog.
[107:20.68]Redon's Rain.
[107:21.86]Archery skill performed from a low stance.
[107:25.16]Oh, it shoots... It does the arrow move.
[107:28.42]Sucks.
[107:28.86]Okay.
[107:29.36]I'm just going to crush it for souls.
[107:38.89]That's really cool, though.
[107:44.13]No, don't.
[107:44.97]What?
[107:45.07]What do you mean, don't?
[107:49.37]Why is everybody going, no, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't?
[107:53.89]Why not?
[107:59.46]Wait, what?
[108:05.78]What are you talking about?
[108:08.90]Okay, what are you going to start with?
[108:18.22]That's a lot.
[108:19.76]Okay, that actually just helps me a lot big time.
[108:21.88]Alright, so we can get strength.
[108:28.83]Yeah, if you're not going to use the boss weapon, then just get rid of it.
[108:31.84]What's the point?
[108:34.80]One point in strength.
[108:35.92]And I can do one point in strength and we'll do... I'll get 25 vitality.
[108:42.26]Good.
[108:43.37]Alright.
[108:44.45]We've got a new weapon.
[108:46.23]And I'm ready to check it out.
[108:58.32]Somebody do some math with me here, though.
[109:00.66]I need a calculator.
[109:01.46]137 plus 62.
[109:02.64]That's... That's... 67, 80, 90.
[109:03.30]That's 199.
[109:03.58]And 115.
[109:03.78]That's 29.
[109:03.98]125, 35.
[109:04.54]36, 37, 38, 49, 41, 42, 43, 44.
[109:04.82]144 and 199.
[109:05.52]Versus... 181, 190.
[109:29.20]But it has bleed.
[109:31.20]And it's also has the magic built into.
[109:38.76]It's close.
[109:40.64]This also is not leveled up.
[109:49.83]Oh, it just says it there.
[109:51.49]That's cool.
[109:56.64]Okay.
[109:56.84]Okay.
[110:00.88]372.
[110:00.90]344.
[110:06.24]Okay.
[110:10.35]But, it does have the bleed, and it's also plus 4 when the carrion sword is plus 5.
[110:20.23]So, fuck it.
[110:20.89]Let's go.
[110:22.03]I'll use it.
[110:23.62]Now, very important.
[110:27.19]I need to talk to you about something.
[110:31.05]I can get his helmet?
[110:43.11]That's kind of cool.
[110:47.53]I can also get his lion armor.
[110:49.05]Holy shit, that's a lot of defense.
[110:52.95]Look at the robustness.
[110:59.45]Increases intelligence?
[111:00.55]By how much?
[111:05.80]By how much?
[111:06.28]Because this thing increases intelligence, but it makes me slower.
[111:25.54]My stamina is gone.
[111:33.53]It's the same.
[111:34.41]Okay, but hold on.
[111:35.37]So I get my stamina back.
[111:47.03]Fucking idiot.
[111:48.51]This is gonna distr... I'm gonna tell you, this is distracting.
[111:53.15]This is very distracting.
[111:59.04]That's going to... It's like... It's in the way.
[112:07.61]It's actually in the way.
[112:09.96]You look like a coat hanger.
[112:11.18]I look like a moron.
[112:15.66]And it takes up too much of the screen real estate.
[112:18.06]I don't like it.
[112:18.50]You're a fucking idiot.
[112:28.44]Well, I have to, like, put on other clothes then, right?
[112:39.25]I just look like I'm about to go to sleep.
[112:42.98]I'm wearing pajamas.
[112:44.06]This is like, okay, back in the 1910s, this is like the pajamas that people would wear.
[112:49.45]They'd wear like the pajama hat and pajamas.
[112:56.61]Okay, well, whatever.
[112:58.43]It is actually statistically better than what I had on.
[113:06.10]Put the carrion knight stuff back on.
[113:08.80]I'll keep the dunce cap on.
[113:22.61]Now I got my new weapon.
[113:24.63]I've got my new stuff.
[113:26.25]It's time to continue the video game.
[113:29.79]And that means go find the shooting star.
[113:33.55]That landed down here somewhere.
[113:36.56]Gonna continue Ranny's quest.
[113:40.54]You look like a Frito.
[113:55.03]Okay, I definitely don't want that.
[113:56.97]I'll put this on you.
[113:59.61]Alright, let's go like here.
[114:01.85]We're looking for a star, a fallen star.
[114:08.88]If anybody sees it, please let me know.
[114:20.07]Right there.
[114:21.15]Look in the sky.
[114:21.83]And it would be on the ground.
[114:43.47]There's something here, man.
[114:44.41]Hold on.
[114:49.52]Oh!
[114:49.60]I thought that was a bush.
[114:54.00]I thought that was a bush.
[114:55.04]Oh!
[115:09.91]He's stuck in the thing.
[115:11.17]He's actually stuck in the wall.
[115:13.21]Perfect.
[115:22.23]Holy shit, this thing's fucking incredible.
[115:23.73]This weapon is unbelievable.
[115:33.48]There's a place to go down here.
[115:41.24]Very cool.
[115:41.58]Let's do it.
[115:43.60]Katana, good.
[115:44.46]Katana, good.
[115:45.16]Yes.
[115:45.60]Katana, very good.
[115:48.10]Well, let me preface that by saying, magic katana, very good.
[115:56.18]Axe talisman?
[116:02.31]Enhances charge attacks.
[116:04.97]That doesn't count for like this, right?
[116:09.52]It's only this.
[116:16.28]That's really cool.
[116:22.79]It's just R2 attacks.
[116:23.83]Okay.
[116:24.21]That's still cool though.
[116:24.81]I feel like I would want to remember that for me strong.
[116:31.19]Because holding R2 with like a big gigantic club.
[116:35.23]Because that's the weapon I'm going to use.
[116:36.67]The big huge like turkey leg.
[116:39.99]Alright, well that was cool.
[116:42.35]Very cool.
[116:46.99]Alright, looking for a star.
[116:51.87]Shooting star.
[116:58.09]East.
[117:00.00]East.
[117:06.61]I feel like it would be glowing and really, really visible on like the whole map, right?
[117:10.89]I don't think this is something that I have to go searching for desperately.
[117:17.89]Or maybe I do.
[117:18.51]Maybe it's tiny.
[117:23.97]Is that it?
[117:36.68]It looks like... I'm down here?
[117:43.35]Did I make a big crater?
[117:44.39]Can I jump down there?
[117:52.12]Go down.
[117:52.68]Jump.
[117:53.70]Is that... Is this gonna kill me?
[118:00.17]I thought... Okay, I thought I was gonna break through like a magical realm or something.
[118:05.98]I thought it was gonna be a magical realm, I didn't know.
[118:15.52]Oh fuck, that's far away.
[118:16.52]How do I get down?
[118:21.61]There's literally a path down there.
[118:24.27]Oh, I don't know dude.
[118:31.29]This guy's got literal brain rot.
[118:34.40]I don't... Look, I don't know.
[118:36.22]It looks very magical down there.
[118:39.16]Plus, there was a shitload of fog.
[118:43.95]It's not so foggy right now.
[118:46.03]Do you see how much fog was covering this whole thing?
[118:48.11]I can actually see now.
[118:54.68]What?
[119:07.27]It was like a thousand ruins or something.
[119:12.06]The fall damage in this game, I gotta tell you, I don't make much sense to me.
[119:17.64]You either die or you take like five damage.
[119:27.67]This is where I jumped from.
[119:29.23]That's not that far.
[119:37.90]That's not that far.
[119:40.90]That was a Reddit comment?
[119:49.35]This is crazy though.
[120:02.49]This is cool.
[120:09.00]Oh, I gotta go over there?
[121:36.51]Do you guys spend on magical down here?
[121:39.63]What?
[121:39.93]I thought it was magical.
[121:47.96]I thought it was like magical or something.
[121:49.98]Like there's nowhere else to go.
[121:51.20]Where else do you go?
[121:56.06]He's always frowning.
[122:08.10]I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing here.
[122:09.94]I definitely have to go this way.
[122:42.53]I don't understand where.
[122:52.39]DON'T DO IT AGAIN!
[122:55.18]I'm getting laughed at.
[123:06.32]I'm getting actually laughed at.
[123:09.20]I'm getting laughed at.
[123:35.49]Dude, just play Worms.
[123:39.65]Okay, what's happening?
[123:41.89]What keeps happening here?
[123:45.38]This game's too hard!
[123:46.84]This game's too hard.
[123:48.16]Alright, what keep- what the fuck actually keeps happening to me?
[123:52.54]I don't- what's going on here?
[123:54.64]I keep getting here and then my brain goes nowhere, go lose.
[123:57.77]That way.
[123:59.07]Left?
[124:00.43]See how fucking foggy it is here?
[124:05.62]Dude, it's so foggy.
[124:07.06]I couldn't see this.
[124:16.17]It's too foggy.
[124:16.93]I couldn't see it.
[124:26.22]Are you molding?
[124:27.60]Yeah, dude.
[124:31.40]Oh.
[124:32.88]Oh.
[124:46.43]Oh, yes.
[124:54.09]Are you balding?
[124:54.78]Yeah.
[124:57.80]Not that rapidly, though.
[124:59.00]I'll probably have here for a while.
[125:01.56]Probably into my, like, forties.
[125:02.68]There's gotta be a... a touchstone thing here, right?
[125:11.82]Bonfire?
[125:15.21]If there's not, then, like, I'm sorry, but the developers, like, seriously made a fucking big mistake.
[125:18.99]If there's not a bonfire down here, then, like, I mean, the devs just made a fucking massive mistake.
[125:26.16]And, like, if I was on, like, the team, I'd probably know how to fix it, you know what I mean?
[125:29.18]If I was, like, one of the devs, I would, like, know what to do.
[125:42.26]Like, this part here, like, I'm not a fucking big fan of that.
[125:45.40]Like, man, if I was on the team, I'd fix that quick.
[125:49.73]The small animation cancel at the end there, I would've fixed that.
[125:52.13]If I was on the team.
[126:09.81]What is he talking about?
[126:10.91]I'm doing the thing where, like, when you suck at Dark Souls, you talk about how, like, the game's not good, and you explain why, like, and how you're gonna fix it.
[126:21.63]And, like, you would know so much better.
[126:23.84]Oh, this is, we're now, okay, I get it.
[126:31.44]I get it.
[126:39.54]Be careful.
[126:40.58]Alright, dual headphones going in.
[126:47.24]You explained the joke, -2.
[126:50.37]Sometimes you have to, because people think I'm actually sitting here doing that.
[126:58.77]I- I'm sorry.
[127:05.94]I'm not gonna fall, no.
[127:13.88]I am going to look for, uh, Shriekwitch.
[127:19.52]Ew!
[127:19.80]Oh, ew!
[127:20.38]Oh, gross!
[127:21.14]Ew!
[127:21.32]What was that?
[127:33.51]People genuinely think Souls games are perfect.
[127:35.37]No, they're not.
[127:37.12]Absolutely not.
[127:39.70]Redan is in the game.
[127:40.78]It's not perfect.
[127:56.98]This is weird.
[128:01.00]Holy shit, I thought I just walked off the edge.
[128:07.58]Whoa.
[128:09.50]This is like the thing from Clay Fighter.
[128:11.36]The blob?
[128:11.80]What's his name?
[128:16.65]My goodness, be careful.
[128:23.05]Yup.
[128:24.99]Yup.
[128:26.77]Yup.
[128:35.52]Oh, pain.
[128:35.90]Hurt.
[128:36.46]Hurt.
[128:37.88]Hurt.
[128:38.10]Hurt.
[128:38.42]Hurt.
[128:38.86]Hurt.
[128:40.42]Whoever gets that reference, you're a real one.
[128:57.43]That's literally from Clay Fighter.
[128:58.81]We were just talking about it.
[128:59.85]I can't believe some people just don't get it.
[129:01.93]What's that?
[129:11.80]Silver Tear Husk?
[129:13.22]Stop doing that or I'm going to fucking tell on you.
[129:33.33]These guys are fucking terribly easy.
[129:36.35]Just get them.
[129:45.80]Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here!
[129:53.42]I still get it, right?
[129:54.52]I win, right?
[130:00.68]Ascent butterfly.
[130:01.66]Next game.
[130:26.47]I fall through this.
[130:29.99]Okay, for a second I thought I was avoiding that accidentally.
[130:35.79]One of them maybe you can go right through.
[130:37.01]I wouldn't be surprised.
[130:42.20]When is Elden Ring gonna come out?
[130:45.74]Um... I don't know, dude.
[130:47.37]Check your fucking local listings.
[130:48.69]Leave me the fucking alone.
[131:10.90]Go to Walmart.com and type in Elden Ring PC CD-ROM, okay?
[131:17.19]I don't know.
[131:17.63]I don't know when it's coming out.
[131:35.57]Is that what I need?
[131:37.29]No, it's Somber Smithing Stone 5.
[131:38.53]Fuck.
[131:42.47]Okay.
[131:48.28]Pretty cool.
[131:51.92]Who uses a CD?
[131:53.22]I don't know very many people that still have a CD drive on their computer.
[132:00.51]Uh, is this safe?
[132:06.90]I don't think this is safe.
[132:11.01]Is it?
[132:11.23]Kinda scared to do this.
[132:19.16]I don't think this is safe.
[132:24.60]It is.
[132:25.94]Kind of.
[132:30.90]Frames.
[132:31.36]Yeah, I don't... I'm sorry, guys.
[132:34.08]There's nothing I can do about it.
[132:35.10]If I could fix it, I would.
[132:38.83]Something with a lot of people on Twitch's connections streaming to Twitch right now is not good.
[132:48.31]That's seriously, like, un-fucking-believably good.
[133:08.67]Damn, that's good.
[133:19.89]It's better on mobile?
[133:21.55]Um, I- It's- It's my connection to Twitch.
[133:25.70]Whatever is wrong.
[133:28.43]But I would originally be kind of concerned about this.
[133:32.55]But according to what a lot of you guys have told me, this is not just a me problem.
[133:43.81]Because when I do a speed test, it's perfect.
[133:53.86]Okay, I can't level up or anything, so...
[133:58.70]Something I do want to do... I want to get rid of... This.
[134:03.06]Enhances left-hand shield damage... How much, though?
[134:07.78]By what?
[134:13.07]Either that, or... Maybe Starlight.
[134:16.09]I feel like I'll need it at some point.
[134:17.15]Okay.
[134:31.31]What about Glintstone Arc?
[134:32.83]I have Glintstone Arc as this weapon.
[134:36.77]So, I don't need it anymore because I have it baked into this weapon.
[134:41.53]It's pretty damn good.
[134:56.02]Something tells me I'm about to fight something here.
[134:59.49]I'm getting very concerned about it.
[135:01.13]Very concerned.
[135:11.55]Please don't curse.
[135:12.27]Yeah, alright.
[135:16.00]I'll do my best.
[135:16.60]If I think about cursing, I'll just unmute.
[135:30.20]Is this glove ward?
[135:31.00]It is.
[135:31.40]Ghost glove ward.
[135:32.82]That's exactly what I needed to upgrade Oleg.
[135:35.34]I don't know if it's exactly this one though.
[135:50.56]This is a boss area.
[135:51.56]It has to be.
[135:52.60]So let's prepare.
[136:02.27]audio is completely out of sync I think it's because the stream keeps like hiccuping and I think it's happening on the browser and I
[136:30.38]Oh, stop.
[136:31.52]Oh, stop it.
[136:32.68]Oh, stop.
[136:38.82]I don't know what happens if that fills up, but I don't want to find out.
[136:51.02]Oh, frost.
[136:51.74]It's frost.
[136:52.41]Okay.
[137:02.69]Though it just makes me slow.
[137:05.01]Not a big, not a big deal.
[137:09.47]Ghost Glovewort Picker's Bell Bearing.
[137:14.56]I can bring that to the store.
[137:18.44]That's kind of cool.
[137:19.10]Alright.
[137:19.30]I can bring that to the store.
[137:26.89]That's five times fast.
[137:29.23]Ghost pickle bell bearing.
[137:30.59]Ghost sword pickle bell bearing.
[137:31.75]I don't even know what it was.
[137:40.76]Pickle.
[137:41.02]Let's check this side.
[137:41.88]I don't want to miss anything.
[137:56.33]Oh, shit.
[137:56.75]Alright.
[137:59.05]I was close enough.
[138:01.85]Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat.
[138:11.19]That was a record, I think.
[138:12.37]On this channel, at least.
[138:24.06]That was probably at least ten plus times in a row.
[138:39.73]What other channels do that?
[138:42.77]I'm just saying in general.
[138:44.53]I can't claim to have the record because somebody probably did it a hundred times in a row.
[139:02.82]That's mad damage.
[139:07.68]That's actually just mad.
[139:09.10]That's mad damage.
[139:15.92]I like this area's music.
[139:16.94]It's very Bloodborne-y.
[139:19.62]I like...
[139:35.88]Great.
[139:38.08]One, two, that's five great shield boys.
[139:49.07]Interesting.
[139:50.99]Tank boys.
[139:51.73]Alright, so I can go in here or I can go down there.
[139:56.89]Let's see what's in here.
[140:12.82]Can't replace the boys.
[140:15.62]I can at least get them to plus three.
[140:18.62]Larval tier.
[140:19.82]Ooh.
[140:22.67]I'm going to do an item recap, essentially.
[140:25.77]I picked up a lot of stuff in the last hour.
[140:27.57]Okay, I think that's everything.
[140:33.24]I'm going to go down.
[140:35.60]There is a desync.
[140:38.16]I don't think there is.
[140:39.64]I think... I don't see it on my preview.
[140:44.06]I honestly think it's the internet shit that was happening with Twitch's servers.
[140:55.03]Oh shit.
[140:55.75]Okay, there's a boss here.
[140:58.81]One of those statues.
[141:03.10]Hmm... I think I level up first.
[141:07.68]Yeah, definitely.
[141:11.34]I have enough runes, I think, to put another point into intelligence, which is what I'm going to do.
[141:15.65]Oh, fuck, out of here.
[141:39.16]That's a big whip.
[141:41.93]Did I get the whip?
[141:55.26]You kissed Urba.
[142:03.35]I already have a whip.
[142:03.99]That was a different whip, though.
[142:06.29]That was a... That was like a chain.
[142:09.75]It almost looked magical.
[142:10.75]A magical whip would be kind of fun.
[142:18.70]Yeah, I definitely can level up for going in there.
[142:22.18]Without a doubt.
[142:23.32]So that's what we're going to do.
[142:28.72]Another larva.
[142:30.04]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[142:30.80]Tear.
[142:47.17]That's why I don't have the arc.
[142:48.81]Because I have it already.
[143:13.52]I think that's all I can do, but I'm going to level up.
[143:16.29]Unless... Because there's a statue back there, so that's what they want you to respawn after you die a multitude of times here.
[143:21.93]I do have to pee, too, so we're going to take a break.
[143:26.96]Before doing whatever the heck this is.
[143:35.75]Yeah.
[143:36.37]Alright, I'm going back to the bonfire.
[143:48.39]I gotta pee.
[143:50.65]Whoa, what did I just go?
[143:51.73]What?
[143:52.11]No, that's not what I wanted to do.
[143:53.81]What happened?
[143:54.37]What?
[143:54.55]That's the wrong one.
[143:58.78]What's the right one?
[144:02.98]This one here?
[144:03.48]Okay, yeah, this is the right one.
[144:11.76]Alright.
[144:13.38]Let me see if I can level up.
[144:15.00]Yeah, I have so many of these.
[144:17.19]It's gonna be 5k.
[144:17.51]23,000?
[144:17.53]24,000?
[144:17.63]I believe it's 24 or 23.
[144:42.98]23.
[144:43.00]Okay, I gotta kill a couple things.
[144:52.07]Hello, everybody.
[144:53.18]Agro everyone.
[145:09.30]A few more.
[145:17.78]Level up.
[145:18.62]P. What's wrong with having a zit?
[145:23.03]I've been very vocal about my zit.
[145:24.77]I've been very vocal about it.
[145:27.20]I'm not very happy about it.
[145:29.14]Gotta be honest.
[145:30.52]I'm very not happy about it.
[145:40.82]Alright.
[145:41.50]Level up now.
[145:44.10]One more for good luck.
[146:06.71]I think I just have to keep stacking intelligence.
[146:08.75]Because if I... I need 52.
[146:19.68]With the mask on.
[146:24.62]What do I have right now?
[146:26.08]With the helmet on.
[146:27.32]I think it's like 35.
[146:27.92]34. 34.
[146:37.17]Well, okay.
[146:37.55]I'm going to pee.
[146:39.85]I'll be right back.
[146:41.05]I'm going to maybe refill my drink.
[146:44.09]I will see you guys in two, three minutes.
[146:46.45]Yeah, because we're going to fight a boss.
[146:48.51]So we're about to be here for the long haul.
[146:52.94]See you guys in a moment.
[147:42.28]you

[155:46.22]I wouldn't rule that out just yet.
[155:47.88]Okay.
[155:50.16]Time to fight the boss.
[155:52.87]Let's do it.
[155:54.07]Let's go here.
[155:55.49]Double headphones.
[155:56.43]Gonna need it.
[155:58.27]Stretch the back.
[155:59.45]Move the back.
[156:00.85]Lean forward.
[156:02.03]Pulse.
[156:02.67]Okay.
[156:05.75]So, who is this?
[156:06.63]Who am I fighting?
[156:09.34]Maybe I should take off the... Well, let's just see who the boss is.
[156:13.34]Let's find out what it is.
[156:19.09]Because I'm either going to do all katana or I'll switch it up a little.
[156:29.60]Is the statue right here?
[156:30.92]Right.
[156:31.16]Yep.
[156:31.42]I'm going to make sure I look at it so I get it.
[156:35.48]Okay.
[156:35.72]Let's go.
[156:40.68]Oh my god.
[156:41.16]I forgot you were here.
[156:43.47]I was not even looking.
[156:45.05]Oh well.
[156:47.70]Alright.
[156:48.78]Remember, I gotta jump over that.
[156:50.02]I don't want to aggro these guys.
[156:59.31]I don't care.
[156:59.67]I may have lost a flask, but whatever.
[157:02.47]I just want to see what the boss does.
[157:04.49]We gotta get a picture of what's going on here.
[157:09.17]Let's go.
[157:30.74]blob just died oh it turned into me mimicked here oh this one person I know more than anybody it's me
[158:02.63]I wouldn't have done that.
[158:03.41]That's how I know you're a fake.
[158:10.03]What's something that I would hate?
[158:13.18]Oh, I know.
[158:16.54]Slow fucking moves.
[158:19.78]Yup.
[158:20.02]Uuuhhhh...
[158:38.67]Right now he's fucking screaming in his chair.
[158:47.38]God damn it, come on!
[158:58.44]Yeah, all your moves suck.
[158:59.92]That's how I know I'm gonna beat you.
[159:02.42]Your character sucks.
[159:05.80]Dude, your character's awful.
[159:21.79]Hold on.
[159:22.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[159:30.32]Ooh, nice moves, Jeremy.
[159:31.90]Good moves.
[159:32.66]Very cool.
[159:41.91]Fuck!
[159:46.03]You're out of potions.
[159:46.97]You're an idiot.
[159:54.35]When's he gonna let go of it?
[159:55.43]I don't know the timing on this.
[159:57.03]I don't fucking understand tim- Ooh, good one.
[160:00.03]Good.
[160:00.59]Okay, you're learning.
[160:03.57]Okay.
[160:17.01]See how long it just took him to do that?
[160:21.41]Alright, no more messing around.
[160:22.37]Time to die.
[160:33.45]Marvel tier.
[160:37.99]Silver tier mask?
[160:39.25]What is that?
[160:39.77]It's like a clay mask.
[160:50.76]Greatly increases arcane to the detriment of physical attack power.
[161:00.06]By how much?
[161:00.62]17 versus... Oh my god, that's a lot.
[161:13.73]That's a lot.
[161:18.81]Okay, well that was not that bad.
[161:22.01]Maybe if he was a stronger character.
[161:23.67]Very cool.
[161:40.19]Yeah, I mean, we might have to come up with, like, a command for, like, the frames or something.
[161:45.31]Like, exclamation point frames.
[161:48.77]And just have, like, have, like, a corporate response.
[161:50.61]Like, I don't understand what's going on.
[161:52.15]My internet is fine.
[161:52.97]I think we've narrowed it down to possibly it's something going on on Twitch's end.
[161:57.12]Bear with us.
[162:09.75]Alright, well that leads to this, which this looks like the real encounter coming up here.
[162:16.01]This is a huge bridge.
[162:17.02]There's no way that this is not the real fight.
[162:21.96]I have 10,000 souls.
[162:22.62]I'm kind of concerned about this.
[162:23.60]How come no one else is losing frames if it's a Twitch problem?
[162:31.32]I don't, I don't understand.
[162:32.42]I thought people, I thought it was happening to other people.
[162:40.77]I can upgrade the katana.
[162:48.42]Others are fine.
[162:49.10]They've gotten way worse.
[162:54.74]Other streams are fine.
[162:55.66]I did switch servers.
[162:59.70]It's brutal right now.
[163:00.79]What the fuck is going on?
[163:06.47]I actually am dropping an insane amount of frames, though.
[163:10.01]Like, it's actually really bad.
[163:11.15]This server might actually be worse.
[163:18.73]It doesn't make any sense because I have... I literally have a thousand megabit upload right now.
[163:23.90]Like, I just did a speed test.
[163:25.04]It was like 940 megabits up.
[163:25.82]I don't get it.
[163:39.93]Should I change back to the other server?
[163:48.37]It is definitely happening to other people.
[163:54.14]It is literally happening to other people.
[163:55.40]Don't listen to everybody.
[164:09.13]Worse than yesterday, though.
[164:18.86]It's not happening to every streamer, but it's happening to a lot of people.
[164:23.64]This is really not good, though.
[164:25.36]I kind of might go to the other server.
[164:29.95]Yeah, let me try that.
[164:31.19]I changed it.
[164:32.37]Maybe it's happening to, like, where, like, maybe some route is fucked up.
[164:35.99]So people may be in, like, the, I don't know, in, like, the western part of the country or something.
[164:41.37]But let, yeah, this is bad.
[164:43.30]Like, I have 6% drop frames.
[164:47.62]Let me go back to the server I was on before.
[164:54.54]See if it makes it even a little bit better.
[164:57.96]Because I have 6.6% of all frames have been dropped, which that's really not... That's awful.
[165:04.87]Let me refresh the stream.
[165:06.01]I'll be right back.
[165:06.45]See if it gets any better if I go to the place I was before.
[165:13.70]I'll be right back.
[165:14.72]Don't go anywhere.
[165:16.06]Don't move a muscle.
[165:18.14]Be right back.
[166:44.14]Okay.
[166:53.55]Whoa!
[166:54.17]Holy shit.
[166:56.99]I can't even connect to this server.
[167:01.29]What the fuck?
[167:05.32]Yeah, like, I'm dropping 60% of all my frames trying to connect to this one.
[167:11.29]What the fuck is going on right now?
[167:13.55]This is insane.
[167:22.52]What?
[167:22.92]I'm going to have to connect to a... I'm going to have to go somewhere else for, like, my server.
[167:28.08]What the fuck?
[167:31.76]This is... By the way, this is the server that I use.
[167:35.20]I've been using for, like, two straight years.
[167:39.26]Holy shit.
[167:40.06]This is unbelievably bad.
[167:41.29]I don't know what's going on, but this is really, really weird.
[167:47.85]I'm doing a speed test right now.
[167:49.29]And... Yeah, dude.
[167:53.91]900 down, 900 up.
[167:55.81]Fuck.
[168:10.79]Yeah, this is fucked up.
[168:12.33]Yeah, I just did a speed test.
[168:16.77]900, 900.
[168:22.27]Well, we're going to try a different server.
[168:24.43]There's no way I can connect to this one.
[168:40.31]I will see you guys again in a moment.
[168:46.00]Yeah, I have officially confirmed this has nothing to do with my internet.
[168:50.18]Zero.
[168:53.60]I just ran three or four speed tests in a row.
[168:55.82]It's perfect.
[168:57.65]Officially confirmed it has nothing to do with my internet.
[168:59.57]I'll be right back.
[169:00.27]I'm going to try another one.
[169:01.79]It's not my VPN.
[169:02.83]My VPN's not on.
[169:05.89]Be right back.
[169:07.57]We're going to try another server.
[170:13.60]How we doing?
[170:18.98]Are we good?
[170:19.40]No.
[170:23.33]Something's still wrong.
[170:25.57]It's better, but it's still really bad.
[170:29.25]I'm going to stick on this one for a little bit.
[170:37.07]For a minute or two.
[170:40.51]This is the third server I've tried.
[170:41.97]I'm going to stay here for a minute.
[170:45.50]Let's just chill out for a moment.
[171:07.70]I have a live monitor over here and I can see that it's still about 10%.
[171:16.98]Maybe I should turn the VPN on.
[171:19.04]Because that'll route traffic in a different way, maybe?
[171:21.92]Because it's something to do with the connection to Twitch.
[171:25.96]Maybe it's a good idea just to turn the VPN on.
[171:28.04]And have it just kind of go somewhere else and have the traffic come in a circle.
[171:41.73]Seems better.
[171:44.73]We'll give it a moment.
[171:48.07]Oh, hello, Arto.
[171:50.07]What can I do for you?
[171:52.59]Alright, I'm gonna... I'm not gonna go BRB.
[171:54.81]Actually, I'm technically gonna go BRB because I think he needs something.
[171:59.01]I'm gonna sit here and just see because I think it's alright.
[172:04.80]It's definitely better than it was before.
[172:06.02]At least it seems that way.
[172:07.88]Arto, what are you doing?
[172:11.86]Where are you going?
[172:14.40]What are you doing, Arto?
[172:17.92]Yeah, I think he's probably just... I think he wants a treat or something.
[172:21.02]I would just give him a treat.
[172:23.40]You want a treat?
[172:26.34]Yeah, he always wants a treat.
[172:27.68]He wants a biscuit!
[172:30.40]Um... I'm just gonna go for it.
[172:37.43]Oh, the treat stream.
[172:38.23]That's right.
[172:39.89]Me and Holly were actually talking about it.
[172:41.35]We were like, how are we gonna do the treat tier list?
[172:45.21]How are we gonna do a treat tier list, Otto?
[172:48.80]Yeah, it's better than it was before, and we're going to have to deal with it.
[172:50.76]Because I can't just sit here and do nothing for another 40 minutes.
[172:58.61]So, sorry about that.
[173:04.89]Treat stream, yeah.
[173:06.46]We actually did talk about it.
[173:10.52]But, sorry everybody.
[173:13.48]I know this is kind of annoying, but it's annoying for me too, trust me.
[173:18.89]But it seems to be settling down.
[173:20.49]Dude, I don't know what's going on with the West Coast servers.
[173:24.03]Maybe the... Josh, you were saying the East Coast servers are doing it too, but... I connected to the server that I've been connecting to for years, and I couldn't even put anything through.
[173:37.93]But, it's okay.
[173:38.69]It's all good.
[173:39.93]I'm just glad it's not my problem, because you guys know I have, like, traumatic experiences with my internet being terrible, but thankfully, I can confirm that it's not my internet.
[174:04.36]But we continue.
[174:06.44]It's a long bridge.
[174:09.40]Oh.
[174:09.86]Ooh.
[174:10.14]Okay.
[174:10.26]Can we see Otto?
[174:13.44]Um.
[174:15.02]He just ran away.
[174:16.74]Ollie gave him a treat and now he doesn't care about me.
[174:19.96]He's like hanging out with her.
[174:23.23]He's incredibly food motivated.
[174:26.19]Wait.
[174:26.33]Go to the end of the bridge.
[174:34.73]Maybe a little bit later.
[174:35.49]A little bit later I'll show him.
[174:44.77]I will show Otto.
[174:46.51]I actually, he did lose one pound.
[174:50.26]That's good.
[174:56.24]I wonder if I can get down there.
[174:59.02]Like, right there.
[175:02.06]He was way too chunky.
[175:04.64]Way, like, bad.
[175:08.40]He's supposed to be, like, between, like, 22 and, like, 26 pounds.
[175:17.66]He, uh, he may have been, uh, closer to 30.
[175:24.74]So, I'm glad that he's, uh, getting back down to, like, 27.
[175:27.37]We wanna, I'm trying to get him to 26.
[175:31.65]Because he's a dachshund mix, so he's not... He's actually supposed to be a little bit... He's supposed to be bigger.
[175:36.29]So, his ideal weight is like 24 to 26.
[175:38.55]So, he was like 28.
[175:43.38]He's down now to like 27.
[175:44.72]Trying to get him down to 20.
[175:47.30]Alright, you get it.
[175:57.04]Let's go.
[176:09.24]Fuck you.
[176:11.27]Well, these guys got a lot of health, huh?
[176:16.71]Mushrooms, get the mushrooms.
[176:26.67]Ooh, you don't like that.
[176:33.20]Jawbone axe?
[176:35.14]Pretty cool.
[176:38.48]These guys really don't like that move.
[176:46.64]Oh, if you're getting stream syncing problems because of the weird server issues.
[176:52.60]Refreshing apparently works.
[177:00.93]Lord of Blood, your eminence.
[177:03.11]I beg you, grant me a seat at the table of the dynasty.
[177:06.77]Long live the Mohgwyn Dynasty.
[177:10.96]Long live the Mohgwyn Dynasty.
[177:12.81]Did I kill these things?
[177:16.82]No.
[177:32.57]There's been a split-second delay for months.
[177:34.99]I think I went over this before, that, like, the way that my webcam is picking up my voice, like, my voice comes out sometimes.
[177:43.60]My voice doesn't match my mouth movements a lot of times.
[177:46.82]That's normal.
[177:51.62]I actually talk really weird.
[178:07.36]alright so where am I going from here probably explore this top part I get on the horse too we're singing again
[178:54.73]Am I gonna get attacked by like the goats?
[179:00.80]Is it a goat call?
[179:26.76]R for interrupting.
[179:27.66]Got you.
[179:43.15]That was such a weird death.
[179:48.90]Face forward.
[179:49.56]That was actually kind of like terrifying.
[179:57.89]Alright, another one of these.
[179:59.53]Okay, I gotta go light the fires again.
[180:01.82]Really?
[180:02.20]I gotta do this on top too?
[180:03.38]That move is so good against these guys.
[180:24.40]Get out of the fucking way, man.
[180:33.88]You're killing me with this bullshit.
[180:57.94]Love it!
[180:59.26]Love it!
[181:23.19]Do not let this guy kill you of the one person that's here.
[181:31.11]Jermo, you're using the OP katana.
[181:32.65]Why?
[181:33.01]You were my favorite streamer.
[181:36.47]Sorry, man.
[181:52.41]Oh, we're fighting another... ...Hullo Horn.
[181:59.35]Okay.
[182:00.92]I'm assuming this is probably an upgraded version.
[182:11.68]You- I can't believe you're doing this.
[182:13.16]You were my favorite streamer.
[182:14.88]Oh, come on!
[182:20.50]It's an INT katana.
[182:22.40]It's INT and DEX huge scaling.
[182:25.76]Of course I'm going to do it.
[182:26.74]Alright, I need to light six of these.
[182:35.18]That's going to be a pain in the ass.
[182:36.70]So, I might not do that right now.
[182:39.24]But maybe I will.
[182:39.94]Depends on how far I need to go.
[182:47.03]There's that one there.
[182:47.83]There's one here.
[182:55.91]Find the Incestral Woods, Grace.
[182:58.31]And then jump from- Alright, well, that's a lot.
[182:59.95]Hold on.
[183:00.23]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[183:14.17]I could get so easily killed here.
[183:15.43]It'd be very easy for me to get killed.
[183:20.27]There's a lot of people here.
[183:22.57]I could get killed so hard.
[183:34.36]Look at all these animals!
[183:57.45]There's a couple of these.
[183:58.39]Are these like old gods or something?
[184:20.96]Ooh, shining horned headband.
[184:23.82]Whoa.
[184:31.73]Strengthens ancestral infant's head.
[184:38.85]We're taking that off immediately.
[184:47.58]So this thing is on the ground.
[184:48.96]It's kind of dead.
[184:50.74]Can't do anything.
[184:52.02]I don't like that.
[184:52.56]That was gross.
[184:55.43]Alright, I got three.
[185:02.52]Where else can I go from here?
[185:05.18]Hold on.
[185:08.60]This is the grounds where I have to fight that eventually.
[185:11.22]I need three more of these, right?
[185:13.84]Yeah, three more.
[185:14.38]I'm just going to keep going this way.
[185:21.32]I'm sure I'll run into another one.
[185:29.61]Get that Graved Lavor.
[185:33.96]this way that's a big dog that looks like a rare dog so
[186:03.20]It's just the same dog that fought this guy right here.
[186:18.28]Fuck, man.
[186:19.12]Fuck.
[186:31.47]Damn.
[187:03.68]Oops!
[187:05.22]Whoa!
[187:41.89]Well, get your fucking friends out of here!
[187:55.44]Get your fucking friends away from me!
[187:57.37]Not fair!
[187:59.31]Oh, you want to play that fucking game?
[188:01.23]Fine.
[188:02.29]We'll play... I don't have any mana.
[188:06.44]That was so goddamn dumb.
[188:08.02]Like, I'm in the middle of fighting you, and I'm like, we're just going well.
[188:12.70]Get out of here.
[188:13.70]Come on.
[188:14.30]Really?
[188:39.83]Oh!
[188:43.05]Fuck you!
[188:43.81]What?
[188:44.19]I... That was unfair.
[188:51.29]That was... That was stupid.
[188:56.48]I literally refilled the flask and I'm trying to like... Click, click, click, click, click!
[189:14.10]I had him, too.
[189:15.72]I was, like, focused, but let's have, like, five wolves just be there and attack you.
[189:20.69]That's what I gotta say about that dumb shit.
[189:39.58]It's like fucking wolf patrol.
[189:41.78]Oh, like, eat my asshole.
[189:43.79]Like, fuck out of here.
[189:47.73]You're a dumbass patrol.
[189:48.97]Oh, wait, you looking for somebody?
[189:52.59]Oh, hi, guys.
[189:55.26]Oh.
[190:28.80]So many animals everywhere like I don't want to I don't see any more fucking wolves Well, I actually have to run around and clear out like the 30 wolves that are surrounding this stupid-ass area Okay, never mind
[191:10.23]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[191:12.33]Just go.
[191:13.03]Fuck this place.
[191:15.63]I already killed this guy and got the item.
[191:17.91]Like, what do I care?
[191:18.39]What are you guys doing over here?
[191:32.61]What was that?
[191:34.17]Nothing?
[191:37.23]Wait, I could have refilled that.
[191:38.39]Doesn't do enough damage.
[191:45.50]Okay.
[191:56.85]so so
[192:21.43]Okay.
[192:38.17]Thank you.
[192:55.91]Thank you.
[193:20.39]Let's go.
[193:46.62]Thank you.
[194:12.18]That's it?
[194:39.43]That's it?
[194:39.81]I don't get anything for that?
[194:41.30]There's nothing there?
[194:43.82]What?
[194:47.46]2.4k?
[194:48.60]And not a single item?
[194:51.34]I can't... Come on.
[194:53.58]You're not supposed to fight him.
[194:55.76]I know it's optional, but I mean, come on.
[195:03.86]It was easy, though.
[195:05.17]Yeah, I know he's not like a boss, but like 2.4k souls...
[195:10.46]That would be better than that.
[195:11.62]If we had 5k, I wouldn't have been that upset.
[195:13.46]Why don't we go ahead and kill your entire family?
[195:20.46]I'll leave one.
[195:21.98]Okay, don't be an idiot.
[195:25.73]Beast blood.
[195:34.05]Oh, you're coming to get revenge for your dear old dad.
[195:40.62]It's the only way to fly.
[195:43.43]Don't make it so sweet this time.
[195:47.17]I'll show you how to make it old-fashioned the old-fashioned way.
[195:50.13]Like dear old dad used to make it.
[195:53.65]I'll show you how to make it old-fashioned the old-fashioned way.
[195:58.66]Like dear old dad.
[196:09.87]It's probably only three people in this whole chat that have any idea what that is.
[196:21.66]No, you don't understand.
[196:23.12]I'm trying to... We're finally going to close the case.
[196:26.35]Smiler Grogan and his tuna factory robbery.
[196:41.67]no one's gonna get that nobody I would be surprised if one person knew what that was no that's not a Colombo oh you're close you're pretty you're kind of close but not really
[197:09.61]Oh shit!
[197:10.92]I have 26k, man.
[197:12.88]Don't fall.
[197:28.18]No, not mash.
[197:29.20]Not Gilligan's Island.
[197:32.79]It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world.
[197:34.57]Thank you.
[197:39.74]Mash.
[197:40.60]No, not mash.
[197:42.42]Ash of war enchanted shot.
[198:13.77]I'm sure I had to make it old-fashioned the old-fashioned way.
[198:15.89]Like dear old dad used to make.
[198:20.57]When I hear like, oh, let me show you how to make it old-fashioned the old-fashioned.
[198:23.27]Like dear old dad used to make.
[198:24.98]That's like, that's like that drink, that is undrinkable.
[198:27.80]It's probably like 40% alcohol.
[198:29.64]It's probably like, it's about half the drink is alcohol.
[198:38.53]Don't make it so sweet this time.
[198:39.81]Let me show you.
[198:40.21]Let me show you how dear old dad used to make it.
[198:47.33]Ooh.
[198:53.93]No, no, no, not 40% alcohol by volume.
[198:56.05]I mean, like, the drink is 50% alcohol and 50% something else, which is like... That's too much.
[199:06.82]Ugh.
[199:09.17]Alright, I need two more.
[199:10.47]Dude, you're a lightweight.
[199:19.03]Okay.
[199:20.81]Please.
[199:24.69]Yep, there it is.
[199:25.41]I can upgrade the katana.
[199:33.93]Not yet.
[199:38.41]Aw, dude.
[199:39.05]What a dope fuckin'... Aw, drunk ring!
[199:42.67]Dude, every time I, like, beat a boss... Take a shot!
[199:59.51]I'm still missing a couple more.
[200:10.50]Did I already get this one?
[200:11.38]I got that one.
[200:12.24]On the other side, maybe?
[200:14.49]I don't know.
[200:20.45]Didn't look like I could go over here.
[200:25.41]Yeah, I got that one.
[200:26.31]Maybe all the way on the other side.
[200:32.01]Pepe left.
[200:34.63]See you in an hour.
[200:38.66]Pepe left.
[201:04.69]Uh... What have I done?
[201:10.63]Can you recommend... Whatever it was.
[201:29.82]Um... Huh?
[201:38.65]Oh, I don't need that.
[201:43.64]Pepe left.
[202:09.16]This is like too... this is too simple for what this room is.
[202:12.42]This is too simple.
[202:14.70]This guy's gonna turn into like an eagle or something.
[202:20.67]This person's gonna turn into an eagle.
[202:39.88]Ancestral Infant's Head.
[202:46.11]What is that?
[202:48.97]Didn't it say something about that?
[202:51.27]I have an item that is... Wait, what is that?
[202:57.66]Uses FP to spray Spirit Vapor.
[203:08.91]The vapor becomes a temporary geyser, which deals continuous damage to everything it touches.
[203:14.65]And then the helmet that I have... Right?
[203:25.08]Strengthens Ancestral Infant's Head.
[203:35.05]Is it just one use, or how does this work?
[203:38.98]I'm just going to try it.
[203:52.42]That's actually kind of cool.
[203:55.16]It's just reusable.
[203:58.36]That's really actually pretty cool.
[204:02.53]I wonder how much more significant it is if you have the helmet on.
[204:07.32]Alright, well, I'm going to keep it on the bar.
[204:09.54]That's kind of cool.
[204:10.14]I might use it.
[204:12.46]How do I get out of here now?
[204:13.24]Do I have to just teleport?
[204:14.08]I'm not sure I can do anything about this.
[204:20.94]I think I have to just teleport.
[204:28.88]Unless I'm missing something else here.
[204:30.00]Yeah, I got to just teleport.
[204:35.31]I got to teleport out of here.
[204:38.45]Jump?
[204:42.77]What do you mean jump?
[204:45.23]Jump?
[204:45.83]What?
[204:47.79]Jump from here foot?
[204:52.31]What?
[204:52.49]I mean like... No guys, I can't.
[204:59.02]That's not gonna happen.
[205:00.46]It's not possible.
[205:15.48]How's the frames?
[205:16.54]Is it a piece of shit still?
[205:18.22]Are you okay?
[205:19.64]I haven't really been paying attention to it.
[205:21.42]How are we?
[205:29.97]Let me see how many I've dropped.
[205:32.95]It's better than it was.
[205:36.07]It's still a piece of shit though, but it's better than it was.
[205:39.09]We went from 6.8% to 3.5%, so... I don't know what the solution is, but hopefully they fix it soon.
[205:56.40]Well, I'll just stay on this server.
[206:08.95]I need to upgrade the katana.
[206:10.27]So we're gonna do that.
[206:15.03]Oh, what was that shit they were saying about the, um... Somebody was here.
[206:19.21]And, like, don't go near them.
[206:20.21]They're scary or something.
[206:21.19]Whatever it was.
[206:21.64]There's somebody here.
[206:26.94]There's somebody in the round table now.
[206:28.96]And there's terrifying...
[206:37.90]There we go.
[206:41.88]Now this is much better.
[206:42.94]150 plus 73.
[206:45.16]That's a pretty big deal.
[206:56.95]Okay, so she's like, I hear the whales.
[206:59.51]I hear the whales.
[207:01.05]Screaming, they're yelling, whatever.
[207:02.83]They're wailing.
[207:06.72]I don't.
[207:10.58]Upgrade Oleg.
[207:14.78]Oh, yep.
[207:18.69]Post glove ward?
[207:24.67]Why not?
[207:27.29]Thought I picked up a bunch of it.
[207:30.91]Didn't I just pick up a shitload of this stuff?
[207:38.55]Alright.
[207:38.81]Well, she's like, I can hear them.
[207:40.71]So if you can hear them, they're probably laying down this hallway.
[207:42.87]Oh, maybe down.
[207:48.30]Where are you hearing this from?
[207:57.67]Where are you hearing this?
[208:03.07]Are you going to do an almond milk stream?
[208:05.28]No, almond milk is not hot for me right now.
[208:07.72]It's oat milk, actually.
[208:11.06]Other way.
[208:19.55]I want to buy the stone sword key thing.
[208:24.83]Ah, down there.
[208:25.69]Okay, somebody's down here freaking out for some... Alright, okay.
[208:28.52]Alright, hold on.
[208:30.64]Offer bell bearing?
[208:33.38]Offered Ghost Form Picker's Bell Baron.
[208:35.38]So now... Ah, here we go.
[208:41.26]Ghost Glovewort II is what I need.
[208:45.52]Awesome.
[208:52.12]I think that's all I needed.
[208:52.94]Alright, what's this person's problem?
[209:07.05]Have you ever felt the curse?
[209:10.27]With your whole being, the pox upon life itself, feared and despised by all.
[209:19.14]The reviled blessing.
[209:23.72]Apparently not.
[209:24.78]You are but a lamb.
[209:27.04]As strange as a defilement.
[209:29.73]Ignorant of your own ignorance.
[209:32.35]You no longer interest me.
[209:34.75]I've been long without peace.
[209:38.01]Don't spoil my quietude.
[209:43.07]I asked you not to disturb me.
[209:44.79]What are you gonna do about it?
[209:45.97]Be thankful of the whole serenity.
[209:48.73]It is all that keeps your death and defilement at bay.
[209:53.82]What are you going to do about it?
[209:55.64]I asked you a question.
[210:02.38]You're dealing with the magician now.
[210:08.94]I can make the room brighter.
[210:10.12]What do I do?
[210:14.08]I don't think I can do this.
[210:21.40]Okay.
[210:26.05]Maybe you can just hold a lighter up to him.
[210:29.01]Yeah.
[210:29.25]What do you think about this, man?
[210:39.12]Okay.
[210:40.24]So we're good.
[210:40.88]I'm going to use that ghost grave glove on Oleg.
[210:43.66]Yeah, you just... What?
[210:57.00]Joe Deathroot.
[211:08.46]How would you like to earn the strength of beasts?
[211:12.01]If you're inclined to haunt more of Those Who Live in Death and weed their death root, then I'll introduce you to Gurranq , the beast clergyman.
[211:21.37]I have a matter of my own to attend to.
[211:23.29]Alright.
[211:23.97]And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place.
[211:27.79]What say you?
[211:30.11]Yeah.
[211:33.09]That sounds cool.
[211:34.75]Very well.
[211:36.25]Show me your map.
[211:37.33]Are you gonna actually mark my map?
[211:42.77]You do?
[211:43.83]He marks it?
[211:48.07]A rank.
[211:49.79]A red mark was made on the map.
[211:52.44]People actually put marks on the map?
[212:00.12]Really?
[212:02.00]Alright.
[212:03.88]That's pretty cool.
[212:06.16]What is it?
[212:07.50]Still milling about?
[212:08.48]The map indicates where the gateway is hidden.
[212:10.90]It will lead you to Gurranq .
[212:15.48]Thanks.
[212:17.59]Let's just go do that, I guess.
[212:20.17]It's kind of in the front of the brain right now.
[212:23.61]Wait, I need to upgrade people.
[212:26.43]Yes.
[212:27.49]Upgrade people.
[212:28.33]Upgrade people this way.
[212:34.91]At least I can do... I can probably do Oleg a few times.
[212:36.97]Yeah.
[212:37.07]I just need souls.
[212:37.77]34.
[212:37.79]That's a lot.
[212:38.11]3400.
[212:38.45]Great many runes.
[212:40.97]I think I would like that.
[212:44.47]Yeah.
[213:03.63]Damn, I can get Oleg again.
[213:05.55]4300.
[213:06.13]I know, I've been picking up on this stuff all the time and I haven't had an opportunity to use it.
[213:20.27]I can do it again.
[213:21.15]5270.
[213:22.17]I have one ghost glove ward.
[213:25.59]Plus five.
[213:31.31]Okay.
[213:32.75]Well, I'll remember that.
[213:33.95]Getting powerful now, yeah.
[213:41.63]Alright, let's... Let me go check this out.
[213:43.60]This is kind of cool.
[213:44.94]But let me remember what I was doing before.
[213:46.68]So... Burn this into memory.
[213:51.14]This... Nokron City.
[213:53.98]It was... What was I doing here?
[213:55.64]I don't remember.
[214:02.15]I was, um... What was I doing?
[214:06.03]I was progressing here.
[214:07.39]Oh, lighting the beacons.
[214:09.09]Lighting the beacons.
[214:10.77]I was lighting fire.
[214:11.74]Okay, let me put this down.
[214:12.78]I actually have to write this down.
[214:15.18]I'm going to write in all caps.
[214:17.58]Light fires in Nokron.
[214:23.78]Got it.
[214:25.58]Got it.
[214:30.29]In the meantime, I want to do this.
[214:31.67]This is interesting.
[214:42.88]You were also doing Rennie's quest.
[214:45.72]Yep.
[214:46.90]That was part of what I was doing in Nokron, though.
[214:48.54]That was part of it.
[214:54.62]Let's see what this is.
[214:58.52]Very interesting.
[215:00.99]They said there's a gate hidden over here.
[215:02.49]It really is.
[215:06.37]Wow.
[215:06.71]It really is kind of just buried in the corner here.
[215:10.59]I definitely don't think I would have found this.
[215:15.81]Check it out.
[215:25.64]Regal's Dragon Barrow.
[215:29.10]Hey!
[215:30.05]Hey, notes, notes, notes.
[215:32.75]Excuse me, I got notes here.
[215:34.13]I got notes.
[215:45.64]Uh, do you remember this?
[215:47.64]Dragon barrel far to the east has the other half of the coin.
[215:54.62]That, that medallion that I have, the second half is here.
[216:04.64]So, that's interesting.
[216:05.72]Dragon Barrow.
[216:09.62]So... Holy shit.
[216:13.22]What is that?
[216:13.72]I was scared, though.
[216:14.78]That actually scared me.
[216:15.80]That was terrifying to me.
[216:16.72]That was terrifying.
[216:20.00]Why are you writing notes like a nerd?
[216:21.57]Because I'm trying to... Good luck keeping track of anything going on.
[216:29.81]East Geo Sanctum.
[216:39.47]Okay, so this is the guy.
[216:49.40]He's like, I'm gonna send you to my friend.
[216:51.28]Hand over death root.
[217:05.42]Let me first figure out what I'm handing them.
[217:10.11]I don't even know what it is.
[217:12.45]Death root?
[217:21.57]Beast clergyman seeks and devours these.
[217:29.18]Where did I get this?
[217:36.00]I don't know where I got that from.
[217:38.04]Where is that from?
[217:38.64]Like your notes?
[217:46.00]Ghost in the boat.
[217:47.68]Oh, okay.
[217:50.16]I see.
[217:50.44]Hold on, let me... Give me one second.
[217:54.24]I want to... I want to... Air circulation here.
[218:04.15]Air circulation.
[218:06.66]Naked?
[218:07.10]No, I have shorts on.
[218:13.30]What happens if I do this?
[218:15.04]Give him one death root.
[218:16.48]Does he talk to me now?
[218:36.20]Bring more.
[218:38.50]I shall grant thee eye and claw.
[218:44.17]Feed me more.
[218:47.67]Claw mark seal.
[218:50.99]Beast eye?
[218:51.69]I shall grant thee feed.
[218:59.35]Uhh... Said to tremble when close to death root.
[219:08.54]It's said to tremble when near death root.
[219:09.98]The murky violet iris writhes if it's alive.
[219:12.97]I wonder if that puts an indicator on the screen?
[219:24.07]Fort Faroth in the Dragon Barrel.
[219:29.93]That was kind of interesting.
[219:30.73]What was the other thing you got?
[219:32.07]You gave me two things.
[219:33.39]Claw.
[219:33.69]What was it?
[219:48.26]Sometimes I kind of wish this game had a combat log of history that happened.
[219:55.51]What was it?
[219:56.11]I just got it.
[219:56.65]It gave me two things.
[220:00.75]Eye and the claw.
[220:01.79]But what is the claw?
[220:07.12]It's a weapon?
[220:16.66]What is it?
[220:19.55]It's a talisman.
[220:33.63]Faith talisman?
[220:35.75]Where is it?
[220:36.13]Can you give me two things?
[220:41.19]It's an offhand.
[220:41.99]Oh.
[220:50.31]Bestial incantations.
[220:52.07]Okay.
[220:52.51]I was looking around.
[220:53.71]I thought it was an item.
[220:56.39]That's kind of cool.
[220:57.13]So it's a... Does that thing... Does that cast spells?
[221:01.95]Very cool.
[221:02.49]Alright.
[221:02.91]That's pretty nice.
[221:10.00]Alright.
[221:10.20]Should I just get embarrassed and die from this thing?
[221:13.90]That's really cool.
[221:14.54]Alright.
[221:14.86]Let's... This area, I'm probably not supposed to be here.
[221:16.90]So let's go ahead and just spray this guy.
[221:29.45]Wait, this is a boss.
[221:30.43]What?
[221:31.97]This is a boss?
[221:35.31]That took me a while to figure that out.
[221:37.73]I was mesmerized.
[221:39.87]Okay, that's one hit.
[221:43.03]Okay.
[222:01.59]It's a weird place to fight them too.
[222:14.01]They're not hostile until you hit them.
[222:29.04]Well, now I want to go out there and fight him.
[222:31.97]How is he versus this stuff?
[222:32.97]Let's see.
[222:42.96]Very bad.
[222:46.14]What if he was like, and I blinded him?
[222:55.02]I'm going to try it one more time.
[222:56.58]It's just for fun.
[223:06.30]Whoa, that goes far.
[223:09.24]Summon Oleg.
[223:10.06]Actually, I'll summon Oleg.
[223:13.02]Get the hell out of here, man.
[223:17.75]Can he not follow me inside?
[223:22.61]That actually could be kind of funny.
[223:24.23]If I can just cheese him.
[223:26.19]No, no.
[223:26.77]I'll come back and actually fight him.
[223:27.77]I want to actually fight.
[223:28.57]Alright.
[223:29.09]Yeah.
[223:29.55]I'm level like 62 or something.
[223:32.79]I shouldn't be here.
[223:37.19]Okay.
[223:37.67]Well, that was kind of cool.
[223:38.53]Now I know what this is for.
[223:39.79]We're all the way over here.
[223:44.39]So.
[223:45.93]We are going to go back to Nokoran.
[223:51.56]Because I need to light the fires in Nokron.
[224:06.40]Still missing, I believe... Two?
[224:09.38]Two fires?
[224:23.38]That was a chewy noise.
[224:25.58]Chewy!
[224:26.58]Chewy!
[224:30.00]I always have to lean in and get off camera to do a voice, because I don't want to be like... Because I make like weird, scary, weird faces.
[224:40.30]Is this seriously... This is not the closest one, right?
[224:44.46]No, it's not.
[224:50.61]This went closer.
[224:56.12]But, I'm already doing it.
[225:00.42]Why is the stream stuttering?
[225:02.18]Exclamation point frames!
[225:14.11]Blow pop!
[225:16.91]That was so funny.
[225:32.50]Alright.
[225:33.28]Let's go.
[225:34.14]Let's go.
[225:35.02]Let's go.
[225:35.54]I definitely am an idiot.
[225:48.81]Because there's absolutely another bonfire somewhere right here.
[225:54.57]It's alright though.
[225:55.61]I need two more fires.
[225:56.65]We fight whatever that is.
[225:57.87]And then maybe I'll... Do I continue that?
[226:00.94]The Rennie quest?
[226:04.30]Alright.
[226:04.72]I went to the right.
[226:05.41]I need to go to the left.
[226:20.92]What about... Yes.
[226:24.02]Yes.
[226:24.74]Oh my god, really?
[226:32.54]Yes.
[226:33.74]Now here's an interesting thing.
[226:44.92]What's this for?
[226:48.24]Whoa.
[226:48.70]Is that person alive?
[226:54.76]Holy shit.
[226:55.55]I think that person's alive.
[227:04.14]Oh my god.
[227:22.96]Okay, I've... Night's Sacred Ground?
[227:28.12]Cool.
[227:29.31]Um, maybe I'll find a bonfire.
[227:40.47]Fogg, you found Reni's quest.
[227:42.41]Fogg, you found Reni's quest.
[227:49.54]Silver Tear.
[227:50.96]Who's that?
[228:01.64]Rune Arc.
[228:04.04]You can't... They can't get up here, so it doesn't matter.
[228:16.53]I'm just... I'm doing item search.
[228:18.31]You know that there's... But yeah, of course there is.
[228:20.99]Celestial Dew.
[228:21.77]I got a couple of those now.
[228:22.65]Ladder.
[228:25.32]Ladder.
[228:33.89]Tell a joke.
[228:37.27]Um... I'm not very good with jokes.
[228:39.33]I'm not very good with... I'm not very good with jokes.
[228:57.71]Can I go down here?
[229:01.96]I could jump to there with... The horse is not available.
[229:07.00]I'm not very good with jokes.
[229:09.16]I have to be able to... I have to prepare them and tell them.
[229:17.02]Silver tier.
[229:17.78]Alright, so this is like a... Okay.
[229:20.71]I'm ready.
[229:20.99]Let's go.
[229:21.61]Is that all you do?
[229:37.92]That all you do Okay Hopefully there's no item on that person
[230:01.82]I would be remarkably pissed off.
[230:03.02]It's a big ruin.
[230:15.46]That's another way to go over here.
[230:25.58]Mmmmmmmmm. Ugh.
[230:37.71]What are these butterflies?
[230:40.73]Oh.
[230:45.31]Frames drops only happen when you attack.
[230:48.50]I think, uh... I think that might be a really interesting coincidence.
[230:53.44]Almost didn't make it.
[231:10.98]It's your PC?
[231:11.82]It's not my PC.
[231:13.02]My PC's fine.
[231:15.95]My game is playing flawlessly.
[231:17.45]My internet is perfect.
[231:18.53]There's nothing wrong with my face.
[231:22.01]I have no pimples.
[231:22.97]I have to go up.
[231:36.40]Where are we going?
[231:41.06]Oh.
[231:42.24]Shiny in there.
[231:57.04]It's too quiet in this place.
[231:59.62]It just is.
[232:00.02]That usually means something horrible is about to happen.
[232:05.56]Black wet blade.
[232:09.07]Yep, I knew it.
[232:09.87]I heard it.
[232:10.45]Oh, it's you!
[232:26.04]What's that?
[232:26.76]How many do I have?
[232:27.36]How many keys do I have?
[232:31.18]I have... I have seven stone sword keys.
[232:37.22]I'm gonna use it.
[232:42.30]This looks like an NPC.
[232:50.14]Why can I attack this person?
[232:51.38]What's going on?
[232:51.86]Who is this?
[232:52.18]Oh, it's a chest.
[233:12.48]What is it?
[233:19.21]Whoa!
[233:20.21]This is gold!
[233:25.31]Mimic Tear Ashes.
[233:27.37]That's a gold beam!
[233:35.86]Legendary ashen remains used to summon the spirit of a Mimic Tear.
[233:40.87]Summoning consumes HP rather than FP.
[233:45.53]The spirit takes the form of the summoner to fight alongside them, but its mimicry does not extend in imitating the summoner's will.
[233:54.23]What?
[233:56.91]So I summon a copy of myself to run around?
[233:58.95]That's kind of interesting.
[234:05.36]I'm curious.
[234:06.90]This one sucks.
[234:08.70]Oleg's better.
[234:10.94]I'll try it.
[234:20.66]Oh no.
[234:27.71]How much does it cost to use?
[234:30.87]That's kind of good.
[234:31.53]It's literally the best summon by a thousand miles.
[234:36.41]How many keys did it take to get in here?
[234:38.07]Probably not that many.
[234:41.45]There's only one.
[234:41.91]Okay.
[234:42.35]We're good.
[234:45.01]Very cool.
[234:54.11]Okay.
[235:03.72]More items.
[235:06.68]I'm item collect Andy, by the way.
[235:08.85]Just in case anybody needs to know that.
[235:14.05]If it's available, I'm going to try to get it.
[235:15.51]How do I get over there?
[235:34.17]The ball is alive?
[235:35.15]Why is the ball alive?
[235:38.43]The ball has a health bar.
[235:44.48]What?
[235:47.20]Is this an enemy?
[235:50.30]Why is the ball alive?
[235:57.60]Oh shit Doesn't look like it does that much damage Don't fucking go that close
[236:14.45]Holy shit!
[236:15.33]It does a lot.
[236:16.27]A lot a lot.
[236:17.15]Like a huge a lot.
[236:23.16]Oh man!
[236:26.80]Fuck you!
[236:27.42]I gotta have a hit of wall!
[236:28.61]Get away from me!
[237:03.51]Jesus.
[237:04.85]Okay.
[237:07.49]That was a sentient ball.
[237:08.74]What did it drop?
[237:10.58]Larval tear.
[237:11.42]Okay.
[237:11.90]I got a lot of those.
[237:13.10]That's a respec thing, right?
[237:16.77]This is so weird.
[237:20.11]This is weird.
[237:26.13]That was just odd.
[237:27.45]Okay, nothing, let's go.
[237:37.01]There's so many cool enemies and stuff, and then there's just a ball.
[237:48.55]That's very FromSoftware though, right?
[237:51.41]God, it's so FromSoftware.
[237:59.20]We're slowly making our way down to the lady.
[238:01.42]Huge lady there, sitting there.
[238:03.24]Is it an old lady?
[238:12.17]This takes health, it said.
[238:13.31]I'm very curious how that works.
[238:19.04]Ow.
[238:20.70]Okay, that's a lot of health, not some health.
[238:27.67]That's so stupid.
[238:37.53]He's a fucking moron.
[238:38.85]Alright, this might be the best summon in the game if it wasn't this character.
[238:44.79]Because that's a move I don't think is worth doing.
[238:53.16]He's gonna do the spinning staff move.
[239:05.38]Oh, he sprayed the goo.
[239:12.11]He's just a mind of his own.
[239:14.33]He's trying to drink a potion.
[239:16.14]Oh fuck.
[239:17.66]Now I understand why this is so fun to watch.
[239:20.26]You like watch the streamer like lose.
[239:22.46]That's funny.
[239:24.54]Oh shit.
[239:25.08]Can I not?
[239:29.94]Okay, I can.
[239:40.09]I feel like this is an encounter that I need to pay attention to.
[239:44.29]We'll see.
[239:51.05]Now the Celestial Dew... I don't think I have to fight these things.
[240:00.40]That thing's going to get up, isn't it?
[240:06.72]Hello?
[240:16.78]Well, two versus one is not fair.
[240:20.12]What do you say if we equalize?
[240:21.64]He's back!
[240:30.10]He's fine!
[240:49.70]Alright, get up.
[240:52.04]You and me, let's move.
[240:53.04]It's 2v2 now.
[241:09.45]Back here.
[241:09.79]Help me.
[241:24.15]That bleed is sick too, by the way.
[241:27.41]That's awesome that that does that.
[241:28.81]What a great weapon.
[241:39.11]Get him.
[241:55.02]He's kind of a fucking idiot.
[241:57.58]He's kind of stupid.
[242:00.60]Like, that was dumb.
[242:01.79]That was a really dumb thing to do.
[242:10.82]The spin is so good.
[242:11.88]The spin is not good.
[242:13.56]The spin is very bad.
[242:15.28]What the fuck?
[242:28.13]Where is he?
[242:29.59]Where is he?
[242:33.09]What happened to him?
[242:40.60]Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.
[243:01.00]Give me his head.
[243:16.81]Okay.
[243:17.81]That was scary.
[243:20.53]That bleed was pretty good.
[243:24.17]Alright, so now I have an audience with whoever this is.
[243:32.51]What's the deal?
[243:33.01]What's going on here?
[243:33.83]Who is this?
[243:41.46]What weapon is this?
[243:42.18]This is the Moon Veil.
[243:50.13]Alright, I'm going to make a prediction.
[243:51.16]This character whispers.
[243:52.68]It's going to be a whisper.
[243:59.99]It's going to be a very light whisper.
[244:22.76]Well, here we go.
[244:39.15]You want anything?
[244:42.37]There's a teleporter.
[244:48.99]There is a teleporter.
[245:01.77]You didn't do anything?
[245:02.29]Alright, I just am looking, you know, you gotta make sure you walk around.
[245:09.67]In case there was something there.
[245:10.55]Okay.
[245:17.44]Does it talk?
[245:22.12]There's just a chest here.
[245:25.99]Another golden thing.
[245:27.13]Fingerslayer blade.
[245:33.11]Great Ghost Glovewort.
[245:36.79]That's a key.
[245:43.61]Hidden treasure of the Eternal City of Nokron.
[245:48.51]This blood-drenched fetish is proof of the high treason committed by the Eternal City and symbolizes its downfall.
[245:55.16]It cannot be wielded by those without a fate, but is said to be able to harm the greater will and its vassals.
[246:03.85]Let's take this to Ranni.
[246:05.97]Ah.
[246:11.29]I got a super glove warp.
[246:16.41]Okay.
[246:18.01]Well, this doesn't do anything.
[246:19.31]I mean, it's cool looking.
[246:22.54]Where does this take you?
[246:46.08]So now we're gonna go to... Wait!
[246:47.53]I'm not going there yet.
[246:48.33]I wanna light the other fires.
[246:49.43]You're welcome for the ad revenue.
[246:53.31]Thanks for the ad revenue.
[246:55.11]I wanna light the other fires.
[246:56.81]Cause I'm... There's a couple more that I have to light.
[247:01.24]And then I can fight that other boss.
[247:02.50]I want to fight it.
[247:09.93]But where are the last two flames?
[247:12.99]I don't know.
[247:19.04]How am I missing them?
[247:19.80]I'm just missing them.
[247:20.50]There's apparently two more here somewhere.
[247:23.34]That one right there?
[247:35.11]Just look, dumbass.
[247:45.42]What do you think I'm doing?
[247:51.83]Up here?
[247:52.79]I don't know.
[248:03.37]It lags every time he swings.
[248:05.81]I don't know what the fuck you guys are talking about.
[248:15.35]It lags when he swings.
[248:27.42]Yeah, it's random intervals.
[248:35.06]Okay, is it up here?
[248:36.00]I think I found one of them, maybe.
[248:38.38]Alright, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[248:39.40]There's something weird right there.
[248:41.00]I don't know what, though.
[248:46.93]What's this?
[248:47.39]It's like smoldering rocks.
[248:52.35]Oh.
[248:52.45]Okay.
[248:58.01]Okay.
[249:16.92]Ah.
[249:18.16]Okay.
[249:19.30]There's one more that I'm missing, I think.
[249:21.19]I don't have any idea where it could be.
[249:29.95]Oh, no.
[249:30.25]That's it.
[249:30.55]Is it?
[249:31.23]Oh, I got them all.
[249:31.77]Alright.
[249:32.03]Cool.
[249:32.15]Alright.
[249:32.87]Got them all.
[249:37.43]I'm going to level up first.
[249:44.59]I want to get... I need to get to... Alright, first of all.
[249:49.06]Just kill the people that are attacking me.
[249:50.36]Because summon my friend.
[249:52.84]Maybe I will.
[250:05.90]Who's still fighting me?
[250:14.45]This weapon is so good.
[250:17.67]I didn't abandon Oleg.
[250:18.69]What are you talking about?
[250:19.39]I'm sure he'll be really useful in a lot of places.
[250:21.31]Oh, stop it.
[250:45.87]Level up time.
[250:47.49]This area looks cool.
[250:48.19]This area is really cool.
[250:49.09]Okay.
[250:49.19]25,000 I think is what I need.
[251:02.23]Maybe.
[251:17.20]22, 20.
[251:17.38]What do I need?
[251:24.85]25.
[251:24.91]Alright.
[251:25.51]Gonna kill a few more people.
[251:38.12]Hey, come on.
[251:59.28]It's so good!
[252:01.12]It's so good.
[252:09.76]Is that enough?
[252:10.24]I think I need 25.
[252:13.24]I'll just kill this group here.
[252:28.13]That's such a great move.
[252:29.27]I wonder if that's only good against these guys, but whatever.
[252:31.59]I'll take it.
[252:32.01]These guys are kind of a pain in the ass.
[252:40.13]Cool.
[252:40.43]Alright, that should do it.
[252:46.23]It was 25 and some change.
[252:47.93]Hopefully it's not more than that.
[252:50.95]Works on shielded enemies too.
[252:52.19]Wow, that sounds fucking incredible.
[252:56.27]Okay.
[252:57.94]Health or more int?
[253:03.54]I'm gonna try to get health to 30.
[253:08.89]I feel like I'm really lacking in that right now.
[253:12.93]Alright.
[253:14.42]You guys ready?
[253:15.98]Ready?
[253:18.72]Let's go for it.
[253:19.24]Let's see if we can fight this thing.
[253:20.75]This is another one of those deer bosses?
[253:24.19]Or something?
[253:41.64]Okay, let's go!
[253:42.90]I wonder how different this one will be.
[253:50.63]Let's go!
[254:07.46]Regal Ancestor Spirit.
[254:09.06]Is it the same fight?
[254:15.55]One, two.
[254:18.83]Seems to be pretty similar.
[254:26.69]One, two.
[254:32.07]That's different.
[254:36.05]What?
[254:36.31]Okay, this is...
[255:00.44]Alright, so this one does three.
[255:05.53]What's that?
[255:05.99]That's four.
[255:10.55]So it's a one, two, three, four.
[255:23.06]These pigs are in the way.
[255:55.97]Don't be greedy.
[256:04.28]I love that sound.
[256:23.68]Oh, what's this move do?
[256:28.44]What the?
[256:32.78]Huh?
[256:33.74]Excuse me, what happened here?
[256:35.73]You healed to full health?
[256:39.17]Oh, well, I gotta stop that from happening.
[256:41.55]I have to starter that, I think.
[256:43.51]Holy shit, okay.
[256:44.13]Okay.
[256:52.52]That was... Okay, so that... It's not a big AoE move, it's a heal.
[257:16.95]What the fuck?!
[257:17.69]It's like bunny hopping!
[257:36.21]Is that it?
[257:52.54]Holy fuck.
[257:52.96]I thought you were going to do the bunny hop.
[258:05.96]Yeah.
[258:36.27]Oh, fuck!
[258:36.85]I think it's run.
[258:37.41]Maybe you can dodge through it.
[259:19.63]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[259:28.81]I gotta go faster.
[259:29.62]I gotta kill him faster than this.
[259:36.72]I just happen to be drinking.
[259:37.84]Alright, yeah, I gotta kill you faster than this.
[259:43.34]It's a burn fight.
[259:43.98]It's a burn.
[259:51.02]What the fuck are you doing?
[259:52.10]Stop!
[259:53.14]This shit's a burn fight.
[260:28.25]What?
[260:29.92]Or shit?
[260:31.22]And I mean that literally.
[260:47.43]Fuck, I could've done more hits on this idiot.
[261:13.55]No, no, no.
[261:18.61]God.
[261:19.11]Alright.
[261:19.61]Alright.
[261:19.91]Okay, okay, okay.
[261:20.73]Okay.
[261:21.39]Okay.
[261:22.07]So the dude heals.
[261:23.54]And I gotta kill him before he does.
[261:25.08]He healed twice.
[261:26.30]I gotta get... When he's healing, get in there and whack him a bunch of times.
[261:29.78]I thought it was a giant AOE explosion.
[261:31.28]That's why I didn't do it the first time.
[261:32.38]And he got full health.
[261:35.25]I got him.
[261:45.34]How come no sword skill?
[261:46.78]Um... I feel like I could have just beaten him without it.
[261:54.22]I'll try it, though.
[261:58.33]Make sure you use that sheath magic.
[261:59.75]I'll try it.
[262:00.05]Okay.
[262:15.22]You shit like that, like I didn't know that.
[262:17.02]Now I know that.
[262:17.86]I'm ready.
[262:18.74]Just dead.
[262:19.96]What about killing the animals?
[262:21.54]Uh, I could try it.
[262:22.08]Maybe it's the amount of heal he gets?
[262:24.92]That's a great question, actually.
[262:42.79]I should probably try it.
[262:50.34]God dammit.
[262:51.18]I got greedy.
[262:55.81]Oh my god, I'm just being stupid.
[263:23.46]Yep, that's what it is.
[263:25.04]He eats the animals.
[263:27.22]He eats the animals.
[263:28.00]Alright.
[263:29.81]I gotta run around him.
[263:31.43]Oh, come on.
[263:31.95]I could've had an opportunity.
[263:33.21]Alright.
[263:34.13]I gotta get rid of the animals.
[263:36.13]He eats the animals.
[263:40.02]That's what's going on here.
[263:42.42]Oh.
[263:43.66]Never mind.
[264:01.43]Don't panic.
[264:14.86]Oh, that's a stagger.
[264:15.94]Let's get him right in the head.
[264:16.84]See you later.
[264:24.64]Oops.
[264:27.58]Try to dodge it.
[264:31.72]That hurts me too.
[264:32.58]Alright bro, fuck you.
[265:05.57]Fuck!
[265:06.77]What?
[265:07.18]He added that.
[265:07.88]Dude, what the fuck?
[265:14.71]Stop!
[265:37.62]Yes yes yes yes yes!
[266:03.87]That's a Remembrance.
[266:08.05]Really?
[266:08.41]Okay, that's actually kind of cool.
[266:15.32]I wonder what that boss weapon is.
[266:19.86]Alright, really cool.
[266:20.62]Really, really cool.
[266:21.66]Pretty cool.
[266:24.14]Pretty cool.
[266:27.45]That's another level, too.
[266:30.35]Very nice.
[266:30.89]I want to see what that does.
[266:41.64]What happened to the Burger King head?
[266:43.16]Uh, it was kind of nerfing me.
[266:44.74]This thing is the same thing as the Burger King head.
[266:48.08]The only difference is it does not... It's way less defense.
[266:52.44]But this brings my stamina down 10%.
[266:54.12]This doesn't.
[266:57.70]It gives me the same intellect increase.
[267:04.36]But it's not as funny.
[267:05.30]Can I do this again?
[267:12.64]What's that all about?
[267:15.72]What's that all about?
[267:16.34]Okay, so let's do... Let's see what the remembrance is.
[267:35.67]I have to imagine this is probably sorcery.
[267:38.91]Right?
[267:40.23]Because...
[267:43.39]I mean, think about it.
[267:45.45]That was pretty much all sorcery.
[267:47.03]I'm imagining a pretty major spell.
[267:53.66]Hmm.
[267:56.02]Winged Greathorn Axe?
[268:00.58]What?
[268:01.37]Ancestral Spirit's Horn.
[268:03.73]Restores FP upon defeating enemies.
[268:07.97]Is this a helmet?
[268:13.16]Or is this a talisman?
[268:22.02]This is kind of a huge deal.
[268:26.23]How much FP does it bring back?
[268:27.69]Because, man, we're going to be needing that.
[268:30.41]Talisman is only about 3 FP per kill.
[268:45.98]Is that worth it?
[268:47.70]I guess maybe.
[268:48.40]Hold on.
[268:48.76]How much does it cost, too?
[268:57.47]How much FP does this thing use?
[269:01.49]Hard to tell.
[269:05.53]Is that worth using?
[269:08.18]Well, how much does a regular source remove?
[269:09.90]Does it tell you?
[269:15.41]FP costs 7.
[269:18.46]Okay, so this is 12.
[269:20.62]I get 3 back per kill.
[269:22.50]Which would mean if there's like 3 or 4 enemies... I don't know.
[269:35.59]I don't know.
[269:39.03]Worth it more just to probably level up into FP.
[269:40.93]Okay.
[269:46.50]What else are you using your talisman slots for?
[269:49.02]This one I'm not taking off for the rest of the game.
[269:52.70]This one I could replace because I'm using the magic on the weapon, not necessarily sorceries that much anymore.
[270:00.28]And this is, I could probably replace this one.
[270:10.83]I'll get it.
[270:12.27]Heal is pointless.
[270:14.83]I'll get it.
[270:15.13]Let's try it.
[270:19.17]I want it.
[270:19.47]Let's try it.
[270:20.19]I'll put it on.
[270:21.85]Okay, bingo.
[270:31.56]Restores FP upon defeating enemies.
[270:33.10]I replaced the heal.
[270:36.74]Very cool.
[270:41.40]Oh, that was awesome.
[270:43.97]Ow, what?
[270:45.76]Oh, uh, Ronnie.
[270:59.43]Do I have any, uh, crunchies?
[271:02.15]Don't.
[271:02.37]Have to be careful.
[271:13.84]I do have the Finger Blade.
[271:15.72]So I gotta bring it back to Ronnie.
[271:17.14]Let's see what else I have to do.
[271:27.47]I want to test that Talisman as well.
[271:35.96]See if it's worth it.
[271:36.50]Okay, hello.
[271:42.28]It was thee, not Blaidd, it seemeth.
[271:45.68]Even in my slumber I sensed it.
[271:47.73]I picked it up.
[271:48.47]It is in thy possession, is it not?
[271:51.87]The hidden treasure of Nokron.
[271:53.89]My thanks.
[271:55.77]Finally all the pieces are in place.
[271:59.05]Soon must I begin my journey.
[272:02.11]Upon the dark path only I may tread.
[272:04.79]Okay.
[272:08.36]Ah, but before I leave...
[272:15.56]Arian inverted statue.
[272:17.96]My thanks for thy sterling efforts.
[272:20.77]What does that do?
[272:21.61]A strange gift, perhaps.
[272:24.55]But a rare sort such as thee would welcome it, I'm sure.
[272:28.59]I am certain now.
[272:30.73]Fate steered us to our reunion.
[272:33.50]I must thank Torrent, too, for his part.
[272:36.20]You may leave now.
[272:37.58]It was but brief.
[272:40.05]But thou gavest me fine service.
[272:44.77]What is it?
[272:46.07]I too am to depart on a journey upon the dark path.
[272:51.08]Probably fight this lady.
[272:52.00]So what's that?
[272:59.94]Eberling, the hidden form of Carrion's study hall.
[273:04.40]Reveals the hidden form of the Carrion Study Hall, which connects to the Divine Tower.
[273:09.58]To unveil the secret, affix it to the pedestal of the Celestial Globe.
[273:17.13]Carrion Hall?
[273:25.82]I wonder where that is.
[273:26.94]In, like, Carrion Manor, right?
[273:28.22]Okay.
[273:33.68]I would imagine it's probably near the... The Carrion Hall.
[273:45.71]This is the Academy.
[273:47.87]This is the Carrion Hall.
[273:51.67]I would imagine... I mean, this is... Isn't this Carrion Manor?
[273:58.81]Royal... Grave... Uh...
[274:05.67]Behind Carrion Manor.
[274:08.75]On his rise.
[274:12.39]Two towers to the right.
[274:20.94]Towers.
[274:24.34]Over here?
[274:24.72]That's a... Birch.
[274:30.58]We haven't found it yet.
[274:34.69]I gotta keep going this way.
[274:38.70]Middle right of Luniero.
[274:47.20]Here.
[274:47.42]Right here?
[274:49.90]Right under Luniero.
[274:56.81]Right there.
[274:57.45]Okay.
[274:59.41]Hell yeah.
[275:00.07]This is sick.
[275:01.43]Alright, we're gonna go.
[275:01.97]We're going.
[275:02.25]We're going.
[275:15.17]All the road and just up there.
[275:28.63]I don't- I got no beef with you guys.
[275:32.21]I have no beef with you guys.
[275:33.39]Stop.
[275:38.15]I gotta go up.
[275:38.49]I'm in the wrong spot.
[275:41.47]I HAVE NO BEEF WITH YOU!
[275:42.33]LEAVE ME ALONE!
[275:42.89]THERE'S NO BEEF!
[275:46.05]Thank you!
[275:46.53]I think I have to do a different um... Bonfire.
[276:08.32]Is that a cross into that big tower area?
[276:10.54]I gotta get up there.
[276:12.86]Which... Who is even up here, please?
[276:15.58]Who?
[276:16.85]Whoa, what's this?
[276:17.33]Whoa!
[276:25.01]Oh, this is it right here!
[276:26.65]This is it!
[276:27.01]This is literally it!
[276:28.41]This is literally it!
[276:29.47]I thought, like, I had to go up here.
[276:30.85]I thought I had to go up on, like, that thing and walk across the bridge.
[276:36.36]Wow, cool.
[276:39.03]I've made it.
[276:39.53]Alright, let's keep going.
[276:56.35]Put the thing on the pedestal.
[277:10.22]Want to put it on there yet?
[277:11.20]Oops.
[277:11.78]What's that all about?
[277:41.07]Oh, I can take the statue off.
[277:42.35]Alright.
[277:42.93]I'm going to take it off because I want to explore without it.
[277:55.56]I want to go up the stairs without it.
[277:56.62]I'm just going to do it all over again.
[278:05.75]That could have been so much better if that character was going like...
[278:09.62]Put his arms out and shit.
[278:10.84]Like, that would've been awesome.
[278:19.51]Let me look before I do that.
[278:21.41]Because there could be something here that I need to do before I do that.
[278:28.75]Very possible.
[278:34.35]I need to spend my souls.
[278:36.70]Definitely.
[278:37.18]Jesus.
[278:37.60]Jesus.
[278:41.08]Oh my god.
[278:41.66]Am I going to explore this whole fucking area?
[278:43.84]And then turn the whole area upside down?
[279:04.47]Stop walking.
[279:05.21]You need to use your souls.
[279:06.39]I will.
[279:07.01]I can't.
[279:08.11]I don't have enough to level up yet.
[279:19.18]Wait, isn't that my friend?
[279:20.02]Don't I know this person?
[279:29.71]Okay.
[279:29.89]Alright, you piece of shit.
[279:44.26]What's up?
[279:45.08]What's up?
[279:45.67]What's up?
[279:46.23]What's up?
[279:47.01]What's up?
[279:57.93]What's up, huh?
[280:09.60]Get off the stairs.
[280:10.84]This is so much stupid place to fight you.
[280:12.32]Get off the fucking stairs.
[280:13.92]Get off the fucking stairs!
[280:16.95]Oh my god, get off the stairs!
[280:23.19]It's the worst place to fight in all of Dark Souls history.
[280:29.72]Get off the fucking stairs!
[280:32.60]I'm not moving until you get off the stairs.
[280:35.04]I'm not moving until you get off the stairs.
[280:36.18]I'm not moving.
[280:40.85]Keep doing that shit.
[280:41.55]Waste all your mana.
[280:42.13]I'm not doing this till you get off the stairs.
[280:47.50]What the fuck?
[280:48.10]I didn't have any blockage.
[280:59.32]You're rightfully fucking annoying, aren't you?
[281:08.26]Oh, you're rightfully annoying, aren't you?
[281:09.78]We're going to have to do a sorcery fight.
[281:16.20]You want to play that game?
[281:17.00]We can play that game.
[281:34.21]What?
[281:35.13]I don't know where you're shooting from.
[281:53.45]Oh, I see where you are, you piece of shit.
[281:57.68]I see where you are, you real piece of fucking work, aren't you?
[282:02.62]You're a real piece of work, aren't you?
[282:04.34]Oh, you've got friends.
[282:05.24]Oh, look at your friends.
[282:10.93]Come on.
[282:11.11]Okay.
[282:15.09]This is fair.
[282:17.87]Oh.
[282:19.96]Oh!
[282:21.58]I can't summon anybody?
[282:22.62]What the fuck?
[282:26.68]This seems unfair.
[282:45.04]Are you Oh run away fine
[283:07.20]Just run away.
[283:07.86]Rise!
[283:44.93]Are we all the way down?
[283:49.23]Harry and staff?
[283:55.16]Where did she go?
[283:58.60]Ooh, let's... Wait.
[284:00.20]Unfinished business out here.
[284:02.22]I have unfinished business.
[284:06.05]Where'd they go?
[284:25.71]Up?
[284:25.81]Did we actually just go up?
[284:33.72]Don't jump, please.
[284:34.94]I'm not gonna jump.
[284:36.58]I've got them pretty close.
[284:40.84]More of those, uh... ...schwings.
[284:44.00]That'll be it.
[284:45.50]Couple more schwings and I got it.
[284:48.38]In fact... ...I'm not getting one hit killed by a meteor.
[284:52.43]This is not happening.
[285:12.11]Really?
[285:12.37]No, you're going to drop a chandelier on me or something, right?
[285:14.91]I'm not just going to run forward.
[285:19.68]Yeah, it's all just a bunch of traps and shit.
[285:21.88]I'm not going to get killed from... Yeah, okay.
[285:23.84]There you are.
[285:36.27]You're a real pain in the ass.
[285:38.35]What a pain in the ass.
[285:40.29]Get over here.
[286:13.64]You were faster than me!
[286:22.53]Thank you.
[286:43.69]Eww, sneaky little shit.
[287:03.65]Where are you now?
[287:24.30]Not this time!
[287:25.84]You're not gonna get away!
[287:30.44]Magic Downpour.
[287:33.31]Ooh.
[287:35.71]That FP item is actually helping a lot.
[287:37.17]Yeah, it is.
[287:39.53]Downpour.
[287:40.35]Where is it?
[287:49.61]Magic downpour.
[287:50.43]Summon a magic mass that sprays projectiles.
[287:52.47]Okay, cool.
[287:56.49]Alright.
[287:57.57]Well.
[287:59.65]Now I can level up.
[288:01.05]Let me see.
[288:01.39]What else is it?
[288:01.94]Okay, hold on.
[288:02.32]Something up here.
[288:05.23]Yeah, I see the ladder.
[288:06.92]I see the ladder.
[288:08.52]Going for it.
[288:13.36]Fromm, come on, Fromm.
[288:14.52]What's with this weird glitch?
[288:16.66]Fromm.
[288:16.88]This is dangerous.
[288:57.33]Hold on.
[289:00.31]Hold on.
[289:01.31]Hold on.
[289:01.83]Nobody do anything weird.
[289:03.35]What?
[289:03.53]Why can they walk like this?
[289:09.18]We're good.
[289:23.54]Yeah, alright.
[289:25.08]Hold on.
[289:34.40]Oh shit, I got some mana back!
[289:36.24]That's how that works.
[289:55.21]There better be something good up here.
[289:56.29]Alright, what's the least... The path of the least resistance here?
[290:05.81]I don't know.
[290:06.37]I'm gonna get spawned on.
[290:08.17]They're gonna climb up something.
[290:09.61]I gotta be... I gotta get myself situated.
[290:11.18]That straightaway right there.
[290:39.34]What is that?
[290:48.87]Hmm.
[290:51.07]Boost FP restoration from flask.
[290:53.21]Hmm.
[290:55.91]It's really not that big of a deal.
[290:57.07]That's not worth climbing two ladders for.
[291:01.32]That's not worth climbing two ladders for.
[291:05.30]Well.
[291:07.83]Okay, that's it.
[291:09.29]Nothing else here.
[291:09.85]I'm just going to jump down to here.
[291:11.93]I'm going to go back down.
[291:13.95]I'm going to go up a little bit more, though.
[291:16.20]Okay.
[291:28.20]Be careful.
[291:28.73]Wait.
[291:28.97]Okay.
[291:36.15]I do want to go here, though, because there was another place to go.
[291:41.08]What is this?
[291:43.30]Wait.
[291:43.66]No, no, no, no, no.
[291:44.56]This is the way up.
[291:52.65]I think I missed something.
[291:55.33]I think I missed an item.
[292:23.37]Okay.
[292:28.03]I think that's it.
[292:29.37]Well, that's cool to get.
[292:31.04]I'll try it out a little bit.
[292:32.84]Flip the thing upside down, go back up here, and I guess do whatever I need to do for this rainy quest.
[292:41.38]Very nice.
[292:47.95]I haven't been here for a few hours.
[292:49.23]What's going on with that hat?
[292:51.87]I lost a bet with chat, and they said that I had to wear this hat for the next three to six hours of gameplay.
[292:59.65]It does... It's so fucking stupid.
[293:02.21]When you put this on, you take 25% more damage from all sources.
[293:07.56]It's... A lot of, like, speedrunners and, like, really, like, hardcore gamers are going to be using it because your movement speed is, like, 10% faster.
[293:15.86]But it's, like, really bad to have on right now.
[293:19.38]It's actually a pretty stupid thing to wear for like a first playthrough.
[293:25.64]It might even be 30% more damage with a 10% movement speed buff.
[293:45.20]Why does he just lie all the time?
[293:46.54]I don't know, because it's kind of funny.
[293:49.59]I'm just making conversation, but ooh, what's going on with you?
[293:52.49]Oh celestial globe, transmit to posterity the wisdom of the moon and stars and obscure forever the transgressions of the princess.
[294:14.56]I'm gonna get this to 30 and then we're gonna do some more intelligence.
[294:22.74]Let's check it out.
[294:24.26]Magic down four.
[294:27.86]I'll try it.
[294:28.96]Let's see what it does.
[294:37.19]Ooh, actually pretty good.
[294:38.77]Area denial.
[294:39.37]Can I charge it?
[294:43.17]I can charge it.
[294:43.83]Ooh.
[294:53.15]That's pretty good denial, right?
[294:54.33]Like, I can kind of catch people off guard.
[294:56.96]Does, like, no damage.
[294:58.16]Yeah, but it's probably good to... It's a very good denial.
[295:05.98]Okay, now let's go for it.
[295:07.10]I already saw this.
[295:13.62]Let me check the frames.
[295:16.68]I'm just curious.
[295:20.40]Yeah.
[295:22.40]It's a pretty consistent 3% frame drop.
[295:27.59]For some reason.
[295:31.45]On Twitch, what's going on with my connection to your servers?
[295:34.33]What's going on here?
[295:40.33]No.
[295:42.81]No.
[295:43.31]I don't want to do this area.
[295:47.79]There are hands here.
[295:48.60]I don't want to do it.
[295:53.46]No.
[295:57.08]No.
[295:57.20]No, I don't want to do it there.
[295:58.34]Hands here.
[295:58.68]I don't want to do it.
[296:02.21]This is my least favorite enemy in the game.
[296:08.31]Are you actually back?
[296:09.39]I killed you already.
[296:10.94]What?
[296:20.79]Oh, here comes the cheese whiz.
[296:25.01]Here comes the cheese whiz.
[296:31.71]What's wrong?
[296:32.53]Fuck.
[297:07.09]You guys wanted me to play Worms.
[297:10.17]Here it is.
[297:10.63]I don't have any more mana left.
[297:31.53]Move.
[297:55.60]Mask of confidence?
[297:56.68]Am I safe right here?
[298:00.00]There's a knife pointing at me.
[298:02.78]No, okay.
[298:03.54]I gotta get in there and kill.
[298:20.25]What the fuck?
[298:24.23]What are you looking at?
[298:30.64]This feels like a modded PvP area.
[298:32.98]I feel like I'm not supposed to be playing here.
[298:34.46]Don't dodge.
[299:00.25]what the fuck is happening stop getting caught on whatever bullshit you're getting caught on
[299:34.33]Get out of here with your fingers.
[299:49.18]Get your fucking hand away from me!
[299:57.65]No!
[301:30.61]Okay.
[301:44.32]Wait, what's that?
[301:44.90]What's that?
[301:45.24]What's that?
[301:45.56]I want to see what that was.
[301:46.80]What was that?
[301:50.16]I hope there's a bonfire down here because I want to go back and kill that person.
[301:53.32]What was up there?
[301:53.98]Hold on.
[301:54.46]What is this?
[301:55.39]Where am I?
[301:56.27]What was up there?
[302:04.57]What was up there?
[302:10.72]Any items?
[302:11.24]There's probably one hidden.
[302:23.23]Very confused.
[302:24.70]I need a bonfire.
[302:25.44]I don't think I want to open this.
[302:35.98]That's kind of scary.
[302:42.05]That's definitely a boss in there.
[302:45.52]Alright, go back up and I'm gonna jump off.
[302:50.42]Hey!
[302:51.66]Hey, go back up!
[302:53.86]Go back up!
[302:54.34]I can't go back up.
[303:06.80]Basket Confidence.
[303:09.01]Versus Arcane.
[303:10.59]Oh.
[303:12.46]Not good enough for me.
[303:14.32]Oh, what the hell's going on here?
[303:16.72]What is this?
[303:18.16]Oh, God damn it.
[303:18.90]It's a fucking boss door.
[303:23.64]Where is it?
[303:50.34]Well, at least I have that.
[304:36.85]It's gonna be a dragon or something that's gonna land on the bridge.
[304:44.06]8k cells is a lot, but it's not too much to lose.
[304:46.46]I know, of course it is.
[304:54.42]What is this, like, stomach?
[304:57.06]Oh!
[305:02.65]Jesus!
[305:04.03]Um...
[305:07.55]Oh.
[305:08.75]That hurt.
[306:08.15]I think I can do it.
[306:09.33]I think I can do it.
[306:10.35]I actually think I can do it, and here's why.
[306:15.83]Magic Downpour!
[306:38.29]Ah!
[307:08.27]Holy shit, that goes real far.
[307:12.15]Your moveset is fucking weird!
[307:39.47]Yikes.
[307:54.54]What?
[307:58.77]Whoa!
[308:05.19]You're on a fucking goddamn ledge.
[308:06.83]I can't even do it.
[308:07.71]Alright, that's the play here.
[308:14.82]Stop!
[308:25.97]Do the roll again.
[308:27.47]I'll stagger it.
[308:27.99]Here we go.
[308:46.12]Roll.
[308:49.01]Do the roll.
[308:49.45]Do the roll again.
[308:56.31]I asked for it and I didn't know what you were doing.
[308:59.64]And now shit's all fucked up.
[309:01.02]I was in a weird spot.
[309:23.87]Do the roll.
[309:28.78]Do the roll!
[309:37.04]Do the fucking roll!
[309:39.01]Do the roll.
[309:39.95]Now.
[309:44.73]Oh, it's not bad.
[309:45.63]It's bad.
[309:48.25]Do the roll!
[309:50.57]Please!
[309:50.97]Didn't work.
[310:04.28]Done.
[310:17.46]I think I can do it.
[310:23.78]This is hard, but I think I can do it.
[310:25.28]I think I can do it.
[310:29.96]I can do it.
[310:31.24]I think I can do it.
[310:33.55]In fact, I'm gonna show you something else here.
[310:38.01]I feel like this is gonna be really, really good.
[310:44.05]Let's try a few things here.
[310:44.95]Check this out.
[310:45.41]Ready?
[310:47.40]Watch this.
[310:47.68]Why are you doing it?
[310:50.34]I don't know.
[310:50.92]Because it's kind of fun.
[310:52.56]Maybe she'll drop something.
[310:56.87]I'm going to spray this ship.
[310:57.67]Check this out.
[311:00.23]Cause a problem.
[311:04.27]It's not a problem.
[311:11.85]How much damage does this do?
[311:13.40]Just regular.
[311:14.50]So I can fucking see.
[311:31.29]in the stomach.
[311:34.09]I staggered before and I don't know how.
[311:36.27]Gotta be right up in there, I think.
[312:03.60]Got it!
[312:12.42]Hey!
[312:31.53]Hey!
[313:19.17]Fuck you!
[313:53.80]so
[314:16.83]Alright.
[314:17.41]Strategize.
[314:18.03]Strategy.
[314:18.93]Strategy.
[314:19.43]Strategy.
[314:19.89]Strategy.
[314:20.79]Do I have any items that I can use right now?
[314:24.15]I got items, right?
[314:26.48]Gradually recover FP.
[314:27.92]Check this out.
[314:29.24]This is it.
[314:29.94]Oh my god.
[314:31.20]You still have... Wait.
[314:32.34]Ready?
[314:32.54]I'm gonna use the blue shard.
[314:35.22]Bingo.
[314:35.50]I ain't fucking moving.
[314:45.82]I'm gonna equip the Talisman.
[314:47.90]I'm gonna Loretta Bow from across the whole map.
[314:52.06]Right?
[314:54.42]They're not healing, are they?
[314:56.44]Use a Rune Arc?
[314:57.32]No, not worth it.
[315:02.06]I have... Okay, wait.
[315:08.70]Oh, shit!
[315:09.38]Oh, shit!
[315:10.18]Oh, shit!
[315:11.13]Oh, shit!
[315:17.96]That's it.
[315:44.69]Poison the poison fucked with me.
[315:47.41]I did poison build up poison build up I didn't think I was gonna get poisoned.
[315:52.97]I didn't think I was going to be poisoned I thought it said Oh edge poison build up not you will be poisoned sir, sir You're gonna get poisoned sir.
[316:02.38]You're going to be poisoned That's what it needs to say sir.
[316:07.48]You're gonna get poisoned.
[316:08.92]Don't tell me poison build up
[316:12.75]I thought it was gonna fill the bar by like 70%.
[316:20.78]Oh, fuck you!
[316:22.52]Come on!
[316:23.34]Oh, I had it!
[316:32.68]If that didn't freak me the fuck out, this guy.
[316:36.31]They're dead in that fucking two seconds.
[316:51.39]That's shit out of here
[317:20.63]Thank you.
[318:03.25]Dude, fuck that stupid lock-on!
[318:06.80]That lock-on makes you, like, go...
[318:09.31]Like, I'm dying to dodge.
[318:10.45]I want to dodge through this motherfucker.
[318:12.29]Not, like, grab their back and ride on the ride like a fucking car.
[318:16.20]I can't lock on for that.
[318:25.50]I'm not fat rolling.
[318:26.38]Stop.
[318:26.72]I'm not fat rolling.
[318:27.48]Alright, this is my last try.
[318:32.53]This is my last try.
[318:35.29]I'm gonna get a full charge, Loretta.
[318:36.83]I can't believe I didn't beat that motherfucker.
[318:38.89]Like, you all know it.
[318:40.73]Stupid- Oh, eat this, but it instant poisons you.
[318:43.43]Not poison, build up!
[318:47.08]Build up!
[318:57.99]Oh, you fucking- Oh, shut up with that nonsense.
[319:01.83]Fuck you.
[319:07.66]Okay.
[320:05.31]Yup.
[320:06.15]You're not gonna fool me with that one, are you?
[320:07.66]Again, don't lock on.
[320:08.94]Game sucks.
[320:16.85]so
[320:40.64]Okay, bye.
[321:12.41]I just got to get... I just got to go get my souls.
[321:14.15]That's it.
[321:14.77]I just got to get my souls.
[321:16.77]And then I'm... I'm going to just leave.
[321:19.37]I'm going to leave.
[321:20.49]I'm going to get my souls and leave.
[321:23.31]I'm going to get my souls and I'm going to leave.
[321:24.55]Just got to get them.
[321:27.69]They're right here.
[321:28.51]I got to get to grab them.
[321:30.55]Maybe they're like close enough to maybe just like... Maybe look at them for a second.
[321:43.63]one of those fucking moves can you hit that once what was this like weird strafe jump I kept doing so
[322:11.39]Can't even fucking see, can't even fucking see, can't even fucking see, can't even fucking see.
[322:17.74]I'm just fucking tilted.
[322:19.42]I seriously, just like, I would have... Okay, in these games, when you get to a point where you, like, were a centimeter away from victory, it's like every organ has come out of your body, because you, like, did it.
[322:32.03]You did it.
[322:33.79]But now you have to, now you gotta do it again.
[322:37.15]Run past, I'm not gonna, I refuse.
[322:44.18]It's like every organ has been taken out, like, rubbing alcohol dumped on it and put back in my body.
[322:50.32]Like, I beat them.
[322:54.58]I can ride my horse?
[322:56.16]What?
[322:57.46]I didn't know that.
[322:58.66]When have I ever been able to ride a horse like this on a bridge?
[323:05.53]Where are my souls?
[323:07.19]Where the fuck are they?
[323:07.85]Where are my souls?
[323:09.41]Why are they in this corner?
[323:12.71]Oh my god, check this out.
[323:23.15]That's awful.
[323:23.91]That doesn't do shit.
[323:24.75]That's terrible.
[323:25.89]I'd rather do downpour.
[323:31.90]In fact, like, I would rather probably just do this.
[323:36.26]Just, like, spray fucking Nickelodeon gack everywhere.
[323:39.46]Oh, you better believe that strategy.
[323:48.69]Are you kidding me?
[323:53.62]We're playing Mario Kart.
[323:55.34]It's oil.
[324:10.21]This kind of sucks.
[324:12.45]Okay.
[324:25.92]Oh
[324:38.87]Fine!
[324:39.33]I hate ripping the fucking band-aid off and giving up.
[324:43.11]You were dead.
[324:44.89]You were dead.
[324:46.37]You were dead.
[324:46.91]Yo, you were dead.
[324:49.34]It's just the poison buildup.
[324:52.16]That fucking language.
[324:53.96]That language was so incorrect for me.
[324:57.60]That fucking language.
[325:20.80]What's that?
[325:30.66]Jeremy, you're gonna get an epic item.
[325:32.12]Come on, I'll be back.
[325:53.74]That's too poison build up.
[325:57.68]Say it po- Causes of wearer to consumable to be poisoned.
[326:15.46]Okay.
[326:32.07]Poison build-up.
[326:33.39]I know, stop saying it, because it's making me fucking angry, and I'm angry about it.
[326:36.88]And I keep seeing it, and I'm saying, yeah, it's poison build-up.
[326:44.02]First mark of death.
[326:46.54]Stargazer heirloom?
[326:50.25]What's that?
[327:00.77]Oh, what?
[327:08.82]That's plus five intelligence.
[327:17.56]Okay, I have a question.
[327:19.40]Is this considered a sorcery?
[327:23.65]Or is that just magic intelligence-based scaling?
[327:26.65]Is that considered a sorcery?
[327:35.64]It's a weapon skill, so it's not a sorcery.
[327:38.18]It just stacks with intelligence.
[327:42.99]Okay.
[327:43.95]So I... I'm going to lose the potency, but I mean... That's just going to make this weapon do so much more damage and gets me closer to the other staff.
[327:54.74]So now I scale even more.
[327:57.56]Oh my god, plus 82.
[327:58.48]Holy shit.
[327:58.94]Holy shit.
[328:01.26]Alright, so that's all that's up here.
[328:03.32]There was something else up here too.
[328:04.32]What was that?
[328:04.70]It was like a key item or something.
[328:05.76]What was it?
[328:11.82]What else is down?
[328:12.46]There's something else here.
[328:20.30]First mark carved into Lunar Princess Ranni's discarded what?
[328:23.81]That's her?
[328:35.04]What happened?
[328:39.49]What the hell happened?
[328:46.36]Also known as the half-wheel wound of the centipede.
[328:50.54]This curse mark was carved at the moment of death of the first demigod and should have taken the shape of a circle.
[328:58.22]However, two demigods perished at the same time, breaking the curse mark into two half-wheels.
[329:05.27]Ranni was the first of the demigods whose flesh perished, while the Prince of Death perished in soul alone.
[329:10.99]What the fuck does that mean?
[329:26.58]Okay.
[329:26.68]So where do I bring this?
[329:32.14]I don't know where I'm supposed to bring that.
[329:37.49]Back to... back to Ranni?
[329:47.93]I got to get the other half.
[329:49.15]Is it here?
[329:55.22]Hold on.
[329:57.00]I want to... I want to kill that person.
[330:03.55]That sorcerer person, I want them to die.
[330:15.28]This person pissed me off royally.
[330:17.20]And I've got two pissed off things happening here.
[330:32.44]Damn, 450 damage.
[330:34.18]Woo!
[330:36.80]Woo!
[330:40.82]Oh, now I can actually just cheese it.
[330:42.00]This'll be easy.
[330:43.93]I have the flasks.
[331:10.46]Hey!
[331:15.48]Hey!
[331:17.64]Up.
[331:27.26]Nice dodge.
[332:05.52]I'm not going down there quite.
[332:06.62]You see how much hell on Earth that was?
[332:13.49]Oh, come on.
[332:15.41]Now where did you go?
[332:16.07]What was that?
[332:19.99]I didn't see that.
[332:24.66]Alright, so we're... Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[332:27.30]I'm gonna go... I went that way last time.
[332:28.76]I'm gonna go this way.
[332:30.58]There's shit over there.
[332:33.47]There's some shit over here.
[332:53.78]Cool.
[332:57.06]Cool, man!
[333:03.33]But where are you?
[333:09.55]Down there?
[333:11.95]You lost your fucking mind?
[333:19.62]Have you lost your goddamn mind?
[333:20.80]Come on.
[333:27.72]Who are you shooting at?
[333:28.62]Alright, I'm out of ammo.
[333:39.45]Okay, I gotta make this jump.
[333:44.76]I can't make that jump.
[333:45.64]What?
[333:45.88]What do I do?
[333:46.18]Oh my god.
[333:47.62]Where do I go?
[333:48.02]Over here?
[334:01.24]I... Lucidity.
[334:06.35]Lucidity.
[334:09.53]Alright, I got Lucidity.
[334:10.97]I don't know what that is.
[334:15.67]I'll look at it later.
[334:25.12]Lucidity.
[334:32.78]Okay.
[334:34.44]What a couple of punks.
[334:40.78]Seriously.
[334:41.94]What assholes.
[334:58.56]So what is down here?
[334:59.88]I didn't... Dude, wait.
[335:01.30]This is just this.
[335:02.07]Say lucidity ten times fast.
[335:05.25]Lucidity, lucidity, lucidity, lucidity, lucidity, lucidity, lucidity, lucidity, lucidity, lucidity, lucidity.
[335:09.76]Lucidity.
[335:12.40]Anything else you want me to do?
[335:21.27]Okay, so I was supposed to go this way, but there was another place I could go.
[335:24.61]Remember I went down the elevator and it was like another area?
[335:26.97]I want to check that first.
[335:30.77]Alright, so I did all this, but there's another area to go to.
[335:34.26]Halfway through the elevator.
[335:35.50]What do you mean, nopers?
[335:44.52]Why are you saying nopers?
[335:51.02]Yuppers, actually.
[335:52.00]Okay, so ready?
[336:07.81]Can I jump off?
[336:10.75]I can't get off.
[336:11.81]Wait, yes I can.
[336:12.39]I can go right through here.
[336:13.65]Alright, here we go.
[336:14.65]You ready?
[336:14.93]Hey!
[336:17.35]No, I gotta go over that.
[336:19.76]Alright, where is it?
[336:29.73]Okay.
[336:50.00]I'm just going to show the thing to...
[337:16.67]Please kill the fat guy.
[337:17.79]I can't sleep until you kill the fat guy.
[337:20.45]I can't.
[337:21.03]This is too hard.
[337:22.25]I can't.
[337:25.45]Lucidity.
[337:27.59]Alleviate- Alleviates buildup of sleep and madness.
[337:32.45]Oh, good thing it alleviates the buildup.
[337:50.34]Okay, when I hear the word build up, I think of like... That's what I think of.
[338:00.57]When I think of the word build up... Building up to it.
[338:04.27]This doesn't happen instantly.
[338:05.25]You're not here.
[338:30.17]Or the other tower.
[338:36.47]What's number four?
[338:37.25]Is it going to kill me?
[338:40.95]Dude, there's a whole roof system here.
[338:45.82]Hold on.
[338:46.14]Is this going to kill me?
[338:54.18]Where are my souls even going to be?
[338:57.82]Where are they even gonna be?
[339:03.07]That's gonna be such a weird place.
[339:08.05]Where are they?
[339:08.51]Are they gonna be just up on the roof?
[339:16.00]I can't see from here.
[339:17.18]God damn it.
[339:19.86]I'm not gonna lose 16,000 souls.
[339:20.58]Trust me.
[339:28.56]That was a complex fall joke.
[339:32.81]What time is it?
[339:33.47]My phone's dead.
[339:37.89]What time is it?
[339:41.69]9.46, okay.
[339:47.46]Where did I get the inverted statue thing?
[339:49.02]I have no idea.
[339:54.40]I actually don't remember.
[339:58.23]I got it from... After I beat Redan, I went to the meteor place.
[340:05.36]The place of the meteor.
[340:13.58]I'm so fucking impatient.
[340:17.61]Like, I just want to get out of the tower.
[340:20.93]So bad.
[340:21.53]And I don't want to wait for a fucking elevator.
[340:26.28]the elevator.
[340:28.52]I just want to leave.
[340:29.82]I want to just jump out of the fucking window.
[340:35.86]I could teleport.
[340:44.76]But it's right here.
[340:47.64]I could literally just jump off and run.
[340:55.27]He's gonna smash this computer.
[341:02.59]I'm not gonna... Imagine if you just heard, like, my, like, desktop was right here, and I was like, smash, smash, smash, smash, smash, smash!
[341:11.27]No way.
[341:12.33]It's too important.
[341:14.39]Okay, I can't jump from off of here.
[341:16.51]Just teleport down to this.
[341:18.14]Just get out of here.
[341:21.98]no I would never smash my computer do you understand how how dumb that is there's like there's tons and tons of money and electronics in there it would be a disaster that would be a oh we have here another dragon maybe one day
[341:55.22]There's money in the computer.
[341:56.22]I mean, yeah, the parts are worth fucking tens of thousands of dollars.
[342:02.84]I have eight GTX RTX 3090 TIs in there.
[342:09.77]Just because I want to make sure that I can run the game at 120 FPS.
[342:11.61]Okay, so it's this tower right here.
[342:17.90]So what's in here?
[342:18.80]Is it open?
[342:19.22]This was closed before, so it's open.
[342:22.74]Was this the one that was open or was this the one that was closed?
[342:30.28]You still drop frames.
[342:31.20]That's not my problem.
[342:32.30]That's not a problem.
[342:32.90]That's not my problem.
[342:35.74]That's not my problem.
[342:37.06]That's not my issue.
[342:38.20]My internet's fine.
[342:39.90]Exclamation point frames, please.
[342:48.81]Snow Witch Hat.
[342:50.75]Oh, I got the witch outfit.
[343:03.81]No bonuses?
[343:05.07]Strengthens cold sorcery.
[343:09.81]Oh, man.
[343:10.61]I don't use that stuff.
[343:15.39]I have to keep the fucking dickhead hat on.
[343:17.65]Let me see what it looks like.
[343:19.81]Let me see the other stuff.
[343:20.53]I want to see what it looks like.
[343:28.19]Really high magic defense, though.
[343:33.23]Damn it.
[343:34.98]Harry and Knight stuff is just all around just really good.
[343:37.81]Also, the other one too, this one.
[343:41.29]Which one's better?
[343:41.81]Probably the Cuckoo's Surcoat.
[344:03.56]Uh, is this gonna get me killed?
[344:04.30]I have 16,000 souls.
[344:06.80]Is this a stupid idea?
[344:18.49]Full fit, please.
[344:21.85]Pencil River, Maine.
[344:23.15]More underground bullshit.
[344:32.16]Not that I'm saying that's not bullshit.
[344:34.04]It's really cool, but... Miniature Ranni.
[344:42.83]Miniature Ranni?
[344:50.54]Doll resembling Ranni the Witch.
[344:56.58]Unresponsive doll seems pleasantly cool.
[345:02.45]Okay.
[345:07.82]Probably something else.
[345:12.16]Let me just take a look and see if anything else is here.
[345:13.94]Doesn't look like it.
[345:25.77]Go to the grave.
[345:26.55]You need to talk to the doll.
[345:29.71]Actually, I talked to it.
[345:35.23]Incoming drown joke.
[345:37.27]No.
[345:39.13]Not with 16,000 souls.
[345:41.20]The comedy meter goes off at 16k.
[345:43.32]Okay.
[345:48.42]Sit down here.
[345:50.44]How come you got one of those Thanksgiving things on your head?
[345:57.29]Um...
[346:04.32]That like, what was it, fake laughter?
[346:08.02]I didn't want to laugh really hard on camera, so I just stopped.
[346:11.99]Talk to the, what?
[346:20.10]Oh.
[346:21.20]A dogged fellow, aren't we?
[346:23.76]Or is it merely thy habit to talk to dolls?
[346:27.19]Fine.
[346:28.61]Fine.
[346:29.83]I hadn't expected any soul to recognize me in this guise.
[346:33.57]But now the cat is out the bag.
[346:36.39]I cannot allow thee thy freedoms.
[346:39.18]Perform for me a service as recompense.
[346:43.18]Eliminate the baleful shadows which prowl these lands.
[346:47.22]These lands.
[346:47.76]The name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee.
[346:51.18]I will not brook disobedience in this matter.
[346:55.10]Do not disappoint me, Mr. Potter.
[346:58.72]Perform for me a suit.
[347:00.36]Eliminate the baleful shadows which prowl these lands.
[347:03.84]The baleful shadows.
[347:04.98]The name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee.
[347:07.64]I will not brook disobedience in... What does that mean?
[347:15.49]What the hell are you talking about?
[347:23.95]Do you mean actually these lands here?
[347:26.31]Because this is where I found the doll.
[347:34.93]What is that?
[347:35.61]Is that a dragon?
[347:48.09]It's like a giant dragonfly.
[347:55.78]What is that?
[347:56.24]Oh!
[348:17.08]Is that its head?
[348:17.94]That's it.
[348:20.62]Is that its head curved down like that or is that its ass?
[348:39.27]What is that?
[348:41.05]Oh.
[348:44.45]What the fuck?
[348:46.54]Okay, I have too many souls.
[348:48.16]That thing is really, really weird.
[348:50.66]Hold on, can I eat this?
[348:52.29]With the magic shield?
[348:52.91]I don't want to do this yet.
[349:00.84]I need to level up first.
[349:21.00]I'm going to lose all my souls.
[349:25.60]I need 20... Yeah, okay.
[349:27.74]So I can come back here though.
[349:29.72]I'm just going to go... We're going to the farm zone.
[349:34.28]And I'm going to use one of those things.
[349:37.06]Alright, check this out.
[349:40.36]I'm going to use one of those pickled things.
[349:42.72]And just run around and collect shit.
[349:46.89]One of these things.
[349:47.71]I haven't used them the entire video game.
[349:51.56]Where are they?
[349:53.73]Boost Rune Acquisition for a time.
[349:55.59]Yeah.
[349:55.85]Go.
[350:09.89]I wonder how long a time is.
[350:11.07]Seems pretty good.
[350:33.26]Not great, but I gotta find a new spot.
[350:44.13]It's okay.
[350:49.56]Maybe 25,000?
[350:49.80]Fuck off.
[351:03.01]It lasts a pretty long time.
[351:03.87]It's like a minute or two.
[351:29.72]Oh, fuck you!
[351:33.16]I'm dead.
[351:33.64]I got so lazy.
[351:43.33]Wait, wait, what the fuck am I?
[351:48.17]Whatever.
[351:48.67]Uh, they're right there, it's fine.

[352:35.49]What?
[352:35.95]Wrong potion.
[352:42.23]I didn't want to have to use my actual moves, but now you pissed me off.
[352:45.17]I'm a villain in an anime.
[352:47.61]I have to use my actual moves now.
[353:01.36]Oh, I see you have some skill.
[353:04.49]Finally.

[353:29.21]Not really.
[353:31.24]Not really.
[353:32.58]What?

[356:08.26]Can I line of sight?
[356:09.00]Let's see.

[358:18.04]But, no, no, no, no, no.
[358:19.22]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[358:23.16]How do you get up to the mantis thing?
[358:25.96]Um, in, uh, in Ranni's tower.
[358:30.76]In Ranni's tower.
[358:33.14]The one that you can't go in yet.
[358:34.72]It eventually opens up after you do Ranni's quest line.
[358:39.60]And you can go into the northern tower.
[358:41.46]There's a teleporter that brings you down here.
[358:45.85]That's right, so you do it you do a stone cold stunner on camera, uh, maybe if I maybe eventually if I do a wrestling thing I

[359:39.76]Ooh, what's that?
[359:40.30]Alright, so... Here's the question.
[360:07.41]There's a cave down here.
[360:11.09]Did I explore this?
[360:16.43]Oh, there's weird bugs down here.
[360:17.53]Are those ants or something?
[360:24.06]Oh, God, they're spiders.
[360:25.26]Oh, great.
[360:27.50]What the f- What- I- My- I just got the chills.
[360:30.63]Oh, they're weird ant enemies.
[360:32.05]Ah, ah.
[360:37.27]This is so odd.
[360:58.35]It's so weird.
[360:59.25]These are flying ants?
[361:12.20]Shield grease?
[361:13.62]These are wasps.
[361:16.04]There's a huge one over there.
[361:20.16]Plus ten golden rune.
[361:31.57]Times eight?
[361:33.67]Wait, what did that say?
[361:35.59]Wait a minute, what did you- What the fuck are you talking about?
[361:41.19]Times eight?
[361:44.55]times eight.
[361:46.14]What?
[361:47.14]Holy shit, that's insane.
[361:48.46]What's that gonna be?
[361:50.70]Is that gonna be like 80,000 runes?
[361:54.10]That's actually ridiculous.
[361:55.12]Okay, well, let's not lose anything. ...
[362:12.52]Oh, you got lots of health, don't you?
[362:14.00]Alright, you gotta get behind him.
[362:29.43]He's got like a shield head.
[362:33.15]Holy shit.
[362:34.19]Okay, well, whatever.
[362:35.03]Well, I'm gonna be far away.
[362:39.61]That was just like a wham, wham, wham.
[362:42.64]Okay.
[362:43.12]Alright, well, I'll just... I'll kill him with the magic.
[362:50.96]That's far away.
[362:52.06]Shit.
[362:53.50]This thing doesn't respawn, right?
[363:06.76]Oh, palace room.
[363:15.42]Weird architecture.
[363:16.18]Hold on.
[363:20.98]I'm not going to go all the way over here, but I want to pick up the item.
[363:32.36]None of the enemies here respawn.
[363:33.56]They just die.
[363:35.04]Even the ants?
[363:47.05]Okay, let's keep going.
[363:49.07]I'm very intrigued by... Yeah, everyone's respawning.
[363:52.39]Very intrigued by this area.
[364:11.66]What hit me for that much?
[364:13.52]That was almost my whole health bar.
[364:18.49]Almost 15, 16k down the drain.
[364:21.87]What was that?
[364:22.63]Okay, I gotta take this place a lot more seriously.
[364:42.04]Not fucking around.
[364:42.94]Use the magic.
[364:43.82]I'm a magic person.
[364:46.20]Use the goddamn magic.
[364:51.00]Souls are behind him, too.
[364:52.18]That's bad.
[364:52.68]Holy shit, he's moving.
[365:13.31]Ay, ay, ay.
[365:14.01]Kill him.
[365:14.45]Kill him.
[365:15.57]Alright.
[365:23.32]What were you hiding?
[365:24.08]I took starlight off.
[365:31.99]Shit.
[365:33.27]The one time where I need the goddamn thing.
[365:57.90]Oh, there's another one.
[366:12.69]So unbelievably good.
[366:14.47]It's so unbelievably strong.
[366:20.27]The question is getting down there is going to be a huge pain in the ass isn't it?
[366:54.47]Cast!
[367:05.37]Wing of Astel.
[367:13.87]Wrong way, Andy.
[367:14.81]Wrong way, Andy.
[367:15.51]I'm kind of... I'm kind of busy right now.
[367:20.65]What is that?
[367:25.79]Sword fashioned from a delicate wing.
[367:28.76]Strong attack unleashes a wave of enchanted light.
[367:30.76]Unique skill, Nebula.
[367:38.22]I'm going to look at it.
[367:42.82]Okay, it's like a scimitar.
[367:47.98]That hurt a little bit.
[367:50.44]Whoa.
[368:01.05]Look at that.
[368:01.69]It's like as cool as the katana.
[368:09.73]That's as cool as the katana.
[368:13.55]I got to take a look at that.
[368:15.27]That could be better.
[368:18.16]Heart attack doesn't cost mana either.
[368:19.90]I wonder if it scales with intelligence.
[368:23.15]Alright, let me... What do I do?
[368:27.97]I can dual weld?
[368:33.83]I gotta kill this thing right now.
[368:36.61]I can teleport back and we can go the other way.
[368:41.61]I gotta kill this thing somehow.
[368:42.99]Alright, let's go.
[368:43.55]3, 2, 1, fuck it.
[368:53.60]Got it.
[368:58.66]Oh.
[369:24.09]Jumping R2 is so good.
[369:26.30]Especially with some weapons.
[369:28.60]They just decimate everybody.
[369:29.94]What's back here?
[369:30.80]There has to be a reason why this is here.
[369:40.11]I'm surprised.
[369:41.01]Dead end.
[369:52.96]How bad is this going to hurt falling?
[370:05.89]Even if I can go the other way, I'm looking for a... I'm looking for a bonfire.
[370:12.19]Because then I can just travel between the two, the ant bonfire.
[370:28.17]Shit.
[370:29.40]I got souls.
[370:30.32]Maybe I can buy something.
[370:35.84]Nice.
[370:36.92]Ooh, okay.
[370:40.38]Interesting.
[370:42.40]Very, very interesting.
[370:46.92]Is someone there?
[370:48.12]A customer?
[370:49.06]Well, how long has it been?
[371:02.09]Perch of Vows?
[371:05.98]Or... I mean, I have the... This is my original outfit.
[371:11.64]Crafting Repertoire?
[371:20.74]I don't know.
[371:22.96]I guess I'll get it.
[371:23.82]Get the money.
[371:29.78]Are you marking merchants on the map still?
[371:31.28]Kind of.
[371:32.10]Not really, but I might as well.
[371:33.52]Because you mentioned it.
[371:34.62]It's in my eye.
[371:44.89]Alright.
[371:45.49]Well, that was cool.
[371:46.31]I'm just going to keep checking out still.
[372:01.47]This rainy quest line is so long.
[372:09.68]This is ridiculous how long this is.
[372:10.98]I got all those runes too.
[372:15.26]Alright, I gotta find a place to go.
[372:17.34]Oh Jesus, hold on.
[372:36.34]So good.
[372:36.98]Oh, I'm so powerful.
[372:38.92]Nothing can stop me.
[372:50.81]That looks to be to me like a boss door of some kind.
[372:58.70]They're giving me a bunch of items.
[373:02.36]I feel like that's a boss door.
[373:15.35]What is all the way down here?
[373:20.19]So, I'm kind of getting... Alright, alright.
[373:21.41]I gotta be careful.
[373:21.99]I'm starting to get lost.
[373:31.65]I'm lost and I'm in a place where I don't know if I want to be.
[373:36.72]Um.
[373:37.96]Where the fuck am I?
[373:40.94]Uh.
[373:43.42]These ones are red.
[373:53.30]You're so susceptible to magic, it's not even funny.
[374:02.68]immunizing horn charm asked a Grace did I hold on let me clear this
[374:34.11]Mr. Grace.
[374:34.61]I know.
[374:34.87]I'll get out.
[374:35.24]I just want to clear this.
[374:36.32]I just want to clear this out.
[375:09.79]But I'm going to check up here.
[375:11.47]I knew they were going to be little weirdos.
[375:38.73]Oh, you're in every FromSoftware game.
[375:40.51]You do the petrify bullshit.
[375:46.03]You do the petrify bullshit.
[375:48.43]That fills up all the way.
[375:49.74]You've turned to stone.
[375:53.84]I'm just... I just want to take a look.
[375:57.42]I'm just taking a look.
[375:58.32]That's it.
[376:04.65]Get out of that.
[376:20.95]So.
[376:31.17]Dommer Smithing Stone.
[376:42.65]Okay, well, we ain't going that way.
[376:59.87]I'm going to go find a bonfire, which you guys saying back here in the river there was?
[377:05.07]I actually, I'm going to go back and upgrade the katana again.
[377:14.26]Because I can.
[377:15.98]I might take a look at the differences between the two.
[377:20.26]There it is.
[377:28.53]Okay.
[377:34.16]Good night, Bobo.
[377:35.12]What am I saying?

[378:06.60]Alright, 55k.
[378:09.28]This will be enough to level up and to upgrade a couple times.
[378:14.85]30 vigor.
[378:16.25]I'm done with vigor for a little while now.
[378:18.25]We're going back to either dex or intelligence.
[378:20.25]Maybe even some endurance.
[378:25.03]I could level up twice.
[378:38.41]Not going back yet.
[378:39.19]Never mind.
[378:51.76]I want to see what's through here.
[379:00.40]This is to go outside over here somehow, for some reason.
[379:19.24]Right out here.
[379:37.83]So many people!
[379:39.57]Stop!
[379:45.61]Oh my goodness.
[379:49.67]Just funnel into the door.
[380:21.98]Can you please beat the game soon?
[380:26.76]I'm not gonna beat the game probably for like probably another month.
[380:34.09]Now where the fuck am I?
[380:39.66]Jesus
[381:12.01]Alright, don't be a fucking idiot.
[381:49.39]Alright.
[381:58.21]Let's take a look.
[382:11.26]Sing a goodnight song for Boba.
[382:14.67]Boba, the kitty.
[382:17.47]Have a good rest.
[382:21.33]See you in the morning.
[382:25.00]Boba, such a good kitty.
[382:28.64]See you in the morning.
[382:47.23]Watch out for the waterfall.
[382:47.85]There's something in there.
[382:59.88]Nothing in here.
[382:02.27]Come on.
[382:10.27]But but how do I get up there?
[382:11.27]Okay.
[382:13.27]What is this?
[383:15.33]So many ways to go.
[383:16.21]That was really weird.
[383:17.61]Like, that was a horrible voice crack.
[383:26.97]That was Eric Cartman.
[383:40.28]You like the game?
[383:42.98]Absolutely.
[383:43.40]Yeah, I think it's great.
[383:48.46]I think it's fantastic.
[383:49.34]I think it's the best thing that FromSoftware has probably ever made.
[383:54.01]I love one of these.
[384:06.23]Oh, this is where I couldn't get to last time.
[384:18.39]Why do you hate it?
[384:20.85]I don't hate it!
[384:21.75]I gotta stop before people think that's real.
[384:28.45]What's going on now?
[384:29.98]Now what?
[384:34.12]This place is massive.
[384:52.84]Okay.
[384:55.66]Can we get an apples and bananas remix?
[385:04.83]Are you talking about like the... I want to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas.
[385:11.13]That's what you mean?
[385:11.71]I like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas.
[385:18.09]I like to eat.
[385:20.56]Well, there you go.
[385:21.70]That's the only... That's all you're gonna get.
[385:23.30]I'm not doing that anymore.
[385:33.78]What's down here?
[385:34.58]I never end... Where am I on the map?
[385:39.45]Well, what the heck?
[385:40.37]Okay.
[385:51.26]Jesus.
[385:52.36]Ugh.
[386:05.67]That bullshit man.
[386:08.90]Another Smithing Stone?
[386:17.84]What is up here?
[386:22.08]Wait, did I just come from here?
[386:25.44]No.
[386:26.68]Oh.
[386:29.58]Oh.
[386:36.16]Oh.
[386:36.30]It's the queen.
[386:45.05]If I touch the queen, they're all gonna fall.
[387:31.23]Alright.
[387:35.67]Alright, here we go.
[387:37.53]I need, uh, I need magic here.
[387:39.58]We're going with, I need something with a lot of spread.
[387:41.32]I think it's magic downpour.
[387:44.34]Just spam it, just put it, just fill the, fill the room with it.
[387:52.42]Let's go fucking just spam everybody.
[388:11.98]Oh!
[388:16.44]Holy shit!
[388:28.87]What did I get for that?
[388:29.51]A golden rune?
[388:30.09]That's it?
[388:36.15]Just one times ten?
[388:37.76]One ten golden rune?
[388:44.04]Yo, this is Plateau's Allegory of... I don't... Whatever you said.
[388:46.76]It was ten?
[388:52.22]Is it actually ten?
[388:53.26]No, it's just one.
[388:57.74]Okay, so this brings me back to here.
[388:58.90]I can get the item.
[389:02.93]That I couldn't get before.
[389:05.17]Two items I couldn't get before.
[389:06.27]I think stone.
[389:10.07]And...
[389:48.57]God damn it.
[389:54.69]I gotta go back to the... Do I actually have to kill everybody here?
[390:17.02]Diagro?
[390:17.72]Yeah, I can Diagro by killing everybody in the room.
[390:20.14]How's that for Diagro?
[390:45.26]Stop.
[390:46.28]There's too many.
[390:51.46]Nooo.
[390:57.86]I'm just running.
[390:58.60]Fuck it.
[390:59.13]Who cares?
[391:00.15]It's not that far.
[391:01.43]It is far though.
[391:02.71]Fuck.
[391:04.55]I can't believe I didn't get that.
[391:10.50]It's right here.
[391:11.14]Just run an add while you're doing this.
[391:25.83]I'm not going to run an add.
[391:33.01]If this is a rune arc, I'm going to be pissed.
[391:35.61]This better be a sorcery.
[391:37.13]That's the best sorcery in the game.
[391:44.52]Run an ad?
[391:45.30]Fine.
[391:46.00]Alright.
[391:53.65]Okay, fine.
[391:54.31]I'm gonna run two minutes of ads.
[391:56.53]No, people are gonna leave.
[391:57.65]Alright, by the time you get back, I will be... By the time the ad's over, I will be... Okay.
[392:08.61]Uh, here we go.
[392:11.17]At the Home Depot!
[392:25.08]Why did I do that?
[392:25.92]I just made a bunch of people leave.
[392:27.32]It'd be so funny if I fucking died and I was dead by the time they got back.
[392:40.16]That would be kind of funny.
[392:47.28]I wish you didn't have to.
[392:50.12]I wish you didn't have to.
[392:51.27]I wish you could sit there and let it stay on the you died screen.
[392:56.22]How goddamn funny would that be if I was on the you died screen like talking a bunch of shit to chat and everything Alright, it's down here through here.
[393:13.79]I got it.
[393:14.21]I got it.
[393:14.59]I got it.
[393:15.55]I got it.
[393:15.97]I got it.
[393:18.85]I Killed everything they're not gonna spawn
[393:24.30]Yeah, I killed the queen.
[393:27.48]I didn't run five adds.
[393:28.64]I ran one minute.
[393:31.20]What's going on?
[393:31.84]Did I go the wrong way?
[393:33.48]I went the wrong way?
[393:42.03]How?
[393:42.41]What?
[394:04.00]Where's the right fucking way?
[394:06.28]Where's the right way?
[394:11.03]Go back to the right.
[394:20.57]Yep, okay, I got it this way.
[394:31.44]Watch out for the caffeine.
[394:36.55]Jeremy, how can I avoid ads at the top of the hour?
[394:39.87]I know how.
[394:41.09]Just stay and watch.
[394:41.87]I don't run them.
[394:45.87]Ads at the top of the... What do you mean, ads at the top of the hour?
[394:53.16]Okay, don't fuck it up.
[395:00.56]Thank God.
[395:04.46]It's less you'll do.
[395:05.46]What a waste.
[395:07.84]What a waste.
[395:11.44]What a waste.
[395:19.29]Okay, so now... Where do I... I'm kind of... Now what?
[395:24.27]Now what?
[395:26.25]Now what?
[395:33.08]I don't know.
[395:34.04]Back to the other Grace?
[395:37.56]Back the other way, Your Grace?
[395:41.14]I would love to look at my map, but there's 500 fucking people aggroed, Your Grace.
[396:07.69]Bye-bye.
[396:12.62]I'm just trying to de-aggro these guys.
[396:13.82]I think I was successful.
[396:20.90]Okay, so here's the bonfire.
[396:22.72]This is the other bonfire.
[396:25.93]Now... Let me see if there's another way I can go that's not this way.
[396:32.75]There's not.
[396:33.59]Okay.
[396:34.97]So, I'm going to lead to believe.
[396:37.23]I'm led to believe.
[396:39.31]And I'm going to go back to the other bonfire.
[396:40.89]The one that was over here.
[396:45.05]Ainsel River downstream.
[396:46.15]No?
[396:47.63]Which one?
[396:48.13]I believe it was downstream.
[396:50.57]Imagine if I had a voice like this.
[396:53.93]It'd be so... The hours would melt away so much quicker.
[396:57.61]Than the way that I talk now.
[397:08.34]Am I... Chaps, am I going... Chaps, am I going the right way?
[397:11.26]I don't remember trying to find out where that is.
[397:20.29]I think if I were to go further down... I don't remember which way it was.
[397:33.82]Ainsel River Main, I think it was.
[397:41.95]You tell me where to go or I'm not going to stop doing that.
[397:50.53]You tell me where to go or I'm not going to stop.
[397:56.46]Go to the main and turn right.
[398:02.53]If that person's lying, I'm going back to British accent cringe.
[398:13.82]I was wrong.
[398:26.75]I'm led to believe that you're getting it completely incorrect.
[398:32.20]The ant places downriver, so I go here, go downriver.
[398:39.73]The right path.
[398:45.43]I'm telling you, I'm punishing that person.
[398:48.55]5,000 people are leaving.
[398:49.93]You're losing viewers.
[398:50.67]It's so funny.
[398:55.23]Losing viewers.
[398:58.09]Because I'm doing like an English accent.
[399:02.15]That's so fucking funny.
[399:09.91]Doing an English accent and people are like, I'm fucking out of here.
[399:13.37]I'm leaving, man.
[399:18.11]Okay, so I haven't been down this way.
[399:19.36]Maybe I have.
[399:28.60]I don't know.
[399:28.96]All these tunnels look exactly the same.
[399:30.25]Have I gone... Dude, I don't know.
[399:45.33]I'm just gonna go in a direction and just run.
[399:46.65]Because I actually don't fucking know.
[399:55.49]Okay.
[399:56.25]This is right.
[399:56.67]I have not been this way.
[400:01.29]Melted mushroom?
[400:11.02]Come back.
[400:11.74]Okay.
[400:12.64]If you have me in like a... Just come back.
[400:15.60]I did an English accent and 500 people left.
[400:18.72]More than that.
[400:19.06]Almost 1,000 people left.
[400:19.98]Just come back.
[400:20.80]Come back.
[400:21.32]What?
[400:21.66]What's the problem?
[400:22.68]Do we have a problem?
[400:24.11]Come back.
[400:28.57]Come back.
[400:36.89]Wait.
[400:37.37]I've already... No.
[400:38.61]This is new.
[400:44.89]This is very new.
[400:48.35]Another one of these people sitting in a chair.
[400:58.46]What?
[400:59.68]Dragonkin Soldier of Noxtella.
[401:19.05]How are you doing?
[401:20.53]Well, his whole body's like...
[401:44.04]Alright, when he does it in the middle, he does it twice.
[401:56.23]Your body is so weird, man.
[401:57.55]I can't hit it.
[402:06.43]He's missing parts of his body!
[402:18.42]Holy shit, that hurts him a lot.
[402:31.26]What the fuck?
[402:38.74]Holy smokes!
[403:17.32]The fuck out of here So strong this weapon is so good.
[403:23.68]It's unreal how good that is
[403:31.45]That shit did 400 damage every time I did it.
[403:34.49]Now, I mean... The problem with this, which I have to be careful, is it takes... It kind of takes a second.
[403:49.36]Use the Ash of War to buff its magic scaling.
[403:56.82]Here's the crazy part, right?
[403:58.27]This is the most ridiculous part about this weapon.
[404:02.13]Um, I have not been building this character full intelligence, really.
[404:08.65]I mean, I put like, I put like 10, what, 11 points in dexterity.
[404:15.43]If I had just 50 points in intelligence, this might be just stupid.
[404:27.92]You're over leveled.
[404:28.78]I don't, I'm only level 70.
[404:35.63]I'm not that high.
[404:36.41]Because people... Okay, here's the thing.
[404:39.73]People said I was under-leveled for Redan.
[404:41.95]And I was, like, 55 for Redan.
[404:46.16]This boss is an earlier game boss.
[404:47.74]Well, that makes sense, too.
[404:51.78]This area is... This area has to be after Redan, though.
[404:57.47]This is part of the Witch's Quest?
[404:59.81]Or am I just out of my mind and I just found this?
[405:08.09]Isn't the quest... This is not part of the quest.
[405:14.17]Oh, okay.
[405:15.08]So there's just a boss down here.
[405:19.36]Very cool.
[405:22.26]Well, what was the spell?
[405:26.56]I got some kind of weird, like, frost spell or something, didn't I?
[405:30.50]What was it?
[405:33.99]Can I get a new spell?
[405:38.17]Frozen Lightning Spear?
[405:40.05]Oh, it's an incantation.
[405:43.83]Okay.
[405:44.25]Well, that was cool.
[405:50.12]That was very cool.
[405:56.95]This is an area that you can get to early.
[405:58.49]This game is insane.
[406:04.46]this guy's just down here game's insane great ghost glove ward there's probably only like four of these in the game okay well that's awesome uh should I just leave
[406:34.01]so much more down here uh yeah I gotta keep doing the what's what am I even look what am I doing down here for rena's quest but what am I what am I actually doing here I don't know
[407:03.32]To go kill the shade thing she talked about.
[407:05.12]Is it down here?
[407:05.88]Let's go the other way.
[407:15.43]Cool.
[407:15.55]Alright.
[407:15.73]So... I need 29.
[407:19.51]I'll be fine.
[407:32.02]So, if I were to go... Back over here.
[407:42.04]Where was that area with all the red bugs and shit?
[407:47.49]And my throat's been kind of annoyed.
[407:50.65]Ainsel River, Maine.
[407:52.35]To Maine.
[407:55.09]And then head into that.
[407:56.07]Okay.
[407:57.27]Yeah, my throat's been on the... I'm just talking a lot.
[408:01.41]I'll probably get some water in a minute here.
[408:05.57]Okay, so... Like, over here?
[408:07.59]This is where I came from.
[408:12.33]So, from here... There was another way, wasn't there?
[408:20.56]Yeah, there was.
[408:21.20]Okay.
[408:26.08]There was another way to go.
[408:27.10]That's right.
[408:29.18]That's a whole huge area that I just... I was there for like an hour and a half.
[408:38.78]I don't... Why am I fighting these people?
[408:41.70]How long am I gonna play tonight?
[408:43.26]Um... Was it like another hour or two?
[408:47.02]Couple hours?
[408:48.36]Maybe a little bit more?
[408:51.15]I think.
[408:51.51]If I still have gas.
[408:56.73]Alright, so I went through those doors.
[408:59.98]That was where I went through.
[409:01.24]There was that big ugly guy.
[409:03.17]I did not go this way.
[409:04.39]So we'll check this out.
[409:05.97]Are you gonna go kill the fat guy before the end of the stream?
[409:13.79]Possibly.
[409:14.19]I don't know.
[409:29.10]Alright, what else is down here?
[409:30.35]Waterfall?
[409:30.83]Am I gonna die?
[409:32.25]Holy shit.
[409:36.19]It goes down.
[409:37.89]It goes down!
[409:39.47]It doesn't go down, man.
[409:40.65]No, it goes down.
[409:46.80]Okay.
[409:48.02]Still not there.
[409:48.64]It do!
[409:51.10]No, it don't.
[409:53.60]Like...
[409:55.01]My favorite part of that video is the... When he leans back like that.
[409:59.10]He goes like... He goes down.
[410:07.84]Okay, so back through here.
[410:09.69]This is just kind of taking me back to the area that I was before.
[410:16.83]I'm right at the ants.
[410:22.74]I need a better gammer chair.
[410:23.98]Holy shit, this thing sucks.
[410:37.65]This thing actually sucks.
[410:43.25]This is like concrete elbow pads.
[410:45.77]I'll go this way.
[410:51.47]Oh, I didn't go this way.
[410:55.25]You're right.
[410:57.25]Don't think I did.
[411:08.64]I got a lot of upgrades to do, too.
[411:09.92]What do you want?
[411:12.95]What do you want, ugly?
[411:23.03]I need a much better gamer chair.
[411:24.49]An actual really comfortable one that has a good support and everything.
[411:32.26]Nokstella Eternal City.
[411:36.52]Wait, have I been here?
[411:44.89]I feel like I've been here.
[411:45.93]Have I been here?
[411:46.53]No, I don't think so.
[411:51.03]Have I?
[411:51.45]No, I guess not.
[411:58.78]I haven't.
[411:59.32]Okay.
[411:59.96]Damn, there's more shit down here.
[412:14.04]I gotta pee so bad.
[412:14.92]Alright, I'll be right back.
[412:18.99]I gotta pee.
[412:21.19]This time.
[412:22.33]See you guys in like two minutes.
[414:36.80]Bye.
[417:09.66]Okay, I'm back.
[417:10.36]I don't know if I'm, like, junking up my voice, but my throat is killing me.
[417:24.77]I don't know why.
[417:26.23]There's only one side of my throat, too.
[417:29.63]Am I screaming too much?
[417:32.62]Maybe?
[417:44.82]I got some water though.
[417:45.52]I'll be alright.
[417:46.69]We'll go for like another hour or two.
[417:56.15]We'll see what happens at the end of this.
[418:05.19]Because once I get to wherever I need to go here, I'll try to complete some more of this quest line.
[418:11.68]I don't know how much longer it's going to go.
[418:15.21]It'll be a long time for all I know.
[418:17.07]I don't know.
[418:25.30]Okay.
[418:29.48]I did get some more water, though.
[418:30.68]I want to make sure it's cold.
[418:34.10]I got an ice cube in here.
[418:40.39]You're too tight.
[418:40.87]No, I'm good.
[418:41.53]I'm good.
[418:42.67]I'll be good for like another half hour at least.
[418:44.83]And then we'll be live again tomorrow.
[418:51.06]We'll do it again tomorrow.
[418:53.24]Then after tomorrow, I'm going to have to start to figure out what I want to do with this game.
[419:00.16]We'll see.
[419:00.46]I really don't know.
[419:07.05]I'm still having a bunch of fun and I'm still finding new things and finding more reasons to play.
[419:11.95]Ugh.
[419:13.19]Is that person riding a bug?
[419:27.69]Can I use my horse down here?
[419:46.42]Time tomorrow?
[419:47.04]Probably around the same time.
[419:47.84]Probably about 4 o'clock Pacific.
[419:51.50]4 p.m.
[419:52.38]Pacific.
[419:58.62]I could almost level up again.
[419:59.63]And I think I'm going to just keep putting in intelligence.
[420:02.27]Try to get to that 52.
[420:02.97]I can't use the horse here.
[420:12.35]I go up into the building or right this way.
[420:18.09]There is so much content.
[420:19.33]There really is.
[420:19.97]It's kind of overwhelming in a way.
[420:24.67]It's just so much to do.
[420:27.37]There's so much going on.
[420:28.61]Okay.
[420:46.86]Oh, that hurts.
[420:50.16]Oh, fuck.
[420:51.00]That hurts a lot.
[420:55.56]It's very overwhelming.
[420:57.21]Yeah, and every area is so different and fresh.
[420:59.95]It is.
[421:04.29]Every area just feels so... And that's why it's almost hard to remember what's going on.
[421:09.63]Because...
[421:12.07]Everything is so different.
[421:14.11]There's so much going on that it's almost like, wait, this is a whole new zone.
[421:20.59]You almost, you don't even give a shit what happened like two zones ago, even though it's important stuff going on there.
[421:27.83]It's like that ant place that I just was, there might be something else there, but it's like, whoa, look at a new pretty area.
[421:35.55]I may, I may as well have never gone there to the ant place.
[421:39.53]They just constantly are drip feeding new crazy places.
[421:45.32]It's ridiculous.
[421:47.79]In a good way, obviously.
[421:48.69]Not in a bad way, right?
[421:50.13]Like, in a very much a good way.
[422:08.90]Jerm of the runes.
[422:14.90]Jerm of the runes.
[422:15.40]I got him.
[422:24.01]What's my take on Asiago bagels?
[422:26.93]Um, they're good.
[422:28.75]Nothing wrong with them.
[422:29.77]They taste good.
[422:32.63]Alright, I'm gonna go over here.
[422:33.25]I think I have enough to level up.
[422:41.25]I will do that.
[422:42.21]Is this off cap at 40?
[422:48.53]Yep.
[422:55.96]How do I compare this to Bloodborne?
[422:57.20]I kind of can't.
[422:59.66]It's actually becoming very difficult to do that.
[423:07.25]For a few reasons.
[423:08.37]The first most important reason is Bloodborne is a PS4 exclusive game that came out.
[423:17.23]That's locked at 30 FPS.
[423:19.33]That was made in 2013 or 2014 or something, right?
[423:27.54]I mean, I consider that to be one of the best games I've ever played in my whole life.
[423:31.25]If not the best single player game I've ever played.
[423:34.57]We all know that.
[423:35.21]We're all aware of that.
[423:37.07]Problem is, this game comes out and I would say completely blows it completely out of the water.
[423:43.98]A thousand percent.
[423:46.76]Technically speaking, it runs way better, right?
[423:49.32]There's so much more to do.
[423:50.76]There's so much more going on.
[423:53.06]But... It's like... It's just... It's kind of unfair to say that.
[423:56.40]Because this game came out like... Like eight years... Seven or eight years after Bloodborne did.
[424:06.99]If Bloodborne were to have... If this was... Elden Bloodborne, right?
[424:11.57]We'd maybe... I don't know.
[424:12.49]We'd be having a different question.
[424:13.65]We'd be having a different conversation.
[424:16.59]Runs better.
[424:17.11]Yeah, Bloodborne was locked at 30 FPS and all the time it would drop.
[424:23.94]I remember that dropped down to like 25 frames a second a lot of the time.
[424:27.48]So this game runs a thousand times better.
[424:29.34]2015.
[424:30.62]Yeah, well, you know what I mean.
[424:35.76]It's been seven years since that game came out.
[424:42.89]It's a shield.
[424:49.03]How's this poison build up?
[424:50.65]Wait, you attack with it?
[424:54.69]Oh, is it alive?
[424:55.43]Damn.
[425:05.92]What's the damage mitigation on this?
[425:07.56]This thing's alive.
[425:08.70]100 physical.
[425:11.56]Guard boost.
[425:20.88]Damn.
[425:21.68]Cool.
[425:29.11]Why does everything have to be alive in this game?
[425:30.67]It's kind of creepy, isn't it?
[425:31.53]Yeah.
[425:43.65]I have already played through more areas in this game than Bloodborne x2 already.
[425:49.22]What is going on up here?
[425:53.24]I feel like I've played through Bloodborne twice already.
[425:56.08]And I'm not even like, what, halfway through the game?
[426:04.58]Why are these guys electrified?
[426:06.60]They just killed each other.
[426:11.82]Okay, well, whatever.
[426:16.15]I'll take it.
[426:23.24]Okay.
[426:26.32]Not even half.
[426:26.84]Yeah.
[426:29.30]There's no way they were not working on this game for the last, like, ten years.
[426:32.28]It's impossible.
[426:35.97]I know that they already had all these assets.
[426:38.99]After making Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne and Sekiro, they had a shitload of assets.
[426:46.71]No fucking way this game took them three to four years to make.
[426:48.82]This game probably took them, like, seven or eight years to make it.
[426:53.29]There's just too much to do.
[426:53.97]There's too much in the game.
[426:55.03]There's too many things to see.
[426:56.51]The game is too big.
[426:59.62]Are you going to do the electric explosion thing?
[427:10.79]Holy shit.
[427:11.25]Oh, they have shields on their faces.
[427:12.71]Okay.
[427:13.05]Well, let's change that then.
[427:23.91]Can I get behind them?
[427:38.26]Whoa!
[428:00.07]This game is worth $60.
[428:01.57]This game is worth probably... This game is worth probably $150.
[428:06.51]Like, this game, the actual value of the video game is probably worth like $125.
[428:09.94]Maybe even more.
[428:17.74]This is like three video games.
[428:22.68]Like, you're getting all three Lord of the Rings movies in one game.
[428:27.14]And you don't have to wait, like, three, four years between them.
[428:31.12]Like, you know what they could have done?
[428:32.88]And this is, I'm gonna, okay, time to give FromSoftware some praise here.
[428:37.42]They could have had, like, Elden Ring become, like, an episodic thing.
[428:41.84]Right?
[428:42.10]If it's like, oh yeah, Elden Ring, part one!
[428:45.80]We're seeing that a lot lately.
[428:47.14]Like, oh, it's like the first part.
[428:48.66]The more will come later.
[428:51.63]They could have done it in three parts.
[428:53.47]They could have done it in two parts.
[428:54.55]It could have been like Elden Ring Part 1 and Elden Ring Part 2.
[428:58.13]Because there's that much content to do it.
[429:03.50]Episodic.
[429:04.04]I know I say it weird.
[429:06.88]Ooh.
[429:08.14]More stuff in the shop.
[429:16.31]Whatever the DLC they do to this game is actual full-on would be like the fourth or fifth DLC in Dark Souls 3.
[429:25.74]You're getting a game that has the amount of content that would take probably five DLCs for Dark Souls 3.
[429:34.00]I don't even know what they're going to do for DLC.
[429:35.20]It's already here.
[429:39.22]It's already in the game.
[429:42.24]I'm playing it right now.
[429:45.29]Final Fantasy VII Remake.
[429:48.11]That's a good point.
[429:48.75]That's exactly kind of what I was talking about.
[429:51.51]It's just... They could have done that.
[429:54.91]They could have actually just released it like in two or three parts.
[429:57.81]I'm not saying that Final Fantasy VII is a bad game.
[430:08.12]The remake, whatever.
[430:09.02]It's just... They could have done that.
[430:23.07]Hmm?
[430:28.27]Final Fantasy VII Remake is a bad game.
[430:30.87]Well, I didn't say it.
[430:31.77]You did.
[430:37.11]Oooh.
[430:39.54]Should I do it?
[430:39.98]Should I do it?
[430:43.68]What do you think?
[430:44.08]Should I do it?
[430:45.82]I'm doing it.
[430:56.43]I thought those were statues.
[430:57.55]These are people.
[430:58.75]They're not NPCs either.
[430:59.65]That hurt.
[431:27.24]Nox Monk Greaves?
[431:33.64]Alright, so what is it?
[431:43.89]What's in the chest?
[431:48.41]Purple.
[431:51.90]Nightmaiden and Swordstress Puppets.
[431:56.60]Cool.
[431:58.92]Very cool.
[432:03.95]Fireplace?
[432:08.81]This is literally the area I was just looking at.
[432:15.67]Oh my goodness, I can jump down.
[432:17.87]Be careful.
[432:18.51]I didn't think I was going to be able to make that.
[432:23.75]Honest to God, it's kind of bizarre to think.
[432:31.95]that like what how did they make Sekiro if this was still going on I know they have two teams right who made Sekiro and who made it remember it was like Dark Souls 2 wasn't uh oh I thought it was frozen I thought I don't know who could come get me what
[433:05.45]The Dark Souls 2 team must have made Sekiro.
[433:11.60]That was so much easier.
[433:16.03]Yeah, because they had like an A team, a B team, and the B team would work on stuff while the A team was working on something else, right?
[433:22.46]I really hate to say A team and B team, but you know what I mean.
[433:24.50]Not like, oh, A, like, great, better, but like just two teams.
[433:36.59]Sakura was still directed by Miyazaki, though.
[433:40.91]Yeah.
[433:42.91]How does he have enough time to do any of this?
[433:48.22]Like, I'm just a streamer, you know what I mean?
[433:50.00]Like, I'll, like, get up in the morning.
[433:51.56]I don't know what time is it.
[433:52.94]It's like 2 o'clock.
[433:55.55]I don't know.
[433:56.31]What am I doing today?
[433:57.31]Like, I'm streaming.
[433:58.39]This guy's got, like, holy shit, man.
[434:03.57]The amount of work ethic and the amount of time and, like, genius level IQ to, like, have that much time and dedication and passion to do stuff like this.
[434:13.01]It's ridiculous.
[434:18.79]In the morning.
[434:22.57]You're still on Boston time.
[434:26.81]Oh, 2 p.m.
[434:27.59]Early bird.
[434:28.31]Yeah, the early bird special.
[434:29.65]I don't know.
[434:34.72]I'm at least happy that we get to experience.
[434:38.22]Just think about this.
[434:39.84]This might be a little sad for some of you, but don't be sad.
[434:45.70]It's literally probably one of the worst games I've ever played.
[435:00.26]I'm sad now.
[435:03.36]Only two hits.
[435:27.93]Gorsh!
[435:28.53]Gorsh!
[435:29.07]Gorsh!
[435:34.98]Okay, so what I was gonna say... Is it's gonna make people probably a little sad.
[435:43.46]This, these FromSoftware games have all come out in this kind of like, what, like 10, like, what, 15 year span?
[435:52.76]Another one of these.
[435:58.59]When did Demon's Souls come out on PS3?
[435:59.69]2009? 2009?
[436:13.51]So it's been 12, 13 years.
[436:18.26]We are experiencing, those of you that have played these games a lot, those of you that have played all of them, which I have, right?
[436:24.44]I'm sure a lot of you guys have too.
[436:29.15]The generations that are coming after us, because these games are so interesting and they're so unique and they're so uniquely made and they're so weird.
[436:39.30]In 10 to 20 plus years, people are going to be younger people, right?
[436:44.84]Like in 20 years.
[436:46.50]Younger people will be playing these as kind of this crazy, wow, can you look at all, look at how ridiculous this was.
[436:54.74]Look at how much fun this was.
[436:56.14]Imagine like this was coming out and you get to play it right when it released.
[436:59.32]That kind of shit, right?
[437:02.00]So many kids are going to be playing this in 20 years and having those kind of conversations.
[437:05.78]Like the way that we have conversations almost about like,
[437:09.98]Even stuff like Ocarina of Time, right?
[437:13.00]Or even before that.
[437:14.26]But it's not even the same, though.
[437:15.54]That's a boomer thought.
[437:18.50]Alright, I hope I don't die.
[437:25.95]That was worth it.
[437:26.37]Because we get to play these as they come out.
[437:33.74]And that's cool.
[437:36.35]But being able to like play all the FromSoftware games that at least since kind of the Demon's Souls era of them making games, it's going to be really interesting.
[437:48.71]Because they're going to play them.
[437:50.79]And what if they hate them or something?
[437:52.27]Like they're going to die.
[437:53.21]They're going to fall off a cliff or something and be like, Grandpa, I don't understand.
[437:57.57]That's right, you little fuck.
[438:03.56]Now you go back and get those souls.
[438:07.76]What if this is like they think it's dumb?
[438:15.91]Get good, grandson!
[438:22.78]Your grandson died to Pinwheel.
[438:25.16]You can sit there and laugh.
[438:26.46]Alright, I'm afraid to open this door, but let's do it.
[438:45.17]I feel like I'm missing a potential bonfire.
[438:50.57]Uh-huh.
[439:02.35]Just electrocute yourselves to death.
[439:04.11]Hurry up.
[439:09.94]How many people are in this room?
[439:15.87]How many are here?
[439:17.43]I see that globe.
[439:18.83]I see it.
[439:20.73]I see it.
[439:21.25]You're not going to fool me on this one.
[439:22.49]Here we go.
[439:32.99]Jesus, man.
[439:37.34]What the fuck?
[439:41.74]It can't move.
[439:44.16]Oh, yes, it can.
[439:48.00]20,000 souls right now.
[439:49.60]I just got 10,000 souls from this room.
[440:04.37]Oh my goodness!
[440:12.38]Is this a farm room?
[440:15.78]Seems like a farm room.
[440:24.76]My god, pick your poison.
[440:39.55]I gotta figure out what to do with those.
[440:41.53]That's the respec currency, right?
[440:49.07]Okay.
[440:55.22]You need a certain amount or something?
[441:08.07]I can upgrade the katana I think twice.
[441:09.87]Give me another bonfire or something.
[441:19.21]Or a shortcut.
[441:26.20]I thought it was somebody hiding waiting to ambush me.
[441:27.84]I didn't know it was one of those.
[441:28.84]Nice.
[441:50.18]Just let him have his dung.
[441:52.62]It's my dung.
[441:54.50]It's mine.
[442:00.31]There's no other bonfire.
[442:01.23]Do I have to actually run up here if this is a fight?
[442:09.63]Looks dangerous.
[442:26.90]Ow!
[442:27.10]Ow!
[442:27.52]Ow!
[442:30.88]Let's go, bud.
[442:52.04]Do something else!
[442:52.94]Do a different move!
[442:58.58]Did you seriously lose?
[442:59.66]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, okay.
[443:21.30]Damn.
[443:23.36]He's just over there doing party tricks.
[443:25.20]Yeah, he was just messing around.
[443:36.78]Oh, you're looking this way.
[443:37.62]Never mind.
[443:40.58]Okay.
[444:15.35]Can you parry with this katana?
[444:18.01]I don't.
[444:18.71]Can you?
[444:18.97]I don't think so.
[444:24.63]Hey, funny man, have you beaten Rodan yet?
[444:26.43]Yes, I have.
[444:30.81]This is another legendary.
[444:35.44]Moon of Noxtella.
[444:42.97]Is that the item I'm looking for?
[444:44.17]Versus memory slots.
[444:58.36]Not a big deal.
[445:02.88]It's not a big deal.
[445:04.62]It's all the way up here though.
[445:05.74]Another way I didn't go.
[445:13.19]That's the only thing that's up here.
[445:20.47]Oh, not a big deal.
[445:23.11]Not a big deal at all.
[445:27.04]Ah, this way.
[445:28.04]Right.
[445:40.41]I hear something growling.
[445:46.73]Oh, yeah.
[445:47.63]Guys, I've been streaming and doing YouTube for over 10 years.
[445:51.07]Don't you know that half my material is just calling back to other things that I've done over the last 11 years?
[445:58.17]We've reached that stage where I can just re-reference these things.
[446:02.30]That's like the whole thing now.
[446:08.38]I'm gonna get attacked by something.
[446:16.09]There's a whole other area down there.
[446:17.19]There's endless content.
[446:25.08]Hog.
[446:33.61]Where am I now?
[446:35.55]Ooh, that's good.
[446:36.85]Uh...
[446:43.55]Dude, where am I now?
[446:50.50]They made too many games.
[446:51.76]There's like four games in here.
[446:54.98]And there's like ten different systems.
[447:04.11]My nose just started bleeding after that.
[447:05.65]Oh, fuck.
[447:10.84]Okay, well, um, I would really like a bonfire.
[447:16.04]That would be amazing, actually.
[447:20.04]Is there not a bonfire over here?
[447:27.82]Uh... Shit.
[447:38.15]Is that... What's that?
[447:39.23]I'm gonna go in there.
[447:43.62]You're close.
[447:44.44]Okay.
[447:59.01]Alright.
[448:14.66]Don't fight the ants, they're scary.
[448:16.04]They actually are.
[448:17.88]Very much so.
[448:19.90]I saw how much damage they do.
[448:23.46]But did they say how much damage that I do?
[448:25.84]Quite a bit.
[448:26.28]This thing is fun.
[448:31.40]I love this thing.
[448:32.00]This thing is so ridiculous.
[448:38.40]This ring must be so old.
[448:39.68]The Elden Ring?
[448:42.10]Yeah.
[448:45.00]Probably a few thousand years old.
[448:56.35]What about the blood-borne spiders?
[448:57.51]Those are awful as well.
[448:58.31]What do you think is the scariest insect?
[449:07.19]I don't know.
[449:16.89]Scary like I am like irrationally afraid of this or scary like this thing is terrifying and can like hurt people.
[449:28.81]Yeah.
[449:30.15]It's like a probably a centipede or something.
[449:32.93]Or like a like a yellow jacket like hornet.
[449:36.14]Because hornets are just mean.
[449:37.90]They're just actually mean angry little shitheads.
[449:44.43]Really?
[450:17.99]Hey.
[450:19.75]This wasn't your fight.
[450:20.63]Those guys suck.
[450:32.01]I wouldn't make it a day in this universe.
[450:38.66]None of us would make it a day in any of these universes.
[450:40.70]We've had this conversation before.
[450:44.63]Oh, I wish I was in this universe, but, like, all this magic and shit.
[450:48.78]You want to be in a universe where... Hold on.
[451:01.98]Oh, fucking God!
[451:03.60]I'm dead!
[451:04.20]I'm dead!
[451:04.66]I'm dead!
[451:05.24]Man, that was hard hitting.
[451:12.02]How do I get back here?
[451:13.06]This is all the way up.
[451:15.81]Holy shit.
[451:24.28]Um.
[451:27.16]Oh my fucking god.
[451:28.58]This is so far away.
[451:29.76]I have to run the entire thing.
[451:40.23]Wait.
[451:42.05]Is it under here?
[451:44.07]Yeah, it is just under here.
[451:47.95]I don't want to die.
[451:48.75]I don't want to lose that many souls.
[451:49.69]I got to play really passive here.
[452:22.19]You look so menacing.
[452:23.17]I don't like it.
[452:23.65]I gotta play slow and passive.
[452:36.16]I gotta play flat.
[452:38.67]I gotta play passive.
[452:42.73]What's this?
[452:46.13]Something here.
[452:46.47]I need it.
[452:49.98]There's something right there.
[452:50.86]I need it.
[453:04.74]What about the souls?
[453:15.39]I'll be fine, don't worry.
[453:25.26]Where'd you get the fucking frying pans from?
[453:40.77]Why is he a frying pan guy now?
[453:45.85]We're good.
[453:51.52]I want what is in... There's something in here.
[453:59.29]There's nothing even in here.
[453:59.97]Did I already get all this?
[454:02.64]There's nothing here.
[454:06.14]I already got it.
[454:09.56]Oh.
[454:10.50]Oops.
[454:14.63]You gotta focus.
[454:15.19]Alright.
[454:15.37]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[454:16.13]Let's go.
[454:16.45]What's up?
[454:21.63]Are these like snails?
[454:29.42]What are these?
[454:30.74]Snails?
[454:31.61]Snakes?
[454:33.73]They're so strange.
[454:35.61]Those are weird.
[454:36.77]You need to die.
[454:37.87]You're too weird.
[454:39.15]It was going to strike at me.
[454:46.52]Did they attack?
[454:52.82]That poison buildup didn't even get me.
[454:57.15]Souls I know I know I know I know I know I'm just getting distracted.
[454:59.65]I know Shit I'm getting ganged up on Nothing here
[455:35.69]Is it an invisible wall?
[455:39.93]I don't think so.
[455:45.71]Maybe?
[455:56.38]That thing scales so ridiculously with intelligence, it's not even funny.
[456:08.27]It's just such a disgusting move.
[456:21.40]It's a disgusting move.
[456:29.40]Alright, so we're... Yeah, I gotta go up here.
[456:45.31]Then it's... Down?
[456:48.47]Yeah.
[456:50.07]Just follow the river?
[456:51.07]There's a chest in here.
[456:51.85]What was that sound?
[457:20.57]Sorcery.
[457:23.27]Sorcery!
[457:29.42]It's a regular item.
[457:32.77]Actually, I think I didn't even have one of those.
[457:37.39]Minus 33k, Andy.
[457:38.89]I'm going to be fine.
[457:40.98]Look, you didn't think I planned this?
[457:44.62]This guy is freaking out down here.
[457:47.78]And I can shoot him from up here.
[458:00.04]Okay.
[458:00.98]I'm kind of scared, actually.
[458:04.01]Let's follow the river.
[458:15.75]I'm not going to attack any of these things.
[458:19.09]You are a dickhead.
[458:21.37]It's a golden rune right there.
[458:35.78]Alright, I made it.

[459:45.87]Okay.
[459:52.78]I got everything I need to get.
[459:53.66]That was cool.
[459:56.58]Let's keep going.
[459:58.40]I wanted to go over here.
[460:01.41]Is this another place to go up?
[460:02.88]I wonder if up there I get a... Bonfire.
[460:06.64]I hope so.
[460:10.30]Let's see what this does.
[460:23.07]What's the moon veil level?
[460:23.95]Plus four.
[460:24.33]Or actually plus five, I think.
[460:29.61]Plus five.
[460:32.88]Thank god.
[460:39.69]Thank... god.
[460:50.69]I definitely have enough to do... I have some of those plus tens.
[460:58.13]Oh yeah.
[460:58.71]How many should I do?
[461:00.94]Need 30,000.
[461:01.66]30-something thousand, right?
[461:21.60]Alright, 35 int, which actually is 40-something int, right?
[461:27.50]43 intelligence.
[461:28.06]I'm getting there.
[461:31.59]Talk to the doll.
[461:34.83]Let us speak of the past a while.
[461:37.57]I was once an Imperium of the demigods.
[461:41.44]Only I, Micola, and Malenia could claim that title.
[461:45.76]Alright.
[461:46.16]Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age, which is when I received blight.
[461:59.28]In the form of a vassal tamed from Imperium.
[462:02.48]But I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers.
[462:06.01]I stole the Rune of Death.
[462:08.67]Slew my own Imperium flesh.
[462:11.85]Casting it away.
[462:13.47]I would not be controlled by that thing.
[462:16.13]She threw her body away?
[462:17.52]The Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since.
[462:20.20]She's anti-Two Fingers?
[462:21.64]Are there assassins?
[462:26.90]I'm gonna stretch.
[462:35.17]Though he was created a vassal from Eirion, he was a colossal failure on the part of the Two Fingers, Blaidd and E.T.
[462:45.02]both.
[462:46.54]Art willing to give too much to me, yet they both understand.
[462:52.94]What lieth beyond the dark path that I must betray everything and rid the world of what came before?
[463:01.75]Now, should I add thee to the
[463:04.97]Oh, whoa, whoa.
[463:05.89]No, no.
[463:07.39]I'm on your team.
[463:09.95]Okay, whatever.
[463:32.79]I think I have three.
[463:34.21]I do have three.
[463:36.71]Eight and two sounds good to me.
[463:41.17]So now what?
[463:50.88]I could go back down and keep going down the river.
[463:52.86]I could go through here.
[464:04.50]What level is... Well, I am level... 73.
[464:06.58]These guys again.
[464:24.58]Don't even do this shit get away from me I'll let that build up Oh Yeah
[464:52.27]Yeah, Sterma.
[464:53.19]Slay.
[464:55.81]Thanks.
[465:07.61]Baleful Shadow.
[465:08.95]Wait, is that- that's Blade.
[465:27.43]It's bad?
[465:27.95]Oh my god, okay.
[465:37.06]Oh my god, you have a hundred trillion HP?
[466:02.92]Ooh, that windup.
[466:24.94]Alright.
[466:30.04]Alright.
[467:05.79]Fuck you, dude.
[467:09.37]Fuck you twice!
[467:10.56]Fuck you three times!
[467:24.94]Damn, bro.
[467:27.50]Okay.
[467:29.19]Alright.
[467:33.23]He's got... Yeah, he's got a cool moveset.
[467:38.81]That's a lot of souls to lose.
[467:40.09]I don't have to fight him, do I?
[467:41.63]I could upgrade... Yeah, I could upgrade the katana.
[467:43.07]That'd make this a lot easier.
[467:46.66]Let me grab my souls.
[467:49.30]I think I can just run away.
[467:55.87]I just run and go put another point in the katana.
[468:02.24]I feel like I had the... got the hang of it there.
[468:05.76]Let me try it one more time.
[468:18.60]Oh no, that was sloppy.
[468:22.92]I always do so well in the first try and then I just get it in my head.
[468:37.52]Alright, let's go.
[468:38.04]I don't need to be a hero.
[468:40.94]I'm going to go upgrade the tunnel.
[468:42.66]I'm going to get the souls and run.
[468:54.01]I'll get him.
[468:55.89]I'll get him.
[468:56.45]He's gonna run.
[469:03.80]Bye.
[469:06.47]Goodbye.
[469:10.35]I'll come right back.
[469:20.42]You have very noticeable bags under your eyes.
[469:22.67]That's the lighting.
[469:24.01]Actually, not as bad as you think they are.
[469:33.38]Lighting.
[469:50.15]Alright, I think I can do it twice.
[469:51.11]Yeah, I can do it twice.
[469:56.95]So that would bring this.
[469:58.19]That would be a lot better.
[469:59.11]I can do it twice.
[470:03.60]Yeah.
[470:05.26]Hell yeah.
[470:07.16]Absolutely hell yeah.
[470:08.72]Now I'm going to be hurting him.
[470:11.87]I wasn't doing that much damage to him before, and now you bet your ass I'm going to be hurting him.
[470:16.50]We're at B. B scaling now.
[470:19.22]He's fucking dead.
[470:23.16]And so I don't have to keep freaking out with the souls.
[470:25.08]Let me buy... Oh!
[470:28.34]Yes.
[470:30.50]I am going to give the bell to that lady.
[470:35.70]I got another one.
[470:39.68]What's the greatest food spot on the Strip?
[470:42.05]Uh, that would be HashHouseAgoGo at the Link.
[470:50.29]They have a blue cheese hamburger, uh, blue cheese cheeseburger there and it's just... It's unbelievable how good it is.
[470:57.18]Uh, I'm gonna buy... Buy an Ark.
[471:01.08]As well.
[471:02.12]I don't want to have any souls.
[471:08.02]I'm not going to use it.
[471:09.92]Because I think that upgrading the sword a couple times is going to make this fight much easier.
[471:13.82]I'm also going to... No.
[471:16.30]Yes.
[471:19.97]Alright.
[471:20.51]That was... This one here?
[471:24.71]Yeah.
[471:30.23]Blue cheeseburger sounds good.
[471:32.10]Oh, it is.
[471:32.62]Alright, so now I got... I'm ready to play.
[471:36.04]I've upgraded the weapon twice.
[471:39.78]The little chip damage I was doing to him is now going to be real damage, and I'm going to really kill him.
[471:44.60]Alright, let's go.
[471:54.98]I am now prepared this time.
[471:56.28]Let's go, buddy.
[472:14.84]A lot of unnecessary damage here.
[472:32.05]Fuck.
[472:32.67]Okay.
[472:32.81]Whoa, what happened?
[472:34.85]Is that poison or something?
[472:38.67]What happened?
[472:41.24]He's still hard to kill.
[472:43.84]There's a dot.
[472:48.58]He has very varied swings, but there's a lot of telegraphing on them.
[472:51.98]I'll get it.
[472:54.18]He has a bleed tick.
[472:55.33]Oh, that piece of shit.
[472:56.23]Alright.
[472:56.47]Let's go.
[472:56.75]Let's go.
[473:02.73]Let me drink this, too, while I'm out here.
[473:06.79]That will help.
[473:13.24]He's got fire bleed on his sword.
[473:14.70]What a punk.
[473:31.65]Yeah, I'm all fucked up now.
[473:38.88]Again, isn't that insane?
[473:39.94]The first try, I dodged almost every single fucking one of these, like perfectly.
[473:44.96]And now it's like I can't even fucking, I'm like trapped in a fucking bag.
[473:49.95]I can't get out.
[473:54.53]It's so weird why that happens.
[473:57.61]That's so strange.
[474:04.25]I got him down to like 40% health first try, and then it's just like, now he's just killing me instantly.
[474:09.66]It's so weird.
[474:12.42]I think it's just like, I just don't care, right?
[474:13.96]When you first see a boss for the first time, you're like, I don't give a shit if I lose or not.
[474:16.95]Like, who cares?
[474:17.75]I'm like trying too hard.
[474:19.61]I don't care, kill me.
[474:20.45]Kill me right now.
[474:28.17]so so
[475:02.30]You prick.
[475:12.51]Can you... I'm trying to backstab.
[475:14.01]I can't get it.
[475:17.20]I'm trying to... I feel like I'm right behind him.
[475:25.02]can I I feel like I was right behind him wait for the jump attack yeah he does like the here I come swing and then the jump I try to get behind him well I wonder can I stagger him maybe I should just do jump attacks
[475:57.87]I'm not gonna go for it.
[475:58.53]I'll just try to kill him.
[475:59.09]You can!
[476:06.50]Alright, buddy.
[476:07.68]That's a big deal.
[476:22.71]Oh, come on.
[476:23.21]I thought I got around it.
[476:26.09]Got it.
[476:46.53]Thank you for watching
[477:06.23]He jumps, fuck.
[477:07.07]I thought it was a swing.
[477:33.80]Fuck these stupid fucking cinder blocks in the way!
[477:36.46]Is he heal again?
[477:43.94]Fuck you.
[478:01.53]That's the strat, man.
[478:02.47]That's the strat.
[478:06.41]You just gotta get the backstab.
[478:09.00]This is easy now.
[478:10.36]That's the strat.
[478:14.54]Yeah.
[478:15.86]That makes this fight no problem.
[478:24.27]Yeah.
[478:24.55]Oh, yeah.
[478:32.19]Okay.
[478:36.44]Okay.
[478:36.72]Yeah.
[478:39.24]Alright.
[478:40.80]Okay.
[478:41.62]So that... This is farewell, my dear.
[478:44.18]Tell Blyde... Discarded palace key.
[478:56.04]This is like escape room levels of how much more shit do I have to do?
[479:00.30]There's more to do.
[479:02.66]Hold on.
[479:05.86]Let me see.
[479:06.26]What the fuck else do I have to do here?
[479:17.61]What else is in here?
[479:19.39]Is this just this area?
[479:28.01]I did not think this was going to be this crazy.
[479:29.89]I thought this was literally going to be just like, go take this item here, take that item there, take that item there, and then maybe fight a boss.
[479:37.81]This has been like five straight hours of just doing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[479:49.28]Opens a treasure chest pass down to Carrion Princesses.
[479:53.95]It is said to be found in the Grand Library of Raya Lucaria with her mother Rinella.
[480:02.12]We're going to the Grand Library.
[480:16.15]That was cool.
[480:18.10]He's going to hit a really cool move.
[480:20.11]I almost kind of wish that he didn't do that move that frequently because I really liked that fight.
[480:25.69]It was really cool.
[480:35.40]Oh, this is all the way down here now.
[480:38.80]Lake of Rat.
[480:39.52]Lake of Rat.
[480:47.76]This looks like a boss.
[480:50.12]This looks like a big boss.
[480:51.57]Don't think I want to do this right now.
[480:55.05]Lake of Rat.
[480:56.29]Let's go to the academy, right?
[480:59.43]Library.
[481:02.58]Grand Library.
[481:03.46]Take care of yourself, man.
[481:07.86]No, I'm alright.
[481:08.76]I'm good.
[481:10.92]I will say, if we get to another boss, I'm probably...
[481:19.04]This is that chest.
[481:20.90]This is this chest.
[481:24.56]What?
[481:24.94]It's this one.
[481:26.34]Behind the boss?
[481:32.97]Dark moon ring.
[481:34.31]It's another key.
[481:36.87]It's that chest.
[481:38.59]Okay.
[481:40.47]Very cool, very cool, very cool.
[481:50.55]Ring of Lunar Princess Ranni's Cold Oath.
[482:00.93]Whoever thou mayest be, take not the ring from this place.
[482:03.46]The solitude beyond the night is better mine alone.
[482:08.26]Okay.
[482:13.86]I'll be honest with you guys.
[482:20.68]I opened a fucking guide up.
[482:26.78]I see- I can see everything.
[482:32.44]Obviously.
[482:38.43]I didn't start cheating until it got to a point where it was like, how- okay, now I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[482:45.70]Only since like the last BRB was I actually using it.
[482:48.64]And I wasn't even using it.
[482:49.68]I would look over and see what you guys had to say.
[482:51.12]Fake reactions.
[482:54.72]What, where do I go next?
[482:55.88]Hold on.
[482:57.38]Collect the miniature Ranni doll and talk to the Grace until it speaks?
[483:01.34]Bro, what happened?
[483:02.68]What do I have to do?
[483:05.18]I have to, I swear to God, I promise, I have not really been using this shit at all.
[483:11.65]It's fair.
[483:12.45]I know it's fair because we've been working on this together.
[483:16.63]I only have it over here in case I need it.
[483:21.31]In case we couldn't figure it out.
[483:23.65]Look, how many times have I opened it up and said, oh, yo, that's where I need to go, right?
[483:29.40]This is just in case.
[483:31.48]I'm not even using it.
[483:34.32]I'm not even using it, I promise.
[483:35.84]Since the last BRB, I swear to God, I had it open and I was like, no, I'm not going to use it.
[483:42.08]And then I just looked at it for a second.
[483:44.12]Close it right now.
[483:45.62]I'm only going line by line.
[483:47.36]I'm not reading what happens next.
[483:49.68]You felt guilty, that's why.
[483:50.76]I can't lie to you guys.
[483:55.31]I can't lie to you guys.
[483:57.89]We don't wrangle us in.
[483:59.51]No, because look, I'd go like this.
[484:01.55]I'd go, oh shit, I just got that item.
[484:04.15]That's where I need to go.
[484:05.35]And then people go, oh yeah, you do have to go there.
[484:07.36]And I go, what is that?
[484:15.75]You just reminded the teacher of homework.
[484:18.11]Alright, so now what?
[484:18.97]I'm not going to look over here.
[484:19.91]Because I don't want to... I'm not going to look at it.
[484:22.81]I told you I'm not going to use it.
[484:28.77]So where do I go?
[484:29.17]I'm not going to look at it.
[484:31.45]See, you guys are even... Does it really matter?
[484:33.89]You guys are writing all the answers anyways.
[484:36.26]Within 10 seconds of me picking the item up.
[484:40.18]Okay.
[484:41.02]Go back to Lake of Rat.
[484:42.22]I'm not looking at the guide.
[484:44.07]Fuck that guy.
[484:44.89]I don't want it anymore.
[484:46.31]In fact, I'm gonna click it out.
[484:47.83]I'm gonna click the X. I got it.
[484:52.84]Why is he manipulating us?
[484:54.04]I'm not!
[484:54.68]I've actually genuinely not looked at it.
[484:56.60]I'm just telling you I have it just in case we need it.
[485:00.12]Active Rot Lake?
[485:04.52]Maybe.
[485:07.46]Not yet.
[485:14.74]Go back to the lake rod.
[485:16.59]See?
[485:16.89]I didn't even look over here.
[485:17.65]You know that was legit.
[485:18.69]I was like, how the fuck am I supposed to know what I'm doing?
[485:25.79]I only opened it just in case.
[485:27.67]Because it was like, holy shit, this is turning into kind of a convoluted, crazy thing.
[485:31.22]Okay, here we go.
[485:33.76]Spirit Tuning.
[485:47.72]I think this thing sucks.
[485:49.48]I'm definitely going to do Oleg.
[485:51.44]Or should I?
[485:51.98]Should I do Mimic and get Mimic up all the way?
[486:00.49]The Mimic is broken, dude.
[486:02.11]Please, just do it.
[486:08.37]It's Souls.
[486:09.13]I'm going to sell some shit.
[486:17.26]Seems kind of crappy.
[486:18.18]Some of this shit is really cool, but I'm never gonna use it.
[486:39.73]Start getting rid of stuff.
[486:47.62]This stuff is so cool, but I'm not going to use it on this character ever.
[486:49.68]Three of these.
[487:02.06]Yeah, get rid of the arrows.
[487:03.28]I can get a lot of these.
[487:17.05]Don't sell all the weapons.
[487:18.13]No, I'm not.
[487:18.89]Just the ones I know I'm not going to use.
[487:22.57]I physically will never be able to put this on.
[487:24.99]It's cool, but I'll never be able to use it. 2,000.
[487:54.35]Getting rid of doubles too.
[487:55.73]Relax.
[487:56.09]Relax.
[487:59.17]Relax.
[488:00.37]What is in storage?
[488:01.67]I want the souls.
[488:09.87]Alright.
[488:10.23]Let's go.
[488:10.77]Let's do it.
[488:11.23]Let's go.
[488:11.71]Let's go.
[488:12.19]Rot Lake.
[488:12.70]Rot Lake.
[488:13.16]Rot Lake.
[488:16.00]Arm for five minutes?
[488:17.10]No.
[488:17.30]I'm not going to use them.
[488:18.50]When am I going to use those?
[488:23.32]When am I going to use those?
[488:26.68]Please take the spin off of your staff.
[488:30.61]It's too late.
[488:34.77]Okay.
[488:35.73]So you're saying go down here.
[488:38.15]This is really cool looking.
[488:39.57]I love the way this looks.
[488:40.49]This looks like Ghostbusters 2.
[488:41.35]Uh, that's not gonna work.
[488:58.97]Rot Lake.
[489:06.22]I like, this has got to be something cool up here, right?
[489:08.22]No.
[489:10.58]Uh, can I, where's my horse?
[489:12.18]No.
[489:12.38]Alright, I need like anti-rot gear.
[489:19.98]Is it immunity or robustness?
[489:21.31]Which one is it?
[489:23.03]Probably immunity, right?
[489:29.39]Immunity.
[489:29.81]Yeah.
[489:33.06]It's the best thing I have.
[489:33.72]Okay, the foot soldier tabard is the best thing I have for that.
[489:48.34]No, the horns are... Scarab.
[490:02.49]Okay.
[490:04.27]Good soldier gauntlets.
[490:09.20]Good soldier greaves.
[490:12.78]Okay.
[490:23.04]Now does it just run across the lake?
[490:26.18]To like where?
[490:39.25]How do I get this off?
[490:49.45]I need soap.
[490:52.35]Soap.
[490:53.47]I can't use the horse here.
[490:54.33]Just kill me.
[490:56.27]I get it.
[490:57.87]Kill me.
[491:03.26]I get it.
[491:10.92]Just run and tank it.
[491:17.96]Run towards the statues.
[491:21.05]I have those, like, boluses things.
[491:23.55]Alleviates scarlet rot buildup and cures rot.
[491:30.18]I can make so many of these, can't I?
[491:32.10]I can only make two.
[491:34.06]Can I make soap?
[491:45.79]Should I make a hundred of these?
[491:54.03]Okay, um... I'll try the soap first.
[492:07.50]Here we go.
[492:13.00]I gotta get that item.
[492:22.00]That didn't fucking do anything!
[492:27.08]That didn't do anything.
[492:29.80]That didn't do anything.
[492:36.24]I just made 20 soaps for no reason.
[492:40.62]That's a plus 8 Smithing Stone.
[492:42.04]I can get the katana to 8.
[492:47.18]Whatever, just run around.
[492:47.92]Who cares?
[492:52.55]Read that one in your guide.
[492:53.61]I have not been using a guide.
[492:57.95]Ever.
[492:58.57]The only time I used it was when I opened it because it looked like this was going to get confusing.
[493:04.23]This quest.
[493:05.27]I've played 50 hours of this game without a guide.
[493:08.01]You and I have been talking and trying to figure out what the fuck, man.
[493:10.89]Where do I go?
[493:12.14]I haven't even used it.
[493:40.63]Somebody said, dude, it's really cute that you've been pretending like you don't know where to go.
[493:45.56]We can see the reflection of the guide on your forehead.
[493:52.22]I swear to God, I want to experience the game.
[493:56.98]Let me ask you this.
[493:57.84]Do you really think I'm using a guide if I didn't know what a sacred tear did until literally yesterday?
[494:03.38]Do you think I'm using a guide if I didn't have the physique flask until 40 hours into the game?
[494:09.61]Do you think I'm... I'm just... I don't... What are you talking about?
[494:15.79]I'm dead.
[494:16.05]Alright, I got the items over here.
[494:25.32]I didn't know that sacred tears were in churches until like seven game, like 12 game hours ago.
[494:36.43]You're getting a tactical advantage.
[494:37.79]Alright.
[494:38.09]So just tank it and run.
[494:42.13]I got the items over there.
[494:43.23]We're going to go get the items over here.
[494:48.51]An item run.
[494:49.05]Relax.
[495:01.51]Doesn't the rock grease just sound like a big fat guy is cooking food for you?
[495:08.53]You want some of that rock grease?
[495:11.07]It's healthy.
[495:11.57]It's fine.
[495:13.09]Rock grease to me sounds like they didn't change the fry-a-later oil.
[495:17.79]And I have something about it like I don't care.
[495:23.86]That's weirdly appetizing to me.
[495:25.58]I don't know why.
[495:26.32]Is that strange?
[495:36.53]I don't know, like something about like, oh, oh, like grease.
[495:38.93]I don't know.
[495:39.23]I don't know something about it.
[495:40.09]Maybe I sound good somehow.
[495:43.81]In a cartoon pretend way, you know what I mean?
[495:46.11]I was just seeing if there was any items over there.
[495:51.62]Everyone relax.
[495:56.14]You sound delirious.
[495:56.96]Just get to the ball.
[495:57.60]I'm just telling you, it's a cartoon world I'm talking about.
[496:02.62]I'm not going to go put like rot grease on my hot dog.
[496:07.56]I'm not gonna put rot grease on, like, my cheeseburger later.
[496:10.32]I'm just saying, like, ah, grease, like, rot grease.
[496:13.36]Just sounds like something, like, a big, fat cartoon character would put on his hot dog.
[496:17.88]And in that world, in that context, I'd be like, that's not bad.
[496:22.46]Wait, what the fuck just happened?
[496:27.06]What did I just step on?
[496:31.80]Did I just drain the lake?
[496:33.94]Of rot?
[496:36.82]Is it still rotted?
[496:39.12]What happened?
[496:39.56]I summoned platforms.
[496:54.78]Are they going to be there now permanently?
[497:06.18]Read your guide.
[497:07.00]I shouldn't have even said anything because like I just I opened it just in case like I needed it and I've never used that shit.
[497:13.78]You know I've been playing without it and stuff but like and everybody knows that we're just like hanging out.
[497:21.94]Now everybody thinks I'm a guide Andy and I'm not.
[497:25.83]You told us not to tell online chat.
[497:28.32]You betrayed yourself.
[497:29.96]But I actually haven't been using it.
[497:32.16]Everybody in offline chat knows I opened the guide.
[497:34.30]But I haven't been using it.
[497:35.16]I haven't used it.
[497:35.96]You know it.
[497:36.34]I haven't.
[497:38.28]I'm not using a guide.
[497:39.22]I'm not.
[497:40.32]I'm not.
[497:41.46]I'm not doing that.
[497:49.94]Fuck.
[497:50.12]I'm probably going to wash that off.
[498:04.93]Stop jumping!
[498:05.83]Oh my god, he's delirious!
[498:09.75]I- I'm trying to get up here.
[498:12.07]There's nothing- I thought it was a button.
[498:22.86]Warming stone?
[498:25.86]Warming stone.
[498:36.43]Any more buttons?
[498:43.12]There's gotta be like another button over here somewhere.
[498:44.64]Right there.
[498:50.41]Is that a strat?
[499:00.54]Jesus.
[499:03.14]Jesus.
[499:08.22]Alright.
[499:09.64]Okay.
[499:15.80]Use the soap.
[499:16.78]Use the soap.
[499:17.76]Use the soap.
[499:19.38]It's too late now.
[499:25.28]Is this thing gonna stand up?
[499:26.78]This thing's gonna stand up.
[499:30.57]Yeah, it is gonna stand up.
[499:34.06]That's a rotted dragon.
[499:35.28]Dragon can rot.
[499:44.55]How are you supposed to fight this guy down here in the rot?
[499:47.11]How are you supposed to fight that guy?
[500:06.38]Alright, I'm almost at the end.
[500:10.58]Soap cleans off the effect.
[500:12.02]Literal brain rot.
[500:13.43]No, it's not brain rot.
[500:17.61]That, if this doesn't clean this, this guy, I want that person timed out for one second.
[500:23.35]I'm up for one second.
[500:33.92]You don't have the effect yet.
[500:40.07]It doesn't work on the effect either.
[500:41.30]I tried it.
[500:41.66]Alright.
[500:55.04]I need to do... I need to go that way.
[500:57.02]Because that's what I was told I needed to do.
[500:58.70]And yeah, we got to end the stream.
[501:01.73]Don't do that yet.
[501:03.55]Dumb idiot.
[501:06.85]Wait.
[501:11.53]I'm going that way.
[501:13.11]I'm going that way.
[501:13.93]And I'm going to those two statues.
[501:17.84]Use the pellets.
[501:18.84]I don't want to use them.
[501:22.80]We're streaming Elden Ring tomorrow.
[501:26.82]Four o'clock.
[501:28.08]The stream is going to end very, very, very soon.
[501:31.79]Oh, fuck you.
[501:35.97]Oh, it don't matter.
[501:36.55]Just go.
[501:44.37]Does it really actually matter either way?
[501:46.25]No.
[501:47.47]I think there's a platform to jump on and touch right here, though.
[501:49.39]I'm going to do it.
[501:59.06]Already got that one.
[501:59.90]Is there another one over here somewhere?
[502:00.94]I don't think so.
[502:04.18]Whatever, just go to the statue.
[502:22.27]Is there a button here?
[502:29.32]There is.
[502:29.66]Hey, hey.
[502:29.96]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[502:30.74]I don't want to go up here.
[502:31.50]Hey.
[502:34.58]Oh, shit.
[502:35.14]It's supermarket sweep.
[502:36.30]I've got to find as many items as I can right now before I die.
[502:54.48]I'm good.
[503:03.40]What's the guide say?
[503:13.62]R1, R1.
[503:16.42]L2, R1, R1, R1, start.
[503:22.78]Got a lot of health.
[503:51.75]What?
[503:57.59]Alabaster.
[503:58.45]What is that?
[504:07.95]Where is it?
[504:11.61]Alabaster Lord Sword.
[504:17.43]It's a great sword.
[504:17.99]This thing is fucking ugly.
[504:30.06]Seems kind of really good though.
[504:32.30]This is an ugly ass sword though.
[504:35.56]It looks like shit.
[504:56.18]Spinning Stone 9.
[505:01.74]Major decision needs to be made here soon.
[505:03.47]Anything on the other side of that?
[505:06.61]Probably not.
[505:09.41]Alright.
[505:13.09]Play Mario Golf next Thursday.
[505:14.86]I... I'm not gonna play Mario Golf, man.
[505:18.46]Like, that's just not gonna happen.
[505:26.04]I don't know.
[505:27.01]If I played Mario Golf with a bunch of other streamers or something, that might be fun.
[505:29.77]But I'm not just going to play it.
[505:33.19]Okay.
[505:34.87]I think I'm going to die if I fall here.
[505:36.49]Can I even get down?
[505:40.69]How do I get down from here?
[505:43.19]Place on the right and that.
[505:46.62]How do I get down?
[505:55.66]Is there a ladder?
[505:59.92]Just play it alone in total silence.
[506:06.22]Horse can't summon the horse here.
[506:16.17]There is a ladder.
[506:27.02]It goes this way.
[506:27.98]What's over here?
[506:46.09]No!
[506:46.91]No, no, no.
[506:47.79]I need it.
[506:48.15]I need it.
[506:48.55]I need whatever it is.
[506:49.19]What was it?
[506:53.19]Smithing Stone?
[507:02.02]That's right.
[507:37.40]Made it.
[508:08.13]Alright, so you want me to go in here.
[508:11.23]What was I in here for?
[508:12.15]Still doing Ronnie's quest.
[508:21.46]Alright.
[508:23.22]This is just going to go on forever, isn't it?
[508:26.34]I'm not checking the guide.
[508:27.24]I'm not using a guide.
[508:28.10]There's an item back here.
[508:33.67]I'm so lazy, I'm literally just going to do this right now.
[508:49.88]a coffin down there.
[508:52.39]We're going to do it tomorrow.
[508:53.95]Because it is way too late.
[508:55.37]I want to go in there though.
[509:10.56]Real quick.
[509:13.56]Just really quickly.
[509:14.38]Okay.
[509:19.50]Who cares if I get the rod?
[509:20.40]I don't care.
[509:20.68]Alright, I want to go in here.
[509:37.67]Alright, yeah.
[509:42.84]Chest right here.
[509:46.39]That's so cool that that key leads all the way back to that library.
[509:54.40]Alright.
[509:55.18]That's it.
[509:55.46]I'm going to stop it right here.
[510:00.99]I'm going to sit at the fire.
[510:07.13]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[510:13.78]I'm going to go eat some food.
[510:14.64]I'm going to rest my voice for a little bit because it's kind of getting a little junky.
[510:26.89]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[510:32.17]Let me put on the credits.
[510:37.05]Tomorrow at 4 p.m.
[510:37.99]the P.T.? ?
[510:47.71]So, how... I haven't really done... I didn't do any of the main kind of quest line today, did I?
[510:53.88]Just kind of running around doing this stuff.
[511:00.16]I really like this area.
[511:01.05]This is a really cool spot.
[511:04.31]How... Much more realistically, percentage-wise, like, where am I percentage-wise in the game?
[511:12.49]Realistically.
[511:13.01]Okay.
[511:18.05]30 to 40%.
[511:21.27]40, maybe 50%.
[511:22.45]That's ridiculous.
[511:26.93]You are legit like 50%.
[511:28.49]That's crazy.
[511:34.83]So this really is like 100 plus.
[511:38.13]This is a 100 plus hour game.
[511:41.72]On a first playthrough without seeing everything.
[511:45.52]That's ridiculous.
[511:52.13]The game took me about 80 hours to fully explore it.
[511:54.37]I believe I'm like 48, 49 hours in.
[511:59.67]So that's still another 30 to 40 plus hours.
[512:09.68]Are you liking the game?
[512:10.54]Yeah?
[512:12.88]I mean, I think it's ridiculous.
[512:16.68]It's really easy to get overwhelmed.
[512:19.33]But I think what I have to start doing is... I didn't do this yesterday.
[512:22.55]And this is what we're going to... I did it today.
[512:25.28]Is... I picked... Four or five things that I wanted to go do.
[512:30.98]Specific areas I wanted to go look at.
[512:34.41]And just did those.
[512:35.97]And if something led to another thing.
[512:37.53]If that thing led to another thing.
[512:38.81]I did that too.
[512:40.99]Yesterday I kind of just was wandering around.
[512:42.51]I got like lost.
[512:44.71]And I didn't really have any direction or anything.
[512:46.93]But I definitely like the idea of picking a few places to go.
[512:51.21]But yeah.
[512:58.99]Thanks for watching guys.
[512:59.65]See you tomorrow.
[513:00.59]4 o'clock Pacific.
[513:02.59]Same thing.
[513:03.01]Elden Ring.
[513:05.11]After tomorrow's stream, we're going to have to evaluate what I want to do with this game.
[513:08.91]We're going to have to evaluate what the plan is, because I don't want to just stream Elden Ring only.
[513:17.11]It's other stuff I'd like to do.
[513:20.50]We'll find out after tomorrow.
[513:21.64]Are you going to drop it after the stream tomorrow?
[513:28.02]I don't know.
[513:28.64]I don't think so.
[513:36.36]Maybe we sprinkle in some Mario Golf.
[513:41.38]Come back to it.
[513:41.94]The problem with coming back to it, and this is the problem with all Souls games, is my fear of not playing this game for more than two or three days.
[513:53.46]Coming back to this game a week or two later...
[513:58.60]You just you're gonna get your ass kicked and it's gonna be hard to get back into the swing of things to remember where anything was To have the timings down It's it's rough to come back to a FromSoftware game if you don't play it for like a few weeks So if I were to stop playing it every day or every stream It would it would have to be a case of alright, we're gonna do Mario Golf and
[514:27.58]And then, like, the next day we're going to play Elden Ring.
[514:30.80]Two days in a row.
[514:32.24]Right?
[514:32.40]There are going to be a lot of streams, I think, for me to continue to want to play this.
[514:40.45]But we'll see.
[514:40.99]I mean, I might just keep going as of tomorrow as well.
[514:54.40]We'll see.
[514:56.79]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[514:57.73]We'll pick up right here.
[514:58.54]Take care of yourselves.
[515:00.66]See you guys soon.
[515:04.49]Have a good one.
[515:05.89]Bye.
[515:30.59]Really important before I go.
[515:31.83]Did the frame drop stop?
[515:36.75]And if they did, when?
[515:43.55]It kept going the whole way?
[515:45.24]Even up until like right now?
[515:49.22]Did they actually get better or has it still been happening?
[515:52.70]Maybe like an hour ago?
[516:01.12]They weren't as bad as they were a few minutes ago.
[516:04.40]Yeah, so this is definitely not an internet problem for me yet.
[516:07.51]Like, 1 o'clock in the morning?
[516:10.33]No way.
[516:17.11]Yeah.
[516:18.14]I confirmed it a few times anyways.
[516:19.40]Hopefully that, whatever routing issue or server issue that's happening with Twitch, I really hope that gets resolved, because that would suck.
[516:30.13]Alright, goodnight.
[516:30.71]See you tomorrow.
