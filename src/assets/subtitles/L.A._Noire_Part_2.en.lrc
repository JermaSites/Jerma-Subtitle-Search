[00:02.17]There it is.
[00:07.25]So with that being said, we are going to get to a point here where the internet is going to actually, actually turn off.
[00:16.50]So I don't know when.
[00:17.46]I can't predict when it's going to happen.
[00:18.80]It's just going to.
[00:20.86]So good luck to us, right?
[00:21.60]Turn this down.
[00:30.02]Muted.
[00:30.24]Muted.
[00:32.17]I'm not muted.
[00:32.55]I'm right here.
[00:35.51]Resume game.
[00:38.87]Not till tomorrow morning around 6 a.m.
[00:43.73]Oh my god.
[00:45.45]That would be so fucking terrible.
[00:53.52]This champagne sucks.
[00:58.52]Why is my internet shutting off?
[00:59.52]Because this is the last part of the billing cycle until the first.
[01:04.02]And I didn't want to have the bill carry over to the next month.
[01:10.85]Actually, Time Warner shut me off.
[01:12.17]It was about 5 a.m.
[01:12.67]Well, that's going to be fun.
[01:17.86]It's a 14-day grace period.
[01:25.79]No, it's not.
[01:26.85]No, it's not.
[01:33.45]It's gonna be like a long fucking stream.
[01:37.78]No, it's... Well, whatever.
[01:40.68]We got other... We got missions to do.
[01:44.14]Welcome to Until They Turn Us Up.
[01:48.20]One month race period.
[01:49.69]Holy fuck, that'd be so horrible.
[01:51.38]It pays the rent, though.
[01:52.98]Keeps Mrs. Phelps in the manner to which she's accustomed.
[01:56.12]No, you can't sleep on stream.
[01:57.72]No, I'm not going to have to do that.
[01:59.32]Alright, let's go.
[02:05.31]So what was the last thing we did?
[02:08.85]Dab or pre-recorded?
[02:10.43]We finally collared him on Temple.
[02:15.77]Where's the locations?
[02:18.81]Stolen vehicle call.
[02:21.12]Make it the current destination.
[02:22.13]It is... Sleepover on stream.
[02:30.25]No fucking sleepovers.
[02:32.37]Guys, I can barely go, like, four hours.
[02:34.00]I think I can go, like, 24 hours.
[02:35.60]Alright, where the fuck am I going?
[02:41.42]There, I'll follow the exit signs, maybe.
[02:46.05]Alright.
[02:47.35]I'm driving.
[02:52.13]He's stalling.
[02:53.15]Well, not really.
[02:54.51]I just had a goddamn party, guys.
[02:59.23]At a timer?
[03:06.07]I don't know when it's going to turn off.
[03:10.96]This might stay on for a lot longer than I think.
[03:16.12]Captain Donnelly seems to think they have it all wrapped up.
[03:18.70]Brown and green are sweating this manly character.
[03:21.04]I heard it'll be in front of a grand jury by next week.
[03:22.80]Do I have a Discord?
[03:23.42]Yeah, I do.
[03:24.98]If you type in exclamation point Discord, you'll see it.
[03:28.54]It's a great community.
[03:30.40]I highly suggest you go check it out.
[03:41.33]Right on time.
[03:42.17]Right on schedule.
[03:50.02]I like that tie.
[03:50.46]Chase him.
[03:50.70]Get him.
[03:50.98]Punch him.
[03:51.34]So he needs to be healthy to answer questions.
[03:52.92]Okay.
[03:53.02]It's not gonna be nudity.
[03:57.72]And if there is... Whatever.
[03:58.46]Everybody has streamed this game.
[04:02.30]I'm like the last person to stream this fucking game.
[04:19.69]So if I'm going down for that, then wait, what does he want me to do?
[04:24.91]I just took his bumper off.
[04:26.65]God damn it.
[04:27.11]This game has a lot of nudity.
[04:34.68]Why?
[04:37.78]Turn that off.
[04:38.28]It's giving me anxiety.
[04:43.62]Oh my God.
[04:44.30]Why would I read chat at that point?
[04:45.96]Come on.
[04:58.67]I'll get him.
[05:00.04]Look.
[05:01.24]Good, I got the Luigi.
[05:06.76]Got him.
[05:07.04]I didn't hit the cop.
[05:07.82]He jumped around.
[05:08.86]Hmm.
[05:09.58]Alright, let's see.

[05:53.12]Okay, 2450.

[07:13.64]It's a sedan?
[07:14.96]I knew that.
[07:15.38]Who cares?
[07:15.82]It was only $1.90 for this car.
[07:19.36]Holy shit.

[07:24.46]What?
[07:25.56]Alright, motive.
[07:25.98]Do you have a criminal record, Mr. Harrison?
[07:28.30]No.
[07:29.27]Nothing like that.
[07:32.12]Ah, he opened his mouth and had his mouth go up like, heh.
[07:39.71]You better give us something, Cliff, or we're gonna make this hard on you.
[07:43.09]I didn't steal the car.
[07:44.37]I ran because... Because I've got some wacky-backy in the glove compartment.
[07:47.96]What's a wacky-backy?
[07:48.58]How much, Cliff?
[07:49.48]One reefer.
[07:51.08]We'll let it slide.
[07:52.10]You're in enough trouble.
[07:55.93]Vehicle purchase details?
[07:57.85]Okay.
[07:58.11]Oh, it's weed.
[08:00.87]Okay.
[08:04.41]Bullshit.
[08:08.23]I don't know if I believe that.
[08:10.95]Well, maybe he did.
[08:13.49]Wacky tabacky.
[08:20.15]How did you not know that?
[08:21.25]I knew what it was.
[08:22.09]I was just being... I was just being...
[08:25.33]You understand?
[08:26.57]That's what I was doing.
[08:29.19]And he made out the bill of sale personally?
[08:31.17]Of course he did.
[08:32.39]He kept a facsimile for his records.
[08:34.09]Check with him.
[08:37.18]We're going to get to the bottom of this, Harrison.
[08:39.36]Until we do, you're going downtown.
[08:42.39]Put him in a bag.
[08:43.49]Just put him in a trash bag and throw him in the backseat.
[08:45.29]What the fuck did you just do?
[08:46.39]Alright, let's go.
[09:13.58]Oh boy.
[09:16.71]Some of the most convincing people you'll ever listen to are born liars.
[09:19.49]That's what it's called.
[09:20.80]Usually they're called politicians.
[09:27.16]Take it easy, Phelps.
[09:28.12]I'd rather get there in one piece.
[09:28.96]Do you know who my father is?
[09:29.94]He's one of those things where you could use it in any circumstance and people might actually back down to you for a minute.
[09:38.15]You know, you order something at McDonald's and they get it wrong.
[09:42.05]I wanted a McChicken plain.
[09:44.11]Do you know who my father is?
[09:45.13]Oh, shit.
[09:46.81]Okay, yeah, I'll fix that.
[09:49.31]You spout all this communist crap about treating everybody the same, but it only works one way.
[09:54.23]I'm not sure that's communism, Stefan.
[09:57.92]Yeah, it seems that you have, uh... You have some, uh... You have a problem with your sciatic nerve.
[10:06.13]Oh, yeah?
[10:06.49]You think I do?
[10:07.33]Doctor?

[11:13.69]Not another step.
[11:15.09]I have got a Buick Century sedan that would be absolutely perfect for you.
[11:19.95]Punch as hard as I can.
[11:20.93]Detective Phelps, LAPD.
[11:22.45]Are you the owner?
[11:23.41]That's right.
[11:24.45]Richard Coombs at your service.
[11:26.87]You looking to trade in a black and white, boys?
[11:29.28]Mr. Coombs.
[11:29.96]His teeth are weird to me.
[11:31.24]I don't know why.
[11:32.06]A man by the name of Cliff Harrison claims he bought the car here.
[11:35.04]Well, some people would say that my cars are a steal.
[11:40.40]That's a joke, son.
[11:42.01]Very amusing, Mr. Cone.
[11:43.50]I remember here.
[11:44.58]It was a green two-tone Kaiser Fraser, if I remember rightly.
[11:48.70]How would you have the bill of sale?
[11:49.68]Wait, I didn't skip that.
[11:50.38]It's in my office.
[11:51.00]Why is it skipping this?
[11:51.56]Walk this way.
[11:56.86]What the fuck was that?
[11:57.90]That's a joke too, son.
[12:00.78]What?
[12:01.10]Do you mind if I shoot this guy?
[12:02.36]He's getting on my nerves.
[12:11.18]Why did he just do that?
[12:17.53]Look at his head.
[12:18.05]This guy's on like a bunch of drugs.
[12:22.05]Okay.
[12:22.27]Which one do I touch?
[12:23.37]Let's look at the photo.
[12:28.78]That's not a photo.
[12:34.86]I'm trying to read this.
[13:07.90]Why are we spamming creepers?
[13:13.75]Why is the chat all creepers?
[13:23.89]Why would I play Minecraft?
[13:25.58]I don't even have Minecraft on this fucking computer.
[13:40.37]I'm not gonna install- I don't even know my username and password!
[13:54.65]No, I need to find out who stole the car.
[13:59.35]Buy it again- No, I have it- I think I have it on iPad.
[14:02.18]Before the stream turns off, I will play Minecraft on iPad.
[14:04.72]I just said that.
[14:05.82]I drank like a couple of sips of champagne, and I just said I would play Minecraft on my mobile device.
[14:11.79]What a fucking idiot I am.
[14:14.89]And now I opened up the mail, I said the thing, so now I have to do it.

[18:07.50]Association with a marquee.
[18:09.14]Do you know anything about the company that prints these pink slips?
[18:12.50]Nope.
[18:13.16]Should I?
[18:13.94]It isn't exactly my business.
[18:14.78]These bubbles are fucking hitting me hard.
[18:19.36]Look at the way he's sitting.

[18:30.30]Look at how he's sitting.
[18:30.92]He's sitting like this.

[19:59.56]It's time to stop being cute.
[20:02.78]I'm going to assume you're having a bad day.
[20:05.12]I sell cars, not paper.

[20:13.77]This was all above board.

[20:31.82]You want to, like, play this game?
[20:33.10]Let me tell you how to do this.
[20:34.80]Just... Anytime somebody mimics a famous actor, they're lying.
[20:41.99]We've had Robert De Niro.
[20:43.01]We've had Jack Nicholson.
[20:44.10]We've had, like, Jim Carrey.
[20:45.34]Like, if you're mimicking an actor that's a famous actor, you're a liar.
[20:58.78]But I don't have any evidence, though.
[21:00.50]I mean, I could just bad cop them, but... No internet connection.

[21:44.76]Now don't come on all high and mighty with me if you want my help.
[21:49.88]Thanks for your help, Mr. Combs.
[21:51.74]We need to continue the investigation.
[21:54.20]Hope you sort out your problem with Mr. Harrison.
[21:56.72]Go easy on him, son.

[22:03.39]Let me shoot this guy, please.
[22:05.77]You have a pleasant day, Mr. Combs.
[22:11.42]I did the other ones wrong.
[22:13.23]Well, you guys were yelling at me to play Minecraft.
[22:16.39]I was a little distracted.

[22:35.37]Pick up the phone.
[22:36.75]This is not a phone.
[22:40.14]This is not a phone.

[24:21.34]Locations.
[24:23.06]Alright, we've got Fremont Central Police Station, a printing company.
[24:26.10]Let's go to the printing company.
[24:27.78]I can't join the Discord.
[24:34.69]You won't hear anything.
[24:35.31]You've got it in for everyone today, haven't you?
[24:44.46]I'm not a bad driver.
[24:46.34]We got a crime.
[24:47.04]I like doing these little random things.
[24:50.48]I'm going to take off my pants.
[25:16.51]I'm going to turn the webcam on.
[25:17.25]You're not going to see me on camera again.
[25:20.05]For the rest of the... I'm not just... It's too hot down here.
[25:24.53]I'm wearing, like, fucking jeans.
[25:29.94]I'm good.
[25:33.74]Hey, look out for the pedestrian.
[25:42.71]Guy takes his pants off and drives into pedestrians.
[25:53.17]I told you I'm gonna play Minecraft.
[25:54.59]God damn it!
[25:55.51]Stop looking at the chatroom!
[25:57.75]I'm gonna play Minecraft.
[25:59.05]Yes, I will!
[25:59.71]I swear to God!
[26:04.38]I'm gonna have it on my iPad.
[26:07.44]Why?!
[26:07.80]You're gonna kill someone!
[26:19.21]Yeah, I'm going to play Minecraft.
[26:20.81]Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:22.51]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:23.67]Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.
[26:26.35]Let me just turn the webcam on for a second so we can make sure that I can do this in the background.
[26:30.13]That's the wrong one.
[26:31.09]Alright, guys.
[26:36.10]I'm just going to download it right now on PS4.
[26:39.12]But no, I... I have it on PS4.
[26:48.57]I'm not going to fuck with my internet, though.
[26:51.47]If they had a reason to turn me off, they could find it now.
[26:53.85]Alright, here we go.
[26:56.49]Let me download it.
[26:57.24]I can't fucking believe I'm doing this.
[27:00.36]Minecraft PlayStation 4 edition.
[27:01.60]I have it.
[27:01.94]I own it here.
[27:02.32]I'm going to just connect to the internet.
[27:10.38]This is what you guys wanted.
[27:12.84]I'm just doing what the people are asking me to do.
[27:16.27]Nothing more, nothing less.
[27:18.96]I mean, there are 3,700 people here watching, okay?
[27:23.44]At least, like, 30 of you have been spamming in the chat for me to play this, right?
[27:28.96]So 30 out of 3,700, that's a clean, that's a clean, like, 30 or 40%.
[27:34.85]So, I mean, you gotta give the people what they want, right?
[27:38.53]I don't know, let me just download it.
[27:49.64]Guy sits in chair.
[27:53.08]Somebody said chug?
[27:54.20]Somebody said chug it?
[27:58.84]Alright, ready?
[28:00.72]We're celebrating.

[28:03.84]Until I'm in Los... Well, that's not... There's another stream or two.
[28:06.72]Hopefully.
[28:07.60]There'll be another one.
[28:08.58]But this is the last stream from this house.
[28:09.88]Of course I'm gonna chug this.
[28:15.83]One.

[30:21.47]Guys, your stomach is this big.
[30:25.57]And when you fill it with gas, it's got to come out somewhere.
[30:31.50]My stomach just went from here.
[30:32.80]It's this big.
[30:33.92]Your stomach's as big as your fist, right?
[30:35.94]And then it gets inflated.
[30:38.16]So I got inflated.
[30:39.94]My stomach was this big.
[30:41.48]And then it just got like this.
[30:42.49]And then it just got like this.
[30:44.29]My stomach was this big.
[30:45.39]Did you see my shirt inflate?
[30:52.12]Alright, let me download this now.
[30:53.84]What was I doing?
[31:04.09]I'm gonna play L.A.
[31:04.75]No More.
[31:07.17]Guys, we got all night.
[31:09.01]You guys think this is gonna be like a two-hour stream.
[31:11.19]This is gonna be like a seven or fucking eight-hour stream.
[31:15.56]All this shit, that was just the beginning.
[31:17.34]That was just for fun.
[31:19.02]Now we're gonna sit here for a long time.
[31:22.12]I might as well download fucking Minecraft.
[31:23.92]Just have it downloading.
[31:25.64]So I can finally put that to rest forever.
[31:29.42]And then people will just leave me alone.
[31:34.04]Right?
[31:34.50]And it's just gonna be vanilla.
[31:35.46]It's not gonna be anything.
[31:36.02]It's gonna be vanilla Minecraft.
[31:42.70]I hope this doesn't fuck up my internet.
[31:45.62]It might.
[31:48.70]Just play Minecraft online.
[31:49.96]It's PS4.
[31:50.48]How am I going to do that?
[31:52.31]Alright, let's see if my frames start to drop here because I'm downloading this.
[32:04.83]I would laugh my ass off.
[32:07.86]Because I'm all punched into this one internet here now.
[32:11.46]Yeah, we're good.
[32:13.04]It's downloading.
[32:13.84]Fucking who cares.
[32:15.82]Alright, back to what we were doing.
[32:19.34]Auto peed.
[32:25.54]What do you mean auto peed?
[32:29.38]Really?
[32:30.23]Where?
[32:31.39]Where did he pee?
[32:39.03]Auto peed?
[32:41.19]Just give me a second.
[33:46.57]What the fuck are you guys talking about?
[33:58.13]I really, why, first of all, why the fuck would Kim tell, everybody was writing that.
[34:07.10]Everybody was writing that.
[34:07.96]Like it was as clear as day that's what was happening.
[34:13.83]Fucking Jesus Christ.
[34:15.69]Alright, well, I'm downloading that game.
[34:20.22]Back to LA tomorrow.
[34:22.28]See you later.
[34:23.76]One more chug, just for fucking fun, you know what I mean?
[34:52.46]What?
[34:52.68]Oh.
[34:52.86]That stuff works, by the way, if you were curious.
[34:57.24]Oh, what happened?
[35:00.44]What's going on?
[35:01.06]I'm lost.
[35:24.98]Oh, I don't understand.
[35:25.74]How do I get up there?
[35:28.58]Get the hell down from there, you lunatic!
[35:34.26]I like these sequins.
[35:34.92]It's fun.
[35:41.09]The ladder.
[35:41.55]Get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get.
[35:44.73]How am I doing?
[35:45.19]You really enjoying the stream?
[35:45.99]Hey, thanks, man.
[35:47.59]I'm doing just great.
[35:48.69]It's a good day today.
[35:50.49]You really need to lay off the pills.
[35:57.64]It's been a few days.
[35:58.76]I forget how you fucking fight.
[36:02.23]What is it square?
[36:03.65]What's the fight button?
[36:09.13]I don't know.
[36:09.87]I'm hitting X. It's not working.
[36:12.61]Is it R1?
[36:14.91]X. X square.
[36:16.30]Circle.
[36:16.72]Triangle.
[36:17.60]Nothing works.
[36:19.46]Okay, there it is.
[36:35.83]Just hit him twice.
[36:39.63]I got punched in the face like ten fucking times.
[36:47.30]Are you sure that he didn't just make money from taking a fall there?
[36:53.58]Alright.
[36:55.02]Alright!
[36:55.64]There was a burglary!
[36:56.98]I was like, who is this guy?
[37:02.95]That was a side mission.
[37:04.09]For a second, I'm like, what?
[37:09.83]What does this guy have to do with the pace?
[37:12.61]Oh, no.
[37:18.94]He peed again.
[37:19.98]No, he did not.
[37:21.22]I went up there and I'm like, Kim, where did he pee?
[37:23.24]On the carpet?
[37:23.78]She's like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[37:29.92]She was visibly upset with me already.
[37:31.82]I don't understand why.
[37:32.76]I'm like, where did he pee?
[37:37.00]She's like, he didn't.
[37:37.97]I'm like, what?
[37:38.89]Is something wrong?
[37:41.03]I don't know why she's not talking to me for some reason.
[38:00.09]Alright, let's go in there and just start breaking things.
[38:03.63]I'm talking smash.
[38:05.07]Smash.
[38:06.27]Smash.
[38:08.11]I'm a traffic detective from Central Division.
[38:10.11]Who's in charge here?
[38:11.27]I am, Gordon Lightfall.
[38:12.87]What's this about?
[38:14.35]We understand that your company prints California vehicle titles.
[38:17.67]Yes, I have the government contract to print... That tie's too short.
[38:20.70]That bottom of the tie's got to hit the top of your belt.
[38:23.28]Come on, Dave, we didn't fucking make you stupid.
[38:24.36]Have you had any goods or equipment stolen recently?
[38:26.56]We're running up against stolen cars with seemingly legitimate paperwork.
[38:30.38]Smash Brothers?
[38:31.46]It's a cool game.
[38:33.12]This guy sounds like me.
[38:37.16]Is this guy's name Zordon?
[38:47.55]Wait, is this guy's name... Who's the guy from... Who's Robin from the Dark Knight movies?
[38:55.44]Gordon Levitt, right?
[38:57.44]Is this... What's his name?
[39:06.34]Zordon Levitt, yeah.
[39:07.80]Zordon Levitt.
[39:14.46]Joseph Zordon Levitt.
[39:16.16]Okay.
[39:18.56]What the hell was I doing here?
[39:19.74]Why did I come here?
[39:20.34]Let's see if he's got fucking his gas and shit up to code.
[39:28.95]I thought I just fell off a cliff.
[39:31.17]What's going on with the hearts?
[39:32.13]What's happening?
[39:37.37]Love you, Jerma.
[39:38.43]What's with all the love?
[39:42.45]Hey, thanks, guys.
[39:46.59]You guys are awesome.
[39:47.29]Thanks.
[39:49.73]Just kind of came out of nowhere, didn't it?
[39:50.95]Well, thanks a lot, guys.
[40:00.13]Okay, where am I going?
[40:01.47]Is he still under the car?
[40:03.21]Is he under the car?
[40:05.13]Oh, God, he's under the car still.
[40:08.10]How do I get him out of the car?
[40:10.06]Where'd he go?
[40:11.20]Oh no, he's fine, okay.
[40:16.83]What was I doing?
[40:17.53]Oh fuck, I forget what I was doing.
[40:33.41]There's nothing else to do in there.
[40:34.43]Do I not have any evidence to do anything in here?
[40:38.72]Did you hear that ding?
[40:40.22]Please somebody heard that ding.
[40:41.92]Kim just made a really funny joke upstairs.
[40:47.14]I hope somebody heard that.
[40:53.01]She's doing her own stream of them making all kinds of funny fucking jokes.
[40:55.87]I can't do anything here.
[41:05.52]Slow and steady wins.
[41:06.94]The mods can't ban me at this pace.
[41:10.68]What?
[41:18.67]What the fuck are you talking about?
[41:20.11]Alright, I'm gonna go somewhere else.
[41:25.65]Fremont Avenue?
[41:26.43]I probably shouldn't have drank a bunch of champagne.
[41:28.63]Like, what the fuck I'm doing?
[41:33.37]Oh, you can get banned, by the way.
[41:35.25]Oh, don't you worry.
[41:36.57]You'll get banned.
[41:38.99]Those of you new to the channel, you'll get banned permanently.
[41:42.96]We have lifetime bans in this channel.
[41:47.86]If you don't know what a lifetime ban is, you better look it up.
[41:52.85]That is 10 to 15 seconds.
[41:56.01]Don't fuck up.
[42:02.05]I just mutilated that guy's car.
[42:05.39]Stop spamming emotes.
[42:14.93]Can I make it underneath?
[42:22.86]Well, I just got scared.
[42:23.92]I thought I couldn't make it.
[42:34.73]Slow down!
[42:37.91]Okay.
[42:39.37]I'm... Why is his car smoking?
[42:42.73]What did I... Why is his car smoking?
[42:45.85]Your car sucks, by the way, because my car... I was... I mean, I drove into a bunch of things, but your car should have been fine.
[42:52.34]You got a pickup truck.
[42:53.32]Ugh.
[42:59.43]His wheel fell off?
[43:00.36]Like, your car sucks, dude.
[43:01.68]Fuck you.
[43:02.08]I guess, yeah, we're not, like, in a uniform or anything, are we?
[43:30.34]emote only mode now.
[43:32.00]Oh god.
[43:33.24]Damn it.
[43:34.22]Is Minecraft on?
[43:35.26]No.
[43:35.66]Don't even.
[43:37.44]No.
[43:37.61]Fuck that.
[43:39.63]I am not having.
[43:41.41]I need to see this.
[43:42.91]Wait a second.
[43:45.01]This is important.
[43:46.71]This ain't gonna happen for one specific reason.
[43:50.75]Nope.
[43:52.26]No.
[43:54.64]Where's Minecraft?
[43:56.26]Type it in.
[43:56.78]It's so far over there.
[43:57.56]Ah!
[44:03.95]No, I'll have the most viewed Minecraft channel.
[44:05.91]No, that's not going to happen.
[44:08.46]I will be the number one Minecraft Twitch channel on stream if I go to Minecraft right now.
[44:13.84]No.
[44:16.50]That's no fucking way.
[44:36.77]Number one Minecraft stream on Twitch.
[44:54.74]I don't want that to be on a statistic.
[44:57.90]You think I want that to be something people can look up?
[45:00.60]Oh, who's the number one Minecraft stream on the whole platform?
[45:03.99]Oh, this guy.
[45:05.05]Can't wait to see more of that.
[45:08.49]No.
[45:14.98]Oh, no, the internet's turning off.
[45:16.36]No, it's not.
[45:21.42]It's only been like an hour and a half.
[45:23.72]No.
[45:24.02]You're a goddamn menace.
[45:28.59]No, it's not.
[45:29.11]Oh, no.
[45:29.91]We're okay.
[45:30.71]Everybody calm down.
[45:33.85]I thought this stream was going to be more than an hour.
[45:35.11]False address?
[45:37.31]Is it because... I think it's because I'm downloading Minecraft.
[45:39.60]Fucking Minecraft, man.
[45:59.08]Goddamn Minecraft.
[46:01.70]I'm downloading Minecraft.
[46:10.85]Stupid fucking goddamn.
[46:13.87]I gotta cancel this.
[46:18.82]It's gonna take like three hours to download.
[46:27.81]Where am I going?
[46:29.17]This way.
[46:29.73]Alright, let's go.
[46:34.87]Police station.
[46:35.59]We gotta find out what the fuck happened here.
[46:40.99]We're in emote-only mode.
[46:46.30]That's so funny.
[46:48.44]You'd throw up if you did that, by the way.
[46:50.82]What I just did right there, you would just throw up.
[46:54.70]That's like negative 50 G. People have, you die if that happens to you.
[46:59.19]Detectives, Belasco is prepped and ready in two.
[47:02.49]Another stolen car with legit papers.
[47:04.63]Thanks.
[47:07.77]Stolen car with legit papers.
[47:09.65]Interesting.
[47:15.30]Okay, so we got some clues here.
[47:17.50]What are we going to do about this?
[47:19.44]Talk to the chief?
[47:25.92]Who the fuck is in here?
[47:26.82]I don't even know who's in here.
[47:28.08]I'm so clueless.
[47:29.54]James Belasco?
[47:30.08]I shouldn't have drank and played this game.
[47:32.74]That was a bad idea.
[47:33.46]I might have to play Minecraft.
[47:55.24]that's a forgery of course it is you didn't even fill the back of the paper what are you doing okay let me see the evidence here belasco's ownership paper is in archer's ownership pictures legitimate pink slip made to gene archer
[48:23.79]How the fuck do you know Archer?
[48:25.01]Well, let's do this slow.
[48:25.97]What were you taking the car, James?
[48:27.57]Blow it off, Greenhorn.
[48:28.71]You'll get nothing from me.
[48:29.89]Punch in mouth.
[48:35.32]That was a little bit of De Niro.
[48:39.30]Mixed with... Yeah, fuck this guy.
[48:44.12]You're a two-time loser.
[48:45.47]If you don't give me something, I'm going to ask the DA for the maximum.
[48:48.21]You're looking at ten years, Belasco.
[48:50.39]Kiss your youth goodbye.
[48:52.65]Okay.
[48:53.73]I want to have a deal.
[48:54.35]I'm moving there.
[48:54.79]I'm moving.
[48:55.13]That was... Nobody take a picture of that.
[48:56.67]That was embarrassing.
[49:20.27]Beyonce could do what I can too.
[49:21.97]I can scrub that from the internet, you know.
[49:26.16]Does the name Jean Archer mean anything to you?
[49:29.84]Nope.
[49:30.98]Never heard of her.
[49:32.46]See?
[49:36.24]Seeing some swallowing action.
[49:39.65]Shifty eyes.
[49:43.69]Diarrhea on a plane, but you're too embarrassed to use the plane bathroom?
[49:47.45]Yeah.
[49:49.61]You want my partner here to convince you that you do know her?
[49:53.01]I'm giving you the straight dope.
[49:54.77]I don't know no Gene Archer.
[50:01.31]What happens to the cars once they cross over the state lines?
[50:04.84]I don't know.
[50:05.62]I just deliver them.
[50:08.46]That's a lie.
[50:09.40]Let's catch him in a real lie.
[50:10.58]What do you say?
[50:13.56]I don't have any evidence.
[50:16.29]Turn off emote only mode so I can see the answer.
[50:19.55]I can pretend I'm playing the game, and I can look over at chat after stalling and making a couple of jokes, and I can see the answer in the chat.
[50:29.69]Like, oh, I wonder if he's lying or not.
[50:31.62]It's interesting.
[50:33.06]That's weird.
[50:34.98]This guy reminds me of when... One time, the police got called on me when I was a teenager because I threw an egg at the ground.
[50:45.25]Weirdly enough, the answer was accused?
[50:47.77]Wow, I got that myself.
[50:52.37]Turn it off, though, for real.
[50:57.21]Turn it off.
[50:57.47]Turn it off.
[50:58.25]Let's hear it.
[50:59.35]I need to know the answer.
[51:08.65]Oh, fuck.
[51:10.63]Alright.
[51:11.15]So, I have my own deduction.
[51:14.17]Hmm.
[51:16.13]Uh, accuse him maybe, I think.
[51:17.91]Maybe?
[51:18.31]That's what I'm deducing from my own intelligence?
[51:21.65]Possibly?
[51:22.21]Yeah, I think so.
[51:23.24]Hmm.
[51:23.32]Okay.
[51:23.78]Now, hmm, which one of these would I do if I was, like, picking one myself?
[51:27.62]Let me just, like, deduce it.
[51:47.21]You know, I'm sitting here.
[51:50.75]If I was a detective, stolen vehicle receipt, like, padding time on the stream to, like, get the answer, bill of sale?
[51:59.22]You know what I mean?
[52:03.48]I'm probably the stolen auto courier.
[52:10.65]I would probably say so.
[52:14.50]You guys were wrong!
[52:15.08]He's supposed to-
[52:30.58]You guys were wrong.
[52:31.48]Thanks.
[52:32.08]Thanks for nothing.
[52:32.59]God damn it, man.
[52:33.71]Yeah, put it back to emote-only mode.
[52:34.87]What the fuck?
[52:35.31]Supposed to be getting answers here.
[52:37.73]Respect the streamer.
[52:38.27]Give answers to the streamer.
[52:51.87]Don't.
[52:53.17]I can't fuck around here.
[52:54.57]I'm out of here in like a fucking less than a week.
[53:01.62]I'm not dumping shit on the ground.
[53:03.68]Wait, what is this?
[53:04.60]Joseph Gordon Levitt.
[53:09.30]Look at mods.
[53:10.40]Take it off emote only mode when there's an answer I need to have.
[53:12.62]You know what I'm saying?
[53:17.95]People can put their funny emotes in chat and then when I, you know, oh fuck, I'm having... What's the answer?
[53:23.54]Take it off.
[53:30.26]Alright, where are we going?
[53:33.54]Just follow the exit signs.
[53:41.35]There's more to do here.
[53:42.59]Is there another person here?
[53:46.97]To interview?
[53:53.35]I've said all I'm going to say.
[53:58.05]Okay, so maybe take it off emote only mode for a second or two.
[54:02.35]Phelps, your GTA suspect, Gene Archer.
[54:06.15]GTA.
[54:06.49]Spotted by a patrolman.
[54:07.85]Western Union office, 253 South Hill.
[54:10.27]Keep it on.
[54:10.63]Keep emote only mode on.
[54:12.49]Turn it back on.
[54:14.38]She won't hang around.
[54:15.28]I didn't need him.
[54:20.94]Alright.
[54:21.32]Western Union office, let's go.
[54:27.63]That's the destination, cool.
[54:39.67]Get the fuck out of the car.
[54:48.99]Alright, quickly, let's go!
[54:57.68]Alright.
[54:59.90]Just to make sure I had enough room.
[55:01.06]You know, this isn't a tank, Phelps.
[55:07.08]Let's question the suspect.
[55:09.72]I think they've learned their lesson.
[55:10.72]Take it off emote only mode, if you could, please.
[55:22.08]LAPD.
[55:23.22]We'll take it from here.
[55:24.18]God damn it.
[55:25.99]Under arrest.
[55:26.29]Under arrest.
[55:27.49]What was that Madlib bullshit?
[55:28.99]Hair, shirt, cup.
[55:29.39]That was a noun, a noun, and a noun.
[55:55.96]Where's your adjective?
[55:58.64]Where's your verb?
[56:00.72]Come on, man.
[56:01.54]You can do better than that.
[56:02.20]Got it.
[56:03.60]That's a lie.
[56:03.92]No, you did.
[56:04.20]Yes, you did.
[56:04.58]Yeah.
[56:28.96]Hold on a second.
[56:35.30]This is made to Cliff Harrison.
[56:37.47]Sorry.
[56:39.97]I mean, she's very clearly lying.
[56:47.13]I would say, right?
[56:52.84]Hold on, my webcam got, like, fucked up for a second here.
[57:08.33]I've got to put the webcam in the corner.
[57:16.79]You're lying.
[57:17.93]James Belasco.
[57:19.19]I don't remember mentioning his first name, Miss Archer.
[57:21.33]Oh, I... Well, I think you did, didn't you?
[57:24.37]My webcam looks alright there.
[57:25.66]Thanks for the tip.
[57:26.84]Anyway, I don't know him.
[57:30.88]Got it.
[57:33.42]That's right.
[57:34.60]We got her.
[57:37.49]That's right.
[57:38.51]We got her.
[58:01.76]What?
[58:04.61]Call me an old man?
[58:05.53]Alright, so I was... Let me go figure this out.
[58:22.76]Can we just get this over with?
[58:41.61]I figured that out.
[58:42.21]It's fucking hard.
[58:42.81]And don't try and sell the car?
[58:44.51]Yeah, that too.
[59:04.67]Alright.
[59:05.39]I don't care.
[59:05.81]I picked up the car, Miss Archer.
[59:07.37]Look, I can't remember.
[59:09.69]Let me go, will you?
[59:11.37]Please.
[59:13.08]What have I got to do?
[59:14.08]I don't...
[59:33.11]Stop doing that.
[59:33.98]Nice commentary.
[59:34.38]I don't want to talk over the fucking cutscene.
[59:36.66]Talking over the cutscene is incredibly rude.
[59:55.64]I want you guys to be able to hear the things that are going on and see the things that are going on.
[59:58.68]So why would I fucking talk over it?
[60:00.88]I want you to see and experience the game with me blindly because I never played it.
[60:05.80]You understand?
[60:06.96]I'm not going to cut in and fuck up the whole thing.
[60:12.07]So I want you to listen to it.
[60:13.57]So let's listen to it.
[60:14.33]Well, it's over, but the next one.

[60:56.02]I had some of the friends and some other people came.
[60:59.58]We talked about the channel.
[61:01.66]It was a really good time.
[61:05.18]But I didn't put on the stream lab, so let me make sure I get that on.
[61:08.20]It was really fun.

[62:42.03]Or like, oh look, there's a picture of your dick.
[62:45.53]I'm not sure.
[62:46.01]I'm probably more embarrassed by the Minecraft.
[62:49.31]I'm not kidding.
[62:50.39]I'm not even kidding.
[62:53.19]Oh, Jerma, like a picture of your dick leaked.
[62:55.49]Oh, whatever.

[63:40.28]Look at that, I can see it right now.
[63:41.10]Alright, let me make sure I didn't miss anything.
[63:47.83]Uh, we had some big money.
[63:50.01]Uh, big money from... Kyra Toby gave $100.
[63:59.44]He said, that was no chug.
[64:00.46]That was a big sip.
[64:01.26]Try butt chugging.
[64:03.56]No.
[64:04.26]I'm not gonna do that.
[64:07.10]Uh, the creeper is demanded.
[64:08.78]Talking about Minecraft.
[64:09.64]Thank you so much, Kairotobi, for your hundred bucks.
[64:14.12]Thank you so much.
[64:14.76]Why would somebody do that?
[64:19.12]Just drink it normally.
[64:20.26]Just drink the beer.
[64:23.72]Just drink it.
[64:27.06]What the hell would you do that for?
[64:32.31]I wanna get drunk in 10 seconds!
[64:34.15]Dude, you'll get drunk in like 20 minutes!
[64:36.58]Just cool it!
[64:42.16]You get drunk faster!
[64:43.15]Just drink it!
[64:44.35]Just sip it!
[64:45.07]You'll be fine!
[64:50.15]I'm gonna have to butt-chug alcohol.
[64:51.75]I gotta get drunk quick.
[64:52.59]Like, what is going on that you need to get drunk that quickly?
[64:54.91]You know what I mean?
[64:55.91]I'm thinking of every scenario.
[64:57.15]You're at a wedding.
[64:57.73]Oh, I gotta butt-chug at this wedding.
[64:59.82]No, you don't.
[65:00.34]For what?
[65:01.12]Ugh.
[65:19.48]You got caught playing Minecraft.
[65:22.52]2017.
[65:22.56]That was a year ago.
[65:23.74]I'm sorry.
[65:24.78]Okay, the statute of Minecraft limitations, I think, is like six months.
[65:28.57]Right?
[65:44.56]Like, oh, you get caught with, like, drugs.
[65:46.50]Okay, well, but the statute of Minecraft limitations is a year.
[65:49.72]Like, six months.
[65:50.34]What does it feel like if you get caught with, like, drugs?
[65:57.32]What's the statute of limitations on drugs?
[66:01.18]It's like, what, like a year or two years?
[66:12.63]Ten years.
[66:13.39]What?
[66:15.46]No, it's not.
[66:16.04]Hold on.
[66:21.38]The statute of limitations for drugs is ten years?
[66:24.22]What?
[66:25.85]Five years.
[66:47.28]One guy said that.
[66:48.74]One day you'll be the one guy.
[66:49.96]Some of you guys new to the channel, at some point you'll be the one person that writes one sentence and I will address it.
[66:55.99]Hey, make sure you go over the box.
[67:21.32]Call Phelps, LAPD.
[67:23.56]All of you are coming downtown with me.
[67:31.07]Kill a cop, and it's the electric chair.
[67:39.39]Yeah, that'll stop.
[67:42.27]That'll cut it out.
[67:44.23]You're gonna get the fucking electric chair if you shoot me.
[67:48.75]Throw out the guns.
[68:31.70]Why did I take a sip?
[68:32.82]I took a sip and I looked over and somebody said, what are you shooting at?
[68:37.56]Oh, my fucking eyes.
[68:38.72]God damn it.
[68:39.28]Hmm.
[68:58.86]Why would I take a sip after that?
[68:59.92]That was so stupid.
[69:07.84]What are you?
[69:08.48]And it was in lowercase.
[69:09.70]Hold on a second.
[69:23.49]That person was pissed.
[69:25.25]They really were.
[69:26.01]God damn it.

[72:59.02]What?
[73:05.00]Dude, do a butt jump.
[73:06.36]Come on, bro.
[73:17.02]There's something over here to look at.
[73:19.16]What am I looking at?
[73:20.50]No, what is it?
[73:21.28]Oh, it is the butt chug.
[73:22.68]Okay, what is it?
[73:37.47]Let's go.
[73:45.65]Fridge?
[73:46.13]No.
[73:48.58]He touched the part that goes in the butt.
[73:51.37]No, I did not.
[73:52.43]I... Why am I... Goddamn motherfucker.
[74:05.19]What does he want me to do?
[74:20.71]Oh, here we go.
[74:21.59]I found a solution.
[74:25.51]No, God damn it.
[74:29.73]Okay, we're fine.
[74:30.33]Alright, let's talk.
[74:44.44]Let's talk.
[74:58.66]So it's all fakes.
[75:06.14]From the marquee printing company, I understand.
[75:09.98]How do I cuff him?
[75:15.04]Yeah, how do I cuff him?
[75:26.47]Hmm.
[75:28.02]So you get a bunch of bullshit slips.
[75:33.26]Okay.
[75:37.50]Sure thing.
[75:37.96]What about over here?
[75:38.54]We got some scratch tickets that didn't win.
[75:42.25]Check them, though.
[75:45.53]Even if you find them on the ground, check them.
[75:46.99]They might have won $50.
[75:47.57]Okay.
[75:55.89]I'm giving myself that one.
[75:57.57]You've got a trail of pink slips and stolen cars that leads right to your door, Bigelow.
[76:01.95]You're in this up to your neck.
[76:03.45]But I don't think you're the man in charge.
[76:05.35]Make it easier on yourself.
[76:06.65]Give him up.
[76:07.87]I do work on cars for customs.
[76:09.73]You charge in here shooting up the place like it's the Ballad of Bulge.
[76:13.40]I can't give you anything.
[76:15.70]Oh, really?
[76:17.78]Oh, well, what about the pink slips, dude?
[76:20.40]You can make this easier on yourself by giving us your man on the inside.
[76:25.43]I sometimes repair cars and put them back on the road.
[76:28.21]I need a pink slip to resell them.
[76:30.55]There's no problem there.
[76:37.11]That's a lie.
[76:42.71]Alright, dude, you're essentially a dog right now.
[76:47.43]Don't lie to me.
[76:47.99]I'm not in the mood for any more lies.
[76:50.85]The slip's in a real deal, and I ordered them from Marquis.
[76:56.45]Really?
[76:59.03]Hmm.
[77:04.44]Why am I getting ha-ha'd?
[77:05.70]What did I do?
[77:08.69]What did I do?
[77:09.77]Why am I getting ha-ha'd right now?
[77:12.33]What the heck?
[77:21.05]I want a mouthpiece.
[77:22.89]The organization employs a very good one.
[77:25.26]It does a great job of keeping Mickey C out on the streets.
[77:28.68]Now put it in emote-only mode, please.
[77:31.04]Whether you give up your bosses or not, Bigelow.
[77:33.22]What?
[77:33.36]I don't understand.
[77:34.08]As long as I can put you there.
[77:36.68]We'll see.
[77:38.13]I didn't fire a shot, Kappa.
[77:39.93]I just watched you tear my place up.
[77:43.21]Kappa?
[77:53.55]Don't want anything.
[77:54.05]I don't want anything in this chat Unless it's a Kappa.
[77:58.49]I'm serious.
[77:59.17]I'm not even kidding if I see one fucking message.
[78:02.53]That's not a Kappa I Will I will turn off my internet at some point over the next 12 hours?
[78:10.85]Don't fuck with me here.
[78:12.11]I'll do it I Will call I will get my internet turned off I
[78:21.60]No, see, you guys aren't fucking playing along here.
[78:26.87]I thought you guys were better than that.

[78:28.67]Unfortunately.
[78:32.35]Okay.
[78:33.59]Well, I'm going to have to make the phone call and get my internet turned off in the next 12 hours.
[78:37.26]Goddamn, I don't want to do that.
[78:39.40]Don't make me do that.
[78:40.04]I don't want to do that.
[78:40.80]What the heck, man?
[78:47.29]LAPD, police emergency.
[78:48.85]You can't do this!
[78:56.51]Alright, get in.
[78:57.09]Alright, take it off emote only.
[78:58.53]What a mess.
[79:19.23]We didn't have a lot of choice You have to admire the barefaced cheek of someone who tries to blow your brains out one minute and pleads innocence the next Especially when he's surrounded by evidence Jeremy I'm here spend so much time convincing themselves Why not doing anything wrong that they actually start to believe their own bullshit?
[79:36.77]They get sloppy Bigelow light ball all of them if they hadn't who knows how long they could have kept this racket.
[79:43.11]Oh It's always one of the two discover that area, please.

[89:10.31]What a waste of bandwidth that would be.
[89:20.54]No.
[89:23.63]You shouldn't bring guns to work with them.
[89:25.23]We didn't have a lot of choice.
[89:26.53]You have to admire the barefaced cheek of someone who tries to blow your brains out one minute and pleads innocence the next.
[89:32.25]Yeah, especially when he's surrounded by evidence.
[89:34.95]Don't.
[89:35.53]Don't you fuck?
[89:36.21]Hey, watch your language.
[89:37.99]They're not doing anything wrong.
[89:39.51]That they actually start to believe their own bullshit.

[101:10.02]Alright, let's go.
[101:29.13]And got the cork.
[101:30.77]My family runs a shipping business in San Francisco.
[101:32.87]I'll vacuum.
[101:33.63]Sorry, vacuum.
[101:34.43]They ship two ships a week to Tokyo.
[101:37.09]We've been in shipping for two generations, Hank.
[101:39.87]I've never been on a voyage anywhere.
[101:41.11]I feel like Odysseus at the beginning of his journey.
[101:43.69]The Odyssey took ten years, Cole.
[101:48.05]This is the American century.
[101:50.07]America can rule the world after we win this war.
[101:53.73]We need to stay alive, Cole.
[101:56.52]These men are counting on us.
[101:58.84]Hear what the veterans are saying to each other?
[102:01.38]No.
[102:02.92]Golden Gate in 48.
[102:04.14]That's four more hard years of fighting.
[102:49.79]Phelps, Bukowski, you have a new case.
[102:52.17]Two women, possible drink drive.
[102:54.35]How is that a case?
[102:55.97]The broad says she was doped and that somebody tried to kill her.
[102:59.56]Where did this take place?
[103:01.62]That's the bit you're gonna love.
[103:03.56]Right across the street.
[103:05.40]What?
[103:07.06]A Chevy Style Line took a nosedive off the escarpment, fetched up underneath a Cola King billboard.
[103:13.57]Up to it, boys.
[103:14.35]We got bad guys to catch.
[103:17.98]I'm telling you, it'll never stick, and you'll get Rosie.
[103:20.39]See you later, fellas.
[103:23.93]Try not to work too hard.
[103:25.95]Look at you, bantering with the boys.
[103:28.43]It was a tear to my eye watching my caterpillar grow wings.
[103:32.41]I'm just trying to fit in.
[103:34.53]Educated, hardworking, straight as an arrow.
[103:36.81]I hate to break it to you, Cole, but you'll never fit in, son.
[103:40.11]You got something to say now?
[103:51.26]You got something to say, no?
[103:59.92]Somebody gave a hundred bucks.
[104:06.55]Who gave a hundred dollars right now?
[104:08.85]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a second.
[104:14.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[104:17.25]Somebody gave way more than that.
[104:22.43]Oh man, how the fuck do I see this?
[104:31.83]My brain is so small.
[104:33.37]Uh, Jabba Dab?
[104:33.83]Jabba Dab gave $150.
[104:35.85]Holy shit, dude.
[104:38.59]Hello from Scotland.
[104:39.59]Thought for a second when you climbed through the window that you were on the second floor.
[104:42.85]No, I am.
[104:45.11]I like scaled the building.
[104:47.32]Like, extremely quickly.
[104:50.76]That's a lot of money, dude.

[105:13.63]Holy shit, man.
[105:14.35]Hold on.

[105:44.03]$200 fucking dollars.
[105:46.51]Thank you, JabbaDab.
[105:49.25]Is that the house?
[105:49.81]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[105:50.93]Look, this place, I can't fucking destroy this place.
[105:55.37]Why would I do that anyways?
[105:56.45]What do you think I'm, a psycho?
[106:02.72]No problem.
[106:03.34]You're worth every penny.
[106:05.40]That means a lot, dude.
[106:06.42]Seriously.

[106:14.00]Glad you're having a good time.
[106:18.48]Thanks a lot.
[106:18.84]That's all I can say.
[106:23.32]And with that... No, just kidding.
[106:27.82]No, no, no.
[106:28.10]I don't... You know, what's new?
[106:29.93]What's new, PlayStation?
[106:30.73]And why not?
[106:32.91]What'd I get?
[106:33.43]Let's look at my trophies.

[107:18.05]He's a real gamer, man.
[107:20.63]Works at fucking high res.
[107:22.17]He's a real gamer.
[107:28.44]Alright, let's get back to it.
[107:37.34]Did I do crash site?
[107:39.21]Wait, what?
[107:44.12]Is this the last?
[107:47.28]I have a dev in my friends list?
[107:48.62]No, I don't.
[107:50.16]Nobody talks to me.
[107:53.72]Guys, I talk so much shit, nobody likes me.
[107:58.68]Like, I don't have any, like, dev friends or sponsor friends.

[171:20.13]A scale of 1 to 10? 2.
[171:36.82]Look, I need to relax.
[171:38.24]It's been so stressful.
[171:40.74]The last like two or three weeks.
[171:43.06]The last two months.
[171:44.09]What, am I kidding myself?
[171:46.89]I'm just having a good time.
